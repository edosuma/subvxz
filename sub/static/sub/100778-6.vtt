00:10.802 --> 00:13.013
[Claire shrieking]
Mother! Mother! Wake up!

00:13.096 --> 00:15.890
-[gasps] What's wrong?
-The house is on fire!

00:16.057 --> 00:18.101
-[gasps]
-Fire department? It's an emergency,

00:18.184 --> 00:19.811
-our house is burning.
-Come, come, come!

00:30.196 --> 00:32.198
[fire rumbling]

00:35.201 --> 00:36.578
Oh, my God.

00:40.331 --> 00:43.043
[siren wailing]

00:58.558 --> 01:00.185
[glass shattering]

01:02.479 --> 01:03.354
Shit!

01:03.813 --> 01:04.814
Oh, my God.

01:06.649 --> 01:07.859
Whoa!

01:09.944 --> 01:10.862
Are you okay?

01:14.032 --> 01:15.575
[siren wailing]

01:16.326 --> 01:17.202
Jesus Christ.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.412
-[man] We don't want you here!
-[horn honking]

01:19.537 --> 01:21.164
We should've let the studio put us up.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.875
-Keep movies white!
-I will not live in fear.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.210
[horn honking]

01:25.293 --> 01:26.461
[crowd clamoring]

01:26.836 --> 01:27.796
Son of a bitch!

01:28.505 --> 01:29.923
No miscegenation!

01:30.840 --> 01:33.093
No miscegenation in America!

01:33.968 --> 01:35.929
[Dick] We filed a report with the FBI.

01:36.012 --> 01:38.932
I know you do not want to move into
one of the bungalows here on the lot,

01:39.015 --> 01:40.850
I get it,
no one wants to feel like a prisoner.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.853
So we're going to have round-the-clock
surveillance outside of your house,

01:43.937 --> 01:45.355
Avis's, and Archie's.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.316
This feeling is nothing new.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.235
I grew up getting terrorized.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.946
Had a uncle that was pulled out
of his bed in the middle of the night

01:53.029 --> 01:55.448
and hanged from a tree, so... I'm angry,

01:55.532 --> 01:57.867
I'm scared,
but what I am not is surprised.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.494
But who is it that's doing this?

01:59.577 --> 02:02.831
American Colonization Society.
The same people picketing outside.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.415
They say they're peaceful,

02:04.499 --> 02:06.459
just want to send colored people
to Liberia,

02:06.543 --> 02:08.294
but a lot of them are secretly KKK.

02:08.378 --> 02:11.172
If I may, as producer of this film--

02:11.256 --> 02:14.759
<i>A</i> producer,
and "producer" should be in quotes.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.762
This is going to continue,
that's just a fact of life,

02:17.846 --> 02:20.807
and Avis, you are going to have to pay
to protect this production.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.060
There will be protests outside this gate
every day we are shooting

02:24.144 --> 02:27.522
-and every day we're on location.
-Mr. Silver, you can't go in there.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.149
-Don't get up.
-I won't.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.567
In light of recent events,

02:30.650 --> 02:33.319
I've come to inform you
that production on <i>Meg</i> must be halted.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.613
Didn't I fire you weeks ago?

02:35.697 --> 02:37.991
You don't have that power.
I work for Mr. Amberg.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.159
That is out of line.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.369
Refusing to shut this picture down
is out of line.

02:41.452 --> 02:44.747
Mrs. Amberg leaves me no option
but to take legal action.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.166
This is my studio.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.043
I recognize that
this is emotional for you.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.671
With all that's been happening,
you're not thinking clearly.

02:51.754 --> 02:52.630
Oh.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.675
A woman makes a decision,
and suddenly she's irrational.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.969
-No, no. That's-- I didn't mean to--
-Yes, you did.

02:58.887 --> 03:03.892
You waltz in here whenever you desire
to remind me that you are there,

03:04.184 --> 03:05.518
always watching.

03:06.227 --> 03:09.939
By the time you get your ducks in a row
for our little date in court,

03:10.023 --> 03:11.482
my picture will be in the can.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.442
[snickers]

03:15.486 --> 03:16.696
See you in court, Lon.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.077
What are you all grinning about?

03:24.913 --> 03:26.122
We have a movie to make.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.166
[big band music playing]

04:14.629 --> 04:15.505
[bell dings]

04:24.931 --> 04:26.224
[bell dings]

04:27.016 --> 04:28.768
[Ernie] Well, look who it is.

04:33.022 --> 04:38.111
So you guys want to raise $25,000 to pay
for your movie's Hollywoodland sign.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.445
Happy to help.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.614
Today's assignment...

04:41.698 --> 04:42.699
[hacking]

04:44.951 --> 04:46.244
[exhales and sniffles]

04:46.369 --> 04:47.662
[hoarsely] Today's assignment...

04:49.330 --> 04:50.999
go home. All of youse.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.750
-What?
-[Ernie] I mean it.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.711
I can't have you doing this.
It's too risky.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.296
Jack, you've already been busted once.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.508
Here you are.

05:02.635 --> 05:03.511
All of you.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.388
Young.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.516
At the beginning of something.

05:10.143 --> 05:10.977
Me?

05:12.312 --> 05:13.646
I ain't risking much.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.190
I'm near the end.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.153
But I've had a great run.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.407
This isn't the dream I started with...

05:27.035 --> 05:27.994
doing this.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.079
But you kids,

05:31.622 --> 05:34.917
your dreams are really happening.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.628
And I like that you're fighting for 'em.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.757
So, let me handle this.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.552
I will get you your money.
I will get you your money.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.013
I got some old-timers
who used to work for me.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.223
I thought I'd call 'em out of retirement
for a good cause.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.767
Ernie, you hardly know me.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.769
It ain't for you.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.314
It's for the dream.

05:58.232 --> 06:00.360
Now, get outta here, all of youse.
I got work to do.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.445
[big band music playing]

06:05.031 --> 06:06.491
[bell dinging]

06:11.204 --> 06:12.914
[Ernie] There's my girls.

06:12.997 --> 06:14.082
Hey, Ern.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.759
[man grunts]

06:24.842 --> 06:26.302
[door bell rings]

06:27.762 --> 06:28.763
Hello, ladies.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.184
[bell dinging]

06:37.146 --> 06:38.856
-[grunting]
-Quit struggling, you pervert!

06:40.066 --> 06:41.192
Can it, sicko!

06:42.193 --> 06:43.986
Hold on a sec. You comfortable?

06:44.070 --> 06:46.072
-Mm-hmm.
-Keep your mouth shut!

06:46.239 --> 06:47.990
Or I'll throw you off
the Shakespeare Bridge!

06:52.787 --> 06:53.830
[client moans]

06:53.913 --> 06:55.248
[bell dinging]

06:55.998 --> 06:57.041
[grunts]

06:57.708 --> 07:00.044
So I tied you pretty loose.
You should be able to wiggle out.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.255
-I'll be over there if you need me.
-[grunting]

07:02.338 --> 07:04.424
-What?
-Stay in character!

07:04.882 --> 07:09.095
Uh, sorry. I mean, I'm going to
leave you here to rot, you pervert!

07:09.178 --> 07:10.680
-Mmm!
-This was fun.

07:10.763 --> 07:11.764
[grunting]

07:13.891 --> 07:14.892
[bell dinging]

07:32.702 --> 07:33.870
[grunts]

07:34.829 --> 07:36.038
[exhales]

07:41.127 --> 07:42.378
[exhales] Yeah.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.256
Twenty-five big ones.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.342
I can't believe it only took you one week.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.428
What can I tell you?
I'm good at what I do.

07:50.511 --> 07:53.473
And I've been saving up for a rainy day.
I tossed that in too.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.892
-Ernie, this is unbelievable.
-Ah, kid, it's nothing.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.185
It didn't even feel like work.

07:57.268 --> 08:00.396
You know, Ernie, me and Raymond have been
talking about how to thank you.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.941
Henry Willson got a producer credit on
this picture, and he hardly did anything.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.109
No, I won't hear it.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.652
-Ernie, please--
-I said no.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.446
That money's yours.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.698
I don't want anything in return.
I mean it.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.701
Consider it my...

08:14.952 --> 08:15.953
my parting gift

08:16.454 --> 08:17.288
to this town.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.290
Okay?

08:21.918 --> 08:22.877
Go make your movie.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.172
Thank you, Ernie.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.715
[chuckling]

08:28.257 --> 08:30.134
[Archie yelping]

08:31.260 --> 08:33.137
There ain't nobody quite like you, Ernie.

08:45.942 --> 08:50.446
We made up the difference.
That's all of it, $25,000.

08:50.821 --> 08:51.656
How'd you do it?

08:52.323 --> 08:53.157
Does it matter?

08:53.783 --> 08:54.617
Fair enough.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.620
All right, get it done.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.541
[woman speaking over intercom]

09:01.624 --> 09:02.750
[babies crying]

09:10.800 --> 09:11.634
Oh, no.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.803
I knew this moment would come.

09:16.430 --> 09:19.433
Mmm. So, do it. [chuckles nervously]

09:19.517 --> 09:21.227
I deserve it. Hit me.

09:23.729 --> 09:24.814
I'm not gonna hit you.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.442
I'm just here to make sure
everybody's doing okay.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.781
[Erwin] Henrietta was right about you.

09:35.032 --> 09:39.328
She said you had
your share of problems, but...

09:40.037 --> 09:41.998
deep down, you were a good person.

10:00.850 --> 10:01.726
I, uh...

10:02.351 --> 10:04.687
I know you're skipping town
in a few days, but...

10:06.897 --> 10:08.274
just wanted to say goodbye.

10:11.527 --> 10:15.573
As far as the divorce goes, you know,
I'm not going to make a stink.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.994
[voice shaking]
Whatever you need from me, you got it.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.081
[shuddering sigh]

10:25.791 --> 10:26.792
Do you want to...

10:33.758 --> 10:35.509
I'm sorry we screwed this up, Hen.

10:37.511 --> 10:38.679
[chuckles]

10:42.308 --> 10:44.602
[voice breaking] Maybe it was meant to be.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.314
We both got what we wanted.

10:49.523 --> 10:53.653
I get to start a family,
and you get to be a movie star.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.240
I'm always going to see your movies...

10:59.575 --> 11:01.494
and I hope...

11:02.787 --> 11:05.748
that maybe I had something to do with it.
[chuckles and sniffles]

11:05.831 --> 11:06.874
Of course you did.

11:08.417 --> 11:09.835
Of course you did, baby.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.712
I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.508
[crying]

11:15.633 --> 11:17.510
You're always going to be a part of it.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.390
I just hope that I'll always be
a part of you.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.731
I'm so sorry, Hen.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.401
Me too, Jack.

11:34.276 --> 11:35.152
Me too.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.612
[both weeping]

11:40.032 --> 11:42.159
-[Ernie] Hey there, fellas!
-Hey!

11:42.243 --> 11:43.703
[tapping shoes]

11:48.124 --> 11:49.291
[all chuckling]

11:49.458 --> 11:52.920
I'm having a big fancy dinner
with a genuine screenwriter

11:53.003 --> 11:55.506
and a real-life movie star
in the middle of production no less?

11:55.965 --> 11:58.259
I must be some kind of heavy hitter, huh?

11:58.342 --> 12:00.261
Fancy dinner's the least we could do, Ern.

12:00.344 --> 12:01.554
Yeah, we owe you, Ernie.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.974
I mean, if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't even be in this town anymore.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.809
So, how's shooting going? Having fun?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.854
Today was Jack's first day. He was great.

12:09.937 --> 12:10.896
I don't know about that,

12:10.980 --> 12:13.524
but I said all my lines
and didn't trip over the furniture. So...

12:13.607 --> 12:15.109
See! You're halfway there.

12:15.192 --> 12:16.026
How's the wife?

12:21.824 --> 12:24.410
-Let's talk about something else.
-Why, what'd I say?

12:24.493 --> 12:25.953
Nothing, you didn't say anything.

12:26.871 --> 12:27.872
It's all right, I...

12:29.039 --> 12:30.249
[sighs]

12:31.584 --> 12:33.794
Henrietta left me for another fella,

12:35.296 --> 12:38.591
and apparently the, uh...  babies are his.

12:42.636 --> 12:45.097
Are you kidding me, Jack?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.099
That's...

12:47.600 --> 12:48.434
great!

12:48.517 --> 12:49.602
Yeah... W-- what?

12:49.685 --> 12:51.228
Think about it.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.271
Here you are...

12:52.897 --> 12:54.231
young buck on the town,

12:54.315 --> 12:57.067
about to be the next big thing
with his name up in lights.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.569
You don't want to be tied down.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.530
-You know you got a way with words, Ernie?
-[Ernie chuckles]

13:01.614 --> 13:03.491
I somehow think I actually feel
a little better.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.618
-Hmm?
-But look, what are we here for?

13:06.327 --> 13:07.369
We got something for you.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.246
What?

13:11.123 --> 13:12.833
[Jack] Take a look at page 35.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.378
[Ernie] Oh, man.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.590
This is some crackerjack dialogue.

13:21.008 --> 13:25.596
"Studio chief Daryl B. Selzman enters.
No-nonsense. Dashing."

13:25.679 --> 13:27.431
It was supposed to be David O. Selznick,

13:27.515 --> 13:29.850
but he caught wind of it
and threatened to sue.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.102
You're not playing the Selznick part,
are you?

13:32.228 --> 13:33.145
No, Ernie.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.314
You are.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.987
What are you talking about?

13:42.613 --> 13:44.740
Daryl B. Selzman.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.201
That's you.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.078
That's your role.

13:49.745 --> 13:51.497
The studio okayed it and everything.

13:52.081 --> 13:52.915
What?

13:52.998 --> 13:54.792
[Jack]
I know it's a bit of a stretch, but...

13:55.209 --> 13:57.586
Archie's been taking some liberties
with the screenplay,

13:57.670 --> 13:59.547
and Ray really wants him to be...

14:00.422 --> 14:01.799
well, dashing.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.230
Hey. What? Wh-- what's the matter, Ern?

14:19.859 --> 14:20.860
It just hit me.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.698
I came out here...

14:28.534 --> 14:29.660
and I had a dream.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.372
Just like you guys.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.169
Took me almost 30 years...

14:42.548 --> 14:43.966
but it's finally coming true.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.098
To Hollywood.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.351
To Hollywood.

14:54.977 --> 14:55.895
[glasses clink]

14:55.978 --> 14:57.438
[protesters shouting]

15:01.901 --> 15:04.361
[Ellen]
Pleased to have you on board, Mr. West.

15:04.778 --> 15:08.073
You've had quite the hiatus
between acting jobs.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.451
Yeah, you know how it goes.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.328
You pound the pavement
for a couple of years,

15:12.411 --> 15:14.997
then you take a side gig to pay the bills,
and before you know it,

15:15.080 --> 15:17.416
it ain't a side gig anymore;
it's your life.

15:17.666 --> 15:21.378
Yes, well, running a prostitution ring
out of a gas station

15:21.503 --> 15:24.757
would always be a more lucrative
endeavor than being an actor.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.553
I don't judge you, Ernie.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.221
In fact,

15:31.931 --> 15:34.350
it's one of the reasons
why I like you for this role.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.393
Your big scene is all about

15:36.769 --> 15:40.397
freedom of expression
in the face of censorship and prejudice.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.733
There's lesbian overtones
in one of your films,

15:42.816 --> 15:46.570
and the studio relations committee
throws the Hays Code at you,

15:46.654 --> 15:48.697
tells you you have to cut
all of Meg's scenes.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.783
Yeah, and I tell them to go screw.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.785
[laughing] I love it.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.746
I get to stick it to those assholes
and all their moralizing.

15:55.829 --> 15:58.207
Yes, but he's not a thug.

15:59.083 --> 16:02.544
There's a refinement to him.
He's powerful, and he knows it.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.673
This is why I want to do some rehearsal
with you on your feet.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.508
I do this with all our players.

16:07.591 --> 16:10.177
I want to see how your character smokes
a cigarette,

16:10.260 --> 16:11.512
how he walks into a room.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.722
What? Nah.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.308
I don't need to rehearse
that kind of stuff.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.643
I know how to walk.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.564
Acting isn't magic.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.566
It's a job.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.235
It's a craft.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.737
It's something you have to work at,

16:29.029 --> 16:31.073
something you devote your time to.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.619
So let's get to work.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.665
-Action!
-[door opens]

16:41.291 --> 16:43.544
So, I gotta cut my best actress
from this picture, huh?

16:43.627 --> 16:45.546
Well, guess what? I'm not doing it!

16:45.629 --> 16:47.297
-Too angry.
-But he is angry.

16:47.381 --> 16:51.010
Yes, of course,
but he's powerful, and he knows it.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.302
He doesn't need to yell.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.222
And you need to leave yourself
someplace to go.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.181
Yeah, okay.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.434
How would it feel
if you didn't barge in this time?

16:58.517 --> 17:00.644
Just walk in the room
like you own the place.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.730
You're calm, you're controlled.

17:03.439 --> 17:06.442
And maybe don't slam the memo down.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.404
Just toss it. Throw him off balance. Okay?

17:16.076 --> 17:17.119
Action!

17:27.880 --> 17:30.841
So I got to cut my best actress
from the picture, huh?

17:32.885 --> 17:33.761
Well, guess what?

17:35.054 --> 17:35.971
I'm not doing it.

17:37.431 --> 17:38.474
[chuckling] That's it.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.561
Now, light your cigarette.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.354
Cool as a cucumber.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.072
[Ellen] Mm-hmm.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.327
That's it.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.081
[stammers] Good.

18:02.664 --> 18:05.000
Okay. So let's, uh, move ahead.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.087
Mr. Selzman, the Hays Code isn't optional,

18:08.170 --> 18:11.256
and your picture is rife
with homosexual innuendo.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.176
-Listen to you.
-We're not the censors, Daryl.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.095
We're what's keeping the censors

18:16.178 --> 18:18.972
from destroying the freedom of expression
in this industry.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.975
Here's what I can't stand
about you fellas.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.394
Standing on high with your Hays Code

18:24.978 --> 18:27.689
and telling me, Daryl B. Selzman,

18:27.773 --> 18:30.234
what people in this country should be
allowed to see?

18:30.317 --> 18:31.235
Why?

18:31.485 --> 18:33.987
Because you don't trust people
to make up their own minds.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.531
You don't love our freedom.

18:35.864 --> 18:36.698
You're scared of it!

18:36.782 --> 18:37.991
[dramatic music playing]

18:38.575 --> 18:41.286
People don't like my movies,
they can stand up and walk out,

18:41.370 --> 18:42.454
that's their right.

18:42.538 --> 18:46.041
And I have a right
to lose my shirt doing it.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.292
But this movie...

18:48.043 --> 18:48.961
is a hit.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.004
And Meg Ennis?

18:52.422 --> 18:54.174
That girl is a star.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.970
And if I cut her from my movie,
it'll kill her.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.055
[laughing]

19:00.222 --> 19:03.058
You can scream all you want to,
Mr. Selzman,

19:03.142 --> 19:04.893
but you are cutting those scenes,

19:04.977 --> 19:06.687
or we'll shut down your studio.

19:07.604 --> 19:09.565
That's all there is to it.

19:10.858 --> 19:11.900
Go ahead and try.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.403
We'll do it, Mr. Selzman!

19:15.237 --> 19:16.572
I'll run you out of town.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.448
Oh, yeah?

19:21.410 --> 19:22.744
I <i>am</i> this town.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.164
[music crescendos]

19:30.669 --> 19:33.172
Bartender, another one of these.

19:33.630 --> 19:34.798
Coming right up.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.676
Sarah, thank God. Have you seen Meg?

19:37.759 --> 19:40.971
I-- I had to tell her some sorry news,
and she went out to get some air

19:41.054 --> 19:42.848
and that was...
God, that was hours ago.

19:42.931 --> 19:46.018
Why yes, yes I did.
Meg came over to my apartment,

19:46.101 --> 19:47.519
said she wanted to come here.

19:47.603 --> 19:52.357
She said, "I think I know now what
my life's going to add up to, Sarah."

19:52.441 --> 19:55.402
That's why I didn't think it would be
so bad if she had a drink or--

19:55.485 --> 19:57.237
-[fist pounds]
-Damn it, Sarah! Where is she?

19:57.321 --> 20:00.365
She got cut from the film.
Selzman told me, so I told her and...

20:01.325 --> 20:04.661
Well, now I gotta tell her something else,
before she goes and does something rash.

20:04.745 --> 20:08.498
She had two drinks and left,
said there was something she had to go do.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.335
-I assumed she was meeting you.
-Sorry to interrupt,

20:11.710 --> 20:14.796
but when your friend left, she asked me
how to get to the Hollywoodland sign.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.591
Oh, God.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.092
[Claire] What?

20:19.176 --> 20:20.093
He left.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.808
[tires screeching]

20:27.059 --> 20:29.061
[suspenseful music playing]

20:29.144 --> 20:29.978
[tires screech]

20:30.062 --> 20:31.897

[panting]

20:47.204 --> 20:49.206
[music intensifying]

20:59.466 --> 21:00.300
Meg!

21:04.721 --> 21:05.681
Meg!

21:13.730 --> 21:15.732
[wind howling]

21:28.620 --> 21:30.038
[Jack] Meg! Meg!

21:30.372 --> 21:33.375
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Don't do it, Meg! Please!

21:33.458 --> 21:35.294
Oh, God. Oh, dear God.
Please Meg, don't do it.

21:35.377 --> 21:36.753
Come down, I gotta tell you something.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.130
But I have to do it, Sam.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.423
[Jack] Oh, God!

21:39.506 --> 21:41.341
No, please don't. Oh, God. Meg, please!

21:41.425 --> 21:42.926
[shouting]

21:43.468 --> 21:44.594
No!

21:44.678 --> 21:45.679
Meg!

21:45.762 --> 21:46.596
[gasps softly]

21:49.016 --> 21:51.393
[sobbing] Sam, I'm so scared.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.812
I know you are, I know you are,
but you don't have to be.

21:53.895 --> 21:54.896
You can come down. Please!

21:54.980 --> 21:56.857
What are they going to say about me, Sam?

21:57.441 --> 21:59.359
I'll just be that girl who never made it.

21:59.443 --> 22:02.446
What does it matter what they say?
Listen to what I'm saying. Sweetheart...

22:02.529 --> 22:03.655
Sweetheart, I love you.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.366
Oh, God, I love you
more than anything in the world.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.661
You are a star, Meg.
You're a star, no matter what happens.

22:10.579 --> 22:11.663
You're my star.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.709
Please. Oh, God, please come down
off of that sign...

22:18.003 --> 22:20.088
and be the only star in my sky.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.257
Oh, Sam.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.595
Oh, God, Meg.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.722
Be careful. Be careful, Meg. I'm coming.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.932
I got you. Watch your step.

22:32.059 --> 22:34.519
Come on. Come on, sweetheart.
I got you. I'm here.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.938
I'm here, I got you. Come here.

22:38.231 --> 22:39.066
That's right.

22:39.649 --> 22:40.901
[Jack sighs in relief]

22:41.026 --> 22:42.944
Oh, Meg, you gave me such a fright.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.280
Meg, the way you felt tonight,

22:46.031 --> 22:48.784
I'm never gonna let you feel that way
again, you understand me?

22:51.078 --> 22:52.287
[crying]

22:56.416 --> 22:57.250
I'm sorry.

22:57.626 --> 22:58.460
Goddamn it.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.629
I wasn't supposed to do that.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.632
-Do what?
-Can we cut?

23:04.466 --> 23:05.675
What's he doing? This is great.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.053
I'm not supposed to be crying.
I don't know, I'm sorry.

23:08.136 --> 23:09.471
-Cut!
-[stage bell rings]

23:09.554 --> 23:10.472
[man] Cut.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.850
-Jack, that was beautiful.
-What the hell'd you stop for?

23:13.934 --> 23:14.935
We were really getting it.

23:15.018 --> 23:16.061
That was incredible.

23:17.312 --> 23:20.482
Really? Oh, gosh. I'm sor--
Should we just go right back into it?

23:20.565 --> 23:22.776
Yes, please. All right, everybody,
let's do a pickup!

23:22.859 --> 23:24.861
-Roll sound!
-[crewman] Roll sound.

23:24.945 --> 23:27.781
-[Jack] Sorry!
-[Raymond] It's all right. Roll camera.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.074
[crewman] Roll camera.

23:29.616 --> 23:30.450
And...

23:31.576 --> 23:32.411
action!

23:32.994 --> 23:34.371
[shuddering breath]

23:34.830 --> 23:35.997
I spoke with Selzman.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.542
He's not cutting you out of the picture.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.460
You're going to be in the movie, Meg.

23:41.545 --> 23:42.754
Why didn't you tell me?

23:43.547 --> 23:44.714
When I was about to jump...

23:45.215 --> 23:47.134
I didn't want that to be the thing
that saved you.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.928
I knew you could save yourself.

23:53.056 --> 23:55.058
[uplifting music playing]

24:00.814 --> 24:01.690
Let's get out of here.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.526
We have a whole life to live.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.585
[reel clicking]

24:24.921 --> 24:26.465
[Henry sighs]

24:26.965 --> 24:27.799
I don't know.

24:28.925 --> 24:29.801
Don't know what?

24:31.887 --> 24:33.096
Here I am, right?

24:33.180 --> 24:36.808
I'm sitting here and I'm watching this
for, what, the tenth time?

24:37.642 --> 24:38.477
I just...

24:39.728 --> 24:41.104
I think it's missing something.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.106
And, uh...

24:44.941 --> 24:47.652
what exactly do you think it's missing?

24:47.736 --> 24:49.196
Something bold.

24:49.613 --> 24:52.199
You know, something...
Something surprising!

24:56.203 --> 24:57.037
Here it is.

24:58.288 --> 24:59.247
This is what it needs.

25:01.124 --> 25:04.419
She takes a swan dive off of that sign

25:05.045 --> 25:07.881
and lands directly into a swimming pool.

25:08.006 --> 25:11.635
Suddenly, it's a big Esther Williams
musical number.

25:11.718 --> 25:14.679
I don't know if our girl can swim,
but the audience...

25:14.763 --> 25:17.766
The audience is saying,
"What the hell just happened?

25:17.849 --> 25:19.392
Well, yeah, but did she do it?

25:19.476 --> 25:20.685
Is she in heaven?"

25:21.102 --> 25:23.313
Smash to black, music plays, the end.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.233
That's exciting.
Never seen that before, have you?

25:32.447 --> 25:34.366
-Can I say something?
-Sure.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.619
I've been an editor since...

25:37.702 --> 25:39.579
-the silents, okay?
-Oh, shit.

25:39.663 --> 25:42.374
-I've been doing this for 40 years.
-Goddamn.

25:42.457 --> 25:46.628
I fucked Gloria Swanson
in this very room, Henry.

25:47.212 --> 25:51.841
And I just got to say, of all
the creatives I've ever worked with,

25:52.300 --> 25:54.094
you... [chuckling]

25:54.261 --> 25:56.680
...have the worst ideas.

25:56.763 --> 26:01.017
Get the fuck out of here and let this kid
make his fucking movie, okay?

26:01.101 --> 26:02.227
Fuck you, Harry.

26:03.311 --> 26:06.064
-I'll get you kicked off this picture.
-No, you won't. Fuck you.

26:06.147 --> 26:07.983
I'm gonna go talk to Dick right now.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.068
Then I'm going to start writing
that musical number.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.695
For once in my life, I'm the boss,

26:11.778 --> 26:14.197
and I'm gonna get final cut
on this motherfucker.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.158
[chuckles]

26:18.076 --> 26:19.244
[sighs]

26:21.955 --> 26:22.831
Thanks for that.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.833
It was a pleasure.

26:25.292 --> 26:26.251
[laughing]

26:26.668 --> 26:29.588
That guy has no right
to fuck with your picture.

26:31.214 --> 26:32.257
It's good, kid.

26:33.049 --> 26:34.175
And I mean it.

26:34.718 --> 26:35.594
I like...

26:36.761 --> 26:37.887
what it says.

26:39.306 --> 26:42.100
[stuttering]
Let's run it down one more time.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.519
One more time, please.

26:48.189 --> 26:50.191
[reel clicking]

26:50.984 --> 26:52.986
[big band music playing]

26:54.154 --> 26:55.196
[beeps]

26:55.905 --> 26:57.907
[respirator hissing]

27:21.222 --> 27:22.098
Hello?

27:26.394 --> 27:27.228
Archie?

27:28.813 --> 27:30.940
What's going on? What is this place?

27:32.025 --> 27:33.860
I saw the first cut of the picture.

27:34.527 --> 27:35.862
Oh, God...

27:36.571 --> 27:38.031
They cut me out, didn't they?

27:40.450 --> 27:42.243
-No, you're in it.
-[cork pops]

27:43.036 --> 27:44.371
And you are really,

27:45.121 --> 27:46.414
really good.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.000
I am so,

27:49.459 --> 27:50.585
so proud of you.

27:51.044 --> 27:55.590
I feel like you and me,
we are on the verge of something amazing.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.425
[clinks]

27:58.760 --> 27:59.719
Mmm.

28:00.970 --> 28:01.888
And...

28:03.390 --> 28:04.808
this is my way of saying thank you.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.776
A while ago,
you asked me to be your boyfriend,

28:15.443 --> 28:16.444
and I said no.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.531
Because I couldn't see a future for us.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.909
But watching my movie get made...

28:24.744 --> 28:26.663
I realized ain't nothing impossible.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.216
It's a key to this apartment.

28:40.301 --> 28:41.177
So...

28:43.138 --> 28:44.681
this place is mine?

28:45.306 --> 28:46.516
It's ours.

28:48.309 --> 28:49.686
I'm in love with you, Rock.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.439
I want to live together, and...

28:53.064 --> 28:54.899
I want to be your boyfriend.

29:02.949 --> 29:04.284
[chuckling]

29:04.826 --> 29:06.369
This is real? [chuckles]

29:06.453 --> 29:07.370
Yes.

29:08.830 --> 29:09.998
Welcome home.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.759
[Jack] Every time I closed my eyes,
I was seeing those babies.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.093
I've lost so much.

29:22.677 --> 29:23.636
Sorry, I'm...

29:24.429 --> 29:27.974
I'm just all worked up.
I don't know why I can't just settle down.

29:28.057 --> 29:30.059
Don't you apologize.

29:33.563 --> 29:34.731
Jack, it's all right.

29:37.650 --> 29:39.277
I knew you were the right person to call.

29:42.447 --> 29:45.033
You've been a really good friend to me,
Claire, you know that?

29:45.158 --> 29:47.160
Maybe you don't know that,
but you really have.

29:48.661 --> 29:49.537
You really have.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.874
I love the fellas, but I don't know if...

29:53.333 --> 29:55.210
I don't know if I wanted to cry
in front of them.

29:56.753 --> 29:59.339
It's okay to be emotional
when you lose something, Jack.

29:59.422 --> 30:00.840
[crying]

30:01.216 --> 30:04.052
I was a mess when my father was
in the hospital.

30:04.135 --> 30:06.429
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

30:06.513 --> 30:07.889
Don't... Don't be sorry.

30:11.059 --> 30:11.893
You have...

30:14.854 --> 30:17.273
You have-- you have so much
to look forward to.

30:18.775 --> 30:21.611
A few months ago,
you were a contract player, and now...

30:22.195 --> 30:24.864
you're a part of an incredible ensemble
of artists,

30:24.948 --> 30:28.743
who aren't just making a movie,
they're making history.

30:31.204 --> 30:33.540
Remember when I told you
you were gonna be a star?

30:34.332 --> 30:35.750
[chuckles]

30:36.417 --> 30:37.335
Yeah, I do.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.881
You're gonna be a star.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.139
Have you thought about...

30:51.432 --> 30:53.184
who you're gonna take to the premiere?

30:53.268 --> 30:55.353
-Gosh, I forgot about that.
-[clears throat]

30:55.436 --> 30:57.188
Do you know who you're gonna bring?

31:02.068 --> 31:02.944
Well, I was...

31:05.822 --> 31:07.115
I was hoping...

31:09.993 --> 31:11.494
I was hoping it would be you.

31:14.831 --> 31:15.665
Me?

31:20.420 --> 31:21.337
You wanna go with me?

31:24.090 --> 31:25.258
Absolutely.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.011
You mean go together? I would love to.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.137
-Really?
-Are you kidding?

31:29.220 --> 31:30.930
Yeah, that... that'd be wonderful.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.473
[both chuckling]

31:33.808 --> 31:34.976
[Claire] Okay.

31:36.936 --> 31:38.229
All right, good.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.023
Good.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.986
[crowd cheering]

31:45.403 --> 31:46.654
Oh, this...

31:46.738 --> 31:47.739
Oh, my...

31:47.822 --> 31:48.698
Wow!

31:48.781 --> 31:51.326
Avis, can you believe it?

31:51.784 --> 31:55.830
Oh, I am so happy to be back.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.541
-Oh, look at the--
-You should be pleased.

31:59.292 --> 32:02.170
There hasn't been a crowd this size
since Eleanor Roosevelt.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.546
Wait, what?

32:04.005 --> 32:05.256
[elevator dings]

32:06.507 --> 32:07.383
Avis,

32:07.926 --> 32:09.135
I can't thank you enough

32:09.469 --> 32:11.471
for everything you did while I was away.

32:12.221 --> 32:13.598
You kept this place afloat.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.391
You took some chances.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.687
I can't say I always agreed
with those chances, but, uh, I admire it.

32:20.980 --> 32:23.274
-I'm very proud of you.
-Thank you, darling.

32:23.900 --> 32:27.362
Green-lighting <i>Meg </i>was a difficult
decision, but it was the right one.

32:27.612 --> 32:28.821
I've seen the rushes.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.698
The film is magnificent.

32:31.532 --> 32:33.576
-Good morning.
-Miss Stinson.

32:36.704 --> 32:38.957
How many times do I have to fire you?

32:39.040 --> 32:41.626
Hello, Mrs. Amberg. Ace asked me here.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.712
Avis, uh...

32:45.546 --> 32:47.340
I'm just going to talk
to the boys for a bit.

32:47.423 --> 32:48.675
Uh, why don't you go home

32:48.758 --> 32:51.052
and, uh, we'll celebrate tonight
over dinner?

32:51.636 --> 32:53.930
But, uh, no roast beef
or anything like that.

32:54.013 --> 32:57.809
I... I'm on this new diet
the doctor's got me on. Just rice.

32:57.892 --> 32:59.978
All I'm allowed to have is white rice

33:00.520 --> 33:01.771
and fruit juice.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.698
All right, gentlemen, let's get to it.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.283
Obviously, I overslept.

33:14.367 --> 33:17.370
-[men laughing]
-[muffled chatter]

33:22.250 --> 33:24.085
Have a good day, Mrs. Amberg.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.172
[dramatic music playing]

33:31.801 --> 33:32.885
[elevator dings]

33:34.971 --> 33:37.473
Avis, we're just going over
a distribution plan for <i>Meg.</i>

33:39.142 --> 33:40.143
Where are you going?

33:41.519 --> 33:42.645
I've been sent home.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.273
To make dinner.

33:48.151 --> 33:51.696
All right, tell me about this bomb
we have, <i>All Hands on Deck.</i>

33:51.779 --> 33:53.364
I like that picture. What happened?

33:53.448 --> 33:56.576
Well, many of our distributors
pulled the film.

33:56.951 --> 33:59.245
They were facing boycotts
when it was announced that

33:59.328 --> 34:01.581
<i>Meg</i> would be starring a colored girl.

34:01.664 --> 34:03.750
Uh, let's talk about this for a second.

34:03.833 --> 34:08.337
A lot of work went into this picture,
and I know it's risky, but I admire that.

34:08.421 --> 34:12.008
So you don't feel that the fag and
the two ladies went behind your back?

34:12.091 --> 34:13.801
-[Ace] The fag?
-Dick Samuels.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.053
Dick Samuels, a fag?

34:15.136 --> 34:16.971
No, what are you talking about?

34:17.055 --> 34:19.932
He's got women hanging all over him.
He's quite the catch.

34:20.016 --> 34:23.895
Well, be that as it may,
while you were indisposed, sir,

34:24.353 --> 34:27.106
the lunatics were very much
taking over the asylum.

34:27.190 --> 34:30.318
If you release this film,
it will destroy the studio

34:30.401 --> 34:33.362
and tarnish the reputation
of every picture you have ever made

34:33.446 --> 34:35.114
or intend to make.
It's just that simple.

34:35.448 --> 34:37.283
Come on. You're overreacting.

34:37.658 --> 34:39.285
Sir, we've done the research.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.829
<i>Meg</i> will not play in the South.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.749
A hundred and twenty-five theaters
have signed a statement

34:44.832 --> 34:46.876
saying they will not run the picture,

34:46.959 --> 34:50.963
nor any subsequent Ace picture,
if Meg is released anywhere.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.507
We'll go bankrupt in six months!

34:52.590 --> 34:54.675
-All right, so what do I do?
-Burn it.

34:56.010 --> 34:58.179
-Burn it?
-Burn every foot of film.

34:58.554 --> 35:01.432
They won't have anything to point to.
They'll call off the dogs.

35:02.016 --> 35:04.936
You'll be back on the throne,
studio remains solvent,

35:05.019 --> 35:06.938
we move forward
like nothing ever happened.

35:23.329 --> 35:24.705
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

35:25.331 --> 35:26.999
<i>We have a whole life to live.</i>

35:45.309 --> 35:47.311
[waiter]
Here you are, Mr. Amberg. Your rice.

35:50.189 --> 35:52.108
[scoffs] I can't eat this shit.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.152
Get me... get me a brisket,

35:54.235 --> 35:56.988
uh, some of those, uh, cheesy potatoes

35:57.071 --> 35:58.990
-and a lemon meringue pie.
-[waiter] Right away.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.492
One meal's not gonna kill me.

36:02.785 --> 36:04.954
All right, before you do anything,

36:05.538 --> 36:06.914
I want you to see the picture.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.167
-I know it is not your taste--
-I saw it.

36:10.918 --> 36:14.005
-It's great.
-Fantastic. So you're going to release it.

36:14.589 --> 36:15.464
Well, I...

36:15.715 --> 36:17.383
I haven't made up my mind yet.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.057
All right,

36:25.516 --> 36:26.601
let me help you.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.646
If you don't release this picture,
I will resign

36:31.606 --> 36:33.357
and I will give an interview

36:33.441 --> 36:35.776
to every journalist who will take my call

36:35.860 --> 36:39.280
and tell them what went down here
and how and why.

36:39.947 --> 36:41.991
I will be kind to Avis.

36:42.074 --> 36:43.659
I will not be kind to you.

36:43.993 --> 36:46.954
-After all I've done for you?
-Fuck off!

36:47.538 --> 36:48.998
"After all I've done for you."

36:49.081 --> 36:52.877
What have you done for me, except take
every ounce of credit for my work?

36:52.960 --> 36:56.297
You never trusted me,
you never listened to a thing I said.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.673
I defended you!

36:57.757 --> 37:00.676
I defended you
when everybody was calling you a fag.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.969
[Dick scoffing] Really?

37:02.053 --> 37:02.970
How noble.

37:06.015 --> 37:07.642
Well, guess what, Ace?

37:09.227 --> 37:10.728
I am a fag.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.275
I just... I hid it all these years
because I was afraid.

37:16.359 --> 37:18.402
I am not afraid anymore.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.029
I've met someone.

37:21.155 --> 37:21.989
I love him,

37:22.740 --> 37:24.492
and I'm happy for the first time.

37:27.119 --> 37:27.954
Dick...

37:28.037 --> 37:30.790
I'm going to be in your office
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow,

37:30.873 --> 37:32.959
letter of resignation in hand.

37:35.544 --> 37:38.464
You release <i>Meg,</i>
you might bankrupt the studio.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.508
You pull it, I'm coming after you.

37:43.886 --> 37:45.429
[Avis] <i>I spoke to your doctor.</i>

37:45.513 --> 37:47.556
He said you could have cauliflower too,

37:47.640 --> 37:49.475
so long as I make sure it's steamed.

37:49.558 --> 37:52.561
Oh, Avis, steamed cauliflower?
I can't eat this!

37:52.645 --> 37:54.647
-I'll shit the bed!
-So shit the bed.

37:54.897 --> 37:57.024
You're gonna eat it, goddamn it.
Gertie, put it down.

37:58.234 --> 38:00.611
Yesterday, I ran a movie studio.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.029
I had power.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.573
But today, I'm a housewife again.

38:05.032 --> 38:08.577
So if keeping your fat ass alive
is my job now,

38:09.161 --> 38:10.121
I'm gonna do it.

38:10.204 --> 38:12.456
Okay, fine. You want me to eat this?

38:12.623 --> 38:14.166
-I'll eat it.
-Good.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.295
Nope, I'm not going to do it!

38:17.503 --> 38:19.880
-What? What?
-I'm not going to get a taste

38:19.964 --> 38:22.466
for what it feels like being in charge,

38:23.050 --> 38:25.678
having autonomy for the first time
in my life,

38:25.761 --> 38:28.055
and then being pushed back
into the kitchen.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.098
I won't do it.

38:29.265 --> 38:30.349
I can't!

38:30.433 --> 38:32.643
My head is exploding.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.438
What do you want?

38:35.521 --> 38:37.898
I want to co-chair Ace Pictures.

38:40.109 --> 38:42.862
You're recovering
from a major health scare.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.698
Your doctor says
you can only work half days.

38:46.532 --> 38:48.784
Let me carry what you can't.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.956
You won't take anything less?

38:54.457 --> 38:55.499
No, I won't.

39:00.629 --> 39:01.464
Okay.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.007
Okay?

39:04.050 --> 39:04.884
Okay.

39:11.390 --> 39:12.767
I saw <i>Meg</i> today.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.396
And what you did was amazing.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.358
It's a spectacular movie.

39:21.233 --> 39:23.027
It's not the movie I would make, but...

39:23.402 --> 39:25.738
I think that's the point of this, right?

39:28.032 --> 39:30.951
You know, ever since this whole thing
happened to me, I...

39:32.453 --> 39:34.663
I've been thinking differently.

39:35.915 --> 39:37.416
I've been thinking, uh...

39:38.751 --> 39:40.878
How do I want to leave this world?

39:42.129 --> 39:43.089
And...

39:43.839 --> 39:45.633
what I want to leave in it.

39:48.636 --> 39:49.470
And, uh...

39:50.846 --> 39:52.348
I'd have been proud

39:53.140 --> 39:54.683
to have released that movie.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.063
Now, what do you say?

40:03.317 --> 40:04.151
You earned it.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.037
Mmm. I am so sorry.

40:15.121 --> 40:17.623
-I am so, so sorry.
-[weeping]

40:17.706 --> 40:18.791
I'm sorry, too.

40:18.874 --> 40:21.377
I want to make a go of it.
I want to try again.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.922
I think we still have time.

40:27.591 --> 40:30.136
[humming]

40:34.348 --> 40:35.599
[Gertie] Mrs. Amberg...

40:37.226 --> 40:41.188
in 20 years, I've never heard you
singing at the table before.

40:42.231 --> 40:43.315
Well...

40:44.024 --> 40:45.276
I had a good night.

40:45.526 --> 40:46.777
That's all I'll say.

40:47.361 --> 40:49.363
We could hear you. [groans]

40:50.322 --> 40:52.366
Kept me awake until 4:00 a.m.

40:53.492 --> 40:55.995
It was... nauseating.

40:56.078 --> 40:57.496
[laughing]

40:58.080 --> 41:00.291
Gertie, we have a big week
of planning ahead.

41:00.374 --> 41:03.627
Get all the linens out of storage
and call the tent company

41:03.711 --> 41:05.880
because on Saturday we're having a party.

41:07.089 --> 41:11.010
Ace is going to announce he's making me
co-president of the studio.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.429
-What?
-I never thought I'd see the day.

41:13.512 --> 41:16.348
-Neither did I. I keep pinching myself.
-[Claire gasping]

41:16.432 --> 41:20.394
-Mother, that's unbelievable!
-For once, Daddy got something right.

41:23.814 --> 41:26.233
[Claire humming]

41:26.609 --> 41:29.278
Gertie, I want pancakes.

41:30.905 --> 41:33.991
Ace, I have your breakfast.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.329
Ace...

41:40.289 --> 41:42.166
I have something sweet for you.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.379
[sad music playing]

42:23.874 --> 42:25.501
[kisses, inhales sharply]

42:36.136 --> 42:37.471
[reporters overlapping]

42:37.555 --> 42:39.265
[reporter 1] <i>Simply stunning, Miss Lee!</i>

42:39.348 --> 42:41.433
[reporter 2] Hollywood Reporter,
<i>a picture, please?</i>

42:41.517 --> 42:43.519
[cameras bulbs popping]

42:43.602 --> 42:45.396
[reporter 1] <i>Miss Lee, over here!</i>

42:45.479 --> 42:46.981
<i>Let me tell you something, Meg.</i>

42:48.315 --> 42:49.358
<i>All this...</i>

42:50.818 --> 42:54.280
<i>the photos, the red carpet,</i>
<i>the parties, the stardom...</i>

42:55.948 --> 42:57.783
<i>it's all smoke and mirrors.</i>

42:59.493 --> 43:01.745
<i>None of it is worth a fig, do you hear me?</i>

43:02.246 --> 43:03.706
<i>I'm telling you now,</i>

43:04.623 --> 43:06.625
<i>this will all be yours very soon.</i>

43:06.709 --> 43:09.837
<i>-But if you're not--</i>
-Boring. Cut this scene.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.630
[reel sputtering]

43:12.006 --> 43:13.257
I said turn it off.

43:13.340 --> 43:16.051
-Sorry, Mr. Willson, just a sec.
-Jesus Christ.

43:16.135 --> 43:18.721
This is what you get when you hire
an editor on looks alone.

43:18.804 --> 43:20.389
I'm new, I don't know this equipment.

43:21.056 --> 43:24.268
Thank you. You know what?
Skip to the last reel.

43:24.351 --> 43:27.062
There is something about that ending
that I just don't buy.

43:32.901 --> 43:34.903
[lounge music playing]

43:37.281 --> 43:40.701
Bartender, can you tell me how to get up
to the Hollywoodland sign?

43:43.829 --> 43:46.582
You head up Beachwood Drive
and you'll see the trailhead right there.

43:46.665 --> 43:48.667
[Henry] Freeze it. Freeze it right there.

43:55.758 --> 43:56.800
You're not saying anything.

43:57.926 --> 43:59.803
It's called "thinking," Randy.

44:01.013 --> 44:02.806
See, this is why the picture doesn't work.

44:03.307 --> 44:06.060
This is the part where she decides
to jump off the sign, right?

44:07.019 --> 44:09.813
Well, I still don't feel like I understand
why she wants to kill herself.

44:11.106 --> 44:12.483
Well, she got cut out of the movie.

44:13.609 --> 44:16.612
[sighs] Yes, I know, dumbshit.
That's the problem.

44:16.695 --> 44:18.906
You think America's gonna
like this girl for ending it all

44:18.989 --> 44:20.282
'cause she got cut out of a film?

44:20.366 --> 44:22.493
John and Jane Q. Public,
they've never been in a film,

44:22.576 --> 44:23.911
they're not killing themselves.

44:23.994 --> 44:26.872
I guess it's because she staked
her whole life on this thing.

44:27.623 --> 44:29.541
A thing that most people don't care about.

44:30.042 --> 44:31.043
She does.

44:32.252 --> 44:33.671
She built her whole world around it.

44:34.546 --> 44:35.464
That's her flaw.

44:36.423 --> 44:38.258
Well, well, well,

44:38.717 --> 44:41.929
listen to what just shot out of that
tiny pea brain of yours.

44:42.012 --> 44:43.972
<i>That's </i>what this movie needs!

44:44.056 --> 44:46.517
Right after this scene, it's just...
it's a moment...

44:46.600 --> 44:48.602
It can be her alone where she realizes...

44:48.727 --> 44:50.312
where she says to herself,

44:50.396 --> 44:53.440
"I fucked up my whole life
needing this thing."

44:53.816 --> 44:55.526
That's why she kills herself.

44:58.028 --> 44:59.238
But we don't have that scene.

44:59.321 --> 45:00.364
We'll do a reshoot.

45:00.447 --> 45:02.700
It's half a day's work,
it's one scene. I'll talk to Dick.

45:02.783 --> 45:03.617
What the fuck?

45:05.411 --> 45:06.829
Who the fuck is he?

45:06.912 --> 45:08.622
Well, hello, you old piece of shit.

45:08.706 --> 45:10.958
He's the new editor,
'cause I fired your ass.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.209
What's going on in here?

45:12.835 --> 45:14.586
Willson, what are you doing?

45:15.045 --> 45:18.841
This stupid fuck
is recutting your picture.

45:18.924 --> 45:20.509
No, I am saving your picture.

45:20.592 --> 45:23.721
I <i>am</i> cutting that God-awful
Anna May Wong red carpet scene.

45:23.804 --> 45:24.847
The hell you are!

45:24.930 --> 45:27.057
There's an entire scene missing
in the final reel.

45:27.141 --> 45:28.517
It's why the ending doesn't work.

45:28.600 --> 45:31.603
We need a quiet scene with Meg,
alone,

45:31.687 --> 45:33.772
where we understand
why she wants to kill herself.

45:33.856 --> 45:36.316
Right now, it's because
she got cut out of a movie.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.777
The audience needs to know
it's deeper than that.

45:39.361 --> 45:42.698
She staked her whole life on this dream,
and it's over now.

45:42.948 --> 45:45.200
It's one scene.
We can pick it up in one night.

45:47.828 --> 45:49.246
That's actually a good idea.

45:51.498 --> 45:52.875
Why don't you take it up with Dick?

45:52.958 --> 45:54.710
Fuck Dick and his fancy five-dollar words.

45:54.793 --> 45:56.628
Dick thinks he's smarter than me.
He's not.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.380
-I'll get the new scene shot.
-You!

45:58.464 --> 45:59.715
Step away from that machine.

46:00.507 --> 46:01.341
Come on.

46:01.842 --> 46:02.760
Hey-- hey!

46:02.885 --> 46:03.927
What's the big idea?

46:04.011 --> 46:05.220
What the hell are you doing?

46:05.304 --> 46:08.140
No need to worry. We're just taking
all the footage for safekeeping.

46:08.223 --> 46:09.725
-You can't do that.
-Yes we can, son.

46:09.808 --> 46:13.270
Get your hands off. Wait just a minute.
That's my film, you can't touch that.

46:13.353 --> 46:16.231
Get your hands off-- Hey!
You can't do this! What are you--

46:16.315 --> 46:18.442
Somebody get Ace Amberg on the phone.
You can't do this!

46:18.525 --> 46:21.111
Go ahead and call him.
Ace Amberg is dead.

47:01.693 --> 47:03.695
[big band music playing]
