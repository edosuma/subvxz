01:14.674 --> 01:16.702
I'll be there.

02:31.785 --> 02:35.422
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven,</i>

02:35.522 --> 02:38.359
<i>six, five, four,</i>

02:38.459 --> 02:41.162
<i>three, two, one,</i>

02:41.262 --> 02:42.964
<i>zero.</i>

02:43.664 --> 02:47.635
I know I don't have to tell you this,
but we need a good one tonight.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.734
More than ever.

02:50.236 --> 02:53.307
Rick Gabler from Decca
is supposed to show up.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.776
This could be our chance
to be signed by a big label.

02:56.276 --> 02:59.513
This is going to be our kind of audience.
So let's give them what they want.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.115
All right.

03:01.215 --> 03:05.132
And Glen, if you could try not to...

03:05.232 --> 03:08.322
touch yourself while you're singing,
that would be great.

03:08.422 --> 03:11.358
What? But it's my signature move, Jonny.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.052
You know it.

03:14.460 --> 03:17.698
Honestly, mate, it makes everyone
feel sick. Please don't do it.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.293
They love it, Jonny!

03:21.233 --> 03:25.072
You like it, really.
That's worth more than music, actually.

03:25.472 --> 03:29.376
This is our fucking day.
Let's give 100% out there.

03:29.476 --> 03:32.071
All right, let's do this!

03:36.546 --> 03:38.477
Give us a kiss.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.124
Look, Paul, I know I said two weeks,

03:43.224 --> 03:46.727
but I'm telling you,
this band is on the verge.

03:46.827 --> 03:50.231
After tonight's gig, the money
is going to start pouring in.

03:50.331 --> 03:55.068
No, I'm not a thief.
I just need a little bit more time.

03:55.168 --> 03:58.339
In my flat? To cut my hands off?

03:58.439 --> 04:00.366
My balls?

04:01.574 --> 04:04.603
Yeah. Yeah.

04:11.384 --> 04:15.328
<i>We are the Yellow Blackguards
and we bring you love!</i>

04:15.428 --> 04:18.149
<i>Fucking cunty bastards!</i>

04:19.392 --> 04:21.206
<i>Jonny!</i>

04:25.631 --> 04:27.426
Shit!

04:28.334 --> 04:30.229
Jonny!

05:16.883 --> 05:21.138
How was I to know they randomly changed
hippie night into inbred retard night?

05:21.238 --> 05:25.609
You're our manager. You're supposed
to fucking know these things.

05:25.709 --> 05:27.661
I mean, seriously, Jonny.
This can't go on, mate.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.464
- What can't go on?
- This, you know.

05:30.564 --> 05:34.735
You promising to deliver and us somehow
always ending up in the shitter.

05:34.835 --> 05:39.306
- Having to run for our lives.
- You can't possibly blame me for this.

05:39.406 --> 05:43.710
All right, it's not just this.
It's... actually, it's everything.

05:43.810 --> 05:48.349
Like... example. How long have you been
saying that we're going to do my rock opera?

05:48.449 --> 05:51.352
- Because I don't see no rock opera.
- I'm working on it.

05:51.452 --> 05:56.156
What else? All right. We've been gigging for
three years and I'm still not getting laid.

05:56.256 --> 05:59.043
And that's what it's all about for you,
isn't it, Glen? Getting laid.

05:59.143 --> 06:02.663
Partly. Yes.
I'm the lead singer in a band.

06:02.763 --> 06:06.834
I write all these fucking
amazing poetic lyrics as well.

06:06.934 --> 06:10.404
"You're off, Henry", "Grandma's nipples",

06:10.504 --> 06:13.707
"Take me to the zoo",
"I fancy that rhino".

06:13.807 --> 06:17.344
Look, I'm sorry, Jonny, but we're
going to need another manager.

06:17.444 --> 06:19.813
What? That's ridiculous.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.775
How is it going to work with two managers?

06:25.051 --> 06:29.623
No, not like another manager,
like a different one.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.192
But that's insane.
I'm just about to get you signed.

06:32.292 --> 06:35.796
And all I'm asking for...
is two more days to sort it out.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.765
Okay.

06:38.465 --> 06:42.019
Fine. Two days.
But then we are fucking out of here.

06:42.119 --> 06:44.781
Our luck is going to change. You'll see.

06:55.381 --> 06:58.010
Oh, for fuck's sake, Jonny!

07:00.686 --> 07:03.524
<i>I believe that this nation
should commit itself</i>

07:03.624 --> 07:07.628
<i>to achieving the goal,
before this decade is out,</i>

07:07.728 --> 07:12.032
- <i>of landing a man on the moon...</i>
- Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.051
Bullshit.

07:14.151 --> 07:15.979
As you know...

07:16.079 --> 07:18.839
we've been developing
our space program for some time now,

07:18.939 --> 07:23.110
planning our 11th Apollo mission
to the moon in 10 days' time.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.279
The trouble is...

07:25.739 --> 07:28.549
we still don't have a clue whether
the thing's going to make it or not.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.652
It's been made only too clear
to me that this is our last shot.

07:31.752 --> 07:36.457
And that means the Russians will have
a clear run to get to the moon first.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.828
And do you know what happens if the Russians
happen to make it to the moon first?

07:40.928 --> 07:44.623
We're going to wind up looking
like a bunch of dicks, that's what.

07:47.199 --> 07:50.771
You ever seen a movie called
<i>2001: A space odyssey</i> ?

07:50.871 --> 07:53.897
Made by this film director geek
called Stanley Kubrick.

07:53.997 --> 07:55.976
All set in space and shit.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.445
Doesn't make a goddamn bit
of sense, but it looks terrific.

07:58.545 --> 08:02.483
Now, the thing we've been
asking ourselves is this.

08:02.583 --> 08:06.820
If we've got a guy that can make things
look like they're on the moon,

08:06.920 --> 08:09.623
then doesn't it make sense to...

08:09.723 --> 08:13.160
you know, film a pretend moon landing?

08:13.260 --> 08:15.662
Just in case the real one doesn't work.

08:15.762 --> 08:18.515
We send Apollo into space.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.001
If they land...

08:21.351 --> 08:23.186
great.

08:23.286 --> 08:26.389
If not, we let them circle around the moon

08:26.489 --> 08:28.875
while we broadcast Kubrick's images.

08:28.975 --> 08:30.477
Okay, so, here's the plan.

08:30.577 --> 08:34.815
We've set up a little meeting for you
in London with Stanley Kubrick's agent.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.984
He's expected to meet with a Hollywood
producer who has an important project

08:38.083 --> 08:40.621
for his client. Meet with Kubrick.
Convince him.

08:40.721 --> 08:44.801
There's enough money in this briefcase
to turn anyone into a patriot.

08:46.726 --> 08:49.764
- You don't look happy.
- The thing is, sir...

08:50.964 --> 08:57.004
I just... spent the last three years
in special operations in Vietnam.

08:57.104 --> 09:01.976
I was led to believe
that I would be given leave.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.479
Look, I get it. Who wants to go to London,

09:05.579 --> 09:08.148
be surrounded by a bunch
of hippies and homosexuals?

09:08.248 --> 09:10.784
But the thing you have to know is this,

09:10.884 --> 09:13.386
not all Englishmen are actually queer.

09:13.486 --> 09:17.891
They just look and act queer.
So, you don't have to worry about that.

09:17.991 --> 09:21.220
- Any other questions?
- Yes, sir.

09:22.698 --> 09:25.987
It sounds like a rather large operation.
How are we going to keep this secret?

09:26.567 --> 09:28.892
We'll do what the Egyptians did.

09:28.992 --> 09:31.672
Bury the architects inside the pyramid.

09:31.772 --> 09:36.010
- The architects?
- The architects. It's a metaphor.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.871
Oh, right.

09:43.215 --> 09:45.211
So you want me to kill everyone.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.654
Oh, fuck.

10:06.872 --> 10:09.301
Jimi fucking Hendrix.

10:12.211 --> 10:14.306
Fucking shit.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.511
You all right, Jonny?

10:35.701 --> 10:37.904
Did you do that?

10:38.313 --> 10:39.406
What do you think?

10:39.506 --> 10:41.842
The guy looks like you, though.
Doesn't he?

10:41.942 --> 10:45.492
Of course it looks like me. That's me
if I don't pay back the Ironmonger.

10:45.592 --> 10:49.299
The Ironmonger?
Are you mad in the head, Jonny?

10:49.399 --> 10:52.219
He chops people's willies off
with rusty tools.

10:52.319 --> 10:57.124
- That could be you, your Willy.
- I know that, Leon.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.576
I needed the money for the band.

10:59.676 --> 11:02.896
I just got to get them signed,
then I can pay back the Ironmonger.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.198
Then everything will be fine again.

11:05.298 --> 11:09.121
Well, you know, on the bright side,
it couldn't get much worse.

11:09.221 --> 11:12.572
- Yeah, all right, Leon.
- I mean, you've barely got a pot to piss in.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.108
If you lose the band,
you'll be back on the breadlines.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.936
All right, Leon. For fuck's sake.

11:23.015 --> 11:27.019
I'm going to go see Derek Kaye.
He's the one man that can help me.

11:28.921 --> 11:32.690
Hey! How's this place got all messy?

11:34.460 --> 11:36.997
So, I said to her, I said...

11:37.097 --> 11:40.967
I said, get your pussy
out of my Aston Martin

11:41.067 --> 11:43.295
before I kick it out.

11:46.238 --> 11:48.600
Kick it out.

11:55.347 --> 11:58.310
You're an American, aren't you?

11:59.852 --> 12:03.984
An American. A yankee.

12:04.603 --> 12:07.230
<i>Yankee Doodle went to town</i>

12:07.330 --> 12:09.582
<i>Riding on a pony</i>

12:09.682 --> 12:14.120
<i>Stuck a feather in his ass
And called it macaroni</i>

12:14.220 --> 12:17.173
<i>Yankee Doodle Dandy
Yankee Doodle went to town</i>

12:18.606 --> 12:24.210
- I'm so sorry. I'm so clumsy, mumsy me.
- Jesus Christ. No, no, please. Please.

12:24.310 --> 12:27.472
- Oh, no. We need napkins!
- Please.

12:41.443 --> 12:45.932
No, look, listen, we can talk about this
when the money's right. Because other...

12:46.832 --> 12:49.962
Oh, yeah. I'll call you back.

12:53.672 --> 12:55.858
- Hi, Derek.
- What are you doing here?

12:55.958 --> 12:59.179
- Can I talk to you? I just need two minutes.
- Right. Two minutes, that's it.

12:59.279 --> 13:03.694
I've got an important meeting
in five minutes. Just be quick.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.053
- You've done well for yourself.
- Yeah.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.589
- Good clients.
- Well, you could do all right, too.

13:09.689 --> 13:13.460
You just got to try not to fuck
everything up all the time.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.263
Yeah, that's good advice.

13:16.363 --> 13:19.866
So, how's your dad's butcher business?

13:19.966 --> 13:21.834
You working for him yet?

13:21.934 --> 13:26.707
No. No, I'm not. It's my band,
you know, they're really going places.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.590
You should hear the new set.

13:28.690 --> 13:31.511
They're sounding tight.
Last night was amazing.

13:31.611 --> 13:35.215
The girls were throwing their knickers
on the stage and everything.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.683
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

13:36.783 --> 13:40.020
All we need now is a... record deal.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.848
I thought maybe you could help.

13:46.993 --> 13:52.933
What? Sorry, why would I risk my reputation
associating myself with you?

13:53.033 --> 13:57.621
All I'm asking for is an in. You know,
you could introduce me to the right people.

13:57.721 --> 14:00.741
Yeah, I could. But I'm not going to.

14:00.941 --> 14:05.245
- Come on, mate. We're cousins.
- What that's got to do with anything?

14:05.345 --> 14:11.151
Look, I've got to trust the people that
I work with. Frankly, I don't trust you.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.720
- So, what are you saying?
- I think you're a mess, Jonny.

14:13.820 --> 14:17.216
You're disorganized, you're ineffective,
you can't deliver.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.785
Anything else?

14:22.027 --> 14:24.089
You dress weird.

14:25.431 --> 14:31.496
- Can you lend me some money then?
- Yeah. Sure. How much do you want?

14:33.572 --> 14:37.169
Oh, thanks, mate. You saved my life.

14:42.747 --> 14:44.394
- Too late.
- Come on, mate.

14:44.494 --> 14:46.904
I only need a few grand. You're loaded.

14:56.828 --> 15:00.350
Oh, you're... you're... you're bleeding.

15:01.367 --> 15:05.238
Fuck! Oh, Jesus! All right. Okay.
That's it. The meeting is over.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.525
- But Derek...
- Just fuck off!

15:09.108 --> 15:12.262
Shit! Jesus!

15:13.012 --> 15:16.634
- Fucking oy!
- Prick.

15:35.834 --> 15:37.654
Fuck.

15:39.805 --> 15:41.792
Derek Kaye?

15:42.142 --> 15:44.194
Tom Kidman.

15:44.776 --> 15:46.413
Johnson Brother films.

15:46.513 --> 15:50.317
I believe you were expecting my visit
regarding Mr. Stanley Kubrick.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.635
Right, yeah. I...

15:52.735 --> 15:55.839
I'll be brief, as I just came
straight from the airport.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.855
As I said to you on the phone,
we have a proposal for Mr. Kubrick

15:58.955 --> 16:00.994
that he needs to take extremely seriously.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.462
Yeah. Cool.

16:02.562 --> 16:05.933
There's a considerable amount
of money in this project.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.169
Should Mr. Kubrick decide to say yes.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.371
For him and for you.

16:11.471 --> 16:15.208
Now, this is a project of extreme
importance to my employers.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.338
And it's incredibly time sensitive.

16:18.678 --> 16:22.452
There's nothing else I can say
without Mr. Kubrick. But...

16:22.952 --> 16:25.217
I'll be available
to discuss this all afternoon.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.320
Here's the number you can reach me at.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.190
If Mr. Kubrick accepts our proposal,

16:30.290 --> 16:32.592
he gets the money.

16:32.692 --> 16:38.648
And I would appreciate it if...
you would keep this strictly confidential.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.138
Leon!

17:02.421 --> 17:04.273
One sec.

17:07.992 --> 17:11.114
How are you, man? What's up?

17:14.199 --> 17:15.768
This is insanity, man.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.871
I look nothing like
Stanley fucking Kubrick.

17:18.070 --> 17:21.641
You'll be fine. You've got a beard.
That's all that matters.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.526
All we've got to do is sit down,

17:23.626 --> 17:26.479
answer a few questions and just act
like you know what you're talking about.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.432
But I don't know what I'm talking about.
He's going to clock it...

17:29.532 --> 17:34.064
Of course he's not. He's some Hollywood
idiot from Hollywood. He's clueless.

17:34.164 --> 17:38.191
All right, wait, wait.
What films did I make again?

17:38.291 --> 17:39.726
- <i>Paths of Glory.</i>
- Yeah.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.127
- <i>Dr. Strangelove.</i>
- Yeah.

17:41.227 --> 17:44.213
- <i>Lolita.</i>
- Wait, hang on.

17:44.313 --> 17:48.218
<i>Lolita?</i> Isn't that the pedo film?

17:48.318 --> 17:52.305
Oh, for fuck's sake, Jonny. No!
Why do I have to be a pedo?

17:52.405 --> 17:56.176
Why can't I be someone else?
Why can't I be Hitchcock?

17:56.276 --> 17:59.496
No! You're Stanley Kubrick.

18:00.646 --> 18:03.550
Listen, I'm not going to let him
fuck me up the arse.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.868
- What are you talking about?
- I hear stories, man.

18:05.968 --> 18:09.389
These Hollywood dudes
are at it all the time.

18:12.224 --> 18:14.494
Oh, fuck.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.830
Oh, shit, I feel sick.
I think I've got stage fright.

18:18.130 --> 18:22.385
Hang on. I need to relax.
Hang on. Hang on.

18:22.901 --> 18:26.313
Leon! Leon! What's in the bag, Leon?

18:26.413 --> 18:28.224
Leon!

18:29.174 --> 18:31.978
It's repair patch glue.

18:32.078 --> 18:35.632
Are you fucking joking me?
You're doing this to me now?

18:37.482 --> 18:41.287
- Wake up, Leon, you fucking junkie!
- I'm sorry.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.240
Look...

18:44.423 --> 18:46.609
Take some of this.

18:49.094 --> 18:51.431
Get more. All of it.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.004
How do you feel now?

18:58.304 --> 19:01.241
Powerful. Like a horse.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.109
Listen. All you've got to do...

19:04.209 --> 19:08.148
is sit in there for five minutes
and pretend to be Stanley Kubrick.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.556
- All right.
- You can do it. I know you can pull it off.

19:10.656 --> 19:12.652
- Yeah. All right. Okay.
- Okay?

19:12.752 --> 19:16.189
- Yeah.
- Okay. How do I look?

19:16.289 --> 19:18.029
Okay. Great.

19:37.476 --> 19:39.462
Shit.

19:40.746 --> 19:43.583
- Good to see you again, Mr. Kidman.
- Good to see you.

19:43.683 --> 19:47.019
Please meet Mr. Stanley Kubrick.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.389
So good of you to see me
on such short notice.

19:49.489 --> 19:52.825
Sorry. My hands are a bit clammy.

19:52.925 --> 19:58.231
- You've got to be an incredibly busy man.
- Yeah. Well, yeah.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.618
Pretty damned busy, all right.

20:04.936 --> 20:06.372
Two beers.

20:06.472 --> 20:09.042
- So I'm a huge fan of your work.
- Oh, cheers.

20:09.142 --> 20:13.976
I've seen <i>Spartacus</i>, I don't know,
at least five times.

20:18.183 --> 20:21.087
- Great film.
- Yeah, it's a good film.

20:21.187 --> 20:23.756
So, you brought the cash?

20:23.856 --> 20:26.097
Anyway, I wanted to...

20:26.198 --> 20:30.113
talk to you about an incredibly
important film project.

20:30.213 --> 20:32.665
And it's extremely time sensitive.

20:32.765 --> 20:38.221
And well, we decided that there's only
one man in the world that can pull this off.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.760
And that man is?

20:50.839 --> 20:52.969
Yeah, cheers.

21:05.897 --> 21:07.784
Lovely.

21:15.707 --> 21:17.927
Anyway, this...

21:18.610 --> 21:20.397
project is of great confident...

21:22.581 --> 21:24.584
confidentiality.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.654
So everything I say from here on...

21:27.754 --> 21:30.619
is for Mr. Kubrick's ears only.

21:32.191 --> 21:35.144
Right. Yeah, yeah.

21:36.328 --> 21:39.633
Usually, Stanley prefers me
to be involved in all decisions.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.585
I talk to Mr. Kubrick alone
or there's no deal.

21:41.685 --> 21:43.403
Well...

21:43.503 --> 21:45.872
I suppose I'll just...

21:46.272 --> 21:49.637
- wait outside.
- What? What?

22:15.749 --> 22:17.537
What happened?
You were in there bloody ages.

22:17.637 --> 22:20.940
Yeah, amazing.
I really got into it, actually.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.544
By the end, I kind of felt like
I really was Kubrick.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.012
That's great. So?

22:27.112 --> 22:29.849
- So, what?
- So, what happened?

22:29.949 --> 22:34.087
- Oh, yeah. Not my thing, to be honest.
- What do you mean?

22:35.381 --> 22:38.988
It's totally out of my comfort zone.
Not my bag at all.

22:39.088 --> 22:42.328
Not your bag? You're not Stanley Kubrick!

22:42.428 --> 22:44.864
Yeah, but I'm playing Stanley Kubrick.

22:44.964 --> 22:49.185
And I had to do
what I thought Stanley would do.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.838
- It's called method acting.
- Are you totally insane?

22:51.938 --> 22:55.725
- We just want the cash, Leon!
- What?

22:59.578 --> 23:01.714
Mr. Kidman! Mr. Kidman!

23:02.114 --> 23:06.018
Mr. Kidman! I apologize for my colleague.

23:06.321 --> 23:10.423
We've had a chat now, talked it over,
and we've decided he'll do it.

23:10.523 --> 23:11.824
Yeah.

23:11.924 --> 23:17.197
Didn't you just say that it went against
all of your artistic and moral principles?

23:18.526 --> 23:21.400
Yeah, well, I changed my mind about that.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.522
Yeah, I want to do it now.
I want to do it.

23:23.622 --> 23:26.574
Yeah, yeah, I want it, yeah.
I want it! Now!

23:30.208 --> 23:33.296
Look, just give us the money
and we'll get to work.

23:33.396 --> 23:38.035
You'll get your film and you can go back home
to your hamburgers and <i>I love Lucy</i>.

23:48.093 --> 23:51.364
I'm warning you...
I can't afford to be let down about this.

23:51.464 --> 23:55.035
You better deliver or there are going
to be serious consequences.

23:56.335 --> 24:01.090
Do we look like the kind of people
that are going to let you down?

24:05.343 --> 24:07.898
I'll call you in your office
first thing in the morning.

24:18.456 --> 24:23.295
Yeah. No, just jam it.
Just... just jam it back.

24:23.395 --> 24:26.098
- Yeah. No, just jam it.
- I am fucking jamming it!

24:26.198 --> 24:28.434
What do you think I'm doing?

24:28.834 --> 24:30.603
God.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.423
How much do you think is in there?

24:41.416 --> 24:43.499
Fuck.

24:45.534 --> 24:47.902
I never thought it'd be this much.

24:49.788 --> 24:52.925
We've hit the jackpot.
That doesn't happen very often in life.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.961
No. God.

24:55.061 --> 24:58.848
- These must be the plans for the film.
- Fuck the plans.

25:01.533 --> 25:05.705
- What if he finds us?
- How? By knocking on every door in London?

25:05.805 --> 25:09.509
These guys have got so much money
they don't know what to do with it.

25:09.609 --> 25:12.178
Maybe we should lay low for a while.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.914
You know, keep a low profile.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.466
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:16.566 --> 25:18.470
Yeah. Definitely.

25:27.058 --> 25:29.979
Everything's going according to plan.

25:30.729 --> 25:33.229
I understand, sir. They're setting up
production as we speak.

25:47.312 --> 25:51.016
So... I'm the lead singer in a band.

25:51.116 --> 25:54.654
Yeah. That's right. It's a rock band.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.989
I could write you a song, if you like.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.108
I can do it right now.

25:59.208 --> 26:01.945
<i>You got a sexy ass</i>

26:02.045 --> 26:05.669
<i>I want to lick it, lick my ass</i>

26:05.769 --> 26:08.033
<i>You got a sexy ass...</i>

26:08.771 --> 26:10.573
Shit.

26:15.707 --> 26:17.827
For fuck's sake.

26:22.681 --> 26:24.901
I love you, Jonny.

26:31.956 --> 26:34.360
<i>And in our roundup of news
from the arts world,</i>

26:34.460 --> 26:37.430
<i>Stanley Kubrick,
the British-based American director</i>

26:37.530 --> 26:39.766
<i>has made a rare visit
to continental Europe,</i>

26:39.866 --> 26:44.971
<i>to talk about his new sci-fi film,
2001: A Space Odyssey.</i>

26:45.071 --> 26:48.908
<i>The film depicts space and space travel
as we've never seen before.</i>

26:49.008 --> 26:51.361
<i>The film has left audiences baffled.</i>

26:51.461 --> 26:53.679
<i>Mr. Kubrick said himself,</i>

26:53.779 --> 26:56.315
<i>"if anyone understands it
on the third viewing,</i>

26:56.415 --> 26:59.001
<i>we failed in our intention."</i>

26:59.101 --> 27:00.971
Fuck!

27:12.931 --> 27:14.295
Good morning, sweetheart.

27:23.007 --> 27:25.001
Who are you?

27:26.044 --> 27:29.415
Who am I? I'm Derek Kaye.

27:29.515 --> 27:33.219
Who the hell are you? Who let you in here?

27:33.319 --> 27:36.473
- You're Derek Kaye?
- Yeah, that's right.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.358
You're Derek Kaye?

27:39.458 --> 27:44.880
Oh, my God, is there an echo in here
or what? Yes, I'm Derek Kaye.

27:44.980 --> 27:47.089
Who's asking?

27:48.433 --> 27:51.337
Well, who was that little fuck
who was in here yesterday?

27:51.437 --> 27:53.673
I haven't got a bloody clue
what you're talking about.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.775
I'm talking about that little fuck

27:55.875 --> 27:59.278
that was in this office yesterday
saying he was Derek Kaye

27:59.378 --> 28:03.149
and saying he could bring me
Stanley fucking Kubrick!

28:03.249 --> 28:06.352
Kubrick? Oh, come on. That's ridiculous!

28:06.452 --> 28:09.805
Oh, who the fuck is asking?

28:11.822 --> 28:15.995
Right. Listen. I'm not sure which
looney bin you've just escaped from,

28:16.095 --> 28:19.962
but unless you're out of my office in the
next three seconds, I'm calling the police.

28:20.062 --> 28:23.520
Is that clear? One, two...

28:27.173 --> 28:30.260
I don't know who it was, I swear!

28:35.914 --> 28:38.084
Give me a name, goddammit!

28:38.184 --> 28:40.586
Or else I'll crush that tiny
little British head of yours.

28:40.686 --> 28:41.719
I don't know.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.226
Fuck.

28:48.156 --> 28:50.357
No, wait! Wait!

28:50.457 --> 28:54.127
Jonny Thorpe. It must have been him
because he was in here yesterday.

28:55.217 --> 28:56.418
Where can I find him?

28:57.345 --> 28:59.088
Coming.

28:59.838 --> 29:02.041
For fuck's sake.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.462
I'm not deaf, you stupid fucking...

29:07.512 --> 29:09.215
Morning, Jonny.

29:09.315 --> 29:13.485
- All right, Paul. What's up?
- Not much.

29:13.585 --> 29:17.489
- How about you?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.859
Better than all right from what I heard.

29:20.159 --> 29:24.647
My mate, the clam said he saw you last night
down at the pub. Splashing the cash.

29:24.747 --> 29:28.067
Yeah, I was going to come
and see you this morning.

29:28.167 --> 29:29.951
Had a bit of luck at the races.

29:30.051 --> 29:34.001
So, I've got Mr. Monger's money.

29:41.145 --> 29:43.033
What are you looking for?

29:45.416 --> 29:47.336
Look.

29:58.364 --> 30:00.432
You have had a stroke of luck,
haven't you?

30:00.532 --> 30:03.135
Yeah. So, how much was it?

30:03.235 --> 30:06.122
- 200?
- That's right.

30:06.637 --> 30:07.908
Plus interest.

30:09.775 --> 30:12.529
I'm sure Mr. Monger
would like to send his thanks.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.449
You know Jonny Thorpe?

30:40.971 --> 30:42.791
Okay.

31:05.163 --> 31:08.084
- You all right, mate?
- Excuse me.

31:12.270 --> 31:13.973
I'm looking for Jonny Thorpe.

31:14.073 --> 31:18.427
He was in the pub last night.
Won a shitload on a horse.

31:20.311 --> 31:21.864
Where is he?

31:23.381 --> 31:26.836
- Why should we tell you?
- Well, it'd be better for your health.

31:29.420 --> 31:32.041
Excuse me, Sonny Jim, we're actually
doing a bit of business here.

31:32.141 --> 31:35.088
Plus Jonny's our mate and we don't
go around giving out his address

31:35.188 --> 31:37.529
to cheeky yank bastards.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.716
You get what I'm saying, dickhead?

32:36.654 --> 32:37.789
He lives on Aspern Grove.

32:37.889 --> 32:41.193
If you take a left when you leave here,
then it's your second street on the right.

32:41.293 --> 32:44.179
And it's like a 10-minute walk,
or you could take a black cab,

32:44.279 --> 32:47.368
or it's three stops on the number 46 bus.

33:11.589 --> 33:15.861
It's only money, Jonny. And it wasn't
even ours in the first place.

33:15.961 --> 33:18.464
It's not just the money,
though, is it, Leon?

33:18.564 --> 33:22.419
That was our future.
I promised the band a fucking album.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.807
Now I know how that CIA guy
must have felt.

33:29.140 --> 33:32.011
- What CIA guy?
- What?

33:32.711 --> 33:36.049
You just said, now you know
how that CIA guy must have felt.

33:36.149 --> 33:37.750
What CIA guy?

33:37.850 --> 33:40.586
You know, the American.
The guy whose money it was.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.023
Wanted to do the whole...

33:44.223 --> 33:46.458
fake moon landing thingy.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.627
What are you going on about, Leon?

33:48.727 --> 33:52.588
You know. The Americans want
to do a secret fake moon landing

33:52.731 --> 33:56.736
in case the real one doesn't work,
that's why they wanted Stanley Kubrick.

33:56.836 --> 33:59.071
You're fucking joking me.

33:59.171 --> 34:01.423
No, why would I lie about that?
It's all in the documents.

34:01.523 --> 34:04.293
And you didn't think that was important
information to share with me?

34:04.393 --> 34:07.379
- That he was from the fucking CIA?
- I thought you knew.

34:07.479 --> 34:09.547
If I had known,
I wouldn't have taken the money.

34:09.648 --> 34:12.317
I'm not a total fucking idiot.
I don't want to get killed.

34:12.417 --> 34:15.808
- All right, don't make a big deal out of it.
- But it is a big deal!

34:15.908 --> 34:21.440
Don't you get that? This is really fucking
heavy seriously fucking shit we're in here!

34:21.541 --> 34:23.995
- Fuck!
- What?

34:24.495 --> 34:27.766
Why are you worried? You said he was
an American idiot and he'd never find us.

34:27.866 --> 34:32.036
That was before I knew
he was a fucking CIA agent.

34:32.136 --> 34:36.742
Fuck. All right,
we have to get out of here.

34:36.842 --> 34:38.844
- What?
- Come on, Leon!

34:39.143 --> 34:42.547
Hang on. Wait, wait. I'll take this apple.

34:42.648 --> 34:45.201
- For fuck's sake, Leon!
- Just in case.

34:47.451 --> 34:49.237
Fuck.

34:50.154 --> 34:51.991
All right.

34:52.291 --> 34:55.427
Grab whatever you can
and let's get the fuck out of here.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.786
- Hey there.
- You said he was a...

34:57.886 --> 35:02.234
proper, like, dickhead
brainless Hollywood twat.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.903
You going somewhere?

35:05.036 --> 35:06.855
What?

35:08.306 --> 35:10.176
No.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.712
- Whatever gave you that idea?
- I don't know.

35:13.012 --> 35:16.633
Just you saying, grab whatever you can,
let's get the fuck out of here.

35:17.683 --> 35:20.586
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah.

35:20.686 --> 35:24.323
I meant... you know...

35:24.423 --> 35:27.326
Let's get the fuck out of here and...

35:27.426 --> 35:30.095
get to work on that bloody film.

35:30.195 --> 35:32.264
Oh, good.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.633
'Cause for a second there
I was worried that...

35:34.733 --> 35:36.768
you might not be who you said you were.

35:36.868 --> 35:39.138
Hey there, Mr. Kubrick,
how are you doing, sir?

35:39.238 --> 35:43.559
- How's our little project coming?
- Yeah, pretty good, you know.

35:43.659 --> 35:46.528
- Ups and downs. Actors.
- Yeah.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.480
So...

35:48.780 --> 35:51.450
you two live here together?

35:51.550 --> 35:54.153
- Sort of.
- Yeah.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.822
Kind of strange, isn't it?

35:56.922 --> 36:01.336
The most important filmmaker
of all time chooses to live in this...

36:01.727 --> 36:05.225
tiny little piece of shit hovel
of a piece of shit...

36:07.098 --> 36:09.368
with his agent.

36:09.468 --> 36:11.136
A couple of faggots.

36:11.685 --> 36:13.839
I suppose. Yeah.

36:13.939 --> 36:16.241
Mr. Kidman, we really didn't mean...

36:16.341 --> 36:20.045
To steal my money? Where's the case?

36:20.145 --> 36:23.848
- We... we had a little issue.
- Where's the case?

36:24.750 --> 36:28.520
It was stolen. It wasn't my fault.

36:28.620 --> 36:29.788
- What?
- I'm sorry.

36:29.888 --> 36:33.274
- It was what?
- I swear I'll get it back.

36:33.374 --> 36:36.228
- Jonny!
- Who's that?

36:36.328 --> 36:38.730
- My mate, Glen.
- Tell him to fuck off.

36:38.830 --> 36:42.118
- What?
- Tell him to fuck off.

36:43.667 --> 36:46.005
- Fuck off, Glen!
- What?

36:46.105 --> 36:48.644
Fuck off! I'll call you later.

36:48.744 --> 36:50.977
- But you told me to come...
- Fuck off!

36:55.713 --> 36:57.883
Fucking idiot.

36:58.283 --> 37:00.752
You know how much trouble you caused me?

37:00.852 --> 37:04.155
Look. Please...
There must be something we can do.

37:04.255 --> 37:07.626
- We can help, give you whatever you need.
- I need to get a fucking movie made.

37:07.726 --> 37:11.363
Well, we can do the film, can't we, Leon?

37:11.963 --> 37:14.633
I know people. I know a director.

37:14.733 --> 37:19.755
We can go there right now.
And Leon is an actor, for God's sake!

37:20.771 --> 37:23.708
Please. Give us a chance.

37:23.808 --> 37:26.863
We can help you. We can make it work.

37:32.350 --> 37:37.356
Look, the moon landing is only
a few days away, isn't it?

37:37.926 --> 37:39.574
Do you really want to go back to your boss

37:39.674 --> 37:43.429
and tell him that you don't have Stanley
Kubrick and you don't have the money?

37:49.199 --> 37:51.544
We must be the only hope you've got.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.872
<i>We must be the only hope you've got.</i>

37:54.222 --> 37:58.777
<i>We must be the only hope you've got.
We must be the only hope you've got...</i>

38:11.021 --> 38:13.158
Here's what's going to happen.

38:13.258 --> 38:15.560
We're going to go back
to the original plan.

38:15.660 --> 38:20.966
And then the three of us,
me, and you two fucking assholes

38:21.066 --> 38:26.421
are going to film man landing on the moon.

38:27.771 --> 38:30.692
And if you so much as tell
one soul about this,

38:31.042 --> 38:36.800
I swear I will make you suffer
in ways you never even imagined.

38:40.418 --> 38:43.806
I want to meet your guy. Now.

39:02.373 --> 39:04.660
Fucking hell.

39:13.534 --> 39:15.420
Hi there.

39:15.753 --> 39:18.273
- We...
- An angel.

39:21.592 --> 39:25.480
- Is Renatus in?
- Sure.

39:27.064 --> 39:28.117
Follow me.

40:38.336 --> 40:41.106
- Artists.
- Renatus.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.141
The angel's here.

40:43.241 --> 40:47.328
What the hell are you going on about,
you silly cow?

40:49.179 --> 40:52.183
Renatus. Jonny. Jonny Thorpe.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.603
Remember me?

40:56.487 --> 40:57.923
Leon!

40:58.423 --> 41:02.060
Where have you been, my little
pixie friend? Come in, come in.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.495
What's that smell?

41:03.595 --> 41:06.331
- I think it's some kind of petrol.
- I like it.

41:06.431 --> 41:10.035
Just watch this. It's my latest movie.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.203
I like your shirt.

41:13.053 --> 41:15.624
- Thank you.
- It's called Bounce.

41:19.043 --> 41:22.747
Together we wander
through the abyss of life.

41:22.847 --> 41:26.618
From light to dark.
And from dark to light again.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.787
And then...

41:29.287 --> 41:33.058
from light back to dark.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.794
And light again.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.496
Dark again.

41:37.696 --> 41:39.481
And then...

41:40.431 --> 41:42.501
light again.

41:42.601 --> 41:44.502
This guy's a fucking asshole.

41:44.602 --> 41:47.606
Of course he is. He's a film director.

41:47.706 --> 41:50.125
I mean, look at this shit.

41:53.511 --> 41:56.247
So, what brings you here?

41:56.347 --> 41:58.850
Mr. Kidman here is a Hollywood producer.

41:58.950 --> 42:02.020
He wants to know if you'd be interested
in making a film for his company.

42:02.120 --> 42:07.526
Films. Films are dead. In five years,
no one will watch films anymore.

42:07.626 --> 42:12.047
You know what they'll watch? Computers.

42:12.463 --> 42:18.119
Yeah. This is different, though.
This is about men landing on the moon.

42:18.219 --> 42:21.006
Okay. Topical.

42:21.106 --> 42:24.576
- And what do they do there?
- They just walk around for a while,

42:24.676 --> 42:27.846
plant a flag, and they go home. That's it.

42:28.920 --> 42:31.469
You know what? I think...

42:31.569 --> 42:37.382
that might actually be the best film idea
I've ever heard in my entire life.

42:37.822 --> 42:40.158
- Really?
- I mean...

42:40.258 --> 42:42.241
it's so...

42:42.341 --> 42:43.762
simple.

42:43.862 --> 42:47.849
But at the same time it sums up
the entire human experience.

42:47.949 --> 42:51.597
We land in a strange place,
we wander around, and then...

42:51.697 --> 42:54.706
poof, we're gone.

42:54.806 --> 42:57.342
Yeah, that's what we're thinking,
you know.

42:57.442 --> 43:01.402
- Say something meaningful about life.
- Yeah, like I did with Bounce.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.949
So, when can you start?

43:05.049 --> 43:09.337
So, maybe I could shoot...

43:09.853 --> 43:12.591
- in the Autumn.
- The Autumn?

43:12.691 --> 43:16.695
No, not the fucking Autumn.
We need it in seven days.

43:16.795 --> 43:18.754
Seven da...

43:20.931 --> 43:23.735
I can't make a film in seven days.

43:23.835 --> 43:27.775
- Bounce took me three years.
- Right. We're fucking out of here.

43:28.075 --> 43:31.463
Oh, come on, man. I've seen your work.

43:31.563 --> 43:34.796
You're a pro. I mean,
look at this, for God's sake.

43:35.046 --> 43:36.531
- It's genius.
- I know.

43:36.631 --> 43:40.152
I know you can make it work.

43:46.457 --> 43:49.394
Leon... will be the hero.

43:49.494 --> 43:53.831
- Brilliant! Leon's a great actor.
- I know.

43:54.632 --> 43:57.235
But it's going to cost a lot of money.

43:57.335 --> 43:59.904
I am going to cost a lot of money.

44:00.004 --> 44:01.740
I need a lot of money.

44:01.840 --> 44:05.302
- We'll get the money. Won't we?
- You're coming with me.

44:06.477 --> 44:08.279
We'll be back in one hour.

44:08.868 --> 44:10.881
Bye, angel.

44:16.185 --> 44:17.160
Jonny!

44:17.655 --> 44:20.258
So, you're going to get
some more money from the CIA?

44:20.358 --> 44:22.827
Why would I want to do that
when you know who took the case?

44:22.927 --> 44:27.332
What? No, no, no.
I never said I knew them.

44:27.432 --> 44:30.423
The Ironmonger's got your money,
and believe me...

44:30.523 --> 44:34.835
they are people you don't want
to mess with. They're bad news.

44:36.673 --> 44:41.112
You just take me there
and you point them out to me.

44:41.212 --> 44:43.348
But they'll kill me if I do that.

44:43.748 --> 44:48.027
And I'll kill you if you don't. So, it seems
to me like you're fucked either way.

44:56.526 --> 44:58.730
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

44:58.830 --> 45:02.150
Can we think about what...

45:07.504 --> 45:11.209
By the way, just so you know,
he doesn't like swearing.

45:11.309 --> 45:13.662
Thanks. I'll try to be careful.

45:17.685 --> 45:20.068
Nice shirt, dude.

45:30.260 --> 45:32.714
Stop, for fuck's sake!

45:45.375 --> 45:47.162
Come on.

46:02.592 --> 46:04.295
Jonny!

46:04.395 --> 46:06.484
Nice surprise.

46:06.948 --> 46:09.057
Fuck me, your mom's ugly.

46:10.335 --> 46:12.103
Hello, sweetheart.

46:12.203 --> 46:14.038
She deaf and dumb?

46:14.438 --> 46:16.274
I talk, motherfucker.

46:16.374 --> 46:18.509
Put the gun down, mate.
Have a word, Jonny, will you?

46:18.609 --> 46:21.462
Want me to put the gun down?
I'll put the gun down.

46:21.562 --> 46:23.038
Fuck!

46:31.955 --> 46:34.109
Hello, Jonathan.

46:36.059 --> 46:38.112
Who's your friend?

46:38.828 --> 46:40.498
He's...

46:40.598 --> 46:44.736
That case you stole
from this asshole belongs to me.

46:45.136 --> 46:50.588
Well, you may not know this, not
from being around these parts, but...

46:51.028 --> 46:55.080
I'm in the business of collecting money...

46:55.880 --> 46:58.082
not giving it away.

46:58.182 --> 47:00.652
I thought Jonathan
might have told you that.

47:00.752 --> 47:02.366
I kind of did.

47:03.588 --> 47:05.924
You know, before I did Tower Bridge,

47:06.024 --> 47:10.395
I did the Eiffel Tower, Buckingham Palace,

47:10.495 --> 47:13.498
St. Paul's Cathedral. That was my first.

47:13.598 --> 47:16.301
Takes a tremendous amount of patience.

47:16.401 --> 47:21.289
An unwavering determination
to get to the end.

47:23.874 --> 47:26.461
No matter what the sacrifice.

47:40.290 --> 47:43.519
I'm sorry, you were saying?

47:43.619 --> 47:46.982
That was a very silly thing to do.

47:53.203 --> 47:56.255
Jonny, get the case.

47:56.940 --> 47:59.177
- Me?
- Don't do it, son.

47:59.277 --> 48:02.397
Jonny, get the case.

48:03.981 --> 48:06.734
- Jonathan.
- Jonny!

48:15.559 --> 48:17.412
Take the gun, too.

48:20.464 --> 48:22.750
Bad choice, kid.

48:26.603 --> 48:29.124
Shit. Sorry.

48:31.508 --> 48:35.731
All right. Nobody moves,
everybody will be fine.

48:44.387 --> 48:46.174
Watch out!

48:47.524 --> 48:49.244
Go!

48:55.699 --> 48:58.052
You fucking bitch.

49:00.170 --> 49:03.691
There's your money. Start now.

49:06.376 --> 49:09.264
Let's get to work. Yeah?

49:11.581 --> 49:13.276
You all right?

49:36.924 --> 49:39.828
How confident are they they'll make it?

49:40.378 --> 49:42.914
70/30.

49:43.314 --> 49:46.000
70 percent they'll make it?

49:47.584 --> 49:49.391
No.

49:50.588 --> 49:53.924
Jesus, Kidman, you'd better come through
on this film, you son of a bitch.

49:54.024 --> 49:57.012
Or we're going to wind up
with this giant dildo stuck up our asses.

50:00.497 --> 50:04.035
- Where's the fucking director?
- I'm sure he'll be here in a minute.

50:04.135 --> 50:07.155
We can start all the technical
stuff without him.

50:11.641 --> 50:14.028
What do we do about gravity?

50:14.477 --> 50:16.364
About what?

50:24.788 --> 50:27.725
- That moon is much too gray.
- What are you talking about?

50:27.825 --> 50:30.394
Thank goodness the other planets
will add some color.

50:30.494 --> 50:33.398
Other planets?
Fuck you talking about, other planets?

50:33.498 --> 50:37.168
There's only one planet.
Planet Earth. Here. Look.

50:37.568 --> 50:41.506
Yeah, but you're not seeing
the opportunity for creative expression.

50:41.606 --> 50:43.641
You don't understand
what I can do with the colors.

50:43.741 --> 50:46.777
It's not that I don't understand,
it's that I don't give a fuck.

50:46.877 --> 50:51.299
Look, I have been working for you
all night. You're going to like it.

50:52.466 --> 50:55.019
And I already have alien costumes
I can rent you.

50:55.119 --> 50:59.774
They're from my adaptation of Hamlet.
It's a great opportunity.

51:00.123 --> 51:01.793
- Leon!
- Coming!

51:01.893 --> 51:04.812
- Leon! Yeah.
- Coming.

51:06.596 --> 51:08.916
Check me out.

51:10.934 --> 51:13.871
What is all this crap? Look...

51:14.271 --> 51:17.715
You either do exactly what's written
there or you can go fuck yourself.

51:17.815 --> 51:18.877
Do you understand?

51:18.977 --> 51:20.962
- Go fuck myself?
- Go fuck yourself.

51:21.062 --> 51:23.047
- Go fuck myself?
- Go fuck yourself!

51:23.147 --> 51:25.383
Talk to me like that one more time,
Mr. Hollywood,

51:25.483 --> 51:27.852
and you'll be making your film
with your own fat fingers.

51:27.952 --> 51:30.588
I'm the director and I decide
what's good or bad.

51:30.688 --> 51:34.092
Either that or I pick up
my equipment and my crew.

51:34.192 --> 51:36.944
How do you like them apples?

51:39.829 --> 51:42.533
Renatus! Renatus!

51:42.633 --> 51:44.469
Renatus.

51:44.919 --> 51:47.055
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

51:47.155 --> 51:50.008
That guy is a Hollywood Nazi.
I don't work with Nazis.

51:50.308 --> 51:53.011
It's going to be my vision or nothing.

51:53.111 --> 51:55.313
What if we doubled your money?

51:55.413 --> 51:59.750
Do you think I'm a whore?
I'm an artist. Don't insult me.

51:59.850 --> 52:01.619
Triple.

52:01.719 --> 52:03.471
Okay.

52:21.721 --> 52:23.375
Nothing. It's all good.

52:36.787 --> 52:39.006
What the fuck is that?

52:45.996 --> 52:48.549
This is my studio.

52:51.135 --> 52:53.188
There's fucking two of them.

52:57.307 --> 52:59.894
Is that just me seeing that?

53:13.591 --> 53:15.310
Sorry.

53:48.391 --> 53:50.294
Tom Kidman?

53:50.394 --> 53:52.130
Kozinsky, transmission.

53:52.230 --> 53:56.083
Don't ask questions. Just do your job.

54:48.118 --> 54:50.199
What do you think?

55:28.357 --> 55:32.129
Right. Strip this place down. Search for any
clues as to where they might have gone.

55:32.429 --> 55:34.248
Pisshole.

55:35.932 --> 55:37.252
Good job.

55:42.704 --> 55:45.340
Hi. Hi, Glen.

55:45.440 --> 55:49.146
- What are you doing here?
- Hi, Glen? What about fuck off, Glen?

55:49.246 --> 55:52.061
Hairy Mike told me to come down.
He said there was a scene.

55:52.161 --> 55:54.840
And it looks like he's right.
What the fuck is happening?

55:55.820 --> 55:58.255
- Nothing.
- It's not nothing, is it?

55:58.355 --> 56:00.090
It looks like a bloody carnival.
What the...

56:00.190 --> 56:03.327
Honestly, I've got as much
as an idea as you do.

56:03.427 --> 56:07.097
Jonny, should I take
the costumes to the set?

56:07.197 --> 56:09.667
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Ella.

56:09.817 --> 56:11.769
I thought you were supposed
to be sorting shit out for us.

56:11.869 --> 56:13.737
I am sorting shit out.

56:13.837 --> 56:18.242
What's all this, then? What the hell
happened to my bloody rock opera?

56:18.342 --> 56:21.662
Well, you know, it's...

56:26.950 --> 56:29.920
Wait. Is this it?

56:30.020 --> 56:31.789
What?

56:32.289 --> 56:34.442
Is this the rock opera?

56:37.126 --> 56:38.862
Yes.

56:39.162 --> 56:42.032
And you didn't want to tell me 'cause
you wanted to keep it a surprise.

56:42.132 --> 56:44.118
That's right.

56:46.703 --> 56:49.820
Oh, my God! I can... actually can't believe
you pulled it off! That's amazing!

56:49.920 --> 56:54.512
Jonny. I know you want this film to look
like rubbish like it says in the documents.

56:54.612 --> 56:57.366
But could we at least have the jellyfish?

56:57.466 --> 57:00.184
Yeah, in the sky, dancing.

57:00.284 --> 57:03.320
There's no dancing jellyfish
on the moon, is there?

57:03.420 --> 57:06.357
Oh, really? Have you been there?

57:06.457 --> 57:08.125
No.

57:08.225 --> 57:10.561
Is this the director?

57:12.061 --> 57:16.200
Yeah. Glen, meet Renatus, the director.

57:16.300 --> 57:19.153
Renatus, this is Glen.

57:20.169 --> 57:23.007
- I'm the lead singer.
- Who?

57:23.107 --> 57:25.576
The lead singer of the band.

57:25.676 --> 57:27.244
For the rock opera.

57:27.344 --> 57:29.580
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.849
Look, Glen, why don't you go over there,

57:31.949 --> 57:35.453
chill out for a bit, and then I'll explain
the whole concept to you.

57:35.553 --> 57:37.572
All right. Great, man.

57:55.272 --> 57:58.343
Excuse me! Excuse me!

57:59.143 --> 58:00.837
- Who the fuck are they?
- Who?

58:00.937 --> 58:03.012
Those idiots.

58:03.565 --> 58:07.184
- Yeah. That's the band.
- The band?

58:07.284 --> 58:11.919
Yeah. We decided to make
the film into a rock opera.

58:12.019 --> 58:14.124
You want me to kill you? Is that it?

58:14.224 --> 58:16.727
Kill me? You should be thanking me.

58:16.827 --> 58:20.017
People are starting to ask questions.
This is a perfect cover story.

58:20.297 --> 58:22.969
It's totally putting
everyone off the scent.

58:24.657 --> 58:27.206
- Anything else you want to tell me?
- No.

58:28.806 --> 58:30.040
What the fuck is that now?

58:30.140 --> 58:32.789
Watch out. Watch out!

58:34.612 --> 58:36.890
What the fuck is this?

58:37.665 --> 58:39.520
It's the auditions.

58:41.284 --> 58:43.370
He's very talented.

58:44.037 --> 58:47.024
- Audition?
- Yeah.

58:47.124 --> 58:51.479
Renatus and the band want to complete
the show with some special guests.

58:53.830 --> 58:56.050
Special guests?

58:56.433 --> 59:00.724
Special fucking guests! Jesus Christ.
Get the fuck out of my way!

59:25.061 --> 59:28.607
I don't like it. That's a scheisse. Next!

01:00:17.546 --> 01:00:19.483
You all right, man?
You look a bit stressed out.

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:23.687
- Just leave me alone.
- You know, I feel like that sometimes.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:27.591
A bit stressed.
Maybe you should have a go on this.

01:00:27.691 --> 01:00:30.694
- It might chill you out a bit.
- That shit doesn't work on me.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:34.899
- What do you mean?
- I mean it doesn't do anything, man.

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:39.820
I'm CIA trained.
My mind is too strong for that shit.

01:00:40.569 --> 01:00:42.025
Nah.

01:00:42.125 --> 01:00:43.871
- What, you don't believe me?
- No.

01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:47.044
- Hand it over.
- All right.

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:10.318
See? Nothing.

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:18.302
The mission... is fraught
with technical problems.

01:01:18.402 --> 01:01:21.779
Our chances of success
are dwindling by the hour.

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:24.515
We need to know that we can rely
on the footage from London.

01:01:24.615 --> 01:01:28.552
- We're going to get that footage.
- You'd better be sure about that.

01:01:28.652 --> 01:01:31.789
The only reason we launched
this mission is because you said

01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:34.024
you could guarantee a plan B.

01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:36.994
Relax. Don't worry.

01:01:37.094 --> 01:01:39.697
Have a cigarette. Kidman's a rock.

01:01:39.797 --> 01:01:43.066
You're feeling better now? More relaxed?

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:46.937
- What's going on?
- Oh, I just gave him a bit of weed.

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:51.509
Thought it might, like,
chill him out a bit. And it has. Look.

01:01:51.609 --> 01:01:54.912
- He's like that after a bit of weed?
- Yeah, can you believe it?

01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:57.264
CIA.

01:02:02.084 --> 01:02:05.823
Yeah, it was just like a tiny bit of weed
with a bit of opium in it.

01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:09.727
Oh, for fuck's sake, Leon.
Why are you getting him fucked on opium?

01:02:09.827 --> 01:02:11.195
- What?
- Don't you understand?

01:02:11.295 --> 01:02:14.163
- If we don't deliver this film, we're dead.
- Oh, right.

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:16.984
No more opium.

01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:19.937
Look after him.

01:02:20.037 --> 01:02:23.640
We need him fully compos mentis
and on set as soon as possible, okay?

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:26.326
You can count on me, man.

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:33.917
I'm more CIA trained than you.

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:38.122
What?

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:41.175
What do you mean you can't find them?

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:45.329
- It's been five days.
- They're nowhere.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:48.182
We haven't taken our eyes off the flat.

01:02:50.132 --> 01:02:52.980
Well, what about the people they know?

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:55.639
Who's that group they fuck around with?

01:02:55.739 --> 01:02:57.891
Where are they?

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:03.337
- We'll get on it. Come on.
- Yeah.

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:07.401
You get on it.

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.913
Are you feeling okay?

01:03:36.013 --> 01:03:39.199
Not really. My head is killing me.

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:42.286
Here.

01:03:42.386 --> 01:03:44.571
Take one of these.

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:47.775
Thank you.

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:57.084
Acid is the best thing for headaches.

01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:02.823
- What?
- Yeah, trust me.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.295
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- It works, you'll see.

01:04:15.818 --> 01:04:17.521
You all right?

01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:20.274
Ready to go for rehearsal?

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:23.444
She just gave me acid.

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:27.037
Have you got any more?

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:30.217
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Sweet.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.287
Nice one, dude.

01:04:33.387 --> 01:04:36.106
Look, how high should I bounce?

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:39.877
I think you should fly, not bounce.

01:04:39.977 --> 01:04:43.113
Really? It says "bounce."

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.432
Hey, Jonny!

01:04:46.593 --> 01:04:50.487
Yeah. Hi. What's this I hear about
the astronauts having wires?

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:53.490
- Yeah, what about my wire?
- You don't need a wire.

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:57.661
You're an extra-terrestrial.
You can exist in zero gravity.

01:04:57.761 --> 01:05:02.349
Okay, yeah, fine. But I'm the most important
thing about this project. Yeah?

01:05:02.449 --> 01:05:06.203
So I want a wire. Okay? There's no way
someone else having a wire and not me.

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:09.940
So, sort it out.
And get rid of that machine.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.892
Ugly.

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:21.551
Fucking moon.

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:24.918
Right, rehearsal's over. I'm done.

01:05:25.018 --> 01:05:28.192
But that was shit. We're supposed
to be filming this tomorrow.

01:05:28.292 --> 01:05:30.020
It'll work itself out.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.847
Don't you understand?
If this doesn't work, we're all dead.

01:05:35.414 --> 01:05:38.225
Calm down, man, it's just a movie.

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:12.957
You know, this is...

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:16.810
Like, the first time I can remember...

01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:20.613
where I haven't felt like...

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:24.667
like I want to kill somebody,
you know what I mean?

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:29.372
I'm sitting here now,
and I'm looking at you.

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:33.076
- Yeah?
- And...

01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:35.487
Like, I'm fully aware that I could just...

01:08:35.587 --> 01:08:39.719
snap your neck like a twig.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.051
But...

01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:45.854
for some reason... I don't want to.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:51.161
- Look at this.
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:54.046
- Right?
- I see it.

01:08:56.624 --> 01:08:57.587
Yeah.

01:09:19.121 --> 01:09:20.834
- He looked at me!
- Go on, little fella.

01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:22.089
Go on, son.

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:25.629
He just looked me in the eye.

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:28.048
What the fuck is going on?

01:09:29.232 --> 01:09:32.118
- Are you high?
- No, man.

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:37.207
We just had a bit of... low-grade acid.

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:41.220
Do you mean while I've been out there working
my arse off trying to get this film ready,

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:43.447
you've been in here dropping acid?

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:46.349
Renatus is out of control.
Today was fucking awful.

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:49.987
Of course it was, man. I mean,
the whole fucking thing is a fucking mess.

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:55.108
- That's why we're dead already.
- Stop talking like that! Just stop it!

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:03.400
- I'm sorry, I just...
- Bad vibes.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.069
We can't give up. We need to do this.

01:10:06.169 --> 01:10:08.972
It's over, man. I mean, let it go.

01:10:09.072 --> 01:10:11.000
Yeah, drop it.

01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:13.425
So, that's it?

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:23.837
- We're all going to die.
- Yeah. We're all going to die.

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:26.907
Yeah.

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:33.446
I've never had anything but bad luck.

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:40.737
When I was born...

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:43.340
a short circuit in the incubator

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.092
set fire in the maternity ward.

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:51.097
Burnt down the entire wing
of the hospital.

01:10:52.714 --> 01:10:57.113
My father's still convinced they mixed
the babies up during the evacuation.

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:03.910
He always said I was a loser.

01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:09.583
Everybody thinks I'm a loser.

01:11:13.502 --> 01:11:16.072
I don't want to die a loser.

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:19.432
There's one thing, like, I learnt in 'nam.

01:11:19.532 --> 01:11:22.145
It's, like, Americans...

01:11:22.245 --> 01:11:24.831
we never fucking lose, man.

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:28.685
We never fucking lose.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:32.605
And we're not going
to fucking lose this time.

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:35.662
Not on my watch.

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:40.714
My watch.

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:43.801
- What time is it?
- Midnight.

01:11:43.901 --> 01:11:47.051
- I was supposed to fucking call Dickford.
- Who's Dickford?

01:11:55.878 --> 01:11:58.555
- Kidman.
- <i>Yes, sir. How are you doing?</i>

01:11:58.655 --> 01:12:00.288
How am I doing?

01:12:00.388 --> 01:12:03.987
Where the hell have you been? You were
supposed to call me first thing this morning.

01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:07.023
- <i>I know. I had some trouble.</i>
- What kind of trouble?

01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:08.492
<i>Hold on, sir.</i>

01:12:08.592 --> 01:12:13.430
- What kind of trouble did I have?
- Tell him you got lost.

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.237
- <i>I got lost.</i>
- What do you mean you got lost?

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:20.504
What do I mean I got lost?

01:12:21.304 --> 01:12:25.792
You were in a bar,
and then you walked out...

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:32.282
<i>I was in a bar, and I... I walked out.</i>

01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:38.538
But then you didn't know
whether to go left or right.

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:44.382
<i>But I didn't know whether
to go left or right.</i>

01:12:44.482 --> 01:12:48.236
<i>But then I thought, "right,
I'm going to go left." That's it.</i>

01:12:48.336 --> 01:12:51.034
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:54.524
What's the state of the operation?
Apollo 11 is in deep space.

01:12:54.624 --> 01:12:56.990
We need that footage!

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.578
Hello, sir? Is that you there?

01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:05.599
Are you fucking with me, Kidman?
Where's Kubrick?

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:13.423
- <i>Can I call you back?</i>
- No. Don't... don't hang up, Kidman.

01:13:13.523 --> 01:13:17.057
- <i>I'll call you right back, okay?</i>
- Don't, don't. Don't hang up! Kidman!

01:13:17.527 --> 01:13:21.077
- I don't think that went too well.
- I thought it was beautiful.

01:13:21.177 --> 01:13:22.966
Kidman!

01:15:33.997 --> 01:15:38.034
You been having fun, Agent Kidman?

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:49.346
My, my, my. People up high are starting
to worry about your progress.

01:15:49.446 --> 01:15:53.650
You're blowing my cover, you prick.
Everything was under control.

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:57.420
Under control? Oh, my word,
you got to be kidding me.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.389
He's playing an alien.
Part of the cover story.

01:15:59.489 --> 01:16:03.460
You don't need your cover story anymore.
We're instigating phase two of the operation.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.062
You don't think we're going to let you
run the show alone, do you?

01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:11.348
Everything is done. Nothing left to do
except film it and send back the footage.

01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:15.862
Well, I hope for your sake
it's convincing.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:18.441
Don't push me, you fucking gestapo!

01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:22.145
Tom. Who are these people?

01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:25.467
All right, everybody, get ready,
we're going to the set.

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:30.670
Get the fuck out of my way.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.491
<i>We got an address, boss.</i>

01:16:34.591 --> 01:16:36.910
<i>I think we found them.</i>

01:17:08.456 --> 01:17:10.827
All right, everybody take their places.

01:17:10.927 --> 01:17:13.446
Let's prepare the astronauts.

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:19.385
I told you this guy was a Nazi.

01:17:21.987 --> 01:17:26.142
- Not too bad?
- He fucking did it.

01:17:26.959 --> 01:17:29.913
I'll be ready to transmit in a half hour.

01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:35.402
What is going on?
It can't end like this, can it?

01:17:35.652 --> 01:17:38.020
Just shut up and listen to me.

01:17:38.170 --> 01:17:41.808
I may still be able to get you out of this,
but you gotta listen to everything I tell you.

01:17:41.908 --> 01:17:45.461
Now, they're not going to kill us
as long as they don't have the footage.

01:17:45.561 --> 01:17:48.014
But it's got to look real.

01:17:48.114 --> 01:17:50.299
So you better be really good out there.

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:52.014
Okay.

01:18:00.959 --> 01:18:03.046
- Hey! I'm Glen.
- Glen?

01:18:03.146 --> 01:18:06.015
- Yes, the lead singer, for fuck's sake.
- Oh, really?

01:18:06.115 --> 01:18:08.268
How's it going? You all right?

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:16.142
Are you okay, Leon?

01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:19.529
No, I'm freaking out, man.

01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:22.966
I don't think I can go through
with this, to be honest.

01:18:23.066 --> 01:18:27.537
- Are you fucked up?
- No. No.

01:18:27.637 --> 01:18:31.374
Well, yeah. I took some magic mushrooms.

01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:34.478
For fuck's sake, Leon!
This is not a time to do that!

01:18:34.578 --> 01:18:37.847
I know, I just wanted to take
the edge off the nerves.

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:43.286
But in retrospect, it may not have been
a good idea because I feel like...

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:45.251
I feel like...

01:18:45.351 --> 01:18:48.233
my penis is whispering to me.

01:18:48.333 --> 01:18:50.393
It's saying terrible things.

01:18:50.493 --> 01:18:53.395
It's telling me
that my parents are cousins.

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:56.199
- But I don't think they are.
- Leon, listen to me.

01:18:56.299 --> 01:19:00.665
Your penis isn't whispering to you, okay?
That's just the mushrooms talking.

01:19:01.365 --> 01:19:04.756
- I know this whole thing is a little crazy.
- Yeah.

01:19:04.856 --> 01:19:06.909
We're nearly there.

01:19:07.009 --> 01:19:10.980
All we've got to do is just deliver
this film and we'll be clear of the CIA.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.017
- Then we can go home.
- Yeah, I understand all that, man.

01:19:14.117 --> 01:19:16.753
It's just the fact is I'm looking
at you right now

01:19:16.853 --> 01:19:20.056
and your head is the size of...

01:19:20.156 --> 01:19:21.557
a tangerine.

01:19:21.657 --> 01:19:26.128
And the rest of your body is normal size.
It's just your head, it's tiny.

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:28.732
- It's minuscule.
- Leon... stop!

01:19:28.832 --> 01:19:32.201
Now, of all the stupid things
I've done in my life,

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:35.263
- this is the one thing I want to get right.
- Okay.

01:19:35.363 --> 01:19:39.158
And to do that,
I need you to sort your head out.

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:42.228
I need you, Leon.

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:45.498
- Okay.
- Come here.

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:04.183
We got pictures! We got pictures!

01:20:04.532 --> 01:20:06.819
Everything's ready.

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:10.173
Okay.

01:20:10.573 --> 01:20:12.508
Und bitte.

01:20:12.608 --> 01:20:14.496
Action!

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:22.010
Right. I think it's time
we sorted these cunts out.

01:20:30.742 --> 01:20:35.751
I'm going down the ladder now.

01:21:17.773 --> 01:21:19.445
One...

01:21:19.545 --> 01:21:21.671
small...

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:24.297
man.

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:38.761
That's one small step for man,

01:21:38.861 --> 01:21:42.464
one... one giant leap for...

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:45.868
one small man.

01:21:45.968 --> 01:21:48.324
- Something like that.
- What the fuck is he saying?

01:21:48.424 --> 01:21:50.923
He's totally screwing it up!

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:55.111
This is amazing, isn't it, Jonny?
We're actually on the moon.

01:21:55.211 --> 01:21:59.048
Who's Jonny? I'm Buzz Aldrin.

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:02.084
- Oh, shit, yeah. Sorry.
- Try not to swear, yeah?

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:04.854
- Pull.
- You got it, Buzz.

01:22:04.954 --> 01:22:06.728
- Buzz.
- Bounce.

01:22:08.024 --> 01:22:09.987
Buzz.

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:12.442
Buzz!

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:17.198
Pull... pull higher!
Pull higher, fucking idiots!

01:22:17.321 --> 01:22:19.635
- Higher!
- Fuck!

01:22:19.735 --> 01:22:22.522
One of my testicles is caught in the wire.

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:28.939
- I can't fucking do it.
- Just fucking...

01:22:29.039 --> 01:22:31.214
- I can't do it!
- For fuck's sake.

01:22:31.314 --> 01:22:33.416
- Put it in the ground.
- Stick it in there.

01:22:33.516 --> 01:22:36.552
It's not that easy, okay?
Do you want to try it?

01:22:36.652 --> 01:22:39.448
For fuck's sake. Just give it to me.

01:22:39.548 --> 01:22:42.676
- Yeah, put the flag...
- Oh, God!

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:49.871
I think I've been sick
out my back passage.

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:56.239
I feel... I feel some kind of liquid
on the backs of my legs.

01:22:56.339 --> 01:23:00.459
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Fuck, man, I feel so sick.

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:03.780
That smells so bad.
I'll have to take off my helmet.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:07.767
You can't take off your helmet.
We're on the fucking moon.

01:23:08.851 --> 01:23:12.505
- Where do you think you're going?
- To the toilet.

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:17.525
- Is that okay?
- Jackson, go with him.

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:22.331
Let me guess.

01:23:22.531 --> 01:23:26.285
- You must be the drummer.
- Shut up, you septic ponce.

01:23:27.436 --> 01:23:29.622
What the fuck?

01:23:29.955 --> 01:23:33.409
Keep the cameras rolling.
Everyone else, come with me.

01:23:37.212 --> 01:23:39.027
Leon!

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:45.471
Who are these assholes?

01:23:53.511 --> 01:23:55.439
Fly!

01:23:55.989 --> 01:23:57.995
Fly! Fly!

01:24:33.901 --> 01:24:35.888
Well, fuck me.

01:24:40.258 --> 01:24:42.806
Jesus Christ! Who the fuck are these guys?

01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:51.805
Jonny! Jonny!
Look how high I'm going! Jonny!

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:10.056
Morning!

01:25:22.517 --> 01:25:24.765
Well, go on, then.

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:31.477
Come get me, old man!

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:41.805
- You want to fucking have some?
- Fuck you!

01:25:41.905 --> 01:25:43.989
And some of that!

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.811
How's that? Come on!

01:25:48.961 --> 01:25:51.113
You fuck with me?

01:25:55.983 --> 01:25:57.386
Fuck!

01:25:57.686 --> 01:26:01.073
I'm going to chop your fucking head off!

01:26:28.115 --> 01:26:30.903
You lost, Kidman. Now you die.

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:41.214
Fucking amateur.

01:27:29.586 --> 01:27:31.289
He knocked the flag over.

01:27:41.989 --> 01:27:44.210
Hey, Jonny!

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:47.681
Jonny!

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:52.583
Hey, Jonny.

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:57.122
I missed.

01:27:58.139 --> 01:28:00.242
He's dead, Jonny.

01:28:00.342 --> 01:28:02.494
You got him.

01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:05.063
Did I?

01:28:09.484 --> 01:28:10.954
Am I going to die?

01:28:11.986 --> 01:28:13.623
No, man.

01:28:14.123 --> 01:28:18.287
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, you fainted 'cause of the shock.

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:40.532
We better leave town.

01:29:28.997 --> 01:29:31.467
<i>Los hombres descienden sobre la luna.</i>

01:29:31.567 --> 01:29:34.887
<i>Dos hombres.
Uno de ellos que está tocando...</i>

01:29:57.024 --> 01:29:58.927
<i>Surface is fine and powdery.</i>

01:29:59.027 --> 01:30:03.866
<i>I can... I can pick it up
loosely with my toe.</i>

01:30:04.166 --> 01:30:07.948
<i>It does adhere in fine layers...</i>

01:30:08.048 --> 01:30:11.825
- Is that... is that us?
- <i>like powdered charcoal...</i>

01:30:13.874 --> 01:30:15.828
No, Leon.

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:18.914
They actually did it.

01:30:19.014 --> 01:30:21.526
- They landed on the moon.
- <i>A small fraction of an inch,</i>

01:30:21.626 --> 01:30:25.320
<i>maybe an eighth of an inch,
but I can see the footprints...</i>

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.222
Boy, they sure did.

01:30:27.322 --> 01:30:32.861
<i>...and the treads
in the fine sandy particles.</i>

01:30:32.961 --> 01:30:34.374
Didn't they?

01:30:38.233 --> 01:30:40.036
<i>Man is, in fact, on the moon.</i>

01:30:40.136 --> 01:30:44.073
<i>Traquility Base, a new world,
a new place, a new solar system.</i>

01:30:44.173 --> 01:30:48.311
<i>I just can't tell you how proud
we all are of what you have done.</i>

01:30:48.411 --> 01:30:52.265
<i>For every American this has to be
the proudest day of our lives.</i>

01:31:48.604 --> 01:31:51.173
<i>Do you think it took great courage
to do what they've done?</i>

01:31:51.273 --> 01:31:53.642
<i>It took teamwork.</i>

01:31:53.742 --> 01:31:55.677
<i>Teamwork above all.</i>

01:31:55.777 --> 01:31:58.774
<i>And it's the greatest accomplishment
of the people of this nation.</i>

01:31:58.874 --> 01:32:00.249
<i>There isn't a question about that.</i>

01:32:00.349 --> 01:32:04.011
<i>Well, I'm very surprised about this.
This is wonderful.</i>
