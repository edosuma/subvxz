so suddenly.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.105

Beck alone?

00:40.207 --> 00:41.473
Or will she end up like me?

00:41.575 --> 00:43.242

about Candace.

as it turns out.

you're trying to reach him,

06:12.706 --> 06:14.806
but you can't because
you put yourself in a cage.

06:14.908 --> 06:15.974

in a cage.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.577
