[Earl] I do think being a sunburned guy
is a good costume for Halloween.

00:07.507 --> 00:09.737
- We can't both do the same thing.
- Come on.

00:09.843 --> 00:13.574
Two sunburned guys
is way funnier than one.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.296
Oh, perfect timing.

00:31.398 --> 00:35.232
I can't figure out how to get this
coffin lid on right. Can y'all help me?

00:35.335 --> 00:37.701
Joy, we're not stupid.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.704
What's gonna pop out
of there and scare us?

00:39.806 --> 00:42.366
Nothin'. Nothin'.

00:43.476 --> 00:45.876
How about we just
stand back over here...

Hey, Crabman.

01:02.162 --> 01:04.062
I told you that was a bad idea, Joy.

01:04.164 --> 01:06.496
Oh, don't worry.
The kids won't punch that hard.

01:06.599 --> 01:08.624
Is this why you called us over here?

01:08.735 --> 01:11.727
Course not. If I just wanted

I'd make you sit
through <i>Pumpkinhead</i> again.

01:41.568 --> 01:44.935
My hands were shakin' so bad, I could
barely put my makeup on for the news crew.

01:45.038 --> 01:48.371
Fine. I'll throw a party.
But you gotta admit, you loved it...

01:48.475 --> 01:51.035
when they let you drive the speedboat
when they were draggin' the lake.

01:51.144 --> 01:54.307

that spooky ice to go with it.

02:09.162 --> 02:12.859
We tried pouring hot water over regular ice,
but you know what happened?

That's her nephew. Oscar.

02:25.078 --> 02:27.842

02:27.947 --> 02:30.211
Her sister sent him
to America for a vacation.

He arrived yesterday.

Wait. Are you a dishwasher?

02:41.828 --> 02:44.388
- No.
- Yeah, we didn't order this.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.397
The really sad part is...

02:46.499 --> 02:49.297
the waybill said "bananas,
magazines and little boy."

02:49.402 --> 02:52.200
I can't help but think someone
at Customs wasn't doing their job.

02:52.305 --> 02:55.365
I wish I had a little brother.
Thanks, Earl.

02:55.475 --> 02:59.206
Randy, you know it's on my list-
cost Randy a little brother.

02:59.312 --> 03:02.145
- How'd you do that?
- Dad made Mom get fixed...

03:02.248 --> 03:05.740
after he caught Earl playing a game
of"Watch Randy in the washing machine."

03:05.852 --> 03:09.413
I swallowed a lot of bleach.
That's why I can't taste salt.

03:09.522 --> 03:12.719
I put it on the gentle cycle.
You never tell that part of the story.

03:12.825 --> 03:14.918
Well, if you're interested
in getting a brother...

03:15.028 --> 03:17.588
you could try the local office
of Big Bros, Little Bros.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.597
Oh, yeah. I've seen their sign.

03:19.699 --> 03:23.362
I always thought it was a hip-hop
clothing store with a huge range of sizes.

03:23.469 --> 03:26.597
No, they match up needy young boys
with older, mostly unmarried men...

03:26.706 --> 03:28.606

under their wing.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.541
Surprisingly enough,
usually it works out just fine.

03:31.644 --> 03:34.636
<i>[Earl Narrating] So me and Randy</i>
<i>cleaned up, put on our Sunday clothes...</i>

03:34.747 --> 03:36.806

03:36.916 --> 03:39.316

about yourself, Randy.

03:39.419 --> 03:42.616
Well, I'm 31 and I live in a motel.

03:42.722 --> 03:46.385
I have three pairs of pants
and five shirts...

03:46.492 --> 03:50.121

sums me up, yeah.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.960
Oh, and this is my brother, Earl.
We're very close.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.331
- We even sleep in the same bed.
- B-But not in a weird way.

<i>Yeah, and we sleep facin'out...</i>

<i>didn't get accepted as a big brother...</i>

I don't know where I went wrong.

05:11.911 --> 05:15.312
You didn't, Randy. You were perfect.
Those people are stupid.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.815
A little brother doesn't
have to be a person.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.215
Maybe you could get a pet.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.084
W-W-Well, n-not a pet.
Maybe a- a plant.

05:23.189 --> 05:26.090

I'm sorry, plants! I'm just mad!

05:28.995 --> 05:30.553
Earl, could you give me a hand?

05:30.663 --> 05:34.190
There's a customer at Club Chubby
who thinks he's hilarious.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.894
None of the other strippers
will help me get it off.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.164
They're just jealous 'cause they never get fives.

05:39.272 --> 05:43.470
Do they get little brothers? 'Cause then
they should stop bitchin' and shut the hell up!

05:43.576 --> 05:46.272
I'm sorry, other strippers.
I'm just mad!

05:46.379 --> 05:49.644
- What's wrong with him?
- Randy wanted a little brother...

05:49.749 --> 05:53.344
but we couldn't find one,
so now we've moved on to plants.

05:53.453 --> 05:56.513
What about Oscar?
He could use a male influence in his life.

05:56.622 --> 05:59.420
When he was a baby, his dad
left to join The Rebels.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.857

Yeah, I've seen their tapes
on sale at the car wash.

06:04.397 --> 06:06.797
- But-
- He could really use a good male role model.

06:06.899 --> 06:11.029
Well, I'm no male model,
but I'd be a darned good big brother.

06:11.137 --> 06:14.470
- What do you think, Earl?
- Yeah.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.974
Oscar is, uh, definitely an option.

06:17.076 --> 06:19.670
We'll keep him in mind
if it doesn't work out with the plant.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.770
No, I said I hated plants.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.282

if the first pin they stick in makes her pop?

06:58.584 --> 07:02.611
- That's not realistic.
- Realistic? Mummies don't have tails.
