to your clients immediately.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.767
Good night, sir.

17:04.649 --> 17:07.025
- Yesterday it was Tom.
- Yes?

17:07.110 --> 17:09.778
- Today it's George.
- Yes?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.363
Okay.

17:12.407 --> 17:13.907
Hoodlums.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.203
Artistic bums.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.164
Both of 'em put together
aren't worth a dime.

17:21.249 --> 17:23.750
Gilda, no one knows better than you
how unselfish I've been...

17:23.835 --> 17:25.836
in all matters pertaining to you.

17:27.088 --> 17:29.005
- You've been nice.
- I've been marvelous.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.216
No, just nice.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.218
Gilda, I've been your friend
for five years -

17:33.302 --> 17:37.806
And I want you to remain my friend
for the next 50 years, so please shut up.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.315
Max, have you ever been in love?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.109
This is no time to answer that.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.445
Have you ever felt
your brain catch fire...

17:51.529 --> 17:55.824
and a curious, dreadful thing
go right through your body...

17:55.908 --> 17:59.119
down, down to your very toes...

17:59.203 --> 18:01.496
and leave you with your ears ringing?

18:03.583 --> 18:06.001
That's abnormal.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.128
Well, that's how I felt
just before you came in.

18:08.212 --> 18:11.131
Yes? How'd you feel yesterday
after your promenade with Tom?

18:11.215 --> 18:12.799
Just the opposite.

18:12.884 --> 18:17.888
It started in my very toes
and came up, up, up very slowly...

18:17.972 --> 18:20.015
until my brain caught fire.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.434
But the ringing in the ears
was the same.

18:26.564 --> 18:27.856
Hello.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.441
[Tom]
Hello.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.239
Did you go for the laundry?

18:36.324 --> 18:38.408
Hardly.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.577
Why not?

18:40.661 --> 18:42.579
Two cans of sardines, five francs.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.999
Madame Poperino, blackmail,
seven francs 50.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.251
- No laundry.
- That's fine.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.171
I haven't got a clean shirt
to my name.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.423
Clean shirt?

18:53.508 --> 18:55.008
What's up, a romance?

18:55.092 --> 18:57.761
I'm not talking about pajamas.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.222
I'm talking about a clean shirt.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.308
I don't want to go around
looking like a rag picker.

19:03.392 --> 19:07.395
I'm talking about a white shirt,
a shirt without a spot, without any holes...

19:07.480 --> 19:10.273
that won't fall apart
when you unbutton your coat.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.076
How old is the laundress?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.744
Oh, she's about 45.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.913
A young 45?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.706
Oh, I don't know.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.583
She goes barefoot.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.128
She's, uh, rather plump,
a little soapy...

19:32.213 --> 19:34.381
but a very interesting mustache.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.967
Very charming, very charming.
Not my type.

19:38.344 --> 19:42.347
Mustache or no mustache,
I need a clean shirt for tomorrow.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.321
End of Act One.

19:58.406 --> 19:59.656
Curtain.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.575
Don't read it.
I know it by heart.

20:01.659 --> 20:04.953
You remember where Bassington has found out
that Edgar was the man on the fire escape?

20:05.037 --> 20:07.330
- All right, shoot!
- "There's a pause.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.749
- Edgar smiles maddeningly."
- Go on, go on!

20:09.834 --> 20:13.044
"Bassington plays with his beard
in order to cover his emotion.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.504
Edgar speaks.
[Clears Throat]

20:14.589 --> 20:19.092
'I'm afraid, Bassington, that you are right,
but nonetheless boring.'

20:19.176 --> 20:22.971
Bassington studies his fingernails
like a man of the world, crosses to left.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.181
Edgar continues strumming his mandolin.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.392
Bassington, resuming with his beard -

20:27.476 --> 20:30.520
'I have only one thing to say to you.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.564
Immortality may be fun...

20:32.648 --> 20:37.027
but it's not fun enough
to take the place of 100% virtue...

20:37.111 --> 20:39.946
and three square meals a day."'

20:44.452 --> 20:46.745
What's the matter?

20:46.829 --> 20:50.540
- So! Double-crossing me, huh?
- What are you buzzing about?

20:50.625 --> 20:53.251
You didn't write that speech alone,
and I know where you got it!

20:53.336 --> 20:56.338
- Well, if you think -
- And don't try to lie out of it!

20:56.422 --> 20:58.798
He was in here - Mr. Plunkett.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.885
And it isn't difficult
to guess why he was here either.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.846
So you've been making love to Gilda.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.264
- Now, listen, if you -
- I know!

21:06.349 --> 21:09.351
"100% virtue
and three square meals a day!"

21:12.688 --> 21:14.689
Wait a minute.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.401
So you've heard that speech before!

21:20.571 --> 21:23.073
Where did you hear that speech before?

21:23.157 --> 21:24.824
Oh, I see.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.493
Clean shirt, eh?

21:26.577 --> 21:29.913
- So he caught you with Gilda.
- It's a lie! He didn't catch me.

21:29.997 --> 21:33.249
Very pretty work.
True blue George.

21:33.334 --> 21:37.170
Look who's talking about true blue!
I oughta bust you right in that ugly pan of yours!

21:37.254 --> 21:39.422
Let's behave like civilized people.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.424
It's quite apparent beyond any question...

21:41.509 --> 21:44.427
that you behaved in this matter
as a rather common, ordinary rat.

21:44.512 --> 21:45.929
I'm leaving.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.188
[Door Slams]

21:55.940 --> 21:57.399
Where's my suitcase?

21:57.483 --> 21:59.651
Or have you sold it to somebody?

22:04.991 --> 22:08.535
This is a little silly,
after 11 years of friendship.

22:08.619 --> 22:10.620
You should have
considered that earlier!

22:24.927 --> 22:27.846
Do you mind a personal question?

22:27.930 --> 22:29.514
Not at all.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.516
Are you pretty hard hit?

22:31.600 --> 22:34.144
That's none of your business.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.563
- And you?
- Likewise.

22:42.153 --> 22:45.155
What a pity we had to fall in love
with the same girl.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.828
Charming, isn't she?

22:51.912 --> 22:53.663
Rather.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.165
Nice eyes.

22:55.249 --> 22:56.750
Of a sort.

22:57.877 --> 23:01.129
Well, I guess we're through.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.214
Looks like it.

23:03.299 --> 23:06.384
Curious to have a little bit of feminine fluff
breaking up our friendship.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.595
Sad.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.346
Quite a dilemma.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.142
I wonder if she's worth it.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.102
I wonder.

23:16.187 --> 23:17.645
In fact, I doubt it.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.273
There's only one thing we know about her -
she's full of deceit.

23:20.357 --> 23:23.234
- She's trying to hang it on both of us.
- We shouldn't let her get away with it.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.236
- She's a troublemaker.
- We ought to put our foot down.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.238
You're right.
We oughtn't to let her break it up.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.949
I've been listening to these
half-witted dramas of yours for 11 years!

23:30.034 --> 23:32.202
Yes, and I've grown cockeyed looking
at those humpty-dumpty pictures of yours.

23:32.286 --> 23:35.121
And we should give up all this on account of
some girl we met on a train?

23:35.206 --> 23:36.414
- Third class!
- No woman's worth it.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.208
Absolutely not.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.464
No more clean shirts?

23:44.548 --> 23:46.758
- We ignore her, 50-50.
- Fine.

23:49.345 --> 23:51.805
- Sacrifice helps an artist.
- Exactly!

23:51.889 --> 23:54.557
The sorrows of life
are the joys of art.

23:54.642 --> 23:57.560
- I don't think we ought to discuss her anymore.
- Right.

23:57.645 --> 24:02.398
If, uh, the occasion arises
which requires our mentioning her at all...

24:02.483 --> 24:05.401
we'll refer to her
as, uh, Miss Farrell.

24:05.486 --> 24:08.404
- It'll make the whole thing more impersonal.
- Exactly.

24:08.489 --> 24:12.992
Hey, George,
did you really sell my suitcase?

24:15.079 --> 24:17.247
Yeah.

24:17.331 --> 24:18.331
Okay.

24:18.415 --> 24:21.584
[Woman] Monsieur Chambers
ou Monsieur Curtis. Au téléphone!

24:22.670 --> 24:24.337
Telephone?

24:25.548 --> 24:29.342
Well, um - Oh.
Answer it if you wish.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.053
Go ahead.
I trust you.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.638
Oh, thanks.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.606
- Merci beaucoup.
- De rien.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.150
Hello?

24:45.234 --> 24:46.609
Yes?

24:47.945 --> 24:49.946
Well, uh, just a second.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.908
It's, uh - It's Miss Farrell.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.371
What do you want, Gilda?

24:58.455 --> 25:00.123
I beg your pardon.

25:02.251 --> 25:03.501
I see.

25:03.586 --> 25:05.378
I-I see.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.964
Well, just a second, please.

25:09.466 --> 25:12.385
- She wants to come up tomorrow.
- Tell her absolutely no.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.554
Okay.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.931
Uh, well -

25:17.016 --> 25:19.100
Uh, well, hold the wire.

26:15.032 --> 26:17.200
[Bell Ringing]

26:20.788 --> 26:22.789
[Ringing Stops]

26:38.055 --> 26:40.223
Miss Farrell's a little late.

26:41.308 --> 26:42.809
It hardly matters.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.937
I think we ought to be polite.

26:47.022 --> 26:51.359
I'm going to assume
a very nonchalant attitude.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.569
[Knocking]

26:56.448 --> 26:58.741
Don't forget. Nonchalant.

27:04.415 --> 27:06.541
Vous êtes bien Monsieur Curtis
et Monsieur Chambers?

27:06.625 --> 27:08.459
Oui.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.212
Je les ai trouvés.
Ils habitent ici.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.923
- Au cinquième.
- Merci bien.

27:33.027 --> 27:38.406
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

27:39.575 --> 27:41.576
How do you do?

28:14.985 --> 28:17.445
[Laughing]

28:33.170 --> 28:34.712
[Bell Dings]

28:43.013 --> 28:46.140
Tommy, you're such a child.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.923
I'm so nervous.

29:20.008 --> 29:23.678
Couldn't we all be
a little bit more nonchalant?

29:27.433 --> 29:30.726
I came here to make a confession -

29:30.811 --> 29:34.272
a confession hard to make
at 11:00 in the morning.

29:36.859 --> 29:39.527
[Whispering, Inaudible]

29:39.611 --> 29:41.028
[Gilda]
George.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.530
Yes, please?

29:43.907 --> 29:45.992
Sit down here.

29:46.076 --> 29:47.952
[Mutters]
Well -

29:52.207 --> 29:55.376
- Shall I leave the room?
- No, please!

29:56.420 --> 29:59.505
George. Dear George.

29:59.590 --> 30:03.676
When I let you make love to me yesterday,
I didn't tell you something.

30:03.760 --> 30:07.305
I didn't tell you that the day before,
Tom and I had -

30:09.433 --> 30:11.809
Did he tell you?

30:11.894 --> 30:13.519
No.

30:13.604 --> 30:16.564
- Thank you, Tommy.
- You're very welcome.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.734
George, promise me
you won't start smashing furniture.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.696
I'm more than fond of Tommy.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.742
- I'm sorry, old man.
- Quite all right.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.785
- Thank you.
- Okay!

30:31.788 --> 30:34.123
But -

30:36.043 --> 30:39.378
Tom, when we were in the park -
Do you remember?

30:39.463 --> 30:42.048
- Very well.
- I didn't tell you.

30:42.132 --> 30:46.135
That morning I made a date with George
for the next evening in my house...

30:46.220 --> 30:48.221
and I didn't call it off.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.890
- And I want to be truthful. I -
- Oh, I see.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.809
In other words,
you're very fond of George.

30:53.894 --> 30:55.353
More than fond.

30:58.732 --> 31:03.402
A thing happened to me
that usually happens to men.

31:05.614 --> 31:08.908
You see, a man can meet two,
three, or even four women...

31:08.992 --> 31:10.910
and fall in love with all of them...

31:10.994 --> 31:14.580
and then, by a process of, uh,
interesting elimination...

31:14.665 --> 31:17.333
he's able to decide
which one he prefers.

31:17.417 --> 31:22.630
But a woman must decide purely on instinct,
guesswork, if she wants to be considered nice.

31:22.714 --> 31:26.008
Oh, it's quite all right for her to try on
a hundred hats before she picks one out, but -

31:26.093 --> 31:29.011
Very fine. But which chapeau
do you want, madam?

31:34.017 --> 31:35.685
Both.

31:37.187 --> 31:40.940
You see, George, you're sort of like
a ragged straw hat...

31:41.024 --> 31:43.651
with a very soft lining.

31:44.695 --> 31:46.612
A little bit out of shape...

31:46.697 --> 31:49.031
very dashing to look at...

31:49.116 --> 31:52.201
and very comfortable to wear.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.329
And you, Tom.

31:55.414 --> 31:59.000
Chic, piquant, perched over one eye...

31:59.084 --> 32:02.169
and has to be watched on
windy days.

32:04.172 --> 32:07.550
And both so becoming.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.677
Ohh!

32:11.221 --> 32:15.057
Oh, I'm the most unhappy woman
in the world!

32:15.142 --> 32:17.977
Poor girl.
She's in rather a tough spot.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.895
Mm-hmm.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.356
George.

32:22.441 --> 32:26.319
Dear George, there's no use pretending
you could make me forget Tom.

32:26.403 --> 32:28.821
- I'd miss him.
- You would not.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.407
But for the sake of argument, okay.

32:31.491 --> 32:35.328
And, Tom, if I went with you
up hill and down dale...

32:35.412 --> 32:38.247
he would haunt me
like a bogeyman.

32:38.332 --> 32:41.250
It's a pitiful situation.

32:41.877 --> 32:45.129
Well, if it'll make you happy,
I'm willing to step out.

32:45.213 --> 32:49.717
Never mind the grandstand gesture!
I know how you'd step out - with a club.

32:49.801 --> 32:53.512
On the other hand, if you feel
that you can't get along without her...

32:53.597 --> 32:55.806
it wouldn't be the first sacrifice
I've made for you.

32:55.891 --> 32:58.184

of course.

you could finish your new play.

valuable connections in London.

as good work in the midst of all that hullabaloo...

I'll kick your teeth out, tear your head off
and beat some decency into you!

1:03:36.563 --> 1:03:38.689
Cheap melodrama. Very dull.

1:03:43.028 --> 1:03:44.737
George, stop it.

1:03:45.363 --> 1:03:46.739
Still very dull.

1:03:46.823 --> 1:03:49.366
I suppose you feel sorry for him.

1:03:49.451 --> 1:03:51.785
I feel sorry for you.

1:03:51.870 --> 1:03:53.787
I'm sorry I hurt you.

1:03:55.457 --> 1:03:58.000
But it was inevitable.

1:03:58.084 --> 1:04:00.419
Go on.
Get out of here, both of you.

1:04:01.421 --> 1:04:03.130
It's hard to believe I -
I loved you both.

1:04:03.215 --> 1:04:05.132
- George!
- I don't want any part of either of you.

1:04:05.217 --> 1:04:09.220
Go on! Go with him in his top hat
and fancy pants and silly name in lights...

1:04:09.304 --> 1:04:11.305
and good luck to both of you!

1:04:13.475 --> 1:04:15.684
The London train leaves at 4:00.

1:04:16.978 --> 1:04:19.021
You'll be very happy.

1:04:19.105 --> 1:04:20.606
I promise.

1:04:22.192 --> 1:04:23.859
Thank you, Tom.

1:04:23.944 --> 1:04:25.444
I'll pack.

1:04:30.325 --> 1:04:31.992
Good-bye, George.

1:04:33.578 --> 1:04:35.621
You did the right thing
about the Butterfields.

1:04:35.705 --> 1:04:37.581
And, George...

1:04:37.666 --> 1:04:41.126
after I've gone, don't change.

1:04:41.211 --> 1:04:43.546
Don't ever bow to double chins.

1:04:43.630 --> 1:04:45.256
Stay an artist.

1:04:45.340 --> 1:04:46.840
That's important.

1:04:48.051 --> 1:04:51.887
In fact, the most important thing.

1:05:17.831 --> 1:05:22.042
I didn't want to praise you in front of Gilda,
but you certainly pack a wicked right.

1:05:23.128 --> 1:05:24.795
A real wallop.

1:05:32.012 --> 1:05:34.305
There are a number of things here
which belong to her.

1:05:34.389 --> 1:05:35.931
Oh, that's all right. Never mind.

1:05:36.016 --> 1:05:38.851
No, no, I don't want them.
Where shall I send them?

1:05:38.935 --> 1:05:41.604
Forward them in my name
in care of the Carlton Theatre, London.

1:05:42.772 --> 1:05:46.317
- And her mail?
- Same place. I'll see that she gets it.

1:05:46.401 --> 1:05:49.069
- Anything else?
- Not that I can think of.

1:05:50.238 --> 1:05:52.948
If anything should come up,
will you be at this address?

1:05:53.033 --> 1:05:56.577
That's immaterial.
I don't wish to enter into any correspondence.

1:05:56.661 --> 1:05:58.245
As you wish.

1:05:58.330 --> 1:06:00.331
Better tell her to hurry up.
It's getting to be a strain.

1:06:00.415 --> 1:06:02.958
- Well, you gotta give her a chance to pack.
- Well, tell her to hurry up!

1:06:03.043 --> 1:06:05.044
All right! All right!
Hurry up, Gilda!

1:06:06.755 --> 1:06:08.672
Hurry up, darling.

1:06:10.508 --> 1:06:12.426
[Bell Dings]

1:06:12.510 --> 1:06:14.428
Here, you rattlesnake.

1:06:15.263 --> 1:06:18.432
- So that's how you feel.
- Yes, that's how I feel. Understand?

1:06:18.516 --> 1:06:20.017
Perfectly.

1:06:20.101 --> 1:06:23.020
- I felt that way once.
- [Bell Dings]

1:06:23.104 --> 1:06:25.606
Gilda, have you got room in your trunk?

1:07:02.102 --> 1:07:04.061
Here. For you.

1:07:04.145 --> 1:07:06.271
- What's that?
- A note from Gilda.

1:07:06.356 --> 1:07:08.023
[Grunts]

1:07:21.871 --> 1:07:23.539
"Tommy dear.

1:07:26.334 --> 1:07:31.463
I am running away because I am afraid
your house in London has a chimney too...

1:07:31.548 --> 1:07:34.383
and I fancy on rainy nights,
I would hear -

1:07:38.179 --> 1:07:42.266
And I fancy on rainy nights,
I would hear that old devil George moaning.

1:07:42.350 --> 1:07:44.893
So be nice, and let me be nice.

1:07:44.978 --> 1:07:47.479
Maybe I'll like it. Gilda."

1:08:36.488 --> 1:08:38.822
- You think she'll come back?
- No.

1:08:39.991 --> 1:08:41.658
Should we try to find her?

1:08:41.743 --> 1:08:43.368
What's the use?

1:08:43.453 --> 1:08:46.789
The mother of the arts
wants to be a nice girl.

1:08:48.166 --> 1:08:50.417
Tragic.
[Hiccups]

1:08:50.502 --> 1:08:52.961
No, it's comic.

1:08:53.046 --> 1:08:56.548
Two slightly used artists
in the ash can.

1:08:59.093 --> 1:09:00.803
You'll get drunk.

1:09:02.388 --> 1:09:04.765
It's the only sensible thing to do.

1:09:06.267 --> 1:09:07.935
[Mumbling]

1:09:08.770 --> 1:09:11.980
To Gilda.

1:09:16.611 --> 1:09:18.237
[Tommy Clears Throat]

1:09:19.656 --> 1:09:22.407
Would you care to hit me?
Please help yourself.

1:09:22.492 --> 1:09:24.868
Sorry. I'm too high-class.

1:09:24.953 --> 1:09:27.454
- A gentleman, huh?
- To my fingertips.

1:09:28.540 --> 1:09:33.085
May I refer you to a letter sent to you
from London in a similar crisis?

1:09:33.169 --> 1:09:35.212
A very high-class document.

1:09:35.296 --> 1:09:38.757
I could have enclosed
some smallpox germs easily.

1:09:38.842 --> 1:09:40.843
But you didn't.

1:09:40.927 --> 1:09:43.470
Very considerate.

1:09:43.555 --> 1:09:45.472
Let's drink to that.

1:09:56.317 --> 1:09:58.569
To smallpox germs.

1:09:58.653 --> 1:10:01.864
In Latin, variola cocci.

1:10:11.332 --> 1:10:13.959
I think we're being very sensible.

1:10:14.043 --> 1:10:15.919
Extremely.

1:10:16.004 --> 1:10:18.922
- Good for our livers.
- Good for our immortal souls.

1:10:19.007 --> 1:10:21.174
But bad for our stomachs.

1:10:21.259 --> 1:10:23.468
Ah! That's loose thinking.

1:10:23.553 --> 1:10:27.848
What's bad for your stomach
may be highly entertaining for my stomach.

1:10:28.850 --> 1:10:33.020
I'm glad the conversation
has taken a scientific turn.

1:10:33.104 --> 1:10:36.106
Well, it's better than discussing this Gilda.

1:10:36.190 --> 1:10:38.317
- We must forget Gilda.
- Utterly.

1:10:39.527 --> 1:10:41.778
- Let's change the subject.
- Right.

1:10:41.863 --> 1:10:44.698
Let's talk about something entirely new.

1:10:45.950 --> 1:10:48.702
Let's talk about ourselves.

1:10:48.786 --> 1:10:50.454
Very interesting.

1:10:59.213 --> 1:11:00.881
- To ourselves.
- No.

1:11:01.883 --> 1:11:03.675
It's bad taste.

1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:06.261
Well, we can't drink to nothing.

1:11:06.346 --> 1:11:08.972
Well, it's better
than drinking to ourselves.

1:11:10.308 --> 1:11:11.808
- To nothing.
- No!

1:11:12.810 --> 1:11:14.853
I refuse to be silly.

1:11:14.938 --> 1:11:16.855
That's right.

1:11:16.940 --> 1:11:19.399
Well, there must be a reason
for drinking.

1:11:22.195 --> 1:11:24.321
- To, uh -
- No!

1:11:24.405 --> 1:11:26.698
I beg your pardon.

1:11:26.783 --> 1:11:30.911
To Kaplan and McGuire.

1:11:30.995 --> 1:11:33.622
Uh, don't be hasty.

1:11:34.916 --> 1:11:36.583
To Kaplan.

1:11:40.588 --> 1:11:42.089
Ah.

1:11:47.095 --> 1:11:49.137
And now to McGuire.

1:11:54.352 --> 1:11:56.311
A letter to my mother.

1:11:57.522 --> 1:12:00.607
Mrs. Oscar F. Plunkett,
Utica, New York.

1:12:01.818 --> 1:12:03.527
Dear Mama:

1:12:03.611 --> 1:12:07.948
I will arrive on the 25th of this month
on the U.S. Liner S.S. Manhattan.

1:12:08.950 --> 1:12:11.785
I will be accompanied
by Miss Gilda Farrell.

1:12:12.870 --> 1:12:16.790
Miss Gilda Farrell is the daughter
of Mr. And Mrs. Anthony G. Farrell...

1:12:16.874 --> 1:12:19.376
of Fargo, North Dakota.

1:12:30.138 --> 1:12:32.097
[Car Horn Honking]

1:12:42.692 --> 1:12:45.027
- [Honking Continues]
- [No Audible Dialogue]

1:12:55.246 --> 1:12:57.706
[Honking Continues]

1:13:07.341 --> 1:13:09.760
- Got the ring?
- Check.

1:13:09.844 --> 1:13:11.636
- Feel nervous, Max?
- No.

1:13:11.721 --> 1:13:14.181
Had a fine nap.
Feel a hundred percent.

1:13:44.670 --> 1:13:48.090
How does it feel to be Mrs. Plunkett?
Any different?

1:13:48.174 --> 1:13:52.552
Well, it feels like standing
with your feet on the ground.

1:13:53.763 --> 1:13:56.640
Peaceful, Max, and so secure.

1:13:56.724 --> 1:13:58.058
You bet.

1:13:58.142 --> 1:14:01.144
It's going to be nice
to be a law-abiding citizen.

1:14:01.229 --> 1:14:02.729
Gilda!

1:14:03.731 --> 1:14:05.690
What lovely flowers.

1:14:07.485 --> 1:14:10.278
"Strump and Egelbauer."

1:14:10.363 --> 1:14:12.322
Very fine people,
Strump and Egelbauer.

1:14:12.406 --> 1:14:14.157
- Biggest cement people in town.
- Oh.

1:14:14.242 --> 1:14:15.867
Oh, you'll like 'em.

1:14:15.952 --> 1:14:17.619
They sound adorable.

1:14:17.703 --> 1:14:19.037
- Gilda.
- Yes, Max?

1:14:19.122 --> 1:14:22.249
Now that it's all over -
the excitement, et cetera -

1:14:22.333 --> 1:14:24.417
I'd like to know,
what's your attitude?

1:14:24.502 --> 1:14:26.336
My attitude?
Well, toward what?

1:14:26.420 --> 1:14:28.171
I mean, do you love me?

1:14:28.256 --> 1:14:29.714
Oh, Max.

1:14:29.799 --> 1:14:32.509
People should never ask that question
on their wedding night.

1:14:32.593 --> 1:14:34.845
It's either too late or too early.

1:14:34.929 --> 1:14:37.013
I'm your wife, Max.

1:14:37.098 --> 1:14:38.932
That's well put.

1:14:40.977 --> 1:14:43.353
- Gilda, it's 9:30.
- Oh, that late?

1:14:43.437 --> 1:14:46.022
Yes, and I have an appointment
in the morning, 10:15 sharp.

1:14:46.107 --> 1:14:48.066
Oh, yes.

1:14:48.151 --> 1:14:49.651
Beautiful!

1:14:52.655 --> 1:14:54.698
"Kaplan and McGuire"!

1:14:54.782 --> 1:14:57.367
Your friends from now on,
as well as mine.

1:15:10.464 --> 1:15:12.132
What did they do that for?

1:15:12.216 --> 1:15:14.885
Why, they want to remember us.
I think it's very nice of them.

1:15:14.969 --> 1:15:16.636
This is no time for remembering.

1:15:16.721 --> 1:15:20.515
It would have been much more tactful
of them to forget. I think it's offensive.

1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:23.226
Oh, well, now,
that's a closed chapter in your life.

1:15:23.311 --> 1:15:25.437
Anyhow, you've nothing
to worry about on that score.

1:15:25.521 --> 1:15:28.106
- I've forgiven you.
- Forgiven me? For what?

1:15:28.191 --> 1:15:29.858
Oh, that's all right.

1:15:29.942 --> 1:15:32.736
- Well, I don't want to be forgiven!
- Well, I forgive you just the same.

1:15:32.820 --> 1:15:34.738
It'll make you feel better.

1:15:34.822 --> 1:15:36.448
It's their idea of a joke.

1:15:36.532 --> 1:15:40.619
I can just see them sitting in China,
laughing their heads off.

1:15:40.703 --> 1:15:42.370
About what?

1:15:43.456 --> 1:15:45.290
It's a rotten trick.

1:15:45.374 --> 1:15:47.083
- It's cheap.
- Well, it shouldn't surprise you.

1:15:47.168 --> 1:15:50.420
They never fooled me for a minute.
Hooligans.

1:15:50.504 --> 1:15:52.756
Max, I don't care
to discuss them at all...

1:15:52.840 --> 1:15:55.217
but if you ever feel it's necessary
to mention them...

1:15:55.301 --> 1:15:57.385
don't call them hooligans!

1:15:57.470 --> 1:15:59.763
Oh, well, of course,
they have some fine qualities.

1:15:59.847 --> 1:16:02.432
Please stop talking about them!

1:16:02.516 --> 1:16:04.434
It's my wedding night.

1:16:04.518 --> 1:16:07.187
Leave those two boys
where they are - in China!

1:16:10.024 --> 1:16:12.359
I've an appointment tomorrow morning.

1:16:14.070 --> 1:16:16.071
10:15 sharp. It's important.

1:18:09.727 --> 1:18:11.644
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

1:18:17.651 --> 1:18:20.612
Well, Gilda. Great news for you.

1:18:20.696 --> 1:18:22.697
- Our party's in the bag.
- Really?

1:18:22.782 --> 1:18:24.908
- Yes, sir. Guess what.
- I give up.

1:18:24.992 --> 1:18:27.577
- Mr. Egelbauer has accepted.
- Is that good?

1:18:27.661 --> 1:18:30.205
Say, listen,
I'll guarantee you one thing -

1:18:30.289 --> 1:18:33.750
Let this party be a success, and inside
of two weeks we'll be invited to the Egelbauers.

1:18:33.834 --> 1:18:37.087
I see.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

1:18:37.171 --> 1:18:38.880
Oh, don't talk like that.

1:18:38.964 --> 1:18:42.759
Strump and Egelbauer are figuring on the greatest
publicity campaign in the history of cement.

1:18:42.843 --> 1:18:45.387
Well, what about the Strumps?
Don't we have to invite them too?

1:18:45.471 --> 1:18:48.264
Mr. Strump comes first.
"Strump and Egelbauer."

1:18:48.349 --> 1:18:50.850
No, no, no.
We can't have them at the same time.

1:18:50.935 --> 1:18:52.936
- They're not on speaking terms.
- That's right.

1:18:53.020 --> 1:18:55.397
I forgot about Mr. Strump
and Mrs. Egelbauer.

1:18:55.481 --> 1:18:57.607
Oh, don't mention that!
Don't even breathe it.

1:18:57.691 --> 1:18:59.526
- I won't.
- You promise?

1:18:59.610 --> 1:19:01.444
Promise.

1:19:01.529 --> 1:19:03.446
Word of honor?

1:19:03.531 --> 1:19:05.365
Cross my heart.

1:19:05.449 --> 1:19:07.450
And please don't worry about the Strumps.

1:19:07.535 --> 1:19:09.452
A week from Tuesday
we have the Strumps.

1:19:09.537 --> 1:19:11.454
That's diplomacy.

1:19:11.539 --> 1:19:13.790
And if this Strump party
is a big social success...

1:19:13.874 --> 1:19:15.792
is there any chance
we'll be invited to the Strumps?

1:19:15.876 --> 1:19:18.545
- It's a cinch.
- What a season!

1:19:20.256 --> 1:19:22.507
[Chattering]

1:19:25.428 --> 1:19:29.431
Everybody, please. Everybody who wants to
play Twenty Questions, all in the living room.

1:19:29.515 --> 1:19:31.891
[Excited Murmuring]

1:19:33.769 --> 1:19:36.479
Everybody who wants to play Twenty Questions,
all in the living room.

1:19:36.564 --> 1:19:38.898
- [Excited Murmuring]
- [Woman] Oh, that sounds fun!

1:30:33.386 --> 1:30:37.348
Let's hear, Gilda.
Can you still say "rotten"?

1:30:37.432 --> 1:30:39.683
- Rotten!
- [Tom Laughing]

1:30:39.768 --> 1:30:42.645
Gilda, you gonna criticize us
with that baseball bat of yours?

1:30:42.729 --> 1:30:44.605
Till you say "uncle."

1:30:44.689 --> 1:30:46.357
Ha-ha! Gilda!

1:30:47.734 --> 1:30:49.568
Dear critic!

1:30:52.072 --> 1:30:55.491
But, boys, this is very important.
There's one thing that has to be understood.

1:30:55.575 --> 1:30:57.451
- I know.
- Yes, we know.

1:30:57.536 --> 1:30:59.453
It's a gentleman's agreement.
