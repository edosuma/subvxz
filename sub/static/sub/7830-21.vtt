Lisa, what in the heck

00:49.674 --> 00:51.593
Oh, it's for my junior
achievers club.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.762
We're trying to earn money
by recycling.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.847
Recycling is useless, Lise.

00:55.930 --> 00:58.099
Once the sun burns out,
this planet is doomed.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.060
You're just making sure
we spend our last days

01:00.143 --> 01:01.478
using inferior products.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.021
Well, I think it's a great idea.

01:05.231 --> 01:06.900
Mom! Mom!

01:06.983 --> 01:09.277
You're mixing polyethylene
with polyurethane.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.780
-Marge!
-Well, I'm sorry.

01:11.863 --> 01:13.323
And you have to cut
these up first.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.283
Otherwise, animals
get caught in them.

01:15.366 --> 01:16.910
Only the stupid ones.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.578
I could still use more paper.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.039
Hey, I know where there's
lots of paper.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.835
(laughing)

01:25.919 --> 01:28.421
Dad, you're not supposed
to have fun recycling.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.881
This is serious.

01:29.964 --> 01:32.967
Oh, okay.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.969

01:35.053 --> 01:37.806

What a load of garbage.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.850

Super. Now, let's give
a big Junior Achievers'

01:47.857 --> 01:49.484
welcome
to our guest speaker--

01:49.567 --> 01:51.444
I know he can teach us
a lot about business--

01:51.528 --> 01:53.071
Mr. C. Montgomery burns.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.616
<i>(scattered applause)</i>

01:59.077 --> 02:00.870
I'll keep it short and sweet.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.832
Family, religion, friendship.

02:03.915 --> 02:06.042
These are the three demons
you must slay

02:06.126 --> 02:07.710
if you wish to succeed
in business.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.796
When opportunity knocks,

02:09.879 --> 02:11.464
you don't want to be driving
to the maternity hospital

02:11.548 --> 02:14.008
or sitting in some
phony baloney church.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.719
Or synagogue.
Questions?

02:20.515 --> 02:22.350
Well, uh, I'm going
to take advantage

02:22.433 --> 02:24.018
of this rare opportunity

02:24.102 --> 02:26.354
even if you children
aren't interested.

02:26.437 --> 02:27.689
Which do you think
is more important--

02:27.772 --> 02:30.608
hard work
or stick-to-itiveness?

02:30.692 --> 02:33.236
-Are there any real questions?
-Yes.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.822
Um, does your plant
have a recycling program?

02:35.905 --> 02:39.117
Re-cy-cling?

02:49.544 --> 02:51.296
I'm afraid I'm not familiar
with that term,

02:51.379 --> 02:53.464
you adorable little ragamuffin.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.300
Hmm. You never heard
of recycling?

02:55.383 --> 02:56.759
It means to reuse things

02:56.843 --> 02:58.344
to conserve our natural
resources.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.722
Oh, so Mother Nature
needs a favor.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.016
Well, maybe she should
have thought of that

03:03.099 --> 03:05.143
when she was besetting us with droughts
and floods and poison monkeys.

03:05.226 --> 03:06.936
Nature started the fight
for survival,

03:07.020 --> 03:09.022
and now she wants to quit
because she's losing.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.690
Well, I say-- hard cheese.

03:10.773 --> 03:12.358
But nature's not our enemy.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.485
Well, surely, you agree
we can do without her.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.362
No, I don't agree.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.447
No?

03:17.530 --> 03:19.073
How dare you question Mr. Burns?

03:19.157 --> 03:20.491
I'll handle it, Smithers.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.535
(chuckles)
Shut up, little girl.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.413
If I had spent my life listening
to dismal Doras like you,

03:25.496 --> 03:27.916
I wouldn't be worth
$200 million today.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.084
But according to your
most recent biography,

03:30.168 --> 03:31.961
you only have
$100 million today.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.504
I... I...

03:33.588 --> 03:36.382
(sputters)

03:36.466 --> 03:37.967
Um...

03:38.051 --> 03:39.385
Actually, sir, it's...

03:39.469 --> 03:41.221
considerably less than that.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.184
I, um... have to go.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.520
<i>(clapping alone)</i>

03:49.604 --> 03:50.688
Monty Burns, everybody.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.108
I've called you all here

03:54.192 --> 03:56.152
because I need
some honest answers.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.904
What is my current
financial situation?

03:57.987 --> 03:59.322
-Great.
-Great.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.115
-I hear great.
-All right, well,

04:01.199 --> 04:02.367
let's have a look
at my stock portfolio.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.581
Hmm. Confederated Slaveholdings.
How's that doing?

04:08.665 --> 04:11.709
It's, uh... uh, steady.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.378
I'm sure all your stocks
are doing well, sir.

04:13.461 --> 04:16.047
-After all, you chose them.
-(murmuring approval)

04:16.130 --> 04:18.716
Well, let's get out the old
stock ticker and have a look.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.513
Here's where I stopped
checking it last time--

04:23.596 --> 04:26.766
September, 1929...

04:26.849 --> 04:29.644
Oh, no... Oh, no.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.771
Oh, no.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.232
Smithers, why didn't you tell me
about this market crash?

04:34.315 --> 04:37.986
Um, well, sir, it happened
25 years before I was born.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.029
Oh, that's your excuse
for everything.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.365
I've got to do something
to get my money back quickly.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.325
This calls for an aggressive
trading strategy.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.452
ALL: Good idea, sir.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.788
Take 50% of my money
and put it in the blue chips--

04:48.871 --> 04:50.915
Trans-Atlantic Zeppelin,
Amalgamated Spats,

04:50.999 --> 04:53.668
Congreves Inflammable Powders,
U.S. Hay--

04:53.751 --> 04:55.586
and sink the rest
into that up-and-coming

04:55.670 --> 04:57.422
Baltimore Opera Hat company.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.340
That should set things
right again, eh, boys?

04:59.424 --> 05:00.758
-Absolutely.
-Oh, yes, sir.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.051
Genius. "A" all the way.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.386
Can't go wrong with Congreves.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.937
A half-ton of newspaper,
and all we get is 75 cents?

05:13.021 --> 05:15.565
That won't even cover the gas
I use to go to the store

05:15.648 --> 05:17.442
to buy the twine
to tie up the bundles.

05:17.525 --> 05:20.778
It sounds like
you're working for your car.

05:20.862 --> 05:24.115
Simplify, man.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.575
(muttering)

05:25.658 --> 05:27.702
Sorry, kids,
the trip to Albany is off,

05:27.785 --> 05:30.121
-and there's to be no more recycling.
-(kids protesting)

05:30.204 --> 05:32.248
But we didn't do that badly.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.834
We collected enough paper
to save one whole tree.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.671
(children crying)

05:38.755 --> 05:40.340
CHILD:
Oh, Mommy, help.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.261
Are you saying
my money's all gone?

05:45.345 --> 05:47.555
-ALL: Mm-hmm.
-But...

05:47.638 --> 05:49.390
I made all the right moves,
didn't I?

05:49.474 --> 05:51.351
-Oh, yes, sir.
-Every move a right one.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.854
I see it all now.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.647
You're just a bunch
of yes men.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.191
I was making the wrong moves,

05:58.274 --> 05:59.400
and you were too gutless
to tell me.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.651
Isn't that right?

06:00.735 --> 06:02.403
-Oh, yes, sir.
-Dead on, sir.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.655
Then I'll fix this myself.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.741
Smithers, take out another
mortgage on the plant.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.951
Well, the bank has already
foreclosed on the plant.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.620
And your house, sir.

06:10.703 --> 06:13.915
But... what will I do?

06:13.998 --> 06:15.750
Well, the first thing
you'll have to do

06:15.833 --> 06:17.126
is move out of the bank's house.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.546
-I'll help you pack.
-(whimpers)

06:26.636 --> 06:28.096
(faucet squeaks)

06:28.179 --> 06:30.348
-Go on. Get out of here.
-(birds squawking)

06:36.270 --> 06:38.773
And I'm sure a pro wrestler
such as yourself

06:38.856 --> 06:41.567
will appreciate
all the closet space, Hit Man.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.610
(sniffs)

06:42.693 --> 06:44.320
Ooh...

06:44.404 --> 06:46.364
this place has got
old-man stink.

06:46.447 --> 06:49.325
-Ooh...
-Don't listen to him, sir.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.036
You've got an enchanting musk.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.621
And you wouldn't even be
the only wrestler

06:53.704 --> 06:55.248
in the neighborhood.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.707
The Shrieking Sheik lives
just three doors away.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.584
(distant shrieking)

06:58.668 --> 07:00.378
Hey-hey, I'll take it.

07:04.465 --> 07:09.679
Uh, would it be all right
if I kept this portrait...

07:09.762 --> 07:11.806
to remind me of better times?

07:11.889 --> 07:14.892
Why would I want a picture of
a pitiful pencil-neck geek?

07:14.976 --> 07:15.977
Yeah.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.062
Why, indeed.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.781
I'll make sure he forwards
your social security check, sir.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.408
Mmm. Excellent.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.164
Homer! You didn't tell me
Mr. Burns went broke and lost

07:36.247 --> 07:37.915
the nuclear power plant.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.126
Now, I can't remember
every little thing

07:40.209 --> 07:42.003
that happens in my day.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.255
You told me about that candy
bar you found three times.

07:44.338 --> 07:45.882
You found a candy bar?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.258
Oh, yes.
Gather 'round, my son,

07:47.341 --> 07:49.177
and I shall tell you a tale...

07:49.260 --> 07:51.137
I normally don't laugh
at other people's misfortunes,

07:51.220 --> 07:53.973
but on behalf of
the recycling community...

07:54.056 --> 07:56.809
Ha! It couldn't have happened
to anyone more deserving.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.145
They're not going to close
the plant, are they?

07:59.228 --> 08:01.439
No. The bank
put Lenny in charge.

08:04.609 --> 08:05.693
Uh...

08:05.776 --> 08:07.778
attention, everybody.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.114
Uh...

08:10.198 --> 08:13.242
Uh... work harder. Bye.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.370
-(groans)
-(knuckles crack)

08:19.248 --> 08:20.583
Well, sir,

08:20.666 --> 08:22.126
I have to get to work.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.920
Lenny's a real bear
on tardiness.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.296
Are there any chores I can do?

08:32.261 --> 08:34.388
-(shattering)
-Uh, no, no.

08:34.472 --> 08:38.935
Uh, you just stay here
and maintain your dignity.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.603
(door closes)

08:40.686 --> 08:45.149
(water dripping)

08:45.233 --> 08:47.693
Ah. Here's a chance
to earn my keep.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.278
I will go out
and get these items

08:49.362 --> 08:50.488
from the food jobber.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.284
Grocery store, please.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.166
I am riding on the bus.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.795
Hey, aren't you that
guy everybody hates?

09:05.878 --> 09:08.422
Oh, my, no.
I'm Monty Burns.

09:12.426 --> 09:13.511
I'm shopping.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.766
Oh, my.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.226
I wonder which is the cereal
for me?

09:22.228 --> 09:24.188
Um, oh, excuse me.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.440
Could you tell me where
I might find the "Burns O's"?

09:26.524 --> 09:28.734
Sorry, pops,
they don't put nobodies

09:28.818 --> 09:30.736
on cereal boxes.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.446
Hmm...

09:32.530 --> 09:36.033
well, I suppose
this one looks a bit like me.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.748
Whoo. Thank you, shoppie.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.333
I ventured
in to search for milk

09:44.417 --> 09:46.335
when the door
snapped shut behind me.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.255
Yeah, those dairy cases
are death traps.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.173
Ketchup.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.883
Catsup.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.094
Ketchup.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.304
Catsup.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.265
Catsup.

09:59.348 --> 10:02.059
Huh. I'm in way over my head.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.020
He's, uh, talking
to the ketchup now.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.396
Burns is sure acting nutty.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.273
Maybe going broke
and losing his plant

10:07.356 --> 10:09.650
destroyed his brain.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.111
Could you come
along with us, sir?

10:12.194 --> 10:15.031
Are you here
to solve my ketchup problem?

10:15.114 --> 10:16.282
Yes, that's right.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.997
Where are you taking me?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.498
What's happening?

10:24.582 --> 10:26.250
Relax. You've gone off
your nut,

10:26.334 --> 10:28.502
so we're stuffing you
into an old folks home.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.255
Those, uh, store guys signed
the commitment papers.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.923
But... I'm shopping.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.134
(Homer glugging)

10:37.386 --> 10:39.221
Here you go, honey.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.307
That's about all
the recycling--

10:41.390 --> 10:43.142
(hiccups)
...I can handle today.

10:43.225 --> 10:44.393
Dad, if you just
drink one more,

10:44.477 --> 10:46.312
I'll have a full bag.

10:46.395 --> 10:49.357
Oh, but Daddy
doesn't feel so good.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.858
Uh... there's got to be

10:50.941 --> 10:52.735
more trash around
here somewhere.

10:52.818 --> 10:56.405
Hey, why don't you try
the old folks home?

10:56.489 --> 10:59.158
They practically live
in their own filth.

10:59.241 --> 11:00.409
Thanks, Dad.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.161
You're welcome, honey.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.913
That's the activity room.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.248
We're not allowed in there.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.543
That's the library.
Not allowed in there either.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.837
And don't even think about
going in the game room.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.757
Egad, man, how are we
supposed to pass the time?

11:14.840 --> 11:17.468
Best bet is to stake
yourself out a good spot

11:17.551 --> 11:19.345
at the staring window.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.057
(shudders)

11:23.140 --> 11:25.101
<i>♪ Don't tell my heart ♪</i>

11:25.184 --> 11:26.936
<i>♪ My achy-breaky heart ♪</i>

11:27.019 --> 11:31.148
<i>♪ I just don't think</i>
<i>it understands ♪</i>

11:31.232 --> 11:33.693
Come on, Mr. Burns,
join the fun!

11:35.945 --> 11:37.488
That's the spirit.

11:39.865 --> 11:43.744
So, this is how
the Monty Burns saga ends.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.955
Oh, if I hadn't
surrounded myself

11:46.038 --> 11:47.832
with those spineless yes men...

11:47.915 --> 11:50.209
LISA: What do you mean
you don't have anything to recycle?

11:50.292 --> 11:52.378
You must have some magazines
or newspapers.

11:52.461 --> 11:55.214
That voice. That shrill,
disagreeable voice.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.799
It's her!

11:56.882 --> 11:59.510
Sorry, we're not allowed
to read newspapers.

11:59.593 --> 12:01.721
They angry up the blood.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.389
You! The troublemaking girl!

12:03.472 --> 12:06.559
My name is Lisa, Mr. Burns.
Lisa Simpson.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.602
It doesn't matter,
what your name is, you idiot.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.771
What I want to know is, will you
help me get my money back?

12:10.855 --> 12:14.066
Ha. I'd never help you.
You're the worst man in the world.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.569
Yes. That's the kind of
moxie I'm looking for!

12:16.652 --> 12:18.821
-You're hired!
-No, I'm not!

12:18.904 --> 12:21.365
Sir, I'm so sorry
my grocer committed you.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.783
We'll never shop
there again.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.118
Not now, Smithers.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.786
I've got an empire to rebuild.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.788
And the person
who's going to help me is...

12:27.872 --> 12:29.165
that girl.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.542
<i>("That Girl" theme playing)</i>

12:35.212 --> 12:36.422
-Please.
-No.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.555
Please.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.849
No.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.603
-Please.
-No.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.564
(doorbell ringing)

12:55.900 --> 12:58.903
Sir, we've never met before,
but my name is Mr. Burns,

12:58.986 --> 13:01.572
and I want your daughter
to help make me rich again.

13:01.655 --> 13:02.740
You mean Maggie?

13:05.326 --> 13:06.827
Ah, the baby who shot me.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.413
No, I was referring
to your other daughter.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.833
Lisa, you have a guest.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.960
So, uh...

13:15.044 --> 13:16.837
How's life in the gutter?

13:16.921 --> 13:19.715
You again?

13:19.799 --> 13:22.259
I've realized the error
of my ways, Lisa.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.136
I need someone with
your integrity to help me.

13:24.220 --> 13:28.557
Please?
Don't refuse this poor old man.

13:31.435 --> 13:32.812
Uh...

13:32.895 --> 13:34.980
well...

13:35.064 --> 13:36.732
if I did agree to help you,
you could only earn money

13:36.816 --> 13:39.235
by doing good,
socially responsible things.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.862
-Nothing evil.
-"Nothing evil."

13:41.946 --> 13:44.865
That's exactly the kind
of radical thinking I need.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.909
It's a deal.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.746
See that, boy?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.873
Why aren't you making
any business deals?

13:52.957 --> 13:55.042
(whining):
I'll do it this afternoon.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.423
You mean there
are actually people

14:01.507 --> 14:03.592
who will pay good
money for garbage?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.219
Not good money, really.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.054
Each can will get you a nickel.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.139
Oh, don't pooh-pooh
a nickel, Lisa.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.475
A nickel will buy you
a steak and kidney pie,

14:11.559 --> 14:12.977
a cup of coffee,
a slice of cheesecake,

14:13.060 --> 14:14.728
and a newsreel,

14:14.812 --> 14:16.730
with enough change left over
to ride the trolley

14:16.814 --> 14:19.608
from Battery Park
to the polo grounds.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.151
There's a can.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.740
You have to cut
these six-pack holders up.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.576
Otherwise,
fish get trapped in them.

14:28.659 --> 14:29.994
I see.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.040
Ha-ha!

14:49.597 --> 14:52.892
My first dollar.
Thanks to you, Lisa

14:52.975 --> 14:54.768
and our hemp-smoking friend.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.146
Shine on, you crazy diamond.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.524
Sounds like somebody's living
in the past.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.943
Contemporize, man.

15:03.027 --> 15:06.572
Well, Lisa, as my advisor,
you're entitled to 10%.

15:06.655 --> 15:09.199
Oh, I'm not doing this
for the money.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.660
I'm just happy knowing
that future generations

15:11.744 --> 15:13.537
will enjoy unspoiled
median strips

15:13.621 --> 15:15.915
and pristine
highway embankments.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.750
There's a can.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.836
<i>And from our "it's funny</i>
<i>when it happens to them" file,</i>

15:20.920 --> 15:23.255

<i>-Excellent.</i>

15:40.064 --> 15:41.607

15:47.738 --> 15:49.740
Wow, he went
from stinking rich

15:49.823 --> 15:51.450
to just plain stinking.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.786
(laughing)

15:53.869 --> 15:56.538
-Good one, Mom.
-Oh, you're so bad, honey.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.207
You guys shouldn't
laugh at him.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.626
Mr. Burns has changed.
He's different now.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.754
-Yeah, he's broke.
-(laughing)

16:03.837 --> 16:05.005
Two in a row.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.674
(sighing)

16:14.098 --> 16:15.891
Oh, you've really
turned my life around

16:15.975 --> 16:17.559
these past few weeks, Lisa.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.104
I've got my own business again,
my beloved employees.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.606
Oh, consarn it...

16:22.690 --> 16:26.068
Come on, let's pick up the pace,
you neglected old nincompoops.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.820
Mr. Burns, if you want people
to do a good job,

16:27.903 --> 16:29.488
you can't bully them.

16:29.571 --> 16:30.990
You have to show them
they're appreciated.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.242
Ooh, capital idea,
partner.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.703
People, if we meet
this week's quota,

16:35.786 --> 16:37.371
I'll take you
to the most duck-filled pond

16:37.454 --> 16:39.206
you ever sat by.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.874
Oh, hot diggity,
that's how they got me

16:40.958 --> 16:42.334
to vote for Lyndon Larouche.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.923
Wow, even I didn't know

16:48.007 --> 16:49.550
he was so committed
to recycling.

16:49.633 --> 16:53.012
See? I told you Mr. Burns
has changed. See?

16:53.095 --> 16:55.139
Lisa, nobody likes a gloater.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.724
-Right, Homey?
-Uh-huh.

16:56.807 --> 16:57.808
See?

16:57.891 --> 17:00.477
(applause)

17:00.561 --> 17:01.979
Yes, thank you, everyone.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.231
But 10% of your applause
should go to

17:04.314 --> 17:05.858
my little partner,
Lisa Simpson.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.694
For, if it were not for her
infectious moralizing,

17:08.777 --> 17:11.613
we would not be here today
to witness the unveiling of--

17:11.697 --> 17:14.366
the Li'l Lisa Recycling Plant.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.577
(applause)

17:16.660 --> 17:18.495
Oh, ain't that cute?

17:18.579 --> 17:21.248
Makes Little Debbie
look like a pile of puke.

17:21.331 --> 17:22.750
Would you like to be the first

17:22.833 --> 17:24.293
to take a tour of the plant,
Li'l Lisa?

17:24.376 --> 17:27.588
I'd love to, partner.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.923
The whole plant
is environmentally sound.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.092
It's powered by old newspapers.

17:32.176 --> 17:35.345
The machinery is made entirely
of used cans, and the windows

17:35.429 --> 17:38.432
are from the old liquor bottles
we collected.

17:38.515 --> 17:41.894
Hey, I thought I told you
to stop licking my windows.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.104
I know, you told me...

17:44.188 --> 17:46.273
and when I woke up
this morning, I said,

17:46.356 --> 17:48.942
"Barney, you're not going
to lick that man's..."

17:49.026 --> 17:50.944
I'm so proud
of you, Mr. Burns.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.738
You're getting
your fortune back,

17:52.821 --> 17:54.406
and you're doing it
without endangering the planet

17:54.490 --> 17:56.533
or cozying up
to the Aspen crowd.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.620
Oh, hold your accolades
till the end of the tour.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.246
You haven't seen
the best part.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.040
I couldn't watch
your demonstration

18:03.123 --> 18:04.875
of the fish caught
in the plastic rings

18:04.958 --> 18:06.877
without getting an idea.

18:06.960 --> 18:07.878
Look out over the water.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.928
I figured if one six-pack holder
will catch one fish,

18:16.011 --> 18:19.598
a million sewn together
will catch a million fish.

18:19.681 --> 18:20.724
Watch.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.852
What's going on?

18:23.936 --> 18:26.522
Ah, I call it
the "Burns Omni-Net."

18:26.605 --> 18:28.941
it sweeps the sea clean.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.067
(gasps)

18:38.408 --> 18:39.576
Oh, dear God.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.953
BURNS:
I call our product

18:41.036 --> 18:42.955
"Li'l Lisa's
Patented Animal Slurry."

18:43.038 --> 18:45.165
it's a high-protein feed
for farm animals,

18:45.249 --> 18:46.792
insulation
for low-income housing,

18:46.875 --> 18:48.418
a powerful explosive,

18:48.502 --> 18:50.129
and a top-notch
engine coolant.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.755
And best of all,

18:51.839 --> 18:54.925
it's made from 100 percent
recycled animals.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.177
Oh, I think
I'm going to be sick.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.764
Oh, a spoonful of slurry
will cure what ails you.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.225
Ah! You haven't changed at all.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.602
You're still evil,
and when you're trying

19:05.686 --> 19:07.479
to be good,
you're even more evil.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.565
I don't understand.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.067
Pigs needs food,
engines need coolant,

19:12.151 --> 19:13.986
dynamiters need dynamite.

19:14.069 --> 19:16.446
I'm supplying it to them
at a tidy profit,

19:16.530 --> 19:18.782
and not a single
sea creature was wasted.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.702
You inspired it all,
Li'l Lisa.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.960
Stop! Don't recycle!

19:30.043 --> 19:32.838
It's murder!
You're helping Mr. Burns!

19:32.921 --> 19:35.883
(robotic monotone)
But you told us to recycle.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.010
You convinced us
it was good.

19:38.093 --> 19:41.889
No, it's evil!
Please, stop recycling!

19:44.474 --> 19:48.812
(robotic monotones) Stop.
You can't mix plastic with paper.

19:51.690 --> 19:55.194
(gasps)
Oh! Oh!

19:55.277 --> 19:57.154
(tires screech)

20:00.449 --> 20:02.242
(sobbing)

20:02.326 --> 20:06.246
Oh, I can't get the smell
of slurry out of my clothes.

20:06.330 --> 20:10.083
I was a fool to help
that horrible old man.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.586
I hope you learned
your lesson, Lisa.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.588
Never help anyone.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.173
(doorbell ringing)

20:20.260 --> 20:21.845
Simpson, what are you
doing here?

20:21.929 --> 20:23.889
-Why aren't you at work?
-I made a bad mistake,

20:23.972 --> 20:26.016
and Lenny sent me home
to think about what I did.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.310
But I don't remember what it was,
so I'm watching TV.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.854
Well, Lenny's reign
of terror is over.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.689
Mr. Burns bought
the plant back this morning.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.483
-And--
-Enough chitchat. I need to see Lisa.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.485
I don't want to talk to you,
Mr. Burns.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.195
Oh, I think you will.

20:38.278 --> 20:41.323
You see, I just sold
the Li'l Lisa Recycling Plant

20:41.406 --> 20:44.243
for $120 million.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.661
Congratulations.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.079
Oh, don't congratulate me.

20:47.162 --> 20:49.414
Congratulate
Bay State Fish Sticks.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.333
As my advisor,
you're entitled

20:51.416 --> 20:52.626
to 10% of the proceeds.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.461
(gasping)

20:54.544 --> 20:57.923
Lise, have I told you lately
that I love you?

20:58.006 --> 21:02.135
Wow! I've never seen
so much money.

21:02.219 --> 21:05.097
Oh, but I can't accept that,

21:05.180 --> 21:07.557
knowing where it came from.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.309
Can I, Mom?

21:09.393 --> 21:11.144
(groaning)

21:11.228 --> 21:14.731
Lisa, you do whatever
your conscience tells you.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.234
(groans)

21:20.737 --> 21:22.322
No...

21:22.406 --> 21:25.284
Oh, you did the right thing,
sweetheart.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.579
(chuckling)

21:29.663 --> 21:31.331
Well, that's the first case
I've ever seen

21:31.415 --> 21:34.668
of a man suffering four
simultaneous heart attacks.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.753
I'm sorry, Dad.

21:36.837 --> 21:40.090
It's all right.
I understand.

21:40.173 --> 21:43.385
But we really could have used
that $12,000.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.720
Um... Dad,

21:44.803 --> 21:47.055
10% of $120 million

21:47.139 --> 21:50.267
isn't 12,000, it's...

21:50.350 --> 21:53.186
