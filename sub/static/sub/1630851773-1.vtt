WEBVTT

00:09.680 --> 00:11.280
I don't think so, do you?

00:12.320 --> 00:14.800
It's only 29.99.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.320
Yeah, but where will you wear it?

00:16.320 --> 00:19.360
You never do anything except go
to school or study.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.880
Yeah. I've got library books that
have been out more than me.

00:22.880 --> 00:23.920
Exactly.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.200
I mean, why waste your money

00:25.200 --> 00:27.400
on something
that will never get worn, darling?

00:28.880 --> 00:30.640
OK, let's go.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.520
I have to pick up
your dad's athlete's foot powder.

00:33.520 --> 00:36.480
I'd hate to miss that,
but can I meet you at the car?

00:36.480 --> 00:37.720
All right, but don't be long.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.960
I've only got ten minutes left
on the parking.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.880
Excuse me, miss.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.320
I need to look in your bag.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.200
Why?

00:59.200 --> 01:01.280
Can I look in your bag, please?

01:08.320 --> 01:10.400
We've got a runner, boys.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.520
Sorry. Sorry!

01:17.480 --> 01:20.640
♪ Love is a burning thing

01:20.640 --> 01:24.640

01:29.120 --> 01:32.720

02:01.880 --> 02:03.200
Rani?

02:06.200 --> 02:07.800
What's going on?

02:51.480 --> 02:53.800
Do you remember what's special
about today, sweetie?

02:53.800 --> 02:55.600
Um, Grampa's coming to stay?

02:55.600 --> 02:56.840
That's right.

02:56.840 --> 03:00.680
Grandpa is funny and charming and
you're gonna like him very much.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.960
But I do need you to remember
one thing while he's here.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.680
I need you to remember that
Grandpa is a lying, thieving,

03:06.680 --> 03:08.360
selfish old bastard.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.880
Good luck. Cheers, mate.
Good luck, bro.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.520
And what is Grandpa?

03:15.440 --> 03:18.160
A lying, thieving,
selfish old bastard.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.440
Who can...?
Who can never be trusted.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.960
Good girl.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.800
Safe travels, Frank.

03:40.320 --> 03:45.160
Greetings and felicitations.
Margie, did you change your hair?

03:45.160 --> 03:46.240
Quite possibly, Frank,

03:46.240 --> 03:48.000
in the eight years
since I last saw you.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.880
This young buck must be Tom.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.680
Hey, dude, what's happening?

03:51.680 --> 03:55.640
Lord, oh, Lord,
who's this beautiful princess?

03:55.640 --> 03:57.040
Holly.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.920
Oh, what a pleasure.

03:58.920 --> 04:00.960
Where are we setting up, please?

04:00.960 --> 04:05.280
Between the hours of 7pm and 6am,
you will remain in this residence

04:05.280 --> 04:07.000
and the light will remain green.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.880
If you travel more than two metres
from this residence,

04:08.880 --> 04:10.360
the light turns red.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.440
Is that clear?

04:11.440 --> 04:13.520
Crystal. What happens
if it turns red?

04:13.520 --> 04:15.000
You get a little visit
from the police.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.240
Ooh.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.800
I'll show myself out.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.440
Thank you for your service.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.920
Why were you in prison?

04:22.920 --> 04:24.680
It was a misunderstanding.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.560
Grandpa misunderstood that you can't
forge signatures on cheques.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.920
Oooh... Ah!

04:31.000 --> 04:32.200
What's a cheque?

04:37.960 --> 04:41.680
All right, yep, yep. I do.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.440
Can I speak? Thank you.
I'm asking for two poxy weeks.

04:44.440 --> 04:45.480
No phones allowed. What?

04:45.480 --> 04:47.360
Back through the machine.
Empty your pockets.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.040
All right, Captain, slow down.
Just a middle-aged white man.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.040
All I'm carrying are keys
and unwanted back fat.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.280
No, listen, no.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.280
The Chinese deal is going through.
No phones allowed.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.920
What? No phones allowed.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.040
No phones allowed.
I have to call you back.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.680
And the bag. And the bag!

05:02.680 --> 05:07.320
Listen, I'm a businessman
from Bristol, not a jihadi bride.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.560
Are you wearing a belt?

05:10.560 --> 05:11.600
I am wearing a belt.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.040
Yes, I like it
when my trousers stay up. That OK?

05:15.280 --> 05:17.960
Thank you.
Where am I going please?

05:28.800 --> 05:32.040
Be careful, darling.
Just do whatever they tell you.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.480
This way.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.840
Hi there. I'm Greg.

06:27.840 --> 06:31.920
I'm 6'7" tall
and, no, it's not in proportion.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.400
If it was in proportion,
I'd be 8'3".

06:42.160 --> 06:45.280
Greetings and felicitations.
High pockets!

06:45.280 --> 06:47.040
What's tickin', chicken?

06:47.040 --> 06:50.160
Uh, it's finger-lickin', chicken.

06:50.160 --> 06:54.240
Good morning, ladies. Can I just
say? You're both looking beautiful.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.720
No, you can't.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.200
He can't tell you
that you're beautiful?

06:57.200 --> 06:59.440
We didn't ask him
for a verdict on our appearance.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.520
Sorry, but I say it like I find it.

07:01.520 --> 07:05.240
And, ladies, you're both
a right couple of swooners.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.720
Attention! Sit.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.520
Some people...

07:13.520 --> 07:17.240
..think that Community Payback
is an easy option.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.320
A soft touch.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.520
Newsflash -

07:21.520 --> 07:23.040
it ain't.

07:23.040 --> 07:27.040
You will repay your debt to society
by working the number of hours

07:27.040 --> 07:29.280
mandated by the court.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.480
My name is Diane Pemberley.
I'm your supervisor.

07:32.480 --> 07:37.160
And I can be a good guy...or
a mean bastard.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.680
Your choice.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.920
Good guy, please. You don't choose.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.840
You said it was our choice.
It was a figure of speech.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.200
It wasn't entirely clear.
Are you a trouble-maker?

07:45.200 --> 07:47.160
No, ma'am. Definitely not.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.440
When I call your name, say here.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.520
John Halloran.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.160
Here. Shouldn't be.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.280
Frank Sheldon?

07:54.280 --> 07:55.680
What's the agenda, Brenda?

07:55.680 --> 07:56.880
Christian Taylor.

07:56.880 --> 08:00.200
Yo. OK, what are you people not
getting? Just say here.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.560
Myrna Okeke.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.720
Here in body, not in spirit.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.680
I don't know what that means.
Gregory Dillard?

08:06.680 --> 08:07.880
Yeah, that's me.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.720
Can I just apologise
for the inappropriate joke

08:09.720 --> 08:12.000
earlier about things
being in proportion?

08:12.000 --> 08:16.160
To be honest, it's not even that
long. Although it is quite flat.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.400
Like a kipper.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.080
Just say here.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.400
Yeah, here. Yeah. Here.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.240
Rani Rekowski?

08:22.240 --> 08:24.160
Here. Thank you.

08:53.560 --> 08:59.280
You each have
over 100 hours to serve.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.800
You have been tasked

09:01.800 --> 09:05.400
with restoring this
into a community centre

09:05.400 --> 09:08.160
for the local...community.

09:09.160 --> 09:12.200
You will work four hours
each visit.

09:12.200 --> 09:16.160
Only when I am happy
with the work you have done

09:16.160 --> 09:18.760
will I log those four hours.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.080
Take another one.

09:20.080 --> 09:21.520
During clean-up duty,

09:21.520 --> 09:26.760
if you find a deceased animal
over 10k,

09:26.760 --> 09:28.960
do not touch it.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.600
That is the council's business.

09:31.600 --> 09:37.360
Anything under 10k -
vermin, cats, a small dog -

09:37.360 --> 09:38.960
that is yours.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.840
Can we keep it? No, you may not.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.520
Now, you may be wondering
about faeces.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.240
You read my mind.

09:45.240 --> 09:49.480
If you find human faeces,
do not touch it.

09:49.480 --> 09:53.400
You may handle
other species' faeces.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.760
Can we keep it?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.400
No, you may not.

09:56.400 --> 10:02.080
You are here for the next four
hours, people. You may begin!

10:14.600 --> 10:15.920
So, why're you here?

10:17.120 --> 10:20.000
Uh, oh, well, I'm here
because, uh,

10:20.000 --> 10:21.960
even though I run
a successful company

10:21.960 --> 10:24.240
making brake pads, pay my taxes,

10:24.240 --> 10:26.160
employ 52 people,

10:26.160 --> 10:29.560
we have a criminal justice system
that kowtows to the, uh,

10:29.560 --> 10:31.360
right-on leftie liberal brigade.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.960
I'm a right-on leftie liberal.
Are you sure?

10:33.960 --> 10:36.520
Seems like you can't really call
yourself a leftie these days

10:36.520 --> 10:39.200
unless you're a disabled
transgender vegan

10:39.200 --> 10:42.120
with a nut allergy
who makes their own soap.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.520
Are you reading that
straight off the Daily Mail website?

10:44.520 --> 10:46.120
Well, they're not wrong
about everything.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.080
I'm just saying, you watch yourself.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.840
Nothing the lefties like more
than eating their own.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.520
Unless they contain nuts.

10:58.280 --> 10:59.600
You're working too hard.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.120
You think it matters
if we clear this crap up or not?

11:02.120 --> 11:03.840
They just want to give us
something to do.

11:03.840 --> 11:07.120
I'd slow down if I were you.
You might burn yourself out.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.200
Also, you're making me look bad.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.440
What are you in for?

11:16.440 --> 11:18.120
I stole some stuff.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.640
Why would someone proper-smart
be stealing stuff?

11:20.640 --> 11:22.200
Who says I'm proper-smart?

11:22.200 --> 11:25.000
Well, I saw your bag
and it said Oxford University.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.960
My mum bought that when I went
to interview at Oxford University.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.600
Did you get in?

11:30.600 --> 11:33.600
Well, yeah,
but I'm not proper-smart.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.960
I just have parents who never bought
me a toy that wasn't educational.

11:36.960 --> 11:41.360
Oy, Miss Rekowski.
Less flirting, more exerting.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.960
No, I'm not flirting. I'm not.

11:43.960 --> 11:47.000
I wasn't flirting.
She weren't flirting. I was.

11:48.520 --> 11:49.560
Sorry.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.320
What's wrong?

12:12.400 --> 12:14.640
Hi, Gabby. Look this way.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.840
All right, Gabby?

12:16.840 --> 12:18.000
Hi, Gabby.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.360
Look at me, Gabby.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.640
Nice to see you again.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.200
Whoa! If I was 30 years younger...

12:28.200 --> 12:30.520
You'd still be twice her age.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.840
Thank you.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.240
Did you know? On Twitter,
everyone's been debating

12:35.240 --> 12:36.400
who you were gonna wear today.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.600
Today is about me learning
from my mistakes,

12:38.600 --> 12:40.480
and people are worrying
about what I'm wearing?

12:40.480 --> 12:41.600
That is sick.

12:41.600 --> 12:42.840
Who are you wearing?

12:42.840 --> 12:44.800
It's a Stella McCartney.
The Vampire's Wife.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.440
And shoes are Isabel Marant.

12:46.440 --> 12:47.520
Lovely.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.960
Am I supposed to know who she is?

12:48.960 --> 12:50.920
That's Lady Gabriella Penrose-Howe.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.080
She was on that reality show
where posh people have to give up

12:53.080 --> 12:54.680
their mobile phones
and their assistants.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.080
It was called No Service.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.360
I don't own a TV.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.120
Too busy making vegan soap?

12:59.120 --> 13:01.960
No. Too busy reading books.
You should try it.

13:01.960 --> 13:05.120
I read books. Yeah?
Any that aren't about the SAS?

13:05.120 --> 13:08.400
Hi. Hi, friends. I'm Gabby. Hi.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.520
Hi! Hi, I'm Lady Gabby.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.960
My preferred pronouns
are she, her and herself.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.600
I'm John. Bloke.

13:15.600 --> 13:16.920
I'm so sorry I'm late.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.480
I'm in charge here!

13:19.480 --> 13:22.320
Seriously?
Sorry, that came out wrong.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.800
Yeah, it did come out wrong. Gabby!

13:23.800 --> 13:25.200
They can't be here. Look this way.

13:25.200 --> 13:30.120
You can't be here! Go! Go!
Private property! Back! Scram!

13:31.760 --> 13:33.200
What are you wearing?

13:33.200 --> 13:34.880
Oh, it's Stella McCartney.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.920
This is a Vampire's Wife
and shoes are Isabel Marant.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.720
Thanks for asking. No, I don't mean,
"Ooh, what are you wearing?"

13:39.720 --> 13:41.640
cos I'm interested, I mean,
"What are you wearing?!"

13:41.640 --> 13:42.840
That is not appropriate.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.480
Put this on.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.200
Do I have to?
Yeah, it's not a fashion show.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.800
You're here
because you committed a crime.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.520
The person who designed this
committed the crime.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.560
I mean, someone call
the fashion police. Am I right?

13:55.560 --> 13:57.880
No, you're not right,
Michael McIntyre.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.920
I'm docking you two hours
for being late.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.720
Do you want another two
for being a smart-aleck?

14:01.720 --> 14:04.040
No. Right answer.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.680
Toilet breaks at my discretion.

14:05.680 --> 14:06.920
Any questions?

14:06.920 --> 14:08.360
Yeah, what is this?

14:08.360 --> 14:09.720
Hoe.

14:09.720 --> 14:10.920
Excuse me?

14:14.160 --> 14:17.200
Yo. Respect.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.840
What is that?

14:18.840 --> 14:21.800
It's a...it's a gang sign.
You're not...?

14:21.800 --> 14:25.480
No, it's Mr Spock's Vulcan salute
from Star Trek.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.800
I don't think so.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.920
Yeah, it is.

14:31.880 --> 14:34.200
Oh, yeah, that...
What am I thinking of, then?

14:34.200 --> 14:35.600
What gang was you trying to rep?

14:35.600 --> 14:38.520
West Side, please.
Dre, Tupac, Snoop, that whole crew.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.880
Oh, here. I got you.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.280
Here you go. Like that.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.800
Oh, yeah, yeah. Good.
Maximum respect.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.680
Rekowski! Walk with me.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.800
Well, live long and prosper.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.600
What a nerd.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.800
So, your mum spoke to me.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.880
Said you have a scholarship...

15:13.880 --> 15:15.680
..to Oxford University.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.400
Yeah, sorry about that.
She does tell everyone.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.360
Must be a pretty smart doughnut.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.120
Don't you mean "smart cookie"?

15:23.120 --> 15:24.600
They both work.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.800
Yeah,
I know all about higher education.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.800
I'm gonna apply to become
a police officer,

15:28.800 --> 15:30.640
and education helps with that.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.920
So I'm actually studying
for a degree myself.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.760
Oh, really, where are you studying?

15:34.760 --> 15:36.800
Have you heard of QuickieDegree.com?

15:36.800 --> 15:39.280
Yeah, I get the ads
in my spam folder.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.720
Oh.

15:40.720 --> 15:44.200
Your mum said Oxford's threatening
to revoke your scholarship.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.560
They haven't made a final decision.

15:46.560 --> 15:49.040
Apparently, they want you to get
three As in your A-Levels

15:49.040 --> 15:52.120
and a letter of commendation
from your supervisor.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.000
Guess who that is?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.360
Is it you?

15:56.360 --> 15:58.800
As I said, you're a smart doughnut.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.480
Cookie. They both work.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.160
I'll expect you to work hard.
Show remorse.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.920
Prove that you can learn
from your mistakes. I will.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.240
And I need you.

16:09.240 --> 16:10.800
You need me?

16:10.800 --> 16:12.920
To be my eyes and ears.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.600
Keep me posted on what's being said
and done behind my back.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.480
I don't feel comfortable snitching.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.400
Oh, no, don't think of it
as snitching.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.000
Think of it as collaborating.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.240
That sounds worse.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.920
Only cps it has connotations
with the Nazis.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.240
Yeah, that might be it.

16:25.240 --> 16:29.840
Your future depends on whether
or not I write that commendation.

16:30.760 --> 16:34.600
You need my help, I need yours.
Quid pro quo.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.200
Do we have a deal?

16:38.280 --> 16:43.520
As I said, I can be a good guy
or I can be a mean bastard.

16:43.520 --> 16:44.960
Your choice.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.720
Good girl.

16:58.640 --> 17:02.120
This must be a mistake, sir.
Rani's not a thief.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.480
Tell him your news. Go on.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.520
Mum, he doesn't care. Tell him.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.400
I got accepted
into Oxford University.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.240
With a full scholarship.
Why do you always leave that out?

17:11.240 --> 17:14.680
So, you see, sir, my daughter
is a genius, not a thief.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.840
What is going on?

17:23.920 --> 17:27.520
Is this the first time you've taken
something without paying, Rani?

17:27.520 --> 17:29.080
Yes.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.480
How many of these
do you want to watch?

17:47.480 --> 17:48.920
How many are there?

18:05.800 --> 18:09.280
All the hard work you've done
just thrown away. For what?

18:09.280 --> 18:12.640
Some sequined purses and miniskirts?

18:16.360 --> 18:18.000
It's so humiliating.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.160
Jerzy, are you going
to say anything?

18:22.440 --> 18:26.920
If you lie, cheat or steal again...

18:28.960 --> 18:31.080
..there is no place for you
in this family.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.520
Jerzy, I didn't mean...

18:34.520 --> 18:35.760
You wanted me to talk, I'm talking.

18:37.560 --> 18:41.640
If you get so much as a parking
ticket from this moment on,

18:41.640 --> 18:43.160
you are dead to us.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.920
Rekowski!

18:45.920 --> 18:47.200
We have to go in now.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.320
Come on.

19:08.360 --> 19:11.440
Hey, can you take my picture
for Instagram?

19:11.440 --> 19:13.320
What did your last servant die of?

19:14.520 --> 19:15.960
I think it was just old age.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.880
You have actual servants?

19:17.880 --> 19:20.680
Daddy does, yeah, but you can't
call them servants any more.

19:20.680 --> 19:24.200
They prefer "staff".
Will you take my picture, please?

19:24.200 --> 19:26.720
Why do you want a picture
of this dump? For my followers.

19:26.720 --> 19:29.000
You have followers?
What, like Jesus?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.520
Oh, no, I'm not like Jesus.
He only had 12.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.320
I've got 1.2 million.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.960
No, look, I do understand
what you're saying.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.880
And we've been banking
with you since 1980.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.520
It's like a couple
of little hiccups,

19:40.520 --> 19:43.120
and "Thank you for 40 years
of business, now piss off."

19:43.120 --> 19:44.520
Oy! No phones.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.800
Yes, one second, please.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.040
I'm just trying to keep a roof
over my kid's heads.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.840
I'm meeting with the Chinese today
and I will make them sign.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.920
Give me your phone. Just go away.
How about that?

19:52.920 --> 19:55.720
OK? I need two weeks
for the money to come through.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.880
The Chinese will sign.
The Chinese will sign.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.960
Thank you very much indeed.
Three, two, one. There you go.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.240
Thank you so much.
No more calls. You're here to work.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.520
That was work! OK?

20:04.520 --> 20:06.400
This is detention.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.880
Have you ever have Chinese wine?
What?

20:11.880 --> 20:15.920
If you do business with the Chinese,
they'll want to drink with you.

20:15.920 --> 20:20.120
Makes them feel they can trust you.
Chinese call it guanxi.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.360
Well, thank you for that advice,
Confucius.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.360
Do you want to get back
to shovelling shit?

20:24.360 --> 20:27.440
Be warned, though, if they bring out
the ol' Chinese wine

20:27.440 --> 20:29.720
cos that neck oil is lethal.

20:29.720 --> 20:33.800
When I was in Beijing, I knew
a tiny Chinaman who'd drink me

20:33.800 --> 20:35.040
under the table.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.640
We don't say "Chinaman" nowadays.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.800
The political correctness brigade
have ruled

20:39.800 --> 20:41.360
you can't say Chinaman any more.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.680
You can still say Englishman,
Irishman and Scotsman, though,

20:43.680 --> 20:45.040
so at least our jokes are safe.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.520
Oh, bless.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.600
I know you white blokes have had it
good since the Bronze Age

20:49.600 --> 20:51.840
and the last couple of years might
have been a bit confusing,

20:51.840 --> 20:55.160
but if you find yourself thinking,
"Is this offensive?"

20:55.160 --> 20:58.280
just assume that it is
and go about your business.

20:58.280 --> 21:01.200
Oy! Are you lot working
over there or gassing?

21:01.200 --> 21:05.960
We're working, boss! Harder than
a prostitute with two mattresses.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.600
I think it's too risky.

21:19.600 --> 21:20.920
Me too.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.520
No-one asked your opinion, bruv.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.440
Yeah, it's risky,
but do we got another play?

21:27.440 --> 21:30.000
Say the word
and I'll do it right now.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.080
No, no, not yet.
We need more leverage first.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.800
I went to this epic music festival
in Goa

21:41.800 --> 21:44.520
called the Festival
of Peace and Light. Have you been?

21:44.520 --> 21:46.040
No.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.760
Just...fantastic.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.920
Mm, want some?

21:53.920 --> 21:55.240
No, no, no.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.280
Hey, bruv. You want some piff?
It's high grade.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.960
Thanks, but I'm good for piff.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.520
The Festival of Peace and Light
actually inspired me

22:04.520 --> 22:06.920
to organise a music festival
of my own.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.640
Like Glastonbury?

22:08.640 --> 22:10.200
Less muddy, more magical.

22:10.200 --> 22:13.040
So, there's gonna be luxury yurts,
regular yurts, slam poetry,

22:13.040 --> 22:16.680
yoga, Ed Sheeran. I mean, everything
you've ever wanted, right?

22:16.680 --> 22:19.640
You know me so well.

22:19.640 --> 22:21.320
You sure you don't want some piff?

22:21.320 --> 22:22.800
All right, why not?

22:24.800 --> 22:26.960
Somewhere around here. Exactly. Hey!

22:26.960 --> 22:29.040
Put that out, will ya?

22:29.040 --> 22:31.880
Not getting extra hours
cos of your sort. Your sort?

22:31.880 --> 22:35.160
Yeah, the sort that would rather
stand there smoking a joint or

22:35.160 --> 22:38.880
stealing, dealing drugs or whatever
than just doing a decent days' work.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.760
Oh, stealing, dealing drugs.
Why you saying that? Cos he's black?

22:41.760 --> 22:42.960
Because he's here.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.320
So are you, mate.

22:44.320 --> 22:47.200
Yeah, because of his sort.
Come here, give me the joint.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.360
What? What are you doing?

22:48.360 --> 22:50.720
Just give me the joint.
Stop it. Stop!

22:50.720 --> 22:54.160
That's enough! What are you doing?!

22:54.160 --> 22:57.920
All right, stop... Stop it!

22:59.520 --> 23:01.920
An eye for an eye makes
the whole world blind.

23:03.280 --> 23:06.760
Cut it out! Right now!

23:18.640 --> 23:20.160
Who's this belong to?

23:20.160 --> 23:21.720
It's his. No, it ain't.

23:21.720 --> 23:25.880
Somebody owns up
or everyone gets five more hours.

23:25.880 --> 23:29.040
You can't do that. He can do that.
Mr Wilder's a senior officer.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.120
Whose is it?

23:30.120 --> 23:32.520
I've just told you whose it is.
It's his.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.240
Ask her, she knows.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.640
If you know something, speak up.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.200
We... It's mine.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.560
No, it isn't. It's mine.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.840
Five more hours for both of you.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.480
Why is he getting five more hours?

24:01.480 --> 24:02.760
For lying.

24:02.760 --> 24:04.520
Do you want five more hours
for sticking your nose in?

24:04.520 --> 24:07.560
Yeah. You should give me five more
for this as well.

24:08.960 --> 24:13.200
You all seem to have forgotten that
you're all here instead of jail.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.200
So, try not to forget this.

24:16.200 --> 24:20.520
Any of you lot walk, talk or think
out of line,

24:20.520 --> 24:22.640
I will make sure that all of you

24:22.640 --> 24:25.600
spend the rest of your hours
behind bars.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.520
Understood?

24:28.520 --> 24:30.520
Yes.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.760
All right, pack it up people.
We'll do it all again tomorrow.

24:36.760 --> 24:40.000
Apart from the fighting.
And the ganja.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.120
Sir?

24:44.120 --> 24:45.920
I did actually have things
under control.

24:45.920 --> 24:49.000
In what universe is pot-smoking
junkies wrestling

24:49.000 --> 24:51.120
"having things under control"?

25:01.120 --> 25:02.640
Thank you.

26:12.640 --> 26:13.960
Good luck, Daddy.

26:13.960 --> 26:16.840
Mum says if the meeting goes well,
we can have pizza!

26:16.840 --> 26:19.360
I did say that, yes.
OK, good luck, sweetheart.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.680
We love you so much.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.800
Oh, this is sick!

26:33.800 --> 26:36.480
Es. Es, take that off.
Come on, let's go.

26:36.480 --> 26:40.600
Yo, check it out. Virtual reality.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.320
She's walking around a club
in Miami right now.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.600
Come on, Es. Let's go.

26:47.320 --> 26:48.880
Shit, man.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.360
Home, now.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.600
You seem tense, blud.

26:51.600 --> 26:55.480
They do virtual porn - you should
have a tug, let off some steam.

26:59.240 --> 27:00.480
Come on, let's go home.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.720
Here, Es.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.000
Take this 50.
Buy yourself something nice.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.520
She don't want it.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.720
Yeah, I do. It's free money.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.680
No, it's not. Let's go.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.520
Es, I'll hold if for you, yeah?
Yeah!

27:15.520 --> 27:17.160
Why do I have to keep telling you
all the time?

27:17.160 --> 27:18.920
Stop hanging with these people.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.000
Come on. Why do I have to keep...

27:22.360 --> 27:23.840
And, uh, we're very proud

27:23.840 --> 27:26.520
of the fact that,
from those humble beginnings,

27:26.520 --> 27:31.880
we now find ourselves standing here
in this 50,000 square foot space.

27:33.480 --> 27:36.320
But let's, uh, let's,
let's talk more about, uh,

27:36.320 --> 27:39.440
the family side of the business
and, uh...

27:42.720 --> 27:46.400
..where we've come from
and really where we intend to go.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.360
You can really see
the...the year-on-year growth,

27:50.360 --> 27:53.320
and it's this growth
that will mark a significant return

27:53.320 --> 27:55.000
on your investment.

27:57.800 --> 28:01.200
And make a partnership
with Halloran and Son

28:01.200 --> 28:03.480
the only sensible choice.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.920
Xie xie.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.640
♪ Then we danced all night... ♪

28:08.640 --> 28:10.200
Zhao!

28:13.840 --> 28:16.160
I'm very sorry.
Please excuse my daughter.

28:18.280 --> 28:22.440
She loves all things British -
One Direction, Little Mix,

28:22.440 --> 28:23.720
Brooklyn Beckham...

28:23.720 --> 28:27.400
Well, um, on behalf of Britain,
I can only apologise.

28:29.560 --> 28:31.440
Yes.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.920
Our company has built
an impeccable reputation

28:40.920 --> 28:42.200
for integrity and honesty.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.240
So, I hope this doesn't offend you,

28:44.240 --> 28:47.920
but is there anything that we should
know about you or your father

28:47.920 --> 28:50.320
that could bring our company
into disrepute?

28:54.240 --> 28:55.480
There is not.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.040
Meiyou.

29:00.280 --> 29:03.520
I'm sure you'd agree
that business is based on trust.

29:05.880 --> 29:08.040
Why should
we entrust our money to you?

29:10.960 --> 29:12.200
Um...

29:15.080 --> 29:17.800
Why should, why...
Yes, um...

29:19.120 --> 29:20.520
Why?

29:25.120 --> 29:27.040
You, uh,

29:27.040 --> 29:29.000
you keep your family close.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.720
Maybe one day when you retire,
your daughter there

29:31.720 --> 29:33.480
will take the company reins,

29:33.480 --> 29:35.760
if she can stay off
her phone long enough.

29:41.480 --> 29:45.960
My, uh, my father built
this company from nothing.

29:45.960 --> 29:47.760
Worked every hour God gave.

29:47.760 --> 29:50.920
Never, never bellyached,
never asked for a...a hand-out...

29:52.120 --> 29:56.280
On the day he retired,
he had four bidders begging to buy.

29:56.280 --> 29:57.720
But he didn't sell.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.800
He handed the business to me.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.160
And, uh, I asked him,
I said, uh, you know, why?

30:05.160 --> 30:06.480
Why me?

30:06.480 --> 30:08.960
And, um, he told me, he said,

30:08.960 --> 30:12.080
"Trust, son,
is the key to any relationship,

30:12.080 --> 30:13.960
"business or otherwise.

30:13.960 --> 30:18.320
"And who can you trust
if you can't trust family?"

30:18.320 --> 30:21.680
This is a family business,
Chairman Yang.

30:21.680 --> 30:25.640
You place your trust in me,
and you become part of that family.

30:25.640 --> 30:29.200
And, sir,
I never let my family down.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.120
Mr Halloran,

30:42.120 --> 30:44.200
if you prepare the contracts
for review,

30:44.200 --> 30:45.720
we'd like to sign tomorrow.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.800
That's, uh, that's great.
That's great.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.640
Right, well,
I don't know about you, but, uh,

30:55.640 --> 30:59.720
I always find closing deals
very, very thirsty work.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.080
So, uh, please,
grab...grab a glass and, uh...

31:05.760 --> 31:06.800
Yeah.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.200
I met a girl today.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.680
Player.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.440
I want you to talk
to her about school.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.080
I know you're mad at me.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.840
But why have you got to hang out
with them when I told you not to?

31:33.520 --> 31:37.080
This is our family. Yeah?
You and me.

31:37.080 --> 31:38.680
Not them.

31:38.680 --> 31:41.040
You're not my family. You're a joke.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.760
I'm your brother. Show some respect.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.000
Respect what?

31:45.000 --> 31:47.200
They're down there getting
in a Range Rover.

31:47.200 --> 31:50.160
You're up here, unpeggin'
your little sister's underwear.

31:55.320 --> 31:57.200
What were
the other people like?

31:58.320 --> 31:59.560
Fine.

32:01.240 --> 32:03.440
Did you do everything you were told?

32:05.120 --> 32:06.280
Yeah.

32:10.040 --> 32:12.400
Is this our fault?

32:12.400 --> 32:14.000
Did we do something?

32:14.000 --> 32:15.200
No.

32:18.960 --> 32:22.840
We were too soft on you.
We should've set more boundaries.

32:22.840 --> 32:26.040
We should never have taken
the parental control off Netflix.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.560
Mum...

32:27.560 --> 32:30.680
Mum, it's not your fault.

32:33.440 --> 32:36.360
You promise me,
whatever this was about,

32:36.360 --> 32:38.160
this is the end of it.

32:40.440 --> 32:41.960
Promise.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.440
Margie.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.400
Put it down. I'd like to help.

32:56.440 --> 32:58.160
I don't need your help.
Put that down.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.120
Put it down.

33:02.960 --> 33:06.760
While I was inside, I had time
to think about all the people

33:06.760 --> 33:08.680
I effed around in my day.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.720
You're top of the list, Margie.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.480
I want to make that right.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.120
Oh, yeah?

33:15.120 --> 33:16.160
On my life.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.480
Don't promise on your life.
Don't you dare.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.880
You have fooled me 10,000 times,
not again.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.280
I said that you could stay
until the tag comes off.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.240
After that I don't want you in my
or my kids' lives a second longer.

33:26.240 --> 33:27.880
Is that clear?

33:29.880 --> 33:30.960
Crystal.

33:50.040 --> 33:53.960
Keep it down.
Fucking human pipe cleaner.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.880
Sorry.

33:55.880 --> 33:57.320
You OK?

33:57.320 --> 33:59.080
Chinese wine.

33:59.080 --> 34:02.400
Hoo! I told you. Lethal. Yeah.

34:02.400 --> 34:06.280
Oh, Diane, I raised my voice
to you the other day.

34:06.280 --> 34:09.680
That was completely unacceptable.
And I-I would like to apologise.

34:09.680 --> 34:10.800
Accepted.

34:10.800 --> 34:13.640
Yeah, in other news, I've got to be
somewhere by four today

34:13.640 --> 34:15.400
to close a very important
business deal.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.440
I was just wondering if you could
let me go just a little bit early.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.160
We finish at 3.30.

34:20.160 --> 34:22.600
I'm hoping you could make
an exception for me today, OK?

34:22.600 --> 34:24.760
Because I...I cannot be late
for this.

34:24.760 --> 34:28.280
Being late is a serious offence
in Chinese business.

34:29.440 --> 34:30.840
So...

34:30.840 --> 34:33.000
Everyone finishes at 3.30!

34:33.000 --> 34:35.240
Ah, you... For Christ's sake, woman!

34:35.240 --> 34:37.480
I'm just trying to keep
my business from going under,

34:37.480 --> 34:39.960
but no, let's...let's sweep
some old CDs.

34:43.800 --> 34:48.360
So...what's your first impressions
of our little gang?

34:51.600 --> 34:53.200
Everyone's a type.

34:53.200 --> 34:54.720
A type?

34:54.720 --> 34:58.760
Um, you've got
your right-wing blowhard,

34:58.760 --> 35:00.640
left-wing militant,

35:00.640 --> 35:02.680
celebutante,

35:02.680 --> 35:05.040
shifty old-timer,

35:05.040 --> 35:06.840
and whatever the hell he is.

35:07.880 --> 35:10.880
OK. What type am I?

35:10.880 --> 35:13.120
The bad boy.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.440
Why?

35:14.440 --> 35:16.800
What, is it
cos I've got all these tats?

35:16.800 --> 35:18.840
Yeah, tattoos aren't
that rebellious any more.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.360
You know who has tattoos?

35:20.360 --> 35:21.640
Dame Judi Dench.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.480
Well, then, Dame Judi Dench
is a straight up OG like me.

35:26.680 --> 35:27.880
What type are you?

35:29.360 --> 35:30.920
Studious Asian good girl.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.640
Mm. So, why does
the studious Asian good girl

35:34.640 --> 35:36.840
shoplift?

35:36.840 --> 35:39.240
Probably because my dad never gave me

35:39.240 --> 35:42.200
the freedom to go to parties or hang
out in a bus shelter with friends.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.760
Yeah, I've done that.
It's not as incredible as it sounds.

35:44.760 --> 35:48.880
To be fair to my dad, he grew
up in Poland under communism.

35:48.880 --> 35:52.280
So, his idea of freedom
is drinking a can of Pepsi.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.080
Would you do me a favour?

35:57.080 --> 35:58.600
What kind of favour?

35:58.600 --> 36:00.520
My sister's clever, like you.

36:00.520 --> 36:04.360
Well, she's got her GCSEs soon,
and I just can't make her study.

36:05.920 --> 36:08.240
Would you chat to her?

36:09.400 --> 36:11.440
I mean, I'm not sure what I'd say.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.440
But if you think it would help...

36:14.440 --> 36:15.960
Yeah. OK.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.320
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.440
You OK?

36:40.240 --> 36:42.680
Yeah, um, uh, just gimme a second.

36:48.160 --> 36:51.200
I just found a deceased animal,
and I can't tell if it's over 10k.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.040
What we talking?
We're talking a dead badger.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.000
You'd better show me.
Roger that.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.440
Or should it be "bodger that"?

36:56.440 --> 36:58.000
What? Bodger and badger?

37:15.760 --> 37:17.640
What's my sister doing here?

37:17.640 --> 37:20.360
Some men from London are running
their lines into ends.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.480
She asked to help roll up on them.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.000
Well, that ain't happening.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.360
She says she wants to put in work,
innit?

37:26.360 --> 37:30.960
Think about it, yeah?
If I say no, that ain't woke.

37:30.960 --> 37:33.080
In this post-MeToo era,

37:33.080 --> 37:36.120
that kind of blatant sexism
can get you cancelled.

37:36.120 --> 37:39.120
My sister ain't puttin'
in work for you.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.800
Then who is?

37:42.320 --> 37:45.120
Oh, shit, man. I've paid my debts.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.240
I ain't asking permission,
I'm telling you -

37:47.240 --> 37:48.760
someone's doin' dirt tonight,

37:48.760 --> 37:50.880
And if it ain't you,
it's your little sister.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.920
What do you want me to do?

37:56.920 --> 37:59.040
They're sat in a trap house
in Lawrence Hill.

37:59.040 --> 38:02.080
They've got a line with fiends
callin' from Bristol to Penzance.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.480
I need that phone.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.840
Oh, cos they're just gonna hand
over the line because I ask nicely?

38:05.840 --> 38:08.840
Nah. That's why you need this.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.720
Put that away.

38:11.720 --> 38:14.600
Shut up, man. Don't act like you
ain't never seen a strap before.

38:16.160 --> 38:18.560
Where's the spot?

38:18.560 --> 38:20.480
32 Rossmore Avenue.

38:21.520 --> 38:25.640
Look, if I do this for you,
Esme don't hang with you no more.

38:25.640 --> 38:28.040
And I ain't asking you,
I'm telling you.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.840
Yeah, we'll call in the council.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.960
Hi, Clive, it's Diane. Yeah, another
code blue. Fire up the incinerator.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.680
We're talking dead badger.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.480
All right, roger that.
Or should that be "bodger that"?

39:25.680 --> 39:27.480
I know, yeah.
I just thought of it now.

39:28.520 --> 39:30.240
All right, thanks, Clive, bye-bye.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.480
You stole my joke.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.880
Do you want five more hours?! No.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.520
Home time. Tools away.

39:42.360 --> 39:43.960
Great. Yeah.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.920
All right, come on,
let's pick up the pace, people.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.520
Oy! You don't give the orders.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.960
OK, come on,
let's pick up the pace, people!

39:57.440 --> 39:59.040
Everyone, freeze!

40:01.600 --> 40:03.600
Someone better explain...

40:04.640 --> 40:06.240
..about the gun.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.600
A heat gun is missing.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.520
Empty your pockets.

40:14.520 --> 40:15.920
Open your bags.

40:15.920 --> 40:17.200
I'm conducting a search.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.440
Open your bag.

40:22.160 --> 40:25.800
Files, headphones...

40:25.800 --> 40:29.120
She Gone - Coping With Divorce.

40:29.120 --> 40:32.080
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I just broke up with someone, too.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.120
How long has it been?

40:33.120 --> 40:34.840
Since Pancake Day last year.

40:34.840 --> 40:38.400
She sent me out to get a Jif lemon,
and when I came back, she was gone.

40:39.560 --> 40:42.560
People, let's not get side-tracked
by Greg's failed marriage.

40:42.560 --> 40:45.320
A heat gun is missing.
This is serious.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.680
I'll buy you a new one. OK?
Can we please just go?

41:05.560 --> 41:07.640
Is that yours too?

41:07.640 --> 41:09.280
- That one's his.
- No, it ain't.

41:09.280 --> 41:10.760
What, you're a liar and a thief?

41:10.760 --> 41:13.720
Oh, his sort, must be the thief.

41:13.720 --> 41:16.440
You do know not every coloured
person is a living saint?

41:16.440 --> 41:19.720
We don't say coloured person.
We say person of colour.

41:19.720 --> 41:22.080
I'll give you £1,000
if you can tell me the difference.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.560
Why don't you just ask people
how they'd like to be described?

41:24.560 --> 41:28.280
For instance, would you like to be
known as caveman or dinosaur?

41:28.280 --> 41:29.800
Enough!

41:29.800 --> 41:31.280
Pass it here.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.240
Is this your bag?

41:42.240 --> 41:43.840
Never seen it before.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.800
That's bullocks!
I've seen him with it.

41:45.800 --> 41:47.280
So has she.

41:47.280 --> 41:48.680
Is that true?

41:50.280 --> 41:51.440
Three words.

41:51.440 --> 41:54.960
Quid pro quo. Is this his bag?

42:00.360 --> 42:01.600
Yeah.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.280
Thank you.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.640
Everyone on the bus.

42:34.640 --> 42:36.640
Hallelujah.
Thank you so much, Diane,

42:36.640 --> 42:38.520
for those five minutes
we're never getting back.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.680
Snitches get stitches.

42:46.680 --> 42:48.000
All right, leave her alone.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.920
There's a code. What's the code?

42:49.920 --> 42:51.280
No snitching!

42:51.280 --> 42:55.160
Ha! Yeah,
the noble criminal code, huh?

42:55.160 --> 42:59.000
We can rob, steal and murder,
but, uh, telling on one another,

42:59.000 --> 43:00.480
that's...that's where
we draw the line.

43:00.480 --> 43:02.880
We're supposed to stick together.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.360
There's no "we" here.

43:23.120 --> 43:24.800
Uh-bup-bup...

43:36.880 --> 43:39.760
Empty out your pockets.
Bags go through the machine.

43:39.760 --> 43:41.320
You've got to be kidding me!

43:43.360 --> 43:44.960
I need to speak to you.

43:44.960 --> 43:46.320
I've got somewhere to be.

43:46.320 --> 43:47.880
But I really need to speak to you.

43:52.920 --> 43:54.120
Rani!

43:57.320 --> 43:59.400
Oh, come on!

43:59.400 --> 44:00.800
Belt off, please.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.560
Rekowski.

44:06.760 --> 44:08.440
Go home. This is not a Youth Club.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.440
Uh, we were...we were
just talking about...

44:10.440 --> 44:13.720
I'm sure you'll see her again soon.
Go on, Valentino. Off you go.

44:16.880 --> 44:18.520
This'll surprise you,

44:18.520 --> 44:20.160
but when I was your age...

44:21.760 --> 44:23.680
..I was unpopular too.

44:23.680 --> 44:25.880
Yeah, that is a shock.

44:25.880 --> 44:27.280
I heard the talk.

44:27.280 --> 44:30.720
You'll always get grief for doing
the right thing. So, ignore 'em.

44:30.720 --> 44:32.560
They're not your friends.

44:32.560 --> 44:35.080
The only friend you have
around here is me.

44:35.080 --> 44:39.720
And you did good today, OK?
It's going in your report.

44:39.720 --> 44:41.400
Feel better?

44:44.160 --> 44:45.480
What's going on here?

44:45.480 --> 44:49.120
Oh, a heat gun has gone missing,
sir. I'm investigating.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.600
Investigating?

44:50.600 --> 44:53.120
Well, good luck with that, Columbo.

44:57.640 --> 44:59.640
Rekowski, through the machine.

45:01.960 --> 45:03.400
Excuse me.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.200
Less gawking, more walking.

45:11.040 --> 45:12.200
Anything?

45:13.680 --> 45:15.960
What are you doing? You don't
have to take your shoes off.

45:15.960 --> 45:17.440
It's not the bloody airport.

45:17.440 --> 45:19.520
Looks like an airport, doesn't it?

45:19.520 --> 45:22.000
With the metal detector and the...

45:22.000 --> 45:23.080
Well, it isn't.

45:29.520 --> 45:31.880
All right, let's go.
It looks like an airport.

45:33.880 --> 45:35.080
Whoa, whoa!

45:35.080 --> 45:37.360
Step back! Step back!
Come back through, please, sir.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.320
I need to conduct a thorough search.

45:47.360 --> 45:48.760
Is that allowed?

45:50.160 --> 45:51.800
Well, that's not mine.

45:51.800 --> 45:54.400
No, it isn't.
Property of Probation Service.

45:54.400 --> 45:55.680
Nothing gets past me.

45:55.680 --> 45:57.520
I've caught the thief, sir.
I'm not a thief.

45:57.520 --> 46:00.000
If you'll pass me Her Majesty's
bracelets, I'll cuff him.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.120
Cuff me? Right, where's the heat
gun? Is it still on your person?

46:03.120 --> 46:05.440
I'm gonna need
some rubber gloves as well!

46:05.440 --> 46:06.760
No, you're not. Walk very slowly.

46:06.760 --> 46:09.320
You're not going to need any gloves.
We're not in Guantanamo Bay.

46:09.320 --> 46:11.480
Anything could slip out en route.
Come on.

46:15.360 --> 46:16.800
Um...

46:18.280 --> 46:21.120
That, uh, boy asked if I'd read
his sister's course work.

46:21.120 --> 46:22.280
Can I tell him that's OK?

46:24.280 --> 46:25.400
OK, quickly.

46:29.360 --> 46:33.200
You tell your sister that
I am more than happy to help.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.800
Whatever they're making you do...

46:40.320 --> 46:42.680
..please don't.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.040
Rani!

46:58.960 --> 47:00.800
Come on!

47:02.360 --> 47:03.680
Come on!

47:08.440 --> 47:09.680
Hello, Dad.

47:09.680 --> 47:10.720
Did they sign?

47:10.720 --> 47:12.480
I'm just on my way. You're late?!

47:12.480 --> 47:14.080
Jesus, I knew
I should've done this myself.

47:14.080 --> 47:16.200
Do I have to hold your hand
to sign your own bloody name?!

47:16.200 --> 47:18.440
No, Dad, everything's fine.

47:18.440 --> 47:20.160
To be late is offensive
in Chinese business.

47:20.160 --> 47:21.760
Yeah, I'm... I'm aware of that.

47:21.760 --> 47:23.680
By God, if you screw this up, I...

47:23.680 --> 47:25.160
Just call me when it's done!

47:25.160 --> 47:26.440
I'm...

47:35.680 --> 47:37.840
Define metallic bonding.

47:37.840 --> 47:41.000
The electrostatic attraction
between delocalised electrons

47:41.000 --> 47:42.920
and positive metal ions.

47:42.920 --> 47:47.600
Hmm, correct.
What is the octet rule?

47:49.480 --> 47:52.720
Elements combine
in a covalent compound

47:52.720 --> 47:56.000
with eight electrons
in their outer shell.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.240
Are they bothering you?

47:57.240 --> 47:58.280
No.

47:59.400 --> 48:03.320
Hey. Hey!
Can you keep the noise down, please?

48:03.320 --> 48:04.800
My daughter is studying up here.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.480
Fuck off! Get out of here, man.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.160
They have all the privileges
in the world,

48:11.160 --> 48:12.800
and they choose to waste
their lives.

48:12.800 --> 48:16.600
Hmm! Good.
More opportunities for you.

48:16.600 --> 48:19.760
Which of these is the best conductor
of electricity?

48:19.760 --> 48:21.400
Sodium, magnesium or alu....?

48:21.400 --> 48:23.040
Aluminium.

48:23.040 --> 48:24.720
Correct. Very good.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.360
I'm so sorry I'm late.

48:47.360 --> 48:52.760
Oh, I just, uh, had a meeting
with some, uh, new suppliers.

48:52.760 --> 48:55.520
Anyway, the exciting part, huh?

48:55.520 --> 48:57.600
I think we've got
all the paperwork sorted,

48:57.600 --> 49:02.240
so now all we need
is your signatures.

49:06.720 --> 49:09.360
Is...everything OK?

49:16.640 --> 49:20.560
An eye for an eye makes
the whole world blind.

49:22.320 --> 49:23.800
Stop!

50:02.400 --> 50:04.000
I can help with that.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.480
Well, I managed without your help
during puberty,

50:07.480 --> 50:09.920
two divorces
and my mother's dementia,

50:09.920 --> 50:11.920
so I'm pretty sure
I can scrape the paint

50:11.920 --> 50:13.640
off an old door without you.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.160
What's that?

50:18.160 --> 50:21.360
Heat gun. For stripping paint.

50:21.360 --> 50:23.680
Did you steal it? No.

50:23.680 --> 50:25.040
Frank?

50:25.040 --> 50:26.400
I borrowed it.

50:32.320 --> 50:33.720
Plug it in.

51:22.120 --> 51:23.760
Bro.

51:25.400 --> 51:29.480
Come on, bro. It's me, man.

51:29.480 --> 51:31.120
Who's there?

51:31.120 --> 51:32.680
Hey, bro, I just need two Bs, bro.

51:32.680 --> 51:35.120
Eh, no man, you've got the wrong
place. No, bro. Come on, man.

51:35.120 --> 51:36.800
Please, I've got
the money on me now.

51:36.800 --> 51:38.480
I'll just get it out. Please, man...

51:38.480 --> 51:39.800
Hey, man, I said fuck off.

51:44.240 --> 51:45.760
What are you thinking, man?

51:46.920 --> 51:48.160
Sit down.

51:48.160 --> 51:51.200
You, move. Now!

51:57.800 --> 52:00.040
Where's the line? What line?

52:00.040 --> 52:01.800
Don't mess with me, man.
Where's the phone?

52:01.800 --> 52:04.280
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm not gonna ask you again.

52:04.280 --> 52:05.680
Where the fuck is the phone?!

52:08.720 --> 52:10.080
Under the rug, man.

52:33.320 --> 52:34.480
I dare you.

52:40.120 --> 52:41.760
You don't want to do this, man.

52:41.760 --> 52:45.160
I'm telling you, bro.
You're making a mistake, man.

53:03.960 --> 53:05.880
Do you know who you're robbing,
blud?

53:12.240 --> 53:14.400
You don't want to walk out
that door with that bag, bro.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.440
I'm telling you that right now.

53:43.800 --> 53:44.880
Hey!

53:46.400 --> 53:48.440
Go, go, go! Go! Go!

54:13.200 --> 54:15.560
Hey! This way.

55:03.040 --> 55:04.600
Sweetheart.

55:06.120 --> 55:07.720
Did they sign?

55:08.760 --> 55:10.280
Of course.

55:10.280 --> 55:12.720
We're out of the woods?

55:12.720 --> 55:14.080
Absolutely.

55:14.080 --> 55:15.520
Oh, thank God!

55:15.520 --> 55:16.720
Thank God.

55:21.400 --> 55:23.400
Did you tell your dad
the good news?

55:24.320 --> 55:26.160
Yeah. I told him.

55:26.160 --> 55:29.920
Well done, sweetheart.
I am so proud of you.

55:29.920 --> 55:31.440
