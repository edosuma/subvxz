WEBVTT

01:11.471 --> 01:13.173
Hey, Connor?

01:15.843 --> 01:17.845
I got it.

01:23.818 --> 01:25.419
Here we go.

01:39.834 --> 01:41.836
Want to do sandwiches
tonight?

01:44.171 --> 01:46.507
And forget the tomatoes.
I don't want tomatoes.

01:46.541 --> 01:47.742
Okay, I'll try.

01:47.775 --> 01:48.743
No tomatoes.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.745
Okay.

01:51.378 --> 01:56.751
Please report rumors, suspicious activity, and
private gatherings to your local community center.

01:56.784 --> 02:01.188
The signs that someone is planning to
leave our town may not always be obvious.

02:01.221 --> 02:04.291
Remember these people
when your burdens are heavy.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.928
Deserters from this past
week include:

02:06.961 --> 02:09.329
Andrea Deane.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.733
The Gossinger Family.

02:11.766 --> 02:14.468
William Lucas.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.337
Jordan Breck.

02:17.371 --> 02:20.407
And William McCormick.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.247
Face the camera.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.755
Which room today?

02:33.788 --> 02:35.690
Cell D.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.636
It's my job to inform you that
this conversation will be recorded.

02:48.670 --> 02:51.806
To inform our decision regarding whether or not
you can be successfully reintegrated back into our town.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.675
Do you understand?

02:56.410 --> 02:57.645
Verbally, please.

02:57.912 --> 02:59.547
Yes.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.481
State your name.

03:01.516 --> 03:02.850
Martin
Harland

03:03.383 --> 03:06.788
Again. Clearer.

03:07.055 --> 03:08.656
Martin. Harland.

03:10.992 --> 03:13.293
When did you decide to
leave, Martin?

03:13.326 --> 03:14.696
I left Tuesday.

03:14.729 --> 03:16.898
But when did you decide?

03:22.369 --> 03:24.806
How much I can help you
depends on how compliant you are.

03:26.273 --> 03:28.743
I guess I don't
understand the question.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.045
The goal here is
prevention.

03:31.079 --> 03:35.883
If I can figure out why you decided to abandon
us, then we can identify other traitors in the future.

03:35.917 --> 03:36.851
Traitors?

03:36.884 --> 03:38.519
You broke the law.

03:38.553 --> 03:41.689
There isn't one person in this
town that doesn't wish they could leave.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.257
And they don't.

03:44.291 --> 03:47.895
Because they know they have more
than just themselves to look after. CONNOR

03:48.162 --> 03:50.497
I bet you want to leave.

03:50.732 --> 03:52.800
Deep down.

03:52.834 --> 03:54.769
And for what?

03:55.402 --> 04:00.273
Cause some guy said he found a door
to paradise in the middle of the desert?

04:00.708 --> 04:03.878
You know how many people die out
there wandering around looking for nothing?

04:03.911 --> 04:04.411
The door is real.

04:04.444 --> 04:05.278
No it's not.

04:05.312 --> 04:05.980
Why, because you haven't
seen it?

04:06.013 --> 04:07.715
There's nothing to see!

04:10.985 --> 04:12.854
You sure about that?

04:29.036 --> 04:31.639
I used to work at the
powerplant.

04:33.741 --> 04:39.847
My duty was to monitor and
adjust our consumption and supply gauges.

04:40.214 --> 04:46.319
If power drawn was to
exceed our supply.

04:46.353 --> 04:48.388
Everything goes dark.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.826
I was proud of my job.

04:52.425 --> 04:57.598
I felt I allowed
everybody to live a normal life.

04:58.365 --> 05:02.003
For years I ate at my
desk.

05:02.036 --> 05:07.875
Slept on the floor.
Sacrificed relationships, sacrificed everything.

05:09.143 --> 05:15.983
Then o ne day I noticed a fly had
gotten trapped in the glass of the gauge.

05:16.017 --> 05:17.885
So I...

05:17.919 --> 05:20.555
Take off the outer
cabinet.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.523
Power went out.

05:22.557 --> 05:26.861
Eventually I went up to
the top of the roof and

05:26.894 --> 05:29.797
The whole town was dark.

05:29.831 --> 05:31.899
But it was calm.

05:34.569 --> 05:36.838
I could see

05:36.871 --> 05:39.472
Stars, clearly.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.443
I had never really seen
them.

05:46.479 --> 05:49.717
There's too much, I've
never seen.

05:51.519 --> 05:55.388
That's when I knew I was
going to leave.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.094
What's this address?

06:01.629 --> 06:03.898
See for yourself.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.506
A superior wants to talk
to him.

06:58.119 --> 06:59.553
I got it.

06:59.587 --> 07:00.955
Just go eat.

07:07.895 --> 07:11.532
I'm not a mess.

07:14.135 --> 07:16.037
It's open!

07:24.245 --> 07:26.914
Thanks, buddy.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.757
What are you doing after
this?

07:36.791 --> 07:38.559
This.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.562
You okay?

07:41.595 --> 07:42.897
Have them all.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.999
Beautiful.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.637
I need your help with
something.

07:51.806 --> 07:53.207
Whoa.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.182
What's this address?

08:01.215 --> 08:03.684
See for yourself.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.856
Let's go after this?

08:11.625 --> 08:13.227
Yeah.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.790
I'm not really sure what
we're looking for.

09:57.398 --> 10:01.702
By watching this tape, your
path to the door has opened.

10:01.735 --> 10:08.109
If you choose the new path, your world
will change into a wilderness of mirrors.

10:08.142 --> 10:13.781
You will encounter omens,
signposts that are guiding you to the door.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.016
They do not have to make
sense to you.

10:16.050 --> 10:20.354
All that matters is that you recognize
them as proof that you're going the right way.

10:22.256 --> 10:24.692
It's up to you.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.727
Don't be afraid.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.790
What would you say if I
wanted to leave?

11:00.995 --> 11:04.331
I'd say don't tell me
about it.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.372
Do you want to see it in
person?

11:53.280 --> 11:54.683
I had a pager on me when
they found me.

11:54.715 --> 11:58.385
Get it from your people and
bring it with you when we leave.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.689
What's it for?

12:00.721 --> 12:04.225
I'll tell you what it's for when we're
on the road, okay? But we have to leave tonight.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.462
What did that woman
want?

12:13.067 --> 12:17.938
I'll die before I let
her take me away.

12:22.977 --> 12:25.913
Midnight tonight.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.214
What's that?

13:34.248 --> 13:35.149
For Rick.

13:44.526 --> 13:45.326
What?

13:45.359 --> 13:46.894
Damnit.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.463
I did it earlier.

13:51.065 --> 13:53.067
I don't know how I
forgot.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.603
It's fine.

13:56.638 --> 13:59.139
How have you been
feeling?

14:01.108 --> 14:03.410
The light's by the tube.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.929
I've been good.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.632
I've been good for a
while.

14:28.402 --> 14:30.404
I'm going to check on
the generator.

16:22.584 --> 16:25.085
What's going on?

16:25.118 --> 16:28.121
He took his own life.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.694
I know you interrogated
him.

16:34.228 --> 16:37.030
You good?

16:38.065 --> 16:38.766
Let it go.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.503
Mmhmm.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.337
Hello!

18:26.440 --> 18:29.544
Hello!

19:27.535 --> 19:30.638
O-61

19:36.243 --> 19:39.179
N-38

19:46.486 --> 19:47.955
Bingo.

20:26.728 --> 20:28.730
Where are we going?

20:28.930 --> 20:31.331
Going to Rick's.

20:50.718 --> 20:51.919
Can we come in?

20:52.220 --> 20:54.922
Yeah!

20:58.860 --> 21:00.360
Thomas, can I get you
anything?

21:00.393 --> 21:01.829
No.

21:01.863 --> 21:03.898
I don't know if I have anything
to eat or drink, but I can check.

21:03.931 --> 21:04.832
I'm fine.

21:04.866 --> 21:06.601
Connor?

21:11.438 --> 21:12.807
So?

21:12.840 --> 21:14.842
Can I talk to you
outside?

21:15.943 --> 21:17.945
Outside?

21:17.979 --> 21:20.982
Why can't you talk in
here?

21:24.619 --> 21:26.921
Yeah okay, let's talk.

21:30.558 --> 21:31.926
You going to be alright
for a minute?

21:31.959 --> 21:35.730
Connor, if you want to
tell me something just say it now.

22:25.680 --> 22:30.952
I gotta go away from a couple days, so
Rick said he could. You could stay with him.

22:31.853 --> 22:33.453
Where are you going?

22:33.486 --> 22:36.924
Connor just needs to get something
out of his system. Don't you, Connor?

22:37.124 --> 22:38.659
I feel like I have a
right to know.

22:38.693 --> 22:40.360
Especially if we're
putting right out, here.

22:40.393 --> 22:44.699
Why don't we get out of here, go grab
your stuff so we can get you set up here.

22:44.732 --> 22:47.535
No. I don't want to get
back in that truck again today.

22:49.770 --> 22:51.138
Rick and I have got it
from here.

22:51.806 --> 22:52.673
Yeah.

22:53.007 --> 22:55.009
You just get on your
way.

25:09.577 --> 25:11.078
She's coming.

27:01.322 --> 27:03.224
I have a gun.

27:06.060 --> 27:09.330
If there's anyone in there,
come out now and I'll let you live.

28:00.014 --> 28:01.382
That's all I have.

28:03.150 --> 28:04.084
Where's the tracker?

28:04.118 --> 28:05.352
Stop! Stop! Stop! I
shattered it!

28:09.089 --> 28:11.892
No! I-I-I know where
to go!

28:12.159 --> 28:13.827
The door, right?

28:14.361 --> 28:17.231
You're looking for the
door?

28:18.265 --> 28:19.266
I know where it is.

28:20.467 --> 28:23.103
I do! I figured it out!

28:23.137 --> 28:25.039
I'll take you there!

28:28.075 --> 28:29.143
So?

28:31.312 --> 28:33.147
You have four days.

28:35.082 --> 28:36.884
Get up.

29:23.497 --> 29:27.134
We should probably just
rest here for the night.

29:28.469 --> 29:30.938
While we're isolated.

29:38.546 --> 29:42.883
We have to rest at some
point, might as well be here.

29:46.186 --> 29:47.421
Goodnight then.

29:49.857 --> 29:51.492
Goodnight.

30:47.014 --> 30:48.882
Get in!

31:01.128 --> 31:03.531
We should get off the
road.

32:23.110 --> 32:25.513
Give me the keys.

32:38.793 --> 32:40.194
Give me the keys.

32:40.227 --> 32:44.364
All you had to do was
guide me there.

32:56.544 --> 32:59.112
This doesn't have to
be over.

33:03.785 --> 33:05.720
I'm still going with
you.

33:39.453 --> 33:41.723
We'll be gone in the
morning.

33:41.756 --> 33:44.024
Stay if you like.

34:28.736 --> 34:31.204
Just look for the big
barn at the end of the road.

34:31.238 --> 34:32.840
Pick one.

34:34.876 --> 34:37.845
There's a big fire next to
it, it's kind of hard to miss.

34:43.785 --> 34:46.386
You can keep that one.

34:49.423 --> 34:51.593
Thank you.

35:51.819 --> 35:52.352
Michelle.

35:52.386 --> 35:54.555
What's it say?

36:22.917 --> 36:25.352
Oh, sorry, I thought
you were...

36:25.385 --> 36:28.656
I'm not, sorry.

36:51.311 --> 36:53.848
Who's Michelle?

36:56.751 --> 36:58.853
My daughter.

37:00.755 --> 37:02.857
What happened?

37:04.726 --> 37:09.797
She thinks the door is
going to solve her problems.

37:11.465 --> 37:13.534
What do you know?

37:16.604 --> 37:18.773
I've been there.

37:19.306 --> 37:21.776
It's not the answer.

37:24.512 --> 37:31.886
You're just exchanging
your problems for new ones.

37:33.621 --> 37:38.325
Maybe you were her
problem.

37:41.729 --> 37:44.866
I was the only one
keeping her safe.

37:47.367 --> 37:54.008
You were just going to
keep her safe her entire life?

37:54.041 --> 37:58.045
I'm her mother, that's
my job.

41:28.656 --> 41:34.128
Reminds me how my dad looked.
You know, how he dressed?

41:35.329 --> 41:37.732
Actually, can I see?

41:40.634 --> 41:44.105
That's him, eh?

41:48.576 --> 41:50.711
We thought you were a
goner.

41:51.078 --> 41:53.547
Quite the piece you had on
you.

41:53.581 --> 41:55.816
What are you doing out
here alone?

41:59.854 --> 42:02.656
Answer her question.

42:03.057 --> 42:04.825
Door.

42:06.127 --> 42:09.263
I know. I know where to
go.

42:09.296 --> 42:10.998
What makes you think you
know where you're going?

42:15.236 --> 42:17.338
You thirsty?

42:17.371 --> 42:19.774
Alright, alright, alright.

42:23.344 --> 42:25.579
So what happened?

42:26.814 --> 42:29.150
My truck broke down.

42:30.851 --> 42:31.952
You've been on foot a
while then.

42:36.223 --> 42:37.758
How long have you guys been
out here?

42:41.128 --> 42:43.064
It's taken a -

42:43.097 --> 42:45.132
- A lot of times -
- WOMAN: With a trip like this -

42:45.166 --> 42:45.699
Sorry.

42:46.634 --> 42:50.871
Most people we meet out here
are looking for the easy route.

42:52.873 --> 42:53.774
And they give up.

42:55.743 --> 42:56.343
Or die.

42:58.946 --> 43:00.915
They just don't make it.

43:01.816 --> 43:06.954
They don't understand that
this place is constantly testing you.

43:10.057 --> 43:15.696
So right now we're being
patient, and waiting for the next omen.

43:18.265 --> 43:21.102
Well how do you know
when it shows up?

43:22.036 --> 43:24.305
It'll be obvious.

43:28.309 --> 43:29.743
I see omens too.

43:30.044 --> 43:33.314
I had this tracker that,
uh, the numbers...

43:33.347 --> 43:33.981
You still have it on you?

43:34.014 --> 43:34.949
We checked him already.

43:35.149 --> 43:37.084
I know.

43:38.285 --> 43:39.186
I don't have it.

43:39.720 --> 43:42.056
Then I'll lead.

43:42.756 --> 43:46.627
You pull your weight, you
can come with.

43:47.094 --> 43:49.763
Deal?

43:58.706 --> 44:00.141
Good.

45:08.842 --> 45:10.177
Hey.

45:40.975 --> 45:44.078
Twenty to Mulberry.

45:44.111 --> 45:45.779
The door is in Mulberry?

45:45.813 --> 45:47.281
No.

45:47.515 --> 45:49.483
It's just a sign of how
far we've made it out.

45:49.517 --> 45:50.784
Hey will you pass me some
water?

45:57.057 --> 45:59.493
How many more we got?

46:02.229 --> 46:06.433
Uh... one.

46:07.602 --> 46:08.536
One?

46:14.308 --> 46:16.944
You can take us to more,
right?

46:28.422 --> 46:30.357
Here.

46:32.359 --> 46:33.093
Grab that.

46:35.029 --> 46:42.970
So last time, I'd say it took about three feet,
and water just started, you know... pouring out.

46:43.237 --> 46:45.372
That's about up to here,
okay?

47:03.658 --> 47:05.993
For your work.

47:08.663 --> 47:10.364
It should be any minute
now.

47:37.659 --> 47:40.361
Are you sure this was the
spot?

47:45.399 --> 47:47.868
Did you think there would
be water?

47:49.403 --> 47:50.371
I don't know.

47:53.340 --> 47:55.577
Then you'll never find
it.

47:56.578 --> 47:58.946
Or the door.

48:02.182 --> 48:04.251
You're wasting your time.

48:24.672 --> 48:28.008
I need you to make
something happen, please.

48:32.714 --> 48:34.982
I will.

49:47.655 --> 49:50.257
Hey, godamnnit.

49:50.290 --> 49:52.326
PATHFINDER. Where you been?

49:53.460 --> 49:55.095
Hey you see that?

49:55.362 --> 49:55.930
Yeah right there.

49:56.898 --> 49:59.601
That's mine by the way in
case you were wondering, the blood.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.369
This is what a
mutiny looks like.

50:04.171 --> 50:04.739
Mutiny?

50:04.772 --> 50:06.206
Yeah.

50:06.741 --> 50:07.675
Hey.

50:07.709 --> 50:08.610
Hey!

50:10.210 --> 50:11.278
Hey!

50:12.514 --> 50:14.348
You're here to find
the door, right?

50:14.649 --> 50:16.684
The door?

50:20.555 --> 50:21.488
What is that?

50:21.523 --> 50:22.690
Yeah.

50:23.490 --> 50:25.158
I got all kinds of
em, look.

50:25.627 --> 50:26.326
Yeah.

50:27.261 --> 50:28.262
Here.

50:35.469 --> 50:37.070
There's more than one
door?

50:37.337 --> 50:38.305
Yeah, man.

50:38.338 --> 50:39.741
They're everywhere.

50:40.307 --> 50:41.341
It's random.

50:41.375 --> 50:44.712
One'll pop up
somewhere, and then go.

50:44.746 --> 50:47.549
Another comes up
somewhere else and disappears.

50:48.115 --> 50:49.483
Why haven't you gone
through?

50:50.150 --> 50:52.620
Then the journey
would be over now wouldn't it.

50:56.356 --> 50:58.560
I was dreaming about
one the other day.

50:59.259 --> 51:01.361
And I woke up right
in the middle of it.

51:01.729 --> 51:04.566
There was one right
in front of my feet.

51:05.399 --> 51:06.233
Yeah.

51:06.266 --> 51:07.434
You find them all like
that?

51:08.903 --> 51:09.336
No.

51:09.804 --> 51:12.339
The door's waiting
on you.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.241
Not the other way
around.

51:16.511 --> 51:17.210
Hey.

51:17.812 --> 51:18.412
Hey! Come on.

51:18.445 --> 51:19.479
Hey.

51:19.714 --> 51:20.213
Hey!

51:20.748 --> 51:22.215
Hey you want to find
the door or not?

51:23.518 --> 51:24.217
Hey!

52:10.898 --> 52:12.834
You seen anything?

52:13.367 --> 52:15.803
I'm not sure.

52:22.710 --> 52:25.713
Where would you go if you
weren't with us?

52:26.480 --> 52:28.181
We should get out of the
van.

52:28.215 --> 52:29.550
I think we
should sit this one out.

52:29.584 --> 52:30.852
No.

52:30.885 --> 52:32.152
This is the only thing
keeping us safe.

52:32.854 --> 52:36.524
There's something important out there. And
we're not going to see it if we stay in here.

52:41.294 --> 52:42.195
You're right.

52:46.299 --> 52:47.769
I'll follow you!

52:49.236 --> 52:51.238
This way!

54:39.446 --> 54:40.915
Who is that?

54:42.617 --> 54:44.451
Michelle.

54:44.484 --> 54:46.453
Don't.

54:56.931 --> 55:01.869
Either you and I go right now
or you let her take you in more circles.

55:06.507 --> 55:07.542
Michelle!

55:39.941 --> 55:41.441
Do you want to stay?

55:45.646 --> 55:47.414
Then I'm going to need
you to get rid of that.

56:11.172 --> 56:12.139
Hey.

56:25.586 --> 56:27.521
This is a Mulberry sign.

56:29.957 --> 56:31.626
Which means we've been
going that way.

56:32.894 --> 56:34.095
At least this far.

57:18.773 --> 57:20.541
You think the van can
clear this?

57:50.905 --> 57:53.240
We're on the right
track.

57:54.041 --> 57:56.577
Jesus. That means we're on
the right track?

58:05.219 --> 58:06.887
Alright, so what now?

58:14.695 --> 58:16.230
We're close.

58:21.569 --> 58:23.037
What do you need from me?

58:24.338 --> 58:25.806
To wait.

58:36.283 --> 58:39.520
I'm gonna go scout or
something.

58:40.087 --> 58:41.288
What if you miss it?

58:41.322 --> 58:43.524
I'll be gone ten minutes.

59:13.888 --> 59:15.890
Come on.

59:57.898 --> 59:59.100
Hey.

1:00:00.901 --> 1:00:01.635
Hey.

1:00:07.308 --> 1:00:08.742
Where's your water?

1:00:36.003 --> 1:00:39.106
Come on. Show me
something.

1:00:40.941 --> 1:00:42.676
Show me something.

1:01:21.015 --> 1:01:22.183
Please.

1:01:25.986 --> 1:01:27.454
I never asked for
anything.

1:01:28.088 --> 1:01:29.290
What happened to you?

1:01:32.193 --> 1:01:33.394
Did you find what you
were looking for?

1:01:37.164 --> 1:01:37.932
No.

1:01:40.467 --> 1:01:41.969
Just come home.

1:01:45.239 --> 1:01:47.041
Will you take me back?

1:01:47.474 --> 1:01:48.442
You've gone too far.

1:01:48.475 --> 1:01:50.911
No. No, I can come back.

1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:53.714
Your friend is planning
your death.

1:01:56.817 --> 1:01:58.185
He's not my friend.

1:02:00.421 --> 1:02:01.922
Then prove it.

1:03:06.487 --> 1:03:08.122
Hey.

1:03:08.422 --> 1:03:09.557
Hey.

1:03:12.527 --> 1:03:13.927
Hey.

1:03:19.634 --> 1:03:20.568
I didn't mean to be gone
that-

1:03:47.194 --> 1:03:48.429
Just tell me why!

1:03:49.597 --> 1:03:51.098
Just tell me why.

1:03:51.566 --> 1:03:54.101
I just want to go home.

1:04:08.916 --> 1:04:11.985
Look I know what you're about to
do, but just tell me why.

1:04:17.024 --> 1:04:19.193
Explain it to me.

1:04:22.162 --> 1:04:23.030
Hm?

1:04:28.469 --> 1:04:31.205
I have to see this for
myself.

1:04:34.007 --> 1:04:36.076
I have to see this for
myself.

1:04:37.344 --> 1:04:38.479
If anything should
happen to me.

1:04:38.513 --> 1:04:39.547
Don't do this.

1:04:39.781 --> 1:04:40.948
This is my route.

1:05:07.074 --> 1:05:08.610
I know how you're gonna
die.

1:05:52.219 --> 1:05:53.688
What do you have?

1:05:54.054 --> 1:05:55.255
You have water?

1:06:44.271 --> 1:06:45.372
Bury me!

1:06:45.405 --> 1:06:46.406
Bury!

1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:47.642
Bury! Please! Bury me!

1:06:47.675 --> 1:06:48.743
Okay! Okay!

1:06:48.776 --> 1:06:49.376
Bury me!

1:06:49.409 --> 1:06:50.110
Where?

1:06:50.310 --> 1:06:52.246
Where!

1:08:12.827 --> 1:08:15.395
So what happens now?

1:08:18.265 --> 1:08:20.500
Now you choose.

1:08:24.237 --> 1:08:26.306
I don't understand.

1:08:27.474 --> 1:08:30.210
You can have anything you
want.

1:08:30.477 --> 1:08:33.213
You have already paid the
price to get here.

1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:48.195
What did you choose?

1:09:07.515 --> 1:09:09.449
I want to know what you
know.

1:09:13.621 --> 1:09:15.489
Close your eyes.

1:09:20.528 --> 1:09:23.363
I'm really scared.

1:09:25.700 --> 1:09:27.234
Don't be.

1:09:31.806 --> 1:09:33.373
Close your eyes.

1:10:10.343 --> 1:10:12.547
Hello?

1:10:14.916 --> 1:10:16.751
Hey.

1:10:18.385 --> 1:10:19.787
Hey.

1:10:35.302 --> 1:10:37.772
I'm sorry.

1:10:38.773 --> 1:10:41.374
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:11:01.963 --> 1:11:08.301
What, what are we
strangers now?

1:11:11.873 --> 1:11:14.642
I'm at the door.

1:11:16.744 --> 1:11:19.379
I turn the knob.

1:11:21.015 --> 1:11:23.316
I'm on the other side.

1:11:39.499 --> 1:11:41.334
You knew my mother.

1:11:46.707 --> 1:11:48.509
It's right there.

1:11:48.543 --> 1:11:52.914
Yeah, it is.

1:11:55.850 --> 1:11:58.418
So what happens now?

1:11:58.653 --> 1:12:00.755
Tell me why you did
it.

1:12:01.956 --> 1:12:02.657
I had to.

1:12:02.690 --> 1:12:03.524
Why?

1:12:05.126 --> 1:12:06.594
Why!

1:12:06.627 --> 1:12:07.695
It was her or me.

1:12:07.728 --> 1:12:08.763
No.

1:12:08.796 --> 1:12:09.697
It was her or me.

1:12:09.730 --> 1:12:11.431
It doesn't have to be
like this.

1:12:11.464 --> 1:12:12.600
Yes it does.

1:12:12.633 --> 1:12:14.501
Say you're sorry!

1:12:14.535 --> 1:12:17.404
There's nothing that you
can do to stop me.

1:12:20.708 --> 1:12:22.710
You don't deserve it!
