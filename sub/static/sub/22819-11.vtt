WEBVTT

00:07.550 --> 00:11.846
<i>More, give me more Give me more</i>

00:13.055 --> 00:16.809
<i>If I had a heart
I could love you</i>

00:18.686 --> 00:22.565
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

00:24.817 --> 00:29.155
<i>After the night When I wake up</i>

00:29.572 --> 00:34.827
<i>I'll see What tomorrow brings</i>

00:41.125 --> 00:44.837
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

01:08.361 --> 01:09.362
Ha!

01:32.677 --> 01:34.261
People of Kattegat,

01:34.804 --> 01:37.515
I am Ivar, the Boneless.

01:38.474 --> 01:40.643
I am the son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.646
All hail your new King.

01:53.155 --> 01:54.448
Hit him more!

02:06.961 --> 02:08.421
To Kattegat!

02:08.504 --> 02:10.089
To Kattegat!

02:10.172 --> 02:12.758
The greatest prize of all.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.929
As long as Lagertha
remains alive,

02:17.012 --> 02:19.390
then I have not yet
had my revenge.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.769
We have gained
the kingdom of Kattegat.

02:24.729 --> 02:29.108
But I still have
a hollow feeling inside.

02:29.942 --> 02:31.068
Don't worry.

02:32.528 --> 02:35.322
How long can she
and the others escape us?

02:36.115 --> 02:37.450
We have scouts everywhere.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.494
And after all,
where can they go?

02:40.911 --> 02:43.122
Who will shelter them from us?

02:46.959 --> 02:48.085
Well, it is true,

02:50.087 --> 02:53.924
I also feel, uh...
hollow inside.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.218
I've gained the world, but...

02:58.095 --> 02:59.388
I've lost everything.

03:02.475 --> 03:03.809
I killed my own brother.

03:04.602 --> 03:07.563
My wife is dead
and my unborn child with her.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.483
Harald, I wouldn't worry
too much about that.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.152
What do you mean?

03:13.861 --> 03:15.279
Life... Life goes on.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.907
Take a look around!

03:18.199 --> 03:20.409
There are plenty
of beautiful women here.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.678
Warriors!

03:43.140 --> 03:45.976
Warriors, it is time

03:46.477 --> 03:49.814
for another toast
to honor the Boneless,

03:50.397 --> 03:52.858
the new King of Kattegat.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.945
Skoll

03:56.028 --> 03:57.029
To me.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.661
Bring in the queen!

04:04.537 --> 04:06.372
Bring in the queen!

04:18.843 --> 04:19.844
Uh...

04:23.138 --> 04:26.433
Hail the queen, hail the queen!

04:38.237 --> 04:39.905
Our temple is burnt.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.827
Eyvind's son, Bul, was slain.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.289
And now Ketill's son, Thorgrim.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.584
Clearly, we have fallen back
into the old ways.

04:52.167 --> 04:55.379
Perhaps, we have proven once and
for all that we cannot change.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.299
That we are what we are.

05:02.428 --> 05:04.763
But we must stop
this vicious cycle

05:04.847 --> 05:06.307
of revenge and killing now.

05:07.349 --> 05:12.187
Or else, our young and fragile
community is sure to perish.

05:13.439 --> 05:15.608
To regain the favor of the gods,

05:16.734 --> 05:19.361
I'm willing to sacrifice
my body and my blood.

05:22.907 --> 05:25.075
But it is not my decision
to make on my own.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.829
You must all decide
whether or not

05:28.913 --> 05:30.331
you will accept my offer.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.918
I won't accept
Floki's sacrifice.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.507
Floki is closer to the
gods than any of us.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.302
Why would they seek
his punishment?

05:43.969 --> 05:45.679
It doesn't make sense.

05:46.597 --> 05:49.183
None of you can vote
to sacrifice him.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.480
Of course we must
sacrifice Floki.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.608
He lied to us!

05:58.567 --> 06:01.153
He told us he had found
the land of the gods.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.572
If this is the land of the gods,

06:04.615 --> 06:05.991
where have they gone?

06:06.992 --> 06:08.827
Maybe they never wanted us here.

06:09.119 --> 06:13.540
Maybe they are angry with
Floki for bringing us here.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.669
Does he know
the will of the gods?

06:18.170 --> 06:20.339
Does he think he is a god?

06:23.050 --> 06:24.802
He is only a man.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.639
And men make mistakes.

06:30.099 --> 06:32.893
And it is a mistake
for us to be here,

06:33.560 --> 06:35.312
in this shit place.

06:36.105 --> 06:41.276
It is a land of stone,
sulfur and death.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.740
I am sure the gods
are watching us

06:47.741 --> 06:48.867
and they are laughing.

06:49.493 --> 06:50.828
Laughing at us.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.790
Floki deserves to die,

06:56.667 --> 06:58.502
for punishment for his lies,

06:59.878 --> 07:01.630
for our self-respect.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.924
Those who agree say, "Aye."

07:04.008 --> 07:05.009
Aye!

07:05.092 --> 07:06.093
Aye!

07:06.176 --> 07:07.428
Aye!

07:50.054 --> 07:52.431
Rollo, Duke of Normandy.

07:56.685 --> 07:57.936
King Ivar.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.649
King Harald.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.319
Hvitserk.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.280
Your Highness, Rollo.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.199
Welcome back to Kattegat.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.577
We would like to thank you
for supporting our cause

08:13.660 --> 08:17.456
and help us gain a famous
victory over our enemies.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.375
Kattegat is an important
trading station.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.880
I've every reason to desire
to make an alliance with it.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.591
And I was persuaded by Hvitserk

08:27.674 --> 08:30.886
that you
and King Harald together

08:32.054 --> 08:35.891
would overcome the forces
of Lagertha, Bjorn and Ubbe.

08:36.141 --> 08:39.061
But may I ask, why are
you here now in person?

08:40.521 --> 08:42.147
Because I miss the old place.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.196
Ah.

08:49.321 --> 08:52.908
Perhaps, you have ambitions
to rule the old place.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.786
I rule over enough
cities and lands

08:56.453 --> 08:59.289
to satisfy the requirements
of any man.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.836
Why would I want the further
burden of garrisoning Kattegat?

09:04.711 --> 09:08.465
We obviously want to reward you
for what you have done for us.

09:08.549 --> 09:09.550
Don't worry, you will.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.095
We will strike a trade deal

09:13.178 --> 09:15.639
which will be
extremely favorable to me.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.977
You will also make an alliance
for our mutual defense,

09:20.060 --> 09:25.691
so that if I am attacked by
anyone, you will send warriors

09:26.859 --> 09:27.985
to support me.

09:32.114 --> 09:34.283
Now, in the old days,

09:34.366 --> 09:37.703
we had a tradition
of hospitality here.

09:37.911 --> 09:41.623
Even Ragnar fed
and watered his guests, yes?

09:46.461 --> 09:47.462
<i>Those against.</i>

09:53.093 --> 09:54.136
It is equal.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.056
Who hasn't voted?

09:59.683 --> 10:00.684
It's me.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.067
I don't want to vote.

10:09.818 --> 10:12.362
Everyone must vote.
It is the law.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.114
You are my son.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.825
You must vote with your family.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.785
He should vote as he wants.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.454
No, he shouldn't.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.415
Family is everything.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.168
You should know that.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.503
All right, I'II vote.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.511
I'm sorry, Floki.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.848
Butlhaveto refuse your offer

10:39.932 --> 10:42.017
of sacrificing yourself
for our greater good.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.270
You are more important
to us alive.

10:50.192 --> 10:51.318
And Father,

10:52.319 --> 10:54.905
my family now is Thorunn
and our unborn child.

11:08.919 --> 11:10.587
I confess,

11:10.671 --> 11:13.423
when Hvitserk came to me
and told me of your civil war,

11:15.676 --> 11:16.760
I was jealous.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.973
I cannot fight anymore.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.351
I am not allowed to.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.524
I'm far too important.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.823
I remember once

11:39.032 --> 11:41.952
hearing a story of a berserker

11:42.035 --> 11:45.122
who, against the odds,
went on to live

11:46.206 --> 11:49.418
a long, angry
and frustrated old age.

11:49.918 --> 11:53.296
He told his servants
to go and collect

11:53.588 --> 11:58.677
all of his iron utensils, used
pots and pans, his... his weapons

11:59.803 --> 12:02.931
and carry them up
to the top of a high cliff

12:03.682 --> 12:06.393
and throw them off of it,
so he could hear one last time

12:08.478 --> 12:09.521
the noise of battle.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.858
Ah, you would
have loved it, Uncle.

12:13.859 --> 12:15.318
The battles were fierce.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.697
Great warriors were
slain on both sides.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.550
Odin must've been happy to take

12:20.574 --> 12:22.951
so many back to sup with him
in Valhalla.

12:23.285 --> 12:25.454
But not you. brother?
NO. “Qt me.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.081
Ubbe spared my life.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.668
Well, he is your brother,
after all.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.302
What is it I should know?

12:47.434 --> 12:48.643
I killed Halfdan.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.814
I killed my brother.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.568
I tried to kill mine once.

13:01.823 --> 13:05.410
So, Ubbe lives?

13:06.036 --> 13:07.120
Yes.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.790
And Bjorn?

13:09.956 --> 13:11.875
Of course Bjorn Ironside lives.

13:11.958 --> 13:12.958
I taught him to fight.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.129
Who can kill him?

13:19.174 --> 13:20.842
There's someone else
who's still alive.

13:22.219 --> 13:25.138
The woman that haunts
my days and nights.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.350
The woman that I've sworn

13:29.476 --> 13:31.019
upon my sacred ring to kill.

13:32.437 --> 13:33.605
You mean Lagertha?

13:35.649 --> 13:37.442
- Where is she?
- We don't know.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.821
All we know is that
after the defeat,

13:42.322 --> 13:46.743
Lagertha, Ubbe, Bjorn, Torvi
left Kattegat in a hurry.

13:48.411 --> 13:49.663
Disappeared.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.665
We have scouts looking for them.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.044
We will find them
before too long.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.842
I wish you luck.

14:31.580 --> 14:32.789
Why don't we go to Hedeby?

14:33.623 --> 14:34.823
Do we still have people there?

14:35.709 --> 14:39.045
They won't be for long
when Ivar discovers our plans.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.131
How long before
his scouts find us?

14:42.507 --> 14:44.009
A few weeks maybe,
if we're lucky.

14:45.302 --> 14:49.264
I refuse to accept that this
is the end of my story.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.099
To be captured,

14:51.808 --> 14:55.770
humiliated and killed
by Ivar. No.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.690
I am worth more than that.

14:58.773 --> 15:01.234
We don't have an army
capable of challenging him.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.237
There must be something
we can do, somewhere we can go.

15:04.696 --> 15:05.697
Where?

15:05.780 --> 15:08.575
Where, Ubbe'? What can
we do, where can we go?

15:09.367 --> 15:11.367
Ivar will surely chase us
to the ends of the Earth.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.662
We could go to England.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.623
Hmm. Where they will kill us.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.500
Possibly, not necessarily.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.421
I will intercede on your
behalf with King Aethelwulf.

15:22.297 --> 15:23.798
He will almost
certainly welcome you.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.759
But he will ask you
to fight for him,

15:26.384 --> 15:30.138
against the Danes
or other raiding Vikings.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.943
We could establish
our claim to the lands,

15:43.360 --> 15:45.236
in East Anglia,
given to us by Ecbert.

15:45.904 --> 15:48.573
I don't want to leave
my country and my home.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.789
I am tired

15:57.332 --> 15:58.333
offighfing.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.379
And yet, let's do it.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.051
Let's go to England.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.049
I've brought you some food.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.391
I want to see Ubbe.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.977
I want to see my husband.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.647
You're stopping him
from seeing me, I know.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.441
You're a devil.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.402
Hmm.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.446
I'll ask him to come
and see you.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.076
I'll kill you.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.662
You stole my husband.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.372
I wish you were dead.

17:31.426 --> 17:32.427
Husband.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.972
I don't need to be chained up.

17:37.348 --> 17:38.725
I'm not an animal.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.941
It's too dangerous
to set you free, Margrethe.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.488
Do what you will, both of you.

17:52.072 --> 17:55.033
You will find that no chains
will ever bind me.

17:56.785 --> 17:59.370
Not even if the dwarves
forged them.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.500
It's not her fault.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.044
But we cannot bring her
to England.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.630
Then what do we do with her?

18:15.220 --> 18:16.513
<i>Do you want to go back?</i>

18:18.306 --> 18:19.432
I think so.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.559
Yes.

18:22.727 --> 18:23.978
For your sake as much as mine.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.692
And will you be Bishop
again of your church?

18:30.777 --> 18:32.821
Will you be
Bishop Heahmund again?

18:34.364 --> 18:36.407
I think King Aethelwulf
willfully restore me.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.244
We're old allies.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.461
In my faith,

18:49.504 --> 18:52.090
the Bishop of the Holy Church
must be celibate.

18:53.842 --> 18:54.926
I cannot acknowledge you.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.054
I cannot openly live with you.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.726
Does this make you sad?

19:04.686 --> 19:06.688
What do you think?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.982
Well, I hope it makes you sad.

19:11.234 --> 19:12.443
I cannot give you up,

19:13.444 --> 19:15.113
even though it goes
against my teachings,

19:15.905 --> 19:18.074
my faith, my church,
my being in Christ.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.581
I've known desire
for women before

19:24.664 --> 19:27.083
andrenouncedit and found
a path back to Christ.

19:28.251 --> 19:31.045
But you, I cannot renounce you.

19:35.300 --> 19:38.011
You are
an incredible woman. Lagertha.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.096
Now God

19:41.181 --> 19:42.640
must have meant for us to meet.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.276
- Riders!
- Riders!

20:09.667 --> 20:11.044
By all the gods.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.254
It's Rollo.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.799
This my first witan
as your new king.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.093
I know it will not
be easy to follow

21:00.176 --> 21:02.887
in my father's
and grandfather's footsteps.

21:03.513 --> 21:06.140
Nevertheless, I shall
try my best.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.465
We are still gravely threatened

21:08.518 --> 21:11.187
by the incursions
of the Northmen.

21:11.396 --> 21:14.816
It is my intention to increase our
defenses by building new forts

21:14.941 --> 21:17.610
and watohtowers along our coast
and along our inland rivers.

21:18.027 --> 21:19.612
I've also ordered work to begin

21:19.696 --> 21:21.416
on the construction
of a fleet of new ships.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.533
But as king,

21:24.367 --> 21:27.704
I feel I have responsibility not
only for the lives of our people,

21:27.954 --> 21:29.247
but also their souls.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.873
Therefore,

21:30.999 --> 21:32.458
I've ordered all the monasteries

21:32.542 --> 21:34.585
and religious houses
within my realm

21:34.669 --> 21:37.130
to teach and offer prayers
and lessons in English.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.091
Sire, if I may...

21:40.174 --> 21:42.218
It is my fervent wish

21:42.510 --> 21:45.346
to give knowledge,
education and opportunity

21:45.471 --> 21:46.889
to the ordinary Saxon folk.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.518
Sire, forgive me, but such matters
are not for you to decide.

21:50.727 --> 21:52.145
You are the king by God's grace,

21:52.353 --> 21:54.814
and with the approval and
blessing of our Holy Church.

21:55.064 --> 21:57.483
But, in matters of religious
practice and observance,

21:57.608 --> 22:01.029
you have no more power to
challenge the Church's authority

22:01.321 --> 22:02.947
than to stop the sea's tide.

22:05.241 --> 22:08.328
My brother, I'm sure, did not
mean to attack the Church.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.288
But I'm not sure
what he did mean.

22:14.917 --> 22:17.337
Give unto Caesar
what belongs to Caesar.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.465
In spiritual matters,
your Grace,

22:20.590 --> 22:23.509
I recognize the supreme
authority to our Holy Churoh,

22:24.052 --> 22:26.429
but the gift of knowledge
belongs to all men.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.222
That is what I meant.

22:28.890 --> 22:31.184
But let us not quarrel now
over such matters,

22:31.267 --> 22:34.062
not while the Northmen encircle
us like ravening wolves.

22:34.645 --> 22:37.982
They are raiding in Scotland, in
Ireland, and all over England.

22:38.358 --> 22:41.152
Just this morning, my lords, before
we assembled, I was informed

22:41.235 --> 22:43.905
that a new army of Danish
Vikings have sailed upriver,

22:43.988 --> 22:46.240
and now threaten
the holy site at Winchester.

22:46.616 --> 22:49.160
We must quickly assemble
an army to defeat them.

22:49.327 --> 22:51.954
And I appoint my brother, Prince
Aethelred, to command them.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.331
And may God help us.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.176
Look.

23:05.718 --> 23:06.761
Holy Jesus.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.622
HOW did you find us?

23:34.747 --> 23:36.833
You know how.

23:38.209 --> 23:40.169
This is where
we all came to hide

23:40.336 --> 23:44.006
<i>when 33“ Borg drove us out of
Kattega't 3“ those years ago.</i>

23:45.716 --> 23:47.343
Why have you come here, Rollo?

23:47.969 --> 23:49.595
To try to save your life.

23:50.972 --> 23:52.181
And Bjorn's life.

23:52.390 --> 23:53.558
How can you do that?

23:53.641 --> 23:56.060
I will give you safe passage
back to Frankia.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.986
Neither Harald
nor Ivar can stop me.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.030
I don't understand.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.407
First of all,

24:09.699 --> 24:12.618
you join with Ivar against us,

24:12.910 --> 24:14.745
you help to defeat us, and now,

24:15.079 --> 24:19.000
for no reason, you offer safe passage?
It doesn't make any sense.

24:20.918 --> 24:24.380
You know perfectly well why I
am here offering you this.

24:25.173 --> 24:26.257
Do I?

24:29.010 --> 24:30.178
Yes.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.681
You know I have always
loved you, Lagertha.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.727
And that Bjorn is my son.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.523
He is not your son.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.942
You cannot deny it to my face.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.694
Can you?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.364
Can you?

24:52.158 --> 24:54.994
You see, I have thought
about this moment

24:55.077 --> 24:57.455
so many times, Lagertha.

24:58.289 --> 25:01.876
And I know you can
never deny the truth.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.739
Do you suppose I could ever have
talked about this to Bjorn?

25:07.798 --> 25:08.883
Of course not.
And I don't.

25:08.966 --> 25:10.009
Neither have I.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.844
And I'm not gonna start now.

25:19.644 --> 25:21.646
You two have been
here a long time.

25:39.330 --> 25:42.750
I am here to offer you and your
mother safe passage back to Frankia.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.210
Why?

25:46.504 --> 25:47.505
You...

25:54.053 --> 25:55.429
You're my son.

25:58.975 --> 26:01.060
I have heard something
to that effect.

26:01.644 --> 26:03.562
But rumors are a doubtful truth.

26:03.729 --> 26:06.107
We had a very
special relationship

26:06.190 --> 26:07.900
together when you were a child.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.236
It was as if you knew...

26:14.407 --> 26:15.992
You may be my father,

26:17.034 --> 26:18.703
but then again, you may not.

26:19.287 --> 26:20.997
At the time of my conception,

26:21.080 --> 26:22.516
you may have been
laying with my mother,

26:22.540 --> 26:24.458
but then again, so was Ragnar.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.752
So, who do I look most like?

26:28.629 --> 26:30.548
Who do I resemble most,

26:31.632 --> 26:33.301
in spirit and principle?

26:33.467 --> 26:35.970
Ah, now, that is
of most importance,

26:36.053 --> 26:38.556
and for that, undoubtably,

26:38.639 --> 26:39.765
Ragnan

26:41.809 --> 26:43.060
Rollo,

26:43.853 --> 26:47.398
I don't want to have
some lifelong battle

26:49.150 --> 26:51.027
like you had with my father.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.532
You are not important enough
for me to care.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.076
And I understand that.

27:01.495 --> 27:03.914
But I am not
fighting you, Bjorn.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.958
Do not just dismiss this offer.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.753
Come back to Frankia with me.

27:09.337 --> 27:11.380
You'll have everything you need,

27:11.464 --> 27:13.215
everything you ever wanted.

27:13.883 --> 27:16.052
I will make sure of that.

27:17.011 --> 27:18.637
Your life there

27:19.847 --> 27:21.307
would be so sweet.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.560
For the love I bear your mother,

27:24.643 --> 27:26.479
at least let me do that for you.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.940
You made your decision regarding
your stance with Ivar.

27:45.956 --> 27:47.166
Can we believe his offer?

27:53.339 --> 27:54.340
Bjorn...

27:58.052 --> 27:59.512
I'm going to kill him.

28:01.889 --> 28:03.265
He betrayed us.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.809
He betrayed my father.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.061
You nearly died
because of him, Lagertha.

28:07.353 --> 28:08.687
Because of his treachery.

28:09.271 --> 28:11.607
And then, he betrays us

28:11.816 --> 28:13.526
for a second time with Ivar.

28:14.527 --> 28:16.278
You must be Bishop Heahmund.

28:17.113 --> 28:18.697
And you, Count Rollo.

28:19.573 --> 28:20.991
A fellow Christian.

28:22.326 --> 28:23.661
"Praise ye the Lord.

28:24.787 --> 28:27.081
"Blessed is the man that walk
in feareth of the Lord

28:27.456 --> 28:29.208
"and delights greatly
in his commandments."

28:29.375 --> 28:30.751
It is true,

28:31.043 --> 28:32.711
I try to follow
his Commandments.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.466
I try to walk in the ways
of mercy and forgiveness.

28:37.800 --> 28:42.179
And now, you all
calmly sit here and suggest

28:42.263 --> 28:44.765
that we merely
give ourselves to his mercy.

28:44.849 --> 28:46.308
Have you no pride?

28:49.812 --> 28:51.439
Are we afraid to die?

28:51.856 --> 28:53.190
Not me.

28:53.649 --> 28:56.652
Give me your blessing,
Bishop Heahmund.

28:57.862 --> 29:00.364
For my sins are
too numerous to count.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.132
Ifl kill Rollo,

29:19.550 --> 29:21.302
then I will die a happy man.

29:23.596 --> 29:24.889
Bjorn, Bjorn...

29:25.097 --> 29:26.348
Bjorn, wait.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.225
Now's not the time.

29:31.604 --> 29:32.605
Bjorn!

29:36.108 --> 29:37.443
No.
Stop.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.321
Leave him.

29:42.323 --> 29:45.242
If you want to kill me, kill me.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.211
You are not worth
the time it takes

29:55.294 --> 29:57.171
to clean the blood off my ax.

30:04.595 --> 30:06.138
We refuse your offer.

30:06.889 --> 30:08.098
I am sorry.

30:10.476 --> 30:11.852
Now leave, traitor.

30:24.657 --> 30:26.408
We will never meet again.

30:36.377 --> 30:37.545
Did you find them?

30:41.340 --> 30:42.341
Yes.

30:44.093 --> 30:45.427
Where are they, Rollo?

30:46.178 --> 30:47.429
I could tell you,

30:48.722 --> 30:50.307
but before I do,

30:52.476 --> 30:53.727
we must discuss our deal.

30:57.856 --> 31:02.736
You will agree to pay me
in yearly tribute

31:05.531 --> 31:07.449
6,000 pounds of silver,

31:07.992 --> 31:11.245
2,000 Roman solidi in gold.

31:12.913 --> 31:15.165
You will supply me with

31:16.041 --> 31:19.128
5,000 pounds weight in furs,
tusks, pelts.

31:19.587 --> 31:20.671
Also,

31:21.839 --> 31:23.382
1,000 slaves,

31:24.466 --> 31:27.219
200 tons of meat,
and every year,

31:28.804 --> 31:30.723
300 precious stones

31:31.640 --> 31:34.893
and 100 ells of silk.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.147
You'll also provide me with 500

31:38.230 --> 31:40.899
of your best warriors
for my own personal guard.

31:42.860 --> 31:46.822
And I want each of you to swear,

31:47.531 --> 31:48.782
on your arm rings,

31:51.118 --> 31:53.162
that you'll come
to my assistance

31:53.245 --> 31:55.706
if I am ever attacked.

31:57.124 --> 31:59.293
You ask an enormously
high price.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.545
For I am in a position to do so.

33:06.443 --> 33:07.653
I know you.

33:08.529 --> 33:09.530
Don't I?

33:12.825 --> 33:14.034
Margrethe.

34:02.082 --> 34:04.918
I fear I have already made
an enemy of the Church.

34:08.005 --> 34:11.008
A king has many
enemies, but few friends.

34:12.009 --> 34:13.469
That is why
he must do all he can

34:13.552 --> 34:16.638
to consolidate his rule before
it can be truly threatened.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.682
How does he do that?

34:19.516 --> 34:20.976
He produces heirs.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.438
He creates a dynasty.

34:24.646 --> 34:28.150
Just as Ecbert did
in all his wisdom.

34:30.152 --> 34:31.695
Well, I am not married.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.238
Nor yet wish to be.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.200
Can there not be a pause
before I choose a bride?

34:36.325 --> 34:38.076
Can we not put wars
before weddings?

34:38.327 --> 34:41.789
That would be foolish, Alfred.

34:42.164 --> 34:45.542
Without a living heir, you are much
more vulnerable than you know.

34:45.918 --> 34:48.295
Then tell me, Mother,
who am I to marry?

34:48.587 --> 34:51.048
You need not concern
yourself with that.

34:53.634 --> 34:55.636
I will find you
a suitable bride.

34:58.055 --> 35:00.265
Yes, I thought you'd say that.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.700
Ha!

36:03.745 --> 36:04.997
Whoa!

36:05.080 --> 36:06.748
So, you didn't find them?

36:07.916 --> 36:09.668
No, they were gone.

36:10.252 --> 36:11.420
Except this one.

36:12.212 --> 36:13.547
They left her behind.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.341
Why is she bound?

36:17.175 --> 36:19.303
Because she is mad.

36:20.596 --> 36:21.597
Hvitserk.

36:22.014 --> 36:23.223
You know her, don't you?

36:24.057 --> 36:25.392
Of course I remember.

36:26.643 --> 36:28.395
Hey, Margrethe.

36:32.983 --> 36:34.192
It's all right.

36:34.902 --> 36:35.903
It's all right.

36:35.986 --> 36:37.237
I won't hurt you.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.489
What say you to her, brother?

36:40.115 --> 36:42.200
Some evil spirit
has possessed her.

36:45.162 --> 36:46.330
She will kill you.

36:47.164 --> 36:48.457
I'll take my chance.

36:49.583 --> 36:51.585
Well, maybe you
have gone crazy too.

37:34.378 --> 37:35.671
<i>Whom Whoo'.!</i>

37:36.505 --> 37:37.631
<i>Whom Whoo'.!</i>

37:37.714 --> 37:39.007
Look what we got.

37:43.679 --> 37:44.930
What sound does the sheep make?

37:45.013 --> 37:46.598
Yes.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.644
You meant what
you said, didn't you?

37:51.269 --> 37:52.521
What I said?

37:52.938 --> 37:54.606
That you would protect us.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.318
Not feed us to the wolves.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.529
Why would I lie to you?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.573
Because you are back in England.

38:03.865 --> 38:04.866
Yeah.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.787
Because it makes
everything different.

38:12.708 --> 38:13.875
Are you afraid

38:14.710 --> 38:15.836
that I'll betray you?

38:16.294 --> 38:17.379
Not afraid.

38:19.381 --> 38:20.507
I just wonder.

38:20.841 --> 38:22.134
Why would I betray you?

38:24.136 --> 38:25.595
I love you.

38:36.106 --> 38:37.399
Forgive me, my King.

38:43.363 --> 38:44.614
No more mistakes.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.283
Hmm?
Mmm-hmm.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.054
Please.

39:08.972 --> 39:10.390
Don't just stand there, come in.

39:21.818 --> 39:23.195
Sit.

39:31.161 --> 39:32.370
How are you?

39:34.498 --> 39:36.541
I've been thinking about you.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.002
Are you married?

39:40.253 --> 39:41.254
No.

39:42.339 --> 39:43.423
I'm not married.

39:44.674 --> 39:45.717
I live alone.

39:46.968 --> 39:48.053
I like it that way.

39:49.763 --> 39:51.056
You freed me,

39:51.264 --> 39:53.767
and so, I live freely.

39:54.768 --> 39:56.478
With no man in my life.

39:57.145 --> 39:58.605
With no obligations.

39:59.481 --> 40:00.482
No ties.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.235
I don't even know your name.

40:03.944 --> 40:05.362
My name is Freydis.

40:07.948 --> 40:09.157
Like Freya.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.287
I've never forgotten
what you told me.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.206
It's true what I told you.

40:16.998 --> 40:18.875
You're a very
special person, Ivar.

40:21.378 --> 40:22.879
It is still hard for

40:23.296 --> 40:24.589
me to believe that.

40:26.341 --> 40:28.260
All my life has been a struggle.

40:29.803 --> 40:31.513
A war against myself.

40:31.638 --> 40:33.557
But look what you have
already accomplished.

40:34.724 --> 40:36.601
The gods have marked you out.

40:37.769 --> 40:38.979
You are favored,

40:39.896 --> 40:41.231
above all men.

40:42.274 --> 40:43.316
Even so.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.321
I'm in daily danger
of being killed.

40:48.905 --> 40:49.906
Killed?

40:51.283 --> 40:52.284
By who?

40:53.869 --> 40:55.829
Can I speak honestly

40:56.413 --> 40:57.789
and openly to you?

40:58.707 --> 41:01.543
Somehow I feel I can trust you.

41:03.753 --> 41:05.964
Perhaps even more than
anybody else here.

41:07.841 --> 41:09.009
You can trust me.

41:09.801 --> 41:12.387
I would give my life for you
if you asked me to.

41:14.556 --> 41:15.765
You know that.

41:17.517 --> 41:18.852
How can I help you?

41:19.644 --> 41:21.187
What do you want me to do?

43:14.259 --> 43:15.468
Murderers!

43:40.160 --> 43:41.619
Murderers!
