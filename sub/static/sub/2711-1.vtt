01:29.913 --> 01:32.552
<i>Rome, master of the earth,</i>

01:32.633 --> 01:35.511
<i>in the 18th year of the emperor Tiberius.</i>

01:36.153 --> 01:39.350
<i>Our legions stand guard
on the boundaries of civilisation</i>

01:39.433 --> 01:43.904
<i>from the foggy coasts of the northern seas
to the ancient rivers of Babylon,</i>

01:43.993 --> 01:47.030
<i>the finest fighting machines in history.</i>

01:47.793 --> 01:54.062
<i>The people of 30 lands send us tribute:
their gold and silk, ivory and frankincense,</i>

01:55.673 --> 01:58.585
<i>and their proudest sons to be our slaves.</i>

01:58.673 --> 02:02.825
<i>We have reached the point where there
are more slaves in Rome than citizens.</i>

02:02.913 --> 02:06.030
<i>Some say we are only looters
of what others have created,</i>

02:06.113 --> 02:08.263
<i>that we create nothing ourselves.</i>

02:08.353 --> 02:12.028
<i>But we have made gods,
fine gods and goddesses,</i>

02:12.513 --> 02:14.265
<i>who make love</i>

02:14.353 --> 02:16.025
<i>and war.</i>

02:16.673 --> 02:18.550
<i>Huntresses</i>

02:18.633 --> 02:20.669
<i>and drunkards.</i>

02:20.753 --> 02:25.144
<i>But the power lies not in their hands
of marble, but in ours of flesh.</i>

02:25.713 --> 02:30.264
<i>We, the nobles of Rome, are free
to live only for our own pleasure.</i>

02:30.353 --> 02:33.026
<i>Could any god offer us more?</i>

02:33.113 --> 02:35.343
<i>Today we traffic in human souls.</i>

02:35.753 --> 02:40.747
<i>The slave market is crowded because the
emperor's heir and regent, young Caligula,</i>

02:40.833 --> 02:43.393
<i>is coming to buy gladiators.</i>

02:43.473 --> 02:46.271
<i>He probably will not be pleased to see me.</i>

03:07.513 --> 03:10.152
Look here, look here. A singer, a dancer,

03:10.233 --> 03:14.067
a companion for a noble lady,
or a noble gentleman.

03:14.153 --> 03:17.782
Stop, gentlemen.
A priceless gem for your household.

03:17.873 --> 03:20.626
Look here, look here. A singer, a dancer,

03:20.713 --> 03:23.511
a companion for a noble lady
or a noble gentleman.

03:23.593 --> 03:26.426
A physician from Egypt.
Question him if you like.

03:26.513 --> 03:30.665
Stop and look. Stop and look.
A jewel, a jewel from the East.

03:30.753 --> 03:33.711
You've heard of the beauty
of the Circassians. Look.

03:33.793 --> 03:36.865
A beauty from Circassia. Stop and look.

03:36.953 --> 03:39.103
Buy young and train them yourself.

03:39.193 --> 03:42.390
Children grow into men and women.
These Goths grow strong.

03:42.473 --> 03:45.670
Buy young. Buy young
and train them yourself.

03:45.753 --> 03:50.349
Too old? Why, he's still got
ten or fifteen years left in him.

03:50.433 --> 03:52.901
He costs no more than an ox,
and cheaper to feed.

03:52.993 --> 03:57.191
A pair to touch the heart of any buyer.
A mother and child from Syria.

03:57.273 --> 04:01.425
Buy them together. Buy them separately.
Smile. What's the matter with you?

04:02.273 --> 04:05.470
Tribune. You came. I have them. Wait.

04:05.553 --> 04:07.111
Girls. Girls.

04:07.193 --> 04:09.946
Look. Two identical rubies. They're perfect.

04:10.033 --> 04:13.708
And this one is a hairdresser.
She's an expert. Look at her hands.

04:14.953 --> 04:17.865
- Very nice. Aren't they nice, Livia?
- Let go of me.

04:17.952 --> 04:21.070
- I apologise for last night...
- Anything you say will be a lie.

04:21.153 --> 04:24.031
Slave loose! Slave loose!

04:41.713 --> 04:44.227
Thank you, Tribune.

04:44.313 --> 04:48.226
A tribune. So today in Rome a tribune
does the vile work of a slave master.

04:48.313 --> 04:52.147
Fool. Will you never learn? This is
Senator Gallio's son you're speaking to.

04:52.233 --> 04:55.111
- Down on your...
- What's this? Tried it again?

04:55.193 --> 04:59.823
Give me his slate. "Highborn, educated,
qualified for household steward. "

04:59.913 --> 05:04.987
Sell him for lion bait. Put him up
as a gladiator. Never mind the price.

05:05.073 --> 05:08.031
But, Cleander, Caligula's
buying gladiators today.

05:08.153 --> 05:10.986
- What of it?
- He'll get this Greek for nothing.

05:11.073 --> 05:14.622
- He's worth 1,000 pieces of gold.
- He's worth his weight in dog's meat.

05:14.713 --> 05:17.022
- Please.
- A gladiator. You heard me.

05:17.833 --> 05:20.267
You animal. Animal!

05:20.353 --> 05:23.425
Did you hear what he said? Lion bait.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.110
- I'm sorry. What were you saying?
- There's nothing more to say.

05:29.193 --> 05:32.310
After last night you'll never hear
another word out of me.

05:32.393 --> 05:37.342
In front of my friends, too. I know you
were drunk as a pig, but that's no excuse.

05:37.433 --> 05:41.312
Do you realise you've made me
the laughing stock of Rome, Marcellus?

05:41.393 --> 05:43.588
Marcellus Gallio.

05:47.033 --> 05:49.149
Don't think I won't talk about this.

05:49.233 --> 05:51.622
- I intend to.
- Yes.

06:04.273 --> 06:06.264
It's good to see you, Marcellus.

06:06.353 --> 06:09.151
It's good to see you again.

06:09.593 --> 06:11.823
Then you do remember me.

06:12.793 --> 06:17.230
Yes, of course. Let me see now, it was the...

06:17.313 --> 06:20.510
And your promise.
Have you forgotten that too?

06:20.593 --> 06:23.153
What promise?

06:23.233 --> 06:25.428
To marry me.

06:26.433 --> 06:28.628
Was I drunk?

06:29.353 --> 06:32.151
That's not very flattering, Marcellus.

06:32.713 --> 06:37.150
If you'd tell me when I was supposed
to have said this - the circumstances.

06:38.033 --> 06:42.424
I remember them perfectly.
I'd cut my finger, and I cried.

06:42.513 --> 06:47.143
You took a dagger and cut your own finger
to show me that it didn't really hurt.

06:47.233 --> 06:50.111
Then you kissed me and I stopped crying,

06:50.193 --> 06:53.708
and then you promised
to marry me when we grew up.

06:55.233 --> 06:56.586
Diana.

06:58.913 --> 07:01.791
- Where have your freckles gone?
- I lost them.

07:01.873 --> 07:05.183
- I loved every one of them.
- Then I'm sorry I lost them.

07:05.273 --> 07:07.662
Let me look at you.

07:10.073 --> 07:14.589
12 years... The gods must love Capri
to make you blossom so.

07:14.673 --> 07:17.233
- What are you doing in Rome?
- Tiberius sent me.

07:17.313 --> 07:20.032
Since my father died
I've been the ward of the emperor.

07:20.113 --> 07:24.948
- Yes, this is Caligula's pavilion.
- Empress Julia thinks I'd be good for him.

07:25.033 --> 07:27.069
Caligula? You can't.

07:27.153 --> 07:31.032
He'll be emperor someday, and...
Would that matter, Marcellus, to you?

07:31.113 --> 07:33.343
More than my life. After all, I promised you.

07:33.433 --> 07:36.869
And you'll never know
how seriously I took your promise.

07:36.953 --> 07:39.706
Do you intend to hold me to it, Diana?

07:39.793 --> 07:43.911
I might. But I've heard
that you've made other promises since.

07:43.993 --> 07:45.984
But only one vow to Diana.

07:53.753 --> 07:56.028
He's coming, Marcellus. You'd better go.

07:56.113 --> 08:00.743
Caligula and I have been in competition
before, and I've never lost to him.

08:00.833 --> 08:04.712
- At least you're frank, Marcellus.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.

08:04.793 --> 08:07.227
Then all the tales I've heard of you are true.

08:07.313 --> 08:11.704
- Every man makes enemies.
- All your enemies seem to be women.

08:12.553 --> 08:14.509
Yes.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.702
Begin the sale.

08:45.913 --> 08:49.428
And why is Tribune Gallio in my pavilion?
Does he seek a favour?

08:49.513 --> 08:54.143
I invited him, sire. We were friends
many years ago when we were children.

08:54.233 --> 08:56.463
Buying today, or looking for amusement?

08:56.553 --> 08:59.351
Buying, I hope, sire. A pair of twins.

08:59.433 --> 09:02.072
- Male or female?
- Female.

09:03.393 --> 09:05.782
- Have them put up first.
- Sire.

09:08.433 --> 09:11.550
No. Sit down, here with me.

09:12.913 --> 09:15.188
You're very kind, sire.

09:15.593 --> 09:18.505
The pleasure of our loyal tribune
is important to us.

09:18.593 --> 09:22.586
You have such excellent taste.
These twins must be charming.

09:27.193 --> 09:29.263
We have here two Macedonian twins,

09:29.353 --> 09:33.824
trained as companions, entertainers,
servant for a highborn lady.

09:33.913 --> 09:37.667
Only once a year can their like
be found on the auction blocks of Rome.

09:37.753 --> 09:40.028
They won't be sold separately.
What am I bid?

09:40.113 --> 09:42.024
500 gold pieces.

09:42.113 --> 09:43.705
1,000.

09:43.793 --> 09:45.943
1200.

09:46.033 --> 09:47.864
1300.

09:48.273 --> 09:50.503
- Don't lose them, Gallio.
- 1500.

09:52.273 --> 09:54.548
1600.

09:54.953 --> 09:58.468
- Marcellus, are you my friend or aren't you?
- Not to this extent.

09:58.553 --> 10:02.262
- 2,000.
- The bid stands at 2,000 pieces of gold.

10:02.793 --> 10:04.784
2500.

10:06.833 --> 10:09.301
- You bid for yourself?
- No.

10:10.113 --> 10:12.581
Sold for 2500.

10:13.393 --> 10:17.272
Forgive me, Gallio, but I have
decided to give them to the lady Diana.

10:17.353 --> 10:20.151
- But, sire...
- You wouldn't refuse me?

10:20.993 --> 10:22.426
No, sire.

10:24.353 --> 10:29.427
Offered as a gladiator, a Greek.
I guarantee his strength and fighting spirit.

10:29.513 --> 10:32.027
- Buy him.
- 50 gold pieces.

10:32.273 --> 10:34.912
- 50.
- Dog's meat!

10:35.793 --> 10:38.182
There are no more bids. Get on with the sale.

10:38.273 --> 10:40.150
100.

10:40.233 --> 10:43.111
- You bid against me?
- Against Tribune Quintus.

10:43.193 --> 10:46.549
- Be careful, Tribune.
- The Greek is well-qualified, sire.

10:46.633 --> 10:49.466
- He's worth a better price.
- 200 gold pieces.

10:49.553 --> 10:52.943
- 300.
- You want to make a gift of him to me?

10:53.033 --> 10:55.103
No, sire. I want him.

10:55.193 --> 10:57.502
And I bid against Quintus.

10:58.513 --> 11:00.822
- 500.
- 700.

11:00.913 --> 11:02.904
- 800.
- 900.

11:04.313 --> 11:06.508
1,000.

11:06.913 --> 11:08.983
3,000.

11:10.473 --> 11:13.351
The bid is 3,000 pieces of gold.

11:15.233 --> 11:19.624
A little high, but I expected
to spend more on the twins.

11:21.313 --> 11:23.463
You offend me, Tribune.

11:23.553 --> 11:26.351
I think it's time you offend me no more.

11:26.913 --> 11:29.302
Detail! March!

11:40.633 --> 11:43.431
Sold to Tribune Gallio.

11:48.633 --> 11:51.943
A wonderful purchase, sir,
even though you may have to beat him.

11:52.033 --> 11:54.467
- Yes. Unchain him.
- Sir?

11:54.553 --> 11:57.021
- Unchain him.
- But he's a dangerous man.

11:57.113 --> 11:59.502
- Unchain him.
- Yes, sir.

12:06.473 --> 12:08.748
What's your name?

12:08.833 --> 12:11.028
Demetrius, from Corinth.

12:11.993 --> 12:16.942
At the end of the street you'll find
the house of my father, Senator Gallio.

12:17.033 --> 12:20.230
It has a scarlet door.
Report to the steward there.

12:38.953 --> 12:42.184
There are times
when I'm away with Senator Gallio.

12:42.273 --> 12:47.267
In that case, the slave attending
the front door is required to light the lamps.

12:49.753 --> 12:52.711
To be a slave in this household
is an honour.

12:52.793 --> 12:55.182
To be a slave anywhere is to be a dog.

12:56.953 --> 12:59.751
The door. Open it. Remember to bow.

13:00.593 --> 13:02.982
The door. Run, you fool.

13:04.153 --> 13:07.111
- Good evening, Marcipor.
- Good evening, sir.

13:07.193 --> 13:08.546
It's you.

13:08.633 --> 13:12.228
No household duties.
He'll be my personal attendant.

13:16.513 --> 13:19.186
You could have run away. Why didn't you?

13:19.593 --> 13:22.107
I owe you a debt, sir. I pay my debts.

13:22.953 --> 13:25.786
- Not a slave's reason. More like a Roman's.
- A Greek's.

13:25.873 --> 13:31.391
Yes, I know. In the great days of Greece,
we Romans were no more than barbarians.

13:31.473 --> 13:36.422
Have Marcipor show you where I keep
my clothes. I'll change before dinner.

13:38.193 --> 13:40.991
Good evening, Mother. Lucia.

13:41.073 --> 13:43.428
Sorry, Mother, I was outbid for those twins.

13:43.513 --> 13:45.822
- We know, Marcellus.
- Diana was here.

13:45.913 --> 13:48.746
Diana? You should have
kept her till I got home.

13:48.833 --> 13:52.382
Marcellus. She told us that
you and Caligula had a quarrel...

13:52.473 --> 13:56.307
- Don't worry about that.
- Caligula's very angry.

13:56.393 --> 13:58.748
- She takes him too seriously.
- She has to.

13:58.833 --> 14:01.393
- She's going to marry him.
- Did she tell you that?

14:01.473 --> 14:04.829
Mother, look. I think
he's in love with her himself.

14:04.913 --> 14:10.146
Love's like wine. A sip hurts nobody, but
to empty the bottle is to invite a headache.

14:10.233 --> 14:13.589
Well, you won't even get a taste.
She thinks you're very funny.

14:13.673 --> 14:16.983
- She does?
- She thought you wanted the twins.

14:17.073 --> 14:19.507
- Lucia.
- That's what she said, Mother.

14:21.073 --> 14:26.101
Marcellus. Are you deliberately trying
to cut the ground from under my feet,

14:26.193 --> 14:29.105
orjust too much of a fool
to understand what you've done?

14:29.193 --> 14:31.661
You mean my difference
of opinion with Caligula?

14:31.753 --> 14:35.905
I lead the senators who oppose him, and my
son makes fun of him at private banquets,

14:35.993 --> 14:38.302
and now humiliates him in public.

14:38.393 --> 14:41.783
I'm fighting for the republic
against the tyranny of the emperors.

14:41.873 --> 14:43.989
- I know that.
- You know nothing.

14:44.073 --> 14:46.143
Nothing but dice and women.

14:46.233 --> 14:49.589
And now, by your behaviour
to Caligula, by these petty slights,

14:49.673 --> 14:53.951
you cripple me, make my fight
look like a personal quarrel.

14:54.553 --> 14:57.351
- Yes?
- Sir, Tribune Quintus is at the door.

14:57.433 --> 14:58.912
- For me?
- For your son.

14:58.993 --> 15:01.382
- I'm not at home.
- Yes, sir.

15:05.953 --> 15:09.946
Your leave. Give this to Tribune Gallio
when he does come home.

15:11.273 --> 15:13.628
Well, aren't you going to read it?

15:13.713 --> 15:15.704
After dinner.

15:15.793 --> 15:17.988
Good eating to you.

15:19.593 --> 15:21.948
Ladies. Senator Gallio.

15:27.433 --> 15:29.503
Quintus is a very important man.

15:29.593 --> 15:31.504
He was already my enemy.

15:40.033 --> 15:42.593
- May we know?
- It's from Caligula.

15:43.833 --> 15:48.384
"The courage of a military tribune must not
be squandered in baths and banquet halls. "

15:48.473 --> 15:50.862
"You are ordered
to the garrison at Jerusalem. "

15:50.953 --> 15:54.946
- Jerusalem.
- "You sail tonight on the Palestine galley. "

15:56.953 --> 16:00.741
That's all. Not even
an expression of his tender regard.

16:03.593 --> 16:06.551
Cornelia, he will need his things.

16:08.913 --> 16:11.222
Help your mother, Lucia.

16:19.953 --> 16:22.183
Where's Jerusalem?

16:22.273 --> 16:24.468
Palestine.

16:25.073 --> 16:27.462
The worst pest-hole in the empire.

16:29.353 --> 16:33.471
A stiff-necked, riotous people
always on the verge of rebellion.

16:33.553 --> 16:38.024
Our legions there are the scum of the army,
the officers little better than the men.

16:38.113 --> 16:40.502
Disease takes them off like flies.

16:41.513 --> 16:44.710
Some have been assassinated,
sometimes by their own men.

16:44.793 --> 16:47.785
Others have spared the assassins the trouble.

16:48.473 --> 16:52.182
What Caligula hopes he has given you
is your death sentence.

16:53.873 --> 16:56.751
- "We who are about to die"?
- Marcellus.

16:58.073 --> 17:00.985
Marcellus, you are
the only son I'll ever have.

17:02.153 --> 17:04.906
You know what my ambitions
have been for you.

17:05.593 --> 17:07.503
I know how I've disappointed you.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.060
Try to endure it, Marcellus.

17:10.153 --> 17:12.223
Grow hard.

17:12.313 --> 17:15.305
Watch the hand of the man
who walks behind you.

17:15.913 --> 17:19.701
Drink in private and sleep
with your sword at your side.

17:19.792 --> 17:22.102
Take nothing on faith.

17:22.512 --> 17:24.821
Bind yourself to no man.

17:25.953 --> 17:28.387
Above all, be a Roman, my son,

17:28.993 --> 17:31.188
and be a man of honour.

17:35.353 --> 17:39.141
Perhaps there'll be amusement
in being a man of honour.

17:56.153 --> 17:58.986
- Ready, sir?
- Yes, that's the last of my gear.

17:59.833 --> 18:02.631
Ready at the oars.

18:04.313 --> 18:06.622
Man the lines.

18:10.513 --> 18:12.902
Careful with that, it's the wine.

18:13.273 --> 18:15.503
Yes, sir.

18:15.753 --> 18:18.551
There's no need to be so formal, Demetrius.

18:19.633 --> 18:22.067
We'll both need friends where we're going.

18:22.153 --> 18:26.146
Friends can't be bought, sir,
even for 3,000 pieces of gold.

18:26.833 --> 18:28.949
Is there anything else you want, sir?

18:29.033 --> 18:31.024
No.

18:33.873 --> 18:37.661
The lady Diana begs a word with you, sir,
before you leave.

18:40.913 --> 18:43.302
We don't want to lose this tide, sir.

18:53.473 --> 18:55.304
Diana.

18:55.393 --> 18:57.987
I came to tell you that I'm going back to Capri

18:58.073 --> 19:00.667
to ask the emperor to intercede for you.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.309
Why?

19:03.633 --> 19:06.022
I think Caligula treated you unjustly.

19:06.113 --> 19:08.263
Why, Diana?

19:08.353 --> 19:10.787
It was partly my fault what happened.

19:10.873 --> 19:13.068
The real reason.

19:15.113 --> 19:18.708
Because I've found you again,
and I don't want to lose you.

19:19.433 --> 19:23.631
Perhaps you don't believe that
a girl of 11 could fall in love

19:23.713 --> 19:26.102
and stay in love all these years.

19:31.433 --> 19:33.424
Tribune.

19:36.153 --> 19:38.348
Don't cry, my love.

19:39.673 --> 19:42.062
Lucia thought I was in love.

19:42.153 --> 19:45.941
I laughed at her,
but women are wise in these matters.

19:48.833 --> 19:51.222
Tribune. We'll miss the tide.

19:56.313 --> 20:00.101
Make Tiberius promise
not to give you to Caligula

20:01.353 --> 20:03.548
until I come back.

20:14.193 --> 20:16.388
Cast off.

20:19.513 --> 20:22.505
- Pull up.
- Lines are up.

20:22.873 --> 20:25.068
Start the oars.

21:39.913 --> 21:42.586
Jerusalem's no pleasure resort at its best.

21:42.673 --> 21:46.143
This is the worst,
the feast they call the Passover.

21:46.233 --> 21:49.464
This is when their soothsayers
tell them the Messiah will come.

21:49.553 --> 21:53.512
- Messiah? What's that?
- King. Saviour. Redeemer.

21:54.113 --> 21:56.946
Son of their god - and general troublemaker.

21:57.473 --> 21:59.862
- He's coming here?
- No one knows.

21:59.953 --> 22:02.069
No one knows if he even exists.

22:02.153 --> 22:05.987
He is, but he isn't.
He hasn't come yet, but he's coming.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.984
Every year the same.

22:09.513 --> 22:12.664
You'll find out, Tribune,
if you live long enough.

22:12.753 --> 22:15.187
Thanks for the kind wish, Centurion.

22:17.673 --> 22:19.948
The Messiah.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.548
There he is.

22:37.273 --> 22:40.868
What stirred them up?
Perhaps he's coming after all, the Messiah.

22:40.953 --> 22:43.228
Something's happening, that's certain.

22:43.313 --> 22:46.703
Look. There. Those people carrying palms.

22:47.393 --> 22:49.668
The man riding a white donkey. See him?

22:55.193 --> 22:58.310
Flavius, clear us a path through these cattle.

23:33.993 --> 23:37.349
Demetrius, come along.
Your master will have you flogged.

23:37.433 --> 23:39.310
- Did you see him?
- Who?

23:39.393 --> 23:42.146
- The man who just rode past.
- I was over there.

23:42.233 --> 23:45.111
He stopped here and looked at me.
He looked into my eyes.

23:45.193 --> 23:47.423
- What did he want?
- I don't know.

23:48.233 --> 23:51.191
I thought he was going to speak
but he didn't.

23:51.673 --> 23:53.868
Only his eyes spoke.

23:54.473 --> 23:56.668
Come on, Demetrius.

23:56.753 --> 23:58.948
I think he wants me to follow him.

23:59.033 --> 24:01.308
- Who is he? A general?
- No.

24:02.113 --> 24:05.105
- A king?
- No, he's not a king.

24:06.313 --> 24:08.304
He's...

24:08.793 --> 24:10.988
I don't know.

24:25.633 --> 24:28.466
This is for the tribune. It's very important.

24:32.313 --> 24:34.588
Excuse me. Let me pass, please.

24:42.793 --> 24:45.182
Here you are, Tribune, just as I promised you.

24:45.273 --> 24:48.310
The finest Syrian wine
from the vintage you like the best.

24:48.393 --> 24:51.146
And now, Tribune, there's
a little matter of payment.

24:51.233 --> 24:54.270
One, two, three, four
skins of wine you owe me for.

24:54.353 --> 24:56.867
Four skins of wine for four days, remember?

24:56.953 --> 24:58.944
Who are you?

24:59.033 --> 25:02.070
Who am I?
The tribune has a sense of humour.

25:02.153 --> 25:04.621
- He asks me who I am.
- Ever seen this man before?

25:04.713 --> 25:06.066
- No, never.
- Never, sire.

25:06.153 --> 25:10.783
Gentlemen, please. Please. I am Caleb,
Caleb the wine merchant. Remember?

25:10.873 --> 25:14.104
I'm an honest man.
The tribune and I have an agreement.

25:14.193 --> 25:16.787
A skin of wine every day.
Don't you remember?

25:16.873 --> 25:19.467
Please, gentlemen.
I want my money. I'm a poor man.

25:19.553 --> 25:21.783
You're not poor. You're as rich as Midas.

25:21.873 --> 25:24.626
And you're not honest. You're a thief.

25:24.713 --> 25:27.830
- Then you do recognise me.
- As for being a wine merchant...

25:27.913 --> 25:30.985
The stuff you sell isn't fit for a jackass.

25:31.073 --> 25:32.791
Thank you.

25:32.873 --> 25:34.511
Oh, dear.

25:34.593 --> 25:36.788
Tribune, what have you done?

25:48.833 --> 25:50.232
Enjoying yourself?

25:50.313 --> 25:53.146
Whoever conquered this land
should have been strung up.

25:53.233 --> 25:57.067
- Demetrius, pour us some of this poison.
- The curse of empire.

25:57.153 --> 26:00.702
But think how we make it possible
for those in Rome to enjoy themselves.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.784
I am thinking about it.

26:02.873 --> 26:05.512
Pilate's given orders to arrest that fanatic.

26:05.593 --> 26:07.709
Remember? The day you arrived?

26:07.793 --> 26:10.068
Yes, the Messiah. What did he do?

26:10.153 --> 26:12.667
He's been preaching,
stirring up a commotion.

26:12.753 --> 26:15.062
- Why don't you arrest him?
- It's not easy.

26:15.153 --> 26:18.941
Pilate wants it done quietly.
The man's got half the people on his side.

26:19.033 --> 26:21.069
We've got to find out where he is at night.

26:21.153 --> 26:25.146
And that is like finding
one particular ant in an ant hill.

26:28.193 --> 26:31.185
Vinegar, like the rest of it. I hope you drown.

26:31.953 --> 26:34.592
I don't care how you handle it, Centurion.

26:34.673 --> 26:37.028
Just do your duty.

26:37.113 --> 26:41.265
There's one way that never fails.
But it'll cost you some money.

26:41.353 --> 26:44.151
Demetrius, how much is left in the purse?

26:45.433 --> 26:49.108
- Eight gold pieces and some silver, sir.
- That should be enough.

26:49.193 --> 26:51.582
Give him the purse.

26:51.993 --> 26:55.190
Give him the purse.
What's the matter with you?

27:00.713 --> 27:02.943
I'll report later. Tribune.

27:04.553 --> 27:06.748
Pour me some of that wine.

27:09.393 --> 27:11.384
Demetrius?

27:13.713 --> 27:15.351
Demetrius.

27:49.153 --> 27:51.303
Friend. Friend, could you help me?

27:51.393 --> 27:54.908
I'm looking for the carpenter
from Galilee, the one called Jesus.

27:54.993 --> 27:58.781
- What do you want with him?
- I must warn him. I'm a slave like you are.

27:58.873 --> 28:01.467
You're not even clever, you Roman spy.

28:09.953 --> 28:11.671
Wait.

28:11.753 --> 28:13.948
You. Stop.

28:50.593 --> 28:52.823
- I'm looking for the man called Jesus.
- Who?

28:52.913 --> 28:56.508
- The one they say is the Messiah.
- I never heard of him.

29:26.993 --> 29:29.143
Can you help me? I'm looking for a man.

29:29.433 --> 29:33.346
- A man? What's his name?
- Jesus. I must warn him.

29:33.433 --> 29:36.425
You're too late.
Even now he is before Pilate.

29:37.353 --> 29:40.186
- They found him?
- He was betrayed to them,

29:40.273 --> 29:42.582
and by one he loved and trusted.

29:42.673 --> 29:45.267
By his disciple, who sat at his left hand.

29:47.313 --> 29:49.508
Why?

29:49.833 --> 29:52.267
Because men are weak.

29:52.353 --> 29:55.823
Because they are cursed
with envy and cowardice.

29:55.913 --> 30:00.941
Because they can dream of truth,
but cannot live with it, they doubt.

30:01.673 --> 30:04.312
They doubt, the fools.

30:04.393 --> 30:07.385
Why must men betray
themselves with doubts?

30:08.273 --> 30:12.107
Tell them, the others. Find them
and tell them not to doubt.

30:12.713 --> 30:15.102
Even now, not to doubt.

30:15.913 --> 30:18.108
Tell them to keep their faith.

30:19.273 --> 30:21.548
They must keep faith.

30:21.633 --> 30:23.828
Wait. Tell who?

30:25.313 --> 30:28.305
- Who are you?
- My name is Judas.

30:54.313 --> 30:56.508
Tribune, wake up.

30:56.593 --> 30:58.629
Come on. Do I have to drag you?

30:58.713 --> 31:01.352
Duty calls, if the word
means anything to you.

31:01.433 --> 31:03.788
- What is it?
- The governor wants you.

31:03.873 --> 31:07.661
- At this hour?
- Come. Pilate doesn't like to be kept waiting.

31:22.633 --> 31:25.067
Sir, I need your help.

31:25.993 --> 31:27.984
Where's my helmet?

31:28.753 --> 31:32.826
- I spoke to you of the man Jesus.
- Yes, the fanatic.

31:32.913 --> 31:36.667
- He's been arrested, sir.
- What do you expect me to do about it?

31:36.753 --> 31:39.950
Intercede for him.
Make them see that he's innocent.

31:40.033 --> 31:43.503
No. When his trial comes up, I'll look into it.

31:44.193 --> 31:46.582
What's he supposed to have done?

31:47.233 --> 31:50.862
He's already been tried.
He's been condemned by Pilate himself.

31:50.953 --> 31:52.909
- Pilate?
- You're going there, sir.

31:52.993 --> 31:55.951
If he stains his hands with this blood,
he's a murderer.

31:56.033 --> 32:00.185
That's enough. Pilate's the governor,
the Roman governor.

32:00.273 --> 32:02.662
As far as I'm concerned,
that ends the matter.

32:02.753 --> 32:05.313
- As far as you're concerned, too.
- Ready?

32:05.393 --> 32:07.384
Yes.

32:10.313 --> 32:14.306
For your own good,
you'd better forget you ever saw this man.

32:35.753 --> 32:40.907
- I don't like to be kept waiting, Tribune.
- I'm sorry, sir. I came as soon as I could.

32:40.993 --> 32:43.188
I have special orders for you.

32:43.273 --> 32:45.787
You're to report to the emperor at Capri.

32:46.513 --> 32:49.107
You must have powerful friends at court.

32:49.713 --> 32:53.831
- I suppose I have, sir.
- There'll be a galley at the end of the week.

32:53.913 --> 32:56.791
I have one task before you leave. It's routine.

32:56.873 --> 32:59.262
An execution. Today.

32:59.353 --> 33:01.344
- Three criminals.
- Yes, sir.

33:02.473 --> 33:06.261
One of them's a fanatic. He has a following.
There may be some trouble,

33:06.353 --> 33:08.662
some attempt to interfere.

33:09.473 --> 33:12.033
- Take enough men.
- I understand, sir.

33:12.553 --> 33:17.229
I've had a miserable night. Factions,
no one agreeing with anyone else.

33:17.313 --> 33:19.702
Even my wife had an opinion.

33:22.033 --> 33:24.422
Good luck. I'm sorry to lose you.

33:25.193 --> 33:29.345
- Thank you, sir.
- Give me water to wash my hands.

33:29.433 --> 33:32.231
- But you just washed them, my lord.
- Did I?

33:34.033 --> 33:36.228
So I did.

33:39.673 --> 33:42.346
Some wine before you go, gentlemen?

33:42.433 --> 33:44.663
- No.
- You'd better.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.071
- Your first crucifixion, isn't it?
- Yes.

33:48.793 --> 33:51.785
What? Never driven nails into a man's flesh?

34:24.592 --> 34:26.982
Hail our king. Our king.

34:37.913 --> 34:40.108
Make way.

36:10.233 --> 36:12.224
- Is it night?
- No.

36:12.313 --> 36:14.304
It's the middle of the day.

36:14.393 --> 36:16.668
This isn't like other days.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.904
17.

38:13.353 --> 38:15.548
Your go, Paulus.

38:19.873 --> 38:21.989
Four.

38:22.993 --> 38:25.791
You're lucky today, Tribune. I'm finished.

38:25.873 --> 38:29.468
- I'm always lucky.
- You. Bring me that robe.

38:30.993 --> 38:33.666
- I have a proposition for you, Tribune.
- What?

38:33.753 --> 38:35.948
You'll see.

38:56.153 --> 39:00.351
- Hurry up.
- What's the matter with that slave?

39:00.433 --> 39:04.631
- Where did you find him, Tribune?
- Throw the dice again, Paulus.

39:05.313 --> 39:07.429
Mine by right of possession.

39:07.833 --> 39:12.065
First-class homespun,
previously owned by a carpenter of Galilee.

39:12.793 --> 39:15.182
How much will you risk against it?

39:21.153 --> 39:23.348
- 11.
- Tribune?

39:27.073 --> 39:28.984
17.

39:29.073 --> 39:31.064
Lucky again.

39:33.193 --> 39:36.026
Tribune Gallio's first battle trophy,

39:36.113 --> 39:38.627
for victory over the king of the Jews.

39:38.713 --> 39:41.671
We've done our duty, Centurion.
No need to joke about it.

39:41.753 --> 39:46.065
You can say that. You're going back
to Capri to kiss the emperor's hand.

39:46.153 --> 39:49.111
I have to stay here in this sinkhole.

40:28.833 --> 40:30.551
- Get back to your post.
- Let me go.

40:30.633 --> 40:33.545
- They say the storm's a judgment.
- Superstitious idiot.

40:33.633 --> 40:37.069
- They say he's the Son of God.
- Maybe he is. I don't know.

41:01.873 --> 41:05.946
Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

42:06.913 --> 42:08.949
Throw that cloth over me.

42:09.033 --> 42:12.025
Didn't you hear me?
Throw that cloth over me.

42:18.313 --> 42:20.269
Take it off.

42:20.473 --> 42:22.429
Take it off.

42:22.633 --> 42:24.624
Take it off.

42:27.553 --> 42:29.703
You crucified him.

42:29.793 --> 42:32.102
You, my master.

42:32.193 --> 42:34.627
But you've freed me.

42:34.713 --> 42:37.944
I'll never serve you again, you Roman pig.

42:38.953 --> 42:41.751
Masters of the world, you call yourselves.

42:42.473 --> 42:44.748
Thieves. Murderers.

42:45.553 --> 42:47.748
Jungle animals.

42:47.833 --> 42:50.108
A curse on you.

42:50.633 --> 42:53.101
A curse on your empire.

43:38.953 --> 43:41.148
There it is again, sir.

44:10.793 --> 44:12.784
No.

44:25.033 --> 44:26.944
No. No.

44:27.033 --> 44:29.422
Stop it. Stop it.

44:32.633 --> 44:34.988
Stop it. Why don't you stop it?

44:35.073 --> 44:37.462
- Stop what, sir?
- Were you out there?

44:38.753 --> 44:40.948
Out where, sir?

44:44.313 --> 44:46.463
I'm sorry.

44:46.553 --> 44:48.908
A nightmare.

44:48.993 --> 44:52.622
It must have been a nightmare.

44:58.873 --> 45:01.512
- We should put him in irons, sir.
- He's a tribune.

45:01.593 --> 45:03.106
I don't care. He's dangerous.

45:03.193 --> 45:07.505
If he asks me once more "Were you
out there?" in that tone of voice...

45:08.913 --> 45:11.302
I haven't slept since we left Joppa.

45:23.833 --> 45:25.824
My lady.

45:25.913 --> 45:28.108
My lady, he is here.

45:50.193 --> 45:52.787
What's wrong, Marcellus? You're ill.

45:54.873 --> 45:58.070
- What is it? Let me help you.
- No one can help me.

46:00.113 --> 46:02.343
It's enough that I'm with you again.

46:04.393 --> 46:06.384
Let's sit here.

46:13.673 --> 46:17.461
You can have no trouble so great
that I'd be afraid to share it.

46:17.553 --> 46:20.386
Ever since I went away
you've been in my heart.

46:20.473 --> 46:23.146
Your voice in my ears,
your image in my eyes.

46:23.713 --> 46:26.227
Waking and sleeping, you were with me.

46:26.313 --> 46:29.544
And even more, since it happened.

46:30.353 --> 46:33.151
- Since what happened?
- Every evening of the voyage,

46:33.233 --> 46:37.146
a star appeared above the bow,
standing bright and steady in the sky,

46:37.233 --> 46:39.747
as if sent to guide the ship home.

46:40.753 --> 46:42.744
In my illness,

46:42.833 --> 46:45.222
I thought you had sent it as a sign.

46:46.233 --> 46:50.351
It became my one link with sanity.

46:52.953 --> 46:55.342
Sanity? What do you mean?

47:08.673 --> 47:10.948
What is it, Marcellus? Tell me.

47:21.513 --> 47:23.583
- Marcellus?
- Don't come near me.

47:23.673 --> 47:25.868
Keep away.

47:26.793 --> 47:28.909
No, Marcellus. Don't.

47:31.833 --> 47:34.063
My love, my poor love.

47:34.473 --> 47:36.464
Tell me.

47:37.073 --> 47:39.462
Soon enough you'll learn the truth.

47:40.313 --> 47:42.543
I am ill, as you guessed.

47:44.033 --> 47:46.183
But in my mind.

47:46.873 --> 47:49.341
The truth is, I'm mad.

47:57.473 --> 47:59.623
My lady?

48:01.193 --> 48:03.229
- What is it?
- A message from the emperor.

48:03.313 --> 48:05.702
He'll see Tribune Gallio at once.

48:08.753 --> 48:10.744
Yes.

48:15.473 --> 48:20.308
- You can't go now, not till you've rested.
- It's no use. He already knows.

48:20.393 --> 48:24.147
The captain of the galley ran to
report to him as soon as we docked.

48:24.233 --> 48:26.224
I'll go with you.

48:26.313 --> 48:28.508
I can't ask you to.

48:28.993 --> 48:31.268
But I want you to know

48:31.913 --> 48:34.302
you're free from your promise.

48:57.233 --> 49:00.191
Sire, Tribune Gallio is here
as you commanded.

49:00.273 --> 49:02.264
But he was made ill by the voyage.

49:02.353 --> 49:05.504
I beg you to postpone the audience
until he is rested.

49:06.393 --> 49:10.625
- Does he ask for a postponement?
- No, sire, but I do. I implore you.

49:10.713 --> 49:13.705
It would serve no purpose.
I will see him now.

49:14.273 --> 49:16.548
Bring him in.

49:16.633 --> 49:19.784
The lovely lady Diana married to an idiot.

49:20.233 --> 49:23.305
But she's too good for Caligula, isn't she?

49:27.193 --> 49:29.423
After 40 years with Julia,

49:29.513 --> 49:32.471
my approaching death
holds few terrors for me.

49:32.553 --> 49:36.831
Death, sire? But my last examination
proves you'll live for 20 years at least.

49:36.913 --> 49:40.349
- My physician is very loyal.
- Not 20, sire.

49:40.433 --> 49:43.664
30. I read it only last night
in the entrails of an owl.

49:43.753 --> 49:46.267
And my soothsayer even more loyal.

49:46.353 --> 49:48.628
The entrails of an owl.

49:48.713 --> 49:51.705
No, stay. We may have need
of you men of science.

49:52.313 --> 49:54.622
The entrails of an owl.

50:02.353 --> 50:05.425
- You are welcome, Tribune.
- Thank you, sire.

50:05.913 --> 50:08.711
I bring you dispatches from Pontius Pilate.

50:08.793 --> 50:12.706
By your leave, sire, he asked me
to put them into your hands and no others.

50:12.793 --> 50:14.943
Then they must hold bad news.

50:15.033 --> 50:17.627
- Sit down, Tribune.
- Thank you, sire.

50:19.033 --> 50:22.025
Tell me, what was your impression of Pilate?

50:23.553 --> 50:26.147
- It's not my place to...
- I'm asking you.

50:26.873 --> 50:29.103
Did you find him capable?

50:29.313 --> 50:32.703
Yes, sire. He is considered
a good administrator.

50:32.793 --> 50:36.502
- Stern, as befits a Roman governor?
- I'm sure of that, sire.

50:37.233 --> 50:39.428
Just?

50:40.273 --> 50:42.867
I can't say.

50:42.953 --> 50:46.548
Why not? Surely you can give me
some sort of an answer.

50:48.713 --> 50:52.149
Tell me, Tribune, what happened out there?

50:54.033 --> 50:57.912
- What happened?
- Were you out there?

50:58.233 --> 51:00.428
Marcellus.

51:01.753 --> 51:04.551
I told you, sire, he's ill. Let me take...

51:06.433 --> 51:09.982
Leave him alone. Stand back.

51:15.073 --> 51:18.270
Tribune Gallio, you are a Roman officer.

51:18.473 --> 51:21.465
I command you to get control over yourself.

51:29.473 --> 51:31.668
Yes, sire.

51:32.993 --> 51:36.065
This report of Pilate's,
and your own condition,

51:36.153 --> 51:38.542
hint alike at a serious situation.

51:39.073 --> 51:42.668
- Now speak.
- Please, Marcellus. He wants to help you.

51:46.673 --> 51:48.664
I'm not your enemy, boy.

51:48.753 --> 51:53.304
I fought in Iberia with your grandfather.
Your father was like a son to me.

51:53.713 --> 51:55.908
Now tell me. Everything.

52:15.993 --> 52:18.666
Is Tribune Gallio still there?

52:18.753 --> 52:20.869
He's been talking for two hours, my lady.

52:20.953 --> 52:24.343
- And?
- Hopeless, my lady. Completely hopeless.

52:31.033 --> 52:33.024
The Son of God?

52:34.673 --> 52:37.062
What god?

52:37.153 --> 52:39.542
I don't know, sire.

52:39.633 --> 52:40.952
I don't know.

52:41.033 --> 52:43.263
And you lost your wits
when he looked at you?

52:43.353 --> 52:44.502
No.

52:44.593 --> 52:47.346
It was later, when I put on the robe.

52:50.993 --> 52:55.464
Miracles, disciples, slaves running away...

52:56.313 --> 53:00.352
Roman legionaries
fraternising with the natives...

53:00.433 --> 53:03.630
Well, none of this
concerns us for the moment.

53:03.713 --> 53:07.991
We must make you well.
What have you learned gentlemen to say?

53:08.073 --> 53:10.507
A difficult matter, sire. Under my care...

53:10.593 --> 53:13.426
- He'd never improve.
- Who gave you permission to speak?

53:13.513 --> 53:16.550
The clue to this man's sanity
is not in a vial of medicine.

53:16.633 --> 53:20.228
- Well, where then?
- In the robe that bewitched him.

53:23.033 --> 53:26.025
- Go on.
- Plainly, there was a curse on the robe.

53:26.113 --> 53:29.025
His only chance is to find it and destroy it.

53:30.033 --> 53:32.024
An interesting notion.

53:33.033 --> 53:36.582
He's right, sire. He must be right.
The robe was bewitched.

53:36.673 --> 53:40.461
- Let me find it, sire, destroy it.
- If you do, your mind will be restored.

53:40.553 --> 53:43.670
A lost robe in the hands of a runaway slave?

53:43.753 --> 53:46.347
- What chance would you have?
- He couldn't get away.

53:46.433 --> 53:50.870
He must be still in Palestine, with
the other followers of the dead man.

53:50.953 --> 53:53.592
He had disciples.
It's there in Pilate's message.

53:53.673 --> 53:56.506
Who knows what powers
he left to these disciples?

53:56.593 --> 53:58.982
Magic formulas, potions...

53:59.073 --> 54:01.792
- Beware.
- He is dead, Dodinius.

54:01.873 --> 54:06.867
Evil never dies. It lives -
in the air, in the robe, everywhere.

54:08.353 --> 54:11.868
Tribune Gallio, I give you
an imperial commission.

54:12.473 --> 54:15.624
For yourself, find this robe and destroy it.

54:16.233 --> 54:20.272
For Rome, seek out
the followers of this dead magician.

54:20.353 --> 54:22.150
I want names, Tribune.

54:22.233 --> 54:26.784
Names of all the disciples, of every man
and woman who subscribe to this treason.

54:26.873 --> 54:28.989
Names, Tribune. All of them.

54:29.073 --> 54:32.270
No matter how much it costs
or how long it takes.

54:32.353 --> 54:34.503
You will report directly to me.

54:35.513 --> 54:37.629
I understand, sire.

54:38.233 --> 54:40.952
- I am grateful.
- A galley will be put at your disposal.

54:41.033 --> 54:43.547
You will leave at once, on the first tide.

54:44.153 --> 54:46.348
That is all.

54:47.153 --> 54:49.462
Thank you, sire.

54:52.633 --> 54:54.624
Wait.

55:00.713 --> 55:05.150
For your sake, I interfered when
my wife wanted to give you to Caligula.

55:05.553 --> 55:09.341
For your sake, I brought your tribune
back from Palestine.

55:09.873 --> 55:12.592
For your sake, I now free you from him.

55:14.433 --> 55:17.948
But, sire, I have no wish to be free.

55:18.033 --> 55:19.944
Have you gone mad too?

55:21.513 --> 55:23.788
He had everything then.

55:23.873 --> 55:26.148
He could have had me too.

55:26.233 --> 55:28.952
I wanted him,
but I wasn't sure that I loved him.

55:29.353 --> 55:31.548
Now I am sure.

55:33.273 --> 55:36.265
I think it my duty
to forbid you to see him again.

55:36.353 --> 55:38.503
As a child, you were wise.

55:38.593 --> 55:41.266
Now you reason like a woman, foolishly.

55:43.673 --> 55:47.951
I can't help being a woman, sire,
but I try to reason as you taught me.

55:48.353 --> 55:50.264
You were a soldier, sire.

55:50.353 --> 55:53.345
When you won, you could expect
your legions to cheer you.

55:53.433 --> 55:55.993
But when you lost,
what would you have given

55:56.073 --> 56:01.227
to see the eagles raised in your honour,
to hear your name on every man's lips?

56:01.313 --> 56:04.271
I like Caligula no better than you do,

56:04.353 --> 56:07.504
but what a wife
you would make for an emperor.

56:08.713 --> 56:12.501
Very well, my dear.
Your tribune shall have another chance.

56:13.233 --> 56:15.428
Thank you, sire.

56:29.233 --> 56:31.349
When it comes,

56:31.753 --> 56:34.028
this is how it will start.

56:34.633 --> 56:37.943
Some obscure martyr
in some forgotten province.

56:38.753 --> 56:42.348
Then madness, infecting the legions,

56:43.153 --> 56:45.269
rotting the empire,

56:45.353 --> 56:47.548
then the finish of Rome.

56:47.633 --> 56:49.863
But if the tribune breaks the spell...

56:49.953 --> 56:52.103
Spell, you fool? What spell?

56:52.193 --> 56:56.709
This is more dangerous than any spell
your superstitious mind could dream of.

56:56.793 --> 56:59.182
It is man's desire to be free.

56:59.993 --> 57:02.461
It is the greatest madness of them all.

57:03.273 --> 57:07.744
And I have sent the most effective
physician I could find to cure it.

57:07.833 --> 57:10.222
I have sent a madman.

57:26.636 --> 57:28.786
Tribune. Tribune.

57:29.636 --> 57:33.993
- I warned you not to call me Tribune.
- Worthy merchant, then. I have news for you.

57:34.076 --> 57:37.068
When Abidor says
he'll find someone, he finds him.

57:37.156 --> 57:39.511
You found the Greek slave. Where is he?

57:39.596 --> 57:43.066
I haven't seen him, not myself.
But he is known, in this village.

57:43.156 --> 57:47.547
- Cana, it's called. You'll find him soon.
- "Soon. " With you it's always "soon".

57:47.636 --> 57:50.787
We've been to three provinces and
a hundred villages. Has he been seen?

57:50.876 --> 57:52.912
These villagers are suspicious.

57:52.996 --> 57:56.750
In this land of Galilee, the crucified one
has many friends, very many.

57:56.836 --> 57:59.350
Names for your list, Tribune -
merchant, I mean.

57:59.436 --> 58:01.904
And coins for me too, no?
A coin for every name.

58:01.996 --> 58:04.669
- The Greek. What about the Greek?
- He has been here.

58:04.756 --> 58:09.386
He is somewhere in Galilee now,
with one they call the big fisherman.

58:09.476 --> 58:12.354
- Fisherman?
- That's all I know. You'll find out the rest.

58:12.436 --> 58:15.394
The emperor's spy is cleverer
than a poor Syrian guide.

58:15.476 --> 58:19.549
I'll prepare the way for you. A Roman
merchant comes to trade for their homespun.

58:19.636 --> 58:21.627
Your gold will buy their answers.

58:21.716 --> 58:23.911
And their lives.

58:35.756 --> 58:38.031
Got any woollens? He'll buy them.

58:38.116 --> 58:40.710
He wants all the homespun in Galilee.

58:40.796 --> 58:43.469
- Who is he?
- The Roman merchant.

58:43.556 --> 58:45.592
He's paying well over market prices.

58:45.676 --> 58:50.830
Says homespun is coming into style in
Rome. The fine ladies dye it fancy colours.

58:50.916 --> 58:53.111
Maybe he'll buy this.

58:55.596 --> 58:58.235
Look what he paid me,
and there was a moth hole in it.

58:58.316 --> 59:02.104
I wouldn't have used that rag of mine
for a donkey blanket.

59:13.196 --> 59:15.187
Look.

59:21.156 --> 59:23.306
Wait.

59:23.396 --> 59:25.956
You've paid more than you should have.

59:26.556 --> 59:28.547
Is this how we were taught?

59:28.636 --> 59:31.469
Do we pray to be washed of the sin of greed

59:31.956 --> 59:36.154
only to close the book,
and cheat the stranger in our midst?

59:36.236 --> 59:40.707
Well, I'm not ashamed, Justus. This money
comes from the taxes that grind us down.

59:40.796 --> 59:43.356
Does one crime erase another?

59:43.436 --> 59:47.270
Friends, shall we turn dishonest
because life is hard?

59:52.036 --> 59:54.152
I think you gave me too much.

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:25.027
Thank you, friend.

01:00:25.116 --> 01:00:27.425
I hope you'll forgive my neighbours.

01:00:27.516 --> 01:00:31.350
I wasn't angry. A man is not cheated
when he's satisfied with the price.

01:00:31.436 --> 01:00:35.349
But you weren't the real loser.
They were only cheating themselves.

01:00:35.436 --> 01:00:37.427
Good day.

01:00:38.956 --> 01:00:40.947
Wait.

01:00:42.956 --> 01:00:46.551
I'd like to camp overnight here.
Can you suggest a place?

01:00:46.636 --> 01:00:48.831
I'd be glad to.

01:00:50.556 --> 01:00:53.275
You seem to have great influence here.

01:00:53.356 --> 01:00:56.632
Well, when age speaks,
youth listens, sometimes.

01:00:56.716 --> 01:00:58.707
That's not what I mean.

01:00:58.796 --> 01:01:01.788
- Are you their leader?
- I'm only a weaver.

01:01:03.036 --> 01:01:07.154
Few travellers come to Cana.
What's the news from the great world?

01:01:08.796 --> 01:01:13.074
The world's the same. But I've heard
that some new ideas have sprung up.

01:01:13.156 --> 01:01:15.147
Ideas are...

01:01:15.996 --> 01:01:19.306
Ideas are important. They grow like children.

01:01:20.236 --> 01:01:23.626
- Have you any children?
- Several. And a grandchild.

01:01:24.276 --> 01:01:28.986
We call him Jonathan, because he was born
with a crooked foot, like Jonathan of old.

01:01:29.076 --> 01:01:30.555
Jonathan of old?

01:01:30.636 --> 01:01:33.594
I don't suppose they teach
our history in Roman schools.

01:01:33.676 --> 01:01:35.667
- Jonathan.
- Yes?

01:01:36.716 --> 01:01:38.308
Wait for me.

01:01:38.396 --> 01:01:41.433
- Didn't you tell me he was crippled?
- He's well now.

01:01:41.516 --> 01:01:43.791
Jonathan, this is...

01:01:44.716 --> 01:01:47.594
Caius Marcellus. How are you, Jonathan?

01:01:47.676 --> 01:01:50.952
- I'm fine, thank you. Are these your donkeys?
- Yes.

01:01:51.036 --> 01:01:54.312
Behind this house there's
a good place to camp, and a well.

01:01:54.396 --> 01:01:56.910
Jonathan, come along.
It's time for you to eat.

01:01:56.996 --> 01:02:00.272
- Already? It's early.
- Perhaps he would like a ride on a donkey.

01:02:00.356 --> 01:02:02.665
- May I?
- Of course.

01:02:02.756 --> 01:02:06.112
What's more, you can keep him.
From now on he's Jonathan's donkey.

01:02:06.196 --> 01:02:08.835
- Mine?
- You are very generous, sir.

01:02:08.916 --> 01:02:11.225
No. I'm still in your debt.

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:14.067
Is he one of us, Grandfather?

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:18.747
You are, or you wouldn't be giving things
away. Did Jesus tell you to do that?

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:21.714
You must have known him.
He straightened my foot.

01:02:21.796 --> 01:02:23.787
- There you are.
- Go. Go.

01:02:23.876 --> 01:02:26.674
Fast, go. Grandfather, look, I'm riding.

01:02:26.756 --> 01:02:30.066
I'm riding my own donkey.
Look, everybody. He's mine.

01:02:30.156 --> 01:02:32.465
David, look. He's my donkey. Mine.

01:02:32.876 --> 01:02:36.186
Look, everybody. The man
down there gave him to me.

01:02:43.076 --> 01:02:46.113
Jesus used to live near here,
you know. In Nazareth.

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:48.551
Almost everyone in Cana knew him.

01:03:43.356 --> 01:03:48.225
Now upon the first day of the week

01:03:48.996 --> 01:03:53.114
Very early in the morning

01:03:53.556 --> 01:03:57.947
We came unto the sepulchre

01:03:58.516 --> 01:04:04.113
And found the stone rolled away, rolled away

01:04:05.316 --> 01:04:09.355
The great stone

01:04:09.756 --> 01:04:13.192
Was rolled away

01:04:13.876 --> 01:04:19.030
And we entered into the sepulchre

01:04:19.516 --> 01:04:26.866
And found not the body of Jesus

01:04:29.316 --> 01:04:36.950
And lo, a voice spake to us, saying:

01:04:37.676 --> 01:04:45.264
"Why seek ye the living
among the dead, among the dead?"

01:04:45.876 --> 01:04:53.988
"O seek not the living among the dead. "

01:04:54.636 --> 01:04:59.630
"For he said unto you in Galilee

01:04:59.956 --> 01:05:04.029
The Son of Man must be delivered

01:05:04.116 --> 01:05:09.986
Into the hands of sinful men

01:05:11.516 --> 01:05:20.311
And be crucified and rise again, rise again. "

01:05:20.556 --> 01:05:26.950
"The Son of Man must rise again. "

01:05:28.036 --> 01:05:33.747
And lo, Jesus appeared to us

01:05:34.116 --> 01:05:38.712
And showed us his wounds

01:05:39.116 --> 01:05:45.510
And he said unto us there:

01:05:46.076 --> 01:05:52.515
"Go ye therefore, the blessed

01:05:52.756 --> 01:05:58.069
And teach all the nations. "

01:05:58.716 --> 01:06:04.188
"And I am with you always. "

01:06:04.516 --> 01:06:08.828
"I am with you. "

01:06:09.316 --> 01:06:15.232
"I am with you

01:06:15.836 --> 01:06:29.352
Even to the end of the world. "

01:06:53.436 --> 01:06:56.109
- Who is she?
- Her name is Miriam.

01:06:56.716 --> 01:07:00.755
You've seen my grandson.
Miriam is another on whom Jesus looked.

01:07:01.436 --> 01:07:03.825
Another miracle?

01:07:03.916 --> 01:07:06.111
If you want to use the word.

01:07:06.196 --> 01:07:09.427
When she was 15,
she was struck down by paralysis.

01:07:09.516 --> 01:07:13.634
It left her hopelessly crippled,
and hopelessly bitter about life.

01:07:13.716 --> 01:07:19.268
She ate herself away with hate and consumed
everyone with her envy and malice.

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:30.466
- But she's still a cripple. She can't walk.
- No, she can't.

01:07:30.556 --> 01:07:32.990
If he was such a magician,
why didn't he cure her?

01:07:33.076 --> 01:07:35.067
He did.

01:07:35.156 --> 01:07:37.351
I don't understand.

01:07:37.916 --> 01:07:40.066
- Have you had supper?
- No.

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:42.750
Perhaps you will honour my poor house.

01:07:44.396 --> 01:07:46.387
Thank you.

01:07:51.156 --> 01:07:53.989
Then one day there was
a wedding here in Cana.

01:07:54.556 --> 01:07:57.673
The whole village took
part in it, all but Miriam.

01:07:58.276 --> 01:08:00.471
She stayed home and wept.

01:08:00.556 --> 01:08:04.947
A wedding, you see, when no man
would look at her and her twisted body.

01:08:05.436 --> 01:08:09.554
But when her parents returned to the house,
they found her, as she is now,

01:08:09.636 --> 01:08:12.230
as you saw her, smiling and singing.

01:08:13.036 --> 01:08:15.266
Was Jesus at the wedding?

01:08:15.356 --> 01:08:18.348
Yes. But he came late.

01:08:19.756 --> 01:08:22.554
So now she spends her time
singing fables about the man.

01:08:22.636 --> 01:08:24.786
But they're not fables.

01:08:24.876 --> 01:08:28.185
Surely you don't believe
that he rose from the dead?

01:08:28.276 --> 01:08:30.470
He lives more surely than we do.

01:08:30.555 --> 01:08:34.947
He's dead. And no moonstruck girl
can sing him back to life again.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:38.312
How do you know that he's dead?

01:08:41.435 --> 01:08:43.631
A soldier told me.

01:08:43.716 --> 01:08:47.504
A soldier who saw
the lance thrust into his side.

01:08:49.475 --> 01:08:51.511
A soldier who was...

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:54.309
who was out there!

01:08:54.395 --> 01:08:56.591
What's wrong?

01:08:57.916 --> 01:09:00.191
Were you out there?

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:03.189
You're ill. Let me help you.

01:09:03.276 --> 01:09:05.743
No. Let me alone.

01:09:07.515 --> 01:09:10.712
Since the voyage, I've been indisposed.

01:09:13.515 --> 01:09:15.711
Forgive me.

01:09:34.555 --> 01:09:38.674
My master. These Romans drink
like pigs, but they pay well.

01:09:51.956 --> 01:09:54.629
- What do you want?
- I have news.

01:09:54.716 --> 01:09:57.276
This pedlar outside is fresh from Jerusalem.

01:09:57.356 --> 01:10:02.305
He says the governor has ordered the arrest
of all these fanatics called Christians.

01:10:02.396 --> 01:10:05.035
And for the leaders
they pay in gold, generously.

01:10:05.116 --> 01:10:07.505
Justus is a leader, no?

01:10:07.596 --> 01:10:11.953
I act under an imperial commission,
and I report to Tiberius, not to Pilate.

01:10:12.036 --> 01:10:15.153
Fine. You are a rich tribune.

01:10:15.236 --> 01:10:18.034
But what harm is it if I get
a few extra coins out of this?

01:10:18.116 --> 01:10:21.711
Justus on the cross is worth
a year of good wine to me.

01:10:29.196 --> 01:10:31.391
- Get back to Damascus, Abidor.
- But...

01:10:31.476 --> 01:10:33.467
Leave now. Tonight.

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:39.190
You won't get rid of me
so easily, worthy merchant.

01:10:39.276 --> 01:10:42.712
These Galileans are poor, but
they might pay well to know who you are.

01:10:42.796 --> 01:10:47.631
And you are the man who crucified him.
You are his murderer, they are saying.

01:10:47.716 --> 01:10:50.025
Stop! You are hurting me!

01:11:03.516 --> 01:11:05.711
Let's go. Come on.

01:11:06.196 --> 01:11:08.073
Kick him. Kick him.

01:11:08.156 --> 01:11:11.114
- Kick him harder. Let's go.
- I'm kicking.

01:11:11.196 --> 01:11:13.391
Go on, kick him. He'll go.

01:11:13.476 --> 01:11:16.627
Kick him, that's it. He'll go. Kick him.

01:11:16.716 --> 01:11:18.832
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

01:11:18.916 --> 01:11:20.907
- Kick him.
- Jonathan, isn't it?

01:11:20.996 --> 01:11:23.191
- Yes.
- Letting your friend have a ride?

01:11:23.276 --> 01:11:26.393
- No, I gave him the donkey.
- You gave him the donkey?

01:11:26.476 --> 01:11:31.266
- Did your grandfather tell you to do that?
- No, sir. I did it myself.

01:11:34.196 --> 01:11:36.585
Why are you so angry?

01:11:37.556 --> 01:11:39.547
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:11:40.556 --> 01:11:42.945
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

01:11:43.036 --> 01:11:45.755
I sit here so that I can watch people pass.

01:11:45.836 --> 01:11:49.067
Well, wouldn't you be angry?
I gave him the donkey for himself.

01:11:49.156 --> 01:11:51.954
Then it doesn't matter what he does with it.

01:11:53.556 --> 01:11:55.069
I suppose not.

01:11:55.156 --> 01:11:57.511
Is it that you resent
what our master taught us?

01:11:57.596 --> 01:12:00.554
Why should I resent it?
He means nothing to me.

01:12:00.836 --> 01:12:03.430
Then why do you consider him your enemy?

01:12:05.516 --> 01:12:08.394
You see, we know
why you're here, Marcellus.

01:12:08.996 --> 01:12:14.354
It's simple, really. No merchant, even
a stupid one, would have paid those prices.

01:12:14.756 --> 01:12:17.429
And the look of you, those shoulders.

01:12:17.836 --> 01:12:20.225
We guessed at once what you were.

01:12:21.956 --> 01:12:25.187
Sit down, please, here in
the shade. The sun's hot.

01:12:29.796 --> 01:12:32.708
Why must you do this, Marcellus?
Is it for Rome?

01:12:35.796 --> 01:12:37.946
Yes.

01:12:38.036 --> 01:12:41.312
And for myself, to save my reason.

01:12:43.156 --> 01:12:45.624
Justus said you were ill.

01:12:45.716 --> 01:12:47.308
- There's one who can help.
- No.

01:12:47.396 --> 01:12:51.025
- He was crucified. That was the end of him.
- That was the beginning.

01:12:51.116 --> 01:12:54.825
He's with his Father, but he left his word
with us and taught us how to use it.

01:12:54.916 --> 01:12:57.555
Don't confess to sorcery.
You'll make things worse.

01:12:57.636 --> 01:13:01.231
He was no sorcerer, Marcellus.
He cast no spells.

01:13:01.316 --> 01:13:06.549
He only asked two things of us: "Love God",
he said, "and love ye one another. "

01:13:07.356 --> 01:13:12.350
And he meant not only the Jews, but
Romans and Greeks, slaves and soldiers,

01:13:12.756 --> 01:13:15.270
the strong and the weak, everyone.

01:13:15.756 --> 01:13:19.544
He asked us to build our lives
on this love, this charity.

01:13:20.076 --> 01:13:24.547
- To build a new world.
- Worlds are built on force, not charity.

01:13:24.636 --> 01:13:26.627
Power is all that counts.

01:13:26.716 --> 01:13:30.595
Perhaps we have something
better than power. We have hope.

01:13:32.596 --> 01:13:34.985
That you of all people should say that.

01:13:35.596 --> 01:13:37.632
What do you mean, Marcellus?

01:13:37.716 --> 01:13:41.550
You say he could work miracles,
but he left you as he found you.

01:13:41.636 --> 01:13:44.150
I used to wonder at that myself,

01:13:44.236 --> 01:13:46.670
until faith taught me the answer.

01:13:47.276 --> 01:13:52.430
He could have healed my body, and it would
have been natural for me to laugh and sing.

01:13:52.516 --> 01:13:57.226
And then I came to understand that
he had done something even better for me.

01:13:57.836 --> 01:14:00.111
He'd chosen me for his work.

01:14:00.196 --> 01:14:03.825
He'd left me as I am so that all others like me

01:14:04.556 --> 01:14:10.153
might know that misfortune needn't deprive
them of happiness within his kingdom.

01:14:11.396 --> 01:14:14.354
It's beyond reason that
anybody should think as you do.

01:14:14.436 --> 01:14:18.873
If you had only known him,
looked into his eyes, heard him speak...

01:14:19.156 --> 01:14:21.431
- I did.
- I don't understand.

01:14:21.516 --> 01:14:24.076
Please. It's enough.

01:14:26.356 --> 01:14:28.711
You're in no danger from me.

01:14:29.116 --> 01:14:31.346
I'm leaving. Now.

01:14:31.436 --> 01:14:33.631
- We hoped you'd stay.
- Do you want to die?

01:14:33.716 --> 01:14:35.911
- Of course not.
- Then let me go.

01:14:36.756 --> 01:14:39.065
No one's holding you, Marcellus.

01:14:42.396 --> 01:14:47.186
But a man came here this morning
I wanted you to meet, the big fisherman.

01:14:49.236 --> 01:14:51.704
- Fisherman?
- Simon the Galilean.

01:14:52.316 --> 01:14:54.671
The one Jesus called Peter.

01:14:56.836 --> 01:14:58.747
Did he come alone?

01:14:58.836 --> 01:15:02.112
No, he has a companion, a Greek.

01:15:02.196 --> 01:15:04.107
Where are they?

01:15:04.196 --> 01:15:07.347
At Shalum's inn. It's not far from here.

01:15:10.196 --> 01:15:12.391
Marcellus?

01:15:13.276 --> 01:15:17.428
I don't know what's in your heart.
I've tried to tell you what's in mine.

01:15:17.516 --> 01:15:20.906
But it's clear that you're troubled,
and I wish I could help you.

01:15:20.996 --> 01:15:24.466
Every man must find his own way,
but sometimes it's a comfort

01:15:24.556 --> 01:15:28.265
to know that others, too,
have felt confused and lost.

01:15:28.676 --> 01:15:31.065
Don't lose heart, Marcellus.

01:15:31.156 --> 01:15:35.035
The way is never easy,
but it's a path good men must take.

01:15:36.116 --> 01:15:38.425
I hope you'll find yours.

01:15:55.716 --> 01:15:58.105
The Greek, Demetrius. Where is he?

01:15:58.596 --> 01:16:00.985
Up the stairs. The first door you see.

01:16:11.916 --> 01:16:14.510
Stand up in the presence of your master.

01:16:19.116 --> 01:16:21.584
That robe. Where is it?

01:16:23.676 --> 01:16:25.871
The robe?

01:16:30.156 --> 01:16:32.147
- Here.
- Keep away.

01:16:32.956 --> 01:16:34.947
Sir, you look ill.

01:16:35.036 --> 01:16:37.231
There. Burn it.

01:16:37.636 --> 01:16:39.831
- Why?
- It cast a spell on me.

01:16:39.916 --> 01:16:42.635
- It couldn't.
- I order you to burn it. Now.

01:16:42.716 --> 01:16:46.755
Why are you afraid of it? I'm not.
It brings me close to the one who wore it.

01:16:46.836 --> 01:16:49.145
I've ordered you to burn it.

01:16:49.796 --> 01:16:52.151
That you will have to do yourself.

01:16:54.196 --> 01:16:57.552
I'll have you whipped
and sold as a galley slave.

01:16:57.636 --> 01:16:59.706
I'll teach you who's master here.

01:16:59.796 --> 01:17:01.991
I know who my master is.

01:17:04.796 --> 01:17:08.425
You're afraid, but you don't
really know the reason why.

01:17:09.436 --> 01:17:12.189
You think it's his robe that made you ill.

01:17:12.276 --> 01:17:15.552
But it's your own conscience,
your own decent shame.

01:17:15.636 --> 01:17:18.275
Even when you crucified him you felt it.

01:17:18.356 --> 01:17:21.189
The spell isn't in here,
it's in your heart and your mind.

01:17:21.276 --> 01:17:24.905
Face it, Marcellus. Don't be afraid of him.

01:17:24.996 --> 01:17:27.305
He'd understand you.

01:17:27.396 --> 01:17:29.785
He had compassion for all men.

01:17:30.556 --> 01:17:32.353
Marcellus.

01:17:32.436 --> 01:17:34.666
It was for your sake that he died.

01:17:34.756 --> 01:17:36.747
For the sake of all of us.

01:17:36.836 --> 01:17:39.031
No. No. No.

01:18:03.556 --> 01:18:05.865
I am not afraid.

01:18:09.316 --> 01:18:11.511
I'm not afraid.

01:18:17.956 --> 01:18:21.949
Until now, you only remembered
what you did to a man.

01:18:23.716 --> 01:18:26.025
The wrong, and your shame.

01:18:26.636 --> 01:18:30.345
But now you remember the man.

01:19:08.756 --> 01:19:10.951
Come, let me present you.

01:19:13.596 --> 01:19:15.826
Marcellus Gallio, tribune of Rome.

01:19:16.436 --> 01:19:18.427
Peter, fisherman of Galilee.

01:19:18.516 --> 01:19:21.235
A humble subject of the empire
is honoured, Tribune.

01:19:21.316 --> 01:19:23.705
I think the honour is mine, sir.

01:19:24.356 --> 01:19:27.075
Everybody, move closer.

01:19:28.116 --> 01:19:31.950
Sit down, children. Closer, everybody.

01:19:32.676 --> 01:19:35.907
Sit down. I want to talk to you.

01:19:37.196 --> 01:19:42.907
Neighbours and friends, many of us
were privileged to know our master.

01:19:43.476 --> 01:19:47.867
But none was as close to him
as our friend Simon of Galilee,

01:19:48.476 --> 01:19:52.389
whom he loved as his own brother,
and whom he called Peter.

01:19:53.556 --> 01:19:59.188
On that terrible night when he was betrayed,
when some doubted and all fled his side,

01:19:59.276 --> 01:20:03.986
only Peter remained steadfast,
loyal to the end.

01:20:04.076 --> 01:20:07.148
You may speak in a moment, Peter.
Now it's my turn.

01:20:07.236 --> 01:20:11.070
And so, my neighbours, on this happy day,

01:20:11.156 --> 01:20:13.954
I welcome you here to honour...

01:20:25.956 --> 01:20:28.345
Stop it. Stop it!

01:20:32.396 --> 01:20:34.705
Stop it. Stay where you are.

01:20:35.436 --> 01:20:37.631
Advance. Advance.

01:20:38.316 --> 01:20:40.307
Halt.

01:20:42.116 --> 01:20:45.153
Well, Tribune. Your new command?

01:20:48.236 --> 01:20:51.387
Centurion, by what authority
do you attack these people?

01:20:51.476 --> 01:20:53.990
I need no authority
to clean out a nest of traitors.

01:20:54.076 --> 01:20:57.466
- Withdraw your men.
- And your authority, Tribune?

01:20:58.716 --> 01:21:01.389
- An imperial commission.
- I know you have it.

01:21:01.476 --> 01:21:04.309
But it's no longer in effect.
Tiberius is dead.

01:21:05.196 --> 01:21:08.393
Caligula is emperor.
Hits you hard, doesn't it?

01:21:09.236 --> 01:21:11.227
- Men.
- Wait.

01:21:12.436 --> 01:21:17.829
An imperial commission is good until it is
revoked by the emperor, whoever he may be.

01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:20.305
- Have you new orders from Caligula?
- No, but...

01:21:20.396 --> 01:21:22.591
Then obey mine.

01:21:30.676 --> 01:21:32.871
Make me obey, Tribune.

01:21:34.156 --> 01:21:37.193
No. You won't try, will you?

01:21:37.356 --> 01:21:39.916
Brave enough with a dice, or a cup of wine.

01:21:39.996 --> 01:21:44.194
A tribune because you bear an important
name, because you have friends at court.

01:21:44.276 --> 01:21:48.349
Well, you outrank me, but
I earned my rank, every step of it,

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:52.634
in Gaul and Iberia and Africa,
against the enemies of Rome.

01:21:54.196 --> 01:21:56.391
With this.

01:21:58.116 --> 01:22:00.232
Make me obey you, Tribune,

01:22:00.516 --> 01:22:02.871
if you're fool enough to try.

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:09.948
You are a fool.

01:22:10.036 --> 01:22:14.154
I've split more men from head to foot
than you see in this square.

01:22:14.236 --> 01:22:17.831
If I win, you'll keep your word?
You'll withdraw your men?

01:22:17.916 --> 01:22:20.635
If you win, they'll be yours to command.

01:22:21.196 --> 01:22:23.391
I'll be dead.

01:24:05.796 --> 01:24:08.708
Well? What are you waiting for?

01:24:09.716 --> 01:24:11.911
Finish it.

01:24:25.716 --> 01:24:28.549
You may give that order now, Centurion.

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:04.356
Column! Form square!

01:25:17.516 --> 01:25:19.507
Prepare to march.

01:25:19.596 --> 01:25:21.791
Formation, turn.

01:25:22.556 --> 01:25:24.706
Column forward.

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:30.107
Marcellus?

01:26:39.756 --> 01:26:41.986
Demetrius and I will leave in the morning.

01:26:42.076 --> 01:26:46.866
We go to Syria, Lebanon, then Greece,
Sicily, and finally Rome itself.

01:26:47.756 --> 01:26:49.747
Everywhere we'll find friends.

01:26:49.836 --> 01:26:51.827
Everywhere our movement grows.

01:26:52.516 --> 01:26:54.666
And you, Marcellus?

01:26:54.756 --> 01:26:57.065
I suppose I'll go back to Rome.

01:26:57.156 --> 01:27:00.307
Demetrius and I
wondered if you'd come with us.

01:27:00.396 --> 01:27:03.991
- You want me?
- We can always use courage and devotion.

01:27:05.236 --> 01:27:07.272
No. No.

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:11.592
- It's impossible. I can never be one of you.
- Why not?

01:27:12.476 --> 01:27:15.786
Marcellus, is there
something you want to tell me?

01:27:17.676 --> 01:27:19.667
Yes.

01:27:21.116 --> 01:27:23.107
Yes.

01:27:26.436 --> 01:27:28.950
- I'll try.
- If it will make it easier,

01:27:29.036 --> 01:27:31.755
let me tell you about the burden I carry.

01:27:32.356 --> 01:27:35.553
You heard Justus say
I was steadfast and loyal.

01:27:36.276 --> 01:27:38.471
He didn't know.

01:27:38.556 --> 01:27:41.309
The night Jesus needed
me most, I denied him.

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:47.592
Not once, but three times.
I swore I never knew him.

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:50.466
Now.

01:27:52.476 --> 01:27:56.105
I crucified him.

01:27:57.556 --> 01:28:00.548
I know. Demetrius told me.

01:28:04.316 --> 01:28:06.466
And you can forgive me?

01:28:07.076 --> 01:28:09.271
He forgave you from the cross.

01:28:09.876 --> 01:28:12.026
Can I do less?

01:28:14.156 --> 01:28:16.954
Now, does anything stand in your way?

01:28:17.836 --> 01:28:20.031
Can you be one of us?

01:28:22.756 --> 01:28:24.826
From this day on,

01:28:24.916 --> 01:28:27.305
I'm enlisted in his service.

01:28:27.716 --> 01:28:31.231
I offer him my sword, my fortune and my life.

01:28:32.396 --> 01:28:35.194
And this I pledge you
on my honour as a Roman.

01:29:11.956 --> 01:29:14.550
- Will you wait for me here, please?
- Yes, my lady.

01:29:24.956 --> 01:29:27.265
The emperor will see you now.

01:29:54.436 --> 01:29:57.234
The lady Diana, as beautiful as ever.

01:29:58.236 --> 01:30:01.751
- And as cold.
- You commanded my presence here, sire.

01:30:01.836 --> 01:30:06.387
- Only because my invitations were ignored.
- I sent word that I was ill.

01:30:06.476 --> 01:30:11.755
And you have chosen to be a guest of
Senator Gallio, who bears me no great love.

01:30:12.956 --> 01:30:16.266
Shouldn't I consider
such behaviour an affront?

01:30:17.356 --> 01:30:19.347
You are the emperor, sire.

01:30:19.436 --> 01:30:21.870
It is not in my power to affront you.

01:30:21.956 --> 01:30:24.186
Good. Good.

01:30:25.596 --> 01:30:30.067
Tell me, what news have the Gallios had
of their precious son Marcellus?

01:30:31.596 --> 01:30:33.791
- None, sire.
- And you.

01:30:34.636 --> 01:30:36.866
He must have written to you.

01:30:38.876 --> 01:30:41.106
Not for almost a year.

01:30:41.196 --> 01:30:44.586
His last letter was from
a village in Palestine called Cana.

01:30:44.676 --> 01:30:46.507
And nothing since then?

01:30:46.596 --> 01:30:51.112
Nothing from Antioch,
or Ephesus, or Corinth?

01:30:54.716 --> 01:30:57.184
You are telling the truth, aren't you?

01:30:58.196 --> 01:31:02.314
Poor Diana. He's played
you false, like the rest of us.

01:31:02.396 --> 01:31:05.672
- What do you mean?
- I mean he's here in Rome,

01:31:05.756 --> 01:31:07.747
and has been for some time.

01:31:07.836 --> 01:31:10.430
- That's impossible.
- He fooled me, too.

01:31:10.516 --> 01:31:12.905
I thought he was only a wastrel and a clown.

01:31:12.996 --> 01:31:15.954
He's become one of the most
dangerous men in the empire,

01:31:16.036 --> 01:31:18.504
a traitor and a conspirator against the state.

01:31:18.596 --> 01:31:21.474
- No. Not Marcellus.
- That's why he hasn't come to you,

01:31:21.556 --> 01:31:23.911
or his family, or his friends.

01:31:23.996 --> 01:31:28.433
You've heard of this new sect, these fanatics
who call themselves Christians?

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:31.588
- He's one of them, one of the ringleaders.
- It can't be true.

01:31:31.676 --> 01:31:34.668
No? Then come. I'll show you.

01:31:37.236 --> 01:31:42.105
You'll learn for yourself what kind of man
it is you preferred to your emperor.

01:31:44.316 --> 01:31:46.511
Where is he?

01:31:55.596 --> 01:31:58.349
Marcellus's personal slave, remember?

01:31:59.556 --> 01:32:01.865
The day he dared to bid against me.

01:32:02.556 --> 01:32:04.547
But now no longer a slave.

01:32:04.636 --> 01:32:06.911
His partner in treason.

01:32:07.676 --> 01:32:09.985
- Has he talked?
- No, sire.

01:32:10.316 --> 01:32:13.706
- Ask him again.
- Where is Tribune Gallio?

01:32:15.476 --> 01:32:17.467
Where's he hiding?

01:32:17.556 --> 01:32:19.547
Give him the wheel.

01:32:25.116 --> 01:32:27.266
Three of them came here from Corinth.

01:32:27.356 --> 01:32:31.554
The Greek slave, a Jewish
fisherman, our loyal tribune.

01:32:31.636 --> 01:32:34.469
We've caught one. Soon we'll have the others.

01:32:34.556 --> 01:32:36.433
Where is he?

01:32:36.636 --> 01:32:38.831
Give it to him.

01:32:40.236 --> 01:32:43.114
Enough for now. He's no good to us dead.

01:32:43.516 --> 01:32:45.791
Let him think about it for a while.

01:32:58.836 --> 01:33:01.031
My lady. What's wrong?

01:33:02.956 --> 01:33:04.912
It's Marcellus.

01:33:04.996 --> 01:33:07.032
They say he's alive.

01:33:07.116 --> 01:33:09.311
He's here in Rome.

01:33:10.196 --> 01:33:12.505
- Who told you that?
- The emperor.

01:33:14.516 --> 01:33:17.314
They have his slave in there.
They're torturing him.

01:33:17.396 --> 01:33:20.308
- Demetrius is here in the palace?
- I saw him.

01:33:21.076 --> 01:33:23.271
You're sure?

01:33:27.036 --> 01:33:29.027
What is it, Marcipor?

01:33:29.116 --> 01:33:31.311
What do you know about it?

01:33:34.596 --> 01:33:36.791
You've seen Marcellus.

01:33:37.716 --> 01:33:40.594
You're one of them. A Christian.

01:33:41.116 --> 01:33:43.107
Yes, my lady.

01:33:44.476 --> 01:33:46.467
Take me to him.

01:33:47.676 --> 01:33:50.190
- I can't.
- Do you think I'd betray him?

01:33:50.276 --> 01:33:52.471
Take me to him.

01:33:54.636 --> 01:33:56.433
Come.

01:35:09.556 --> 01:35:11.751
Wait here.

01:35:35.876 --> 01:35:39.755
- Where have they got Demetrius?
- In the armoury, below the guardroom.

01:35:41.476 --> 01:35:43.671
I know the place.

01:35:45.676 --> 01:35:48.190
- Where's Peter?
- At the meeting in Bovillae.

01:35:48.276 --> 01:35:52.349
- He won't be back until midnight.
- Right. We can't wait for him.

01:35:54.076 --> 01:35:57.546
Get me ten volunteers to come
with me as soon as it's dark.

01:35:57.636 --> 01:35:59.308
I'll go, Marcipor.

01:36:09.156 --> 01:36:12.353
Why didn't you come?
Why have you kept away from me?

01:36:13.156 --> 01:36:15.511
I would have come, soon.

01:36:15.596 --> 01:36:17.985
But Caligula's decreed against us.

01:36:18.516 --> 01:36:21.110
- He said...
- I can imagine what he said.

01:36:22.996 --> 01:36:25.556
Whatever you are, you're not a traitor.

01:36:26.556 --> 01:36:28.865
- If you're still ill...
- No.

01:36:28.956 --> 01:36:32.744
I'm well. Really well,
for the first time in my life.

01:36:36.516 --> 01:36:38.586
You found the robe?

01:36:38.676 --> 01:36:40.667
Yes.

01:36:43.636 --> 01:36:45.831
Here it is.

01:36:48.236 --> 01:36:50.227
Here.

01:36:51.236 --> 01:36:53.625
Why, it's just ordinary homespun.

01:36:54.436 --> 01:36:57.155
- Was it really bewitched?
- In a way.

01:36:57.916 --> 01:37:01.352
It changed my life.
In time, it will change the world.

01:37:04.556 --> 01:37:06.751
I don't understand.

01:37:10.036 --> 01:37:12.869
It's a long story. And a strange one.

01:37:13.836 --> 01:37:16.066
- About the robe?
- Yes.

01:37:16.476 --> 01:37:19.354
About the robe, and the one who wore it.

01:37:31.916 --> 01:37:33.907
- It's nearly dark.
- Good.

01:37:33.996 --> 01:37:36.590
Send Marcipor to me when he comes back.

01:37:43.036 --> 01:37:45.072
Why are you dressed like that?

01:37:45.156 --> 01:37:47.351
No, Marcellus. They'll kill you.

01:37:47.756 --> 01:37:51.146
- You must have faith.
- Faith in what? This new god of yours?

01:37:51.236 --> 01:37:55.468
He couldn't save his own Son.
They crucified him and they'll kill you, too.

01:37:55.556 --> 01:37:58.673
- I can't leave Demetrius to be tortured.
- But you'll leave me.

01:37:58.756 --> 01:38:03.147
I love you. Does this dream of yours
mean more to you than our love?

01:38:05.156 --> 01:38:09.752
Marcellus, what you've told me
is a beautiful story, but it isn't true.

01:38:10.356 --> 01:38:14.508
Justice and charity. Men will
never accept such a philosophy.

01:38:14.596 --> 01:38:18.874
The world isn't like that.
It never has been, and it never will be.

01:38:20.476 --> 01:38:23.354
Why must you throw
your life away for a slave?

01:38:24.356 --> 01:38:26.950
I owe him a great deal more than my life.

01:38:33.756 --> 01:38:37.385
If your god means that much to you,
I won't stand in your way.

01:38:39.276 --> 01:38:41.949
I want to be your wife whatever you believe.

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:45.911
I'd marry you if I had to
share you with a thousand gods.

01:38:50.356 --> 01:38:52.347
Ready.

01:38:52.436 --> 01:38:54.631
Oh, my love.

01:39:00.956 --> 01:39:03.151
Take her home.

01:39:04.236 --> 01:39:06.909
Diana, I'll come to you as soon as I can.

01:39:07.916 --> 01:39:10.111
Keep the robe for me.

01:39:36.516 --> 01:39:39.474
- Sentry, come with me.
- What's the watchword, Tribune?

01:39:39.556 --> 01:39:42.753
- Hurry, you fool.
- Guard!

01:39:44.556 --> 01:39:46.751
Who's there?

01:39:52.236 --> 01:39:54.306
Stop. You. Stop.

01:40:19.036 --> 01:40:21.231
Get the boy up.

01:40:48.556 --> 01:40:51.275
On the emperor's business. Open up.

01:40:51.516 --> 01:40:53.313
What business, Tribune?

01:40:53.396 --> 01:40:56.274
If you're in command, my message is for you.

01:40:56.676 --> 01:41:00.191
You're not one of the Praetorian tribunes.
I know them all.

01:41:00.276 --> 01:41:02.471
Now!

01:41:03.676 --> 01:41:05.746
The keys. The keys, quick.

01:41:20.876 --> 01:41:21.991
Quickly now.

01:42:20.756 --> 01:42:25.352
I can't believe you let them take
an imperial prisoner from the palace itself.

01:42:26.116 --> 01:42:29.153
Tribune Quintus, where
were you when this happened?

01:42:29.236 --> 01:42:32.626
- I could send you to the galleys.
- The Greek was nearly dead.

01:42:32.716 --> 01:42:36.425
- By now he's a corpse.
- The Greek? Who cares about the Greek?

01:42:36.516 --> 01:42:39.235
Or the Jew fisherman
or any of the rest of them?

01:42:39.316 --> 01:42:44.674
I want the Roman traitor who's responsible,
who made fools of the Praetorian Guard.

01:42:44.756 --> 01:42:48.635
I want Tribune Gallio. I want him
in my hands before sunrise.

01:42:49.036 --> 01:42:52.585
I want him alive. I want him
to stand before me alive.

01:42:52.676 --> 01:42:55.873
Do you hear me? Find him
or you'll all go to the galleys.

01:42:55.956 --> 01:42:59.187
Tear the city apart if you have to.
But find him!

01:42:59.596 --> 01:43:01.826
Now, get out, all of you.

01:43:01.916 --> 01:43:03.907
Go.

01:43:12.116 --> 01:43:14.107
- Anything?
- No, sir.

01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:17.348
- And you?
- No, sir.

01:43:17.436 --> 01:43:19.427
- Upstairs?
- No, sir.

01:43:20.916 --> 01:43:23.111
Detail, form.

01:43:29.156 --> 01:43:31.226
Senator.

01:43:31.316 --> 01:43:33.511
Detail, march.

01:44:55.316 --> 01:44:58.706
- I can barely feel the heartbeat.
- He can't die.

01:44:59.116 --> 01:45:03.394
- Is he such a valuable slave?
- He's one of the most valuable men alive.

01:45:03.716 --> 01:45:06.947
- Well, he won't be alive for long.
- You're a physician.

01:45:07.036 --> 01:45:09.504
There are limits to what science can achieve.

01:45:09.596 --> 01:45:14.386
I can't put shattered flesh together again,
nor restore the blood he's lost.

01:45:19.716 --> 01:45:23.709
Father in heaven, he was
the bravest and best of thy servants.

01:45:25.316 --> 01:45:27.625
Why hast thou abandoned him?

01:46:00.956 --> 01:46:03.470
Let me be alone with him.

01:46:03.556 --> 01:46:06.070
You stay, Marcellus. And you, Diana.

01:46:06.956 --> 01:46:09.789
Who is this man? Is he a physician?

01:46:09.876 --> 01:46:11.867
No. Please go.

01:46:18.556 --> 01:46:20.945
For my sake, sir. Please.

01:46:34.756 --> 01:46:36.747
Demetrius.

01:46:39.196 --> 01:46:41.187
Demetrius.

01:46:55.396 --> 01:46:59.787
- What's he doing in there? Who is he?
- I've never seen him before.

01:46:59.876 --> 01:47:03.949
Senator Gallio should inform himself
about what goes on in his own household,

01:47:04.036 --> 01:47:06.470
with his own son.

01:47:06.556 --> 01:47:09.946
This is my house, sir.
You were called here as a physician,

01:47:10.036 --> 01:47:14.905
- not to question my family's behaviour.
- I'm a physician, but first of all a Roman.

01:47:14.996 --> 01:47:17.305
And I must tell you bluntly that...

01:48:01.876 --> 01:48:04.948
- He's gone?
- We didn't even thank him.

01:48:06.556 --> 01:48:08.751
What did he do?

01:48:09.916 --> 01:48:12.146
You were here. You saw it.

01:48:13.076 --> 01:48:15.510
- Yes, he...
- Can't you speak?

01:48:15.596 --> 01:48:17.746
Are you bewitched?

01:48:18.556 --> 01:48:20.831
So that's it. Sorcery.

01:48:21.716 --> 01:48:26.506
Doesn't your friend know the penalty
for pretending to heal by such methods?

01:48:27.636 --> 01:48:29.627
Pretending?

01:48:36.196 --> 01:48:40.792
Marius, you did everything
in your power, and we're grateful.

01:48:40.876 --> 01:48:43.436
- Come, stay and eat with us.
- No, thank you.

01:48:43.516 --> 01:48:45.746
There are mysteries to life and death, yes.

01:48:45.836 --> 01:48:48.191
Patients have made astonishing recoveries.

01:48:48.276 --> 01:48:52.508
But I have never ascribed them to the magic
of a sorcerer. Good night to you, Senator.

01:48:52.596 --> 01:48:54.587
Tribune.

01:49:01.596 --> 01:49:03.826
Do you think he'll go to Caligula?

01:49:03.916 --> 01:49:07.306
I think he's a proud man
and his pride's been hurt.

01:49:12.356 --> 01:49:16.554
Well, if your slave's fit to be moved,
you'd better take him back to the catacombs.

01:49:16.636 --> 01:49:21.027
Marcipor? Order a carriage
and two men to help me with Demetrius.

01:49:24.996 --> 01:49:26.634
Sir.

01:49:27.796 --> 01:49:30.833
I'd like to see you again,
to tell you more about our...

01:49:30.916 --> 01:49:33.714
We are seeing each other for the last time.

01:49:34.716 --> 01:49:37.947
You have chosen to make
yourself an enemy of Rome.

01:49:38.356 --> 01:49:40.745
From this night on, I have no son.

01:49:50.956 --> 01:49:53.345
I've brought something for you.

01:50:02.436 --> 01:50:05.155
Tomorrow I'll send for you.

01:50:05.556 --> 01:50:07.547
- All ready, sir.
- Yes.

01:50:11.916 --> 01:50:13.907
Tomorrow.

01:51:02.996 --> 01:51:04.793
We're being followed.

01:51:08.116 --> 01:51:10.311
Faster. Faster.

01:51:58.356 --> 01:52:00.551
- Stop at the bridge.
- Yes, sir.

01:52:12.596 --> 01:52:16.350
- No, don't.
- For all you've been to me, thanks.

01:52:22.076 --> 01:52:24.067
Into the carriage.

01:52:24.156 --> 01:52:26.351
Get him to Peter.

01:52:29.356 --> 01:52:31.950
Goodbye, friend.

01:52:33.596 --> 01:52:35.791
Goodbye, friend.

01:53:05.916 --> 01:53:08.510
I can only give you a few moments.

01:53:09.276 --> 01:53:11.267
Diana.

01:53:18.116 --> 01:53:20.346
I prayed that I'd see you again.

01:53:20.956 --> 01:53:23.629
We haven't much time, Marcellus, so listen.

01:53:23.716 --> 01:53:28.028
Tomorrow you're to be put on trial
before the entire court.

01:53:28.116 --> 01:53:30.789
- I never thought I'd get a trial.
- Your father's powerful.

01:53:30.876 --> 01:53:35.347
Caligula can't just kill you.
He's forced to prove that you're guilty.

01:53:35.436 --> 01:53:37.745
He'll have no trouble proving it.

01:53:40.236 --> 01:53:42.466
It's up to you, Marcellus.

01:53:44.476 --> 01:53:46.706
What do you want me to do?

01:53:47.116 --> 01:53:49.346
Don't defy Caligula.

01:53:50.356 --> 01:53:52.950
Your god doesn't want you to die. He can't.

01:53:53.316 --> 01:53:56.911
Otherwise he wouldn't have
sent Peter to save Demetrius.

01:53:57.676 --> 01:53:59.667
I'm afraid, Diana.

01:54:02.316 --> 01:54:05.228
In Cana I lived with people
who were not afraid.

01:54:05.836 --> 01:54:09.988
People who'd met Jesus face to face,
who'd spoken with him,

01:54:10.996 --> 01:54:13.305
eaten and laughed with him.

01:54:14.316 --> 01:54:18.150
A crippled girl who thought
herself fortunate to be lame.

01:54:18.236 --> 01:54:23.151
A weaver whose words were like his work:
simple, and lasting, and strong.

01:54:24.996 --> 01:54:27.669
A little boy who gave his donkey to a friend.

01:54:28.556 --> 01:54:32.708
Never again in his life would he own
anything as fine as that donkey,

01:54:32.796 --> 01:54:36.869
and yet he gave it happily,
without a second thought.

01:54:38.956 --> 01:54:44.235
If these people had denied him
one after the other, to save their skins,

01:54:46.596 --> 01:54:48.951
would he have any followers left?

01:54:51.796 --> 01:54:54.151
I want to think as you do.

01:54:54.236 --> 01:54:57.706
I want to be like those people,
but I can't do it alone.

01:54:58.516 --> 01:55:00.711
I can't do it without you.

01:55:01.516 --> 01:55:04.952
My faith in what you told me
isn't strong enough.

01:55:05.036 --> 01:55:08.346
If you die, I'll believe
that you died for nothing.

01:55:08.956 --> 01:55:11.550
My lady, you'll have to go now.

01:55:15.316 --> 01:55:17.511
Please, Marcellus.

01:55:17.916 --> 01:55:20.305
I need you.

01:56:36.596 --> 01:56:40.589
Senator, the emperor wishes
to speak to you and the lady Diana.

01:56:54.076 --> 01:56:56.351
Greetings to our loyal senator.

01:56:56.436 --> 01:56:59.109
The proceedings here today will interest you.

01:56:59.196 --> 01:57:02.393
- Sire, I am not in the mood for...
- Patience.

01:57:02.476 --> 01:57:05.673
- If my son is to be put on trial...
- Patience!

01:57:06.596 --> 01:57:08.985
You will sit by me.

01:57:14.476 --> 01:57:17.468
Thank you, sire, but
my place is with the senator.

01:57:17.556 --> 01:57:20.832
Your place is where your emperor decides.

01:57:20.916 --> 01:57:23.225
Isn't that so, Senator?

01:57:38.716 --> 01:57:42.595
- You don't look very happy.
- Have I reason to be?

01:57:42.676 --> 01:57:46.271
There isn't a woman in Rome
who wouldn't pray for this honour.

01:57:46.356 --> 01:57:49.553
There's only one man
at whose side I pray to sit.

01:57:51.116 --> 01:57:55.985
Before this day is out, you will
be praying on your knees to me.

01:57:56.076 --> 01:57:58.271
For his life.

01:58:02.596 --> 01:58:05.190
Senators, Romans...

01:58:05.796 --> 01:58:10.790
As you know, there exists today
in our empire, and even in Rome itself,

01:58:11.196 --> 01:58:17.305
a secret party of seditionists
who call themselves Christians.

01:58:19.076 --> 01:58:25.345
They have enlisted in their ranks the riffraff
of the plebeian class, as well as slaves.

01:58:26.316 --> 01:58:29.786
We have known slave uprisings in the past.

01:58:29.876 --> 01:58:32.185
We remember Spartacus.

01:58:32.596 --> 01:58:36.066
But now it grieves us to inform you

01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:40.391
that one of our own tribunes
has betrayed his trust

01:58:40.476 --> 01:58:44.355
and joined this party of conspirators.

01:58:45.796 --> 01:58:50.153
You, not we, shall be
the judges of his treason.

01:58:50.716 --> 01:58:53.184
Bring in Tribune Marcellus Gallio.

01:59:47.036 --> 01:59:51.234
Tribune Gallio, you have been informed
of the charges against you?

01:59:51.316 --> 01:59:52.305
I have, sire.

01:59:52.396 --> 01:59:55.468
You stand before
the senators and nobles of Rome.

01:59:55.556 --> 01:59:57.945
They wait to hear your defence.

02:00:02.276 --> 02:00:04.471
It is true that I am a Christian.

02:00:07.596 --> 02:00:11.589
It is not true that those of us
who follow the teachings of Jesus

02:00:11.676 --> 02:00:14.349
are engaged in any plot against the state.

02:00:14.436 --> 02:00:20.147
But isn't it a fact that
you call this Jesus a king?

02:00:20.716 --> 02:00:22.707
Yes, sire.

02:00:23.236 --> 02:00:25.750
But his kingdom is not of this world.

02:00:26.956 --> 02:00:28.992
He seeks no earthly throne.

02:00:29.516 --> 02:00:33.748
He reigns over the hearts and minds of men
in the name ofjustice and charity.

02:00:33.836 --> 02:00:36.908
And are these virtues
not to be found in our empire?

02:00:37.356 --> 02:00:40.792
Was it justice, or was it charity
that gave me my orders

02:00:40.876 --> 02:00:43.595
when I put him to death on the cross?

02:00:44.356 --> 02:00:46.824
You put him to death?

02:00:46.916 --> 02:00:49.953
Then why are you risking your life for him?

02:00:50.556 --> 02:00:52.911
I owe him more than my life.

02:00:54.196 --> 02:00:57.506
- He forgave me my crime against him.
- Crime?

02:00:57.916 --> 02:01:02.307
Do you maintain that it's a crime
for a Roman soldier to obey his orders?

02:01:02.396 --> 02:01:04.751
The empire is governed by men.

02:01:05.356 --> 02:01:10.589
Men sometimes make mistakes. And this
was the greatest mistake ever made by Rome.

02:01:10.676 --> 02:01:13.110
So, the empire makes mistakes.

02:01:13.916 --> 02:01:17.272
And perhaps the emperor
himself makes mistakes?

02:01:17.676 --> 02:01:19.667
Sire,

02:01:19.756 --> 02:01:23.669
it is I who am on trial here, not you.

02:01:28.196 --> 02:01:30.551
What's that thing you're holding?

02:01:30.636 --> 02:01:33.434
His robe. He wore it to the cross.

02:01:33.516 --> 02:01:35.711
Let me see it.

02:01:37.596 --> 02:01:40.429
No. I remember. It's bewitched.

02:01:40.516 --> 02:01:43.110
- No, sire.
- You. Take it.

02:01:43.476 --> 02:01:45.865
- Destroy it.
- Sire, may I keep it?

02:01:53.236 --> 02:01:55.431
Sorcery too.

02:01:55.516 --> 02:01:58.110
Did you think it would protect you here?

02:01:58.916 --> 02:02:01.032
- No, sire.
- Tell me, Tribune.

02:02:01.116 --> 02:02:05.667
Do you expect us to believe stories that
Jesus could heal by the touch of his hand,

02:02:05.756 --> 02:02:08.714
make the crippled walk
and the blind see again?

02:02:10.036 --> 02:02:13.665
It makes no difference whether
you believe them or not, sire.

02:02:13.756 --> 02:02:18.466
All that matters is that there's no story
that he ever made anyone blind,

02:02:18.556 --> 02:02:20.990
no story that he made anyone a cripple,

02:02:21.076 --> 02:02:23.715
or ever raised his hand except to heal.

02:02:24.316 --> 02:02:26.784
Sire, if you'd had the chance I had,

02:02:27.396 --> 02:02:30.991
to talk with those who knew him,
to learn what was in his heart...

02:02:31.076 --> 02:02:34.386
Stop. Are you trying
to convert me to your treason?

02:02:34.796 --> 02:02:37.230
I only want to show you
your opportunity, sire.

02:02:37.316 --> 02:02:40.991
If the empire desires peace
and brotherhood among all men,

02:02:41.076 --> 02:02:44.352
then my king will be on the side
of Rome and her emperor.

02:02:45.076 --> 02:02:49.513
But if the empire and the emperor pursue
the course of aggression and slavery

02:02:49.596 --> 02:02:52.429
that have brought agony
and despair to the world,

02:02:52.516 --> 02:02:55.189
if there's nothing left but chains and hunger,

02:02:55.276 --> 02:02:57.790
then my king will march
to right those wrongs.

02:02:57.876 --> 02:03:02.506
Not tomorrow, sire. Your Majesty may not
witness the establishment of his kingdom.

02:03:02.596 --> 02:03:05.190
But it will come.

02:03:08.716 --> 02:03:12.709
You have heard him. He stands
convicted out of his own mouth.

02:03:13.636 --> 02:03:15.866
What is your pleasure?

02:03:20.396 --> 02:03:22.273
Death.

02:03:22.476 --> 02:03:24.034
Death.

02:03:32.116 --> 02:03:34.186
You see? It is the will of the people.

02:03:34.276 --> 02:03:38.110
The will of your slaves and parasites.
How dare you speak ofjustice?

02:03:38.196 --> 02:03:41.586
He's not a traitor. You haven't
proved that and you never will.

02:03:41.676 --> 02:03:44.349
Then listen. You will see that I am just.

02:03:44.756 --> 02:03:48.510
Listen. Tribune Gallio,
you stand condemned to death.

02:03:48.596 --> 02:03:50.666
But it is our desire to be merciful.

02:03:50.756 --> 02:03:53.509
We give you a chance
to recant your treason and go free.

02:03:53.596 --> 02:03:56.872
Kneel to us and renew your oath
of loyalty to your emperor.

02:03:56.956 --> 02:04:01.666
Renounce your allegiance to this dead Jew
who dared to call himself a king.

02:04:23.316 --> 02:04:25.307
Sire...

02:04:26.796 --> 02:04:31.586
With all my heart I renew my pledge
of loyalty to my emperor and to Rome,

02:04:33.036 --> 02:04:35.186
a pledge which I have never broken.

02:04:35.276 --> 02:04:37.631
And the other? Jesus?

02:04:37.716 --> 02:04:40.310
Renounce him, so all can hear.

02:04:47.076 --> 02:04:49.874
I cannot renounce him, sire. Nor can you.

02:04:50.476 --> 02:04:52.671
He is my king and yours as well.

02:04:53.476 --> 02:04:55.671
He is the Son of God.

02:04:56.996 --> 02:04:59.874
- And that is your answer?
- Yes, sire.

02:05:03.236 --> 02:05:07.752
Tribune Gallio, we decree that you be taken
immediately to the palace archery field

02:05:07.836 --> 02:05:10.304
and put to death for high treason.

02:05:15.676 --> 02:05:18.395
No, Diana. There's no reason for it.

02:05:18.476 --> 02:05:20.910
Sire, Marcellus is my chosen husband.

02:05:20.996 --> 02:05:23.351
- I ask to go with him.
- Stand back.

02:05:23.436 --> 02:05:26.314
You're not on trial.
There's no evidence against you.

02:05:26.396 --> 02:05:29.832
Then if it please you, sire,
I'll provide evidence.

02:05:29.916 --> 02:05:33.909
I have no wish to live another hour
in an empire ruled by you.

02:05:35.236 --> 02:05:37.386
You dare to call yourself a Caesar.

02:05:38.036 --> 02:05:43.030
Once the Caesars of Rome were noble, but
in you noble blood has turned to poison.

02:05:43.116 --> 02:05:45.107
You corrupt Rome with spite and malice.

02:05:45.196 --> 02:05:47.426
- Stop. Stop it!
- That you should be Caesar!

02:05:47.796 --> 02:05:50.788
Vicious, treacherous, drunk with power.

02:05:51.196 --> 02:05:54.029
An evil, insane monster posing as emperor.

02:05:54.196 --> 02:05:55.424
Stop it!

02:05:55.516 --> 02:05:58.076
As for me, I have found another king.

02:05:59.276 --> 02:06:02.746
I want to go with my husband
into his kingdom.

02:06:04.076 --> 02:06:06.385
Then by the gods you shall.

02:06:06.796 --> 02:06:10.584
Go. Both of you. Into your kingdom!

02:06:49.076 --> 02:06:51.271
They're going into a better kingdom.

02:06:51.476 --> 02:06:54.115
They're going into a better kingdom.

02:06:54.316 --> 02:06:56.386
They're going to meet their king.

02:06:56.596 --> 02:06:58.666
They're going to meet their king.

02:07:03.156 --> 02:07:05.351
For the big fisherman.

02:07:51.676 --> 02:07:53.906
