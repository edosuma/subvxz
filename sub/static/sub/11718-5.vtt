05:29.119 --> 05:30.203

05:30.287 --> 05:31.871
She doesn't want
to talk to me.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.357
What about McGarrett?

05:34.408 --> 05:35.625
Have you talked
to him about it?

05:35.692 --> 05:37.026
No, not yet.

05:37.077 --> 05:40.513
Not until I know for sure

the women's volleyball team.

06:13.614 --> 06:15.915
Looks like our guy was
coming out of the shower

06:15.983 --> 06:17.817
when he was attacked;
killer slit his throat.

06:17.885 --> 06:19.919
Cell phone and wallet
are missing.

06:19.987 --> 06:22.205
Otherwise, nothing else appears
to have been disturbed.

06:22.256 --> 06:24.173
So, what,
robbery gone bad?

06:24.241 --> 06:26.075
No, more than that.

06:26.126 --> 06:28.344
Check out the, uh, bruising
here along the ribs.

06:28.412 --> 06:31.848
All right, this is
a serious beating this guy got.

06:31.915 --> 06:33.266
He must have
pissed somebody off.

06:33.350 --> 06:34.634
Either that
or somebody wanted information

06:34.718 --> 06:36.236
out of this guy.

06:36.303 --> 06:37.520
HPD hasn't turned up
any witnesses.

06:37.588 --> 06:39.472
Last people to see him alive
were his players.

06:39.557 --> 06:41.190
Bunch of them came down
after the game

06:41.258 --> 06:42.475
and gave him a Gatorade bath.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.476
Explains the shower.

06:43.561 --> 06:45.612
Everybody says his team
loved him.

06:45.696 --> 06:47.146
Same with the fans,
athletic department

06:47.231 --> 06:48.264
and even the media.

06:48.315 --> 06:49.449
Yeah, alums liked him, too.

06:49.533 --> 06:50.867
He was living
in a guesthouse

06:50.934 --> 06:52.902
on the property
of a rich couple.

06:52.953 --> 06:54.203
Karl and Trisha Joyner.

06:54.271 --> 06:55.938
Live out in Kahala.

06:55.990 --> 06:57.574
Yeah, well, somebody
had beef with this guy.

06:57.625 --> 06:58.625
Game was televised.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.610
Maybe the cameras
caught something.

07:00.661 --> 07:02.128
All right, you and Chin
go through the footage.

07:02.212 --> 07:04.330
Danny and I-- we're gonna go
to Kahala, see what turns up.

07:06.617 --> 07:09.469
<i>Let me ask you a question.</i>

07:09.536 --> 07:11.671
What do you think, uh, one of
these places costs? That place?

07:11.755 --> 07:12.839
Right there, what's that cost?

07:12.923 --> 07:14.807
Hell of a lot more than
you and I earn, bruh.

07:14.892 --> 07:16.059
Mm-hmm.
Hell of a lot more

07:16.126 --> 07:18.311
than a college volleyball coach
earns, too, right?

07:18.395 --> 07:19.929
Yet, this guy Scartelli
is living it up.

07:19.980 --> 07:21.514
Some guys have all the luck,
I guess.

07:21.599 --> 07:22.849
Oh, yeah, Danny, lucky.

07:22.933 --> 07:24.901
I mean, he's dead, okay?
But he's a lucky guy

07:24.968 --> 07:26.686
'cause look at the house
he's living in.

07:26.770 --> 07:28.354
This is my point, okay?

07:28.439 --> 07:30.356
What are the perks
of being a cop?

07:30.441 --> 07:31.474
Well...
Pay sucks,

07:31.525 --> 07:33.176
the hours suck,

07:33.243 --> 07:36.129
sometimes, I get-- no, no,
not sometimes-- all the time,

07:36.196 --> 07:37.830
I get shot at
all the time.

07:37.915 --> 07:38.981
What are you talking about?

07:39.033 --> 07:40.249
You never--
you hardly ever get shot at.

07:40.317 --> 07:41.701
Is that a joke?
You making a joke?

07:41.785 --> 07:43.036
Okay, when was the last time
you got clipped?

07:43.103 --> 07:44.837
You're not a funny person.

07:44.922 --> 07:45.888
Are you trying to be funny?
You're not.

07:45.956 --> 07:47.090
Okay, here's my point.

07:47.157 --> 07:48.841
All right,
living practically rent-free

07:48.926 --> 07:50.343
in some rich guy's guesthouse

07:50.411 --> 07:52.128
seems to me like
a nice perk, okay,

07:52.179 --> 07:53.630
for keeping the
world a safer place.

07:53.697 --> 07:54.914
You homeless now?

07:54.982 --> 07:56.349
Why don't you try
decorating, Danny.

07:56.433 --> 07:58.051
Like, get some doilies
for the tables,

07:58.135 --> 07:59.969
some flowers for
the front room.

08:00.020 --> 08:01.554
You scoff, okay,
but that homeless scenario

08:01.639 --> 08:03.189
is not very far off for me.

08:03.273 --> 08:04.507
You know I'm getting kicked out

08:04.558 --> 08:06.109
of my apartment?
What are you talking about?

08:06.176 --> 08:08.678
Knocking down my building,
turning it into luxury condos,

08:08.729 --> 08:11.514
'cause that's what this
island needs, more condos.

08:11.582 --> 08:12.882
<i>I don't understand.</i>

08:12.950 --> 08:14.867
Everybody loves Brian.

08:14.952 --> 08:16.369
Who would do this?

08:16.453 --> 08:18.454
That's what we're trying to
figure out right now, sir.

08:18.522 --> 08:19.906
Um, it would be
very helpful to us

08:19.990 --> 08:21.908
if we could see
where he was staying.

08:21.992 --> 08:23.743
Sure, yeah.

08:23.827 --> 08:25.495
This way.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.618
Anything, uh, out
of the ordinary

08:32.686 --> 08:34.220
with the coach
recently?

08:34.288 --> 08:35.538
I don't think so.

08:35.589 --> 08:37.423
Everything was good.

08:37.491 --> 08:38.758
Team was on track

08:38.826 --> 08:41.059
to go all the way
this season.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.996
As long as his girls are happy,
Brian's happy.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.464
His girls?
You talking about the players?

08:44.531 --> 08:47.383
That's what Brian
calls them.

08:47.434 --> 08:49.885
Called them.

08:49.937 --> 08:52.939
He was like a second father
to his players.

08:56.010 --> 08:57.527
This place is
completely ridiculous, okay?

08:57.578 --> 08:59.829
They got a steam-- you see
the steam shower in there?

08:59.896 --> 09:01.147
Their bathroom is bigger

09:01.215 --> 09:02.865
than my entire apartment, okay?
Yeah.

09:02.916 --> 09:05.618
And they have a lap pool
specifically for the guesthouse.

09:05.703 --> 09:07.003
The guesthouse has
their own pool.

09:07.070 --> 09:08.171
Lap pool?
Yeah.

09:08.238 --> 09:09.455
Their own pool.

09:09.540 --> 09:11.507
Whoa.

09:11.575 --> 09:13.009
I have some photographs.

09:15.129 --> 09:16.462
So Scartelli took photos
of his girlfriend.

09:16.547 --> 09:18.064
He isn't the first guy
to do that.

09:18.132 --> 09:19.048
Okay.

09:21.251 --> 09:22.752
She's, uh, she's young.

09:22.803 --> 09:23.919
Yeah, she's young.

09:23.971 --> 09:25.304
She's also one of
Scartelli's players.

09:26.974 --> 09:28.808
All right, upload these
to our Sky Drive.

09:28.892 --> 09:30.092
See if Chin and Lori

09:30.144 --> 09:32.445
can lock on
who this girl is.

09:36.900 --> 09:40.319
I do not think that these were
taken by a second father.

09:40.404 --> 09:41.937
Yeah, well, maybe
her real father

09:41.989 --> 09:43.539
or her boyfriend
found out

09:43.607 --> 09:45.441
what was going on
off the court between these two.

09:45.492 --> 09:46.843
Yeah, that's a good point.

09:46.910 --> 09:48.944
'Cause if I found out somebody
taking pictures of Grace

09:48.996 --> 09:50.446
like this, I'd go to their house

09:50.497 --> 09:51.447
and I'd kill them.

09:51.498 --> 09:53.232
Yeah, me, too.

10:04.561 --> 10:05.524
You get a name?

10:05.525 --> 10:06.609
Got more than that.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.813
We ran the photos that
you put up on Sky Drive.

10:08.814 --> 10:10.431
Girl in the pics
is Melanie Ayers.

10:10.483 --> 10:12.767
We're looking at her I.D.
right now.

10:12.818 --> 10:13.952
She's the team's star player,

10:14.036 --> 10:15.153
and according to
the video footage

10:15.238 --> 10:16.521
that Chin and I went through,

10:16.589 --> 10:18.089
she's the only team member
that wasn't

10:18.157 --> 10:19.874
at the game last night.
Okay, why? Is she injured?

10:19.942 --> 10:21.426
No, she was
supposed to play.

10:21.494 --> 10:22.744
According to the coach's
phone records,

10:22.795 --> 10:24.996
he was talking to Melanie
six or seven times a day

10:25.064 --> 10:26.047
for the last couple of weeks.

10:26.115 --> 10:27.048
He have that kind of contact

10:27.116 --> 10:28.133
with any of his other players?

10:28.217 --> 10:29.301
No, just her.

10:29.368 --> 10:30.802
And in an interview she gave

10:30.886 --> 10:32.287
to the college paper,
Melanie referenced

10:32.338 --> 10:34.506
a serious relationship with
someone, but denied it was with

10:34.574 --> 10:35.724
another UH student.

10:35.791 --> 10:36.958
I'm betting she didn't
say anything

10:37.009 --> 10:38.760
about the coach being like
a second father, either.

10:38.811 --> 10:39.844
Last but not least,

10:39.929 --> 10:42.213
we pulled Scartelli's
financials.

10:42.281 --> 10:44.466
He was renting a motel
room out in Aiea.

10:44.533 --> 10:45.900
He prepaid for
an entire week.

10:45.968 --> 10:47.068
Doesn't make sense.

10:47.136 --> 10:48.903
Guy's got a luxury
pad here in Kahala.

10:48.971 --> 10:51.323
No. Crappy motel room
all the way up in Aiea

10:51.407 --> 10:52.824
would make sense if Scartelli
had something to hide.

10:52.908 --> 10:54.359
All right, you know
what, I think it's time

10:54.443 --> 10:56.161
to see what Melanie Ayers
has to say about this.

10:56.245 --> 10:58.163
Danny and I are gonna go
and talk to her.

10:58.247 --> 10:59.531
Chin, you and Lori
head out to Aiea,

10:59.615 --> 11:00.982
check out that motel, all right?

11:01.033 --> 11:02.150
Okay, good.

11:02.218 --> 11:04.502
Wait... wait a minute.

11:04.587 --> 11:05.954
You think I was having an affair

11:06.005 --> 11:07.589
with Coach Scartelli?

11:07.656 --> 11:09.674
No.

11:09.759 --> 11:11.259
You think he took

11:11.327 --> 11:12.493
these pictures?

11:12.545 --> 11:13.845
He didn't take those pictures?
No.

11:13.929 --> 11:16.264
No. No. God, no.

11:16.332 --> 11:17.299
Okay. Who did?

11:17.350 --> 11:18.633
V-Cross.

11:18.684 --> 11:21.136
V-Cross-- that's a
sneaker company.

11:21.187 --> 11:23.638
Yeah. They sponsor the team.

11:23.689 --> 11:26.224
I was going to do
an ad campaign for them.

11:26.309 --> 11:30.111
So we did a photo shoot,
and some of the pictures

11:30.179 --> 11:31.563
came out a little...

11:31.647 --> 11:33.231
you know.

11:33.316 --> 11:35.867
Wait a minute.
An ad campaign-- isn't that

11:35.951 --> 11:37.535
against regulations
for college players?

11:37.620 --> 11:39.070
Yeah.

11:39.138 --> 11:41.656
But they offered me 150 grand.

11:41.707 --> 11:43.575
I mean, that's a lot of money.

11:45.628 --> 11:47.829
When Coach found out
about it, he benched me.

11:47.880 --> 11:48.913
Okay, so that's why

11:48.998 --> 11:50.498
you weren't at the game
the other night?

11:50.549 --> 11:52.367
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
he was going to ask

11:52.418 --> 11:54.085
for a ruling
before I could play again.

11:55.137 --> 11:56.638
Look, I made
a stupid mistake.

11:56.705 --> 11:59.224
All right? Coach was helping me
fix it. That's all.

11:59.308 --> 12:01.092
All right.

12:09.769 --> 12:11.936
It's not a good time
for me, Malia.

12:12.004 --> 12:14.356
That's what I hear.

12:15.574 --> 12:17.575
What's that supposed to mean?

12:17.660 --> 12:19.944
Can I come in?

12:22.564 --> 12:25.200
Kono, I know things

12:25.251 --> 12:27.902
have been weird between us
since Chin and I broke up,

12:27.953 --> 12:31.339
and I'm... I'm
sorry about that,

12:31.407 --> 12:33.091
but this is important.

12:33.175 --> 12:35.009
Chin is worried about you.

12:35.077 --> 12:39.080
Wait. So, what, are...
are you and Chin back together?

12:40.399 --> 12:42.217
Well, um, uh...

12:42.268 --> 12:43.685
I don't know.

12:43.752 --> 12:45.086
Maybe.

12:46.105 --> 12:47.722
Wow. How'd you manage that?

12:50.609 --> 12:53.395
Do you remember when you
were in high school

12:53.446 --> 12:55.563
and Chin and I
used to drive you

12:55.614 --> 12:58.450
all around the Island
to those surf competitions?

12:58.534 --> 13:00.318
The NSSA's.

13:00.403 --> 13:02.821
Chin was so proud of you.

13:02.905 --> 13:05.623
I mean, that's how I knew
he was serious about me--

13:05.708 --> 13:06.958
because he wanted to share

13:07.042 --> 13:10.245
how proud
he was of you.

13:12.581 --> 13:16.134
I don't expect you
to understand, Kono,

13:16.218 --> 13:21.089
but Chin and me--
we have something special.

13:22.124 --> 13:23.892
Yeah.

13:23.959 --> 13:26.678
Where was that something special
when he lost his badge?

13:32.685 --> 13:35.253
Kono.

13:35.321 --> 13:36.988
Right now?

13:37.072 --> 13:38.773
Okay.

13:38.824 --> 13:40.508
Look, as much as I would love

13:40.576 --> 13:41.910
to continue this conversation,
I can't.

13:41.977 --> 13:43.528
I got to run.
Kono.

13:43.612 --> 13:45.813
And the next time you're looking
to score points with Chin,

13:45.865 --> 13:47.482
leave me out of it.

13:57.510 --> 13:59.394
I've seen the man,

13:59.462 --> 14:01.279
but that's not the woman
he was with.

14:01.347 --> 14:03.381
You're sure?
Positive.

14:03.466 --> 14:04.849
Nice lady.

14:04.934 --> 14:06.468
You get a name?

14:06.519 --> 14:09.220
No, but you could ask her
yourself.

14:09.305 --> 14:10.855
She hasn't
checked out.

14:10.940 --> 14:13.024
She's in room 104.

14:13.108 --> 14:14.476
Thank you.

14:16.028 --> 14:17.445
Looks like our mystery lady's
coming back.

14:20.115 --> 14:21.566
Hold on.

14:23.152 --> 14:24.569
I got a print.

14:24.653 --> 14:27.372
Let's see if Fong gets a hit.

14:34.797 --> 14:36.548
There's a message here, too.

14:36.632 --> 14:37.865
Trisha, it's Brian.

14:37.917 --> 14:39.200
I want you to stay put.

14:39.251 --> 14:40.969
He knows you left,
and he's flipping out.

14:41.036 --> 14:43.888
Give me a little time
to talk him down.

14:43.973 --> 14:46.424
I'll check with you as soon as I can.
That's the coach.

14:48.978 --> 14:50.678
Okay, Fong got a hit.

14:50.729 --> 14:53.598
Print belongs to a former
schoolteacher, Trisha Joyner.

14:55.384 --> 14:56.634
He sent her
DMV photo.

14:56.702 --> 14:58.636
Trisha Joyner--
that's Karl Joyner's wife.

14:59.688 --> 15:02.106
Scartelli was staying
at their guesthouse.

15:03.559 --> 15:04.826
<i>Chin.</i>

15:04.893 --> 15:06.211
<i>Hey.</i>

15:06.278 --> 15:07.996
<i>Scartelli rented a motel room</i>
<i>for Trisha Joyner.</i>

15:08.063 --> 15:09.914
Sounds like she's
leaving her husband.

15:09.999 --> 15:11.115
Oh, that's
got to hurt.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.567
Open your guesthouse
up to a guy,

15:12.618 --> 15:14.002
he eats your food,
drinks your beer

15:14.069 --> 15:15.370
and helps himself to your wife.

15:15.421 --> 15:17.505
Well, according to the message
we heard, Karl Joyner

15:17.573 --> 15:18.590
wasn't taking it too well.

15:18.674 --> 15:19.791
All right, you
guys, you wait

15:19.875 --> 15:21.409
at the hotel for
Trish to come back.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.461
Danny and I are going
to go find Karl Joyner.

15:33.973 --> 15:34.973
Look at this.

15:35.057 --> 15:37.091
He's moving.
He's got a gun.

15:37.142 --> 15:39.561
Gun.

15:41.347 --> 15:43.865
Karl Joyner, let me see
your hands right now.

15:43.932 --> 15:44.932
Right now!

15:44.984 --> 15:46.767
Don't shoot me. Please.

15:46.819 --> 15:49.704
You don't understand.
I need to find my wife.

15:49.771 --> 15:51.205
They're after her!

15:51.273 --> 15:52.707
Danny!

16:10.333 --> 16:11.884
Hey.

16:13.446 --> 16:16.198
All right.

16:16.624 --> 16:19.125
I got boot prints and
burn marks over here.

16:19.193 --> 16:22.212
I'm thinking single
sniper, bipod.

16:22.279 --> 16:24.797
Rifle had to have
been a semiautomatic

16:24.882 --> 16:26.749
to deliver two shots
the way it did.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.419
Plus he had to get through
some pretty heavy tree cover.

16:29.470 --> 16:32.305
He had to be about 600 feet
from where Joyner was standing.

16:32.389 --> 16:33.789
At least.
Plus there's wind.

16:33.841 --> 16:36.509
Okay? Whoever killed
Joyner was a pro.

16:38.295 --> 16:40.096
Okay, this is starting
to look a lot less

16:40.147 --> 16:41.964
like a love triangle gone bad.
Wait a minute.

16:42.016 --> 16:43.466
Right before he went
down, Joyner said

16:43.517 --> 16:44.767
that somebody was
after his wife.

16:44.818 --> 16:46.686
Who'd be after his wife?
I don't know,

16:46.770 --> 16:48.071
but where the hell
is his wife?

16:48.138 --> 16:49.856
We need to find out
what Joyner was into.

16:58.332 --> 16:59.616
Hey.

16:59.667 --> 17:02.135
Okay, so this guy was
definitely dirty.

17:02.202 --> 17:04.503
On paper, Karl Joyner
owned a bunch

17:04.571 --> 17:06.172
of dry cleaning stores
throughout Honolulu.

17:06.257 --> 17:08.057
Perfectly respectable way
to maintain

17:08.125 --> 17:09.675
his champagne and
caviar lifestyle.

17:09.760 --> 17:10.877
Let me guess--
they're all fronts.

17:10.961 --> 17:12.428
Yes. Uh, all the
payroll employees

17:12.496 --> 17:14.012
were bogus names

17:14.098 --> 17:16.165
and social security numbers,
except for Joyner himself.

17:16.215 --> 17:17.517
All right,
so the stores--

17:17.601 --> 17:19.218
they brought in
a decent amount of dough,

17:19.303 --> 17:20.686
but nothing compared
to the actual revenue

17:20.771 --> 17:22.171
that was on
the books.

17:22.222 --> 17:23.673
This guy was definitely
in the cleaning business,

17:23.723 --> 17:25.675
but he wasn't cleaning clothes;
he was laundering money.

17:25.726 --> 17:27.527
Right. Okay. So what happened?
What went wrong?

17:27.611 --> 17:30.163
Uh, the bank account zeroed out
a few days ago.

17:30.165 --> 17:31.067
Maybe he got greedy.

17:31.092 --> 17:32.807
We got any leads
on who he was working for?

17:33.117 --> 17:34.367
Not yet, but whoever it is,

17:34.451 --> 17:35.785
I think that they want
their money back.

17:35.852 --> 17:36.953
Yeah, they do.

17:37.020 --> 17:38.288
They just killed Karl Joyner.

17:38.355 --> 17:39.739
Now they think
his wife has it.

17:39.823 --> 17:41.307
We got to find her.

17:44.662 --> 17:47.363
Trisha's got to be
back soon, right?

17:47.414 --> 17:48.998
Well, she left all her clothes.

17:49.049 --> 17:50.500
She didn't check out.

17:50.551 --> 17:52.418
She'll be back.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.871
Right.

17:55.923 --> 17:57.256
Want this?

17:57.341 --> 17:58.841
No, thanks.

17:59.876 --> 18:01.311
What, you don't
want to know

18:01.378 --> 18:02.979
what men really think
about foreplay

18:03.046 --> 18:04.981
or how to wax
like a pro?

18:05.048 --> 18:06.849
Not so much.

18:08.736 --> 18:10.353
Fair enough.

18:23.651 --> 18:26.336
Sorry. Uh, patience
isn't my strong suit.

18:29.506 --> 18:31.541
You're a lot like Steve,
you know that?

18:32.876 --> 18:34.293
Am I?

18:34.361 --> 18:35.595
Mm-hmm.

18:38.048 --> 18:39.682
What's his deal anyway?

18:39.750 --> 18:41.851
What do you mean,
what's his deal?

18:41.918 --> 18:43.302
Oh, I don't know.

18:43.387 --> 18:45.972
I mean, he's...
I mean, he's kind of hard

18:46.056 --> 18:48.691
to get a read on, you know,
uh, except for the...

18:48.759 --> 18:50.193
you know, the daddy issues.

18:50.260 --> 18:54.147
Those are right out there
front and center.

18:54.231 --> 18:56.532
And not... not like I'm trying

18:56.600 --> 18:57.884
to, like, shrink him
or anything,

18:57.951 --> 19:00.319
'cause I'm not--
I'm totally not--

19:00.404 --> 19:01.904
but, uh...

19:01.955 --> 19:03.423
I don't know.

19:03.490 --> 19:06.125
Just sort of like to, you know,

19:06.210 --> 19:09.662
get to know my new boss
a little better... is all.

19:14.918 --> 19:16.502
Okay. Sorry.

19:16.587 --> 19:18.087
Is this awkward?

19:18.138 --> 19:19.555
Okay, it's awkward.

19:19.623 --> 19:20.923
Let's just...

19:20.974 --> 19:22.642
rewind.

19:22.726 --> 19:24.811
Delete.
I never said anything.

19:24.878 --> 19:26.379
It's not a big deal.

19:26.447 --> 19:27.897
You got it.

19:27.964 --> 19:29.182
Okay, great.

19:30.768 --> 19:32.268
Someone's here.

19:36.390 --> 19:37.924
Gun!

19:55.325 --> 19:56.609
Go!

20:01.849 --> 20:03.433
Hold your fire!

20:03.500 --> 20:05.101
Why?

20:05.168 --> 20:07.637
The driver--

20:07.688 --> 20:10.723
it's my cousin.

20:23.287 --> 20:24.854
Want to tell me
what's going on?

20:27.207 --> 20:29.158
I didn't know it was this bad.

20:29.209 --> 20:31.494
Why don't we start
with what you did know?

20:31.545 --> 20:33.079
I knew what we all knew.

20:33.163 --> 20:34.297
Kono lost her badge.

20:34.364 --> 20:35.882
She's been in
a bad place.

20:35.966 --> 20:39.969
Steve, she hacked into the
HPD database using my password.

20:40.036 --> 20:41.471
When I asked her
about it, she said

20:41.538 --> 20:42.672
she wanted to see her case file.

20:42.723 --> 20:43.673
What's her connection to Joyner

20:43.724 --> 20:44.841
and his money laundering
business?

20:44.892 --> 20:46.175
I don't know.
I've never seen her

20:46.226 --> 20:47.510
with the thug
she was with today.

20:47.561 --> 20:49.061
She's hanging with guys
like Ray Mapes now.

20:49.146 --> 20:51.481
Who is Ray Mapes, Chin?

20:51.548 --> 20:54.016
Ray Mapes is an ex-cop.

20:54.067 --> 20:55.718
He lost his badge
when he got caught

20:55.769 --> 20:57.436
shaking down
drug dealers.

20:57.504 --> 20:59.238
I figured that she was feeling

20:59.323 --> 21:01.274
like that's all
she was good enough for.

21:02.326 --> 21:04.443
I know that feeling.

21:04.528 --> 21:06.195
How did it get this far, huh?

21:06.246 --> 21:08.080
Why didn't she come to us?

21:08.165 --> 21:10.116
I don't know.
I don't know what she's into.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.584
I don't know how deep she's in.

21:11.668 --> 21:13.452
And I don't know
if we can protect her anymore.

21:13.537 --> 21:14.637
Do you understand that?

21:14.705 --> 21:16.455
I know.

21:16.540 --> 21:19.258
I should have
told you.

21:19.343 --> 21:22.211
I should've.

21:22.262 --> 21:23.880
I'm sorry.

21:27.250 --> 21:28.885
Did Kono see you today?

21:28.936 --> 21:30.937
I don't think so.

21:34.925 --> 21:36.809
Get a lock on Kono's cell.

21:36.877 --> 21:38.861
We're bringing her in.

21:45.202 --> 21:46.369
Hold on.

21:46.436 --> 21:48.905
You're going
to be okay.

21:52.242 --> 21:53.492
Hold on, Dwight.

21:58.382 --> 21:59.832
Dwight?

22:01.301 --> 22:03.753
Dwight?

22:08.926 --> 22:10.560
Hello?

22:10.627 --> 22:12.762
- Where's Dwight?
- Frank?

22:12.813 --> 22:13.646
He can't talk right now.

22:13.730 --> 22:15.982
You get her?

22:16.066 --> 22:18.017
What the hell is going on here?

22:18.101 --> 22:19.018
Did you get her?

22:19.086 --> 22:20.403
- Get who?
- Trisha Joyner.

22:20.470 --> 22:21.404
The bitch who's got my money.

22:21.471 --> 22:23.305
I have no idea about that.

22:23.357 --> 22:26.058
All I know is that Dwight called
and told me I was gonna

22:26.126 --> 22:27.777
take him to a motel in Aiea,

22:27.828 --> 22:30.029
but then when we got there,
HPD was on the scene

22:30.113 --> 22:33.032
and they opened fire.
Dwight's been hit.

22:33.116 --> 22:34.116
Is he alive?

22:35.669 --> 22:37.086
I don't think so.

22:37.153 --> 22:39.255
Don't think. Make sure.

22:50.467 --> 22:52.334
He's dead.

22:54.304 --> 22:56.639
Go dump him off
of the Pau Lane Bridge

22:56.690 --> 23:00.026
then get right back into town.

23:00.110 --> 23:01.277
What?

23:01.344 --> 23:05.147
You wanted in. You're in.

23:48.825 --> 23:51.027
Get out of the car, Kono!

24:00.003 --> 24:02.237
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

24:12.933 --> 24:14.350
Lori.

24:47.884 --> 24:50.002
I want to help you, Kono, okay?

24:50.087 --> 24:52.304
I really want to help you,
you gotta help me.

24:52.389 --> 24:54.840
You gotta tell me
what's going on.

24:54.925 --> 24:55.975
I can't.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.476
You can't! Listen to me!

24:57.561 --> 25:00.980
That's not good enough!
"I can't" is not good enough

25:01.064 --> 25:04.183
because today, you're driving in
a getaway car with a dead person

25:04.267 --> 25:06.102
in the front seat,
okay, Kono?

25:06.153 --> 25:09.188
This isn't a game!
We're talking about two murders!

25:09.272 --> 25:11.857
I mean, what
are you thinking, Kono, huh?!

25:11.942 --> 25:13.109
Steve. Steve!

25:13.160 --> 25:14.443
What?!

25:21.902 --> 25:23.085
Not like this.

25:25.488 --> 25:27.289
Let me talk to her.

25:38.769 --> 25:41.336
Whatever you're into, I'm here.

25:42.889 --> 25:44.690
We're family, right?

25:44.758 --> 25:46.559
Hmm?

25:46.643 --> 25:48.978
Nothing's ever
gonna change that.

25:53.984 --> 25:57.653
Listen to me, you're not alone.

25:57.704 --> 26:02.958
Not today, not tomorrow,
not any of the days ahead.

26:03.026 --> 26:06.495
You're not alone
'cause I'm right here.

26:08.582 --> 26:11.533
But you need
to come clean, Kono.

26:11.585 --> 26:15.004
You need
to talk to me, hmm?

26:16.256 --> 26:19.708
All you have
to do is talk to me.

26:19.759 --> 26:21.877
Please?

26:24.380 --> 26:25.564
I can't.

26:27.934 --> 26:31.103
Hey, Captain Fryer, what
the hell are you doing here?

26:31.188 --> 26:32.404
You're done here, McGarrett.

26:32.489 --> 26:33.439
Kono, get up.

26:33.523 --> 26:35.875
Hey, hey!
She's in custody.

26:35.942 --> 26:37.243
Oh, no, she's mine.

26:37.327 --> 26:38.360
What are you talking about,
she's yours?

26:38.411 --> 26:39.561
This has nothing to do with IA.

26:39.613 --> 26:42.397
Wrong again.
She's working for me.

26:54.910 --> 26:56.277
Fryer, you think

26:56.329 --> 26:59.030
you can just come in here and
mess with my team like this?

26:59.115 --> 27:01.315
Don't flatter yourself
McGarrett. This has nothing

27:01.367 --> 27:02.534
to do with you.

27:02.618 --> 27:04.586
You're interfering in
a murder investigation!

27:04.653 --> 27:07.205
My investigation includes
your murder investigation, okay?

27:07.289 --> 27:08.540
What are you talking about?

27:08.624 --> 27:10.742
I can't believe you didn't
bring this to me.

27:10.810 --> 27:12.177
It went too far!

27:12.244 --> 27:14.596
Fryer said he'd go after
the rest of Five-0

27:14.663 --> 27:16.264
with IA investigations
if I didn't cooperate.

27:16.331 --> 27:18.499
And you thought
you had to protect us?

27:18.551 --> 27:19.651
Yeah!

27:19.719 --> 27:21.002
Well, protecting us
wasn't your call.

27:21.053 --> 27:22.771
- It's my badge!
- We should've had a voice in it.

27:22.838 --> 27:26.358
Right. Just like you gave Uncle
a voice in it when you decided

27:26.442 --> 27:28.143
to take the fall
for the money

27:28.194 --> 27:29.611
he stole from the
forfeiture locker.

27:29.678 --> 27:33.114
Must run in the family.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.950
IA's been running an undercover
operation on

27:36.018 --> 27:37.869
a ring of dirty ex-cops.

27:37.953 --> 27:39.520
They shake drug dealers,
arms dealers,

27:39.572 --> 27:40.354
human traffickers

27:40.406 --> 27:42.040
all over the island.

27:42.108 --> 27:43.658
They've dropped dozens
of bodies,

27:43.709 --> 27:44.909
including Brian Scartelli's,

27:44.994 --> 27:47.379
your dead
volleyball coach.

27:47.463 --> 27:49.047
And Karl Joyner, huh?

27:49.131 --> 27:51.466
That's who he was
laundering money for.

27:51.533 --> 27:53.385
Why would you
not loop us in on it?

27:53.469 --> 27:56.704
I couldn't risk it.
You understand that.

27:56.756 --> 27:58.339
These guys still
have contacts inside HPD.

27:58.391 --> 28:00.642
I've been circling Delano's
organization for three years.

28:00.709 --> 28:03.061
Now, Kono
was just making inroads.

28:03.145 --> 28:04.846
She's as close
as we ever gotten.

28:04.897 --> 28:06.731
We had something on
this guy Dwight Murphy.

28:06.816 --> 28:09.317
Could've maybe leveraged that to
get him to flip on Delano,

28:09.384 --> 28:10.718
but thanks to you guys,

28:10.770 --> 28:12.103
Dwight Murphy's
in the morgue

28:12.188 --> 28:13.888
courtesy of a Five-0
bullet.

28:13.939 --> 28:16.057
They're looking for a woman
named Trisha Joyner.

28:16.108 --> 28:17.659
Yeah, I know.
We're looking for her, too.

28:17.726 --> 28:19.393
Well, Delano says
that she has his money.

28:19.445 --> 28:21.029
If he gets to her first,
she's dead.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.447
I have to go back.

28:22.531 --> 28:24.916
No! You're already in too deep
and it's too dangerous!

28:25.000 --> 28:28.402
It's the only way
to get to Trisha.

28:28.454 --> 28:30.705
Look, I don't like what he did.

28:30.756 --> 28:32.406
But I understand why Fryer
targeted me.

28:32.458 --> 28:34.175
You don't understand!

28:34.243 --> 28:36.044
Do you know who Frank Delano's
partner was

28:36.095 --> 28:37.429
when he was on the job?

28:37.513 --> 28:38.763
Do you know?!

28:38.848 --> 28:40.131
It was Fryer!

28:42.351 --> 28:44.769
Delano almost took
Fryer down with him

28:44.854 --> 28:46.805
when he lost his badge.

28:46.889 --> 28:48.189
Don't you get it?

28:48.257 --> 28:49.607
Fryer's using you!

28:49.692 --> 28:52.444
He's using you
to get revenge.

28:54.313 --> 28:56.364
That's true?
Delano was your partner?

28:57.652 --> 28:59.119
You're going after
your ex-partner?

29:01.739 --> 29:05.709
My history with Delano has
nothing to do with this.

29:05.793 --> 29:08.245
This isn't about going after
bad guys, okay?

29:08.312 --> 29:10.530
It's about you getting
even, right? Huh? You put

29:10.581 --> 29:12.699
Kono's life in danger
to settle a personal score.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.751
Not just Kono's life,
the life of an

29:14.835 --> 29:16.219
innocent civilian
who's still out there.

29:16.304 --> 29:18.421
And that's exactly why Kono has
to go back in. Without her,

29:18.506 --> 29:20.340
we've got
nothing on Delano and no way

29:20.391 --> 29:23.260
to find Trisha Joyner.
There's gotta be another way.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.645
- It doesn't have to be Kono.
- Yes, it does.

29:25.713 --> 29:27.564
Why does it have
to be Kono?

29:27.648 --> 29:30.183
It does because the only reason
that Delano let Kono

29:30.234 --> 29:33.103
near his organization is because
she came out of Five-0.

29:33.187 --> 29:34.938
Now everybody on this island
knows, McGarrett,

29:35.022 --> 29:37.073
you play it fast
and loose.

29:37.158 --> 29:39.693
She was an easy sell that she was dirty.
You looking to blame someone

29:39.744 --> 29:41.611
for why Kono's in danger
just look in the mirror.

29:41.696 --> 29:44.247
What'd you do, Fryer, huh?
What'd you do to coerce

29:44.332 --> 29:45.749
Kono to come
and work for you?

29:45.833 --> 29:47.250
Did you tell her
you'd come after me?

29:47.335 --> 29:49.369
Come after Chin Ho?
What'd you do?

29:49.420 --> 29:50.420
When did you stop believing
the ends justify the means?

29:50.504 --> 29:52.622
I use what I have Just like you.

29:52.707 --> 29:55.041
I'm a cop, she's a cop!
She's a year

29:55.092 --> 29:57.711
and a half out of the Academy,
you got her driving

29:57.762 --> 30:01.381
around town with a dead killer
in the car!

30:01.432 --> 30:03.133
We opened fire on her today.

30:03.217 --> 30:04.301
Could've killed her.

30:04.385 --> 30:06.553
I would never do that.

30:06.604 --> 30:08.188
You underestimate yourself
and Kono.

30:08.255 --> 30:10.557
It's Delano.

30:10.608 --> 30:11.641
Don't answer it.
Answer it!

30:11.726 --> 30:13.059
Listen to me. You don't have

30:13.110 --> 30:14.227
to do this anymore, Kono.

30:14.278 --> 30:15.445
If she doesn't
answer it

30:15.529 --> 30:17.814
my entire investigation
is blown. Three years.

30:17.898 --> 30:19.649
I have to.

30:19.734 --> 30:21.768
Trisha Joyner's life
depends on it.

30:23.788 --> 30:26.439
If she goes in, Five-0 goes in
to back her up.

30:26.490 --> 30:28.825
Done. Answer the phone.

30:28.909 --> 30:31.110
Frank.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.746
Yeah, I took care of it.

30:32.797 --> 30:34.781
I'm on my way back.

30:42.723 --> 30:45.642
Fryer , I want to be able
to track her real time, huh?

30:45.726 --> 30:49.093
Delano's an ex-cop, he'll spot a
tail a mile off. And no wire.

30:49.146 --> 30:51.555
First thing he'll do is
I pat me down when I get back.

30:51.556 --> 30:52.481
He doesn't trust me.

30:52.483 --> 30:55.101
Kono's right.
The only reason

30:55.152 --> 30:57.687
he's pulling her onto his crew
now is he's down a man.

30:57.772 --> 30:59.322
I'll get you a message
as soon as I can.

30:59.407 --> 31:01.324
It's not gonna be
that easy, okay?

31:01.409 --> 31:02.475
Delano's not gonna leave
you alone.

31:02.526 --> 31:03.526
I'll figure it out.

31:04.912 --> 31:07.664
All right,
we're gonna be in a van,

31:07.748 --> 31:09.616
ready to move on
your word.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.669
All right. I couldn't ask
for better back-up.

31:20.928 --> 31:22.178
Where have you been?

31:22.263 --> 31:23.880
Seriously?

31:23.964 --> 31:27.384
What he means is
what took you so long?

31:27.468 --> 31:28.802
I've been cleaning up your mess,

31:28.853 --> 31:30.503
that's where I've been.

31:30.554 --> 31:33.890
Which one of you two
wanted Dwight dead?

31:33.974 --> 31:35.341
What the hell?

31:35.393 --> 31:37.394
Dwight and me walked into
an ambush at that motel.

31:37.478 --> 31:38.511
Somebody tipped off HPD.

31:38.562 --> 31:40.397
I want to know which one
of you did it.

31:40.481 --> 31:43.116
Well, seems like you got away
without a scratch, huh?

31:43.183 --> 31:45.368
How do we know it wasn't
you who dropped Dwight.

31:45.453 --> 31:47.871
I just dumped his body off
a bridge 'cause somebody

31:47.955 --> 31:50.040
screwed up! Now is not the time
to mess with me!

31:50.124 --> 31:52.859
You ran into some bad luck,
that's all.

31:52.910 --> 31:54.127
Too bad about Dwight,

31:54.194 --> 31:56.362
but there's nothing
we can do about it now.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.882
You need to stay focused on what
matters most, right?

31:58.966 --> 32:00.550
Finding Trisha Joyner.

32:00.634 --> 32:02.252
She's the one who has
your money?

32:02.336 --> 32:05.004
We have
an unfortunate situation here.

32:05.056 --> 32:08.058
It seems Mrs.
Joyner emptied

32:08.142 --> 32:10.927
her husband's bank account
before she ran out on him.

32:11.011 --> 32:11.928
Minor detail:

32:12.012 --> 32:13.680
the money not his,
it's ours.

32:13.731 --> 32:15.548
All right, so Trisha Joyner's in
the wind.

32:15.599 --> 32:16.766
How do we find her?

32:16.851 --> 32:19.218
We don't.
She's gonna come to us.

32:19.270 --> 32:22.722
Turns out she confided in
the volleyball coach.

32:22.773 --> 32:24.174
He helped her
leave her husband.

32:24.241 --> 32:27.994
She's on the run,
but she trusts him.

32:28.061 --> 32:29.913
Minor detail:
the volleyball coach is dead.

32:29.997 --> 32:31.247
His cell phone isn't.

32:31.332 --> 32:33.733
Dwight grabbed it the night
he took care of the guy.

32:33.784 --> 32:36.736
I sent Mrs. Joyner a text
from this cell phone.

32:36.787 --> 32:38.621
telling her her husband knows
where he is.

32:38.706 --> 32:40.023
I booked her a room

32:40.091 --> 32:41.591
in the Aston Waikiki.

32:41.675 --> 32:44.243
Mrs. Joyner's gonna text us
when she checks in.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.795
What if she knows
he's already dead?

32:45.880 --> 32:48.748
She's on the run.
She's not buying newspapers

32:48.799 --> 32:50.133
and watching the news.

32:50.217 --> 32:51.634
As long as we move fast,

32:51.719 --> 32:53.386
we'll be fine.

32:54.889 --> 32:56.222
How do you like that.

32:56.273 --> 32:58.224
She's there.

32:58.275 --> 33:00.977
Room 2127.

33:20.113 --> 33:22.165
...the chain of craters

33:22.233 --> 33:27.504
A lot of the smoke is not
related to the volcano.

33:27.588 --> 33:30.773
Well, thanks. Well,
police tonight still searching

33:30.841 --> 33:34.777
for a suspect in the brutal
murder of Brian Scartelli.

33:45.156 --> 33:48.858
Mrs. Joyner,
nice to finally meet you.

33:57.903 --> 33:59.304
Kono's been out for
almost two hours.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.256
I don't like it.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.591
She'll make the call.

34:02.675 --> 34:04.092
Should have tailed her.

34:12.318 --> 34:13.902
What are we doing?

34:13.985 --> 34:17.322
Trying to activate the
microphone on Kono's cell phone.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.774
If I can get it,
it will work like a wire.

34:19.859 --> 34:21.826
Can you do that?
We'll see.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.079
If I can remotely
download this spyware

34:24.103 --> 34:25.304
onto her phone's O.S.,

34:25.364 --> 34:28.065
I might be able to access it
and pick up an audio signal.

34:28.117 --> 34:30.234
This better be worth it,
you understand?

34:30.286 --> 34:31.453
It will be.

34:31.536 --> 34:33.888
Look, right now,
the money's the only thing

34:33.956 --> 34:35.239
that ties Delano to the murders.

34:35.291 --> 34:37.592
We catch him with the
money, he goes away for life.

34:37.677 --> 34:39.761
I'm getting audio.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.096
It's staticky,
but I'm getting something.

34:41.179 --> 34:43.931
Let me see if I can
clear it up.

34:44.016 --> 34:45.433
The thing is...

34:47.418 --> 34:50.105
you have something
that belongs to me.

34:50.188 --> 34:52.607
No. No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:52.692 --> 34:53.942
Your husband was holding
some money

34:54.025 --> 34:55.360
in his bank account for me.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.929
I believe
you took it.

34:57.980 --> 34:59.698
Oh God.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.599
I-I didn't know.

35:04.904 --> 35:07.138
You killed Brian.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.444
Where's Karl?

35:15.331 --> 35:16.881
Oh God.

35:20.369 --> 35:22.303
I'm getting a clear signal.

35:24.056 --> 35:26.675
They're on the move.

35:26.759 --> 35:28.343
They've got Trisha Joyner

35:28.427 --> 35:30.295
Bank of O'ahu account
five blocks down.

35:30.363 --> 35:32.847
They're heading to a Bank of O'ahu.
Which branch?

35:32.932 --> 35:34.516
We can't go in guns blazing.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.185
We don't want to provoke
a hostage situation.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.469
He's right.

35:38.521 --> 35:40.739
We wait until Delano
and his crew exit the bank

35:40.806 --> 35:42.691
with the money.
That's where we take them down.

35:42.775 --> 35:45.577
Got it. The location's
at Hunewai and Lakeside.

35:57.373 --> 35:59.841
Where are
the safe deposit boxes?

35:59.909 --> 36:02.477
They're downstairs.
We have to take the elevator.

36:35.377 --> 36:37.912
Delano's got an eye
on the street.

36:37.997 --> 36:39.547
Guy's armed and he's wired

36:39.632 --> 36:42.700
for communication
with the crew inside.

36:49.175 --> 36:50.809
Maintain situational awareness,

36:50.876 --> 36:52.794
stay barricaded,
and hold your perimeter.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.973
My friend needs to get
into her safe deposit box.

37:05.040 --> 37:08.059
Sure, I just need
to see your key.

37:08.110 --> 37:10.361
It's in your purse, remember?

37:11.347 --> 37:12.781
Right.

37:24.827 --> 37:26.661
Ma'am, you can have
a seat out here.

37:26.729 --> 37:29.297
Oh, but Trisha wanted me
to go in with her.

37:30.583 --> 37:33.417
Yes. I want my friend
to come in.

37:51.887 --> 37:54.055
It's this one
right here.

38:04.466 --> 38:06.284
Thank you.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.207
I got it.

38:24.153 --> 38:25.937
Come on.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.410
No, I can't. I can't.

38:32.477 --> 38:34.412
Hey, hey, listen to me,
listen to me.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.247
I'm an undercover cop.

38:36.315 --> 38:40.835
Do everything I tell you to do
and you'll get out of this.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.253
I promise.

38:42.321 --> 38:44.973
Okay, now let's go.

39:10.099 --> 39:11.783
The guy on the street's
getting curious.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.517
He's taking a walk, guys.

39:13.569 --> 39:16.120
He's taking a walk.
There's so many patrols on the street

39:16.188 --> 39:18.539
There's no way to pull them back
before he sees them.

39:18.624 --> 39:20.625
We've got 20 yards
before he hits the corner.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.744
If he senses heat, we've got
a bank full of hostages.

39:22.811 --> 39:24.579
Hold your positions.
do not engage.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.798
Do not engage.

39:56.195 --> 39:58.279
Ma'am, you forgot your key.

39:58.364 --> 39:59.998
Give it to me now.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.844
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't touch that alarm, damn it!

40:12.911 --> 40:15.263
Frank, don't do it.
Get your hands up, hear me?

40:15.347 --> 40:17.532
Let's see 'em.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.893
Come on, let's go! In here!

40:35.217 --> 40:37.402
Let's go.

40:37.453 --> 40:38.602
Move it.

40:49.164 --> 40:51.716
Hold your fire!
He has a hostage!

41:20.462 --> 41:21.412
Let her go, Frank.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.081
You gonna shoot me, Vince?

41:23.148 --> 41:24.148
Let her go.

41:24.199 --> 41:25.867
I know you don't
want to do this.

41:25.951 --> 41:28.169
You think I won't do it?

41:28.237 --> 41:30.121
You think I won't?

42:29.848 --> 42:31.015
Hey, Fryer.

42:31.066 --> 42:32.767
Yeah?

42:32.851 --> 42:34.635
Listen...

42:39.074 --> 42:42.560
Nobody messes with
my team, all right?

42:45.730 --> 42:47.915
Duly noted, Commander.

42:57.709 --> 42:59.844
Let's go home.
