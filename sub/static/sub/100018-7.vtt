00:21.492 --> 00:22.792
[Dick] <i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:22.827 --> 00:23.827
<i>What am I?</i>

00:23.827 --> 00:27.196
You were the genetic material
of two different people
blended together.

00:27.198 --> 00:29.000
-Lex Luthor.
-And who else?

00:29.033 --> 00:30.300
[chuckling] Superman.

00:30.301 --> 00:31.602
[Conner] <i>If they get me,
what will they do to me?</i>

00:31.603 --> 00:33.204
[Mercy]
We're doing it my way.

00:33.237 --> 00:34.771
-I don't wanna leave you.
-Go.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.000
<i>Don't use your powers.</i>

00:36.000 --> 00:37.408
<i>Don't be a hero.</i>

00:37.442 --> 00:39.743
If I'm Robin... who are you?

00:39.777 --> 00:41.045
That's a good question.

00:41.078 --> 00:43.314
His name is Deathstroke.
Old Titans business.

00:43.347 --> 00:44.348
That's Rose's father?

00:44.381 --> 00:46.482
He killed my brother.

00:46.517 --> 00:47.719
I'm Dick.

00:47.752 --> 00:49.353
[Rose] <i>He said big brother
fell in with the wrong crowd.</i>

00:49.353 --> 00:50.854
[Dick] <i>I'm training them to be
a better version of us.</i>

00:50.856 --> 00:52.923
[Donna] <i>But there's
ghosts in this place.</i>

00:52.923 --> 00:57.393
<i>Do they even know
what happened last time?</i>

00:57.426 --> 00:58.496
Garth!

00:58.530 --> 01:00.430
[Dawn]
<i>Reopening this tower
was a mistake.</i>

01:00.465 --> 01:03.301
How many people have to die
for you to realize that?

01:03.335 --> 01:06.870
[Dick] <i>If you want
revenge for what happened,
you can have me.</i>

01:06.903 --> 01:08.171
Say goodbye to your friend.

01:08.206 --> 01:09.706
[Dick] No!

01:13.778 --> 01:15.712
[Jason] I don't know
how to thank you.

01:15.745 --> 01:17.515
[gunshots]

01:17.549 --> 01:19.082
This guy just saved my life.

01:19.115 --> 01:23.087
[coughing]

01:23.120 --> 01:26.623
[Jason screaming]

01:26.656 --> 01:27.656
No!

01:34.298 --> 01:37.447
[continues screaming]

02:07.265 --> 02:10.769
[Bruce] They say the suit
makes the man.

02:10.801 --> 02:13.836
In your case,
I guess it would be

02:13.871 --> 02:15.606
a memorial urn.

02:15.639 --> 02:20.639
A whole life reduced to
a decorative can of ash.

02:21.245 --> 02:23.114
But you're
not sentimental, are you?

02:23.146 --> 02:25.300
[scoffs] When you
walk away from a job,

02:25.300 --> 02:27.084
you really walk away.

02:27.117 --> 02:28.118
Let things go.

02:28.151 --> 02:31.602
Let, ooh, people... go.

02:37.594 --> 02:42.594
I guess you figured
one less Robin in the world
wouldn't hurt.

02:43.599 --> 02:45.635
Or maybe you had
another idea.

02:45.669 --> 02:47.906
Let me guess.

02:47.938 --> 02:52.575
You were gonna trade
your life for Jason's.

02:52.609 --> 02:54.812
Noble.

02:54.844 --> 02:56.212
And fucking stupid.

02:56.212 --> 02:57.580
You thought
Deathstroke wanted you?

02:57.581 --> 03:01.318
Guess what, precious,
he wants everybody but you.

03:01.352 --> 03:03.888
At least for now.

03:03.921 --> 03:07.123
You were supposed to
protect these kids.

03:07.157 --> 03:09.092
That's why I sent
Jason to you.

03:09.126 --> 03:11.262
You were supposed
to make him right.

03:11.294 --> 03:14.298
Instead you hurt him,
you ostracized him,

03:14.331 --> 03:16.334
humiliated him.

03:16.366 --> 03:18.301
You lied to him.

03:18.336 --> 03:21.239
Not the florid lies
you told in grade school.

03:21.271 --> 03:24.442
This was, uh, more insidious.

03:24.474 --> 03:27.812
A lie of omission.

03:27.846 --> 03:31.382
This blood feud
between you
and Deathstroke...

03:31.415 --> 03:35.919
You just let Jason walk
right into the middle of it.

03:35.953 --> 03:38.522
[whispers] Psst. Hey.

03:38.522 --> 03:41.522
You know what this
is really about?

03:43.794 --> 03:45.593
[Dawn] Dick?

03:48.932 --> 03:52.336
You okay?

03:52.370 --> 03:53.669
Yeah.

03:53.669 --> 03:57.542
Well, I can't say the same
about the kid
who saved Jason.

03:57.574 --> 03:58.742
I thought you
patched him up?

03:58.776 --> 04:01.979
I did the best I could,
considering, but...

04:01.979 --> 04:04.314
there are complications.

04:04.314 --> 04:09.264
You might wanna come
take a look.

04:14.191 --> 04:17.341
[theme music playing]

04:29.206 --> 04:33.105
[monitor beeping steadily]

04:36.346 --> 04:38.149
Is he stable?

04:38.182 --> 04:39.449
For the moment.

04:39.449 --> 04:41.285
Whatever they shot him with
left something behind.

04:41.285 --> 04:43.021
Some sort of toxin.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.588
Maybe we should
take him to a hospital.

04:44.588 --> 04:45.923
[Bruce] Genius.

04:45.923 --> 04:48.391
A nice, quiet place
where they can
finish him off.

04:48.425 --> 04:49.761
The boy has
special abilities.

04:49.793 --> 04:52.295
Yeah, I think
he's safest here.

04:52.329 --> 04:53.430
Okay.

04:53.463 --> 04:55.199
[Dawn] And I think
you should call Bruce.

04:55.233 --> 04:58.369
He catalogues these things.
He might know who he is.

04:58.401 --> 05:01.172
Hello? Hey, Dick.

05:01.204 --> 05:02.607
Oh, sure.
I can look the kid up.

05:02.639 --> 05:05.110
Hey, I just realized
what your special skill is.

05:05.142 --> 05:08.713
The thing that makes you
the natural leader in this group.

05:08.745 --> 05:11.516
You're the only one
with my phone number.

05:11.548 --> 05:14.786
[Kory] Dick?

05:14.819 --> 05:16.586
-I'll call Bruce.
-[Dawn] Good.

05:16.586 --> 05:19.156
You check on Jason?

05:19.189 --> 05:20.689
On my way.

05:24.595 --> 05:29.595
-[heavy metal music blaring]
-[grunting]

05:37.141 --> 05:39.175
-You all right?
-All good.

05:39.209 --> 05:40.577
[Bruce] Of course
he's all right.

05:40.610 --> 05:44.211
Fifteen storeys of
free-falling probably
did him good.

05:46.283 --> 05:48.653
It's past midnight.
You should probably
take it easy.

05:48.685 --> 05:51.255
I don't wanna take it easy.
I feel good.

05:51.288 --> 05:54.759
More people should drop
their problem children
off buildings.

05:54.791 --> 05:58.428
It clarifies
the mind and body.

05:58.461 --> 06:01.197
[grunting]

06:01.232 --> 06:03.132
That was quite the fall
you took.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.502
Yeah, it was hellacious.

06:04.535 --> 06:07.137
How did it look
from your angle?

06:07.170 --> 06:08.204
Scary.

06:08.238 --> 06:11.238
Well, good thing
Conner was there.

06:13.310 --> 06:15.211
I'm sorry.

06:15.245 --> 06:16.514
That should do it.

06:16.547 --> 06:21.547
"Sorry" always makes
things right.

06:21.651 --> 06:24.088
-[panting]
-Ah.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.389
Rest will fix him.

06:26.423 --> 06:27.625
And a team of shrinks.

06:27.658 --> 06:28.860
Maybe some meds.

06:28.892 --> 06:32.028
Uppers, downers,
in-betweens.

06:32.062 --> 06:35.333
Kid'll be right as rain.

06:35.334 --> 06:36.533
Are you sure you're all right?

06:36.533 --> 06:38.000
[Jason] Cut the crap.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.971
Okay, why don't you say
what you really
wanna say, huh?

06:40.004 --> 06:44.841
That all this is
my fucking fault for
going out there alone.

06:44.875 --> 06:46.242
No.

06:46.276 --> 06:48.812
I don't think that.

06:48.846 --> 06:52.850
A master of understatement.

06:52.882 --> 06:54.050
Rest up.

06:54.052 --> 06:55.052
Well done.

06:55.052 --> 06:59.853
You can check that
off the list.

07:03.761 --> 07:06.396
What's with
the Houdini act?

07:06.430 --> 07:08.533
-What?
-Out there with Deathstroke.

07:08.565 --> 07:10.300
You disappear
and leave us in the dark?

07:10.334 --> 07:11.802
"Houdini" is flattering.

07:11.836 --> 07:14.672
Houdini was not suicidal.

07:14.706 --> 07:16.007
There's no egg fried rice.

07:16.040 --> 07:18.309
[Dawn] You go off
by yourself with
nobody to trade?

07:18.341 --> 07:20.144
-No backup?
-Can we not do this now?

07:20.177 --> 07:23.279
Now is working for me.

07:23.314 --> 07:25.315
[sighs] I fucked up.

07:25.348 --> 07:27.851
[both] No shit.

07:27.886 --> 07:31.723
Is there...
Is there something
you're not telling us?

07:31.755 --> 07:33.690
The bastard's clever, too.

07:33.725 --> 07:35.360
No wonder Dawn
made the trade.

07:35.394 --> 07:39.163
I always imagined it was
a lateral move,
but now I see it's an upgrade.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.064
Something to do
with Deathstroke, maybe?

07:41.098 --> 07:42.264
There's nothing.

07:42.266 --> 07:43.567
It was just a tactical error.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.302
Military-speak for when
you're bald-faced lying.

07:46.336 --> 07:47.437
You take note, kids.

07:47.471 --> 07:48.471
I'll take care of it.

07:48.505 --> 07:49.740
Everything else
has gone so well.

07:49.740 --> 07:51.341
-Where are you going?
-I'll be back later.

07:51.343 --> 07:53.610
People were
just shooting at us,
and you're gonna go out?

07:53.644 --> 07:55.699
There's nothing to
worry about, kids.

07:55.713 --> 07:57.749
Just a mild psychic split.

07:57.781 --> 08:00.317
Anybody need anything?
Milk, eggs?

08:00.350 --> 08:01.850
Body bags?

08:06.357 --> 08:07.557
[liquid pouring]

08:07.591 --> 08:09.726
[Kory humming softly]

08:09.761 --> 08:13.661
[monitor beeping steadily]

08:19.470 --> 08:23.670
[speaking in alien language]

08:25.675 --> 08:27.577
[Dawn] Kory.

08:27.612 --> 08:30.548
[Kory] Gosh!

08:30.548 --> 08:31.548
What did you say?

08:31.548 --> 08:33.082
"Let go of my damn arm."

08:33.116 --> 08:34.485
He's from Tamaran?

08:34.518 --> 08:39.518
No. Kryptonian.
It's a dead language.

08:40.924 --> 08:44.162
Which also explains this IV.

08:44.195 --> 08:47.230
I couldn't get it in.
His skin is completely
impenetrable.

08:47.264 --> 08:50.563
[mumbles indistinctly]

08:53.703 --> 08:55.405
He's saying "Eve."

08:55.438 --> 08:58.438
Who the hell is Eve?

09:11.089 --> 09:15.458
I'm thinking of teaching
him to do a new trick.

09:15.493 --> 09:16.927
How about play dead?

09:16.961 --> 09:19.129
-Where is he?
-Subject 13?

09:19.163 --> 09:21.365
It's dead.

09:21.398 --> 09:24.201
Mmm. Almost dead.

09:24.235 --> 09:26.537
I suppose by now,
the kryptonite should
have done its job.

09:26.570 --> 09:28.673
What... You don't have him?

09:28.706 --> 09:31.408
Luthor considers it
another write-off.

09:31.442 --> 09:32.844
On to Subject 14.

09:32.876 --> 09:35.245
You just... left him to die?

09:35.245 --> 09:38.282
If you'd just
brought it back to us
as instructed,

09:38.283 --> 09:39.783
all of this could have
been avoided.

09:39.783 --> 09:41.485
Assemble another team.
Bring him back here.

09:41.485 --> 09:43.486
If I just have another
couple of hours with him
in the lab--

09:43.486 --> 09:44.554
It's over.

09:44.587 --> 09:47.224
Subject 13 has
been terminated.

09:47.256 --> 09:49.159
And so have you.

09:49.193 --> 09:52.897
Mr. Luthor wants you
off the premises
within the hour.

09:52.929 --> 09:56.980
Let's have your party pass.

10:00.672 --> 10:05.208
Have you considered
that this might all be
for the best?

10:05.241 --> 10:07.544
No, Mercy, I haven't.

10:07.577 --> 10:08.879
Think about it.

10:08.913 --> 10:11.514
A thing made from
even a little of
Lex Luthor's DNA?

10:11.548 --> 10:13.650
That's super.

10:13.683 --> 10:15.852
Have you met our boss?

10:15.886 --> 10:18.822
There's no good end
to that story.

10:18.855 --> 10:21.491
The world's better off
without it.

10:21.524 --> 10:24.227
Conner.

10:24.260 --> 10:25.363
What?

10:25.397 --> 10:30.397
He's a person.
He has a name.
His name is Conner.

10:34.172 --> 10:36.140
[man] I swear to God,
bald is sexy.

10:36.173 --> 10:38.509
You will literally do
anything for a promotion,
won't you?

10:38.542 --> 10:39.543
Why so judgy?

10:39.576 --> 10:41.211
Oh, my God!

10:41.245 --> 10:43.195
I'm so sorry.

10:48.719 --> 10:51.755
[blues music playing]

10:51.788 --> 10:53.890
[door opens]

10:53.924 --> 10:57.375
[door closes and locks]

10:59.395 --> 11:01.899
Dick Grayson.

11:01.932 --> 11:03.133
Back from the abyss.

11:03.167 --> 11:04.368
Hi, Benny.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.503
Heard you were in Detroit.

11:05.535 --> 11:07.172
What's it been...
six, seven years?

11:07.205 --> 11:09.173
-Five years.
-I can't remember.

11:09.206 --> 11:11.842
It's been five years.
You remember it perfectly.

11:11.875 --> 11:13.043
I need information.

11:13.076 --> 11:14.846
Oh, I don't do that
anymore, man.

11:14.879 --> 11:17.480
No weapons,
no hook-ups, no cop-talk.

11:17.514 --> 11:19.918
What's that on your waist?

11:19.951 --> 11:23.120
Well, the rest of
the neighborhood hasn't got
the memo, that's all.

11:23.120 --> 11:24.522
I'm looking for a shooter.

11:24.554 --> 11:27.191
Guy by the name
of Slade Wilson.

11:27.224 --> 11:28.527
[exclaims]

11:28.559 --> 11:32.364
The last time I saw Slade
was down at
the Peninsula gun range.

11:32.397 --> 11:35.700
[Bruce] How desperate you are
to cauterize
your little secret, huh?

11:35.732 --> 11:37.802
Hide your little boo-boo.

11:37.835 --> 11:39.903
It's too bad Alfred
isn't here to fix it.

11:39.937 --> 11:42.105
[imitating Alfred]
"Oh, somebody has
a nasty splinter.

11:42.139 --> 11:44.975
I'm sorry,
Master Grayson, but that's
going to have to come out.

11:44.975 --> 11:46.211
Let me get the tweezers."

11:46.244 --> 11:48.111
Sprinkles.
Just how you like 'em.

11:48.145 --> 11:49.613
Slade doesn't do gun ranges.

11:49.647 --> 11:50.914
Don't lie to me, Benny.

11:50.947 --> 11:52.884
Why don't you
stick his head
in the deep fryer?

11:52.917 --> 11:54.219
Smash his head
in the counter?

11:54.251 --> 11:56.821
I mean, in for a penny,
in for a pound

11:56.854 --> 11:58.154
Shut the fuck up.

11:58.187 --> 12:02.292
He speaks.

12:02.326 --> 12:04.895
Talk to me.

12:04.928 --> 12:08.566
Look, Slade retired maybe
six or seven years ago.

12:08.566 --> 12:09.567
Five years ago.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.235
Why does nobody
remember that?

12:11.269 --> 12:12.870
What about his handler,
Wintergreen?

12:12.903 --> 12:14.504
[Benny] I don't know.

12:14.538 --> 12:16.374
[groans in pain]
Come on, man.

12:16.408 --> 12:18.942
-You happy?
-Now you're cooking, baby.

12:18.975 --> 12:21.144
[grunts] Okay, okay!

12:21.144 --> 12:22.144
[panting]

12:22.145 --> 12:24.981
He dates these sisters, twins.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.418
He used to anyway.
One of them OD'd.

12:26.418 --> 12:28.186
But the other one
runs the Scarlet Rose
on Harbor.

12:28.219 --> 12:30.320
-What's her name?
-Mati.

12:30.354 --> 12:32.456
Mati Matisse.

12:32.489 --> 12:33.657
[both] Sounds made up.

12:33.691 --> 12:37.660
Because it is!

12:37.695 --> 12:38.895
I'm keeping this.

12:38.929 --> 12:39.996
Hey, no guns.

12:40.030 --> 12:43.533
Deathstroke's a gun guy.

12:43.567 --> 12:45.269
Thanks, Benny.

12:45.302 --> 12:47.837
[door opens]

12:47.871 --> 12:49.822
[door closes]

13:00.551 --> 13:03.153
What the fuck?

13:03.187 --> 13:06.389
[heavy metal music playing]

13:06.423 --> 13:09.359
[Dick] <i>Jason!</i>

13:09.393 --> 13:10.561

[music continues]

13:15.700 --> 13:18.769
[turns off music]

13:18.802 --> 13:21.105
What the fuck
are you listening to?

13:21.139 --> 13:24.173
-Can I come in?
-No.

13:24.207 --> 13:26.442
Wow.

13:26.476 --> 13:27.644
What?

13:27.677 --> 13:29.779
I know the look.

13:29.813 --> 13:30.846
He did a number on you.

13:30.847 --> 13:32.182
You can leave now.

13:32.216 --> 13:33.418
Really?

13:33.451 --> 13:35.519
You made it out alive
from my dad.
I thought you'd be--

13:35.552 --> 13:38.890
-What?
-Tougher.

13:38.923 --> 13:42.059
You know, your friends act
like you're some kind of fuck-up.

13:42.092 --> 13:44.961
But you're the only one
actually doing anything.

13:44.995 --> 13:47.365
The rest of them
just argue
with each other.

13:47.365 --> 13:49.667
You tried to
stop my father.
They didn't do shit.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.101
Dick did what he could.

13:51.134 --> 13:52.970
Really? 'Cause I heard
he dropped you
from a skyscraper.

13:53.004 --> 13:56.303
-Not his fault.
-Not yours either.

13:58.509 --> 14:01.513
You got any music
with an actual beat?

14:01.546 --> 14:03.748
-Look, I don't want to
be an asshole.
-Then don't.

14:03.780 --> 14:05.682
I know my dad
tried to kill you.

14:05.716 --> 14:07.351
Your friends
tried to kill me.

14:07.384 --> 14:11.755
And that was after
they tried to trade me
for Deathstroke.

14:11.755 --> 14:16.126
So call us even.

14:16.159 --> 14:19.097
God, what is up
with everyone here
anyways?

14:19.130 --> 14:23.033
You people need some kind
of super shrink to deal
with all your problems.

14:23.067 --> 14:26.636
[chuckles] That would mean
talking about them.

14:26.669 --> 14:29.707
Not our strong suit.

14:29.740 --> 14:34.711
You're the only person
worth talking to
in this place.

14:34.745 --> 14:36.580
You're still out
of your mind.

14:36.614 --> 14:40.551
But... I understand it.

14:40.583 --> 14:42.251
Did you...

14:42.253 --> 14:44.556
Did you just say
something nice in that?

14:44.589 --> 14:47.191
I'm pretty sure you said
something nice.

14:47.225 --> 14:49.860
Don't make it weird.

14:49.894 --> 14:51.761
So...

14:51.796 --> 14:54.498
Kicking me out?

14:54.498 --> 14:55.498
I was trying to.

14:55.500 --> 15:00.004
But now, you wanna see
where this is going.

15:00.037 --> 15:02.272
Admit it.

15:02.306 --> 15:05.375
So do I.

15:05.409 --> 15:09.013
So how about
I DJ for a bit?

15:09.046 --> 15:10.546
Up to you.

15:17.788 --> 15:21.988
Just don't scratch my vinyl.

[keypad beeping]

15:35.206 --> 15:38.505
[lock buzzes, unlocks]

15:47.552 --> 15:52.552
Okay, boy. I need you
to help me find him.

16:01.566 --> 16:04.934
Come on, boy.
Let's make this fast.

16:04.969 --> 16:06.937
Fuck! Fuck, fuck!

16:06.971 --> 16:10.207
Okay. I'm gonna need
your help with this.

16:10.240 --> 16:13.009
Do that weird
laser-eye thing
that you do.

16:13.043 --> 16:14.845
Come on, boy.

16:14.879 --> 16:15.946

Yes!

Stay right there, Dr. Watson.

You wanna buy me a drink?

[sultry music playing]

17:12.303 --> 17:17.252
[audience cheering
and whistling]

17:21.045 --> 17:22.545
[Dick] Hi.

17:33.089 --> 17:34.859
You're at the wrong table,
Creamsicle.

17:34.893 --> 17:37.493
-This one's mine.
-I was hoping we could share.

17:37.528 --> 17:39.297
Tempting.

17:39.329 --> 17:41.832
But I'm not in the mood.

17:41.865 --> 17:45.102
[audience cheering]

17:45.135 --> 17:48.806
I think we could be friends.

17:48.838 --> 17:51.075
Friends need a reason.

17:51.107 --> 17:52.643
A common goal.

17:52.675 --> 17:55.712
Or a condition.

17:55.746 --> 17:58.082
Or a common enemy.

17:58.115 --> 18:01.184
I'm sorry about your sister.

18:01.219 --> 18:04.121
You knew Christy?

18:04.154 --> 18:07.592
But I know Wintergreen.

18:07.625 --> 18:10.060
Let's not say that name
tonight.

18:10.094 --> 18:11.528
I heard you were
with him...

18:11.563 --> 18:14.398
-Both of you.
-Makes my skin crawl.

18:14.432 --> 18:16.032
He killed Christy.

18:16.067 --> 18:19.670
Course, she let him.

18:19.702 --> 18:21.471
I need to find him.

18:21.506 --> 18:25.855
[audience cheering raucously]

18:32.616 --> 18:34.951
Come on, Boy Wonder.
This is your show.

18:34.984 --> 18:36.854
The whole night is
about you.

18:36.886 --> 18:38.122
Saving your ass.

18:38.154 --> 18:40.156
Chasing your ghosts.

18:40.191 --> 18:44.362
Let's see what you got.

18:44.394 --> 18:46.563
Amazing, aren't they?

18:46.596 --> 18:47.596
Who?

18:54.439 --> 18:56.374
Look, I need your help.

18:56.406 --> 18:57.508
Why would I do that?

18:57.541 --> 18:59.309
Because once he gives me
what I want,

18:59.343 --> 19:01.278
he'll be gone.

19:01.311 --> 19:04.115
Are you some kind of hero?

19:04.147 --> 19:07.250
Something like that.

19:07.285 --> 19:11.934
My sister would have
liked you.

19:13.423 --> 19:16.093
He's at the Davis Hotel.

19:16.126 --> 19:17.777
Which room?

19:21.932 --> 19:23.132
The top.

19:27.505 --> 19:30.505
[audience clapping, cheering]

19:50.894 --> 19:53.743
[r&b music playing]

20:14.484 --> 20:16.953
Hey! Earth to Major Tom.

20:16.987 --> 20:19.237
Snap out of it.

20:26.798 --> 20:29.200
Batman teach you
how to dance?

20:29.232 --> 20:30.800
I don't dance.

20:30.834 --> 20:31.834
Come on.

20:31.836 --> 20:35.205
Deathstroke messed
with my head, too.

20:35.239 --> 20:40.009
Doesn't mean
you can't dance.

20:40.044 --> 20:44.347
It's just like fighting.

20:44.382 --> 20:47.082
Without the blood.

21:14.111 --> 21:16.079
Ah, fuck.

21:16.113 --> 21:19.083
I'm... I'm sorry.
Don't hit me.

21:19.115 --> 21:21.685
It's a thing that happened.

21:21.719 --> 21:26.719
Don't get stupid about it,
and it might happen again.

21:40.438 --> 21:42.272
What?

21:42.306 --> 21:44.474
The fuck you doing
with my brother's record?

21:44.509 --> 21:46.544
-You have a brother?
-I did.

21:46.576 --> 21:48.412
This is his.
This is his handwriting.

21:48.412 --> 21:49.614
How the fuck
did it get here?

21:49.614 --> 21:51.449
They're Dick's.
I borrowed them.

21:51.449 --> 21:52.915
Okay, maybe he bought
them secondhand.

21:52.915 --> 21:54.084
Bullshit.

21:54.117 --> 21:55.286
You guys playing me?

21:55.318 --> 21:56.554
Well, what am I, bait?

21:56.586 --> 21:58.088
What are you
talking about, Rose?

21:58.123 --> 22:00.991
Don't fucking lie to me.
This is my dead brother's shit.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.326
Did you use him
to get to Deathstroke,

22:02.326 --> 22:03.627
and that's what
you're doing to me--

22:03.627 --> 22:05.829
Rose, calm down, okay.
What are you talking about?

22:05.864 --> 22:08.066
Deathstroke killed
my brother.

22:08.098 --> 22:10.768
Rumor was he fell in
with the wrong crowd,

22:10.801 --> 22:13.037
people who used him
to get to my dad.

22:13.069 --> 22:15.573
Sound familiar?

22:15.605 --> 22:19.276
If this record is here,
then my brother was here.

22:19.309 --> 22:22.046
Dick knew him,
and he never told me.

22:22.078 --> 22:23.513
You know what, fuck him!

22:23.548 --> 22:24.914
Fuck all of you!

22:24.948 --> 22:26.817
Rose!

22:26.849 --> 22:28.219
Rose, wait!

22:28.251 --> 22:29.920
Fuck.

22:29.952 --> 22:33.124
[sighs]

22:33.157 --> 22:38.157
[Bruce]
This doesn't feel right,
and you know it.

22:38.194 --> 22:39.596
What are we
really doing?

22:39.630 --> 22:41.464
Finding Deathstroke.

22:41.499 --> 22:43.267
Then what?

22:43.299 --> 22:44.868
Bury him.

22:44.903 --> 22:46.636
You mean so you can
bury your secret.

22:46.671 --> 22:48.305
You know, we all
played our part.

22:48.338 --> 22:51.838
Yeah. And yours was
a featured role.

23:00.585 --> 23:05.522
[lock beeps]

23:05.556 --> 23:08.705
Hey, get out of here.

23:22.138 --> 23:23.638
Hey, scat.

23:37.488 --> 23:41.157
Where's Slade?

23:41.192 --> 23:43.294
[scoffs]

23:43.326 --> 23:45.395
I'm not sure
which one's crazier,

23:45.429 --> 23:47.902
you or him.

23:59.609 --> 24:04.147
Pretty sure you win, Dick.

24:04.181 --> 24:07.084
Where is he?

24:07.085 --> 24:08.086
You've hit a dead end.

24:08.086 --> 24:10.520
-Next round's
in the stomach.
-I know.

24:10.555 --> 24:13.022
Thing is, I'm a middleman.

24:13.057 --> 24:14.592
A buffer.

24:14.625 --> 24:17.694
Safety zone between
guys like you and Slade.

24:17.729 --> 24:20.164
So kill me if you want...

24:20.198 --> 24:23.467
But I didn't get this job
because I'm personable.

24:23.500 --> 24:28.500
I got this job
because I hold the line.

24:31.576 --> 24:34.310
How long has it been
since that went down
with you and Slade?

24:34.345 --> 24:35.479
Oh, please God.

24:35.512 --> 24:37.582
-Five years?
-Thank you.

24:37.615 --> 24:40.317
[Wintergreen] You crossed
the line, man.

24:40.351 --> 24:42.787
Used the man's family.

24:42.819 --> 24:44.423
-Even I wouldn't do that.
-Dick.

24:44.423 --> 24:45.423
Where the fuck is he?

24:45.423 --> 24:46.924
These guys are
playing you.

24:46.958 --> 24:48.558
You should
get back to the Tower,
back to where you're needed.

24:48.558 --> 24:49.527
Stop.

24:49.527 --> 24:50.728
Stop fucking talking.

24:50.761 --> 24:52.328
Are you all right?

24:52.363 --> 24:55.665
[groans]

24:55.700 --> 24:58.635
You kill him,
then Slade, then who?

24:58.669 --> 25:03.669
Who else you gotta kill
to keep this secret?

25:04.175 --> 25:05.175
[Dick sighs]

25:05.175 --> 25:10.114
And I'm the one
with the anger issues?

25:10.146 --> 25:12.883
What now, genius?

25:12.915 --> 25:13.951
Come on.

25:13.951 --> 25:18.951
-What say we--

when you see it.</i>

25:30.300 --> 25:32.836
[line disconnects]

25:32.869 --> 25:35.105
Deathstroke again, huh?

25:35.138 --> 25:37.307
Let me guess.

25:37.340 --> 25:39.590
We have a date.

25:45.449 --> 25:50.386
I need chives.

25:50.421 --> 25:53.871
Chives coming right up.

26:01.531 --> 26:04.867
Did you take this
from my dresser?

26:04.901 --> 26:06.269
No.

26:06.303 --> 26:09.405
Somebody did.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.407
Somebody's fucking with us.

26:11.442 --> 26:14.612
-Bad timing?
-Look at this.

26:14.644 --> 26:16.547
This is our friend
who Doctor Light killed.

26:16.547 --> 26:17.815
Someone took it from my dresser

26:17.815 --> 26:19.617
and put it there
for me to find.

26:19.651 --> 26:22.519
There was a bottle
of orange soda like the one
Garth gave me

26:22.553 --> 26:24.888
waiting on my bed
this morning.

26:24.922 --> 26:28.424
A bottle of bourbon for me.

26:28.459 --> 26:32.630
Why didn't you tell me?

26:32.663 --> 26:37.663
So who's the asshole
playing pranks?

26:43.540 --> 26:46.540
[Dick] <i>Jason!</i>

26:48.880 --> 26:52.779
[monitor beeping steadily]

26:57.422 --> 27:00.157
[Kory] I don't know
if you can hear me...

27:00.191 --> 27:04.162
but you're one of
the strongest people
I've ever seen.

27:04.194 --> 27:07.999
And I know, because I'm
pretty strong, too.

27:08.031 --> 27:12.332
Thing is, there's not much
more I can do for you.

27:14.638 --> 27:17.775
You're making me
feel helpless.

27:17.808 --> 27:20.912
And I hate feeling helpless.

27:20.944 --> 27:24.181
So do me a favor, okay?

27:24.213 --> 27:28.219
Don't die.

27:28.252 --> 27:32.990
Because that will
really piss me off.

27:33.023 --> 27:34.759
[Gar] <i>What did you say
your name was?</i>

27:34.791 --> 27:37.328
My name is Eve Watson.
Please let me in.

27:37.362 --> 27:39.029
Look, I know this
doesn't make any sense,

27:39.063 --> 27:41.865
but I was led here
by a dog.

27:41.898 --> 27:44.669
<i>Is there someone
named Conner there?</i>

27:44.701 --> 27:48.638
Let her up.

27:48.673 --> 27:51.642
[beeps]

27:51.675 --> 27:53.243
I'm so sorry.

27:53.278 --> 27:55.913
Save the apologies.
Can you help him?

27:55.946 --> 27:58.316
Maybe if I'd gotten here
sooner, but...

27:58.349 --> 28:00.852
The kryptonite poisoning
has gone too far.

28:00.884 --> 28:02.653
Seriously?
Is that the best
you've got?

28:02.686 --> 28:04.989
I am a scientist.
I'm not God.

28:05.022 --> 28:07.758
You just told me
you created him.

28:07.791 --> 28:09.961
You're the closest thing
to God he has.

28:09.993 --> 28:14.465
Half of his DNA
is from a guy
that lifts skyscrapers,

28:14.499 --> 28:16.500
and flies faster than
the speed of light.

28:16.500 --> 28:17.667
At least fucking try.

28:17.701 --> 28:20.605
It's not about speed
or strength, okay?

28:20.638 --> 28:23.340
In order to save him,
we would need
a level of radiation

28:23.375 --> 28:25.210
that can't be found
on this Earth.

28:25.242 --> 28:27.811
We would need to
fly him to the sun,

28:27.845 --> 28:29.446
and we don't have
time for that.

28:29.480 --> 28:34.480
By now, in order to heal him,
we would need to bring
the sun here.

28:37.755 --> 28:41.954
Well, why didn't
you say so?

28:43.794 --> 28:45.829
All right, Eve.
Stay back.

28:45.863 --> 28:48.464
This may get
a little crazy.

28:48.499 --> 28:50.366
You ready?

28:50.401 --> 28:51.903
Uh... I hope so.

28:51.935 --> 28:54.771
-Rachel?
-Yeah.

28:54.805 --> 28:57.374
Obviously,
I am fully confident.

28:57.407 --> 28:59.943
[Kory] Just contain me.

28:59.977 --> 29:02.579
Let's do it.

29:02.613 --> 29:03.748
Okay.

29:03.780 --> 29:07.585
[breathes deeply]

29:07.617 --> 29:09.718
[wind rushing]

29:20.865 --> 29:23.714
[softly] Holy shit.

29:36.279 --> 29:40.683
[exhales]

29:40.718 --> 29:43.117
[Conner gasping]

29:49.492 --> 29:51.662
Well, hello there.

29:51.694 --> 29:53.194
[chuckles]

29:58.736 --> 30:03.374
Hi.

30:03.406 --> 30:04.775
[gasps]

30:04.808 --> 30:06.044
[chuckles]

30:06.076 --> 30:09.080
[monitor beeping steadily]

30:09.114 --> 30:12.782
It's gonna take a little while
for the radiation to
fully saturate your cells,

30:12.817 --> 30:15.952
but you're gonna be okay.

30:15.987 --> 30:18.321
I'm sorry.

30:18.355 --> 30:20.423
What for?

30:20.457 --> 30:22.526
You told me...

30:22.559 --> 30:25.363
not to be a hero.

30:25.396 --> 30:29.532
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

30:29.567 --> 30:30.669
Okay?

30:30.701 --> 30:33.738
I mean,
that advice I gave you?
That was terrible.

30:33.770 --> 30:36.000
The world is a much
better place

30:36.007 --> 30:38.375
with you in it.

30:38.410 --> 30:41.612
Wha... What's gonna
happen to you...

30:41.644 --> 30:44.213
[Conner hesitates]

30:44.248 --> 30:47.550
Say it.

30:47.585 --> 30:48.585
Mom.

30:57.595 --> 30:59.631
I'm gonna be okay.

30:59.663 --> 31:02.700
I'm going to get
as far away from
LexCorp as possible,

31:02.732 --> 31:04.669
but I'm gonna be fine.

31:04.702 --> 31:08.705
You're gonna need
a few days of sleep
to recover.

31:08.739 --> 31:11.741
You rest.

31:11.776 --> 31:13.726
My sweet boy.

31:25.957 --> 31:29.727
-[barks]
-Hey boy.

31:29.759 --> 31:30.960
[laughs]

31:55.185 --> 31:58.454
You really wanna
be back here?

31:58.489 --> 32:00.624
Where is he?

32:00.657 --> 32:03.393
He's feeding on your guilt.

32:03.426 --> 32:06.196
Like a spider.

32:06.230 --> 32:09.933
He's lured you away
from where you need to be...

32:09.967 --> 32:12.170
who you need to protect.

32:12.202 --> 32:14.070
He killed my friend.

32:14.105 --> 32:16.840
Nearly killed Jason.
He has to be stopped.

32:16.874 --> 32:19.809
Very heroic of you.
Except...

32:19.844 --> 32:21.511
you don't give a shit.

32:21.545 --> 32:22.645
[scoffs]

32:22.680 --> 32:25.615
-You don't know.
-But I do.

32:25.648 --> 32:28.051
I know everything.

32:28.085 --> 32:30.087
That's why you brought me.

32:30.122 --> 32:34.325
Just like I know why
you keep sneaking off
on these solo runs.

32:34.358 --> 32:37.260
Just like you did
five years ago.

32:37.295 --> 32:38.962
You have blood
on your hands.

32:38.996 --> 32:41.199
Not just me.

32:41.231 --> 32:43.634
But you have more, son.

32:43.667 --> 32:48.667
Blood only you
and Slade know about.

32:48.873 --> 32:51.709
You're afraid of the dark.

32:51.741 --> 32:54.045
Always have been.

32:54.077 --> 32:55.813
Even as a little boy.

32:55.846 --> 32:58.982
The great chasm of silence.

32:59.016 --> 33:02.753
The coldness of isolation.

33:02.787 --> 33:06.391
You're afraid if
the others know your secret,
they'll leave you...

33:06.423 --> 33:10.560
and you'll be alone, again.

33:10.594 --> 33:12.997
And they may.

33:13.029 --> 33:15.133
They don't need to know.

33:15.165 --> 33:16.968
What difference
does it make?

33:17.000 --> 33:18.568
It's done. It's in the past.

33:18.602 --> 33:20.104
It's behind me.

33:20.137 --> 33:24.174
But it's not.

33:24.208 --> 33:26.310
-It's got to come out.
-God damn it!

33:26.344 --> 33:27.912
[breathing heavily]

33:27.944 --> 33:30.981
Can you leave me alone?

33:31.015 --> 33:33.717
You know how to
get rid of me.

33:33.750 --> 33:37.951
You've known the whole time.

33:39.190 --> 33:41.625
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

33:41.659 --> 33:45.096
Of course you do, son.

33:45.128 --> 33:49.133
You always have.

33:49.166 --> 33:53.967
You just have to
tell the truth.

33:59.042 --> 34:01.143
It's too hard.

34:46.990 --> 34:49.726
[Bruce] He left those for you.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.530
Go home, Dick.

34:52.563 --> 34:54.431
It seems like
one way or another,

34:54.465 --> 34:59.465
the monster's been
in the Tower all along.

35:33.271 --> 35:36.806
[screams]

35:36.840 --> 35:39.840
[Dick] <i>Jason!</i>

35:41.911 --> 35:43.561
<i>No!</i>

35:52.422 --> 35:54.224
[Rachel]
How fucked up are you?

35:54.257 --> 35:57.295
All you do is give people
reasons to hate you.

35:57.327 --> 35:59.496
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:59.530 --> 36:03.668
The crosses on my mirror.

36:03.668 --> 36:05.369
I still don't know what
the fuck you're talking--

36:05.369 --> 36:10.039
Don't fucking lie to me!

36:10.074 --> 36:14.811
I'm sick of this shit.

36:14.844 --> 36:17.782
Fuck!

36:17.815 --> 36:20.016
Don't fucking walk
away from me.

36:20.016 --> 36:21.385
Whoa. Hey,
what's happening here?

36:21.385 --> 36:23.619
Jason drew crucifixes
all over my mirror.

36:23.619 --> 36:24.454
Bullshit.

36:24.454 --> 36:26.222
Jason, it's okay
if you're angry.

36:26.257 --> 36:27.525
I didn't do shit, okay?

36:27.557 --> 36:29.460
Don't blame me
for her voodoo issues.

36:29.494 --> 36:31.096
[Donna] What's all
the drama about?

36:31.128 --> 36:33.463
Somebody drew crosses
on Rachel's mirror and
she thinks Jason did it.

36:33.463 --> 36:34.532
[Rachel] I know he did it.

36:34.565 --> 36:36.434
[Hank] Cute idea
with the bourbon bottle.

36:36.467 --> 36:39.570
Not my type though.
I'm more of a sour mash guy.

36:39.603 --> 36:41.539
You ever go in my room
and pull that shit again,

36:41.572 --> 36:45.876
I'll forget
what team you're on.

36:45.909 --> 36:47.411
Why, Jason?

36:47.445 --> 36:49.646
I don't know what happened,
guys, but I didn't do it.

36:49.681 --> 36:51.181
What about
the picture of Ellis?

36:51.215 --> 36:52.250
The orange soda bottle?

36:52.250 --> 36:53.550
[Rachel] He did it
to you guys, too?

36:53.550 --> 36:55.452
-Fuck this.
-Hey, we're not done here, kid.

36:55.485 --> 36:59.523
You people are insane!

36:59.556 --> 37:03.594
I'd rather be with Deathstroke
than you assholes.

37:03.628 --> 37:06.264
You think everything's
my fault.

37:06.297 --> 37:08.697
[elevator dings]

37:15.706 --> 37:17.740
He's here.

37:17.775 --> 37:19.277
[Hank] What?

37:19.309 --> 37:21.378
Deathstroke, here,
in the Tower.

37:21.411 --> 37:23.079
He took pictures
of all of us.

37:23.114 --> 37:24.882
Can't a guy sleep in?

37:24.914 --> 37:27.952
[Hank] Dick, talk to me.

37:27.985 --> 37:30.954
What's with the gun?

37:30.987 --> 37:33.123
Psst. Yoo-hoo.

37:33.157 --> 37:37.228
There's somebody missing.

37:37.260 --> 37:38.260
Jason.

37:45.268 --> 37:46.503
[door opens]

37:46.536 --> 37:50.039
[Dick] Jason?

37:50.074 --> 37:53.311
I keep falling.

37:53.344 --> 37:56.146
You're okay.

37:56.179 --> 37:58.416
No.

37:58.449 --> 38:00.548
It won't stop.

38:04.021 --> 38:07.123
-Listen--
-Bruce wasn't the first one,
you know...

38:07.157 --> 38:10.893
tried to help me.

38:10.927 --> 38:11.996
I can make a list.

38:12.028 --> 38:14.898
Relatives, teachers, cops.

38:14.931 --> 38:18.369
You.

38:18.402 --> 38:23.402
Nobody's been up
to the task, Dick.

38:25.041 --> 38:27.811
I got a poison in me.

38:27.846 --> 38:32.846
Shit spreads, it can infect
even the healthiest people.

38:37.755 --> 38:42.105
Why don't you
just step away?

38:44.260 --> 38:46.496
No.

38:46.530 --> 38:51.530
[Dick] Step away
from the ledge, Jason.

39:06.617 --> 39:09.052
We can just
sit up here quietly.

39:09.085 --> 39:13.858
Together.

39:13.891 --> 39:17.161
[Jason]
I fucked it all up...

39:17.193 --> 39:20.498
coming here.

39:20.530 --> 39:23.434
You know, it's happened before.

39:23.467 --> 39:25.168
I once spent
two nights in juvie,

39:25.202 --> 39:27.804
and four fucking
people died.

39:27.838 --> 39:28.873
[sighs]

39:28.907 --> 39:31.742
It follows me
like a curse.

39:31.775 --> 39:32.824
[sighs]

39:37.447 --> 39:40.018
Nothing's following you.

39:40.050 --> 39:43.221
[Jason] I'm the reason
they all hate each other.

39:43.255 --> 39:47.958
The reason that kid got shot,
the reason this place won't work.

39:47.990 --> 39:49.427
[exhales]

39:49.460 --> 39:51.961
But I can fix it.

39:51.994 --> 39:54.695
Remove the poison.

39:57.601 --> 40:00.452
[Dick] Jason, wait.

40:05.342 --> 40:08.780
Can I tell you something?

40:08.813 --> 40:13.762
Something I've never
told anyone.

40:33.304 --> 40:35.472
It's not you.

40:35.505 --> 40:38.809
You're not the poison.

40:38.842 --> 40:40.443
It's me.

40:40.478 --> 40:43.181
It's my fault.

40:43.215 --> 40:48.184
It's this secret
that's making us all sick.

40:48.219 --> 40:49.719
My secret.

40:56.327 --> 40:59.429
I caused all of this.

40:59.463 --> 41:01.297
I did something...

41:01.331 --> 41:03.835
five years ago...

41:03.867 --> 41:07.318
Something unforgivable.

41:13.577 --> 41:15.211
I killed Deathstroke's son.
