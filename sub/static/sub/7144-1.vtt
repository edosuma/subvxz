01:10.862 --> 01:14.199
Carmen, Juni, time for bed.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.994
- Did you brush your teeth?
- I already did.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.082
- Juni, don't forget to...
- I am, I am.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.334
All right, all right.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.504
Okay, warts.

01:28.547 --> 01:31.216
Prepare to meet your maker.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.096
Everything okay at school?

01:36.346 --> 01:38.974
Yeah. It's good. It's fine.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.353
Okay, well, lights out.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.397
Bedtime story first.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.149
What story do you want to hear?

01:47.357 --> 01:50.068
"The Two Spies Who Fell in Love."

01:51.278 --> 01:54.865
Wow. I haven't told that one in a while.

01:56.074 --> 01:59.077
You probably remember that
better than I do.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.412
Want to hear a story, Juni?

02:00.495 --> 02:02.205
I'm listening.

02:02.664 --> 02:03.707
Okay.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.627
Once upon a time,

02:06.710 --> 02:08.711
there was a man and a woman.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.756
- And they were both spies.
- Yes.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.924
She from one country, he from another.

02:13.175 --> 02:16.428
She had a very important mission
assigned to her.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.804
He was her mission.

02:17.888 --> 02:22.225
Correct. Her mission was to take him out.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.394
On a date?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.772
No. Take him...

02:26.855 --> 02:28.357
You mean...

02:28.440 --> 02:30.525
- I shouldn't be telling you this.
- Go on. Go on.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.570
You have to understand
these were dark and confusing times.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.615
There was an enormous amount of turmoil
between countries.

02:36.865 --> 02:40.410
<i>Out of fear,
a new kind of soldier was created.</i>

02:40.494 --> 02:45.582
<i>Brilliant, brave soldiers
whose greatest weapons were their minds.</i>

02:47.459 --> 02:51.088
<i>Those men and women were spies.</i>

03:10.941 --> 03:13.318
<i>They were masters of disguise.</i>

03:13.443 --> 03:16.363
<i>They could sense danger a mile away.</i>

03:16.446 --> 03:17.906
<i>And through their work,</i>

03:17.989 --> 03:20.325
<i>wars were ended before they even started.</i>

03:25.789 --> 03:29.793
<i>The only things spies were truly afraid of</i>

03:29.876 --> 03:32.045
<i>were other spies.</i>

03:32.129 --> 03:34.172
<i>Enemy spies.</i>

03:34.256 --> 03:39.511
<i>So, sometimes, one spy's mission
was to make the enemy disappear.</i>

03:40.679 --> 03:43.807
<i>He was the assignment
that changed her life.</i>

03:45.308 --> 03:48.145
<i>But when the moment finally came
to carry out her mission,</i>

03:53.525 --> 03:55.318
<i>she couldn't do it.</i>

03:57.821 --> 03:59.948
<i>He was different than she expected.</i>

04:03.577 --> 04:06.371
<i>Sure, he was charming and intelligent,</i>

04:09.624 --> 04:12.127
<i>but he was unexpectedly honorable,</i>

04:12.210 --> 04:16.089
<i>and it made her realize how
years of working with detached emotion</i>

04:16.173 --> 04:18.382
<i>had taken its toll.</i>

04:18.591 --> 04:20.886
So, they kept contact.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.431
<i>A few lunch dates, very discreet.</i>

04:24.514 --> 04:28.602
<i>After all, they were on different sides,
so they could never be seen together.</i>

04:28.685 --> 04:32.230
<i>Dinner dates followed
wherever their mutual travels took them.</i>

04:32.355 --> 04:34.274
<i>And they fell in love.</i>

04:34.441 --> 04:36.318
<i>And they decided that, together,</i>

04:37.110 --> 04:41.406
<i>they would embark on
the most dangerous mission of all time.</i>

04:41.531 --> 04:42.783
<i>What?</i>

04:42.866 --> 04:45.202
<i>They decided to marry.</i>

04:45.285 --> 04:46.369
<i>Wow.</i>

04:46.495 --> 04:48.288
<i>Yes. On her wedding day,</i>

04:48.371 --> 04:51.416
<i>she felt like she would rather
brave a thousand deadly missions</i>

04:51.541 --> 04:53.502
<i>than go through with what
she was about to attempt.</i>

04:53.585 --> 04:55.003
<i>Why is that?</i>

04:55.086 --> 04:57.506
Well, marriage is a mission so complex

04:57.881 --> 05:02.302
<i>that only the most courageous
and slightly insane need apply.</i>

05:02.385 --> 05:05.806
<i>There's such an amazing series of obstacles
one has to navigate</i>

05:05.889 --> 05:08.934
<i>to keep a marriage together,
much less a family,</i>

05:09.017 --> 05:11.394
<i>that it frightened even her,</i>

05:11.520 --> 05:13.814
<i>a hardened and experienced secret agent.</i>

05:14.272 --> 05:15.649
But when she saw him

05:16.191 --> 05:20.445
<i>standing there with no doubt whatsoever,</i>

05:20.529 --> 05:22.989
<i>so assured of his decision,</i>

05:23.073 --> 05:26.159
<i>so enamored with
what they were about to do,</i>

05:26.243 --> 05:27.702
<i>she took his hand,</i>

05:28.411 --> 05:30.664
<i>looked deep into his eyes,</i>

05:31.289 --> 05:33.458
<i>and said the two most dangerous,</i>

05:33.542 --> 05:36.378
<i>most trusting words you can say to anyone.</i>

05:36.461 --> 05:37.838
<i>What?</i>

05:37.921 --> 05:40.382
<i>She said, "I do."</i>

05:41.091 --> 05:42.592
<i>That's so cool.</i>

05:43.051 --> 05:45.846
Yeah. Then the problems started.

05:49.182 --> 05:53.103
<i>Now, there was always some faction
that wanted at least one of them gone.</i>

05:53.186 --> 05:55.939
<i>On their own, each agent was notorious,</i>

05:56.022 --> 05:59.234
<i>but together, they made tempting targets.</i>

06:43.153 --> 06:47.699
So, they retired, settled down,
had a few kids.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.994
In a way, they exchanged
one life of adventure for another,

06:51.202 --> 06:53.079
trading espionage for parenthood,

06:53.163 --> 06:56.833
a mysterious and compelling mission
in its own right.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.920
And they're better off. The end.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.173
No "happily ever after"?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.508
I said they were better off.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.094
Great story, Mom,
but it needs a new ending.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.846
It needs monsters.

07:09.930 --> 07:13.099
Is that right?
Do you want me to look at your...

07:13.183 --> 07:15.143
I put the medicine on.

07:15.894 --> 07:19.356
Okay, munchkin. Good night.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.867
What was the story tonight?

07:30.951 --> 07:32.619
Ours.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.121
How many nights, I wonder,

07:35.205 --> 07:37.374
do you send the children
off to bed with nightmares?

07:37.499 --> 07:39.292
Carmen asked for the story.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.628
That life is over now.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.005
We are consultants, not spies.

07:55.934 --> 07:59.729
So, I went to their school today.
Had that meeting with the principal.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.567
Carmen's been skipping school
twice a month.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.653
- Why?
- I don't know.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.531
And those school friends
Juni talks about having?

08:09.614 --> 08:12.659
Yeah. Diego somebody and Renaldo?

08:13.076 --> 08:14.119
No such beasts.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.288
It turns out, the other kids, they pick on him.
He has no friends.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.667
It doesn't help that he has
his head in the clouds,

08:20.750 --> 08:22.836
making these weird drawings

08:22.919 --> 08:25.755
and burying himself into
that demented kids' show.

08:27.882 --> 08:31.177
They're keeping secrets from us, Gregorio,

08:31.261 --> 08:34.179
and I think it's our fault.
They've gotten this from us.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.099
We have good reason to keep secrets.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.518
If we told them we were spies,

08:38.601 --> 08:42.105
they'd have visions of danger
every time we leave the house.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.904
Speaking of secrets,
what are you working on over here?

08:51.156 --> 08:53.992
Nothing important.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.785
It's just...

09:05.378 --> 09:09.382
Why do we have to do this every morning?

09:09.466 --> 09:13.636
We already have P.E. at school.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.975
You gonna hang there all day, scaredy cat?

09:19.434 --> 09:21.561
Told you not to look down.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.688
I can't help it. I'm slipping.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.815
It's your butterfingers that are slipping.

09:26.816 --> 09:27.984
Hurry up!

09:28.068 --> 09:29.402
I can...

09:39.579 --> 09:41.915
You just fell 1000 feet. You're a pancake.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.167
- Am not.
- Are too.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.461
Don't trip getting up, pancake.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.091
Butterfingers.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.967
We'll see about that.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.438
- Donnagon?
- Yeah. He's missing.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.190
Is this what you were
hiding from me last night?

10:07.649 --> 10:08.858
I didn't want to worry you.

10:12.028 --> 10:16.491
<i>We now return to</i> Floop's Fooglies.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.952
Juni, why do you watch that show?

10:19.035 --> 10:21.871
Because it's cool. Why?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.790
Because that's all you ever do.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.209
Play its video games and watch the tapes.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.794
Do you know why, Son?

10:27.877 --> 10:32.757
<i>So, always remember, whatever you do,
believe in yourself.</i>

10:32.841 --> 10:35.927
<i>Your dreams will come true</i>

10:36.010 --> 10:38.721
<i>for you and you and you.</i>

10:39.264 --> 10:41.224
What's this supposed to be, a self-portrait?

10:41.307 --> 10:43.059
What's this supposed to be, a self-portrait?

10:43.268 --> 10:45.353
Mom, he's mimicking me!

10:45.436 --> 10:46.896
Mom, he's mimicking me!

10:47.021 --> 10:48.356
Carmen, leave your brother alone.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.441
Juni, stop talking like your sister.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.818
Stop it.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.069
Stop it.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.572
- Look at this. It's hideous.
- Well, talk to him.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.407
It's a Fooglie idea.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.992
I designed it myself.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.743
<i>Today, we're very excited,</i>

11:00.869 --> 11:04.038
<i>because today, we have a new character!</i>

11:04.122 --> 11:06.875
<i>We found him snooping around
the castle last night.</i>

11:07.208 --> 11:10.879
<i>I want you all to meet Donnamight.</i>

11:10.962 --> 11:13.715
Dad, when Floop makes a toy
out of that one, I want it!

11:19.596 --> 11:21.139
Honey!

11:23.099 --> 11:25.768
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

11:26.352 --> 11:28.271
Juni. Juni. Hey.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.816
Anybody gives you a hard time in there,

11:31.941 --> 11:34.944
remember, you are a Cortez.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.907
- What's so special about being a Cortez?
- Lots of things.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.867
Hey, it's the mummy.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.578
Nice looking bandages, mummy.

11:43.661 --> 11:44.996
Just stop it, man.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.789
When I'm talking to you, you listen.

11:49.459 --> 11:53.129
Nice dolls. Here, let me see the dolls.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.425
Have a good day, Son.
Show them who's boss.

12:00.178 --> 12:03.139
Can I help you with something, macho?

12:31.834 --> 12:35.421
I said, "Can I help you
with something, chief?"

12:36.464 --> 12:38.299
I didn't think so.

12:40.969 --> 12:44.180
My dad was gonna beat up your dad.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.849
No more secrets. Deal?

12:48.518 --> 12:50.853
Soon. Definitely soon.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.023
I even have to share a room with him,
because he's so afraid of being alone.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.568
"Watch out for Juni." "Take care of Juni."
"Show Juni right from wrong."

12:57.652 --> 12:59.988
I shouldn't be responsible for
anybody but me.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.864
You're so right, Carmen.

13:01.948 --> 13:05.285
What's so special about being a Cortez?

13:09.038 --> 13:12.041
I wish I could go away to your world, Floop.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.544
You'd be my friend.

13:23.886 --> 13:27.640
I thank you all
for attending today's demonstration.

13:27.724 --> 13:31.102
Year after year, we pay outrageous sums
of money to several inventors

13:31.185 --> 13:33.479
to come up with our technologies.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.816
Mr. Floop is one such visionary.

13:36.983 --> 13:40.528
However, his inventions
are somewhat questionable

13:40.611 --> 13:42.530
and, therefore, need to be evaluated.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.699
You promised us an army, Mr. Floop,

13:44.824 --> 13:49.037
but our first billion dollars
bought us only this.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.164
Mutated secret agents.

13:51.247 --> 13:56.711
The mutative process and brain wipe
caused their minds to turn to mush.

13:57.086 --> 14:00.548
I have found little use for them
except as novelties on my...

14:00.631 --> 14:04.385
Well, my children's show,
currently rated number two?

14:04.469 --> 14:05.636
Number two.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.848
What the devil are these finger men?

14:08.931 --> 14:12.435
They're called Thumb-Thumbs.
Very capable robots.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.274
All thumbs. Useless.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.736
Mr. Lisp, I think you'll enjoy this.

14:22.236 --> 14:26.532
Through that door,
an awesome power will emerge.

14:26.616 --> 14:29.202
You will have but a moment to disarm it.

14:29.786 --> 14:33.790
In exactly 10 seconds.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.250
Seven...

14:37.794 --> 14:39.379
Five...

14:41.714 --> 14:43.007
Three...

14:44.717 --> 14:46.177
One.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.392
Johnny?

15:01.484 --> 15:04.904
- You hesitated.
- I had to. He's my son.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.322
Are you sure?

15:07.907 --> 15:09.742
Actually, I designed him.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.494
I built him!

15:11.577 --> 15:13.121
His name is...

15:15.039 --> 15:17.834
X-5-2-4-9-5 II.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.002
This is your big idea?

15:20.169 --> 15:23.297
Robot kids that look like my children.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.801
The President's daughter?

15:29.178 --> 15:31.764
An almost exact replica.

15:32.056 --> 15:36.060
Sometimes, in order to think big,

15:36.144 --> 15:38.104
you have to think small.

15:38.646 --> 15:42.775
Through physio-electrical imaging,
I can make them look like anyone,

15:42.859 --> 15:46.904
yet the cunning and intelligence
of the world's greatest espionage agents

15:46.988 --> 15:52.201
all rolled into tiny packages
I call "Spy Kids"!

15:53.494 --> 15:55.037
Tell me, Spy Kids,

15:55.121 --> 15:57.123
with your vast stores of knowledge,

15:57.206 --> 16:00.626
what are four of the five
physiological indications

16:00.710 --> 16:03.337
that a human being is lying?

16:06.549 --> 16:10.720
They're not quite finished.
Missing one crucial element.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.722
Missing what?

16:14.557 --> 16:15.933
Their brains.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.979
These buckets of bolts
will never pass as children!

16:20.062 --> 16:25.359
We have a schedule to keep, Floop,
a window of opportunity that's closing fast!

16:25.443 --> 16:28.362
We will be back in two days
to pick up our army,

16:28.446 --> 16:31.324
or we'll take whatever you do have,
cut our losses

16:31.407 --> 16:34.702
and lay your entire silly empire to waste!

16:35.244 --> 16:37.038
No more time.

16:40.291 --> 16:45.046
Escort Mr. Lisp
back to his chopper, children.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.385
- That was brilliant, sir.
- Thank you, Minion.

16:51.469 --> 16:54.889
Now, all I have to do
is make them work for real.

16:59.769 --> 17:02.188
- You're going where?
- On assignment.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.191
Several OSS agents are missing,
including Donnagon.

17:05.273 --> 17:08.819
No ransom, no demands.
They just disappeared.

17:08.903 --> 17:12.990
After nine years,
you are accepting an assignment?

17:13.532 --> 17:15.826
- Why?
- In a word, Devlin.

17:16.327 --> 17:17.744
Devlin himself called?

17:17.828 --> 17:20.122
He called, asked me to go in.

17:20.665 --> 17:21.874
I'm going with you.

17:21.958 --> 17:26.045
Ingrid, you're always looking
to go on another mission,

17:26.127 --> 17:27.797
but we have children now.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.090
We can't both leave.

17:29.173 --> 17:32.760
I want to go on an adventure.
I want to save the world.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.721
Again? Honey, it's old.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.224
I mean, if it wasn't for Donnagon
and the other agents,

17:38.307 --> 17:40.184
I would be
turning this mission down myself.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.644
I mean, clearly.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.523
You're gonna turn me down?

17:46.482 --> 17:48.693
- Me?
- Spy boy.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.157
Ingrid. Ingrid... Ingrid.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.036
What about the children?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.163
- Uncle Felix!
- Uncle Felix!

18:01.247 --> 18:03.374
Hey, churros, how are you?

18:03.457 --> 18:06.961
Boy, last time I saw you, you were this big.
You're shrinking. What's up?

18:07.044 --> 18:08.588
Here, take this bag.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.548
Thanks for coming on short notice, Felix.

18:10.631 --> 18:14.051
That's what families are for.
That's what I hear, anyway.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.232
Do I know you?

18:35.323 --> 18:38.367
- Feels...
- Like old times?

18:43.914 --> 18:47.793
S-4-1-4 to Santa Cecilia
on assignment to Bond.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.004
<i>Missing OSS operatives.</i>

18:50.087 --> 18:52.923
Agents Ingrid and Gregorio Cortez en route.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.676
<i>Well, it's good to hear those names again.</i>

18:56.302 --> 18:58.846
- Good evening, Ms. Gradenko.
- Hello, Greg.

19:00.890 --> 19:01.974
And Mrs. Cortez.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.643
Updates.

19:03.768 --> 19:06.145
<i>They're being loaded into your central now.</i>

19:06.228 --> 19:07.563
<i>Scan the area.</i>

19:19.533 --> 19:21.243
All right.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.878
Why don't we call them?
They'll be getting up for school soon.

19:31.587 --> 19:34.423
- They should know what we're up to.
- Ingrid.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.968
You're right.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.804
Our first time out in nearly a decade

19:39.887 --> 19:42.973
and all we can do is
think about the children.

19:44.392 --> 19:47.520
<i>You should see OSS escort, Agent...
Code Delta...</i>

19:47.812 --> 19:50.106
Repeat the rendezvous point.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.691
<i>Believe in yourself.</i>

19:51.774 --> 19:54.819
Picking up a TV signal?

19:55.486 --> 19:58.447
<i>And you, Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez.</i>

19:58.531 --> 20:00.533
<i>I believe you have something that I want.</i>

20:00.616 --> 20:03.828
I know who that is. That's...
We've got a follower.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.956
Not for long. Watch this.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.465
What...

20:17.258 --> 20:18.300
What's that?

20:23.806 --> 20:25.725
They got us. They got...

20:32.815 --> 20:37.486
And this is what Carmen
would look like as a Fooglie.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.830
Oh, my God.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.540
Is this a fire drill?

20:54.253 --> 20:57.631
Put these on quickly.
We don't have any time to...

20:59.508 --> 21:01.218
Follow me. Follow me. Come on!

21:01.302 --> 21:03.095
Come on! Follow me!

21:05.139 --> 21:07.600
There's a lot for you to know
and very little time to explain.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.351
Uncle Felix!

21:10.144 --> 21:13.731
The first of which is, I'm not your uncle.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.276
Your parents are international spies,
good ones,

21:17.359 --> 21:19.445
but they've been mostly inactive
for the last nine years.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.696
What are you talking about?

21:20.780 --> 21:23.616
I was assigned to protect your family,
but something's gone wrong.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.409
I have to take you to the safe house.

21:25.493 --> 21:28.120
My parents can't be spies.
They're not cool enough.

21:32.583 --> 21:33.751
That's cool.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.465
According to the coordinates
in my locating device,

21:39.548 --> 21:42.718
they're being taken to Asia
or South America.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.930
- Go in there. I'll be right back.
- And if you're not?

21:46.222 --> 21:48.349
Hit the blue button to seal the door
and the green button to go.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.063
Is this a joke?

22:06.659 --> 22:10.246
Cool! Carmen, look! Carmen.

22:22.049 --> 22:25.094
<i>You'll have to go to
the safe house without me. Go now!</i>

22:25.177 --> 22:27.304
Felix, look out!

22:28.138 --> 22:30.599
- Yeah! Yeah!
<i>- Find the OSS!</i>

22:30.683 --> 22:33.394
<i>Tell them the Third Brain lives!
You must find...</i>

22:34.186 --> 22:36.647
- Felix, behind you!
- What are those things?

22:36.730 --> 22:39.108
- Get them!
- Felix, get them!

22:41.443 --> 22:42.903
Press the blue and green buttons.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.572
We can't leave Felix behind!

22:46.949 --> 22:50.619
Yes, we can.
Blue to close, green to go. Quick!

22:54.623 --> 22:56.667
- Here's the green button.
- Blue button first!

22:57.293 --> 22:59.670
Juni! You never do anything right!

22:59.879 --> 23:01.881
Blue, then green! You gotta seal the door!

23:01.964 --> 23:03.632
I can't find the blue!

23:08.053 --> 23:09.847
Hang on!

23:22.192 --> 23:23.569
What are those things?

23:23.694 --> 23:26.488
I don't know, but they're catching up!

23:28.949 --> 23:30.242
Where's the gas pedal?

23:30.326 --> 23:31.785
No! Don't touch anything!

23:31.869 --> 23:33.412
<i>Manual override engaged.</i>

23:33.495 --> 23:36.165
You weirdo! You switched it to manual!

23:42.296 --> 23:44.173
How do you work this thing?

23:47.760 --> 23:50.262
It was programed to
take us to the safe house.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.319
Juni? Juni?

24:06.362 --> 24:08.155
Juni, what are you doing down there?

24:08.238 --> 24:09.740
Help me!

24:15.287 --> 24:18.374
Hang on! I'm coming to get you!

24:24.463 --> 24:25.923
<i>Autopilot re-engaged.</i>

24:39.228 --> 24:43.440
<i>Wow! We are definitely
gonna be late for school.</i>

24:47.069 --> 24:48.570
Stop shaking.

24:49.571 --> 24:50.614
I can't.

24:50.698 --> 24:52.866
Stop shaking,
or you'll give yourself more warts.

24:54.576 --> 24:56.870
We're gonna be fine. Just be cool

24:56.954 --> 24:59.832
and do exactly as I say.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.250
Okay.

25:15.639 --> 25:18.017
<i>Welcome to the N.I.X. Super Guppy.</i>

25:21.562 --> 25:23.731
Juni, don't touch anything.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.442
Juni!

25:29.361 --> 25:32.322
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Cool.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.408
<i>Destination, safe house.</i>

25:34.491 --> 25:38.704
<i>Estimated time for arrival,
two hours, 30 minutes.</i>

25:38.787 --> 25:40.831
- Juni, close your eyes.
- Why?

25:40.914 --> 25:42.916
- Just keep them shut, all right?
- Okay.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.011
Okay, you can open your eyes now.

25:55.095 --> 25:58.307
- Thanks.
- I just don't want you crying all over me.

25:58.807 --> 26:02.061
We're never gonna see them again, are we?

26:22.164 --> 26:24.166
<i>Refreshments ready.</i>

26:26.668 --> 26:28.629
<i>Would you care for a lullaby, sir?</i>

26:36.261 --> 26:38.138
<i>Now flushing your poop.</i>

26:38.222 --> 26:40.682
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.193
Very dangerous.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.579
Characters from Floop's TV show.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.333
They're prisoners.

27:11.880 --> 27:16.093
We need the brain, Minion.
We're running out of time.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.511
Don't worry, sir.

27:17.594 --> 27:21.473
Ingrid and Gregorio Cortez
are the only agents I know of

27:21.557 --> 27:23.809
that never had a weakness,

27:24.143 --> 27:27.729
but times change. Now they have two.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.069
Did you lock it?

27:34.528 --> 27:35.571
Yep.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.951
That's the safe house?

27:41.285 --> 27:43.370
Looks more like an outhouse.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.793
<i>Your name?</i>

27:51.378 --> 27:52.504
Carmen Cortez.

27:52.588 --> 27:53.964
<i>Your full name, please.</i>

27:54.214 --> 27:57.134
I don't use my full name. It's too long.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.178
<i>Your full name, please.</i>

27:59.261 --> 28:01.972
Carmen Elizabeth Juanita
Echo Sky Brava Cortez.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.769
My name's a pass-code?

28:19.781 --> 28:22.159
This place is amazing.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.247
Empty.

28:28.540 --> 28:32.628
How safe is a safe house
if there's nothing to eat?

28:44.890 --> 28:47.309
"Machete's BuddyPack"?

28:52.356 --> 28:54.358
"Emergency cash"?

28:56.652 --> 28:58.946
From every country.

28:59.529 --> 29:01.406
I think I'd better take all of it.

29:19.216 --> 29:21.301
Check it out.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.347
"Thank you, Carmen!"

29:29.351 --> 29:32.229
We'll see them again. Just like they said.

29:32.521 --> 29:35.941
So, this time
we're supposed to believe them.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.616
Let's stop worrying about the children.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.243
They still wear diapers.

29:46.326 --> 29:49.788
Only one is in diapers and only at night.
It's not that unusual, okay?

29:49.871 --> 29:52.708
This is why I never wanted
to go on another mission.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.418
Are you blaming me for this?

29:54.501 --> 29:56.878
An hour ago, you seemed pretty happy
to be back in the game.

29:56.962 --> 30:00.215
An hour ago, I was not a prisoner of war.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.051
Okay, we're a little rusty, that's all.

30:03.135 --> 30:06.471
This is one way to find out
who's behind all this.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.224
If I can just get the pressure right.

30:15.522 --> 30:16.815
She's still got it.

30:16.898 --> 30:20.068
How did you do that?
Hey, hey, hey, what about me?

30:25.324 --> 30:28.493
Remember when we could
sense danger a mile away?

30:34.708 --> 30:37.169
- Those were the days.
- Yeah.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.261
Sweetheart!

30:56.396 --> 30:58.190
Clever.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.113
Okay, okay, come on, come on.

31:05.781 --> 31:08.075
- All right.
- Yeah, yeah, fine.

31:08.450 --> 31:10.285
Very clever.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.793
"Virtual room."

31:19.628 --> 31:20.962
Let's go.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.933
Where are we?

31:52.577 --> 31:55.497
You gotta give him points for imagination.

32:05.006 --> 32:07.926
Fifteen minutes to escape.
With your reputations,

32:08.009 --> 32:11.346
I was expecting something
a little more impressive.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.765
Finally, we can eat!

32:16.518 --> 32:18.728
So, you are Floop.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.564
You watch my show!

32:20.939 --> 32:23.066
<i>No, my son does.</i>

32:23.150 --> 32:25.026
<i>He does? Wonderful!</i>

32:25.110 --> 32:26.778
Carmen and Juni.

32:28.113 --> 32:31.074
But not your daughter.

32:31.158 --> 32:33.201
Carmen, isn't it?

32:34.077 --> 32:35.829
And Juni?

32:37.247 --> 32:39.624
Your children will be joining us soon.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.001
Careful!

32:41.543 --> 32:43.003
I snap my fingers,

32:49.134 --> 32:50.886
and my fingers snap you.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.517
Where are the OSS agents you've taken?

32:59.728 --> 33:03.899
Twelve years ago, they were part of
a research team for the OSS

33:03.982 --> 33:06.776
attempting to
create a synthetic intelligence,

33:07.152 --> 33:10.280
a compendium of spy knowledge,
if you will.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.574
Research since destroyed.

33:12.657 --> 33:15.160
If the OSS destroyed its research,

33:15.243 --> 33:16.995
it was for a reason.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.956
We all have our reasons.

33:20.373 --> 33:24.252
There was someone else
on that research team.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.631
Someone else who could rebuild it.

33:28.757 --> 33:31.092
Isn't that right, Mr. Cortez?

33:35.972 --> 33:37.015
Felix.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.368
I think he's gonna be a best-seller.
And just in time for the holiday rush.

33:57.786 --> 34:01.540
I will never, ever build anything for you.

34:01.957 --> 34:03.959
Thank you for joining us.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.362
<i>"How To Be A Spy."</i>

34:32.487 --> 34:34.447

34:36.533 --> 34:38.368
"A good spy uses..."

34:38.451 --> 34:41.663
- Testing! One, two...
- Gosh! You're too close!

34:41.746 --> 34:44.833
"A good spy uses his head." Got that?
It's the first one in the book.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.585
Gross!

34:46.668 --> 34:48.168
- What do you see?
- You.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.716
Very funny. Focus your eyes closer

34:52.799 --> 34:54.592
<i>on the glasses themselves.</i>

34:54.676 --> 34:56.678
Whoa! Maps and readouts.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.764
That's the computer screen.
It's a database of some kind.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.770
The wedding from the story,

35:05.854 --> 35:07.647
it was theirs.

35:12.736 --> 35:14.904
They should've told us about this stuff.

35:14.988 --> 35:17.949
Yeah? What about Diego and Renaldo
and all your make-believe friends?

35:18.033 --> 35:19.576
Should Mom and Dad know about that?

35:19.659 --> 35:22.162
What about all the days you skip school?

35:22.245 --> 35:25.040
- Want them to know about that?
- That's my business.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.961
- Carmen?
- I don't have a key.

35:30.045 --> 35:32.213
Go knock it against something.

35:32.297 --> 35:35.258
"A good spy has no fear."

35:35.342 --> 35:38.261
Sorry, Juni! Guess you can't be a spy!

35:42.557 --> 35:45.393
"A good spy puts himself..." Herself.

35:45.769 --> 35:49.481
"...in the mind-set of the opponent."
Mind-set.

35:51.733 --> 35:53.109
That's exactly what we'll do.

35:53.735 --> 35:55.779
I think it's up to us. You with me?

35:56.237 --> 35:59.949
- With you what?
- Find the OSS, like Felix said.

36:00.033 --> 36:01.951
- Okay.
- Then, let's go.

36:12.337 --> 36:15.507
Hi! I'm Ms. Gradenko.
We work for your parents.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.051
- "We"?
- I can understand if you don't trust me.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.637
You were a baby when we first met.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.016
Remember me now?

36:25.100 --> 36:27.477
Sorry. I have a key. You see?

36:27.769 --> 36:30.146
We're all on the same side.
We're here to protect you.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.564
My mom has a bracelet like that.

36:31.773 --> 36:34.776
OSS standard issue. We all have one.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.569
OSS? You work with my parents?

36:36.653 --> 36:41.783
Yes. Now, please listen closely.
Open your ears.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.994
Your father was able to send one
last communique this morning

36:45.078 --> 36:46.329
before he disappeared.

36:46.413 --> 36:47.872
It consisted of five letters.

36:47.956 --> 36:53.294
F-L-O-O-P.

37:00.093 --> 37:03.930
But you're wrong.
Fabulous Floop would never do that.

37:04.013 --> 37:09.644
Trust me. He's not that fabulous.
In fact, recognize these?

37:09.728 --> 37:13.481
Floop's Fooglies. I've got toy versions.

37:13.565 --> 37:17.235
This is what they looked like
before he mutated them.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.696
You mean these mutants
are captured secret agents?

37:19.779 --> 37:21.030
We're dealing with a genius.

37:21.114 --> 37:22.615
Told you Floop was a freak.

37:22.699 --> 37:26.494
And you know that cute, little tuneless
song the characters sing?

37:26.578 --> 37:27.746
Play it backwards...

37:27.829 --> 37:30.373
<i>We're trapped! Floop is a madman!
Help us! Save us!</i>

37:30.457 --> 37:32.375
<i>Floop is a madman! Help us! Save us!</i>

37:32.584 --> 37:33.960
A cry for help.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.503
Will Floop do that to Mom and Dad?

37:35.587 --> 37:37.005
Definitely.

37:37.839 --> 37:41.426
Unless he gets something
your father helped develop.

37:41.509 --> 37:44.262
If there's anything
you can possibly remember...

37:44.345 --> 37:46.347
- The Third Brain lives.
- What?

37:46.931 --> 37:51.686
Felix gave us a message
to deliver to the OSS, and here you are.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.647
Here I am. What's the message?

37:54.731 --> 37:56.024
The Third Brain lives.

37:58.818 --> 38:02.489
Carmen, you have just joined

38:02.572 --> 38:06.159
the ranks of women spies in the OSS.

38:06.242 --> 38:07.452
Brilliant.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.287
- Girls.
- Now,

38:10.330 --> 38:15.794
where does the Third Brain live exactly?
Did Felix tell you that?

38:15.877 --> 38:17.962
I don't think he said.

38:18.046 --> 38:19.547
He didn't say?

38:19.756 --> 38:20.924
Are you sure?

38:23.009 --> 38:25.386
Search the place.
It wasn't at the house, so it must be here.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.638
You were at our house?

38:31.768 --> 38:33.269
No!

38:34.646 --> 38:36.606
Oh, my God.

38:37.357 --> 38:38.733
It exists.

38:41.903 --> 38:44.113
That's what Floop wants?

38:48.785 --> 38:51.996
It is so beautiful!

38:52.080 --> 38:54.874
Carmen! She's working for Floop!

38:56.584 --> 38:58.253
Fly this to Floop's castle immediately.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.588
Don't move!

39:03.591 --> 39:05.927
You don't even know what those things are.

39:07.470 --> 39:08.638
I know they're heavy.

39:10.723 --> 39:13.268
That equipment cost millions of dollars!

39:16.604 --> 39:20.733
That brain's the only thing
keeping Mom and Dad from being zapped!

39:20.817 --> 39:21.943
Stop her!

39:36.958 --> 39:38.293
Send in the Thumbs.

39:43.506 --> 39:44.757
Wait for me!

39:50.096 --> 39:51.848
How do you work this thing?

39:51.973 --> 39:53.808
Bring her back!

39:59.522 --> 40:01.024
Don't you want to see your parents,

40:01.107 --> 40:02.400
you little brat?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.445
Sorry!

40:08.907 --> 40:10.116
Get back!

40:23.796 --> 40:26.841
What's wrong with you?
They're just children.

40:35.016 --> 40:36.184
Bad hair day.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.085
Going up!

41:18.768 --> 41:20.812
- What?
- Where did you go?

41:20.895 --> 41:22.438
I'm right behind him! Where are you?

41:23.106 --> 41:24.440
I'm toast.

41:26.776 --> 41:28.361
Give me back that brain!

41:29.362 --> 41:32.198
Get away from me! Tough guy, huh?

41:33.700 --> 41:34.909
See ya!

41:47.755 --> 41:49.132
My sister!

41:51.259 --> 41:53.219
Oh, brother!

41:55.304 --> 41:57.640
I can't hold on much longer!

41:57.724 --> 41:59.517
Get a grip, you big baby!

41:59.600 --> 42:02.687
- I'm slipping!
- Hang on, butterfingers!

42:02.770 --> 42:05.189
I'm not gonna make it!

42:06.566 --> 42:08.317
We're almost there!

42:08.443 --> 42:11.029
- Don't drop me!
- I'm not gonna drop you!

42:21.664 --> 42:24.459
What would you do without me?

43:27.271 --> 43:30.566
<i>It's a cruel, cruel world
All you little boys and girls</i>

43:30.650 --> 43:34.403
<i>And some mean, nasty people
Want to have you for their supper</i>

43:34.487 --> 43:37.740
<i>But if you follow me
You can all be free</i>

43:37.865 --> 43:42.453
<i>Free, you can all be free
As a bird on a big TV</i>

43:42.537 --> 43:46.207
<i>If you dream, if you dream
If you dream my dream</i>

43:46.290 --> 43:49.043
<i>It's a cruel, cruel world
Full of nasty boys and girls</i>

43:49.127 --> 43:52.630
<i>Full of selfish, mean, nasty people
Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty</i>

43:52.713 --> 43:55.466
<i>But there's a way
You can make your day</i>

43:55.550 --> 43:58.636
<i>You can laugh, you can smile
You can come and stay a while</i>

43:58.719 --> 44:01.973
<i>You can dream my dream
You can have it all with me</i>

44:02.056 --> 44:05.143
<i>You can dream my dream
You can dream my dream</i>

44:05.226 --> 44:09.355
<i>You can dream my dream</i>

44:18.156 --> 44:19.991
Cut!

44:28.833 --> 44:31.169
<i>Lock them up!</i>

44:38.342 --> 44:40.720
What does it need, Minion?

44:40.803 --> 44:44.682
- I don't...
- My show! It needs something!

44:44.891 --> 44:47.185
That thing that will take it to number one.

44:47.268 --> 44:50.313
I can feel it, but I can't think
straight enough to figure it out.

44:50.479 --> 44:52.607
Floop, you're spending
too much time on this program

44:52.690 --> 44:55.860
when you should be more concerned
with our grand, diabolical plan.

44:55.943 --> 44:58.487
- Syndication?
- The army of robot children, sir.

44:58.571 --> 45:02.200
This hardware is getting in the way of
my creative abilities.

45:05.203 --> 45:06.871
You lost the children.

45:06.954 --> 45:08.206
Not only did they escape,

45:08.497 --> 45:10.625
they took the Third Brain with them.

45:10.708 --> 45:14.921
- It exists?
- Completely. Cortez lied to us.

45:15.004 --> 45:16.130
Send our best Thumbs.

45:16.214 --> 45:19.133
Sir, if you want to catch a criminal,

45:19.217 --> 45:20.927
you send a criminal.

45:21.010 --> 45:23.137
If you want to snare a spy...

45:23.221 --> 45:26.349
Please speak English, Minion!
I've been baking under those studio lights.

45:26.432 --> 45:29.227
If you want to find a child,

45:30.686 --> 45:32.813
you send a child.

45:36.192 --> 45:37.360
That is brilliant, Minion.

45:37.485 --> 45:40.154
Thank you, sir.

46:10.434 --> 46:12.270
Some locating device.

46:12.353 --> 46:14.939
I can't even figure out
where the coordinates point to.

46:15.648 --> 46:18.901
Who makes this? "Machete Products."

46:39.880 --> 46:41.299
What are you doing?

46:41.382 --> 46:43.384
That's our bargaining chip
on getting Mom and Dad back.

46:43.467 --> 46:45.136
This is what Floop wants.

46:45.219 --> 46:47.888
I think Mom and Dad
would want this destroyed.

46:48.139 --> 46:49.140
How do you know what they want?

46:49.223 --> 46:51.559
Until this morning,
you didn't even know who they were.

46:51.726 --> 46:53.561
We keep the brain.

46:53.936 --> 46:55.313
For now.

46:55.896 --> 46:57.231
Why are you still wearing that?

46:57.315 --> 46:59.859
That could be a tracer.
They could be tracking us.

47:00.192 --> 47:03.821
Don't start pointing fingers at me.
I didn't do anything stupid, stupid.

47:03.904 --> 47:05.364
You better stop calling me names.

47:05.573 --> 47:07.158
Or what?

47:07.241 --> 47:09.410
Or I'm gonna call you names.

47:13.998 --> 47:15.249
The booger was right.

47:16.334 --> 47:18.294
I hate that!

47:27.011 --> 47:28.929
Thought I ditched you.

47:29.263 --> 47:31.140
Why are you dressed like a geek?

47:31.682 --> 47:33.392
We're no longer relatives. Go away.

47:36.312 --> 47:38.439
You're just getting stupider by the minute.

47:38.898 --> 47:40.107
Get away from me.

47:40.775 --> 47:43.277
Hey! Put me down!

47:47.740 --> 47:49.116
Always wanted to do this.

47:52.995 --> 47:54.914
Tough guy, huh?

47:57.792 --> 48:00.127
- Juni!
- Put me down!

48:00.211 --> 48:01.545
Destroy the brain!

48:01.754 --> 48:03.798
Destroy it!

49:23.377 --> 49:25.296
They took the brain?

49:25.379 --> 49:29.467
Yeah, but I took her necklace.
She didn't even notice.

49:29.550 --> 49:32.386
They weren't very smart.
Yours couldn't even speak.

49:32.470 --> 49:34.722
"Limited edition Spy Kid,

49:35.139 --> 49:37.183
"1 of 500."

49:37.266 --> 49:39.810
Floop's gonna have
hundreds of these flying around.

49:39.894 --> 49:41.770
The Third Brain makes them smart.

49:41.896 --> 49:44.523
They're building an army.

49:45.274 --> 49:49.195
We've got to save Mom and Dad.
Only they can stop the robots.

49:49.403 --> 49:51.280
But who's gonna help us?

49:54.241 --> 49:56.035
We had it working.

49:56.911 --> 49:59.622
A synthetic intelligence as smart as any spy.

50:01.540 --> 50:04.835
Why don't you go ahead
and tighten that brain up?

50:06.462 --> 50:08.464
<i>The Third Brain System.</i>

50:10.090 --> 50:12.468
<i>The OSS director realized</i>

50:12.551 --> 50:16.931
<i>it was too dangerous if
the wrong forces found the technology.</i>

50:17.014 --> 50:19.266
<i>We were ordered to destroy it.</i>

50:23.938 --> 50:26.273
Why keep that a secret from me?

50:26.815 --> 50:29.777
To protect us from
something you destroyed?

50:31.529 --> 50:32.613
Or something you didn't?

50:42.957 --> 50:46.418
All these secrets from me,
from the children,

50:46.752 --> 50:48.170
it has to stop.

50:48.712 --> 50:50.089
I'm sorry.

50:50.798 --> 50:52.132
He wants the brain.

50:52.383 --> 50:54.760
If we save our children, we risk the world.

50:54.843 --> 50:57.555
So, what in the world do we do?

50:59.181 --> 51:03.769
Thanks for taking us this far,
but this is all we got.

51:08.857 --> 51:10.651
What are we doing here?

51:11.193 --> 51:13.404
Dad's code name must be "Hombre."

51:13.904 --> 51:16.282
So, this must be Machete.

51:16.365 --> 51:19.660
We're getting help from Dad's best man?

51:30.921 --> 51:32.756
What are you working on?

51:32.840 --> 51:35.342
World's smallest camera.

51:36.719 --> 51:37.970
I don't see it.

51:38.345 --> 51:40.514
But it sees you.

51:41.682 --> 51:43.350
You sell counterintelligence stuff here?

51:43.517 --> 51:46.353
- Come back with your parents.
- We can't.

51:47.730 --> 51:50.816
We need something fast
that can get us here.

51:53.152 --> 51:54.194
Who are you?

51:54.278 --> 51:57.031
Carmen Elizabeth Juanita
Echo Sky Brava Cortez.

52:00.200 --> 52:02.202
Gregorio Cortez is our father.

52:02.745 --> 52:04.288
You were at his wedding.

52:06.165 --> 52:09.793
You will turn around,
you will leave my shop,

52:09.877 --> 52:12.963
because I never want to hear
my brother's name mentioned again.

52:13.047 --> 52:14.757
You're our uncle?

52:14.840 --> 52:17.801
Our real uncle?
'Cause we already got a fake uncle.

52:18.135 --> 52:21.430
Gregorio Cortez is my younger brother.

52:31.065 --> 52:34.735
President's daughter. President's son.

52:34.860 --> 52:37.988
Good. Prime Minister's son.

52:38.238 --> 52:40.199
General's daughter.

52:40.282 --> 52:43.243
They're all here as planned.

52:43.869 --> 52:46.997
I have to get back to my show now.

52:47.081 --> 52:50.042
You must focus on the task at hand.

52:50.125 --> 52:53.712
We have to prepare the army
before Mr. Lisp arrives.

52:53.796 --> 52:56.173
I don't believe in this anymore, Minion.

52:56.507 --> 52:59.426
- I don't think I ever did.
- Explain.

53:00.344 --> 53:03.305
The mutated agents, the robot kids,

53:03.555 --> 53:06.934
- those aren't my ideas. They're yours.
- So, what?

53:07.267 --> 53:10.187
I think that's why they're not working.

53:10.312 --> 53:11.438
Not yet, they're not.

53:14.483 --> 53:15.567
But, you see,

53:15.984 --> 53:17.611
I now have the Third Brain.

53:18.153 --> 53:19.988
I don't need you anymore.

53:25.285 --> 53:26.328
Minion?

53:27.788 --> 53:29.915
I assure you, it's Mr. Minion now.

53:30.290 --> 53:33.585
And you, Floop, have served your purpose.

53:33.711 --> 53:35.212
Children,

53:35.462 --> 53:39.049
lock him in the virtual room.

53:43.137 --> 53:44.555
You're a secret agent, aren't you?

53:44.638 --> 53:46.223
What makes you say that?

53:46.306 --> 53:49.059
According to the database,
you're always traveling,

53:49.143 --> 53:51.854
and no one knows what you do for a living.

53:51.937 --> 53:54.064
I think we all have uncles like that.

53:54.273 --> 53:57.067
"Another fine Machete product."

53:57.484 --> 54:01.321
You make the best spy inventions
in the world.

54:01.947 --> 54:03.157
That's correct.

54:03.240 --> 54:05.826
Yeah, but you sell them
to both sides, good and bad.

54:06.160 --> 54:08.746
That's why Dad hasn't spoken of you
in all these years.

54:10.456 --> 54:11.999
Ever sell stuff to Floop?

54:14.501 --> 54:16.336
- Why?
- Our mom and dad,

54:16.420 --> 54:19.298
your brother, are his prisoners,
and if we don't do something to help,

54:19.381 --> 54:22.384
something really bad is
gonna happen to them.

54:23.177 --> 54:24.845
I don't see why you won't help him!

54:24.928 --> 54:27.097
You think I want to baby-sit my brother
the rest of my life?

54:27.181 --> 54:29.224
"Watch out for Gregorio."
"Take care of Gregorio."

54:29.308 --> 54:31.268
"Make sure Gregorio
knows right from wrong."

54:31.351 --> 54:33.020
Not anymore.

54:33.103 --> 54:36.398
Machete's not responsible
for nobody but Machete.

54:37.441 --> 54:39.067
But that's not what family is.

54:39.151 --> 54:41.862
We're just brothers.
Cain and Abel were brothers.

54:41.945 --> 54:43.864
Look how they ended up.

54:46.241 --> 54:52.080
Now, the only thing that will get you to
Floop's castle fast enough is this.

54:52.748 --> 54:54.124
It's tiny.

54:54.333 --> 54:56.960
It's built for one passenger, but it's fast.

54:57.544 --> 54:59.963
- Will you go?
- No.

55:00.047 --> 55:01.924
- For your brother?
- No!

55:02.007 --> 55:05.260
Then how about for us,
your niece and nephew?

55:07.387 --> 55:08.597
No.

55:14.520 --> 55:18.065
- How about if...
- No, no, no! A million times no!

55:18.148 --> 55:20.234
Pass the pig intestines.

55:24.029 --> 55:26.323
I'm not eating that now. Nope.

55:28.242 --> 55:30.536
- Can I have a...
- No!

55:30.619 --> 55:32.704
Glass of water?

55:32.788 --> 55:36.583
Thank you for letting us stay here
while we ponder our parents' terrible fate.

55:36.917 --> 55:39.711
If you weren't a Cortez,
I wouldn't be doing this much.

55:39.795 --> 55:42.548
So, family does mean more to you
than money.

55:45.592 --> 55:46.593
No.

55:47.386 --> 55:49.054
Dad misses you, too.

55:59.064 --> 56:01.775
- Ready?
- Let's go.

56:08.073 --> 56:09.700
Now we're talking.

56:13.787 --> 56:17.291
- What are you doing?
- Getting the map to Floop's castle.

56:20.460 --> 56:22.462
It's just a reflex.

56:22.546 --> 56:25.132
Look. He's still asleep.

56:36.351 --> 56:39.354
Never send an adult to do a kid's job.

56:44.651 --> 56:46.153
Yeah.

56:52.784 --> 56:54.620
What can I do to help?

56:54.703 --> 56:56.997
Remember that spy plane up on the roof?

56:57.080 --> 56:58.832
Yeah.

56:59.166 --> 57:00.709
Start reading.

57:02.044 --> 57:03.086
Homework.

57:14.348 --> 57:15.390
No!

57:17.184 --> 57:19.353
Hurry up! He's coming! He's coming!

57:22.397 --> 57:23.941
Good-bye, Uncle Machete!

57:24.024 --> 57:26.026
Thanks for the plane!

57:46.213 --> 57:47.965
Okay, so here's the new plan.

57:48.048 --> 57:50.175
We get to the castle, rescue Mom and Dad,

57:50.258 --> 57:52.970
then somehow stop Floop from
using the brain on the robots

57:53.053 --> 57:55.639
before they're sent out
to dominate the world.

57:55.722 --> 57:56.974
Think we can do that?

57:57.057 --> 57:58.809
How hard could it be?

58:02.604 --> 58:04.940
I didn't do anything.

58:05.023 --> 58:08.485
Okay. Airspeed, fine. Altitude, fine.

58:08.568 --> 58:11.154
Autopilot, failing?

58:11.238 --> 58:13.824
Great. Another fine Machete product.

58:13.907 --> 58:16.284
Take control. We have to go to manual.

58:16.827 --> 58:18.328
Now!

58:18.829 --> 58:21.373
You were supposed to read
all the instructions!

58:23.625 --> 58:25.585
You skipped a chapter, meathead.

58:26.378 --> 58:28.046
Better stop calling me names.

58:28.338 --> 58:29.756
Pull up, booger breath!

58:29.840 --> 58:32.175
Stop it, or I'll call you names.

58:32.259 --> 58:34.386
Go ahead. You got nothing on me, warthog.

58:34.720 --> 58:38.640
Try me, diaper lady.

58:40.267 --> 58:42.936
Hope you're wearing one now.

58:43.937 --> 58:45.105
How long have you known?

58:45.188 --> 58:48.817
Since forever.
Mom made me swear not to mention it.

58:49.109 --> 58:51.028
So, now we're even!

58:52.738 --> 58:54.114
Now you've done it!

58:54.197 --> 58:56.867
I knew this was gonna happen!

58:57.200 --> 58:59.619
We're gonna crash
if you don't do something!

59:02.748 --> 59:05.375
You did that on purpose, you kamikaze!

59:05.459 --> 59:07.377
But now it's balanced!

59:07.711 --> 59:08.962
Landing gear.

59:11.548 --> 59:13.925
No landing gear. We're gonna crash!

59:15.635 --> 59:17.262
Nope. We're gonna drop.

59:17.345 --> 59:18.805
- Drop?
- Get your regulator ready.

59:36.990 --> 59:40.660
<i>- Com systems check. Can you hear me?
- Yeah.</i>

59:41.369 --> 59:43.789
<i>Let's try that cave over there.</i>

59:45.832 --> 59:47.834
<i>This must be in.</i>

59:47.918 --> 59:49.336
<i>You're kidding.</i>

59:49.419 --> 59:51.171
<i>It's a cave of sleeping sharks.</i>

59:51.296 --> 59:53.757
<i>- Sharks don't sleep.
- Wanna bet?</i>

59:53.840 --> 59:55.425
<i>I did a science project on them.</i>

59:55.509 --> 59:57.928
<i>At depths where
the water salinization's just right,</i>

59:58.011 --> 59:59.679
<i>they gather to sleep.</i>

59:59.763 --> 01:00:03.016
<i>I bet they're guarding the way in.
It looks like the door over there.</i>

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:06.103
<i>Wow. Cool.</i>

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:07.229
<i>Don't touch it.</i>

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:09.481
<i>Is it a man-eater?</i>

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:11.274
<i>No, but you're not a man yet.</i>

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:14.361
<i>It might think you're an oversized guppy
and gobble you up.</i>

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.738
<i>Hey, little sleepy sharky.</i>

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:22.119
<i>It's asleep, silly.</i>

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:23.662
<i>I knew that.</i>

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:25.038
<i>Come on.</i>

01:00:25.705 --> 01:00:28.125
<i>Sweet dreams, sharky.</i>

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:39.052
<i>A surveillance camera.
I'm gonna distract it, you wait here.</i>

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:41.638
<i>- Don't leave me.
- Wait here.</i>

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.357
<i>Say, "Cheese."</i>

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.569
<i>I hope there's a restroom around here.</i>

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:58.196
<i>I take a picture of the door</i>

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.782
<i>and place it in front of
the surveillance camera</i>

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:02.367
<i>so it can't see us go inside.</i>

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:05.245
<i>I gotta go pee, and I can't hold it.</i>

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:06.538
<i>Don't pee.</i>

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:09.666
<i>You'll change the water salinization
and wake up all the sharks.</i>

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:12.752
<i>I can't help it. All this warm water...</i>

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:17.090
<i>No. Another camera pointing straight at me.</i>

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:19.050
<i>What do I do?</i>

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:30.395
Why aren't you watching the monitors?

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:37.194
Get more fingers in here if you have to.

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:01.259
<i>I couldn't hold it anymore.</i>

01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:12.938
<i>I'm breaking the code. Almost there.
Wait a second, Juni. Keep holding it.</i>

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:19.152
<i>Carmen?</i>

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:22.489
<i>Leave me alone! I'm almost there.</i>

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:24.366
<i>Carmen.</i>

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:27.994
<i>Way to go, butter bladder!
Now we're both oversized guppies!</i>

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:31.206
<i>Go back to sleep!</i>

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:34.960
<i>Close the door, Carmen!</i>

01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:37.504
<i>- I'm trying!
- Try faster!</i>

01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:43.635
<i>I'll never pee again.</i>

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.031
A Thumb-Thumb.

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.075
A real live...

01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:32.976
What did you do to him?

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:36.396
Machete's electroshock gumballs.
It says "Long lasting,"

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.356
but I don't trust wrappers.

01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:51.453
Come on.

01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:01.129
Over here. Juni, come on.

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:08.720
- What are you doing?
- World's smallest cameras.

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:11.848
I just placed them
all over the main hallways.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.060
- Sweet.
- Thanks.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:17.645
Thumb-Thumbs and Fooglies

01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:20.648
coming up the south hall.

01:04:22.984 --> 01:04:25.612
- Got an idea?
- Yeah.

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:41.211
Agent Donnagon?

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:46.466
Where's my mom and dad?

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:51.971
Thanks.

01:04:55.266 --> 01:04:56.559
- I got it.
- What'd he say?

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:58.061
I'll play it backwards.

01:04:58.144 --> 01:04:59.729
<i>The dungeon.
They're in the dungeon. Hurry.</i>

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:01.481
See if they know where the brain room is.

01:05:08.113 --> 01:05:09.656
Thumb-Thumbs, everywhere.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:11.157
Let's see if they like bubbles.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:26.589
We'll be back for you, fellow agents.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:34.139
<i>All robots, please report to
docking bays four, five and six</i>

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:35.849
<i>for immediate loading.</i>

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:39.227
This is the ventilator shaft, here.

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:41.729
Yeah, but the dungeon's on
the other side of the castle.

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:44.357
How do we get there undetected?

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:59.497
I think they've gotten smarter
since the last time we met.

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:00.915
Intruder.

01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:03.668
- Intruder.
- Intruder.

01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:15.513
- Can you make it?
- I think so.

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:18.016
Come on. Come on!

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:22.353
- Carmen!
- Find Mom and Dad!

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:34.782
I hope this leads to the dungeon.

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:44.584
You, there.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.421
What's that on your hands?

01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:54.344
Warts, aren't they?

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:55.762
Great.

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:59.224
From sweaty hands sprout warts.

01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:02.018
Do you know why you have sweaty hands?

01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:04.020
From being scared all the time.

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.858
You don't look very scared to me.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:12.737
That's because I'm mad.
You kidnapped my parents,

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:16.533
made psycho robot children
and swallowed up my sister.

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:18.493
But I didn't want any of that.

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:22.288
- I thought Floop was a genius.
- You did?

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:29.212
You watch my show?

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:30.838
More than you know.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:37.011
Alexander Minion.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.055
Agent Cortez.

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:41.224
Wonderful to see you again.

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:44.269
- You know him?
- Yeah.

01:07:44.352 --> 01:07:46.729
He was on the Third Brain Project,

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:51.568
<i>until I noticed he was trying
to inject his own ideas into the system.</i>

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.528
<i>I turned him in.</i>

01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:56.239
<i>He was thrown out of the OSS.</i>

01:07:56.322 --> 01:08:00.034
I'm afraid I'm not nearly
the artist Floop is,

01:08:00.118 --> 01:08:01.452
but not to worry.

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:04.163
I have something else in mind.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:10.670
What do you think you're going to
accomplish by doing this?

01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:12.463
Well, you see, Mrs. Cortez,

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.299
I've always been methodical,

01:08:14.382 --> 01:08:17.260
goal-oriented, psychotically so.

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:19.886
I'm not afraid of you, Alex.

01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:24.934
So, I think it's refreshing
to, every once in a while,

01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:26.935
have some fun.

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.689
And don't worry about your little brats.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.024
They'll still be able to see you

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:34.319
every weekday morning
between 7:30 and 8:00.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:10.229
<i>I trust this time
Floop will have a success to show us.</i>

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:13.816
The Fabulous Floop is
away on other business, sir.

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:15.777
Your army is complete.

01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:18.904
The ultimate destructive force
is now within your grasp.

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.698
<i>I'll believe that when I see it.</i>

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.915
Welcome back, Ms. Gradenko.

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:33.086
It's good to be back, Alex.

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:35.087
Let's never have children.

01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:39.008
- So, Minion is the evil one?
- Yes.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.510
But I will be blamed.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.845
You have every reason
to be disappointed in me.

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:46.683
So, what would you do
if you could shut this thing off

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:48.309
and get out of here?

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:52.522
It's impossible.
It can only be turned off from the outside.

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:53.856
Just suppose.

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:55.525
I'd stop Minion.

01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:57.944
I'd stop the robot army and hope

01:09:58.111 --> 01:09:59.654
that the world would forgive me.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:05.410
You're my hero, Floop,
so I'm gonna help you,

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:07.662
then you're gonna help me.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:10.790
- Minion must be stopped.
- Just one thing.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:15.169
My show, what does it need?

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:17.255
I know it needs something desperately,

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:21.217
but I can't figure it out. Maybe you can?

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.803
It needs children.

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:27.056
Hold still.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.152
Now, let's stop Minion.

01:10:41.446 --> 01:10:44.115
Must be stopped. Must be stopped!

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.704
This one's for my sister!

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:54.208
Juni.

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:56.043
<i>Hola.</i>

01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:01.883
Carmen?

01:11:02.133 --> 01:11:04.510
- Juni?
- Mom!

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:07.263
That's my Fooglie!

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:10.391
The one I drew.

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:15.438
It's Dad.

01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:17.690
You're here!

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:21.778
- What's he doing here?
- He's okay. He's okay.

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:24.989
How did you get here?

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:31.454
Mom, I've been skipping school,
going places,

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:34.999
taking ferry rides in the city.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.800
It's okay. It's okay. I know.
We'll talk about it when we get home.

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:46.719
- Running off to Belize.
- What? You went where?

01:11:46.928 --> 01:11:48.638
You're right.
Let's just talk about this when we get home.

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:51.015
No, no, no, no.

01:11:51.098 --> 01:11:53.142
You can tell me everything now, okay?

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:55.478
Is that where you want to be,
free from your family?

01:11:56.187 --> 01:11:58.189
Hey!

01:11:58.856 --> 01:12:01.734
I used to. Not anymore.

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:07.657
You turned my dad into a Fooglie?

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.617
No, I didn't.

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:13.746
But I might be able to change him back.

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.223
Gentlemen,

01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:35.268
your army marches to meet us as we speak.

01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:38.813
Your faith and your patience
have meant more than you know.

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:41.858
I speak for Mr. Floop
when I say that the value

01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:44.151
we place on partnership is...

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:46.445
<i>Minion! This is Floop.</i>

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:48.531
<i>Please report to the robotics lab at once.</i>

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:52.034
<i>We have huge, major, big time
problems with the robots.</i>

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:54.745
- I thought you said Floop wasn't here.
- He's not.

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:58.833
<i>A problem, Mr. Minion,
as in</i> mucho grande problemo.

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:02.295
I'm gonna just be a moment.

01:13:07.174 --> 01:13:08.593
Minion!

01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:10.219
Floop!

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:13.222
Where are you?

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:14.765
Behind you.

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:18.477
What do you think you're doing?

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:19.937
You're supposed to be
in line with the others.

01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:22.315
You're supposed to be
in line with the others.

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:25.026
- Stop that.
- Stop that!

01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:27.403
- Stop that this instant!
- Stop that this instant!

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:29.363
Stop that right now!

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:31.032
Or what?

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:40.458
Clever boy you've got there, Cortez.
Very clever, indeed.

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:43.336
Yes. He gets that from his mother.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:49.508
Can I offer some sort of truce
in exchange for your daughter?

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:51.552
Spoken for.

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.554
There you are. Didn't see you.
Didn't see her.

01:13:56.766 --> 01:14:00.227
I am going to show you what happens
when you cross the line and involve family.

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:03.689
Now, let's get nice and comfortable.

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:10.112
- Promising.
- Thank you.

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:15.201
You couldn't possibly.

01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:17.411
No, but you can.

01:14:18.913 --> 01:14:20.873
Don't let go. Ingrid.

01:14:22.333 --> 01:14:23.960
Hey, you two, come on.

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:30.216
Fools.

01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:39.558
Come on.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:42.603
We have to keep the army
from leaving the castle.

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:45.022
Our only chance is to
get to the control room

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:47.066
and hope that their missions
have not been programed.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:48.401
And what if they have?

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:51.070
Then there's no one on earth
who can stop them.

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:53.906
- One at a time.
- Go.

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:03.499
Left, left, left, left!

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:06.210
That way. Where's Mom and Dad?

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:12.049
- Your doppelgangers have them.
- Can you shut them down from here?

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:15.469
It's too late.
The Third Brain is linked not only to them

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:17.847
- but to all the robot children.
- Can't you remove it?

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:20.391
We can't just take 500 brains out!

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:22.476
- So don't. Just reprogram it.
- That would take weeks!

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:26.105
- Just two words.
- A binary switch. Of course.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.524
So, they would define right as wrong...

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:30.818
And wrong as right. Come on.

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:33.279
But it's not that simple.

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:35.531
Figure it out. We'll be back for you.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.908
Teach them to be good.

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:44.665
Have a seat, Mr. Lithp.
You'll be more comfortable.

01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:46.459
It's Lisp.

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:51.964
My army, Ms. Gradenko,
is the only comfort I need.

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:53.966
They're on their way now, sir.

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:57.428
Minion?

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:00.431
What happened to your head?

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:03.976
Don't worry. I think it's reversible.

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.689
Mom! Dad!

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:20.326
Careful. They're stronger and smarter now.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:22.328
So are we.

01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:32.671
See?

01:16:38.177 --> 01:16:40.262
Shiitake mushrooms.

01:17:11.001 --> 01:17:12.670
Let's go.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:19.218
Lisp. I should have known
you were behind this.

01:17:19.426 --> 01:17:21.929
I take it you are Minion.

01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:25.474
Ms. Gradenko, I think.

01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:29.478
It's me, all right.
I owe my new look to your children.

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:31.647
Remind me to raise their allowance.

01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:33.816
Minion, I think now would be a good time

01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:38.362
to see a demonstration of those
wonderfully demonic children of yours.

01:17:39.446 --> 01:17:41.240
Certainly.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:59.300
Your parents were so easy to capture,

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:00.926
and you're not any better.

01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:03.304
Poor little Juni.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.974
Defenseless and weak.

01:18:13.063 --> 01:18:16.233
You're a worthless little squirt.

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:21.113
Juni! Don't listen to her!
You're not worthless!

01:18:22.114 --> 01:18:24.158
You figured out how to get us here.

01:18:24.325 --> 01:18:27.453
You helped Floop realize he was good,
not bad.

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:30.164
You talked to the Fooglies
and saved Mom and Dad.

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:33.667
You're strong, Juni! You're strong!

01:18:38.005 --> 01:18:39.798
You're not that strong, Juni!

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.094
Puny Juni.

01:18:44.178 --> 01:18:46.305
It's all over.

01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:05.032
Instant cement!

01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:11.789
That should hold them.

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:16.919
- Let's go find Mom and Dad.
- Good idea.

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.631
<i>All robots report to the grand room</i>

01:19:20.714 --> 01:19:25.177
<i>for a final demonstration
of your destructive powers.</i>

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:29.515
- Mom, Dad!
- Juni!

01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:32.184
Carmen, Juni, close your eyes.
We don't want you to see this, okay?

01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:50.160
- Any ideas?
- I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:53.372
Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:55.541
- Carmen?
- No. Juni?

01:19:57.251 --> 01:19:59.878
I've thought it out.
Yes, I've thought it out.

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:03.590
- I think I got it.
- Tell us.

01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:06.093
Family, here's what we do.

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:07.970
I'll take the 100 on the right.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:09.847
Ingrid, you take the 100 on the left.

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.057
Carmen, 100 center-left.

01:20:12.182 --> 01:20:14.393
Juni, center-right.

01:20:14.768 --> 01:20:16.562
It'll work. It'll work.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:18.439
There's 500 total, Dad.

01:20:18.689 --> 01:20:20.774
We need one more person.

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:30.784
- Isador.
- Hello, little brother.

01:20:34.747 --> 01:20:35.914
Children!

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:41.587
Tear them limb from limb.

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:46.342
Good. How? How?

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:50.304
I'll have to teach them.
Shaped by environment, man...

01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:51.972
Of course!

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:10.449
Minion! Tell them to put me down!

01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:13.118
Their mind is a mirror now, sir.

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:17.373
Anything we tell them
goes in one ear and out the other!

01:21:21.585 --> 01:21:23.504
Why did you come back?

01:21:25.839 --> 01:21:27.966
For the same reason I left.

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:31.053
You know what?

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:34.681
I don't remember that reason.

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:37.851
Neither do I.

01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:40.979
It's okay, it's okay.

01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:44.566
It's okay. Let it go. Let it go. He's fine.
He's gonna be fine.

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:47.236
He's emotional. Latinos.

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:51.156
Okay. That's it. That's it. That's it.

01:21:54.284 --> 01:21:56.495
So, what did you teach them?

01:21:56.703 --> 01:21:59.206
It's not what I can teach the children,

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:01.417
but what you taught me.

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:04.002
You won today, Juni,

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:07.256
and not because you were
the biggest or the strongest,

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:10.717
but because you were
pure of heart and of mind.

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:14.763
And now the robots
have learned that as well.

01:22:15.973 --> 01:22:17.015
Thank you.

01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:21.270
We went on the old-fashioned adventure
I always wanted.

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:23.730
And we didn't do one thing right.

01:22:23.814 --> 01:22:25.399
Nope.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.777
We did two things right.

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:31.405
There is something that we have to tell you.

01:22:31.488 --> 01:22:32.531
Your father and I,

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:35.534
we're secret agents.

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:38.745
We have something to tell you.

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:41.707
We are secret agents, too.

01:22:56.513 --> 01:22:59.808
<i>Eight more incidents witnessed today,
all in different countries,</i>

01:22:59.892 --> 01:23:04.146
<i>of yet another group of children
who've done some incredible good deeds.</i>

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:07.733
<i>It seems that a day doesn't go by
that another amazing child</i>

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:11.778
<i>performs some outstanding act of charity
or community service.</i>

01:23:11.862 --> 01:23:16.116
<i>Who are these children?
And why are they so good at being good?</i>

01:23:20.037 --> 01:23:22.498
I gotta have the business section.

01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:24.082
I thought you closed down your shop.

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:26.335
Yeah, but I gotta keep tabs on
free enterprise.

01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:29.046
Boys, can we please stop fighting?

01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:38.263
<i>Hey, kids, it's time for</i> Floop's Fooglies!

01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:42.100
<i>Good morning, my children.</i>

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:46.271
<i>Today, I'd like to introduce you
to two new characters on our show.</i>

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:48.941
<i>Carmenita and Junito.</i>

01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:54.112
<i>Cortezes.</i>

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:57.324
<i>An emergency assignment has come up
in the Far East.</i>

01:23:57.407 --> 01:23:58.534
<i>I need you on it right away.</i>

01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:00.202
Sorry, Devlin.

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:02.704
We haven't talked about this
as a family yet, so...

01:24:02.788 --> 01:24:05.415
Whether we come out of retirement or not

01:24:05.499 --> 01:24:10.003
is a decision that is up to us and our kids.

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:13.507
<i>Gregorio, Ingrid, I wasn't talking to you.</i>

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:18.136
<i>No, this assignment is for Carmen and Juni.
They're the ones we need.</i>

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:22.474
<i>They're the two most amazing field agents
that this organization's ever seen.</i>
