WEBVTT

04:30.203 --> 04:32.501
Whoo!

04:58.097 --> 05:03.467
You know, showboating like that
just makes you look desperate.

05:03.503 --> 05:07.269
Yeah, "Look at me. I can flip my ski."
Pathetic.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.401
- Yeah.
- Daniel, that was awesome!

05:11.444 --> 05:13.708
Nicole.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.644
Hey, Daniel, Nicole left, huh?

05:19.686 --> 05:22.814
Should've let me talk to her.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.493
Whoo-hoo!

05:37.603 --> 05:39.093
I love it out here.

05:42.642 --> 05:46.078
The Big Dipper.
It's my favorite.

05:48.047 --> 05:49.742
- Do you know that one?
- No.

05:49.816 --> 05:52.546
I got a D in Astronomy.

05:56.656 --> 05:59.557
So, I never see you with anyone.

05:59.625 --> 06:03.026
Do you have a girlfriend
out of town or something?

06:10.002 --> 06:12.095
Daniel? Daniel?

06:18.845 --> 06:22.042
I want you to feel this!

06:23.383 --> 06:26.784
This is what's coming for you.

06:29.989 --> 06:31.115
Daniel, are you OK?

06:33.326 --> 06:34.918
Oh, my God.

06:39.732 --> 06:42.929
He's a freak.
He's some kind of freak.

07:28.714 --> 07:29.942
Number Three's dead.

07:31.517 --> 07:33.951
You all right?

07:34.987 --> 07:37.820
- Yeah.
- Anyone else see what happened?

08:18.464 --> 08:22.366
I told you not to keep this crap.
It just slows us down.

08:49.228 --> 08:50.957
All right, let's go.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.938
Daniel.

09:07.079 --> 09:10.879
<i>This is the part</i>
<i>I hate the most, the running.</i>

09:10.917 --> 09:14.182
<i>But it's the only thing</i>
<i>in my life that's real.</i>

09:14.220 --> 09:16.051
<i>The rest is a lie.</i>

09:16.088 --> 09:18.283
<i>Even Henri.</i>

09:18.357 --> 09:20.257
<i>People think he's my father.</i>

09:20.293 --> 09:21.920
<i>He's not.</i>

09:21.961 --> 09:26.523
<i>He's a warrior from my planet,</i>
<i>assigned to keep me alive.</i>

09:27.833 --> 09:30.063
<i>I don't remember my father.</i>

09:30.102 --> 09:33.265
<i>All he left for me</i>
<i>was some kind of box.</i>

09:33.306 --> 09:36.070
<i>Henri says he'll pass it on to me</i>
<i>when the time is right.</i>

09:38.778 --> 09:41.872
<i>I got my first scar</i>
<i>when I was nine years old,</i>

09:41.914 --> 09:44.439
<i>near the border of Mexico.</i>

09:44.517 --> 09:47.281
<i>It woke me from my sleep.</i>

09:47.320 --> 09:51.347
<i>It was the first sign that the</i>
<i>Mogadorians had found us here on Earth.</i>

09:52.191 --> 09:55.126
<i>The second scar</i>
<i>came when I was 12.</i>

09:55.194 --> 09:58.493
<i>I was in Colorado,</i>
<i>in the middle of a spelling bee.</i>

09:59.465 --> 10:02.696
<i>As soon as I felt it,</i>
<i>I knew Number Two was dead.</i>

10:03.936 --> 10:06.700
<i>Last night, I got my third scar.</i>

10:09.442 --> 10:14.311
<i>I was just a kid when the Mogadorians</i>
<i>invaded my planet, Lorien.</i>

10:14.347 --> 10:16.815
<i>Nine of us children escaped.</i>

10:16.882 --> 10:21.319
<i>We were gifted, meant to protect</i>
<i>our people when we grew up.</i>

10:21.354 --> 10:25.051
<i>We never got the chance.</i>
<i>Everyone was killed.</i>

10:26.292 --> 10:29.159
<i>We are the last of our kind.</i>

10:29.228 --> 10:33.460
<i>Three of us are gone. Dead.</i>

10:33.499 --> 10:36.730
<i>They are hunting us down,</i>
<i>one by one, in order.</i>

10:38.571 --> 10:40.334
<i>I know I'm next.</i>

10:42.108 --> 10:43.507
<i>I am Number Four.</i>

10:43.576 --> 10:44.873
All right, well, so...

10:44.944 --> 10:47.845
Daniel won't be in school
the rest of the semester.

10:47.913 --> 10:50.381
OK. You, too.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.750
Your new ID.

10:54.587 --> 10:59.024
And this time, you stay out of sight,
huh? No school, no teams, nothing.

10:59.058 --> 11:01.049
John Smith. Very original.

11:01.127 --> 11:04.290
I don't want to be original.
I want to be invisible.

11:08.134 --> 11:10.295
This time was different.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.327
I didn't just get a scar.

11:12.371 --> 11:14.965
I, uh... I saw Number Three.

11:17.043 --> 11:20.706
I felt the knife, I felt him die.
I could tell we all did.

11:21.947 --> 11:25.314
- The others.
- We should get moving.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.013
Mogadorians could've
already picked up our scent.

11:29.321 --> 11:33.121
We're going to Paradise.
I have business to take care of.

12:41.827 --> 12:42.953
It's Bernie Kosar.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.397
Played football.

12:50.102 --> 12:54.266
- Yeah, he played for Cleveland.
- Hm. Good to know.

12:54.306 --> 12:57.070
- Next time, I get to pick the place.
- Yeah.

13:28.874 --> 13:31.536
That's all of it.
I'm going to bed.

13:31.610 --> 13:35.205
Ooh. Hang on.
I need a new picture.

13:36.515 --> 13:39.006
We have to wipe out anything
that hits the Internet.

13:39.084 --> 13:42.383
Say "Paradise."

13:48.460 --> 13:49.484
Oh, shit.

13:49.528 --> 13:51.723
This is why
I need you to be invisible.

14:23.262 --> 14:24.286
Get back inside.

14:26.232 --> 14:27.597
John.

14:27.666 --> 14:31.193
Come on. Come back inside.

14:40.746 --> 14:43.909
Little small for a Mogadorian,
don't you think?

14:46.285 --> 14:48.116
I'm sure he belongs to someone.

14:48.187 --> 14:51.281
He doesn't
have any collar or tags.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.917
Hm. Somebody, somewhere,
must miss you, huh?

14:56.929 --> 14:58.328
Come on.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.093
Another pair of eyes
and ears watching the house?

15:01.834 --> 15:05.133
- I'm gonna need somebody to talk to.
- Talk to me.

15:07.539 --> 15:09.439
Yeah, keep the dog.

15:09.508 --> 15:10.907
What are you gonna call him?

15:12.311 --> 15:15.246
How about Bernie Kosar?

16:52.478 --> 16:54.207
What are you doing up?

16:54.279 --> 16:55.871
I changed my mind.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.779
About what?

16:57.850 --> 17:00.910
Look, uh, as much fun
as you are to be around,

17:00.953 --> 17:04.013
I can't be a prisoner.
Uh, I have to go to school.

17:04.056 --> 17:06.081
- No. No way, too risky.
- Come on.

17:06.158 --> 17:08.683
Number Three was completely
off the grid and the Mogs got him.

17:08.727 --> 17:10.251
- Didn't save him.
- Mm-mm.

17:10.329 --> 17:13.890
Come on.
I'm gonna be safer if I blend in.

17:13.966 --> 17:15.433
I promise I'll keep a low profile.

17:15.501 --> 17:17.662
Look. Even if I let you, and I'm not,

17:17.703 --> 17:19.933
you can't just waltz into school
and start class...

17:20.005 --> 17:22.599
Do you think you're the only one
who can forge documents?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.344
Hm. Do you have a...?

17:26.378 --> 17:29.006
Five days of rations,
spare clothes, GPS, cash.

17:30.449 --> 17:31.711
- What's your name?
- John Smith.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.274
- Where are you from?
- Toronto.

17:33.352 --> 17:35.252
You seem kind of tan for Toronto.

17:35.320 --> 17:39.484
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I know the drill, OK?

17:43.929 --> 17:45.453
You keep this on you.
I'll call you every hour.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.123
If you don't pick up,
I know something's wrong.

17:47.199 --> 17:50.396
- Come on, every hour?
- That, or you can home school.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.461
And I'll be your teacher.

17:53.605 --> 17:54.970
Fine.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.942
Hey, John, don't be stupid.
You keep your head down.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.387
I know how to blend in.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.467
OK, doll. Take a seat.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.971
I'll just print up your schedule.
Back in a jiffy.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.470
I know she's
the star photographer,

18:32.511 --> 18:34.411
but it's not fair
to the other students.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.107
She's using up all the vital supplies.

18:36.148 --> 18:39.982
Emory, come on. "Strangers in
Paradise." At least she's creative.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.543
The pictures on her website
are totally inappropriate.

18:42.621 --> 18:46.113
Mr. Behrman, if you want to keep
the photos, you should just say so.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.558
Keep the photos?
They're already all over the Internet!

18:48.627 --> 18:51.994
It's a violation to post things like
this without people's permission.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.361
You have to do something about this.

18:53.432 --> 18:55.866
Mr. Behrman,
excuse us for a few minutes, OK?

19:03.442 --> 19:06.843
Sarah, this is not like you.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.313
Is there something going on?

19:09.348 --> 19:12.249
- Everything's fine.
- Sarah?

19:12.317 --> 19:15.309
- Honestly.
- Have a seat.

19:16.188 --> 19:19.487
You can't let a few negative students
get you down.

19:19.525 --> 19:23.325
Look, I don't want you to isolate
yourself from the rest of the school.

19:23.362 --> 19:28.390
- You should enjoy this year.
- OK, I'll try.

19:28.467 --> 19:31.561
- Good.
- Can I please have my camera back?

19:31.637 --> 19:35.266
No more photos on your website
without teacher and student permission.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.035
OK.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.804
Here's your schedule.

19:42.314 --> 19:46.045
Homeroom is calculus.
That's B-wing, room seven...

19:46.118 --> 19:51.886
Oh, Sarah! Could you show our friend
to his locker? He's from Santa Fe.

19:51.924 --> 19:56.418
<i>Job fair starts tomorrow.</i>
<i>Everybody, job fair starts tomorrow.</i>

19:56.495 --> 19:59.589
What kind of camera do you use?

20:00.499 --> 20:02.865
Eavesdropping?
That's not gonna win you friends.

20:02.901 --> 20:04.528
- Check it out.
- What?

20:05.871 --> 20:08.704
Tell that to the principal
with a fish tank for an office.

20:09.408 --> 20:11.933
It's kind of hard not to hear.

20:13.245 --> 20:17.443
Sorry. This whole place
is kind of a fish tank.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.908
Well...
Room seven is down the hall,

20:20.953 --> 20:23.581
and, uh, that's your locker right there.

20:25.524 --> 20:28.652
Good luck... um...

20:28.727 --> 20:30.524
Oh, uh, John...

20:30.562 --> 20:32.655
...Smith.

20:34.433 --> 20:37.732
OK. You don't want to tell me your name.

20:37.769 --> 20:38.793
That's fine.

20:45.711 --> 20:49.147
That's really my name.
John Smith.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.950
What's up, man? You new?

21:02.527 --> 21:06.827
Mark James. This is Kevin,
Jackson, Tyler and Max.

21:06.898 --> 21:08.627
- Hey, man, what's up?
- John.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.635
Good to meet you, John.
Where are you from?

21:10.669 --> 21:13.638
- Santa Fe.
- Oh, New Mexico.

21:13.672 --> 21:15.003
Play any ball out there?

21:15.073 --> 21:17.633
- Football?
- Yeah.

21:17.676 --> 21:20.270
- No.
- Play anything?

21:20.312 --> 21:22.473
Baseball? Soccer? Ping-pong?

21:22.547 --> 21:24.981
Nope.

21:25.017 --> 21:28.612
OK. No, that's cool, man.
That's totally cool.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.622
We could always use more
boosters in the stands, right?

21:30.656 --> 21:34.956
Listen. You need anything,
you ask us, OK?

21:34.993 --> 21:38.019
- We got you.
- I'll keep that in mind.

21:38.096 --> 21:42.590
Good talking to you, big guy.

21:43.268 --> 21:44.633
Look who it is.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.865
Watch out, man.

21:46.938 --> 21:48.530
Sorry, Sam.

21:48.607 --> 21:52.543
Loser!

21:55.013 --> 21:56.207
Wait up, fool.

21:56.281 --> 21:57.543
Thanks.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.910
Gotta love the classics.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.750
Homecoming king versus
the science nerd.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.815
Just get better with time, don't they?

22:07.859 --> 22:11.351
- That guy, Mark, he's...
- Soon to be irrelevant.

22:11.396 --> 22:13.887
He's in the third year of
the best four years of his life.

23:16.528 --> 23:20.624
So, she was like, "The solar system's
sun does not revolve around the Earth."

23:20.699 --> 23:22.633
I said, "Yeah, right."

23:25.570 --> 23:26.935
Hey, Spock!

23:27.005 --> 23:29.769
- Nailed it!
- Heads up! UFO, brother!

23:29.808 --> 23:32.140
That had to hurt.

23:32.210 --> 23:33.939
Hey, stay down, man.
Just stay down.

23:34.012 --> 23:35.172
He's gonna cry. He's gonna cry.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.715
- Oh, Mommy's coming!
- Oh...

23:40.051 --> 23:42.315
- Right in the face.
- Hey, are you OK?

23:42.387 --> 23:46.289
- Assholes.
- Yo, new dude! Little help?

23:56.134 --> 23:58.068
Jesus!

23:58.103 --> 24:00.230
I'm fine! Get off me.

24:00.305 --> 24:02.068
Come on, man!

24:02.107 --> 24:04.098
- You OK?
- No.

24:07.913 --> 24:10.507
That's quite an arm
you got there.

24:10.582 --> 24:13.415
Yeah. Who knew?

24:15.420 --> 24:17.786
So, uh, what's with the UFO thing?

24:19.524 --> 24:20.889
I know it's your first day and all,

24:20.959 --> 24:23.553
but, uh, sooner or later
you'll figure it out.

24:24.629 --> 24:25.755
Figure what out?

24:26.932 --> 24:29.366
I'm definitely not the guy
you want to hang with.

25:25.156 --> 25:27.215
Invisible.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.227
You heard me
when I said that, right?

25:29.261 --> 25:33.357
Yeah. Yeah, because
I remember you being there.

26:18.376 --> 26:22.278
<i>Let us face,</i>
<i>without panic, the reality of our times.</i>

26:22.314 --> 26:24.214
<i>The fact that atom bombs</i>

26:24.249 --> 26:28.447
<i>may, some day, be dropped on our cities.</i>
<i>And let us prepare for survival</i>

26:28.520 --> 26:30.545
<i>by understanding the weapon</i>
<i>that threatens us.</i>

26:30.589 --> 26:31.613
Yeah.

26:37.862 --> 26:41.320
How you settling in, bro?

26:42.567 --> 26:45.627
- Fine, thanks.
- Good. That's good.

26:45.670 --> 26:49.037
I see you and Spock are vibing.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.041
Got a bit of a soft spot
for freaks, do you?

26:51.109 --> 26:52.838
Who's talking?

26:54.879 --> 26:57.848
Yikes.

26:57.916 --> 27:01.909
Look. It's cute, it really is.
You are an adorable young man.

27:01.953 --> 27:04.148
But I find it irritating,

27:04.222 --> 27:06.349
so keep it on the bleachers, OK?

27:06.424 --> 27:08.517
- All right.
- Good. That's good.

27:08.593 --> 27:10.254
Also, while I'm here,

27:10.295 --> 27:11.922
I'm gonna let you in on a little tip.

27:27.479 --> 27:31.210
Find your place fast.
Catch the rest of this flick, OK?

27:31.282 --> 27:33.375
Jesus, dude.
You are soaking wet.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.906
John, get up.
Come on. We gotta go.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.007
John.

28:06.051 --> 28:08.576
- John.
- My hands. What...?

28:08.653 --> 28:10.917
- Henri. My hands burn!
- John...

28:10.989 --> 28:12.923
- Look at me and relax.
- What's happening to me?

28:12.991 --> 28:14.549
They called them legacies back home.

28:14.626 --> 28:17.254
You, the nine,
you're the only ones who have them.

28:17.328 --> 28:18.659
- Legacies?
- That's right.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.722
Your parents were members
of the Lorien Garde.

28:20.765 --> 28:23.256
You've inherited their abilities. Gifts.

28:23.334 --> 28:24.460
- Gifts?
- That's right.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.333
My hands light up like road flares.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.931
- And you call that a gift?
- Each legacy has its own function.

28:29.007 --> 28:31.032
There's...
There's more coming?

28:31.076 --> 28:35.740
As you breathe and focus,
you're gonna learn to control them.

28:35.780 --> 28:39.682
- OK. OK.
- Just like you're doing, right now.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.050
OK?

28:43.254 --> 28:44.414
How do your hands feel?

28:45.523 --> 28:49.584
- Better.
- Good.

28:51.429 --> 28:52.953
So, what now?

28:53.665 --> 28:55.155
Now?

28:55.233 --> 28:58.396
We wait. You're gonna keep
growing stronger and faster.

28:58.436 --> 29:00.165
I need you to be careful.

29:00.205 --> 29:03.299
Right now, you have to focus
your mind. Get some control.

29:03.374 --> 29:05.467
When you can do that,
you can get back to school.

29:05.543 --> 29:08.137
I don't want to raise suspicion.
I still have business here.

29:08.213 --> 29:10.044
In the meantime, your powers
will only draw attention.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.413
You keep yourself in check,
you understand?

29:12.450 --> 29:15.044
So I got all these powers,
but I'm not allowed to use them?

29:15.086 --> 29:16.280
Exactly.

31:16.407 --> 31:19.638
A little early for Thanksgiving.

31:20.745 --> 31:22.269
Paper or plastic?

31:42.500 --> 31:45.264
Whoa.

32:08.626 --> 32:09.752
And you wind it here...

32:29.580 --> 32:31.309
"Strangers in Paradise"?

32:33.885 --> 32:36.445
I know. Arty, pretentious.

32:36.487 --> 32:38.682
Uh... That's not actually
what I was gonna say.

32:38.756 --> 32:42.055
I just needed a name for my website
and it was right there.

32:44.295 --> 32:48.129
You know, they should've
called this town "Ironic."

32:48.166 --> 32:51.192
Ironic, Ohio?
Has a ring to it.

32:53.905 --> 32:57.397
What's up with you?
You look different, or something.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.340
Sarah, come over!
I got a new bike!

32:59.377 --> 33:02.005
OK, I will next week.

33:02.046 --> 33:04.378
- Hold this for a second.
- All right.

33:04.449 --> 33:06.508
Oh, they're so cute.

33:06.584 --> 33:08.677
You know, uh... I mean it.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.312
Uh... Your photographs...

33:10.355 --> 33:12.846
My parents make me babysit
for film money,

33:12.924 --> 33:17.054
and those are two of my victims.

33:17.128 --> 33:19.528
You know, I'm, uh...

33:19.597 --> 33:22.998
I'm actually trying to
pay you a compliment, but, uh...

33:23.034 --> 33:24.433
...it's not going so well.

33:25.536 --> 33:27.060
Oh.

33:27.739 --> 33:30.037
Right. Um...

33:32.176 --> 33:33.370
Thank you.

33:35.313 --> 33:38.714
I don't know, I just, um,
see better through this thing.

33:41.085 --> 33:43.679
It's like my own
personal BS detector.

33:45.990 --> 33:47.218
Come on! Let's go!

33:49.293 --> 33:53.229
Excuse me. Did you forget something?
You had two things to do, you know?

33:53.297 --> 33:55.458
- Lock the door and turn off the lights!
- That's Sam's dad?

33:55.533 --> 33:56.591
His stepdad.

33:56.667 --> 33:59.693
Every night
it's the same thing with you!

34:05.009 --> 34:06.476
This is it.

34:15.086 --> 34:16.348
You live here?

34:17.588 --> 34:20.022
Yeah, I grew up here.

34:24.462 --> 34:28.023
- It's just a house.
- I know.

34:33.738 --> 34:34.932
You hungry?

34:35.006 --> 34:38.305
So, John, just moved
from Santa Fe a few weeks ago.

34:38.376 --> 34:39.968
- The Smiths, right?
- Uh, yes, sir.

34:40.044 --> 34:43.104
- And your father's a writer?
- Yes, he is.

34:43.147 --> 34:45.843
Everybody really does know everything
in this town.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.442
Oh, gossip spreads like Ebola.

34:48.486 --> 34:49.783
Question game!

34:49.821 --> 34:52.119
Oh! Sorry, my bad.

34:52.156 --> 34:54.283
- All right, everybody, surrender them.
- Here you go.

34:54.358 --> 34:57.657
All electronic devices.
Come on, Sarah. Thank you.

34:57.728 --> 34:58.854
Hand them over.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.727
- And you.
- Mom?

35:00.798 --> 35:03.733
He'll get it back after dinner.
You'll get it back after dinner.

35:03.768 --> 35:06.328
- Thank you, John. See? It's fine.
- All right.

35:06.404 --> 35:10.738
So, Santa Fe's kind of hip, right?
You bored silly here?

35:10.775 --> 35:13.437
Nah, not with the spring carnival
coming up!

35:13.478 --> 35:16.413
It's fun, and you and your folks
should definitely come.

35:16.447 --> 35:18.745
Oh, it's just me and my dad.

35:19.784 --> 35:20.808
Where's your mom?

35:20.852 --> 35:22.444
- Uh... My...
- Mom.

35:22.487 --> 35:26.981
No, it's fine. My dad and mom,
uh, they didn't get married.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.959
Uh, you know, check it out.
Carnival.

35:29.994 --> 35:32.360
Sarah will be there
taking pictures for the paper.

35:32.430 --> 35:33.522
Cheap labor.

35:33.598 --> 35:35.190
- That is not why.
- No.

35:35.266 --> 35:38.030
- She's a very talented photographer.
- Question game!

35:38.102 --> 35:41.162
OK. Keep your voice down,
and we will play.

35:41.205 --> 35:44.902
It's a dinner tradition. Otherwise,
we'd never talk about the good stuff.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.341
Worst advice you ever got?

35:47.345 --> 35:48.642
"Pull this."

35:48.679 --> 35:49.907
Oh, stop!

35:49.981 --> 35:51.573
That's really gross.

35:51.649 --> 35:52.843
OK, um...

35:52.884 --> 35:55.148
"Your parents will never know
you're gone."

35:55.186 --> 35:57.211
It worked with your folks.
That's how she got here.

35:57.288 --> 35:58.778
- Stop it. Stop.
- Oh, my God.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.791
- What?
- OK, Sarah, your turn.

36:00.858 --> 36:05.591
Oh. Mom telling me that self-tanner
looks totally natural.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.858
She was orange.

36:07.899 --> 36:10.367
Like a traffic cone.
On picture day.

36:10.434 --> 36:11.924
Oh, you should go get that picture.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.231
- We still have the picture!
- John, you are gonna...

36:13.304 --> 36:15.033
Why would you want
to show him that?

36:15.106 --> 36:17.370
I shouldn't have said it.

36:17.441 --> 36:19.534
I think I tore them up.

36:25.449 --> 36:27.280
Sorry about that.

36:28.486 --> 36:32.513
- About what?
- My parents.

36:32.557 --> 36:36.015
They were putting on the
"aren't we cool?" show.

36:36.060 --> 36:37.721
They seem very proud of you.

36:37.795 --> 36:39.729
Yeah, and they're already
trying to convince me

36:39.797 --> 36:42.095
to go to the local community college
in Dayton.

36:42.166 --> 36:45.226
They'd love it if I stayed here.

36:45.269 --> 36:48.397
Got into wedding photography.

36:48.472 --> 36:51.441
What do you want to do?

36:55.546 --> 36:57.377
That's my favorite.

36:57.415 --> 36:58.939
It's got all these light leaks

36:59.016 --> 37:02.076
so the photos come out so interesting.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.950
Here, I'll show you.

37:14.865 --> 37:16.992
See that one right there?

37:17.068 --> 37:18.968
That's what I was talking about.

37:20.638 --> 37:22.333
What's this?

37:24.175 --> 37:25.199
Um...

37:26.978 --> 37:32.211
That is kind of private, actually.

37:34.118 --> 37:35.881
It's amazing.

37:41.559 --> 37:44.027
- What?
- You...

37:45.263 --> 37:47.788
You're allowed
to look at everyone else...

37:47.865 --> 37:52.131
...take our pictures, but, uh...
we're not allowed to see you?

37:58.776 --> 38:00.971
OK.
That's enough.

38:04.081 --> 38:05.946
Seems like you want to run away.

38:05.983 --> 38:08.008
I'll just be happy
when I can get out of here.

38:08.085 --> 38:09.814
I don't know.
I've been to a lot of places.

38:09.887 --> 38:12.355
You don't have to give me the
"there's no place like home" speech.

38:12.423 --> 38:13.981
I've heard it.

38:14.025 --> 38:17.654
No, no. You can go wherever you want,
see whatever you want to.

38:17.695 --> 38:22.064
But a place is only as good
as the people you know in it.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.732
I, uh...

38:32.443 --> 38:35.742
I think this is a pretty good place.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.296
Bernie, you dumb dog.

38:54.498 --> 38:57.058
- Does he belong to you?
- Yeah. I gotta go.

38:57.134 --> 39:00.763
Well, hey. Hold on a sec.

39:04.408 --> 39:05.670
Um...

39:10.348 --> 39:11.781
Your turn.

39:16.053 --> 39:17.384
Thanks.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.094
I'm fine.

39:34.171 --> 39:36.605
Heard you made quite an impression
in class yesterday.

39:36.674 --> 39:39.939
Flashlight. It was a dumb prank.
But that class...

39:40.010 --> 39:43.036
- Boring as hell? Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:43.080 --> 39:47.244
Look, I know it's none of my business,
but you need to stay off the grid.

39:47.318 --> 39:49.081
- What do you mean?
- It's all over the school.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.486
Mark James and his man-tards
have it out for you.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.580
Sarah may act like one of us...

39:53.657 --> 39:54.783
...she's one of them.

39:54.859 --> 39:56.087
He's into Sarah?

39:56.127 --> 39:59.096
More than that.
Nobody can go near her.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.825
They were like the town...

40:00.898 --> 40:03.230
Whoa!

40:03.267 --> 40:04.632
Loser!

40:04.702 --> 40:08.570
No... OK, come on...
Oh, God.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.602
- Sucks to be you, bro!
- Seriously.

40:11.675 --> 40:15.236
Want a napkin? Get a cleanup crew!

40:17.715 --> 40:20.047
I wonder who did that?

40:22.019 --> 40:23.316
What a loser.

40:23.387 --> 40:25.048
Leave me alone!

40:27.825 --> 40:29.952
Ah, ah, ah...

40:33.597 --> 40:36.259
Did you have a nice time
last night, John?

40:37.635 --> 40:42.129
You see, in football,
a quarterback needs a few things.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.663
Speed, strength...

40:43.741 --> 40:47.438
Mostly, though, you need intuition.

40:47.478 --> 40:49.844
A feeling when things
are going south.

40:51.949 --> 40:54.884
First time we talked,
I should've listened to mine.

41:04.195 --> 41:07.562
There you go, John.

41:08.933 --> 41:11.663
Good boy.

41:11.735 --> 41:14.465
Maybe you got some intuition
working for you, too.

41:18.175 --> 41:19.506
That was awesome.

41:25.449 --> 41:27.314
Raided lost and found.

41:27.351 --> 41:30.115
- Nobody loses anything cool.
- You gotta be kidding me.

41:30.154 --> 41:34.386
Dude, it was that or the <i>Hannah</i>
<i>Montana</i> sweatshirt. You got off easy.

41:34.458 --> 41:37.450
So, uh...

41:37.495 --> 41:41.124
...who's in the picture?
- My dad.

41:41.165 --> 41:43.463
The real one.

41:54.111 --> 41:55.339
<i>Where was that taken?</i>

41:56.881 --> 42:00.282
Mexico. The Yucatán.

42:00.317 --> 42:04.083
We used to go every year looking
for evidence of ancient astronauts.

42:04.922 --> 42:06.514
Ancient astronauts?

42:06.557 --> 42:09.526
Yeah. UFOs and shit.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.619
Freak show stuff.

42:11.695 --> 42:14.357
He called himself an anthropologist...

42:14.398 --> 42:16.958
<i>He was really just a foreman</i>
<i>at the steel mill.</i>

42:19.603 --> 42:23.095
<i>He spent all his time preparing</i>
<i>for some kind of alien arrival.</i>

42:24.909 --> 42:26.570
I used to think he was a genius.

42:26.610 --> 42:29.545
Had to, I guess.

42:29.580 --> 42:32.105
Nobody wants to admit
their dad's a freak.

42:47.031 --> 42:48.123
Sam...

42:48.899 --> 42:50.264
Sam.

42:54.171 --> 42:55.399
Oh!

44:43.280 --> 44:45.771
Malcolm, what were you up to here?

46:05.028 --> 46:07.394
Jimmy, Vince,
come on, slow down, boys!

46:31.054 --> 46:32.783
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey!

46:46.303 --> 46:49.363
Mark James decided to fire
a warning shot about you.

46:52.442 --> 46:56.708
When you first meet somebody,
do you dump all your stuff on them?

46:56.780 --> 46:59.010
All your mistakes, your secrets?

47:00.184 --> 47:04.678
Look, Mark and I, we changed.

47:04.755 --> 47:06.655
I got into photography,

47:06.690 --> 47:10.990
and he wanted me to be
his own personal cheerleader.

47:11.028 --> 47:14.555
Said I was becoming a total snob.

47:14.631 --> 47:18.032
And when we broke up,
that's what he told everybody.

47:18.101 --> 47:22.128
That I was a total bitch.
And everyone listened.

47:23.540 --> 47:26.202
All my friends.

47:29.112 --> 47:31.672
Uh... I'm sorry.

47:31.715 --> 47:34.878
I'm not. I mean, I was...

47:35.853 --> 47:38.048
...but, um, I don't know,

47:38.121 --> 47:41.215
I kinda look at it like a total gift.

47:41.258 --> 47:43.158
Got away from all of that.

47:44.528 --> 47:48.931
So, uh, what's the hottest attraction
at this place?

47:55.806 --> 47:58.434
You gotta be kidding me, right?
This...

47:58.508 --> 48:00.100
Don't be scared.

48:20.731 --> 48:25.100
<i>Save yourself.</i>

48:42.252 --> 48:45.085
Last year, she was drawn and quartered.

48:45.122 --> 48:47.613
It was awesome.

48:50.894 --> 48:53.624
My God.

49:04.241 --> 49:05.970
Hell's Gate.

49:06.543 --> 49:08.773
Everybody off.

49:30.033 --> 49:31.660
Quite a production.

49:31.702 --> 49:35.695
Hm. Small town.

49:48.018 --> 49:51.351
OK. The last part got to me.

49:53.056 --> 49:55.081
What is that?

49:56.660 --> 49:58.685
Don't! Let him go! Let him go!

49:58.729 --> 50:01.027
Stop it!

50:03.400 --> 50:04.424
Hello?

50:06.603 --> 50:08.901
Was that real? Are you all right?

50:10.841 --> 50:12.866
Let me go! Stop it!

50:12.943 --> 50:14.774
Leave him alone!

50:36.900 --> 50:38.868
- No!
- Whoa! Calm down.

50:38.902 --> 50:41.894
- Oh, my God. Just get off me!
- Sarah, come here!

50:41.972 --> 50:44.566
- Idiot! It's you!
- Calm down! Calm down!

50:44.641 --> 50:46.905
- Let go of me.
- You can take off, OK?

50:46.977 --> 50:49.411
- Let go of me! Let go of me!
- Hey, listen. I will. I will!

50:50.013 --> 50:51.275
Sarah!

51:05.062 --> 51:07.030
Where is she?

51:07.064 --> 51:08.759
It burns, man!

51:08.799 --> 51:12.064
Dude, let go of me, bro, it hurts!

51:12.102 --> 51:15.037
She's at Shepherd Falls!
Dude, put me down. What is that?

51:20.277 --> 51:21.266
Where's John?

51:21.344 --> 51:24.472
I don't get what happened to us.
I don't. I really don't.

51:24.548 --> 51:26.812
So you have your friend
throw me over his shoulder,

51:26.883 --> 51:28.783
drag me through the woods
to come here,

51:28.819 --> 51:32.846
when all you had to do is ask me!
Like a normal person!

51:32.923 --> 51:36.654
You don't have to tell me
I'm being an asshole, OK?

51:36.726 --> 51:39.957
But you're a problem for me, Sarah.

51:40.030 --> 51:42.965
Yeah, well, you really
should get over that.

51:43.033 --> 51:46.469
- Wait. Sarah, wait.
- Just stop it!

51:47.270 --> 51:48.862
You OK?

52:01.184 --> 52:03.550
I hope you can throw
with your left hand.

52:03.620 --> 52:07.886
No, John, stop! Stop!

52:19.002 --> 52:21.300
John. John, stop. Wait.

52:21.338 --> 52:24.364
Hey. I just didn't want you
to break his arm.

52:24.441 --> 52:26.841
It's not you, it's me.
I shouldn't have lost it like that.

52:26.877 --> 52:28.572
Hey.

52:30.981 --> 52:32.812
Will you walk me home?

52:41.791 --> 52:44.021
You should really get that looked at.

52:45.529 --> 52:46.860
I will.

52:48.165 --> 52:49.723
I, uh...

52:55.438 --> 52:56.803
I think we should talk.

53:00.443 --> 53:03.378
I know. It's crazy.

53:04.548 --> 53:06.015
Mark is insane.

53:06.049 --> 53:08.950
And this is our last year.

53:09.019 --> 53:11.010
Who knows where you'll be
in three months?

53:11.054 --> 53:13.682
Exactly.

53:14.591 --> 53:16.149
Who knows?

53:18.261 --> 53:21.094
So, I guess I'll just...

53:21.164 --> 53:23.029
...see you when I see you?

53:24.267 --> 53:25.529
Yeah.

53:28.138 --> 53:29.503
OK.

53:36.346 --> 53:38.439
Your hand's really warm.

53:55.031 --> 53:56.965
All I think about is you.

53:57.033 --> 53:59.661
All I think about is you, too.

54:23.593 --> 54:25.356
Where did you come from?

54:27.897 --> 54:30.297
All right, Mom! I got it!

54:38.908 --> 54:41.001
- I, uh...
- Yeah, I should go.

54:50.620 --> 54:51.598
Bye.

55:50.213 --> 55:53.341
John! In here.

55:56.286 --> 55:57.913
So, what are you?

56:00.457 --> 56:03.654
You threw those football players
around like it was nothing.

56:03.693 --> 56:07.561
And the hand thing?
That's not human.

56:07.630 --> 56:10.929
So I'm asking you, what are you?

56:13.570 --> 56:15.128
Do I need to threaten you?

56:15.205 --> 56:17.571
All right, 'cause I got
some pictures on my phone,

56:17.640 --> 56:19.039
and they're gonna start
some major questions.

56:19.075 --> 56:21.043
- Give me that.
- No.

56:21.077 --> 56:23.409
You know I can hurt you. Hm?

56:39.929 --> 56:42.159
Knock yourself out.

56:49.339 --> 56:52.365
My entire childhood...

56:53.443 --> 56:55.070
...has been an episode of <i>X- Files.</i>

56:58.081 --> 57:00.572
You know what it's like
to feel something...

57:01.684 --> 57:04.448
...so strong...

57:04.487 --> 57:06.421
...that every day you have
to keep telling yourself

57:06.456 --> 57:09.584
your dad's gonna come back
and take you away from this shithole.

57:09.626 --> 57:12.322
And that everything
we believed in was true.

57:12.395 --> 57:14.863
And that we were not crazy.

57:19.269 --> 57:20.293
Please.

57:25.708 --> 57:27.198
Please.

57:30.814 --> 57:32.145
Your dad was right.

57:33.917 --> 57:35.145
What?

57:41.291 --> 57:42.849
He was right.

57:45.195 --> 57:47.425
About ancient astronauts...

57:48.398 --> 57:50.958
...life on other planets...

57:53.269 --> 57:54.566
...all of it.

57:58.942 --> 58:02.469
Yes! I knew... I knew he
wouldn't just leave us!

58:02.512 --> 58:06.471
I mean, they found his truck near the
border of Mexico, and he was just gone.

58:06.516 --> 58:08.347
- Maybe they took him.
- Sam...

58:08.418 --> 58:10.716
If he knew you were here,
he'd come home.

58:10.787 --> 58:14.120
- You can't tell anyone.
- No, I-I-I wouldn't.

58:14.157 --> 58:16.352
No, no, no. You gotta promise me.
Nobody knows this.

58:16.426 --> 58:20.556
There are others from where I'm from
looking for me.

58:20.630 --> 58:22.928
I'm not safe.

58:22.999 --> 58:27.936
Sam! I know you are in there.
Get your ass in the house, now!

58:29.038 --> 58:30.471
Wait until I get inside and then go.

58:30.507 --> 58:32.236
Sam?

58:34.244 --> 58:35.472
I promise.

58:38.047 --> 58:40.743
Yes!

58:43.820 --> 58:45.344
Come on.

58:59.836 --> 59:01.736
Hey, you maniac.

59:01.804 --> 59:05.171
- Hello, son.
- Hey, what's with the, uh...?

59:09.612 --> 59:10.601
Hello, Dad.

59:10.680 --> 59:12.739
Sheriff James says
some boys got hurt last night.

59:12.815 --> 59:14.874
Couple of them
spent the night in the hospital.

59:14.918 --> 59:16.408
- You said it was four?
- Yeah, four.

59:16.486 --> 59:19.512
- On the football team.
- Yeah, that's right.

59:19.556 --> 59:23.890
Of course, none of them are talking.
That includes my own boy, Mark.

59:25.595 --> 59:29.725
- Your son is Mark?
- Yeah, that's right.

59:29.766 --> 59:31.791
You know, that was his
throwing arm that got hurt.

59:31.868 --> 59:33.859
He said you were there.

59:36.105 --> 59:38.596
Uh, no. I was actually with a girl.

59:38.641 --> 59:42.737
So I wasn't paying any attention.
Um...

59:42.779 --> 59:43.803
Sarah Hart?

59:47.517 --> 59:52.079
Well, no one wants to be the first
one to say what really happened.

59:52.121 --> 59:55.613
But, eventually, someone will.

59:55.658 --> 59:58.354
I'm sure you're right.
Thank you, Sheriff.

59:58.428 --> 1:00:00.794
If we hear anything,
we'll let you know.

1:00:21.017 --> 1:00:23.679
- Four of them, huh?
- Yeah.

1:00:25.288 --> 1:00:27.051
Was it difficult?

1:00:27.924 --> 1:00:29.983
Piece of cake.

1:00:30.026 --> 1:00:32.654
Good. Means you're getting it.

1:00:32.695 --> 1:00:34.720
Go upstairs, pack your stuff.

1:00:34.797 --> 1:00:36.162
Because of last night?

1:00:36.232 --> 1:00:38.826
Because I don't like people
showing up asking questions.

1:00:38.901 --> 1:00:41.927
- And I think this is gonna raise a few.
- "They walk among us."

1:00:41.971 --> 1:00:43.871
What is this? Some more
"truth is out there" freaks?

1:00:43.940 --> 1:00:46.841
Except that's actually you.

1:00:46.909 --> 1:00:49.070
One of the kids must
have caught you on video.

1:00:49.145 --> 1:00:50.544
Oh, shit.

1:00:50.613 --> 1:00:52.672
<i>He's some kind of freak!</i>

1:00:52.715 --> 1:00:54.012
I can't get through the firewall.

1:00:54.050 --> 1:00:55.847
We have to go there
and take it down ourselves.

1:00:55.918 --> 1:00:58.045
Mogs see this, just a matter of time.

1:00:58.121 --> 1:01:00.419
Pack your stuff. We're leaving.

1:01:01.791 --> 1:01:03.554
I'm not going.

1:01:04.927 --> 1:01:06.724
I'm sorry, what did you say?

1:01:07.830 --> 1:01:09.491
I'm not going.

1:01:09.532 --> 1:01:12.763
OK. If you want to pick
the next place, that's fine...

1:01:12.835 --> 1:01:14.530
It's not my fight and it never was!

1:01:14.604 --> 1:01:16.868
I can't even remember
a world before this one.

1:01:16.939 --> 1:01:18.770
Wait, wait...

1:01:18.841 --> 1:01:21.173
...is this because of a girl?

1:01:23.012 --> 1:01:25.003
Go upstairs and get your stuff.

1:01:26.182 --> 1:01:29.379
- You're not my father.
- No, no, no. He's dead.

1:01:29.419 --> 1:01:32.252
He died for you.
In fact, you know what?

1:01:32.321 --> 1:01:36.223
You have no idea how many others
have made sacrifices so you could live!

1:01:36.292 --> 1:01:37.782
And it wasn't so you could come here

1:01:37.860 --> 1:01:40.021
and experience puppy love
like a real live boy!

1:01:40.063 --> 1:01:41.758
I'm not leaving.

1:01:44.567 --> 1:01:47.434
John... John!

1:01:47.503 --> 1:01:48.765
I'm not leaving!

1:01:50.039 --> 1:01:53.600
Oh, yeah, I can do that now.

1:01:59.882 --> 1:02:01.042
Hey, John!

1:02:12.028 --> 1:02:14.462
I'm letting go, OK?

1:02:15.598 --> 1:02:17.361
- OK?
- OK.

1:02:28.344 --> 1:02:31.438
- On our planet...
- Just tell me why they want to kill me.

1:02:31.481 --> 1:02:35.975
The Mogs, they don't colonize.
They decimate. And then they move on.

1:02:36.052 --> 1:02:38.748
And now, they've moved here.

1:02:38.788 --> 1:02:43.725
There are few forces that can stop them.
You and the other five can.

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:45.421
You were saved for a bigger purpose.

1:02:45.461 --> 1:02:49.124
I'm not gonna let you throw that away
for a girl.

1:02:49.165 --> 1:02:51.633
She's not just a girl.

1:02:54.170 --> 1:02:56.297
I think about leaving her...

1:02:56.939 --> 1:02:58.930
...but I can't.

1:02:58.975 --> 1:03:01.409
And I don't know why.

1:03:05.381 --> 1:03:09.283
We don't love like the humans.
With us, it's forever.

1:03:13.389 --> 1:03:15.220
You never forget.

1:03:17.727 --> 1:03:22.164
If she is that for you,
then don't let them win.

1:03:22.198 --> 1:03:24.564
Or you'll never forgive yourself.

1:03:27.670 --> 1:03:28.694
Now, we have to go.

1:03:30.006 --> 1:03:32.668
I'll take care of the website tonight.
Buy you a day.

1:03:32.742 --> 1:03:36.576
A day? To say goodbye?

1:03:36.646 --> 1:03:38.876
That's more than the rest of us had.

1:03:57.366 --> 1:03:59.266
<i>He's some kind of freak!</i>

1:04:09.879 --> 1:04:12.575
Henri, I'm going to Sarah's.

1:04:16.519 --> 1:04:17.543
Henri?

1:04:38.841 --> 1:04:41.605
Henri? Hello? Henri?

1:04:41.677 --> 1:04:46.307
<i>No, but come here</i>
<i>and I'll tell you how to find him.</i>

1:04:46.382 --> 1:04:48.179
Who are you? Where's Henri?

1:04:48.217 --> 1:04:51.118
<i>417 Willard Court,</i>
<i>Warsaw, Indiana.</i>

1:05:01.931 --> 1:05:04.229
Come on, come on.

1:05:04.267 --> 1:05:05.791
I need your help.

1:05:10.973 --> 1:05:12.804
So, you guys... you guys don't...

1:05:12.875 --> 1:05:15.207
- Abduct people?
- Yeah.

1:05:15.244 --> 1:05:16.268
No.

1:05:16.312 --> 1:05:19.770
But the other guys,
the ones that are chasing you...

1:05:19.849 --> 1:05:21.009
...they do?

1:05:42.405 --> 1:05:43.895
That's it.

1:05:45.775 --> 1:05:47.106
Thanks.

1:05:54.884 --> 1:05:57.375
Whoa! You brought a gun?

1:05:57.453 --> 1:06:00.445
I stole it from Ed.
It might come in handy. Let's go.

1:06:00.523 --> 1:06:03.856
- No.
- Dude, I came here to help you.

1:06:03.926 --> 1:06:07.453
You have. Now, go home.

1:06:25.715 --> 1:06:27.376
Whoa!

1:06:30.119 --> 1:06:32.178
- What are you doing?
- I'm not bailing.

1:06:32.254 --> 1:06:33.983
What if these Mog people took my dad?

1:07:06.022 --> 1:07:10.459
Holy shit!

1:07:10.526 --> 1:07:12.687
But you just dead-bolted it.

1:07:14.196 --> 1:07:16.892
- OK. New plan.
- Yeah.

1:07:16.966 --> 1:07:20.060
You follow that guy and you
text me if he comes back, OK?

1:07:20.102 --> 1:07:21.933
Copy that. I'm on it.

1:08:56.165 --> 1:08:57.189
Henri.

1:09:11.647 --> 1:09:13.444
- Are you OK?
- You're not supposed to be here.

1:09:13.482 --> 1:09:15.643
- What happened?
- The Mogs set this up.

1:09:15.684 --> 1:09:18.517
We need to leave. They're coming.

1:09:18.554 --> 1:09:21.523
Everybody stays right where they are
or I'll shoot this kid.

1:09:21.557 --> 1:09:24.151
I'll do it!
Get your hands up!

1:09:24.193 --> 1:09:25.490
So glad you brought the gun.

1:09:26.862 --> 1:09:28.193
You're Malcolm's boy.

1:09:29.532 --> 1:09:32.797
- Get the lights, will you?
- Shut up! Get your hands up!

1:09:38.674 --> 1:09:39.698
Oh!

1:09:44.847 --> 1:09:48.374
You! You're the one
from the video on our site.

1:09:48.450 --> 1:09:51.510
- The one they're after.
- The one who's after?

1:09:51.554 --> 1:09:54.352
- What's he talking about?
- The Mogs, they've been here.

1:09:54.390 --> 1:09:55.721
- This was a trap.
- Yeah.

1:09:55.791 --> 1:09:59.227
These dudes, whatever they are, man,
they got plans, know what I'm sayin'?

1:09:59.261 --> 1:10:01.559
- John...
- I'm that guy, the conspiracy guy.

1:10:01.597 --> 1:10:04.532
Nobody gives a crap what I say.
But this is real, man!

1:10:04.567 --> 1:10:05.966
John. It's time to leave.

1:10:06.035 --> 1:10:09.732
They like it here, Earth. They're gonna
take all this shit, everything!

1:10:09.805 --> 1:10:11.102
John! Now!

1:10:11.173 --> 1:10:13.198
We either do what they say
or we are all gonna die.

1:10:13.242 --> 1:10:15.710
It's time to go! Now!

1:10:31.694 --> 1:10:34.788
John. John! John, no!

1:11:09.231 --> 1:11:11.096
John, go!

1:11:11.133 --> 1:11:12.600
- Now!
- Go!

1:11:38.761 --> 1:11:41.286
Start the car.
Come on! Get us out of here!

1:11:41.330 --> 1:11:43.025
- I can't find the keys!
- What do you mean?

1:11:43.098 --> 1:11:45.589
- I can't find the keys!
- Come on! Come on!

1:11:46.435 --> 1:11:48.665
Guys, what are we waiting for?

1:11:50.506 --> 1:11:52.406
- I've lost the keys!
- John, start the engine.

1:11:52.474 --> 1:11:55.602
- What?
- You can do it. Start the car.

1:11:58.380 --> 1:12:00.610
- Come on.
- Start the car.

1:12:07.356 --> 1:12:09.551
Whoa, whoa. Come on, come on!
He's coming! He's coming!

1:12:09.625 --> 1:12:11.024
Start the car! Start the car!

1:12:11.060 --> 1:12:13.961
Use your magic powers!
Come on! We are so dead!

1:12:15.464 --> 1:12:18.024
Oh, my God!

1:12:22.004 --> 1:12:24.234
Go! Drive the car!

1:12:35.851 --> 1:12:37.546
You take this.

1:12:42.891 --> 1:12:45.359
Malcolm was using it
to track the others.

1:12:45.394 --> 1:12:48.659
- Wait. So, my dad was...
- He was helping us.

1:12:48.697 --> 1:12:50.892
He was supposed to bring us together.

1:12:52.701 --> 1:12:54.032
You need to find the others.

1:12:54.970 --> 1:12:56.460
Together you'll be more powerful.

1:13:09.017 --> 1:13:10.917
I can't do this without you.

1:13:13.021 --> 1:13:14.283
Yes, you can.

1:13:15.991 --> 1:13:17.686
Yes, you can.

1:13:19.795 --> 1:13:23.754
You have no idea
what you're capable of.

1:13:30.005 --> 1:13:31.029
Henri.

1:14:26.995 --> 1:14:28.428
Just let me talk.

1:14:30.098 --> 1:14:32.760
OK. So, I called you like you said.

1:14:34.670 --> 1:14:37.036
I mean, it's not my fault they got...

1:14:38.807 --> 1:14:40.798
I mean, we held up our end.

1:14:40.843 --> 1:14:43.334
- Hm.
- We're still in?

1:14:43.412 --> 1:14:46.711
The whole new world order thing?

1:14:46.782 --> 1:14:50.775
The Locator.

1:14:50.819 --> 1:14:53.481
- Where is it?
- OK.

1:14:53.522 --> 1:14:57.686
All he had was a knife and that rock.

1:14:59.027 --> 1:15:00.119
And I put it...

1:15:02.231 --> 1:15:06.600
- It was over there, man.
- "It was over there, man."

1:15:06.668 --> 1:15:08.727
But it's not there now.

1:15:30.993 --> 1:15:35.225
Cartoons for children.

1:15:35.264 --> 1:15:37.858
Where I'm from, men have to work.

1:15:37.900 --> 1:15:39.765
Look, I'll work hard.

1:15:39.835 --> 1:15:43.498
The disregard that so many of you
have for practical matters,

1:15:43.539 --> 1:15:48.101
it's... beautiful.

1:15:48.176 --> 1:15:50.303
I think we should
all have some fun. Huh?

1:15:52.247 --> 1:15:55.307
Gadgets.
You call them "toys for boys."

1:15:56.852 --> 1:15:58.615
I have a gadget.

1:15:58.687 --> 1:16:02.555
- Would you like to play with it?
- Uh... No, no. I...

1:16:02.591 --> 1:16:06.994
It wants to play with you!

1:16:20.642 --> 1:16:21.904
Need to talk to you.

1:16:21.944 --> 1:16:23.935
Any idea where
I might find your friend?

1:16:23.979 --> 1:16:26.607
He's not who you think he is.

1:16:26.648 --> 1:16:28.479
Excuse me?

1:16:33.956 --> 1:16:35.548
<i>The Paradise Sheriff's Department</i>

1:16:35.591 --> 1:16:37.286
<i>raided the home of two suspects,</i>

1:16:37.326 --> 1:16:40.090
<i>seizing computers</i>
<i>and several suspicious items.</i>

1:16:40.128 --> 1:16:43.461
<i>An APB has been issued on</i>
<i>the suspects and anyone with...</i>

1:16:46.935 --> 1:16:48.459
We need to get out of here.

1:16:50.238 --> 1:16:51.933
There's a news thing.

1:16:51.974 --> 1:16:55.137
The cops think you and Henri
are criminals or terrorists.

1:17:05.887 --> 1:17:07.479
We're going back.

1:17:10.692 --> 1:17:12.660
I'm outside of
the home here in Warsaw

1:17:12.694 --> 1:17:15.857
where the mutilated bodies of
two paranormal website operators

1:17:15.931 --> 1:17:17.956
were just found a few hours ago.

1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:19.797
The police are not saying
if they have any leads

1:17:19.835 --> 1:17:22.201
or even why these
brutal murders occurred.

1:17:22.270 --> 1:17:24.602
Police have no suspects
at this time...

1:17:35.317 --> 1:17:36.807
- I have one of those!
- What?

1:17:36.852 --> 1:17:39.616
One of those.
I took it from my dad's stash.

1:17:39.655 --> 1:17:41.850
- I need you to get it.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:17:41.923 --> 1:17:45.415
Let me off at Linndale.
Sarah's at a house up there.

1:17:45.494 --> 1:17:47.428
I'll call you after.

1:17:47.496 --> 1:17:49.862
- And then what?
- Then I get the rock and you go home.

1:18:00.909 --> 1:18:03.036
- It's him.
- John?

1:18:03.645 --> 1:18:06.978
- Did you see that?
- What's he doing here?

1:18:08.550 --> 1:18:09.676
Yeah, he's here.

1:18:14.423 --> 1:18:15.583
That's him!

1:18:31.973 --> 1:18:33.600
Come on.

1:18:35.110 --> 1:18:36.270
Come on.

1:18:59.201 --> 1:19:01.692
Doesn't seem like your kind of crowd.

1:19:04.606 --> 1:19:07.769
Not so sure who my
kind of crowd is right now.

1:19:07.809 --> 1:19:10.403
- Look, just...
- John Smith?

1:19:10.445 --> 1:19:12.379
I'm such an idiot.

1:19:13.749 --> 1:19:16.980
And they're saying that your dad
is some kind of terrorist.

1:19:17.052 --> 1:19:19.179
He's not a terrorist.

1:19:19.788 --> 1:19:21.187
Tell me the truth.

1:19:22.157 --> 1:19:24.387
Who are you?

1:19:34.836 --> 1:19:36.098
He's upstairs.

1:19:36.938 --> 1:19:38.735
All right, guys, out of the way.

1:19:40.709 --> 1:19:42.939
You didn't answer my question.

1:19:43.812 --> 1:19:45.439
I just came to say goodbye.

1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:47.448
- John, wait! What are you... No, John!
- Don't move!

1:19:47.482 --> 1:19:49.882
Sarah!

1:19:59.094 --> 1:20:00.118
How...

1:20:00.162 --> 1:20:01.629
- Move! Move!
- Go!

1:20:17.312 --> 1:20:18.973
That was awesome!

1:20:19.014 --> 1:20:22.450
Whoa...

1:20:28.089 --> 1:20:29.989
What you did is not possible.

1:20:30.025 --> 1:20:31.549
Who I am...

1:20:31.626 --> 1:20:33.594
...it's all in here.
I took these for you.

1:20:33.662 --> 1:20:37.393
Wait. Come with me.
Please.

1:20:38.333 --> 1:20:40.699
Any idea where they'd be?

1:20:40.769 --> 1:20:43.203
I think I know
where she might go.

1:20:53.248 --> 1:20:56.684
- Who the hell are they?
- Big-ass linebackers?

1:21:04.993 --> 1:21:07.188
Holy shit...

1:21:11.199 --> 1:21:12.962
No, no, no!

1:21:15.670 --> 1:21:16.762
Dad!

1:21:29.251 --> 1:21:33.085
An alcohol-fuelled
young guy like you...

1:21:33.154 --> 1:21:36.988
...healthy and well-fed.

1:21:37.058 --> 1:21:40.653
I bet you watch a lot of television,
don't you? Do you? Do you?

1:21:40.729 --> 1:21:42.924
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:21:42.964 --> 1:21:45.524
In this situation here,
you're probably thinking,

1:21:45.567 --> 1:21:48.764
"Maybe I could save the day.
Maybe I could be the hero."

1:21:48.837 --> 1:21:53.069
But I say... don't do that.

1:21:53.108 --> 1:21:54.803
OK?

1:21:56.511 --> 1:21:59.742
Tell me now, where is the boy?

1:22:27.309 --> 1:22:29.834
These are beautiful.

1:22:44.459 --> 1:22:45.983
Can you show me?

1:23:13.822 --> 1:23:16.188
- No!
- Get in!

1:23:20.395 --> 1:23:23.887
Let me go! Let me go!

1:23:28.670 --> 1:23:29.898
Let go of me!

1:23:37.479 --> 1:23:39.379
- Hello?
- Where are you?

1:23:39.414 --> 1:23:40.506
I'm at the high school.

1:23:40.548 --> 1:23:42.311
<i>Yeah, you need to get out of there now.</i>

1:23:42.350 --> 1:23:43.374
Why? What's happening?

1:23:43.418 --> 1:23:46.216
Your stunt with the car
is already on YouTube.

1:23:46.287 --> 1:23:47.686
<i>If they're not right on your ass now,</i>

1:23:47.722 --> 1:23:49.451
<i>they will be soon.</i>

1:23:50.025 --> 1:23:51.390
Come on.

1:23:51.426 --> 1:23:53.587
And don't tell me this is not my fight.

1:23:53.661 --> 1:23:58.098
My dad probably knew those guys were
coming and that's why they took him.

1:23:58.733 --> 1:24:01.725
And also, I have your dog.

1:24:02.570 --> 1:24:03.730
<i>Look, I'm on my way.</i>

1:24:03.772 --> 1:24:05.262
<i>I'll meet you out front of the school.</i>

1:24:05.340 --> 1:24:07.205
<i>You've got to get out now.</i>

1:24:07.776 --> 1:24:09.368
<i>John?</i>

1:24:09.411 --> 1:24:10.469
<i>John!</i>

1:24:15.116 --> 1:24:16.447
Let's go.

1:24:20.021 --> 1:24:23.252
Let go of me!

1:24:27.228 --> 1:24:29.753
Jesus!

1:24:29.798 --> 1:24:33.598
Sarah! If you're in there, run!

1:24:33.668 --> 1:24:36.398
Run!

1:24:39.941 --> 1:24:42.910
Let me go!

1:24:48.750 --> 1:24:51.651
Listen to me. I'm not gonna
let them hurt you, OK?

1:24:51.719 --> 1:24:54.381
Do you understand me?
Come on.

1:26:08.163 --> 1:26:11.155
Lt'd be a good idea, cowboy, if you
kept your heroics off the Internet.

1:26:13.501 --> 1:26:17.733
- Who are you?
- Number Six. Where's your protector?

1:26:17.805 --> 1:26:21.206
- Dead.
- Yeah. Mine, too.

1:26:21.242 --> 1:26:22.675
Mogs got her four months ago.

1:26:22.710 --> 1:26:25.270
- We've been tracking them down.
- Tracking them?

1:26:25.346 --> 1:26:27.576
Yeah. Lucky for you, I saved your ass.

1:26:27.649 --> 1:26:29.879
You should be watching your own ass.

1:26:29.918 --> 1:26:32.216
Mogs have all the exits covered.

1:26:32.253 --> 1:26:35.245
Looks like you're gonna
have to fight to get out.

1:26:35.323 --> 1:26:37.553
- Are you game?
- Yeah.

1:26:37.592 --> 1:26:40.026
There's a tunnel under the school
that leads to the stadium.

1:26:40.061 --> 1:26:42.825
Oh, you made friends.
How nice.

1:26:44.899 --> 1:26:46.196
Let's go.

1:26:47.468 --> 1:26:50.062
Got any other legacies
I should know about?

1:26:50.138 --> 1:26:51.696
Stay tuned.

1:27:23.871 --> 1:27:26.339
Oh, shit.

1:27:33.781 --> 1:27:35.214
Oh, shit!

1:27:44.959 --> 1:27:46.790
Careful, they'll see us.

1:27:48.096 --> 1:27:49.996
And you're going
to need all your energy.

1:27:54.102 --> 1:27:57.094
- What was that?
- They're comin'.

1:27:57.138 --> 1:27:59.606
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:27:59.641 --> 1:28:02.132
Whoa! Sam, what are you doing?

1:28:02.210 --> 1:28:03.575
Did you see what just
flew out of that truck?

1:28:03.611 --> 1:28:05.806
And your dog just shape-shifted
into one of them.

1:28:05.880 --> 1:28:09.008
I thought he was gonna eat me.
Here's your rock.

1:28:11.085 --> 1:28:15.021
Hi! I'm Sam. What's your name?

1:28:16.024 --> 1:28:17.252
Jane Doe.

1:28:17.292 --> 1:28:18.589
That's cool. It's cool.

1:28:18.626 --> 1:28:19.991
So, are you a number, too?

1:28:20.028 --> 1:28:23.020
- Who is this tool?
- Sam, focus.

1:28:23.097 --> 1:28:25.657
What flew out of the truck?

1:28:29.771 --> 1:28:32.331
Come on! Go, go!

1:28:32.373 --> 1:28:35.672
Sam. Come on! Go!

1:28:39.947 --> 1:28:41.710
Come on! Come on!

1:28:44.819 --> 1:28:47.151
Come on!

1:29:47.181 --> 1:29:48.273
Ahh!

1:29:55.923 --> 1:29:58.255
- Hit me.
- What?

1:29:58.326 --> 1:30:00.726
With your lumen.
I need to power-up.

1:30:02.930 --> 1:30:04.295
Hit me!

1:30:15.276 --> 1:30:17.107
Red Bull's for pussies.

1:30:19.447 --> 1:30:21.574
He killed Henri. I want him.

1:30:53.281 --> 1:30:56.341
Ah!

1:30:58.152 --> 1:30:59.551
Four!

1:31:11.766 --> 1:31:13.859
You're good with your hands.

1:31:13.935 --> 1:31:15.903
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1:31:17.405 --> 1:31:21.705
- My dog, he, uh... he just...
- Yeah, he's a chimera.

1:31:21.776 --> 1:31:23.903
He came with you from Lorien.

1:31:23.978 --> 1:31:26.378
Someone had to look after you.

1:32:29.477 --> 1:32:31.570
You brought a gun?
Are you serious?

1:32:31.612 --> 1:32:34.046
- What? It might come in handy.
- This way.

1:32:44.759 --> 1:32:45.783
Go!

1:32:54.769 --> 1:32:56.396
- Take her back to the tunnel!
- Got it! Come on!

1:33:03.744 --> 1:33:05.974
- Holy...!
- Ahh!

1:33:10.585 --> 1:33:11.882
I play a lot of Xbox.

1:33:18.192 --> 1:33:19.216
Oh!

1:33:39.480 --> 1:33:41.641
Oh! Ahh!

1:34:51.485 --> 1:34:55.751
Number Four, I think you
have something I need. Hm?

1:34:57.358 --> 1:35:01.727
Oh, thank you for making
this so nice and easy.

1:35:01.762 --> 1:35:07.029
Think of how quickly we'll finish off
the rest of the planet. It's fantastic!

1:35:07.768 --> 1:35:10.396
Soon, I'll be done with all of you.

1:35:10.438 --> 1:35:12.702
Just relax.

1:35:14.108 --> 1:35:17.874
You can't stop what's coming.
You never could.

1:35:17.912 --> 1:35:20.005
You have...

1:35:20.047 --> 1:35:22.481
...no idea...

1:35:23.684 --> 1:35:25.151
...what I'm capable of.

1:35:41.402 --> 1:35:42.699
Ah!

1:36:39.627 --> 1:36:40.821
John.

1:36:44.098 --> 1:36:45.793
Fireproof?

1:36:46.967 --> 1:36:49.333
I told you to stay tuned.

1:37:18.232 --> 1:37:20.359
All right, give me that.
Come on.

1:37:21.235 --> 1:37:22.463
Thank you.

1:37:53.500 --> 1:37:57.493
Oh. Well, that was disappointing.
So, not a tracking device?

1:37:57.538 --> 1:37:59.597
No, it was.

1:37:59.673 --> 1:38:02.073
- Did you feel that, too?
- Yeah.

1:38:02.142 --> 1:38:05.305
- We know where we need to go.
- Yeah, we can find the others.

1:38:11.552 --> 1:38:14.749
- Here.
- Thank you.

1:38:15.723 --> 1:38:17.588
I hope this doesn't get you in trouble.

1:38:17.625 --> 1:38:22.119
Nah. Stuff goes missing from evidence
all the time.

1:38:22.196 --> 1:38:24.596
My dad won't even know.

1:38:24.632 --> 1:38:27.533
- You want to be heading west now.
- Why?

1:38:27.568 --> 1:38:30.059
Because I told my dad you're going east.

1:38:37.978 --> 1:38:41.880
- Six, Sam's coming with us.
- What?

1:38:42.983 --> 1:38:44.746
- No way.
- He's one of us now.

1:38:44.785 --> 1:38:47.015
We need to find his father.

1:38:50.624 --> 1:38:54.025
You slow us down,
I'll shoot you myself.

1:38:54.094 --> 1:38:56.562
And I believe you.
Could we go now?

1:39:02.536 --> 1:39:04.663
You know, I wouldn't leave
if it wasn't, uh...

1:39:04.738 --> 1:39:07.502
- Safer.
- Yeah.

1:39:07.574 --> 1:39:09.132
I know.

1:39:10.344 --> 1:39:12.812
Really sorry about
what happened with Henri.

1:39:14.081 --> 1:39:15.844
Me, too.

1:39:19.219 --> 1:39:21.710
You know I'll find you again.

1:39:24.024 --> 1:39:27.016
Probably still be here.

1:39:28.228 --> 1:39:29.820
It's the people that make the place.

1:39:30.597 --> 1:39:32.929
- Right?
- Yeah.

1:39:39.273 --> 1:39:43.141
Henri warned me that
we only fall for one person.

1:39:45.346 --> 1:39:46.813
Ever?

1:39:47.648 --> 1:39:49.081
Ever.

1:41:21.875 --> 1:41:24.776
<i>This is the first town</i>
<i>I've left without Henri.</i>

1:41:25.712 --> 1:41:29.170
<i>But it's also the first one</i>
<i>I have a reason to come back to.</i>

1:41:30.551 --> 1:41:34.043
<i>Henri was right,</i>
<i>we're stronger together.</i>

1:41:34.588 --> 1:41:37.182
<i>So we will find the others.</i>

1:41:39.426 --> 1:41:44.056
<i>My planet is called Lorien,</i>
<i>but Earth is my home now.</i>

1:41:45.099 --> 1:41:48.796
<i>It's as good a place</i>
<i>as any in the universe.</i>

1:41:48.836 --> 1:41:51.270
<i>And that's how it's going to stay.</i>
