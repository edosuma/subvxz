32:47.433 --> 32:50.069
and kids under 9.

32:50.102 --> 32:52.304
I have a photograph.

32:53.640 --> 32:57.543
Do you --
do you recognize her?

32:57.576 --> 33:01.313
No. And as sorry as I am
to hear about your sister,

33:01.347 --> 33:04.917
I want you to leave,
or I'm calling the police.

33:04.951 --> 33:06.485
Yeah, okay. Hey --

33:06.518 --> 33:08.621
Of course.

33:08.655 --> 33:11.624
Sorry for bothering you.

33:11.658 --> 33:13.960
So, look, if you remember
anything else,

33:13.993 --> 33:15.327
my name's Reed Thompson.

33:15.361 --> 33:18.164
It's in the book.
Of course, Mr. Thompson.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.266
(whispers)
The robe's a nice touch.

33:21.634 --> 33:23.502
(normal voice)
Thank you for your help.

33:28.941 --> 33:32.544
(crying)

33:40.286 --> 33:43.122
(exhales)
I miss her so much.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.658
(exhales)

33:45.692 --> 33:47.994
(cries)

33:48.027 --> 33:49.929
Trapeze class? I mean,
what was she gonna do?

33:49.962 --> 33:52.999
Run off and join
Barnum & Bailey?

33:55.001 --> 33:56.602
(sniffles)

33:56.635 --> 33:59.638
I don't know, I guess I just
didn't know her anymore.

34:02.508 --> 34:05.211
(crying)

34:08.647 --> 34:10.382
(sobbing)

34:21.227 --> 34:22.494
-(humming)
-You all right?

34:22.528 --> 34:24.130
Mnh-mnh.

34:24.163 --> 34:27.133
Uh, nah, man.

34:27.166 --> 34:30.669
Our world ain't on fire
anymore, huh?

34:30.703 --> 34:33.672
Feel like a tiny animal
gnawing at my brain, man.

34:33.706 --> 34:36.375
Yeah, probably best to leave
that out the sales pitch.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.411
Yeah, you right.
(baby crying in distance)

34:39.445 --> 34:42.181
Heard from Leon?

34:42.214 --> 34:44.650
No.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.652
No worries.
He'll come around.

34:46.685 --> 34:49.822
Man, come on.
He always do.

34:49.856 --> 34:53.760
Like that time you bought
the same exact shirt as him.

34:53.793 --> 34:56.996
He always come back and eat pie
at the end of the day, right?

34:57.029 --> 35:00.266
(speaking indistinctly)
FRANKLIN: Eat pie?

35:00.299 --> 35:06.072
(men shouting indistinctly) Yeah, you
know, like, eat pie. Humble pie. Humble.

35:06.105 --> 35:07.706
(cheering)

35:07.740 --> 35:09.008
Oh, you wouldn't know
nothin' about that.

35:09.041 --> 35:10.509
(laughs)

35:10.542 --> 35:13.946
(basketball dribbling,
shouting continues)

35:21.087 --> 35:23.122
You think
they here for us?

35:24.456 --> 35:27.960
(chuckles) Yes, they are.

35:27.994 --> 35:29.528
MAN: Come on, man!

35:29.561 --> 35:31.898
Breakfast time,
ladies and gentlemen.

35:31.931 --> 35:34.166
Who's first?

35:35.734 --> 35:38.304

35:48.647 --> 35:50.416
You fucking piece of shit!

35:50.449 --> 35:52.451

35:52.484 --> 35:56.355
You have the balls to come in
here after running to Daddy?

36:01.794 --> 36:03.529
Look at this place.

36:08.334 --> 36:11.703
You two have really put
your work in, huh?

36:15.641 --> 36:19.545
I'm not sure that this is how
I would've done it, but, uh...

36:23.049 --> 36:24.783
Looks good.

36:27.053 --> 36:29.321
Anyone else here?

36:31.657 --> 36:33.059
Gustavo?

36:35.161 --> 36:37.196
I don't know where he is.

36:40.232 --> 36:42.701
You tell him about
our discussion?

36:47.573 --> 36:49.675
'Cause if I find out
you lied to me again --

36:49.708 --> 36:51.577
He doesn't know anything.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.014
Good.

36:59.318 --> 37:02.354
