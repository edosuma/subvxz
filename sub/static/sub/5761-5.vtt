00:08.260 --> 00:10.030
My name is
melinda gordon.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.840
I'm married.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.570
I live in
a small town.

00:14.110 --> 00:16.059
And I own
an antique shop.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.120
I might be
just like you.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.950
Except that,
from the time I was a little girl,

00:19.950 --> 00:22.140
I knew that I could talk
to the dead.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.670
It's all right,honey.

00:23.677 --> 00:26.161
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

00:26.993 --> 00:29.603
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

00:29.604 --> 00:31.401
and they come
to me for help.

00:34.792 --> 00:38.057
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

00:56.375 --> 00:59.620
That looks great on you.
With a top hat and a whip,fabulous.

00:59.625 --> 01:02.033
If you need help getting out of that,
I'm right over here.

01:02.037 --> 01:03.792
God,I love halloween.

01:03.798 --> 01:06.972
My parents use to make
such a big deal out of it.

01:06.975 --> 01:10.572
When I was a kid,they used to decorate
the house up like this big movie set.

01:10.575 --> 01:11.641
It was so great.

01:11.647 --> 01:12.870
Were your parents
into halloween?

01:13.205 --> 01:15.710
Um,my mother
hated it.

01:15.715 --> 01:17.623
I don't know how
my father felt.

01:17.626 --> 01:18.672
Oh,why not?

01:18.677 --> 01:20.912
He left
when I was little.

01:20.916 --> 01:22.871
- I'm so sorry.
- No,it's ok.

01:22.875 --> 01:26.133
You know what? I think this table
would look nicer next to the window.

01:26.247 --> 01:28.693
- Can you help me?
- Oh,sure.

01:29.708 --> 01:33.312
I love worked here.
It's so sweet decorate like this.

01:33.318 --> 01:35.922
Ah, no problem.

01:35.926 --> 01:41.050
has anyone in your family
died recently?

01:41.055 --> 01:42.113
What?

01:42.116 --> 01:44.633
Your extended family.
It's pretty much intact?

01:44.638 --> 01:47.372
Yeah. Amazingly
long-lived,my family.

01:47.387 --> 01:49.080
Both of my grandmothers
are still alive,

01:49.087 --> 01:51.881
and I have
a great-great uncle who's 102.

01:51.888 --> 01:55.140
Wow. Amazing!
Everyone's still alive.

01:55.146 --> 01:59.201
Hey,do you want to see the great undead lipstick
that I got for halloween?

01:59.206 --> 02:01.212
- Sure.
- Let me show you.

02:03.165 --> 02:06.283
Oh,by the way,I am judging
the pumpkin-carving contest at the school tonight.

02:06.286 --> 02:07.450
You want to come?

02:07.457 --> 02:09.702
I would,but I have
plans with a friend.

02:09.705 --> 02:11.733
Oh,well,friends are good.
The more,the merrier.

02:11.738 --> 02:14.261
She's not in a position
to come,but thanks.

02:14.267 --> 02:15.793
Ok.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.320
I swear
I put it in here.

02:25.466 --> 02:29.101
I don't know why I couldn't just tell her
I was coming here.

02:29.398 --> 02:31.822
I mean,delia's
a really nice person.

02:31.826 --> 02:34.891
She's got
a good sense of humor.

02:35.937 --> 02:38.723
Maybe it's just
kind of hard to talk about.

02:40.406 --> 02:43.333
I miss you
so much,andrea.

02:44.686 --> 02:47.802
You will always be
my best friend.

02:51.005 --> 02:55.142
Save a little piece
of that light for me,ok?

02:57.716 --> 03:04.250
Ghosts! Ghosts!
Ghosts! Ghosts!

03:27.798 --> 03:30.120
- This is wrong.
- What's wrong?

03:30.915 --> 03:32.232
This.

03:32.235 --> 03:33.843
- Who are you?
- This is wrong.

03:35.417 --> 03:37.172
- Where am I?
- Look,I know that you're confused.

03:37.178 --> 03:38.593
It's only been
a couple of months.

03:38.598 --> 03:40.422
- Not me.
- Excuse me?

03:40.425 --> 03:43.373
I can't be here.
I can't be.

03:43.778 --> 03:46.540
Yes,you are here.
I just saw you come out of that grave.

03:46.545 --> 03:48.641
But it's not mine.

03:48.648 --> 03:50.212
Are you saying--

03:50.218 --> 03:53.790
help me. I'm in
the wrong grave.

04:01.897 --> 04:04.121
Can you see us?

04:35.548 --> 04:38.800
So,a cemetery.It seems like
a natural place for a ghost.

04:38.805 --> 04:41.402
No,actually,it's not.
Ghosts get their energy from the living.

04:41.407 --> 04:44.080
There's more ghosts in a shopping mall
than at a cemetery.

04:44.087 --> 04:46.703
That explains
all the lousy parking.

04:47.717 --> 04:49.142
Ghosts tend to go
where the problem lies,

04:49.148 --> 04:51.653
and this ghost's problem
is the cemetery.

04:51.657 --> 04:54.271
How does someone
get buried in the wrong grave?

04:54.276 --> 04:56.472
Hmm. Makes you wonder
what they're doing at those morturaries.

04:56.475 --> 04:58.262
Oh,you don't want
to know that.

04:58.265 --> 04:59.383
No,I really don'T.

04:59.387 --> 05:03.153
So,assuming this guy is right,
does that mean that the wrong body's in his grave?

05:03.157 --> 05:05.352
- Makes sense.
- Then what could I do about it?

05:05.355 --> 05:07.541
Not much,
unless you can find the family.

05:07.546 --> 05:09.690
I mean,they can order
an exhumation.

05:09.695 --> 05:11.783
You're going to need
a lot more evidence than,um,

05:12.105 --> 05:14.112
"I talked to a gst."

05:16.037 --> 05:18.500
Makes you wonder how they didn't know
it was that guy.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.223
The body must have been
pretty messed-up.

05:21.226 --> 05:23.793
Yeah. It was pretty bad.

05:25.126 --> 05:27.430
- Cold?
- No. It's just kind of creepy.

05:27.438 --> 05:31.281
My work is usually on a higher plane.
I'm not so used to the whole dead body thing.

05:32.506 --> 05:35.151
You want to try getting used to
the live body thing?

05:35.746 --> 05:37.693
Ooh,that sounds nice.

05:38.526 --> 05:41.123
I don't want to do
much talking here.

06:04.876 --> 06:06.710
Go. Go!

06:07.088 --> 06:09.593
Go away!
I'm not him!

06:09.597 --> 06:11.280
Stop it!

06:12.168 --> 06:14.060
Excuse me?

06:14.066 --> 06:16.523
Wow,stop this weather!

06:16.527 --> 06:18.992
Something like this happens
every time I come here.

06:18.996 --> 06:21.612
I think it's his way of telling me
he knows I'm here.

06:22.598 --> 06:25.281
That's a really nice way
to think about it.

06:25.955 --> 06:28.333
You look familiar to me.
Have we met?

06:28.338 --> 06:29.942
My name
is melinda gordon.

06:29.946 --> 06:33.082
I own an antique shop in town,
same as it never was.

06:33.085 --> 06:35.031
Yes,I love that place.

06:35.035 --> 06:39.093
I bought a vase there
last year from one of your employees.

06:39.095 --> 06:40.683
Lovely girl.

06:40.688 --> 06:42.300
Yeah.

06:42.306 --> 06:44.343
I'm shelby burris.

06:44.346 --> 06:46.450
And this is
my husband steve.

06:46.457 --> 06:47.782
I'm so sorry.

06:47.788 --> 06:50.211
They say it gets
better with time,

06:50.215 --> 06:52.011
but it doesn't seem to.

06:52.015 --> 06:54.621
No,it doesn'T.

06:55.325 --> 06:59.303
He was kind and caring.
He loved to laugh.

06:59.305 --> 07:02.023
He sounds like
a wonderful man.

07:05.058 --> 07:08.162
Were you actually there
when they buried him?

07:08.668 --> 07:12.240
Did you get to say good-bye
and see him one last time.

07:12.247 --> 07:14.190
Only in spirit.

07:14.196 --> 07:18.083
There was so much damage,
it had to be a closed coffin.

07:19.077 --> 07:21.073
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

07:21.078 --> 07:25.322
It's ok. It's better to talk about it
than keep it bottled up inside.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.123
It was nice
to meet you,melinda.

07:30.126 --> 07:32.130
I didn't ask,do you have
a loved one buried here?

07:32.135 --> 07:34.093
Yes.

07:34.097 --> 07:36.490
The lovely girl
from the store.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.580
Oh,I'm so sorry.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.772
Life is so fleeting,
isn't it?

07:42.778 --> 07:46.272
You can be happy,
things are going great,and then...

07:46.277 --> 07:49.903
a sudden bolt of lightning
can wipe it all out.

07:49.908 --> 07:52.322
Yeah,that's true.

07:52.327 --> 07:54.903
Well,life is for
the living,right?

08:26.805 --> 08:28.022
What are you doing here?

08:28.028 --> 08:31.360
That woman. She comes every day.
She cries so hard...

08:31.998 --> 08:33.403
but not for me.

08:33.405 --> 08:35.500
Is that why you're trying
to get rid of her?

08:35.505 --> 08:38.023
She thinks that
you're her husband.

08:39.395 --> 08:40.780
But I'm not.

08:40.788 --> 08:44.320
- Who are you?
- Godfrey.

08:46.018 --> 08:47.972
Adam godfrey.

08:48.726 --> 08:51.190
Do you know
how you died?

08:52.918 --> 08:55.380
It was a flash--

08:55.386 --> 08:57.623
bright,hot.

08:57.627 --> 09:00.332
I just--I don't--
I don't know.

09:00.337 --> 09:02.787
I know that
this is hard,

09:02.787 --> 09:05.821
and you feel really confused right now,
but it's going to get better.

09:06.258 --> 09:09.341
Do you have a family?
Anyone who can help us?

09:09.843 --> 09:13.433
I was alone.
I was always alone.

09:16.684 --> 09:19.231
Find my grave.

09:20.202 --> 09:22.527
Please.

09:44.655 --> 09:47.463
Wow,adam godfrey's
a writer.

09:47.465 --> 09:49.510
What's that?

09:50.225 --> 09:51.893
Oh,sorry. Nothing.

09:51.898 --> 09:54.763
Adam godfrey?
Great writer.

09:54.766 --> 09:57.751
Haven't you
ever read lost delusions?

09:57.756 --> 10:01.253
Honey,I saw you
look right at me yesterday.

10:01.258 --> 10:03.240
Don't pretend
you can't see me now.

10:03.245 --> 10:04.983
I cannot talk.

10:04.987 --> 10:07.712
Sorry. I just had to cash her out.
Did you need me?

10:07.715 --> 10:11.460
No,no. I'm just
looking for this book,lost delusions.

10:11.468 --> 10:14.950
Oh,yeah. Our book club
read that last year. Great book.

10:14.958 --> 10:18.020
But the author was
kind of a one-hit wonder,right?

10:18.026 --> 10:19.730
Well,let's see.

10:19.736 --> 10:23.062
We all read it
3 or 4 times.

10:23.068 --> 10:26.811
We tried to get the country club
to name a sandwich after the main character.

10:26.817 --> 10:31.110
It's about a young man
struggling to find his ace in the world

10:31.116 --> 10:35.073
and failing miserably.
Depressing,yet oddly uplifting.

10:35.076 --> 10:37.360
Yep,that's the one.

10:37.367 --> 10:40.310
I still have it at home,
if you want to borrow it.

10:40.315 --> 10:43.113
By the way,e you hungry?
Because I am starved.

10:43.117 --> 10:46.081
I totally lost track of time.
Please go to lunch. I'll cover for you.

10:46.088 --> 10:50.633
Did you and andrea ever just close up for a bit
and go and have lunch together.

10:51.765 --> 10:53.501
You know what?
I-I can't,

10:53.505 --> 10:56.640
because I have an errand to run,
so maybe some other time.

11:06.567 --> 11:09.611
- Hi.
- Oh. Hi.

11:09.616 --> 11:11.532
What are the chances?
Twice in 2 days.

11:11.535 --> 11:14.113
Well,not so strange for me.
I come every day.

11:14.766 --> 11:16.463
Can I ask you
a question?

11:16.468 --> 11:20.070
Does the name adam godfrey mean
anything to you?

11:20.075 --> 11:21.820
No. Should it?

11:21.826 --> 11:24.660
I just thought maybe he was one of
your husband's friends.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.300
Steve had so many friends.
How would I know him?

11:27.867 --> 11:30.823
Um,he was a writer.
He's passed away now.

11:30.826 --> 11:32.681
Adam godfrey.

11:32.687 --> 11:34.591
I'm sorry.
I don't remember him.

11:34.595 --> 11:37.273
If I do,
I'll let you know.

11:37.277 --> 11:39.693
Can I ask you how
your husband died?

11:39.695 --> 11:43.063
Yeah. I thought I told you.
A bolt of lightning.

11:43.575 --> 11:44.643
What?

11:44.647 --> 11:46.861
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's how he died.

11:46.868 --> 11:49.731
He was struck by lightning.

11:54.625 --> 11:56.551
- Lightning?
- That's what she said,

11:56.555 --> 11:59.813
but my ghost said that he died,
and then there was a big flash of light.

11:59.818 --> 12:00.981
And so?

12:00.985 --> 12:04.623
So,what if they both
died from some sort of electrical shock?

12:04.628 --> 12:07.001
Is it possible that
they're psychically connected in some way,

12:07.007 --> 12:09.141
or that their souls
have swapped bodies?

12:09.147 --> 12:12.520
You know,I never thought
I'd hear myself say this,but that's crazy.

12:12.525 --> 12:15.573
Right. It is.I'm listening
to myself say it,and it sounds crazy.

12:15.918 --> 12:18.022
Then again,why not?
It's almost halloween.

12:18.027 --> 12:21.971
It's true.My grandmother always saidthat the
veil between the living and the dead got thinner around halloween.

12:22.688 --> 12:24.892
The only way
to prove something like that...

12:25.468 --> 12:27.220
would be if you found
where the other body was,right?

12:27.228 --> 12:28.412
Yes,and then I could
talk to the ghost.

12:28.418 --> 12:31.580
But I have searched the internet,
and I can't find anything on adam godfrey's death.

12:31.587 --> 12:32.940
I even checked
with his publishers.

12:32.948 --> 12:34.281
Oh,yeah?
What did they say?

12:34.288 --> 12:36.011
Clueless.
They didn't even know he was dead.

12:36.018 --> 12:37.140
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell them,did you?

12:37.145 --> 12:38.530
How I can I?
I can't prove it.

12:38.535 --> 12:39.623
Tricky.

12:39.625 --> 12:43.071
Now,steve burris,on the other hand,
I did find something on him. His obituary.

12:43.075 --> 12:44.430
And he is nothing
like adam at all.

12:44.438 --> 12:49.152
Listen to this.A staple on the social circuit
with a taste forluxury,adventure,and the good life.

12:50.997 --> 12:54.543
And your guy was a hermit,huh? It's not as
if their paths were to cross very often.

12:54.545 --> 12:56.400
Coming.

12:56.407 --> 12:59.131
Hey,jim. I hope it's
not too late for visitors.

12:59.137 --> 13:00.412
Not at all.

13:00.418 --> 13:01.732
Hey,delia,
come on in.

13:01.737 --> 13:04.970
Oh,I'd love to,but I really just wanted
to drop this book by on my way home.

13:04.977 --> 13:07.452
It's a little dark,
but guess I like that kind of thing.

13:07.455 --> 13:08.383
Me,too. Thanks.

13:08.386 --> 13:10.912
You sure you don't want to stay?
We're about to dig into dessert.

13:10.916 --> 13:14.341
Dessert? I'd die
for something chocolate.

13:14.346 --> 13:17.180
Oh,dear. It sounds
great,but I really should get home.

13:17.188 --> 13:21.232
Ned accidentally agreed
to let me watch a movie that has no murder,

13:21.237 --> 13:23.920
mayhem,or violent
explosions in it,

13:23.926 --> 13:27.642
so I'd like to watch as much of it as I can
before he realizes his mistake.

13:27.647 --> 13:28.863
Boring.

13:28.865 --> 13:30.402
Ok,then.
We'll see you tomorrow.

13:30.406 --> 13:31.870
Ok.

13:32.535 --> 13:34.010
- Hey!
- Are you ok?

13:34.018 --> 13:37.533
Yeah. Gosh,I'm such
a klutz today. Bye.

13:38.125 --> 13:40.081
Can't I just see
what's for dessert?

13:40.088 --> 13:43.032
It's not like I'm worried
about trans fats anymore.

13:43.037 --> 13:46.143
Wait a minute.
Was she accompanied?

13:46.146 --> 13:48.390
Yep. And her ghost
is a chocoholic.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.323
I really don't know what
I'm going to do about that.

13:50.326 --> 13:51.303
I knew it.

13:51.305 --> 13:52.691
Hey,listen
to this dediation--

13:52.698 --> 13:55.931
"to jean,withoutwhose loving support
this book could not have been written."

13:55.936 --> 13:57.323
Sounds like
a wife to me.

13:57.327 --> 14:00.283
You know,he told me
that he was alone-- always alone.

14:00.935 --> 14:03.140
Maybe she abandoned him.

14:03.147 --> 14:05.432
You're a hopeless
romantic,you know that?

14:05.436 --> 14:09.551
Ok. There is a jean godfrey
who owns jean's pet shop in sunset park.

14:09.558 --> 14:10.740
What do you think--
man or a woman?

14:10.747 --> 14:12.133
Only one way to find out.

14:12.138 --> 14:16.283
You know what? It's fun to brainstorm
this stuff with you.

14:16.285 --> 14:18.170
You know,
I read somewhere--

14:18.178 --> 14:20.661
ghostbusting keeps
a marriage strong.

14:37.487 --> 14:41.452
Oh,I can't!
No,I can'T.

14:42.777 --> 14:45.090
Honey,
are you all right?

14:45.095 --> 14:46.573
Oh,yeah. I'm sorry.

14:46.575 --> 14:51.231
I just promised my husband that I wouldn't
come home with something soft and fluffy and--oh.

14:52.226 --> 14:55.462
Oh,yeah. Well,the reptile section's
right over there,if that's any help.

14:55.777 --> 14:58.513
Actually,I am looking
for a human being.

14:58.517 --> 14:59.622
Jean godfrey?

14:59.625 --> 15:01.441
You're looking at her.

15:01.445 --> 15:04.430
Oh,oh,hi.
I'm melinda gordon?

15:05.308 --> 15:07.620
Are you related to
the writer adam godfrey?

15:07.628 --> 15:10.992
Well,if being married
to him counts as related--

15:10.996 --> 15:13.731
- he's your husband?
- Was,long time ago.

15:14.275 --> 15:16.723
I kept the name,though.
So why do you ask?

15:17.386 --> 15:20.550
I'm so sorry.
He's dead.

15:21.107 --> 15:24.491
Oh,ok.

15:25.086 --> 15:26.870
Tony,could you take
the counter,please?

15:26.877 --> 15:27.992
Sure **********

15:27.996 --> 15:30.030
Let's talk outside.

15:31.817 --> 15:34.681
Sorry,but I really
have to do this.

15:34.687 --> 15:37.440
I'm not going to light it,
I just go through the motions.

15:37.447 --> 15:38.902
Quitting's a bitch.

15:38.906 --> 15:40.033
That's what I hear.

15:40.035 --> 15:42.081
So adam's dead.

15:42.085 --> 15:43.641
How'd it happen.

15:43.645 --> 15:46.512
There was an accident.
I don't have all the details.

15:46.517 --> 15:47.700
You the girlfriend?

15:47.708 --> 15:50.972
No. I just met
him recently.

15:50.975 --> 15:53.760
He told me that
he'd always been alone.

15:53.765 --> 15:56.182
Well,I guess he kind
of was,actually,

15:56.188 --> 15:59.102
even when we
were married.

15:59.665 --> 16:02.390
Yeah. It was really good
at first. It was just--

16:02.398 --> 16:05.341
he was kind of
a hard guy to get close to.

16:05.348 --> 16:08.351
So I assume you've read
lost delusions.

16:08.356 --> 16:10.193
It was pretty much
the story of his life.

16:10.196 --> 16:14.952
Tourtured young guy too smart for
his own good,doesn't really fit in.

16:14.955 --> 16:17.780
I guess I thought that I was going to be the one
to bring him in from the cold.

16:18.408 --> 16:22.120
You know what?Don't ever think that you can save
those tortured young artists.

16:22.128 --> 16:25.471
I think that they actually like being tortured.
It's what makes them artists.

16:26.587 --> 16:28.371
He was successful
for a while,though,right?

16:28.376 --> 16:32.071
Oh,yeah. When lost delusions came
out,it was a big deal.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.411
And then his second novel
came out.

16:34.415 --> 16:36.372
Critics had
a feeding frenzy.

16:36.378 --> 16:38.183
Adam was devastated

16:38.187 --> 16:42.470
and he said he needed to move to the cabin
to have some isolation to write.

16:43.055 --> 16:48.111
At first,he came home every weekend,
then once a month,and then there was the talk.

16:49.956 --> 16:52.420
The one where you know
it's all over.

16:52.428 --> 16:56.331
If you want someone reliable,
you get yourself a pet.

16:56.926 --> 16:58.802
Thanks for the advice.

16:58.808 --> 17:01.461
Yeah. Thank you
for letting me know about this.

17:04.627 --> 17:07.051
Oh,man.

17:07.057 --> 17:09.863
This is going to be really hard
for kate to hear.

17:09.866 --> 17:12.002
- Kate?
- His daughter.

17:12.008 --> 17:14.359
Yeah. Death can be hard
to explain to children.

17:14.676 --> 17:17.053
Well,she's hardly a child.
She's a junior at state U.

17:17.056 --> 17:19.903
She hasn't seen or heard from her father
since she was 3.

17:21.126 --> 17:22.561
- 3?
- She'd never admit it,

17:22.567 --> 17:25.970
but I think that she always thought
that she'd see him again.

17:25.977 --> 17:28.830
Hell,maybe even get
an explanation.

17:29.237 --> 17:32.031
Well,that's not going
to happen now,is it?

17:32.035 --> 17:34.071
Well,thanks. I just--

17:34.078 --> 17:36.242
I wanted
to let you know.

17:44.225 --> 17:47.660
- What are you doing here?
- I'm not sure.

17:47.668 --> 17:50.692
I feel like I'm near
something that used to be important.

17:50.696 --> 17:52.172
I need to talk to you.

17:53.848 --> 17:56.102
Why didn't you tell me
that you had a wife and daughter?

17:56.105 --> 17:57.880
A wife and daughter?

17:57.886 --> 18:00.851
No,I didn't have
a wife and...

18:01.415 --> 18:03.572
oh,my god.

18:03.576 --> 18:06.331
Jean and kate.

18:06.337 --> 18:09.341
Yeah,jean and kate,
who you abandoned when she was 3.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.231
- Why would I do that?
- That's what I'd like to know.

18:14.236 --> 18:18.793
All I know is I had a lot of demons.
It was hard being around people.

18:18.796 --> 18:21.020
I think I felt that I wasn't good
for either of them.

18:21.025 --> 18:21.983
So you ditched them?

18:21.985 --> 18:25.363
No,I freed them
to lead happier
lives without me. lives without me.

18:26.785 --> 18:28.221
- What?
- That's classic.

18:28.228 --> 18:30.561
- You don't understand--
- no,you don't understand.

18:30.568 --> 18:34.473
How do you think your daughter felt when she had
to watch you walk out of her life forever?

18:34.475 --> 18:36.271
Free? You're her father.

18:36.278 --> 18:38.100
It was complicated.
I'm not proud of it--

18:38.105 --> 18:40.221
good,'cause
you don't deserve to be happy.

18:40.228 --> 18:42.691
You deserve to be exactly where you are--
in the wrong grave,

18:42.698 --> 18:45.642
doomed to listen to a woman grieve
a good man,knowing that he isn't you.

19:02.357 --> 19:05.860
So anyway,I'm standing in this alley,
and I'm yelling at this ghost.

19:05.867 --> 19:08.313
Why did I let myself
get so emotional?

19:08.815 --> 19:09.720
Not gonna read it,huh?

19:09.725 --> 19:11.750
I don't want anything
to do with this ghost.

19:11.756 --> 19:15.073
Why would I help someone who would run out
on his family,abandoning his child?

19:17.095 --> 19:19.030
Whose family are we
talking about now?

19:19.038 --> 19:22.080
Ok,I admit it,I have a personal thing
going on here. So what?

19:22.088 --> 19:25.113
So nothing.
Just know where it's coming from.

19:25.115 --> 19:28.400
And then he had the nerve to expect me
to make it right for him.

19:28.408 --> 19:31.482
In his defense,there aren't too
many other people he could go to.

19:31.487 --> 19:32.890
You're defending him?

19:32.897 --> 19:35.383
I'm pointing out you're a little
emotional right now.

19:36.055 --> 19:38.832
I don't have to help every ghost
that comes along. It's my call,right?

19:38.835 --> 19:41.741
I mean,you've
heard me tell ghosts to leave me alone.

19:42.685 --> 19:44.291
Only when you thought
you couldn't help them.

19:44.296 --> 19:45.560
You really think
I can help this one?

19:45.566 --> 19:48.862
Yeah,I do.
And I think you do,too.

19:50.907 --> 19:53.610
I can't talk about this right now.
I have a headache.

20:03.086 --> 20:05.501
Ooh,that's fabulous.

20:06.598 --> 20:08.052
Is it for sale?

20:08.055 --> 20:10.360
Oh,no,I'm sorry.
It's mine.

20:10.366 --> 20:12.931
Lucy and ethel
would die for that bag.

20:12.935 --> 20:14.601
May I?

20:14.607 --> 20:16.410
Oh,sure.

20:17.226 --> 20:18.712
There you go.

20:19.645 --> 20:22.642
Careful with that clasp,
liberace. You trying to break it?

20:23.965 --> 20:27.342
Ow. There must be
a pin sticking out of it somewhere.

20:27.346 --> 20:29.690
I don't see it.

20:29.698 --> 20:33.120
Ok. Thank you so much,
and please come back again soon.

20:33.128 --> 20:35.722
I will.
You girls have great taste.

20:38.357 --> 20:41.621
That really is a nice bag.
I haven't noticed it before.

20:41.627 --> 20:44.922
Yeah. I got it
a couple of days ago at an estate sale.

20:45.165 --> 20:46.632
Ah. That explains a lot.

20:46.638 --> 20:49.570
You know,there are some figurines in the back.
Could you go and get them for me?

20:49.577 --> 20:51.241
You might have to dig around a little bit.

20:51.246 --> 20:53.451
Sure,no problem.

20:55.146 --> 20:56.232
So it's the bag.

20:56.235 --> 20:59.693
Of course it's the bag.
I don't even know that woman.

20:59.695 --> 21:03.362
- What's your name?
- Marilyn mandeville.

21:03.365 --> 21:05.611
Why are you the only one
who can see me?

21:05.616 --> 21:08.483
It's a long story.
So how did you die,marilyn?

21:08.487 --> 21:10.182
I was at
a charity event,

21:10.186 --> 21:13.722
one of those horrible things
where no one can remember the charity,

21:13.727 --> 21:16.723
but they all sure as hell know where
the photographers are.

21:16.725 --> 21:19.111
Well,I wasn't
in the mood to be in the papers.

21:19.117 --> 21:23.021
I knew I looked all red and blotchy
from crying over luca.

21:23.026 --> 21:25.022
- Luca?
- My boyfriend.

21:25.025 --> 21:28.240
Hot-headed,
bad-tempered,

21:28.246 --> 21:30.222
just this much
dangerous.

21:30.228 --> 21:32.903
All the things
I love in a man.

21:32.906 --> 21:37.160
Anyway,a friend told me
that she saw him out with another woman,

21:37.166 --> 21:38.972
so...

21:38.977 --> 21:40.692
I kicked him out
of the house.

21:41.385 --> 21:43.803
Aha. React first,
ask questions later.

21:43.807 --> 21:46.240
But I loved him.

21:46.906 --> 21:50.160
Anyway,I was just about
to leave the party,

21:50.167 --> 21:52.502
when suddenly I saw him
across the room.

21:52.506 --> 21:54.521
He saw me,too.

21:54.526 --> 21:58.230
He wrote something downon a napkin.
He gave it to a waiter to give to me.

21:58.238 --> 22:01.822
I tell you,my heart was pounding so hard,
I thought everybody could hear it.

22:01.826 --> 22:03.722
Well,what did it say?

22:03.727 --> 22:06.222
I didn't want
to look desperate to read it.

22:06.225 --> 22:09.111
So I tucked it
in my bag.

22:09.118 --> 22:11.463
I finished my drink

22:11.466 --> 22:16.061
and then I practically knocked over tables
and chairs to get outside to read it.

22:16.406 --> 22:17.833
But then--

22:17.838 --> 22:19.100
you died.

22:19.107 --> 22:21.261
Heart attack.

22:24.457 --> 22:27.470
I never got
to read the note.

22:28.295 --> 22:29.781
Marilyn,I hate
to tell you this,

22:29.787 --> 22:32.632
but the chances
of that note still being in the bag--

22:32.635 --> 22:35.653
please,will you
just check?

22:36.877 --> 22:37.713
Melinda?

22:37.715 --> 22:41.193
God! The interruptions
in this place.

22:41.197 --> 22:42.942
Shelby. Hi.

22:42.947 --> 22:46.963
I just had to come by
because the strangest thing happened to me.

22:46.967 --> 22:49.632
You asked me if I knew a man named
adam godfrey,right?

22:49.828 --> 22:51.123
Right.

22:51.126 --> 22:52.993
- Well,he just called me.
- What?

22:52.997 --> 22:55.392
I was just about to have dinner
when the phone rang.

22:55.398 --> 22:58.310
I said hello,but all I heard was
silence and a click.

22:58.317 --> 23:01.980
I looked down at the caller I.D. And
it said adam godfrey.

23:01.985 --> 23:05.322
But didn't you say
that adam godfrey died?

23:05.885 --> 23:07.231
Yes,I did.

23:07.237 --> 23:09.650
That's what I thought,
so I wrote the number down.

23:09.657 --> 23:12.942
Melinda,
you may find this hard to believe,

23:12.948 --> 23:16.322
but I think your friend

23:16.328 --> 23:19.661
is trying to reach you from the afterlife.

23:36.156 --> 23:37.550
I didn't think
you'd come back.

23:37.557 --> 23:39.263
I didn't plan to.

23:39.267 --> 23:40.530
Well,I'm glad
you did.

23:40.536 --> 23:43.640
I have one question
and I want you to be really honest.

23:44.195 --> 23:46.841
How do you walk away
from your family?

23:47.987 --> 23:51.073
You tell yourself
your daughter will never feel the loss.

23:51.076 --> 23:53.671
She won't miss you
because she never knew you.

23:53.676 --> 23:58.090
Your wife will
find love somewhere else and be better off.

23:58.096 --> 24:03.391
You tell yourself that your work will be the thing
that lives on after you,and that's what's important.

24:05.738 --> 24:07.833
Well,maybe you needed
to learn this,adam.

24:07.835 --> 24:10.300
That guy whose grave I'm in...

24:10.308 --> 24:12.273
he was really loved.

24:12.278 --> 24:14.820
He must have been
a good man.

24:14.827 --> 24:16.693
Shelby thought so.

24:16.697 --> 24:18.751
Shelby?

24:18.758 --> 24:22.552
The woman who's been crying at his grave,
the one you called to reach me.

24:23.165 --> 24:25.560
- I--I didn't call that woman.
- You didn't?

24:25.568 --> 24:28.343
Who knew I could even
use a phone? I'm dead.

24:30.325 --> 24:32.561
Does this number look
familiar to you?

24:33.038 --> 24:36.173
That's my phone number
at the cabin.

24:36.177 --> 24:38.182
Do you remember
where this is?

24:38.987 --> 24:40.642
I think so. Why?

24:40.645 --> 24:43.832
Because somebody's in this cabin
and I think we should find out who it is.

24:48.708 --> 24:50.662
Does this road
look familiar to you?

24:51.285 --> 24:52.861
No.

24:53.585 --> 24:55.722
Wait a minute...
yes.

24:57.895 --> 24:59.993
I was here.

25:01.808 --> 25:05.163
It was late at night
and my car had broken down.

25:05.165 --> 25:08.272
No,wait a minute,
I was out of gas.

25:10.575 --> 25:14.132
The guy who picked me up,
he seemed upset about something.

25:14.136 --> 25:18.962
And I asked him about it,
but he wouldn't talk,not until he heard my name.

25:18.967 --> 25:24.132
Turns out that he had read
lost delusions 4 times,

25:24.138 --> 25:26.903
and so he wanted
to know all about me.

25:26.908 --> 25:30.383
I told him I lived in a cabin
miles away from everything.

25:30.387 --> 25:33.170
But I asked him about himself
and he got tense.

25:33.176 --> 25:35.832
"You wouldn't want
my life," he said.

25:35.836 --> 25:39.441
He didn't really know his way around,
so we stopped at a bar.

25:39.446 --> 25:43.483
I remember the bartender said
there was a gas station 3 miles down the road,

25:43.487 --> 25:47.113
but my new friend
said that he wanted a drink,and so did I.

25:49.286 --> 25:53.112
He said he was a businessman
who--who had the golden touch,

25:53.118 --> 25:55.241
at least until lately,

25:55.246 --> 25:57.801
and now things were
going sour,

25:57.808 --> 25:59.662
he couldn't catch a break.

25:59.667 --> 26:05.160
And he got some inside information
about something,like a big merger.

26:05.166 --> 26:08.722
Gambled everything
he had left on it,and it tanked.

26:08.725 --> 26:13.421
Now I remember. He said that his wife
didn't know anything about this.

26:13.427 --> 26:14.520
I can't tell her...

26:14.527 --> 26:18.300
and he said he couldn't stand to see her
have to give up the life that they had.

26:18.307 --> 26:21.980
All that he had left
was this insurance policy.

26:21.987 --> 26:24.823
I'm worth more
dead than alive.

26:26.906 --> 26:31.540
This guy,he was so in love with his wife,
and I just felt empty.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.732
I never loved anyone
like that.

26:33.738 --> 26:35.081
Did he tell you
his name?

26:35.088 --> 26:37.821
Well,if he did,
I don't remember.

26:37.828 --> 26:40.521
Do you think
he killed himself?

26:40.526 --> 26:42.933
Looked like he was
heading that way.

26:42.937 --> 26:46.390
It was starting to rain,

26:46.397 --> 26:49.413
so I decided
to cut my losses and walk.

27:06.228 --> 27:08.003
Help!

27:08.008 --> 27:10.892
Help me! Help!

27:33.846 --> 27:35.341
What are you doing?

27:51.597 --> 27:53.611
And that's
how he became you.

27:53.618 --> 27:57.992
That man,he was the name
on my tombstone.

27:59.866 --> 28:02.992
And I'm guessing
he's in your cabin.

28:02.997 --> 28:03.941
But why would he do that?

28:03.948 --> 28:08.252
Why would he throw away
everything he had,the woman that he loved?

28:08.258 --> 28:11.782
Why not?
It's what you did,wasn't it?

28:31.495 --> 28:33.842
- This is it?
- This is it.

28:36.776 --> 28:38.543
- Yes?
- Who are you?

28:38.546 --> 28:40.691
- Who are you?
- I'm kate godfrey.

28:40.696 --> 28:42.702
Who are you?

28:42.706 --> 28:44.020
My daughter.

28:44.026 --> 28:45.883
You're adam's
daughter.

28:45.885 --> 28:48.441
Put it this way--
he's half the reason I was born.

28:48.446 --> 28:50.021
Second time,who are you?

28:50.027 --> 28:54.372
Sorry. Melinda gorden.
I live in grandview,and I know your father.

28:54.375 --> 28:56.193
You're the one that told
my mother he was dead.

28:56.198 --> 28:57.221
Yes.

28:57.225 --> 29:00.522
Well,that was helpful of you,
considering it's not true.

29:01.666 --> 29:03.673
What does that mean?

29:03.676 --> 29:05.582
Oh,I'm sorry,
can I come in?

29:05.587 --> 29:07.161
It's not my place.

29:07.165 --> 29:10.043
So...what makes you think
that he's not dead?

29:10.676 --> 29:14.243
No accident report,
no body,no obituary.

29:14.245 --> 29:15.643
Do you want me to go on?

29:15.646 --> 29:17.363
No,I'd look
for them,too.

29:17.365 --> 29:20.420
So not finding them
it makes sense you think he's dead.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.850
I know he is.

29:22.855 --> 29:25.252
Look,I know that this is gonna sound
hard to believe--

29:25.257 --> 29:26.353
I'm sure it will.

29:26.357 --> 29:28.201
I've spoken
to your father's spirit.

29:28.876 --> 29:31.290
Oh,wow,
you're one of those.

29:31.296 --> 29:33.461
Please believe me.
It's true.

29:33.466 --> 29:35.803
I know my father attracted
some eccentric fans,

29:35.807 --> 29:38.192
but this takes it
to a whole new level.

29:38.198 --> 29:39.621
Do you know much
about your father?

29:39.627 --> 29:42.091
- No. I've never even read his books.
- Why not?

29:42.095 --> 29:45.132
It was the great god of literature
that made him leave us.

29:45.135 --> 29:47.730
Frankly,I'm not interested.

29:48.186 --> 29:51.711
Kate,your father gave me every detail
about what happened to him the night that he died.

29:51.718 --> 29:53.473
I'd be happy to tell you
if you like.

29:53.478 --> 29:56.153
Do you know what I'd like? Is for you
to leave me alone.

29:56.158 --> 29:58.892
My mother tells me
she hears from you that he's dead.

29:58.897 --> 30:03.121
She asks me to come here and gather his effects,
I come out here and what do I find?

30:03.978 --> 30:05.560
A full fridge.

30:05.567 --> 30:09.352
Cigarettes in the ash tray.
Newly opened mail.

30:09.357 --> 30:11.212
Dead,my ass.

30:11.215 --> 30:13.813
I just hope I can
get out of here before he comes back.

30:13.817 --> 30:18.531
Kate...the man who's been living here,
his name is steve burris.

30:18.536 --> 30:21.311
There was a mix-up the night the night
that your father died and he was mistaken for him,

30:21.317 --> 30:24.153
but your father
is here now.

30:24.157 --> 30:26.810
And he really wants to talk to you
if he can just make some peace.

30:26.815 --> 30:29.761
Are you aware that you aren't even
remotely believable?

30:29.767 --> 30:32.593
Adam,please tell me something that kate
will understand. Help me.

30:32.596 --> 30:36.830
Just that she was such
a beautiful child.

30:37.255 --> 30:39.583
He thought you were
so beautiful.

30:40.076 --> 30:44.223
That's it? Oh,come on. Didn't you
do your research?

30:44.226 --> 30:47.973
The name of my fuzzy bunny,
my favorite pet.

30:47.978 --> 30:51.602
What about a cute nickname?
Come on. Make me weep.

30:52.887 --> 30:54.993
I--I can'T.

30:56.987 --> 30:59.652
He told me before that
the only reason he left

30:59.656 --> 31:01.792
was to free you
from having him as your father.

31:02.295 --> 31:04.663
He didn't feel like
he could give you what you needed,

31:04.666 --> 31:06.510
and that you would
have a better life without him.

31:06.515 --> 31:08.462
Damn straight I did.

31:09.046 --> 31:10.471
Look,I know how you feel.

31:10.476 --> 31:12.441
He did a terrible thing,

31:12.448 --> 31:16.363
and you've thought about him every day
of your life with anger and resentment,I know.

31:16.806 --> 31:18.302
- You know?
- Yes,I do know,

31:18.308 --> 31:22.882
but,kate,for one minute,just--just imagine
that what I'm saying to you is true.

31:22.885 --> 31:26.963
That he's here and that he loves you and he feels
really bad about not being in your life.

31:27.395 --> 31:29.410
If you could tell him
one more thing,what would it be?

31:34.686 --> 31:36.861
I'd tell him to go to hell.

31:51.156 --> 31:52.963
I'm so sorry.

31:52.965 --> 31:54.553
Don't be. She's right.

31:54.556 --> 31:56.252
She did the only thing
she could do--

31:56.255 --> 31:59.632
she hardened her heart to me,
she got on with her life.

32:00.107 --> 32:02.722
There's no reason she should forgive me.
No reason at all.

32:15.885 --> 32:20.090
Wow,you should have seen her.
She was so bitter,so hard.

32:20.097 --> 32:22.913
Is that what I'm like when
I talk about my father?

32:25.018 --> 32:28.022
Listen,everybody's gotta put
the hard shell on,you know?

32:28.747 --> 32:30.390
That means yes.

32:30.398 --> 32:32.730
No,that means no.

32:35.168 --> 32:38.140
You know,I can
feel the hurt.

32:39.718 --> 32:42.322
Look,the good news is,
you overcame the hurt.

32:42.327 --> 32:46.681
Helped somebody else
and maybe,in the process,

32:46.685 --> 32:48.722
you helped yourself.

32:48.955 --> 32:51.060
You always know
the right thing to say.

32:52.695 --> 32:54.682
I used to always know
the right thing to say.

32:54.686 --> 32:57.643
Yesterday you wanted
to bite my head off.

32:57.648 --> 33:00.933
Oh...you were saying the right thing yesterday,
I just didn't know it.

33:03.706 --> 33:05.423
I can't sleep.

33:29.715 --> 33:32.160
I'm steve burris.

33:36.758 --> 33:39.983
Are you gonna make trouble for me?
I need to know.

33:39.988 --> 33:41.752
You heard me
talking to kate.

33:41.757 --> 33:44.882
I was on my way back
from the mailbox when she drove up.

33:45.255 --> 33:48.682
I stayed by the side of the house waiting
for her to leave,and then you came.

33:48.686 --> 33:51.030
That stuff you told her,
how'd you know all that?

33:51.036 --> 33:53.503
Adam told me.

33:53.926 --> 33:58.540
Right. I heard that whole bit
about how you talk to the dead.

34:00.728 --> 34:02.940
Come on,tell me the truth.
How'd you really know?

34:02.945 --> 34:06.431
I wasn't lying.Adam told me about the night
that he ran out of gas.

34:06.436 --> 34:08.440
How you picked up,
you told him about your money troubles,

34:08.445 --> 34:11.583
and you told him that you would be worth
more dead than alive.

34:12.177 --> 34:13.360
No one knew that.

34:13.368 --> 34:15.083
He said he was
killed in the storm,

34:15.085 --> 34:18.652
and that you stole his wallet so that you
could fake your death. Now he's in your grave.

34:20.616 --> 34:22.842
I'm sorry.

34:24.547 --> 34:27.130
I didn't know
what else to do.

34:27.755 --> 34:30.630
I was on the verge
of suicide,and...

34:31.906 --> 34:35.943
when this happened,
it seemed the only answer.

34:35.947 --> 34:37.563
You found him.

34:37.568 --> 34:39.982
He found me.

34:39.985 --> 34:42.110
Adam's here now.

34:43.966 --> 34:46.730
Please...

34:46.735 --> 34:50.590
if he's really here,
make him understand I was desperate.

34:50.596 --> 34:53.830
Tell him I know,I've been there,
but this isn't the way to go.

34:53.835 --> 34:56.791
He says he understands,
but this isn't the answer.

34:56.797 --> 34:59.841
You can't just leave him
in the wrong grave.

34:59.847 --> 35:03.063
He has to hear
shelby crying everyday.

35:03.068 --> 35:05.660
Shelby cries?

35:06.177 --> 35:07.403
For me?

35:07.405 --> 35:11.232
Tell him he's lucky.
I threw away the people who love me.

35:11.235 --> 35:14.421
Adam only wishes
he could have had what you have.

35:14.427 --> 35:17.371
But he told me . he needed to be free.
I understood that.

35:17.378 --> 35:19.063
That's what
I wanted,too!

35:19.068 --> 35:21.170
No,it's not freedom,
I was wrong.

35:21.177 --> 35:23.692
He was wrong. He doesn't
feel free. He feels...

35:26.737 --> 35:29.652
very,very,sad.

35:31.786 --> 35:34.152
And he wants you tell shelby
that you're alive.

35:34.156 --> 35:36.940
I can'T. She'll--
she'll never forgive me.

35:36.946 --> 35:41.000
You gotta risk it.
Look at all the other risks you took.

35:41.416 --> 35:43.922
He says you have to risk it.

35:43.927 --> 35:46.230
And tell him I forgive him
for the rest.

35:46.238 --> 35:50.192
And he forgives you
for the rest of it.

35:50.196 --> 35:52.602
He does?

35:52.607 --> 35:54.913
He does.

35:56.185 --> 35:59.071
Steve...
she will,too.

36:06.705 --> 36:09.470
You should feel good about
what you said to him.

36:09.476 --> 36:12.461
Even if nothing comes of it,
you're a good man.

36:12.467 --> 36:16.970
That's nice of you to say,
even if we both know it isn't true.

36:18.215 --> 36:20.921
Melinda?
Hi,I got your message.

36:22.337 --> 36:24.961
Um...yes,there's
something that I have to tell you.

36:24.967 --> 36:26.613
Ok,the night that steve died,

36:26.617 --> 36:30.970
you said that he was alone,
and that's not really true.It isn't?

36:31.398 --> 36:32.373
How do you know?

36:32.375 --> 36:35.903
My friend,the one that I was
telling you about,adam godfrey,

36:36.527 --> 36:37.850
he was with him
that night.

36:37.856 --> 36:40.082
He was?
But you said he's dead.

36:40.088 --> 36:42.612
He is.
He died that night.

36:42.618 --> 36:44.091
But they only found
one body.

36:44.096 --> 36:46.862
I know.
And it wasn't steve'S.

36:46.865 --> 36:49.303
It was adam'S.

36:50.877 --> 36:53.271
Melinda,what are you
trying to tell me?

36:54.808 --> 36:58.163
What I'm trying
to tell you is...

37:02.018 --> 37:04.942
what I'm trying to tell you is
to look over there.

37:08.855 --> 37:11.591
Oh,my god!

37:12.845 --> 37:16.221
Oh,my god! Steve!

37:16.727 --> 37:17.970
You're alive!

37:17.975 --> 37:20.850
Oh,shelby,
I missed you so much.

37:22.068 --> 37:24.463
How is this possible?
What happened?

37:24.465 --> 37:28.261
Oh,my god,I'm seeing your face again!
I love you so much!

37:28.267 --> 37:30.461
Shelby,I have a lot to tell you.
I've done something

37:30.468 --> 37:32.382
you're not gonna like,
it's something bad.

37:32.386 --> 37:33.680
There's gonna be lawsuits
and trouble--

37:33.685 --> 37:35.441
I don't care,
I don't care!

37:35.445 --> 37:38.140
As long
as you're alive!

37:41.987 --> 37:42.971
Thank you.

37:54.395 --> 37:58.900
In my version,he'd probably drop dead of a
heart attack as soon as they left the cemetery.

37:58.907 --> 38:01.571
I don't think so,
I read your book.

38:01.577 --> 38:02.631
You did?

38:02.636 --> 38:05.372
I did. Last night,
it was beautiful.

38:05.378 --> 38:09.653
And I can understand
why the writer would need to live alone.

38:09.655 --> 38:12.682
I'm not sure
I understand.

38:15.808 --> 38:18.353
You need to forgive yourself
a little.

38:18.358 --> 38:21.910
She'll never come,
will she? My daughter.

38:21.918 --> 38:24.251
She'll never visit
her father's grave.

38:24.256 --> 38:26.502
- You never know.
- Yes,I do.

38:27.318 --> 38:30.143
This is one story
that won't have a happy ending.

38:31.818 --> 38:34.551
Look,adam,
I'm not your daughter...

38:35.157 --> 38:38.622
but I guess you've noticed
that I have some issues of my own.

38:40.205 --> 38:42.812
But you know what?
If I wasas your daughter,I would...

38:43.846 --> 38:46.883
I would find it in my heart
to forgive you.

38:46.888 --> 38:48.902
Why?

38:48.907 --> 38:52.063
Maybe it's because
I read your book.

38:52.068 --> 38:55.873
Or maybe it's because
I realize that everybody has their own story.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.293
And you just don't know it.

38:58.296 --> 39:00.973
So how's your story
going to end?

39:00.976 --> 39:03.423
Happy.

39:03.918 --> 39:07.412
It's all you can ask for,
right,is a happy ending.

39:09.357 --> 39:11.303
No...

39:11.306 --> 39:13.153
don't tell me it--

39:13.156 --> 39:15.082
really exists.

39:15.087 --> 39:16.640
It does.

39:16.645 --> 39:17.880
Well,I'll be damned.

39:17.888 --> 39:20.062
Actually,
that's not the idea.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.880
But...why do i
get to see it?

39:22.885 --> 39:26.290
I mean,I pretty much
failed on every level of my life.

39:26.297 --> 39:28.910
Because you found
some peace.

39:29.337 --> 39:31.790
At least a little bit.
Am I wrong?

39:31.797 --> 39:35.040
No. You're not wrong.

39:35.627 --> 39:37.390
Thank you.

39:38.197 --> 39:40.312
You're very welcome.

40:47.168 --> 40:48.163
Damn!

40:48.165 --> 40:49.321
What happened?

40:49.328 --> 40:52.911
I tripped over this bag again
and I twisted my ankle.

40:52.916 --> 40:55.873
Stuff like that has been happening to me
for the past 3 days.

40:55.877 --> 40:58.512
Well,maybe it's the curse
of that pirate outfit you're wearing.

40:58.518 --> 41:01.353
Look,I am going to a great halloween party.
Do you want to come?

41:01.356 --> 41:03.901
Ugh,no. I'm gonna go home,
take a hot bath,

41:03.907 --> 41:05.953
and think about anything
but ghosts.

41:05.956 --> 41:09.411
You know,I don't get you.
Ghosts and spooks are fun.

41:09.417 --> 41:11.183
Yeah.

41:12.138 --> 41:14.180
Will you do me a favor?

41:14.188 --> 41:18.542
Sell this bag.
Ever since I got it,I have
had the worst luck.

41:18.547 --> 41:20.751
I thought you didn't
believe in anything like that.

41:20.755 --> 41:23.041
Yeah,well,I don'T.
Just shows you how desperate I am.

41:24.676 --> 41:26.243
I will be happy
to sell it for you.

41:26.248 --> 41:30.610
Hey,delia,tomorrow why don't we close up
and go to lunch together?

41:31.245 --> 41:33.050
- Sounds good.
- Happy halloween.

41:38.468 --> 41:42.300
About time.I thought I'd never
get rid of that girl.Now,look inside.

41:43.777 --> 41:46.111
- I don't see a note.
- Check the lining.

41:47.297 --> 41:48.072
Nothing.

41:48.076 --> 41:51.160
There's a little rip in the lining.
You have to feel around.

41:51.167 --> 41:53.022
All right!

41:55.707 --> 41:57.293
I found it!

42:00.576 --> 42:03.411
Oh,I'm so sorry,marilyn.

42:03.417 --> 42:05.780
I don't you're gonna like
what this has to say.

42:05.788 --> 42:09.020
What? What does it say?

42:09.628 --> 42:12.631
"Rip my heart out,
why don't you."

42:15.596 --> 42:19.630
He still loved me.
Luca still loved me!

42:19.638 --> 42:23.433
It's what we said to each other after every
break-up when we got back together.

42:23.435 --> 42:26.910
"Rip my heart out,
why don't you."

42:26.918 --> 42:29.592
It meant everything was going
to be ok now.

42:31.538 --> 42:32.882
Oh...I get it.

42:32.886 --> 42:35.722
Oh,I really have
to find him now.

42:35.725 --> 42:39.192
Oh,let me stop you
right there--you don't want to do that.

42:40.118 --> 42:41.911
Do you see a light?

42:42.238 --> 42:44.620
Yes.

42:45.388 --> 42:49.450
Yeah,well then,
you should go into it and wait for him.

42:49.827 --> 42:51.981
That could take
a long time.

42:51.987 --> 42:54.661
It won't seem that long.
Trust me.

42:55.056 --> 42:58.270
Go.
Wait for him to rip your heart out.

43:51.326 --> 43:54.673
Sorry! I ran out of candy
a couple of hours ago.

43:55.555 --> 43:57.783
Bye.

44:04.107 --> 44:08.781
5 signs death
will come...
