01:29.638 --> 01:30.640
Help me, please!

01:32.141 --> 01:34.743
Please help me! Come on!

01:36.745 --> 01:37.780
Help me, please!

03:33.996 --> 03:35.397
- Yes?
- Hey, Amy, um,

03:36.899 --> 03:38.367
I didn't think I'd get a chance to talk
to you before you went to college.

03:39.467 --> 03:41.670
Well, you got me. What's up?

03:42.138 --> 03:43.303
<i>Look, when I came down,</i>

03:43.305 --> 03:44.606
<i>all the lights
were left on again.</i>

03:44.806 --> 03:45.841
Fuck.

03:46.542 --> 03:47.774
I know you don't like the dark

03:47.776 --> 03:49.578
but it's gonna kill
the electricity bill.

03:50.612 --> 03:52.414
I know. I'm sorry, I just...

03:52.814 --> 03:54.751
I really don't like the dark.

03:55.918 --> 03:58.855
Look, I'm really... I'm not trying
to give you a hard time or anything,

03:59.087 --> 04:01.454
<i>but, like, can you not
just stand outside the room</i>

04:01.456 --> 04:04.060
<i>and just reach in
and switch off the light?</i>

04:04.560 --> 04:05.895
Yeah, I'll try it.

04:06.829 --> 04:09.265
Look, I'm sorry, I've just...
I've always been that way.

04:09.664 --> 04:11.565
But I'm... I'm starting
that new job tonight,

04:11.567 --> 04:13.233
so I'll pick up
anything extra on the bill,

04:13.235 --> 04:14.604
I'll have some extra cash.

04:15.070 --> 04:16.706
Great. Thanks, Amy.

04:17.206 --> 04:18.438
Have a good day in college.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.774
Thanks, you too.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.911
- <i>See you.</i>
- Bye

05:37.286 --> 05:38.221
Professor?

05:39.588 --> 05:41.558
Oh, it's Abby,
the American student, yeah?

05:42.257 --> 05:45.228
Half Irish, half American.
And it... it's Amy.

05:45.427 --> 05:46.692
Of course, I'm James.

05:46.694 --> 05:48.831
We don't really do
the professor thing here.

05:49.464 --> 05:50.596
What can I do for you?

05:50.598 --> 05:52.699
Uh, you said something
in class today

05:52.701 --> 05:55.168
about picking
an artist or a creator to study

05:55.170 --> 05:57.139
and I wanted to pick somebody
from Limerick.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.309
That's a good approach.

06:00.074 --> 06:03.012
Well, there's been a lot of good,
creative people in Limerick.

06:03.211 --> 06:05.048
Uh, Frank McCourt, the writer...

06:05.781 --> 06:07.783
Richard Harris, Hollywood actor.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.250
But everybody knows
about these people already.

06:10.252 --> 06:12.355
If you really want to get a feel
for the city,

06:12.754 --> 06:15.557
go in and talk to the people,
listen to their stories.

06:15.858 --> 06:18.724
You might even discover
Limerick's next great creator.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.060
That's a good idea.

06:20.062 --> 06:22.596
Do you have any recommendations
where I could start?

06:22.598 --> 06:24.031
Now, if I told you that

06:24.033 --> 06:26.302
I'd end up grading my own work,
wouldn't I?

06:26.668 --> 06:28.570
But it's a city
with a great history.

06:28.836 --> 06:31.671
Battles have been waged here,
great art has been made,

06:31.673 --> 06:34.276
but some fairly horrible things
have happened, too.

06:34.576 --> 06:36.709
Just...
don't go down the easy route

06:36.711 --> 06:38.579
and end up writing
about some pretty sculpture

06:38.581 --> 06:39.712
you found in a gallery.

06:39.714 --> 06:41.113
Give me something different,
okay?

06:41.115 --> 06:43.185
Okay. Thanks... James.

06:44.353 --> 06:47.122
Oh, um, I will probably be...

06:47.456 --> 06:49.255
a bit late to class
in the morning.

06:49.257 --> 06:51.793
What is it about students
and early starts?

06:52.661 --> 06:54.596
Wednesday's hardly
a session night, is it?

06:55.029 --> 06:57.566
No. No, I'm not going out.
I, um...

06:57.865 --> 07:00.000
I got a new job
and its night shifts.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.969
- Oh, so you're on the other side of the bar?
- Not quite.

07:02.971 --> 07:06.775
I'm still dealing with people
but it's the Limerick Hotel.

07:07.041 --> 07:08.110
Oh, wow...

07:10.045 --> 07:12.445
If you really want to get to know...

07:12.447 --> 07:13.849
Sorry just a sec...

07:14.649 --> 07:16.852
- Don't be too late.
- Okay, thank you.

07:18.420 --> 07:19.588
Yeah.

08:30.759 --> 08:32.792
- <i>Hey, honey.</i>
- Hey, Mom.

08:32.794 --> 08:34.529
<i>Oh, we miss you
so much.</i>

08:35.063 --> 08:36.631
I've only been gone a month.

08:36.999 --> 08:40.102
<i>Ha, a month away
from your parents in Ireland.</i>

08:40.436 --> 08:42.304
- <i>We miss you.</i>
- I know.

08:42.837 --> 08:45.839
- I guess I miss you both too.
- <i>Very funny, missy.</i>

08:45.841 --> 08:47.741
<i>So how are you finding
your cousins? Are they nice?</i>

08:47.743 --> 08:49.646
Yeah. Yeah, they're nice,
I like them.

08:50.278 --> 08:52.981
It's taken me a while
to figure everything out.

08:53.381 --> 08:56.084
They've got slang words
for everything over here.

08:56.351 --> 08:57.416
But no, I like them.

08:57.418 --> 08:58.685
<i>Now you know how I feel.</i>

08:58.687 --> 08:59.986
<i>Thirty years with your father</i>

08:59.988 --> 09:02.358
<i>and I'm just now understanding
that accent.</i>

09:02.725 --> 09:04.394
<i>So have you started
your new job yet?</i>

09:04.592 --> 09:07.462
Uh, no. I start tonight at ten.

09:08.364 --> 09:10.233
General duty night staff.

09:10.698 --> 09:12.132
<i>Oh, that's very late.</i>

09:12.134 --> 09:16.004
No, no.
Um, I finish at six and then...

09:16.437 --> 09:18.941
I'm not in college till one,
so it's fine.

09:19.274 --> 09:21.241
- <i>Okay, good.</i>
- I'm tough, like you.

09:21.243 --> 09:23.743
<i>I'm so proud of you, honey.
We all are.</i>

09:23.745 --> 09:25.048
<i>Thanks, mom.</i>

09:25.581 --> 09:26.783
<i>I love you.</i>

10:44.426 --> 10:45.360
New girl...

10:47.428 --> 10:48.430
Hey...

10:49.530 --> 10:51.466
Hey... new girl.

10:51.899 --> 10:55.538
- Yes. Hey, sorry. Hi, I'm Amy.
- Adam.

10:56.538 --> 10:57.974
Let me show you the ropes.

10:58.807 --> 11:01.074
- Right, this is your guest phone.
- Mm-hmm.

11:01.076 --> 11:02.541
This is the outside phone.

11:02.543 --> 11:04.578
We more than likely won't be
using the outside phone,

11:04.580 --> 11:07.817
unless some crazy old one wants to book
a room in the middle of the night.

11:08.149 --> 11:10.449
All we have to do is answer
these two phones,

11:10.451 --> 11:12.955
bring stuff up to guests
if they want it and just...

11:13.554 --> 11:15.424
- tidy up.
- Okay, sure.

11:16.491 --> 11:18.824
There's not many here tonight
so it should be easy enough.

11:18.826 --> 11:21.096
- Great!
- So...

11:21.797 --> 11:24.332
- You're an American girl?
- Yes, I am.

11:25.167 --> 11:27.166
I couldn't tell whether you were
a Yank or a Canuck.

11:27.168 --> 11:29.869
I can never tell the difference
between the... the accents.

11:29.871 --> 11:31.072
Right.

11:33.174 --> 11:34.907
I'm sorry,
that's like when people say,

11:34.909 --> 11:36.545
"Is Ireland still part of UK?"

11:37.778 --> 11:38.814
Isn't it?

11:39.981 --> 11:42.549
Well, it... it depends on...
on who... who we're talking to,

11:42.551 --> 11:44.187
I suppose...

11:45.854 --> 11:46.953
Very clever.

11:46.955 --> 11:48.153
So what are you doing in Ireland

11:48.155 --> 11:50.158
other than contesting
our independence?

11:50.558 --> 11:54.297
- Um, I'm studying for an arts degree.
- Hmm.

12:00.001 --> 12:02.037
Have you worked here long?

12:03.105 --> 12:04.105
Oh...

12:05.774 --> 12:08.543
Too long.
Ever since they reopened.

12:09.344 --> 12:11.514
Oh, you're up.

12:16.884 --> 12:18.354
Hello, reception.

12:21.023 --> 12:22.488
Yes. Yep, that's no problem.

12:22.490 --> 12:24.427
I'll get those up to you
in a couple of minutes.

12:25.027 --> 12:26.429
Okay, thank you.

12:29.030 --> 12:32.732
There you go, the call with the nuclear
launch codes. What do they want?

12:32.734 --> 12:36.105
Um, room 537 wants
some extra towels.

12:37.940 --> 12:39.175
Bet ya he's an old lad.

12:39.774 --> 12:42.278
Let me see, 5-3-7...

12:43.845 --> 12:46.682
Yep... an old lad. I knew it.

12:47.149 --> 12:49.248
They always want new towels
for some reason.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.086
I... I don't want to ask.

12:51.285 --> 12:53.154
Well, what are you waiting for?

12:54.423 --> 12:58.458
- Uh, towels are?
- Oh that's right, uh, okay.

12:58.460 --> 12:59.892
This is your swipe card.

12:59.894 --> 13:01.994
This will open up all the doors,
it's right through there.

13:01.996 --> 13:03.498
- Okay.
- Take this with you.

13:03.899 --> 13:05.934
I'll call you if you get stuck.

13:07.336 --> 13:08.504
Right, okay.

13:15.711 --> 13:16.812
Jesus.

13:17.511 --> 13:19.447
Why do I have to be
the one to get them?

13:20.682 --> 13:23.719
<i>You gotta speak into the walkie.</i>

13:24.385 --> 13:26.621
<i>I can see you on camera now,
I got you.</i>

13:32.494 --> 13:36.331
<i>Why are you acting so nervous?
Is it the hotel?</i>

13:37.698 --> 13:40.635
No, I just don't really like
being down here on my own.

13:41.970 --> 13:43.268
Wait, what do you mean,
the hotel?

13:43.270 --> 13:45.905
<i>It's history, the... the murders.</i>

13:45.907 --> 13:48.711
- Very funny.
- <i>No, they're real.</i>

13:49.110 --> 13:51.111
- <i>It was a while ago but...</i>
- Adam, stop.

13:51.113 --> 13:53.546
<i>Oh, come on.
It happened a long time ago.</i>

13:53.548 --> 13:55.283
<i>It had to be close...</i>

14:01.623 --> 14:04.060
Boo!

14:04.993 --> 14:06.195
For next time.

14:10.032 --> 14:11.367
Are we good?

14:23.879 --> 14:25.648
One goes up, one goes down.

14:27.115 --> 14:29.118
It's, uh, slow and annoying.

14:31.687 --> 14:34.320
This is where you say
something clever like, er,

14:34.322 --> 14:36.458
"So are you," you know...

14:37.158 --> 14:38.561
slow and annoying.

14:39.126 --> 14:40.462
That's not clever.

15:26.041 --> 15:27.743
Hello?

15:28.275 --> 15:30.745
This is Amy from reception,
I have your towels.

15:32.748 --> 15:33.749
Sir?

15:40.121 --> 15:41.890
- Hey, Adam?
- <i>Yep.</i>

15:42.190 --> 15:43.759
This guy's not answering.

15:45.126 --> 15:46.861
<i>Just leave them
outside the door for him.</i>

15:48.330 --> 15:50.129
Yeah, but... he's mumbling

15:50.131 --> 15:52.233
and he's not talking
when I call him.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.204
- <i>And?</i>
- What if he's not okay?

15:55.537 --> 15:56.839
<i>I'm... I'm sure he's fine,</i>

15:57.105 --> 16:00.009
<i>what if he's... watching TV
or just on the phone, or...</i>

16:00.708 --> 16:02.407
<i>doing something nasty
in the bathroom?</i>

16:02.409 --> 16:05.177
<i>Remember,
don't ask about the towels.</i>

16:05.179 --> 16:07.946
<i>Just leave them there. He'll get
up and get them when he's ready.</i>

16:07.948 --> 16:09.250
Fine.

16:32.841 --> 16:34.610
Oh, good. Um...

16:34.942 --> 16:36.778
Here are your towels.

17:20.521 --> 17:21.756
Fuck it!

17:27.394 --> 17:28.798
Your turn in a minute.

17:30.030 --> 17:31.500
Where are you getting
all these nuts?

17:31.766 --> 17:33.235
The minibar supply room.

17:35.202 --> 17:36.538
You just take them?

17:38.573 --> 17:42.278
Who do you think actually eats
these from the mini bar? Huh?

17:43.077 --> 17:44.046
Nobody.

17:45.247 --> 17:46.615
I mean, who's gonna spend
a fiver on a shitty bag of nuts?

17:48.750 --> 17:49.884
So you just take them?

17:50.785 --> 17:51.687
Well...

17:52.788 --> 17:55.557
They keep buying them...
I'm going to keep eating them.

17:56.557 --> 17:57.559
Oh!

18:02.297 --> 18:03.798
Well, shit.

18:06.134 --> 18:08.136
- Hey, sir.
- Hello, sir, how can I help you?

18:08.569 --> 18:10.438
Yeah, I'd like a room
for tonight, please.

18:11.071 --> 18:12.373
Of course.

18:13.642 --> 18:15.811
If you could just fill this
out here.

18:17.846 --> 18:20.649
Can you excuse me
just for one moment?

18:22.951 --> 18:26.652
Okay. So... go in the back,
get some peanuts and stuff

18:26.654 --> 18:28.187
from the mini bar supplies,
okay?

18:28.189 --> 18:29.191
What?

18:29.423 --> 18:30.690
If we make a fuss out of him,

18:30.692 --> 18:32.225
he's not going to tell
the day staff tomorrow

18:32.227 --> 18:33.394
about the mess.

18:33.694 --> 18:34.663
Fine.

18:42.903 --> 18:43.905
Thank you.

19:00.154 --> 19:04.123
And... this is your key card.

19:04.125 --> 19:05.391
And the room number's
right there,

19:05.393 --> 19:08.197
we've upgraded you to the suite,
free of charge.

19:08.596 --> 19:14.103
And, um, here are some... gifts,
to say sorry about the delay.

19:14.402 --> 19:15.971
Complementary, of course.

19:16.904 --> 19:17.906
No, thanks.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.889
The, um, the stairs
are over here.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.936
Slow and annoying right?

19:51.239 --> 19:54.343
Slow and annoying... Yeah.

20:04.251 --> 20:05.220
Did you, uh...

20:05.686 --> 20:07.822
notice anything strange
about that guy?

20:08.890 --> 20:09.892
Not really.

20:10.357 --> 20:12.924
I guess
he's checking into a hotel

20:12.926 --> 20:15.094
in the middle of the night
with no reservation.

20:15.096 --> 20:16.332
No, that's not it.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.401
He didn't have any luggage.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.646
Jesus, put a lid on that, quick.

20:34.782 --> 20:37.618
Will you bring that downstairs?
Hello, reception.

20:39.386 --> 20:41.022
Yes, I... I think we might.

20:41.722 --> 20:43.389
Uh, I'll just check
in the lost and found.

20:43.391 --> 20:44.893
I'll bring one up to you.
Is that okay?

20:45.660 --> 20:47.963
Okay, sir, thank you. Bye.

20:48.829 --> 20:50.196
It was your man from earlier.

20:50.198 --> 20:51.533
He's looking for
a phone charger.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.432
I'll have to check
in the lost and found.

20:53.434 --> 20:55.034
Will you bring that down
to the big bins please?

20:55.036 --> 20:57.405
- That's fucking disgusting.
- Yeah, I know.

20:57.905 --> 20:58.941
Where am I going?

20:59.140 --> 21:00.672
Same as the service room,
just turn right.

21:00.674 --> 21:03.044
- Is it dark too?
- No, no. There's lights.

22:47.248 --> 22:49.884
Whoa, whoa, Jesus!
What happened?

22:50.184 --> 22:52.852
There's somebody out there.
He chased me, he attacked me!

22:52.854 --> 22:55.188
What? Are you okay?
Did he do this to you?

22:55.190 --> 22:56.455
No, I tripped into it.

22:56.457 --> 22:57.890
Oh. He didn't touch you
or anything?

22:57.892 --> 23:00.796
- No. No, he chased me.
- What does he look like?

23:01.628 --> 23:03.731
He... he was pale, he...

23:03.932 --> 23:05.931
he had a scraggly beard thing.

23:05.933 --> 23:07.667
- He's filthy.
- Yeah, he's filthy.

23:07.669 --> 23:09.834
Yeah, it's that
fucking homeless guy again.

23:09.836 --> 23:11.536
No. No, this guy was scary,

23:11.538 --> 23:13.206
like there was something
really wrong with him.

23:13.208 --> 23:15.641
Amy, I'm telling you. This isn't
the first time he's done this.

23:15.643 --> 23:19.615
He goes through the bins looking for stuff
that the... the guests leave behind.

23:22.250 --> 23:23.317
I'll look after this, okay?

23:23.550 --> 23:24.717
Why don't you just go up
to one of the empty rooms,

23:24.719 --> 23:26.855
clean yourself up, okay?
Here, look...

23:30.357 --> 23:31.894
Uh, room 509 is empty.

23:32.227 --> 23:34.826
Just go up there,
clean yourself off, relax.

23:34.828 --> 23:37.028
I'll have a cup of tea for you
when you come down, okay?

23:37.030 --> 23:38.797
Are you sure? Are you gonna be
okay on your own?

23:38.799 --> 23:41.702
Yes, trust me. We're practically
arch enemies at this point.

23:42.470 --> 23:43.771
Here we go.

24:29.683 --> 24:31.853
All right, Fuck-o.

24:44.298 --> 24:46.667
Ah, Jesus Christ!

24:54.142 --> 24:55.876
Dirty bastard.

27:16.517 --> 27:17.919
Three more hours.

28:24.585 --> 28:25.487
Adam?

28:34.761 --> 28:35.963
Adam?

28:39.534 --> 28:42.070
If that's not you,
you better get up here quick.

28:57.384 --> 28:58.487
Hello?

28:59.854 --> 29:01.053
Hello,
if you're not a guest here,

29:01.055 --> 29:02.923
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

29:18.071 --> 29:19.740
Jesus Christ!

29:20.775 --> 29:23.812
I'm sorry I thought that that...
I thought that guy got in.

29:24.010 --> 29:25.411
You gotta stop this shit.

29:25.413 --> 29:27.582
I told you I'd get rid of him,
he never comes in here.

29:27.781 --> 29:29.350
Okay, Jesus.

29:30.451 --> 29:31.586
Sorry, I...

29:33.186 --> 29:34.688
Where were you coming from?

29:36.457 --> 29:37.425
Really?

29:38.491 --> 29:40.161
I was looking for
the wet floor sign, you happy?

29:40.861 --> 29:42.760
I think there's one
in the service room.

29:42.762 --> 29:45.332
Right. Well, I'll go get it
to save all the drama.

29:45.932 --> 29:48.936
Let's just take a break and
have a cup of tea, sound good?

29:49.903 --> 29:51.105
All right.

30:08.823 --> 30:11.055
- So did you find him?
- No.

30:11.057 --> 30:13.161
But the gate is open
so he must've left.

30:14.428 --> 30:17.332
Look, he's been here since
before I started working here,

30:17.897 --> 30:18.933
he's harmless.

30:19.432 --> 30:21.667
He just gets stuff
out of the bin from the kitchen,

30:21.669 --> 30:22.737
you know, junk and stuff.

30:23.637 --> 30:26.374
- He wouldn't hurt you,
- He chased me, Adam.

30:27.008 --> 30:28.209
Yeah, well...

30:29.477 --> 30:30.579
I don't know.

30:33.748 --> 30:37.815
Right. You have not experienced Ireland
until you've had a cup of tea,

30:37.817 --> 30:39.086
and some of these.

30:40.855 --> 30:42.591
I know you've had
a shitty first day,

30:42.890 --> 30:44.326
but it's not always like this.

30:45.125 --> 30:47.095
We've a pretty easy job,
you know.

30:48.729 --> 30:50.065
I looked it up.

30:50.897 --> 30:52.634
- What?
- The murders.

30:53.667 --> 30:55.633
What'd you do that for? You
don't need to know that shit...

30:55.635 --> 30:57.236
I thought you were just trying
to give me a hard time.

30:57.238 --> 30:59.774
- I didn't think it actually happened.
- Now you know.

31:01.509 --> 31:02.544
I just...

31:03.744 --> 31:05.412
I don't understand how they
could open this place again.

31:08.449 --> 31:09.451
People forget...

31:10.417 --> 31:12.086
Tourists don't know
their history.

31:12.318 --> 31:14.489
It's pretty easy
when there's money involved.

31:15.221 --> 31:18.259
It's horrible.
I mean that elevator...

31:18.992 --> 31:20.260
I know.

31:24.765 --> 31:25.767
You know...

31:26.701 --> 31:28.870
that was the only thing
they didn't replace,

31:29.303 --> 31:30.438
during the refitting.

31:31.872 --> 31:33.441
It's too expensive, you know?

31:34.541 --> 31:36.410
I mean they cleaned it,
and they...

31:36.911 --> 31:38.779
put new tiles and stuff,
but they, uh...

31:40.181 --> 31:42.146
- they didn't put a new one in.
- So there's still stuff

31:42.148 --> 31:44.717
- from the murders in the hotel?
- Oh, no. No.

31:44.719 --> 31:46.485
Anything with blood on it
was taken away,

31:46.487 --> 31:48.223
which was
pretty much everything. They...

31:48.422 --> 31:51.826
they re-did the carpets,
re-wallpapered the walls.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.730
They even had a priest
come in and bless the place.

31:56.564 --> 31:58.967
- Why did they do that?
- It's Ireland.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.799
You have to go to confession
if you take a shite.

32:04.904 --> 32:06.607
Yeah, but why blessed though?

32:09.743 --> 32:11.311
Do you really want to know?

32:12.546 --> 32:13.480
Mm-hmm.

32:15.015 --> 32:17.719
Okay. Well...

32:19.586 --> 32:21.219
When they were
taking the bodies out,

32:21.221 --> 32:22.456
they noticed all these...

32:22.957 --> 32:24.392
markings on the skin.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.258
He'd cut the insides
out of his victims

32:27.260 --> 32:29.798
and covered himself
in some sort of... ritual.

32:30.530 --> 32:34.034
Of course, the church went mad,
tried to cover it up, but...

32:34.835 --> 32:37.236
someone's uncle's cousin
knew one of the priests

32:37.238 --> 32:39.274
involved in the blessing
and then...

32:40.007 --> 32:41.209
Now you know.

32:43.243 --> 32:44.611
What about the guy?

32:45.412 --> 32:48.615
- It said they never found him.
- Oh, nobody knows where he is.

32:49.450 --> 32:51.251
Everyone has their theory,
you know?

32:51.885 --> 32:54.553
Some of the more outlandish ones
involve aliens coming down

32:54.555 --> 32:56.524
and opening some portal to hell.

32:57.023 --> 32:58.422
Another one
is that he was hiding here

32:58.424 --> 33:00.194
and then died in the walls.

33:00.560 --> 33:01.562
Great.

33:02.262 --> 33:04.732
I know.
They're all bullshit.

33:07.067 --> 33:10.637
What I think happened is that he
killed the last one in the elevator...

33:11.204 --> 33:12.406
then nothing.

33:13.973 --> 33:16.507
The gates of hell didn't open
and welcome him in,

33:16.509 --> 33:19.446
he didn't ascend
into some higher power, <i>nada.</i>

33:20.013 --> 33:23.081
He just panicked, you know,
he cleaned the stuff off himself

33:23.083 --> 33:24.352
and walked out the door.

33:25.118 --> 33:26.418
And now he's living somewhere,

33:26.420 --> 33:29.157
working some shitty job,
waiting to ascend.

33:33.626 --> 33:34.628
It just...

33:35.229 --> 33:37.664
doesn't feel right being here.

33:38.298 --> 33:40.532
Something feels off
about the place.

33:40.534 --> 33:41.569
Amy...

33:42.303 --> 33:43.905
You're working the night shift.

33:44.404 --> 33:45.973
I mean this happens,
you're tired.

33:46.307 --> 33:48.175
It affects people
in different ways.

33:48.942 --> 33:50.744
I mean,
it is a pretty big hotel.

33:51.345 --> 33:54.348
Lightbulbs go, doors creak,
you just...

33:55.082 --> 33:56.518
have to get over it.

33:57.817 --> 33:59.253
Are you serious?

34:00.554 --> 34:02.390
I've had the night from hell,
I've been...

34:02.856 --> 34:04.291
chased and scared and...

34:04.858 --> 34:07.996
covered in shit that was no doubt
left there from your last shift.

34:08.393 --> 34:10.527
Not to mention you have me doing
all the legwork,

34:10.530 --> 34:13.601
while you sit on your ass
and play with peanuts.

34:14.367 --> 34:16.837
And after all this shit,
I'm still here.

34:17.737 --> 34:19.840
Yeah, I think
that's getting over it.

34:20.340 --> 34:21.442
No, I'm getting on with it.

34:21.708 --> 34:24.275
Right. Okay, okay, okay.
I know it's not very fair of me.

34:24.277 --> 34:25.612
- No its not.
- Well, look...

34:25.913 --> 34:29.112
I'll stop giving you a hard time
and I'll pick up the slack.

34:29.114 --> 34:32.083
I... I was just trying to get you
up to speed with the place.

34:32.085 --> 34:33.620
I think I'm up to speed.

34:39.726 --> 34:40.893
In all fairness...

34:41.795 --> 34:44.398
I'd be fairly spooked
if it was my first day.

34:44.632 --> 34:45.967
It's fine.

34:47.101 --> 34:48.303
We're good.

34:51.838 --> 34:52.840
Great.

34:56.976 --> 34:59.413
So what's the etiquette, then?

35:00.581 --> 35:04.152
Is it a dunk?
Or do you sip and bite, or?

35:04.418 --> 35:06.653
Well that's not the question
you need to ask yourself.

35:07.054 --> 35:09.554
What you need to decide
is whether you're a bag in,

35:09.556 --> 35:11.255
or a bag out, kind of girl.

35:18.532 --> 35:20.699
Okay, so, how about this.

35:20.701 --> 35:23.034
I'll sweep the floor,
I'll scrub it,

35:23.036 --> 35:26.740
and I'll be on tea duty for the next
two and a half hours, how about that?

35:27.440 --> 35:28.809
Finally making sense.

36:51.125 --> 36:52.858
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Mom.

36:52.860 --> 36:55.329
<i>Oh, Amy, sweetheart,
are you all right?</i>

36:55.528 --> 36:57.030
Ugh, I don't know.

36:57.864 --> 36:58.765
Just...

36:59.199 --> 37:01.735
having a really tough day here...
Night.

37:02.536 --> 37:04.436
<i>Honey, I know it's hard.</i>

37:04.438 --> 37:06.371
<i>It must be the middle
of the night there, right?</i>

37:06.373 --> 37:08.009
Oh, it's not that, I'm just...

37:08.509 --> 37:11.309
Some homeless guy got
into the hotel and he chased me,

37:11.311 --> 37:13.780
and then I fell
and ruined my uniform.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.818
And the guy I'm working with,
he keeps trying to scare me.

37:17.083 --> 37:19.286
I'm just... done.
I just wanna go home.

37:19.719 --> 37:21.253
<i>Listen, honey.</i>

37:21.255 --> 37:23.458
<i>Don't let this guy scare you.
You're better than this</i>

37:23.657 --> 37:25.226
Normally I wouldn't, but...

37:25.659 --> 37:26.925
I looked up what he said

37:26.927 --> 37:28.894
and there was some pretty bad
murders here,

37:28.896 --> 37:30.061
like ten years ago.

37:30.063 --> 37:31.766
- <i>What?</i>
- I know.

37:32.498 --> 37:33.932
They shut the place down

37:33.934 --> 37:35.737
it just reopened
a couple years ago.

37:35.936 --> 37:39.037
<i>Oh. Well I don't blame you
for being scared, then.</i>

37:39.039 --> 37:42.276
I don't know, this place
isn't worth the extra cash.

37:42.909 --> 37:45.776
<i>Look, all you gotta do
is make it through the night,</i>

37:45.778 --> 37:48.615
<i>and ask to be changed
to the day shift in the morning.</i>

37:49.416 --> 37:50.585
I guess.

37:51.385 --> 37:54.485
Thanks, Mom. I love you.

37:54.487 --> 37:56.121
<i>No problem, honey.
I love you too.</i>

37:56.123 --> 37:57.625
<i>Just do me a favor,</i>

37:57.990 --> 38:00.894
<i>call me in the morning...</i>

38:12.873 --> 38:15.076
Just make it through the night.

38:16.476 --> 38:17.778
Stay awake.

38:18.378 --> 38:19.814
Wait until morning.

38:21.949 --> 38:23.117
You got this.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.242
Hello, reception.

38:49.976 --> 38:52.543
Um, no, sir,
we haven't forgotten about you,

38:52.545 --> 38:55.549
um, just one sec.
Charger?

38:55.949 --> 38:57.018
Shit.

38:57.217 --> 38:58.786
Uh, check the box.

39:00.019 --> 39:01.288
Just one sec, sir.

39:01.922 --> 39:05.492
I think, uh...
Yeah, we have one.

39:05.692 --> 39:07.228
I'll bring that straight up
to you.

39:10.963 --> 39:15.670
- Away I go.
- No, it's fine. I'll go.

39:16.702 --> 39:18.605
I'm falling asleep here anyway.

39:19.106 --> 39:21.405
- You keep cleaning.
- Are you sure you'll be okay?

39:21.407 --> 39:22.807
Yes, I'll be fine.

39:22.809 --> 39:24.144
Don't forget your walkie talkie.

39:24.710 --> 39:25.779
You better believe it.

39:26.012 --> 39:27.914
This guy's weird,
I'll be calling you.

39:50.070 --> 39:52.836
Oh, hey. Adam said we were
the only ones working tonight.

39:52.838 --> 39:55.076
I'm Amy. I'm on reception.

40:07.153 --> 40:08.155
Miss?

40:13.059 --> 40:14.061
Miss?

40:16.295 --> 40:17.264
Miss?

40:18.130 --> 40:21.902
- Sorry. Um, here you go.
- Thanks. Wait...

40:22.501 --> 40:24.172
This won't work, it isn't Irish.

40:25.172 --> 40:27.074
We have three pins, not two.

40:28.175 --> 40:32.046
Shoot. Um, I actually know a way
to make it work. Can I try?

40:42.255 --> 40:43.257
Now, sir.

40:44.490 --> 40:46.391
Thanks for that. I appreciate
the trouble you've gone to.

40:46.393 --> 40:47.728
It's no problem.

40:50.664 --> 40:53.301
- I've had one hell of a day.
- Same here.

40:53.532 --> 40:54.868
It's my first shift.

40:55.902 --> 40:58.773
I'm just trying to get used
to all the night time stuff.

40:59.273 --> 41:01.639
Looks like neither of us are going
to get any sleep tonight then.

41:01.641 --> 41:04.041
Oh, I personally cannot wait

41:04.043 --> 41:06.846
to fall into bed and just...
pass out.

41:08.382 --> 41:09.784
What has you still awake?

41:11.117 --> 41:12.219
My wife is leaving me.

41:12.985 --> 41:14.719
I just had to get up
and get out,

41:14.721 --> 41:16.123
I'm too wound up to sleep.

41:16.722 --> 41:18.226
I'm really sorry to hear that.

41:19.693 --> 41:20.992
<i>Amy, are you all right?</i>

41:20.994 --> 41:22.563
<i>No inappropriate touching,
I hope.</i>

41:22.929 --> 41:24.999
Yes, Adam. I'm fine, thank you.

41:27.134 --> 41:30.972
I'm really sorry about him.
He's a bit of an ass.

41:31.570 --> 41:34.040
Yeah, I got that.
Thanks for the charger.

41:35.775 --> 41:37.041
Look if you need anything else,

41:37.043 --> 41:39.713
don't hesitate to contact
the front desk.

41:40.880 --> 41:41.848
Yeah.

42:13.746 --> 42:16.683
Hey, Adam?
All the lights are off up here.

42:16.983 --> 42:18.286
<i>Just... keep your cool.</i>

42:19.887 --> 42:21.122
<i>I'll stay here with you until
you're in the lift, all right?</i>

42:22.590 --> 42:25.092
I'm okay. I think the maid must've
turned it off on her way down.

42:25.759 --> 42:27.128
<i>A guest, is it?</i>

42:27.393 --> 42:28.760
No, I... I met a maid.

42:28.762 --> 42:30.595
She didn't really say
anything though.

42:30.597 --> 42:32.967
<i>There's no maid on tonight.</i>

42:33.432 --> 42:35.036
No, I definitely saw her.

42:35.335 --> 42:38.739
<i>Hmm, I'll just make
double sure on the roster.</i>

42:50.884 --> 42:53.454
Please. Help me. She's bleeding.

42:55.188 --> 42:56.824
<i>Amy? Hello?</i>

43:03.697 --> 43:04.899
Please, help.

43:06.766 --> 43:07.934
She's dying.

43:09.635 --> 43:11.038
Get the towels.

43:16.777 --> 43:19.746
You need to hold it to her neck,
like this.

43:29.356 --> 43:31.192
<i>Amy? Hello, Amy?</i>

43:31.525 --> 43:34.025
Adam, Adam you've got to call
an ambulance,

43:34.027 --> 43:35.726
there's a woman bleeding,
she's dying.

43:35.728 --> 43:37.230
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

43:37.597 --> 43:38.865
Call an ambulance now!

43:39.166 --> 43:41.733
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- Oh my God. Help, please.

43:41.735 --> 43:43.237
Please, she's bleeding!

43:44.704 --> 43:46.207
What the fuck is wrong with you?

43:46.405 --> 43:48.842
- <i>Amy, answer me.</i>
- Come on!

43:53.880 --> 43:56.180
- <i>Amy? Hello?</i>
- Oh, my God.

43:56.182 --> 43:58.085
- Oh, my God.
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>

44:00.920 --> 44:04.157
<i>Amy! For Christ's sake, talk,
hello?</i>

44:05.291 --> 44:08.128
<i>Hello? Can you hear me, Amy?
Amy?</i>

44:09.896 --> 44:13.033
<i>What's going on?
What's going on, Amy?</i>

44:15.969 --> 44:18.135
Adam?
Adam, something's happening.

44:18.137 --> 44:19.838
There... was a man here
and a woman,

44:19.840 --> 44:21.104
and now they're gone, and...

44:21.106 --> 44:23.273
the woman was bleeding
and I... I don't know,

44:23.275 --> 44:25.075
but the maid
had cuts on her back.

44:25.077 --> 44:26.878
<i>Amy, what are you talking about?</i>

44:26.880 --> 44:28.048
I need to go, Adam.

44:28.315 --> 44:32.219
This fucking lift!
Adam, please call the police.

44:32.452 --> 44:35.122
Somebody stabbed the woman.
Call the police.

44:35.588 --> 44:38.958
<i>The... stairs, Amy.
Amy, go for the stairs!</i>

45:06.085 --> 45:07.020
What?

45:12.324 --> 45:14.327
This makes no sense,
this make no...

45:20.266 --> 45:21.201
Help!

45:22.335 --> 45:23.336
Adam?

45:25.137 --> 45:26.139
What?

46:29.936 --> 46:31.572
Fuck.

47:29.061 --> 47:31.130
S... Somebody, please help.

48:39.532 --> 48:42.469
Hey, Adam.
Sorry I fell asleep.

48:49.175 --> 48:50.611
Adam, are you there?

48:51.277 --> 48:55.148
- <i>Yeah, Amy.</i>
- Hey, what time is it?

48:56.715 --> 48:58.152
<i>What does it matter?</i>

49:00.018 --> 49:02.155
Hilarious.
Seriously, what time is it?

49:05.492 --> 49:10.664
<i>He's coming for you.</i>

49:10.963 --> 49:12.865
Adam, that's not funny. Stop.

49:18.338 --> 49:22.943
<i>He's almost there, Amy.
Ooh!</i>

49:23.943 --> 49:26.947
<i>Well, Amy, it would seem
that you're the one in danger.</i>

49:27.246 --> 49:29.148
<i>Is that... Is that him?</i>

49:29.414 --> 49:31.782
<i>Is that him I hear
outside your door?</i>

49:31.784 --> 49:34.987
- Adam, stop it!
- <i>He's coming to kill you,</i>

49:35.420 --> 49:37.256
<i>unless you're already dead.</i>

50:09.822 --> 50:12.259
<i>It's not me,
it's him. Amy, help me.</i>

50:12.659 --> 50:15.496
<i>It's not me, it's him. Help me!</i>

50:27.974 --> 50:29.242
Get away from me.

50:29.876 --> 50:32.209
- No, no. No, no.
- Please, please, I didn't do anything!

50:32.211 --> 50:33.579
Listen to me!

50:34.146 --> 50:36.717
My name's Pete.
I'm here to help you.

50:37.083 --> 50:39.753
- What?
- We're trapped in the hotel.

50:40.686 --> 50:41.885
What is going on?

50:41.887 --> 50:43.790
That thing that happened
those ten years ago,

50:44.190 --> 50:45.692
that was just the beginning.

50:46.125 --> 50:47.728
I was one of his last victims.

50:47.994 --> 50:49.327
This isn't real.

50:49.329 --> 50:51.632
I can assure you it's very real.

50:52.130 --> 50:54.134
Look, I'm trapped,

50:54.534 --> 50:56.670
I'm in a cycle that I'm forced
to re-live.

50:58.137 --> 50:59.170
I'm dead?

50:59.172 --> 51:01.507
No, no. You're not dead,
not yet.

51:01.740 --> 51:03.673
- I'm here to help you.
- Why?

51:03.675 --> 51:06.413
Because I know the horrors
that these rooms hold.

51:13.719 --> 51:16.153
No, no. That's...
that's not going to work in here

51:16.155 --> 51:18.859
- Listen, what's your name?
- Amy.

51:19.057 --> 51:20.557
Okay, Amy, do you know anybody?

51:20.559 --> 51:22.496
Who's the last person
you spoke with?

51:22.728 --> 51:23.730
Um...

51:24.463 --> 51:26.232
Uh, the...
The old man and the woman.

51:26.498 --> 51:28.901
No good. They're like me,
we can't help 'em.

51:29.369 --> 51:34.771
Um... There's a guy in room 530.

51:34.773 --> 51:36.574
Okay, room 530, okay.

51:36.576 --> 51:38.742
We're gonna go to his room,
and we're going to get him.

51:38.744 --> 51:41.479
No, no, no, we need to stay
in here until the cops come,

51:41.481 --> 51:42.449
Adam called them.

51:43.583 --> 51:44.483
That's not gonna happen,
we're not in the living world.

51:44.817 --> 51:46.820
We're somewhere
kind of in between.

51:47.186 --> 51:50.190
Listen, you need to come
with me.

51:50.789 --> 51:52.726
I'm going to get you
out of here.

52:03.503 --> 52:05.905
Whatever you hear,
just keep moving.

52:16.416 --> 52:17.751
What did I say?
Come on.

52:25.525 --> 52:27.657
- What the hell is going on?
- We're trapped in the hotel.

52:27.659 --> 52:29.961
What do you mean trapped?
Who the hell are you?

52:29.963 --> 52:31.598
You need to listen to me.

52:31.965 --> 52:33.333
I'm one of the already dead.

52:33.967 --> 52:35.936
I want to stop you
from becoming like me.

52:36.268 --> 52:39.372
What? Jesus Christ.

52:39.806 --> 52:42.173
Now do you want to live,
or do you want to die?

52:42.175 --> 52:43.610
We're running out of time.

52:44.309 --> 52:45.478
Okay?

52:46.211 --> 52:47.614
- Okay.
- Okay then.

52:50.182 --> 52:52.686
This happens in a cycle.

52:53.652 --> 52:56.289
The only way for you two
to escape is through the lift.

52:56.556 --> 52:58.358
That's where the final victim
was killed.

52:58.724 --> 53:00.858
You try to stop him
and it all resets again

53:00.860 --> 53:02.628
and we're back
to where we started.

53:03.128 --> 53:04.130
What happened that night,

53:04.463 --> 53:06.766
is already happening again,
it's well underway.

53:07.432 --> 53:11.038
The final victim, she's gonna bang on
all the doors as she's being chased.

53:11.471 --> 53:13.806
Then she's going to press
the button for the lift.

53:14.507 --> 53:16.009
Only she can call it.

53:16.409 --> 53:18.641
- That is how you escape.
- What about you?

53:18.643 --> 53:21.714
I can't go. I've got my part
to play in all of this.

53:22.315 --> 53:23.713
Jesus Christ,
this thing is dead.

53:23.715 --> 53:25.081
That won't work, not in here.

53:25.083 --> 53:26.950
What do you mean
it won't work, not in here?

53:26.952 --> 53:29.552
Look, I just about had enough
of the two of you.

53:29.554 --> 53:32.255
All I wanted, was a room,
for the night, on my own.

53:32.257 --> 53:34.458
And the next thing the two
of you come barging in here.

53:34.460 --> 53:37.798
Look, I've had enough, get out.
Get out! Get out!

54:14.967 --> 54:15.969
Adam?

54:17.969 --> 54:19.505
Adam, can you hear me?

54:22.775 --> 54:23.777
Adam?

54:30.849 --> 54:33.185
<i>Amy? Amy, are you there?</i>

54:33.385 --> 54:35.054
Yes. Yes, Adam, I'm here.

54:35.521 --> 54:36.856
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

54:38.358 --> 54:41.124
I don't know, we're trapped there's somebody after us...

54:41.126 --> 54:43.195
<i>Did you really think
that was going to work?</i>

54:43.628 --> 54:46.098
<i>You're stuck, you stupid bitch.</i>

54:47.400 --> 54:50.369
- Why are you doing this?
- <i>It's not me.</i>

54:51.070 --> 54:54.041
<i>It's the big guy himself
from all those years ago.</i>

54:57.809 --> 54:59.779
<i>Now what are you going to do?</i>

54:59.978 --> 55:03.282
<i>It's just a little wait,
and then the real fun begins.</i>

55:03.815 --> 55:05.918
Listen to me, you sick bastard!

55:06.184 --> 55:08.454
- I don't know why you're doing this...
- Stop talking now!

55:08.653 --> 55:10.420
<i>Oh, the homeless fucker
is there,</i>

55:10.422 --> 55:12.491
<i>well that changes everything.</i>

55:13.992 --> 55:17.431
Why did you do that? We could have
used that to call somebody else!

55:17.630 --> 55:19.429
- That's not even your friend.
- What?

55:24.202 --> 55:25.838
Ah, shit.

55:26.338 --> 55:27.804
- <i>Help me, please!</i>
- What is that?

55:27.806 --> 55:29.442
- The last victim.
- <i>Please help me!</i>

55:29.641 --> 55:30.876
You've changed the cycle.

55:31.577 --> 55:33.344
If we leave her out there,
you're all dead.

55:33.346 --> 55:36.782
- <i>Help me, please!</i>
- She'll draw him straight here. Wait here.

55:38.518 --> 55:40.052
<i>Please help me!</i>

55:42.221 --> 55:43.255
You've gotta help me.

55:43.523 --> 55:44.988
He took my boyfriend
and he tried to kill me...

55:44.990 --> 55:48.994
Shh! You've gotta be quiet,
or he'll find us, okay? Shh.

55:49.528 --> 55:50.730
Why doesn't she remember
like you?

55:50.929 --> 55:53.396
She's stuck in her loop.
Sometimes it happens to me, too.

55:53.398 --> 55:56.266
What did you mean before when
you said I changed the cycle?

55:56.268 --> 55:57.767
You altered the timeline.

55:57.769 --> 56:00.039
That voice wasn't your friend,
it was him.

56:00.306 --> 56:01.240
He knows I'm helping you,

56:01.507 --> 56:03.543
that's the reason
why she's appeared here.

56:03.742 --> 56:06.545
- It's like a way of the timeline bouncing back.
- Dammit.

56:06.811 --> 56:09.048
Listen,
I'll guide you through this.

56:09.614 --> 56:11.517
Just follow me,
and do what I say.

56:12.117 --> 56:14.587
We need to go to a room where
the murders didn't take place,

56:14.786 --> 56:16.956
it makes it a little harder
for him to follow us.

56:17.322 --> 56:18.458
I'll go first...

56:18.757 --> 56:21.325
and you follow across the hall,
three doors down.

56:21.327 --> 56:22.395
No, I can't go back out there.

56:22.728 --> 56:24.498
- Don't make go back out there...
- What's your name?

56:24.797 --> 56:26.697
- Laurie.
- Laurie, okay, you stay with me.

56:26.699 --> 56:28.034
Okay, you can hold my hand.

56:29.534 --> 56:32.036
I have the master key and we'll outrun
him all night if we have to, okay?

56:32.038 --> 56:34.306
You stay with me.
Okay, let's go.

57:02.768 --> 57:04.804
- Go.
- The key won't work.

57:05.838 --> 57:07.574
I'll hold him off,
you know what to do.

57:07.806 --> 57:11.710
- We can't leave you.
- No, you can't save me.

58:05.731 --> 58:08.132
- Daddy.
- Don't look, honey.

58:08.134 --> 58:09.969
I... I'm scared.

58:27.753 --> 58:29.256
<i>Back to the start.</i>

58:40.065 --> 58:41.768
No! Dad!

58:45.237 --> 58:46.706
No...

59:09.327 --> 59:10.297
So what do we do now?

59:12.063 --> 59:14.333
- I don't know.
- What about the windows?

59:16.768 --> 59:19.204
They only open a few inches,
we tried them already.

59:44.195 --> 59:47.132
If we can't get out, we'll...
we'll get a message out.

59:47.733 --> 59:49.501
Wait,
won't that change things again?

59:49.802 --> 59:50.937
I don't know.

59:51.704 --> 59:53.306
I told Adam
to call the cops, but...

59:53.838 --> 59:55.974
I don't even know
if that was really him.

01:00:14.726 --> 01:00:16.995
We just have to...
hope it works.

01:00:48.626 --> 01:00:49.795
We're sitting ducks here.

01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:53.133
- We need to move.
- Where?

01:00:53.898 --> 01:00:56.233
- What?
- Where? Where are we gonna go?

01:00:56.235 --> 01:01:00.073
Just stop! Stop for a second,
let me think.

01:01:06.811 --> 01:01:08.781
Pete said that we...

01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:10.916
need to play it out
till the end...

01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:13.286
wait for Laurie
to call the elevator.

01:01:14.353 --> 01:01:15.387
I'm not following.

01:01:15.653 --> 01:01:17.791
We need to go to the room
closest to the elevator,

01:01:18.056 --> 01:01:21.326
and then Laurie, you call it,
and then...

01:01:22.094 --> 01:01:24.097
we wait in the room
until it comes.

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:26.729
Why does it have to be me?

01:01:26.731 --> 01:01:29.166
- It just has to be that way.
- I'm not going.

01:01:29.168 --> 01:01:30.900
Look Laurie,
I know it's not fair.

01:01:30.902 --> 01:01:32.738
Okay? But that's just
how it has to be.

01:01:33.005 --> 01:01:34.470
- I'm going to help you.
- No.

01:01:34.472 --> 01:01:35.572
- Laurie.
- No.

01:01:35.574 --> 01:01:37.143
Do you want to get out of here
or not?

01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:39.545
We'll all go.

01:01:50.556 --> 01:01:51.624
Okay.

01:03:24.282 --> 01:03:26.219
Something's not right,
we need to go.

01:03:47.505 --> 01:03:48.540
Quick, hide.

01:04:47.099 --> 01:04:49.202
No, no!

01:05:00.211 --> 01:05:06.284
No. No, no, Amy! Amy! Help me!
No! Help me!

01:05:09.822 --> 01:05:11.524
No! No! No!

01:05:12.858 --> 01:05:15.695
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No.

01:05:27.905 --> 01:05:30.539
No! No! No, no.

01:05:34.045 --> 01:05:35.881
No, no, no!

01:05:36.114 --> 01:05:37.449
No! No!

01:05:38.449 --> 01:05:39.451
No!

01:06:17.856 --> 01:06:19.258
No.

01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:20.593
No. No.

01:07:22.954 --> 01:07:24.523
Why are you doing this?

01:07:27.826 --> 01:07:28.927
Because...

01:07:30.061 --> 01:07:31.630
I take my job...

01:07:32.731 --> 01:07:33.666
very...

01:07:34.867 --> 01:07:36.369
very seriously.

01:07:52.016 --> 01:07:53.219
Adam?

01:07:59.791 --> 01:08:01.827
As you live and breathe.

01:08:07.699 --> 01:08:10.001
Well...

01:08:16.608 --> 01:08:19.444
It's you...
It's you from the front desk!

01:08:20.176 --> 01:08:22.747
Oh... you remembered me.

01:08:23.649 --> 01:08:25.451
Must have made an impression.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:29.822
You see...

01:08:30.287 --> 01:08:32.291
it's not about recreating
the murders.

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:33.993
That's not why we're here.

01:08:34.393 --> 01:08:37.863
We're creating
a whole new story, something...

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:40.765
that will live on,
beyond us all.

01:08:42.167 --> 01:08:43.469
Something like me.

01:08:56.846 --> 01:09:01.317
You sick fuck! You drew us here!
You made it happen like this!

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:04.756
No. No. No! Can't you see?

01:09:05.622 --> 01:09:07.792
It's not about this body.

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:11.063
It's not about this,
I am more than this.

01:09:11.496 --> 01:09:13.932
He is just a vessel.

01:09:17.336 --> 01:09:20.439
Sit down, don't be stupid,
sit the fuck down.

01:09:23.675 --> 01:09:24.810
Oh, here we go.

01:09:39.823 --> 01:09:42.827
I'm not going to beg you,
you piece of shit!

01:09:43.426 --> 01:09:44.997
I don't need you to.

01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:10.489
Don't worry, ladies,
not one drop will be wasted.

01:11:03.542 --> 01:11:04.710
Please.

01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:08.847
- Please, please!
- Come on, you need to hit the elevator.

01:11:09.146 --> 01:11:10.483
Laurie, come on!

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.719
I'm not stupid.

01:11:17.721 --> 01:11:19.621
If he catches you,
I can get away.

01:11:19.623 --> 01:11:22.193
I can change the cycle.
I'm sorry.

01:11:48.353 --> 01:11:50.722
Don't move.

01:13:44.269 --> 01:13:45.838
Amy, what the fuck?

01:13:58.515 --> 01:14:00.786
Police! Drop your weapon!

01:14:01.286 --> 01:14:02.755
Put your hands in the air!

01:14:04.421 --> 01:14:05.990
Put your hands in the air!

01:14:10.395 --> 01:14:12.428
Ma'am, drop the weapon!
We're armed!

01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:14.731
No, no. It's...
it's him you need.

01:14:14.733 --> 01:14:17.369
It's... It's him, it's not me.

01:14:17.569 --> 01:14:18.704
It's him!

01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:22.338
- <i>You have to get out.</i>
- Just make it through the night.

01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:24.210
Amy! Help me!

01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:25.678
Stay awake.

01:14:26.243 --> 01:14:27.376
<i>He killed them all!</i>

01:14:27.378 --> 01:14:28.646
Wait till morning.

01:14:29.413 --> 01:14:30.916
<i>I had to stop him!</i>

01:14:32.951 --> 01:14:34.784
- You can't save me.
- We'll all go.

01:14:34.786 --> 01:14:36.055
<i>I'm free now!</i>

01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:39.291
No. Please, please, no.

01:14:50.769 --> 01:14:53.739
<i>You try to stop him,
and it all resets again,</i>

01:14:54.139 --> 01:14:55.940
<i>and we're back
to where we started.</i>

01:14:56.474 --> 01:14:57.676
<i>I'm sorry, Amy.</i>

01:15:16.493 --> 01:15:17.762
<i>Welcome.</i>
