00:36.083 --> 00:37.414
Looking sharp, Mom.

00:37.451 --> 00:39.078
Hey, are you subbing today?

00:39.119 --> 00:40.347
Bobby, you know I am.

00:40.387 --> 00:43.185
You left me that message that
they want me to sub for Italian.

00:43.223 --> 00:44.850
Uh, no...

00:44.891 --> 00:49.828
I wanted an Italian sub
for lunch.

00:49.863 --> 00:51.888
Well, I'm all dressed up.

00:51.932 --> 00:54.264
I guess I could just shelve
books at the library

00:54.301 --> 00:55.825
till they throw me out.

00:55.869 --> 00:57.496
HANK:
Oh, dang it.

00:57.537 --> 00:59.903
Says here because
of high produce prices

00:59.940 --> 01:02.238
schools are yanking vegetables
from their menu.

01:02.275 --> 01:06.371
Man, first they get rid of the
organic garden, and now this.

01:06.413 --> 01:09.780
What is it with this school
and vegetables?

01:09.816 --> 01:11.078
PEGGY:
Organic garden?

01:11.118 --> 01:12.415
What organic garden?

01:12.452 --> 01:14.477
The coaches try to keep it
under wraps.

01:14.521 --> 01:16.989
You see, the kids who want
to get out of gym class

01:17.023 --> 01:18.718
can work in the garden instead.

01:18.759 --> 01:19.783
I just wish

01:19.826 --> 01:21.453
I'd found out about it sooner.

01:21.495 --> 01:24.931
Then I wouldn't have take
the Presidential Fitness Test.

01:24.965 --> 01:27.695
You'd rather work
in an organic garden

01:27.734 --> 01:30.999
than participate in
the Presidential Fitness Test?

01:31.037 --> 01:32.527
Where's your patriotism, boy?

01:32.572 --> 01:36.235
I hate doing the flexed-arm hang
in front of everyone.

01:36.276 --> 01:39.507
They call me T-Rex because
my arms can't support my weight.

01:39.546 --> 01:41.207
Bobby, the flexed-arm hang...

01:41.248 --> 01:42.840
I know, I know...

01:42.883 --> 01:47.149
Could mean the difference
between life and death.

01:47.187 --> 01:48.245
Doesn't matter anyway.

01:48.288 --> 01:51.689
Mr. Tomich is retiring
and the garden is closing.

01:51.725 --> 01:52.885
End of story.

01:52.926 --> 01:57.886
So, as you can see

01:57.931 --> 01:58.898
and smell,

01:58.932 --> 02:01.958
I am a very gifted gardener.

02:02.002 --> 02:07.167
Sorry, Peggy, but we’re not
looking to replace Mr. Tomich.

02:07.207 --> 02:09.937
See, nobody really needs
an organic garden.

02:09.976 --> 02:11.944
The football team,
on the other hand,

02:11.978 --> 02:13.946
could use more storage space
for their blocking sleds

02:13.980 --> 02:15.504
and old, broken helmets.

02:15.549 --> 02:17.039
Nice punt.

02:17.083 --> 02:19.347
I tell you,
this team's got something.

02:19.386 --> 02:20.876
Not like last year.

02:20.921 --> 02:22.889
Runts almost got me fired.

02:25.959 --> 02:29.451
What if the garden was working
for the football team?

02:29.496 --> 02:31.487
Football? I'm listening.

02:31.531 --> 02:33.499
My husband read in the paper
this morning

02:33.533 --> 02:35.057
about the veggie shortage.

02:35.101 --> 02:37.035
This team
needs their vitamins.

02:37.070 --> 02:39.504
How do you expect them
to make it to State

02:39.539 --> 02:41.837
without iceberg
on their hamburgers?

02:41.875 --> 02:43.308
If you put me in charge

02:43.343 --> 02:44.367
I will provide the team

02:44.411 --> 02:48.006
with the freshest vegetables
in Heimlich County.

02:48.048 --> 02:49.345
MOSS:
Tell you what, Peggy,

02:49.382 --> 02:50.679
I'll give you a shot.

02:50.717 --> 02:52.685
You do okay, we'll
talk permanent.

02:52.719 --> 02:53.981
And make sure
you grow kale.

02:54.020 --> 02:56.147
That new quarterback
we got loves kale.

02:56.189 --> 02:59.352
Hey, Dad, want to see me?
No.

02:59.392 --> 03:02.486
But you don't know what I...
No.

03:02.529 --> 03:05.589
Say hello
to Tom Landry Middle School's

03:05.632 --> 03:07.600
newest organic
gardening teacher.

03:07.634 --> 03:09.158
You saved the garden?

03:09.202 --> 03:10.965
Way to go, Mom!

03:11.004 --> 03:14.963
Mm-hmm. And now it will be
supplying fresh vegetables

03:15.008 --> 03:16.737
to the football team.

03:16.776 --> 03:17.743
Organic garden?

03:17.777 --> 03:19.642
That's what hippies eat.

03:19.679 --> 03:21.772
When was the last time
you saw a hippie

03:21.815 --> 03:24.010
that could take on
an offensive tackle?

03:24.050 --> 03:25.017
Oh, who cares?

03:25.051 --> 03:28.384
Hank, organic gardening
is terribly inefficient.

03:28.421 --> 03:30.252
It's a full-time job.

03:30.290 --> 03:32.190
It could be my full-time job.

03:32.225 --> 03:34.693
Good morning, class.

03:34.728 --> 03:40.530
I am your new gardening teacher,
Mrs. Hill.

03:40.567 --> 03:42.000
So, this is all of you?

03:42.035 --> 03:43.002
Uh-huh.

03:43.036 --> 03:45.004
Okay.

03:46.606 --> 03:47.868
Oh, this looks ripe.

03:47.908 --> 03:49.603
Let's get to work.

03:49.643 --> 03:50.610
BOBBY:
Work?

03:50.644 --> 03:53.044
Mom, you're embarrassing me.

03:53.079 --> 03:55.047
Mr. Tomich did
everything himself.

03:55.081 --> 03:56.048
Sometimes we picked stuff.

03:56.082 --> 03:58.050
Mostly we just sat around
and whatever.

03:58.084 --> 04:00.109
Well, there will be
no "whatevering"

04:00.153 --> 04:03.247
in Mrs. Hill's garden.

04:15.001 --> 04:21.338
Mmm. So that's why
people eat fruit.

04:21.374 --> 04:22.341
Mmm...

04:22.375 --> 04:25.469
Boy, look at those
jumping jacks.

04:25.512 --> 04:30.142
This is the year,
I tell you what.

04:30.183 --> 04:34.244
Hey, Mom, why are we bringing
all of this up to the field?

04:34.287 --> 04:37.279
So the cafeteria cooks
can’t steal our glory.

04:37.324 --> 04:39.155
Coming through.

04:39.192 --> 04:41.285
Make room for tomatoes so juicy

04:41.328 --> 04:43.694
you'll want to eat them
with a lifeguard.

04:43.730 --> 04:45.129
Organic goodness.

04:45.165 --> 04:47.190
Straight from
Mother Nature's womb.

04:47.233 --> 04:49.133
Uh, h-hey,
look over there.

04:49.169 --> 04:50.693
Who's got a stopwatch?

04:50.737 --> 04:54.195
Let's check out
the hang time
on that punter.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.674
Hey, Hank, that's some
fine-looking produce

04:56.710 --> 04:58.143
your boy's got there.

04:58.178 --> 05:00.146
Yeah, maybe it'll
give them enough juice

05:00.180 --> 05:02.444
to get off their
butts and hustle!

05:02.482 --> 05:06.043
Huh, I guess this stuff
does look pretty good.

05:06.086 --> 05:08.919
Looks a lot better
than that got-dang
special teams!

05:08.955 --> 05:12.686
Can’t catch a punt
to save their lives!

05:12.726 --> 05:14.523
Good work, kid.

05:14.561 --> 05:16.529
You know, I got
to admit, Peggy,

05:16.563 --> 05:17.530
this stuff looks so good

05:17.564 --> 05:20.556
I might have to became
a vegetarian.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.999
(chuckles)

05:22.035 --> 05:23.434
Not really.

05:23.470 --> 05:26.928
Look sharp, Bobby,
it's the coach.

05:26.973 --> 05:28.907
That's a heck of a
good-looking berry.

05:28.942 --> 05:30.910
Keep up the good work, son.

05:36.850 --> 05:38.374
"Keep up
the good work, son."

05:38.418 --> 05:41.751
Yep, that's what the coach said
to Bobby.

05:41.788 --> 05:44.279
And then when Bobby set out
those organic onions

05:44.324 --> 05:46.622
it was like he caught
a 32-yard pass.

05:46.660 --> 05:47.627
DALE:
What exactly

05:47.661 --> 05:48.787
are you trying to do, Hank?

05:48.828 --> 05:50.796
Turn our school
into some sort of

05:50.830 --> 05:53.264
bohemian Montessori
love-fest?

05:53.299 --> 05:54.323
No, it's not like that.

05:54.367 --> 05:57.734
It's not like the organic
gardening they did at Jonestown.

05:57.771 --> 05:59.170
It's more like farming.

05:59.205 --> 06:01.173
And you should have seen
the size of the crops.

06:01.207 --> 06:03.266
I tell you,
fora bunch of gym-dodgers,

06:03.309 --> 06:06.801
these kids
did a pretty decent job.

06:06.846 --> 06:08.814
Well, I guess
I'm going to head on in

06:08.848 --> 06:11.043
and watch some of
the Home and Garden network.

06:11.084 --> 06:12.847
It's Compost Week.

06:12.886 --> 06:15.855
Bobby and I are thinking of
making a batch for the team.

06:18.058 --> 06:22.427
(sighs)

06:22.462 --> 06:24.953
Dang it,
now I've got compost fever.

06:24.998 --> 06:25.987
Me, too.

06:26.032 --> 06:27.590
Maybe we could pitch in.

06:27.634 --> 06:29.158
Great idea.

06:29.202 --> 06:31.864
Now we need to find
some leftover food,

06:31.905 --> 06:34.840
lawn clippings,
dead leaves and coffee grounds

06:34.874 --> 06:37.741
that have been left to rot
fora long, long time.

06:41.014 --> 06:44.381
Just for the record, there is a
garbage can in there somewhere.

06:44.417 --> 06:48.581
You know what would make
this baby sing?

06:48.621 --> 06:51.852
Bat guano. Nature's Miracle-Gro.

06:51.891 --> 06:54.359
Where do you buy bat guano?
Sears?

06:54.394 --> 06:56.123
Yes. But it lacks

06:56.162 --> 06:59.256
the potency of straight-
out-of-the-bat feces.

06:59.299 --> 07:01.062
Nope, we have to go
right to the source.

07:01.101 --> 07:03.695
Mano-a-guano.

07:06.573 --> 07:09.064
"Gold Barsummersquash."

07:09.109 --> 07:11.373
Mmm.

07:11.411 --> 07:15.507
Ah! Mom, come here!

07:15.548 --> 07:16.708
Look at all these bugs.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.149
Oh.

07:18.184 --> 07:20.152
Mrs. Hill, Spencer
told me to tell you

07:20.186 --> 07:22.154
there's some weird
fungus on the turnips

07:22.188 --> 07:24.156
and I saw some snails
near the lettuce.

07:24.190 --> 07:25.157
I already
stepped on one.

07:25.191 --> 07:26.158
It was pretty cool.

07:26.192 --> 07:29.093
Oh, God. We have to feed these
to the football team today.

07:29.129 --> 07:30.096
Why did I promise them

07:30.130 --> 07:31.188
a field of greens?

07:31.231 --> 07:37.898
Die! Die! Die!

07:37.937 --> 07:39.928
Hey, everybody,
the cavalry's here.

07:39.973 --> 07:41.133
Bobby, show the coach

07:41.174 --> 07:42.141
what kind of ammo

07:42.175 --> 07:44.143
you've got for
our troops today.

07:44.177 --> 07:51.140
Oh, you know,
just more of the same.

07:51.184 --> 07:53.652
What the hell happened
to this carrot, son?

07:53.686 --> 07:57.315
I wouldn't feed it
to sixth grade J.V.

07:57.357 --> 08:01.657
Oh, this is terrible.

08:01.694 --> 08:03.958
Got anything else
for the team to eat?

08:03.997 --> 08:04.964
An old hubcap?

08:04.998 --> 08:06.090
A wadded-up newspaper?

08:06.132 --> 08:08.930
Peggy, I got to tell you,

08:08.968 --> 08:11.436
my job would be a lot easier
if you weren't feeding worms

08:11.471 --> 08:12.904
to the football team.

08:12.939 --> 08:14.907
I got to call
this garden thing off.

08:14.941 --> 08:17.068
No, you can't do that.

08:17.110 --> 08:18.236
Oh, man.

08:18.278 --> 08:22.374
I was practically
on the football team.

08:22.415 --> 08:23.541
Now, hold on, Carl.

08:23.583 --> 08:24.550
Can I remind you

08:24.584 --> 08:26.984
of the time the school board
wanted to fire

08:27.020 --> 08:29.989
a certain principal
for growing a ponytail?

08:30.023 --> 08:31.991
Well, Hank,
that was a long time ago.

08:32.025 --> 08:34.653
A lot of us said, "Yeah,
he looks like a jackass,

08:34.693 --> 08:36.662
but he deserves
another chance,"

08:36.696 --> 08:38.721
and that's all
we're asking for.

08:38.765 --> 08:39.890
(sighs)

08:39.933 --> 08:40.900
You got two weeks.

08:40.933 --> 08:44.370
BOY:
Hey, Coach, I
don't feel so...

08:44.404 --> 08:45.200
(vomits)

08:45.238 --> 08:48.537
One week.

08:53.346 --> 08:54.472
HANK:
Don't worry, Peggy,

08:54.514 --> 08:55.947
we'll turn that garden around.

08:55.982 --> 08:59.918
I have never seen a problem
teamwork couldn't fix.

08:59.953 --> 09:02.148
"Aphids. Worms."

09:02.188 --> 09:03.155
(disgusted sigh)

09:03.189 --> 09:05.783
Why does every book about
organic gardens

09:05.825 --> 09:07.156
have naked people in it?

09:07.193 --> 09:09.787
Well, this one has
three chapters on Nixon

09:09.829 --> 09:12.764
and nothing about bugs.

09:12.799 --> 09:14.357
So when they say
"Mother Earth"

09:14.400 --> 09:15.958
they mean dirt, right?

09:16.002 --> 09:17.970
I'm not sure, but wait,
listen to this:

09:18.004 --> 09:20.302
"Snails are attracted
to the smell of beer.

09:20.340 --> 09:24.106
They will follow the scent,
fall into the beer and drown."

09:24.143 --> 09:25.508
Just like Judy Garland.

09:25.545 --> 09:28.981
HANK:
Okay, here we are.

09:29.015 --> 09:31.108
What a... uh...

09:31.150 --> 09:33.277
great-looking group of kids
this is.

09:33.319 --> 09:35.514
This isn't all of them,
is it?

09:35.555 --> 09:42.017
Uh, so how many of you have
ever tried out for a team?

09:42.061 --> 09:44.427
And how many of you have ever
been picked for a team?

09:44.464 --> 09:46.398
Uh... okay then.

09:46.432 --> 09:49.799
Well, I'm forming a team.

09:49.836 --> 09:50.803
The Garden Team.

09:50.837 --> 09:53.704
And you're all
my first-round draft picks.

09:53.740 --> 09:56.436
All right!
I'm playing for my dad.

09:56.476 --> 09:59.001
With your permission,
I'd like to lead us in a cheer.

09:59.045 --> 10:00.205
Give me a...

10:00.246 --> 10:01.372
Permission denied.

10:01.414 --> 10:04.577
Now, if we're going to be
a team,

10:04.617 --> 10:09.020
we got to play together
and give it all we got.

10:09.055 --> 10:14.288
So let's get in there and show
these bugs we mean business.

10:14.327 --> 10:15.487
(all cheer)

10:15.528 --> 10:18.725
Last call for beer,
you little garden munchers.

10:18.765 --> 10:23.168
You don't have to go home,
but you cannot stay here.

10:23.202 --> 10:25.170
Now, supposedly
these milk cartons

10:25.204 --> 10:29.538
will help protect the base of
the plants from crawling bugs,

10:29.575 --> 10:32.772
"which are all beautiful
in their own way."

10:32.812 --> 10:33.779
Queen Amidala,

10:33.813 --> 10:37.214
I will save you
from the Dark Side.

10:37.250 --> 10:38.217
(sighs)

10:38.251 --> 10:40.446
If there were more than
one garden team,

10:40.486 --> 10:41.919
we'd be in last place.

10:41.955 --> 10:43.946
BOBBY:
Quit screwing around, guys.

10:43.990 --> 10:47.391
And forget about
Queen Amidala and
the Dark Side.

10:47.427 --> 10:49.987
Who's saving these cucumbers
from aphids?

10:50.029 --> 10:55.433
DALE:
Boy, it's true what they say
about the Denton Flea Market.

10:55.468 --> 10:57.436
You really can get
anything there.

10:57.470 --> 11:00.030
So how much guano
have you collected so far?

11:00.073 --> 11:03.201
None. But I've been feeding it
bugs and prunes

11:03.242 --> 11:05.733
and massaging its colon
for the past two days,

11:05.778 --> 11:08.110
so the flood gates
are about to open.

11:08.147 --> 11:12.311
Build an ark, boys.

11:17.890 --> 11:20.688
We're going to need more bats.

11:24.464 --> 11:25.431
Andrew,

11:25.465 --> 11:27.433
how many times
do I have to tell you,

11:27.467 --> 11:28.900
the weed puller
is for...

11:28.935 --> 11:29.902
pulling weeds.

11:29.936 --> 11:31.369
Oh, good job.

11:35.842 --> 11:39.141
Dang it, Rain,
I don't think your
extract of hippie

11:39.178 --> 11:40.611
is going to help
our garden.

11:40.713 --> 11:43.841
Actually, these are ashes
from our wood stove at home.

11:43.883 --> 11:45.942
They discourage slugs
and cutworms.

11:46.953 --> 11:49.217
Rain, you have just
earned yourself

11:49.288 --> 11:50.414
a high five.

11:51.657 --> 11:53.750
Come on, don't
leave me hanging.

12:01.467 --> 12:03.162
Hank, why isn't
this working?

12:03.202 --> 12:05.432
Damn it, these bugs
are eating my career.

12:05.471 --> 12:08.599
Peggy, I had my doubts about
this whole organic thing, too,

12:08.641 --> 12:10.609
but if the old
gardening teacher

12:10.643 --> 12:11.837
pulled it off,
then so can we.

12:11.878 --> 12:13.004
Look at these kids.

12:13.046 --> 12:15.913
They're actually
working as a team.

12:15.948 --> 12:16.915
Slow down, Tommy.

12:16.949 --> 12:17.916
Save some water

12:17.950 --> 12:18.917
for the plants.

12:18.951 --> 12:20.919
PEGGY:
Mr. Tomlch

12:20.953 --> 12:22.887
I don't know how
you did it.

12:22.922 --> 12:25.550
I tried every organic trick
in the book.

12:25.591 --> 12:29.220
Soapy water, pepper spray,
tobacco, cotton balls,

12:29.262 --> 12:30.889
pecan shells, ladybugs...

12:30.930 --> 12:32.921
and I got jack.

12:32.965 --> 12:36.901
How about Methyl isothiocyanate?

12:36.936 --> 12:39.131
That wasn't in my organic
gardening book.

12:39.172 --> 12:40.139
What is it?

12:40.173 --> 12:41.970
Avery powerful pesticide.

12:42.008 --> 12:43.976
Just be sure not to get
any on your hands.

12:44.010 --> 12:45.807
But... but the
whole point

12:45.845 --> 12:48.507
is to teach kids
about organic gardening.

12:48.548 --> 12:50.846
That's why you don't
tell anybody.

12:50.883 --> 12:54.250
Oh, my God,
you grew a garden of lies.

12:54.287 --> 12:56.847
Yes, and tomatoes the size
of your cranium.

12:56.889 --> 13:00.052
Look, if you want
to keep your garden
and your job,

13:00.093 --> 13:01.424
you got to use pesticides.

13:01.461 --> 13:04.294
What do you think is keeping
termites from eating this deck?

13:04.330 --> 13:06.025
Love?

13:33.059 --> 13:35.687
Dad, look at the size
of this one!

13:35.728 --> 13:36.956
If Gallagher smashed it,

13:36.996 --> 13:39.692
it would reach all the way
to the back of the room.

13:39.732 --> 13:44.669
You see, Peggy, you didn't have
faith, but look at his place.

13:44.704 --> 13:45.671
(sighs)

13:45.705 --> 13:47.673
Is there anything
beer can't do?

13:47.707 --> 13:48.765
Uh... uh-huh, you're right.

13:48.808 --> 13:51.174
I know this stuff is
for the football team,

13:51.210 --> 13:52.768
but it just looks so good,

13:52.812 --> 13:54.780
I'm going to have
to try a sample.

13:54.814 --> 13:55.940
Hank, no! No!

13:55.982 --> 13:57.973
It... it's for
the football team.

13:58.017 --> 13:59.882
And don’t touch
your eyes.

13:59.919 --> 14:02.251
DALE:
According to the nice lady

14:02.288 --> 14:03.880
at the Flying Mammal Society,

14:03.923 --> 14:05.015
this bridge is home

14:05.057 --> 14:07.150
to more than 30,000 bats.

14:07.193 --> 14:09.252
Even if half of them
are constipated,

14:09.295 --> 14:12.287
it's still a gold mine.

14:12.331 --> 14:16.461
Oh, man, got dang ol'
P and ol' U, man.

14:16.502 --> 14:18.299
Oh, God, it's awful.

14:18.337 --> 14:20.828
(deep breaths)

14:20.873 --> 14:22.773
(Bill screeching)

14:22.808 --> 14:25.936
DALE:
The floor is slippery.

14:25.978 --> 14:28.538
That's a good sign.

14:28.581 --> 14:29.548
Boomhauer, get ready.

14:29.582 --> 14:31.049
I think I hear something.

14:31.083 --> 14:32.311
(plop)

14:32.351 --> 14:33.545
Yes!

14:33.586 --> 14:34.780
(plopping)

14:34.820 --> 14:36.651
Picking up...

14:36.689 --> 14:38.520
(rapid plopping)

14:38.558 --> 14:39.786
Uh-oh.

14:39.825 --> 14:41.019
(squeaking)

14:41.060 --> 14:46.623
Oh, God, we've awakened
a sleeping, pooping giant!

14:46.666 --> 14:47.860
(screaming)

14:47.900 --> 14:52.837
I've got a bat
in my mouth!

14:52.872 --> 14:54.100
(screaming)

14:54.140 --> 14:56.836
HANK:
Listen up, team.

14:56.876 --> 14:58.309
I just wanted to tell you all

14:58.344 --> 14:59.868
how proud I am.

14:59.912 --> 15:02.540
You've overcome the elements,
the bugs

15:02.582 --> 15:04.914
and God knows,
your own limitations.

15:04.951 --> 15:06.578
I got
heat stroke.

15:06.619 --> 15:07.813
Look at this.

15:07.853 --> 15:09.252
I thought it was a tumor,

15:09.288 --> 15:13.588
but Mom said it was
a callus.

15:13.626 --> 15:15.594
And since you guys
are working like a team,

15:15.628 --> 15:19.758
I figured it's about time
you looked like one.

15:19.799 --> 15:20.766
(all gasping)

15:20.800 --> 15:23.428
Yep, team jerseys.

15:23.469 --> 15:25.437
Bobby, you keep up
the good work

15:25.471 --> 15:27.496
and I might have to sew
a "C" on the jersey

15:27.540 --> 15:30.304
for Captain.

15:30.343 --> 15:34.541
(yawns)

15:36.716 --> 15:40.948
(coughing)

15:40.987 --> 15:43.080
Oh...

15:43.122 --> 15:47.821
All right, team.

15:47.860 --> 15:49.885
Early bird
kills the worm.

15:49.929 --> 15:51.055
Peggy?

15:51.097 --> 15:54.464
What?! What?!

15:57.069 --> 16:04.840
(all gasping)

16:04.877 --> 16:06.469
Peggy, what are you doing?

16:06.512 --> 16:09.447
Well, I...
I was just vacuuming?

16:09.482 --> 16:11.450
That's a skull
and crossbones sticker.

16:11.484 --> 16:12.451
It says, "Warning: Poison."

16:12.485 --> 16:16.444
All right, I've been
spraying pesticides.

16:16.489 --> 16:19.185
But, Peggy, this is
an organic garden.

16:19.225 --> 16:22.160
Using chemicals is the only
thing you're not allowed to do.

16:22.194 --> 16:23.593
Oh, come on, Hank.

16:23.629 --> 16:26.154
How else do you think
it was able to grow so well?

16:26.198 --> 16:27.460
You mean it wasn’t us?

16:27.500 --> 16:29.695
The team?

16:29.735 --> 16:33.330
And I already thanked God
fora bountiful harvest.

16:33.372 --> 16:36.466
He must think I'm an idiot.

16:36.509 --> 16:37.771
Well, I had no choice.

16:37.810 --> 16:40.108
You can't get
anything good
without chemicals.

16:40.146 --> 16:44.344
Chemicals are what keep
my hair so high and brown.

16:44.383 --> 16:47.944
Hank? Hank!

16:47.987 --> 16:49.978
Screw helping
the football team.

16:50.022 --> 16:51.353
If they want guano,

16:51.390 --> 16:54.416
they can crawl through hell
getting it like we did.

16:54.460 --> 16:56.155
I had to burn my favorite Levis

16:56.195 --> 16:58.925
and a hat that was perfectly
molded to my head.

16:58.964 --> 16:59.931
Step right up, man.

16:59.965 --> 17:03.025
Get a little ol' guano
just like them dang ol'
Egyptians, man.

17:03.069 --> 17:04.934
Gonna change your life, man.

17:04.970 --> 17:07.369
Jus-just guaranteed
to be fresh too, man.

17:07.406 --> 17:08.373
You, sir,

17:08.406 --> 17:11.467
why are you afraid
to take the guano challenge?

17:11.510 --> 17:14.377
Are you afraid it might
rock your world?

17:14.413 --> 17:15.471
Coward!

17:15.513 --> 17:21.474
So Principal Moss pulled
the plug on the garden.

17:25.358 --> 17:27.848
The football team is moving
their blocking sleds

17:27.893 --> 17:29.485
over there next week.

17:29.528 --> 17:32.122
Good. I'm on a god dang
mailing list

17:32.164 --> 17:34.758
for an organic food store now.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.292
To think I shopped
at a place called Passages.

17:38.337 --> 17:41.829
I guess the garden team has
one more game left, huh, Dad.

17:41.874 --> 17:44.138
Harvesting the last crop.

17:44.176 --> 17:46.144
There never was any garden team.

17:46.178 --> 17:48.078
This was just
your mother,

17:48.114 --> 17:50.309
the cheater, spraying
her cheater juice

17:50.349 --> 17:51.316
all over the place.

17:51.350 --> 17:52.817
No, it wasn’t.

17:52.852 --> 17:54.843
We worked hard
on that garden.

17:54.887 --> 17:56.354
Who knows what we really did.

17:56.389 --> 17:59.415
It's like we all got caught
using steroids.

17:59.458 --> 18:01.426
The only honorable thing
left to do

18:01.460 --> 18:05.954
is forfeit
and get off the field.

18:12.671 --> 18:13.933
What are you
doing, Bobby?

18:13.973 --> 18:15.065
The garden team's dead.

18:15.107 --> 18:17.075
We should just set fire
to the whole thing

18:17.109 --> 18:18.133
and watch it burn.

18:18.177 --> 18:19.371
We planted this garden,

18:19.412 --> 18:21.380
and we worked hard
to make it grow.

18:21.414 --> 18:23.382
Now, there's one more
harvest left,

18:23.416 --> 18:26.749
and the snails are going to have
to go through me to get it.

18:55.781 --> 18:56.748
He's open.

18:56.782 --> 18:58.147
He's open!

18:58.184 --> 18:59.811
He... Goddangit!

18:59.852 --> 19:03.185
Oh, look who it is...
Hippie Hill.

19:03.222 --> 19:06.521
Hey, Granola, what's your boy
doing in the garden over there?

19:06.559 --> 19:08.584
Dang it, Bobby.

19:08.627 --> 19:10.595
All right, I'll go
make sure they're gone

19:10.629 --> 19:11.687
before the football team

19:11.730 --> 19:13.698
brings over
their blocking sleds.

19:13.732 --> 19:16.223
Keep it up, team.

19:16.268 --> 19:19.032
It's the fifth quarter

19:19.071 --> 19:21.062
and time's
running out.

19:21.106 --> 19:22.971
I know you're tired and sore,

19:23.008 --> 19:26.739
but if we don't bring these
vegetables in, no one will.

19:26.779 --> 19:29.577
So keep picking till
you can't pick anymore,

19:29.615 --> 19:31.549
and then pick one more.

19:31.584 --> 19:33.882
Try planting this.

19:33.919 --> 19:36.183
It's raining pain.

19:36.222 --> 19:37.189
Incoming.

19:37.223 --> 19:39.191
They're coming.
They always come.

19:39.225 --> 19:40.192
My glasses.

19:40.226 --> 19:41.193
Move it!
Move it!

19:41.227 --> 19:42.751
If there's something

19:42.795 --> 19:45.355
in your way, run over it.

19:45.397 --> 19:47.490
Get out of the way,
garden dorks.

19:47.533 --> 19:53.494
Why, Dad? Why?

19:57.209 --> 19:58.608
I don't think so.

19:58.644 --> 20:00.236
These kids have worked hard,

20:00.279 --> 20:02.247
and this is what's
going to happen.

20:02.281 --> 20:04.249
They're going to harvest
their vegetables,

20:04.283 --> 20:05.250
you guys are going
to eat 'em,

20:05.284 --> 20:07.684
and then you're
going to say thank you.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.709
Move 'em, Hank.

20:08.754 --> 20:11.348
These cupcakes don't
belong on the football field.

20:11.390 --> 20:13.358
You guys know I can
play running back,

20:13.392 --> 20:16.225
but I can block, too.

20:16.262 --> 20:19.026
As I recall, Rick, you were
a tennis player, right?

20:28.173 --> 20:32.166
All right, come on,
let's get back to practice.

20:42.755 --> 20:44.882
We have been working on
this garden for a week,

20:44.924 --> 20:47.119
and I tried to resist, but...

20:47.159 --> 20:50.151
Dad, give me
a wheelbarrow ride!

20:50.195 --> 20:53.687
Okay, quick, get in.

20:53.732 --> 20:57.498
PEGGY:
Can I help?

20:57.536 --> 20:59.265
I've gone straight. I swear.

20:59.305 --> 21:00.863
I'm done with chemicals.

21:00.906 --> 21:02.567
I didn't even use
any shampoo

21:02.608 --> 21:04.701
or soap or deodorant
this morning.

21:04.743 --> 21:12.343
Smell me.

21:12.384 --> 21:14.284
You can help step on beetles.

21:14.320 --> 21:15.685
But I got to warn you,

21:15.721 --> 21:17.689
the ones that
survive the poisons

21:17.723 --> 21:18.690
are really tough.
