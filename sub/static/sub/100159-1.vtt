01:36.916 --> 01:40.791
<i>When I was young, I thought
house painters painted houses.</i>

01:42.375 --> 01:43.625
<i>What did I know?</i>

01:44.458 --> 01:46.375
<i>I was a working guy.</i>

01:46.916 --> 01:51.791
<i>A business agent for Teamster Local 107
out of South Philly.</i>

01:51.875 --> 01:54.375
One of a thousand working stiffs...

01:57.000 --> 01:58.750
until I wasn't no more.

02:00.791 --> 02:01.750
And then...

02:03.041 --> 02:04.833
I started painting houses...

02:06.875 --> 02:07.916
myself.

02:24.041 --> 02:27.875
<i>In this particular matter, the whole
thing was built around the wedding.</i>

02:31.250 --> 02:34.125
Bill Bufalino's daughter
was getting married in Detroit.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.750
Bill was a Teamster lawyer,
but more important,

02:36.833 --> 02:38.708
he was Russell Bufalino's cousin.

02:40.166 --> 02:42.500
<i>Russell didn't want to fly,</i>

02:42.583 --> 02:45.833
<i>so I was gonna drive him
to the wedding.</i>

02:46.458 --> 02:48.625
<i>He wanted to take care of
some business along the way,</i>

02:48.708 --> 02:51.750
<i>which in Russell's case
meant only one thing:</i>

02:52.416 --> 02:54.333
<i>Money... collecting it.</i>

02:54.416 --> 02:55.750
<i>So, we'd drive.</i>

02:55.833 --> 02:59.708
<i>Him and his wife Carrie
and me and my wife Irene.</i>

02:59.791 --> 03:01.250
<i>I call her Reenie.</i>

03:02.458 --> 03:05.958
<i>I figured we would take 476
out of Philly,</i>

03:06.041 --> 03:07.416
<i>then up to Pittston</i>

03:07.500 --> 03:09.666
<i>and pick up Russ which is what we did,</i>

03:10.333 --> 03:13.416
<i>and then Interstate 80 West...</i>

03:14.000 --> 03:18.875
<i>through Pennsylvania,
and then across Ohio to Toledo,</i>

03:19.666 --> 03:22.625
<i>and then we would go 75 North to Detroit.</i>

03:26.208 --> 03:31.625
<i>It would take about three days with all
the business breaks and cigarette stops.</i>

03:31.708 --> 03:33.916
<i>Russell didn't allow nobody
to smoke in the car.</i>

03:34.958 --> 03:37.750
<i>He says Jimmy Blue Eyes and Meyer Lansky</i>

03:37.833 --> 03:40.333
<i>convinced him to stop smoking when
they were kicked out</i>

03:40.416 --> 03:43.541
<i>of their casinos in Cuba
and getting shot at by Castro.</i>

03:44.291 --> 03:46.250
<i>I don't know. Maybe it was:</i>

03:46.333 --> 03:49.750
<i>"Please-God-if-I-ever-
get-out-of-this-fucking-thing-alive-</i>

03:49.833 --> 03:51.583
<i>-I'll-never-smoke-again."</i>

03:51.666 --> 03:53.416
<i>But I do know that,</i>

03:53.500 --> 03:58.750
<i>from Castro on, Russ wouldn't allow nobody
to smoke in his car, not even Carrie.</i>

04:17.166 --> 04:19.166
Can we stop soon?

04:21.416 --> 04:23.666
We're only in the car two minutes, honey.

04:24.291 --> 04:26.000
We're not even near the highway.

04:26.083 --> 04:29.041
I know.
But you don't like to stop on the highway.

04:30.333 --> 04:33.916
It's not that so much. They don't <i>let </i> you
stop on the highway.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.250
Okay, so then we'll smoke in the car.

04:38.958 --> 04:40.333
What about my cataracts?

04:42.041 --> 04:43.666
I'll crack the window.

04:46.083 --> 04:46.916
Carrie,

04:47.500 --> 04:49.541
I made a vow. Remember?

04:49.625 --> 04:51.458
Remember I made a vow, Carrie?

04:51.541 --> 04:52.708
Yeah, now I can't smoke.

04:53.875 --> 04:55.958
All right, and now I can't smoke.

05:15.041 --> 05:16.041
See where we are?

05:22.125 --> 05:22.958
Is that?

05:24.791 --> 05:26.291
What are those odds?

06:28.833 --> 06:30.416
What's the problem, kid?

06:34.083 --> 06:38.791
I don't... I don't know. It sounds funny.
It stops, it starts, it loses power.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.208
Let me see if I can give you a hand.

06:46.416 --> 06:47.583
Check all these plugs.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.083
Spark plugs are okay.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.875
The distributor cap's okay.

06:54.791 --> 06:56.791
It's gotta be something with with this.

06:57.708 --> 06:58.833
Timing chain.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.250
This is what this is. There's a cap on it.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.833
This cap is loose.
It ain't supposed to be loose.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.958
So that means they're getting worn out.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.166
Try that now. Tighten It up.

07:15.458 --> 07:16.291
All right?

07:17.125 --> 07:18.875
I can drive 'em. I can't fix 'em.

07:19.666 --> 07:21.375
You're back in business, kid.

07:24.958 --> 07:26.333
I owe you anything?

07:26.416 --> 07:28.708
No, you don't owe me anything.
It's all right.

07:29.625 --> 07:32.166
-Frank.
-Hey, Frank. How ya doing?

07:35.041 --> 07:36.041
What's your name?

07:39.583 --> 07:40.625
Where you from?

07:41.708 --> 07:43.416
-Philly.
-Oh, you're from Philly.

07:46.375 --> 07:47.958
Where you hang out there?

07:48.833 --> 07:49.958
Callahan's.

07:50.458 --> 07:53.375
Bocce Club. It's a bar not a bocce club.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.833
Oh, yeah. You play bocce?

07:55.916 --> 07:57.041
Nah.

07:58.291 --> 08:01.208
All right, Frankie, get that fixed.

08:01.291 --> 08:03.625
-Because it'll go again on you.
-Thank you.

08:03.708 --> 08:05.750
-I will. Thanks again.
-Good luck, buddy.

08:08.375 --> 08:09.708
<i>I thought maybe he owned</i>

08:09.791 --> 08:11.166
the gas station.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.125
He owned something, you could tell.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.666
Yeah, it turns out
he owned the whole road.

08:37.332 --> 08:38.207
This one?

08:42.416 --> 08:43.500
Drink up, fellas.

08:44.082 --> 08:45.125
God bless.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.166
Let's go. Let's make some money.

08:48.833 --> 08:50.125
It's a bar.

08:50.208 --> 08:51.416
Say hello to your wife.

08:52.416 --> 08:55.750
I got a way
we can push those hindquarters.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.500
There's a guy in here, he'll pay
a lot of money for them.

08:58.583 --> 09:00.291
Let's shoot this first.

09:03.041 --> 09:05.083
At the other end of the bar
at twelve o'clock.

09:05.166 --> 09:07.041
He's got a rescinding hairline.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.208
You'll make a lot of money with him.

09:09.291 --> 09:11.291
Skinny Razor. He owns the place.

09:11.375 --> 09:12.458
Razor?

09:12.541 --> 09:14.708
He shylocks and runs a book
out of the joint.

09:14.791 --> 09:16.833
He's got good connections.

09:17.708 --> 09:18.708
Razor's his name?

09:19.208 --> 09:20.458
He used to work at a butcher shop.

09:24.166 --> 09:27.041
My friend Frank Irish is here.
The one I told you about.

09:29.458 --> 09:31.708
-The truck.
-Yeah, hindquarters.

09:32.583 --> 09:33.500
Frank Sheeran.

09:35.291 --> 09:36.333
You like steak?

09:37.708 --> 09:38.791
I do.

09:38.875 --> 09:40.083
I deliver steak.

09:40.958 --> 09:41.958
Do ya?

09:42.041 --> 09:43.083
Good steak.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.458
I could deliver you steak.

09:48.958 --> 09:50.666
-Could ya?
-I could.

09:51.666 --> 09:54.250
Good price, too. The best.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.208
-We'll talk later.
-Okay.

09:57.750 --> 09:58.833
Thanks, Skinny.

10:03.250 --> 10:04.833
It's freezing out there.

10:04.916 --> 10:06.291
I don't mind it.

10:06.375 --> 10:07.500
I hate it.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.166
When you go outside...

10:11.500 --> 10:12.833
put the seal on.

10:15.625 --> 10:18.500
-All right. I gotta go out anyway.
-I owe you one.

11:23.541 --> 11:24.541
There you go, Frank.

11:25.416 --> 11:27.458
-See you next time.
-Thanks, Tony.

11:29.791 --> 11:31.125
Much better, Frank.

11:32.125 --> 11:35.125
I don't go near Choice.
I only do Prime.

11:35.208 --> 11:36.666
Can I get more next Tuesday?

11:37.250 --> 11:38.416
How many you want?

11:40.208 --> 11:41.375
At least five.

11:43.791 --> 11:44.833
Five you got.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.000
What the fuck is this?

12:08.625 --> 12:09.916
Tony, I don't...

12:10.000 --> 12:12.166
-What the fuck is this, Frank?
-I don't know.

12:14.916 --> 12:16.541
I don't load the truck.

12:16.625 --> 12:19.916
The loaders are supposed to load it.
Maybe they didn't do their work.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.458
You didn't realize you were driving
a light horse?

12:22.958 --> 12:24.333
It felt fine.

12:24.416 --> 12:26.625
Come on, Frank. Come on.

12:26.708 --> 12:29.250
I'm telling you. I... I...

12:29.333 --> 12:33.125
God's truth. I just don't know what
happened. Maybe some...

12:36.916 --> 12:38.708
-It's empty.
-I know it is.

12:40.041 --> 12:41.166
I know it is.

12:41.916 --> 12:44.250
What are you looking at? Go back to work.

12:44.750 --> 12:45.916
All of youse!

12:47.916 --> 12:49.583
What can I tell the boss?

12:50.458 --> 12:53.166
Just don't look at me 'cause I...

12:53.250 --> 12:54.458
Who else can I look at?

12:54.958 --> 12:56.666
It's not gonna be on me, Frank.

12:57.458 --> 12:58.791
I just drive the truck.

12:58.875 --> 13:01.458
Frank Sheeran. Did I say that right?

13:03.250 --> 13:06.375
Under the contract, thanks to Jimmy Hoffa,

13:07.291 --> 13:09.708
a driver can only be fired
on very specific charges.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.125
-Were you ever late?
-No.

13:13.208 --> 13:14.958
-Do you have any moving violations?
-No.

13:15.041 --> 13:16.791
-Do you drink on the job?
-No.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.250
Ever hit anybody?

13:18.333 --> 13:19.166
On the job?

13:21.916 --> 13:23.666
Stealing, is that grounds?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.250
Can they prove it?

13:28.375 --> 13:29.625
I don't think so.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.375
Then there's nothing to worry about.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.666
If they can prove it,

13:36.250 --> 13:38.833
they're just gonna
want names. Accomplices.

13:38.916 --> 13:41.000
You give them some names, you go home.

13:41.458 --> 13:42.583
Keep your job.

13:43.625 --> 13:44.666
How about that?

13:44.750 --> 13:46.083
Would you give them names?

13:47.041 --> 13:48.208
No names.

13:52.500 --> 13:57.416
I don't care if you did it or not.
That makes no difference to me.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.041
I'm here to defend you. Right?

14:06.250 --> 14:08.166
So you want to know if I did it or not?

14:11.041 --> 14:13.083
I'm gonna defend you either way.

14:16.250 --> 14:19.958
I work hard for them when I'm...
I ain't stealing from 'em.

14:22.250 --> 14:23.750
<i>Your Honor, if this was about</i>

14:23.833 --> 14:27.333
right or wrong, the company would have
sought Mr. Sheeran's dismissal.

14:27.416 --> 14:28.541
They didn't.

14:28.625 --> 14:32.541
They accused Mr. Sheeran because
they hoped he could name conspirators

14:32.625 --> 14:35.500
which he couldn't do
because they don't exist.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.750
They don't exist
because he didn't steal anything.

14:38.833 --> 14:42.375
He didn't steal anything
because he's an exemplary employee,

14:42.458 --> 14:45.666
who, in eight years, has never taken
a day of sick leave.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.375
The only rule he ever broke
is his own union's,

14:48.458 --> 14:51.833
by helping others carry sides of beef
from his truck

14:51.916 --> 14:54.791
to their refrigerators
in the dead of winter.

14:57.458 --> 14:58.458
All rise.

14:58.541 --> 14:59.666
Court is in session.

15:00.958 --> 15:02.875
I'm dismissing this case with a warning.

15:02.958 --> 15:04.333
Yes, Your Honor.

15:04.416 --> 15:05.750
No, not you, Mr. Sheeran.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.375
You bring another working man
before this court

15:08.458 --> 15:11.750
with threats instead of evidence,
believe me, you'll be sorry.

15:11.833 --> 15:14.291
If I owned stock in this company,
I would sell it.

15:15.750 --> 15:16.625
<i>I don't know how he did it</i>

15:16.708 --> 15:19.208
<i>and I ain't gonna ask. All I know is</i>

15:19.291 --> 15:21.708
<i>that Bill Bufalino got me out of a case</i>

15:21.791 --> 15:24.250
<i>I should never have gotten away with.</i>

15:24.333 --> 15:25.666
<i>I should've been down for the count.</i>

15:25.750 --> 15:27.916
They're gonna appreciate
what you did today.

15:29.291 --> 15:31.166
They got families, they got kids.

15:32.041 --> 15:33.416
They need those jobs.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.250
<i>Instead, we went out celebrating...</i>

15:37.916 --> 15:41.708
<i>and I met what was gonna turn out to be
the rest of my life.</i>

15:41.791 --> 15:43.791
I thought that was you walking in outside.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.916
Can I introduce you to this new guy Frank?

15:49.375 --> 15:52.208
Frank, I want you to meet
my cousin Russell Bufalino.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.750
You helped me with my truck
a few months ago.

15:55.833 --> 15:58.583
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
The timing chain.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.750
Did you get it fixed?

15:59.833 --> 16:01.083
I fixed it the next day.

16:01.583 --> 16:03.833
-Thanks again.
-You're welcome.

16:03.916 --> 16:05.166
I'm glad you fixed it.

16:11.375 --> 16:14.916
There's a lot of tough guys
around here. Did he tell ya?

16:15.833 --> 16:18.291
-You're not afraid of tough guys, are ya?
-No.

16:18.375 --> 16:20.666
I didn't think so. I'll see you around.

16:22.166 --> 16:23.916
Your cousin saved my ass.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.583
I could've lost the whole load.

16:25.666 --> 16:27.916
Yeah. Well, he knows
everything about trucks.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.041
He worked at Canada Dry for a long time.

16:30.125 --> 16:31.291
Vito, how are you?

16:31.375 --> 16:33.875
Let's take the booth. Come on.

16:34.625 --> 16:38.375
<i>I didn't know
who Russell Bufalino was back then,</i>

16:38.875 --> 16:41.750
<i>but I'd seen enough pictures and stories
in the newspapers</i>

16:41.833 --> 16:44.000
<i>to know he was eatin' with Angelo Bruno.</i>

16:44.083 --> 16:48.333
<i>Bruno, he... he was just made the new boss
of Philadelphia.</i>

16:48.416 --> 16:51.416
<i>He took care of everything
from Philadelphia to Atlantic City.</i>

16:51.500 --> 16:52.458
<i>That I knew.</i>

17:00.166 --> 17:02.083
<i>And that was all I had to know,</i>

17:02.166 --> 17:06.540
<i>to know that Russell Bufalino was no truck
mechanic from Canada Dry.</i>

17:11.500 --> 17:12.958
This bread is very good.

17:14.083 --> 17:15.040
Good, eh?

17:17.000 --> 17:20.958
Where did an Irisher like you
learn to speak Italian?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.165
In Italy - the war.

17:24.875 --> 17:25.750
Where?

17:26.750 --> 17:27.583
Salerno.

17:28.875 --> 17:29.750
Anzio.

17:31.083 --> 17:31.916
Sicily...

17:32.416 --> 17:33.708
around Catania.

17:33.791 --> 17:36.291
Catania? I'm from Catania.

17:36.791 --> 17:40.916
Yeah? I thought you had
an accent like Catania.

17:43.416 --> 17:45.791
How long were you in the war?

17:46.583 --> 17:47.666
Four years.

17:48.250 --> 17:51.291
411 days in combat...

17:51.916 --> 17:54.000
...122 at Anzio.

17:54.625 --> 17:56.041
Forty-fifth Infantry.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.291
Were you afraid of dying?

18:07.666 --> 18:09.000
Always afraid.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.583
And don't let anybody tell you

18:11.666 --> 18:14.833
that they weren't afraid.
That's a lot of bullshit.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.458
Everybody's afraid.

18:16.541 --> 18:17.541
And you pray a lot.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.375
I prayed a lot.

18:19.875 --> 18:23.875
I prayed I'd never sin again
if I could just get out of here.

18:25.583 --> 18:26.708
But then the fighting starts,

18:26.791 --> 18:29.250
and then you forget about everything.

18:29.333 --> 18:32.333
You're just trying to survive, stay alive.

18:33.750 --> 18:34.916
Once I saw

18:35.000 --> 18:36.625
that I was getting through the war,

18:36.708 --> 18:38.541
I looked around me, and I said:

18:39.125 --> 18:41.708
"From now on, whatever happens, happens."

18:44.875 --> 18:45.916
Fuck it.

18:47.541 --> 18:49.625
You know, you follow orders.

18:49.708 --> 18:52.791
They tell you to bring some
prisoners into... into the woods.

18:52.875 --> 18:55.125
They don't say what to do,

18:56.750 --> 18:58.916
they just say, "Hurry up."

19:02.708 --> 19:06.750
<i>It's crazy, but I never understood
how they would just keep digging...</i>

19:07.416 --> 19:08.416
<i>their own graves.</i>

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Stop!

19:15.125 --> 19:18.000
<i>Maybe they thought
if they did a good job,</i>

19:19.208 --> 19:20.458
<i>the guy with the gun...</i>

19:21.041 --> 19:22.708
<i>would change his mind.</i>

19:39.166 --> 19:42.250
<i>Russell, he... he took a shine to me
right away.</i>

19:43.500 --> 19:44.875
<i>After a while,</i>

19:45.500 --> 19:47.083
<i>he started giving me</i>

19:47.166 --> 19:48.416
<i>little things to do.</i>

19:49.166 --> 19:53.541
<i>But then Angelo, himself, started
giving me little things to do, too.</i>

19:57.583 --> 20:00.166
<i>Russ's wife Carrie, her family</i>

20:00.250 --> 20:02.166
<i>goes all the way back, way, way back</i>

20:02.250 --> 20:05.000
<i>to the same town in Sicily
as the Bufalinos.</i>

20:05.500 --> 20:07.208
<i>They talked about it all the time.</i>

20:07.875 --> 20:11.291
<i>She came from Mob royalty,
if you want to call it that.</i>

20:11.375 --> 20:12.625
<i>The Sciandras.</i>

20:13.208 --> 20:17.041
<i>To them, it was like they came over
on the... the Italian Mayflower.</i>

20:44.541 --> 20:47.000
Why don't you go upstairs, wash up.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.500
Give me those clothes.
I'll get rid of them.

20:54.083 --> 20:56.291
Don't forget your shoes, Russell.

21:05.166 --> 21:06.583
Hey, Frank,

21:07.166 --> 21:08.625
can we stop soon?

21:08.708 --> 21:12.166
Yeah, yeah, well,
ask your husband. Russell?

21:12.916 --> 21:14.458
He's out cold.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.625
-I got it, Frank.
-Sure?

21:33.333 --> 21:34.625
Where are we?

21:34.708 --> 21:35.833
Near Lewisburg.

21:36.958 --> 21:40.458
Let me know when we get there.
I got some stops to make.

21:52.750 --> 21:54.458
<i>Russell had a piece of everything.</i>

21:58.208 --> 22:01.958
<i>He had this store in Pittston called
Penn Drape and Curtains.</i>

22:02.041 --> 22:03.833
<i>And he ran everything out of there.</i>

22:04.791 --> 22:06.541
<i>Who knew what it all was?</i>

22:06.625 --> 22:09.875
<i>I'm sure the man had partners.
They always have partners.</i>

22:10.375 --> 22:12.125
<i>Nobody keeps all the money.</i>

22:13.291 --> 22:16.083
<i>But everybody listened to Russ.
That I can tell you.</i>

22:16.583 --> 22:19.791
<i>You wanted to bribe a judge,
you asked Russell.</i>

22:20.333 --> 22:24.041
<i>You didn't know how much to bribe him,
Russell was gonna tell you.</i>

22:24.666 --> 22:27.416
All right, I'll tell him.
I'll be right there.

22:28.250 --> 22:30.041
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

22:30.125 --> 22:32.166
<i>You want to promote one of your guys,</i>

22:32.833 --> 22:35.500
<i>Russ would tell you
you could or you could not.</i>

22:35.583 --> 22:36.750
Do me a favor.

22:36.833 --> 22:39.583
Go with Steve down to his place.
Take Vito with you.

22:39.666 --> 22:42.875
These guys keep coming around,
so straighten them out.

22:42.958 --> 22:44.500
I'll take care of it, Russ.

22:45.750 --> 22:47.541
Where's... Oh, here you are.

22:47.625 --> 22:51.500
<i>You want to make somebody disappear,
you got to get Russell's permission.</i>

22:52.083 --> 22:53.375
<i>No two ways about it.</i>

22:53.458 --> 22:56.125
-I wasn't worried.
-I didn't think so.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.541
-Tell your father I said "Hi".
-I'll tell him. Thanks.

22:59.041 --> 23:01.791
What are you doing here?
You gotta go with Bruno.

23:02.291 --> 23:03.416
I'm on my way.

23:03.500 --> 23:07.125
<i>And when you did something for Russ,
you did it yourself.</i>

23:07.208 --> 23:08.958
<i>Like Russ used to say...</i>

23:09.041 --> 23:11.666
<i>When I ask somebody to take care of
something for me,</i>

23:11.750 --> 23:13.875
I expect them to
take care of it themselves.

23:13.958 --> 23:16.250
I don't need two roads coming back to me.

24:20.583 --> 24:23.458
<i>When Anastasia got killed
in the barbershop,</i>

24:23.541 --> 24:26.625
<i>they brought Russell in
to calm things down,</i>

24:26.708 --> 24:28.833
<i>so that everybody wasn't going
around killing everybody</i>

24:28.916 --> 24:31.041
<i>and it could all get straightened out.</i>

24:32.625 --> 24:34.166
We know what happened.

24:34.250 --> 24:36.333
We can't change it. It is what it is.

24:36.416 --> 24:38.791
Please, tell my friend I'm happy to help.

24:39.291 --> 24:41.583
<i>You'd never know it
by looking at this guy,</i>

24:42.083 --> 24:44.875
<i>but all roads led back to Russ.</i>

24:52.708 --> 24:53.958
Where's the money?

24:54.041 --> 24:55.583
-He don't have it.
-He don't have it?

24:56.291 --> 24:59.583
-He said something about his mother--
-Don't tell me.

24:59.666 --> 25:00.500
Let me guess.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.541
His mother died,
and the funeral set him back.

25:04.208 --> 25:06.333
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

25:06.416 --> 25:07.375
Fucking mother's...

25:07.875 --> 25:09.958
fucking dying over and over
for ten years.

25:12.375 --> 25:13.333
What do I do?

25:13.416 --> 25:14.750
Don't leave.

25:27.416 --> 25:28.375
Here.

25:28.458 --> 25:30.416
Just show it to him. Don't use it.

25:48.583 --> 25:49.916
Hey. Look.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.041
Hey, Frank.

25:53.083 --> 25:54.791
Skinny wants to see you. Get in the car.

25:55.291 --> 25:57.625
-I was just gonna go see him.
-Get in the fucking car.

25:58.583 --> 26:01.000
-I was just gonna go see him!
-Get in the car!

26:01.083 --> 26:04.541
Don't get cute with me. That bullshit
about your mother. Get in the car!

26:04.625 --> 26:07.333
-I swear I was just gonna--
-Get in the fucking car!

26:12.166 --> 26:13.666
You want to get cute with me?

26:13.750 --> 26:17.416
All that bullshit about your mother
and sick and all that and dying.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.625
-I was just gonna go see him.
-You're gonna see him now.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.500
I swear,
I was gonna come see you tomorrow.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.458
Tomorrow. I swear to God.

26:23.541 --> 26:24.916
Tomorrow. Here.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.500
-What time?
-One o'clock. I'll be here at one.

26:27.583 --> 26:29.333
What, are you sleeping in?

26:29.916 --> 26:30.958
You tell me.

26:31.708 --> 26:33.208
Ten o'clock. Here.

26:33.291 --> 26:34.291
Tomorrow.

26:34.375 --> 26:35.750
Swear on your mother.

26:35.833 --> 26:37.083
Swear on your mother!

26:37.166 --> 26:38.000
Swear on your mother!

26:38.083 --> 26:39.916
I swear on my mother!

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
-What time tomorrow?
-I'll be here at ten o'clock.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.666
Tomorrow. Here.

26:44.750 --> 26:47.250
I'll bring the money tomorrow. All of it.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.416
I swear to God. How do I get home?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.166
Take the fucking bus!

26:58.041 --> 26:59.458
Let his mother pick him up.

27:10.291 --> 27:11.708
What's the matter with her?

27:12.208 --> 27:16.375
Nothing. She knocked something over
at the grocery store and made a mess,

27:16.458 --> 27:18.416
-and the grocer yelled at her.
-He yelled at her?

27:18.500 --> 27:19.875
He shoved her.

27:19.958 --> 27:21.000
He shoved her?

27:23.291 --> 27:24.666
Did he shove you?

27:25.875 --> 27:28.958
Who was this? The guy
at the grocery store on the corner? Joe?

27:32.708 --> 27:33.750
Did he?

27:34.500 --> 27:36.166
Honey, did he shove you?

27:37.833 --> 27:41.916
Just answer me. Did he push you?
Did he shove you? Did he do that?

27:42.708 --> 27:43.625
Let's go.

27:47.875 --> 27:50.458
Frank, he didn't mean it.
It just happened.

27:50.541 --> 27:52.875
He didn't mean it? He touched her.

27:52.958 --> 27:54.708
He has no right to push her. Touch her.

27:54.791 --> 27:56.500
Not even put one pinky on her.

28:03.416 --> 28:05.166
That's him, right?

28:05.250 --> 28:06.458
Stay here. Stay here.

28:10.125 --> 28:13.083
Frank, I'm sorry, but your kid
was out of line.

28:13.166 --> 28:14.625
I only did what you should.

28:20.208 --> 28:21.583
God, I'm sorry.

28:22.208 --> 28:23.916
No. Please. No, no, Frank.

28:33.458 --> 28:35.250
No, no, Frank! No!

28:38.666 --> 28:41.208
-Take that, you motherfucker!
-No! Come on!

28:44.041 --> 28:47.750
My fucking hand. My fucking hand!

29:24.125 --> 29:27.541
<i>Russell and Carrie baptized
our new daughter Dolores.</i>

29:28.125 --> 29:31.458
<i>It was a wonderful occasion,
and we were honored.</i>

29:32.166 --> 29:33.500
<i>Everybody showed up.</i>

29:55.916 --> 29:59.875
<i>The only thing is, you got more kids,
you gotta earn more money.</i>

30:02.708 --> 30:04.833
You wanna make a quick ten grand?

30:05.375 --> 30:07.166
<i>Whispers DiTullio. Not the Whispers</i>

30:07.250 --> 30:09.541
<i>they blew up in that car
around the same time.</i>

30:11.625 --> 30:14.500
<i>This was the good Whispers
who knew how to make money.</i>

30:15.583 --> 30:19.333
I got this place I front money to.
It's a really good business.

30:19.416 --> 30:20.541
It's a laundry.

30:20.625 --> 30:22.958
They collect the linen, towels,

30:23.041 --> 30:25.833
<i>sheets from the hotels and restaurants</i>

30:25.916 --> 30:28.458
<i>in Atlantic City. They wash and iron it.</i>

30:28.541 --> 30:31.666
Normally, it's like a license to print
fucking money.

30:32.166 --> 30:33.625
Until recently.

30:33.708 --> 30:38.500
A company that opened in Delaware
is trying to put us out of business.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.583
<i>They're cutting their prices.
They're scaring our drivers.</i>

30:42.666 --> 30:45.166
<i>They're trying to take our customers
from us.</i>

30:45.875 --> 30:48.375
To tell you the truth,
I'm a little concerned.

30:48.875 --> 30:53.208
<i>Whenever anybody says they're a little
concerned, they're very concerned.</i>

30:53.291 --> 30:57.333
As a matter of fact,
I'm really more than a little concerned.

30:57.416 --> 31:02.083
<i>And when they say they're more than
a little concerned, they're desperate.</i>

31:02.166 --> 31:06.416
I want this fucking place bombed, burnt,
torched, whatever you have to do.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.291
You were in the war. You know what to do.

31:09.083 --> 31:11.333
Leave that fucking place
like you left Berlin.

31:11.416 --> 31:15.000
Burnt to the fucking ground. I want them
out of fucking business.

31:15.625 --> 31:17.000
Who... who are they?

31:17.083 --> 31:20.250
It's the Cadillac Linen Service
in Delaware.

31:20.750 --> 31:22.541
It's run by a bunch of Jews.

31:23.125 --> 31:25.000
Let them collect their insurance,

31:25.083 --> 31:26.208
I'm sure they have plenty,

31:26.291 --> 31:28.458
and leave this fucking other place alone,

31:28.541 --> 31:30.083
the one I'm involved in.

31:31.583 --> 31:33.583
-This ain't ten grand.
-It's two grand.

31:33.666 --> 31:38.500
When you put these Jew washerwomen
out of business, you get the rest.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.458
I'm a little short of the money
right now,

31:42.041 --> 31:45.541
and I don't want to go to Skinny
and have to pay a big vig.

31:45.625 --> 31:48.625
I'm getting the money somewhere else.

31:50.166 --> 31:51.583
Nobody has to know.

31:51.666 --> 31:54.708
Especially not Skinny because
I'm not getting the money from him.

31:56.583 --> 32:00.458
I see you look a little hesitant.
I know what you can do.

32:00.541 --> 32:04.625
If I stiff you on the money,
you'll do something terrible to me.

32:04.708 --> 32:06.916
I do not want that.

32:18.541 --> 32:19.666
I hit the number.

32:20.166 --> 32:21.541
It's about 1,500.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.583
I'll see you in a few hours.

34:06.291 --> 34:07.416
Hey, Frank.

34:09.541 --> 34:11.125
Angelo wants to see you.

34:12.333 --> 34:14.250
-Now?
-Yeah, now is good.

34:15.125 --> 34:16.125
What's it about?

34:16.208 --> 34:18.916
I don't know. Come on. I'll drive you.

34:52.166 --> 34:53.250
Sit down, Frank.

35:05.875 --> 35:07.750
What're you doing in Delaware?

35:13.958 --> 35:16.208
Bombing out a laundry place.

35:22.416 --> 35:26.208
I was just doing a job to make some
extra money.

35:28.083 --> 35:30.166
Putting this place out of action.

35:31.208 --> 35:34.791
Putting this... Putting this place
out of commission.

35:36.583 --> 35:37.583
For who?

35:48.541 --> 35:50.750
Now is not the time to not say.

35:55.708 --> 35:56.666
Whispers.

35:57.166 --> 35:58.416
The other Whispers.

36:02.833 --> 36:05.208
You know who owns
the Cadillac Linen Service?

36:06.208 --> 36:10.416
-Some Jews in the laundry business.
-They own a part of it.

36:11.083 --> 36:13.666
You know who else has an interest in it?

36:13.750 --> 36:15.000
-No.
-I do.

36:15.916 --> 36:16.875
Who?

36:17.875 --> 36:20.166
I do. I own the other part.

36:20.250 --> 36:22.875
Not I know somebody who owns
the other part.

36:26.958 --> 36:29.750
Angelo, I didn't know
you had any part of it.

36:29.833 --> 36:33.291
I would never have done what I did
if I knew you were involved.

36:33.375 --> 36:35.375
I would never do that against you.

36:35.875 --> 36:37.875
Whispers didn't say it was the Jew Mob?

36:37.958 --> 36:39.458
He said Jew washerwomen.

36:42.666 --> 36:44.000
Jew washerwomen.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.000
What else he say?

36:47.541 --> 36:49.583
I bet he said keep it to yourself.

36:49.666 --> 36:51.875
Don't say nothing to nobody Downtown.

36:55.041 --> 36:56.000
He did.

37:01.750 --> 37:02.958
I didn't check.

37:03.458 --> 37:05.208
I'm sorry. I should've checked.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.250
-Can I give him his money back?
-He won't need it.

37:07.916 --> 37:09.208
You can keep it.

37:09.833 --> 37:13.083
I don't want no trouble. I'll just give it
back to him and I'm okay.

37:13.833 --> 37:15.083
He won't need it.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.083
Okay. Thanks.

37:21.166 --> 37:22.291
Thank Russell.

37:22.916 --> 37:25.291
I would have let the Jew Mob have you.

37:28.958 --> 37:30.583
You got a good friend here.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.750
You don't know how good
a friend you got.

37:33.875 --> 37:35.208
I... I know.

37:35.291 --> 37:36.416
No, you don't know.

37:39.875 --> 37:41.291
Wait by the bar.

37:58.083 --> 38:02.833
<i>In a case like this, the best thing to do
is you use something brand new.</i>

38:02.916 --> 38:04.416
<i>Right out of the box.</i>

38:04.500 --> 38:08.208
<i>Otherwise, you don't know where it's been
or who's used it.</i>

38:08.291 --> 38:10.583
<i>What crime it was connected to.</i>

38:10.666 --> 38:12.208
<i>That's suicide.</i>

38:12.291 --> 38:15.875
<i>So, I recommend something new,
straight out of the... the box.</i>

38:16.375 --> 38:18.083
<i>Stone cold. Clean.</i>

38:21.791 --> 38:26.000
There you are. I didn't know which way
you were coming from. I didn't--

38:33.375 --> 38:34.708
<i>The next thing you do</i>

38:34.791 --> 38:36.916
is throw the thing away. Get rid of it.

38:39.416 --> 38:42.041
<i>Everybody uses a spot in
the Schuylkill River.</i>

38:43.916 --> 38:47.500
<i>If they send divers down there,
they'd be able to arm a small country.</i>

39:12.000 --> 39:14.458
<i>For me, everything changed after Whispers.</i>

39:19.416 --> 39:20.333
<i>It was like the army.</i>

39:22.125 --> 39:23.041
<i>You followed orders.</i>

39:25.625 --> 39:27.041
<i>You did the right thing.</i>

39:27.583 --> 39:29.125
You got rewarded.

39:30.791 --> 39:35.125
<i>And when I handled things for Russell,
it was never for money,</i>

39:35.208 --> 39:37.041
<i>but as a show of respect.</i>

39:37.125 --> 39:38.416
<i>You ran an errand,</i>

39:38.500 --> 39:42.208
<i>you did a favor, you got a favor back
if you ever needed it.</i>

39:42.791 --> 39:45.125
<i>And you always hurried back.</i>

40:03.333 --> 40:04.666
Thank you, Vito.

40:07.583 --> 40:08.500
Hi, Frank.

40:09.041 --> 40:10.416
What can I get for you?

40:11.875 --> 40:13.625
I'm just gonna get the wine now.

40:15.958 --> 40:18.083
Just call me if you need anything.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.166
I will.

40:24.166 --> 40:26.416
-Help yourself, Frank.
-Thanks.

40:27.500 --> 40:28.666
Things change.

40:33.083 --> 40:35.375
-She's... she's the new one, right?
-Yeah.

40:35.958 --> 40:37.833
She's a nice kid. Nice kid.

40:48.666 --> 40:52.291
<i>No time is a... is a good time
to leave your wife,</i>

40:52.375 --> 40:54.708
<i>but that's when I left mine.</i>

41:03.791 --> 41:05.583
Hey, Ira, what's going on?

41:09.291 --> 41:11.583
-Any problems?
-No. Everything's good.

41:14.625 --> 41:16.250
Pull over after this Caddy.

41:22.875 --> 41:24.333
He's expecting you.

41:49.958 --> 41:52.166
Phil, you have a nice shop here.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.833
People like to come to this store.

41:54.916 --> 41:57.666
But your kid is a real <i>sfigato.</i>

41:57.750 --> 41:59.666
Understand? He's a pain in the ass.

42:00.250 --> 42:03.541
He's a wild kid. You gotta control him.
If you don't,

42:03.625 --> 42:06.291
nobody's gonna want to shop here anymore.

42:06.375 --> 42:09.250
If it's not good for you,
it's not good for me.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.958
You understand what I'm saying.

42:13.166 --> 42:14.791
I apologize, Russell.

42:16.250 --> 42:19.375
That's from you and Frank, and this one
from you and me.

42:19.458 --> 42:21.000
What about a baby spoon?

42:21.666 --> 42:24.458
-What'll she do with a baby spoon?
-Have a baby.

42:24.541 --> 42:25.958
They're not married yet.

42:26.041 --> 42:27.458
I give you my word.

42:27.541 --> 42:29.375
All right. Your word's good, Phil.

42:30.666 --> 42:32.375
Let's go, girls.

42:32.458 --> 42:34.166
We're done.

42:34.250 --> 42:35.541
What are you doing?

42:37.166 --> 42:38.791
When the hell are you gonna wise up?

42:52.708 --> 42:55.125
There we go. That's my girl.

43:07.458 --> 43:08.458
Hey, Peggy.

43:10.166 --> 43:11.375
Come here.

43:14.916 --> 43:16.083
I don't know.

43:17.541 --> 43:20.625
I get the feeling she don't like me.
Like she's afraid of me.

43:20.708 --> 43:22.166
That's the way she is.

43:22.250 --> 43:25.750
She's afraid of me at times, too.
She's a sensitive kid.

43:26.916 --> 43:30.458
I understand if she's afraid of me,
but she shouldn't be scared of you.

43:31.125 --> 43:34.291
And then she hears about me
in the papers sometimes.

43:34.791 --> 43:37.000
You gotta be close to your kids.

43:37.083 --> 43:37.916
I am.

43:38.500 --> 43:39.916
You're blessed to have them.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.166
Carrie and I can't have kids.

43:42.250 --> 43:44.458
But you're blessed. You're blessed.

43:44.541 --> 43:46.541
Call her. Tell her to come over.

43:46.625 --> 43:48.416
Sweetheart. Peggy. Come here.

43:55.125 --> 43:56.916
-Come here.
-Come over by Uncle Russ.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.916
-How are you?
-Okay.

44:00.708 --> 44:03.791
Do you know why God made the sky
so high?

44:06.500 --> 44:10.708
So little birdies don't bunk their head
on it when they're flying around.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.583
Isn't that cute?

44:13.666 --> 44:14.833
A little joke.

44:15.333 --> 44:16.333
Isn't that funny?

44:16.958 --> 44:18.083
You want some candy?

44:19.500 --> 44:21.583
No, you guys don't want any candy.

44:23.291 --> 44:25.416
There's nothing I can do for you?

44:26.875 --> 44:28.916
If there is, let Uncle Russell know.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Okay.

44:30.083 --> 44:31.541
Go back. Have some fun.

44:34.333 --> 44:35.500
You see what I mean?

44:36.083 --> 44:37.416
See that feeling I get?

44:37.500 --> 44:41.000
She's just shy.
She... she don't mean nothing.

44:41.708 --> 44:45.833
Sometimes, when the parents get divorced,
the kids get all confused,

44:45.916 --> 44:48.875
and they get resentful, and they don't
know who to take it out on

44:48.958 --> 44:50.333
or which side, or...

44:50.416 --> 44:51.458
No, you're right.

44:51.541 --> 44:56.750
I'm lucky because Reenie and
Mary get along like gangbusters,

44:56.833 --> 44:59.500
so the kids go back and forth
with no problem.

44:59.583 --> 45:03.250
Keep your family close.
Keep an eye on that.

45:03.333 --> 45:05.500
I mean, I'm... I'm just lucky.

45:10.375 --> 45:11.958
How's it going with the union?

45:12.458 --> 45:15.208
-The union's the best in the world.
-You like it, huh?

45:15.875 --> 45:18.500
I wish I had something more steady, but...

45:20.333 --> 45:21.833
How about organizing?

45:22.666 --> 45:24.375
I would like to do that. But...

45:24.458 --> 45:25.708
there's a long line.

45:26.208 --> 45:28.291
A long waiting list, if you will.

45:29.500 --> 45:32.791
Well, a friend of ours
is having a little trouble.

45:32.875 --> 45:34.416
Friend at the top.

45:34.500 --> 45:36.125
Who's that?

45:36.208 --> 45:37.041
The top.

45:37.625 --> 45:38.458
Hoffa?

45:39.041 --> 45:39.875
Yeah.

45:40.375 --> 45:44.833
I heard the other day that some guys
tried to pipe him because of

45:44.916 --> 45:46.041
a workman's comp case.

45:46.125 --> 45:49.250
Yeah, I heard he
beat the shit out of them.

45:49.333 --> 45:51.125
How long can he keep doing that?

45:51.208 --> 45:54.500
He needs somebody he can trust around him.

45:54.583 --> 45:57.333
Somebody to be with him all the time.

46:01.458 --> 46:02.750
<i>I'll put McGee on the phone.</i>

46:05.000 --> 46:05.958
Hello.

46:06.958 --> 46:08.666
Hiya, my friend. How are you?

46:10.291 --> 46:13.041
I got that kid
I was talking to you about here.

46:13.125 --> 46:15.708
I'm gonna put him on the phone,
let you talk to him.

46:19.250 --> 46:20.500
Hello.

46:20.583 --> 46:21.500
Is that Frank?

46:22.166 --> 46:24.250
Hiya, Frank. This is Jimmy Hoffa.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.208
-Glad to meet you.
<i>-Glad to meet you, too,</i>

46:27.291 --> 46:29.000
even if it's over the phone.

46:30.791 --> 46:32.250
I heard you paint houses.

46:33.250 --> 46:35.791
Yes. Yes, sir, I... I do. I do.

46:35.875 --> 46:37.083
And I...

46:37.166 --> 46:39.000
I also do my own carpentry.

46:39.583 --> 46:40.916
<i>Glad to hear that.</i>

46:41.666 --> 46:43.375
I hear you're a brother of mine.

46:43.458 --> 46:46.625
Yes, sir. Local 107. Since 1947.

46:48.541 --> 46:50.375
Our friend speaks very highly of you.

46:51.666 --> 46:52.625
Thank you.

46:52.708 --> 46:54.708
He's not an easy man to please.

46:55.208 --> 46:56.333
I do my best.

46:56.416 --> 46:57.958
<i>Well, there's a situation...</i>

46:58.041 --> 47:00.875
<i>Nowadays, young people,
they don't know</i>

47:00.958 --> 47:02.166
<i>who Jimmy Hoffa was.</i>

47:02.250 --> 47:03.666
<i>They don't have a clue.</i>

47:04.166 --> 47:08.791
<i>Maybe they know that he disappeared
or something, but that's about it.</i>

47:08.875 --> 47:10.791
<i>But back then, there wasn't nobody</i>

47:10.875 --> 47:14.458
<i>in this country who didn't know
who Jimmy Hoffa was.</i>

47:14.541 --> 47:17.666
God bless, Jimmy. You're a real gentleman.

47:19.041 --> 47:22.458
<i>In the '50s, he was as big as Elvis.</i>

47:22.541 --> 47:24.791
<i>In the '60s, he was like the Beatles.</i>

47:25.416 --> 47:29.333
<i>Next to the President, he was the most
powerful man in the country. Bar none.</i>

47:29.416 --> 47:30.708
If you got it,

47:31.208 --> 47:33.458
a truck brought it to you.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
If you got

47:36.083 --> 47:38.125
your food, your clothing,

47:38.208 --> 47:41.458
your medicine, fuel for your homes,

47:41.541 --> 47:43.458
fuel for your industries,

47:44.083 --> 47:46.041
a truck brought it to them.

47:48.208 --> 47:51.250
The day our trucks stop,

47:51.333 --> 47:53.125
America stops!

47:55.750 --> 48:00.083
<i>There's a situation going on now, Frank,
that needs to be attended to.</i>

48:00.166 --> 48:04.583
Big business and the government
are trying to tear the union apart.

48:04.666 --> 48:06.250
<i>They're trying to pull us down.</i>

48:06.333 --> 48:08.333
<i>Big business is on the attack!</i>

48:08.916 --> 48:12.041
They're coming. They're coming hard
and they're coming fast.

48:12.125 --> 48:14.125
Big business and the government

48:14.208 --> 48:16.458
are trying to sow the seeds of dissent

48:16.541 --> 48:18.250
among our ranks,

48:18.333 --> 48:21.583
at a time when we need unity!

48:21.666 --> 48:24.000
We need solidarity!

48:24.583 --> 48:26.458
I want to write it in the sky.

48:27.041 --> 48:28.666
Solidarity!

48:29.958 --> 48:31.166
Solidarity!

48:32.625 --> 48:34.125
Solidarity!

48:34.208 --> 48:36.375
<i>You wanna be a part of this fight?</i>

48:36.458 --> 48:37.666
Yes, I do, sir.

48:37.750 --> 48:40.291
<i>Would you like to be
a part of this history?</i>

48:40.375 --> 48:41.583
Yes, I would.

48:42.375 --> 48:45.000
Whatever you need me to do, I'm available.

48:45.083 --> 48:47.166
Can you come to Chicago tomorrow?

48:47.250 --> 48:49.166
-I can, sir.
<i>-See you then.</i>

48:54.166 --> 48:55.833
He likes to talk, don't he?

49:01.250 --> 49:03.458
Thought I was talking to General Patton.

49:08.083 --> 49:10.750
<i>You know, Frank, the only reason why
you're here,</i>

49:11.500 --> 49:16.166
<i>the Seafarers Union is signing up
the same non-union cab drivers</i>

49:16.250 --> 49:17.791
<i>as we want to do.</i>

49:17.875 --> 49:20.041
Nobody knows who you are,

49:20.125 --> 49:23.333
and nobody knows what the fuck
you're doing here. Okay?

49:23.416 --> 49:25.125
You and I know why you're here.

49:25.208 --> 49:29.750
We need to sign these drivers up
so Paul Hall doesn't get 'em

49:29.833 --> 49:31.208
for his fucking union.

49:31.291 --> 49:35.541
For some reason, most of these drivers
are fucking lesbians.

49:35.625 --> 49:37.208
I have no reason why.

49:37.708 --> 49:39.958
Paul Hall's running around saying that

49:40.041 --> 49:43.291
he's getting a better contract
than our boy Jimmy.

49:43.375 --> 49:44.875
He's a cocksucker.

49:45.625 --> 49:49.625
Jimmy has Mayor fucking Daley
in his pocket.

49:49.708 --> 49:52.166
The cops are okay with whatever we do.

49:52.250 --> 49:54.500
They won't help us push these cars in,

49:54.583 --> 49:57.583
but they won't let anybody
fucking stop us.

50:18.916 --> 50:20.541
Come on, all you guys.

50:20.625 --> 50:23.333
Let's get this fucking thing
in there. Watch yourself!

50:26.291 --> 50:27.833
This is a lot of work.

50:27.916 --> 50:30.000
-You ever think of using candy?
-What?

50:30.083 --> 50:31.083
Candy.

50:31.166 --> 50:32.708
What the fuck is candy?

50:37.958 --> 50:40.958
-Hey, Lou, open the fucking gate.
-I got it. I got it.

50:41.666 --> 50:43.833
Here, you take the gas.

51:00.666 --> 51:02.333
One thing about Jimmy.

51:02.416 --> 51:04.250
Don't ever make him wait.

51:04.333 --> 51:08.208
If you have a meeting, get there
on time. Better, get there early.

51:08.291 --> 51:09.833
I can't stress this enough.

51:09.916 --> 51:13.208
His problem is that time is of essence.

51:13.291 --> 51:14.708
That's the important thing.

51:15.208 --> 51:17.541
One more thing. Jimmy doesn't drink.

51:18.416 --> 51:21.500
The head of the largest fucking union
in the world don't drink.

51:21.583 --> 51:25.166
The worst part about it is, he doesn't
allow anybody to drink around him.

51:30.833 --> 51:31.833
Another thing about him.

51:31.916 --> 51:34.458
Jimmy hates fucking watermelon.

51:37.541 --> 51:39.083
But we're gonna like watermelon.

51:40.416 --> 51:41.791
Jimmy, you should'a seen it,

51:41.875 --> 51:43.166
sinking in the water.

51:44.333 --> 51:46.708
One by one. I bet you
when they woke up

51:46.791 --> 51:49.458
the next morning,
those fucking cab drivers

51:49.541 --> 51:52.791
went to get their cabs,
they didn't know what the fuck hit 'em.

51:53.541 --> 51:54.958
Great idea, Joey.

51:55.041 --> 51:56.291
Great idea.

51:56.375 --> 51:57.875
Well, it wasn't my idea.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.416
My man Frank. It was his idea.

52:01.500 --> 52:03.041
Let me tell you something.

52:03.125 --> 52:05.916
Frank took over the pier.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.291
Whatever he told them to do,
whatever he said, they did it.

52:10.625 --> 52:14.083
I never seen a guy walk through a crowd
like he does.

52:14.166 --> 52:16.791
He doesn't touch a fucking person!
Everybody gets out of the way.

52:16.875 --> 52:18.666
I'm not kidding you. I swear.

52:18.750 --> 52:21.083
Guys he never met in his life.
It was like...

52:21.166 --> 52:23.041
like Moses. Remember Moses,

52:23.125 --> 52:27.250
when he walked into the ocean, the sea,
whatever it was, and it opened up!

52:27.333 --> 52:30.458
That's him. I'm telling you.
Jimmy, he's got it.

52:30.541 --> 52:31.666
What do you think?

52:31.750 --> 52:34.083
You need him a few days more?

52:34.166 --> 52:36.625
We gotta clear up a few dribs and drabs.

52:38.875 --> 52:40.583
You guys sure like watermelon.

52:41.166 --> 52:42.166
Want a bite?

52:42.250 --> 52:43.291
Not on your life.

52:45.458 --> 52:47.750
You were there. You saw it firsthand.

52:47.833 --> 52:49.708
Those guys ain't union.

52:49.791 --> 52:53.791
They're like Nazi collaborators,
operating behind the lines.

52:53.875 --> 52:55.833
-You know. You were in the war.
-I sure do.

52:56.916 --> 52:57.791
In a war,

52:57.875 --> 53:01.791
you go from point A to point B.

53:02.708 --> 53:03.958
Sometimes...

53:04.458 --> 53:07.250
you spill a little beer along the way.

53:09.333 --> 53:11.000
That philosophy make sense to you?

53:11.083 --> 53:12.208
Sure does.

53:13.208 --> 53:14.250
Good.

53:31.208 --> 53:34.708
<i>Jimmy didn't make me stay in his suite
because he liked me.</i>

53:35.375 --> 53:39.750
<i>He didn't want me
registering in my name at the hotel.</i>

53:41.083 --> 53:44.083
<i>This way, there was no proof
I was even in Chicago.</i>

53:53.750 --> 53:56.041
Come on, Jimmy, you're way behind.

53:56.125 --> 53:57.125
Nothing stops her.

53:57.708 --> 54:01.500
<i>After Chicago, Jimmy and I got close.
The wives hit it off.</i>

54:02.166 --> 54:05.750
<i>And with Jimmy and Josephine's kids
grown up and out of the house,</i>

54:05.833 --> 54:07.708
<i>they got a kick out of our kids, too.</i>

54:10.916 --> 54:12.250
<i>Especially Peggy.</i>

54:12.333 --> 54:15.250
<i>She and Jimmy
fell for each other right away.</i>

54:15.833 --> 54:19.625
You know what I like even better than
getting my picture took?

54:19.708 --> 54:20.625
What?

54:23.041 --> 54:24.625
Surprise!

54:25.791 --> 54:29.791
<i>To Peggy, Jimmy wasn't like Russ,
or Skinny or even me.</i>

54:29.875 --> 54:33.083
Sorry, everybody.
This is just for Peggy and I.

54:33.166 --> 54:35.208
<i>For one thing,
Jimmy didn't have a nickname</i>

54:35.291 --> 54:37.625
<i>like the "Razor" or "The Hunchback"</i>

54:37.708 --> 54:39.833
<i>or "The Weasel", or "Whispers".</i>

54:39.916 --> 54:41.750
So, what happened to "Thank you"?

54:43.750 --> 54:46.166
<i>And to her, he was helping people.</i>

54:46.250 --> 54:49.041
<i>He was helping them make more money,
live better lives.</i>

54:49.625 --> 54:52.041
<i>He wasn't stomping on somebody's hand.</i>

54:53.791 --> 54:56.000
"'If you have it,
a truck brought it to you."

54:56.083 --> 54:57.583
This is what Mr. Hoffa says.

54:58.166 --> 55:02.250
He's the president of the Teamsters Union
with over a million members.

55:02.333 --> 55:05.208
They all support him
because they have steady jobs

55:05.291 --> 55:07.958
big pay and a retirement pension.

55:09.333 --> 55:13.041
<i>The Teamster Pension Fund
had eight billion dollars in it.</i>

55:13.125 --> 55:16.750
<i>Jimmy had complete control
over every bit of it.</i>

55:17.333 --> 55:19.416
Isn't this a beautiful presentation?

55:19.500 --> 55:22.083
A bridge loan is really
all I'm asking, Jimmy.

55:22.625 --> 55:26.625
I'm not gonna piss away my members'
pension dough on something too risky.

55:26.708 --> 55:28.541
This is not a risk, Jimmy.

55:28.625 --> 55:30.875
I got Minsky's Follies.

55:30.958 --> 55:33.458
I got the first topless act on the Strip.

55:33.541 --> 55:36.000
We're booming in there.
I can't get the drinks out...

55:36.083 --> 55:39.125
Just asking for a golf course. You know
you never lost a dime with me.

55:39.208 --> 55:42.833
We'd really appreciate whatever
you can do to help Jake along here.

55:42.916 --> 55:45.458
One-five is all I need
for a completion bond.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.458
Okay. Okay. Go to the bank.

55:51.916 --> 55:54.166
It's gonna be a big success.
Thank you, Jimmy.

55:54.250 --> 55:56.041
You're a prince. You're a <i>mensch.</i>

56:05.375 --> 56:09.541
And, because of Mr. Hoffa,
workers have medical insurance

56:09.625 --> 56:10.791
for when they get sick,

56:10.875 --> 56:14.333
and know, when they retire,
they're not going to go hungry.

56:16.208 --> 56:20.583
<i>There was so much paperwork that Jimmy
used an insurance company</i>

56:20.666 --> 56:23.791
<i>run by this kid, Allen Dorfman,
to work out the loans.</i>

56:23.875 --> 56:27.625
No, no, nothing for nothing.
Next time ask a little bit fucking nicer.

56:32.458 --> 56:34.791
And? And? How'd it go?

56:34.875 --> 56:39.041
It was a little touch and go for a bit.
But at the end, fine.

56:39.125 --> 56:42.208
<i>Russ would get Jimmy to give
guys like Gottlieb the loans</i>

56:42.291 --> 56:44.958
<i>and you would get like 10% of that.</i>

56:45.541 --> 56:47.541
<i>Or whatever. Maybe even more.</i>

56:47.625 --> 56:50.958
You tell Marteduzzo from me
that I appreciate it.

56:51.041 --> 56:53.458
Everybody'll appreciate it.
It's a good thing.

56:54.625 --> 56:58.458
<i>You couldn't go to regular banks because
the money was for gambling.</i>

56:58.541 --> 57:00.000
<i>God's truth, that's what it was.</i>

57:00.083 --> 57:04.750
<i>You couldn't. So the Mob went to
the Teamsters for the money.</i>

57:04.833 --> 57:06.583
<i>It was the Teamsters that stepped in</i>

57:06.666 --> 57:08.791
<i>and lent the money that built Las Vegas.</i>

57:09.875 --> 57:13.250
Billy, don't touch this stuff.
Just go where you gotta go.

57:13.333 --> 57:16.458
<i>There was more business than anybody
could handle.</i>

57:16.541 --> 57:20.083
<i>So Jimmy had to shove some of the deals
off on to his wife Jo,</i>

57:20.166 --> 57:24.958
<i>who had no idea she had 22% of
a Florida land deal called "Sun Valley,"</i>

57:25.041 --> 57:29.000
<i>some charter fishing boats,
and a ski lodge with its own mountain.</i>

57:34.541 --> 57:37.708
<i>One of Jimmy's clients
was Sam "Momo" Giancana,</i>

57:37.791 --> 57:40.291
<i>who was friends with the Kennedys
from back when Jack's father</i>

57:40.375 --> 57:42.166
<i>made his fortune with the Italians</i>

57:42.250 --> 57:44.333
<i>as a bootlegger during Prohibition.</i>

57:44.416 --> 57:46.750
<i>Momo, Sinatra hung out together</i>

57:46.833 --> 57:48.250
<i>with the Kennedys.</i>

57:49.583 --> 57:53.750
Momo and Kennedy, believe it or not,
even had the same girlfriend.

57:53.833 --> 57:55.791
Together. At the same time.

57:56.333 --> 57:57.416
Talk about crazy.

57:58.333 --> 58:02.375
<i>It was easy for the Mob to help
Joe Kennedy get his son elected president.</i>

58:03.708 --> 58:06.708
<i>They just punched up the vote to make
sure that he won</i>

58:06.791 --> 58:08.041
<i>in Illinois.</i>

58:11.625 --> 58:13.250
<i>In exchange for that,</i>

58:13.333 --> 58:16.666
the new president was gonna get
Castro out of Cuba,

58:16.750 --> 58:21.458
so our guys could get their casinos
and race tracks and shrimp boats

58:21.541 --> 58:25.458
and everything else that they had
and owned down there in Havana back.

58:25.541 --> 58:27.250
But that that didn't happen.

58:34.541 --> 58:35.375
<i>The Italians</i>

58:35.458 --> 58:38.791
<i>wanted Kennedy the Irishman
for President,</i>

58:38.875 --> 58:40.416
<i>and that's what they got.</i>

58:42.500 --> 58:45.416
Get used to it because we're gonna be
seeing it 24/7.

58:45.500 --> 58:46.875
Son of a bitch!

58:46.958 --> 58:49.791
Goddamn Kennedys.
I'm looking at the damn Kennedys.

58:49.875 --> 58:51.541
The kids. Language.

58:51.625 --> 58:53.500
What difference does it make?

58:53.583 --> 58:56.958
They gotta learn sooner or later.
We're going to war with these people.

58:57.541 --> 58:58.416
War!

58:59.125 --> 59:00.958
I've said it a thousand times.

59:01.041 --> 59:02.875
I don't care they're Irish.

59:03.500 --> 59:05.083
I don't care they're Catholic.

59:05.166 --> 59:08.500
If there's one person you can't trust
in this life,

59:08.583 --> 59:10.041
it's millionaires' kids.

59:10.125 --> 59:11.291
You're right, Jimmy.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.625
Especially that little son of a bitch.

59:16.791 --> 59:20.500
You don't remember doing any favors
for Johnny Dio

59:20.583 --> 59:22.333
or you don't remember
the conversation?

59:23.708 --> 59:27.416
I'm saying,
to the best of my recollection,

59:27.500 --> 59:30.041
I must recall on my memory,

59:30.125 --> 59:31.791
I cannot remember.

59:34.250 --> 59:36.541
Then where did this $20,000 come from?

59:38.833 --> 59:40.083
Individuals.

59:41.250 --> 59:43.083
Which individuals, Mr. Hoffa?

59:45.333 --> 59:49.875
Off hand, that particular amount of money
I borrowed...

59:50.375 --> 59:52.791
I don't know at this particular moment.

59:53.708 --> 59:58.166
But the record of my loans,
which I requested, I have...

59:58.791 --> 01:00:01.041
and out of all the moneys I loaned

01:00:01.125 --> 01:00:04.833
during this period of time
I went into these ventures.

01:00:10.916 --> 01:00:12.375
<i>Those goddamn Kennedys,</i>

01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:13.875
they get what they want!

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:15.041
Jimmy, the kids.

01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:18.708
Him and all the bullshit problems
he put me through already.

01:00:18.791 --> 01:00:20.916
I gotta go. You don't expect me
to look at this.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.375
No, I don't.

01:00:23.458 --> 01:00:24.791
<i>For guys like Russ,</i>

01:00:24.875 --> 01:00:26.291
<i>it couldn't have been better.</i>

01:00:26.375 --> 01:00:30.958
<i>Russ did his part for getting
Kennedy elected,</i>

01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:32.000
<i>that's for sure.</i>

01:00:32.083 --> 01:00:33.500
What are you doing?

01:00:33.583 --> 01:00:35.958
I told you to put them on every pole.

01:00:36.041 --> 01:00:37.250
<i>So, what's the first thing</i>

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:40.250
<i>that Jack Kennedy does to thank
Chicago for all their help?</i>

01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:43.500
He puts his shitass brother in there,

01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:47.333
<i>that little prep school punk,
and he makes him Attorney General.</i>

01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:54.083
And what's the first thing Bobby does?
He goes after not just Jimmy,

01:00:54.166 --> 01:00:56.833
which in a way you could understand.

01:00:56.916 --> 01:00:58.500
Jimmy hated the Kennedys so much,

01:00:58.583 --> 01:01:01.500
he gave Nixon $500,000 in Teamster cash.

01:01:01.583 --> 01:01:06.458
But Bobby also goes after Giancana,
Marcello, Trafficante,

01:01:06.541 --> 01:01:07.750
and all the other guys

01:01:07.833 --> 01:01:10.708
who put his brother in the White House
in the first place.

01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:14.125
What's that about?

01:01:15.375 --> 01:01:16.458
Thank you.

01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:18.500
Am I missing something?

01:01:24.375 --> 01:01:25.458
That's gorgeous.

01:01:27.875 --> 01:01:30.000
Wear it in the best of health.
We love you.

01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:33.083
This one is for Peggy,

01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:36.166
from Uncle Russell.
Merry Christmas, my love.

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:38.458
Oh, look at those.

01:01:40.416 --> 01:01:42.041
So nice!

01:01:42.125 --> 01:01:43.833
I heard you like to skate.

01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:46.666
What do you say?

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:49.583
Thank you.

01:01:50.125 --> 01:01:52.041
Now me and Uncle Russell can take
you ice skating.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:55.583
I think Santa Claus left you a little
something extra in there, too.

01:02:00.833 --> 01:02:02.875
What do you say to Uncle Russell?

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.666
What do you say?

01:02:08.916 --> 01:02:09.916
It's all right.

01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:13.083
She said thank you once. That's enough.

01:02:16.125 --> 01:02:19.541
<i>With Bobby as Attorney General,
they were all over us.</i>

01:02:19.625 --> 01:02:23.125
<i>We couldn't talk on the phone because
we knew it was being bugged.</i>

01:02:23.208 --> 01:02:24.916
<i>You couldn't do nothing.
You couldn't go nowhere.</i>

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.083
<i>You couldn't do anything. It was a bad,</i>

01:02:27.166 --> 01:02:29.166
<i>bad, bad situation. And then...</i>

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:30.791
<i>Jimmy... Forget it.</i>

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:35.583
<i>Bobby, as Attorney General, has
the power to send anybody to jail.</i>

01:02:35.666 --> 01:02:38.166
<i>And Jimmy was at the top
of Bobby's hit list.</i>

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:39.375
<i>He even set up</i>

01:02:39.458 --> 01:02:41.000
<i>a "Get Hoffa Squad".</i>

01:02:41.083 --> 01:02:44.666
<i>And he had his guys from the FBI,
the IRS working 'round the clock.</i>

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:47.916
<i>Their only job
was to put Jimmy Hoffa in jail.</i>

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.083
<i>That's all they did.</i>

01:02:52.041 --> 01:02:56.041
I am sitting in a room
full of fuckin' idiots.

01:02:57.708 --> 01:03:00.125
You dumb motherfuckers!

01:03:00.208 --> 01:03:01.875
You know what you did?

01:03:01.958 --> 01:03:04.375
You take Johnny O'Rourke's kid...

01:03:05.041 --> 01:03:06.625
and you put him on

01:03:06.708 --> 01:03:08.833
as general organizer,

01:03:09.666 --> 01:03:12.375
pay him thirty-six fucking grand,

01:03:12.958 --> 01:03:14.666
at the same time...

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:19.541
you let him sell insurance
to his fucking father's...

01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:30.333
to his fucking father's...

01:03:31.666 --> 01:03:34.666
to his fucking father's locals!

01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:36.333
Damn it!

01:03:37.708 --> 01:03:38.958
How do you do that?

01:03:40.875 --> 01:03:43.041
How stupid can you be?

01:03:45.375 --> 01:03:47.875
That fucking cocksucker Kennedy

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:51.083
has got his nose up my ass
everywhere I go!

01:03:51.625 --> 01:03:55.000
They're hounding me.
They're looking at everything I do.

01:03:55.083 --> 01:03:57.791
And you let this happen in public!

01:03:58.375 --> 01:03:59.750
You're giving it to him!

01:03:59.833 --> 01:04:02.000
I'm going to jail. You understand?

01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:04.958
I'm going to prison because of you,

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:07.208
you dumb motherfuckers.

01:04:07.291 --> 01:04:08.833
What you wanted

01:04:08.916 --> 01:04:11.208
was to put me in jail.
Tell me, so I can kill you.

01:04:11.291 --> 01:04:12.750
Right here!

01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:21.916
-Where're you going?
-I fucking quit, that's where I'm going.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.083
Quitting? Why?

01:04:23.166 --> 01:04:25.333
You gonna call me a motherfucker?

01:04:25.416 --> 01:04:27.333
You can talk to them like that,
but not to me.

01:04:27.416 --> 01:04:29.500
No! That didn't apply to you.

01:04:29.583 --> 01:04:33.291
Then let me know it didn't apply to me.
I'm standing right there.

01:04:33.375 --> 01:04:35.041
I didn't even see you standing there!

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:37.583
I was standing right there.
What are you talking about?

01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:40.416
But it didn't apply to you!
What else can I say?

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.375
You got a problem, pull me aside.

01:04:44.458 --> 01:04:46.708
Don't insult me and then say
it didn't apply to me.

01:04:46.791 --> 01:04:48.958
But I didn't even see you there.

01:04:49.541 --> 01:04:53.833
Come on, Frank, you know me better
than that. You know me better than that.

01:04:53.916 --> 01:04:54.750
Please.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:58.833
Come on. It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:01.125
Why would I say that to you?

01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:05.500
-You gotta control these people.
-I'm controlling everything. Don't worry.

01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:09.916
Okay, guys, get out of here now.

01:05:10.416 --> 01:05:13.625
<i>I don't know how
Jimmy is running the fucking union.</i>

01:05:13.708 --> 01:05:18.041
Between Bobby and the FBI up his ass
all the time, he's going fucking crazy.

01:05:18.541 --> 01:05:21.166
Tell Jimmy I'm sorry for his troubles.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:25.958
The old-timers know the old man.
They'll talk to him and straighten it out.

01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:29.541
But he can't understand,
and to be honest, I don't either,

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:33.000
how youse could help get the Kennedy
pricks elected in the first place.

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:34.875
It don't make no sense to him.

01:05:34.958 --> 01:05:36.458
He doesn't have to understand everything.

01:05:37.083 --> 01:05:39.500
You know what I'm saying.
Sometimes it's better.

01:05:40.833 --> 01:05:43.166
When I see him like that, you know...

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:46.875
I'm tryin' to... I feel bad.
I wanna help him in some way.

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:49.083
He's too emotional.

01:05:49.166 --> 01:05:53.666
Like some guy who's rushing all over
the place and misses the big picture.

01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:56.250
Like Cuba.

01:05:58.083 --> 01:06:01.083
Getting us back into casinos.

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:03.416
Getting us back into Havana.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:06.583
Like getting rid
of that fucking Castro prick.

01:06:09.916 --> 01:06:12.458
The old-timers spoke to the old man.

01:06:12.541 --> 01:06:15.416
The old man talked to his son Jack,
and he told him...

01:06:15.916 --> 01:06:18.500
don't forget who the fuck he owes.

01:06:20.458 --> 01:06:23.250
He knows who the fuck he owes.

01:06:24.541 --> 01:06:26.166
<i>So, I want you...</i>

01:06:26.666 --> 01:06:30.083
<i>to go down to a place
called Milestone Hauling.</i>

01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:33.375
<i>There's a guy named Phil.</i>

01:06:33.875 --> 01:06:35.708
<i>He's gonna give you a rig.</i>

01:06:42.833 --> 01:06:47.166
<i>You drive the rig to Baltimore
to a concrete plant.</i>

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:48.791
<i>It's on Eastern Avenue.</i>

01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:51.375
<i>It's the only one on the street.
You can't miss it.</i>

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:57.458
<i>A guy's gonna meet you there.</i>

01:06:58.041 --> 01:06:59.750
<i>A fairy named Ferrie.</i>

01:07:00.958 --> 01:07:03.166
Pull it forward, then back it in.

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:26.375
<i>You'll pick up some things.</i>

01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:29.916
<i>He'll give you some paperwork
in case you get stopped.</i>

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:43.375
<i>You drive down to Florida.</i>

01:07:43.458 --> 01:07:45.500
<i>A dog track outside Jacksonville.</i>

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.625
<i>You leave it there.</i>

01:07:49.583 --> 01:07:53.208
<i>A guy with big ears named Hunt
will meet you there.</i>

01:07:54.875 --> 01:07:58.000
<i>He's gonna give you a car
to drive back to Philly.</i>

01:08:11.625 --> 01:08:13.166
What are you looking at?

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:14.416
You looking at my ears?

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.541
Sorry?

01:08:17.625 --> 01:08:20.375
My ears. Are you looking at my ears?

01:08:22.041 --> 01:08:23.041
No.

01:08:24.291 --> 01:08:29.125
I had an operation, so there's no need for
anyone looking at my ears anymore.

01:08:29.207 --> 01:08:30.541
I ain't looking at your ears.

01:08:34.416 --> 01:08:36.207
Get out of here. Go on.

01:08:58.082 --> 01:09:00.832
<i>...in the Bay of Pigs.
Nothing went as planned.</i>

01:09:00.916 --> 01:09:02.375
<i>Paratroopers were unable</i>

01:09:02.457 --> 01:09:05.375
<i>to blow up roadways along
the beach area. Castro raced</i>

01:09:05.457 --> 01:09:06.875
<i>toward the scene.</i>

01:09:06.957 --> 01:09:09.166
<i>The underground might have blown up
the roads, but it knew nothing.</i>

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:10.791
<i>Soon Castro had artillery firing</i>

01:09:10.875 --> 01:09:13.707
<i>on the beachhead.
His planes destroyed invading ships</i>

01:09:13.791 --> 01:09:16.250
<i>carrying a brigade of men
and vital ammunition.</i>

01:09:16.332 --> 01:09:18.666
<i>The beachhead could not be enlarged,
and paratroopers</i>

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:22.832
<i>were fighting their way back
to the shore where the invaders</i>

01:09:22.916 --> 01:09:26.707
<i>were pinned down. 1,500 men had been
dumped on the shore without air cover</i>

01:09:26.791 --> 01:09:28.500
<i>or protective fire from ships.</i>

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:32.625
<i>Castro had to wait only until they ran out
of ammunition before mopping them up.</i>

01:09:32.707 --> 01:09:35.957
<i>Later, Castro was to strut around
the invasion area with newsmen</i>

01:09:36.041 --> 01:09:39.750
<i>and expound on the errors that had
been made. He had ample material.</i>

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.832
The United States, already humiliated,

01:09:42.916 --> 01:09:45.791
stood condemned
by most of the countries of the world.

01:09:45.875 --> 01:09:46.832
<i>Ah, shit!</i>

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:50.166
Just as I predicted. They fuck up Cuba,

01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:52.916
Boobie comes after me and the union.

01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:57.875
He's looking for cheap publicity.
That's all it is. That's what he's doing.

01:09:57.958 --> 01:09:59.375
It's gonna blow over.

01:09:59.458 --> 01:10:01.500
How's it gonna blow over?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.125
They'll never forget...

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:07.250
-that I gave money to Nixon!
-Calm down. Jimmy, please.

01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:08.375
We're gonna handle this.

01:10:08.458 --> 01:10:11.500
Some of the old-timers are gonna get to
old man Kennedy.

01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:13.125
He's a little sick, but--

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:14.333
Sick?

01:10:14.416 --> 01:10:17.083
He had a fucking stroke. That's not sick.

01:10:17.166 --> 01:10:19.666
That's you're... you're close
to the grave.

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:21.583
He's become a fucking eggplant.

01:10:21.666 --> 01:10:24.000
You can't blame anybody for that.

01:10:24.083 --> 01:10:27.625
I'm not blaming anybody. But if I were,
it's the Kennedys.

01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:29.791
His kids killed him. I'll tell you that.

01:10:29.875 --> 01:10:32.333
He's not dead, but he's going. He's going.

01:10:32.416 --> 01:10:35.083
They killed him.
They'd give anybody a heart attack.

01:11:10.166 --> 01:11:11.416
Where are you going?

01:11:12.291 --> 01:11:13.583
I'm going to work.

01:11:14.583 --> 01:11:15.833
Go back to sleep.

01:12:05.083 --> 01:12:07.333
<i>All I can say, we will not stop.</i>

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.500
<i>We been doing that for fifty years!</i>

01:12:11.875 --> 01:12:13.416
<i>What good does it do?</i>

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.750
<i>Let the lawyers drive a truck.</i>

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.833
<i>They need their pencils and papers
and their ink pads.</i>

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.250
That's a whole other story.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.916
But we're gonna get through this.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.375
We're gonna get through this legal
bullshit garbage they're throwing at us.

01:12:31.458 --> 01:12:35.166
We're gonna get through it because
"Boobie" Kennedy wants something

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:40.000
doesn't mean the rich boy
is gonna get it. You understand?

01:12:40.833 --> 01:12:43.166
I don't care what he wants.
He's not gonna get it!

01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:48.208
He's not gonna get it because...

01:12:48.708 --> 01:12:50.958
we... are the biggest,

01:12:51.041 --> 01:12:52.583
and best,

01:12:52.666 --> 01:12:55.000
and most honest union

01:12:55.083 --> 01:12:56.416
in this country!

01:12:57.541 --> 01:12:59.500
Yes, I waited for that!

01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:07.416
And you know the operative word
I'm talking about.

01:13:08.041 --> 01:13:09.333
Solidarity.

01:13:09.791 --> 01:13:12.125
And it works. It works for all of us.

01:13:12.208 --> 01:13:16.541
And it works for our friend here
Frank Fitzsimmons!

01:13:17.125 --> 01:13:18.750
Frank Fitzsimmons here,

01:13:19.333 --> 01:13:22.750
my Executive Vice President.
If there's anyone

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:25.375
that can do this job, it's this man here.

01:13:25.458 --> 01:13:27.625
And with him at my back,

01:13:28.166 --> 01:13:30.166
where are we gonna go but up!

01:13:31.833 --> 01:13:33.291
Is that right, Fitz?

01:13:33.791 --> 01:13:36.125
All the way, Jimmy!

01:13:36.208 --> 01:13:39.458
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:51.875
A union man!

01:13:54.166 --> 01:13:57.375
I felt they liked Fitz.
No two ways about it.

01:13:57.458 --> 01:14:00.958
You... you gave Fitz some build up.
I hope he deserves it.

01:14:03.041 --> 01:14:04.833
Why? What's wrong with Fitz?

01:14:06.458 --> 01:14:09.666
I don't know. I don't want to
knock the guy, but...

01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:12.041
Well, you're not knocking him.
Just tell me...

01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:13.666
tell me what you feel.

01:14:14.375 --> 01:14:16.625
He's a loyal guy, I'm sure.

01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:18.666
He's a nice guy, but

01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:21.000
he ain't that sharp. He ain't that smart.

01:14:21.083 --> 01:14:24.208
He's also like a... He plays a lot of
fucking golf.

01:14:24.291 --> 01:14:25.416
He plays golf?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.291
That's what you want from a number two.

01:14:28.875 --> 01:14:30.375
You don't want somebody too smart.

01:14:30.958 --> 01:14:33.458
You want a nice guy. People like him.

01:14:33.541 --> 01:14:35.500
Not dumb, but somebody

01:14:35.583 --> 01:14:39.083
you can have walking behind you
without getting knifed.

01:14:39.166 --> 01:14:41.791
-Well, I hope you're right.
-I'm always right.

01:14:42.375 --> 01:14:44.708
I can sleep like a babe with Fitz.

01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:48.166
It's the Little Guy I have to worry about.

01:14:49.166 --> 01:14:50.458
You know what I'm saying.

01:14:51.333 --> 01:14:52.416
The Little Guy.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:53.666
That's my worry.

01:14:55.416 --> 01:14:56.916
That son of a bitch.

01:14:58.458 --> 01:14:59.458
What's the matter?

01:14:59.541 --> 01:15:01.458
Nothing. Nothing. You're right.

01:15:02.041 --> 01:15:03.458
I'm right. Yeah.

01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:06.291
-You're not perplexed, are you?
-Not at all.

01:15:06.375 --> 01:15:10.000
I... I told you how I felt about Fitz.
Pro. You know.

01:15:10.083 --> 01:15:11.500
Good, because sometimes I feel

01:15:11.583 --> 01:15:14.541
I'm the only one who sees
right through that cocksucker.

01:15:14.625 --> 01:15:17.375
<i>So let's raise a glass</i>

01:15:18.583 --> 01:15:21.416
<i>To the greatest guy</i>

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:27.541
<i>560 is lucky enough to ever have</i>

01:15:28.333 --> 01:15:31.208
<i>You're our boy</i>

01:15:31.291 --> 01:15:34.375
<i>Tony Pro</i>

01:15:34.458 --> 01:15:38.791
<i>We're all yours</i>

01:15:38.875 --> 01:15:41.416
<i>The Little Guy was Tony Provenzano.</i>

01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:43.791
<i>They called him Tony Pro.</i>

01:15:44.375 --> 01:15:46.958
<i>He was a capo in a big Jersey crew and</i>

01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:51.125
<i>the president of Local 560
in Union City, New Jersey.</i>

01:16:18.083 --> 01:16:19.375
<i>Pro and Jimmy...</i>

01:16:20.166 --> 01:16:23.541
<i>came up together
and they were close for a while.</i>

01:16:24.125 --> 01:16:26.791
You turl, you work,

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:29.375
while the corporation kings

01:16:29.458 --> 01:16:31.500
and princes of industry,

01:16:31.583 --> 01:16:36.291
with their vast expense accounts
and salary and luxurous yachts,

01:16:36.375 --> 01:16:39.875
have dedicated themselves
to our destruction.

01:16:39.958 --> 01:16:41.041
Down on them!

01:16:42.875 --> 01:16:45.875
<i>I didn't need nobody
to tell me about Tony Pro.</i>

01:16:45.958 --> 01:16:48.458
<i>No, no. What did I need to know?
I knew enough.</i>

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:58.291
<i>This... this is a man
who had Sally Bugs strangle</i>

01:16:58.375 --> 01:17:00.208
<i>Tony "Three Fingers" Castellito</i>

01:17:00.291 --> 01:17:03.916
<i>just because Three Fingers
was coming up big in the union.</i>

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.458
<i>And it was his own guy, his own guy.</i>

01:17:23.833 --> 01:17:27.375
<i>Tony Pro was so fucking worried that
this guy was gonna beat him out,</i>

01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:29.958
<i>that after he had Sally Bugs
strangle the guy,</i>

01:17:30.041 --> 01:17:32.875
<i>he had Sally stick him
in a fucking tree shredder.</i>

01:17:32.958 --> 01:17:35.875
<i>That way there'd be no competition,
not even from the grave.</i>

01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:37.333
<i>He's out of control.</i>

01:17:37.916 --> 01:17:39.166
<i>What can you do with him?</i>

01:17:40.583 --> 01:17:42.625
He's got a hand in everybody's pocket.

01:17:42.708 --> 01:17:45.583
Shaking down the trucking companies.

01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:46.833
Threatening people.

01:17:48.208 --> 01:17:51.041
You threaten people once in awhile,
I understand.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:52.375
But all the time?

01:17:52.875 --> 01:17:55.083
It's drawing attention to us.

01:17:56.083 --> 01:17:59.333
Guys like that give the unions
a bad name.

01:18:00.416 --> 01:18:02.000
Something's got to be done.

01:18:02.625 --> 01:18:05.083
I mean it. Something's gotta be done.

01:18:05.791 --> 01:18:07.583
Tony being Tony...

01:18:08.666 --> 01:18:10.458
that ain't... that ain't easy.

01:18:11.041 --> 01:18:12.666
I don't mean that.

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:14.041
Not... not that.

01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:17.375
I'm just saying get working guys

01:18:17.458 --> 01:18:19.958
who know the unions,
card-carrying Teamsters,

01:18:20.041 --> 01:18:21.208
like you and me,

01:18:21.958 --> 01:18:23.208
to start running,

01:18:23.291 --> 01:18:25.041
take over some of the locals.

01:18:25.625 --> 01:18:26.750
What do you think?

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:28.500
He ain't gonna like that.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.083
Fuck him. Who the fuck is he?
He's a gangster.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:34.666
I'm the president of the union.

01:18:36.083 --> 01:18:37.291
All I need is some guys

01:18:37.375 --> 01:18:39.583
who know their ways around.

01:18:40.166 --> 01:18:42.875
Know how to handle themselves.
That's all.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.125
That's why I want you to run
for president...

01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:48.291
of Local 326.

01:18:50.958 --> 01:18:53.166
You're like family to me, Frank. You know.

01:18:53.666 --> 01:18:54.958
You, Irene,

01:18:55.541 --> 01:18:56.708
the girls.

01:18:56.791 --> 01:18:58.041
The lovely Peggy.

01:18:58.833 --> 01:19:00.958
But that's not why I'm doing this.

01:19:01.041 --> 01:19:03.958
I'm not giving you anything
you didn't earn,

01:19:04.541 --> 01:19:05.625
you didn't deserve.

01:19:06.958 --> 01:19:07.958
What do you think?

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:13.083
I... I don't know what to say, Jimmy.

01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:15.125
Well, just say you'll do it.

01:19:16.125 --> 01:19:17.750
That's all you got to say.

01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:20.291
Plus, I can guarantee you're gonna win.

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.041
When you run for president...

01:19:24.166 --> 01:19:26.583
of 326, you're gonna win.

01:19:28.083 --> 01:19:29.208
I guarantee it.

01:19:29.916 --> 01:19:32.166
Yeah, okay, I'll do it. Yeah.

01:19:33.833 --> 01:19:34.875
You mean it, huh?

01:19:34.958 --> 01:19:37.208
Yeah. I'm... I'm honored.

01:19:37.291 --> 01:19:39.541
I love you. I just love you, you know.

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:41.750
I love you, man.

01:19:41.833 --> 01:19:43.000
I can't tell ya.

01:19:44.041 --> 01:19:46.000
Gee. This is so good, you know.

01:19:46.083 --> 01:19:48.291
I feel like I can breathe again.

01:19:48.375 --> 01:19:49.416
It's so funny.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.083
Somehow, I...

01:19:52.291 --> 01:19:55.291
I don't know.
I thought you would've said no.

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:58.125
I'm glad you said yes.

01:20:03.416 --> 01:20:06.625
You never reveal how you feel.
It's hard to tell.

01:20:07.208 --> 01:20:08.041
I'm honored, Jimmy.

01:20:08.125 --> 01:20:11.291
I don't... I don't know what to say.

01:20:11.375 --> 01:20:12.250
I'm honored.

01:20:13.416 --> 01:20:14.666
Well, that's good.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.250
That makes me feel good.

01:20:19.333 --> 01:20:20.833
Oh, I can breathe.

01:20:21.875 --> 01:20:23.291
That's so great.

01:20:54.541 --> 01:20:57.541
<i>What can I... I say?
I mean, I owe it all to Jimmy.</i>

01:20:57.625 --> 01:21:00.916
<i>He took me out of a meat truck
and gave me my start.</i>

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.625
<i>He gave me my first charter.
He gave me my first union.</i>

01:21:05.583 --> 01:21:06.583
How are ya?

01:21:07.333 --> 01:21:10.333
Frank Sheeran, the new president
of Union 326.

01:21:10.416 --> 01:21:12.291
-I wanted to introduce myself.
-Nice to meet ya.

01:21:12.875 --> 01:21:14.833
-What's your name?
-My name's Al.

01:21:14.916 --> 01:21:16.291
Nice to meet ya, Al.

01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:18.333
-A little something.
-No, no. Don't need it.

01:21:18.916 --> 01:21:19.750
-Sure?
-Yeah.

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:23.833
Just came to introduce myself.
You need anything, get in touch with me.

01:21:23.916 --> 01:21:24.750
You sure?

01:21:25.875 --> 01:21:28.041
If they can prove

01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:30.875
you stole from them
what they're gonna want are names.

01:21:33.458 --> 01:21:36.833
Would you give up names
to keep from going to jail?

01:21:37.416 --> 01:21:38.291
No.

01:21:38.875 --> 01:21:42.583
You got nothing to worry about.
The lawyers will take care of it.

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:57.583
<i>The Interstate 80 West through
the rest of Pennsylvania,</i>

01:21:58.083 --> 01:22:02.500
<i>and then... then we'd go across Ohio
all the way to Toledo,</i>

01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:06.291
<i>and then we'd go 75 North to Detroit.</i>

01:22:06.958 --> 01:22:09.333
<i>And we'd still get there on time.</i>

01:22:12.125 --> 01:22:14.458
<i>Your Honor, counsel advised my client</i>

01:22:14.541 --> 01:22:19.041
that it was legal for his wife to be
part owner of a trucking business.

01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:22.250
Still, when the McClellan Committee
challenged its legality,

01:22:22.333 --> 01:22:24.541
she withdrew
from the company immediately.

01:22:24.625 --> 01:22:26.708
That should be the end of the matter.

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:30.625
There has not been one indictment served
against my client

01:22:30.708 --> 01:22:32.916
in thirteen grand jury investigations.

01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:38.875
Your Honor, this is an example of
a personal vendetta against my client,

01:22:38.958 --> 01:22:42.583
against his family by a frustrated
Justice Department

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:45.041
and the Attorney General, Robert Kennedy.

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:52.958
He's got a gun!

01:22:58.166 --> 01:22:59.333
Get that gun out of his hand!

01:23:10.208 --> 01:23:11.625
That was not a real gun, was it?

01:23:11.708 --> 01:23:14.375
How'd that gun get in?
How'd it get in here?

01:23:14.458 --> 01:23:16.041
It wasn't my fault!

01:23:17.291 --> 01:23:18.500
Oh, my Chuckie!

01:23:19.083 --> 01:23:20.416
Hey, it's my son!

01:23:20.916 --> 01:23:22.958
That's my kid. I raised this kid.

01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:24.916
You see him? You see what he did?

01:23:27.416 --> 01:23:28.625
I'll tell you this.

01:23:28.708 --> 01:23:31.708
He shot at me,
and it was like a pellet or something.

01:23:31.791 --> 01:23:36.166
I just felt an impact, like I was shot
not even with a BB gun.

01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:37.708
Something even lighter.

01:23:38.208 --> 01:23:39.250
But I charged him.

01:23:39.333 --> 01:23:42.083
I charged him and so did Chuckie.
I taught him well.

01:23:42.666 --> 01:23:46.250
You charge a guy,
always charge a guy with a gun.

01:23:46.333 --> 01:23:47.625
With a knife, you run away.

01:23:48.208 --> 01:23:50.875
Run away from a knife.
You charge with a gun,

01:23:51.375 --> 01:23:52.333
with a knife you run.

01:23:53.416 --> 01:23:54.916
Hey! I rhymed!

01:23:56.541 --> 01:24:00.250
It sounds crazy, but a higher power
told me to shoot Jimmy Hoffa.

01:24:00.333 --> 01:24:01.166
Come with me.

01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:03.416
A lot of nuts in Nashville, Frank.

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.333
Come on down, Frank.

01:24:05.416 --> 01:24:07.208
I got one of them with me now.

01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:11.583
<i>Get down here. Eddie Partin,
from Baton Rouge, is here with me.</i>

01:24:11.666 --> 01:24:12.791
I'll get right down.

01:24:12.875 --> 01:24:14.625
Out of my way, boys.

01:24:22.333 --> 01:24:25.708
Did Mr. Brennan first say, or do you
remember him first saying

01:24:25.791 --> 01:24:28.625
something about,
"I had to change the deal.

01:24:28.708 --> 01:24:30.875
I have to cut Hoffa in"?

01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:33.833
Wasn't that the chronology
of the whole thing?

01:24:33.916 --> 01:24:36.458
I don't know he changed the deal,

01:24:37.041 --> 01:24:39.541
but it was my understanding
that Brennan

01:24:39.625 --> 01:24:41.125
was speaking for himself.

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:42.958
<i>That's an angry woman.</i>

01:24:44.041 --> 01:24:45.875
She was a teacher I think.

01:24:46.375 --> 01:24:49.666
What we're looking at is this one.
This one is not approachable.

01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:51.250
She'd be a tough nut to crack.

01:24:52.583 --> 01:24:56.208
<i>...will hail, stop, and search
all ships bound for Cuba.</i>

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:59.833
<i>If the ships' captains do not stop,
force will be used to stop them.</i>

01:25:03.958 --> 01:25:06.666
Did you make this statement
to the Grand Jury? I'll read it for you.

01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:09.833
"Brennan came to me and said words
to the effect he's gonna go ahead..."

01:25:09.916 --> 01:25:11.541
<i>He's got a restaurant.</i>

01:25:11.625 --> 01:25:12.666
Any violations?

01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:14.041
I'd rather stick with the women.

01:25:14.625 --> 01:25:15.708
They're more approachable.

01:25:15.791 --> 01:25:19.666
<i>...in Cuba of operational
medium-range missiles.</i>

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:23.875
<i>If one of the missiles is launched,
it would probably carry a nuclear warhead.</i>

01:25:24.583 --> 01:25:28.833
<i>It could hit any spot in the southeast
United States, south of Washington.</i>

01:25:29.333 --> 01:25:33.083
<i>We would have no way of intercepting it
or issuing a warning about it.</i>

01:25:33.583 --> 01:25:36.541
This one's married to a State Trooper
named Plechette.

01:25:36.625 --> 01:25:37.916
That's good.

01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:39.833
We know anyone?

01:25:40.583 --> 01:25:43.375
We got an ex-cop, in the Local.

01:25:43.458 --> 01:25:44.583
That's good.

01:25:44.666 --> 01:25:46.916
<i>All our forces are on increased alert.</i>

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:13.333
<i>...said he's gonna go ahead
and set up a company to lease trucks.</i>

01:26:13.416 --> 01:26:16.375
But later, he phoned me and said, quote:

01:26:16.458 --> 01:26:20.666
"I gotta change the deal
'cause I gotta cut Hoffa in on the deal."

01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:21.875
Is that accurate, sir?

01:26:21.958 --> 01:26:24.291
This one's another possibility.

01:26:24.875 --> 01:26:28.291
She's seeing her boyfriend
while she's still married.

01:26:28.375 --> 01:26:30.625
So, maybe we could grab her,

01:26:30.708 --> 01:26:31.791
hold on to her.

01:26:31.875 --> 01:26:33.083
But this guy,

01:26:33.166 --> 01:26:36.083
the construction business.
He has some violations,

01:26:36.166 --> 01:26:39.125
and there's a lien on his house.
His car

01:26:39.208 --> 01:26:40.416
is unpaid.

01:26:40.916 --> 01:26:44.208
That's good. Keep going.
Don't quit while you're ahead.

01:26:51.125 --> 01:26:53.208
Thank you. See you, Big Eddie.

01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:54.125
<i>Do you swear to tell the truth,</i>

01:26:54.208 --> 01:26:57.125
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

01:26:57.208 --> 01:26:58.166
I do.

01:27:05.791 --> 01:27:07.166
Mr. King,

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:11.625
you're a member of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, is that correct?

01:27:11.708 --> 01:27:13.208
I respectfully decline

01:27:13.291 --> 01:27:15.500
to answer that under the...

01:27:15.583 --> 01:27:17.875
protection afforded me by the...

01:27:18.458 --> 01:27:19.500
Fifth Amendment.

01:27:19.583 --> 01:27:21.166
I just asked if you're a Teamster.

01:27:21.250 --> 01:27:24.791
-I respectfully decline to answer.
-All right. Fine.

01:27:24.875 --> 01:27:26.875
I'm gonna show you a photograph.

01:27:26.958 --> 01:27:29.375
-I respectfully decline to answer...
-Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:27:29.458 --> 01:27:30.416
...under the protection--

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.791
Look at the photograph, wait a smidge,
and then you can--

01:27:35.875 --> 01:27:37.291
I want to avail myself...

01:27:37.791 --> 01:27:41.833
of my right under the Constitution.

01:27:41.916 --> 01:27:43.416
Jim, let him avail himself.

01:27:45.041 --> 01:27:46.083
Okay.

01:27:54.166 --> 01:27:55.625
That King's the best.

01:27:56.166 --> 01:27:58.125
He's the best. He's a good guy.

01:27:58.666 --> 01:28:00.541
He really stood up to that jerk.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.125
He was great.

01:28:02.208 --> 01:28:03.250
I love what he did.

01:28:03.333 --> 01:28:06.250
They tried their best to get him.

01:28:06.333 --> 01:28:08.166
-We need more like him.
-Oh, my God!

01:28:09.375 --> 01:28:11.250
<i>More details just arrived.</i>

01:28:12.875 --> 01:28:15.375
<i>These details are not the same
as previously.</i>

01:28:15.458 --> 01:28:16.958
<i>President Kennedy, shot</i>

01:28:17.041 --> 01:28:19.750
<i>as his motorcade left downtown Dallas.</i>

01:28:19.833 --> 01:28:20.958
<i>Mrs. Kennedy</i>

01:28:21.041 --> 01:28:24.166
<i>grabbed Mr. Kennedy.
She called, "Oh, no!"</i>

01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:26.125
<i>The motorcade sped on.</i>

01:28:26.791 --> 01:28:30.083
<i>United Press says
President Kennedy's wounds</i>

01:28:30.166 --> 01:28:32.250
<i>perhaps could be fatal.</i>

01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:35.916
<i>Repeating. A bulletin from CBS News.</i>

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.125
<i>President Kennedy has been shot</i>

01:28:38.208 --> 01:28:41.416
<i>by a would-be assassin in Dallas, Texas.</i>

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:44.333
<i>Stay tuned to CBS News

01:28:48.875 --> 01:28:53.041
<i>It takes more than an instant

01:28:53.125 --> 01:28:56.625
<i>That's why Nescafe has come up
with a new kind of coffee.</i>

01:28:57.125 --> 01:29:01.625

01:29:02.875 --> 01:29:06.958
<i>The flash, apparently official,
President Kennedy died</i>

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:08.875
<i>at one p.m.</i>

<i>Central Standard Time,</i>

<i>two o'clock Eastern Standard Time,</i>

<i>some 38 minutes ago.</i>

<i>Vice President Johnson</i>

<i>in Dallas, but we do not know...</i>

01:29:27.583 --> 01:29:29.208
<i>to where he has proceeded.</i>

01:29:29.291 --> 01:29:33.125
<i>He will be taking
the Oath of Office shortly,</i>

01:29:33.208 --> 01:29:37.541
<i>and become the Thirty-Sixth President
of the United States.</i>

01:29:44.208 --> 01:29:47.041
Mr. Hoffa, will you be attending
the President's funeral?

01:29:47.541 --> 01:29:51.166
-I wasn't invited.
-A million Americans will be there.

01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:54.333
Well... I'll have to check my schedule.

01:29:54.416 --> 01:29:57.291
If you did go, and asked to speak,
what would you say?

01:29:57.375 --> 01:29:58.375
I'd say,

01:29:59.041 --> 01:30:01.208
Bobby Kennedy is just another lawyer now.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.208
Son of a bitch.

01:30:23.375 --> 01:30:25.416
Good, Eric. Thank you very much.

01:30:35.208 --> 01:30:36.708
<i>Jimmy was right.</i>

01:30:38.041 --> 01:30:39.291
<i>Almost.</i>

01:30:40.708 --> 01:30:42.750
<i>That was the end of it with Bobby.</i>

01:30:43.666 --> 01:30:46.750
<i>So much for him being Attorney General.
That was done.</i>

01:30:50.041 --> 01:30:53.000
<i>Bobby's vendetta was over. With us.</i>

01:30:59.083 --> 01:31:00.166
Mr. Hoffa,

01:31:00.916 --> 01:31:05.458
you stand here convicted of having
tampered with the soul of this nation.

01:31:06.041 --> 01:31:08.708
<i>But there was still that jury thing
in Nashville.</i>

01:31:09.291 --> 01:31:10.916
The soul of this nation...

01:31:11.541 --> 01:31:14.208
lies in its sacred processes of justice.

01:31:14.708 --> 01:31:16.333
Justice must be done.

01:31:16.833 --> 01:31:19.958
And for your wicked attempts to
corrupt these processes...

01:31:21.250 --> 01:31:23.208
justice will be done on you.

01:31:24.458 --> 01:31:26.208
We got him now.

01:31:27.166 --> 01:31:30.416
Ladies and gentlemen, we did it!

01:31:47.708 --> 01:31:50.208
<i>But... but Jimmy, he had it all set up.</i>

01:31:50.708 --> 01:31:53.708
<i>Although you knew it was supposed to
look like Fitz</i>

01:31:53.791 --> 01:31:55.333
<i>was the one in charge,</i>

01:31:55.833 --> 01:31:59.125
<i>he gave Fitz his orders through
Bill Bufalino and Allen Dorfman,</i>

01:31:59.208 --> 01:32:00.583
<i>who ran Jimmy's loans.</i>

01:32:00.666 --> 01:32:03.125
Things are good in here? Everything is--

01:32:03.208 --> 01:32:04.291
Everything's terrible.

01:32:04.375 --> 01:32:08.208
You don't sleep at night 'cause
you're afraid someone's gonna knife you.

01:32:08.291 --> 01:32:09.375
You look okay.

01:32:09.458 --> 01:32:11.416
Wh... where's Fitz? He's late.

01:32:12.416 --> 01:32:14.708
We were gonna meet him in the front.

01:32:15.291 --> 01:32:17.958
-Here he is here he is.
-Where the hell have you been?

01:32:18.583 --> 01:32:21.125
What are you doing here?
Why did you come at all?

01:32:21.791 --> 01:32:24.833
Are you aware you're late?
I want to know. You know you're late?

01:32:24.916 --> 01:32:27.875
I'm sorry I'm late,
but we got a lot going on.

01:32:27.958 --> 01:32:32.583
I don't wanna hear that. I wanna hear
something concrete, something straight on.

01:32:33.208 --> 01:32:35.250
Just be a little more patient.

01:32:36.291 --> 01:32:38.291
I'm inside here. I can't be too patient.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.166
<i>As much as Jimmy
was getting pissed off at Fitz,</i>

01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:44.208
<i>everybody else liked him because</i>

01:32:44.291 --> 01:32:48.458
<i>they could get anything out of him they
wanted which they couldn't with Jimmy.</i>

01:32:49.625 --> 01:32:52.500
<i>That's what happens when you go away
to college.</i>

01:32:52.583 --> 01:32:53.583
How's that?

01:32:55.541 --> 01:32:57.750
Jimmy's pissed off with Fitz.

01:32:58.250 --> 01:33:01.250
Fitz is okay. We like Fitz.

01:33:01.333 --> 01:33:03.041
But there's a problem.

01:33:03.125 --> 01:33:06.625
Jimmy's got that ballbusting Dorfman
holding up loans

01:33:06.708 --> 01:33:08.458
that Fitz already okayed.

01:33:09.833 --> 01:33:13.458
I hate Dorfman.
He's such a pain in the ass, fucking Jew.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.458
What do you want me to do?

01:33:18.958 --> 01:33:20.875
No, not that. Not that.

01:33:22.625 --> 01:33:23.875
What you gotta do,

01:33:23.958 --> 01:33:26.416
put a firecracker up Dorfman's ass.

01:33:27.125 --> 01:33:29.000
Fitz'll get the message.

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.208
He'll get the message.

01:33:31.291 --> 01:33:33.291
You can't do it to Fitz.

01:33:34.041 --> 01:33:35.083
That lush

01:33:35.166 --> 01:33:37.583
will run to the Feds
and screw up everything.

01:33:38.208 --> 01:33:39.416
But Dorfman...

01:33:39.916 --> 01:33:41.291
You gotta do it to Dorfman.

01:34:19.875 --> 01:34:20.875
<i>Fitz.</i>

01:34:20.958 --> 01:34:22.166
<i>Fitz got the message.</i>

01:34:25.458 --> 01:34:30.041
<i>After that, anybody who wanted anything
from the pension fund, they got it.</i>

01:34:34.416 --> 01:34:36.833
The thing keeps comin' around.

01:34:36.916 --> 01:34:38.250
What's goin' on?

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:41.625
Who let you in?

01:34:44.041 --> 01:34:45.083
Mr. Provenzano,

01:34:45.166 --> 01:34:48.375
I'm Agent DiGregorio of the FBI.
I have a warrant for your arrest.

01:34:48.458 --> 01:34:50.291
-Can I finish my hand?
-No, sir. Please stand.

01:34:50.375 --> 01:34:51.875
I had a bad fucking hand anyway.

01:34:59.083 --> 01:35:01.583
I got nothing in my pocket.
I got fucking shorts on here.

01:35:01.666 --> 01:35:03.541
Look at this penguin over there.

01:35:03.625 --> 01:35:05.583
Hey, Tony, will you get my bags?

01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:06.875
Yeah, I'll get 'em, Tony.

01:35:06.958 --> 01:35:08.791
This is like watchin' TV.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.166
<i>They got Pro for extortion
and gave him seven years.</i>

01:35:14.291 --> 01:35:16.458
<i>They sent him to Lewisburg prison.</i>

01:35:16.541 --> 01:35:17.708
<i>So who does he end up with?</i>

01:35:18.708 --> 01:35:19.541
<i>Jimmy.</i>

01:35:28.791 --> 01:35:30.041
Look at that.

01:35:30.125 --> 01:35:32.333
A work of art.

01:35:32.416 --> 01:35:33.833
Thank you, Pete.

01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:44.791
I gotta talk to you about a problem
with my pension.

01:35:48.041 --> 01:35:49.041
I know.

01:35:50.166 --> 01:35:51.291
You know?

01:35:52.083 --> 01:35:52.958
What do you know?

01:35:54.541 --> 01:35:55.500
I know...

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.708
you got a million-two,

01:35:57.791 --> 01:36:00.208
and... there's a problem with it.

01:36:02.458 --> 01:36:04.291
So you'll look into it for me?

01:36:04.791 --> 01:36:06.958
How am I going to look into it?

01:36:07.958 --> 01:36:09.250
It is what it is.

01:36:09.916 --> 01:36:11.041
Well, what is it?

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:12.875
You lost it.

01:36:13.375 --> 01:36:16.750
You forfeited it when you came in here.
That's it.

01:36:18.458 --> 01:36:20.333
So is yours forfeited too?

01:36:20.416 --> 01:36:21.416
No.

01:36:23.791 --> 01:36:26.916
Let me get this straight.
Yours is still there,

01:36:27.416 --> 01:36:30.750
your million-five, whatever it is,
but mine's gone?

01:36:31.916 --> 01:36:34.000
Yeah. Mine's still there.

01:36:36.958 --> 01:36:38.458
But we're both in here.

01:36:39.041 --> 01:36:41.000
We're both sitting here. That's right.

01:36:41.083 --> 01:36:43.416
Only we're sitting here
for different things.

01:36:44.208 --> 01:36:46.541
You're sitting here for extortion.

01:36:46.625 --> 01:36:48.833
I'm sitting here for fraud.

01:36:49.416 --> 01:36:50.458
So?

01:36:50.541 --> 01:36:52.541
So, there's a difference.

01:36:52.625 --> 01:36:53.666
What's the difference?

01:36:56.916 --> 01:37:00.125
I didn't threaten anybody, you did.

01:37:00.208 --> 01:37:02.625
-That makes no sense.
-It does.

01:37:02.708 --> 01:37:04.583
It doesn't. I don't want a debate.

01:37:04.666 --> 01:37:07.166
-Think about it.
-I'm thinking about it.

01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:08.416
Don't fuck with me.

01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:10.333
Just do something about it.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.791
"Do something about it"?

01:37:16.875 --> 01:37:19.541
-What am I gonna do?
-There's always something.

01:37:19.625 --> 01:37:20.916
It's federal law.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.750
-I don't care.
-You don't care?

01:37:22.833 --> 01:37:24.541
You can still do something about it.

01:37:25.125 --> 01:37:26.916
What can I do?

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.166
You can get my fucking money.

01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:29.208
How?

01:37:29.291 --> 01:37:30.541
-Some other way.
-What way?

01:37:30.625 --> 01:37:32.083
The same way you got your money. .

01:37:32.708 --> 01:37:34.125
Lower your fucking voice.

01:37:35.041 --> 01:37:37.166
You telling me to lower my voice?

01:37:37.833 --> 01:37:39.000
Cocksucker.

01:37:39.083 --> 01:37:40.500
Don't call me a cocksucker.

01:37:40.583 --> 01:37:42.041
Don't you fucking dare.

01:37:43.375 --> 01:37:45.083
Look, you're here for fraud.

01:37:45.166 --> 01:37:46.333
You stole money.

01:37:46.833 --> 01:37:49.583
I stole money. 0kay, in a different way.

01:37:50.208 --> 01:37:52.166
I want what I'm fucking owed.

01:37:53.666 --> 01:37:55.458
You people. You people.

01:37:55.541 --> 01:37:57.541
-What did you say?
-Oh, my God!

01:37:57.625 --> 01:37:59.000
Come on, what I said.

01:37:59.083 --> 01:38:00.750
What the fuck did I say?

01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:03.708
"You people".
What does that mean, "You people"?

01:38:03.791 --> 01:38:04.791
I'm done...

01:38:05.291 --> 01:38:06.958
talking about this.

01:38:07.583 --> 01:38:09.166
-You people?
-I'm done!

01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:10.083
You're done?

01:38:17.041 --> 01:38:18.500
I'll fucking kill you!

01:38:18.583 --> 01:38:21.291
I'll fucking kill you. Motherfucker!

01:38:21.375 --> 01:38:22.416
What the fuck, you...

01:38:27.791 --> 01:38:30.666
Right then, you knew
it was all gonna fall apart.

01:39:00.583 --> 01:39:03.708
<i>I can't believe that crazy bastard thought
he could do that,</i>

01:39:03.791 --> 01:39:06.958
right there
in front of five thousand people,

01:39:07.041 --> 01:39:08.375
and get away with it.

01:39:08.458 --> 01:39:11.166
I can't believe it. That is not right.

01:39:11.250 --> 01:39:12.416
That is not right.

01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:14.958
That is a total piece of shit.

01:39:15.625 --> 01:39:17.250
That's a piece of shit.

01:39:17.875 --> 01:39:21.875
<i>There's only one guy that would have
the balls, the nerve, the audacity</i>

01:39:21.958 --> 01:39:22.958
<i>to do that.</i>

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.083
<i>He was known Downtown
as "Joey the Blond",</i>

01:39:35.166 --> 01:39:38.125
<i>but everybody,
especially the newspapers,</i>

01:39:38.208 --> 01:39:40.125
<i>called him "Crazy Joe".</i>

01:39:40.208 --> 01:39:44.916
...the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:45.833
I do.

01:39:49.291 --> 01:39:51.750
Mr. Gallo, do you have
an opening statement?

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:54.458
Yeah.

01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:59.875
This carpet would be great
for a crap game.

01:40:04.041 --> 01:40:05.125
<i>Russ was right.</i>

01:40:05.208 --> 01:40:08.416
<i>Who the hell else runs around with
show business people,</i>

01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:12.166
<i>getting his picture in the papers,
drawing attention to himself...</i>

01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:13.916
<i>What is that?</i>

01:40:14.625 --> 01:40:16.541
<i>Who does he think he is? Erroll Flynn?</i>

01:40:17.541 --> 01:40:20.875
He went against everything
and everybody. Just didn't give a shit.

01:40:20.958 --> 01:40:23.625
And, growing up,
he kidnapped his own bosses.

01:40:23.708 --> 01:40:28.458
I... I don't know how he got away
with that. You do that, you die.

01:40:28.541 --> 01:40:29.625
That simple.

01:40:29.708 --> 01:40:34.000
When he went to the can, he recruited
black guys instead of his own kind.

01:40:34.083 --> 01:40:37.125
When he got out,
nobody knew what he was doing.

01:40:37.208 --> 01:40:39.875
We didn't know what was going on.
Nobody did.

01:40:40.375 --> 01:40:43.458
You don't like what he's doing?
Say something,

01:40:43.541 --> 01:40:45.333
and see what happens.

01:41:13.833 --> 01:41:15.958
<i>Who does something like that?</i>

01:41:16.541 --> 01:41:18.000
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

01:41:19.291 --> 01:41:20.791
This <i>disgraziato.</i>

01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:23.166
Him and Oswald. Two of a kind.

01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:26.458
At least in Dallas, it was just Jackie,
not the kids.

01:41:26.958 --> 01:41:29.375
Joey, your doctor called.
You died an hour ago.

01:41:31.625 --> 01:41:32.916
You a Jewish fellow?

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.250
Would you like to be?

01:41:35.125 --> 01:41:37.625
Don't worry about the operation.
We don't do that no more.

01:41:37.708 --> 01:41:38.916
We freeze it.

01:41:39.416 --> 01:41:43.041
You stand there and a Mexican broad
comes over with a wet rock.

01:41:44.625 --> 01:41:47.166
It's okay to laugh.
I make fun of everybody.

01:41:47.250 --> 01:41:49.875
God put us on this earth, to laugh.

01:41:49.958 --> 01:41:51.125
I work everyone.

01:41:51.208 --> 01:41:53.416
I make fun of blacks, of Jews.

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.166
I work Gypsies, Italians.

01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:57.583
Well, not those Italians.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.916
I got the money, Joey. Don't shoot.

01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:03.958
You think he bought it?

01:42:04.041 --> 01:42:07.083
I was told,
"Be very careful about what you say."

01:42:07.875 --> 01:42:11.000
But all kidding aside,
happy birthday, Joey.

01:42:21.958 --> 01:42:22.791
Hey, Russ.

01:42:26.083 --> 01:42:27.000
What's that?

01:42:30.458 --> 01:42:31.541
You believe in that bullshit?

01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:35.041
Well, it's not that.

01:42:35.125 --> 01:42:36.333
It's Italian.

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:37.250
Joey.

01:42:37.333 --> 01:42:38.625
What did I say?

01:42:38.708 --> 01:42:39.666
What did I say?

01:42:41.458 --> 01:42:42.416
Now listen.

01:42:43.666 --> 01:42:46.208
You can't say stuff like that here.

01:42:46.291 --> 01:42:48.125
Why? Only Rickles can make jokes?

01:42:48.208 --> 01:42:49.458
The man's a boss.

01:42:49.541 --> 01:42:52.291
So I'm a boss.
We're all supposed to be brothers.

01:42:52.375 --> 01:42:54.083
I know, but let's not have a beef.

01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:57.000
-We're brothers, right?
-Right, brothers.

01:42:57.083 --> 01:42:58.666
-We're brothers?
-You're brothers.

01:42:58.750 --> 01:43:00.291
-We're brothers.
-I'm not arguing.

01:43:00.375 --> 01:43:03.291
Everybody's a brother. You're a brother.
You're his brother.

01:43:03.375 --> 01:43:06.833
I'm not, but you guys are.
That's why I would like you to...

01:43:06.916 --> 01:43:07.750
All right.

01:43:07.833 --> 01:43:09.375
-We're brothers?
-You're brothers.

01:43:09.916 --> 01:43:11.125
It's my birthday.

01:43:11.208 --> 01:43:13.583
Happy birthday.

01:43:16.041 --> 01:43:17.958
Get the fuck out of here.

01:43:39.583 --> 01:43:43.333
<i>For something like this,
you're gonna need two guns.</i>

01:43:43.416 --> 01:43:46.000
<i>The one you're gonna use and a backup.</i>

01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:50.125
<i>You want something with more
stopping power than a .22.</i>

01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:57.791
<i>You definitely don't want a silencer.</i>

01:43:57.875 --> 01:44:00.833
<i>You want to make a lot of noise,
so the witnesses run away</i>

01:44:00.916 --> 01:44:02.750
<i>and don't look at you.</i>

01:44:05.583 --> 01:44:09.791
<i>But a .45 makes too much noise,
and a patrol car</i>

01:44:09.875 --> 01:44:11.833
<i>can hear it a few blocks away.</i>

01:44:15.708 --> 01:44:18.250
<i>Th... the cops call a .32 a woman's gun.</i>

01:44:18.333 --> 01:44:21.708
<i>It's easier to handle and don't do
the damage a .38 does</i>

01:44:21.791 --> 01:44:24.041
<i>but, you know, it does enough.</i>

01:44:31.708 --> 01:44:35.666
<i>It would be late, so the tourists
from Idaho</i>

01:44:36.166 --> 01:44:38.125
<i>would be in bed.</i>

01:44:38.208 --> 01:44:40.333
<i>And being in Little Italy,</i>

01:44:40.416 --> 01:44:43.375
<i>maybe he'd be more comfortable,
more relaxed.</i>

01:44:44.708 --> 01:44:47.750
<i>It was his birthday,
so he'd be with his wife</i>

01:44:47.833 --> 01:44:50.083
<i>and his kid which, in this case,</i>

01:44:50.166 --> 01:44:52.458
<i>that's good because that's the point.</i>

01:44:52.541 --> 01:44:54.500
<i>They should see what it's like.</i>

01:44:56.291 --> 01:44:57.750
<i>He'd already been drinking,</i>

01:44:58.250 --> 01:45:00.250
<i>which would have
slowed him down a lot.</i>

01:45:01.416 --> 01:45:05.208
<i>His bodyguard would be with him,
and Joey himself could be carrying, too,</i>

01:45:05.291 --> 01:45:07.958
<i>but the piece would be
in his wife's purse, probably.</i>

01:45:14.208 --> 01:45:17.041
<i>You never got a lot of advance notice.</i>

01:45:17.541 --> 01:45:19.583
<i>All you knew was your part of it.</i>

01:45:21.625 --> 01:45:24.208
<i>John the Redhead knew only one thing:</i>

01:45:24.708 --> 01:45:26.541
<i>he was gonna drop me off,</i>

01:45:26.625 --> 01:45:27.541
<i>circle the block,</i>

01:45:28.375 --> 01:45:29.666
<i>and pick me up.</i>

01:45:37.833 --> 01:45:40.333
<i>You wanna take out the bodyguard first.</i>

01:45:40.416 --> 01:45:43.375
<i>Not kill him.
Don't kill him, just disable him.</i>

01:45:43.916 --> 01:45:47.916
<i>You got no argument with him, so,
not in the face or the chest.</i>

01:45:49.375 --> 01:45:52.083
<i>Sometimes with something like this,</i>

01:45:52.166 --> 01:45:54.666
<i>you might want to
go to the bathroom first,</i>

01:45:55.666 --> 01:45:58.250
<i>to be sure nobody followed you in,</i>

01:45:58.333 --> 01:46:02.416
<i>and to make sure nobody is in
the bathroom you have to worry about.</i>

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.041
<i>And you should go to the bathroom.
You don't want to be uncomfortable.</i>

01:46:07.666 --> 01:46:12.708
<i>But I went before, and in a place this
small, you might as well just get to work.</i>

01:46:13.208 --> 01:46:14.500
We need more wine.

01:46:15.083 --> 01:46:16.500
Hey, Tommy, some more wine.

01:46:26.958 --> 01:46:28.041
Shit!

01:47:04.375 --> 01:47:06.416
<i>It happened in New York's Little Italy,</i>

01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:09.791
<i>an area rumored to be neutral territory
among mobsters.</i>

01:47:09.875 --> 01:47:11.041
<i>After the killing,</i>

01:47:11.125 --> 01:47:15.041
<i>police found several guns and some
fingerprints which they were tracing.</i>

01:47:15.125 --> 01:47:18.958
<i>Joseph "Crazy Joe" Gallo had come
to the seafood restaurant</i>

01:47:19.041 --> 01:47:22.666
<i>to cap an evening of celebration with
his new bride</i>

01:47:22.750 --> 01:47:25.458
<i>and his eleven-year-old daughter
by a previous marriage.</i>

01:47:25.541 --> 01:47:29.416
<i>They were celebrating
Joe's 47th birthday.</i>

01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:32.958
<i>They had been to a nightclub
early in the evening and were sitting</i>

01:47:33.041 --> 01:47:36.625
<i>at a rear table, this group of six...</i>

01:47:37.125 --> 01:47:38.250
<i>when a...</i>

01:47:39.208 --> 01:47:40.291
<i>a man walked in</i>

01:47:40.375 --> 01:47:43.708
<i>from the back door,
and he walked up to...</i>

01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:47.750
<i>to the side of the table.
He fired three shots.</i>

01:47:47.833 --> 01:47:49.916
<i>He hit Joe twice,</i>

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.250
<i>and he hit his bodyguard,</i>

01:47:51.333 --> 01:47:53.458
<i>Pete the Greek, one time.</i>

01:47:53.541 --> 01:47:56.000
<i>A total of fourteen shots were fired.</i>

01:47:56.083 --> 01:47:57.291
Peggy, come on.

01:47:57.791 --> 01:48:01.250
<i>It's quiet here on President Street,
Joey Gallo's turf.</i>

01:48:01.958 --> 01:48:03.583
<i>In fact, it's too quiet.</i>

01:48:04.083 --> 01:48:06.708
<i>Out here in Brooklyn,
Joey Gallo was a hero.</i>

01:48:06.791 --> 01:48:10.375
<i>Speculation has it that his death
may start a gang war,</i>

01:48:10.458 --> 01:48:12.333
<i>if it hasn't already begun.</i>

01:48:46.291 --> 01:48:48.500
-Take it easy, Jimmy.
-You too, Mikey.

01:48:48.583 --> 01:48:49.708
Take good care, Jimmy.

01:48:50.208 --> 01:48:51.791
If I don't see you again, hello.

01:48:51.875 --> 01:48:52.958
<i>Four years later,</i>

01:48:53.041 --> 01:48:57.125
<i>and $500,000 under the table
to Nixon's re-election committee,</i>

01:48:57.208 --> 01:48:59.125
<i>Jimmy finally got what he wanted.</i>

01:48:59.208 --> 01:49:00.791
Sorry, but I won't be back.

01:49:00.875 --> 01:49:04.041
<i>A Presidential pardon and his parole.</i>

01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:06.958
What are you gonna do now?

01:49:07.541 --> 01:49:09.875
The first thing I'm gonna do is register

01:49:10.375 --> 01:49:12.708
with the Federal Probation Office,

01:49:12.791 --> 01:49:16.333
then I'm going down to Florida
with my wife to get some sun.

01:49:16.416 --> 01:49:17.500
Any plans after that?

01:49:17.583 --> 01:49:20.416
Yeah, take back control of my union.

01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:22.083
How will you do that, Jimmy?

01:49:23.291 --> 01:49:25.958
-How do you like Fitz running against you?
-I don't.

01:49:26.041 --> 01:49:28.125
What was it like being locked up?

01:49:28.208 --> 01:49:29.541
Wonderful. Had a great time.

01:49:31.458 --> 01:49:32.625
<i>The first thing I did</i>

01:49:32.708 --> 01:49:35.000
<i>was pick us up some chili dogs
from Lum's.</i>

01:49:35.083 --> 01:49:37.291
<i>Jimmy loved them
almost as much as ice cream.</i>

01:49:37.375 --> 01:49:41.000
<i>A consultant to President Richard Nixon's
re-election campaign committee.</i>

01:49:41.083 --> 01:49:43.333
<i>The secret is they steam them in beer.</i>

01:49:43.416 --> 01:49:45.500
<i>It's the best hot dog in America.</i>

01:49:45.583 --> 01:49:49.666
<i>McCord and his accomplices brought
listening devices</i>

01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:52.541
<i>with them and had removed
two ceiling panels...</i>

01:49:52.625 --> 01:49:55.291
<i>...while installing
eavesdropping equipment</i>

01:49:55.375 --> 01:49:57.041
<i>at the Democratic National Committee.</i>

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.125
Look at this. He's got the balls to run
for President of the Teamsters.

01:50:01.208 --> 01:50:03.166
And Tony Pro giving him an award.

01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:05.375
This fuck. Do you believe it?

01:50:05.458 --> 01:50:08.083
Fitz is very popular with certain people.

01:50:08.166 --> 01:50:10.000
Of course he's popular.

01:50:10.083 --> 01:50:12.541
He loans money to every goombah who asks.

01:50:13.125 --> 01:50:15.916
That's why Tony's behind him.
He's given Fitz all his votes.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.083
You got great support
from most of the union.

01:50:18.166 --> 01:50:21.333
All you need is Tony Pro's voters
in the Northeast to win.

01:50:21.416 --> 01:50:22.916
You want one of these?

01:50:23.541 --> 01:50:27.541
I just can't believe I gotta go
to Tony Pro to get votes.

01:50:27.625 --> 01:50:28.625
What is that?

01:50:31.041 --> 01:50:33.000
Tony has Fitz in his pocket.

01:50:33.083 --> 01:50:34.666
Wiseguys don't run the union.

01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:36.166
With Fitz they do.

01:50:37.041 --> 01:50:39.583
Jimmy, once you're back as president,

01:50:39.666 --> 01:50:40.791
you can do anything you want.

01:50:40.875 --> 01:50:42.458
You can fire anybody.

01:50:42.541 --> 01:50:44.583
You can even fire Tony Pro.

01:50:46.333 --> 01:50:48.666
You could stand over him as he clears out
his desk.

01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:50.625
You could strip-search the guy.

01:50:51.333 --> 01:50:53.666
Make sure he doesn't walk off
with a paper clip.

01:50:54.416 --> 01:50:55.708
See. Did you hear that?

01:50:57.250 --> 01:51:00.208
Everybody thinks Jo's the nice one
and I'm the bad guy.

01:51:00.791 --> 01:51:02.041
But it's opposite.

01:51:02.791 --> 01:51:05.500
She's the killer, and I'm the sweetheart.

01:51:06.916 --> 01:51:09.291
Now I have to make peace
with the cocksucker.

01:51:09.375 --> 01:51:12.166
"Oh, I want to make up with you.

01:51:12.791 --> 01:51:15.541
I need you to endorse me. Please, Tony."

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:20.708
I'm not gonna get through this.

01:51:20.791 --> 01:51:22.666
You just gotta talk to him. Just...

01:51:23.166 --> 01:51:24.666
-You gotta deal with it.
<i>-Let the chips fall</i>

01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:27.083
<i>-where they may.</i>
-Oh, he is a cocksucker, though.

01:51:28.041 --> 01:51:30.416
If I sat down with him
would you come along?

01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:31.583
Of course.

01:51:31.666 --> 01:51:33.208
How could I not go with you?

01:51:42.791 --> 01:51:43.958
Fuck it. Let's go.

01:51:44.041 --> 01:51:47.583
Jimmy, Jimmy. Give it a chance.
Give it a few more minutes.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.750
This isn't right.

01:51:51.833 --> 01:51:55.083
You don't do this.
You don't keep a man waiting.

01:51:55.166 --> 01:51:56.416
I know. I know.

01:51:57.666 --> 01:51:59.583
The only time you do

01:51:59.666 --> 01:52:02.000
is when you want to say something.

01:52:03.291 --> 01:52:05.000
When you want to say "Fuck you."

01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:06.791
That's the only time.

01:52:08.083 --> 01:52:08.916
Here they are.

01:52:10.958 --> 01:52:12.583
Can you believe this weather, Frank?

01:52:13.333 --> 01:52:15.041
It's 85 degrees outside.

01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:17.750
Hey, Tony Jack.

01:52:19.083 --> 01:52:22.416
People freezing to death in New York,
and look at us.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.500
I don't know why we don't live here
year-round.

01:52:27.333 --> 01:52:28.583
It's summer.

01:52:28.666 --> 01:52:29.500
What?

01:52:30.208 --> 01:52:31.083
It's summer.

01:52:32.250 --> 01:52:34.500
People aren't freezing to death
in New York.

01:52:35.916 --> 01:52:37.166
It's summer.

01:52:39.416 --> 01:52:42.750
To me, it's always 8 degrees in New York.
I'm making a point.

01:52:43.250 --> 01:52:44.541
You're making a point.

01:52:45.125 --> 01:52:46.916
Making a point dressing like that?

01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:48.666
You dress like that for a meeting?

01:52:50.541 --> 01:52:54.041
This is how you dress in Florida?
In a suit?

01:52:54.125 --> 01:52:55.416
For a meeting?

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.750
Anywhere. Florida, Timbuktu,
I dress in a suit. For a meetin'.

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:02.500
And you're late.

01:53:02.583 --> 01:53:03.875
What?

01:53:04.375 --> 01:53:05.416
You're late.

01:53:07.458 --> 01:53:08.708
There was traffic.

01:53:10.791 --> 01:53:11.958
Wasn't there traffic?

01:53:12.041 --> 01:53:13.333
There was traffic.

01:53:13.416 --> 01:53:14.583
What do you want from us?

01:53:14.666 --> 01:53:16.500
It was bumper to fuckin' bumper.

01:53:16.583 --> 01:53:17.875
It's bad, you know?

01:53:17.958 --> 01:53:18.875
Traffic.

01:53:19.708 --> 01:53:22.750
I never waited for anyone who was late...

01:53:23.375 --> 01:53:26.000
more than ten minutes in my life.

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:28.333
Fifteen. Fifteen's right.

01:53:28.416 --> 01:53:29.541
No, ten.

01:53:30.750 --> 01:53:34.375
Ten's not enough.
You have to take traffic into account.

01:53:34.458 --> 01:53:37.333
That's what I'm doing.
I'm taking traffic into account.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.250
-That's why it's ten.
-I still say fifteen.

01:53:40.333 --> 01:53:41.166
Ten.

01:53:42.125 --> 01:53:44.250
Fine. We disagree on that.

01:53:44.333 --> 01:53:46.291
How about twelve and a half minutes?

01:53:47.333 --> 01:53:49.458
The middle. Right in the middle.
Beautiful.

01:53:50.041 --> 01:53:51.208
More than ten,

01:53:52.291 --> 01:53:53.708
you're saying something.

01:53:54.666 --> 01:53:55.666
You saying something?

01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:56.875
I'm here.

01:53:58.083 --> 01:53:59.541
It says what it says.

01:54:01.416 --> 01:54:02.583
There it is.

01:54:04.083 --> 01:54:05.333
Where do we go from here?

01:54:08.041 --> 01:54:09.750
Well, what can I do for you?

01:54:12.916 --> 01:54:14.250
I want you.

01:54:18.708 --> 01:54:20.458
I want you to endorse me...

01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:24.083
for you know what.

01:54:25.041 --> 01:54:27.791
Let's straighten
that other thing up first.

01:54:27.875 --> 01:54:30.083
No. The other thing
is none of my business.

01:54:30.166 --> 01:54:32.458
I can't do anything about your pension.

01:54:32.541 --> 01:54:36.166
I can't. Not with Fitz in there.
Fitz is in there.

01:54:36.250 --> 01:54:38.083
-You go to Fitz.
-I did.

01:54:38.166 --> 01:54:41.000
I did. He said he'll take care of it,
no questions asked.

01:54:41.083 --> 01:54:43.000
You wouldn't do that, but he will.

01:54:43.708 --> 01:54:45.291
I meant the other thing.

01:54:47.083 --> 01:54:48.166
What other thing?

01:54:48.250 --> 01:54:49.541
You know.

01:54:49.625 --> 01:54:50.958
I don't know.

01:54:51.041 --> 01:54:52.250
Your apology.

01:54:54.416 --> 01:54:55.708
My apology?

01:54:57.291 --> 01:54:58.625
My apology for what?

01:54:58.708 --> 01:55:02.583
For what you said when you were eating
your ice cream like some fucking king.

01:55:03.916 --> 01:55:06.416
That was an ethnic slur. "You people".

01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:08.875
Did you know what he said?

01:55:08.958 --> 01:55:11.333
I heard you had an altercation in the can.

01:55:11.416 --> 01:55:13.041
Yeah, "you people".

01:55:14.416 --> 01:55:16.416
That's what you said. Right, Jim?

01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:20.083
"You people". Am I beneath you?

01:55:22.041 --> 01:55:23.291
Definitely.

01:55:23.375 --> 01:55:24.708
Jimmy, come on.

01:55:25.291 --> 01:55:27.458
"You people" got you where you are.

01:55:27.541 --> 01:55:29.333
Don't tell me that.

01:55:29.416 --> 01:55:30.583
That's your problem.

01:55:30.666 --> 01:55:32.875
Your problem is you're a piece of shit.

01:55:32.958 --> 01:55:33.875
Jimmy, come on.

01:55:33.958 --> 01:55:35.833
Jesus, Jimmy, come on.

01:55:35.916 --> 01:55:37.916
I asked for your endorsement.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.041
I asked for your apology.

01:55:39.125 --> 01:55:41.500
Who the fuck are you to apologize to?

01:55:42.875 --> 01:55:44.416
Who the fuck are you?

01:55:45.416 --> 01:55:46.666
I don't need this.

01:55:47.333 --> 01:55:49.291
I need this? I need you?

01:55:49.375 --> 01:55:50.791
You need me.

01:55:50.875 --> 01:55:52.333
Come on. You're asking for something.

01:55:52.416 --> 01:55:55.458
The guy gets me nervous.
He gets me upset.

01:55:55.958 --> 01:55:58.458
Everybody's here.
Let's have the fucking meeting.

01:55:59.291 --> 01:56:00.875
Let's talk. That's all.

01:56:00.958 --> 01:56:01.958
He's here.

01:56:06.416 --> 01:56:08.000
Same altercation youse had in the can?

01:56:08.583 --> 01:56:11.541
Yeah, something like this.
We got to arm wrestling.

01:56:12.583 --> 01:56:13.416
He lost.

01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:15.625
I lost. You should see his ribs.

01:56:16.583 --> 01:56:19.916
Why don't you just talk about
what you need to talk about.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.416
What do you want me to do?

01:56:22.125 --> 01:56:25.000
I said "you people".
You want me to apologize for it?

01:56:25.083 --> 01:56:27.708
That's exactly what I want. An apology.

01:56:27.791 --> 01:56:29.541
I'll apologize for it...

01:56:29.625 --> 01:56:30.791
That's all I want.

01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:34.541
...after you apologize

01:56:34.625 --> 01:56:35.916
for being late...

01:56:36.666 --> 01:56:39.041
you motherfucking wop cocksucker.

01:56:40.291 --> 01:56:42.458
Jimmy, you're out of your fucking mind.

01:56:42.541 --> 01:56:46.750
I'll apologize after I kidnap your
granddaughter, rip her guts out

01:56:46.833 --> 01:56:48.500
and send them to you in an envelope!

01:56:52.833 --> 01:56:54.958
Get him the fuck off! Come on!

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:57.166
-I'll fucking kill him!
-Come on, Tony!

01:57:02.916 --> 01:57:04.625
You think Russ would...

01:57:04.708 --> 01:57:06.583
would do something about this guy?

01:57:07.375 --> 01:57:09.041
That's complicated.

01:57:10.125 --> 01:57:11.375
Yeah. It's complicated.

01:57:11.458 --> 01:57:15.666
I'd like to clip the motherfucker myself,
get the okay from them. But...

01:57:16.333 --> 01:57:17.750
This guy's gotta go.

01:57:18.375 --> 01:57:19.541
He's gotta go, Frank.

01:57:20.250 --> 01:57:22.208
I won't get the okay to do that.

01:57:23.583 --> 01:57:25.541
Frank, just talk to the guy.

01:57:26.125 --> 01:57:27.708
Okay? Just talk to him.

01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:40.000
<i>The guys from Jersey called me about this
bullshit between these two guys.</i>

01:57:40.083 --> 01:57:42.541
I'm gonna tell you the same thing
I told them.

01:57:43.291 --> 01:57:45.833
I don't approve of what Pro said
about Jimmy.

01:57:46.416 --> 01:57:49.291
Who talks like that about
a person's grandchildren?

01:57:49.375 --> 01:57:50.708
It's not fucking right.

01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:58.083
But Pro isn't nobody.

01:57:58.750 --> 01:58:00.208
Jimmy should know that.

01:58:00.791 --> 01:58:04.375
Hey, I can't tell this guy
what he can and can't fucking say,

01:58:04.458 --> 01:58:05.625
like he's a child.

01:58:07.166 --> 01:58:09.083
Jimmy don't mean nothing.
He's just upset.

01:58:09.166 --> 01:58:11.000
Russ, we all know he's a fucking hothead.

01:58:11.083 --> 01:58:12.333
We all are sometimes.

01:58:12.416 --> 01:58:14.750
But Jimmy says things he shouldn't say.

01:58:14.833 --> 01:58:16.375
We all do that too.

01:58:16.458 --> 01:58:18.541
Well, somebody should calm him down.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.791
Yeah, well, that... I'm gonna... I'm gonna
calm him down. He's difficult, but...

01:58:26.875 --> 01:58:28.791
Maybe this could help calm him down.

01:58:28.875 --> 01:58:30.625
Tell him that I always liked him...

01:58:32.666 --> 01:58:35.750
and won't stand in his way trying to
get his job back.

01:58:35.833 --> 01:58:38.000
I will. I will tell him that, Tony. Yes.

01:58:38.583 --> 01:58:40.583
That's not making me calm down.

01:58:40.666 --> 01:58:42.000
Standing by me.

01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:44.541
What the fuck does that mean?

01:58:44.625 --> 01:58:48.125
Standing by me ain't the same thing
as doing something

01:58:48.208 --> 01:58:51.625
about some out-of-control
fucking psycho!

01:58:52.208 --> 01:58:55.208
The Little Guy ain't a nobody.
You gotta understand.

01:58:55.791 --> 01:58:58.666
He's a cocksucker. Fitz is a cocksucker.

01:58:59.541 --> 01:59:01.625
I'm gonna deal with
both these cocksuckers...

01:59:02.125 --> 01:59:03.166
myself!

01:59:04.125 --> 01:59:06.208
This used to be my office.

01:59:06.291 --> 01:59:07.750
Look for Frank Fitzsimmons there.

01:59:08.333 --> 01:59:09.375
You're not gonna find him.

01:59:09.958 --> 01:59:12.458
That's because he travels
all over the country,

01:59:12.541 --> 01:59:15.750
to every goddamn golf course,
because that's what he does.

01:59:15.833 --> 01:59:16.916
<i>He plays golf.</i>

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.791
<i>Who is he to run around with Nixon
and the Attorney General?</i>

01:59:20.875 --> 01:59:24.916
<i>He does this and collects
a full-time salary while he's doing it.</i>

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.250
<i>Now how do you do that?</i>

01:59:26.333 --> 01:59:29.291
<i>There's not enough hours in a day.</i>

01:59:29.375 --> 01:59:31.541
<i>I was sent to prison for fraud.</i>

01:59:32.250 --> 01:59:33.458
<i>This is fraud.</i>

01:59:35.916 --> 01:59:38.208
<i>So what's Fitz's answer to Jimmy?</i>

01:59:38.291 --> 01:59:42.416
<i>He sends a message to Jimmy's
old friend, Dave Johnson.</i>

01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:45.833
<i>Now Dave Johnson, he ran Local 299.</i>

01:59:47.416 --> 01:59:48.958
<i>This was the message.</i>

01:59:53.166 --> 01:59:54.416
<i>So this is how</i>

01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:57.333
Fitz says
he wants my old pal Dave Johnson

01:59:57.416 --> 02:00:00.041
to step down, so he can have his son

02:00:00.125 --> 02:00:02.375
take over Local 299.

02:00:03.125 --> 02:00:05.500
This is how I'm gonna say no to his son,

02:00:05.583 --> 02:00:07.250
Little fucking Fitz.

02:00:08.791 --> 02:00:11.750
She looked a lot like your mother.
About the same size.

02:00:11.833 --> 02:00:14.208
Good-looking girl.
She was a good-looking girl.

02:00:14.291 --> 02:00:17.666
But I had no idea that
it wasn't your mother. It was dark.

02:00:26.833 --> 02:00:30.541
<i>This is how Fitz says
he doesn't like who I say</i>

02:00:30.625 --> 02:00:31.916
<i>runs the 299.</i>

02:00:32.416 --> 02:00:34.041
<i>By firing my wife</i>

02:00:34.125 --> 02:00:38.083
from her forty-eight fucking thousand
dollar a year union job!

02:01:21.166 --> 02:01:23.541
Son of a bitch. Fuck him!

02:01:24.125 --> 02:01:28.291
<i>He had taped the lock on the entry door
of the basement of the Watergate.</i>

02:01:28.375 --> 02:01:29.500
What are you looking at?

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.083
It's Big Ears.

02:01:32.708 --> 02:01:35.375
<i>He noticed that
the tape had been removed...</i>

02:01:36.416 --> 02:01:38.750
<i>and he re-taped the door.</i>

02:01:39.458 --> 02:01:40.291
Big Ears?

02:01:42.291 --> 02:01:43.958
Somebody I met a long time ago.

02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:48.000
His ears ain't so big.

02:01:49.125 --> 02:01:52.541
<i>I said, "Let us junk it",
meaning let us scrap the operation.</i>

02:01:53.125 --> 02:01:56.708
<i>Mr. Liddy and Mr. McCord
talked between themselves,</i>

02:01:56.791 --> 02:01:59.583
<i>and the decision was made to go.</i>

02:02:00.958 --> 02:02:02.916
<i>Do you feel Frank Fitzsimmons</i>

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.416
should remain
president of the Teamsters?

02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:06.333
Absolutely not.

02:02:06.916 --> 02:02:11.125
Frank Fitzsimmons has sold his union out
to his underworld pals.

02:02:11.208 --> 02:02:12.833
<i>The Mob controls him,</i>

02:02:13.458 --> 02:02:16.541
<i>which means it controls
our Pension Fund.</i>

02:02:16.625 --> 02:02:19.541
<i>That's a billion dollars in low
or no-interest loans</i>

02:02:19.625 --> 02:02:23.916
<i>this man has given to known racketeers
for their illegal enterprises.</i>

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.000
<i>Not anymore.</i>

02:02:25.583 --> 02:02:28.500
<i>It's time for the rats to abandon ship.</i>

02:02:28.583 --> 02:02:29.666
Is he serious?

02:02:30.333 --> 02:02:32.458
Not Jimmy. This is all publicity.

02:02:32.541 --> 02:02:34.958
He's running for office. It's all a show.

02:02:35.041 --> 02:02:37.291
It's all puff. It's got no substance.

02:02:37.375 --> 02:02:39.291
Maybe he means what he says.

02:02:39.375 --> 02:02:41.791
Tony, he's campaigning.

02:02:41.875 --> 02:02:43.875
He's liable to say any fucking thing.

02:02:43.958 --> 02:02:45.666
I don't care if he's campaigning.

02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:49.375
-He can't fucking talk like that.
-I understand.

02:02:49.458 --> 02:02:51.291
You know what he should do, Russ?

02:02:51.375 --> 02:02:53.583
He should cash in that big pension of his.

02:02:53.666 --> 02:02:55.875
Spend more time with his grandchildren.

02:02:56.875 --> 02:02:57.708
Got a beautiful family.

02:03:00.375 --> 02:03:01.708
He should relax.

02:03:03.875 --> 02:03:05.375
Word should get back to him.

02:03:11.708 --> 02:03:13.000
<i>Don't take this</i>

02:03:13.083 --> 02:03:14.041
the wrong way.

02:03:14.541 --> 02:03:17.291
I was with some people,
you know who they are,

02:03:17.875 --> 02:03:19.000
they were saying...

02:03:20.416 --> 02:03:23.250
"Please tell Jimmy we love the guy.

02:03:23.333 --> 02:03:25.916
We don't want any problem.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.750
We just think that he should...

02:03:28.708 --> 02:03:33.166
enjoy his grandchildren,
enjoy his pension, enjoy his life as is."

02:03:33.250 --> 02:03:34.791
Go no further, Frank.

02:03:36.708 --> 02:03:37.666
Who said it?

02:03:39.041 --> 02:03:41.875
-It don't matter who said it.
-Oh, it matters.

02:03:41.958 --> 02:03:43.125
Was it Russell?

02:03:43.875 --> 02:03:46.583
Of course, it's not Russell.
It's that little cocksucker

02:03:46.666 --> 02:03:48.541
from the Miami fiasco?

02:03:49.833 --> 02:03:50.916
Not him. No?

02:03:51.541 --> 02:03:52.666
Then who?

02:03:55.250 --> 02:03:56.666
I'm gonna tell you.

02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:57.750
Tony.

02:03:59.625 --> 02:04:00.875
Which Tony?

02:04:00.958 --> 02:04:02.291
They're all named Tony.

02:04:03.041 --> 02:04:06.583
What's the matter with Italians?
They can only think of one name.

02:04:08.416 --> 02:04:09.625
It's the other Tony.

02:04:11.375 --> 02:04:12.541
What Tony?

02:04:15.458 --> 02:04:16.583
Salerno.

02:04:25.166 --> 02:04:26.833
Well, what can I say?

02:04:28.791 --> 02:04:31.083
I'm trying to help you.
I'm trying to tell you something.

02:04:32.875 --> 02:04:35.125
Frank, don't even think about it.

02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:38.750
I don't keep my mouth shut for anyone.

02:04:38.833 --> 02:04:42.333
I know that, you know that,
they don't know that.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.458
That's who I am, that's what I am,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

02:04:49.083 --> 02:04:50.791
Somebody can tell him that.

02:04:50.875 --> 02:04:52.166
He said that?

02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:54.166
In so many words.

02:04:54.750 --> 02:04:56.291
Before he says something like that,

02:04:56.375 --> 02:04:59.708
he should remember that Joe Gallo
liked to make a lot of fucking noise, too.

02:04:59.791 --> 02:05:01.416
You tell him that.

02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:02.750
Who said?

02:05:04.250 --> 02:05:05.708
-Tony.
-He said that?

02:05:06.291 --> 02:05:08.083
Oh, that's it. That does it.

02:05:09.541 --> 02:05:11.250
I'm never gonna retire now.

02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:13.375
Tell him that.

02:05:13.958 --> 02:05:15.666
Jimmy, I told him over and over.

02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:18.375
You told him. Let's stop this. Forget it.

02:05:18.458 --> 02:05:19.416
Enough.

02:05:20.333 --> 02:05:22.125
Let me enjoy my ice cream here.

02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:28.791
What's the matter?

02:05:29.375 --> 02:05:30.250
Nothing.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.500
-What?
-Nothing.

02:05:33.083 --> 02:05:34.750
You're thinking something. What?

02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:39.958
What are you doing?

02:05:40.041 --> 02:05:42.000
-It ain't the right time.
-Not the right time?

02:05:42.083 --> 02:05:43.833
What isn't the right time?

02:05:43.916 --> 02:05:44.791
Say it.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.958
The Local's putting together

02:05:49.041 --> 02:05:51.666
a testimonial dinner for... for me and--

02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:53.250
A testimonial dinner. Good.

02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:55.791
But later. Later. Later, when you're...

02:05:56.375 --> 02:05:57.291
What's the matter?

02:06:01.625 --> 02:06:05.916
I was gonna a... ask you if...
if you would present the award to me.

02:06:09.166 --> 02:06:10.791
That's nice of you, Frank.

02:06:10.875 --> 02:06:12.541
Really. That's nice of you.

02:06:13.791 --> 02:06:14.833
Who's gonna be there?

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.541
-Everybody.
-Tony.

02:06:18.291 --> 02:06:21.291
Tony, Tony, Tony, and Tony.

02:06:23.208 --> 02:06:24.708
Everybody from Downtown.

02:06:26.375 --> 02:06:31.041
It ain't a good idea. Everybody's gonna
be there. You're gonna be uncomfortable.

02:06:31.125 --> 02:06:34.208
I don't give a fuck who's there.

02:06:34.291 --> 02:06:35.708
Those cocksuckers

02:06:35.791 --> 02:06:38.708
can't keep me from your big night.
There's no way.

02:06:40.083 --> 02:06:41.541
I'm gonna be there.

02:06:42.041 --> 02:06:43.750
I'll be honored to be there.

02:06:43.833 --> 02:06:45.125
You deserve this.

02:06:45.208 --> 02:06:46.833
Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you.

02:06:50.291 --> 02:06:52.125
Oh, that Mo Dean.

02:06:53.458 --> 02:06:55.000
-She's a good-looking broad.
-She's nice.

02:06:55.083 --> 02:06:55.916
<i>I did not realize...</i>

02:06:56.791 --> 02:06:58.791
that Mr. Howard Hunt worked

02:06:58.875 --> 02:07:01.916
while he was at the White House
in the plumbers unit.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.166
He's a rat, but that's, you know.

02:07:04.250 --> 02:07:05.708
He's a smart rat.

02:07:09.083 --> 02:07:10.625
We've got a great crowd

02:07:10.708 --> 02:07:12.625
for Frank tonight. Come on. Give it up.

02:07:15.833 --> 02:07:20.125
That's because Frank is a man
with a lot of friends.

02:07:22.791 --> 02:07:25.208
From his war buddies
who fought with him in Italy

02:07:25.291 --> 02:07:27.583
under General George Patton...

02:07:29.083 --> 02:07:30.416
to the drivers,

02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:32.125
national organizers...

02:07:38.875 --> 02:07:41.083
We are all friends

02:07:41.166 --> 02:07:42.500
of Frank's tonight.

02:07:43.041 --> 02:07:44.500
Friends of Frank.

02:07:46.416 --> 02:07:49.250
Like NAACP president Cecil Moore.

02:07:50.750 --> 02:07:52.958
District Attorney Emmett Fitzpatrick.

02:07:54.416 --> 02:07:56.583
Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo.

02:07:58.708 --> 02:08:00.166
Hey, they like you, Frank.

02:08:00.791 --> 02:08:04.750
And, of course, our featured speaker,
James Riddell Hoffa.

02:08:12.416 --> 02:08:14.583
And outside in the trees,

02:08:14.666 --> 02:08:16.291
we got the FBI.

02:08:17.875 --> 02:08:19.041
Who wants to check on them?

02:08:21.208 --> 02:08:24.916
The first time I met Frank, he took me out
to a steak dinner,

02:08:25.500 --> 02:08:27.458
and he asked me,
"How do you like your steak?"

02:08:27.541 --> 02:08:29.416
I like it rare. He said, "Me too."

02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:31.500
They bring out the steaks.
Mine's rare.

02:08:31.583 --> 02:08:33.500
Frank's was walking from the kitchen.

02:08:35.458 --> 02:08:39.500
He says, "Well, I'm an animal lover.
I don't want to hurt it."

02:08:41.541 --> 02:08:42.875
He's an animal lover.

02:09:07.416 --> 02:09:11.166
He's not even the damn president
and he's holding up people's loans.

02:09:11.958 --> 02:09:12.916
You sure?

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:13.875
I'm sure.

02:09:14.375 --> 02:09:16.791
-How's he doing this?
-His guys are holding back loans

02:09:16.875 --> 02:09:19.083
on Carlos's hotel in New Orleans,

02:09:19.166 --> 02:09:21.166
the add-on we're doing at Caesars.

02:09:25.666 --> 02:09:27.291
What's Fitz doing all this time?

02:09:28.208 --> 02:09:29.916
He's supposed to help with this shit.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.041
The money comes from the trustees.

02:09:32.625 --> 02:09:36.333
They sign off on it. They're supposed to
rubber stamp what Fitz says.

02:09:36.416 --> 02:09:37.583
Except Jimmy...

02:09:38.166 --> 02:09:40.958
has a couple of them
to stop rubber stamping.

02:09:42.583 --> 02:09:44.125
The son of a bitch.

02:09:44.625 --> 02:09:46.250
I thought we took care of that.

02:09:47.333 --> 02:09:48.833
He told somebody,

02:09:48.916 --> 02:09:50.875
once Fitz is out and he's in,

02:09:50.958 --> 02:09:52.916
he's gonna call in the old loans.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:54.250
Hotels,

02:09:54.333 --> 02:09:56.625
casinos, real estate, whatever it is.

02:09:56.708 --> 02:09:59.125
You don't have his money
and interest in two seconds,

02:09:59.208 --> 02:10:00.333
he's taking them over.

02:10:00.833 --> 02:10:02.083
We can't have that.

02:10:04.375 --> 02:10:05.208
He said that?

02:10:05.291 --> 02:10:06.291
He said that.

02:10:06.791 --> 02:10:08.208
You sure he said that, Tony?

02:10:08.291 --> 02:10:10.291
He said that. Everything

02:10:10.375 --> 02:10:11.791
I'm telling you, he said.

02:10:11.875 --> 02:10:13.916
Who does he think he is? Castro?

02:10:39.416 --> 02:10:40.958
You don't need money, do you?

02:10:41.041 --> 02:10:42.541
It's not about money.

02:10:42.625 --> 02:10:47.833
If it's not about money, then I don't
understand what all the talk is about.

02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:49.750
It's my union.

02:10:50.875 --> 02:10:52.625
Is that hard to understand?

02:10:52.708 --> 02:10:55.500
It's your union.
It'll always be your union.

02:10:55.583 --> 02:10:57.291
You could step down and still run it.

02:10:57.375 --> 02:10:59.291
You don't step down.

02:10:59.375 --> 02:11:01.458
You don't step down to run a union.

02:11:01.541 --> 02:11:03.208
You step down to go to your grave.

02:11:03.291 --> 02:11:04.416
Well, listen.

02:11:05.291 --> 02:11:08.458
I still think I can't help but think
I'm sorry,

02:11:08.541 --> 02:11:10.291
but is there another reason?

02:11:10.375 --> 02:11:13.500
This is my union! What do you mean
"another reason"?

02:11:14.541 --> 02:11:16.166
This is my union.

02:11:16.250 --> 02:11:17.916
Let's start with that,

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.750
and then try to understand things.

02:11:19.833 --> 02:11:21.791
Listen, some people,

02:11:22.375 --> 02:11:23.583
not me, but...

02:11:24.083 --> 02:11:25.250
some people,

02:11:25.833 --> 02:11:27.458
they're a little concerned.

02:11:28.125 --> 02:11:31.041
Some people, not me,
they think that you might...

02:11:31.666 --> 02:11:32.750
I might?

02:11:32.833 --> 02:11:36.958
You might be demonstrating a failure
to show appreciation.

02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:41.291
I'm not showing appreciation?

02:11:41.875 --> 02:11:43.916
According to, you know, some people.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.916
I went to school for five fucking years.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.291
Yes, you did.

02:11:48.375 --> 02:11:49.500
Five fucking years.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.041
I didn't name one fucking name.

02:11:53.125 --> 02:11:55.625
-You did the right thing.
-I did the right thing.

02:11:55.708 --> 02:11:57.500
I sat there with that

02:11:57.583 --> 02:12:01.750
whining cocksucker from New Jersey,
talking to me

02:12:01.833 --> 02:12:04.416
about his woes, his problems,

02:12:05.208 --> 02:12:08.000
and all I wanted to do
was finish my ice cream in peace.

02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:10.625
This cocksucker

02:12:10.708 --> 02:12:13.833
shows up at a meeting
15 minutes late,

02:12:14.875 --> 02:12:16.458
wearing fucking shorts!

02:12:17.625 --> 02:12:20.083
-Who wears shorts to a meeting?
-Nobody.

02:12:20.833 --> 02:12:21.791
Nobody.

02:12:22.458 --> 02:12:24.250
I'm not showing appreciation?

02:12:24.333 --> 02:12:25.333
It's not me.

02:12:25.833 --> 02:12:27.166
According to some people--

02:12:27.250 --> 02:12:29.500
I know it's not you. Some people.

02:12:29.583 --> 02:12:32.041
Some people say
I'm not showing appreciation?

02:12:32.125 --> 02:12:33.458
Well then, fuck them.

02:12:34.375 --> 02:12:35.791
I'm trying to help you.

02:12:35.875 --> 02:12:37.041
I know you are.

02:12:37.583 --> 02:12:39.583
But nobody threatens Hoffa.

02:13:01.083 --> 02:13:03.625
<i>He has done it as a driver.</i>

02:13:03.708 --> 02:13:04.875
<i>He has done it</i>

02:13:04.958 --> 02:13:06.833
as an organizer, and...

02:13:06.916 --> 02:13:09.916
I don't think many of you
know this, but Frank...

02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:11.583
holds a record.

02:13:12.958 --> 02:13:16.166
It's most arrests on the picket line.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.791
Twenty-six times...

02:13:20.458 --> 02:13:21.666
in 24 hours,

02:13:22.250 --> 02:13:23.666
beating my record.

02:13:26.541 --> 02:13:29.500
There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
There's no exaggeration.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.791
He is a union man...

02:13:33.375 --> 02:13:34.916
to his bones.

02:13:35.625 --> 02:13:37.291
Which side are you on?

02:13:37.375 --> 02:13:38.833
Your side!

02:13:38.916 --> 02:13:39.916
Whose side?

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Your side!

02:13:41.083 --> 02:13:42.125
My side.

02:13:42.208 --> 02:13:43.125
Your side.

02:13:43.208 --> 02:13:44.125
His side.

02:13:45.458 --> 02:13:46.541
There it is.

02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:50.541
It is an honor for me
to be here tonight

02:13:51.125 --> 02:13:52.416
to present this award

02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:54.666
to my dear friend,

02:13:55.250 --> 02:13:56.916
Mr. Frank Sheeran!

02:14:06.291 --> 02:14:08.125
Thank you, Jimmy, thank you so much.

02:14:09.583 --> 02:14:12.125
Thank you to my lovely wife Reenie,

02:14:12.208 --> 02:14:14.166
for being here with me.

02:14:14.666 --> 02:14:17.291
My lovely, sweet, adorable daughters,

02:14:17.375 --> 02:14:18.416
Maryanne,

02:14:18.916 --> 02:14:20.541
Dolores, Connie,

02:14:20.625 --> 02:14:22.916
Peggy, for putting up with me

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.541
for all these years.

02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:30.166
And, Jimmy, I can't tell you what this
means to me to get this honor from you.

02:14:31.458 --> 02:14:34.208
It's the highlight of my life.
Thank you very, very much.

02:14:34.791 --> 02:14:37.666
And this man, James Riddell Hoffa,

02:14:38.166 --> 02:14:40.541
is the guy that gets the job done.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.750
I'm behind you, Jimmy.

02:14:44.833 --> 02:14:45.958
All the way.

02:14:47.833 --> 02:14:51.458
In any case, from the deepest part
of my heart, I thank you all.

02:14:51.541 --> 02:14:53.333
I don't really deserve all this.

02:14:54.458 --> 02:14:57.125
But I have bursitis
and I don't deserve that either.

02:14:58.833 --> 02:15:01.208
Thank you all and thank you for coming.

02:15:13.625 --> 02:15:15.625
What happened to "Say cheese"?

02:16:32.665 --> 02:16:35.415
Only three people in the world
have one of these.

02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:37.790
And only one of them is Irish.

02:16:37.875 --> 02:16:39.250
I have one.

02:16:39.333 --> 02:16:40.790
Angelo has one.

02:16:43.208 --> 02:16:44.583
Now you have one.

02:16:49.165 --> 02:16:50.458
This is beautiful.

02:16:54.415 --> 02:16:57.333
I... I don... don't know
what to say, Russ. It's...

02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:00.125
Slip it on. See how it looks.

02:17:04.415 --> 02:17:05.915
-Feel good?
-Yeah.

02:17:07.958 --> 02:17:11.000
You know how strong I made you?
You know how strong?

02:17:12.708 --> 02:17:14.000
You're my kid.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.040
Nobody... Nobody can fuck with you.

02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:18.583
Nobody.

02:17:44.833 --> 02:17:45.833
Listen, Frank.

02:17:46.665 --> 02:17:49.958
Things have gotten out of hand
with our friend again.

02:17:50.790 --> 02:17:54.208
Some people are having serious problems
with him.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.833
And it's at a point where

02:17:57.915 --> 02:18:00.583
you're gonna have to talk to him
and tell him...

02:18:01.333 --> 02:18:02.875
it's what it is.

02:18:05.540 --> 02:18:06.750
What it is?

02:18:06.833 --> 02:18:08.708
Yes. It's what they want.

02:18:09.290 --> 02:18:10.583
It's where it's gotten.

02:18:12.125 --> 02:18:14.915
You're close to him.
Maybe he'll listen to you.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.458
I talked to him.
He's a tough guy to talk to.

02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:20.125
He has no choice.

02:18:20.208 --> 02:18:21.790
He has no choice.

02:18:22.375 --> 02:18:23.875
These are the higher-ups.

02:18:25.833 --> 02:18:28.040
Well, he's a higher-up, too. No?

02:18:29.083 --> 02:18:30.875
Not like this. You know that.

02:18:31.458 --> 02:18:32.625
Come on, Frank.

02:18:35.790 --> 02:18:39.833
If they can whack a president,
they can whack a president of the union.

02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:44.333
You know it and I know it.

02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:57.958
I talk, talk, talk to this guy.
He don't listen.

02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:00.540
But he's gotta listen now.
I gotta make him listen.

02:19:02.833 --> 02:19:06.208
That ain't right.
He's... he's a fucking knucklehead.

02:19:18.083 --> 02:19:19.708
I talked to Russ.

02:19:19.790 --> 02:19:21.040
He talked to Tony.

02:19:21.125 --> 02:19:22.375
He means what he's saying.

02:19:23.290 --> 02:19:24.665
Who? Russ?

02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:25.833
Tony.

02:19:27.333 --> 02:19:28.875
I mean what I'm saying.

02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:33.500
He can't seem to get that through
his fat fucking Sicilian head.

02:19:34.415 --> 02:19:35.333
Don't worry.

02:19:35.415 --> 02:19:36.750
What's the matter with you?

02:19:38.250 --> 02:19:39.708
-I'm concerned.
-Yeah, I know.

02:19:39.790 --> 02:19:41.333
What are you concerned about?

02:19:42.375 --> 02:19:44.750
-They should be concerned.
-They are.

02:19:45.333 --> 02:19:48.500
They're more than a little concerned.
There's widespread concern.

02:19:48.583 --> 02:19:49.833
It's a big problem.

02:19:51.250 --> 02:19:54.833
Tony told the old man
to tell me to tell you...

02:19:55.625 --> 02:19:56.791
"It's what it is".

02:20:01.041 --> 02:20:02.000
What it is?

02:20:02.083 --> 02:20:03.291
It's what it is.

02:20:07.083 --> 02:20:08.541
Please, listen to me.

02:20:10.583 --> 02:20:12.208
They wouldn't dare.

02:20:13.208 --> 02:20:14.333
They wouldn't dare.

02:20:14.958 --> 02:20:16.416
Hey, Frank, come on.

02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:18.000
Don't say they wouldn't dare.

02:20:18.083 --> 02:20:20.125
Don't... don't tell me that kinda...

02:20:20.208 --> 02:20:21.291
That's fairy tales.

02:20:21.375 --> 02:20:23.208
Don't say they wouldn't dare.

02:20:24.041 --> 02:20:26.291
If something funny happens to me,

02:20:28.166 --> 02:20:29.208
they're done.

02:20:29.291 --> 02:20:31.166
You understand that, and they know it.

02:20:31.250 --> 02:20:33.833
Because I got files. I got proof.

02:20:33.916 --> 02:20:34.958
I got records.

02:20:35.041 --> 02:20:38.166
Tapes. Any time I want, they'll be gone.

02:20:38.250 --> 02:20:41.916
These Guinea motherfuckers will spend
the rest of their lives in jail,

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:43.541
and they know it.

02:20:44.416 --> 02:20:45.750
They know it.

02:20:45.833 --> 02:20:47.541
That's what they're concerned about.

02:20:47.625 --> 02:20:49.083
I know things.

02:20:49.166 --> 02:20:52.125
I know things they don't know I know.

02:20:53.458 --> 02:20:55.041
You wanna take that chance?

02:20:55.125 --> 02:20:57.333
Why should I be taking a chance?

02:20:57.416 --> 02:20:58.875
They're saying this is it.

02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:01.083
They're saying this is it? It's it?

02:21:01.666 --> 02:21:03.500
Bullshit. Bullshit, Frank.

02:21:03.583 --> 02:21:05.083
I'm trying to tell you something.

02:21:05.166 --> 02:21:08.875
You're telling me they're threatening me
and I gotta do what they say.

02:21:08.958 --> 02:21:11.875
It's more than a threat.
It's the bottom line.

02:21:11.958 --> 02:21:12.916
The bottom line.

02:21:13.708 --> 02:21:14.958
It's what it is.

02:21:15.041 --> 02:21:17.875
They do something to me,
I do something to them.

02:21:18.625 --> 02:21:20.541
That's all I know. Nothing else.

02:21:23.458 --> 02:21:26.000
So what do I do? What do I tell McGee?

02:21:26.583 --> 02:21:28.083
That you're not gonna listen?

02:21:28.166 --> 02:21:29.875
He ain't used to people
not listening to him.

02:21:29.958 --> 02:21:31.041
Neither am I.

02:21:32.833 --> 02:21:34.000
Neither am I.

02:21:34.916 --> 02:21:36.125
Then I don't know what to do.

02:21:36.208 --> 02:21:38.875
You should get some bodies around
for protection.

02:21:39.375 --> 02:21:41.208
I'm not gonna go that route.

02:21:41.291 --> 02:21:42.791
Don't do this to me.

02:21:42.875 --> 02:21:45.083
What do you mean, bodies around me?

02:21:45.166 --> 02:21:47.833
You use bodies
then they go after your family.

02:21:47.916 --> 02:21:50.041
It doesn't matter. You worried?

02:21:50.125 --> 02:21:52.416
Get some bodies around you.
I tell you why.

02:21:53.625 --> 02:21:55.083
This could happen to you.

02:21:55.166 --> 02:21:57.208
They could come after you...

02:21:57.916 --> 02:21:59.208
since you're with me.

02:21:59.291 --> 02:22:00.166
No?

02:22:02.750 --> 02:22:03.833
I'm worried.

02:22:04.458 --> 02:22:06.583
Tell Russ I got nothing but respect
for him.

02:22:07.750 --> 02:22:09.291
We had a little trouble.

02:22:09.375 --> 02:22:12.541
We were talking and I got a little crazy.
You know me.

02:22:12.625 --> 02:22:13.583
I just blow.

02:22:13.666 --> 02:22:14.916
Sometimes.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:18.291
I just walked away. But I get that way.
I get abrupt.

02:22:18.375 --> 02:22:21.041
Maybe you could tell him
how much I respect him.

02:22:21.541 --> 02:22:23.500
I have nothing but respect for this guy.

02:22:24.041 --> 02:22:25.666
I would never hurt him,

02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:28.708
no matter what I do with files,
or with anything.

02:22:28.791 --> 02:22:30.166
But you should tell him.

02:22:30.750 --> 02:22:33.333
-Yourself.
-I'm not gonna tell him myself.

02:22:33.416 --> 02:22:35.750
-It would go a long way.
-He's your rabbi.

02:22:36.375 --> 02:22:38.208
Because of him you're here.

02:22:38.291 --> 02:22:39.250
You tell him.

02:22:40.083 --> 02:22:41.166
Listen to me.

02:22:41.250 --> 02:22:43.708
At the end, there's only one thing
that's real.

02:22:44.791 --> 02:22:46.541
This is my union.

02:22:48.375 --> 02:22:51.375
This is my union, Frank.

02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:55.541
Very simple when you say it that way.

02:23:01.125 --> 02:23:02.333
Peggy!

02:23:02.416 --> 02:23:03.875
Shall we dance?

02:23:04.458 --> 02:23:05.458
Excuse us.

02:23:37.291 --> 02:23:41.333
<i>A few hours outside Detroit, we figured
we'd spend the night,</i>

02:23:41.958 --> 02:23:43.708
<i>drive up in the morning.</i>

02:23:43.791 --> 02:23:45.291
<i>The wedding, that was the thing.</i>

02:23:46.333 --> 02:23:50.208
<i>Bill Bufalino was giving his daughter away
to a hell of a guy.</i>

02:23:50.291 --> 02:23:52.750
<i>Better than the bum she was with before.</i>

02:23:52.833 --> 02:23:54.500
<i>And that was all well and good.</i>

02:23:55.500 --> 02:23:58.666
<i>But the wedding was really
a peace mission.</i>

02:23:59.666 --> 02:24:01.041
<i>And that's what we were there for .</i>

02:24:01.125 --> 02:24:04.750
<i>And everybody kinda knew that
we were there to straighten it all out.</i>

02:24:06.791 --> 02:24:08.375
I'm driving up with the old man.

02:24:08.458 --> 02:24:11.125
<i>He hopes we can work everything out.</i>

02:24:11.208 --> 02:24:12.750
-What did he say?
<i>-He said he hopes</i>

02:24:12.833 --> 02:24:16.625
we can straighten it out. After the
wedding, we talk, we straighten it out.

02:24:17.541 --> 02:24:18.958
I'm not going to the wedding.

02:24:19.041 --> 02:24:21.125
Too many people I don't like
will be there, so,

02:24:21.208 --> 02:24:22.541
<i>I'm not going.</i>

02:24:22.625 --> 02:24:24.166
You're not going to the wedding?

02:24:24.250 --> 02:24:25.250
I'm not gonna be there.

02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:30.500
Well, we could
we can do it anywhere you want.

02:24:30.583 --> 02:24:32.458
We can do it at your house.

02:24:32.541 --> 02:24:34.041
We can do it anywhere you want.

02:24:34.125 --> 02:24:35.458
<i>Wherever you're comfortable.</i>

02:24:36.250 --> 02:24:37.291
The lake?

02:24:37.875 --> 02:24:39.458
You wanna do it at the lake?

02:24:40.750 --> 02:24:43.625
From day one, I wanted to work this out.

02:24:43.708 --> 02:24:45.041
I know.

02:24:45.125 --> 02:24:46.666
From day fucking one.

02:24:47.333 --> 02:24:49.250
Nobody knows better than me.

02:24:51.250 --> 02:24:52.583
Just you two, right?

02:24:52.666 --> 02:24:54.083
Not the Little Guy.

02:24:54.583 --> 02:24:56.291
-Of course, the Little Guy.
<i>-No.</i>

02:24:56.875 --> 02:24:58.416
I'm not doing it with him.

02:24:58.500 --> 02:24:59.833
There's no point just the three of us.

02:25:01.083 --> 02:25:03.333
Just the three of us. That's it.

02:25:03.416 --> 02:25:06.291
There's no point.
The Little Guy's gotta be with us.

02:25:06.375 --> 02:25:10.791
I'm not sitting down with that little
cocksucker again! I can't do it!

02:25:11.458 --> 02:25:14.458
-You have to sit down with him.
<i>-We don't gotta do anything.</i>

02:25:14.541 --> 02:25:18.583
This is a courtesy with these people.
A complete courtesy.

02:25:18.666 --> 02:25:19.500
<i>I understand.</i>

02:25:19.583 --> 02:25:21.166
You gotta move past that.

02:25:21.250 --> 02:25:24.958
I am past it. I'm never seeing
that motherfucker again.

02:25:25.041 --> 02:25:27.416
You gotta sit down. Everybody says so.

02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:31.958
There's no point. I don't wanna do it
and I'm not gonna do it.

02:25:32.041 --> 02:25:33.583
I'm gonna hang up now.

02:25:33.666 --> 02:25:35.583
Please. Understand this. Okay?

02:25:49.458 --> 02:25:52.041
-What did he say?
-He's thinking about it.

02:25:52.583 --> 02:25:53.666
Thinking about it?

02:26:01.708 --> 02:26:02.833
That's for you.

02:26:10.541 --> 02:26:11.416
Well, that's good.

02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:12.333
Okay.

02:26:25.541 --> 02:26:26.583
What time you got?

02:26:28.208 --> 02:26:29.166
About five.

02:26:32.916 --> 02:26:36.750
Give Jimmy a call.
He said he was gonna think about it.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Okay.

02:26:55.166 --> 02:26:56.625
So, when are you getting in?

02:26:56.708 --> 02:26:58.000
Tomorrow morning.

02:26:58.083 --> 02:26:59.958
<i>Oh, that's good. That's good 'cause...</i>

02:27:00.541 --> 02:27:02.875
I changed my mind
about the other thing.

02:27:04.333 --> 02:27:05.333
You did?

02:27:06.250 --> 02:27:09.083
I'm gonna meet with the Little Guy
tomorrow afternoon.

02:27:10.416 --> 02:27:12.916
-With the Lit... With the Little Guy?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:15.833
Tony Jack set it up. I like Jack.

02:27:15.916 --> 02:27:17.750
<i>Jack's good. I met with him a few times</i>

02:27:17.833 --> 02:27:19.625
after that Miami fiasco.

02:27:20.208 --> 02:27:21.916
With the Little Guy. Where?

02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:23.958
<i>Same place as before.</i>

02:27:24.541 --> 02:27:25.958
You know where it is.

02:27:26.041 --> 02:27:27.000
In public.

02:27:28.750 --> 02:27:30.791
You know Tony Jack is Pro's cousin?

02:27:31.291 --> 02:27:34.458
Yeah. So? They're all fucking cousins.
What're you gonna do?

02:27:35.375 --> 02:27:37.166
Jimmy, I think I should be there.

02:27:37.250 --> 02:27:40.500
Yeah, I want you there.
That's why I asked when you're coming in.

02:27:41.166 --> 02:27:43.291
-What time's the meeting?
<i>-Two-thirty.</i>

02:27:43.375 --> 02:27:45.833
And that cocksucker better not be late.

02:27:45.916 --> 02:27:47.916
Or wearing those fucking shorts.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.083
<i>I'm gonna get there at two, so,</i>

02:27:50.166 --> 02:27:52.541
-you should get there at two.
<i>-I'll be there.</i>

02:27:52.625 --> 02:27:54.041
Oh, good. Good.

02:27:55.083 --> 02:27:56.291
I'll see you at two.

02:27:59.291 --> 02:28:00.333
See you at two.

02:28:06.875 --> 02:28:07.958
What did he say?

02:28:08.833 --> 02:28:10.125
He's gonna meet with Pro.

02:28:12.291 --> 02:28:13.625
Tony Jack set it up.

02:28:14.125 --> 02:28:15.333
Very good.

02:28:33.166 --> 02:28:34.333
We're starving.

02:28:42.083 --> 02:28:45.833
This is the best move we've made
getting this vinegar from Angelo's guy.

02:28:48.083 --> 02:28:49.500
The Italian olive oil,

02:28:49.583 --> 02:28:52.000
we got from that other mooch
wasn't bad, either.

02:28:54.041 --> 02:28:56.416
Catania olives, what better.

02:28:56.500 --> 02:28:57.333
The best.

02:29:02.125 --> 02:29:03.833
There's been a change.

02:29:04.416 --> 02:29:05.541
Instead of...

02:29:07.291 --> 02:29:11.208
going up early, we're gonna hang around
tomorrow morning and then drive up.

02:29:11.958 --> 02:29:14.291
But I t... told Jimmy that we were gonna

02:29:14.375 --> 02:29:15.708
be up in the morning.

02:29:17.291 --> 02:29:20.125
I told... I told Jimmy
we'd be up in the morning.

02:29:20.625 --> 02:29:22.166
I know. I know.

02:29:24.250 --> 02:29:27.875
Th... that I would be there
for th... that meeting with Pro.

02:29:27.958 --> 02:29:29.208
What?

02:29:29.291 --> 02:29:31.625
Th... that meeting with Pro.

02:29:31.708 --> 02:29:33.000
I know. I know.

02:29:37.166 --> 02:29:39.500
But what I... I... What am I gonna do?

02:29:41.791 --> 02:29:45.000
We gotta go there. I mean,
I gotta go. I told him I'd be there.

02:29:50.416 --> 02:29:52.500
We did all we could for the man.

02:30:04.166 --> 02:30:05.250
Don't call him.

02:30:42.250 --> 02:30:43.291
Good morning.

02:30:46.916 --> 02:30:48.458
Want some coffee?

02:30:48.541 --> 02:30:49.750
No, I got it here.

02:30:51.541 --> 02:30:53.541
-How'd ya sleep?
-Good. You?

02:30:55.375 --> 02:30:56.375
All right.

02:31:00.500 --> 02:31:02.291
Want Total or corn flakes?

02:31:03.583 --> 02:31:04.458
Total.

02:31:20.875 --> 02:31:23.208
We're going up to Port Clinton today.

02:31:28.875 --> 02:31:30.625
I thought we were staying here.

02:31:31.666 --> 02:31:33.416
No, the girls are staying here.

02:31:34.250 --> 02:31:36.125
You and me, we're going up.

02:31:37.666 --> 02:31:39.875
We'll be back three hours tops.

02:31:43.833 --> 02:31:45.833
What's in Port Clinton?

02:31:46.416 --> 02:31:47.458
A plane.

02:31:51.208 --> 02:31:52.750
A plane? To where?

02:31:53.416 --> 02:31:54.458
Detroit.

02:32:01.958 --> 02:32:03.541
We're going to Detroit now?

02:32:04.333 --> 02:32:06.708
No, you're going to Detroit.

02:32:09.208 --> 02:32:10.583
And when you come back,

02:32:11.083 --> 02:32:12.291
me and you,

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:16.166
together with the girls,
we take a nice slow drive up.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:18.833
With cigarette breaks.

02:32:32.041 --> 02:32:34.125
I had to put you into this thing...

02:32:34.916 --> 02:32:37.000
or you would never let it happen.

02:32:37.875 --> 02:32:39.791
I know you wouldn't.

02:32:45.041 --> 02:32:46.583
But it's gonna happen.

02:32:49.166 --> 02:32:50.291
Either way,

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.166
he's going.

02:32:58.250 --> 02:33:00.666
I know how you feel, Frank. Trust me.

02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:02.333
I know how you feel.

02:33:03.958 --> 02:33:07.916
We tried everything to help him.
You know that.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.416
You tried.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:13.625
He brought this on himself.

02:33:15.875 --> 02:33:17.958
And it's landing on us.

02:33:21.541 --> 02:33:23.166
They only agreed to this,

02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:26.333
out of respect to me.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.041
But you and Reenie will be okay...

02:33:31.791 --> 02:33:33.166
'cause you're with me.

02:33:38.125 --> 02:33:39.375
You're with me.

02:34:18.583 --> 02:34:19.916
Give me your glasses.

02:38:52.625 --> 02:38:54.083
Chuckie's late.

02:39:47.833 --> 02:39:48.875
That him?

02:40:02.666 --> 02:40:03.833
I'm Sally.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.208
Let's go. Your father'll yell at me
for being late.

02:40:11.291 --> 02:40:12.708
Frank, you take the front.

02:40:13.708 --> 02:40:14.833
What the fuck is this?

02:40:16.291 --> 02:40:17.208
It's wet.

02:40:17.833 --> 02:40:19.958
I had a frozen fish I had to...

02:40:20.458 --> 02:40:22.125
deliver for a friend of mine.

02:40:22.708 --> 02:40:24.000
A fish?

02:40:24.083 --> 02:40:25.541
The seat is wet from a fish?

02:40:25.625 --> 02:40:27.333
What do you want me to do about it now?

02:40:27.416 --> 02:40:28.250
I'll sit in back.

02:40:28.333 --> 02:40:29.708
No, you sit in the front.

02:40:31.125 --> 02:40:33.000
I'll sit here. You take the front.

02:40:33.666 --> 02:40:35.125
I'll sit there.

02:40:38.291 --> 02:40:40.333
I'm not sitting there. I'm sitting there.

02:40:42.791 --> 02:40:43.958
Sit where you want.

02:40:46.750 --> 02:40:48.458
You want a newspaper, Frank?

02:40:48.541 --> 02:40:49.833
Let's go. We gotta hurry.

02:41:03.916 --> 02:41:05.083
What kind of fish?

02:41:07.291 --> 02:41:08.125
What?

02:41:10.625 --> 02:41:12.083
What kind of fish?

02:41:13.958 --> 02:41:16.833
I don't know. The kind you eat. A fish.

02:41:17.916 --> 02:41:19.375
You don't know what kind?

02:41:21.291 --> 02:41:22.750
No. I don't.

02:41:23.875 --> 02:41:25.000
Where did you get it?

02:41:26.125 --> 02:41:28.208
What the fuck. At a fish place.

02:41:30.333 --> 02:41:33.708
Did ya just go in there and say,
"Gimme a fish?"

02:41:34.791 --> 02:41:36.125
Pretty much. Yeah.

02:41:37.708 --> 02:41:40.708
You didn't say, you wanna salmon,
you wanna...

02:41:40.791 --> 02:41:42.041
haddock, you wanna a...

02:41:42.750 --> 02:41:43.791
a fucking cod?

02:41:43.875 --> 02:41:46.416
What the fuck does it matter
what kind of fish it was?

02:41:47.041 --> 02:41:50.625
-Why are you so concerned?
-I'm just trying to understand how...

02:41:53.291 --> 02:41:56.083
how you can buy a fish
and not know what kind it was.

02:41:58.416 --> 02:42:00.958
There was a fish waiting for me there.

02:42:04.041 --> 02:42:07.208
I didn't ask what kind it was. I'm sorry.

02:42:10.916 --> 02:42:13.125
So your friend
had already ordered this fish.

02:42:20.166 --> 02:42:23.125
I wanna be able to explain this
if somebody asks me.

02:42:44.375 --> 02:42:45.250
Dad.

02:42:47.208 --> 02:42:48.125
Chuckie.

02:42:48.208 --> 02:42:50.416
-Sorry I'm late. I had to--
-Late?

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.666
What are you even doing here?

02:42:52.750 --> 02:42:53.791
Who invited you?

02:42:57.125 --> 02:42:58.791
Who the fuck are you?

02:42:58.875 --> 02:43:00.291
I'm with Pro.

02:43:00.375 --> 02:43:01.791
You're with Pro?

02:43:01.875 --> 02:43:04.416
The cocksucker who just stood me up?

02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:06.750
I wait only ten minutes for someone.

02:43:06.833 --> 02:43:07.916
He's at the house.

02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:09.625
What house?

02:43:09.708 --> 02:43:10.958
With Russ.

02:43:11.625 --> 02:43:13.125
Russ? What the fuck is...

02:43:13.208 --> 02:43:14.375
Look who's here.

02:43:16.458 --> 02:43:18.625
What the fuck is going on?

02:43:18.708 --> 02:43:20.291
I was waiting for you.

02:43:20.375 --> 02:43:22.166
You were supposed to show at two.

02:43:22.250 --> 02:43:25.166
I'm sorry. McGee decided to come.

02:43:25.250 --> 02:43:27.333
But he didn't wanna come here.

02:43:27.416 --> 02:43:28.458
He's at the house.

02:43:28.541 --> 02:43:29.833
McGee's in Detroit?

02:43:30.875 --> 02:43:32.208
He decided to come.

02:43:34.791 --> 02:43:36.916
To help straighten this all out.

02:43:38.458 --> 02:43:39.458
The house?

02:43:45.125 --> 02:43:46.750
We'll bring you back after.

02:44:13.250 --> 02:44:14.916
There was a fish in here, but...

02:44:15.416 --> 02:44:16.708
we cleaned it up.

02:44:16.791 --> 02:44:17.625
A fish?

02:44:19.083 --> 02:44:22.666
Chuckie had a fucking fish in here.
Didn't know what kind.

02:44:22.750 --> 02:44:24.208
It's okay. I wiped it up.

02:44:24.291 --> 02:44:26.875
-I got the handkerchief here.
-I can smell it.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:29.833
You had a fish in your car?

02:44:29.916 --> 02:44:31.416
For Bobby Holmes.

02:44:31.500 --> 02:44:33.000
Bobby likes fish.

02:44:33.583 --> 02:44:35.041
We cleaned it up, Jimmy.

02:44:35.125 --> 02:44:36.416
You cleaned it up?

02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:37.708
You cleaned it up?

02:44:38.208 --> 02:44:40.000
What the fuck you know about fish?

02:44:40.500 --> 02:44:42.500
You ever catch a fucking fish?

02:44:43.375 --> 02:44:44.208
No.

02:44:44.291 --> 02:44:45.958
Then you don't know.

02:44:47.458 --> 02:44:51.583
Listen. Never put a fish in your car.
You never get the smell out.

02:44:52.166 --> 02:44:54.125
Unless you pack it tight.

02:44:54.208 --> 02:44:55.125
I know.

02:44:55.208 --> 02:44:56.916
You know? Remember that.

02:44:58.041 --> 02:44:59.458
It'll help you in life.

02:45:04.916 --> 02:45:07.583
You couldn't come at two
and tell me this?

02:45:07.666 --> 02:45:10.708
I was waiting there forty minutes
like a fuckin' moron.

02:45:10.791 --> 02:45:13.041
I'm sorry. I came as soon as I got here.

02:45:13.125 --> 02:45:15.083
You got in this morning.

02:45:15.166 --> 02:45:19.125
Russell had business in Port Clinton.
I had to wait for him.

02:45:19.208 --> 02:45:20.833
He reminded me. I forgot.

02:45:20.916 --> 02:45:24.625
As soon as we got here,
I came right here to see you.

02:45:24.708 --> 02:45:26.833
All due respect to Russ, you know,

02:45:27.666 --> 02:45:30.250
but somebody should have come tell me.

02:45:30.750 --> 02:45:34.541
Just come tell me it's 2:30, 2:40,
at the very least.

02:45:34.625 --> 02:45:35.625
Not incorrect.

02:45:35.708 --> 02:45:39.875
And who the fuck is Pro?
Sending a fucking errand boy.

02:45:39.958 --> 02:45:41.000
He ain't stayin'.

02:45:41.083 --> 02:45:44.291
That's not the point he's staying
or not staying.

02:45:44.375 --> 02:45:45.875
The point is Pro sent him.

02:45:47.333 --> 02:45:50.208
He should've picked me up himself.
That's the point.

02:45:53.541 --> 02:45:55.458
Can you see out of those glasses?

02:45:56.833 --> 02:45:58.416
I can't see a fucking thing.

02:45:58.916 --> 02:46:01.208
That's good. I'm glad you're not driving.

02:46:09.791 --> 02:46:11.291
Yeah, it's right... It's right up...

02:46:11.958 --> 02:46:15.041
It's right up here. Right... right up...
The building with the staircase.

02:46:17.333 --> 02:46:18.541
You got your friend with you?

02:46:21.375 --> 02:46:23.375
You never know with this cocksucker,

02:46:23.458 --> 02:46:24.916
with or without Russ there.

02:47:04.666 --> 02:47:06.416
Let's get outta here. Come on.

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.666
<i>James Hoffa, former president
of the Teamsters Union,</i>

02:49:44.750 --> 02:49:49.166
<i>disappeared on Wednesday.
No trace of him has been found.</i>

02:49:49.250 --> 02:49:53.000
<i>Hoffa spent four years in prison,
and made no bones about his intention</i>

02:49:53.083 --> 02:49:56.708
<i>to get the presidency back
from his successor Frank Fitzsimmons.</i>

02:49:59.208 --> 02:50:00.166
Still nothing?

02:50:01.250 --> 02:50:02.583
<i>Young Fitzsimmons' car</i>

02:50:02.666 --> 02:50:04.458
<i>was bombed. He was not in it.</i>

02:50:04.541 --> 02:50:07.791
<i>But there is bad blood
in the Detroit Local.</i>

02:50:07.875 --> 02:50:10.750
<i>Hoffa disappeared Wednesday afternoon.</i>

02:50:10.833 --> 02:50:14.333
<i>Now, more than 48 hours later,
there's no word</i>

02:50:14.416 --> 02:50:15.791
<i>on what happened to Hoffa.</i>

02:50:15.875 --> 02:50:18.125
<i>Police are extremely concerned.</i>

02:50:18.208 --> 02:50:20.833
<i>Authorities are trying to find
whom Hoffa</i>

02:50:20.916 --> 02:50:25.250
<i>was supposed to meet outside the Red
Fox restaurant where he was last seen.</i>

02:50:25.833 --> 02:50:29.541
<i>Police think it could have been
Anthony Giacalone,</i>

02:50:29.625 --> 02:50:32.125
<i>a big man in the Detroit Mafia.</i>

02:50:32.208 --> 02:50:36.583
<i>Hoffa's son James tried to contact
Giacalone today, but didn't succeed.</i>

02:50:41.041 --> 02:50:42.416
I should call Jo.

02:50:44.583 --> 02:50:46.333
You haven't called Jo yet?

02:50:53.083 --> 02:50:53.958
Why?

02:50:54.833 --> 02:50:55.708
What?

02:50:56.833 --> 02:50:57.958
Why?

02:50:59.416 --> 02:51:00.500
Why what?

02:51:02.500 --> 02:51:04.041
Why haven't you called Jo?

02:51:12.416 --> 02:51:13.833
I'm gonna call her now.

02:51:15.333 --> 02:51:19.583
<i>Do you think the abduction had anything
to do with the recent conflicts</i>

02:51:19.666 --> 02:51:21.625
<i>within Local 299, his own Local?</i>

02:51:21.708 --> 02:51:25.916
<i>I think the union politics certainly
has to be investigated.</i>

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:30.166
<i>One high official of the Teamsters
says he fears the worst,</i>

02:51:30.250 --> 02:51:32.458
<i>that Hoffa may have been killed.</i>

02:51:33.166 --> 02:51:36.083
<i>Robert Hager, NBC News,
Bloomfield, Michigan.</i>

02:51:45.208 --> 02:51:46.625
<i>She stopped talking to me</i>

02:51:46.708 --> 02:51:47.875
that day.

02:51:47.958 --> 02:51:50.458
August 3, 1975.

02:51:52.208 --> 02:51:54.041
She's got a good job now

02:51:54.125 --> 02:51:56.750
and lives just outside Philly.

02:51:57.833 --> 02:51:59.291
But my daughter...

02:52:00.208 --> 02:52:01.250
Peggy...

02:52:02.250 --> 02:52:03.333
disappeared...

02:52:04.916 --> 02:52:06.500
from my life that day.

02:52:13.541 --> 02:52:14.375
Hello.

02:52:15.333 --> 02:52:17.000
Jo?

02:52:20.750 --> 02:52:21.791
Yeah, Frank.

02:52:28.875 --> 02:52:31.208
<i>Do you think... Do you think he's alive?</i>

02:52:34.041 --> 02:52:35.166
He's gotta be.

02:52:36.708 --> 02:52:40.708
You know, you gotta think positively.
It's just, it ain't that long.

02:52:40.791 --> 02:52:42.000
<i>But do you...</i>

02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:43.875
<i>do you know he's okay?</i>

02:52:43.958 --> 02:52:46.750
No, no, no, I mean, you know me, I...

02:52:46.833 --> 02:52:49.875
Maybe he did something
like the Joe Bananas thing...

02:52:50.625 --> 02:52:53.250
and had himself kidnapped, and then...

02:52:53.875 --> 02:52:56.583
came back. But he wasn't hurt,
nothing happened.

02:52:57.791 --> 02:53:01.208
Maybe he just... he... he wanted to
clear his head a bit.

02:53:01.291 --> 02:53:03.083
Ya gotta think that it's gonna be...

02:53:03.916 --> 02:53:05.333
it's gonna be okay.

02:53:06.125 --> 02:53:07.708
It's gonna be okay.

02:53:12.083 --> 02:53:14.791
If you need anything, I'm here for you.

02:53:14.875 --> 02:53:16.750
Anything. Anything.

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:19.875
<i>Can you call me again?</i>

02:53:19.958 --> 02:53:22.041
Yeah, I'll call... I'll call you.

02:53:23.708 --> 02:53:25.166
Yeah, I'll... I'll call you.

02:53:26.416 --> 02:53:28.125
I'll check in with you tomorrow.

02:53:28.708 --> 02:53:30.416
<i>Yes, call me tomorrow.</i>

02:53:30.500 --> 02:53:32.708
I'll call in the morning, okay?

02:53:32.791 --> 02:53:33.625
<i>Promise?</i>

02:53:33.708 --> 02:53:35.000
Don't worry. Be strong.

02:53:35.583 --> 02:53:36.666
Be positive.

02:53:37.958 --> 02:53:40.041
Okay, okay.

02:53:42.666 --> 02:53:44.583
Talk to ya a little later. Bye.

02:54:45.208 --> 02:54:47.875
It was no more complicated than that.

02:54:50.375 --> 02:54:51.291
Mr. Sheeran,

02:54:51.958 --> 02:54:54.125
do you know who, if anyone,

02:54:54.208 --> 02:54:57.041
was behind the disappearance
of James Hoffa?

02:54:57.125 --> 02:55:00.541
<i>Everybody who ever had anything to do
with Jimmy</i>

02:55:00.625 --> 02:55:02.375
<i>was hauled in and questioned.</i>

02:55:02.458 --> 02:55:05.666
I respectfully decline
to answer that question

02:55:05.750 --> 02:55:08.208
on the grounds that it might
incriminate me.

02:55:08.291 --> 02:55:09.583
Let me ask you this:

02:55:10.208 --> 02:55:11.583
What color is my pen?

02:55:14.166 --> 02:55:16.083
<i>And everybody took the Fifth.</i>

02:55:16.166 --> 02:55:17.208
<i>In that situation,</i>

02:55:17.791 --> 02:55:19.416
<i>that's what you do.</i>

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:24.458
<i>Still, everybody got convicted
of one thing or another,</i>

02:55:24.541 --> 02:55:25.750
<i>but not that.</i>

02:55:25.833 --> 02:55:27.083
<i>Not about Jimmy.</i>

02:55:27.166 --> 02:55:30.208
<i>Nobody, as you know, even went to jail
for that.</i>

02:55:30.291 --> 02:55:32.833
<i>And nobody talked, which is unusual.</i>

02:55:32.916 --> 02:55:34.916
<i>Usually, three people can keep a secret</i>

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:36.750
<i>only when two of them are dead.</i>

02:55:38.791 --> 02:55:41.291
<i>Bruno Denzetta and Marco Rossi</i>

02:55:41.375 --> 02:55:44.916
<i>got twenty years each for shaking down
a trucking company.</i>

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:47.583
<i>Pro was convicted with them,</i>

02:55:47.666 --> 02:55:51.666
<i>but he was already back in school
for that other matter.</i>

02:55:51.750 --> 02:55:54.500
<i>That union Treasurer
Tony Three Fingers</i>

02:55:54.583 --> 02:55:55.875
<i>who got more votes than Pro.</i>

02:55:56.708 --> 02:55:58.083
<i>They got him on that.</i>

02:55:58.166 --> 02:56:01.083
<i>Sally Bugs, you know, he did that one.</i>

02:56:07.291 --> 02:56:10.750
<i>One day, Bugs was seen
walking into the Federal building.</i>

02:56:12.166 --> 02:56:13.833
<i>What he did ain't no crime.</i>

02:56:14.416 --> 02:56:16.791
A lot of people get called in for things.

02:56:17.291 --> 02:56:19.125
But Sally knows better.

02:56:19.625 --> 02:56:21.875
Why didn't he say anything to anybody?

02:56:23.166 --> 02:56:24.958
He didn't tell anybody one word.

02:56:25.958 --> 02:56:27.083
Not one word.

02:56:28.291 --> 02:56:29.750
One thing for sure,

02:56:30.750 --> 02:56:32.875
he didn't go there for fucking lunch.

02:56:46.041 --> 02:56:46.875
Sally.

02:56:48.500 --> 02:56:49.583
Hey, Irish.

02:57:01.916 --> 02:57:04.291
<i>Turns out Sally did tell somebody</i>

02:57:04.375 --> 02:57:07.333
<i>he was going there.
They just forgot to tell somebody else.</i>

02:57:07.416 --> 02:57:09.500
<i>So, it was a bad hit.</i>

02:57:12.333 --> 02:57:16.166
<i>Jimmy's son Chuckie, his foster son,
was in the thing, too,</i>

02:57:16.250 --> 02:57:17.541
<i>but he didn't know it.</i>

02:57:18.583 --> 02:57:22.416
<i>All Chuckie knew was he was pickin' up
one of Pro's guys and me,</i>

02:57:22.500 --> 02:57:26.375
<i>and we was gonna pick up his dad
at the Red Fox for a meetin'.</i>

02:57:27.125 --> 02:57:30.708
<i>Well, he was in it, yeah,
you could say that, but stupidly.</i>

02:57:31.625 --> 02:57:36.208
<i>I... I always felt sorry for Chuckie
in this whole thing. And I... I still do.</i>

02:57:36.291 --> 02:57:39.666
<i>And the Feds gave him ten months for
some bullshit thing about a car</i>

02:57:39.750 --> 02:57:41.750
<i>and a... who knows what the fuck.</i>

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:47.166
<i>Fat Tony Salerno,
they got on an income tax thing.</i>

02:57:47.958 --> 02:57:48.958
<i>A little after,</i>

02:57:49.041 --> 02:57:51.833
<i>he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.</i>

02:57:55.500 --> 02:57:58.500
There's a... a pork store up in...

02:58:00.625 --> 02:58:02.458
northern California.

02:58:03.833 --> 02:58:04.958
Right around...

02:58:06.250 --> 02:58:08.625
Walnut Creek.
You're from up there, ain't you?

02:58:09.250 --> 02:58:10.125
Yeah.

02:58:10.750 --> 02:58:12.958
Maybe you know the guy that runs it.

02:58:13.625 --> 02:58:15.958
Actually, I'm looking for
a little favor...

02:58:16.458 --> 02:58:18.083
for him, not for me.

02:58:19.125 --> 02:58:22.791
But if you can get him a ticket,
like, to Australia...

02:58:24.291 --> 02:58:25.625
You know what I mean.

02:58:28.166 --> 02:58:29.041
Yeah.

02:58:30.750 --> 02:58:32.791
Want to help him get down there?

02:58:38.291 --> 02:58:39.458
Y... Yeah.

02:58:39.541 --> 02:58:41.208
<i>Now Russell got pinched</i>

02:58:41.291 --> 02:58:44.208
<i>for telling Jimmy The Weasel
to strangle Jack Napoli</i>

02:58:44.291 --> 02:58:48.458
<i>over a beef about 25 grand of jewelry
that Jack took on credit</i>

02:58:48.541 --> 02:58:51.250
<i>from Russell
and then he never paid for.</i>

02:58:51.333 --> 02:58:53.958
<i>Now, with Russ, you don't do that.</i>

02:58:55.083 --> 02:58:58.208
<i>So, only thing is, The Weasel,
he flipped.</i>

02:58:58.291 --> 02:58:59.541
<i>He had a wire on him.</i>

02:59:00.041 --> 02:59:02.791
<i>They called it
"conspiracy to kill a witness".</i>

02:59:02.875 --> 02:59:06.416
<i>It was obvious to everybody else that
Napoli was clearly in the wrong.</i>

02:59:06.500 --> 02:59:08.208
<i>How could you not see that?</i>

02:59:08.291 --> 02:59:10.041
<i>He set him up. It was entrapment.</i>

02:59:10.125 --> 02:59:11.208
<i>What else could you call it?</i>

02:59:11.708 --> 02:59:14.833
<i>But that's another thing
I don't wanna get into now.</i>

02:59:16.791 --> 02:59:19.500
<i>They charged me up with bribery
and labor racketeering</i>

02:59:19.583 --> 02:59:21.708
<i>and some other bullshit things.</i>

02:59:25.708 --> 02:59:30.000
Did Mr. Boffa give you and your wife
luxury vehicles?

02:59:31.416 --> 02:59:33.291
I've worked for 44 years.

02:59:33.375 --> 02:59:37.708
I never took one dime illegal off Boffa
or nobody else.

02:59:37.791 --> 02:59:39.208
You can think what you want.

02:59:40.291 --> 02:59:43.291
<i>All they got me for
was blowing up a crane company</i>

02:59:43.375 --> 02:59:46.541
<i>that fired two of my shop stewards
for no good reason.</i>

02:59:49.125 --> 02:59:50.791
<i>An... and my Lincoln.</i>

02:59:51.500 --> 02:59:54.083
<i>I bought that car from Eugene Boffa.</i>

02:59:55.083 --> 02:59:57.583
<i>He leased truck drivers
to freight companies,</i>

02:59:57.666 --> 03:00:00.333
<i>and then paid them
substandard wages.</i>

03:00:02.458 --> 03:00:06.000
<i>They said I paid a lot less for the car
than what it was worth.</i>

03:00:06.708 --> 03:00:08.625
<i>They said the car was a bribe.</i>

03:00:14.916 --> 03:00:16.833
<i>I... I... I loved that car.</i>

03:00:17.500 --> 03:00:22.250
<i>But it wasn't worth the 18 years
they gave me for it. That's for sure.</i>

03:00:27.416 --> 03:00:29.791
<i>Russell, he had a stroke.</i>

03:00:29.875 --> 03:00:33.541
<i>Fat Tony,
he couldn't control his urine no more.</i>

03:00:33.625 --> 03:00:35.333
<i>A... and my arthritis,</i>

03:00:35.416 --> 03:00:40.625
<i>that started in the foxholes of Anzio,
was eatin' at my lower back,</i>

03:00:40.708 --> 03:00:43.208
<i>and I couldn't feel much in my feet.</i>

03:00:43.833 --> 03:00:45.250
<i>I needed a cane.</i>

03:00:45.333 --> 03:00:47.958
<i>But they won't give you a cane
in the can,</i>

03:00:48.041 --> 03:00:50.666
<i>since you could use it as a weapon.</i>

03:00:50.750 --> 03:00:53.541
<i>The medicine Neurontin
helped me a little bit,</i>

03:00:53.625 --> 03:00:56.000
<i>but it made you loopy.</i>

03:00:57.375 --> 03:00:58.375
He's got it!

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:03.083
<i>We were all falling apart
in the freezing fucking cold.</i>

03:01:03.666 --> 03:01:04.833
You getting scared?

03:01:04.916 --> 03:01:07.833
Yeah, you stay here another ten years,
you'll beat me.

03:01:17.166 --> 03:01:18.666
Is this the good grape juice?

03:01:31.250 --> 03:01:32.750
I can't eat it.

03:01:33.375 --> 03:01:34.666
I got no teeth.

03:01:35.375 --> 03:01:36.416
Put a little piece.

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:38.333
Just a little piece.

03:02:00.958 --> 03:02:02.541
Jimmy was a good man.

03:02:03.291 --> 03:02:05.125
He had a nice family, too.

03:02:09.416 --> 03:02:10.583
I know.

03:02:12.208 --> 03:02:14.583
I never wanted it to go that far.

03:02:23.875 --> 03:02:26.583
I picked us over him.

03:02:27.458 --> 03:02:28.375
Fuck 'em.

03:02:29.625 --> 03:02:30.500
Fuck 'em.

03:02:32.666 --> 03:02:33.583
Fuck 'em.

03:03:01.041 --> 03:03:02.208
Where you goin?

03:03:02.916 --> 03:03:05.333
-Where you goin'?
-To church.

03:03:07.416 --> 03:03:09.125
Don't laugh, you'll see.

03:03:09.208 --> 03:03:10.333
Don't laugh.

03:03:10.833 --> 03:03:11.833
You'll see.

03:03:19.833 --> 03:03:21.708
<i>Russell went to church.</i>

03:03:23.750 --> 03:03:26.833
<i>Then he went to the prison hospital.</i>

03:03:30.125 --> 03:03:32.541
<i>And then he went to the graveyard.</i>

03:03:35.208 --> 03:03:37.041
Lord Jesus Christ...

03:03:38.458 --> 03:03:40.375
<i>I got out that October.</i>

03:03:40.458 --> 03:03:42.416
<i>Reenie died in December.</i>

03:03:42.916 --> 03:03:45.416
<i>On December 23, to be exact.</i>

03:03:46.041 --> 03:03:47.125
<i>Lung cancer.</i>

03:03:47.625 --> 03:03:48.875
<i>No surprise.</i>

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.958
Grant that our sister
may sleep here in peace

03:03:56.041 --> 03:03:58.208
until you awaken her to glory.

03:03:59.083 --> 03:04:01.708
For you are the resurrection and the life.

03:04:01.791 --> 03:04:04.291
And then she will see you face-to-face,

03:04:04.375 --> 03:04:06.416
and in your light will see light,

03:04:06.916 --> 03:04:08.916
and know the splendor of God,

03:04:09.416 --> 03:04:11.958
for ever and ever. Amen.

03:05:50.750 --> 03:05:53.500
<i>Much to the frustration
of some policy makers,</i>

03:05:53.583 --> 03:05:56.416
<i>NATO military leaders will not risk</i>

03:05:56.500 --> 03:06:00.000
<i>low flying attacks on Serb troops
in Kosovo.</i>

03:06:01.166 --> 03:06:05.208
<i>It could days more of systematic
bombing, especially since</i>

03:06:05.291 --> 03:06:08.958
<i>the Serbs have hidden so many
of their anti-aircraft missiles,</i>

03:06:09.041 --> 03:06:11.333
<i>in essence, daring NATO to fly low.</i>

03:06:34.708 --> 03:06:37.000
You go... You go there. Yeah, yeah.

03:06:49.125 --> 03:06:51.833
Peggy. I just want to talk.

03:07:15.500 --> 03:07:17.250
She walked away.

03:07:17.958 --> 03:07:20.541
I know she's mad at me, but I... I want...

03:07:20.625 --> 03:07:23.458
Call her. Call her.
I just want to talk to her.

03:07:24.916 --> 03:07:26.708
Talk to her and tell her what?

03:07:28.375 --> 03:07:30.875
I just want to say I'm sorry. That's all.

03:07:32.333 --> 03:07:33.208
For?

03:07:37.791 --> 03:07:40.875
I know I wasn't a... a good dad.
I know that.

03:07:40.958 --> 03:07:43.458
I was just trying to protect her.

03:07:43.541 --> 03:07:46.875
Protect all of youse.
That's what I was doing.

03:07:48.458 --> 03:07:49.500
From what?

03:07:50.500 --> 03:07:51.666
Well, everything.

03:07:53.625 --> 03:07:56.291
You... youse had a...
a sheltered life,

03:07:56.375 --> 03:07:58.750
in a way, because you didn't see
what I see,

03:07:58.833 --> 03:08:00.458
and what I've been through.

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:04.958
There's a lot of bad people out there.

03:08:05.041 --> 03:08:06.541
What else am I gonna do?

03:08:07.500 --> 03:08:10.291
Daddy, you have no idea
what it was like for us.

03:08:11.750 --> 03:08:15.208
We couldn't go to you with a problem
because of what you would do.

03:08:15.291 --> 03:08:17.458
We couldn't come to you for protection

03:08:17.541 --> 03:08:19.833
because of the terrible things
you would do.

03:08:22.583 --> 03:08:26.583
I was just... I was... I didn't want to
see youse get hurt, that's all.

03:08:31.166 --> 03:08:34.208
I know you read a lot of things about me,
heard about me.

03:08:34.291 --> 03:08:35.458
I'm sorry.

03:08:38.833 --> 03:08:42.125
Can I do anything to help and make it up
to you?

03:08:54.041 --> 03:08:56.250
If you want something
a little more luxurious,

03:08:56.333 --> 03:08:58.458
we have these two models over here.

03:08:58.541 --> 03:09:00.791
They're like the Cadillacs of caskets.

03:09:01.291 --> 03:09:04.583
If we put you in the oven,
it doesn't matter what you go in.

03:09:05.166 --> 03:09:06.583
The cheapest shit possible.

03:09:06.666 --> 03:09:07.833
Particle board.

03:09:08.583 --> 03:09:10.958
What are we doin' today? A cremation?

03:09:11.791 --> 03:09:12.791
A burial.

03:09:14.250 --> 03:09:15.791
For a man or for a woman?

03:09:15.875 --> 03:09:16.750
Me.

03:09:17.875 --> 03:09:18.750
Shit.

03:09:23.500 --> 03:09:24.833
You see anything you like?

03:09:36.250 --> 03:09:37.416
That green one.

03:09:37.500 --> 03:09:38.333
That's a beauty.

03:09:38.416 --> 03:09:42.125
That one'll set you back 7,500
if you take it home today.

03:09:42.916 --> 03:09:43.916
What do you think?

03:09:45.500 --> 03:09:46.875
Can you do any better?

03:09:48.375 --> 03:09:51.791
Buddy, this is what you want to
go home in, no?

03:09:53.791 --> 03:09:56.375
We'll go six on that for you.
How about that?

03:09:57.041 --> 03:09:59.625
-Six flat cash work for you?
-That's good.

03:10:00.583 --> 03:10:01.583
Good for me.

03:10:21.625 --> 03:10:23.208
<i>Sooner or later,</i>

03:10:23.291 --> 03:10:26.375
<i>everybody put here has a date
when he's gonna go.</i>

03:10:26.458 --> 03:10:28.041
<i>That's just the way it is.</i>

03:10:29.250 --> 03:10:33.083
<i>And I think there's gotta be something
when you go...</i>

03:10:33.750 --> 03:10:36.708
<i>'cause, I mean, how the hell did this</i>

03:10:36.791 --> 03:10:38.291
<i>whole thing start?</i>

03:10:42.250 --> 03:10:44.708
<i>People smarter than me
can't figure it out.</i>

03:10:44.791 --> 03:10:48.541
<i>That's why I would never go for
cremation. It's so... It's so final.</i>

03:10:50.750 --> 03:10:51.833
This one.

03:10:53.500 --> 03:10:54.916
That's 1948.

03:10:56.166 --> 03:10:59.416
<i>The hardest part for anybody
when they bury youse</i>

03:10:59.500 --> 03:11:02.208
<i>is when they go into the ground
because it's...</i>

03:11:02.291 --> 03:11:03.333
<i>it's so final.</i>

03:11:04.666 --> 03:11:08.791
<i>If you go into a building,
the building's there. The crypt is there.</i>

03:11:08.875 --> 03:11:10.583
<i>It has to be a metal casket,</i>

03:11:10.666 --> 03:11:12.500
and they have you in the room.

03:11:12.583 --> 03:11:13.916
And all that there.

03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:15.875
It's just not as final. You're dead,

03:11:15.958 --> 03:11:18.291
but... it ain't that final.

03:11:21.375 --> 03:11:22.375
I'm sorry,

03:11:22.458 --> 03:11:26.916
but I gotta direct youse
to my attorney Mr. Ragano...

03:11:28.833 --> 03:11:31.250
if youse want to talk
about Mr. Hoffa or...

03:11:31.958 --> 03:11:33.958
or any matter for that matter.

03:11:34.041 --> 03:11:35.833
I got noth... nothing new to say.

03:11:37.041 --> 03:11:38.000
He's dead.

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:39.875
Who's dead?

03:11:40.625 --> 03:11:42.166
Your attorney, Mr. Ragano.

03:11:42.250 --> 03:11:43.791
He's dead? Who did it?

03:11:46.125 --> 03:11:47.333
Cancer.

03:11:49.791 --> 03:11:51.708
Everybody's dead, Mr. Sheeran.

03:11:53.500 --> 03:11:54.458
It's over.

03:11:55.166 --> 03:11:56.250
They're all gone.

03:11:56.833 --> 03:11:58.458
Russell, Angelo, Salerno,

03:11:58.958 --> 03:12:02.125
Pro, Dorfman, Sally Bugs. They're gone.

03:12:04.041 --> 03:12:05.458
Who are you protecting?

03:12:07.416 --> 03:12:08.791
You know who's not gone?

03:12:10.375 --> 03:12:11.333
Mr. Hoffa's family.

03:12:11.416 --> 03:12:12.625
His children.

03:12:13.333 --> 03:12:16.291
They're here.
And they gotta live not knowing.

03:12:17.916 --> 03:12:18.875
That's hard to do.

03:12:21.958 --> 03:12:23.375
You got kids, Frank.

03:12:24.166 --> 03:12:25.333
Can you imagine?

03:12:30.958 --> 03:12:34.125
Frank, it's time.
It's time you say what happened.

03:12:40.916 --> 03:12:42.916
You seem like nice fellas.

03:12:43.750 --> 03:12:45.958
I appreciate youse coming to see me.

03:12:46.458 --> 03:12:48.291
But I can't help you.

03:12:52.041 --> 03:12:52.875
That's it?

03:12:53.458 --> 03:12:54.291
That's it.

03:13:01.041 --> 03:13:03.708
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God.</i>

03:13:04.916 --> 03:13:06.500
Pray for us sinners.

03:13:07.500 --> 03:13:10.750
Now and at the hour of our death.

03:13:11.250 --> 03:13:12.250
Amen.

03:13:17.375 --> 03:13:20.291
That wasn't too bad. It's been a while.

03:13:21.041 --> 03:13:22.000
Not bad at all.

03:13:22.583 --> 03:13:24.708
And the intention was there.
The intention.

03:13:26.458 --> 03:13:28.250
I know the intention was there.

03:13:28.333 --> 03:13:29.750
It was there, Father.

03:13:31.416 --> 03:13:33.041
Do you feel anything for...

03:13:33.541 --> 03:13:35.541
for what you've done?

03:13:39.166 --> 03:13:42.375
I... I... I don't.
I mean, maybe... maybe that...

03:13:43.625 --> 03:13:47.666
because I'm here now talking to you,
that... that... in itself is a,

03:13:47.750 --> 03:13:50.750
you know, an attempt to...

03:13:54.416 --> 03:13:57.750
But you don't feel anything at all?

03:13:59.416 --> 03:14:00.583
No.

03:14:02.958 --> 03:14:04.666
Water under the dam.

03:14:09.208 --> 03:14:11.125
Any... any remorse...

03:14:11.875 --> 03:14:13.375
for the families?

03:14:13.458 --> 03:14:15.958
I didn't know the families.

03:14:18.916 --> 03:14:21.125
I didn't know 'em. Except one I knew.

03:14:25.166 --> 03:14:26.041
You know...

03:14:26.708 --> 03:14:29.666
I think we can... we can be sorry.

03:14:29.750 --> 03:14:32.958
We can be sorry
even when we don't feel sorry.

03:14:33.458 --> 03:14:37.083
Well, for us to say,
to make a decision of the will, "God,

03:14:38.083 --> 03:14:39.750
I am sorry, God.

03:14:41.541 --> 03:14:42.708
Forgive me."

03:14:44.500 --> 03:14:46.500
That's a decision of the will.

03:14:54.208 --> 03:14:55.791
What kind of man...

03:14:57.291 --> 03:15:00.083
makes a... a phone call like that?

03:15:05.666 --> 03:15:08.083
What do you mean? What phone call?

03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:10.291
I can't tell you.

03:15:12.541 --> 03:15:13.875
I can't. I got...

03:15:19.750 --> 03:15:21.750
Frank, shall we pray again?

03:15:23.500 --> 03:15:25.875
This time we'll do it
in our own words. Okay?

03:15:28.708 --> 03:15:30.625
God, we come before you,

03:15:31.291 --> 03:15:33.625
sinful and sorrowful.

03:15:33.708 --> 03:15:36.083
Sinful and sorrowful.

03:15:37.208 --> 03:15:41.166
<i>We know you are all good and all merciful.</i>

03:15:45.875 --> 03:15:47.750
<i>We ask you...</i>

03:15:49.041 --> 03:15:51.458
<i>to help us see ourselves...</i>

03:15:54.208 --> 03:15:56.291
<i>as you see us.</i>

03:16:00.041 --> 03:16:01.791
That's my daughter Peggy.

03:16:01.875 --> 03:16:02.708
Is it?

03:16:03.375 --> 03:16:04.833
I haven't met her yet.

03:16:04.916 --> 03:16:07.958
Well, she ain't been... been around
too much.

03:16:08.041 --> 03:16:09.500
Is she your only child?

03:16:09.583 --> 03:16:11.458
No, I got four daughters.

03:16:11.958 --> 03:16:12.916
Over there.

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:15.041
Beautiful.

03:16:15.625 --> 03:16:16.708
Busy man.

03:16:21.166 --> 03:16:22.333
Who's that with her?

03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:25.416
You don't know who that is?

03:16:27.458 --> 03:16:28.333
No.

03:16:29.500 --> 03:16:30.625
Jimmy Hoffa.

03:16:32.750 --> 03:16:33.791
Oh, yeah.

03:16:33.875 --> 03:16:34.916
Right, "Oh, yeah."

03:16:37.083 --> 03:16:38.541
You don't know who he is.

03:16:38.625 --> 03:16:39.958
Okay, I don't.

03:16:41.041 --> 03:16:43.250
Yeah. Oh, boy, you don't know how fast

03:16:43.333 --> 03:16:45.833
time goes by until you get there.

03:16:46.416 --> 03:16:50.958
But you don't have to worry.
You have your whole life ahead of you.

03:16:51.041 --> 03:16:52.750
Forever. It goes fast.

03:16:54.916 --> 03:16:58.333
I'm trying to take your pulse,
Mr. Sheeran. Please, don't talk.

03:17:00.458 --> 03:17:01.833
It's great today.

03:17:01.916 --> 03:17:03.416
I'm still alive?

03:17:03.500 --> 03:17:04.833
Yes, you are.

03:17:04.916 --> 03:17:06.208
That's good to know.

03:17:06.291 --> 03:17:07.541
Alive and well.

03:17:07.625 --> 03:17:08.833
And you're free...

03:17:09.416 --> 03:17:11.583
till later today when we do it all again.

03:17:11.666 --> 03:17:12.625
I'm here.

03:17:43.416 --> 03:17:45.791
Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good.

03:17:47.333 --> 03:17:49.458
His mercy endures forever.

03:17:50.041 --> 03:17:52.875
All right, Frank. I'll be back to visit
very soon,

03:17:52.958 --> 03:17:55.500
probably after the Christmas holidays.

03:17:56.000 --> 03:17:56.958
Okay.

03:17:57.041 --> 03:17:59.625
-Frank, God bless you.
-You, too. Thank you.

03:18:02.166 --> 03:18:03.250
It's Christmas?

03:18:04.458 --> 03:18:05.625
Almost.

03:18:06.500 --> 03:18:08.083
Well, I ain't going nowhere.

03:18:10.666 --> 03:18:11.625
Hey, Father?

03:18:12.791 --> 03:18:14.666
C... could you do me a favor?

03:18:15.250 --> 03:18:18.000
Don't shut the door all the way.
I don't like that.

03:18:18.083 --> 03:18:19.791
Leave it open a little bit.
