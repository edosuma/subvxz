26:57.120 --> 26:58.382
What's with the goon?

26:58.480 --> 26:59.583
Just a precaution.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.620
We're all wary, aren't we?

27:01.840 --> 27:04.297
Surely you've got
your witch-killing bullets handy.

27:06.280 --> 27:07.941
SAM: Rowena,
this isn't why I helped you.

27:08.040 --> 27:10.702
Were you just playing me the whole time?

27:11.200 --> 27:13.100
Of course not,

27:13.200 --> 27:16.180
but once I unlocked my power,
I couldn't just hide away.

27:16.320 --> 27:19.460
I realized I can right
some wrongs that are long overdue.

27:19.560 --> 27:22.427
- By killing innocents?
-Innocents?

27:22.520 --> 27:24.465
These drug company people.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.869
They lied about their product,
for money.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.425
Money they used to avoid the law.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.579
They've hurt thousands Of sick people,

27:31.680 --> 27:35.628
which makes them far worse than
most Of the monsters you've killed.

27:35.720 --> 27:39.144
- I'm striking a blow forjustice.
- SAM: Yeah?

27:39.760 --> 27:41.466
Then why're you killing reapers?

27:43.840 --> 27:46.980
Well, they're just a means to an end.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.540
It's not easy to get Death's attention.

27:49.640 --> 27:51.824
Well, trust me, that's not the kind
Of attention you want.

27:52.560 --> 27:55.620
Oh, but it is.
Death has something I want.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.429
What's that?

27:59.520 --> 28:00.737
My son.

28:02.760 --> 28:05.547
After you told me he was gone,
how he died,

28:06.560 --> 28:08.744
I had an unexpected reaction. I...

28:09.400 --> 28:11.504
We had our differences,

28:11.600 --> 28:14.307
but it's my fault
he went down the path he did.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.027
I left him.

28:17.720 --> 28:21.099
We're talking about Crowley,
demon King of Hell.

28:21.520 --> 28:24.341
We're talking about Fergus, a man,

28:24.440 --> 28:28.183
abandoned and loveless,
tricked by a demon, died in a gutter.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.987
He deserved better from the world.
From me.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.825
Well, Crowley's dead.
There's no coming back from that.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.027
Is that so, Dean?

28:36.120 --> 28:39.100
Are only Winchesters allowed
to come back from the dead?

28:39.200 --> 28:42.579
The rest Of us just have tO accept it?
I don't think so.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.102
I'm putting Death on notice.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.344
All right. Well, she's taken notice.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.546
"She"? Interesting.

28:48.640 --> 28:49.743
DEAN: And she's upset.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.501
But you can quit this before--

28:51.600 --> 28:52.783
I'm not afraid.

28:53.280 --> 28:56.784
And, as much as I enjoy
our little talks, you can't stop me.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.023
Actually, we can.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.542

28:59.640 --> 29:02.017
Because every version of your death,
your real, permanent death,

29:02.120 --> 29:03.109
