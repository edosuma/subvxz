00:00.077 --> 00:01.528
Previously on "Greenleaf"...

00:02.844 --> 00:05.532
- How was that?
- Might have been a little flat.

00:05.533 --> 00:08.732
- You sit there, you watch.
- Are you okay?

00:08.733 --> 00:11.238
Real transformation is the goal.

00:11.239 --> 00:14.086
I can get you on a flight
to Nashville tomorrow.

00:14.087 --> 00:16.038
Thanks for being so nice to me.

00:16.698 --> 00:18.586
Do what you do best. Just look away.

00:18.587 --> 00:20.314
She knew about Mac and faith.

00:20.315 --> 00:21.657
You get out of my house right now.

00:21.658 --> 00:23.631
You let him sit right here
at the table next to you.

00:23.632 --> 00:24.655
- Gigi!
- Stop it.

00:24.656 --> 00:26.809
- I swear to god.
- That is enough!

00:26.810 --> 00:28.506
Should have left it alone, Gigi.

00:28.507 --> 00:29.562
What have you done?

00:29.563 --> 00:31.001
You think there's not
going to be consequences

00:31.002 --> 00:33.082
- messing in my life?
- Mac...

00:34.747 --> 00:36.604
Where is she?! Where is my daughter?!

00:36.638 --> 00:38.045
Stupid.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

01:03.696 --> 01:05.766
Tell me where my daughter is.

01:06.289 --> 01:09.169
- Call an ambulance.
- Tell me where she is.

01:12.695 --> 01:17.622
Tell me... Where... She is.

01:19.608 --> 01:22.135
- I don't know.
- Tell me where she is.

01:22.136 --> 01:24.623
I don't know, Gigi. Call somebody.

01:24.648 --> 01:27.104
No. No.

01:28.595 --> 01:30.867
Please, baby.

01:35.824 --> 01:37.263
I'm not calling anybody

01:37.264 --> 01:40.667
till you tell me where my daughter is.

01:41.629 --> 01:44.061
I'm sorry.

01:46.989 --> 01:48.467
Mac?

01:49.136 --> 01:50.203
Mac.

01:50.358 --> 01:51.734
Mac!

01:56.573 --> 01:58.492
Mac. Mac.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.964
Mac!

02:05.277 --> 02:06.568
Mac.

02:09.181 --> 02:10.300
Mac...

02:10.300 --> 02:12.115
911, what is your emergency?

02:13.053 --> 02:15.228
You say that Mr. McCready
slammed you against the wall

02:15.229 --> 02:17.916
- and choked you?
- Yeah, he tried to kill me.

02:17.917 --> 02:21.435
- Are you two friends?
- Why would you ask me that?

02:21.436 --> 02:24.157
I'm curious why he even
let you into his home.

02:28.768 --> 02:31.039
- He didn't exactly let me in.
- You kicked down the door?

02:31.040 --> 02:35.103
- No. He opened the door.
- You marched in uninvited?

02:35.104 --> 02:36.863
Like I told the other cop
who mirandized me,

02:36.864 --> 02:38.495
I thought he had my daughter.

02:38.496 --> 02:40.671
This is how I look at this.

02:40.672 --> 02:43.775
You thought Mr. McCready
had kidnapped your daughter.

02:43.776 --> 02:46.239
In my line of work, that's a motive.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.663
He sustained a wound
inflicted by a bottle

02:49.664 --> 02:53.663
that we both agreed bears
your prints... that's a weapon.

02:53.664 --> 02:55.840
You come over here, and now he's dead.

02:57.664 --> 02:58.912
She's home.

03:01.105 --> 03:03.760
- She's all right?
- She sounded fine.

03:04.896 --> 03:07.392
Thank you. Thank you.

03:15.840 --> 03:19.360
- You think I murdered him.
- It's crossing my mind.

03:30.144 --> 03:32.384
Amen.

04:55.757 --> 04:58.188
Hey, it's okay.

05:05.834 --> 05:07.434
Hey, Nathan.

05:10.025 --> 05:11.050
I got you.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.472
Hair up.

05:25.128 --> 05:27.559
Hold it higher. Hold it right there.

05:28.808 --> 05:30.919
Okay, let me see the knees.

05:35.656 --> 05:37.336
Come on, turn around.
Let me see your back.

05:38.056 --> 05:39.367
Hold up your hair.

05:45.927 --> 05:48.359
Okay, turn back around.

05:58.632 --> 06:00.551
Make sure you get the cut
on her right hand.

06:00.552 --> 06:02.345
And that one, too.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.159
Both hands up.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.768
Am I under arrest?

06:08.744 --> 06:10.645
No, pastor. You're free to go.

06:21.064 --> 06:23.408
But I'll be calling you in
for a sitdown tomorrow.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.327
Count on it.

06:33.158 --> 06:35.078
Take care of yourself, Grace.

06:45.416 --> 06:47.398
There was this one time...

06:47.399 --> 06:48.551
Yes?

06:48.552 --> 06:50.726
Mac must have been about 5 or 6,

06:50.727 --> 06:52.326
and we were going down to this...

06:52.327 --> 06:54.314
Mae. Mae.

06:55.527 --> 06:57.767
Our daughter nearly died tonight.

06:57.768 --> 07:00.838
Pardon me if I ask to be excused
from hearing some fond memory

07:00.839 --> 07:02.568
about the man who tried to kill her.

07:13.741 --> 07:15.948
Daddy.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.766
Where's Sophia?

07:30.695 --> 07:31.847
We left her home.

07:31.848 --> 07:33.478
We didn't know how you would look.

07:34.887 --> 07:36.262
Okay.

07:43.527 --> 07:48.167
I know you must read
my natural reserve as judgement,

07:48.168 --> 07:50.567
so I'm going to be clear.

07:52.448 --> 07:54.833
I am so relieved that you're alive,

07:55.744 --> 07:57.760
and I don't blame you.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.656
No.

08:03.936 --> 08:06.335
I know that it was self defense.

08:06.336 --> 08:09.792
Yes, it was, Mom. It was.

08:14.047 --> 08:15.729
I love you.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.522
I love you, Mom.

08:18.688 --> 08:21.311
My Lord.

08:24.607 --> 08:26.911
I love you.

08:31.104 --> 08:33.342
I love you.

09:08.127 --> 09:09.727
Hey.

09:11.442 --> 09:15.185
I'm okay. I'm okay.

09:15.210 --> 09:16.915
I'm okay, baby.

09:22.683 --> 09:24.122
Texting Kevin with the news,

09:24.123 --> 09:26.746
but I'm telling him not to tell Charity

09:26.747 --> 09:28.858
because she's 200 miles away,

09:28.859 --> 09:30.845
and it's the middle of the night.

09:31.323 --> 09:33.139
We can call her in the morning.

09:34.427 --> 09:36.058
Or we can wait till
she gets home tomorrow,

09:36.059 --> 09:37.936
I mean, what's the point?

09:39.611 --> 09:41.305
I don't want her racing
back here trying to prove

09:41.306 --> 09:44.602
that she's... Of use. It's just...

09:44.603 --> 09:47.862
There's nothing to do,
and she's just so weary.

09:48.494 --> 09:50.351
Whatever you want, dear.

10:03.835 --> 10:05.465
Where were you?

10:05.466 --> 10:07.033
What do you mean?

10:07.034 --> 10:09.082
I was calling you when you were
supposed to be at dinner.

10:09.083 --> 10:12.475
Where were you, baby?
I thought he had you.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.527
I was with Zora at the studio.

10:18.939 --> 10:21.369
She called me when I was on my way

10:21.370 --> 10:25.860
to meet you guys and asked for a ride.

10:25.885 --> 10:27.869
So why didn't you
pick up the phone?

10:30.591 --> 10:32.415
It died.

10:33.818 --> 10:35.834
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

10:37.619 --> 10:41.202
It's not my fault you went over
there and did whatever you did.

10:41.203 --> 10:43.543
Sweetheart, I never said it was.

10:44.274 --> 10:46.707
I was just worried.

10:48.851 --> 10:51.858
I was worried something
happened, and I didn't know...

10:51.859 --> 10:52.946
I didn't know where you were.

10:52.947 --> 10:55.096
I couldn't get a hold of you, so...

10:56.627 --> 10:59.443
You know I would give my life for you.

11:00.531 --> 11:01.906
Are you going to go to jail?

11:04.572 --> 11:08.943
Baby, I don't know. I don't think so.

11:09.450 --> 11:11.279
You know it's self defense, right?

11:12.403 --> 11:13.618
Yeah, I know.

11:13.619 --> 11:16.754
Okay. Good.

11:16.755 --> 11:18.661
But you did go over there

11:19.135 --> 11:23.416
after you told me you were going to try.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.460
I was looking for you.

11:27.167 --> 11:29.760
I'm not saying it's
your fault, I'm just...

11:33.431 --> 11:36.791
explaining it. Whatever. You know?

11:38.781 --> 11:40.600
I hate this.

11:43.645 --> 11:45.085
Me, too.

13:51.230 --> 13:54.205
- Mr. Satterlee, you're up early.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:54.206 --> 13:56.637
I'm going to try to head to the
office and get some work done.

13:56.638 --> 13:58.462
Can you keep an eye on him
until the first lady...

13:58.463 --> 13:59.774
Of course.

13:59.775 --> 14:02.910
- What a cute outfit.
- Yeah.

14:02.911 --> 14:06.079
Just, keeping him fresh
for the ladies.

14:06.622 --> 14:08.253
All right, little man.
You be good, okay?

14:10.718 --> 14:13.294
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:13.823 --> 14:16.285
What a good Daddy you have.

14:16.286 --> 14:17.726
Yeah.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.077
What are you going to tell bishop?

14:22.078 --> 14:23.805
Just the facts.

14:24.414 --> 14:27.902
The land belongs to us.
Basie's out of the picture.

14:28.894 --> 14:30.909
What do you think he'll say?

14:30.910 --> 14:32.381
I don't know.

14:34.398 --> 14:35.805
That's why they call
them other people...

14:35.806 --> 14:38.045
you got to get up
in their face to find out.

14:38.046 --> 14:39.612
Just wish me luck.

14:40.542 --> 14:42.301
The fact that you're talking about luck

14:42.302 --> 14:44.125
proves that this is foolishness.

14:44.126 --> 14:45.758
Pray for me.

14:45.759 --> 14:48.288
I don't know if that's going to
work either, but I'll do it.

14:49.310 --> 14:50.498
Thank you.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.166
Bye.

14:58.366 --> 15:00.605
My inbox is fuller
than pharaoh's storehouse

15:00.606 --> 15:02.046
after Joseph took over.

15:04.478 --> 15:06.109
News travels fast.

15:06.110 --> 15:08.381
Yes, well that's why Grace
has to go into work today

15:08.382 --> 15:10.173
with her head held high.

15:10.174 --> 15:11.311
High.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.501
No more scandal.

15:13.502 --> 15:14.981
Mac is dead.

15:15.838 --> 15:18.173
Gigi had motive and opportunity.

15:18.174 --> 15:19.710
How can this be without scandal?

15:19.711 --> 15:23.133
No. It was self defense. She's a hero.

15:23.134 --> 15:25.085
Or, that's what we're
going to tell them, anyway.

15:25.086 --> 15:26.534
Grace is a hero.

15:27.845 --> 15:29.444
Wow.

15:31.262 --> 15:32.637
Did you just call me a hero?

15:32.638 --> 15:34.493
Well, your father and I
were just discussing

15:34.494 --> 15:37.373
how we're going to handle
this with the deacons,

15:37.374 --> 15:41.789
and that's why I think
it is of paramount importance

15:41.790 --> 15:44.594
that we cast a positive light on this.

15:44.921 --> 15:48.056
God gave you the strength to prevail.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.058
You almost sound convinced, mom.

15:51.109 --> 15:52.707
Well, it's not as if I
would have preferred it

15:52.708 --> 15:56.272
to go the other way.
I was up all night just praying,

15:57.156 --> 15:59.203
thanking god that he saved you.

15:59.204 --> 16:01.028
She didn't sleep a wink.

16:03.460 --> 16:08.836
The question is how we move
through this proudly and fast.

16:08.837 --> 16:12.771
I'm sorry. Has anybody
seen Kevin, by any chance?

16:12.772 --> 16:14.244
Well, he's already at the church.

16:14.245 --> 16:18.180
Well, might as well get
myself there now.

16:19.972 --> 16:21.476
I'm going to call all these old biddies

16:21.477 --> 16:23.459
and tell them to throw away
their police scanners

16:23.460 --> 16:25.188
and open the Bible.

16:28.133 --> 16:29.668
I love you, Gigi.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.275
Aaron, is there anything
I can do to help?

16:38.276 --> 16:40.580
No. No, I'll just see him at work.

16:40.581 --> 16:41.776
Thanks.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.501
All right, then.

16:45.317 --> 16:47.523
And we'll go over your
statement at the office

16:47.524 --> 16:49.891
before you go downtown?

16:49.892 --> 16:52.964
- Proudly.
- Okay. Later.

16:59.812 --> 17:01.316
Praise God he's here, right?

17:03.467 --> 17:05.321
The lord knows what he's doing.

17:07.980 --> 17:10.377
Don't you give an inch today.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.227
I don't plan on it.

17:12.228 --> 17:14.267
No apologies.

17:15.019 --> 17:16.554
No regrets.

17:16.579 --> 17:19.810
- Understood?
- Understood.

17:22.788 --> 17:25.540
Hold me close

17:25.540 --> 17:28.643
and you heal me

17:28.644 --> 17:32.740
with your light - oooohooooh.

17:34.789 --> 17:38.116
Okay, ladies, that's good.

17:40.324 --> 17:43.428
- So, what do you think?
- They sound amazing.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.700
It's a great song. That helps.

17:45.701 --> 17:47.459
- Yeah.
- Come on, let me introduce you.

17:47.460 --> 17:50.179
Well, let me just call Kevin
and see how the baby's doing,

17:50.180 --> 17:52.131
and I'll be right in.

17:52.132 --> 17:53.955
- Yeah, take your time.
- Okay.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.872
Hey. How are you?

18:02.873 --> 18:06.231
Good. Just got to Jabari's.

18:06.232 --> 18:08.055
And I wanted to see how the night went.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.648
Babywise? Without a hitch.

18:10.649 --> 18:11.991
But...

18:11.992 --> 18:13.911
What happened?

18:13.912 --> 18:15.864
Your mother told me not to tell you.

18:15.865 --> 18:16.951
She didn't want you to worry.

18:16.952 --> 18:19.544
What happened, Kevin? Just tell me.

18:19.545 --> 18:22.376
Well, everything's okay. It's just...

18:22.808 --> 18:24.727
Well, apparently Gigi
went to see Mac last night

18:24.728 --> 18:26.839
to get in his face
about something, and...

18:27.494 --> 18:29.541
and, well, she won.

18:29.688 --> 18:31.219
Um...

18:32.089 --> 18:33.464
Wwhat does that mean?

18:34.361 --> 18:35.865
He's dead.

18:38.105 --> 18:39.268
Are...

18:39.609 --> 18:41.103
Are you serious?

18:41.529 --> 18:43.927
- Yeah.
- I...

18:43.928 --> 18:45.303
II got to get home.

18:45.304 --> 18:46.584
I just wanted to tell you

18:46.585 --> 18:48.887
'cause we know how you don't
like being left out of the loop.

18:48.888 --> 18:51.155
No, I... I don't, um...

18:51.545 --> 18:53.752
- Thanks for telling me.
- You got it.

18:53.753 --> 18:55.287
Wow.

18:55.288 --> 18:56.345
Um...

18:59.865 --> 19:03.191
Gigi's okay? She's not hurt?

19:03.192 --> 19:06.379
Gigi is fine. I promise, Charity.

19:06.872 --> 19:08.152
Kev.

19:08.153 --> 19:12.215
I know it's been really hard,
us breaking up and...

19:12.552 --> 19:14.519
- Moving out.
- Yeah.

19:14.520 --> 19:19.033
I think this could work out,
us being friends like this.

19:22.965 --> 19:25.107
Yeah. Of course.

19:26.809 --> 19:28.920
I'll see you tonight.

19:28.921 --> 19:30.167
See you tonight.

19:30.168 --> 19:32.023
And kiss that baby for me, please.

19:32.024 --> 19:33.784
I miss him so much.

19:33.785 --> 19:36.887
Well, he misses you, too.

19:36.888 --> 19:38.648
Okay. Bye.

19:42.392 --> 19:44.184
Bye.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.143
Glad you're okay.

19:57.144 --> 19:58.889
Me, too.

19:59.416 --> 20:01.079
How you holding up?

20:03.576 --> 20:04.823
I'm okay, I guess.

20:04.824 --> 20:06.552
I mean, I'm a little sore, but...

20:08.537 --> 20:09.781
Walk you to your office?

20:09.782 --> 20:11.833
Thank you.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.043
Yeah.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.871
You did what you had to do.

20:18.872 --> 20:20.217
I'm glad you did.

20:22.904 --> 20:24.760
So, what are you here
to talk to Daddy about?

20:24.761 --> 20:26.007
The injunction, or...?

20:26.008 --> 20:28.023
No, I think that thing's run its course.

20:28.024 --> 20:29.431
But, yeah, I have something else

20:29.432 --> 20:31.543
that I think will make
things right between us.

20:31.544 --> 20:34.647
- You're coming back to Calvary?
- It's not out of the question.

20:34.648 --> 20:37.879
Aww. Jacob.

20:39.769 --> 20:42.776
I think you've got somebody
waiting for you in your office.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.472
Yeah.

20:50.360 --> 20:51.896
- Love you, brother.
- Love you, too.

20:56.568 --> 20:58.265
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.399
- Hey.
- Yeah.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.519
What happened?

21:24.344 --> 21:26.200
This is Mavis McCready.

21:26.201 --> 21:29.041
If you're looking to
book Alonzo Ashbury,

21:29.042 --> 21:31.267
leave your name, your venue, and a date.

21:31.268 --> 21:32.548
I'll get back to you.

21:32.636 --> 21:34.874
Anybody else, speak your piece
and keep it brief.

21:34.875 --> 21:36.186
Don't fill up my mailbox.

21:46.715 --> 21:48.475
So, is there anything that I can do?

21:50.843 --> 21:52.795
Not that I can think of.

21:53.883 --> 21:55.642
I just have to convince this cop today

21:55.643 --> 21:59.051
that I didn't go over there
with malicious intent.

21:59.547 --> 22:00.858
Well, from the look of those bruises,

22:00.859 --> 22:02.874
I don't think you're going
to have any trouble

22:02.875 --> 22:04.807
proving self defense.

22:05.307 --> 22:07.419
Your mouth to god's ears.

22:08.539 --> 22:11.066
Have you prayed about it?

22:11.067 --> 22:13.658
Might be a good time to toss one up.

22:13.659 --> 22:16.068
I don't think god would listen.

22:16.956 --> 22:19.419
- What?
- He was a bad guy.

22:24.410 --> 22:25.870
I know.

22:26.587 --> 22:28.539
And it's good that he's gone.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.083
I know.

22:31.708 --> 22:33.836
And it's good that you're still here.

22:35.099 --> 22:36.508
It is.

22:41.371 --> 22:43.195
I have to practice my lines.

22:47.035 --> 22:49.339
Thank you for coming
all this way to see me.

22:49.340 --> 22:50.908
Hey, you got it.

23:31.905 --> 23:33.056
So, Mr. Skanks...

23:33.057 --> 23:35.850
I won't call that joker
a pastor any longer.

23:35.910 --> 23:38.309
He's proved he's unworthy of the title.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.581
He's truly out of the picture?

23:40.903 --> 23:41.903
You don't believe me?

23:42.112 --> 23:43.112
Well...

23:43.322 --> 23:44.581
Pop, what do you think this is?

23:44.582 --> 23:47.973
Some kind of elaborate con game?

23:48.327 --> 23:51.429
I have the deed. The land is mine.

23:51.705 --> 23:53.604
The last time you were here, Jacob...

23:53.605 --> 23:54.757
I don't know if you blocked out,

23:54.758 --> 23:56.484
and I don't blame you if you did...

23:56.485 --> 23:59.675
you and that diminutive
demon staged a sitin

23:59.676 --> 24:01.368
and wasted a day of my life

24:01.369 --> 24:06.430
while jawing about how you all
were going to bring me down.

24:06.570 --> 24:07.972
Fair enough.

24:08.620 --> 24:12.601
Pop, we have the opportunity
to do something together.

24:13.631 --> 24:15.006
To grow Calvary into something better

24:15.007 --> 24:16.926
than its ever been before.

24:16.927 --> 24:19.316
- We?
- Yeah.

24:20.382 --> 24:22.334
All right, what's your end game?

24:22.335 --> 24:24.638
You come back to Calvary. Then what?

24:24.639 --> 24:26.526
We copastor.

24:26.527 --> 24:27.998
Trading off Sundays,

24:27.999 --> 24:30.654
build whatever we want
across the street.

24:30.655 --> 24:32.670
- What?
- Copastor?

24:32.671 --> 24:35.249
Yeah, Gigi is a preacher and...

24:35.775 --> 24:37.534
Pop, let's be honest, you need help.

24:37.535 --> 24:39.454
So how about I get it how I want?

24:39.455 --> 24:41.797
- Pop...
- Let me finish.

24:43.007 --> 24:44.190
I don't need a copastor

24:44.191 --> 24:46.590
any more than I need
a cane to walk with.

25:15.263 --> 25:17.118
Hey, you reached Kevin. Leave a message.

25:17.119 --> 25:19.518
Hey, Kevin. It's Aaron.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.879
Just checking in,
seeing how you're doing.

25:22.335 --> 25:23.998
Hope you're cool.

25:25.466 --> 25:26.655
Call me back.

25:34.687 --> 25:36.477
Have you talked to Isaiah since...?

25:36.478 --> 25:38.771
Yeah, we had a discussion.

25:39.551 --> 25:41.758
You shouldn't see him again.

25:41.759 --> 25:44.670
Your concern has been noted.

25:44.671 --> 25:47.645
Zora, you deserve to be
with someone who...

25:47.646 --> 25:51.909
I don't know, helps you shine
brighter, not dims your light.

25:52.286 --> 25:53.886
Why do you worship
the ground he walks on?

25:53.887 --> 25:55.934
- He can't even really sing.
- Okay.

25:55.935 --> 25:57.790
Now you're walling.

25:58.165 --> 25:59.704
You keep walking, I'll leave.

25:59.705 --> 26:03.005
The Zora I know would never
let anyone talk sideways to her

26:03.006 --> 26:06.173
let alone punish her
for telling the truth.

26:07.716 --> 26:09.919
Then stay with him.

26:12.137 --> 26:14.473
Fine. Fine.

26:15.230 --> 26:16.478
I'll dump him.

26:16.479 --> 26:19.645
- Promise?
- I promise.

26:24.159 --> 26:26.944
But you have to help me find a new bae.

26:28.570 --> 26:31.038
I'll make it my summer job.

26:31.496 --> 26:32.999
All right now.

26:33.024 --> 26:34.335
- Come on.
- Okay.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.990
Give me a bite of that thing.

26:35.991 --> 26:37.910
Have it. It smells like feet.

26:37.911 --> 26:39.638
Athlete's foot, I swear. It's crazy.

26:44.695 --> 26:47.640
So, okay, he was on
top of me, choking me.

26:49.784 --> 26:51.799
That's when I grabbed the bottle.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.554
Okay, no.

26:54.264 --> 26:56.599
Say that you were afraid
you were going to die.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.815
Then you grabbed the bottle.

26:57.816 --> 26:59.671
Okay? Life or death.

26:59.672 --> 27:02.980
Okay, he was on top of me, choking me.

27:04.024 --> 27:07.234
I... I thought I was going to die.

27:07.671 --> 27:08.919
I grabbed the bottle and swung it.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.743
- Then nothing.
- What do you mean?

27:10.744 --> 27:12.534
In your statement, you said
that you didn't remember

27:12.535 --> 27:14.519
what happened after
you swung the bottle.

27:14.520 --> 27:16.374
Don't start remembering now.

27:16.375 --> 27:18.120
Understood?

27:20.215 --> 27:21.400
Okay.

27:23.543 --> 27:25.847
He let go, and he fell to the floor.

27:25.848 --> 27:27.546
Then what?

27:28.280 --> 27:29.943
I told you that's all I remember.

27:29.944 --> 27:32.727
Must be something
in the water around here.

27:32.728 --> 27:35.031
- It's like flint.
- How so?

27:35.032 --> 27:36.311
All the amnesia.

27:36.312 --> 27:38.454
It seems like half the killers
come in here have it.

27:38.455 --> 27:40.663
I told you everything I know.

27:40.664 --> 27:42.352
Not sure you have.

27:43.544 --> 27:47.224
Something happened after you
stabbed Mr. McCready, didn't it?

27:51.031 --> 27:52.439
Something?

27:57.944 --> 28:00.470
- You called 911.
- Yeah, I called 911.

28:00.471 --> 28:03.255
Immediately after Mr. McCready's
body hit the floor?

28:06.948 --> 28:08.119
This meeting's over.

28:10.391 --> 28:12.598
Yeah, I know.

28:12.883 --> 28:14.264
I just ended it.

28:16.151 --> 28:17.591
We'll be in touch, Pastor.

28:29.719 --> 28:30.742
I'll be honest.

28:30.743 --> 28:31.894
I don't know
quite what to do at this point.

28:31.895 --> 28:34.087
I told you bishop
was going to be like that.

28:34.192 --> 28:35.215
I know. You were right.

28:35.216 --> 28:37.103
- Will you remember for next time?
- Yes.

28:37.104 --> 28:38.736
Every time you don't listen
to me, bad things happen.

28:38.737 --> 28:39.824
That's a fact.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.663
All right, so we have no money.

28:43.664 --> 28:46.031
We have a piece of land
we can't afford to build on.

28:46.032 --> 28:48.943
- Let's just go talk to Greg.
- Greg who?

28:48.944 --> 28:51.568
- The guy from "Voice of Life."
- "Voice of Life"?

28:51.569 --> 28:53.136
Maybe he can cut you a TV deal,

28:53.137 --> 28:54.703
you can make some money that way.

28:54.704 --> 28:56.495
No, I don't want to do that, no.

28:56.496 --> 28:58.415
You would be good on TV, Jacob.

28:58.416 --> 29:01.711
Maybe, but the way he came onto you?

29:01.712 --> 29:04.431
What kind of man does that
make me if I partner with him?

29:04.432 --> 29:05.903
A man with a job.

29:05.904 --> 29:08.303
Now that all our savings
went to that land,

29:08.304 --> 29:09.711
you're going to have to do something

29:09.712 --> 29:11.983
because we can't just live on
what I make at the school,

29:11.984 --> 29:13.711
not even here.

29:13.712 --> 29:16.837
Yeah, I hear you. I just don't
want to go down that road

29:16.862 --> 29:18.237
if I don't have to.

29:20.624 --> 29:22.383
That's for me?

29:22.384 --> 29:25.839
You can't face a moment
like this on an empty stomach.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.824
At least not my man.

29:30.032 --> 29:31.951
What?

29:32.532 --> 29:34.229
I know what to do.

29:40.692 --> 29:42.431
How'd it go downtown?

29:43.473 --> 29:45.100
Not good.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.847
Well, tell me all about it.

29:49.062 --> 29:51.535
I'll bet it went better than you think.

29:51.815 --> 29:53.615
I need you to do something for me.

29:53.616 --> 29:56.904
Look, just tell me what happened.

30:00.357 --> 30:02.479
If it turns out I go to jail over this,

30:02.898 --> 30:04.530
promise me that you'll do
whatever it takes

30:04.531 --> 30:05.969
to keep Sophia.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.666
Her dad is going to try
to take her back.

30:07.667 --> 30:10.481
I don't really think it'll come to that.

30:10.482 --> 30:12.370
Do you actually think
they'll press charges?

30:12.371 --> 30:14.001
It was clearly self defense.

30:14.002 --> 30:15.772
I know that, Daddy.

30:16.467 --> 30:19.505
But they also know that I'd
been harassing Mac for months.

30:19.506 --> 30:23.186
What I did to his car is...

30:23.557 --> 30:25.106
It is not good.

30:25.107 --> 30:26.641
If they try to make you pay,

30:26.642 --> 30:30.103
we will move heaven and earth
to keep you out of jail.

30:31.271 --> 30:34.929
- What if you can't?
- Then god will find a way.

30:34.930 --> 30:38.513
Look at this family, all we've survived.

30:38.514 --> 30:39.986
I wish I had your faith.

30:41.281 --> 30:43.242
I wish you did, too.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.778
It's all right.

30:49.651 --> 30:51.345
Great having you guys, as usual.

30:51.346 --> 30:54.129
Thank you for always being transparent.

30:54.461 --> 30:56.205
So, remember, every time
you have a wayward

30:56.241 --> 30:57.456
thought or desire,

30:57.481 --> 30:58.856
I want you to take a dose.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.296
That may make you a bit nauseous,

31:00.297 --> 31:02.216
but that's very normal.

31:02.217 --> 31:03.470
I screwed up.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.927
Be right back. Everything okay?

31:09.928 --> 31:12.648
No. No, it's not.

31:12.649 --> 31:14.888
None of this works. This is all a lie.

31:14.889 --> 31:17.704
- None of it works!
- Look, um...

31:18.007 --> 31:20.584
- Look, Kevin, it's okay.
- No.

31:20.585 --> 31:23.528
No. It doesn't work.
This whole thing is a lie.

31:23.529 --> 31:26.120
It's not about being perfect, okay?

31:26.285 --> 31:27.784
It's about keeping working and trying

31:27.785 --> 31:29.928
- until something clicks here.
- This is all pointless.

31:29.929 --> 31:32.244
People need to figure out who they are.

31:32.245 --> 31:34.218
All of y'all are lying to yourself!

31:34.292 --> 31:35.378
Can we talk outside?

31:35.379 --> 31:37.087
No, I'm not going nowhere with you!

31:37.811 --> 31:42.866
I'm driving myself crazy trying
to do what you say is right.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.845
Kevin, you have to do the work.

31:45.460 --> 31:47.097
You're a liar.

32:13.683 --> 32:18.483
God, be merciful on me,
sinner that I am.

32:39.091 --> 32:41.619
I'm so sorry.
I tried to do the right thing.

32:46.804 --> 32:49.588
You know my heart, Lord.
You know my heart.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.876
You know my heart.

32:56.166 --> 32:57.587
Forgive me.

32:59.795 --> 33:01.556
Forgive me.

33:05.075 --> 33:07.060
But don't take my daughter away.

33:13.524 --> 33:15.727
- Hello, honey.
- Hey, Daddy.

33:20.019 --> 33:23.794
I spent my whole trip
worried sick about you.

33:24.787 --> 33:26.611
Little, who told you what happened?

33:26.612 --> 33:28.073
Kevy did.

33:29.716 --> 33:33.235
Well, how'd it go?
Come on, sit down, tell us.

33:33.236 --> 33:35.795
It's okay. I...

33:37.332 --> 33:40.377
Feels wrong trying to talk
about that when...

33:41.128 --> 33:42.962
Considering everything
that you've been through.

33:42.963 --> 33:44.147
My god, Gigi.

33:44.148 --> 33:46.641
- No, we want to hear about it.
- Yes.

33:46.702 --> 33:48.909
Yes, we could use
some good news around here.

33:51.310 --> 33:55.245
It was... it was good.
II had a great time.

33:55.246 --> 33:58.733
- That's wonderful.
- Jabari was so supportive.

33:58.734 --> 34:00.940
I'm sure he was.

34:00.941 --> 34:03.308
And the group recording
my song sounded amazing,

34:03.309 --> 34:05.805
and they want more songs.

34:05.806 --> 34:07.340
I knew that would be a blessing.

34:07.341 --> 34:10.413
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

34:10.414 --> 34:12.781
That's so good.

34:12.782 --> 34:14.476
That means a lot.

34:14.476 --> 34:17.164
Honestly, I'm just happy you're okay.

34:18.094 --> 34:19.853
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:19.853 --> 34:22.380
Gigi.

34:27.726 --> 34:30.168
- I'm okay.
- Now I'll go hug my baby.

34:30.196 --> 34:33.440
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Night, mama.

34:33.487 --> 34:36.367
- Baby.
- Love you.

34:36.368 --> 34:39.469
- Love you, Daddy.
- Good night, baby.

34:46.052 --> 34:47.619
Well, he just had to go and spoil

34:47.643 --> 34:49.563
the end of that girl's trip.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.507
Doesn't seem spoiled to me, mama.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.834
Kevin?

35:05.456 --> 35:07.951
Shh. He's not here.

35:07.952 --> 35:09.743
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

35:09.744 --> 35:11.983
He just asked me to watch
the baby until you got home.

35:11.984 --> 35:13.028
Thank you, Maricel.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.016
Appreciate it.

35:23.119 --> 35:24.528
Mama's baby.

35:39.056 --> 35:40.240
Kevin.

35:43.664 --> 35:47.726
I've been married long enough
to know when to ask,

35:47.727 --> 35:49.391
"have I done something wrong?"

35:55.759 --> 35:58.598
I know you don't understand why,

35:59.184 --> 36:01.768
but I am grieving for Robert.

36:04.751 --> 36:06.703
No, I don't understand.

36:06.704 --> 36:10.652
Well... he was young once.

36:12.362 --> 36:14.671
And I'm sure it's hard
for you to imagine now,

36:14.672 --> 36:17.711
but he wasn't always
the devil he became.

36:17.712 --> 36:23.311
Every Friday, Daddy would cash
his paycheck at tristate bank

36:23.802 --> 36:26.458
and he'd take us kids
with him because afterwards,

36:26.459 --> 36:28.837
we would go and have us a ice cream.

36:30.170 --> 36:33.396
And one day, the teller asked Daddy

36:33.397 --> 36:35.453
what we were all going
to do with that money,

36:35.454 --> 36:36.697
and he said,

36:37.168 --> 36:38.735
"well Imma give them
all a roll of nickels

36:38.736 --> 36:41.230
so they can play pinball
while I get drunk."

36:43.344 --> 36:47.535
- Sounds like Henry.
- He was just joking.

36:47.536 --> 36:51.401
And I knew that. Mavis knew it.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.279
But Robert didn't.

36:59.801 --> 37:05.139
Then we went outside
and he burst into tears,

37:05.181 --> 37:08.918
and he said, "I don't
want to go to the bar."

37:09.374 --> 37:12.509
And I said, "Daddy
was just kidding."

37:14.382 --> 37:16.060
But...

37:16.061 --> 37:17.427
but he...

37:18.654 --> 37:21.120
Was in a mood for the rest of the day

37:21.121 --> 37:25.185
because he was sensitive that way.

37:31.566 --> 37:37.639
Now, only god knows
why people do what they do,

37:37.712 --> 37:44.560
but sometimes I think
that Mac became the way he was

37:45.401 --> 37:47.257
watching Daddy...

37:50.996 --> 37:52.724
and what he did to me.

37:56.708 --> 37:57.866
Mae?

37:58.101 --> 37:59.477
No.

38:02.711 --> 38:03.831
Mae.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.555
No.

38:24.953 --> 38:26.841
Coming.

38:32.681 --> 38:33.992
I'm coming.

38:33.993 --> 38:35.015
Hey.

38:35.016 --> 38:36.679
- Grace, you got a minute?
- Aaron. Yeah.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.111
Come on in, come on in.

38:39.112 --> 38:41.192
Did you hear something?

38:42.025 --> 38:44.327
You did..

38:45.061 --> 38:46.436
It's good news.

38:47.225 --> 38:48.484
What?

38:48.485 --> 38:51.771
Prosecutor's office isn't going
to pursue charges against you.

38:52.613 --> 38:54.710
- Why?
- What?

38:54.711 --> 38:56.611
It seemed like they were
going to, didn't it?

38:56.612 --> 38:59.844
Yeah, it did, but... You're clear.

39:01.609 --> 39:03.145
So it's all done?

39:04.498 --> 39:05.559
Yeah.

39:05.961 --> 39:07.305
Congratulations.

39:08.887 --> 39:10.263
I don't believe it.

39:13.293 --> 39:16.439
Yeah. Well, you know what they say.

39:16.921 --> 39:20.349
Sometimes the bear gets you,
sometimes you get the bear.

40:18.538 --> 40:21.483
You know how many times
I'd prayed not to go to jail?

40:27.395 --> 40:29.633
Hundreds.
