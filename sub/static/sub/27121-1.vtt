<i>In ancient Russia,
people said,</i>

01:41.717 --> 01:43.720
<i>do not walk around
the lake at night.</i>

01:43.722 --> 01:46.926
<i>The mermaid is waiting there,
and as soon as you share</i>

01:46.928 --> 01:50.734
<i>your feelings of love with
her, she will stun you</i>

01:50.736 --> 01:54.844
<i>and she will tickle you,
dragging you to the bottom.</i>

01:57.549 --> 01:59.918
<i>And if you try to
resist her charms,</i>

01:59.920 --> 02:01.622
<i>you will not be forgiven.</i>

02:01.624 --> 02:03.927
<i>She will separate you
from the one you love.</i>

02:03.929 --> 02:08.803
<i>She will torture you until
your very last day on earth.</i>

02:08.805 --> 02:12.409
<i>You can only save
yourself if you give her</i>

02:12.411 --> 02:14.447
<i>your most precious thing.</i>

02:16.620 --> 02:20.729
<i>But the drowned woman has
never released anyone.</i>

02:22.499 --> 02:25.371
<i>Because they lost their
love, they perished.</i>

02:27.977 --> 02:31.818
<i>And now, you will
meet the same fate.</i>

02:49.820 --> 02:51.489
Misha.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.098
Stop this, please.

02:57.636 --> 03:00.040
Don't say a word, I beg you.

03:05.819 --> 03:06.886
Be silent.

03:06.888 --> 03:09.925
You hear me?
Be silent.

03:26.694 --> 03:28.062
Give him back, take me.

03:28.064 --> 03:30.168
Give him back, take me.

03:35.077 --> 03:36.614
Anya!

03:37.683 --> 03:41.223
Hurry!

03:46.734 --> 03:47.970
I'm sorry.

04:07.776 --> 04:09.177
She's here.

04:25.678 --> 04:27.847
Hand, give me your hand!

04:27.849 --> 04:29.251
Give me your hand!

05:00.416 --> 05:04.054
Knees together, point
your toes, that's good.

05:04.056 --> 05:06.125
Roma, tell
me about the house.

05:06.127 --> 05:07.160
Is it roomy?

05:07.162 --> 05:08.863
That's enough for today.

05:08.865 --> 05:10.132
Try not to be late tomorrow.

05:10.134 --> 05:12.438
When I was a kid,
it seemed kinda big.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.243
It's been 20 years
since I was last there.

05:15.245 --> 05:16.846
And it's for sale, anyway.

05:18.317 --> 05:19.885
So, we'll fix it up.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.755
Why, and do what with it?

05:21.757 --> 05:23.295
What do you mean?

05:24.195 --> 05:25.497
Live there.

05:28.104 --> 05:30.773
- All right, that's it.
- Hey!

05:30.775 --> 05:32.810
Come on now, try it, carefully.

05:32.812 --> 05:35.081
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Okay, now let go.

05:35.083 --> 05:38.189
- Let go, shh.
- No, no, Roma, it won't work!

05:38.191 --> 05:39.992
Come on, listen.

05:39.994 --> 05:42.265
Nothing works unless
you try it yourself.

05:43.868 --> 05:46.137
Trust the water,
it'll guide you.

05:46.139 --> 05:48.208
I don't want to trust it.

05:48.210 --> 05:49.913
Trust me then.

05:53.221 --> 05:56.961
Okay. Okay.

06:05.913 --> 06:07.482
Hold on, hold on.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.369
Swim away, dude.

06:19.172 --> 06:20.808
Hey, Marina, listen.

06:22.546 --> 06:24.484
I gotta borrow
your fiancÃ© today.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.852
Why is that?

06:26.854 --> 06:29.157
I'm arranging a
little entertainment

06:29.159 --> 06:31.596
to celebrate the untimely
demise of his bachelorhood.

06:31.598 --> 06:34.200
Ah, you are aware
that such things

06:34.202 --> 06:37.340
often lead to the cancellation
of the wedding, right?

06:37.342 --> 06:39.144
Ah, don't you worry.

06:39.146 --> 06:40.815
I'll bring your boy home safe.

06:43.020 --> 06:45.323
I'll come back alone.

06:45.325 --> 06:47.227
We do have qualifications soon.

06:48.163 --> 06:49.432
You wimpin' out?

06:49.434 --> 06:51.437
Not me, you're the
one in trouble.

06:52.505 --> 06:53.973
You won't be able to swim.

06:53.975 --> 06:57.180
I won't, huh?

06:57.182 --> 07:00.252
Well, Kitaev, sounds
like a challenge.

07:02.693 --> 07:03.927
I mean it.

07:03.929 --> 07:05.596
Race me two laps.

07:05.598 --> 07:08.202
Let's see who won't
reach the line.

07:08.204 --> 07:10.206
You're gonna lose.

07:10.208 --> 07:12.413
Enough talk, come
over and prove it.

07:15.218 --> 07:16.986
Okay, I'll be right back.

07:16.988 --> 07:18.555
Let go of the side.

07:18.557 --> 07:22.531
Be proud of yourself.

07:35.292 --> 07:38.431
I'll just, just trust it.

07:40.702 --> 07:42.539
Trust the water.

08:28.297 --> 08:31.568
Don't cry, you'll
get me next time.

08:40.388 --> 08:41.823
Breathe, just breathe.

08:41.825 --> 08:42.825
Look at me, everything's fine.

08:42.827 --> 08:43.760
Just breathe.

08:43.761 --> 08:46.866
Breathe.

09:09.279 --> 09:10.348
What's for dinner?

09:11.417 --> 09:12.451
Faucet broke again.

09:12.453 --> 09:13.555
Fix it, please.

09:17.462 --> 09:19.566
Are you still mad
about the pool?

09:20.869 --> 09:22.671
It was fine.
I got there in time.

09:22.673 --> 09:24.508
Roma, I can't swim.

09:24.510 --> 09:26.213
You promised to be around.

09:27.482 --> 09:29.684
I left you at the edge, right?

09:29.686 --> 09:30.823
What happened?

09:33.762 --> 09:34.995
So is she pissed at you?

09:34.997 --> 09:36.932
Yeah, it looks like it.

09:36.934 --> 09:38.337
Ah, whatever.

09:39.540 --> 09:41.910
She just freaked out a bit.

09:41.912 --> 09:43.380
She'll get over it.

09:45.351 --> 09:46.752
I shoulda stayed.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.456
Come on.

09:48.458 --> 09:50.460
The hell's that mean?

09:50.462 --> 09:52.363
We're already gone, so what?

09:52.365 --> 09:54.300
We'll see the house, chill out

09:54.302 --> 09:57.408
for a while, enjoy
some fresh air.

10:01.049 --> 10:02.784
Take it easy.

10:02.786 --> 10:04.788
I mean, it's normal to freak
out before the wedding.

10:04.790 --> 10:06.793
You worry, so does he.

10:06.795 --> 10:09.031
Where is he, by the way?

10:09.033 --> 10:11.402
- Who?
- Roma, silly.

10:11.404 --> 10:15.577
Probably
at the summer house.

10:15.579 --> 10:17.646
What summer house?

10:17.648 --> 10:20.553
Mm, the old one
your father gave us,

10:20.555 --> 10:23.493
you know, as a wedding gift.

10:23.495 --> 10:25.497
Wait, our father has shown up?

10:25.499 --> 10:26.799
Olga, don't move.

10:26.801 --> 10:28.535
I don't know.

10:28.537 --> 10:33.780
He sent the deed, the keys,
told us to sell it off.

10:33.782 --> 10:35.652
I would rather fix
it up, to be honest.

10:36.621 --> 10:37.656
Strange.

10:39.026 --> 10:40.526
What's strange?

10:40.528 --> 10:43.534
We haven't seen
him for 20 years.

11:04.442 --> 11:05.945
Wow, it's still a dump.

11:05.947 --> 11:08.450
I thought he sold it ages ago.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.989
What's wrong with him?

11:11.991 --> 11:13.860
Your father, I mean.

11:13.862 --> 11:15.630
Did you see the
lake around there?

11:15.632 --> 11:16.701
Yeah.

11:19.472 --> 11:20.943
It's where my mother drowned.

11:23.481 --> 11:26.552
Father went nuts because
of it, but I was a kid.

11:26.554 --> 11:27.787
I don't remember.

11:27.789 --> 11:29.893
I see.

11:29.895 --> 11:32.631
Olga and I were
at our grandparents'.

11:32.633 --> 11:33.966
I haven't seen him since.

11:33.968 --> 11:35.705
Damn, that sounds bad.

11:36.841 --> 11:39.645
Have you tried talking to him?

11:39.647 --> 11:41.783
- Who, my dad?
- Yeah.

11:41.785 --> 11:44.523
Give me some light.

11:46.928 --> 11:49.032
I don't even know him.
What can he tell me?

11:52.205 --> 11:53.807
About your mom, maybe.

12:24.837 --> 12:28.075
Kit, we have electricity
in this place?

12:28.077 --> 12:29.781
Check for a fuse box.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.089
A fuse box, he says.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.822
Ilya?

13:39.454 --> 13:41.990
Yeah, what you doing down here?

13:41.992 --> 13:43.194
Put the light down.

13:48.804 --> 13:49.873
Whoa!

13:52.980 --> 13:56.785
There must have been a flood.

13:56.787 --> 13:58.822
Need to clean the drain.

14:01.997 --> 14:03.500
- Yo!
- Hey, hey!

14:03.502 --> 14:05.205
- I think we're here, guys.
- Is this the place, man?

14:06.808 --> 14:08.509
This place
looks haunted as shit.

14:08.511 --> 14:10.179
- Come on, hurry up!
- What the hell is this, Ilya?

14:10.181 --> 14:10.880
What do you think?

14:10.882 --> 14:12.218
I told you we need to chill out.

14:12.220 --> 14:13.253
Come on, it's fine.

14:13.255 --> 14:15.356
- Yeah, yeah, come on in.
- I'm not in the mood.

14:15.358 --> 14:16.391
I know you're not.

14:16.393 --> 14:18.765
I'm fixing your mood.

14:20.201 --> 14:22.538
We used to tell fortunes
with my mom for fun.

14:22.540 --> 14:25.510
We'd look into two mirrors
opposite each other

14:25.512 --> 14:27.581
and see if we can
spot Mr. Right.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.017
Well, did you see him?

14:29.019 --> 14:30.353
Course not,
it's nonsense.

14:30.355 --> 14:32.524
What, burning your hair is not?

14:32.526 --> 14:34.495
I don't believe in
the Mr. Right thing,

14:34.497 --> 14:37.099
I do believe in
the power of hair,

14:37.101 --> 14:41.542
and one shouldn't leave
it behind, even here.

14:41.544 --> 14:43.045
Don't worry about Roma.

14:43.047 --> 14:44.214
You're a great couple.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.351
No need to fight, okay?

14:46.353 --> 14:47.523
Okay, bye.

15:33.047 --> 15:35.249
All right!

15:35.251 --> 15:37.456
Hey, guys, to the groom.

15:38.725 --> 15:40.627
Marina's a nice girl, of course.

15:40.629 --> 15:43.499
No, really, I mean it, but
this is a life sentence.

15:43.501 --> 15:45.436
Yeah.

15:45.438 --> 15:47.441
So, buddy, to
spend the last days

15:47.443 --> 15:49.009
of your bachelor
life to the fullest,

15:50.315 --> 15:55.289
from us to you,
we got you a present.

15:55.291 --> 15:56.726
Let's get this party started!

15:56.728 --> 15:59.097
Yeah, yeah, bring 'em in!

16:03.408 --> 16:04.742
Oh, ho, ho!

16:17.636 --> 16:19.137
Guys, thank you.

16:19.139 --> 16:21.408
No offense, okay,
you all have fun.

16:21.410 --> 16:23.278
I gotta take a walk.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.315
Ah, what?

16:24.317 --> 16:25.550
He's acting weird.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.090
- What happened?
- Come on, man.

19:54.503 --> 19:56.909
Do you love me?

20:32.612 --> 20:33.747
Roma!

20:33.749 --> 20:36.319
- Roma!
- Roma!

20:36.321 --> 20:37.821
- Kitaev!
- Roma!

20:37.823 --> 20:38.856
Kit, Kit!

20:38.858 --> 20:40.930
- Where you at?
- Roma!

20:42.032 --> 20:44.738
Kit, where are you?

20:45.973 --> 20:48.042
Kitaev!

20:48.044 --> 20:49.978
Roma, where are you?

20:49.980 --> 20:51.184
Kitaev!

20:54.023 --> 20:57.260
Rome, what are you
doing on the ground?

20:57.262 --> 20:59.298
Roma, what are
you doing on the ground?

20:59.300 --> 21:01.236
Guys, give me a hand.

21:01.238 --> 21:02.804
- Where's the girl?
- What girl?

21:02.806 --> 21:04.107
- All right, let's go.
- There was a girl here.

21:04.109 --> 21:05.811
Where is she?

21:05.813 --> 21:08.349
What friggin' girl?

21:35.205 --> 21:38.376
Been there for long?

21:38.378 --> 21:40.848
Long enough
to see these bloom.

22:28.478 --> 22:30.916
Your arms, Kitaev, your arms!

22:32.285 --> 22:35.859
Ulyanov, speed up,
longer oars, longer!

22:37.196 --> 22:39.565
Rodionov, how many
times do I need to say,

22:39.567 --> 22:42.337
keep your elbows underwater?

22:42.339 --> 22:43.974
What's going on, huh?

22:43.976 --> 22:45.276
Qualification's tomorrow.

22:45.278 --> 22:49.252
Rome, don't piss
away our hard work.

22:49.254 --> 22:51.088
Did something happen, Rome?

22:51.090 --> 22:53.192
Feel sick, got a fever, what?

22:53.194 --> 22:54.227
Didn't sleep well.

22:54.229 --> 22:57.233
Didn't sleep well.

22:57.235 --> 22:59.872
I'll be fine by tomorrow, coach.

22:59.874 --> 23:02.944
Uh-huh, first position.

23:02.946 --> 23:05.386
Keep swimming 'til
you get it right.

23:07.289 --> 23:10.861
Coach Nikolayevich, Marina and I

23:10.863 --> 23:14.034
were planning on
having dinner together.

23:14.036 --> 23:15.872
You could do that.

23:16.574 --> 23:17.574
Up to you.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.616
Are you feeling all right?

23:38.618 --> 23:40.420
I'm fine.

23:40.422 --> 23:42.458
Doesn't look like it.

23:42.460 --> 23:43.460
Everything's fine.

23:43.462 --> 23:44.565
You sure?

23:45.331 --> 23:46.501
Yeah, man.

25:44.938 --> 25:47.543
Do you love me?

26:34.671 --> 26:36.507
Marina, stop it.

26:40.883 --> 26:42.584
I'm not feeling very well.

26:44.725 --> 26:45.891
Enough already!

26:58.418 --> 27:02.023
I'll sue your damn
coach into the ground.

27:02.025 --> 27:06.702
He shouldn't have let you
swim when you're this sick.

27:08.037 --> 27:09.641
Here, drink it.

27:15.619 --> 27:17.487
Lie down.

27:17.489 --> 27:19.795
Come on, lie down, lie down.

27:25.806 --> 27:27.643
You're burning up.

27:32.052 --> 27:33.823
I don't love you.

27:34.724 --> 27:36.394
I don't love you.

27:37.462 --> 27:38.763
<i>How is he feeling?</i>

27:38.765 --> 27:42.470
Looks better, I guess, asleep.

27:42.472 --> 27:43.642
<i>Good.</i>

27:44.878 --> 27:49.117
<i>I was wondering, though,</i>

27:49.119 --> 27:51.488
<i>why do you need to
fix the place up?</i>

27:51.490 --> 27:53.059
<i>I mean, you can find
an agent and sell it.</i>

27:53.061 --> 27:54.929
<i>Easier for everyone,
don't you think?</i>

27:54.931 --> 27:58.436
I don't know. I'd have to
discuss it with Roma first.

27:58.438 --> 28:00.709
<i>Had another fight?</i>

28:01.577 --> 28:02.679
No, no.

28:04.783 --> 28:10.528
Just, um, he's acting strange.

28:12.032 --> 28:14.468
Maybe he met someone.

28:14.470 --> 28:15.570
<i>No way.</i>

28:15.572 --> 28:17.476
I found something.

28:23.488 --> 28:24.688
- Look.
- <i>Looks like junk.</i>

28:24.690 --> 28:26.128
<i>Hold it closer.</i>

28:28.065 --> 28:29.564
<i>Did you ask where it came from?</i>

28:29.566 --> 28:31.035
Mm-mm.

28:31.037 --> 28:32.237
<i>See, you're
winding yourself up.</i>

28:32.239 --> 28:33.239
<i>Go get some rest.</i>

28:33.241 --> 28:34.876
<i>It'll be okay.</i>

28:34.878 --> 28:36.078
Thanks, Olga.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.514
<i>Bye.</i>

28:37.516 --> 28:39.887
See ya.

29:52.666 --> 29:53.836
Rome?

31:00.869 --> 31:02.907
Quiet, be quiet.

31:04.444 --> 31:08.350
Just a dream,
it was just a bad dream.

31:08.352 --> 31:09.854
Shh.

31:18.238 --> 31:19.606
He's got a nice speed.

31:19.608 --> 31:20.941
It's impressive.

31:20.943 --> 31:22.512
<i>This race is over.</i>

31:22.514 --> 31:28.857
<i>Attention, please, Kitaev,
Rodionov, get ready.</i>

31:28.859 --> 31:30.494
Okay, guys, keep your speed.

31:30.496 --> 31:31.562
Remember the technique.

31:31.564 --> 31:33.601
Ilya, elbows.

31:33.603 --> 31:35.906
Roma, like yesterday.

31:38.612 --> 31:40.883
Now, go on, good luck.

31:45.392 --> 31:48.631
- Pass me a water.
- Yeah, sure, which one?

31:48.633 --> 31:50.502
Thank you.

33:33.308 --> 33:36.381
Do you love me?

33:39.754 --> 33:42.092
No, no, no.

33:52.179 --> 33:54.481
Help, need
some help over here.

33:54.483 --> 33:55.785
Hey, what happened?

33:55.787 --> 33:57.387
What's wrong, is he all right?

33:57.389 --> 34:00.192
Just breathe,
okay, just breathe.

34:00.194 --> 34:02.197
We got you, come on.

34:02.199 --> 34:04.234
Wake up. It's gonna be all
right, just hang on.

34:04.236 --> 34:06.873
- Come on, all right?
- Breathe.

34:08.311 --> 34:13.487
There was a young girl,
barely a teenager.

34:16.728 --> 34:19.364
I can't shake the
feeling she's around.

34:19.367 --> 34:24.645
Every time I close my
eyes, I see her face.

34:26.782 --> 34:28.685
What face?

34:30.757 --> 34:33.159
She's like a wild animal.

34:38.505 --> 34:42.346
Roma, the doctor says
you got dehydrated.

34:45.987 --> 34:49.591
You just need to sleep it off.

34:49.592 --> 34:51.728
You're tired.

34:51.731 --> 34:53.969
No, that's not the point.

34:57.844 --> 34:59.913
Tell us more, Roma.

34:59.915 --> 35:02.519
Where did you first see her?

35:09.634 --> 35:10.970
On the lake.

35:13.876 --> 35:16.247
She was wearing my shirt.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.886
I was drawn to her.

35:19.888 --> 35:21.023
He's delirious.

35:22.092 --> 35:23.894
There was nobody there.

35:23.896 --> 35:27.068
I swear I couldn't help myself.

35:27.070 --> 35:31.277
We kissed, and I felt
like I couldn't breathe.

35:32.781 --> 35:34.816
- Rome.
- Marina, I'm sorry.

35:34.818 --> 35:35.985
I just couldn't help myself.

35:35.987 --> 35:36.987
Please, Marina!

35:45.105 --> 35:46.673
Roma, listen to me.

35:46.675 --> 35:47.875
What else do you remember?

35:47.877 --> 35:50.848
- What did she look like?
- Okay, hold on.

35:50.850 --> 35:53.055
Roma, come back!

35:57.062 --> 35:58.064
Marina.

36:03.675 --> 36:06.581
Marina, Marina!

36:07.750 --> 36:12.727
<i>He doesn't need you.</i>

36:37.243 --> 36:38.578
Marina?

37:12.847 --> 37:14.049
Marina.

37:17.290 --> 37:20.763
Roma, what's wrong?

37:28.345 --> 37:30.282
Rome!

37:34.223 --> 37:37.196
Somebody, please,
we need some help!

37:41.604 --> 37:42.705
Hurry!

37:45.078 --> 37:46.180
Roma!

37:48.184 --> 37:51.022
Kit, Kit, open up!

37:51.024 --> 37:52.592
Roma!

38:26.962 --> 38:28.729
He doesn't look good.

38:28.731 --> 38:29.832
He's on death's door.

38:29.834 --> 38:31.972
Should we take him back?

38:35.245 --> 38:38.719
We have to go and meet
with someone first.

38:48.204 --> 38:50.140
Hello, Dad.

38:54.083 --> 38:55.851
You gave Roma the house.

38:55.853 --> 38:57.922
Why?

38:57.924 --> 38:59.493
You shouldn't
have come here.

38:59.495 --> 39:01.229
I'm sick.

39:01.231 --> 39:02.999
Roma saw the girl on the lake.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.016
With the long hair.

39:13.789 --> 39:17.998
She took his shirt,
and now he's ill.

39:24.545 --> 39:28.953
That's impossible.
She died a long time ago.

39:31.191 --> 39:34.129
Do you recognize this?

39:39.274 --> 39:40.340
No, I don't.

39:40.342 --> 39:42.044
Now, leave.

39:44.917 --> 39:48.624
Father, what exactly
happened 20 years ago?

39:48.626 --> 39:50.260
- Olga.
- Speak up now!

39:50.262 --> 39:52.131
- Olga!
- How did Mom die?

39:52.133 --> 39:53.901
- Olga, that's enough!
- Your son may be next.

39:53.903 --> 39:55.170
Leave me be!

39:55.172 --> 39:56.306
I'm begging you, please!

39:56.308 --> 39:57.609
- Tell us!
- Stop it, get out!

39:57.611 --> 39:59.210
You can't
hide your whole life.

39:59.212 --> 40:01.550
She drowned, all right!

40:01.552 --> 40:02.920
She drowned!

40:07.229 --> 40:08.432
Dad.

40:17.984 --> 40:22.291
You... don't talk to her.

40:22.293 --> 40:25.163
- Don't you dare talk to her!
- Who?

40:25.165 --> 40:28.169
She'll take you away!

40:28.171 --> 40:32.581
Don't you, don't
you dare!

40:39.327 --> 40:41.562
<i>I met her on the lake.</i>

40:41.564 --> 40:43.634
<i>She asked if I loved her.</i>

40:43.636 --> 40:47.609
<i>I didn't answer,
so she kept coming back,</i>

40:47.611 --> 40:50.382
torturing me the entire time.

40:51.484 --> 40:55.390
I couldn't escape from her.

40:55.392 --> 41:00.302
Your mother, she somehow
found a way to get rid of her.

41:03.408 --> 41:07.649
<i>I called her by her name,
but it didn't work,</i>

41:07.651 --> 41:09.385
and she took your mother away.

41:12.461 --> 41:13.727
She never came back.

41:15.499 --> 41:20.710
From that day, everything lost
its meaning, everything but her.

41:22.279 --> 41:25.117
I think about her
every single day.

41:26.789 --> 41:32.166
Not your mom, but her.

41:34.237 --> 41:39.646
I see her hair, her eyes.

41:39.648 --> 41:41.616
I can never forget her.

41:43.088 --> 41:45.793
What did Mom
do specifically?

41:53.241 --> 41:55.277
Not sure.

41:55.279 --> 42:00.356
Under the old dock, she found
something under the water.

42:09.240 --> 42:12.211
Except it won't
help you, my son.

42:14.250 --> 42:15.820
She will drive you mad.

42:18.358 --> 42:20.293
Let's go
to this damn lake.

42:20.295 --> 42:22.197
We need to know what
your mother did.

42:53.797 --> 42:55.867
Sit, sit, sit.

42:59.441 --> 43:00.843
Everything okay?

43:11.832 --> 43:16.340
It's been 20 years,
but nothing here has changed.

43:31.772 --> 43:34.709
Marina, you're not
mad at Kitaev, are you?

43:34.711 --> 43:36.480
He was out of his mind,
you know.

43:36.482 --> 43:38.450
None of your business,
get in the water.

43:38.452 --> 43:40.054
Everything'll be fine.

43:40.056 --> 43:42.491
Stay with Roma, please.

43:42.493 --> 43:43.660
Hey, swimmer boy, come with me.

43:43.662 --> 43:45.430
So, what, are you in charge now?

43:45.432 --> 43:47.337
Come on, we can't
do it without you.

43:50.375 --> 43:51.812
Don't be scared.

44:08.045 --> 44:09.915
Please forgive me.

44:14.157 --> 44:16.360
We can deal with this.

44:18.498 --> 44:20.870
We'll sort it out together.

44:31.792 --> 44:35.132
Let me
get you some water.

44:48.057 --> 44:51.196
Right here's where I found
him, with the comb next to him.

44:51.198 --> 44:52.700
Mm-hmm.

44:59.781 --> 45:02.654
Take your clothes off.
You need to dive in.

45:08.198 --> 45:09.265
Shit.

46:13.396 --> 46:15.097
Got it!

47:36.429 --> 47:37.495
Ilya!

47:40.503 --> 47:41.973
Ilya!

47:46.014 --> 47:47.216
Ilya!

48:14.571 --> 48:17.408
Lisa.

48:17.410 --> 48:21.583
Lisa Grigorieva's
her name.

49:05.372 --> 49:07.207
<i>Take what's yours.</i>

49:07.209 --> 49:08.510
<i>Give me the loved one.</i>

49:15.427 --> 49:17.027
<i>Take what's yours.</i>

49:17.029 --> 49:18.666
<i>Give me the loved one.</i>

49:21.037 --> 49:23.641
<i>Take what's yours.</i>

49:23.643 --> 49:26.447
<i>Give me the loved one.</i>

49:26.449 --> 49:27.682
<i>Take what's yours.</i>

49:27.684 --> 49:29.686
<i>Give me the loved one.</i>

49:29.688 --> 49:31.022
Take.

49:42.446 --> 49:43.647
<i>Give me the loved one.</i>

49:43.649 --> 49:44.784
<i>Take what's yours.</i>

49:44.786 --> 49:46.285
<i>Give me the loved one.</i>

49:46.287 --> 49:47.355
<i>Take what's yours.</i>

49:47.357 --> 49:48.557
<i>Give me the loved one.</i>

49:48.559 --> 49:49.626
<i>Take what's yours.</i>

49:49.628 --> 49:51.295
<i>Give me the loved one!</i>

50:01.418 --> 50:03.219
Give me the loved one!

50:12.240 --> 50:13.809
Roma!

50:18.118 --> 50:19.153
Rome.

50:23.429 --> 50:24.665
Roma.

50:32.882 --> 50:34.116
Rome.

50:42.802 --> 50:44.170
I saw her.

50:46.475 --> 50:47.644
Who?

50:50.783 --> 50:52.186
Your mother.

51:02.774 --> 51:03.774
Rome!

51:06.314 --> 51:07.280
Roma!

51:52.841 --> 51:54.810
Drink this.

51:54.812 --> 51:56.582
You'll feel better.

52:01.325 --> 52:05.564
Maybe it's all about the comb.

52:05.566 --> 52:09.739
LG, Lisa Grigorieva.

52:12.080 --> 52:14.949
Lisa.

52:14.951 --> 52:16.021
Suicide.

52:17.657 --> 52:20.062
What makes you think
she committed suicide?

52:21.665 --> 52:24.602
Suicide victims weren't
buried in cemeteries.

52:24.604 --> 52:27.041
So, what, they buried
her in the lake?

52:27.043 --> 52:28.945
On the shore.

52:28.947 --> 52:32.953
The lake spilled over
when the dam was built.

52:32.955 --> 52:36.927
Well, what should we do?

52:36.929 --> 52:39.568
This has to be it.

52:40.904 --> 52:42.940
We shouldn't have
taken her comb.

52:42.942 --> 52:47.915
"Take what's yours and
give me the loved one."

52:47.917 --> 52:50.055
You were saying that
power's in the hair.

52:53.128 --> 52:54.763
Could the comb be it?

52:54.765 --> 52:58.604
Your mom was performing
a ritual in the bath.

52:58.606 --> 53:00.808
What do you think?

53:00.810 --> 53:02.879
Ritual?

53:02.881 --> 53:05.787
Well, it didn't work
for her, not an option.

53:07.590 --> 53:09.626
What else is there?

53:09.628 --> 53:10.929
I say we get out of here.

53:10.931 --> 53:13.667
No, she'll find him anywhere.

53:13.669 --> 53:15.072
We need to fight.

53:23.822 --> 53:25.193
What is it, Rome?

53:26.995 --> 53:29.034
Rome, what happened?

53:33.777 --> 53:35.110
Are you cold?

53:35.112 --> 53:37.782
Can I get you a blanket?

53:37.784 --> 53:39.819
Marina.

53:39.821 --> 53:42.593
There's nobody under there.

54:08.045 --> 54:08.945
We have to do something.

54:08.947 --> 54:11.551
I'm trying the ritual.

54:20.036 --> 54:22.740
Do me a favor and stay here.

54:24.644 --> 54:26.047
Are you sure?

54:28.018 --> 54:29.654
Yeah.

54:30.724 --> 54:33.126
Scream if something goes wrong.

54:33.128 --> 54:34.164
I'm here.

55:14.711 --> 55:17.014
Lisa Grigorieva.

55:17.016 --> 55:18.685
Take what's yours.

55:19.454 --> 55:21.122
Give me the loved one.

55:37.757 --> 55:40.295
<i>When I was a kid,
I had a dream.</i>

55:44.037 --> 55:46.172
I'm in the house, alone.

55:46.174 --> 55:49.513
Parents are out.

55:49.515 --> 55:53.255
And then suddenly, I
hear someone outside.

55:55.927 --> 55:59.868
<i>He says, "Open the door,"
but I don't open it.</i>

56:03.943 --> 56:07.450
<i>And the door slowly
opens, all by itself.</i>

56:11.057 --> 56:12.993
<i>Hinges creak.</i>

56:12.995 --> 56:15.032
The deadbolt turns.

56:17.136 --> 56:21.111
Somehow, I'm on my
way to open the door.

56:23.916 --> 56:26.122
Mom is standing there.

56:29.193 --> 56:32.064
She looks at me and whispers,

56:32.066 --> 56:37.442
"I'm taking the one who's
home alone, the one you love"

56:37.444 --> 56:39.013
<i>And I'm scared.</i>

57:05.633 --> 57:08.238
Do you love me?

57:14.585 --> 57:16.152
I do.

57:22.534 --> 57:25.070
Did you hear that?

57:25.072 --> 57:26.275
Roma?

57:27.577 --> 57:29.046
Roma.

57:30.483 --> 57:32.384
What are you doing?

57:32.386 --> 57:33.587
Take me.

57:33.589 --> 57:35.023
Roma.

57:35.025 --> 57:36.527
I can't
bear this anymore.

57:36.529 --> 57:38.130
Take me.

57:38.132 --> 57:39.435
Roma!

57:40.503 --> 57:41.603
What are you doing?

57:41.605 --> 57:43.173
- Enough.
- I can't bear it.

57:43.175 --> 57:46.145
- That's enough!
- I can't do this anymore.

58:06.120 --> 58:08.289
Lisa Grigorieva,
take what's yours

58:08.291 --> 58:10.463
and give me the loved one.

58:23.154 --> 58:25.658
<i>We used to tell
fortunes with my mom for fun.</i>

58:25.660 --> 58:27.862
<i>We'd look into two mirrors
opposite each other</i>

58:27.864 --> 58:31.137
<i>and see if we can
spot Mr. Right.</i>

58:57.289 --> 59:00.829
Lisa Grigorieva,
take what's yours

59:00.831 --> 59:02.432
and give me the loved one.

59:34.832 --> 59:36.767
Do you love me?

59:36.769 --> 59:38.606
More than life itself.

59:54.772 --> 59:55.808
Look who's here.

59:58.680 --> 59:59.749
No, no, go.

01:00:01.752 --> 01:00:04.422
You said you loved
me more than life itself.

01:00:10.536 --> 01:00:12.572
Go away.

01:00:12.574 --> 01:00:14.509
<i>He doesn't love you.</i>

01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:17.650
<i>Go away, go away,
go away, go away!</i>

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.964
Murderer!

01:00:24.966 --> 01:00:26.602
<i>Murderer!</i>

01:00:56.028 --> 01:00:57.498
Quiet, shh.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:00:59.735
Quiet.

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.342
Marina.

01:01:04.477 --> 01:01:06.446
Marina, Marina.

01:01:41.585 --> 01:01:44.556
Marina.

01:01:45.928 --> 01:01:51.105
Marina.

01:02:02.593 --> 01:02:04.098
Do you love me?

01:02:12.982 --> 01:02:14.015
Do you love me?

01:02:14.986 --> 01:02:16.619
And me?

01:02:16.621 --> 01:02:18.791
How 'bout me?

01:02:18.793 --> 01:02:21.129
Do you love me?

01:02:21.131 --> 01:02:22.801
- And me?
- And me?

01:02:24.137 --> 01:02:25.506
Choose me.

01:02:26.575 --> 01:02:27.976
Choose me.

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:29.813
Choose me.

01:02:29.815 --> 01:02:31.051
Choose me.

01:02:31.986 --> 01:02:33.122
Choose me.

01:02:34.157 --> 01:02:35.259
Choose me.

01:02:40.871 --> 01:02:42.106
I love you.

01:03:21.452 --> 01:03:23.188
I think it worked.

01:03:24.458 --> 01:03:25.794
She took the comb.

01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:29.201
Not going to rain today.

01:03:50.477 --> 01:03:54.185
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

01:03:58.426 --> 01:04:00.196
Get in, we're leaving.

01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:18.199
Ready?

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:26.882
Your mother was beautiful.

01:04:29.355 --> 01:04:31.359
Let's get out of here.

01:04:51.265 --> 01:04:54.236
I do love you.

01:04:56.241 --> 01:04:59.147
I do love you.

01:05:02.554 --> 01:05:04.591
I do love you.

01:05:09.233 --> 01:05:11.437
Where is Ilya?

01:05:11.439 --> 01:05:12.574
He followed you.

01:05:17.384 --> 01:05:18.617
Here.

01:05:18.619 --> 01:05:21.257
Get in, I'll be right back.

01:05:30.543 --> 01:05:31.912
Yo!

01:05:49.248 --> 01:05:50.450
Ilya.

01:06:26.823 --> 01:06:30.028
<i>I'll take
everyone you love.</i>

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:46.027
Roma!

01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:48.497
Roma, hold on!

01:06:48.499 --> 01:06:53.808
Hold on to me!

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:55.045
Let's go!

01:07:17.457 --> 01:07:18.424
Where's Ilya?

01:07:18.426 --> 01:07:20.598
She got to him.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.766
What the?

01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:41.338
Come on.

01:07:44.244 --> 01:07:45.346
Son of a...

01:07:51.893 --> 01:07:53.930
- Roma!
- Wait a sec.

01:08:17.877 --> 01:08:20.413
Rome, Roma, Roma!

01:08:20.416 --> 01:08:21.884
Roma, she's here!

01:08:21.886 --> 01:08:22.986
Roma!

01:08:22.988 --> 01:08:25.792
Rome!

01:08:38.419 --> 01:08:39.452
What?

01:08:39.453 --> 01:08:40.453
Rome!

01:09:41.947 --> 01:09:44.216
We gave the comb back.

01:09:44.218 --> 01:09:45.986
- We gave the comb back.
- We were wrong.

01:09:45.988 --> 01:09:47.456
It's not about the comb.

01:09:47.457 --> 01:09:49.060
She needs something else.

01:09:57.645 --> 01:09:59.080
She needs me.

01:10:04.724 --> 01:10:08.665
No... Rome!

01:10:15.646 --> 01:10:16.815
Don't do it!

01:10:17.717 --> 01:10:18.920
Stop!

01:10:23.062 --> 01:10:27.568
Rome, Roma!

01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:28.237
Rome!

01:10:56.028 --> 01:10:58.165
Do you love me?

01:11:03.043 --> 01:11:04.143
I do.

01:11:04.145 --> 01:11:05.313
No!

01:11:07.951 --> 01:11:09.154
You love her!

01:11:39.248 --> 01:11:42.819
Lisa Grigorieva, take the bride.

01:11:42.821 --> 01:11:44.323
Give my brother back.

01:11:46.929 --> 01:11:50.067
Lisa Grigorieva, take the bride.

01:11:50.069 --> 01:11:52.174
Give my brother back.

01:11:57.351 --> 01:12:00.189
Lisa Grigorieva, take the bride.

01:12:02.059 --> 01:12:04.031
Give my brother back.

01:12:08.773 --> 01:12:10.107
Olga.

01:12:10.109 --> 01:12:13.381
Lisa Grigorieva, take the bride.

01:12:13.383 --> 01:12:15.018
Give my brother back.

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.222
What's wrong with you?

01:12:23.437 --> 01:12:25.240
She can't be killed, see?

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.311
She can't.

01:12:28.413 --> 01:12:30.150
It's a life for a life.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:37.364
Mom gave hers for Dad,
so you give yours for Roma.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.301
Sorry.

01:12:40.303 --> 01:12:46.045
Olga, Olga, please,
untie me.

01:12:46.047 --> 01:12:48.149
- Olga, Olga.
- Lisa Grigorieva.

01:12:48.151 --> 01:12:50.188
- Take the bride.
- Please, I'm begging you.

01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:52.092
Give my brother back.

01:13:04.151 --> 01:13:06.553
Olga, Olga, please, untie me.

01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:09.326
I'm begging you, don't do this!

01:13:09.328 --> 01:13:12.231
Lisa Grigorieva,
take the bride!

01:13:12.233 --> 01:13:13.504
Give my brother back.

01:13:15.073 --> 01:13:17.609
Let me out of here!

01:13:17.611 --> 01:13:19.479
You have to!

01:13:21.553 --> 01:13:24.526
Lisa Grigorieva, take the bride.

01:13:28.934 --> 01:13:30.036
Olga!

01:13:35.012 --> 01:13:36.315
This will not work.

01:13:38.687 --> 01:13:40.557
Your mother
volunteered her life.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.194
It can't be forced.

01:13:43.196 --> 01:13:45.200
Get the hell back!

01:13:53.683 --> 01:13:56.355
We can only feed
her with our love.

01:13:58.158 --> 01:14:00.930
And then she turns
it into hatred.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.675
Agony.

01:14:09.982 --> 01:14:12.052
She wants us to suffer.

01:14:17.063 --> 01:14:18.166
I was weak.

01:14:19.301 --> 01:14:20.403
You are strong.

01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:24.446
You're stronger than
any of us, dear.

01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:30.457
You have your mother's
eyes, same eyes.

01:14:32.494 --> 01:14:34.464
I won't leave Roma.

01:14:34.466 --> 01:14:36.336
I won't leave him.

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.510
You don't have to.

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:58.447
We'll find a way out, dear.

01:14:59.616 --> 01:15:01.283
Forgive me.

01:15:01.285 --> 01:15:02.354
Forgive me.

01:15:03.289 --> 01:15:04.322
Forgive me.

01:15:10.404 --> 01:15:11.673
Dad.

01:15:12.742 --> 01:15:13.810
Dad!

01:15:33.483 --> 01:15:36.588
I haven't seen you for so long.

01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:38.092
Take me.

01:15:39.929 --> 01:15:41.498
Leave them alone.

01:15:45.808 --> 01:15:47.176
No, Dad.

01:15:50.283 --> 01:15:51.820
I still love you.

01:16:07.652 --> 01:16:12.626
Dad!

01:16:47.364 --> 01:16:48.734
Dad, Dad, please!

01:17:08.506 --> 01:17:10.075
Rome, Roma!

01:17:28.546 --> 01:17:31.416
We were wrong.

01:17:31.418 --> 01:17:32.518
It's not about the comb.

01:17:33.523 --> 01:17:36.494
Rome, her power is in her hair.

01:17:36.496 --> 01:17:38.030
You need to cut it off,
do you hear me?

01:17:38.032 --> 01:17:39.502
Just cut off her hair!

01:17:41.505 --> 01:17:42.640
Rome, Rome!

01:17:48.954 --> 01:17:50.624
Rome, Rome, Rome!

01:18:00.811 --> 01:18:02.713
<i>A life for a life.</i>

01:18:02.715 --> 01:18:03.985
<i>Mom gave hers for Dad.</i>

01:18:13.002 --> 01:18:14.737
Give him back.

01:18:14.739 --> 01:18:17.541
Take me.

01:19:44.785 --> 01:19:46.355
Do you love me?

01:20:09.468 --> 01:20:10.837
Of course.

01:21:31.565 --> 01:21:34.439
Hey!

01:21:36.443 --> 01:21:37.976
Wake up.

01:21:37.978 --> 01:21:39.913
Wake up!

01:21:39.915 --> 01:21:43.924
No!

01:21:48.567 --> 01:21:50.569
Please, I made it!

01:21:50.571 --> 01:21:52.973
Please, I made it in time!

01:21:52.975 --> 01:21:54.144
Wake up!

01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:01.055
Please, I made it in time!

01:22:01.057 --> 01:22:05.467
Breathe!
