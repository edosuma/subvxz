00:59.184 --> 01:00.853
What's the matter?

01:00.895 --> 01:03.271
Oh, come on, it'll be fine.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.065
Our new house.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.086
Wanna go see your room?

01:28.547 --> 01:30.257
What do you mean?
Why not?

01:30.298 --> 01:33.301
I just like
our last home better.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.725
It's the movers.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.268
Go inside, okay, babe?

01:42.561 --> 01:43.729
Hello?

01:43.771 --> 01:45.647
Hey, is this
Maggie Richards?

01:45.689 --> 01:47.315
This is she.

01:47.357 --> 01:50.986
What? We were expecting
the truck this afternoon.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.489
That is completely unacceptable.

01:54.531 --> 01:58.243
I refer a lot of business
to you guys.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.079
Yeah, well,
I'm disappointed too.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.878
Hey.

02:09.336 --> 02:11.131
So the movers
can't deliver

02:11.172 --> 02:13.592
the rest of our things
until tomorrow.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.720
So how 'bout we camp out
in here tonight?

02:16.762 --> 02:18.764
Yeah? Okay.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.849
Why don't you go play a game
or watch a movie on your tablet

02:20.891 --> 02:22.684
and I'll go unload some boxes?

02:22.726 --> 02:24.269
Okay, go.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.219
-I'm gonna jump!
-Oh, no, please don't.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.222
You'll get hurt.
Please don't do that.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.015
It's grass, a grass landing.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.266
-No.
-One!

04:26.307 --> 04:27.392
-No.
-Two!

04:27.434 --> 04:28.936
She's right, Ava.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.270
Oh!

04:30.311 --> 04:31.813
That's enough for now.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.399
Oh, boy.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.235
Hi, I'm Sylvia.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.444
I live across the street.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.820
-Maggie.
-Hi.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.073
Well, I was passing
by when she--

04:41.115 --> 04:43.283
-I needed a push.
-She needed a push.

04:43.324 --> 04:46.078
So I hope it's okay
that I came in.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.996
Of course.
We're neighbors.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.706
-Yes.
-Thanks for the push.

04:49.748 --> 04:50.874
You're welcome.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.667
Aw.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.211
Thanks.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.754
She always aims to be on the go.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.005
They usually are
at that age.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.548
-Yeah.
-So,

04:58.590 --> 05:01.218
are you
getting settled?

05:01.260 --> 05:03.095
Slowly, yeah.

05:03.137 --> 05:06.848
Well, you couldn't have
chosen a nicer neighborhood.

05:06.890 --> 05:10.269
I've lived here for years.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.896
The faces seem to change.

05:12.938 --> 05:16.233
The warm atmosphere doesn't.

05:16.275 --> 05:19.486
I am sure that you two
are gonna be happy here

05:19.527 --> 05:21.280
-for a lot of years.
-Oh, I don't know

05:21.321 --> 05:22.363
how long we're gonna be here.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.074
Maybe just a few months.

05:24.116 --> 05:26.160
-Oh.
-I flip houses.

05:26.201 --> 05:29.913
Well, now that we've met,
you're leaving.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.540
Yeah, well, I used
to just do it on the side,

05:32.582 --> 05:33.834
but now...

05:35.877 --> 05:38.505
My husband and I
just separated.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.008
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.550
Yeah.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.511
It is what it is.

05:44.552 --> 05:45.887
But anyway,
I can't believe

05:45.929 --> 05:47.514
how long this place
sat on the market.

05:47.555 --> 05:50.267
I know, well,
from what I understood,

05:50.309 --> 05:52.686
it was family entanglements.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.438
So if you're flipping it,
do you have big plans?

05:55.480 --> 05:58.066
I mean, major renovations?

05:58.108 --> 05:58.900
-Mom!
-Well--

05:58.942 --> 06:00.485
Oh!

06:00.527 --> 06:01.862
I gotta go
make sure she hasn't

06:01.903 --> 06:03.362
gotten herself
into any trouble.

06:03.404 --> 06:04.781
Go, go.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.241
It's very nice meeting you.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.701
You too,
I'll see you around.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.911
Okay.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.246
Hm.

06:24.551 --> 06:28.471
Is someone
ready for lunch?

06:28.513 --> 06:31.892
Oh, now what's wrong?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.977
I was only gone a minute.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.146
Were you afraid I had left

06:36.188 --> 06:39.358
and I wasn't coming back?

06:39.398 --> 06:40.859
You don't have
to worry about that.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.736
You know that'll
never happen

06:42.777 --> 06:46.114
'cause what would you do
without me, huh?

06:56.415 --> 07:00.295
The princess was trapped
against the castle walls

07:00.337 --> 07:04.341
and then a dragon swooped down
to kill the princess,

07:04.383 --> 07:09.346
but the prince rose up
and slayed the dragon.

07:09.388 --> 07:12.057
Really?

07:12.099 --> 07:15.269
Was what he told everyone,

07:15.310 --> 07:18.479
but really it was the princess
who took the prince's sword

07:18.521 --> 07:21.733
and killed the dragon,
saving the kingdom.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.817
I like that.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.362
But why would the princess

07:25.404 --> 07:26.905
let the prince take credit

07:26.947 --> 07:29.283
for something she did?

07:29.324 --> 07:32.911
Mm, that's the way
things were back then.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.789
But eventually the princess
grew tired of it,

07:35.830 --> 07:37.207
so she broke off
from his kingdom

07:37.249 --> 07:39.418
and started
one of her own.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.087
Are you talking
about you and Dad?

07:45.757 --> 07:48.593
Your dad and I...

07:48.635 --> 07:52.306
No matter what happens
between him and me,

07:52.347 --> 07:55.558
all you need to know
is that we both love you

07:55.600 --> 07:58.770
and we will always try to do
what's best for you.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.815
Don't you still love him?

08:01.856 --> 08:03.858
I'll always
have love for your dad.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.238
What do you say
we get some shut-eye?

08:08.280 --> 08:10.073
Lots to do tomorrow.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.366
Yeah? Okay.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.505
Hello?

09:11.885 --> 09:14.595
Okay, time to get you to bed.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.227
Night-night, baby.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.520
Love you.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.151
I'm sorry.
I'm--I'm really sorry.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.486
What are you
doing in here?

10:11.528 --> 10:12.987
I thought
this house was empty.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.573
-I heard it would be empty.
-And when it wasn't,

10:14.614 --> 10:15.865
what, you tried to scare me

10:15.907 --> 10:17.534
closing all the windows,
locking the doors?

10:17.576 --> 10:20.537
What? No, no,
I--I just came in.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.747
I'll leave, okay,
I'm leaving.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.128
Okay?

10:30.171 --> 10:31.256
Get the hell
out of here.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.091
This--this door
was unlocked.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.552
-I'm calling the police.
-What? No, no, no.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.387
You don't need to do that,
I just needed a place to crash.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.139
-Okay, okay, okay.
-I swear to God,

10:39.180 --> 10:40.807
-I wasn't gonna hurt you.
-Out the front door.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.100
Let's just talk
for a second, okay?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.643
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

10:43.684 --> 10:46.771
Why don't we like have
a drink or something?

10:46.813 --> 10:48.148
What are you doing with that?

10:48.189 --> 10:50.317
-Hey!
-Keep walking.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.240
You don't want to just talk
for a minute, have that drink?

10:57.282 --> 10:59.659
No, I think
you need to go.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.953
No conversation?

11:01.995 --> 11:03.663
Okay.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.039
Okay.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.917
Let me know
if you ever want to talk.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.085
Get out!

11:22.056 --> 11:23.141
-Ah.
-Hi.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.934
Well, hello there.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.603
-How are you?
-Um...

11:26.645 --> 11:29.230
Is everything okay?

11:29.272 --> 11:32.484
Have you seen anyone
sneaking around our place?

11:32.526 --> 11:35.529
No, no, I haven't
seen anyone today.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.615
Yesterday
or before we moved in?

11:38.657 --> 11:42.327
I'm sorry, my husband
is taking his afternoon nap.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.329
-Sorry.
-Oh, that's all right.

11:45.497 --> 11:49.042
So, uh, what is it?

11:49.083 --> 11:52.128
Windows seem to open
and close on their own.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.506
Doors lock and unlock.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.509
At first I thought
it was this squatter, but...

11:57.551 --> 11:59.927
Oh, my God,
there was a squatter.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.846
Other flippers
I know have experienced

12:01.888 --> 12:03.682
these kinds of things
and they usually

12:03.722 --> 12:05.600
blame it on
the property's history,

12:05.642 --> 12:09.396
but I always thought that
was crazy voodoo talk.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.316
You said you've been here
for many years, right?

12:13.358 --> 12:15.860
Just for
my own peace of mind,

12:15.902 --> 12:17.487
is there any history
on that house

12:17.529 --> 12:18.863
that I should know about?

12:18.905 --> 12:20.532
There's nothing
in the disclosures

12:20.574 --> 12:25.119
that would be a red flag,
like someone dying in the home.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.080
Oh...

12:27.121 --> 12:29.165
No, no.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.958
Not the last owners.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.294
No one died in there.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.714
As far as I know.

12:35.754 --> 12:39.884
What about
the other owners before them?

12:39.926 --> 12:42.721
Oh...

12:42.761 --> 12:45.599
-Let's walk.
-Sure.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.393
Veronica
and Henry Thomas.

12:48.435 --> 12:52.021
Bought the house,
fixed it up in the '70s.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.025
It was their dream home.

12:56.067 --> 12:59.946
And soon after,
their baby daughter was born.

12:59.987 --> 13:03.742
How they doted
on that precious girl.

13:03.782 --> 13:06.494
She was the light
of their life.

13:06.536 --> 13:09.080
So, what happened?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.040
Somebody took her.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.418
-I'm sorry?
-Yes, snatched.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.295
Ripped from their lives

13:15.336 --> 13:17.422
right out here on the street.

13:20.007 --> 13:23.762
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I forget that this is--

13:23.802 --> 13:25.179
this is very upsetting.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.847
It is.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.725
What happened to her parents?

13:28.767 --> 13:32.895
Oh, they were destroyed,
absolutely destroyed.

13:34.355 --> 13:39.319
Then, one day,
they were gone too.

13:39.360 --> 13:43.698
They just moved away
in the middle of the night.

13:43.740 --> 13:47.201
The home was just not the same
without little Cindy.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.037
She loved that little
rose garden out back.

13:50.079 --> 13:53.082
But soon
they all withered away,

13:53.124 --> 13:56.043
gone just like her.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.463
You told me
this was a good neighborhood.

13:58.505 --> 14:02.550
It is, I mean,
after that day,

14:02.592 --> 14:05.553
the people in the neighborhood
started locking their doors,

14:05.595 --> 14:10.433
but time passes and they
moved on with their lives

14:10.475 --> 14:11.850
as if it never happened.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.105
So...

14:16.147 --> 14:17.524
Are you hungry?

14:17.565 --> 14:19.609
You know, I just made
some deviled eggs.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.027
No, thanks.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.487
I need to go.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.156
-Excuse me.
-Well, another time then?

14:25.198 --> 14:28.451
I think you'll like
trying my pasta salad.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.996
Hey, is Ross in there?

14:32.038 --> 14:33.206
Mm-hm.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.458
Hey! Yes, yes,

14:35.500 --> 14:38.919
I'll get those escrow documents
to you later today.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.673
Maggie, my favorite flipper,
how's the new home?

14:41.715 --> 14:43.883
You sold me a house
that a girl was abducted from.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.177
What?

14:46.219 --> 14:47.428
You didn't know about this?

14:47.470 --> 14:48.929
Uh...no.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.849
It happened over 40 years ago.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.726
Shouldn't it have been
in the disclosures?

14:52.767 --> 14:54.394
-You would think.
-Yeah.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.229
And that's not all, the mother
of the kidnapped girl

14:56.270 --> 14:58.523
moved back east
and killed her husband.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.483
She's doing time in
a Pennsylvania prison

15:00.525 --> 15:01.776
for second degree murder.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.570
Wow.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.071
Let me pull
the county assessor's report

15:05.112 --> 15:06.573
and try to figure out
what happened.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.575
Please understand I didn't know
a thing about this.

15:08.616 --> 15:12.245
I don't want to lose you
as a client.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.748
Okay, thanks.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.627
How's Ava adjusting?

15:19.669 --> 15:22.463
We're making friends
with the neighbors...

15:22.505 --> 15:23.506
and the ghosts.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.512
Take care.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.506
-Hey, Ross.
-I'm at your place.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.383
Oh, I won't be home
for another hour.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.093
Ah, no worries,
I'm just dropping off

16:09.135 --> 16:10.887
the county assessor's report
for the last two sales

16:10.929 --> 16:12.138
on your property.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.265
Neither of them list
the kidnapping incident,

16:14.307 --> 16:16.517
so, we'll have
to do a deep dive

16:16.559 --> 16:18.853
to see why they weren't
compelled to mention it.

16:18.895 --> 16:22.398
Could be because the incident
took place out on the street.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.734
I just thought I'd drop
it off so that you knew

16:24.776 --> 16:27.403
I wasn't trying
to pull one over on ya.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.822
Okay, thanks.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.406
I'll take a look
as soon as I get home.

16:30.448 --> 16:31.825
Okay, bye.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.015
Hey, Gino.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.684
It's been a while.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.186
Hope you're doing well.

17:00.227 --> 17:02.104
Ah, that's good to see.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.482
You alone?
Where's Maria?

17:04.523 --> 17:06.358
Is she still the one
taking care of you?

17:06.400 --> 17:09.194
Out shopping?

17:09.236 --> 17:10.488
Well, is something wrong?

17:13.115 --> 17:14.659
Something in here?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.829
No? Uh...

17:18.872 --> 17:20.289
-This?
-Uh-huh.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.040
Ah.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.125
Okay, uh, top drawer?

17:25.545 --> 17:26.713
No?

17:26.753 --> 17:27.755
Middle?

17:27.797 --> 17:30.466
-No.
-No?

17:30.508 --> 17:31.843
Bottom.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.594
Yeah, yeah.

17:41.435 --> 17:44.313
What are you doing
in this house?

17:44.355 --> 17:46.190
Gene let me in.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.984
Who are you?
Where's Maria?

17:50.987 --> 17:55.366
I'm his sister and
I'm taking care of him now.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.911
And more importantly,
who are you?

17:57.952 --> 17:59.245
I'm Ross Townes,
I'm sort of

17:59.286 --> 18:01.163
the unofficial neighborhood
real estate agent.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.082
Ah.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.044
Did you say
you were his sister?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.546
Yes, yes.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.965
Gene, you never
mentioned her before.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.431
Oh...I'm sorry,

18:18.472 --> 18:23.519
but your visit
is agitating my brother.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.399
You know, I've been working
on your brother for years

18:28.441 --> 18:29.984
to try and sell this place.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.861
But I'm sure you wouldn't
want to sell either

18:31.903 --> 18:33.905
since it's your family home.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.074
Did he tell you that?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.576
Our family is from Colorado.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.162
He bought this place himself
some 50 years ago.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.706
Oh, that's right.

18:43.748 --> 18:46.375
Maybe I should talk
to your other brother then.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.962
Oh, he wouldn't
be interested.

18:49.003 --> 18:51.255
Why not?

18:51.297 --> 18:53.340
-He's busy.
-Really?

18:53.382 --> 18:56.510
I thought he was dead.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.262
Died about four years ago.

18:58.304 --> 19:01.557
Gene told me.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.309
What are you doing?

19:03.350 --> 19:05.478
Calling the police,
you're not his sister.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.650
Please, please,
let me explain.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.569
Gene, will you stop please?

19:13.611 --> 19:15.237
-Let me explain.
-I have all

19:15.279 --> 19:16.155
the explanation that I need.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.782
You're a parasite

19:17.824 --> 19:19.033
taking advantage
of this poor man.

19:19.075 --> 19:22.411
Now I'm gonna put
an end to this.

19:22.453 --> 19:23.412
Are you okay?

19:23.454 --> 19:24.831
Did she hurt you in any way?

19:24.872 --> 19:26.124
Okay, everything's
gonna be okay.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.792
Just sit tight,
sit tight,

19:27.834 --> 19:29.627
they'll be here
any second, okay?

19:34.256 --> 19:35.424
She hasn't hurt you?

19:35.466 --> 19:37.551
Okay, okay, just sit tight.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.580
Hm.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.020
I had no choice.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.398
He was gonna
ruin everything

20:32.439 --> 20:34.608
and you know
it's your fault

20:34.650 --> 20:36.986
because you let him in.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.406
Oh!

20:40.447 --> 20:42.867
You're just like my husband.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.411
Out to make my life miserable.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.473
Henry didn't like the idea
of me coming back home.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.850
He tried to stop me too.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.810
I thought you were different.

21:09.852 --> 21:12.855
I thought you understood
how important this was.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.482
Well, no wonder
you were grumpy.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.777
You haven't eaten
your breakfast.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.695
Here, eat up.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.614
Don't you feel lucky
that Maria had

21:21.655 --> 21:23.866
that pesky
immigration problem.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.868
Come on, bite, bite, bite,

21:25.910 --> 21:28.704
so I could step in
and take care of you.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.123
What's the matter,
is it cold?

21:30.164 --> 21:32.833
Let me see, yes, too cold.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.460
I think
I'll heat it up for you.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.462
Can't eat your oatmeal
the way it is

21:36.503 --> 21:39.257
because you didn't eat it
when you were supposed to.

21:43.886 --> 21:46.222
When will she learn
that she just needs

21:46.264 --> 21:48.724
to give me back my home.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.063
Got your oatmeal.

21:54.105 --> 21:57.650
I need you to eat.
Eat this!

21:58.567 --> 22:00.987
Oh, is it too hot now?

22:01.028 --> 22:02.404
Whoa.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.448
Well, you know what,
that's too bad

22:04.490 --> 22:08.202
because I can't
have you grumpy.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.037
I need to be home.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.539
It's the only place
that Cindy knows.

22:12.581 --> 22:15.459
Otherwise what kind
of a mother would I be?

22:15.501 --> 22:17.837
Look at the mess
you've made.

22:31.851 --> 22:36.272
Hey, do you want a roof
over your head tonight?

22:36.314 --> 22:39.483
Come with me,
I know a place.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.726
Hello?

23:13.767 --> 23:15.269
Whoa.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.182
What are you
doing here, Zeke?

23:53.224 --> 23:54.474
-Hey.
-Our agreement is that

23:54.516 --> 23:56.018
you would always call first.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.270
Yeah, listen, I...

23:57.311 --> 23:59.063
I just found
some things in storage

23:59.105 --> 24:00.814
that you and Ava
might want.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.237
Dolphin.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.866
Ava's been wondering
what happened to this.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.034
-Thanks.
-Yeah, of course.

24:12.076 --> 24:14.452
Hey, listen.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.705
While I'm here,
do you mind if we talk?

24:18.456 --> 24:20.084
Ten minutes?

24:20.126 --> 24:22.878
Cup of coffee?

24:22.920 --> 24:24.838
Ten minutes.

24:24.880 --> 24:25.923
Okay.

24:28.301 --> 24:29.885
This place isn't half bad.

24:29.927 --> 24:31.137
Yeah.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.682
But is it safe?

24:35.724 --> 24:39.061
I don't need you
checking up on me.

24:39.103 --> 24:43.023
Look, Maggie, I'm a mess
without you and Ava.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.443
You should have thought about
that before stealing from us.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.488
I didn't steal it,
I invested it.

24:50.530 --> 24:51.949
It was gonna be repaid
with interest.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.700
-But you lost it.
-Look, I admit

24:53.742 --> 24:56.036
-it was a bad investment, okay?
-It was my money

24:56.078 --> 24:58.122
and money for our
daughter's college.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.290
Barely cleared the deposit

24:59.332 --> 25:00.624
-on this place.
-Hey, I knew

25:00.666 --> 25:02.001
-how much you need it.
-What, you think

25:02.042 --> 25:03.961
-that makes it okay?
-No, but you also

25:04.003 --> 25:06.504
never gave me a chance
to tell you why.

25:06.546 --> 25:09.591
That money was for us,
it was for this family.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.969
If that investment paid off
like it was supposed to,

25:12.011 --> 25:13.595
I could have left my job,

25:13.637 --> 25:15.473
no more traveling for
three weeks out of the month.

25:15.513 --> 25:16.974
I could have been here,
I could have been

25:17.016 --> 25:19.018
a better father to Ava
and a better husband to you.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.853
You can leave
your job at any time.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.356
Well, after ten years,
and do what, start over?

25:23.397 --> 25:24.857
What do you think
we're doing now?

25:30.363 --> 25:32.281
Right.

25:32.323 --> 25:35.993
Tell Ava that
I'll call her later

25:36.035 --> 25:37.328
and that I love her.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.400
Hey! I brought you
my deviled eggs.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.609
Sylvia, you are too much.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.153
Hey, I just made
a fresh pot of coffee.

26:11.195 --> 26:12.863
-You want some?
-Oh, I would love some,

26:12.905 --> 26:14.323
thank you.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.700
You really have done a lot.

26:16.742 --> 26:19.619
-Getting there.
-It's amazing.

26:19.661 --> 26:21.955
I love this house.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.457
Oh, look at that.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.000
What happened there?

26:25.042 --> 26:26.793
Are you just
doing work or?

26:26.835 --> 26:28.670
Oh, it was just a busted fan.

26:28.712 --> 26:31.631
I think the wires
need to be reattached.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.718
Oh, you should
be careful of that.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.095
Huh.

26:37.721 --> 26:41.599
So, any more
strange occurrences?

26:41.641 --> 26:44.311
Luckily, things seem
to have calmed down.

26:44.353 --> 26:46.272
Oh, well, you know,

26:46.313 --> 26:49.066
yesterday I saw
a strange car

26:49.108 --> 26:50.359
parked in front
of your house,

26:50.401 --> 26:54.280
an older model,
a silver sedan.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.907
You know, I don't mean
to be a snoop,

26:56.949 --> 27:00.286
but after our conversation
I thought I should tell you

27:00.327 --> 27:01.912
-when I see something--
-I appreciate that,

27:01.954 --> 27:04.039
but that car belongs
to my husband.

27:04.081 --> 27:06.083
Oh, well, I hope--

27:06.125 --> 27:07.793
I hope that went okay.

27:07.834 --> 27:13.132
I mean, I assume that those
conversations can be awkward.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.092
That is one way to put it.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.137
So is there any hope
for you two

27:18.178 --> 27:21.639
or think you might be
moving back in with him?

27:21.681 --> 27:22.808
Move in with him?

27:22.849 --> 27:24.768
No, he travels
so much for work

27:24.810 --> 27:27.146
that he lives in a hotel
when he's in town.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.606
If we ever did
get back together,

27:28.646 --> 27:30.399
and that is a major "if,"

27:30.441 --> 27:32.318
he'd move in here.

27:32.359 --> 27:35.112
Oh, well,

27:35.154 --> 27:37.781
that does sound like hope.

27:40.867 --> 27:43.287
-I gotta take this.
-May I use your bathroom?

27:43.329 --> 27:45.747
Yeah, right ahead.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.207
This is Maggie.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.752
Yeah, if I could pick up
those tile samples today

27:50.794 --> 27:52.212
that would be great.

28:10.648 --> 28:12.899
Well, I really appreciate it.

28:12.941 --> 28:13.900
Great.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.611
Thanks so much, bye-bye.

28:18.155 --> 28:19.198
Sylvia?

28:20.866 --> 28:22.951
Oh, sorry, I thought you
disappeared for a minute.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.495
No, I'm here.

28:24.537 --> 28:27.414
Do you happen to have
any cream or sugar?

28:27.456 --> 28:29.791
-I do.
-Oh, good.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.669
Coffee's great though.

28:35.673 --> 28:37.007
Ah.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.993
-Help!
-I'm coming!

29:05.035 --> 29:06.370
Help!

29:06.412 --> 29:08.205
Oh, oh, Maggie!

29:08.247 --> 29:10.040
Are you all right?

29:10.082 --> 29:11.417
What happened?

29:11.458 --> 29:13.126
-I fell.
-Oh, honey,

29:13.168 --> 29:14.253
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

29:24.471 --> 29:26.973
-I got 'em.
-Oh, you found my keys.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.059
Right on the counter
just where you said.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.769
You're going to be okay.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.896
-Just stay strong.
-Thanks. I'll call Ava's school

29:32.938 --> 29:34.648
and make sure you're clear
to pick her up.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.358
Okay, and we'll meet you
at the hospital.

29:36.400 --> 29:40.028
-You go get better.
-Thank you, Sylvia.

29:50.956 --> 29:53.417
I'd like to copy
these keys please.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.043
Sure.

30:04.637 --> 30:07.306
-Surprise.
-Where's my mom?

30:07.347 --> 30:11.435
Well, um, the first thing
you should know

30:11.477 --> 30:15.773
-is that she is okay.
-Something happened to her?

30:15.814 --> 30:18.233
You know, in her line of work,

30:18.275 --> 30:22.613
there are accidents
and she sort of fell

30:22.655 --> 30:26.325
and, um, the doctors
are making sure she's okay.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.577
And she asked me
to pick you up.

30:28.619 --> 30:30.954
Is that okay?

30:30.996 --> 30:32.331
Okay.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.333
Please do not worry.

30:34.374 --> 30:35.584
She's okay.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.211
Come on.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.549
I don't know
how I'm gonna handle

30:42.591 --> 30:43.883
sleeping while sitting up.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.302
Well, that is why

30:45.344 --> 30:47.513
they give you
the good drugs.

30:47.554 --> 30:50.349
How long is your arm
gonna be in that sling?

30:50.390 --> 30:52.685
A few days
and then a couple weeks

30:52.726 --> 30:54.687
before I can do any heavy work
around the house.

30:54.728 --> 30:56.355
Oh.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.731
Thank you for doing all this.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.149
Of course.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.526
Now do you want me
to call your husband?

31:00.567 --> 31:01.901
No.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.320
He's away and I want
to put off hearing,

31:03.362 --> 31:04.237
"I told you so."

31:05.447 --> 31:07.199
Maybe this house
really is cursed.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.284
Well, that might be
the drugs talking.

31:09.326 --> 31:12.245
I wish it were.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.498
You know, I thought
if I just kept my head down

31:14.540 --> 31:17.710
and ignored it,
it would all stop.

31:17.751 --> 31:19.586
And it had.

31:19.628 --> 31:22.881
God, I really screwed up now.

31:22.922 --> 31:25.217
Maybe I should just
sell and move on.

31:27.927 --> 31:30.263
Well...

31:30.305 --> 31:33.433
You have time to think
about that later.

31:33.475 --> 31:36.895
-Mm-hm.
-Now it's time for rest.

31:45.529 --> 31:47.030
Are you counting?

31:47.072 --> 31:50.492
Five on the one,
then move on to the rest.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.327
I'm counting, I'm...

31:54.747 --> 31:56.122
What's the matter, baby?

31:56.164 --> 31:57.290
You okay?

32:00.377 --> 32:02.504
Mommy's gonna make you
all better, okay?

32:07.300 --> 32:11.764
Okay, I want you
to take a warm bath

32:11.805 --> 32:14.474
and then I'm gonna
make you some soup

32:14.516 --> 32:17.394
and then we can
watch cartoons, okay?

32:17.436 --> 32:18.604
Okay.

32:20.731 --> 32:22.566
I'll go get that soup started.

32:27.571 --> 32:30.240
Thanks, Mom,
you're the best.

32:32.576 --> 32:34.160
Tuck me in!

32:42.502 --> 32:44.337
Okay, let's tuck you in.

32:47.006 --> 32:48.926
There you go.

32:50.677 --> 32:51.762
Goodnight, baby.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.308
Thanks, Mommy.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.184
I'm sorry?

32:58.226 --> 33:00.437
I said thanks, Sylvia.

33:06.902 --> 33:08.320
Goodnight, baby.

33:15.452 --> 33:17.245
Ava!

33:17.287 --> 33:18.413
Ava!

33:21.249 --> 33:24.085
Ava, are you here?

33:24.127 --> 33:25.086
Ava?

33:26.379 --> 33:28.006
-Oh!
-Have you--have you seen Ava?

33:28.047 --> 33:29.633
I just, uh,
dropped her off at school.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.134
Oh, my God.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.636
Sylvia, you can't just
take her like that.

33:32.678 --> 33:33.887
-You scared me.
-Oh, no, no, no.

33:33.929 --> 33:36.181
I left you a note.
Here it is, see?

33:36.222 --> 33:38.517
-I--I didn't see it.
-Oh.

33:38.558 --> 33:41.603
Well, we both just wanted you
to stay asleep.

33:41.645 --> 33:44.481
Thank you,
I really appreciate it.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.900
-Do you need my help today?
-I don't know.

33:46.942 --> 33:49.402
I just gotta figure out what
I'm gonna do with this place.

33:49.444 --> 33:50.487
And with my life.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.864
You know, the small things.

33:51.905 --> 33:53.448
Let me make you breakfast.

33:53.490 --> 33:54.533
Really, you've done enough.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.743
No, you have a busted wing.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.537
-I'm--I'm making you breakfast.
-But your husband?

33:58.578 --> 34:01.498
Oh, he will sleep the morning
away as always

34:01.540 --> 34:03.750
and I'll make it back in time
to make him lunch.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.129
Maggie.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.505
What the hell?

34:09.547 --> 34:12.342
I just had a little accident.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.385
A little accident?

34:13.426 --> 34:14.678
You went to the ER.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.388
I'm glad you're concerned.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.097
-How did you even...
-I stepped off the plane

34:18.139 --> 34:19.891
and I get a call from
the insurance company.

34:19.933 --> 34:21.266
It just happened yesterday.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.395
I was gonna call you today,
I promise.

34:23.436 --> 34:25.688
What have I told you about doing
too many things on your own?

34:27.858 --> 34:29.568
Is Ava okay?

34:29.609 --> 34:31.904
It was a one woman show.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.989
Okay.

34:34.031 --> 34:36.742
All right, so,
how are you getting along?

34:36.783 --> 34:39.118
We're fine, Sylvia
is here to help out.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.120
Sylvia.
Who's Sylvia?

34:41.161 --> 34:42.664
That's me.

34:42.706 --> 34:44.165
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

34:44.206 --> 34:45.918
Sylvia lives
just across the street.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.420
She's been an enormous help.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.422
I'm making breakfast,
do you want something?

34:50.463 --> 34:52.925
No, thank you, I'm good,
I've already eaten.

34:52.966 --> 34:54.927
Listen, I have another
red-eye tonight,

34:54.967 --> 34:57.888
but now with this,
I--I could cancel,

34:57.930 --> 34:59.222
take a couple days off work.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.307
You can't afford to do that.

35:01.349 --> 35:02.935
I can make it work.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.980
Ah, the eggs.

35:07.022 --> 35:08.189
Excuse me.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.445
So what's her deal?

35:13.486 --> 35:16.489
She spends her entire life
taking care of her husband.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.283
And so, what now,
she's taking care of you?

35:18.324 --> 35:21.327
I think she just likes
to get out of her house.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.830
I appreciate what
you're trying to do here.

35:23.872 --> 35:26.499
I'm still trying
to take care of this family.

35:28.251 --> 35:30.128
We're not yours
to take care of anymore.

35:36.468 --> 35:37.427
Okay.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.679
Uh...

35:39.721 --> 35:43.892
Well, can I still
pick up Ava from school

35:43.934 --> 35:45.435
and spend the afternoon
with her?

35:45.477 --> 35:47.938
Yeah, I'm sure she'd like that.

35:54.027 --> 35:55.946
Well, see, this is
your problem right here,

35:55.988 --> 35:57.530
it's labeled wrong.

35:57.572 --> 36:00.033
You turned off the dishwasher,

36:00.075 --> 36:02.869
not the ceiling fan
in the back room.

36:02.911 --> 36:04.287
Consider yourself lucky.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.748
I do.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.709
Hey, since I have you here,
can you finish this install?

36:09.751 --> 36:11.169
-Sure thing.
-Thanks.

36:36.695 --> 36:37.779
Cindy.

36:52.752 --> 36:54.295
Hi, baby.

36:54.337 --> 36:56.589
Oh, let me see.

36:56.631 --> 36:59.258
You look beautiful, wow.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.094
-Dad helped pick it out.
-Oh.

37:01.136 --> 37:03.096
He's always wanting
his little princess, huh?

37:03.138 --> 37:05.015
You can change
if you want to.

37:05.057 --> 37:08.810
I think I'll keep it on,
for him.

37:08.852 --> 37:09.853
Go play.

37:12.022 --> 37:15.192
-Thank you.
-I couldn't resist.

37:21.489 --> 37:24.159
Ah, Cindy.

37:30.123 --> 37:31.083
Ha.

37:32.167 --> 37:33.793
-Hey, Sylvia!
-Hey.

37:33.835 --> 37:34.836
Come push me.

37:34.878 --> 37:36.713
Don't you look pretty.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.007
I'm gonna fly
to the clouds today.

37:39.049 --> 37:41.634
I wanna fly to the clouds today.

37:41.676 --> 37:43.302
...clouds today.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.429
Okay.

37:45.638 --> 37:48.349
Way up into the clouds.

37:48.391 --> 37:49.809
Whew.

37:49.851 --> 37:51.352
-All set?
-Yep.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.353
Great.

37:52.395 --> 37:53.312
-This for me?
-Yeah.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.480
Thanks.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.108
One less thing
on my to-do list.

37:56.149 --> 37:57.358
Any time.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.985
And, uh,
next time I would, uh,

37:59.027 --> 38:00.946
leave this kind of work
to the professionals.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.198
-Have a good day.
-Oh, you--you too.

38:07.244 --> 38:08.870
Can you believe that guy?

38:08.912 --> 38:10.956
He never would have
said that if I was a man.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.415
I think he would
have said it to anyone

38:12.457 --> 38:13.792
who tried to do
electrical work

38:13.833 --> 38:15.085
and dislocated
their shoulder.

38:15.127 --> 38:16.002
Ha-ha.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.046
Higher!

38:18.088 --> 38:18.964
Wee!

38:25.137 --> 38:26.345
Woo!

38:26.387 --> 38:27.430
High enough, sweetie?

38:28.681 --> 38:31.309
-I've been thinking.
-Uh-oh.

38:31.350 --> 38:33.561
And I'm happy you have Sylvia,

38:33.603 --> 38:35.021
but she's not family.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.318
-No.
-Helen loves her so much.

38:41.778 --> 38:43.113
Push me, Mommy, push me!

38:45.323 --> 38:46.658
Hold on tight.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.201
-No.
-She would love to spend

38:48.243 --> 38:49.786
some time with
her granddaughter.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.997
-Zeke, no.
-Please?

38:54.207 --> 38:55.125
Wee!

38:55.167 --> 38:57.669
Way high!

38:57.710 --> 38:59.378
Up into the clouds.

39:08.888 --> 39:09.681
Ava!

39:22.527 --> 39:23.945
Ava!
Ava, oh, my God!

39:23.987 --> 39:25.780
What happened?

39:25.822 --> 39:27.866
-Baby!
-Sylvia, what happened?

39:27.907 --> 39:30.118
-What happened?
-Baby, are you okay?

39:30.160 --> 39:31.786
-Hey, baby?
-Are you all right, honey?

39:31.828 --> 39:32.745
Where is it?

39:32.787 --> 39:33.705
Is it your head?

39:33.746 --> 39:35.957
Get her inside.

39:35.999 --> 39:37.750
Is it your head, honey?

39:43.048 --> 39:46.425
-Maggie!
-I'm coming, I'm getting ice.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.261
Cindy?

39:48.303 --> 39:50.013
Cindy?

39:50.055 --> 39:52.724
-Okay, I'm here, I'm here.
-Watch her head, watch her head.

39:52.765 --> 39:54.351
Where are you?

39:54.392 --> 39:55.810
Where--

39:55.852 --> 39:58.730
I got you, you're okay.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.148
I'm sorry.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.484
-I'm sorry.
-It's--it's okay.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.777
-It was an old swing.
-She should have

40:04.819 --> 40:05.695
never been on it.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.739
If I--if I had thought

40:07.780 --> 40:10.158
that that was...

40:10.200 --> 40:12.744
I never wanna see her hurt.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.453
I know, really, it's okay.

40:14.495 --> 40:15.538
We've got it.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.456
Thanks, Sylvia.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.125
It's okay, I know, I know.

40:28.467 --> 40:29.635
Did you see that?

40:29.677 --> 40:32.138
-See what?
-She just stood there.

40:32.180 --> 40:33.639
Well, she's not a mom.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.267
She's probably
just not used to dealing

40:35.308 --> 40:37.102
-with something like that.
-And what would happen

40:37.143 --> 40:38.978
if you weren't here
and it was just her and Ava

40:39.020 --> 40:40.855
in a real emergency?

40:40.897 --> 40:42.148
Is she just gonna
stand there in shock?

40:42.190 --> 40:43.775
I...

40:43.816 --> 40:45.568
Well, I know someone
who wouldn't.

40:47.195 --> 40:48.780
-Zeke.
-I'm calling her.

41:02.210 --> 41:03.962
Oh...

41:04.003 --> 41:05.588
Who is this?

41:26.443 --> 41:28.069
-Helen.
-Maggie.

41:28.111 --> 41:31.614
You're looking good.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.616
Nice to see you too.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.827
-Come on in.
-Hold on a sec.

41:35.868 --> 41:37.996
Since we're in a bit
of an awkward situation

41:38.037 --> 41:41.082
with you and my granddaughter
no longer living with my son,

41:41.124 --> 41:44.085
perhaps we could discuss
some ground rules.

41:44.127 --> 41:46.296
Okay, sure.

41:46.338 --> 41:48.173
I'm here for Ava.

41:48.214 --> 41:49.466
From the looks of things

41:49.507 --> 41:50.883
and from what
my son has told me,

41:50.925 --> 41:52.635
it appears you need
an extra set of hands

41:52.677 --> 41:54.012
to help with her.

41:54.053 --> 41:57.390
So, if she needs to eat,
I'll feed her.

41:57.432 --> 42:00.435
If she needs to go to bed,
I'll tuck her in.

42:00.477 --> 42:03.562
However, if you need your
prescriptions picked up,

42:03.604 --> 42:05.731
-don't even--
-I'll take care of that.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.650
Good.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.319
Glad that was so easy.

42:09.361 --> 42:11.112
About what I expected.

42:11.154 --> 42:16.159
Now, could you show me
to my room please?

42:16.201 --> 42:19.578
I'd like to get settled before
Ava comes home from school.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.206
Oh, okay.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.669
-Hello?
-Hey, good morning.

42:26.711 --> 42:29.797
-Is this Maggie Richards?
-It is.

42:29.839 --> 42:32.758
This is Detective Gray
with the police department.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.386
We need to talk to you.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.571
Don't go anywhere.

43:00.870 --> 43:02.038
Yes?

43:02.080 --> 43:03.998
Oh, hi.

43:04.040 --> 43:06.418
Uh, is, uh,
Maggie here?

43:06.459 --> 43:08.336
No, she's not, she's out.

43:08.378 --> 43:09.670
Who are you?

43:09.712 --> 43:12.131
I'm Sylvia, the neighbor.

43:12.173 --> 43:14.259
I've been helping out.

43:14.300 --> 43:15.552
Oh, yes.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.388
And who are you?

43:18.430 --> 43:20.306
I'm Zeke's mother, Helen.

43:20.348 --> 43:23.393
Well, it is a pleasure
to meet you.

43:23.435 --> 43:25.562
And, you know,
if you need anything at all,

43:25.603 --> 43:27.063
please ask me.

43:27.105 --> 43:30.442
Ava can be quite
the little handful.

43:31.817 --> 43:33.027
That's true, but, you know,

43:33.069 --> 43:35.363
I'm pretty sure
I can handle her myself.

43:35.405 --> 43:37.865
I raised an active boy.

43:37.907 --> 43:39.909
You know, I'm sure
they're really grateful

43:39.951 --> 43:42.078
for all the help
you've given so far,

43:42.120 --> 43:43.704
but I'm here now.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.873
Thanks.

43:45.915 --> 43:47.166
I just want you to know s--

43:56.468 --> 43:58.094
-Do you know Ross Townes?
-I do,

43:58.136 --> 44:00.012
he's my real estate agent.

44:00.054 --> 44:02.515
When was the last time
you and him spoke?

44:02.557 --> 44:04.809
In his office
a few days ago

44:04.850 --> 44:07.770
and then we talked briefly
on the phone the next day.

44:07.812 --> 44:08.896
Why?

44:11.899 --> 44:14.026
He's dead, Mrs. Richards.

44:14.068 --> 44:16.488
What?

44:16.529 --> 44:18.697
I...I don't understand.

44:18.739 --> 44:21.451
We found his body
in the trunk of his car.

44:21.493 --> 44:23.244
A vagrant
was driving it.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.248
Ever seen him before?

44:27.290 --> 44:29.417
No.

44:29.459 --> 44:31.628
What did you
and Ross talk about

44:31.669 --> 44:33.296
the last time you spoke?

44:33.338 --> 44:35.089
He was dropping off
some paperwork.

44:35.131 --> 44:38.301
He called to tell me he was
gonna leave it on my porch.

44:38.343 --> 44:40.052
And this was what time?

44:40.094 --> 44:42.263
Late morning, maybe 10:30.

44:42.305 --> 44:43.722
I got home
about an hour later

44:43.764 --> 44:46.851
and the paperwork was there
and he was gone.

44:50.146 --> 44:52.482
Why would he kill him?

44:52.524 --> 44:54.400
We don't know yet.

44:54.442 --> 44:55.734
We're working on it.

45:16.839 --> 45:18.216
Cindy!

46:08.182 --> 46:13.479
Please, Cindy,
where are you?

46:13.521 --> 46:15.690
Why are you not here, Cindy?

46:19.776 --> 46:24.449
It's because of that woman
snoring in the guest room,

46:24.490 --> 46:25.491
isn't it?

46:27.326 --> 46:29.870
Yeah, yeah,
she frightened you away.

46:33.249 --> 46:35.418
Don't you worry, baby.

46:35.460 --> 46:39.380
Mommy's gonna get rid
of that old woman right now.

47:04.363 --> 47:05.281
Ooh.

47:07.866 --> 47:08.909
Oh.

48:39.834 --> 48:41.836
Hi!

48:41.878 --> 48:43.128
Hi.

48:43.170 --> 48:45.130
I am so sorry to bother you.

48:45.172 --> 48:46.465
Sylvia, what can I do for you?

48:46.507 --> 48:48.384
Well, you know,
I can't find

48:48.426 --> 48:50.553
my extra pair
of reading glasses

48:50.595 --> 48:52.680
and I--I'm pretty sure
I left them here the last time.

48:52.722 --> 48:54.557
You know, I haven't seen them,
but if I find them

48:54.599 --> 48:56.475
I'll bring them
to your house, okay?

48:56.517 --> 48:59.771
I would just love to come in
and look for them myself.

48:59.812 --> 49:01.689
No, actually I don't really
want you to do that.

49:01.731 --> 49:03.816
-Well, it'll only take a minute.
-No, like I said,

49:03.858 --> 49:05.610
if I find them
I'll bring them right over.

49:05.651 --> 49:09.071
-I think I left them upstairs.
-What are you doing?

49:09.113 --> 49:11.407
Who the hell
do you think you are?

49:11.449 --> 49:13.242
I did not give you permission
to come in!

49:13.284 --> 49:15.787
Get out of this house.

49:15.828 --> 49:17.121
Can you hear me?

49:17.162 --> 49:18.456
Hello?

49:20.625 --> 49:22.167
Okay, I'm calling the police,

49:22.209 --> 49:23.878
I'm gonna have you arrested
for trespassing.

49:31.427 --> 49:33.053
What's the matter?

49:33.095 --> 49:36.390
Oh, I slipped
on Ava's soccer ball.

49:36.432 --> 49:39.351
I think I broke my hip.

49:41.061 --> 49:43.105
Hold on, I'm coming.

49:43.147 --> 49:45.232
I don't freakin' believe this.

49:47.151 --> 49:48.736
Okay, I don't know what kind
of games you're playing here,

49:48.778 --> 49:49.986
lady, but I've had it
with you.

49:50.028 --> 49:51.029
Do you hear me?

50:03.835 --> 50:06.629
Help.

50:06.671 --> 50:08.213
Why are you doing this?

50:11.300 --> 50:13.218
Oh, dammit.

50:13.260 --> 50:14.595
Oh!

50:14.637 --> 50:16.973
Help, help!

50:17.013 --> 50:18.808
Somebody, please help me.

50:24.188 --> 50:26.440
Please, somebody,
she's trying to kill me!

50:26.482 --> 50:28.943
-Shut up!
-Help me!

50:28.985 --> 50:32.363
The lucky winners of this past
weekend super lottery drawing.

50:32.404 --> 50:33.739
Shut up!

50:59.724 --> 51:00.558
Helen?

51:03.352 --> 51:04.812
Oh, my God.

51:15.155 --> 51:16.072
Maggie.

51:17.992 --> 51:19.744
Maggie.

51:19.785 --> 51:21.537
-What happened?
-They're saying she tripped

51:21.579 --> 51:23.789
on the soccer ball,
she fell down the stairs.

51:23.831 --> 51:25.583
She broke her neck.

51:25.624 --> 51:27.251
-You weren't there?
-No, I was out.

51:27.292 --> 51:28.836
She was alone in the house.

51:28.878 --> 51:30.922
Ava was at school.

51:30.963 --> 51:33.131
-Where's Ava at now?
-I asked Sylvia to take her

51:33.173 --> 51:37.053
for some ice cream
to keep her away from this.

51:37.093 --> 51:39.095
-Does she know?
-No.

51:39.137 --> 51:42.767
I thought you and I could
tell her together later.

51:42.808 --> 51:44.894
We won't talk
about the soccer ball.

51:44.936 --> 51:46.896
God, no.
Of course not, of course not.

51:53.945 --> 51:55.529
Wait, wait, wait, I...

51:55.571 --> 51:57.531
Wait, wait.

51:57.573 --> 51:59.033
I'm her son.

52:18.928 --> 52:20.429
What is it?

52:21.680 --> 52:23.057
Nothing.

52:25.977 --> 52:31.398
Do you, uh,
ever see or hear anything

52:31.440 --> 52:35.694
or anyone in your house?

52:35.736 --> 52:37.153
I don't think so.

52:37.195 --> 52:39.949
Never heard the name Cindy?

52:39.991 --> 52:42.284
Um...

52:42.326 --> 52:45.329
I do think I had a dream
the other night

52:45.370 --> 52:47.372
where there was a Cindy.

52:47.414 --> 52:49.667
Or maybe it was Sandy.

52:49.708 --> 52:51.585
Was it a dream?

52:51.627 --> 52:53.504
Are you sure?

52:53.545 --> 52:57.925
Did you see a girl
in the house?

52:57.967 --> 53:00.176
That's silly.

53:00.218 --> 53:01.595
Don't say that.

53:01.637 --> 53:03.014
Why?

53:03.055 --> 53:07.018
Because it's--it's rude.

53:07.059 --> 53:09.561
You don't answer
a person's question

53:09.603 --> 53:11.981
by calling it silly.

53:12.023 --> 53:15.400
There are no dumb questions.

53:15.442 --> 53:17.028
I'm sorry.

53:19.947 --> 53:21.239
It's okay.

53:22.950 --> 53:24.409
Finish your shake.

53:34.210 --> 53:35.587
Hi, baby.

53:35.629 --> 53:36.922
I'll meet you inside
in a second, okay?

53:36.964 --> 53:38.049
Okay.

53:41.635 --> 53:44.304
-Sylvia...
-How is everything?

53:44.346 --> 53:47.223
-And how is Zeke?
-Ugh, about what you'd expect.

53:47.265 --> 53:49.727
Totally devastated,
but I'm more worried

53:49.768 --> 53:51.478
about how to break it
to Ava.

53:51.520 --> 53:54.899
I know, it's awful,
just awful.

53:54.940 --> 53:57.860
We'll obviously be gone for
a few days for her funeral.

53:59.486 --> 54:01.030
I just don't know
how we're gonna live

54:01.072 --> 54:02.698
in this house anymore.

54:02.740 --> 54:05.868
Listen, you just tell me

54:05.910 --> 54:10.081
if there's anything I can do
for your family, okay?

54:10.122 --> 54:11.373
-Thank you.
-I mean that.

54:11.415 --> 54:13.751
Thank you.

54:13.792 --> 54:15.627
-We'll talk soon, okay?
-Oh, I hope so.

54:15.669 --> 54:18.214
-Be safe.
-Okay, thank you.

54:41.403 --> 54:43.405
Here we are.

54:43.447 --> 54:45.074
This is going well.

54:45.116 --> 54:47.576
Yes, breathe in,
breathe, breathe.

54:47.618 --> 54:49.453
Woop.

54:49.494 --> 54:51.163
Ava.

54:51.205 --> 54:53.207
Wait for us, honey.

54:56.794 --> 54:57.962
Put your seatbelt on.

54:58.003 --> 54:59.130
Ah.

55:02.340 --> 55:04.051
I'll be right back.

55:04.093 --> 55:05.928
Don't move a muscle.

55:21.401 --> 55:22.444
Cindy?

55:24.071 --> 55:25.447
Cindy?

55:27.241 --> 55:28.075
Are you here?

55:28.117 --> 55:31.036
I'm home.

55:31.078 --> 55:34.330
And--and they're gone, Cindy.

55:34.372 --> 55:36.208
Cindy?

55:36.250 --> 55:38.502
Please come out.

55:38.543 --> 55:40.420
Mommy hasn't seen you
in so long.

55:40.462 --> 55:43.007
I--I want a big hug.

55:43.048 --> 55:45.634
Oh!

55:45.676 --> 55:48.846
Are you playing hide and seek?

55:48.887 --> 55:51.140
Okay.

55:51.182 --> 55:52.933
I'm coming to get you.

55:55.811 --> 55:58.730
Come out, come out

55:58.772 --> 56:02.151
wherever you...are.

56:04.069 --> 56:06.280
I got you.

56:11.202 --> 56:12.577
Cindy!

56:14.621 --> 56:16.498
Cindy.

56:16.540 --> 56:18.876
Why are you doing this to me?

56:23.130 --> 56:24.298
Oh.

56:27.051 --> 56:32.931
Because it's still
their home,

56:32.973 --> 56:34.474
isn't it?

56:34.516 --> 56:35.767
Yeah.

56:39.188 --> 56:41.481
Soon enough.

56:41.523 --> 56:44.943
Soon enough they'll be gone.

56:44.985 --> 56:46.653
I promise.

57:00.209 --> 57:02.044
-You got that one?
-Yeah.

57:04.922 --> 57:07.383
-Hey, neighbor.
-Hey.

57:07.423 --> 57:10.426
I thought I wasn't supposed
to see you till tomorrow.

57:10.468 --> 57:11.845
Weren't supposed to.

57:11.887 --> 57:13.347
-Can you grab that for me?
-Yeah.

57:13.389 --> 57:15.224
-Thanks.
-Is everything okay?

57:15.266 --> 57:17.893
-How was the service?
-Oh, the service was fine.

57:17.935 --> 57:19.895
-Hm.
-But as soon as we got back

57:19.937 --> 57:21.772
from the funeral,
Zeke starts ordering me

57:21.813 --> 57:23.690
to sell the house
all of a sudden,

57:23.732 --> 57:27.278
saying that Ava's not gonna
live another night in it.

57:27.319 --> 57:30.072
-Well, maybe he has a point.
-Maybe,

57:30.114 --> 57:33.033
but there's no way
I can sell now.

57:33.075 --> 57:34.701
What do you mean?

57:34.743 --> 57:36.370
I spoke to an agent
this morning

57:36.412 --> 57:38.538
and he said that because
of what happened to Helen,

57:38.580 --> 57:40.207
the house is "toxic,"

57:40.249 --> 57:42.167
so there's no way
I can sell it

57:42.209 --> 57:44.086
for anything close
to what I paid for it.

57:44.128 --> 57:46.380
I can't take
that kind of loss,

57:46.422 --> 57:49.300
so it looks like we're stuck
here for a while.

57:49.341 --> 57:52.010
Well, I'm really sorry
to hear that.

57:52.052 --> 57:55.431
I mean, I'm glad for me.

57:55.472 --> 57:57.975
I get to keep
my wonderful neighbor.

58:04.398 --> 58:05.774
Gotta think.

58:05.816 --> 58:07.692
Think, think, think,
think, think.

58:07.734 --> 58:08.902
Oh.

58:21.415 --> 58:22.249
Thank you.

58:24.918 --> 58:26.295
-Hi.
-Hi!

58:26.337 --> 58:29.631
Uh, I would like
a vanilla latte.

58:29.673 --> 58:33.051
And, um, is there anyone
who can help me

58:33.093 --> 58:34.719
get on the Wi-Fi?

59:05.959 --> 59:07.961
Sylvia, is that you?

59:09.671 --> 59:11.215
-Hello, beautiful!
-Who are you?

59:11.256 --> 59:13.509
It's me, Marv,
you know me.

59:13.550 --> 59:15.760
Get your hands off of me!

59:16.928 --> 59:18.013
You like it rough, huh?

59:18.055 --> 59:21.016
Let me go!

59:21.058 --> 59:22.476
Yeah, you said
you wanted a fight,

59:22.518 --> 59:25.103
I just didn't think
you'd pack quite the punch.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.232
Come and get it, baby.

59:29.483 --> 59:31.443
Come and get it, baby.

59:31.485 --> 59:33.487
Get your hands off of me!

59:39.201 --> 59:40.118
You okay?

59:40.160 --> 59:42.287
-Yeah.
-Yeah, call the police.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:12.276
So I need to ask if you want
to press charges.

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:15.487
Uh, yeah, why wouldn't I?

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.906
Well, he says
you invited him here.

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:20.284
-Excuse me?
-He says you two connected

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:22.286
on an adult website
that caters to people's

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:24.704
-more quirky sexual urges.
-Wha--what?

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:27.749
He says it's all part of a game
that you requested.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.543
Well, he's lying.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.601
He showed me the post.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:46.935
What post?

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:48.395
Didn't have your name.

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:50.897
Had the handle
"FlipMeUpFlipMeDown."

01:00:50.939 --> 01:00:52.316
You flip houses, right?

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:03.327
I swear I didn't join
any website for--

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:05.870
Along with your address,
there was a description

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:09.124
of the fantasy you wanted
and a secret password

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:11.084
that you were supposed
to say to each other.

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:13.878
-A password.
-"Come and get it."

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:30.979
Listen, I don't know
anything about a password.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:33.315
-Look, it's all on the website--
-I'm sorry, are you trying

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:35.025
to shame me into
not pressing charges?

01:01:35.066 --> 01:01:36.734
-No, ma'am, I'm just--
-Or maybe you're just

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:38.695
trying to avoid doing
your paperwork, I don't know,

01:01:38.736 --> 01:01:40.197
but regardless I am
not saying that I had

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:42.073
anything to do
with that guy.

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:45.910
Press charges.

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:56.421
So since you didn't go
on that website,

01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:59.132
someone else did
pretending they were you.

01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:01.552
Somebody must be trying
to set you up.

01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:03.387
Who do you know
that would do that?

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:06.181
Oh, I have to go
and check on Gene.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:09.476
I'll be right back.

01:02:09.518 --> 01:02:12.145
I can't think of anyone
who would do that.

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:13.689
Are you positive?

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:18.735
God, why do you
treat me like this?

01:02:18.776 --> 01:02:21.488
Haven't I done
everything I can for you?

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:24.658
And why are you trying to keep
me away from my daughter?

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.951
She is so close.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:27.952
What is wrong with you?

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:33.124
Oh, you've gotta
stop being grumpy.

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:35.419
You have got to stop this.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.504
But I'm gonna
have to make sure

01:02:37.546 --> 01:02:41.091
that you are fed properly.

01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:50.225
Huh.

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:56.773
Well, I guess I just can't
leave you sitting there.

01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:04.822
You just wait in here
and I'll be back

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:06.742
to take care of you later.

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:18.253
I can't even imagine
what would have happened

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.796
if you hadn't been here.

01:03:19.837 --> 01:03:22.799
Hm, well, women in arms.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.093
-Yeah.
-But with that crazy man

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:30.223
breaking in, I can't believe
you're staying tonight.

01:03:30.265 --> 01:03:33.184
I mean, after all the things
that have happened,

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:36.688
I would be moving out
and taking the first offer

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:38.523
-that comes my way.
-The thought has crossed

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:40.858
-my mind.
-Hm!

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.445
But I was thinking about
what that detective said.

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:46.239
Someone is doing this
on purpose.

01:03:46.281 --> 01:03:49.701
Someone is trying
to get me to leave.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.745
But I'm not gonna do that.

01:03:51.787 --> 01:03:53.997
I'm staying.

01:03:54.038 --> 01:03:56.625
I'm gonna find out
who it is.

01:03:56.667 --> 01:03:59.002
Good, good for you.

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:04.007
We should get you to bed.

01:04:04.048 --> 01:04:06.217
It's been a rough night.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:07.594
I'll clean up.

01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:11.306
I insist on staying the night.

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:15.310
I want to keep my eye
on the two of you.

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:16.770
So sweet.

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:34.912
Cindy.

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:38.916
I hear you.

01:05:01.857 --> 01:05:04.776
Cindy, where are you?

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:11.449
Please, not another game
of hide and seek, honey.

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:15.620
I've been waiting so long
to see you.

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:18.331
Come out, honey.

01:05:18.373 --> 01:05:21.251
I can't.

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:22.335
Why not?

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:24.254
This isn't my home.

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:25.839
This isn't my furniture.

01:05:25.881 --> 01:05:27.048
Where's my swing?

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.925
Where are the roses?

01:05:28.966 --> 01:05:32.804
Oh, honey, this--
this is your home.

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:37.893
And do you remember
the picture you made?

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:41.479
Look, baby,
it's still here.

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:42.439
See that?

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.233
And we can fix the swing

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:47.903
and re-plant the roses.

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:53.658
C-Cindy?

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.250
Cindy, where are you?

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.461
Cindy?

01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:06.755
Right behind you.

01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:08.047
Oh!

01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:09.883
Cindy!

01:06:09.925 --> 01:06:11.217
You're here.

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:12.719
Oh, you're really here.

01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:15.346
You--oh.

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:16.890
-Mommy?
-What?

01:06:16.932 --> 01:06:18.349
Can you read me a story?

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:20.560
Of course I can.

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:22.395
Here, you hop into bed.

01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:26.399
We are going to have

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:29.861
our whole lives
to spend together.

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:32.029
I'm so happy you're here.

01:06:36.033 --> 01:06:39.120
Everything's gonna be
just the way it was.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:42.582
You want me to read
or do you want to start?

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:45.042
-Can you?
-Okay.

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:46.670
Oh, this is a good one.

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:51.257
Sylvia?

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.886
Sylvia, are you still here?

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:14.823
Oh.

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:22.330
Cindy?

01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:29.379
-Oh.
-Whoa.

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:30.588
-Whoa, sorry.
-Where is she?

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:34.009
-Where--where is Cindy?
-Who?

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.427
The--there.

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:37.929
Are you okay?

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:39.597
You were sleeping
so soundly in there

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:41.725
I thought I was gonna have
to throw some water on you

01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:43.018
to wake you up.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:47.522
Well, I've got
a real busy day,

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:50.191
I've gotta get this
little one to school.

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:53.570
I--I need my morning coffee.

01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:55.822
Get this noodle started.

01:07:57.532 --> 01:07:58.742
Right.

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:06.165
-Mom, gotta get my stuff.
-Okay.

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:21.305
Cindy Thomas.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.728
Where is she?
Where's Cindy?

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.479
I've lived here for years.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.733
The home is just not the same
without little Cindy.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.109
She was such a beautiful girl.

01:08:34.151 --> 01:08:36.654
She loved that little
rose garden out back,

01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:39.657
but soon they
all withered away.

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:46.957
-Mom, let's go.
-Yeah, coming.

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:52.962
This is going to help.

01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:57.884
This is going
to make you feel at home,

01:08:57.926 --> 01:08:59.385
my baby.

01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:09.895
These.

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:30.166
Metro Police,
how may I direct your call?

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:32.460
Hi, I'm trying to reach
a detective who used to work

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:34.796
in the mid-city district,
Jack Arnold.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.006
Commissioner Arnold?

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:37.715
He oversees
the Western Bureau now.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:40.135
-Can I transfer you?
-Yes, thanks.

01:09:42.219 --> 01:09:43.220
Ah.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:00.571
Okay.

01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:03.741
Wow, how time flies.

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:06.285
Oh, ooh.

01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:07.537
Beautiful.

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:13.877
Hey.

01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:15.503
Can you pick up
Ava from school?

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:17.755
Yeah, of course,
it'd be my pleasure.

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:19.507
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:20.508
Thanks.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:22.927
Hey, is everything all right?

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:24.971
It's...

01:10:25.013 --> 01:10:26.973
Maggie Richards?

01:10:27.015 --> 01:10:28.349
Sorry, I gotta go.

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:31.519
-This way.
-Thanks.

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:35.272
-Hi.
-Hi, can I help you?

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:38.484
I've come to pull
Ava Richards from class.

01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:40.028
Uh, my name is Sylvia Holmes

01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:43.280
and I'm sure I'm on
the approved list.

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:45.116
Did my mom
have another accident?

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:47.202
Is that why you're getting me
out of school early?

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:51.164
No, no, she asked me
to pick you up early

01:10:51.206 --> 01:10:56.335
because she thought you
deserved a fun day today.

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:57.712
-Really?
-Mm-hm.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:10:58.629
Cool.

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:03.467
-What are those for?
-Well, I thought

01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:05.803
you'd like to have
a little photo shoot

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:09.473
in a beautiful garden
this afternoon.

01:11:13.144 --> 01:11:15.312
Maggie Richards,
Deputy Commissioner Arnold.

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:17.314
I appreciate you
taking the time to see me

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:18.942
on such short notice.

01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:22.278
Well, you had
the correct password:

01:11:22.319 --> 01:11:24.447
Cindy Thomas.

01:11:24.488 --> 01:11:27.742
One of my first cases
after I got my gold shield.

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:31.871
Still haunts me though that
we never found that little girl.

01:11:31.913 --> 01:11:36.960
So, are you one of these amateur
cold case investigators?

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:39.378
No, my daughter and I live
in the Thomas's old house

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.256
and my neighbor Sylvia Holmes
was around

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:42.757
when the little girl
went missing.

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:46.427
But, frankly, something
is just off about her.

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:49.180
I mean, she seems to know
things about this case.

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:53.726
I--I'm just curious,
was Sylvia ever a suspect?

01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:56.104
I don't remember
a Sylvia Holmes.

01:11:57.605 --> 01:11:58.773
I remember
a Gene Holmes

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:00.441
that lived
across the street.

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:02.735
That's her husband,
he still lives there.

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:04.320
Well, that's interesting.

01:12:04.361 --> 01:12:07.323
The Gene Holmes I know,

01:12:07.364 --> 01:12:10.118
he wasn't married
at the time.

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.245
-Did he have a girlfriend?
-No, no, no.

01:12:12.287 --> 01:12:14.289
He was a loner.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:15.999
Trust me,
we talked to him a lot,

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.752
had an airtight alibi
as far as the kidnapping went.

01:12:19.794 --> 01:12:21.462
What about Cindy's parents?

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:25.049
Do you think they might have
had any connection with Sylvia?

01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:29.345
Henry and Veronica Thomas were
always suspects in my mind.

01:12:29.386 --> 01:12:31.139
But we could
never prove anything.

01:12:31.181 --> 01:12:33.183
About a year later,
I re-opened the case

01:12:33.224 --> 01:12:34.976
after Veronica killed him.

01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:36.686
She claimed it was
in self-defense,

01:12:36.727 --> 01:12:38.146
but nobody believed her.

01:12:38.188 --> 01:12:40.148
I still wasn't able
to make the connection

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:42.483
between her and the missing
child though.

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:44.652
And as for Sylvia Holmes,

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:47.446
nah, that's a--
that's a new name to me.

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:49.573
Maybe if I could
just talk to Veronica,

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:51.659
you know,
if she's still in prison.

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:56.080
-Hm, I wonder.
-What?

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:57.707
Let me make
a couple of calls

01:12:57.748 --> 01:12:59.667
and then I'll get back to you
later today.

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:00.793
Yeah, okay.

01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:02.879
-Thank you, Commissioner.
-Sure.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:09.927
Now, you go clean up
for the photos.

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:13.681
I've laid out a beautiful dress
for you to wear.

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:25.151
I think Sylvia knows what
happened to the missing girl.

01:13:25.193 --> 01:13:26.527
Wait, what?

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:27.528
That's crazy.

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:28.821
What makes you think that?

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:29.822
It's a long story.

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:31.741
Just trust me on this, okay?

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:34.035
All right, I'm pulling up
to the school now.

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:35.536
We'll be over there shortly.

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:37.080
No, no,
don't come to the house.

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.164
I'm gonna grab
a change of clothes

01:13:38.206 --> 01:13:39.623
and anything else
I can think of

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:41.167
and we'll come stay
with you at the hotel

01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:43.253
-if that's okay.
-Yeah, of course.

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:46.089
-I want us to be together.
-Me too.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.478
Sweet dear,

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.149
don't you just
look precious?

01:14:06.817 --> 01:14:10.696
So, how do you like
your room?

01:14:10.738 --> 01:14:12.489
Everything's moved around.

01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:13.783
Yeah!

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:16.660
Yeah, it's just the way
it used to be.

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:19.372
Except for this
awful paint color.

01:14:19.414 --> 01:14:22.083
But we can fix that later.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:26.421
Oh, wait.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.715
I wanna see if you remember.

01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:32.260
Do you remember
their names?

01:14:32.302 --> 01:14:33.344
Dolly?

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:35.554
Yes, that's Dolly.

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:38.391
And...

01:14:38.433 --> 01:14:39.392
Hannah?

01:14:39.434 --> 01:14:41.018
Yes.

01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:46.274
I wanna go outside.

01:14:46.316 --> 01:14:48.985
-Uh...
-I don't wanna play with dolls.

01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:53.614
-I wanna play soccer.
-Cindy, you don't like soccer.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:57.285
Cindy? Who's Cindy?

01:14:57.327 --> 01:14:59.036
Yeah.

01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:02.248
Well, maybe you are
a little too old for dolls.

01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:03.916
So, are you hungry?

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:07.837
Because I've made us
a wonderful picnic.

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:09.839
-I made pie.
-Really?

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.341
-Uh-huh.
-What kind?

01:15:11.382 --> 01:15:14.093
-Cherry.
-I love cherry.

01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:16.095
I know.

01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:17.472
I like apple.

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:24.854
Oh, no, Cindy,
you like cherry pie.

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:37.116
-Maggie.
-Commissioner Arnold.

01:15:37.158 --> 01:15:38.701
Got some news for you.

01:15:38.742 --> 01:15:42.330
Veronica Thomas was paroled
over a year ago.

01:15:42.372 --> 01:15:44.374
-Excuse me?
-Early release,

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:45.500
good behavior.

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:48.627
-Where is she now?
-Parole officer said

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:50.338
that she, uh,
she did her time

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.423
at a halfway house back east,

01:15:52.465 --> 01:15:54.425
then left and hasn't
been heard from

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:57.303
since about the beginning
of the year.

01:15:57.345 --> 01:15:59.305
Do you have
a current picture of her?

01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:00.556
Way ahead of you.

01:16:00.597 --> 01:16:01.974
I'll text it to you.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:08.731
Here's my cherry pie that
you've always loved so much.

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:15.530
This is good for cherry pie.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:18.324
Oh, how it warms my heart

01:16:18.366 --> 01:16:20.576
to hear you say that.

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:25.873
Oh, my God.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:29.126
That's her, that's Sylvia.

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:32.046
I can assure you
that's Veronica Thomas.

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:34.048
Her name's
definitely not Sylvia.

01:16:35.383 --> 01:16:38.553
-Maggie, hello?
-Ava?

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:41.138
-What's going on, Maggie?
-She's got my daughter.

01:16:47.728 --> 01:16:49.188
I need all available units.

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:51.232
Possible hostage situation.

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:55.903
What are you doing?
What is this?

01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:58.406
We're celebrating.

01:16:58.448 --> 01:16:59.823
She came back.

01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:04.245
After all this time,
she came back.

01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:06.080
Your name's not Sylvia, is it?

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:08.040
It's Veronica.

01:17:08.082 --> 01:17:09.625
Oh.

01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:13.379
I haven't heard that name
in quite a while.

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:17.174
But because
you're here, Cindy,

01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:21.678
I think it's only fitting
that I go by my God-given name.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.931
That's not Cindy.

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:25.516
Of course it is.

01:17:25.558 --> 01:17:27.059
Look at her.

01:17:27.101 --> 01:17:29.186
It's my Cindy.

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:32.482
Cindy? Who's Cindy? I'm Ava.

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:34.942
Oh, why would you say that?

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:37.027
Come on, you're Cindy.

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:39.113
I'm not!

01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:41.282
It's okay, it's okay.

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:43.618
Veronica, you don't
have to do this.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.244
Do what?

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:49.540
I--I am trying to have
a nice peaceful picnic

01:17:49.582 --> 01:17:50.833
with my daughter.

01:17:50.874 --> 01:17:54.295
And--and look,
now you have upset her

01:17:54.337 --> 01:17:56.380
and you've upset me too.

01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:58.257
Please, I just want her safe.

01:17:58.299 --> 01:18:01.511
Oh, you mean
she's not safe with me?

01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:02.845
I am her mother.

01:18:02.886 --> 01:18:05.139
It is my job to keep her safe.

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:06.682
But you don't think
I can do that?

01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:08.684
You don't think
I know how to do that?

01:18:08.725 --> 01:18:10.686
-I didn't say--
-I know how to take care

01:18:10.727 --> 01:18:12.104
of my daughter.

01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:15.065
My little princess.

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:16.484
Ow! Ow!

01:18:16.526 --> 01:18:17.818
Ava, get in the house!

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.571
No, no!

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:23.949
-Oh, you've ruined everything.
-Veronica, stop.

01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:26.743
-You've taken her away from me.
-No, I didn't.

01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:28.996
You're the one who took
Cindy away, admit it.

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:31.415
-What?
-You--you made up the story

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:34.335
-about her being kidnapped.
-That's--that's not true.

01:18:34.377 --> 01:18:35.919
What did you do?
You did something to her.

01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:37.380
-No!
-Did you kill her?

01:18:37.421 --> 01:18:40.257
No, I tried to save her.

01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:43.177
Oh, no, you--you've gotta get
off of there.

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:44.595
Don't go in there.

01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:45.596
You cannot be in there.

01:18:45.638 --> 01:18:46.805
Get out of my roses.

01:18:46.847 --> 01:18:48.265
Get off of them now.

01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:51.227
You can't be on there.

01:18:51.268 --> 01:18:53.312
Please, you don't understand.

01:18:53.354 --> 01:18:55.565
You can't be there.

01:18:55.606 --> 01:18:57.608
I've lived here for years.

01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:59.068
Where is she?

01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:00.486
Where's Cindy?

01:19:00.528 --> 01:19:03.113
Please get out of my roses!

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:05.824
She loved that little rose
garden out back,

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:08.994
but soon
they all withered away.

01:19:09.036 --> 01:19:12.081
Gone, just like her.

01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:13.583
Oh no.

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:16.627
Oh no, please.

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:18.128
Don't do that.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:22.341
Please, no, this--
this is our special place!

01:19:22.383 --> 01:19:23.967
Sylvia!

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.304
What are you doing?

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:29.348
-Oh no!
-No, no, no, no.

01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:30.683
No, no, no.

01:19:33.728 --> 01:19:35.896
No, Sylvia, stop!

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:38.107
Oh no!

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:40.067
Maggie,
what the hell is going on?

01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:43.446
Oh, no, please, Maggie, please.

01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:45.448
Don't hurt my baby.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:49.243
Your daughter is down there,
isn't she?

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:51.161
Oh!

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.830
I was a good mother.

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:56.667
I was only trying to help her.

01:19:56.709 --> 01:20:00.170
[Young Veronica]
I want you to take a warm bath.

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:05.134
I'll go get
that soup started.

01:20:09.179 --> 01:20:10.598
Oh.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.349
I never should have
let her have the pills

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:15.269
and the cough medicine.

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:18.105
Hopefully she'll be
feeling better by tomorrow.

01:20:20.357 --> 01:20:21.400
What happened, Veronica?

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:22.735
Tell us everything.

01:20:26.863 --> 01:20:28.157
Wha--ah...

01:20:28.198 --> 01:20:29.908
That's too much, honey.

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:34.037
No, Cindy!

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:36.749
The medicine made her sleepy.

01:20:36.791 --> 01:20:39.543
She slipped under the water.

01:20:39.585 --> 01:20:41.462
It was an accident.

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:43.380
But I couldn't
tell her daddy

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:45.048
because I know what
her daddy would have said.

01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:46.801
He would have said
it was my fault

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:49.011
and he would have said
I killed her.

01:20:52.682 --> 01:20:53.849
Oh, my God.

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:19.458
Oh no.

01:21:28.425 --> 01:21:30.093
Oh!

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:31.846
No.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:33.972
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:35.641
Oh, please.

01:21:35.683 --> 01:21:37.184
Oh, please don't.

01:21:39.645 --> 01:21:42.105
You did make up the story
about the kidnapping.

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:44.734
I didn't know what else to do.

01:21:44.775 --> 01:21:47.361
They would have
turned against me.

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:49.405
Henry and the whole family.

01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:52.366
He would have hurt me,
he would have hurt me.

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:54.284
Was he gonna find out?

01:21:54.326 --> 01:21:55.285
Was he going to hurt you?

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:56.829
Is that why you killed him?

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:02.084
The only person
who loved me was Cindy.

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:05.087
Oh, Cindy.

01:22:05.128 --> 01:22:08.298
Oh, Cindy.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.675
I just...

01:22:09.717 --> 01:22:11.927
Come here, come here.

01:22:11.968 --> 01:22:13.804
Just stay here.

01:22:13.846 --> 01:22:16.891
I always--
I always tried to do

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.975
the right thing for you.

01:22:21.812 --> 01:22:26.191
I just...I wanted
to be with you again

01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:29.361
so that I could make sure

01:22:29.403 --> 01:22:31.906
nothing happened to you
ever again.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:34.408
I am so sorry.

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:37.703
I am so sorry, baby.

01:22:43.793 --> 01:22:46.754
It's okay, Mommy.

01:22:46.796 --> 01:22:47.922
I forgive you.

01:22:51.007 --> 01:22:52.468
You do?

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:55.846
I love you.

01:22:57.013 --> 01:22:58.766
Oh...

01:22:58.808 --> 01:23:01.059
I love you too.

01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:02.853
I love you so much.

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:21.538
Ava, Ava.

01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:30.714
Take care of your
little girl, Maggie.

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:55.781
All right.

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:26.144
-Let's get out of here, yeah?
-Yeah.

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:53.839
She came home.

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:57.300
I always knew
she'd come home.

01:25:00.554 --> 01:25:02.890
Ah, don't worry, baby girl.

01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:06.810
Mommy's coming home too.

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:11.899
I promise.
