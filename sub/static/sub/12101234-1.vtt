WEBVTT

03:23.854 --> 03:27.024
Oh... oh, my boy!

03:27.058 --> 03:28.225
Jack!

03:28.259 --> 03:30.660
It's Chris!
Look at you!

03:30.694 --> 03:32.662
Bloody hell!

03:34.298 --> 03:38.269
Look at you,
you haven't changed a bit.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.037
Nor have you.

03:40.071 --> 03:41.973
All right, calm down, love.

03:42.006 --> 03:43.506
Where's your bags?
You got bags?

03:43.540 --> 03:44.708
Oh, I'm traveling light, Mum.

03:44.741 --> 03:46.143
- Cup of tea?
- Yes, please.

03:46.177 --> 03:48.545
- Still two sugars?
- Yes, please.

03:50.047 --> 03:53.250
- Chris.
- Hiya, Dad.

03:55.552 --> 03:57.788
Well, it hasn't changed.

03:57.822 --> 03:58.756
Nor have you.

03:58.789 --> 04:00.523
Look at you.

04:00.557 --> 04:03.626
Oh, my boy!

04:03.660 --> 04:06.764
- Missed you.
- Missed you too.

04:29.353 --> 04:32.323
So you quit your job
at the quarry, then?

04:32.356 --> 04:34.225
Yeah.

04:34.258 --> 04:37.228
How is that old bastard
McCrae?

04:37.261 --> 04:41.866
He's old,
and he's a bastard.

04:41.899 --> 04:44.734
It's just the same.

04:44.769 --> 04:47.171
He'll live forever,
that man.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.879
Keepin' busy?

04:54.912 --> 04:58.615
Yeah.

04:58.648 --> 05:00.583
Doin' what?

05:00.617 --> 05:04.355
Oh, well, this and that.

05:04.388 --> 05:09.860
No idea, really, the...
the days just pass.

05:12.897 --> 05:14.965
Why don't you go to the pub?

05:14.999 --> 05:17.734
Have a drink
with your old mates.

05:17.768 --> 05:19.870
Nah.

05:19.904 --> 05:21.906
Go on.

05:23.274 --> 05:25.342
No, come on, Dad,
no, no, no, no, no...

05:25.376 --> 05:27.211
I insist.

05:30.647 --> 05:33.384
I'll pay you back.

05:38.222 --> 05:39.990
All right,
pint of lager, please.

06:09.887 --> 06:12.890
- Hey.
- Jack.

06:12.923 --> 06:15.725
Just remember, Chris,
it's not forever.

06:15.759 --> 06:20.164
We're just helpin' you
get back on your feet, okay?

06:20.197 --> 06:22.266
- I'll be fine, Dad.
- Yeah.

06:22.299 --> 06:25.668
But just remember...

06:31.208 --> 06:32.276
Hello, mate.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.812
Chris. I start today.

06:34.845 --> 06:37.348
Yes, you do.

06:37.381 --> 06:40.851
- Jack Blythe's boy.
- Yeah.

06:40.885 --> 06:43.287
Bit of a comedown,
isn't it?

07:18.789 --> 07:19.924
Hat on here.

07:22.927 --> 07:24.061
Jack Blythe's boy.

07:49.019 --> 07:50.354
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.156
Where you going?

07:52.189 --> 07:56.460
This is filthy, mate.

07:56.493 --> 07:58.162
You need to clean this up.

08:00.831 --> 08:04.201
Billy likes his trucks
nice and shiny.

08:04.235 --> 08:08.105
So get a rag
and clean your fucking truck.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.209
Fuck off.

08:12.243 --> 08:13.310
I'll get you a rag.

08:20.517 --> 08:22.519
I usually start
with the wheels.

08:22.553 --> 08:27.258
Give 'em a wipe...

08:27.291 --> 08:29.860
and then, I don't know,
just knock yourself out.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.867
Go on, 'ave him.

08:36.900 --> 08:40.571
Go on, Harry,
go on, Harry.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.349
Come on, Harry.

08:52.383 --> 08:53.517
Come on.

08:53.550 --> 08:54.451
Come on, Harry.

09:05.229 --> 09:06.497
- Come on, Harry.
- Come on, Harry.

09:08.432 --> 09:11.268
You all right, mate?

09:11.302 --> 09:14.371
Aww, yes!

09:16.240 --> 09:17.908
Aggh!

09:22.079 --> 09:24.948
Clean your fucking truck.

09:28.285 --> 09:29.386
When you've stopped behaving

09:29.420 --> 09:31.455
like a pair
of demented schoolboys,

09:31.488 --> 09:34.224
I've got a job for you.

09:34.258 --> 09:35.993
Pick two of them.

09:38.595 --> 09:40.397
Him.

09:40.431 --> 09:42.266
And him.

09:43.901 --> 09:45.502
You too, Blythe.

10:03.420 --> 10:04.955
That shed is staying, right?

10:04.988 --> 10:06.457
Yeah, that's staying.

10:12.663 --> 10:13.997
Hello.

10:25.008 --> 10:27.378
Oh-ho-ho, mate.

10:27.411 --> 10:30.881
Don't.
Don't even think about that.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.328
Yeah, what do you think, Dad?

10:44.361 --> 10:46.630
- Yeah, it's coming on.
- Mm.

10:56.607 --> 10:59.309
- Would you get me a beer, love?
- Yeah.

11:02.479 --> 11:04.014
So they tell me
you were in business

11:04.047 --> 11:05.716
back in Canada.

11:05.749 --> 11:08.485
Yeah. Coleridge.

11:08.519 --> 11:10.020
Had a turnover
of about 10 million,

11:10.053 --> 11:12.423
- at one point.
- Hmph.

11:15.292 --> 11:17.528
And?

11:17.561 --> 11:19.263
My partner was a crook.

11:19.296 --> 11:21.298
He robbed me.

11:21.331 --> 11:24.368
Nobody's ever robbed me.

11:24.401 --> 11:25.669
- I have plans.
- Yeah.

11:25.702 --> 11:28.305
People like you
have always got plans.

11:29.774 --> 11:31.341
In fact, if you're interested...

11:31.375 --> 11:32.643
If you're thinking
of asking me for money,

11:32.676 --> 11:34.578
you can fuck off.

11:40.150 --> 11:42.453
- Thanks, pet.
- Mm-hm.

12:11.048 --> 12:14.051
I don't care
what you were in Canada.

12:14.084 --> 12:17.054
Here, you're just a laborer.

12:17.087 --> 12:19.289
So fix my daughter's patio,

12:19.323 --> 12:22.159
and keep your fucking
eyes off her.

12:37.274 --> 12:39.543
Harry, you and Al can get out
of here if you want mate, I'll...

12:39.576 --> 12:42.379
I'll clear of you.

12:43.614 --> 12:44.748
No.

12:54.191 --> 12:56.794
Hey, do you mind if I
put some music on?

12:56.828 --> 12:58.161
No, you crack on.

13:12.643 --> 13:14.111
I love this song.

13:14.144 --> 13:17.080
- Tune.
- Yeah.

13:17.114 --> 13:19.650
- You dance?
- No!

13:19.683 --> 13:20.617
- No?
- No.

13:20.651 --> 13:23.587
Why not?

13:23.620 --> 13:26.089
Ooh. You're wet.

13:26.123 --> 13:28.225
- What?
- Sweaty.

13:28.258 --> 13:29.359
It's hot.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.528
Tell me about it.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.532
Come on.

13:35.566 --> 13:37.769
- I'm no dancer.
- Come on.

13:37.802 --> 13:40.470
Show me what you got.

13:40.504 --> 13:43.875
Mm-hm.

13:43.908 --> 13:46.610
Come on!

13:50.714 --> 13:52.616
Come on.

13:52.649 --> 13:54.551
End of the day.

13:58.856 --> 14:02.492
Hey. All right,.

14:11.668 --> 14:13.236
Let's go.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.472
- It's all I got.
- Top moves.

14:15.505 --> 14:19.376
Hey!

14:23.747 --> 14:25.616
What the fuck
you think you're playing at?

14:25.649 --> 14:28.151
- Look, I'm sorry, I...
- Jesus.

14:28.185 --> 14:29.921
Sexual harassment, that is.

14:29.954 --> 14:31.321
If I told my dad
what you just did,

14:31.355 --> 14:32.656
you'd be a bloody dead man.

14:32.689 --> 14:33.758
Oh, come on,
I thought you were...

14:33.791 --> 14:35.325
Go on.

14:35.359 --> 14:37.795
Go on, piss off!

14:37.829 --> 14:39.463
I'm sorry.

14:45.335 --> 14:48.739
It's not funny.

14:48.773 --> 14:51.508
Well... it kind of is.

16:55.499 --> 16:56.801
All right.

16:56.834 --> 17:00.537
Time to go.

17:00.570 --> 17:03.340
What?

17:03.373 --> 17:04.909
Time to go.

17:04.942 --> 17:06.276
Go on.

17:20.657 --> 17:23.895
Should I call you?

17:23.928 --> 17:25.529
Mm...

17:28.099 --> 17:29.801
I'll speak to Billy.

17:29.834 --> 17:33.070
The patio still needs fixing.

17:54.892 --> 17:56.928
You should knock, Dad.

17:56.961 --> 17:59.030
It's my bloody house.

18:20.717 --> 18:21.919
Blecch.

18:36.033 --> 18:37.802
Come on, let's go!

18:37.835 --> 18:39.170
Come on.

18:39.203 --> 18:40.171
Come on!

18:40.204 --> 18:42.874
Back her up!

18:42.907 --> 18:44.041
That's it, keep coming.

18:44.075 --> 18:45.542
Come on, let's go!

18:45.575 --> 18:47.611
Keep coming, keep coming!

18:47.644 --> 18:49.479
Keep coming, all right...
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:49.512 --> 18:50.480
That'll do.

18:50.513 --> 18:51.681
Whoa!

18:51.715 --> 18:52.682
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

18:52.716 --> 18:55.820
No! No! Why'd you...

18:55.853 --> 18:57.154
Fuck's sake!

19:01.458 --> 19:03.094
Oh, for fuck's sake!

19:05.062 --> 19:06.730
Clumsy bastard, Mike.

19:06.764 --> 19:08.065
- What?
- Clear this up.

19:08.099 --> 19:09.566
No, fuck off,
this wasn't my fault!

19:09.599 --> 19:11.102
- Pronto!
- No! That's not my fault!

19:11.135 --> 19:14.772
- What happened, mate?
- You stay out of this, Tom.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.674
Stop crying like a lassie.

19:17.707 --> 19:20.011
Do not mess with me.

19:22.479 --> 19:24.581
- Fuck off.
- No.

19:24.614 --> 19:26.150
Don't you mess with me, Billy.

19:26.183 --> 19:29.452
I mean it.

19:31.588 --> 19:32.890
- You wouldn't.
- Yeah?

19:32.924 --> 19:35.059
You fuckin' try me.

19:38.029 --> 19:40.898
Yeah... okay.

19:40.932 --> 19:42.666
Uh, Tom.

19:42.699 --> 19:44.467
Tom, we need to sort this.

19:44.501 --> 19:46.469
- All right.
- I'm sorry, Mike.

19:46.503 --> 19:49.472
- All right. No worries, Bill.
- Yeah.

19:55.146 --> 19:56.881
Tom.

19:59.683 --> 20:00.851
Oi!

20:04.055 --> 20:07.524
Nobody talks to me like that,
you prick.

20:07.557 --> 20:09.827
Get this shit cleared up.

21:06.984 --> 21:10.587
Al, could I get the level,
please?

21:10.620 --> 21:12.823
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

21:50.227 --> 21:52.263
- See ya, then.
- See ya.

22:54.024 --> 22:57.694
What was it like
when you had money?

23:01.432 --> 23:03.367
I'm happier now,
to be honest.

23:03.400 --> 23:07.371
Liar.

23:07.404 --> 23:12.009
God, you must think this town
is such a bloody shithole.

23:12.042 --> 23:15.346
It's gotta feel so parochial,

23:15.379 --> 23:19.749
compared to what
you're used to.

23:19.783 --> 23:23.454
It's home.

23:23.487 --> 23:26.223
It's good to be home.

23:26.257 --> 23:31.061
I hate it.

23:37.268 --> 23:38.402
Ta.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.215
Thanks.

24:00.191 --> 24:02.927
Close the door, will ya?

24:02.960 --> 24:04.094
From the inside.

24:15.372 --> 24:18.275
I'm having some trouble
with my receipts.

24:18.309 --> 24:20.244
You think you could
sort them out?

24:29.019 --> 24:30.955
Yeah, sure.

24:30.988 --> 24:33.490
Your dad was good
at all that shite.

24:33.524 --> 24:35.492
He was a good man,
Jack Blythe.

24:35.526 --> 24:37.194
Still is.

24:37.228 --> 24:40.931
Yeah. Honest as the day is long,
but nobody's perfect.

24:43.200 --> 24:47.004
You'll get the same rate
as my quarrymen.

24:47.037 --> 24:51.242
- That okay?
- Yep. No problem.

24:54.945 --> 24:58.549
However, once the accounts
are finished,

24:58.582 --> 25:00.351
I'm gonna ask you for a bonus,

25:00.384 --> 25:02.953
and you'll be so grateful,
you'll give it to me.

25:04.588 --> 25:06.357
Ah, in your dreams.

25:06.390 --> 25:08.025
No, you will.

25:08.058 --> 25:09.460
Aye, right.

25:09.493 --> 25:11.262
No, you really will.

25:16.200 --> 25:19.470
You are a cheeky fuck.

26:08.485 --> 26:14.058
So, shall we go out later
and find a little pub?

26:14.091 --> 26:15.492
Don't be daft, Chris.

26:15.526 --> 26:16.960
Oh, come on, this is so stupid.

26:16.994 --> 26:18.028
I mean,
you're not a teenager,

26:18.062 --> 26:20.864
- you're a grown woman.
- Billy's obsessive.

26:20.898 --> 26:22.166
All right?
If he finds out about us,

26:22.199 --> 26:24.401
he'll sack you.

26:24.435 --> 26:26.070
Or worse.

26:26.103 --> 26:28.639
I can handle myself.

26:28.672 --> 26:30.441
You think you can.

26:33.610 --> 26:35.112
Look, trust me, Chris.

26:35.145 --> 26:38.015
- The last time I...
- What?

26:43.187 --> 26:46.523
Look, I was...
I was dating this guy.

26:46.557 --> 26:48.625
Rob, his name was, nice bloke.

26:48.659 --> 26:51.895
Solicitor,
office in town.

26:51.929 --> 26:54.098
We had plans.

26:54.131 --> 26:57.401
I was a singer then.

26:57.434 --> 26:59.403
Trying to be.

26:59.436 --> 27:01.338
And Rob was gonna back me,
you know?

27:01.372 --> 27:05.142
Pay for vocal lessons
and the rest of it.

27:05.175 --> 27:07.277
Billy found out.

27:07.311 --> 27:09.980
Says Rob was takin' a piss.

27:10.013 --> 27:11.982
So Rob tells him
to mind his own business,

27:12.015 --> 27:14.084
thank you very much.

27:14.118 --> 27:17.020
And bang!

27:17.054 --> 27:20.190
Billy put the poor bastard
in hospital.

27:20.224 --> 27:22.192
Well, that's not quite the same,

27:22.226 --> 27:25.929
'cause I'm not that guy,
boom.

27:25.963 --> 27:27.464
You just don't get it, do you?

27:27.498 --> 27:30.167
You work for Billy.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.269
You are his.

27:32.302 --> 27:34.538
That's how he sees it.

27:34.571 --> 27:38.675
His property.

27:38.709 --> 27:43.046
I mean, that's...
that's medieval.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.149
So you were a singer.

27:45.182 --> 27:46.550
Just a pub singer.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.318
- Wasn't very good.
- I bet you were great.

27:48.352 --> 27:49.586
No.

27:49.620 --> 27:51.388
Just did covers.

27:51.422 --> 27:54.258
You know, I nearly had
a record contract.

27:54.291 --> 27:57.161
God, it was like...

27:57.194 --> 28:01.265
nearly 10 years ago now,
I was living in London?

28:01.298 --> 28:03.700
Coulda done it.

28:03.734 --> 28:07.704
But Billy made me give it up,

28:07.738 --> 28:10.574
made me come back here.

28:10.607 --> 28:12.042
- Really?
- What do you mean?

28:12.075 --> 28:14.344
Don't believe me?

28:14.378 --> 28:16.079
No, it's not that,
it's, you know,

28:16.113 --> 28:19.016
we all make our own choices
in life.

28:19.049 --> 28:20.417
You can't just say
that your dad made you do

28:20.451 --> 28:22.186
something you didn't wanna do.

28:22.219 --> 28:23.187
I mean,
if you didn't wanna do it,

28:23.220 --> 28:24.354
you coulda said no,

28:24.388 --> 28:27.424
just told him to fuck off.

28:29.193 --> 28:31.228
Fair point.

28:31.261 --> 28:33.597
Except the thing is,

28:33.630 --> 28:37.067
you don't know Billy.

28:37.100 --> 28:38.569
Billy...

28:39.636 --> 28:41.572
...is someone...

28:41.605 --> 28:43.707
you don't say

28:43.740 --> 28:45.642
no to.

So if we use digger six
and digger nine,

29:35.592 --> 29:37.561
we can clear the whole area,
Billy.

29:37.594 --> 29:39.129
Yeah, make it quick.

29:39.162 --> 29:40.664
Billy, quick word.

29:40.697 --> 29:42.266
I finished your accounts.

29:42.299 --> 29:45.702
Good. Get back
and do a proper job.

29:45.736 --> 29:50.474
So, I've been thinking about
your tinworks in Milford.

29:50.507 --> 29:52.309
How'd you know
about the tinworks?

29:52.342 --> 29:53.544
From the bank statements.

29:53.577 --> 29:55.312
You get revenues
from the yard.

29:55.345 --> 29:56.781
I checked
with company's house

29:56.814 --> 29:58.215
and brought up
a list of directors.

29:58.248 --> 29:59.550
You're spying on me.

29:59.583 --> 30:01.251
No, just doing my job.

30:01.285 --> 30:02.719
Hmph.

30:02.754 --> 30:04.688
So tell me about the tinworks.

30:04.721 --> 30:06.423
Well, the turnover's good,

30:06.456 --> 30:08.158
but I reckon you're spending
way too much money

30:08.191 --> 30:09.259
on road haulage.

30:09.293 --> 30:10.594
You should buy a boat.

30:10.627 --> 30:12.329
Take the cargos
to the continents that way.

30:12.362 --> 30:14.164
From what I'm told,
that's the smart move.

30:14.197 --> 30:16.567
I drafted up some figures.

30:27.644 --> 30:30.747
No wonder you went bankrupt,
son.

30:49.399 --> 30:50.534
Blecch.

30:54.806 --> 30:57.809
Don't piss on the floor.

31:56.333 --> 31:58.803
Hey.

31:58.836 --> 32:02.940
Are you fucking my daughter,
Blythe?

32:02.974 --> 32:04.574
Are you?

32:10.414 --> 32:12.950
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

32:12.984 --> 32:16.788
Hmph.

32:22.459 --> 32:24.461
Fair enough.

32:24.494 --> 32:27.664
She's a grown woman,
she can make her own choices.

32:27.698 --> 32:29.834
But just you treat her nice,
huh?

32:29.867 --> 32:32.636
Otherwise, I might have
to pay a man to kill you.

33:01.498 --> 33:04.634
Let's book a room, huh?
A suite.

33:04.668 --> 33:07.872
We could fuck till dawn.

33:07.905 --> 33:09.573
- Would you like that?
- Sounds great.

33:09.606 --> 33:12.342
- Mm-hm.
- Or we could just go home,

33:12.375 --> 33:14.879
save a bit of money,
and just do it then.

33:14.912 --> 33:16.379
No, you know what?
Let's go mad,

33:16.413 --> 33:18.448
let's book a room,
and let's fuck till dawn.

33:18.482 --> 33:20.885
Or, we could buy a boat.

33:20.918 --> 33:22.385
- What?
- Yeah.

33:22.419 --> 33:23.821
Something like that.

33:23.855 --> 33:25.957
Sail away across the Atlantic.

33:25.990 --> 33:27.424
Cruise around the Caribbean,

33:27.457 --> 33:29.593
you could take me
to all your favorite places,

33:29.626 --> 33:31.394
drink rum all day.

33:31.428 --> 33:33.630
Oh, gosh, I'd be beautiful
and bronzed.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.432
Yeah.

33:35.465 --> 33:36.566
What do you say?

33:36.600 --> 33:37.601
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

33:37.634 --> 33:40.037
Yeah, yeah, sounds great.

33:40.071 --> 33:42.039
Maybe.

33:43.875 --> 33:45.977
One day.

33:51.115 --> 33:52.950
Hey.

33:52.984 --> 33:55.619
Hey, what...
what's the matter?

33:55.652 --> 33:57.088
Oh, nothing.

33:57.121 --> 34:01.591
Well, something's
obviously wrong.

34:01.625 --> 34:05.595
No, no, I just...
just needed a moment.

34:05.629 --> 34:08.331
Don't you get like that
sometimes?

34:12.837 --> 34:13.971
Dorien!

34:16.974 --> 34:19.676
It's so lovely to see you!

34:19.709 --> 34:23.380
This must be...

34:23.413 --> 34:24.748
Well, introduce us, then.

34:24.782 --> 34:25.950
Yeah!

34:25.983 --> 34:28.853
This is Elen.

34:28.886 --> 34:31.688
- Ah!
- And you must be Claire.

34:31.721 --> 34:33.423
- Sharon!
- Oh.

34:33.456 --> 34:34.624
Hi. I'm Chris.

34:34.658 --> 34:37.460
Sorry. Chris, Dor;
Dor, Chris.

34:37.494 --> 34:40.597
Um, we'll we've, um,
we've gotta go, so...

34:40.630 --> 34:41.966
Nice to meet you, Chris.

34:41.999 --> 34:43.333
Bye.

34:49.941 --> 34:51.541
Ex-boyfriend?

34:51.575 --> 34:53.677
Ex-husband.

34:53.710 --> 34:54.678
Ah.

34:54.711 --> 34:57.882
Yeah, he wasn't very nice to me,
to be honest.

34:57.915 --> 35:02.787
Even so, I still have
a soft spot for Dorien.

35:02.820 --> 35:04.055
Do you?

35:04.088 --> 35:05.622
That Sharon's a bit...

35:05.655 --> 35:07.524
isn't she?

35:07.557 --> 35:09.659
Elen!

35:24.809 --> 35:27.711
Do you ever miss Canada?

35:30.181 --> 35:33.617
Not really.

35:33.650 --> 35:35.953
Miss the money.

35:35.987 --> 35:39.656
Yeah, but...
you still have some, though.

35:39.689 --> 35:42.459
Right? You know, like,
stashed away?

35:42.492 --> 35:44.762
No.

35:44.795 --> 35:47.798
Had to mortgage the house
to try and save the business.

35:47.832 --> 35:50.968
And the legal fees.

35:51.002 --> 35:53.938
Jim, my partner, embezzled
nearly $2 million, see?

35:53.971 --> 35:55.840
Mm-hm.

36:05.615 --> 36:08.085
I'm not worried, though.

36:08.119 --> 36:10.922
I mean, once you've made
one fortune,

36:10.955 --> 36:15.026
it's easy enough
to do it again.

36:26.971 --> 36:29.206
Bad boy.

36:58.169 --> 36:59.569
All right, son?

36:59.602 --> 37:00.704
Couldn't sleep, Dad?

37:00.737 --> 37:04.175
Oh... no.

37:17.822 --> 37:22.760
How you getting on with, uh,
Billy?

37:22.793 --> 37:26.297
Fine. No worries.

37:26.330 --> 37:28.866
It's a good place to be,
actually.

37:28.899 --> 37:29.699
Billy's gettin' on,

37:29.733 --> 37:32.169
so he's gonna need
a bit of help.

37:32.203 --> 37:36.307
I can see a future
for me there.

37:36.340 --> 37:38.541
Just be careful, son.

37:38.575 --> 37:39.977
I can take care
of Billy McCrae, Dad.

37:40.011 --> 37:41.544
Don't you worry.

37:41.578 --> 37:42.980
Look.

37:43.014 --> 37:45.916
I worked for him
for 30 years, Chris.

37:45.950 --> 37:47.751
I did his books.

37:47.785 --> 37:49.652
I did his deals.

37:49.686 --> 37:50.421
I was there when...

37:50.454 --> 37:54.291
- Look...
- I know Billy McCrae.

37:57.762 --> 37:58.896
Okay.

38:20.217 --> 38:21.551
What are you lookin' at?

38:31.395 --> 38:36.033
My accounts,
the real accounts.

38:36.067 --> 38:38.735
I need your help.

38:38.769 --> 38:39.970
With what?

38:40.004 --> 38:42.373
I bought a new quarry
north of Newport.

38:42.406 --> 38:44.241
I want it to appear
as a capital asset.

38:44.275 --> 38:46.077
I paid cash,

38:46.110 --> 38:49.280
but it must not appear as income
anywhere.

38:49.313 --> 38:53.050
Keep it out of the hands
of the stinkin' taxman.

38:53.084 --> 38:54.819
Technically, that's fraud.

38:54.852 --> 38:55.986
If we're caught.

39:17.341 --> 39:20.778
Jesus, Billy, you could
buy and sell this town

39:20.811 --> 39:22.679
and half of fuckin' Cardiff,
too.

39:24.882 --> 39:26.016
No shit, Sherlock.

39:30.387 --> 39:32.756
I'll leave you to it.

39:47.104 --> 39:49.006
Elen, lovely to see you, love.

39:49.039 --> 39:50.341
Oh, you too, Jack.

39:50.374 --> 39:52.143
How are you two getting on,
anyway?

39:52.176 --> 39:54.378
- Mm...
- Oh, you know.

39:54.411 --> 39:55.913
He's a bit of a twat.

39:57.314 --> 39:58.883
You're not wrong there, love.

39:58.916 --> 40:00.717
I know.

40:03.720 --> 40:05.990
Hey.

40:06.023 --> 40:08.225
I have a...
I've got a surprise for you.

40:08.259 --> 40:10.394
Yeah?

40:10.427 --> 40:11.762
It's a good one.

40:18.002 --> 40:20.237
I booked a Caribbean trip.

40:20.271 --> 40:21.805
Huh?

40:21.839 --> 40:22.806
'Member?

40:22.840 --> 40:25.442
We said we'd go.

40:25.476 --> 40:27.178
Did we?

40:27.211 --> 40:29.180
- I thought that was just, uh...
- What?

40:29.213 --> 40:31.115
You know,
like a daydream.

40:31.148 --> 40:32.983
Well, it was

40:33.017 --> 40:36.086
for real.

40:36.120 --> 40:38.489
Not the, uh,
not the yacht,

40:38.522 --> 40:40.824
just the cruise
and the villa.

40:40.858 --> 40:43.894
Thought it'd be a nice,
you know,

40:43.928 --> 40:47.464
couples thing to do.

40:47.498 --> 40:49.466
Right.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.936
So...

40:51.969 --> 40:54.772
you know,
how much?

40:54.805 --> 40:56.907
Six grand in all.

40:56.941 --> 40:59.510
Flights there,
cruise back.

40:59.543 --> 41:01.378
Been saving for months.

41:01.412 --> 41:03.447
For my half, anyway.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.049
Is that all right?

41:07.184 --> 41:08.385
What's the matter?

41:08.419 --> 41:09.987
Well, babe,
I can't afford three grand,

41:10.020 --> 41:12.156
not on the money
that Billy's paying me.

41:12.189 --> 41:14.858
Yeah, but you've got
a credit card haven't you?

41:14.892 --> 41:16.360
No.

41:16.393 --> 41:19.797
- No?
- No!

41:19.830 --> 41:21.432
Well, why the hell not?

41:21.465 --> 41:23.167
Jesus, do you want me
to pay for you?

41:23.200 --> 41:25.135
Well, no, that wouldn't
be right, would it?

41:25.169 --> 41:28.372
No too right
it wouldn't be right.

41:28.405 --> 41:29.907
What about your dad?

41:29.940 --> 41:32.142
What, do you want me
to grovel to my dad for money?

41:32.176 --> 41:33.777
Why not? He can afford it.

41:33.811 --> 41:35.112
Oh, can he, now?

41:35.145 --> 41:36.780
He's loaded,
and he thinks the sun shines

41:36.814 --> 41:38.916
- out your ass, so...
- Fuck you.

41:38.949 --> 41:40.784
Well, don't be like that.

41:40.818 --> 41:42.886
Like what?

41:42.920 --> 41:44.054
You're being childish.

41:52.129 --> 41:54.365
Elen!

41:55.432 --> 41:56.800
Is something wrong?

41:56.834 --> 41:59.169
I'm so sorry!
Butterfingers.

41:59.203 --> 42:00.971
Oh, don't worry about it, love.

42:01.005 --> 42:02.273
- Sorry.
- Listen, let Chris do

42:02.306 --> 42:03.374
the washing up.

42:03.407 --> 42:04.475
Come sit in here with us.

42:04.508 --> 42:06.277
Behave yourself.

42:50.154 --> 42:52.389
I'm sorry.

42:52.423 --> 42:53.991
Oh!

42:54.024 --> 42:56.560
That's really sweet,
but what for?

42:56.593 --> 42:58.629
Well, 'cause you had
to cancel the holiday

42:58.662 --> 43:02.166
and I know you wanted to go.

43:02.199 --> 43:05.936
Yeah, but...
that was my fault, wasn't it?

43:05.969 --> 43:06.970
Was it?

43:07.004 --> 43:09.139
Yeah, I mean,

43:09.173 --> 43:10.874
what the hell was I thinking?

43:10.908 --> 43:15.479
Booking an expensive holiday
without asking you first.

43:15.512 --> 43:16.613
It was selfish of me.

43:16.647 --> 43:17.981
Yeah. It was.

43:20.250 --> 43:22.853
Oh, so you do think
it was my fault.

43:24.655 --> 43:26.290
I mean, yeah.

43:32.563 --> 43:33.964
So easy.

43:33.997 --> 43:36.400
Nice flowers, though.

43:36.433 --> 43:38.602
How 'bout a trip to Bournemouth?

43:38.635 --> 43:39.903
Hm?

43:39.937 --> 43:42.406
Can we manage that?

43:42.439 --> 43:44.908
Yeah. Of course.

43:44.942 --> 43:46.410
Good.

43:46.443 --> 43:48.278
Organize it, then.

43:51.949 --> 43:53.917
God, you really are penniless,
aren't you?

43:53.951 --> 43:56.153
I am, actually.

43:56.186 --> 44:00.257
Aww. That must be so...
emasculating.

44:00.290 --> 44:03.227
- I like being destitute.
- Bullshit.

44:03.260 --> 44:05.529
I mean, you used to be
a bigshot, and...

44:05.562 --> 44:09.233
now look at you.

44:09.266 --> 44:13.570
At least I don't live in a house
that my father bought for me.

44:13.604 --> 44:15.639
That's really uncalled for.

44:15.672 --> 44:17.207
I've...

44:17.241 --> 44:18.642
I can't believe
you just said that to me.

44:18.675 --> 44:21.412
That was a joke!

44:21.445 --> 44:25.215
Oh, you are such a wind-up.

44:25.249 --> 44:30.120
And I did have a job, actually.

44:30.154 --> 44:33.690
Little shop, in fact,

44:33.724 --> 44:36.193
but Billy didn't like
me doing it, so.

44:36.226 --> 44:38.195
Why not?

44:38.228 --> 44:42.966
Didn't like me being
too independent.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.301
Tell you what.

44:44.334 --> 44:45.569
I'll pay for Bournemouth.

44:45.602 --> 44:47.137
- No, you ca...
- Yes.

44:47.171 --> 44:50.474
Hotels, meals, the lot.

44:50.507 --> 44:54.244
And remind me
why I'll pay for it.

44:54.278 --> 44:56.547
No idea.

44:56.580 --> 45:04.221
Because even though
you are a bit of a twat...

45:04.254 --> 45:05.389
I love ya.

45:07.357 --> 45:10.027
You need to look at this.

45:10.060 --> 45:13.130
What's the problem?

45:13.163 --> 45:19.102
So, look at the items
that I've marked in yellow.

45:19.136 --> 45:20.571
Uh-huh. Not seeing it.

45:20.604 --> 45:22.339
Now look at the suppliers.

45:22.372 --> 45:24.408
Recognize the names?

45:24.441 --> 45:26.210
- No.
- No, that's the point.

45:26.243 --> 45:27.744
They're not our suppliers.

45:27.779 --> 45:30.113
The items in green
are our suppliers.

45:30.147 --> 45:32.249
You've paid McKinley
to set up a quarry in Pyle,

45:32.282 --> 45:35.152
but he's buying quarry vehicles
twice.

45:35.185 --> 45:37.054
Once from a real dealership,

45:37.087 --> 45:39.456
and then another from
a dealership that doesn't exist.

45:39.490 --> 45:42.659
So he's charging us a fortune
for excavators and dump trucks

45:42.693 --> 45:44.061
that don't exist

45:44.094 --> 45:45.496
and pocketing the money
for himself.

45:45.529 --> 45:47.731
- No, that's not possible.
- Yes it is.

45:47.765 --> 45:50.200
I've tracked and double-checked
every transaction.

45:50.234 --> 45:52.503
The numbers just don't add up.

45:52.536 --> 45:56.540
McKinley is robbing you blind.

46:00.110 --> 46:02.646
Well, I'm impressed, actually.

46:02.679 --> 46:03.815
I didn't think
the little bastard

46:03.848 --> 46:06.416
had it in him.

46:06.450 --> 46:07.551
Shall I call the police?

46:07.584 --> 46:09.520
Nah, nah.

46:09.553 --> 46:12.824
No, McKinley and I
are old pals.

46:12.857 --> 46:15.492
Yeah, he's always
up to something.

46:15.526 --> 46:18.695
So what are you gonna do,
just write it off?

46:18.729 --> 46:22.599
Well, might ask him
to pay me back.

46:22.633 --> 46:24.334
- Really?
- Yeah.

46:24.368 --> 46:25.502
Come with me.

46:50.594 --> 46:52.229
All right, Billy.

46:52.262 --> 46:54.097
Hi!

46:54.131 --> 46:55.800
Good to see you, Frankie.

46:57.701 --> 46:59.536
I'll buy you a pint.

46:59.570 --> 47:01.672
That'll be a first.

47:01.705 --> 47:02.774
Three pints, man.

47:02.807 --> 47:05.709
You tight Scottish bastard.

47:06.878 --> 47:08.579
Bad news, gents.

47:08.612 --> 47:11.849
There's been a bit of
discrepancy in books.

47:15.820 --> 47:17.454
Who's this, Bill?

47:17.487 --> 47:20.557
This? Jack Blythe's boy.

47:22.459 --> 47:25.596
I never liked Jack.

47:25.629 --> 47:29.600
I always thought he was
a bit of an arse licker.

47:32.837 --> 47:33.838
You know what?

47:33.871 --> 47:35.840
I agree with you, Frankie.

47:35.873 --> 47:37.909
I used to say to him,
"Jack, you're nothin' but

47:37.942 --> 47:41.244
a little prick,
and nobody likes you."

47:42.412 --> 47:43.280
And you know what?

47:43.313 --> 47:44.615
He agreed with me.

47:44.648 --> 47:46.550
I mean, can you believe him?

47:46.583 --> 47:48.285
What a fuckin' fanny.

47:50.220 --> 47:52.222
Ah, Chris.

47:58.930 --> 48:01.598
Come on, then.

48:01.632 --> 48:04.534
Stay outta this, pal.

48:18.682 --> 48:21.485
Now, Frankie,

48:21.518 --> 48:22.686
you're gonna pay me back

48:22.719 --> 48:26.223
every single fuckin'
penny you owe me.

48:26.256 --> 48:27.925
Yeah?

48:27.959 --> 48:30.962
Even if you have to
sell your house.

48:33.263 --> 48:35.599
I'll fix it, Billy.

48:35.632 --> 48:37.300
I'll make it good.

48:37.334 --> 48:38.535
Yeah.

48:38.568 --> 48:39.937
Good, mate.

48:48.780 --> 48:50.747
You heard what he said

48:50.782 --> 48:53.283
about your dad.

48:58.756 --> 49:01.826
Hit him!

49:03.928 --> 49:07.531
Go on,

49:07.564 --> 49:10.600
hit him.

49:10.634 --> 49:12.436
Go on, son.

49:14.772 --> 49:16.908
Fuckin' hit him.

49:32.322 --> 49:34.959
You should quit.

49:34.992 --> 49:36.994
Why?

49:37.028 --> 49:38.528
Why?

49:38.562 --> 49:40.464
'Cause my father's
a fucking psychopath,

49:40.497 --> 49:41.966
that's why.

49:44.601 --> 49:45.635
Jeez, look at you.

49:45.669 --> 49:48.438
Yeah, it's fine,
it's fine, it's fine.

49:51.809 --> 49:54.344
You should move on.

49:54.377 --> 49:56.680
You know,

49:56.713 --> 49:58.381
stand up on your own.

49:58.415 --> 49:59.784
You said you wanted to do that.

49:59.817 --> 50:02.787
There's potential where I am.

50:02.820 --> 50:05.990
I'm movin' my way up.

50:06.023 --> 50:08.760
I'll be Billy's
partner in the future.

50:10.460 --> 50:11.294
I actually reckon he's gonna

50:11.328 --> 50:13.663
- ask me.
- Bullshit.

50:13.697 --> 50:15.767
Billy's just fuckin' with you.

50:18.635 --> 50:20.037
Please, just,

50:20.071 --> 50:21.973
just give me some time.

51:15.159 --> 51:17.561
You sure you wanna do this?

51:17.594 --> 51:20.397
I'll see you in court, Bill.

51:33.677 --> 51:35.612
You wanted to talk to me?

51:45.189 --> 51:47.859
Elen,

51:47.892 --> 51:49.126
is she happy?

51:49.160 --> 51:52.063
Yeah, I hope so.

51:52.096 --> 51:53.597
That's good.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.802
Because if I ever
hear she isn't,

51:57.835 --> 52:00.171
you're a dead man.

52:00.204 --> 52:01.806
Billy, you're a charmer.

52:01.839 --> 52:02.773
So they tell me.

52:02.807 --> 52:05.042
- Iechyd da!
- Slàinte.

52:13.516 --> 52:15.953
I've just got my date
for the committal hearing,

52:15.987 --> 52:19.156
GBH, alleged GBH,

52:19.190 --> 52:20.858
Mike Clark.

52:24.061 --> 52:27.664
Yeah, but I'm not
too worried, though.

52:27.697 --> 52:30.700
Mike's a good boy.

52:30.734 --> 52:34.604
He wouldn't dare
testify against me.

52:34.638 --> 52:37.041
I'm sure you're right.

52:37.074 --> 52:39.877
And what if I'm wrong, Chris?

52:39.911 --> 52:42.579
What if I do go to jail?

52:42.612 --> 52:44.714
What happens then?

52:44.748 --> 52:46.050
To Elen, you mean?

52:46.083 --> 52:47.184
Everything.

52:47.218 --> 52:50.553
Elen, the businesses.

52:50.587 --> 52:53.891
Will you run
the quarry for me, Chris?

52:53.925 --> 52:56.027
Will you do that for me?

52:56.060 --> 52:58.095
Yeah, sure, Bill.

53:03.968 --> 53:06.771
In your dreams,
you fuckin' fanny!

53:09.739 --> 53:11.208
Touché!

53:13.911 --> 53:16.781
Canada.

53:16.814 --> 53:18.748
I did some checking.

53:18.783 --> 53:21.218
Your haulage business.

53:21.252 --> 53:25.488
Your partner didn't rob you,
you robbed him.

53:25.522 --> 53:27.624
It's more complicated than that.

53:27.657 --> 53:31.062
Yeah, you cheated on him,
and then he died.

53:31.095 --> 53:33.730
That was pretty handy,
wasn't it?

53:33.764 --> 53:36.233
What are you implying, Bill?

53:36.267 --> 53:39.070
Nothing!

53:39.103 --> 53:41.238
Except I know his
death was suspicious.

53:41.272 --> 53:43.740
I know the Canadian
police interrogated you

53:43.774 --> 53:46.010
for hours on end.

53:46.043 --> 53:48.012
You cheated on him, he died,

53:48.045 --> 53:50.580
they seized your assets,
you ended up in prison,

53:50.613 --> 53:52.716
you fuckin' diddy.

53:54.151 --> 53:56.988
You've got nasty
temper in you, son.

54:03.593 --> 54:06.097
I thought you were
a little smarter.

54:08.732 --> 54:11.302
Oh, for fuck's sake, Billy,

54:11.335 --> 54:13.670
come on.

54:13.703 --> 54:16.073
You know the craic.

54:16.107 --> 54:19.977
So I had my fingers
burned, so what?

54:20.011 --> 54:23.613
Nobody ever got rich without
breakin' a few fuckin' laws.

54:26.350 --> 54:28.219
That's my boy,
now you're talkin',

54:28.252 --> 54:30.221
you're gettin' it,
you're catchin' up.

54:30.254 --> 54:33.958
It's fuckin' business,
never forget that.

54:33.991 --> 54:36.794
I don't give a shit
what you did in Canada,

54:36.827 --> 54:38.996
but don't tell Elen.

54:39.030 --> 54:41.999
Let's just keep it
to ourselves, huh?

54:42.033 --> 54:43.300
Yeah.

54:43.334 --> 54:45.036
Yeah, sure.

54:54.111 --> 54:57.815
So I had an idea,

54:57.848 --> 54:59.649
a little business proposition.

54:59.682 --> 55:01.052
Hm!

55:01.085 --> 55:03.854
But if I bring it your way,
what's in it for me?

55:06.090 --> 55:07.958
Profit share.

55:07.992 --> 55:10.194
Sounds good.

55:10.227 --> 55:13.663
- 50/50.
- 50/50.

55:13.696 --> 55:15.665
- Really?
- Yeah.

55:15.698 --> 55:18.069
Come on.

55:18.102 --> 55:19.303
Let's go.

55:22.672 --> 55:24.108
I got a job for you, kid.

55:24.141 --> 55:25.742
Good boy.

56:16.026 --> 56:18.162
Don't fuckin' do it, Bill.

56:40.117 --> 56:41.418
Oh, shit.

56:55.099 --> 56:57.067
I told you never

56:57.101 --> 57:00.437
to mess with Billy ever again!

57:00.471 --> 57:01.338
I'm sorry.

57:01.372 --> 57:03.240
- Baby...
- Get off me!

57:05.242 --> 57:08.145
Look at the state of this place!

57:15.219 --> 57:16.320
- Elen.
- All right, Rhian?

57:16.353 --> 57:18.389
No.

57:18.422 --> 57:20.391
We need to talk.

57:24.328 --> 57:25.763
Sorry, love, I can't help you.

57:25.796 --> 57:27.898
You just gonna
turn your back, are you?

57:27.932 --> 57:30.301
We need to speak
woman to woman!

57:47.084 --> 57:48.519
Yeah?

58:15.980 --> 58:18.082
You win.

58:56.387 --> 58:57.988
You okay?

58:58.022 --> 58:59.456
Fine.

59:04.595 --> 59:07.398
I'm not fine.

59:07.431 --> 59:09.600
I'm really pissed off, actually.

59:16.307 --> 59:18.075
I saw, um,

59:18.108 --> 59:20.110
Rhian Clark today.

59:20.144 --> 59:22.046
Oh, yeah?

59:22.079 --> 59:23.847
Mm.

59:26.216 --> 59:28.352
You know, Mike's
dropped the charges.

59:30.020 --> 59:31.955
Yeah, I heard about that.

59:35.592 --> 59:38.095
And do you know why?

59:38.128 --> 59:39.530
No idea.

59:46.437 --> 59:48.439
Chris, I'd like to leave.

59:51.608 --> 59:53.544
I wanna get away from here.

59:55.412 --> 59:57.881
Cardiff, London, anywhere.

1:00:00.517 --> 1:00:02.353
Will you come with me?

1:00:05.989 --> 1:00:08.325
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1:00:10.060 --> 1:00:11.295
And marry me.

1:00:11.328 --> 1:00:12.996
Will you marry me?

1:00:13.030 --> 1:00:14.631
What?

1:00:17.101 --> 1:00:19.603
I'm serious.

1:00:19.636 --> 1:00:21.438
Chris, will you marry me?

1:00:34.518 --> 1:00:36.220
Well, yeah!

1:00:45.496 --> 1:00:48.232
God, I didn't know
if you'd show.

1:00:48.265 --> 1:00:52.002
Uh, ugh,

1:00:52.035 --> 1:00:53.670
okay.

1:00:53.704 --> 1:00:56.306
When can we go?

1:00:56.340 --> 1:00:58.175
Well, we need to
talk about this.

1:00:58.208 --> 1:01:01.044
Marriage is one thing,
moving is another.

1:01:01.078 --> 1:01:02.379
Next week? Week after next?

1:01:02.413 --> 1:01:04.281
Like, how much notice
do you need to give?

1:01:04.314 --> 1:01:06.016
Why, it's just

1:01:06.049 --> 1:01:09.353
not as simple as that.

1:01:09.386 --> 1:01:11.455
We can figure out the finances.

1:01:13.090 --> 1:01:15.259
It'll be a fresh start.

1:01:17.060 --> 1:01:18.429
Okay.

1:01:20.097 --> 1:01:23.667
One year, two years, maybe?

1:01:23.700 --> 1:01:26.603
Chris, are you listening
to anything I'm saying?

1:01:26.637 --> 1:01:29.740
Elen, look,

1:01:29.774 --> 1:01:33.477
I've laid a foundation
here with Billy.

1:01:33.510 --> 1:01:36.146
Billy is the one
who's driving me away!

1:01:38.115 --> 1:01:39.583
He's a fuckin' bastard!

1:01:39.616 --> 1:01:41.084
Yeah, I've heard that.

1:01:41.118 --> 1:01:43.587
He's a fucking
controlling bastard.

1:01:45.322 --> 1:01:47.090
He owns this house.

1:01:47.124 --> 1:01:48.592
He owns the car.

1:01:48.625 --> 1:01:50.461
He fucking owns you.

1:01:50.494 --> 1:01:53.030
- What?
- He fucking owns you.

1:01:56.700 --> 1:01:59.703
Look, I'm sorry.

1:01:59.736 --> 1:02:02.005
Babe,

1:02:02.039 --> 1:02:04.741
I have a deal

1:02:04.776 --> 1:02:07.478
here with Billy.

1:02:07.511 --> 1:02:11.348
So you, you just
need to be patient.

1:02:11.381 --> 1:02:12.716
Okay?

1:02:14.585 --> 1:02:16.487
Okay?

1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:18.422
Yeah.

1:02:18.455 --> 1:02:20.591
- Come here.
- Okay.

1:02:36.273 --> 1:02:37.441
Hm.

1:02:41.411 --> 1:02:42.679
Billy!

1:02:48.085 --> 1:02:50.354
- Whoa, babe, babe.
- Stop!

1:02:50.387 --> 1:02:52.322
Shh, shh.

1:02:52.356 --> 1:02:54.491
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1:03:33.430 --> 1:03:37.301
Me and Chris are
goin' on a trip today

1:03:37.334 --> 1:03:40.437
into the valleys.

1:03:40.470 --> 1:03:42.406
Yeah.

1:03:42.439 --> 1:03:44.541
He said he had
a deal to pitch you.

1:03:44.575 --> 1:03:47.244
Full of ideas,
that boy of yours.

1:03:47.277 --> 1:03:49.446
Is he?

1:03:49.479 --> 1:03:50.581
Aye.

1:03:50.614 --> 1:03:52.482
He's a good lad.

1:03:52.516 --> 1:03:54.786
If he sticks with me,
he'll go far.

1:03:55.920 --> 1:03:57.721
Not too far though.

1:04:03.727 --> 1:04:05.562
He's not staying, you know.

1:04:08.198 --> 1:04:10.500
What?

1:04:10.534 --> 1:04:13.637
No, no, we're leaving.

1:04:15.505 --> 1:04:18.575
London, probably.

1:04:18.609 --> 1:04:21.178
That worked well
the last time, didn't it?

1:04:21.211 --> 1:04:22.412
Hm!

1:04:25.349 --> 1:04:27.517
We're gonna make
a new life for ourselves,

1:04:27.551 --> 1:04:30.287
Chris and I,
away from you,

1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:32.723
- you miserable fuck.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:04:32.757 --> 1:04:34.224
Do as you like.

1:04:37.628 --> 1:04:40.397
Yeah, you do what you like,
but I'll tell you one thing.

1:04:40.430 --> 1:04:42.934
If you leave this town,
you'll get nothing from me.

1:04:45.369 --> 1:04:47.504
You know what I'm saying?

1:04:47.537 --> 1:04:51.441
When I'm dead and gone...

1:04:51.475 --> 1:04:52.944
nothing.

1:05:12.262 --> 1:05:15.499
So...

1:05:15.532 --> 1:05:17.802
This is your big idea?

1:05:17.835 --> 1:05:20.704
Slag heaps?

1:05:20.737 --> 1:05:23.740
It's blighted land, Bill.

1:05:23.775 --> 1:05:25.742
Means it's cheap.

1:05:25.777 --> 1:05:28.378
A lot cheaper than
the slag at the steel works.

1:05:43.995 --> 1:05:48.833
So, you're saying buy the land?

1:05:48.866 --> 1:05:52.235
Buy the land,
and sell the slag.

1:05:52.269 --> 1:05:53.737
Then wait a few years,

1:05:53.771 --> 1:05:56.908
and sell the land
when the market turns.

1:05:56.941 --> 1:05:58.776
You'll make millions.

1:06:01.344 --> 1:06:03.313
Okay.

1:06:03.346 --> 1:06:04.347
What?

1:06:04.381 --> 1:06:05.817
I said okay.

1:06:05.850 --> 1:06:08.351
- I'll do it.
- Great!

1:06:08.385 --> 1:06:11.756
Then, we should get a lawyer to

1:06:11.789 --> 1:06:15.592
draft up a deed between us
and make it clear.

1:06:15.625 --> 1:06:18.261
Are you... What?

1:06:18.295 --> 1:06:19.997
Our split.

1:06:20.031 --> 1:06:22.699
You said that if you
liked the deal,

1:06:22.733 --> 1:06:24.668
we'd split it 50/50.

1:06:24.701 --> 1:06:27.471
Now when did I say that?

1:06:27.504 --> 1:06:30.674
Fuck off, 50/50.

1:06:32.709 --> 1:06:34.846
Not on a deal this big, son.

1:06:36.848 --> 1:06:38.381
You're kidding, right?

1:06:38.415 --> 1:06:40.818
You can always sue me.

1:06:40.852 --> 1:06:41.786
Huh?

1:06:41.819 --> 1:06:43.453
Think you can afford it?

1:06:45.622 --> 1:06:48.425
Come on, look.

1:06:48.458 --> 1:06:50.895
This is a long-term commitment.

1:06:50.928 --> 1:06:53.330
It's my capital that's at risk.

1:06:53.363 --> 1:06:55.967
Give you a wage rise,
Christmas bonus.

1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.069
I'll see you all right.

1:06:58.102 --> 1:07:01.839
But 50-fucking-50, no way.

1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:04.809
We had a deal.

1:07:08.678 --> 1:07:11.048
Do you know who I am?

1:07:15.787 --> 1:07:18.388
Do you have any idea

1:07:18.421 --> 1:07:20.423
what the fuck I did

1:07:20.457 --> 1:07:23.326
to get to be me?

1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:24.661
No.

1:07:24.694 --> 1:07:26.329
I came from poor Glasgow

1:07:26.363 --> 1:07:28.632
to this godforsaken shitehole

1:07:28.665 --> 1:07:31.635
with two broken fists
and nothing,

1:07:31.668 --> 1:07:34.105
nothing, nothing

1:07:34.138 --> 1:07:35.940
in my pockets.

1:07:35.973 --> 1:07:39.911
So don't you even
begin to dare to tell me

1:07:39.944 --> 1:07:42.013
what's...

1:07:42.046 --> 1:07:44.581
But you're showin' promise,
though, son.

1:07:44.614 --> 1:07:46.918
You're showin' promise.

1:07:46.951 --> 1:07:49.921
Keep it up.

1:07:49.954 --> 1:07:51.688
We had a deal, Bill.

1:07:51.721 --> 1:07:55.059
Oh, grow up!

1:07:55.092 --> 1:07:56.828
Come on, let's go.

1:08:01.398 --> 1:08:03.134
I'll make my own way back.

1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:24.889
Elen?

1:08:39.469 --> 1:08:41.705
Elen?

1:08:41.738 --> 1:08:43.040
Babe?

1:08:45.508 --> 1:08:47.677
Babe?

1:08:47.711 --> 1:08:48.846
Elen, it's Chris.

1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:50.882
Babe?

1:08:50.915 --> 1:08:53.084
You okay?

1:08:53.117 --> 1:08:54.852
Babe, what happened?

1:08:57.154 --> 1:08:59.023
It was Billy.

1:08:59.056 --> 1:09:03.094
He had one of his
episodes at breakfast.

1:09:03.127 --> 1:09:05.162
What?

1:09:05.196 --> 1:09:06.764
Babe, look at me.

1:09:06.797 --> 1:09:08.598
It's okay, look at me.

1:09:08.632 --> 1:09:10.700
Please.

1:09:10.734 --> 1:09:12.535
Elen.

1:09:15.739 --> 1:09:18.109
Oh, my God,
Elen, did Billy do this?

1:09:20.710 --> 1:09:22.612
Did he do this?

1:09:25.983 --> 1:09:28.451
Has he done this before?

1:09:34.859 --> 1:09:39.562
When Martin and I
were kids, it was worse.

1:09:39.596 --> 1:09:42.565
The fuck is Martin?

1:09:42.599 --> 1:09:44.534
He's my brother.

1:09:44.567 --> 1:09:45.903
He died when I was 12.

1:09:45.937 --> 1:09:48.039
What? How?

1:09:48.072 --> 1:09:49.639
Brain tumor.

1:09:53.945 --> 1:09:57.747
Dad doesn't let me
speak about him.

1:09:57.782 --> 1:10:00.151
That's why there are no
pictures of him.

1:10:04.055 --> 1:10:05.522
He won't let me visit his grave.

1:10:05.555 --> 1:10:07.792
It's like he never existed.

1:10:07.825 --> 1:10:09.794
God, fuck's sake.

1:10:16.533 --> 1:10:18.135
That's why Mom left.

1:10:18.169 --> 1:10:20.004
He drove her away.

1:10:23.640 --> 1:10:25.242
Billy has his rules, see,

1:10:25.276 --> 1:10:27.644
and Mom and I had to learn,

1:10:27.677 --> 1:10:31.015
live by them.

1:10:31.048 --> 1:10:33.117
Where the fuck
is that little prick?

1:10:33.150 --> 1:10:34.651
No, no, Chris,

1:10:34.684 --> 1:10:37.955
- no, no, you don't.
- I will fucking kill him.

1:10:37.989 --> 1:10:40.224
No, Chris, no, you don't.

1:10:40.257 --> 1:10:41.125
Then we'll leave this shit hole.

1:10:41.158 --> 1:10:44.996
No, no, no, no,
I'll get nothin'.

1:10:45.029 --> 1:10:45.863
I'll get nothin'.

1:10:45.896 --> 1:10:48.199
He told me that,
he said if I leave,

1:10:48.232 --> 1:10:51.202
I get nothin'.

1:10:51.235 --> 1:10:53.137
All the shit I've
had to put up with,

1:10:53.170 --> 1:10:55.006
and I'd get nothin'.

1:11:01.644 --> 1:11:03.747
I won't let him hurt you again.

1:11:07.218 --> 1:11:10.687
I'm scared.

1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:12.289
He won't touch you again.

1:11:12.323 --> 1:11:13.958
Okay?

1:12:52.857 --> 1:12:54.024
Bill.

1:13:00.097 --> 1:13:01.899
You're gonna pay
for what you fuckin' did.

1:13:01.932 --> 1:13:03.901
What the fuck?

1:13:03.934 --> 1:13:05.803
What the fuck is goin' on, son?

1:13:05.836 --> 1:13:07.938
- You know.
- Know what?

1:13:07.972 --> 1:13:09.840
You fuckin' know.

1:13:09.874 --> 1:13:11.442
- Is this about the slag deal?
- No.

1:13:11.475 --> 1:13:15.346
Jesus fuckin' Christ, son,
grow up, that was business.

1:13:15.379 --> 1:13:19.083
Look, why don't you
put that down?

1:13:19.116 --> 1:13:20.885
Give me the crowbar.

1:13:20.918 --> 1:13:22.019
Come on, son,

1:13:22.052 --> 1:13:23.354
give me the crowbar.

1:13:23.387 --> 1:13:24.788
Let's just pretend

1:13:24.822 --> 1:13:26.357
this ain't happening.

1:13:28.192 --> 1:13:31.762
Now you give me the crowbar.

1:13:31.795 --> 1:13:34.999
Come on, you're gonna
fuck everything up, son.

1:13:35.032 --> 1:13:37.134
You got a good
future ahead of you.

1:13:37.168 --> 1:13:39.203
Don't blow it.

1:13:39.236 --> 1:13:40.804
Come on.

1:13:43.307 --> 1:13:45.476
Good boy.

1:13:51.882 --> 1:13:53.450
You fuckin' idiot.

1:13:53.484 --> 1:13:55.953
You're finished,
you son of a...

1:13:55.986 --> 1:13:58.055
You piece of shit!

1:13:59.423 --> 1:14:01.992
I know what you fucking did!

1:14:04.061 --> 1:14:06.430
And I won't let you
fucking do it again.

1:14:06.463 --> 1:14:08.933
You won't hurt her again,
you bastard!

1:14:52.076 --> 1:14:53.777
Chris?

1:14:55.813 --> 1:14:57.181
What happened?

1:14:59.883 --> 1:15:02.453
Chris?

1:15:02.486 --> 1:15:03.954
What happened?

1:15:27.611 --> 1:15:30.381
Continuing interview
with Christopher Blythe.

1:15:30.414 --> 1:15:33.984
Wednesday November 3rd at 6:30.

1:15:34.018 --> 1:15:37.054
DI Perry and DS Reilly present.

1:15:37.087 --> 1:15:39.890
So let's go through
this again, son.

1:15:39.923 --> 1:15:42.526
- Frank McKinley...
- I've told you!

1:15:42.559 --> 1:15:44.928
It was bad blood between them.

1:15:44.962 --> 1:15:47.031
McKinley was ripping
Billy off big time.

1:15:47.064 --> 1:15:50.134
I found out and I told
Billy about it, that's...

1:15:50.167 --> 1:15:51.468
He went fucking nuts.

1:15:51.502 --> 1:15:53.504
Why didn't you come to us?

1:15:53.537 --> 1:15:54.538
I wanted to call you guys

1:15:54.571 --> 1:15:56.407
and go through the proper
channels, you know,

1:15:56.440 --> 1:16:00.010
but Billy, he said
he'd handle it his way,

1:16:00.044 --> 1:16:03.614
and it was fuckin' brutal.

1:16:03.647 --> 1:16:05.983
This car you say you saw,

1:16:06.016 --> 1:16:08.118
you're suggesting
that was McKinley?

1:16:08.152 --> 1:16:10.921
I don't know,
I don't fucking know!

1:16:10.954 --> 1:16:12.523
I saw a car

1:16:12.556 --> 1:16:14.958
driving away on the north
quarry approach road

1:16:14.992 --> 1:16:16.260
by the workshop.

1:16:16.293 --> 1:16:17.928
I didn't, I didn't recognize it.

1:16:17.961 --> 1:16:19.263
It was a...

1:16:19.296 --> 1:16:21.899
a Jag? A beat up
old Jag, I think?

1:16:21.932 --> 1:16:23.634
- Silver.
- And then?

1:16:23.667 --> 1:16:25.936
And that's when I found Billy.

1:16:27.504 --> 1:16:31.075
Look, I know you guys
had your issues with Billy,

1:16:31.108 --> 1:16:33.911
but...

1:16:33.944 --> 1:16:35.979
but he didn't deserve
to die like that.

1:20:27.277 --> 1:20:28.813
Chris.

1:20:30.180 --> 1:20:31.448
Dorien.

1:20:31.481 --> 1:20:32.716
Big day.

1:20:34.484 --> 1:20:36.653
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1:20:36.687 --> 1:20:40.123
She looks cracking,
I can't deny it.

1:20:40.157 --> 1:20:41.325
Yeah, thanks.

1:20:41.358 --> 1:20:42.794
I gotta tell you this, look,

1:20:42.827 --> 1:20:45.629
that woman,
she's fuckin' insane.

1:20:45.662 --> 1:20:47.698
Okay, look, don't just
turn up to my wedding

1:20:47.731 --> 1:20:50.233
- and start this fuckin' shit.
- I mean it!

1:20:50.267 --> 1:20:52.302
She's fuckin' cracked.

1:20:52.336 --> 1:20:54.471
She tells lies.

1:20:54.504 --> 1:20:55.873
She can't help herself.

1:20:55.907 --> 1:20:57.407
- She can't.
- Okay, you know what?

1:20:57.441 --> 1:20:58.442
I think you should just

1:20:58.475 --> 1:21:02.546
- fuck off, Dorien.
- She tell you about Martin?

1:21:02.579 --> 1:21:06.216
Yeah, her brother,
died when she was a kid.

1:21:06.249 --> 1:21:07.584
She never had a brother.

1:21:11.355 --> 1:21:12.656
That's bollocks!

1:21:12.689 --> 1:21:13.657
Listen,

1:21:13.690 --> 1:21:15.425
she's the queen of lies!

1:21:15.459 --> 1:21:16.560
If she told me
it was a sunny day,

1:21:16.593 --> 1:21:18.295
I'd buy a fuckin' umbrella.

1:21:20.397 --> 1:21:22.165
She used to tell me Billy

1:21:22.199 --> 1:21:23.500
stopped her from being a singer,

1:21:23.533 --> 1:21:24.902
stopped her
following her dreams.

1:21:24.936 --> 1:21:26.336
Yeah, 'cause he didn't like her

1:21:26.370 --> 1:21:30.273
- being independent.
- Independent.

1:21:30.307 --> 1:21:32.175
It's all bullshit.

1:21:32.209 --> 1:21:34.444
She did go to London
to be a singer,

1:21:34.478 --> 1:21:35.479
but she blew it.

1:21:35.512 --> 1:21:38.749
She was partying
every night, takin' drugs.

1:21:38.783 --> 1:21:40.818
Billy had to go up there
and fetch her home.

1:21:40.852 --> 1:21:42.419
She was wreck.

1:21:42.452 --> 1:21:44.756
Billy saved her life, I reckon.

1:21:44.789 --> 1:21:48.725
One time, Elen even told me
Billy used to hit her.

1:21:48.760 --> 1:21:50.327
He did.

1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:53.363
- He was an abusive father.
- No!

1:21:53.397 --> 1:21:54.799
Never.

1:21:54.832 --> 1:21:56.466
He was a prick,

1:21:56.500 --> 1:21:57.869
but he loved her.

1:22:00.337 --> 1:22:02.339
She does that shit to herself.

1:22:10.982 --> 1:22:13.684
I walked in on her,

1:22:13.717 --> 1:22:15.552
caught her doin' it.

1:22:18.255 --> 1:22:21.224
She's fuckin' cracked,
she tells lies.

1:22:23.393 --> 1:22:25.328
I wanted to kill
that fuckin' bastard

1:22:25.362 --> 1:22:28.331
like any good husband would,

1:22:28.365 --> 1:22:30.400
until I saw her doin' that.

1:23:18.582 --> 1:23:20.317
Hm.

1:23:23.386 --> 1:23:26.423
Your mother's
had a few, hasn't she?

1:23:29.359 --> 1:23:30.727
Chris?

1:23:33.363 --> 1:23:35.432
Hello?

1:23:35.465 --> 1:23:37.367
Where are you?

1:23:37.400 --> 1:23:40.037
Hm?

1:23:40.071 --> 1:23:42.606
It's a shame your
mum can't be here.

1:23:44.876 --> 1:23:46.376
Mm.

1:23:48.545 --> 1:23:51.615
Gosh, she would have loved this.

1:23:51.648 --> 1:23:54.751
And, of course,
your brother Martin.

1:23:56.653 --> 1:23:58.488
Yeah.

1:24:01.458 --> 1:24:03.861
Yeah, I miss them both.

1:24:07.865 --> 1:24:09.733
I know you're a liar, Elen.

1:24:12.369 --> 1:24:15.739
What?

1:24:15.773 --> 1:24:19.409
I know you're lying.

1:24:19.442 --> 1:24:21.378
I spoke to Dorien.

1:24:25.482 --> 1:24:29.086
Okay, what's he been sayin' now?

1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:32.023
There was no fucking
Martin, was there?

1:24:34.491 --> 1:24:35.893
I'm sorry?

1:24:38.029 --> 1:24:42.632
There was no Martin, was there?

1:24:42.666 --> 1:24:45.569
I don't, I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

1:24:57.782 --> 1:25:01.018
Look, I was lonely when
I was a kid, so I made him up.

1:25:01.052 --> 1:25:02.452
So what?

1:25:04.956 --> 1:25:07.792
And Billy?

1:25:07.825 --> 1:25:10.161
Billy was a bastard.

1:25:10.194 --> 1:25:11.494
You know that.

1:25:11.528 --> 1:25:14.098
Yeah, but he never
hit you, did he?

1:25:21.973 --> 1:25:24.507
He never did any of the things
that you said he did, did he?

1:25:28.612 --> 1:25:30.848
Do you know what you made me do?

1:25:30.882 --> 1:25:33.717
Chris, listen to me,
listen to me.

1:25:33.750 --> 1:25:36.120
I did it for us.

1:25:36.153 --> 1:25:38.823
I did it for the both of us.

1:25:42.059 --> 1:25:45.695
Look, we're free now.

1:25:45.729 --> 1:25:47.932
You made me a murderer.

1:25:52.169 --> 1:25:55.873
I didn't make you do anything!

1:25:55.907 --> 1:25:58.809
You didn't kill Billy for me.

1:25:58.843 --> 1:26:02.113
You did it for yourself,

1:26:02.146 --> 1:26:04.547
so you could marry
a rich fuckin' orphan.

1:26:04.581 --> 1:26:06.183
- No.
- Yes.

1:26:06.217 --> 1:26:08.752
And you're a liar too,
and a crook.

1:26:08.786 --> 1:26:10.553
I know all about Canada.

1:26:10.587 --> 1:26:11.923
Dad told me.

1:26:11.956 --> 1:26:14.959
He showed me the press cuttings.

1:26:14.992 --> 1:26:17.828
You were arrested for murder.

1:26:17.862 --> 1:26:18.930
- No.
- Yeah.

1:26:18.963 --> 1:26:21.564
That is not what happened!

1:26:21.598 --> 1:26:24.001
Jesus, Elen.

1:26:24.035 --> 1:26:26.636
I am innocent.

1:26:26.670 --> 1:26:29.606
I was proven innocent.

1:26:29.639 --> 1:26:32.910
- It never even went to trial.
- Bullshit.

1:26:32.944 --> 1:26:35.880
You beat your partner up,

1:26:35.913 --> 1:26:37.747
and then you killed him.

1:26:37.782 --> 1:26:39.716
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

1:26:39.749 --> 1:26:42.186
Billy's twisted it all.

1:26:42.219 --> 1:26:44.822
Yes, I had a fight
with my partner.

1:26:44.855 --> 1:26:46.257
Yes, he died,

1:26:46.290 --> 1:26:50.694
but he died a week later
from natural causes.

1:26:50.727 --> 1:26:53.596
Nothing to do with the fight.

1:26:53.630 --> 1:26:56.200
That was proven in
the second post-mortem.

1:26:56.233 --> 1:26:57.500
I am innocent!

1:26:57.534 --> 1:27:00.204
I am not, I am not,

1:27:00.237 --> 1:27:02.672
I'm not a murderer!

1:27:04.674 --> 1:27:06.844
Well now

1:27:06.877 --> 1:27:08.478
you are.

1:27:15.552 --> 1:27:17.188
Look at me.

1:27:21.225 --> 1:27:23.060
I hate you.

1:27:23.094 --> 1:27:26.663
I wish I'd never
fuckin' met you.

1:27:28.598 --> 1:27:30.968
Don't you turn your back on me!

1:27:31.002 --> 1:27:33.737
Don't you dare fuckin'
turn your back on me, Chris.

1:27:33.771 --> 1:27:35.072
Chris, you know I love you.

1:27:35.106 --> 1:27:37.208
You know I love you,
and I know you love me too.

1:27:37.241 --> 1:27:40.244
- Say it.
- Get off me.

1:27:44.315 --> 1:27:45.182
You don't leave me.

1:27:45.216 --> 1:27:48.853
Nobody fuckin' leaves me!

1:27:48.886 --> 1:27:50.754
You bastard!

1:27:50.788 --> 1:27:52.289
You fuckin' bastard!

1:28:00.865 --> 1:28:02.133
I know you love me.

1:28:02.166 --> 1:28:05.702
Tell me you love me, say it.

1:28:05.735 --> 1:28:08.873
Tell me you love me.

1:28:08.906 --> 1:28:10.107
Chris?

1:28:12.009 --> 1:28:13.277
Chris.
