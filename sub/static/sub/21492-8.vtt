00:04.739 --> 00:07.175
Previously on "Mr. Mercedes"...

00:07.375 --> 00:08.509
So, whose laptop?

00:08.709 --> 00:09.644
Olivia Trelawney's.

00:09.844 --> 00:11.312
Do you know enough
about her personal life

00:11.512 --> 00:12.597
to help me crack that password?

00:12.797 --> 00:14.173
who does. I might know someone

00:14.373 --> 00:15.550
Clean out your locker, DeGeneres.

00:15.750 --> 00:19.087
We're parting ways.
Are you kidding me?

00:19.287 --> 00:20.155
Encryptions?

00:20.355 --> 00:22.590
We just have to figure out
another way in.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.326
Why do you think
it's okay to violate my privacy?

00:25.526 --> 00:27.345
Why do you have this mask?

00:27.545 --> 00:29.364
You told me you could change.

00:29.564 --> 00:31.566
I did. I certainly did.

00:31.766 --> 00:33.768
Don't you think I did?

00:35.236 --> 00:37.439
This is her third DUI!

00:37.639 --> 00:39.807
Jail isn't gonna just,
like, magically heal me.

00:40.007 --> 00:43.978
I'm not gonna go in and come out fixed.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.079
Can I ride home with you?

00:45.279 --> 00:46.180
Here, I'll grab the car.

<i>The wind turns like a dagger</i>

01:25.053 --> 01:28.256
<i>The rain falls like a hammer</i>

01:28.456 --> 01:31.459
<i>The sky has grown dark</i>

01:31.659 --> 01:34.629
<i>But it's not too late</i>

01:37.265 --> 01:39.701
<i>The weather crashes down</i>

01:41.169 --> 01:44.405
<i>What's lost cannot be found</i>

01:44.605 --> 01:47.642
<i>The night is closing</i>

01:47.842 --> 01:51.780
<i>But it's not too late</i>

01:51.980 --> 01:55.850
<i>It's not too late</i>

01:56.050 --> 01:58.319
<i>It's not too late</i>

02:00.588 --> 02:04.159
<i>The atmosphere is lethal</i>

02:04.359 --> 02:08.395
<i>But I will fear no evil</i>

02:36.824 --> 02:42.446
<i>Feelings are strange,
especially when they come true</i>

02:42.646 --> 02:47.610
<i>And I had a feeling
that you'd be leaving soon</i>

02:47.810 --> 02:52.774
<i>So I tried to rearrange
all my emotions</i>

02:54.709 --> 03:00.515
<i>But it seems the same
no matter what I do</i>

03:00.715 --> 03:06.321
<i>Blue umbrella, rest upon my shoulder</i>

03:06.521 --> 03:11.793
<i>And hide the pain while
the rain makes up my mind</i>

03:11.993 --> 03:15.980
<i>Well, my feet are wet from
thinking this thing over</i>

03:16.180 --> 03:19.968
At this point,
the police have ruled out nothing.

03:20.168 --> 03:22.887
"fuel explosion," "terrorism,"
We're "bomb," "accident,"

03:23.087 --> 03:25.807
but the most oft-repeated
phrase from law enforcement

03:26.007 --> 03:27.308
so far is,
"We just don't know."

03:27.508 --> 03:28.376
What we can tell you...

03:28.576 --> 03:30.344
this took place outside
Holy Nativity Church...

03:30.544 --> 03:31.212
Brady?!

03:31.412 --> 03:33.548
Come look at this! You're missing it.

03:33.748 --> 03:35.083
I'm busy.

03:36.150 --> 03:41.256
<i>Just give me one extra season</i>

03:41.456 --> 03:45.026
<i>So I can figure out the other four</i>

04:08.716 --> 04:11.152
There you are.

04:11.352 --> 04:14.021
You don't look so good.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.523
Rough day?

04:17.391 --> 04:18.959
I survived.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.528
That you did.

04:20.728 --> 04:24.098
Not everybody can say that, I guess.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.934
Sorry for the change of plans.

04:26.134 --> 04:29.804
It's unlike me to adlib,
but I got a sudden urge.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.343
Did you love her?

04:38.880 --> 04:40.948
I'll take that as a yes.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.554
Hello?

04:46.754 --> 04:48.556
Earth to Detective Hodges.

05:32.366 --> 05:35.269
I bet you're drinking now...

05:35.469 --> 05:37.805
medicating yourself.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.375
It will feel worse in the morning.

05:40.575 --> 05:43.778
On the bright side, though,
me and you, you and I...

05:43.978 --> 05:46.514
we now have, like, a theme.

05:46.714 --> 05:52.403
Big, big tragedies
just simply come down

05:52.603 --> 05:58.292
to "car access" in the end, it seems.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.694
You let her drive your car.

06:01.696 --> 06:03.698
And now she's dead.

06:03.898 --> 06:08.002
I know what's going on in your mind.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.303
That pressure...

06:11.439 --> 06:13.507
that noise.

06:18.212 --> 06:21.332
You can make it stop.

06:21.532 --> 06:24.452
Pick up the GLOCK.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.921
The one you keep on the table.

06:27.121 --> 06:28.256
Bill?

06:32.093 --> 06:33.061
Get out!

06:33.261 --> 06:33.928
Look, Bill...

06:34.128 --> 06:35.229
Get out of my fucking house!

06:35.429 --> 06:37.231
You shouldn't be alone
right now.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.400
Listen to me... Janey Patterson is dead

06:39.600 --> 06:40.902
because she got too close to me.

06:41.102 --> 06:42.670
Do you want to be next?
Please, Bill.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.405
Get out of my house, now!

06:44.605 --> 06:46.140
Please.
Fucking hell!

06:48.309 --> 06:49.944
You're scaring me now, Bill.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.746
I need your car.

06:51.946 --> 06:53.948
Your fucking car. I need your car.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.065
Brady!

07:47.201 --> 07:49.303
Supper's ready!

07:49.503 --> 07:51.605
I said I'm busy!

07:51.805 --> 07:53.941
Brady?!

07:54.141 --> 07:57.812
It's gonna get cold.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.550
Ooh.

08:45.459 --> 08:47.361
Oh, my God!

09:19.760 --> 09:21.829
Darkness.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.709
Mom?

09:34.909 --> 09:37.445
Mom! Mom!

09:37.645 --> 09:39.079
What... What... What...
What have you done?

09:39.279 --> 09:40.181
What... What happened? What...

09:40.381 --> 09:41.082
Braynie...

09:41.282 --> 09:43.334
What's happened...
What have you done?

09:43.534 --> 09:45.586
Why have you bitten through your mouth?

09:45.786 --> 09:46.387
What's happened?!

09:46.587 --> 09:47.922
Wait! What the fuck? No.

09:55.162 --> 09:59.934
Caw...nie... waa...whan!

10:00.134 --> 10:01.302
W-When did you eat this, Mom?!

10:01.502 --> 10:03.304
When did you fucking eat this?!

10:03.504 --> 10:05.306
Fuck!
Caw nie...waa...whan!

10:05.506 --> 10:07.241
911. 9...

10:07.441 --> 10:09.593
911.

10:09.793 --> 10:11.946
Braynie!

10:18.719 --> 10:21.438
Bray...

10:21.638 --> 10:24.358
Hel...me.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.915
You need to drink water, Mom.

10:32.115 --> 10:33.901
You've ingested poison, okay?

10:34.969 --> 10:37.104
You've, uh...

10:39.073 --> 10:39.840
Drink it!

10:42.109 --> 10:44.979
No. Fuck! Salt!

10:45.179 --> 10:47.314
You're gonna have to throw up, okay?

10:47.514 --> 10:49.650
Just... We don't them them, Mom.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.352
Okay, salt.

10:51.552 --> 10:53.787
Salt, okay, to make you throw up.

10:55.589 --> 10:57.892
Mom!

10:58.092 --> 10:59.193
Throw it up.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.299
Yes, mom. That's good.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.133
That's good.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.268
Mom...

11:08.468 --> 11:10.404
Mom!

11:12.940 --> 11:15.476
Throw it up. Throw it up.

11:20.414 --> 11:22.683
Mom, mom! Mom, mom, mom?

11:22.883 --> 11:24.752
Mom, mom?

11:58.319 --> 12:03.557
<i>Heigh-ho, nobody knows</i>

12:03.757 --> 12:08.762

12:08.962 --> 12:13.817

12:31.852 --> 12:34.822
<i>Heigh-ho</i>

12:35.022 --> 12:38.192
Sorry, sorry.

13:09.390 --> 13:14.228
<i>Heigh-ho, nobody knows</i>

13:14.428 --> 13:19.500
<i>Love nor hope nor honor have I none</i>

13:19.700 --> 13:24.438

<i>Narcissistic needs entirely unmet</i>

13:54.902 --> 13:56.770
<i>Narcissistic needs</i>

14:00.040 --> 14:05.546

14:25.933 --> 14:30.604
<i>Heigh-ho, nobody knows</i>

15:02.503 --> 15:04.638
What are you doing?

15:04.838 --> 15:06.640
Pack your things.
We're going home.

15:06.840 --> 15:07.608
Wait. Now?

15:07.808 --> 15:09.126
Well, there's no reason to wait.

15:09.326 --> 15:10.644
They won't release Janey's remains

15:10.844 --> 15:11.879
for at least a week.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.213
They have to do a full autopsy first.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.348
No, but we have to wait.

15:14.548 --> 15:16.283
Art will be coming back here alone

15:16.483 --> 15:17.151
when they've finished.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.719
But what about the DNA samples?

15:18.919 --> 15:20.454
We'll drop those off at the precinct.

15:20.654 --> 15:22.739
Dr. Klein has already faxed
over Janey's dental records.

15:22.939 --> 15:25.025
They should be able to make
a positive identification.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.362
No, I don't think
we should leave the body. I...

15:28.562 --> 15:29.430
Well, we are.

15:29.630 --> 15:31.398
But what about Mr. Hodges?

15:31.598 --> 15:33.200
I mean,
we have to make sure that he's okay.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.470
"Mr. Hodges"?

15:36.670 --> 15:38.305
I don't give a damn
about "Mr. Hodges."

15:38.505 --> 15:40.107
He helped wipe out half of this family!

15:40.307 --> 15:41.909
Charlotte...
She needs to hear this.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.477
I want to stay.
Well, you're not.

15:43.677 --> 15:45.012
Yes, I am.

15:45.212 --> 15:48.532
Okay, I'm 311/2 years old.
I can make decisions.

15:48.732 --> 15:52.052
Holly, you are going home...
end of discussion!

15:52.252 --> 15:54.822
Hollybug, did you take your Lexapro?

16:01.161 --> 16:01.762
Hollybug, come on out.

16:32.893 --> 16:34.594
Yeah, I need to see Allie Shannon,
please.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.496
Like I told you,
these aren't visiting hours,

16:36.696 --> 16:37.631
It's an emergency.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.499
I'm sorry.
I can't let you see her right now.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.802
It's an emergency!

16:42.002 --> 16:44.304
Visiting days are Saturdays and Sundays,
from 11:00 to 3:00.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.206
You're more than welcome
to come during those times.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.908
I said it's an "emergency."

16:48.108 --> 16:50.744
I understand, but we have our rules.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.445
Yeah. Where is she?

16:52.645 --> 16:53.947
Hey, everything okay?

16:54.147 --> 16:55.682
He wants to see his daughter.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.217
Sir...
Fuck off, please.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.552
We have certain protocols in place.

16:58.752 --> 17:00.237
I was a cop for 35 years,

17:00.437 --> 17:01.722
I know all about protocol,

17:01.922 --> 17:04.124
and there's a time
to dump it in the shitter.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.492
This is one of those times.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.063
And he didn't say where he was going?

17:09.262 --> 17:12.366
He did not.
He just said it was an emergency.

17:12.566 --> 17:13.967
Would you call him?

17:14.166 --> 17:16.703
We've tried, but, uh,
he won't pick up for me.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.372
And this is a very serious situation.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.207
Gee.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.175
You think?

17:22.376 --> 17:24.310
Your call has been forwarded...

17:24.511 --> 17:26.313
Straight to voicemail.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.115
Here's my personal number.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.850
If you hear from him,
would you contact me right away?

17:30.050 --> 17:30.584
Mm-hmm.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.993
Am I in danger?

17:40.193 --> 17:42.295
I hope not.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.598
But...could be.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.468
But you're in danger.

17:48.668 --> 17:49.937
Likely, yeah.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.141
Okay.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.952
You look like shit.

18:08.422 --> 18:11.291
When exactly do you
get out of this place?

18:11.491 --> 18:16.130
Next month, if I'm ready.

18:16.330 --> 18:18.849
Okay, well,
you need to tell me if that changes.

18:19.049 --> 18:21.568
And meanwhile,
I'll see about adding security here.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.440
Are you serious?

18:26.640 --> 18:27.708
This individual is very active.

18:30.077 --> 18:30.577
Okay...

18:35.082 --> 18:36.383
What about Mom? Have you spoken to Mom?

18:38.919 --> 18:40.320
Wouldn't she be in danger, too?

18:40.520 --> 18:41.388
If you called her...

18:41.588 --> 18:43.123
I really don't believe so.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.858
I really don't.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.333
I haven't seen you in years,

18:53.533 --> 18:55.235
and you come here...

18:55.435 --> 18:56.870
you come here out of nowhere,

18:57.070 --> 19:00.674
and you just drop this
steaming pile of shit on my lap.

19:00.874 --> 19:03.276
I don't know what I'm supposed...

19:03.476 --> 19:04.411
I don't...

19:04.611 --> 19:07.948
You'll be okay here.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.617
But you cannot leave
without my say so, okay?

19:13.220 --> 19:14.287
Okay.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.409
I do call, y'know.

19:19.609 --> 19:21.495
You never pick up.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.570
I leave you messages.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.573
Do they...

19:32.773 --> 19:34.841
Do they give you my messages?

19:42.749 --> 19:44.317
I need to go back to my room.

19:56.129 --> 19:59.532
the blast, which killed one
and wounded a dozen others,

19:59.732 --> 20:02.485
sent shockwaves through the
usually quiet downtown area.

20:02.685 --> 20:05.439
Authorities have confirmed
that the vehicle was registered

20:05.639 --> 20:06.506
to William Hodges,

20:06.706 --> 20:09.276
a retired Bridgton homicide detective,

20:09.476 --> 20:12.712
but refused to speculate
as to any motive for the crime.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.681
This shocking footage was captured...

20:14.881 --> 20:17.050
Honey, let's go.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.902
while attending the funeral.

20:19.102 --> 20:20.754
Luckily, she was unharmed.

20:20.954 --> 20:21.955
What are you doing?

20:22.155 --> 20:23.723
You're scaring off
the customers.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.408
Sorry.
You okay?

20:25.608 --> 20:26.894
You don't look good.

20:27.094 --> 20:29.229
Yeah. I installed a mainframe

20:29.429 --> 20:31.598
in Jackson Realty last month,
right on that block.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.233
It's hard to believe it's real.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.536
In here, it's not real.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.238
It isn't?
No.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.707
Mayhem, terror, flying body parts...

20:40.907 --> 20:41.775
that's all out there.

20:41.975 --> 20:44.478
That's not what
we're selling at Supreme.

20:44.678 --> 20:47.381
In here, we sell escape,

20:47.581 --> 20:50.650
the dream of better living
through technology.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.052
We sell the future.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.453
Here?

20:53.653 --> 20:56.306
The toilet doesn't even flush.

20:56.506 --> 20:59.159
Well, that's about to change.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.527
Big time.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.029
Tell him, Robi.

21:02.229 --> 21:04.481
Corporate wants to make this
a Superstore.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.733
You know what a Superstore is?
Yeah, a big...

21:06.933 --> 21:10.137
One that uses the Malcolm X
theory of customer relations...

21:10.337 --> 21:11.204
you get them inside,

21:11.404 --> 21:14.941
and you keep them there
by any means necessary.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.743
Eventually, they will buy something.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.912
We're talking about listening booths,
demo stations,

21:19.112 --> 21:20.781
maybe even a little coffee kiosk.

21:20.981 --> 21:22.649
Very cool.
Let them hang out all day.

21:22.849 --> 21:25.952
Research suggests that when
a city has a resurgence,

21:26.152 --> 21:27.888
then young families. artists come first,

21:28.088 --> 21:30.023
We have to make this a destination,

21:30.223 --> 21:32.626
a fundamental and meaningful
part of their everyday lives.

21:32.826 --> 21:35.629
Like Starbucks. Or Chuck E. Cheese.

21:35.829 --> 21:37.264
Why are you here?

21:37.464 --> 21:41.268
Well, I'm trying to go hetero.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.436
In the interests
of securing employment,

21:43.636 --> 21:45.788
either back here or elsewhere.

21:45.988 --> 21:47.698
My, uh, conversion therapist,

21:47.898 --> 21:49.409
she's telling me I need to fixate

21:49.609 --> 21:54.814
on male fantasy figures
to occasion sexual desire,

21:55.014 --> 21:56.449
so I've come to gape at you.

21:58.518 --> 21:59.820
Nothing yet.

22:00.020 --> 22:02.289
You fucking sued me.

22:02.489 --> 22:03.790
Just trying to stay connected, Robi.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.092
I'm calling security.

22:05.292 --> 22:07.377
Oh, yeah, those guys... Team Goon.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.663
Actually, I'm just here to see Brady.

22:09.863 --> 22:10.664
Brady, can I see you outside?

22:19.506 --> 22:21.875
Hey. You kinda
freaked me out last night.

22:22.075 --> 22:23.343
Sorry.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.295
Are you all right?

22:25.495 --> 22:27.047
Yeah, fine.
"Fine?"

22:27.247 --> 22:30.417
Yeah, 'cause that voicemail
you left me last night

22:30.617 --> 22:33.586
really sounded anything but fine.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.756
Actually, it was, like, a little...

22:36.956 --> 22:38.291
breathy, hysterical.

22:38.491 --> 22:41.494
And then you don't pick up
when I call back?

22:41.694 --> 22:43.597
My mom got sick.

22:43.797 --> 22:48.335
She thought she was having
a heart attack or something,

22:48.535 --> 22:50.403
refused to let me take her
to the hospital.

22:50.603 --> 22:51.905
Freaked me out.
Is she okay?

22:52.105 --> 22:53.540
Yeah.

22:53.740 --> 22:58.445
It was just, uh, angina or gas,

22:58.645 --> 22:59.896
maybe both.

23:00.096 --> 23:01.148
Are you okay?

23:01.348 --> 23:04.718
'Cause you look like
you're still a little,

23:04.918 --> 23:06.520
I don't know, freaked out.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.188
Oh, I just didn't sleep much last night.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.465
So you're really suing them?

23:18.665 --> 23:22.536
That's impressive.

23:22.736 --> 23:27.173
Brady, are you all right?

23:27.373 --> 23:30.010
Yeah.

23:30.210 --> 23:31.478
Good to see you.

23:41.688 --> 23:45.225
First off, how you doing?

23:45.425 --> 23:49.229
Been better.

23:49.429 --> 23:55.168
And as for where you've been
the last 12 hours...

23:55.368 --> 23:58.471
I had to make sure my daughter was safe.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.774
Gonna need help with that.

24:00.974 --> 24:06.479
I need a body posted at her facility.

24:06.679 --> 24:07.914
Maybe your house, too.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.049
Not necessary.

24:09.249 --> 24:12.519
He knows my house,
he knows I have cameras.

24:12.719 --> 24:15.789
He'll be steering
clear of my house.

24:15.989 --> 24:19.326
Hey, you, uh...
you get yourself checked out?

24:19.526 --> 24:20.994
Have you seen a doctor?

24:21.194 --> 24:25.398
I'm fine.
Yeah, physically, maybe.

24:25.598 --> 24:26.799
Mentally, Bill...

24:26.999 --> 24:29.069
Yeah,
my mental health is not your concern.

24:32.605 --> 24:35.709
Shit, Bill, I'm sorry.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.877
You know, I know how hard
you tried to tell us before.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.280
And, uh...

24:40.480 --> 24:42.282
I'm sorry. Truly.

24:50.123 --> 24:51.091
You need to tell us again.

24:53.827 --> 24:55.895
You need to tell us everything.

24:59.132 --> 25:00.300
Let's start with Janelle Patterson

25:00.500 --> 25:03.637
and work our way back.

25:03.837 --> 25:07.323
How did you know the deceased?

25:07.523 --> 25:11.010
How did she wind up in your car?

25:11.210 --> 25:12.779
Okay.

25:18.485 --> 25:21.171
<i>Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
can I go out and play?</i>

25:21.371 --> 25:23.364
<i>No, son, you better stay inside</i>

25:23.564 --> 25:25.358
<i>The radio said today...</i>

25:25.558 --> 25:26.793
<i>Let's go into the basement</i>

25:26.993 --> 25:28.562
<i>Lock the door, and start to pray</i>

25:28.762 --> 25:33.433
Hey, Brady. <i>Get your lead umbrella...</i>

25:33.633 --> 25:34.534
What's going on?

25:34.734 --> 25:37.337
FedEx tried to deliver
this today, and nobody answered.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.472
I saw them,
figured it might be important,

25:39.672 --> 25:41.007
so I signed for it.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.543
What are you,
fucking "neighborhood watch" now?

25:43.743 --> 25:46.779
What?
I'm just kidding.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.816
Yeah, hey, uh, look, I...

25:50.016 --> 25:51.618
I was s'posed to have lunch
with your mom today,

25:51.818 --> 25:57.190
but sh-she never showed.

25:57.390 --> 25:58.291
Everything okay?

25:58.491 --> 26:03.363
I didn't realize you two were dating.

26:03.563 --> 26:06.799
Nobody's dating anybody, man.

26:06.999 --> 26:10.236
Actually, she had to leave town.

26:10.436 --> 26:11.971
Really? Where to?

26:12.171 --> 26:13.373
Indiana.

26:13.573 --> 26:14.908
Indiana?
Mm-hmm.

26:15.108 --> 26:16.376
Her best friend from high school,

26:16.576 --> 26:17.994
she's opened a salon in Gary.

26:18.194 --> 26:19.821
Wants my mom to run it with her.

26:20.021 --> 26:21.648
It's kind of an old
dream they had.

26:21.848 --> 26:23.450
Hmm.

26:23.650 --> 26:26.319
Well, you know, good for her, right?

26:26.519 --> 26:28.188
Right. Onward and upward.

26:28.388 --> 26:30.290
Thanks for the, uh...
Yeah, sure, anytime.

26:30.490 --> 26:31.725
Appreciate it.

26:31.925 --> 26:34.928
Oh, when she calls,
I'll let her know you came by.

26:35.128 --> 26:36.996
Okay?

27:16.069 --> 27:18.471
What are you doing in that car?

27:18.671 --> 27:20.874
I...
Ollie left it in the garage,

27:21.074 --> 27:22.775
and I had to purchase a new toothbrush,

27:22.975 --> 27:25.178
and also see that you're okay.

27:25.378 --> 27:26.379
I could've shot you.

27:26.579 --> 27:28.815
You're not answering my calls.

27:29.015 --> 27:30.984
I'm not contractually obligated
to answer your calls, Holly.

27:31.184 --> 27:33.053
Bill?

27:33.253 --> 27:34.654
Is everything all right?

27:47.467 --> 27:49.852
You shouldn't be driving that car.

27:50.052 --> 27:52.238
It might've been tampered with.

27:52.438 --> 27:55.475
Well, where did you go?
I mean, Jerome was worried, too.

28:03.950 --> 28:06.152
Hello?
This is Charlotte Gibney.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.555
Holly's been missing for hours and we...

28:08.755 --> 28:10.456
She's here. She's safe.

28:10.656 --> 28:11.741
She's with you?

28:11.941 --> 28:12.826
Yeah, she's fine.

28:13.026 --> 28:15.562
Oh, no worries at all then.

28:15.762 --> 28:17.981
You just helped kill my sister,

28:18.181 --> 28:20.058
my niece was just blown to bits...

28:20.258 --> 28:21.847
and I should just sit back and chill

28:22.047 --> 28:23.636
because Holly's in your good hands.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.706
Your mother.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.551
Hello?
Holly...

28:38.751 --> 28:40.753
if you're not back here
within half an hour,

28:40.953 --> 28:42.088
I will have you physically removed.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.390
Do you understand?

28:43.590 --> 28:46.593
Um, I think I'm gonna stay here
with Bill for a while longer.

28:46.793 --> 28:47.126
With "Bill"?

28:50.430 --> 28:51.664
Janey's cousin.

28:51.864 --> 28:54.400
She's odd, but she's all right.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.435
I can see that.

28:56.635 --> 28:58.471
How are you?

29:00.506 --> 29:02.208
What're you gonna do, right?

29:02.408 --> 29:04.010
What is that,

29:04.210 --> 29:06.312
the Everything's Fucking Pointless Motto

29:06.512 --> 29:09.416
of the Irish Male?

29:09.616 --> 29:11.317
"You've got cancer, Mr. Hodges."

29:11.517 --> 29:13.253
"Well, what are you gonna do, right?"

29:13.453 --> 29:16.689
"Your family burned up
in a fire, Mr. Hodges."

29:16.889 --> 29:18.691
"What are you gonna do, right?"

29:18.891 --> 29:21.294
I asked how you are.

29:21.494 --> 29:23.596
How do you expect me to be?

29:23.796 --> 29:27.567
Accelerating your plan
to drink yourself to death.

29:27.767 --> 29:28.234
Maybe after I kill him.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.306
I'm 311/2 years old,

29:33.506 --> 29:35.441
and I don't have to listen to you!

29:36.643 --> 29:38.845
And I will leave you to it.

29:40.747 --> 29:43.399
You don't want to stick around?

29:43.599 --> 29:46.252
I've been confused with a saint,

29:46.452 --> 29:47.253
but never a martyr.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.019
Holly.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.138
Yeah?

30:12.011 --> 30:15.882
Just... they calm my nerves.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.517
How many do you take?

30:17.717 --> 30:20.753
Uh, Dr. Rajan said
no more than three per day.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.155
Well, that looked
like at least three.

30:39.472 --> 30:40.440
Do you have a plan?

30:40.640 --> 30:41.774
A plan?

30:43.776 --> 30:45.545
To find him.

30:45.745 --> 30:47.263
To get him. We need to get him.

30:47.463 --> 30:48.781
My plan is to call you a cab

30:48.981 --> 30:50.716
as soon as you're feeling better.

30:50.916 --> 30:52.452
I will direct that cab to a motel,

30:52.652 --> 30:54.253
'cause I am not going home
to my mother tonight.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.863
You know, I've never checked
into a motel by myself.

31:09.569 --> 31:11.120
I think I'm gonna call your mother.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.872
I will not take kindly to that, okay?

31:13.072 --> 31:14.006
I'm a grown-up.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.141
Yes, you are.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.219
Maggie and Frank

31:26.419 --> 31:28.321
were at each other's throats
from the start.

31:28.521 --> 31:30.323
They must learn to work with each other

31:30.523 --> 31:31.391
if they are to make it

31:31.591 --> 31:33.459
through this portion of the competition.

31:33.659 --> 31:37.530
Only by...

31:57.383 --> 31:59.886
it appears Maggie and Frank

32:00.086 --> 32:02.321
are the leaders of this portion
of the competition.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.059
This is Allie's room.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.262
She had a turtle?

32:26.462 --> 32:29.015
Hmm.
A tortoise.

32:29.215 --> 32:31.517
My mother would never
allow me to have a pet.

32:31.717 --> 32:35.588
She said that a cat would agitate me,
a dog could bite,

32:35.788 --> 32:39.459
and any other kind of pet
was an affectation, so...

32:39.659 --> 32:46.499
She also said that, knowing me,
I'd probably be allergic.

32:46.699 --> 32:49.569
What's this?

32:49.769 --> 32:52.038
She thought it looked like me.

32:52.238 --> 32:53.506
It doesn't. But she thought it did.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.631
You gonna be okay?

33:02.831 --> 33:04.274
Yeah, I think so.

33:04.474 --> 33:05.918
Yeah, I'm fine.

33:10.156 --> 33:11.824
Mm. Oh.

33:12.024 --> 33:14.527
There's a whole entire sky up here

33:14.727 --> 33:16.529
filled with cumulous clouds.

33:16.729 --> 33:18.264
She loved the constellations
when she was little.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.337
So one day I put up this.

33:28.407 --> 33:29.342
You gave her the universe.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.883
They're just stickers.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.150
And what are we?

33:40.686 --> 33:46.259
Less than fucking that.

33:46.459 --> 33:48.194
I'm sorry.

33:48.394 --> 33:49.962
Do you really think
there's no time in heaven,

33:50.162 --> 33:52.031
like Janey said?

33:56.903 --> 34:02.175
I hope.

34:02.375 --> 34:05.344
We're with her, and she's with us?

34:05.544 --> 34:08.514
Maybe we're all at Willow Lake?

34:08.714 --> 34:11.617
Maybe. Good night.

34:11.817 --> 34:15.922
Good night.

35:41.273 --> 35:44.610
No.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.947
Um...

35:49.682 --> 35:53.052
What if I try...

35:53.252 --> 35:54.220
No.

35:57.423 --> 35:59.558
No, that's perfect.

35:59.758 --> 36:00.860
Uh...

36:01.060 --> 36:03.429
Try the other one.

36:03.629 --> 36:05.831
Um...

36:06.031 --> 36:08.234
Yeah.

36:10.102 --> 36:14.340
Maybe...

36:14.540 --> 36:16.342
No, we tried that.
Yeah, that's good.

36:16.542 --> 36:17.877
Well, that'd be good.

36:18.077 --> 36:19.212
Maybe. Let me see.

36:19.412 --> 36:21.914
I tried.
What the fuck?

36:24.483 --> 36:26.385
Well, good morning to you, too.

36:26.585 --> 36:27.653
We have coffee.

36:27.853 --> 36:30.022
Ollie's password... I cracked it.

36:30.222 --> 36:32.391
it's... it's... it's willowlake...

36:34.326 --> 36:38.531
90362. All lower case, one word.

36:38.731 --> 36:41.867
But, um, now, I just need Jerome
to help me with something, so...

36:42.067 --> 36:43.135
It'll be quick, all right?
Yeah.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.238
You shouldn't be here.

36:45.438 --> 36:49.141
Yeah, I know.
Okay, so try Audio File.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.744
Uh, you know,
it just has to do with output and input.

36:51.944 --> 36:53.079
Well, try it anyway.
Okay.

36:53.279 --> 36:55.014
Okay, so go to Sound Effects.
Over there on the left side.

36:56.949 --> 36:58.217
Okay.

36:59.285 --> 37:00.920
"Spooks."

37:01.120 --> 37:02.521
I've never heard that before.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.423
Yeah, me, neither. And I-I know Mac.

37:05.758 --> 37:07.560
Oh.

37:07.760 --> 37:09.762
Why did you let him murder my baby?!

37:09.962 --> 37:12.631
Fuck!

37:14.567 --> 37:16.368
Why did you let him
murder my baby?

37:16.568 --> 37:18.370
Did you know that was going to happen?

37:18.570 --> 37:19.405
Hell no. Uh...

37:19.605 --> 37:20.172
Oh.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.178
Ollie did hear them.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.546
I knew she was telling the truth.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.583
See if you can find out
anything about the program,

37:30.783 --> 37:32.284
how it was loaded, when?

37:32.484 --> 37:34.386
Okay. Push over.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.455
Okay.

37:41.127 --> 37:42.928
Okay.
Yeah, it looks like it was installed

37:43.128 --> 37:45.264
on July first of last year.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.433
Yeah, a whole bunch of stuff
was installed that day.

37:47.633 --> 37:48.534
So, you think maybe it was programmed

37:48.734 --> 37:50.036
to play at a certain time?

37:50.236 --> 37:51.804
Cycle three times over, and then quit?

37:52.004 --> 37:54.273
Yeah, it's a slave program,
hidden in her Mail Contacts.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.175
It's called, uh, Inner Demon.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.977
So you can't use it
to turn on a computer...

37:58.177 --> 38:00.262
at least I don't think so...
but once a computer is on,

38:00.462 --> 38:02.548
you can run everything remotely
from your own computer...

38:02.748 --> 38:04.183
you can open files,

38:04.383 --> 38:05.584
you can look at search histories...

38:05.784 --> 38:07.853
or deactivate programs or...

38:08.053 --> 38:10.973
So somebody would have had
to manually load this computer?

38:11.173 --> 38:13.734
I mean, actually have their
fingers on the keyboard, right?

38:13.934 --> 38:16.495
At first. But then you can
control everything remotely,

38:16.695 --> 38:18.097
from wherever you are.

38:18.297 --> 38:19.899
So, all we have to do is just figure out

38:20.099 --> 38:22.601
who had access to your cousin's
house and laptop.

38:22.801 --> 38:23.903
And then we could
just narrow it from there.

38:24.103 --> 38:24.870
Right.

38:25.070 --> 38:27.540
Yeah, I mean,
we can get this guy with this.

38:27.740 --> 38:28.974
Wait, wait, wait, wait. All right, wait.

38:29.174 --> 38:30.910
Just pack it up.

38:31.110 --> 38:31.844
What?
This goes to the police.

38:32.044 --> 38:34.547
Why?

38:34.747 --> 38:35.781
Wait, Hodges, the police?

38:35.981 --> 38:37.083
Really?
Yes.

38:37.283 --> 38:38.517
Since it's their game now.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.586
Be careful.

38:41.820 --> 38:45.424
Come on. Come on.
Jesus fucking Christ.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.259
What are you doing?

38:50.362 --> 38:52.231
What do you mean,
"What am I doing?" I'm sick.

38:52.431 --> 38:54.066
Oh, fuck. Are you kidding me?

38:54.266 --> 38:55.735
You choose now of all times to be sick?

38:55.935 --> 38:58.037
As we get ready
for the gala, the expansion?

38:58.237 --> 38:59.371
I've been calling you for the last hour.

38:59.571 --> 39:01.473
Why haven't you picked up?

39:01.673 --> 39:02.675
Because I'm sick!

39:02.875 --> 39:05.077
Let me tell you something...
part of being a leader,

39:05.277 --> 39:07.446
which a store manager
first and foremost is,

39:07.646 --> 39:08.747
is playing through the pain.

39:08.947 --> 39:09.849
We don't have the luxury

39:10.049 --> 39:11.484
of being sick, we plow through it.

39:11.684 --> 39:15.154
We are undermanned as it is,
I need you to play through it.

39:15.354 --> 39:16.455
Well,
maybe you should have thought about that

39:16.655 --> 39:17.690
before you started firing people.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.929
Oh, is that what this is?

39:24.129 --> 39:25.631
A little blue flu on behalf
of your dyke friend?

39:32.304 --> 39:33.038
What the fuck is wrong with you?

39:36.008 --> 39:40.412
I told you. I'm under the weather.

39:40.612 --> 39:42.514
And I need my rest.

39:45.584 --> 39:46.919
You know what you are, Brady?

39:49.288 --> 39:51.790
You're "not working out."

39:51.990 --> 39:59.865
That's what you are.

40:02.301 --> 40:05.938
Why did you let him murder my baby?

40:10.476 --> 40:16.181
Why did you let him murder my baby?

40:16.381 --> 40:18.567
Holy fuck.

40:18.767 --> 40:20.911
Exactly.

40:21.111 --> 40:23.055
Why did...

40:23.255 --> 40:25.424
It cycles three times.
Do you want me to turn it off?

40:25.624 --> 40:27.059
Yes, please.
Okay.

40:27.259 --> 40:29.428
And he came at you, too?
Through the laptop?

40:29.628 --> 40:31.964
And through the television.

40:32.164 --> 40:34.300
And, according to Holly,

40:34.500 --> 40:37.403
these programs have to be
installed by hand, on site.

40:37.603 --> 40:38.437
Is that right?

40:38.637 --> 40:40.606
Yeah.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.908
So he's tech savvy,
and had to have access

40:43.108 --> 40:45.210
to both houses,
yours and Olivia Trelawney's.

40:45.410 --> 40:45.711
What do you have in common?

40:46.578 --> 40:49.048
With Olivia Trelawney?

40:49.248 --> 40:50.282
This case.

40:50.482 --> 40:53.252
Same plumber, exterminator, housekeeper?
Cable guy?

40:53.452 --> 40:54.754
None of that.

40:54.954 --> 40:58.691
Did, um,
your cousin have a lot of visitors?

40:58.891 --> 41:00.459
Um, we didn't talk much about that.

41:00.659 --> 41:03.061
Mostly,
we just played a game online at night.

41:03.261 --> 41:05.464
It's basically just like Boggle,
but digital.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.366
Any idea where she would
have bought her computer,

41:07.566 --> 41:09.268
or who serviced it?
What do you call those guys?

41:11.070 --> 41:12.605
Oh, her Geek Freak?

41:12.805 --> 41:14.340
That's it. Any idea?

41:14.540 --> 41:15.474
Hmm...

41:15.674 --> 41:16.942
Maybe she kept her records online?

41:17.142 --> 41:19.611
Well, I can check.
No, no. This is evidence now.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.213
We'll take it from here.

41:21.413 --> 41:22.247
Is that...?

41:22.447 --> 41:23.282
It's all right.

41:23.482 --> 41:24.550
Let's go.

41:36.662 --> 41:39.365
There's something
we should probably discuss.

41:39.565 --> 41:41.200
It's not likely to please you.

41:41.400 --> 41:42.434
What?

41:49.341 --> 41:50.576
What is this?

41:50.776 --> 41:52.578
It's not safe for you to stay with me.

41:54.580 --> 41:57.116
I'm not going with them.

42:06.091 --> 42:08.010
I can't let you risk your life.

42:08.210 --> 42:10.220
Well, I'm not going with them.

42:10.420 --> 42:12.431
Holly...
You betrayed me!

42:12.631 --> 42:15.601
Think of it from my side.

42:15.801 --> 42:18.571
Think you can do that?

42:18.771 --> 42:20.873
The idea of you...
The idea of me what?

42:23.876 --> 42:25.444
I've lost too much.

42:25.644 --> 42:26.812
I can't...

42:27.012 --> 42:30.966
It's unreasonable. I can't.

42:31.166 --> 42:34.920
I'm not a reasonable person.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.256
I'm also not an altogether well person.

42:37.456 --> 42:39.625
But I will never be well,
I will never be anything

42:39.825 --> 42:41.093
if I have to go home with her.

42:43.328 --> 42:45.230
She's your mum.
It has to count for something.

42:45.430 --> 42:46.498
And she's family.

42:48.500 --> 42:49.902
Out you go.

42:58.510 --> 42:59.111
Fuck me up the arse.

43:18.063 --> 43:22.367
I know you mean well.
I'll get her things.

43:42.221 --> 43:45.224
Thank you.

43:45.424 --> 43:48.460
I'm sorry for your...

43:48.660 --> 43:51.697
y-your... your loss...

43:54.032 --> 43:56.101
Yes.

44:15.754 --> 44:18.457
bustling with excitement

44:18.657 --> 44:20.826
of the new arts center for the opening

44:21.026 --> 44:23.195
after years of planning and preparation.

44:25.397 --> 44:27.733
begins with a formal ribbon cutting,

44:27.933 --> 44:29.101
followed by a reception gala

44:29.301 --> 44:31.336
for people from all walks of life

44:31.536 --> 44:32.538
to enjoy and appreciate.

44:32.738 --> 44:34.707
massive crowds They are anticipating

44:34.907 --> 44:37.442
for this opening
here in downtown Bridgton,

44:37.642 --> 44:39.378
so please make sure you plan ahead,

44:39.578 --> 44:42.447
and don't miss the opening
of this new arts center.

44:42.647 --> 44:43.782
That's gonna do it for now.

44:43.982 --> 44:46.351
Let's send it back to you in the studio.

44:46.551 --> 44:47.386
Thanks, John.

44:47.586 --> 44:49.821
Looking forward
to your coverage tomorrow

44:50.021 --> 44:52.257
live from the Edmund Mills Arts Center.

44:52.457 --> 44:53.359
All in all, it promises

44:53.559 --> 44:55.728
to be a new beginning
for so many people,

44:55.928 --> 44:59.431
embracing not just the arts
but the future of Bridgton,

44:59.631 --> 45:01.633
maybe even hope itself.

45:01.833 --> 45:04.369
Thousands of residents,
visitors, spectators,

45:04.569 --> 45:06.271
and participants will be on hand

45:06.471 --> 45:09.641
for what's expected to be
a celebration of tomorrow

45:09.841 --> 45:11.276
for so many.

45:11.476 --> 45:15.914
Oh, there will be
a celebration tomorrow.

45:16.114 --> 45:17.983
Absolutely.

45:31.396 --> 45:33.198
Did you love her?

45:33.398 --> 45:36.101
Janey?

45:36.301 --> 45:37.803
I barely knew her.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.141
Maybe I just loved
the idea of loving her.

45:47.546 --> 45:49.481
Being in love a little bit.

45:49.681 --> 45:51.617
Allowing for the possibilities.

45:51.817 --> 45:53.485
Then there's hope for you.

45:53.685 --> 45:55.287
No, there isn't.

45:55.487 --> 45:57.089
I'm dead.

45:57.289 --> 46:00.025
You are not dead.

46:00.225 --> 46:03.162
I am.

46:03.362 --> 46:06.331
And now, he needs to be.

46:06.531 --> 46:10.169
<i>This little light of mine</i>

46:10.369 --> 46:14.239
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

46:14.439 --> 46:19.444
<i>This little light of mine,
I'm gonna let it shine</i>

46:21.813 --> 46:27.185
<i>This little light of mine,
I'm gonna let it shine</i>

46:27.385 --> 46:29.822
<i>Let it shine</i>

46:30.022 --> 46:32.825
<i>Let it shine</i>

46:33.025 --> 46:35.594
<i>Let it shine</i>

46:41.466 --> 46:43.535
I have a secret.

46:46.872 --> 46:50.892
I had a girl once.

46:51.092 --> 46:54.913
Shh. Don't get upset.

46:55.113 --> 46:58.684
I never told you because I knew
you wouldn't be okay with it.

47:02.554 --> 47:04.156
You wouldn't have.

47:09.761 --> 47:12.497
It was Sandy Frechette.

47:12.697 --> 47:15.083
Science Club.

47:15.283 --> 47:17.469
Remember her?

47:17.669 --> 47:24.109
You said she had kind eyes.

47:24.309 --> 47:27.379
I wanted another life for a minute.

47:27.579 --> 47:30.382
You know?

47:30.582 --> 47:33.185
Another one.

47:33.385 --> 47:36.655
But I don't want that anymore.

47:36.855 --> 47:42.394
I just want this one
for a tiny bit longer.

47:44.763 --> 47:47.933
I'm gonna make you proud, Mom.

47:48.133 --> 47:50.101
A masterpiece...

47:50.301 --> 47:52.270
for all the ages.

47:54.439 --> 47:58.210
And then we'll see each other the way

47:58.410 --> 48:02.347
you said we always would.

48:02.547 --> 48:04.416
Or...

48:16.728 --> 48:19.531
<i>This little light of mine</i>

48:19.731 --> 48:22.601
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

48:22.801 --> 48:26.071
<i>This little light of mine</i>

48:26.271 --> 48:29.641
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

48:29.841 --> 48:32.878
<i>This little light of mine</i>

48:33.078 --> 48:35.647
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

48:35.847 --> 48:39.384
<i>This little light of mine</i>

48:39.584 --> 48:42.487
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

48:42.687 --> 48:45.390
