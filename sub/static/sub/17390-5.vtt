WEBVTT

00:03.554 --> 00:06.681
Picked another winner,
gang. Huh? Look at this guy.

00:06.705 --> 00:08.572
I named him Jerome,
'cause he's got thighs

00:08.574 --> 00:11.041
like Jerome Bettis.

00:11.043 --> 00:13.454
You ever seen a
Thanksgiving bird like this?

00:13.479 --> 00:16.146
Yeah. We saw that exact
one at the turkey farm.

00:16.148 --> 00:18.816
Except he had feathers and
his head was still attached.

00:18.818 --> 00:20.951
Please, tell me you didn't actually

00:20.953 --> 00:22.653
let them see the turkeys get killed.

00:22.655 --> 00:26.147
- Well... They got to pet them first.
- Oh, my God...

00:26.172 --> 00:29.631
Wait, that's not the
same turkey I fed, is it?

00:29.656 --> 00:30.988
No!

00:31.100 --> 00:33.067
No. No, no, no.

00:33.132 --> 00:35.766
They set that one free.

00:35.768 --> 00:39.136
This was the mean one.

00:39.138 --> 00:41.162
No, it isn't. It's the exact same one.

00:41.187 --> 00:42.453
It was the mean one, Katie.

00:43.615 --> 00:45.648
Well, he's gonna be delicious.

00:45.673 --> 00:47.773
Can you say a prayer for Jerome?

00:48.267 --> 00:49.647
Uh...

00:49.649 --> 00:50.848
Sure, Butter Bean.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.017
Yeah, uh, let's see, uh...

00:53.856 --> 00:55.953
Jerome...

00:56.426 --> 00:57.788
You had a good life.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.256
And though you were very mean

00:59.258 --> 01:02.476
and not the turkey that Teddy fed,

01:02.501 --> 01:04.881
we promise your death won't be in vain.

01:05.513 --> 01:07.431
We will not fill up on bread, amen.

01:07.433 --> 01:08.866
Amen.

01:08.868 --> 01:10.434
All right, good.

01:12.450 --> 01:14.872
Hey. Why are you guys here?

01:14.874 --> 01:16.106
Principal's office.

01:16.108 --> 01:17.207
My kid's pet snake

01:17.232 --> 01:19.371
got out of his backpack.

01:19.396 --> 01:22.030
And I'm standing here
because I'm frozen with fear.

01:22.802 --> 01:25.516
What? Just because that little
snake on the floor behind you?

01:27.887 --> 01:30.588
I hated that, but I
loved the camaraderie.

01:30.683 --> 01:32.873
Okay. All right, I got
to bring Emme her lunch.

01:32.898 --> 01:34.291
Why didn't you have Andi bring it?

01:34.293 --> 01:35.844
- Well, she's at work.
- No, she's not.

01:35.869 --> 01:37.329
She's in there with Mrs. Rodriguez.

01:37.496 --> 01:39.863
What?

01:42.335 --> 01:43.184
Hey.

01:43.209 --> 01:44.842
Adam. What are you doing here?

01:44.844 --> 01:46.810
Well, Emme forgot her lunch, uh...

01:47.007 --> 01:48.183
What are you doing here?

01:48.526 --> 01:51.114
I could ask you the same question.

01:52.050 --> 01:53.951
You just did, and I answered it.

01:53.953 --> 01:55.886
What... what's going on?

01:55.935 --> 01:58.002
Oh, nothing. I was
just on my lunch break,

01:58.027 --> 01:59.866
I thought I'd, uh, pop in.

02:01.242 --> 02:02.559
Okay, you're biting your lower lip,

02:02.561 --> 02:04.094
which means you've
done something horrible.

02:04.096 --> 02:05.395
What'd you do?

02:05.397 --> 02:06.763
Was it something at home?

02:06.765 --> 02:08.699
Did you throw out my antlers?

02:08.701 --> 02:11.033
- No!
- Singing fish?

02:11.036 --> 02:13.307
Mr. Burns, Andi came by to discuss

02:13.332 --> 02:15.532
the school's Thanksgiving
party next week.

02:15.534 --> 02:16.800
As the room parent, I assume

02:16.802 --> 02:18.677
you've been reading all
the e-mails I sent you?

02:18.702 --> 02:20.735
Let's not play this
game. You know I haven't.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.475
As I explained, we will need

02:24.477 --> 02:26.376
an entire Thanksgiving
dinner for 30 people.

02:26.378 --> 02:28.212
Full spread, by Wednesday.

02:28.214 --> 02:30.380
Well, I think I can speak
for all parents when I say

02:30.382 --> 02:32.216
that sounds like a bummer.

02:33.157 --> 02:35.744
Which is why, even
though you're room parent,

02:35.769 --> 02:38.043
I think Andi should
handle organizing it.

02:38.045 --> 02:40.612
Those are the sweetest
words I've ever heard.

02:40.614 --> 02:44.082
Now I know what I'm thankful
for this Thanksgiving.

02:44.084 --> 02:45.366
Well, good! I'm glad you're happy.

02:45.391 --> 02:47.552
Oh, very thoughtful
of you, Mrs. Rodriguez.

02:47.554 --> 02:49.054
Wasn't my idea.

02:49.056 --> 02:51.690
Andi called me,
concerned you'd need help.

02:52.159 --> 02:54.426
Whoa. Go... hold on a
second, you called her?

02:54.428 --> 02:56.094
- No.
- Yes.

02:58.799 --> 02:59.672
Just tell me the truth.

02:59.697 --> 03:01.382
Fine.

03:02.304 --> 03:03.812
Adam, I threw out your singing fish.

03:03.837 --> 03:06.078
Hold on, hold on.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.036
You schemed and plotted with...

03:08.061 --> 03:09.740
don't take this the wrong way...

03:09.765 --> 03:12.187
my archenemy?

03:12.212 --> 03:14.312
Because you don't
think I'm capable of...

03:14.337 --> 03:15.669
cooking a meal?

03:15.782 --> 03:16.650
Look, I don't care

03:16.675 --> 03:18.093
if she thinks I can't do it.

03:18.118 --> 03:20.045
I care if you think it.

03:20.070 --> 03:22.303
Does it help if we both think it?

03:24.000 --> 03:30.074

03:34.721 --> 03:36.519
Hi. Hi, Jerome.

03:36.544 --> 03:37.456
Oh, you don't get

03:37.481 --> 03:39.648
to talk to him.

03:42.159 --> 03:44.648
What is your problem?
Why are you so upset?

03:44.673 --> 03:47.373
Because we're supposed to be a team.

03:47.398 --> 03:49.300
I'm Batman and you're Robin.

03:49.302 --> 03:51.469
And I just walked into
the Batcave and caught you

03:51.471 --> 03:54.372
planning a Thanksgiving
party with the Joker!

03:55.682 --> 03:57.308
Okay, first of all, I am not Robin,

03:57.310 --> 03:59.177
I am Mrs. Batman.

03:59.179 --> 04:01.385
There is no Mrs. Batman.

04:01.410 --> 04:03.047
Have you seen the Batcave?

04:03.049 --> 04:05.416
Only a woman could've put that together.

04:05.418 --> 04:09.020
Look, this Thanksgiving
party is just too much work.

04:09.022 --> 04:11.951
I mean, when I did it in the
past, it took weeks of planning.

04:11.976 --> 04:13.942
And... and you haven't
even read her e-mails.

04:13.967 --> 04:15.434
Well, neither have you.

04:15.499 --> 04:17.134
Well, yeah, I did.

04:17.159 --> 04:19.374
She blind CC'd me on everything.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.321
I can't believe she did that.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.513
What is that?

04:24.671 --> 04:26.345
It means she puts me on all the e-mails

04:26.370 --> 04:27.702
and just hides my address.

04:27.907 --> 04:29.300
Now, why would she do that?

04:29.325 --> 04:30.457
Well, because, I...

04:30.482 --> 04:34.084
She... somebody asked her to do it, I...

04:34.347 --> 04:36.113
I haven't even screwed anything up yet,

04:36.115 --> 04:37.700
and you're already
sticking your nose in.

04:37.725 --> 04:39.741
You know what I think?

04:39.766 --> 04:41.926
I think you're the one
with the problem. Not me.

04:41.951 --> 04:44.091
Oh, that is so ridiculous,
I can't even laugh.

04:44.116 --> 04:45.949
Oh, no. Wait. Yes, I can.

04:45.974 --> 04:47.252
You're so off.

04:47.277 --> 04:50.046
This isn't about me.
This is about your need

04:50.071 --> 04:52.148
to be in control. That's the point.

04:52.173 --> 04:55.510
No, no, no. The point is that
you're completely overreacting

04:55.535 --> 04:56.991
because your pride is wounded.

04:57.016 --> 05:00.338
See? You're even controlling
what I think the point is.

05:00.340 --> 05:02.206
Okay, here's what's gonna happen.

05:02.208 --> 05:04.942
I'm gonna do this
thing without your help.

05:04.944 --> 05:07.607
- Well, you can't do it all yourself.
- I won't be.

05:07.632 --> 05:10.734
I'll send out an e-mail,
and I'll blind CC myself,

05:11.320 --> 05:13.301
and I'll tell all the other
parents to bring something.

05:13.326 --> 05:14.957
So, you just stay out of it.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.857
Okay. Fine.

05:16.882 --> 05:18.763
Thank you. Now, if you'll please leave,

05:18.798 --> 05:20.998
all this conflict is
not good for Jerome.

05:24.954 --> 05:26.882
When I pull off this Thanksgiving party,

05:26.907 --> 05:30.375
Andi's gonna know who wears
the cape in this family.

05:30.507 --> 05:33.341
Cape? What are you
guys doing over there?

05:33.913 --> 05:35.245
I say just let Andi do it.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.677
No. No. I said I was gonna do this job,

05:37.702 --> 05:39.835
and I'm gonna do it as well as I can.

05:39.837 --> 05:42.171
I have this crazy thing called pride.

05:42.173 --> 05:44.940
You're looking at this school
Thanksgiving thing all wrong.

05:44.942 --> 05:46.842
You hate being room parent, right?

05:46.844 --> 05:47.681
Yeah, so?

05:47.706 --> 05:50.252
Then my advice is, you totally blow it.

05:50.303 --> 05:53.805
Once you screw something up,
no one asks you to do it again.

05:54.273 --> 05:57.519
I only had to be a
pallbearer that one time.

05:57.521 --> 05:59.098
Yeah. You know, you should be careful,

05:59.123 --> 06:00.422
'cause some of those relatives

06:00.447 --> 06:02.030
are gonna have to carry you one day.

06:02.055 --> 06:04.689
Nope. Blasting my ashes
right up into space.

06:04.962 --> 06:07.040
I'm just saying, it just
sounds like a lot of work.

06:07.065 --> 06:09.946
Not if you have a crew. I
got the drywall guys making me

06:09.971 --> 06:12.571
paper hand turkeys.

06:13.076 --> 06:15.654
Hey, Kowalski. You
call that a hand turkey?

06:15.679 --> 06:18.180
Kowalski's only got three fingers.

06:19.996 --> 06:22.496
Sorry, buddy. Thumbs-up.

06:22.780 --> 06:24.246
No thumb.

06:26.703 --> 06:27.638
Okay.

06:27.663 --> 06:29.463
Turkey place cards, check.

06:29.887 --> 06:31.411
Tablecloth, check.

06:31.436 --> 06:33.336
Decorations, check.

06:33.361 --> 06:36.362
Redemption? A-check.

06:36.726 --> 06:38.460
Yeah. Real impressive.

06:38.462 --> 06:40.262
But this is the sound
of people not asking you

06:40.287 --> 06:42.092
to do stuff anymore.

06:43.959 --> 06:44.944
Hear that?

06:45.045 --> 06:46.511
Those are freedom bubbles.

06:53.740 --> 06:54.795
Hello, pilgrims.

06:55.022 --> 06:55.724
I couldn't wait

06:55.749 --> 06:56.984
for the school Thanksgiving tomorrow.

06:57.009 --> 06:58.431
I had to bring you my side dish tonight.

06:58.456 --> 07:00.423
Oh, you're a good man, Lowell.

07:00.487 --> 07:03.385
Not sure how you got my address,
but we'll talk about that later.

07:03.579 --> 07:05.345
What do you got? Mashed
potatoes, green beans?

07:05.370 --> 07:07.370
Better. Foie gras

07:07.395 --> 07:09.495
Brussels sprouts in a pomegranate glaze

07:09.520 --> 07:11.887
with juniper berries,
thyme leaves, and farro.

07:12.517 --> 07:13.749
I love this guy.

07:13.774 --> 07:16.114
He's always swinging for the fences.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.180
Well, we can use it to scare the kids

07:18.205 --> 07:19.638
into eating the other vegetables.

07:21.992 --> 07:23.871
- Hey, Andi.
- Oh, hey, Lowell.

07:23.896 --> 07:25.795
That is...

07:25.876 --> 07:26.706
what is that?

07:26.731 --> 07:28.388
Oh, no, no, don't make him say it again.

07:29.689 --> 07:30.986
Oh, um, Don, uh,

07:31.011 --> 07:32.351
we're headed over your house

07:32.376 --> 07:33.624
to help Marcy make all the sides

07:33.649 --> 07:35.985
- for the family Thanksgiving.
- Oh, good.

07:36.188 --> 07:38.887
I felt bad leaving her
to do it all by herself.

07:42.252 --> 07:43.719
What smells?

07:43.908 --> 07:45.741
It's this guy.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.599
Teddy, don't be rude.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.397
Remember the rule that we
learned at Grandma's house?

07:50.422 --> 07:52.277
When something smells,
we don't talk about it.

07:52.302 --> 07:53.019
All right?

07:53.044 --> 07:54.910
Come on, wait for me in the car.

07:56.219 --> 07:57.986
Your children are lovely.

08:00.367 --> 08:01.273
So, uh...

08:01.298 --> 08:02.664
how's it going down here?

08:02.689 --> 08:03.501
Great, yeah,

08:03.526 --> 08:05.196
the dishes have started rolling in,

08:05.221 --> 08:06.443
my crew made me 30

08:06.468 --> 08:08.935
fun and festive turkey place cards.

08:09.396 --> 08:10.365
So, you don't need me.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.190
Nope. I could just...

08:12.223 --> 08:13.556
leave you here to do it all yourself.

08:13.581 --> 08:15.481
- Yup.
- Okay, well,

08:15.506 --> 08:16.715
great 'cause...

08:16.740 --> 08:18.201
you know, I'm never happier

08:18.226 --> 08:20.193
than when you can handle
it all on your own and...

08:20.453 --> 08:22.253
I can just stay out of it.

08:22.278 --> 08:23.122
Doesn't sound like it.

08:23.147 --> 08:24.279
Bye-bye.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.837
Oh, wait, um, real quick,

08:25.862 --> 08:27.702
um, some of the kids are
allergic to nuts, okay?

08:27.727 --> 08:28.988
So, don't bring any pecan pies.

08:29.013 --> 08:31.046
Oh, and there's always
one kid who picks up

08:31.071 --> 08:33.672
a gourd and pretends it...

08:34.693 --> 08:35.609
Sorry.

08:35.634 --> 08:36.467
Felt like you couldn't

08:36.493 --> 08:38.359
pull the trigger on that one.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.431
Then Adam actually had the nerve

08:53.433 --> 08:55.633
to accuse me of always
having to be in control.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.268
But that's true, right?

08:57.270 --> 08:59.637
Yes, that's why I'm so upset.

09:00.372 --> 09:01.772
Look, I know it's hard,

09:01.774 --> 09:03.474
but you just have to back off.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.312
I mean,

09:04.337 --> 09:06.291
would you do everything
better and smarter?

09:06.316 --> 09:07.278
Of course, you're a woman.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.713
We're better and smarter.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.772
Maybe that's why we
live longer, you know?

09:11.797 --> 09:13.784
So at the end, we can
have just a few years

09:13.786 --> 09:15.519
- of things being right.
- Mm.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.455
Everything's gonna be

09:17.457 --> 09:19.457
so clean then.

09:19.459 --> 09:20.862
I just wish I knew

09:20.887 --> 09:22.432
what was happening over there, you know?

09:22.457 --> 09:23.276
I mean,

09:23.301 --> 09:24.260
how bad would it be

09:24.285 --> 09:25.888
if I checked his e-mails
from the other parents?

09:25.913 --> 09:27.579
I mean, just to make sure
that he's in good shape.

09:27.667 --> 09:28.690
Oh, I say go for it.

09:28.715 --> 09:30.208
I check Don's e-mails
more than he does.

09:30.233 --> 09:31.096
Oh.

09:34.274 --> 09:37.508
Okay, Jerome, sleep tight, buddy.

09:38.790 --> 09:40.318
I'm not a turkey guy.

09:40.343 --> 09:41.288
I grew up on a farm

09:41.313 --> 09:42.251
and I won't eat anything

09:42.276 --> 09:43.342
that beat me in a fight.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.301
Okay.

09:47.464 --> 09:49.810
Oh, you coming back in? Okay.

09:51.740 --> 09:53.673
All right, time to check and see

09:53.698 --> 09:55.459
what the other parents are bringing.

09:55.461 --> 09:58.296
Ooh, you have 20 unread e-mails.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.897
You must feel like a celebrity.

10:01.782 --> 10:03.601
Yeah, the other parents
were blowing me off,

10:03.603 --> 10:04.363
so I had to hit them

10:04.388 --> 10:06.805
with a sharply worded
reminder last night.

10:07.402 --> 10:09.440
Your life's brutal.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.146
Okay, we're off to a good start.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.181
Marie says she's bringing the turkey.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.083
Uh... someone's bringing napkins.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.646
That's good.

10:20.671 --> 10:22.420
Uh... someone else is bringing napkins.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.088
Plenty of those.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.208
More napkins.

10:26.233 --> 10:28.133
Napkins...

10:28.294 --> 10:29.660
napkins.

10:30.375 --> 10:31.662
Lowell, I got a serious problem here.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.264
Everyone's bringing napkins.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.118
Not everyone.

10:34.143 --> 10:36.000
Lily's dad is bringing paper towels.

10:36.002 --> 10:38.703
That's just napkins on a stick.

10:39.411 --> 10:40.544
On the bright side,

10:40.569 --> 10:41.683
this is going to make my dish

10:41.708 --> 10:43.140
the star of the party.

10:44.618 --> 10:45.710
Napkins.

10:45.712 --> 10:48.179
The other parents are
just bringing napkins.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.245
You know what, that does it.

10:49.270 --> 10:50.582
Marcy, get out more potatoes.

10:50.607 --> 10:52.380
We got to cook enough sides for 30 kids.

10:52.405 --> 10:53.995
I thought you were staying out of it.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.320
Well, I can't just do nothing.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.223
It's like watching a turtle
try to cross the highway.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.325
He's never gonna make it.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.928
In that case, somebody
better bring a shovel.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.231
None of the other parents
are picking up the phone.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.499
I got no side dishes!

11:09.135 --> 11:10.801
That people will eat.

11:12.493 --> 11:13.704
Congratulations.

11:13.706 --> 11:14.672
For what?

11:14.674 --> 11:16.117
For blowing the school Thanksgiving.

11:16.790 --> 11:19.056
They won't ask you to
do anything ever again.

11:21.599 --> 11:22.959
Maybe it's time to call Andi.

11:22.999 --> 11:25.833
No. No, I'm not calling Andi.

11:25.918 --> 11:28.386
If I do, it'll upset the
whole balance of power.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.921
I'll be... I'll be Robin.

11:31.870 --> 11:32.423
So what?

11:32.425 --> 11:34.058
You still get to go on the adventures.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.394
You just won't have to
make any of the decisions.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.230
That's how it is in my marriage.

11:39.232 --> 11:42.199
Come on in, the water's fine.

11:42.793 --> 11:43.749
You know what, I think I could still

11:43.751 --> 11:45.284
pull this off without her.

11:45.286 --> 11:46.719
I got my place cards.

11:46.721 --> 11:48.133
Marie's bringing the turkey.

11:48.158 --> 11:51.339
I got your hoity-toity
prison food casserole.

11:52.034 --> 11:53.225
All I need is the other stuff.

11:53.227 --> 11:54.226
Other stuff meaning

11:54.228 --> 11:55.694
enough food for 30 people?

11:55.696 --> 11:57.396
Yeah, it could be done, right?

11:57.398 --> 11:58.225
Let's see.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.565
Side dishes, potatoes,

11:59.567 --> 12:01.467
gravy, stuffing, pies...

12:01.492 --> 12:02.767
If the three of us...

12:02.792 --> 12:03.892
The two of you.

12:06.017 --> 12:09.144
... pull together, we can do anything.

12:09.169 --> 12:10.602
I'm here for you until the end.

12:10.711 --> 12:12.021
Oh.

12:12.825 --> 12:13.779
Oop, I got to go.

12:15.245 --> 12:16.674
What? What's wrong?

12:16.699 --> 12:17.823
My wife texted.

12:17.848 --> 12:18.967
We're trying to have another baby

12:18.992 --> 12:20.358
and she's ovulating.

12:21.049 --> 12:21.989
She's already ankles up

12:22.014 --> 12:24.515
in the swing chair, waiting for me.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.379
That guy continues to surprise me.

12:31.298 --> 12:34.110
Well, there goes any chance of
us actually cooking this dinner.

12:35.110 --> 12:35.983
Okay, we need

12:36.008 --> 12:37.541
a plan “B.”

12:37.987 --> 12:39.304
We just go out and buy it?

12:41.442 --> 12:42.608
Yes!

12:42.610 --> 12:44.643
Now you're thinking.

12:44.645 --> 12:46.779
Hey, I'm always
thinking, little brother.

12:46.781 --> 12:49.017
Who went to six months
of community college?

12:52.082 --> 12:53.448
Okay. Okay, here's a place

12:53.473 --> 12:54.535
that's open 24 hours,

12:54.560 --> 12:56.171
and, uh... yes!

12:56.196 --> 12:57.630
They cater Thanksgiving.

12:57.655 --> 13:01.791
Okay, $28.50 a head times
30 people, that's... uh...

13:01.924 --> 13:03.223
Well, you got to simplify.

13:03.248 --> 13:05.115
Three times three is nine. We know that.

13:05.140 --> 13:06.172
Yeah, yeah, okay.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.566
$28.50, so, you, uh...

13:07.568 --> 13:10.235
subtract $1.50 from 30 and, uh...

13:10.237 --> 13:11.387
I got this, I got this.

13:11.412 --> 13:12.578
Okay, you take the five

13:12.673 --> 13:15.140
from the zero and that's, uh...

13:16.510 --> 13:18.343
... $28.50.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.480
That's where we started!

13:21.482 --> 13:23.148
All right, let's try this again.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.650
All right, three times three is nine.

13:24.652 --> 13:26.251
That's locked in.

13:26.918 --> 13:29.354
Oh, forget it, it's
almost a thousand dollars.

13:30.414 --> 13:32.219
Wait a minute, I think I got this.

13:32.626 --> 13:34.560
We need Thanksgiving side dishes, right?

13:34.562 --> 13:35.140
Yeah.

13:35.165 --> 13:36.549
That's exactly what our wives

13:36.574 --> 13:37.895
are making right now.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.131
We need that food.

13:39.133 --> 13:40.532
But, if we're using their food,

13:40.534 --> 13:42.209
isn't that like using Andi's help?

13:42.234 --> 13:44.267
Yeah, but not if she
doesn't know about it.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.721
Oh...

13:47.286 --> 13:48.886
Nope, still don't get it.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.211
Hey, uh, Dad just texted me.

13:52.213 --> 13:53.774
He wants to know if
you're finished cooking

13:53.799 --> 13:55.681
and if the coast is
clear in the kitchen?

13:57.118 --> 13:58.700
Oh, here's another one.

13:58.757 --> 14:00.790
“Don't tell your mom I asked.”

14:01.789 --> 14:04.022
Why would he care if
we're in the kitchen?

14:04.291 --> 14:06.492
Oh, my God. They're coming for the food.

14:06.494 --> 14:07.985
- Hmm.
- They're not even gonna ask us,

14:08.010 --> 14:09.094
they're just gonna take it.

14:09.096 --> 14:11.430
This sounds like a Don idea.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
though. They don't know

14:14.335 --> 14:16.101
we made all this extra
food for the school.

14:16.126 --> 14:17.604
That means they're willing to run off

14:17.629 --> 14:19.190
with our family Thanksgiving.

14:19.215 --> 14:21.682
It's like the idiot's
version of Ocean's Eleven.

14:22.910 --> 14:24.772
You know what, sweetie? I'm
glad you're here to see this

14:24.797 --> 14:26.947
because no matter how
good they look in a tuxedo,

14:26.972 --> 14:28.271
this is where it ends up.

14:49.985 --> 14:51.737
How did you get in here?

14:51.978 --> 14:54.072
The door.

14:54.074 --> 14:55.507
You got no style.

14:59.780 --> 15:01.157
Oh, look at this.

15:01.182 --> 15:02.614
The mother lode.

15:02.639 --> 15:05.073
Stuffing, mashed potatoes,

15:05.152 --> 15:07.419
cranberry salad,

15:07.815 --> 15:09.112
deviled eggs.

15:09.137 --> 15:10.637
Huh?

15:11.315 --> 15:12.457
Hang on.

15:12.573 --> 15:13.873
She made all these deviled eggs

15:13.898 --> 15:15.961
for our little family Thanksgiving?

15:15.963 --> 15:18.363
Mmm. This stuffing is righteous.

15:18.786 --> 15:21.067
- Mmm.
- Will you put that down!

15:22.465 --> 15:24.503
They're not even trying to be quiet.

15:24.505 --> 15:26.838
Who stops in the middle of this to eat?

15:26.840 --> 15:28.404
That would be Don.

15:28.429 --> 15:29.631
Last summer, at the state fair,

15:29.656 --> 15:30.855
he lost a game of tic-tac-toe

15:30.880 --> 15:32.179
to a chicken.

15:33.950 --> 15:34.961
Something's not right.

15:34.986 --> 15:36.485
There's too much of everything.

15:36.550 --> 15:37.716
Don, check the cranberry salad.

15:37.718 --> 15:38.951
Does it look like it's for a family

15:38.953 --> 15:40.285
or 30 kindergarteners?

15:40.754 --> 15:41.520
It's hard to tell,

15:41.522 --> 15:43.388
there's 30 individual cups.

15:44.348 --> 15:45.385
Unbelievable.

15:45.410 --> 15:47.077
Andi made all of this for me.

15:47.228 --> 15:49.461
I knew she couldn't
keep her nose out of it.

15:49.463 --> 15:50.297
I'll bet you

15:50.322 --> 15:52.322
they're watching us right now.

15:58.172 --> 15:59.471
Aha!

15:59.473 --> 16:01.348
No, no, no, no, no. Aha!

16:01.373 --> 16:02.572
You said you were gonna stay out of it.

16:02.597 --> 16:04.063
You said you were gonna handle it.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.701
- This is me handling it.
- Oh, yeah?

16:05.726 --> 16:06.745
By stealing from me?

16:06.747 --> 16:08.814
Why can't you just admit
that you need my help?

16:08.816 --> 16:10.472
Why can't you just
admit that you need me

16:10.497 --> 16:11.350
to need your help?

16:11.352 --> 16:12.697
Fine, yes. I do!

16:12.722 --> 16:14.186
Aha! For real, this time.

16:14.188 --> 16:15.196
Okay.

16:16.125 --> 16:16.955
Aha!

16:16.957 --> 16:18.133
Whoa...

16:21.078 --> 16:23.768
Look, I admit that
tonight, when I found out

16:23.793 --> 16:25.063
that everybody was bringing napkins,

16:25.065 --> 16:26.565
I-I was a little happy.

16:26.567 --> 16:28.019
And there it is.

16:28.044 --> 16:29.234
But only because...

16:29.236 --> 16:31.336
I like it when you need me. I need it.

16:31.338 --> 16:32.771
It's why I married someone so...

16:32.773 --> 16:34.840
Hey, step careful here.

16:36.311 --> 16:37.909
Perfectly imperfect.

16:38.464 --> 16:39.845
I'll take it.

16:40.529 --> 16:42.122
I mean, when I went back to work

16:42.147 --> 16:43.435
and you took over all the kid stuff,

16:43.460 --> 16:44.399
I thought...

16:44.424 --> 16:45.548
I don't know, I'd have to be

16:45.573 --> 16:46.729
jumping in to save the day,

16:46.754 --> 16:48.287
but you've been just fine.

16:48.787 --> 16:49.488
It just...

16:49.490 --> 16:51.623
it made me feel like I'm not necessary.

16:52.880 --> 16:53.825
Oh,

16:53.827 --> 16:56.028
you make it so hard to fight you now!

16:57.229 --> 16:58.363
Come here.

16:59.767 --> 17:01.233
I need you.

17:01.235 --> 17:02.768
You're just not supposed to know it.

17:04.178 --> 17:06.512
Boo! We came for a fight.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.108
Don't worry, Don. You'll get one.

17:10.383 --> 17:11.715
Boo...

17:12.941 --> 17:14.479
Let's get all this food
and get out of here.

17:14.481 --> 17:15.525
Okay.

17:18.353 --> 17:20.952
Wait, how did you know
everyone was bringing napkins?

17:21.454 --> 17:24.340
Aw, honey, we already
hugged. No more questions.

17:27.075 --> 17:29.229
Okay, thanks, guys. Head upstairs.

17:29.292 --> 17:30.893
And don't forget to brush your teeth.

17:32.275 --> 17:33.832
They're not gonna brush their teeth.

17:33.834 --> 17:36.168
Well, you said it. That's
all that matters in court.

17:37.304 --> 17:39.462
Hey, look, thanks for helping.

17:39.487 --> 17:40.981
I couldn't have done
all this without you.

17:41.006 --> 17:42.826
Well, this is why our marriage works.

17:43.010 --> 17:44.543
I need you, you need me.

17:44.795 --> 17:47.629
And together, we make
one whole needy person.

17:47.846 --> 17:50.237
And now, we are gonna crush
this Thanksgiving party

17:50.262 --> 17:52.684
the same way we crush
marriage and parenting.

17:52.686 --> 17:55.620
Yep. Half-assed and
just in the nick of time.

17:59.727 --> 18:01.193
Oh.

18:01.195 --> 18:02.594
- Hey, Marie.
- Hi.

18:02.596 --> 18:03.694
Sorry to come by so late,

18:03.719 --> 18:05.729
I won't be at school tomorrow, so

18:05.754 --> 18:07.299
I figured I'd drop this off now.

18:07.301 --> 18:08.400
Good old Marie.

18:08.402 --> 18:09.171
Bringing the turkey,

18:09.196 --> 18:11.035
the last piece of the puzzle.

18:11.089 --> 18:13.105
Let's take a look.

18:14.942 --> 18:16.100
That's not a turkey.

18:16.125 --> 18:18.492
That's chicken wings in
the shape of a turkey.

18:20.026 --> 18:22.137
Yeah. I totally forgot
about making the turkey

18:22.162 --> 18:24.796
till I was sitting at Hooters.

18:25.760 --> 18:28.037
Huh. I didn't know
women went to Hooters.

18:28.062 --> 18:30.522
'Cause, you know, we already have 'em.

18:31.548 --> 18:34.426
Nah, it's great. Guys always
go there thinking they're gonna

18:34.428 --> 18:36.139
take home a waitress, but...

18:36.164 --> 18:39.399
when last call rolls around,
it's my turn to be picky.

18:40.868 --> 18:42.534
Happy Thanksgiving.

18:46.243 --> 18:47.305
I...

18:47.307 --> 18:50.342
I can't serve chicken
wings at Thanksgiving.

18:50.344 --> 18:51.537
Well, what choice do we have?

18:51.562 --> 18:53.461
We don't have another turkey.

18:56.055 --> 18:58.137
Well, there is Jerome.

18:58.162 --> 18:59.895
Oh. No, honey, I can't let you do that.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.421
You love that salty bastard.

19:04.458 --> 19:05.749
You're right. I do.

19:05.774 --> 19:09.119
Besides, the last thing you
rubbed that much, you married.

19:10.560 --> 19:11.530
Yeah, I did.

19:11.532 --> 19:13.799
Yeah, you did.

19:20.113 --> 19:22.146
Well, honey, looks
like we pulled it off.

19:22.148 --> 19:23.581
Yeah, this is delicious.

19:23.583 --> 19:25.483
- And sorry I forgot the napkins.
- Uh.

19:25.508 --> 19:28.329
That's okay. About 15
other people had your back.

19:28.354 --> 19:30.718
You know, you don't usually

19:30.743 --> 19:32.772
think of Hooters chicken
wings for Thanksgiving,

19:32.797 --> 19:34.225
but I got to say, I like it.

19:34.227 --> 19:37.719
Yeah. Wait. How do you
know they're Hooters wings?

19:38.625 --> 19:41.042
I worked my way through college.

19:41.493 --> 19:43.861
Wow. I did not see that coming.

19:43.886 --> 19:46.011
I mean, I did... but I didn't.

19:46.978 --> 19:47.672
Lowell,

19:47.674 --> 19:49.507
I never thought I'd say this, but...

19:49.509 --> 19:51.609
hit me with some more of that casserole.

19:52.003 --> 19:54.461
- You want seconds?
- Yeah, once you get used to the smell,

19:54.485 --> 19:55.614
it works. it works.

19:56.699 --> 19:58.212
I've never felt taller.

19:59.631 --> 20:00.983
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

20:01.008 --> 20:02.509
Happy Thanksgiving.

20:04.118 --> 20:09.118
