WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:02.346
Last week...

00:02.370 --> 00:04.604
That's one small step for man,

00:04.639 --> 00:07.768
one giant leap for MasterChef.

00:07.769 --> 00:09.469
That is awesome.

00:09.504 --> 00:13.306
The top 20 faced an
out-of-this-world challenge.

00:13.341 --> 00:16.209
This dish is going
to send the judges to the moon.

00:16.244 --> 00:19.112
Kaitlyn and
Nate rocketed to the top.

00:19.147 --> 00:20.391
- Great job.
- This is the best

00:20.415 --> 00:23.316
dish I've had
in the MasterChef kitchen.

00:23.351 --> 00:26.619
While Kyndall and Vivian
crashed out of the competition.

00:26.654 --> 00:28.855
- Keep cooking!
- Bye, guys.

00:30.658 --> 00:31.924
Tonight...

00:31.960 --> 00:35.328
The seven-layer dip
building starts now!

00:35.363 --> 00:38.231
It's the first
ever MasterChef <i> relay race.</i>

00:38.266 --> 00:42.001
Smash those beans
like your life depends on it!

00:42.037 --> 00:44.937
But it's the
judges who taste victory.

00:44.973 --> 00:47.974
I'm going to
smash him on his head!

00:48.009 --> 00:50.009
And then a
tricky elimination test...

00:50.045 --> 00:51.010
Ugh!
What?

00:51.046 --> 00:52.612
That stinks.

00:52.647 --> 00:54.580
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ugh!

00:54.616 --> 00:55.915
Does anyone smell that?

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.334 --> 01:18.271
I am super-duper excited
that I got into the top 18.

01:18.306 --> 01:19.605
Wow.

01:19.641 --> 01:21.007
Oh, my gosh.

01:21.042 --> 01:25.211
I have a 1-in-18 chance of
bringing that MasterChef trophy

01:25.246 --> 01:27.180
back with me to New Jersey,

01:27.215 --> 01:29.749
and I am not going home
empty-handed.

01:29.784 --> 01:31.184
Yeah, that's good.

01:31.219 --> 01:32.219
Welcome back, everyone.

01:32.253 --> 01:35.688
Now there are just
18 of you left.

01:35.723 --> 01:37.857
One of you talented home cooks

01:37.892 --> 01:41.127
will be crowned America's next
MasterChef Junior.

01:43.264 --> 01:45.598
It's time to
find out what all of you

01:45.633 --> 01:49.569
are going to have
to make for tonight's challenge.

01:49.604 --> 01:50.837
It's an American classic

01:50.872 --> 01:54.107
eaten in millions of homes
across this country...

01:54.142 --> 01:56.976
Especially when there's
a big game going on.

01:57.011 --> 01:58.377
It's a dip.

01:58.413 --> 02:01.347
A classic dip
overflowing with awesomeness.

02:01.382 --> 02:02.982
It doesn't have one layer.

02:03.017 --> 02:05.318
It doesn't have two layers,
or three, four, five, or six.

02:05.353 --> 02:06.353
What?

02:10.558 --> 02:13.192
- It has seven.
- Whoa!

02:13.228 --> 02:16.429
That's right.
Seven-layer dip.

02:16.464 --> 02:21.968
Beans, corn, salsa,
lettuce, guacamole,

02:22.003 --> 02:25.538
sour cream and chives,
and cheese.

02:25.573 --> 02:28.508
Seven-layer dip,
I think is delicious.

02:28.543 --> 02:31.944
I wish I could just dive right
into it and swim in it.

02:31.980 --> 02:33.613
Oh, God.

02:33.648 --> 02:38.017
Now, a seven-layer dip
is a pretty big job to eat,

02:38.052 --> 02:40.520
and an even bigger job to make.

02:40.555 --> 02:45.124
But luckily you will not
be doing this alone.

02:45.160 --> 02:48.261
This will be
your first team challenge.

02:51.432 --> 02:54.834
We're going to split you
into three teams of six.

02:54.869 --> 02:57.103
Are you ready to find out
your teams tonight?

02:57.138 --> 02:59.739
Yes! Yeah!

02:59.774 --> 03:04.577
Ian, Avery, and Kya, you three
will be team captains tonight.

03:04.612 --> 03:07.046
Whoo hoo, yeah, Let's do this.

03:07.081 --> 03:10.816
Ian, joining you will be
Jesse, Amaya, JJ...

03:10.852 --> 03:11.817
- Yes!
- Yes!

03:11.853 --> 03:13.819
Zac, and Mia.

03:13.855 --> 03:15.788
- Good luck, Mia.
- Yes!

03:15.823 --> 03:18.224
I am so happy with my team.

03:18.259 --> 03:21.127
I got some big people
and some small people.

03:21.162 --> 03:22.962
Our team is going to win.

03:22.997 --> 03:26.899
Avery, joining you in
your team is Adam, Jaeclyn...

03:26.935 --> 03:31.337
- Hi, friend!
- Derek, Kaitlyn, and Tae-Ho.

03:31.372 --> 03:33.606
Yes!

03:33.641 --> 03:34.774
Avery's our team captain,

03:34.809 --> 03:36.509
and she's from,
like, bayou Louisiana,

03:36.544 --> 03:38.844
so I mean, she's not going
to put up with anything.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.546
She's going
to lead us to victory.

03:40.582 --> 03:44.650
Which means, Kya, you
are joined by Addison, Sam,

03:44.686 --> 03:47.987
Kamilly, Corey, and Nate.

03:48.022 --> 03:49.789
We got Addison and Kya.

03:49.824 --> 03:52.491
They are, like, two of
the best cooks in the kitchen.

03:52.527 --> 03:54.827
My team is going to win.

03:54.862 --> 03:57.830
All right, guys, so now
that you know your teams

03:57.865 --> 03:59.865
it's time to go
to your stations.

03:59.901 --> 04:01.901
Hmph!

04:01.936 --> 04:03.336
Let's go, guys!
We can do this.

04:06.541 --> 04:08.107
Do this!

04:08.142 --> 04:09.342
Now, this is something

04:09.377 --> 04:12.345
we've never done before
in this competition.

04:12.380 --> 04:15.181
This will actually be
our first ever

04:15.216 --> 04:19.685
MasterChef Junior relay race.

04:19.721 --> 04:21.786
You guys are each responsible

04:21.822 --> 04:23.556
for a layer in that dip.

04:23.591 --> 04:26.325
The beans which
you have to mash yourself.

04:26.361 --> 04:28.794
The corn that you
have to cut off the cob.

04:28.830 --> 04:31.497
Salsa which you're going
to have to mix together.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.866
Lettuce that you're going
to have to shred.

04:33.901 --> 04:36.969
A layer of Wholly Guacamole,
which is all natural,

04:37.005 --> 04:39.639
hand-scooped, and
made with fresh avocados.

04:39.674 --> 04:41.941
Since there are only six
of you per team,

04:41.976 --> 04:43.743
and seven layers,

04:43.778 --> 04:46.145
the last person
is doing two layers:

04:46.180 --> 04:48.247
Combining the sour cream
and chives

04:48.283 --> 04:52.118
and then piling all that yummy,
amazing cheese on top.

04:52.153 --> 04:54.253
Now, your giant container of dip

04:54.289 --> 04:59.058
cannot move forward until
the entire layer is finished.

04:59.093 --> 05:04.030
The winning team, the team
whose dip lands here first,

05:04.065 --> 05:08.134
will get to push
that judge's face...

05:08.169 --> 05:09.568
right in the dip.

05:13.574 --> 05:17.143
So, Kya, you'll be
going after me.

05:17.178 --> 05:18.578
- Is that okay?
- Yes, Chef!

05:19.747 --> 05:23.182
Avery, this face
is your team's target.

05:24.986 --> 05:28.321
Ian, that means
if your team wins,

05:28.356 --> 05:34.293
you get to push
this sweet, kind, caring face

05:34.329 --> 05:37.396
right into a bowl
of seven-layer dip.

05:37.432 --> 05:39.065
I want to see this.
Yeah, let's do this.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.366
So you're okay with that?

05:40.401 --> 05:43.135
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:43.171 --> 05:46.906
- Is everybody ready?
- Yes, Chef!

05:46.941 --> 05:50.943
Let the seven layers
of dip building start...

05:53.348 --> 05:54.348
Now!

05:58.886 --> 06:01.420
Wow, what an
exciting challenge this is.

06:01.456 --> 06:02.833
- Speed is of the essence.
- Absolutely.

06:02.857 --> 06:06.192
Smash those beans like
your life depends on it!

06:06.227 --> 06:08.094
- 'Cause it does!
- Yeah!

06:08.129 --> 06:09.540
Let's talk
about the beans first.

06:09.564 --> 06:11.263
You have to really
mash those beans

06:11.299 --> 06:13.632
to get them to a dip-like,
spreadable consistency.

06:13.668 --> 06:16.168
- Go, Kya!
- All your might!

06:16.204 --> 06:19.638
Ian, let's go!

06:19.674 --> 06:21.574
Avery, get the
beans in the bowl!

06:21.609 --> 06:24.143
- Avery!
- Go, Kya! Go, Kya!

06:24.178 --> 06:26.612
Avery, Kya's already done!

06:26.647 --> 06:28.781
Avery, put it in a bowl!

06:28.816 --> 06:30.116
Kya is motoring.

06:30.151 --> 06:32.585
That's not a good sign for me.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.387
- Here, go, go!
- Come on!

06:37.225 --> 06:40.025
Go!
We can't lose this!

06:40.061 --> 06:41.260
Each one of these stations

06:41.295 --> 06:43.362
is testing something
different, right?

06:43.398 --> 06:44.630
Knife skills.
Knife work.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.299
How you spread
those items into a bowl.

06:47.335 --> 06:49.769
- Argh!
- Go, JJ!

06:49.804 --> 06:51.370
Come on, Addy.

06:51.406 --> 06:53.773
- Go!
- Go, Amaya, go!

06:53.808 --> 06:55.941
Come on! Let's do this!

06:55.977 --> 06:57.676
Amaya is now on the corn.

06:57.712 --> 06:59.078
Yes.

06:59.113 --> 07:00.946
Come on! Go, Adam!

07:00.982 --> 07:03.082
Adam is also on the corn.

07:03.117 --> 07:05.484
Beautiful.
Go, Sam! Go, Sam!

07:05.520 --> 07:07.686
Sam is now on the tomatoes.

07:07.722 --> 07:10.489
- The third stage.
- Go faster!

07:10.525 --> 07:12.458
I'm going as fast as I can.

07:12.493 --> 07:14.727
Hurry up! They're in the lead.
Come on!

07:14.762 --> 07:15.895
Don't rush perfection!

07:15.930 --> 07:17.963
Hurry! Go Kaitlyn!

07:17.999 --> 07:20.699
- Go!
- Hurry! Go, go, go!

07:20.735 --> 07:23.102
Come on, Jesse!

07:23.137 --> 07:25.438
Good job, Sam!
Good job, Sam!

07:25.473 --> 07:27.773
Mix it up, fold it!
Mix it up, fold it!

07:27.809 --> 07:29.241
I'm trying!

07:29.277 --> 07:31.410
- Come on!
- Dump it all in.

07:31.446 --> 07:32.978
Yeah!
I love it.

07:33.014 --> 07:35.514
Come on, Kamilly, come on!
Shred that lettuce!

07:35.550 --> 07:37.783
- Kamilly is now on the lettuce.
- Yeah.

07:37.819 --> 07:40.085
She has her eye on the prize.

07:40.121 --> 07:42.321
It's all about the lettuce,
'cause that's the station

07:42.356 --> 07:43.789
that's going to make or break...

07:43.825 --> 07:46.692
The knife skills and the speed
of these home cooks.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.328
I have not seen her slice
that fast before

07:49.363 --> 07:50.729
in this entire competition.

07:50.765 --> 07:53.199
Go!
Take it, take it!

07:53.234 --> 07:56.268
- Come on! Let's do this!
- Yeah, JJ!

07:56.304 --> 07:58.582
All right, JJ is
starting to slice the lettuce,

07:58.606 --> 08:02.041
and he's not too far
behind Kamilly.

08:02.076 --> 08:04.243
- Let's go!
- Walk as fast as you can!

08:04.278 --> 08:06.312
Uh-oh.
Derek's got the lettuce,

08:06.347 --> 08:09.548
so now all three of our teams
are doing lettuce neck-and-neck.

08:09.584 --> 08:12.218
- Awesome job!
- Come on, Kamilly!

08:12.253 --> 08:14.353
Derek is catching up.

08:14.388 --> 08:18.257
Oh, Graham, Derek just
crushed the competition

08:18.292 --> 08:19.258
shredding that lettuce.

08:19.293 --> 08:20.493
No, no!

08:20.528 --> 08:22.795
Yes! Yes! Run up.

08:22.830 --> 08:25.064
We got to throw it.
Yes, yes!

08:25.099 --> 08:26.866
Your team is now ahead, buddy.

08:26.901 --> 08:28.100
You are in trouble.

08:28.135 --> 08:29.468
I got us the lead!

08:29.504 --> 08:32.071
Hurry up! JJ!

08:32.106 --> 08:34.807
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, come on, come on!

08:34.842 --> 08:37.176
Wow, look, now it's
all neck-and-neck again.

08:37.211 --> 08:39.979
It's anyone's game... it's all
on the guacamole right now.

08:40.014 --> 08:41.780
Kaitlyn, Zac, Corey.

08:41.816 --> 08:43.515
Hurry!
I'm trying to!

08:43.551 --> 08:45.062
And I think it's really cool
to have a challenge

08:45.086 --> 08:48.087
where the kids are actually
working with fresh ingredients,

08:48.122 --> 08:50.155
in this case, real avocados.

08:50.191 --> 08:52.224
No preservatives,
even gluten-free.

08:52.260 --> 08:53.726
Come on, Kaitlyn, you got this.

08:53.761 --> 08:54.927
You're in the lead.
Hurry!

08:54.962 --> 08:56.595
Kaitlyn is crushing
the Wholly Guacamole.

08:56.631 --> 08:59.798
- No! No!
- Ready, go! Go!

08:59.834 --> 09:01.800
- Yes, we're going to win!
- Go!

09:01.836 --> 09:03.736
- No!
- Tae-ho!

09:03.771 --> 09:04.811
It all comes down to this!

09:18.419 --> 09:21.120
Cheese, cheese.

09:21.155 --> 09:22.988
It's between Mia and Tae-Ho.

09:23.024 --> 09:25.591
- Come on!
- Cheese!

09:26.994 --> 09:28.360
- Hands up!
- Mia's got it.

09:29.664 --> 09:33.866
Congratulations, Ian's team.

09:33.901 --> 09:36.802
Now bring the seven-layer dip
up here,

09:36.837 --> 09:40.539
and I'd like all three captains

09:40.575 --> 09:43.242
to stand to
the right of us, please.

09:43.277 --> 09:45.110
Wow.

09:45.146 --> 09:46.579
Ian,

09:46.614 --> 09:51.183
you have the honor of dunking

09:51.218 --> 09:53.352
the world-renowned pastry chef

09:53.387 --> 09:54.920
Christina Tosi's head
in your dip.

09:54.956 --> 09:57.022
- Are you ready?
- Yes, Chef.

09:57.058 --> 09:58.857
On the count of three.

09:58.893 --> 10:01.760
Nothing in life
prepares you for this.

10:01.796 --> 10:04.763
One... two...

10:04.799 --> 10:07.800
Two-and-a-half...
three!

10:08.803 --> 10:12.671
- Oh!
- Oh!

10:12.707 --> 10:14.239
Oh, yeah, baby!

10:19.900 --> 10:22.000
On the count of three.

10:22.035 --> 10:27.138
One, two, three!

10:27.173 --> 10:28.706
Oh!

10:31.378 --> 10:34.078
Oh, yeah, baby!

10:34.114 --> 10:36.080
Good job, dude.

10:36.116 --> 10:37.448
You look amazing.

10:37.484 --> 10:38.650
Do you like my lettuce?

10:38.685 --> 10:41.152
I think that should be
your new look.

10:41.187 --> 10:42.465
- Wow.
- I have to say,

10:42.489 --> 10:43.708
it's like a day at the spa.

10:43.839 --> 10:45.205
The only issue

10:45.240 --> 10:48.742
I'm really having is it
just feels a little unfair.

10:48.777 --> 10:51.644
I feel like I really
need to share...

10:51.680 --> 10:53.279
- Yes.
- In this moment with Graham.

10:53.315 --> 10:55.235
Who would like to see
Graham's face dipped in it?

10:57.552 --> 10:59.185
No way!

10:59.221 --> 11:02.055
Graham, please give me these.

11:02.090 --> 11:06.626
- Don't do it.
- One, two, three. Go.

11:10.565 --> 11:13.266
Oh!

11:17.539 --> 11:19.239
Delicious.
Very nice.

11:19.274 --> 11:21.018
You know, I feel
like we're missing something.

11:21.042 --> 11:22.242
I do too.
I think that...

11:22.277 --> 11:24.177
It just feels like
we're leaving him out.

11:24.212 --> 11:26.713
I know, and I don't want
him to not feel included.

11:26.748 --> 11:28.393
You don't want me in there.
You don't want me in there.

11:28.417 --> 11:32.585
All kids: Yes!

11:32.621 --> 11:34.587
I'm gonna smash
Gordon Ramsay's face,

11:34.623 --> 11:38.124
and I'm going to make sure
it goes through every layer.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.860
One, two, three, four, five,

11:40.896 --> 11:43.196
six, seven.
Eeee.

11:43.231 --> 11:47.567
Kya, one, two, three.

11:47.602 --> 11:49.402
Do it!

11:54.176 --> 11:57.444
Look at that.

11:57.479 --> 11:59.078
Yay!

11:59.114 --> 12:01.347
Ew!

12:01.383 --> 12:04.517
Look at that.

12:04.553 --> 12:07.420
Who done the salsa?
There's no salt in that.

12:07.456 --> 12:10.223
Who forgot to season the salsa?

12:10.258 --> 12:11.624
Okay.

12:11.660 --> 12:14.127
Ian and your team,

12:14.162 --> 12:16.029
are you ready
to come through the pantry

12:16.064 --> 12:19.232
to see what your big
advantages are?

12:19.267 --> 12:20.934
Yes, Chef!

12:20.969 --> 12:22.836
- Let's go.
- Good job, guys.

12:22.871 --> 12:24.504
As winners of the first ever

12:24.539 --> 12:26.439
MasterChef Junior relay race,

12:26.475 --> 12:29.175
Ian, Amaya, JJ, Jesse,
Mia, and Zac

12:29.211 --> 12:34.147
are now in control
of the elimination test.

12:34.182 --> 12:35.782
At the end of this challenge

12:35.817 --> 12:40.386
at least two young home cooks
will leave the competition.

12:40.422 --> 12:42.400
For the first time ever
in the history of MasterChef

12:42.424 --> 12:46.860
we have an entire team
here in the MasterChef pantry.

12:46.895 --> 12:49.996
Now, guys, because you
seven-layer dipped yourselves

12:50.031 --> 12:52.799
to victory in
the last challenge,

12:52.834 --> 12:54.901
all six of you

12:54.936 --> 12:57.570
do not have to cook
in the upcoming elimination.

12:57.606 --> 12:59.672
Yes!

12:59.708 --> 13:01.207
Yeah!

13:01.243 --> 13:03.409
- And for your next advantage...
- Oh, yeah.

13:03.445 --> 13:06.846
All of you are going
to decide as a team

13:06.882 --> 13:09.983
what kind of dish everybody else
in that kitchen

13:10.018 --> 13:10.984
has to make tonight.

13:11.019 --> 13:12.085
Okay.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.531
We're all having
such an amazing time

13:13.555 --> 13:15.088
learning about you guys.

13:15.123 --> 13:18.725
Tonight we feel that it's time
for all of you to learn

13:18.760 --> 13:21.227
a little bit more about us.

13:21.263 --> 13:24.330
My friends and family,
if I asked them to describe me,

13:24.366 --> 13:28.101
would say at times
I can be a little...

13:30.472 --> 13:32.005
Ooh!
Spicy.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.273
Oh!

13:33.308 --> 13:36.643
Here you have things
like hot peppers, chili oil,

13:36.678 --> 13:40.713
wasabi root, horseradish,
ginger, cinnamon candies,

13:40.749 --> 13:42.348
and cinnamon oil.

13:42.384 --> 13:44.328
All right, next up you have
a group of ingredients

13:44.352 --> 13:46.786
that sometimes describe me,

13:46.821 --> 13:48.655
but only sometimes...

13:48.690 --> 13:50.723
Especially after
a long training run

13:50.759 --> 13:53.860
or hours pumping iron
in the gym.

13:53.895 --> 13:55.194
Yeah, right.

13:55.230 --> 13:58.231
I'm talking about...

13:59.668 --> 14:02.468
- Whoo!
- Stinky.

14:02.504 --> 14:03.636
Smelly.

14:03.672 --> 14:04.771
Ugh!

14:04.806 --> 14:06.973
Things like stinky cheeses,

14:07.008 --> 14:10.877
pickled eggs, truffle oil,
liver,

14:10.912 --> 14:14.247
and <i> huitlacoche</i> which is also
known as corn fungus.

14:14.282 --> 14:15.315
Bleah!

14:15.350 --> 14:17.016
Mmm.

14:17.052 --> 14:21.254
Now, under here are a group
of ingredients that...

14:21.289 --> 14:23.289
let me put it this way...
I've grown into...

14:23.325 --> 14:25.458
Especially as
I've got a little older.

14:25.493 --> 14:30.363
I'm talking about ingredients
that are a little bit, like me...

14:33.969 --> 14:36.769
- Vegetable-y?
- Wrinkly!

14:36.805 --> 14:38.705
I knew it.

14:38.740 --> 14:40.173
Oh, yeah, that works.

14:40.208 --> 14:42.375
Here you have the most amazing
wrinkled raisins...

14:42.410 --> 14:44.811
Cauliflower, prunes...

14:44.846 --> 14:50.350
Dried morels, tripe,
and of course, calf brains.

14:50.385 --> 14:52.585
Which do you think
is the most difficult category

14:52.621 --> 14:53.753
to cook with tonight?

14:53.788 --> 14:56.289
Is it Christina's fiery,
spicy ingredients,

14:56.324 --> 14:59.525
or Graham's pungent,
smelly ingredients,

14:59.561 --> 15:05.064
or my crinkly, wrinkly,
dehydrated ingredients?

15:05.100 --> 15:06.399
- Huddle.
- Graham's?

15:06.434 --> 15:08.468
- No, Christina's.
- Not Christina's.

15:08.503 --> 15:10.169
Now I'm in control
of this competition,

15:10.205 --> 15:12.338
and it feels amazing,

15:12.374 --> 15:14.374
but I don't want to see
any of my friends go home.

15:14.409 --> 15:15.620
Some people like
those ingredients,

15:15.644 --> 15:16.676
and some people don't.

15:16.711 --> 15:18.311
So really we won't be
hurting everybody.

15:18.346 --> 15:20.546
This is going to be
a really hard decision.

15:20.582 --> 15:22.782
Ian, what have you and your team

15:22.817 --> 15:26.252
chosen for everybody else
out there tonight to cook with?

15:26.287 --> 15:27.287
We choose...

15:31.593 --> 15:33.326
Oh, boy.

15:33.361 --> 15:34.494
- We're sunk.
- Oh, my gosh.

15:34.529 --> 15:36.496
Oh, no!

15:36.531 --> 15:37.930
There's no escape.

15:37.966 --> 15:42.535
In the pantry, Ian's team
got some huge advantages.

15:42.570 --> 15:44.737
We gave 'em the choice
of ingredients

15:44.773 --> 15:48.041
that help describe us.

15:48.076 --> 15:50.209
- Are you ready?
- Yes, Chef!

15:50.245 --> 15:53.046
Let's find out
what they've picked.

15:53.081 --> 15:54.781
- Ohh.
- Aah!

15:54.816 --> 15:55.816
Oh, boy.

15:59.187 --> 16:02.689
We got some food for you.
Yummy delights.

16:02.724 --> 16:04.524
- Oh, no.
- Oh, God.

16:06.161 --> 16:07.571
Olive Garden has two new

16:07.595 --> 16:10.096
mouth-watering
appetizers inspired by Logan,

16:10.131 --> 16:12.198
<i>MasterChef Junior</i>
season two winner.

16:12.233 --> 16:14.967
And featuring Olive Garden's
famous breadsticks.

16:15.003 --> 16:16.536
Visit your local
Olive Garden now

16:16.571 --> 16:20.073

will stay on the menu.

16:23.931 --> 16:24.897
Are you ready?

16:24.932 --> 16:26.231
Yes, Chef!

16:26.267 --> 16:28.801
Let's find out
what they've picked.

16:28.836 --> 16:30.469
- Ugh!
- Uh-oh.

16:30.504 --> 16:31.537
Oh, boy.

16:34.542 --> 16:37.509
We got some food for you.
Yummy delights.

16:37.545 --> 16:40.012
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no, oh, God.

16:40.047 --> 16:42.748
Oh, my gosh.
Does anyone at

16:42.783 --> 16:44.850
We got some stinky food for you.

16:47.855 --> 16:50.055
We chose some very stinky,

16:50.091 --> 16:52.725
but very complicated
and sophisticated food

16:52.760 --> 16:54.426
for you guys to cook with.

16:54.462 --> 16:56.995
How do you make a good-tasting
dish that's also smelly?

16:57.031 --> 16:59.131
Just how?
How do you do it?

16:59.166 --> 17:02.434
Right, you six
can watch this challenge

17:02.470 --> 17:04.369
from up on the balcony.
Head upstairs.

17:06.107 --> 17:07.673
Oh, wow.
This is tricky.

17:07.708 --> 17:09.942
I am so scared... I have no idea
what I'm going to do.

17:09.977 --> 17:11.777
Me neither.
I'm freaking out.

17:11.811 --> 17:14.079
All of you will have
just one hour

17:14.115 --> 17:15.948
and access to a limited pantry

17:15.983 --> 17:18.349
to make us
a MasterChef-quality dish

17:18.386 --> 17:20.452
featuring
these smelly ingredients

17:20.488 --> 17:22.954
like blue cheese, truffle oil,

17:22.990 --> 17:25.557
garlic, and fish sauce.

17:25.593 --> 17:27.626
- Oh, my gosh.
- Everyone ready?

17:27.661 --> 17:29.495
Yes, Chef!

17:29.530 --> 17:33.365
Your one hour starts...

17:33.401 --> 17:34.466
Yeah, let's do this.

17:34.502 --> 17:35.601
Now.

17:35.636 --> 17:36.702
Good luck!

17:40.541 --> 17:41.651
I run up to the table,

17:41.675 --> 17:43.342
and I'm thinking about

17:43.377 --> 17:47.446
adding ingredients that
I haven't really used a lot.

17:47.481 --> 17:49.415
Addison, don't take
too much rosewater.

17:49.450 --> 17:50.749
That stuff is strong.

17:50.785 --> 17:53.819
This risk
could either send me home

17:53.854 --> 17:55.621
or help me win this challenge.

17:55.656 --> 17:57.790
- Does anybody see limes?
- The asparagus.

17:58.993 --> 17:59.993
Ha!

18:03.597 --> 18:06.198
I'm making lamb
with a potato cake

18:06.233 --> 18:08.400
and red wine garlic sauce.

18:08.436 --> 18:10.702
This stinky little challenge

18:10.738 --> 18:13.539
is not going
to send me back to the bayou.

18:13.574 --> 18:14.840
What are you making, Derek?

18:14.875 --> 18:16.875
I'm making grilled steak

18:16.911 --> 18:19.244
with roasted acorn squash
and couscous.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.979
It looks really good.

18:21.015 --> 18:22.848
I am using science in this dish.

18:22.883 --> 18:24.917
I injected my meat
with the marinade

18:24.952 --> 18:27.219
to break down the fibers
within the meat

18:27.254 --> 18:29.354
to make it more tender.

18:29.390 --> 18:30.622
Ugh!

18:30.658 --> 18:32.257
Wow, what a challenge.

18:32.293 --> 18:34.004
If there's one thing
we turned our nose against

18:34.028 --> 18:36.195
when we were growing up
was smelly food.

18:36.230 --> 18:38.497
Yeah, absolutely.
I think it's a natural turnoff.

18:38.532 --> 18:40.032
What do you love
or hate in there?

18:40.067 --> 18:42.301
I love fish
sauce, so I would go down

18:42.336 --> 18:43.502
that sort of Asian route.

18:43.537 --> 18:44.770
Take some of those shrimp.

18:44.805 --> 18:46.416
Make the most amazing broth
with the fish sauce.

18:46.440 --> 18:47.851
The fresh anchovies.
The pickled eggs.

18:47.875 --> 18:50.576
Sort of create a really
nice, aromatic dish.

18:50.611 --> 18:52.945
So you would make those smelly
ingredients the star?

18:52.980 --> 18:57.049
100%. I'm hoping that we see
some really bold, amazing dishes

18:57.084 --> 18:58.528
where they have to come
out of their comfort zone

18:58.552 --> 19:01.954
and get used to
those pungent flavors.

19:01.989 --> 19:05.457
I am not a big stinky
food kind of person,

19:05.493 --> 19:07.693
but it tastes good.

19:07.728 --> 19:10.095
Come on! Speed up, guys!

19:10.130 --> 19:12.130
Right, Kya, describe the dish.
What are you making?

19:12.166 --> 19:14.633
Today I'm making
a poached chicken

19:14.668 --> 19:18.704
with a white truffle oil cream
sauce and boiled vegetables.

19:18.739 --> 19:20.105
Why are you poaching
inside a bag?

19:20.140 --> 19:22.341
Because I want to add
in more flavors.

19:22.376 --> 19:24.109
Right. Where did
you see this first?

19:24.144 --> 19:26.311
I mean, how do you come up
with these ideas at eight?

19:26.347 --> 19:28.625
Because that is something very
difficult to do, you know that?

19:28.649 --> 19:30.082
When I was little

19:30.117 --> 19:32.184
I used to watch my mom
cooking all the time.

19:32.219 --> 19:33.452
I like that.

19:33.487 --> 19:35.721
"When you were little."
When did you stop being little?

19:35.756 --> 19:36.855
I don't know.

19:36.891 --> 19:38.590
How far can you go
in this competition?

19:38.626 --> 19:39.858
Top 15? Top 10?

19:39.894 --> 19:41.527
- Probably all the way.
- All the way?

19:41.562 --> 19:42.628
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

19:44.632 --> 19:46.098
- All right, Corey.
- Hello.

19:46.133 --> 19:49.001
Tell me, are you a smelly,
funky food kind of guy?

19:49.036 --> 19:51.270
No, I'm not a smelly,
funky food kind of guy.

19:51.305 --> 19:52.549
- Not at all?
- I'm a good-smelling guy.

19:52.573 --> 19:53.839
All right.
What are you making?

19:53.874 --> 19:57.442
A farfalle pasta with
a spicy marinara sauce

19:57.478 --> 20:00.145
and a savory sausage topping.

20:00.180 --> 20:01.847
I'm adding a lot
of garlic into there,

20:01.882 --> 20:04.850
and I'm also seasoning up
the sausage with garlic.

20:04.885 --> 20:05.885
Good luck.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.186
Anchovy.

20:08.222 --> 20:09.988
- All right, Miss Addison!
- Hi.

20:10.024 --> 20:11.557
So what kind of
smelly ingredients

20:11.592 --> 20:12.891
are you cooking with tonight?

20:12.927 --> 20:15.160
I'm cooking with
fish sauce, corn nuts,

20:15.195 --> 20:16.528
and rosewater in garlic.

20:16.564 --> 20:19.798
Those are four very
different smelly ingredients.

20:19.833 --> 20:20.799
Yes.

20:20.834 --> 20:21.800
What are you making with those?

20:21.835 --> 20:23.335
It's a tom kha gai soup

20:23.370 --> 20:26.371
with jasmine rice
and chicken meatballs.

20:26.407 --> 20:28.907
So you're taking us
to Thailand, but with a twist?

20:28.943 --> 20:29.975
Yes.

20:30.010 --> 20:32.210
"Spicy" is a word
that describes me.

20:32.246 --> 20:34.413
"Wrinkly" is a word
that describes Gordon.

20:34.448 --> 20:36.114
"Smelly" describes Graham.

20:36.150 --> 20:38.350
What's a word
that describes you?

20:38.385 --> 20:40.619
- Awesome.
- Good luck.

20:40.654 --> 20:42.287
Right. Adam,
tell me about the dish.

20:42.323 --> 20:43.522
What's the dish called?

20:43.557 --> 20:46.058
It's anchovies and pasta sauce

20:46.093 --> 20:48.994
that has a base of truffle oil.

20:49.029 --> 20:50.696
- Wow.
- Served over some linguini.

20:50.731 --> 20:52.242
You sound like a man
of expensive taste.

20:52.266 --> 20:54.299
Have you worked with lots
of truffle oil before?

20:54.335 --> 20:56.401
No. Truffles aren't
really my cup of tea.

20:56.437 --> 20:58.470
11 years of age.

20:58.505 --> 21:00.216
How old were you when you
first started making pasta?

21:00.240 --> 21:01.707
- 11.
- Oh, so you just

21:01.742 --> 21:03.041
recently started this year?

21:03.077 --> 21:04.888
Is this something you do
at home in Brooklyn a lot?

21:04.912 --> 21:07.145
Uh, yeah, so this
isn't really a huge step

21:07.181 --> 21:08.280
out of my comfort zone.

21:08.315 --> 21:09.648
Good luck.

21:09.683 --> 21:12.050
Oh, my God.

21:12.086 --> 21:14.186
Whatcha making, Addison?

21:14.221 --> 21:15.454
A tom kha gai.

21:15.489 --> 21:16.822
Is it going good?

21:16.857 --> 21:19.825
Terrible, I just burnt
my whole entire soup.

21:21.629 --> 21:22.928
- All right, Nate!
- Hi there.

21:22.963 --> 21:24.963
You chose one of
the stinkiest ingredients,

21:24.999 --> 21:26.231
blue cheese.

21:26.266 --> 21:27.266
What are you making?

21:27.301 --> 21:30.769
A rosemary garlic butter steak

21:30.804 --> 21:35.073
with boiled, mashed,
fried, fingerling potatoes

21:35.109 --> 21:36.341
and asparagus.

21:36.377 --> 21:39.111
Where is that stinky,
funky blue cheese?

21:39.146 --> 21:41.146
Garnish.
I think the simplicity

21:41.181 --> 21:43.215
and the beauty
of raw blue cheese

21:43.250 --> 21:44.861
just takes the whole dish
to the next level.

21:44.885 --> 21:46.451
All right.
Good luck, Nate.

21:46.487 --> 21:49.054
All right, Jaeclyn,
what's your dish?

21:49.089 --> 21:53.225
I'm making a shrimp and
pineapple kebab

21:53.260 --> 21:56.695
with grilled corn
and lemon rice.

21:56.730 --> 22:01.400
Now tell me, smelly ingredients:
Do you love 'em?

22:01.435 --> 22:02.868
- No.
- Why not?

22:02.903 --> 22:04.336
My mom likes some,

22:04.371 --> 22:05.737
'cause she likes garlic,

22:05.773 --> 22:07.939
and that's the ingredient
I used today.

22:07.975 --> 22:09.474
Good luck.

22:09.510 --> 22:11.810
Just over 20 minutes to go.

22:14.314 --> 22:15.825
- Wow.
- Well, there's a lot

22:15.849 --> 22:17.749
of smelly things
going on out there.

22:17.785 --> 22:18.928
- Yes.
- I'll tell you what,

22:18.952 --> 22:22.287
pee-ew, but a lot of
the dishes sound amazing.

22:22.322 --> 22:24.856
Addison is doing a play
on a tom kha gai.

22:24.892 --> 22:27.092
She's making
a rosewater-scented rice

22:27.127 --> 22:29.494
which might be a little strange,

22:29.530 --> 22:31.296
but if there's anyone
that we know that knows

22:31.331 --> 22:34.533
how to really wrangle flavor
and wow us, it's Addison.

22:34.568 --> 22:35.967
Right, brace yourselves.

22:36.003 --> 22:39.805
Kya is doing a steamed chicken
breast with broth, red wine,

22:39.840 --> 22:42.207
and truffle oil,
and mushrooms, and garlic.

22:42.242 --> 22:43.453
And she's steaming it in a bag.

22:43.477 --> 22:46.511
Eight years old.
Where you do come up with this?

22:46.547 --> 22:47.757
Really worried about Jaeclyn,

22:47.781 --> 22:49.392
'cause she kind of stays
in her comfort zone.

22:49.416 --> 22:50.549
She's doing a skewer,

22:50.584 --> 22:52.951
but to be turned off
by some of these things

22:52.986 --> 22:54.953
and not embrace it...
it's going to be, you know,

22:54.988 --> 22:56.988
working at a disadvantage
for sure.

22:57.024 --> 22:59.157
Smelly is something
that they picked,

22:59.193 --> 23:01.026
but I don't think it's the star.

23:01.061 --> 23:02.939
I'm also worried about Jaeclyn,
but I have to tell you

23:02.963 --> 23:05.063
I'm worried that Adam
might be just a little

23:05.099 --> 23:06.765
out of his element
in this challenge.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.301
He likes to cook with
those classic Italian flavors.

23:09.336 --> 23:10.802
He's frying in truffle oil.

23:10.838 --> 23:12.003
Oh.

23:12.039 --> 23:13.316
I mean, you would never do that.

23:13.340 --> 23:14.951
Never. I mean,
that'll just numb your tongue.

23:14.975 --> 23:17.476
Adam could really be
in trouble tonight.

23:17.511 --> 23:19.745
Adam, I think you need
to roll it out.

23:19.780 --> 23:21.146
I'm making the pasta,

23:21.181 --> 23:23.415
and I'm running it through
the linguini machine,

23:23.450 --> 23:26.384
and it just falls apart.

23:26.420 --> 23:29.187
Adam's fresh pasta needs
to rest at least 15 minutes

23:29.223 --> 23:30.600
before he starts putting it
through that machine.

23:30.624 --> 23:32.491
I've made pasta,
like, so many times.

23:32.526 --> 23:34.326
And, I mean,
I can't mess this up right now.

23:34.361 --> 23:35.994
Adam, you better separate that.

23:36.029 --> 23:37.095
I know what I'm doing.

23:37.131 --> 23:38.263
I've done this before.

23:38.298 --> 23:40.565
Blah, blah, blah.

23:40.601 --> 23:43.568
I'm trying to give
Adam advice about his pasta,

23:43.604 --> 23:47.973
but of course, being a boy,
he didn't listen to me.

23:48.008 --> 23:50.442
Roll it up and then cut it.

23:50.477 --> 23:51.643
Like, by hand.

23:51.678 --> 23:53.311
I did.
That's what I did.

23:53.347 --> 23:54.813
Oh, my God.

23:54.848 --> 23:56.615
Like, roll it up now.

23:56.650 --> 23:58.250
Like you roll it up, and then...

23:58.285 --> 23:59.985
You know what?
I'm done.

24:06.415 --> 24:07.781
Oh, my God.

24:07.817 --> 24:09.550
Adam could really be
in trouble tonight.

24:09.585 --> 24:12.386
Adam's fresh pasta needs
to rest at least 15 minutes

24:12.421 --> 24:13.799
before he starts putting it
through that machine.

24:13.823 --> 24:15.923
Well, my pasta
kind of got a little messed up.

24:15.958 --> 24:17.558
I don't really know how,

24:17.593 --> 24:21.228
so I just restarted and made
some home-cut fettuccine.

24:21.263 --> 24:22.974
I'm Italian, and when
I grow up I want to have

24:22.998 --> 24:25.499
my own Italian restaurant,
so I would much rather

24:25.534 --> 24:28.268
stay in the MasterChef kitchen
than go back to Brooklyn.

24:28.304 --> 24:30.671
I need more butter!

24:30.706 --> 24:31.872
Whoo!

24:31.907 --> 24:33.374
90 seconds to go, guys.

24:33.409 --> 24:36.009
90 seconds.
Okay, wow.

24:36.045 --> 24:37.845
Let's go, guys.

24:37.880 --> 24:40.581
Taste everything, guys.

24:40.616 --> 24:42.783
- 60 seconds to go!
- Come on, guys.

24:42.818 --> 24:43.784
We're down to our last minute.

24:43.819 --> 24:45.386
- Oh, my God!
- Come on, guys!

24:47.790 --> 24:49.423
Ten, nine, eight...

24:49.458 --> 24:50.791
You can do it!

24:50.826 --> 24:53.827
Seven, six, five,

24:53.863 --> 24:57.765
four, three, two, one.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.334
And stop!
Hands in the air.

25:00.369 --> 25:02.002
- Well done.
- Whoo!

25:02.037 --> 25:07.040
- It stinks in here.
- Oh, my God.

25:07.076 --> 25:12.646
Let's begin with
the smelly dish from Addison.

25:12.681 --> 25:14.648
I am definitely
feeling the pressure,

25:14.683 --> 25:17.217
because I took a big risk
on this one.

25:17.253 --> 25:20.988
I just really hope
that my four stinky ingredients

25:21.023 --> 25:24.091
help my Thai soup, not hurt it.

25:24.126 --> 25:27.027
All right, Miss Addison,
what's the dish?

25:27.062 --> 25:30.397
I made for you a tom kha gai
soup with fish sauce

25:30.433 --> 25:33.233
and garlic, chicken meatballs
which have corn nuts in it.

25:33.269 --> 25:35.636
And then you
have rosewater rice.

25:35.671 --> 25:36.937
Just hearing the dish...

25:36.972 --> 25:38.183
hearing the smelly ingredients...

25:38.207 --> 25:40.474
you took a lot of risks.

25:40.509 --> 25:42.042
Garlic and fish sauce
go together,

25:42.077 --> 25:45.145
but rosewater does not really go
with fish sauce or corn nuts.

25:45.181 --> 25:48.782
So you needed to be
a flavor technician

25:48.818 --> 25:50.717
- to make this dish work.
- Yes.

25:50.753 --> 25:53.287
Have you ever had curry
and rosewater before?

25:53.322 --> 25:55.155
I have not.

25:59.562 --> 26:01.128
Are you kidding me?

26:01.163 --> 26:02.596
That's delicious.

26:02.631 --> 26:03.897
It's fragrant.

26:03.933 --> 26:05.844
I'm getting a little bit
of that curry paste, too,

26:05.868 --> 26:09.436
which actually lends itself
really nicely to that rosewater.

26:09.472 --> 26:12.005
Thank you.

26:12.041 --> 26:13.140
Wow.

26:13.175 --> 26:15.008
It's bold, and it's flavorful,

26:15.044 --> 26:17.911
but that common theme
of that tom kha gai

26:17.947 --> 26:19.780
coconut curry soup
with a little bit

26:19.815 --> 26:21.560
of chicken, and mushrooms,
and green in there...

26:21.584 --> 26:25.085
Addison, this is
a really impressive dish.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.387
- Good job.
- Thank you.

26:33.095 --> 26:34.995
- You tasted this all together?
- Yes.

26:35.030 --> 26:36.497
And what did you think?

26:36.532 --> 26:38.098
I thought it tasted really good.

26:38.133 --> 26:40.133
Have you ever spent time
in Asia?

26:40.169 --> 26:41.235
- No, Chef.
- No.

26:41.270 --> 26:42.447
Well, it tastes like you have,

26:42.471 --> 26:44.438
'cause the depth
of flavor is incredible.

26:44.473 --> 26:45.772
I'm... I'm shocked.

26:45.808 --> 26:47.975
It is absolutely delicious.

26:48.010 --> 26:50.644
Top 16 around the corner.

26:50.679 --> 26:52.880
How far do you think you can go?

26:52.915 --> 26:54.047
I can go to the finale,

26:54.083 --> 26:55.360
and then from there
I'm going to win.

26:55.384 --> 26:57.384
Keep cooking like this,

26:57.419 --> 27:01.188
and you will be a force
to be reckoned with.

27:01.223 --> 27:03.001
You sure you haven't
got a recipe in your pocket?

27:03.025 --> 27:04.558
Turn round.

27:04.593 --> 27:05.837
Anything up your sleeve
or anything like that?

27:05.861 --> 27:06.894
No.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.662
- This all just came from there.
- Yes.

27:08.697 --> 27:10.242
Seriously? Show me
the inside of the hat.

27:10.266 --> 27:12.032
There's no recipe inside that.
Got to check.

27:12.067 --> 27:16.570
- Nothing.
- There's no... ah, there's a...

27:16.605 --> 27:18.005
Well done.
Good job.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.374
Thank you.

27:20.409 --> 27:25.245
I'm walking back to my
station feeling like a million bucks.

27:25.281 --> 27:26.980
Ba-bam!

27:27.016 --> 27:28.749
Next up, please.
Derek.

27:28.784 --> 27:31.385
Come on, Derek.

27:31.420 --> 27:32.519
Wow.
Beautiful presentation.

27:32.555 --> 27:34.321
Tell me what we have.

27:34.356 --> 27:37.624
A rib eye steak with roasted
acorn squash, Israeli couscous,

27:37.660 --> 27:41.094
and a crÃ¨me fraiche lime
and cilantro sauce.

27:41.130 --> 27:43.430
What are the smelly items
that I'm looking for?

27:43.465 --> 27:45.065
Garlic and vinegar.

27:45.100 --> 27:47.067
Now, why didn't you go
for any of the fish sauce

27:47.102 --> 27:48.235
or shrimp paste?

27:48.270 --> 27:51.038
I wanted something
which would go with the flavors

27:51.073 --> 27:53.778
of this dish
and not overpower them.

27:53.858 --> 27:56.310
Beautiful cook
on the steak... nailed that.

27:59.611 --> 28:01.478
Seasoned perfectly.
CrÃ¨me fraiche sauce.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.612
Got that beautiful acidity

28:02.647 --> 28:03.825
and some of that lime
coming through it.

28:03.849 --> 28:06.382
It tastes like a great
Derek restaurant dish.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.184
Thank you.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.286
Next up, Kya.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.622
Let's go, young lady.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.759
Right.
Describe the dish.

28:16.795 --> 28:20.997
Poached chicken with a
white truffle oil cream sauce

28:21.032 --> 28:23.333
and boiled veggies.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.608
How old were you when you first

28:24.636 --> 28:27.003
got your introduction
to truffle oil?

28:27.038 --> 28:28.872
Maybe about when I was four.

28:28.907 --> 28:30.373
Four.
So a long time ago.

28:30.408 --> 28:33.643
We usually use it
for our Thanksgiving turkey.

28:33.678 --> 28:36.279
My dad... he would make
truffle cream sauce.

28:36.314 --> 28:37.881
Wow.

28:37.916 --> 28:39.393
How long did you
cook the chicken for?

28:39.417 --> 28:42.318
I cooked the chicken
for 45 minutes.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.457
Yeah.
I mean, it's delicious.

28:47.492 --> 28:48.858
Seasoned beautifully.

28:48.894 --> 28:52.128
Truffle oil is at the back,
so it's not too strong,

28:52.164 --> 28:54.364
but next time you're going to
poach chicken,

28:54.399 --> 28:55.498
take off the skin.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.100
- Okay.
- 'Cause poached skin is,

28:57.135 --> 28:59.202
like, slightly awkward to eat.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.537
- Okay.
- However,

29:00.572 --> 29:02.372
overall,
it's really good indeed.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.507
Thank you.

29:04.543 --> 29:06.709
Next up, Avery.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.015
What did you do tonight
with smelly ingredients?

29:12.050 --> 29:16.719
What I have made is lamb
with a garlic and potato cake

29:16.755 --> 29:19.289
with a red wine
and garlic sauce.

29:19.324 --> 29:22.592
What was inspiring
about that table

29:22.627 --> 29:25.495
of stinky, smelly ingredients?

29:25.530 --> 29:27.397
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

29:27.432 --> 29:30.266
Where'd you learn
how to cook lamb chops?

29:30.302 --> 29:32.068
My mom.

29:32.103 --> 29:35.438
Your mom definitely knows what
she's doing if she taught you.

29:35.473 --> 29:37.273
Great cook.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.479
The flavor is definitely there.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.515
You did a nice job
of plating the lamb chops,

29:45.550 --> 29:46.816
but from a color standpoint

29:46.851 --> 29:49.052
it's all sort of,
like, tan and brown,

29:49.087 --> 29:51.721
and it really needs something
to brighten it up visually.

29:51.756 --> 29:53.223
The only other thing I'd say

29:53.258 --> 29:55.325
is the potatoes are
a perfect vehicle for something

29:55.360 --> 29:57.160
like a stinky cheese,
something like that.

29:57.195 --> 29:58.673
I think you could have gone
a little bit further

29:58.697 --> 30:03.099
and just embraced the smelly
funk of Graham's ingredients.

30:03.134 --> 30:04.300
Good job, Avery.

30:04.336 --> 30:05.336
Thank you, Chef.

30:07.072 --> 30:09.906
Next up, Jaeclyn, please.
Let's go.

30:11.109 --> 30:13.876
I don't usually
cook with smelly things

30:13.912 --> 30:15.511
because it's so gross,

30:15.547 --> 30:17.046
but it is really important

30:17.082 --> 30:19.682
for me to make the best smelly
dish possible tonight,

30:19.718 --> 30:21.618
because I don't want to go home.

30:21.653 --> 30:22.952
I'm not ready yet.

30:22.988 --> 30:24.520
Describe the dish, please,
my darling.

30:24.556 --> 30:27.156
This is a shrimp
and pineapple kabob

30:27.192 --> 30:31.094
with a lime rice and corn salad.

30:31.129 --> 30:33.040
What was the smelly ingredient
that you used in tonight's dish?

30:33.064 --> 30:34.464
I used garlic.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.033
How did you marinate the shrimp?

30:37.068 --> 30:41.404
I used smoked
paprika and cayenne...

30:41.439 --> 30:43.139
- Nice.
- And olive oil.

30:43.174 --> 30:46.976
And the smelly ingredients
are just the garlic, right?

30:47.012 --> 30:49.112
- Just the garlic.
- And how did you cook these?

30:49.147 --> 30:50.380
On the...

30:50.415 --> 30:54.350
- On the grill.
- On the grill plate, yes.

30:54.386 --> 30:57.020
See that prawn there?
Just touch that on top there.

30:57.055 --> 30:59.422
- Yeah.
- It's really soft.

31:02.093 --> 31:05.094
Are you confident
that it's cooked in the middle?

31:05.130 --> 31:06.130
Damn.

31:18.952 --> 31:21.552
See that prawn there?
Just touch that on top there.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.921
- Yeah.
- It's really soft.

31:26.392 --> 31:29.360
Are you confident
that it's cooked in the middle?

31:29.395 --> 31:31.763
Damn.

31:31.798 --> 31:36.400
Unfortunately, my shrimp
is raw that side,

31:36.436 --> 31:37.902
so I'm not going to eat that.

31:37.937 --> 31:39.014
When you make a kebab,
everything has to be

31:39.038 --> 31:40.538
the same size
so it cooks evenly.

31:40.573 --> 31:41.906
- Yes.
- The problem is,

31:41.941 --> 31:45.543
you've tucked them in between
big chunks of pineapple,

31:45.578 --> 31:47.712
and that's a shame,
'cause that's the woody part.

31:47.747 --> 31:49.058
You know when
you get pineapple rings

31:49.082 --> 31:52.483
that's why they take out
that core, which is solid.

31:52.519 --> 31:53.851
Love what you did with the rice.

31:53.887 --> 31:55.731
- How'd you get it that color?
- The chicken stock,

31:55.755 --> 31:59.090
and I also put lime zest
and lime juice in it.

31:59.125 --> 32:02.093
So the rice is nice.
Okay, love that.

32:02.128 --> 32:03.628
This could have
been a good dish.

32:03.663 --> 32:05.341
Unfortunately there's
some technical errors.

32:05.365 --> 32:06.809
You've served the core
of the pineapple.

32:06.833 --> 32:08.633
The shrimp are raw,

32:08.668 --> 32:11.035
and it's not very garlicky,
'cause everything's very sweet.

32:11.070 --> 32:12.904
Needs more smelly ingredients.

32:12.939 --> 32:14.172
Don't be scared of them.

32:14.207 --> 32:15.740
Thank you.

32:15.775 --> 32:18.109
I'm feeling really disappointed,

32:18.144 --> 32:20.044
because I really
don't think I did enough.

32:20.079 --> 32:21.345
Like, it felt really good

32:21.381 --> 32:23.815
last time
to be safe from elimination,

32:23.850 --> 32:27.718
but I don't know if I'm going
to have the same luck this time.

32:27.754 --> 32:29.020
Next up.

32:29.055 --> 32:32.824
The smelly dish from Corey.

32:32.859 --> 32:35.827
I'm feeling pretty confident
about my dish.

32:35.862 --> 32:39.931
The smelly ingredients
add extra oomph to it.

32:39.966 --> 32:42.867
Corey, please tell me
what you've made.

32:42.902 --> 32:44.602
Well, I made a farfalle pasta

32:44.637 --> 32:47.772
with a turkey sausage
and marinara sauce.

32:47.807 --> 32:51.943
The marinara sauce contains
garlic and pickled eggs.

32:51.978 --> 32:56.647
What about pickled
eggs screamed out, "Corey!

32:56.683 --> 32:58.649
Farfalle!
Pasta sauce?"

32:58.685 --> 33:00.751
The fact that
it's soaked in vinegar,

33:00.787 --> 33:02.086
and vinegar is salty.

33:02.121 --> 33:04.488
I don't want to add
too much salt into my sauce,

33:04.524 --> 33:08.025
so I think I'd use something
stinky that I can make use of.

33:08.061 --> 33:09.371
I don't see any slices of them

33:09.395 --> 33:11.696
which tells me that you probably
hid them in somewhere.

33:11.731 --> 33:13.865
Well, I blended up
the pickled eggs,

33:13.900 --> 33:15.933
and then I put the blended-up
pickled eggs

33:15.969 --> 33:17.768
into the tomato sauce
and mixed it all up.

33:17.804 --> 33:18.769
Okay.

33:18.805 --> 33:20.972
And farfalle pasta from scratch.

33:21.007 --> 33:22.284
- Are you kidding me?
- Yes, from scratch.

33:22.308 --> 33:24.242
That's very impressive.

33:29.015 --> 33:31.582
The fact that you made
farfalle pasta from scratch

33:31.618 --> 33:33.184
shows a lot of skill
and technique.

33:33.219 --> 33:36.520
I just don't know that for me
it screams "smelly ingredients."

33:36.556 --> 33:38.456
For me, I would have
loved to see you take

33:38.491 --> 33:40.157
just a little bit more of a risk

33:40.193 --> 33:41.626
and be a little bit more bold

33:41.661 --> 33:44.161
with something a little
smellier and potent.

33:44.197 --> 33:45.930
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:45.965 --> 33:49.300
Next up, Philly boy Nate.

33:49.335 --> 33:50.835
I put Philly on a plate.

33:50.870 --> 33:52.136
Steak and cheese.

33:52.171 --> 33:53.671
It's a Philly classic.

33:53.706 --> 33:55.740
I mean, I put my own spin on it,

33:55.775 --> 33:59.243
and I just hope
I did my city proud.

33:59.279 --> 34:00.778
- Thank you.
- S'up, Gordon?

34:00.813 --> 34:02.179
Oh, excuse me.

34:02.215 --> 34:03.347
Boom.
Sorry.

34:03.383 --> 34:05.583
What's up?

34:05.618 --> 34:07.485
Describe the dish, please.

34:07.520 --> 34:11.188
Today I have for you
a rosemary garlic rib eye

34:11.224 --> 34:15.393
with boiled, mashed,
fried potatoes, asparagus,

34:15.428 --> 34:17.161
deglazed red wine mushrooms,

34:17.196 --> 34:19.163
and blue cheese.

34:19.197 --> 34:22.333
Wow. How many stinky
ingredients did you use?

34:22.368 --> 34:24.647
I got two stinky ingredients:
The blue cheese and the garlic.

34:24.670 --> 34:26.070
Why blue cheese?

34:26.105 --> 34:27.938
I think it just
highlights the dish.

34:27.974 --> 34:29.051
Yeah, I think you're right.

34:29.074 --> 34:30.875
I love the idea
of the sort of boiled,

34:30.909 --> 34:32.043
roasted, smashed potatoes

34:32.078 --> 34:33.489
with the blue cheese...
visually it looks great.

34:33.513 --> 34:35.478
What's the seasoning
on the steak?

34:35.514 --> 34:40.518
It's salt, pepper,
crushed garlic, and rosemary.

34:42.188 --> 34:43.955
You like?
You no like?

34:43.989 --> 34:46.157
Nate, I don't like it.

34:48.161 --> 34:49.460
I absolutely love it.

34:49.495 --> 34:50.661
It is delicious.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.096
Cook on the steak is beautiful,

34:52.130 --> 34:54.243
and the nice thing about
that blue cheese incorporation

34:54.266 --> 34:55.511
is that you've managed
the seasoning

34:55.534 --> 34:57.335
on all the other ingredients,
'cause sometimes

34:57.370 --> 34:59.904
when you add salt on salt
it gets way, way too salty.

34:59.939 --> 35:02.173
But the actual cheese
lifts everything

35:02.208 --> 35:05.977
to a completely different level,
so good job.

35:06.012 --> 35:07.478
- Thanks.
- Well done.

35:11.050 --> 35:12.161
You got mushrooms in here, too?

35:12.185 --> 35:13.551
- Yeah.
- "Yeah."

35:13.586 --> 35:15.586
What are you, a tough guy now?

35:15.621 --> 35:17.955
Show off the guns.
Be careful.

35:19.859 --> 35:21.092
Seasoning's amazing.

35:21.127 --> 35:22.393
The cook on the steak is great.

35:22.428 --> 35:23.794
Color on the asparagus.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.029
Love the potatoes.

35:25.064 --> 35:26.931
I guess the only thing
I would say is

35:26.966 --> 35:28.432
see if you could get
a smaller plate

35:28.468 --> 35:30.534
and put more stuff on it.

35:30.570 --> 35:32.103
Look at that.
Come on, right?

35:32.138 --> 35:33.604
Next time... a little larger.

35:33.639 --> 35:34.839
Work on the presentation,

35:34.874 --> 35:37.141
but the flavor, most
importantly, is there,

35:37.176 --> 35:41.979
and you captured the essence
of that smelly challenge.

35:42.015 --> 35:43.447
- Good job.
- Thanks.

35:43.483 --> 35:45.349
I cut the cheese.

35:45.385 --> 35:47.685
Right.
Last up, Adam.

35:49.122 --> 35:50.521
I'm really nervous,

35:50.556 --> 35:54.325
because my dish did not come out
as good as I wanted it to be,

35:54.360 --> 35:56.027
but I mean the smell
coming from my dish

35:56.062 --> 35:57.072
is, like, through the roof.

35:57.096 --> 35:58.173
They wanted a stinky plate.

35:58.197 --> 35:59.563
I gave 'em a stinky plate.

35:59.599 --> 36:01.165
Describe the dish, please.

36:01.200 --> 36:05.403
Well, it is hand-cut pasta
topped with an anchovy sauce

36:05.438 --> 36:07.838
and garnished
with some rosemary.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.540
I made the pasta from scratch.

36:09.575 --> 36:11.042
Cut the pasta kind of thick

36:11.077 --> 36:12.810
so that it can soak up
some of my sauce

36:12.845 --> 36:15.679
which has anchovies,
truffle oil, and garlic in it.

36:15.715 --> 36:17.314
Why anchovies and truffle oil?

36:17.350 --> 36:19.617
I wanted to make something
Italian, and the truffle oil

36:19.652 --> 36:21.752
is made in Italy...
It's got the olive oil.

36:21.788 --> 36:25.089
The anchovies are generally
regarded as an Italian thing,

36:25.124 --> 36:27.224
so I really thought
that that could bring, like,

36:27.260 --> 36:30.161
a good flavor
of saltiness to the dish.

36:30.196 --> 36:32.029
And how long did you
cook this pasta for?

36:32.065 --> 36:33.130
Seven minutes or so.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.698
I didn't really time it.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.200
And did you taste this?

36:36.235 --> 36:37.802
Yeah.
I tasted the sauce.

36:37.837 --> 36:39.937
Have another little dig.

36:44.143 --> 36:46.077
You tell me.
What do you taste there?

36:50.313 --> 36:52.158
<i>MasterChef Junior</i>
is coming to a city near you,

36:52.182 --> 36:54.215
and we're looking
for great young home cooks.

36:54.250 --> 36:57.585
Next up, we're heading
to Chicago and Los Angeles,

36:57.620 --> 37:00.121
New York City and Atlanta.

37:00.156 --> 37:02.190
Go to fox.com/masterchefjunior

37:02.225 --> 37:04.692
and apply for
our next season now.

37:07.569 --> 37:09.069
And did you taste this?

37:09.104 --> 37:10.637
Yeah, I tasted the sauce.

37:10.672 --> 37:12.706
Mm-hmm.
Have another little dig.

37:16.211 --> 37:18.678
You tell me.
What do you taste there?

37:23.051 --> 37:24.684
The pasta's really thick.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.486
The sauce is kind of salty,

37:26.521 --> 37:28.455
but there's a lot of flavor.

37:28.490 --> 37:30.256
It's so pungent
with the truffle oil,

37:30.292 --> 37:31.970
and then you got the saltiness
from the anchovies,

37:31.994 --> 37:34.894
so when using truffle oil
you never cook in it.

37:34.930 --> 37:36.796
- Oh.
- You finish things off in it.

37:36.832 --> 37:39.699
You made a big mistake tonight.
You made the pasta by hand,

37:39.735 --> 37:42.335
and then you worked with it
literally seconds later.

37:42.371 --> 37:44.738
And what does pasta need to do?

37:44.773 --> 37:46.306
It's like you
before you go to school.

37:46.341 --> 37:47.819
What do you need
to do the night before?

37:47.843 --> 37:48.875
- Rest.
- Rest.

37:48.910 --> 37:50.377
Thank you.

37:50.412 --> 37:52.212
I'm Italian.
I've made pasta before,

37:52.247 --> 37:54.280
and of course, of all the times
to screw it up,

37:54.316 --> 37:55.348
it had to be now,

37:55.384 --> 37:57.584
but I put three smelly things
in it:

37:57.619 --> 38:00.653
The truffle oil, the garlic,
and the anchovies,

38:00.689 --> 38:04.357
so I'm hoping that the
creativity carries me through.

38:04.393 --> 38:06.926
Up there on the balcony,
please make your way down,

38:06.962 --> 38:09.462
and return to your stations,
thank you.

38:09.498 --> 38:10.930
Let's go.

38:10.966 --> 38:13.466
Guys, please, pick it up.

38:13.502 --> 38:15.342
As you know,
this is a competition,

38:15.370 --> 38:19.606
and now it's up to us to make
some very difficult choices.

38:19.641 --> 38:22.742
We need a moment
to discuss everybody's dish.

38:26.415 --> 38:29.249
So the disappointing ones
tonight: Jaeclyn.

38:29.284 --> 38:30.717
The core of the pineapple.

38:30.752 --> 38:32.018
Shrimp undercooked.

38:32.054 --> 38:33.686
I mean, underwhelming.
And Corey's...

38:33.722 --> 38:35.355
That poor pasta sauce.

38:35.390 --> 38:36.901
I mean, with those eggs...
you don't cook with those eggs.

38:36.925 --> 38:38.136
You finish dishes
with those eggs.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.293
Avery's lamb was nice,

38:40.328 --> 38:42.028
but visually didn't really work.

38:42.064 --> 38:43.930
Yeah.
I mean for me, Adam.

38:43.965 --> 38:45.465
He made fresh pasta.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.133
It was undercooked.

38:47.169 --> 38:50.470
It was way too big,
and that sauce just reeked.

38:50.505 --> 38:51.805
Anchovy and truffle oil.

38:51.840 --> 38:54.274
However, some
serious strong highlights.

38:54.309 --> 38:55.341
Addison, incredible.

38:55.377 --> 38:56.843
Four stinky ingredients

38:56.878 --> 38:58.078
that came off well.

38:58.113 --> 38:59.113
So, so impressive.

38:59.147 --> 39:00.447
Nate's was very strong.

39:00.482 --> 39:01.893
- Yeah.
- Lots of garlic.

39:01.917 --> 39:03.628
Lots of blue cheese, and just
what he did with the potatoes...

39:03.652 --> 39:05.919
cooked 'em three ways.
It looked incredible. Happy?

39:05.954 --> 39:07.854
- Yep.
- Agreed?

39:07.889 --> 39:10.023
Oh, my God.

39:10.058 --> 39:12.292
You all did an amazing job
tonight,

39:12.327 --> 39:16.663
but there were two dishes for us
that really stood out.

39:16.698 --> 39:20.400
The first of those dishes
belongs to Nate.

39:20.435 --> 39:23.103
Whoo!

39:23.138 --> 39:27.640
But the winning dish of
the night belongs to Addison.

39:33.748 --> 39:37.183
To find America's
next MasterChef Junior,

39:37.219 --> 39:38.485
we have to say good-bye

39:38.520 --> 39:40.720
to some very,
very talented young home cooks.

39:40.755 --> 39:44.023
Please, would
the following three home cooks

39:44.059 --> 39:47.460
come down and line up front?

39:47.496 --> 39:52.499
Corey.

39:52.534 --> 39:55.335
Jaeclyn.

39:59.241 --> 40:02.842
And finally,
please step forward,

40:02.878 --> 40:04.878
Adam.

40:10.785 --> 40:13.153
Tonight your three dishes

40:13.188 --> 40:15.889
just fell a little bit
short of everybody else's,

40:15.924 --> 40:18.825
but no matter
what happens tonight,

40:18.860 --> 40:23.229
you guys need to be so proud
of your journey in the kitchen.

40:23.265 --> 40:25.532
It's okay.

40:25.567 --> 40:29.269
Tonight we do have to
say good-bye to two of you.

40:29.304 --> 40:32.372
One of you has done
just enough to stay here

40:32.407 --> 40:35.041
and will return
to their station.

40:35.076 --> 40:37.021
I'm standing up there
with Corey and Jaeclyn.

40:37.045 --> 40:38.289
I mean, we're all great friends,

40:38.313 --> 40:39.991
so I mean I don't want
any of us to go home,

40:40.015 --> 40:41.748
but two of us are.

40:41.783 --> 40:44.083
The odds are not in my favor,

40:44.119 --> 40:46.719
but hopefully the judges are.

40:46.755 --> 40:48.821
Please go back
to your station...

40:54.863 --> 40:57.230
Corey.

40:59.234 --> 41:00.800
I just barely squeaked by,

41:00.835 --> 41:03.002
and so I'm a bit shaken
right now.

41:03.038 --> 41:05.004
I don't want my family
to be disappointed.

41:05.040 --> 41:08.308
I want to win
the MasterChef trophy.

41:11.413 --> 41:13.546
Jaeclyn, it's okay.

41:13.582 --> 41:15.682
That means Jaeclyn and Adam,

41:15.717 --> 41:18.718
unfortunately we have to say
good-bye

41:18.753 --> 41:19.886
to you both this evening.

41:19.921 --> 41:21.621
Listen,
you two have been brilliant.

41:21.656 --> 41:24.924
Every time you cook,
put those aprons on,

41:24.960 --> 41:27.927
and think back
to what you achieved.

41:27.963 --> 41:30.330
Jaeclyn, my darling, great job.

41:30.365 --> 41:31.664
Keep that head up high.

41:31.700 --> 41:33.366
Adam, you've been brilliant.

41:33.401 --> 41:35.068
- Well done.
- Thank you.

41:35.103 --> 41:37.070
When I was your age
I don't even know

41:37.105 --> 41:40.073
that I was allowed to pour
myself my own bowl of cereal,

41:40.108 --> 41:41.608
just to put things in context,

41:41.643 --> 41:43.443
of how bright your futures are.

41:43.478 --> 41:45.044
I still make my mom
do that for me.

41:45.080 --> 41:47.380
You still make your mom...

41:47.415 --> 41:50.950
Everyone, please give these two
a huge round of applause,

41:50.986 --> 41:52.852
and come around,
and say good-bye.

41:52.887 --> 41:53.887
Well done, guys.

41:53.922 --> 41:56.189
Thank you, Jaeclyn.
Thank you, Adam.

41:56.224 --> 41:58.625
I'm really disappointed
that I'm going home,

41:58.660 --> 42:01.361
<i>but it's been
such a great experience.</i>

42:01.396 --> 42:05.131
I beat thousands and thousands
of kids just to get here.

42:05.166 --> 42:06.966
I'm super proud about that.

42:07.002 --> 42:08.613
Okay, okay, okay, Tae-Ho,
Tae-Ho, Tae-Ho, I'm cool.

42:08.637 --> 42:10.136
Thank you.

42:10.171 --> 42:11.771
I came to <i> MasterChef Junior</i>

42:11.806 --> 42:14.107
to show the world
that, I mean, I can cook.

42:14.142 --> 42:15.842
And even though I didn't win,

42:15.877 --> 42:17.477
I'm going to go back
to Brooklyn,

42:17.512 --> 42:18.923
and I'm going
to practice making pasta.

42:18.947 --> 42:20.380
Bye, guys.
My food dream

42:20.415 --> 42:22.615
of opening an Italian restaurant
is still my food dream,

42:22.651 --> 42:24.217
and I'm still going to do it.

42:24.252 --> 42:25.785
- We love you!
- Bye.

42:25.820 --> 42:28.254
Bye!

42:28.290 --> 42:29.255
Next week...

42:29.291 --> 42:30.690
Hold on, guys!

42:30.725 --> 42:33.326
Oh, my God!

42:33.361 --> 42:35.695
- This is awesome.
- Go, go, go!

42:35.730 --> 42:38.131
The top 16 face
their first team challenge.

42:38.166 --> 42:39.632
Let's go!

42:39.668 --> 42:40.711
Cooking in
the biggest celebration

42:40.735 --> 42:42.435
in <i> MasterChef Junior</i> history.

42:42.470 --> 42:44.804
This is kids
cooking for a lot of kids.

42:44.839 --> 42:46.350
I don't know if we can do this.

42:46.374 --> 42:47.874
I feel like I'm going to faint.

42:47.909 --> 42:50.443
Will the pint-sized
chefs rise to the occasion?

42:50.478 --> 42:51.956
These wings are burned.

42:51.980 --> 42:53.279
Or will the party...

42:53.315 --> 42:55.481
- That is raw fish.
- Come to an end?

42:55.517 --> 42:57.684
They could be throwing up
and in the hospital.
