WEBVTT

00:09.200 --> 00:12.767
- Another day, another evil
deed to impress Dark Mayhem.

00:14.567 --> 00:17.500
- Oh!

00:17.600 --> 00:20.967
- I love the sound of pain
in the morning.

00:21.067 --> 00:22.633
- Oh, hey, Max.

00:22.733 --> 00:24.100
Writing in your diary?

00:24.200 --> 00:26.600
- It's not a diary.
It's a chronicle.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.900
- Yes.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.833
- Do you write
your dark secrets in it?

00:30.933 --> 00:32.300
- Yes.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.467
- CHERRY & PHOEBE:
* Diary

00:38.333 --> 00:40.633
- Oh, sorry, we're just gonna
need you to steer clear

00:40.733 --> 00:42.500
of the endangered
stink plant.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.667
- Oh, is that just like
a clever name or--

00:44.767 --> 00:47.367
No. That stinks.

00:47.467 --> 00:49.833
- It smells because
it's about to bloom.

00:49.933 --> 00:51.233
- You know, I really
do admire all the work

00:51.333 --> 00:53.000
you and the Green Teens
are doing, Allison.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.333
- Well, you two
should join us.

00:54.433 --> 00:56.033
I mean, you can't
imagine the rush

00:56.133 --> 00:59.067
of being a hero
and saving the Earth.

00:59.167 --> 01:03.267
- That's almost
impossible to imagine.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.667
- Why is this stupid fence

01:04.767 --> 01:06.533
blocking the way
to my office?

01:06.633 --> 01:09.600
- This is a PPZ--
Plant Protection Zone.

01:09.700 --> 01:14.133
You're gonna have to GTWS--
Go Through Wood Shop.

01:15.967 --> 01:18.467
Those kids have moustaches
and sharp tools.

01:18.567 --> 01:22.733
And what idiot gave you
permission to do this?

01:22.833 --> 01:25.133
"Principal Brad--"

01:25.233 --> 01:27.167
I've gotta start
paying attention

01:27.267 --> 01:30.800
to things a little bit--

01:30.900 --> 01:33.367
- Ha. Two for two, baby.

01:33.467 --> 01:36.067
- Thunderman,
I know this was you!

01:36.133 --> 01:39.133
I am tired of you
and your diary.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.467
You're never getting
this back.

01:40.567 --> 01:41.967
- You can't take tha--

01:42.067 --> 01:43.933
- Oh!

01:44.067 --> 01:46.567
- I love the sound of pain
in the morning.

01:48.433 --> 01:52.833
- *

01:52.933 --> 01:54.067
* What you see

01:54.167 --> 01:55.500
* Is not what you get

01:55.600 --> 01:58.833
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

01:58.933 --> 02:00.667
* We fit right in

02:00.767 --> 02:02.167
* Bet you never guessed

02:02.267 --> 02:03.667
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:03.767 --> 02:05.267
* Just like all the rest

02:05.367 --> 02:06.900
* A picture
perfect family *

02:07.067 --> 02:09.100
* Is what we try to be

02:09.200 --> 02:10.300
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:10.400 --> 02:11.933
* The crazy things we do

02:12.067 --> 02:13.833
* This isn't
make believe *

02:13.933 --> 02:15.400
* It's our reality

02:15.500 --> 02:16.800
* Just your average family

02:16.900 --> 02:20.067
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:20.167 --> 02:23.733
* Livin' a double life

02:27.067 --> 02:29.400
- *

02:29.500 --> 02:31.600
- Oh, Max, did you
hear the awful news?

02:31.700 --> 02:34.467
I know. It's terrible.

02:34.567 --> 02:36.667
- Seriously, Bradford was so
annoyed by that stink plant,

02:36.767 --> 02:39.433
he's gonna rip it out so he
has a place to play golf.

02:39.533 --> 02:40.933
- So we joined
the Green Teens--

02:41.067 --> 02:42.500
mainly because we care,

02:42.600 --> 02:46.733
but mostly because it
came with this free t-shirt.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.433
- They're made from the recycled
waste of elephants.

02:50.533 --> 02:53.800
- So, you guys are wearin'
poop-shirts.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.400
- And you could, too,

02:55.500 --> 02:57.333
if you signed up
like your sister, Max.

02:57.433 --> 03:01.267
What are you--like
a child's size medium?

03:01.367 --> 03:03.467
- I'm a woman's "husky."

03:06.900 --> 03:08.767
Phoebe, would you explain to
your odd little friend here

03:08.867 --> 03:10.900
how the whole Max/Phoebe
twin thing works?

03:11.067 --> 03:13.533
- Yeah, so, um, I tell Max
something I care about

03:13.633 --> 03:16.100
and ask for his help
and then he does something--

03:16.200 --> 03:18.800
like that.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.833
And then I do something--

03:20.933 --> 03:22.367
like that.

03:22.467 --> 03:24.367
Although I'm sure it'd
be a lot easier

03:24.467 --> 03:26.533
if he just supported
me for once.

03:32.067 --> 03:34.400
- Colosso, I told you
not to call me at school.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.933
You know I take
my education seriously.

03:42.467 --> 03:44.200
- But, for real,
don't call me here again.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.133
- COLOSSO: Don't hang up!

03:46.233 --> 03:49.067
Dark Mayhem wants to have your
first chronicle review tomorrow.

03:49.133 --> 03:50.600
- Oh, that's terrible.

03:50.700 --> 03:54.700
- I know. We're gonna have to
cancel our Bunny 'n Me class.

03:54.800 --> 03:59.133
- No. Bradford took my chronicle
and locked it in his office.

03:59.233 --> 04:01.467
Steal it back.

04:01.567 --> 04:05.967
- I tried, but...there
was a tiny hiccup.

04:08.067 --> 04:13.067
*

04:14.700 --> 04:16.233
- PRINCIPAL BRADFORD's VOICE:
Max Thunderman...

04:16.333 --> 04:19.167
back away from
the office door, you loser.

04:21.067 --> 04:23.667
- COLOSSO: If you have nothing
to show Dark Mayhem,

04:23.767 --> 04:24.933
you're done.

04:25.067 --> 04:29.233
You'll have to really take
your education seriously.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.067
- Ahhhh!

04:32.800 --> 04:35.967
- But, for real, I need to find
a way past the security system.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.767
- Hmmm...let me see...

04:37.867 --> 04:40.533
Ooh, there's a group
called the Green Teens

04:40.633 --> 04:44.067
that waters the plants at school
and has keys to every room--

04:44.133 --> 04:45.733
including Bradford's office.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.800
- I think I know
what I have to do.

04:49.433 --> 04:51.333
You never tell me
about your day.

04:55.133 --> 04:56.467
- Hank, I knew you
had the skills

04:56.567 --> 04:58.133
to clean the gutters
by yourself.

04:58.233 --> 04:59.500
- That's right, honey.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.433
I'm just as good at
cleaning up this house

05:01.533 --> 05:03.300
as I was at cleaning up crime.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.533
- That'll be
tomorrow's project.

05:10.633 --> 05:12.467
- Mom, Dad, check it out.

05:12.567 --> 05:14.833
Billy made me this
cool wizard's hat.

05:14.933 --> 05:19.100
- And Nora made me this
black pizza-box hat.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.267
- It's a graduation cap, Billy.

05:22.367 --> 05:23.700
Remember this image.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.533
It might be the last
time you see it.

05:28.367 --> 05:30.067
- I'm glad you two
are having fun,

05:30.167 --> 05:32.100
but I hope you didn't forget to
put the scissors away again.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.700
- Yeah, we have to be careful.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.533
Chloe can teleport
into any room--

05:35.633 --> 05:40.367
which is why we've been using
the bathroom at the library.

05:40.467 --> 05:42.533
- Don't worry.
We put the scissors away.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.500
- Yeah, we're not completely
irresponsible.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.567
- Good. Now if
you'll excuse us,

05:46.667 --> 05:50.167
we have some overdue
books to return.

05:51.567 --> 05:53.300
- I didn't put
the scissors away. Did you?

05:53.400 --> 05:54.767
- I never do.

05:54.867 --> 05:57.067
- CHLOE:
* Found the scissors

06:02.133 --> 06:04.067
- I got a haircut.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.067
- Oh, no, if Mom
and Dad see that,

06:08.100 --> 06:10.667
we're gonna be toast.

06:10.767 --> 06:12.867
- I know how to fix this.

06:15.067 --> 06:18.467
Bowl cut. Bam!

06:18.567 --> 06:21.133
- You don't deserve
to wear that hat.

06:23.167 --> 06:25.867
- *

06:25.967 --> 06:27.600
- Now the putting green
has to have

06:27.700 --> 06:29.867
freshly-cut Bermuda grass.

06:29.967 --> 06:32.300
- Uh, we're trying
to have a meeting here.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.067
- Have some respect, Phoebe.

06:34.167 --> 06:36.300
This putting green
is for our golf team.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.467
- We don't have a golf team.

06:38.567 --> 06:40.767
"We don't have a golf team."

06:40.867 --> 06:42.233
Nah.

06:42.333 --> 06:45.200
So, let's talk water hazards.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.500
- He cannot get away
with this.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.967
What's our plan
to defeat him?

06:50.067 --> 06:51.567
- The elephant
who made these shirts

06:51.667 --> 06:53.533
is going to stampede
through the school.

06:53.633 --> 06:55.633
No school. No Bradford.

06:55.733 --> 06:58.233
The stink plant lives!

06:58.333 --> 07:00.200
- No, we can't destroy
the school.

07:00.300 --> 07:04.367
"No,
we can't destroy the school."

07:04.467 --> 07:06.800
Sorry, I just like
when Bradford does that.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.067
- So, I'm guessing
we have nothing.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.233
- You have me.

07:11.333 --> 07:15.733
I present page 50, chapter 9,
line 3 of the student handbook.

07:15.833 --> 07:19.833
- Oh, Allison, this is where Max
pretends to do something nice.

07:19.933 --> 07:22.333
"A student group may reject
the principal's plan

07:22.433 --> 07:25.767
if a petition is signed by
two-thirds of the student body."

07:25.867 --> 07:28.767
- And then I do
something like this...

07:28.867 --> 07:31.267
Wait, that was a good plan.
- Yeah, it's good.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.533
And I already drew up
a petition

07:33.633 --> 07:37.500
on recycled dolphin-
dirtied paper.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.933
- Max, why are you
doing this?

07:40.067 --> 07:42.633
- Okay, I know you don't think
I have a heart, but I do.

07:42.733 --> 07:44.900
It's small, but it's there.

07:45.067 --> 07:46.800
And when you said
I don't support you,

07:46.900 --> 07:48.800
my little baby heart broke.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.800
- That's really
what you're goin' with?

07:50.900 --> 07:52.833
- I don't blame you
for being skeptical,

07:52.933 --> 07:56.133
but I just really wanna
help you take down Bradford.

07:56.233 --> 07:57.900
- Okay, that, I believe.

07:58.067 --> 08:00.067
All right, fine,
you can help us.

08:00.133 --> 08:03.067
Not because I trust you,
but we're desperate.

08:03.167 --> 08:06.133
- Good news.
The elephant is available.

08:08.367 --> 08:11.133
- Very desperate.

08:11.233 --> 08:15.200
Okay, guys, um...
Max is joining the Green Teens.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.733
- So, do I get keys to
every room in the school

08:17.833 --> 08:20.533
now that I'm a Green Teen?

08:20.633 --> 08:22.333
- Uh, I ran outta keys.

08:22.433 --> 08:23.867
- Oh, man!

08:23.967 --> 08:27.433
Uh, I just really wanna
water the plants.

08:27.533 --> 08:31.067
- *

08:31.167 --> 08:33.533
- Well, tape didn't work,
glue didn't work.

08:33.633 --> 08:36.067
How are we gonna put
this back on her head?

08:36.100 --> 08:40.067
- Give me that!

08:40.133 --> 08:41.667
Mom and Dad are
gonna be so mad

08:41.767 --> 08:43.433
that we changed
our cute baby sister

08:43.533 --> 08:46.333
into a teleporting,
nubby-haired freak!

08:46.433 --> 08:49.067
- This is what we get
for leaving the scissors out.

08:49.133 --> 08:51.333
By the way, I don't think
we ever put them away.

08:51.433 --> 08:53.833
We've gotta find them
before Chloe gets them.

08:53.933 --> 08:58.900
- I got another haircut.

08:59.067 --> 09:00.900
- BILLY & NORA:
Ahhhhhh!

09:01.067 --> 09:02.767
- BARB: Everything
okay, kids?

09:02.867 --> 09:05.933
- They're coming!
Double snuggle.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.800
- We heard yelling.
What happened?

09:07.900 --> 09:10.300
- Nothing. Just snuggling
with my sisters.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.100
We're tight, yo.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.933
- Two haircuts.

09:15.067 --> 09:17.833
- Tighter than
two haircuts, son!

09:17.933 --> 09:19.867
That's what the kids
are saying these days.

09:19.967 --> 09:22.067
- Oh, yeah, we know.
We're cool.

09:22.133 --> 09:24.833
- Yeah, cooler than
two haircuts, son!

09:28.833 --> 09:30.767
- That was close--

09:30.867 --> 09:32.767
and embarrassing
for all involved.

09:32.867 --> 09:35.233
There's got to be another
way to cover her head.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.200
We're the only people
we know who make hats

09:37.300 --> 09:40.800
and I just stapled myself
to the cabinet.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.500
- It's amazing that we got all
those signatures, Max.

09:47.600 --> 09:48.700
- Now we just have
to make back-ups

09:48.800 --> 09:50.767
in case Bradford tears up
all our hard work.

09:50.867 --> 09:52.567
Just look at what he did
to my application

09:52.667 --> 09:55.400
for an after-school
explosives camp.

10:01.733 --> 10:04.167
- My...shoelace is untied.

10:04.267 --> 10:07.867
Why don't you go ahead
and get the door?

10:07.967 --> 10:10.267
- Yes!

10:10.367 --> 10:13.233
* A perfect double knot

10:16.100 --> 10:21.700
- *

10:21.800 --> 10:24.800
- Uh, Phoebe, do you mind
making the copies?

10:24.900 --> 10:26.633
I have a leg cramp.

10:26.733 --> 10:28.400
My body's rejecting me
doing good deeds.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.867
- Yeah, it's probably
in shock like the rest of us.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.267
I think I owe you
an apology.

10:48.833 --> 10:50.867
- Yeah. You see,
I have a heart, too--

10:50.967 --> 10:52.700
only mine's like
normal sized.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.600
And it's used to
getting hurt by you,

10:54.700 --> 10:56.267
so, when you asked
to help me,

10:56.367 --> 10:58.667
I figured you were
up to something, you know?

11:02.333 --> 11:04.733
- I'm listening.

11:04.833 --> 11:07.433
- But, I guess I was wrong.

11:07.533 --> 11:09.233
You really do
have my back.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.567
And it feels good.

11:10.667 --> 11:13.567
- Havin' it back
feels great.

11:13.667 --> 11:17.067
- Sure. Sure.

11:23.467 --> 11:26.533
- All right, when Bradford
sees what we've done,

11:26.633 --> 11:29.367
it is really gonna
wrinkle his khakis.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.900
- These are pleated slacks.

11:34.067 --> 11:36.533
- Oh, that's a killer
Bradford impression.

11:36.633 --> 11:38.400
You really nailed
his "inner sadness."

11:42.500 --> 11:46.600
Now I have inner sadness.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.400
- Phoebe, what happened
to my door?

11:50.967 --> 11:53.667
- Oh.

11:53.767 --> 11:56.467
He stole his diary back.

11:56.567 --> 11:58.300
Max!

11:58.400 --> 12:01.400
- And you used your
Green Teens' key to help him.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.100
- Ma-a-a-a-ax!

12:03.200 --> 12:05.867
- Which means I get to shut
down the Green Teens.

12:05.967 --> 12:07.933
And you'll never see
that stink plant bloom,

12:08.067 --> 12:09.700
thanks to you and...

12:09.800 --> 12:11.700
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Say it with me...

12:11.800 --> 12:13.933
- BOTH: Max.

12:18.067 --> 12:19.967
- *

12:20.067 --> 12:22.833
- I can't wait to impress
the pants off Dark Mayhem.

12:22.933 --> 12:26.400
Wait, he does wear pants
under that robe, right?

12:26.500 --> 12:29.233
- I'm just disappointed
you got your chronicle back

12:29.333 --> 12:30.900
and no one got hurt.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.967
- Max, how could
you do that to me?

12:33.067 --> 12:34.867
Good job!

12:34.967 --> 12:36.767
- Using me to steal
your stupid book

12:36.867 --> 12:38.700
back from Bradford
is pretty low.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.600
I hope you're proud
of yourself.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.100
- I don't wanna brag,

12:42.200 --> 12:45.067
but, yeah, it was
pretty awesome, hey.

12:45.133 --> 12:46.533
- Bradford accused
me of helping you

12:46.633 --> 12:48.067
and shut down
the Green Teens.

12:48.133 --> 12:50.067
Because of you,
that stink plant is doomed.

12:50.167 --> 12:52.567
- Phoebe, it's just
smelly cabbage.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.767
- It's not just
about the plant.

12:54.867 --> 12:57.767
For once, I thought
you actually had my back.

12:57.867 --> 12:59.400
- I did have your back.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.133
Then I stabbed ya in it.

13:06.067 --> 13:08.400
Even after all the times
you've disappointed me,

13:08.500 --> 13:09.900
I always thought that

13:10.067 --> 13:11.967
deep down inside
you there was some good.

13:12.067 --> 13:13.900
Today made me realize

13:14.067 --> 13:17.133
you really are
just a bad person.

13:17.233 --> 13:19.567
So, I'm done wasting
my time on you.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.067
- Oh, come on.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.067
That's not how the whole
Max/Phoebe twin thing works.

13:23.133 --> 13:26.967
Hey...smack this book
outta my hand.

13:33.167 --> 13:35.900
- I gotcha, pal.

13:37.767 --> 13:42.433
- And, so, the Max/Colosso
thing begins.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.233
- We did it, Billy.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.067
We made Chloe a hat
that'll hide her hair

13:48.167 --> 13:50.800
and won't make Mom
and Dad suspicious.

13:50.900 --> 13:54.433
- I look good, baby!

13:54.533 --> 13:55.667
- Yeah, you do.

13:55.767 --> 13:58.467
And I made one for Colosso.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.867
You know he's gonna
ask for it.

14:08.067 --> 14:09.800
- It's the new hat
we made her out of love

14:09.900 --> 14:12.067
that she wants
to wear forever.

14:12.133 --> 14:14.700
Please, let her
wear it forever?

14:14.800 --> 14:16.733
- Barb, remember
how we wanted to make

14:16.833 --> 14:19.500
"The Many Months
of Chloe" calendar.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.400
- Oh, my gosh, she's a perfect
"May" right now!

14:22.500 --> 14:24.567
Can you guys make
a hat for each month?

14:24.667 --> 14:27.800
- No way!
That's like 70 hats.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.200
- Let's just make the hats
ourselves, Barb.

14:30.300 --> 14:33.633
- You grab the paper, I'll grab
Chloe and the scissors.

14:33.733 --> 14:36.067
- Yay, scissors!

14:38.833 --> 14:40.533
You can't take our plant!

14:40.633 --> 14:41.900
You can't take our plant!

14:42.067 --> 14:44.933
- Get your nerd chain
outta here!

14:45.067 --> 14:46.667
You're not even
a club anymore.

14:46.767 --> 14:48.167
- We're a new club--

14:48.267 --> 14:51.300
the Green Teenz with a "z".

14:51.400 --> 14:54.067
Green Teenz with a "z". Unh!

14:54.133 --> 14:57.067
Beat ya to it, Bradford.

14:57.167 --> 14:59.133
- Principal Bradford, if you
wanna bulldoze that plant,

14:59.233 --> 15:01.533
you're gonna have
to go through us.

15:03.133 --> 15:05.400
- You can go through
them, right?

15:06.933 --> 15:08.667
- Fine! Joke's on you, kids.

15:08.767 --> 15:10.300
I can stay here all night.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.167
I've got no hobbies,
friends...

15:12.267 --> 15:14.267
...or family.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.800
- Hold strong.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.400
He's trying to chase us away
with tales of his sad life.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.367
You can't take our plant!

15:22.467 --> 15:25.800
You can't take our plant!
You can't take our plant!

15:25.900 --> 15:28.367
You can't take our plant!

15:29.267 --> 15:32.433
- I'm ready for my close-up.

15:32.533 --> 15:34.633
- All right, we're almost
done with the hats.

15:34.733 --> 15:37.933
- We're so dead. We're so dead.
We're so dead!

15:38.067 --> 15:40.433
- Look, we're gonna be in
trouble no matter what.

15:40.533 --> 15:43.533
Maybe we'll get in less trouble
if we just admit what we did.

15:45.067 --> 15:48.267
We're so dead. We're so dead.
We're so dead!

15:48.367 --> 15:50.800
- Okay, where are the,
uh, scissors?

15:50.900 --> 15:53.167
- Um, you were using
them for July.

15:53.267 --> 15:55.867
- Oh, good, Chloe has 'em.

15:55.967 --> 15:57.767
Chloe has them!
- Oh!

15:57.867 --> 16:00.067
What have we done?

16:02.167 --> 16:04.100
- Mom, Dad we have
a confession to--

16:04.200 --> 16:06.167
- Whatever it is,
it can wait.

16:06.267 --> 16:08.900
Chloe cut her hair because
we left the scissors out.

16:10.767 --> 16:13.767
I mean...you did?

16:16.167 --> 16:18.200
- Don't beat yourself up.
This could happen to anyone.

16:18.300 --> 16:20.233
Like, literally,
anyone in this room

16:20.333 --> 16:23.133
could have made
the same exact mistake.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.833
- Hank, you grab Chloe.

16:24.933 --> 16:26.867
We're going to
the hair salon.

16:26.967 --> 16:29.733
- Yay, more scissors!

16:32.600 --> 16:35.433
- NORA & BILLY:
* We're so not dead

16:36.900 --> 16:38.900
- Okay, remember,
don't smile.

16:39.067 --> 16:40.500
Mayhem hates smiling.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.933
And check your shirt.
You've got schmutz on it.

16:43.067 --> 16:45.900
- Got it--
smile on my shirt.

16:47.233 --> 16:48.767
You've been acting weird

16:48.867 --> 16:51.933
ever since Phoebe
let you have it.

16:52.067 --> 16:54.067
- Uh, the only
weird thing is

16:54.167 --> 16:56.467
you cleaning my shirt
with your paw.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.367
- That's him!
That's enough.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.100
- Hello, Max.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.900
Is that schmutz
on your shirt?

17:08.067 --> 17:09.967
- Uh, sorry, my dark lord.

17:10.067 --> 17:13.467
I had a very evil bagel.

17:13.567 --> 17:16.233
- It's time for
your evil review.

17:16.333 --> 17:19.533
I want to know if you're
supervillain material.

17:19.633 --> 17:22.433
- Max, tell him how
you betrayed your sister.

17:22.533 --> 17:24.700
- Uh, well...

17:24.800 --> 17:26.067
there's really
not much to say.

17:26.133 --> 17:27.800
- Nonsense!

17:27.900 --> 17:29.833
Pushing away family
is a huge step

17:29.933 --> 17:32.067
on the road to
an evil life.

17:32.133 --> 17:35.100
I pushed my nana
into a tiger pit.

17:35.200 --> 17:38.433
And look at how happy
I am now.

17:38.533 --> 17:39.967
- Well, my sister
always thought

17:40.067 --> 17:42.067
there was good
in me somewhere,

17:42.133 --> 17:44.267
so I kinda used that to...

17:44.367 --> 17:46.833
- Come on, Max,
spit it out.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.267
- Get outta my head, Phoebe.

17:48.367 --> 17:51.200
- Did you just call
me "Phoebe"?

17:51.300 --> 17:55.233
- Uh, Max has girl
nicknames for everyone.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.767
He calls me "Sheila."

17:57.867 --> 18:00.067
Tell Dark Mayhem how I'm done
wasting my time on you.

18:00.133 --> 18:01.533
- Like I care.

18:01.633 --> 18:03.567
- I've always been
there for you

18:03.667 --> 18:05.067
and, evil or not,

18:05.167 --> 18:06.933
that's not something
you wanna lose.

18:07.067 --> 18:08.433
- I'm not gonna lose it.

18:08.533 --> 18:10.233
You'll just forgive me
like you always do.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.600
- Not this time.
Don't you get it?

18:12.700 --> 18:15.100
That whole Max/Phoebe
twin thing...

18:15.200 --> 18:17.200
it's over.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.867
- DARK MAYHEM:
Who are you talking to?

18:19.967 --> 18:21.967
This is why I hate
video chatting.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.933
I've gotta
get outta here.

18:24.067 --> 18:25.833
- DARK MAYHEM:
What?

18:25.933 --> 18:27.800
No one walks out
on Dark Mayhem!

18:30.533 --> 18:33.100
- So...
how's Mrs. Mayhem?

18:33.200 --> 18:35.267
- DARK MAYHEM:
Zip it, Sheila.

18:37.567 --> 18:38.867
- GREEN TEENZ:
* So gather round

18:38.967 --> 18:40.333
* The stink plant

18:40.433 --> 18:41.600
* We're gonna win this war

18:41.700 --> 18:43.533
* Huddle round
the stink plant *

18:43.633 --> 18:47.567
- * 'Cause Bradford
stinks much more! *

18:47.667 --> 18:50.400
- While you guys were
making my ears bleed,

18:50.500 --> 18:53.067
I downloaded
the bulldozer manual.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.333
Ha! Ha! Ha!

18:54.433 --> 18:56.267
Beat it, Johnny Rulebook!

18:56.367 --> 18:58.467
- Oh, no, he's gonna
bulldoze us.

18:58.567 --> 19:00.433
Run!

19:01.600 --> 19:03.633
Okay, tying ourselves
together was a bad idea.

19:03.733 --> 19:05.800
- Shuffle right!

19:07.367 --> 19:09.067
- So long, stinky!

19:11.867 --> 19:14.067
- Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

19:15.700 --> 19:19.433
- Phoebe, use your
telekinesis to stop him.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.900
- I can't get my hands free.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.900
What is happening?

19:35.867 --> 19:37.800
- Look. It's Max.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.600
- I'm not the only one who
can destroy clubs, Bradford.

19:40.700 --> 19:43.567
- Oh, no! No!

19:43.667 --> 19:46.267
My golf clubs!

19:54.167 --> 19:56.233
- STUDENTS:

19:58.467 --> 20:00.700
- Our positive energy and clever
use of the letter "z"

20:00.800 --> 20:02.567
saved the stink plant!

20:05.000 --> 20:06.900
- Phoebs, listen,

20:07.000 --> 20:08.100
I know you said
you're done with

20:08.200 --> 20:09.467
the whole Max/Phoebe
twin thing,

20:09.567 --> 20:12.200
but I'm hoping all this
changes your mind?

20:12.300 --> 20:14.667
- I don't know, Max.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

20:14.767 --> 20:16.833
I know you don't
think I have a heart.

20:16.933 --> 20:18.033
But I do.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.867
It's small...
but it's there.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.500
I'm not good at this.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.033
Smack the book
outta my hand.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.600
- Well, I guess
you did show up.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.367
Okay, this doesn't mean
I totally forgive you.

20:42.967 --> 20:44.933
- Thanks.

20:45.033 --> 20:48.133
- We did it, Green Teenz
with a "z".

20:48.233 --> 20:51.067
Look, the stink plant
is starting to bloom.

20:55.900 --> 21:00.100
- Wow, it's so beautiful.

21:00.200 --> 21:03.133
I can't wait to destroy it!

21:03.233 --> 21:05.067
Fore!

21:10.600 --> 21:13.067
It smells like my life.

21:13.133 --> 21:15.067
Ohhh...

21:17.100 --> 21:23.867
- *

21:23.967 --> 21:25.533
- Max, finally!

21:25.633 --> 21:27.600
Do you have any idea
what you did

21:27.700 --> 21:29.567
when you walked out
on Dark Mayhem?

21:29.667 --> 21:32.433
- I know. I threw away
my chance with him.

21:32.533 --> 21:36.167
- No, you impressed
the evil pants off him.

21:37.933 --> 21:39.800
- He loved that you had
the nerve to walk out on him.

21:39.900 --> 21:41.633
He's excited to
see what other evil

21:41.733 --> 21:43.533
you fill your
chronicle with.

21:43.633 --> 21:46.400
- Yes! I still have
an evil future.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.300
- So, why'd you run
out so fast?

21:49.400 --> 21:50.967
- Uh...I...

21:51.067 --> 21:53.067
was at a thing that I...
had to...

21:53.100 --> 21:54.733
you know?

21:54.833 --> 21:56.067
- PHOEBE: Tell him, Max.

21:56.100 --> 21:59.167
Tell him how much you care
about your twin sister.

21:59.267 --> 22:01.400
Fine. I care about you.

22:02.833 --> 22:05.667
That's all I ever
wanted to hear.

22:05.767 --> 22:07.800
- Oh...

22:10.867 --> 22:26.067
- *
