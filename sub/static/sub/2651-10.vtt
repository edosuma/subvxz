WEBVTT

00:02.899 --> 00:04.811
Haley! Hurry up.

00:04.899 --> 00:06.971
You don't have much time, and I
made chocolate chip pancakes.

00:07.061 --> 00:09.211
Mom, I'm not 12.
Dibs on hers.

00:09.340 --> 00:10.821
Honey, you excited
about your first day?

00:10.901 --> 00:12.415
You know what?
I really am.

00:12.501 --> 00:14.733
There's something about going to work
that makes you feel like you're-

00:14.822 --> 00:16.335
I don't know-
worth something.

00:16.423 --> 00:17.856
No offense, Mom.

00:17.943 --> 00:19.662
Listen.
I wanna give you some advice.

00:19.744 --> 00:21.302
Do it fast.
She's gonna be late.

00:21.383 --> 00:23.058
Work hard.
Uh-huh.

00:23.184 --> 00:25.017
Keep your eye on the ball.

00:25.105 --> 00:26.335
Stay focused.

00:26.426 --> 00:28.019
Never-

00:28.146 --> 00:30.182
- Check it out. Cam in overalls.
- Oh.

00:30.266 --> 00:32.497
Mitchell sent me the same text.

00:32.587 --> 00:34.145
Why "Look what you've done"?

00:34.227 --> 00:36.697
Oh, because Cam is helping me
out with that baseball field,

00:36.787 --> 00:38.586
and Mitchell hates it
when he gets all farmed up.

00:38.668 --> 00:43.027
His turn-offs are farm, Fizbo
and worst of all, Farmbo.

00:43.109 --> 00:47.423
Hey! Howdy, life partner.

00:48.951 --> 00:51.183
Well, I gotta go. Don't
wanna be late for my first-

00:51.312 --> 00:54.110
Oh, my God! Why didn't you
guys tell me the time?

00:55.112 --> 00:56.910
So, what do you think?

00:57.032 --> 00:59.707
Can we turn this into a baseball field?
Oh, yeah. No problem.

00:59.793 --> 01:04.072
You know, back on the farm, I once turned an
acre of corn into a snowflake-shape maze.

01:04.154 --> 01:05.874
Still be there if our neighbor
Billy-Bob Sheinberg...

01:05.995 --> 01:08.306
hadn't seen it from his crop duster
and said it looked like a swastika.

01:08.396 --> 01:09.465
Hmm.

01:09.556 --> 01:11.548
So how good's
Luke's team anyway?

01:11.637 --> 01:15.597
Well, you may have seen them on YouTube
under "Boy stuck in batting helmet"...

01:15.717 --> 01:18.073
or "Pitcher beans self."

01:18.157 --> 01:20.593
But a few of them went through
puberty early this year, so-

01:20.679 --> 01:22.795
They say it's because of
hormones in our milk,

01:22.878 --> 01:25.111
but whatever it is,
they really jacked up.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.681
Luke and Manny's team tied for
the final spot in the play-offs,

01:27.761 --> 01:30.913
but since nobody was expecting
it, all the fields were booked.

01:31.001 --> 01:33.039
The other team wanted to settle
with a coin flip.

01:33.122 --> 01:35.921
We said rock, paper, scissors.
That's when talks broke down.

01:36.003 --> 01:39.234
So what do you do
when you can't find a field?

01:39.363 --> 01:42.162
You build one.
And we got the last laugh.

01:42.244 --> 01:46.557
'Cause guess what I found there?
Rocks, paper and scissors.

01:46.685 --> 01:48.597
- I see home plate up here.
- Mm-hmm.

01:48.686 --> 01:50.757
I see pitcher's mound in here.

01:50.885 --> 01:53.606
And I see little boys' dreams
coming true ever here.

01:53.726 --> 01:56.288
I found a dead snake.
It's perfect.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.961
Not dead! Not dead!

01:58.047 --> 01:59.880
I'm gonna be
mother of the year.

02:00.649 --> 02:01.397
♪ Hey, hey ♪

02:08.490 --> 02:09.811
♪ Hey♪
♪

02:13.012 --> 02:16.085
And this is our dining room,
where we eat.

02:16.172 --> 02:18.767
And this is our kitchen,
where we also eat.

02:18.853 --> 02:20.925
Who are you talking to? It
looks like you lost your tour.

02:21.014 --> 02:22.164
Or your mind.

02:22.254 --> 02:23.528
The baby.

02:23.613 --> 02:26.174
Shorty's girlfriend, Darlene,
sent it to me.

02:26.255 --> 02:28.487
She said it's for
prenatal bonding.

02:28.576 --> 02:31.090
I love it. We took a tour
of the house.

02:31.175 --> 02:33.055
We took a look at all my shoes.

02:33.176 --> 02:35.851
Come on, Jay. Say something to the baby.
Darlene's an idiot.

02:35.937 --> 02:39.090
Oh, yeah, beautiful. Your first words
to our baby: "Darlene is an idiot."

02:39.177 --> 02:41.374
This is stupid.
The baby's only two inches away.

02:41.458 --> 02:43.211
He doesn't need speakers
blasting at him.

02:43.299 --> 02:46.060
Like in restaurants nowadays, where
you can't even hear yourself think.

02:46.099 --> 02:49.298
Ah, you're gonna do whatever
you want. Why do I bother?

02:49.381 --> 02:52.180
Get used to that. Sometimes you
just gotta let him go.

02:52.262 --> 02:54.014
Then he eats some sherbet
and falls asleep.

02:54.142 --> 02:55.656
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

02:55.741 --> 02:57.973
Okay, I'll chalk the field
with this bad boy.

02:58.102 --> 03:01.141
And while you're doing that, I will get the bases.
We make such a good team.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.743
Why does your friend
have a chalker?

03:02.824 --> 03:05.704
Oh, he used it to propose
to a skywriter.

03:05.784 --> 03:07.582
Oh, ma'am? Ma'am, do you
need help with that?

03:07.664 --> 03:09.179
Oh, yes, please.

03:09.266 --> 03:10.302
Is this your house?

03:10.386 --> 03:12.263
I'm moving in with my son.

03:12.386 --> 03:13.423
Oh.
He's rich.

03:13.506 --> 03:15.100
Phone-by-the-toilet
rich.

03:15.226 --> 03:17.025
Oh. Great. Have you
lived here a long time?

03:17.107 --> 03:20.625
I moved here in '62
to be an actress.

03:20.748 --> 03:23.662
I had one line
In a Rockford Files.

03:24.830 --> 03:25.866
"He went out the back."

03:25.990 --> 03:27.424
Oh.
Who went out the back?

03:27.590 --> 03:30.230
That was you. Okay.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.540
Well, you're all set here.

03:31.630 --> 03:33.702
You're not interested
in the place, are you?

03:33.832 --> 03:36.188
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, we are.

03:36.272 --> 03:38.025
Yes. Yes, we are.

03:38.153 --> 03:40.383
Come on. Okay.

03:41.793 --> 03:43.591
You gotta keep your eyes open.

03:43.673 --> 03:46.395
It's not natural when a ball
is hurtling at your face.

03:46.474 --> 03:49.514
- Will you choke up a little?
- Probably when they play the national anthem.

03:49.596 --> 03:52.270
No, move your hands up the bat.

03:52.355 --> 03:54.235
"When they play
the national anthem."

03:54.317 --> 03:55.750
I had a perfect record:

03:55.837 --> 03:58.148
Twenty-two games, and I hadn't
played a single inning.

03:58.237 --> 03:59.956
Then the McCoy twins'
grandma dies,

04:00.038 --> 04:01.995
and suddenly I'm starting
at right field.

04:02.078 --> 04:05.436
What does that even mean?
Is it the same as stage right?

04:05.519 --> 04:08.478
All right, ready?
Nice and easy.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.001
I haven't even thrown it yet.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.959
Then it's your fault.
I'm doing my part.

04:13.041 --> 04:16.273
Forget it. We need to do
something different.

04:16.402 --> 04:19.201
Let's change your stance.
Try leaning in.

04:19.283 --> 04:20.398
Further.

04:20.482 --> 04:22.839
Now close your eyes.

04:23.883 --> 04:25.477
Ow!
Ah. Perfect!

04:25.564 --> 04:27.602
You think you can
do that every time?

04:27.684 --> 04:29.165
What, get hit on purpose?

04:29.244 --> 04:31.363
If you wanna get on base
and be a hero.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.437
Some men are born
into greatness.

04:33.527 --> 04:35.119
Others have it chucked
at their face.

04:35.206 --> 04:37.119
- Ow.
- Yes!

04:38.007 --> 04:39.487
Okay, Mrs. Brooks.

04:39.567 --> 04:41.286
Thank you very much.
We'll be in touch very soon.

04:41.367 --> 04:43.565
- Say it one more time.
- "He went out the back."

04:43.649 --> 04:46.369
- Ah. Love it. Love it!
- Brava. Brava.

04:46.449 --> 04:47.804
Bye-bye.

04:47.929 --> 04:51.242
What do you think, Phil? Well,
I have to admit, it's a steal.

04:51.330 --> 04:53.322
Yes! Yes! I told you.

04:53.411 --> 04:55.612
And you said Gil Thorpe makes
a killing flipping houses.

04:55.691 --> 04:57.523
Yeah, he brags about it
all the time.

04:57.612 --> 04:59.605
Every time he makes a sale,
he calls himself Flipper...

04:59.692 --> 05:01.764
and walks around making
this dolphin sound, like-

05:03.614 --> 05:05.445
How does he do it?
I hate him so much.

05:05.534 --> 05:08.415
Look, if the four of us go in on this
together, we can minimize the risk.

05:08.494 --> 05:10.935
Or if none of us do it, we can
eliminate the risk altogether...

05:10.976 --> 05:12.774
because none of you know
anything about flipping houses.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.535
Well, we already
have it figured out.

05:14.617 --> 05:16.972
I'm gonna be the designer because
I know about colors and shapes.

05:17.057 --> 05:18.538
Yeah, so does Lily.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.211
I'm gonna be the contractor.

05:20.298 --> 05:22.739
And I'm gonna be the astronaut.
Oh, this is fun. Phil, you go.

05:22.779 --> 05:25.816
Mitchell, I am serious. I have
overseen lots of projects in our home.

05:25.898 --> 05:29.211
I oversaw the remodel of our
bathroom-under budget. Right, Phil?

05:29.300 --> 05:32.294
I was a little disappointed we didn't go for
the butt-washing toilet, but otherwise-

05:32.421 --> 05:35.300
You can wash your own butt for free.
That's not the same, is it?

05:35.381 --> 05:37.021
This is all fun to
talk about. It is.

05:37.102 --> 05:39.776
But I don't think that you understand
what this could really entail, and it-

05:39.863 --> 05:41.899
Okay, there it is. Mitchell
just said "no," so we're done.

05:41.983 --> 05:43.417
Surprise, surprise.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.538
Listen, we'll talk about
this at home, okay? Mmm.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.139
Don't give up.

05:48.264 --> 05:51.065
Phil, you think
it's a good idea, right?

05:51.225 --> 05:54.424
Totally. Yes. And you know
we can handle it, right?

05:54.547 --> 05:56.742
I think you guys can
handle anything. Aw.

05:56.826 --> 05:59.467
Yeah. Then you go talk to him. You're
a professional. He respects you.

05:59.548 --> 06:02.382
- Give us some space. I'll go talk him into it.
- All right.

06:02.467 --> 06:05.268
- All right?
- Okay.

06:05.388 --> 06:08.064
Listen. There's no way we're letting
them do this. I know, right?

06:08.149 --> 06:09.868
They are not equipped
to take this on.

06:09.949 --> 06:12.989
We might as well flush all our
savings down my boring old toilet.

06:13.071 --> 06:14.630
You are really bitter
about that.

06:14.710 --> 06:18.422
It's the one thing I asked for.
Don't sit on your sunglasses.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.272
Sorry, guys.

06:20.352 --> 06:22.628
Whoops.
Just to be clear though.

06:22.712 --> 06:24.831
Under no circumstances
are we letting 'em do this?

06:24.913 --> 06:26.792
I am totally with you.

06:26.874 --> 06:29.788
Okay, you stay here.
I'll go break the bad news.

06:29.875 --> 06:31.515
Sorry, guys.
Not gonna happen.

06:31.595 --> 06:32.996
Yeah, well, maybe if-
I would drop it.

06:33.076 --> 06:34.874
It is not worth the fight.
Come on, Claire.

06:34.955 --> 06:38.632
The faster we leave, the less
it's gonna hurt. Hop in. Yep.

06:42.198 --> 06:44.713
Why does it
have to be like this?

06:44.799 --> 06:47.315
I don't know. He's your brother.
Buckled up? Good.

06:47.399 --> 06:50.279
Oh, no, no, no! No, no.
I see what you're doing!

06:50.359 --> 06:52.080
He doesn't want this either!

06:52.201 --> 06:53.475
Little radio?
Sure.

06:53.561 --> 06:57.317
♪
♪ Phil! Claire!

06:57.401 --> 06:59.233
Come on!

07:06.764 --> 07:09.758
It's such a shame, because I know we
would do a great job on that house.

07:09.885 --> 07:12.321
Totally. If Gil Thorpe can
do it, I can do it, right?

07:12.405 --> 07:13.600
Please!

07:13.686 --> 07:16.361
Please. Gil Thorpe has
decades of experience...

07:16.447 --> 07:18.199
and infallible instincts.

07:18.286 --> 07:20.244
As much as we'd all like
to believe otherwise,

07:20.328 --> 07:22.523
I did not marry Gil Thorpe.

07:22.607 --> 07:25.204
Can you imagine that?

07:26.288 --> 07:28.407
God, we'd sell a lot of houses.

07:28.489 --> 07:31.483
- Oh. Great.
- Mitchell.

07:31.570 --> 07:34.290
You know what, Claire? You gotta cool down
or you're just gonna make this worse.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.409
Why don't you go get the
coffees, and I'll deal with him.

07:36.491 --> 07:38.005
Well, what are you
gonna say to him?

07:38.092 --> 07:39.572
I'm just gonna talk to him
man-to-man.

07:39.652 --> 07:41.371
Uh-All right.
Okay.

07:41.492 --> 07:43.564
Hello?

07:43.653 --> 07:45.849
Claire, Phil doesn't want
the house either, all right?

07:45.934 --> 07:47.613
He's letting me take the fall.
He's a liar.

07:47.694 --> 07:49.015
And a clever one.

07:49.054 --> 07:51.729
How long do you think
you can keep this from her?

07:51.815 --> 07:53.329
I'm gonna talk to her
eventually.

07:53.415 --> 07:55.567
Well, as long as we're swapping
stories, maybe I'll tell Cam...

07:55.656 --> 07:58.217
what happened to the sweater
he knit for you.

08:01.977 --> 08:04.413
I can't. I can't.
I can't. I can't do it.

08:04.498 --> 08:06.411
I can't take
this stupid thing anymore!

08:08.700 --> 08:10.700
It was stolen out of the car.
Do you understand me?

08:10.739 --> 08:12.220
Got it.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.175
That is low.

08:15.261 --> 08:18.777
I know. Don't be mad at me. That said,
I suggest you lose this number.

08:19.941 --> 08:21.422
I'm not proud of what I did,

08:21.502 --> 08:23.619
but I'm not comfortable
squashing people's dreams.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.183
I am a cheerleader.

08:25.264 --> 08:28.257
I'm the guy on top of the pyramid
shouting, "Go, dreams, go!"

08:28.344 --> 08:29.825
You know what's not a cheer?

08:29.905 --> 08:31.544
Two, four, six, eight!

08:31.624 --> 08:35.255
You are going to fail at this and lose
everything we've worked for, Claire!

08:36.346 --> 08:38.020
Hush,
little baby

08:38.107 --> 08:40.178
Don't say a word

08:40.265 --> 08:43.500
Papa's going to buy
you a mockingbird

08:43.587 --> 08:47.424
And if that mockingbird
won't sing

08:47.508 --> 08:51.220
Papa's gonna buy you
a diamond ring

08:51.310 --> 08:55.429
Papa'd buy 10 diamond rings to get
that mockingbird to shut the hell up.

08:55.510 --> 08:57.947
But I wasn't gonna tell Gloria
she was a terrible singer.

08:58.031 --> 09:01.231
That's just taking a bath
with a toaster.

09:01.313 --> 09:04.351
Still, the thought of that poor little
thing stuck in there like a hostage,

09:04.433 --> 09:07.710
listening to that racket
days on end.

09:07.793 --> 09:09.354
I just couldn't take it.

09:09.475 --> 09:13.151
And if that billy
goat won't push

09:13.236 --> 09:16.388
Papa's gonna kill
the billy goat

09:16.476 --> 09:17.910
I'll tell you what
Papa's gonna do.

09:18.036 --> 09:20.392
He's gonna take a turn on that mike.
Ay, really?

09:20.477 --> 09:22.868
Yeah. I've been thinking, if it's a
chance to bond, I should take it.

09:22.958 --> 09:25.108
Ay, Jay, that's great.

09:25.199 --> 09:27.031
I think that
the sound of my voice...

09:27.119 --> 09:28.997
shouldn't be the only thing
that the baby should hear.

09:29.079 --> 09:30.672
Same page.

09:30.759 --> 09:34.151
Breaker, breaker, Big Jay.
Baby, what's your 20? Over.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.791
Ay, that's so cute. You sound like Smokey
and the Bandido. Go on. Go on.

09:37.881 --> 09:39.953
Hi, kid. This is
your dad, Jay Pritchett.

09:40.041 --> 09:42.682
Uh, we're all pretty excited to meet you.
Just a heads-up-

09:42.762 --> 09:45.073
I might be a few years older
than you're expecting.

09:45.203 --> 09:49.038
But on the plus side,
we're very comfortable.

09:49.124 --> 09:50.844
What's that? Nothin'?

09:50.965 --> 09:52.365
Tough womb.

09:52.524 --> 09:54.722
What are you doing in there? You sleepin'?

09:54.846 --> 09:57.520
Are you sleeping?

09:57.607 --> 10:00.645
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
Still Daddy's turn.

10:04.488 --> 10:08.278
Dumb, dumb rock!

10:09.249 --> 10:11.684
Hey. Are you cryin'?

10:11.769 --> 10:14.410
No. No. I just
can't get this rock to budge.

10:14.491 --> 10:16.491
Okay, what did we learn
from A League of Their Own?

10:16.530 --> 10:17.760
No crying in baseball.

10:17.891 --> 10:20.361
No. That Madonna's a lousy
actress, and so are you.

10:20.492 --> 10:24.373
- What's really going on?
- Okay.

10:24.453 --> 10:29.210
You know, over the last couple of months,
I've applied for, like, five different jobs.

10:29.334 --> 10:30.814
I didn't know that.
No.

10:30.894 --> 10:34.525
I didn't tell anyone because
I didn't get them, Cam.

10:34.616 --> 10:37.495
I went to college, you know?

10:37.576 --> 10:41.332
And... I just want to be able to
contribute to my kids' education.

10:41.416 --> 10:45.253
And I want to be able to buy my
husband a present with my own money.

10:45.338 --> 10:47.489
Hey, you're preaching
to the choir director.

10:47.619 --> 10:49.576
It's actually why I became a
choir director.

10:49.658 --> 10:53.573
You became a part-time teacher
in a public school for money?

10:53.659 --> 10:57.496
I make more than you do. I
mean, before parking. But-

10:57.581 --> 11:01.257
Look, I'm sorry Mitchell
killed our house dream.

11:01.382 --> 11:05.093
You know, now especially that I know you wanted
to use the money for such noble reasons.

11:05.182 --> 11:06.138
Yeah.

11:06.223 --> 11:08.499
And also...

11:08.624 --> 11:11.423
there was this pair of boots.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.337
There's always a pair of boots.

11:19.227 --> 11:20.866
Mitchell, do you know
what I've realized?

11:20.946 --> 11:23.018
That some thoughts
are better left unexpressed?

11:23.108 --> 11:26.818
No. That in this relationship, I'm the
gas pedal, and you're the brakes.

11:26.908 --> 11:29.947
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Last week you said that
you were the painting and I was the frame.

11:30.028 --> 11:32.499
That's if we were artwork.
This is if we were a car.

11:32.590 --> 11:34.501
I know what part you'd be
if we were a horse.

11:34.590 --> 11:36.070
- Excuse me?
- Hmm?

11:36.151 --> 11:39.270
Claire and I bring you this great
opportunity, and you stop it cold.

11:39.352 --> 11:41.150
I guess that's what brakes do.

11:41.232 --> 11:44.146
You know what brakes also do? They
keep you from driving off cliffs.

11:44.233 --> 11:45.667
Maybe they're not cliffs.

11:45.792 --> 11:49.025
Maybe they're ramps ready to launch
us into new, exciting vistas.

11:49.114 --> 11:52.107
I am not the only one against this whole house thing.
Phil doesn't want it either.

11:52.194 --> 11:54.993
You keep saying that, but I find
that very, very hard to believe.

11:55.075 --> 11:57.988
Phil supports Claire.
Phil is a cheerleader.

11:58.075 --> 12:00.466
Why can't you be
more like Phil?

12:01.757 --> 12:04.671
And then it hit me.
I could be exactly like Phil.

12:04.758 --> 12:08.548
I could pretend to be on board, forcing
the cheerleader to be the bad guy.

12:08.639 --> 12:11.553
I know it's underhanded,
but that's the way I throw.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.320
Mitchell? You-You know what?
You've convinced me.

12:16.401 --> 12:20.362
If you and Claire and especially Phil
are into this, then I'm on board.

12:20.441 --> 12:23.081
What? Seriously?
Yes! 100%.

12:23.162 --> 12:26.042
In fact, why don't you call Claire
and Phil right now and tell them?

12:26.123 --> 12:29.720
Okay. It was the ramp thing, wasn't it?
You know, I felt really good about it.

12:30.764 --> 12:32.357
What?
Are you serious?

12:32.444 --> 12:34.640
That's fantastic!
Oh! I gotta tell Phil.

12:34.765 --> 12:37.041
I'll call you right back.
What's-What's up?

12:37.126 --> 12:39.242
Mitchell changed his mind.
He's all for it.

12:39.325 --> 12:40.840
We're flipping a house!

12:40.926 --> 12:43.203
Yeah!

12:46.327 --> 12:49.128
Well, hello, Phil. To what
do I owe this pleasure?

12:49.249 --> 12:52.526
Cut the crap. You wanna play chicken?
Chicken's my middle name.

12:52.610 --> 12:54.569
I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:54.610 --> 12:56.921
I'm just being supportive
of my partner and my sister,

12:57.050 --> 12:58.929
both of whom I love very much.

12:59.050 --> 13:00.610
How do you sleep at night?

13:00.691 --> 13:02.968
Soundly, knowing you'll do
the right thing.

13:03.051 --> 13:04.692
So how about it, Phil?

13:04.773 --> 13:07.332
You gonna stop this train?
'Cause these brakes are out.

13:07.413 --> 13:11.010
Oh. And I suggest
you lose this number.

13:11.093 --> 13:13.087
Mitchell?

13:13.175 --> 13:14.814
Mitchell!

13:17.095 --> 13:19.735
Yeah, I was pretty ticked off that
Mitchell double-crossed my double-cross.

13:19.855 --> 13:24.216
Then he stopped taking my calls, and so I
sent him the following carefully worded text:

13:25.577 --> 13:27.011
"You suck."

13:28.619 --> 13:32.738
I could tell Phil felt pretty hurt
and betrayed, so I responded:

13:32.819 --> 13:35.574
"How are you gonna cheerlead your
way out of this one, Buffy?"

13:35.660 --> 13:37.811
"We both know this house thing
is a disaster."

13:37.901 --> 13:42.134
"Then say something or I will.
I don't care if you tell Cam"-

13:42.221 --> 13:44.417
"I threw out
that hideous sweater"?

13:44.543 --> 13:46.744
I spent months knitting that
"hideous" sweater.

13:46.783 --> 13:48.422
Yeah.
How are we seeing this?

13:48.503 --> 13:50.381
They're using the group text
from yesterday.

13:50.504 --> 13:53.224
They have no idea these are
even coming to me. Okay.

13:53.305 --> 13:55.183
Oh! Here's another one.

13:55.265 --> 14:00.465
"We need to shut this house thing
down without them knowing it's us"?

14:00.585 --> 14:02.020
Oh! Well.

14:02.106 --> 14:04.701
"Too late."

14:04.788 --> 14:07.303
Uh-oh.

14:07.428 --> 14:10.660
Oh! No, that-
That's bad.

14:14.949 --> 14:19.422
Claire, I am so sorry. I know I should've
been more honest with you, but I-

14:19.511 --> 14:21.105
No, Phil. You know
what really kills me?

14:21.231 --> 14:25.146
Is you didn't believe in me, and you
believe in everything!

14:25.232 --> 14:27.952
You know, I knew
that sweater wasn't stolen.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.343
And here I pick blue yarn
to match your eyes,

14:30.434 --> 14:32.353
but I should've picked black
to match your heart.

14:32.473 --> 14:34.944
- Although you look amazing in black.
- Damn you.

14:35.035 --> 14:37.152
Come on.

14:39.036 --> 14:41.631
"...leaving 17 dead
and thousands without power."

14:41.716 --> 14:43.389
Ay, Jay, please!

14:43.476 --> 14:46.356
It's bad that the baby listens
to such terrible things.

14:46.477 --> 14:47.911
It's heard worse.

14:47.997 --> 14:49.910
Jay, do you know a good
one-hour dry cleaner?

14:49.998 --> 14:53.436
And I don't mean the "Must be in by 10:00,
only on weekdays, you need a coupon" kind.

14:53.520 --> 14:54.999
I mean a hard one hour.

14:55.079 --> 14:56.958
This conversation
feels like a hard one hour.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.475
And what do you need it
cleaned for? It's spotless.

14:59.561 --> 15:01.474
There's mustard here
from Reuben's Reuben.

15:01.562 --> 15:04.283
That's what happens when you put a
narcissist in charge of snack day.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.241
Okay, it's my turn again.

15:06.362 --> 15:08.752
Baby, it's your mother again-
Gloria?

15:08.842 --> 15:10.436
Why don't we give him a break?

15:10.524 --> 15:13.277
He probably needs a minute because he
just learned about a deadly tornado.

15:13.363 --> 15:15.162
Okay, stop calling him a he.

15:15.244 --> 15:17.806
What if he's a she,
and you're making her upset?

15:17.885 --> 15:19.558
I told you. That's just
the shorthand I'm using.

15:19.725 --> 15:21.798
Don't jump down my throat every time-Ay, yeah.
Because you always-

15:21.886 --> 15:23.366
What are you doing?

15:23.447 --> 15:26.246
Do you really want your unborn baby
to hear you fighting like this?

15:26.328 --> 15:29.878
Studies show it's unhealthy for a fetus
to be exposed to a stressful environment.

15:29.968 --> 15:31.960
Studies? You're 13.
Read a comic book.

15:32.049 --> 15:33.801
What time does your game start?

15:33.889 --> 15:35.609
I have to be there at 3:00
for hitting practice.

15:35.690 --> 15:36.839
Batting practice.

15:36.930 --> 15:38.523
Not for me.

15:38.610 --> 15:43.367
Jay, I don't want our baby to think
that he's coming into an unhappy home.

15:43.452 --> 15:47.288
Let's promise that we're never ever
going to fight in front of him.

15:47.372 --> 15:49.887
- No fighting in front of the baby.
- Okay, good.

15:51.733 --> 15:56.412
Twinkle, twinkle,
little lamb

15:56.535 --> 15:58.493
Gloria, stop it! Stop it.
I am going-

15:58.615 --> 16:00.175
No more singing.
Why?

16:00.255 --> 16:02.452
Because you stink.

16:02.537 --> 16:04.927
You're a terrible singer.

16:05.016 --> 16:06.737
Come on.
Let's get some lunch.

16:08.737 --> 16:11.094
- How dare do you tell me that I am-
- Ah, ah, ah, ah!

16:11.179 --> 16:13.978
No, no, no. No fighting in front of the baby.
We just made a deal.

16:14.059 --> 16:17.211
Yeah, but that's not fair because
I am always in front of the baby!

16:17.340 --> 16:19.537
Gloria, you're as close
to perfect as a woman gets.

16:19.620 --> 16:21.577
Nothing wrong with
one tiny little flaw.

16:21.661 --> 16:25.496
Yours is when you start to sing, it sounds like
something got stuck in the vacuum cleaner.

16:25.621 --> 16:27.740
That's your-Ah, ah, ah!
No, no, no.

16:29.102 --> 16:33.257
That is just your
stupid, stupid opinion, Jay.

16:33.344 --> 16:36.894
But I am very angry at you,
and I am gonna make a list...

16:36.984 --> 16:39.706
of all the things that I am
going to scream at you...

16:39.826 --> 16:42.819
as soon as this baby
is out of me.

16:45.427 --> 16:48.102
I didn't think it
all the way through.

16:51.028 --> 16:52.588
Oh, hello, Mitch.

16:52.709 --> 16:55.430
You got Claire flowers? Yes. I had
a little bit of a rough night.

16:55.509 --> 16:57.068
Yeah, you and me both.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.187
Daddy slept in my room
last night.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.831
Here. Give me some of those.
What? No.

17:00.910 --> 17:02.583
You got me into this. Hey, stop!
You're breaking 'em!

17:02.671 --> 17:05.585
I'm not going to Cam empty-handed!
Phil, let go of the-

17:07.873 --> 17:08.829
Whoa.

17:12.154 --> 17:14.191
Ow! Hold still!

17:14.272 --> 17:17.186
Claire and Cam did all this?

17:17.314 --> 17:19.830
A week ago, that was all junk.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.909
It's amazing. I mean, there's that little
bump in the middle, but other than that-

17:22.994 --> 17:25.192
Even if one of those boys
had hit five home runs,

17:25.276 --> 17:26.996
the biggest star
on that field was Claire.

17:27.076 --> 17:29.308
That's the funny thing
about marriage.

17:29.398 --> 17:31.913
You fall in love with this
extraordinary person,

17:31.998 --> 17:34.308
and over time,
they begin to seem ordinary.

17:35.559 --> 17:37.995
I think it's all the nagging.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.601
Wow. This-
This is incredible.

17:44.682 --> 17:46.638
You literally saw
a diamond in the rough.

17:46.722 --> 17:50.114
Yeah, but I take on a lot of
projects no one else is willing to.

17:50.243 --> 17:51.724
I deserve that.
Mm-hmm.

17:51.803 --> 17:55.160
I was an idiot for doubting you.
Please, honey, forgive me.

17:55.244 --> 17:58.043
How could I not, when you give me
this bouquet of crumpled flowers?

17:58.165 --> 17:59.997
Mitchell did that!
Mitchell again?

18:00.085 --> 18:01.600
Ask Lily!

18:01.726 --> 18:03.478
Hey, Cam.
Hey.

18:03.565 --> 18:05.206
Here you-Okay.
Well-

18:05.326 --> 18:07.238
Oh, wow. Broken and mangled.
Mm-hmm.

18:07.326 --> 18:09.125
Just like my heart.

18:09.208 --> 18:11.245
Cam, I'm sorry
for not supporting you.

18:11.367 --> 18:13.008
What about the sweater?
That's unforgivable.

18:13.088 --> 18:16.170
You put all that time and work into it,
and I just toss it out the car window.

18:16.250 --> 18:19.163
Tossed it out the car window? I'm
forgetting how much you knew.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.003
You know what, guys?
Honestly, I-I-

18:21.090 --> 18:23.451
I think we should do it. I think
we should go for the house.

18:23.491 --> 18:25.687
Okay, but careful, honey. Don't say
something if you don't mean it.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.368
No, I do mean it. I think you
two will do a fantastic job.

18:28.453 --> 18:30.330
You know, I do too.
I'm on board.

18:30.413 --> 18:33.088
- On board for what?
- Well, the four of us might go in on a house.

18:33.174 --> 18:34.892
Claire and I fix it up
and flip it.

18:34.974 --> 18:37.284
- That's the worst idea I ever heard.
- Okay.

18:37.374 --> 18:39.525
You guys know nothing
about construction.

18:39.614 --> 18:41.288
You'll make all sorts
of mistakes.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.890
You'll turn on each other.
You'll stop talking.

18:43.976 --> 18:46.366
And suddenly I'm doing two
dinners a week instead of one...

18:46.457 --> 18:48.609
because you can't be
in the same room.

18:48.738 --> 18:50.251
Family and business
doesn't mix.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.694
Ah, you're gonna do whatever
you want. Why do I bother?

18:53.179 --> 18:54.692
Is he right?

18:54.778 --> 18:56.975
You know Dad.
I mean, he's a pessimist.

18:57.059 --> 19:00.258
I want us to get that house. I do.
But I don't want us to fight.

19:00.339 --> 19:02.457
- We're not gonna fight.
- Of course not.

19:02.580 --> 19:03.776
Probably.

19:03.860 --> 19:06.172
I don't know. Will we?

19:06.301 --> 19:08.418
Maybe we just take a beat
and think about it.

19:08.541 --> 19:10.852
Yeah. I-I guess that couldn't hurt.
Yeah.

19:10.943 --> 19:13.618
You guys mean the world to us. I don't
want to jeopardize that over a house.

19:13.744 --> 19:15.417
We feel the same way.
Yeah.

19:15.543 --> 19:18.776
You know what?
I know we'd do a good job though.

19:18.905 --> 19:20.179
Hello?
And I have so many-

19:20.265 --> 19:21.939
It's Mrs. Brooks,
the lady with the house.

19:22.025 --> 19:24.495
Actually, it's good
that you called.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.823
What?
What happened?

19:26.907 --> 19:29.582
Gil Thorpe just made her
an offer.

19:29.748 --> 19:31.785
We did it!
We bought a house.

19:31.867 --> 19:33.303
It's gonna be great!

19:33.388 --> 19:35.267
What could go wrong?
Nothing.

19:37.349 --> 19:39.261
Sometimes I don't
understand people.

19:39.349 --> 19:42.788
They do crazy things
for the dumbest reasons.

19:42.870 --> 19:45.227
I'm going to march out there
and swing as hard as I can.

19:45.311 --> 19:48.464
And if every sports movie is correct,
I'm going to smack that ball,

19:48.551 --> 19:51.465
and everyone will chant my name
as I round the bases.

19:51.552 --> 19:54.308
By the way, is it always
counterclockwise, or do I get to choose?

19:54.393 --> 19:56.430
I don't think
it's gonna matter.

19:56.514 --> 19:58.871
They convince themselves
it'll all work out.

19:58.955 --> 20:00.832
Please rise
for the national anthem.

20:03.156 --> 20:04.430
I'm gonna show you
who can sing.

20:04.555 --> 20:05.911
Gloria. Hmm.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.477
Oh, this is gonna be rough.

20:07.556 --> 20:10.517
Despite all the evidence
to the contrary.

20:10.597 --> 20:15.515
O say can you see

20:15.598 --> 20:19.674
By the dawn's early light?

20:19.760 --> 20:21.513
Which I guess isn't so bad.

20:21.600 --> 20:27.473
And the rocket's red glare!

20:27.561 --> 20:31.841
All I'm saying is, I hope to God you
don't have your mother's singing voice.

20:31.923 --> 20:34.836
But, man, I hope you get
her self-confidence.

20:38.285 --> 20:40.966
Try to get some sleep.
I'll talk to you in the morning.

20:46.167 --> 20:50.208
Two outs, bottom of the sixth.
Tied at 4.

20:50.288 --> 20:51.801
This is it, folks.

20:51.887 --> 20:53.685
The whole game comes
down to this.

20:53.807 --> 20:55.766
Manny Delgado, 0
for 3 on the day.

20:55.848 --> 20:57.328
Gloria, your thoughts?

20:57.408 --> 21:00.322
I think he's going to hit
the home run.

21:00.409 --> 21:01.889
Please, God, give me one.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.008
Manny, stand up straight!

21:04.090 --> 21:05.212
But bend your knees.

21:05.291 --> 21:06.646
Widen your stance!

21:06.732 --> 21:07.961
Would you please let me ju-

21:08.051 --> 21:09.565
- Ooh!
- Take your base!

21:09.692 --> 21:11.968
You did it! Run, Manny!
I did it? Yeah!

21:12.052 --> 21:14.569
No, no, no, no! Not that way!
Go this way! Why do I bother?

21:14.653 --> 21:16.088
He's gonna do what he wants.

21:16.214 --> 21:20.606
Manny! Manny! Manny!

21:20.695 --> 21:23.335
Manny! Manny! Manny!
