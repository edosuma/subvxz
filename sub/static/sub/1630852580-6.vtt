WEBVTT

00:29.562 --> 00:31.898
I mean, the clock is ticking.
Feeling anything kicking,

00:31.998 --> 00:33.400
Kiki and I have had
a lot of time together,

00:33.500 --> 00:36.036
and we laugh constantly
and it's awesome.

00:36.102 --> 00:37.237
Like, we just sit there
and seem to have

00:37.337 --> 00:38.705
the same sense of humor,
so...

00:38.772 --> 00:40.106
- Kiki. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. I'm Grant.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.608
Nice to meet you.
Want to do a photo?

00:41.708 --> 00:43.243
Yeah, let's do it.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.114
Tapping that ass already.
You just got here.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.549
- Yeah, it's comfortable.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.351
Clearly, you've got
something brewing.

00:51.418 --> 00:54.187
I would definitely advise, you
know, focus on that and see --

00:54.254 --> 00:55.455
Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.057
How about you, Joel?

00:57.123 --> 00:58.758
You know, Stephanie's been
the most intriguing to me.

00:58.858 --> 01:01.194
I think we got some nice
similarities.

01:01.261 --> 01:03.430
Like, I think we're both
kind of very young at heart.

01:03.530 --> 01:04.697
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:04.764 --> 01:06.433
I'm definitely
super monogamous.

01:06.533 --> 01:09.102
And I really, really dig Deneia,
you know?

01:09.202 --> 01:10.703
Like, when I first walked
through that door

01:10.770 --> 01:12.238
on the first day,
you know,

01:12.305 --> 01:14.107
Deneia caught my eye,
and I was like,

01:14.207 --> 01:16.276
yeah, I know where my focus
is gonna be.

01:16.376 --> 01:17.610
You know, just something
about her,

01:17.710 --> 01:19.079
and then getting
to know her, you know?

01:19.145 --> 01:20.780
The tough calls
we gotta make at this point.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.450
If nothing else, Joel,
coffee is for closers.

01:23.550 --> 01:26.553
We got the coffee.
We just need the closers now.

01:34.394 --> 01:36.162
Legal studies and business
are like --

01:36.262 --> 01:37.163
Oh, shit.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.965
To be continued.

01:39.065 --> 01:40.934
- Ah!
- Ah!

01:41.000 --> 01:42.335
- Meddle time.
- Meddle time!

01:42.435 --> 01:44.337
- Meddle time!
- Oh!

01:44.437 --> 01:46.840
- Ooh!
- Ooh, Carlie!

01:52.812 --> 01:53.980
- Ooh. Okay.
- Ooh!

01:54.080 --> 01:55.648
- That'll be fun.
- That'll be nice.

01:55.748 --> 01:57.317
Which mom do you choose?

01:57.417 --> 02:00.854
I would like my dad to go
on a date with Trish today.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.456
- Oh, yay!
- Yes. So excited.

02:03.523 --> 02:04.858
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, crap.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.494
- Oh.
- Oh, no.

02:07.594 --> 02:10.830
"Instead of walking, you must
dance everywhere today."

02:10.930 --> 02:12.799
- Oh, my. That's pretty good.

02:12.866 --> 02:16.169
Stop! Bro, I cannot dance!

02:18.471 --> 02:20.173
You gotta go press --
you gotta go press the screen.

02:20.273 --> 02:24.677
Only for my dad, y'all.
Like, literally nobody else.

02:25.778 --> 02:27.280
- Got her!
- Wait. Really?

02:27.347 --> 02:29.149
- Dance!
- You gotta dance!

02:29.215 --> 02:30.884
Oh, shoot, okay.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.521
Patricia is not
typically the type

02:34.621 --> 02:35.822
my dad would go for physically

02:35.889 --> 02:37.690
because, like,
I've never seen my dad

02:37.790 --> 02:39.893
with the blondes or, like,
a blue-eyed lady,

02:39.993 --> 02:42.795
but I'm really interested
to see how things go.

02:42.862 --> 02:45.498
Yes.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.000
- Oh!
- Meddle time!

02:47.066 --> 02:49.869
- Two in a row.
- Another one.

02:49.969 --> 02:51.204
Ooh.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.907
"Brooks, give your dad
two squirt guns

02:54.007 --> 02:55.909
the use with the mom
of your choice."

02:56.009 --> 02:58.344
- Ooh. Wow.
- That's fun.

02:58.411 --> 03:00.713
Um, I'm gonna go with
Brennen's mom.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.348
Brennen's mom is named
Stephanie.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.584
My dad's ex-wife, my mom's, name
is Stephanie.

03:04.684 --> 03:07.253
Yeah, that's a fun date,
yeah.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.721
- But!
- Oh.

03:08.821 --> 03:10.723
"You must be a butler for the
day for the kid..."

03:10.823 --> 03:12.492
- Yes! The answer is yes.
- Oh.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.095
I don't mind, you know?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.997
Yes, I wish to proceed.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.699
All right.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.868
I thought Stephanie
would be a good pick for my dad

03:21.935 --> 03:24.737
because it seemed like, of some
of the people in the house,

03:24.837 --> 03:26.906
they both weren't really
connecting with anyone.

03:27.006 --> 03:28.741
They seemed to like
a lot of the same things.

03:28.841 --> 03:31.544
I know my dad's really into
music, and she's a performer.

03:31.611 --> 03:34.380
So I thought that, you know,
probably was a good idea.

03:34.447 --> 03:35.715
Uh, Mr. Brooks?

03:35.782 --> 03:38.251
Actually, could I get
a candy, please?

03:38.351 --> 03:39.552
Yeah, sure.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.621
Brennen:
Brooks picks my mom for a date,

03:41.721 --> 03:46.259
and because of that, he gets
to be my butler for a day.

03:46.359 --> 03:48.928
I think I'm gonna call him
"Mr. Brooks."

03:49.028 --> 03:50.630
- Thank you.
- Oh, that is -- that's classy.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.765
Appreciate it.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.474
- Want to go here?
- Yeah.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.142
- There we go.
- Perfect. Thank you.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.111
- You betcha.
- Oh, my God!

04:05.211 --> 04:06.746
Ah!

04:06.813 --> 04:08.147
- How about to cheers?
- How about -- yes.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.449
- Yeah.
- To new friendship.

04:09.549 --> 04:10.950
- New friendships.
- See what happens, yes.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.485
And a wonderful time.
Yes, indeed.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.487
Ah! He's so cute!

04:14.587 --> 04:16.055
Look at his first
little date!

04:16.122 --> 04:17.490
Ah!

04:17.590 --> 04:19.626
So what made you check into
the Second Chance Retreat?

04:19.726 --> 04:21.661
My oldest had graduated
from college.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.496
My youngest just graduated
from high school.

04:23.596 --> 04:27.166
And, like, the whole life just
sort of shifted life events.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.102
And so when the opportunity
came, I was just like,

04:29.168 --> 04:30.737
"This is, like,
the coolest thing ever."

04:30.803 --> 04:33.006
You can meet somebody
and, like, a life partner.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.307
Yeah, yeah.

04:34.407 --> 04:35.808
My dad sounds
a little serious.

04:35.908 --> 04:38.144
Like, he's like --
I don't know if he's nervous,

04:38.244 --> 04:41.114
but, like, you can tell, like,
he's not like fully, like...

04:41.180 --> 04:43.583
Yes! Yes, exactly.

04:43.650 --> 04:44.784
Yeah.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.753
Sense of humor
is absolutely crucial.

04:46.819 --> 04:48.354
Loving heart --
absolutely crucial.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.490
Someone who loves their kids
and loves family --

04:50.590 --> 04:51.658
absolutely crucial.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.159
That's exactly me.

04:53.259 --> 04:56.796
You know, I'm just looking
for friendship, life partner,

04:56.863 --> 04:59.699
someone that I can
share my life with...

04:59.799 --> 05:01.467
...because
I'm all into family.

05:01.534 --> 05:04.470
So it just keeps re-creating
family, that love, that bond.

05:04.537 --> 05:06.306
I feel like that's kind of
what he's looking for.

05:06.372 --> 05:09.309
Like, since the divorce, we've
really had a broken family...

05:09.375 --> 05:12.478
...like, small holidays,
small -- like, no gatherings.

05:12.545 --> 05:15.448
Everything he's saying,
Mom's exactly the same way back.

05:15.515 --> 05:16.983
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.186
I definitely think there is
a connection with Mom and Grant.

05:20.286 --> 05:21.788
They're smiling ear to ear.

05:21.854 --> 05:24.524
I just feel like this date
is going really, really well.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.526
And this is the most
I've actually seen her smile

05:26.626 --> 05:27.827
this whole entire time.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.195
You had me as soon as
you got out the cake.

05:29.295 --> 05:30.463
Exactly, yeah.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.031
I was like,
"Happy birthday to Trish,"

05:32.131 --> 05:33.399
declared it out.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.802
Trish is a absolute hoot.

05:35.868 --> 05:37.136
We are dying laughing,

05:37.203 --> 05:38.971
and I love a woman
who makes me laugh.

05:39.038 --> 05:41.240
There's just a vibe about her
that you want to be around her.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.210
I'm very excited to build
on this and see where it goes.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.879
Can we have our own...

05:48.181 --> 05:49.515
- Meddle activated!
- Meddle activated!

05:49.582 --> 05:51.250
Oh, my gosh!

05:53.553 --> 05:56.155
- That is so funny.
- That's great.

05:56.222 --> 05:58.157
- There they are.
- There's the floaties.

05:58.224 --> 05:59.726
Ah!

05:59.826 --> 06:02.862
- Hello.
- All right.

06:02.929 --> 06:04.263
- Hi.
- Hi!

06:04.364 --> 06:07.500
Hi. I'm Nicole.
I'm covering for Jimmy today.

06:07.567 --> 06:08.935
- Hi, Trish.
- How are you?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.437
I'm good. All right.
Grant, this is for you.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.572
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, wow.

06:12.672 --> 06:13.740
Oh, wow.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.241
And, Grant,
this is also for you.

06:15.341 --> 06:16.342
- Uh-oh!
- Uh-oh!

06:16.409 --> 06:17.543
Good Lord, have mercy.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.213
"Grant, get ready for some
daytime fun.

06:20.279 --> 06:22.749
Please join Patricia
for some one-on-one time

06:22.849 --> 06:24.217
in this floatie for two."

06:24.283 --> 06:25.585
- Ow!
- All right.

06:25.685 --> 06:28.087
- Yeah!
- Floatie for two.

06:28.187 --> 06:29.922
This will be fun.
This is a blooper.

06:30.022 --> 06:33.426
- Yeah. You going first.
- Yeah.

06:33.526 --> 06:34.727
- You ready?
- Hold it tight.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.063
- Holy crap.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.932
I'm going in. I know exactly
what's gonna happen.

06:40.032 --> 06:41.300
- I'm more out.
- Ready?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.436
Oh, shit. Ugh!

06:43.536 --> 06:45.605
Oh. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.941
- Oh, no.
- Don't fall.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.310
- Ah!
- No! Don't tip!

06:51.411 --> 06:52.612
You can do it!

06:52.712 --> 06:54.147
You think
they're gonna fall off?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.949
Yes, 100%.

06:57.049 --> 06:59.652
Can somebody save them?
Can somebody?

06:59.752 --> 07:01.220
- Yes!
- Ahhhh!

07:01.287 --> 07:03.956
- Okay!
- This is so -- okay.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.627
Oh, here we go.
You paddle with your --

07:07.727 --> 07:08.995
use your left hand.
There we go.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.229
We're coming down there.

07:10.296 --> 07:11.330
We're coming down there!

07:11.431 --> 07:12.999
I don't reach.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.802
Grant is fitting in perfect.
He's funny.

07:15.902 --> 07:19.172
He seems just family-oriented.
We have a lot in common.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.940
We start joking with each other.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.309
I think he's a good-looking man
and personality comes out,

07:23.409 --> 07:25.778
which makes him even
better-looking for me.

07:25.845 --> 07:28.147
We're making no progress.
Look at this.

07:28.247 --> 07:30.950
My man is here on the show.
I think he is.

07:31.017 --> 07:32.151
Let me get you close.

07:32.251 --> 07:33.352
Whoa!

07:35.087 --> 07:36.155
Yay! We made it!

07:36.255 --> 07:37.490
Nailed the dismount.

07:37.590 --> 07:38.825
I really like your mom.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.760
Your dad's freaking amazing.
He's so sweet.

07:40.827 --> 07:42.295
They both deserve love.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.430
Like, that's what I love
about all of this.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.200
There you are, kind sir.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.434
Ah, wonderful.
Thank you, Mr. Brooks.

07:48.501 --> 07:50.269
Yes, yes, of course.

07:50.336 --> 07:52.505
Am I doing this right? Is this
supposed to be on this --

07:52.605 --> 07:53.806
all this on the same arm?

07:53.873 --> 07:55.341
No, it's great.
Perfect. Perfect.

07:55.441 --> 07:57.310
Awesome.

07:58.678 --> 08:00.780
- Oh, meddle activated.
- Meddle activated.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.949
Oh, hey, everyone.
You all look gorgeous.

08:03.015 --> 08:06.452
- Jimmy's been fired.
- No, he's taking a day off.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.321
Oh! He can have a day off.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.223
- What happened to Jimmy?
- I don't know.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.824
Taking the day off.

08:11.891 --> 08:15.027
"Joel, feel like a kid again
with these squirt guns

08:15.127 --> 08:17.697
for an innocent encounter
with Stephanie."

08:17.797 --> 08:19.398
- Ah!
- Oh!

08:19.499 --> 08:22.301
We've got
the hydro blaster.

08:22.368 --> 08:23.870
So look at this?
You just put it in.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.738
- That.
- And you go like this.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.240
Like that.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.642
There's Stephanie. There.
Immediately not awkward.

08:29.709 --> 08:30.676
Yeah.

08:30.743 --> 08:32.879
Ah! Aah!

08:32.979 --> 08:35.715
That's my dad right there.

08:35.815 --> 08:38.985
Yo!
Hit me with your best shot!

08:43.723 --> 08:44.991
Ah!

08:45.057 --> 08:46.592
So what do you think so far?
You think, like, they got

08:46.692 --> 08:48.361
a little vibe going on?

08:48.427 --> 08:49.896
'cause it's like,
you know,

08:49.996 --> 08:51.531
I haven't really seen him,
like, act like this

08:51.597 --> 08:53.165
since I was like a kid,
you know?

08:53.232 --> 08:54.667
Yeah, 'cause, like, he can be
pretty serious at times.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.736
- He's having fun.
- Yeah, he's just having fun.

08:56.836 --> 08:57.937
I don't know.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.405
I don't really think
they were a match

08:59.505 --> 09:00.506
for metal mama.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.174
Uh, right.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.043
I like how they're both
kicking around and swinging.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.012
You have a good idea
of what you're looking for,

09:06.078 --> 09:08.214
you know, as far as a guy?

09:08.281 --> 09:10.883
Yes, it's been extended,
I think, a little longer

09:10.950 --> 09:13.252
because I had to raise my kids
pretty much by myself

09:13.352 --> 09:17.223
for like 10 years,
so that was my first priority.

09:17.290 --> 09:21.227
And also developing myself,
being married really young.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.796
You know, being a wife at 18,
it was --

09:23.896 --> 09:24.931
Well, but that's
what's interesting,

09:25.031 --> 09:26.265
because you got married at 18,

09:26.365 --> 09:28.100
so you never even had
the dating phase of life.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.802
No, 'cause I just skipped
from being a teenager

09:29.902 --> 09:31.904
to being a mother,
so the entire middle

09:31.971 --> 09:34.807
that everybody gets to do,
I completely

09:34.907 --> 09:38.477
never did until after I was
divorced at 35.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.646
You must have, when you first
got divorced, had to have been,

09:40.746 --> 09:42.081
like, "Okay."

09:42.148 --> 09:44.116
Yeah, exactly.

09:44.216 --> 09:46.285
Something I am noticing,
though, is my dad is, like --

09:46.385 --> 09:48.154
you see there? He's, like,
kicking around a lot.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.422
He's probably excited.

09:49.488 --> 09:50.823
And instead of,
like, being overly

09:50.923 --> 09:53.225
like, you know,
overbearing kind of,

09:53.292 --> 09:54.894
he's just kind of, like,
swinging around

09:54.961 --> 09:56.162
a little bit,
he's having a little fun,

09:56.262 --> 09:57.763
'cause that's --

09:57.830 --> 09:59.131
Yeah.

09:59.231 --> 10:00.766
I do know what I want
at this point in my life --

10:00.833 --> 10:03.903
somebody who is confident.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.305
I would date
a lot of very passive men.

10:06.405 --> 10:08.007
Like, they wouldn't even
tell me no.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.643
Some women love that.

10:10.743 --> 10:13.579
I just want somebody to say,
"Oh, no, no, no," you know?

10:13.646 --> 10:15.147
- That's enough.
- Yeah.

10:15.247 --> 10:19.018
They're -- I think they're
very compatible, actually.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.653
What kind of women
do you like?

10:20.753 --> 10:22.822
A woman who is confident,

10:22.922 --> 10:25.358
who's, you know, a go-getter,
hustler, strong,

10:25.458 --> 10:28.194
but yet still
has their caretaking...

10:28.294 --> 10:29.462
Yes, nurturer

10:29.528 --> 10:31.163
...nurturing side,
the nurture side.

10:31.263 --> 10:34.300
Joel -- I notice
he's pretty direct, you know,

10:34.367 --> 10:36.302
is pretty much no bullshit.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.137
And I'm very attracted
to the personality.

10:38.204 --> 10:41.607
Our conversation -- it actually
made me feel closer to him.

10:41.674 --> 10:44.176
He's somebody that I'd like
to get to know better.

10:44.276 --> 10:46.345
So good job, Joel.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.518
Oop, there go
Troy and Karen

10:52.618 --> 10:54.987
on the little love float.

10:55.054 --> 10:57.289
- They are chilling.
- They're cute, guys.

10:57.356 --> 10:59.225
They are cute together.
Oh, wow.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.661
It just is, like,
red flags for me.

11:01.727 --> 11:03.996
Like a man.

11:04.063 --> 11:06.365
Not -- not -- not --
<i>not</i> a kid.

11:06.465 --> 11:08.167
Mm-hmm. Totally.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.036
What do you think
your dream house looks like?

11:10.136 --> 11:12.071
- My dream house?
- Mm-hmm. Your forever home.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.640
Dude, they're both thinking
this is forever.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.410
I don't have
a forever home in my head yet...

11:18.811 --> 11:20.212
...because I don't have
my forever person,

11:20.312 --> 11:21.847
and that's something
to discuss together.

11:21.914 --> 11:24.216
But I do want a condo
in Puerto Rico,

11:24.316 --> 11:26.385
but there's a different story of
when you're already married

11:26.485 --> 11:28.020
and you guys
are building something.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.422
Yeah, I don't have
any problem with

11:29.522 --> 11:30.890
moving forward together
with our finances.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.325
Why are they talking about
finances together?

11:33.392 --> 11:35.828
That's how
you solidify a thing.

11:35.895 --> 11:37.430
- Wait.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.998
- Hold on.
- How's the money gonna work?

11:39.065 --> 11:40.433
- What?
- Yeah.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.101
That's what I want.
That's why I want to get married

11:42.201 --> 11:45.237
and I'm not looking
to get divorced again.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.239
Exactly.
Oh, I'm getting divorced again.

11:47.339 --> 11:49.108
I'm gonna be...

11:49.208 --> 11:52.078
My husband's gonna bury me,
or I'm gonna be a widow.

11:52.178 --> 11:53.446
I am like, "Sit down.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.948
You're working this out
right now.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.283
We are working this out."

11:57.383 --> 11:58.751
I'm<i> not</i> going
through that again.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.287
The connection with Troy
is absolutely wonderful.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.756
We're just talking about
so many wonderful things

12:03.856 --> 12:05.758
and making future plans.

12:05.858 --> 12:08.260
That's actually, right now,
appealing to me.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.562
That's what I want in life.

12:09.628 --> 12:11.297
Anyways, I like this.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.765
This is nice.

12:12.865 --> 12:14.266
This is really just
a wonderful day.

12:14.366 --> 12:15.935
It is.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.140
Well, you asked me about
long-distance relationships.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.142
Uh-huh.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.610
I don't know
how I feel about them.

12:24.710 --> 12:27.113
I haven't had one,
really.

12:27.213 --> 12:29.782
- I'm willing to try.
- Okay, cool.

12:29.882 --> 12:31.283
We'll make it work,

12:31.383 --> 12:32.985
and then we'll figure out
things.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.127
Time to dance my way
downstairs.

12:41.227 --> 12:42.762
Dance.

12:44.964 --> 12:47.266
Go, go, go. Yes!

12:47.333 --> 12:50.302
Oh, we got a little shake.

12:51.804 --> 12:54.340
Mr. Brooks.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.478
Can you get me
some snacks?

12:59.578 --> 13:00.980
Yeah, I'll take
a couple waters,

13:01.080 --> 13:03.149
and then can we get
some chips?

13:03.249 --> 13:05.985
You got it.
I love it!

13:06.819 --> 13:08.587
I'm dying.
I hate this.

13:08.654 --> 13:10.956
This is not fun at all.

13:11.023 --> 13:12.825
- Wow, you did good.
- Yes!

13:12.925 --> 13:14.994
- Thank you, Mr. Brooke.
- You've earned a raise.

13:15.094 --> 13:16.162
- Just take one.
- Oh, yes.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.930
Oh, thank you.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.002
And one day he became
one of our district managers.

13:23.102 --> 13:24.670
One day we were having
a managers meeting,

13:24.770 --> 13:26.472
and we were talking about
giving people feedback.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.042
We're in trouble.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.479
Yes, you can.

13:36.282 --> 13:38.617
I will put a cover-up on.

13:38.684 --> 13:40.786
Hold that thought, Troy.

13:40.853 --> 13:42.788
Goodbye, Karen.

13:46.292 --> 13:48.027
Mm-hmm.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.897
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.466
Okay.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.080
Oh, wow, okay.

14:09.315 --> 14:11.016
Yeah. Okay.

14:12.151 --> 14:13.719
Okay.

14:13.819 --> 14:16.856
Okay, Breana -- what is
gonna happen with her?

14:19.225 --> 14:20.326
Okay.

14:20.392 --> 14:21.827
Some personal issues
came up for me,

14:21.894 --> 14:23.762
and I have to leave
the Second Chance Retreat.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.432
It is a bit upsetting,
and it's a little heartbreaking

14:26.532 --> 14:29.568
'cause I started to have
that connection with Troy.

14:29.668 --> 14:32.738
I can just hope the future holds
something for us,

14:32.838 --> 14:34.573
but I-I don't know.

14:36.508 --> 14:38.010
Yeah.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.412
Karen has just left
the Second Chance Retreat.

14:40.512 --> 14:44.350
And obviously,
that impacts me a lot.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.285
We certainly made
a great connection.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.722
And I'm actually
not sure what to do.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.791
Yeah.

14:57.363 --> 14:58.564
Yeah.

14:59.899 --> 15:03.135
My heart is, like,
falling into my stomach,

15:03.235 --> 15:04.970
I obviously didn't see
this one coming.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.083
Yeah.

15:24.456 --> 15:27.493
- Hi, guys.
- What up, Bre?

15:27.593 --> 15:29.828
This is, like,
such the hardest,

15:29.929 --> 15:31.563
butt I have to go.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.098
It's just -- it's just --

15:33.165 --> 15:35.467
the best for me and my family
right now.

15:42.908 --> 15:45.244
- Are you okay?
- I will be.

15:45.311 --> 15:46.679
I just want to
let you know, like,

15:46.779 --> 15:48.447
I'm really gonna, like,
miss all of you,

15:48.514 --> 15:52.484
and, like, you guys
are with family now and...

15:52.584 --> 15:54.520
- Hug it out?
- Oh.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.290
I just want Troy and Noah
to know

15:58.357 --> 16:00.025
that this has nothing
to do with them,

16:00.125 --> 16:03.195
that they're
the most amazing people.

16:03.295 --> 16:07.333
Troy is the most amazing man,
and maybe him and my mom

16:07.433 --> 16:10.102
could reconnect and continue it.

16:10.169 --> 16:11.337
This fucking sucks.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.205
Yeah, this fucking sucks.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.640
I'm really happy I came.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.642
I definitely learned
a little too much

16:16.709 --> 16:19.178
than I wanted to know
about my mom.

16:19.278 --> 16:20.512
I love you all.

16:20.612 --> 16:22.982
- We love you, too.
- It's gonna be okay.

16:23.048 --> 16:24.616
I love you, Bre.

16:24.683 --> 16:27.953
This just showed me that there
is love for people out there,

16:28.020 --> 16:30.389
not only in relationships,

16:30.489 --> 16:33.192
but also in friendships
and family.

16:33.292 --> 16:34.727
- Bye!
- Bye!

16:34.827 --> 16:37.062
- I'll miss your naps.
- I love you.

16:37.162 --> 16:40.699
I love you.
That sucks!

16:53.379 --> 16:54.880
I don't feel great

16:54.980 --> 16:57.716
that Bre had to leave
on such short notice,

16:57.816 --> 17:00.586
but my eyes were opened
a little bit.

17:00.686 --> 17:04.356
Right now, I know I definitely
have the courage to say

17:04.423 --> 17:05.891
how I feel about Alex.

17:05.991 --> 17:08.727
I mean, like the first night
we had a guy talk,

17:08.827 --> 17:10.729
they asked if we thought
any of you girls were cute.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.731
You and I said
you were my type

17:12.831 --> 17:14.767
and I thought
you were pretty cute.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.268
Aw.

17:32.117 --> 17:33.752
I don't like to admit it,

17:33.852 --> 17:36.255
but I feel a really
strong connection

17:36.355 --> 17:40.392
between Noah and myself.

17:45.931 --> 17:48.100
Alex, I really care
about you.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.102
like, a lot.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.270
Aw.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.439
Like, more than
I probably should.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.489
Hello, hello.
Are you there?

18:10.589 --> 18:12.624
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

18:12.724 --> 18:14.259
Please. I'm sorry.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.830
So, Trish and I -- we had
a lot of fun on our date.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.566
I can see she and I being
friends for a very long time,

18:20.632 --> 18:22.401
but Kiki and I have spent
some time together,

18:22.468 --> 18:24.470
and we seem to have
a really good relationship

18:24.570 --> 18:26.939
and laugh a lot,
so I'm not shying away.

18:27.005 --> 18:28.774
I did not come here to go
sit in a corner.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.976
I'm here to close the game,
and I'm gonna do it.

18:31.076 --> 18:33.278
I was so
in a meditative state.

18:33.345 --> 18:35.147
Oh, my goodness.
Our parents!

18:35.247 --> 18:37.082
Carlie, where are you?
It's happening.

18:37.149 --> 18:38.650
I'm coming.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.652
Family is something
that's very important

18:40.752 --> 18:42.488
to me as well.
And what do you look for?

18:42.588 --> 18:44.456
A big heart
and sense of humor.

18:44.523 --> 18:45.991
And, of course,
a good sense of humor,

18:46.091 --> 18:47.126
'cause I like to have fun.

18:47.192 --> 18:48.360
- Yeah.
- Like, I enjoy laughing.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.962
I enjoy being goofy,

18:50.028 --> 18:53.332
and I want to do that
without judgment, you know?

18:53.432 --> 18:54.700
Well, we will
get along just fine.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.635
No judgment, yeah.
No judgment, no judgment.

18:56.702 --> 18:58.203
He looks so engaged.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.805
I --

18:59.872 --> 19:01.840
Like, have you ever been
in a relationship

19:01.940 --> 19:03.308
or looked to build
a relationship

19:03.375 --> 19:04.776
with someone
long-distance before?

19:04.843 --> 19:06.445
'Cause I know
that I haven't.

19:06.512 --> 19:09.181
Long-distance relationships --
I've had a couple, yes.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.983
It almost forces you --
well, it does force you --

19:11.049 --> 19:13.852
to become friends first,
and that's powerful.

19:13.952 --> 19:15.287
That's where
everything hits,

19:15.354 --> 19:16.889
is that level
of friendship.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.057
- He seems so comfortable.
- Really, yeah.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.360
One of the things I want to know
from you is,

19:21.460 --> 19:24.029
have you ever dated
outside your race?

19:24.129 --> 19:26.965
I'm sorry.

19:27.032 --> 19:28.333
Yeah, I'm sorry.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.701
What are you...

19:29.801 --> 19:31.803
No, no, no, no, no.

19:31.870 --> 19:34.473
No, that's just funny.
No, well, my kids are mixed.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.908
- Okay.
- So, yes, yeah.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.143
Their mother is Black,
so, yes.

19:38.210 --> 19:39.678
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.680
Oh, my gosh!

19:43.148 --> 19:44.316
I love that.

19:44.383 --> 19:45.884
And I wasn't laughing
at the question.

19:45.984 --> 19:47.386
I was just kind of laughing
because it's like, well, yeah.

19:47.486 --> 19:48.754
You were like, been there,
done that.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.589
Yeah.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.391
And have children to prove it,
right.

19:52.491 --> 19:55.060
Yeah, not an issue.
Not an issue at all, yeah.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.062
Oh, my --
they're adorable!

19:57.162 --> 19:58.564
I love this!

19:58.664 --> 20:00.032
I love is for them.

20:00.098 --> 20:02.234
You get up on stage
and you're just tearing it up

20:02.334 --> 20:03.769
and just releasing
all this stuff.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.371
When you said, "tearing it up"
and you held your hand

20:06.438 --> 20:07.839
like, with a mic, so...

20:07.906 --> 20:09.074
Kind of holding the steal
right there.

20:09.174 --> 20:10.609
Oh, so you --
do you rap a little bit?

20:10.709 --> 20:12.411
- I did. I did. Yes.
- Ah!

20:12.511 --> 20:13.745
Yeah, yeah.

20:13.845 --> 20:14.947
You want to do a little
freestyle?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.381
I mean, well,
it's not freestyle.

20:16.448 --> 20:17.883
I have something already.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.918
- Oh, my God.
- I hope she doesn't make him.

20:20.018 --> 20:21.453
First of all, I don't --

20:21.553 --> 20:24.022
We gotta hear them both.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.425
So if she does,
wouldn't that be cool?

20:26.525 --> 20:27.426
Yes!

20:27.526 --> 20:29.261
What's my name?
Kiki Malone.

20:29.361 --> 20:31.730
Undiscovered talents
and now I been told.

20:31.797 --> 20:34.099
Been spittin'
since 12 years old.

20:34.199 --> 20:36.134
DMX when I'm vexin'.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.569
Lil' Kim when I wanna
throw a hex...

20:37.636 --> 20:38.904
Oh, you know this?
Hey!

20:38.971 --> 20:40.439
I'm a lyricist,
so serious.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.474
Make you stand up,
take notice, period.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.776
Everything I spit's
more fire.

20:44.876 --> 20:46.645
And like a streetcar,
I desire

20:46.745 --> 20:48.614
to be the best emcee
in the game,

20:48.714 --> 20:50.716
not for the money,
the love, or the fame.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.484
I'm on a roll, boo,
don't stop me now.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.785
Don't stop me now.

20:53.885 --> 20:55.454
There's a new sheriff --
sheriff in town,

20:55.554 --> 20:57.456
and it's about to go down.

20:57.556 --> 21:01.493
Both:
And it's about to go down,
and it's about to go down!

21:01.593 --> 21:04.296
- Nice! That's nice.
- Yeah.

21:04.396 --> 21:06.131
I'm never gonna remember
that much.

21:06.231 --> 21:09.968
Oh, my poor dad.
He's sweating right now.

21:10.068 --> 21:11.670
I don't even know.
I mean, it's been so long

21:11.770 --> 21:13.138
since I've done it,
but I'll...

21:13.238 --> 21:15.007
Let me think what I got.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.109
I'm nervous. Oh, my God.
I don't want to see this.

21:17.175 --> 21:19.678
Oh, my God. It's all right.
It's all right.

21:21.146 --> 21:22.314
Oh, there's so many
I used to have.

21:22.414 --> 21:23.649
Just -- okay.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.751
With a one, two,
I set it off with a new swing.

21:25.817 --> 21:28.120
Now in '21 I explode
as a new thing...

21:28.186 --> 21:31.189
No!

21:31.290 --> 21:34.192
smackin' the whack stuff
and damn, it gets ludicrous!

21:34.293 --> 21:36.128
But something
don't seem right to me.

21:36.194 --> 21:38.830
How'd that soft-punk white kid,
they call me me a wannabe.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.832
Oh.

21:40.932 --> 21:44.169
wearing starter jackets
and the baggy-ass jeans.

21:44.269 --> 21:46.505
Oh, my God!

21:46.605 --> 21:49.608
I don't fuck around, B,
I come with the real shit.

21:49.675 --> 21:52.344
- Okay! With the real shit.
- Exactly.

21:53.679 --> 21:56.682
- Oh, my God.

21:56.782 --> 21:59.685
- I love the passion!
- Oh, my God.

21:59.785 --> 22:02.287
It's okay, it's okay.
We're in this together.

22:02.354 --> 22:06.191
I don't think he's met anyone
who at least can, like,

22:06.291 --> 22:07.826
tap into that side of him.

22:07.893 --> 22:09.194
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:09.294 --> 22:12.898
I-I do definitely enjoy,
like, talking to you,

22:12.998 --> 22:16.201
and I can feel, like, this
energy and synergy between us.

22:16.301 --> 22:18.804
- Absolutely, yeah.
- That feels nice. Yeah.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.639
Well, this has been awesome.
This has been so good.

22:20.706 --> 22:22.140
- Yeah, I enjoyed that.
- So let's do it again.

22:22.207 --> 22:24.876
- Let's do it.
- All right. Great. All right.

22:24.976 --> 22:27.045
Grant is a little bit goofy
and fun,

22:27.145 --> 22:29.815
and that actually fills me
with joy.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.383
This is gonna be a good time.

22:31.483 --> 22:34.553
Seeing her with your
father made me really happy.

22:34.653 --> 22:36.054
Carlie:
Well, I love to hear that.

22:36.154 --> 22:37.556
Coming in,
I was nervous

22:37.656 --> 22:39.891
'cause it's like,
is it possible?

22:39.991 --> 22:41.393
Like, I would like
for it to be possible

22:41.493 --> 22:43.161
and I, like,
was rooting for it.

22:43.228 --> 22:44.996
But to actually see it
start to happen

22:45.063 --> 22:46.198
is kind of like,
oh, my God!

22:46.264 --> 22:47.833
- Exactly. And so organic.
- Yes.

22:47.899 --> 22:50.769
Like, he came
at the perfect time.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.571
Maybe we will be
stepsisters!

22:52.671 --> 22:53.872
Bro.

22:58.410 --> 22:59.945
Stephanie:
Karen leaving --

23:00.045 --> 23:03.915
I mean, I feel bad when
stuff like this happens.

23:04.015 --> 23:05.283
and, you know,
it's like --

23:05.384 --> 23:08.353
- Well, hello, hello, hello.
- Hello!

23:08.420 --> 23:10.555
Hey!
Nice to see everyone.

23:10.622 --> 23:12.057
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.092
All right, well, today we have
a special retreat

23:14.192 --> 23:15.694
releasing ritual planned.

23:15.761 --> 23:17.095
- Ooh!
- Yeah.

23:17.195 --> 23:18.897
And we have a change of clothing
for this activity,

23:18.964 --> 23:20.699
so if you wouldn't mind
getting changed

23:20.766 --> 23:22.267
and meeting our guide
outside.

23:22.367 --> 23:24.136
- Okay.
- Thank you.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.437
- You're welcome.
- All right.

23:25.537 --> 23:26.938
- You can get up now.
- Okay.

23:32.544 --> 23:34.980
- Whoa!
- Oh, hey.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.616
Check this out, all right?
Meddle time.

23:38.717 --> 23:41.787
"Today you can communicate
a one-word message

23:41.887 --> 23:45.724
to your parents in the form of
a sentiment stone."

23:45.791 --> 23:47.426
- What?
- Nice.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.628
"You must each now
select one word

23:49.728 --> 23:52.330
to guide your parents
on their journey to find love

23:52.431 --> 23:53.799
in the Second Chance Retreat.

23:53.899 --> 23:56.968
You will receive
a sacrifice save for this."

23:57.068 --> 23:58.837
So we're not gonna lose --
we're not losing anything.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.105
Yes!

24:00.172 --> 24:01.940
My dad is coming
into this house brand-new,

24:02.007 --> 24:03.842
no bonds already formed.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.477
He's just thrown in there.

24:05.577 --> 24:06.912
I'm gonna go with "Create"

24:06.978 --> 24:10.315
because I want my dad
to create opportunities

24:10.415 --> 24:12.184
with someone in the retreat.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.953
I'm gonna go with "Pounce,"

24:15.020 --> 24:17.022
just to, you know,
show some initiative.

24:17.122 --> 24:20.158
I think I'm going to go with
"Breathe."

24:20.258 --> 24:22.260
I want her to just have fun
and just

24:22.327 --> 24:24.463
exhale and take a breath

24:24.529 --> 24:26.331
and enjoy this journey.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.951
Hello, and welcome.
Thank you for being here.

24:46.017 --> 24:47.385
My name is Shaman Mundo,

24:47.486 --> 24:49.521
and I'll be conducting
today's releasing ceremony.

24:49.621 --> 24:51.456
- A shaman?
- They're releasing?

24:51.523 --> 24:53.725
Oh God, I hope this
doesn't get super emotional.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.327
- I know.
- I feel like it might.

24:55.393 --> 24:57.062
You may be asking yourself,
what is a shaman

24:57.162 --> 24:58.864
and what is
a releasing ceremony?

24:58.964 --> 25:01.633
A releasing ceremony is gonna be
an opportunity

25:01.700 --> 25:03.535
for me to create sacred space,

25:03.635 --> 25:06.304
for us to have
a vulnerable conversation.

25:06.371 --> 25:08.306
And then when we're open
in that space,

25:08.373 --> 25:11.243
it's gonna allow
healing energies of the world

25:11.343 --> 25:13.545
to heal you
on a subconscious level.

25:13.645 --> 25:16.014
So whoever is holding this
has the floor,

25:16.081 --> 25:17.315
and they're free to speak

25:17.382 --> 25:18.917
until they feel
that they've been heard.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.752
They look adorable
in those outfits.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.221
- I'm liking the fit.
- Yeah. It's a look.

25:23.321 --> 25:24.990
Shaman Mundo:
What about, at this retreat --

25:25.056 --> 25:29.594
how have you experienced love
at this retreat?

25:31.229 --> 25:34.232
For me, it's been
kind of comforting that

25:34.332 --> 25:37.669
I think I've been on the right
track with many things.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.404
You know, the way I do it
for others,

25:39.504 --> 25:41.373
with, like, my kids and stuff,
I'm looking for that

25:41.439 --> 25:44.009
to come back from somebody.

25:44.075 --> 25:45.510
You know, and I started to
feel that a little bit

25:45.577 --> 25:48.179
with someone here
who's not here now.

25:48.246 --> 25:51.850
And that felt comforting
and validating and special.

25:51.917 --> 25:54.920
It's nice to hear that you've
had that kind of

25:55.020 --> 25:58.690
romantic relationship,
or spark, in this cocoon.

25:58.757 --> 26:00.592
Look at you.
You're smiling.

26:00.692 --> 26:04.396
And it's that glimpse of hope
that there's people out there

26:04.462 --> 26:06.197
that speak what you speak

26:06.264 --> 26:09.467
and know what you know
and feel what you feel.

26:12.203 --> 26:14.973
I do hope my dad gets
another opportunity with Karen

26:15.073 --> 26:18.143
because I think that there was
definitely a connection.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.444
I think he's probably just
counting the seconds

26:19.544 --> 26:20.645
till he sees her again.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.114
- Meddle time!
- Meddle time!

26:23.214 --> 26:25.317
- What?
- Are you shitting me right now?

26:26.785 --> 26:28.219
Oh, shit.
It's the stones.

26:28.286 --> 26:29.955
I didn't know he was gonna
give them to them.

26:30.055 --> 26:31.623
'Cause then it doesn't
even seem like we said it.

26:31.723 --> 26:34.826
It seems like the spirits
are really...

26:34.926 --> 26:36.394
Yes, they're speaking.

26:36.461 --> 26:38.129
- That's actually dope as hell.
- That was a great idea.

26:38.229 --> 26:40.999
What might keep
you grounded and centered

26:41.099 --> 26:42.567
when you feel like you're lost

26:42.634 --> 26:44.569
is gonna be
an earth element of stone.

26:44.636 --> 26:49.608
I've given energetic reiki to
the gift that's in this basket.

26:49.674 --> 26:53.411
So I would like each of you
to stand up and grab the stone

26:53.478 --> 26:55.981
with your name on it,
go back to your seat,

26:56.081 --> 26:58.416
and just hold it
and meditate on the word.

27:03.855 --> 27:06.157
Oh, my God.

27:06.257 --> 27:07.325
Kiki?

27:07.425 --> 27:10.028
My stone says "Breathe,"
and the other day,

27:10.128 --> 27:14.132
I was<i> really</i> feeling
overwhelmed with emotion,

27:14.199 --> 27:18.003
and a good friend of mine
told me before I came here,

27:18.103 --> 27:20.505
"Just remember to breathe,"

27:20.605 --> 27:24.042
because my tendency is that
I get so filled with emotion,

27:24.142 --> 27:27.178
sometimes the fear overtakes me.

27:27.278 --> 27:29.648
Destiny:
Since the first day she came in,

27:29.714 --> 27:31.349
I could tell my mom
was wound up.

27:31.449 --> 27:34.185
She wasn't fully being herself
or having fun

27:34.285 --> 27:36.688
and really enjoying
this experience,

27:36.788 --> 27:40.859
and I wanted her
to just take a beat.

27:40.959 --> 27:43.995
Breathing gets me back
to center.

27:44.062 --> 27:46.231
This is my grounding tool.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.900
You know,
most people would think

27:49.000 --> 27:51.202
this is me,
that I'm a proud person.

27:51.302 --> 27:54.673
I've succeeded with having
my masculine energy

27:54.739 --> 27:57.308
and my feminine energy,
which is my soft side,

27:57.375 --> 27:58.376
never gets to come out.

27:58.476 --> 28:00.912
So I look at this "Proud"
and say,

28:01.012 --> 28:02.313
I have to be proud

28:02.380 --> 28:05.483
of my soft side,
my feminine energy.

28:05.550 --> 28:07.419
Yeah, she got the message.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.887
They're changing in here.

28:08.987 --> 28:10.989
The shit my mom just said,
I've never heard her say before,

28:11.056 --> 28:13.925
And she probably wouldn't have
said that unless for this.

28:14.025 --> 28:17.062
Well, I have "Chance"
on my stone.

28:17.162 --> 28:19.064
I also have Vegas
on my bucket list,

28:19.164 --> 28:22.701
so, you know, I'm a little
confused by this one.

28:24.836 --> 28:26.738
You know, for me,
I think it's --

28:26.838 --> 28:28.606
you know, take a chance,

28:28.707 --> 28:32.844
take a chance and break
out of my self-imposed prison

28:32.911 --> 28:36.281
created by fear
and take a chance on love,

28:36.381 --> 28:37.916
you know,
because I do deserve it.

28:38.016 --> 28:39.217
Mm-hmm.

28:39.284 --> 28:41.019
- I love your dad, Alex.
- He's so sweet.

28:41.086 --> 28:44.222
He has a lot of love to give.
He really is such a good man.

28:44.289 --> 28:46.458
But he's too hard on himself,
so I'm glad --

28:46.558 --> 28:49.461
it seems like he's really,
like, used this,

28:49.561 --> 28:51.863
like, to let go
and forgive himself.

28:51.930 --> 28:54.065
Yeah, yeah.

28:55.700 --> 28:57.602
- Hmm.
- "Time."

28:57.702 --> 28:59.437
I know that he's feeling
pretty down

28:59.537 --> 29:01.606
about the whole Karen situation,

29:01.706 --> 29:04.542
and my idea when I
put "Time" on that rock is,

29:04.609 --> 29:06.811
you know, it just --
it takes time,

29:06.911 --> 29:08.613
and things can't be rushed.

29:08.713 --> 29:10.782
But, you know, it'll work out.

29:10.882 --> 29:13.485
I think that this goes beyond
just taking the time for myself.

29:13.585 --> 29:17.088
This probably speaks to
what I'll do leaving here,

29:17.155 --> 29:19.290
what I've learned,
and maybe just,

29:19.390 --> 29:22.160
you know, making time
for someone else.

29:22.260 --> 29:25.296
Time.
Time is of the essence.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.165
I think with mine,
it's, um...

29:27.265 --> 29:29.134
I don't think
I've ever really thought

29:29.234 --> 29:30.301
I'm a strong woman.

29:30.401 --> 29:32.470
I know that I go every day
and do my --

29:32.570 --> 29:34.639
what I'm supposed to do,
be that independent mom

29:34.739 --> 29:36.608
and work,
and do the things.

29:36.674 --> 29:38.309
And I guess
I just never realized, like,

29:38.409 --> 29:40.311
I am -- I am strong.

29:40.411 --> 29:41.613
You are, Mom.

29:41.679 --> 29:43.982
I think it's
very important for my mom

29:44.082 --> 29:46.151
to realize how strong
she is as a woman

29:46.251 --> 29:48.353
and how much she's always
deserved to be loved

29:48.453 --> 29:51.589
and to get that confidence back
and believe in herself

29:51.656 --> 29:53.691
and believe that there's
an amazing person out there.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.661
I mean, to go through
what I've been through, and...

29:56.761 --> 29:58.329
So I-I love my rock.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.499
"I love my rock."
Aw!

30:04.269 --> 30:06.805
Okay, so I'm confused
by mine.

30:06.871 --> 30:07.972
Confused?

30:08.039 --> 30:09.174
Yes. "Caution."

30:09.274 --> 30:11.676
Ooh, caution. Nice.

30:13.111 --> 30:15.513
I chose "Caution"
because I feel like

30:15.613 --> 30:18.516
she is moving a little too fast,

30:18.616 --> 30:22.153
and I feel like she might need
to just slow down a little bit,

30:22.220 --> 30:23.688
take her time.

30:23.788 --> 30:25.723
Caution, in
my opinion, is circumstantial.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.025
Okay.

30:27.125 --> 30:29.194
Caution is just having
the situational awareness

30:29.294 --> 30:32.363
to know when to step on the gas
and when to step on the brake.

30:32.463 --> 30:34.232
Oh, well, come on.
I hear you.

30:36.067 --> 30:39.037
- That was clean.
- That was smooth as shit.

30:39.137 --> 30:40.505
Yeah, I'm fired up
about mine.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.073
Mine says "Create,"
which is what I do.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.842
I mean, that's what I do.
I create for, you know --

30:43.908 --> 30:46.010
things for people to help
their businesses or whatever.

30:46.077 --> 30:47.478
So this is awesome.

30:47.545 --> 30:49.180
And now that I'm only accepting
positive energy,

30:49.247 --> 30:51.749
I'm fired up, man, like
a racehorse in the gates, man.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.052
Let's get going.
Let's open the gates, baby.

30:54.152 --> 30:56.154
That's how he was supposed
to take it,

30:56.221 --> 30:57.755
not business, but...

30:57.856 --> 30:59.557
You know what?
You made him happy.

30:59.657 --> 31:00.825
Yeah.

31:00.892 --> 31:05.096
So my rock word
is "Pounce."

31:05.196 --> 31:07.265
- Ooh!
- Oh, that's good.

31:07.365 --> 31:08.766
- That's good.
- Yeah, yeah.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.235
That one was -- I don't know
if they were thinking,

31:10.335 --> 31:13.204
like, my thoughts,
but, you know,

31:13.271 --> 31:15.173
in the area of love,
I don't pounce.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.375
- Ah!
- Oh.

31:17.442 --> 31:21.212
I am much more pensive
and rational, and I delay,

31:21.279 --> 31:24.582
and I create roadblocks,
as I said, and I sabotage,

31:24.682 --> 31:26.618
whereas many other parts
of my life,

31:26.718 --> 31:29.220
it's more about pouncing,

31:29.287 --> 31:31.222
- Oh, he got it.
- Oh. Boom!

31:31.289 --> 31:33.725
He's like, other parts of
his life, he does pounce...

31:33.791 --> 31:35.693
Yeah, he's had a lot of success
when he does that.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.595
- He got it.
- So, okay, boom!

31:37.695 --> 31:39.764
- There you go. Good job, Brooks.
- Fuck yes!

31:39.864 --> 31:42.200
I hit the nail right on the head
with that one.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.270
So my rock word is "Urgency."

31:45.370 --> 31:46.905
- Urgency.
- Mm-hmm.

31:46.971 --> 31:49.107
Yeah, and the first thing that
popped in my mind was that song,

31:58.783 --> 32:00.485
He's so old.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.587
He's so...

32:02.654 --> 32:04.889
I-I don't know. Maybe you can
help me a little bit with it.

32:04.956 --> 32:06.457
- The time is now.
- The time is now.

32:06.557 --> 32:07.792
- The time is now.
- Right.

32:07.892 --> 32:09.427
I'm a person of destiny.

32:09.494 --> 32:11.829
There's zero mistake
of why you're here.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.498
So I'm thinking about
where I am right now

32:13.598 --> 32:16.834
in relation to, you know,
the women that are here now.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.972
But I'm not sensing
any romantic feelings,

32:21.072 --> 32:23.074
and we still have time,
and I'm hopeful

32:23.141 --> 32:25.743
that the opportunity
is still there for me.

32:25.810 --> 32:27.478
- That's what...
- Homeboy drives it home, dude.

32:27.578 --> 32:29.981
It's almost like he's reading us
through the screen.

32:30.081 --> 32:31.416
- Right?

32:31.482 --> 32:34.419
And so thank you.
I'm honored that you guys shared

32:34.485 --> 32:36.654
and helped -- and grew with me
in this place.

32:36.754 --> 32:38.589
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

32:38.656 --> 32:40.825
- I'm so proud.
- I just wonder how much of this

32:40.925 --> 32:42.427
they're actually gonna,
like, retain

32:42.493 --> 32:44.028
and try to implement in their,
like, day-to-day lives.

32:44.128 --> 32:45.363
- I think they really will.
- I think.

32:45.463 --> 32:46.831
'Cause this is
a very unique experience,

32:46.931 --> 32:48.032
and I think
it will be retained.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.667
- Yeah.
- It really was.

32:49.767 --> 32:52.670
That concludes the ceremony.
What questions do you have?

32:52.770 --> 32:54.038
When can I see you again?

32:55.640 --> 32:58.309
Where are you at, brother?
I'm coming to find you,

32:58.376 --> 33:00.178
'cause I got time, man.

33:21.132 --> 33:23.201
Troy:
So I got a letter from Karen,

33:23.301 --> 33:25.536
and going through
a lot of emotions.

33:25.636 --> 33:28.373
"Troy, just as we were
starting to get close,

33:28.473 --> 33:30.174
life throws us a curve ball.

33:30.241 --> 33:32.577
I have to leave
for personal reasons.

33:32.677 --> 33:33.845
I hope for us to get together

33:33.911 --> 33:35.880
and continue
to explore our connection

33:35.980 --> 33:37.815
and see what the future
holds for us.

33:37.882 --> 33:41.052
I leave you with my heart.
Love, K."

33:41.152 --> 33:43.721
I am sad and angry

33:43.821 --> 33:46.657
and frustrated and confused,

33:46.724 --> 33:49.727
and, you know, a lot of --
a lot of mixed emotions.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.014
- Hey, guys.
- Hi!

34:10.081 --> 34:11.115
Hey!

34:11.215 --> 34:12.750
I just want to
tell you guys something.

34:12.850 --> 34:14.619
- Nothing bad, I hope.
- Yeah.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.254
- Yeah.
- Come on.

34:16.354 --> 34:18.756
I mean, it's no secret that
Karen and I had a connection.

34:18.856 --> 34:21.759
And so her not being here,

34:21.859 --> 34:26.631
doesn't, uh, make much sense
for me to stick around.
