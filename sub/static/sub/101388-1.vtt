WEBVTT

00:58.917 --> 01:00.285
Katie Sharp.

01:00.318 --> 01:03.655
Will she be the new
face of Glam Slam's?

01:13.732 --> 01:14.700
Cassandra, I'm ready.

01:14.733 --> 01:16.402
Just a minute.

01:16.435 --> 01:19.340
You have
to go to school!

01:53.909 --> 01:56.879
♪ Dear baby bird ♪

01:56.912 --> 01:59.682
♪ Dear sparrow ♪

02:02.451 --> 02:04.221
That was beautiful, honey.

02:04.253 --> 02:06.556
Juilliard would be
crazy not to enroll you.

02:06.589 --> 02:08.759
Mom, I can't do it,
I'm so stressed out.

02:08.791 --> 02:10.427
You can do it.

02:10.461 --> 02:11.829
You earned this
because you sent them

02:11.861 --> 02:13.463
an incredible audition.

02:13.497 --> 02:14.798
Ok, but that was a recording

02:14.831 --> 02:17.434
and I can't have a music
career behind a curtain.

02:17.468 --> 02:18.737
We're working on it.

02:18.769 --> 02:20.772
I almost got the curtain open.

02:20.804 --> 02:23.708
I'll be the only person in
the symphony that's in a box.

02:23.742 --> 02:25.777
People gonna say, oh who's
the amazing guitarist

02:25.809 --> 02:26.844
in the box?

02:26.878 --> 02:28.512
You're not gonna be in a box.

02:28.546 --> 02:30.483
It's just stage fright.

02:30.516 --> 02:31.851
Yeah, but it feels
like I'm gonna throw up.

02:31.883 --> 02:34.654
Like my stomach is
turning inside out.

02:34.686 --> 02:36.922
Your talent's too
beautiful not to share.

02:36.956 --> 02:40.359
It's a gift trying
to erupt out of you.

02:40.393 --> 02:45.233
Yeah, but it won't be the
only thing erupting out of me.

02:46.532 --> 02:48.768
Oh I have
to work late tonight.

02:48.801 --> 02:51.271
Clay will pick you up
or you can take the bus.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.039
Thats humiliating.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.440
I'm a junior.

02:53.472 --> 02:55.810
And good thing New
York has subways,

02:55.842 --> 02:58.545
you won't have to worry
about driving or a car.

02:58.579 --> 03:03.418
Oh we are gonna miss you so
much when you go to Juilliard.

03:04.151 --> 03:07.590
Don't worry, at this rate
I won't be going anyway.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.057
Thousands of people
audition for Julliard

03:09.091 --> 03:10.725
and only a handful get in.

03:10.759 --> 03:15.064
Besides if I don't get the
scholarship, I can't go anyway.

03:15.097 --> 03:18.368
Just have to join Clay
at the community college.

03:18.401 --> 03:20.771
Hey, don't knock
community college.

03:20.803 --> 03:22.473
You'll get it, Cass.

03:25.808 --> 03:27.410
Honey, I wish you
could play with your heart,

03:27.444 --> 03:28.744
not your head.

03:28.778 --> 03:30.548
Then it wouldn't
matter who's watching.

03:30.581 --> 03:33.318
You don't have
to be psych-ward mom right now.

03:33.350 --> 03:35.586
I'm a nurse,
not a therapist,

03:35.618 --> 03:39.423
but I'll give you a
penny for your thoughts.

03:39.457 --> 03:41.861
Cassandra, you're spin cycling.

03:44.929 --> 03:46.731
I wanna be someone else.

03:46.764 --> 03:48.900
Why, that breaks my heart.

03:48.934 --> 03:49.969
Who would you be?

03:50.001 --> 03:52.838
Someone who can play a
guitar in front of people.

03:52.870 --> 03:55.407
Someone who can drive and
actually have a license.

03:55.441 --> 03:57.811
Honey, you can get your
license whenever you want.

03:57.844 --> 03:59.478
Whenever you're ready.

03:59.512 --> 04:02.514
Someone who can pay for
college, and who is popular

04:02.548 --> 04:04.017
that everyone likes.

04:05.853 --> 04:08.323
with millions of followers.

04:10.490 --> 04:11.758
I wanna be like Katie Sharp.

04:11.792 --> 04:13.426
What?

04:13.460 --> 04:14.628
She has everything.

04:14.660 --> 04:19.067
She's popular, she's beautiful
and confident in her life.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.902
Her life is perfect.

04:21.935 --> 04:24.406
Isn't she one
of the mean girls?

04:24.439 --> 04:25.074
Yeah.

04:25.908 --> 04:28.710
I wanna be her, I don't
wanna be like her.

04:28.742 --> 04:29.779
I hate Katie Sharp.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.880
We don't hate people.

04:31.914 --> 04:34.916
Besides, you don't wanna
be one of the brad pack.

04:34.950 --> 04:37.854
And, honey, Katie Sharp
doesn't have everything.

04:37.887 --> 04:40.456
Mom, she is everything.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.093
I bet there are things you
have that Katie would want.

04:43.126 --> 04:45.729
She just needs to get
to know you, that's all.

04:45.761 --> 04:46.763
Yeah, like what?

04:46.797 --> 04:49.734
Well, you have
a beautiful heart.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.668
Well, everyone likes her.

04:52.701 --> 04:54.405
Did you hear what I just said?

04:54.438 --> 04:56.540
You need to love others
as you love yourself.

04:56.574 --> 04:57.709
Yes, Mom, I know.

04:57.741 --> 04:59.143
As you love yourself.

04:59.176 --> 05:02.046
That's the heart of the matter.

05:02.079 --> 05:03.781
Okay, I'm sorry.

05:03.815 --> 05:06.452
It's just everyone always
talks about Katie Sharp.

05:06.484 --> 05:11.490
Well, maybe You should talk
to her instead of about her.

05:42.557 --> 05:43.158
Bye.

05:43.191 --> 05:44.760
Bye.

05:44.792 --> 05:45.593
love You.

05:45.627 --> 05:46.427
love You.

05:46.461 --> 05:49.098
Oh honey, you
forgot your coffee!

05:50.564 --> 05:51.165
Thanks, Mom.

05:51.199 --> 05:53.736
How will we live today?

05:53.769 --> 05:55.805
Lead with love.

05:55.837 --> 05:57.606
Oh, your shoe is untied.

05:57.640 --> 05:58.474
Mom?

06:11.188 --> 06:11.889
Yes, you got it.

06:16.025 --> 06:16.826
Look at her.

06:16.859 --> 06:18.796
Oh, no, oh poor girl.

06:19.764 --> 06:22.234
She looks like she got
her clothes from the dump.

06:22.267 --> 06:24.168
She should start
a GoFundMe campaign.

06:24.202 --> 06:25.170
Oh I would donate.

06:25.202 --> 06:28.072
Actually it's an idea
for video I wanna do.

06:28.106 --> 06:29.708
Kids who forgot to
look in the mirror

06:29.741 --> 06:30.977
before they leave the house.

06:31.010 --> 06:32.078
That sounds good.

06:32.111 --> 06:32.945
I know.

06:34.212 --> 06:37.917
Oh Olivia looks so ditzy
in that short uniform.

06:37.950 --> 06:38.851
- Hello.
- I know.

06:38.883 --> 06:39.919
Hi.

06:41.186 --> 06:42.689
Did you guys see my blog

06:42.721 --> 06:44.591
on this new jewelry
line I discovered?

06:44.624 --> 06:45.792
No, I must have
missed that one.

06:45.824 --> 06:46.959
I'm sorry.

06:46.992 --> 06:48.629
Oh, I forgot my lab binder.

06:48.661 --> 06:49.262
I'll be right back.

06:49.295 --> 06:51.197
Yeah, okay.

06:51.230 --> 06:53.902
Literally nobody
reads her blog.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.770
She just really
wants to be like you.

06:55.803 --> 06:58.907
Yeah, but I hope that
jacket's not real leather.

06:58.940 --> 06:59.741
Hey, babe.

06:59.774 --> 07:00.809
Hi, Hayden.

07:00.842 --> 07:02.777
So I was thinking maybe
you could make a video

07:02.810 --> 07:04.212
about me being your boyfriend.

07:04.245 --> 07:05.781
You know, like me working out.

07:05.814 --> 07:06.982
Throwing the ball around.

07:07.014 --> 07:08.082
That sounds riveting.

07:08.115 --> 07:08.917
I'll think about it.

07:08.951 --> 07:10.720
Yeah, yeah, cool.

07:13.287 --> 07:15.857
Is he still trying to
be in one of your videos?

07:15.891 --> 07:17.025
Like what cloud chaser.

07:17.059 --> 07:22.132
I dated him because he's hot
nor to get him followers.

07:22.164 --> 07:23.165
Hi, Katie.

07:24.033 --> 07:26.870
Hey, I just wanted to wish you
luck on your Glam Slam job.

07:26.902 --> 07:31.808
Because that's so cool and you
might already have a career.

07:34.979 --> 07:37.348
These are designer shoes.

07:37.381 --> 07:39.750
Oh my gosh, are you okay?

07:39.782 --> 07:40.785
Yeah.

07:40.818 --> 07:41.887
Let me help you clean them.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.689
Don't touch me.

07:43.721 --> 07:45.858
Sorry, it was just trying.

07:47.625 --> 07:48.859
You can wear my shoes.

07:48.892 --> 07:50.194
I know we wear the
same size shoes.

07:50.228 --> 07:52.064
because I watched your
favorite shoes videos...

07:52.096 --> 07:52.931
Stalker!

07:54.299 --> 07:58.136
I wouldn't be caught
dead in your shoes.

07:58.169 --> 08:00.640
Looks like someone forgot
to look in the mirror

08:00.673 --> 08:02.875
when they left the house.

08:02.907 --> 08:06.112
We don't wanna see your
face for the rest of the day.

08:06.146 --> 08:07.915
Or your ugly shoes.

08:35.243 --> 08:37.345
Did you wake up in
some alternate universe

08:37.378 --> 08:39.314
where we are friends
with Katie Sharp?

08:39.347 --> 08:40.882
I was trying to be nice.

08:40.915 --> 08:41.785
Okay, kids.

08:41.818 --> 08:44.087
Last time we talked
about saprotrophs

08:44.119 --> 08:47.123
and how they help the
process of decomposition.

08:47.156 --> 08:50.192
Decomposition is an important
part of the life cycle.

08:50.225 --> 08:53.062
The change that one living
organism has on another,

08:53.095 --> 08:55.265
creates room for new life.

08:55.298 --> 08:57.968
As you see here, I
have beakers of milk

08:58.002 --> 08:59.370
and they all have
different dates

08:59.402 --> 09:02.840
and are in various
stages of decomposition.

09:02.873 --> 09:04.742
Yeah, very unpleasant.

09:04.774 --> 09:08.079
So can anyone tll me,
why does milk spoil?

09:09.914 --> 09:10.915
Katie Sharp!

09:13.751 --> 09:18.758
Because you don't have it
in a refrigerator.

09:19.358 --> 09:21.126
Who cares about
being nice to her?

09:21.159 --> 09:22.962
Love your neighbor.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.364
She lives on the
other side of town.

09:24.396 --> 09:26.932
She's not your neighbor.

09:26.966 --> 09:28.268
Cassandra Evans?

09:29.870 --> 09:32.405
The saprotrophs in
the milk are bacteria.

09:32.439 --> 09:33.473
They're eating the milk.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.943
It's their waste that
makes the milk smell bad.

09:35.976 --> 09:36.910
That is correct.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.045
Good job, Cassandra.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.281
Kids, if you're gonna be
distracted in my class,

09:41.314 --> 09:42.817
you better at least
have the right answer

09:42.850 --> 09:45.152
when I call on you.

09:58.901 --> 09:59.736
Oh boy.

10:04.406 --> 10:05.942
How's guitar practice?

10:05.976 --> 10:08.778
Don't remind me, the
audition is coming up so soon.

10:08.812 --> 10:11.948
So I'm really freaked out.

10:11.981 --> 10:16.453
Want me to come over
tonight, be your audience?

10:17.321 --> 10:19.758
Maybe I should
apologize to Katie again.

10:19.790 --> 10:20.758
What?

10:20.792 --> 10:22.160
Do not talk to Katie Sharp

10:22.193 --> 10:24.129
- They're coming.
- or the brad pack.

10:24.161 --> 10:25.896
The last thing
you need right now

10:25.929 --> 10:28.866
is draw more
attention to yourself.

10:34.906 --> 10:36.107
Bro, no way!

10:36.141 --> 10:37.410
No way.

10:40.279 --> 10:42.015
Oh, she's.

10:42.047 --> 10:43.316
Oh, no, no, no.

10:49.388 --> 10:50.224
Oh man.

10:52.257 --> 10:54.061
I can't really handle it.

10:54.094 --> 10:55.864
It smells like pig.

11:05.306 --> 11:07.810
I hate her so much.

11:07.842 --> 11:10.578
I despise them all Cassandra.

11:10.611 --> 11:13.182
She is not gonna
get away with this.

11:13.215 --> 11:16.018
No, we shouldn't hate people.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.021
I said despise.

11:20.456 --> 11:24.127
Here, I scavenged these
from lost and found.

11:37.940 --> 11:39.475
I'm going to the
principal right now.

11:39.508 --> 11:40.911
No, no, please.

11:44.581 --> 11:46.851
It'll only make it worse.

11:48.585 --> 11:49.421
It's over.

12:17.451 --> 12:19.921
Let's go.

12:19.953 --> 12:22.222
Sis, I'm so sorry.

12:22.256 --> 12:23.658
I don't want to talk about it.

12:23.690 --> 12:25.626
High school kids are so mean.

12:25.660 --> 12:29.297
I can't believe they
did that to you.

12:29.330 --> 12:31.566
Wait, how'd you
know what happened?

12:31.599 --> 12:33.134
I watched it.
