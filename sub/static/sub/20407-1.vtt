08:08.009 --> 08:09.809
those people get more respect.

08:09.877 --> 08:11.645
You should start thinking
about plating up now.

08:11.712 --> 08:13.480
(Man)
Yes, Chef!
<i>15 seconds, ladies.</i>

08:13.547 --> 08:15.582
Plates, plates--where do
you guys keep plates?

08:15.650 --> 08:17.951
<i>Five...</i>
Taste my food.

08:18.019 --> 08:19.286
<i>Four...</i>
<i>(Man)</i>
<i>Ooh, I like it.</i>

08:19.353 --> 08:21.254
<i>Three, two,</i>

08:21.322 --> 08:22.856
<i>one.</i>

08:22.923 --> 08:24.891
<i>And stop.</i>
Ah!

08:28.763 --> 08:31.131
(Announcer)
Once again, Chef Ramsay
has divided the teams

08:31.198 --> 08:32.832
into men versus women,

08:32.900 --> 08:35.902
and their first challenge
is signature dish.

08:35.970 --> 08:37.871
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Okay, over the last 45 minutes,</i>

08:37.938 --> 08:39.105
<i>i seriously hope you were</i>
<i>thinking about</i>

08:39.173 --> 08:40.573
<i>what you saw</i>
<i>this morning, yes?</i>

08:40.640 --> 08:42.207
<i>Oh, by the way,</i>
<i>one more thing to tell you.</i>

08:42.275 --> 08:44.344
<i>The salary for the head Chef</i>

08:44.412 --> 08:47.013
at the la market...

08:47.081 --> 08:49.549
$250,000.

08:49.617 --> 08:54.387
Hell, yeah!
This is awesome.

08:54.455 --> 08:56.022
I definitely gotta win
Hell's Kitchen.

08:56.090 --> 08:57.824
I have to.

08:57.892 --> 08:59.693
Let's go.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.901
Wow.

09:07.968 --> 09:09.969
E go
any further...

09:10.037 --> 09:12.138
Would you mind just sort of
covering your puppies

09:12.206 --> 09:14.207
<i>just a little bit?</i>
Sorry, Chef.

09:14.275 --> 09:16.142
Yeah, I'm a little bit
boob-alicious.

09:16.210 --> 09:18.745
Gotta give
what the DNA gave me.

09:18.813 --> 09:20.647
But this is my favorite
date outfit.

09:20.715 --> 09:22.515
It usually does well.

09:22.583 --> 09:24.417
Would you mind
just putting it on,

09:24.485 --> 09:26.252
<i>in case something pops out?</i>
<i>Excellent.</i>

09:26.320 --> 09:28.121
Hi!
These are my boobs.

09:28.189 --> 09:29.189
Let's cook!

09:29.256 --> 09:30.690
Are you for real?

09:30.758 --> 09:32.392
<i>Okay, first name is?</i>
I'm Emily.

09:32.460 --> 09:33.927
What is it?

09:33.994 --> 09:35.929
A duck breast with a grape
and Walnut compote.

09:42.436 --> 09:43.803
That's nice.

09:43.871 --> 09:45.672
Thank you.
Cooked perfectly.

09:45.740 --> 09:47.107
Hopefully, he'll remember
my duck breast

09:47.174 --> 09:48.641
and not my human breast.

09:48.709 --> 09:50.643
Okay, big man.
First name is?

09:50.711 --> 09:51.911
Russell.

09:51.979 --> 09:53.279
I'm very confident
in my abilities.

09:53.347 --> 09:55.382
I bring the technical aspect,

09:55.449 --> 09:57.117
and I don't want to sound
overconfident,

09:57.184 --> 09:58.651
but I have a great chance
to win.

09:58.719 --> 10:00.320
<i>What is it?</i>
I have a...

10:00.388 --> 10:02.722
Grilled calamari steak
with a little salsa Verde.

10:02.790 --> 10:04.891
And the calamari,
is it normally that pink

10:04.959 --> 10:07.861
<i>in terms of undercooked?</i>
<i>I like mine mid-rare.</i>

10:07.928 --> 10:10.230
In terms of what
you serve in the restaurant,

10:10.297 --> 10:11.297
is it served
that undercooked?
It's served exactly like that.

10:11.365 --> 10:13.099
I mean, come on.

10:13.167 --> 10:14.701
You're supposed to be bringing
your a-game,

10:14.769 --> 10:16.736
for crying out loud.

10:16.804 --> 10:20.740
<i>Mmm.</i>
<i>Calamari's slightly dense.</i>

10:20.808 --> 10:24.244
<i>In terms of delivery,</i>
<i>it hits the mark.</i>

10:24.311 --> 10:25.712
It's nice.
Thank you.

10:25.780 --> 10:27.647
Okay. Tough choice.

10:27.715 --> 10:30.250
<i>Congratulations...</i>

10:30.317 --> 10:32.719
To you both.
1-1.

10:32.787 --> 10:35.021
(Announcer)
Never before in the history
of <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>

10:35.089 --> 10:37.924
has Chef Ramsay enjoyed
the first two signature dishes.

10:37.992 --> 10:41.294
Next two.
Now, sous Chef n Atlanta..

10:41.362 --> 10:43.663
Let's go!
And line cook vinny
from Queens

10:43.731 --> 10:45.632
are hoping the trend
continues.

10:45.699 --> 10:47.033
Okay.
Ladies first.

10:47.101 --> 10:49.135
This is fried chicken
with asparagus.

10:49.203 --> 10:51.771
I'm from the South.
That's what we do--we fry stuff.

10:51.839 --> 10:54.741
And there's nothing more
Southern than fried chicken.

10:54.809 --> 10:57.911
And what's the secret?
I throw all the herbs
in the oil first

10:57.978 --> 10:59.379
and infuse the oil.

10:59.447 --> 11:00.480
And the asparagus.
Simple sautee.

11:00.548 --> 11:01.581
Salt and pepper.

11:01.649 --> 11:02.582
<i>Wow.</i>

11:06.053 --> 11:08.221
<i>Did you forget</i>
<i>to cook the asparagus?</i>
No.

11:08.289 --> 11:10.590
I'm glad you find it funny,
sweet.

11:10.658 --> 11:12.692
Can you imagine if 100 diners
were cutting into that?

11:12.760 --> 11:14.327
No chance.

11:17.531 --> 11:19.065
<i>Why's it so sweet?</i>

11:19.133 --> 11:21.034
'Cause I put honey on it.
<i>Wow.</i>

11:21.101 --> 11:23.970
What a disaster.
Okay, next.

11:24.038 --> 11:25.271
Hello, Chef.
I'm vinny.

11:25.339 --> 11:27.207
From Queens
are very...

11:27.274 --> 11:28.741
People from Queens.

11:28.809 --> 11:30.643
These are
boiled poached halibut.

11:30.711 --> 11:32.946
If you cross me,
be prepared to be humiliated.

11:33.013 --> 11:34.948
What is that?

11:35.015 --> 11:36.850
That's some of the oil
from the halibut.

11:36.917 --> 11:38.384
You sure it's oil

11:38.452 --> 11:40.453
and not something
dripping out your hair

11:40.521 --> 11:41.921
from a product?

11:41.989 --> 11:43.823
If you're gonna
step on my shoes,

11:43.891 --> 11:45.425
be prepared to have me
bite your [Bleep] Toes off.

11:45.493 --> 11:47.861
Would you normally serve
a liter of oil?

11:47.928 --> 11:49.329
I think it tastes nice.

11:52.766 --> 11:54.601
I have a big problem
with this dish.

11:54.668 --> 11:56.169
I was totally praying to God,

11:56.237 --> 11:57.704
and I'm not even
that religious.

11:57.771 --> 12:01.975
It looks...Horrific.

12:02.042 --> 12:03.743
[Exhales]

12:03.811 --> 12:07.247
However, the fish...
Actually tastes quite nice.

12:07.314 --> 12:08.681
<i>Nicely seasoned.</i>

12:08.749 --> 12:11.951
Definitely a no, no, no,
no for nona.

12:12.019 --> 12:14.087
One to the boys.

12:14.154 --> 12:15.455
Looks like there's clouds
parting on the horizon.

12:15.523 --> 12:16.890
Well done.

12:16.957 --> 12:19.058
It's sort of like a little
under the cover "yeah."

12:19.126 --> 12:20.727
Next, please.

12:20.794 --> 12:22.495
With the men leading
by one point,

12:22.563 --> 12:24.631
the women are counting
on line cook antonia

12:24.698 --> 12:27.500
to even the score.

12:27.568 --> 12:29.302
Okay, what's under there?

12:29.370 --> 12:30.637
But one member
of the red team...
[yawns]

12:30.704 --> 12:32.305
Seems to be losing interest.

12:32.373 --> 12:35.375
Excuse me two seconds.
First name--what is it?

12:35.442 --> 12:36.809
Um, Sabrina.

12:36.877 --> 12:38.311
Are you bored?
No, Chef.

12:38.379 --> 12:40.446
You are.
No. No, I'm not bored, Chef.

12:40.514 --> 12:42.315
You were yawning.

12:42.383 --> 12:43.716
The girl at the end
of the line, Sabrina,

12:43.784 --> 12:44.784
starts yawning.

12:44.852 --> 12:46.553
There's a door there.

12:46.620 --> 12:48.288
Oh, that can't be good
for our team.

12:48.355 --> 12:49.422
That cannot be good
for our team.

12:49.490 --> 12:50.890
Will you go now?

12:50.958 --> 12:52.792
(Lisa)
She's gonna go.
Absolutely.

12:52.860 --> 12:54.961
Me, I don't give a [Bleep].

12:55.029 --> 12:56.362
I don't give a rat's ass.

12:56.430 --> 12:58.531
You joke and [Bleep] Aand yaw.

12:58.599 --> 13:00.433
Oh, my God, what did I do?

13:00.501 --> 13:01.501
I'm tired of this!

13:03.000 --> 13:09.074

13:10.225 --> 13:11.825
(Announcer)
In the signature dish challenge,

13:11.893 --> 13:13.427
the women are down
2 to 1,

13:13.495 --> 13:15.429
and on top of that...
<i>Excuse me two seconds.</i>

13:15.497 --> 13:17.197
Sabrina...
Are you bored?

13:17.265 --> 13:19.433
No, I'm not bored, Chef.
You were yawning.

13:19.501 --> 13:21.735
Isn't scoring any points
with Chef Ramsay.

13:21.803 --> 13:23.670
There's a door there.
Will you go now?

13:23.738 --> 13:25.606
Me, I don't give a [Bleep].

13:25.673 --> 13:27.107
You joke and [Bleep] Around
and yawn...

13:31.212 --> 13:33.247
There ya go.

13:33.314 --> 13:35.249
Sit down and rest
your weary legs.

13:35.316 --> 13:37.217
<i>Thank you, baby Spice.</i>
<i>You look very cozy there.</i>

13:37.285 --> 13:40.687
<i>Would you like a drink?</i>

13:40.755 --> 13:42.790
I'm okay.

13:42.857 --> 13:45.392
Haven't even tasted your food.
Already, I'm pissed with you.

13:45.460 --> 13:47.127
I got tired.
I don't care.

13:47.195 --> 13:49.963
I'm not scared of you,
Chef Ramsay, I'm not.

13:50.031 --> 13:52.199
2 to 1. Okay.
What is it?

13:52.267 --> 13:54.234
It's a mardi gras gumbo.

13:54.302 --> 13:56.236
<i>Oh, God! Does it</i>
<i>normally look like</i>

13:56.304 --> 13:58.572
<i>a plate of liquid [Bleep]?</i>
No.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.442
Every time I make my gumbo,
it always gets eaten

14:01.509 --> 14:03.911
and everybody loves it.
<i>Hmm.</i>

14:03.978 --> 14:06.713
It's gonna be good.

14:06.781 --> 14:08.482
[Belches]
Oh. 'Scuse me.

14:10.552 --> 14:12.186
[Bleep]!

14:12.253 --> 14:13.720
[Whispers]
Oh, God.

14:13.788 --> 14:16.990
Are you crazy?
Have you tasted that?

14:17.058 --> 14:19.460
No, I didn't get a chance
to taste it, Chef.

14:19.527 --> 14:21.295
[Belches, gags]

14:21.362 --> 14:23.363
So you cooked it,
and you didn't even taste it.

14:23.431 --> 14:24.731
<i>I didn't have</i>
<i>enough time.</i>

14:24.799 --> 14:26.467
I'm so sorry
you don't like it.

14:26.534 --> 14:28.035
N't <i>like</i> it?

14:28.102 --> 14:29.970
I'm sorry
it wasn't up to par.

14:30.038 --> 14:31.605
Up to par?
It's inedible!

14:31.673 --> 14:33.674
Okay.
Then throw it out.

14:33.741 --> 14:35.876
No. I'm not gonna
throw it out.

14:35.944 --> 14:38.011
G man.
Yes, sir.

14:38.079 --> 14:40.714
You like your food.
Take a mouthful.

14:40.782 --> 14:41.648
Pass it along.

14:41.716 --> 14:43.717
It was completel

14:43.785 --> 14:45.586
I would have rather had

14:45.653 --> 14:47.387
a cat [Bleep] In my mouth

14:47.455 --> 14:48.655
than have eaten that
any further.

14:48.723 --> 14:50.724
Oh...[bleep].

14:52.327 --> 14:53.594
Oh, my God.

14:53.661 --> 14:58.198
I don't even know
how to explain that.

14:58.266 --> 14:59.733
<i>Vinny, what was that</i>
<i>tasting like?</i>

14:59.801 --> 15:01.134
Like a big bowl of mud.

15:04.506 --> 15:06.139
<i>Dear, oh, dear.</i>

15:06.207 --> 15:07.641
<i>Young man,</i>
<i>first name is?</i>
Curtis.

15:07.709 --> 15:09.176
Where did you study?
Apprenticeship schools.

15:09.244 --> 15:10.811
<i>Had a great opportunity</i>

15:10.879 --> 15:13.480
move up to executive Chef.
Blow me away.

15:13.548 --> 15:15.249
Looks like a pair
of wings.

15:15.316 --> 15:17.684
It's actually a lemon
pepper chicken, Chef.

15:21.556 --> 15:23.457
It's [Bleep].
Yes, Chef.

15:23.525 --> 15:25.092
<i>Piss off, both of you.</i>
<i>No points.</i>

15:25.159 --> 15:26.860
There goes the balloon
to my parade.

15:26.928 --> 15:28.095
Puuuh!

15:28.162 --> 15:29.763
Next two.

15:32.467 --> 15:36.904
<i>Right, uh...</i>

15:36.971 --> 15:39.606
<i>Did you singe them off?</i>
<i>No. I got them tattooed on.</i>

15:42.944 --> 15:44.444
Show me.

15:44.512 --> 15:46.513
<i>Wow. What is it?</i>

15:46.581 --> 15:48.181
It's an herb and vegetable
stuffed chicken

15:48.249 --> 15:49.750
with a herb cream sauce.

15:51.553 --> 15:54.655
Yeah. Actually tastes
quite delicious.

15:54.722 --> 15:56.456
Thank you, Chef.
Good for her.

15:56.524 --> 15:58.258
You can't judge a book
by the eyebrows.

15:58.326 --> 15:59.793
You know,
she has some talent there.

15:59.861 --> 16:02.563
Okay, what is it?
I got a pistachio crusted

16:02.630 --> 16:03.697
Colorado rack of lamb.

16:03.765 --> 16:05.732
No way possible

16:05.800 --> 16:07.634
that Chef Ramsay will not
like my signature dish.

16:07.702 --> 16:08.635
He's gonna ask me
for the recipe,

16:08.703 --> 16:10.437
and I might give it to him.

16:10.505 --> 16:12.039
We'll see.

16:12.106 --> 16:13.674
Did you take a bite
of that?

16:13.741 --> 16:15.175
I did not.

16:15.243 --> 16:16.743
Is it normally
served that raw?

16:16.811 --> 16:18.745
That's medium-rare.

16:18.813 --> 16:20.614
<i>See the white fat?</i>
<i>Yeah, I do, Chef.</i>

16:20.682 --> 16:22.983
That's raw fat.
So when the fat's not melted,

16:23.051 --> 16:25.118
<i>that tells me straight away</i>
<i>that it's not cooked properly.</i>

16:25.186 --> 16:27.487
<i>One point</i>
<i>for the ladies.</i>

16:27.555 --> 16:28.855
Thank God!

16:28.923 --> 16:30.457
Even if the rest
of these people suck,

16:30.525 --> 16:32.426
at least he said
my food was delicious.

16:32.493 --> 16:34.528
Next two, let's go.

16:34.596 --> 16:36.663
(Announcer)
With the men and women tied
at two points each,

16:36.731 --> 16:38.198
executive Chef Gail...

16:38.266 --> 16:39.967
What a shame
you burned the potatoes.

16:40.034 --> 16:42.469

25:31.822 --> 25:33.723
as you're talking
to them?

25:33.790 --> 25:35.191
Um...That's very--

25:35.258 --> 25:37.226
thank you, Chef Ramsay,
for that advice.

25:37.294 --> 25:39.061
Well, raj,

25:39.129 --> 25:40.930
this is gonna be
a long night.

25:40.997 --> 25:43.265
Gentlemen, here we go.
4 covers, table 23.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.400
Two cheddar, one salad,
one Risotto.

25:44.468 --> 25:45.668
Yes, Chef.

25:45.736 --> 25:47.169
<i>All right, Boris.</i>
Yes, sir.

25:47.237 --> 25:47.803
Two pieces away.
Table three. Let's go.

25:47.871 --> 25:49.638
Two away, Chef.

25:49.706 --> 25:51.874
(Announcer)
Both Boris and Melissa
on the pizza station...

25:51.942 --> 25:53.743
We're up. Tomato and beef, Chef.
Margarita up.

25:53.810 --> 25:55.544
(Announcer)
Get their teams off
to a good start.

25:55.612 --> 25:56.512
(Gordon)
Let's go, service.

25:56.580 --> 25:58.147
Thank you.

25:58.215 --> 26:00.483
(Announcer)
And Jillian and nona
move forward

26:00.550 --> 26:02.318
with their appetizers.
One salad, one spaghetti.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.353
<i>Here you go, Chef.</i>
<i>Hot.</i>

26:04.421 --> 26:06.088
Ous as hell
because my boyfriend told me,

26:06.156 --> 26:07.757
"make sure you don't cook
your pasta too long,

26:07.824 --> 26:09.125
"because you like
your pasta soft,

26:09.192 --> 26:10.259
and Chef Ramsay doesn't."

26:10.327 --> 26:12.194
Let me taste it.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.234
Who cooked the spaghetti?

26:18.301 --> 26:20.703
I did.

26:20.771 --> 26:22.471
Yeah, very nice.
Thank you, Chef.

26:22.539 --> 26:25.174
Yeah.

26:25.242 --> 26:26.909
Keep up the good work,
Jillian.

26:26.977 --> 26:28.878
(Woman)
Good job, Jillian.
Thank you.

26:28.945 --> 26:31.580
Jillian's first pasta
has impressed Chef Ramsay.

26:31.648 --> 26:33.416
And in the blue kitchen...
Salad.

26:33.483 --> 26:36.385
Trev is hoping his first salad
will do the same.

26:36.453 --> 26:38.521
I have to prove to Chef Ramsay
that I can do this,

26:38.588 --> 26:40.356
and that's what I want
to do tonight

26:40.424 --> 26:41.924
is try and put out
the most perfect food

26:41.992 --> 26:44.360
that I possibly can.

26:44.428 --> 26:45.861
All of you!

26:45.929 --> 26:48.364
All of you, get here!

26:48.432 --> 26:52.868
<i>Who dressed that?</i>

26:55.372 --> 26:56.405
Too much.

26:56.473 --> 26:57.840
Too much?

26:57.908 --> 26:59.341
<i>Do you honestly think</i>

26:59.409 --> 27:00.776
they came here for that?

27:00.844 --> 27:01.844
<i>No.</i>

27:01.912 --> 27:03.312
<i>We've got worse now.</i>

27:03.380 --> 27:06.248
We gotta undress
the [Bleep] Salad.

27:06.316 --> 27:07.917
<i>Salad, trev, let's go!</i>

27:07.984 --> 27:09.185
(Trev)
Who doesn't know how
to make salad?

27:09.252 --> 27:10.920
This guy.

27:10.987 --> 27:15.090
Thanks to trev, no appetizers
have left the blue kitchen.

27:15.158 --> 27:17.092
If you could hurry it along,
it would be very great.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.794
Our apologies.

27:18.862 --> 27:20.629
(Announcer)
The red team, however,

27:20.697 --> 27:22.331
has served half of their
customers' appetizers.

27:22.399 --> 27:25.301
But some of them have not
received their welcoming pizza.

27:25.368 --> 27:27.303
Melissa.
Yes, Chef.

27:27.370 --> 27:29.905
Touch that.That.

27:29.973 --> 27:32.141
What is that?
It's raw, Chef.

27:32.209 --> 27:33.509
It's what?
<i>Raw, Chef.</i>

27:33.577 --> 27:35.211
Touch that!

27:35.278 --> 27:37.246
It's raw, Melissa!

27:37.314 --> 27:39.081
Yes, Chef.

27:39.149 --> 27:41.917
It's raw. Come on!
Yes, Chef.

27:41.985 --> 27:43.486
[Boris, imitating gordon]
It's raw!

27:45.889 --> 27:49.658
It's [Bleep] Raw!

27:49.726 --> 27:51.160
Boris, what were you
thinkin', Buddy?

27:51.228 --> 27:53.395
You don't mock
Gordon Ramsay.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.697
Boris.
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

27:54.764 --> 27:56.031
Come here.
Yes, sir.

27:56.032 --> 27:58.100
So I'm telling her
about a

27:58.168 --> 28:00.836
and you're mimicking me
at the back.
Sorry, Chef.

28:00.904 --> 28:03.205
Yeah. What's your game?
I'm just here
to cook, sir.

28:03.273 --> 28:04.807
So I'm telling her
the pizza's raw--

28:04.875 --> 28:05.708
come here,
you [Bleep]Face.

28:05.775 --> 28:07.443
Oh, no!

28:07.444 --> 28:09.778
And there you go.
You touc

28:09.846 --> 28:11.347
now, look at me!

28:11.414 --> 28:13.949
Take the the piss outta me
now, [Bleep]Face!

28:14.017 --> 28:16.085
I'm ready for you
to [Bleep] Around!

28:16.152 --> 28:17.219
I understand--
I'm ready for you
to [Bleep] Around!

28:24.642 --> 28:26.142
(Announcer)
It's an hour
into an opening night

28:26.210 --> 28:27.544
filled with careless mistakes.

28:27.612 --> 28:30.680
Touch that!
It's raw! Come on!

28:30.748 --> 28:33.049
(Announcer)
But one Chef...
It's raw!

28:33.117 --> 28:34.684
Has made a mistake
that Chef Ramsay

28:34.752 --> 28:36.920
is not going to forgive
or forget.

28:36.988 --> 28:38.555
Boris. Come here.
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

28:38.623 --> 28:40.590
So I'm telling her
about a raw pizza,

28:40.658 --> 28:42.259
and you're mimicking me
at the back.

28:42.326 --> 28:43.493
Sorry, Chef.

28:43.561 --> 28:44.828
What's your [Bleep]
Crack?

28:44.895 --> 28:46.329
I don't have
any crack, Chef.

28:46.397 --> 28:47.631
What's your game?
I'm just here
to cook, sir.

28:47.698 --> 28:49.165
Now, look at me!

28:49.233 --> 28:50.767
You [Bleep] Take the piss
out of me one more time

28:50.835 --> 28:52.369
is the middle of [Bleep]
Service, yeah,

28:52.436 --> 28:53.870
kiss your [Bleep] Ass
good-bye.

28:53.938 --> 28:55.338
Is that clear?
Understood, Chef.

28:55.406 --> 28:57.774
Wake up!
Will not happen again.

28:57.842 --> 29:00.043
Shouldn't have done that,
and I meant no disrespect.

29:00.111 --> 29:02.012
What can I say?
I'm losing my mind.

29:02.079 --> 29:03.680
All right, just concentrate.
Look at me, look at me.

29:03.748 --> 29:05.148
Just [Bleep] Concentrate.

29:05.216 --> 29:08.151
Will do, Chef.
Yes, sir.

29:08.219 --> 29:10.587
Come on, we're starting
to fall way behind on these.

29:10.655 --> 29:12.689
(Announcer)
While Boris tries
to catch up on pizzas,

29:12.757 --> 29:15.525
the red team continues
to push out appetizers.

29:15.593 --> 29:17.093
Scallops.

29:17.161 --> 29:19.062
Lisa, we have more
scallops going?

29:19.130 --> 29:20.897
Yeah. They're goin'
down right now.

29:20.965 --> 29:22.198
Is your pan hot
that you just threw them in?

29:22.266 --> 29:24.501
I didn't throw 'em in yet.

29:24.568 --> 29:26.436
Lisa's slow.
She's so slow.

29:26.504 --> 29:28.138
She moves like a turtle.

29:28.205 --> 29:29.673
They're not in the pan
right now?

29:29.740 --> 29:31.408
What?

29:33.644 --> 29:34.978
Oh, it's right here.

29:35.046 --> 29:37.580
Oh, bangida, bangida,
bangida.

29:37.648 --> 29:39.249
<i>Have you realized, Lisa,</i>

29:39.317 --> 29:40.950
why there's no color
on your scallops yet?

29:42.386 --> 29:43.853
'Cause I keep turning them.

29:43.921 --> 29:45.755
And the [Bleep] Pan's
not hot enough.

29:45.823 --> 29:47.791
Okay, Chef.

29:47.858 --> 29:50.026
(Sabrina)
Can I go with my Wellington?

29:50.094 --> 29:51.728
No! They're boiled scallops.

29:51.796 --> 29:54.864
There's no color.
They're not even hot.

29:54.932 --> 29:56.800
Lisa's been cooking
for 30 years.

29:56.867 --> 29:58.601
How long does it take
to learn how to cook scallops?

29:58.669 --> 30:00.437
I guess longer than 30 years.

30:00.504 --> 30:03.073
Oh...This is not good.

30:03.140 --> 30:04.974
While Lisa's work
on the fish station

30:05.042 --> 30:07.744
has left her teammates
seriously underwhelmed,

30:07.812 --> 30:09.979
over in the blue kitchen...

30:10.047 --> 30:11.614
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Trent!</i>
Chef?

30:11.682 --> 30:13.750
Trev's salad is once again
seriously overdressed.

30:13.818 --> 30:14.751
Oh, my God!

30:14.819 --> 30:16.319
Probably too much, Chef.

30:16.387 --> 30:18.822
That's just on
one [Bleep] Leaf. Come on!

30:18.889 --> 30:21.358
Yes, Chef.
Dress me a [Bleep] Salad!

30:24.095 --> 30:25.328
<i>Hey.</i>

30:25.396 --> 30:27.397
[Bleep] You all.

30:27.465 --> 30:29.899
I almost wrapped my hands
around his narrow neck.

30:29.967 --> 30:32.669
Salad. Salad!
Get the salad out!

30:32.737 --> 30:34.204
Nothing's easier.

30:34.271 --> 30:35.872
Here's that salad
you're waiting on.

30:35.940 --> 30:37.407
Thank you!
<i>You're very welcome.</i>

30:37.475 --> 30:39.542
Service, please.

30:39.610 --> 30:41.311
<i>Blue team!</i>
(All)
Yes, Chef!

30:41.379 --> 30:43.913
<i>1 hour and 30 minutes</i>
<i>into service,</i>

30:43.981 --> 30:46.282
that's the first table
of appetizers gone!

30:46.350 --> 30:47.417
Yes, Chef.
Yes, Chef.

30:47.485 --> 30:49.853
Oh, [Bleep] Hell.

30:49.920 --> 30:53.089
The men have finally sent out
their first appetizers.

30:53.157 --> 30:54.657
<i>(Woman)</i>
<i>I like it.</i>
<i>It's good.</i>

30:54.725 --> 30:56.426
But in the red kchen,

30:56.494 --> 30:58.895
Sabrina is ready with her
team's first entrees.

30:58.963 --> 31:00.530
Okay, I'm coming up.

31:00.598 --> 31:03.199
Unfortunately,
there's a slight problem.

31:03.267 --> 31:05.034
<i>(Gail)</i>
<i>Sabrina, hold up on that.</i>

31:05.102 --> 31:07.170
We need the salmon
and the tagliatelle first

31:07.238 --> 31:08.838
<i>before anything else.</i>
Dude, I can't wait!

31:08.906 --> 31:10.106
<i>Come on, man!</i>
Sabrina, don't get mad at me.

31:10.174 --> 31:11.775
We'rrder
of the tickets.
What?

31:11.842 --> 31:13.410
I just spent
like 20 minutes

31:13.477 --> 31:16.179
cooking all this,
letting it rest,

31:16.247 --> 31:18.481
doing it right, you know,
and it's like, honestly,

31:18.549 --> 31:19.916
I wanna show him that.

31:19.984 --> 31:21.584
Here's the two beef
and the lamb.

31:21.652 --> 31:24.053
(Nona)
What is she doing?

31:24.121 --> 31:25.388
Two beef and lamb.
Where's the halibut?

31:25.456 --> 31:26.623
<i>Well, I just wanted</i>

31:26.690 --> 31:27.991
to bring this to you, Chef.

31:28.058 --> 31:29.259
You just what?

31:29.326 --> 31:31.394
I wanted to bring this
to you, Chef.

31:31.462 --> 31:32.429
<i>What?</i>

31:32.496 --> 31:34.063
Wha--uh--

31:34.131 --> 31:35.732
is this bitch crazy?

31:35.800 --> 31:37.467
And where's
the halibut then?

31:37.535 --> 31:39.202
<i>And where's the garnish?</i>

31:39.270 --> 31:41.004
Are you ready?
No, Chef.

31:41.071 --> 31:43.173
(Gail)
I told her not to bring
the beef up

31:43.240 --> 31:45.141
because everything has to come
up at the pass together so that

31:45.209 --> 31:47.544
we can send out the whole
entire table at the same time.

31:47.611 --> 31:49.846
Why are you throwing
them under the bus?
F.

31:49.914 --> 31:51.714
So what the [Bleep]
Is this doing here?

31:51.782 --> 31:54.150
I'm sorry, Chef.
I cooked it for you, Chef.

31:54.218 --> 31:56.686
What can I do with it?
<i>Nothing, Chef.</i>

31:56.754 --> 31:59.456
<i>Oh, [Bleep] Off.</i>

31:59.523 --> 32:00.790
<i>Hey, baby Spice.</i>

32:00.858 --> 32:02.725
As long as
you're okay, right?

32:02.793 --> 32:05.261
No, Chef.
Here's my food.
[bleep] Everybody else.

32:05.329 --> 32:09.866
She doesn't [Bleep] Care.

32:09.934 --> 32:12.602
(Announcer)
While Sabrina needs to get
back in sync with her team,

32:12.670 --> 32:15.238
in the blue kitchen,
Chef Ramsay needs...

32:15.306 --> 32:16.339
<i>Raj!</i>

32:16.407 --> 32:18.641
Help them or [Bleep] Off.

32:20.277 --> 32:22.045
It was fairly abusive
on his part.

32:22.112 --> 32:24.914
I'm a little bit worried
about Chef Ramsay's...

32:24.982 --> 32:25.982
You know, karma.

32:26.050 --> 32:28.117
Russell.
Yes, sir.

32:28.185 --> 32:30.520
<i>Kick off of there and let</i>
<i>these two work as a team.</i>

32:30.588 --> 32:32.222
(Russell)
Boris and raj
are working together.

32:32.289 --> 32:35.024
It's like watching
two idiots do a rubik's cube.

32:35.092 --> 32:37.026
There's no chance on earth
they're gonna get it right.

32:37.094 --> 32:38.328
The mozzarella cheese.
I got the cheese.

32:38.395 --> 32:40.597
All I'm asking you
is to please help me

32:40.664 --> 32:41.865
roll the [Bleep] Dough.
<i>(Raj)</i>
<i>Where the [Bleep] Is it?</i>

32:41.932 --> 32:43.166
<i>Oh, it's here.</i>

32:43.234 --> 32:45.401
First shape it.
Here. Put it here.

32:45.469 --> 32:46.769
<i>Put it down.</i>
<i>Shape it.</i>

32:46.837 --> 32:48.204
The dough--
you can't roll it.

32:48.272 --> 32:49.873
<i>Roll the [Bleep]</i>

32:49.940 --> 32:50.874
Pizza dough.

32:50.941 --> 32:52.609
<i>Here's more mozzarella.</i>

32:52.676 --> 32:54.410
Roll the [Bleep] Pizza dough!
What are you doing?

32:54.478 --> 32:56.012
Are you [Bleep]?

32:56.080 --> 32:58.081
[Groans]

32:58.148 --> 33:00.583
My partner was sent here
to sabotage.

33:00.651 --> 33:02.919
That guy is [Bleep] Nuts.

33:02.987 --> 33:04.954
Why aren't you two
working as a team?

33:05.022 --> 33:06.356
<i>(Raj)</i>
<i>We're doing the best</i>
<i>we can, Chef.</i>

33:06.423 --> 33:09.926
We're screwed
on a [Bleep] Pizza.

33:09.994 --> 33:12.428
(Announcer)
Raj and Boris's inability
to make pizza

33:12.496 --> 33:14.464
has slowed down the blue team,

33:14.532 --> 33:16.566
but over in the red kitchen...
Halibut.

33:16.634 --> 33:19.669
Lisa has picked up the pace
and is ready with her halibut.

33:19.737 --> 33:21.938
(Gordon)
Halibut down here, please.

33:22.006 --> 33:23.473
Lisa!

33:23.541 --> 33:24.507
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>
Come here.

33:27.811 --> 33:30.013
It's Sushi.
I'm sorry, Chef.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.748
Hey, madame.
What's happening here?

33:31.815 --> 33:33.249
(Lisa)
It was a mess.

33:33.317 --> 33:35.151
I [Bleep] Up big time.

33:35.219 --> 33:37.754
And I'm really
disappointed in myself.

33:37.821 --> 33:40.189
(Announcer)
Over two hours
into dinner service...

33:40.257 --> 33:42.091
(Gordon)
Ay yi yi yi yi.

33:42.159 --> 33:44.861
And, unbelievably, no entrees
have left either kitchen.

33:46.497 --> 33:47.830
Nothing's coming
out of that kitchen.

33:47.898 --> 33:49.499
Yeah. I'm really
surprised.

33:49.567 --> 33:50.900
And not surprisingly,

33:50.968 --> 33:53.770
the diners
are completely Fed up.

33:53.837 --> 33:55.972
Chef, I've got tables
walking out.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.674
<i>They've been here</i>
<i>for two hours, Chef.</i>

33:57.741 --> 33:58.741
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>[bleep] Hell!</i>

34:29.949 --> 34:31.750
(Announcer)
Over two hours
into dinner service,

34:31.760 --> 34:33.179
not a single entree

34:33.295 --> 34:35.063
has left either kitchen,

34:35.130 --> 34:36.898
and the diners are leaving.

34:36.966 --> 34:38.500
No one's even
working together.

34:38.567 --> 34:40.368
No one's even caring!

34:40.436 --> 34:42.971
[Bleep] Off. Is that clear?
(All)
Yes, Chef.

34:43.038 --> 34:44.239
<i>Everything off.</i>
<i>Clear down.</i>

34:44.306 --> 34:46.808
I've never in my life had

34:46.876 --> 34:48.342
such a disastrous service...
Ever.

34:48.411 --> 34:49.277
[Sighs]

34:51.480 --> 34:53.815
That, honestly,

34:53.882 --> 34:58.553
has to be the worst ever
opening in Hell's Kitchen.

34:58.621 --> 35:01.022
<i>Tonight we set a new low.</i>

35:01.090 --> 35:05.393
<i>Congratulations.</i>

35:05.461 --> 35:07.495
There's no winning team.

35:07.563 --> 35:10.732
Both teams n
upstairs and nominate

35:10.800 --> 35:12.634
heies.

35:12.701 --> 35:14.636
<i>But the good news is</i>

35:14.703 --> 35:17.138
you're spoiled for choice.

35:17.206 --> 35:18.239
[Bleep] Off.

35:22.812 --> 35:25.213
We lost our battle today.
We all sucked.

35:25.281 --> 35:28.249
So we all are now
looking for the blame.

35:28.317 --> 35:29.784
Easiest way to do this

35:29.852 --> 35:31.252
is to write votes down
and count 'em out.

35:31.320 --> 35:32.954
Any objections?
No objections.

35:33.022 --> 35:34.923
<i>I'm sorry, raj,</i>
<i>honestly speaking,</i>

35:34.990 --> 35:36.791
you did things today that were
totally out of character

35:36.859 --> 35:37.792
<i>for any Chef.</i>

35:37.860 --> 35:40.361
Raise your hand for raj.

35:40.429 --> 35:43.164
Everybody's just
completely jealous of me.

35:43.232 --> 35:45.166
And that's the only
reason why...

35:45.234 --> 35:47.469
They wanna eliminate me,
'cause they know I'm gonna win.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.137
<i>Trev, five salads, though.</i>

35:49.205 --> 35:51.072
I'm sorry, man, you know.
Five salads.

35:51.140 --> 35:53.141
Raise your hand for Trevor.

35:55.211 --> 35:57.712
All right, it's Trevor.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.881
It all came down
to the crazy guy and myself.

35:59.949 --> 36:03.017
Damn right I'm scared
about goin' home.

36:03.085 --> 36:05.620
I would nominate you
based on the fish--

36:05.688 --> 36:07.755
the halibut.

36:07.823 --> 36:10.024
The halibut--whoo!
You saw me.
I'm like...[bleep]!

36:10.092 --> 36:11.526
I don't know if Lisa's
got what it takes.

36:11.594 --> 36:13.027
She's sweet or whatever,

36:13.095 --> 36:14.496
but she can't handle
the pressure

36:14.563 --> 36:15.530
that it takes
to work on the line.

36:15.598 --> 36:17.065
I'm way better than that.

36:17.132 --> 36:18.199
<i>I know I can cook</i>
<i>my ass off.</i>

36:19.835 --> 36:21.803
I can't defend
my performance tonight.

36:21.871 --> 36:24.005
But I really do know
what I'm doing.

36:24.073 --> 36:26.241
It didn't look like it tonight,
but I really do.

36:26.308 --> 36:28.076
Nona, who do you think
it should be?

36:28.143 --> 36:29.310
<i>I think it should</i>
<i>be you.</i>

36:29.378 --> 36:30.812
You think it should be me?

36:30.880 --> 36:33.481
Of course, 'cause I think
it should be your ass!

36:33.549 --> 36:35.517
<i>Your signature dish,</i>
<i>it didn't cut it.</i>

36:35.584 --> 36:37.018
<i>Now, maybe if you would</i>
<i>have cooked it right,</i>

36:37.086 --> 36:38.353
<i>but I mean, fine dining...</i>

36:38.420 --> 36:40.188
Fried chicken,
you can't cook an asparagus?

36:40.256 --> 36:43.691
Nona thinks that fine dining
is fried chicken?

36:43.759 --> 36:46.461
She has no clue.
She doesn't got a clue.

36:46.529 --> 36:48.096
Tell me why you think
I should go home.

36:48.163 --> 36:49.631
I just didn't think

36:49.698 --> 36:51.633
that you were a real
good team player.

36:51.700 --> 36:53.601
Why else should I go home?
Tell me.
I'm telling you.

36:53.669 --> 36:55.336
She went all gangster on me.

36:55.404 --> 36:56.738
You're all talk.
(Nona)
She's an idiot.

36:56.805 --> 36:58.740
She has a lot of potential,

36:58.807 --> 37:00.942
<i>and I think you're just</i>
<i>kind of looking at it wrong.</i>

37:01.010 --> 37:02.744
I'm not putting Sabrina
up there--that's my girl, man.

37:02.811 --> 37:04.746
I'm not like
trying to attack you.

37:04.813 --> 37:06.748
Nona, she's just--eeh.

37:06.815 --> 37:09.317
She gets under my skin.
Something about her.

37:09.385 --> 37:10.952
<i>(Sabrina)</i>
<i>Who's being nominated?</i>

37:11.020 --> 37:13.221
I don't know, man.
This is [Bleep] Hard.

37:23.732 --> 37:25.867
Raj, come on.

37:32.274 --> 37:34.409
I've got something
very important to tell you all.

37:34.476 --> 37:36.344
I just got word
from the hospital,

37:36.412 --> 37:38.680
and antonia will not be
returning to Hell's Kitchen.

37:38.747 --> 37:41.816
But one of you is still
going home tonight.

37:43.519 --> 37:46.020
Louis.
Yes, Chef.

37:46.088 --> 37:48.189
Who is the men's
first nominee, and why?

37:48.257 --> 37:52.727
Chef, the men's first nominee
tonight is raj.

37:52.795 --> 37:54.596
<i>He seemed a little delusional</i>
<i>about his performance.</i>

37:54.663 --> 37:56.064
Delusional...

37:56.131 --> 37:57.599
Spot on.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.167
<i>Second nominee and why.</i>

37:59.234 --> 38:01.369
Trevor.
<i>Trev.</i>

38:01.437 --> 38:02.870
<i>His holdup of the apps</i>

38:02.938 --> 38:05.540
really took our kitchen
down tonight.

38:05.608 --> 38:07.275
Gail.
Yes, Chef.

38:07.343 --> 38:09.644
<i>The women's first nominee</i>

38:09.712 --> 38:11.312
and why.

38:11.380 --> 38:13.381
Our first nominee tonight
is Lisa

38:13.449 --> 38:14.749
<i>based on her dinner service</i>
<i>on the fish station.</i>

38:14.817 --> 38:16.217
<i>It was terrible.</i>
Terrible.

38:16.285 --> 38:18.119
Second nominee and why.

38:21.790 --> 38:24.292
Our second nominee tonight
is...

38:31.676 --> 38:34.778
(Announcer)
The blue team has put
trev and raj up for elimination.

38:34.846 --> 38:37.447
The red team has chosen Lisa
as their first nominee

38:37.515 --> 38:39.916
and now must give
Chef Ramsay their second.

38:39.984 --> 38:43.453
Our second nominee tonight...

38:43.521 --> 38:45.856
Is Sabrina.

38:47.525 --> 38:48.792
Sabrina.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.360
<i>Based on her lack</i>
<i>of teamwork</i>

38:50.428 --> 38:52.095
during dinner service.
<i>Okay.</i>

38:52.163 --> 38:54.197
<i>Raj, trev,</i>
<i>lisa, Sabrina,</i>

38:54.265 --> 38:56.199
<i>step forward, please.</i>

38:57.768 --> 38:59.236
Dear, oh, dear.

38:59.303 --> 39:01.638
<i>I've never felt</i>
<i>so disappointed</i>

39:01.706 --> 39:03.106
on the opening
of Hell's Kitchen.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.374
<i>Trev.Ir.</i>

39:04.442 --> 39:05.575
Why should you stay?

39:05.643 --> 39:07.143
'Cause I think
I can do this.

39:07.211 --> 39:08.311
<i>I think I can be</i>
<i>a great Chef.</i>

39:08.379 --> 39:09.946
I'm self-taught.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.815
I might not have the experience
that these guys do,

39:11.883 --> 39:13.617
<i>but I got the drive</i>
<i>to do it.</i>

39:13.684 --> 39:15.752
Raj...Why should you
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:15.820 --> 39:17.654
Now that I'm more
familiar with everything,

39:17.722 --> 39:19.022
<i>i'll be able</i>
<i>to jump in there</i>

39:19.090 --> 39:20.624
and really cook
the food correctly--

39:20.691 --> 39:22.559
aren't you the most
experienced Chef in here?

39:22.627 --> 39:25.128
Yes.
You've been cooking
longer than <i>me.</i>

39:25.196 --> 39:26.129
Yes.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.797
[Bleep]!

39:29.934 --> 39:31.968
Lisa.
Yes, Chef.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.937
Why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

39:34.005 --> 39:35.672
I take full responsibility
for my service tonight.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.775
I was nervous.
My timing was completely off.

39:38.843 --> 39:41.044
<i>I know that I can do</i>
<i>much better than this.</i>

39:41.112 --> 39:43.280
I know I can.

39:43.347 --> 39:47.050
<i>Sabrina, you are,</i>
<i>quite frankly,</i>

39:47.118 --> 39:49.552
the most selfish cook
in here.

39:49.620 --> 39:51.321
<i>Believe it or not,</i>
<i>you don't know me,</i>

39:51.389 --> 39:54.157
and you don't know
what I'm capable of, Chef.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.326
I made a mistake.
I [Bleep] Up.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.061
Give me an opportunity
to prove to you

39:58.129 --> 39:59.496
that I can do better, Chef.

39:59.563 --> 40:00.664
<i>And honestly,</i>

40:00.731 --> 40:02.132
if it's between us two,

40:02.199 --> 40:04.868
I mean...I'm--

40:04.936 --> 40:06.403
she's spent, Chef,
you know?

40:06.470 --> 40:07.938
I'm young.
The world is my oyster.

40:08.005 --> 40:09.306
What was that?
I'm spent?

40:09.373 --> 40:10.573
<i>Spent?</i>
You're spent.

40:10.641 --> 40:11.808
Finished.
<i>Yeah, you're finished.</i>

40:11.876 --> 40:12.542
<i>(Lisa)</i>
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

40:12.610 --> 40:13.710
<i>No, I'm serious.</i>

40:13.778 --> 40:15.378
I will cook circles
around you, honey.

40:15.446 --> 40:16.680
<i>I may be 48,</i>
<i>but believe me,</i>

40:16.747 --> 40:18.348
you don't have a chance.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.583
<i>Sabrina, who do you</i>
<i>think should go home?</i>

40:20.651 --> 40:22.552
I think that nona
should go home, Chef.

40:22.620 --> 40:24.521
<i>Her idea of fine dining</i>

40:24.588 --> 40:27.023
is fried chicken, Chef?

40:27.091 --> 40:28.959
She can't cook asparagus.

40:29.026 --> 40:32.062
She snores,
and it keeps us all awake.

40:32.129 --> 40:36.299
And I honestly believe
she's good for nothing, Chef.

40:36.367 --> 40:38.702
[Whispering]
That was low.
[clears throat]

40:38.769 --> 40:40.570
<i>She's crap</i>
<i>and she can't cook asparagus,</i>

40:40.638 --> 40:41.838
but she's not standing
in your shoes there.

40:41.906 --> 40:43.473
<i>Quite frankly,</i>

40:43.541 --> 40:45.208
all four of you should go.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.043
My decision is...

40:47.111 --> 40:50.580
[Dramatic music]

40:50.648 --> 40:52.482
Sabrina.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.818
Please give me
another chance, Chef.

40:54.885 --> 40:56.653
Shut it.

40:56.721 --> 40:58.955
Back in line.
Thank you, Chef.

41:01.892 --> 41:03.460
You.
Yes, sir.

41:03.527 --> 41:06.363
Back in line.
Thank you, sir.

41:06.430 --> 41:08.398
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen...

41:08.466 --> 41:10.934
[Dramatic music]

41:11.002 --> 41:12.035
Lisa.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.237
<i>Give me your jacket.</i>

41:14.305 --> 41:16.039
Your short time
in Hell's Kitchen is over.

41:16.107 --> 41:17.273
Thank you for
the opportunity, Chef.

41:17.341 --> 41:18.675
A little over
your head, my darling.

41:18.743 --> 41:19.843
Good night.
Good night, Chef.

41:22.246 --> 41:23.213
<i>Back in line.</i>

41:24.849 --> 41:26.683
I honestly
never would have thought

41:26.751 --> 41:28.351
I would have been
the first person to go home.

41:28.419 --> 41:30.353
This competition
was everything to me.

41:30.421 --> 41:33.189
Chef Ramsay should have
sent Sabrina home.

41:33.257 --> 41:34.991
There's no doubt in my mind

41:35.059 --> 41:37.127
if I ever met her
in a cook-off, I'd kick her ass.

41:37.194 --> 41:39.462
We need to make
a massive comeback.

41:39.530 --> 41:41.598
<i>You all have a choice.</i>

41:41.665 --> 41:43.867
<i>Get serious</i>
<i>or get out.</i>

41:43.934 --> 41:46.302
Now [Bleep] Off.

41:46.370 --> 41:47.771
Raj is back!

41:47.838 --> 41:50.073
That's right, Ramsay.
And I'm ready to fight.

41:50.141 --> 41:51.741
Whoo!

41:51.809 --> 41:54.444
Sabrina tried
to throw me under the bus.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.280
Are you serious?
The claws are out now.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.082
I'm here
to win this damn thing.

41:59.150 --> 42:00.850
(Gordon)
The only thing positive

42:00.918 --> 42:02.252
I can say about
Lisa's performance tonight--

42:02.319 --> 42:04.454
she didn't kill anyone.

42:31.015 --> 42:32.782
to see what these cutthroat
Chefs do to get ahead.

42:32.850 --> 42:34.818
How dare you condescend
to me.

42:34.885 --> 42:37.220
Jackass!
[bleep] You, bitch!

42:37.288 --> 42:38.988
(Announcer)
It's every Chef for himself.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.824
Are you trying to sabotage
your own team?

42:40.891 --> 42:42.659
I would never do
anything of the sort.

42:42.726 --> 42:43.693
(Announcer)
And Chef Ramsay...
[bleep]!

42:43.761 --> 42:45.361
Is having none of it.

42:45.429 --> 42:47.564
You do not decide what
goes out this kitchen!

42:47.631 --> 42:48.598
I've had enough!

42:48.666 --> 42:50.233
Get out, you!

42:50.301 --> 42:51.701
Get out!
Get out!

42:51.769 --> 42:53.036
Get out!

42:53.104 --> 42:54.604
(Announcer)
Next time...

42:54.672 --> 42:56.706
What an evil thing
to do to somebody.

42:56.774 --> 42:58.441
(Announcer)
On the most devious
<i>Hell's Kitchen</i> ever...

42:58.509 --> 43:00.376
(Gordon)
All of you, [Bleep] Off home!
