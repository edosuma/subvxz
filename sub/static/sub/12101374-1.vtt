00:23.232 --> 00:24.667
<i>In the early 1700s,</i>

00:24.701 --> 00:27.302
<i>a sailor aboard a British
merchant ship wrote,</i>

00:27.336 --> 00:28.471
<i>"The beauty of the ocean</i>

00:28.505 --> 00:31.508
<i>is one of the world's
greatest treasures."</i>

00:31.541 --> 00:32.709
<i>Yet throughout history,</i>

00:32.742 --> 00:35.445
<i>the men who have sailed
her have overlooked it.</i>

00:35.478 --> 00:39.248
<i>Blinded by the desire for
old gold and glittering gems,</i>

00:39.281 --> 00:42.284
<i>they embarked on voyages
to the ends of the earth</i>

00:42.317 --> 00:45.488
<i>and even beyond
the boundaries of time.</i>

01:16.285 --> 01:19.254
She's carrying
treasure for sure.

01:19.288 --> 01:20.457
Fire!

01:36.205 --> 01:39.074
Captain, they're upon us.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.250
Come on, mateys,
on her! Get on her!

02:18.247 --> 02:20.315
Get in there,
get in there!

02:20.349 --> 02:21.784
Go!

02:21.818 --> 02:23.553
- Get on the ground.
- On your knees!

02:24.754 --> 02:26.321
Please, please, don't.

02:28.591 --> 02:32.395
Ah, Mr. Pistol, this one
here is going on and on

02:32.428 --> 02:35.197
about the lost treasure
of William Kidd.

02:35.230 --> 02:37.467
<i>Por favor,</i> Senor Pirate.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.101
We are just mere scientists.

02:39.836 --> 02:41.169
There's a map.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.070
There's a map.

02:42.104 --> 02:44.072
You can take...
you can have the map.

02:44.106 --> 02:45.475
You can...

02:45.508 --> 02:47.410
You can...

02:54.182 --> 02:56.285
Where is this map
your friend speaks of?

02:56.318 --> 02:58.053
He is crazy from the sun.

02:58.788 --> 03:00.557
We know of no treasure map.

03:01.858 --> 03:03.058
Really?

03:06.328 --> 03:08.464
Oh. That map.

03:29.619 --> 03:31.554
This is a map
to Kill Devil Cove...

03:33.590 --> 03:34.591
just south of here.

03:35.391 --> 03:36.826
Yes.

03:36.859 --> 03:40.162
But you'll never be able
to decipher it without our help.

03:40.897 --> 03:41.864
Hmm.

03:41.898 --> 03:45.735
Well then, let every
man on board be spared...

03:47.837 --> 03:50.406
lest our spoils be tainted
by unnecessary bloodshed.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.443
Here's to the <i>Devil's Wing</i>
and her merciful crew.

04:02.852 --> 04:05.655
Ah, so Mr. Pistol...

04:06.856 --> 04:10.593
Ah, you spared the crew, did ya?

04:10.627 --> 04:13.529
Yes, Captain,
thought we might need them.

04:13.563 --> 04:15.765
Oh, you thought?

04:15.798 --> 04:19.368
But that'd be a Captain's
decision, wouldn't you say?

04:20.436 --> 04:21.571
Aye, Captain.

04:21.604 --> 04:23.573
You see,
it's thoughts like that

04:23.606 --> 04:25.475
that sealed
the fate of your father.

04:25.508 --> 04:29.379
I would hate for something
like that to happen to you.

04:30.680 --> 04:33.616
All right, easy lad, easy.

04:33.650 --> 04:35.551
You know I had no choice.

04:35.585 --> 04:38.521
It was the code. Hmm.

04:40.857 --> 04:42.892
- Aye, Captain.
- Hmm.

04:46.228 --> 04:47.664
You're a good man, Pistol.

04:47.697 --> 04:50.633
When the devil
comes for my soul,

04:50.667 --> 04:54.604
I'll need you there
to talk him out of it.

04:57.607 --> 05:00.476
Yeah. Yeah.

05:01.343 --> 05:02.344
Yeah.

05:03.546 --> 05:08.283
So, what's all this
about a treasure map?

05:08.985 --> 05:10.887
- Right.
- Ah. Hmm.

05:12.855 --> 05:13.890
Here you are, Captain.

05:13.923 --> 05:14.924
Ah.

05:16.693 --> 05:18.326
Hmm?

05:18.360 --> 05:19.729
Enjoy.

05:19.762 --> 05:20.797
Hmm.

05:22.632 --> 05:23.766
Carry on.

06:17.019 --> 06:18.788
Mr. Pistol's left the helm.

06:18.821 --> 06:21.424
Shh.

06:21.457 --> 06:23.459
La la la la la la la.

06:23.493 --> 06:25.327
Batten the hatches.

07:57.053 --> 07:58.855
Welcome aboard, Captain.

08:00.857 --> 08:02.491
Captain?

08:02.525 --> 08:03.893
She's your ship now.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.031
Make haste to man the sails.

08:12.068 --> 08:15.605
Tata, Captain Lynch.

08:23.613 --> 08:24.981
Huh? What?

08:31.120 --> 08:32.421
Stolen.

08:37.860 --> 08:40.162
You mutinous lot.

08:41.731 --> 08:42.832
Pistol.

08:49.005 --> 08:51.974
Mutiny on the bounty!

08:52.008 --> 08:54.210
I'm gonna get you, Pistol.

08:54.243 --> 08:56.178
How could you do this
to me, you betrayer?

09:00.516 --> 09:01.584
Fire!

09:05.154 --> 09:06.889
- Under attack!
- He's gonna kill me.

09:06.923 --> 09:08.057
Fire!

09:19.869 --> 09:21.203
Get the mainsail up!

09:21.237 --> 09:23.039
The mast buckle
is broken, Jeffrey.

09:23.072 --> 09:24.473
There's nothing we can do.

09:25.608 --> 09:26.642
Ay, ay, ay.

09:26.676 --> 09:28.611
We've got bigger
problems. Look.

09:32.248 --> 09:33.449
Blimey.

09:35.017 --> 09:36.018
All hands,

09:36.052 --> 09:39.555
brace yourselves,
we're going directly to hell.

10:02.011 --> 10:03.145
The map! Get the map!

10:03.179 --> 10:04.480
I got it!

10:14.924 --> 10:16.225
Pistol!

10:59.168 --> 11:00.202
That's it, Josh.

11:00.236 --> 11:02.838
Forward stretch, pull through.

11:02.872 --> 11:04.006
Feather.

11:05.274 --> 11:07.076
You're getting
great at this, bud.

11:42.011 --> 11:44.180
Hey guys, I think
I got something.

11:45.181 --> 11:47.283
Nice one, Hedge.

11:48.918 --> 11:50.086
- Hey, Josh.
- What's up, my man?

11:51.987 --> 11:54.190
Hey Brig. How's the blog?

11:54.223 --> 11:56.892
Shh, I'm on a deadline.

11:56.926 --> 11:59.028
Hey, you know what?
I'm keeping it.

11:59.061 --> 11:59.962
It could be worth something.

11:59.995 --> 12:02.164
My uncle Herm once
found a Coca-Cola sign

12:02.198 --> 12:03.365
that was worth 800 bucks.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.367
I saw your uncle on
<i>House Hoarders</i> last week.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.037
By the way,
the odds of discovering

12:08.070 --> 12:09.839
anything of value
with a metal detector

12:09.872 --> 12:12.041
on a public beach
are very slim.

12:12.074 --> 12:14.276
If you add up all the number
of hours searching necessary

12:14.310 --> 12:16.212
to find anything
worth at least $20,

12:16.245 --> 12:20.850
you get about 135.26 hours,

12:20.883 --> 12:22.284
so you're basically working

12:22.318 --> 12:24.320
for approximately
50 cents per hour.

12:24.353 --> 12:25.388
Yeah?

12:25.422 --> 12:28.891
Well, you haven't taken
into account the anomaly.

12:28.924 --> 12:29.992
The anomaly?

12:30.025 --> 12:32.094
Yeah, the anomaly.

12:32.128 --> 12:34.029
The unaccounted for,
unexplained event

12:34.063 --> 12:36.866
that occurs and defies
all logic and odds?

12:36.899 --> 12:38.834
It could happen,
but in your case,

12:38.868 --> 12:41.103
you'd better stick to your
job at the yogurt shop.

12:42.271 --> 12:43.873
You'll see.

12:43.906 --> 12:45.674
Hey, let him dream.

12:47.710 --> 12:49.379
I can't believe
someone is stealing

12:49.412 --> 12:51.914
all the cool pirate
artifacts from town.

12:51.947 --> 12:53.949
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.

12:53.983 --> 12:55.017
Who's with me?

13:13.436 --> 13:14.737
Whoa.

13:25.482 --> 13:28.418
Hey, guys? I think
I really got somethin'.

13:31.954 --> 13:33.490
Booyah!

13:33.523 --> 13:35.724
What you got
there, Huckleberry?

13:37.259 --> 13:38.894
Oh, nothing.

13:38.928 --> 13:40.296
Just a treasure map.

13:51.173 --> 13:54.109
Hedgey, baby,
I will never doubt you again.

13:54.143 --> 13:55.311
What do you think, Brig?

13:55.344 --> 13:57.813
It looks like
the real deal to me.

13:57.846 --> 14:01.050
Wait. This is a map
of Pirate's Cove.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.985
See, that's Devil's Bay and...

14:03.018 --> 14:05.422
and that's Adam's Light House,
and the Clock Tower.

14:06.288 --> 14:07.856
Oh, you just reminded me.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.427
- Summer school starts at 10:30.
- Boring.

14:10.460 --> 14:11.927
Can't we just ditch it?

14:11.961 --> 14:13.829
I mean,
it's the last day, anyway.

14:13.862 --> 14:16.065
My mom paid a hundred bucks
for that course,

14:16.098 --> 14:18.133
and I'm never gonna hear
the end of it if I don't go,

14:18.167 --> 14:19.835
so you guys have to come, too.

14:20.903 --> 14:21.904
Here.

14:24.273 --> 14:25.874
We'll stash it
in the tree house

14:25.908 --> 14:27.477
and we'll figure
this out after class.

14:27.510 --> 14:30.380
Wait. Maybe we should
tell my dad.

14:30.413 --> 14:32.047
I mean, what if
somebody lost it?

14:33.315 --> 14:35.418
I found it,
so it's rightfully mine.

14:35.452 --> 14:37.152
Dude, you're thinning us out?

14:37.186 --> 14:39.221
- I thought we were a team.
- Well...

14:39.255 --> 14:41.890
Okay. Fine.
It's all of ours,

14:41.924 --> 14:44.293
but I don't want to donate it
to some lame museum.

14:44.326 --> 14:46.463
Excuse me?

14:46.496 --> 14:48.030
I'm just saying.

14:50.266 --> 14:51.267
Let's go.

15:17.993 --> 15:19.295
Look at this.

15:19.328 --> 15:22.031
These are Lost Colony actors.

15:23.265 --> 15:24.900
For heaven's sakes.

15:24.933 --> 15:27.803
Blanche, have you ever
seen anything like this?

15:29.406 --> 15:32.341
No. This is a disgrace.

15:32.374 --> 15:35.210
Okay, folks.
Break it up, break it up.

15:36.312 --> 15:37.480
Look at this.

15:38.448 --> 15:40.115
- Oh, my head.
- Wakey, wakey.

15:41.484 --> 15:44.621
You guys are guilty
of section 115-50,

15:44.654 --> 15:47.524
which means you had a little
too much to drink last night.

15:47.557 --> 15:49.291
The ship.

15:49.325 --> 15:51.394
On the contrary, sir,
I barely had the sip last night.

15:52.495 --> 15:54.330
Oh, I don't think so.

15:54.363 --> 15:57.634
So why don't we all get up

15:57.667 --> 16:00.503
and take a little stroll
down to my station?

16:00.537 --> 16:01.571
Let's go.

16:01.604 --> 16:03.573
I got a nice place
for you to rest.

16:03.606 --> 16:04.973
Okay?

16:05.007 --> 16:08.043
Come on, come on.
You guys can walk it off.

16:08.077 --> 16:09.111
Come on, you two.

16:09.144 --> 16:10.212
Come on, you look worse...

16:10.245 --> 16:12.181
Oh. Oh, man.

16:13.416 --> 16:14.883
Let's go.

16:14.917 --> 16:16.653
Where are we?

16:16.686 --> 16:18.488
Where is the ship
and the others?

16:19.321 --> 16:20.356
All right?

16:20.390 --> 16:21.458
I do not know...

16:23.359 --> 16:25.127
but I dare say
it's best we play along.

16:26.061 --> 16:27.062
The less we say the better.

16:39.609 --> 16:42.445
Wow.
A real treasure map.

16:43.112 --> 16:44.146
Put that away.

16:44.179 --> 16:45.981
You want Byron to see it?

16:46.014 --> 16:47.082
No.

16:54.557 --> 16:56.426
Aw, crap, there he is.

16:56.459 --> 16:57.993
Stop right there.

17:00.563 --> 17:02.331
Hi, Byron.

17:02.364 --> 17:04.401
Uh, skipping summer school?

17:04.434 --> 17:05.635
Taking a homeschool course

17:05.668 --> 17:08.003
called Advanced Leisure Studies.

17:08.036 --> 17:09.271
What do you think you're doing?

17:09.304 --> 17:11.373
Um, walking?

17:11.408 --> 17:13.410
Well, you're ruining my view.

17:13.443 --> 17:15.344
My picture postcard
view of my world

17:15.378 --> 17:16.713
without a bunch
of losers in it.

17:16.746 --> 17:17.980
Yeah?

17:18.013 --> 17:19.214
Well how will your view look

17:19.248 --> 17:20.383
when I stuff your
head in that pitcher?

17:20.417 --> 17:21.484
Easy.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.720
- Whoa, was that a threat?
- Brig.

17:23.753 --> 17:25.655
Hey, Byron.

17:25.688 --> 17:27.990
Hello, Brigitte.
What's up?

17:28.023 --> 17:31.561
Oh, nothing, just taking some
donations to the orphanage.

17:31.594 --> 17:33.328
Interesting.

17:33.362 --> 17:34.363
Not.

17:34.397 --> 17:36.499
Hey Brig, when are you
going to lose these fools

17:36.533 --> 17:38.668
and come over to the
right side of the tracks?

17:38.701 --> 17:40.068
Just because your
dad is the mayor

17:40.102 --> 17:41.270
doesn't make you royalty.

17:41.303 --> 17:42.171
And what makes you think

17:42.204 --> 17:44.106
I would ever want
to hang out with you?

17:44.139 --> 17:46.208
Well, the answer
to that question

17:46.241 --> 17:48.478
is what's known as
the universal answer,

17:48.511 --> 17:51.146
the answer that
cuts through, clarifies,

17:51.180 --> 17:52.515
and captures the
essence of desires

17:52.549 --> 17:54.082
of people around the world.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.418
And what's that?

17:55.452 --> 17:56.519
Money.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.253
Money isn't everything.

17:58.287 --> 17:59.422
You're right.

18:00.322 --> 18:02.057
It's the only thing.

18:11.634 --> 18:13.335
They're up to something.

18:34.356 --> 18:36.759
Jenny Goldstein just
posted that my dad

18:36.793 --> 18:39.395
arrested a pack of drunken
pirates at the inlet beach.

18:39.429 --> 18:40.497
Look.

18:40.530 --> 18:41.764
Probably just actors from

18:41.798 --> 18:44.299
the Lost Colony
reenactment play.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.068
This map makes no sense.

18:46.101 --> 18:47.135
Where's the "X"?

18:47.169 --> 18:49.204
Made sense to someone.

18:49.238 --> 18:52.475
It's like a puzzle but we
don't know where to start.

18:52.509 --> 18:54.377
I wish my dad
was still around.

18:55.411 --> 18:57.480
He would know how
to figure this out.

18:57.514 --> 18:58.581
He was good at this stuff.

18:59.582 --> 19:00.817
Look for the alpha.

19:00.850 --> 19:02.284
There's always an alpha.

19:02.752 --> 19:03.953
A what?

19:03.987 --> 19:07.390
An alpha, the starting clue
to get you on the right track.

19:07.423 --> 19:10.593
It's like from the game
Castle of Ghouls.

19:10.627 --> 19:12.261
You have to examine
the paint strokes

19:12.294 --> 19:14.096
to find the secret passageway.

19:14.129 --> 19:15.297
That's a big help.

19:17.634 --> 19:20.503
Everyone put your right hand
on the skull of truth.

19:22.505 --> 19:24.206
Repeat after me:

19:24.239 --> 19:28.310
I swear not to tell
anyone about the map.

19:28.343 --> 19:31.213
I swear not to
tell anyone about the map.

19:31.246 --> 19:33.181
And whatever happens,
we will all get

19:33.215 --> 19:36.151
an equal share of the treasure
or whatever we find.

19:36.184 --> 19:38.353
And whatever happens,
we all get

19:38.388 --> 19:41.156
an equal share of the treasure
or whatever we find.

19:41.189 --> 19:42.825
It is done.

19:42.859 --> 19:44.661
- Okay.
- Sounds good to me.

19:44.694 --> 19:45.828
Wait.

19:45.862 --> 19:48.565
What if one of us dies before
we split up the treasure?

19:48.598 --> 19:50.500
- What?
- Really?

19:50.533 --> 19:52.869
I can't help it.
My dad's a lawyer.

19:52.902 --> 19:56.573
Your dad owns a yogurt shop
and does bail bonds.

19:56.606 --> 19:57.607
Same thing.

19:58.875 --> 20:00.075
Let's go.

20:01.611 --> 20:02.612
Hedge.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.213
What?

20:05.247 --> 20:06.382
On your face.

20:06.416 --> 20:07.650
What?

20:07.684 --> 20:09.084
Twinkie.

20:11.888 --> 20:13.423
Let's leave it in here.

20:32.575 --> 20:35.545
Hey, can you guys get
a little closer to each other?

20:37.747 --> 20:38.815
All right, good, perfect.

20:38.848 --> 20:40.717
Right there. Let's just do it.

20:40.750 --> 20:44.554
In 1587, 115 men,
women, and children

20:44.587 --> 20:46.288
set sail from
Plymouth, England

20:46.321 --> 20:48.691
to begin a new life
in a strange land.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.393
They vanished with
hardly a trace...

20:51.661 --> 20:54.764
Leaving the historians a mystery
that has never been solved.

20:54.797 --> 20:57.467
Many people believe...

20:57.500 --> 21:00.603
...that they disappeared into
the infamous Bermuda Triangle.

21:00.637 --> 21:02.605
The Lost Colony,
this is their story.

21:03.740 --> 21:06.609
Please, can someone
answer the phone?

21:06.643 --> 21:07.710
All right, hold on.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.379
Hold on a second, you guys.

21:11.714 --> 21:13.583
Uh, Betsy?

21:14.751 --> 21:16.653
Betsy, dear?

21:16.686 --> 21:17.720
Hi, hon.

21:17.754 --> 21:18.821
Could you please
answer the phone

21:18.855 --> 21:20.255
because otherwise
we're never going

21:20.288 --> 21:21.323
to get through all of this.

21:21.356 --> 21:23.693
No problem.

21:23.726 --> 21:27.195
Aunt Victoria? Can you call me
by my stage name, Constance?

21:28.431 --> 21:30.365
Of course, Betsy.

21:30.400 --> 21:33.770
I'm sorry, I mean,
Constance.

21:35.471 --> 21:37.440
Constance. The phone.

21:37.473 --> 21:38.541
Right.

21:45.882 --> 21:46.883
Hello.

21:47.784 --> 21:48.885
Hi, Earl.

21:49.919 --> 21:50.920
Constance.

21:53.456 --> 21:54.824
Earl, it's Betsy.

21:56.459 --> 21:57.460
Really?

21:58.661 --> 22:00.863
Well, I guess they
could be ours.

22:00.897 --> 22:02.532
Okay. I'll be right over.

22:05.034 --> 22:08.504
Okay, uh, let's take
it from the top again,

22:08.538 --> 22:10.372
and whatever happens,

22:10.406 --> 22:12.642
I just want you guys
to keep on going.

22:13.341 --> 22:14.444
Problem.

22:14.477 --> 22:15.712
Oh, what now?

22:15.745 --> 22:17.580
Seems a few of our actors got

22:17.613 --> 22:19.849
into a little trouble last night
and got thrown in jail.

22:20.683 --> 22:22.719
Our actors?

22:22.752 --> 22:25.788
Oh, the Renaissance
Faire guys from Raleigh.

22:25.822 --> 22:28.458
Oh, well at least they
showed up this year.

22:28.491 --> 22:30.593
Earl says it's no big deal
and I can go pick them up.

22:30.626 --> 22:31.761
Okay.

22:31.794 --> 22:33.596
Guess it pays to have a relative
who's the town sheriff.

22:33.629 --> 22:34.697
Yes it does.

22:34.731 --> 22:36.699
Okay, you go do that while...

22:37.800 --> 22:39.435
Don't worry. I can fix them.

22:39.469 --> 22:41.369
- Fix what?
- Those nails.

22:41.404 --> 22:43.473
Stop with my nails.

22:43.506 --> 22:44.774
- Go.
- I'll be right back.

22:44.807 --> 22:46.476
All right, fine.
Oh wait, Betsy.

22:46.509 --> 22:48.511
Hey, while you're out,
can you stop by the house

22:48.544 --> 22:50.646
and see if Josh has
any pirate props?

22:50.680 --> 22:51.714
Okie dokie.

22:51.748 --> 22:53.015
Okie dokie, thank you.

22:54.917 --> 22:59.822
Therefore according
to Mr. Einstein's theory

22:59.856 --> 23:04.627
regarding the intersection
between time and space,

23:04.660 --> 23:06.896
one would presume
to be able to travel

23:06.929 --> 23:08.598
to any place in history.

23:08.631 --> 23:11.501
There's one key missing
factor, isn't there?

23:13.368 --> 23:14.369
Joshua?

23:16.105 --> 23:17.339
Hmm?

23:17.372 --> 23:18.441
Come on.

23:19.609 --> 23:20.743
You know this.

23:21.978 --> 23:23.646
Anything, Joshua?

23:24.647 --> 23:25.748
Hmm?

23:25.782 --> 23:27.083
Oh.

23:27.116 --> 23:28.684
Mr. Young.

23:28.718 --> 23:30.553
Wouldn't the result
of such a journey

23:30.586 --> 23:32.755
be completely random
unless one cannot only

23:32.789 --> 23:34.657
plot the eventual destination

23:34.690 --> 23:36.025
on the time-space continuum

23:36.058 --> 23:39.896
but also guide the subject
to that destination?

23:39.929 --> 23:43.065
And what's the solution
to that? Hm?

23:43.099 --> 23:46.769
What's the solution to
controlling this intersection?

23:48.104 --> 23:49.705
Come on, children.

23:49.739 --> 23:51.373
Use your beans.

23:51.407 --> 23:52.441
That's easy.

23:52.475 --> 23:53.643
You need a time machine.

23:54.977 --> 23:56.479
Precisely.

23:59.782 --> 24:01.484
I'll be giving extra
credit to anybody

24:01.517 --> 24:03.820
who comes up with a design
for a time machine

24:03.853 --> 24:06.889
and schematics based on
the principles of this class.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.118
Josh?

24:37.887 --> 24:39.021
Anyone home?

24:42.158 --> 24:43.426
It's Constance.

25:04.947 --> 25:06.482
That's perfect.

25:07.750 --> 25:09.719
I'll take this,

25:09.752 --> 25:10.953
and this,

25:11.454 --> 25:12.488
and this.

25:32.975 --> 25:35.511
Don't mind if I dino do.

25:41.984 --> 25:43.152
Mayor Beecher.

25:45.187 --> 25:47.790
Listen, you nitwit, I don't
care what you do with it,

25:47.823 --> 25:48.758
just move it.

25:48.791 --> 25:51.727
I want that stuff out
of this town pronto.

25:51.761 --> 25:53.863
People are starting
to ask questions.

25:54.697 --> 25:56.832
Out of sight, out of mind.

26:01.170 --> 26:02.438
Problems?

26:02.939 --> 26:03.940
No problems.

26:05.942 --> 26:09.912
Byron, my son,
we are Beecher men.

26:09.946 --> 26:11.213
We don't have problems,

26:11.247 --> 26:14.984
we have new opportunities
to find solutions

26:15.017 --> 26:17.920
and to achieve greater success.

26:17.954 --> 26:19.722
<i>Mr. Mayor,
remember you have to</i>

26:19.755 --> 26:21.824
<i>do that speech
at the bake sale today.</i>

26:21.857 --> 26:23.526
Ah, diddly poop!

26:33.970 --> 26:35.905
Hi, Earl.

26:35.938 --> 26:38.140
Any update on
the stolen artifacts?

26:38.174 --> 26:39.675
No, nothing yet, Betsy.

26:39.709 --> 26:40.977
Constance.

26:41.010 --> 26:42.678
- What's that?
- Nevermind.

26:42.712 --> 26:44.146
How about my prisoners?

26:44.180 --> 26:45.681
Oh, I'll have 'em right up.

26:53.756 --> 26:54.890
Hey.

26:54.924 --> 26:55.925
Hey.

26:57.059 --> 26:58.127
You.

26:59.061 --> 27:00.262
What are you guys in for?

27:02.598 --> 27:05.668
It appears we're in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

27:09.338 --> 27:12.041
All right, boys.
Time to rise and shine.

27:12.074 --> 27:14.243
Got a call from your theater
group this afternoon.

27:14.276 --> 27:16.078
They sent a van
to pick you up,

27:16.112 --> 27:18.147
take you over to
the Lost Colony Playhouse.

27:19.081 --> 27:20.182
Let's go.

27:40.669 --> 27:42.838
Welcome. I'm Betsy.

27:42.872 --> 27:44.607
I mean, Constance.

27:44.640 --> 27:48.677
And I guess I am your hostess,
driver, and tour guide.

27:48.711 --> 27:50.613
Anyway, it's lovely
to have you here.

27:52.948 --> 27:56.652
And I am at your service,
Miss Constance.

27:56.685 --> 27:57.720
Oh?

27:57.753 --> 27:59.688
Um, everybody get together.

27:59.722 --> 28:01.590
I want to take your
picture for the program.

28:01.624 --> 28:03.592
- What?
- I beg your pardon, miss?

28:03.626 --> 28:05.161
I want to take
your photograph.

28:05.194 --> 28:06.996
Scooch together
so I can see everyone.

28:07.997 --> 28:09.832
One, two, three.

28:11.901 --> 28:13.235
Oh, wonderful.

28:13.269 --> 28:14.804
Let's go.

28:14.837 --> 28:15.871
Come along.

28:18.074 --> 28:19.708
This way.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.321
- Hello, Father.
- Hello.

28:32.354 --> 28:36.625
Look, we brought you your
favorite, devil's fruitcake.

28:36.659 --> 28:38.894
We all have our weaknesses.

28:38.928 --> 28:40.162
Yes we do.

28:47.404 --> 28:48.804
It's official.

28:48.838 --> 28:49.972
I'm going vegan.

28:52.274 --> 28:54.743
Wow. A real treasure map.

28:54.777 --> 28:56.679
What would be buried in there?

28:56.712 --> 28:57.913
Treasure, you dope.

28:57.947 --> 29:00.049
I know, but like, what kind?

29:00.082 --> 29:03.719
Gold, diamonds, rubies, gold?

29:04.220 --> 29:05.988
You said gold twice.

29:06.021 --> 29:08.357
I like gold.

29:08.391 --> 29:10.059
Hey, what time is?

29:10.092 --> 29:11.293
I'm starving.

29:15.231 --> 29:17.133
I thought you went vegan?

29:17.166 --> 29:18.667
It's gluten free.

29:18.701 --> 29:19.935
Well, it's not "free" free.

29:19.969 --> 29:21.170
You're gonna have
to pay for that.

29:21.203 --> 29:22.204
I'm good for it.

29:24.807 --> 29:28.177
You guys didn't tell anyone
about the map, did you?

29:28.911 --> 29:30.112
You're so paranoid.

29:30.146 --> 29:31.981
No one knows about
the map, but us.

29:33.149 --> 29:35.217
What's this about a map then?

29:35.251 --> 29:37.820
Nothing, Professor.

29:37.853 --> 29:40.322
Yeah. We were
just working on a...

29:40.356 --> 29:43.826
Visitor's map
for the Town Square.

29:43.859 --> 29:46.262
You know, there's so many
treasures to be found.

29:46.295 --> 29:51.800
The Nautical Museum
and the library?

29:52.168 --> 29:53.403
Really?

29:53.436 --> 29:57.006
I'd be obliged
to offer you my expertise.

29:59.108 --> 30:01.310
How's your mom then, Joshua?

30:02.945 --> 30:04.213
Fine.

30:04.246 --> 30:06.982
Do give her my regards,
won't you?

30:08.951 --> 30:09.985
Yeah.

30:10.920 --> 30:12.721
Okay.

30:15.157 --> 30:16.225
Weird.

30:16.258 --> 30:18.160
He took your dad's job,
and then...

30:18.194 --> 30:19.929
now he's trying
to make moves on your mom.

30:19.962 --> 30:22.465
Good luck with that.

30:27.036 --> 30:28.170
Here we are.

30:28.204 --> 30:29.205
Your chariot awaits.

30:30.105 --> 30:31.373
Where are the horses?

30:47.990 --> 30:50.259
You're just gonna love it here.

30:50.292 --> 30:52.995
I've been involved with
the Colony since I was 12.

30:53.028 --> 30:54.129
My family's from here, too.

30:54.163 --> 30:56.165
My ancestors came
over from England

30:56.198 --> 30:58.000
and settled right
here in Pirate's Cove.

30:58.033 --> 31:00.470
Now, if I could
just locate my keys,

31:00.503 --> 31:02.238
we could get going.

31:02.271 --> 31:04.273
Anyway, call me a romantic,

31:04.306 --> 31:07.477
but I love the gallantry,
the chivalry.

31:07.510 --> 31:09.011
Don't get me wrong,
this place is fine,

31:09.044 --> 31:10.480
but sometimes I wish
I could've lived back

31:10.513 --> 31:12.081
in the 18th century.

31:13.516 --> 31:16.218
Um, excuse me, ma'am?

31:17.186 --> 31:18.388
What year might this be?

31:18.421 --> 31:20.956
You really take
the acting thing seriously.

31:42.011 --> 31:43.446
The map, it's gone.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.347
I bet it was
that snake Byron.

31:45.382 --> 31:47.016
Yeah.
Let's go get him.

31:47.049 --> 31:49.818
Hold your horses.
It was just your aunt, see?

31:50.420 --> 31:51.521
Who's Constance?

31:51.554 --> 31:53.255
That's Betsy.

31:53.956 --> 31:54.990
Oh.

31:55.024 --> 31:56.125
That's a relief.

31:56.158 --> 31:57.527
But we still have
to get that map back

31:57.560 --> 31:59.361
before anyone else sees it.
Come on.

32:02.432 --> 32:03.899
All right.

32:03.932 --> 32:05.334
I guess we'll do it from there.

32:05.367 --> 32:07.269
So let's give it a go.

32:07.303 --> 32:11.106
Well, blast ye then,
ye scoundrels.

32:11.140 --> 32:13.610
Aye, blast ye.

32:13.643 --> 32:16.345
No, guys. Come on.

32:16.379 --> 32:18.147
You're pirates.

32:18.180 --> 32:20.550
Where's the emotion? Okay?

32:20.583 --> 32:22.452
Be pirates.

32:22.485 --> 32:23.952
Okay. Again.

32:25.388 --> 32:28.391
Well, blast ye then,
ye scoundrel.

32:29.258 --> 32:30.427
Aye.

32:30.460 --> 32:32.361
Blast ye!

32:37.232 --> 32:38.267
Okay.

32:38.300 --> 32:40.035
Um, all right.

32:45.408 --> 32:46.509
Hi.

32:46.543 --> 32:48.210
Sorry I took so long.

32:48.243 --> 32:50.112
That's okay. Oh, good.

32:50.145 --> 32:52.515
- Oh, these are so great.
- Mmm-hmm.

32:52.549 --> 32:54.484
Thank you. I'm glad
you found these.

32:56.085 --> 32:58.455
These are
the new actors from Raleigh.

32:58.488 --> 32:59.589
Aren't they cute?

32:59.622 --> 33:01.424
Oh, they look like pirates.

33:01.458 --> 33:03.426
Yes. And they really
have the accents down.

33:03.460 --> 33:06.362
Mr. Pistol, this is our
director, Victoria Dare.

33:06.396 --> 33:08.964
It is a pleasure
to meet you, Miss Dare.

33:08.997 --> 33:10.332
Oh.

33:10.366 --> 33:12.167
It's actually missus.

33:12.201 --> 33:13.636
My condolences.

33:13.670 --> 33:15.104
Oh?

33:15.137 --> 33:17.373
Please, allow me
to introduce my crew.

33:17.407 --> 33:19.975
Arr.

33:20.008 --> 33:21.511
This is more like it.

33:21.544 --> 33:23.580
They look like pirates
even down to their teeth.

33:23.613 --> 33:24.980
Mmm-hmm.

33:25.013 --> 33:26.483
Arr!

33:31.286 --> 33:33.021
You guys are gonna
be perfect for this.

33:33.055 --> 33:34.256
Um, all right. Great.

33:34.289 --> 33:36.125
Why don't you go
with Betsy and she'll

33:36.158 --> 33:38.461
get you guys some scripts
and then we can go through it?

33:38.495 --> 33:42.965
In fact, we are not
masters of the written word,

33:42.998 --> 33:47.437
but we could employ
some improvisation.

33:47.470 --> 33:49.672
I love improv,
so I cannot wait to see

33:49.706 --> 33:51.306
what you guys are gonna do.

33:51.340 --> 33:53.510
Those are the guys
from the beach.

33:53.543 --> 33:55.612
All right.
Why don't you go with her?

33:58.715 --> 34:01.618
I'm gonna go get the map.
You guys meet me at the exit.

34:01.651 --> 34:02.918
All right?

34:10.192 --> 34:11.226
Hi, Mom.

34:11.260 --> 34:12.595
Hey, kiddo.

34:12.629 --> 34:14.564
Oh, how was
the treasure hunting?

34:15.432 --> 34:16.499
What?

34:16.533 --> 34:19.101
Oh, I ran into Hubert's dad
at the ice cream shop,

34:19.134 --> 34:20.603
and he said you guys took out

34:20.637 --> 34:22.505
his old metal detector
on the beach.

34:22.539 --> 34:24.339
Oh, yeah.

34:24.373 --> 34:25.708
No treasure yet.

34:25.742 --> 34:27.142
Oh, well the next time.

34:27.176 --> 34:28.043
Yeah.

34:28.076 --> 34:30.112
By the way, do you know
what Betsy did

34:30.145 --> 34:32.014
with the stuff
from the tree house?

34:32.047 --> 34:34.684
There was just a map
and we were just going

34:34.717 --> 34:36.619
to make a tourist map
for the mayor.

34:36.653 --> 34:38.488
Oh, that sounds like fun.

34:38.521 --> 34:40.255
Is there anything
I can do to help?

34:40.289 --> 34:42.492
Yeah. Did you see
the map anywhere?

34:42.525 --> 34:43.426
Uh, oh, you know what?

34:43.460 --> 34:45.695
Check this box that
Betsy just brought.

34:45.728 --> 34:47.095
It might be in there.

34:54.504 --> 34:55.538
Thanks, Mom.

34:55.572 --> 34:57.139
- Bye.
- Bye.

34:58.106 --> 34:59.374
Mmm-hmm.

35:07.717 --> 35:10.085
Jeffrey. The map.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.522
Come on.

35:14.524 --> 35:15.525
Go.

35:16.759 --> 35:17.861
Here are the scripts.

35:17.894 --> 35:20.396
Why don't we call it a day
and go over them tomorrow?

35:20.430 --> 35:21.798
Victoria's information
is on the script

35:21.831 --> 35:23.500
if you have any questions.

35:26.469 --> 35:27.737
- Aye, ma'am.
- Excellent.

35:27.770 --> 35:29.405
Oh, and if you need
a place to sleep,

35:29.439 --> 35:30.773
you can use the cots
up on the balcony.

35:44.621 --> 35:45.788
One for you,

35:46.589 --> 35:48.123
one for you,

35:48.791 --> 35:50.292
one for you,

35:50.325 --> 35:52.529
and a mixed greens salad for me.

35:54.764 --> 35:55.765
It's good.

35:57.332 --> 35:59.602
You guys, I feel like
we're being watched.

35:59.636 --> 36:01.471
You're paranoid.

36:01.504 --> 36:02.639
- Boo!
- Ah!

36:02.672 --> 36:03.740
I knew it.

36:03.773 --> 36:05.475
What do you want, Byron?

36:05.508 --> 36:07.477
Just a friendly reminder
for you, Hubert.

36:08.444 --> 36:09.779
It's the second.

36:09.812 --> 36:12.114
Tell your dad rent
was due yesterday.

36:12.815 --> 36:14.349
The check's in the mail.

36:14.784 --> 36:16.452
I hope so.

36:16.486 --> 36:18.320
We don't want to
charge you a late fee.

36:19.622 --> 36:22.157
See you later, losers.

36:24.761 --> 36:26.328
Let's get outta here.

36:26.361 --> 36:27.463
What about my salad?

36:27.497 --> 36:28.498
Come on.

36:49.719 --> 36:50.820
Cool.

36:50.853 --> 36:52.589
You see that
drawing of where that fort is?

36:52.622 --> 36:54.390
That's right where
City Hall is today.

36:56.291 --> 36:58.561
- Hedge!
- Aw, my lemonade!

36:58.595 --> 36:59.796
Nice one, Hedge!

36:59.829 --> 37:01.397
Sorry.

37:02.865 --> 37:04.667
Hedge, you're a genius.

37:04.701 --> 37:05.602
I am?

37:05.635 --> 37:07.837
It's invisible ink.
The alpha!

37:07.870 --> 37:10.773
"They voyager points to
where me shanty rings true,

37:10.807 --> 37:12.642
"and fills the air
on summer's day

37:12.675 --> 37:14.343
"with dreams of gold

37:14.376 --> 37:16.846
"that blossom visions
from days of old."

37:16.879 --> 37:18.246
- Cool.
- Nice.

37:33.796 --> 37:35.163
Hey, Earl.

37:36.298 --> 37:37.600
Mornin', sis.

37:37.634 --> 37:39.435
Huh.

37:39.469 --> 37:42.438
Uh, there's only
one "L" in gala.

37:43.906 --> 37:45.408
Dang it.

37:45.441 --> 37:47.710
Yeah. You might
want to change it.

37:47.744 --> 37:49.344
See you later.

38:05.495 --> 38:06.929
Through it to Christa Port.

38:06.963 --> 38:08.230
Aye.

38:10.265 --> 38:11.567
- Fire!
- Ah!

38:17.540 --> 38:20.275
Aren't you guys
a little old for this?

38:20.308 --> 38:21.577
Arr.

38:24.346 --> 38:26.516
<i>Step right up
and pick your best shot.</i>

38:26.549 --> 38:28.451
<i>Ring the bell, win the prize.</i>

38:42.031 --> 38:43.766
<i>Another lucky winner!</i>

38:43.800 --> 38:45.333
<i>Pick your prize.</i>

38:47.837 --> 38:49.271
That one.

38:56.746 --> 38:57.780
Oh.

39:06.756 --> 39:08.323
This is so unfair.

39:14.296 --> 39:16.666
Okay, these numbers
don't make any sense.

39:16.699 --> 39:18.801
If you go by
the latitudes and longitudes,

39:18.835 --> 39:22.438
you would end up
in Machu Picchu, Peru.

39:22.472 --> 39:23.773
Must be a decoy.

39:23.806 --> 39:25.742
There are
four signatures here.

39:25.775 --> 39:29.645
Collins, Byers,
Demuse, and Kidd.

39:29.679 --> 39:30.980
William Kidd?

39:31.013 --> 39:33.783
This is the map to the treasure
of Captain Kidd.

39:33.816 --> 39:35.952
Wow.

39:35.985 --> 39:38.755
Wait, why would pirates
have signed this map?

39:39.756 --> 39:41.624
Let me see that.

39:41.657 --> 39:43.025
It's a pact.

39:43.059 --> 39:44.160
What do you mean?

39:44.193 --> 39:46.662
It's just like the backstory
in <i>Quest for Riches.</i>

39:46.696 --> 39:49.297
Whoever signed this had
a share in the treasure.

39:49.331 --> 39:50.700
You see this?

39:50.733 --> 39:53.936
Four names,
four pieces to the puzzle.

39:53.970 --> 39:56.639
I'll bet each of the pirates
have their own piece

39:56.672 --> 39:58.441
in a secret hiding place,

39:58.474 --> 40:00.610
and you can't find the treasure
without all four pieces.

40:00.643 --> 40:01.811
Impressive.

40:12.388 --> 40:13.656
Whoa.

40:14.757 --> 40:15.925
Check this out.

40:24.734 --> 40:26.869
Hey, let me see that.

40:26.903 --> 40:29.572
I swear I've seen this before.

40:30.807 --> 40:32.340
Wait a second.

40:33.643 --> 40:34.677
I've got it.

40:34.710 --> 40:35.845
Come on.

40:48.491 --> 40:52.495
Sheriff, I was only parked
there for two minutes.

40:52.528 --> 40:56.766
It's clearly posted,
"no parking".

40:56.799 --> 40:58.634
Is there
no way around this?

40:59.836 --> 41:01.737
Okay, just this once.

41:01.771 --> 41:03.806
- Thank you, sheriff.
- Sure.

41:09.779 --> 41:10.847
Hey, Uncle Herm.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.448
Hey, kids.

41:34.070 --> 41:36.505
Ugh!

41:36.539 --> 41:37.940
Ooh.

41:38.674 --> 41:39.709
Got something?

41:39.742 --> 41:40.910
Check this out.

41:40.943 --> 41:43.613
So cool.

41:43.646 --> 41:46.549
Come on, Brig.
We've been here for hours.

41:46.582 --> 41:47.817
Sorry.

41:47.850 --> 41:50.019
I swear I saw one of
those things here.

41:50.052 --> 41:51.821
Maybe somebody else took it.

41:54.824 --> 41:55.958
Bye, Uncle Herm.

41:55.992 --> 41:57.860
Yeah, later.

42:28.824 --> 42:30.092
Hey, Marge.

42:34.030 --> 42:35.164
Is it time?

42:36.966 --> 42:38.734
Just the nails.

42:38.768 --> 42:40.503
Step into my office

42:40.536 --> 42:42.838
and Margie's gonna
fix you all up.

42:47.777 --> 42:49.946
All right now, into the drink.

42:49.979 --> 42:52.214
Oh, you may want
to take off your ring, though.

42:52.248 --> 42:53.582
Might get tarnished.

42:53.616 --> 42:55.084
Oh no. It's okay.
It's fine.

42:55.117 --> 42:57.787
Oh, all right.
Well, suit yourself.

42:59.722 --> 43:01.023
Can we talk frankly?

43:02.625 --> 43:03.693
Sure.

43:04.627 --> 43:06.128
You know I love you,

43:06.162 --> 43:09.832
and I would never want
to cause you any distress,

43:10.933 --> 43:13.069
but it's been five years.

43:13.102 --> 43:15.071
It's time you moved on
with your life,

43:15.104 --> 43:16.806
for you and for Josh.

43:16.839 --> 43:18.908
Yeah, I know. I know.

43:18.941 --> 43:22.178
Oh. Oh, let's
not even go there.

43:22.211 --> 43:24.180
Just forget
I said anything.

43:24.213 --> 43:27.016
Like my momma always told me,

43:27.049 --> 43:29.552
you should always think twice
before you open your mouth.

43:29.585 --> 43:31.821
Well, I should've
listened to her.

43:31.854 --> 43:33.622
Would have helped
with the relationships

43:33.656 --> 43:34.857
and my waistline.

43:35.992 --> 43:37.693
Oh, there's my girl.

43:38.761 --> 43:40.529
So how's the play coming along?

43:40.563 --> 43:41.697
Fine.

43:41.731 --> 43:43.632
I mean we have some actors
that came down from Raleigh

43:43.666 --> 43:45.134
and they're actually
really good.

43:45.167 --> 43:46.769
So I heard.

43:47.303 --> 43:48.704
Marge?

43:48.738 --> 43:51.173
Eh, oh, I just
heard they were good.

43:52.942 --> 43:54.110
And cute.

43:55.277 --> 43:56.912
Oh, there's a hangnail.

43:56.946 --> 43:58.714
Let me take care of that.

43:58.748 --> 44:00.549
You're terrible.

44:06.589 --> 44:07.857
<i>What are
you gonna do with</i>

44:07.890 --> 44:09.191
<i>your share
of the loot, Brigitte?</i>

44:09.225 --> 44:11.027
I'm gonna build a new library

44:11.060 --> 44:13.095
and fill it with every
book in the world.

44:13.129 --> 44:14.263
Boring.

44:14.296 --> 44:16.032
How about you, Chip?

44:16.065 --> 44:17.666
I'm gonna make movies.

44:17.700 --> 44:18.734
Nice.

44:20.136 --> 44:22.038
Hey Josh, what about you?

44:22.872 --> 44:24.073
Earth to Josh.

44:24.106 --> 44:26.275
What? What did you say?

44:26.308 --> 44:28.844
I said, what are you gonna do
with your share of the treasure?

44:28.878 --> 44:31.981
I think I'll buy a big
sailboat like my dad's.

44:32.014 --> 44:34.917
He always wanted
to sail around the world.

44:34.950 --> 44:36.986
It was a dream of
he and my mom's.

44:37.019 --> 44:38.654
Yeah, that's cool.

44:38.687 --> 44:40.089
I think I'm gonna
open my own chain

44:40.122 --> 44:42.124
of ice cream stores
across the country.

44:42.158 --> 44:45.694
Not frozen yogurt,
the real McCoy,

44:45.728 --> 44:47.630
with every flavor
you can think of

44:47.663 --> 44:48.864
and all kinds of toppings.

44:49.899 --> 44:53.869
Hot fudge, caramel,
gummy bears.

44:53.903 --> 44:56.705
Hello, Mr. Wonka?

44:56.739 --> 44:57.807
What?

44:57.840 --> 45:00.676
First we have to
find the treasure.

45:00.709 --> 45:02.278
Right.

45:02.311 --> 45:04.914
Come on. We're gonna
be late for the meeting.

45:09.118 --> 45:10.953
I wonder what's going on.

45:10.986 --> 45:13.055
I don't know,
but it must be pretty big,

45:13.089 --> 45:15.658
'cause my dad never
goes to these things.

45:15.691 --> 45:16.926
Same here.

45:24.700 --> 45:27.770
Okay, let's get this started.

45:27.803 --> 45:30.739
First of all, I would like
to commend Father O'Reilly

45:30.773 --> 45:33.075
at another successful
fundraiser for the orphanage.

45:34.777 --> 45:36.278
Go Father,
you're the best.

45:39.148 --> 45:41.717
And now about those
recent burglaries.

45:41.750 --> 45:43.018
Somebody took the anchor

45:43.052 --> 45:44.753
right out the front
porch of my store.

45:45.955 --> 45:48.090
And the ship's bell was
stolen from the church tower.

45:49.191 --> 45:52.661
And the spy glass is
missing from Spyglass Point.

45:53.896 --> 45:56.132
All right, all right,
calm down.

45:57.233 --> 45:59.135
Sheriff Basnight
is on top of this,

45:59.168 --> 46:02.204
and I am sure that the culprits
will be apprehended soon.

46:02.238 --> 46:03.305
Sheriff?

46:03.339 --> 46:05.040
We're working on a few leads.

46:07.209 --> 46:10.012
Now, onto the main
reason for this meeting.

46:11.881 --> 46:13.983
We have, after much debate,

46:14.016 --> 46:17.786
made a decision
to make a change

46:17.820 --> 46:21.190
that will boost the local
economy exponentially.

46:22.224 --> 46:23.759
May we dim the lights please?

46:25.395 --> 46:27.397
As you know,

46:27.430 --> 46:30.833
the treasure hunting theme
has lost its luster,

46:30.866 --> 46:34.103
mainly because nobody has ever
found any treasure here.

46:36.473 --> 46:40.209
Tourism is at
an all-time low, but,

46:40.242 --> 46:42.912
thanks to an agreement with
the Beecher Family Trust,

46:42.945 --> 46:45.114
that is all going to change.

46:46.282 --> 46:50.487
I present to you
Beecher's Dinoworld!

46:52.288 --> 46:54.156
- What?
- What is that?

46:57.092 --> 46:59.429
We are projecting
an increase of revenue

46:59.462 --> 47:01.864
of over 400% within
the first year alone

47:01.897 --> 47:03.400
and the sky is the limit.

47:03.433 --> 47:05.167
No, it's ridiculous.

47:05.201 --> 47:06.936
It's been the same location
for 20 years.

47:06.969 --> 47:08.237
What about the theater?

47:08.270 --> 47:10.839
We put so much time
and money into that place.

47:10.873 --> 47:12.775
All of the existing businesses

47:12.808 --> 47:16.278
will be incorporated
into the new theme,

47:16.312 --> 47:18.214
maybe relocated a bit.

47:18.247 --> 47:20.950
But the town's
called Pirate's Cove.

47:20.983 --> 47:22.351
That's where the pirates
really were,

47:22.385 --> 47:24.053
and it's part of our history.

47:25.187 --> 47:27.256
She's right, and I say, boo.

47:27.289 --> 47:29.992
Yeah, boo.

47:39.101 --> 47:40.803
Now we really need
to find the treasure.

47:59.522 --> 48:03.192
"According to historians,
William Captain Kidd

48:03.225 --> 48:04.827
was a Scottish
sailor who was tried

48:04.860 --> 48:07.564
and executed for piracy
after returning home

48:07.597 --> 48:09.532
from a voyage
to the Indian Ocean.

48:09.566 --> 48:11.800
Treasure seekers have
searched the waters

48:11.834 --> 48:14.870
off of North Carolina
for almost 200 years

48:14.903 --> 48:16.972
in hopes of locating
his stash of treasure

48:17.006 --> 48:18.441
from his piracy raids
up and down

48:18.475 --> 48:20.276
the pre-colonial coastline.

48:20.309 --> 48:22.845
Accounts from those who
claimed to sailed with him

48:22.878 --> 48:24.913
described him as
a brilliant strategist,

48:24.947 --> 48:26.449
mathematician, and navigator.

48:26.483 --> 48:28.183
He was subsequently captured,

48:28.217 --> 48:30.352
but his treasure was
never recovered."

48:30.387 --> 48:31.554
Check this out.

48:31.588 --> 48:34.890
According to this,
Saint Brendan of Clonfert

48:34.923 --> 48:37.026
was known as
Brendan the Voyager,

48:37.059 --> 48:40.963
the patron sate of sailors,
navigators, and whales.

48:40.996 --> 48:42.064
That's cool,
but what does that

48:42.097 --> 48:43.265
have to do with the treasurer?

48:43.299 --> 48:44.401
Look familiar?

48:44.434 --> 48:45.602
Doesn't that look just

48:45.635 --> 48:47.970
like the statue
in the Town Square?

48:48.003 --> 48:49.038
Right.

48:49.071 --> 48:51.608
The original statute was
pointing toward the ocean,

48:51.641 --> 48:53.510
but this statue is
pointing towards the...

48:53.543 --> 48:55.010
Church?

49:13.128 --> 49:14.129
Anything?

49:15.598 --> 49:17.966
Yeah, pretty sure
it's a church.

49:20.269 --> 49:22.572
28 pews and no clues.

49:22.605 --> 49:24.873
It all looks pretty standard.

49:41.090 --> 49:44.427
"The Voyager points
to where me shanty rings true,

49:44.461 --> 49:46.596
"and fills the air
on summer's day

49:46.629 --> 49:48.030
"with dreams of gold

49:48.063 --> 49:50.633
"that blossom visions
from days of old."

49:54.336 --> 49:56.271
Shanty means song.

49:57.072 --> 49:58.508
Summer's day...

50:01.076 --> 50:02.111
Day.

50:22.998 --> 50:25.267
"My name was William Kidd,

50:25.300 --> 50:27.269
"as I sailed, as I sailed.

50:27.302 --> 50:29.972
"My name was William
Kidd when I sailed.

50:30.005 --> 50:33.976
"My name was William Kidd,
God's laws I did forbid,

50:34.009 --> 50:37.980
"and so wickedly I did,
as I sailed."

50:45.688 --> 50:47.022
Hey, guys?

51:07.644 --> 51:09.178
Hobbs.

51:09.211 --> 51:10.312
Oye, shake a leg.

51:11.046 --> 51:12.080
Silver.

51:12.114 --> 51:13.315
Silver?

51:13.348 --> 51:14.384
All right then, divvy it up.

51:14.417 --> 51:15.452
Divvy it up?

51:15.485 --> 51:16.351
Oh, to eat, bard.

51:16.386 --> 51:18.488
Oye, I could eat
a hot bowl of loblollies.

51:18.521 --> 51:20.355
- Some cackle fruit.
- Warm castle.

51:20.390 --> 51:22.057
Salmagundy.

51:22.090 --> 51:23.992
We'll eat like kings, aye.

51:24.026 --> 51:25.127
- Yes!
- Make haste.

51:40.142 --> 51:41.511
Where is mine?

51:41.544 --> 51:42.679
Uh...

51:42.712 --> 51:45.080
Do you want some of mine?

51:45.113 --> 51:48.183
Listen, I've found a way
to locate the treasure.

51:49.084 --> 51:51.521
Arr! Follow me.

51:57.359 --> 51:58.495
<i>Gather 'round, mateys.</i>

51:58.528 --> 52:00.262
- See?
- <i>For a mere shiny coin,</i>

52:00.295 --> 52:03.500
<i>I shall divulge
the answers you seek.</i>

52:03.533 --> 52:05.167
Mountjoy, give up the silver.

52:05.200 --> 52:06.168
What?

52:06.201 --> 52:08.203
Well, you want to find
the map, don't you, lad?

52:08.237 --> 52:10.138
It's a sailor's knowledge tax.

52:10.172 --> 52:12.408
<i>Ask a question,
spin the wheel,</i>

52:12.442 --> 52:15.077
<i>and your answer I shall reveal.</i>

52:18.280 --> 52:20.650
Where is the treasure
that we seek?

52:26.321 --> 52:28.758
Ooh!

52:28.791 --> 52:32.395
"There are many treasures
to be had in Pirate's Cove."

52:33.596 --> 52:35.632
<i>Ask a question,
spin the wheel,</i>

52:35.665 --> 52:39.201
<i>and your answer I shall reveal.</i>

52:39.234 --> 52:40.436
Can you be more specific?

52:40.470 --> 52:41.471
Aye.

52:43.673 --> 52:46.809
Where is the lost treasure
of Captain William Kidd?

52:57.487 --> 53:01.056
"If it's treasure ye seek,
ye will need a map."

53:02.124 --> 53:05.461
Well, thank you,
Captain Obvious.

53:05.495 --> 53:07.329
<i>Ask a question,
spin the wheel,</i>

53:07.362 --> 53:10.265
<i>and your answer I shall reveal.</i>

53:10.299 --> 53:12.735
Can you please tell us exactly

53:12.769 --> 53:16.739
where the treasure of Captain
William Kidd be hiding?

53:25.782 --> 53:29.318
"In order to find
the treasures of this world,

53:29.351 --> 53:31.688
"one must look
within their heart?"

53:32.522 --> 53:33.623
- Son of a...
- Blast!

53:33.656 --> 53:35.558
Aye, we've been bamboozled.

53:38.360 --> 53:39.462
Look!

53:39.495 --> 53:41.163
Hello?

53:42.164 --> 53:43.600
Oh, hi, Aunt Vicky.

53:43.633 --> 53:45.568
Yes, Josh is right here.

53:45.602 --> 53:48.236
It's those rapscallions
with our map!

53:49.839 --> 53:53.509
<i>Come back, me hardys,
I was just having a little fun.</i>

53:53.543 --> 53:55.243
<i>I'll tell you where
the treasure is.</i>

53:59.682 --> 54:01.484
See you in a bit.

54:01.517 --> 54:02.819
I gotta head home.

54:02.852 --> 54:04.520
Yeah, I should be going, too.

54:04.554 --> 54:05.622
All right, we'll talk later.

54:05.655 --> 54:07.155
Okay.

54:07.189 --> 54:09.559
- What now?
- We wait for Pistol.

54:09.592 --> 54:10.893
He'll get the map.

54:55.370 --> 54:56.673
Is anyone there?

54:58.240 --> 54:59.241
Hello?

55:01.678 --> 55:03.946
Good evening, Ms. Victoria.

55:03.980 --> 55:06.382
Uh, Jeffrey...

55:07.617 --> 55:09.819
Uh, what are you doing here?

55:09.852 --> 55:12.455
I was thinking about
some of the things

55:12.488 --> 55:14.724
you mentioned earlier,

55:14.757 --> 55:17.560
and was hoping that we could

55:17.593 --> 55:21.229
discuss some
elements of the play.

55:22.330 --> 55:24.534
That is,
if now is a good time?

55:24.567 --> 55:26.402
Ah, you know what?
Now's a great time.

55:26.436 --> 55:28.738
We're just getting ready
to sit down for dinner.

55:28.771 --> 55:30.238
Would you like to join us?

55:31.974 --> 55:33.676
Yes.

55:33.710 --> 55:34.944
Thank you for the invitation.

55:34.977 --> 55:36.512
You're welcome. Come in.

55:41.818 --> 55:43.251
Well, make yourself at home.

55:43.285 --> 55:45.421
I'm just gonna go
uh, freshen up.

55:45.455 --> 55:46.489
Cheers.

56:12.815 --> 56:13.916
Uh, Professor.

56:13.950 --> 56:17.487
I found myself in the proximity
of your neighborhood

56:17.520 --> 56:19.822
and felt compelled
without provocation

56:19.856 --> 56:21.256
to call upon you.

56:21.891 --> 56:23.626
Ah, uh...

56:26.328 --> 56:28.363
Ah.

56:28.397 --> 56:31.734
I see presently
occupied with company.

56:33.368 --> 56:35.638
Yes I am. I'm sorry.

56:35.671 --> 56:38.508
Perhaps another
time, Ms. Victoria.

56:38.541 --> 56:40.743
Yes. Another time
would be lovely.

56:41.410 --> 56:42.745
Very well.

56:48.885 --> 56:51.888
Thank you.
It was a fine meal.

56:51.921 --> 56:54.356
You're welcome.
Room for dessert?

56:54.390 --> 56:55.525
I made pie.

56:55.558 --> 56:57.660
I am stuffed to the britches.

56:58.694 --> 57:00.596
Coffee, tea?

57:00.630 --> 57:02.465
Tea, please.

57:03.966 --> 57:05.935
Josh, where have you been?

57:05.968 --> 57:07.703
Josh, this is Jeffrey.

57:07.737 --> 57:09.772
Honey, I saved a plate
for you for dinner.

57:09.806 --> 57:11.007
I just need to wash up.

57:14.844 --> 57:15.778
Sorry about that.

57:15.812 --> 57:18.681
He's been uncomfortable
having people over

57:18.714 --> 57:20.750
since his father was lost
at sea five years ago.

57:20.783 --> 57:23.553
It's hard for a boy
to not have his dad around.

57:25.621 --> 57:26.722
Yes.

57:27.590 --> 57:28.591
Yes, it is.

57:36.799 --> 57:38.100
Come on.

57:38.134 --> 57:39.569
Come on.

57:39.602 --> 57:40.570
<i>Hello?</i>

57:40.603 --> 57:43.739
- Brig, big problems.
- <i>What's going on?</i>

57:43.773 --> 57:46.609
One of the actor pirate guys
came over for dinner.

57:46.642 --> 57:49.011
<i>OMG. Where is he now?</i>

57:49.045 --> 57:50.179
He's still in the house.

57:50.213 --> 57:52.748
I gotta get back inside before
they come looking for me.

57:52.782 --> 57:55.017
<i>Whatever you do,
don't act suspicious</i>

57:55.051 --> 57:57.486
<i>and don't let him see the map.</i>

57:57.520 --> 57:58.521
Really?

58:18.608 --> 58:21.577
There's your
new course, Mr. Pistol.

58:21.611 --> 58:22.812
Straight off the plank.

58:22.845 --> 58:23.980
No!

58:40.696 --> 58:41.998
Here's your tea.

58:45.835 --> 58:46.969
I'm sorry, I...

58:49.605 --> 58:50.706
I have to go.

59:31.147 --> 59:32.448
Happy birthday, son.

59:33.916 --> 59:35.051
Dad!

59:38.054 --> 59:40.089
Josh. What's wrong?

59:42.892 --> 59:45.027
It was... it was Dad.

59:45.061 --> 59:48.998
He was in his boat
and there was a terrible storm.

59:49.031 --> 59:51.000
Oh, honey, you had a bad dream.

59:52.902 --> 59:54.070
I'm so sorry.

59:55.538 --> 59:56.772
You'll be okay.

59:58.574 --> 1:00:00.543
Try to go back to sleep, okay?

1:00:01.944 --> 1:00:03.245
All right, goodnight.

1:00:19.161 --> 1:00:20.596
<i>Josh, you up?</i>

1:00:20.629 --> 1:00:21.931
Yeah.

1:00:21.964 --> 1:00:23.799
<i>People are posting they saw
the lighthouse being turned on.</i>

1:00:23.833 --> 1:00:25.034
<i>It might be a clue.</i>

1:00:25.067 --> 1:00:28.170
<i>Meet us at the entrance
to the lighthouse trail in 20.</i>

1:00:29.171 --> 1:00:30.172
Okay.

1:00:53.996 --> 1:00:55.865
That thing hasn't
been turned on in years.

1:00:57.099 --> 1:00:58.300
You guys spread out.

1:00:58.334 --> 1:01:00.102
Look for clues.

1:01:00.136 --> 1:01:01.871
I'll go check out
the light house.

1:02:08.838 --> 1:02:11.707
"On clouded night
by beacon's light,

1:02:11.740 --> 1:02:13.142
"the secret shall be known,

1:02:14.310 --> 1:02:17.313
"reflected from
the foe of night,

1:02:17.346 --> 1:02:19.115
"beneath a skull and bones."

1:02:52.382 --> 1:02:53.383
Booyah!

1:03:23.212 --> 1:03:26.215
Ay, ay, ay,
what a cruel fate, bruh.

1:03:26.248 --> 1:03:27.816
- Yeah.
- Yes now.

1:03:27.850 --> 1:03:30.886
At least we left
him the ship, eh?

1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:32.221
That's not how it happened.

1:03:32.988 --> 1:03:34.123
No?

1:03:34.156 --> 1:03:37.092
Oh, a hundred men sailed
the <i>Matador</i> that night.

1:03:37.126 --> 1:03:39.261
Took two cannon balls port side,

1:03:39.295 --> 1:03:40.829
and then they arrived.

1:03:42.198 --> 1:03:46.802
13 tiger sharks
and a giant squid,

1:03:46.835 --> 1:03:49.838
and the men screaming
for their dear lives.

1:03:51.173 --> 1:03:53.209
Oh, hello, Jeffrey.

1:03:53.242 --> 1:03:54.276
Did you get the map?

1:03:54.310 --> 1:03:57.179
No, but I know where it is.

1:03:57.213 --> 1:03:59.416
We just have to wait
for the opportunity to arise.

1:04:02.885 --> 1:04:03.919
What in God's name is this?

1:04:03.953 --> 1:04:05.488
Oh, it's a magical little story

1:04:05.522 --> 1:04:08.458
about the tiny little people
running about inside.

1:04:08.491 --> 1:04:09.858
Completely unhinged.

1:04:10.427 --> 1:04:11.860
Huh.

1:04:12.828 --> 1:04:14.163
He rather looks like you.

1:04:14.196 --> 1:04:15.297
- No.
- Yeah.

1:04:15.331 --> 1:04:16.433
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he does.

1:04:16.466 --> 1:04:17.467
Quite handsome.

1:04:39.154 --> 1:04:40.155
Marge.

1:04:40.889 --> 1:04:41.924
It's time.

1:04:43.092 --> 1:04:44.293
Time for what, dear?

1:04:46.496 --> 1:04:47.796
Something new.

1:04:51.967 --> 1:04:53.068
Oh, my.

1:04:54.303 --> 1:04:55.971
All right, girls,
shop's closed.

1:04:56.005 --> 1:04:57.106
Everybody out.

1:04:57.139 --> 1:04:59.008
Come on,
let's move it along here.

1:04:59.041 --> 1:05:00.976
Come on, everybody out.

1:05:01.010 --> 1:05:02.311
What about my curlers?

1:05:02.344 --> 1:05:03.912
Oh, just take 'em out
when you get home.

1:05:03.946 --> 1:05:05.347
Come on now. Move along.

1:05:05.382 --> 1:05:06.416
- Scooch it.
- Marge...

1:05:06.449 --> 1:05:08.183
Roll along. There we go.

1:05:08.217 --> 1:05:09.318
Buh-bye now.

1:05:09.351 --> 1:05:13.222
And you, come into my office

1:05:13.255 --> 1:05:16.459
and Margie's gonna
make you feel great.

1:05:41.083 --> 1:05:44.286
Chip? What's that for?

1:05:44.320 --> 1:05:46.088
The treasure, you dope.

1:05:49.592 --> 1:05:51.528
It's obviously the right place.

1:05:53.095 --> 1:05:55.164
These markings
don't make any sense.

1:05:55.197 --> 1:05:57.099
I've got it.
It's a triangulation.

1:05:58.233 --> 1:05:59.268
A what?

1:05:59.301 --> 1:06:01.103
Those numbers are degrees.

1:06:01.136 --> 1:06:02.938
Triangulation uses two points

1:06:02.971 --> 1:06:04.973
and the angles between
them to pinpoint the third.

1:06:05.007 --> 1:06:06.576
You have to use these
geographic markers

1:06:06.609 --> 1:06:08.511
to determine the exact
spot of the treasure.

1:06:08.545 --> 1:06:10.245
I think I have an app for that.

1:06:10.279 --> 1:06:11.481
Cool.

1:06:12.281 --> 1:06:13.383
That one's easy.

1:06:13.416 --> 1:06:14.850
It's right there.

1:06:16.118 --> 1:06:18.555
So then the second
point would be

1:06:18.588 --> 1:06:21.090
right at the top of that ridge.

1:06:21.123 --> 1:06:23.325
But there aren't
any trees over there.

1:06:23.359 --> 1:06:27.096
There has to be a stump
or roots or something.

1:06:27.129 --> 1:06:29.298
All we have to do is figure out
where that tree used to be,

1:06:29.331 --> 1:06:31.934
then we can use the angles
to pinpoint the treasure.

1:06:53.523 --> 1:06:54.990
Do you like it?

1:06:55.023 --> 1:06:57.025
I think it might be
a little over the top.

1:06:58.227 --> 1:06:59.396
You're beautiful.

1:07:02.331 --> 1:07:04.667
I mean, it's beautiful.

1:07:06.034 --> 1:07:07.470
I mean, you're beautiful in it.

1:07:09.037 --> 1:07:11.306
Christ.

1:07:11.340 --> 1:07:16.078
Aww, well, Mr. Pistol,
I think you're blushing.

1:07:16.546 --> 1:07:19.114
No. No, no, I...

1:07:19.148 --> 1:07:21.384
It's just that I've um,
well, I've...

1:07:21.418 --> 1:07:23.085
I've forgotten my...

1:07:24.286 --> 1:07:25.320
Sword.

1:07:25.354 --> 1:07:27.424
My sword.
I've forgotten my sword.

1:07:27.457 --> 1:07:30.926
And now I'm going
to retrieve it.

1:07:32.294 --> 1:07:33.328
That way.

1:07:34.497 --> 1:07:35.665
Forgive me.

1:07:41.438 --> 1:07:43.740
- Blast ye then, ye scoundrels.
- Aye, blast ye.

1:07:43.773 --> 1:07:44.973
Gumption, mate.

1:07:45.742 --> 1:07:47.477
All right, where's Mountjoy?

1:07:47.510 --> 1:07:50.212
Oh, down yonder with
that golden-haired tart.

1:07:51.046 --> 1:07:52.080
Hmm.

1:08:04.293 --> 1:08:06.463
Sorry to interrupt, but we do
have to show to put on here.

1:08:06.496 --> 1:08:07.630
Right, um...

1:08:07.664 --> 1:08:09.264
Of course. I'm... I'm sorry.

1:08:09.298 --> 1:08:10.667
Just give it a minute, love.

1:08:42.699 --> 1:08:43.700
Really?

1:08:44.534 --> 1:08:45.568
What?

1:08:45.602 --> 1:08:48.070
Can you just
concentrate on this?

1:08:48.103 --> 1:08:49.739
This is impossible.

1:08:49.772 --> 1:08:52.408
That tree is long gone,
and there's no way

1:08:52.442 --> 1:08:53.543
that we're gonna find...

1:08:55.778 --> 1:08:57.045
Found it.

1:09:05.421 --> 1:09:06.456
There it is.

1:09:06.489 --> 1:09:07.490
Follow me.

1:09:16.533 --> 1:09:18.033
Look, it's not even locked.

1:09:21.136 --> 1:09:22.371
Awesome.

1:09:22.405 --> 1:09:23.506
Come on.

1:10:04.146 --> 1:10:08.851
"Here lies the true treasure,
my immortal beloved.

1:10:08.885 --> 1:10:13.823
"Gold or gems could never
equal the joy she gave me."

1:10:15.692 --> 1:10:17.427
Josh, are you buying this?

1:10:17.460 --> 1:10:19.429
- No.
- Me neither.

1:10:19.462 --> 1:10:21.330
All he ever loved was treasure.

1:10:27.269 --> 1:10:28.471
Wait a second.

1:10:37.245 --> 1:10:38.381
I knew it.

1:10:38.414 --> 1:10:39.549
Come on.

1:10:46.188 --> 1:10:47.423
Go ahead, Brigitte.

1:10:47.457 --> 1:10:48.791
What?

1:10:48.825 --> 1:10:50.158
No, you go.

1:10:50.192 --> 1:10:51.360
I'll go first.

1:11:16.519 --> 1:11:17.553
Go.

1:11:17.587 --> 1:11:18.721
I'm going.

1:11:24.694 --> 1:11:26.361
It's just a dead guy in a cage.

1:11:43.980 --> 1:11:45.347
No way.

1:12:01.798 --> 1:12:02.899
Booyah!

1:12:02.932 --> 1:12:04.299
Whoa!

1:12:04.332 --> 1:12:06.636
- OMG!
- Wow.

1:12:06.669 --> 1:12:08.938
Chip, go get that wagon.

1:12:08.971 --> 1:12:10.338
Right.

1:12:16.012 --> 1:12:17.847
Professor Ratliffe?

1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:20.383
At your service.
Good evening, Joshua.

1:12:21.050 --> 1:12:22.719
What are you doing here?

1:12:22.752 --> 1:12:25.888
I'm supposing
the very same as yourself.

1:12:25.922 --> 1:12:27.557
Searching for treasure.

1:12:29.792 --> 1:12:30.760
Evening, losers.

1:12:30.793 --> 1:12:33.696
Ah, Master Beecher,
good of you to join us.

1:12:33.730 --> 1:12:35.832
I knew you had
something to do with this.

1:12:35.865 --> 1:12:37.533
He's been behind
this whole thing.

1:12:37.567 --> 1:12:39.435
Well aren't you the smart one?

1:12:39.469 --> 1:12:41.269
Yes, treasure seeking requires

1:12:41.303 --> 1:12:42.572
a significant cash investment.

1:12:43.506 --> 1:12:45.041
We found the treasure.

1:12:45.074 --> 1:12:46.308
So I see.

1:12:46.341 --> 1:12:48.544
And what a good job
you've done.

1:12:48.578 --> 1:12:50.813
I may have never been able
to recover it without your help.

1:12:50.847 --> 1:12:52.448
It's rightfully ours.

1:12:52.482 --> 1:12:53.750
I beg to differ.

1:12:53.783 --> 1:12:56.819
With all due respect,
I've been in pursuit

1:12:56.853 --> 1:12:58.921
of such treasure
through space and time

1:12:58.955 --> 1:13:01.289
for over 300 years.

1:13:01.323 --> 1:13:04.326
While searching for Captain
William Kidd's lost treasure,

1:13:04.359 --> 1:13:08.431
I come upon a certain
Spanish explorer

1:13:08.464 --> 1:13:12.401
who had a very peculiar
mechanism in his possession.

1:13:12.435 --> 1:13:13.970
<i>Let me guess,
a time machine?</i>

1:13:14.003 --> 1:13:17.774
<i>A time machine, indeed,
and together we'd retrieve all</i>

1:13:17.807 --> 1:13:20.843
<i>of the world's greatest
lost treasures.</i>

1:13:22.779 --> 1:13:26.048
<i>Somehow we learned to manipulate
the space-time continuum.</i>

1:13:26.082 --> 1:13:29.652
Sedillo! What have you done?

1:13:31.521 --> 1:13:34.690
<i>And he sent me forward
into the time vortex.</i>

1:13:34.724 --> 1:13:40.563
Unfortunately, some poor soul
took my place in the past.

1:13:42.364 --> 1:13:45.735
Alas, these mutinous
gents arrived

1:13:45.768 --> 1:13:47.937
on the very ship
from which I came

1:13:49.005 --> 1:13:52.008
with my time machine.

1:13:52.041 --> 1:13:56.813
Once again fate allows me
to take back that which is mine.

1:13:57.613 --> 1:13:59.081
You mean ours?

1:13:59.115 --> 1:14:00.817
If you're done with
the history lesson,

1:14:00.850 --> 1:14:01.951
I'd like to get a move on.

1:14:01.984 --> 1:14:04.020
The ship will be
at the dock in a few minutes.

1:14:04.053 --> 1:14:07.355
Take this treasure
and load it up on the <i>Pandora.</i>

1:14:07.390 --> 1:14:09.458
They'll be taking
the journey with us,

1:14:09.492 --> 1:14:10.793
especially this whale.

1:14:12.128 --> 1:14:13.529
Wait one minute.

1:14:13.563 --> 1:14:14.730
We had a deal.

1:14:16.065 --> 1:14:18.534
Your money's no good
where we're goin', lad.

1:14:19.602 --> 1:14:21.470
Take 'em.

1:14:21.504 --> 1:14:23.105
All right,
fancy pants.

1:14:24.574 --> 1:14:26.008
Oh, Lord!

1:14:28.110 --> 1:14:29.879
After him, you fool.

1:14:29.912 --> 1:14:32.615
- After him!
- Hey, you!

1:14:32.648 --> 1:14:34.483
The rest of you will stay put.

1:15:06.916 --> 1:15:09.385
Remember when you hear
the bell, that's your cue.

1:15:10.019 --> 1:15:11.621
Ready?

1:15:11.654 --> 1:15:12.822
Ready.

1:15:20.630 --> 1:15:23.165
Welcome to our production of

1:15:23.199 --> 1:15:25.568
<i>Pirates of the Lost Colony.</i>

1:16:02.905 --> 1:16:04.507
Jeffrey.

1:16:04.540 --> 1:16:06.642
Josh? What's wrong?

1:16:06.676 --> 1:16:07.777
You know the old legend that

1:16:07.810 --> 1:16:09.145
Captain Kidd's
treasure was buried

1:16:09.178 --> 1:16:10.980
somewhere here
in town, right?

1:16:11.013 --> 1:16:12.048
Right.

1:16:12.081 --> 1:16:15.151
Well, we found it and some
real pirates showed up

1:16:15.184 --> 1:16:17.720
with Professor Ratliffe
and stole it.

1:16:17.753 --> 1:16:19.221
They kidnapped my friends.

1:16:20.122 --> 1:16:21.524
Where are they now?

1:16:21.557 --> 1:16:23.025
They said they were
taking the treasure

1:16:23.059 --> 1:16:26.128
onto the docks to load
it onto the <i>Pandora?</i>

1:16:26.162 --> 1:16:28.230
The <i>Pandora?</i>
That's our ship.

1:16:42.945 --> 1:16:44.046
Hi, Hobbs.

1:16:44.080 --> 1:16:45.548
Hello, Silven.
How are ya, mate?

1:16:48.651 --> 1:16:49.885
Silven.

1:16:49.919 --> 1:16:51.253
I knew you cannot be trusted.

1:16:51.287 --> 1:16:52.888
That's the golden rule, mate.

1:16:52.922 --> 1:16:54.523
He who's got the gold, rules.

1:16:55.891 --> 1:16:57.693
You were to get your
share of the loot, mate.

1:16:57.727 --> 1:16:59.795
Got a better offer, mate.

1:17:05.234 --> 1:17:06.969
Ooh!

1:17:08.637 --> 1:17:10.673
Besides, the Professor
is the only one

1:17:10.706 --> 1:17:12.608
who knows how to get
us back to our time.

1:17:12.641 --> 1:17:13.676
Sorry.

1:17:21.784 --> 1:17:22.818
Oh.

1:17:31.660 --> 1:17:32.928
Come on.

1:17:32.962 --> 1:17:34.163
To the ship!

1:17:39.135 --> 1:17:40.269
Wait.

1:18:04.627 --> 1:18:06.595
Watch your step, you fool.

1:18:06.629 --> 1:18:09.298
Get that treasure aboard
and be quick about it.

1:18:18.674 --> 1:18:20.276
What's the plan?

1:18:20.309 --> 1:18:22.311
We'll take care of this lot
and find your friends.

1:18:23.245 --> 1:18:24.680
You wait here.

1:18:24.713 --> 1:18:25.614
Got it.

1:18:31.353 --> 1:18:32.354
Where's Mountjoy?

1:18:32.389 --> 1:18:34.623
Oh, down yonder
with the golden-haired...

1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:19.735
Hello, Hobbs.

1:19:19.768 --> 1:19:21.203
Well, hello, lads.

1:19:21.237 --> 1:19:23.706
- Catch you at a bad time?
- A wee bit, yeah.

1:19:23.739 --> 1:19:25.341
What's in the box, Hobbs?

1:19:25.374 --> 1:19:26.775
The box, eh?

1:19:26.809 --> 1:19:30.112
Oh, well uh, let's take
a look see shall we?

1:19:58.807 --> 1:20:00.843
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

1:20:00.876 --> 1:20:01.944
Hey.

1:20:03.279 --> 1:20:04.980
Where were you?

1:20:10.119 --> 1:20:11.388
No reception.

1:20:13.423 --> 1:20:15.724
I had this
whole thing under control.

1:20:15.758 --> 1:20:18.294
Hey, guys, I know we
had our differences, but,

1:20:18.327 --> 1:20:19.962
now that we're on
the same team...

1:20:19.995 --> 1:20:21.130
What?

1:20:21.830 --> 1:20:22.765
I say leave him.

1:20:22.798 --> 1:20:24.501
He and his dad were
behind this whole thing,

1:20:24.534 --> 1:20:29.004
even the burglaries of our
town artifacts, weren't you?

1:20:29.038 --> 1:20:32.107
Yes, but I didn't
want to hurt anyone.

1:20:32.141 --> 1:20:34.843
You know my dad.
It was just business.

1:20:34.877 --> 1:20:36.145
I say leave him.

1:20:37.379 --> 1:20:39.315
Right. Let's get outta here.

1:20:40.049 --> 1:20:41.217
Wait!

1:20:42.385 --> 1:20:43.453
What?

1:20:45.988 --> 1:20:48.391
I'm sorry for being
such a jerk to you guys.

1:20:51.961 --> 1:20:54.431
Okay, Byron,
you can come with us,

1:20:55.398 --> 1:20:56.966
but it's going to cost you.

1:21:05.542 --> 1:21:08.777
I hope your affairs
are in order, Mr. Pistol,

1:21:08.811 --> 1:21:10.379
for you shan't see tomorrow.

1:21:16.553 --> 1:21:18.821
Any port in a storm,
eh, Mr. Pistol?

1:21:19.922 --> 1:21:21.123
Whoa.

1:21:21.156 --> 1:21:22.291
Whoa.

1:22:04.601 --> 1:22:06.469
You guys go.
I'll be right there.

1:22:07.404 --> 1:22:09.204
Well done, Mr. Pistol.

1:22:09.238 --> 1:22:10.607
Shall we play on?

1:22:26.221 --> 1:22:27.956
Ay, ay, ay.

1:22:34.330 --> 1:22:35.398
I'm inclined to believe

1:22:35.432 --> 1:22:37.366
you're without a weapon,
Mr. Pistol.

1:22:39.902 --> 1:22:41.036
Cheers.

1:22:44.607 --> 1:22:47.343
Never were much a swordsman,
were you, Mr. Pistol?

1:22:47.376 --> 1:22:48.611
Not really.

1:23:35.458 --> 1:23:36.925
Isn't this exciting?

1:23:36.959 --> 1:23:38.595
Arr!

1:23:46.235 --> 1:23:49.439
I've my own
time machine now, Pistol!

1:23:53.075 --> 1:23:55.545
Aye, Pistol,
I'm coming for you.

1:23:56.746 --> 1:23:58.648
The devil's upon us now.

1:24:12.161 --> 1:24:13.996
Oh, whoa!

1:24:14.029 --> 1:24:15.665
We're under fire!

1:24:15.698 --> 1:24:18.000
Oh!

1:24:22.439 --> 1:24:24.206
Roman candles?

1:24:24.239 --> 1:24:26.975
I love Roman candles.

1:24:27.510 --> 1:24:29.211
Coming from the pier!

1:24:29.244 --> 1:24:31.681
Aye! Train your
guns on the pier!

1:24:40.757 --> 1:24:42.324
Oh, diddly poop.

1:24:46.429 --> 1:24:48.665
Prepare, prepare for battle.

1:24:48.698 --> 1:24:50.400
Fire!

1:25:21.564 --> 1:25:23.433
Coming about now!

1:25:23.466 --> 1:25:24.667
Coming about!

1:25:28.471 --> 1:25:31.106
Dying's the easy part,
Mr. Pistol.

1:25:31.139 --> 1:25:32.374
It's the livin' what's hard.

1:25:44.754 --> 1:25:45.822
Help!

1:25:45.855 --> 1:25:47.457
Help, help!

1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:12.448
Fire!

1:26:15.385 --> 1:26:16.619
Hold on, lads!

1:26:21.290 --> 1:26:23.459
Ooh, ooh, what's this,
what's this?

1:26:28.665 --> 1:26:30.065
Oh!

1:26:33.469 --> 1:26:34.571
Dad, help!

1:26:34.604 --> 1:26:36.773
These kids tried to kidnap me.

1:26:36.806 --> 1:26:38.408
Brig, what's going on here?

1:26:38.441 --> 1:26:39.776
Dad, did you read my message?

1:26:40.777 --> 1:26:42.144
No.

1:26:44.379 --> 1:26:46.114
<i>He and his dad
were behind this whole thing,</i>

1:26:46.148 --> 1:26:49.519
<i>even the burglaries of our
town's artifacts, weren't you?</i>

1:26:49.552 --> 1:26:51.554
<i>Yes, but,
you know my dad.</i>

1:26:51.588 --> 1:26:53.723
<i>It was just business.</i>

1:26:53.756 --> 1:26:57.393
Mr. Mayor, I think we
need to have a conversation.

1:26:59.227 --> 1:27:00.362
Let's talk.

1:27:22.184 --> 1:27:23.486
Dad?

1:27:23.519 --> 1:27:24.821
Yes.

1:27:25.555 --> 1:27:26.789
It's me, Josh.

1:27:31.728 --> 1:27:33.563
How did you come back?

1:27:36.799 --> 1:27:38.333
Love.

1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:46.341
It's Dad.

1:27:49.646 --> 1:27:51.246
I knew it.

1:27:51.279 --> 1:27:52.615
I knew you'd come back.

1:28:04.259 --> 1:28:05.260
Josh!

1:28:05.895 --> 1:28:07.897
Mr. Dare, it's really you!

1:28:07.930 --> 1:28:09.599
It's really me.

1:28:09.632 --> 1:28:11.634
You see, Chip,
this is the anomaly,

1:28:11.668 --> 1:28:14.302
the unexpected event that
happens and it defies all odds.

1:28:14.336 --> 1:28:15.772
I can't believe it.

1:28:15.805 --> 1:28:17.407
Hey!

1:28:22.679 --> 1:28:24.781
<i>I guess everyone
has a different idea</i>

1:28:24.814 --> 1:28:27.817
<i>of what the true treasure
of Pirate's Cove is.</i>

1:28:27.850 --> 1:28:32.689
<i>Some would say it's a stash
of ancient gold and jewels.</i>

1:28:32.722 --> 1:28:36.559
<i>Others would argue that true
love is the treasure they seek,</i>

1:28:37.794 --> 1:28:40.262
<i>or perhaps the mystery
of what lies</i>

1:28:40.295 --> 1:28:42.999
<i>beyond the horizon
is what drives them.</i>

1:28:43.032 --> 1:28:47.570
<i>But to me, the greatest
treasures the world has to offer</i>

1:28:47.603 --> 1:28:50.640
<i>are the friends and family
who sail with you</i>

1:28:50.673 --> 1:28:52.608
<i>on the adventure of life.</i>

1:28:56.646 --> 1:28:57.947
I can't believe
we got our hands

1:28:57.980 --> 1:29:00.450
on all that treasure
and just let it go.

1:29:00.483 --> 1:29:01.784
What about the time machine?

1:29:01.818 --> 1:29:04.654
Man, that had some
interesting possibilities.

1:29:04.687 --> 1:29:06.889
We'll just wait
'til they come back.

1:29:06.923 --> 1:29:09.892
Wait, Chip,
you are the one person

1:29:09.926 --> 1:29:11.861
that would know that
the odds of them coming back

1:29:11.894 --> 1:29:13.396
are slim and none.

1:29:13.963 --> 1:29:15.665
What if someone altered

1:29:15.698 --> 1:29:18.034
the date coordinates
of the time machine?

1:29:18.067 --> 1:29:19.502
You didn't.

1:29:20.036 --> 1:29:21.303
Yeppers.

1:29:21.336 --> 1:29:22.839
What date did you enter?

1:29:22.872 --> 1:29:24.440
Next Tuesday.

1:29:25.708 --> 1:29:26.776
You did what?
