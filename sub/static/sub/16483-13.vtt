00:01.293 --> 00:03.295
<i>Previously on</i> Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.462 --> 00:04.964
This is what gave you your super-strength?

00:05.172 --> 00:07.049
We used a modified version of that formula

00:07.133 --> 00:08.884
you confiscated
from Agent Johnson's father.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.178
S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't going away.
We need to strike back.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.222
- I can assemble a team.
- That won't be necessary.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.558
I think it's time the Superior sends
some men of his own.

00:15.766 --> 00:18.936
Anton Ivanov, a reclusive industrialist
with a submarine.

00:19.145 --> 00:20.938
<i>- Bingo.</i>
- You said you wanted to destroy

00:21.022 --> 00:24.608
the Inhumans and the thing
that brought them upon us. What is it?

00:24.942 --> 00:27.111
A man,
you can help me get to him?

00:27.445 --> 00:30.614
You're not May. He switched you,
didn't he? Where's the real May?

00:31.032 --> 00:31.991
How's our guest?

00:32.073 --> 00:34.452
She's been a model patient,
even with the move.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.704
We'll find her. I promise.

00:49.967 --> 00:50.968
I'd be the first to admit

00:51.052 --> 00:52.762
that I've followed
my worst instincts at times.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.639
Last year. Loss will make you do that.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.809
It feels good in the moment, <i>gracias.</i>

00:59.351 --> 01:00.770
But it never ends well.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.229
I've lost my temper.

01:02.772 --> 01:03.689
I've killed.

01:05.816 --> 01:06.901
But lately...

01:08.027 --> 01:11.363
I have this voice in my head telling me
not to go down that path again.

01:12.198 --> 01:13.574
It's telling me to be patient...

01:14.408 --> 01:15.534
to stay steady.

01:16.619 --> 01:17.995
<i>I take it you don't mean me, sir.</i>

01:19.163 --> 01:20.372
It's Agent May.

01:21.332 --> 01:22.708
She'd tell me to stay on mission.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.127
<i>Listen to the woman.
She knows what she's talking about.</i>

01:25.836 --> 01:27.505
Hold on. This could be her.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.803
<i>Careful.
This woman disappeared from her old life.</i>

01:34.303 --> 01:36.222
We don't know if we can trust her,
but she could be...

01:36.472 --> 01:39.016
I know.
She could lead us to May.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.020
Damn it. I don't have confirmation.

01:43.312 --> 01:44.980
Her face will be
all the confirmation we need.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.817
<i>Buenos dias,</i> Roberto.
I'll have the usual, please.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.401
Ready to go, Agnes.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.613
- How is your day?
- Good day so far, thanks.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.578
I'd say that's confirmation.

02:12.883 --> 02:13.801
My God...

02:14.301 --> 02:15.177
Aida...

02:15.719 --> 02:16.929
it's astonishing.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.474
Agent May kept finding
the edges of our simulations.

02:20.724 --> 02:23.435
That's no longer a concern,
given the Earth has no edges.

02:23.978 --> 02:24.895
It's round.

02:25.271 --> 02:28.232
I understood that conceptually,
we were building a world, but I...

02:28.524 --> 02:30.568
I didn't expect you would build
our entire world.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.153
With slight improvements.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.406
And Agent May, she's...

02:36.073 --> 02:36.949
happy?

02:37.199 --> 02:40.161
The clinical definition of happy
is difficult to quantify.

02:40.995 --> 02:44.123
- But she meets much of the criteria.
- Well then, that's a yes.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.502
Whatever price we needed
to pay for the Darkhold...

02:50.337 --> 02:51.672
it was worth it.

02:56.969 --> 03:00.431
- Welcome, welcome. Morning check-up?
- It's midnight.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.976
Does that thing have to be in here?

03:04.852 --> 03:05.978
Of course not.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.277
Well, this place is perfect.
All the power we need.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.655
- And undetectable?
- I believe so.

03:17.573 --> 03:18.866
I've lived here for many years.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.951
Great! But that... that book...
you really shouldn't...

03:21.660 --> 03:24.121
touch that. It's...
It's dangerous, powerful.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.456
I'm aware.

03:26.123 --> 03:29.001
- I read it while you were sleeping.
- You did what?

03:29.251 --> 03:32.004
I specifically said it was mine
to examine, decipher...

03:32.171 --> 03:34.673
You said it would help me find
a solution.

03:34.924 --> 03:38.427
- To eliminate the Inhuman problem.
- And I also said, "Don't touch it!"

03:38.969 --> 03:43.057
- Could warp the senses, corrupt the mind.
- Relax. I glanced at it...

03:43.807 --> 03:45.059
and it gave me a simple answer.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.145
You.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.524
Why do you think you're still alive?

03:53.317 --> 03:55.361
As we discussed when you first arrived...

03:56.403 --> 03:57.613
we have plans...

03:58.697 --> 04:00.324
- for a future together.
- Yes.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.701
I've already worked out the first step.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.412
You found an Inhuman to dangle
in front of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

04:05.788 --> 04:07.039
Well, no. Because...

04:07.748 --> 04:10.751
as you're aware,
they are not easy to come by.

04:13.504 --> 04:14.588
Until now.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.348
Pure Terrigen crystals.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.226
I picked up some samples last year
when I was working for a...

04:28.227 --> 04:29.687
previous benefactor.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.481
His goals were...
Well, the complete opposite of yours,

04:32.648 --> 04:33.649
so I've been, uh...

04:34.149 --> 04:36.068
working to refine the compound, grow it...

04:37.319 --> 04:40.030
- Superior.
- The... the chemical in this pure form

04:40.197 --> 04:42.116
is harmless to humans.

04:42.366 --> 04:45.286
If you're a potential Inhuman,
however...

04:46.662 --> 04:48.038
it will turn you.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.499
We're counting on it.

04:53.544 --> 04:55.337
Oh, for the love of...

04:56.171 --> 04:58.257
What now? Oh, that's for me.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.510
Dial in that scanner.
We can't have it detecting

05:01.677 --> 05:03.512
every metal clothes hanger
as an LMD.

05:03.721 --> 05:05.681
Coulson's got a prosthetic hand,
for God sakes.

05:06.432 --> 05:07.599
Yes, sir.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.728
That's enough for now.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.733
Agent Simmons?

05:17.359 --> 05:18.944
It's not good news, I'm afraid.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.613
The serum that's been giving you
your strength...

05:22.865 --> 05:23.949
it...

05:24.241 --> 05:25.200
is...

05:25.743 --> 05:26.910
potentially lethal.

05:28.704 --> 05:29.788
So, you're saying it's...

05:30.122 --> 05:31.248
a little risky?

05:32.082 --> 05:34.084
I'm saying it's Russian roulette.

05:34.585 --> 05:37.212
You've been fortunate so far,
but the next injection...

05:38.005 --> 05:40.382
might cause cardiac arrest.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.426
And if it doesn't...

05:42.843 --> 05:47.514
the one after is even more likely
to kill you and so on, and so on, until...

05:47.806 --> 05:49.892
Geez. Don't sugar-coat it, Doc.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.271
And by that, I mean, please,
go ahead and sugar-coat it.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.440
I'm sorry.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.568
I know General Talbot was hoping
to replicate

05:59.735 --> 06:01.028
what was done to Steve Rogers, but...

06:01.779 --> 06:03.697
...but you'll never be Captain America.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.950
But, you know,
I agreed not to take the serum

06:07.117 --> 06:10.245
until you completed the medical tests.
I'm even in daily physical conditioning,

06:10.412 --> 06:13.082
- learning to fight.
- Yeah, and I hear you're doing well.

06:13.290 --> 06:16.460
Agent Piper had me pinned
in ten seconds this morning.

06:18.712 --> 06:22.007
- Tomorrow, it will be 12.
- No, no, you don't understand.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.635
I need my strength.
We're already a man down.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.763
Look, we are all doing everything
to find Agent May.

06:28.263 --> 06:29.306
I know.

06:29.598 --> 06:33.352
And I'm a team player. I'm willing to play
any position that gets us the win.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.813
But I already went from head coach
to quarterback

06:35.896 --> 06:38.357
and now you're telling me I'm gonna be
on the bench for the season?

06:40.234 --> 06:41.360
Sir...

06:41.985 --> 06:46.698
I have no doubt you will find your place
on the footie squad.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.369
Ladies and gentlemen,
straight from engineering

06:50.536 --> 06:52.955
and complete with all the modifications
that you requested.

06:53.455 --> 06:56.208
Director Mace, say goodbye
to your briefcase, because...

06:58.335 --> 07:01.547
you now have a serum-delivery device
on the belt of your suit.

07:01.839 --> 07:04.758
Just one turn, and the injection
is delivered directly into the...

07:06.385 --> 07:08.053
Tests... The tests didn't go that well,
did they?

07:08.303 --> 07:09.471
Okay. Well, in that case,

07:09.680 --> 07:12.057
it's also good that we added
a heart monitor and a GPS,

07:12.307 --> 07:13.767
- so when you do use the injection...
- Fitz!

07:14.893 --> 07:17.229
He can't. It's too dangerous.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.106
Oh.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.152
You could... could've told me that
before I did my whole big presentation...

07:23.235 --> 07:25.988
- Director, we got to keep you on schedule.
- Oh, thank God.

07:32.327 --> 07:35.497
If our friends
in Calgary could take asset 63-D94A,

07:35.622 --> 07:37.583
that would be better.
She's gonna need a cold climate.

07:38.333 --> 07:41.295
And remember, the relocation data
is for S.H.I.E.L.D.'s eyes only,

07:41.462 --> 07:43.630
so if you get any pushback,
you know how to find me.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.591
<i>Copy that, Agent Johnson.</i>

07:46.300 --> 07:47.468
Inhuman relocation?

07:47.926 --> 07:49.803
The people who want to kill them
have the Darkhold.

07:50.012 --> 07:52.473
We have to assume that every Inhuman
is a potential target.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.392
Senator Nadeer is gonna fight us on this.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.270
The Sokovia Accords give her
a right to their locations.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.772
That's why you'll make sure
the UN backs our play,

08:00.939 --> 08:03.484
no matter how many gruelling
bureaucratic conference calls...

08:03.984 --> 08:05.235
you have to make.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.450
Phil, how's the fishing expedition?

08:12.201 --> 08:13.285
Turns out Fitz was right.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.787
Radcliffe didn't create Aida
out of thin air.

08:16.455 --> 08:17.831
He modelled her after someone.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.375
A woman named Agnes Kitsworth.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.003
Australian expat living in Spain.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.672
<i>We've been surveilling her,
but she seems uncompromised.</i>

08:25.839 --> 08:27.758
Well, let's hope she can lead us
to Agent May.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.010
So, how can I help?

08:30.719 --> 08:31.762
<i>You're doing it.</i>

08:32.429 --> 08:34.389
Mm. I want to be here for you, Phil.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.851
Radcliffe has the Darkhold,
May is missing,

08:38.184 --> 08:40.354
Nadeer and her Russians
are gunning for the Inhumans.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.231
I need to do something more.

08:42.731 --> 08:45.776
<i>I know. I felt the same way
when I started working with the Avengers.</i>

08:46.485 --> 08:49.863
<i>It's not easy to find your place
when you're working with heroes and gods.</i>

08:51.281 --> 08:52.366
So, what did you do?

08:53.951 --> 08:55.619
I did my best to protect the team.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.454
Turns out I had a role to play.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.873
You'll make the right decision
at the right time.

09:00.499 --> 09:02.668
Or you'll get an Asgardian staff
through the chest.

09:02.918 --> 09:03.877
I'd try to avoid that part.

09:04.336 --> 09:05.420
Goes without saying.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.214
Thanks, Phil.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.434
It's a replica, you know.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.603
The original's in Majorca.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.730
Yeah, I know.

09:24.106 --> 09:27.025
You know because you've spent time
in Majorca...

09:27.985 --> 09:30.112
or because you know
a thing or two about replicas?

09:32.573 --> 09:33.949
I'm sorry. Have we met?

09:34.658 --> 09:35.701
Not yet.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.786
But I know about the work you did
with Holden Radcliffe.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.293
Our work?

09:48.672 --> 09:50.757
- You don't know anything.
- Then help me to understand.

09:51.675 --> 09:55.721
Okay. I don't want anything to do
with that man ever again. Understand?

09:56.638 --> 09:58.724
- Now leave me alone.
- We're with S.H.I.E.L.D.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.100
We need to talk.

10:01.893 --> 10:02.978
Show her.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.487
Oh, my God.

10:13.822 --> 10:14.865
He actually did it.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.456
If the UN want to play hardball,
then we'll throw harder.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.416
I want the public up in arms
about S.H.I.E.L.D.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.210
hiding Inhumans in their backyards
and I want it by the evening news.

10:27.377 --> 10:30.172
- I'll call a press conference.
- And book me some follow-up appearances

10:30.255 --> 10:32.841
on talk radio.
You know which networks and...

10:36.470 --> 10:37.596
What are you doing here?

10:38.722 --> 10:39.765
I need a word.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.227
You're comfortable with them hearing this?

10:44.561 --> 10:46.063
I have no secrets from my staff.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.399
Mm.

10:50.067 --> 10:52.027
We've been discussing your role in this.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.405
You've been very impressive
on the front lines,

10:55.947 --> 10:58.867
proven over and over again
your commitment to this cause.

10:59.201 --> 11:01.036
Thank you. I've made some sacrifices, yes.

11:01.370 --> 11:04.081
I saw it myself.
And I've wondered...

11:04.414 --> 11:07.793
which was worse.
Realising your brother was infected

11:08.210 --> 11:10.462
and had to die because of it,
or realising...

11:11.546 --> 11:14.549
you have the same blood coursing
through your veins?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.885
I don't appreciate your implication.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.762
I'm not that alien filth.

11:19.262 --> 11:20.347
Not now.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.808
Maybe not ever.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.643
But that...

11:25.477 --> 11:27.312
gene passes on and on.

11:27.979 --> 11:28.980
And on.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.567
Maybe even skips a generation,
maybe not.

11:34.486 --> 11:37.906
But everyone that carries it
is part of the plague.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.534
How dare you? I want you out of my office.

11:40.784 --> 11:43.829
Superior knows it's not your fault.
That you'll play a role in this.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.083
No, wait. No. Stop. Wait.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.468
I'm okay. I'm...

12:00.929 --> 12:01.972
No.

12:02.806 --> 12:03.807
No!

12:07.686 --> 12:10.105
No!

12:12.232 --> 12:14.609
You thought it was me?

12:15.777 --> 12:16.737
Look at you.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.364
You're disgusting, you son of a...

12:27.497 --> 12:31.084
<i>Details are scarce, but it appears
that Senator Ellen Nadeer's office</i>

12:31.251 --> 12:34.755
<i>was ground zero in an explosion
that looks deliberately set.</i>

12:35.088 --> 12:39.801
<i>Many are asking if Nadeer's outspoken
anti-Inhuman stance made her a target.</i>

12:40.093 --> 12:42.429
<i>Currently, there are no suspects,
but the FBI is...</i>

12:42.596 --> 12:44.514
Is it possible?
Could an Inhuman have done this?

12:44.848 --> 12:47.142
No way. They've all been accounted
for by me.

12:47.642 --> 12:48.769
We can't account for the Inhumans

12:48.935 --> 12:50.937
that we don't know about
or the sympathisers.

12:51.313 --> 12:52.939
Come on, you guys.
This is just another setup.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.900
Nadeer's furious about the relocations

12:55.066 --> 12:56.735
and she wants people
riled up against Inhumans.

12:56.902 --> 12:59.362
Would Nadeer go so far
as to bomb her own office?

12:59.654 --> 13:02.783
Trust me, she's gonna show up on the news
having just missed the blast,

13:02.949 --> 13:04.159
and she's gonna pin it all on S.H.I.E.L.D.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.118
- That's what she does.
- Daisy.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.788
<i>We're just getting confirmation
from the FBI.</i>

13:07.913 --> 13:12.542
<i>We have four confirmed casualties
and one positive identification.</i>

13:12.959 --> 13:15.545
<i>We are sad to confirm
that Senator Ellen Nadeer,</i>

13:15.754 --> 13:18.924
<i>leader in the Humans First movement,
is among the dead.</i>

13:19.299 --> 13:21.468
<i>Reporting live for CNB,
we'll send it back to you in the studio.</i>

13:21.760 --> 13:22.844
Okay.

13:23.345 --> 13:26.389
Well, we can't be too sad.
She did try to have you killed.

13:27.390 --> 13:30.352
She could've been brought to justice.
Now we won't get that chance.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.230
But it's not too late to do
the right thing.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.357
Grab what you need.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.734
It's time to show the world
what S.H.I.E.L.D. stands for.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.654
So, I'll mark you down
as shocked but not surprised,

13:40.862 --> 13:41.863
which is surprising.

13:42.364 --> 13:46.618
Well, Holden's whole post-human work
started with replacing body parts, so...

13:48.286 --> 13:49.412
Why not go for the whole shebang?

13:49.579 --> 13:52.332
I can think of about a million reasons
why not, but Radcliffe did it anyway.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.626
He called her Aida.

13:55.085 --> 13:58.004
And he could have made her look
like anyone, but he chose you.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.090
Yeah, I got that part. Thanks.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.092
You said you didn't work together.

14:02.634 --> 14:03.885
Were you special to him?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.222
I thought so.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.184
But what I really was to him
was the one thing he couldn't quite fix.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.061
No matter what he tried...

14:13.603 --> 14:14.771
he always hit a brick wall.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.316
How we felt about each other
didn't matter. What mattered...

14:19.651 --> 14:21.278
was that he couldn't deal with failure.

14:22.904 --> 14:23.989
So, he left me.

14:25.657 --> 14:26.783
Ran, really.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.119
What is it?

14:32.289 --> 14:33.707
Glioblastoma multiforme.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.878
I know, it's boring. Just your...

14:38.253 --> 14:39.880
garden variety brain tumour.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.716
But at least
it's in a really interesting place,

14:42.883 --> 14:44.926
which makes it totally inoperable.

14:46.636 --> 14:47.554
I'm sorry.

14:50.015 --> 14:51.224
See, that's why I'm here.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.728
So, I don't have to hear that every day.

14:57.731 --> 15:01.443
Anyway, thanks for ruining
one of the few good days I have left.

15:02.277 --> 15:05.155
Finding out your nightmare ex
has built a robot replacement of you

15:05.322 --> 15:06.781
is a lot to process, so...

15:08.158 --> 15:10.827
- I'd appreciate it if you let me go.
- I can't let you do that.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.078
Coulson...

15:12.871 --> 15:14.164
We need to find Radcliffe...

15:15.290 --> 15:16.708
- and you're gonna help us.
- No, I'm not.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.377
I'm living out the rest of my life
on my terms

15:19.502 --> 15:20.962
and that means having...

15:21.171 --> 15:25.550
- ...nothing to do with Holden Radcliffe.
- I understand your situation...

15:26.092 --> 15:28.178
and I don't want to make you cooperate,
but if I have to...

15:28.303 --> 15:30.847
I wake up and face death every day.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.099
You think I'm scared of you?

15:36.519 --> 15:38.980
I don't know what you hope to accomplish
by waltzing in here

15:39.147 --> 15:40.690
with that logo on your jackets,

15:41.566 --> 15:45.153
- but it's bad for all of us.
- Director Mace, are Inhumans behind this?

15:52.744 --> 15:54.996
You said you wanted to show the world
what S.H.I.E.L.D. stands for.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.541
Well, I was hoping to do that by solving
this thing.

15:58.833 --> 15:59.960
We got this.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.255
So, I guess now I'm the team mascot.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.094
We've got an address.

16:09.552 --> 16:10.595
I'm bringing her into custody.

16:13.098 --> 16:14.224
Then you'll be doing it alone.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.142
Agnes gets us to Radcliffe.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.436
- Radcliffe gets us to May...
- She said she couldn't help us.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.855
She said she wouldn't.
There's a difference.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.899
This is a woman's life.
The end of her life.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.859
Just give her some peace.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.570
- This is May we're talking about.
- Yes, May.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.532
The voice in your head telling you
not to be reckless this time.

16:31.116 --> 16:33.451
I'm not planning on punching a hole
in the universe

16:33.660 --> 16:37.956
- and releasing a demon into the world.
- Well, for Agnes, Radcliffe is the demon.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.001
Even if she agrees to reach out to him,
we don't know if Radcliffe has May.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.502
We don't even know if May is still...

16:44.045 --> 16:45.046
Go ahead.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.631
Finish that thought.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.634
Look, I know how hard it is to let go
of someone you love.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.346
But there's gonna come a time
when you have to realise...

16:53.596 --> 16:54.931
I'm not giving up on May.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.308
When I was gone,
she never gave up on me.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.811
So, I'm gonna make Agnes cooperate.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.855
You don't need to be part of it.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.198
How am I not finding any trace
of bomb-making material?

17:12.615 --> 17:15.577
You know, the same way I'm not finding
any trace of accelerant.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.538
- Has to be something.
- Clearly.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.498
And yet, there is nothing.

17:21.583 --> 17:22.625
So...

17:22.791 --> 17:25.211
we take a bit of everything
and test a bit of everything, old-school.

17:25.587 --> 17:27.756
Like in the chem lab, at our old school.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.426
Guess who was seen entering
Nadeer's office right before the blast?

17:32.719 --> 17:33.970
Cattle-prod enthusiast...

17:34.721 --> 17:35.764
Tucker Shockley.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.849
He was with the Russians
who took the Darkhold.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.517
And if memory serves...

17:40.018 --> 17:41.019
I quaked his ass.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.730
Senator Nadeer was also aligned
with the Russians.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.524
- Why would they want her dead?
- Villain-on-villain violence?

17:46.775 --> 17:48.485
If the Russians and Radcliffe
have the Darkhold,

17:48.610 --> 17:51.112
they could have created a new,
untraceable explosive.

17:51.279 --> 17:52.405
I really hate that book.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.991
However, they did this,
if Shockley's not one of the three bodies

17:55.158 --> 17:57.494
in the morgue right now, he's our bomber.
We need to find him.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.329
How does a facial-recognition search
in the city

17:59.496 --> 18:01.539
with the most surveillance cameras
on the planet sound?

18:01.915 --> 18:03.083
Like a good start.

18:22.143 --> 18:23.895
Thought you didn't make it.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.355
No.

18:25.563 --> 18:26.648
Almost didn't.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.692
I...

18:31.611 --> 18:33.905
I told you to bring her to me
if she didn't turn,

18:34.239 --> 18:36.449
not to set off a bomb
and blow her to pieces.

18:36.866 --> 18:40.411
I released the Terrigen, like we planned.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.539
She turned.

18:43.331 --> 18:47.669
She became a husk, a thing that exploded.

18:48.128 --> 18:51.464
Maybe the doc's Terrigen was bad.
I don't know.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.801
- How did you get out?
- I don't remember.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.846
Give me a chance
to prove myself.

18:58.179 --> 19:01.015
- I know...
- How am I supposed to trust you?

19:02.517 --> 19:03.518
You...

19:04.185 --> 19:05.228
are my...

19:05.979 --> 19:07.522
Superior.

19:09.190 --> 19:10.233
Hmm.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.449
That's all I wanted to hear.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.586
I leave the city now.

19:30.461 --> 19:33.214
You've made it far too great a risk
to even be in this country.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.260
We both know S.H.I.E.L.D.
will come for you,

19:37.927 --> 19:39.304
and try to take you down.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.348
And I will take them down with me.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.068
If you have to shoot, be precise.

19:54.235 --> 19:56.029
We don't even know what these explosives
look like.

19:56.237 --> 19:57.322
Got it.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.829
- Go, go!
- Don't move! Get down!

20:11.961 --> 20:13.004
Hi.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.758
I was planning on coming down here,

20:17.467 --> 20:20.053
try to throw my weight around,
force you to comply.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.347
I came up
with some pretty good material,

20:22.764 --> 20:25.683
but I think the best place
to start might be an apology.

20:26.643 --> 20:30.230
I know you don't want to hear
"I'm sorry" anymore, so I apologise.

20:31.481 --> 20:32.523
Really...

20:32.941 --> 20:33.983
I do.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.443
Okay.

20:36.194 --> 20:37.820
Radcliffe took something from me, too.

20:38.196 --> 20:39.656
Her name is Melinda May.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.908
And she means everything
to me.

20:52.502 --> 20:53.795
I wish there was another way.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.506
I'm trying
not to make it personal because...

20:57.465 --> 20:59.008
May would hate that, but...

21:00.426 --> 21:01.636
I can't help it.

21:02.845 --> 21:03.930
It is.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.308
What do you mean he took her?

21:08.309 --> 21:09.435
He kidnapped her.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.479
And then he replaced her.

21:12.313 --> 21:13.648
For weeks, we lived...

21:14.190 --> 21:16.484
with an android impostor right next to us.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.195
I drank with her, chatting it up.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.365
She was spying on us
on Radcliffe's behalf.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.410
Once we figured out what he'd done,
he was gone.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.078
And I still don't know...

21:27.996 --> 21:30.540
what happened to May
or if she's even still...

21:32.166 --> 21:34.669
Look, obviously, I'm not his biggest fan,

21:34.877 --> 21:37.547
but I can't believe Holden
would do something like that.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.090
He's all about...

21:39.465 --> 21:42.093
healing, enhancing, prolonging life.

21:42.427 --> 21:43.678
It's a lot to explain...

21:44.554 --> 21:47.765
but Dr Radcliffe is under the influence
of something dark and powerful.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.600
He is not the same man you knew.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.070
May's like you.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.323
She's brave...

22:03.656 --> 22:04.741
and she's not afraid of death.

22:05.158 --> 22:08.578
But she deserves the chance to live
what's left of her life on her own terms.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.330
I know you can appreciate that.

22:18.921 --> 22:20.214
What do you need me to do?

22:30.224 --> 22:31.893
Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.356
Hello, sweetheart.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.108
You're lucky you're with us
and not the FBI.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.487
We have you on tape walking
into the senator's office

22:42.695 --> 22:44.322
moments before the blast.

22:45.365 --> 22:48.659
What do you care?
That woman hated things like you.

22:51.746 --> 22:53.664
Were you following the Russians' orders?

22:54.832 --> 22:56.459
We know about Anton Ivanov.

22:56.876 --> 23:00.838
- Why'd he target Nadeer?
- Is the Director here?

23:01.964 --> 23:03.716
Did Radcliffe make the bomb?

23:04.759 --> 23:06.010
You see, I'm trying to help you.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.763
If you get us to Radcliffe,
I can get you a deal.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.307
The only freak...

23:12.141 --> 23:13.518
I'll speak to is the Director.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.271
Okay.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.984
Let's try again now, shall we?

23:23.569 --> 23:26.447
Where is Radcliffe?

23:30.034 --> 23:31.035
Aida...

23:31.911 --> 23:34.414
would you do something
about that infernal buzzing?

23:35.748 --> 23:38.042
Sir, it says you've received
an urgent alert

23:38.167 --> 23:40.253
from a post-humanist sub-group?

23:41.254 --> 23:42.380
Marked private.

23:43.589 --> 23:44.882
No, it can't be.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.726
No. This is...

23:56.602 --> 23:57.895
Is this fate?

24:00.148 --> 24:01.482
I need to leave immediately.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.736
You must perfect the Framework
in my absence. It's imperative.

24:06.112 --> 24:09.115
Doctor, you designed me
to read social cues.

24:09.323 --> 24:11.742
You're being evasive.

24:12.994 --> 24:14.287
How to explain...

24:14.829 --> 24:19.625
Any robotic humanoid must avoid
the appearance of being almost human.

24:19.917 --> 24:23.754
Even the slightest appearance
of inauthenticity...

24:24.589 --> 24:27.758
- elicits a sense of revulsion.
- You mean avoiding the uncanny valley?

24:27.925 --> 24:29.218
Exactly. But...

24:30.428 --> 24:32.972
...you don't look at all uncanny.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.557
In fact...

24:35.057 --> 24:37.727
you look entirely authentic.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.146
Familiar, even.

24:42.773 --> 24:44.025
I'm not unique?

24:45.485 --> 24:47.111
Aida, you're absolutely unique.

24:47.987 --> 24:48.905
It was just...

24:49.363 --> 24:51.699
good science to model you on someone real.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.828
Someone you were close to.

24:57.205 --> 24:58.247
Yes.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.374
Now she needs my help.

25:21.604 --> 25:24.232
Damn.
Got hydrocarbons up the wazoo,

25:24.398 --> 25:26.943
but not a single oxidising agent
that would cause an explosion.

25:27.109 --> 25:29.070
- No nitro-methane? Sulphonic acid?
- No. No,

25:29.237 --> 25:31.364
- just carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:32.573 --> 25:33.741
Did you find selenium?

25:34.325 --> 25:35.368
How did you know?

25:35.993 --> 25:38.412
Jemma, you didn't find pieces
of bomb casing in that office.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.289
- You found pieces of Inhuman husk.
- Inhuman husk!

25:40.414 --> 25:42.375
- Fitz, you're brilliant!
- Well, we both said it at the same time.

25:42.583 --> 25:45.127
So, that means that somebody in
that office went through a Terrigenesis.

25:45.336 --> 25:48.506
- And then what, just exploded?
- We've seen worse.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.675
Big question is, how did Shockley...

25:51.884 --> 25:53.553
survive it?

25:54.720 --> 25:55.888
Bloody hell.

26:00.810 --> 26:03.354
If this guy wants to talk to me,
then why not?

26:04.105 --> 26:06.649
We could try out
one of my other superpowers.

26:08.484 --> 26:09.527
Persuasion.

26:16.492 --> 26:17.493
Whoo!

26:18.160 --> 26:20.454
Quake, Director Mace.

26:20.955 --> 26:26.043
You two might be
the most famous Inhumans in the world.

26:27.128 --> 26:28.671
Forgive me, fellas.

26:31.007 --> 26:32.758
- Get away from him!
- He's the bomb!

26:33.884 --> 26:34.969
Move!

26:44.770 --> 26:45.855
- Hang on!
- Fitz!

27:10.796 --> 27:12.214
Is everybody okay?

27:16.135 --> 27:17.219
Don't do that!

27:17.803 --> 27:18.846
What, help save the day?

27:19.180 --> 27:22.266
No, do that. Just don't risk your life
when you're doing it!

27:22.433 --> 27:24.143
You could've been blown to bits.

27:57.927 --> 27:59.011
Whoo!

28:00.680 --> 28:01.764
Well...

28:02.640 --> 28:03.641
that was fun.

28:07.728 --> 28:08.771
Hey!

28:09.271 --> 28:11.023
You been in some sort of accident, mister?

28:11.607 --> 28:12.608
Uh...

28:13.150 --> 28:14.151
yeah.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.614
I'd be real grateful
if you could give me a ride.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.452
What happened to your clothes?

28:26.580 --> 28:28.874
This is why I need to be
at full strength at all times.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.042
If I'd been powered up,

28:30.209 --> 28:32.586
- none of this would've happened.
- It's okay. We got him out.

28:32.753 --> 28:34.797
I mean, it wasn't pretty, but no one died.

28:35.005 --> 28:37.133
Except for maybe Shockley,
but I'm fine with that.

28:37.299 --> 28:40.052
Agent Johnson,
I fumbled the ball.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.346
There's no excusing that.

28:46.809 --> 28:48.352
All right, pay attention.

28:55.609 --> 28:58.070
- What is that?
- It's a high-pitched frequency

28:58.195 --> 29:00.156
caused by Shockley's cellular vibration.

29:00.281 --> 29:03.284
The ramping up of his kinetic energy
at an atomic level,

29:03.617 --> 29:07.204
and once it reaches a critical threshold,
that massive energy transforms his body

29:07.371 --> 29:10.332
from a solid to a flammable gaseous state
and then...

29:10.583 --> 29:12.501
- Boom.
- Now how he re-constitutes...

29:13.544 --> 29:16.797
who knows? But, it's likely that
he's still alive somewhere.

29:16.964 --> 29:20.301
All right, so we know he can control it,
but how do we control him?

29:24.805 --> 29:25.848
What...

29:26.849 --> 29:28.934
- You guys know that I can't...
- Yeah, well, you did absorb tremors

29:29.059 --> 29:30.352
- in Los Angeles.
- Yeah.

29:30.519 --> 29:32.438
Yeah, but this would be
a counter-vibration.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.440
It's not the same thing. I can't just...

29:38.861 --> 29:40.404
- I can try.
- Excellent.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.698
Now we just need to devise
a way to contain him.

29:42.907 --> 29:45.868
However we do it, we need to do it fast.
Shockley is now the perfect weapon

29:46.076 --> 29:48.913
an undetectable suicide bomber
who gets to walk away.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.165
Just imagine the damage he could do.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.588
If he hasn't shown up by now,
he's not going to.

29:58.422 --> 30:01.926
Trust me. I know him.
He hates confrontation.

30:03.344 --> 30:04.845
We've got to give him a chance.

30:05.179 --> 30:06.263
<i>Why?</i>

30:06.430 --> 30:09.308
Okay. Don't give him a chance.
Give one to Melinda May.

30:09.725 --> 30:12.228
<i>Even though she would've
stormed off 20 minutes ago.</i>

30:15.064 --> 30:16.440
I like this woman.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.112
I'll wait a little longer.

30:23.572 --> 30:24.573
Thank you.

30:30.996 --> 30:31.997
For you.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.919
I knew Holden was too much
of a coward to show his face.

30:37.211 --> 30:39.088
Answer it. We can see and hear everything.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.048
You're not alone.

30:48.973 --> 30:50.182
<i>Agnes, please, listen...</i>

30:50.891 --> 30:51.976
Hello, Holden.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.311
This is not what I had in mind.

30:54.436 --> 30:57.064
<i>I'm sorry for all the precautions,
but I have to be careful.</i>

30:57.314 --> 30:58.399
<i>There are people after me, you see.</i>

30:58.566 --> 31:01.235
<i>I... I've made some scientific
breakthroughs as of late,</i>

31:01.402 --> 31:03.195
<i>and not everyone agrees
with my methods, so...</i>

31:03.487 --> 31:04.613
Holden, stop.

31:05.114 --> 31:07.283
I asked you to meet me
because I wanted closure,

31:07.408 --> 31:10.244
but if you don't have the guts
to face me...

31:11.996 --> 31:13.122
- I'm done.
<i>- Agnes,</i>

31:13.289 --> 31:16.375
<i>none of that matters right now.
I've done it. I can save you.</i>

31:17.710 --> 31:19.837
<i>- I've heard this before.
- This time, it's true.</i>

31:20.170 --> 31:22.631
<i>I said I would save you.
Let me keep my promise.</i>

31:22.923 --> 31:24.800
<i>Please, just follow my instructions.</i>

31:27.303 --> 31:30.472
<i>Get up from the table
and start walking. South.</i>

31:30.973 --> 31:32.808
He can see her. He's here.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.144
Agnes, do what he says.
Try to keep him on the phone.

31:52.161 --> 31:53.787
- I need your phone.
- Oh, sure.

32:08.052 --> 32:09.261
<i>Who is this?</i>

32:12.514 --> 32:14.016
I have a confession to make.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.270
You won't want to hear it any more
than I want to say it, but I have to.

32:18.395 --> 32:19.647
Mr Shockley.

32:20.564 --> 32:22.775
And how did you escape
S.H.I.E.L.D. custody?

32:22.942 --> 32:26.111
The Terrigen. It didn't turn Nadeer
into one of those monsters.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.281
It made me one. I caused the explosion.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.116
You're Inhuman.

32:31.867 --> 32:34.078
There's no confession
that can absolve you of this.

32:36.580 --> 32:37.790
I am a soldier.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.585
In a war to protect humanity.
I can still be that soldier.

32:42.753 --> 32:45.422
- You still have my attention.
<i>- The plan hasn't changed.</i>

32:46.090 --> 32:47.716
<i>I will deliver S.H.I.E.L.D. to you.</i>

32:54.014 --> 32:55.808
- Anything else I can do for you?
- Yeah.

32:57.768 --> 32:58.894
Run.

33:05.359 --> 33:07.111
Frack.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.530
Perhaps you're not finding
the right counter-vibration.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.116
- I'm trying.
- Yeah.

33:12.533 --> 33:14.952
And we'll keep trying until
you can defuse Mr Shockley.

33:16.286 --> 33:17.579
Again?

33:23.210 --> 33:27.006
- Are you kidding me?
- Scrimmage is over. It's game time.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.008
Shockley just blew up a motel.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.427
We have to assume
he's only getting started.

33:31.927 --> 33:33.846
Bomb squad's meeting us
on the ground. You ready?

33:36.640 --> 33:39.101
- Do you remember my Degas print?
<i>- Yes, of course.</i>

33:39.977 --> 33:41.395
You knew I loved that print.

33:41.895 --> 33:44.064
And told me that when I was cured,
you'd buy me the real thing.

33:44.273 --> 33:45.691
<i>I remember.</i>

33:45.774 --> 33:48.444
I want you to know the day you left me,
I threw that print in the bin.

33:48.569 --> 33:49.903
I couldn't look at it anymore.

33:50.112 --> 33:52.906
<i>Agnes, I hate myself
for disappearing on you,</i>

33:53.032 --> 33:54.616
<i>but I never gave up. I just...</i>

33:55.325 --> 33:57.244
<i>I realised I was
going about it all wrong.</i>

33:57.703 --> 33:58.787
<i>Instead of trying to cure your tumour,</i>

33:58.954 --> 34:01.040
<i>I should have been trying
to cure death itself.</i>

34:01.206 --> 34:02.583
What does that even mean?

34:03.167 --> 34:04.752
<i>Turn left here.
Go around the corner.</i>

34:12.676 --> 34:13.969
Come with me, Agnes, please.

34:14.511 --> 34:15.846
I can save you. You can live.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.516
Hang in there, Agnes!
We're on our way!

34:20.559 --> 34:21.685
And how would you cure death?

34:22.603 --> 34:25.230
- By making me into an android?
- No, I'm done with robotics.

34:25.606 --> 34:27.274
This breakthrough I've made
is way beyond that.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.485
I call it the Framework.

34:30.027 --> 34:33.864
I've built a world
where death is obsolete.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.491
You wouldn't even be
the first to experience it.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.702
I have a subject in the Framework
right now and she's thriving.

34:39.161 --> 34:41.746
I can give you a full and happy life.

34:41.871 --> 34:44.166
That's...
That's all I've ever wanted for you.

34:46.668 --> 34:48.253
Do not listen to him!
Keep him there!

34:52.841 --> 34:53.884
Radcliffe!

34:55.844 --> 34:57.054
Get us out of here. We need cover.

35:28.418 --> 35:29.753
Simmons, you copy?

35:30.671 --> 35:32.548
Copy. We're about half a mile away.

35:32.673 --> 35:34.299
<i>Okay. Well, hurry up.
'Cause if you recall,</i>

35:34.424 --> 35:35.968
<i>I haven't actually been able
to pull this off yet.</i>

35:36.343 --> 35:38.470
Why don't you come closer?

35:38.846 --> 35:40.180
You scared?

35:40.722 --> 35:42.432
Looks like Shockley's back
to his old self.

35:42.599 --> 35:43.851
<i>Really? Incredible.</i>

35:44.059 --> 35:46.103
<i>He's gone from an explosive gas
to a fully functional...</i>

35:46.270 --> 35:47.312
Jackass?

35:47.479 --> 35:49.148
<i>Just consider
the sheer amount of kinetic energy</i>

35:49.314 --> 35:53.026
required to re-form. It's remarkable.
I'm exhausted just thinking about it.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.403
Exhausted.

35:55.028 --> 35:56.446
- I can work with that.
<i>- What...</i>

35:59.783 --> 36:01.577
<i>Did you just explode
Mr Shockley?</i>

36:01.910 --> 36:03.287
Well, I thought
if I can't keep him together,

36:03.453 --> 36:04.830
I might as well blow him apart.

36:12.838 --> 36:13.881
Whoo!

36:14.840 --> 36:16.049
Can't kill me that way.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.219
If you wanted to get me naked,
all had to do was...

36:23.515 --> 36:25.434
I thought Daisy was supposed
to stop him from doing that.

36:25.601 --> 36:26.727
She's going to wear him out instead.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.062
- We need to hurry.
- I'm good to go.

36:30.939 --> 36:32.107
Shall we?

36:39.406 --> 36:40.741
Those aren't ours.

36:42.075 --> 36:44.286
- Who, then?
- The Russians.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.789
This is a trap. Shockley's the bait.

36:50.042 --> 36:51.293
They're here for us.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.714
See?

36:56.089 --> 36:58.592
It's pointless! I've already won!

36:59.384 --> 37:01.970
I don't have to kill you,
just deliver you!

37:02.638 --> 37:04.181
You and your stupid...

37:10.854 --> 37:13.732
Simmons, I can't take this much longer.

37:14.483 --> 37:16.568
Sir, there's an army coming our way.
Get in the car.

37:16.944 --> 37:17.945
No.

37:19.279 --> 37:21.073
I think I figured out my place
on the team.

37:21.657 --> 37:22.866
I'm the blocker.

37:24.993 --> 37:25.911
Go.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.220
I see that you are strong.

38:31.893 --> 38:33.020
But are you bulletproof?

38:37.232 --> 38:39.401
Let those animals destroy each other.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.864
We have the Inhuman
Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

38:55.709 --> 38:57.669
Your friends aren't coming
to help you.

38:58.879 --> 39:00.881
You're just another freak like me now.

39:01.465 --> 39:02.549
Give up.

39:03.425 --> 39:04.593
I would rather...

39:05.177 --> 39:06.762
blow us all to hell.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.078
Just one last step.

39:31.286 --> 39:33.205
You're doing well.

39:36.291 --> 39:39.669
See? Painless. Just as I promised.

39:40.504 --> 39:41.671
The worst is over.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.216
No one should have to go through
what you have.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.385
Soon, you'll never suffer again.

39:47.469 --> 39:48.512
Yeah.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.191
Are you ready for a better world?

40:18.959 --> 40:20.335
She made her choice.

40:23.964 --> 40:25.465
I don't know what to say.

40:26.842 --> 40:28.468
I understand why she went with him.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.513
She saw a chance, no matter how slim
and risky and she took it.

40:32.097 --> 40:33.181
I would have.

40:35.058 --> 40:36.977
I know it's not easy to let go.

40:38.270 --> 40:39.354
To let go?

40:40.313 --> 40:41.356
Of May?

40:41.731 --> 40:42.899
I'm not letting go.

40:43.483 --> 40:44.693
You heard Radcliffe.

40:44.901 --> 40:48.238
He said he had a subject in the Framework,
someone who was thriving.

40:49.197 --> 40:50.574
He was talking about May.

40:53.326 --> 40:54.494
She's alive.

41:20.896 --> 41:23.398
There's nothing we can do
to sustain her in this life.

41:36.661 --> 41:37.913
It doesn't matter.

41:40.540 --> 41:43.502
In the Framework,
her consciousness will live forever.
