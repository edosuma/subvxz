19:49.222 --> 19:50.672
- Mm-hm.
- No.

19:50.706 --> 19:52.605
But maybe you're
hearing things though.

19:52.639 --> 19:54.676
Maybe noises from above.

19:54.710 --> 19:58.300
It's probably God knocking.
Maybe he's comin' to collect.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.647
What do you think, Mal?

20:01.683 --> 20:04.375
About what?
About... Oh yeah!

20:04.410 --> 20:06.412
I dunno.
Well maybe, I mean,

20:06.446 --> 20:09.035
I don't think God likes
guys who kill woman.

20:09.069 --> 20:11.106
I dunno.
Maybe that's just me.

20:11.140 --> 20:12.659
LENNY: No, probably not!

20:13.073 --> 20:15.352
You guys are cute,
you're having some fun.

20:15.386 --> 20:17.216
Listen, I catch you
on my property again

20:17.250 --> 20:18.527
it's gonna be trouble, okay.

20:18.562 --> 20:22.048
You already got trouble, killer.
Look.

20:23.187 --> 20:26.259
That's right, I'm a killer.
But I don't kill women.

20:26.604 --> 20:29.676
- Oh. Tough ex-Marine, right.
- Right.

20:29.711 --> 20:32.127
- Army.
- Army. Shit.

20:33.301 --> 20:34.440
- Let's go boys.
- All right.

20:34.474 --> 20:36.200
- Sidewalk. Let's go.
- Alright.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.134
Sidewalk.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

20:39.445 --> 20:41.032
Alright.

20:41.067 --> 20:42.620
Don't forget this.

20:43.380 --> 20:46.106
- My walkin' stick now, bitch.
- Yup.

20:48.281 --> 20:51.111
Looked like he was really about
to go at it with those two.

20:51.146 --> 20:54.356
Yeah. Then we'd
have to rush right over.

20:57.117 --> 20:59.085
[loud knock on car window]

21:00.017 --> 21:01.950
- BERNARD: Hard-dee-fuckin'-har.
- [back door opens and closes]

21:02.295 --> 21:04.021
Not funny, Chet.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.230
I thought it was.

21:07.749 --> 21:10.683
- Pack it up, kids.
- What? Why?

21:11.097 --> 21:13.582
We got Diane Fae's cell records.

21:13.617 --> 21:16.413
No calls to or from
a Mr. Steven Warren

21:16.447 --> 21:19.381
- to a Ms. Diane Fae.
- Are you kidding?

21:20.658 --> 21:22.419
Gets even better.

21:23.109 --> 21:27.044
No prints on the screwdriver...
or the car.

21:27.700 --> 21:31.290
Also, I got an expedited
toxicology report.

21:31.566 --> 21:34.293
She's doped to the gills.
Benzo.

21:35.363 --> 21:37.088
If she didn't die
from the stab wound,

21:37.123 --> 21:39.263
downers would have
killed her anyway.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.092
She have a prescription
for Valium?

21:41.127 --> 21:43.405
No, not according
to the husband.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.994
- It's worth looking into.
- WINSLOW: Maybe.

21:49.377 --> 21:53.726
If you guys wanna keep an eye on
him, it's your time, your dime.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.383
- Got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

21:55.417 --> 21:58.524
- Okay, Sarge.
- If not, get some sleep.

21:58.731 --> 22:01.078
- PHILLIPS: Goodnight, Sarge.
- Goodnight.

22:04.253 --> 22:10.639
BERNARD:
Did you know, a fae is
the same thing as a fairy?

22:12.538 --> 22:14.229
Fae...

22:14.263 --> 22:20.477
...a metaphysical, supernatural
or preternatural enchantress

22:20.511 --> 22:25.274
noted for their mischief
and malice.

22:29.486 --> 22:32.040
You are such a fucking dork.

22:33.282 --> 22:35.457
[car starts]

22:42.775 --> 22:46.226
[eerie piano music]

22:53.648 --> 22:55.719
I got your ass!

23:01.380 --> 23:02.622
Hey!

23:03.623 --> 23:05.073
I gotcha.

23:05.763 --> 23:07.282
Come here!

23:10.872 --> 23:12.460
Hi, Steve.

23:13.495 --> 23:15.394
That's my ride, Becca.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.465
That's the guy I've
been telling you about.

23:17.499 --> 23:19.432
You're early, handsome.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.404
DIANE: Why did you break
your promise to me?

23:25.645 --> 23:28.234
You said you'd be dead too.

23:40.211 --> 23:43.594
[wind rustling]

23:53.915 --> 23:56.193
I, uhh...

23:58.954 --> 24:01.509
I found another guy, Steve.

24:03.821 --> 24:05.685
Yeah, who's that, Skip?

24:13.210 --> 24:15.626
You can keep the Briggs
for parts.

24:15.661 --> 24:17.628
[scoffs]

24:27.569 --> 24:31.504
[commuters indistinctly
whispering]

24:36.682 --> 24:38.684
MAX: Saw you on the tube
last night, hot shot.

24:38.718 --> 24:41.203
How'd you end up with
a dead girl in the back yard?

24:41.238 --> 24:44.172
Somebody trying to
send you a message?

24:45.276 --> 24:48.210
You got a message for me?
I'm listening.

24:49.004 --> 24:51.248
Just a theory...

24:51.282 --> 24:53.630
[indistinct chatter]

24:55.701 --> 24:57.496
Oh.

24:58.704 --> 25:01.534
You're the guy. You're the
guy who found the dead girl.

25:01.983 --> 25:04.951
Mike, it's the guy from TV.
He found that dead singer.

25:05.849 --> 25:08.714
I heard that she was, like,
all bloody and disgusting.

25:09.024 --> 25:11.371
Actually, she was beautiful.

25:34.291 --> 25:36.604
Diane Fae.

25:37.846 --> 25:40.297
I know I know you.

25:41.609 --> 25:44.335
[police siren wails in distance]

25:51.377 --> 25:54.691
[police siren approaches]

26:28.828 --> 26:33.384
[engine rattles]

27:07.004 --> 27:09.489
[ghostly whisper]
Tell me you love me.

27:10.421 --> 27:12.492
You promised.

27:55.052 --> 27:58.746
[gun hammer cocking]

28:07.893 --> 28:09.791
[gun chamber slaps shut]

28:52.592 --> 28:56.079
[talking from outside]

28:56.113 --> 28:58.115
You motherfuckers!

29:07.815 --> 29:09.437
Hey!

29:10.024 --> 29:12.474
- Wassup?
- What is it with you guys?

29:12.509 --> 29:14.062
Thought we'd take a look
and see

29:14.097 --> 29:15.823
where you killed
that singer girl.

29:15.857 --> 29:18.515
Yeah, Lenny and I
were just talking...

29:18.549 --> 29:22.174
and, umm, we don't like guys who
kill women living on our street.

29:22.208 --> 29:24.141
- Okay.
- It's not good for the...

29:24.176 --> 29:26.523
- Ya know...
- Who wants the first punch?

29:26.557 --> 29:28.974
- What?
- First one's free.

29:29.008 --> 29:31.631
Okay, well... you serious?

29:31.839 --> 29:33.185
There's two of us
and one of you.

29:33.219 --> 29:34.911
You each get one.

29:34.945 --> 29:37.258
- We're gonna kill you.
- Sounds good, man.

29:37.292 --> 29:39.605
[laughing] Really?

29:39.916 --> 29:41.193
Wow.

29:43.126 --> 29:45.956
Alright, ya know, fuck it.
Let's just... Do it.

29:45.991 --> 29:47.544
- Lenny...
- Yeah.

29:47.578 --> 29:49.166
There ya go.

29:49.201 --> 29:50.858
Let me just...
I don't want to...

29:50.892 --> 29:52.549
Gotta save that for later.

29:52.583 --> 29:53.584
Do you want to?

29:53.619 --> 29:55.932
- All you, Mal.
- Really? That's nice of you.

29:55.966 --> 29:58.762
But, seriously, go.
I don't even wanna...

29:58.797 --> 30:00.799
Uh! Fuck!

30:02.145 --> 30:04.009
Get up, bitch, get up.

30:04.043 --> 30:05.907
Alright, Steve-O,
your fuckin' shot.

30:05.942 --> 30:08.807
Get up, my man, get up.
Oh fuck!

30:08.841 --> 30:10.601
[body thuds to the ground]

30:10.947 --> 30:13.121
Oh, that fuckin...

30:13.156 --> 30:17.091
Fuck. Ahh! Fuck, dude, my
fucking right and my left ear.

30:17.125 --> 30:18.230
Owww!

30:18.264 --> 30:20.163
I ever see you again,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

30:20.197 --> 30:21.785
Yeah. I... I... Owww!!

30:21.820 --> 30:23.960
Owww! Alright! Fuck!

30:24.167 --> 30:25.685
STEVE: Take this fucking cane
with you!

30:25.720 --> 30:27.826
I don't want the fucking cane!

30:28.999 --> 30:32.623
[howling wind]

30:35.834 --> 30:39.009
[howling wind]

30:58.753 --> 31:00.962
Ya little prick.

31:13.733 --> 31:17.772
- [TV channel surfing zaps]
- Hey, babe! Can I get a beer?

31:18.186 --> 31:21.293
- What's the magic word?
- Abracadabra.

31:21.327 --> 31:23.847
Oh, you need to get a new joke!

31:24.089 --> 31:27.126
- [laughing]
- STEVE: Oh, someone's fast.

31:27.678 --> 31:30.923
- Oh, you're quick. Come here!
- No, no! Stop! Be careful!

31:30.958 --> 31:33.684
- Come here!
- [laughter]

31:33.892 --> 31:35.997
Stop tickling me!

31:36.273 --> 31:37.965
I'm gonna pee this couch!

31:37.999 --> 31:39.380
Oh, you're gonna
pee on the couch?

31:39.414 --> 31:41.623
-Yes.
-You're gonna pee. That's gross.

31:41.658 --> 31:43.349
[giggling]

31:44.040 --> 31:46.318
- Did you pee?
- No.

31:47.871 --> 31:49.838
Tell me you love me.

31:49.873 --> 31:51.599
I love you.

31:51.979 --> 31:55.361
[indistinct chatter from TV]

32:01.298 --> 32:02.886
DIANE: No, Steve.

32:03.128 --> 32:05.647
This is the only place
that we can be together.

32:07.235 --> 32:12.033
If you do what you promised, we
can be anywhere you want to be.

32:17.763 --> 32:19.351
Ah!

32:21.698 --> 32:23.700
Together forever.

32:24.804 --> 32:27.083
Together forever and ever.

32:34.193 --> 32:36.644
DIANE: Tell me you love me.

32:39.405 --> 32:41.407
MAX: Help you with something?

32:41.890 --> 32:43.375
Security camera.

32:43.409 --> 32:46.102
MAX: Yeah, I'd be paranoid
if I were you, too.

32:46.792 --> 32:48.690
You got it or not?

32:48.725 --> 32:50.692
MAX: So you been thinking
about my theory?

32:50.727 --> 32:52.901
Someone trying
to send me a message?

32:53.350 --> 32:55.974
No, I thought whoever
did it might come back.

32:56.871 --> 32:58.252
Hmm.

32:59.011 --> 33:00.944
Does this stuff even work?

33:01.289 --> 33:03.015
Yeah, it works great.

33:03.050 --> 33:05.086
Three-hundred-sixty-five days,
ten years,

33:05.121 --> 33:07.744
never failed me.
Then I went digital.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.849
How much?

33:09.884 --> 33:12.059
MAX: Everything all in,
for you, fifty bucks.

33:12.093 --> 33:14.993
- For me. Twenty.
- Twenty?

33:15.200 --> 33:17.029
Tapes. High grade,
premium tapes.

33:17.064 --> 33:18.997
I've worked on the camera.
I've worked on the deck.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.895
Everything in front of you
is gonna work fabulous.

33:20.929 --> 33:23.035
Work with me a little bit.
Forty-five dollars.

33:23.070 --> 33:24.933
Bunch of old stuff.
I'll give you twenty.

33:24.968 --> 33:26.970
Okay, the whole idea
of negotiation

33:27.005 --> 33:29.938
is meet somewhere in the middle.
Can you help me a little bit?

33:29.973 --> 33:32.734
- I got twenty.
- Twenty. Twenty cash?

33:32.769 --> 33:35.220
- Yeah.
- Fine. Done.

33:35.254 --> 33:37.049
I hope your killer
does come back.

33:37.084 --> 33:38.809
Me too.

33:48.819 --> 33:50.787
That's for glass.

33:51.098 --> 33:53.238
What's the point of that anyway?

33:53.272 --> 33:55.136
It's therapeutic.

33:55.481 --> 33:58.105
- Where's your cane?
- I threw it out.

33:58.415 --> 34:02.074
- Still got the limp, I see.
- Yeah. I'm working on it.

34:02.523 --> 34:05.250
How did that happen, anyway?

34:05.457 --> 34:08.011
Defending democracy.

34:08.253 --> 34:10.462
Benzodiazepine?

34:11.152 --> 34:12.878
Valium?

34:13.534 --> 34:16.433
Someone drugged her
and then they stabbed her?

34:16.467 --> 34:19.022
We, uh, we don't
know what happened.

34:19.436 --> 34:21.887
Maybe you know
something we don't.

34:22.922 --> 34:25.270
You're Bernard, right?

34:25.304 --> 34:28.376
- And you're Detective Phillips?
- That's right.

34:28.411 --> 34:30.929
Just trying to keep this
straight...

34:31.172 --> 34:33.380
'Cause Bernard's
the commie, right?

34:33.416 --> 34:35.003
[amused laughter]

34:35.038 --> 34:37.246
And you definitely
didn't know her?

34:37.282 --> 34:38.973
Again, no.

34:39.007 --> 34:41.009
Do you have any enemies?

34:41.871 --> 34:44.322
A few guys in the neighborhood,
a couple punks,

34:44.358 --> 34:46.152
giving me a hard time
about this.

34:46.187 --> 34:47.809
But no, I don't
have any enemies...

34:47.844 --> 34:49.259
not on this side
of the Atlantic.

34:49.293 --> 34:52.366
You took someone's
favorite seat on the bus...

34:52.849 --> 34:55.161
You complained that
your neighbor's rap music

34:55.196 --> 34:56.887
was too loud...

34:56.922 --> 34:59.338
You're banging somebody's
wife... Something like that?

34:59.373 --> 35:02.203
It's too weird to be
a coincidence for me too.

35:04.171 --> 35:06.207
I was thinking that
the killer always returns

35:06.242 --> 35:08.002
to the scene of the crime.

35:08.036 --> 35:11.212
So, I'm gonna get him on tape.

35:14.077 --> 35:15.561
And...

35:15.941 --> 35:19.910
you guys are amazing
and I hate to burst your bubble

35:19.945 --> 35:22.292
but you're not the first
with a theory

35:22.327 --> 35:25.261
that someone was trying
to send me a message.

35:25.295 --> 35:27.021
Or that I had an enemy.

35:27.055 --> 35:29.265
Guy that sold me
that had the same idea.

35:35.340 --> 35:38.066
Did you know
the victim was married?

35:39.309 --> 35:42.554
No.
I didn't see or read that.

35:42.588 --> 35:46.351
Husband thinks his little singer
was cheating on him.

35:47.593 --> 35:50.078
So now I'm bangin'
someone's wife?

35:51.563 --> 35:53.116
You guys want
some straight answers,

35:53.151 --> 35:55.118
give me some straight questions.

35:55.153 --> 35:58.190
- Were you fucking her, Steve?
- No.

35:58.466 --> 36:02.090
If I had been,
she'd still be alive.

36:02.125 --> 36:04.162
Ha! You would have
protected her, is that it?

36:04.196 --> 36:06.129
STEVE: That's right.

36:07.579 --> 36:13.240
One more question: Diane
performed on stage that night,

36:13.274 --> 36:18.141
she left the theater, and
no one ever saw her again.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.281
Is there a question?

36:20.316 --> 36:24.043
- Did you kill Diane Fae?
- No.

36:24.078 --> 36:26.598
Do you know
who killed Diane Fae?

it was my fault!

I tried to give her a good life,

49:03.043 --> 49:05.218

But I could barely make ends
meet, let alone afford a place

would come

and that they would
take her away

51:16.556 --> 51:20.249

why don't you do
something about it?

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:26.001
- Like what?
- Like get rid of it.

01:00:26.036 --> 01:00:28.417
Uhh, I still need it.

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:31.041
You hardly even limp.

01:00:31.075 --> 01:00:34.631
I promise you, if you get rid
of that you'd be just fine.

01:00:36.736 --> 01:00:38.393
If it bothers you that much

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:40.464
why don't you talk
to somebody about it?

01:00:41.948 --> 01:00:44.537
I don't really have anyone
to talk to.

01:00:45.055 --> 01:00:48.921
All my friends back here,
they moved away a long time ago.

01:00:49.784 --> 01:00:53.373
And the friends I left behind,
the ones that made it back,

01:00:53.408 --> 01:00:55.755
they live in other states,
have families...

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.413
reenlisted...

01:00:58.793 --> 01:01:01.002
or disappeared.

01:01:01.934 --> 01:01:04.419
I don't know where they...

01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.665
I don't have any friends
or family.

01:01:08.699 --> 01:01:09.976
Maybe that's my problem.

01:01:10.011 --> 01:01:11.875
[awkward laugh]

01:01:12.565 --> 01:01:14.947
I guess I'm depressed.

01:01:15.602 --> 01:01:19.676
- Ridiculous...
- No. Those are real problems.

01:01:23.093 --> 01:01:24.819
Not like mine.

01:01:26.786 --> 01:01:28.408
Like what?

01:01:30.169 --> 01:01:32.205
Do you really wanna hear?

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.000
If you wanna tell me.

01:01:34.035 --> 01:01:37.521
Well, I'm a failure.

01:01:37.935 --> 01:01:39.834
That's my problem.

01:01:40.144 --> 01:01:43.113
Luck, timing, talent: those
are the three things you need

01:01:43.147 --> 01:01:44.977
in this business,
and in that order,

01:01:45.011 --> 01:01:46.219
unless you have connections.

01:01:46.254 --> 01:01:48.843
You kidding me. With your looks
and how talented you are.

01:01:48.877 --> 01:01:51.811
No. No, that only got me
halfway there.

01:01:52.225 --> 01:01:55.781
I mean, I did a few
Broadway chorus-lines;.

01:01:55.815 --> 01:01:57.990
I had great representation.

01:01:58.922 --> 01:02:01.821
I fronted a lounge act
for a while,

01:02:01.856 --> 01:02:04.582
and, you know,
that was fun, it's just...

01:02:04.617 --> 01:02:07.447
I even did
a major label showcase!

01:02:12.487 --> 01:02:14.144
And then, the big city,
the expenses,

01:02:14.178 --> 01:02:16.491
they just caught up to me.

01:02:18.804 --> 01:02:21.807
And the only one to catch
my fall was the wrong guy.

01:02:22.186 --> 01:02:24.119
Your husband.

01:02:24.602 --> 01:02:26.743
My husband.

01:02:27.053 --> 01:02:30.677
He had a steady job.
He's hardly a Rockefeller.

01:02:33.819 --> 01:02:35.717
I know.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.754
Hey, we all make
bad decisions, right?

01:02:37.788 --> 01:02:39.514
Tell me about it.

01:02:41.965 --> 01:02:45.831
Hey, you were so good tonight.
Great. You were great tonight.

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:48.695
Thank you.

01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:51.975
But there were like five people
in the audience. [chuckles]

01:02:52.699 --> 01:02:54.874
God, I seriously don't know
why I do it anymore.

01:02:54.909 --> 01:02:56.565
It makes me want to kill myself.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.845
Well, it's a good thing we met.
I'm your number one fan.

01:02:59.879 --> 01:03:02.986
- Oh.
- There's six of us, I think.

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.539
[Diane laughs]

01:03:04.573 --> 01:03:06.817
Well,
that's a big responsibility.

01:03:08.992 --> 01:03:11.132
I'm your man.

01:03:12.616 --> 01:03:14.238
Do you mean that?

01:03:14.721 --> 01:03:16.654
Definitely.

01:03:18.656 --> 01:03:21.901
[inaudible chatter]

01:03:21.936 --> 01:03:23.972
Thanks for coming to my show.

01:03:24.007 --> 01:03:25.974
Told you I would.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.876
This'll make a great picture.

01:03:31.773 --> 01:03:33.154
No.

01:03:33.982 --> 01:03:35.984
No pictures.

01:03:36.019 --> 01:03:38.159
Let's just remember this.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.852
Can I see you again?

01:03:57.764 --> 01:04:00.146
My husband would be so jealous.

01:04:01.251 --> 01:04:03.218
Why'd you do it?

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:06.670
Because...

01:04:09.121 --> 01:04:11.986
I feel like we fit.

01:04:12.814 --> 01:04:15.679
- We connect, ya know?
- Yeah.

01:04:18.751 --> 01:04:20.960
You want to see me again?

01:04:22.065 --> 01:04:23.929
Do you know where
Front Street is?

01:04:23.963 --> 01:04:25.758
It's like three blocks
from my house.

01:04:25.792 --> 01:04:27.208
Good.

01:04:27.242 --> 01:04:29.866
There's a house there
that I go to be alone.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.591
It's been for sale a long time.

01:04:31.626 --> 01:04:33.593
Belonged to a girl
I went to theater with.

01:04:33.628 --> 01:04:37.183
I used to go feed her cats when
she was away and I kept a key.

01:04:37.943 --> 01:04:39.668
You know, we could
just meet at my place.

01:04:39.703 --> 01:04:42.085
No. No.

01:04:42.119 --> 01:04:44.708
This is perfect.

01:04:44.742 --> 01:04:47.745
The realtor only shows
the house on Sunday.

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:51.922
And it's my secret place
so we won't get caught.

01:04:51.957 --> 01:04:53.993
We can't get caught.

01:04:54.407 --> 01:04:57.894
So no pictures,
no texts, no calls.

01:04:57.928 --> 01:04:59.930
We won't even exchange numbers.

01:04:59.965 --> 01:05:03.865
Let's just remember
when and where,

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.971
just like we'll
remember tonight.

01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:07.973
Okay.

01:05:11.804 --> 01:05:13.944
This'll be our little secret.

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:17.361
I won't tell anyone.

01:05:17.983 --> 01:05:19.985
And neither will you.

01:05:20.778 --> 01:05:23.609
- I don't have anyone to tell.
- [Diane chuckles]

01:05:24.265 --> 01:05:26.060
Okay.

01:05:27.164 --> 01:05:29.787
Well, I'll see
you tomorrow night.

01:05:31.858 --> 01:05:33.999
Could I get a ride home first?

01:05:34.965 --> 01:05:38.279
[chuckles]
God, just this once.

01:05:38.796 --> 01:05:41.661
[car approaching]

01:05:56.918 --> 01:06:00.715
[sexual moaning]

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:24.118
[moaning continues]

01:06:33.851 --> 01:06:36.268
This is our secret place.

01:06:37.303 --> 01:06:39.409
Just you and me.

01:06:56.288 --> 01:06:57.910
STEVE: You in this?

01:06:57.944 --> 01:07:01.189
DIANE: Yeah. Reduced
to community theater.

01:07:04.192 --> 01:07:06.712
[Diane giggles]

01:07:11.096 --> 01:07:13.201
This is where we meet.

01:07:13.512 --> 01:07:15.445
Nowhere else.

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:18.137
Wherever.

01:07:22.348 --> 01:07:26.111
DIANE: I had my shot. I just
do this to torture myself.

01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:32.945
I love you, Diane.

01:07:42.265 --> 01:07:45.475
DIANE: I'm a failure.
That's my problem.

01:07:52.206 --> 01:07:54.311
Tell me you love me.

01:07:56.831 --> 01:07:58.488
I love you.

01:08:03.355 --> 01:08:07.497
If you really love me,
you'll do what I want.

01:08:10.327 --> 01:08:12.467
DIANE: God, I seriously don't
know why I do it anymore.

01:08:12.502 --> 01:08:14.987
It makes me want to kill myself.

01:08:18.059 --> 01:08:21.269
[Diane sighs]

01:08:22.511 --> 01:08:25.135
I was put on this Earth
to be a singer.

01:08:25.997 --> 01:08:28.448
Not somebody's
pretty little princess.

01:08:29.207 --> 01:08:31.176
God, if you're capable
of doing what you love

01:08:31.210 --> 01:08:33.178
then you're a privileged soul.

01:08:33.212 --> 01:08:35.456
A nurse, an architect,
it doesn't matter what it is.

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:38.183
If you were born to do it,
it is true sailing.

01:08:39.218 --> 01:08:42.394
"True sailing is dead."
Jim Morrison said that.

01:08:47.019 --> 01:08:49.470
"No one here gets out alive."

01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:01.067
Let's face it, when you're
quoting Jim Morrison lyrics

01:09:01.102 --> 01:09:04.001
it's time for you
to kill yourself.

01:09:06.245 --> 01:09:07.902
Come on...

01:09:09.075 --> 01:09:12.457
If you love me,
you'll do this with me.

01:09:17.497 --> 01:09:20.121
We'll be famous.

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:29.165
We'll die right here, together,

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:32.133
and we'll film it on a phone.

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:36.171
And when they find it,
it'll go viral.

01:09:43.006 --> 01:09:44.939
I have nothing.

01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:49.185
You have nothing.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.053
Please.

01:09:58.435 --> 01:10:00.989
Please do this with me.

01:10:03.026 --> 01:10:06.098
You don't want to live
here without me, do you?

01:10:06.409 --> 01:10:08.894
I can't live without you.

01:10:13.554 --> 01:10:15.625
Then die with me.

01:10:19.629 --> 01:10:22.321
I can't just sit here and wait.

01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:29.363
- Tell me you love me.
- I love you.

01:10:36.335 --> 01:10:38.130
Promise me.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.237
I promise.

01:11:11.232 --> 01:11:13.338
[pill bottle snaps open]

01:11:21.242 --> 01:11:23.313
Just wait, just wait.

01:11:23.348 --> 01:11:25.729
No, no, don't.
Let's just stop for a second.

01:11:25.764 --> 01:11:27.317
- No.
- Just stop for a second.

01:11:27.352 --> 01:11:29.733
- We gotta just do it.
- I don't want you to do this.

01:11:29.768 --> 01:11:31.632
- Steve, stop.
- I don't want you to do this.

01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:33.116
Are you fucking kidding
me right now?

01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:35.083
- Stop. Stop.
- Steve, stop!

01:11:35.118 --> 01:11:36.706
Stop it, stop it!

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:39.053
Stop it! Stop it!

Stop!

Stop!

Give me my phone!

01:11:58.244 --> 01:12:01.489
Fuck you!
Get the fuck out!

01:12:01.524 --> 01:12:03.215
Get out!

01:12:03.422 --> 01:12:05.804
God, you fucking coward!

01:12:05.838 --> 01:12:07.702
You promised!

to yourself anymore.

You remember now.

01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:31.725
Now keep your promise to me.

I don't love you anymore.
