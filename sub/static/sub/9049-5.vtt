WEBVTT

00:04.941 --> 00:06.908
The rules are simple.

00:06.910 --> 00:09.644
First, we shake up this can
of carbonation extreme,

00:09.646 --> 00:11.780
the most carbonated
drink in the world...

00:11.782 --> 00:13.682
Then we shut our eyes
and mix them up.

00:16.886 --> 00:19.921
And now, we open them to see
who gets sprayed in the face.

00:19.923 --> 00:21.289
I'll go first.

00:25.562 --> 00:27.929
Whew. Me next.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.635
Ah! I feel so alive!

00:36.506 --> 00:37.606
Your turn, Ally.

00:39.342 --> 00:41.309
Yeah, I'm not opening that can.

00:41.311 --> 00:42.677
- What?
- Oh, come on!

00:42.679 --> 00:43.879
- That's the whole point!
- Come on!

00:43.881 --> 00:45.580
Guess who has to
do a book report!

00:45.582 --> 00:48.784
On some stupid book called,
theLonely Maiden's Journey.

00:48.786 --> 00:50.986
This is horrible! What
am I supposed to do?

00:50.988 --> 00:53.555
This might sound a little crazy,

00:53.557 --> 00:57.292
but maybe read the book, then
write a report about it?

00:57.294 --> 00:58.393
Eh.

00:58.395 --> 00:59.895
Anyone have any better ideas?

00:59.897 --> 01:02.964
Oh! You could do what I always do...
instead of writing book reports,

01:02.966 --> 01:05.834
I make a video about the book,
and I always get a good grade.

01:05.836 --> 01:07.302
He lets me act in them.

01:07.304 --> 01:09.738
Last week, I got to be
Antony and Cleopatra.

01:09.740 --> 01:10.333
Whoo!

01:10.364 --> 01:11.983
Why didn't you ask
me to be Cleopatra?

01:12.014 --> 01:13.014
You?

01:15.678 --> 01:17.979
Well, Trish, maybe Dez can
help you with your assignment?

01:17.981 --> 01:21.750
Huh. That's not a bad idea.

01:21.752 --> 01:24.820
Dez can direct, and
I can star in it!

01:24.822 --> 01:26.521
I'm in! Here!

01:26.523 --> 01:29.558
Let's celebrate our video with
a can of carbonation extreme.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.001 --> 01:41.336
Wow. That is extreme.

03:03.019 --> 03:04.085
Wow.

03:04.087 --> 03:05.987
That was amazing!

03:05.989 --> 03:08.023
Are you waiting for a lesson?

03:08.025 --> 03:09.791
I hope not.

03:09.793 --> 03:11.626
She is way better than me.

03:13.095 --> 03:15.931
I know. I'm way better
than most people.

03:15.933 --> 03:17.365
There's nothing
you can teach me.

03:17.367 --> 03:19.935
Well, I could teach you modesty.

03:21.370 --> 03:23.860
Well, I don't like to
brag, but I'm actually

03:23.872 --> 03:26.374
better at modesty than
most people, too.

03:28.110 --> 03:30.078
So, why are you here?

03:30.080 --> 03:32.113
You're gonna be teaching
my sister, Shelby.

03:32.115 --> 03:36.017
I'm just dropping her off and
setting the bar impossibly high.

03:36.019 --> 03:37.986
Good luck, sis.

03:37.988 --> 03:39.754
Bye, Violet.

03:39.756 --> 03:41.523
Hey, Shelby.

03:41.525 --> 03:44.793
Man, if your sister is that good,
you must be pretty good, too.

03:44.795 --> 03:45.802
Nope.

03:45.833 --> 03:49.831
Well, I'm sure you've got some
understanding of how to play?

03:49.833 --> 03:51.499
Nope.

03:51.501 --> 03:54.069
Have you ever
picked up a violin?

03:54.071 --> 03:59.474
I tried playing once, but I was so bad
my teacher quit after one lesson.

03:59.476 --> 04:01.643
Well, that's terrible!

04:01.645 --> 04:04.012
Your teacher didn't
even give you a chance.

04:04.014 --> 04:06.114
What an awful, horrible person.

04:06.116 --> 04:07.983
My teacher was my sister.

04:09.719 --> 04:12.954
Oh. But she seemed so nice.

04:14.523 --> 04:16.458
I wish I had a musical talent.

04:16.459 --> 04:19.827
Well, I believe everybody
has talent inside them,

04:19.829 --> 04:25.533
and with some lessons and practice,
I promise I can make you great...

04:25.535 --> 04:26.358
Like your sister.

04:26.389 --> 04:29.504
You really think you can
make me as good as Violet?

04:29.506 --> 04:31.139
Uh, yeah.

04:31.141 --> 04:32.507
I can't wait to start.

04:32.509 --> 04:33.942
Okay, just fill out this form.

04:33.944 --> 04:36.645
Can you give us a sec?

04:37.913 --> 04:39.080
Ally, what are you doing?

04:39.082 --> 04:40.715
You're getting this
girl's hopes up.

04:40.717 --> 04:42.817
I know I can help her!

04:42.819 --> 04:46.054
We started the A&A music factory
to help people just like Shelby.

04:46.056 --> 04:48.590
I know, but you promised her
she'd be as good as her sister,

04:48.592 --> 04:49.824
and you haven't even
heard her play.

04:49.826 --> 04:51.993
She can't be that bad.

04:54.965 --> 04:56.931
Okay. Okay.

04:56.933 --> 04:58.867
You don't know that's her.

04:58.869 --> 05:00.669
I'm looking right at her.

05:12.548 --> 05:15.183
This video book report
is a great idea, Dez.

05:15.185 --> 05:18.019
It combines two of my
greatest passions in life...

05:18.021 --> 05:19.821
acting...

05:19.823 --> 05:21.589
And taking the easy way out.

05:21.591 --> 05:25.660
So, tell me, what do you know
about aLonely Maiden's Journey?

05:25.662 --> 05:29.197
I know that it's a book, and I
know that I don't want to read it.

05:29.199 --> 05:32.867
The story opens up on
our heroine, Cecilia.

05:32.869 --> 05:35.509
The war has just ended,
and she must travel

05:35.521 --> 05:38.173
by foot to the north
with her baby, Scarlet.

05:40.843 --> 05:44.279
Uh, this is a giant sausage.

05:44.281 --> 05:46.147
Yeah. We can't afford
a real baby...

05:46.149 --> 05:49.117
Or lunch, and I am starving.

05:49.119 --> 05:50.585
Give me Scarlet.

05:53.756 --> 05:56.524
Mmm. That is good sausage baby.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.260
Let's start with
the crying scene.

05:59.262 --> 06:00.895
I'll just grab some onions.

06:00.897 --> 06:03.131
Oh, I'm an amazing actress.

06:03.133 --> 06:04.632
I don't need onions
to help me cry.

06:04.634 --> 06:06.206
Oh, no. In this scene,
you're crying because

06:06.218 --> 06:07.802
the villagers are
throwing onions at you

06:07.804 --> 06:08.903
to get you off their property.

06:08.905 --> 06:11.272
And action!

06:19.982 --> 06:22.851
The key is to have a
soft, delicate touch.

06:30.794 --> 06:33.294
Now, you try.

06:33.296 --> 06:36.097
Okay. Delicate.

06:42.638 --> 06:45.707
Uh, maybe...

06:45.709 --> 06:48.109
Even more delicate than that.

06:49.311 --> 06:51.079
How's it going in here?

06:51.081 --> 06:54.048
Good. So good.

06:54.050 --> 06:56.251
This girl has a
lot of potential.

06:56.253 --> 06:59.120
Stay right there. We're gonna...

07:03.826 --> 07:07.162
I don't want you to hear Shelby until
she's totally perfected her technique.

07:07.164 --> 07:11.766
Well, from downstairs, her technique sounds
like two raccoons fighting in a dumpster.

07:11.768 --> 07:14.068
Stop being so negative.

07:14.070 --> 07:15.937
I can get her there.

07:15.939 --> 07:19.007
In fact, I'll bet you I can
have her concert ready

07:19.009 --> 07:20.842
by the next friends
and family night.

07:20.844 --> 07:22.110
Oh, really?

07:22.112 --> 07:25.619
Sure, and if I fail, I'll
make you a five-foot pancake.

07:25.650 --> 07:29.651
Like the one we saw on that TV show,
America's biggest breakfast foods?

07:29.653 --> 07:31.186
Yup.

07:32.154 --> 07:34.923
Okay. And what do you
want if you win?

07:35.891 --> 07:39.127
Huh. I hadn't really
thought about it,

07:39.129 --> 07:42.831
but I guess, off the top
of my head, maybe...

07:42.833 --> 07:45.400
This beautiful, one-of-a-kind,
designer sterling silver necklace

07:45.402 --> 07:47.168
with a moon charm pendant
from Jilly & Sons.

07:47.170 --> 07:49.871
Off the top of your head, huh?

07:49.873 --> 07:53.308
I'll email you the info,
'cause you're going down!

07:53.310 --> 07:56.110
Downtown!

07:56.112 --> 07:58.112
'Cause, uh...

07:58.114 --> 07:59.474
That's where the
jewelry store is.

08:03.152 --> 08:05.687
Uh, where do you keep
the violin glue?

08:14.663 --> 08:18.733
It has been three long days
since I have set foot on land,

08:18.735 --> 08:23.671
and I am sitting on this block
of ice, freezing my buns off!

08:23.673 --> 08:26.975
And if the director doesn't
yell cut in five seconds,

08:26.977 --> 08:28.243
- I'm gonna...
- Cut!

08:29.778 --> 08:32.714
Trish, none of that
is in the script.

08:32.716 --> 08:34.849
But I can't feel my legs.

08:34.851 --> 08:37.684
I know you said using real
ice is more professional,

08:37.687 --> 08:39.287
but can we please
use the fake stuff?

08:40.722 --> 08:45.293
I'm sorry. My watch must be broken,
'cause I had no idea it was amateur hour!

08:45.295 --> 08:47.195
I'm freezing!

08:47.197 --> 08:49.297
I've been sitting on this
block of ice for two hours!

08:49.299 --> 08:52.367
Well, Cecilia was stuck on the iceberg
for two days! Did she complain?

08:52.369 --> 08:54.736
I don't know! I
didn't read the book!

08:54.738 --> 08:58.206
Look, we've been doing
crazy stunts all day.

08:58.208 --> 09:02.343
Isn't there a scene where I'm laying
down, taking a nap, or something?

09:02.345 --> 09:04.379
Fine. Let's do the desert scene.

09:04.381 --> 09:07.115
All you have to do is
lie down on the sand...

09:07.117 --> 09:09.083
Oh, sounds good. I can do that.

09:09.085 --> 09:11.419
Then I cover you with
these live tarantulas!

09:11.421 --> 09:12.453
Aah!

09:12.455 --> 09:14.989
Ooh! Good scream, but I
think you can do better.

09:14.991 --> 09:16.324
- Live tarantulas!
- Aah!

09:16.326 --> 09:18.226
That's the one.

09:21.030 --> 09:24.198
So, I've got all my dance students
ready for friends and family night.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.900
What do you think
of this dance move?

09:31.140 --> 09:33.174
Not bad.

09:33.176 --> 09:34.876
Speaking of friends
and family night,

09:34.878 --> 09:36.511
Shelby's been getting a
lot better at violin.

09:36.513 --> 09:37.779
Listen.

09:37.781 --> 09:40.703
Shelby, show him what you got.

09:48.123 --> 09:51.025
Huh. Wow. That's really
good for just a week.

09:51.027 --> 09:53.161
Pfft! Really good?

09:53.163 --> 09:55.196
You should see what I
could do after one week.

09:55.198 --> 09:57.131
Oh, and you can!

09:57.133 --> 09:58.466
Because it's still online.

09:58.468 --> 10:00.335
Here we go.

10:00.337 --> 10:03.471
"Three-year-old girl wows
crowd at carnegie hall."

10:08.144 --> 10:11.212
How did you get your little
toddler fingers to move so fast?

10:11.214 --> 10:13.881
Well, I did have the
best teacher...

10:13.883 --> 10:14.916
me!

10:14.918 --> 10:16.217
I'm self-taught!

10:16.219 --> 10:18.119
Okay. We get it.

10:18.121 --> 10:20.455
You're the talented
one, and I'm not.

10:20.457 --> 10:22.890
I don't even know why
I bother trying.

10:22.892 --> 10:24.025
I quit.

10:24.027 --> 10:26.194
Wha... Shelby, wait!

10:28.797 --> 10:31.299
So, you want to see
the video again?

10:31.301 --> 10:32.934
Of course you do.

10:46.181 --> 10:48.416
If you're here for your
pancake, I didn't make it yet.

10:48.418 --> 10:51.219
I had to special order
an extra large griddle.

10:51.221 --> 10:53.187
I don't care about the pancake.

10:53.189 --> 10:57.125
Delicious, fluffy,
five-foot pancake...

10:59.028 --> 11:01.963
Ugh. I can't believe
Shelby quit.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.865
I tried so hard.

11:03.867 --> 11:06.200
And you were making
a lot of progress.

11:06.202 --> 11:08.202
I really thought
you'd pull it off.

11:09.138 --> 11:11.706
Then why did you bring in
this huge pad of butter?

11:15.511 --> 11:17.211
I was just teasing.

11:17.213 --> 11:19.147
I'm sorry.

11:19.149 --> 11:21.115
But...

11:21.117 --> 11:23.618
Here. I got you this.

11:28.123 --> 11:30.058
Austin!

11:30.060 --> 11:34.028
You got me the moon necklace?

11:34.030 --> 11:36.064
And you added a sun.

11:36.066 --> 11:41.335
Yeah. That's you and me...
Austin moon, Ally daw-sun.

11:41.337 --> 11:45.206
Aww, thanks, Austin.

11:45.208 --> 11:47.942
But... I lost the bet.

11:47.944 --> 11:50.211
It doesn't matter.

11:50.213 --> 11:52.080
I bought you this because
I believe in you.

11:52.082 --> 11:54.048
Look at the back.

11:55.384 --> 12:00.588
"I believe in you, "and
together, we can go fart."

12:00.590 --> 12:03.257
They ran out of room.

12:03.259 --> 12:04.492
It was supposed to say,

12:04.494 --> 12:07.228
"together, we can go
farther than the moon."

12:08.464 --> 12:11.299
Aww.

12:14.136 --> 12:16.971
I still feel so
bad about Shelby.

12:16.973 --> 12:19.140
- Yeah.
- What can we do?

12:19.142 --> 12:20.942
Hey.

12:20.944 --> 12:23.111
Maybe we can teach her
something besides the violin?

12:23.113 --> 12:25.313
That's a great idea!

12:25.315 --> 12:27.415
If we can find that thing
that she's good at,

12:27.417 --> 12:29.617
she'll stop comparing
herself to her sister.

12:29.619 --> 12:32.420
When you were working with her, did
you notice any hidden talents?

12:32.422 --> 12:36.157
Uh, she's good at
breaking things?

12:36.159 --> 12:37.992
Yeah.

12:43.132 --> 12:46.534
Help!

12:46.536 --> 12:48.069
Oh!

12:48.071 --> 12:49.270
Trish?

12:49.272 --> 12:51.205
Can you guys help me!

12:52.474 --> 12:54.142
Oh, hurry up!

12:54.144 --> 12:55.676
Oh, I'm getting really dizzy.

12:55.678 --> 12:57.545
Ugh.

12:57.547 --> 12:59.280
- Oh, oh...
- Okay...

12:59.282 --> 13:01.983
Slowly. Slowly, still spinning.
Slowly.

13:01.985 --> 13:02.685
Ugh.

13:02.716 --> 13:05.486
- I got you, I got you.
- The room is still spinning.

13:05.488 --> 13:07.188
Oh, here you go.

13:10.058 --> 13:12.226
Wait, look what Austin got me.

13:12.228 --> 13:13.327
Seriously?

13:13.329 --> 13:14.562
Sorry.

13:14.564 --> 13:16.030
Why were you hanging up there?

13:16.032 --> 13:19.233
Dez hung me up here for
my video book report,

13:19.235 --> 13:22.170
then that doof realized he
forgot the baby at school.

13:22.172 --> 13:24.705
You left a baby at school?

13:24.707 --> 13:28.676
It's a sausage baby. Don't ask.

13:28.678 --> 13:32.680
<i>Wait, I thought your book report
was on aLonely Maiden's Journey?</i>

13:32.682 --> 13:34.248
It is.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.984
This is the part where the
baby, played by a sausage,

13:36.986 --> 13:40.254
accidentally crawls out of the
helicopter, then the maiden,

13:40.256 --> 13:42.256
played by yours truly,
jumps out to rescue her.

13:42.258 --> 13:44.091
- Cool.
- What?

13:44.093 --> 13:47.762
You know none of that stuff
happens in the book, right?

13:47.764 --> 13:50.131
Excuse me?

13:50.133 --> 13:53.034
Yeah. You have the
book right here.

13:54.336 --> 13:56.470
It takes place right
after the civil war.

13:56.472 --> 13:58.406
They didn't even have
helicopters then.

13:58.408 --> 14:00.274
Wait...

14:00.276 --> 14:02.243
Does Cecilia get
stuck on an iceberg?

14:02.245 --> 14:04.278
Does she get attacked
by tarantulas?

14:04.280 --> 14:06.214
Fall down an elevator shaft?

14:06.216 --> 14:07.515
Dodge exploding hockey pucks?

14:07.517 --> 14:09.150
Get her leg stuck in the toilet?

14:09.152 --> 14:12.420
This sounds like the
best book ever!

14:12.422 --> 14:15.590
Except none of that
stuff happens.

14:15.592 --> 14:17.391
Dez!

14:17.393 --> 14:18.659
Give me that!

14:18.661 --> 14:21.262
Whoa.

14:21.264 --> 14:22.363
Still kind of dizzy.

14:23.732 --> 14:24.765
- Oh.
- Oh!

14:24.767 --> 14:26.267
Good. Shelby, you're here!

14:26.269 --> 14:28.336
I got your message.

14:28.338 --> 14:29.770
I don't know why you called.

14:29.772 --> 14:32.807
I told you, I'm done
taking violin lessons.

14:32.809 --> 14:34.742
That's what we want
to talk to you about.

14:34.744 --> 14:37.612
Just because your sister's good at
violin, doesn't mean you have to be.

14:37.614 --> 14:39.213
Maybe you're talented
at something else.

14:39.215 --> 14:40.314
You think so?

14:40.316 --> 14:41.382
Yeah!

14:41.384 --> 14:42.817
But... like, the flute!

14:42.819 --> 14:44.051
Ooh, or the guitar!

14:44.053 --> 14:46.087
Uh, maybe the clarinet?

14:46.089 --> 14:47.488
Or saxophone?

14:47.490 --> 14:48.789
What about piano?

14:48.791 --> 14:49.595
Or songwriting?

14:49.626 --> 14:52.426
I mean, there's lots of different
ways to express yourself musically.

14:52.428 --> 14:54.695
There's gotta be something
here that she's good at.

14:54.697 --> 14:55.830
Uh...

14:55.832 --> 14:58.633
- Maybe I...
- Um...

14:58.635 --> 14:59.700
Dance.

14:59.702 --> 15:01.369
Or trumpet!

15:03.705 --> 15:07.141
Shelby, you're a
really good dancer!

15:07.143 --> 15:09.143
I don't know.

15:09.145 --> 15:11.445
I just like to dance by myself
in my room when I'm bored.

15:11.447 --> 15:13.681
You have real talent.

15:13.683 --> 15:15.783
You have to dance at
family and friends night.

15:15.785 --> 15:17.251
Really?

15:17.253 --> 15:19.420
Do you think dancing
will impress my sister?

15:19.422 --> 15:21.522
Oh yeah, it will.

15:21.524 --> 15:23.457
Come on, let's see what you got.

15:26.161 --> 15:27.228
I like that move.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.329
Oh, try this one.

15:30.365 --> 15:31.399
Yeah!

15:31.401 --> 15:32.700
How about this?

15:40.609 --> 15:42.443
I can do that. I just...

15:42.445 --> 15:44.178
Haven't stretched.

15:47.549 --> 15:48.503
All right.

15:48.534 --> 15:52.320
Let's shoot the scene where Cecilia
gets caught in the mudslide.

15:52.322 --> 15:55.222
Why don't you go put on your costume,
then I'm gonna cover you in mud.

15:55.224 --> 15:57.558
You know, I was thinking.

15:57.560 --> 16:00.261
Maybe you should play the role
of Cecilia in this scene.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.896
You think?

16:01.898 --> 16:03.864
I mean, I knew I had the
chops for it, but...

16:03.866 --> 16:06.133
waah! Hey!

16:06.135 --> 16:08.569
Aah!

16:11.807 --> 16:16.243
Now, what if after the mudslide,
Cecilia goes to a cereal factory?

16:16.245 --> 16:18.245
I don't know if that's
actually in the script.

16:21.516 --> 16:24.151
And you know what goes
great with cereal?

16:24.153 --> 16:25.186
Milk.

16:25.188 --> 16:26.554
Uh...

16:30.892 --> 16:34.929
I'm starting to get the feeling that
you're upset with me about something.

16:34.931 --> 16:38.199
<i>I was up all night reading
aLonely Maiden's Journey.</i>

16:38.201 --> 16:40.668
None of that stuff you made
me do is in that book!

16:40.670 --> 16:42.203
Oh.

16:42.205 --> 16:43.655
That's what this is all about.

16:43.686 --> 16:46.941
I was just trying to jazz it up
to help you get a good grade.

16:46.943 --> 16:49.310
The real book is boring.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.845
The maiden doesn't
even go on a journey.

16:50.847 --> 16:54.582
It's 300 pages of a woman looking
out a window watching crops die.

16:54.584 --> 16:55.725
Ugh.

16:55.756 --> 17:00.287
Dez, the journey in the book
was clearly a metaphor!

17:00.289 --> 17:02.556
The crops dying symbolized
the death of an ideal life

17:02.558 --> 17:03.924
that may or may not exist.

17:03.926 --> 17:05.726
Oh.

17:05.728 --> 17:08.229
You have no idea what I'm
talking about, do you?

17:08.231 --> 17:10.364
No.

17:10.366 --> 17:12.900
Well, there was a lot of
interesting symbolism in the book,

17:12.902 --> 17:16.837
and... I can't believe
I'm saying this,

17:16.839 --> 17:19.205
but I'm gonna go
write a book report.

17:20.776 --> 17:23.958
So, does that mean we're not gonna
shoot the scene where Cecilia

17:23.989 --> 17:26.946
gets a 20-minute foot massage
from a handsome Italian sailor?

17:26.949 --> 17:28.348
Giovanni!

17:29.284 --> 17:30.518
Oh.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.586
You can go. I'm sorry.

17:45.968 --> 17:47.902
Great job, Charlie!

17:47.904 --> 17:50.571
Whoo!

17:50.573 --> 17:53.874
I want to thank everybody for coming
out to friends and family night.

17:53.876 --> 17:56.544
We have one more special musical
performance this evening...

17:56.546 --> 17:57.912
Shelby Hayden,

17:57.914 --> 18:01.248
with a little help from
our very own Austin moon!

20:27.028 --> 20:28.395
Wow!

20:28.397 --> 20:29.530
That was so amazing!

20:29.532 --> 20:30.631
So cool!

20:34.936 --> 20:35.870
Oh, Shelby.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.607
I've been the most talented person
in this family for my entire life,

20:39.609 --> 20:43.510
and now that I've seen
you dance, I still am,

20:43.512 --> 20:45.079
but I'm happy that
you're a close second.

20:45.081 --> 20:47.781
So, does this mean you liked it?

20:47.783 --> 20:49.049
Liked it?

20:49.051 --> 20:50.117
I loved it!

20:50.119 --> 20:51.619
You're an amazing dancer!

20:51.621 --> 20:54.088
I know. I am pretty amazing.

20:55.824 --> 20:57.958
Thanks, guys. That
was so much fun!

20:57.960 --> 20:59.059
Can we do it again?

20:59.061 --> 21:01.929
You mean right now?

21:01.931 --> 21:03.964
Maybe I'll just watch this time.

21:03.966 --> 21:05.766
I'll take this, buddy.

21:34.996 --> 21:36.630
This pancake is awesome!

21:36.632 --> 21:39.233
This is the greatest thing
anyone has ever done for me,

21:39.235 --> 21:41.201
even though, technically,
I didn't win the bet.

21:41.203 --> 21:43.671
I know, but...

21:43.673 --> 21:45.873
I want to thank you
for believing in me.

21:45.875 --> 21:48.809
And for thinking we can go fart.

21:51.881 --> 21:54.948
I didn't get the joke, but
you said "fart," so...

21:54.950 --> 21:56.183
Aww.

21:58.553 --> 22:00.854
Guess who got an "a"
on her book report.

22:00.856 --> 22:04.258
All I had to do was read the
book, and then report about it.

22:04.260 --> 22:06.093
It was so easy.

22:06.095 --> 22:06.889
Who knew?

22:06.920 --> 22:10.064
Anybody who's ever
done a book report?

22:10.066 --> 22:10.653
Oh, Trish.

22:10.684 --> 22:13.000
I showed our video
to my film class.

22:13.002 --> 22:14.268
They loved your acting!

22:14.270 --> 22:18.706
They want you to star in our next
project, "Attack of the shark-noceros".

22:18.708 --> 22:20.140
No thanks.

22:20.142 --> 22:22.009
I don't want to be
attacked by anything else.

22:22.011 --> 22:25.145
No. You'd be the shark-noceros.

22:25.147 --> 22:26.780
Okay, then I'm in!
