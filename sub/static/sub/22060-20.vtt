WEBVTT

00:08.848 --> 00:09.848
I don't-I don't get it.

00:10.364 --> 00:12.120
Malbaton's doing his time
in Jersey.

00:12.121 --> 00:13.888
If-if he escapes,
ain't it on them?

00:13.890 --> 00:15.689
He crossed the river, numb nuts.

00:15.691 --> 00:17.691
Now he's in the city. He's here?

00:17.693 --> 00:19.193
On the loose?

00:19.195 --> 00:21.528
But hopefully not for long.

00:21.530 --> 00:22.897
That's where you come in.

00:22.899 --> 00:25.633
You see, 35,000
of New York City's finest

00:25.635 --> 00:27.568
do not like the idea
of a cop killer

00:27.570 --> 00:29.336
running loose in the city, so...

00:29.338 --> 00:31.438
you help me find him...

00:33.108 --> 00:35.409
you can hold on to that.

00:35.411 --> 00:38.612
You and I both know Malbaton,
he's no joke.

00:38.614 --> 00:40.547
Jersey, they're lucky they
got him the first time.

00:40.549 --> 00:42.583
You guys are screwed.

00:42.585 --> 00:44.218
Guess that's your way
of telling me

00:44.220 --> 00:46.186
that you can't help me out.

00:46.188 --> 00:47.688
I-I didn't even know
he cut loose.

00:47.690 --> 00:49.256
- Right.
- On my life.

00:49.258 --> 00:50.691
You know,

00:50.693 --> 00:52.259
I think I'm gonna
have to find myself

00:52.261 --> 00:53.794
a new snitch.
Come on, man. Stop.

00:53.796 --> 00:56.230
Don't-don't do me like that,
man. Just come on, just...

00:56.232 --> 00:59.166
This isn't St. Vincent de Paul.

00:59.168 --> 01:02.336
You want to get paid,
you got to deliver the goods.

01:04.539 --> 01:06.774
Come on, man, I am the goods.
Willie's the goods.

01:06.776 --> 01:08.142
Just let me, just let me

01:08.144 --> 01:09.643
hold it down for a second.
I'll get you what you need.

01:09.645 --> 01:12.146
I'll get you anything
you need, all right?

01:12.148 --> 01:13.948
Okay, okay...

01:13.950 --> 01:15.482
No.

01:15.484 --> 01:17.785
Come on, just let me borrow it.

01:23.224 --> 01:24.425
We got nothing.

01:24.427 --> 01:26.226
Coming up on 24 hours.

01:26.228 --> 01:27.661
I know that.

01:27.663 --> 01:28.929
I just mean that...

01:28.931 --> 01:30.664
I... I know what you mean.

01:30.666 --> 01:31.799
The first 24 hours

01:31.801 --> 01:33.500
are most important
on a case like this.

01:33.502 --> 01:35.069
The hell do you want, Talbott?

01:35.071 --> 01:36.270
You don't get your guy
on the first day,

01:36.272 --> 01:37.538
odds are you'll never get him.

01:37.540 --> 01:39.373
- Tell me something I don't know.
- Just trying to help.

01:39.375 --> 01:41.208
We don't need your kind of help.

01:41.210 --> 01:43.310
Even if I told you I could
help you get Malbaton?

01:43.914 --> 01:47.268
You better be careful with
the type of games you play

01:47.269 --> 01:48.733
when it comes to looking
for a cop killer,

01:48.734 --> 01:49.833
you got it?

01:49.835 --> 01:50.834
My client was a former

01:50.836 --> 01:52.770
business associate of Malbaton.

01:52.772 --> 01:54.071
Business associate?

01:54.073 --> 01:56.940
They ran a loan sharking
operation together.

01:56.942 --> 01:58.442
And by client,
you mean the jackass

01:58.444 --> 02:01.945
who delivered a singing telegram
dressed up as a donut

02:01.947 --> 02:03.380
to me here in the squad room?

02:03.382 --> 02:06.750
Victor Lugo has
an eccentric sense of humor.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.151
He's also in jail
doing three years

02:08.154 --> 02:09.720
for breaking a guy's kneecaps
with a crowbar.

02:09.722 --> 02:12.623
Sometimes it takes a bad guy
to catch a bad guy.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.661
I have G One and G Two
for you, sir.

02:17.663 --> 02:19.696
And I made copies.
Thank you, Baker.

02:22.333 --> 02:23.467
You see it?

02:23.469 --> 02:25.202
- Pretty good, right, boss?
- Pretty good?

02:25.204 --> 02:26.970
This is the Yankees
getting Stanton good.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.906
I wouldn't go that far.
Neither would I.

02:28.908 --> 02:30.841
More like the Mets
resigning Bruce good.

02:30.843 --> 02:33.911
"Major crimes down 15%."
That's a ten-year low.

02:33.913 --> 02:36.780
Civilian complaints
also down 18%.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.415
Gee, I must've missed the part

02:38.417 --> 02:42.086
that was underlined, italicized
and highlighted.

02:43.421 --> 02:45.255
Okay, here we go.

02:45.257 --> 02:47.491
What are you gonna pop
the balloon with this time?

02:47.493 --> 02:48.992
What are you talking about?

02:48.994 --> 02:50.427
You got that look on your face.

02:50.429 --> 02:54.098
It is my job to focus
on where we need improvement,

02:54.100 --> 02:56.667
not for doing what we should've
been doing all along.

02:56.669 --> 02:58.068
What's this?

02:58.070 --> 03:01.438
Bureau of Personnel wants
to issue the sergeant's test.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.973
Well, it has been a while.

03:02.975 --> 03:04.108
What, four years?

03:04.110 --> 03:05.776
Six.

03:05.778 --> 03:07.044
We lost quite a few
three-stripes

03:07.046 --> 03:08.445
to retirement, attrition
and promotion.

03:08.447 --> 03:10.280
More sergeants in the mix
would definitely help

03:10.282 --> 03:12.583
the community policing
initiative.

03:12.585 --> 03:14.885
Great optics, too.
No resting on our laurels.

03:14.887 --> 03:16.720
- I like it.
- Me, too.

03:16.722 --> 03:19.957
See, sometimes,
I hardly need to be here.

03:19.959 --> 03:21.758
But you still have to find
a way to pay for it.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.494
- No, I don't.
- Why not?

03:23.496 --> 03:28.098
Hey, have you seen
this great report?

03:30.802 --> 03:32.636
Okay, whenever
you're ready, pal.

03:33.972 --> 03:35.606
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:35.608 --> 03:37.007
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:38.543 --> 03:41.044
You got to be kidding me!

03:41.046 --> 03:43.647
What do you think you're doing?!

03:43.649 --> 03:44.815
Are you kidding me?

03:44.817 --> 03:47.451
Get back here!
Get your ass back here!

03:54.425 --> 03:57.294
Well, if it isn't
my favorite "defective."

03:59.732 --> 04:03.266
All right. All right.

04:03.268 --> 04:05.235
I'll shut up.

04:07.172 --> 04:09.439
You got 60 seconds
to make your case, Lugo.

04:09.441 --> 04:11.441
Start talking.

04:11.443 --> 04:13.410
I used to run with Malbaton.

04:13.412 --> 04:15.445
I know his moves, how he thinks.

04:15.447 --> 04:17.547
I know every little trick
he's got up his sleeve.

04:17.548 --> 04:20.384
I'm not here to audition you two
lovebirds for The Newlywed Game.

04:20.386 --> 04:22.519
I just need to know
where the hell he is.

04:22.521 --> 04:24.087
I know where he hangs out.

04:24.089 --> 04:26.590
I know where he hangs out when
he don't want nobody knowing

04:26.592 --> 04:28.058
where he's hanging out.
I'm telling you,

04:28.060 --> 04:30.327
I can deliver this guy.
Great, then, where is he?

04:30.329 --> 04:33.697
Whoa. First, we got to work out
what's in it for Lugo.

04:33.699 --> 04:34.998
Besides the warm fuzzy
feeling you'll get

04:35.000 --> 04:36.566
knowing you got a cop killer
off the street?

04:36.568 --> 04:39.469
I ain't dropping dime
for a Boy Scout merit badge.

04:39.471 --> 04:41.271
You got to let me roll with you.

04:41.273 --> 04:43.607
What's that? You say they
let you do drugs in prison?

04:43.609 --> 04:45.575
It's a deal breaker, Reagan.
You want me to be a bloodhound,

04:45.577 --> 04:47.344
you got to put me
on the street with you.

04:47.346 --> 04:48.745
Not happening. Forget about it.

04:48.747 --> 04:52.149
Then give my condolences to the
family of the next cop he kills,

04:52.151 --> 04:55.085
'cause you and me both know
it's only a matter of time.

04:55.087 --> 04:56.486
CO on the gate.

04:56.488 --> 04:59.890
You don't "CO on the gate" me.
I "CO on the gate" you.

04:59.892 --> 05:02.025
CO on the gate.

05:02.027 --> 05:04.194
Yes, sir.

05:07.532 --> 05:09.800
Come on, Reagan, give me a shot.

05:12.603 --> 05:16.139
All right, Lugo, but you're
gonna be on a very tight leash.

05:16.141 --> 05:16.855
You got my word.

05:16.879 --> 05:19.785
Which means nothing.
Get changed.

05:21.415 --> 05:23.847
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

05:26.452 --> 05:28.752
I said get changed.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:01.715 --> 06:04.049
I should've pulled
him out by his ear

06:04.051 --> 06:06.351
and washed my windshield
with his face.

06:06.353 --> 06:09.821
Okay, buddy. Thanks for
looking into it for me.

06:09.823 --> 06:11.156
Sorry about that.

06:11.158 --> 06:13.124
It's okay. I like hearing
about your hot dates.

06:13.126 --> 06:14.225
Ha, ha, ha.

06:14.227 --> 06:16.194
So funny I forgot to laugh.

06:16.196 --> 06:18.663
Ooh, I don't know how to compete
with that snappy comeback.

06:18.665 --> 06:20.899
Maybe... "I know you are,
but what am I"?

06:20.901 --> 06:22.233
Can you give me a break?

06:22.235 --> 06:24.602
Some dirtbag slammed
into my car this morning,

06:24.604 --> 06:25.904
smashed my front bumper.

06:25.906 --> 06:27.005
I'm sorry to hear that.

06:27.007 --> 06:28.239
But look at the bright side,

06:28.241 --> 06:30.608
the scratch is on the car
and not on you.

06:30.610 --> 06:32.410
That car is important
to me, Erin.

06:32.412 --> 06:33.878
- It is?
- Very.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.815
And now it's smashed
because some jerk was too busy

06:36.817 --> 06:38.416
playing kissy-poo
with some tomato

06:38.418 --> 06:42.087
instead of paying attention
to where the hell he was going.

06:42.089 --> 06:44.255
Kissy-poo with some tomato?

06:44.257 --> 06:45.924
The driver was making out
with his girlfriend

06:45.926 --> 06:47.959
while he was backing out
of a parking spot.

06:47.961 --> 06:49.160
Well, thank you.

06:49.162 --> 06:52.263
I left my "English to Brooklyn
dictionary" at home.

06:52.265 --> 06:53.531
Wow, you're just a boat

06:53.533 --> 06:54.958
full of one-liners today,
aren't you, Erin?

06:54.959 --> 06:56.589
Well, I'm in a good
mood, so sue me.

06:56.613 --> 06:57.837
A real good mood.

06:57.838 --> 07:00.138
Not sure I ever saw
this side of you before.

07:00.140 --> 07:01.339
What's wrong? Fever?

07:01.341 --> 07:02.540
- Ha-ha.
- You can give it,

07:02.542 --> 07:03.842
but you can't take it?

07:03.844 --> 07:05.376
I can take it just fine.

07:05.378 --> 07:08.446
Okay, what's going on?

07:08.448 --> 07:10.949
Nothing. I woke up this way.

07:22.229 --> 07:25.497
Right, Erin.
And I'm a swimsuit model.

07:35.908 --> 07:37.542
Nice group.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.044
Had a great teacher.

07:42.715 --> 07:46.217
Why do you still carry
that old Fitz Special, Dad?

07:46.219 --> 07:47.685
Carried it all my life.

07:47.687 --> 07:49.487
In uniform as a backup,

07:49.489 --> 07:51.623
and now as my primary.

07:51.625 --> 07:53.158
Modern compact auto
would give you

07:53.160 --> 07:54.526
more firepower,
about the same size.

07:54.528 --> 07:56.694
A tight group like you shot
is good for paper,

07:56.696 --> 07:59.364
but self-defense? Not so much.

07:59.366 --> 08:00.598
I know the difference.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.700
I know you know.

08:04.170 --> 08:06.371
Look, I'm sentimental,

08:06.373 --> 08:09.207
it being Pop's
and his pop before him.

08:09.209 --> 08:10.975
Besides...

08:10.977 --> 08:13.845
I have a security detail.

08:13.847 --> 08:16.047
Can I hold it?

08:16.049 --> 08:18.817
You can.

08:24.690 --> 08:27.625
It's good to go.

08:56.822 --> 08:58.790
Great action.

08:58.792 --> 09:02.060
Easy access.
Maybe someday it'll be yours.

09:02.062 --> 09:03.928
But not yet.

09:05.698 --> 09:07.765
Thanks for the invite today,
Dad.

09:07.767 --> 09:09.367
I love this place.

09:09.369 --> 09:11.536
Remember how old you were
the first time you came here?

09:11.538 --> 09:12.837
It was my eighth birthday.

09:12.839 --> 09:14.038
That's exactly right.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.440
Place hasn't changed a bit.

09:15.442 --> 09:18.209
Well, best put our money out
on the street, don't you think?

09:18.211 --> 09:20.378
Mom used to get kind of upset
when you'd take me here.

09:20.380 --> 09:21.412
I'm afraid your mom

09:21.414 --> 09:24.349
had law school on her mind
from the get-go.

09:24.351 --> 09:25.416
Something tells me

09:25.418 --> 09:27.485
you always knew
I'd wind up in the bag.

09:27.487 --> 09:29.621
Some believe our path
is already written,

09:29.623 --> 09:31.789
that life reveals itself to us.

09:31.791 --> 09:34.092
I believe we make our own way

09:34.094 --> 09:36.294
with our own choices.

09:38.797 --> 09:42.300
Thanks for spending some time
with your old man.

09:42.302 --> 09:44.502
Yeah.

10:00.619 --> 10:03.121
Sure you don't want a slice?

10:03.123 --> 10:04.455
Best pie in Manhattan.

10:04.457 --> 10:05.723
I'm good with mine.

10:05.725 --> 10:08.092
I just found out about kale
about a year ago.

10:08.094 --> 10:09.961
And now they're
putting it on pizza?

10:09.963 --> 10:11.863
The hell is that all about?

10:11.865 --> 10:13.898
Excuse me.

10:14.733 --> 10:16.634
Hey, Al.

10:16.636 --> 10:19.537
Right, right, yeah.
Okay, well, thanks

10:19.539 --> 10:20.805
for trying.

10:20.807 --> 10:23.107
Let me know
if something comes up.

10:23.109 --> 10:24.042
The Benedetto case?

10:24.044 --> 10:25.243
My fender bender.

10:25.245 --> 10:26.311
You're not seriously

10:26.313 --> 10:27.545
still going on about that.

10:27.547 --> 10:30.448
I told you, that car
is very important to me, Erin.

10:30.450 --> 10:32.650
Anthony, an '84 Cutlass
is not important to anybody.

10:32.652 --> 10:35.119
Well, it is to me.
Besides, it's the principle.

10:35.121 --> 10:36.087
What principle?

10:36.089 --> 10:37.555
Thou shall not
get in a fender bender

10:37.557 --> 10:39.190
with Anthony ABETEMARCO?

10:39.192 --> 10:41.092
It's leaving the scene
of an accident.

10:41.094 --> 10:43.828
It's not exactly the crime
of the century.

10:43.830 --> 10:45.596
Want some advice?

10:45.598 --> 10:46.798
No.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.800
Down that slice and forget it.

10:48.802 --> 10:50.568
There's one thing I've learned
in this life.

10:50.570 --> 10:53.137
You got to let go
of past slights.

10:53.139 --> 10:54.939
Life is too short.

10:54.941 --> 10:56.941
Yeah, yeah.

10:59.778 --> 11:01.145
Can I tell you a secret?

11:01.147 --> 11:03.381
I'd rather you didn't.

11:03.383 --> 11:05.283
I have a date.

11:05.285 --> 11:06.484
That's nice.

11:06.486 --> 11:08.186
I hope you have
a wonderful time.

11:08.188 --> 11:09.787
With my ex-husband.

11:10.689 --> 11:11.756
What are you doing?

11:11.758 --> 11:13.524
Begging you to stop talking
about this.

11:13.526 --> 11:14.197
Why?

11:14.221 --> 11:16.221
'Cause no good could come
of me knowing about this.

11:16.262 --> 11:17.261
La, la, la, la

11:17.263 --> 11:19.030
la, la, la, la, la, la.
Okay, stop.

11:19.032 --> 11:21.065
La, la, la, la. La.
That's not funny.

11:21.067 --> 11:23.001
La, la.

11:23.003 --> 11:25.536
Why are you acting like this?

11:25.538 --> 11:26.871
I told you.

11:26.873 --> 11:29.774
I'd rather not talk
about this subject.

11:29.776 --> 11:33.444
It's okay
if you don't like Jack.

11:33.446 --> 11:35.813
A lot of people don't,
including my entire family.

11:35.815 --> 11:37.482
And, for the better part

11:37.484 --> 11:39.183
of the past eight years, me.

11:39.185 --> 11:40.685
So if you don't like him,

11:40.687 --> 11:41.819
just say you don't like him.

11:41.821 --> 11:43.988
Okay. I don't like him.

11:48.927 --> 11:51.129
Wow.

11:52.931 --> 11:54.432
Nice friend.

11:54.434 --> 11:55.500
Come on.

11:55.502 --> 11:59.203
You said... you got
to be kidding me, Erin.

11:59.205 --> 12:01.606
You set me up.

12:08.647 --> 12:10.815
You're sure this Malbaton's
girlfriend's place?

12:10.817 --> 12:12.417
No doubt. This is Molly's joint.

12:12.419 --> 12:14.652
And this is definitely her?
Molly Chavez?

12:14.654 --> 12:16.220
My word is bond.

12:16.222 --> 12:17.455
Your word means crap to me

12:17.457 --> 12:19.123
and there's no names
on the directory,

12:19.125 --> 12:20.525
so you better be sure.
A thousand percent.

12:20.527 --> 12:21.559
That's her. That's her place.

12:21.561 --> 12:22.660
You better put this on.

12:22.662 --> 12:23.795
If Malbaton's up there with her,

12:23.797 --> 12:25.196
it could get pretty hairy.

12:25.198 --> 12:26.264
Yeah. Good looking out.

12:26.266 --> 12:28.199
Give me your hand. Come on.

12:28.201 --> 12:29.467
What the hell is this?

12:29.469 --> 12:31.803
In case you get any stupid ideas
about trying to run.

12:31.805 --> 12:32.804
At least leave me a phone
or something.

12:32.806 --> 12:34.072
I can play some Candy Crush.

12:34.074 --> 12:36.107
Hey. Keep your eyes open

12:36.109 --> 12:37.375
'cause I would really hate
for you

12:37.377 --> 12:38.709
to get hit by a stray bullet.
Just gonna leave me here?

12:38.711 --> 12:40.278
What am I supposed to do?

12:40.280 --> 12:41.979
Let's go.

12:41.981 --> 12:44.215
Right inside.
We're gonna head left.

12:50.355 --> 12:54.058
Okay. On one, two, three.

12:55.194 --> 12:56.394
Go, go, go!

12:56.396 --> 12:57.728
Police!

12:57.730 --> 12:59.664
Let me see your hands!

13:01.166 --> 13:02.333
Please, no.

13:06.839 --> 13:08.473
- Anybody else here?
- No, no.

13:08.475 --> 13:09.807
- Nobody.
- Nobody else?

13:09.809 --> 13:11.042
What about Molly Chavez?
Where is she?

13:11.044 --> 13:12.777
Who is Molly Chavez?

13:12.779 --> 13:14.445
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

13:15.481 --> 13:16.714
Do you have any ID on you, sir?

13:16.716 --> 13:17.949
It's okay.

13:17.951 --> 13:20.585
It's okay.

13:20.587 --> 13:25.022
"Krishna Chopra. 116
Elgin. Apartment 2B."

13:26.592 --> 13:28.326
All clear.

13:28.328 --> 13:29.660
Figured as much.

13:29.662 --> 13:31.629
Our apologies, folks.

13:31.631 --> 13:33.231
Okay? Go back to your dinner.

13:33.233 --> 13:35.199
I'm sorry.

13:37.870 --> 13:40.071
Maybe Lugo gave us
the wrong apartment.

13:40.073 --> 13:42.306
Yeah. Maybe he just
lied to us on purpose.

13:42.308 --> 13:44.475
It's okay, everyone.
Go back to your apartments.

13:44.477 --> 13:46.377
Everything's und...

13:46.379 --> 13:48.379
Miss?

13:49.515 --> 13:50.715
Hey!

13:50.717 --> 13:51.916
That could be our girl.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.218
Hey! Hey!

13:54.220 --> 13:57.588
Hey!

14:02.861 --> 14:03.995
Hey!

14:03.997 --> 14:05.663
Police!

14:14.139 --> 14:17.208
Hold it!

14:17.210 --> 14:18.476
Hey! Police!

14:18.478 --> 14:20.478
Hold it!

14:20.480 --> 14:21.812
Hey!

14:21.814 --> 14:23.581
Police!

14:32.457 --> 14:33.724
Hold it!

14:35.561 --> 14:37.094
Get the hell out of the way.

14:57.633 --> 15:00.435
2F. 2F. Hey! Not 2B.

15:00.437 --> 15:02.303
It was 2F.

15:02.305 --> 15:03.671
Get out.

15:03.673 --> 15:05.173
Why the hell did you give me
the wrong apartment number?

15:05.175 --> 15:06.941
So I was off by a couple
of apartments.

15:06.943 --> 15:08.776
- It was an honest mistake.
- An honest mistake

15:08.778 --> 15:10.011
that helped our girl get away.

15:10.013 --> 15:11.513
Look, I'm sorry.

15:11.515 --> 15:13.556
I thought I had it right.
My bad.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.884
I think you're screwing with us.

15:14.885 --> 15:15.917
You're screwing with
us to try to make us

15:15.919 --> 15:17.218
look like a bunch of idiots

15:17.220 --> 15:19.053
like you did with
the damn donuts.

15:19.055 --> 15:20.321
What'd you say?

15:20.323 --> 15:21.489
I said nothing.

15:21.491 --> 15:23.191
But you were thinking
about saying something.

15:23.193 --> 15:24.325
Okay. That's enough.

15:24.327 --> 15:25.560
We're never gonna get
anywhere like this.

15:25.562 --> 15:27.428
We need to work
on our next move.

15:27.430 --> 15:30.031
That was our move
and he blew it.

15:30.033 --> 15:32.400
It's not our only move.

15:32.402 --> 15:33.701
Who you calling?

15:33.703 --> 15:37.605
Real Time Crime Center,
Detective Baez, 5-4 Squad.

15:37.607 --> 15:39.974
We're looking
for a Hispanic female.

15:39.976 --> 15:42.010
Just took the N train
out of Ditmars Station.

15:42.012 --> 15:43.878
Texting you a photo
of the suspect now.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.180
Tracking her moves. Good idea.

15:46.182 --> 15:47.215
You're not the only one

15:47.217 --> 15:48.683
with a gold shield
around here, you know.

15:48.685 --> 15:51.586
Fair enough.

15:51.588 --> 15:53.354
Shut up.

15:53.356 --> 15:54.856
Shut... shut up.

15:54.858 --> 15:56.024
Get in the car.

15:56.026 --> 15:57.725
- Watch the head.
- Shut up.

16:02.464 --> 16:03.965
I come bearing gifts.

16:03.967 --> 16:06.100
You come bearing carbs.

16:06.102 --> 16:07.635
It's a peace offer.

16:08.971 --> 16:11.873
Look, I'm a knucklehead,

16:11.875 --> 16:13.508
a knucklehead who

16:13.510 --> 16:16.244
puts his foot in his mouth
a hundred times a week,

16:16.246 --> 16:19.614
which is why I prefer
to just keep my yap shut.

16:19.616 --> 16:21.716
No, Anthony, I pushed you.

16:21.718 --> 16:23.084
Doesn't matter.

16:23.086 --> 16:25.019
It's my job as your friend
to be supportive

16:25.021 --> 16:26.854
of whatever you got going on

16:26.856 --> 16:30.725
and not to offer
my dumb-ass opinions.

16:30.727 --> 16:32.627
Your opinions are not dumb.

16:32.629 --> 16:35.096
In fact,
they're usually on point,

16:35.098 --> 16:39.801
which is why I got so mad when
you said you didn't like Jack.

16:39.803 --> 16:41.436
I never said I didn't like him.

16:42.471 --> 16:43.805
I don't know the guy.

16:43.807 --> 16:45.073
Just what you've told me.

16:45.075 --> 16:46.307
I hear what you're saying,

16:46.309 --> 16:50.378
but he's also a really
good person deep down.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.013
I wouldn't have married him
if he wasn't.

16:52.015 --> 16:53.715
Now that I believe.

16:53.717 --> 16:55.950
So what's the statue
of limitations

16:55.952 --> 16:57.185
on something like this?

16:57.187 --> 16:58.553
Statute.

16:58.555 --> 17:01.322
Statute of limitations,
not statue.

17:01.324 --> 17:03.725
What are you talking about?

17:03.727 --> 17:05.226
It's two different words.

17:05.228 --> 17:06.493
"Statute" is a law

17:06.496 --> 17:09.196
and "statue" is
a big, giant sculpture-y thing.

17:09.199 --> 17:12.000
Whatever. Point is,
do you forgive me?

17:12.002 --> 17:13.468
Of course I do.

17:13.470 --> 17:15.403
Then my work here is done.

17:15.405 --> 17:16.371
Don't you want to know

17:16.373 --> 17:17.704
what we're doing on our date?

17:17.707 --> 17:19.473
Sure. What do you got planned?

17:19.476 --> 17:20.708
Well, it's a day date.

17:20.710 --> 17:24.112
And we're taking his boat
out past Ellis Island

17:24.114 --> 17:26.881
and he's arranged
for a private tour

17:26.883 --> 17:29.584
of the Statue of Limitations.

17:30.644 --> 17:33.545
Up yours, Reagan.

17:33.547 --> 17:37.415
I love you, too, Anthony.

18:01.841 --> 18:03.842
So, did you give it to him?

18:03.844 --> 18:08.313
Yeah, I gave it to him.

18:08.315 --> 18:09.848
What'd he say?

18:11.784 --> 18:14.018
He didn't say anything.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.854
Nothing?

18:15.856 --> 18:18.623
Nope.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.792
Well, what did you say?

18:24.130 --> 18:25.964
You chickened out.

18:25.966 --> 18:29.534
Not exactly.

18:29.536 --> 18:33.004
Yeah, you did.

18:33.006 --> 18:36.708
Look, Pop, I'm proud that
he wants to be on the street.

18:36.710 --> 18:39.244
But the sergeant still
wears the uniform.

18:39.246 --> 18:40.512
He still works the streets.

18:40.514 --> 18:42.647
Yeah, and gets called a boss.
So?

18:42.649 --> 18:44.749
Well, somehow,
I don't think Jamie

18:44.751 --> 18:46.751
wants to see himself that way.

18:46.753 --> 18:48.520
But you do.

18:49.722 --> 18:51.089
I know I do.

18:51.091 --> 18:55.860
Yeah, well, I kind of
made a promise to myself

18:55.862 --> 18:58.363
that I wouldn't push it.

18:58.365 --> 19:01.666
But if he doesn't at
least get on the list

19:01.668 --> 19:03.635
and then changes his mind...

19:03.637 --> 19:06.437
It would be too late.

19:06.439 --> 19:08.640
Yeah.

19:19.852 --> 19:22.787
You're trying to tell me that
you guys got so many cameras

19:22.789 --> 19:26.124
all over the city that you can
track somebody wherever they go?

19:26.126 --> 19:27.659
Big Brother's always watching.

19:27.661 --> 19:28.827
Who?

19:28.829 --> 19:31.596
Big... geez, read a book
or something, will you?

19:31.598 --> 19:33.865
You mean like on that TV show

19:33.867 --> 19:35.300
with all the cameras.

19:35.302 --> 19:36.668
Kind of.

19:39.505 --> 19:41.506
So how does it work?

19:41.508 --> 19:44.275
That photo I sent,

19:44.277 --> 19:46.647
it gets run through
facial recognition software.

19:46.648 --> 19:48.415
Once the computer knows
what it's looking for,

19:48.417 --> 19:51.752
then it searches every camera in
the city until it finds a match.

19:51.754 --> 19:53.286
Then once it finds a match

19:53.288 --> 19:54.588
it keeps tabs
on that individual.

19:54.590 --> 19:56.857
And you guys got a hit on Molly?
Yeah.

19:56.859 --> 19:59.493
It dinged her going into the
14th Street subway station.

19:59.495 --> 20:01.495
Yeah, followed her
uptown to 34th

20:01.497 --> 20:04.031
where she transferred trains,
then downtown on the 1.

20:04.033 --> 20:06.800
She got off at Franklin
where she got into a cab.

20:06.802 --> 20:09.870
Cab number 8-6-Zebra-5.

20:09.872 --> 20:12.639
Damn, you know what cab
she got into?

20:12.641 --> 20:13.907
Yeah. It's just ahead there.

20:13.909 --> 20:15.142
You guys got her already?

20:15.144 --> 20:17.844
Yup. You might want
to keep that in mind

20:17.846 --> 20:19.079
next time you decide to beat
somebody with a crowbar,

20:19.081 --> 20:21.281
tough guy.

20:21.283 --> 20:22.883
Sit tight.

20:33.961 --> 20:35.262
Well, well, well.

20:35.264 --> 20:37.964
Nice to see you again,
Molly Chavez.

20:39.801 --> 20:41.234
You're trying to tell me

20:41.236 --> 20:43.703
that Dereck Malbaton, cop killer

20:43.705 --> 20:46.039
and escaped convict
is slinging Jordans

20:46.041 --> 20:47.774
at a Foot Locker in Astoria?

20:47.776 --> 20:49.676
Well, I didn't say all that.

20:49.678 --> 20:50.844
I get it.

20:50.846 --> 20:53.513
You're trying to sell me
some story that,

20:53.515 --> 20:56.783
you dumped Malbaton and now
it's your new boyfriend,

20:56.785 --> 20:59.586
some regular Joe Jock Strap,
who works at Foot Locker.

20:59.588 --> 21:01.021
It's no story.

21:01.023 --> 21:02.255
It's just not
a believable story,

21:02.257 --> 21:04.124
'cause you and I both know
that if you did

21:04.126 --> 21:06.059
break up with Malbaton,
we'd be pulling your corpse

21:06.061 --> 21:07.828
out of a Dumpster
in Chinatown right now.

21:09.530 --> 21:11.631
Okay. All right, fine.

21:11.633 --> 21:13.800
Maybe I didn't break up
with him.

21:13.802 --> 21:16.703
And yeah, I know he busted out
of jail, but I haven't seen him.

21:16.705 --> 21:17.771
Has he called you?

21:17.773 --> 21:19.239
No.

21:19.241 --> 21:21.775
He hasn't tried to get
in contact with you at all?

21:21.777 --> 21:23.043
None.

21:23.045 --> 21:24.111
Okay.

21:24.113 --> 21:25.345
You do realize that
if I get a warrant

21:25.347 --> 21:26.279
to search your phone

21:26.281 --> 21:28.615
and I dump it and
find out you have been

21:28.617 --> 21:29.850
communicating with him,

21:29.852 --> 21:30.917
that is aiding
and abetting, right?

21:30.919 --> 21:33.520
You don't need a warrant.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.623
You can have it.

21:51.539 --> 21:53.006
What the hell is
going on here, Lugo?

21:53.008 --> 21:54.307
She's lying.

21:54.309 --> 21:57.144
She gave me her cell phone,
which means it's clean.

21:57.146 --> 21:58.845
Wouldn't be the first broad
I know had two mobiles.

21:58.847 --> 21:59.980
That's not the problem.

21:59.982 --> 22:02.082
The problem is
she's not even nervous.

22:02.084 --> 22:03.717
'Cause she's a pro, man.

22:03.719 --> 22:06.653
You don't get to be Malbaton's
dime piece being a rookie.

22:06.655 --> 22:09.189
I'm telling you, the two of
them, they're Bonnie and Clyde.

22:09.191 --> 22:11.191
You got to give me something.
Give you what?

22:11.193 --> 22:12.359
Something to make her talk.

22:12.361 --> 22:14.294
I don't know how
to make her talk.

22:14.296 --> 22:15.328
That's your job.

22:15.330 --> 22:17.797
Well, then what the hell
do we have you here for?

22:17.799 --> 22:19.299
Get on your feet, jackass.

22:19.301 --> 22:20.734
- Come on, you're going back to the joint.
- No, no, no.

22:20.736 --> 22:23.336
Come on, come on, man. No.
Recess is over.

22:23.338 --> 22:24.971
Wait. I got something.

22:24.973 --> 22:26.139
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

22:26.141 --> 22:27.941
I got something
that'll make her talk.

22:42.619 --> 22:45.519
It was clean,
just like you said.

22:45.521 --> 22:47.655
- Told you.
- You're right.

22:47.657 --> 22:48.990
I apologize.

22:50.727 --> 22:53.361
I have an address
written down here.

22:53.363 --> 22:57.031
Was wondering if,
by any chance, it...

22:57.033 --> 22:59.200
might ring a bell for you.

23:05.274 --> 23:07.208
Where did you get this?

23:07.210 --> 23:09.076
Saint Michael.

23:09.078 --> 23:10.478
Patron saint of cops.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.914
He whispers clues in my ear
every now and again.

23:13.916 --> 23:16.117
Nobody knows this address.

23:16.119 --> 23:17.685
Nobody but me, you,

23:17.687 --> 23:20.488
Saint Michael
and maybe Dereck Malbaton.

23:20.490 --> 23:22.456
Is that where he's hiding out?

23:22.458 --> 23:25.793
Absolutely not.
Come on, no way, man.

23:25.795 --> 23:27.928
Why not?

23:27.930 --> 23:30.031
You said yourself
nobody knows this address.

23:30.033 --> 23:34.902
I mean, seems like a good place
for him to lay low.

23:34.904 --> 23:38.172
You think I'm going to let
the most wanted man in the city

23:38.174 --> 23:40.174
hide out at my mother's house?

23:40.176 --> 23:41.375
Why not?

23:41.377 --> 23:44.045
After all, he's
been paying the rent for her

23:44.047 --> 23:45.212
for the last three years,

23:45.214 --> 23:47.515
ever since she
moved into the place.

23:48.374 --> 23:51.208
Saint Michael told me that, too.

23:54.445 --> 23:55.746
So what?

23:55.748 --> 23:57.347
So he pays her rent.

23:57.349 --> 23:59.983
Still doesn't mean that
I would let him stay there.

23:59.985 --> 24:03.053
I would never put my mother
in harm's way like that.

24:03.055 --> 24:05.522
'Cause you're very protective
of your mother.

24:05.524 --> 24:08.225
Is that because she's here
illegally?

24:09.761 --> 24:14.031
I swear to you,
he's not at my mother's house.

24:14.033 --> 24:15.299
Yeah, I believe you.

24:15.301 --> 24:18.068
But it's best to be
a hundred percent sure.

24:18.070 --> 24:20.370
ESU units are on their way
to your mom's place.

24:20.372 --> 24:22.372
They will want to ask
your mom some questions,

24:22.374 --> 24:24.441
at which point they
will probably discover

24:24.443 --> 24:26.543
that Malbaton
has been paying her rent,

24:26.545 --> 24:27.916
at which point they
will have no choice

24:27.917 --> 24:29.115
but to turn her over to ICE.

24:29.139 --> 24:30.636
Wait, you're gonna deport
my mother?

24:30.637 --> 24:33.071
I'm not gonna deport anyone...
But those guys from ICE,

24:33.073 --> 24:36.174
well... there's a new sheriff
calling the shots for them,

24:36.176 --> 24:38.211
and they're not as forgiving
as they used to be.

24:38.235 --> 24:39.445
Okay, fine!

24:39.446 --> 24:41.846
Fine.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.648
You win.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.117
What do I win?

24:46.119 --> 24:48.886
I'll tell you
where Malbaton is hiding.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.154
Good.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.757
And I'll call off ESU.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.461
Now start talking.

25:02.134 --> 25:05.770
Hi there. Looking for Anthony...

25:05.772 --> 25:07.638
Ablete...

25:08.775 --> 25:10.374
Anthony ABETEMARCO.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.677
Right. Pleased to meet you.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.679
We've met.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.581
Right. At the...

25:16.583 --> 25:18.015
Doesn't matter.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.351
Yeah. I received a message

25:20.353 --> 25:22.253
that you have some
new information

25:22.255 --> 25:23.221
on my Bronfman case.

25:23.223 --> 25:24.422
Yeah.

25:24.424 --> 25:25.857
No.

25:25.859 --> 25:27.925
Yeah, no?

25:27.927 --> 25:30.128
That was just to
get you down here.

25:30.130 --> 25:31.462
I'm sorry?

25:32.731 --> 25:35.666
I just wanted to give you this.

25:35.668 --> 25:36.701
I'm sorry,

25:36.703 --> 25:38.269
what-what exactly
is going on here?

25:38.271 --> 25:40.238
That there is a receipt
from my mechanic.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.507
$1,500 to fix my front end.

25:42.509 --> 25:44.475
Right, and you're giving it
to me, because...?

25:44.477 --> 25:46.444
- You're the clown that backed into me.
- Okay,

25:46.446 --> 25:47.812
easy.

25:47.814 --> 25:50.848
I, think there must have
been some kind of mistake here.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.618
Is your license plate CTT 7723?

25:53.620 --> 25:56.020
- Yeah. I think so.
- No, I know so.

25:56.022 --> 25:57.955
And there's no mistake.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.657
You backed the ass of your Benz

25:59.659 --> 26:01.592
into the front teeth
of my Cutlass.

26:01.594 --> 26:04.195
But that's not why
I got you down here.

26:04.197 --> 26:06.497
How about you tell me
why you got me down here?

26:06.499 --> 26:08.633
To tell you to stay the
hell away from Erin.

26:08.635 --> 26:11.169
All right,
how about you back up?

26:11.171 --> 26:13.137
No, you back up.
And I'm not screwing around.

26:13.139 --> 26:15.473
I've known
a lot of women in my day,

26:15.475 --> 26:17.942
but there's no one
in the world like her.

26:17.944 --> 26:20.178
You better believe
I'm gonna make damn sure

26:20.180 --> 26:23.347
she gets treated like
the one-of-a-kind that she is.

26:23.349 --> 26:26.551
Yeah. Couldn't agree more
on how special Erin is.

26:26.553 --> 26:30.521
But again, how about you tell me
why I'm down here?

26:30.523 --> 26:32.690
I saw you behind the wheel
of that car,

26:32.692 --> 26:35.359
and I saw what you were doing
with that tomato.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.028
I'm sorry, toma-tah?

26:37.030 --> 26:38.596
Don't play cute with me.

26:38.598 --> 26:41.065
And don't you dare play
with Erin's emotions.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.836
You could go now.

26:57.250 --> 26:58.850
Sir, she's here.

27:01.019 --> 27:03.020
And thank you.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.360
Welcome.

27:09.362 --> 27:12.230
No, hey. You don't have
to do any of that.

27:16.969 --> 27:20.171
Sorry. Please, sit down.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.775
Yes, sir.

27:29.848 --> 27:32.049
Thanks for coming up.

27:32.918 --> 27:34.552
I apologize for the...

27:34.554 --> 27:35.653
the uniform.

27:35.655 --> 27:37.321
I didn't know
that I was coming...

27:37.323 --> 27:39.824
Hey, I didn't even know you
were gonna be in the building

27:39.826 --> 27:43.027
until Detective Baker saw it
on the visitors list, so...

27:43.896 --> 27:45.529
How's the rib?

27:45.531 --> 27:47.431
All good, sir, thank you.

27:47.433 --> 27:48.833
Just don't make you laugh?

27:48.835 --> 27:50.034
I would appreciate that.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.303
What brings you to One PP?

27:52.305 --> 27:54.171
My girlfriend from the academy

27:54.173 --> 27:56.340
got transferred to Operations,

27:56.342 --> 27:58.409
so I'm taking her out
to lunch to celebrate.

27:58.411 --> 28:01.712
Well, congratulations to your
girlfriend in Operations.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.617
- I was gonna thank you...
- Can I...

28:09.154 --> 28:10.788
You first.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.791
I just was gonna thank you for
putting up the sergeant's exam.

28:15.561 --> 28:17.728
You're gonna take the test.

28:17.730 --> 28:19.397
I'm not sure where I'm headed,

28:19.399 --> 28:21.832
but I figured
I should get in line.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.135
There you go.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.939
Can I ask you something?

28:27.941 --> 28:29.607
Of course, Commissioner.

28:31.009 --> 28:34.478
Do you know if your partner's
gonna take the test?

28:38.116 --> 28:41.485
Well, you know my partner.

28:41.487 --> 28:44.555
Likes to keep things close
to the vest and all that.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.357
Yes.

28:51.997 --> 28:55.266
The truth is, if I knew
the answer to your question

28:55.268 --> 28:57.034
and I shared it with you,

28:57.036 --> 29:01.339
that would violate the trust
my partner put in me.

29:01.341 --> 29:03.140
Of course.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.376
I get it.

29:05.378 --> 29:07.611
Sorry for overstepping.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.647
Not at all.

29:10.649 --> 29:13.417
Well, look, enjoy your lunch.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.186
Thanks for coming.

29:16.689 --> 29:19.190
And you don't have to salute.

29:21.026 --> 29:22.593
Thanks.

29:24.129 --> 29:26.297
Commissioner,
I don't think that my partner's

29:26.299 --> 29:27.865
gonna take the test.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.502
Why is that?

29:31.504 --> 29:34.805
Because he gave me
his application.

29:58.730 --> 30:02.199
Molly says Malbaton's holed up
on the second floor.

30:03.068 --> 30:04.502
ESU's ready.

30:05.937 --> 30:08.272
Yeah, I know the drill.

30:09.374 --> 30:10.708
Hey, how about my phone
this time?

30:10.710 --> 30:13.652
Take your stupid phone.
Enjoy your video games.

30:13.653 --> 30:14.233
Thanks.

30:14.257 --> 30:15.799
Don't try anything stupid, okay?

30:15.800 --> 30:18.801
There's a hundred cops on
this block, you got it?

30:19.770 --> 30:21.170
I got it.

30:30.213 --> 30:33.549
Let's be extra careful...
This guy's a bad guy.

30:33.551 --> 30:35.718
Next hallway up.

30:45.562 --> 30:47.263
No.

30:53.637 --> 30:55.337
Go.

30:56.106 --> 30:57.239
Damn it.

31:01.679 --> 31:04.680
No, no, no, no, no, no,

31:04.682 --> 31:06.515
no, no, no.

31:21.232 --> 31:23.432
One...

31:23.434 --> 31:25.034
two...

31:25.036 --> 31:27.436
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

31:46.156 --> 31:47.957
It's okay.

31:55.639 --> 31:57.206
What's the matter with you?

31:57.208 --> 31:58.574
Get your hands off me.

32:00.166 --> 32:01.365
How'd you know?

32:01.367 --> 32:02.491
What are you talking about?
You texted me

32:02.492 --> 32:03.891
one second before
that apartment blew.

32:03.893 --> 32:05.326
How the hell did you know?

32:05.328 --> 32:06.961
What's the matter with you?
I saved your life.

32:06.963 --> 32:08.396
You'd be dead
if it wasn't for me.

32:08.398 --> 32:10.431
How the hell'd you
know it was a setup?

32:10.433 --> 32:12.733
I don't know, I'm sitting there
playing Candy Crush,

32:12.735 --> 32:15.469
and then my... my sixth sense
just started tingling.

32:15.471 --> 32:16.437
Just didn't make sense to me

32:16.439 --> 32:17.805
she'd give up Malbaton
that easy.

32:17.807 --> 32:19.673
But then I remembered,
that was her thing.

32:19.675 --> 32:21.642
- What?
- Booby traps.

32:25.781 --> 32:28.115
So I guess you saved
our lives, then.

32:28.117 --> 32:28.983
Yeah.

32:28.985 --> 32:30.251
Well, thanks.

32:30.253 --> 32:31.786
Yeah, of course.

32:31.788 --> 32:33.154
So what now?

32:33.156 --> 32:34.588
Molly's not out of the city yet.

32:34.590 --> 32:37.525
One of our cameras just got a
hit on her heading to Brooklyn.

32:37.527 --> 32:39.493
I guess
I better keep my vest on.

32:39.495 --> 32:42.396
You're damn right you better
keep your vest on. Let's go.

32:48.737 --> 32:50.671
There she is.

32:50.673 --> 32:52.306
I see her.

32:52.308 --> 32:53.841
So whatcha waiting for?

32:53.843 --> 32:55.976
She's meeting Malbaton.

32:55.978 --> 32:58.345
How do you know?

32:58.347 --> 33:00.548
'Cause she's got
two cups of coffee.

33:04.719 --> 33:06.120
There he is.

33:06.122 --> 33:07.588
Right on time.

33:09.491 --> 33:10.991
Hang on.

33:23.972 --> 33:25.372
Put your hands out of the car!

33:25.374 --> 33:28.242
Right now, out of the car!

33:28.244 --> 33:29.410
Now!

33:30.712 --> 33:32.480
Get out of the car,
put your hands in the air!

33:32.482 --> 33:36.851
This is the guy
I was telling you about.

33:36.853 --> 33:38.786
Both of you!

33:38.788 --> 33:40.287
Right now!

33:42.924 --> 33:44.658
Hands! Hands up!

33:44.660 --> 33:47.628
Get 'em up!

34:03.178 --> 34:04.178
Gun!

34:12.353 --> 34:15.255
Good?

34:15.257 --> 34:17.324
Come on. Hands against the car.

34:21.496 --> 34:22.830
Why didn't you just tell us

34:22.831 --> 34:24.831
where he was?

34:24.833 --> 34:27.001
Damn it.

34:35.976 --> 34:38.445
You got a minute, busy beaver?

34:38.447 --> 34:40.380
It's your dime, sweetheart.

34:40.382 --> 34:42.583
Got something for you.

34:42.585 --> 34:44.451
Jack made me promise

34:44.453 --> 34:47.054
to hand-deliver
this check and apologize

34:47.056 --> 34:49.389
for any inconvenience.

34:49.391 --> 34:50.757
Look, Erin...

34:50.760 --> 34:52.359
Anthony ABETEMARCO,
did you really

34:52.360 --> 34:54.094
threaten to break his kneecaps?

34:54.096 --> 34:55.496
I never said that.

34:55.498 --> 34:56.530
That's not what I'm hearing.

34:56.532 --> 34:57.598
I don't know what
he told you, but...

34:57.600 --> 34:59.700
He told me that you accused him

34:59.702 --> 35:01.435
of backing into your car.

35:01.437 --> 35:02.503
His plates came back.

35:02.505 --> 35:04.405
I mean,
there's no doubt about that.

35:04.407 --> 35:06.207
Well, that's why
you got a check.

35:08.043 --> 35:10.444
What else did he say I said?

35:10.446 --> 35:12.012
Not so much.

35:12.014 --> 35:13.981
Just that you said
that he was not allowed

35:13.983 --> 35:16.217
to come within
a hundred miles of me.

35:16.219 --> 35:18.085
Erin, let me explain.

35:18.087 --> 35:19.720
It's a company car.

35:19.722 --> 35:21.755
His partner was driving it.

35:21.757 --> 35:23.390
He's the one
that backed into you

35:23.392 --> 35:25.826
when he was playing kissy-poo,
not Jack.

35:25.828 --> 35:27.661
He was in Boston the entire day.

35:27.663 --> 35:28.929
Seriously?

35:28.931 --> 35:30.731
Seriously.

35:36.404 --> 35:37.705
I'm sorry.

35:37.707 --> 35:39.206
You must hate me, I...

35:39.208 --> 35:41.242
I can fight
my own battles, Anthony.

35:41.244 --> 35:44.178
Yeah, o-of course you can.

35:44.180 --> 35:45.379
And for the record,

35:45.381 --> 35:48.515
I don't hate you.

35:48.517 --> 35:50.851
Not even a bit.

35:53.154 --> 35:56.123
I think what you did was...

35:56.125 --> 35:59.727
really, really sweet.

36:08.069 --> 36:10.704
You're sure you don't need help
with any other cases?

36:10.706 --> 36:13.040
Yeah, I think I'm all good.

36:13.042 --> 36:17.144
Okay, well, it was a blast.

36:17.146 --> 36:19.947
Pun intended?

36:19.949 --> 36:21.482
Never mind.

36:21.484 --> 36:22.783
Look, I'll see you in a year.

36:22.785 --> 36:23.917
I wish.

36:23.919 --> 36:25.753
I still got two
and a half to go.

36:25.755 --> 36:28.255
No, that's if.

36:28.257 --> 36:30.424
If what?

36:31.259 --> 36:33.727
The guy you kneecapped,
Roberto Alonzo.

36:33.729 --> 36:35.162
He's all healed up now.

36:35.164 --> 36:39.099
That is, of course, except for
the wages that he missed out on,

36:39.101 --> 36:40.434
due to missing work.

36:40.436 --> 36:41.902
Plus interest,

36:41.904 --> 36:43.304
if you get what I'm saying?

36:43.306 --> 36:45.339
How much did it set him back?

36:45.341 --> 36:47.441
I'm guessing
about a fifth of the price

36:47.443 --> 36:49.877
of that fancy car of yours.

36:49.879 --> 36:51.345
Done.

36:51.347 --> 36:52.880
Good.

36:52.882 --> 36:54.548
Then I'll see you in a year.

37:23.912 --> 37:26.380
Just happened to be
in the neighborhood?

37:28.016 --> 37:30.017
No.

37:31.319 --> 37:34.688
So we can skip the small talk,
get right to it?

37:34.690 --> 37:37.624
Sure.

37:37.626 --> 37:39.026
Got some coffee?

37:39.028 --> 37:41.362
I'll put it on.

37:51.406 --> 37:54.375
You want to talk about
this sergeant test?

37:54.377 --> 37:56.377
If you do.

37:56.379 --> 37:58.412
No, that would be my partner.

38:01.015 --> 38:04.551
Okay, maybe I had that coming.

38:04.553 --> 38:08.355
I think you should consider it.

38:08.357 --> 38:10.758
I have.

38:10.760 --> 38:13.293
And you're not gonna take it.

38:13.295 --> 38:15.863
That's right.

38:18.066 --> 38:21.769
I am well aware
that I am the guy

38:21.771 --> 38:23.704
who stood right here and said,

38:23.706 --> 38:26.106
"If I had it
to do all over again,

38:26.108 --> 38:28.242
I'd be right where you are."

38:28.244 --> 38:29.910
Yes, you did.

38:29.912 --> 38:32.980
Yeah. And that is still true.

38:32.982 --> 38:35.182
Believe me.

38:35.184 --> 38:37.050
Yet, here we are,
having that same conversation

38:37.052 --> 38:38.452
all over again.

38:38.454 --> 38:42.189
Yeah, but... part of that
was nostalgia.

38:42.191 --> 38:45.826
Some kind of sentimentality,
like Pop's old Fitz.

38:45.828 --> 38:48.729
Well, I'm not nostalgic
or sentimental.

38:48.731 --> 38:51.698
I love my job
and I'm good at it.

38:51.700 --> 38:55.169
Yes, you are.

38:55.171 --> 38:57.571
But just 'cause
you take the test

38:57.573 --> 39:00.674
doesn't mean you have
to accept a promotion

39:00.676 --> 39:03.210
if or when your number
is called.

39:03.212 --> 39:05.412
But it doesn't hurt
to get in line.

39:05.414 --> 39:06.480
Exactly.

39:06.482 --> 39:09.082
But it does hurt, Dad.

39:11.453 --> 39:16.490
Because every time
you bring this subject up,

39:16.492 --> 39:19.726
"Step it up, Jamie.

39:19.728 --> 39:22.596
Why... Why the hell are you
taking you so long?"

39:22.598 --> 39:23.764
That's not true.

39:23.766 --> 39:24.965
There's no part of you

39:24.967 --> 39:27.734
that thinks I'm not living up
to my potential?

39:27.736 --> 39:30.938
You do have enormous talent.

39:30.940 --> 39:32.005
That you think I'm wasting.

39:32.007 --> 39:33.040
Not wasting, no.

39:33.042 --> 39:37.244
But maybe not maximizing,

39:37.246 --> 39:42.449
and I... I just don't know why.

39:44.319 --> 39:48.822
I think it's because
you're confusing two things.

39:48.824 --> 39:52.626
It isn't about me being a cop,
it's about me being a Reagan.

39:54.395 --> 39:56.563
Jamie, we are a driven
and ambitious clan,

39:56.565 --> 39:58.866
and like it or not,
you are one of us.

39:58.868 --> 40:00.534
Yes, I am.

40:00.536 --> 40:02.402
And we're a clan made up
of individuals.

40:02.404 --> 40:05.706
Nothing that says we have
to march to the same drummer.

40:05.708 --> 40:08.375
I never said you did.

40:08.377 --> 40:11.545
Pretty damn close.

40:21.990 --> 40:24.057
Of whom much is given,

40:24.059 --> 40:26.260
much is expected.

40:57.158 --> 40:59.126
Just for the record,

40:59.128 --> 41:00.961
I haven't eaten
since this morning.

41:00.963 --> 41:02.563
- Same here.
- That's a lie.

41:02.565 --> 41:04.364
You wolfed down a slice of pizza
on the way to church.

41:04.366 --> 41:05.732
That was a closet slice.
It doesn't count.

41:05.734 --> 41:07.834
Well, I had a full lunch
before mass,

41:07.836 --> 41:09.269
and I'm still starving.

41:09.271 --> 41:10.671
- Anyone else?
- Famished.

41:10.673 --> 41:11.638
Delirious.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.340
- Ravenous.
- Even my arm

41:13.342 --> 41:14.541
is starting to look good.

41:14.543 --> 41:16.577
Well, there you go.
The ayes have it.

41:16.579 --> 41:18.445
Touch that food to your lips

41:18.447 --> 41:21.148
and you die an early death.

41:21.150 --> 41:22.616
Okay, but he's late.

41:22.618 --> 41:23.784
Like, 20 minutes late.

41:23.786 --> 41:26.086
- 30.
- You guys know the rules.

41:26.088 --> 41:30.223
We don't begin until
the entire family is present.

41:30.225 --> 41:31.358
Okay.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.893
Does anyone know where he is?

41:32.895 --> 41:34.261
I've called him ten times,

41:34.263 --> 41:35.562
and he hasn't answered.

41:35.564 --> 41:36.863
Or responded to texts.

41:38.199 --> 41:40.601
Is there something going on?

41:40.603 --> 41:41.969
No, nothing at all.

41:43.671 --> 41:45.339
I haven't heard from him,

41:45.341 --> 41:47.240
and I don't know where he is.

41:47.242 --> 41:49.443
That is the best-looking salad

41:49.445 --> 41:51.211
I've ever seen.
What's wrong with you?

41:51.213 --> 41:53.347
Delirium. It's the first
signs of starvation.

41:53.349 --> 41:54.548
- Exactly.
- You people

41:54.550 --> 41:56.850
really know
how to pour it on thick.

41:56.852 --> 41:58.619
Hey, hey.

41:58.621 --> 42:00.654
- Hey!
- Nice of you

42:00.656 --> 42:01.622
to show up.

42:01.624 --> 42:02.789
Yeah, thanks for coming.

42:02.791 --> 42:04.057
Sorry I'm late, guys.

42:04.059 --> 42:06.159
That's okay. We were so hungry,
we barely noticed.

42:06.161 --> 42:07.227
I said I'm sorry.

42:07.229 --> 42:08.762
We didn't think you were coming.

42:08.764 --> 42:10.530
Have I ever missed
family dinner?

42:10.532 --> 42:12.065
Isn't that kind of the point?

42:12.067 --> 42:15.636
Yeah, well,
I lost track of time.

42:15.638 --> 42:16.937
Doing what?

42:16.939 --> 42:20.340
Helping my partner study
for the sergeant's test.

42:26.681 --> 42:28.815
Okay, well,
if no one else is going to,

42:28.817 --> 42:30.817
I'm gonna say grace,
'cause I'm hungry.

42:30.819 --> 42:32.185
Bless us, O Lord,
and these, Thy gifts,

42:32.187 --> 42:33.587
which we are about
to receive from Thy bounty.

42:33.589 --> 42:35.589
- Through Christ, our Lord. Amen. Let's eat.
- Amen.

42:35.591 --> 42:37.791
Amen.
