WEBVTT

00:02.633 --> 00:03.700
Hold up.

00:03.766 --> 00:07.700
Conservative suit,
zero‐cleavage factor.

00:07.766 --> 00:10.566
You droppin' that tired brother
Teddy tonight, huh?

00:10.633 --> 00:11.566
[scoffs]

00:11.633 --> 00:13.066
I'll give you a 7.2

00:13.133 --> 00:15.400
on the "All up
in my business" scale.

00:16.533 --> 00:17.866
[doorbell rings]

00:17.933 --> 00:21.166
Oh, that's my cue
to be up out of here.

00:21.233 --> 00:23.733
See, I don't wanna be here
when he starts making you guess

00:23.800 --> 00:26.300
how many green lights
he made on the way over.

00:26.366 --> 00:27.300
[scoffs]

00:28.333 --> 00:30.033
Hey, Teddy.

00:30.100 --> 00:31.733
Guess where I found
a parking space?

00:31.800 --> 00:32.966
Come on, guess.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.533
Okay, across the street
and three spaces down.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.466
Now, last time, it was across
the street and three spaces up.

00:40.533 --> 00:42.800
Spooky, huh?

00:46.466 --> 00:48.166
Yeah, I got a chill.

00:48.233 --> 00:50.633
Listen, um, Teddy, come on now,
we need, uh, have a seat.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.100
I think we need to talk..

00:53.366 --> 00:56.500
Now, I need a favor,
'cause my little sister, Marissa

00:56.566 --> 00:57.900
well, her boyfriend
just broke up with her

00:57.966 --> 01:00.773
and, well, she needs
a woman's point of view.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.506
Alright, well,
tell her to call me.

01:02.573 --> 01:04.506
Phones are so impersonal.

01:07.173 --> 01:08.773
Come on, girl.

01:11.406 --> 01:16.173
Marissa, this is
my lady friend Khadijah.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.606
‐ Hi.
‐ She got somethin' to tell ya.

01:17.673 --> 01:19.040
Hey, Marissa.

01:19.106 --> 01:22.973
So, uh, your boyfriend decided
he needed some air, huh?

01:23.040 --> 01:24.640
I hate him.

01:26.840 --> 01:29.240
Alright, now, just hold up now.

01:29.306 --> 01:32.573
I know‐I know you're hurtin',
but then don't take it personal.

01:34.740 --> 01:37.806
Listen, the important thing is
not to blame the other person.

01:37.873 --> 01:38.873
‐ Oh.
‐ I mean, think about it.

01:38.940 --> 01:40.240
He just made room
for the right guy

01:40.306 --> 01:42.240
to come into your life.

01:43.606 --> 01:47.273
Well, you know, I‐I never
thought about it like that.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.806
Well, you should.

01:48.873 --> 01:50.640
Shoot, everybody should.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.706
See, Marissa,
now gettin' dumped

01:53.773 --> 01:55.406
is not the end of the world.

01:55.473 --> 01:58.040
Sometimes it's the best thing
that can happen to ya.

01:58.106 --> 01:59.373
Exactly.

to my spastic colon.

02:49.046 --> 02:51.680
Jackson Turner, huh?
The lady draws a killer.

02:51.746 --> 02:53.446
Uh‐uh‐uh! Alleged killer.

02:53.513 --> 02:55.380
Actually, my client
is known for preserving life

02:55.446 --> 02:57.080
through his organization
Earth Rights.

02:57.146 --> 02:59.213
Well, you've convinced me,
why don't I just turn my back

02:59.280 --> 03:01.053
and slip you the key?

03:07.153 --> 03:08.420
Jackson Turner?

03:09.653 --> 03:12.220
Maxine Shaw,
Public Defenders Office.

03:12.286 --> 03:14.386
Well, I am pleasantly surprised.

03:14.453 --> 03:17.153
When they told me my lawyer
was somebody named Max Shaw

03:17.220 --> 03:20.586
I expected a good deal more
testosterone.

03:20.653 --> 03:22.720
Get to know me.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.253
'Alright. Let's get started.'

03:25.320 --> 03:27.486
The DA is looking for
a murder one conviction

03:27.553 --> 03:30.020
on the poisoning of Clive
Winston, CEO of Richmond Mining.

03:30.086 --> 03:31.820
Oh, this is crazy,
I wasn't even in town.

03:31.886 --> 03:33.420
I was on the shuttle
for Washington.

03:33.486 --> 03:34.620
Perfect, the credit card
receipts from tickets

03:34.686 --> 03:35.620
will prove that and we can‐‐

03:35.686 --> 03:37.620
No, I paid cash.

03:38.420 --> 03:40.353
Oh.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.086
Well, did you talk
to anyone on the plane?

03:42.153 --> 03:44.620
No, mostly I slept.

03:44.686 --> 03:46.620
Well, I was up the whole night
before, draining mucus

03:46.686 --> 03:49.353
from the blowhole
of a disoriented whale.

03:51.186 --> 03:52.953
Here's what the DA's
gonna throw at you.

03:53.020 --> 03:55.120
You threatened Winston
at a stockholder's meeting.

03:55.186 --> 03:56.753
No, I did not threaten him.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.453
He‐he called me
a stinkin' tree hugger

03:58.520 --> 04:00.326
and I said I'd,
you know, kill him.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.693
Mm‐hmm, and the police
found an engraved pen

04:04.760 --> 04:06.826
belonging to you
at the crime scene.

04:06.893 --> 04:09.393
No, that's impossible,
I only own one engraved pen

04:09.460 --> 04:11.060
and I lost it.

04:15.493 --> 04:16.993
This doesn't look good, does it?

04:17.060 --> 04:20.293
Unh‐unh. But look..

04:20.360 --> 04:22.293
don't worry about your case,
that's my problem.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.960
You just stay strong, that's how
the movement needs you.

04:25.693 --> 04:27.126
Thank you.

04:28.326 --> 04:30.260
I feel safe in your hands.

04:33.993 --> 04:35.359
Oh.

04:36.426 --> 04:37.693
Guard.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.626
Well, you see, now, I‐I‐I‐I‐I'd
never have sex with a man

04:42.693 --> 04:45.093
just because he offered me
a million dollars.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.426
Hey, girl,
that's "Crimson Tide."

04:49.560 --> 04:51.926
I know. I'm just sayin'.

04:51.993 --> 04:53.126
[doorbell rings]

04:54.493 --> 04:56.893
‐ What's up, girl?
‐ Marissa.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.993
Hey, what are you doin' here?

04:59.060 --> 05:00.500
I'm bothering you.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.466
I'm sorry, I'll just go home

05:02.533 --> 05:06.033
and put a blanket over my head
and listen to Sade.

05:06.100 --> 05:09.733
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, come on in.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.900
Everybody, this is Marissa.

05:11.966 --> 05:14.000
‐ Hello.
‐ Hey, how you doin'?

05:14.066 --> 05:17.333
Recently dumped sister
to recently dumped Teddy.

05:19.533 --> 05:20.800
Khadijah,
I brought you a present

05:20.866 --> 05:22.466
to thank you for helpin' me.

05:24.233 --> 05:26.766
‐ Cornflakes?
‐ Uh‐huh.

05:26.833 --> 05:28.300
I'll just go fix some
for you the way I like.

05:28.366 --> 05:30.500
With milk, sugar

05:30.566 --> 05:33.333
and a dash of parmesan cheese.

05:36.300 --> 05:39.933
Well, I remember the first time
I got dropped.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.433
I cried all night,
couldn't sleep.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.000
Every song on the radio
reminded me of him.

05:47.066 --> 05:48.700
But then my mama made me
some mac and cheese

05:48.766 --> 05:50.233
and I knew it was
gonna be alright.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.433
You know what I'm sayin'?

05:52.500 --> 05:55.600
You see, the problem with that
boy was that he was immature.

05:55.666 --> 05:57.733
Now, you take
my first boyfriend.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.666
Ah, he was 12 and a half

05:59.733 --> 06:02.006
but he had the presence
of a 13‐year‐old.

06:03.773 --> 06:05.373
And the allowance.

06:08.673 --> 06:11.173
Oh, I just spent
the last 14 hours

06:11.240 --> 06:12.806
at the Hall of Records.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.573
There is nothing
more exasperating

06:14.640 --> 06:16.773
than preparing a murder case.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.573
You ever try to fire up
a barbeque

06:18.640 --> 06:20.240
in the middle
of a light drizzle

06:20.306 --> 06:21.973
with everybody
standin' around tellin' me.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.406
‐ "Where's my hot link?"
‐ Obie.

06:23.473 --> 06:24.973
‐ "Where's my hot link?"
‐ Obie.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.273
‐ Obie, Obie, Obie.
‐ Can I get a‐‐

06:26.340 --> 06:29.873
We apologized for that.
Now, let's just move on now.

06:29.940 --> 06:33.073
Max, I ain't never seen you
this worked up over a case.

06:33.140 --> 06:35.306
I mean, what's up with
this Earth Rights guy?

06:35.373 --> 06:38.873
The man stands for something,
the fact that he's charismatic

06:38.940 --> 06:40.673
incredibly handsome,
and an absolute turn on

06:40.740 --> 06:43.006
has nothing to do with anything.

06:44.273 --> 06:45.773
Then what you doin'
with this picture of him

06:45.840 --> 06:48.106
strollin' up out the water
in a swimsuit?

06:51.173 --> 06:54.273
That's for identification
purposes.

06:54.340 --> 06:55.840
You know, Max, you know
you're not supposed to get

06:55.906 --> 06:57.140
personally involved.

06:57.206 --> 06:58.673
I mean, suppose he's guilty?

06:58.740 --> 07:01.846
Impossible.

07:01.913 --> 07:03.780
Let me tell you something,
I saw that guy on TV

07:03.846 --> 07:05.480
protesting this
cosmetics company

07:05.546 --> 07:07.880
for testing products on rabbits.

07:07.946 --> 07:11.146
Anybody who loves bunnies enough
to punch out six cops

07:11.213 --> 07:13.146
is not a violent man.

07:14.213 --> 07:15.646
[knocking on door]

07:15.713 --> 07:18.646
Hey, hey, people. Maxine.

07:18.713 --> 07:22.946
I have a proposition for you
and I hope you will accept.

07:23.013 --> 07:25.746
Sure, Kyle, but you'll
have to kill me first.

07:25.813 --> 07:29.280
Let's table that intriguing
concept until later, shall we?

07:29.346 --> 07:31.280
Now, when I first heard
of the poisoning

07:31.346 --> 07:33.613
of Richmond Mining CEO

07:33.680 --> 07:37.480
I immediately pushed my clients
into more competing stocks.

07:37.546 --> 07:40.013
So, the more
the public perceives

07:40.080 --> 07:43.846
Richmond to be crumbling,
the better it is for me.

07:43.913 --> 07:45.546
So, if you can find a way

07:45.613 --> 07:49.213
to prolong..

07:51.280 --> 07:54.113
...the trial,
I promise to undress

07:54.180 --> 07:56.446
with my shades up for a week.

07:58.246 --> 08:00.420
Sure, Kyle, just paint
a bullseye on your ass.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.053
There's my brilliant attorney.

08:08.120 --> 08:11.086
‐ What can I say?
‐ Don't thank me.

08:11.153 --> 08:14.153
‐ Alright, go ahead.
‐ You are incredible.

08:14.220 --> 08:15.653
If you hadn't tracked down
the flight attendant

08:15.720 --> 08:17.786
who remembered how loudly
I was snoring

08:17.853 --> 08:19.686
I'd be in the shower
playing "Hard to get"

08:19.753 --> 08:22.853
with a big guy named Lobo.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.753
Ah, well, I just saved your
butt, you go save the planet.

08:25.820 --> 08:28.353
Max, there's been something
I wanted to tell you

08:28.420 --> 08:29.853
ever since we first met.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.686
I, uh..

08:35.753 --> 08:38.186
Well.. Oh, hell.

08:41.385 --> 08:43.320
[moaning]

08:44.686 --> 08:46.020
Ooh.

08:47.086 --> 08:49.153
Jackson, um, uh.

08:49.220 --> 08:51.720
This sort of behavior
isn't‐isn't appropriate

08:51.786 --> 08:52.886
in a correctional facility.

08:52.953 --> 08:53.886
[chuckles]

08:53.953 --> 08:56.386
Obviously, you haven't met Lobo.

08:57.953 --> 08:59.220
Jackson.

09:02.693 --> 09:04.493
[grunting]

09:04.560 --> 09:06.993
Max, you Albert Peignor

09:07.060 --> 09:09.393
executive director of,
uh, Earth Rights?

09:09.460 --> 09:12.760
Of course, of course, you gave
me a nuclear winter snow globe.

09:12.826 --> 09:14.326
Thank you, Miss Shaw.

09:14.393 --> 09:17.126
I'm sure that even those forms
of life that have no face

09:17.193 --> 09:20.693
would be smiling in gratitude,
if they could.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.693
‐ Thanks, Albert.
‐ Jackson.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.560
We really should be
getting back to the office.

09:24.626 --> 09:26.893
Lisa wants to brief you
on the Shenandoah operation.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.760
‐ That can wait.
‐ Uh.. Ahem.

09:29.826 --> 09:33.193
But, uh, I brought the solar car
and it looks like rain.

09:33.260 --> 09:35.026
I said it'll wait.

09:44.926 --> 09:47.293
I've been known to make
an ecologically responsible

09:47.360 --> 09:50.060
eggplant casserole
that'll knock your socks off.

09:50.126 --> 09:53.226
I live upstate about an hour
from here. Care to join me?

09:53.293 --> 09:56.860
Well, I, I mean,
I don't know, I mean.

09:56.926 --> 09:58.560
I have cases
that I should be doing.

09:58.626 --> 10:01.033
Ever been out with a guy
who just got out of prison?

10:01.100 --> 10:03.033
Uh‐huh. Let's go.

10:10.733 --> 10:12.300
Oh, goodness.

10:12.366 --> 10:15.800
The air must really be thin up
here, I'm out of breath.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.200
Well, now, we're even.

10:17.266 --> 10:19.700
You've been taking
my breath away all day.

10:23.533 --> 10:25.000
Hey!

10:25.066 --> 10:27.000
What kind of peekaboo
freak are you?

10:27.066 --> 10:29.500
Oh, oh, that's to record
the mating habits

10:29.566 --> 10:31.233
of my little friends here.

10:31.300 --> 10:33.733
Oh, damn, whoo.
Couldn't you just get a dog?

10:35.433 --> 10:37.266
Arachnus Nimbius..

10:37.333 --> 10:40.200
Aka Caracas sand spiders.

10:40.266 --> 10:41.900
They're this close
to becoming extinct.

10:41.966 --> 10:44.066
Oh, I hate spiders,
ever since one bit me

10:44.133 --> 10:46.733
and my checks swelled up
like Dizzy Gillespie's.

10:49.266 --> 10:50.833
Be glad it wasn't one of these.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.366
You would have been dead
in 15 minutes.

10:53.433 --> 10:56.066
Listen, I better get the
groceries out of the truck.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.166
Coyotes have been known
to go through a windshield

10:58.233 --> 10:59.200
for bean curd.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.173
Oh, my God!

11:04.773 --> 11:06.873
Spiders, coyote.

11:06.940 --> 11:07.873
[telephone rings]

11:07.940 --> 11:09.540
Sasquatch.

11:13.806 --> 11:16.240
‐ Max Shaw here.
‐ Hey, Max.

11:16.306 --> 11:18.206
It's, uh, Robin,
over at forensics.

11:18.273 --> 11:20.840
We nailed down which poison
took Winston out.

11:20.906 --> 11:23.506
Oh, yeah? I thought you said
Winston was killed by arsenic.

11:23.573 --> 11:25.406
It looked like arsenic,
but it turned out

11:25.473 --> 11:28.173
to be the venom of a rare
poisonous spider

11:28.240 --> 11:30.340
found only in Venezuela.

11:33.706 --> 11:35.006
The Ca..

11:35.073 --> 11:36.340
The C‐Caracas

11:36.406 --> 11:38.873
the Caracas sand spider?

11:38.940 --> 11:41.073
Hey, how did you know?

11:41.140 --> 11:44.073
Just a feelin'
in the pit of my stomach.

11:50.940 --> 11:52.373
Get out.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.773
[gasps]

11:56.840 --> 11:58.873
No. Another way in.

12:00.280 --> 12:01.713
[screams]

12:06.413 --> 12:09.113
Oh, my God,
no sign of madness.

12:09.180 --> 12:10.146
Oh!

12:13.113 --> 12:14.280
What are you doing?

12:14.346 --> 12:15.480
Oh, okay.

12:15.546 --> 12:16.713
Uh, uh, didn't you

12:16.780 --> 12:18.213
didn't you yell fire?

12:18.280 --> 12:19.613
‐ What?
‐ Well, nothing.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.013
Look, look, look,
look, Jackson, you know

12:21.080 --> 12:24.513
I, I have to go, um,
this, this, this whole thing

12:24.580 --> 12:26.880
is just moving,
moving way too fast.

12:26.946 --> 12:29.080
Alright, you've done it now.

12:29.146 --> 12:32.080
The truth is I'm a virgin.

12:33.946 --> 12:36.513
And I have to go to church now.

12:36.580 --> 12:38.146
Well, no, no, Max,
we don't have to do anything

12:38.213 --> 12:39.413
but eat dinner.

12:39.480 --> 12:40.480
What do you mean "Eat dinner?"

12:40.546 --> 12:42.113
What kind of girl
do you think I am?

12:46.513 --> 12:48.613
Khadijah, your little friend
has been holed up

12:48.680 --> 12:50.813
in the bathroom
for the last 45 minutes

12:50.880 --> 12:54.013
chattin' on the phone
about Coolio.

12:54.080 --> 12:57.513
Hey, get off my phone
and out of my john.

12:58.646 --> 13:00.753
‐ She got to go.
‐ Oh, Regine.

13:00.820 --> 13:05.020
Go easy on her. You've got
kicked to the curb before.

13:05.086 --> 13:07.020
You'll be there again.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.286
Y'all out of toilet paper again.

13:12.353 --> 13:15.886
And if I may
make a suggestion, two‐ply.

13:18.586 --> 13:19.886
Honestly, that's it.

13:19.953 --> 13:21.186
You don't just come up
in my house

13:21.253 --> 13:22.186
dissin' my toilet paper.

13:22.253 --> 13:24.020
She is outta here.

13:26.886 --> 13:28.486
Oh, no.

13:31.386 --> 13:33.420
Oh, I'm gonna die.

13:33.486 --> 13:35.086
How could I've been such a fool?

13:36.653 --> 13:38.220
Max, you haven't been
moonin' the guys

13:38.286 --> 13:41.420
on the prison bus again,
have you?

13:41.486 --> 13:42.853
She thinks that Jackson Turner

13:42.920 --> 13:44.420
might be the murderer
after all.

13:44.486 --> 13:47.686
Oh, God, the bast‐that bastard.

13:47.753 --> 13:48.986
He used me.

13:49.053 --> 13:50.753
Didn't you prove
that he was on an airplane

13:50.820 --> 13:52.153
at the time of the murder?

13:52.220 --> 13:55.820
Oh, all he had to do
was plant the poisonous spider

13:55.886 --> 13:57.953
catch a flight to DC,
and let the creepy crawler

13:58.020 --> 13:59.720
do the killing for him.

13:59.786 --> 14:02.726
He played me, Khadijah. No.

14:04.793 --> 14:06.726
Max, look on the bright side.

14:06.793 --> 14:10.226
You finally found somebody
who isn't too good for you.

14:11.860 --> 14:15.926
Why? Why do I keep pickin'
all the wrong men?

14:15.993 --> 14:18.726
First Kyle, now a killer.

14:18.793 --> 14:20.160
What next, Callaghan?

14:20.226 --> 14:21.993
No!

14:23.460 --> 14:25.726
I mean, look, what does it say
about our society

14:25.793 --> 14:28.993
when a man who's not even rich
can elude our justice system?

14:30.426 --> 14:32.593
Listen, Max.

14:32.660 --> 14:34.560
Before this guy shows up
with a..

14:34.626 --> 14:36.993
...with a mean look on his face
and a bag full of spiders

14:37.060 --> 14:39.526
I think we should give
the cops a jingle.

14:39.593 --> 14:41.193
Wait a minute, what for?

14:45.060 --> 14:48.326
I mean, anybody,
anybody doin' any good?

14:48.393 --> 14:50.493
I mean, all I‐all I've got
is a theory.

14:51.893 --> 14:55.093
Well, no one runs a game
on Maxine Shaw.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.693
I'm going back up to that cabin

14:56.760 --> 14:58.393
and get something
to nail him with.

14:58.460 --> 15:00.900
Come on, Overton, let's go.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.600
Um.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.833
Yeah, yeah.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.666
Of course, Max, you go
get your, uh, lasso of truth

15:09.733 --> 15:13.900
and I'll go, uh, warm up
the invisible Obie plane.

15:13.966 --> 15:15.600
Hey, look, Obie,
there's no danger.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.933
Jackson told me he was flying to
the Shenandoah Valley tonight.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.666
I just need you
for good luck.

15:19.733 --> 15:22.266
Well, might sound
a trifle overblown

15:22.333 --> 15:25.700
but I know why God gave me
these lifesaving abilities.

15:27.433 --> 15:28.866
Let's do this.

15:30.900 --> 15:33.166
Alright, now, look here, Missy,
I got somethin' to say to you.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.966
Well, make it quick,
'cause I'm about to be out.

15:35.033 --> 15:38.700
Oh, no, girl. It's too soon.
Well, look, here's your kicks.

15:38.766 --> 15:42.166
And is this your coat?
Well, keep it anyway. Bye.

15:42.233 --> 15:45.000
Say, one hour
on the Coolio chat line

15:45.066 --> 15:47.066
and you back
in circulation, huh?

15:47.133 --> 15:50.333
That's not it all.
Y'all are crazy.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.500
Poisonous spiders,
killers on the loose.

15:53.566 --> 15:57.500
I hope I'm not as crazy
as y'all when I hit middle age.

16:00.106 --> 16:03.373
Um, Khadijah.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.706
My mother hates for me to ride
the train after dark.

16:05.773 --> 16:08.273
Can‐can you drop me off at home?

16:08.340 --> 16:13.140
Sure, you just keep
that door on your side unlocked.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.473
When we get near your house,
I'll slow down to about 40.

16:15.540 --> 16:17.473
You could do a tuck and roll.

16:19.940 --> 16:20.906
[door opens]

16:25.440 --> 16:27.973
How the hell did you get
the key for this door?

16:28.040 --> 16:30.373
Actually, none of these fit.
It was open.

16:34.406 --> 16:36.240
What exactly are we
lookin' for, girl?

16:36.306 --> 16:38.406
I don't know.

16:38.473 --> 16:40.406
Yeah, that's a good plan.

16:42.106 --> 16:45.440
This dude got some nice stuff
up in through here.

16:45.506 --> 16:49.173
Two hundred power stereo
microscope.

16:49.240 --> 16:52.173
High resolution security camera.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.706
Big hairy ass spiders.

16:57.740 --> 17:01.413
Max, if, uh,
if we were in a movie

17:01.480 --> 17:03.680
it'd be right about now
we start screaming

17:03.746 --> 17:05.313
"Get the hell out of the house."

17:05.380 --> 17:06.680
Shh!

17:06.746 --> 17:08.980
Wait a minute. Look.

17:09.046 --> 17:12.680
If Jackson took a spider to
plant in Winston's apartment

17:12.746 --> 17:14.313
it would be on video tape.

17:14.380 --> 17:15.980
You've got to find the tapes
before the murder.

17:18.012 --> 17:19.913
Max?

17:19.980 --> 17:21.413
What the hell is goin' on?

17:23.012 --> 17:26.546
I come all the way up here
in the dead of night

17:26.613 --> 17:29.146
just to see you and this is
the warm welcome I get?

17:29.213 --> 17:30.880
Well, forget you.
Come on, Overton, let's go.

17:33.346 --> 17:35.913
Just a second. Who are you?

17:35.980 --> 17:38.780
Uh, I'm Overton Wakefield Jones.

17:38.846 --> 17:41.580
I just broke out of Sing Sing,
ain't got nothin' to lose.

17:41.646 --> 17:44.246
Don't start nothin',
won't be nothin', okay?

17:48.413 --> 17:50.680
Oh, I know why you're here,
you think I did it.

17:50.746 --> 17:53.780
Hey, look, I'm on your side,
but the toxicologist said

17:53.846 --> 17:56.280
that Winston was killed
by the bite of a sand spider.

17:56.346 --> 17:57.980
Oh, that's impossible,
these eight

17:58.046 --> 18:00.353
are the only ones
in the country and..

18:00.420 --> 18:02.353
Itsy?

18:02.420 --> 18:04.120
Where's Itsy?

18:04.186 --> 18:07.186
Probably in some hideaway
down on the Cayman Islands

18:07.253 --> 18:09.186
sippin' a Bloody Mary.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.186
I hope that's Domino's.

18:14.253 --> 18:17.186
[screaming]

18:23.820 --> 18:24.953
Who are you?

18:25.020 --> 18:27.820
We'll ask the questions
around here, buddy.

18:27.886 --> 18:29.720
We were worried,
so we followed you.

18:29.786 --> 18:30.920
Oh.

18:30.986 --> 18:32.253
Now, that I know
that you're alright

18:32.320 --> 18:34.586
I have to tinkle
in the worst way, excuse me.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.153
You were worried about me?

18:38.220 --> 18:40.153
Yeah, well, you do owe me $6.

18:41.486 --> 18:43.953
Jackson, who else
knows about these spiders?

18:44.020 --> 18:46.086
Just Peignor.

18:46.153 --> 18:48.886
You know he could have planted
the pen at the crime scene?

18:48.953 --> 18:50.886
Jackson, your bathroom
is occupied.

18:50.953 --> 18:53.886
‐ Shut up!
‐ Oh, okay, okay.

18:53.953 --> 18:54.920
Gun!

19:00.160 --> 19:02.893
‐ Albert, give me the gun.
‐ Shut up!

19:02.960 --> 19:04.560
Give me the tape.

19:08.260 --> 19:11.260
You big dodo‐head!

19:12.793 --> 19:16.226
The movement needs someone with
guts to do what's necessary.

19:16.293 --> 19:17.960
Including murder?

19:18.026 --> 19:20.060
It's better than empty rhetoric.

19:20.126 --> 19:22.626
Photo opportunities.

19:22.693 --> 19:23.793
Excuse me, Mr. Peignor.

19:23.860 --> 19:25.593
I had a ginger ale
on the drive here

19:25.660 --> 19:26.760
and I have really got to‐‐

19:26.826 --> 19:29.093
Shut up!

19:30.426 --> 19:31.360
Oh.

19:31.426 --> 19:34.360
[screaming]

19:36.493 --> 19:38.060
(Jackson)
'Nobody move!'

19:39.726 --> 19:41.660
They react to sudden movement.

19:46.626 --> 19:48.393
Peignor, heads up.

19:48.460 --> 19:49.426
Oh.

19:50.460 --> 19:52.393
Oh, that was silly.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.060
Ow!

19:57.960 --> 19:59.693
Don't worry.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.333
He won't die if we get him
to the clinic right away.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.333
Well, I'm sure if you explain
that to the spiders

20:04.400 --> 20:07.000
maybe they'll go outside
and warm up the car for you.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.800
Just wish we had some meat
to distract them.

20:10.866 --> 20:12.366
How 'bout a turkey jerky?

20:12.433 --> 20:14.433
No, actually I try to keep them
away from processed food.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.266
Would you throw that thing?

20:19.466 --> 20:20.633
‐ 'Come one, shorty.'
‐ Oh.

20:20.700 --> 20:22.133
‐ Gimme a hand.
‐ Oh.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.900
Oh. Hey, Regine?

20:23.966 --> 20:26.400
Quit frettin',
the danger's over.

20:26.466 --> 20:27.700
‐ Come on, girl.
‐ Honestly, girl.

20:27.766 --> 20:29.600
‐ You know I'm playin'.
‐ I know you are, girl.

20:29.666 --> 20:32.600
[clamoring]

20:34.866 --> 20:36.766
Come on.

20:36.833 --> 20:40.500
Jackson, from the very start,
my lawyer's gut

20:40.566 --> 20:42.433
it told me you must be innocent.

20:42.500 --> 20:46.566
It said, "No man with pecs
like that could be guilty."

20:49.233 --> 20:51.566
You could make it up to me.

20:51.633 --> 20:53.533
Any chance of us getting
better acquainted

20:53.600 --> 20:56.233
on a working vacation
in New Mexico?

20:56.300 --> 20:58.933
Oh, the land of enchantment.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.873
We're rappelling
into a remote canyon

21:00.940 --> 21:04.206
to gather an endangered
species of giant scorpion.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.740
Pick me up a t‐shirt, okay?

21:10.073 --> 21:11.373
[laughs]

21:11.440 --> 21:12.540
See ya!

21:14.306 --> 21:15.773
