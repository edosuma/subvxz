00:01.419 --> 00:04.005
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.338 --> 00:06.590
What I was in the Framework
wasn't programming.

00:06.757 --> 00:09.885
Every light needs a shadow.
You just have to learn how to control it.

00:10.052 --> 00:13.097
- Mum?
- The steps you take don't need to be big,

00:13.264 --> 00:15.141
...they just need to take you
in the right direction.

00:15.307 --> 00:17.893
- You always used to say that.
- My mum said it to me.

00:18.102 --> 00:19.979
The steps you take don't need to be big,

00:20.146 --> 00:22.064
they just need to take you
in the right direction.

00:23.482 --> 00:26.485
When the monoliths exploded,
they tore open a fear dimension.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.612
<i>It's our fears come to life.</i>

00:28.988 --> 00:32.116
The gravitonium device that we used
to seal the rift is barely strong enough.

00:32.283 --> 00:34.493
Right, so we need more gravitonium
to seal the rift for good.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.245
<i>If you can box it up
without touching it,</i>

00:36.412 --> 00:38.247
<i>you might be able to get it off the ship.</i>

00:39.248 --> 00:40.541
One ball of gravitonium.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.960
- Thank you.
- Guess what I got you?

00:45.796 --> 00:47.131
Arms.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.503
I want Hobnobs.

01:26.128 --> 01:30.132
- I can search the stock for biscuits.
- No! No, no. I want the real thing.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.510
I want proper British junk food.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.514
I want Maltesers and I want Twiglets!

01:36.680 --> 01:38.599
You remember when care packages
were the only way

01:38.766 --> 01:40.768
to get through cramming at the Academy?

01:41.393 --> 01:45.106
Yup, but those were problems
we could actually solve.

01:46.482 --> 01:49.318
The gravitonium needs to be compressed
to work with this.

01:49.527 --> 01:52.696
I have no idea how to do that.
I don't know how...

01:54.949 --> 01:57.034
Why did it have to be a fear dimension
coming to life?

01:57.201 --> 01:59.578
Why couldn't it be dreams or wishes?

02:00.704 --> 02:02.039
What would your wish be?

02:05.209 --> 02:07.169
An extra day between Saturday and Sunday.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.798
- You?
- Speak any language.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.552
Or a honeymoon.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.101
Uh... C... Uh...
Can you grab me the crimpers?

02:23.018 --> 02:24.061
Yeah.

02:25.187 --> 02:29.150
Now, if we had more than one wish,
flying wouldn't be bad.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.277
Or a pony.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.113
Or a flying pon...

02:35.990 --> 02:37.116
Jemma!

03:04.518 --> 03:06.020
It's good, but don't push yourself.

03:06.228 --> 03:09.023
If I'm not pushing myself,
then what's the point of this test?

03:09.398 --> 03:10.608
Crank it up.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.069
Let's see what I can do.

03:14.236 --> 03:16.989
Right now, you're at ten percent feedback
to your nerves.

03:17.156 --> 03:20.409
If just this level's causing you
that much pain, then maybe you should...

03:21.744 --> 03:24.496
Okay.
I think that's enough for today.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.754
This arm is just a prototype.

03:31.921 --> 03:35.466
Fitz and I only had so much to work with
from the salvaged clangers

03:35.674 --> 03:39.053
we brought back, but...
...we'll figure something out.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.890
In the meantime...

03:45.017 --> 03:47.686
I'll get these diagnostics to Fitz,
and then, uh...

03:47.937 --> 03:49.939
- maybe we could add some additional...
- I don't need

03:50.105 --> 03:51.440
any bells and whistles, Mack.

03:51.857 --> 03:55.236
- I just need to be able to punch things.
- Your arms aren't fully healed yet.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.697
- What you need is time.
- My arms may not work, but my eyes do.

03:59.531 --> 04:02.576
At least let me sit in Control,
keep an eye out for anomalies.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.953
Maybe.

04:04.787 --> 04:07.498
But... you have to allow yourself to heal.

04:07.665 --> 04:10.918
We'll handle the fighting for now.
We've already got an op up and running

04:11.085 --> 04:12.836
to find the people who did this to you.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.719
We'll protect you, <i>mi amor.</i>

04:21.262 --> 04:24.598
Even if it's from yourself.
That's what family does.

04:27.685 --> 04:29.937
The gravitonium from Deke's...

04:30.771 --> 04:34.525
gravity gizmo was intensely compressed.

04:34.858 --> 04:37.945
Refined in a way that I cannot duplicate

04:38.112 --> 04:39.863
with the raw element
we got from the <i>Principia.</i>

04:40.030 --> 04:42.574
Let alone inserting it
into this new device.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.911
So, I was hoping that, that Deke
might be able have some more insight

04:46.078 --> 04:47.496
into exactly how it works.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.790
Deke?

04:53.460 --> 04:55.754
- Deke!
- Okay, well, I don't know much

04:55.921 --> 04:57.423
about the stuff inside, I just...

04:58.090 --> 04:59.425
know that it's saved...

05:00.342 --> 05:02.177
saved my ass, like, a thousand times.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.016
Okay, well, the short amount of time
that we bought ourselves is up,

05:07.182 --> 05:10.060
- so, what's the plan?
- Well, I've temporarily plugged the dam,

05:10.227 --> 05:14.231
but it could burst any minute,
releasing more of these...

05:14.565 --> 05:17.818
- anomalies into the base.
- Or worse, out into the world.

05:18.444 --> 05:20.696
Are you okay, by the way?
That could not have been easy.

05:20.863 --> 05:24.199
I'm fine. The astronaut isn't even
my greatest fear.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.328
Goodness knows what else
could come crawling out of there.

05:29.455 --> 05:30.539
Just...

05:31.290 --> 05:34.209
trust me. I can figure this out.
I just... I need...

05:36.587 --> 05:38.547
I'll experiment all night if I have to.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.591
Okay, so what do we do?

05:42.343 --> 05:44.803
Maybe I can find some
of Dr Franklin Hall's original notes.

05:44.970 --> 05:48.015
Yeah, that could give us some insight
into the nature of the element.

05:48.182 --> 05:51.560
- I'll see what I can find on the database.
- Hey, please be careful!

05:52.311 --> 05:56.231
Just because we keep putting ourselves
in increasingly perilous...

05:56.815 --> 06:00.361
situations, which is worrisome.
And I just don't want...

06:00.986 --> 06:03.906
anything to happen to you. Your...
To your... your brains,

06:04.073 --> 06:06.241
'cause they're so smart that if...

06:06.533 --> 06:08.786
We... We need those to survive.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.247
Thanks, Deke.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.209
Come on.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.172
They're okay, right? Like, they're gon...
Like, they're gonna be...

06:20.339 --> 06:22.800
- They're gonna be fine?
- They'll figure it out. Have faith.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.885
Or a... you know...

06:25.719 --> 06:26.720
Xanax.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.765
Guess I was just super moved
by their nuptials.

06:29.932 --> 06:32.559
I've become very invested in them
as a couple. I just want them to...

06:33.102 --> 06:35.396
you know, last for, like,
a long, long time.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.939
Oh, hold on.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.816
Looks like we got a tracking hit.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.693
Our intel was right.

06:42.528 --> 06:45.447
Everyone slips up sometimes,
even Air Force generals.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.658
I'll send him the coordinates now.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.130
I wasn't aware
that the timetable was so strict.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.009
I'm not making excuses,
but there is no reason to...

07:08.762 --> 07:09.930
Yes, we're close.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.667
Looks like you were right.
Good first stop on your redemption tour.

07:38.876 --> 07:42.004
Thank you, sir. Feels good
to get one over on Hale in return.

07:42.296 --> 07:45.382
You'd think our military would have
better encryption on their phones.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.510
Radio home, tell them
we bagged us a general.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.436
Fitz! There you are. They...

07:57.811 --> 08:00.647
They told me to tell you
that they got her. General Hale.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.319
All right, well...

08:06.153 --> 08:07.946
I wasn't really expecting confetti
or anything,

08:08.113 --> 08:11.742
but maybe, like, a "Blimey!"
or, like, some kind of acknowledgment.

08:14.536 --> 08:15.579
You need a hand?

08:17.122 --> 08:20.375
I'm pretty good with metal work.
I guess it runs in my DNA.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.004
All right, man, well, I'm no doctor,

08:24.171 --> 08:25.797
but that looks like the opposite
of what you're suppo...

08:33.138 --> 08:34.139
No.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.061
I'm the only doctor here.

09:05.796 --> 09:06.922
General Hale?

09:08.966 --> 09:12.719
Soundproof walls, low lighting,
sensory deprivation?

09:14.346 --> 09:18.141
- Wow, what's next, blasting death metal?
- I'm not here to torture you, General.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.228
I just wanna sit down and talk.

09:21.562 --> 09:24.064
Ask you some questions
that have been bugging me lately.

09:24.273 --> 09:25.274
Where's my driver?

09:25.440 --> 09:27.442
Let's start with why you've declared war
on my people.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.903
That's a tad dramatic.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.740
I'm a general
in the United States Air Force.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.326
You're the leader
of a domestic terrorist organisation.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.078
I'm just trying to bring you to justice.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.454
I missed the part where "bring to justice"

09:39.621 --> 09:41.415
and "blow up with beacon bombs"
are analogous.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.293
I have orders not to let you escape
by any means.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.461
I'm simply doing my job.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.424
Is it your job
to cut the arms off one of my agents?

09:54.011 --> 09:55.721
For that, I do apologise.

09:56.430 --> 09:59.558
One of my subordinates
got a bit overzealous.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.020
I'm sure you can understand.
I mean, after all,

10:03.395 --> 10:06.440
wasn't it your Agent Johnson
who shot our mutual friend Glenn Talbot

10:06.607 --> 10:07.816
- in the head?
- That wasn't Daisy.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.401
Ever the guardian, huh?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.779
"Get behind my shield. I'll protect you."

10:14.948 --> 10:16.283
I can see why people follow you

10:16.450 --> 10:17.743
- so blindly.
- It's called loyalty.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.995
But only to a point.
You need more than that

10:20.162 --> 10:22.289
- for what I'm trying to do.
- And what would that be?

10:23.707 --> 10:25.250
Prevent our extinction.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.214
- I need to access the main terminal.
- Okay.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.382
- Here.
- What?

10:32.633 --> 10:34.718
Couldn't find any physical notes
from Dr Hall.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.845
Tell me someone scanned them
into the system.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.932
Rude. I... I already did,
and I couldn't find anything.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.060
Nothing?

10:43.518 --> 10:45.479
We have zero records
of his actual research?

10:45.646 --> 10:46.772
Nothing.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.442
Fitz, my...

10:51.068 --> 10:52.402
How is that possible?

10:52.986 --> 10:56.823
Okay, you don't need to beat yourself
or the computer up over this.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.575
Are you okay? Have you even slept?

10:58.742 --> 11:01.203
During what possible period
of time, Daisy?

11:01.411 --> 11:04.831
Okay, Fitz, you don't need to carry
the weight of the world. We are all here.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.626
I mean, even Yo-Yo wants me to set up
a security feed in the med bay

11:07.793 --> 11:11.171
- so she can watch out for anomalies.
- What am I missing?

11:11.505 --> 11:12.547
Fitz...

11:13.590 --> 11:15.258
No, no, no, no, no, no.

11:16.301 --> 11:19.012
- We just lost two cameras.
- That's ten levels below us.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.640
Do you think it's another anomaly flare?

11:22.057 --> 11:24.017
We know it can reach
beyond its origin point.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.896
If we don't contain it, soon there won't
be any safe levels in the whole base.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.942
Okay, well, I'll... I'll go check it out.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.778
We're all doing our part,
just take it easy, okay?

11:42.119 --> 11:43.995
Okay. Okay.

11:45.414 --> 11:46.456
Okay.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.584
Just run possible simulations...

11:50.961 --> 11:53.463
to compensate for the uneven...

11:54.005 --> 11:55.173
distribution...

11:55.966 --> 11:57.134
of...

12:01.138 --> 12:03.056
Come on, Fitz. Think!

12:04.224 --> 12:05.600
You're on the right track.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.737
You're not quite there yet.

12:18.697 --> 12:19.781
Oh, no.

12:22.284 --> 12:26.037
- No, you cannot be here.
- There's work that needs to be finished.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.206
What... What work?

12:32.169 --> 12:33.712
What are you... What are you doing here?

12:34.337 --> 12:38.175
What you... are unwilling to do.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.093
Wait, what's going on?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.137
More anomalies have begun
occurring.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.848
Until we get a better handle
on the situation, we're moving you

12:45.015 --> 12:46.641
to another floor, out of the line of fire.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.393
And what's my say in all this?

12:49.352 --> 12:51.229
I'm not brain-dead!
I can speak for myself.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.981
We think you'll be safer on another floor.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.941
Stop treating me like a child, Mack.

12:56.151 --> 12:57.944
I'm an agent. Same as both of you.

12:58.653 --> 13:01.698
If things are getting crazier around here,
then you need me more than ever.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.283
I don't need you to protect me.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.036
Don't move.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.581
<i>This can't be real.</i>

13:10.832 --> 13:12.209
Like the astronaut wasn't real?

13:13.877 --> 13:15.045
Like the world...

13:16.588 --> 13:17.672
my world...

13:18.673 --> 13:19.841
that you destroyed...

13:21.092 --> 13:23.136
wasn't real? Come on.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.223
We both know better than that.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.935
I'm very real. And I...

13:30.602 --> 13:32.062
I'm gonna finish...

13:33.104 --> 13:34.397
what you started.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.817
I didn't... I didn't start anything.
That was all you.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.361
Not me. That's not me.

13:42.405 --> 13:43.657
But you and I are the same.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.368
Aren't we?

13:47.202 --> 13:48.245
Fitz?

13:51.206 --> 13:52.916
That's what they call you here, isn't it?

13:56.086 --> 13:57.337
So familiar.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.592
No.

14:03.134 --> 14:06.638
No, 'cause w... No, whatever it is
that you're planning, I'll stop you.

14:06.805 --> 14:07.889
Come on.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.351
You couldn't stop me if you wanted to.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.146
Plans...

14:16.064 --> 14:18.066
are already in motion.

14:21.278 --> 14:22.320
<i>Fitz!</i>

14:23.947 --> 14:26.157
You can't escape me, Fitz.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.330
We're not finished yet!

14:37.127 --> 14:38.336
Saving humanity...

14:39.337 --> 14:41.423
- That's usually my line.
- I don't think you understand

14:41.590 --> 14:45.093
the forces at play here. My vantage point
is much higher than yours.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.095
<i>What are you
trying to save the planet from?</i>

14:47.262 --> 14:48.763
<i>Why do you need the gravitonium?</i>

14:49.472 --> 14:52.976
<i>No, I understand you, Agent Coulson.
I even admire you a bit.</i>

14:54.311 --> 14:55.937
<i>But I don't trust you yet.</i>

14:56.897 --> 14:58.940
That feeling is becoming
increasingly mutual.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.276
You're not exactly giving off
benevolent vibes here.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.194
Benevolence is not enough.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.656
Your charisma and empathy
is only gonna get you so far.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.951
I don't lose sleep at night
worried about the difficult calls.

15:10.118 --> 15:13.496
I do what's necessary.
And yes, sometimes, people have to die.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.752
But I'm willing
to pull the trigger. Are you?

15:18.919 --> 15:21.004
If the right person's
on the other end of the gun.

15:21.171 --> 15:23.340
Then let me point it
in the right direction.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.385
Let me show you
what we're really up against.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.431
Come with me.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.143
No, thank you.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.482
I don't like taking orders
from backseat pilots.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.031
But I've always been in the driver's seat.

15:49.866 --> 15:50.909
Oh, come on.

15:52.452 --> 15:56.498
Do you really think that hacking my phone
was some sort of stealthy exploit

15:56.665 --> 15:58.041
I was unaware of?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.086
You underestimate me.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.338
What is it, Piper?

16:03.672 --> 16:05.465
We tried to pull the sleeping driver
out of the car.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.842
- And?
- We couldn't lift him, ma'am.

16:09.094 --> 16:11.346
- He's too heavy.
- An android?

16:11.513 --> 16:13.515
More like a statue.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.896
It hasn't moved. What is it?

16:23.400 --> 16:25.068
Get out of the car, Mr Creel.

16:48.425 --> 16:51.594
- Agent May.
- You're working for Hale?

16:51.761 --> 16:54.097
I suggest you listen
to what she has to say.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.018
She can be...

16:58.518 --> 16:59.602
persuasive.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.204
Don't beat yourself up.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.250
You did what you were told,
gave us the contact numbers,

17:22.709 --> 17:23.917
the rest is on me.

17:24.419 --> 17:27.547
- I acted too fast on the intel.
- Another trap.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.300
It feels like you'd be safer
if you just tossed me out of the plane.

17:30.467 --> 17:31.968
We should at least consider it.

17:42.479 --> 17:43.605
Agent Coulson.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.066
So good to see you again.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.323
What the hell happened?

17:53.740 --> 17:56.284
That robo-assassin burst in and shot Mack.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.621
- Yeah, but I won, though.
- Gunshot wound to the leg.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.165
- No major arteries hit.
- I'm fine.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.752
I thought you deactivated those things
before bringing them back.

18:06.294 --> 18:08.588
- It's not an anomaly?
- No, it would have disappeared.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.216
- That thing is real.
- How the hell could that have happened?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.051
How'd he get put back together?

18:13.551 --> 18:14.552
It was him.

18:15.637 --> 18:16.638
Him who?

18:17.305 --> 18:19.557
The other...

18:22.018 --> 18:24.771
The Doc...
The Doctor from the Framework.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.856
Leopold.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.360
He's here.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.949
You didn't really think you'd seen
the last of me, did you?

18:36.116 --> 18:38.243
I should've known there was more of you
out in the wind.

18:38.409 --> 18:41.079
You squash one cockroach,
there's bound to be others nearby.

18:41.246 --> 18:44.290
Although, I think you will find
I do not squash so easily these days.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.460
So much for the superior humanity shtick.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.255
I have simply redefined what that means.

18:51.089 --> 18:53.216
Parts of me will always be human.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.719
And I have gained so much more
with this new form.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.180
Strength.

19:00.348 --> 19:01.474
Immortality.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.478
How's that for a cool origin story, bro?

19:06.646 --> 19:08.606
So, what? You turned over a new leaf?

19:09.149 --> 19:11.651
Or just another Russian infiltrating
our democracy?

19:11.818 --> 19:13.278
Humanity still stands threatened.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.823
I will ensure this planet's survival
for generations.

19:17.991 --> 19:21.411
- But Hale is an important part of that.
- So, you're the one holding her leash.

19:21.578 --> 19:22.912
You will bring her to me.

19:23.580 --> 19:26.541
Or Mr Creel will blow this lovely plane
out of the sky.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.419
He and I will survive, of course, but...

19:30.587 --> 19:32.839
I'm less confident about your chances.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.011
I'm sorry. This...
This is my fault. This is my fault.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.305
But I just...
If I could've just worked out how to...

19:41.139 --> 19:44.684
shut the rift sooner,
then my greatest fear wouldn't be...

19:44.851 --> 19:46.436
Who says it's your greatest fear?

19:46.978 --> 19:49.355
Who cares whose fear it is?
What matters is stopping him.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.567
- What does he want?
- I don't... I don't know.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.819
But you do, Fitz.

19:55.195 --> 19:59.699
- He is you, so just think!
- No, I... No, I don't know.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.747
You have to try.

20:06.247 --> 20:09.042
This is our only lead
to gain some insight into...

20:09.292 --> 20:10.835
into what he might be after.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.589
He said that he wanted to...

20:15.423 --> 20:16.925
do what I was unable to do.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.803
- To finish what was started.
- What does that mean?

20:20.970 --> 20:23.473
Was he trying to bring back Aida?
Make her another body?

20:23.640 --> 20:25.975
After Ghost Rider? I don't think
there's any coming back from that.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.810
That wasn't his only operation
in the Framework.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.647
He was also in charge
of Inhuman Experimentation.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.777
That's why he sent that terminator
after Yo-Yo.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.196
Then that means he's also after...

20:38.446 --> 20:40.156
Daisy.

20:41.032 --> 20:42.075
Where is she?

20:42.367 --> 20:44.535
There was a surveillance outage
on one of the other levels.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.704
- She went to check it out.
- Okay, we have to...

20:46.955 --> 20:49.499
We have to lock down the base,
close the Doctor in.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.168
I'll find her.

21:01.219 --> 21:02.428
What the hell?

21:05.431 --> 21:07.058
There's nothing wrong with you.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.236
Okay, wild goose, one,
Daisy Johnson, zero.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.427
That moral high ground is eroding
at your feet.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.846
Utilising robots built by terrorists?

21:45.013 --> 21:46.764
You're standing next
to the man responsible

21:46.931 --> 21:49.225
- for shooting Talbot.
- Daisy Johnson shot Talbot.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.227
- I saw the tape.
- That was an android.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.771
- And programmed by him.
- He's an android programmed

21:53.938 --> 21:56.441
by Leopold Fitz. Oh, you want proof?

21:56.607 --> 21:59.027
Let's tear Anton apart limb by limb.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.904
His electronic parts look remarkably
like S.H.I.E.L.D. tech.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.865
- That's not what happened.
- What's your proof?

22:04.324 --> 22:06.242
You see how little you control?

22:07.952 --> 22:09.746
Yes, there's much to understand.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.874
But I can help you with that.

22:15.084 --> 22:18.963
- Coulson, come with me.
- He's not going anywhere.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.303
I come with you,
my people get away unharmed?

22:26.012 --> 22:27.221
I can agree to that.

22:28.556 --> 22:29.807
Excuse us.

22:37.023 --> 22:40.276
- You can't be serious, Phil.
- We've been behind her this entire time.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.195
If I can get clarity
on what we're dealing with,

22:42.362 --> 22:44.238
- then all the better!
- Oh, and we don't discuss it?

22:44.405 --> 22:47.200
- We know this is a trap, Phil.
- Yeah, and it's a really good one too.

22:47.367 --> 22:50.161
Don't do that. Not now.
Not when you're turning your back on me.

22:50.328 --> 22:51.788
Turning my back on you?

22:52.246 --> 22:53.706
What other way out is there?

22:53.915 --> 22:55.792
- This is unavoidable.
- It's suicidal,

22:56.084 --> 22:59.212
- which is now a recurring theme for you.
- I'm not airing our dirty laundry

22:59.379 --> 23:02.131
- in front of the bad guys right now.
- How considerate.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.470
He's all yours.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.150
Fitz?

23:22.652 --> 23:23.736
Oh, come on...

23:24.654 --> 23:26.614
Agent Johnson.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.327
That's not how you address
a Hydra superior.

23:34.789 --> 23:37.333
What... What...

23:37.500 --> 23:39.752
What's going on?

23:41.629 --> 23:43.506
- Escape is unlikely...
- What?

23:43.673 --> 23:45.883
...between the restraints
and the carisoprodol.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.178
Your energy would be
better spent making yourself

23:49.345 --> 23:50.847
as comfortable as possible.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.767
I'm afraid I didn't have
too many painkillers.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.272
You're not Fitz.

24:00.189 --> 24:03.359
You are another anomaly.

24:03.985 --> 24:07.655
- Where's Fitz? Where's the real Fitz?
- Oh, believe me,

24:08.197 --> 24:09.323
you're looking at him.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.952
Okay, so what is this? Uh...

24:13.953 --> 24:15.079
Is this payback?

24:15.371 --> 24:17.373
Huh? For the Framework?

24:17.832 --> 24:21.711
I know you like your Inhumans alive
when you turn them inside out.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.297
My Inhuman work...

24:25.006 --> 24:27.008
not only took threats off the streets...

24:28.468 --> 24:30.803
it deepened our understanding
of their powers.

24:31.262 --> 24:33.264
That's a Nobel Prize speech.

24:34.182 --> 24:36.434
My work helps people.

24:39.353 --> 24:41.564
Which is precisely what I'm doing now...

24:43.232 --> 24:44.692
by restoring your powers.

24:46.235 --> 24:49.113
What? No. No. No! No, no...

24:49.280 --> 24:52.283
Uh-uh. Shh! I've told you. I've told you.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.286
Try and make yourself as comfortable
as possible.

24:57.955 --> 25:01.375
No. No, you cannot. No, no!

25:09.842 --> 25:10.843
Put it on.

25:13.054 --> 25:15.431
I'll need to scan your hand, too,
for weapons.

25:15.640 --> 25:19.018
You know, somehow, this is only
the second-worst party invitation

25:19.227 --> 25:21.062
- I've ever received.
- Just put the damn hood on, Coulson.

25:21.229 --> 25:24.232
You know me, Carl. Whatever lies Hale
is selling you...

25:24.398 --> 25:26.192
Look at how he scrambles to save face.

25:26.484 --> 25:31.197
Oh. You're still here.
Hey, speaking of faces...

25:32.073 --> 25:34.742
how come your robo-warriors
don't have any?

25:35.451 --> 25:38.913
They are merely soldiers.
Tools for battle.

25:39.747 --> 25:41.624
Interesting. 'Cause, see...

25:42.416 --> 25:44.544
I think when you lost your partner Aida,

25:44.877 --> 25:47.547
you lost the ability
to make convincing LMDs.

25:48.047 --> 25:51.133
That's why Hale isn't one.
And you know what else I think?

25:52.051 --> 25:54.011
You're not the one calling the shots here.

25:54.178 --> 25:58.224
What happened, bro?
Hale must have your balls in a vice.

25:59.976 --> 26:03.354
Actually, it's his head in a jar.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.159
Please, don't do this.

26:17.451 --> 26:20.162
You know what restoring my powers
could do. You...

26:22.039 --> 26:26.043
Conversely, this rift could be
what destroys the world.

26:27.378 --> 26:30.172
- Your powers could be what save it.
- No, this...

26:31.048 --> 26:32.633
is the path to destruction.

26:33.134 --> 26:34.176
You...

26:34.635 --> 26:37.221
...are what's needed

26:37.471 --> 26:39.181
to compress the gravitonium...

26:39.849 --> 26:41.517
and insert it into the device...

26:42.435 --> 26:43.853
to shut the rift for good.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.983
My hypothesis has science to back it up.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.616
- What does yours have?
- Stop!

26:59.160 --> 27:01.495
- Fitz?
- What are you doing to her?

27:01.912 --> 27:03.956
How many times do I have to say it?

27:05.958 --> 27:07.376
What needs to be done.

27:09.045 --> 27:10.463
Mack, you need to sit down.

27:10.630 --> 27:13.507
- Take the weight off that leg.
- Not a chance.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.718
Not when more of those things
could be coming after you.

27:15.885 --> 27:17.762
Nothing's going to happen to me.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.680
You're damn right
nothing's gonna happen to you.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.516
- Not on my watch.
- No, Mack.

27:23.017 --> 27:24.393
Nothing can happen to me.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.772
What's that supposed to mean?

27:28.814 --> 27:30.024
Well, think about it.

27:31.901 --> 27:33.402
You saw me in the Lighthouse.

27:35.071 --> 27:37.073
You know I make it to that point
in the future.

27:38.324 --> 27:42.119
- Nothing can happen to me until then.
- You just lost both your arms.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.246
- That's not nothing.
- But I didn't die.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.457
The future we saw isn't guaranteed.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.959
We're actively working to make sure
it doesn't come true,

27:49.126 --> 27:50.628
but that means you could still die.

27:51.420 --> 27:52.630
I could still lose you.

27:53.714 --> 27:54.715
What then?

27:56.258 --> 27:58.135
Well, then we would've broken the loop.

28:01.180 --> 28:05.101
- Mack! You need to stay off that leg!
- I tried to tell him.

28:05.768 --> 28:07.645
Well, you just don't want
to re-aggravate that...

28:08.521 --> 28:09.563
...injury.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.735
Have Fitz or Daisy checked in yet?

28:15.111 --> 28:17.071
No, he's still out there looking for her.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.033
Stay with her.

28:26.163 --> 28:28.749
Everything's gonna be fine,
Daisy. Okay?

28:30.668 --> 28:34.505
- It will be, if you let me finish.
- You are a monster.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.049
You programmed those robots
to attack Yo-Yo,

28:37.258 --> 28:39.677
and now you've got Daisy
lying on an operating table.

28:39.844 --> 28:42.596
If the robot attacked, it must be
because it was provoked.

28:42.847 --> 28:46.517
I simply programmed it to keep Mack
and the others at bay...

28:47.518 --> 28:49.895
while I set to work
removing Daisy's inhibitor.

28:52.690 --> 28:53.733
What?

28:56.360 --> 28:59.280
Well, her powers are the missing key
to manipulating the gravitonium.

29:02.199 --> 29:05.411
- What's going on?
- There. There... Wait, stop.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.413
Just stop, stop, stop, stop.

29:07.872 --> 29:11.375
- You know that I'm right.
- No! No. Bec...

29:12.418 --> 29:15.463
Because... Because... Because I...

29:15.629 --> 29:16.839
You what?

29:17.715 --> 29:22.303
Look at you. You are weak!

29:23.220 --> 29:26.348
But together, we can fix it.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.560
- Who are you talking to?
- No.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.813
- No.
- Finish what we started.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.899
- No!
- Fitz!

29:40.946 --> 29:44.074
Simmons... help me.

29:49.038 --> 29:50.331
Put the scalpel down.

29:56.003 --> 29:57.046
Fitz?

30:00.883 --> 30:01.884
What?

30:02.676 --> 30:03.677
It's not me.

30:05.012 --> 30:06.430
It's not me, it's...

30:15.523 --> 30:17.441
He wa... He was right here.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.777
He was right...

30:24.365 --> 30:26.492
What is happening?

30:26.742 --> 30:27.785
Fitz...

30:30.371 --> 30:31.997
It wasn't an anomaly.

30:35.209 --> 30:36.460
<i>It was you.</i>

30:38.337 --> 30:41.507
<i>Programming the robots.
Keeping everyone else occupied.</i>

30:41.674 --> 30:43.968
<i>Couldn't find
any physical notes from Dr Hall.</i>

30:44.677 --> 30:47.388
- We just lost two cameras.
- That's ten levels below us.

30:47.555 --> 30:49.390
To isolate Daisy.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.645
All part of his...

30:56.522 --> 30:57.606
plan.

30:58.482 --> 30:59.692
Of my...

31:00.526 --> 31:01.569
plan.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.780
Hey, look at me.

31:08.701 --> 31:10.995
We can work all of this out.

31:11.245 --> 31:13.163
- You just need to let Daisy go.
- No.

31:15.457 --> 31:18.335
- There's no turning back.
- Of course, there is.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.170
He planned for that too.

31:28.345 --> 31:31.098
- You would point a gun at me?
- Doctor would.

31:31.265 --> 31:33.309
Programmed it to make sure
I would go through with it.

31:36.812 --> 31:39.732
He didn't want to hurt you,
just like he didn't want to hurt Mack.

31:41.150 --> 31:42.192
It's just...

31:43.986 --> 31:47.364
I wouldn't have done any of this
if I didn't believe it was gonna work.

31:47.531 --> 31:50.409
- You don't know it's going to work.
- Science is sound.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.247
There are always risks involved.

31:58.542 --> 31:59.919
You know that, Jemma.

32:00.878 --> 32:02.046
You're right...

32:02.963 --> 32:03.964
but...

32:06.342 --> 32:08.677
potentially paralysing Daisy,

32:08.844 --> 32:13.265
or destroying the world,
are two massive risks, Fitz.

32:16.393 --> 32:19.438
- Let's hope that that doesn't happen.
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no, Fitz.

32:19.605 --> 32:23.067
Fitz! Fitz! No, please, please, please!

32:23.233 --> 32:26.737
Fitz, I am begging you.
Please, you do not want to do this.

32:30.074 --> 32:31.075
No...

32:32.034 --> 32:33.077
I don't.

32:34.870 --> 32:38.999
- But I have to.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

32:59.103 --> 33:03.565
I will... I will never forgive you.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.777
I suspect you won't be the only one.

33:25.129 --> 33:27.423
The adrenaline will help jump-start
your powers.

33:31.093 --> 33:32.469
Here's what you need to do.

33:35.931 --> 33:39.560
<i>You need to compress the gravitonium down
as much as possible.</i>

33:43.439 --> 33:47.693
<i>Then carefully guide it over
and insert it into the sphere.</i>

34:58.013 --> 34:59.848
How long
have you been seeing him?

35:03.102 --> 35:04.561
My mind has been through a lot.

35:10.567 --> 35:11.985
Been hearing him for a while now.

35:12.945 --> 35:14.321
Since we left the Framework.

35:16.365 --> 35:17.825
Only just started seeing him.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.122
It's your injury acting up.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.958
You used to see me too,
when I wasn't there.

35:26.125 --> 35:27.501
You were my conscience.

35:28.627 --> 35:29.878
Then what was he?

35:38.512 --> 35:39.972
You had a psychic split.

35:40.389 --> 35:43.308
- But that dark persona, that's not you.
- It is me.

35:47.646 --> 35:48.981
It's not an apparition.

35:52.192 --> 35:54.027
It's not some evil doppelganger.

35:56.780 --> 35:57.781
It...

35:57.990 --> 35:58.991
was...

35:59.324 --> 36:00.367
me.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.877
How are Daisy and Mack?

36:11.837 --> 36:13.297
You have to talk to them.

36:14.882 --> 36:17.134
They can come to forgive you
if you just explain.

36:17.301 --> 36:19.219
I don't deserve forgiveness, Jemma.

36:24.725 --> 36:26.310
Just like you don't deserve me?

36:27.853 --> 36:29.062
Mack's injured.

36:30.272 --> 36:31.523
Daisy's traumatised.

36:33.025 --> 36:35.485
Do you know what the worst part
about all of this is?

36:38.238 --> 36:40.574
I still believe
that it was the right thing to do.

36:46.955 --> 36:48.123
And you're right.

36:52.336 --> 36:53.420
It's such a...

36:54.546 --> 36:58.133
confusing grey area, but if we are
going to change the timeline,

36:58.300 --> 37:01.970
we have to do things differently,
make harder choices.

37:07.267 --> 37:08.560
What does that make us?

37:11.230 --> 37:12.314
I don't know.

37:25.827 --> 37:27.746
I really don't know where we go from here.

37:57.693 --> 37:59.695
I don't know, really, what to say.

38:00.779 --> 38:01.989
That's a first.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.827
I guess I don't have to ask
how you're doing.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.036
I'm sorry.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.790
You didn't deserve that.
You're a victim in all of this too.

38:14.751 --> 38:17.129
I just don't...

38:18.338 --> 38:20.424
I don't really know how to process it.

38:23.385 --> 38:24.803
He's losing himself.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.681
I feel like I'm losing him, too.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.490
You haven't lost him.

38:47.034 --> 38:49.369
You know him better
than he even knows himself.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.290
He's complicated.

38:55.250 --> 38:58.837
- And he's stubborn.
- Yeah.

38:59.546 --> 39:02.132
That's why you let him
win arguments sometimes, right?

39:05.844 --> 39:09.806
He can be a real baby when he's sick,
so that's why you gotta take care of him.

39:11.767 --> 39:14.227
And he's always got the weight
of the world on his shoulders...

39:15.854 --> 39:18.357
so he needs you there
to help lighten the load.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.693
Oh, and he loves his...

39:23.612 --> 39:27.616
prosciutto and mozzarella sandwiches
that no one can make right except you.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.956
How could you possibly know
all those things?

39:39.419 --> 39:42.589
Because my mum used to tell me
about her parents all the time.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.761
She always spoke about her dad
with so much love

39:47.928 --> 39:49.679
and admiration on her face.

39:52.224 --> 39:54.351
Said he was the best man she ever knew.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.065
So, I know...

40:01.191 --> 40:02.692
that you can help Fitz.

40:06.279 --> 40:07.364
And I know...

40:09.241 --> 40:11.118
that you two are gonna be okay.

40:12.744 --> 40:13.870
Because...

40:15.789 --> 40:18.041
the steps you take don't need to be big.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.672
They just need to take you
in the right direction.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.685
You're our grandson.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.627
- Apologies for the delay.
- Still empty-handed.

41:03.503 --> 41:07.674
You see how your lack of results
could be construed as ineptitude.

41:07.841 --> 41:10.051
If you thought less of me,
I wouldn't be here.

41:10.218 --> 41:13.638
You're here
because the Confederacy allows it.

41:13.889 --> 41:15.390
You want a seat at the table?

41:15.891 --> 41:18.351
You must prove you are deserving of it.

41:20.187 --> 41:22.856
I've secured what I believe
to be the final piece.

41:23.899 --> 41:25.275
It's all within reach.

41:26.985 --> 41:30.864
- Always said prior to failure.
- No, I'd die before that happened.

41:32.199 --> 41:34.743
Well, before you do that,

41:34.910 --> 41:37.287
there's a tradition
within the Confederacy.

41:38.288 --> 41:39.998
If one faces failure...

41:41.166 --> 41:42.375
you drink the Odium.

41:44.085 --> 41:47.047
Fight your last in a wave of savage glory.

41:48.089 --> 41:51.760
But if your resolve is as strong
as you claim, you'll have no need of it.

41:53.803 --> 41:56.181
I hope fortune turns your way.

41:56.765 --> 41:57.974
And of course...

41:59.142 --> 42:00.560
Hail Hydra.
