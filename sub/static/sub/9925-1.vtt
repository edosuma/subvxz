I'M GOING TO
PULL THIS OFF.

44:49.087 --> 44:51.022

44:54.960 --> 44:56.795
OK. I HAVE REALLY
IMPORTANT NEWS.

44:56.828 --> 45:00.098
MORE IMPORTANT
THAN SAVING

45:12.043 --> 45:14.112
DIANA TO CALL
TO SEE IF YOU COULD
MOVE IT TO FRIDAY

45:14.145 --> 45:16.247
BECAUSE I HAVE
THIS PRESS THING
TO DO RIGHT NOW.

45:16.281 --> 45:17.315
WE'VE BEEN
PLANNING THIS
FOR MONTHS.

45:17.348 --> 45:20.151
I CAN'T JUST CHANGE
THE DATE TO FIT
YOUR SCHEDULE.

45:20.185 --> 45:22.788
THIS IS REALLY BAD,
ISN'T IT?

45:22.821 --> 45:23.955
YOU HAVE TO ASK?

45:23.989 --> 45:25.957
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY,

45:25.991 --> 45:27.225
BUT IT'S FOR THE BOOK,

45:27.258 --> 45:29.895
AND I HAVE A LIMO
WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE.

45:29.928 --> 45:32.397
WHATEVER.

45:48.313 --> 45:49.981
I CAN CALL THEM
AT THE RALLY.

45:50.015 --> 45:53.084
I CAN MAKE THIS WORK
FOR EVERYONE.

45:53.118 --> 45:56.054
IF I COULD ONLY FIND
MY CELL PHONE.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.957
SAWYER, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY,

45:58.990 --> 46:00.792
BUT I REALLY
SHOULD BE THERE.

46:00.826 --> 46:02.961
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING LATER?

46:02.994 --> 46:04.930
I'M TAPING A SEGMENT
OF RISE AND SHINE.

46:04.963 --> 46:07.398
TOTALLY LAME,
BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO?

46:07.432 --> 46:08.934
ANYWAY, DO YOU WANT
TO GRAB A BITE
TO EAT LATER?

46:08.967 --> 46:10.201
ANYTHING
BUT PIZZA, EW!

46:10.235 --> 46:11.903
CAN'T STAND
THE STUFF.

46:11.937 --> 46:13.504
HELLO.

46:13.538 --> 46:14.539
HEY, THAT IS MY PHONE.

46:14.572 --> 46:15.974
WELL, YOU WEREN'T
GONNA USE IT

46:16.007 --> 46:16.942
FOR ANYTHING IMPORTANT.

46:16.975 --> 46:18.977
I LOVE PIZZA.

46:19.010 --> 46:19.945
AND LINDSAY IS MY FRIEND.

46:19.978 --> 46:22.981
LINDSAY ISN'T GOING
TOO MAKE YOU A SUPERSTAR.

46:23.014 --> 46:25.216
MAYBE I DON'T WANT
TO BE A SUPERSTAR.

46:25.250 --> 46:27.986
"I DON'T WANT TO BE
A SUPERSTAR.

46:28.019 --> 46:30.088
I LOVE PIZZA."

46:30.121 --> 46:31.923
WELL, I SUPPOSE
YOU DIDN'T WANT

46:31.957 --> 46:32.924
THE CUTEST BOY IN SCHOOL

46:32.958 --> 46:34.225
TO ASK YOU
TO THE DANCE EITHER.

46:34.259 --> 46:35.060
WELL...

46:35.093 --> 46:37.896
STOP WHINING AND START
ACTING LIKE IS.

46:39.064 --> 46:40.365

46:40.398 --> 46:41.466
SO, YOU READY?

46:41.499 --> 46:43.334
COME ON.

46:43.368 --> 46:44.936
UH...

46:44.970 --> 46:46.972
IN A SOCIETY
SUCH AS OURS,

46:47.005 --> 46:50.041
IT IS INDEFENSIBLE
TO TREAT SMALL,
LITTLE CREATURES,

46:50.075 --> 46:52.410
SUCH AS THE BUNNY,
IN UNCARING WAYS.

46:52.443 --> 46:54.012
THEY HAVE ANIMAL TESTING...

46:54.045 --> 46:55.280
YOU WANT TO SIGN
OUR PETITION?

46:55.313 --> 46:58.416
NO. I WANT TO FIND
THE BATHROOM.

46:58.449 --> 47:01.920
UH-HUH. AROUND THE CORNER
TO THE LEFT.

47:05.123 --> 47:08.994
THIS PROTEST
IS A COMPLETE DISASTER.

47:09.027 --> 47:10.962
NOW THE BUNNIES
ARE GONNA PAY FOR IT.

47:10.996 --> 47:13.631
IT'S NOT OUR FAULT
THAT OUR
CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENT

47:13.664 --> 47:15.233
PULLED OUT
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

47:15.266 --> 47:18.870
NO. IT'S HER
HANDLER'S FAULT.

47:19.270 --> 47:22.507
I LIKED HER BETTER
WHEN SHE DIDN'T
HAVE A HANDLER.

47:22.540 --> 47:25.010
ME, TOO.

47:28.346 --> 47:31.216
IN 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

47:31.249 --> 47:33.051
HELLO,

TO BE HERE.

47:41.626 --> 47:44.395
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO GO FROM
HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN

47:44.429 --> 47:46.031

47:46.697 --> 47:49.034
WELL, THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF

47:49.067 --> 47:49.935
STRANGE THINGS
HAPPENING TO ME,

47:49.968 --> 47:52.237
BUT AFTER AWHILE,
YOU JUST GET USED TO IT.

47:52.270 --> 47:54.973
WE'VE BEEN TOLD
THAT YOUR BOOK,

47:55.006 --> 47:56.107
"IS SAVES THE WORLD,"

47:56.141 --> 47:58.209

A LOT OF BOOKS.

48:10.088 --> 48:11.289
IT'S IN
ITS SECOND PRINTING.

48:11.322 --> 48:13.324
WOW, DID YOU EVER THINK
IT WOULD DO SO WELL?

48:13.358 --> 48:17.262
WELL, AS I WAS WRITING
"IS SAVES THE WORLD,"

48:17.295 --> 48:20.031
I FELT AS IF I HAD
TAPPED INTO SOMETHING

48:20.065 --> 48:21.066
BIGGER THAN MYSELF.

48:21.099 --> 48:23.201
AND THIS IS JUST
THE BEGINNING.

WHEN I'M WORKING
ON OUR MASTERPIECE.

59:22.627 --> 59:24.962
YEAH. I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD STUFF

59:24.995 --> 59:26.296

OF SOMETHING A LITTLE
MORE PROACTIVE.

59:49.119 --> 59:50.755
I KNOW THIS WHALE
MEANS A LOT TO YOU,

59:50.788 --> 59:53.123

AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY

59:53.157 --> 59:54.091

GIVE THE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT.

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:13.043
YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM
WHAT THEY WANT.

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:14.344

01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:15.913
WAS THAT A YES?

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.615
