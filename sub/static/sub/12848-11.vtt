WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:03.235
* I want to realize *

00:03.237 --> 00:04.703
tell me real quick
before he comes back.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.138
How'd you meet this new guy?

00:06.140 --> 00:07.740
In line at the grocery store.

00:07.742 --> 00:11.010
Oh!
Very 1950s housewife of you.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.044
Yeah.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.512
Well, he seems like a nice guy.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.749
Yeah, you know, so far so good,
which I needed right now.

00:16.751 --> 00:18.550
Just... Normal.

00:19.754 --> 00:21.053
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.087
Are you okay?

00:22.089 --> 00:23.789
Yeah.
It's just hot today.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.758
Actually, it's...
It's unseasonably cool

00:25.760 --> 00:27.760
for summer in San Antonio,
I thought.

00:27.762 --> 00:30.095
Oh, it must just be me then.

00:30.097 --> 00:32.497
So, how long have
you and Shannon been together?

00:32.500 --> 00:33.665
- Oh, uh, well...
- Nope.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.535
We're not "together".
We don't use labels.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.805
Well, uh... well, labels are
there for a reason, you know?

00:39.807 --> 00:42.207
I mean... I mean, how do you
define together, Matt?

00:42.209 --> 00:44.376
You know, I-i think
that there is together, right?

00:44.378 --> 00:46.245
And then there's <i> together,</i>
right?

00:46.247 --> 00:48.080
And... and... and so...

00:48.082 --> 00:50.282
Are you sure you're okay?
'Cause you're sweating a lot.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.750
Yeah, I'm good.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.452
Yeah?

00:53.453 --> 00:55.153
Matt. Matt?

00:55.156 --> 00:56.755
Oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:56.757 --> 00:57.790
Oh!

00:57.792 --> 00:59.224
What the hell?

01:01.062 --> 01:03.095
Okay, I need you
to help move furniture.

01:03.097 --> 01:05.564
I'll call 911
and meet the ambulance.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.633
Oh, he has
a punctured femoral artery.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.334
All right, I want you
to cut the straps on my purse.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.696
We're gonna use it
as a tourniquet.

01:11.672 --> 01:12.805
Right there.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.080
He's still bleeding.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.448
All right, let's roll him over.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.119
Great, he's got a puncture
in his butt.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.854
We can't tourniquet it.
W-what do we do?

01:28.856 --> 01:31.256
I have to occlude the artery
with my finger.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.425
This date
just keeps getting better.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.094
<i>Touchdown.</i>

01:35.096 --> 01:37.863
Yeah!
There we go!

01:37.865 --> 01:39.985
Nice to hang out with you.
Haven't done it in a while.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.103
Oh, hang on.

01:44.105 --> 01:47.272
It's Syd. She's in town
signing her discharge papers.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.708
She's gonna drop off a letter
of recommendation later tonight

01:49.710 --> 01:51.610
- for Brianna's social worker.
- Right.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.579
You?

01:53.580 --> 01:55.547
Uh, hospital sale...
That's a kick in the nuts, huh?

01:55.549 --> 01:56.882
Right?

01:56.884 --> 01:59.118
- Jessica.
- Yeah.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.752
I did not see that coming.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.322
Just shows you
not to trust women, huh?

02:03.324 --> 02:05.157
Maybe just not <i> that</i> woman.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.626
I wouldn't slam the entire gender...
Then Annie tells me today

02:07.628 --> 02:10.496
that she's thinking
of moving in with Scott.

02:10.497 --> 02:11.897
Scott.
Can you believe that?

02:11.899 --> 02:13.765
- Like,<i> Scott,</i> Scott.
- Yeah.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.368
So, to summarize,
betrayed by a girlfriend,

02:16.370 --> 02:19.138
Annie ditching me,
and E.R. being sold.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.139
Thank you.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.908
- Hey, get a...
- Coming up.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.877
Thought you cut down
on the drinking.

02:24.879 --> 02:26.545
- Yeah, I was.
- Right.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.313
And look where it got me.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.848
Yeah.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.350
Uh, you know what?
I'm gonna go.

02:31.351 --> 02:32.851
I want to see Brianna
before she falls asleep.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.820
- Yeah.
- We're gonna talk, okay?

02:34.822 --> 02:35.888
Later.

02:35.890 --> 02:38.457
- Take an uber home.
- Okay.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.626
You can... you can just...
You can have this seat here

02:40.628 --> 02:41.894
- if you want.
- Thank you.

02:41.896 --> 02:43.428
You hitting on my girl?

02:43.430 --> 02:45.664
Trust me,
I'm not hitting on your girl.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.332
Okay?
Oh, so you're saying she's ugly.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.401
No. I just offered her my chair.
Brian.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.569
All right?
Everything's cool, man.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.921
- Come on, baby.
- Just... it's okay.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.272
That's right, you better leave,
little bitch.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.240
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- No. No, t.

02:55.242 --> 02:57.809
- W-what did you call my friend?
- I said he's a little bitch.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.678
Let it go.
T, come on! T!

03:04.618 --> 03:07.519
You need to stay focused
on shadowing Kenny tonight.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.354
First step
back towards nursing school.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.822
I'm really proud of you.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.224
Thank you. I'm excited.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.525
I'm a little distracted.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.960
I had kind of a rough start
to the night.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.528
- What?
- But, um...

03:16.530 --> 03:17.763
I just... I told T.C.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.598
That we were talking about
moving in together.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.966
He did not take it well.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.635
Oh.
You told him that?

03:23.637 --> 03:26.338
I mean, I know we...
We talked about it one time,

03:26.340 --> 03:28.907
but we hadn't decided anything
about it.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.375
Oh. Okay.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.312
I mean, doesn't it...
Doesn't it seem fast?

03:33.314 --> 03:35.847
Y... I know we had that moment
where we were lying in bed

03:35.849 --> 03:37.883
and we were talking to each
other about "what if?" But...

03:37.885 --> 03:39.451
Yeah. No. You know what?
I jumped the gun.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.485
Just forget I said anything.

03:40.487 --> 03:41.553
- Well, Annie...
- Incoming.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.555
There's my boss.
I better go.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.856
Annie, first patient's up.
Let's go.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.341
- I'm ready.
- What do we got?

03:46.342 --> 03:47.825
Female, late 20s.
She's tachy with a stable BP.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.461
Patient lost control of her
bicycle and fell on her chin,

03:49.463 --> 03:50.495
bit her tongue.
Okay. Trauma one.

03:50.497 --> 03:51.730
She's choking on her blood.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.969
Can't find the cut
with all this blood.

03:56.971 --> 03:59.271
- More suction, Kenny.
- On it.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.241
Hold it. Hold it.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.542
She's not choking on blood.

04:03.543 --> 04:04.842
There's something
in the back of her throat.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.011
Magill forceps.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:15.456 --> 04:16.988
- What is that?
- It's a piece of food.

04:16.991 --> 04:18.790
Okay.

04:18.791 --> 04:19.958
Let's set up to suture her chin.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.959
I'll get the kit.

04:24.031 --> 04:27.532
I thought I got it all.
Hey! Guys!

04:27.534 --> 04:28.934
- Wait. Annie?
- On it.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.273
What do you see?

04:34.842 --> 04:37.209
Nothing.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.577
That's a problem.
There's nothing in there.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.413
Hey.
What do you got?

04:41.415 --> 04:43.649
Uh, male, 42.
Status post syncopal fall

04:43.651 --> 04:45.050
with multiple lacs
from broken glass.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.052
He's got a punctured femoral
and sacral artery.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.754
- BP is in the 90s.
- All right.

04:48.756 --> 04:49.955
I'll stitch him up
in trauma two,

04:49.957 --> 04:51.590
then send him up
for an angiogram

04:51.592 --> 04:53.025
to see if he needs more surgery.

04:53.027 --> 04:54.493
Uh, no, Paul...
He can do it.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.061
He's right behind me
with Shannon.

04:56.063 --> 04:59.298
- What, were you guys...
- Hanging out.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.066
So, where'd he come from?

05:01.969 --> 05:03.769
We were on a double date.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.871
And now you got your finger
in his butt cheek.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.005
This should be interesting.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.307
Shut up.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.994
There wasn't any other food
in your throat,

05:28.996 --> 05:31.697
so we need to figure out
what's been causing you to gag.

05:31.699 --> 05:34.366
- Has this happened before?
- Yeah, a lot lately.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.600
That's why I fell off my bike.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.369
I-I was riding
in Brackenridge park,

05:37.371 --> 05:41.006
and I took a bite of a power bar
and started choking...

05:41.008 --> 05:43.508
And just lost control
of my bike.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.776
I just...
I-I've been having trouble

05:44.778 --> 05:45.977
keeping food down lately.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.746
You look a little thin, Dana.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.481
Is there something else
going on?

05:49.483 --> 05:50.682
Here we go.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.017
You think I have
an eating disorder

05:52.019 --> 05:53.819
like all the other doctors.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.687
- What other doctors?
- All of them.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.988
I've been to so many,
I've lost count.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.524
I'm... I'm not purposely
starving myself.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.526
I just... I can't eat.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.028
Are you on
any medications for it?

06:03.030 --> 06:04.730
You seem a little anxious.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.265
I took Xanax,

06:06.266 --> 06:07.799
but that zonked me out,
so I stopped doing that.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.134
I went holistic.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.870
I have tried yoga,
meditation, exercise.

06:11.872 --> 06:15.774
I mean, I even went to Peru
to see a shaman.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.744
Took ayahuasca
and went on a vision quest.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.880
Wow. I-i, uh, would not
have recommended that.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.849
The ayahuasca made me puke
for three days,

06:23.851 --> 06:27.619
and I feel like I haven't
stopped since I got back.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.788
I mean, this has ruined my life.

06:29.790 --> 06:33.458
So if you're finished,
I just... I really...

06:33.460 --> 06:35.127
I just want to go home
to my dog.

06:35.129 --> 06:37.562
Yeah. I'm, uh...

06:37.564 --> 06:39.564
I'm gonna give you
a shot of a strong antacid

06:39.566 --> 06:41.533
in case this is from reflux.

06:41.535 --> 06:45.570
And then I'll look through
your chart.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.572
Topher,

06:47.574 --> 06:48.807
can I talk to you for a second?

06:48.809 --> 06:50.569
I don't have anything
to say to you, Lucifer.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.880
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

06:54.882 --> 06:56.815
I'm on your side.
I'm trying to help you.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.217
By secretly working

06:58.218 --> 06:59.618
for the company
that's gonna fire everybody.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.986
You might want
to rethink that strategy.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.754
You were going
to get fired anyway, okay?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.055
I didn't have anything
to do with that.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.157
I gave you the heads-up.

07:05.159 --> 07:06.625
You gave them all our secrets.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.627
Now they may fire everybody.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.633
Is T.C. okay?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.601
You should ask him.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.104
He won't answer any of my calls.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.839
Good for him.
Now if you'll excuse me,

07:20.841 --> 07:22.174
I need to take care
of my patient

07:22.176 --> 07:25.043
while I still have a job here.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.845
Mollie, I'm gonna need an office
after my meeting.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.613
Can you help me, please?

07:28.615 --> 07:31.917
After what you did to Topher,
try the local Starbucks.

07:31.919 --> 07:32.984
Bye, Felicia.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.189
I hate her.

07:37.191 --> 07:39.157
Any news on what Hobart's
going to do yet?

07:39.159 --> 07:40.625
Besides replacing Topher,

07:40.627 --> 07:42.761
I heard they're gonna
turn this place into an HMO.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.496
Are the nurses safe?

07:44.498 --> 07:45.831
We got a union.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.736
Hey.

07:51.738 --> 07:55.173
So, this guy went on a date
with you while he was high.

07:56.626 --> 07:58.076
Yeah, we need to get
a tox screen on him.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.878
- Yes, doctor.
- Thank you.

08:02.115 --> 08:05.050
Yeah, Shannon seems to think
that he's on Molly.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.719
Molly.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.488
Well, you know,
Molly isn't the pure mdma

08:09.490 --> 08:11.490
that all the kids think it is,
right?

08:11.492 --> 08:12.891
It's cut
with all kinds of stuff...

08:12.893 --> 08:15.927
Aspirin, bath salts...
Cocaine.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.796
Exactly, so he could be having
an adverse reaction

08:17.798 --> 08:19.198
to any number of those things.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.919
And we don't know
when he took what he took?

08:21.969 --> 08:23.902
I really know how to pick 'em.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.771
I mean, h-he just seemed
so normal, you know?

08:26.773 --> 08:28.840
Well, just because
he took Molly on a date

08:28.842 --> 08:30.909
doesn't make him not normal.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.712
I mean, I'm not saying
it bodes well

08:33.714 --> 08:35.212
for the future
of your relationship.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.815
But...

08:36.817 --> 08:38.884
- No.
- Jordan,

08:38.885 --> 08:40.952
do you need help with anything?
Kenny asked me to check in.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.554
Annie, uh, I'm sorry.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.155
I forgot that you were
shadowing here now.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.190
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.558
Do you need anything?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.159
Uh, yeah, actually,
you can help us out.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.928
We need an emergency contact
for this patient.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.296
Can you maybe
go through his phone

08:51.298 --> 08:53.532
and see if you can find someone
in his social circle

08:53.534 --> 08:54.633
who can answer questions?

08:54.635 --> 08:55.867
Yeah, I'd be glad to do it.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.136
Thank you.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.838
That was uncomfortable.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.072
Scissors.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.642
You didn't tell her about...

09:03.644 --> 09:05.844
They found a match for Brianna.
Lungs are on the way.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.379
- Finally.
- That's great.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.913
Let's get the O.R. prepped
and get Brianna ready.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.182
Yeah, no, you should go.
Um, I can take care of this.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.118
Paul, go find drew
and see if he's checked in yet.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.986
Yeah.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.571
Nothing still?

09:32.573 --> 09:34.339
I'm gonna kill drew.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.840
I'll go up and sit with Bri.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.909
Here, I'll keep trying.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.977
Whoa. Your patient's had nine
GI work-ups. What's the deal?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.680
Stomach cramping, vomiting.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.882
Choking and gagging
almost nonstop.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.217
Look at her history.
Tell me what <i> you</i> see.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.186
Just had a CT
a couple weeks ago.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.721
Totally normal.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.540
All her blood tests,
including markers

09:51.541 --> 09:53.358
for celiac and crohn's disease,
are normal.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.760
- Severe gerd?
- Maybe.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.195
W-what does
her endoscopy show?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.663
Mm, never had one.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.131
Looks like it was ordered
a couple times,

10:00.133 --> 10:01.733
but insurance wouldn't cover it.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.001
The GI consults all say

10:03.003 --> 10:06.004
her symptoms are
"likely psychosomatic."

10:06.006 --> 10:09.708
Well, anxiety can wreak havoc
on the body.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.077
Once she gets that
under control,

10:12.079 --> 10:15.280
I'm sure her GI symptoms
will miraculously go away.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.915
I'm gonna discharge her.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.750
- Start the paperwork, okay?
- But...

10:18.752 --> 10:19.951
Hey, uh, Topher?

10:19.953 --> 10:22.053
Can I just say something?

10:22.055 --> 10:24.823
It's not really like you
to just dismiss someone as nuts.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.658
I'm not, Shannon.
I'm looking at her history.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.360
- I'm going by what I see.
- And so am I.

10:28.362 --> 10:30.662
You're the one who told me
you have to find a way

10:30.664 --> 10:32.964
to emotionally connect
with the patient.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.399
You're being like
all those other doctors.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.101
You're not listening to her.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.303
If we all did that, we'd all be
really sucky doctors...

10:38.305 --> 10:40.405
Uh, not that you're
a sucky doctor,

10:40.407 --> 10:43.942
because you are not, boss man.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.110
You're right.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.012
I'm, uh...
I'm in a pissy mood,

10:47.014 --> 10:48.346
and I'm letting it
cloud my judgment.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.649
Let's do the endoscopy.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.951
We'll label it as emergent so
the insurance doesn't flag it.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.120
Yeah!
Screw the corporation.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.138
You've never done an endo.

10:56.139 --> 10:57.155
- No.
- Come... come join me.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.124
- Absolutely.
- Hey, Shannon.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.358
Hey, I'll be right there.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.327
You were right.
He's on Molly.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.795
Right there.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.130
Silver lining...

11:05.132 --> 11:06.898
Your date's got
a good drug dealer.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.667
- It was the pure stuff.
- Comforting.

11:08.669 --> 11:12.103
I swear, I thought
he was just normal, you know?

11:12.105 --> 11:14.005
That's what I liked about him.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.174
Excuse me?
Excuse me.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.009
Oh, hey.
You're Jordan, right?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.377
- Yeah.
- Just got a phone call

11:19.379 --> 11:21.379
about Matt being brought
to the E.R. is he okay?

11:21.381 --> 11:23.281
I'm sorry. What is your
relationship to the patient?

11:23.283 --> 11:26.084
I'm Cristina, his wife.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.986
His wife?

11:30.257 --> 11:31.923
Why?

11:31.925 --> 11:34.009
Why you got to start a fight?

11:34.010 --> 11:36.094
'Cause the guy got in your face
and called you a little bitch.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.080
He needed his ass handed to him.

11:38.081 --> 11:40.065
So what? Who cares what
some drunk prick has to say?

11:40.067 --> 11:42.133
Now because you got to prove
what a man you are,

11:42.135 --> 11:45.103
I'm stuck in here,
missing my shift and Brianna.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.139
Hey, can I get
my phone call now?!

11:48.141 --> 11:50.709
Hey, I'm a doctor.
I got to call in to work.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.010
Drew, you're very loud.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.078
Anybody?!

11:58.885 --> 12:00.385
Uh, so, you're in
an open marriage?

12:00.387 --> 12:03.455
Actually, we like
to call ourselves polyamorous.

12:03.457 --> 12:05.990
Okay, which means what, exactly?

12:05.992 --> 12:07.859
We're involved
with more than one person

12:07.861 --> 12:11.896
in a romantic, sexual,
and loving relationship.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.499
Whoa. Sorry.
Uh, that sounded personal.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.901
Oh, no, it's okay.
I have no secrets.

12:16.903 --> 12:20.038
Um Cristina,
this is Dr. Clemmens.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.340
He sewed up Matt's wounds.

12:22.342 --> 12:26.044
Cristina is Matt's wife.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.279
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.983
So, I reviewed Matt's angiogram,
and it looks like

12:31.985 --> 12:34.786
he doesn't need any more
surgery, which is great.

12:34.788 --> 12:37.222
Looks like
Dr. Alexander's quick thinking

12:37.224 --> 12:38.389
probably saved his life.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.125
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.359
It's fine.

12:42.829 --> 12:45.163
All right. Um...

12:45.165 --> 12:46.331
Nice to meet you.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.932
Dr. Alexander,
if you need me,

12:47.934 --> 12:50.001
I'll be charting
at the nurses' station.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.306
I'm sorry,

12:55.308 --> 12:57.942
but did Matt tell you
that he was seeing me?

12:57.944 --> 12:59.194
Of course. Yeah.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.445
He... he told me
when he met you.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.881
He even showed me
your Facebook profile.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.016
You seemed lovely,
so I gave him my blessing.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.585
Okay, that's nice,

13:06.586 --> 13:08.153
but, Cristina,
he didn't tell me about you.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.922
I know. And you should know
that is not how we operate.

13:10.924 --> 13:13.958
I'm... Pretty upset
with Matt right now.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.960
I mean, he should've been honest
with you, Jordan.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.929
We put all our cards
on the table.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.832
Did you know
that he was using Molly?

13:20.834 --> 13:22.400
I suspected something.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.002
He's been seeing
a much younger woman

13:24.004 --> 13:27.038
who's a little too wild
for my taste.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.941
They went to an EDM concert
last night.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.177
I think it's time for him
to break things off with her.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.913
That's why I was hoping
things worked out with you.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.882
Okay. I have to, uh...

13:37.884 --> 13:39.951
I have to go out that door.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.957
His wife?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.892
I'm not talking about this
with you.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.294
In fact, I'm not gonna
talk about it

13:49.296 --> 13:52.230
with anybody on this planet
or in this galaxy...

13:52.232 --> 13:54.065
- Ever.
- Polyamory.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.100
You think you'll give it a...
Give <i> them</i> a go?

13:56.102 --> 13:57.468
You're really enjoying this,
aren't you?

13:57.470 --> 13:59.137
Yeah. I really am.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.041
Okay, well, speaking of
uncomfortable dating situations,

14:03.043 --> 14:05.076
um...

14:05.078 --> 14:07.011
Did you tell Annie
about our kiss?

14:07.013 --> 14:08.980
See, look.
Now your smile is gone.

14:08.982 --> 14:12.050
I don't see the point
of drudging something up

14:12.052 --> 14:13.484
that's just gonna
hurt her feelings.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.486
It was a long, emotional night.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.021
We said a lot of stuff
to each other,

14:17.023 --> 14:20.491
and it just... Happened
in the moment.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.060
Yeah, you know, I know.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.895
And, look, whether or not
you decide to tell Annie,

14:23.897 --> 14:25.997
that's obviously your business.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.098
But just take a page
from my friends in trauma two...

14:28.101 --> 14:29.634
It is never a good idea
to keep secrets.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.870
Dr. Clemmens,
the transplant team said

14:31.872 --> 14:33.404
they'd be ready for you
in 15 minutes.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.040
- Anybody hear from drew?
- No, and we can't find T.C.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.342
Kenny sent the paramedics

14:37.344 --> 14:39.344
over to T.C.'s apartment
just in case.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.145
No one was there.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.481
Okay, I will call
some of his motorcycle buddies

14:43.483 --> 14:44.883
to see if we can find him.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.018
Officer,
I want my phone call now.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.386
- Few minutes.
- No. "Few minutes"?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.121
You that said 20 minutes ago.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.891
Drew, take it easy.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.993
- Don't tell me to...
- The more you bug them,

14:54.995 --> 14:56.361
the longer
they'll make you wait.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.597
Drunk tank rules, all right?

14:59.599 --> 15:01.499
Don't piss off the cops,

15:01.501 --> 15:05.503
forget about time,
and try to make friends.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.038
Luckily for us,

15:07.040 --> 15:09.307
we don't have to worry
about the making friends part.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.110
This doesn't bother you?

15:12.112 --> 15:14.479
- I've been here before.
- And you're proud of that?

15:14.481 --> 15:17.148
Just stating a fact.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.150
Yelling at the cops
just makes it worse.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.552
I've never missed a day's work.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.554
I made a commitment to Brianna.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.623
I read to her every night
before she falls sleep, t.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.358
- This is your fault.
- Yeah, okay, next time,

15:27.360 --> 15:28.993
I just won't have your back,
all right?

15:28.995 --> 15:30.662
Is that what you think
you were doing, t?

15:30.664 --> 15:32.096
- Yes.
- 'Cause what you don't get

15:32.098 --> 15:33.531
is I had it,

15:33.533 --> 15:36.000
by choosing to be the bigger man
and walking away.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.669
I like to fight, t.

15:37.671 --> 15:40.171
But in the octagon,
not in the bar.

15:40.173 --> 15:43.174
That I'll leave to the drunk,
loudmouth wannabe.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.676
Oh, tell me more,
Dr. Freud.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.444
You want more? I got more.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.146
You're a mess, and you're
screwing everything up.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.381
And over what?
Over... over a breakup?

15:50.383 --> 15:53.184
Or over Annie moving out?
What... what is it?

15:53.186 --> 15:54.953
Because you're starting to act
like you used to.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.321
You're like, "hey, everybody,
look at me."

15:56.323 --> 15:58.089
I'm just gonna drink,
and I'm gonna fight,

15:58.091 --> 15:59.708
"because I can't
face my problems."

15:59.709 --> 16:01.326
Says the guy who spent
20 years in the closet.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.261
You shut your mouth.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.503
'Cause I'm getting tired of it.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.970
Can I have my phone call,
please?!

16:11.972 --> 16:14.038
Jordan, you got a second?

16:14.040 --> 16:15.606
Yeah... a second.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.976
I assume you hate me
like everybody else here?

16:17.978 --> 16:19.610
Hate is a strong word,

16:19.612 --> 16:22.046
but no, I am definitely not
your biggest fan.

16:22.048 --> 16:26.250
I couldn't tell anyone
what was going on, okay?

16:26.252 --> 16:28.486
I really need this job, and this
was gonna happen anyway.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.154
The place has been in the red
for years.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.190
- That's why it's being sold.
- That may be,

16:32.192 --> 16:34.993
but you can't blame everyone
here for being angry with you.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.795
And, look, we all love Topher,

16:36.796 --> 16:38.596
so if you mess with him,
you're messing with all of us.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.198
- Thank you.
- Look, I know.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.600
I'm trying to help him
keep his job.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.602
I have a few ideas,
but he won't even talk to me.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.688
Neither will T.C.,
for that matter.

16:46.689 --> 16:48.773
- Any ideas on how to make good with him?
- Yeah, you can just stop,

16:48.775 --> 16:52.043
because once that man makes up
his mind, he doesn't change it.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.212
Look, Jessica.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.680
Are the rumors true?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.448
Okay, are you guys really
gonna sell off this E.R.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.017
And turn it into
a surgical center?

16:59.019 --> 17:00.118
I mean,
is that what's happening?

17:00.120 --> 17:03.254
I'm not allowed
to say... Legally.

17:07.060 --> 17:10.528
If you have a résumé,
I would update it if I were you.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.269
Dana's esophagus
is completely normal.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.203
So why can't she eat?

17:19.204 --> 17:21.271
I'm stumped.

17:21.273 --> 17:26.044
I don't want to believe it,
but maybe it is all in her head.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.579
Hey, uh, Jordan, you want
to take a look at this?

17:28.581 --> 17:29.580
Need your input.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.382
Yeah.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.752
And I need to talk to you about
what I just heard from Jessica.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.054
Great. Can't wait.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.355
Jordan! Trauma two!

17:43.463 --> 17:45.496
What's happening?
What's wrong with him?

17:45.498 --> 17:46.798
He's seizing.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.399
Okay, push a milligram
of Ativan.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.567
Get him on high-flow oxygen.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.668
What is that?
What...

17:53.273 --> 17:56.240
Matt.
Matt, honey, please.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.276
Make it stop.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.243
Meds are in.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.611
Why isn't it working?

18:02.248 --> 18:03.614
Push another milligram.

18:08.822 --> 18:11.422
Since when do you smoke?

18:11.424 --> 18:14.158
Nervous habit.
Trying not to start again.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.260
T.C.'s not answering
any of my messages.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.229
I-I'm worried.

18:18.231 --> 18:21.265
Is that all this is about?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.468
Not our moving-in
conversation?

18:23.470 --> 18:27.138
I feel like I opened my big
mouth, and I scared you off.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.307
No, you didn't.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.842
You didn't scare me off.

18:30.844 --> 18:34.245
I think maybe I scared
<i>myself</i> off a little.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.280
What does that mean?

18:38.518 --> 18:41.752
Well, we've just been moving
really fast,

18:41.754 --> 18:43.454
so fast.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.756
I mean, we're not even
supposed to be dating each other

18:45.758 --> 18:47.391
as far as the program goes.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.262
And so... I think maybe

18:51.264 --> 18:53.331
because of all of that,

18:53.333 --> 18:55.199
I did something.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.767
Did what?

18:58.438 --> 19:01.139
Jordan and I kissed.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.507
What?

19:02.509 --> 19:03.808
It was just something that

19:03.810 --> 19:06.544
it just kind of happened
in a moment.

19:06.546 --> 19:10.348
How does that just happen
in a moment?

19:12.352 --> 19:14.285
Oh, hey!
Guys, hang on one quick second.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.820
That's the transplant team
with Brianna's lung.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.388
I got to go.
I'm sorry.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.890
I know this is a crappy place
to leave it,

19:18.892 --> 19:20.691
but I swear
we'll talk more later.

19:20.693 --> 19:23.394
We're going up to peds ICU.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.172
The donor lung is here.
It's go time.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.373
Is drew here?

19:35.375 --> 19:37.308
We're still looking for him,
sweetheart.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.343
No, I'm not gonna do
the surgery without him.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.379
We can't wait anymore, Brianna.
Please don't make me.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.181
Brianna, we need to get you
up to the O.R.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.882
No. No. No! No!

19:44.884 --> 19:46.417
Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy.
Hey. Oh. Oh.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.585
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hold her down.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.253
Please don't. No.

19:49.255 --> 19:50.488
Kenny, two of haldol IV.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.889
Let me go.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.425
You'll be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.187
It's gonna be okay.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.466
Matt! Matt!

20:02.468 --> 20:03.568
I'm bolusing Keppra.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.570
Dilantin is running in
right now.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.505
I'm gonna check the labs.

20:07.507 --> 20:08.739
- Why won't it stop?
- I'm not sure.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.808
Something should be working.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.876
He was drinking a lot of water.
Uh, it could be hyponatremia.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.712
- What is that?
- It means his blood is diluted

20:14.714 --> 20:17.215
from too much water, and his
sodium levels are too low.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.649
So give him sodium, then.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.484
I can't do anything
until I know his levels,

20:20.486 --> 20:21.919
and his chemistry isn't back
from the lab.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.888
He would need 3%
sodium chloride.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.873
But if I give it to him

20:25.874 --> 20:27.857
and his levels are already too
high, his brain could swell.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.427
He could die.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.561
Chemistry machine
is being serviced.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.896
That's why the labs
aren't back yet.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.264
They're down for another hour.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.666
We don't have an hour.

20:35.668 --> 20:38.669
Cristina, ongoing seizing
can cause brain damage.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.555
I'm sorry.
What do you want to do?

20:40.556 --> 20:42.440
Jordan, I love him. Please,
you have to do something.

20:42.442 --> 20:45.009
BP's increasing, doctor.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.678
Push 100 cc
of 3% sodium chloride.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.680
- Are you sure?
- I have no choice.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.315
I have to trust my gut.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.354
Sweetie, they're waiting for us,

20:56.356 --> 20:58.723
and we're running out of time.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.362
Hey, Brianna?

21:04.364 --> 21:07.598
I know that I'm not drew,
but I care about you.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.617
I'm not gonna leave your side,

21:09.618 --> 21:11.635
and I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.971
Neither will Nina
or Kenny or Scott.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.642
All right?

21:21.381 --> 21:23.648
Hey, Brianna,
they... they found drew, okay?

21:23.650 --> 21:24.882
He's on his way.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.585
Uh, he... he says
that he loves you

21:27.587 --> 21:30.021
and he's gonna be here
when you wake up, all right?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.625
Okay.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.595
Brianna?

21:37.597 --> 21:38.763
- Damn it.
- What... what is happening?

21:38.765 --> 21:40.364
- She's crashing.
- We need to intubate.

21:40.366 --> 21:41.666
Tell the O.R.
we'll be there in five.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.334
Yes, doctor.

21:45.438 --> 21:46.438
Clear.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.742
The endoscopy didn't show any
problems with your esophagus.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.544
We checked all your records.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.314
We can't find any medical reason
for your eating issue.

21:56.316 --> 21:59.750
Why is this happening to me?

21:59.752 --> 22:02.320
My stomach pains
are getting worse.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.688
And I can't eat anything.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.424
And I just... I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

22:06.426 --> 22:09.093
And I-i don't have anyone
to h-help me.

22:09.095 --> 22:12.596
<i>We're</i> here to help you, okay?

22:12.598 --> 22:14.598
We just... we just need
to find the right meds...

22:14.600 --> 22:16.400
I don't want any meds.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.669
Hey, Dana, I don't know
what it's like

22:18.671 --> 22:21.439
to feel sick all the time,
but I do know what it's like

22:21.441 --> 22:24.108
not being able to deal with
the world like everybody else.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.344
I'm on antidepressants.

22:26.346 --> 22:27.845
I need help to handle
the slings and arrows,

22:27.847 --> 22:29.413
and that's okay.

22:29.415 --> 22:30.648
It doesn't make you weak.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.483
It makes you human.

22:32.485 --> 22:33.818
- What's going on?
- Something's wrong.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.720
My... my chest.

22:35.722 --> 22:36.921
She has an arrhythmia.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.122
Looks supraventricular.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.724
Blood pressure's down to 74.
What's going on?

22:39.726 --> 22:41.525
We need to cardiovert.

22:41.527 --> 22:42.660
Get the pads!

22:42.662 --> 22:44.762
Help me.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.770
Okay. Clear.

22:52.772 --> 22:53.938
Clear.

22:56.342 --> 22:58.743
Drew convinced me that he was
a responsible person.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.278
This is a major letdown.

23:00.279 --> 23:01.812
I don't even know if I'll be
able to make a case for him.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.381
Look, Nina, I've known drew
for a long time, okay?

23:03.383 --> 23:04.849
This is the guy that runs
into the burning building.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.434
This is the guy who you call

23:06.435 --> 23:08.018
when your car's broke down
on the side of the road, okay?

23:08.020 --> 23:09.520
This is not the guy
who just bounces

23:09.522 --> 23:11.655
- when life gets too tough.
- Listen to me.

23:11.657 --> 23:12.957
This little girl has been

23:12.959 --> 23:15.393
shuffled around the system
for her entire life.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.495
Now, I will not place her
in another home

23:17.497 --> 23:19.130
where the parents
aren't completely committed

23:19.132 --> 23:21.266
to her well-being.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.401
I promise you.
This is not like drew, or T.C.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.703
Okay? Something's not right.

23:26.706 --> 23:27.705
Drew, what...

23:27.707 --> 23:29.039
Kenny, I'm in jail.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.708
T.C. got into a bar fight.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.076
I jumped in to help him out.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.978
Drew, Brianna's about to
go into surgery, okay?

23:33.980 --> 23:36.647
Her donor lung came through. She
fought everybody like hell, man.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.849
She didn't want to go
into surgery until you got here.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.185
You get me out of here.
Now. You understand?

23:41.187 --> 23:42.820
You do everything you can
to get me out.

23:44.023 --> 23:46.123
All right, uh, someone's coming
to bail you out, all right?

23:46.125 --> 23:47.691
- He's in jail?
- I promise you.

23:47.693 --> 23:48.826
I promise you.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.728
- I know drew, okay?
- Yeah.

23:50.730 --> 23:51.896
- This isn't like him.
- Okay.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.431
Got to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.698
- Jessica.
- You're talking to me.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.000
Look, I don't have a choice,
all right?

23:56.002 --> 23:57.802
I got to put all
that hospital stuff aside.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.603
- I need your help.
- I-I'll do anything.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.205
All right, come on.

24:10.116 --> 24:13.751
Everything all right?
The shift survive without you?

24:21.928 --> 24:25.896
Dana, your heart rhythm
is back to normal.

24:25.898 --> 24:29.600
I felt like
I was having a heart attack.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.101
Why don't you guys look worried?

24:31.103 --> 24:32.870
Well, the arrhythmia
is a problem,

24:32.872 --> 24:34.872
but it is physical proof

24:34.874 --> 24:37.575
that your symptoms
are 100% medical,

24:37.577 --> 24:39.510
not psychological.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.646
Uh, but what's causing
all of it?

24:42.648 --> 24:45.783
We still have no clue,
but we have something to go on.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.651
Right.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.854
I was just starting
to get used to the idea

24:49.856 --> 24:51.522
of 1,000 psych meds.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.090
Now you're telling me
I'm not crazy.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.693
Hey, we're...
We're all a little crazy.

24:55.695 --> 24:56.827
I already admitted to it.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.763
And I'm currently at about 50%.

24:59.765 --> 25:01.599
But we won't give up.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.666
We'll figure this out.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.068
Okay.
Order a cardiac echo

25:04.070 --> 25:05.803
and a barium swallow test.

25:05.805 --> 25:06.971
What's that?

25:06.973 --> 25:10.241
Um, unlike the CT and endoscopy,

25:10.243 --> 25:12.943
it checks the <i> function</i>
of your esophagus,

25:12.945 --> 25:14.278
not just the appearance.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.947
It may finally tell us
what's... what's wrong,

25:16.949 --> 25:18.849
because something clearly is.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.284
Yeah.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.591
Hey, Syd.

25:27.593 --> 25:29.093
Drew said you might be
in town this week.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.595
Yep, I'm here to sign
my army discharge papers.

25:31.597 --> 25:33.130
Oh, that transition's
never easy...

25:33.132 --> 25:34.999
From a daily mission
to no mission.

25:35.001 --> 25:38.002
Took me a few months to settle
back into my civilian skin.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.803
Yeah, well, I have a plan
how to segue.

25:39.805 --> 25:41.539
But first things first,

25:41.541 --> 25:43.607
I want to say hi to drew
and meet Brianna.

25:43.609 --> 25:46.210
It's so exciting,
drew being a foster parent.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.012
It is, but actually, we're
a little worried about drew.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.280
He's completely Mia.

25:49.282 --> 25:51.615
Oh, no, we just found him.
He's in jail with T.C.

25:51.617 --> 25:54.318
- Jail?
- Yeah, Jessica went down to bail them out.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.920
Well, that doesn't
sound like drew.

25:55.922 --> 25:56.954
Something about a bar fight.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.389
Sounds like T.C.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.823
Yeah, well, Kenny spoke to drew.

25:59.825 --> 26:02.159
If you want the whole story,
he's upstairs with Brianna.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.727
Thanks.
I'll head on up.

26:03.729 --> 26:04.962
Okay.

26:04.964 --> 26:08.299
Next time, docs, just walk away.

26:08.301 --> 26:10.067
Yeah, tell him.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.836
Uh, officer, can I get a ride
to San Antonio memorial?

26:12.838 --> 26:14.238
It's an emergency.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.941
Jimmy, let's get Dr. Alister
a ride.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.008
Use the sirens.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.743
Uh, Jessica, thank you.

26:22.815 --> 26:23.847
That's it?

26:23.849 --> 26:25.616
I bail you out and no thank you?

26:25.618 --> 26:28.052
Thank you.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.626
I have my car.
Do you need a ride?

26:37.196 --> 26:39.096
Talk to me, at least.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.901
Stop avoiding me
like a sophomore in high school.

26:43.903 --> 26:46.036
I've said everything
I need to say to you.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.072
Yeah, well, I haven't.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.074
Well...

26:51.811 --> 26:54.144
Really? T.C.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.212
T.C.!

26:59.652 --> 27:02.686
Yeah, the seizures stopped,
but he could be out for a while.

27:02.688 --> 27:04.688
So, it was hyponatremia?

27:04.690 --> 27:06.223
Yeah, it looks like it.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.125
We're gonna put him
in the ICU overnight

27:08.127 --> 27:10.961
so we can monitor him and
raise his sodium levels slowly,

27:10.963 --> 27:12.262
but he should be fine.

27:12.264 --> 27:13.864
Thank you.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.766
That was, uh, a tough call.

27:15.768 --> 27:18.268
Yeah. You know, I, uh,
had to trust my instincts,

27:18.270 --> 27:20.337
which I haven't been doing
a lot of lately.

27:20.339 --> 27:23.240
Well, hey, thank you so much...

27:23.242 --> 27:24.375
- Oh.
- For everything.

27:24.377 --> 27:25.876
- I'm...
- Yeah.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.111
So grateful.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.846
Yeah, sure. Sure.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.603
I think we're done here.

27:35.604 --> 27:36.887
All right. Yeah.

27:36.889 --> 27:38.389
George, hi. You're here.

27:38.391 --> 27:40.024
He's good.

27:40.026 --> 27:41.058
- Who's George?
- Okay.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.359
Oh, he's our boyfriend.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.128
Uh, your boyfriend.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.330
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, y-you share George?

27:46.332 --> 27:48.232
Yeah, what would be
the point of not?

27:48.234 --> 27:49.833
Cristina, I'm sorry.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.102
I'm not judging, I just...

27:52.104 --> 27:54.738
It's a whole new world for me.

27:54.740 --> 27:55.873
I understand.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.174
- It's not for everyone.
- Mm.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.677
But I believe we can design
our own relationships

27:59.679 --> 28:01.111
however we want.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.414
Whatever makes us happy.

28:03.416 --> 28:05.382
Yeah.

28:05.384 --> 28:08.218
Hmm.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.087
So you really think

28:10.089 --> 28:12.389
that you can be in love with
two people at the same time?

28:12.391 --> 28:14.225
Absolutely.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.060
Matt and George are two
completely different people,

28:16.062 --> 28:18.395
and I love them both.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.164
We all get
the best of both worlds,

28:20.166 --> 28:21.331
and it's never boring.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.466
Yeah.

28:22.468 --> 28:25.002
That's why we embrace
our lifestyle.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.137
One perfect person
doesn't exist.

28:27.139 --> 28:30.908
Well, it's been nice
meeting you, Cristina.

28:30.910 --> 28:33.911
It's been educational...

28:33.913 --> 28:35.112
To say the least.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.286
Hey.

28:42.287 --> 28:44.254
- Hey.
- I've been googling polyamory.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.423
It's actually super complicated.
They have a lot of rules,

28:46.425 --> 28:48.926
and they tell each other
everything... two things I hate.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.961
They're happy
and they can make it work,

28:50.963 --> 28:52.129
who am I to judge?

28:52.131 --> 28:53.363
Not me.
I always judge.

28:53.365 --> 28:54.364
Hmm.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.300
Hey, can I ask you a question?

28:56.302 --> 28:58.836
- Yeah.
- There are rumors flying around

28:58.838 --> 29:00.838
that they may
shut down the E.R.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.506
Is that really possible?

29:02.508 --> 29:04.374
It is, but nothing is for sure.

29:04.376 --> 29:05.876
Except we all lose our jobs,

29:05.878 --> 29:08.078
and I'm screwed trying to find
another residency.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.780
I know.

29:09.782 --> 29:11.448
Shannon, I hear you, okay?

29:11.450 --> 29:13.517
But let's take things
one step at a time.

29:13.519 --> 29:15.419
There'll be plenty of time
to panic later.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.954
Jordan.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.255
We need to talk.

29:20.159 --> 29:21.792
I got to brush my teeth.

29:25.498 --> 29:27.030
Scott told me.

29:27.032 --> 29:29.466
Annie, I am sorry.

29:29.468 --> 29:32.236
Okay?
We never meant to hurt you.

29:32.237 --> 29:35.005
It was just an emotional night
with the surgery and Malik.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.173
That is all.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.008
Do you want to get back together
with him?

29:38.010 --> 29:41.445
My first answer is no.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.847
But if I'm gonna be
perfectly honest with you,

29:43.849 --> 29:46.517
I don't know how I feel
about anyone or anything.

29:46.519 --> 29:49.520
It's been a hell of a year,
and I...

29:50.990 --> 29:53.390
I'm emotionally confused.

29:53.392 --> 29:57.427
Okay.
I totally get that.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.863
Thank you
for being honest with me.

30:01.834 --> 30:04.868
Oh, you're getting
a lot of chick action.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.171
Maybe you should try it.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.972
Shut up.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.440
Could be just what you need.

30:10.442 --> 30:11.875
Shut up!

30:20.352 --> 30:22.019
- What O.R. is Brianna in?
- One.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.287
The surgery's already started.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.489
She's really weak.
It's touch and go.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.394
<i>Give me an update.</i>

30:30.396 --> 30:32.830
<i>- 50/50.
- She's a fighter, drew.</i>

30:35.434 --> 30:37.401
If she doesn't make it
through the surgery,

30:37.403 --> 30:40.971
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.472
I should have been there.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.575
There is nothing you can do
about that right now.

30:44.577 --> 30:47.911
Look, as a parent, you are going
to make mistakes sometimes.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.414
I have made so many, I can't
even remember them all.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.549
But I try to learn
from my screw-ups,

30:52.551 --> 30:54.484
and I work at being
a better mother.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.322
Drew, you're never
gonna be perfect.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.424
But right now, you have to
pull yourself together,

31:00.426 --> 31:03.594
because beating yourself up
will not help her.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.600
And a little prayer never hurt.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.621
This is some seriously
petulant, childish crap.

31:30.623 --> 31:32.456
I bailed you out.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.091
The least you can do
is talk to me.

31:34.093 --> 31:35.926
I didn't ask you to bail me out.

31:35.928 --> 31:38.028
I didn't ask you to get on
this bus with me, so...

31:38.030 --> 31:40.063
I don't blame you
for being pissed off.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.598
- I screwed up.
- Yeah.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.066
I did.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.533
I should have told you
what was going on.

31:44.536 --> 31:47.137
But that's in the past.
How do I fix it?

31:47.139 --> 31:49.273
How do I make it up to you,
to everybody else?

31:49.275 --> 31:51.408
- What do I do?
- Well, short of

31:51.409 --> 31:53.542
getting in a time machine and
changing everything you did,

31:53.545 --> 31:55.145
it's not gonna happen.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.614
- So that's it?
- Yep.

31:57.616 --> 32:01.118
No room in your heart for
repentance, for forgiveness?

32:01.120 --> 32:03.620
Not even a conversation?
You just shut down?

32:03.622 --> 32:06.523
I get that maybe the way I do
things is not the right way

32:06.525 --> 32:09.660
and maybe it's not good for me,
but it's who I am.

32:09.662 --> 32:12.329
And I'm self-aware enough to
know that I'm not gonna change

32:12.331 --> 32:14.698
because I don't want to change.

32:14.699 --> 32:17.066
And that's why Jordan left me,
and that's why I am leaving you.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.635
Wow.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.405
So, just get off the bus.

32:21.407 --> 32:23.607
Okay.

32:25.644 --> 32:28.178
You know, you're missing out
on a lot,

32:28.180 --> 32:31.281
because life
is all about change.

32:32.318 --> 32:35.352
See you around,
Thomas Charles Callahan.

32:39.091 --> 32:40.324
It could've been great.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.292
It could have.

32:49.568 --> 32:52.636
I understand that you didn't start
the fight, but from now on,

32:52.638 --> 32:54.604
you have to be more careful
choosing your friends.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.707
There is going to be a lot
of scrutiny on you and Rick.

32:56.709 --> 32:58.508
Don't give them
any other excuses to deny you.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.377
It was out of my control,
but I can promise you this...

33:00.379 --> 33:01.745
It's never gonna happen again,
okay?

33:01.747 --> 33:03.547
I will do my best
to make this go away,

33:03.549 --> 33:05.716
but do not make me regret
going out on a limb for you.

33:07.252 --> 33:08.652
Look who I found
wandering the halls.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.487
I just got the message.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.321
I was on a drug bust.
I came straight from the field.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.690
Oh, did I need to see you.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.359
- Oh, what happened to you?
- It's fine.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.594
I'll tell you later.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.062
How's she doing?

33:19.064 --> 33:20.731
It was tough for a while,

33:20.733 --> 33:23.200
but they're finally putting in
the new lung.

33:23.202 --> 33:26.603
Even then, it's too early to say
whether it's gonna take.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.171
It's gonna be a long night.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.640
Which brings me to coffee.
You guys want any?

33:30.642 --> 33:32.109
- Yeah.
- Please, yeah.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.111
Okay.

33:43.489 --> 33:46.723
So, Dana, your swallow study
shows that you have achalasia.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.425
- What is that?
- Can you see that?

33:48.427 --> 33:52.662
Your lower esophageal sphincter
isn't working properly.

33:52.664 --> 33:55.298
Okay, what does that
have to do with my heart?

33:55.300 --> 33:58.668
Now, you said
your stomach problems got worse

33:58.670 --> 34:02.606
after your trip to Peru, right?

34:02.608 --> 34:04.608
What does that
have to do with my heart?

34:04.610 --> 34:08.411
Well, did your eyelids
ever get really swollen?

34:08.414 --> 34:10.848
Actually, yeah.

34:10.849 --> 34:13.283
I just assumed it was an allergic
reaction from my new dog.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.252
I think you were bit
by an insect,

34:15.254 --> 34:17.054
something called
the... the kissing bug.

34:17.056 --> 34:18.789
It's very common
in Latin America.

34:18.791 --> 34:21.690
- You're thinking chagas.
- Chagas.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.760
What's chagas?

34:23.762 --> 34:26.797
You developed an infection
from the bug bite.

34:26.799 --> 34:28.632
That caused inflammation

34:28.634 --> 34:32.135
that weakened and dilated
your esophagus and heart muscle.

34:32.137 --> 34:34.638
Are you serious?

34:34.639 --> 34:36.440
I have a diagnosis?

34:36.442 --> 34:38.341
Yeah, you have a diagnosis.

34:38.342 --> 34:39.810
Yeah, luckily
we caught it in time

34:39.812 --> 34:42.245
so the effect on your heart
is minimal.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.679
Thank you for believing in me.

34:45.217 --> 34:48.351
Wasn't just me.
It's all part of the job.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.659
Got somewhere else to go, buddy?

34:56.661 --> 34:59.329
You can't ride this
all night and day, you know.

34:59.331 --> 35:01.498
There's a shelter
down the street.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.167
Yeah. Thanks.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.784
Drew?

35:21.620 --> 35:22.886
Yeah, I'm right here.

35:22.888 --> 35:25.388
Hey, s-so is Rick.

35:25.390 --> 35:28.258
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.459
How you feeling?

35:30.696 --> 35:33.797
I can breathe.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.332
Oh, my gosh.
I can breathe.

35:36.535 --> 35:39.836
Let's check your peak flow.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.541
420.

35:44.543 --> 35:45.775
Is that good?

35:45.777 --> 35:47.277
That's good.

35:47.279 --> 35:48.912
That's very good.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.184
Bri, this is Syd.

35:54.186 --> 35:55.252
Hi, honey.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.887
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

35:56.889 --> 35:58.788
You're prettier
than drew described you.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.524
Really?

36:01.593 --> 36:03.360
But he likes boys, so...

36:05.931 --> 36:08.798
You're killing me.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.867
Paul?

36:10.869 --> 36:12.736
Thank you.

36:12.738 --> 36:16.306
I don't think I could have done
the surgery without you.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.774
You're the best.

36:17.776 --> 36:19.176
I'm just glad
you're feeling better.

36:23.782 --> 36:27.217
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me.

36:27.219 --> 36:30.520
And I will never let you down
like that again.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.955
I will always be there for you.

36:31.957 --> 36:34.724
I know.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.760
That's why
you're gonna be my dad.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.263
Both of you.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.771
I just wanted
to let everybody know

36:47.773 --> 36:50.507
that Brianna's new lung
is working.

36:50.509 --> 36:52.842
It's gonna be a long road back,
but the transplant team

36:52.844 --> 36:55.679
is really optimistic
that she's gonna do great.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.714
Awesome!

36:57.716 --> 36:58.915
Great.

37:02.421 --> 37:05.455
Topher, the day shift is here
and if it's all right with you,

37:05.457 --> 37:06.623
I'm gonna go break out

37:06.625 --> 37:08.325
the leftover beer
from the 4th of July?

37:08.327 --> 37:09.826
- As long as I get the first one.
- Yes, sir.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.861
- Ooh, I get the second one.
- Yes, ma'am.

37:11.863 --> 37:13.296
- Thank you.
- Hey, Topher.

37:13.298 --> 37:14.464
- Hey.
- Do you mind if I put

37:14.466 --> 37:15.865
some of these flyers up
around the E.R.?

37:15.867 --> 37:17.934
Sure.
You're doing this?

37:17.936 --> 37:19.903
Yeah, this is the segue
out of the army

37:19.905 --> 37:21.538
- I was telling you about.
- Oh.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.807
I can't go from daily missions
to no missions.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.442
Here you go.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.611
And Riley is with her dad?

37:27.613 --> 37:29.980
She's at summer camp
for a month.

37:29.982 --> 37:31.648
So I'm gonna go
to the turkish border

37:31.650 --> 37:32.949
and help Syrian refugees.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.518
I was hoping to recruit
some doctors and nurses

37:35.520 --> 37:37.854
to come with me,
if that's okay with you.

37:37.856 --> 37:40.290
I-I wish I could join you.

37:40.292 --> 37:41.691
I've got too much on my plate.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.426
Got to keep this place
away from the devil.

37:43.428 --> 37:44.828
Yeah, uh, Syd,
this is very tempting,

37:44.830 --> 37:46.496
but with the sale
of the hospital,

37:46.498 --> 37:47.931
we're just... we're all
in crisis mode.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.300
I-I can't leave.

37:50.302 --> 37:52.435
Besides, I'm like
Topher's woobie.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.670
You are.

37:53.672 --> 37:56.773
I was hoping you'd say that.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.408
You are my rock, Jordan.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.443
Hey, right back at you.

38:00.445 --> 38:03.380
It's quite the family
you've got here.

38:03.382 --> 38:04.948
It's not something
you see very often.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.549
That's why I'm gonna do
everything I can

38:06.551 --> 38:08.585
to keep it together.

38:08.587 --> 38:09.719
Of course you are.

38:10.555 --> 38:12.756
I'll be back.

38:12.758 --> 38:15.425
Look, Topher, um...

38:15.427 --> 38:18.561
Maybe it's time we tell everyone
what's really going on.

38:18.563 --> 38:20.864
You know, the rumor mill...
It's going crazy.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.766
Right.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.668
Okay.

38:24.669 --> 38:26.569
After that beer, though, okay?

38:26.571 --> 38:27.570
Yeah, or three.

38:27.572 --> 38:28.972
Yeah.

38:33.378 --> 38:35.612
* we're all falling,
and we need a place to hide *

38:35.614 --> 38:37.047
I really am sorry,

38:37.049 --> 38:38.815
about the thing that happened
with Jordan.

38:38.817 --> 38:41.584
Really? 'Cause it...
It seems like

38:41.586 --> 38:43.920
maybe there's something
more to it, from both of you.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.990
It's just... there's a lot of
history between the two of us,

38:46.992 --> 38:48.992
so...

38:48.994 --> 38:50.360
It's complicated.

38:50.362 --> 38:52.062
Yeah.
You say you're with me,

38:52.064 --> 38:54.964
but you're kissing her.
That's pretty complicated.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.466
* our home *

38:56.468 --> 38:58.435
I'm not someone's
second choice, Scott.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.970
No, I know.
And you shouldn't be.

39:00.972 --> 39:02.906
And I really care about you.

39:02.908 --> 39:04.507
I do.

39:04.509 --> 39:08.812
So, could we maybe just
slow things down

39:08.814 --> 39:10.580
a little?

39:10.582 --> 39:12.716
Okay.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.158
I think that's probably
for the best.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.793
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

39:23.795 --> 39:27.063
Yeah, uh, seen better days...
And nights.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.965
Look like you were hit
by a truck.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.934
Literally and metaphorically.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.869
How's Brianna?

39:32.871 --> 39:35.105
- Surgery was a success.
- Yeah?

39:35.107 --> 39:37.107
Is drew with her?

39:37.109 --> 39:38.976
I would probably
stay away from him.

39:38.977 --> 39:41.057
I don't think that pretty face
can take another shot.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.481
Is that, um...

39:44.483 --> 39:46.783
U.N. relief group, uh...

39:46.785 --> 39:48.602
You doing that?

39:48.603 --> 39:50.420
Yeah, I'm headed to turkey
next week.

39:50.422 --> 39:53.957
Yeah, I could really do
with a change of scenery.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.760
Toph, um, you think
that I could...

39:56.762 --> 39:58.595
You know, honestly, brother,

39:58.596 --> 40:00.429
with everything
that's going on in the hospital,

40:00.432 --> 40:01.664
I think it would help everyone

40:01.666 --> 40:03.566
if you got out of here
for a little while.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.502
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.704
Okay.
I guess I'll go pack my bags.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.407
Wait. Hold up, cowboy. I didn't
give you the thumbs-up yet.

40:10.409 --> 40:11.674
I don't need a loose canon.

40:11.676 --> 40:13.910
I need someone
who is there to do the job.

40:13.912 --> 40:17.013
Toph, can you, um, tell her
I can do it?

40:17.015 --> 40:19.449
Despite his present condition,

40:19.451 --> 40:23.153
there is nobody that you would
want to have your back

40:23.155 --> 40:25.655
in a place like that...

40:25.657 --> 40:26.990
Than this guy.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.961
All right, you're hired.

40:31.963 --> 40:34.697
But you screw up, and you are
on the first plane back home.

40:34.699 --> 40:36.833
Guess I better not
screw up, then.

40:39.070 --> 40:41.171
I hope that was the right call.

40:41.173 --> 40:43.606
It was.
Chaos is his happy place.

40:46.044 --> 40:49.479
Speaking of chaos...
Uh, everybody?

40:49.481 --> 40:51.581
All right. Let me...
Let me catch you up

40:51.583 --> 40:53.116
on where we're at
with the hospital.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.018
Uh-oh.

40:57.489 --> 40:58.655
Hey.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.123
Hey.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.091
Wow. Looks like
you had a really rough night.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.693
Yeah.

41:03.695 --> 41:07.464
It's been a rough
couple of nights this week.

41:07.466 --> 41:09.766
T, you've come so far.
Don't slide now.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.901
Yeah, I'm trying.

41:11.903 --> 41:14.237
Maybe this is just who I am.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.573
It's not.

41:18.477 --> 41:21.077
I'm going overseas with Syd.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.812
Good to clear my head.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.882
Guess I'll see you
in a couple weeks.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.050
Come here.

41:27.052 --> 41:29.886
* and we all
sit around the fire *

41:29.888 --> 41:31.621
you be careful over there, okay?

41:31.623 --> 41:33.089
You be careful over here.

41:34.693 --> 41:39.496
* and we all
sit around the fire *

41:39.498 --> 41:42.532
* we feel so much better now *
