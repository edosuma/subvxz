00:04.160 --> 00:05.709
Previously on ER:

00:05.713 --> 00:08.660
Glass of wine and a hot bath
at the end of the day helps.

00:08.667 --> 00:10.281
Hmm, it sounds good to me.

00:10.293 --> 00:11.814
...our water bill 'cause I need to...

00:13.500 --> 00:16.192
- Do you live with someone?
- We love you.

00:16.207 --> 00:19.562
- I can't do this anymore.
- There's a little girl.

00:19.567 --> 00:22.140
Curtis Ames.
He was a patient of mine.

00:22.144 --> 00:25.177
He followed my wife
and child to the park.

00:25.214 --> 00:27.715
Help me protect my family.

00:32.683 --> 00:36.503
My mom used to put it in a trash bag.
Chicken broth and a can of Crisco.

00:36.513 --> 00:39.376
Yikes. Grill it on the barbecue.
You'll never go back.

00:39.385 --> 00:42.990
I read that brining keeps the juices in.

00:44.709 --> 00:47.203
Hey, did you remember to take
the giblets out of the marinade?

00:47.218 --> 00:49.840
- Take what out of what?
- C-spine is clear.

00:49.848 --> 00:52.112
Well, we should at least
try to pull off the gravy.

00:52.126 --> 00:54.011
All right, sir, I'm gonna take
this collar off.

00:54.165 --> 00:55.841
Let us know if anything hurts, okay?

00:55.856 --> 00:58.670
Deep fried turkey
is a religious experience.

00:58.677 --> 01:01.582
- Gross.
- You'd rather cook it in a trash bag?

01:01.598 --> 01:04.950
Americans, so sentimental
about their holidays.

01:05.046 --> 01:08.192
This from the guy that celebrates
Croatian Independence,

01:08.207 --> 01:11.452
Croatian State Day and something
called Patriotic Gratitude Day.

01:12.216 --> 01:14.313
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:16.148 --> 01:19.192
I have ten minutes left in my shift
and the transport pager goes off.

01:19.206 --> 01:21.431
- I'll go.
- No, you can't. You're an intern.

01:21.516 --> 01:23.941
Maybe the dispatcher just wants
to say "Happy Thanksgiving."

01:23.957 --> 01:26.513
Yeah, right, I'm sure that's what it is.

01:28.005 --> 01:30.270
- Jane? Jane!
- Abby.

01:30.288 --> 01:32.141
You're supposed to carry the transport
pager overnight, right?

01:32.146 --> 01:33.720
- Uh, yeah.
- Well, it just went off,

01:33.786 --> 01:36.501
and I was thinking maybe
you could just take it?

01:36.867 --> 01:39.171
- Mmm... no.
- No?

01:39.708 --> 01:40.782
Come on.
Why not?

01:40.797 --> 01:42.783
Five more minutes,
it would've been your call anyway.

01:42.908 --> 01:44.991
Sorry, Abby, it just doesn't
really work that way.

01:45.006 --> 01:46.142
What way?

01:46.158 --> 01:48.853
Well, if the pager goes off during
your shift, then you have to go.

01:48.868 --> 01:50.980
Yeah, but I just want to spend
Thanksgiving with my kid.

01:50.997 --> 01:52.643
You know, it's like that story with the guy

01:52.656 --> 01:54.852
who's hunting dinosaurs and he strays off the path

01:54.866 --> 01:57.860
and steps on a butterfly and then
everything in the future's ever so

01:57.866 --> 01:59.243
- slightly different.
- What?

01:59.258 --> 02:02.101
It's bad karma to mess
with the universal order of things.

02:02.118 --> 02:04.250
Erase unicycle man.
He can go.

02:04.405 --> 02:05.673
- Ray.
- Yeah?

02:05.686 --> 02:07.753
- Take this run, I'll owe you big time.
- Ooh, I'd love to.

02:07.766 --> 02:09.032
- Great.
- I can't.

02:09.048 --> 02:11.880
Pratt thinks I'm losing too much ER time.
He banned me from transports.

02:11.898 --> 02:13.893
Well, I just like having you near me, Ray.

02:14.098 --> 02:16.363
Surprise, surprise-- you all get me
instead of Morris tonight.

02:16.375 --> 02:19.090
He begged me to switch so
he could spend time with his kids.

02:19.318 --> 02:20.992
That's why I'm here.
What's your excuse?

02:21.037 --> 02:24.440
Henry went to Orlando with his grandparents.
I figured I might as well come in.

02:24.455 --> 02:26.842
Oh. I love working on Thanksgiving.
Everybody's at home

02:26.858 --> 02:29.241
eating and watching football,
even the freaks.

02:29.257 --> 02:32.812
Ah, the great American tradition
of sanctioned gluttony. No, thanks.

02:32.835 --> 02:34.202
I'm not trying to block the run,

02:34.216 --> 02:38.410
I'm just asking does a garden variety
MI really need a doc on board?

02:38.648 --> 02:42.722
Miss Lulu Davis, age 12, vomiting
and abdominal pain times two hours.

02:42.738 --> 02:44.983
- Hi, I'm Dr. Figler.
- Hey, Lulu.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.101
We'll take care of you.
I got this.

02:46.115 --> 02:48.101
- Oh, I got here first.
- Yeah, but I'm good with kids.

02:48.118 --> 02:50.662
- Are you saying that I'm not?
- No, hold on. Wait a minute.

02:50.675 --> 02:52.653
H-H-Hold on a second.
Lulu, are you okay?

02:56.186 --> 02:57.202
Oops.

02:57.495 --> 02:58.711
Cranberries.

02:58.726 --> 03:01.063
Sorry, Jane.
Karma sucks.

03:10.225 --> 03:13.452
Three hours at 450.

03:13.466 --> 03:15.452
- And don't forget to baste.
- How often?

03:16.006 --> 03:18.702
I don't know.
30 minutes?

03:19.247 --> 03:21.341
I don't know. I'll probably be home
in time to mash the potatoes.

03:21.348 --> 03:25.483
- Okay, what do I do with the pumpkin?
- Oh... I forgot about the pie.

03:25.498 --> 03:28.910
- Dr. Kovac, you got a minute?
- Uh, yeah, just a second.

03:28.926 --> 03:31.013
I thought pumpkins
were only for Halloween.

03:31.025 --> 03:33.390
You know what, screw the pie.
I never really liked pumpkins anyway.

03:33.808 --> 03:35.953
Are you sure you just don't want
to order Chinese?

03:36.536 --> 03:38.702
But baste, remember to baste!

03:40.337 --> 03:42.600
I went to see your guy,
Curtis Ames, yesterday.

03:42.616 --> 03:44.601
He didn't know anything
about any kid's toy.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.663
Did he admit to following
them to the park?

03:46.676 --> 03:48.820
He didn't know
what I was talking about.

03:49.005 --> 03:50.821
Look, the guy's had a pretty
tough time at things.

03:50.835 --> 03:52.110
You know, he's barely getting by.

03:52.128 --> 03:55.750
Okay, I realize that, but that's no excuse
for messing with my family.

03:55.776 --> 03:56.953
If you want my opinion,

03:56.966 --> 04:00.691
he's too busy trying to feed and clothe
himself to mess with anyone, Doc.

04:02.007 --> 04:03.312
Right.

04:07.837 --> 04:09.363
- You get airsick?
- No.

04:09.377 --> 04:10.591
Claustrophobic?

04:10.665 --> 04:12.982
Maybe you should just
tell me about the patient.

04:13.645 --> 04:16.310
88-year-old female, anterior MI.

04:16.336 --> 04:18.329
I can't tell you how many docs
think they can handle this,

04:18.338 --> 04:20.373
- then freak out at altitude.
- I work in an ER.

04:20.386 --> 04:23.400
- It's pretty hard to freak me out.
- You do okay with heights, honey?

04:23.415 --> 04:24.663
Loud noises?

04:24.676 --> 04:27.952
Yeah, but mice make me jump
on a chair and say, "Eek."

04:29.746 --> 04:32.491
Danny!
Meet Dr. Lockhart!

04:32.506 --> 04:34.192
- Hi!
- Sit!

04:34.978 --> 04:36.473
Don't stand.

04:36.676 --> 04:39.362
Don't disembark till we tell you to.

04:39.726 --> 04:42.911
Keep your headset and
your seatbelt on at all times.

04:43.006 --> 04:44.743
If you need to speak to us,

04:44.755 --> 04:47.923
slide this switch this way
to activate the intercom.

04:47.938 --> 04:51.422
Do not press that button.
That transmits over the radio.

04:55.308 --> 04:57.103
This baby is tight.

04:59.895 --> 05:01.002
Excuse me?

05:01.015 --> 05:03.680
First night out after
two months of upgrades.

05:03.998 --> 05:07.100
Satellite phone, GPS, new hoist.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.272
All the cool toys.

05:09.756 --> 05:11.531
I'm Jasper.
This is Evan.

05:11.538 --> 05:12.493
Hey.

05:13.097 --> 05:14.823
What'd you say your name was?

05:15.848 --> 05:18.263
- Abby.
- Abby.

05:18.778 --> 05:21.612
# Come fly with me #

05:21.735 --> 05:25.032
# Let's float down to Peru #

05:25.507 --> 05:28.830
# In llama land #
# There's a one-man band #

05:28.847 --> 05:32.813
# And he'll toot
his flute for you #

05:32.905 --> 05:36.953
# Come fly with me, Abby #

05:37.566 --> 05:40.942
# Let's take off
In the blue #

06:04.886 --> 06:07.180
Does it hurt when I press
or when I let go?

06:07.195 --> 06:08.551
About the same.

06:08.998 --> 06:11.932
- I'm thirsty.
- Too bad. You're NPO.

06:11.947 --> 06:14.312
- What's that?
- "Nil per os."  Nothing by mouth.

06:14.317 --> 06:17.201
Food or liquids may exacerbate
or complicate an obstruction,

06:17.237 --> 06:20.653
volvulus or inflammation.
Not to mention increased aspiration risk

06:20.668 --> 06:23.232
during intubation should you
be going to the OR tonight.

06:23.598 --> 06:26.390
Um... I'm sorry I threw up on you.

06:26.408 --> 06:30.902
Oh, I don't mind the fact that I had to take
a shower to get the chunks out of my hair.

06:30.958 --> 06:34.773
I just honestly don't know how I'm gonna
survive a whole shift dressed like this.

06:34.776 --> 06:38.100
Hey, Lulu, I'm gonna order up a few tests
to see what's going on in there, okay?

06:38.178 --> 06:41.473
I mean, bunnies, puppy dogs--
I'm like breaking out in hives.

06:41.478 --> 06:43.573
Jane, why don't you let me
take it from here.

06:44.268 --> 06:46.903
- Your parents are on their way, right?
- Uh, yeah, definitely.

06:46.928 --> 06:50.961
I think it's hip. I think it's fetishy.
I think you totally pull it off.

06:50.976 --> 06:52.351
Shut up, Gates.

06:52.367 --> 06:55.242
Hey, Sam, I need a CBC
on the little girl in two.

06:55.256 --> 06:59.192
And order up an extra red top if you can
just in case the blood bank needs it.

06:59.207 --> 07:00.790
- Got it.
- Hey, Alex.

07:01.086 --> 07:04.752
Don't ya have anything better to do than hangout
with a bunch of losers like us on Thanksgiving?

07:05.107 --> 07:08.313
If he stayed at home,
he'd play video games all night, so

07:08.325 --> 07:10.942
I figured I'd bring him in here and
make him do a little community service.

07:10.956 --> 07:12.620
That's cool, man.

07:12.634 --> 07:15.373
Yeah, handing out cookies to sick people.
That's really cool.

07:15.373 --> 07:17.846
Hey, it could be worse.
You could be one of those sick people.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.910
Four pages in the last 20 minutes?

07:19.929 --> 07:22.183
- What's the crisis, Dr. Gates?
- Oh, no crisis.

07:22.205 --> 07:27.353
It's just an incarcerated hernia, a gluteal
abscess, road rash that needs skin grafting,

07:27.368 --> 07:30.721
an imbedded drill bit,
rule-out appy on a 12-year-old girl.

07:30.736 --> 07:32.630
- You're making this up.
- I wish I were.

07:32.645 --> 07:34.670
You're sure it's not just an excuse
to keep me down here?

07:34.685 --> 07:38.081
Oh, please, I would never dream
of wasting your time like that.

07:38.467 --> 07:39.550
But really...

07:39.778 --> 07:42.270
must you look so hot all the time?

07:42.277 --> 07:45.641
I mean, even in that ridiculous hat,
I can't concentrate.

07:45.657 --> 07:47.061
- I can't even talk.
- You know,

07:47.207 --> 07:49.653
enough of this harassment.
I have work to do.

07:53.026 --> 07:55.202
Are you the team from County?
Yeah. Watch it. Watch it.

07:55.277 --> 07:56.840
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

07:56.928 --> 08:01.472
Mom was fine, cooked a 20-pound turkey.
She carved it and then she just collapsed.

08:01.487 --> 08:04.460
- We thought she was kidding around.
- But then we couldn't wake her up.

08:04.475 --> 08:06.452
- That must've been scary.
- Get the history later.

08:06.467 --> 08:08.952
- You guys stay out here.
- We need to examine your mother.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.020
Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient,
Elizabeth Timmons.

08:12.036 --> 08:13.741
Thank heavens.
This way.

08:17.337 --> 08:19.283
You didn't say anything
about her being intubated.

08:19.297 --> 08:21.750
- They never tell the whole story.
- Vitals?

08:21.825 --> 08:25.311
- Tachy to 124, sat 92.
- You got a BP?

08:25.316 --> 08:28.273
Last one was 74/38 on dopa.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.832
- Great. What about an EKG?
- Right here.

08:30.848 --> 08:32.880
- Dr. Russo, thanks for coming.
- Abby Lockhart.

08:32.898 --> 08:34.793
This place gets really backed up
when we have a patient like this.

08:34.806 --> 08:37.172
- Sat's 82.
- She's tombstoning.

08:37.287 --> 08:39.460
- What about thrombolytics?
- Already gave it, no response.

08:39.476 --> 08:40.591
Okay, okay.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.480
I'm sorry.
Can we have a reality check here?

08:42.488 --> 08:45.162
Does this family know how sick she is?
They know she's having a heart attack.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.771
Do they know that she's not breathing
and her blood pressure sucks

08:47.787 --> 08:50.223
and she's probably not perfusing
her brain enough?

08:50.318 --> 08:51.892
I mean, we can't move her.

08:51.908 --> 08:54.073
- She's unstable.
- The family wants her out of here.

08:54.125 --> 08:56.333
- She won't make the trip.
- You don't know that.

08:56.775 --> 09:01.091
If she survives the helicopter, she will probably
die before the family makes it to County.

09:01.105 --> 09:02.721
- What's your point?
- Well...

09:04.797 --> 09:07.552
she's 88 years old.
She's not coming back from this.

09:07.927 --> 09:10.453
Don't you think dying here
with her loved ones

09:10.465 --> 09:12.802
is better than dying alone
in the ICU at County?

09:12.835 --> 09:15.451
Listen, Doctor.
Our job is to scoop and run.

09:15.476 --> 09:18.910
The longer we stay and jaw about it, the
more unstable this little lady's gonna get.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.873
All right, you know what,
just give me five minutes.

09:20.887 --> 09:22.732
I'm gonna make sure they understand.

09:24.687 --> 09:27.930
52 years, rain or shine.

09:27.966 --> 09:33.973
He drives me around the lake
on a tandem bike after Thanksgiving.

09:34.025 --> 09:36.340
Ah, isn't that sweet.
You're blind, Mr. Hunter.

09:36.358 --> 09:37.713
Maybe you should let her drive.

09:37.738 --> 09:40.542
Oh, that wouldn't work at all.
I can't carry a tune.

09:40.555 --> 09:43.233
He drives, I sing.
It's tradition.

09:43.248 --> 09:45.773
Send him to radiology and call me
hen the films get back.

09:45.806 --> 09:47.871
Ray, help.
I need an order for sumatriptan.

09:47.885 --> 09:50.302
- Migraines?
- I get one every Thanksgiving.

09:50.317 --> 09:53.033
- It's the stuffing.
- Okay, 20 milligrams intranasally.

09:53.045 --> 09:54.831
Then why do you eat it?

09:54.846 --> 09:59.123
Because it's amazing.
Mom makes it with bacon and almonds.

09:59.178 --> 10:02.852
Lands me in the hospital every
Thanksgiving. Hmm, but it's worth it.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.213
I'll be right back with your medicine.

10:07.026 --> 10:10.212
Holidays weird me out.
The special foods, the little rituals.

10:10.226 --> 10:11.881
- It's not my thing.
- Yeah,

10:11.897 --> 10:15.500
when I was a kid, Thanksgiving was just an
excuse to stay home all day and watch TV.

10:15.517 --> 10:18.682
I always figured when I grew up
and had kids of my own,

10:18.695 --> 10:23.210
I'd do the whole family thing,
a big banquet, but you know,

10:23.226 --> 10:26.281
here we are, just me and Alex,
hanging out in the hospital.

10:27.496 --> 10:30.171
Didn't your parents demand you
come home for the holiday?

10:30.185 --> 10:32.360
Nah, my mom's in Trinidad
with her new boyfriend

10:32.367 --> 10:35.900
and my dad's never even heard
of a home-cooked meal, so...

10:36.206 --> 10:37.453
Ah, well.

10:37.466 --> 10:40.122
At least you got something hot
waiting for you at home.

10:41.186 --> 10:42.301
What?

10:43.516 --> 10:45.582
Missing your cell phone perhaps?

10:46.655 --> 10:47.661
What?

10:48.077 --> 10:50.611
Yeah, how did you...

10:51.035 --> 10:54.191
Hematology needed you,
so we called your cell phone

10:54.205 --> 10:56.631
and you will never guess who answered.

10:58.528 --> 11:01.070
Surgical med student Katey Alvaro.

11:01.758 --> 11:05.203
- Oh, well, we were studying.
- Right.

11:05.227 --> 11:08.622
I mean, well, she couldn't talk
'cause she was baking you something.

11:08.727 --> 11:09.992
A little treat.

11:12.736 --> 11:14.681
Any chance you could
be wrong about this?

11:14.697 --> 11:16.381
Well, y-yes, but I just--

11:16.398 --> 11:17.942
- based on my experience...
- Well, which is it?

11:18.168 --> 11:20.040
First, you tell us that
he won't survive the trip

11:20.056 --> 11:21.620
and now you say
that you might be wrong.

11:21.635 --> 11:23.362
I know this is hard.
I'm sorry.

11:23.376 --> 11:25.343
- I just think it's important that you take...
- Time's up. Let's go.

11:25.345 --> 11:28.103
- All right, just wait.
- Find the clerk, sign the consent.

11:28.116 --> 11:30.942
- We'll be at County in 45 minutes.
- But she just said that we should think...

11:30.955 --> 11:32.653
It's your mom's only chance.

11:33.076 --> 11:36.341
Okay. Uh, take her.

11:36.776 --> 11:37.831
Come on.

11:42.858 --> 11:44.310
She is going to die.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.371
Yeah, and I'm doing my best
to facilitate a good death for her.

11:47.385 --> 11:49.270
- That's not your job.
- Not your call.

11:49.288 --> 11:51.750
Here's how it works.
The referring hospital refers

11:51.767 --> 11:54.570
and the accepting hospital accepts
and we're just the deliverymen.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.301
- Sorry, delivery people.
- You're denying the responsibility

11:57.317 --> 12:00.393
- that comes with your job.
- I'm not the one who's in denial here.

12:00.407 --> 12:02.362
Good death?
No such thing, babe.

12:02.377 --> 12:04.782
If you think you can make this
a good experience for that family,

12:04.807 --> 12:06.961
you're even more arrogant than I thought.

12:07.117 --> 12:11.763
Mom, if you can hear me,
we'll see you in Chicago. Okay?

12:11.778 --> 12:14.221
Hey, in a few weeks,
you're gonna be a great-grandmother.

12:14.236 --> 12:15.960
Everyone stay back.

12:16.577 --> 12:18.791
God bless you, Dr. Lockhart.

12:23.387 --> 12:25.153
Systolic's holding above 80.

12:25.168 --> 12:28.772
- Yeah, on 20 mikes of dopamine.
- Still counts.

12:31.998 --> 12:35.522
All right, you know,
maybe you were right,

12:35.537 --> 12:37.511
- maybe...
- D-Don't say it. Don't say it.

12:37.525 --> 12:40.133
Nothing more painful than
listening to a lady eat crow.

12:40.146 --> 12:43.873
- I'm not eating crow.
- Which reminds me, I am starving.

12:44.858 --> 12:47.473
- Good idea.
- Turkey, cranberry sauce.

12:47.486 --> 12:51.132
- Wife even baked the bread.
- We got a patient here. She's fine.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.131
You know, I feel sorry for your old man.

12:53.518 --> 12:55.451
What's that supposed to mean?

13:02.967 --> 13:05.632
- It's just the turbulence.
- I don't think so.

13:05.676 --> 13:07.650
Charge the defibrillator now.

13:08.787 --> 13:11.422
Febrile to 101, vomiting
and mild rebound.

13:11.456 --> 13:13.403
How long has this been going on, sweetie?

13:13.417 --> 13:15.250
It started during the salad.

13:15.278 --> 13:18.723
Salad for Thanksgiving?
Your family's weird.

13:19.316 --> 13:21.470
- Tell me about it.
- White count?

13:22.146 --> 13:23.503
Pending.

13:25.366 --> 13:27.202
Are those chocolate chip?

13:28.367 --> 13:29.662
Uh, no.

13:29.678 --> 13:32.753
- Could I have one anyway?
- Um, yeah, sure.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.430
You know, this holiday is a lie.

13:38.946 --> 13:40.000
Really?

13:40.016 --> 13:43.281
Yeah, the only thing the pilgrims
shared with the Indians were measles.

13:44.105 --> 13:46.401
- Okay.
- I'm Lulu.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.672
- Thanks for the cookie.
- Yeah.

13:49.255 --> 13:51.720
Hey, you can't eat that, honey; you're NPO.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.000
Oh, yeah, nil per os.

13:54.207 --> 13:56.210
It's Thanksgiving and I can't even eat.

13:56.238 --> 14:00.473
Alex, what did I tell you about asking the doctors
or nurses before giving away the cookies?

14:01.978 --> 14:03.201
Labs are back.

14:04.187 --> 14:07.353
Her white count's 14.
Let's get a CT. I'll call the scanner.

14:07.365 --> 14:10.023
All right, you know, we talked to
your mom on the phone earlier

14:10.036 --> 14:14.160
and she gave us permission to give you
a very special X ray on your tummy.

14:14.606 --> 14:16.372
She didn't want to talk to me?

14:17.785 --> 14:20.992
No, but she said to make sure
we treat you like a VIP.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.942
- I'm sure she'll be here soon.
- That's okay.

14:24.958 --> 14:26.760
Alex can wait with me.

14:27.117 --> 14:28.433
Right, Alex?

14:29.197 --> 14:30.571
Yeah.

14:34.275 --> 14:35.581
Clear!

14:36.697 --> 14:38.602
- Still v-fib.
- Damn it.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.651
- She's 88 years old.
- Yeah, I tried to make that point an hour ago.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.521
- We're committed now.
- Lido's in.

14:43.535 --> 14:44.833
All right, another mig of epi.

14:44.847 --> 14:47.572
- She's had five rounds of meds.
- Yeah, well, let's make it six.

14:48.708 --> 14:50.172
We never should have brought her up here.

14:50.186 --> 14:53.911
- Darling, it's the job.
- Oh, spare me the platitudes, okay?

14:53.926 --> 14:55.730
Go again. Go !

14:56.947 --> 14:57.891
Clear!

15:00.235 --> 15:01.623
Nothing.

15:36.877 --> 15:39.481
If the scar shows above my bikini,
I'm suing both your asses.

15:39.488 --> 15:41.452
Need some help here!
Ladies, we're in a hospital now.

15:41.465 --> 15:43.860
- Time to grow up.
- Don't tell me what to do, Grandma.

15:43.877 --> 15:46.182
- Grandma?
- You bobble-headed little bitch!

15:46.577 --> 15:48.522
Okay, let's settle down.
All right, what happened?

15:48.537 --> 15:50.602
- She pushed me into the display.
- I fell, she fell.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.463
These three were fighting over a bag
at Bovards' midnight sale.

15:53.478 --> 15:55.952
- All right, come on. Let's go.
- Midnight sale? It's not even 8:00 yet.

15:55.975 --> 15:58.402
The name's just tradition.
It starts at 4:00 in the afternoon now.

15:58.406 --> 16:00.213
Bendi Brioche 80% off.

16:00.238 --> 16:03.072
- Normally $1,800.
- They only did a limited run.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.883
Somehow during the scuffle,
Mandy fell into the nativity display.

16:05.897 --> 16:08.793
- I was pushed.
- Nativity display? It's Thanksgiving.

16:08.857 --> 16:11.102
Yeah, well, that's when
the Christmas decorations go up.

16:11.126 --> 16:13.681
Impaled by a fiberglass
Star of Bethlehem.

16:13.707 --> 16:14.911
Jane, call surgery.

16:14.947 --> 16:17.710
With all that's happened,
I can't keep this now.

16:18.056 --> 16:19.983
Oh, that's so sweet, honey.

16:20.586 --> 16:23.110
Give it back, evil grandma whore.

16:23.906 --> 16:27.022
Wow, this is really sad.

16:29.567 --> 16:31.932
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:32.608 --> 16:35.392
I was just calling to say it's still probably going to be a while.

16:35.406 --> 16:36.922
Are you okay?

16:37.735 --> 16:38.942
Abby?

16:40.858 --> 16:43.221
Abby? You there?

16:43.307 --> 16:46.531
Don't worry.
We're taking good care of your girl.

16:47.276 --> 16:48.932
Are you listening?

16:49.177 --> 16:50.470
Who's that?

16:50.928 --> 16:52.992
You guys are assholes.

16:53.005 --> 16:55.992
- Abby?
- Luka, I'll call you when we land.

16:56.618 --> 16:57.881
Hang up the phone.

16:57.907 --> 17:00.173
- You didn't say good-bye.
- Hang up the phone!

17:00.558 --> 17:01.932
Sorry about that.

17:01.977 --> 17:05.750
- I accidentally mixed up my channels.
- What, are we in fifth grade here?

17:05.785 --> 17:09.492
- Airmedic 6, dispatch.
- Airmedic 6.

17:09.508 --> 17:14.393
Airmedic 6, we have a report of a vehicle
over the side of Highway 16 at Neosha Ravine.

17:14.406 --> 17:15.811
Are you available?

17:19.395 --> 17:23.232
- Why aren't you answering her?
- We're about to time out.

17:23.246 --> 17:25.912
Pilots are only allowed to fly
for a max of 12 hours.

17:25.928 --> 17:27.792
I've been up for almost 11.

17:28.888 --> 17:30.292
Airmedic 6?

17:33.275 --> 17:35.222
So you're just going to ignore her?

17:35.238 --> 17:37.553
Don't worry.
Another unit will get it.

17:37.565 --> 17:40.451
Yeah, but we're not far from Neosha.

17:42.738 --> 17:44.523
Tell her where we are.

17:45.385 --> 17:47.270
You don't have to look
to Daddy for permission.

17:47.288 --> 17:50.241
Just do your job and
tell her where we are.

17:50.835 --> 17:54.373
Dispatch, Airmedic 6.
We're at Highway 12 and county line.

17:54.387 --> 17:57.990
- Are we the closest unit?
- Airmedic 6, that's affirmative.

17:58.206 --> 17:59.821
Then put us on the call.

17:59.838 --> 18:02.010
Airmedic 6,
you're assigned to the incident.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.532
Who is this?

18:04.045 --> 18:08.993
Abby Lockhart. I'm the doctor
on board and we're responding.

18:10.877 --> 18:13.131
Darling, it's the job.

18:19.036 --> 18:22.333
No free air, no fluid.
Looks like the star missed the peritoneum.

18:22.378 --> 18:25.602
The Thanksgiving sales, the parades,
the blockbuster movies.

18:25.616 --> 18:29.653
Those are all just to prime you for the bald-
faced commercialism of the holiday season.

18:29.836 --> 18:31.202
Syringe.

18:32.518 --> 18:34.170
Lidocaine, 1%.

18:34.198 --> 18:36.482
- Your wounds are superficial.
- You got lucky.

18:36.498 --> 18:37.802
Yeah, right.

18:37.815 --> 18:41.573
By the time I get back to the sale, all they'll
have left are bad colors and big sizes.

18:41.586 --> 18:44.201
You were impaled while fighting
over an overpriced vessel

18:44.215 --> 18:48.272
for credit cards and lipstick.
Doesn't that sorta kinda feel like a sign?

18:48.305 --> 18:49.530
Wake up.

18:52.615 --> 18:55.903
A gram of Ancef, 3-0 silk
and irrigation tray.

18:57.867 --> 19:00.432
Jane, uh, stay and assist the doctor.

19:06.207 --> 19:08.091
We should be close!

19:23.178 --> 19:25.450
She said "vehicle," not "bus."

19:25.878 --> 19:27.192
Cheap trick.

19:27.218 --> 19:29.711
How are we supposed to get down there?

20:36.777 --> 20:41.931
If you're taking that long to find
a pulse, it's not worth looking.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.703
Don't waste time with resuscitations.

20:44.836 --> 20:48.311
- Help the people you can help.
- I know how to triage. Thank you.

20:48.325 --> 20:50.401
That bus is unstable.

20:50.605 --> 20:54.013
Keep triaging
until the cavalry gets here.

20:55.175 --> 20:57.122
Help-- my arm!

20:57.136 --> 21:00.730
It won't stop.
I'm telling you, it won't stop.

21:00.755 --> 21:03.423
Okay, okay, okay, let me see.
Let me see.

21:04.826 --> 21:06.752
Just sit down.
Sit down.

21:06.778 --> 21:09.583
Keep pressure on this
and keep your arm up, okay?

21:09.607 --> 21:12.470
We're all gonna freeze
to death out here!

21:12.486 --> 21:14.473
We're gonna get you out
of the cold soon, okay?

21:14.485 --> 21:18.402
How?!
Help! Please! Somebody!

21:20.067 --> 21:22.930
- Over here!
- Stay like that.

21:22.955 --> 21:24.772
- Stay like...
- Wait! Wait!

21:25.078 --> 21:27.643
- I don't know what to do!
- Are more people coming?

21:28.028 --> 21:31.511
- What's the plan? Do you have a plan?
- His foot is pointing the wrong way.

21:33.555 --> 21:35.433
Can you tell me what your name is?

21:35.458 --> 21:37.822
- It's Matt.
- Hi, Matt.

21:38.236 --> 21:41.101
- I'm Abby. I'm a doctor.
- Hey, doc.

21:41.115 --> 21:42.902
No, no, no, no, don't move.
Don't move.

21:42.916 --> 21:46.142
Can you hold his head like this?
Make sure he doesn't move his neck.

21:46.155 --> 21:49.412
I can't feel my leg!
Oh, God.

21:50.186 --> 21:52.470
- Can you move your feet at all?
- No!

21:52.837 --> 21:54.502
- Baby, no!
- It's all right.

21:54.505 --> 21:57.353
I'm gonna go find something
to splint your leg with, okay?

21:57.595 --> 22:02.133
Help! Somebody...
Somebody help!

22:02.148 --> 22:04.343
Please! Help!

22:04.998 --> 22:09.373
Mom, don't close your eyes.
Stay awake, somebody's coming.

22:09.387 --> 22:13.013
- Mom? Mom!
- All right, don't move.

22:13.027 --> 22:17.030
- I'm gonna come back there.
- Mom, she's here now! It's gonna be okay!

22:21.195 --> 22:22.390
Hello?!

22:24.225 --> 22:27.240
- Are you hurt, too?
- No, it's just my mom. Please.

22:27.255 --> 22:29.262
- Hang on.
- You got to get her out.

22:30.525 --> 22:32.762
Mom, it's okay.

22:33.828 --> 22:35.761
Please get her out.

22:37.735 --> 22:39.262
I'm Abby.

22:39.535 --> 22:41.023
I'm a doctor.

22:42.668 --> 22:45.082
- Can you tell me your name?
- Melanie.

22:49.665 --> 22:52.902
- Melanie, can you move at all?
- She's stuck!

23:06.825 --> 23:09.803
Okay. We're gonna get you out
of here, all right?

23:10.175 --> 23:12.362
- Come on. Let's go!
- Are you ready?

23:12.555 --> 23:16.002
One, two, three.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.593
Is... Is that all my blood?

23:27.406 --> 23:28.613
I don't know.

23:28.937 --> 23:30.951
I don't know where
that blood's coming from.

23:31.735 --> 23:33.573
Come on. Fix her!

23:41.876 --> 23:43.413
I can't.

23:44.388 --> 23:47.762
I can't move you now.

23:48.288 --> 23:51.703
- I understand.
- Okay.

23:53.547 --> 23:56.543
- You should take Milo out.
- No! I won't go!

23:56.555 --> 23:59.530
- Baby, go with the doctor.
- No!

23:59.828 --> 24:02.823
Milo, there are people coming with
special equipment. They're gonna help us.

24:02.838 --> 24:05.993
- And I'll wait here with her!
- Milo, I love you.

24:06.265 --> 24:11.403
- This is gonna help you with the pain.
- I need you to be a brave boy now, okay?

24:14.257 --> 24:17.621
- Please, just get him off this bus!
- No!

24:18.057 --> 24:20.613
- Go with the doctor, baby.
- No.

24:21.048 --> 24:23.393
- Milo...
- You can be a good helper.

24:23.405 --> 24:25.620
- No!
- Go ahead.

24:25.637 --> 24:27.030
Milo, come on.

24:29.005 --> 24:31.140
Please, just make sure he's okay.

24:31.656 --> 24:33.253
Let's go, now. Come on.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.833
- No!
- Let's go. Watch your head.

24:49.027 --> 24:50.920
See, I told you it wouldn't hurt.

24:54.567 --> 24:57.052
It's my mom.
She won't stop calling me.

24:57.117 --> 24:58.482
You're lucky.

24:59.035 --> 25:02.743
My foster mother only keeps me for
the money she gets from the state.

25:03.266 --> 25:05.861
When I started barfing at dinner, she...

25:05.878 --> 25:09.311
loaded me into the ambulance
and then went back to her ham.

25:09.597 --> 25:12.750
So... she's not coming.

25:12.778 --> 25:16.581
- That boy is smitten.
- Boys are easy.

25:17.207 --> 25:19.440
You know, Meg and Sarah
are out of town tonight?

25:19.457 --> 25:20.963
Liver looks good.

25:20.978 --> 25:23.042
Which means I have
the place all to myself.

25:23.058 --> 25:27.083
- And why are you telling me this?
- 'Cause Meg and I, it's over.

25:27.085 --> 25:29.160
I thought you weren't together.

25:29.696 --> 25:33.562
We weren't. But now we're not
even not together anymore.

25:35.027 --> 25:39.423
- Fat stranding and a cecal phlegmon.
- She needs the OR. I'll call Crenshaw.

25:41.397 --> 25:42.443
Sit down.

25:44.306 --> 25:47.152
I have a very important job
for you, okay?

25:47.356 --> 25:49.480
I don't want my mom to be alone.

25:49.495 --> 25:54.070
I want you to take that flashlight,
and point it wherever I'm working.

25:54.107 --> 25:55.743
Someone's gonna help her, right?

25:57.348 --> 25:59.590
The fire department's gonna be here soon.

25:59.877 --> 26:01.522
And they'll get her off the bus?

26:01.817 --> 26:02.951
Yeah.

26:03.807 --> 26:05.222
Promise?

26:07.495 --> 26:09.880
All right, don't move, okay?

26:10.775 --> 26:12.651
Just shine that light at me.

27:20.758 --> 27:26.941
Four dead, nine criticals,
14 minor injuries, 11 delayed.

27:27.576 --> 27:31.552
The driver had a passenger manifest,
and the numbers all match up.

27:31.565 --> 27:34.470
Good job. Good job.
All the criticals are off site.

27:34.485 --> 27:36.623
Does this include
the woman on the bus?

27:37.148 --> 27:39.771
No one's going back on that bus
until it's stabilized.

27:39.836 --> 27:41.501
Well, how long is that gonna take?

27:41.725 --> 27:44.153
The anchors aren't holding;
it could be hours.

27:44.207 --> 27:46.880
- She can't make it that long.
- There's nothing we can do about it!

27:46.896 --> 27:49.672
- We are not gonna endanger our guys!
- Calm down.

27:49.678 --> 27:52.110
Hey, nobody's getting back on that bus!

27:52.408 --> 27:55.502
- But she promised!
- She said you guys would go back!

27:55.518 --> 27:58.553
- Oh, yeah, what else you tell him?!
- Why don't you just back off...?

27:58.578 --> 28:00.032
- Mom!
- Hey! Hey!

28:00.048 --> 28:01.360
Mom!

28:02.768 --> 28:03.800
Milo!

28:05.098 --> 28:06.720
Hey! Hey!

28:08.327 --> 28:12.531
Milo, you... Milo, you cannot
get on that bus right now!

28:12.546 --> 28:14.633
- You said they would get her.
- I know.

28:14.656 --> 28:17.423
- You said they'd try.
- Okay.

28:17.547 --> 28:20.230
- You said they'd try.
- I know. It's gonna be okay.

28:21.896 --> 28:25.671
Come on, guys. Give him to me.
Pass him down.

28:26.057 --> 28:28.423
No! No!

28:39.486 --> 28:41.923
Get away!

28:45.058 --> 28:46.122
Melanie?

28:49.468 --> 28:52.983
- Melanie? Can you hear me?
- Milo, he can't...

28:55.767 --> 28:58.700
All right.
All right, everything's gonna be okay.

28:58.715 --> 29:01.652
- No, it's...
- Everything's gonna be all right.

29:01.746 --> 29:02.911
Hey!

29:03.205 --> 29:06.613
I need an IV and a liter of NS in here!

29:07.218 --> 29:09.871
His dad's in Milwaukee.

29:10.175 --> 29:12.872
- Would you... please tell him...
- Okay, Melanie.

29:13.116 --> 29:15.710
Melanie, listen to me.
Help is on the way, all right?

29:16.316 --> 29:20.781
Milo... Milo likes it...
if you break up his toast...

29:20.795 --> 29:23.572
- and scramble it with his eggs.
- Okay.

29:23.588 --> 29:27.093
He'll only let you comb his hair...

29:27.107 --> 29:30.773
if he's wearing his Ronaldinho jersey.

29:40.646 --> 29:42.160
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
No, no, no.

29:42.178 --> 29:46.640
Melanie, stay with me. Melanie, come on.
Stay with me.

29:46.658 --> 29:49.770
Melanie, tell me some more about Milo.
What does Milo like?

29:50.566 --> 29:54.162
He... he likes to sleep with
an inchworm named Charlie.

29:54.175 --> 29:57.173
- Okay, that's good. What else?
- Trying to get us all killed?

29:58.097 --> 30:00.441
I'm trying to keep her alive.

30:00.446 --> 30:03.330
- You are out of your mind.
- Well, what are you doing here?

30:03.336 --> 30:05.430
Thought you might need this.

30:14.297 --> 30:18.141
Hey, Katey, it's me.
Uh, I think you have my cell phone.

30:18.155 --> 30:22.081
Want to come by later and pick it up,
if that's okay. Call me.

30:22.415 --> 30:28.030
Marsupialized the abscess on your shooter,
sent the implanted chip to pathology,

30:28.047 --> 30:32.872
convinced Captain Kangaroo to stop eating
erasers, and what's the deal with the new nurse?

30:33.025 --> 30:34.690
- You mean Jane?
- Yeah.

30:34.706 --> 30:38.213
- What about her?
- Nothing. You know, just wondering.

30:38.227 --> 30:39.452
You like her.

30:39.857 --> 30:42.503
- Quiet, you silly infant.
- What about radiology?

30:42.518 --> 30:44.251
Alex loves the fluoroscope.

30:44.407 --> 30:47.901
- I went there. Nobody's seen him.
- Okay, can you check MRI?

30:47.917 --> 30:50.053
The tech there lets him
man the controls sometimes.

30:50.056 --> 30:51.711
Sam, I got work to do.

30:51.715 --> 30:55.142
Jasmine Chastek, 17, fell down
a couple steps, positive LOC.

30:55.146 --> 30:57.641
- Hey, I'm Dr. Barnett.
- What happened?

30:57.658 --> 31:00.413
We were doing hits of nitrous
from whipped cream cans at Grandma's.

31:00.418 --> 31:02.913
She went a little overboard,
passed out on the basement stairs.

31:02.927 --> 31:04.853
Okay, this should clean up just fine.

31:04.865 --> 31:09.411
Uh, I have to go find Alex.
Teenagers are such idiots.

31:14.176 --> 31:15.740
Push harder!

31:16.166 --> 31:18.010
It's stuck!

31:24.755 --> 31:26.231
Come on!

31:46.356 --> 31:47.701
Got to go!

31:49.266 --> 31:50.783
Now!

32:12.068 --> 32:15.022
- Can I have a cookie?
- Uh, yeah, but they really suck.

32:15.036 --> 32:17.003
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

32:17.308 --> 32:20.402
- Listen, your mom's looking for you.
- Ah, man, now I'm in trouble.

32:20.418 --> 32:21.943
No, she'll understand.

32:21.977 --> 32:24.530
No, I mean, everything I do
makes her angry.

32:24.546 --> 32:27.301
Sometimes you have to go
the extra mile for a girl.

32:27.586 --> 32:29.343
She'll get it. Trust me.

32:29.425 --> 32:31.630
Lulu's in recovery.
She's doing fine.

32:31.648 --> 32:32.653
Good.

32:33.638 --> 32:35.842
- Go get her.
- Yeah.

32:37.078 --> 32:39.203
We're getting a critical victim
in from a bus crash.

32:39.218 --> 32:41.123
I've got to go meet
a helicopter on the roof.

32:43.077 --> 32:44.910
Don't you need to be in the ER
or something?

32:44.915 --> 32:47.791
- No, my shift ended hours ago.
- Well, what are you still doing here?

32:47.805 --> 32:49.692
Waiting for you, dummy.

32:50.265 --> 32:52.902
Tony, you know, it's going to be a while.
I've got to get sign-out;

32:52.908 --> 32:54.370
- then I've got to take the patient to CT...
- All right, here's the deal.

32:54.386 --> 32:56.002
You're going home with me tonight.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.021
Why is that the deal?

32:58.038 --> 33:02.433
Because there's nobody at my house.
It's Thanksgiving.

33:03.706 --> 33:08.922
And I really, really want
to make you... dinner.

33:16.235 --> 33:20.681
Okay, chocolate cherry.
Amazing, right?

33:20.735 --> 33:22.993
- Wow.
- Looks great to me.

33:23.005 --> 33:24.332
Hey, Greg.

33:24.356 --> 33:27.681
- Hey, I'm Dr. Greg Pratt.
- Oh, nice to meet you. Courtney Brown.

33:27.698 --> 33:30.200
- Courtney is my producer at Channel 5.
- Wow.

33:30.266 --> 33:32.392
You know, I think I might be able
to hang out for a while,

33:32.406 --> 33:34.171
if I can get my neighbor
to let the dog out.

33:34.185 --> 33:35.742
- I'll give her a call.
- Great.

33:38.648 --> 33:41.811
- Who is that?
- I just told you who she was.

33:42.477 --> 33:45.032
Come on, now, hook a brother up.

33:45.058 --> 33:49.440
You know what, your gaydar is
terrible, even for a straight man.

33:52.488 --> 33:53.982
Oh, well, you...

33:54.275 --> 33:56.670
You have excellent taste
in women, Dr. Weaver.

33:56.686 --> 33:57.891
Of course I do.

33:58.487 --> 33:59.740
Hey, uh...

34:01.655 --> 34:03.231
Can I ask you something personal?

34:03.237 --> 34:04.580
Maybe.

34:06.386 --> 34:08.992
All right. How, um...

34:09.996 --> 34:11.681
No, no.

34:12.195 --> 34:15.429
When... did you know you were gay?

34:16.585 --> 34:18.840
Are you coming out to me, Greg?

34:18.864 --> 34:23.199
No, no, no, no. I came home and found
my brother with another guy.

34:24.647 --> 34:27.303
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:27.678 --> 34:31.060
He says he's just experimenting,
that it's only a phase.

34:31.826 --> 34:35.152
- And what do you think?
- I don't know.

34:35.208 --> 34:37.931
Can a straight guy
go through a gay phase?

34:38.706 --> 34:42.273
I think it's more likely that he's gay.

34:43.068 --> 34:46.781
Hey, and he's telling you
what he thinks you want to hear.

34:47.226 --> 34:49.070
Okay, but for today, right,

34:49.074 --> 34:51.771
he's taking some hot girl from
school to the family Thanksgiving.

34:51.784 --> 34:54.601
Now, if he was gay,
why is he doing that?

34:54.617 --> 34:58.720
I don't know your brother. I mean,
I-I don't know what's going on in his head,

34:58.735 --> 35:04.250
but I do know that when I was that age,
I brought a lot of boys home to meet my parents.

35:04.708 --> 35:06.670
- You did?
- Hell, yeah.

35:06.685 --> 35:10.570
I mean, I was 30 before
I faced up to being gay,

35:10.585 --> 35:14.003
but my life got a lot better once I did.

35:38.505 --> 35:40.301
- Hey, Abby.
- Hey.

35:40.315 --> 35:43.871
- Your transport go okay?
- Um... yes.

35:44.207 --> 35:46.322
Well, be grateful you got
to skip out on this freak show.

35:46.335 --> 35:50.533
- It's been a real madhouse around here.
- Just got lucky, I guess.

35:50.925 --> 35:52.402
Hey, Lockhart.

35:53.536 --> 35:56.792
Hurry up and sign this
before I get called out again.

36:04.195 --> 36:05.322
Bye.

36:06.686 --> 36:08.251
And thanks.

36:09.706 --> 36:11.692
You're pretty tough for a girl.

36:15.255 --> 36:17.011
Go to hell.

36:51.496 --> 36:53.113
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:53.646 --> 36:55.052
I was afraid you weren't
going to show up.

36:55.066 --> 36:57.881
Sorry, Crenshaw made me do
an I&D on my way out.

36:58.805 --> 37:00.701
Come on in.
Hope you're hungry.

37:00.907 --> 37:03.370
Couldn't do the turkey
thing so I made tacos.

37:08.745 --> 37:12.972
Homemade salsa, I got these tortillas
from the Salvadorian market on Fulton.

37:13.005 --> 37:15.191
- You ever been there?
- Uh, don't think so.

37:15.277 --> 37:16.890
Some wine.

37:21.736 --> 37:22.981
You okay?

37:23.716 --> 37:26.330
- Uh, yeah.
- Some more wine.

37:28.328 --> 37:30.590
- Want to take your jacket off?
- Uh, yeah.

37:30.606 --> 37:31.632
All right.

37:31.718 --> 37:33.692
Are you sure you're cool?
'Cause if you don't like Mexican food,

37:33.708 --> 37:37.762
- just say the word and you know.
- No, I'm fine. Really.

37:37.777 --> 37:41.552
It's just I haven't been in
a situation like this for a long time.

37:41.557 --> 37:43.802
- I know.
- It just feels a bit weird standing here

37:43.806 --> 37:45.973
knowing we're about to do
what we're about to do.

37:45.996 --> 37:47.531
What? Have dinner?

37:47.748 --> 37:50.372
Tony, I-I want to be here, I do.

37:51.128 --> 37:53.020
I mean, I've thought about it a lot.

37:53.035 --> 37:56.701
Not creepy-a-lot, but it's definitely
been on my mind

37:56.718 --> 38:00.492
and I wouldn't want you to be
worried that I don't really want...

38:05.456 --> 38:06.820
I'm not worried.

38:08.096 --> 38:10.070
We can take it as slow as you want.

38:13.277 --> 38:14.680
Slow?

38:26.016 --> 38:30.140
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey. Well, thank you.

38:30.436 --> 38:33.012
- And what are you doing here?
- Working.

38:33.508 --> 38:36.721
Surgeons are such bastards making
med students come in on Thanksgiving.

38:36.736 --> 38:38.103
That is really, really low.

38:38.115 --> 38:42.030
No, actually, it's the bastards in the ER
who scheduled me for this.

38:42.045 --> 38:44.912
- What?
- I started an ER rotation.

38:45.336 --> 38:46.520
Tonight.

38:49.607 --> 38:51.971
Now, see, you said
you were never going to...

38:51.977 --> 38:55.012
Yeah, radiology fell through at
the last minute. I got reassigned.

38:55.028 --> 38:56.451
Don't freak out.
I'm not stalking you.

38:56.468 --> 38:59.152
- Okay, look, I can't evaluate you.
- We'll work it out.

38:59.158 --> 39:00.511
And I can't have these people thinking...

39:00.525 --> 39:02.522
- We'll work it out.
- Okay.

39:04.058 --> 39:05.533
Hey, Abby.

39:05.608 --> 39:07.330
What took so long?
You were out all night.

39:07.948 --> 39:10.883
Well, you know, sometimes
these things can take hours.

39:10.975 --> 39:13.130
You sure you weren't just having
sundaes with the team?

39:13.488 --> 39:16.590
Last run I did we burned off
the whole shift at the Plush Horse.

39:17.418 --> 39:18.882
Good for you, Ray.

39:19.216 --> 39:21.702
Well, well, well, look who's back.

39:21.807 --> 39:25.821
She got to soar over Chicago while we
dealt with maggots and colostomy bags.

39:25.836 --> 39:28.600
I guess I must have done
something good in a past life.

39:28.615 --> 39:31.663
Yeah, well, you look wiped. Transports can
do that to you if you're not used to it.

39:31.675 --> 39:33.391
- So you want me to get you a coffee? Or...
- No, thanks.

39:33.408 --> 39:35.740
Right now I really just want to go home.

39:35.756 --> 39:38.352
No, stay. We just got here.

39:41.705 --> 39:43.511
I missed you guys.

39:53.478 --> 39:57.010
I know we had no water or toilet paper...

39:58.805 --> 40:00.460
Oh, my God.

40:03.045 --> 40:05.130
Meg, Sarah, this is Neela.

40:14.828 --> 40:16.573
How many times do I have
to tell you, Tony?

40:16.588 --> 40:20.673
When you leave the glass directly
on the wood, it leaves a stain.

40:30.925 --> 40:32.730
- You hungry?
- Yeah, I'm starving.

40:32.747 --> 40:34.432
All right, let me get my stuff,
and then, uh,

40:34.448 --> 40:36.291
we can pick up something
at the chicken place.

40:43.216 --> 40:45.842
Sam, Alex, Happy Thanksgiving.

40:45.855 --> 40:47.722
There's some food over there,
help yourselves.

40:47.736 --> 40:49.582
Wow, thanks, Luka.

40:50.618 --> 40:53.622
- Tofurkey anyone?
- Uh... no.

40:53.635 --> 40:56.150
- I'll try it.
- Are you really a vegan?

40:56.155 --> 40:59.111
Surgeons just shouldn't be carnivores.
It's a known fact.

41:00.437 --> 41:03.400
- What the hell is that?
- Looks like milk Jell-O.

41:03.416 --> 41:06.813
Mmm, no, coconut flan and it is killer.

41:07.576 --> 41:09.891
Oh, hey, Dr. Weaver, do you remember me?

41:09.905 --> 41:11.901
- Katey Alvaro.
- Oh, hi, Katey. How are you?

41:11.918 --> 41:14.821
I'm good. Um, I started my ER
rotation about an hour ago.

41:14.836 --> 41:18.061
Oh, yeah, well, I hope Ray's
giving you the lay of the land.

41:18.078 --> 41:19.941
Oh, yeah, he is. Definitely.

41:20.705 --> 41:24.331
All right, how do you stay
so skinny and eat so much?

41:24.346 --> 41:26.400
Uh, look who's talking,
little skinny mini.

41:26.416 --> 41:28.582
Well, it seems like good genes to me.

41:28.676 --> 41:31.852
You want to come over and watch some
football with me and Kerry tomorrow?

41:32.988 --> 41:34.751
Damn, you're lucky.

41:38.037 --> 41:42.072
- I can't believe you made all this.
- Well, maybe I cheated a little.

41:44.206 --> 41:46.112
If anything happens to me
you'll remember that

41:46.126 --> 41:48.940
Joe likes strawberries but raspberries
give him hives, right?

41:48.957 --> 41:50.301
- What are you talking about?
- And...

41:50.315 --> 41:53.332
and if you put the ceiling fan on in the
bathroom, he doesn't cry when he's in tube.

41:53.347 --> 41:55.851
- I know that.
- And it's absolutely mandatory

41:55.867 --> 41:58.871
that he be exposed to everything
Stevie Wonder recorded in the '70s.

41:58.888 --> 42:03.182
Dr. Lockhart, that trauma
you choppered in did well in the OR.

42:03.195 --> 42:05.302
Oh, great. That's great.

42:05.317 --> 42:09.060
Yeah, it required over 12 units but,
uh, she's holding her own in recovery.

42:09.076 --> 42:10.111
Thanks.

42:11.615 --> 42:14.541
Are you okay?
How did the transport go?

42:20.117 --> 42:22.333
Hey, I have my kid here.

42:25.436 --> 42:27.881
It's Thanksgiving.
I'll tell you tomorrow.

42:42.305 --> 42:44.600
