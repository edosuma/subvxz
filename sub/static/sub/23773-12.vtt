FILM 12

01:08.800 --> 01:12.080
<i>Revenge makes the nights longer,</i>

01:12.560 --> 01:14.760
<i>but knives make them shorter.</i>

03:59.720 --> 04:01.240
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

04:02.840 --> 04:04.240
<i>I love you.</i>

04:11.760 --> 04:13.760
Correct me if I’m wrong.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.519
After all of your stories,

04:17.600 --> 04:22.560
I’m even more sure
that Meglin’s moral compass was broken.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.840
Do you understand what I’m saying?

04:38.760 --> 04:39.960
Not really.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.120
You’ve lost your frame of reference.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.720
It’s not that you lost it.
It’s that you found… a new one.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.520
It’s not like ours.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.720
He pitied the criminals
more than the victims.

04:55.160 --> 04:58.680
Maybe it depends on who the criminals
and who the victims are.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.560
Are you also justifying murder?

05:05.600 --> 05:08.000
In certain cases, yes.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.960
VLADIMIR OPERA HOUSE

05:13.040 --> 05:15.440
I don’t understand--

05:16.360 --> 05:18.080
Have you been to the theater before?

05:18.160 --> 05:19.920
Of course. Once.

05:20.800 --> 05:24.400
When I was at the orphanage,
they took us to <i>Swan Lake</i>.

05:24.480 --> 05:27.920
Stop, stop, stop! There. And higher!

05:28.000 --> 05:29.840
Higher, higher, higher!

05:29.920 --> 05:31.320
We’re losing time!

05:32.400 --> 05:35.280
-Are you from the Saratov Theater?
-Yes.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.080
Excellent. Let’s go.
I’ll explain everything on the way.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.640
We have an urgent entrance!

05:40.720 --> 05:42.160
It’s an aerial descent.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.480
You’re the aristocracy of Pompeii.
Is that clear?

05:44.560 --> 05:48.880
It’s Pompeii. Our tone is tragic.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.280
You’re the aristocracy.

05:50.360 --> 05:54.120
It’s dawn, and then suddenly
there’s such a punishment!

05:54.200 --> 05:56.920
And the question arises: why?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.440
It comes up in your roles.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.880
Why?

06:00.960 --> 06:03.320
-And I have to make it clear.
-Well, of course.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.680
Moral decadence.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.960
By the way, I have your parts ready.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.880
The role of Othello is coming open.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.200
There’s been an epidemic of bronchitis,
so we called you immediately.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.640
By the way, with your looks,
you could play any part.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.960
So, as a formality,
the director will see you, and that’s it.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.320
Enter.

06:25.400 --> 06:29.600
Come in. We’re in such a bad situation.
It couldn’t be worse!

06:29.680 --> 06:32.000
There’s been an epidemic of bronchitis.

06:32.080 --> 06:35.880
Half of the company is sick,
and right before the premiere.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.240
You called us on account of bronchitis?
That’s not our job. That’s the clinic’s.

06:40.840 --> 06:43.480
If that were the only epidemic.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.400
People have disappeared.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.760
Anton Avdeyev and his wife Victoria.

06:49.360 --> 06:53.440
He’s a very famous lawyer in the city
and a member of our board.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.080
I pulled all kinds of strings
to get you here.

06:57.160 --> 07:00.040
Unfortunately, that’s not our job either.
We don’t look for missing people.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.840
But this isn’t the first case.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.320
The cases
just weren’t tied together earlier.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.400
I’m listening.

07:09.480 --> 07:13.280
Igor Ignatich Sysoev
went missing in January.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.360
He’s also a member of the board.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.160
The police said
he had some business troubles,

07:19.240 --> 07:23.240
but now it somehow looks…
like something else.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.680
Vadik, this is too much to bear!
How much can I bear?

07:27.760 --> 07:30.120
Why is my makeup artist being changed
an hour before I go on?

07:30.200 --> 07:33.120
Mikhael, I’m sorry. I called Zhanna.
She was supposed to call back.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.640
Why are you talking about Zhanna? I need
the makeup artist I’ve had all year.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.720
-Is that really unclear?
-I’ll call Zhanna.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.640
Can you introduce me? Hello.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.600
Mikhael Ptakha, our lead tenor.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.560
-And this is--
-A colleague of yours. From the Saratov.

07:50.640 --> 07:51.640
I’m also a tenor.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.080
Not as gifted as you, of course,
but not everyone has it.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.920
-Do you want to replace me?
-Mikhael.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.960
I’m joking. I’m irreplaceable.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.440
And you aren’t really a tenor.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.120
You’re a baritone.

08:05.720 --> 08:08.000
You’re smoking in here. It’s not allowed.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.520
Are you a cop or something?

08:10.600 --> 08:13.120
Mikhael,
I’m sending you the best makeup artist!

08:13.200 --> 08:15.160
Why are you always trying
to get rid of me?

08:15.240 --> 08:17.840
-Maybe I’ll just quit the theater!
-Mikhael!

08:20.600 --> 08:22.200
It’s not our problem.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
Go see Shtikh.

08:24.480 --> 08:27.000
-Please, let us talk!
-Go see Shtikh!

08:31.640 --> 08:32.679
Excuse me.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.840
-Shtikh-- the one and the same?
-Yes, yes. The banker.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.280
Gennady Abramych.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.520
He’s president of the opera’s board.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.800
He’s supported the theater for many years.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.480
Why does your tenor hate him so much?

08:55.800 --> 08:59.960
Go ahead and talk to the administrator.
I’ll talk to the… bohemian.

09:01.360 --> 09:02.560
What should I find out?

09:02.920 --> 09:06.040
Find out who’s on their list
of privileged guests.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.600
Who it’s all for, basically.

09:08.240 --> 09:12.040
And find out which dedicated attendees
suddenly stopped coming to performances.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.520
We’ll talk at lunch.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.920
You don’t eat lunch.
We’ll talk after your third glass.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.280
You’re overestimating me.
We’ll talk after my second glass.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.960
Maybe I’m overestimating you.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.640
-Can we take these?
-Please.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.120
Why are you standing around? Get to work.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.760
I’m going.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.440
Do you have a minute?

09:51.960 --> 09:53.760
Why are you doing my brows so high?

09:53.840 --> 09:56.600
How many times do I have to tell you?
I’ll do it myself. Go.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.680
EUGENE ONEGIN
MIKHAEL PTAKHA

09:59.480 --> 10:00.200
Come in.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.640
Have you and Shtikh had a falling-out?

10:11.840 --> 10:13.040
So, yes?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.920
As far as I can tell,

10:18.720 --> 10:22.600
Gennady Abramych’s sexual preferences
are of a different type.

10:23.760 --> 10:25.320
I, of course, can’t confirm it,

10:26.000 --> 10:29.640
but if someone could commit a murder,
or arrange a murder,

10:29.720 --> 10:31.440
then it would be Shtikh.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.040
He doesn’t let anything get in his way,

10:34.720 --> 10:37.120
and he has the morals of a dinosaur.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.800
Was this epidemic also his work?

10:41.360 --> 10:45.280
Well,
I don’t think his power reaches that far.

10:47.080 --> 10:52.320
Maybe Avdeyeva and Sysoev found out
something and he got rid of them.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.920
What would they have found out?

11:02.480 --> 11:05.400
What, am I going to tell you everything?

11:06.480 --> 11:07.680
You’re the hound.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.080
You search.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.000
I don’t ask you to sing my role for me.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.920
Not that I could.

11:21.000 --> 11:21.800
I’m a baritone.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.600
Mikhael.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.560
Excuse me. Five minutes.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.600
-I’m sorry. I have to get ready.
-Of course.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.120
“The Muses’ service brooks no vanity.”

11:38.960 --> 11:39.960
I’m sorry.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.000
Bye.

12:00.840 --> 12:04.800
I got 10 names, but there’s only
one definite match so far.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.680
Tetyokhin, the music critic,
went missing a year ago.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.320
The company was sure he’d gone to India.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.200
-But the police have a different theory.
-Which is?

12:13.280 --> 12:17.200
His car was found outside the city
with the keys in the ignition.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.280
You know what?

12:19.360 --> 12:20.600
I don’t know. Tell me.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.680
Tetyokhin was a friend of Shtikh.

12:25.480 --> 12:28.640
Now it’s time
to visit this philanthropist, no?

12:55.360 --> 12:56.360
Please.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.000
-Gennady Abramych!
-Why are you shouting?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
-He’s coming down now.
-All right.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.720
-Would you like anything?
-Not now, thank you.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.520
Definitely later.

13:53.280 --> 13:56.080
That’s Tetyokhin.
The photo from the director’s office. Sorry it took me so long. Work.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.560
Did they offer you a drink?

14:16.640 --> 14:17.640
Of course.

14:18.680 --> 14:21.320
Let’s not disturb them. Please.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.160
Now maybe let’s get to business.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.600
Well, yeah.

14:37.680 --> 14:40.560
Was Tetyokhin, the critic, your friend?

14:41.400 --> 14:42.600
Why “was”?

14:43.200 --> 14:47.200
I heard he went to India.
Did something happen to him?

14:48.400 --> 14:50.560
Did he write you
or keep in touch by phone?

14:51.800 --> 14:54.000
We weren’t that close.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.680
I have another idea.

14:57.760 --> 14:58.960
Although…

15:00.960 --> 15:02.640
Banker and critic.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.200
Fire and ice. What brought you two together?

15:09.960 --> 15:11.680
I used to sing.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.640
Well, in a quartet.

15:13.720 --> 15:17.440
I was no Corelli.

15:19.600 --> 15:23.640
I decided to do what I’m better at--
making money.

15:24.040 --> 15:29.040
I make money
and I help new talent get discovered.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.400
-Are you talking about the children now?
-Yes.

15:32.480 --> 15:36.040
For many years, I’ve been traveling
around the country listening to choirs.

15:36.120 --> 15:39.360
I look for talented children,
and I help them make it.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.880
Sometimes Tetyokhin helped me.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.000
-And that young man there?
-Five octaves.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.080
A unique range.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.160
What are they to you?

15:59.840 --> 16:00.680
Excuse me?

16:01.280 --> 16:03.760
Well, you’re their patron,
but what are they to you?

16:08.720 --> 16:13.400
-I do this--
-For the love of art. That’s clear.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.040
Nonetheless.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.720
Did you also help Mikhael?

16:19.120 --> 16:20.320
Ptakha?

16:25.680 --> 16:27.520
Ptakha, Ptakha, Ptakha.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.400
I found him…

16:32.560 --> 16:34.400
20 years ago

16:35.040 --> 16:39.560
in a dying town near Vladimir

16:40.320 --> 16:43.080
and made him who he is today.

16:45.840 --> 16:49.040
Was he the one who tipped you off?

16:49.640 --> 16:51.000
Tipped me off about what?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.960
Ptakha is a small-town boy

16:54.760 --> 16:57.720
who was elevated to great heights.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.040
He couldn’t handle it.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.880
The fame went to his head.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.760
He doesn’t understand.

17:05.839 --> 17:08.359
It could all change.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.440
Conversation over.

17:16.440 --> 17:19.240
Can I talk with Grisha?

17:19.319 --> 17:20.440
I’m afraid not.

17:20.520 --> 17:24.119
He has a voice lesson now,
and they aren’t finished.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.960
So much talent…
has passed through your hands.

17:31.520 --> 17:34.560
Are you in ancient Rome, comrade?

17:35.920 --> 17:37.920
Listen to me, you freak.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.160
If you make any waves…

17:42.320 --> 17:44.160
I’ll crush you…

17:45.360 --> 17:47.280
and feed you to the dogs.

17:48.640 --> 17:49.760
They’re great dogs.

17:50.600 --> 17:51.800
Great dogs. By the way.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.240
Like this…

18:00.120 --> 18:01.600
and checkmate.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.520
Why’d you unzip my jacket?

18:12.160 --> 18:13.960
It was immediately clear…

18:15.040 --> 18:16.680
he plays for the other team.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.280
Well… Yeah.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.120
What do you think of him?

18:22.240 --> 18:25.240
Did you see how big his house was?
The grounds and fences? It’s beautiful.
We should take a walk around.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.360
I’m sure
we’d find something to interest us.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.240
Yes, but who’d let us do that?

18:32.800 --> 18:35.400
He has protectors and associates
in high places.

18:36.160 --> 18:39.400
So getting in without a warrant,
without any consequences, is unlikely.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.920
-We need to break in.
-What are our options?

18:45.560 --> 18:47.040
Use my father?

18:47.920 --> 18:52.400
Your father and I, by the way, have had
a disagreement over you, to say the least.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.280
I don’t think he’ll do it.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.640
Yeah, I didn’t really want his help.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.560
I talked to your father.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.280
Shtikh has everything covered.

19:12.280 --> 19:14.320
No one is going to give you
a search warrant.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.080
What is he, untouchable?

19:17.720 --> 19:19.920
There aren’t any untouchables
in our country.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.200
Almost none. Yeah, and then…

19:25.200 --> 19:27.640
You know, you have to take him down
with hard evidence.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.600
If none exists and you don’t have any…

19:29.680 --> 19:31.360
But what if we have a witness?

19:32.800 --> 19:33.800
A witness.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.080
If there’s a witness…

19:38.440 --> 19:39.840
I’ll talk to your father again.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.080
Can I have the check, please?

19:59.240 --> 20:00.400
Listen.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.640
You wouldn’t want to…

20:06.560 --> 20:08.000
forget all of that?

20:08.080 --> 20:09.200
What do you mean?

20:10.360 --> 20:13.560
Everything that you saw… last time.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.120
I want to, but I know I can’t.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.600
You know…

20:24.600 --> 20:27.440
Ostriches are happy--

20:30.480 --> 20:32.080
people who simply go on with their lives.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.760
Waiting for the vacations…

20:36.280 --> 20:38.480
watching <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>
with Leonid Yakubovich.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.800
Who are we trying to protect?

20:46.400 --> 20:47.800
And from whom?

20:48.840 --> 20:50.080
Have you thought of that?

20:50.160 --> 20:51.360
I’ve thought of it.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.920
We’re protecting people from monsters.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.120
Find some evidence or a witness.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.680
Sorry for the disguise.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.960
-Fans.
-The burden of fame.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.840
I understand.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.920
By the way, it turns out
Shtikh is also an ardent fan of yours.

21:31.960 --> 21:33.360
That means you went to see him.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.200
Well, what did he tell you?

21:37.920 --> 21:39.320
That you hit the big time.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.840
On his wall, he has a photo of you…

21:45.960 --> 21:48.000
from 20 years ago.

21:49.320 --> 21:50.760
You know everything inside and out.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.120
Can you tell us?

21:56.600 --> 21:59.040
Are you prepared to see it through
to the end?

21:59.680 --> 22:00.480
Which is?

22:03.480 --> 22:04.760
Well…

22:06.000 --> 22:08.040
if you have money,
then anything is possible.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.640
Laws are for poor people.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.240
Shtikh has money and connections…

22:15.440 --> 22:17.120
and he’s gone completely crazy.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.520
So I’m asking,
are you prepared to go all the way?

22:19.600 --> 22:20.880
Are you?

22:23.160 --> 22:24.040
I’m ready.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.000
Then I’ll tell you this--

22:31.520 --> 22:33.040
he’s not the only one…

22:34.040 --> 22:35.520
who’s gone completely crazy.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.280
Listen, maybe…

22:46.280 --> 22:48.880
we can actually order something to drink.

22:57.320 --> 22:58.720
I’m from an orphanage.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
I grew up there.

23:03.080 --> 23:04.680
All the guys who didn’t die

23:04.760 --> 23:08.240
either started shooting up,
drinking, or are in prison.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.160
I’m the only one who escaped.

23:13.720 --> 23:17.760
A patron from Moscow, Shtikh,
came to visit us.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.160
<i>I knew that…</i>

23:23.600 --> 23:26.880
<i>he took the boys he liked back to Moscow.</i>

23:28.560 --> 23:29.840
<i>And I…</i>

23:32.440 --> 23:35.280
<i>really… made an effort.</i>

24:27.600 --> 24:29.960
<i>But he came to me within a week.</i>

24:31.080 --> 24:32.360
<i>At night.</i>

24:34.320 --> 24:37.360
<i>He explained</i>
<i>how everything was going to be.</i>

24:39.520 --> 24:43.600
<i>He said that, if I was a good boy,</i>
<i>I could have anything.</i>

24:44.280 --> 24:47.080
<i>But if I tried to run or said anything,</i>
<i>then I’d…</i>

24:48.080 --> 24:50.920
<i>be ripped apart</i>
<i>by the dogs in the driveway.</i>

25:04.520 --> 25:06.160
And…

25:07.760 --> 25:09.760
as strange as it sounds…

25:14.160 --> 25:15.360
I got used to it.

25:17.480 --> 25:18.880
I simply endured it.

25:22.840 --> 25:26.120
Then why, in your opinion,
is he making people disappear?

25:30.920 --> 25:32.160
How can I explain?

25:32.240 --> 25:36.080
They were all his acquaintances.
They were even close.

25:37.280 --> 25:41.560
I think that they knew-- or guessed,
at least-- about his pathology.

25:41.640 --> 25:46.240
Well, and now you see they’re electing
a new chairman of the board.

25:46.640 --> 25:50.960
It’s a prestigious position and well paid,
at the end of the day.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.480
Maybe they were squabbling over it.

25:54.320 --> 26:00.760
Shtikh’s methods are not so elegant,
in spite of his outward appearance.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.800
Could we have an hour of your time
tomorrow?

26:04.400 --> 26:05.920
To file an official statement.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.960
All right. Let’s do it.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.280
Tomorrow after the premiere.

26:34.040 --> 26:37.160
<i>I’m afraid I can’t help you.</i>

26:38.200 --> 26:39.840
<i>I’d really like to…</i>

26:41.440 --> 26:43.400
but that never happened.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.320
So Ptakha made everything up?

26:46.320 --> 26:47.640
Possibly.

26:48.560 --> 26:52.720
Maybe he wants to have a more tragic past.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.160
Did you love your husband?

26:57.160 --> 26:58.160
No.

26:59.640 --> 27:01.240
I was a beard.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.120
I pretended to be his wife.

27:09.400 --> 27:13.360
He didn’t like to advertise
his true inclination.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.560
What’d he give you?

27:17.640 --> 27:20.160
An apartment, car, the store-- everything?

27:21.480 --> 27:23.760
Yeah, we had an agreement.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.920
Everyone got what they wanted.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.480
Ptakha too.

27:32.760 --> 27:35.440
Have you read how much he’s making now?

27:35.960 --> 27:39.360
Shtikh is getting rid of anyone
who can tell the truth.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.840
Do you think that you’re safe?

27:43.880 --> 27:45.280
Excuse me, please.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.560
I can’t tell you anything.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.760
-I need to…
-Shoot up?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.920
I think you were both victims…

27:57.720 --> 27:59.200
cell mates.

27:59.280 --> 28:02.160
Only you had the easy duties.
Shtikh liked to play.

28:02.760 --> 28:03.960
Like this.

28:06.320 --> 28:10.400
Shooting up, snorting--
you could manage that.

28:11.720 --> 28:12.960
That’s probably…

28:14.160 --> 28:15.760
what you actually got.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.160
Let’s go.

28:29.240 --> 28:32.760
Five years ago, six people went missing
under similar circumstances.

28:32.840 --> 28:35.640
Four members of the board--
plus their wives--

28:36.040 --> 28:38.320
one music critic,
and a tenor from Bolshoi Theatre.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.120
Why weren’t the cases tied together?

28:41.200 --> 28:43.720
That’s a question
for our valiant police force.

28:44.840 --> 28:46.040
That’s it. I’m ready.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.720
What time is the premiere?

28:55.200 --> 28:56.200
Seven.

28:58.680 --> 28:59.760
It’s time to go.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.080
-Are you going like that?
-Yes.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.440
Are you sure? I got your suit ready.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.600
You also need to change clothes.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.240
-Why?
-It’ll be hard to run.

29:30.360 --> 29:31.560
I knew it!

29:31.640 --> 29:34.640
You decided to break into Shtikh’s house
during the premiere.

29:35.520 --> 29:38.440
Genius! We can’t live without surprises!

29:56.080 --> 29:59.080
How are we going to get inside?
We’re on camera.

30:01.960 --> 30:02.960
Let him record us.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.560
If we find what we need…

30:07.080 --> 30:11.240
then he’ll be praying
that no one knew we were here.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.160
Don’t breathe!

30:23.520 --> 30:24.520
Get in the car!

31:08.440 --> 31:09.720
I’m listening.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.920
<i>I convinced myself for a long time,</i>

31:12.520 --> 31:14.840
but you’re right, I’m guilty too.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.920
<i>We had an agreement with Gena.</i>

31:19.400 --> 31:22.680
Everything that happens in that house
stays in that house.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.520
Of course I could’ve freed Ptakha…

31:29.040 --> 31:30.960
but what would’ve happened to me?

31:31.680 --> 31:33.400
Did Shtikh rape him?

31:33.480 --> 31:34.800
<i>Yeah, and not just Shtikh.</i>

31:35.480 --> 31:36.880
Who else was there?

31:36.960 --> 31:38.560
Igor Sysoev…

31:39.720 --> 31:41.120
Misha Tetyokhin,

31:41.840 --> 31:43.040
Avdeyev… Latsis.

31:45.640 --> 31:46.840
<i>Grishin, Belyaev?</i>

31:54.840 --> 31:56.320
You already know.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.640
Now do you understand what happened?

32:40.560 --> 32:43.800
He was silent about the others
so we’d think it was Shtikh.

32:44.320 --> 32:47.160
All of these board members…

32:49.920 --> 32:51.680
Nonsense!

32:56.520 --> 32:58.120
He’s killing them… because he’s getting revenge.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.320
He’s getting revenge on them all.

33:10.440 --> 33:11.640
It’s him.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.160
It’s Ptakha.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.400
That’s it.

34:43.520 --> 34:46.080
You know, I’m embarrassed to ask, but…

34:47.960 --> 34:49.679
is anyone else coming?

34:50.159 --> 34:53.760
Or is it just you… and us? No one else?

34:54.920 --> 34:56.320
Do you need someone else?

35:00.000 --> 35:04.240
You know, it was a little strange
that you asked us over.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.440
Kind of unexpected.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.400
-Is something not to your liking?
-No.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.640
Everything is really great, actually.

35:15.120 --> 35:18.600
You have an immaculate home.
Only it’s a little out of the way.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.400
I specifically chose a house
with no neighbors.

35:22.840 --> 35:23.640
I sing.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.440
I didn’t want to impose on anyone.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.440
Isn’t it scary? Or do you have security?

35:32.320 --> 35:36.160
You saw my security.
I let them roam at night.

35:43.560 --> 35:44.560
Like Shtikh did.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.600
You remember.

35:54.560 --> 35:55.760
And we…

35:56.760 --> 35:59.400
Don’t be scared. They’ll like you.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.160
Who?

36:07.960 --> 36:12.400
Interesting. Is that thing for protection,
or are you a hunting enthusiast?

36:15.160 --> 36:16.840
I’m a weapons enthusiast.

36:19.200 --> 36:22.160
It’s… a Phantom.

36:23.840 --> 36:27.960
It’s the best hunting crossbow
in the world.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.600
At close range…

36:36.040 --> 36:41.000
there’s not a chance
the victim will survive.

36:43.160 --> 36:43.960
Mikhael.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.960
I’ve wanted to talk to you
for a long time.

36:47.720 --> 36:50.960
About your past… with Shtikh,

36:51.560 --> 36:53.200
but I never had the chance.

36:54.040 --> 36:55.240
Even after that, I--

36:55.960 --> 36:57.720
I didn’t realize it then.

36:59.440 --> 37:02.520
After that, I stopped speaking to Shtikh.

37:04.640 --> 37:05.440
Forgive me.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.040
God forgives.

37:21.880 --> 37:24.920
You knew everything.
You knew everything, you bitch.

39:15.640 --> 39:18.480
The victims’ cars were driven to the city,
the keys left inside.

39:18.560 --> 39:21.720
Near the first metro station,
but they didn’t stay there long.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.000
Any bodies?

39:23.760 --> 39:27.000
Dogs were found behind the house.
He poisoned them when he left.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.960
That means the bones are here.

39:30.560 --> 39:32.560
POLICE

39:38.520 --> 39:39.920
Dig here.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.800
Get a shovel and dig!

40:10.400 --> 40:12.320
Palych, why are you so happy?

40:12.400 --> 40:14.400
There’s a pile of bones, and he’s smiling.

40:14.840 --> 40:17.680
I’m writing an article
on dental identification.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.840
I didn’t have enough material.

40:20.920 --> 40:22.120
Now I’m good.

40:22.680 --> 40:25.520
Well, I’m happy
we helped you with your article.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.320
The plan to intercept him didn’t work.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.440
We didn’t find the car.
He made it out of the perimeter.

40:32.520 --> 40:35.240
-On the other hand, there’s a lead.
-What lead?

40:35.320 --> 40:38.640
Ptakha’s girlfriend, Anna.
She came to clear up their relationship.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.360
Of course, I knew he wasn’t normal.

40:44.440 --> 40:46.000
But for this to happen…

40:46.600 --> 40:47.720
Why’d you come?

40:49.480 --> 40:51.640
I was tired of him
not paying attention to me.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.480
He was constantly busy.

40:54.560 --> 40:55.960
It was just a farce.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.760
I saw him on stage
and fell in love immediately.

41:00.200 --> 41:03.520
After the premiere that evening,
I came back to see him.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.520
The conversation was nice, but at night…

41:06.600 --> 41:08.520
Honestly, he’s not really a man.

41:09.160 --> 41:11.120
Childhood trauma or something.

41:11.200 --> 41:14.200
It was either fast or not at all,
and he’d cry the whole time.

41:15.360 --> 41:17.320
I forgave him for everything.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.800
Honestly, we rarely saw each other.

41:23.560 --> 41:27.000
Performances, tours, interviews--
he was always busy.

41:27.080 --> 41:29.360
Recently, I stopped seeing him altogether.

41:29.440 --> 41:31.160
He couldn’t get away from the orphanage.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.720
Which orphanage? The one he grew up in.

41:40.920 --> 41:43.040
There was this gifted young boy there.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.840
Mikhael said that he sings like a god.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.960
He went there often
to practice singing with him.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.200
They went on walks, to cafés…

41:53.440 --> 41:55.440
He even brought him to Moscow. Look, I found it in his office.

42:01.880 --> 42:02.880
Let’s go!

43:48.760 --> 43:52.640
TWO DAYS EARLIER

44:21.400 --> 44:22.600
If you please!

44:24.840 --> 44:26.720
What am I guilty of, Meglin?

44:26.800 --> 44:30.040
All of these so-called decent people
have two faces!

44:30.840 --> 44:32.120
“Had.”

44:32.200 --> 44:35.800
And the more decent they seemed,
the more disgusting their inner beast.

44:35.880 --> 44:37.720
They were rotten inside, every one.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.400
I just finished them off!

44:40.840 --> 44:43.440
They decided that if you have money,
you can do anything.

44:44.240 --> 44:46.960
And when they showed up in your life,
you decided on this.

44:48.480 --> 44:51.160
No. That’s not it at all.

44:52.960 --> 44:56.480
Everyone has to answer for their actions.
You understand? For every action!

44:57.440 --> 44:58.920
Are you ready to answer for yours?

45:01.840 --> 45:02.640
I’m ready.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.120
Just give me two days, Meglin.

45:07.720 --> 45:10.520
Do you want to save the boy,
or do you want to get revenge?

45:15.040 --> 45:16.240
Give him two days.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.160
Two days. Mikhael!

46:23.400 --> 46:25.800
Did you decide to have your cake
and eat it too?

46:25.880 --> 46:28.600
Kill Shtikh and get away quietly?

46:29.080 --> 46:30.840
Someone needs to take care of the boy.

46:31.440 --> 46:34.240
-He’s a genius. He’ll be lost without me.
-He’ll manage.

46:35.080 --> 46:36.480
Give me three minutes.

46:37.720 --> 46:40.280
I already gave you two days.

46:41.240 --> 46:42.840
I want to say good-bye to Egor.

46:47.320 --> 46:48.320
Go.

47:10.600 --> 47:12.200
Why’d you let him go?

47:17.560 --> 47:18.960
Put your gun away.

48:31.160 --> 48:33.480
Well, all right, Meglin…

48:34.560 --> 48:37.240
to put it mildly,
was absolutely not normal.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.760
But you?

48:38.840 --> 48:40.840
You could’ve prevented all of this.

48:40.920 --> 48:44.200
What, were you afraid?
You didn’t want to take a risk?

48:44.280 --> 48:48.000
You could’ve turned to your father--
Steklov, Senior Adviser.

48:52.240 --> 48:53.360
What?

48:56.600 --> 48:59.000
That would’ve been insubordination.

49:07.680 --> 49:12.840
MOSCOW
