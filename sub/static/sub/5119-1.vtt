00:52.760 --> 00:54.957
Good morning, Connor.
Versace is on 1.

00:55.131 --> 00:56.564
Okay.

00:56.732 --> 01:00.432
- Clear out.
- Good, good, good. Oh, I like this.

01:01.407 --> 01:03.706
Okay, ladies,
do not look at me or the camera.

01:03.877 --> 01:08.442
Just keep doing what you do.
On three. One, two, three.

01:08.618 --> 01:11.953
All right. Reset, I'll be right back.
Pull the backlight down, and stop.

01:12.123 --> 01:14.252
And more martinis around.
Nice work, gentlemen.

01:14.428 --> 01:17.024
Connor wants a re-light on one.
We're moving to Stage 2.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.293
And the <i>Vanity Fair</i> cover
is waiting on two.

01:19.469 --> 01:22.168
- Oh, hey, you.
- Hi, Mr. Mead.

01:22.342 --> 01:24.003
Hey. Good morning, ladies.

01:24.177 --> 01:26.271
So do you wanna have dinner
with us after?

01:26.447 --> 01:28.007
I'd love to, but I can't.

01:28.184 --> 01:30.653
I'm booked solid, ladies.
But I will find you, okay?

01:30.821 --> 01:32.483
Okay.

01:32.958 --> 01:34.289
You want me to book them?

01:34.460 --> 01:35.792
- Yes.
- Bye.

01:35.962 --> 01:39.332
- Separately or together?
- Yes. Ha, ha.

01:42.173 --> 01:44.233
- Good morning, Kalia.
- Hello.

01:44.410 --> 01:45.502
I'm Connor Mead.

01:45.678 --> 01:47.647
- You're ravishing.
- Well, thank you.

01:47.814 --> 01:49.750
Stand here, please.

01:50.052 --> 01:52.112
All right.

01:52.289 --> 01:55.021
Let's get started.
Get rid of the green screen.

01:55.193 --> 01:57.094
- Um, let's cozy up. Give me key light.
- Wha...?

01:57.263 --> 02:00.497
- Bring it over and down six inches.
- Excuse me, what are you doing?

02:00.670 --> 02:05.167
And keep the set medic on cue just in case.
Can I have the, um...?

02:05.344 --> 02:06.369
Apples.

02:06.546 --> 02:11.110
- This is my wardrobe.
- That's the one. Oh, an ode to Billy Tell.

02:11.286 --> 02:14.279
I just wanna let you know
that I'm a huge fan.

02:14.458 --> 02:18.362
Likewise. I mean, I'm not 12 years old
and tone-deaf, so I don't like your music...

02:18.531 --> 02:20.797
...but I really dig your look.

02:20.969 --> 02:23.632
Can we come here and strengthen up
these eyebrows a touch?

02:23.806 --> 02:28.941
- Stay right there. Stay right there.
- So this is it?

02:29.115 --> 02:30.947
This is the picture?

02:31.485 --> 02:35.321
- I'm half naked with an apple on my head.
- Yes, you are.

02:35.491 --> 02:38.554
This is the cover of <i>Vanity Fair</i>
from the great Connor Mead?

02:38.731 --> 02:40.289
Well, not quite.

02:40.466 --> 02:44.270
I'd like to introduce you to Kako Tatsumi.
She's a Japanese archery champion.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.101
She's gonna be helping us out today.

02:46.610 --> 02:49.479
And you have nothing to fear.
She placed sixth in Beijing.

02:52.252 --> 02:54.050
Are you joking?

02:54.222 --> 02:55.451
Is he...? Is he joking?

02:56.158 --> 02:58.822
Kalia, chin down, eyes here,
arms to your side.

03:00.298 --> 03:03.201
- Somebody tell me he's joking.
- Don't move.

03:03.370 --> 03:04.668
Kako, on my count.

03:08.278 --> 03:09.610
She didn't even medal!

03:14.821 --> 03:17.087
Just listen to my music.

03:19.328 --> 03:21.730
I am more than my look. I am.

03:21.900 --> 03:24.301
Sweetie, you are already gorgeous.

03:24.470 --> 03:27.237
Why do you need
to be good at two things, huh?

03:27.409 --> 03:28.933
Connor.

03:29.111 --> 03:31.638
- Need your select on the mayor's proofs.
- Now?

03:31.817 --> 03:33.718
And I'm juggling three of your buddies...

03:33.886 --> 03:35.821
...on iChat.
- Does she knock?

03:35.989 --> 03:39.222
Sorry. You told me to make sure
you were on the road by 2.

03:39.395 --> 03:40.555
Why?

03:40.729 --> 03:42.391
Your brother's wedding in Newport?

03:42.567 --> 03:44.799
- That's today?
- The rehearsal dinner's tonight...

03:44.971 --> 03:48.032
...at your Uncle Wayne's old estate.
- Oh, God, I gotta get up there.

03:48.209 --> 03:53.013
And I have Kiki, Charlece and Nadja
on your IM. They keep calling.

03:53.184 --> 03:56.382
- Nadja. Remind me who Nadja is again?
- Nadja was dinner Friday night.

03:56.555 --> 04:01.724
- Right. Very pretty girl. Didn't say much.
- She's Romanian. Barely speaks English.

04:01.897 --> 04:04.459
Well, that explains it.
Scan these to Mike right away.

04:04.635 --> 04:08.232
I am a touch busy, if you could
take care of those calls, I'd appreciate it.

04:08.407 --> 04:11.504
No. No way. I'm not breaking up with girls
for you, Connor.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.945
That's where I draw the line.
I believe in karma.

04:14.117 --> 04:15.551
Okay.

04:15.954 --> 04:17.786
- Conference them.
- Conference them?

04:17.957 --> 04:20.322
- Conference them.
- Oh, no, you wouldn't.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.360
Oh, yes, I would.

04:23.798 --> 04:25.927
They're conferenced.
Click here to disconnect.

04:26.436 --> 04:29.135
- Hello, ladies, it's Connor Mead.
- <i>Hi, Connor.</i>

04:29.308 --> 04:32.245
- <i>Hi.</i>
- <i>Whoa, is there anyone else on the line?</i>

04:32.414 --> 04:35.873
Listen, I'm sincerely pressed for time
right now, so I'm gonna...

04:36.053 --> 04:38.717
Well, I'm gonna have to do this in bulk.
Um...

04:39.492 --> 04:41.324
It's not gonna work out for us.

04:41.495 --> 04:43.087
- <i>Wait, are you kidding me?</i>
- <i>What?</i>

04:43.264 --> 04:46.029
<i>Tell me you're not breaking up</i>
<i>with me on a conference call.</i>

04:46.202 --> 04:49.174
- <i>But I thought things were going great.</i>
- <i>You are a womans hater.</i>

04:49.341 --> 04:50.673
<i>Connor Mead hates womans.</i>

04:50.843 --> 04:54.645
No, no, no, I love womans.
I mean, "women," all right?

04:54.816 --> 04:56.842
I love all women.
That's the problem here.

04:57.019 --> 05:00.890
<i>No. The problem is you date a girl for</i>
<i>two weeks, get her to fall in love with you</i>...

05:01.061 --> 05:05.624
<i>He takes the love and he hoard it,</i>
<i>like a miser.</i>

05:05.801 --> 05:08.999
Jesus, doesn't anyone
just wanna have fun anymore?

05:09.172 --> 05:10.197
I like to have fun.

05:10.374 --> 05:13.539
All right, then don't listen to these ladies.
They are crazy.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.377
<i>We can still hear you</i>
<i>when you cover the camera, you know.</i>

05:16.552 --> 05:18.487
- Right.
- <i>Emotionally retarded.</i>

05:18.654 --> 05:20.556
- <i>You really need therapy.</i>
- <i>You stupid boy.</i>

05:20.725 --> 05:23.629
Ladies, it sounds like you have
an awful lot to discuss, okay?

05:23.797 --> 05:27.359
So I'm gonna jump off,
but feel free to keep talking, okay?

05:27.535 --> 05:33.500
Kiki, Nadja, Charlece, I had an amazing time
with each one of you.

05:33.679 --> 05:35.614
I wish you all the best.

05:35.782 --> 05:37.945
- Goodbye.
- <i>No, we are not done</i>...

05:38.120 --> 05:40.681
You really are as bad as they say.

05:40.857 --> 05:44.352
Oh, no, dear, I am just a little bit worse.

05:44.530 --> 05:46.897
Of course, you'd never treat me
that way, right?

05:47.067 --> 05:51.131
No. I just did that for you.
I'm cleaning my plate for the main course.

05:52.542 --> 05:56.140
You're the biggest jerk ever.
In fact, you're even famous for it.

05:57.050 --> 05:59.418
No, really, why am I doing this?

05:59.587 --> 06:02.523
Well, it usually has something to do
with your father.

06:02.692 --> 06:05.664
Oh, please.
I've never even met my father.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.225
Well, come to papa.

07:02.121 --> 07:05.354
Okay, here we go.

07:05.827 --> 07:10.494
This will have gone like clockwork,
so at 1529 I will say:

07:10.668 --> 07:12.160
"You may kiss the bride."

07:12.338 --> 07:14.203
Oh, we should practice that,
shouldn't we?

07:15.576 --> 07:17.978
- Oh, God.
- Paulie. Hey.

07:18.147 --> 07:20.673
- Connor. Go around.
- Yeah.

07:20.851 --> 07:22.376
He came.

07:23.924 --> 07:25.949
- He came.
- He came.

07:26.126 --> 07:27.185
- What's wrong?
- What?

07:27.361 --> 07:30.423
Well, you and all but one of my bridesmaids
have slept with him...

07:30.600 --> 07:33.127
...so he can't be that bad, right?
- No.

07:33.305 --> 07:35.570
- Jenny, soothe the nervous bride.
- Oh, it's fine.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.512
Hey.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.582
Connor.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.444
- Good to see you. Yeah.
- You made it.

07:43.621 --> 07:45.089
- You look great.
- Thank you, man.

07:45.257 --> 07:48.194
What do you think about what
we did to Uncle Wayne's old karate dojo?

07:48.362 --> 07:49.990
- Whoa.
- I'm psyched.

07:50.166 --> 07:52.134
I didn't think
you were gonna make the rehearsal.

07:52.301 --> 07:53.964
Well, I wanted to get here early...

07:54.138 --> 07:57.075
...make sure you had time
to think about our last conversation.

07:57.245 --> 08:00.578
You know, the one about marriage, love,
never-ending lifelong monogamy?

08:00.749 --> 08:02.377
Yes, I definitely thought about it.

08:02.552 --> 08:04.076
- You did? Good, good.
- Yes, I did.

08:04.254 --> 08:07.124
If you're having second thoughts,
here's the key to my Jag.

08:07.293 --> 08:09.990
You give me the word, I'll block.

08:10.498 --> 08:12.695
- Oh, my God, you're serious.
- You're damn right.

08:12.869 --> 08:15.668
Man, I'll do anything for you.
Who's got your back, huh?

08:15.840 --> 08:19.301
Hey, it's you and me
against the world, right?

08:19.479 --> 08:21.141
Why is he giving him keys?

08:21.315 --> 08:24.115
- Why's he giving him keys?
- Oh, I bet he's giving you a car.

08:24.287 --> 08:26.813
- I'm just gonna go check on that.
- Okay.

08:26.991 --> 08:30.759
Connor, we've talked about this.
I wanna get married. I love Sandra.

08:30.931 --> 08:33.366
- You say that now, okay?
- Everything okay here, guys?

08:33.534 --> 08:35.767
Because we're still,
you know, rehearsing.

08:35.938 --> 08:37.966
- Jenny Perotti.
- Connor Mead.

08:38.143 --> 08:41.114
- I'll be damned.
- That's probably true.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.149
- Hey, the bride's unsupervised.
- I'm on it.

08:44.319 --> 08:47.518
- Buddy, we're not done talking about this.
- Done talking about what?

08:48.359 --> 08:50.624
- Options.
- Options.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.958
Yeah, listen to me, Connor.

08:53.133 --> 08:57.232
This is the biggest weekend in Sandy's life.
If you detract from her wedding...

08:57.407 --> 09:01.004
...I will sneak into your room
and cut off your favorite appendage.

09:01.180 --> 09:02.911
Now, the first part sounds nice.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.518
I can make it look like an accident.
Don't push me.

09:05.686 --> 09:09.853
Just try to be supportive. Normal.
Just not a train wreck for once.

09:10.027 --> 09:12.259
- I'll be on my best behavior.
- That worries me.

09:12.431 --> 09:14.422
I will, I'll be supportive. Whatever.

09:14.601 --> 09:15.967
- Really?
- Yes.

09:16.137 --> 09:17.366
Come on.

09:17.539 --> 09:20.304
See? I knew there wouldn't be
any weirdness between you two.

09:20.477 --> 09:24.645
- Connor, you remember Sandra?
- Yes, I do. How are you, Sandra?

09:25.486 --> 09:28.047
You know, it's not too late
to get out, gorgeous.

09:28.223 --> 09:29.486
He's joking.

09:29.659 --> 09:31.457
And you know the bridesmaids.

09:31.628 --> 09:34.998
Oh, yes, I do. Deena, Donna.
How are you?

09:35.168 --> 09:36.328
- And, uh...?
- Denice.

09:36.503 --> 09:39.065
- Nice to meet you, Denice. Ladies.
- Me too. How are you?

09:39.241 --> 09:42.076
My groomsmen.
Guys, this is my brother, Connor.

09:42.279 --> 09:44.248
- We've heard the stories, man.
- Oh, okay.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.478
- An honor to be serving with you.
- And with you.

09:47.653 --> 09:50.284
It's "mice" to "neet" you.
Damn it, I blew it.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.552
Sorry to break up the bromance,
guys, but...

09:52.729 --> 09:55.359
...I need you right here
where I can keep my eyes on you.

09:55.534 --> 09:58.060
- Absolutely.
- Are we ready?

09:58.237 --> 09:59.330
Yes, sorry, sarge.

09:59.841 --> 10:02.037
Sarge?
Are they getting married by a cop?

10:02.212 --> 10:05.410
Sergeant Major Volcom,
United States Marine Corps.

10:05.583 --> 10:08.384
I am not a cop.

10:09.856 --> 10:13.693
- Where'd you find this ray of sunshine?
- He's Sandra's dad.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.959
Sarge, this is my brother, Connor.
Connor, this is the sarge.

10:17.135 --> 10:19.128
He was ordained right after the war.

10:19.306 --> 10:22.675
Little war called Korea.
Perhaps you've heard of it, slick?

10:22.845 --> 10:24.677
Lost more men than Nam.

10:24.849 --> 10:27.216
We didn't get a wall.
We didn't get a movie.

10:27.385 --> 10:30.846
We got a sitcom with Alan Alda
which was all nonstop laughs...

10:31.024 --> 10:33.425
...unless you were the one
watching his friends die.

10:33.595 --> 10:36.122
The war's over, Dad. It was a tie.

10:36.299 --> 10:39.168
You know, we should probably try
to keep going on schedule.

10:39.338 --> 10:41.706
- Hua.
- Hua.

10:41.875 --> 10:45.939
Following the kiss at 1530 hours,
on my mark...

10:46.115 --> 10:48.084
...groom will take bride's left forearm...

10:48.252 --> 10:52.317
...rotate 180 degrees,
orienting north by northwest.

10:52.493 --> 10:55.360
Then I will announce you
as husband and wife.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.523
Following which...

10:59.302 --> 11:03.367
Following which,
you will live happily ever after.

11:05.547 --> 11:06.572
Oh, Daddy.

11:07.249 --> 11:09.582
- So sweet. Oh, my God.
- That is sweet.

11:10.721 --> 11:13.419
- I'm surrounded by huggers.
- There we go.

11:13.594 --> 11:16.529
- No, we're cool, man.
- Come on.

11:27.849 --> 11:31.287
Hey, Uncle Wayne.

11:34.260 --> 11:38.288
Ah, the world's a lot less fun
without you in it, buddy.

11:43.073 --> 11:45.407
Oh, no. Oh, no.

11:45.577 --> 11:49.071
No decorations in here. No.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.744
No. No.

11:51.922 --> 11:54.153
And, yes.

11:54.325 --> 11:55.350
No.

11:56.796 --> 12:01.166
- No! Wha...? What did...? What the...?
- Something wrong?

12:03.641 --> 12:06.133
I got over 30 scented candles
in my room.

12:06.311 --> 12:09.043
- Oh, the wedding scent is lavender.
- The wedding scent?

12:09.216 --> 12:12.153
- And people wonder why I'm not married.
- Not really.

12:12.321 --> 12:16.020
I mean, seriously, Jenny, my Uncle Wayne
is rolling over in his grave right now.

12:16.193 --> 12:18.163
No, come on. Wayne loved a good party.

12:18.331 --> 12:22.393
Party, yes. A wedding? No.
Back in the day that man used this place...

12:22.569 --> 12:27.100
...for mind-numbing, clothing-optional,
weeklong orgies, okay?

12:27.277 --> 12:29.577
Do you know Dean Martin
slept in that bathroom?

12:29.748 --> 12:32.878
He drank from the bidet
and sang the Canadian national anthem...

12:33.054 --> 12:34.352
...in Spanish.
- In Spanish.

12:34.523 --> 12:40.124
- Yeah, I remember Wayne telling us that.
- Yeah. Now that, that was a party. Not this.

12:42.103 --> 12:45.403
You know, people were taking bets
on whether or not you'd even show up.

12:45.574 --> 12:47.975
- Miss my kid brother's wedding?
- That's what I said.

12:48.144 --> 12:51.605
The whole asshole thing you do
is to get insecure women to sleep with you.

12:51.784 --> 12:55.620
- Deep down, you're a big sweetheart.
- Oh. Look who's got me pegged.

12:55.790 --> 12:59.593
And there's the sarcasm to cover up
the accidental display of affection for Paul.

12:59.764 --> 13:01.232
Hey.

13:02.068 --> 13:03.593
I'm not covering anything up.

13:04.337 --> 13:09.506
And I would also be more than happy to
take off the rest of my clothes to prove it.

13:09.680 --> 13:13.915
Then there's the cheap sexual innuendo.
All the old Connor Mead tricks are back.

13:14.087 --> 13:17.251
Well, don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

13:17.426 --> 13:20.420
I won't tell anyone you have feelings.

13:22.634 --> 13:23.268
Hua!

13:23.268 --> 13:25.204
Hua!

13:27.641 --> 13:28.836
Oh, gosh.

13:29.010 --> 13:33.347
- Okay. Yeah, it didn't work. Still nervous.
- Let's do another one.

13:33.518 --> 13:36.922
- Sandy, what about him?
- Dan Palumbo. Married.

13:37.091 --> 13:38.490
Oh. Kids?

13:38.659 --> 13:40.959
What? They're not really married
unless they have kids.

13:41.130 --> 13:42.359
Hua.

13:42.534 --> 13:45.402
- Heard, understood, acknowledged.
- Sandy.

13:46.506 --> 13:48.497
Save some liquor
for the rest of the guests.

13:48.675 --> 13:50.736
- Bye, Mrs. Mead.
- Clean my room, pledge.

13:56.121 --> 13:58.591
Slow down. Slow down.

13:59.326 --> 14:00.487
- Hey.
- Here you are, sir.

14:00.662 --> 14:03.758
If you can keep those coming
all night. Thank you.

14:03.935 --> 14:05.835
And now we're off.

14:06.003 --> 14:07.369
- Excuse me, Mr. Mead?
- Mm-hm.

14:07.540 --> 14:09.873
I just wanna tell you,
I'm a huge fan of your work.

14:10.043 --> 14:12.775
- Thank you.
- Gonna photograph your brother's wedding?

14:13.248 --> 14:16.242
No. No, I'm not a wedding photographer.

14:16.420 --> 14:19.586
- Right, but it's your brother.
- Right.

14:19.759 --> 14:23.458
He's not good at taking pictures of people
with their clothes on.

14:23.632 --> 14:25.795
- Look who's funny.
- It's not his specialty.

14:27.171 --> 14:29.073
- Ah.
- Turn your phone off.

14:29.642 --> 14:30.940
Connor Mead.

14:31.411 --> 14:33.208
No, I would not like to cut my quota.

14:33.380 --> 14:35.680
- Connor.
- Look, just tell him to go screw himself.

14:35.851 --> 14:38.378
- Yeah, I said, tell him to go screw himself.
- Hey.

14:38.856 --> 14:41.850
Like when a man and a woman...
I gotta go. Gotta go.

14:42.029 --> 14:43.894
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

14:44.064 --> 14:46.091
- Sit down before you...
- Oh, my God.

14:46.269 --> 14:47.932
- What?
- What is this?

14:48.106 --> 14:52.238
- Endive arugula salad. You did well...
- No, no, no. The salad I ordered had figs.

14:52.412 --> 14:56.316
Yeah, because fruit is the new crouton.
This is...

14:57.352 --> 15:01.257
This is a disaster. My friends and family
didn't come all the way over here...

15:01.426 --> 15:04.192
...to be met with some lackluster salad.
Where are the figs?

15:04.364 --> 15:06.926
Excuse me, where are the figs?
Because I want some figs!

15:07.102 --> 15:09.037
Sweetie? Sweetie. Hi.

15:09.206 --> 15:10.538
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

15:10.708 --> 15:12.176
Hi.

15:12.344 --> 15:14.906
Okay, look, you're right, okay?
You did order figs.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.143
But, uh, everyone seems
to be loving the salad, right?

15:18.320 --> 15:20.813
- Anybody missing figs?
- The dressing is a panoply...

15:20.991 --> 15:23.358
...of flavors.
- It's really good salad.

15:24.697 --> 15:27.030
- A lot to recommend, this salad.
- Okay. Sorry.

15:27.201 --> 15:30.730
- There she is. All right, she's back.
- I'm sorry, everyone. I just...

15:30.908 --> 15:34.607
It's my wedding and...
Well, I'm not usually a massive bitch.

15:34.780 --> 15:37.147
- She kind of is.
- Ha, ha. Stop it.

15:37.317 --> 15:40.720
I just really want everything
to start out perfectly.

15:40.889 --> 15:43.825
I mean, I only plan on getting married
four or five times, tops.

15:43.995 --> 15:45.896
Oh, sweetie.

15:46.064 --> 15:47.658
Oh, which reminds me, Connor.

15:47.835 --> 15:50.703
Sandy and I wanted to know
if you would make a toast tomorrow.

15:50.872 --> 15:52.205
What?

15:52.976 --> 15:56.243
- Yeah. We'd like that.
- I know it's not really your thing...

15:56.415 --> 15:59.614
...but it is kind of a tradition
for the best man to give a toast.

15:59.786 --> 16:02.382
- Could be super short.
- Super long, whatever you want.

16:02.557 --> 16:05.084
- They kidding? Are you kidding?
- Yes.

16:05.262 --> 16:06.320
- No.
- Yes.

16:06.498 --> 16:10.403
No, you're the only family I got here,
so I thought you could say something.

16:10.571 --> 16:12.972
I don't think this is the best idea
you've ever had.

16:13.142 --> 16:15.442
- I'm with Jenny.
- You can scrounge up a cousin...

16:15.613 --> 16:17.445
No, no, no. Come on, you're my brother.

16:17.616 --> 16:19.813
You're funny, you're articulate,
you're smart.

16:19.987 --> 16:24.449
- True, true and true. Um, I'm flattered, but...
- lf you're not gonna take pictures...

16:24.627 --> 16:27.756
...it's the least you can do.
- Who the hell is this guy?

16:27.932 --> 16:29.127
- Who's that?
- Jeff.

16:29.301 --> 16:33.672
I'm not toasting anyone tomorrow, okay?

16:33.842 --> 16:37.440
I can't toast this.

16:37.615 --> 16:40.483
- Come on.
- This always happens. All Scotch, no carbs.

16:40.653 --> 16:43.987
Is there a bread basket? You know what,
let's talk about something else.

16:44.157 --> 16:45.682
So, um, when do you catch your flight?

16:45.861 --> 16:48.764
Paulie, you know where I come out
on all this, buddy.

16:48.933 --> 16:53.339
To me, marriage is an archaic
and oppressive institution...

16:53.507 --> 16:55.635
...that should a been abolished years ago.

16:55.810 --> 17:00.512
And love? It's magical comfort food
for the weak and the uneducated.

17:00.685 --> 17:02.882
Yeah, it makes you feel all warm
and relevant...

17:03.056 --> 17:07.290
...but in the end, love leaves you weak,
dependant and fat.

17:08.296 --> 17:11.461
- Yeah, that might not make the best toast.
- Are you saying I'm fat?

17:11.635 --> 17:13.502
- No. Are you kidding?
- No, no, no.

17:13.672 --> 17:16.040
No, sweetie, sweetie,
he's being funny, I think.

17:16.210 --> 17:19.339
Better hold your next words
real close, Paco.

17:19.516 --> 17:25.755
Believe me, all right? For Paul's sake,
I wish I could believe in all this crap. I do.

17:25.925 --> 17:28.394
And I also wish I could believe
in the Easter bunny...

17:28.561 --> 17:32.023
...the missile shield,
and strippers with a heart of gold, all right?

17:32.203 --> 17:36.767
But, unfortunately, I am condemned
to see the world as it really is.

17:36.944 --> 17:39.345
And love? Love is a myth.

17:39.514 --> 17:43.578
Oh, good. Because I was afraid you were
gonna make a really long, cynical speech.

17:44.389 --> 17:45.516
Truth hurts, baby.

17:46.025 --> 17:48.962
- Why don't you go?
- Yeah. Why don't I do that?

17:49.130 --> 17:51.098
And I think I'll take my salad with me.

17:52.702 --> 17:55.194
Mm. Some figs would've been nice.

18:04.755 --> 18:07.782
This is gonna be tougher than I thought.

18:10.397 --> 18:12.297
You got that right, kid.

18:15.405 --> 18:17.396
Uncle Wayne?

18:20.780 --> 18:22.612
Uncle Wayne.

18:22.783 --> 18:24.912
- Uh...
- Ha, ha.

18:25.088 --> 18:26.113
You're dead.

18:26.290 --> 18:30.923
Players never die, Dutch.
They just try their luck at a different table.

18:31.098 --> 18:32.759
Whoa, whoa.

18:32.934 --> 18:35.699
Never touch a man
when he's hanging a wire.

18:35.871 --> 18:37.499
You kidding me?

18:42.449 --> 18:43.473
Oh, God.

18:45.487 --> 18:47.719
Aqua Velva.

18:48.459 --> 18:51.793
What are you...? What are you...?
What are you...? What are you doing here?

18:51.965 --> 18:54.195
I'm here to warn you, kid.

18:54.368 --> 18:56.461
Don't waste your life like I did.

18:56.637 --> 19:00.508
What are you talking about?
You had a great life, man.

19:00.678 --> 19:04.208
You're a legend.
The money, the parties, the women, you...

19:04.384 --> 19:07.822
Listen, kid. When the music stops
and you're looking for your slacks...

19:07.990 --> 19:10.620
...none of that stuff matters worth a lick.

19:11.029 --> 19:14.431
Well, there was this one party. Um...

19:14.835 --> 19:16.564
New Year's '68, Philippines.

19:16.737 --> 19:19.537
Me, Stevie McQueen,
17 Lufthansa stewardesses...

19:19.709 --> 19:23.272
...and a pile of blow the size of a toaster.

19:23.448 --> 19:24.882
Now that was a good night.

19:25.050 --> 19:26.986
Aw. That sounds like a great night.

19:27.154 --> 19:30.648
Oh, no, I've had a few laughs,
I've chased some tail but, trust me, Dutch...

19:30.827 --> 19:32.421
...you don't wanna end up like me.

19:32.597 --> 19:35.465
- What are you talking about?
- No, no. Save it for the sandman.

19:35.635 --> 19:40.574
I've been watching you,
and you are definitely turning out like me.

19:40.743 --> 19:42.678
Frankly, I mean, who could blame you?

19:42.846 --> 19:46.808
But tonight...
Tonight, things are gonna change.

19:49.157 --> 19:52.059
Tonight you're gonna be visited
by three ghosts.

19:52.595 --> 19:54.565
You have got to be kidding me.

19:54.732 --> 19:59.262
And you're gonna be forced to feel things
that you haven't felt for a long time.

19:59.439 --> 20:02.068
Things like feelings, for example.

20:02.244 --> 20:06.808
Remember, no matter how much it hurts,
it's all for your own good.

20:06.985 --> 20:11.357
And the stuff that's not for your own good,
it's for my entertainment.

20:11.526 --> 20:13.722
Look, Uncle Wayne, you...

20:16.902 --> 20:18.494
Where'd he go?

20:25.681 --> 20:28.743
All right, that didn't just happen. Okay.

20:37.167 --> 20:38.635
Uh-oh.

20:40.539 --> 20:41.641
Melanie! Melanie? Where are you?
I need you up here, all right?

20:41.641 --> 20:44.042
Melanie! Melanie? Where are you?
I need you up here, all right?

20:44.212 --> 20:48.014
Look, you are my assistant
and I need assistance.

20:48.184 --> 20:51.280
Blue Label and give it wings, brother.
Call me.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.012
You feel so real.

21:10.187 --> 21:13.055
Well, they are, honey. A hundred percent.

21:13.224 --> 21:18.221
I'm not sure what you've heard about me,
but I usually like to be bought a drink first.

21:19.301 --> 21:24.071
- You're not who I thought you were.
- Vonda Volcom, mother of the bride.

21:25.144 --> 21:31.712
Connor Mead, brother of the groom.
Please, sit, Vonda Volcom.

21:31.888 --> 21:33.447
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

21:33.624 --> 21:37.027
- Champagne for the lady.
- Lovely.

21:37.197 --> 21:40.225
- So how long have you been divorced?
- I beg your pardon?

21:40.402 --> 21:42.395
Please. I mean, you're ravishing.

21:42.573 --> 21:45.134
No married woman your age
keeps her form this fine.

21:48.381 --> 21:51.442
I've been divorced eight years now.

21:51.887 --> 21:54.289
Sarge and I aren't talking just yet.

21:55.159 --> 21:58.289
- It's juvenile and sad.
- Honey, stop right there.

21:58.464 --> 22:00.127
It's not your fault, okay?

22:00.301 --> 22:04.433
Marriage is a corrupt
and hateful institution.

22:04.608 --> 22:07.545
I covered all of this earlier
at another table.

22:07.713 --> 22:11.515
I wanna ask you something.
When did casual sex become a crime?

22:12.887 --> 22:14.686
I mean,
nowadays being single means...

22:14.857 --> 22:17.487
...what, you've lost your way?
That something is missing?

22:18.162 --> 22:22.762
Never mind that every night
I swim in a lake of sex...

22:22.938 --> 22:26.842
...and they fall asleep
in each others' arms, spooning.

22:28.213 --> 22:31.706
Connor, spooning is nice.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.821
Yeah, but not as nice as forking.

22:34.989 --> 22:37.186
- Am I right?
- Ha, ha. It's true.

22:37.360 --> 22:40.296
Hey, you know what the owner of this place
once told me?

22:40.464 --> 22:44.336
He said, "Keep it light, Dutch.
Keep it light."

22:45.006 --> 22:48.171
I never understood
why he called me Dutch...

22:48.578 --> 22:52.847
...but I believe his wisdom still holds.
- That's nice.

22:53.019 --> 22:54.885
- I like that.
- Mm.

22:56.857 --> 23:01.025
Listen, darling, before we take this
to the next level, are we off-limits?

23:01.199 --> 23:03.600
I mean, technically we're not family
until tomorrow.

23:03.769 --> 23:06.741
I am extremely flattered.

23:06.909 --> 23:10.904
But, yes, we are definitely off-limits.

23:11.082 --> 23:14.884
That's a shame. I bet you know
your way around a bedroom.

23:15.055 --> 23:16.784
You always talk to women like this?

23:17.659 --> 23:18.921
Yes.

23:19.094 --> 23:21.496
- Does it work?
- Yes.

23:23.334 --> 23:28.469
Well, while I can't be of service to you,
I am sure that she can.

23:28.643 --> 23:33.083
Blonde, six o'clock?
Blue dress, legs up to her chin?

23:33.251 --> 23:37.245
That's the one. She's been eyeing you
the whole time we've been talking.

23:37.423 --> 23:40.519
- It's been a real pleasure talking to you.
- Likewise.

23:40.695 --> 23:43.495
You are truly an inspiration.

23:45.436 --> 23:48.465
Hi. Excuse me.
I'm gonna steal her away just for a second.

23:48.642 --> 23:51.578
Jenny, come with me.
I have to give you your maid-of-honor gift.

23:51.746 --> 23:53.943
Remember that guy
I was telling you about, Brad?

23:54.117 --> 23:56.609
No, no. I told you,
I do not want to be set up again.

23:56.789 --> 23:59.486
I've been through it too many times.
Please don't make me.

23:59.659 --> 24:01.686
That's Brad.

24:05.502 --> 24:06.970
Okay, but this is the last time.

24:07.138 --> 24:09.904
- How are my teeth?
- Clear. Perfect.

24:10.777 --> 24:13.771
- Just try to play it cool. Just no big deal.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

24:13.949 --> 24:16.579
Brad. This is Jenny.

24:16.754 --> 24:19.452
- Right. The hot, single doctor.
- Hi.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.650
Paul and Sandra
have been talking about you.

24:21.829 --> 24:25.824
I know what car you drive, where you
went to school, how many dogs you have.

24:26.001 --> 24:29.700
That is right. You're both animal people.
What are the odds?

24:29.874 --> 24:31.901
- So glad this isn't awkward.
- Right. Ahem.

24:32.078 --> 24:37.418
Oh, I forgot to tell you. Brad loves
to run triathlons too. I know, right?

24:37.588 --> 24:41.583
- Do you wanna go anywhere else?
- Yeah, I thought you'd never ask.

24:41.928 --> 24:44.693
- Bye.
- You guys have a good time, you crazy kids.

24:46.167 --> 24:48.637
- Hey, Connor.
- Hey.

24:48.805 --> 24:50.068
How you been?

24:50.241 --> 24:54.476
Well, I'm at a wedding,
I'm seeing ghosts in the john.

24:54.648 --> 24:56.640
- I've been better.
- All right.

24:56.818 --> 25:00.723
Well, what were you and Sandra's mom
talking about so intensely?

25:01.293 --> 25:02.726
Casual sex.

25:05.131 --> 25:08.125
So, what's your stance
on casual sex, bridesmaid?

25:08.303 --> 25:12.072
On top. I mean... I'm for it.

25:12.510 --> 25:15.743
Well, speaking of which,
I think I owe you an apology.

25:15.916 --> 25:20.288
I've enjoyed the company
of all the other bridesmaids except you.

25:20.456 --> 25:22.322
I mean, you must feel terribly left out.

25:23.796 --> 25:25.024
I do.

25:25.498 --> 25:30.369
Well, I do hope that there's some way
to rectify this injustice.

25:30.538 --> 25:35.137
Well, you know what I always say is,
"To think globally, act locally."

25:36.615 --> 25:39.678
Listen, before I, uh, commence
the launch code:

25:41.089 --> 25:44.960
Are you the one my brother slept with?
Because I don't like to cross swords.

25:45.130 --> 25:49.796
Wait, what? Your brother slept
with one of the bridesmaids?

25:49.971 --> 25:52.463
Okay, I guess it wasn't you.

25:52.641 --> 25:57.104
Okay, from now on, I don't cross swords.
Listen, forget I even brought it up.

25:57.282 --> 26:01.449
Hey, why don't you scamper up
to my room, boil some water...

26:01.623 --> 26:05.117
...get the chicken claw out of my suitcase,
do some light stretching...

26:05.296 --> 26:07.060
...and I will be up in 5?

26:07.734 --> 26:09.793
Chicken claw. Okay.

26:09.968 --> 26:12.496
- Chicken claw.
- Okay.

26:12.674 --> 26:17.079
Suitcase. Stretching. Scamper.
Five minutes.

26:17.248 --> 26:21.710
And that's how it's done, son.
That is how it's done.

26:22.189 --> 26:23.350
Does it work on guys?

26:25.193 --> 26:26.218
Probably.

26:26.396 --> 26:28.866
- Excuse me, mind if we take these seats?
- No, please.

26:29.034 --> 26:31.435
- All right.
- Oh, hello there, friend.

26:31.605 --> 26:33.470
- Hey.
- Connor Mead, brother of the groom.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.075
- This is Brad.
- Frye. Nice to meet you.

26:36.245 --> 26:37.975
Nice to meet you.

26:38.148 --> 26:40.777
You must be the wedding sex
they flew in for Jenny here.

26:41.453 --> 26:44.948
And, uh, you must be the wedding sex
they brought in for everyone else.

26:46.628 --> 26:51.626
He's getting his little blush. He's gotten
that ever since he was a kid. It's adorable.

26:51.804 --> 26:55.469
Oh, honey, if I was jealous, why am I,
at this very moment, heading upstairs...

26:55.643 --> 26:57.737
...to close out my hat trick
of bridesmaids?

27:00.884 --> 27:05.119
Maybe you're terrified of being alone with
your empty hollow soul for even a minute.

27:05.926 --> 27:09.420
- You got a live one here, Brad.
- Yeah, look, maybe I'd better go.

27:09.599 --> 27:12.434
- No, Brad, you're staying.
- I'll go.

27:12.604 --> 27:14.265
Run along, Connor.

27:14.440 --> 27:17.274
There's a bridesmaid waiting
to be partially satisfied.

27:17.444 --> 27:18.776
Absolutely.

27:18.947 --> 27:22.886
Brad, it's a pleasure. I hope you enjoy
pillow fights, talking about your feelings...

27:23.054 --> 27:25.523
...and sharing massages
with your clothes on.

27:26.091 --> 27:27.617
Jenny.

27:27.962 --> 27:29.123
Connor.

27:38.745 --> 27:40.475
I know...

27:42.886 --> 27:47.222
Brad. Guy probably irons his jeans.

27:48.361 --> 27:49.556
Well, that's more like it.

27:51.300 --> 27:54.863
And how is my little 6-foot,
legs-to-her-chin...

27:55.039 --> 27:58.134
...blond-haired, blue-eyed,
Happy Meal of a bridesmaid?

27:58.310 --> 28:00.006
- Hi, Connor! Ha, ha.
- Whoa!

28:00.180 --> 28:02.377
- Have you missed me?
- Who are you?

28:02.551 --> 28:05.647
What, you don't...? You don't remember?

28:14.803 --> 28:16.466
Allison Vandermeersh?

28:17.074 --> 28:20.477
Connor Mead...

28:21.113 --> 28:22.137
...remembers me.

28:22.583 --> 28:25.075
I can die now. I'm just kidding.
I'm totally kidding.

28:25.253 --> 28:27.450
- What are you doing here?
- I'm like a ghost now.

28:27.624 --> 28:29.787
Yeah, the ghost of girlfriends past,
in fact.

28:35.003 --> 28:36.300
Oh, it tickles a little bit.

28:38.375 --> 28:40.845
- There.
- Connor?

28:43.415 --> 28:45.408
Really? You're gonna outrun a ghost?

28:51.196 --> 28:54.531
We could do this all day, dude.

28:55.937 --> 28:57.734
All right, you're not real.

28:57.907 --> 28:59.603
No, you can't be. You're...

28:59.776 --> 29:02.576
You're just a repressed memory,
activated by all the booze...

29:02.749 --> 29:07.688
...and the trauma of Paulie getting married.
But you, you are not real.

29:08.223 --> 29:10.351
- All right. Well, have a nice trip.
- Whoa.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.862
See you next fall. Ha, ha.

29:14.299 --> 29:17.066
- Is that real enough for you, dude?
- Whoa, watch it.

29:17.238 --> 29:19.799
Be cool. All right,
what are you gonna do to me?

29:19.975 --> 29:21.500
Oh, no, it's gonna be rad, okay?

29:21.678 --> 29:24.514
I am gonna take you back
through all your past girlfriends...

29:24.684 --> 29:28.143
...then you and I can figure out
how you got your head so far up your ass.

29:28.322 --> 29:29.915
Ready, Freddie?

29:39.908 --> 29:40.843
Ta-da!

29:40.843 --> 29:41.638
Ta-da!

29:41.810 --> 29:43.473
All right, what the hell's going on?

29:43.647 --> 29:47.017
We're still at your Uncle Wayne's,
only now we're in 1982...

29:47.186 --> 29:50.453
...which is, of course,
the summer of your first relationship.

29:50.625 --> 29:52.093
Connor.

29:55.032 --> 29:59.368
Oh. Look at how cute you were.
I wanna squeeze you.

29:59.538 --> 30:00.563
- Yes!
- Oh.

30:00.741 --> 30:02.472
And we knew who she was, of course.

30:02.645 --> 30:03.805
Jenny Perotti.

30:04.547 --> 30:09.009
I win, 1:26 for you, 1:20 for me.
I beat you by 6.

30:09.187 --> 30:13.126
No way. It's your birthday.
I let you win as your gift.

30:13.294 --> 30:15.820
Uh-huh. Then what's that?

30:18.403 --> 30:22.604
- Can they see us?
- No, we're ghosts.

30:25.914 --> 30:27.075
Get out.

30:27.618 --> 30:30.919
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's great.

30:31.090 --> 30:34.323
- You're the best, Jenny.
- Really?

30:34.729 --> 30:36.322
What else do you think of me?

30:37.633 --> 30:38.760
Oh.

30:39.336 --> 30:40.531
I don't know.

30:40.706 --> 30:44.144
- You see how young they start?
- Shh. Watch.

30:44.845 --> 30:46.542
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:46.716 --> 30:49.949
Line it up, buddy. Get in there.

31:12.657 --> 31:15.126
This doesn't even look like you.

31:15.294 --> 31:17.091
You look like a girl.

31:18.466 --> 31:19.695
What, Connor?

31:20.602 --> 31:22.469
This is my favorite part.

31:22.639 --> 31:24.336
I'm gonna keep it forever.

31:25.978 --> 31:30.442
- "I'm gonna keep it forever."
- I don't think I said that. Did you edit this?

31:32.221 --> 31:33.621
I'm gonna keep it forever.

31:33.791 --> 31:37.923
You sure that wasn't my brother?
He always said fruity stuff like that.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.932
I'm gonna keep it forever.
Forever. Forever.

31:41.103 --> 31:42.934
Okay, I get it. I said it.

31:43.573 --> 31:45.098
I'm gonna keep it forever.

31:46.478 --> 31:48.572
Not as dumb as he looks, folks.

31:52.454 --> 31:55.049
- Go.
- Wait. This doesn't count.

31:55.225 --> 31:57.627
I wasn't ready, cheater.

32:02.069 --> 32:03.469
Mom and Dad.

32:05.541 --> 32:09.446
This was the summer
before their car accident.

32:11.618 --> 32:13.850
Look how happy they were.

32:19.932 --> 32:23.801
The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want. He maketh me...

32:23.972 --> 32:27.535
Uncle Wayne, Paul and Jenny
were all you had left.

32:29.046 --> 32:31.607
She knew you before you became...

32:31.783 --> 32:33.514
...you.

32:36.425 --> 32:38.052
All right.

32:39.029 --> 32:40.122
All right, what's next?

32:49.178 --> 32:51.705
Middle school? Really?

32:57.025 --> 33:00.930
- You remember this, right?
- Pretty sure I intentionally blocked it out.

33:01.365 --> 33:02.924
Whoo!

33:03.101 --> 33:04.728
Surely we don't have time for this.

33:04.903 --> 33:08.433
As you and Jenny got older, you
tried to make that super-tough transition...

33:08.610 --> 33:11.877
...from being best friends
to maybe being boyfriend/girlfriend.

33:12.049 --> 33:14.781
- This dance is so lame.
- Totally.

33:16.456 --> 33:19.917
I don't know why, but there's something
creepy about the white-glove thing.

33:20.096 --> 33:21.893
Oh, yeah.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.129
Nice move.

33:26.305 --> 33:29.367
Who's "ooh-ing" who,
Franklin Middle School?

33:29.544 --> 33:32.343
I'm gonna slow it down right now...

33:32.514 --> 33:39.118
...so guys, grab that special girl
and head on out to the dance floor.

33:41.029 --> 33:42.895
Ask her to dance, man.

33:43.366 --> 33:45.529
She's begging for it. Ask her.

33:45.703 --> 33:48.195
- So...
- Jenny! Oh, my God, Jenny.

33:48.374 --> 33:52.336
Neil just told Suzy that Pete Hastings
wants to slow dance with you.

33:52.514 --> 33:54.847
Pete Hastings is totally gorge.

33:56.420 --> 34:00.689
No, Pete Hastings is now bald and doing
Civil War reenactments on the weekends.

34:00.861 --> 34:03.798
Yeah, and he's gonna wanna make out.

34:03.967 --> 34:06.436
Yeah, and he's a ninth grader,
so that means tongue.

34:07.004 --> 34:09.873
Oh, my God, I can't believe
how lucky you are. Pete Hastings.

34:17.687 --> 34:18.882
Okay, I guess.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.389
Yes! Ha, ha.

34:20.860 --> 34:22.384
Yeah, but...

34:28.205 --> 34:31.735
That dude used to get boners
in the gym shower. Don't sweat it.

34:31.911 --> 34:33.708
But at least he didn't choke.

34:33.880 --> 34:37.909
Hey, I didn't choke, all right?
I could've closed if I wanted to.

34:39.690 --> 34:42.422
I was being a gentleman.

34:44.263 --> 34:45.389
I can't breathe.

34:51.577 --> 34:54.842
You know what? You didn't wanna
hit that anyway, little man.

35:13.245 --> 35:16.408
Hey, kid. What's with the waterworks?

35:17.083 --> 35:18.108
Jenny.

35:19.821 --> 35:21.915
- Pregnant?
- No.

35:22.091 --> 35:23.685
Crabs?

35:24.529 --> 35:25.554
No.

35:25.731 --> 35:28.861
Took her to the coat room,
found out she had a tenpin up her dress?

35:29.036 --> 35:30.835
Don't worry, it happens to all of us.

35:31.574 --> 35:33.064
Wait, what?

35:34.011 --> 35:36.140
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
So, what happened?

35:36.315 --> 35:39.911
Jenny kissed Pete Hastings tonight.

35:40.086 --> 35:43.217
Her first kiss. Now everything is ruined.

35:43.392 --> 35:45.862
I don't even know
if we're gonna get married anymore.

35:46.030 --> 35:47.795
Trust me, kid, you dodged a bullet.

35:47.967 --> 35:51.905
You don't wanna be anybody's first kiss,
or their last.

35:52.073 --> 35:55.306
Say what you will,
that man was a visionary.

35:55.478 --> 35:58.211
You know he invented the word "MILF"?

35:58.384 --> 36:01.946
What am I gonna do?
I've never felt this way before.

36:02.122 --> 36:04.922
I feel like someone has punched me
straight in the stomach...

36:05.094 --> 36:08.361
...and I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
God, I hate girls!

36:12.072 --> 36:13.974
That's sissy talk.

36:14.142 --> 36:17.739
Never talk like that
in the stabbing wagon.

36:17.915 --> 36:22.013
- Uncle Wayne, where are your seat belts?
- Again with the sissy talk.

36:23.957 --> 36:27.395
He never wore seat belts. Never.

36:27.931 --> 36:32.803
Look, kid,
I'm, uh, sorry I raised my voice at you.

36:32.972 --> 36:36.706
Being a parent ain't exactly
my chosen profession, you know?

36:37.213 --> 36:43.086
I mean, I can't teach you algebra,
or camping, or even ethics.

36:44.991 --> 36:47.655
But when it comes to dames...

36:48.765 --> 36:52.225
...l've got a gift.
- Really?

36:53.005 --> 36:56.875
Because I will do anything you say.

36:57.345 --> 37:00.942
I never wanna feel like this again. Ever.

37:01.117 --> 37:03.246
Okay, Dutch.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.385
Never again.

37:05.557 --> 37:06.582
Hang on.

37:13.404 --> 37:18.743
- Are we in a bar?
- Think of it like a classroom.

37:40.849 --> 37:44.184
Hiya, Tommy. Two Jacks. Up, please.

37:44.354 --> 37:48.020
Dutch, try that old saddle out for size.

37:50.263 --> 37:53.462
Don't look at them.

37:53.636 --> 37:56.868
Dames, they're like horses.
They spook easy.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.907
Cheers, Dutch.

38:03.419 --> 38:05.945
Never soil your wingman.

38:06.122 --> 38:08.354
- Sorry.
- You're learning on your feet.

38:08.527 --> 38:11.257
You know, if we were actually out,
uh, chasing tail tonight...

38:11.430 --> 38:13.901
...l'd turn your gaffe into a funny.

38:14.068 --> 38:18.166
Girls, they love to laugh.
Especially at men.

38:18.341 --> 38:22.974
Makes them feel more powerful, which
in turn makes them feel more comfortable.

38:23.149 --> 38:26.087
Which in turn makes them prone
to massive errors in judgment...

38:26.255 --> 38:30.284
...like, having sex with a complete stranger
in the port authority bathroom. Ha, ha.

38:30.462 --> 38:32.693
But I'm not even supposed
to talk to strangers.

38:32.865 --> 38:35.130
No, that's good, that's good.
No talking is good.

38:35.303 --> 38:39.105
No phone numbers, no last names.
Hey, no first names if you can swing it.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.677
Will somebody please
call Child Protective Services?

38:41.847 --> 38:43.543
Shh. Quiet, the prophet speaks.

38:43.717 --> 38:47.246
See, kid, an ugly broad, you might as well
take her out behind the shed...

38:47.423 --> 38:49.984
...and put one behind the ear.
That dog won't hunt.

38:50.160 --> 38:52.722
But any dude with a johnson,
he's got a shot...

38:52.898 --> 38:57.803
...because cool comes from the inside.
- God, I miss that man.

38:57.973 --> 38:59.441
So here's a couple of tips.

38:59.609 --> 39:04.447
When you first meet a girl, you give her
two compliments, above the neck.

39:04.617 --> 39:08.077
You tell her she's got nice lips,
nice eyes, nice hair...

39:08.256 --> 39:11.819
...she's intelligent, her moral ethics,
whatever crap comes to your mind.

39:11.995 --> 39:15.229
Then, just when she begins to think
that you're another, you know...

39:15.401 --> 39:19.305
...vanilla-nice guy that she can tool around
with all night without getting naked...

39:20.141 --> 39:25.981
...you insult her. Flip the power dynamic,
and you let her know you're here to play.

39:26.151 --> 39:30.420
- Well, Jenny said she doesn't like games.
- Forget about that broad.

39:30.592 --> 39:34.291
- I thought all this was to get her back.
- That's why you gotta forget about her.

39:34.464 --> 39:37.867
It's your feelings for her
that are killing your game.

39:38.405 --> 39:42.241
If there's one thing
that you learn tonight, it's this:

39:42.411 --> 39:47.647
The power of a relationship lies
with whoever cares less.

39:49.855 --> 39:51.620
Amen to that, brother.

39:51.793 --> 39:54.423
One day you're gonna wake up
with some chick, spooning...

39:54.598 --> 39:56.226
...you know, thinking about love.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.528
And at that moment,
you have gotta get up.

39:58.705 --> 40:01.606
Do not walk, don't get your shoes,
run the hell out of there.

40:01.774 --> 40:04.040
Because maybe not the next day
or the next week...

40:04.212 --> 40:07.945
...but sometime in the future,
you're gonna get crushed. Again.

40:08.753 --> 40:10.746
- You don't wanna feel that way, do you?
- No.

40:10.924 --> 40:12.687
- No.
- Yep.

40:12.859 --> 40:17.857
Okay, so, uh, let's get down
to brass tacks here.

40:18.435 --> 40:22.840
Say I wanted to pick up
on that ice-cold blond at eight o'clock.

40:23.009 --> 40:25.946
Eight o'clock? How did you even see her?

40:26.115 --> 40:28.914
We'll deal with reflective surfaces
at another time.

40:29.085 --> 40:31.921
Should I, uh, get a handful a daisies,
then go:

40:32.091 --> 40:34.059
"Hi, you wanna go to the disco with me?"

40:34.227 --> 40:35.787
Uh...

40:35.964 --> 40:36.989
- No?
- No.

40:37.166 --> 40:40.535
No, because I might as well say,
"I'm a fag. Let's be friends."

40:40.705 --> 40:45.576
So, what would be a smart play?
Have some fun with it. What do you think?

40:46.313 --> 40:48.111
I don't know. I mean...

40:48.283 --> 40:51.914
...you could maybe
talk to the girl next to her?

40:52.089 --> 40:53.854
You know, maybe make her feel jealous?

40:57.532 --> 41:03.475
Hand to God, kid, I never felt
like you were my son until now.

41:07.013 --> 41:10.918
Man, I don't know why we didn't have
this conversation years ago, huh?

41:11.555 --> 41:14.116
Well, that's enough for one night.
Let's hit the bricks.

41:14.292 --> 41:16.159
- But what about the blond?
- No, no, no.

41:16.329 --> 41:19.630
- You gotta throw the small ones back.
- Come on.

41:19.801 --> 41:22.533
- I mean, it just wouldn't be right.
- Please?

41:25.276 --> 41:26.869
This elevator's going down.

41:27.046 --> 41:30.244
Here we go.
Watch this move. Watch this move.

41:33.256 --> 41:37.696
I gotta say, I remember
the ladies being a bit more glamorous.

41:45.175 --> 41:49.512
And that, Dutch, is how it's done.
That's how it's done.

41:49.682 --> 41:51.582
But you just struck out.

41:51.752 --> 41:56.088
You know, just because she's not into that
doesn't mean I'm not.

41:57.962 --> 41:59.521
I've got a gift.

42:01.001 --> 42:05.668
Oh, well, hello, darling.
What took you so long? Hi.

42:05.842 --> 42:07.276
And you were never the same.

42:08.179 --> 42:09.876
Come on. Whoo!

42:16.258 --> 42:17.816
Vicky's basement.

42:17.994 --> 42:21.489
Yeah, I'd recognize that bachy smell
from anywhere.

42:21.668 --> 42:24.297
Oh, I know, it smells good.
Oh, there's Jenny.

42:24.872 --> 42:28.504
You didn't see her for two years
while you learned at the hand of the master.

42:31.250 --> 42:33.776
Hey, Connor's here.

42:41.565 --> 42:44.867
I, uh, got the new Poison.

42:47.643 --> 42:49.236
It's Connor Mead.

42:49.412 --> 42:52.645
I heard his uncle homeschooled
him in Vegas for the last two years.

42:52.818 --> 42:54.718
Really? I heard it was Bangkok.

42:57.157 --> 42:59.821
- Okay, it has been too long.
- Yeah!

42:59.996 --> 43:02.557
- Yeah!
- All right!

43:04.202 --> 43:06.434
- Nice move, buddy.
- Yeah.

43:06.606 --> 43:10.443
See, the worst part about your
uncle's advice was it actually worked.

43:10.613 --> 43:12.047
Thank God, Uncle Wayne.

43:14.052 --> 43:16.248
He so doesn't wanna talk to you.

43:16.422 --> 43:19.358
He looks like Duran Duran, both of them.

43:21.797 --> 43:24.198
Look, it's me.
Oh, my God, it's me, it's me. Ha, ha.

43:26.505 --> 43:31.605
Oh, my God.
We dated for the next 39 minutes...

43:31.781 --> 43:35.514
...and it was the best two-thirds of an hour
in my young life.

43:37.389 --> 43:39.722
Look at how happy we were.

43:39.893 --> 43:44.629
But, alas, our love was not meant to be.

43:46.403 --> 43:49.033
I mean, you didn't get the girl
that you really loved...

43:49.208 --> 43:51.905
...but you did get every other girl
in high school.

43:52.080 --> 43:55.985
Starting with me that very night.
You remember that, your first time?

43:56.153 --> 44:01.058
- No, no, no. I don't wanna see that.
- Oh, no, don't worry, it didn't last very...

44:01.227 --> 44:02.251
It's over.

44:09.440 --> 44:13.903
Connor Mead's first sex partner.
It's like, I feel...

44:14.081 --> 44:17.918
I feel like Neil Armstrong.
It's really the only thing I could equate...

44:18.088 --> 44:20.923
...you know, to what I did for you.

44:21.093 --> 44:25.623
You know, him on the moon,
me with you, it's like he was the first.

44:26.134 --> 44:28.366
You know, like,
Jenny was your first love...

44:28.538 --> 44:32.271
...but you had to grow 12 inches of hair
before you saw her again.

44:32.445 --> 44:36.281
Now, to my way of thinking,
every woman is beautiful in some way.

44:36.451 --> 44:39.787
I just have to figure out how.
I've gotta see it, I've gotta frame it...

44:39.957 --> 44:41.015
...l've gotta focus it.

44:42.461 --> 44:44.362
And then I shoot it.
Yeah, and it's immortalized.

44:44.531 --> 44:47.228
- Jenny, you want another Zima?
- Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.

44:47.401 --> 44:49.371
Jenny Perotti.

44:49.739 --> 44:51.469
Connor Mead.

44:51.642 --> 44:53.976
- Hey.
- Hey, it's me.

44:54.146 --> 44:56.741
- You look gorgeous, darling.
- Oh.

44:56.917 --> 44:59.251
Thank you, darling.

44:59.421 --> 45:02.085
Uh, ladies, you're gonna have to excuse me
for a moment.

45:02.259 --> 45:06.027
I must buy a drink for the girl who blew
me off for Pete Hastings in high school.

45:06.199 --> 45:09.135
- I didn't blow you off, you choked.
- I was slow playing you.

45:09.304 --> 45:10.704
- You choked.
- Excuse us for...

45:10.873 --> 45:13.274
Slow playing me?
For what, 10 years? Please.

45:13.443 --> 45:15.640
All right, maybe I choked.

45:15.814 --> 45:18.341
- So... Yeah.
- Jenny Perotti.

45:18.519 --> 45:20.579
What are you doing with all the women?

45:20.755 --> 45:23.693
I work for Herb Ritts.
You know, the famous photographer?

45:23.862 --> 45:26.263
- You're a photographer?
- I am.

45:26.665 --> 45:29.726
- I gave you your first camera.
- You sure did.

45:29.903 --> 45:32.601
- So, what are you...? What are you doing?
- I'm a doctor.

45:32.774 --> 45:35.266
- Well, first-year resident, but...
- Yeah.

45:35.445 --> 45:38.713
- But Herb Ritts. God, that's impressive.
- Yeah, I'm his second shooter.

45:38.885 --> 45:41.651
- That's great.
- I bank north of 150K a year.

45:41.823 --> 45:45.284
- It's totally killer, I love my job. Hector.
- Yeah?

45:48.667 --> 45:52.435
- I can't believe you just said that.
- I can't believe I just said that either.

45:52.606 --> 45:55.942
You told me your salary, and then
spoke Spanish to the old white guy.

45:56.113 --> 45:58.844
- You're totally cheesy now.
- Get out. I am not.

45:59.017 --> 46:02.114
- You gonna try to get me in the sack now?
- I'm the same old Connor.

46:02.290 --> 46:04.782
Damn right I'm gonna try
and get you in the sack now.

46:04.960 --> 46:07.430
Look at you, you are gorgeous.
What did you think?

46:07.598 --> 46:10.864
I was inviting you over here to have a drink
just to see how you been?

46:11.971 --> 46:14.600
- How have you been?
- Great.

46:14.776 --> 46:18.043
Pete Hastings and I are still together,
madly in love.

46:18.215 --> 46:21.778
- Damn it. I knew it.
- We live in a split-level in Jersey. It's love.

46:21.955 --> 46:25.518
- That son of a bitch.
- Lot of slow dancing, making out, tongue.

46:25.694 --> 46:27.891
And every now and then
I put on the red dress...

46:28.065 --> 46:30.500
No, pink. Pink dress.
...let him cup my bottom.

46:30.668 --> 46:32.864
- The hot-pink dress.
- What?

46:33.038 --> 46:38.104
That's the dress you were wearing when
you were dancing with Pete instead of me.

46:38.280 --> 46:39.909
Hey, Jen?

46:40.551 --> 46:41.916
We're leaving.

46:42.086 --> 46:44.454
But we can wait...

46:45.025 --> 46:46.492
Um...

46:47.996 --> 46:50.661
Nope. I'm going, thanks.

46:50.835 --> 46:54.795
- Whoa, just like that?
- Well, it was great seeing you.

46:54.973 --> 46:56.533
- Jenny.
- Take care.

46:56.710 --> 46:58.701
- Hang on a second.
- Come on.

46:58.880 --> 47:01.145
You gotta at least give me your number.

47:01.318 --> 47:03.913
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do, doc.

47:04.088 --> 47:08.152
I have a medical condition that I need to see
you about, and by law you have to help me.

47:08.328 --> 47:10.093
- What's your medical condition?
- Broken heart.

47:11.467 --> 47:14.164
Come on. Come on, we'll go out.
We'll have fun.

47:14.339 --> 47:17.673
We'll have a little dinner,
have a little sex.

47:17.911 --> 47:20.540
- Okay, okay, just sex.
- How about just dinner?

47:22.051 --> 47:23.110
Fine. Suit yourself.

47:23.888 --> 47:26.255
He's all yours, girls.

47:26.792 --> 47:30.389
All right, dinner's good. Dinner's good.

47:30.864 --> 47:33.096
Yeah. I love dinner.

47:33.269 --> 47:35.535
You know what?
I'm pretty hungry right now.

47:35.706 --> 47:38.609
- What do you say?
- All right. Well, on one condition.

47:38.777 --> 47:39.802
We gotta...

47:40.347 --> 47:42.816
We gotta button you up.
You look like a gay pirate.

47:44.821 --> 47:48.224
- Am I gonna have to call a cab for you?
- No, no, I live here.

47:48.393 --> 47:49.418
Oh, nice building.

47:49.595 --> 47:51.462
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.
- You could upgrade...

47:51.632 --> 47:54.967
...if you banked north of 150K a year...
- And fifty thousand dollars!

47:55.138 --> 47:56.663
...like I do!

47:56.841 --> 48:00.107
You gotta learn to say that
in Spanish for Hector.

48:00.278 --> 48:03.613
Wow, that self-deprecating shtick
really works.

48:03.784 --> 48:06.653
I might have to put that back
in my playbook.

48:06.823 --> 48:10.283
I'm genuinely concerned that you might be
missing the entire point of this.

48:10.462 --> 48:14.093
- Good night.
- Well, hang on a second.

48:14.268 --> 48:16.966
Let me help you carry your luggage up.

48:17.140 --> 48:21.772
- No. We just met today, sort of.
- What are you talking about?

48:21.946 --> 48:22.971
- No.
- Hey.

48:23.149 --> 48:25.675
We've known each other our whole lives.

48:25.853 --> 48:27.981
It's been too great a night
to end it out here.

48:29.760 --> 48:32.286
You've gotten really good at this.

48:33.699 --> 48:37.102
But you cannot come up.
I don't want this to be a one-night thing.

48:37.773 --> 48:40.403
So you've gotta woo me.

48:40.578 --> 48:44.071
Why woo when we can just do?

48:44.249 --> 48:45.717
- Ha, ha.
- Huh?

48:45.885 --> 48:48.515
The wooing is actually not for my benefit.

48:51.028 --> 48:52.461
Mm.

48:59.341 --> 49:02.836
I can't believe she called me
on my crap like that.

49:03.747 --> 49:06.843
That is not at all how I remember it.

49:10.024 --> 49:11.515
So, what's next?

49:11.694 --> 49:15.598
Well, now we're gonna watch
a romantic montage of you and Jenny...

49:15.767 --> 49:18.397
...set to Cyndi Lauper's
"Time After Time."

49:46.517 --> 49:48.917
Awake me when
there's an action sequence, will you?

49:49.087 --> 49:50.555
Shh.

49:55.531 --> 49:57.626
- Hello, ladies, how are you?
- Oh, good.

49:59.237 --> 50:00.865
Great. Thank you so much.

50:01.041 --> 50:04.341
Everything was great.
Do you have a dessert menu?

50:08.119 --> 50:09.142
What are you...?

50:15.195 --> 50:19.431
And then,
after several weeks of wooing...

50:24.078 --> 50:26.013
Ah, here we go.

50:27.082 --> 50:28.449
Whoo!

50:32.124 --> 50:34.092
Oh, yeah.

50:35.328 --> 50:36.921
That was amazing.

50:37.098 --> 50:41.094
I can't imagine why.
We only had 20 years of foreplay.

50:55.293 --> 50:57.422
Oh, yeah.

51:03.341 --> 51:05.503
- What are you doing?
- Uh, I gotta get home.

51:05.678 --> 51:08.342
I got something early in the morning
I gotta take care of.

51:08.516 --> 51:11.248
Yeah, me too. The alarm is already set.

51:11.721 --> 51:15.181
Look, Jenny, I don't, uh, stay over,
you know what I mean?

51:15.360 --> 51:19.162
Wait, Connor, listen.
There are two types of women in this world.

51:19.332 --> 51:22.997
Women you shag and leave,
and women you shag and snuggle.

51:23.173 --> 51:26.143
Regrettably,
I'm the shag-and-snuggle kind.

51:26.310 --> 51:30.307
So you have 3 seconds
to get back in this bed where you belong...

51:30.485 --> 51:33.148
...and where, deep down,
you actually wanna be.

51:33.322 --> 51:36.760
Or you can march out of my apartment
and never call me again.

51:36.928 --> 51:38.452
One...

51:39.031 --> 51:40.556
...two...

51:45.575 --> 51:46.702
Three.

51:51.551 --> 51:54.386
Not as dumb as he looks, folks.

51:55.692 --> 51:59.255
This is the moment
you truly fell in love with Jenny.

51:59.663 --> 52:01.860
You completely let her in.

52:02.335 --> 52:06.866
And this is the moment that you realized
you were spooning.

52:09.180 --> 52:11.843
So you did what you do best.

52:41.532 --> 52:43.125
All right, I don't wanna see this.

52:43.301 --> 52:44.326
Of course not.

52:47.341 --> 52:48.900
I called.

52:49.077 --> 52:51.547
Good. I don't remember calling.

52:51.715 --> 52:53.308
Hello?

52:53.818 --> 52:55.343
Oh.

52:56.723 --> 52:58.659
No, this is Dr. Perotti.

52:59.962 --> 53:01.863
Okay. Yup.

53:02.032 --> 53:04.092
I'll be there in 15.

53:05.003 --> 53:06.664
Okay, good.

53:15.553 --> 53:20.620
And that was the last stop
before you officially became Connor Mead.

53:22.130 --> 53:25.364
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

53:34.651 --> 53:38.350
After Jenny, your relationships
grew shorter and shorter.

53:38.523 --> 53:41.393
So short, in fact, that it would be easier
to do this in bulk.

53:41.562 --> 53:44.123
- You remember Amy, the stewardess?
- Hey, Connor.

53:44.300 --> 53:49.501
We had plane sex somewhere over Albany.
And Rochester. And South Bend, Indiana.

53:49.675 --> 53:51.268
Triple whammy.

53:52.046 --> 53:54.037
You slept with my sister.

53:54.214 --> 53:56.777
I was Shawna back then.
A waitress at the Palm.

53:56.954 --> 53:59.753
- We had coatroom sex on my smoke break.
- That was you?

54:05.367 --> 54:06.892
We dated for two days.

54:07.070 --> 54:08.801
- For an hour.
- For 48 seconds.

54:08.974 --> 54:11.033
- We had sex in your car.
- On your car.

54:11.209 --> 54:12.575
While I washed your car.

54:12.745 --> 54:14.942
- You never called me again.
- Never called again.

54:15.116 --> 54:18.713
Every time you slept with me,
you called me Jenny.

54:19.189 --> 54:21.317
Right. How much more of this do I have?

54:21.492 --> 54:22.721
Um, a lot.

54:24.264 --> 54:25.664
Oh, wow.

54:25.834 --> 54:28.565
Okay, this is getting kind of weird.

54:28.738 --> 54:31.642
- We miss you, Connor.
- Connor, stay with us.

54:31.810 --> 54:34.438
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

54:34.613 --> 54:37.083
- I need you, Connor.
- Hey, back off.

54:38.487 --> 54:41.890
- Get off!
- I'm obsessed with you, Connor.

54:42.060 --> 54:43.425
Get off!

54:43.595 --> 54:45.257
- <i>I love you, Connor!</i>
- <i>Get</i>...

54:45.832 --> 54:47.300
Ow!

54:49.271 --> 54:51.069
Nightmare.

54:52.811 --> 54:54.300
Alcohol.

54:54.478 --> 54:58.315
It's not complicated.
Our guests are represented by the Allies.

54:58.485 --> 55:01.149
Paul, you and your guests are Nazis.

55:01.323 --> 55:02.916
I'll try not to read into that, sir.

55:03.093 --> 55:05.996
Blue frogmen are non-requisite
support personnel.

55:06.165 --> 55:09.399
Waiters, photographers, caterers,
band members and so forth.

55:09.571 --> 55:12.132
Oh, Donna, look.
You got a grenade launcher.

55:12.308 --> 55:15.474
Oh, my God, I love grenade launchers.
Thank you.

55:15.648 --> 55:18.310
Daddy, you're not showing off
your seating chart, are you?

55:18.484 --> 55:22.924
- Oh, come on. It's perfect.
- It's really impeccable.

55:24.394 --> 55:26.091
I didn't even get a machine gun.

55:26.264 --> 55:28.392
Alcohol. Alcohol.

55:32.774 --> 55:34.174
Alcohol.

55:40.487 --> 55:42.650
What's left in here?

55:43.290 --> 55:44.918
All right.

55:56.045 --> 55:57.513
Oh. Oh. Uh...

55:57.681 --> 55:59.378
Not good.

56:00.084 --> 56:03.147
Okay, not good. Not good.
Where's the leg?

56:03.824 --> 56:05.258
Okay.

56:14.275 --> 56:16.642
Something to hold you up.

56:16.811 --> 56:18.279
Bottle.

56:19.283 --> 56:20.615
Okay, that'll work.

56:24.658 --> 56:27.492
Okay, sarge and Sandy.

56:27.662 --> 56:29.427
Yeah, there you go.

56:29.599 --> 56:31.899
And Paul and Mrs. Volcom.

56:32.070 --> 56:33.537
Try to keep up, son.

56:33.705 --> 56:36.370
- Then the rest of the wedding party joins in.
- Hey.

56:36.544 --> 56:38.638
- All right.
- Here we go.

56:39.950 --> 56:42.443
Watch out for the flowers.

56:45.224 --> 56:47.694
- Would you like to dance?
- Oh, thank you...

56:47.861 --> 56:49.955
...but I'm just watching the...
- Jenny, dance.

56:50.131 --> 56:51.760
Come on.

56:53.905 --> 56:55.999
Oh, nice frame.

56:56.175 --> 56:57.769
I see.

57:00.949 --> 57:02.212
Where'd you learn to dance?

57:02.385 --> 57:05.254
- I spent some time in Colombia.
- What, are you a drug mule?

57:05.423 --> 57:06.981
No, Doctors Without Borders.

57:07.159 --> 57:11.222
- I know, he's perfect.
- Shut up.

57:20.849 --> 57:23.614
Hey! Shh, shh.

57:29.728 --> 57:34.795
- What else are you ridiculously good at?
- He's certified in shiatsu massage.

57:34.971 --> 57:36.303
Is it weird that I know that?

57:36.473 --> 57:38.238
- Yeah.
- A little. Ha, ha.

58:05.153 --> 58:07.782
What's going...? Oh, God.

58:07.958 --> 58:10.292
Oh, my God, the cake.
Did you see what happened?

58:10.463 --> 58:11.793
Oh, my God.

58:11.963 --> 58:15.231
Okay, look, these things
are not very well-engineered, all right?

58:15.403 --> 58:17.964
They're very rickety.

58:18.140 --> 58:21.601
- Here we go.
- No!

58:21.780 --> 58:24.717
I can totally fix this.

58:27.056 --> 58:31.290
If it's any consolation,
the cake really wasn't very good.

58:33.297 --> 58:36.997
You had a piece?

58:37.171 --> 58:41.041
Look, it splattered into my mouth
upon impact, all right?

58:41.211 --> 58:47.415
- It was unavoidable.
- It is a wedding cake, you stupid bitch.

58:47.588 --> 58:50.217
Not a rehearsal-dinner cake!

58:50.392 --> 58:52.589
- I hate you!
- No, no, no, Sandy, Sandy. Release.

58:52.763 --> 58:54.163
- Release. Release.
- Aah! Aah!

58:54.966 --> 58:56.901
He's not worth it, sweetheart.

58:57.069 --> 58:59.733
I'm fine. I'm fine.

58:59.908 --> 59:02.173
I am a lady.

59:02.344 --> 59:04.940
I am a professional.

59:05.484 --> 59:07.715
And I'm fine.

59:08.388 --> 59:11.882
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay, see if you can stabilize the bride.

59:12.060 --> 59:15.328
I've got the cake and childcare.
Brad, some shiatsu for Sandra, please?

59:15.500 --> 59:17.058
Let's see some happy faces.

59:17.469 --> 59:18.528
Big happy, big happy.

59:18.704 --> 59:20.731
Oh, where do you think you're going?

59:21.476 --> 59:23.570
- Breathe.
- Let me know if the pressure's okay.

59:23.745 --> 59:25.408
There you go.

59:26.551 --> 59:28.610
- Thank you, Denice.
- Thank you.

59:28.787 --> 59:30.916
- Okay. Oh, that's good.
- She's freaking out.

59:31.091 --> 59:33.560
- I know.
- Connor is ruining the wedding.

59:33.729 --> 59:36.757
He is also ruining
Operation Sex For Every Bridesmaid.

59:36.934 --> 59:38.835
- I almost hooked up with Connor.
- What?

59:39.003 --> 59:41.530
When he told me to go by his room,
the door was locked.

59:41.708 --> 59:43.439
I could hear him talking to himself.

59:43.612 --> 59:45.204
Dude, that guy takes mind games...

59:45.380 --> 59:47.350
...to the next level.
- Old school.

59:47.518 --> 59:49.750
- So who's next?
- I'm up.

59:49.921 --> 59:52.221
Oh, wait. Are you the one
that slept with Paul?

59:52.392 --> 59:54.089
- No.
- Because he won't go there.

59:54.730 --> 59:58.099
- Ew. What?
- That would be me.

59:59.571 --> 01:00:02.336
- Shut up. Shut your face.
- No. You never told us that.

01:00:02.508 --> 01:00:06.038
Well, I'm paying the price. Looks like
I'm gonna have to get plastered...

01:00:06.215 --> 01:00:08.878
...and downgrade
to one of Paul's desperate work friends.

01:00:09.052 --> 01:00:11.614
I can transmit, page, pilot
and sync channels now.

01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:15.023
- What channel are you on?
- Hey, guys, holster them.

01:00:15.864 --> 01:00:17.799
- Why?
- Women.

01:00:17.967 --> 01:00:19.128
Oh.

01:00:19.303 --> 01:00:21.330
- Say it isn't so.
- They're so weird.

01:00:24.209 --> 01:00:28.945
- Yeah, somebody is enjoying this a little bit.
- Ha, ha. Are you kidding me?

01:00:29.117 --> 01:00:32.886
Connor Mead, cleaning up his own mess.
I am loving it.

01:00:33.925 --> 01:00:36.418
You know what? I'm sorry.

01:00:37.031 --> 01:00:39.500
It's a cake.
There'll be a bakery open in town.

01:00:39.668 --> 01:00:42.537
I'm not talking about this.

01:00:43.141 --> 01:00:47.044
I'm talking about us. You know?

01:00:47.347 --> 01:00:49.681
How it played out.

01:00:49.852 --> 01:00:52.185
You're actually apologizing, aren't you?

01:00:52.356 --> 01:00:55.259
Okay, we don't need
to make a production out of it, now.

01:00:55.427 --> 01:00:58.090
How are things looking? Spick-and-span?
Any more spots?

01:00:58.265 --> 01:01:02.967
You know, it was probably,
in some small way, partially my fault.

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:05.939
- I was always attracted to assholes.
- Thank you very much.

01:01:06.111 --> 01:01:09.913
Well, you know what I mean, though.
Projects. Guys that I thought I could fix.

01:01:10.084 --> 01:01:12.553
Probably has something to do
with my dad.

01:01:12.755 --> 01:01:15.692
- Probably.
- After you left, I made a vow to myself...

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:18.558
...to date only fully functional,
well-adjusted men.

01:01:18.731 --> 01:01:24.263
- No more works-in-progress. No dirtbags.
- So basically, women.

01:01:24.441 --> 01:01:26.103
Basically women.

01:01:26.277 --> 01:01:31.809
So how strong of a vow
is your no-dirtbags policy?

01:01:31.986 --> 01:01:34.547
I had it tattooed on my ass.

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:38.891
- Can I see?
- No.

01:01:40.299 --> 01:01:42.097
- Wait, what are you doing?
- What?

01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:43.670
- What?
- What am I doing? Wha...?

01:01:43.839 --> 01:01:48.472
Okay, look. I know I dropped the ball
before a bit, but I have changed, I swear.

01:01:48.647 --> 01:01:50.114
- No, you haven't.
- No, I have.

01:01:50.282 --> 01:01:54.483
Jenny, I'm seeing things
in a whole different way tonight.

01:01:54.656 --> 01:01:58.253
All right? I love you. I think.
I mean, I always have.

01:01:58.428 --> 01:02:01.888
- You're the one I was supposed to be with.
- Wait, Connor, stop it. Just...

01:02:02.502 --> 01:02:06.168
I hear what you're saying,
and I think right now you actually believe it.

01:02:06.342 --> 01:02:09.802
- Yeah.
- But I know you.

01:02:11.116 --> 01:02:13.585
Tomorrow morning, I'll wake up.

01:02:14.888 --> 01:02:16.652
You won't be there.

01:02:17.593 --> 01:02:21.498
Okay, but, Jenny, I really, really don't
wanna be alone tonight, you know?

01:02:21.666 --> 01:02:23.999
- Okay. No, I get it.
- Will you please stay with me?

01:02:24.737 --> 01:02:27.766
Seriously!
Jenny, I've got ghosts in my bedroom!

01:02:31.682 --> 01:02:33.742
- Hello, Connor.
- Aah!

01:02:35.687 --> 01:02:36.951
Dude.

01:02:37.124 --> 01:02:40.926
What does a girl have to do
to get laid at this wedding?

01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:47.634
Yeah. Four Seasons, please.

01:02:51.748 --> 01:02:54.741
- Come on, start. Aah!
- Where do you think you're going?

01:02:57.055 --> 01:03:01.791
Oh, Mel. God, you don't know
how happy I am to see you.

01:03:02.598 --> 01:03:04.157
Aah!

01:03:04.335 --> 01:03:07.396
Really, did you learn nothing
from the last ghost?

01:03:07.874 --> 01:03:09.900
- You're the ghost of girlfriends present?
- Mm-hm.

01:03:10.077 --> 01:03:12.411
- That makes no sense.
- Oh, tell me about it.

01:03:12.581 --> 01:03:15.815
But as sad as it is,
I'm the only consistent woman in your life.

01:03:15.987 --> 01:03:20.187
So here I am,
just working on the weekend. Again.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.851
But we never...

01:03:22.029 --> 01:03:23.498
I mean, you...

01:03:23.665 --> 01:03:25.726
- You're totally gay, right?
- What?

01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:26.928
You're not?

01:03:27.105 --> 01:03:31.168
No. There was just one time in college.
I went to Barnard.

01:03:31.345 --> 01:03:32.939
- Okay.
- I had no choice.

01:03:33.115 --> 01:03:34.707
Hey, I'm sorry, Mel.

01:03:34.884 --> 01:03:37.446
If I'd have known,
I would of hit on you a lot sooner.

01:03:37.622 --> 01:03:39.523
Aw. Ha, ha.

01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:43.356
- Ow! What was that for?
- Because tonight, I'm the boss.

01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:44.999
You ready?

01:03:49.675 --> 01:03:51.734
What are you doing?

01:03:53.581 --> 01:03:57.212
Aren't we gonna, like,
fly off or something?

01:03:57.387 --> 01:04:01.155
It's the present, you idiot.
We're here already.

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:07.492
Mel.

01:04:08.437 --> 01:04:11.432
- Okay, no. That is not what I said.
- I don't care.

01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:13.738
He's a beautiful piece of a man.

01:04:13.913 --> 01:04:18.046
Hey, look at how much fun they're having
now that you're gone.

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:20.046
- He's not shallow.
- Shallow?

01:04:20.223 --> 01:04:23.058
Honey, he spends every Christmas alone
at the Knicks game.

01:04:23.228 --> 01:04:24.354
Yeah, he is all surface.

01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:28.128
Yeah, but in his defense,
it's a really hot surface.

01:04:28.303 --> 01:04:30.397
- Well, yeah.
- Okay, he's not that bad.

01:04:30.573 --> 01:04:34.012
- Thank you, Paulie.
- Paul, he hit on your mother in law.

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.979
- I've banged worse.
- Thank you, Vonda.

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:38.710
Oh!

01:04:38.887 --> 01:04:42.120
You guys just don't know him like I do.
You don't.

01:04:42.293 --> 01:04:44.626
You know, that guy practically raised me.

01:04:45.097 --> 01:04:50.368
I was 2 when our parents died.
Connor was just 7.

01:04:50.973 --> 01:04:56.438
You know, at an age when he's supposed
to be a kid, he's busy taking care of one.

01:04:56.915 --> 01:04:59.010
He taught me how to read.

01:05:00.555 --> 01:05:03.320
He taught me how to ride a bike.

01:05:04.428 --> 01:05:08.423
He beat the crap out of any kid
who ever teased me.

01:05:08.601 --> 01:05:12.939
You know, he always said,
"Paulie, it's you and me against the world."

01:05:14.144 --> 01:05:19.517
My point is, I had the opportunity
to be a nice kid and Connor didn't.

01:05:19.986 --> 01:05:23.516
Now, I know he seems like a joke
to you guys...

01:05:23.693 --> 01:05:28.962
...and trust me, you all have fair points,
but that guy is the only family I've got.

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:30.966
And if there's one thing family does...

01:05:31.137 --> 01:05:36.043
...it is believe, against all odds,
in the best of each other.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:42.581
I love him.

01:05:42.757 --> 01:05:46.752
And as long as I live,
I'll believe he can change, because he's...

01:05:47.765 --> 01:05:49.733
He's my big brother.

01:05:54.441 --> 01:05:56.434
I'm gonna call my brother.

01:05:56.612 --> 01:05:58.171
It's been a while.

01:05:59.584 --> 01:06:01.781
Of course,
that doesn't mean anything to you.

01:06:02.255 --> 01:06:04.451
Because love doesn't exist, right?

01:06:04.625 --> 01:06:08.723
It's just, "magical comfort food
for the weak and uneducated"?

01:06:08.899 --> 01:06:14.168
Wow, that is as close as I will ever come
to feeling something for Connor Mead.

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:16.776
- Kudos.
- I saw you chatting him up at the bar.

01:06:17.412 --> 01:06:22.443
Well, I still wanna do him,
but now I'll be scrumping a tragic figure.

01:06:22.621 --> 01:06:26.890
Ooh, like when Denice hooked up
with Gary Coleman at Lollapalooza.

01:06:27.462 --> 01:06:31.663
I was drunk
and he had such delicate hands.

01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:36.037
Denice, you think that's bad? I mean,
look at what Connor is doing to poor Jenny.

01:06:36.209 --> 01:06:39.237
He has got that girl so twisted up
into a pretzel...

01:06:39.414 --> 01:06:42.681
...she can't even appreciate
that fine slice of wedding beefcake...

01:06:42.853 --> 01:06:45.688
...that Sandy has flown in for her.

01:06:45.859 --> 01:06:47.326
Hua! Ha, ha.

01:06:48.596 --> 01:06:51.533
Heard, understood, acknowledged?

01:06:55.507 --> 01:06:56.702
Jenny, she's just...

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.243
Jenny.

01:07:09.295 --> 01:07:12.665
- Oh, Jesus. Is she okay?
- What do you think?

01:07:12.835 --> 01:07:14.234
Jenny?

01:07:15.472 --> 01:07:18.807
Oh, of course.
Sensitive Brad to the rescue.

01:07:18.978 --> 01:07:23.543
Now, wait a second, are you actually trying
to repair this wedding cake?

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.547
Maybe.

01:07:26.457 --> 01:07:30.259
- I mean, a little.
- I used to moonlight as a pastry chef.

01:07:30.429 --> 01:07:33.424
- Tell me this guy's gay.
- He's not. Trust me.

01:07:33.602 --> 01:07:35.661
- Really?
- No. Not really.

01:07:38.676 --> 01:07:40.406
You wanna talk about it?

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:43.573
As your designated wedding sex,
everything you say is privileged.

01:07:43.751 --> 01:07:45.550
No, I just...

01:07:45.721 --> 01:07:49.955
I mean, it's been like a decade
since Connor and l... You know.

01:07:50.763 --> 01:07:54.201
But I see him again, and I am just right back
to where I was before.

01:07:54.368 --> 01:07:57.601
My attending in med school used to say
that doctors never break up...

01:07:57.774 --> 01:08:02.077
...we just go into remission. We're naturally
drawn to the most hopeless patients.

01:08:02.248 --> 01:08:05.150
The irredeemably screwed up.
The terminal cases.

01:08:05.319 --> 01:08:09.315
- We get the point, Brad.
- It's just embarrassing, you know?

01:08:09.492 --> 01:08:11.553
I think you only really
get over somebody...

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:15.133
...when you find somebody else
that you care about more.

01:08:15.703 --> 01:08:18.002
All right, this is a nightmare.

01:08:18.174 --> 01:08:19.640
I'm bringing them together.

01:08:20.444 --> 01:08:22.276
- This is a mess.
- He's really cute too.

01:08:22.447 --> 01:08:26.145
No, no, no. No way.
Jenny doesn't go for guys like this.

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:29.416
No, clearly not. Come on, let's go.

01:08:29.591 --> 01:08:32.187
No, no, no. Now hang on.
Let's see how this plays out.

01:08:32.363 --> 01:08:33.956
Okay. You're the boss.

01:08:34.667 --> 01:08:36.157
Really?

01:08:36.837 --> 01:08:39.671
- Such a <i>shvantza.</i>
- What the hell was that fo...?

01:08:39.841 --> 01:08:44.008
I just can't believe he broke up with us
on a conference call.

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.774
How did he fool all of us?

01:08:45.951 --> 01:08:47.943
Yeah, but the weirdest thing, really...

01:08:48.121 --> 01:08:50.648
...it seems like he wanted us
to fall in love with him.

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:56.233
And once we did, or thought we did,
he just disappeared.

01:08:56.836 --> 01:08:59.031
How messed up is that?

01:08:59.473 --> 01:09:01.339
Come on, Kiki. Don't cry.

01:09:01.511 --> 01:09:03.741
At least Connor brought us
all together, right?

01:09:03.913 --> 01:09:07.145
Hey, there we go, Charlece.
That's the winning attitude, huh?

01:09:07.318 --> 01:09:09.082
Way to look on the bright side.

01:09:09.255 --> 01:09:13.216
You've already got new relationships,
new friendships, right?

01:09:13.395 --> 01:09:15.023
Here we go.

01:09:15.198 --> 01:09:18.328
It's so exciting to have people over.
Martini?

01:09:18.504 --> 01:09:20.598
- Oh, this is your apartment?
- Liquor, good.

01:09:20.774 --> 01:09:21.799
Mel.

01:09:21.975 --> 01:09:26.506
I've got apple, bubble gum or tandoori.

01:09:27.051 --> 01:09:29.247
I know it sounds gross,
but drink two of them...

01:09:29.421 --> 01:09:31.754
...and you won't be able
to feel your face. Cheers.

01:09:31.925 --> 01:09:33.393
You brought them together?

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:38.160
Come on. Don't be sad, you whiny bitches.
Connor's not worth it.

01:09:38.335 --> 01:09:41.466
He's like the Tin Man.
He was born without a heart.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.109
And, ladies, know this:

01:09:44.278 --> 01:09:46.875
That wherever
Connor lays his head tonight...

01:09:47.051 --> 01:09:51.386
...when the sun comes up in the morning,
he will be all alone.

01:09:51.557 --> 01:09:55.393
- Well, I'll drink to that.
- I feel much better.

01:10:00.471 --> 01:10:02.771
So how you holding up, Dutch?

01:10:03.843 --> 01:10:06.177
- Not too great.
- Yeah.

01:10:08.452 --> 01:10:10.648
Why do all these women hate me?

01:10:10.822 --> 01:10:13.155
You know, I don't hate them.

01:10:13.325 --> 01:10:16.956
Woman love to be screwed,
they just don't like to be screwed over.

01:10:17.598 --> 01:10:19.431
I know, it's annoying.

01:10:19.602 --> 01:10:24.942
Yeah. I mean... Look, all right,
maybe I've hurt a few women in my time.

01:10:25.112 --> 01:10:30.519
A few women? Dutch, please.
Don't con a con man.

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:39.432
- Oh, is this weather tricks?
- No tricks, Dutch.

01:10:39.601 --> 01:10:45.066
These are all the lady tears
that have been shed for you in your life.

01:10:52.989 --> 01:10:54.583
And these...

01:10:55.894 --> 01:11:00.891
These are the tissues they used
to dry those tears.

01:11:02.571 --> 01:11:05.234
And these are the chocolates you sent.

01:11:07.379 --> 01:11:10.748
Right. You don't send chocolates.
They go straight to the hips.

01:11:10.918 --> 01:11:11.943
Right.

01:11:12.455 --> 01:11:15.289
And these are all the condoms you used.

01:11:15.459 --> 01:11:16.619
No.

01:11:16.793 --> 01:11:19.924
No! No! No!

01:11:33.121 --> 01:11:35.216
- No, don't!
- Get off! Get off!

01:11:35.392 --> 01:11:38.021
- Don't! You're out of control!
- Shut up!

01:11:38.195 --> 01:11:39.492
Man, oh, man.

01:11:39.664 --> 01:11:43.158
You guys are not gonna believe
what just happened to me in my car.

01:11:47.044 --> 01:11:48.636
Is this about the cake?

01:11:48.812 --> 01:11:52.410
This is not about the cake. This is about
the fact that Paul slept with Donna.

01:11:52.585 --> 01:11:55.681
Information that you so kindly shared
with Denice earlier tonight.

01:11:55.857 --> 01:11:59.158
Come on. All right, number one,
that was years ago.

01:11:59.329 --> 01:12:01.798
There seems to be some debate
about the time line.

01:12:01.966 --> 01:12:05.734
No, there is no debate. We were going out.
We were together.

01:12:05.906 --> 01:12:08.434
- You cheated.
- We had just met. But you're right.

01:12:08.611 --> 01:12:12.640
You're right. That's not important. What's
important is that I hurt you. Listen, baby...

01:12:12.818 --> 01:12:15.789
You know what? Don't "listen, baby" me.
You had sex with her...

01:12:15.956 --> 01:12:19.827
...and then you didn't even tell me.
I mean, what else don't I know about you?

01:12:19.996 --> 01:12:22.659
Nothing. Nothing. There is nothing else.

01:12:22.834 --> 01:12:26.168
Okay, I am so sorry.
Sweetie, I never meant to hurt you.

01:12:26.339 --> 01:12:31.541
Cool. Right there. Hey, he said it.
He's sorry. He means it. Case closed.

01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:36.212
"Case closed." Because one apology
makes everything all better, right, Connor?

01:12:36.389 --> 01:12:40.988
No, Jenny. What makes it okay
is that Paul still clearly loves her.

01:12:41.164 --> 01:12:43.928
Oh, you're the expert on love.
You don't even believe in it.

01:12:44.101 --> 01:12:48.130
If I can tell that you two love each other,
then you must really love each other.

01:12:48.307 --> 01:12:50.573
You know I do, honey.
I love you so much.

01:12:50.745 --> 01:12:54.946
That girl's been acting like a mental patient
for 12 hours. He's still here.

01:12:55.119 --> 01:12:56.314
- Shut up.
- The point is...

01:12:56.488 --> 01:12:58.390
...how does she even trust him anymore?

01:12:58.559 --> 01:13:01.791
Whoa, are you talking about my brother,
or are you talking about me?

01:13:01.964 --> 01:13:05.901
Let's not forget, this all went down
with your dear friend Donna over there.

01:13:06.069 --> 01:13:09.439
A fact your little estrogen lynch mob
seems to have forgotten.

01:13:09.909 --> 01:13:14.748
Seriously, if you ruled out marrying anyone
that your bridesmaids have slept with...

01:13:14.918 --> 01:13:17.251
...you're gonna have to go abroad
to get a husband.

01:13:17.422 --> 01:13:19.254
Go to hell, Connor.

01:13:19.425 --> 01:13:20.654
- Sandy...
- Paulie, come on...

01:13:20.827 --> 01:13:24.961
- Connor, I want you to leave.
- You better air these things out...

01:13:25.135 --> 01:13:26.967
Connor, leave!

01:13:27.138 --> 01:13:31.770
God, you have done nothing
but make this weekend worse for everyone.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:36.417
- Sandy!
- Paulie!

01:13:37.855 --> 01:13:40.690
Hey, come on. Hey, Paulie.
Hey, hey, man. Look, I'm sorry.

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:43.660
They were right.
I never should have invited you.

01:13:44.365 --> 01:13:47.097
You know, for years
I keep trying to convince myself...

01:13:47.271 --> 01:13:49.671
...there's something redeemable in you.

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.308
I'm done. There isn't.

01:13:51.476 --> 01:13:53.968
I was just trying to get your back
in there, okay?

01:13:55.516 --> 01:13:59.955
- It's you and me against the world, right?
- You don't wanna be here.

01:14:00.725 --> 01:14:02.523
And nobody wants you here.

01:14:02.695 --> 01:14:05.290
So just go. Jus... Please?

01:14:05.933 --> 01:14:06.958
Sandy!

01:14:12.176 --> 01:14:15.841
I know I've got
one more ghost left on my contract...

01:14:16.016 --> 01:14:18.919
...but I've been asked
to leave the premises!

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:22.149
So if you want me, come on!

01:14:23.261 --> 01:14:26.357
Of course, I wouldn't mind seeing
my future girlfriends.

01:14:26.534 --> 01:14:30.870
Frankly, that was the ghost
I was most looking forward to!

01:14:31.309 --> 01:14:32.776
But whatever!

01:14:48.969 --> 01:14:50.232
Whoa.

01:14:55.913 --> 01:14:58.247
Are you my future girlfriend?

01:15:03.827 --> 01:15:06.422
Would you like to be?

01:15:58.615 --> 01:16:00.411
Oh, hell, no.

01:16:00.584 --> 01:16:02.314
I get married?

01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:11.060
Oh.

01:16:11.869 --> 01:16:13.736
Okay, this could work.

01:16:14.507 --> 01:16:19.379
As a matter of fact, this may be all right.

01:16:21.552 --> 01:16:22.984
Brad?

01:16:23.154 --> 01:16:24.850
No.

01:16:25.023 --> 01:16:27.458
No, no, no.

01:16:27.627 --> 01:16:28.720
No, no, no.

01:16:28.896 --> 01:16:32.858
And now, if anyone here knows any reason
why these two should not be wed...

01:16:33.036 --> 01:16:34.868
- I do.
- let them speak now...

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:37.032
No, Jenny,
you're supposed to be with me.

01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:42.550
She was always supposed to be with me.
No. Don't do this. This is wrong. No.

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:47.352
No! I'm here. I'm here.
Jenny. I'm here. No.

01:16:47.527 --> 01:16:49.758
No!

01:17:20.347 --> 01:17:21.939
Oh, Paulie.

01:17:26.791 --> 01:17:28.782
No wedding ring.

01:17:29.427 --> 01:17:33.229
Wait a minute. He didn't get married?

01:17:33.834 --> 01:17:35.462
Why?

01:17:37.441 --> 01:17:38.874
Me?

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.514
What did I do?

01:17:45.354 --> 01:17:47.255
You don't say much, do you?

01:18:36.803 --> 01:18:39.739
Looks like we're, uh, all here.

01:18:40.542 --> 01:18:42.637
Let's begin.

01:18:43.113 --> 01:18:46.346
Lord, we are gathered here today
to lay to rest Connor Mead.

01:18:47.821 --> 01:18:51.759
Connor Mead was a great man
and a great friend of the Church.

01:18:51.928 --> 01:18:55.831
- There's only one person at my funeral?
- That's the way it works, Dutch.

01:18:57.569 --> 01:18:59.732
Guys like us...

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.631
...we don't get the big funeral.

01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:05.981
I didn't expect big, Uncle Wayne,
but this is ridiculous.

01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:10.489
Yeah, I don't know how
to soften this one for you, Dutch. Uh...

01:19:11.692 --> 01:19:14.162
Nobody's really gonna miss you.

01:19:14.765 --> 01:19:19.260
Before the burial, would you like to say
a few words about the deceased?

01:19:30.489 --> 01:19:32.550
Connor Mead...

01:19:33.361 --> 01:19:35.489
...was a lot of things to a lot of people.

01:19:35.965 --> 01:19:38.230
Not all of them good things...

01:19:39.068 --> 01:19:41.698
...but to me he was a great brother.

01:19:44.645 --> 01:19:47.514
Guess it's just me against the world now.

01:19:47.683 --> 01:19:51.520
No, it's not, Paulie. No, it's not.
Look, it doesn't have to happen like this.

01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:55.129
- It's not gonna happen...
- Nothing you can do about it, Dutch.

01:19:55.563 --> 01:19:58.660
You made your bed, now you gotta bang
whatever crawls into it.

01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:02.033
That's what I keep trying to tell you.
What can I say?

01:20:02.207 --> 01:20:05.805
Life, you know,
it's like a quick cup of coffee.

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:08.779
You haven't got the guts
to love someone with all you got...

01:20:08.951 --> 01:20:11.649
...then you end up drinking alone.
- No. No, Uncle Wayne...

01:20:11.822 --> 01:20:14.315
- Sorry, kid. Party's over.
- Aah!

01:20:14.827 --> 01:20:17.093
- Ladies, let's take it away.
- Whoa.

01:20:17.264 --> 01:20:21.101
No! No! I can change! I swear!

01:20:21.272 --> 01:20:24.503
No! No!

01:20:24.675 --> 01:20:28.580
I can change! I swear! I can change! Aah!

01:20:34.492 --> 01:20:35.790
I'm alive.

01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:44.273
I'm alive!

01:20:44.741 --> 01:20:48.271
You there, young man. What day is it?

01:20:48.447 --> 01:20:49.540
Is it Christmas?

01:20:50.084 --> 01:20:53.578
No, it's Saturday, you moron.

01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:56.389
That's the day of my brother's wedding.

01:20:56.561 --> 01:20:59.397
All right, I haven't missed it, thank God.

01:20:59.567 --> 01:21:05.703
Let's get ready for nuptials!

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.652
Hey, hey, Paulie. Hey. Hey.

01:21:12.453 --> 01:21:15.652
- Did I miss the wedding?
- No. You got your wish.

01:21:15.825 --> 01:21:18.056
- Sandra called it off.
- What?

01:21:18.228 --> 01:21:20.027
- Why?
- Why do you think?

01:21:20.199 --> 01:21:22.192
- The thing I let slip about Donna?
- Yeah.

01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:25.397
No, no, no. You can't split up.

01:21:25.575 --> 01:21:28.101
You are meant
to spend the rest of your lives together.

01:21:28.279 --> 01:21:32.377
- You're gonna be miserable without her.
- You can be a real sarcastic prick.

01:21:32.552 --> 01:21:36.115
I am not being sarcastic, okay?
Where's Sandra?

01:21:36.292 --> 01:21:40.025
Sarge is taking her and the bridesmaids
to the airport. It's over.

01:21:40.198 --> 01:21:41.530
No.

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:43.761
No, no, no.

01:21:46.976 --> 01:21:48.444
Whoa.

01:21:59.896 --> 01:22:01.057
Sandra!

01:22:26.172 --> 01:22:27.265
What are you doing?

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:37.222
Whoo! Whoo!

01:22:39.694 --> 01:22:41.662
Aah! No seat belts!

01:22:46.972 --> 01:22:48.531
Sandra!

01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:51.137
Hey!

01:22:51.313 --> 01:22:54.409
Sandra, you're making a huge mistake!

01:22:55.519 --> 01:22:56.713
Was that Connor?

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:01.020
Sandra!

01:23:02.797 --> 01:23:03.822
Come on.

01:23:04.834 --> 01:23:05.859
Oh, shit.

01:23:15.519 --> 01:23:16.680
- Dad, stop!
- Aah!

01:23:17.388 --> 01:23:19.253
Sarge, stop.

01:23:19.423 --> 01:23:21.757
- Is that Connor?
- You could a killed us back there.

01:23:21.928 --> 01:23:24.193
- Sandra, lock the door. Get away.
- Sandra.

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:28.400
- Sarge, I need to talk to your daughter.
- Over my dead body, Paco.

01:23:28.873 --> 01:23:30.899
All right? Relax.

01:23:32.245 --> 01:23:33.406
Oh, my God.

01:23:33.581 --> 01:23:37.144
- I'm sorry, sir. I've come too far. Sandra.
- Sandra, stay in the car.

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.054
Did he just lock us...?

01:23:39.223 --> 01:23:41.419
- Don't you touch me.
- Now, you listen to me.

01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:43.796
Okay, first off:

01:23:44.198 --> 01:23:46.963
I am sorry about destroying
your wedding cake...

01:23:47.135 --> 01:23:51.165
...going to second base with your mother,
knocking your dad unconscious right there...

01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:54.310
...and basically
breaking up your wedding.

01:23:54.481 --> 01:23:58.317
I'm sorry.
That being said, I am begging you...

01:23:58.487 --> 01:24:01.184
...begging you, don't run away, all right?

01:24:01.358 --> 01:24:05.127
You and Paul have something so rare,
all right, so powerful.

01:24:05.298 --> 01:24:07.927
- Don't chicken out now.
- Chicken out? He cheated.

01:24:08.102 --> 01:24:09.468
Oh, get over it.

01:24:09.638 --> 01:24:13.441
It was years ago, all right?
With some slutty friend of yours.

01:24:13.612 --> 01:24:15.103
Yeah, well, that's true.

01:24:15.281 --> 01:24:17.911
A friend, incidentally,
who you're not even mad at.

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:21.319
And you know why?
Because you don't actually care.

01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:24.825
You love Paul so much,
you forgave him the second you heard.

01:24:24.996 --> 01:24:26.294
And that's what scares you.

01:24:26.466 --> 01:24:28.594
You have no idea how I feel.
You have no idea.

01:24:28.769 --> 01:24:32.469
Yes, I do. I've been in your shoes.

01:24:32.976 --> 01:24:35.172
You know what?
It scared the hell out of me too.

01:24:36.382 --> 01:24:40.219
What if she hurt me?
You know, what if she left me?

01:24:40.388 --> 01:24:42.517
What if she died?

01:24:42.992 --> 01:24:44.483
lt'd have been the end of me.

01:24:44.662 --> 01:24:49.602
So I cut it short, before she ever could.
And you know what?

01:24:49.770 --> 01:24:53.538
It was the biggest mistake
I have ever made.

01:24:53.709 --> 01:24:55.474
You're making that same mistake now...

01:24:55.646 --> 01:24:58.081
...and I'll be damned
if I'm gonna sit by and watch.

01:24:58.250 --> 01:25:01.051
You gotta risk love, Sandra. Risk it.

01:25:01.222 --> 01:25:08.222
I didn't. Look at me.
I'm an empty, lonely, ghost of a man.

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:12.395
It doesn't mean
that you're never gonna get hurt.

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:15.173
But I can guarantee you this:

01:25:15.345 --> 01:25:17.075
Any pain that you feel...

01:25:17.548 --> 01:25:22.455
...will never, ever compare to the regret
that comes from walking away from love.

01:25:23.491 --> 01:25:26.621
As someone who's felt a lot of both,
trust me.

01:25:26.796 --> 01:25:28.195
Pain...

01:25:29.633 --> 01:25:34.164
...beats regret every day of the week,
and twice on Sunday.

01:25:35.275 --> 01:25:37.074
Don't run away.

01:25:37.246 --> 01:25:39.182
Don't do it.

01:25:43.256 --> 01:25:45.658
I can't believe I'm saying this...

01:25:46.795 --> 01:25:49.027
...but, uh, I think you might be right.

01:25:50.667 --> 01:25:52.066
So...

01:25:53.606 --> 01:25:54.972
...you wanna get married?

01:25:57.412 --> 01:25:59.541
- I do.
- You do?

01:25:59.716 --> 01:26:01.777
- Yeah, I do.
- You do?

01:26:02.553 --> 01:26:03.919
Yes.

01:26:04.090 --> 01:26:05.422
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:09.730
Whoo!

01:26:17.077 --> 01:26:19.046
Oh, baby.

01:26:21.517 --> 01:26:25.616
Flowers, check. Cake, check.
Dinner, check.

01:26:25.791 --> 01:26:29.855
- Photographer?
- Ooh, I know a pretty good photographer.

01:26:49.162 --> 01:26:50.529
Shall we begin?

01:26:50.699 --> 01:26:54.228
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are here to witness the union...

01:26:54.404 --> 01:26:58.501
...of Sandra Marie Volcom and Paul Mead.

01:26:59.311 --> 01:27:01.304
<i>At them.</i>

01:27:08.426 --> 01:27:12.763
It was cold and dark.
We'd been taking fire for hours.

01:27:13.235 --> 01:27:15.465
We took an incoming mortar hit.

01:27:15.639 --> 01:27:18.871
I opened up his jacket
and his insides fell out...

01:27:19.043 --> 01:27:21.946
...and I had his bloody guts in my hand.

01:27:22.448 --> 01:27:25.351
They were warm and mushy and squishy.

01:27:26.355 --> 01:27:28.825
And I pushed them right back
into his body cavity...

01:27:28.993 --> 01:27:32.158
...and willed him to live with my tears.

01:27:32.332 --> 01:27:35.064
And that is what true love is.

01:27:35.370 --> 01:27:36.735
Hua!

01:27:40.344 --> 01:27:41.835
I've heard that story a hundred times.

01:27:44.484 --> 01:27:45.975
Um...

01:27:46.387 --> 01:27:50.986
I guess now's as good a time as any
for me to make my best man's toast.

01:27:51.162 --> 01:27:56.399
I've never given one of these before,
so, uh, bear with me.

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:59.507
Someone once told me...

01:27:59.676 --> 01:28:03.841
...that the power in all relationships
lies with whoever cares less.

01:28:04.383 --> 01:28:06.215
And he was right.

01:28:06.386 --> 01:28:08.617
But power isn't happiness.

01:28:08.789 --> 01:28:10.258
And...

01:28:10.426 --> 01:28:12.794
...I think that maybe happiness comes...

01:28:12.964 --> 01:28:18.405
...from caring more about people,
rather than less.

01:28:18.573 --> 01:28:23.878
And nobody proves that better
than my kid brother, Paulie.

01:28:24.048 --> 01:28:28.454
Buddy, you give love to everyone...

01:28:28.622 --> 01:28:30.921
...and you require none in return.

01:28:31.493 --> 01:28:36.833
From this day on,
I wanna be more like you.

01:28:37.569 --> 01:28:39.937
I want you to be proud of me again.

01:28:40.442 --> 01:28:41.932
Yeah.

01:28:44.214 --> 01:28:46.240
And here's to my new sister.

01:28:47.017 --> 01:28:50.512
You know, Sandra, all I can really say...

01:28:50.691 --> 01:28:54.323
...all that I know for sure...

01:28:55.365 --> 01:28:57.267
...is that Mom and Dad...

01:28:58.837 --> 01:29:00.807
...they would've loved you.

01:29:01.342 --> 01:29:04.074
And I'm glad you're part of our family.

01:29:04.814 --> 01:29:07.375
- Here's to Paul and Sandra, right here.
- Yeah, to Paul and Sandra.

01:29:20.038 --> 01:29:22.270
Look here. Look right here.

01:29:22.442 --> 01:29:24.035
Okay. And how old are you?

01:29:25.748 --> 01:29:27.944
Who's in the middle? Look over here.

01:29:28.118 --> 01:29:30.952
All right. Go dance, drink eggnog.

01:29:31.122 --> 01:29:33.115
- Hey, sexy cameraman.
- Hey, ladies.

01:29:33.292 --> 01:29:36.195
- Connor, we're really worried about you.
- Need we remind you...

01:29:36.364 --> 01:29:40.064
...as man-whore in residence, you have
certain duties to the single ladies here?

01:29:40.238 --> 01:29:44.176
That is very tempting, ladies, it is.

01:29:45.179 --> 01:29:47.171
- But, uh, I'm out.
- No.

01:29:47.616 --> 01:29:50.017
Ladies, thank you, but no thank you.
Hmm?

01:29:50.186 --> 01:29:54.125
Hey, hard-to-get only works
if you eventually give in.

01:29:54.927 --> 01:29:56.487
One more time.

01:29:56.664 --> 01:29:59.600
- Hey.
- Good night.

01:30:23.908 --> 01:30:27.402
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

01:30:27.581 --> 01:30:30.575
You did it.
You pulled off a great wedding.

01:30:31.119 --> 01:30:32.985
We pulled off a great wedding.

01:30:33.423 --> 01:30:36.758
Of course, if I wouldn't have broken it,
it wouldn't have needed fixing.

01:30:36.928 --> 01:30:39.524
- True, true, true.
- Ha, ha.

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:43.839
- Okay, I have to know.
- Mm.

01:30:45.076 --> 01:30:47.102
What happened to you last night?

01:30:47.279 --> 01:30:51.116
Because yesterday, you were just
your usual handsome, awful self.

01:30:51.286 --> 01:30:54.313
But then today,
you became the guy I used to know.

01:30:55.125 --> 01:31:00.190
The one I always thought, deep down,
you actually were.

01:31:00.366 --> 01:31:03.860
I honestly don't know
what the hell happened to me last night.

01:31:04.038 --> 01:31:08.844
I don't. But I do know that
I'm seeing things more clearly today...

01:31:09.015 --> 01:31:11.280
...than any time that I can remember.

01:31:11.451 --> 01:31:13.352
Like the way I feel about you.

01:31:15.524 --> 01:31:17.993
That's something that has never changed.

01:31:20.966 --> 01:31:23.094
I wish I could believe you.

01:31:24.539 --> 01:31:27.236
We've just been through this before...

01:31:28.845 --> 01:31:33.410
...so how do I know it's not just
another line from the Mead-family playbook?

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:35.722
Hmm.

01:31:48.243 --> 01:31:50.075
You remember her?

01:31:55.556 --> 01:31:57.320
You kept it.

01:31:58.727 --> 01:32:00.390
Yeah.

01:32:00.930 --> 01:32:03.902
I've had that on me
since the day I took it.

01:32:05.371 --> 01:32:06.896
I can't believe it.

01:32:08.477 --> 01:32:10.707
Give me one more chance.

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:12.974
I'll do better.

01:32:13.451 --> 01:32:17.891
Whatever it takes.
The wooing, the spooning, I am all in.

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:20.622
Even massages with our clothes on?

01:32:22.098 --> 01:32:23.930
No. No, that's where I draw the line.

01:32:24.101 --> 01:32:25.967
- Well?
- No massages with clothes on.

01:32:26.137 --> 01:32:28.164
Not a chance.

01:32:28.642 --> 01:32:31.044
I promise you this:

01:32:31.447 --> 01:32:33.575
When you wake up in the morning...

01:32:36.055 --> 01:32:37.579
...l'll be there.

01:32:38.324 --> 01:32:40.088
Every time.

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:05.959
What?

01:33:06.268 --> 01:33:07.827
What is it?

01:33:08.372 --> 01:33:09.465
Ha, ha. Nothing.

01:33:11.811 --> 01:33:13.541
I just recognize this song.

01:33:15.417 --> 01:33:17.249
Oh, yeah.

01:33:19.124 --> 01:33:22.152
- May I have this dance?
- Finally.

01:33:22.329 --> 01:33:25.790
- Pete Hastings, eat your heart out.
- Ha, ha.

01:33:28.838 --> 01:33:31.536
That's how it's done, Dutch.

01:33:31.711 --> 01:33:34.180
That's how it's done.

01:33:35.416 --> 01:33:40.322
Well, work's over. What do you say, doll?
Let's get naked.

01:33:41.426 --> 01:33:43.087
Mm.

01:33:43.262 --> 01:33:46.496
Dry. I love it.

01:33:47.303 --> 01:33:49.965
You know, I'm interviewing
for a new secretary.

01:33:50.139 --> 01:33:53.111
- Mm?
- How good is your dictation?

01:33:53.279 --> 01:33:55.646
You get it? "Dick-tation"?

01:33:55.816 --> 01:34:00.279
Please, I'm actually at this party.

01:34:13.444 --> 01:34:15.072
Hi.

01:34:23.126 --> 01:34:26.097
Looks like it's just you and me, sweetie.

01:34:26.832 --> 01:34:29.962
Oh, I love those scrunchies.

01:34:30.873 --> 01:34:32.774
Ew, ha, ha.

01:34:32.942 --> 01:34:35.036
I'm, like, 16.

01:34:35.212 --> 01:34:39.344
We're ghosts, baby. We're ageless.

01:34:56.980 --> 01:35:01.147
Okay, Connor Mead's out. Who's next?

01:35:01.321 --> 01:35:02.880
Paul's desperate work friends?

01:35:03.892 --> 01:35:06.259
- Yeah. I'm back to you.
- I think I'm loosening up.

01:35:06.931 --> 01:35:09.025
- Let's do this thing.
- Yeah, all right.

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:11.362
- Okay, I get the little one.
- You can have him.

01:35:11.537 --> 01:35:15.169
- Okay.
- I said, I get the little one.

01:35:15.345 --> 01:35:17.278
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:35:17.446 --> 01:35:21.318
- You're so cute.
- You look just like my sister. Why would l...?

01:35:23.089 --> 01:35:24.751
Mind if I cut in?

01:35:34.642 --> 01:35:37.306
You know, it makes me happy.

01:35:40.551 --> 01:35:42.817
You did a wonderful job with her, Von.

01:35:42.989 --> 01:35:45.652
So did you, Mervis.

01:35:47.863 --> 01:35:51.460
You repeat that name to anyone,
you're a dead man.

01:35:59.316 --> 01:36:01.647
- Sandy, right here.
- No, no.

01:36:10.066 --> 01:36:11.727
Kako.

01:36:16.509 --> 01:36:18.536
Yes.

01:40:33.690 --> 01:40:35.488
<i>What...? What did...?</i>
