WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.159
Black on white actually
run in the family?

00:03.235 --> 00:04.965
You leave my sister
alone. You got one of ours.

00:05.038 --> 00:07.802
Why shouldn't we get one of
yours, you know what I mean?

00:08.441 --> 00:10.068
Chris Kennedy.
Lyla Garrity.

00:10.143 --> 00:12.304
You are an
interesting girl.

00:12.379 --> 00:13.471
Thanks.

00:14.981 --> 00:16.608
You make me feel
too much, Landry.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.173
...is just a little time
to think about things.

00:18.251 --> 00:20.549
I can't just keep waiting around
until you finally realize it.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.282
I can't. I don't know what
else to do. Good night.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.153
<i>What are we gonna do
about the house, Billy?</i>

00:25.225 --> 00:27.750
We got to come up
with $2,000 in two weeks.

00:27.827 --> 00:29.317
Get your crap and
let's get out of here.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.296
What are you doing?
Come on. Tim.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.490
It's our mortgage.

00:32.564 --> 00:35.261
We just stole $3,000 from one of
the biggest drug dealers in Dillon.

00:42.809 --> 00:44.276
I do not need
a new transmission.

00:44.344 --> 00:46.574
Hold on,
just let the man talk.

00:46.646 --> 00:49.308
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, gentlemen.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.679
The transmission's shot.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.446
I'm gonna have to pull the
housing off, reset the flywheel,

00:53.520 --> 00:56.011
and while I'm in there, I might as
well drop in a new throw out bearing.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.250
Oh, why not? Why not? You're throwing
the rest of the damn car away.

00:58.324 --> 00:59.848
How much is
this gonna cost?

01:00.260 --> 01:01.557
Four or five grand.

01:01.628 --> 01:03.789
Dear God Almighty, does that at
least come with an orgasm or what?

01:03.863 --> 01:06.331
We'll know better once we get in there
and see what all's wrong with it...

01:06.399 --> 01:07.957
Four grand? This car's
not even worth four grand.

01:08.034 --> 01:09.296
You're talking about old
Bessy. I think she might...

01:09.369 --> 01:11.132
You told me she was in tip-top
shape when you sold it to me.

01:11.204 --> 01:12.296
Well, I know her 'cause...

01:12.372 --> 01:15.364
I told you years ago that if you
didn't take better care of old Bessy

01:15.442 --> 01:17.433
and rebuild old Bessy's transmission,
that this was gonna happen.

01:17.510 --> 01:19.102
What? Years ago? Years ago?
You knew about this?

01:19.179 --> 01:20.407
What? I don't think
we should be talking...

01:20.480 --> 01:21.947
You looked me in
the eyes and said...

01:22.015 --> 01:24.677
Buddy! Buddy,
can you get in here!

01:27.020 --> 01:29.818
Hey, hey! Jason!
Hey, Herc!

01:29.889 --> 01:31.220
Hey, guys,
come on.

01:32.125 --> 01:35.117
God dang, Jason, I have
never seen you act like that.

01:35.195 --> 01:36.423
What's wrong
with you, son?

01:36.496 --> 01:37.929
I'm sorry, Mr. Garrity,
it's just that...

01:37.997 --> 01:39.931
That guy,
he sold me a bad truck.

01:39.999 --> 01:43.162
He sold me a bad truck and now it's
gonna cost me $4,000 to get it fixed.

01:43.236 --> 01:45.329
You know how much money
I have to my name?

01:45.405 --> 01:46.872
No, I do not.

01:47.540 --> 01:48.632
$8,000.

01:48.708 --> 01:50.699
8,000, that's half my money.

01:52.345 --> 01:57.044
Well, Jason, maybe
you're just gonna...

01:57.617 --> 02:00.085
You're just gonna have to
do without a car for a while.

02:00.153 --> 02:03.054
Mr. Garrity, you... Listen, you don't
understand what it's like to have to

02:03.123 --> 02:06.388
rely on people to get you around all
over town, to have rides everywhere.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.050
I don't even fit in most of
my friends' cars, you know?

02:08.127 --> 02:09.459
It's just...
At the end of the day,

02:09.529 --> 02:12.327
I'm just gonna have to pay for this truck
and hopefully I won't run out of money

02:12.398 --> 02:14.889
anytime after that and then have
to move back in with my parents.

02:21.174 --> 02:22.471
Jason,

02:26.146 --> 02:28.046
you ever thought
about selling cars?

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.124 --> 02:40.888
Well, lookie here.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.222
Timmy Boy Riggins.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.622
What's going on, man?

02:47.400 --> 02:48.628
What's going down?

02:48.701 --> 02:51.966
Not much, you know,
just doing my thing, I guess.

02:52.038 --> 02:55.007
You don't come around very
often anymore. Ferrets miss you.

02:55.074 --> 02:56.871
Right.
They're depressed.

02:56.943 --> 03:01.141
Anyways, the boys and I
are fixing to go hunting.

03:01.548 --> 03:02.742
Grab some beer
and come with us?

03:02.815 --> 03:04.612
Actually, I got to take
care of some stuff, so...

03:04.684 --> 03:06.117
Yeah.
Yeah.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.881
Got to do what
you got to do, huh?

03:07.954 --> 03:08.978
All right, man.

03:09.055 --> 03:10.920
Yeah. All right, you guys
have a good day, all right?

03:10.990 --> 03:12.218
Listen, Tim.

03:13.459 --> 03:17.259
Hold on, man.
I miss you, you know?

03:17.630 --> 03:19.461
I'm worried about you.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.262
Worried you might get
in with the wrong people.

03:22.335 --> 03:23.802
Do something stupid.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.303
Yeah.
Yeah.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.572
That's alcohol abuse.

03:29.642 --> 03:32.440
Now, why don't you tell me
where the hell my money is?

03:35.381 --> 03:36.507
How'd that taste?

03:36.583 --> 03:39.279
You've got till the end
of the week, pretty boy.

03:39.752 --> 03:41.652
Or I'll shoot
your knees off.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.488
Let's go.

03:46.492 --> 03:48.392
Good luck at
the game on Friday.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.168
Yes?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.711
Ma'am, is Brian Williams
your son?

04:05.778 --> 04:08.178
Yes, he is.
Can I help you?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.875
We have a warrant
for his arrest, ma'am.

04:09.949 --> 04:11.382
An arrest warrant?
For what?

04:11.451 --> 04:12.509
On assault charges.

04:12.585 --> 04:13.745
Brian!
I need you to step out.

04:13.820 --> 04:14.946
What? Wait a minute.
Brian Williams?

04:15.021 --> 04:16.545
Sorry, Mama.
Step on out.

04:16.623 --> 04:18.317
What's going on here?

04:18.391 --> 04:19.688
An arrest warrant for what?
Come on out.

04:19.759 --> 04:20.952
Something happened last week.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.927
Look, I can't tell you now,
but it's gonna be okay.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.224
Did he
just say assault?

04:24.297 --> 04:25.696
I can't tell you.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.630
Well, you don't have to
put no handcuffs on him!

04:27.700 --> 04:29.395
Wait, you all didn't serve
no papers or nothing!

04:29.469 --> 04:32.438
You all just gonna take him
away? What's going on here?

04:33.606 --> 04:35.073
Watch your head.

04:35.975 --> 04:39.172
I don't understand! Brian!

05:26.459 --> 05:29.360
I need someone else to come out there
and coach that damn volleyball team.

05:29.429 --> 05:30.453
TAMl: Sure.

05:30.530 --> 05:31.963
Coach Peema up and leaves
right in the middle.

05:32.031 --> 05:33.521
Right in the middle
of the season.

05:33.599 --> 05:35.328
Terrible. Terrible.
She up and leaves.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.062
Can't be you though,
that's for sure.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.070
Even if you are
athletic director.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.504
TAMl: Can you butter some toast
there for me, babe? Thank you.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.269
I'd love to butter
you some toast.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.674
Thank you, sweetheart.

05:46.879 --> 05:50.315
Well, why... Honey, why are
you looking at me like that?

05:50.383 --> 05:52.408
You know I can't do it.
I don't have time.

05:52.485 --> 05:55.545
Listen to me. You used to play
varsity volleyball. You know the sport.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.179
Well, sweetheart,
that is irrelevant.

05:57.256 --> 06:00.521
Did you not just say to me
that you want more exercise?

06:00.593 --> 06:02.584
But, sweetie, I'm overextended.
I've got Gracie Belle...

06:02.662 --> 06:04.687
Yes.
Well, there you go.

06:04.764 --> 06:06.698
You'd get to work with the
girls, you'd get the exercise.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.700
Let me tell you something about these
girls, they've got lots of spunk.

06:08.768 --> 06:11.032
Dad, they're zero
and seven this year.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.196
They're failing miserably.

06:12.271 --> 06:14.000
They're rebuilding. You be
quiet and eat your breakfast.

06:14.073 --> 06:15.131
Yeah,
0 and seven is rebuilding.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.267
TAMl: Challenge at best.
Listen, it is three weeks.

06:17.343 --> 06:19.834
Period. Four at most. Hello?

06:20.880 --> 06:25.078
When?
Yeah, I'll be down there.

06:25.985 --> 06:28.749
All right, thanks, Bill.
All right. Yeah. All right.

06:29.622 --> 06:30.714
What's up?

06:32.258 --> 06:33.691
What's going on? I got to
go to the police station.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.091
Smash is down there.
What?

06:35.161 --> 06:37.220
I don't know any more.
I'll see you in a little.

06:37.296 --> 06:39.992
Hey, and thank you.
You're a good woman.

06:57.683 --> 07:01.847
You'll all know this is one of the finest
quarterbacks we've ever had here in Dillon.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.752
And he's gonna be
a fine sales associate.

07:03.823 --> 07:08.192
Welcome him to our team. I want
you all to treat him like family,

07:08.261 --> 07:11.094
teach him the ropes. Have a
good day, Jason. It'll be good.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.155
Thank you, Mr. Garrity.
All right.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.326
First off, I just...

07:16.402 --> 07:18.393
Can you believe this? We're
not selling any cars as it is.

07:18.471 --> 07:20.735
Now we got competition
in a wheelchair.

07:20.807 --> 07:23.537
That's just great.
That's great for my mortgage.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.746
He couldn't
have done this.

07:32.518 --> 07:34.110
Tell me you
did not do this.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.655
Mama, I told you, he was
talking smack to Noannie.

07:36.722 --> 07:38.053
What? I'm supposed
to let it happen?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.853
You're supposed
to walk away.

07:39.926 --> 07:42.588
I done told you a million times you
got to be better than other people.

07:42.662 --> 07:44.493
Let me lay out
your options.

07:44.897 --> 07:48.890
If we make a case that Brian felt
threatened and was defending himself,

07:48.968 --> 07:50.868
could lead
to a messy trial.

07:50.937 --> 07:54.805
If he is found guilty, it's likely
a judge will throw the book at him.

07:54.874 --> 07:59.038
On the other hand, given that
the injuries weren't too severe

07:59.111 --> 08:00.874
and Smash is
a respected athlete,

08:00.947 --> 08:03.245
I'm pretty sure I can get
the ADA to cut a deal.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.546
A deal?
What kind of deal?

08:05.618 --> 08:08.485
Well, he pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor, then we'll go...

08:08.554 --> 08:10.579
No. No, hell no.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.850
Listen to this man now.

08:11.924 --> 08:13.016
I don't need
to listen to...

08:13.092 --> 08:14.684
Listen to your mother.
Would you, please?

08:14.760 --> 08:17.888
Now look here, I'm not gonna sit up
here and let you throw away everything

08:17.964 --> 08:20.762
because of your big,
ignorant ego. Do you hear me?

08:21.234 --> 08:24.260
And if making a deal
makes this thing go away,

08:24.337 --> 08:27.033
we're gonna listen to
what this man has to say.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.333
Now please, go on.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.405
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

08:34.847 --> 08:36.644
I appreciate you taking
the time to allow me to speak

08:36.716 --> 08:39.947
on the altercation I had last
week involving two white teenagers.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.145
I struck someone,
which I shouldn't have done.

08:44.824 --> 08:47.759
And I want to apologize to
him and everyone for doing so.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.591
I also want to make it clear
that I've learned from my mistakes

08:50.663 --> 08:52.358
and assure you all that
it will not happen again.

08:52.431 --> 08:54.831
One witness said he insulted the girl
you were with. Is that true, Smash?

08:54.901 --> 08:56.562
Coach, how's your team
feel about this?

08:56.636 --> 08:58.501
Just a couple more
questions here, please.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.602
With a container
of one liter,

09:01.674 --> 09:06.008
S is three squared centimeters,
L is five. That gives us...

09:06.078 --> 09:09.206
The frequency
would be 130 hertz.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.011
Hundred thirty.

09:11.083 --> 09:14.211
Landry Clarke.
Just the man I need to see.

09:14.654 --> 09:16.622
Hey, Tyra. Long time no see. Hi.

09:16.689 --> 09:17.713
Um...

09:18.558 --> 09:19.957
Hi, I'm Jean.

09:20.026 --> 09:21.755
This is Jean.
I'm sorry, this is Jean.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.590
This is Tyra.
Tyra, this is Jean.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.494
Old buddy of mine.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.932
So, biology quiz. So I'm supposed to
know about, like, this rat experiment

09:29.001 --> 09:31.834
that says fewer calories lead to a
longer life or something like that.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.464
It's actually
a trick question.

09:34.540 --> 09:38.874
The rats that died sooner
were fed more sugar and yeast.

09:38.945 --> 09:42.403
So it's sort of a question of dietary
restriction more than anything else.

09:42.481 --> 09:44.745
Yeah, it... Dietary
restriction. Thanks, Landry.

09:44.817 --> 09:46.409
Appreciate that.

09:47.286 --> 09:50.084
I'm gonna get a Coke.
You want anything?

09:50.156 --> 09:51.953
Yeah, I'm okay.

09:52.024 --> 09:55.152
Okay. Great.
It was nice meeting you.

09:55.227 --> 09:56.489
Bye.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.190
She's got
cool hair, huh?

09:58.264 --> 10:02.394
So, using your tutoring skills to
seduce freshman now? Is that it?

10:04.103 --> 10:05.798
That's funny. No.
It's not, actually...

10:05.871 --> 10:07.532
We actually we got paired
up for a physics project,

10:07.607 --> 10:08.835
so this is kind
of mandatory...

10:08.908 --> 10:10.398
Wait, she's in your
physics class?

10:10.476 --> 10:11.738
She looks like
she's twelve.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.644
She's not twelve. She may have skipped
a grade or two, but she's not...

10:14.714 --> 10:16.511
Oh, well,
good luck with that.

10:16.582 --> 10:17.947
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah.

10:18.985 --> 10:22.944
<i>Hallelujah, praise thy name</i>

10:23.022 --> 10:25.957
<i>For falling down on me</i>

10:27.059 --> 10:30.426
<i>Hallelujah, all my days</i>

10:30.830 --> 10:33.196
<i>Just the drums
and the voices sing.</i>

10:33.265 --> 10:34.823
<i>Hallelujah</i>

10:34.900 --> 10:38.336
<i>Hallelujah, praise thy name</i>

10:38.404 --> 10:40.497
<i>The only way</i>

10:41.207 --> 10:43.767
<i>to really heal
the ravages of sin</i>

10:44.844 --> 10:48.211
<i>is to put our
trust in the Lord.</i>

10:48.280 --> 10:49.679
Amen.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.741
<i>Give our hearts
over to him.</i>

10:53.953 --> 10:59.391
<i>And if we do, miracles
will come into our lives.</i>

10:59.825 --> 11:01.224
Yeah!

11:01.560 --> 11:03.755
<i>Do you feel the Lord
in your hearts?</i>

11:04.397 --> 11:05.955
<i>Do you feel him?</i>

11:06.032 --> 11:09.024
<i>Do you feel it? Do you feel
the Lord in your hearts?</i>

11:09.101 --> 11:12.969
<i>Do you feel alive? Do you feel
that a friend has come here tonight?</i>

11:13.539 --> 11:15.439
<i>I am a friend of God!</i>

11:16.242 --> 11:18.073
<i>Hey.
I am a friend of yours.</i>

11:18.144 --> 11:19.736
I got to talk to you, Lyla.
Tim, what are you doing here?

11:19.812 --> 11:21.211
I got to talk to you,
that's why I'm here.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.907
This is not the place.
What happened to your face?

11:22.982 --> 11:25.041
I got beat up by three
meth addicts yesterday.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.379
That's what
happened to my face.

11:26.452 --> 11:28.147
What? Why did you get beat
up by three meth addicts?

11:28.988 --> 11:30.819
Because I stole $3,000,
that's why.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.949
Why would you steal $3,000
from meth addicts?

11:33.025 --> 11:34.720
It's not important
right now.

11:34.794 --> 11:35.988
What's important is
I want to talk you.

11:36.062 --> 11:37.154
Tim, I think you
should leave.

11:37.229 --> 11:38.457
Come to my place tomorrow
night so we can talk.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.589
Come? I'm not coming
to your place.

11:39.665 --> 11:40.689
Yes.
No.

11:40.766 --> 11:43.701
<i>...is to put our
trust in the Lord.</i>

11:43.769 --> 11:45.600
I have something important
to tell you. Stop it.

11:45.671 --> 11:47.730
Tim, I'm not coming
to your place. Please go.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.274
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

11:49.675 --> 11:51.040
Say yes and I'll leave.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.134
Fine.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.872
Fine, I'll come
to your place.

11:55.081 --> 11:57.515
For sure? Tell me you're
coming and I'm gone.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.016
I'm coming.

12:00.052 --> 12:04.421
<i>It's amazing
Who am I?</i>

12:04.490 --> 12:09.325
<i>Who am I that you are
mine who will love me</i>

12:09.395 --> 12:12.831
<i>That you keep me
That you hear me</i>

12:14.166 --> 12:16.100
<i>When I call</i>

12:23.142 --> 12:27.511
TAMl: Not bad.
Okay.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.946
Watch out!

12:31.016 --> 12:33.450
Okay. Good start.

12:33.953 --> 12:35.352
Heads up!

12:35.421 --> 12:37.548
Over the net!
TAMl: Tim!

12:37.623 --> 12:39.181
Thanks, just pick up
the balls.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.886
You're here to help
not to coach.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.552
Oh, sweetie.

12:44.630 --> 12:49.124
Now let's try to see if we can get one
back this time, y'all. Talk to each other.

12:55.808 --> 12:57.139
Talk to each other.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.540
Not mine, not mine!

13:01.147 --> 13:03.115
Well, I didn't hear
a thing that time!

13:03.182 --> 13:05.946
Talk to each other!
Focus and I want to hear you!

13:06.786 --> 13:08.515
So, the engine
has 217 horsepower

13:08.587 --> 13:10.214
and 217 pound-foot
of torque.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.847
The interior's pretty,
pretty roomy.

13:11.924 --> 13:14.688
Plus the UltraLux seating will
keep you warm in the winter

13:14.760 --> 13:16.318
and cool in the summertime.

13:16.395 --> 13:17.862
We're sold, man.
Excellent.

13:17.930 --> 13:21.457
You have the dual front stage air
bags. You have the head-curtain...

13:21.534 --> 13:24.230
I don't think you understand. We
actually want to buy the car right now.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.066
We've made up our mind. All right.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.266
<i>Jason Street, please report to the
sales lounge. Jason to the lounge.</i>

13:29.341 --> 13:30.968
Okay. That's me.
Make sure you...

13:31.043 --> 13:34.638
Make sure you are in love with the car,
then we'll start the paperwork, okay?

13:34.713 --> 13:35.771
Hi.

13:37.716 --> 13:39.809
Thank you.
What do you need?

13:40.452 --> 13:41.646
What do you think
you're doing?

13:41.720 --> 13:44.587
Oh, I'm selling a car.
They wanna buy that car.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.991
That's great.
That's great.

13:47.059 --> 13:50.893
We have rules around here that we
all follow, starting with the point.

13:51.931 --> 13:53.364
The point system?
Point?

13:53.432 --> 13:54.490
The point system, okay.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.900
The point system says, the higher your
sales figures the higher you are in rotation.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.301
Okay.
If you're number one,

13:59.371 --> 14:03.205
as I am, it means you get the first customer
through the door at the top of every hour.

14:03.275 --> 14:04.367
Right. Okay.

14:04.443 --> 14:06.638
Second on the list get
the next and so on. Okay.

14:06.712 --> 14:08.805
Got it? Yeah. Nobody told me yesterday.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.140
That's okay.

14:11.217 --> 14:12.707
You're new,
you're forgiven.

14:12.785 --> 14:13.877
Okay. Well, thank you.

14:13.953 --> 14:15.147
Just check with me
next time, okay?

14:15.221 --> 14:16.950
Okay. Sure thing.
Will do.

14:17.723 --> 14:19.054
How do I look?

14:19.525 --> 14:20.787
Great.

14:21.126 --> 14:22.491
You know it.

14:23.996 --> 14:27.193
Hi. Hear we
got a new Malibu owner.

14:28.934 --> 14:31.300
So, have you heard
of this girl Jane?

14:31.370 --> 14:33.964
She's in
Landry's physics class.

14:34.039 --> 14:37.634
She has blonde dreads,
glasses, short.

14:37.710 --> 14:41.146
There's a girl Jean. She's in my
geometry class with the pink hair.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.805
She's...

14:42.882 --> 14:44.474
She's interesting,
to say the least.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.916
She's... I mean,
she's a brainiac.

14:46.986 --> 14:50.820
A.P. Classes. Into like cult movies
and music and stuff like that.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.187
How was
coaching today, honey?

14:52.258 --> 14:54.192
Oh, it was so
great, honey.

14:54.260 --> 14:57.718
Those girls are so spunky, some of them
don't even know the rules of the game.

14:57.796 --> 14:59.764
First day of coaching, it's
always a reality check, sweetheart.

14:59.832 --> 15:03.393
You did not give full disclosure
on that one and that is for sure.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.198
Hey, can you girls put
those chips away, please?

15:05.271 --> 15:07.205
We're having
dinner right now.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.932
Where do they go?

15:09.008 --> 15:10.305
Above the fridge.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.344
Can you put that
on the table, sweetie?

15:21.453 --> 15:24.650
This casserole
is something else.

15:24.723 --> 15:26.054
Thank you, sweetie.

15:27.359 --> 15:29.384
You know, I never realized
you were so tall.

15:29.461 --> 15:31.088
5' 11".

15:31.163 --> 15:32.528
TAMl: How about that?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.190
You're a tall
drink of water.

15:36.001 --> 15:37.969
You know what that'd be
great for? Volleyball.

15:38.037 --> 15:39.265
Mom, drop it.

15:39.338 --> 15:40.703
TAMl: Have you ever
thought about that?

15:40.773 --> 15:42.206
I mean, it'd be great for
your college apps, sweetie.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.332
Oh, no.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.036
No.
Really?

15:45.110 --> 15:46.737
I'm gonna watch this game.
Oh, okay, sweetie.

15:46.812 --> 15:48.211
Thanks. You bet.
Enjoy that.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.373
You know, and the colleges, when
they look at the applications,

15:50.449 --> 15:51.939
they look at, sort of,
the big picture,

15:52.017 --> 15:55.544
which is why the sports would be
a great addition to that for you.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.146
She came over for dinner, Mom, not
to get lectured about volleyball.

15:58.223 --> 16:01.192
The thing that I love about athletics,
it's mind-body-spirit, you know?

16:01.260 --> 16:04.696
And I look at you and I see that that
would be something real good for you.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.628
You look at me
and you see a spiker.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.065
Well, I do look at you
and I see a spiker.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.364
Do you know what I see?
I see a kick-ass spiker.

16:11.437 --> 16:12.802
Nothing wrong
with that.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.862
Mrs. T., why can't you just be
honest and just ask me for a favor?

16:14.940 --> 16:16.430
Which is what you're
getting at right now.

16:18.110 --> 16:22.342
Well, you know what? It would be a
favor to me. It would be a favor to me.

16:23.048 --> 16:25.243
And certainly not that you
owe me anything, Tyra,

16:25.317 --> 16:28.115
but, you know, I think it
would also be very good for you.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.228
So what are you doing? You
want to get together later?

16:37.296 --> 16:38.957
Grab a movie?

16:39.298 --> 16:40.788
Dinner? Something?
Yeah, I...

16:40.866 --> 16:43.027
Hang out?
I'd love to,

16:43.102 --> 16:45.798
but I told my mom I'd
babysit Buddy, Jr.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.536
Everything okay?

16:48.440 --> 16:50.965
Yeah, yeah,
everything's fine.

16:51.543 --> 16:52.669
Okay.

16:54.613 --> 16:55.773
I'll call you later.

16:55.848 --> 16:56.872
Okay.

17:12.464 --> 17:13.829
Hey.
Hi.

17:13.898 --> 17:15.025
How you doing?

17:15.099 --> 17:16.328
I'm okay,
how are you?

17:16.402 --> 17:18.426
I'm all right.
Come on in.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.835
Okay.

17:23.642 --> 17:27.942
I... Oh, sit down. I made some chicken.

17:29.014 --> 17:31.073
You what?
I made some chicken.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.845
Like really good.
Oh, no, no, no, Tim.

17:32.918 --> 17:35.113
No, seriously. Just, no, just... No.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.546
Just sit down, please.

17:38.424 --> 17:40.483
This isn't me, I'm sorry.

17:41.293 --> 17:43.022
These candles,
I don't even...

17:43.562 --> 17:45.359
I don't even know
what that was.

17:45.931 --> 17:48.593
I just got to get something
off my chest, Garrity.

17:49.368 --> 17:51.598
No, I don't think that's a
good idea. I need to go home.

17:51.670 --> 17:52.830
Hey.

17:54.039 --> 17:55.836
Seriously. Wait.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.672
Wait. What? Don't...

18:00.446 --> 18:01.743
Garrity,

18:01.814 --> 18:03.679
I love you.
What?

18:03.749 --> 18:04.875
I love you.

18:07.219 --> 18:09.050
How am I supposed
to react to that?

18:11.023 --> 18:12.285
Brutal honesty.

18:16.728 --> 18:17.888
Please.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.166
It's never gonna happen.

18:23.669 --> 18:24.966
What is this?
Because of...

18:25.037 --> 18:26.095
I feel like
I have to go.

18:26.171 --> 18:27.729
The Christiansen guy?
No.

18:27.806 --> 18:32.072
Or what? You can't tell me that you
share whatever we had with this guy.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.704
You can't tell me that he knows
everything I know about you.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.111
You can't tell me that.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.515
I don't believe you.

18:38.584 --> 18:41.212
Be honest with yourself
for two seconds,

18:41.286 --> 18:44.687
and look me in the eye and tell me that
you don't feel the way I feel about you,

18:44.756 --> 18:46.348
and then I'll move on.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.021
I don't feel the way
you feel about me.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.028
Move on.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.983
Beautiful!

19:15.053 --> 19:17.453
That's what I'm
talking about. See?

19:17.523 --> 19:19.423
Told you, you could
do this, Tyra.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.083
There you go!

19:21.160 --> 19:23.060
Let's get a smile on
that face. You having fun?

19:23.128 --> 19:24.322
No.

19:24.396 --> 19:28.162
Start having... Uh-huh, that's
fun! You are getting this.

19:28.233 --> 19:29.860
Now, I want you to put
some power behind it.

19:29.935 --> 19:31.562
I was... I'm trying
to put power behind it.

19:31.637 --> 19:34.037
Well, put some... Put some
of that Tyra power behind it.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.596
There you go.
There you go.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.669
Okay. Okay.

19:38.744 --> 19:39.972
Ball in.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.441
Let me talk to you
for a second.

19:43.081 --> 19:45.675
You can do this.
You have got the skill.

19:45.751 --> 19:48.777
You've got the... You've got
the height, just like I knew.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.721
So, I'm so proud of you. Now what we
need to do is we need to get you...

19:51.790 --> 19:54.657
We need to get
that Tyra power behind it.

19:54.726 --> 19:56.717
Tim, if you hit me
with that ball...

19:57.429 --> 20:01.297
Now what I want is I want you
to find a way to get that...

20:01.400 --> 20:02.697
That energy into it.

20:02.768 --> 20:03.996
Well, I'm trying that.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.128
Put something in your head
that just drives you crazy,

20:06.205 --> 20:09.732
that just bugs you and
then make that be the ball,

20:09.808 --> 20:12.106
and you just slam on it,
you know what I mean?

20:12.177 --> 20:14.941
Can you get something
like that in your brain?

20:16.248 --> 20:18.580
Yeah. I think... I think
I can think of something.

20:18.650 --> 20:21.619
That's my girl. All right.
Come on now. Let's see it.

20:22.087 --> 20:23.816
Come on, Tyra.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.015
TAMl: Uh-huh, I knew it.

20:29.661 --> 20:31.253
TAMl: Now we're going!

20:45.310 --> 20:47.107
TAMl: Hit it.
Hit it right at him.

20:48.647 --> 20:50.512
This bad boy has all
the advantages of a hybrid.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.551
Hey, but if you need to, you can lock
the electric motors out of the drive train

20:53.619 --> 20:56.486
when extreme engine power is
needed to haul a huge load, okay?

20:56.555 --> 20:59.615
This thing can tow about, I don't
know, it's about 6,000 pounds.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.757
Yeah, I don't know.

21:03.328 --> 21:04.761
Well, did you like
the way it drove?

21:04.830 --> 21:06.024
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

21:06.465 --> 21:09.957
Okay, well, look, if it's
a matter of price, or cost,

21:10.035 --> 21:11.366
we could probably talk
to my supervisor...

21:11.436 --> 21:13.301
No, it's just,
I'm...

21:13.372 --> 21:15.602
I'm just gonna look around
a little more. All right?

21:16.875 --> 21:17.967
But thanks.

21:18.043 --> 21:19.237
No problem.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.943
Come back if you
make up your mind.

21:26.251 --> 21:28.151
Hey, J.
Figure it out.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.188
How's it going, babe?
Get him? Get him?

21:30.255 --> 21:32.120
No. It's...

21:32.691 --> 21:35.319
How's it going? It's going horribly. Yeah.

21:35.394 --> 21:37.123
That's how it's going.
I just...

21:37.195 --> 21:38.423
I'm not
cut out for this.

21:38.497 --> 21:39.987
I'm terrible
at this job.

21:40.065 --> 21:41.089
You know...

21:41.166 --> 21:43.031
Mr. Garrity, I just spent
two-and-a-half hours with a customer

21:43.101 --> 21:44.864
who just walked out
on me for no reason

21:44.936 --> 21:47.996
right when I thought I was gonna
get him. Right then and there.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.541
On top of everything else,
the whole crew here hates me

21:50.609 --> 21:52.577
'cause I messed up
the point system.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.475
So that's how everything's
going, sir. The what?

21:54.546 --> 21:55.979
The what?
The point system.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.845
The where the top
seller has the...

21:57.916 --> 21:59.884
They told you there
was a point system?

22:00.652 --> 22:01.846
Yes, sir.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.286
God!
Did Annabel tell you that?

22:04.356 --> 22:06.119
Wait, there's no point system?
No, there's no point system.

22:06.191 --> 22:08.523
They lied to you. I can't
believe that little filly.

22:08.593 --> 22:09.685
Wait a minute,
she lied to me?

22:09.761 --> 22:12.229
Yeah, she did.
Just don't worry about it.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.025
Hey, you keep
your head up.

22:16.101 --> 22:19.229
And Gerald, the guy that just
came in here, he's a tire kicker.

22:19.304 --> 22:21.499
He's a Looky Loo,
is what I call him.

22:21.573 --> 22:24.633
He comes in here every week, twice
a week, he looks, he never buys.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.075
Now you just refocus.

22:26.144 --> 22:31.104
Next person that comes in, you find out
what they want to hear, you tell it to them.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.480
It's just a job, Jason.

22:32.551 --> 22:35.019
That's all it is. It's nothing
more, it's nothing less.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.315
Yes, sir.
Some days are not good.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.481
It's just like two-a-days. You
don't know why you're doing it,

22:38.557 --> 22:40.491
and then later on in
the season, it pays off.

22:40.559 --> 22:41.787
Yes, sir.
It's the same thing here.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.157
Yes, sir.
That's all you think.

22:43.228 --> 22:44.286
You just keep focused.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.387
Okay.
You can do it.

22:45.464 --> 22:46.795
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. All right.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.230
Knock one down.

22:50.502 --> 22:51.833
Annabel!

22:54.673 --> 22:57.141
Have you ever had
the sizzling apple pie?

22:58.110 --> 22:59.338
No, I haven't.
Is it good?

22:59.411 --> 23:03.279
Yeah, it's really good. It's
like... It comes out sizzling.

23:03.348 --> 23:04.508
Sizzling?
Yeah, it'II...

23:04.583 --> 23:06.073
It'll save your life. It's amazing. Weird.

23:06.151 --> 23:08.176
It'll definitely help with physics. Hi.

23:08.253 --> 23:09.481
Hey. What are
you gonna get?

23:09.554 --> 23:10.816
Hi. I didn't know
you were...

23:10.889 --> 23:12.857
Didn't know you were working
today. This is a surprise.

23:12.924 --> 23:14.414
Yeah, shift change.

23:17.195 --> 23:18.662
So, can I start you all,
you know,

23:18.730 --> 23:20.357
with some water before
I come and take your order?

23:20.432 --> 23:22.491
It sounds great to me.
Yeah. Just water.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.364
All right. Just working on some physics here.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.427
So, we need some...

23:27.639 --> 23:28.697
That's your friend
from school.

23:28.774 --> 23:29.968
Uh-huh.

23:31.710 --> 23:36.170
So, you're wearing a Mayhem shirt.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.545
I am.
Yeah.

23:37.616 --> 23:39.140
Isn't the singer,
like, a cannibal?

23:39.217 --> 23:41.811
'Cause you're in, like,
a Christian power metal band.

23:41.887 --> 23:45.152
Seems kind of weird.
I don't know.

23:45.223 --> 23:46.588
No, actually that
was just a rumor.

23:46.658 --> 23:48.683
But he didn't
actually eat anyone.

23:48.760 --> 23:53.220
And Crucifictorious is
actually... It's not power metal.

23:53.532 --> 23:57.832
We're more of extreme grindcore
with like, heavy thrash influences.

23:57.903 --> 24:00.531
Like what thrash bands do
you like? Like Napalm Death?

24:00.605 --> 24:02.038
Like the Keep?

24:02.574 --> 24:04.633
Like Cannibal Corpse?

24:04.810 --> 24:09.372
Carcass, I mean, I really only have two
sections for vinyl. Like metal, non-metal.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.109
So...
Right.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.241
Well, mainly...

24:12.951 --> 24:14.384
You all ready to order?

24:15.720 --> 24:18.814
Yeah. I want the
sizzling apple pie.

24:18.890 --> 24:21.484
And I think also
chips and...

24:25.197 --> 24:27.188
Oh, my...
That's pathetic.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.792
I'm back at the start.

24:32.370 --> 24:33.598
What's up?

24:36.641 --> 24:38.040
Um...

24:39.511 --> 24:40.910
What's the matter?

24:42.147 --> 24:43.739
Sorry. I...
That's...

24:44.282 --> 24:47.115
...haven't been honest with
you about a couple things.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.880
Okay.

24:51.456 --> 24:55.222
I lied to you about babysitting
my brother the other night.

24:59.197 --> 25:02.530
That guy at church
was Tim Riggins.

25:02.601 --> 25:03.795
Mmm-hmm.

25:06.872 --> 25:09.306
We have
kind of a history together.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.870
Okay, what kind
of history?

25:15.814 --> 25:17.338
Get the door, Brian.

25:22.721 --> 25:23.745
Hey.

25:23.822 --> 25:27.656
Hey, I just came
by to say that I'm sorry.

25:29.094 --> 25:30.356
Come in.

25:32.931 --> 25:34.262
Hey, Noannie.

25:34.332 --> 25:35.765
Didn't Mom ban her?

25:36.134 --> 25:40.127
Noannie, please. Just watch
your show and be easy, all right?

25:42.474 --> 25:44.408
I just feel so bad
about everything.

25:44.476 --> 25:46.842
I really cannot believe you
had to apologize like that.

25:46.912 --> 25:48.277
I wish we could
erase that whole day.

25:49.948 --> 25:51.677
It's gonna be okay.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.911
This whole thing
gonna blow over.

25:54.019 --> 25:56.954
I was really
worried about you.

25:57.022 --> 25:58.546
Smash always
lands on his feet.

25:58.623 --> 25:59.817
Hello?

26:01.426 --> 26:02.688
Who is that?

26:03.261 --> 26:05.252
No. No, I don't.
Who is this?

26:05.897 --> 26:07.091
Noannie,
give me the phone.

26:07.165 --> 26:10.362
You guys are jerks. Stop calling
here or I'm calling the police.

26:11.803 --> 26:12.861
Oh, my God.

26:12.938 --> 26:14.132
Who was that?

26:14.205 --> 26:15.604
No one.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.499
Noannie.

26:18.843 --> 26:22.006
It's just some idiots calling
saying stupid things, okay?

26:22.380 --> 26:23.574
Like what?

26:24.316 --> 26:25.442
Brian, it's stupid.

26:25.517 --> 26:26.882
Like what, Noannie?

26:26.952 --> 26:30.217
He says he hears
I put out to white boys.

26:37.228 --> 26:39.856
He calls here again,
you give the phone to me.

26:40.465 --> 26:41.762
Do you hear me?

26:43.301 --> 26:44.962
Do you hear me?
Yeah.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.469
This is all my
fault, isn't it?

26:48.707 --> 26:49.799
No.

26:49.874 --> 26:52.434
No, don't you
ever say that.

26:52.510 --> 26:56.139
Noannie, look. Look, this
has nothing to do with you.

26:57.816 --> 26:59.477
Come here. Come here.

27:10.695 --> 27:15.792
I know, I know, I slept with my
paralyzed boyfriend's best friend.

27:16.234 --> 27:18.259
It's the worst thing
I've ever done.

27:30.248 --> 27:32.443
It would be great
if you said something.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.649
Sorry, I'm just

27:37.455 --> 27:40.618
thinking how hard that must
have been for you to tell me.

27:41.960 --> 27:45.521
And I'm really
glad that you did.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.536
I just want us to be
honest with each other.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.233
Do you still have
feelings for him?

27:56.307 --> 27:59.276
Nope. No. No.

28:05.617 --> 28:06.948
Okay.

28:12.223 --> 28:14.282
Now let's go get
some ice cream.

28:15.293 --> 28:18.421
Well... Just in a minute.

28:37.849 --> 28:40.909
Hey, Street, here comes your best friend.

28:41.653 --> 28:43.484
Oh, that's funny.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.455
Somebody's got
to talk to him.

28:45.523 --> 28:48.083
Low man on the totem pole,
that would be you.

28:57.836 --> 28:59.997
Hi there.
Interested in a Malibu.

29:09.547 --> 29:10.946
Afternoon, Gerald.

29:11.382 --> 29:12.440
Oh, hey.

29:12.517 --> 29:14.075
How you
doing today?

29:14.152 --> 29:16.848
All right. Just
came to have a second look.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.851
Yeah. Can I ask you
something, Gerald?

29:21.926 --> 29:22.984
Yeah.

29:23.061 --> 29:25.029
What's the problem exactly?

29:26.064 --> 29:28.555
Sorry? Why won't you let
yourself have this car?

29:29.234 --> 29:30.963
What do you mean?
What is it really?

29:31.035 --> 29:32.866
Is it that you think if you
buy this car you're gonna

29:32.937 --> 29:36.270
find another car you like better
elsewhere immediately after buying it?

29:36.341 --> 29:38.832
Or is it that you just think
you don't deserve the car?

29:38.910 --> 29:40.241
Man, you don't know me.
No, Gerald.

29:40.311 --> 29:43.246
Please, I'm not insulting you, so
please don't take it like that, okay?

29:43.314 --> 29:45.145
I'm just trying
to understand you.

29:45.750 --> 29:49.151
Because all these salespeople
around here, take a look at them.

29:49.220 --> 29:51.154
They sent me over here because
they've given up on you.

29:51.222 --> 29:53.190
All right? They sent me,
wheelchair guy, rookie,

29:53.258 --> 29:56.159
low man on the totem pole to talk to you
because none of them believe that you can

29:56.227 --> 29:58.457
pull the trigger on actually
purchasing a vehicle.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.623
But let me tell you something,
I know you love this car.

30:00.698 --> 30:03.189
You love this car so much that
you come in two days a week.

30:03.268 --> 30:06.169
Two days a week to just look
at it and then you walk out.

30:06.237 --> 30:09.968
Gerald, life's too short, man.
Life is too short. Okay?

30:10.041 --> 30:11.133
Things change
in an instant.

30:11.209 --> 30:12.938
Take it from me. Okay.

30:13.444 --> 30:14.775
So be a man.

30:14.846 --> 30:18.282
Take control of your life.
Be a man. Buy this car.

30:18.783 --> 30:21.843
Show all these people that they're
wrong. That you can make a decision.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.148
I'm gonna really
think about it.

30:23.221 --> 30:24.313
No. No more
thinking, Gerald.

30:24.389 --> 30:25.754
No more thinking.
No more dithering.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.621
No more wasting everybody's
time, especially your own.

30:27.692 --> 30:28.920
'Cause that's what
you're doing.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.392
You're wasting your time
every time you come in here.

30:30.461 --> 30:33.726
Buy this car because you love
it and because you want this car

30:33.798 --> 30:37.427
and you want to drive off this
lot in this car today. Buy it.

30:42.140 --> 30:43.334
Okay.

30:43.641 --> 30:44.733
Okay.

30:45.076 --> 30:46.338
Mr. Garrity!

30:47.078 --> 30:48.204
Yes, sir.

30:48.279 --> 30:50.509
All right, Gerald over here would
like to go ahead and start paperwork

30:50.582 --> 30:52.140
on purchasing
this hybrid here.

30:52.217 --> 30:53.411
Yes, I would.

30:56.821 --> 30:59.881
Congratulations, Gerald.
Congratulations.

30:59.958 --> 31:00.982
Well, thank you.

31:11.803 --> 31:12.929
Hey.

31:13.571 --> 31:15.732
Hey.
So we made an A.

31:15.974 --> 31:17.305
Did we really?
Yeah.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.370
Yeah. It's cool, right?

31:19.444 --> 31:20.809
Congratulations. It was
the best grade in the class.

31:20.879 --> 31:25.043
Thank you. Also,
I made you something.

31:25.116 --> 31:30.349
I sensed a bit of reluctance on your part
to embrace the cheese that is power metal,

31:30.421 --> 31:32.855
so it's your very
own power metal mix.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.292
Wow. It's actually... You
said, "Parking lot mix" on here.

31:36.361 --> 31:38.625
It's like heavy metal
parking lot, you know?

31:38.696 --> 31:40.391
Do I have to
listen to it in a parking lot?

31:40.465 --> 31:43.127
No, cars, bedrooms,
whatever.

31:43.201 --> 31:44.862
Bedrooms.
Wow! Sweet.

31:46.204 --> 31:47.637
Whatever. Anyway.

31:47.705 --> 31:49.866
But it was nice seeing
you. I'll see you around.

31:49.941 --> 31:51.203
Well, I appreciate it.
Bye, guys.

31:51.276 --> 31:52.573
Yeah.
Thank you.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.202
Cheers.
No problem there.

31:54.812 --> 31:56.302
Wow. Soul mate,
right there.

31:56.381 --> 31:58.246
God's little gift to Landry,
that's what that is.

31:58.316 --> 32:00.648
Why can't you just
be happy...

32:01.853 --> 32:03.286
Hey, Smash,
you're on TV, homes.

32:03.354 --> 32:05.879
<i>And I want to apologize to
him and everyone for doing so.</i>

32:05.957 --> 32:07.822
<i>Anyone can say, "I'm sorry. "
Doesn't mean they are.</i>

32:07.892 --> 32:10.759
<i>Smash Williams is an
arrogant, violent thug</i>

32:10.828 --> 32:13.023
<i>who attacked us just because
we're white and have money.</i>

32:13.097 --> 32:14.564
<i>And everyone's defending him.</i>

32:14.632 --> 32:16.327
<i>He's lucky me and my
friends acted civilized.</i>

32:16.401 --> 32:18.426
<i>And from the
Smash Williams controversy,</i>

32:18.503 --> 32:20.630
<i>we go now to Kevin with the
rest of today's sports headlines.</i>

32:20.705 --> 32:21.831
Smash?

32:21.906 --> 32:22.964
Hey, what the hell
are you doing here?

32:23.041 --> 32:24.565
Looking for you, man.
Did you see Adam Hughes on TV?

32:24.642 --> 32:26.633
Do you want to respond... No,
you're trying to get me in trouble!

32:26.711 --> 32:27.837
I'm just trying
to get the truth.

32:27.912 --> 32:29.038
Hey, hey! Tell him
the truth, Smash.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.411
Just shut the hell up!
Just shut the hell up!

32:31.482 --> 32:33.507
Smash, what happened that night?
Was your sister hitting on him?

32:33.584 --> 32:34.915
Is what he said true?

32:35.320 --> 32:36.753
Hell, no, that's not true!

32:36.821 --> 32:39.255
That's not true. All right,
look, I'll tell you like this.

32:39.324 --> 32:41.417
He was saying some foul
things to my sister and I.

32:41.492 --> 32:43.790
Racial, sexual and threatening. That's right.

32:43.861 --> 32:46.557
Now, if somebody comes around your little
sister and starts talking like that,

32:46.631 --> 32:47.893
you just gonna stand
there and smile?

32:47.966 --> 32:49.661
No. You're gonna ask
him to stop, which I did.

32:49.734 --> 32:51.964
And if they don't stop, what?
You're not gonna do anything?

32:52.036 --> 32:53.731
So are you saying you
should not have apologized?

32:53.805 --> 32:54.931
Not the way he's talking.

32:55.006 --> 32:56.337
So that's a yes?

33:01.079 --> 33:02.706
He didn't deserve
an apology.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.407
<i>He deserved
worse than what I gave him.</i>

33:04.482 --> 33:06.507
<i>I should've messed
him up worse.</i>

33:07.952 --> 33:10.318
<i>And with that latest
salvo from Smash Williams,</i>

33:10.388 --> 33:13.653
<i>it appears the Dillon Panthers
problems are far from over.</i>

33:13.725 --> 33:15.716
Turn it off,
will you, Crowley?

33:20.798 --> 33:22.425
Hey, hey, hey!

33:23.167 --> 33:25.328
Hubby's home.
How was your day, darling?

33:25.403 --> 33:27.234
It was...
It was good.

33:27.605 --> 33:30.165
It was good.
I sold a car, so...

33:30.408 --> 33:32.069
What? You did?

33:34.645 --> 33:36.806
Out-freaking-standing!

33:36.881 --> 33:38.712
Oh, man! You did!

33:38.916 --> 33:39.940
Whoa.

33:40.018 --> 33:43.317
So, what? You're like, you're like a car
salesman now. You're like Willy Loman!

33:43.388 --> 33:45.219
Yeah, you a salesman, huh?

33:46.691 --> 33:48.352
Yeah. I guess I am.

33:50.595 --> 33:52.062
Hey, man.
It's all good, right?

33:52.130 --> 33:54.758
Look, you get a little money in
your pocket. Nothing wrong with that.

33:54.832 --> 33:56.857
Just for now, right?
Plus it's always good

33:56.934 --> 33:59.459
to have a roommate that can
pay his half of the rent.

34:02.206 --> 34:05.334
Hey, what do you say you and
me head down to the rec center?

34:05.410 --> 34:07.105
Got a pick-up
rugby game going on.

34:07.178 --> 34:11.114
Then afterwards, maybe go
get me some ribs, some corn.

34:11.181 --> 34:14.481
Some hot chicks. Maybe
she got a friend for you.

34:14.552 --> 34:18.318
But one of them ugly ones. Buck-toothed
and, you know, just got the fangs.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.447
Got the fangs
happening, huh?

34:21.626 --> 34:23.286
Know what? Yeah.
Huh?

34:23.360 --> 34:24.918
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah? Yeah?

34:24.996 --> 34:26.896
Just give me a couple
minutes to change

34:26.964 --> 34:29.125
and then we'll
head on out.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.259
Oh, dinner's on you tonight.
You still owe me...

34:31.335 --> 34:32.802
I think, what is it,
$19.40?

34:32.870 --> 34:34.132
Oh, you're serious
about that?

34:34.205 --> 34:35.399
So... Yeah.
Dinner and girls.

34:35.473 --> 34:36.496
Both on you tonight.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.871
No, the girls
will be on me. I...

34:39.877 --> 34:41.435
Brucey, Moreno,
Lung-Dog...

34:41.512 --> 34:44.413
I mean, all those guys started
investing a couple months back.

34:44.482 --> 34:45.505
They're doing well.

34:45.583 --> 34:49.781
I mean, so... Like, if those idiots can
do stuff in the stock market, why can't I?

34:49.853 --> 34:51.253
Oh, my God,
what are you gonna...

34:51.322 --> 34:54.416
You're gonna apply your grade
nine education to the stock market?

34:56.494 --> 34:57.791
I'm not...
That's...

34:57.862 --> 34:58.851
Shh.

35:05.536 --> 35:06.935
Yeah. Go.
Be quiet.

35:08.673 --> 35:11.437
Hey.
Sorry.

35:12.009 --> 35:13.806
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

35:14.979 --> 35:16.503
So, what's up?
Tim here?

35:16.581 --> 35:18.014
Billy.
Yeah.

35:23.087 --> 35:24.679
Came to bring you this.

35:25.590 --> 35:26.614
What's this?

35:26.691 --> 35:28.124
It's the money
you owe those guys.

35:28.192 --> 35:29.420
I don't want you
to get beat up again.

35:29.494 --> 35:30.654
I'm not bringing
you into this.

35:30.728 --> 35:32.889
You're not bringing
me into anything, Tim.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.556
Is this why
you came over?

35:37.502 --> 35:40.596
Yeah. And I'm not...

35:40.671 --> 35:42.605
I'm not coming
back here anymore.

35:43.441 --> 35:45.068
Chris makes me happy.

35:48.479 --> 35:49.673
That's it.

35:49.747 --> 35:51.214
I'm not taking it.
Okay.

35:54.619 --> 35:55.711
All right.

36:21.979 --> 36:24.072
Nice, y'all!
That's the way!

36:26.184 --> 36:29.312
That's the way!
Good teamwork!

36:36.994 --> 36:38.928
You all need to call it!

36:40.231 --> 36:43.758
Watch that hole in the center,
okay? You all need to pick that up.

36:51.676 --> 36:53.667
Hey, time out! Time out.

36:55.079 --> 36:56.137
It's looking great, girls.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.239
They're double blocking
me every time. That's okay.

36:58.316 --> 36:59.408
No, they've
figured out our move.

36:59.483 --> 37:01.815
No, they did not. Now, don't
you act like this is luck.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.717
This is not luck. You
all are doing a great job.

37:03.788 --> 37:05.415
We are kind of lucky 'cause
their star hitter's out sick.

37:05.489 --> 37:07.855
TAMl: No, you all are playing a great
game. You're playing a great game.

37:07.925 --> 37:10.086
I want you to keep it up. I want
you to keep it simple and remember,

37:10.161 --> 37:13.130
you are playing this game and you are
winning this game because of your teamwork.

37:13.197 --> 37:14.789
You are a team.
You work together.

37:14.865 --> 37:16.890
And you, you just
focus on that Riggins.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.902
You slam it down his throat.
You all got it?

37:18.970 --> 37:21.097
Get out there. You know you
can do this. Let's go, girls.

37:21.172 --> 37:23.606
One-two-three...
Panthers!

37:40.858 --> 37:42.086
TAMl: That's you.

37:48.065 --> 37:50.295
All right, girls!
That's what I'm talking about!

37:50.368 --> 37:52.768
All right, keep it together!
Keep it together!

38:36.147 --> 38:37.671
You had fun, right?

38:41.819 --> 38:43.980
Good job! Good job!

38:44.889 --> 38:45.913
How about that?

38:45.990 --> 38:48.151
So what? They're like, what?
One and seven now?

38:48.993 --> 38:52.087
Why you got to be like that
for? Mom is one and one!

38:52.496 --> 38:54.088
The team is one and seven. It's one and 0!

38:54.165 --> 38:55.189
One for one!

39:01.372 --> 39:02.703
Ready?

39:09.880 --> 39:10.938
Hey.

39:12.450 --> 39:13.474
What's up, boys?

39:13.551 --> 39:15.416
Let's just get this
over with, all right?

39:15.486 --> 39:17.351
Here's your money.
How you doing, Billy?

39:17.421 --> 39:18.786
It's good to see you.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.855
All right, it's all there.
I'll see you around.

39:21.926 --> 39:24.326
Now, just come on in. Let's count
it first. Make sure it's all here.

39:24.395 --> 39:25.657
If you got the money,
we're good.

39:25.730 --> 39:27.857
It's all there.
Just bring it in, man. Okay?

39:27.932 --> 39:30.901
I wanna make sure I got my
money, so come on in and count it.

39:30.968 --> 39:37.567
One hundred, two, three, four five, six,
seven, eight, nine, we're up to a thousand?

39:38.042 --> 39:39.600
Yeah.
There's one.

39:39.677 --> 39:43.340
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,

39:43.414 --> 39:46.178
eighteen, nineteen,
two thousand.

39:46.917 --> 39:48.441
Getting closer.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.480
What's wrong, Tim?
You look a little depressed.

39:51.555 --> 39:52.647
Okay, can we just get
this over with, man?

39:52.723 --> 39:54.020
Just count the money
and let us get out of here.

39:54.091 --> 39:58.187
Hey! You wanna calm down, man? You would think
I wasn't the one that got ripped off here.

39:58.262 --> 39:59.695
Yeah, why don't you call
the cops then, Guy?

39:59.764 --> 40:01.129
Ooh, good one, Billy.

40:01.198 --> 40:06.602
Three... Six... Twenty-nine.
What do you know?

40:06.937 --> 40:08.666
It's all there.
All right.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.263
It's taken care of
and it's all paid up

40:10.341 --> 40:12.002
and he don't owe you
a dime extra, all right?

40:12.076 --> 40:13.703
Billy, let's go.
It's over with now.

40:13.778 --> 40:15.370
I don't want a dime extra.

40:15.446 --> 40:17.107
And you're not gonna touch
him again. You hear me?

40:17.181 --> 40:20.412
I hope he doesn't give me a reason to
touch him again and I hope you don't...

40:20.484 --> 40:21.951
I don't give a crap if
he gives you a reason.

40:22.019 --> 40:23.384
You're not gonna touch
him again, just say it.

40:23.454 --> 40:24.443
Billy, let's go.

40:24.522 --> 40:26.490
You need to calm... You need
to tell your little brother...

40:26.557 --> 40:27.751
Listen to me,
you fat son of a bitch!

40:27.825 --> 40:30.350
You're not gonna touch him
again, you understand me?

40:30.428 --> 40:31.952
How's Jackie?
You don't touch...

40:32.029 --> 40:33.462
Billy! Billy!

40:33.531 --> 40:35.294
You're barking up the
wrong tree! Hey! Get out!

40:35.366 --> 40:36.856
You are barking down
the wrong tree!

40:36.934 --> 40:38.162
Billy!

40:39.970 --> 40:43.406
Go! Jesus Christ, Billy!
What are you thinking, man?

40:43.474 --> 40:44.498
Get in the truck!

40:44.575 --> 40:46.270
Barking up
the wrong tree, Billy!

40:46.343 --> 40:48.038
He's got a gun. He's got a
gun. Just get in the truck.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.443
Keep your little
brother away from me.

40:49.513 --> 40:50.912
Start the truck.
Start the truck.

40:50.981 --> 40:52.346
I'm trying! Gun, man, he's got the gun!

40:52.416 --> 40:54.611
I know, Billy, I'm trying.
Just go!

40:57.054 --> 40:58.749
What were you thinking?

41:22.546 --> 41:23.979
Come on in.

41:25.749 --> 41:27.740
Coach got something
he wanna tell you.

41:33.891 --> 41:35.483
The board called.

41:37.261 --> 41:38.819
They've decided

41:40.231 --> 41:42.961
to suspend you
for three games.

41:43.033 --> 41:44.466
Suspend me?

41:46.136 --> 41:47.433
But they can't do that,
can they?

41:47.505 --> 41:49.530
They can and they have.

41:56.046 --> 41:57.946
Is this 'cause I told
that reporter the truth?

41:58.015 --> 41:59.505
Baby, that didn't help.

42:06.757 --> 42:08.748
That's the rest
of the regular season.

42:11.328 --> 42:13.819
How the hell we gonna
get to the playoffs?

42:17.368 --> 42:19.199
How we gonna
make it to State?
