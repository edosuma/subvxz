<i>Existence.</i>

00:28.299 --> 00:31.719
<i>Well, what does it matter?</i>

00:33.805 --> 00:36.557
<i>I exist on the best terms I can.</i>

00:38.226 --> 00:41.354
<i>The past is now part of my future.</i>

00:42.563 --> 00:45.691
<i>The present is well out of hand.</i>

01:17.849 --> 01:19.392
Get it.

01:22.812 --> 01:25.148
Ian. Pass us the ball, will you?

01:26.357 --> 01:28.234
Knob cheese.

01:57.472 --> 01:59.557
All right, Ian?

03:01.077 --> 03:02.203
Ian.

03:03.329 --> 03:04.705
Oh, you got it.

03:05.915 --> 03:07.166
Today.

03:08.042 --> 03:10.503
This is Deborah, you know,
who I told you about.

03:10.670 --> 03:12.338
From the youth club.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.263
You can't be in my gang
if you don't smoke.

03:20.721 --> 03:22.598
Don't wanna be in your gang.

03:24.350 --> 03:25.977
Neither do I.

03:51.043 --> 03:52.962
I think we should go.

03:53.880 --> 03:55.840
- Now?
- Yeah. I wanna go.

03:59.719 --> 04:00.845
OK.

04:02.054 --> 04:03.723
Ian, we're getting off.

04:12.607 --> 04:16.152
- Who's the writer?
- Who'd you think?

04:37.882 --> 04:40.760
Glucose...

04:40.927 --> 04:42.637
...plus oxygen...

04:44.555 --> 04:49.936
Carbon dioxide plus water.

04:51.854 --> 04:54.232
You can clearly see here
that the chemicals

04:54.398 --> 04:56.818
are currently out of balance.

04:56.984 --> 05:00.446
Your task will be
to alter the molar ratios

05:00.613 --> 05:03.282
in order to make the chemicals balance

05:03.449 --> 05:07.745
before and after the combustion
reaction has occurred.

05:12.375 --> 05:15.127
Wouldn't you say that was so,
Mr Curtis?

05:17.129 --> 05:19.048
Ian?

05:19.215 --> 05:20.967
Come on, stop messing.

05:21.133 --> 05:23.052
Uh, Mr Curtis?

05:30.017 --> 05:31.477
What?

05:35.648 --> 05:37.150
Sorry, sir.

05:41.821 --> 05:43.447
Who have we got today, then?

05:43.614 --> 05:45.366
Mrs Brady.

05:46.534 --> 05:50.079
- We done her before?
- Don't think so.

05:50.246 --> 05:53.499
Let's hope she's got
a sympathetic doctor.

05:55.376 --> 05:59.130
I mean, I like
me neighbours, don't get me wrong.

05:59.297 --> 06:02.717
Mind you, the stink of some of them.

06:02.884 --> 06:05.803
I tell you, they don't wash
or don't know how to.

06:06.762 --> 06:09.432
Stink, stink, stink.

06:10.224 --> 06:12.059
Stink to high heaven of piss.

06:12.226 --> 06:15.855
Mrs Brady, please can I use
your toilet, please?

06:16.022 --> 06:17.690
'Course you can, love.

06:18.483 --> 06:22.028
- Second on the left, down the hall.
- Thank you.

06:23.446 --> 06:25.114
Where was I?

06:25.281 --> 06:26.991
Oh, yes.

06:38.544 --> 06:42.882
It says here Cirazapan usually
prescribed for schizophrenia.

06:43.049 --> 06:48.054
Side effects include drowsiness,
apathy, agitation

06:48.221 --> 06:50.681
and blurred vision.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.476
I'm taking two.

07:07.865 --> 07:09.909
Oh, here we go. Who's that?

07:10.076 --> 07:12.203
Stop it now! Stop it.

07:15.331 --> 07:16.791
- Hi.
- Hi, Nick.

07:16.958 --> 07:19.585
Nick, yeah. Hi.

07:21.212 --> 07:22.922
- Ian.
- Hi.

07:23.089 --> 07:24.632
Hi.

07:24.799 --> 07:28.177
Oh, wow, a dog. What's her name?

07:28.344 --> 07:30.304
- Tess.
- Hello, Tess.

07:30.471 --> 07:33.057
Come around to speak to, you know...

07:33.224 --> 07:36.060
See if she wants to... for a bit.

07:36.227 --> 07:39.647
- Debbie.
- Debbie, yeah. Yeah.

07:40.273 --> 07:42.525
Debbie. Hi.

07:42.692 --> 07:46.154
- Hi.
- She's gorgeous. Debbie, hi.

07:46.320 --> 07:49.615
Hi. Do you want to come in?

07:53.369 --> 07:54.579
Hi.

07:55.371 --> 07:56.581
Hi.

08:09.719 --> 08:12.388
<i>My heart leaps up when I behold</i>

08:12.555 --> 08:14.348
<i>A rainbow in the sky</i>

08:16.225 --> 08:18.728
<i>So it was my life began</i>

08:19.770 --> 08:22.231
<i>So is it now I am a man</i>

08:23.608 --> 08:26.569
<i>So it be when I shall grow old</i>

08:27.361 --> 08:29.071
<i>Or let me die</i>

08:30.323 --> 08:32.991
<i>The child is the father of the man</i>

08:33.951 --> 08:36.578
<i>And I could wish my days to be</i>

08:37.621 --> 08:41.583
<i>Bound each to each by natural piety</i>

08:52.220 --> 08:55.431
- Did you write that?
- Wordsworth.

10:22.977 --> 10:24.437
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

10:28.065 --> 10:30.735
- I'm really excited for this.
- Yeah. Same here.

10:30.902 --> 10:33.654
Never really into Bowie before,
you know, but...

10:39.035 --> 10:40.703
It's a shame Nick couldn't come.

10:42.455 --> 10:44.123
He did say I could go out with you.

10:44.290 --> 10:47.960
He said it was all right.
As long as I looked after you.

10:48.711 --> 10:50.296
Did he now?

10:52.632 --> 10:56.636
Well, I didn't want him thinking we were
going behind his back or anything.

10:57.762 --> 11:00.056
That's a bit presumptuous,
don't you think?

11:01.599 --> 11:03.142
Why?

11:03.309 --> 11:05.436
I might not have wanted
to go out with you.

11:05.603 --> 11:08.314
- Go over there.
- All right.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.832
<i> I wish I were a Warhol silkscreen</i>

11:25.998 --> 11:27.667
<i>Hanging on the wall</i>

11:27.834 --> 11:31.128
<i>Or little Joe or maybe Lou</i>

11:31.295 --> 11:32.964
<i>I'd love to be them all</i>

11:33.840 --> 11:36.259
<i>All New York City's broken hearts</i>

11:36.425 --> 11:38.427
<i>And secrets would be mine</i>

11:39.137 --> 11:40.972
<i>I'd put you on a movie reel</i>

11:41.139 --> 11:44.142
<i>And that would be just fine</i>

12:13.171 --> 12:14.922
I think we should get married.

12:18.134 --> 12:19.677
Are you asking?

12:21.971 --> 12:23.681
You're mine.

12:24.390 --> 12:26.476
Irretrievably.

12:28.060 --> 12:30.813
- Am I now?
- Yeah.

12:32.648 --> 12:34.192
And you know it.

13:25.493 --> 13:27.745
Ian?

13:27.912 --> 13:29.372
I've got a brew for you.

13:34.001 --> 13:35.461
Ian?

13:48.141 --> 13:49.267
All right, lads?

13:49.433 --> 13:51.102
- All right.
- All right, mate.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.397
It's a bit empty in here tonight.

13:54.564 --> 13:56.691
- Tony Wilson's over there.
- Who?

13:57.275 --> 13:59.610
Posh bloke from Granada TV.

13:59.777 --> 14:02.947
- Oh, yeah.
- One day he'll be recognising me.

14:03.114 --> 14:06.325
- You'll have to be out a bit more.
- Yeah.

14:06.993 --> 14:08.452
Been a bit busy.

14:08.619 --> 14:10.997
Getting married, finding a house.

14:11.164 --> 14:12.582
Sounds like fun.

14:13.875 --> 14:17.420
- How's the band?
- Yeah. Not bad.

14:17.587 --> 14:19.922
It's not particularly good
either, is it?

14:21.883 --> 14:25.094
No. We're pretty shite.

14:25.261 --> 14:28.473
Be a lot less shite if we could find
a singer who could sing.

14:33.186 --> 14:36.105
I'm really looking forward
to seeing this lot tonight.

14:36.272 --> 14:39.442
Apparently they tear up the stage
and kick off mid-set.

14:40.902 --> 14:44.280
- All right?
- Gotta go.

14:44.447 --> 14:47.074
- Take it easy.
- See you soon, Ian.

14:48.993 --> 14:51.871
- Embarrassed of me or something?
- No.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.919
- He's all right, him, isn't he?
- Yeah.

14:58.085 --> 15:00.671
A bit tall, bit odd, but yeah.

15:34.872 --> 15:37.792
So you're really
looking for a singer, then?

17:18.851 --> 17:21.813
So, what do you like doing, Colin?

17:21.979 --> 17:24.065
Watching telly.

17:24.232 --> 17:29.487
- Apart from watching telly?
- Hmm, having breakfast, lunch and tea.

17:30.613 --> 17:32.698
Food? Well, that's a start.

17:32.865 --> 17:35.201
There's plenty ofjobs
that involve food.

17:35.368 --> 17:36.577
And watch telly.

17:36.744 --> 17:40.164
- So you like food and watching telly?
- That's right.

17:41.207 --> 17:42.500
Well...

17:42.667 --> 17:45.795
There's a job here working
at Knutsford Cinema

17:45.962 --> 17:48.589
behind the hot dog counter.
How does that sound?

17:48.756 --> 17:51.884
- I do not like hot dogs!
- OK.

17:52.051 --> 17:54.595
Well, should we give 'em
a ring anyway?

18:02.228 --> 18:04.397
The colour scheme is fuckin' brown

18:04.564 --> 18:05.982
Everywhere in chicken town

18:06.149 --> 18:09.610
The fuckin' pubs are fuckin' dull
The fuckin' clubs are fuckin' full

18:09.777 --> 18:11.612
Of fuckin' girls and fuckin' guys
With fuckin' murder in their eyes

18:11.779 --> 18:14.282
A fuckin' bloke gets fuckin' stabbed
Waitin' for a fuckin' cab

18:14.448 --> 18:17.201
You fuckin' stay at fuckin' home
The fuckin' neighbours fuckin' moan

18:17.368 --> 18:19.871
Keep the fuckin' racket down
This is fuckin' chicken town

18:23.875 --> 18:25.918
I'm a bit nervous, me.

18:27.336 --> 18:29.589
Just with it being recorded
and all that.

18:32.133 --> 18:34.635
I mean, we're actually
gonna be on a record.

18:34.802 --> 18:36.971
I can play it at my gran's
and everything.

18:40.475 --> 18:42.643
How about you, Hooky?
You nervous or what?

18:42.810 --> 18:44.479
Am I fuck, man?

18:47.482 --> 18:50.610
- What about you, Ian?
- This is just the start.

18:53.946 --> 18:55.072
Steven?

18:57.325 --> 18:59.035
No.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.750
The fuckin' pies are fuckin' old
The fuckin' chips are fuckin' cold

19:05.917 --> 19:08.544
The fuckin' beer is fuckin' flat
The fuckin' flats have fuckin' rats

19:08.711 --> 19:11.589
The fuckin' clocks are fuckin' wrong
The fuckin' days are fuckin' long

19:11.756 --> 19:15.051
It fuckin' gets you fuckin' down
Evidently chicken town

19:15.218 --> 19:16.677
Thank you. Good night.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.477
Right, Warsaw, we're on.

19:24.644 --> 19:28.189
Fuckin' hell! Who's opened the ham?
You lot nervous or what?

19:36.864 --> 19:38.991
The next band of the night, folks:

19:39.158 --> 19:43.371
Warsaw!

19:51.629 --> 19:53.798
You all forgotten Rudolf Hess?

21:28.935 --> 21:30.770
Ian, it's 400 pound.

21:34.148 --> 21:36.067
Are you sure you want to do this?

21:36.234 --> 21:38.152
I know, but...

21:38.319 --> 21:40.571
The band are gonna pay us back.

21:44.659 --> 21:46.118
OK.

21:52.250 --> 21:54.126
Let's have a baby.

21:58.131 --> 21:59.423
OK.

22:22.446 --> 22:24.323
Four hundred quid.

22:28.578 --> 22:30.204
What are you lot called again?

22:30.371 --> 22:33.166
We were Warsaw.
Now we're Joy Division.

22:33.332 --> 22:36.169
Excuse me, but what happened
to Slaves of Venus?

22:36.335 --> 22:37.837
OK.

22:38.546 --> 22:41.424
- All right. Joy Division's good.
- Joy Division, eh?

22:41.591 --> 22:43.509
What's all that about?

22:44.093 --> 22:47.763
It's the name of a brothel German
soldiers used during World War II.

22:49.599 --> 22:52.602
Well, whatever. Studio's yours.

22:57.064 --> 22:59.817
And it folds up to hold the record.

23:02.111 --> 23:03.404
Have a look.

23:11.913 --> 23:13.831
Yeah, it's good that, Bernard.

23:15.208 --> 23:16.959
Thought-provoking.

23:18.419 --> 23:21.047
That's right. Her name's Corrine Lewis.

23:24.258 --> 23:26.260
<i>Is 2.45 Thursday all right?</i>

23:29.305 --> 23:31.808
OK, then, Mr Mathers,
she'll see you then.

23:32.850 --> 23:34.227
Bye.

23:35.019 --> 23:37.814
Done. He sounds keen.

23:49.784 --> 23:51.244
I'll get some water.

23:53.788 --> 23:58.209
<i> When you're looking at life
in a strange new room</i>

23:59.377 --> 24:01.087
<i>Maybe drowning soon</i>

24:02.213 --> 24:05.174
<i>Is this the start of it all?</i>

24:09.178 --> 24:11.264
I'd never stand for that.

24:12.849 --> 24:14.559
What?

24:14.725 --> 24:17.353
Being called something like
"the Buzzcocks".

24:18.396 --> 24:20.481
What are you on about?

24:20.648 --> 24:24.110
I don't know. I don't mind the Buzz,
but calling themselves Cocks.

24:24.277 --> 24:26.279
I don't get it.

24:26.445 --> 24:29.198
They're not calling themselves
the Cocks, are they?

24:29.365 --> 24:31.659
They're calling themselves
the Buzzcocks.

24:32.827 --> 24:35.705
Still got the word "cock" in it, though.

24:35.872 --> 24:38.457
Just saying I wouldn't stand for it,
that's all.

24:39.834 --> 24:44.130
<i> They were the Buzzcocks.
If you didn't know, well, now you do.</i>

24:44.297 --> 24:47.175
<i>- As you'll soon know about these lot...
- That's us!</i>

24:47.341 --> 24:50.261
<i>... a Manchester band called
Joy Division. This is an EP,</i>

24:50.428 --> 24:53.222
<i>An Ideal for Living.
And that wraps it up for tonight.</i>

24:53.389 --> 24:57.226
<i>Keep the music coming in. Next week
we have The Clash, live in the studio.</i>

24:57.393 --> 24:59.645
We've just been on telly, lads.

24:59.812 --> 25:02.440
So is Tony Wilson a fan,
then, or what?

25:02.607 --> 25:04.066
That was bollocks.

25:05.109 --> 25:07.570
He didn't even say if he liked it
or anything.

25:07.737 --> 25:10.698
- 'Course he liked it.
- Well, how do you know?

25:12.700 --> 25:15.578
He waved it
in front of camera like that.

25:15.745 --> 25:18.873
Forget the record.
He's got to put us on.

25:26.589 --> 25:27.882
Hiya.

25:28.049 --> 25:29.509
There he is.

25:30.843 --> 25:33.471
Um, just orange juice, please.

25:33.638 --> 25:35.223
Go on, tell him.

25:43.022 --> 25:44.357
OK, how are you?

25:44.524 --> 25:47.193
You're gonna go out there,
it's all gonna be fine.

25:50.154 --> 25:52.657
You're not up there having a wank, OK?

25:52.824 --> 25:54.283
Think.

26:00.122 --> 26:03.543
You're a twat, you are.
You're a bastard.

26:03.709 --> 26:04.836
Am I? Why is that?

26:05.002 --> 26:07.213
Because you haven't
put us on television.

26:09.423 --> 26:13.010
Well, then, you'll be the next band
I'll put on, darling.

26:14.470 --> 26:17.223
Fuckin' right we're going on
before your band, twat!

26:17.390 --> 26:19.559
Your band ain't even
a real fuckin' band.

26:19.725 --> 26:21.894
- Fuck off.
- Hooky'll do your head in.

26:22.061 --> 26:23.938
Fuck off!

27:19.452 --> 27:22.580
That was superb, that, lads.
It really was.

27:23.331 --> 27:25.374
I've not seen a reaction like that

27:25.541 --> 27:28.461
since George Best got kicked out
for blasting a bouncer.

27:28.628 --> 27:30.755
I know how you can be better...
like that.

27:32.089 --> 27:34.842
- Go on, then.
- Simple. You employ me.

27:35.009 --> 27:36.677
You play, I manage.

27:36.844 --> 27:40.598
We all get stinkin' rich and go buy
fuckin' great big houses in Cheshire.

27:40.765 --> 27:42.558
- Job's a good 'un.
- And who are you?

27:42.725 --> 27:45.144
Rob Gretton. I already manage
a couple of bands.

27:45.311 --> 27:48.105
But they couldn't sniff the sweat
round your bollocks.

27:48.272 --> 27:50.650
You lot are somethin' else.
I hold my hands up.

27:50.817 --> 27:53.653
I am a believer in Joy Division.
Fuckin' hallelujah.

27:53.820 --> 27:55.863
I'm also resident DJ here,

27:56.030 --> 27:59.659
which means I know anyone of any
music biz use anywhere in this city.

27:59.826 --> 28:03.287
I'll have you lot signed within
the month. In fact, I guarantee it.

28:03.454 --> 28:05.915
We've already got a manager,
haven't we, lads?

28:06.082 --> 28:07.834
- Who's that, then?
- Fuckin' me.

28:08.835 --> 28:10.670
- What's your name, mate?
- Terry.

28:10.837 --> 28:12.296
- Terry what?
- Terry Mason.

28:12.463 --> 28:15.633
Terry Mason. Tez.
You mind if I call you Tez?

28:16.384 --> 28:19.887
Tez, you know jack shit about this
business. Wanna know how I know?

28:20.054 --> 28:21.848
'Cause I haven't heard of you.

28:22.014 --> 28:25.101
I bet you haven't even got
a fuckin' telephone, have you?

28:26.102 --> 28:28.104
Didn't think so. How will you book gigs

28:28.271 --> 28:30.565
and cut deals without a phone,
you daft cunt?

28:30.731 --> 28:32.483
No offence. I call everyone that.

28:33.609 --> 28:36.612
Look, I've got to pack up my gig.
Ring me.

29:07.226 --> 29:09.812
Rob's Records, Rob speaking.

29:10.605 --> 29:13.900
All right, Ian. Yeah, good, yeah.

29:19.489 --> 29:21.741
Well, that's fuckin' brilliant, Ian.

29:24.619 --> 29:26.496
Well, I'll speak to you later, then.

29:27.288 --> 29:28.331
Fine, I understand.

29:28.498 --> 29:31.542
But you've got to sign with Factory.
This isn't an issue.

29:31.709 --> 29:35.296
We're a fresh and exciting label,
you're a fresh and exciting band.

29:35.463 --> 29:39.425
And, most importantly, we both fly
the flag for the Republic of Manchester.

29:39.592 --> 29:42.053
- Don't give a fuck about that.
- I'm a royalist.

29:42.220 --> 29:45.097
- And I suppose they're Nazis as well.
- We're not Nazis.

29:45.264 --> 29:48.059
<i>- What about the money?
- It's 50l50 on the profits.</i>

29:48.226 --> 29:51.687
You own all the publishing rights
and can walk away at any time.

29:51.854 --> 29:54.649
- You serious?
- Rob...

29:54.816 --> 29:57.944
I don't fuck about with talent
I want to work with.

29:58.569 --> 30:02.073
I'll even sign the contracts in my
own blood if it'll make you happy.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.825
We'll speak later, then.

30:06.577 --> 30:10.289
Now remember, we are live,
so no swearing or they will cut you off.

30:10.456 --> 30:12.375
- What about "arse"?
- What?

30:12.542 --> 30:15.837
- Is "arse" a swear word?
- "Arse", yes. It's a swear word.

30:16.003 --> 30:17.797
- No, it's not.
- Bernard,

30:17.964 --> 30:20.800
out there I know
"arse" isn't a swear word.

30:20.967 --> 30:25.513
Here, in TV land,
"arse" is most definitely a swear word.

30:25.680 --> 30:29.058
Trust me, I know
all about swearing and TV.

30:29.225 --> 30:32.436
I'm a master of knowing
when I can and when I can't.

30:32.603 --> 30:35.398
What about "big dog's cock"?
Can you say that?

30:39.402 --> 30:40.611
No.

30:44.240 --> 30:47.160
Seeing as how this is
the first television programme

30:47.326 --> 30:50.204
which brought you the
first appearances from everyone

30:50.371 --> 30:53.249
from The Beatles to the Buzzcocks,
we like to think we bring you

30:53.416 --> 30:56.294
the most new and interesting sounds
in the North-West.

30:56.461 --> 30:58.921
They're called Joy Division,
a Manchester band

30:59.088 --> 31:03.259
except for the guitarist who comes from
Salford. A very important distinction.

31:03.426 --> 31:04.969
<i>This is called Transmission.</i>

33:56.557 --> 33:58.434
I can't believe you did it.

34:00.728 --> 34:02.730
Must have lost about half a pint.

34:02.897 --> 34:04.899
Shows he's serious, though.

34:05.066 --> 34:07.985
How you feelin', Tony?

34:08.152 --> 34:10.237
I've felt better.

34:10.822 --> 34:14.617
Hold on. You spelled Morriss wrong.
It's supposed to be double S.

34:14.784 --> 34:18.036
Tony, you're gonna have to add
another S to this, kid.

34:18.204 --> 34:19.288
Do I have to?

34:19.455 --> 34:23.000
It's not very professional to spell
the drummer's name wrong, is it?

34:37.931 --> 34:40.016
Job's a good 'un. Thanks, Tony.

34:41.768 --> 34:43.396
So...

34:44.272 --> 34:46.482
...I can officially announce
to the press

34:46.649 --> 34:48.693
Joy Division have signed with Factory?

34:48.860 --> 34:52.487
Can you fuck? I'll give you a ring
and arrange a proper meeting Monday.

34:56.951 --> 34:59.203
Bit of a drama queen, isn't he?

35:17.638 --> 35:19.140
Ian...

35:21.559 --> 35:23.186
...please come to bed.

35:33.571 --> 35:36.073
Right, Geoff, well,
there's your reference.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.700
Thank you.

35:42.830 --> 35:45.333
- That's fine.
- Well, good luck with it.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.543
Thank you very much.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.504
We are gonna be late, you know.

35:49.670 --> 35:51.339
All right?

35:55.426 --> 35:57.970
- What's up?
- Bloody dying with the flu.

35:58.137 --> 36:00.139
He's all right,
just a bit of a sniffle.

36:00.306 --> 36:03.309
He's fuckin' scared of playing
London for the first time.

36:03.476 --> 36:04.977
Chocks away.

37:10.251 --> 37:12.128
Well, that was shit.

37:12.295 --> 37:14.839
First gig in London,
there's nobody there.

37:15.715 --> 37:17.758
And now I'm freezing.

37:19.385 --> 37:20.928
I told you it's broke.

37:21.095 --> 37:24.348
Well, you're probably just too thick
to work it properly.

37:24.515 --> 37:27.059
It's a heater, Ian.
You turn it on and it heats up.

37:27.226 --> 37:29.729
And that one doesn't, 'cause it's broke.

37:36.152 --> 37:38.321
Give us a go on your sleeping bag.

37:39.197 --> 37:42.325
- I'm dying here.
- Ten minutes. I'll give you it back.

37:42.492 --> 37:45.536
- No.
- Don't be so spoilt.

37:45.703 --> 37:48.247
- I'm not. I'm dying!
- You've got a little cold

37:48.414 --> 37:50.124
and that's it, babyface!

37:50.291 --> 37:52.376
- Hey!
- Fuck off!

37:52.543 --> 37:56.172
- Pack it in, the pair of you.
- Ten minutes, I'll give it back!

37:56.339 --> 37:57.965
I'm gonna crash the bloody car.

37:59.091 --> 38:02.220
- Ian, you fuckin' menk!
- Ian, calm it, mate!

38:02.386 --> 38:05.348
Fuckin' hell.

38:05.515 --> 38:07.517
Pull over. Steve, pull over.

38:15.233 --> 38:17.443
Hooky, quick, quick, give us a hand.

38:17.610 --> 38:20.363
Yeah, I've got his knees.

38:24.283 --> 38:26.077
Fuckin' hell.

38:30.289 --> 38:32.875
Ian, what's up with you, mate?

38:35.169 --> 38:37.964
Fuck, I thought he was just
trying to warm himself up.

38:38.965 --> 38:40.716
This isn't right, this, Rob.

38:57.150 --> 39:00.361
- What's the story, then?
- He's had some kind of fit.

39:01.320 --> 39:04.240
Oh, right. They're clever,
these doctors, aren't they?

39:04.407 --> 39:08.035
- What kind?
- Epilepsy. They're not sure.

39:09.203 --> 39:12.165
I thought epilepsy
was only for head-the-balls.

39:12.331 --> 39:16.252
- What?
- Head-the-balls. Spaccas.

39:16.419 --> 39:18.504
Nice, Hooky, nice.

39:20.173 --> 39:23.551
- So is he gonna be all right?
- He's not said a lot.

39:23.718 --> 39:25.761
Well, if he were chatty we'd be worried.

39:31.100 --> 39:34.312
We'll try you on...
carbamazepine...

39:35.605 --> 39:41.110
...phenytoin,
tiagabine and oxcarbazipine,

39:41.277 --> 39:46.908
to be taken with the, uh, phenobarbital
that they gave you at the hospital.

39:47.074 --> 39:49.785
In the meantime you'll be
on the waiting list to see

39:49.952 --> 39:52.705
a neurologist specialist
at Macclesfield General.

39:53.498 --> 39:56.209
You should also be getting
plenty of early nights

39:56.375 --> 39:58.753
and steering away from alcohol.

40:04.383 --> 40:07.094
It's a matter of trial and error

40:07.261 --> 40:10.515
until the right drug or
combination of drugs is found.

40:10.681 --> 40:13.601
Some might work.

40:19.065 --> 40:22.193
And... are there any side effects?

40:29.659 --> 40:34.205
Carbamazepine's side effects
include skin rash,

40:35.248 --> 40:37.667
double vision, drowsiness, dizziness,

40:37.834 --> 40:40.670
gastric disturbances...
That means farting.

40:41.420 --> 40:46.008
Phenytoin's side effects
include drowsiness,

40:46.175 --> 40:48.886
acne, overgrowth of the gums,

40:49.053 --> 40:52.223
nausea, vomiting, mental confusion,

40:52.390 --> 40:55.059
mental slowing. That's it.

41:04.610 --> 41:07.029
Ian, you're
gonna be late for work.

41:15.538 --> 41:16.831
Ian?

41:20.960 --> 41:22.837
Ian.

41:26.048 --> 41:29.177
Uh, I'm sorry, Earnest.
I must have drifted off.

41:29.343 --> 41:32.472
You all right?

41:34.056 --> 41:35.766
It's these tablets.

41:36.976 --> 41:39.604
Yeah, well, them and
the late night concerts, eh?

41:40.730 --> 41:42.648
Listen, um...

41:42.815 --> 41:46.110
I'm not sure you can do
both jobs, Ian,

41:46.277 --> 41:49.780
so just have a little think
about it, yeah?

41:49.947 --> 41:54.285
As your supervisor I do need you
to have a think about it, all right?

41:54.744 --> 41:56.204
Yeah.

42:21.229 --> 42:23.564
Hello, is Corrine there, please?

42:24.732 --> 42:27.235
It's Ian Curtis from
the Employment Exchange.

42:27.401 --> 42:29.862
I was just wondering how she'd been...

42:32.114 --> 42:33.741
What?

42:34.534 --> 42:35.993
Just like that?

42:38.955 --> 42:40.706
From having a fit?

42:41.749 --> 42:43.709
I didn't know that could...

42:45.419 --> 42:48.714
Oh. I'm so, so sorry.

43:13.739 --> 43:16.576
Ian, love,
I'm going to bed now.

43:17.827 --> 43:19.454
Are you comin'?

45:12.608 --> 45:14.068
All right?

45:14.777 --> 45:18.906
Hi. They wouldn't let me in.
My name weren't on the guest list.

45:19.073 --> 45:20.116
I didn't know.

45:20.283 --> 45:22.827
Somebody should've.
It's bloody embarrassing.

45:22.994 --> 45:25.455
No, I didn't know you were pregnant.

45:55.443 --> 45:57.028
- Hiya.
- All right, Debbie?

45:57.195 --> 45:59.697
- Where's Ian?
- Congratulations.

46:01.449 --> 46:04.660
Oh, don't look so shocked, Rob.
It's been comin' a long time.

46:22.637 --> 46:24.180
Hiya.

46:24.972 --> 46:26.766
What are you doing here?

46:30.019 --> 46:32.772
- She's a mate of Hooky's.
- Right.

46:32.939 --> 46:36.150
Hi. I'm Ian's wife.

46:37.735 --> 46:39.195
Hi.

46:42.114 --> 46:45.243
Do you think it's right for you
to be out in your condition?

46:58.673 --> 46:59.924
Ian.

47:21.988 --> 47:23.573
Ian.

47:23.739 --> 47:26.117
Come on, into the pain.

47:26.284 --> 47:28.411
Keep going...
I've got the head, Debbie.

47:28.578 --> 47:30.746
Well done, well done. One last time.

47:30.913 --> 47:32.290
- One last time.
- I can't.

47:32.457 --> 47:34.333
Go on. Yes, you can,
you can, you can.

47:34.500 --> 47:38.004
Good girl. Well done.

47:40.840 --> 47:42.467
Good. That's great.

47:42.633 --> 47:45.011
Here we are. That's right.

47:47.096 --> 47:50.224
Ah, here we are. It's a girl.

47:51.517 --> 47:53.603
Ohh!

47:54.228 --> 47:57.064
Congratulations.

47:57.231 --> 47:58.483
Mum and Dad.

48:07.241 --> 48:09.786
Hello. Hello.

48:09.952 --> 48:11.662
Hey.

48:14.624 --> 48:16.083
I need a cig.

49:26.571 --> 49:28.489
Silklands Nightclub.

49:29.448 --> 49:31.200
Part-time barmaid.

49:31.784 --> 49:33.536
One pound ten an hour.

49:33.703 --> 49:36.122
Mum and Dad can look after Natalie.

49:39.333 --> 49:41.210
What do you think?

49:44.755 --> 49:46.299
Well, it won't be for long.

49:47.425 --> 49:50.386
I'll take care of you as soon
as the new album comes out.

51:36.993 --> 51:39.537
Well, what happened
to that tenner I gave you?

51:48.212 --> 51:50.923
Well, my wages are the same
as everyone else's.

51:57.680 --> 52:00.683
Talk to Ian, you know. Find out.

52:00.850 --> 52:02.310
OK.

52:03.853 --> 52:06.856
- No promises.
- All right, I'll ask him.

52:08.024 --> 52:09.484
Look, I've gotta go.

52:10.985 --> 52:13.237
Give Natalie a kiss for me.

52:16.282 --> 52:17.742
I love you too.

52:26.876 --> 52:28.085
Not bad, eh?

52:28.961 --> 52:32.548
The journalist makes us out to be
a bunch of pricks. Who gives a fuck?

52:32.715 --> 52:34.967
A bunch of cool pricks,
that's what I say.

52:35.843 --> 52:38.262
- Who's that?
- Some French bird.

52:38.429 --> 52:39.806
Wants to do an interview.

52:40.681 --> 52:43.559
She's not a Frenchy.
She's, uh, she's a Belgy.

52:43.726 --> 52:46.103
- What did you tell her?
- I said I'd ask,

52:46.270 --> 52:48.523
but it's unlikely to happen now.

52:48.689 --> 52:51.901
It's only a crappy European fanzine.

52:52.068 --> 52:55.112
Well, I'm all right.
Why don't we do it tonight?

52:56.614 --> 52:59.117
We can invite her back
to where we're staying.

53:00.576 --> 53:02.787
- What's her name?
- Annik.

53:02.954 --> 53:06.916
Annik. Different.

53:07.083 --> 53:08.668
It's foreign.

53:11.629 --> 53:13.256
I'll have a word, boss.

53:14.257 --> 53:16.217
<i>Annik? Hola.</i>

53:26.769 --> 53:28.855
Come on, then. Let's have it.

53:35.194 --> 53:37.780
OK.

53:37.947 --> 53:41.367
OK, so, um...
Do you like the Buzzcocks?

53:44.120 --> 53:45.788
They're a good laugh.

53:45.955 --> 53:49.417
Yeah, they're all right,
apart from the "cocks" bit.

53:53.337 --> 53:55.381
There you go.

53:55.548 --> 53:58.843
What is the most beautiful thing
you've seen in your life?

54:00.720 --> 54:04.265
I saw a beautiful drum kit down at
Johnny Roadhouse's shop once.

54:07.310 --> 54:09.937
What about music?
Is that beautiful?

54:10.104 --> 54:12.190
Some of it.

54:14.108 --> 54:16.068
What about Joy Division's music?

54:16.235 --> 54:18.613
Some of it, yeah, but...

54:18.779 --> 54:21.365
...some of it's
not meant to be beautiful.

54:26.954 --> 54:30.208
Does anyone believe in love?

54:30.374 --> 54:35.755
I believe in pure... sex.

54:38.174 --> 54:40.218
I believe in feeling, yeah.

54:41.761 --> 54:43.304
What does that mean?

54:45.389 --> 54:47.475
You know, like if I had a car,

54:47.642 --> 54:50.394
and I felt love for the car
and somebody kicked my car.

54:50.561 --> 54:53.940
I'd be as upset as if
they kicked my girlfriend.

55:01.531 --> 55:03.825
So you're not a journalist, then?

55:03.991 --> 55:06.577
It's a hobby thing, not a full-time job.

55:08.329 --> 55:12.041
I work for the Belgian embassy,
for the chancellor.

55:12.750 --> 55:14.836
Sounds interesting.

55:16.045 --> 55:18.214
Free, independent woman.

55:19.423 --> 55:21.509
I suppose so, yes.

55:29.350 --> 55:31.602
Tell me about Macclesfield.

55:34.147 --> 55:37.525
It's grey, it's miserable.

55:39.861 --> 55:42.029
I've wanted to escape it my whole life.

55:48.995 --> 55:50.746
What about your wife?

55:53.166 --> 55:55.126
She loves it in Macclesfield.

56:02.633 --> 56:04.886
You were married so young.

56:05.678 --> 56:08.473
I've never heard of people
marrying so young.

56:09.140 --> 56:10.933
Yeah, I know.

56:17.064 --> 56:19.484
My marriage was a mistake.

56:32.538 --> 56:35.124
Are you tired?

58:51.969 --> 58:54.597
Ian?

59:01.562 --> 59:02.605
Ian?

59:28.923 --> 59:30.758
What time are they coming for you?

59:32.051 --> 59:33.427
Half an hour.

59:33.886 --> 59:35.972
Right. I'm gonna nip to the shop.

59:36.139 --> 59:37.765
Back in a minute, OK?

01:00:17.054 --> 01:00:18.931
You got your passport, Ian?

01:00:23.311 --> 01:00:25.521
Up the continental in the rental.
Come on.

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:04.936
Fresh air.

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.438
All right, love?

01:01:09.273 --> 01:01:10.316
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:10.483 --> 01:01:11.776
Hiya.

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:17.490
I'll get in the back this time.

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:53.609
Hi, Debbie.

01:02:18.384 --> 01:02:20.803
I must have been out
when you called.

01:02:21.387 --> 01:02:24.056
It was hard to get to a phone.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:33.065
Come on, girl. Yeah.

01:02:33.232 --> 01:02:36.152
Come on, girl.

01:02:44.702 --> 01:02:47.121
Did you remember to take your pills?

01:02:47.288 --> 01:02:48.664
Yeah.

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:54.337
Are they working?

01:02:56.422 --> 01:02:58.299
I had an attack in Berlin.

01:02:58.633 --> 01:03:01.093
Oh, Ian, if they're not working

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:05.056
we need to get you a doctor's
appointment to change the medication.

01:03:10.937 --> 01:03:13.105
We really missed you.

01:03:20.238 --> 01:03:22.740
Oh, there's this girl at work
called Claire,

01:03:22.907 --> 01:03:26.035
and, uh, she's invited us
to her flat warming party.

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:27.912
Hasn't she?

01:03:28.079 --> 01:03:31.749
And I said, um, that we'd go. 'Cause
Mum and Dad can look after Natalie.

01:03:31.916 --> 01:03:34.043
That way we get a lie in. Don't we?

01:03:38.131 --> 01:03:41.634
Daddy. Daddy's home.

01:03:41.801 --> 01:03:43.678
- Do you like the Buzzcocks?
- Yeah.

01:03:43.845 --> 01:03:45.680
We're on tour with them as well.

01:03:45.847 --> 01:03:49.267
Don't know what you were
worried about. He fits in fine.

01:03:49.433 --> 01:03:53.688
But he can seem a bit distant
to people he don't know. Trust me.

01:03:56.023 --> 01:03:58.109
Do you trust him when he's away?

01:03:58.276 --> 01:04:02.613
- You know, with other girls.
- Totally.

01:04:05.199 --> 01:04:09.036
He's so protective, you know.
He hates me wearing short skirts.

01:04:10.037 --> 01:04:11.998
Goes mad if I talk to other blokes.

01:04:14.208 --> 01:04:16.711
He is quite famous now,
though, isn't he?

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:19.005
Not to me.

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:21.966
I still wash his underpants.

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:30.183
Do you want to sleep with other men?

01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:31.726
What?

01:04:31.893 --> 01:04:34.103
Do you want to sleep with other men?

01:04:36.856 --> 01:04:38.941
That's a strange question.

01:04:40.526 --> 01:04:43.529
Because... if you did...

01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:46.407
...it'd be OK.

01:04:48.326 --> 01:04:49.786
I'd be OK.

01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:53.706
Are you being serious?

01:04:57.543 --> 01:05:01.464
When you say a thing like that it makes
me think you don't love me anymore.

01:05:04.425 --> 01:05:06.302
I don't think I do.

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:11.093
<i> Belgian Embassy.</i>

01:07:13.346 --> 01:07:15.097
Hello, um...

01:07:16.682 --> 01:07:20.228
Can I speak with Annik Honore, please?

01:07:20.394 --> 01:07:21.979
<i>One moment.</i>

01:07:25.691 --> 01:07:27.777
<i>Annik Honore, bonjour.</i>

01:07:34.826 --> 01:07:38.329
Steve! Hey, kill it! Kill it!

01:07:38.496 --> 01:07:40.289
Kill it, kill it.

01:07:41.874 --> 01:07:44.043
- Something's up.
- What?

01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:46.587
Rob's got one of his cheesy grins
going again.

01:07:46.754 --> 01:07:49.173
You've been spending our wages,
Rob, or what?

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:52.009
Come on, then,
you twisted bastard, out with it.

01:07:53.052 --> 01:07:56.764
It's all happenin', boys.
Pack your bags, saddle up.

01:07:56.931 --> 01:08:00.768
Nineteenth of May we're off to the
US of fuckin' A for a two-week tour.

01:08:02.728 --> 01:08:05.398
- You're joking?
- We're gonna be contenders.

01:08:06.357 --> 01:08:08.109
We're gonna be somebodies.

01:08:09.110 --> 01:08:10.570
How'd you wangle that one?

01:08:10.736 --> 01:08:13.781
I put a lackey band
around Tony's cock and balls.

01:08:13.948 --> 01:08:15.199
Did it drop off?

01:08:16.075 --> 01:08:18.703
I thought we'd celebrate.
Bring them here, Terry.

01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:20.246
Nice one.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.057
What are you doing in here?

01:08:41.809 --> 01:08:43.519
Who's Annik?

01:09:03.456 --> 01:09:04.749
Eh?

01:09:06.834 --> 01:09:08.752
How long have you been seeing her?

01:09:15.009 --> 01:09:18.386
Answer me, Ian! Don't ignore me!

01:09:24.644 --> 01:09:26.187
Eh?

01:09:27.939 --> 01:09:30.108
How long have you been seeing her?

01:09:39.325 --> 01:09:40.868
Do you love her?

01:09:45.957 --> 01:09:47.416
Do you love her, Ian?

01:09:58.010 --> 01:10:00.346
I love you.

01:10:01.305 --> 01:10:03.391
I really, really love you.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:17.155
No one loves you like me.
No one.

01:10:22.326 --> 01:10:25.079
Just answer me, Ian!
Please answer me!

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:35.214
I don't deserve this.

01:10:36.257 --> 01:10:37.884
I don't deserve this.

01:11:02.241 --> 01:11:03.701
Fuckin' hell.

01:11:40.279 --> 01:11:42.115
Sorry, Debbie.

01:11:46.285 --> 01:11:47.829
I owe you everything.

01:11:52.458 --> 01:11:54.168
I love you.

01:11:59.257 --> 01:12:00.800
What does that mean?

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:06.430
I'll finish with her.

01:12:09.225 --> 01:12:10.685
Please.

01:12:29.036 --> 01:12:30.580
<i> London Euston.</i>

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:34.709
<i>The next train to arrive
at platform six.</i>

01:12:34.876 --> 01:12:37.837
- Eh-up. You all right, love?
- Hello.

01:12:38.004 --> 01:12:40.006
- Good to see you.
- Hello, love.

01:12:40.173 --> 01:12:41.966
- Hello. Hi.
- All right?

01:13:04.822 --> 01:13:06.741
Steve, go and turn the heating off.

01:13:06.908 --> 01:13:08.743
I wanna get it colder in here.

01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:16.375
Will you two twats
get the fuck out of my studio?

01:13:18.044 --> 01:13:20.296
- All right.
- Go on, fuck off.

01:14:12.098 --> 01:14:13.808
Got it, Ian. It's good.

01:14:16.102 --> 01:14:18.062
It's fuckin' genius, actually.

<i> Hello?</i>

01:14:37.457 --> 01:14:39.250

Fuckin' hell!

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.166
Twinny, come on, give us a hand.

01:17:25.792 --> 01:17:29.587
Come on, take him your way.
Take him your way.

01:17:38.137 --> 01:17:40.681
Here, Twinny, get him some water.

01:17:51.692 --> 01:17:55.404
We're Joy Division, you're the crowd.
Good night. God bless.

01:17:59.492 --> 01:18:02.787
- Was it a bad one?
- You've had worse.

01:18:04.622 --> 01:18:06.541
Did Annik see?

01:18:06.707 --> 01:18:08.251
Everyone saw.

01:18:08.876 --> 01:18:11.712
That was superb, that, Ian, mate.

01:18:11.879 --> 01:18:13.714
You played a fuckin' blinder.

01:18:13.881 --> 01:18:15.591
Who won the fight, Ian or Ian?

01:18:15.758 --> 01:18:17.552
It's like Ian knocked Ian out to me.

01:18:17.718 --> 01:18:20.096
Twatted himself
with a right good uppercut.

01:18:24.183 --> 01:18:27.436
- Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant.
- Girls, girls, not now.

01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:29.981
Hang on. Come with me.
Come with the Hookster.

01:18:30.148 --> 01:18:32.316
I'll show you my...

01:18:40.324 --> 01:18:42.827
I'll go find Gillian.

01:18:52.336 --> 01:18:54.380
Taking your medication?

01:18:55.465 --> 01:18:57.091
For what it's worth.

01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:01.179
Chin up. Could be worse.

01:19:01.345 --> 01:19:03.389
Could be the lead singer in The Fall.

01:19:22.033 --> 01:19:23.367
Ian.

01:19:23.534 --> 01:19:26.370
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:19:30.917 --> 01:19:33.920
- I'm so sorry.
- I had a fit.

01:19:34.086 --> 01:19:35.630
I'm all right now.

01:19:56.025 --> 01:19:59.320

<i>- Hello?

01:20:32.562 --> 01:20:34.313
Hi.

01:20:46.409 --> 01:20:48.995
Ian, you are so depressing.

01:21:02.925 --> 01:21:05.261
I'm so happy to sit with you here.

01:21:09.432 --> 01:21:10.683
Me too.

01:21:21.778 --> 01:21:23.488
I don't know what to say.

01:21:29.243 --> 01:21:31.662
I never felt this way before.

01:21:36.793 --> 01:21:38.795
But...

01:21:38.961 --> 01:21:41.631
...at the same time I feel like

01:21:41.798 --> 01:21:44.884
I don't really know
anything about you, and...

01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:49.180
...you don't know me, and...

01:21:55.561 --> 01:21:57.313
Well, what do you want to know?

01:22:05.488 --> 01:22:07.615
Tell me your favourite movie.

01:22:12.328 --> 01:22:17.083
<i>I really like... The Sound of Music.</i>

01:22:20.002 --> 01:22:22.839
- What?
- Nothing.

01:22:26.759 --> 01:22:30.138
- Anything else?
- Your favourite colour.

01:22:30.304 --> 01:22:32.473
Mine is purple.

01:22:33.724 --> 01:22:37.019
Blue. Man City blue.

01:22:38.771 --> 01:22:40.606
What is Man City blue?

01:22:42.066 --> 01:22:44.652
Well, Man City is a football club.

01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:47.530
And they wear blue.

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:05.006
Ian...

01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:12.555
I'm a little scared.

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.933
Scared of what?

01:23:19.437 --> 01:23:21.689
Scared of falling in love with you.

01:24:19.455 --> 01:24:21.165
Hiya.

01:24:23.042 --> 01:24:24.919
I'm so glad you're home.

01:24:26.337 --> 01:24:28.047
I'll make you a cup of tea.

01:25:37.575 --> 01:25:39.744
I don't want to hurt you, Debbie.

01:25:45.082 --> 01:25:46.459
Ian?

01:25:49.504 --> 01:25:50.922
Come to bed, eh?

01:25:54.675 --> 01:25:58.679
- Taken my pills.
- Ian?

01:26:16.864 --> 01:26:18.616

01:27:10.668 --> 01:27:14.297
Mr Curtis, I am here to tell you
that you are well enough to leave,

01:27:14.464 --> 01:27:17.008
but you must get some rest
for several days.

01:27:17.175 --> 01:27:20.761
Just be aware that your condition
is extremely weak at the moment.

01:27:21.679 --> 01:27:23.973
But I am discharging you.

01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:25.600
Thank you.

01:27:32.482 --> 01:27:33.941
Well, that's that, then.

01:27:38.738 --> 01:27:40.990
<i> I don't want to be
in the band anymore.</i>

01:27:41.157 --> 01:27:43.576
<i>Unknown Pleasures was it.</i>

01:27:44.786 --> 01:27:46.496
<i>I was happy.</i>

01:27:47.914 --> 01:27:50.708
<i>I never meant for it to grow like this.</i>

01:27:51.250 --> 01:27:53.920
<i>When I'm up there, singing...</i>

01:27:55.213 --> 01:27:57.882
<i>... they don't understand
how much I give.</i>

01:27:58.716 --> 01:28:00.510
<i>And how it affects me.</i>

01:28:01.469 --> 01:28:03.554
Panic's over. He's here.

01:28:04.972 --> 01:28:06.432
<i>Now they want more.</i>

01:28:06.599 --> 01:28:09.727
<i>- They expect me to give more.
- Just enjoy yourself.</i>

01:28:11.979 --> 01:28:13.815
<i>And I don't know if I can.</i>

01:28:16.692 --> 01:28:19.362
<i>It's like it's not happening to me,</i>

01:28:19.529 --> 01:28:23.407
<i>but... someone pretending to be me,</i>

01:28:23.574 --> 01:28:25.660
<i>someone dressed in my skin.</i>

01:28:28.162 --> 01:28:30.248
<i>Now we're going to America.</i>

01:28:34.418 --> 01:28:36.295
<i>I have no control anymore.</i>

01:28:40.842 --> 01:28:42.301
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

01:28:46.055 --> 01:28:48.474
I was pissed.

01:29:02.738 --> 01:29:03.781
You're on.

01:29:14.375 --> 01:29:17.670
- I need a few minutes.
- What?

01:29:27.263 --> 01:29:31.392
Go and get Alan from Crispy Ambulance,
and fuckin' hurry up.

01:29:36.731 --> 01:29:37.982
I'm sorry.

01:29:40.067 --> 01:29:43.613
Take as long as you need.
How long do you need?

01:29:50.536 --> 01:29:52.705
You know the words to our songs,
don't you?

01:29:52.872 --> 01:29:54.373
- Most of them. What?
- Get on.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.879
<i>First two tracks, Disorder, Colony,
till Ian feels better. Twenty quid.</i>

01:30:00.046 --> 01:30:02.423
- Serious?
- I look like I'm fucking jokin'?

01:30:18.731 --> 01:30:19.941
Off! Off! Off!

01:30:20.108 --> 01:30:21.984
Shit!

01:30:22.151 --> 01:30:24.153
You all right, Ian, mate?

01:30:29.534 --> 01:30:30.993
Ready to go on?

01:30:31.619 --> 01:30:34.330
Ian! Ian! Ian! Ian!

01:30:34.497 --> 01:30:36.833
Ian, talk to me.

01:30:39.127 --> 01:30:41.003
- OK.
- OK.

01:31:01.274 --> 01:31:04.193
<i>- Where's my 20 quid?
- In my "fuck off" pocket.</i>

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:39.645
Twenty quid. Go on.

01:31:39.812 --> 01:31:41.105
I want 50.

01:31:42.190 --> 01:31:43.649
You fucker.

01:31:54.702 --> 01:31:56.746
Get Hooky off the stage now!

01:32:05.296 --> 01:32:07.381
Get off! Fuckin' get off!

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.926
You, you fucker!

01:32:10.092 --> 01:32:12.011
Get the fuck out!

01:32:22.230 --> 01:32:24.023
I don't get it, Ian.

01:32:24.190 --> 01:32:27.068
I don't get why you're
doing this to yourself.

01:32:28.069 --> 01:32:30.947
- It's all coming apart.
- No, it's all coming together.

01:32:31.114 --> 01:32:34.033
Tonight was great.
It'll go down in history.

01:32:36.327 --> 01:32:38.996
You remember Lou Reed
at the Free Trade Hall?

01:32:39.622 --> 01:32:41.916
- The riot?
- That's right, the fuckin' riot.

01:32:42.083 --> 01:32:43.709
Best gig I've ever been to.

01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:50.216
It all used to be so simple,
everything.

01:32:51.634 --> 01:32:54.762
Now everyone hates me.
I've made everyone hate me.

01:32:54.929 --> 01:32:56.389
No one hates you.

01:32:56.556 --> 01:32:59.100
- Even the people who love me hate me.
- Debbie?

01:32:59.267 --> 01:33:01.561
- And Natalie.
- How can Natalie hate you?

01:33:01.727 --> 01:33:05.523
- For Christ's sake.
- She will, though. I know she will.

01:33:06.399 --> 01:33:07.859
You're a good dad, Ian.

01:33:08.025 --> 01:33:11.404
No, Tony, I'm not. I know I'm not.

01:33:11.571 --> 01:33:15.783
If I was a good dad,
then I wouldn't be doing all... this.

01:33:18.119 --> 01:33:22.373
And what about Annik?
She loves you. You love her.

01:33:25.418 --> 01:33:27.837
- I hate her.
- And you love her.

01:33:32.717 --> 01:33:34.844
You can't pin all that on us.

01:33:35.011 --> 01:33:37.263
We didn't start the fuckin' riot.

01:33:40.099 --> 01:33:42.602
Mate, you're pissing up
the wrong tree here.

01:33:42.769 --> 01:33:45.521
You think I owe you money
for the damages? Guess what?

01:33:45.688 --> 01:33:48.357
I don't. So shut the fuck up
and start suing,

01:33:48.524 --> 01:33:52.028
'cause that's the only way you're
gonna get a fuckin' bean out of me.

01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:54.697
Wanker.

01:33:55.323 --> 01:33:58.451
Who the fuck...?

01:34:02.455 --> 01:34:05.041
<i>- Hello.
- It's Ian.</i>

01:34:14.592 --> 01:34:17.970
Oh, fuckin' shine a light!
Aren't you in enough trouble?

01:34:21.307 --> 01:34:23.726
- We need somewhere to stay.
- Try a hotel.

01:34:23.893 --> 01:34:27.146
I'm skint, and you still
owe me some money.

01:34:27.313 --> 01:34:30.942
Fuckin' hell! Have I got Barclays
tattooed on my forehead?

01:34:32.235 --> 01:34:33.444
Get in.

01:34:42.036 --> 01:34:44.038
Tea's in the pot, bedroom's in there.

01:34:44.205 --> 01:34:45.957
Spare noddys in the drawer.

01:34:46.124 --> 01:34:47.375
Is this a bad time?

01:34:47.542 --> 01:34:50.211
No! I'm just in the mood
for a desperate social call

01:34:50.378 --> 01:34:53.256
from you and Joan of Arc.

01:34:54.841 --> 01:34:56.300
Yes?

01:34:57.593 --> 01:34:59.595
Debbie! Great!

01:34:59.762 --> 01:35:03.724
And what the fuck can I do for you?
Need some money, a place to crash?

01:35:03.891 --> 01:35:06.060
Fuckin' lightbulb need changin'?

01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:10.022
And you don't know where he is.

01:35:10.731 --> 01:35:12.150
<i>Quelle surprise.</i>

01:35:14.986 --> 01:35:17.071
Something about Derby?

01:35:17.864 --> 01:35:20.992
Well, it's nice to know you two
are talking properly again.

01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:25.496
Listen, Debbie,
I don't know where the fuck he is.

01:35:25.663 --> 01:35:27.790
As usual, I know fuck all.

01:35:29.083 --> 01:35:30.293
Don't I?

01:35:32.628 --> 01:35:34.380
Don't I?

01:35:34.547 --> 01:35:38.134
Rob, who are you talking to?

01:35:46.517 --> 01:35:47.852
Ian.

01:35:49.395 --> 01:35:51.105
What, he's there with you?

01:35:55.401 --> 01:35:57.195
Is she with him?

01:35:59.489 --> 01:36:05.369
Yeah. We're all here.
One big fuckin' happy family.

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.837
She wants a divorce.

01:36:23.805 --> 01:36:25.389
You can sleep here.

01:36:29.977 --> 01:36:32.063
Stay as long as you like, Ian.

01:36:39.195 --> 01:36:41.697
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

01:37:05.972 --> 01:37:09.725
Ian? I've got an idea.

01:37:12.228 --> 01:37:15.314
I've been studying hypnosis.

01:37:44.343 --> 01:37:45.636
<i> Ian?</i>

01:37:46.804 --> 01:37:48.890
<i>Let me in, love.</i>

01:37:50.475 --> 01:37:52.393
<i>Just want to talk.</i>

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:56.939
<i> You're mine. Irretrievably.</i>

01:37:58.191 --> 01:38:00.151
<i> I'm a little scared.</i>

01:38:01.652 --> 01:38:03.988
<i>Scared of falling in love with you.</i>

01:38:04.530 --> 01:38:06.449
<i> This has to be for good.</i>

01:38:07.450 --> 01:38:09.535
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:14.457
<i>I owe you everything.
I love you. </i>

01:38:14.624 --> 01:38:16.709
<i> What does that mean?</i>

01:38:18.503 --> 01:38:20.838
<i> I've never felt this way before.</i>

01:38:21.005 --> 01:38:22.757
<i> So it was my life began...</i>

01:38:22.924 --> 01:38:26.260
<i>- I don't deserve this.
- So is it now I am a man</i>

01:38:26.427 --> 01:38:27.845
<i>I didn't do enough.</i>

01:38:28.012 --> 01:38:30.640
<i>So it be you and I shall grow old</i>

01:38:30.807 --> 01:38:32.391
<i>I should have tried harder.</i>

01:38:32.558 --> 01:38:33.768
<i>Or let me die</i>

01:38:36.395 --> 01:38:39.107
<i>And I could wish my days to be</i>

01:38:39.899 --> 01:38:41.984
<i>Bound each to each</i>

01:38:42.151 --> 01:38:44.237
<i>By natural...</i>

01:38:54.914 --> 01:38:56.624
Hi.

01:38:56.791 --> 01:38:58.292
Hi.

01:38:59.961 --> 01:39:01.337
I miss you.

01:39:03.422 --> 01:39:06.717
<i>- Is everything all right?
- I don't know, Annik.</i>

01:39:06.884 --> 01:39:08.219
I don't know.

01:39:09.679 --> 01:39:11.764
<i>It all feels wrong.</i>

01:39:16.018 --> 01:39:18.896
Ian, you are confusing me.

01:39:21.524 --> 01:39:25.319
I know. I know I am.

01:39:32.285 --> 01:39:33.995
<i> Dear Annik,</i>

01:39:35.413 --> 01:39:38.791
<i>I know I'm intruding on your life,
not you on mine.</i>

01:39:39.584 --> 01:39:42.795
<i>I felt as if things were becoming
a bit clearer earlier on,</i>

01:39:42.962 --> 01:39:46.716
<i>but can now see everything
falling to pieces before my eyes.</i>

01:39:49.051 --> 01:39:51.929
<i>I'm paying dearly for past mistakes.</i>

01:39:52.096 --> 01:39:54.891
<i>I never realised how
one mistake in my life</i>

01:39:55.057 --> 01:39:58.853
<i>some four or five years ago
would make me feel how I do.</i>

01:40:02.106 --> 01:40:05.485
<i>I struggle between what I know
is right in my own mind,</i>

01:40:05.651 --> 01:40:09.822
<i>and some warped truthfulness
as seen through other people's eyes</i>

01:40:09.989 --> 01:40:13.242
<i>who have no heart, and
can't see the difference anyway.</i>

01:40:13.409 --> 01:40:15.077
Eh-up, you.

01:40:17.622 --> 01:40:18.831
Come on in.

01:40:18.998 --> 01:40:21.083
<i>I saw Apocalypse Now at the cinema.</i>

01:40:21.250 --> 01:40:23.544
<i>I couldn't take me eyes
away from the screen.</i>

01:40:23.711 --> 01:40:25.463
What you been up to, then, eh?

01:40:25.630 --> 01:40:29.175
<i>On the record, there's Marlon Brando
reading The Hollow Men,</i>

01:40:29.342 --> 01:40:34.514
<i>the struggle between man's conscience
and his heart until things go too far,</i>

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:37.517
<i>get out of hand,
and can never be repaired.</i>

01:40:40.937 --> 01:40:43.523
<i>Is everything so worthless in the end?</i>

01:40:43.689 --> 01:40:45.650
<i>Is there any more?</i>

01:40:45.817 --> 01:40:48.736
<i>What lies beyond?
What is left to carry on?</i>

01:40:48.903 --> 01:40:54.075
Ian, your room's still here.
You know that, don't you?

01:40:54.242 --> 01:40:55.785
I know, Mum.

01:40:58.204 --> 01:40:59.413
Thanks.

01:41:06.546 --> 01:41:09.882
<i> I have the feeling
the epileptic condition will worsen.</i>

01:41:10.049 --> 01:41:12.009
<i>It frightens me.</i>

01:41:14.387 --> 01:41:17.598
<i>It's a lie to say
"I'm not afraid any more".</i>

01:41:18.391 --> 01:41:21.310
<i>There's nothing the doctors can do
but try tablets.</i>

01:41:22.812 --> 01:41:24.439
<i>I felt I had to tell you this</i>

01:41:24.605 --> 01:41:27.400
<i>even though it might change
your feelings for me.</i>

01:41:28.359 --> 01:41:32.613
<i>I've been thinking of you constantly,
trying to rationalise our situation,</i>

01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:34.991
<i>thinking of the things we've done.</i>

01:41:35.158 --> 01:41:37.743
<i>Images and thoughts prey on my mind,</i>

01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:40.621
<i>before my eyes all times
of the day and night.</i>

01:41:41.747 --> 01:41:44.584
<i>And while some things are beyond
my understanding,</i>

01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:47.753
<i>I know that I love you
and will do forever.</i>

01:41:49.464 --> 01:41:53.176
<i>Until I see you again,
I miss you with all my heart.</i>

01:41:54.093 --> 01:41:57.221
<i>All my love... Ian.</i>

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:29.962
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.</i>

01:42:30.129 --> 01:42:33.549
<i>- You all right?
- I'm not coming out tonight.</i>

01:42:33.716 --> 01:42:35.092
<i>Why not?</i>

01:42:36.135 --> 01:42:38.554
I'm gonna go home. Speak to Debbie.

01:42:38.721 --> 01:42:40.681
<i>Does she want to speak to you?</i>

01:42:41.349 --> 01:42:45.103
Dunno. I just feel
the need to speak to her.

01:42:45.269 --> 01:42:47.021
<i>Well, if you're sure.</i>

01:42:47.188 --> 01:42:49.690
I'll see you Monday morning
at the airport.

01:42:49.857 --> 01:42:52.485
<i>- You all ready and packed?
- Not yet.</i>

01:42:52.652 --> 01:42:55.488
<i>I'm not gonna sleep tonight.
I'm like a fuckin'kid.</i>

01:42:55.655 --> 01:42:57.573
Yeah. Same here.

01:42:57.740 --> 01:43:00.827
<i>I've got all my clothes laid out
on my bed and everything.</i>

01:43:03.246 --> 01:43:06.207
<i>- I'll see you Monday.
- Don't be late.</i>

01:43:06.374 --> 01:43:08.960
Don't worry. I'll be there.

01:43:23.599 --> 01:43:25.059
I'm off.

01:43:25.685 --> 01:43:28.104
I'm gonna go meet up
with Debbie tonight.

01:43:54.881 --> 01:43:58.301
<i>Could we have your attention
please, ladies and gentlemen?</i>

01:43:58.468 --> 01:44:01.721
<i>We are ready to begin now
the sale on behalf of our bank</i>

01:44:01.888 --> 01:44:04.932
<i>to disperse the repossessed property</i>

01:44:05.099 --> 01:44:07.351
<i>formerly owned by a Mr Stroszek.</i>

01:44:07.518 --> 01:44:10.062
<i>Colonel Ralph Wade
will be our auctioneer.</i>

01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:14.066
<i>I'll be serving as your clerk.
We're ready to begin with the auction.</i>

01:45:51.664 --> 01:45:53.916
What are you doing here?

01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:57.628
Don't divorce me, Debbie.

01:45:59.714 --> 01:46:01.299
I don't want to lose you.

01:46:03.718 --> 01:46:06.053
It's not that simple, though,
is it, Ian?

01:46:07.972 --> 01:46:10.057
Is this really what you want?

01:46:10.224 --> 01:46:14.103
No. No, I don't.

01:46:16.939 --> 01:46:19.025
But you love someone else.

01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:26.115
What's that got to do with us?

01:46:27.450 --> 01:46:28.826
Everything.

01:46:34.999 --> 01:46:37.043
You can't leave her, can you?

01:46:39.796 --> 01:46:41.547
It's not that easy.

01:46:42.465 --> 01:46:45.468
I've tried. She won't go away.

01:46:50.807 --> 01:46:53.017
Well, then you've made your decision.

01:46:57.522 --> 01:46:58.773
Go on then.

01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:02.068
- What?
- Go on, leave me alone!

01:47:02.235 --> 01:47:03.277
Ian.

01:47:03.444 --> 01:47:06.405
Don't come back until the morning.
I'll be gone by then.

01:47:07.406 --> 01:47:08.866
Get out!

01:49:00.645 --> 01:49:02.730
<i> So this is permanence</i>

01:49:04.023 --> 01:49:06.275
<i>Love shattered pride</i>

01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:09.821
<i>What once was innocence</i>

01:49:09.987 --> 01:49:12.490
<i>Turned on its side</i>

01:49:14.534 --> 01:49:16.786
<i>A cloud hangs over me</i>

01:49:16.953 --> 01:49:19.247
<i>Marks every move</i>

01:49:21.165 --> 01:49:24.127
<i>Deep in the memory of what once was love</i>

01:53:13.397 --> 01:53:16.400
I'll be back in a minute.

01:53:16.567 --> 01:53:18.111
One minute.

01:53:41.217 --> 01:53:43.094
No!

01:53:46.347 --> 01:53:47.974
No!

01:54:48.951 --> 01:54:52.079
Can someone help me?

01:54:53.247 --> 01:54:55.333
Anybody, please?

01:54:57.251 --> 01:54:58.920
Can someone help me?

01:54:59.305 --> 01:55:05.258
