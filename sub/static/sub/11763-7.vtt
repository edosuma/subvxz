WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.534
OKAY,
I'M TURNING 42 TOMORROW.

00:03.534 --> 00:06.707
LUCKILY, I'M DATING SOMEONE
OLDER THAN ME.
I'M ONLY 40.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.280
FROM NOW ON, YOU'RE 43.
WE'RE ALL COOL WITH THAT, RIGHT?
(Ellie) YEAH, SURE.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.682
OH, YEAH.
YEAH, OF COURSE.

00:11.682 --> 00:15.346
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S
THE WAY AGE WORKS.
SO, JULES, WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?

00:15.346 --> 00:18.149
WELL, BESIDES WINE AND CAKE,
I GOT NOTHIN'.

00:18.149 --> 00:20.521
I HAVE AN IDEA. MY COUSIN
OWNS AN AWESOME GUN RANGE.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.324
WELL, TECHNICALLY, I GUESS IT'S
HIS BACKYARD, AND HE DOES LIVE,

00:23.324 --> 00:26.727
LIKE, RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO
A DAY CARE CENTER, BUT STILL--

00:26.727 --> 00:29.660
I'M GONNA PUT SHOOTING CHILDREN
IN THE "MAYBE" PILE.

00:29.660 --> 00:32.163
GO.
(Andy) MM.

00:32.163 --> 00:33.804
(gasps)

00:33.804 --> 00:36.807
(whispers) I'M SCARED.
I WANNA KNOW
WHO FINISHED THE WINE

00:36.807 --> 00:39.340
WITHOUT OPENING ANOTHER BOTTLE.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.473
ANDY, GUN TO YOUR HEAD.
(high-pitched voice) WAS IT YOU?

00:42.473 --> 00:45.276
(sighs) FINE.
I'LL OPEN ANOTHER BOTTLE.

00:45.276 --> 00:47.678
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
TRUTH GUNS.

00:47.678 --> 00:49.680
THEY'VE BEEN SO GREAT
FOR OUR MARRIAGE.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.553
IF THE GUN IS POINTED AT YOU,
YOU GOTTA COME CLEAN.

00:52.553 --> 00:56.056
YOU WANT IN?
YEAH. GRAYSON! DO YOU EVER
THINK OF YOUR EX-WIFE

00:56.056 --> 00:58.829
WHILE YOU'RE HAVING SEX
WITH ME?

00:58.829 --> 01:00.531
THANKS FOR THIS, ELLIE.

01:00.531 --> 01:03.234
CARLJHUNG?

01:03.234 --> 01:06.737
SOUNDS LIKE THE NOISE IN MY HEAD
WHEN I HIT THAT SWEET 3-IRON.

01:06.737 --> 01:09.740
JHUNG!
THE BOOK IS ACTUALLY A RIVETING
TREATISE ON THE HUMAN CONDITION.

01:09.740 --> 01:13.144
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS A RIVETING
TREATISE ON THE HUMAN CONDITION?

01:13.144 --> 01:14.445
MY BUTT.

01:14.445 --> 01:16.147
(laughs)

01:16.147 --> 01:18.078
OH, MAN.
I'M SO STUFFED UP.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.382
YOU HAVE TO TRY MY NETI POT.
YOU JUST POUR IT IN YOUR NOSE,

01:21.382 --> 01:25.116
AND IT CLEARS YOU RIGHT UP.
(high-pitched voice) AH!
OH, IS THIS ANOTHER ONE OF
THOSE SNOOTY COLLEGE THINGS,

01:25.116 --> 01:27.818
LIKE THAT PICNIC BASKET
YOU TAKE TO THE SHOWER?
A LOT OF PEOPLE
USE SHOWER CADDIES.

01:27.818 --> 01:29.820
DAD, NETI POTS AREN'T
A COLLEGE THING, OKAY?

01:29.820 --> 01:33.124
THEY'VE BEEN MAKING PEOPLE
FEEL BETTER FOR CENTURIES.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE

01:33.124 --> 01:35.866
HAS BEEN MAKING PEOPLE FEEL
BETTER FOR CENTURIES?
AW, DAMN. IT'S HIS BUTT.

01:35.866 --> 01:37.528
(laughs)

01:37.528 --> 01:40.531
JULES, I KNOW WHAT
WE SHOULD DO FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

01:40.531 --> 01:43.574
LET'S GO DIRTY DANCING
IN THE PLAZA.

01:43.574 --> 01:46.877
THEY HAVE A DEEJAY AND GUESS
WHAT ELSE? THESE HIPS.

01:46.877 --> 01:50.541
(imitating electronic beat)

01:52.213 --> 01:54.885
THIS, IF YOU'RE WONDERING,
IS MY IMAGINARY MACE SPRAY.

01:54.885 --> 01:58.219
(imitates spray)
OW. OW. IT BURNS,
IT BURNS, IT BURNS.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.721
COME ON!
IT'S--IT'S SO MUCH FUN--

02:00.721 --> 02:03.554
ANDY, IT'S NOT HAPPENING.
BEAT IT.

02:03.554 --> 02:06.197
I WOULD'VE
LET HIM DOWN NICELY.

02:06.197 --> 02:08.699
PLEASE. YOU HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE

02:08.699 --> 02:10.701
BEING MARRIED
TO A SUPERSENSITIVE GUY.

02:10.701 --> 02:13.634
I LIKE TO CALL THEM
"SENSIES."
(refrigerator door opens,
bottles rattle)

02:13.634 --> 02:16.607
MM. I DON'T. ANDY'S GREAT.
IT'S NEVER OKAY TO HURT HIM.

02:16.607 --> 02:19.810
WOW, YOU--YOU GOT ME
FAT-FREE YOGURT?

02:19.810 --> 02:21.472
MESSAGE RECEIVED.

02:21.472 --> 02:23.544
JUST EAT IT, HUSKY PANTS.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.676
(chuckles)
I WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER

02:25.676 --> 02:28.679
AT BEING MARRIED TO ANDY
THAN YOU.
GO FOR IT.

02:28.679 --> 02:30.851
OKAY, A FEW
BIRTHDAY GIFT GROUND RULES--

02:30.851 --> 02:32.853
NO GAG GIFTS, NO GIFT CARDS,

02:32.853 --> 02:36.187
AND NOTHING THAT I'M SUPPOSED
TO LOVE BECAUSE IT'S CHARITABLE.

02:36.187 --> 02:38.459
LAURIE, I'M STILL PISSED
THAT YOU SAVED AN ELEPHANT

02:38.459 --> 02:41.632
IN MY NAME.
TUK-TUK? I LOVE TUK-TUK!

02:41.632 --> 02:43.634
SCREW TUK-TUK. I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT TUK-TUK

02:43.634 --> 02:46.337
UNLESS YOU GOT A NECKLACE
MADE OUT OF HIS TUSKS.
(gasps)

02:46.337 --> 02:48.339
AND, TRAV,
NO MORE HUG COUPONS.

02:48.339 --> 02:50.841
I MEAN, YES, I'M GONNA USE
THIS ONE. (chuckles) AW.

02:50.841 --> 02:53.204
MM!

02:53.204 --> 02:56.907
TRAV, YOU'RE 19.
GET IN THE GAME!
HOW ABOUT
I LET YOU CUT MY HAIR?

02:56.907 --> 03:00.211
MAYBE. AS ALWAYS,
I WILL PICK THE GIFT WINNER.

03:00.211 --> 03:04.655
THE LOSERS WILL BE JUDGED
AND MOCKED.
THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE
FOR A NEW BOYFRIEND.

03:04.655 --> 03:06.917
YOU'RE 43. YOU'LL BE FINE.
HE'S 43?

03:06.917 --> 03:08.589
YEAH.
NO.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.561
I'M GONNA BE HAPPY
WITH WHATEVER YOU GET ME.

03:10.561 --> 03:12.563
YOU KNOW,
AS LONG AS IT'S PERFECT

03:12.563 --> 03:15.626
AND SHOWS HOW MUCH
YOU CARE ABOUT ME.
(slaps leg)

03:16.967 --> 03:18.469
(grunts)

03:18.469 --> 03:20.431
(nasal voice)
HEY, HEY, COLLEGE.

03:20.431 --> 03:23.304
I'M CALLING YOU "COLLEGE" NOW,
'CAUSE YOU GO TO COLLEGE.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.906
YEAH,
I PIECED THAT TOGETHER.
(groans)

03:25.906 --> 03:29.280
JUST USE THE NETI POT.
YOU JUST PUT IN THE SALINE...

03:29.280 --> 03:31.712
LIKE SO...
POUR IT IN ONE NOSTRIL,

03:31.712 --> 03:34.945
AND WATCH THE BAD STUFF
FLUSH OUT THE OTHER.

03:34.945 --> 03:37.488
ARE YOU SURE I CAN DO IT?

03:37.488 --> 03:40.421
I... BELIEVE... IN YOU.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.523
CHEERS. (grunts)

03:44.224 --> 03:47.598
(siren wailing)

03:47.598 --> 03:49.600
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO
ON MY BIRTHDAY,

03:49.600 --> 03:52.603
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GREAT TIME,
'CAUSE I'M GONNA BE

03:52.603 --> 03:55.836
WITH MY FRIENDS--YOU, TRAV,
GRAYSON, LAURIE, AND BOBBY.
YOU DIDN'T SAY MY NAME.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.338
(laughs) YES, I DID.

03:57.338 --> 04:00.311
I SAID, "YOU, TRAV, GRAYSON,
LAURIE, ANDY,BOBBY."

04:00.311 --> 04:03.314
YOU SAID, "GRAYSON,
LAURIE,ANDBOBBY."

04:03.314 --> 04:05.376
WHAT ARE YOU,
A HUMAN TAPE RECORDER?

04:05.376 --> 04:09.019
YEP.
SO WHEN YOU THINK OF FRIENDS,
YOU DON'T THINK OF ME.

04:09.019 --> 04:11.852
COME ON. WE'RE, LIKE,
THE CLASSIC AMERICAN DUO.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.955
YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE SEE US
TOGETHER, THEY'RE LIKE,

04:14.955 --> 04:16.957
"THERE GOES ANDY AND JULES--

04:16.957 --> 04:18.929
HOT DOG AND STICK."
(chuckles)

04:18.929 --> 04:20.861
OH, HOT DOG.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.294
I'M HOT DOG!
GUN TO YOUR HEAD.

04:23.294 --> 04:26.297
IF ELLIE AND I WEREN'T MARRIED,
WOULD WE BE FRIENDS?

04:26.297 --> 04:28.639
(chuckles) OH, GOD. ANDY--
(imitates gun cocking)

04:28.639 --> 04:30.941
(gasps) HE COCKED IT.

04:30.941 --> 04:33.974
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE NOT.

04:33.974 --> 04:37.808
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
WE WOULDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER.

04:37.808 --> 04:41.412
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW
WHERE I STAND.

04:41.412 --> 04:42.913
OHH.

04:42.913 --> 04:46.387
"ANDY'S A GREAT GUY.
IT'S NEVER OKAY TO HURT HIM."

04:46.387 --> 04:49.720
IF YOU DO THAT AGAIN, I'M GONNA
THROW THIS FRUIT AT YOU.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.062
BOOP. REWIND.
(imitates tape rewinding)

04:52.062 --> 04:53.764
"ANDY'S A GREAT GUY--"

04:53.764 --> 04:56.727
JUST DON'T!
AAH! (laughs)

04:56.727 --> 04:58.729
в™Єв™Єв™Є

05:07.938 --> 05:11.081
HEY, HOT DOG.
HOW YA DOIN'?

05:11.081 --> 05:13.083
THAT'S REALLY OFFENSIVE
TO BALD PEOPLE.

05:13.083 --> 05:15.315
JUST TELL HIM
TO SLAP OUT OF IT.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.317
HE'S ACTING LIKE
THE MOPEY DWARF.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.790
NO,
THERE'S NO MOPEY DWARF.
YES, THERE IS.

05:19.790 --> 05:21.922
DOPEY, SLEEPY, SNEEZY,
BASHFUL, GRUMPY, HAPPY, DOC.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.794
BOOM! YOU'RE WRONG.

05:23.794 --> 05:27.057
SORRY, I TAKE
MY DISNEY CHARACTERS SERIOUSLY.

05:27.057 --> 05:30.931
IT'S TIME TO PROVE THAT
WE'RE FRIENDS. LET'S GO, ANDY.
FINE. I'LL GET MY STUFF.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.834
NO, NO.
IT'S JUST ANDY AND ME.
WHAT?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.836
NO.
YES.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.569
YOU CAN TOUCH MY HEAD NOW
IF YOU WANT.

05:38.569 --> 05:41.111
(chuckles) IT'S SMOOTH...
(gasps) LIKE A RIVER ROCK.

05:41.111 --> 05:42.943
(high-pitched voice)
IT TICKLES.
(laughs)

05:42.943 --> 05:44.645
OHH.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.117
(grunts, spits)

05:47.117 --> 05:49.950
SO YOU POURED THIS WHOLE PITCHER
DIRECTLY INTO YOUR LUNGS?

05:49.950 --> 05:52.983
I MEAN, AT SOME POINT YOU MUST
HAVE KNOWN YOU WERE DROWNING.

05:52.983 --> 05:54.485
WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP?

05:54.485 --> 05:57.488
BOBBY COBB NEVER QUITS.
NOT EVEN AT KILLING HIMSELF?

05:57.488 --> 06:00.360
NOT EVEN. THAT'S
A STUPID COLLEGE DEATH POT.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.032
STILL NOT A COLLEGE THING.

06:02.032 --> 06:06.036
WHATEVER, MAN. THAT'S THE MOST
DANGEROUS THING ON MY BOAT.
REALLY?

06:06.036 --> 06:08.999
I'M JUST GONNA SPIN AROUND
AND SAY THE FIRST THING I SEE.

06:08.999 --> 06:12.002
LOADED FLARE GUN
ON A JAR FULL OF GASOLINE.

06:12.002 --> 06:14.405
WELL, THAT'S
FOR WHEN THE RATS COME.

06:14.405 --> 06:16.507
LOOK, DON'T TELL ANYBODY
ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

06:16.507 --> 06:18.649
I PROMISE.

06:18.649 --> 06:21.552
UH... OH. (grunts)

06:21.552 --> 06:23.754
(nasal voice) DOCTOR SAID
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

06:23.754 --> 06:25.756
FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.

06:25.756 --> 06:30.421
EVERY YEAR, WHEN I WIN
THE JULES GIFT CONTEST,

06:30.421 --> 06:32.923
I GO OUT AND BUY MYSELF
A CHUNKY RING.

06:32.923 --> 06:35.426
I USUALLY DON'T WEAR THEM
ALL AT ONCE, BUT...

06:35.426 --> 06:37.127
(high-pitched voice)WHAT?

06:37.127 --> 06:40.000
I DON'T HAVE ONE YET,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.002
BUT I'M GETTING IT
THIS YEAR.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.575
HEY, IF WE TEAM UP,
WE CAN TAKE HER DOWN.

06:44.575 --> 06:46.677
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP,

06:46.677 --> 06:49.540
'CAUSE I GOT THIS ONE
IN THE BAG.

06:49.540 --> 06:52.543
JULES SHOWED ME THIS LOVELY
LITTLE BLOUSE LAST MONTH.

06:52.543 --> 06:54.585
MM. PERFECT GIFT.

06:54.585 --> 06:56.086
(high-pitched voice)
BOUGHT IT.

06:56.086 --> 06:58.088
AND YOU KNOW SHE LIKES IT,

06:58.088 --> 07:00.891
'CAUSE SHE PICKED IT OUT
HERSELF.

07:00.891 --> 07:03.894
PLUS YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT ANY
PERSONAL THOUGHT INTO IT AT ALL.

07:03.894 --> 07:07.498
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE
HER DO? HAVE HER PAY FOR IT.

07:07.498 --> 07:09.760
THEN SHE CAN WRITE HERSELF
A CARD TELLING HERSELF

07:09.760 --> 07:12.763
HOW MUCH YOU CARE ABOUT HER.
WORST GIFT EVER!
DUDE.

07:12.763 --> 07:15.966
в™Є LOOK AT MY RINGS,
MY RINGS, MY RINGS в™Є

07:15.966 --> 07:18.138
в™Є LOOK AT MY RINGS, MY RINGS,
MY RINGS... в™Є

07:18.138 --> 07:21.141
LET'S TEAM UP AND KILL HER.
в™Є LOOK AT MY RINGS, MY RINGS,
MY RINGS в™Є

07:21.141 --> 07:23.914
SHE IS THE WHITEST WOMAN
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

07:23.914 --> 07:26.577
в™Є LOOK AT MY RINGS,
MY RINGS, MY RINGS в™Є

07:26.577 --> 07:29.650
I MEAN, I REALLY CAN'T STOP.
(laughs)

07:29.650 --> 07:32.152
WE MAY HAVE TO BUY YOU
A HAT.
(chuckles)

07:32.152 --> 07:34.985
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD?

07:34.985 --> 07:37.958
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
EACH OTHER THAT WELL.
YOU'RE FROM DeLAND, FLORIDA.

07:37.958 --> 07:41.662
YOUR BLOOD TYPE IS B-POSITIVE.
IT'S ALSO YOUR LIFE MOTTO.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.794
YOU HATE WATERFALLS.
YOUR FAVORITE COLOR IS BLACK.

07:43.794 --> 07:46.797
YOUR FAVORITE SMELL IS NEW BABY,
AND ONCE WHEN YOU WERE 6,

07:46.797 --> 07:49.740
YOU GOT LOST IN A MALL AND SPENT
THE NIGHT IN A PET STORE.
(chuckles)

07:49.740 --> 07:52.472
NOW DO ME.
UH, YOU ARE ACUBANO.
(chuckles)

07:52.472 --> 07:55.576
SГ­.(chuckles)
YOUR FULL NAME IS ANDREW.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.648
MNH-MNH.

07:57.648 --> 07:59.980
NO? JUST ANDY?
ALL RIGHT. HONEST MISTAKE.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.213
(chuckles)
AND... THAT'S YOU!

08:03.213 --> 08:06.016
ANDREW ANDY TORRES.
(chuckles)

08:06.016 --> 08:09.159
(mouths word)
OH, GOD. HERE COMES BARB.

08:09.159 --> 08:11.161
I GOT THIS.
WHAT?

08:11.161 --> 08:12.993
HI, BARB.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.026
I USUALLY TALK TO JULES.
I WANT TO TELL HER ALL ABOUT

08:16.026 --> 08:19.169
MY TRIP TO LONDON
AND ALL THE TIME I SPENT

08:19.169 --> 08:22.172
UNDER BIG BEN. (chuckles)
YES. NOT THE CLOCK,
BUT AN ACTUAL GUY NAMED BEN?

08:22.172 --> 08:25.175
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?
OH, LOOK. A HIGH SCHOOL TRACK
TEAM HOSING EACH OTHER DOWN.

08:25.175 --> 08:27.678
OH.

08:27.678 --> 08:29.209
ANDY TORRES,
YOU ARE AMAZING!

08:29.209 --> 08:31.211
NOW YOU SKIP YOUR ASS
BACK OVER HERE!

08:31.211 --> 08:33.984
WE'RE GONNA GET
SOME CHAMPAGNE. WAITER!

08:33.984 --> 08:35.045
(thud) OW!
WHAT?

08:35.045 --> 08:37.888
OW.
MAN DOWN!

08:37.888 --> 08:39.820
WE NEED GIFT IDEAS.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.693
HOW ABOUT...
A CHARM BRACELET?

08:42.693 --> 08:45.025
JULES HATES CHARM BRACELETS.
HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.028
SHE WAS SAYING THAT SHE WANTS
TO HAVE MORE DINNER PARTIES--

08:48.028 --> 08:50.761
OOH! I CAN GET
HER COOKING LESSONS.

08:50.761 --> 08:52.763
AND I'LL GET HER
SOME NEW COOKWARE

08:52.763 --> 08:55.766
AND MAYBE AN APRON WITH
TWO FRIED EGGS ON THE CHEST

08:55.766 --> 08:58.769
AND A STRIP OF BACON ON HER...
(singsongy) WHOA-OH!
WE'RE DONE.

08:58.769 --> 09:01.642
(normal voice)
NO, WE'RE NOT DONE.

09:01.642 --> 09:05.175
ELLIE WILL FIND A BETTER GIFT.
SHE'S THE GIFT WHISPERER.
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

09:05.175 --> 09:07.618
NEED TO BREAK OUT
MY NEW PHONE APP.

09:07.618 --> 09:09.620
IT DOES
DRAMATIC MUSIC STINGS.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.682
OH! I GOT IT.
ASK ME AGAIN.

09:11.682 --> 09:14.224
(lowered voice)
WHAT DO WE DO TO ELLIE?

09:14.224 --> 09:16.627
(dramatic music plays)

09:16.627 --> 09:18.989
SABOTAGE!

09:18.989 --> 09:21.061
THANK YOU.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.594
I CAN'T BELIEVE I SPRAINED
MY ANKLE SKIPPING.

09:23.594 --> 09:25.335
WOW, YOU'RE HAIRY.

09:25.335 --> 09:27.297
I GUESS I CAN'T BUG YA

09:27.297 --> 09:30.040
ABOUT GOING DIRTY DANCING
ANYMORE, HUH?

09:30.040 --> 09:32.743
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
THIS AMAZING PARTY

09:32.743 --> 09:34.344
FOR MY GRANDMOTHER MARIA.

09:34.344 --> 09:36.106
SHE WAS A POLICEWOMAN.

09:36.106 --> 09:38.108
THEY CALLED HER
"THE STABILIZER."

09:38.108 --> 09:40.911
OOH.
SHE COULD CLEAN UP ANY MESS.

09:40.911 --> 09:43.914
WELL, AT THIS PARTY, SHE WENT
CRAZY ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

09:43.914 --> 09:47.587
IT WAS, LIKE, THE FIRST TIME
I SAW HER JOY FOR LIFE.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.119
IT JUST MOVED ME.

09:49.119 --> 09:52.923
WE'RE GOING DANCING
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

09:52.923 --> 09:57.127
YOU WENT OUT WITH ANDY, AND NOW
HE'S GETTING WHAT HE WANTED.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
HE PLAYED ME?

09:57.127 --> 10:00.600
YOU KNOW WHY ANDY GETS
SO MUCH SEX?
HE GETS A LOT OF SEX?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.703
HE GOADS ME
UNTIL I SAY SOMETHING MEAN.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.205
HE PRETENDS HE'S HURT.
I LET HIM HIT THIS.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.739
AND PRESTO! HE'S OKAY.
IT'S A MIRACLE.

10:08.739 --> 10:10.741
JULES, HE'S AN EVIL GENIUS.

10:10.741 --> 10:12.843
HE'S KEYSER SOZE.

10:12.843 --> 10:14.945
NO, HE'S NOT.
HE IS.

10:14.945 --> 10:18.218
NO, HE'S NOT! GOD!

10:18.218 --> 10:19.990
WHO'S KEYSER SOZE?

10:19.990 --> 10:21.621
(mouths word)

10:21.621 --> 10:23.794
(sighs)

10:23.794 --> 10:26.056
YOU KNOW
WHAT ELLIE'S TRICK IS?

10:26.056 --> 10:28.058
SHE WATCHES JULES
LIKE A HAWK

10:28.058 --> 10:30.761
AND PICKS UP ON TINY HINTS
AROUND HER HOUSE

10:30.761 --> 10:32.763
TO PICK THE PERFECT GIFT.

10:32.763 --> 10:35.065
WE NEED TO USE THAT
AGAINST HER,

10:35.065 --> 10:37.067
MAYBE PLANT SOME TINY THING

10:37.067 --> 10:39.069
TO SEND HER DOWN
THE WRONG PATH.

10:39.069 --> 10:41.411
(gasps) OH!
LIKE A KEY CHAIN. OH, YES.

10:41.411 --> 10:44.414
OH, THEY CAN SAY A LOT
ABOUT A PERSON.
THIS IS STUPID.

10:44.414 --> 10:47.317
ELLIE CAN'T BE THAT GOOD
AT PRESENTS. HEY, WHAT'S THAT?

10:47.317 --> 10:51.251
OH, IT'S A SMALL GIFT.
I REMEMBER THAT YOU BOUGHT

10:51.251 --> 10:53.323
THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION
OF "APOLLO 13,"

10:53.323 --> 10:56.026
AND THEN I HEARD YOU
TELL ANDY

10:56.026 --> 10:59.029
HOW MUCH YOUR FATHER WOULD'VE
LIKED IT IF HE WERE ALIVE,

10:59.029 --> 11:00.390
AND THEN I THOUGHT,

11:00.390 --> 11:03.393
MAYBE YOUR DAD LOVED THE IDEA
OF BEING AN ASTRONAUT

11:03.393 --> 11:06.236
BECAUSE HE'D WISHED HE HAD
A MORE ADVENTUROUS LIFE.

11:06.236 --> 11:10.070
I THOUGHT THAT ROCKET SHIP
WOULD REMIND YOU OF HIM.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.371
OPEN IT UP.

11:18.348 --> 11:21.351
IT'S A PICTURE OF ME
IN HIS LAP.

11:21.351 --> 11:23.113
TURNS OUT,

11:23.113 --> 11:25.956
HIS REAL ADVENTURE
WAS RAISING YOU.

11:25.956 --> 11:27.387
GO AHEAD.

11:27.387 --> 11:31.021
SAY WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

11:31.021 --> 11:33.023
(voice breaks) I LOVE IT.

11:33.023 --> 11:35.225
(mouths words)

11:35.225 --> 11:37.127
(whispers) GIFT WHISPERER.

11:37.127 --> 11:40.270
TOO MUCH WATER!
TOO MUCH WATER!
(bottle clatters)

11:40.270 --> 11:43.233
WHOA!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
WHOA, YOU'RE DREAMING.

11:43.233 --> 11:47.337
WHAT,
YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?
I DO. KEVIN LAUGHED HIS ASS OFF
WHEN I TOLD HIM.

11:47.337 --> 11:49.810
I ASKED YOU
NOT TO TELL ANYONE!

11:49.810 --> 11:55.115
DO YOU THINK I TELL MY FRIENDS
THAT YOU USE MOM'S MAKEUP

11:55.115 --> 11:56.116
TO COVER YOUR FOREHEAD ZITS?
OFF MY BOAT, COVERGIRL!
DAD.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.088
(grunts)

11:58.088 --> 12:00.150
(groans)

12:00.150 --> 12:02.492
OH. I LOVE
"THE USUAL SUSPECTS"!

12:02.492 --> 12:04.494
YOU TOLD ME
BEFORE IT STARTED

12:04.494 --> 12:06.957
THAT KEVIN SPACEY WAS
KEYSER SOZE...
MM-HMM.

12:06.957 --> 12:09.159
AND I WAS STILL SURPRISED.

12:09.159 --> 12:11.161
WAIT. WAS HE KEYSER SOZE?

12:11.161 --> 12:13.063
YES!

12:13.063 --> 12:16.837
ALL RIGHT, SO THE CRIPPLED GUY
WAS HIS EVIL TWIN?

12:16.837 --> 12:18.869
NO! SAME GUY.

12:18.869 --> 12:21.511
WELL, LET'S JUST AGREE
TO DISAGREE.
(whispers) ALL RIGHT.

12:21.511 --> 12:25.145
DO YOU REALLY THINK
ANDY IS THAT MANIPULATIVE?

12:25.145 --> 12:27.477
I MEAN, THIS CAN'T ALL BE
ABOUT DANCING.

12:27.477 --> 12:30.020
COME WITH ME.

12:30.020 --> 12:33.123
(samba music playing)

12:33.123 --> 12:35.125
JUST DOING A LITTLE COUCH SAMBA.

12:35.125 --> 12:36.787
MM.

12:36.787 --> 12:40.230
(makes slapping sound)

12:49.169 --> 12:50.841
I'M SORRY, ELLIE.

12:50.841 --> 12:54.104
I KNOW YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE
THAT ANDY IS KIEFER DOOZY--

12:54.104 --> 12:56.206
KEYSER SOZE.

12:56.206 --> 12:58.508
I'M NOT BUYING IT.
IT'S ANDY, OKAY?

12:58.508 --> 13:02.082
HE IS MY HOT DOG... OR MY STICK.
I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH ONE.

13:02.082 --> 13:05.515
WHEN YOU GUYS WERE OUT,
WHO BROUGHT UP DANCING AGAIN?
HE DID.

13:05.515 --> 13:08.088
MM-HMM.
HE'S GOT A SPRAINED ANKLE.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.961
DID YOU ACTUALLY
SEE HIM FALL?

13:10.961 --> 13:12.262
OW.

13:12.262 --> 13:13.964
NO, BUT...

13:13.964 --> 13:15.265
(chuckles)

13:15.265 --> 13:18.168
ELLIE, HIS ANKLE IS
SO SWOLLEN.

13:18.168 --> 13:22.372
OH, MY GOD. THEY'RE ALWAYS
THAT BIG, AREN'T THEY?

13:22.372 --> 13:24.434
LIKE A SNAKE THAT
SWALLOWED A VOLLEYBALL.

13:24.434 --> 13:28.438
BUT YOU SHOULD'VE HEARD HIM.
I MEAN, HE POURED HIS HEART OUT.

13:28.438 --> 13:31.141
YOU KNOW,
I REMEMBER THIS AMAZING PARTY

13:31.141 --> 13:34.244
FOR MY GRANDMOTHER... MARIA.

13:34.244 --> 13:36.987
SHE WAS A POLICEWOMAN.

13:36.987 --> 13:40.220
CALLED HER...
"THE STABILIZER,"

13:40.220 --> 13:41.922
BECAUSE SHE COULD...

13:41.922 --> 13:43.894
CLEAN UP ANY MESS.

13:43.894 --> 13:47.127
IS HIS GRANDMOTHER'S NAME
EVEN MARIA?

13:47.127 --> 13:50.230
I DON'T KNOW
HIS RELATIVES' NAMES.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.833
JULES, YOU HAVE TO CRUSH HIM.
WHEN HE KNOWS YOU'RE ON TO HIM,

13:53.833 --> 13:56.266
HE'S JUST GONNA SHRUG
HIS SHOULDERS

13:56.266 --> 13:59.569
AND SAY, "EH, YOU GOT ME."
I'M DOING THIS.

14:02.412 --> 14:04.444
MM-HMM.

14:06.276 --> 14:09.279
(gasps)
DID YOU SEE THAT?
SHE TOTALLY TOOK THE BAIT.

14:09.279 --> 14:11.982
(door closes)
I KNOW HOW HER BRAIN WORKS.

14:11.982 --> 14:14.985
(laughs) SHE'S GONNA THINK
THAT JULES IS INTO ASIAN ART.

14:14.985 --> 14:17.988
JULESHATESASIAN ART.
SHE JUST DOESN'T TELL PEOPLE,

14:17.988 --> 14:20.290
BECAUSE SHE THINKS
IT MAKES HER RACIST. (laughs)

14:20.290 --> 14:24.134
DAD, I CAME TO APOLOGIZE.

14:24.134 --> 14:26.897
YOU EVER LOOK DEATH
IN THE EYE, TRAV?

14:26.897 --> 14:28.899
WELL, NOW THAT
THAT JAR OF GASOLINE

14:28.899 --> 14:32.142
HAS A FLAMING CAN OF STERNO
NEXT TO IT, I'D HAVE TO SAY YES.

14:32.142 --> 14:34.074
I'M MAKING BEANS, BUT YOUR
COLLEGE-Y NETI POT'S MOCKIN' ME.

14:34.074 --> 14:38.008
DAD, LET ME LIST
SOME ACTUAL COLLEGE THINGS,

14:38.008 --> 14:40.010
LIKE INDIE BANDS,

14:40.010 --> 14:41.311
FRESHMAN 15,

14:41.311 --> 14:44.014
DABBLING IN LESBIANISM--
THAT'S FOR GIRLS--

14:44.014 --> 14:46.056
ENCOURAGING GIRLS
TO DABBLE IN LESBIANISM--

14:46.056 --> 14:47.617
THAT'S FOR GUYS--

14:47.617 --> 14:49.319
RAMEN NOODLES, KEGGERS,

14:49.319 --> 14:51.321
HAVING A BLACK ROOMMATE
THAT MAKES YOU SELF-CONSCIOUS

14:51.321 --> 14:53.323
ABOUT SINGING ALL
YOUR FAVORITE RAP SONGS.

14:53.323 --> 14:55.425
BUT NETI POTS--
IT'S NOT A COLLEGE THING.

14:55.425 --> 14:57.527
THAT POT HAS BECOME
A SYMBOL.

14:57.527 --> 15:00.530
YEAH, YOU'RE OFF LEARNING
ALL KINDS OF NEW STUFF,

15:00.530 --> 15:03.073
AND I'M AFRAID I WON'T
BE ABLE TO KEEP UP.

15:03.073 --> 15:05.405
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE
OUR CONNECTION, TRAV.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.207
STUPID, ISN'T IT?

15:07.207 --> 15:11.341
YEAH. BUT TO HELL WITH IT.
LET'S CONQUER THE NETI POT!

15:11.341 --> 15:15.115
THAT'S RIGHT!
YOU THINK I CAN?
WE CAN.

15:15.115 --> 15:18.618
I'M GONNA DIAL "9" AND "1" SO I
ONLY HAVE TO PUSH ONE BUTTON.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.320
(exhales deeply)

15:20.320 --> 15:24.554
WHAT'S UP?
ANDY, I DON'T THINK
YOUR FEELINGS ARE REALLY HURT.

15:24.554 --> 15:28.098
SO WE WOULDN'T BE FRIENDS
IF IT WEREN'T FOR ELLIE.

15:28.098 --> 15:30.530
I MEAN, WHO CARES?
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

15:30.530 --> 15:33.233
YOUR ANKLE'S NOT SPRAINED,
AND WE'RE NOT GOING DANCING.

15:33.233 --> 15:37.067
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
SO YOU THINK
I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON?

15:37.067 --> 15:38.408
NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:38.408 --> 15:41.411
NO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SAY, "EH, YOU GOT ME."

15:41.411 --> 15:44.274
ALL RIGHT. GUN TO YOUR HEAD.

15:44.274 --> 15:46.146
ARE YOU LYING?

15:46.146 --> 15:48.448
IF YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME,
SHOOT ME,

15:48.448 --> 15:51.551
BUT LET ME ASK YOU
ONE THING.
(gasps)

15:51.551 --> 15:54.124
WHO MADE YOU DOUBT ME?
IT WAS ELLIE.

15:54.124 --> 15:57.187
ELLIE SAID THAT YOU PRETEND
TO GET YOUR FEELINGS HURT.

15:57.187 --> 16:00.630
THEN SHE GIVES YOU WHAT
YOU WANT, LIKE SEX OR DANCING,

16:00.630 --> 16:04.334
AND THEN SUDDENLY YOUR FEELINGS
AREN'T HURT ANYMORE.

16:04.334 --> 16:08.098
YEAH, WITH ELLIE SOMETIMES I DO
PRETEND IT DOESN'T HURT ANYMORE,

16:08.098 --> 16:09.639
EVEN THOUGH IT DOES.

16:09.639 --> 16:11.971
IT'S CALLED
MAKING A MARRIAGE WORK.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.345
BUT I WOULD NEVER PLAY
THAT GAME WITH MY FRIEND.

16:15.345 --> 16:17.247
SO DID I LIE TO YOU?

16:20.610 --> 16:22.312
NO.

16:22.312 --> 16:26.286
(Enrique Iglesias' "Hero"
playing)

16:26.286 --> 16:30.520
в™Є I CAN BE YOUR HERO, BABY в™Є

16:32.522 --> 16:35.525
в™Є I CAN KISS AWAY THE PAIN в™Є

16:35.525 --> 16:39.099
в™Є OH, YEAH в™Є

16:39.099 --> 16:41.171
в™Є AND I CAN BE в™Є

16:41.171 --> 16:45.175
в™Є YOUR HERO в™Є

16:45.175 --> 16:50.680
в™Є I CAN KISS AWAY THE PAIN в™Є

16:50.680 --> 16:57.187
в™Є YOU CAN TAKE MY BREATH AWAY в™Є

16:57.187 --> 17:00.350
в™Є I CAN BE в™Є

17:00.350 --> 17:03.053
в™Є YOUR HERO в™Є

17:03.053 --> 17:05.795
I CAN'T SMELL ANYMORE.
IS THAT NORMAL?

17:05.795 --> 17:07.397
YEAH.

17:07.397 --> 17:09.559
OKAY. GIFT TIME.

17:09.559 --> 17:12.562
ELLIE, YOURS BETTER BE GOOD,
BECAUSE I AM MAD AT YOU.

17:12.562 --> 17:15.365
EVERYONE, PLEASE STAND.
OH, YAY.

17:15.365 --> 17:17.167
OH! ME FIRST.

17:17.167 --> 17:19.709
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOM.

17:19.709 --> 17:22.772
TRAVIS, ANOTHER HUG COUPON?
BUT THIS ONE'S GOOD
FOR PUBLIC USE.

17:22.772 --> 17:25.545
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I HATE THAT.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.548
WELL DONE. (chuckles)
YOU MAY BE SEATED.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.250
(clapping)

17:30.250 --> 17:33.353
AND, BOBBY,
FLOWERS ARE A LITTLE OBVIOUS,

17:33.353 --> 17:37.056
BUT IT IS AHUGESTEP UP FROM
THE TUB OF GUMBALLS YOU GOT ME

17:37.056 --> 17:39.359
FOR OUR TENTH ANNIVERSARY.
YOU MAY SIT.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.361
DID SHE JUST TELL ME
TO SIT DOWN?

17:41.361 --> 17:43.363
'CAUSE I CAN'T HEAR
A THING

17:43.363 --> 17:45.435
BESIDES WATER SLOSHING
BACK AND FORTH.

17:45.435 --> 17:48.298
AND NOW FOR THE MAIN EVENT.

17:48.298 --> 17:51.101
OH.

17:51.101 --> 17:54.104
(Bobby and Travis,
singsongy) OOH!

17:54.104 --> 17:56.306
IT'S
AN ANTIQUE CHINESE GONG.

17:56.306 --> 17:59.249
AH.
TELL ME
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE IT.

17:59.249 --> 18:01.681
I'M NOT SURE
I CAN PUT IT INTO WORDS.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.653
(gong bongs)

18:03.653 --> 18:06.356
IT SUCKS!
YOU STAY STANDING.

18:06.356 --> 18:09.359
(laughs)
SHE GONGED YOUR GONG.

18:09.359 --> 18:12.322
AND, GRAYSON... (grunts)
AND... COOKING CLASSES?

18:12.322 --> 18:14.324
YEAH, WE CAN TAKE 'EM
TOGETHER.

18:14.324 --> 18:17.197
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO STAY
IN, AND YOU KNOW, WE COULD--
(gong bongs)

18:17.197 --> 18:20.230
NEXT!
LAURIE, WE'RE SCREWED.

18:23.873 --> 18:26.536
(gasps)
COOKWARE?

18:26.536 --> 18:30.380
LOOK INSIDE THE BOX.

18:30.380 --> 18:32.142
(box thuds)

18:33.543 --> 18:35.215
A CHARM BRACELET?

18:35.215 --> 18:37.317
(both, singsongy) OOH.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.389
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, JULES.

18:39.389 --> 18:41.691
LAURIE, YOU'VE WON.

18:41.691 --> 18:43.393
WHOO! (laughs)

18:43.393 --> 18:44.694
WE WERE A TEAM.

18:44.694 --> 18:48.458
NO, WE WEREN'T. HEY, ELLIE.
CHECK OUT MY NEW CHUNKY RING.

18:48.458 --> 18:51.231
в™Є LOOK AT MY RING,
MY RING, MY RING в™Є

18:51.231 --> 18:53.803
в™Є OH, LOOK AT MY RING, MY RING,
MY RING в™Є

18:53.803 --> 18:57.367
(laughs)
GREAT, AND ANDY'S A NO-SHOW.
ELLIE, THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

18:57.367 --> 19:00.740
YOU ALWAYS ASSUME THE WORST
IN PEOPLE.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.243
YOU PROBABLY THINK
THAT GUY OVER THERE

19:03.243 --> 19:06.246
IS A SERIAL KILLER.
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S A BAD EXAMPLE.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.148
HE DEFINITELY HAS A LADY
IN HIS BASEMENT, BUT--

19:09.148 --> 19:11.581
ANDY'S JUST HOLDING OUT
TO MAKE SURE WE ALL CAME.

19:11.581 --> 19:13.283
HE'S THE DEVIL.

19:13.283 --> 19:16.486
(whispers) OW.

19:16.486 --> 19:18.458
(Ellie)
