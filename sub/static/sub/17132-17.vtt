WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.236
I'M READY TO GO.

00:02.236 --> 00:03.871
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

00:03.871 --> 00:06.540
WHAT MOVIE DID YOU PICK?

00:06.540 --> 00:09.543
OH, THE ONE WHERE THE BLACK COP
DRESSES UP LIKE HIS FAT GRANDMA

00:09.543 --> 00:11.879
AND BEATS UP
ALL THE CRIMINALS.

00:11.879 --> 00:14.215
COME ON.

00:14.215 --> 00:17.051
NO, ANGIE, THIS TIME
SHE BREAKS UP A TERRORIST CELL

00:17.051 --> 00:19.520
WITH NOTHING BUT HER PURSE
AND A ROLLING PIN.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.124
CAN'T WE SEE THE ONE
ABOUT THE SCIENTISTS

00:23.124 --> 00:25.093
FIGHTING GLOBAL WARMING?

00:25.093 --> 00:27.095
AS LONG AS ONE
OF THE SCIENTISTS

00:27.095 --> 00:30.064
IS DRESSED LIKE
A SASSY BLACK GRANDMA.

00:30.064 --> 00:34.902
I GOT YOUR HYBRID RIGHT HERE--
HALF BEAT DOWN, HALF WHOOP ASS.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.537
FINE, JUST GO ONLINE

00:36.537 --> 00:38.839
AND FIND OUT WHAT TIME
THE MOVIE'S PLAYING.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.274
(speaks indistinctly)

00:42.843 --> 00:43.877
(gasps)

00:43.877 --> 00:45.313
Ã³RALE, BILL GATES.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.183
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING TO MY COMPUTER?

00:49.183 --> 00:51.018
I'M PUTTING IN
A BETTER GRAPHICS CARD

00:51.018 --> 00:52.553
SO I CAN PLAY
MY NEW VIDEO GAME.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.189
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE DOING YOUR HOMEWORK.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.725
IT WAS TOO HARD.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.528
I'VE ALMOST GOT IT.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.796
OH, CRAP!
(gasps)

01:02.796 --> 01:06.066
WELL, I GUESS THAT GOES
IN THE BROKEN PILE.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.838
MAX, YOU KNOW
WHAT'S ON THIS COMPUTER?

01:10.838 --> 01:12.706
ALL MY BUSINESS FILES,

01:12.706 --> 01:14.242
OUR FAMILY PHOTOS

01:14.242 --> 01:16.844
AND A JOURNAL
OF MY PRIVATE THOUGHTS.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.580
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, MAX?

01:19.580 --> 01:22.816
NOW YOUR MOM HAS TO TELL ME
HER PRIVATE THOUGHTS.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.553
THANKS A LOT.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.089
WE NEEDED A NEW ONE ANYWAY.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.125
THIS THING'S, LIKE,
100 YEARS OLD.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.927
HEY, IT'S 2 YEARS OLD,
AND IT COSTS $1,000.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.431
YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES
FOR ME TO EARN THAT?
ALL RIGHT, SORRY.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.434
CAN'T YOU JUST PUT A NEW ONE
ON THE CREDIT CARD?

01:40.434 --> 01:44.104
AND HOW DO YOU THINK
WE PAY FOR THE CREDIT CARDS?

01:44.104 --> 01:46.407
YOU PUT IT
ON ANOTHER CREDIT CARD.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.379
I TOLD YOU HE LISTENS TO US.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.649
WHAT'S ALL THIS JUNK?

01:55.649 --> 01:58.852
MAX TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF
TO UPGRADE OUR COMPUTER,

01:58.852 --> 02:00.087
AND NOW IT'S BROKEN.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.655
HMM.

02:01.655 --> 02:05.159
SO, UH, WHAT'S YOUR BAD
PARENTING MOVE THIS TIME?

02:05.159 --> 02:06.727
GIVE HIM A CRAYON,

02:06.727 --> 02:09.763
LET HIM DRAW A PICTURE
OF HOW HE'S FEELING?

02:11.732 --> 02:14.368
NO.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.370
I TELL YOU
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.506
HE'S GONNA LEARN
HOW HARD IT IS TO MAKE $1,000.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.007
YOU'RE OUT OF SCHOOL
NEXT WEEK.

02:20.007 --> 02:23.177
YOU'RE GONNA COME AND WORK
AT THE FACTORY WITH ME.

02:23.177 --> 02:25.646
THAT'S MY VACATION. MOM!

02:25.646 --> 02:28.716
GEORGE, HE'S TOO YOUNG TO BE
WORKING DOWN AT THE FACTORY.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.851
SOME OF THE GUYS DOWN THERE
ARE PRETTY ROUGH.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.886
LOOK,
THERE'S BEEN ONE STABBING,

02:32.886 --> 02:34.555
AND THAT WAS OVER A WOMAN.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.557
ALL RIGHT? THAT COULD
HAPPEN AT WALL STREET.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.460
MAYBE NOT WITH
A SHARPENED SCREWDRIVER, BUT--
GEORGE.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.761
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.763
"CAN I SEE YOU
IN MY OFFICE FOR A SECOND?"

02:42.763 --> 02:45.366
"YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON?"
(speaks Spanish)
STOP IT!

02:45.366 --> 02:48.469
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

02:51.939 --> 02:53.607
* ALL MY FRIENDS

02:53.607 --> 02:57.378
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

02:58.979 --> 03:02.383
* THE LOW RIDER

03:02.383 --> 03:04.117
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

03:04.117 --> 03:07.621
**

03:16.063 --> 03:18.966
HEY, GEORGE.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.835
UM, DO YOU MIND IF I GIVE YOU
SOME, UH, PARENTING ADVICE?

03:21.835 --> 03:24.838
WHY WOULD I MIND?
YOU NEVER HAD ANY KIDS

03:24.838 --> 03:28.242
OR A PET THAT'S LIVED LONGER
THAN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.043
GO FOR IT.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.481
HEY, THAT TURTLE DIED
OF A RARE DISEASE, ALL RIGHT?

03:33.481 --> 03:35.483
YEAH, THEY GOT A CURE
FOR THAT NOW.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.818
IT'S CALLED TURTLE FOOD,
VATO, LETTUCE.

03:37.818 --> 03:41.722
HEY, HEY, I'M TALKING
ABOUT MAX, ALL RIGHT?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.724
HE'S BEEN WORKING HARDER
THAN EVERYBODY ALL WEEK.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.693
I THINK YOU CAN
EASE UP ON HIM.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.695
LOOK, MAX IS GONNA
KEEP BUSTING HIS BUTT

03:47.695 --> 03:49.997
UNTIL HE ADMITS THAT
EARNING $1,000

03:49.997 --> 03:51.965
IS HARDER THAN HE THOUGHT.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.367
HEY, DAD.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.769
ME AND THE GUYS JUST FINISHED
LOADING THOSE TRUCKS.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.739
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S PRETTY HARD WORK, HUH?

03:58.739 --> 04:00.741
ANYTHING
YOU READY TO SAY?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.743
NOPE,
JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO

04:02.743 --> 04:04.845
BEFORE "FANCY HAIR"
CRACKS THE WHIP.

04:04.845 --> 04:08.115
I HEARD THAT DOWN
ON THE LOADING DOCK.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.917
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

04:09.917 --> 04:12.886
I HAVE NO IDEA.
HEY, FOLLOW ME TO THE CAGE.

04:12.886 --> 04:16.890
OKAY, I WANT YOU TO ORGANIZE
EVERY NUT, BOLT AND SCREW,

04:16.890 --> 04:20.661
AND IF YOU FIND A DEAD MOUSE,
PUT IT IN THE BUCKET.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.564
THERE'S DEAD MICE IN THERE?

04:23.564 --> 04:25.599
WELL, WE HAD A CAT
THAT ATE 'EM,

04:25.599 --> 04:27.768
AND THEN SOMETHING
ATE THE CAT.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.871
IF I WERE YOU, I'D KEEP
YOUR BACK AGAINST THE WALL,

04:30.871 --> 04:33.674
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY,
HE DOES NOT LIKE VISITORS.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.781
HEY, GEORGE.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.282
GEORGE.

04:43.817 --> 04:47.955
I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT YOUR SON IS SO ADORABLE.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.157
OBVIOUSLY
HE GETS HIS GOOD LOOKS

04:50.157 --> 04:56.697
FROM HIS PAPACITO.

04:56.697 --> 05:01.001
WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT
SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON THE FLOOR?

05:01.001 --> 05:03.337
OKAY.

05:03.337 --> 05:06.740
SO I'M NOT
ON THE FLOOR.

05:08.476 --> 05:11.379
I'M ON THE TABLE.

05:12.880 --> 05:18.819
LOPEZ, PARTY OF ONE,
YOUR TABLE IS READY.

05:20.788 --> 05:25.325
GINA, IT'S CALLED MENO-PAUSE,
NOT MENO-KEEP-GOING.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.732
ANGIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

05:31.732 --> 05:33.734
WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO STOP BY

05:33.734 --> 05:36.604
AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU WEREN'T
WORKING MAX TOO HARD.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.372
HE'S LEARNING A LESSON.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.709
HEY, AND DON'T UNDERCUT ME
IN FRONT OF HIM.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.445
WE HAVE TO PRESENT
A UNIVERSAL FRONT.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.914
IT'S A UNITEDFRONT.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.917
YOU SEE? GET IT OUT.
GET IT ALL OUT.

05:51.885 --> 05:52.953
HEY, MOM.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.455
HOW YOU DOING, HONEY?

05:54.455 --> 05:56.156
YOU KNOW, DAD WAS RIGHT.

05:56.156 --> 05:59.393
YOU'VE GOTTA WORK HARD
TO MAKE 1,000 BUCKS.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.894
YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.196
HEY, NEXT TIME YOU WANNA BUY
$200-SHOES, BE CAREFUL.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.634
I'LL PUT YOU IN THE CAGE
CLEANING OUT THE RAT BUCKET.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.805
OKAY, YOU WIN.

06:11.805 --> 06:15.042
WORKING HERE WAS A GOOD IDEA,
AND NOW MAYBE YOU UNDERSTAND

06:15.042 --> 06:17.878
WHY WE WANT YOU
TO DO WELL IN SCHOOL.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.847
THAT WAY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO KILL YOURSELF

06:19.847 --> 06:22.850
DOING THIS KIND OF HARD WORK
WHEN YOU GROW UP.

06:22.850 --> 06:26.587
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THIS IS A GREAT JOB.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.990
I WANNA QUIT SCHOOL
AND WORK AT THE FACTORY FOREVER.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.027
GEORGE?

06:34.027 --> 06:36.964
UM, DON'T PANIC.
JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.365
MAX, LISTEN.

06:38.365 --> 06:42.903
UH, YOUR MOTHER HAS SOMETHING
SHE WANTS TO SAY TO YOU.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.640
I AM SO MAD, I CAN'T EVEN
TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.976
TO HIM, TO HIM.

06:55.215 --> 06:58.452
I KNOW YOU HAD A GOOD TIME
WORKING AT THE FACTORY,

06:58.452 --> 07:00.554
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR FUTURE.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.223
WOULD YOU PLEASE
TALK SOME SENSE INTO YOUR SON?

07:03.223 --> 07:06.059
MAX, THERE IS NO WAY
YOU'RE DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.596
BUT I HAVE TO START
MAKING MONEY RIGHT NOW.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.298
SOCIAL SECURITY
IS A PYRAMID SCHEME

07:11.298 --> 07:13.100
BEING GUTTED
BY THE BABY BOOMERS.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.969
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE SAYING?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.471
NO.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.441
SOMEBODY KNOCKED OVER THE RADIO
ON THE LOADING DOCK.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.876
IT'S STUCK ON A.M.

07:22.876 --> 07:27.014
YOU HAVE WORKED TOO HARD
TO QUIT NOW.

07:27.014 --> 07:30.350
YOU ARE GONNA FINISH HIGH SCHOOL
AND GO TO COLLEGE.

07:30.350 --> 07:33.554
BUT THE FACTORY WAS GOOD ENOUGH
FOR DAD AND GRANDMA,

07:33.554 --> 07:35.556
AND THEY HAVE
THIS AWESOME TRUCK

07:35.556 --> 07:37.357
THAT BRINGS FOOD
RIGHT TO THE PARKING LOT.

07:37.357 --> 07:42.863
WITH THE HORN LIKE THAT...
(hums "La Cucaracha")

07:46.366 --> 07:50.270
A TRUCK THAT BRINGS FOOD,

07:50.270 --> 07:52.372
THAT'S YOUR BEST ARGUMENT?

07:52.372 --> 07:54.241
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

07:54.241 --> 07:57.077
THE ROACH COACH IS PRETTY COOL
WHEN YOU FIRST START.

07:57.077 --> 08:00.080
THEN YOU ORDER A SPICY BREAKFAST
BURRITO IN THE MORNING,

08:00.080 --> 08:03.083
AND YOU GO MISSING FOR AN HOUR
AND A HALF IN THE AFTERNOON.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.218
YOU'RE LIKE THAT ALL DAY...
(purrs)

08:06.754 --> 08:08.455
YOU KNOW
WHAT ELSE I LIKE?

08:08.455 --> 08:11.158
WHEN I FINISH SOMETHING,
PEOPLE SAY, "NICE JOB, MAX,"

08:11.158 --> 08:14.562
AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.
I NEVER FEEL THAT WAY AT SCHOOL.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.929
IF YOU KEEP TRYING HARD,

08:15.929 --> 08:19.066
YOU'LL GET THAT FEELING
FROM SCHOOL, TOO.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.735
I ALWAYS TRY HARD,
AND I NEVER FEEL GOOD.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.370
IT'LL BE WORSE IN COLLEGE.

08:23.370 --> 08:26.574
I LIKE GOING TO THE FACTORY
AND HANGING OUT WITH DAD.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.508
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

08:32.580 --> 08:35.382
WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN.

08:35.382 --> 08:38.385
LOOK, MAYBE WE SHOULD LISTEN
TO WHAT HE'S SAYING, ANGIE.

08:38.385 --> 08:39.953
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

08:39.953 --> 08:41.955
YOU KNOW, MAYBE COLLEGE
ISN'T RIGHT FOR MAX.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.625
I MEAN, WE TRIED
TO HELP HIM WITH SCHOOL,

08:44.625 --> 08:46.126
AND THAT HASN'T WORKED OUT.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.929
THE KID I SAW THIS WEEK
WAS A DIFFERENT MAX.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.464
HE WAS WORKING HARD,
AND HE WAS HAPPY.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.000
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.002
DON'T YOU WANT HIM
TO DO BETTER THAN WE DID?

08:55.002 --> 08:57.805
YEAH, I DO, BUT HE HAS TO
WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE, TOO.

08:57.805 --> 09:00.608
WHAT WAS THE LAST BOOK
THAT MAX READ ON HIS OWN?

09:00.608 --> 09:03.777
LET ME GIVE YOU A HINT--
HE DIDN'T READ IT ON A TRAIN,

09:03.777 --> 09:05.779
AND HE DIDN'T READ IT
ON A PLANE.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.782
I'M NOT SAYING HE HAS TO GO
TO AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL,

09:08.782 --> 09:11.484
BUT THERE'S JUNIOR COLLEGE
AND TRADE SCHOOLS.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.286
HE LIKES
TO TAKE APART COMPUTERS.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.789
MAYBE HE CAN LEARN
TO PUT 'EM BACK TOGETHER.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.692
OKAY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH WORKING AT THE FACTORY?

09:18.692 --> 09:21.494
I DID ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE A HOUSE, THREE CARS.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.598
WOULD WE BE IN THIS MUCH DEBT
IF I WASN'T SUCCESSFUL?

09:24.598 --> 09:27.134
HONEY, YOU DID GREAT,

09:27.134 --> 09:31.204
BUT WE CAN GIVE HIM OPTIONS
THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.607
TROUBLE WITH MAX AGAIN?

09:33.607 --> 09:36.176
HE WANTS TO SPEND
THE REST OF HIS LIFE

09:36.176 --> 09:38.178
WORKING AT THE FACTORY
WITH GEORGE.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.180
OH, THANK GOD
HE FOUND SOMETHING.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.582
I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT THAT BOY.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.719
YOU SEE? IT'S NOT JUST ME.
YOUR FATHER SEES IT, TOO.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.755
HE'S NOT GOING BACK
TO THAT FACTORY.

09:47.755 --> 09:50.724
YES, HE IS. LOOK, HE HASN'T
PAID OFF THE COMPUTER.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.893
LOOK, MAX CAN'T DROP OUT
OF HIGH SCHOOL,

09:52.893 --> 09:54.394
BUT AFTER HE GRADUATES,

09:54.394 --> 09:57.597
IF HE WANTS TO WORK
AT THE FACTORY, HE CAN DO IT.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.599
THERE, I CAN KEEP
AN EYE ON HIM.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.601
NO. I HAVE NEVER
GIVEN UP ON MAX,

10:01.601 --> 10:03.403
AND I AM NOT
GONNA START NOW.

10:03.403 --> 10:06.106
THAT'S WHY HE'S POTTY-TRAINED,
KNOWS HIS ABCs,

10:06.106 --> 10:08.441
AND HE CAN WEAR
PANTS WITH ZIPPERS.

10:08.441 --> 10:12.145
HE STILL GETS CAUGHT, ANGIE.
HE STILL GETS CAUGHT.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.121
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
LISTEN UP.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.123
SINCE WE ALL GOT
THE BOEING ORDER

10:23.123 --> 10:25.793
OUT AHEAD OF SCHEDULE,
LUNCH IS ON ME.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.594
(all cheering)

10:27.594 --> 10:28.829
BUT NO ALCOHOL.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.530
(man) AW, COME ON.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.566
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY GOING BACK
TO WORK ALL BUZZED OUT AGAIN.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.235
THE RUNNING OF THE FORKLIFTS
WAS FUN,

10:35.235 --> 10:37.805
BUT I THINK WE ALL AGREE, IT
SHOULD'VE BEEN AN OUTDOOR GAME.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.907
HEY. HEY, GEORGE,
IT'S FRIDAY.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.875
WHO YOU GONNA PICK
AS EMPLOYEE OF THE WEEK?

10:41.875 --> 10:45.145
HEY, I NOMINATE MAX.
ALL RIGHT, MAN.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.848
HEY, I'VE BEEN WORKING
AT THE FACTORY FOR 20 YEARS,

10:47.848 --> 10:49.850
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN
EMPLOYEE OF THE WEEK.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.785
I CAN'T MAKE YOU
EMPLOYEE OF THE WEEK

10:51.785 --> 10:53.921
BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S
GONNA THINK

10:53.921 --> 10:58.525
I'M DOING IT JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.
BUT HE'S YOUR SON.

10:58.525 --> 11:02.595
I KNOW. I'M SO PROUD.

11:02.595 --> 11:05.298
SO YOU'RE OKAY WITH ME
WORKING AT THE FACTORY?

11:05.298 --> 11:08.168
I MADE YOU EMPLOYEE OF THE WEEK,
DIDN'T I? CONGRATULATIONS.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.669
WHAT DO I WIN?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.671
A NIGHT WITH GINA!

11:11.671 --> 11:14.808
(all laugh)

11:14.808 --> 11:17.044
MAN, WATCH THE JOKES.
MAN, THAT'S MY KID.

11:17.044 --> 11:21.148
SHOULDN'T A NIGHT WITHOUT GINA
BE THE PRIZE?

11:21.148 --> 11:22.983
(both laugh)

11:22.983 --> 11:26.519
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ENOUGH.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.321
MOM,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:28.321 --> 11:30.323
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR A JOB.

11:30.323 --> 11:34.327
I AM. I'M GETTING READY
FOR AN INTERVIEW.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.764
BY DRINKING
SHOTS AND BEER?

11:36.764 --> 11:38.799
BECAUSE I'M APPLYING HERE,

11:38.799 --> 11:40.600
AND I WANT TO SHOW THEM

11:40.600 --> 11:43.470
THAT I AM ACQUAINTED
WITH ALL OF THEIR PRODUCTS.

11:43.470 --> 11:49.242
BOY, SEEING MAX HERE REALLY
BRINGS BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.244
I REMEMBER
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE,

11:51.244 --> 11:53.546
I WOULD BRING YOU HERE
AFTER WORK.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.949
YEAH, THE DIFFERENCE IS,

11:55.949 --> 11:58.752
I'M TAKING HIM HOME
FOR DINNER.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.520
WHAT WAS WRONG
WITH EATING HERE?

12:00.520 --> 12:04.424
MOM, THE CELERY OUT OF
YOUR BLOODY MARY IS NOT DINNER,

12:04.424 --> 12:06.626
AND THE LITTLE PLASTIC SWORD
THIS BIG

12:06.626 --> 12:08.628
IS NOT A ROBIN HOOD PLAY SET.

12:08.628 --> 12:09.930
I WAS LIKE THAT...

12:09.930 --> 12:12.599
YOU KNOW WHAT?
A NAPKIN IS NOT A TENT

12:12.599 --> 12:14.267
AND A FLEXI STRAW
IS NOT A SNORKEL.

12:14.267 --> 12:19.072
THERE'S NOTHING SADDER THAN
A CHILD WITHOUT AN IMAGINATION.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.074
YEAH, HOW ABOUT A CHILD
WHO ALMOST DROWNS

12:21.074 --> 12:23.510
WHEN HIS STRAW SNORKEL
WON'T REACH THE SURFACE?

12:23.510 --> 12:26.413
I WAS LIKE THAT... (coughs)

12:26.413 --> 12:27.915
STOP IT.

12:27.915 --> 12:30.918
HEY, UH, I HEAR THAT
THE PRINCESS IS NOT HAPPY

12:30.918 --> 12:33.020
ABOUT MAX WORKING
IN THE FACTORY.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.888
NO, SHE THINKS
HE SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE,

12:34.888 --> 12:36.890
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT SO SURE.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.658
LOOK, YOU ARE RIGHT,
AND ANGIE'S WRONG.

12:38.658 --> 12:42.329
SHE'S ONE OF THOSE IDIOTS
WHO THINKS THAT, YOU KNOW,

12:42.329 --> 12:44.998
YOUR KID CAN GROW UP
TO BE ANYTHING THEY WANT.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.000
OOH, I'M GONNA BE PRESIDENT.
GUESS WHAT.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.301
THERE'S ONLY ONE PRESIDENT,

12:48.301 --> 12:50.370
AND THERE ARE MILLIONS
OF FACTORY WORKERS.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.640
PICK A FREAKIN' TARGET
YOU CAN HIT.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.809
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG

12:55.809 --> 12:58.879
WITH MAX HAVING HIS FUTURE
LOCKED IN.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.881
(man)
HEY, NICE SHOT, MAX.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.850
(Max) THANKS.
RACK 'EM UP, ERNIE.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.617
(Ernie) Ã³RALE, Â¿SABES QUÃ©?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.619
MR. EMPLOYEE OF THE WEEK.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.789
OH, THERE WE ARE.
ALL RIGHT.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.992
(billiard balls rattling)

13:16.029 --> 13:19.933
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
TO RACK BALLS, ERNIE?

13:19.933 --> 13:22.335
THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.404
(chuckles)
THANKS, BUDDY.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.873
(laughs)

13:25.873 --> 13:28.241
YOU DON'T REMEMBER MY NAME,
DO YOU?

13:28.241 --> 13:30.710
NOPE.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.346
YOU ARE OLD AND PATHETIC.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.551
(inhales deeply)

13:38.551 --> 13:41.088
AHH! THAT'S BETTER.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.056
MOM, WHERE YOU GOING?

13:43.056 --> 13:44.858
OH, I GOT A DATE.

13:44.858 --> 13:49.196
I GOTTA GO HOME AND PAINT
MY NAILS SO THEY MATCH MY TANK.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.298
WHY DON'T YOU PAINT
A FACE ON IT,

13:51.298 --> 13:54.935
SO THE GUY THINKS
HE'S DATING SISTERS?

13:54.935 --> 13:58.505
YOU CAN JUMP OH HIM WHILE HE'S
FLIRTING WITH THE PRETTY ONE.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.609
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
I GOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.811
(gasps)
IS IT EMPLOYEE OF THE WEEK?

14:04.811 --> 14:06.746
DID I FINALLY WIN?

14:06.746 --> 14:08.882
NO, ERNIE, MAX WON AGAIN.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.317
DAMN IT!

14:10.317 --> 14:12.986
I'VE BEEN WORKING AT THE FACTORY
FOR 50 YEARS.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.988
WHEN IS IT GONNA BE MY TURN?

14:14.988 --> 14:17.790
AND WHO'S MAX?

14:17.790 --> 14:21.528
ERNIE, I'M TAKING NEXT WEEK OFF,
SO YOU'RE A SURE THING.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.331
ACTUALLY, WE'RE ALL
TAKING NEXT WEEK OFF.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.533
THEY'RE AUTOMATING
THE FACTORY AND....

14:26.533 --> 14:29.369
WE'RE ALL LOSING OUR JOBS
TO ROBOTS.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.670
(all groan)

14:30.670 --> 14:32.572
(woman) YOU'RE KIDDING.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.607
AW, DAMN IT!

14:34.607 --> 14:36.176
HEY.

14:36.176 --> 14:41.581
I SAY WE GO OVER TO THEIR BAR
AND KICK SOME ROBOT ASS.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.882
ARE YOU CRAZY?

14:42.882 --> 14:46.086
YOU WANT TO GO TO THE RO-BARRIO
AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT?

14:46.086 --> 14:49.722
GET A DRIVE-BY LASER.
(imitates laser buzzing)

14:49.722 --> 14:51.524
WHAT AM I GONNA DO, DAD?

14:51.524 --> 14:53.726
I'VE BEEN AT THE FACTORY
FOR 30 YEARS.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.996
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.497
LOOK, I'M SORRY, MAX,

14:57.497 --> 15:01.601
BUT ALL THE UNSKILLED LABOR
IS GOING TO MARTIANS.

15:01.601 --> 15:05.138
THOSE DAMN ILLEGAL ALIENS.

15:05.138 --> 15:09.209
WELL, I GUESS I COULD ALWAYS
GO BACK TO DANCING.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.479
I'VE GOT THE SAME BODY
THAT I HAD BACK IN '07.

15:15.582 --> 15:19.186
1907 OR 2007?

15:19.186 --> 15:21.888
THE ANSWER IS YES.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.490
HEY, KID.

15:23.490 --> 15:27.027
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WORK,
I COULD USE A POOL BOY.

15:27.027 --> 15:31.098
SURE. WHY NOT?

15:31.098 --> 15:32.932
MAX, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.934
I HAVE NO OPTIONS, DAD.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.369
THANKS A LOT.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.547
HEY, I'M HEADING BACK.
THANKS FOR LUNCH, GEORGE.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.416
WHERE'S MAX?

15:49.416 --> 15:52.919
OH, FRANK GAVE HIM A RIDE
BACK TO WORK. EVERYTHING OKAY?

15:52.919 --> 15:54.988
I GOTTA GET HIM OUT
OF THAT FACTORY.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.323
WAIT, GEORGE.
WHAT'S--WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:56.323 --> 15:58.791
IT'S WEIRD, MAN.
I-I-I HAD A VISION, MAN.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.328
I SAW INTO THE FUTURE.
OH, HEY, WHAT HAPPENS TO ME?

16:01.328 --> 16:04.331
DO I GET A WIFE
AND WIND UP HAPPY?

16:04.331 --> 16:08.535
YOU MARRY
A RICH SWIMSUIT MODEL!

16:08.535 --> 16:10.937
OH, YES! (laughs)

16:10.937 --> 16:13.340
IT'S A DUDE.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.609
HOW RICH?

16:25.552 --> 16:27.754
YOU PAID OFF THE COMPUTER.
YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSON.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.023
YOU'RE FIRED.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.324
FIRED?

16:31.324 --> 16:33.593
YOU MADE ME
EMPLOYEE OF THE WEEK.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.329
THAT'S JUST A TITLE
TO KEEP PEOPLE HAPPY.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.332
YOU REALLY THINK YOUR MOM
IS "THE WORLD'S GREATEST WIFE"?

16:39.332 --> 16:43.670
THEY SELL THOSE TROPHIES
AT THE CAR WASH. NOW GO.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.072
I DON'T GET IT.

16:45.072 --> 16:48.475
LOOK, YOUR MOM WAS RIGHT, MAX.
YOU NEED TO HAVE OPTIONS.

16:48.475 --> 16:51.878
FINE, BUT THE DAY I GRADUATE
HIGH SCHOOL, I'M COMING BACK,

16:51.878 --> 16:53.346
AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.350
HEY, MAX. MAX!

16:57.350 --> 16:59.952
MAYBE YOU NEED TO HEAR THIS
FROM SOMEBODY ELSE. ERNIE.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.754
WHAT'S GOING ON, GEORGE?
YOU KNOW HOW

17:01.754 --> 17:04.191
THERE'S ALWAYS RUMORS
THAT THE FACTORY'S CLOSING?

17:04.191 --> 17:07.227
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF THAT REALLY HAPPENED?
WELL, I GUESS IF THE FACTORY
CLOSED DOWN,

17:07.227 --> 17:09.696
I'D HAVE TO MOVE
BACK IN WITH MY FOLKS.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.999
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.
HEY, DID I JUST HEAR YOU SAY
THE FACTORY'S CLOSING DOWN?

17:12.999 --> 17:15.968
NO, JUST TALKING ABOUT
HOW THERE'S ALWAYS RUMORS

17:15.968 --> 17:18.705
THAT THE FACTORY'S CLOSING.
WELL, I NEVER HEARD
THOSE RUMORS.

17:18.705 --> 17:21.174
IF I LOSE THIS JOB,
I'M SCREWED.
WHO'S LOSING THEIR JOB?

17:21.174 --> 17:24.111
WELL, MAYBE ALL OF US
IF THE RUMORS ARE TRUE.
THE RUMORS AREN'T TRUE.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.413
WHAT RUMORS?
THE FACTORY'S CLOSING.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.648
IT IS?
LOOK, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.150
I GOTTA KNOW, GEORGE.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.452
I MEAN, IF I GOTTA
GO BACK TO DANCING,

17:32.452 --> 17:35.188
I GOTTA GET MY SNAKE BACK
FROM MY SISTER.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.924
MAX, IF SHE HAD GOTTEN
AN EDUCATION,

17:37.924 --> 17:40.593
SHE WOULDN'T BE PANICKED
ABOUT LOSING HER JOB.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.095
OH, MY GOD!

17:42.095 --> 17:44.697
WE'RE LOSING OUR JOBS.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

17:44.697 --> 17:48.000
THE FACTORY'S CLOSING!
GRAB ALL THE HAND TOOLS!

17:48.000 --> 17:50.137
(man) COME ON!

17:50.137 --> 17:51.438
STOP!

17:51.438 --> 17:55.007
STOP! THE FACTORY
IS NOT CLOSING.

17:55.007 --> 17:57.144
IT'S A MISUNDERSTANDING.

17:57.144 --> 18:00.113
PLEASE, EVERYBODY,
GO BACK TO WORK.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.555
DAD, WHY DID EVERYONE
GET SO SCARED?

18:08.555 --> 18:13.593
WELL, FIRST, THEY PROBABLY
PICTURED GINA DANCING.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.994
AND SECOND,

18:14.994 --> 18:17.564
LOOK, THEY DIDN'T HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU HAVE

18:17.564 --> 18:19.666
TO GET AN EDUCATION
AND HAVE CHOICES.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.068
YOU SEE HOW FREAKED OUT
THEY GOT?

18:22.068 --> 18:25.037
YOU WANT THAT TO BE YOU?

18:25.037 --> 18:26.038
NO.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.540
YOU'RE LUCKY, MAX.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.442
YOUR DADDY'S
A VERY SMART MAN.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.078
CAN I TALK TO YOU A MINUTE?

18:32.078 --> 18:34.381
SURE.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.019
BOY, THAT WAS CRAZY
OUT THERE, HUH?

18:40.019 --> 18:41.821
I TRIED TO TEACH MAX A LESSON

18:41.821 --> 18:45.258
AND BOOM,
EVERYBODY WENT NUTS.
HOW'D YOU FIND OUT?

18:47.160 --> 18:49.162
HOW'D I FIND WHAT OUT?

18:49.162 --> 18:50.663
WE JUST GOT BOUGHT OUT

18:50.663 --> 18:52.665
BY A BIG MEXICAN CORPORATION--
AeroMayan.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.167
THEY'RE
CUTTING EVERYBODY LOOSE,

18:54.167 --> 18:56.703
MOVING THE FACTORY
DOWN TO MEXICO.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.238
THE RUMORS ARE TRUE?

18:58.238 --> 18:59.806
OH, YEAH.

18:59.806 --> 19:04.076
THEY BACKED UP THE PESO WAGON
AND LET ME GO LOCO. (laughs)

19:04.076 --> 19:07.146
SORRY. SORRY, GEORGE.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.949
WH--

19:09.949 --> 19:11.751
WHAT ARE WE ALL
SUPPOSED TO DO?

19:11.751 --> 19:14.787
LOOK, I FEEL BAD,
BUT IT'S BUSINESS, GEORGE.

19:16.789 --> 19:20.493
LOOK, I BETTER GO
BREAK THE NEWS TO EVERYBODY.

19:22.495 --> 19:27.867
GEORGE... YOU'VE BEEN
A HELL OF A MANAGER.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.202
WHEREVER YOU END UP,

19:29.202 --> 19:31.204
THEY'RE GONNA BE LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.206
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.425
EVERYONE'S
STILL FREAKING OUT.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.794
I THINK I WANT
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.463
THAT'S GREAT, MAX.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.631
YOU'VE BEEN
A HELL OF A SON.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.768
WHEREVER YOU END UP,
THEY'LL BE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

20:06.005 --> 20:06.973
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
