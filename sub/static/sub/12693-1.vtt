A WIFE'S SUSPICION
Translation. Review by Angel.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.504
There are no
footings!

01:12.605 --> 01:14.807
Calm down, honey.

01:14.908 --> 01:15.808
Up to your right.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.259
Right there, up
to your right.

01:20.457 --> 01:21.857
That is it.

01:21.881 --> 01:23.649
Jack, I cannot!

01:23.750 --> 01:25.651
You can do
it, Renee.

01:34.071 --> 01:35.471
Jack?

01:35.495 --> 01:36.895
I got you!

01:39.677 --> 01:41.127
I got you, honey.
I got you.

01:41.151 --> 01:42.584
Are you okay?

01:42.635 --> 01:44.103
Yeah.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.038
Yeah.

01:46.139 --> 01:48.974
Nothing like a
Sunday climb.

01:49.075 --> 01:52.144
Hang on! I am going to start
pulling you up, okay?

01:52.245 --> 01:53.712
Are you ready?

01:53.813 --> 01:56.982
I got you. Ready?
Here we go.

02:04.724 --> 02:06.692
That is it.
That is it.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.132
- That was crazy.
- Right?

02:13.233 --> 02:14.833
I thought I was
going to fall.

02:14.934 --> 02:18.137
- I am so proud of you.
- Whew!

02:18.238 --> 02:20.780
I do not know how you think I
am going to make it back down.

02:20.800 --> 02:24.843
Well, I guess I am just going to
have to leave you up here then.

02:24.944 --> 02:26.912
You do not dare.

02:27.013 --> 02:30.413
You do not worry, there is a path
that leads down to the parking lot.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.386
That was great.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.455
Always prepared.

02:40.070 --> 02:41.470
This is so
beautiful.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.427
It is.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.730
Let us just stay up
here for a bit, okay?

02:46.633 --> 02:49.535
Speaking of
beautiful.

02:49.636 --> 02:53.605
We should probably
take this off.

02:53.706 --> 02:55.507
That better be all
you are taking.

02:55.575 --> 02:57.509
Come on.

02:57.610 --> 02:58.810
There is no
one up here.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.979
Come on, we are alone. 
Who would see?

03:01.080 --> 03:02.614
Jack.

03:07.053 --> 03:08.987
Carabiners, colors
of the rainbow, go!

03:09.088 --> 03:12.691
Red, orange, yellow,
green and blue.

03:17.407 --> 03:18.807
Well done!

03:18.831 --> 03:20.465
Thank you.

03:23.903 --> 03:25.904
I love you.

03:26.005 --> 03:28.040
I love you.

03:44.946 --> 03:46.946
POLICE

03:54.500 --> 03:56.250
Tim, do you have
those test results…

03:56.274 --> 03:57.552
back from the
Ridley case?

03:57.554 --> 03:58.537
Sure, boss.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.972
Great!

03:59.973 --> 04:02.107
Congratulations,
too, by the way.

04:02.308 --> 04:03.875
Thank you.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.480
May I say what an honor? It
has been to work with you…

04:08.692 --> 04:10.092
these past
couple of years.

04:10.116 --> 04:13.452
I feel very lucky to have
learned from such a...

04:13.553 --> 04:16.454
Such a consummate
professional, so thank you.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.206
Flattery will get
you everywhere.

04:19.225 --> 04:21.560
- Get back to work.
- Roger that, boss.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.029
Yeah, I do not like
when you call me boss.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.664
Sorry.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.054
<I>Everyone knows that
we have the best…</I>

04:33.078 --> 04:35.040
<I>forensic team
on the force.</I>

04:35.141 --> 04:37.976
I want to give props to my
partner, Detective Ferguson.

04:38.177 --> 04:40.178
His relentless work
and hard evidence...

04:40.280 --> 04:43.348
was just the dagger we
needed to put this guy away.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.617
Thank you,
Detective Knox.

04:45.718 --> 04:48.687
It is always a pleasure to
catch criminals with you, too.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.757
And Renee, your chain of
custody on the DNA evidence...

04:51.858 --> 04:54.893
really helped nail the
case shut, so good work.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.595
I was just doing
my job, Kyle.

04:56.696 --> 05:01.696
Okay, drinks on Ferguson
Billy Miner Pub, tonight!

05:04.504 --> 05:06.705
Wow!

05:06.806 --> 05:09.875
By the way, I put a word
in for that promotion.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.510
Why would you
do that?

05:11.611 --> 05:14.513
Well, I was just
trying to help.

05:14.614 --> 05:17.149
I am good, Kyle.

05:18.885 --> 05:21.053
All right!

05:24.234 --> 05:25.634
Give it up,
Ferguson.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.408
She dumped your ass
a long time ago.

05:27.432 --> 05:30.267
Yeah.

05:32.994 --> 05:34.394
ALE HOUSE

05:37.337 --> 05:39.638
Cheers!

05:39.739 --> 05:41.173
Cheers!

05:41.274 --> 05:43.124
You would have made
a great detective.

05:43.148 --> 05:45.110
You know that's
not my thing.

05:45.211 --> 05:46.912
I like my science.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.414
Matching DNA,
identifying fibers.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.249
Stop, please.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.201
It is amazing to me
that you managed…

05:53.225 --> 05:56.288
to take that lab coat off and
actually marry your man.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.490
Honestly, it is a
miracle, truly.

05:58.591 --> 06:00.625
Is not it six
months next week?

06:00.727 --> 06:04.029
Is it already?

06:04.130 --> 06:06.631
And by the way, my
job is not boring.

06:06.733 --> 06:08.667
See, that is why
I love you.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.268
She is crazy.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.971
You have it all now.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.207
How is it going
with Kyle?

06:15.308 --> 06:16.341
What do you mean?

06:16.442 --> 06:19.177
Well, you married his
best friend, or...

06:19.278 --> 06:20.912
Ex-best friend now.

06:26.652 --> 06:30.355
They, I mean, they do not hang
out, or go climbing anymore.

06:30.456 --> 06:33.525
However, I think that
has to be expected.

06:35.595 --> 06:39.131
Time does heal.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.833
Well, hello, women,
room for one more?

06:41.934 --> 06:43.334
Yeah, of course!

06:43.403 --> 06:47.105
- Hey, honey.
- Hey. Hi.

06:47.206 --> 06:49.408
Congrats on cracking
another case.

06:49.509 --> 06:50.609
Thanks. Thank you.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.310
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.480
- It was a team effort.
- Yeah.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.949
Catch you all later.

06:58.050 --> 07:00.051
- Come on, Kyle.
- Yeah, stay.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.153
I got a friend waiting
for me at the bar.

07:02.287 --> 07:04.487
I have already kept him
waiting long enough.

07:04.511 --> 07:05.791
Wait!

07:05.892 --> 07:08.894
Renee, we should have
everyone over for dinner.

07:08.995 --> 07:10.629
To celebrate.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.931
It sounds great!

07:12.999 --> 07:14.800
Good.

07:14.901 --> 07:16.468
We will see you
later, then.

07:16.569 --> 07:17.969
Yeah.

07:21.340 --> 07:24.710
Do not you think
this is too soon?

07:25.011 --> 07:28.447
We have kept to ourselves
for the past few months.

07:28.548 --> 07:30.982
Look, enough time
has passed, honey.

07:31.083 --> 07:34.019
It will be good
for all of us.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.854
Trust me.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.823
- All right!
- All right!

07:42.762 --> 07:44.429
- I…I disagree.
- Yeah?

07:44.530 --> 07:46.531
Come here.

08:01.714 --> 08:05.817
Anywhere in the world, where
would you want to go?

08:05.918 --> 08:08.854
- Thailand.
- Thailand?

08:10.122 --> 08:11.923
Hold that thought.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.695
Not tonight.

08:16.796 --> 08:19.564
- What if is it work?
- What if is it not?

08:21.267 --> 08:23.201
Come here.

08:27.707 --> 08:31.176
- All right!
- Thank you.

08:49.061 --> 08:50.462
Murphy.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.266
Yeah, I got it.

09:00.220 --> 09:03.220
CRIME SCENE
DO NOT CROSS

09:07.046 --> 09:08.813
So, what do we have?

09:08.915 --> 09:10.315
No sign of
forced entry...

09:10.383 --> 09:12.551
- No struggle.
- That is conjecture.

09:12.652 --> 09:14.352
Let us find some
hard evidence.

09:15.616 --> 09:17.266
I talked to the
building manager…

09:17.290 --> 09:18.456
about the
surveillance tapes.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.958
- Anything?
- Nothing yet.

09:19.992 --> 09:21.760
Let us go talk to
the neighbors.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.985
Taking trophies,
are we?

10:30.896 --> 10:33.696
Therefore, what, you think
somebody accessed the balcony,

10:33.733 --> 10:35.266
from up here?

10:35.368 --> 10:38.036
It is possible.

10:48.714 --> 10:51.883
Looks like the markings
of a thick rope.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.452
Could it be the
window washer?

10:54.553 --> 10:56.121
No, it is a
single rope.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.123
I got something.

11:01.238 --> 11:02.638
What is it?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.229
It is a carabiner.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.965
Climbers use them to keep
tension on the ropes.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.000
Looks like we found
point of entry...

11:09.101 --> 11:11.751
Whoever killed our victim
repelled down the building,

11:11.775 --> 11:13.405
In addition, onto
the balcony.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.939
Well, well.

11:17.243 --> 11:19.343
I have done some pretty
interesting climbs.

11:19.367 --> 11:23.515
However, I have to tell
you, whoever did this…

11:23.616 --> 11:25.817
got to give them
points for creativity.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.601
Do you see anything?

11:45.071 --> 11:46.538
See what you
can pull…

11:46.639 --> 11:49.808
then let us get this off to
the lab for possible DNA.

11:52.411 --> 11:55.380
Hey. Did you
get anything?

11:55.381 --> 11:57.449
Well, nothing yet, but we're
still working the evidence.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.900
However, that murder scene
was unusually clean.

11:59.924 --> 12:01.786
No prints, no
fibers, no hairs.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.888
Just the carabiner
that Kyle found.

12:03.989 --> 12:06.057
No signs of
struggle?

12:06.158 --> 12:08.393
Did you get the results back
from the coroner's office?

12:08.494 --> 12:10.328
Yeah, preliminary said there
was no drug in her system,

12:10.429 --> 12:12.430
Moreover, we are still waiting
for the full report but...

12:12.531 --> 12:14.131
Well, whoever did
this was good.

12:14.182 --> 12:16.732
It is almost impossible not
to leave trace evidence…

12:16.756 --> 12:17.886
at a crime scene.

12:18.037 --> 12:21.239
This is definitely not
the work of an amateur.

12:24.721 --> 12:26.121
Hey, baby.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.779
I have to go.

12:29.181 --> 12:30.749
Hey, honey.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.851
How was your day?

12:35.354 --> 12:36.888
How was yours?

12:37.089 --> 12:38.623
Well, we just
found out...

12:38.724 --> 12:40.458
that the shipment is going
to be late from China...

12:40.559 --> 12:41.826
which is causing a
lot more headaches,

12:41.927 --> 12:44.095
because of the server
breakdown, but..

12:44.196 --> 12:46.798
- I am sorry to hear.
- It will be fine.

12:46.899 --> 12:48.099
- Hungry?
- Starving.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.535
- Order in.
- Done.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.518
It is like a cat,
and a mouse.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.419
It takes a sophisticated mind
to leave the crime's scene,

13:09.443 --> 13:11.189
without any trace
of evidence.

13:11.390 --> 13:14.225
I mean, those are clear markers
that whoever did this...

13:14.326 --> 13:16.594
wants us to
follow them.

13:16.695 --> 13:19.231
Who?

13:19.632 --> 13:22.033
The killer. Jack?

13:23.169 --> 13:24.636
Right.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.271
I have to get this.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.841
Yeah?

13:34.513 --> 13:35.980
I will be
right there.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.450
I have to head back
to the office.

13:39.551 --> 13:41.951
Our junior tech working
nights just screwed up...

13:41.975 --> 13:43.638
the server problem
even more.

13:43.789 --> 13:45.957
Well, cannot
somebody else do it?

13:48.194 --> 13:50.094
Renee, I designed
the system.

13:50.196 --> 13:53.198
I am the only one who can
go inside and fix it.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.400
I am sorry! It is
just the way it is.

13:55.701 --> 13:59.204
How many night late crime
scenes have I attended, right?

13:59.205 --> 14:01.372
Seven over the
last twelve weeks.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.275
Nevertheless, who is counting?
I will talk to you later.

14:04.476 --> 14:06.678
Send me updates.

15:05.704 --> 15:09.374
Red, orange, yellow,
green, and blue.

15:29.572 --> 15:30.972
Hey.

15:30.996 --> 15:32.563
Hi.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.366
- Coffee?
- Yes.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.873
What is up?

15:42.074 --> 15:44.042
You seem stressed.

15:44.944 --> 15:48.146
Just have my head in
the case. That is all.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.782
Are you sure,
that is it?

15:51.083 --> 15:52.784
I did not sleep
last night.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.424
Jack never
came home.

15:59.525 --> 16:01.975
I mean, how many times I
have gone off on a case,

16:01.999 --> 16:05.163
and I do not even come back
until the next night, right?

16:05.564 --> 16:06.497
Yeah.

16:06.598 --> 16:08.399
Moreover, marriage
is about trust,

16:08.500 --> 16:10.500
because you are in it
for the long haul.

16:10.552 --> 16:13.002
In addition, let us face
it you are better off it.

16:13.026 --> 16:13.776
I mean, Kyle.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.808
He must have
been a handful.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.143
You do not get me wrong,
I trust the person...

16:18.644 --> 16:22.981
with my life, but
outside of work?

16:23.582 --> 16:26.284
Kyle is great with
his daughter, Sage.

16:26.385 --> 16:27.585
She adores him.

16:27.686 --> 16:31.256
He is a different
person outside of work.

16:31.457 --> 16:35.593
I know that his wife is
death hit him hard, but...

16:35.894 --> 16:37.595
It is Kyle.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.876
Therefore, what do
we have so far?

16:51.977 --> 16:53.727
Victim's name is
Jessica Grigson...

16:53.751 --> 16:56.447
Thirty-two, lawyer,
no priors.

16:56.548 --> 16:59.050
No family that we
can find as of yet.

16:59.151 --> 17:01.753
Cause of death
was strangulation.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.604
The perp came in
through the roof...

17:03.705 --> 17:04.739
climbed down the side
of the building...

17:04.839 --> 17:06.457
into the victim's
balcony.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.760
Coroner said there were very
few signs of a struggle...

17:08.861 --> 17:10.828
very few ligature
marks on the body.

17:10.929 --> 17:13.698
The hemorrhage indicates one
instance of strangulation.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.598
I mean, if it was a
possible sex game...

17:15.666 --> 17:17.635
there would be numerous
attempts where he allows her...

17:17.736 --> 17:19.069
to regain consciousness
in between.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.039
Well, the coroner report has
not come back final yet.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.707
So let us just
stay on topic.

17:22.808 --> 17:25.058
I know I have seen this
rope placement before.

17:25.082 --> 17:26.911
Look at the facts,
not theories.

17:27.012 --> 17:28.279
I am going to go through
the cold cases.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.348
- Renee.
- I have seen this before.

17:30.349 --> 17:31.349
Kyle let her finish.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.884
I...I am the lead
detective on this case.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.885
That means follow my lead,
not follow your imagination.

17:35.909 --> 17:37.322
I am in charge.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.173
Then you know that when a
murderer uses a rope...

17:40.197 --> 17:42.660
much like a knife,
it is personal.

17:42.661 --> 17:44.495
Look at this
binding.

17:44.496 --> 17:49.300
It is meticulous, methodical,
very precise, premeditated.

17:49.601 --> 17:53.271
In addition, the chunk of hair he
is taking as a trophy post-mortem.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.106
This person is
playing us.

17:55.207 --> 17:56.874
Are you done yet?

17:59.912 --> 18:04.515
Okay, so does anyone else have
any ideas, theories? Kyle?

18:04.616 --> 18:07.216
I have to get back to work,
and find some real clues.

18:13.225 --> 18:17.829
- Renee.
- Kyle.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.880
What do you think
you are doing?

18:19.981 --> 18:21.215
Communicating
my findings.

18:21.316 --> 18:23.901
That is not communicating,
that is dictating.

18:24.002 --> 18:26.337
And sometimes these
creative ideas of yours...

18:26.438 --> 18:29.006
lead us down a road
away from the facts.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.541
In addition,
yours do not.

18:30.642 --> 18:32.677
I chase the facts.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.479
I produce results.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.680
Look, I am just giving
credible evidence...

18:36.704 --> 18:40.384
to help us catch a
killer. That is my job.

18:40.486 --> 18:43.036
And if you are having a hard
time separating work...

18:43.060 --> 18:44.805
from our past..

18:44.857 --> 18:46.691
You are right.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.292
I am sorry.

18:49.862 --> 18:53.064
Maybe I am guilty of
still caring a bit.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.335
But this is still my
investigation.

18:57.436 --> 18:59.470
I know.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.706
I am sorry, too.

19:01.907 --> 19:05.109
However, let us just focus
on finding the killer.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.613
I agreed.

19:08.714 --> 19:11.349
- Are we good?
- Yeah.

19:24.863 --> 19:27.498
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I am fine.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.133
You know, he is just jealous
because your forensic work...

19:29.234 --> 19:32.537
is saving all his
cases, right?

19:33.038 --> 19:35.139
What is wrong?

19:35.240 --> 19:37.790
Are you getting over-involved
in this case already?

19:37.814 --> 19:40.428
Look! I just… I know I
have seen that before.

19:40.479 --> 19:43.314
It is as if it is in the back of
my head and I cannot pull it out.

19:43.415 --> 19:44.882
Renee, remember the last
time you got obsessed...

19:44.983 --> 19:47.133
with a case, and you
asked me to tell you...

19:47.157 --> 19:49.521
When it was
happening again?

19:50.622 --> 19:52.823
Therefore, it is
happening again.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.893
Maybe I am too obsessive
for my own good.

19:58.096 --> 19:59.764
Moreover, maybe
Kyle is right.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.500
Just concentrate
on the facts.

20:06.471 --> 20:09.140
Whoever did this, we
are going to get him.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.290
Tim, where is the
Grigson file?

20:26.391 --> 20:27.291
Apologies.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.960
Detective
Ferguson asked...

20:29.027 --> 20:31.629
for some other case
files done pronto.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.164
I... I got behind.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.866
Well, you can tell Detective
Ferguson that he needs to ask me.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.818
Before he tells my department,
what they should be doing.

20:38.842 --> 20:40.605
- Okay?
- Copy that, yeah.

20:40.706 --> 20:42.773
Do we get any DNA back
on the carabiner?

20:42.774 --> 20:45.877
I... I did not get a
chance to get it off yet.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.582
Did you pull
a print?

20:51.683 --> 20:53.833
Yeah, but I was only
able to pull a partial,

20:53.857 --> 20:56.270
and unfortunately it
is not enough to...

20:56.321 --> 20:58.789
to pull a print
from our database.

20:58.890 --> 21:02.326
Tim, everything needs to be
checked and vetted, okay?

21:02.427 --> 21:04.427
Moreover, I need you
to pull cold cases.

21:04.451 --> 21:07.465
All the murders of women
in the past five years.

21:07.566 --> 21:10.234
In addition, get
this to the lab.

21:24.049 --> 21:25.516
Hey.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.053
Hey.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.291
I did not mean
to wake you.

21:33.392 --> 21:36.294
Where have you been?

21:36.662 --> 21:38.396
Where have you been?

21:41.133 --> 21:43.301
Honey, look...

21:43.602 --> 21:45.970
I am sorry about
the other night.

21:46.805 --> 21:50.041
I lost track
of time.

21:50.142 --> 21:53.844
It looks like we both
need boundaries at work.

21:55.747 --> 21:59.283
It is that crazy work
ethic gene of ours.

21:59.384 --> 22:01.285
We got too much
of it, right.

22:05.090 --> 22:07.758
I am sorry.

22:07.859 --> 22:09.860
I am sorry, too.

22:11.596 --> 22:13.831
I love you.

22:13.932 --> 22:16.467
I love you, too.

22:16.568 --> 22:18.336
Come to bed.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.511
<i>Well! She has got
him well trained.</i>

22:27.612 --> 22:30.448
He loves to cook. He
could be more perfect.

22:30.549 --> 22:32.883
- Seriously?
- Apparently not.

22:32.984 --> 22:35.820
Okay, intelligent,
athletic.

22:35.921 --> 22:39.457
In addition, he is a
successful entrepreneur.

22:39.558 --> 22:42.426
Hey, Jade. I have not seen
you at the precinct lately.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.695
Yeah, I have been out
on surveillance.

22:44.796 --> 22:48.232
Not my favorite,
but duty calls.

22:49.835 --> 22:52.002
I will get that.

23:00.345 --> 23:04.682
- Renee!
- Sage!

23:06.184 --> 23:09.320
You are more beautiful
every time I see you.

23:09.932 --> 23:11.332
Are you still
running track?

23:11.356 --> 23:13.290
Yeah, we have a race
next week.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.892
Can you come?

23:15.394 --> 23:17.395
We are pretty
busy at work.

23:18.630 --> 23:20.965
However... I
will try.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.333
Okay.

23:22.434 --> 23:24.684
Everyone is in the back.
Can I take your coat?

23:24.708 --> 23:25.653
Yeah. Thanks.

23:25.704 --> 23:27.972
You have a
beautiful house.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.074
Thank you, sweetie.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.547
She is something.

23:36.648 --> 23:38.048
Her Mommy would
be proud.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.251
Yeah, I wish Holly
were alive to see her.

23:40.352 --> 23:42.352
She could use another
female influence...

23:42.376 --> 23:43.954
in her life.

23:44.055 --> 23:46.123
Well, maybe I could
take her shopping,

23:46.224 --> 23:48.025
or to the park
sometime?

23:48.126 --> 23:50.594
Renee that would
be great, really.

23:50.695 --> 23:52.663
Hey, Kyle.

23:52.964 --> 23:54.965
I am glad you people
could make it.

23:55.066 --> 23:57.067
Jack.

23:57.613 --> 23:59.013
Scotch?

23:59.037 --> 24:01.387
- Yeah, this sounds great.
- Right this way.

24:10.515 --> 24:12.016
Jade?

24:12.984 --> 24:14.985
Are you looking
for something?

24:15.086 --> 24:17.421
I just needed
my phone.

24:17.522 --> 24:19.890
You know me, I cannot
go anywhere without it.

24:32.838 --> 24:35.105
The barbecue
was amazing.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.041
Thank you.

24:37.943 --> 24:39.677
I am glad.
You're welcome!

24:41.713 --> 24:44.515
Sage was so sweet,
do not you think?

24:44.616 --> 24:46.866
I am going to take her
to the park on Sunday.

24:50.722 --> 24:52.723
Are you sure, that
is such a good idea?

24:53.692 --> 24:56.126
Why would not it be?

24:56.228 --> 24:58.395
Well, things are
still a little...

24:58.497 --> 25:00.965
uncomfortable
with Kyle.

25:01.066 --> 25:03.067
I thought they were
better tonight.

25:04.369 --> 25:06.871
However, this is not
about Kyle.

25:06.972 --> 25:09.206
Sage caught
in the crossfire,

25:09.307 --> 25:10.808
and I miss her.

25:10.909 --> 25:12.409
Okay.

25:13.979 --> 25:15.579
Jack?

25:15.680 --> 25:17.848
She is a
little girl.

25:17.949 --> 25:19.950
I understand.

25:26.091 --> 25:28.341
I was thinking. I want
us to start planning...

25:28.365 --> 25:30.266
that vacation to
see your family.

25:32.631 --> 25:34.698
Yeah. Sure, that
would be great.

25:34.799 --> 25:36.534
However... it has
been a long day.

25:36.635 --> 25:38.102
Been cooking all day, and
I got some work to do.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.937
Can we talk about
it tomorrow?

25:40.038 --> 25:41.872
Please?

25:42.807 --> 25:45.075
Okay.

25:45.176 --> 25:47.276
Good. I am just going
to get ready for bed.

26:01.259 --> 26:02.909
<i>There is a school
dance coming up.</i>

26:02.933 --> 26:05.145
That sounds fun.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.297
Do you have a date?

26:06.398 --> 26:07.665
Renee.

26:07.766 --> 26:09.700
Yeah, it is a lot.

26:09.801 --> 26:11.802
However, I am looking
forward to it all.

26:13.171 --> 26:15.873
Hey, you know that if you
ever want to ask me anything.

26:15.974 --> 26:18.742
You just have
to call, right?

26:18.843 --> 26:21.478
Well, I do have a question
that I wanted to ask…

26:21.580 --> 26:23.581
for a while.

26:24.616 --> 26:26.116
Okay, what is it?

26:27.218 --> 26:29.486
Why you married Jack
and not my Daddy?

26:31.523 --> 26:32.991
Honey.

26:33.792 --> 26:36.542
I am so sorry; I did not talk
to you about this before.

26:37.495 --> 26:40.164
Your Daddy and I just
were not getting along.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.500
You still work
together, though.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.938
It is complicated,
Sage.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.644
Well, what did
your Daddy say?

26:56.147 --> 26:58.916
He said you did not
like him anymore.

26:59.017 --> 27:01.018
Well, that
is not true.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.621
He is a good Daddy.

27:03.722 --> 27:05.689
However, what I
know for sure.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.792
He has one amazing
daughter.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.174
Morgan, hey, I
am so sorry.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.009
I forgot to
call you.

27:25.210 --> 27:27.510
<i>It is all right. Do you
still want to meet up?</i>

27:27.534 --> 27:29.847
I cannot, I am outside
Jack's office.

27:29.948 --> 27:31.916
I want to surprise
him for lunch.

27:31.917 --> 27:32.904
Yeah. I have to go.

27:32.929 --> 27:34.641
I will see you
later, then.

28:31.676 --> 28:34.445
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:34.646 --> 28:36.480
How was your day?

28:36.781 --> 28:37.715
Good.

28:37.782 --> 28:39.817
Just catching up
on some work.

28:40.852 --> 28:43.052
Well, I am beat, I am
going to have a shower,

28:43.076 --> 28:45.077
and crawl into bed.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.391
How was your day?

28:47.592 --> 28:50.794
Well, we had to reboot
the servers again.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.195
Solved one problem, which
leads to another one.

28:53.219 --> 28:55.319
However, that is the
computer biz for you.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.569
- Jack?
- Yeah.

29:00.505 --> 29:02.172
Is everything
all right?

29:02.841 --> 29:04.842
Yeah, everything
is fine.

29:05.610 --> 29:07.411
Are you okay?

29:07.612 --> 29:09.613
Yeah, I am good.

29:11.382 --> 29:13.182
All right, I will
see you upstairs.

29:13.818 --> 29:15.719
<i>You do not
work too late.</i>

29:28.877 --> 29:30.277
Hey.

29:30.301 --> 29:32.501
I think I have something
on the Grigson case.

29:32.603 --> 29:34.753
Apparently our dead girl
was part of a group

29:34.805 --> 29:35.773
for ex-junkies.

29:35.874 --> 29:37.741
Narcotics No More.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.009
I am going to head
down, check it out.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.210
See what I can find.

29:40.211 --> 29:42.146
Anything on that
fingerprint?

29:42.347 --> 29:44.348
- Nothing yet.
- Let me know.

29:59.276 --> 30:00.676
NNM
NARCOTICS-NO-MORE

30:00.700 --> 30:02.500
THE BRIDGE TOWARDS
ADDICTION RECOVERY

30:17.749 --> 30:19.216
<I>Renee?</I>

30:20.351 --> 30:22.119
Do you mind if
I have a seat?

30:22.320 --> 30:23.921
Sure.

30:32.297 --> 30:34.498
I just wanted
to say.

30:34.799 --> 30:38.068
That Sage was happy to
spend some time with you.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.571
She came home,
and she was..

30:40.672 --> 30:43.006
In the greatest of
moods, she was just..

30:43.741 --> 30:45.842
She is a great kid.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.846
You did an amazing
job with her.

30:49.380 --> 30:50.781
Thanks.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.319
What about you
and Jack?

30:55.420 --> 30:57.454
You are so great
with Sage, you…

30:57.555 --> 30:59.890
Do you people ever think
about having kids?

31:03.127 --> 31:05.095
I hit a sore spot.

31:06.331 --> 31:08.932
No, we just... we are
both focused on our work.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.267
That is all.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.418
Well, maybe you should
take some time off.

31:12.442 --> 31:14.771
Get to know each
other better.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.423
Wow! When did you become
the relationship expert?

31:17.842 --> 31:19.376
Yeah, well…

31:20.545 --> 31:22.595
I guess, I learned my
lesson the hard way.

31:23.514 --> 31:25.515
It is not always
about the job.

31:26.951 --> 31:29.286
Better late than
never, I guess.

31:32.924 --> 31:35.425
I am sorry how things
ended between us.

31:38.863 --> 31:40.697
I too.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.668
Jack is a
lucky person.

31:45.536 --> 31:47.537
Always has been.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.743
Thank you.

31:54.812 --> 31:57.481
I have some work,
I have to do.

31:58.950 --> 32:00.951
Yeah, sure.

32:16.918 --> 32:19.118
NNM

32:26.577 --> 32:27.978
Hey.

35:23.054 --> 35:24.454
Honey?

35:37.268 --> 35:38.969
Hey.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.270
You are home late.

35:40.271 --> 35:42.171
I had some things to
finish up at work,

35:42.195 --> 35:43.896
and some errands
to run.

35:45.409 --> 35:46.843
How are you?

35:46.944 --> 35:48.912
Pretty good,
actually.

35:49.013 --> 35:51.815
We get a lead in the
Jessica Grigson case.

35:51.916 --> 35:53.583
Wow!

35:53.885 --> 35:56.720
Yeah, it turns out she is a
member of a support group.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.588
Narcotics No More.

35:58.589 --> 36:00.858
Did you hear of it?

36:01.459 --> 36:03.293
Narcotics No More.

36:04.697 --> 36:06.097
Yeah.

36:06.430 --> 36:09.199
Yeah, a friend of mine
used to go there.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.568
But that was a
long time ago.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.806
Listen! I am going
to watch TV.

36:16.908 --> 36:18.208
Do you want
to join me?

36:18.276 --> 36:20.110
No, I have some
work to do.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.979
Are you sure?

36:22.480 --> 36:23.914
All right!

36:24.215 --> 36:25.615
I love you.

36:52.109 --> 36:54.377
Hey, Tim.

36:54.478 --> 36:56.598
Why do not you
take a break?

36:56.623 --> 36:57.938
Are you sure?

36:58.015 --> 37:00.617
Yeah, we have been working
around the clock.

37:00.718 --> 37:03.053
It would be good to catch
up on a few things.

37:03.154 --> 37:05.254
Hey, does anything come
back from the lab?

37:05.278 --> 37:08.124
Nothing yet.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.393
There was a strange
anomaly, though.

37:10.494 --> 37:12.894
I wanted to confirm before
mentioning it to you.

37:12.918 --> 37:14.798
However, some of the
boxes mixed up.

37:14.899 --> 37:18.535
Moreover, I cannot find
case number 52899.

37:18.636 --> 37:21.238
The file and box
are both missing.

37:21.339 --> 37:23.440
Well, who pulled
the files?

37:23.541 --> 37:25.041
Ferguson.

37:25.142 --> 37:27.210
Did you want me to go
check the storage?

37:27.311 --> 37:29.980
No, no. I am fine.
Go home.

37:30.425 --> 37:31.825
Are you sure?

37:31.849 --> 37:33.950
I mean, I can stay
a bit longer.

37:34.051 --> 37:35.118
I was on my way
there anyway.

37:35.219 --> 37:36.653
Get out of here.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.154
All right!

37:56.306 --> 37:58.473
POLICE DEPARTMENT
CRIMINAL RECORDS DATABASE

37:58.567 --> 38:00.667
SEARCHING DATABASE

38:00.693 --> 38:02.093

38:02.246 --> 38:04.247
So, what do we have?

38:06.776 --> 38:08.176
BOYDEN, STEVEN

38:08.465 --> 38:10.665

38:10.721 --> 38:13.056
Steven Boyden?

38:14.558 --> 38:17.560
Drugs? Assault?

38:18.596 --> 38:19.996
My God!

38:26.753 --> 38:28.153
LOCK-UP FILE ROOM

38:31.591 --> 38:33.058

38:34.350 --> 38:36.750
FERGUSON - HOMICIDE

38:55.166 --> 38:56.566
Hello?

38:59.403 --> 39:00.803
Hello?

39:16.554 --> 39:20.590
96, 97, 98,

39:20.658 --> 39:22.058
99.

39:24.762 --> 39:27.097
Where are you, 99?

39:39.977 --> 39:41.879
Did not you
see anyone?

39:42.280 --> 39:43.830
No, I thought I
heard something.

39:43.854 --> 39:45.653
However, I did not
see anything.

39:46.091 --> 39:47.491
Do you want me
to call Jack?

39:47.515 --> 39:48.915
No, I am fine.

39:50.087 --> 39:52.455
The cold case file that
I was looking for...

39:52.656 --> 39:54.257
It is missing.

39:54.458 --> 39:56.593
What would someone
want with a cold case?

39:56.594 --> 39:58.194
I do not know.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.931
Well, that is certainly
weird, is not it?

40:01.209 --> 40:02.609
You signed
everything out.

40:02.633 --> 40:04.468
Did not you notice
it was missing?

40:04.869 --> 40:07.237
Are you accusing
me of something?

40:07.538 --> 40:10.306
I only went off your hunch
to look at the cold cases.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.109
Renee, he is right.

40:12.810 --> 40:14.644
This has to be related
to the Grigson murder.

40:14.745 --> 40:15.908
Why do not I just
take you home?

40:15.933 --> 40:17.069
You can get
some rest.

40:17.096 --> 40:18.597
What is the number
of the file?

40:18.622 --> 40:19.822
I will go
look for it.

40:19.899 --> 40:21.952
52899.

40:22.553 --> 40:24.220
What?

40:24.321 --> 40:26.322
52899.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.661
Kyle?

40:31.762 --> 40:33.763
Kyle, what is it?

40:34.565 --> 40:37.600
52899, that is...

40:37.701 --> 40:40.804
Holly's murder
case file.

40:40.905 --> 40:42.705
What?

40:42.807 --> 40:46.176
What does Holly's murder have
to do with the Grigson case?

40:46.477 --> 40:48.211
What is the number?

40:48.412 --> 40:49.812
52899.

40:55.052 --> 40:57.787
It is gone. Her file
is not in the system.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.690
- It has been wiped.
- That is impossible.

41:00.935 --> 41:02.335
You would have to have
police clearance,

41:02.359 --> 41:04.209
or be a really good
computer hacker...

41:04.233 --> 41:06.234
to get through
our firewall.

41:09.834 --> 41:11.234
Renee?

41:14.038 --> 41:16.372
Kyle, are you okay?

41:19.176 --> 41:20.576
Are you okay?

41:20.811 --> 41:22.879
Yeah, I am fine.
I am fine.

41:23.981 --> 41:26.516
I just need
a moment.

41:26.617 --> 41:28.617
You people go,
I will catch up.

41:53.911 --> 41:55.478
What?

41:55.579 --> 41:57.347
I did not work
Holly's case.

41:57.448 --> 42:00.250
However, I think I remember
the crime scene photos.

42:00.451 --> 42:02.552
<i>She was strangled.</i>

42:02.653 --> 42:04.903
<i>Nevertheless, I think
the ropes were similar.</i>

42:05.723 --> 42:07.857
That is why the file
disappeared.

42:07.958 --> 42:10.058
In addition, that has
to be the connection.

42:10.194 --> 42:12.362
Come on, I am going
to take you home.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.366
We can figure this
out in the morning.

42:16.467 --> 42:18.368
Renee, you
need to sleep.

42:38.923 --> 42:40.390
Jack?

43:07.985 --> 43:09.986
I thought I
was over it.

43:12.289 --> 43:14.057
Your wife was
murdered.

43:14.124 --> 43:16.459
That is not something
you just get over.

43:18.028 --> 43:21.397
You have to give
yourself a break!

43:21.498 --> 43:24.400
I tried counseling,
I really did.

43:24.501 --> 43:26.069
I know.

43:26.170 --> 43:29.020
I would do it every day of the
week if I thought it would…

43:29.044 --> 43:31.008
help me get over how
it all went down.

43:31.009 --> 43:33.410
However, nothing
seems to work.

43:36.246 --> 43:38.281
You have to let
someone in.

43:38.582 --> 43:39.982
I know.

43:40.284 --> 43:41.684
I know.

43:43.253 --> 43:45.521
However, we both know
it is not that easy.

43:51.128 --> 43:54.178
Do you really think there is a
connection between the murders?

43:54.202 --> 43:54.814
Holly's?

43:54.965 --> 43:57.734
I think Holly's
was the first.

43:59.003 --> 44:02.005
Then the killer got
a taste for murder.

44:02.106 --> 44:05.842
And systematically
chose his next victim.

44:05.943 --> 44:08.778
Do not you see the
similarities with the ropes…

44:08.879 --> 44:11.114
between Holly and
the Grigson case?

44:11.215 --> 44:14.517
Moreover, files do not just
magically disappear, Kyle.

44:15.586 --> 44:18.421
Someone is trying
to hide something.

44:19.690 --> 44:23.026
That beautiful, creative
mind of yours never stops.

44:25.429 --> 44:28.431
Life is not just one big
conspiracy theory, you know.

44:31.301 --> 44:34.971
I miss you.
I know I messed up.

44:36.040 --> 44:38.240
I know it is
probably too late.

44:39.710 --> 44:43.110
However, I would let you in if you
could give me another chance.

44:45.916 --> 44:47.316
<i>Hi, honey?</i>

44:49.386 --> 44:50.787
I am in here.

44:58.262 --> 45:00.096
Jack, how are
you, buddy?

45:00.197 --> 45:01.597
Kyle.

45:01.665 --> 45:04.500
I was just leaving. Thanks
for the talk, Renee.

45:08.839 --> 45:10.439
I will see you
around, Jack.

45:25.989 --> 45:27.402
Are you working
late again?

45:27.427 --> 45:29.182
What is he
doing here?

45:30.594 --> 45:32.362
We need to talk.

45:35.866 --> 45:38.768
Renee, is something going
on between you and Kyle?

45:40.237 --> 45:43.106
We were talking
about a case.

45:43.207 --> 45:45.575
I am sorry; It just
seems a little odd.

45:45.676 --> 45:49.746
You are in our house
alone with him.

45:51.415 --> 45:53.416
One, he is a
colleague.

45:53.517 --> 45:55.952
In addition, two, you do not
tell me who I can be friend.

45:56.053 --> 45:57.453
I am not trying
to tell you.

45:57.488 --> 45:59.688
Who or who you cannot
be friend with, Renee.

45:59.712 --> 46:02.714
However, I know him very well
or have you forgotten that?

46:06.163 --> 46:07.830
I am sorry.

46:13.871 --> 46:17.173
I am jealous.
All right.

46:18.175 --> 46:19.742
Satisfied?

46:23.614 --> 46:25.048
What?

46:25.249 --> 46:27.583
Steven Boyden.

46:35.092 --> 46:36.492
Renee!

46:37.928 --> 46:41.130
Look! I wanted to tell
you about my past.

46:41.331 --> 46:42.899
I did.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.469
However, I was afraid if I…
if I did, I would lose you.

46:47.070 --> 46:49.071
Moreover, I could
not do that.

46:50.073 --> 46:52.675
Therefore, I kept
it a secret.

46:52.776 --> 46:55.111
I kept it a secret
from everyone.

46:57.981 --> 47:02.418
I have worked hard to put
Steven Boyden behind me.

47:02.519 --> 47:05.855
I did some time, and I
paid for what I did.

47:08.091 --> 47:10.193
I am not the same
person, Renee.

47:13.163 --> 47:15.097
You have to
believe that.

47:16.133 --> 47:19.235
Why do you still go
to Narcotics No More?

47:21.338 --> 47:23.673
Have you been
following me?

47:23.774 --> 47:25.875
I am a cop, Jack.

47:28.879 --> 47:30.913
In addition, who is
that blonde woman?

47:33.550 --> 47:35.050
What do you
mean, Bess?

47:36.687 --> 47:38.354
Honey!

47:40.791 --> 47:43.960
Baby… I am
her sponsor.

47:44.895 --> 47:47.296
- A sponsor?
- Yeah.

47:47.397 --> 47:50.333
Part of the program is about
getting second chances.

47:50.434 --> 47:52.334
Moreover, I believe
in second chances.

47:52.458 --> 47:56.639
That is why I did not tell
you about Steve Boyden.

47:56.640 --> 47:58.590
Sometimes you do not
get second chances.

47:58.664 --> 48:00.665
I could not
risk losing you.

48:03.714 --> 48:06.482
I am so
sorry, Renee.

48:11.989 --> 48:13.990
Please forgive me.

48:21.231 --> 48:23.232
I forgive you.

48:42.052 --> 48:43.452
What is going on?

48:43.520 --> 48:46.470
Holly's file that went missing
triggered a security breach.

48:46.494 --> 48:49.442
Now they got us on lockdown
until we can find it.

48:49.493 --> 48:51.993
- Have they been to the lab?
- They are everywhere.

48:52.017 --> 48:54.213
Locker us, Morgan
call Jade.

48:54.264 --> 48:56.098
Let us re-work some
of the Grigson leads.

48:56.099 --> 48:58.149
I have been trying her
since this morning.

48:58.173 --> 49:00.074
It goes straight
to the voice mail.

49:00.370 --> 49:01.770
See?

49:03.006 --> 49:05.975
You cannot do this.
I have active files.

49:06.276 --> 49:08.744
Is there a problem,
and who are you?

49:08.745 --> 49:10.179
I am Renee Murphy.

49:10.480 --> 49:12.515
- Who are you?
- Abbey Coleman.

49:12.616 --> 49:14.083
Your new problem.

49:14.384 --> 49:16.452
I need that computer
to do my work.

49:16.753 --> 49:17.820
I am sure there
is something.

49:17.921 --> 49:20.523
You can occupy
your time, Murphy.

49:21.325 --> 49:22.725
I have personal
files.

49:22.926 --> 49:24.326
Well, you
should not.

49:24.394 --> 49:26.863
Do you know how many
hours I log in here?

49:27.164 --> 49:29.614
There has been a breach, if
you have not already heard.

49:29.615 --> 49:30.749
I will need you
to step aside.

49:30.850 --> 49:32.669
Until this
investigation is done.

49:33.270 --> 49:35.271
In addition, how
long will that take?

49:35.472 --> 49:36.939
As long as
it takes.

49:39.009 --> 49:41.077
Excuse me. Renee?

49:41.478 --> 49:43.378
Looks like we have a
fresh crime scene.

49:43.402 --> 49:44.747
I will meet
you there.

49:44.772 --> 49:46.172
Okay.

49:47.050 --> 49:50.150
Attend to your duties, Murphy,
moreover, I will attend to mine.

49:50.174 --> 49:51.842
Stay out of my way.

49:55.302 --> 49:58.402
STREET CLOSED

49:58.566 --> 50:02.366
CRIME SCENE
DO NOT CROSS

50:05.669 --> 50:07.104
Kyle?

50:08.005 --> 50:09.972
What is going on?

50:09.973 --> 50:12.308
It is Jade.

50:32.929 --> 50:34.563
That is three
dead girls…

50:34.664 --> 50:37.566
all with the exact
same rope pattern.

50:37.667 --> 50:39.869
This is a
serial killer.

50:42.706 --> 50:45.908
Kyle, does Jade
remind you of Holly?

50:46.009 --> 50:47.843
Same age,
same hair.

50:47.944 --> 50:50.846
I mean, there are
some similarities.

50:50.947 --> 50:52.947
Yeah, maybe she reminded
him of someone.

50:52.971 --> 50:55.534
An ex-lover,
family member.

50:55.585 --> 50:57.053
Serial killers tend
to go after types.

50:57.154 --> 50:59.488
Are you suggesting this has
something to do with Holly?

50:59.589 --> 51:01.991
Can you think of anyone, like
someone who was bothering her?

51:02.092 --> 51:03.592
She was a cop. There
was always someone.

51:03.616 --> 51:05.166
I mean, she
had an edge.

51:05.395 --> 51:07.395
I think you are
overthinking this, Renee.

51:07.419 --> 51:08.297
That is my job.

51:08.298 --> 51:10.898
What about the fact that
nobody knew Jessica Grigson?

51:11.068 --> 51:11.967
If your theory
is correct.

51:11.969 --> 51:12.868
There are many
other victims,

51:12.870 --> 51:14.604
between her
and Holly.

51:15.005 --> 51:16.806
Maybe Jade got on his
radar through the case.

51:16.907 --> 51:18.957
<I>- This area is blocked off.
- Hey, hey...</I>

51:18.981 --> 51:20.649
Maybe he is
watching us.

51:22.557 --> 51:23.957
- Hey, Tim, take it easy.
- Jade.

51:24.181 --> 51:25.514
- Come on. Take it easy.
- What happened?

51:25.615 --> 51:26.816
Take it easy.
Come on.

51:26.817 --> 51:28.767
<i>Let us go.
Come with me.</i>

51:28.891 --> 51:30.692
<i>What happened
with Jade?</i>

51:48.872 --> 51:50.272
I got you.

51:56.813 --> 51:59.615
Special Agent Coleman
wants to see you.

52:00.017 --> 52:02.267
Okay, I am just going to
take this to the lab.

52:02.291 --> 52:03.741
No. She wants
to see you, now!

52:03.968 --> 52:05.368
Morgan, what
is going on?

52:05.392 --> 52:06.792
I cannot say.

52:07.134 --> 52:08.534
<I>- Renee?</I>
- Jack?

52:08.558 --> 52:09.725
It is okay, honey.
It is okay.

52:09.826 --> 52:10.860
Call my lawyer.

52:11.149 --> 52:12.149
- I did not do this!
- Come on.

52:12.162 --> 52:14.197
I did not do this!
I love you!

52:14.631 --> 52:16.031
Morgan, what
is going on?

52:16.033 --> 52:18.134
You know that, I
cannot say anything.

52:18.335 --> 52:20.035
Just do me a favor, and do
not incriminate yourself.

52:20.059 --> 52:21.822
Your husband has
done that for you.

52:22.650 --> 52:24.050
What?

52:24.074 --> 52:25.674
Just answer the
questions, Renee,

52:25.698 --> 52:27.118
and you will
be fine.

52:27.344 --> 52:29.994
You have not done anything
wrong, right. Let us go.

52:36.219 --> 52:37.720
Have a seat.

52:47.731 --> 52:49.899
We found evidence
on your computer.

52:50.100 --> 52:51.701
What evidence?

52:51.946 --> 52:53.946
The partial prints
from the Grigson case…

52:53.970 --> 52:55.004
came back
from the lab.

52:55.105 --> 52:57.105
It is a match to the
print that you hid…

52:57.129 --> 52:59.325
in your personal
folder.

52:59.376 --> 53:02.144
They both connect
to a Steven Boyden.

53:02.245 --> 53:04.713
That is your husband
Jack Alias, is not it?

53:06.260 --> 53:07.710
There has to be
some mistake.

53:07.734 --> 53:10.184
How long have you known
your husband is a killer?

53:11.788 --> 53:13.355
He is not a killer.

53:13.357 --> 53:16.692
However, you found out
his real name, his past.

53:19.029 --> 53:21.397
What did he say, when
you confronted him?

53:22.099 --> 53:23.899
He did not deny it.

53:24.100 --> 53:26.350
Moreover, since, when
is a man proven guilty?

53:26.374 --> 53:28.337
Without any
real evidence.

53:28.738 --> 53:30.138
He has a rap sheet…

53:30.207 --> 53:32.875
that I would say is a
precursor to murder.

53:33.810 --> 53:35.578
I need your help
here, Renee.

53:35.679 --> 53:38.614
I do not want you to lose
your job, and your husband.

53:41.084 --> 53:43.085
Something made you
suspect him enough…

53:43.186 --> 53:45.187
to run his prints
through the system.

53:47.224 --> 53:49.792
Are you charging
me with something?

53:49.893 --> 53:51.460
Do I need a lawyer?

53:52.540 --> 53:53.940
Look.

53:53.964 --> 53:55.898
If you cooperate
with us.

53:55.999 --> 53:58.267
Things may go easier
on you in the future.

53:58.268 --> 54:00.169
Are you
threatening me?

54:00.170 --> 54:01.771
That would
not be wise.

54:02.072 --> 54:04.507
That partial print will
not hold up in court.

54:04.508 --> 54:07.209
Moreover, the print I took
was not a legal search.

54:07.210 --> 54:09.178
Nevertheless, you
already know that.

54:09.179 --> 54:12.481
Therefore, unless you have
something real, we are done.

54:15.452 --> 54:16.986
I would have
a seat.

54:19.356 --> 54:20.756
You have nothing.

54:20.824 --> 54:24.860
I have enough temporarily to
remove you, from your duties.

54:26.630 --> 54:28.097
Fine.

54:44.914 --> 54:46.949
- Renee.
- I...

54:47.550 --> 54:50.386
I am sending the CSI
team to your house.

54:50.387 --> 54:52.637
We are waiting for a
warrant. Take these keys.

54:52.822 --> 54:55.624
Take the keys.
Go to my house.

54:55.725 --> 54:58.727
You do not talk to anyone except
to your lawyer, you got it?

55:34.130 --> 55:36.131
All right, people,
head on in.

55:43.201 --> 55:44.601
<i>Let us go then.</i>

55:46.710 --> 55:48.511
- Hey.
- Hi.

55:51.881 --> 55:54.550
Can I sit in on
the meeting?

55:54.651 --> 55:57.419
Sure. I am Bess.

56:00.023 --> 56:01.590
Renee.

56:03.093 --> 56:05.861
Attending a meeting is the
first step in recovery.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.097
Everyone is here
to support you.

56:08.398 --> 56:11.901
I have a friend who gone
in here, Jack Murphy.

56:12.202 --> 56:14.970
Yeah, I know Jack. He
is a great person.

56:16.172 --> 56:17.573
How long have
you know him?

56:18.908 --> 56:20.443
He is my sponsor.

56:21.344 --> 56:23.613
Without him, I would
be back on street.

56:24.614 --> 56:26.014
He helped many
people here.

56:28.651 --> 56:30.101
The meeting is
about to start.

56:30.553 --> 56:31.953
Come on in.

56:44.300 --> 56:47.737
<i>Hey, everyone welcome
to this week meeting.</i>

56:48.038 --> 56:51.540
I just want to remind everyone
this is a safe place.

56:51.641 --> 56:54.110
A place for healing,
and for sharing,

56:54.311 --> 56:56.145
<i>so let us be
welcome and warm…</i>

56:56.246 --> 56:58.447
<i>to those who need
to share tonight.</i>

57:01.418 --> 57:03.519
Daddy should be
home any minute.

57:04.020 --> 57:06.655
I never knew you were, so
I handy in the kitchen.

57:06.856 --> 57:08.725
Well, it is either
that or starves.

57:10.126 --> 57:11.526
Hey, Daddy, how
was your day?

57:11.561 --> 57:13.729
It was great, sweetheart,
how was yours?

57:13.730 --> 57:16.131
It was good. Dinner
is not quite ready.

57:16.133 --> 57:18.483
Therefore, I am going to
do a bit more homework.

57:18.507 --> 57:20.408
- All right, kiddo.
- Okay.

57:23.673 --> 57:25.073
How are you?

57:25.942 --> 57:28.192
I am waiting to hear
back from Jack's lawyer.

57:28.216 --> 57:30.550
He could be out, as
early as tomorrow.

57:31.681 --> 57:33.715
Kyle, I am not going
to give up on him.

57:33.817 --> 57:35.451
You know, I cannot talk
about the details…

57:35.552 --> 57:37.102
of this investigation
with you.

57:37.126 --> 57:39.538
I know, I know. So
please, just listen.

57:39.589 --> 57:40.989
Renee.

57:42.659 --> 57:44.527
I saw him with
another woman.

57:44.928 --> 57:48.096
I was angry and jealous,
I jumped to conclusions.

57:48.198 --> 57:50.066
Nevertheless,
I was wrong.

57:50.733 --> 57:53.836
He is a sponsor in a
drug recovery program.

57:53.937 --> 57:55.437
I just came
from there.

57:55.738 --> 57:58.141
She did not know
that I was his wife.

57:58.942 --> 58:00.342
He is not lying.

58:00.610 --> 58:02.845
In addition, he never
mentioned this before.

58:03.546 --> 58:05.514
I mean, it is as if he has
hidden his entire life from you.

58:05.515 --> 58:08.651
Because he was scared, that his
past would affect our future.

58:08.952 --> 58:10.752
That I would not
understand.

58:10.854 --> 58:12.754
Do not people deserve
a second chance?

58:12.789 --> 58:14.523
Yes, I get that.

58:18.138 --> 58:20.138
In addition, a second
chance is what I...

58:20.162 --> 58:21.000
Kyle, please.

58:21.097 --> 58:23.332
Is a fingerprint
all they have?

58:25.196 --> 58:26.596
Yes.

58:30.473 --> 58:32.523
Therefore, somebody
could have planted it.

58:33.643 --> 58:35.044
We do not know
that for sure.

58:37.480 --> 58:38.948
<i>I got something.</i>

58:39.349 --> 58:41.683
<i>- What is that?
- It is a carabiner.</i>

58:41.784 --> 58:44.084
<i>Climbers use them to keep
tension on the ropes.</i>

58:46.089 --> 58:47.589
<i>You ran his print.</i>

58:47.590 --> 58:50.290
<i>I do not think you are as
sure about this as you think.</i>

58:54.957 --> 58:56.357
I need to go home.

58:56.381 --> 58:57.590
I think you
should stay.

58:57.767 --> 58:59.369
I really
have to go.

59:00.470 --> 59:03.572
Okay. Your place is
probably clear by now.

59:06.809 --> 59:09.559
<i>You reached the law offices
of Steinke and Young.</i>

59:09.583 --> 59:12.818
<i>Please leave a detailed message,
and we will return your call.</i>

59:14.517 --> 59:16.652
Hi, this is
Renee Murphy.

59:16.753 --> 59:21.223
I am calling to get an update
on my husband, Jack Murphy.

59:21.324 --> 59:23.892
Please call me back
as soon as possible.

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:21.416
Jack, are you
all right?

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:23.385
<i>Yeah, I just
was released.</i>

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:24.011
Really?

01:00:24.036 --> 01:00:25.436
<i>Yeah, I will
explain later.</i>

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:28.190
- I am on my way.
<i>- All right, thanks.</i>

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:29.725
<i>- Hey, honey?</i>
- Yeah?

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:31.226
<i>I love you.</i>

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:35.130
I love you, too.
See you soon.

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.372
Hi.

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:52.080
What happened?

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:55.131
The DA decided there was not
enough evidence to go a jury.

01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:58.224
- It is over.
- I am a free man.

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:03.591
Take this free man home,
he needs a shower.

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:17.806
- What happened?
- I do not know.

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:20.542
The investigators asked
me for a list of names…

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:24.379
the persons I climb with,
and I do not know.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.516
I guess someone stole
some of my equipment.

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:31.486
Moreover, they are thinking
somebody is trying to frame me.

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:34.055
I am just glad
it is over.

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:37.610
YOU HAVE 1 MESSAGE

01:01:37.634 --> 01:01:39.334
Hey, where are you?

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:49.304
Jack?

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:51.172
What is it?

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:53.709
I have something,
I have to tell you.

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:57.680
When I saw you
with Bess.

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:00.483
I ran your
fingerprints.

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:04.184
That is how they had them
to match with the evidence.

01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:05.642
This is my fault.

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:12.393
You are a Cop.

01:02:13.363 --> 01:02:15.364
I get it.

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:17.132
You are just
doing your job.

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:20.169
Baby, I am so sorry.

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.538
Let it go.

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:25.874
All right?

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:28.176
It is over.

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.311
Come here.

01:02:34.283 --> 01:02:36.983
I think somebody is really
trying to get a hold of you.

01:02:37.279 --> 01:02:40.115
Well, they are just
going to have to wait.

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:01.443
Coleman wants
to see you.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.080
Hey.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:10.552
Therefore, listen, I
am sorry about before.

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:12.721
I was following
orders.

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:14.989
Okay.

01:03:18.761 --> 01:03:20.161
Have a seat.

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.348
Are you leaving
so soon?

01:03:22.473 --> 01:03:23.890
My job here
is done.

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:26.134
All the access codes
were changed.

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:28.137
Sign this for
clearance, please.

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:33.342
No hard feelings?

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:36.411
You were just
doing your job.

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:38.314
Moreover, you were
just doing yours.

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:42.117
Am I backing on the
Grigson case, and Jade's?

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:44.753
The perp is still out
there, so lots to do.

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:46.955
Thank you.

01:03:48.458 --> 01:03:49.958
Thank you.

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:52.695
I am glad I was wrong
about your husband.

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:54.996
I too.

01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:03.540
New sign in
procedure.

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:08.477
You have to initial
here, here, and here.

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:13.414
Are you okay?

01:04:15.607 --> 01:04:17.007
Yeah. Getting there.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.020
You?

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:20.989
Better.

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:24.426
We have a lot
of work to do.

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:26.227
That lockdown cost
us valuable time.

01:04:26.594 --> 01:04:29.123
Yeah. Any evidence access
is logged manually…

01:04:29.137 --> 01:04:30.037
on the computer.

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:31.633
Great! I am going
to need you…

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.684
to get me back up to
speed on the cases.

01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:35.108
Done.

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:38.207
In addition, it is… it is
nice to have you back.

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:40.142
It is nice
to be back.

01:05:28.871 --> 01:05:33.140
Expedite this to the
lab, label it is urgent.

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:34.930
I will run it
over right now.

LOVE JADE

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:09.164
<I>- Jack?</I>
- Hey.

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:11.365
Where are you? It is the
middle of the night.

01:06:11.389 --> 01:06:14.152
Yeah, I am sorry, I am sorry.
I am still at the station.

01:06:14.503 --> 01:06:17.453
You said you were going to stop
these late nights, remember?

01:06:17.477 --> 01:06:19.545
I think we had a
break-through.

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:21.609
Whait! Did you
find the killer?

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:23.246
<i>We have a
possible lead.</i>

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:25.847
That is great.

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:28.215
I knew you would find
the right person.

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:30.184
<i>Now, can you please
come home, honey?</i>

01:06:30.208 --> 01:06:32.509
Okay. I will
see you soon.

ANALYTICAL RESULTS: ONE
MATCHING PROFILE WAS FOUND

01:06:51.178 --> 01:06:52.578
Shit!

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:59.480
Hey. I need you to
come down here.

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:02.116
Right now.

01:07:06.923 --> 01:07:08.323
What is up?

01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:12.627
We got a hit off the hair
from Jade's crime scene.

01:07:12.928 --> 01:07:14.778
I thought that was
going to take days.

01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:17.065
It would if it
was an unknown.

01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:20.001
However, not if it is
already in our database.

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:21.870
I do not like where
this is going.

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:25.773
Who is it?

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:28.042
It is Tim.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.278
Tim?

01:07:33.482 --> 01:07:35.382
Does this could not
wait until morning?

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:38.320
Renee got a hit off the
hair at Jade's crime scene.

01:07:38.356 --> 01:07:39.756
What would
you bring up?

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:40.679
It is Tim.

01:07:40.856 --> 01:07:41.990
No, no, no, no, no,
It has to be…

01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:43.691
a cross-contamination
at the crime scene.

01:07:43.715 --> 01:07:44.926
I worked the body.

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:46.894
I came in first,
he came in after me.

01:07:46.918 --> 01:07:48.196
He did not go
near Jade.

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:50.399
He was too upset to
work the crime scene.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.000
She is right.

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:54.670
She was the only one who
went anywhere near Jade.

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:57.973
It could also explain
the computer hacking.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.925
All right, I will get a search
warrant to search his home.

01:08:01.949 --> 01:08:03.350
Morgan brings
him in.

01:08:19.477 --> 01:08:20.877
How is it coming?

01:08:20.901 --> 01:08:22.399
He is asking
for you.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.200
I cannot get
anything out of him.

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.002
Maybe he will
talk to you.

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:44.886
<i>How are you doing?</i>

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:50.425
Renee, they… they
got it all wrong.

01:08:51.426 --> 01:08:53.127
I would never
hurt Jade.

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:00.033
Nevertheless,
you did...

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:03.604
Have a personal relationship
with her, did not you?

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:07.642
I loved Jade.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.880
We had a thing
for a while.

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:15.450
We did not
tell anyone,

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:17.586
but I wanted to
make it official.

01:09:19.921 --> 01:09:21.923
How about Jade?

01:09:22.124 --> 01:09:23.625
How did she feel
about that?

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:26.694
Not the same as me.

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:32.167
I think there was
someone else.

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.318
She started
acting all funny.

01:09:34.353 --> 01:09:36.453
She said she had a
friend she had to meet.

01:09:36.716 --> 01:09:39.102
I could tell it was
another person.

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:44.545
Did she say
who he was?

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.279
No.

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:52.386
That must have
made you so upset.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.593
I would never
hurt her.

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:02.063
I loved her.

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:05.567
God, I swear,
I swear, Renee.

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:08.604
I could not do that to
anyone, especially her.

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:11.439
You have to help
me here.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.709
Now give me some more
personal details about Jade.

01:10:16.445 --> 01:10:19.347
She was... she was
very private.

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:23.833
However, I could tell she had
some problems from the past.

01:10:23.857 --> 01:10:25.858
How? Like what?

01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:31.226
She went through a
lot of therapy.

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:33.895
Psychiatrists?
Psychologist? Counsellor?

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:36.031
No. No.

01:10:36.309 --> 01:10:37.709
Not AA,
something else,

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:40.969
Some, some
organization.

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:42.738
Help me here.

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:49.310
She is an
ex-drug addict.

01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:02.023
Wait! You believe
me, do not you?

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:04.392
Renee?

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:44.365

<i>Jade, are you looking
for something?</i>

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:40.021
<I>I just needed
my phone.</I>

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:42.924

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.042
<i>Renee?</i> Tim is out on bail,
and I cannot find Kyle.

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:44.278
Do you know
where he is?

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.747
<I>No, I have no
idea where he is.</I>

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:49.299
Could you call him? Maybe
he will pick up for you.

01:14:49.896 --> 01:14:51.296
Sure.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.720
<I>Where are you?</I>

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:56.991
I am at home.

01:14:57.223 --> 01:15:00.092
I just, stopped by to
change my clothes.

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:01.962
I will see
you shortly.

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:04.332
Okay, let me know if
you get him, please.

01:15:56.385 --> 01:16:01.622
Red, orange,
yellow, green.

01:16:03.826 --> 01:16:05.326
No blue.

01:16:33.471 --> 01:16:35.271
<I>Kyle, I need
your help.</I>

01:16:35.334 --> 01:16:37.301
<I>I konw who the
killer is.</I>

01:16:37.337 --> 01:16:40.004
<I>Meet me at my

01:17:00.810 --> 01:17:03.877

talk to you.</i>

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:06.486
<i>Please, call
me ASAP.</i>

01:17:10.737 --> 01:17:12.137
YOU HAVE 1

01:17:12.161 --> 01:17:13.911
<i>Renee, if you want
to see jack again</i>

01:17:13.935 --> 01:17:17.068
<i>meet me at
Devil's Punch Bowl.</i>

01:17:34.394 --> 01:17:35.794
Hey.

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:37.985
Hey, I just got a
text from Tim.

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:39.587
He has Jack.

01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:42.723
What? Tim has Jack.
I do not understand.

01:17:42.787 --> 01:17:46.023
<i>He is at Devil's Punch
Bowl, right now.</i>

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:47.895
You are cutting out,
Renee. I cannot.

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:49.797
Devil's Punch Bowl.

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:49.857
<i>Renee?</i>

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:52.894
Just stop
right there!

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:55.863
- What?
- It is over, Jack.

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:56.989
I know what
you did.

01:18:57.014 --> 01:18:58.414
You need to turn
yourself in.

01:18:58.516 --> 01:18:59.816
What are you
talking about?

01:18:59.917 --> 01:19:01.082
Tim is the one who
kidnapped me.

01:19:01.107 --> 01:19:02.507
He is the killer.

01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:05.406
I found the
storage locker.

01:19:06.919 --> 01:19:08.469
The police are
there, right now.

01:19:08.493 --> 01:19:11.393
Kyle and Morgan are
on their way here.

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:17.919
You know, when you are
laying you get this...

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.889
Dimple on the side
of your cheek.

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:23.190
Right here.

01:19:24.559 --> 01:19:25.959
Did you know that?

01:19:28.841 --> 01:19:30.241
Nobody is
coming, Renee.

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:32.500
You stay right there,
I am warning you.

01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:34.101
Alternatively, what?

01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:36.905
Are you going to
fingerprint me?

01:19:38.507 --> 01:19:40.508
All those women.

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:43.811
Holly, Jennifer,
Jade.

01:19:43.912 --> 01:19:45.312
You.

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.449
Why, Jack?

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:50.952
Why not? I think is the
appropriate question.

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:54.255
Jade helped you
to frame Tim.

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:55.956
Did not she?

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:59.575
However, she did not know
that you would turn on her.

01:20:00.681 --> 01:20:02.081
Why, Jack?

01:20:02.105 --> 01:20:04.155
Because it is
a game, Renee.

01:20:04.332 --> 01:20:06.333
You should
know that.

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:09.637
Holly was the
hardest but…

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:17.211
Jade was
somewhat funny.

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:22.598
Therefore, you were just
biding your time with me.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.220
No.

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:29.156
No, no, honey, you were
different from the others.

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.059
Well, you...

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:37.064
You showed me respect
and comfort.

01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:42.903
I thought that I could
grow to love it.

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.975
I thought I could
grow to love you.

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:53.247
That is because you are
incapable to love.

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:58.619
Sociopaths relate
to obsession.

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:02.957
You will never
find love.

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:04.658
<i>Renee?</i>

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:07.493
Then I guess you will just
going to have to meet others.

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:17.771
<i>Renee?</i>

01:21:21.743 --> 01:21:23.410
<i>Renee?</i>

01:21:28.116 --> 01:21:29.650
It was Jack.

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:31.919
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

01:21:54.383 --> 01:21:58.183
FOUR WEEKS LATER

01:21:58.380 --> 01:21:59.606
<i>We have always
been close.</i>

01:21:59.731 --> 01:22:00.680
<i>I do not know
about that.</i>

01:22:00.711 --> 01:22:01.769
But we make
a good team.

01:22:01.787 --> 01:22:03.187
Yeah.

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:09.723
Well, well. All hail to
the new head of CSI.

01:22:09.766 --> 01:22:11.034
Thank you.

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:15.263
It is going to be hard losing
one of the department's best.

01:22:15.464 --> 01:22:17.415
However, I guess when
the big guns call.

01:22:17.439 --> 01:22:19.262
We have to go.
We have to go.

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:21.368
Congratulations.

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:23.971
Renee, you deserve
every bit of this.

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:25.372
Thank you.

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:27.007
How are you doing?

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:30.345
I am getting there.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.607
Well, you
look great.

01:22:33.632 --> 01:22:34.672
Thank you.

01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:36.750
You need a drink,
is what you need.

01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:45.225
Well, I always knew you would
make head of CSI someday.

01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:50.119
I just want to
say I am sorry,

01:22:50.123 --> 01:22:51.523
if I was ever
hard on you.

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:54.802
That is okay.
I get it.

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:58.272
Moreover, hey,
listen, I mean…

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:01.242
Now that we are officially
not working together,

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:03.844
not even in the
same precinct.

01:23:05.047 --> 01:23:07.014
Maybe we could…

01:23:07.616 --> 01:23:09.750
take a walk

I would like that.

my God!

01:23:29.195 --> 01:23:30.195
Yeah.

01:23:30.438 --> 01:23:31.939

Such a nice day
for a walk.

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:38.112

the invite.

01:23:38.213 --> 01:23:40.280
