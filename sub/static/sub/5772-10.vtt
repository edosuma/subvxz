DATING A MANLY GUY
LIKE DANNY CASTELLANO

00:03.571 --> 00:05.173
HAS ITS ADVANTAGES.

00:05.206 --> 00:07.241
HE CAN COOK A PERFECT STEAK
IN TEN MINUTES.

00:07.275 --> 00:08.542
THE SECRET
TO A GREAT STEAK IS,

00:08.576 --> 00:10.711
YOU GOT TO MASSAGE
THE MEAT FOR AN HOUR.

00:10.744 --> 00:14.082
VITO--MY BUTCHER VITO,
NOT MY BARBER VITO--

00:14.115 --> 00:16.717
HE SAID, "DANNY,
YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE

00:16.750 --> 00:19.687
IT'S A VERY SENSUAL MASSAGE."

00:19.720 --> 00:21.089
DEAR GOD.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.391
YOU WANT ANOTHER?

00:24.725 --> 00:26.260
OH, THAT'S HOT.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.629
MMM.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.298
(Mindy)
AND HE'S SO HANDY,

00:30.331 --> 00:32.233
HE CAN BUILD ANYTHING.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.267
DONE.

00:33.301 --> 00:35.336
WHY DO YOU NEED ANOTHER ROW
OF DRESSES IN THERE?

00:35.369 --> 00:38.339
OH, THIS ONE IS
FOR MY ASPIRATIONAL SIZES.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.175
MINDY, THIS IS
A DOLL'S DRESS.

00:41.209 --> 00:41.975
OH, YEAH?
YEAH.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.311
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
YOU CAN DRILL?

00:43.344 --> 00:44.312
WHAT?

00:44.345 --> 00:45.313
[drill whirs]

00:45.346 --> 00:46.514
OH!
OH, GOD!

00:46.547 --> 00:48.482
(Mindy)
BUT AS GREAT AS A MANLY GUY IS,

00:48.516 --> 00:50.518
SOMETIMES YOU NEED
A PINCH HITTER--

00:50.551 --> 00:52.353
A PAL YOU TAKE
TO THE RIHANNA BOOK SIGNING

00:52.386 --> 00:55.356
WHEN YOUR BOYFRIEND CALLS IT
"THE REASON CHINA IS WINNING."

00:55.389 --> 00:57.725
YOU MIND WAITING OUTSIDE
WHILE I CHANGE?

00:57.758 --> 00:59.293
WHAT? NO.
I'M COMING IN.

00:59.327 --> 01:00.428
I'VE NEVER BEEN HERE,
AND I WANT TO JUDGE YOUR TASTE.

01:00.461 --> 01:01.495
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SEE MY APARTMENT.

01:01.529 --> 01:02.463
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

01:02.496 --> 01:03.464
TAKE IT EASY!
I--

01:03.497 --> 01:04.465
I'M COMING IN!
[glass shatters]

01:04.498 --> 01:05.633
OH!
[rock music playing]

01:05.666 --> 01:06.667
YOU'RE UP, BLACK MAN!

01:06.700 --> 01:08.236
5,000 BUCKS I HIT THIS.

01:08.269 --> 01:11.372
[glass shatters,
all cheering]

01:11.405 --> 01:13.874
OH, MY GOD.
SO THIS IS HOW I DIE.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.210
RELAX.
THESE ARE MY ROOMMATES.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.711
BOYS, THIS IS MINDY.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.148
MINDY, THIS IS PUBE,
PUBELESS...

01:20.181 --> 01:21.282
AND BUSH.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.417
BUSH IS A KENNEDY.

01:24.618 --> 01:25.753
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA CHANGE.

01:25.786 --> 01:26.754
WHAT?
YOU'RE LEAVING ME HERE?

01:26.787 --> 01:27.755
NO, PETER!
PETER!

01:27.788 --> 01:28.756
GUYS, BE NICE TO HER.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.458
SHE GETS FREAKED OUT
EASILY.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.793
SO...
YOU'RE A GIRL.

01:32.826 --> 01:33.827
THAT'S TIGHT.

01:33.861 --> 01:34.862
I AM.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.364
I AM A LITIGIOUS,
GUN-OWNING WOMAN.

01:36.397 --> 01:37.865
[laughs]

01:37.898 --> 01:38.866
[dog barking]
[gasps]

01:38.899 --> 01:40.368
WHAT'D YOU DO
TO NICOLE?

01:40.401 --> 01:42.570
OH, WE SPRAY-PAINTED HER
FOR DARTMOUTH HOMECOMING,

01:42.603 --> 01:43.904
BUT AT THIS POINT,
WE'RE JUST LEAVING IT

01:43.937 --> 01:45.373
FOR ST. PATRICK'S DAY.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.374
WE WERE SO DRUNK
THAT DAY.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.375
[laughter]

01:47.408 --> 01:48.376
YEAH.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.443
BUSH EVEN MADE OUT
WITH HIS SISTER.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.279
HALF SISTER, DUDE.
MM-HMM.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.214
IT'S COMPLICATED.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.315
OH!
[chuckles]

01:54.348 --> 01:55.783
[gasps]

01:55.816 --> 01:57.285
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

01:57.318 --> 01:58.286
DUDE, COME ON.
THROW THAT ONE BACK.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.520
IT'S TOO SMALL.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.322
IT'S ENORMOUS,
BUT IT'S MINE, YOU PERV.

02:01.355 --> 02:03.757
PETER, WHY DO YOU
LIVE HERE?

02:03.791 --> 02:05.559
'CAUSE A ROOM OPENED UP
WHEN SCROTE'S DAD DIED,

02:05.593 --> 02:07.261
AND HE BECAME
KING OF KUWAIT.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.762
OH!

02:08.796 --> 02:10.764
[gasps]

02:10.798 --> 02:13.801
[hip-hop music]

02:15.336 --> 02:16.804
(Danny)
HEY, MIN, WHAT DO YOU THINK

02:16.837 --> 02:19.240
ABOUT THIS LISTING
FOR MY EXTRA APARTMENT?

02:19.273 --> 02:20.708
"IMMACULATE
PET-HATER'S DREAM.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.243
"A PERFECT PLACE
TO TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF

02:22.276 --> 02:23.877
AND NOT SMOKE."

02:23.911 --> 02:24.878
HMM.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.314
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

02:26.347 --> 02:27.781
I AM GOING TO GO DO ROUNDS
WITH MY INTERNS,

02:27.815 --> 02:30.318
AND THEN AFTERWARDS,
I'M GETTING BRUNCH WITH PETER.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.452
YOU KNOW WHAT,
THOUGH?

02:31.485 --> 02:32.786
YOU SHOULD COME TO BRUNCH
WITH US.

02:32.820 --> 02:33.654
YOU'LL HAVE SO MUCH FUN,

02:33.687 --> 02:35.223
AND YOU NEVER HANG OUT
WITH FRIENDS.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.390
I DON'T NEED FRIENDS,
OKAY?

02:36.424 --> 02:37.525
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

02:37.558 --> 02:38.826
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
OF A RELATIONSHIP--

02:38.859 --> 02:40.261
SO I ALWAYS HAVE
MY LITTLE BUDDY

02:40.294 --> 02:42.263
TO WATCH THE WEATHER CHANNEL
WITH ME.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.565
AND I LOVE TRACKING
POLLEN COUNTS WITH YOU--

02:44.598 --> 02:46.734
YEAH, LAST WEEK,
VERMONT--

02:46.767 --> 02:49.637
MORE LIKE SNEEZINGTON,
RIGHT?

02:49.670 --> 02:50.638
SHOULD WE TURN IT ON?

02:50.671 --> 02:51.939
NO, NO, NO,
PLEASE DON'T.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.307
SO WANT TO COME
TO BRUNCH?

02:53.341 --> 02:54.141
OH, I CAN'T ANYWAY.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.943
MY CONTRACTOR, RAY,
IS COMING OVER

02:55.976 --> 02:57.278
TO THE SECOND APARTMENT.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.512
HE'S GONNA PUT
THE CORNUCOPIA TILE

02:58.546 --> 03:00.348
ON THE OVEN BACKSPLASH.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.749
WHAT? SHUT UP!

03:01.782 --> 03:02.916
TODAY IS
BACKSPLASH DAY?

03:02.950 --> 03:04.918

03:08.322 --> 03:09.390
(Lauren)
THANK YOU SO MUCH

03:09.423 --> 03:10.524
FOR WATCHING HENRY.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.226
I HAVE TO GO FIND
MY SISTER

03:12.260 --> 03:14.695
BECAUSE SHE'S FOLLOWING
THAT STUPID BAND AGAIN.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.697
ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS OKAY?

03:16.730 --> 03:17.698
LAUREN, RELAX.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.400
HENRY AND I WILL BE
TOTALLY FINE.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.269
YOU JUST FOCUS
ON SNAPPING YOUR SISTER

03:21.302 --> 03:23.304
OUT OF KENNY CHESNEY'S
EVIL SPELL.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.273
IT'S SO EMBARRASSING
FOR OUR FAMILY.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.574
THANK YOU.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.409

03:30.444 --> 03:31.111
IF YOU NEED HELP,
CALL ME.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.380
I WON'T,
BUT I WILL CALL YOU.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.614
OKAY.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.615
UH, HEY,

03:34.648 --> 03:36.016
COULDN'T HELP
BUT OVERHEAR

03:36.049 --> 03:37.685
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A KID THIS WEEKEND?

03:37.718 --> 03:39.287
YES, HENRY AND I
ARE GONNA BE HAVING

03:39.320 --> 03:40.588
A MACHO LITTLE
STAG PARTY.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.889

I THINK LAUREN'S

03:41.922 --> 03:42.956
GONNA BE
RATHER IMPRESSED

03:42.990 --> 03:45.259
BY WHAT A MRS. MOM
I CAN BE.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.594
IF YOU NEED HELP,
I ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN

03:46.627 --> 03:48.296
TRYING TO DIP MY TOE
INTO THE BABYSITTING POOL.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.398
OKAY, I DELIVER BABIES
FOR A LIVING.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.899
OR WOULD YOU ASK
YOUR POSTMAN

03:51.932 --> 03:53.901
IF HE NEEDED HELP
BABYSITTING A LETTER?

03:53.934 --> 03:55.002
[laughs]

03:55.035 --> 03:57.004
YEAH, I'M GONNA
TALK TO MY POSTMAN

03:57.037 --> 03:58.372
IN FRONT OF MY DOGS.

03:58.406 --> 03:59.573
[laughs]

03:59.607 --> 04:00.608
NO WAY.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.279
RAY, GREAT JOB
WITH THE BACKSPLASH.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.680
I COULD TASTE
THE BOUNTY FROM HERE.

04:06.714 --> 04:07.681
(Ray)
YEAH.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.782
HEY, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

04:08.816 --> 04:09.783
HOW MUCH WORK
WOULD IT BE

04:09.817 --> 04:11.452
TO COMBINE
MY TWO APARTMENTS?

04:11.485 --> 04:13.287
YOU'D JUST HAVE TO
KNOCK DOWN THIS WALL.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.288
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

04:14.322 --> 04:15.122
I DON'T KNOW.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.824
A LITTLE MORE SPACE
DOWN THE ROAD,

04:16.857 --> 04:18.459
FOR FAMILY.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.560
WELL, BE A COUPLE
OF THOUSAND

04:19.593 --> 04:20.594
IF YOU DO IT
THE LEGAL WAY.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.729
A COUPLE THOUSAND...

04:21.762 --> 04:23.431
A COUPLE OF HUNDRED
IF IT'S JUST ME,

04:23.464 --> 04:24.432
A SLEDGEHAMMER,

04:24.465 --> 04:26.300
AND A PICTURE
OF MY EX-WIFE.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.768
NOW, IF YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE YOUR CLOSET

04:27.801 --> 04:30.338
A WALK-IN, ALL I NEED
IS A CIRCULAR SAW,

04:30.371 --> 04:31.605
A PICTURE OF RACHEL--

04:31.639 --> 04:33.073
OKAY, I'M GONNA STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.708
RAY, YOU GOT
TO GET OVER IT.

04:34.742 --> 04:35.709
(Mindy)
NOW LISTEN UP.

04:35.743 --> 04:36.777
I WANT YOU TO FORGET

04:36.810 --> 04:38.045
EVERYTHING THAT
YOU'VE EVER LEARNED

04:38.078 --> 04:39.780
ABOUT MEDICINE,
SAVE THIS:

04:39.813 --> 04:42.450
NO MATTER HOW GOOD
OF A DOCTOR YOU ARE,

04:42.483 --> 04:44.652
A GOOD BEDSIDE MANNER
WILL TAKE YOU FAR.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.519
WRITE THAT DOWN.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.421
YEAH, BUT DO WE HAVE TIME
TO PERFORM

04:47.455 --> 04:49.590
THREE WAYNE'S WORLD SKETCHES
FOR EVERY PATIENT?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.759
SORRY I CARE, GIGAK.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.327
NOW GO. PARTY ON.

04:53.361 --> 04:54.462
THAT'S A LINE
FROM WAYNE'S WORLD.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.563
OKAY,
GET OUT OF HERE.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.930
HEY, PETER!
SCHWING.

04:56.964 --> 04:57.765
CAN WE GET OUT OF HERE?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.333
I HAD A REALLY ROUGH NIGHT
LAST NIGHT.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.334
I PASSED OUT,
AND MY ROOMMATES

05:00.368 --> 05:01.902
TRIED TO GIVE ME
A WEAVE.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.737
GOD, OKAY, PETER,
NO OFFENSE,

05:03.771 --> 05:05.573
BUT YOUR ROOMMATES
ARE GARBAGE FROM HELL.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.574
YEAH, I KNOW.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.409
IT'S GETTING
REALLY BAD LATELY.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.443
I'M TRYING TO DATE

05:09.477 --> 05:11.612
A MORE, LIKE,
CLASSIER TYPE OF LADY.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.046
LAST WEEK,
I BROUGHT HOME A LAWYER.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.415
SHE GOT LYME DISEASE.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.583
OH, GOD.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.385
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
FIND YOUR OWN PLACE?

05:17.418 --> 05:19.052
I WISH I COULD.
NO ONE WOULD RENT TO ME.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.521
OH, MY GOD,
PETER,

05:20.554 --> 05:22.356
I KNOW WHERE
YOU CAN LIVE.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.058
AH! AH!
HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT!

05:25.092 --> 05:26.994
MMM.
WORTH IT.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.362
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:28.396 --> 05:30.063
THOSE ARE
FOR THE OPEN HOUSE.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.765
DANNY, I ACTUALLY
CANCELED THE OPEN HOUSE,

05:31.799 --> 05:32.566
BECAUSE, GOOD NEWS,

05:32.600 --> 05:33.867
I FOUND YOU
THE PERFECT TENANT.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.404
IT'S PERFECT.
I'LL TAKE IT.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.608
(Danny)
I CAN'T HAVE PETER LIVING HERE.

05:40.641 --> 05:41.675
WHAT IF HE STEALS
MY WI-FI?

05:41.709 --> 05:42.776
(as Borat)
MY WI-FI!

05:42.810 --> 05:44.778
SEE, DANNY,
THAT WAS HILARIOUS.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.079
BIG WHOOP.
EVERYBODY DOES BORAT.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.415
NICE. I LIKE.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.416
WAS THAT A...

05:48.449 --> 05:49.417
BORAT.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.452
OH!
THAT WAS GOOD TOO!

05:51.485 --> 05:52.520
THANKS.

05:52.553 --> 05:53.521
LOOK, PETER IS
OUR FRIEND,

05:53.554 --> 05:54.388
AND WE NEED
TO HELP HIM.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.623
HIS ROOMMATES ARE
BRINGING HIM DOWN.

05:55.656 --> 05:56.790
THIS SINK IS AMAZING.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.459
IT LOOKS LIKE NO ONE'S
PUKED IN IT YET.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.960
AND I INTEND
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.762
HE INTENDS
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY!

06:01.795 --> 06:02.796
I DON'T KNOW.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.797
LOOK,
I HAPPEN TO KNOW

06:03.831 --> 06:05.132
HE'LL PAY
PRACTICALLY ANYTHING

06:05.165 --> 06:06.133
FOR THIS APARTMENT.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.735
DANNY,
I WILL PAY DOUBLE.

06:07.768 --> 06:08.836
I WILL PAY TRIPLE!

06:08.869 --> 06:10.170
I WILL PAY DOUBLE.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.772
LOOK, I JUST--
I REALLY NEED SOME HELP

06:11.805 --> 06:13.774
FINDING A NEW, GROWN-UP
LIVING SITUATION.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.610
RIGHT NOW, I'M A GROWN-UP
WHO'S LIVING LIKE THE SITUATION.

06:16.644 --> 06:17.811
THE SITUATION
IS A CHARACTER

06:17.845 --> 06:19.647
ON A REALITY SHOW
THAT IS--

06:19.680 --> 06:21.014
FINE. FINE.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.015
[whispering]
YES.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.016
BUT THERE ARE RULES.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.117
NO HALOGENS.
NO HOT PLATES.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.819
USE POSTER PUTTY.
NO POSTERS.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.788
AND YOU CAN'T JUST
WALTZ OVER TO MY PLACE
UNANNOUNCED.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.458
YOU GOT IT?
DEAL.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.560
NICOLE, WE HAVE A HOME!

06:32.593 --> 06:33.727
WHO'S NICOLE?

06:33.761 --> 06:34.762
[dog barks]

06:35.829 --> 06:36.830
MY MINI POMERANIAN.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.606
HEY, BABE.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.740
WOW.
SMELLS GREAT.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.909
DID YOU LIGHT ONE OF YOUR
POT-ROAST-SCENTED CANDLES?

06:48.942 --> 06:50.444
(Peter)
OH, NOPE!

06:50.478 --> 06:51.845
THIS IS THE REAL THING.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.582
I NEVER KNEW I COULD COOK
ONE OF THESE

06:54.615 --> 06:55.716
WITHOUT USING
ACTUAL POT.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.586
PETE, WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT STOPPING OVER UNINVITED?

06:58.619 --> 07:00.220
NO, IT'S OKAY.
I INVITED HIM.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.889
HE JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANK YOU

07:01.922 --> 07:03.791
FOR RENTING OUT
YOUR APARTMENT TO HIM.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.559
(Peter)
DUDE, I ALREADY FEEL LIKE
MORE OF AN ADULT.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.027
TODAY I WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT CURTAINS,

07:07.060 --> 07:10.564
AND I CLOSED THEM
BEFORE I...

07:10.598 --> 07:11.565
RELAXED.

07:11.599 --> 07:14.067
SEE? HE SAID "RELAXED"
INSTEAD OF "MASTURBATE."

07:15.603 --> 07:17.838
(Danny)
WOW. THAT WAS FANTASTIC.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.673
PETE, IN MY HOUSE,

07:19.707 --> 07:21.675
THE CHEF DOESN'T
CLEAN UP, OKAY?

07:21.709 --> 07:23.544
MINDY, HOP TO.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.945
WHAT?
OW!

07:24.978 --> 07:26.814
GUYS,
I'M ACTUALLY DONE.

07:26.847 --> 07:27.815
I'M GONNA
HIT THE HAY.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.683
I WISH IT WAS HAY;
I'M ACTUALLY JUST GONNA SLEEP

07:29.717 --> 07:31.218
ON A BUNCH OF
CRUMPLED NEWSPAPERS.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.586
WHEN I TOLD MY ROOMMATES
I WAS MOVING OUT,

07:32.620 --> 07:33.754
THEY STABBED
MY WATERBED.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.755
THANKS, GUYS.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.089
SOUNDS GOOD, PETE.
GOOD NIGHT.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.791
WHAT? NO.
IT DOES NOT SOUND GOOD.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.493
WAIT, PETE, STOP.

07:39.527 --> 07:40.828
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SPEND THE NIGHT

07:40.861 --> 07:42.496
ON SOME FLOOR OF AN APARTMENT
ON NEWSPAPER.

07:42.530 --> 07:43.497
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:43.531 --> 07:45.265
YOU CAN SPEND
THE NIGHT HERE.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.767
WHAT? HERE?
HE'S GONNA SPEND THE NIGHT HERE?

07:46.800 --> 07:47.801
YES.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.137
OKAY, YEAH, PETE.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.772
YOU CAN SPEND THE NIGHT
ON THE COUCH.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.240
OKAY, COOL!

07:53.273 --> 07:54.575
[chuckles]

07:54.608 --> 07:55.609
[grunts]

07:55.643 --> 07:57.678
(Peter)
HEY, WHICH CHANNEL IS SPIKE?

07:57.711 --> 08:00.648
(Mindy)
HEY, BIG BOY, THOSE READING
GLASSES ARE MAKING ME HORNY.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.149
WHAT?
OH, NO.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.150
WE SHOULDN'T DO THAT

08:03.183 --> 08:04.585
'CAUSE PETE'S
RIGHT OUT THERE.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.019
I--I REALLY DON'T WANT HIM
TO KNOW MY NOISES.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.188
(Peter)
I DON'T MIND IF YOU GUYS
NEED TO GET FREAKY!

08:08.221 --> 08:09.723
IN FACT, I INSIST!

08:09.757 --> 08:10.991
HE INSISTS.
COME ON.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.693
NOBODY'S DOING ANYTHING,
PETE.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.761
EVERYBODY'S
GOING TO BED.

08:13.794 --> 08:14.895
GOOD NIGHT!

08:14.928 --> 08:16.597
OKAY, WELL,
I'M ALL WOUND UP.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.698
NOT SLEEPY AT ALL.

08:17.731 --> 08:18.932
I'M GONNA GO WATCH TV
WITH PETER.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.569
PETER, STAY UP!
WE'RE WATCHING TV!

08:21.602 --> 08:23.270
(Peter)
AW, YEAH, GET THAT BUTT

08:23.303 --> 08:24.271
AND WATCH TV WITH ME,

08:24.304 --> 08:26.006
[TV clicks on]

08:26.039 --> 08:27.841
(woman on TV)
I'M NOT GONNA LET CHANTEL
RUIN MY VACATION.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.076
(Peter)
OH, THIS IS THAT REALITY SHOW

08:29.109 --> 08:31.645
ABOUT THE BLACK BEAUTY SHOP
THAT'S ON A BOAT.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.547
CAN YOU TURN IT DOWN,
PLEASE?

08:33.581 --> 08:34.815
(man on TV)
OR I'M GONNA PULL

OKAY, WHY DON'T

08:36.917 --> 08:38.251
I SING YOU A BRITISH LULLABY,

WHOA!

08:51.665 --> 08:53.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
MORGAN?

08:53.233 --> 08:54.568
OKAY, I KNEW
YOU WOULD NEED MY HELP,

08:54.602 --> 08:56.036
WHETHER OR NOT
YOU ADMITTED IT, ALL RIGHT?

08:56.069 --> 08:57.270
AND RULE NUMBER ONE
WITH A BABY:

08:57.304 --> 08:58.772
DON'T USE IT
AS A HUMAN SHIELD.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.073
OH, MY GOD.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.241
TRUTH BE TOLD,
MORGAN,

09:01.274 --> 09:02.710
I'M DOING A BIT
OF A BOTCH JOB.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.745
OH, GOD, HE'S CRYING
MORE THAN MOTHER

09:04.778 --> 09:05.879
WHEN WE SOLD
WORMWOOD MANOR

09:05.913 --> 09:07.014
TO THE SAUDIS.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.181
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.617
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GIVE UP. I GIVE UP.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.784
PLEASE, JUST--
JUST--JUST HOLD HIM.

09:10.818 --> 09:11.752
JUST HOLD HIM.
IT'S OKAY.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.253
OKAY, COME HERE.
IT'S OKAY.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.823
COME HERE.
YEAH.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.825
[crying stops]

09:17.858 --> 09:19.660
DID HE JUST
STOP CRYING?

09:20.728 --> 09:22.162
HE HATES ME.
NO.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.831
YEAH, LIKE
EVERYBODY HATES ME.

09:23.864 --> 09:24.665
OH, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.967
HE'S JUST REMEMBERING
HOW GREAT IT WAS

09:27.000 --> 09:28.301
WHEN YOU WERE
HOLDING HIM,

09:28.335 --> 09:29.903
AND THAT'S WHY
HE STOPPED CRYING.

09:29.937 --> 09:30.904
YOU THINK SO?

09:30.938 --> 09:32.239
YES, I DO.
HERE. TRY IT AGAIN.

WHAT THE HELL, DUDE?
YOU GRABBED MY BUTT!

10:34.267 --> 10:35.268
I WAS CONFUSED.

YOU ARE A BEARD.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.253
OH, NO.
IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.022
WHY DID YOU LET PETER
USE OUR SHOWER?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.023
SHE DIDN'T.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.057
I HAD TO USE YOUR SHOWER

10:57.090 --> 10:59.126
BECAUSE MY DOG, NICOLE,
IS ASLEEP ON THE T-SHIRT

10:59.159 --> 11:00.127
I USE AS A TOWEL.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.294

REASONS, DANNY!

11:01.328 --> 11:02.162
NO.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.297
I TOLD YOU
ABOUT STOPPING OVER UNINVITED.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.432
OKAY, WE DON'T NEED
A KRAMER,

AND IF WE NEEDED ONE,

11:06.834 --> 11:08.301
MORGAN'S
MORE THAT ENERGY.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.336
I'M SORRY, PETE.

RULES ARE RULES.
YOU'RE OUT.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.372
OKAY, OKAY, WAIT.
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.374
SWEETHEART, I AM
SO SORRY THAT HAPPENED.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.209
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU
WALKING IN THERE

11:16.243 --> 11:17.745
THINKING IT WAS
MY BEAUTIFUL BODY

11:17.778 --> 11:18.846
AND THEN HAPPENING
UPON HIM.

11:18.879 --> 11:19.847
BUT, DANNY,
YOU CAN'T

11:19.880 --> 11:21.114
KICK HIM OUT
OF THE APARTMENT.

11:21.148 --> 11:21.949
WE'RE JUST BEGINNING

11:21.982 --> 11:23.416
TO WEAN HIM
BACK INTO SOCIETY, OKAY?

ALL RIGHT, FINE.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.324
YOU CAN STAY,
BUT FROM NOW ON,

11:31.358 --> 11:32.993
YOU'RE BANNED
FROM THIS APARTMENT, OKAY?

11:33.026 --> 11:34.828
YOU DON'T BOTHER US,
AND WE DON'T BOTHER YOU.

11:34.862 --> 11:35.829
GOT IT?

11:35.863 --> 11:37.030
VERY WELL.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.276
(Jeremy)
WELL, IT'S BEEN
THE WORST NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.878
[sighs]
I'M LEAVING.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.379
THANK YOU, MORGAN.
I WON'T PAY YOU.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.380
BUT YOU CAN HAVE

11:53.413 --> 11:54.848
ALL THE SODA
YOU CAN DRINK.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.249
OKAY, IT WOULD BE
CHEAPER TO PAY ME.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.250
I JUST WANT
TO SAY THAT.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.451
IF YOU NEED ME,
I'M GONNA CATCH

11:58.485 --> 11:59.953
A MATINEE OF WAGNER--

11:59.987 --> 12:02.289
DEPRESSING,
ANTI-SEMITIC, SURE,

12:02.322 --> 12:03.924
BUT MORE FUN
THAN HERE.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.358
ALL RIGHT, CAN I SAY
SOMETHING REAL QUICK?

12:05.392 --> 12:06.927
WHAT?
YOU SHOULD STAY.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.328
I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL,
I CAN TEACH YOU

12:08.361 --> 12:09.830
HOW TO PUT
THIS LITTLE PORK CHOP TO BED.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.098
AND ALSO,
YOU TOLD LAUREN

12:11.131 --> 12:12.499
THAT YOU WOULD DO THIS.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.366
YEAH, IT'S A NICE THOUGHT,
MORGAN,

12:13.400 --> 12:15.035
BUT I DON'T THINK
I HAVE A PATERNAL BONE

12:15.068 --> 12:16.036
IN MY BODY.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.370
SORRY.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.272
(Henry)
PETER.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.776
DID HE JUST SAY
"PETER"?

12:22.810 --> 12:24.544
I THINK HE SAID "PITA,"

12:24.577 --> 12:26.446
AS IN
THE MIDDLE EASTERN BREAD,

12:26.479 --> 12:28.415
AND DEFINITELY
NOT PETER,

12:28.448 --> 12:29.850
LAUREN'S EX-BOYFRIEND

12:29.883 --> 12:31.351
AND OUR COWORKER.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.419
MORGAN,
PUT THE COFFEE ON.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.253
YOU'RE GONNA TEACH ME

12:33.286 --> 12:34.554
HOW TO MAKE
THIS STUPID BABY LIKE ME,

12:34.587 --> 12:37.090
OR MY NAME ISN'T

12:40.460 --> 12:42.395
OH, I DIDN'T
ORDER ANY FOOD.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.832
HI. I'M RAY.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.366
DANNY WANTED ME
TO CHANGE THE LOCKS.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.568
HE SAID HE WAS THE VICTIM
OF A BATHROOM INVASION.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.170
HEY, WHILE YOU'RE HERE,
I'D LOVE IT

12:50.203 --> 12:51.271
IF YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK
AT THE SHOWER

12:51.304 --> 12:53.440
AND SEE IF YOU CAN INSTALL
ONE OF THOSE OLD LADY SEATS.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.441
I GET SO TIRED.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.442
I CAN TAKE A LOOK.

12:55.475 --> 12:56.810
OH, I CHECKED
WITH THE CITY,

12:56.844 --> 12:58.278
AND WE CAN KNOCK DOWN
THAT WALL,

12:58.311 --> 13:00.413
SO YOU GUYS CAN COMBINE
DANNY'S TWO APARTMENTS.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.414
HMM?

13:01.448 --> 13:02.449
HE SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT

13:02.482 --> 13:04.317
WANTING TO MAKE ROOM
FOR FAMILY.

13:04.351 --> 13:07.087
FAMILY? FAMILY?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.355
RAY, COME HERE.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.256
MY SWEET RAY.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.824
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MY WHOLE LIFE.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.425
A MAN WANTS ME
TO MOVE IN WITH HIM.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.161
TELL ME
YOUR NAME AGAIN.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.495
I'M MINDY,
RAY, OBVIOUSLY.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.064
OKAY, I GOT TO GO.
EXCUSE ME!

13:18.398 --> 13:19.499
HEY, NEIGHBOR!

13:19.532 --> 13:20.467
PETER,
YOU'RE EVICTED.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.835
WHAT?

13:21.869 --> 13:23.003
DANNY WANTS TO COMBINE
THE TWO APARTMENTS

13:23.036 --> 13:24.171
SO THAT I CAN
MOVE IN WITH HIM.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.472
SO YOU GOT TO GO.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.174
GOD, WHAT SHOULD I DO
WITH THE PLACE

13:27.207 --> 13:28.175
ONCE IT'S MINE?

13:28.208 --> 13:29.542
I WAS THINKING LIKE

13:29.576 --> 13:31.879
A "STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE
MEETS SADDAM'S PALACE" VIBE.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.446
OKAY, I'M BEING
INSENSITIVE.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.182
I'M VERY SORRY.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.183
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO GO.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.184
I'M DOING SO WELL

13:37.217 --> 13:38.418
LIVING NEXT TO
YOU AND DANNY.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.486
I KNOW!
I THINK WE FIXED YOU.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.054
I THINK
YOU SHOULD MOVE ON.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.156
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT
YOU BOUGHT GROCERIES TODAY?

13:43.190 --> 13:44.858
YEAH, AND THEN I LEFT THEM
AT A STRIP CLUB.

13:44.892 --> 13:45.859
DAMN IT.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.260
I'M A MESS.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.096
LOOK, I'M SO SORRY, PETER,

13:49.129 --> 13:50.563
BUT I'M, LIKE,
200 YEARS OLD, OKAY?

13:50.597 --> 13:52.099
I GOT TO LOCK THIS DOWN.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.200
I FINALLY
FOUND A BOYFRIEND

13:53.233 --> 13:55.035
WITH A PERFECTLY
PROPORTIONED PENIS.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.904
DO YOU KNOW HOW RARE
THAT IS IN MANHATTAN?

13:56.937 --> 13:57.905
I'M GONNA HOLD ON
TO HIM

13:57.938 --> 13:59.239
UNTIL A CORONER
DRAGS ME AWAY.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.240
I'M SORRY, PETER.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.441
I JUST NEED THIS
MORE THAN YOU.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.110
VERY WELL.

14:03.143 --> 14:06.413
I THINK I SEE
THE WRITING ON THE WALL.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.481
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT
BY THE WAY.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.084
I WILL BE OUT OF THE APARTMENT
BY THE MORNING,

14:11.118 --> 14:12.385
BUT UNTIL THEN,
IT IS MINE.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.187
THANK YOU.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.256
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

14:16.289 --> 14:17.524
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE
A CRAZY SPINSTER,

14:17.557 --> 14:19.026
AND I DIDN'T
EXPECT THAT FROM YOU

14:19.059 --> 14:20.560
FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS,
AND I DON'T KNOW

14:20.593 --> 14:21.895
WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH YOU AND DANNY,

14:21.929 --> 14:23.430
BUT THIS IS PATHETIC.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.398
BE THAT AS IT MAY,

14:25.432 --> 14:26.566
THIS IS HOW IT IS.

14:26.599 --> 14:27.567
I'M SO SORRY.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.069
NICOLE, PLEASE
SEE THIS JERK

14:29.102 --> 14:30.403
TO HER APARTMENT.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.638

14:32.973 --> 14:35.308
I FORGOT HER

(Jeremy)
MORGAN, EXPLAIN TO ME AGAIN
WHY YOU'RE SHIRTLESS.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.381
'CAUSE A VERY WISE WOMAN
ONCE SAID TO ME,

14:41.414 --> 14:43.083
"IF WITH A BABY
YOU WANT TO WIN,

14:43.116 --> 14:44.617
ALWAYS GO
SKIN TO SKIN."

14:44.651 --> 14:46.019
DO YOU KNOW
WHO THAT WOMAN WAS?

14:46.053 --> 14:47.587
THAT WAS DOCTOR...

14:47.620 --> 14:48.588
IT WAS MINDY.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.323
I WAS GONNA SAY IT,

14:52.459 --> 14:53.426
YOU'RE UP NEXT,

HE'S LAUGHING.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.715
WHY IS HE LAUGHING?

15:15.748 --> 15:17.184

WHEN YOU HURT YOURSELF.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.585
HURT YOURSELF AGAIN.
HURT YOURSELF AGAIN.

15:18.618 --> 15:19.552

15:44.577 --> 15:45.445
NO, I WOULD NEVER

ARE THROWING ME
A GOING-AWAY PARTY

16:33.526 --> 16:35.195
TO PROTEST
MY EVICTION.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.496
PETE, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON, MAN?

16:36.529 --> 16:38.531
I CHECKED THE MICROWAVE.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.438
I WOULDN'T USE ANYTHING
LIKE THAT

16:45.472 --> 16:46.506
EVEN IF I WASN'T

16:47.374 --> 16:49.209
HEY, MAN, YOU BETTER

I KNOW YOU WANT

SO I CAN KILL YOU

18:10.890 --> 18:12.559
FOR WHAT YOU DID
TO MY APARTMENT.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.693
LOOK, I ONLY
THREW THAT PARTY

18:13.726 --> 18:15.762
BECAUSE MINDY EVICTED ME
WITH NO WARNING.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.530
YEAH, WELL, I GOT A BONE
TO PICK WITH HER TOO.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.598
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

18:18.631 --> 18:20.133
WHY SHE'S SO UPSET
WITH ME.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.768
DUDE,
YOU READ HER DIARY.

18:21.801 --> 18:22.902
YOU KNOW MINDY'S ALL IN.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.405
SO WHEN YOU START TALKING
ABOUT KNOCKING DOWN WALLS,

18:25.438 --> 18:26.806
SHE'S GONNA THINK
THAT YOU'RE ALL IN TOO.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.341
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.343
WE HAVE BEEN GETTING
REAL CLOSE LATELY.

18:30.377 --> 18:32.545
SHE ADMITTED TO ME
THAT SHE'S IN HER 30s.

18:32.579 --> 18:33.546
SHUT UP.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.282
SHE SWEARS TO ME
SHE'S 24.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.203
YOU KNOW WHAT, PETE?

18:56.236 --> 18:58.205
I THINK YOU SHOULD
SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME

18:58.238 --> 18:59.372
AT MY OTHER PLACE.

18:59.406 --> 19:00.473
ARE YOU BEING
SERIOUS?

19:02.942 --> 19:03.910
IN YOUR WASHING MACHINE?

19:03.943 --> 19:06.145
[sighs]
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.916
OH, WHEREVER DID I LEAVE
MY BANANA PEEL?

19:09.949 --> 19:11.584
OH, IT'S THERE.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.620
COCCYX, FORGIVE ME.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.488
[hissing]

19:16.523 --> 19:17.524
[whispering]
OH, MY GOD.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.329
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.396
AND, LISTEN,
I KNOW I TRIED

19:23.430 --> 19:24.397
TO BAIL ON YOU
SEVEN OR EIGHT TIMES...

19:24.431 --> 19:25.198
YEAH, YOU DID.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.199
BUT THANK YOU
FOR STICKING WITH ME.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.468
AND, LISTEN, I OWE YOU
WAY MORE THAN SODA, SO...

19:28.501 --> 19:30.237
OH, NO, NO, COME ON.
THAT'S CRAZY.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.404
COME ON, COME ON.
THAT'S--

19:31.438 --> 19:33.606
ALL RIGHT.

19:33.640 --> 19:34.841
LAUREN IS GONNA BE
SO IMPRESSED.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.243
OH, YEAH,
SHE'S GONNA WANT YOU

19:36.276 --> 19:37.544
TO WATCH HENRY
ALL THE TIME.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.645
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.247
I MEAN, THIS COULD BE
YOUR LIFE NOW.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.548
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.

19:41.581 --> 19:42.649
OH, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO...

19:42.682 --> 19:43.683
YES.

19:43.716 --> 19:44.951
BUT WHAT IF I DON'T WANT
ANY OF THAT?

19:44.984 --> 19:46.553
WHAT IF I JUST WANTED
A GIRLFRIEND

19:46.586 --> 19:48.988
AND I HADN'T THOUGHT
ANY OF THIS THROUGH?

19:49.021 --> 19:51.924
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

19:51.958 --> 19:52.925
OH, DEAR.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.461
I'LL SEE YOU MONDAY.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.928
THAT BABY'S
GOT TO SLEEP.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.297
OKAY.

19:58.465 --> 19:59.466
BYE, BUDDY.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.469
[crashing]

20:02.502 --> 20:05.372
[clattering]

20:05.405 --> 20:08.375
[Henry crying]

20:08.408 --> 20:09.642
BYE.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.411
[crying continues]

20:12.679 --> 20:14.314
[door opens]

20:14.347 --> 20:15.482
HEY.

20:15.515 --> 20:16.649
HEY.

20:16.683 --> 20:17.784
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

20:17.817 --> 20:18.951
YOU TOLD ME,
IN YOUR CULTURE,

20:18.985 --> 20:20.353
CLEANING
IS A MAN'S JOB.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.187
IT IS.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.822
I JUST WANTED THE PLACE
TO LOOK NICE

20:22.855 --> 20:24.557
FOR WHEN YOUR MOM
MOVED IN.

20:24.591 --> 20:25.492
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THAT?

20:25.525 --> 20:26.493
SURE.

20:26.526 --> 20:27.294
WHEN I WAS THINKING

20:27.327 --> 20:28.961
ABOUT HAVING MY MOM
MOVE IN, THAT--

20:28.995 --> 20:30.730
I'M TALKING DOWN THE LINE,
IN THE FUTURE,

20:30.763 --> 20:32.832
WHEN HER BONES
FINALLY TURN TO DUST.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.834
SHE'S GOT TO TAKE
THE YOGURT FOR HER BONES.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.669
PROMISE ME YOU'LL TAKE YOGURT
FOR YOUR BONES.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.505
DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT YOGURT,

20:38.538 --> 20:39.872
OR DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT US?

20:41.541 --> 20:42.642
LOOK,

20:42.675 --> 20:44.511
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT IT,

20:44.544 --> 20:46.379
REALLY, REALLY NERVOUS.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.682
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO MOVE IN,

20:49.716 --> 20:51.584
I WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.054
NO, IT'S OKAY,
DANNY.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.424
LOOK, I JUST WANT TO BE
WITH SOMEONE

20:57.457 --> 20:59.892
WHO'S AS EXCITED
AND CERTAIN AS I AM

20:59.926 --> 21:01.294
ABOUT OUR FUTURE.

21:01.328 --> 21:02.595
AND IF YOU'RE NOT,
THAT'S FINE.

21:02.629 --> 21:03.996
JUST LET ME KNOW.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.666
BECAUSE HONESTLY,
I'M GONNA BE FINE

21:06.699 --> 21:08.067
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.602
YOU WILL?

21:09.636 --> 21:11.471
HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.375
WHAT IF I WANT
TO MOVE IN WITH YOU?

21:15.408 --> 21:17.544
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD
ASK ME SOMETIME,

21:17.577 --> 21:19.912
WHEN YOU'RE NOT
REALLY, REALLY NERVOUS.

21:25.552 --> 21:27.554
[rustling]

21:27.587 --> 21:28.555
[groans]

21:28.588 --> 21:29.556
THAT'S A GOOD WOMAN.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.023
YOU BETTER HANG ON
TO HER.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.525
GET OUT
OF MY APARTMENT.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.594
[belches]
YOU WANT TO GET SOME BREAKFAST?
