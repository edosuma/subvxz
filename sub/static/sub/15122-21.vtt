WEBVTT

00:12.180 --> 00:15.583
Burt, it's been
15 minutes.

00:15.649 --> 00:19.420
I don't think the
boomerang's coming back.

00:19.487 --> 00:22.756
They're supposed to always
come back.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.758
WOMAN (over monitor):
This isn't what I signed up for!

00:24.825 --> 00:26.894
(crying)
This wasn't supposed
to be like this.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.064
What the hell is that?
Somebody in Hope's room?

00:30.131 --> 00:32.400
Relax. I saw this
on Modern Family

00:32.466 --> 00:33.767
and countless other sitcoms.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.035
We're just picking up a signal

00:35.103 --> 00:36.036
from somebody else's
baby monitor.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.471
(monitor squeaks,
whimpered crying)

00:37.538 --> 00:41.209
I swear to God, it's all
I can do not to smack you.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.611
There are toys
all over the floor...

00:43.677 --> 00:45.679
...and somebody's been teething
on my shoe.

00:45.746 --> 00:48.616
There she is.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.551
Do I seem like I'm
kidding to you?

00:50.618 --> 00:52.220
Does it say something
bad about me

00:52.286 --> 00:54.455
that I assumed
she'd be fat?

00:54.522 --> 00:56.557
Yeah, you got to work on that.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.426
I do.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.661
This place is
a disaster.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.296
I am sick and tired
of being your mother.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.531
(whimpered crying)

01:05.466 --> 01:06.934
(crying):
I'm sorry.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.069
I was having bathroom distress,

01:09.137 --> 01:11.705
and I didn't know
the dogs got out.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.241
That is why we have

01:13.307 --> 01:15.042
the puppy monitor, you idiot.

01:15.109 --> 01:17.345
You're supposed to take it
to the bathroom with you.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.580
(crying):
I forgot.

01:19.647 --> 01:20.881
(whimpering)

01:20.948 --> 01:23.484
Oh.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.819
I really wish
I hadn't seen that.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.257
* Whoo *

01:29.323 --> 01:33.561
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

01:33.627 --> 01:35.529
(peppy commercial
theme song plays)

01:35.596 --> 01:38.532
Here at Howdy's, we're not like
the big, fancy chains.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.768
We don't have
ten different types of apples.

01:40.834 --> 01:43.371
We just have apples.

01:43.437 --> 01:47.875
They're cheap and round and red,
the way God intended.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.312
Howdy's. 'Cause life is
confusing enough.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.716
As you all know, last year,
for the fifth year in a row,

01:55.783 --> 01:57.751
the store owners chose
to go with a commercial

01:57.818 --> 01:59.220
that was submitted
by Howdy's West

01:59.287 --> 02:00.554
instead of the one
submitted by me.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.690
Which is crazy,
because mine was awesome.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.558
(peppy commercial theme song
plays)

02:04.625 --> 02:07.361
I'm Barney Hughes, head...

02:07.428 --> 02:09.697
manager of Howdy's Market.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.832
Lettuce...

02:11.899 --> 02:13.301
save you money on groceries.

02:13.367 --> 02:16.170
Orange you glad
our prices are...

02:16.237 --> 02:17.471
bananas?

02:17.538 --> 02:19.840
Anyone who says
they have better prices

02:19.907 --> 02:21.275
is full of baloney.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.710
Anyway, this year I thought,

02:22.776 --> 02:24.845
why keep hogging
all this potential glory?

02:24.912 --> 02:26.814
Why not involve all of you

02:26.880 --> 02:29.149
to make a commercial
to defeat Howdy's West

02:29.217 --> 02:30.851
and as an opportunity
to do some...

02:30.918 --> 02:32.620
teamwork?

02:32.686 --> 02:35.723
And how did they
build the pyramids?

02:35.789 --> 02:36.957
With slaves.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.926
A team of slaves.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.561
Anyway, the
point is,

02:40.628 --> 02:42.863
when we finish our commercial,
we can look at it

02:42.930 --> 02:44.698
as something we accomplished
together, as a team.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.267
Okay.
Yeah, that
sounds awesome.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.202
I'm in.
Great.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.337
So, let's brainstorm,
and remember,

02:49.403 --> 02:50.971
don't be afraid
to think outside the box.

02:51.038 --> 02:54.275
Nobody's done blackface
on TV for a while.

02:54.342 --> 02:57.678
Maybe Frank should think
inside the box.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.851
Burt!

03:03.917 --> 03:05.152
What the heck are...?

03:05.219 --> 03:08.489
Shh. This is the best place in
the house to get reception.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.057
WOMAN:
Just once, I would love

03:10.123 --> 03:12.460
to come home and find you doing
something. Anything!

03:12.526 --> 03:14.462
Five minutes ago,
she called him a jackass,

03:14.528 --> 03:16.397
and then either threw him
through a window

03:16.464 --> 03:17.565
or emptied the dishwasher

03:17.631 --> 03:19.367
very angrily,
but either way,

03:19.433 --> 03:20.801
it made
for very compelling radio.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.203
Get down from there before
you knock over the chicken.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.607
And stop meddling

03:26.674 --> 03:28.276
in other peoples' lives.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.910
This poor guy-- I'm
worried about him.

03:29.977 --> 03:30.944
He's being abused.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.180
I don't care.
We mind our own business.

03:33.247 --> 03:35.716
I am not gonna be
one of those judgmental

03:35.783 --> 03:37.084
busybody snoops,

03:37.150 --> 03:39.887
because I've seen what it's like
from the other side.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.755
"Your baby needs sunscreen on."

03:41.822 --> 03:43.691
"Your husband shouldn't pee
off the side of the porch."

03:43.757 --> 03:45.626
"You need to replace
that dead, ugly bush

03:45.693 --> 03:47.060
by the side of your porch."

03:47.127 --> 03:48.396
I don't want to be like that.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.331
Please, Virginia!

03:50.398 --> 03:51.732
They're about to go to bed.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.200
If I don't hear the last scene,
I'll have no idea

03:53.267 --> 03:54.968
what's going
on tomorrow.

03:55.035 --> 03:58.171
Plus, I'll be
restless all night.
(sighs)

03:58.238 --> 03:59.440
WOMAN:
If I get home

03:59.507 --> 04:00.708
from work tomorrow,

04:00.774 --> 04:02.410
and you haven't pulled
that tree stump

04:02.476 --> 04:04.645
out of the front lawn,
I'm gonna do it myself.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.347
And bury you in the hole.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.148
The plot thickens.

04:08.215 --> 04:11.118
Okay, well, here's something
everybody should be happy with.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.987
A list of low-priced items,
a slow jazz song,

04:14.054 --> 04:16.690
panic and a rhinoceros.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.992
Guys, I-I just don't
get the rhinoceros.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.429
It has absolutely nothing
to do with groceries.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.964
Come on. The store needs
a mascot.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.499
Howdy, the friendly rhino.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.901
He doesn't charge... much.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.703
Barney, it shouldn't
say panic.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.539
It should say
widespread panic.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.206
'Cause nothing
sells groceries

04:33.273 --> 04:35.443
like fear
of an impending disaster.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.145
Frank, it seems wrong
to scare people for no reason.

04:38.211 --> 04:41.148
How many more dead birds
got to fall from the sky

04:41.214 --> 04:42.783
before you people wake up?

04:42.850 --> 04:43.651
This is pointless.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.453
I quit.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.020
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, no quitting.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.556
Uh, how about this?

04:48.622 --> 04:51.091
What if you three each
make your own commercial?

04:51.158 --> 04:52.426
And then share them
with the group,

04:52.493 --> 04:54.294
and then together,
as a team,

04:54.362 --> 04:55.763
we'll make decisions
collectively?

04:55.829 --> 04:59.299
It'll be individuals working
within a larger framework.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.602
Like Al Qaeda.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.938
I was thinking the Smurfs,
but... yes.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.076
(grunts)

05:09.142 --> 05:11.512
(loud groaning)

05:12.980 --> 05:15.015
(grunting)

05:17.385 --> 05:18.952
No, no, no, no.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.220
(gasps)

05:20.287 --> 05:21.489
(grunting)

05:21.555 --> 05:23.424
(snap)
Whoa!

05:35.403 --> 05:37.004
Yes?
Hi.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.072
I'm Burt Chance.
Live around the block.

05:39.139 --> 05:43.477
I am also the president and CEO
and owner and proprietor

05:43.544 --> 05:45.579
of Better Lawn Service
and Pool Cleaning.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.047
And I'm one stump away
from getting

05:47.114 --> 05:48.516
my advanced certificate
in stump removal.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.784
It would mean a lot to me
if you would let me

05:50.851 --> 05:53.887
remove that stump there
and achieve my dream.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.824
(crying)

06:01.094 --> 06:04.832
(peppy commercial
theme song plays)
We're a store.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.704
We have food,
if that's your thing.

06:10.771 --> 06:14.241
I'm Frank, I'm an open-minded,
single white male.

06:14.307 --> 06:17.911
I'm a Pisces, who
was born in the year of the rat.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.119
You could go to other stores,
spend more money,

06:26.186 --> 06:29.156
and get higher quality stuff
that tastes a lot better,

06:29.222 --> 06:30.758
but what's the point?

06:30.824 --> 06:32.993
'Cause it all eventually
ends up in your toilet.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.766
So come by if you want.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.300
Or don't. Whatever.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.334
I don't care.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.570
I don't own the place.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.939
If I did,
it'd be called Frank's.

06:46.006 --> 06:51.011
But it's not.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.680
Okay.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.115
Uh, who has some
positive, constructive,

06:55.182 --> 06:57.685
team-building comments
about Frank's video?

07:00.521 --> 07:03.056
Okay. Good
stuff, team.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.493
We'll watch the
next one tomorrow.

07:08.962 --> 07:12.099
You sure I can't thank you
with a puppy or two?

07:12.165 --> 07:14.702
Not all of them
have had their toes chewed on.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.904
They-They just like
picking on the runt.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.474
I feel bad
for you, bro.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.543
Little fella stuck
in the house,

07:22.610 --> 07:24.945
getting chewed
out all day.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.581
You probably need to talk
to somebody, don't you, fella?

07:27.648 --> 07:29.817
You could talk to me.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.486
He won't talk.
He's a puppy.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.488
Hey, lovey-dove.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.890
Notice anything different
about the yard, like

07:36.957 --> 07:39.326
something's gone
that was weighing on your mind?

07:39.392 --> 07:42.563
Something that shaped like
a stump, 'cause it's a stump.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.031
(laughs)
Yeah.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.634
I see it's gone.
Thank you.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.736
This is Burt.
He lives down the street,

07:48.802 --> 07:50.370
and he also owns
a landscaping company.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.839
He did it for free.

07:51.905 --> 07:52.940
Oh, Andrew did half the work.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.041
More than half.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.242
Three times that much.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.910
Plus, he got me an iced tea.
He's good.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.812
I see there's a lot of mud.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.048
When you went
to go get him his iced tea,

08:01.114 --> 08:02.783
please tell me
you wiped your feet

08:02.850 --> 08:04.217
before you walked
on my white carpet.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.123
I might have forgotten
to do that.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.593
Oh. Oh, did you
forget you had feet?

08:12.660 --> 08:14.027
Forget we had a floor?

08:14.094 --> 08:15.462
I mean, how many times
have we practiced

08:15.529 --> 08:16.463
wiping your feet on the mat?

08:16.530 --> 08:17.798
Burt, I am so sorry that

08:17.865 --> 08:19.499
he put you in a position
to have to see this.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.002
Do you have any idea how
uncomfortable you make people

08:22.069 --> 08:23.837
when they witness the way
you disappoint me?

08:26.473 --> 08:27.875
Huh.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.611
She's under a lot
of career stress.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.245
What does she do?

08:32.312 --> 08:34.181
WOMAN:
No! My carpet!

08:34.247 --> 08:37.985
$35 a square yard,
and you got mud on it?!

08:38.051 --> 08:39.486
God, you idiot!

08:39.553 --> 08:42.656
She makes relaxation candles.

08:42.723 --> 08:45.859
Burt, why are you
infusiating yourself

08:45.926 --> 08:47.628
into other peoples' lives?

08:47.695 --> 08:49.697
I like the guy.
He reminds me of me.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.799
We both have brown hair
and hate museums.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.334
Not on the
eyeballs, Maw Maw.

08:54.401 --> 08:55.736
Oh, okay.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.137
What's crazy up to?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.906
VIRGINIA:
Oh, homemade facelift.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.741
She saw it in an
old people magazine.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.242
Is that an old copy

09:02.309 --> 09:05.613
of People Magazine, or
a magazine called Old People?

09:05.679 --> 09:06.914
What does it
matter, Burt?

09:06.980 --> 09:08.281
She's putting tape
on her face.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.818
Look, you need to stay out
of these peoples' lives.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.253
You know how much
I despise nosey neighbors.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.989
But we could make a sad home
as happy as ours.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.991
His wife could learn
to not be so mean.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.493
She'd just need to see
how you do things.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.695
How is she gonna see that?

09:21.762 --> 09:23.363
I invited them for dinner.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.465
What?! No. No.

09:25.532 --> 09:28.035
See, now we're those people who

09:28.101 --> 09:29.970
butt in and fix and

09:30.037 --> 09:31.138
judge and...

09:31.204 --> 09:32.840
We're not better
than a lot of people,

09:32.906 --> 09:34.207
but we are better
than those people.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.409
Why would you want
to take that from us?

09:36.476 --> 09:38.578
Because you're the cool wife.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.413
All she knows how to
be is a bitch wife.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.684
So to see you be all mellow
and not yelling about stuff...

09:43.751 --> 09:45.018
It's like this right now.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.453
You're annoyed,
but you're mellow,

09:46.519 --> 09:48.121
and not freaking out at me.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.122
She needs to see stuff

09:49.189 --> 09:50.791
just like this
you're doing now.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.125
So terrifically.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.393
Hmm?
(sighs)

09:53.460 --> 09:56.229
Because you're cool.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.899
Well... I am a cool wife.

09:58.966 --> 10:01.134
That's what she
needs to see.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.836
How do I look?

10:02.903 --> 10:04.337
Needs a little more work.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.610
* *

10:10.678 --> 10:13.380
MAN:
In the land of Natesvillia,

10:13.446 --> 10:17.050
food shopping
was dangerously expensive

10:17.117 --> 10:21.288
until a hero rose up
and said, "No more!"

10:21.354 --> 10:23.256
I'm Sir Barnalot,

10:23.323 --> 10:25.192
the price protector.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.860
He who strikes down
the grocery goblin

10:26.927 --> 10:28.095
who jacks up prices.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.830
(whirring)

10:29.897 --> 10:31.331
They... (coughs)

10:31.398 --> 10:33.701
...want to charge four dollars
for a gallon of milk,

10:33.767 --> 10:34.735
but I say no!

10:34.802 --> 10:38.138
(whirring)

10:38.205 --> 10:39.406
Forsooth.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.009
That's more like it.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.578
You are ruining my world!

10:45.645 --> 10:47.147
(screaming)

10:49.817 --> 10:51.919
And I'm just getting started.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.561
My prices!

11:01.628 --> 11:05.032
My prices!

11:06.599 --> 11:09.236
That's not fair. You used
the boss in your commercial.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.438
No, not-not boss.
Team captain.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.473
Okay, but that's got
to be against the rules.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.742
There aren't any rules.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.778
Jimmy, you are
a brown-nosing weasel.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.780
But, team captain,

11:19.847 --> 11:22.349
you were really terrific.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.284
Oh, you. Thanks.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.053
Well, the fat camp I went
to through high school

11:26.119 --> 11:27.554
did some terrific
diet-based theater.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.456
Oh.

11:29.522 --> 11:33.093
I really like
that skinny sunset picture.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.995
I'm not usually into art,

11:35.062 --> 11:36.296
but that one caught my eye.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.399
Oops! Clumsy me.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.700
Oh, God.
Your wife's going to kill you.

11:40.768 --> 11:41.769
We've got
to hide the glasses

11:41.835 --> 11:43.336
and find something
to cover that.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.171
Whoa. It's cool.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.773
No, no, no!
It's on the rug!

11:45.839 --> 11:48.441
There's red wine on the rug.
That's a class two stain.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.480
Are you kidding me?

11:53.546 --> 11:54.882
Burt did it. It was Burt. Burt.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.750
Sorry, Burt.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.551
Oh. Do you need us to step out,

11:58.618 --> 11:59.652
so you can tear him a new one?

11:59.719 --> 12:02.522
Oh, well, first of all,

12:02.589 --> 12:04.191
I can't see why I'd want him
to have two of those.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.894
Second of all, it's no big deal.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.728
Mistakes happen.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.198
You're such a cool wife.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.866
No biggie.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.367
I'll just get you
a towel and a refill.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.004
Burt is so clumsy.
At this point,

12:17.070 --> 12:18.338
we might as well
just drink the rug.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.007
(Burt laughing)

12:20.073 --> 12:22.209
That is some
good-natured ribbing.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.347
Andrew, where are
the crackers we brought?

12:28.715 --> 12:31.251
You brought
saltines?

12:31.318 --> 12:32.652
You don't bring saltines
to someone's house.

12:32.719 --> 12:35.722
You bring cracked pepper
water crackers, you idiot.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.291
It's fine. We like saltines.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.260
Love 'em. I can
eat six of them

12:40.327 --> 12:42.562
in a minute with no beverage.
Nine if there's butter on 'em.

12:42.629 --> 12:43.997
Really, it's no big deal.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.469
I'm gonna run home and get
the good crackers I forgot.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.042
SABRINA:
Come on down to Howdy's Market

12:55.108 --> 12:57.177
where prices
are like the 1960s.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.246
* *

13:02.816 --> 13:04.918
* Where do hip kids
like to shop? *

13:04.985 --> 13:07.620
* Howdy's, Howdy's *

13:07.687 --> 13:10.123
* Low, low prices
that just won't stop *

13:10.190 --> 13:12.993
* Howdy's, Howdy's *

13:13.060 --> 13:14.327
* Butcher shop *

13:14.394 --> 13:15.762
* And bakery *

13:15.829 --> 13:18.031
* T-bone steak and cake for me *

13:18.098 --> 13:20.267
* Soaps and drugs *

13:20.333 --> 13:22.635
* Plus we got
yummy yum milk jugs *

13:22.702 --> 13:23.636
* Oh, baby *

13:23.703 --> 13:25.638
* Meet me at Howdy's *

13:25.705 --> 13:28.375
* Our hams won some award *

13:28.441 --> 13:29.676
* Come on now *

13:29.742 --> 13:31.144
* Meet me at Howdy's *

13:31.211 --> 13:33.013
* We have a bulletin board *

13:33.080 --> 13:34.147
* Oh, you go *

13:34.214 --> 13:36.149
* Northerly on South Street *

13:36.216 --> 13:38.585
* Come in and peek *

13:38.651 --> 13:40.220
* And you know *

13:40.287 --> 13:41.955
* Howdy's is open *

13:42.022 --> 13:46.493
* Seven days a week *

13:46.559 --> 13:49.829
* Oh, yeah. *

13:50.931 --> 13:52.365
(giggles)

13:52.432 --> 13:53.934
That commercial
was terrible.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.003
Didn't mention me once.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.404
That's not fair.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.472
You used my daughter
without my permission.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.608
Why don't you make
your own baby?

14:01.674 --> 14:03.243
Yeah. Come on, Sabrina.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.078
Let's go make our own baby.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.580
Jimmy, you said
there were no rules.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.182
I mean, and besides,
none of this matters anyway,

14:09.249 --> 14:10.650
because, you know,
obviously,

14:10.717 --> 14:12.385
you're going to send mine in,
right? I mean, come on.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.521
Everybody loves
old people and babies.

14:14.587 --> 14:15.956
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.724
Mine had...
I mean, ours,

14:17.790 --> 14:19.259
team captain,

14:19.326 --> 14:23.496
had awesome special effects
and your great acting.

14:23.563 --> 14:24.797
They both sucked.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.865
Mine had sex appeal

14:25.933 --> 14:27.901
and sex sells.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.769
How do you think I pick
my brand of shampoo?

14:29.836 --> 14:30.971
Three words.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.040
Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.574
We all know you don't
use shampoo, Frank.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.109
I am sexy.
Do you remember
the smoke effects?

14:36.176 --> 14:38.745
There's no denying
how sexy I am.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.147
Do you remember when you first
used your elf sword on me?

14:40.213 --> 14:41.781
(all arguing)
Shut up for a second!

14:41.848 --> 14:43.951
Let the world
see how good you are!

14:44.017 --> 14:46.153
(whistles)
Ow.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.388
I guess I'll just send
all three to corporate

14:48.455 --> 14:50.123
and let somebody else
make the tough decision.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.658
And shame on you for making me

14:51.724 --> 14:54.394
use my rape whistle
in a non-rape situation.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.666
Where the hell is Andrew
with the crackers?

14:59.732 --> 15:00.968
It's been seven minutes.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.470
Well, he was with Burt.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.771
He gets sidetracked.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.839
You know, like, if there's
cool stars out, or...

15:06.906 --> 15:08.175
lightning bugs.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.810
I used to get mad
at him for it,

15:10.877 --> 15:13.080
but then one night,

15:13.146 --> 15:16.216
he was outside, staring up
at the sky,

15:16.283 --> 15:19.219
at O'Brian's belt,
happy as a clam.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.421
Meanwhile,
I was getting all worked up.

15:21.488 --> 15:24.357
Ruining a perfectly good
wine cooler buzz,

15:24.424 --> 15:26.126
and I just thought to myself,

15:26.193 --> 15:28.261
"Who is the dummy here?"

15:28.328 --> 15:30.797
It was you, wasn't it?

15:30.863 --> 15:32.699
I think it's a lot of us.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.335
Who the hell are you?

15:35.402 --> 15:38.438
Maw Maw, this is
Donna, our neighbor.

15:38.505 --> 15:39.706
Is that your baby?

15:39.772 --> 15:42.142
It looks like the one that hangs
out around here sometimes.

15:42.209 --> 15:42.976
No.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.244
No. It's yours.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.413
Um, I don't...
I don't have a baby.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.948
Apparently, my husband's sperm
shares his fear of success,

15:49.016 --> 15:50.883
so we're trying to adopt.
Oh.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.052
Oh, adoption's good.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.421
Pregnancy will
ruin your figure.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.290
Oh, it killed mine.
I mean, I look fantastic now,

15:57.357 --> 16:00.693
but look how much tape it took
to keep my ass off the ground.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.229
No, Maw Maw!

16:02.295 --> 16:04.664
Oh, God.
That is a lot of tape.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.667
Oh... I can't believe
this was in your bathroom.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.502
Lucky your window was open.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.939
Okay. Crackers.
Multi-grain. Whole grain.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.107
All these damn grains.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.908
There's no water
crackers!

16:15.975 --> 16:18.078
Oh, here's some.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.180
But they don't have pepper.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.949
Burt, let's just go to Mexico.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.152
Dude, dude. It's okay.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.654
My wife is going
to teach her how to be cool.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.122
BURT (on monitor):
Stop beating yourself up.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.490
It's not your fault.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.192
Donna's the one who's broken.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.994
Don't worry.
We can help you fix her.

16:35.062 --> 16:35.995
That's why we had you guys over.

16:36.063 --> 16:38.031
This wasn't just a dinner party.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.766
It's wife school.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.069
Even Virginia thinks
your wife's a bitch.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.570
Whoa.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.038
It wasn't my idea.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.206
I did not want
to do this.

16:46.273 --> 16:47.440
Yes, you did.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.042
Because you're a
meddling busybody,

16:49.109 --> 16:50.310
"stick your nose in other
people's business" snoop.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.945
Stop. I despise those people.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.714
Andrew, we're leaving.

16:56.983 --> 16:59.119
Crackers.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.753
Uh, r-remember
that Web site.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.156
Painfreetweezer.com

17:03.223 --> 17:05.225
(ripping, Maw Maw screams)

17:05.292 --> 17:07.094
I'm okay.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.730
Just taking off my tape
for the night.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.366
(groaning)

17:19.038 --> 17:20.840
(laughing)

17:20.907 --> 17:22.041
I am so glad

17:22.109 --> 17:23.810
you finally came around
to the snooping.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.178
It's like a good TV show

17:25.245 --> 17:26.446
without all the bad words
bleeped out.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.381
DONNA (on monitor):
That woman is a (bleep).

17:28.448 --> 17:29.616
(gasps)

17:29.682 --> 17:31.151
See? You're not gonna
hear that on TV.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.785
I am not snooping.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.354
I'm trying to fix this mess

17:34.421 --> 17:35.688
before she tells the
whole neighborhood

17:35.755 --> 17:37.023
I'm a busybody.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.891
I dropped off a basket of
muffins as a peace offering.

17:38.958 --> 17:42.495
There is no problem that
a muffin cannot solve,

17:42.562 --> 17:44.597
from neighborhood conflict
to constipation.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.033
No, no, no. No good.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.368
Why not?

17:48.435 --> 17:49.469
I went over there
this morning to apologize.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.571
Andrew said her hating you
is great.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.607
Donna's so mad at Virginia,
all the heat is off me.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.210
Last night, I got to
watch SportsCenter

17:57.277 --> 17:58.578
for the first
time in years.

17:58.645 --> 17:59.912
Did you know there's
a basketball team

17:59.979 --> 18:01.581
in Oklahoma City now?

18:01.648 --> 18:03.216
They're happy.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.717
We got to get those muffins back

18:04.784 --> 18:06.486
before she stops hating you
and it ruins everything.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.388
DONNA:
Oh, what is this?

18:08.455 --> 18:11.658
Andrew, did you see we had
muffins on the porch?

18:11.724 --> 18:13.893
Ah crap! Too late!

18:13.960 --> 18:16.095
Oh, there's a card.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.930
"Dear Crazy Dragon Lady..."

18:17.997 --> 18:19.366
I didn't write that.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.334
"Here are some
banana nut muffins

18:21.401 --> 18:23.170
"because you're bananas

18:23.236 --> 18:24.771
and you drive me nuts."

18:24.837 --> 18:25.838
(chuckles)

18:25.905 --> 18:26.973
"Love, Virginia."

18:27.039 --> 18:27.840
What?

18:27.907 --> 18:29.309
Crafty devil.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.444
He must have changed the card.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.913
BURT (on monitor)
Virginia, please come back.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.415
Don't go over there.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.784
ANDREW (over monitor):
Whoa. I don't know

18:37.850 --> 18:39.018
where she gets the nerve.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.086
She's atrocious.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.989
I don't even like the muffins.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.691
BURT:
Come back.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.426
They're better off as long
as they think you're a snoop.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.795
DONNA:
Oh, my God,
it came, it came, it came.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.330
It's the letter from
the adoption agency.

18:50.397 --> 18:51.364
ANDREW:
Open it, open it.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.366
DONNA:
We're approved.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.202
We're getting a baby!
We're getting a baby!

18:55.268 --> 18:57.437
BURT:
Who cares if the neighbors
think you're nosy?

18:57.504 --> 18:59.572
I think you're
the coolest chick I've ever met,

18:59.639 --> 19:00.973
and I know deep down
in your heart,

19:01.040 --> 19:02.175
you'd do anything
to help other people.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.177
Even if it means being known

19:04.244 --> 19:05.478
as the neighborhood busybody.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.380
We're gonna be parents.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.249
Our baby's gonna have
such a happy home!
I know!

19:09.316 --> 19:12.585
( monitor squeaks )

19:24.231 --> 19:26.766
Your relaxation candles
smell like ass!

19:26.833 --> 19:30.270
And, um, your husband looks
like a skinny version

19:30.337 --> 19:31.504
of that fat guy from Mallrats.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.710
Okay, okay.
Quiet down, everybody.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.479
They said the commercial
the store owners picked

19:39.546 --> 19:41.381
is gonna run right after
the city council votes

19:41.448 --> 19:42.549
on raising the
amount of chromium

19:42.615 --> 19:43.783
allowed in our
drinking water.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.855
Just pass it already.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.690
Oh, here it is.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.459
* *

19:52.525 --> 19:54.327
Howdy's.
(all groaning)

19:54.394 --> 19:56.028
Now selling two kinds of apples.

19:56.095 --> 19:58.431
You spoke, and we listened.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.200
They picked Howdy's
West again?

20:01.268 --> 20:03.270
So lame.
They wonder why people

20:03.336 --> 20:05.672
riot in Tunisia--
look no more.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.374
It's okay, team.
We-We can try again next year.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.577
Or maybe we can beat them
at something else.

20:10.643 --> 20:11.644
Like what?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.680
Well, I don't know.
Let's brainstorm again.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.048
How about the amount
of medicine we take?

20:16.115 --> 20:17.617
Yes. But not that.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.852
Again, let's think more
inside the box.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.254
How about sales?

20:21.321 --> 20:22.221
(laughing)

20:22.289 --> 20:23.323
Yeah.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.457
If we really work together,

20:24.524 --> 20:25.858
get your sales numbers up,

20:25.925 --> 20:27.494
there will be no denying
which store's better.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.561
That's the spirit, team.

20:28.628 --> 20:29.796
You guys, go get 'em.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.764
Sell, sell, sell.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.703
(phone rings)

20:38.805 --> 20:40.773
Howdy's East.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.109
Don't you mean "Howdy's Least"?

20:43.175 --> 20:44.411
(laughing)

20:44.477 --> 20:45.845
Hello, Lamar.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.113
So, did I hear right?

20:47.179 --> 20:49.982
This year, you were
too afraid to submit an entry?

20:50.049 --> 20:51.318
Afraid? Yes.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.553
BARNEY:
But not of you.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.522
Afraid the competition
was ripping my team apart.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.490
For some of us, the real glory

20:57.557 --> 20:59.926
isn't about
personal achievement.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.694
It's about the unity
of the team.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.730
That's just loser talk, loser.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.265
I'd rather be that loser
than a cold-hearted weasel turd

21:06.333 --> 21:08.134
whose employees hate him,
like you.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.603
See you Saturday at mini-golf?

21:10.670 --> 21:13.272
Wouldn't miss it.

21:13.340 --> 21:16.343
When I say "Howdy's,"
you say "East."

21:16.409 --> 21:17.510
Howdy's!

21:17.577 --> 21:18.745
ALL:
East!

21:27.920 --> 21:30.457
Nosy bitch.

21:35.695 --> 21:38.731
Thanks for watching.
