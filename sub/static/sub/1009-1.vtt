03:32.255 --> 03:33.909
-You want a dance?
- No, thank you.

03:37.521 --> 03:39.219
Hello. How you doing?

03:41.308 --> 03:42.439
Back off, bitch.

03:46.182 --> 03:49.011
So, minus 40% is $287.

03:49.185 --> 03:50.230
Minus $160.

03:50.404 --> 03:51.883
You said it was $130.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.624
Well, you got here after five,
didn't you?

04:00.892 --> 04:01.893
Bye, new girl.

04:23.785 --> 04:25.308
Oh, my God. That couple
that I was dancing for,

04:25.482 --> 04:27.745
they were generous,
but his breath was, like, hot.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.446
Hey there, sexy,
how you doing?

04:35.275 --> 04:37.277
Figure she loses a husband,
she's gotta get surgery--

04:37.451 --> 04:39.540
She got hit by a stick.
Does that count as surgery?

04:39.714 --> 04:41.542
She looks like she was
sucking on a lemon.

04:58.210 --> 04:59.951
All right, Grandma.
I gotta go.

05:00.430 --> 05:01.910
Did you get something to eat?

05:02.084 --> 05:03.955
I'm gonna eat
at the diner, okay?

05:04.608 --> 05:06.218
What happened
to your necklace?

05:07.002 --> 05:08.395

08:26.941 --> 08:27.985

08:44.131 --> 08:47.004
So, is Justice,
like, really a model?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.008
Yeah, she'd like to think so.

08:52.836 --> 08:56.623
I mean, some of the girls
have been in, like,
Playboy, Hustler.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.756
I was a centerfold once.

09:00.191 --> 09:01.192
No way.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.412
'93.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.327
-No fucking way.
-Mm-hmm.

09:05.501 --> 09:06.546
Oh, my God.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.940
Back when Stevie Wonder
came in.

09:10.724 --> 09:13.030
What the fuck did Stevie
Wonder come to the club for?

09:15.076 --> 09:16.773
Casey had him
in the Champagne Room.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.296
Swears to God he isn't blind.

09:18.470 --> 09:19.646
Wow.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.304
How come you're so good?

09:27.479 --> 09:30.047
I see you with
every single kinda guy, and...

09:31.179 --> 09:33.616
I don't know, it's like you
have 'em all figured out.

09:34.008 --> 09:36.010
I guess
I'm just a people person.

09:37.359 --> 09:41.668
You know? It's easier
if you think of them as, like,
your rich friends, you know?

09:42.233 --> 09:43.670
Some of them are not so bad.

09:45.628 --> 09:46.890
Where else you dance?

09:47.282 --> 09:49.110
I was at Sin City...

09:49.284 --> 09:51.503
-for way too long.
-Mmm.

09:51.895 --> 09:55.812
Then I heard some boiler room
guys saying how all the money
was in the city, so...

09:56.334 --> 09:57.858
So, you followed
the green brick road?

09:58.380 --> 10:00.338
-Yup.
-So far so good?

10:01.383 --> 10:02.471
I mean, it's okay.

10:02.645 --> 10:03.690
Get out.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.779
I mean,
you must be cleaning up.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.302
You're new.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.217
You're fucking gorgeous.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.610
You're Asian.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.003
It's like a triple threat.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.745
But I'm not that good.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.008
I mean, if I...

10:19.488 --> 10:23.623
Maybe if you,
like, I don't know,
showed me moves.

10:29.063 --> 10:30.542
Maybe we could work together.

10:31.108 --> 10:32.153
You know?

10:33.328 --> 10:35.635
I could give you
a crash course in this place.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.681
Introduce you
to some of my regulars.

10:39.900 --> 10:43.207
It's just mostly
Wall Street guys looking to
spend money on pretty girls.

10:49.518 --> 10:50.867
What do you think of that?

10:53.261 --> 10:55.089
-Yeah, that would be cool.
-Mm-hmm.

10:56.046 --> 10:59.136
So, it was Ramona's idea
that you two work together?

10:59.615 --> 11:00.834
Yes, that's right.

11:02.052 --> 11:04.054
And at this point,
everything was aboveboard.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.491
I mean,
I thought she was nice.

11:08.276 --> 11:11.148
And when would you say that
things got out of control?

11:17.589 --> 11:19.243
Ramona was always in control.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.072
Front hook.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.292
Ankle hook. Yup.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.250
Knee hook.

11:26.729 --> 11:27.730
Hold on with that knee.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.166
Okay.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.168
From here,
you could do the carousel.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.301
Put your head back.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.346
Come down.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.959
You can do Peter Pan.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.439
Knee hook.

11:41.613 --> 11:42.614
Just spin.

11:43.746 --> 11:46.140
Jesus Christ.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.968
Then you can go
into a fairy sit.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.100
Oh.

11:50.927 --> 11:51.972
Stag.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.061
- That's pretty.
-Reverse stag.

11:54.235 --> 11:55.540
That's pretty too.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.759
Scissor sit.

11:59.588 --> 12:00.502
Table top.

12:00.676 --> 12:01.895
I can't do that.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.810
You can do that.
You're gonna do that.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.725
-A climb.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.599
What if you don't have muscles
to do that?

12:10.773 --> 12:12.557
-You have muscles to do this.
-I don't have any.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.255
Every girl
has muscles to do this.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.474
You could do this one,
this is a martini.

12:17.475 --> 12:19.390
Fireman down.

12:24.134 --> 12:24.831
Boom.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.616
-That's... pretty good.
-Ready?

12:27.790 --> 12:28.922
Push it, baby.

12:29.661 --> 12:30.750
You go.

12:32.055 --> 12:34.188
-There you go.
Just point your toes.
-Okay.

12:34.362 --> 12:35.493
There you go.
Hold yourself up.

12:35.667 --> 12:36.712
I'm trying.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.107
Try laying flat across.
Do a tabletop.

12:40.281 --> 12:42.718
They all love seeing that.
Makes you look strong.

12:42.892 --> 12:43.937
Okay.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.942
-There you go. Yes. Okay.
-Yeah?

12:49.116 --> 12:51.727
-This does hurt my vagina.
-Can you grab your foot?

12:52.728 --> 12:53.990
There you go.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.600
-This doesn't look sexy.
-You know what?

12:55.775 --> 12:56.993
-Thumb up your butt, almost.
-Thumb up my butt?

12:57.167 --> 12:58.299
-You know how to do that.
-How do I--

12:58.473 --> 12:59.909
-Put your head back.
-I'm gonna fall.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.606
You're not gonna fall.
Straighten your legs out.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.869
-Both of them?
-Point your toes.

13:03.043 --> 13:05.697
Yes! Yeah, point your toe.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.699
Oh, my God.

13:13.270 --> 13:15.446
We gotta get you outta
those training pumps
into a good shoe.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.318
I know.
It's hard for me to balance.

13:17.492 --> 13:20.234
No. It's easier in these.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.758
Hey, you know Diamond
from the Bronx, right?

13:22.932 --> 13:25.587
What's up,
baby-boogie-down-
fucking-Bronx-bitch?

13:26.893 --> 13:28.720
Come on, she's gonna help you.

13:28.895 --> 13:29.852
-You're gonna help me?
-You're gonna help us out
right now.

13:30.026 --> 13:30.810
-Get in the chair.
-Okay.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.333
Get in the chair.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.770
You're gonna help her learn
how to do a real dance.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.903
-Oh, my gosh.
-Okay. I'm good with that.

13:37.077 --> 13:39.122
-Okay.
-Come on. Show me
what the fuck you got.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.170
There, that's good.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.476
I really just go like that.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.783
- No, wait. Wait.
-Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

13:47.957 --> 13:49.916
I'm trying to grind his dick.
-Arch your back more.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.266
Oh, my. Move your hair,
look at me or something.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.008
-Push your butt out.
-No. I know I'm hopeless.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.487
No, look, that's it.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.707
You don't have to be
the best dancer.

13:58.881 --> 14:02.232
You just have to
make their eyes move
just one inch. Come here.

14:02.406 --> 14:03.538
-What do you mean?
-Let me tell you something.

14:03.712 --> 14:04.539
- Show her.
- Okay.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.106
Watch and learn.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.847
-You fucking sit there.
-Sit, ma. Come on.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.719
You drain the clock and not
the motherfucking cock,

14:10.893 --> 14:12.112
you know what I'm saying?

14:12.286 --> 14:13.853
And you just go slow.
Right there.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.202
-Slow.
-And you look at them.

14:15.376 --> 14:16.551
-Super slow.
- Uh-huh.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.292
-Slower.
-A little slower.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.033
-Slower.
-Sexier.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.599
-Yes.
-And look back at it.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.081
Oh, yeah. They love that.
The slower the better.

14:25.255 --> 14:26.648
Like a motherfucking sloth.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.171
-That's $20 right there.
-Slow.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.130
Remember, drain the clock,
not the cock.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.001
-Drain the clock,
not the cock.
- That's it.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.786
Come on, now you look
like you're taking a shit.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.835
You can't deny she got it.
We gonna make
some money tonight.

14:40.009 --> 14:41.663
-Come on, let's go.
-Let's go.

14:41.837 --> 14:43.447
I said: "Are we gonna make
some fucking money tonight?"

14:43.621 --> 14:45.188
Yeah!

14:46.798 --> 14:47.930
Tracey, have you met Destiny?

14:48.104 --> 14:49.410
No. Hey.
You're from Queens, right?

14:49.584 --> 14:50.890
Yeah, Kew Gardens.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.543
-Okay, I'm from Briarwood.
-Cool. Yeah.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.197
Yeah.

14:54.371 --> 14:55.242
-And this is Star.

14:55.416 --> 14:56.330
Hi.

14:56.504 --> 14:57.897
And you've gotta meet Liz.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.116
Liz. Liz!

15:00.290 --> 15:01.988
She playin' a song
for Jackie's new titties.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.425
-They're double-Ds!
-Jackie got new titties?

15:04.599 --> 15:06.470
Yeah! New titties!

15:06.644 --> 15:09.343
-It's this new
gummy-bear technology.
-Yes! Who did these?

15:09.517 --> 15:10.735
-Dr. Bobby.
-These are good.

15:10.910 --> 15:11.823
Isn't he amazing?

15:11.998 --> 15:13.390
Thank God for Dr. Bobby.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.567
And this is Mercedes.
This my baby.

15:16.741 --> 15:18.656
Hi. Nice to meet you.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.049
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Destiny.

15:20.223 --> 15:21.137
Tracey.

15:21.311 --> 15:22.530
Your boyfriend's here.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.314
-What? Girl, again?
-And he's crying.

15:24.488 --> 15:25.837
Crying?

15:26.012 --> 15:27.404
-Oh, fuck.
-Yeah, hon.

15:27.578 --> 15:29.058
What? Girl, what's going on
with Rodrigo?

15:29.232 --> 15:31.060
Girl, I don't know. He's
just been so jealous lately.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.670
-"Lately"?
- Yeah.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.716
You can't let him drop
you off. You know that.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.413
I know.
But, like, you know how it is.

15:36.587 --> 15:39.112
-At first, he liked this shit.
-Of course he did.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.070
'Cause you wanna know why?

15:41.244 --> 15:43.377
These motherfuckers think that
it's so fun to date a stripper

15:43.551 --> 15:47.294
'cause it's like, "We move,
and we fuck. And we fuck
the best. It's the shit."

15:47.468 --> 15:50.427
And then,
when they realize that
we work six nights a week,

15:50.601 --> 15:53.039
last shit we wanna see
is their damn dicks.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.823
Okay!

15:54.997 --> 15:58.305
I just wanna chill on my couch
in some feetie pajamas

15:58.479 --> 16:03.092
with my nigga, ice cream,
no makeup, and for damn sure
not with these on.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.357
Wait. I just make my boyfriend
masturbate beside me.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.533
- What?
-Is that weird?

16:10.099 --> 16:11.971
Shit. I haven't had sex
in two years.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.494
-Oh, baby.
- Two years?

16:13.668 --> 16:15.713
Well, I have a boyfriend.

16:16.018 --> 16:16.888
Since when?

16:17.063 --> 16:18.064
Since now.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.112
He don't bother me.
He don't get jealous.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.767
The only time he complain
is when I don't change
the batteries, bitch.

16:28.335 --> 16:29.858
Too bad he ain't got no money.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.903
Well, bitch, I can't
have everything, can I?

16:33.514 --> 16:35.385
Hey, ladies,
who wants cake?

16:35.559 --> 16:37.779
Aww.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.259
Ma, what are you doing to us?

16:39.433 --> 16:41.087
You can't keep doing
this to us.

16:41.261 --> 16:43.698
It's a little motivation
for my babies.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.743
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Trying to make
some extra tips.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.529
-I wanna have
a tiny, tiny little sliver.
-Teeny, teeny.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.792
But only 'cause I know
you made it with love.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.881
Go crazy. Get a big piece.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.752
Everybody have a piece
of the fucking cake.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.276
Let me get my Tupperware.
-I don't want that cake.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.538
Eat it.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.194
Hey. You an investor
in this place?

17:01.368 --> 17:02.673
No.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.022
Then quit putting money
back into it.

17:04.196 --> 17:05.502
Let the guys get fucked up.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.506
First get 'em a single,
then a double, then a triple,

17:09.680 --> 17:12.074
then go back to a double,
and then a single.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.381
You want 'em drunk enough
to get their credit card,

17:14.555 --> 17:16.252
but sober enough
to sign the check.

17:17.601 --> 17:19.516
Lenny, give us a beat.

17:19.907 --> 17:20.996

17:36.707 --> 17:38.318
According to Ramona,

17:38.492 --> 17:40.233
there were three tiers
of Wall Street guys.

17:41.582 --> 17:44.498
The guys at the bottom,
they don't do anything dirty
to make money.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.630
So, most of them
don't have any.

17:46.804 --> 17:49.546
But if they do, you can
milk 'em for every penny.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.203
♪ I, I get it ♪

17:55.422 --> 17:57.815
You know, maybe they're in
a loveless marriage.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.384
Or maybe they're single
and feeling dejected.

18:02.298 --> 18:06.041
Either way,
you can string 'em along
without getting physical.

18:07.738 --> 18:10.001
Chuck here
pays for my apartment
on the Upper East Side

18:10.176 --> 18:12.047
and I've never even sniffed
his dick.

18:16.182 --> 18:19.272
The guys in the middle,
they'll get their hands
a little dirty.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.100
But they have their limits.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.451
Don't tase me, bro.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.976
They dabble in greed.
But they never cross
a certain line.

18:28.411 --> 18:30.413
Or maybe
they're not as good at it.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.981
That's why they all share
a two-bedroom in Cobble Hill.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.420
But then there's
the motherfuckers on top.

18:37.594 --> 18:38.900
You're a dickwad,
fucking pussy.

18:39.074 --> 18:42.860
CEOs, CFOs,
investment bankers,

18:43.034 --> 18:46.603
corporate raiders,
hedge funders, ax murderers.

18:46.777 --> 18:49.911
Found footage.
You like it? Take a look.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.957
Look familiar?
Too close to home, mama?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.264
Coming straight from
the crime scene into the club.

18:56.439 --> 18:58.137
But not through the front.
Oh, no.

18:58.311 --> 19:00.269
These guys, they don't wanna
be written about on page six.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.316
They come through the back.

19:03.490 --> 19:06.362
They take the private elevator
to the one room
without cameras.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.495
How you feeling today?

19:08.669 --> 19:10.627
-Oh. Feel a lot better now.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.455
- Make some money?
-Oh, yeah.

19:13.195 --> 19:17.678
And they don't leave
till they spend $10,000,
$15,000 in one night.

19:21.943 --> 19:26.861
They can be degrading,
possessive, aggressive,
violent.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.559
And they never get
in any trouble.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.736
Because everyone's willing
to cover their tracks.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.784
'Cause deep down
they all want what they got.

19:36.958 --> 19:40.701
They all wanna be on top...
where there are
no consequences.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.487

19:45.227 --> 19:48.578

20:08.424 --> 20:11.340

is figure out
who you're dealing with.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.257
And then play them
at their level.

21:05.699 --> 21:06.700
I'm gonna do that.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.055
Let me help you.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.927
I got it.

21:17.101 --> 21:18.755
Hold on. Wait. You gotta
spread it out a little bit.

21:19.321 --> 21:20.366
I did.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.150
I gotta get a bigger boot.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.283
Oh, my God. Wait.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.459
-'Kay, hold on.
-Wait, yeah, you got it.

21:26.633 --> 21:27.938
I got it!

21:28.112 --> 21:29.331
She wasn't in it
to make friends.

21:30.767 --> 21:31.812
-Yay!
- It just happened.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.999
This is fucking hot.
- It's perfect.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.567
-'Cause it's classy.
And I just wanna...
-No. I love it. It's perfect.

21:47.741 --> 21:49.264
But do you think it's too big?

21:49.438 --> 21:51.832
Are you kidding me?
A bag can never be too big.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.616
Come on, let's ring you up.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.536
What are you looking at?
Ring it up.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.408
Thank you.

22:02.582 --> 22:03.887
There you go, baby.

22:13.201 --> 22:14.202
Okay.

22:17.292 --> 22:20.251
Ta-da! I'm designing
my own swim-line.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.689
-You made these?
-Uh-huh.

22:23.559 --> 22:24.908
I like to use
a lot of mixed media.

22:25.082 --> 22:27.258
So I, like,
find leather pieces,

22:27.433 --> 22:30.261
and then I get little chains
and make belts out of them.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.786
And this right here,
these are epaulets.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.918
That's French for
"little shoulders."

22:35.092 --> 22:36.964
You know,
a lot of people are afraid
to wear denim in the ocean,

22:37.138 --> 22:40.271
but I swear that
these get more comfortable
when they're wet.

22:40.446 --> 22:41.795
Specifically salt water.

22:41.969 --> 22:43.623
Here. Try these on.

22:46.626 --> 22:49.890
It's gonna take some time
for me to save up the money
for my label,

22:50.064 --> 22:53.067
but I do have a client
who's a graphic designer,

22:53.241 --> 22:54.677
and he mocked-up
this logo for me.

22:56.592 --> 22:57.680
"Swimona."

22:58.681 --> 22:59.813
It's catchy, right?

22:59.987 --> 23:01.423
Did you go to school for this?

23:01.597 --> 23:03.077
Yep. Thirteen credits
away from graduating.

23:03.251 --> 23:05.384
Oh, my God.
Those look amazing on you.

23:05.558 --> 23:06.776
-Yeah.
-So hot.

23:08.038 --> 23:09.475
Bear Cub, is that you?

23:09.997 --> 23:11.041
Mom?

23:11.215 --> 23:12.521
-Oh, yes.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.567
Hi, my gorgeous girl.

23:14.741 --> 23:17.004
Hi. How's my little genius?

23:17.178 --> 23:19.310
How's that big,
beautiful brain of yours?

23:20.790 --> 23:24.141
Juliet, this is
Mommy's friend, Dorothy.
Say hi.

23:24.315 --> 23:25.795
Hi.

23:25.969 --> 23:26.883
-Oh, yeah.
She's always so shy...
-Hi.

23:27.057 --> 23:28.407
...unless it's a cute boy.

23:28.581 --> 23:29.973
I'll take it from here,
Manuela.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.193
Ay, gracias, señora.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.630
Goodbye, Juju.
Te quiero mucho.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.503
What do you want
for dinner, baby?

23:38.155 --> 23:40.375
I don't wanna be dependent
on anybody.

23:40.897 --> 23:41.898
Like, ever.

23:42.638 --> 23:43.770
You know?

23:45.728 --> 23:48.383
I just wanna be able
to take care of my grandma
for the rest of her life.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.560
Maybe go shopping
every once in a while.

23:51.734 --> 23:54.694
Yeah. That's how I feel.

23:54.868 --> 23:57.827
I just want my daughter
to be able to do
whatever she wants, you know?

23:58.001 --> 24:00.700
Go to whatever school
she wants, or not.

24:02.266 --> 24:03.920
If that's what she wants.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.010
I swear,
I'd do anything for this kid.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.361
Motherhood is
a mental illness.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.670
Well, that would explain
my mother.

24:17.760 --> 24:18.761
Hmm.

24:25.202 --> 24:27.161
Is that how
you would describe her?

24:28.641 --> 24:29.685
My mother?

24:29.859 --> 24:31.078
I mean Ramona.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.781
How much of this
is going into the article?

24:39.695 --> 24:42.481
-Oh, I...
-It's just, I really hope

24:42.655 --> 24:46.615
it's not some story
about all strippers
being thieves or whatever.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.530
-Not at all.
-'Cause they're not.

24:48.704 --> 24:50.880
And it's things like this
that add to a stigma,

24:51.054 --> 24:52.969
and I don't wanna
perpetuate anything.

24:53.143 --> 24:55.189
-Of course.
-You gotta understand.

24:55.363 --> 24:56.973
I was making
an honest living then.

24:57.147 --> 24:58.366
Everything was good.

24:59.019 --> 25:01.412
Everybody was happy.
Everybody was making money.

25:02.892 --> 25:04.720
-Beautiful couch.
-I know.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.592
-That's your window.
- I got
my own place in the city.

25:06.766 --> 25:09.464
That's your floor.
Your living room.
That's your floor.

25:09.638 --> 25:11.901
Yes. And, of course...

25:12.467 --> 25:13.512
my vagina.

25:15.731 --> 25:17.211
I helped my grandma
get out of debt.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.956
And Ramona inspired me
to go back to school.

25:23.130 --> 25:24.000
Wow!

25:25.654 --> 25:29.049
I'm sorry.
It's just your penmanship
is really remarkable.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.268
I'm Stephen.

25:31.442 --> 25:32.792
You know, I just got
a vest just like that.

25:32.966 --> 25:34.576
-Do you?
-Yeah. I think
it's really chic.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.361
I'm really blown away
by your penmanship.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.320
Seriously.
You could be a font.

25:39.494 --> 25:40.713
Thanks.

25:40.887 --> 25:42.366
Did you know
that they do that?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.238
-No.
-They do.

25:44.412 --> 25:49.460
They take your handwriting
and they make it into a font.

25:50.113 --> 25:55.336
And then put it into
your computer so you can type
with your own handwriting.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.120
But I don't have a computer.

25:57.904 --> 26:00.559
-Oh! Right.
-I know.

26:02.604 --> 26:05.128
I mean, I guess that's why
my handwriting's
so good, right?

26:07.914 --> 26:10.873
Right. Right. Yes.

26:18.011 --> 26:20.100
2007 was the fucking best.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.191
Sup, bro? You good?

26:27.411 --> 26:28.674
Yo. Come here.

26:30.545 --> 26:31.938
Hey.

26:32.112 --> 26:33.330
What's going on?
What's your name?

26:34.027 --> 26:35.463
I'm Destiny.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.552
-Destiny, I'm Johnny. Sup?
-Nice to meet you.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.032
It's nice to meet you.

26:40.424 --> 26:42.426
Fucking unbelievable.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.037
-Where'd that necklace
come from?
-Do you fucking hear yourself?

26:44.211 --> 26:45.125
Hey! Come here.

26:45.299 --> 26:46.779
Welcome to my family.

26:48.258 --> 26:49.520
I'm Kim Kardashian.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.871
The princess
is in the building!

26:52.872 --> 26:56.745
I made more money that year
than a goddamn brain surgeon.

26:57.790 --> 27:01.837
And, sure, some days sucked.
Like any other job.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.057
But other days...

27:05.711 --> 27:06.842
What do you think?

27:09.366 --> 27:10.629
If I could fuck a car...

27:11.847 --> 27:14.067
-I'd fuck this car.
-This is fucking it.

27:14.241 --> 27:15.634
This is fucking it.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.592
-Stick with me, baby.
-Yeah, let's do it.

27:17.766 --> 27:19.333
-What? Yes!

27:19.507 --> 27:20.900
Oh, shit.

27:21.074 --> 27:23.119
That's my motherfucking song
right there.

27:25.034 --> 27:27.036
- Girl.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.431

Usher, baby.

30:13.202 --> 30:18.425
And for one
last moment... everything
was so glamorous and cool.

30:23.865 --> 30:26.825
We begin our coverage tonight
of what's been called

30:26.999 --> 30:30.176
"the worst financial crisis
in modern times."

30:30.350 --> 30:34.658
Certainly,
the largest financial disaster
in decades in this country,

30:34.833 --> 30:37.923
and, perhaps,
the end of an era
in American business.

30:38.097 --> 30:42.275
Some of the biggest names
in American business
are, tonight, gone,

30:42.449 --> 30:44.625
along with a lot of money
and a lot of jobs.

30:44.799 --> 30:46.975
The crash put
everybody out of business.

30:47.628 --> 30:49.021
But I had other things
on my mind.

30:49.195 --> 30:51.197
How am I gonna make money?

30:51.371 --> 30:54.156
...lost 504 points
on the day's trading.

30:54.896 --> 30:55.854
I'll take care of you.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.334
Des, look at me. Look at me.

30:59.074 --> 31:00.119
I promise.

31:00.771 --> 31:01.903
I'll take care of you.

31:04.514 --> 31:06.386
If he's a boy,
we'll name him Johnny.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.171
I hope it's a boy.

31:15.134 --> 31:18.702
After I stopped working,
I lost touch with Ramona.

31:21.183 --> 31:22.924
That's just what happens
when you have a kid.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.710
-Get out!
-Stick to it this time then.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.148
-Stick to it this time.
-I will!
Get the fuck away from me.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.976
-Go. Leave. We don't need you.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.586
-Remember you said this.
-Get the fuck out.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.240
It's what you wanted.
This is what you wanted.

31:34.414 --> 31:35.894
I don't give a shit!

31:36.068 --> 31:37.417
This is the last fucking time
I'm doing this.

31:41.943 --> 31:44.554
Hi, baby. It's okay. Shh.

31:47.731 --> 31:48.819
Shh.

31:59.091 --> 32:00.353
Hello?

32:00.527 --> 32:03.095
Hey, Stephen. It's Destiny.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.708
D-- Destiny. Wh-- Uh...

32:08.839 --> 32:10.624
-Wow.
-Yeah.

32:10.798 --> 32:12.713
Time flies, right?

32:14.062 --> 32:15.890
Uh--
Where are you?

32:16.456 --> 32:19.024
Well, you know,
I just got back to the city.

32:19.198 --> 32:21.896
Um, I moved to Arizona
a few years ago.

32:22.070 --> 32:25.204
-But I've missed the seasons.
-I'm just gonna take this
downstairs.

32:26.205 --> 32:27.641
And I really missed you.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.079
Are you still there?

32:31.471 --> 32:33.038
Yes, uh, I'm still here.

32:33.212 --> 32:35.214
Um, I'm ju--

32:36.041 --> 32:37.085
Do you, uh...

32:37.259 --> 32:38.869
Do you need to get that?

32:39.261 --> 32:40.306
What?

32:40.784 --> 32:42.308
Do you need to help the baby?

32:43.918 --> 32:45.789
No, that's my friend's baby.
I'm just watching it.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.617
Listen, I really didn't mean
to bother you.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.576
I mean, if you're not happy
to hear from me,

32:49.750 --> 32:52.187
-I can call somebody else.
-No, no. I'm happy.

32:52.361 --> 32:55.451
I just wish that you
had called sooner.

32:56.539 --> 32:57.714
Fatima came back.

32:58.889 --> 32:59.978
Who?

33:00.500 --> 33:01.762
My fiancée.

33:01.936 --> 33:04.112
I mean...  my wife.

33:05.896 --> 33:07.420
My fiancée became my wife.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.248
Right. Yeah.
I know, that's how it happens.

33:09.422 --> 33:10.858
-Okay. Bye, Stephen.
-If you--

33:24.611 --> 33:26.917
So, your last job was in 2008?

33:27.092 --> 33:29.790
Yes. But it's not like I was--

33:30.399 --> 33:31.661
I mean, I had a baby.

33:31.835 --> 33:33.533
So, I was busy doing that.

33:35.274 --> 33:36.840
A year of waitressing.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.365
Did you graduate high school?

33:39.930 --> 33:42.542
Oh, I see here
you got your GED.

33:44.587 --> 33:47.460
Five years
at Sin City Cabaret.

33:48.591 --> 33:51.159
-What did you
do there, exactly?
-Bartending, mostly.

33:53.248 --> 33:54.771
And what about at Moves?

33:54.945 --> 33:56.077
Bartending, mostly.

33:57.948 --> 34:00.081
So you really don't have
any retail experience.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.822
No, not yet.

34:01.996 --> 34:04.042
But that's why I'd really like
to get retail experience

34:04.216 --> 34:05.565
because then I would have it.

34:06.957 --> 34:09.873
We're really looking
for someone
with retail experience.

34:12.876 --> 34:15.531
Well, how am I supposed
to get retail experience
without retail experience?

34:15.705 --> 34:17.925
I mean, I sold beer.
What's the difference?

34:25.150 --> 34:27.326
Baby, come here.

34:28.152 --> 34:29.328
Did Nana fall asleep?

34:30.197 --> 34:31.417
There we go.

34:32.505 --> 34:33.505
Are you okay?

34:56.224 --> 34:57.269
You're in my seat.

34:57.921 --> 34:58.922
I'm so sorry.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.235
You're so pretty.

35:22.642 --> 35:23.730
Another Red Bull?

35:24.948 --> 35:26.036
Mom!

35:26.341 --> 35:29.257
Hey! Welcome back, sweetie.

35:29.431 --> 35:30.954
-They have you up front now?
-Yup.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.652
What the hell happened
to this place?

35:32.826 --> 35:34.132
2008 happened.

35:34.306 --> 35:35.829
The guys
don't wanna spend money.

35:36.003 --> 35:37.831
The girls
don't wanna share tips.

35:38.005 --> 35:40.529
Management has
taken the cameras
out of the Champagne Room.

35:40.703 --> 35:43.228
And I'm up front
in customer service.

35:43.793 --> 35:45.230
Yes, I see you. Hello.

35:45.404 --> 35:46.405
Another Red Bull?

35:47.275 --> 35:48.581
Who are these girls?

35:49.016 --> 35:50.278
Russians, mostly.

35:51.323 --> 35:52.324
They look like models.

35:52.498 --> 35:55.327
They're giving blow jobs
for $300 a pop.

36:20.395 --> 36:22.745
Yeah? What else you got?

36:26.053 --> 36:28.142
Come on. Don't be a tease.
Are you a tease?

36:28.969 --> 36:30.362
Feel how hard you make me.

36:33.060 --> 36:34.322
We're not supposed to do that.

36:34.496 --> 36:35.889
Oh, come on. Just stroke it.

36:37.630 --> 36:38.848
I'll give you $100.

36:40.023 --> 36:42.330
A hundred. One hundred.

36:43.288 --> 36:44.332
Please.

36:46.378 --> 36:47.422
Here.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.337
Three hundred.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.078
Pretty please.

36:51.818 --> 36:52.949
Just for a minute. Come on.

36:53.559 --> 36:55.952
Hey. We'll make
each other feel good.

37:09.792 --> 37:10.793
All right.

37:16.234 --> 37:20.847
When I got off the floor,
I saw that he gave me
three 20s.

37:30.552 --> 37:31.988
You don't have to believe me.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.514
I'm used to people
not believing me.

37:36.906 --> 37:41.998
I just wanted to tell you
so that you know where
my head was at when I saw her.

38:02.976 --> 38:03.977
Whoa.

38:09.809 --> 38:11.463
- Oh, my God.
-There's no way.

38:12.246 --> 38:14.596
Oh, my God,
she's fucking gorgeous.

38:15.728 --> 38:17.077
Of course.

38:17.251 --> 38:18.296
How old is she now?

38:18.818 --> 38:19.862
Two and a half.

38:21.734 --> 38:23.126
There's nothing like it,
is there?

38:25.390 --> 38:26.956
Juliet still lets me sleep
in her bed.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.958
But I just know she's gonna
throw me out any day now.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.704
I missed you, you know that?

38:37.402 --> 38:38.533
I missed you, too.

38:42.276 --> 38:43.364
Where'd you go, baby?

38:49.762 --> 38:51.285
What happened with Johnny?

38:57.335 --> 38:58.988
Why didn't you call me?

39:00.729 --> 39:02.949
You know that you and Lily can
always stay with me and Juju.

39:03.123 --> 39:05.865
You know that.
No, don't do that. Come on.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.649
No. Don't do that thing.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.391
Don't do that.

39:12.132 --> 39:13.438
It's me.

39:15.527 --> 39:16.571
Hey.

39:18.660 --> 39:20.749
You remember
what we were like back then?

39:21.359 --> 39:23.317
-Remember?

39:23.491 --> 39:25.188
We were like
fucking hurricanes.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.973
-Weren't we?

39:31.543 --> 39:33.849
I just need to make money
right now, though, you know?

39:34.023 --> 39:36.635
I just wanna, like,
be independent.
Not need anybody.

39:36.809 --> 39:38.332
Just me and Lily. That's it.

39:39.986 --> 39:42.205
She told me
what happened after the crash.

39:44.773 --> 39:48.908
With half of Wall Street
unemployed, the club
wasn't far behind.

39:52.085 --> 39:54.392
Mercedes got Ramona
a job in fashion.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.524
I can't believe
he got arrested.

39:56.698 --> 39:58.657
What am I
supposed to do now?
I can't afford no lawyer.

39:58.831 --> 40:00.789
I can barely afford
his half of the rent.

40:01.616 --> 40:05.446
It's almost enough to make me
just call off the wedding.

40:06.229 --> 40:06.969
Well?

40:08.449 --> 40:10.538
I mean, come on, Sadie.
And you know I love Dragon.

40:10.712 --> 40:13.498
But do you really
wanna marry someone who's
probably going to prison?

40:15.238 --> 40:16.239
I don't know.

40:17.327 --> 40:19.068
Three to five
is a big commitment.

40:22.985 --> 40:24.987
-Hey, Mark.
-Hey, what's up?

40:25.161 --> 40:28.295
I was hoping you wouldn't mind
if I ducked out early
on Fridays

40:28.469 --> 40:29.731
to pick up my kid from school.

40:29.905 --> 40:31.690
She has half days
for the rest of the year.

40:32.517 --> 40:33.866
Rest of the year? No.

40:34.040 --> 40:37.173
No, no. No, the rest
of the school year.

40:44.006 --> 40:45.486
No.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.575
Well, what if I got somebody
to cover my shift?

40:47.749 --> 40:49.838
-Mercedes said
that she could probably--
-Oh, my God. Come on.

40:50.012 --> 40:52.232
Took me forever to figure out
everyone's stupid schedules.

40:52.406 --> 40:54.016
-I know, Mark. But--
-I mean, really?

40:54.190 --> 40:56.628
Please. I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't for my kid. Okay?

40:56.802 --> 40:59.413
She's going through
this difficult time at school.

40:59.587 --> 41:00.762
She's at that difficult age.

41:00.936 --> 41:01.981
Am I the father?

41:02.938 --> 41:06.289
-What?
-Am I the father?

41:08.988 --> 41:10.380
No.

41:10.555 --> 41:12.426
'Kay. Then why
should I give a shit? Right?

41:13.645 --> 41:16.430
Don't she got a babysitter
or a nanny or something?

41:17.997 --> 41:19.520
I can't afford that.

41:19.694 --> 41:21.740
Well, you know, if you
were putting in more hours

41:21.914 --> 41:23.959
instead of racing outta here
all the time...

41:24.133 --> 41:26.092
Right? More hours, more money.

41:26.266 --> 41:28.747
More money, a babysitter.
Problem solved.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.489
Craig's got two kids.

41:31.663 --> 41:33.795
You don't see him rushing home
every time someone's
got a nosebleed.

41:33.969 --> 41:36.537
He's here,
he's doing his shifts.
I can't do it.

41:38.757 --> 41:43.152
♪ Oh lover
Don't you dare slow down ♪

41:45.067 --> 41:50.420
♪ Go longer

41:51.857 --> 41:53.249

41:53.423 --> 41:55.730
Yeah.
Why don't you take a break?

41:55.904 --> 41:57.689
No offense,
we're just not feeling ya.

What's wrong, baby?

42:21.800 --> 42:23.628
There you go.

42:25.107 --> 42:28.284
Gonna have to dig this thing
out of there later,
but...

42:28.458 --> 42:29.634
Where'd you learn that?

42:30.112 --> 42:32.593
Just some old...

42:34.029 --> 42:35.553
What? Don't you have sisters?

42:41.036 --> 42:43.648
No, my brothers
don't talk to me anymore.

42:45.388 --> 42:49.697
I told my mom and dad
that I worked here, and they
kicked me out of the house.

42:58.619 --> 42:59.751
Wanna go fishing?

43:01.361 --> 43:02.884
What's fishing?

43:06.409 --> 43:08.629
Since the crash,
the club needs customers.

43:08.803 --> 43:10.588
All we gotta do
is reel 'em in.

43:12.067 --> 43:14.461
Look,
anyone can own one nice suit.

43:15.462 --> 43:19.814
You wanna look at their shoes,
their watches, briefcases...

43:21.381 --> 43:22.469
their wedding rings.

43:23.165 --> 43:24.863
Always look for
a wedding ring.

43:25.254 --> 43:27.517
Jimmy,
another Glenmorangie.

43:28.170 --> 43:30.869
Once you got 'em on the hook,
that's when we get the net.

43:31.783 --> 43:32.784
Bring out the flavor.

43:32.958 --> 43:35.351
Spencer,
these are my co-workers.

43:37.615 --> 43:38.746
What are we cheersing today?

43:38.920 --> 43:40.356
To life. Cheers. Whoo!

43:40.530 --> 43:41.880
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

43:47.929 --> 43:49.322
-Ho-ho. What do we got there?

43:49.496 --> 43:50.932
A little
Colombian marching powder?

43:51.106 --> 43:52.630
Let me show you how it's done.

43:53.239 --> 43:55.110
- There you go.

43:55.284 --> 43:56.721
You know what we should do?
We should go to a club.

43:56.895 --> 43:58.374
We should go
to the strip club.

43:58.548 --> 44:00.376
I don't know.
I don't know.

44:00.550 --> 44:02.335
-Come on.
-It's naughty.

44:02.509 --> 44:04.598
Tomorrow we'll be
at our desks at 9 a.m.,

44:04.772 --> 44:07.035
regretting the moment
that we could've gone
to a strip club together.

44:07.209 --> 44:08.733
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

44:08.907 --> 44:09.821
I'm in.

44:12.171 --> 44:13.563
Then we
steer him to the club...

44:13.738 --> 44:15.653
- Need a ride, baby?
-Oh, yes, I do.

44:17.655 --> 44:18.656
Get in.

44:21.528 --> 44:24.487
...where we've
negotiated ourselves
a percentage of his spending.

44:26.402 --> 44:28.927
And then
we run up his credit card
as far as we can push it.

44:30.755 --> 44:31.799
Easy breezy.

44:33.018 --> 44:34.106
Another round.

44:41.417 --> 44:43.942
-Yaas.
-Yaas. Yeah!

44:46.379 --> 44:47.510
No problem.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.121
There we go.

44:49.295 --> 44:50.426
- No problem.
- No problem.

44:50.600 --> 44:51.297
Okay, you got this.

44:51.863 --> 44:53.429
-Hey!
- Yeah, Spencer.

44:53.603 --> 44:55.344
Tell the nice man
where you live.

44:55.518 --> 44:56.563
New York!

44:57.259 --> 44:58.739
Little more specific, baby.

44:58.913 --> 45:00.132
Fifth Avenue.

45:00.306 --> 45:01.307
Close enough.

45:02.743 --> 45:03.788
Hey.

45:03.962 --> 45:04.745
-Bye, Spencer!
-Goodbye!

45:04.919 --> 45:06.225
-Bye!
-Bye!

45:09.576 --> 45:11.099
But like Ramona said,

45:11.273 --> 45:13.058
"Going fishing doesn't mean
you catch a marlin."

45:18.716 --> 45:20.282
And some of the guys
didn't want to party.

45:20.456 --> 45:22.154
Oh, no. No, thank you.

45:22.328 --> 45:23.895
Come on. You don't--

45:24.069 --> 45:25.418
-Are you sure? Come on.
-I'm very sure. Thank you.

45:25.592 --> 45:27.072
You don't wanna see me
after a couple of those.

45:27.246 --> 45:28.508
Oh, boy.

45:28.682 --> 45:30.031
And some of them caught on.

45:30.205 --> 45:32.294
-I can't, but this was fun.
-What? Wait.

45:36.734 --> 45:37.778
Fuck.

45:38.518 --> 45:39.867
What do we do now?

45:40.041 --> 45:41.782
I'm supposed to get Dragon
a new lawyer.

45:42.261 --> 45:43.828
But I can't
fucking afford it now.

45:47.353 --> 45:48.571
I can't move back home.

45:50.095 --> 45:51.618
I guess it's back to the pole.

45:54.142 --> 45:56.101
Sorry, Annabelle.
We'll get through it.

45:56.275 --> 45:58.320
That's when
Ramona came up with
her special recipe.

46:00.105 --> 46:01.149
Are you serious?

46:01.802 --> 46:03.630
It's barely any different
than what we're doing now.

46:03.804 --> 46:05.588
It's just a shortcut.

46:05.763 --> 46:06.938
A sure thing.

46:07.547 --> 46:09.767
-What if someone gets hurt?
-Nobody's gonna get hurt.

46:09.941 --> 46:11.899
The worst is
they'll have a bad hangover.

46:12.073 --> 46:14.032
-What if somebody
calls the cops?
- And says what?

46:14.206 --> 46:17.600
"I spent $5,000
at a strip club. Send help"?

46:17.775 --> 46:21.256
No. They won't even know
what happened until they
check their bank account.

46:21.430 --> 46:22.475
I think I'm gonna throw up.

46:23.041 --> 46:24.869
Look, we're not
the only ones doing this.

46:25.043 --> 46:27.828
How do you think the club
stayed in business post-2008?

46:29.177 --> 46:30.396
It's a side hustle.

46:31.092 --> 46:33.138
Everybody's had to
get creative, baby.

46:36.228 --> 46:37.751
I know a girl in Queens
who did it.

46:38.447 --> 46:39.361
Did she get caught?

46:39.535 --> 46:40.841
No.

46:41.015 --> 46:42.321
She sent her two kids
to college.

46:42.495 --> 46:44.192
And now she lives in Miami.
Opened up a nail salon.

46:44.366 --> 46:45.367
Exactly.

46:49.894 --> 46:50.938
What do you think?

46:53.506 --> 46:54.507
What is it?

46:55.551 --> 46:57.510
It's ketamine and MDMA.

46:57.684 --> 47:00.774
The ketamine
wipes their memory,
the MDMA makes 'em happy.

47:01.209 --> 47:02.645
How many times
have you done it?

47:02.820 --> 47:05.344
Three times.
Including tonight.

47:05.779 --> 47:06.780
Works every time.

47:07.999 --> 47:10.523
We made five grand tonight,
split three ways.

47:14.353 --> 47:15.441
Could make it four.

47:17.269 --> 47:18.357
Be like old times.

47:23.405 --> 47:27.366
Look, baby,
we gotta start thinking
like these Wall Street guys.

47:28.193 --> 47:29.759
You see what they did
to this country?

47:30.586 --> 47:32.458
They stole from everybody.

47:32.632 --> 47:34.503
Hardworking people
lost everything.

47:35.635 --> 47:37.506
And not one of
these douchebags went to jail.

47:38.116 --> 47:39.160
Not one.

47:39.813 --> 47:40.814
Is that fair?

47:42.033 --> 47:43.817
You ever think about
when they come into the club?

47:43.991 --> 47:45.079
That's stolen money.

47:45.906 --> 47:47.865
That's what's paying for
their blow jobs.

47:48.039 --> 47:50.128
The fucking firefighters'
retirement fund.

47:51.085 --> 47:52.130
Fuck these guys.

47:59.964 --> 48:01.400
Look, we can't dance forever.

48:02.749 --> 48:04.838
What are you gonna do?
Go back to minimum wage?

48:07.232 --> 48:09.103
No, baby, this game is rigged.

48:10.104 --> 48:13.238
And it does not reward people
who play by the rules.

48:13.716 --> 48:16.154
You either gotta stand in
the corner or get in the ring.

48:19.766 --> 48:21.072
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

48:21.246 --> 48:22.247
Me either.

48:23.552 --> 48:24.510
All right?

48:25.424 --> 48:26.773
They would do this anyway.

48:28.383 --> 48:29.950
We're just helping them do it.

48:31.909 --> 48:33.171
Nobody gets hurt.

48:34.737 --> 48:35.738
Nobody gets hurt.

48:37.392 --> 48:38.480
So...

48:40.308 --> 48:41.309
are you in?

48:46.706 --> 48:47.881
Well, it's getting late.

48:48.055 --> 48:50.362
Oh, it is? What a shame.

48:50.536 --> 48:52.930
So, you gotta get up
early tomorrow, or...

48:53.756 --> 48:56.194
Let's get another drink. Hmm?

48:57.978 --> 48:59.806
Hey, these are my sisters.

49:03.549 --> 49:05.159
- Hi, sweetie!
- Hi!

49:06.639 --> 49:07.553
-Hi.
-Hi, baby.

49:07.727 --> 49:08.858
-Hi.
-Ramona.

49:09.033 --> 49:10.164
-I'm Gary.
-Gary, nice to meet you.

49:10.338 --> 49:11.513
-Nice to meet you.
-Annabelle.

49:11.687 --> 49:13.211
-Hi, Annabelle.
-Isn't he so cute?

49:13.385 --> 49:14.473
Yes.

49:14.647 --> 49:16.257
-I'm Destiny.
-Hi, Destiny.

49:17.519 --> 49:18.825
Can I have three shots?

49:18.999 --> 49:20.914
You know who he looks like,
don't you?

49:21.088 --> 49:22.568
He looks like Tom Cruise.
Right?

49:22.742 --> 49:24.526
-No, no.
I'm thinking more smooth.
-Tom Cruise.

49:24.700 --> 49:26.093
- It's the hair.
-Tom Cruise?
I don't know about that.

49:26.267 --> 49:27.486
I know!

49:27.790 --> 49:28.617
- No.
- It's your smile.

49:28.791 --> 49:30.315
It is.

49:30.489 --> 49:31.490
-It's really good.
- A mini Bob Saget.

49:31.664 --> 49:32.665
-Getting more Sonny.
-Yeah!

49:32.839 --> 49:34.232
Sonny Bono?

49:34.406 --> 49:35.668
He's got
the twinkle in his eye.

49:35.842 --> 49:36.582
- I know!
-Here we go, guys.

49:36.756 --> 49:38.236
This wine yours?

49:38.410 --> 49:39.846
-Yes, that's it.
No, this is mine.
-Okay, cool.

49:40.020 --> 49:41.326
- All right, thanks.
- Shots, ladies?

49:41.500 --> 49:42.544
- Okay. Yes.
-Yes.

49:42.718 --> 49:43.893
You guys are sisters?

49:44.068 --> 49:45.504
Yeah. Same dad,
different moms.

49:45.678 --> 49:46.592
To sisters!

49:46.766 --> 49:48.376
To sisters.

49:48.550 --> 49:49.812
To sisters.

50:06.568 --> 50:07.830
Just put him here right now.

50:08.005 --> 50:09.528
He dead?

50:09.702 --> 50:12.096
-Oh, shit.
We going to jail. Damn.

50:12.270 --> 50:14.054
- Oh, my God.
-Help her.

50:14.228 --> 50:15.882
- Oh, my God.

50:16.056 --> 50:17.753
No.

50:17.927 --> 50:19.277
Did we give him too much?
-I don't know.

50:19.451 --> 50:21.931
- Gary. Gary. Baby.

50:22.106 --> 50:23.846
Gary, wake up. Wake up, Gary.

50:24.325 --> 50:26.066
-Gary.
- Oh, Gary.

50:26.240 --> 50:27.807
- Open your eyes.
-We love you, Gary.

50:27.981 --> 50:29.461
- Gary! Wake up, Gary.
-Fuck.

50:29.635 --> 50:31.028
Open your eyes, baby.

50:31.202 --> 50:32.768
-Wake up, Gary! Wake up!
- Open your eyes.

50:34.509 --> 50:35.423
There you go.

50:35.597 --> 50:36.859
What was that, Gary?

50:37.208 --> 50:39.210
-Another round, Gary?
-What are we gonna do?

50:40.124 --> 50:41.821
What do you want?
Isn't this fun?

50:42.648 --> 50:44.824
- Uh.
- That's it, baby.

50:44.998 --> 50:45.999
That's it, Gary.

50:46.173 --> 50:47.348
Come on. Yeah, Gary.

50:47.522 --> 50:49.220
That's it, baby. Get it.

50:49.394 --> 50:51.091
-There you go.
- Come on.

50:51.265 --> 50:52.179
This one right here?
There you go.

50:52.353 --> 50:54.790
-You can do it.
-Come on. Come on.

50:54.964 --> 50:56.183
What do you want, baby?

50:56.357 --> 50:57.750
Which one is it? That one?

50:58.316 --> 50:59.360
You need help?

51:00.144 --> 51:03.060
This one? That pretty
gold one right here?

51:03.234 --> 51:05.149
-That's the one?

51:07.238 --> 51:09.109
Wow. Oh, my...

51:20.990 --> 51:21.904
To Gary!

51:22.079 --> 51:23.080
Yes!

51:25.256 --> 51:29.521
The worst are the guys
who go to the bathroom
and put on a condom,

51:29.695 --> 51:33.655
and then you know
you got to grind it out.

51:33.829 --> 51:35.048
So disgusting.

51:35.222 --> 51:37.006
We don't have to go back.
Do we?

51:37.181 --> 51:39.792
-Do we have to go back?
-No, baby.
Your dancing days are over.

51:39.966 --> 51:41.489
-Yeah?
- You guys,

51:41.663 --> 51:43.839
-I can pay off
my grandma's house.
-Yeah!

51:44.013 --> 51:46.320
-I'm getting myself
a new engagement ring.
- That's so sweet.

51:46.494 --> 51:49.062
And Dragon's ass
can stay in jail
for a few more weeks.

51:49.236 --> 51:51.064
-Or a month. Or a year.

51:51.238 --> 51:52.761
-To Gary.
-To Gary!

51:52.935 --> 51:54.023
- To Gary.
-I love Gary.

51:54.198 --> 51:55.416
-God bless Gary.
-To Gary.

51:55.590 --> 51:56.548
- I love you, Gary!
-To Gary.

51:56.722 --> 51:58.376
-I love you, Gary.
-Mom?

51:59.159 --> 52:00.552
Hi, baby.

52:00.726 --> 52:02.902
Hi, what happened?
Who woke you up?

52:03.076 --> 52:05.034
Who was it?
Some crazy lady woke you up?

52:05.209 --> 52:06.253
What happened?

52:06.775 --> 52:10.170
You guys are my real sisters.

52:10.344 --> 52:12.129
-I love you like
you're my sisters.
-Yeah. Sisters.

52:12.303 --> 52:13.434
- I love you.
- I love you.

52:13.608 --> 52:14.653
Love you.

52:15.436 --> 52:17.264
-You know I love you though.
-Yes.

52:17.438 --> 52:18.352
We are a family now.

52:18.526 --> 52:19.266
Yeah.

52:19.962 --> 52:21.747
A family with money!

52:21.921 --> 52:23.792
Yeah!

52:25.229 --> 52:28.057
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna go shopping
tomorrow? Yes, we are!

52:33.411 --> 52:35.630
Hit the Electric Slide.

52:35.804 --> 52:39.025
Okay.
I know it sounds bad to say
that we were drugging people.

52:40.069 --> 52:43.116
But you gotta understand,
in our world, this was normal.

52:43.290 --> 52:46.467
I mean, half these guys
are mainlining coke
on their way to work.

52:46.641 --> 52:49.122
But we still wanted to make it
as safe as possible.

52:49.296 --> 52:51.646
So, I suggested
that we tweak the recipe.

52:52.212 --> 52:54.867
So, what do you think?
Sixty MDMA, forty ketamine?

52:57.783 --> 53:00.089
That sounds good.

53:00.264 --> 53:03.528
Do we turn the liquid
into a powder? Or do we
turn the powder into a liquid?

53:15.104 --> 53:16.497
It's hot.

53:22.111 --> 53:24.113
- Eh, eh, eh.

53:55.319 --> 53:56.711
Let's try it in the oven.

53:59.758 --> 54:01.107
Mm-hmm.

54:03.152 --> 54:04.197
Yes.

54:07.069 --> 54:08.114
How much?

54:10.508 --> 54:11.726
Just a sprinkle.

54:15.164 --> 54:17.515
You know, I'm still not sure
about strangers.

54:18.211 --> 54:20.518
Well, that's the beauty of it,
baby, they're strangers.

54:21.345 --> 54:24.826
Yeah, but I don't wanna
slip it to anybody who's not
already on something.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.394
We gotta know that
these guys like to party.

54:27.568 --> 54:28.961
And that they've got money.

54:29.440 --> 54:31.572
Enough not to care
if some of it's missing.

54:32.181 --> 54:33.835
With strangers,
it's unpredictable.

54:34.401 --> 54:35.533
No guarantees.

54:36.838 --> 54:38.536
So, we called up
some old friends.

54:42.453 --> 54:43.410
Okay.

54:43.584 --> 54:45.543
David, is that you?

54:46.326 --> 54:47.893
It's Ramona.

54:48.067 --> 54:49.590
- Get some.

54:49.764 --> 54:50.939
Well, I can send you
a picture to jog your memory.

54:51.113 --> 54:52.811
Okay, I'll send it right now.

54:53.594 --> 54:55.683
Come on.
Come on, give it to me.

54:56.336 --> 54:58.469
No. Turn around.
You know what they want.

54:58.643 --> 55:00.166
You're into that good time.
- It's a sure thing.

55:00.340 --> 55:02.081
That's good.
That's a good angle.

55:03.125 --> 55:04.910
-My baby.
-Now we wait.

55:05.563 --> 55:06.781
You killed it.

55:09.131 --> 55:10.785
-Uh--

55:11.917 --> 55:14.049
This was too fucking easy.

55:15.442 --> 55:17.009
-Hi, David.

55:17.618 --> 55:18.880
Yeah, I can bring
some of my friends.

55:21.709 --> 55:23.537
David, these are my sisters.

55:25.974 --> 55:28.237
Hi.

55:28.412 --> 55:29.891
Annabelle.

55:30.065 --> 55:31.415
-David. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

55:31.589 --> 55:33.373
- David.
-David. Nice to meet you.

55:33.547 --> 55:35.070
Mercedes. Like the car.

55:35.244 --> 55:36.942
-Mercedes, how are you?

55:37.116 --> 55:38.378
-We should get some drinks.
- Ooh, yes.

55:38.552 --> 55:40.206

56:39.787 --> 56:41.615
Let me see,
let's do number four.

56:43.051 --> 56:47.708
It says,
"The brain evaluates data
collected from weather..."

56:47.882 --> 56:48.927
Mercedes.

56:49.101 --> 56:50.145
So good to see you.

56:50.319 --> 56:52.060
Dragon's gonna be okay.

57:05.117 --> 57:07.902
Maybe one of 'em
would call and complain,
but we could handle it.

57:08.381 --> 57:10.818
What are you talking about?
You had an amazing time.

57:10.992 --> 57:12.254
You were so happy.

57:12.429 --> 57:13.995
You kept tipping everybody,
remember?

57:14.169 --> 57:15.736
Ramona could always handle it.

57:16.433 --> 57:18.522
What are you gonna do?
Call the police?

57:18.696 --> 57:21.176
You really gonna tell
your wife and the police
what you did?

57:21.350 --> 57:23.657
You think that's worth
whatever amount
you're missing?

57:24.179 --> 57:26.225
No, you went out.
You had an epic night.

57:26.704 --> 57:27.835
It costs money.

57:28.270 --> 57:29.837
Why should it cost you
any more than that?

57:30.708 --> 57:31.752
Too cute.

57:32.579 --> 57:34.755
We treated it like a business.

57:34.929 --> 57:37.671
So, we'll have
Annabelle meet J.P. Morgan
and Mercedes meet Wells Fargo.

57:38.150 --> 57:40.152
Mercedes met Wells Fargo
last time.

57:40.326 --> 57:42.371
How much did we
charge last time?

57:42.546 --> 57:45.244
$5,000 on his
American Express and $2,000
on his corporate card.

57:46.506 --> 57:48.160
Does he have
any airline miles?

57:48.726 --> 57:50.205
-Let's check.
-Worth a look.

57:50.771 --> 57:52.077
We invested in ourselves.

57:52.251 --> 57:54.079
-Yes.
- Ooh.

57:54.253 --> 57:55.646
The dolls are here!

57:55.820 --> 57:57.125
Do I look expensive?

57:57.299 --> 57:59.084
You look very expensive.
And baby got back.

57:59.258 --> 58:01.042
That dress is hugging you
in all the right places.

58:01.216 --> 58:02.740
We expanded our clientele.

58:02.914 --> 58:04.524
What did you say
that you did again?

58:04.698 --> 58:05.830
I am an architect.

58:06.004 --> 58:07.788
Oh.

58:07.962 --> 58:11.879
-No wonder your hands
are so... nice.
-Strong hands.

58:12.053 --> 58:14.665
But the bigger
the bank account,
the greater the expectations.

58:14.839 --> 58:16.754
-Let's go fuck
in the bathroom.

58:16.928 --> 58:19.452
Uh, my sisters are gonna
be here in a couple minutes.

58:19.626 --> 58:21.236
Let's just wait
for them, okay?

58:21.410 --> 58:23.151
All right. Tick tock.

58:23.325 --> 58:24.762
The guys were getting
more and more aggressive,

58:24.936 --> 58:26.677
and the four of us
could only take on so much.

58:26.851 --> 58:27.765
So, that's when I said...

58:27.939 --> 58:29.331
We need to be outsourcing.

58:31.159 --> 58:32.770
Let's put an ad in Craigslist.

58:33.422 --> 58:35.076
So, we put an ad
in Craigslist.

58:39.777 --> 58:41.692
Does anybody have
any allergies?

58:42.301 --> 58:44.477
And by this, I mean
really serious allergies.

58:44.651 --> 58:47.349
Like, life-threatening
allergies. Yeah?

58:47.524 --> 58:48.960
I have asthma.

58:49.134 --> 58:50.744
- All right.
-I don't like feet.

58:50.918 --> 58:52.964
You have a foot allergy?

58:53.138 --> 58:56.576
No. I'm just saying
if a foot goes near my face,
I'll shut down.

58:56.750 --> 58:58.752
- I don't mind feet.
- Okay.

58:58.926 --> 59:02.974
Now, we're gonna work on
our fake sniffing
and our fake drinking.

59:03.365 --> 59:05.542
-Where were you?
-They had an Orange Julius.

59:05.716 --> 59:08.196
All right. That's good.
That's better with the nail.

59:08.370 --> 59:09.502
What's Coco doing here?

59:09.807 --> 59:11.286
We said no junkies
and no criminals.

59:11.460 --> 59:12.723
So?

59:12.897 --> 59:14.638
So, she's a junkie
and a criminal.

59:14.812 --> 59:16.857
-People change.
- I'm not
entirely convinced.

59:17.771 --> 59:19.947
Hon, you're not--

59:20.252 --> 59:22.820
Fine. But I promised
I'd buy her lunch.

59:24.473 --> 59:25.866
Oh!

59:26.040 --> 59:28.390
Who is this? What are you
doing at the mall?

59:28.565 --> 59:29.783
This is Mr. Bruce.

59:30.479 --> 59:32.220
Mr. Brucey!

59:32.394 --> 59:34.266
I take him everywhere with me.
I hope that's not a problem.

59:34.440 --> 59:36.485
Not at all. Not at all.

59:57.811 --> 01:00:00.292
Oh, my God! Hi!

01:00:00.466 --> 01:00:02.555
-Look at these
fucking bags, bitch.
-Let me see!

01:00:02.729 --> 01:00:04.339
-Take this bag in, bitch.
-Yes!

01:00:04.513 --> 01:00:06.472
No drinking, no drugs.

01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:08.996

can party your asses off.

01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:25.829
Six-six-one-zero.
And what's my balance?

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:30.050
I could've worked
on Wall Street.

01:02:36.535 --> 01:02:40.147
There were nights
and weekends when we brought
100 grand into the club,

01:02:40.321 --> 01:02:42.019
and everybody
got in on the action.

01:02:42.193 --> 01:02:44.935

01:02:48.373 --> 01:02:52.333
The hosts,
the managers, the DJ.
They all got their cut.

01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:05.956
Without us
making the effort
to go out and promote,

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:07.827
the club wouldn't have had
a business.

01:03:08.088 --> 01:03:10.743

01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:13.224

Look at this.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.092
Welcome to my apartment.

01:03:55.266 --> 01:03:57.921
My God! The penthouse, bitch.

01:03:58.095 --> 01:03:59.357
How crazy is this?

01:04:04.362 --> 01:04:05.885
- Oh, my God.

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:09.976
Oh, my God.

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:11.717
I'll teach you how to use it.

01:04:16.461 --> 01:04:19.899
Dorothy, what have you done?

01:04:20.465 --> 01:04:22.336
Well, you always said
you wanted real pearls.

01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:24.948
Did you go to the bottom
of the ocean for this?

01:04:25.122 --> 01:04:26.297
Yeah. Something like that.

01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:27.472
What is it?

01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:29.082
Oh, my goodness.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:32.433
Mommy, it's the one I wanted.

01:04:32.607 --> 01:04:34.827
Thank you
to your Aunt Ramona.

01:04:35.001 --> 01:04:36.742
-Thank you, Aunt Ramona.

01:04:36.916 --> 01:04:38.744
You're welcome,
my little baby girl!

01:04:38.918 --> 01:04:40.789
-Thank you.
-Of course.

01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:46.665
I got the red-bottoms. I got
the red-bottoms. Yes, girl!

01:04:46.839 --> 01:04:48.797
- Ooh.
-These are nice.

01:04:48.972 --> 01:04:50.016
Thank you.

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:51.322
You're welcome, my love.

01:04:51.496 --> 01:04:53.106
-Okay, okay.
- Right here.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.586
This one's for you.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.804
For me?

01:04:55.979 --> 01:04:57.154
Oh, yes. Here we go.

01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:58.677
Uh-huh.

01:04:58.851 --> 01:04:59.852
What do we got?

01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:04.988
Oh, my God.
It's gorgeous.

01:05:05.162 --> 01:05:06.598
-So classy.
-You like it?

01:05:06.772 --> 01:05:07.642
No.

01:05:07.816 --> 01:05:09.514
I love it! I love it.

01:05:09.688 --> 01:05:12.038
I'm gonna carry
all my other bags in it.
It's so amazing.

01:05:12.212 --> 01:05:14.040
Oh, my God. Thank you, baby.

01:05:15.607 --> 01:05:17.609
Okay.
I have something for you.

01:05:17.783 --> 01:05:20.220
-Do I get the big one?
-Yes, I chose this
just for you.

01:05:21.395 --> 01:05:22.788
-Okay.

01:05:22.962 --> 01:05:24.268
-Wow, it's heavy.
-Yeah.

01:05:26.313 --> 01:05:27.793
Okay. What do we got?

01:05:28.141 --> 01:05:29.447
- Open it up.
- It's a big one.

01:05:30.883 --> 01:05:32.145
Oh, my Lord.

01:05:35.061 --> 01:05:36.106
What was it?

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.934
-Chinchilla.
-Oh, my God.

01:05:39.892 --> 01:05:41.676
Oh, my God!

01:05:42.677 --> 01:05:43.635
Yes.

01:05:44.331 --> 01:05:45.506
You're the best.

01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:49.771
I'm so proud of you.

01:05:51.904 --> 01:05:53.993
-We don't need
anybody else, do we?
-Mm-mm.

01:05:54.167 --> 01:05:55.603
-Nobody.
-No.

01:05:55.908 --> 01:05:57.214
We're the untouchables.

01:05:57.518 --> 01:05:58.693
Like Kobe and Shaq.

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:01.174
Who gets to be Kobe?

01:06:01.348 --> 01:06:02.784
-I'm Kobe. You're Shaq.
-I'm the Kobe.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:04.961
-No. I don't wanna be Shaq.
-No.

01:06:05.135 --> 01:06:07.137
How are you Kobe
when there can only be
one Kobe? And I'm the Kobe!

01:06:07.311 --> 01:06:08.834
-Double Kobe!
-I'm the Kobe!

01:06:09.878 --> 01:06:11.315
Okay, everybody.

01:06:11.489 --> 01:06:13.056
Come on. Get on top of
each other. Get together.

01:06:13.708 --> 01:06:15.232
-Come on.

01:06:15.406 --> 01:06:17.060
Get close. Get cozy.

01:06:17.234 --> 01:06:18.800
I wanna get in the middle.
- In, in.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:22.282
Now say money!

01:06:22.456 --> 01:06:23.501
Money!

01:06:26.417 --> 01:06:29.550
And, God,
thank you for everything
that you've given us.

01:06:29.724 --> 01:06:31.248
This delicious food.

01:06:31.944 --> 01:06:34.033
-My new Louboutins.

01:06:34.207 --> 01:06:36.296
And... for this family.

01:06:37.167 --> 01:06:38.603
My sisters.

01:06:38.777 --> 01:06:40.953
We are so blessed.

01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:42.955
Amen.

01:06:43.129 --> 01:06:46.263
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:55.054
Try some of this pork, baby.

01:07:02.931 --> 01:07:04.933
I don't usually get
nervous around these types.

01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:06.674
No, you're good.

01:07:06.848 --> 01:07:08.285
No, they come
into the club all the time.

01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:10.026
But I had a crush on this guy
since I was 15.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.767
So, I was like, "Oh, my God."
And suddenly, he's there.

01:07:12.941 --> 01:07:14.639
Nan, do you know who he is?

01:07:14.813 --> 01:07:16.423
You know. You must've
seen him in Us Weekly.

01:07:16.597 --> 01:07:18.382
She knows who he is.
Nan, you know who he is.

01:07:18.556 --> 01:07:19.861
The guy from the movies.

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.341
I've seen him.

01:07:21.515 --> 01:07:23.126
He's very good-looking.

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.476
Yeah!

01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:27.173
Well, let me
tell you something: he's even
more good-looking in person.

01:07:27.347 --> 01:07:28.783
I am telling you.

01:07:28.957 --> 01:07:31.569
Anyway, so he picks me up
in this white Porsche.

01:07:31.743 --> 01:07:33.136
- No way.
- Yeah.

01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:34.963
And all he tells me
is to wear a hat.

01:07:35.138 --> 01:07:37.488
-Fucking Kentucky Derby.
-Yes! That's what I thought!

01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:39.490
-That's what it was, right?
-That's what I thought.

01:07:39.664 --> 01:07:41.187
That's what I thought.

01:07:41.361 --> 01:07:42.971
But then, all of a sudden,
we're at the airport.

01:07:43.146 --> 01:07:44.930
We're boarding
this private jet

01:07:45.104 --> 01:07:46.410
-to Monaco.
- Oh, my God.

01:07:46.584 --> 01:07:48.586
There was champagne,
lobster, a butler.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:52.285
And I just didn't
have the heart to tell him,
like, I hate flying.

01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:58.161
So, there I am in
this gorgeous marble bathroom,
10,000 feet in the air,

01:07:58.335 --> 01:07:59.684
vomiting lobster
and champagne.

01:08:01.599 --> 01:08:03.818
Sit here, baby. You know,
Annabelle can vomit on cue.

01:08:03.992 --> 01:08:06.386
-It's one of her many gifts.
-It's not intentional.

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.388
You're so good though, baby.

01:08:08.562 --> 01:08:12.000
So, thank God,
finally, this plane lands.

01:08:12.175 --> 01:08:17.093
And we proceed to have three
of the most amazing hours
I have ever had in my life.

01:08:17.267 --> 01:08:20.051
Until the paparazzi shows up,
ruins everything.

01:08:20.225 --> 01:08:21.358
And I have to say:

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:24.578
That's the end of the PG-13
version of this story.

01:08:24.752 --> 01:08:27.059
- Ooh!
-Oh, no. You gotta
give us more. Come on.

01:08:27.233 --> 01:08:28.756
Details, please. Tease, baby.

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:31.977
I once danced
with Frankie Valli.

01:08:32.282 --> 01:08:34.153
What? Nana.

01:08:34.545 --> 01:08:37.852
-Did-- Did you know this?
-No. What?

01:08:38.026 --> 01:08:39.941
It was before he got married.

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:41.682
The second time.

01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:43.380
I don't know, Nan.

01:08:43.554 --> 01:08:46.033
I don't know about that.
Are you sure?

01:08:46.339 --> 01:08:47.426
Pretty sure.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.299
You're not really sure.

01:08:49.473 --> 01:08:51.823
My God, this woman
is my spirit animal!

01:09:06.663 --> 01:09:08.796
♪ Rag doll, ooh ♪

01:09:12.886 --> 01:09:13.888
Okay, Nan.

01:09:14.975 --> 01:09:16.804
All right. Tell the truth.

01:09:16.978 --> 01:09:21.505
Frankie Valli shows up
on your doorstep
on your wedding day.

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:24.725
And he says,
"Me or your husband."

01:09:25.509 --> 01:09:26.510
What do you say?

01:09:27.772 --> 01:09:29.207
"Which car do you drive?"

01:09:30.904 --> 01:09:32.603
How have we not met sooner?

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.560
How have we not met sooner?

01:09:34.734 --> 01:09:36.301
How have we not met sooner?

01:09:36.823 --> 01:09:38.130
Oh, my God.

01:09:44.962 --> 01:09:46.791
So, getting back
to the drugging.

01:09:48.923 --> 01:09:50.621
Is that
what you're hung up on?

01:09:51.317 --> 01:09:52.404
It's hard not to be.

01:09:55.408 --> 01:09:57.193
What'd you say
your name was again?

01:09:57.758 --> 01:09:59.151
Elizabeth.

01:09:59.325 --> 01:10:01.109
And did you grow up
with money, Elizabeth?

01:10:02.285 --> 01:10:04.591
We were... comfortable.

01:10:04.765 --> 01:10:06.158
So, what did your parents do?

01:10:06.332 --> 01:10:07.246
My dad was a journalist.

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.030
My mom's a psychiatrist.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.119
And where'd you go to school?

01:10:12.382 --> 01:10:14.035
Brown. For undergrad.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.299
What would you do for $1,000?

01:10:17.169 --> 01:10:22.130
Of course, the answer is gonna
depend on what you already
have and what you need.

01:10:23.828 --> 01:10:25.264
-So, the--
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:10:25.438 --> 01:10:26.787
I don't think I should
even talk to you anymore.

01:10:29.355 --> 01:10:31.183
It's just, I don't know you.

01:10:31.357 --> 01:10:34.404
And I'm sorry, these girls are
just like my sisters, so...

01:10:35.056 --> 01:10:36.971
That's okay. I understand.

01:10:38.538 --> 01:10:40.061
Ramona said the same thing.

01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:42.977
You talked to Ramona?

01:10:43.151 --> 01:10:44.196
Yeah.

01:10:45.371 --> 01:10:46.329
When?

01:10:46.633 --> 01:10:47.591
Yesterday.

01:10:47.765 --> 01:10:48.679
Where?

01:10:48.853 --> 01:10:50.028
I went to her work.

01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:55.686
What?

01:10:57.557 --> 01:10:59.385
Oh, nothing. It's just...

01:11:00.604 --> 01:11:02.910
the idea of Ramona Vega
trying to go straight.

01:11:03.084 --> 01:11:04.216
That's like...

01:11:09.439 --> 01:11:12.180
Well, I mean, if you
talked to her, what do you
need to talk to me for?

01:11:13.443 --> 01:11:16.924
I was just hoping
that you could fill in
some of the blanks.

01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:18.796
"Blanks"?

01:11:22.147 --> 01:11:23.017
Okay.

01:11:23.714 --> 01:11:24.715
Where was I?

01:11:29.546 --> 01:11:32.723
Fucking copycats.

01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:38.424
Look, I don't think
we need 'em anymore.

01:11:38.598 --> 01:11:39.599
Need who?

01:11:40.165 --> 01:11:41.253
The club.

01:11:43.386 --> 01:11:45.518
Why should we split anything
when we can have it all?

01:11:47.781 --> 01:11:51.263
After she cut out
the club, we had to meet
our clients in hotel rooms.

01:11:51.437 --> 01:11:53.526
-Or in their homes upstate.

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.180
Annabelle's feeling
grossed-out lately.

01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:56.921
A lot of the girls
stopped showing up.

01:11:57.095 --> 01:11:59.227
And what about Mercedes?
Is she feeling "grossed-out"?

01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:02.361
We can't keep giving them
their cut if they're not
showing up for weeks on end.

01:12:04.755 --> 01:12:06.757
We need a bigger crew.
I'm gonna call Coco.

01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:08.802
No! She's a junkie.

01:12:09.107 --> 01:12:11.109
Fine.
What about Georgia?

01:12:11.283 --> 01:12:12.502
She just got out of jail.

01:12:12.676 --> 01:12:13.459
Trixie?

01:12:13.633 --> 01:12:14.852
She's still in jail.

01:12:15.026 --> 01:12:17.637
Ramona,
quit bringing home strays.

01:12:17.811 --> 01:12:20.466
We're breaking the law here.
We don't wanna work
with criminals.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.382
I didn't know
how much I love red hair until
I saw you standing there.

01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:26.080
- Oh, my God. Thank you.
-So amazing.

01:12:26.254 --> 01:12:27.430
- I wish it was natural.
-I might dye my hair.

01:12:27.604 --> 01:12:29.867
Hey, Dorothy. This is Dawn.

01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:31.434
Hi.

01:12:33.218 --> 01:12:34.959
♪ Pretty as
A midsummer's morn ♪

01:12:35.742 --> 01:12:39.006
♪ They call her Dawn ♪

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.921
As soon as I saw her, I said,

01:12:41.095 --> 01:12:44.751
"Oh, my God. You're gorgeous.
You have to join us."

01:12:44.925 --> 01:12:46.840
-And she said--
Tell 'em what you said.

01:12:47.493 --> 01:12:49.713
I said, "What is it?
Like, a cult?"

01:12:54.065 --> 01:12:57.373
It kinda is
a cult. A little bit.

01:12:57.547 --> 01:12:59.766
It's like, if we're a team,
and we're making money,

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:02.029
and we're winning games,

01:13:02.203 --> 01:13:04.815
do you suddenly
start trading players
and bringing in new people?

01:13:04.989 --> 01:13:05.903
No, right?

01:13:06.077 --> 01:13:07.731
Think I'm gonna buy these.

01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:09.341
Where the fuck is she?

01:13:09.515 --> 01:13:10.995
Relax. She's a pro.

01:13:13.476 --> 01:13:16.348
Two-four-three-seven.

01:13:17.175 --> 01:13:19.656
Two-four-three-seven.

01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:21.614
Two-four-three-seven.

01:13:22.267 --> 01:13:24.269
Two-four-three-seven.

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:27.751
Three-seven.

01:13:30.797 --> 01:13:32.625
Yeah.
We can meet at five or six.

01:13:33.234 --> 01:13:34.932
No, six is good.
Six is good.

01:13:35.323 --> 01:13:36.324
You want five?

01:13:36.847 --> 01:13:38.022
-Make a decision.
-Two-four--

01:13:38.196 --> 01:13:40.154
You've got three seconds.
One, two...

01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:42.374
Yeah,
I'm gonna fucking get these!

01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:44.985
Size 8, please, ho.

01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:48.206
Two-four-three-seven.
-Six o' clock or seven?

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.121
Two-four-three-seven.

01:13:51.339 --> 01:13:53.951
-Two-four-three-seven.
- Hurry the fuck up.

01:13:54.125 --> 01:13:56.301
- Two-four-three-seven.
-Jesus fucking Christ.
Come on!

01:13:56.997 --> 01:13:59.086
Um, two-four-three-seven.

01:13:59.826 --> 01:14:00.827
Good girl.

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:02.829
-I got you.

01:14:04.570 --> 01:14:06.006
Told you she was a pro.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.704
Dawn was no pro.

01:14:08.095 --> 01:14:10.315
She was a cokehead. A felon.

01:14:10.489 --> 01:14:13.971
-She was reckless and sloppy.
And stupid.
-With the blue tie?

01:14:14.145 --> 01:14:16.539
-She was out of control.
-I don't know.
I've never seen him.

01:14:16.713 --> 01:14:19.803
Ramona didn't care, as long as
she was making money.

01:14:19.977 --> 01:14:21.239
What's my credit limit, again?

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.284
$50,000?

01:14:25.939 --> 01:14:27.419
Let's do it for the full 50.

01:14:28.072 --> 01:14:29.682
We're never gonna
see him again.

01:14:30.074 --> 01:14:31.031
Who cares?

01:14:31.728 --> 01:14:33.599
Yes. Thank you.

01:14:33.773 --> 01:14:36.384
It wasn't long before she
burned through our regulars,

01:14:36.559 --> 01:14:38.865
which left us with
unpredictable strangers.

01:14:39.953 --> 01:14:41.651
-Where is he?
- Out back.

01:14:45.306 --> 01:14:46.786
What the fuck happened?

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.092
He said
he could dive off the roof.

01:14:48.266 --> 01:14:49.789
And I said he couldn't.

01:14:49.963 --> 01:14:51.661
Well, you were right.
Where's Georgia?

01:14:51.835 --> 01:14:53.445
She took off.

01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:55.491
Where the fuck is Ramona?
This is her client!

01:14:55.665 --> 01:14:56.970
I couldn't get in contact
with her.

01:14:58.537 --> 01:14:59.973
My God.

01:15:00.147 --> 01:15:01.235
All right. Come on.
Help me get his legs.

01:15:01.409 --> 01:15:02.628
I-- Is he dead?

01:15:02.802 --> 01:15:03.934
Not yet.

01:15:04.108 --> 01:15:05.762
We're not gonna kill him,
are we?

01:15:05.936 --> 01:15:07.328
No, we're gonna take him
to the hospital.
Come on. Help me.

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:10.288
-Okay.
-Help me get him. Lift.

01:15:10.462 --> 01:15:11.724
What the fuck?

01:15:12.943 --> 01:15:14.901
You can do it. Come on.
-No, no, no.

01:15:16.468 --> 01:15:17.469
Get the door!

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:23.475
I got him.
I got him.

01:15:23.649 --> 01:15:26.652
Okay. You gotta help me
with his torso. Come on.
Careful. Careful.

01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:28.654
-Ready?

01:15:28.828 --> 01:15:30.395
Watch his head.
Watch his head.

01:15:31.048 --> 01:15:31.875
Fuck!

01:15:35.661 --> 01:15:37.620
God, I'm sorry.

01:15:37.794 --> 01:15:40.187
Okay. Call Ramona
and don't stop calling
till you get her.

01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:42.799
-Okay.
-I'm gonna fucking kill her.

01:15:45.845 --> 01:15:46.977
Has she texted back yet?

01:15:47.412 --> 01:15:48.544
No.

01:15:48.979 --> 01:15:50.067
Can't believe her.

01:15:51.764 --> 01:15:52.939
Hey, slow down. Five-O.

01:15:59.206 --> 01:16:00.120
Oh, shit!

01:16:02.296 --> 01:16:03.820
Guys. You guys!

01:16:04.255 --> 01:16:06.039
- I'm sorry.
-Just chill.

01:16:06.213 --> 01:16:08.520
- Stay cool.
- I am.

01:16:11.349 --> 01:16:12.350
Oh, my God.

01:16:32.022 --> 01:16:33.719
-Fuck. I'm sorry.
-No, that's fine.

01:16:34.807 --> 01:16:36.287
I don't know
why that happens.

01:16:46.863 --> 01:16:48.255
Mercedes, come on. Help me.

01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:50.606
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:52.390
-Jesus Christ.

01:16:52.564 --> 01:16:54.044
-Help me get him out.
-Where are you taking him?

01:16:54.218 --> 01:16:55.523
We're gonna take him inside.

01:16:55.698 --> 01:16:56.568
I thought we was
just gonna leave him here.

01:16:56.742 --> 01:16:57.917
We can't just leave him.

01:16:58.091 --> 01:16:59.049
I'm not going inside.

01:16:59.223 --> 01:17:00.224
Mercedes, this is a business.

01:17:00.398 --> 01:17:01.442
No!

01:17:03.053 --> 01:17:04.228
Mercedes!

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:08.536
Oh, fuck!

01:17:08.711 --> 01:17:09.755
Help, please!

01:17:09.929 --> 01:17:12.018
Help! Help!

01:17:12.192 --> 01:17:13.280
-Help!
- Here they are.

01:17:13.454 --> 01:17:15.065
Please, help my husband.

01:17:16.544 --> 01:17:18.155
Help my husband!

01:17:18.329 --> 01:17:20.287
- All right--

01:17:20.897 --> 01:17:21.985
Please hurry!

01:17:26.337 --> 01:17:27.860
I'll be right back. Come on.

01:17:42.919 --> 01:17:43.876
Lily!

01:17:46.009 --> 01:17:46.836
Lily!

01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:50.448
Monica!
Are you still here?

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:52.580
Lily!

01:17:52.755 --> 01:17:53.799
Fuck.

01:18:23.568 --> 01:18:24.612
Come on.

01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:29.269
-Oh, my God.

01:18:29.574 --> 01:18:31.054
- There's Mommy.
-I'm so sorry.

01:18:31.228 --> 01:18:32.664
-Hi, baby.
- Hi!

01:18:32.838 --> 01:18:34.231
...you were stealing money.

01:18:34.405 --> 01:18:36.015
That's funny.

01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:37.669
-Hey. The babysitter
had to go home.
-Funny.

01:18:37.843 --> 01:18:39.453
But we had ourselves
a fun sleepover, didn't we?

01:18:39.627 --> 01:18:41.064
Oh, yeah? I'm so sorry.
-Yeah.

01:18:41.238 --> 01:18:42.630
Come on, Lily. Here we go.

01:18:44.981 --> 01:18:46.678
-Do you want me to take her?
-No, I got her, Amy. Thanks.

01:18:48.636 --> 01:18:50.029
Sweetie, we're almost there.

01:19:11.485 --> 01:19:14.010
Why are we walking
so fast, Mommy?

01:19:28.633 --> 01:19:30.200
-Bye, Mommy.
-Bye. Be good.

01:19:40.297 --> 01:19:42.908
So where was Ramona
when I needed her?

01:19:44.823 --> 01:19:46.129
Bailing out Dawn again.

01:19:46.694 --> 01:19:48.609
Are you kidding me?
Let me buy you lunch, baby.

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.611
- Yeah?
You're so good to me.
- Yes, of course.

01:19:59.664 --> 01:20:01.753
-Don't ever fucking
call me again. - Baby.

01:20:17.856 --> 01:20:21.512
Come Friday,
we're looking at sunny skies
with a high of 78 degrees.

01:20:22.339 --> 01:20:24.645
On the weekend,
we got scattered showers--

01:20:41.706 --> 01:20:43.577
I'm sorry
I wasn't there, baby.

01:20:53.805 --> 01:20:54.850
I know.

01:21:05.730 --> 01:21:07.079
I don't wanna go home.

01:21:09.647 --> 01:21:11.475
Do you and Lily
wanna stay with us?

01:21:13.303 --> 01:21:14.304
Yeah.

01:21:14.782 --> 01:21:15.827
Okay.

01:21:20.353 --> 01:21:24.531
You know, I'm supposed to
meet someone tonight
if you wanna join me.

01:21:25.271 --> 01:21:26.969
I mean,
take your mind off things.

01:21:29.362 --> 01:21:31.147
Ain't no pressure,
just, you know...

01:21:33.671 --> 01:21:34.846
If you need the money.

01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:39.372
Could be a big one.

01:21:41.722 --> 01:21:43.420
I knew it had to stop.

01:21:44.812 --> 01:21:47.859
I kept thinking
that there was, like,
this magic number.

01:21:49.339 --> 01:21:51.515
You know,
if I could save enough money,

01:21:51.689 --> 01:21:53.473
I could start clean.

01:21:54.605 --> 01:21:55.606
Just me and Lily.

01:21:57.521 --> 01:22:00.828
Maybe a score so big that
we would never need anybody.

01:22:01.307 --> 01:22:03.353
Is that what happened
with Doug ####?

01:22:05.616 --> 01:22:07.313
Uh...

01:22:07.487 --> 01:22:08.924
I don't really remember
a Doug ####.

01:22:09.794 --> 01:22:11.883
-Ramona said--
-Well, Ramona's a liar.

01:22:13.841 --> 01:22:16.235
She'll say anything
to make herself look better.

01:22:16.801 --> 01:22:18.585
I mean,
what did she say about me?

01:22:18.759 --> 01:22:20.283
I'm sure she had a lot to say.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.241
What'd she say?

01:22:23.112 --> 01:22:24.983
She said you had
a tough time growing up

01:22:25.157 --> 01:22:27.116
and that you spent
a lot of time alone.

01:22:28.769 --> 01:22:30.554
You got into fights and...

01:22:32.295 --> 01:22:34.514
had some bad boyfriends.

01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:37.126
Okay. What else?

01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:43.959
That your parents
were immigrants, and that
when your father left,

01:22:44.611 --> 01:22:47.179
your mother dropped you off
at your grandparents' house.

01:22:49.094 --> 01:22:50.095
And never came back.

01:22:52.271 --> 01:22:53.272
Is that true?

01:22:58.930 --> 01:23:02.194
I mean, I thought that she was
just taking a break, you know?

01:23:05.197 --> 01:23:08.635
I thought that, you know,
sometimes moms need a break.

01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:12.857
Why would she
tell you all that?

01:23:14.032 --> 01:23:17.340
I think she just wanted me
to understand that, for you,

01:23:17.514 --> 01:23:19.559
this wasn't about revenge.

01:23:21.648 --> 01:23:23.694
You were just trying
to make friends.

01:23:29.395 --> 01:23:30.527
Destiny.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:35.619
I know I'm supposed to think
that what you did was terrible

01:23:35.793 --> 01:23:37.360
and that these guys
didn't deserve it.

01:23:38.448 --> 01:23:41.625
But to tell you the truth,
I don't feel sorry for them.

01:23:42.713 --> 01:23:44.541
Well, I feel sorry for them.

01:23:49.546 --> 01:23:51.504
You know,
I keep having this nightmare.

01:23:51.678 --> 01:23:55.465
Right? Where, like, I'm in
the back seat of this car.

01:23:55.639 --> 01:23:56.683
This moving car.

01:23:57.641 --> 01:24:01.819
And I realize that nobody
is driving the car.

01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:06.954
And I have to get
to the front seat to try
to stop it, and I go there,

01:24:07.129 --> 01:24:10.610
and no matter what I do,
I can't get a grip on it.

01:24:10.784 --> 01:24:12.656
And I can't, like, stop it.

01:24:13.265 --> 01:24:16.007
And then I wake up.

01:24:19.619 --> 01:24:21.447
What happened
between you and Ramona?

01:24:23.188 --> 01:24:24.755
Why aren't you
talking anymore?

01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:15.632
Hello?

01:25:15.806 --> 01:25:18.025
So Ramona met Doug years ago.

01:25:18.939 --> 01:25:21.420
Doug's friend
took him to the club
to blow off some steam

01:25:21.594 --> 01:25:23.292
after a few
devastating events.

01:25:23.466 --> 01:25:24.858
I don't know
that it is gonna be okay.

01:25:26.338 --> 01:25:28.123
How could it get worse?

01:25:28.297 --> 01:25:31.082
Which included his house
being destroyed by a fire.

01:25:33.998 --> 01:25:36.392
And separating from
the mother of his young son.

01:25:38.524 --> 01:25:41.353
She never really wanted
to have kids, you know?

01:25:42.049 --> 01:25:45.531
So, I think when we found out
he was autistic,

01:25:45.705 --> 01:25:48.534
I think she just
couldn't handle it, you know?

01:25:49.013 --> 01:25:50.057
He was nice.

01:25:50.623 --> 01:25:53.409
We talked about our kids.
We talked about our exes.

01:25:53.931 --> 01:25:55.715
-We had a heart-to-heart.
- Drinks!

01:25:56.934 --> 01:25:59.284
Here we go.
That one's for you.

01:25:59.458 --> 01:26:00.720
- Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:26:00.894 --> 01:26:02.374
So, what happened to Doug?

01:26:04.115 --> 01:26:06.857
So, what I miss?
What are we doing tonight?

01:26:07.858 --> 01:26:09.207
Um...

01:26:09.381 --> 01:26:10.469
Uh...

01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:13.559
The room was round.

01:26:16.606 --> 01:26:18.999
There was a table.

01:26:21.611 --> 01:26:23.613
They maxed out
my corporate card...

01:26:24.614 --> 01:26:28.313
so my company launched
an internal investigation,

01:26:28.922 --> 01:26:30.489
and I was fired.

01:26:30.881 --> 01:26:33.188
Can you please just
credit back my debit card?

01:26:33.362 --> 01:26:35.233
My mortgage payment's
on there.

01:26:35.886 --> 01:26:38.236
What are you talking about?
You were having a great time.

01:26:39.803 --> 01:26:41.457
Why are you doing this to me?

01:26:41.935 --> 01:26:46.636
Please, I have nothing.
I can't--

01:26:46.810 --> 01:26:49.378
I can't afford to not pay
my mortgage.

01:26:51.684 --> 01:26:52.685
My s--

01:26:53.338 --> 01:26:54.426
My son...

01:26:56.428 --> 01:26:57.516
I'm really sorry.

01:26:58.648 --> 01:26:59.866
Put the phone down, Destiny.

01:27:03.348 --> 01:27:05.350
-Put it away.
-Just give me a second.

01:27:05.524 --> 01:27:07.004
Don't. What the--

01:27:07.178 --> 01:27:09.354
-Gimme the phone.
-Get off of me!

01:27:09.528 --> 01:27:11.356
- Hey!
-Stop!

01:27:11.530 --> 01:27:14.968
-If we don't do it,
someone else will.
-Get off of me.

01:27:15.142 --> 01:27:17.101
-Gimme that fucking phone.

01:27:20.452 --> 01:27:21.975
Ungrateful little bitch.

01:27:56.009 --> 01:27:56.923
Precinct.

01:27:57.097 --> 01:27:58.447
Yes, hello. I--

01:27:58.621 --> 01:28:00.753
I went to a strip club
and I was drugged.

01:28:09.414 --> 01:28:10.807
Precinct.

01:28:10.981 --> 01:28:12.025
I was drugged,
and I have proof.

01:28:13.897 --> 01:28:14.898
It was weird.

01:28:15.072 --> 01:28:16.291
It was real weird.

01:28:16.465 --> 01:28:18.205
If it hadn't been
for the tape,

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.207
I would've been like, "Dude,
you're fucking full of shit."

01:28:20.512 --> 01:28:22.993
Please. I just wanna know
what happened to me.

01:28:23.167 --> 01:28:25.387
- Um...

01:28:25.561 --> 01:28:27.606
You were fleeced, that's all.

01:28:27.998 --> 01:28:29.608
By who?

01:28:30.653 --> 01:28:33.264
Um...  Well,
we're, like, a little gang.

01:28:34.134 --> 01:28:35.571
You were just a target.

01:28:35.745 --> 01:28:37.573
We just gave you
a little sprinkle.

01:28:38.095 --> 01:28:39.401
I'll tell you everything.

01:28:39.575 --> 01:28:41.620
I'll tell you everything
I know, I promise.

01:28:41.794 --> 01:28:43.361
I know a lot. I really--

01:28:43.535 --> 01:28:45.668
I'll tell you everything.
I just don't wanna go back.

01:28:45.842 --> 01:28:47.278
So, was there a sting?

01:28:47.452 --> 01:28:48.497
-One, two. One, two.

01:28:48.671 --> 01:28:50.368
Hello, police.
Can you hear me?

01:28:50.542 --> 01:28:52.109
I'm about to open the door.

01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:54.807
-Hey, did you bring the drugs?
- Shh.

01:28:54.981 --> 01:28:56.679
- Where is he?
-He's in the bathroom.

01:29:00.639 --> 01:29:02.467
Look, like, I don't think
that he likes me.

01:29:02.641 --> 01:29:05.165
So, I don't know,
I think one of you
is gonna have to do it.

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:06.515
Are you high?

01:29:06.689 --> 01:29:07.429
- What?
-Give her a break.

01:29:07.603 --> 01:29:09.692
No. Me?

01:29:09.866 --> 01:29:12.347
No, no. No. No. I don't do
that kind of stuff anymore.

01:29:12.521 --> 01:29:14.087
That's just... it's not me.

01:29:15.524 --> 01:29:17.090
-Hey, hey, ladies.
- Hey.

01:29:17.264 --> 01:29:19.049
-Christmas come early.

01:29:19.223 --> 01:29:21.094
Hey, these are my friends
that I told you about.

01:29:21.268 --> 01:29:23.053
-Hi, friends.
-This is Ramona.

01:29:23.227 --> 01:29:24.924
-Ramona. Hi.
-Ramona. Hi.

01:29:25.098 --> 01:29:26.796
-This is--
-And I'm Rhonda.

01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:28.754
-Rhonda. You are
both very attractive.
-Rhonda. Yeah.

01:29:28.928 --> 01:29:30.365
Thank you.

01:29:30.539 --> 01:29:33.803
Okay. Why don't you
take a seat right here.

01:29:34.543 --> 01:29:36.501
We're gonna fix you a drink.

01:29:36.675 --> 01:29:39.069
-So, you stay there, okay?
-You get one too. Shots?
I don't know.

01:29:39.243 --> 01:29:40.244
We'll see about that.

01:29:49.688 --> 01:29:52.604
Just a second. Hmm.

01:29:52.778 --> 01:29:54.476
Hope you're thirsty.

01:30:00.133 --> 01:30:02.048
-Do it.
-No, just go ahead.

01:30:03.136 --> 01:30:04.137
Go on.

01:30:05.138 --> 01:30:06.879
You found him. Go ahead.

01:30:12.885 --> 01:30:14.234
Hi.

01:30:15.105 --> 01:30:16.106
Here you go.

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.587
Yum, yum, yummers. Slàinte.

01:30:20.545 --> 01:30:21.590
So, who's excited?

01:30:22.199 --> 01:30:24.331
I'm telling you,
it's the same fucking car.

01:30:24.506 --> 01:30:26.421
You're being paranoid.

01:30:26.595 --> 01:30:28.727
No, I saw
the same fucking Buick
parked outside the Gansevoort.

01:30:28.901 --> 01:30:31.034
It's not a Buick.

01:30:31.208 --> 01:30:33.776
Well, whatever the fuck it is,
it's been following us
for 20 minutes.

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:36.605
-Dawn was
setting us up back there.
-Dawn?

01:30:37.736 --> 01:30:39.651
Now I know you're paranoid.

01:30:39.825 --> 01:30:42.219
You really think
that she wouldn't sell you
out to save herself?

01:30:43.568 --> 01:30:45.091
So, there was a sting?

01:30:47.093 --> 01:30:49.922
We cannot comment on that
at this time.

01:30:50.096 --> 01:30:52.534
But what we can tell you

01:30:52.708 --> 01:30:55.275
is the amount of people that
were willing to talk to us
was so small it was absurd.

01:30:55.972 --> 01:30:57.887
Why?

01:30:58.061 --> 01:31:00.585
I guess men don't wanna admit
what happened to them,
you know?

01:31:00.759 --> 01:31:02.631
Being victimized by a woman.

01:31:03.632 --> 01:31:05.416
So, we did some investigating,

01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:06.809
and we found
the Connecticut architect

01:31:06.983 --> 01:31:10.029
who Moves said
failed to pay a $135,000 bill

01:31:10.203 --> 01:31:12.554
he racked up during
four visits to the club.

01:31:12.728 --> 01:31:15.339
"For a night of pleasure
he can't even remember."

01:31:16.253 --> 01:31:17.428
What a boob.

01:31:17.602 --> 01:31:19.343
"And went back
three more times"?

01:31:21.388 --> 01:31:22.607
I guess he must've liked it.

01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:26.002
You know, when you
look at it out of context,

01:31:26.176 --> 01:31:27.264
it seems like
he's making it up.

01:31:27.438 --> 01:31:29.092
You're a family girl?

01:31:29.266 --> 01:31:30.963
You look like my brother.

01:31:31.137 --> 01:31:32.051
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:31:32.225 --> 01:31:33.662
-You like that?
-No.

01:31:33.836 --> 01:31:35.838
Why I'm here. I mean,
it's not about the money.

01:31:36.012 --> 01:31:38.580
It's about the next guy
this happens to,

01:31:38.754 --> 01:31:40.973
and, like, I gotta
do something to stop that.

01:31:41.147 --> 01:31:44.411
But when you put it together
with Doug, it all added up.

01:31:44.716 --> 01:31:46.762
Peter.
Peter, these are my sisters.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:50.505
Oh, yes!

01:31:51.897 --> 01:31:52.985
Scary, isn't it?

01:31:54.813 --> 01:31:57.250
I mean, we got so spooked,
none of us went back
to the club anymore.

This is unbelievable.

01:34:53.426 --> 01:34:54.558
You guys are really something,
you know that?

01:34:54.732 --> 01:34:55.820
Does Tony know about this?

01:34:55.994 --> 01:34:57.343
Take a seat, Miss Vega.

01:34:58.170 --> 01:34:59.215
This is crazy.

01:34:59.606 --> 01:35:00.956
We didn't do anything wrong.

01:35:01.652 --> 01:35:03.959
You know,
Tony wouldn't let this happen.
I'm gonna text him.

01:35:04.133 --> 01:35:05.525
Who gave her her phone back?

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:07.876
Think about your daughter.

01:35:09.529 --> 01:35:11.444
You're facing
felony charges here.

01:35:12.445 --> 01:35:14.534
You really wanna go down
for someone else?

01:35:16.275 --> 01:35:18.930
Come on. You want Lily
to grow up without her mother?

01:35:20.018 --> 01:35:21.933
You think
these girls are your friends?

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.544
You don't think
they're gonna rat you out?

01:35:25.937 --> 01:35:27.156
Think about your daughter.

01:35:28.331 --> 01:35:30.072
Mercedes is probably gonna use
Dragon's lawyer.

01:35:30.246 --> 01:35:32.335
So, you, me and Annabelle
should probably lawyer up.

01:35:33.423 --> 01:35:36.034
Do we know any lawyers
from the club? That guy,
Jeremy? Or maybe Anton?

01:35:36.208 --> 01:35:37.296
I took the deal.

01:35:43.172 --> 01:35:44.303
You did?

01:35:51.833 --> 01:35:53.704
Have I taught you
fucking nothing?

01:35:58.796 --> 01:36:01.407
You fucking idiot!
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:36:02.495 --> 01:36:03.583
Why would you do that?

01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:05.020
For Lily.

01:36:16.814 --> 01:36:20.731
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

01:36:28.217 --> 01:36:29.784
Motherhood is
a mental illness.

01:36:43.188 --> 01:36:44.450
I'm sorry.

01:36:48.933 --> 01:36:50.805
We were fucking hurricanes,
weren't we?

01:36:50.979 --> 01:36:52.067
Yeah.

01:37:11.303 --> 01:37:13.131
- Hello?
-Hi. Um...

01:37:13.305 --> 01:37:15.003
Hi, Elizabeth. It's Destiny.

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:17.483
Hey, Destiny. How are you?

01:37:17.657 --> 01:37:19.094
I'm good. I'm really good.

01:37:19.268 --> 01:37:21.226
Lily's great. Um...

01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:24.534
Oh, I put the house
up for sale. We're
moving back to Queens.

01:37:24.708 --> 01:37:26.797
You know, I've been making
a ton of new friends.

01:37:26.971 --> 01:37:29.278
And, oh, I met this guy who--

01:37:29.452 --> 01:37:32.281
He's gonna help me get
a job in pharmaceuticals.

01:37:32.455 --> 01:37:34.109
So I'm really excited
about that.

01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:39.288
-Are you still there?
-I'm here.

01:37:39.941 --> 01:37:41.856
So, I was just reading
the article again,

01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:46.556
and maybe the reason
why we did what we did

01:37:46.730 --> 01:37:49.951
is because hurt people
hurt people, you know?

01:37:51.169 --> 01:37:53.041
Yeah. No, I understand.

01:37:57.306 --> 01:37:59.177
So, have you talked
to Ramona lately?

01:38:00.265 --> 01:38:02.224
No, just that one time.

01:38:03.921 --> 01:38:05.357
-Have you?
-No.

01:38:06.445 --> 01:38:07.794
Um...

01:38:09.666 --> 01:38:11.494
Can I just ask you...

01:38:14.279 --> 01:38:16.542
Like, what else
did she say about me?

01:38:17.152 --> 01:38:19.284
So, I used to live
in the Bronx back then.

01:38:19.458 --> 01:38:23.114
But I was seeing this guy
who had a walk-up right next
to where I stripped.

01:38:23.288 --> 01:38:25.812
So, I was staying
at his place,
like, every night.

01:38:25.987 --> 01:38:29.251
But one morning,
I go back to my place,
and the door's wide open.

01:38:29.425 --> 01:38:31.949
And I was freaked out,
you know? I was like,
"Oh, my God. All my stuff.

01:38:32.123 --> 01:38:35.822
All my valuable stuff
is in this place that
I'm not even sleeping in."

01:38:35.997 --> 01:38:38.303
So, now I just carry
everything with me
everywhere I go.

01:38:38.782 --> 01:38:39.783
Let me show you.

01:38:41.306 --> 01:38:42.307
Let's see.

01:38:43.178 --> 01:38:44.222
This.

01:38:46.007 --> 01:38:48.357
This is a patch
from my grandpa's uniform.
He was in the navy.

01:38:49.532 --> 01:38:50.837
Oh!

01:38:51.012 --> 01:38:54.145
This is my--
my grandma's wedding ring.

01:38:54.624 --> 01:38:56.931
Isn't that pretty?
And this one was my mother's.

01:38:57.105 --> 01:38:59.629
It's the three birthstones
of me and my sisters.

01:38:59.803 --> 01:39:02.414
The ruby's me.
I was a July baby.

01:39:02.719 --> 01:39:06.288
I have two sisters.
One lives in Arizona,
the other one lives in Texas.

01:39:06.462 --> 01:39:10.379
We try to get together
once a year, but with
the kids, it's impossible.

01:39:10.553 --> 01:39:11.641
Do you have kids?

01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:13.164
Not yet.

01:39:13.338 --> 01:39:14.339
Well, don't worry.
You're young.

01:39:14.513 --> 01:39:16.298
And you have amazing skin.

01:39:18.865 --> 01:39:19.997
Is that you?

01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:23.914
That's me.
I was 15.

01:39:26.177 --> 01:39:27.962
A senior
had asked me to the prom.

01:39:28.614 --> 01:39:29.964
I look terrified.

01:39:30.138 --> 01:39:31.313
I like the dress, though.

01:39:32.705 --> 01:39:35.360
And this here,
this is Dorothy.

01:39:35.882 --> 01:39:37.536
Wasn't she the cutest?

01:39:39.408 --> 01:39:40.713
Who could leave that baby?

01:39:43.542 --> 01:39:45.109
You know, we used to say,

01:39:45.414 --> 01:39:48.373
"If only we had known
each other back then."

01:39:48.547 --> 01:39:49.548
You know?

01:39:52.203 --> 01:39:56.033
Maybe we could've...
looked out for one another.

01:39:57.556 --> 01:39:59.689
Maybe our lives
would've been different.

01:40:01.082 --> 01:40:02.126
You know?

01:40:04.389 --> 01:40:06.130
Or maybe it would've
just been the same.

01:40:07.088 --> 01:40:08.132
Who knows?

01:40:09.829 --> 01:40:11.483
But I like to keep her
with me.

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:29.327
What else you wanna know?

01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:01.055
You should
give her a call, Destiny.

01:41:03.361 --> 01:41:05.189
Yeah.

01:41:43.445 --> 01:41:44.924
Look, there's nothing
I can really say

01:41:45.099 --> 01:41:47.405
to make sense
of what went down.

01:41:48.406 --> 01:41:49.712
But everybody's hustling.

01:41:51.235 --> 01:41:52.410
This city--

01:41:53.063 --> 01:41:55.979
Fuck, this whole country
is a strip club.

01:41:58.416 --> 01:42:02.420
You got people
tossing the money...
and people doing the dance.

01:42:08.774 --> 01:42:11.299
One last time, everybody,
let's hear it for our girls!

01:42:11.473 --> 01:42:12.865
- Hit it!
- Okay?

01:42:15.868 --> 01:42:17.348
Whoo!

01:42:22.788 --> 01:42:23.876
Oh!

01:42:24.964 --> 01:42:26.531
Whoo!

01:42:31.841 --> 01:42:35.149
One, two, three, four!
Go. Go. Go.

01:42:48.162 --> 01:42:49.337
That's it, folks.

01:42:50.729 --> 01:42:52.340
It was fun while it lasted.

01:42:57.475 --> 01:42:59.477
See me on your way out,

01:42:59.651 --> 01:43:02.350
I'll be selling excuses
for why there's glitter
on your pants.

01:43:10.836 --> 01:43:13.230
We got a lot of ladies
in the house tonight.

01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:16.277
Must be a bachelorette party
going on.

01:43:21.107 --> 01:43:23.197
There is no flash photography
here at Moves.

01:43:23.371 --> 01:43:26.069
In fact
no flashing of any kind.

01:43:34.251 --> 01:43:35.687
It's time to go home
gentleman.

01:43:35.861 --> 01:43:38.212
The girls are not coming
back out.

01:43:45.088 --> 01:43:48.439
On behalf of Moves, make sure
you tip your waitresses,

01:43:48.613 --> 01:43:50.354
and get home safe.

01:43:54.053 --> 01:43:55.794
Good night everybody.

01:43:56.404 --> 01:43:57.883
I'm sure I will see you again.

01:43:58.144 --> 01:43:59.363
Real soon.
