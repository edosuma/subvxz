00:22.271 --> 00:24.556
I'm looking for Dr. John Thackery.

00:24.557 --> 00:26.391
I believe he's a surgeon here.

00:26.392 --> 00:29.277
Dr. Thackery's office
is on the second floor

00:29.278 --> 00:31.596
on the west side of the...

00:32.448 --> 00:34.650
building.

00:34.651 --> 00:38.236
I'll have someone from surgical
services take you to him.

00:39.155 --> 00:41.072
Thank you.

00:57.590 --> 01:01.643
Dr. Thackery, there is a
Mrs. Alford here to see you.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.929
I'm not expecting anyone.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.231
I think she might be a patient.

01:06.232 --> 01:09.100
Then tell her to make an
appointment with Gallinger

01:09.101 --> 01:12.404
and if it merits my attention,
I'm sure he'll let me know.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.656
She says she's a friend.

01:14.657 --> 01:17.359
I assure you that my social circle

01:17.360 --> 01:21.030
is sufficiently small
that I would know anyone

01:21.031 --> 01:24.699
foolish enough to call
themselves any such thing.

01:26.369 --> 01:28.870
Should I send her away?

01:29.872 --> 01:31.739
Abby?

01:45.137 --> 01:47.355
Hello, John.

01:47.356 --> 01:50.275
Alford, I...

01:50.276 --> 01:52.060
I didn't recognize the name.

01:52.061 --> 01:54.563
Your husband's?

01:54.564 --> 01:57.900
Wherever he may be.

01:57.901 --> 02:00.852
It's good to see you.

02:05.791 --> 02:09.776
No one handles the
unexpected like John Thackery.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.615
It's where I live.

02:15.584 --> 02:18.253
Thank you, Nurse Elkins.

02:25.344 --> 02:27.795
Please, take a seat.

02:36.906 --> 02:39.691
I didn't know how else to go about this.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.995
- I thought of writing a letter first.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

02:43.996 --> 02:46.114
You're here now.

02:47.416 --> 02:49.617
In all my splendor.

02:51.787 --> 02:54.457
I suppose you can surmise
why I've come to you.

02:54.458 --> 02:56.424
Of course.

02:56.425 --> 02:58.593
Please don't be uncomfortable.

02:58.594 --> 03:00.578
This is something I'm very used to.

03:03.799 --> 03:06.468
In all the time we were together,

03:06.469 --> 03:09.637
I could never get used
to what you called normal.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.975
I suppose it's only fair as you could never

03:12.976 --> 03:16.511
get used to what everyone
else called normal.

03:17.446 --> 03:19.764
Well, Mrs. Alford...

03:21.901 --> 03:23.401
let me take a look at you

03:23.402 --> 03:26.821
and see what remedies I can offer.

03:37.833 --> 03:39.668
Wait.

03:39.669 --> 03:41.336
The light.

03:41.337 --> 03:43.788
Of course.

03:46.509 --> 03:48.510
Thank you.

03:48.511 --> 03:50.179
My eyes can't bear it.

03:50.180 --> 03:53.298
No, no. It's a common symptom.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.901
Is the light still too much?

04:15.287 --> 04:18.072
No. No.

04:30.553 --> 04:32.470
I wouldn't blame you for wondering.

04:32.471 --> 04:34.722
I'm not. Hold still.

04:34.723 --> 04:36.941
I've only been with two men in my life...

04:36.942 --> 04:39.611
you and my husband.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.396
It was my husband.

04:41.397 --> 04:44.233
What's past is past.

04:44.234 --> 04:48.070
I'd really prefer not to get into it.

04:48.071 --> 04:51.122
He didn't have it when I first met him.

04:51.123 --> 04:53.491
It happened later.

04:53.492 --> 04:57.695
With a girl in his office.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.583
You've got good capillaries on the bridge

05:01.584 --> 05:03.868
and healthy skin on the edges.

05:04.887 --> 05:07.171
Apparently she had it.

05:08.307 --> 05:12.293
You know, Abby, you owe me no explanations.

05:13.813 --> 05:17.348
Everyone out there can stare
and think what they want,

05:17.349 --> 05:19.017
but I need you to understand.

05:19.018 --> 05:21.437
Please, John.

05:21.438 --> 05:23.321
Very well.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.440
Hold still.

05:29.361 --> 05:31.947
So...

05:31.948 --> 05:35.149
it was a girl in his office?

05:37.419 --> 05:39.704
She knew she had it.

05:39.705 --> 05:42.874
She was too embarrassed to say anything.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.843
She wasn't too embarrassed
to have sex with my husband,

05:44.844 --> 05:46.794
but telling him that she
was a syphilitic whore,

05:46.795 --> 05:49.380
well, that was more than she could bear.

05:51.634 --> 05:56.354
You know, from what I recall,

05:56.355 --> 05:59.390
you chose him

05:59.391 --> 06:03.444
because you wanted more
calm than I could give you.

06:04.980 --> 06:07.098
It wasn't that simple.

06:08.484 --> 06:11.286
Nothing with you ever was.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.905
You were exciting

06:13.906 --> 06:16.908
and brilliant.

06:16.909 --> 06:19.360
I couldn't have loved you more.

06:21.163 --> 06:24.198
I was so proud to be on your arm.

06:25.217 --> 06:26.668
Most times when we were together,

06:26.669 --> 06:32.039
I felt like I was taking
the best bite of the plum.

06:34.176 --> 06:37.095
It was the rest of it.

06:37.096 --> 06:41.048
I just didn't need the
chaos as much as you.

06:42.268 --> 06:46.271
The rides in Coney Island
are great fun once in a while,

06:46.272 --> 06:48.406
but not every day.

06:48.407 --> 06:51.726
Those rides were tame compared to you.

06:52.661 --> 06:54.245
I had to choose

06:54.246 --> 06:56.647
between two men who loved me.

06:58.367 --> 07:02.403
A situation I most certainly
will never find myself in again.

07:04.206 --> 07:07.575
We can put your apparatus back on.

07:16.761 --> 07:21.639
You're a good candidate for
restoration but it won't be an easy go.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.225
Very little has been.

07:24.226 --> 07:26.694
How does it work?

07:26.695 --> 07:28.513
Well...

07:29.448 --> 07:32.617
the surgeon selects a piece of skin

07:32.618 --> 07:34.902
from your arm here.

07:34.903 --> 07:38.239
He then makes a flap which
stays partially fixed to your arm

07:38.240 --> 07:40.041
to keep the skin alive

07:40.042 --> 07:42.543
and provide blood flow from that end.

07:42.544 --> 07:45.630
He then attaches the other end of
the flap to the bridge of your nose,

07:45.631 --> 07:47.415
attempting as best he can

07:47.416 --> 07:50.335
to connect a good blood supply.

07:50.336 --> 07:52.670
A harness is then put in
place for several weeks

07:52.671 --> 07:55.340
to ensure that the arm
doesn't come away from the face

07:55.341 --> 07:57.342
and put stress on the connection.

07:57.343 --> 07:59.260
When the skin is fully grafted

07:59.261 --> 08:02.931
and has its own flow
of blood from your face,

08:02.932 --> 08:06.351
the piece is cut away from your arm

08:06.352 --> 08:08.903
and then the healthy skin

08:08.904 --> 08:11.939
is used to shape you something

08:11.940 --> 08:13.975
where your nose would have been.

08:15.611 --> 08:18.279
So it's awful.

08:18.280 --> 08:22.283
With no bone or cartilage
to support the skin,

08:22.284 --> 08:25.036
it won't be more than a
covering for that hole.

08:25.037 --> 08:28.539
But it will partially restore you.

08:29.792 --> 08:32.493
Not to what you were, I'm afraid.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.746
I haven't been that for quite a while.

08:39.768 --> 08:42.471
I'll give you the name
of an excellent surgeon.

08:42.472 --> 08:44.389
Won't you do it?

08:44.390 --> 08:46.524
I'm not really able to right now.

08:46.525 --> 08:48.643
Is it a matter of your
schedule? I can wait.

08:48.644 --> 08:50.812
No, no, no. It's just...

08:50.813 --> 08:54.065
Dr. Gibbons at Bellevue has
performed this many times.

08:54.066 --> 08:57.268
I'd really feel more
comfortable if it was you.

08:58.954 --> 09:02.457
I know it's a lot to ask,

09:02.458 --> 09:06.193
but try to remember me before.

09:07.546 --> 09:10.331
Oh, I remember you perfectly.

09:12.167 --> 09:15.169
Then please, John.

09:15.170 --> 09:18.389
You look like trouble's been
visiting you there, Herm.

09:18.390 --> 09:20.258
A sudden tooth extraction.

09:20.259 --> 09:23.345
You'll never catch me going to no dentist.

09:23.346 --> 09:25.847
Keep sticking to your guns there, Dietz.

09:25.848 --> 09:27.850
Barbarians, every one of them.

09:27.851 --> 09:30.185
This one certainly was.

09:30.186 --> 09:33.020
Go on, get yourself an
edge. It'll take the sting.

09:33.021 --> 09:35.490
I'll take a Phenacetin and
rub some rum and cocaine on it.

09:35.491 --> 09:38.910
It should be fine. I'm
just here for my body.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.579
That's gonna be a bit of a problem.

09:41.580 --> 09:43.898
I took a better offer.

09:45.167 --> 09:48.202
You promised me a dead man.

09:48.203 --> 09:50.538
Some fellas from Cornell came by

09:50.539 --> 09:53.291
and gave me 75 bucks for the stiff.

09:53.292 --> 09:55.376
You've never given me more than 20.

09:55.377 --> 09:58.813
For fuck's sake, Dietz.

09:58.814 --> 10:02.083
I needed that corpse.

10:16.865 --> 10:18.566
Effie, dear.

10:18.567 --> 10:21.903
I'll... I'll be with you in just a moment.

10:21.904 --> 10:23.988
I'm actually in a bit of a hurry.

10:23.989 --> 10:26.824
- I'll only be a minute.
- So will I.

10:27.493 --> 10:29.577
Of course.

10:29.578 --> 10:31.946
We'll reconvene later.

10:39.588 --> 10:43.090
She's wearing more than a
year of my wages on her back.

10:44.092 --> 10:45.761
There was a day you would have apologized

10:45.762 --> 10:47.596
for not introducing me.

10:47.597 --> 10:50.815
Because I know you have no
interest in meeting any of them.

10:50.816 --> 10:54.268
Of course not, but now they know that.

10:54.269 --> 10:57.105
My father always ran his haberdashery

10:57.106 --> 10:59.240
with unfailing politeness.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.159
Everyone of my class did.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.910
You could certainly take a lesson from us.

11:02.911 --> 11:06.864
And how polite was he when
his creditors shut his doors?

11:06.865 --> 11:10.368
Even then he was as courteous as a king.

11:10.369 --> 11:13.738
Certainly kinder to me than
you are being right now.

11:15.090 --> 11:17.175
I'm sorry.

11:17.176 --> 11:20.044
I'm in a bit of pain here.

11:20.045 --> 11:24.465
My mouth feels like an attack
from the hounds of hell.

11:24.466 --> 11:27.518
You didn't even tell me
you were going to a dentist.

11:27.519 --> 11:30.137
- I should know these things.
- It was last minute.

11:30.138 --> 11:32.306
I wasn't expecting he'd pull the tooth.

11:32.307 --> 11:34.759
It was foolish of you to let him.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.064
Expect you're here for some money.

11:40.065 --> 11:43.819
You left the apartment
so quickly this morning,

11:43.820 --> 11:47.038
I didn't even have a chance to ask.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.374
Well, here you are

11:50.375 --> 11:52.793
asking now.

11:52.794 --> 11:54.712
It's not much.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.831
I wanted to take a few friends to lunch

11:56.832 --> 11:59.917
and the children need new
suits for Sunday school.

11:59.918 --> 12:02.136
And while I was out, I
thought maybe I'd have

12:02.137 --> 12:05.539
a little look for myself at Bonwit Teller.

12:07.392 --> 12:09.710
Of course.

12:19.821 --> 12:21.689
You haven't by chance

12:21.690 --> 12:24.192
seen those pearl earrings
that you bought me, have you?

12:24.193 --> 12:26.361
No.

12:26.362 --> 12:28.363
Not at all.

12:28.364 --> 12:29.580
Are they missing?

12:29.581 --> 12:31.415
They're no longer in my jewelry case.

12:31.416 --> 12:33.901
I couldn't have misplaced them.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.371
Perhaps the maid.

12:38.540 --> 12:41.125
I was thinking that myself.

12:41.126 --> 12:42.878
You need to fire her.

12:42.879 --> 12:46.413
First thing when she arrives
for work tomorrow morning.

12:49.851 --> 12:53.804
How busy is it down here
after, say, 11:00 P.M.?

12:53.805 --> 12:56.190
It's just me and Woodson
keeping the boilers going.

12:56.191 --> 12:57.893
No one else shows.

12:57.894 --> 13:00.361
And after dark, if you
ain't got business down here,

13:00.362 --> 13:01.862
you ain't coming down here.

13:01.863 --> 13:04.899
And no one but us got business down here.

13:05.784 --> 13:08.369
What if I had some business down here?

13:08.370 --> 13:10.788
I ain't losing my job for nobody.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.740
You won't.

13:12.741 --> 13:16.244
You and Hiram will simply be
adding a few responsibilities

13:16.245 --> 13:18.829
and earning a little extra on the side

13:18.830 --> 13:20.998
for your troubles.

13:22.501 --> 13:25.669
Think about it. Excuse me for a moment.

13:26.922 --> 13:28.757
Time's up.

13:28.758 --> 13:30.224
May I see?

13:30.225 --> 13:33.961
Okay, but I've never
sewn chicken skin before.

13:34.763 --> 13:37.181
I asked for 100 stitches.

13:37.182 --> 13:40.651
I did that. And then
since I still had time,

13:40.652 --> 13:42.737
I did 100 more.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.740
The first bunch I did like you told me.

13:45.741 --> 13:48.777
The second bunch I did
like we do on the pillows

13:48.778 --> 13:50.277
so the seam don't show.

13:50.278 --> 13:52.146
Is that okay, sir?

13:54.783 --> 13:57.168
Congratulations, Miss Odom.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.920
You've just been promoted from laundress

13:59.921 --> 14:02.323
to surgical nurse.

14:04.092 --> 14:06.493
- Good night, Miss Cummins.
- Good night, sir.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.547
Doctors, good evening to you.

14:09.548 --> 14:10.799
- Evening.
- Evening.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.884
See you bright and early, Nurse Baker.

15:34.216 --> 15:36.100
Nurse.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.769
Nurse!

15:52.734 --> 15:54.902
You're not a nurse.

15:54.903 --> 15:57.271
No, but I'm a doctor.

15:58.071 --> 16:00.407
Where does it hurt? Your lower left side?

16:16.558 --> 16:19.009
This should help with the pain.

16:21.763 --> 16:25.015
And you'll be able to sleep.

16:45.453 --> 16:47.087
Evening.

16:47.088 --> 16:49.291
Back door to the kitchen?

16:49.292 --> 16:51.091
Right there.

16:51.092 --> 16:53.327
Thank you.

16:59.050 --> 17:01.919
I'm here about the washing job.

17:11.613 --> 17:14.231
It's all there.

17:14.232 --> 17:16.784
And just in the nick

17:16.785 --> 17:19.703
for the man from the Knick.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.039
Now how hard was that, Herm?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.992
Like raising the dead.

17:28.296 --> 17:30.998
Aren't you forgetting something?

17:53.905 --> 17:55.406
That is not my tooth.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.558
Get the fuck out!

19:11.599 --> 19:15.602
It's not as simple as running
any other sort of business.

19:15.603 --> 19:18.322
Meetings and budget-making, that's true,

19:18.323 --> 19:21.492
but there are decisions that I make

19:21.493 --> 19:26.613
every single day that could
change the whole place.

19:26.614 --> 19:29.451
Hospital's no game.

19:29.452 --> 19:31.085
It's not like the law

19:31.086 --> 19:33.671
or making an advert.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.173
You save people's lives.

19:36.174 --> 19:37.541
It's brave.

19:37.542 --> 19:40.795
I don't think I could be around all that.

19:40.796 --> 19:44.014
A beautiful girl like
you should not have to be.

19:44.015 --> 19:46.416
I'll see to that.

19:49.137 --> 19:52.690
I got you a little something.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.892
Hermie...

19:54.893 --> 19:57.111
No.

19:57.112 --> 20:00.864
- What is it?
- Be patient, little girl.

20:00.865 --> 20:02.366
Come on, let me see.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.484
Close your eyes.

20:06.654 --> 20:09.323
Now open them.

20:09.324 --> 20:10.958
Hermie!

20:12.460 --> 20:14.912
- It's too much.
- No.

20:14.913 --> 20:18.415
There is no such thing
where you're concerned.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.286
They're wonderful.

20:25.223 --> 20:27.424
Put them on.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.933
Let me see.

20:36.684 --> 20:40.487
Oh, yes.

20:40.488 --> 20:43.557
You're the most wonderful man in the world.

20:44.859 --> 20:47.060
Now do you want your special gift?

20:47.912 --> 20:49.913
Yes.

20:49.914 --> 20:52.449
Will you show me the "Busy Flea"?

20:58.123 --> 21:00.791
Oh, dear. Is that a flea on me?

21:02.378 --> 21:04.212
It just went under my dress.

21:04.213 --> 21:06.847
Where is it?

21:06.848 --> 21:09.716
- Where is it?
- It's on your tit.

21:27.368 --> 21:29.686
- Who is it?
- I'm...

21:30.789 --> 21:33.523
I'm here about the washing job.

21:38.329 --> 21:40.130
Anyone see you?

21:40.131 --> 21:41.665
I don't think so.

21:41.666 --> 21:43.417
All right.

21:43.418 --> 21:45.385
You're gonna go right
through this door here.

21:45.386 --> 21:47.137
He should be right there.

21:47.138 --> 21:49.339
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.764
What's your name?

21:56.765 --> 21:59.566
Larkin.

21:59.567 --> 22:01.401
Trouble?

22:01.402 --> 22:03.153
I...

22:03.154 --> 22:05.906
I've been passing blood. I don't know why.

22:05.907 --> 22:09.611
The doc's working on a patient,
so it's gonna be a while.

22:09.612 --> 22:11.995
We got "The Evening World"
and tonight's "Tribune."

22:11.996 --> 22:14.197
Have a seat.

22:32.967 --> 22:36.720
I've taken an anterior
approach to the groin,

22:36.721 --> 22:38.805
dividing the posterior wall

22:38.806 --> 22:41.975
of the inguinal canal.

22:41.976 --> 22:45.679
I-N-G-U-I-N-A-L.

22:46.564 --> 22:48.398
Ligating the peritoneal sac.

22:48.399 --> 22:52.153
P-E-R-I-T-O-N-E-A-L.

22:52.154 --> 22:56.240
I will now carry out a
three-layer hernia repair

22:56.241 --> 22:58.692
of my own design.

22:59.744 --> 23:01.628
Miss Odom.

23:01.629 --> 23:04.765
I'd like you to begin ligating
from that point right there.

23:04.766 --> 23:07.167
- You want me to begin what?
- Sewing.

23:07.168 --> 23:10.171
Use the stitch I taught
you on the bottom layer.

23:10.172 --> 23:13.307
I will start the next layer from this side

23:13.308 --> 23:17.261
and we'll do the third layer the same.

23:17.262 --> 23:19.096
Blood's gonna get all over the thread.

23:19.097 --> 23:21.349
That is to be expected. Just sew.

23:21.350 --> 23:22.850
Make sure it holds fast

23:22.851 --> 23:24.768
to guard against any re-herniation.

23:24.769 --> 23:27.821
Are you sure it's okay
for me to be doing this?

23:27.822 --> 23:30.223
There's no one here to stop you.

23:43.705 --> 23:45.923
How's it progressing, love?

23:45.924 --> 23:48.042
It isn't.

23:48.043 --> 23:49.676
What's the issue?

23:49.677 --> 23:51.797
The issue is that Miss
Brownlee's Finishing School

23:51.798 --> 23:54.368
never taught me the
French words for coagulate

23:54.369 --> 23:56.633
or duodenum or infarction.

23:56.634 --> 23:58.435
It's all very technical.

23:58.436 --> 24:01.421
I was taught to serve tea cakes.

24:02.724 --> 24:05.809
If you needed assistance
deciphering a restaurant menu,

24:05.810 --> 24:08.563
then I'd be your girl.

24:08.564 --> 24:11.064
Everett, I tried.

24:11.065 --> 24:13.650
No, no, no, yeah, you did.

24:14.736 --> 24:16.787
Don't worry yourself, pet.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.989
Why are you so against asking Edwards?

24:18.990 --> 24:20.457
The promotion is already his.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.744
He can't take it from you twice.

24:22.745 --> 24:26.613
He's already taken enough
without any merit to justify it.

24:28.416 --> 24:32.052
No, he's not worthy of
the job. He never has been.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.304
Everett, I'm so sorry.

24:34.305 --> 24:35.922
You ask so little of me,

24:35.923 --> 24:38.758
and when you do need me, I fail you.

24:42.847 --> 24:45.182
You could never fail me.

24:47.151 --> 24:50.971
No, it was unfair of me to ask
this of you at such a late hour.

24:53.775 --> 24:56.276
Lillian needs a feeding.

24:56.277 --> 24:58.612
As soon as I'm finished, I can try again.

24:58.613 --> 25:01.198
No, no, this is good. Thank you, Eleanor.

25:40.154 --> 25:42.656
It's a girl. Six months at most.

25:42.657 --> 25:45.042
Should I get a doctor
so she can be examined?

25:45.043 --> 25:47.161
Only if you want it done poorly.

25:47.162 --> 25:49.629
But please run a small bath for her.

25:49.630 --> 25:51.798
Thank you, Theresa.

25:56.337 --> 25:58.672
She's a lucky wee babe.

25:58.673 --> 26:02.208
To have made it this far, I mean.

26:34.459 --> 26:36.543
Excuse me.

26:36.544 --> 26:38.261
- Excuse me. Good morning.
- Good morning.

26:38.262 --> 26:40.514
Is that beef suet in rice gruel?

26:40.515 --> 26:43.249
- Yes.
- May I have a bowl, please?

26:54.562 --> 26:56.446
How are you feeling this morning?

26:56.447 --> 26:58.148
Stiff.

26:58.149 --> 27:00.934
Probably the mattress. You hungry?

27:00.935 --> 27:02.452
Not really.

27:02.453 --> 27:04.104
You should probably eat something.

27:04.105 --> 27:07.607
This will nourish you and
go easy on your stomach.

27:11.295 --> 27:13.613
That looks pretty good.

27:15.082 --> 27:16.750
Wish I could keep you here longer,

27:16.751 --> 27:20.787
but I can't risk the
people upstairs finding out.

27:20.788 --> 27:24.057
I'll arrange a ride home for you
before the morning staff arrives.

27:24.058 --> 27:26.928
One of the coal men will
carry you out to the coach.

27:26.929 --> 27:28.695
So I can go back to work, then?

27:28.696 --> 27:31.264
No. No, not for several weeks.

27:31.265 --> 27:33.400
Strict bed rest.

27:33.401 --> 27:36.853
I'm guessing that work is what gave
you the hernia in the first place.

27:38.272 --> 27:41.141
I'll write out instructions on
how to change your dressings.

27:42.493 --> 27:44.111
Can you read?

27:44.112 --> 27:47.313
My wife does. Better than me.

27:48.499 --> 27:50.367
Well...

27:52.203 --> 27:54.154
make sure you eat.

28:00.328 --> 28:04.131
Rockefeller just pledged $100,000

28:04.132 --> 28:05.415
to Wellesley College.

28:05.416 --> 28:07.501
"Students indulged in cheers

28:07.502 --> 28:09.253
for the college and Mr. Rockefeller

28:09.254 --> 28:11.421
before recitation."

28:12.640 --> 28:15.343
Seems there's no love
letter to John D. too sweet

28:15.344 --> 28:17.678
that the "Times" won't print one weekly.

28:17.679 --> 28:19.680
They delight in reminding us

28:19.681 --> 28:22.816
just how easily he can
give his fortune away,

28:22.817 --> 28:24.902
even though he is a bit of a prick.

28:24.903 --> 28:26.019
August.

28:26.020 --> 28:28.405
I'm sure you and Jesse are pleased

28:28.406 --> 28:29.990
to have our boy back in New York.

28:29.991 --> 28:32.743
Oh, we are. Can't thank
you enough for that.

28:32.744 --> 28:36.030
He's a smart boy, but I'm
sure you already know that.

28:36.031 --> 28:38.032
Nobody gets tired of hearing good things

28:38.033 --> 28:40.233
about their children, Captain, sir.

28:42.203 --> 28:47.240
I have always known a quality investment.

28:48.126 --> 28:51.295
And he has proven himself
to be worth every penny.

28:51.296 --> 28:55.599
Well, I hope our Algernon'll
continue to prove you right.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.101
Some more creamed potatoes?

28:58.102 --> 29:00.137
You know I can't resist.

29:10.448 --> 29:11.732
Here we are.

29:11.733 --> 29:13.600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:23.344 --> 29:26.012
How are Thackery and Algernon getting on?

29:26.013 --> 29:29.016
- Nothing's changed.
- Do I need to step in?

29:29.017 --> 29:31.401
I can certainly give Thack's leash a tug.

29:31.402 --> 29:35.072
Algernon says he wants to take
care of the matter himself.

29:35.073 --> 29:37.140
Well, you let me know.

29:38.242 --> 29:42.312
We have a bit of history,
the good doctor and I.

29:43.197 --> 29:44.498
Darling, any word from Phillip?

29:44.499 --> 29:47.501
Yes, he sent a cable. He's in Chicago now.

29:47.502 --> 29:49.836
His train arrives here on the 12th.

29:49.837 --> 29:52.005
I do hope he'll be pleased
with the arrangements

29:52.006 --> 29:53.673
we've already made for your wedding.

29:53.674 --> 29:58.044
Now, there is a young man no
one will dare underestimate.

29:58.045 --> 30:00.347
He and Henry have done a fine job

30:00.348 --> 30:02.716
securing my new freight
lines to the Orient.

30:02.717 --> 30:04.801
It is a shame that Henry couldn't be here

30:04.802 --> 30:06.770
for last night's opening at the Met.

30:06.771 --> 30:09.106
He does love it so.

30:09.107 --> 30:11.559
The Abbotts weren't in
attendance last night either.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.693
They've never missed an opening.

30:13.694 --> 30:15.362
Didn't you hear?

30:15.363 --> 30:18.815
Leonard and Franklin were
struck down with the typhoid.

30:18.816 --> 30:21.234
They're at the Manhattan Hospital.

30:21.235 --> 30:24.321
- When?
- Day before last. Dreadfully sick.

30:24.322 --> 30:26.072
And didn't you tell me Daniel
Hemming and his daughter

30:26.073 --> 30:28.708
- were admitted to the Knick with the same?
- Yes.

30:28.709 --> 30:31.128
Do you know if they've been
spending any time with immigrants?

30:31.129 --> 30:32.747
They carry it, you know.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.916
Oh, for God's sake, Mother.

30:34.917 --> 30:38.835
Let's just hope this isn't
the beginning of an epidemic.

30:42.256 --> 30:44.124
Hmm.

30:45.143 --> 30:47.794
John D.

31:06.781 --> 31:08.782
Ma'am.

31:16.457 --> 31:18.124
Start with the junction boxes.

31:18.125 --> 31:20.827
- Thread it back to the fixtures.
- All right.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.769
Obviously the duty nurse wasn't lying

31:29.770 --> 31:31.972
when she said you'd been working all night.

31:31.973 --> 31:34.141
It's a slaughterhouse in here.

31:34.142 --> 31:37.394
Now you see why we have no Jewish doctors.

31:37.395 --> 31:41.364
But it seems they've all died in vain.

31:41.365 --> 31:43.867
I'm no further ahead than when I arrived.

31:43.868 --> 31:46.453
Perhaps Dr. Edwards could help.

31:46.454 --> 31:48.322
What is it with your allegiance to him?

31:48.323 --> 31:51.325
His family has worked for
us since before he was born.

31:51.326 --> 31:54.127
My father is very loyal to his employees.

31:54.128 --> 31:55.795
In the house, maybe.

31:55.796 --> 31:59.032
I'm sure his men down at the
shipyards would tell a different story.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.085
Dr. Edwards is no pet.

32:02.086 --> 32:06.339
He's been a person of substance
for as long as I've known him.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.593
Did you want something?

32:09.594 --> 32:12.646
A few days ago, two patients
were admitted with typhoid fever

32:12.647 --> 32:16.233
and just this morning I've
heard of another case breaking

32:16.234 --> 32:17.734
in a separate household.

32:17.735 --> 32:20.020
That's 50 fewer than
are likely to be admitted

32:20.021 --> 32:21.771
to hospitals on any given day in this city.

32:21.772 --> 32:25.609
Not quite. One was at the
Abbott house on 58th and 5th

32:25.610 --> 32:27.761
and another at the Hemmings'.

32:27.762 --> 32:29.030
What, the banking family?

32:29.031 --> 32:31.248
And coal and some cattle in the West.

32:31.249 --> 32:32.949
Bully for them.

32:32.950 --> 32:36.202
If it were down on Mulberry or
Delancey Street, I'd understand.

32:36.203 --> 32:38.338
Despite what you might believe,

32:38.339 --> 32:41.291
sickness isn't a result of poor character.

32:41.292 --> 32:44.294
Germs don't examine your bank book.

32:44.295 --> 32:47.514
Try not to let your prejudice
against anyone else's success

32:47.515 --> 32:49.432
but your own cloud your judgment.

32:49.433 --> 32:51.385
Germs may be indifferent to wealth,

32:51.386 --> 32:54.889
but typhoid ones do enjoy poor sanitation,

32:54.890 --> 32:57.224
cramped quarters, and
a lack of proper sewage.

32:57.225 --> 32:58.692
I grant you that.

32:58.693 --> 33:00.026
So, I ask you again,

33:00.027 --> 33:02.646
with none of these negative
elements being present,

33:02.647 --> 33:05.482
are the cases of the Abbotts
and the Hemmings peculiar?

33:05.483 --> 33:08.652
Well, at the very least surprising.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.738
Perhaps we should summon Inspector Speight

33:11.739 --> 33:13.990
and have a word.

33:23.250 --> 33:25.302
What happened to that other fellow?

33:25.303 --> 33:27.504
The one who's sick like me.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.674
Mr. Olynyk?

33:30.675 --> 33:32.458
He didn't survive.

33:35.096 --> 33:37.764
But despite you both
having similar diagnoses,

33:37.765 --> 33:40.817
we are working on a very different
procedure to try out on you.

33:40.818 --> 33:43.019
Not to worry.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.575
- Are you cold?
- Yeah.

33:48.576 --> 33:50.910
- Should we go in?
- Yeah.

33:50.911 --> 33:53.146
Yes. Come on, my love.

33:54.115 --> 33:56.700
Okay. Come on, everybody.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.818
Let's get inside for lunch.

34:02.123 --> 34:04.707
If they only knew.

34:06.127 --> 34:08.963
Knew what?

34:08.964 --> 34:11.464
What you really are.

34:22.525 --> 34:25.195
Her father died last night.

34:25.196 --> 34:27.030
She's still suffering

34:27.031 --> 34:29.232
and it's anyone's guess if she'll survive.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.650
Both have typhoid fever.

34:31.652 --> 34:34.036
Another family from uptown, the Abbotts,

34:34.038 --> 34:37.206
have two members admitted to the
German hospital with the same.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.492
And there are rumors that Elihu Brown

34:39.493 --> 34:42.128
had two of his live-in
servants fall ill in January,

34:42.129 --> 34:44.581
but he kept it quiet for obvious reasons.

34:44.581 --> 34:45.833
What reasons?

34:45.833 --> 34:47.833
He didn't wish to stop an outbreak?

34:47.835 --> 34:50.503
I think you can understand
a man in his position

34:50.504 --> 34:52.054
not wanting to stir up a fuss.

34:52.056 --> 34:53.806
To be frank with you,
Miss Robertson, in my work,

34:53.808 --> 34:56.559
upsetting the apple cart
is the bulk of my job.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.845
Nobody likes to see me coming.

34:58.846 --> 35:01.348
Do you think there's any
relation between the cases?

35:01.349 --> 35:03.149
It's fishy.

35:03.150 --> 35:05.268
Your type don't see much
of this sort of thing.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.855
In the tenements, six cases
would have blown up to 60

35:07.856 --> 35:09.939
in a couple weeks and
we'd know what we have.

35:09.940 --> 35:12.193
But uptown, it's sneaky.

35:12.194 --> 35:13.861
It don't spread.

35:13.862 --> 35:16.030
It hops, picking places to land.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.248
Then you'll investigate?

35:18.249 --> 35:20.867
Something giving rich
folks a poor folks' disease?

35:20.868 --> 35:22.535
It needs a look.

35:22.536 --> 35:24.838
I'll call on the family
and make my inquiries.

35:24.839 --> 35:26.206
I'll come with you.

35:26.207 --> 35:28.208
I've been above 14th Street before, miss.

35:28.209 --> 35:29.793
I don't need a guide.

35:29.794 --> 35:33.380
But you'll need an
ambassador to get in the door.

35:33.381 --> 35:35.382
Miss Robertson,

35:35.383 --> 35:38.385
I have the full power
of the health department

35:38.386 --> 35:40.019
and the city of New York.

35:40.020 --> 35:42.605
I have the authority to
get into any door I want.

35:42.606 --> 35:46.392
Perhaps so, but if you want anyone
to talk to you inside those doors,

35:46.393 --> 35:49.563
you'll never speak like
that to their faces.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.531
Hey, Doc. How long has she got?

35:51.532 --> 35:52.615
Not very.

35:52.616 --> 35:54.901
Temperature is higher. Diarrhea is worse.

35:54.902 --> 35:57.370
I'm worried her bowels may have perforated.

35:57.371 --> 36:00.606
I'll have Dr. Thackery take a look.

36:04.128 --> 36:05.579
Rhus tox?

36:05.580 --> 36:07.747
Three times a day.

36:17.808 --> 36:18.975
Stools?

36:18.976 --> 36:21.262
My first concern was when the fat globules

36:21.263 --> 36:22.846
showed up and then the blood.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.431
You think it's just the treatment?

36:24.432 --> 36:26.733
No, her weak pulse and
everything you're telling me

36:26.734 --> 36:28.401
suggests otherwise.

36:28.402 --> 36:31.354
It's most likely her intestines
are already perforated.

36:31.355 --> 36:34.608
Would you give her one
teaspoon of turpentine

36:34.609 --> 36:37.160
every three hours to
help with the perforation?

36:37.161 --> 36:40.980
See if that relieves some of her agony.

36:41.949 --> 36:43.784
So you won't operate?

36:43.785 --> 36:45.752
The risk would be too great.

36:45.753 --> 36:47.620
But there is a procedure?

36:47.621 --> 36:49.255
There would be no point.

36:49.256 --> 36:52.626
The point would be to save a young girl
who has her entire life ahead of her.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.093
She's too far gone.

36:54.094 --> 36:56.596
She would almost certainly
die under the knife.

36:56.597 --> 36:58.465
And if she did miraculously survive,

36:58.466 --> 37:01.468
her life would be grossly
compromised forever.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.937
Perforation means the loops

37:03.938 --> 37:06.139
of her intestines are sticking together.

37:06.140 --> 37:08.141
I would have to resect large areas,

37:08.142 --> 37:10.476
which would inevitably
lead to more perforations,

37:10.477 --> 37:12.479
more surgeries, more complications.

37:12.480 --> 37:16.315
But a chance she could live
is better than doing nothing.

37:18.235 --> 37:20.653
If little Cora knew the details,

37:20.654 --> 37:22.822
even in her delirious state,

37:22.823 --> 37:25.241
I am certain that she would
elect to have her own will

37:25.242 --> 37:26.743
determine if she can beat this illness

37:26.744 --> 37:30.164
rather than die at my
hands in an operating room.

37:32.167 --> 37:35.585
Thus far we have fried the
heart, crisped the aorta,

37:35.586 --> 37:38.254
and left behind a terrible puncture wound.

37:38.255 --> 37:41.340
Yes, but it does smell
pleasantly like breakfast.

37:43.177 --> 37:47.848
So, the wire corrodes
inside the artery every time.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.933
Perhaps it's too much current.

37:49.934 --> 37:52.819
Right, or maybe the wrong sort of wire.

37:52.820 --> 37:56.239
Maybe copper is wrong and tin is right.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.191
But how do we know?

37:59.360 --> 38:01.444
Here.

38:05.950 --> 38:09.669
It says here to"couper
en dessous du ventricule."

38:09.670 --> 38:11.454
We know that ventricule is ventricle

38:11.455 --> 38:12.873
and couper means to cut.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.507
Right but it also means

38:14.508 --> 38:18.294
"to nick, to slice, to
disconnect, or to break."

38:18.295 --> 38:20.847
So we don't know whether we're
supposed to make a small nick

38:20.848 --> 38:22.432
or cut the whole thing off.

38:22.433 --> 38:25.268
Even the simplest words
mean five things in French.

38:25.269 --> 38:27.053
They are the worst.

38:29.890 --> 38:33.393
- I think we should just...
- No, we don't need him.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.895
He likely isn't as familiar
with the procedure as he claims.

38:35.896 --> 38:38.097
We're far better off without him.

38:39.283 --> 38:43.436
Everett, he did co-author the paper.

38:44.622 --> 38:45.955
Those people are known

38:45.956 --> 38:48.491
to exaggerate their
accomplishments, Bertie.

38:57.001 --> 39:00.286
One second.

39:02.589 --> 39:04.674
Yes?

39:05.592 --> 39:06.927
Do you have a moment, Doctor?

39:06.928 --> 39:08.394
Ah, Bertie the Brave

39:08.395 --> 39:10.597
and the good Knight Gallinger.

39:10.598 --> 39:14.433
All I want to hear is that it
works and you got it solved.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.154
No, we're hopelessly lost.

39:18.155 --> 39:21.491
- But we did find something.
- It's not good.

39:21.492 --> 39:23.610
But it might be.

39:23.611 --> 39:26.780
It concerns Edwards and
the procedure he described.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.115
We can learn it with Edwards' help,

39:28.116 --> 39:30.784
but it just might be what we had hoped.

39:30.785 --> 39:33.336
Bertie's more of a dreamer
than is good for him.

39:33.337 --> 39:34.871
Edwards is a fraud.

39:34.872 --> 39:37.290
Well, then, he's a fraud who's
been listed as a co-author

39:37.291 --> 39:40.593
of a published paper alongside Dr. Thibaux.

39:40.594 --> 39:43.913
Dr. Algernon C. Edwards.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.851
Seems like we're gonna
need this man after all.

39:48.852 --> 39:49.952
No, we don't.

39:49.953 --> 39:52.639
Calm yourself, Everett.
You'll do the procedure.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.108
All we'll have him do
is talk you through it.

39:55.109 --> 39:58.394
He'll never lay a hand on your patient.

39:58.395 --> 40:00.113
Very well.

40:00.114 --> 40:03.150
Schedule says you're doing a skin
graft on a syphilitic this afternoon.

40:03.151 --> 40:04.817
Yes.

40:04.818 --> 40:08.121
- You need assistance?
- No. I'll be fine.

40:08.122 --> 40:11.074
In fact, you interrupted

40:11.075 --> 40:13.326
my preparations.

40:13.327 --> 40:15.578
Of course.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.085
Open or closed?

40:22.086 --> 40:24.036
Closed.

40:45.826 --> 40:47.860
Hello.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.249
Welcome back.

41:02.793 --> 41:06.379
Dr. Edwards, you're needed downstairs.

41:06.380 --> 41:08.715
I'm in the middle of a procedure.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.883
I ain't asking.

41:15.939 --> 41:19.058
- I told you to stay home.
- I can't lose my job.

41:19.059 --> 41:21.728
Shit, he ain't the only one.
I told you this was a bad idea.

41:21.729 --> 41:23.696
Just help me get him
to the operating table.

41:23.697 --> 41:25.598
And then fetch Miss Odom and
Mrs. Gamble from the laundry.

41:25.599 --> 41:27.163
Right, 'cause they ain't gonna be wondering

41:27.164 --> 41:28.818
why the coal man is
running around upstairs.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.686
Just go!

41:31.955 --> 41:34.657
Yeager's needle and silk.

41:35.909 --> 41:38.160
Nurse Baker?

41:40.964 --> 41:43.366
Steady at 82.

41:48.255 --> 41:50.256
She's got beautiful hair.

41:50.257 --> 41:53.125
That color, what I wouldn't give.

41:55.846 --> 41:57.480
I want to get underneath

41:57.481 --> 41:59.682
to add some sutures to
strengthen the graft.

41:59.683 --> 42:03.185
Could you slightly lift the
flap to allow me access below?

42:08.525 --> 42:11.444
Gently. Gently.

42:15.282 --> 42:17.667
Lucy says you knew her, Dr. Thackery.

42:17.668 --> 42:19.985
She must have been lovely.

42:20.921 --> 42:23.706
Please refer to her as Nurse Elkins.

42:23.707 --> 42:26.492
My apologies, Nurse Elkins.

42:28.962 --> 42:32.715
Okay, now the top. Smaller
gauge needle, please.

42:43.393 --> 42:47.113
Usually it's the streetwalkers,
but she's no prostitute.

42:47.114 --> 42:50.483
Not with those nails. This is a lady.

42:50.484 --> 42:52.518
This is a patient, nothing more.

42:54.321 --> 42:56.239
I just meant that your heart breaks

42:56.240 --> 42:58.291
for a good woman who's in a bad way.

42:58.292 --> 43:01.244
Must be awful to wear the shame
on your face for people to see.

43:01.245 --> 43:04.998
Nurse Baker, another word from you about
anything other than the job at hand,

43:04.999 --> 43:07.333
and I will sew your mouth and nostrils shut

43:07.334 --> 43:10.336
and happily watch you asphyxiate.

43:21.982 --> 43:23.399
He tore it all open and then some.

43:23.400 --> 43:24.685
Blood is coming from everywhere.

43:24.686 --> 43:26.319
We've got to stop it now.

43:26.320 --> 43:27.904
I'm gonna clamp as much as I can

43:27.905 --> 43:31.191
and then you follow behind
me and sew everything you see

43:31.192 --> 43:33.026
that's got blood coming out of it.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.695
His pulse, Mrs. Gamble.

43:34.696 --> 43:36.495
He's still got one.

43:36.496 --> 43:38.197
Close enough.

43:38.198 --> 43:40.449
That's good, Miss Odom.
You're doing just fine.

43:40.450 --> 43:42.702
I'm gonna run out of thread.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.587
- Where do you keep it?
- Right back there.

43:44.588 --> 43:46.906
There ain't none.

43:48.008 --> 43:49.876
Why didn't you tell me we were running low?

43:49.877 --> 43:52.595
- I just did.
- God damn it.

43:52.596 --> 43:54.213
I do laundry.

43:54.214 --> 43:56.015
You want a nurse, you go hire one.

43:56.016 --> 43:59.185
Okay, okay. Just keep suturing
with what you have left

43:59.186 --> 44:02.588
and I... I'll be right back.

44:24.161 --> 44:26.662
Excuse me. A slight emergency
in the outdoor clinic.

44:26.663 --> 44:28.381
I just need some silk.

44:28.382 --> 44:31.884
Edwards, we're operating on
Mr. Gatchell in the morning.

44:31.885 --> 44:33.919
We're gonna need you in
the operating theater.

44:33.920 --> 44:36.422
We're doing your galvanic procedure.

44:36.423 --> 44:38.592
Ah, will you be assisting me?

44:38.593 --> 44:40.426
No, I'll be assisting Gallinger.

44:40.427 --> 44:42.395
It's his patient.

44:42.396 --> 44:44.096
What will I be doing?

44:44.097 --> 44:47.316
Just talking him through the procedure.

44:47.317 --> 44:49.134
That's all.

45:00.113 --> 45:02.031
His pulse, Mrs. Gamble?

45:02.032 --> 45:03.616
It don't feel like it did before.

45:03.617 --> 45:06.286
- It's different.
- How different?

45:06.287 --> 45:08.671
Not so strong. Kind of back and forth.

45:08.672 --> 45:11.124
I get it, then I don't.

45:11.125 --> 45:12.626
Keep sewing. There's one there,

45:12.627 --> 45:14.293
one there, and I'll take that one there.

45:14.294 --> 45:15.795
Now it's gone again.

45:15.796 --> 45:18.414
Come on, Mr. Cockrell.

45:21.802 --> 45:23.804
- Is it back yet?
- No.

45:23.805 --> 45:26.505
And he ain't breathing no more either.

45:29.359 --> 45:31.227
- Anything?
- No.

45:31.228 --> 45:33.846
I think he dead.

45:46.993 --> 45:49.161
Shit!

46:02.092 --> 46:04.293
What should we do with him?

46:06.480 --> 46:09.548
Drop him in the bushes on Murray Hill.

46:11.518 --> 46:13.852
Someone will find him.

46:36.510 --> 46:39.011
That really was like trying to make

46:39.012 --> 46:42.748
a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

46:43.934 --> 46:45.684
What was the point?

46:45.685 --> 46:47.469
She'll look better.

46:48.305 --> 46:51.891
She'll always be alone.

46:51.892 --> 46:54.593
Ruined and diseased.

46:55.896 --> 46:59.231
What kind of a future does she have?

46:59.232 --> 47:01.567
Maybe more than she did.

47:03.403 --> 47:07.072
"No medicine in the
world can do thee good."

47:07.991 --> 47:09.208
In the blackest darkness,

47:09.209 --> 47:12.277
even a dim light is better
than no light at all.

47:13.330 --> 47:15.581
Who said that?

47:15.582 --> 47:18.450
I just did.

47:23.673 --> 47:27.343
But I thought you said
operating was too risky.

47:27.344 --> 47:29.596
Well, sometimes all the options

47:29.597 --> 47:31.847
aren't immediately apparent.

47:31.848 --> 47:35.518
I'd like to try stitching
together two pieces of Cora's gut

47:35.519 --> 47:37.604
to a fold in her peritoneum.

47:37.605 --> 47:40.105
It might give her a chance.

47:40.106 --> 47:42.474
Do I have your permission?

47:43.660 --> 47:44.945
Of course.

47:44.946 --> 47:48.063
I'll have the nurses begin preparing her.

48:11.221 --> 48:14.139
Where is Cora Hemming?
Why didn't anyone fetch me?

48:14.140 --> 48:17.393
Dr. Thackery took her to
surgery about an hour ago.

48:23.233 --> 48:26.602
You'll be very happy to
know, Miss Robertson...

48:28.788 --> 48:30.906
we got lucky.

50:07.887 --> 50:11.424
Far away.

50:11.425 --> 50:14.593
Yeah, I've been lots of places.

50:14.594 --> 50:17.146
Around the world and back again.

50:19.099 --> 50:21.350
Like where?

50:21.351 --> 50:23.319
Delaware.

50:23.320 --> 50:25.738
Yeah, plenty good folk down there.

50:25.739 --> 50:28.023
I got kin in Tennessee.

50:28.024 --> 50:29.442
I've been there a bunch, too.

50:29.443 --> 50:31.193
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

50:31.194 --> 50:34.196
Got a real sojourner over here.

50:36.616 --> 50:38.584
You know what it's like in Memphis?

50:38.585 --> 50:40.586
No.

50:40.587 --> 50:42.705
Hot.

50:42.706 --> 50:45.290
A regular Rudyard Kipling.

50:47.260 --> 50:49.661
You have something to say to me?

50:50.847 --> 50:53.081
No.

50:54.601 --> 50:57.186
I just didn't realize that
around the world and back again

50:57.187 --> 51:00.672
meant anywhere you could get
to in a few days on a horse.

51:02.142 --> 51:04.026
Shut your mouth.

51:04.027 --> 51:06.478
Or I'll shut it for you.

51:08.531 --> 51:10.616
I'd like to see that.

52:32.665 --> 52:40.841
