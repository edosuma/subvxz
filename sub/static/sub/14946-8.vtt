with the Fermitas attacks.

11:50.794 --> 11:54.127
I've been monitoring
web and FTP sites.
There's been zero chatter.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.588
Nothing suggesting an
operation as big as this.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.085

13:06.870 --> 13:07.859
What? He's not dead?

13:07.955 --> 13:09.616
It's a hunch
I'm working on.

monitor him through CCTV,

Without drawing
attention to the fact

13:14.920 --> 13:16.706

a dead Liber8 member?

But I can outsource it.

understand...why.

calling you.

By my count this is your
last parole violation.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.401
Why don't you just
meet with her? Huh?

15:46.488 --> 15:48.228
Talk to her,
then make your decision.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.950
How many people
died in the attack?
KIERA: (ON CELL PHONE) 12.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.744
There are five nerve gases
that fit the profile.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.072
I need to figure out if
the effluent Liber8

15:59.167 --> 16:01.032
stole from Sonmanto would
have the same signature.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.210
Here's the problem.
You combine the effluent
with the other chemicals,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.002
you get a variety of
different reactions.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.005
It's entirely possible that
Sonmanto's waste chemicals
were mixed with say,

16:08.093 --> 16:10.800
dimethylamine and
phosphorous chloride
to create nerve gas.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.003
Okay. Well, then who would
have distilled it?

16:13.098 --> 16:14.508
Kiera, I'm saying
it's a possibility.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.305
It's hard to actually
prove without blood tests

16:16.393 --> 16:19.556
and hard actual physical
proof like a bomb canister.

16:20.397 --> 16:21.933
And if I get you
one of those?

16:22.983 --> 16:24.063

Sonmanto has been lying

24:00.607 --> 24:03.098
about health dangers for
a dozen of their products.

24:03.192 --> 24:04.773
All of which
was stolen.

24:04.861 --> 24:08.479
You'll also find
price fixing, union busting,
stock manipulation.

24:08.573 --> 24:09.858
Really take your pick.

24:10.533 --> 24:12.148
Is any of this verified?

24:12.243 --> 24:14.905

24:16.706 --> 24:18.287
So, theft?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.160
Or whistle-blowing?

24:21.878 --> 24:23.994
I'm not so sure you
can separate the two.

they need to be.
And immediately.

We only get one chance
to do this thing right

before Sonmanto's

into operation.

24:31.012 --> 24:33.094
For what it's worth, I was
authorized to access them

24:33.181 --> 24:34.591
as part of my employment.

24:34.682 --> 24:36.638
Does that include
removing them from
the premises?

24:36.726 --> 24:39.388
Well, when I saw
what was in them
I had to tell someone.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.686
JULIAN: Information
should be free, Detective.

24:42.231 --> 24:43.437
Whistle-blowers too.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.230
I guess I'm prepared
to go to jail.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.104
I'd... I'd just
rather not.

24:50.740 --> 24:51.946

24:53.326 --> 24:54.406
Yeah.

25:00.291 --> 25:01.497
(DOOR CLOSES)
So why him?

25:02.251 --> 25:05.038
He's not exactly
unbiased.

25:05.421 --> 25:06.957
He's not owned
by anybody either.

25:07.048 --> 25:10.040
Yeah, if I start digging
around what do I find out
about Miss Adele Mason?

25:10.134 --> 25:12.750
You'll find she's
someone who loved
herjob and her life.

25:13.429 --> 25:17.217
Who made tiny
allowances as
time passed

25:17.308 --> 25:19.765
because I still believed
in what I was doing
and where I worked.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.643
But now it's too much.
I can't keep making
allowances.

25:22.730 --> 25:23.765
You understand?

25:24.691 --> 25:25.976
I need your help.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.940
Any idea why
a known terrorist
would target you?

25:35.284 --> 25:36.785
Wrong place,
wrong time, I guess.

25:38.705 --> 25:39.990

25:40.957 --> 25:42.447
Yeah. How'd you know?

25:42.542 --> 25:45.955
You went a couple of rounds
with a trained terrorist
and you're still alive.

If he is former military,
then it suggests

They don't hire.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.730
Now if Neelon is
in fact part of this,

35:17.825 --> 35:19.110
he's no doubt
one of theirs.

35:19.201 --> 35:20.862
Damn it.
Stay on target!

35:21.996 --> 35:23.031
All of you.

35:24.915 --> 35:26.371
The pressure's
never been greater.

35:27.751 --> 35:28.831
(LOW WHISTLE)

35:30.587 --> 35:31.747
Betty?

35:32.214 --> 35:33.203
Look, I get it.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.415
That was, like,
one minute in your shoes.

35:35.509 --> 35:37.795
Yeah, well, avoid
the ankle bracelet
ifyou can.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.171
Chafes like a bitch.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.763
You can find
this connection.

35:42.850 --> 35:45.683
I'm so close to getting
Dillon back on my side.

35:45.769 --> 35:47.350
You gotta figure
this out on your own.

35:47.771 --> 35:50.387
I understand,
but please.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.311
Think about it.

35:58.991 --> 35:59.980
What kind of connection?

36:00.075 --> 36:01.986
I don't know.
Bad blood?

36:02.077 --> 36:04.989
Massacre a dozen innocent
people over bad blood?
That's insane.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.911
CARLOS: People lie,
cheat and murder.

36:06.999 --> 36:09.160
That's what "corporations
are people too" means.

36:09.251 --> 36:10.661
Well, Sonmanto's been
interested in buying

36:10.753 --> 36:13.961
a controlling interest
in Fermitas but
negotiations stalled out.

36:14.381 --> 36:15.587
CARLOS: Well, that
wasn’t in the news.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.211
Well, the only reason
I know is because we
own 5% of the company

36:18.302 --> 36:20.384
so they had to
tell us about the deal.

36:20.471 --> 36:22.086
KIERA: And why
didn’t it go through?

36:22.181 --> 36:23.671
Fermitas wouldn't
budge on...

36:24.600 --> 36:25.715
On their stock price.

36:25.809 --> 36:26.844
(SCOFFS)

36:27.686 --> 36:29.267
And what's their
stock at today?

36:29.772 --> 36:31.262
It took a beating
after the attack.

36:32.566 --> 36:35.649
CEOs from both companies
met for breakfast at
6:00 this morning.

36:36.445 --> 36:37.605
No, they couldn't.

36:38.322 --> 36:40.358
Exxon. Blackwater.
DeBeers.

36:40.449 --> 36:42.030
That's what they did.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.197
Check it out.

36:43.285 --> 36:45.697
Sonmanto owns
Grey Point Security.

36:45.788 --> 36:47.073
Bought 'em last year.

36:47.456 --> 36:50.289
And Elton Bibby
wants to meet.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.913
I think he's going to
be able to corroborate
the connection to Grey Point.

36:53.837 --> 36:55.373
And if he corroborates...

36:55.464 --> 36:57.546
Well, then it's
a slam dunk.

36:57.633 --> 36:58.622
Good work, Betty.

36:58.717 --> 36:59.957
Looks like you've
connected the dots.

37:01.178 --> 37:02.338
Thanks, Alec.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.395
JASMINE: Hey!

37:11.647 --> 37:12.682
Heard you
lost yourjob.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.931
It wasn'tjust a job okay?
It was more than that.
A calling?

37:16.193 --> 37:17.182
Yeah.

37:17.611 --> 37:18.726
Yeah, a calling.

37:18.821 --> 37:21.062
It wasn't.
I know that for sure.

37:21.156 --> 37:23.238
Yeah, I know.
A big part to play
in the future, right?

37:23.325 --> 37:25.941
Can't wait.
Aw, look.

37:26.036 --> 37:28.277
No TV. No fans.
No groupies.

37:28.831 --> 37:32.164
No one lining up
to hear the thesis
of mighty Theseus.

37:32.835 --> 37:35.201
Came down here just to
kick me while I'm down?
That's it?

37:38.549 --> 37:40.665
I'm not here to tell you
about your future, kid.

37:41.301 --> 37:42.632
Too many people have
done that already.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.550
It's lame.
Yeah, I agree.

37:46.181 --> 37:48.672
(GRUNTS)
"I agree"?
Just shut up.

37:49.685 --> 37:52.643
First, you gotta be
the guy in charge of
your own damn life.

37:52.729 --> 37:54.640
That means you've
got to toughen up.

37:54.731 --> 37:57.108
You're about as threatening
as a head cold right now.

37:58.694 --> 38:00.559
You think you can
do that for me?

38:01.738 --> 38:03.603
Why? Hmm?
What's in it for you?

38:04.199 --> 38:05.359
I don't know yet.

38:06.785 --> 38:07.991
Get in the car.

38:11.206 --> 38:12.321
Come on.

38:19.131 --> 38:22.294
CARLOS: Sonmanto killed
a dozen people just to get
a better business deal?

38:22.384 --> 38:24.716
KIERA: A blowback
nobody would risk.

38:25.596 --> 38:27.678
Unless they had
the perfect fall guy.

38:27.764 --> 38:28.753
Liber8.

38:28.849 --> 38:31.215
Yeah. And Dillon is only
too happy to go after 'em.

38:31.935 --> 38:34.347
Sonmanto bought immunity
by making themselves

38:34.438 --> 38:36.520
the victim of your
fake whistle-blower.

38:36.607 --> 38:38.472
They changed
the narrative.

38:38.567 --> 38:41.309
We're saying a company
is a mass murderer.

38:41.403 --> 38:42.813
Look,

38:42.905 --> 38:47.649
we found the trail
that led from a hired
mercenary to Sonmanto.

38:47.743 --> 38:50.155
Sonmanto has been
trying to buy Fermitas.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.201
We need more
than a trail.

38:52.289 --> 38:53.870
You can't arrest a company.
We need a name.

38:53.957 --> 38:55.913
Somebody that
initiated all this.

38:56.418 --> 38:58.283
What if it's more
than one person?

38:58.795 --> 38:59.921
What if it's bigger?

(SIGHS)

39:03.842 --> 39:05.252
You know, if we'd
been working together,

39:05.344 --> 39:07.926
you could have told me
that Adele was lying
with just one look.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.676
You think Dillon split
us up on purpose?

39:11.767 --> 39:13.598
Itwould mean that he
knew this was coming.

39:15.479 --> 39:16.935
There's only
one way to find out.

39:18.732 --> 39:20.848
These connections
are very sketchy.

39:20.943 --> 39:24.686
But with time
and further investigation,
they don't have to be.

39:24.780 --> 39:27.522
I swear, Cameron, ifyou
weren't such a bulldog
about Liber8 in the past,

39:27.616 --> 39:28.901
I'd think you were
protecting them.

39:28.992 --> 39:30.653
KIERA: And I
wouldn't do that.

39:30.744 --> 39:34.282
But I think we should
take a closer look at
Sonmanto and Grey Point.

39:34.373 --> 39:37.331
Oh, hell, Iet'sjust
subpoena Sonmanto
and Adele.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.624
If she admits to
being assigned
this bullshit play

39:39.711 --> 39:40.791
that gives us
some leverage.

39:42.923 --> 39:44.288
No, I'm going to
have to say no.

39:45.717 --> 39:46.923
We are not in
the business

39:47.010 --> 39:48.796

and speculation.

Suggesting some
other version of events

39:51.181 --> 39:53.763

evidence just
muddies the water.

Liber8 is behind
this attack, Cameron.

You of all people
should recognize that.

you used to work with.

40:22.838 --> 40:24.544
At least from what
you told me anyway.

40:24.631 --> 40:25.916
And they'd still put
somebody in prison

40:26.008 --> 40:27.999

the wrong thing.

those two things?

I don't know.

He might have
tunnel vision when
it comes to Liber8

usually work on him.

facts would be nice.

would also be nice.

a few days and then
talk to him again.
