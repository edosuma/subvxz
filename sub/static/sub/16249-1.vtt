02:27.689 --> 02:31.441
-Dude, that was sick.
-Yo, you smashed me, kid.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.236
-Did your thing.
-Thanks, man.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.447
Held your own against Spider-Man
over here.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.450
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know.
-Come on, Easy, man.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.411
Why you always gotta be
so pessimistic?

02:42.579 --> 02:43.871
Easy, I keep telling you...

02:44.038 --> 02:47.583
...if we wanna win this Beat the World
competition, our moves gotta be fresh.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.669
We're gonna be the first crew
to bring freerunning to hip-hop.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.432
That's Eric from the Flying Steps.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.725
Yeah, he ain't bad, man.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.186
He's three-time
world solo champion.

03:07.353 --> 03:10.772
His crew has won Beat the World
for the last two years in a row.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.317
I don't know much about hip-hop,
but I know parkour.

03:13.484 --> 03:16.069
I think your idea of putting the two
together is wicked.

03:16.237 --> 03:19.031
This time,
I'm gonna be ready for them.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.124
-What's up, baby?
-Hey, guys.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.752
All right, guys, I gotta go.
You working tonight?

03:31.920 --> 03:33.128
Yeah, yeah.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.880
-See you at work.
-All right, man.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.548
-Catch you later, Maya.
-See you.

03:37.467 --> 03:41.011
-Mind if l take the back way out?
-l don't have a back way.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.805
What the hell?

03:45.725 --> 03:47.726
You know your friend is crazy?

03:47.894 --> 03:49.603
Yeah.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.276
Whoa, what's wrong?

03:57.028 --> 04:01.782
I was working on some flips
and l came out of a roll a little hard.

04:02.242 --> 04:06.328
I know you wanna win this dance
competition, but you gotta be careful.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.913
This isn't some street battle.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.290
I win this and there's no more
working nights...

04:10.458 --> 04:12.834
...no throwing crates and stuff.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.545
I'll have a chance to work
on music videos for Jay-Z...

04:15.713 --> 04:18.173
...making some real money,
you know what l'm saying?

04:18.507 --> 04:23.262
Then l can take care of you in style.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.640
I don't need someone
to take care of me.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.019
It doesn't make a difference to me
how much money you make.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.897
Yeah, that's what you say,
but I know how it goes.

04:34.065 --> 04:37.234
Five years from now,
if l'm still packing crates, it'll be:

04:37.402 --> 04:41.238
"Yuson who? Who? Who's Yuson?"

04:47.203 --> 04:52.666
What l want is a best friend
who will always make me laugh...

04:54.168 --> 04:56.920
...who will be there when l cry...

04:57.630 --> 05:02.884
...and always tell me that I'm beautiful,
even when I'm old, wrinkled and fat.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.013
Hold up. You lost me
on the "wrinkled and fat" part.

05:06.180 --> 05:08.056
Oh, did I? Did l?

05:16.399 --> 05:17.524
That was fast.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.824
Sorry, l have to be somewhere.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.370
Will l see you again?

05:32.832 --> 05:35.417
Sure, sure. l'll give you a call.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.003
But you don't have my number.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.445
Five, six, seven, eight.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.781
One and two, three and four...

06:05.948 --> 06:08.784
...five and six, seven and eight.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.660
Beautiful.

06:10.828 --> 06:14.498
So next part.
Eric's gonna come through the middle.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.799
Down, left, right and one, two.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.565
You're late.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.485
It wouldn't be hip-hop
if l was on time.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.738
Seriously,
how hard is it to be on time?

06:48.408 --> 06:49.574
Big deal. l'm here.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.577
We only have three weeks left
to learn all the new routines.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.915
Since when do you speak
for the crew?

06:57.083 --> 06:59.000
Since Martin put her in charge.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.921
Really?

07:05.341 --> 07:06.842
Congratulations.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.845
Come on, then.
Let's see what Nina's got for us.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.588
Don't be so cold.

08:26.756 --> 08:30.258
-l miss us.
-There's no more us, Eric.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.265
Why are you always torturing me
like this?

08:38.433 --> 08:39.476
Yeah.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.270
I broke up with you because
you cheated on me...

08:42.438 --> 08:45.190
...and l'm supposed to feel sorry
for you?

08:45.942 --> 08:48.068
That's just twisted.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.323
All right. Good job.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.784
It would have been better
if Carlos was here.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.536
He's probably watching the match.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.330
He's hooking up with his cousin
at the travel agency.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.499
Then one of us
should have gone with him.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.501
Because you don't trust him?

09:46.669 --> 09:47.711
I'm just saying.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.838
He's the one that had the dream
to do this.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.215
Without Carlos,
we wouldn't be going anywhere...

09:52.383 --> 09:54.175
...but back to work at the restaurant.

10:33.507 --> 10:36.635
-What are you gonna have, Carlos?
-l want to make a bet on the game.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.179
Oh, man.
I thought you weren't betting anymore.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.973
Twenty thousand on Brazil.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.560
They've never lost to the U.S.
It's a sure thing.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.749
The moves Justin's
giving you guys are sick.

11:07.917 --> 11:11.252
You're Yuson's girl,
so your opinion don't count.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.213
-l gotta go.
-All right, babe.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.756
See you later, okay?

11:15.216 --> 11:17.592
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.838
What are you waiting for?
Let's get started.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.381
Listen, on the real.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.050
How's some white boy from London
supposed to be coming...

11:59.218 --> 12:00.510
...showing us some moves?

12:00.678 --> 12:04.889
Look, mate, it was Yuson's idea
and l'm up for it, but if you ain't into it--

12:05.057 --> 12:07.767
Come on. We have three more weeks
to get this routine down.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.937
It's your crew.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.314
-Okay.
-Start with the move...

12:13.482 --> 12:14.816
...l showed you last week.

12:14.984 --> 12:18.194
-Run up the wall and backflip off.
-Come on, not that shit.

12:18.362 --> 12:19.821
Shit hurts.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.239
-Come on.
-There we go.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.241
That's it. You got it, you got it.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.118
Same energy.
Ready, so we good to go?

12:25.286 --> 12:28.997
Leg powers through, lean back,
look to the ground, and we're good.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.582
-Come on, Easy.
-Yo, yo, Easy.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.459
Oh, man.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.336
Yo, you ready?

12:36.088 --> 12:37.505
There we go.

12:49.685 --> 12:51.227
Laid out.

12:51.395 --> 12:52.687
Oh, sweet.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.356
-Shit still hurt.
-Doesn't hurt me.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.610
Maybe it's a white thing.

13:17.171 --> 13:20.715
Hurry up. We're gonna be late.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.592
I'll wait outside.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.138
Everything's cool, right?

13:27.306 --> 13:29.182
-What do you mean?
-With your cousin.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.643
You are getting him
the money, right?

13:31.811 --> 13:32.894
You don't trust me now?

13:34.021 --> 13:35.355
Of course I do.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.357
You know that.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.692
Okay, let's go.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.570
Where the hell is he?
What is he doing?

13:42.738 --> 13:43.738
-Carlos.
-Come on.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.031
What took you so long?

13:45.199 --> 13:46.783
-You saw how busy it was.
-Come on.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.493
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

14:47.928 --> 14:52.140
Twenty thousand reis,
with interest?

14:52.308 --> 14:56.311
And you're gonna make at
this dance competition in the U.S.?

14:56.478 --> 14:59.314
-That's right.
-What if you don't win?

14:59.481 --> 15:02.066
We're the best.
I mean, we can't lose.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.486
Just like Brazil couldn't lose.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.323
I'll pay double the interest.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.757
All right.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.802
My friends, your tickets to freedom.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.348
I can't believe
that we are really going.

15:33.515 --> 15:36.059
Airline tickets, hotel,
ground transportation.

15:36.226 --> 15:39.520
I even got the hotel
to throw in a free room upgrade.

15:55.537 --> 15:57.789
Let me show you guys something.

16:02.753 --> 16:06.798
The competition is right there
in our backyard.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.885
Now all we have to do is cross
that bridge and it's ours for the taking.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.888
That's all good, but I still say
jumping off of buildings...

16:14.056 --> 16:16.224
...and running into brick walls
isn't hip-hop.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.352
-Yeah, why not?
-Why not?

16:22.106 --> 16:24.732
See? You can't touch this.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.819
There's no groove for what you do.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.862
Sure, there is.
You just ain't seeing it.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.782
-Got something to show me, bring it.
-All right.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.576
Tomorrow, the old warehouse
on River Street, 4:00.

16:35.744 --> 16:37.912
What we gonna do?
We gonna throw down or what?

16:38.414 --> 16:40.707
Just be there. You'll see.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.334
Where are you going, man?

16:43.669 --> 16:46.254
Gotta hook up with a few
of my boys.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.091
-Seriously?
-What?

16:51.677 --> 16:52.719
What?

16:55.764 --> 16:57.098
You gotta be kidding me.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.474
Did he just do that?

17:00.769 --> 17:02.520
This is C-R-O-W Windsor.

17:02.688 --> 17:06.107
Hey, don't forget Beat the World,
coming to Detroit in two weeks.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.193
The best hip-hop crews from around
the world will throw down...

17:09.361 --> 17:11.612
-...for a $1 00,000 first prize.
-All right.

17:39.725 --> 17:43.186
Hey. What are you doing here?

17:43.812 --> 17:46.147
My parents are sitting on the couch.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.399
How you doing,
Mr. and Mrs. Johnson?

17:48.567 --> 17:49.650
Hello, Yuson.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.112
-See, we all good.
-You think you're so smooth.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.324
I gotta be to have a girl like you.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.952
What do you think for tonight?
Movies, dinner, I don't know--

18:00.120 --> 18:01.829
I can't tonight. l got work to do.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.956
It's Friday night. What work to do?

18:04.124 --> 18:06.417
-l gotta write my acceptance speech.
-For what?

18:07.795 --> 18:09.962
The Economics Award
for Excellence?

18:10.130 --> 18:13.341
Oh, that's right. l didn't know
you had to write a speech for that.

18:13.509 --> 18:17.011
I don't just have to give a speech.
I have to write about my essay...

18:17.179 --> 18:20.139
-...and sound intelligent.
-That's a piece of cake for you.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.642
You're the smartest girl l know.
I tell you that.

18:22.810 --> 18:26.229
Well, that's sweet of you to say,
but I still gotta write my speech.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.772
Just bring it to my place.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.358
And how much work do you think
I'm gonna get done?

18:30.526 --> 18:33.861
Come on.
Just like in high school, you know?

18:34.029 --> 18:35.822
You used to come over,
study and stuff.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.323
That's my point.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.701
Come on, trust me.
I'll keep you focused, l promise.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.374
I'm serious.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.835
I am too. l promise.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.757
What's wrong?

18:55.676 --> 18:59.220
Does it look like
I'm getting any work done here?

18:59.388 --> 19:01.097
You gonna leave me
hanging like this?

19:01.265 --> 19:03.057
You know what?
That's your problem.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.227
I told you straight-up
I had work to do.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.395
What about me?

19:08.897 --> 19:10.731
I better go.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.234
Come on, babe.
You sure you don't wanna--?

19:13.402 --> 19:16.737
Yuson, I gotta go.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.574
All right.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.577
-l'll take you home.
-Thank you.

19:22.744 --> 19:24.745
You don't know
what you're missing.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.757
You got 1 5 minutes.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.981
Well, babe, here we go.

19:52.482 --> 19:55.776
Okay. Don't forget tomorrow,
you're picking me up at 6. Okay?

19:55.944 --> 19:57.945
Wait, for what?

19:58.155 --> 19:59.614
Yuson?

19:59.781 --> 20:02.450
Girl, I'm just playing with you.
I know, 6 sharp.

20:02.618 --> 20:06.329
I wouldn't miss your big night
for anything. I'm proud of you, baby.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.373
Thank you.

20:36.151 --> 20:38.986
Man, l got a class in a minute.
What's up?

20:39.404 --> 20:41.155
Why is Nina
choreographing the show?

20:41.323 --> 20:42.323
She'll do great.

20:43.325 --> 20:47.662
I've been here longer than her
and l'm the best dancer in the crew.

20:47.829 --> 20:48.871
Why didn't l get it?

20:49.039 --> 20:52.667
Eric, we all know
you're a great dancer...

20:52.834 --> 20:55.461
...but choreography
is a whole different thing.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.838
And l think she's ready to do it.

20:58.006 --> 21:00.841
-And I'm not?
-l'm not saying this.

21:01.009 --> 21:05.680
But you know, Nina, she got more
passion to do choreography.

21:05.847 --> 21:08.182
That's so much bullshit.

21:08.725 --> 21:11.894
I'm the manager of the Flying Steps.
It's my decision to make.

21:12.062 --> 21:13.312
I've made up my mind.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.696
I don't think you understand
what I'm saying.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.656
I want this.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.326
Maybe the next show.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.662
Do you think Flying Steps
has a chance...

21:29.830 --> 21:32.707
...of winning Beat the World
without me?

21:34.293 --> 21:35.710
What?

21:38.380 --> 21:39.380
What about Nina?

21:40.549 --> 21:42.049
Don't worry about that.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.051
I'll tell her.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.193
-Yeah.
-See what I'm talking about?

24:47.360 --> 24:48.569
That was dope.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.363
Yeah, that was dope,
but you really think we can do this?

24:51.740 --> 24:53.324
We have to.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.909
I wanna win this thing.

24:55.076 --> 24:57.995
Yeah, so do l,
but I'd at least like to walk away...

24:58.163 --> 25:00.164
...with my ass in the same place
it is now.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.500
Then we better get started.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.628
Come on, y'all.

25:08.590 --> 25:12.092
It's 6:30. If you don't leave, you'll be
late for your own award ceremony.

25:12.260 --> 25:15.596
I told Yuson not to be late.
He knows how important this is to me.

25:15.764 --> 25:18.933
I'm sure he's just running behind
like he always is.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.477
Why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll wait for Yuson.

25:21.645 --> 25:25.105
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I want you to get good seats.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.690
-Okay.
-Okay.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.275
-See you, sweetie.
-Bye, Daddy.

25:28.443 --> 25:30.653
-We'll see you there.
-Bye.

25:37.869 --> 25:41.413
That's it. Yeah.
Good work, guys. Keep it up.

25:50.715 --> 25:53.008
There you go, yeah.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.714
I don't know about y'all,
but I'm ready to keep going.

26:31.881 --> 26:34.174
Don't look at me. I'm done.

26:34.342 --> 26:35.509
Come on, man.

26:35.677 --> 26:38.012
We seriously need to call it a night.

26:38.179 --> 26:42.016
-Yeah, that's what l'm talking about.
-All right, let's chill at the diner.

26:42.183 --> 26:44.476
Weren't you supposed
to meet up with Maya tonight?

26:44.644 --> 26:46.895
Oh, damn. Yo, l gotta bounce.

26:47.063 --> 26:49.648
Bro, you know you're not gonna be
getting any tonight.

26:49.816 --> 26:53.110
-So you might as well hang with us.
-Whatever.

27:00.410 --> 27:03.621
I'm sorry, babe. I messed up
and no excuse is gonna change that.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.914
Are you saying
you don't have an excuse?

27:06.082 --> 27:07.666
Of course I do.

27:08.668 --> 27:10.210
I'm waiting.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.840
Justin had his boys show the crew
some dope moves...

27:15.008 --> 27:16.592
...and l got all caught up in it.

27:19.596 --> 27:23.515
So you chose to hang out with
your crew instead of being with me...

27:23.683 --> 27:27.019
...even after l told you how important
this award ceremony was to me?

27:27.187 --> 27:28.228
I should've been there.

27:28.396 --> 27:30.648
-l'll make it up to you.
-You always say that.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.483
Babe, hold up.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.985
Look, tomorrow night,
I'll take you out to dinner.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.404
It will be our own celebration,
just me and you.

27:37.572 --> 27:38.906
How's that sound?

27:39.074 --> 27:40.991
I can't tomorrow. l got work to do.

27:42.243 --> 27:43.994
You have more work?

27:44.162 --> 27:46.330
I got a lot of forms to fill out.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.085
I'm transferring to UBC in the fall.

27:51.252 --> 27:54.546
What? Wait, UBC?
That's on the other side of the country.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.340
But they have a great program.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.760
So, what, you're just gonna pick up
and leave me behind?

27:59.928 --> 28:03.263
It's not like you couldn't have been
coming with me to school.

28:07.602 --> 28:10.312
I didn't graduate valedictorian
like you.

28:10.480 --> 28:14.108
So no one's
handing me scholarships.

28:14.275 --> 28:15.943
Hip-hop is my only way there.

28:17.987 --> 28:22.866
You've been saying that since
high school and you're still saying that.

28:23.618 --> 28:25.285
When did you stop believing in me?

28:25.453 --> 28:27.621
I didn't say that.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.039
I believe in you.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.542
Yo, hold up, hold up.
What's going on?

28:32.460 --> 28:34.128
Nothing is going on.

28:34.295 --> 28:37.297
This whole transferring school thing
isn't for a better program.

28:37.465 --> 28:42.720
-lt's because you're done with me.
-Everything is about you.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.806
I've been wanting to go to UBC
from the very beginning.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.976
I am here because of you.

28:50.270 --> 28:54.314
But after tonight, l realized that l need
to start doing what's right for me.

28:54.482 --> 28:57.109
And if that means leaving
you behind...

28:57.277 --> 28:59.611
...well, that's what
I'm gonna have to do.

29:01.322 --> 29:03.323
You're dumping my ass.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.034
I'm sorry.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.371
So am l.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.183
That was fast.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.351
She broke up with me.

29:32.687 --> 29:35.105
You were too good for her anyway.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.857
That's between me and Maya.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.111
Look, bro, don't even sweat it, man.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.529
Y'all will work that out.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.240
Hey.

29:45.408 --> 29:47.367
There's a battle tomorrow night
at the Pit.

29:47.535 --> 29:50.621
-l say we go lay some parkour on them.
-Yeah, I'm up for that.

29:50.830 --> 29:53.290
We're keeping that under wraps
until the competition.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.876
Man, it's not like any of the crews
at the Pit...

29:56.044 --> 29:58.045
...are gonna be competing at
Beat the World.

29:58.213 --> 30:01.882
All it takes is for some kid to get a video
on his cell and post it on YouTube.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.218
Some crew from China
shows up doing our moves.

30:04.385 --> 30:06.053
Now that's some paranoid shit.

30:06.846 --> 30:09.640
Man, let's just go to the club
and have some fun.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.476
Is that all you think about,
is partying?

30:12.644 --> 30:14.895
Go home, get some sleep,
so that tomorrow...

30:15.063 --> 30:18.232
...your ass is up on the rooftop,
ready to work on our damn routine.

30:19.359 --> 30:23.237
Hey, I know you're hurting over Maya,
but don't take it out on your crew.

30:23.404 --> 30:25.405
The only thing on my mind now
is winning.

30:25.573 --> 30:28.909
Come on.
Don't try to sell me that bullshit.

30:29.077 --> 30:32.079
Maya dumped your ass.
Now you're acting like a little bitch.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.583
What did you say?

30:37.502 --> 30:40.921
Come on, we family.
Don't be like that.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.430
Yo, bro, hold on.

30:52.809 --> 30:56.603
Bro, listen.
I'm just riding you to make a point.

30:57.647 --> 31:02.109
Maya's messing with your head.
You gotta man up, move on.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.611
Sounds like shit you write
on a recruitment poster.

31:04.779 --> 31:05.821
Call it what you want.

31:05.989 --> 31:08.532
Have you ever seen me let a shorty
get inside my head?

31:10.743 --> 31:12.661
Have you ever been in love?

31:16.666 --> 31:19.501
I'm not even having this conversation.
You just tripping.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.213
You don't even know what
I'm talking about.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.884
I'll tell you what l'm gonna do.

31:27.051 --> 31:30.304
I'm gonna put a call in to Oprah
and see if l can get you on her show.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.514
That's not funny.

31:32.682 --> 31:36.059
And if we can't get you on Oprah,
then we do Dr. Phil.

31:36.978 --> 31:40.814
I know he's white, but that's
Oprah's boy, so he can't be that bad.

31:42.483 --> 31:43.942
Later.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.522
You okay?

33:47.608 --> 33:50.777
-How long you been there?
-Long enough to know you're suicidal.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.612
Could've broken your neck.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.615
Just trying some new moves,
that's all.

33:55.783 --> 33:58.660
Or maybe you're trying
to take your mind off Maya.

34:03.958 --> 34:06.334
Only thing on my mind now
is winning Beat the World.

34:06.502 --> 34:09.670
And you think if you win,
she'll take you back.

34:10.297 --> 34:13.382
She's gonna do what she has to do
and l'm gonna do what I gotta do.

34:17.929 --> 34:20.264
I'm gonna practice.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.726
So should you.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.310
Don't you ever use the stairs?

35:05.478 --> 35:06.853
Not if l can help it.

35:56.028 --> 35:57.904
Yo, what's up, man?

36:01.868 --> 36:03.743
Are you sure this is the right hotel?

36:04.245 --> 36:06.955
Thought your cousin
was supposed to be looking out for us.

36:07.123 --> 36:08.665
It looked better in the picture.

36:08.833 --> 36:14.171
Come on, guys. We're here
and that's all that matters, right?

36:24.557 --> 36:25.849
Here.

36:54.295 --> 36:55.629
Thanks.

37:02.011 --> 37:04.596
Yuson, are you sure
we're in the right line?

37:04.764 --> 37:07.766
The crews there are just walking up
to that desk and checking in.

37:07.934 --> 37:10.143
That desk is for crews
with sponsors.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.187
Man, that don't even sound right
to me.

37:12.647 --> 37:13.813
Lines mean nothing.

37:13.981 --> 37:17.400
They all have to get on that stage
and battle just like the rest of us.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.071
Who the hell are they?

37:21.239 --> 37:24.366
That's Eric and his crew, Flying Steps.
They're from Germany.

37:24.533 --> 37:27.786
Is that him?
He looks taller in the video.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.165
-Look, he even got his own workshop.
-That's wack.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.751
Who's gonna sign up
and take lessons from this dude?

37:40.383 --> 37:42.092
Hey, what's good?

37:42.468 --> 37:44.719
Just wanna shake the hand
of last year's champion.

37:44.887 --> 37:46.513
Sure, it's my pleasure.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.431
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.518
I also want you to get a chance
to meet this year's champion.

37:51.686 --> 37:54.020
We go by the name of Fusion.

38:01.112 --> 38:04.197
-Looks like you got a new crew.
-Yeah.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.700
I really hope they're better
than your last crew.

38:07.618 --> 38:08.660
Don't sweat it.

38:08.828 --> 38:12.163
If you wanna give yourself a chance,
you can come to my workshop.

38:12.331 --> 38:14.499
You wanna step up?
I'll school you right here.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.377
Make it to the finals...

38:17.545 --> 38:19.671
-...you get your chance.
-Yeah, I'll be there.

38:19.839 --> 38:24.259
Better be ready
to get your ass kicked again.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.764
I can't wait to kick his ass
in the final.

38:29.932 --> 38:31.433
Yeah, we gotta get there first.

38:45.698 --> 38:48.658
Give it a break, man.
She's with her boyfriend.

38:49.577 --> 38:52.495
-That's not her boyfriend.
-Now, how do you know that?

38:52.663 --> 38:54.831
Trust me, she's not feeling him.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.250
Oh, so, what,
now you're a mind reader?

38:59.086 --> 39:00.795
Did you see that?

39:00.963 --> 39:02.714
I didn't see nothing.

39:03.799 --> 39:05.717
She gave me the green light.

39:05.885 --> 39:08.261
She probably had something stuck
in her eye.

39:10.514 --> 39:14.351
Yo, man, come on,
don't make a fool of yourself.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.645
Just because you don't know
how to read women.

39:19.190 --> 39:23.026
Damn. Man, that could've been
the mother of my children.

39:34.955 --> 39:36.873
Easy, here's your pass, man.

39:38.292 --> 39:40.001
Easy, you with me?

39:40.461 --> 39:42.003
Check it out. lt's my girl.

39:43.089 --> 39:45.340
-Okay.
-Oh, now she's your girl?

39:45.508 --> 39:48.093
I told you she was feeling me.

39:48.260 --> 39:52.555
-Looks like she's got her own crew too.
-Come on. Tell me that isn't a sign.

39:52.723 --> 39:56.309
It means she's our competition.
So stay focused on what we gotta do.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.853
Don't l always handle my business?

40:11.992 --> 40:13.868
What's with Carlos?

40:14.995 --> 40:16.996
Hey. You all right?

40:17.915 --> 40:19.624
We need to talk.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.462
This guy would only give me the money
if l paid him double the interest.

40:24.630 --> 40:27.924
I told him we would win the competition
and they would get their money.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.884
How much money?

40:30.052 --> 40:32.178
Forty thousand dollars.

40:35.933 --> 40:39.394
One hundred thousand, first prize.
That still leaves us with 60,000.

40:39.562 --> 40:40.854
What were you thinking?

40:41.772 --> 40:43.731
I had to,
or we wouldn't have made it here.

40:43.899 --> 40:47.694
The favela is full of drugs and gangs.
You know dancing is our only way out.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.904
And you throw our money away
on a stupid bet?

40:50.072 --> 40:53.032
-l'm sorry. I messed up.
-"l messed up"?

40:53.200 --> 40:55.201
You know how hard
we worked for that money.

40:55.369 --> 40:59.372
How can you do this to me?
To all of us?

40:59.540 --> 41:01.332
I'm sorry, Olivia.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.127
Come on.
We gotta go tell the others.

41:08.466 --> 41:11.342
Hey, yo, Detroit City.
Are y'all ready to rock?

41:11.510 --> 41:14.679
Let's see
who's gonna beat the world!

41:15.347 --> 41:17.891
Hey, yo, bust it.
We got over 20 countries...

41:18.058 --> 41:20.143
...representing around the world
here tonight.

41:20.311 --> 41:23.521
But y'all already know, it doesn't
matter what language you speak.

41:23.689 --> 41:26.649
The language of hip-hop is universal.
You know what l'm saying?

41:28.027 --> 41:30.528
The rules for tonight
are real simple.

41:30.696 --> 41:35.283
Each crew will get three minutes to
show the judges exactly what they got.

41:35.451 --> 41:39.412
Then the five crews with the highest
score are gonna come back tomorrow...

41:39.580 --> 41:45.376
...and throw down for the top prize
of $1 00,000. You know what I mean?

41:46.253 --> 41:48.087
All right, let's do this, yo.

48:46.840 --> 48:49.675
Damn. They're good.

49:39.309 --> 49:41.519
It's time for
what we've all been waiting for.

49:41.687 --> 49:44.063
The judges have tabulated
their scores.

49:44.231 --> 49:47.066
Show some love for the five crews
who have made it to the top:

49:47.234 --> 49:49.318
Gogo Brothers.

49:50.237 --> 49:51.278
The One.

49:52.072 --> 49:53.572
Revolution.

49:53.740 --> 49:56.200
Fusion and the Flying Steps.

49:56.368 --> 49:58.577
They'll be back tomorrow
competing in the final.

49:58.745 --> 50:00.788
That was brilliant.

50:04.084 --> 50:05.918
You okay?

50:06.086 --> 50:07.670
You see Maya?

50:07.838 --> 50:09.255
No.

50:10.257 --> 50:11.924
Hey, look, man, don't sweat it.

50:12.592 --> 50:15.594
We got more work to do, all right?

50:24.312 --> 50:26.439
-Hello.
-Hey, baby.

50:26.606 --> 50:30.776
I'm not just saying this, but you know,
I think we could really win this thing.

50:30.944 --> 50:33.946
Well, that's what you always wanted,
a world title.

50:34.406 --> 50:36.824
What l want is you to be there
with me when l win.

50:39.911 --> 50:41.454
What's the point?

50:41.621 --> 50:44.206
I've been battling in the streets
since you met me.

50:44.374 --> 50:47.793
Finally have a chance to prove
I'm legit and you won't even be there.

50:51.006 --> 50:53.966
Later tonight, there's a Beat the World
party at Phosphorus.

50:54.134 --> 50:55.968
It's gonna be ill.

50:56.386 --> 51:00.389
-Come by and we can chill beforehand.
-Okay, Yuson, we're over.

51:00.557 --> 51:03.976
Okay, thank God I'm moving to the
West Coast, because l can't take this.

51:04.144 --> 51:06.145
Maybe you picked the wrong time
to break up.

51:08.023 --> 51:10.566
My phone is beeping.
I have to take this call.

51:10.734 --> 51:12.318
Who's calling that's so important?

51:12.486 --> 51:15.988
You're not my boyfriend anymore,
so that's none of your business.

51:17.240 --> 51:19.241
Yeah, you made that real clear.

52:29.771 --> 52:32.898
Maya's gotta be a fool
to give this up.

52:47.956 --> 52:49.582
I can't do this.

52:49.749 --> 52:52.418
You wanna run that by me again?

52:52.794 --> 52:55.671
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have called you.

52:56.089 --> 52:58.883
But l can't do this
when all l think about is Maya.

52:59.593 --> 53:02.469
That's what l'm here for,
to help you get over her.

53:02.637 --> 53:04.096
But then l'd just be using you.

53:04.264 --> 53:07.933
I'm fine with that.
That's how most relationships start.

53:33.627 --> 53:34.668
Maya.

53:37.589 --> 53:39.715
If you're thinking about making
a booty call...

53:39.883 --> 53:44.261
...l'd take a rain check,
because that man is spent.

54:17.671 --> 54:19.004
-What's up?
-Deray.

54:19.339 --> 54:20.381
Hey.

54:20.548 --> 54:23.008
-How you doing, man, you all right?
-Yeah, man.

54:23.176 --> 54:24.760
-Easy, what's up, man?
-What up?

54:24.928 --> 54:26.220
What's up?

54:27.389 --> 54:28.931
Well, where you been?

54:29.307 --> 54:31.183
Just taking care of business,
that's all.

54:31.351 --> 54:35.104
Cherry didn't come either.
Where's the team spirit at?

54:47.117 --> 54:50.035
Yo, those African brothers got game.

54:59.546 --> 55:02.381
Yo, Yuson.

55:05.135 --> 55:06.677
Where you at?

55:15.687 --> 55:17.062
Damn.

56:32.305 --> 56:33.514
Just look around.

56:33.681 --> 56:36.475
Man, there's plenty of shorties
out there.

56:36.935 --> 56:38.560
I gotta talk to her.

56:39.562 --> 56:41.021
When you said Maya dumped you...

56:41.189 --> 56:43.816
...you didn't tell me
she was taking your balls with her.

56:44.859 --> 56:47.486
Man, what the hell does she think
she's doing over there?

56:47.654 --> 56:48.987
You gotta let it go.

56:49.155 --> 56:51.323
You're setting a bad example
for your peeps.

56:51.491 --> 56:52.658
Hey, Easy's right.

56:53.159 --> 56:56.829
The more attention you show her,
the more she's just gonna carry on.

57:00.834 --> 57:02.709
It's time for me
to make my move now.

57:03.211 --> 57:05.254
You're trying to school me,
and look at you.

57:05.422 --> 57:08.674
You keep on that girl, she'll get
a restraining order against you.

57:09.134 --> 57:12.803
Did it ever occur to you she might
have came here looking for me?

57:12.971 --> 57:14.638
I doubt that.

57:17.016 --> 57:19.977
Excuse me, ladies. All right.

58:39.432 --> 58:40.474
What's up, sweetie?

58:40.642 --> 58:43.101
-l'm Olivia.
-l'm Easy.

58:43.603 --> 58:45.604
Really? Well, l'm not.

58:45.772 --> 58:47.814
No, no, no. My name is Easy.

58:48.566 --> 58:50.651
Well, not my real name.

58:50.818 --> 58:52.110
You can call me Ty.

58:53.821 --> 58:56.448
-l like Easy.
-l like Olivia.

58:59.369 --> 59:01.620
Looks like Easy's
already working his game.

59:01.788 --> 59:04.957
Ask me and I think Easy's
the one who's gonna get played.

59:20.974 --> 59:23.392
I don't think l should go.

59:23.810 --> 59:26.061
Come on.
I told you we can party at my hotel.

59:26.229 --> 59:29.147
Yeah, but l just--
I really don't think l should.

59:29.315 --> 59:32.317
-You told me you wanted to go.
-Yeah, but I don't--

59:32.485 --> 59:34.820
I don't know what
I'm saying right now. I'm sorry.

59:34.988 --> 59:37.489
Yeah, it's all right, baby.
I'll take care of you.

59:37.657 --> 59:40.492
Don't you know that when a woman
says no, it means no?

59:40.660 --> 59:43.996
Now, don't be a sore loser.
Better get out of my way.

59:44.163 --> 59:46.665
I don't think you heard me.
She's not going with you.

59:49.752 --> 59:51.003
Come on.

59:54.924 --> 59:57.509
Yuson. Yuson, come on, man.

59:57.677 --> 01:00:00.345
-Chill, chill, chill.
-Break it up.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:03.223
Let it go.

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:10.272
I'm out of here.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.857
Maya, l'm taking you home.

01:00:12.358 --> 01:00:14.693
I can take care of myself.

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:19.675
I knew l'd find you here.

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:22.427
You're so disciplined.

01:01:37.276 --> 01:01:38.860
What happened to you?

01:01:40.279 --> 01:01:41.488
I fell.

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:43.949
Is that what the rest of the crew
will say?

01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:45.867
Come on, Nina, don't be like that.

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:48.286
Looks like you were in a fight.

01:01:48.454 --> 01:01:50.747
Bet it was over a girl.

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:55.669
If you want somebody to comfort you,
it won't be me.

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:57.045
Nina.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:00.674
-Eric, I think you should leave.
-Please.

01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:02.676
I'm done.

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:13.979
Are you forgetting that l'm the one
who taught you how to dance?

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:18.024
This was my show to choreograph
and you stole it from me.

01:02:18.192 --> 01:02:19.401
So we're even.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:23.155
Why should Martin let you choreograph
our biggest show of the year?

01:02:23.322 --> 01:02:25.991
Unless, of course,
you're sleeping with him.

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:28.493
I love it when you get mad.
That's so sexy.

01:02:29.954 --> 01:02:31.329
You're such an asshole, man.

01:02:38.504 --> 01:02:41.465
Oh, Nina,
if you change your mind...

01:02:41.632 --> 01:02:43.925
...you know l'd always
take you back.

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:04.196
-Hello.
-What was that show about...

01:03:04.363 --> 01:03:06.031
...you was putting on last night?

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:08.450
Obviously, you've moved on
and so have l.

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:11.328
You make it sound
like you're the one who was dumped.

01:03:11.996 --> 01:03:15.081
Yeah, well, you made your bed,
so lie in it.

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:18.627
Meaning?

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:23.715
Ask Cherry. l'm sure she'll be happy
to explain it to you.

01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:34.017
Where's everybody at?

01:03:34.727 --> 01:03:36.686
Don't we got practice?

01:03:37.396 --> 01:03:39.981
You're early for a change.

01:03:40.733 --> 01:03:42.234
That's because I'm a new man.

01:03:44.278 --> 01:03:47.572
Finally, l understand
why you're so twisted over Maya.

01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:51.576
-l just had the time of my life.
-No, you did not.

01:03:51.744 --> 01:03:54.996
-With that girl from the Brazilian crew?
-Her name is Olivia.

01:03:55.164 --> 01:04:00.585
And yeah, I'm talking the whole night
through till the sun came up.

01:04:00.753 --> 01:04:03.505
She must have been something
to keep you there all night.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.550
Man, l thought you were
more evolved.

01:04:06.717 --> 01:04:09.719
We spent the whole night conversing,
getting to know one another.

01:04:09.887 --> 01:04:11.763
Okay, now you're just trying
to play me.

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:14.099
I'm saying, it's like you said.

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:17.644
Once you've been in love,
there's no going back.

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:21.356
Ever cross your mind that maybe
she's after you for something else?

01:04:22.149 --> 01:04:24.776
Listen. l can smell a gold digger...

01:04:24.944 --> 01:04:28.321
...like my cousin Tyrell can smell
bacon cooking four blocks away.

01:04:28.489 --> 01:04:32.200
And besides, l'm not representing
I'm made of cheese.

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:36.037
I'm actually the real on this one.

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:39.291
That's not what l'm talking about.

01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:45.130
Okay, well, then what would she be
after besides this premium package?

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.301
Immigration papers.

01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:55.891
You better take that back...

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:59.519
...or the next time you be dancing,
it'll be on your ass...

01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:04.190
...because I'll break both your legs off
at the knees.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:09.487
Easy? You're early.

01:05:09.655 --> 01:05:11.323
I'm in love. What's it to you?

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:15.035
Let's go up top.
We got some work to do.

01:05:15.202 --> 01:05:17.329
-Right.
-What's up, man?

01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:19.873
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:25.170
-Can you help me out with something?
-Sure.

01:05:25.838 --> 01:05:27.964
I was just talking to Maya
and she said:

01:05:28.132 --> 01:05:31.217
"You made your bed,
so now you have to lie in it."

01:05:31.385 --> 01:05:34.763
I asked her what she meant by that.
She said, "Why don't you ask Cherry?"

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:36.640
Now, why would she say that?

01:05:37.516 --> 01:05:40.936
Maybe because she thinks
there's something between us.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.730
We've already been through this.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:53.031
-You still can't get her out of your head.
-And even if l could...

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:56.368
...that doesn't mean something
is gonna happen between us.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:03.917
I hope this doesn't get in the way
of our dancing together.

01:06:04.835 --> 01:06:06.252
I need to win this.

01:06:14.553 --> 01:06:17.097
Hey, yo, what up, y'all?
You know what's going down.

01:06:17.264 --> 01:06:20.266
Welcome back to day two
of the competition.

01:06:20.434 --> 01:06:22.394
It's the finals!

01:06:29.735 --> 01:06:32.737
Five, six, seven, eight, okay?

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:36.157
Hey, you okay?

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:38.868
Yeah, yeah, l'm good.

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:41.371
Okay, what's wrong?

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:50.255
The way l see it,
Carlos is the one who lost your money.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:53.258
So it's on him to pay back
the loan shark.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.552
I know Carlos made a big mistake.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.930
But in Brazil,
you treat your crew like family.

01:07:00.766 --> 01:07:02.767
Then you just gotta go in there
and win.

01:07:05.229 --> 01:07:08.857
I'm so nervous.
It's gonna be hard to pull it off.

01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:13.486
When I'm feeling tense,
I go for a nice long walk...

01:07:13.654 --> 01:07:16.448
...and focus on my breathing.
Give it a try.

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:20.994
Come on, l'll walk with you.

01:07:21.162 --> 01:07:22.704
Don't you have to get ready?

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:25.123
I'm not leaving you like this.

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:27.333
And when you're out there
doing your thing...

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:29.961
...l'm gonna be right there
watching you put it down.

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.297
Thanks.

01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:46.394
Give it up for the first
of our five finalists...

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:49.272
...Revolution!

01:09:41.385 --> 01:09:44.261
-Nervous?
-No, I'm good.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:48.265
You should be.
Doesn't get much bigger than this.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:51.352
Sure, l guess l'm feeling it.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.645
Yuson looks pretty worked up.

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:55.940
Like you said, it's a big deal.

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.526
I think it's more than
the competition.

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.236
Really?

01:10:00.404 --> 01:10:03.615
Yeah, he keeps calling Maya.
She won't pick up.

01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:05.575
It's getting to him.

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:07.911
Yeah, it's a shame about them.

01:10:09.288 --> 01:10:13.124
See, l can't help but notice
that every time Yuson grabs his cell...

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:16.044
...you get this strange look
on your face...

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:19.047
...like you've done something
you shouldn't have.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.674
Maybe I just feel sorry for him.

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:24.761
See, the look I saw...

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:28.473
...looks more like the mouse
who hid the last piece of cheese...

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:30.433
...and she don't wanna share it.

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:34.354
And now the mouse is feeling
kind of guilty.

01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:36.564
Deray, you're tripping.

01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:43.363
I don't get into your business.
Don't get into mine.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:47.200
Check this out, Cherry.

01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:50.912
We get on that stage,
if Yuson's mind isn't in it...

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.082
...news flash, we all lose.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.960
So if you're holding on
to some precious piece of info...

01:10:57.127 --> 01:11:00.088
...that could dictate or influence
the outcome of events...

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:01.839
...now is your time to act.

01:12:56.747 --> 01:12:59.332
Yo, where were you?

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.960
-Had to take care of some business.
-Anything to do with Olivia?

01:13:03.962 --> 01:13:05.171
Yeah, she needed my help.

01:13:05.339 --> 01:13:07.340
If we're gonna win,
I need you focused.

01:13:07.508 --> 01:13:09.467
You know what your problem is?

01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:12.136
You're always thinking
about yourself.

01:13:12.304 --> 01:13:15.598
If you actually tried putting
somebody else first for a change...

01:13:15.766 --> 01:13:17.934
...maybe you'd still have Maya.

01:14:15.742 --> 01:14:17.827
Hey, if your guy's not here
in 1 0 minutes...

01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:19.954
...l have to put someone else
in your spot.

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:22.039
That's fine. We'll just go on later.

01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:25.751
Let's just do it.

01:14:25.919 --> 01:14:30.214
If we go out there without Yuson,
we're screwed.

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:49.192
Maya, it's Cherry.

01:14:49.359 --> 01:14:51.736
There's something l have to tell you.

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:54.906
Give it up for our third finalist,
The One!

01:15:29.107 --> 01:15:31.192
I know you're upset with me.

01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:36.280
But you can't let your emotions
get into the way of the routine.

01:15:36.448 --> 01:15:38.574
To be honest...

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:43.496
...l feel absolutely nothing for you,
and l like it that way.

01:15:45.832 --> 01:15:48.334
-l don't believe you.
-lt doesn't matter.

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:52.880
Because this is the last time
we're gonna dance together.

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:55.049
I'm starting my own crew.

01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:06.310
Yo, Fusion.

01:16:06.478 --> 01:16:08.646
I need you guys in the wings
in two minutes.

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:10.815
We waiting for one of our boys.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:13.568
If he's not here by then,
you'll have to forfeit.

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.528
-What?
-That's the rules.

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:20.992
-He'll be here.
-All right.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.121
Hey, yo, for all y'all hip-hop fans...

01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:27.707
...that like to kick it
with that European flavor...

01:16:27.874 --> 01:16:30.251
...this next crew is Europe's finest...

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:34.839
...and they're also the world reigning
hip-hop champions.

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:40.344
Make some noise for Flying Steps!

01:16:56.194 --> 01:16:58.529
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:00.573
How did it go with Maya?

01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:02.533
It didn't.

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:29.078
Come on, bro. This is your moment.

01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:31.247
You gotta get your mind
in the game.

01:18:31.415 --> 01:18:32.915
I know, man.

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:36.836
But without Maya,
it doesn't mean a thing.

01:18:37.003 --> 01:18:38.671
I really blew it.

01:18:38.839 --> 01:18:40.131
Did you really mean that?

01:18:45.929 --> 01:18:49.306
I know l can't expect you to be there
for me when I wasn't there for you.

01:18:49.474 --> 01:18:52.560
If you have to go to UBC,
I'll have your back on that.

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:54.687
They got dance crews
on the West Coast.

01:18:56.523 --> 01:18:57.982
You'd move there for me?

01:18:58.150 --> 01:18:59.650
That's what l'm saying.

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:02.236
I wanna be that best friend
you can always count on.

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:07.658
Even when you're old,
wrinkled and fat.

01:19:17.502 --> 01:19:20.713
Cheer, y'all! Y'all know how we do it
at Beat the World!

01:19:20.881 --> 01:19:25.301
Give some more love to Fusion!

01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:55.826
All right, the judges have come
to a final decision.

01:21:55.994 --> 01:21:58.037
Are you ready?

01:21:58.705 --> 01:22:03.542
The 201 0 Beat the World
champions are...

01:22:06.504 --> 01:22:10.841
...from across the bridge,
Windsor's Fusion!

01:22:39.537 --> 01:22:40.537
What was that for?

01:22:40.705 --> 01:22:44.667
Well, if it wasn't you, l wouldn't have
made it through the competition.

01:22:44.834 --> 01:22:46.043
What about the loan shark?

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:49.880
We'll just have to dance the samba
at the hotel until we pay the rest off.

01:22:50.715 --> 01:22:52.716
I always wanted to learn samba.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.057
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:23:01.559 --> 01:23:03.435
Hey, Yuson.

01:23:04.688 --> 01:23:07.481
You said you were going
to school me?

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:09.191
I just did.

01:23:09.359 --> 01:23:11.568
Without your crew, you're nothing.

01:23:11.736 --> 01:23:13.570
You challenging me one-on-one?

01:23:17.742 --> 01:23:19.034
Let's do it.

01:24:44.162 --> 01:24:45.996
Oh, that's right.

01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:09.561
Now you've been schooled.
