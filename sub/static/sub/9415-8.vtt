00:06.445 --> 00:07.712
I'm gonna miss you.

00:07.713 --> 00:11.549
During the week, I was home
with the kids by myself.

00:11.550 --> 00:15.887
It was only woods for
as far as you could see.

00:15.888 --> 00:18.289
It's not there now, but it's out there.

00:18.290 --> 00:19.290
[Gunshot]

00:19.291 --> 00:22.193
Surely you heard the rumors
of what happened at that house.

00:22.194 --> 00:23.795
She called it a rumor.

00:23.796 --> 00:26.208
Stay away from him.

00:26.209 --> 00:27.932
He's the bad man.

00:27.933 --> 00:30.935
I felt she was there to protect me.

00:30.936 --> 00:33.404
I should have believed him.

00:33.405 --> 00:35.439
Whatever was there...

00:35.440 --> 00:36.674
[Dog barking]

00:36.675 --> 00:40.278
Whatever was hurting my
family was getting stronger.

00:40.279 --> 00:42.446
I'm just thinking if that
happened to one of my kids.

00:42.447 --> 00:44.315

00:44.316 --> 00:46.785

_.

01:13.512 --> 01:15.680
Slanesville just kind of happened.

01:15.681 --> 01:18.430
I just wanted to get out of the city.

01:18.431 --> 01:20.985
I didn't want the city
influence on my kids.

01:20.986 --> 01:23.121
Thank you very much.

01:23.122 --> 01:26.590
Slanesville was real country.
It was... it was hick.

01:26.591 --> 01:28.226
Good old boys.

01:28.227 --> 01:32.063
But hard to fit in if
you were from out of town.

01:32.064 --> 01:37.668
It's just a town that you're gonna
pass if you're going somewhere.

01:37.669 --> 01:39.337
Brian got me a dog.

01:39.338 --> 01:41.105
We named her Coco.

01:41.106 --> 01:44.108
The children love her,
and she loved the kids.

01:44.109 --> 01:45.810
Don't give Coco too many treats.

01:45.811 --> 01:46.811
One's enough.

01:46.812 --> 01:49.180
She is gonna become a fat dog.

01:49.181 --> 01:52.301
But even though she was my
mom's dog, I loved her a lot.

01:52.302 --> 01:57.162
She was very protective
over the whole family.

01:59.091 --> 02:01.730
It was very important
to both Brian and I,

02:01.731 --> 02:04.467
that the kids grow up
in a safe environment.

02:04.468 --> 02:06.364
The house was perfect.

02:06.365 --> 02:10.335
It was a fair-sized ranch
back in the middle of nowhere.

02:10.336 --> 02:12.737
There was nothing else around you.

02:12.738 --> 02:13.872
Yeah, Coco!

02:13.873 --> 02:16.074
Every direction you
looked in, there was woods.

02:16.075 --> 02:18.519
- Hey, love.
- How's it going out here?

02:18.520 --> 02:21.045
It's going well. Have
this up in no time.

02:21.046 --> 02:24.615
Seemed like it was gonna be
a real nice place to live.

02:24.616 --> 02:26.650
Could let my kids play and go wander.

02:26.651 --> 02:31.751
Don't have to worry about
somebody snatching 'em.

02:31.823 --> 02:33.557

<i>The end zone for a touchdown!</i>

02:35.394 --> 02:36.427

02:36.428 --> 02:41.465
This is the bathroom, Shaun's
room, and the living room.

02:41.466 --> 02:42.666
This is so nice.

02:42.667 --> 02:46.675
Shortly after we moved in to the house,
my brother came to visit with his family.

02:46.676 --> 02:50.947
And then this beautiful piece
of work is Brian's doing.

02:50.948 --> 02:53.470
Apparently, we need a new door frame.

02:53.471 --> 02:57.284
Belinda and I actually went
to junior high school together.

02:57.285 --> 02:59.609
So I've known her for a long time.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.068
And then this here is the...

03:01.069 --> 03:03.048
The house in Slanesville was...

03:03.049 --> 03:06.188
I thought it was awesome because
I was coming from the city.

03:06.189 --> 03:08.535
Toys in the yard, toys on the floor.

03:08.536 --> 03:09.592
Kid-friendly.

03:09.593 --> 03:12.880
Didn't have any inkling that it was
any different than any other house.

03:12.881 --> 03:15.341
Make a wish.

03:16.001 --> 03:18.515
We decided to have a birthday party.

03:18.516 --> 03:22.012
We were celebrating
my cousin's birthday.

03:22.013 --> 03:27.913
My niece, Jordan, was sitting on
the floor, playing with some toys.

03:29.263 --> 03:32.995
All of a sudden, I noticed
that one of the balloons,

03:32.996 --> 03:36.416
the string pulled straight.

03:36.791 --> 03:40.511
As if somebody was holding it.

03:44.596 --> 03:50.496
It was floating in midair like as
if someone was holding the string.

03:54.859 --> 03:58.577
It just moved across the damn room.

03:58.578 --> 04:04.478
My cousin, Jordan, whose birthday it was,
I noticed the balloon going towards her.

04:06.418 --> 04:08.853
My sister and I just
looked at each other.

04:08.854 --> 04:12.706
She looked at me and said, did
you see that balloon follow her?

04:12.707 --> 04:14.627
Yeah.

04:15.294 --> 04:18.296
Jordan did not touch that balloon.

04:18.297 --> 04:22.257
That balloon made its way to her.

04:28.777 --> 04:32.234
When the balloon
stopped in front of her.

04:32.235 --> 04:36.915
She looked up as if
she saw someone there.

04:37.613 --> 04:39.767
Like a child.

04:39.768 --> 04:44.928
You know, like she was
playing with another child.

04:46.558 --> 04:50.338
Once she reached for it, and...

04:51.245 --> 04:55.265
It just floated up to the ceiling.

04:58.782 --> 05:02.762
The way the balloon
rested in front of Jordan.

05:02.763 --> 05:05.643
And her reaction...

05:06.146 --> 05:08.966
It wasn't normal.

05:15.720 --> 05:19.787
Back in '91, I used to...
or I still am a big hunter...

05:19.788 --> 05:23.827
I eat what I kill, and that
was a big part of our diet.

05:23.828 --> 05:26.716
Heck, I could hunt in the back yard.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.569
I was a daddy's girl.

05:28.570 --> 05:30.879
There was this one day.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.924
My dad asks, like, hey, do you
want to go squirrel hunting?

05:33.925 --> 05:37.189
So I get her all dressed
up. We get the .22 out.

05:37.190 --> 05:38.512
All right, let's try right here.

05:38.513 --> 05:43.016
We went up over the hill at the back
of the house where there was just woods.

05:43.017 --> 05:46.017
Everywhere was woods.

05:50.089 --> 05:51.604
You know, there's nothing.

05:51.605 --> 05:54.785
No movement, no sounds.

05:55.336 --> 05:58.756
The woods are, like, dead.

05:59.309 --> 06:00.314
[Tree branch snaps]

06:00.315 --> 06:03.119
And then all of a
sudden, I hear something.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.941
I look over, and... squirrel!

06:05.942 --> 06:07.638
Yay, it's a squirrel.

06:07.639 --> 06:10.410
So you're gonna run around
the back of that tree...

06:10.411 --> 06:13.245
It's on the wrong side of the
tree, so I try to tell her to go

06:13.246 --> 06:19.146
to the other side of the tree
to run it back over to this side.

06:22.271 --> 06:27.671
And as I'm chasing it, I
go up this little mound...

06:28.254 --> 06:31.854
And I'm like, what is this?

06:37.702 --> 06:40.238
Blaire! Blaire!

06:40.239 --> 06:43.899
In front of me was this van.

06:46.645 --> 06:52.023
It was as if it had crashed, which
doesn't make any sense because...

06:52.024 --> 06:55.278
There's no roads around.

06:55.279 --> 06:58.519
All burned and beat up.

06:59.260 --> 07:04.662
You know? I could tell that the
van had been there for a long time.

07:04.663 --> 07:07.903
I came up to the back.

07:08.733 --> 07:13.593
There was a mattress
in the back of the van.

07:14.140 --> 07:19.300
I had, like, this sinking
feeling in my stomach...

07:21.383 --> 07:24.623
Like this wasn't right.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.135
Let's go.

07:28.136 --> 07:33.488
You know, he looks at it real quick,
and he grabs me, and he says, let's go.

07:33.489 --> 07:36.195
And just by his body language, I
could tell he was like, you know...

07:36.196 --> 07:41.221
This isn't good, you know?
I don't want you seeing this.

07:41.222 --> 07:47.122
It was ominous. Well, why is there
a charred van behind my house?

07:50.809 --> 07:52.476
By trade, I was a carpenter.

07:52.477 --> 07:54.896
I had recently just
started this new job.

07:54.897 --> 07:58.846
I was working at Goddard Flight Center
down in Greenbelt, Maryland, AKA, NASA.

07:58.847 --> 08:00.378
Office renovation.

08:00.379 --> 08:04.788
I actually did the Hubble Space
Telescope room, which was kind of cool.

08:04.789 --> 08:08.509
Uh, but the drive was immense.

08:08.893 --> 08:11.696
Be a good boy, all right?
You can do that for me?

08:11.697 --> 08:14.257
It's what most people
did because, you know,

08:14.258 --> 08:17.841
there's no work in West Virginia, and
a lot of us travel up and down the road.

08:17.842 --> 08:20.471

- I miss you.

08:20.472 --> 08:26.372
Brian would stay with his mother during
the week and come home on the weekends.

08:26.911 --> 08:29.431
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:29.815 --> 08:35.414
During the week, I was home by
myself with no way to get anywhere.

08:35.414 --> 08:38.947
But we'd always lived in remote areas.

08:38.948 --> 08:44.848
And I wasn't afraid to be by myself,
because that's the way things were.

08:57.965 --> 09:03.607
I had been begging my mom to go camping
because my dad was in the city like normal.

09:03.608 --> 09:06.792
And so she finally agreed
that I could go camping,

09:06.793 --> 09:10.221
but I had to go in the yard
and outside her bedroom window

09:10.222 --> 09:12.956
so she could still keep an eye on me.

09:12.957 --> 09:16.146
I wasn't real keen on the idea at first.

09:16.147 --> 09:19.533
But she didn't have school
the next day, and she convinced

09:19.534 --> 09:24.243
me that she was going to be okay because
she was going to have Coco with her.

09:24.244 --> 09:27.361
I tucked her in before I went to bed,

09:27.362 --> 09:32.582

she was perfectly content.

be afraid of anything.

he refused to go to bed.

10:06.758 --> 10:08.798
Come on, buddy. It's time to go to bed.

10:08.799 --> 10:11.837
He didn't want the lights off.

open. Then he wanted it open farther.

room before I turned it off.

10:24.044 --> 10:27.331

window, and she was out there.

maybe he was seeing an animal.

there was nothing out there.

the water bottle next to him.

didn't like being out there by herself.

[Crunching footsteps]

16:26.585 --> 16:27.385
[Door closes]

16:27.386 --> 16:30.866
I looked up. I was like...

16:31.297 --> 16:34.492
Oh, my goodness. There was this
little girl sitting in front of me.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.073
[Clock ticking]

16:43.077 --> 16:48.837
My bedroom door was shut, so
how did she get in my room?

16:53.345 --> 16:55.949
I did not feel threatened by her.

16:55.950 --> 16:59.062
I just tried to ignore her,
and maybe she would go away but,

16:59.063 --> 17:03.263
she just sat there, watching me play.

17:10.429 --> 17:11.796
You okay, Sweetie?

17:11.797 --> 17:13.330
Yeah.

17:13.332 --> 17:15.967
- Okay.
- [Giggles]

17:15.968 --> 17:20.771
I'm thinking maybe she
has an imaginary friend.

17:20.771 --> 17:26.412
I just thought that she was
just a child being a child.

17:26.478 --> 17:30.277
She would appear about the
same time every evening.

17:30.278 --> 17:33.017
This wasn't an imaginary friend.

17:33.018 --> 17:35.598
This was real.

17:57.262 --> 18:00.922
[TV audio plays in background]

18:02.223 --> 18:04.417
It was a Monday.

18:04.418 --> 18:08.248
I was pretty exhausted
by the end of the day.

18:08.249 --> 18:11.846
So I was settling in to bed...

18:11.847 --> 18:14.801
And had gone to sleep.

18:14.802 --> 18:18.582
And I started to have a dream.

18:26.223 --> 18:31.023
In the dream, I felt
something pinch my toe.

18:35.140 --> 18:37.703
There was a boy standing
at the foot of my bed,

18:37.704 --> 18:42.264
pinching me on the
toe with a clothespin.

19:06.160 --> 19:09.106
I said, "what's your name?"

19:09.107 --> 19:12.587
And he said, "I'm Andrew".

19:13.234 --> 19:17.434
I'm just letting you know I'm here.

19:22.508 --> 19:25.088
[Alarm buzzing]

19:28.817 --> 19:32.186
I woke up the next day thinking
it was all just a dream.

19:32.187 --> 19:34.088
Blaire, Shaun.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.277
It's time to get up.

19:35.278 --> 19:39.898
I went to throw the
blanket onto the bed.

19:40.989 --> 19:44.529
I look down at the floor...

19:48.007 --> 19:53.907
And there was a clothespin lying there
on the floor at the foot of the bed.

19:54.710 --> 20:00.610
All the clothespins were packed away
because we had a dryer at this house.

20:00.849 --> 20:03.606
I was trying to think of any reason

20:03.607 --> 20:08.023
why that clothespin could
be at the foot of my bed.

20:08.024 --> 20:12.644
And I couldn't think
of a logical answer.

20:12.795 --> 20:16.095
I remembered the dream...

20:19.005 --> 20:23.315
And I wondered at that moment
if it was really a dream,

20:23.316 --> 20:27.096
or if it had actually happened.

20:32.380 --> 20:36.389
One Sunday afternoon, my sister
offered to watch the kids for me

20:36.390 --> 20:39.487
for a bit so that I could
have some time to myself.

20:39.488 --> 20:44.828
I decided to take a little
stroll through the woods.

20:45.419 --> 20:50.039
I came across something,
that looked odd...

20:50.599 --> 20:55.459
There were some rocks,
but there was a fence.

20:59.027 --> 21:01.509
Those rocks were not rocks.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.510
They were headstones.

21:07.331 --> 21:11.336
The size of the headstones
indicated to me that

21:11.337 --> 21:14.548
the two large headstones
belonged to adults.

21:14.549 --> 21:18.567
And the small headstones
were for children.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.972
They were really old-looking.

21:20.973 --> 21:24.873
There weren't any names on them.

21:27.146 --> 21:30.887
You know, I thought
about the boy in my dream.

21:30.888 --> 21:36.788
I thought about the little girl that
my daughter claimed to be seeing.

21:38.128 --> 21:41.987
It made me wonder if
these gravestones...

21:41.988 --> 21:45.828
Had some connection to my house.

21:46.406 --> 21:49.071
If there was a family here before us.

21:49.072 --> 21:51.592
[Wind howling]

21:57.347 --> 22:02.952
That evening, I got this eerie
feeling like I was being watched.

22:02.953 --> 22:05.955
I did feel pretty exposed.

22:05.956 --> 22:11.856
There was only woods for as far as you
could see, and that feeling didn't go away.

22:17.300 --> 22:23.200
I went to bed, and as always, Coco would
follow me in and sleep on the bed with me.

22:23.254 --> 22:28.954
And that gave me some comfort
because Brian wasn't there.

22:47.130 --> 22:50.841
I remember being woken up by something.

22:50.842 --> 22:56.002
I notice that the curtain's
open, and it's dark.

23:02.997 --> 23:07.137
I stand up to go shut the curtains.

23:15.180 --> 23:18.067
Bam, there's this face.

23:18.068 --> 23:21.925
And I jump in bed, pull
the covers over my head.

23:21.926 --> 23:25.262
I'm just sitting there thinking, oh, my
goodness, oh, my goodness, oh, my goodness.

23:25.263 --> 23:28.569
I'm afraid that he's gonna come.

23:28.570 --> 23:31.030
[Dog barking]

23:31.834 --> 23:33.694
Shh.

23:33.841 --> 23:35.344
What's wrong, girl? Shh.

23:35.345 --> 23:39.933
I got up, and I looked out the
window to see if anyone was out there.

23:39.934 --> 23:41.729
Coco, I don't see anything.

23:41.730 --> 23:47.523
She seemed like she was barking
at nothing, so I got back into bed.

23:47.524 --> 23:48.914
[Dog chuffing]

23:48.915 --> 23:51.375
[Dog whining]

23:55.966 --> 24:01.137

of a sudden I feel this movement...

24:01.138 --> 24:03.358
[Creaking]

24:03.637 --> 24:08.815
And my heart starts racing,
and I'm like, what is this?

24:08.816 --> 24:12.776
I'm expecting it to be the face.

24:22.273 --> 24:23.953
_.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.640
_.

24:29.358 --> 24:35.258
I start to feel the covers
moving, and my heart starts racing.

24:41.537 --> 24:44.199
It was the little girl again.

24:44.200 --> 24:49.410
And this time, she spoke to me,
which she had never done before.

24:49.411 --> 24:51.045
Stay away from him.

24:51.046 --> 24:53.926
He's the bad man.

24:57.896 --> 25:02.562
I felt like she was there to just
help me and to be there to protect me.

25:34.217 --> 25:38.660
It felt as if something
was touching my hair.

25:38.661 --> 25:42.321
Shaun, please go back to bed.

25:45.467 --> 25:48.227
I felt it again.

25:49.625 --> 25:53.645
As if someone was breathing on me.

25:53.884 --> 25:56.344
[Dog barking]

25:57.023 --> 26:02.303
I turned the light on, but
there was nothing there.

26:02.940 --> 26:07.020
I couldn't be afraid, you know? I
was there with the kids by myself.

26:07.021 --> 26:12.061
And if I was afraid,
then they would be afraid.

26:17.453 --> 26:19.495
All right, kiddies, time
to say goodbye to Coco.

26:19.496 --> 26:22.124
- All: Bye, Coco.
- Bye, Coco.

26:22.125 --> 26:27.542
My mom had let me borrow her car so
that I could run some errands in town.

26:27.543 --> 26:30.183
[Dog whimpering]

26:31.380 --> 26:34.485
While I was in town, um...

26:34.486 --> 26:38.206
I came across a strange story.

26:38.266 --> 26:41.197
<i>Oh, it's quite possible there's
a family graveyard back there.</i>

26:41.198 --> 26:46.996
There really was a connection between that
cemetery and what was going on in my house.

26:46.997 --> 26:48.929
<i>Yeah, it was sad.</i>

26:48.930 --> 26:53.744
She said another house had stood either
where my house was or very close to it.

26:53.745 --> 26:58.064
And that there was
a fire in the house...

26:58.065 --> 27:01.113
And that a family had died...

27:01.114 --> 27:05.674
In that fire about
100 years before this.

27:14.830 --> 27:19.930
It feels like this is not
my imagination anymore.

27:20.195 --> 27:23.331
There was a real history here.

27:23.332 --> 27:27.652
Now it's really starting to feel real.

27:31.361 --> 27:32.863
Where's Coco?

27:32.864 --> 27:35.444
I'm not sure.

27:43.018 --> 27:45.720
How could have she gotten
out? The gate is closed.

27:45.721 --> 27:46.854
I don't know.

27:46.855 --> 27:48.756
- Coco!
- Coco!

27:48.757 --> 27:52.563
We checked the fence. We checked
everything we could think of.

27:52.564 --> 27:54.857
- Coco!
- Coco!

27:54.858 --> 27:57.832
There was no way for her
to get out of that yard.

27:57.833 --> 27:59.775
Come here, girl!

27:59.776 --> 28:02.839
We were calling for her,
yelling into the woods,

28:02.840 --> 28:06.874
hoping that she was somewhere close
by that she would just come back.

28:06.875 --> 28:08.602
Coco!

28:08.603 --> 28:11.417
She was just nowhere to be seen.

28:11.418 --> 28:13.614
- Coco!
- Coco!

28:13.615 --> 28:15.997
And my mom...

28:15.998 --> 28:20.558
Had this feeling that
she had been taken.

28:23.225 --> 28:25.418
I was really upset.

28:25.419 --> 28:29.619
She was part of the family, and I...

28:30.532 --> 28:33.490
Felt like a piece of
our family was missing.

28:33.491 --> 28:36.710
She wasn't there to make
us feel safe anymore.

28:36.711 --> 28:41.115
She wasn't there, watching over the
children while they slept at night.

28:41.116 --> 28:47.016
She wasn't there to warn me if
somebody was coming into the house.

29:04.278 --> 29:09.142
When Brian got home, I was
very glad to have him there.

29:09.143 --> 29:10.823
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:10.824 --> 29:12.080
It's looking pretty good.

29:12.081 --> 29:15.759
I didn't really talk to him about,

29:15.760 --> 29:19.233
the stuff that was going on
in the house while he was gone.

29:19.234 --> 29:21.502
I didn't want him to think
I was crazy, you know?

29:21.503 --> 29:25.337
Who wants to leave a crazy
woman alone with their children?

29:25.338 --> 29:30.210
It made me feel so much
better when he was home.

29:30.211 --> 29:32.813
I want to get some sleep, but
you can watch some TV if you want.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.415
Thank you.

29:34.416 --> 29:36.668
- Good night.
- Good night.

29:36.669 --> 29:40.492
I always go to bed before
everybody else because,

29:40.493 --> 29:46.117
I'm the one who gets up and
leaves at 2:30 in the morning.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.917
It was a Sunday evening.

29:47.918 --> 29:50.168
Nothing out of the ordinary.

29:50.169 --> 29:53.169
The house was quiet.

29:55.752 --> 30:01.153
I had gotten all the children to bed, and
I settled in pretty early that evening.

30:01.154 --> 30:05.174
It was probably about 8:30, 9:00.

30:30.252 --> 30:32.592
[Whispering]

30:37.175 --> 30:42.215
I started to have a dream
about the little boy.

30:48.526 --> 30:54.426
Only this time, I felt like the little
boy was trying to tell me something.

_.

32:00.596 --> 32:03.056
I heard a...

Bloodcurdling screech like I've
never heard before in my life.

32:07.747 --> 32:09.715
[Screaming]

32:09.716 --> 32:14.736
The sound that no mother ever
wants to hear from her child.

32:14.737 --> 32:15.737
Brian.

32:15.738 --> 32:19.395
I know she's freaking out. I know
something's happened to Shaun.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.258
Brian.

32:21.259 --> 32:22.338
Brian!

32:22.339 --> 32:25.135
I run down the hall.

32:25.136 --> 32:26.858
What's he doing in the
middle of the floor?

32:26.859 --> 32:27.788
I don't know.

32:27.789 --> 32:31.929
Laying in the middle of the floor...

32:32.456 --> 32:35.756
With his arm twisted up.

32:36.071 --> 32:40.840
I could just see immediately
that his arm was broken.

32:40.841 --> 32:43.121
[Screaming]

32:44.733 --> 32:48.693
He said that the bad man did it.

32:49.071 --> 32:53.260
Maybe he moved on to him
because he didn't have protection

32:53.261 --> 32:57.581
like the little girl was protecting me.

33:05.182 --> 33:07.282
Oh, my.

33:12.695 --> 33:18.215
I'm just thinking if that
happened to one of my kids.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.730
Sorry.

33:35.727 --> 33:38.847
That was a hard time.

33:52.434 --> 33:54.769
We gather everybody up.

33:54.770 --> 33:59.446
Belinda calls her mother, which
is on the way to the hospital.

33:59.447 --> 34:02.865
Brian drove as fast as he could.

34:02.866 --> 34:08.766
I'm just cradling Shaun in my arms, trying
to tell him that everything would be okay.

34:10.485 --> 34:12.186
Nurse!

34:12.187 --> 34:15.426
They're gonna want to
know how this happened.

34:15.427 --> 34:18.838
And the truth didn't seem...

34:18.839 --> 34:20.695
Like they would believe it.

34:20.696 --> 34:22.226
I think his arm's broken.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.518
- It's all right.
- Ow!

34:23.518 --> 34:26.527
The kind of break it
is raises suspicion.

34:26.527 --> 34:28.779
Because it's just not a normal break.

34:28.780 --> 34:29.851
Right here for you, buddy.

34:29.851 --> 34:32.940
I think they thought child
abuse at first, but, you know,

34:32.942 --> 34:37.453
they could obviously see that
we were just both devastated.

34:37.454 --> 34:40.246
There was... I mean, because...

34:40.248 --> 34:43.339
There's no way in hell...

34:43.340 --> 34:45.719
I could ever hurt the baby.

34:45.721 --> 34:48.301
[Siren wailing]

34:48.991 --> 34:52.728
After three days, Shaun was
released from the hospital.

34:52.730 --> 34:56.193
My mom had let me borrow
her car to bring him home,

34:56.194 --> 35:00.632
and I was dreading
going back to that house.

35:00.633 --> 35:03.127
It felt violent.

35:03.128 --> 35:05.368
It felt evil.

35:05.369 --> 35:08.446
Who could have done this to my child?

35:08.447 --> 35:11.879
What could have done this to my child?

35:11.880 --> 35:15.154
I kept going over it
and over it in my head.

35:15.155 --> 35:21.055
Thinking about all the times that
Shaun was afraid to go to bed.

35:21.249 --> 35:25.316
I should have listened
to what he was telling me.

35:25.317 --> 35:31.217
Because whatever he was seeing outside
of his window must have finally gotten in.

35:36.787 --> 35:41.231
We had to get out of that house,
and it didn't matter what it took.

35:41.232 --> 35:46.115
Whatever was there, whatever was
hurting my family, was getting stronger.

I didn't know what was wrong with it.

36:14.450 --> 36:16.379
All right, baby, we got to walk.

36:16.380 --> 36:22.280
I got Shaun out of the car, and
we started walking down the road.

36:22.870 --> 36:26.530
It was really dark out there.

36:34.683 --> 36:40.583
Suddenly I heard the sound of a
car approaching me from behind.

36:49.816 --> 36:53.959
The car slowed down as it passed by.

36:53.960 --> 36:56.415
Then it rolled the window down.

36:56.416 --> 36:58.680
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you okay?

36:58.681 --> 37:00.932
Yeah, our car broke down the road.

37:00.933 --> 37:02.368
Oh, gosh. Can I give you a ride?

37:02.369 --> 37:04.723
- Yes, please.
- Come on in. It's so cold.

37:04.724 --> 37:06.049
Honey, you got to go in the back.

37:06.050 --> 37:11.950
I was pretty relieved to see someone,
and she had such a friendly face.

37:13.591 --> 37:15.502
Thank you so much for picking us up.

37:15.503 --> 37:17.096
Oh, my pleasure.

37:17.097 --> 37:21.207
We started driving, and I
told her where I lived at.

37:21.208 --> 37:23.010
Yeah, just a few miles up.

37:23.011 --> 37:25.188
We're in a cabin off
the road in the woods.

37:25.189 --> 37:29.928
She said, oh, so you must have
heard the story about that house.

37:29.929 --> 37:32.630
You mean the one about the
fire and the children who died?

37:32.631 --> 37:34.065
She said, no, no.

37:34.066 --> 37:35.975
That wasn't what I meant.

37:35.976 --> 37:41.196
Surely you heard the rumors
of what happened there.

37:41.941 --> 37:44.520
I'm sorry. I probably
shouldn't say anything.

37:44.521 --> 37:47.341
No, please go on.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.961
She called it a rumor.

37:49.962 --> 37:55.862
Rumor has it that there was a man that
was accused of being a child molester.

37:58.056 --> 38:03.036
He went missing in the
woods behind your house.

38:08.608 --> 38:11.413
Some of the local men
lured him into the woods

38:11.414 --> 38:16.154
under a pretext of
going on a hunting trip.

38:30.295 --> 38:33.531
After they got far
enough into the woods...

38:33.532 --> 38:36.352
They ambushed him.

38:37.733 --> 38:40.493
And murdered him.

38:43.715 --> 38:45.875
[Gunshot]

38:46.740 --> 38:50.400
And his body was never found.

39:05.937 --> 39:08.577
[Flames roaring]

39:16.561 --> 39:21.057
I was so stunned by what
she had said that I don't

39:21.058 --> 39:26.158
remember the rest of the
ride back to the house.

39:27.672 --> 39:28.906
Thank you.

39:28.907 --> 39:30.408
You're welcome.

39:30.409 --> 39:33.109
Take care, okay?

39:38.117 --> 39:40.697
I knew then...

39:41.437 --> 39:44.197
That it was him.

39:45.299 --> 39:50.372
It was this man who had hurt
other children while he was alive.

39:50.373 --> 39:55.773
And he was now hurting my
children when he was dead.

40:18.759 --> 40:20.439
_.

40:23.452 --> 40:25.132
_.

40:38.348 --> 40:41.168
[Voices whispering]

40:54.298 --> 40:59.802
And we began to hear a noise, a scratching
noise on the outside of the house.

40:59.803 --> 41:01.771
Sounded like something
was trying to get in.

41:01.772 --> 41:04.772
[Scrabbling at walls]

41:08.446 --> 41:13.983
I knew that I had to get my
family away from this house.

41:13.984 --> 41:17.787
I needed to get them away fast...

41:17.788 --> 41:19.948
And far.

41:20.124 --> 41:22.526
I didn't want anyone else to get hurt.

41:22.527 --> 41:25.543
Hey, there. Give me your
hand. Let's go. Let's go.

41:25.544 --> 41:28.364
[Breathing heavily]

41:35.239 --> 41:37.399
[Shrieks]

41:38.076 --> 41:39.442
[Yelps]

41:39.443 --> 41:42.645
- Come on. Let's go. Blaire's in the car.
- Okay, let's go.

41:42.646 --> 41:45.411
- Okay, Sweetie?
- We literally up and left.

41:45.412 --> 41:47.484
She's had enough.

41:47.485 --> 41:49.040
We're moving.

41:49.041 --> 41:52.161
I was fine with that.

41:57.027 --> 41:59.907
I never went back.

42:09.707 --> 42:12.288
I think when we first moved in there,

42:12.289 --> 42:15.061
the innocent playful things
that were happening...

42:15.062 --> 42:18.144
Um, were the children.

42:18.145 --> 42:23.269
I feel that they were trying
to protect my family from...

42:23.270 --> 42:25.705
The man that hurt Shaun.

42:25.706 --> 42:30.026
Stay away from him. He's the bad man.

42:30.609 --> 42:33.815
The stronger the violence got...

42:33.816 --> 42:36.734
The more powerful he became.

42:36.735 --> 42:42.214
To the point where the children were
unable to protect us from him anymore.

42:42.215 --> 42:46.355
And, he was finally able to get in.

42:46.909 --> 42:50.372
Thinking back on everything...

42:50.373 --> 42:55.461
It just makes me wonder what really
happened before we moved into that house.
