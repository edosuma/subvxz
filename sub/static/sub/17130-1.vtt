WEBVTT

00:00.534 --> 00:01.335
CARMEN,

00:01.335 --> 00:05.773
ARE... YOU... PREGNANT?

00:09.843 --> 00:14.815
AAH!

00:14.815 --> 00:16.817
(baby crying)

00:16.817 --> 00:19.187
IT'S A GIRL, MR. LOPEZ.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.896
HI, CARMEN.

00:28.896 --> 00:31.765
(cooing)

00:31.765 --> 00:34.302
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.770
I'M YOUR DADDY,

00:36.770 --> 00:39.640
AND I PROMISE
I'LL ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF YOU,

00:39.640 --> 00:42.543
AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.078
GOOD.

00:44.078 --> 00:47.615
'CAUSE I'M GONNA PISS YOU OFF
BIG-TIME WHEN I'M 16.

00:47.615 --> 00:48.849
WHAT?

00:48.849 --> 00:50.151
IT'S PRETTY FUNNY, DAD.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.753
YOU LET MY BOYFRIEND
LIVE WITH US,

00:52.753 --> 00:55.089
THEN WHEN HE GOES TO PLAY
PRO BASEBALL BACK EAST,

00:55.089 --> 00:56.657
I'M GONNA
WANNA MARRY HIM.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.360
YOU CAN'T GET MARRIED
WHEN YOU'RE 16.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.695
I CAN IN GEORGIA,
IF I'M PREGNANT.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.764
(laughs wickedly)

01:11.305 --> 01:14.608
SIR, I DON'T WANT THIS ONE.
PUT IT BACK.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.479
RELAX. BREATHE.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.684
CARMEN,

01:23.684 --> 01:27.255
ARE... YOU... PREGNANT?

01:28.789 --> 01:29.990
IN THE HOUSE!

01:29.990 --> 01:32.560
SORRY, EVERYBODY.
PARTY'S OVER.

01:34.528 --> 01:38.031
HOW THE HELL COULD YOU
BE PREGNANT? YOU'RE 16.

01:38.031 --> 01:41.669
WOW! DÃ©JÃ  VU.

01:41.669 --> 01:44.672
I HAD THE SAME FIGHT
WITH MY DAD WHEN I WAS 16,

01:44.672 --> 01:47.575
EXCEPT HE WAS CHASING ME
THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD

01:47.575 --> 01:48.776
WITH A MACHETE.

01:48.776 --> 01:52.680
THAT WAS BACK
WHEN THEY LET YOU BE A PARENT.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.615
CARMEN, ANSWER ME.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.683
OKAY.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.719
I'M NOT REALLY PREGNANT.
I JUST SAID THAT

01:58.719 --> 02:00.821
TO SCARE YOU GUYS
INTO LETTING ME MARRY JASON.
(sighs)

02:00.821 --> 02:02.690
WELL, THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE GETTIN' MARRIED.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.559
FINE. THEN I'LL JUST GET
PREGNANT AND MOVE TO GEORGIA,

02:05.559 --> 02:08.496
(Southern accent)
'CAUSE I DON'T NEED

02:08.496 --> 02:10.998
Y'ALL'S CONSENT
TO GET MARRIED THERE.

02:10.998 --> 02:13.901
ANGIE, TELL ME YOU HAD
AN AFFAIR WITH GARTH BROOKS

02:13.901 --> 02:16.504
AND THAT SHE'S NOT MINE.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.872
CARMEN, YOU'RE TOO YOUNG
TO HAVE A BABY.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.008
GRANDMA HAD A KID
WHEN SHE WAS MY AGE.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.377
MOM,
TELL HER HOW HARD IT IS

02:23.377 --> 02:25.179
TO RAISE A KID
WHEN YOU'RE A TEENAGER.

02:25.179 --> 02:29.383
IT WAS LIKE A NIGHTMARE
THAT WOULDN'T END.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.588
THANK YOU.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.157
CARMEN, YOU HAVE
YOUR WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF YOU.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.327
IF YOU GET PREGNANT NOW,
TRUST ME,

02:39.327 --> 02:40.228
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET IT.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.962
SHE'S RIGHT.

02:41.962 --> 02:45.933
LOOK, THERE'S NOT A DAY GOES BY
I DON'T REGRET HAVING CHILDREN.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.035
YOU THINK YOUR MOM AND I
HAD THESE WORRY LINES

02:48.035 --> 02:50.471
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN?
GEORGE.

02:50.471 --> 02:54.208
WELL, DAMN IT, ANGIE,
WE WERE BEAUTIFUL.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.210
JASON'S MOVING
ALL THE WAY TO GEORGIA.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.279
IF I HAVE TO GET PREGNANT
TO BE WITH HIM,

02:58.279 --> 02:59.780
I'LL DO IT.

02:59.780 --> 03:00.581
CARMEN,

03:00.581 --> 03:02.650
I'M GONNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING

03:02.650 --> 03:04.852
YOUR MOTHER AND I
WERE KEEPING FROM YOU

03:04.852 --> 03:06.920
UNTIL YOU TURNED 18.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.957
THE DOCTOR TOLD US
THAT IF YOU GET PREGNANT,

03:09.957 --> 03:11.592
YOU'LL DIE.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.893
GEORGE!

03:15.095 --> 03:18.832
YOU GUYS CAN'T KEEP ME
FROM JASON ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN

03:18.832 --> 03:20.401
(Southern accent)
KEEP A HUNGRY BOLL WEEVIL

03:20.401 --> 03:22.803
FROM A FIELD FULL OF COTTON.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.772
WELL, IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED,

03:24.772 --> 03:26.940
(bad Southern accent)
YOU'RE CRAZIER THAN

03:26.940 --> 03:31.412
A GRAVY-COVERED CAT IN
A BARNYARD FULL OF BLOODHOUNDS.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.850
(normal voice)
IT'S HARD. YOU TRY IT.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.220
SORRY I'M LATE.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.124
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MR. LOPEZ.

03:44.124 --> 03:47.060
THANKS.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.097
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS GONNA BEAT YOU WITH

03:50.097 --> 03:52.199
UNTIL RIGHT NOW.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.001
OH, GOD.
SHE TOLD YOU.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.643
YOU WANT SOME CAKE,
HONEY?

04:02.643 --> 04:03.744
HANG ON.

04:03.744 --> 04:07.448
LET ME TAKE ONE MORE SWING
AT CARMEN.

04:07.448 --> 04:10.351
YOU NAME THE GOLF BALLS?

04:10.351 --> 04:11.985
YEAH.
SEE THE LETTERS?

04:11.985 --> 04:14.187
"C" IS FOR CARMEN,
"J" IS FOR JASON,

04:14.187 --> 04:16.824
AND "B" IS FOR BENNY.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.960
WHY DOES THIS ONE
HAVE AN "A" ON IT?

04:19.960 --> 04:23.697
UH,
"A" IS FOR ANYBODY.
MMM.

04:25.232 --> 04:27.968
SO YOU'VE BEEN
OUT HERE AWHILE.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.638
YOU'VE HAD TIME TO THINK.
WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT CARMEN?

04:30.638 --> 04:32.873
NOTHIN'. WE'RE SCREWED.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.208
THAT'S IT?
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT?

04:35.208 --> 04:37.010
NO.

04:37.010 --> 04:40.881
I DECIDED I WANTED TO BE CALLED
PAPI INSTEAD OF GRANDPA.

04:40.881 --> 04:45.118
NOW DO YOU WANNA BE CALLED
GRANNY OR NANA?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.887
I AM NOT A NANA.

04:46.887 --> 04:50.123
THIS IS NOT THE BUTT
OF A NANA.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.126
YOU KNOW, UM, THIS MIGHT BE
ONE OF THE TIMES WHEN

04:53.126 --> 04:56.897
WISDOM FROM AN OLDER GENERATION
WOULD BE HELPFUL.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.400
OKAY, LET'S--

04:59.400 --> 05:01.902
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO, DADDY?

05:01.902 --> 05:04.304
NOTHING. YOU'RE SCREWED,
GRANNY. (laughs)

05:05.205 --> 05:06.740
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS MEAN,

05:06.740 --> 05:09.242
BUT YOU PUT ME
THROUGH THE SAME THING.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.412
HEY, YOU MARRIED
WITHOUT MY APPROVAL,

05:11.412 --> 05:14.415
ALTHOUGH IN THIS CASE,
UNLIKE YOU,

05:14.415 --> 05:16.484
CARMEN WOULD BE RUNNING OFF

05:16.484 --> 05:20.688
WITH A SMART, WEALTHY MAN
WITH A FUTURE.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.257
DADDY, WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA GIVE THIS UP?

05:24.257 --> 05:25.258
GEORGE TURNED OUT GREAT.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.694
YEAH, WELL,

05:26.694 --> 05:29.597
EVEN A BLIND SQUIRREL
FINDS A NUT EVENTUALLY.

05:29.597 --> 05:32.600
STAND RIGHT THERE.
I'LL FIND TWO MORE.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.538
YOU KNOW,

05:37.538 --> 05:41.041
THE CRAZY THING IS
THAT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS,

05:41.041 --> 05:44.945
YOU WILL BE THRILLED FOR CARMEN
TO MARRY A BOY LIKE JASON.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.283
MY DAD'S RIGHT,

05:50.283 --> 05:53.554
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA
MAKE CARMEN WAIT TWO YEARS.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.623
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.926
WHY DON'T YOU
BLOW OUT YOUR CANDLE

05:58.926 --> 06:01.595
AND MAKE IT
YOUR BIRTHDAY WISH?

06:03.964 --> 06:05.433
ERNIE'S ON THE PHONE.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.468
YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE
IS ON FIRE.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.904
GEORGE.
I USED MY WISH ON CARMEN,
I SWEAR.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.045
(sirens wailing)

06:18.045 --> 06:19.747
OH, MY GOD.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.215
(gasps)
IT'S THE WHOLE HOUSE.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.452
ERNIE, DID YOU SEE MY MOM?
DID SHE GET OUT?

06:24.452 --> 06:26.954
NO. I GOT HERE AS SOON AS I
COULD, BUT NO ONE'S SEEN HER.

06:26.954 --> 06:30.123
YOU'LL HAVE
TO MOVE YOUR CAR, SIR.
THAT'S MY MOM'S HOUSE.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.460
HEY, I'M SORRY.
NO ONE CAN GO IN THERE.

06:34.495 --> 06:37.030
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT ALL THE SMOKE.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.599
MY MOM WILL GET OUT.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.000
SHE SMOKES FOUR PACKS A DAY.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.937
SHE'S BEEN TRAINING FOR THIS
HER WHOLE LIFE.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.576
MOM!

06:50.210 --> 06:53.146
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

06:56.183 --> 06:59.319
* ALL MY FRIENDS

06:59.319 --> 07:00.888
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

07:02.355 --> 07:05.526
* YEAH

07:13.634 --> 07:15.335
JASON'S ON THE COUCH,

07:15.335 --> 07:17.605
AND THE KIDS
ARE ASLEEP UPSTAIRS.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.807
I DIDN'T WANT
TO WAKE 'EM UP.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.712
HONEY, I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR MOM.

07:26.413 --> 07:30.784
THIS IS THE LAST CIGARETTE
SHE SMOKED AT OUR HOUSE.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.521
IT'S ALL I HAVE LEFT
TO REMEMBER HER BY.

07:33.521 --> 07:36.790
ACTUALLY,
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE

07:36.790 --> 07:40.561
FLOATING
IN THE DOWNSTAIRS TOILET.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.030
DON'T FLUSH IT, ANGIE,
NOT YET.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.532
I'M NOT READY.

07:44.532 --> 07:47.434
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S GONE.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.503
I MEAN,
SHE TAUGHT ME SO MUCH.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.138
BY THE TIME I WAS 5,

07:51.138 --> 07:53.340
I COULD LIGHT A SMOKE
ON THE STOVE

07:53.340 --> 07:55.142
AND MAKE A MARTINI DRY.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.645
SHE TAUGHT ME
HOW TO FIX A BOLOGNA SANDWICH

07:57.645 --> 07:59.647
AT THE GROCERY STORE,
ANGIE,

07:59.647 --> 08:01.915
AND EAT IT
BEFORE ANYBODY FOUND OUT.

08:03.784 --> 08:07.855
YEP, THERE'LL NEVER BE
ANOTHER LIKE HER.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.624
I NEVER GOT A CHANCE
TO TELL YOU, MOM,

08:10.624 --> 08:13.426
BUT I LOVE YOU.

08:13.426 --> 08:16.630
GOD, ANGIE, DID HE JUST
COME OUT OF THE CLOSET?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.566
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

08:18.566 --> 08:20.568
MOM,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!

08:20.568 --> 08:23.203
WHAT ARE YOU DO--
GET OFF ME!

08:23.203 --> 08:25.539
AY, GUEY.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.643
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

08:29.643 --> 08:31.679
I WAS AT THIRSTY'S
GETTING A DRINK.

08:31.679 --> 08:35.048
I MET A TRUCKER.
I GOT IN HIS CAB.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.653
OH, SO THAT'S WHY
YOU THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.

08:39.653 --> 08:43.190
SOMEONE CALLED 'CAUSE
THEY HEARD THE SCREAMS.

08:48.696 --> 08:51.398
WELL, HE WASN'T VERY FLEXIBLE
TO START WITH,

08:51.398 --> 08:53.533
BUT HE IS NOW.

09:01.575 --> 09:05.478
BENNY,
YOUR HOUSE CAUGHT ON FIRE.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.047
WHAT?

09:07.047 --> 09:09.082
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD, MOM.
YOUR HOUSE BURNED DOWN.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.217
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.719
WE'RE NOT KIDDING.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.286
THE FIREMAN SAID
IT STARTED IN THE BEDROOM.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.522
I MEAN, DID YOU LEAVE
A CIGARETTE BURNING?

09:15.522 --> 09:16.857
NO,
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.026
I PUT THE CIGARETTE OUT
IN THE ASHTRAY.

09:19.026 --> 09:22.830
I DUMPED THE ASHTRAY
INTO THE TRASH CAN.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.565
THE TRASH CAN
BY THE DRAPES?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.567
DAMN IT.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.871
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, BENNY.

09:30.871 --> 09:34.041
HOPE YOU ENJOY
THESE FLAMMABLE DRAPES.

09:35.042 --> 09:38.211
WAIT,
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.213
DADDY, LOOK,
YOU CAN'T IGNORE THIS.

09:40.213 --> 09:43.216
IF YOU WON'T LET ME MARRY JASON,
I'M HAVING HIS BABY.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.619
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY?

09:45.619 --> 09:47.755
WHEN WE TALKED
ABOUT HAVING KIDS,

09:47.755 --> 09:50.891
YOU SAID A BOY FOR ME
AND A GIRL FOR YOU.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.726
WELL,
MINE'S UPSTAIRS SLEEPING.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.194
GOOD LUCK WITH YOURS.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.805
JASON.
JASON, WAKE UP.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.306
WAKE UP, JASON.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.942
I DIDN'T TOUCH YOUR DAUGHTER,
MR. LOPEZ.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.779
IT'S JUST ME.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.213
ARE YOU KIDDING?

10:13.213 --> 10:15.582
YOUR DAD ALREADY WANTS
TO KILL ME. GET OUT OF HERE.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.685
SHH. DO YOU
REALLY WANT TO MARRY ME?

10:17.685 --> 10:19.252
YEAH.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.754
WELL,
OUR BLUFF DIDN'T WORK.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.489
YOU HAVE TO GET ME PREGNANT
FOR REAL.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.591
WHOA.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.661
C-CARMEN, A-A BABY?

10:27.661 --> 10:28.962
IT'S SO FAST.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.832
I MEAN,
IF YOU BREASTFEED,

10:31.832 --> 10:35.903
I'LL BE FIGHTING
MY OWN BABY FOR SECOND BASE.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.844
JASON...

10:43.844 --> 10:46.680
I LOVE YOU ENOUGH
TO HAVE YOUR BABY.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.949
DON'T YOU LOVE ME ENOUGH?

10:50.684 --> 10:53.721
UH...

10:53.721 --> 10:55.155
SURE.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.357
(squeals)

10:57.357 --> 10:58.558
GOOD.

10:58.558 --> 10:59.860
WE'LL TRY TOMORROW NIGHT.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.862
I WANT OUR FIRST TIME
TO BE PERFECT,

11:01.862 --> 11:04.364
SO I'LL RENT A REALLY
ROMANTIC HOTEL ROOM,

11:04.364 --> 11:05.699
BUY A SEXY OUTFIT,

11:05.699 --> 11:07.500
OH, AND I'LL BRING
MR. SNUGGLE BEAR.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.939
I'LL DEFINITELY GET PREGNANT
'CAUSE HE'S MY LUCKY CHARM.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.944
YOU'RE BRINGING
A STUFFED ANIMAL?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.014
OH,

11:21.014 --> 11:24.284
DOES IT BOTHER YOU
'CAUSE HE'S A BOY BEAR?

11:26.653 --> 11:28.989
YEAH,
THAT'S WHY IT BOTHERS ME.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.401
OH,
WHAT TIME IS IT?

11:41.401 --> 11:42.502
7:30.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.603
OH.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.072
YOU WANT SOME COFFEE,
BENNY?

11:45.072 --> 11:47.941
NO. MY HOUSE SHOULD BE
COOL BY NOW.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.943
YOU KNOW,
I GOTTA GET OVER THERE

11:49.943 --> 11:52.279
BEFORE MY NEIGHBORS
START STEALING ALL MY STUFF.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.814
WANT ME
TO GO WITH YOU?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.983
NO.
I MOVE FASTER BY MYSELF.

11:55.983 --> 11:59.619
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
DURING THE RIOTS.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.421
THEY WEREN'T RIOTS.

12:01.421 --> 12:05.959
WE WERE FIGHTING
FOR ROBBIE KING'S RIGHTS.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.330
MOM, RODNEY KING.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.935
THE BLACK GUY?

12:21.541 --> 12:23.143
MORNIN'.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.180
CARMEN, YOUR MOM AND I
TALKED LAST NIGHT,

12:27.180 --> 12:29.316
AND WE MADE A DECISION.

12:29.316 --> 12:33.353
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GET PREGNANT.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.322
YOU CAN MARRY JASON.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.857
WHAT?

12:36.857 --> 12:38.691
LOOK, WE REALIZED
JASON'S A GREAT GUY,

12:38.691 --> 12:40.493
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.595
WE'LL THROW YOU
THE WEDDING OF YOUR DREAMS.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.664
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS FINISH HIGH SCHOOL.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.333
SERIOUS?

12:46.333 --> 12:48.802
LOOK, WE REALIZED IT'S BETTER
THAN BEING PREGNANT AT 16.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.804
THIS WAY
YOU CAN HAVE A LIFE FIRST

12:50.804 --> 12:52.806
SO WHEN YOU FINALLY
DO HAVE KIDS,

12:52.806 --> 12:55.475
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHY
YOU RESENT THEM...

12:55.475 --> 12:59.379
WHY EVERY MOVE THEY MAKE,
YOU LOOK AT 'EM LIKE, "BOY..."

13:03.250 --> 13:05.853
SO HOW SOON AFTER I GRADUATE
CAN I GET MARRIED?

13:05.853 --> 13:06.987
THE DAY AFTER,

13:06.987 --> 13:08.488
'CAUSE THE DAY AFTER THAT,

13:08.488 --> 13:11.524
I'M HAVING A BIG-SCREEN TV
INSTALLED IN YOUR ROOM.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.026
WHAT?

13:13.026 --> 13:15.028
I THOUGHT WE WERE
SAVING THAT FOR A NURSERY

13:15.028 --> 13:16.696
IN CASE WE WANTED
TO HAVE ANOTHER BABY.

13:16.696 --> 13:20.267
YOU WANT TO GO
THROUGH THIS AGAIN?

13:21.869 --> 13:24.204
NO.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.706
SO IT'S REALLY HAPPENING.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.876
I'M GONNA BE A JUNE BRIDE!

13:28.876 --> 13:30.844
JASON'S GONNA BE SO EXCITED.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.881
JASON,
WE HAVE A WEDDING DATE!

13:33.881 --> 13:35.182
JASON'S NOT HERE.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.517
HE LEFT THIS MORNING
WITH HIS SUITCASE.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.288
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING?

13:41.288 --> 13:46.426
BECAUSE HE SAID
HE'D SEE ME SUNDAY.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.760
WAIT,

13:47.760 --> 13:51.198
MAYBE HE SAID
HE'D SEE ME SOMEDAY.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.207
WHERE'S JASON?

14:00.207 --> 14:01.909
ALL HIS STUFF IS GONE,
EVEN HIS SUITCASE.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.343
DID YOU TWO
HAVE A FIGHT OR SOMETHING?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.345
NO.
LAST NIGHT WE HAD A TALK,

14:05.345 --> 14:07.347
AND I TOLD HIM
WE HAD TO HAVE A BABY.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.649
HE WAS SO EXCITED
ABOUT BEING A DAD,

14:09.649 --> 14:11.284
HE WAS SHAKING.

14:13.086 --> 14:17.290
THE KIND OF SHAKING SPRINTERS DO
RIGHT BEFORE THEY RUN?

14:19.226 --> 14:21.461
HOW COULD JASON JUST LEAVE
WITHOUT TELLING ME?

14:24.364 --> 14:26.566
UNLESS HE WANTED
TO SURPRISE ME

14:26.566 --> 14:30.237
BY BUYING OUR DREAM HOUSE
IN GEORGIA!

14:30.237 --> 14:34.774
OR MAYBE HE WENT
TO HIS OTHER GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE.

14:34.774 --> 14:38.345
YOU KNOW,
THE ONE WITH THE BRAIN.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.315
LOOK, CARMEN,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL

14:42.315 --> 14:45.452
JASON ON HIS CELL PHONE
AND ASK HIM WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

14:46.586 --> 14:48.788
WHEN SHE REALIZES
WHAT JUST HAPPENED,

14:48.788 --> 14:50.823
SHE IS GONNA BE DEVASTATED.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.626
I'LL GET MY CLICHÃ©S READY.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.262
YOU WERE TOO GOOD FOR HIM.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.730
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER FISH
IN THE OCEAN.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.232
THIS ONE'S MY FAVORITE,

14:59.232 --> 15:01.301
BUT YOU GOTTA SIT DOWN
FOR THIS ONE--

15:01.301 --> 15:03.303
EVERYTHING HAPPENS
FOR A REASON.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.305
YOU GOTTA SELL THAT
IN THE EYES.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.940
WATCH THAT COMPASSION.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.580
"EVERYTHING HAPPENS
FOR A REASON"?

15:13.580 --> 15:16.916
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
WHEN MY HAMSTER DIED.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.818
WHAT DID YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

15:18.818 --> 15:20.320
THAT MR. FLUFFER STARVED

15:20.320 --> 15:22.655
BECAUSE A SELFISH LITTLE BOY
GOT A SKATEBOARD

15:22.655 --> 15:24.091
AND FORGOT TO FEED HIM?

15:25.993 --> 15:27.827
YEAH, YOU WISH
YOU HAD A CLICHÃ© NOW,

15:27.827 --> 15:30.663
DON'T YOU, HAMSTER KILLER?

15:30.663 --> 15:33.133
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM
TRYIN' TO GET WATER, MAX.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.135
HE WENT LIKE THAT.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.637
I GOT AHOLD OF JASON.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.007
TURNS OUT HE'S NOT
BUYING THE HOUSE.

15:40.007 --> 15:42.775
WHAT?!

15:42.775 --> 15:44.777
HE SAYS HE THINKS
WE'RE MOVING TOO FAST,

15:44.777 --> 15:46.779
AND HE'S NOT SURE
HE'S READY TO HAVE A BABY,

15:46.779 --> 15:49.983
BUT HE DID HAVE A GREAT PLAN ON
HOW TO KEEP OUR LOVE STRONGER.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.352
HE THINKS WE SHOULD
SEE OTHER PEOPLE.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.489
WELL, EVERYTHING HAPPENS
FOR A REASON.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.329
WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO HIM?

16:02.329 --> 16:05.032
OH, I SAID,
"BABY, DATE WHOEVER YOU WANT,

16:05.032 --> 16:07.600
"BUT JUST GET IT
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM BY JUNE 17th,

16:07.600 --> 16:09.736
"BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED."

16:13.340 --> 16:15.342
BUT THEN HE MUST HAVE
GONE INTO A TUNNEL

16:15.342 --> 16:18.311
BECAUSE THE LINE
JUST CUT OFF,

16:18.311 --> 16:20.313
SO I'M GONNA
WAIT A COUPLE MINUTES

16:20.313 --> 16:21.981
AND THEN CALL HIM BACK.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.783
WELL, YEAH,
TAKE YOUR TIME, SWEETHEART.

16:23.783 --> 16:26.219
YOU KNOW, THAT TUNNEL
LEAVIN' L.A. IS PRETTY LONG.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.290
MOM, I'M GONNA
GO CALL MY BRIDESMAIDS.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.624
OKAY.

16:31.624 --> 16:35.828
WHY DOESN'T SOMEBODY
JUST TELL HER JASON BAILED?

16:35.828 --> 16:38.898
BECAUSE SHE'S IN DENIAL.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.700
IT WILL BE EASIER FOR HER

16:40.700 --> 16:43.170
TO SLOWLY FIGURE THIS OUT
ON HER OWN.

16:43.170 --> 16:46.039
IT'S HARD
WHEN YOUR FIRST LOVE ENDS.

16:46.039 --> 16:50.410
I KNOW I MUST HAVE BROKEN
THE HEARTS OF A DOZEN BOYS.

16:53.246 --> 16:57.450
YEAH, I BROKE
A LOT OF HEARTS MYSELF.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.887
YOU'LL BE
LIKE YOUR OLD MAN, MAX.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.389
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:02.389 --> 17:04.591
I'M THE ONLY GIRL
YOU EVER DATED.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.495
NOT IN FRONT OF THE BOY!
HE LOOKS UP TO ME.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.100
DEMASCULATE ME,
WHY DON'T YOU?

17:28.181 --> 17:31.784
HEY, CHECK IT OUT.
IT'S THE GHETTO MARY POPPINS.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.456
OH, COME ON, MOM,

17:36.456 --> 17:40.660
I'M JUST TRYING TO CHEER YOU UP,
YOU DIRTY LITTLE OOMPA LOOMPA.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.134
BENNY, ARE YOU OKAY?

17:47.134 --> 17:49.302
PEACHY.

17:49.302 --> 17:52.539
SO DID ANYTHING
SURVIVE THE FIRE?

17:52.539 --> 17:56.276
JUST THIS STUPID ASHTRAY.
LOOK AT THAT.

17:57.677 --> 18:01.013
THIS IS THE HANDPRINT
I MADE YOU IN FIRST GRADE.

18:01.013 --> 18:04.984
IT MEANT MORE TO ME WHEN I
THOUGHT IT WAS AN ASHTRAY.

18:04.984 --> 18:09.122
DO YOU WANT TO USE OUR PHONE
TO CALL THE INSURANCE COMPANY?

18:09.122 --> 18:11.624
INSURANCE IS FOR SUCKERS.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.228
MOM, YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY INSURANCE?

18:15.228 --> 18:17.029
GEORGE, I GOT TIRED
OF THROWING AWAY

18:17.029 --> 18:21.401
100 BUCKS A MONTH FOR NOTHING,
SO I DECIDED TO SAVE IT.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.871
THEN YOU MUST HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD STASH IN THE BANK.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.340
BANKS ARE FOR SUCKERS.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.342
THEY CHARGE YOU
ALL THOSE FEES.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.344
YOU KNOW,
YOU MIGHT AS WELL

18:31.344 --> 18:34.514
KEEP YOUR MONEY
IN YOUR MATTRESS.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.717
MOM, PLEASE SAY THAT
MATTRESSES ARE FOR SUCKERS.

18:37.717 --> 18:42.255
YEP, THEY SURE ARE.

18:42.255 --> 18:45.258
HOW MUCH MONEY
DID YOU LOSE?

18:45.258 --> 18:47.694
ALL OF IT...

18:47.694 --> 18:49.529
$53,000.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.231
(gasps)

18:51.231 --> 18:55.235
HOW DID YOU GET
THAT MUCH MONEY IN A MATTRESS?

18:55.235 --> 18:59.272
YOU NEED AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE
TO SMASH IT DOWN.

18:59.272 --> 19:02.409
UGH...

19:04.444 --> 19:07.780
GEORGE, I LOST EVERYTHING.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.982
AFTER A LIFETIME
OF BUSTING MY ASS,

19:09.982 --> 19:12.785
I END UP WITH NOTHING.

19:12.785 --> 19:16.389
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY,
NO PLACE TO LIVE.

19:26.132 --> 19:29.569
GEORGE.
YEAH, TAKE IT EASY.
I'LL BE HERE WHEN YOU GET BACK.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.212
YOUR MOM HAS NOWHERE TO LIVE.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.214
WE CAN EITHER TAKE HER IN,

19:41.214 --> 19:43.750
OR SHE'LL BE HOMELESS,
LIVING ON THE STREETS.

19:49.722 --> 19:50.923
WHICH STREET?

19:50.923 --> 19:53.326
GEORGE!

19:53.326 --> 19:55.628
SO DO TO HER
WHAT SHE DID TO MY DOG--

19:55.628 --> 19:57.630
TAKE HER
TO A STRANGE NEIGHBORHOOD,

19:57.630 --> 19:59.832
AND WHEN SHE GETS OUT
TO RELIEVE HERSELF,

19:59.832 --> 20:01.334
WE TAKE OFF.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.336
THE LAST THING WE SEE
IS HER CONFUSED FACE

20:03.336 --> 20:05.171
LIT UP BY THE TAIL LIGHTS.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.307
SHE BE LIKE THAT.

20:07.307 --> 20:10.510
I'M NOT SAYING
THAT I WANT HER HERE,

20:10.510 --> 20:12.812
BUT IT'S
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.814
LOOK, THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.116
WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT BRINGING
THE HELL FROM MY CHILDHOOD

20:17.116 --> 20:18.518
INTO OUR HOUSE.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.454
SHE'S ALREADY OVER HERE
EVERY NIGHT FOR DINNER.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.757
LOOK, THIS IS DIFFERENT.
THIS IS 24/7.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.960
WE'RE FAMILY.
THIS IS WHAT FAMILY DOES.

20:37.003 --> 20:40.206
SO, MOM...

20:40.206 --> 20:43.543
YOU WANNA STAY WITH US?

20:46.346 --> 20:48.080
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?

20:48.080 --> 20:51.484
MAN, IT JUST KEEPS
GETTING WORSE FOR ME.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.919
HEY, YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.355
BENNY, YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE YOU SOME BREAKFAST?

20:55.355 --> 20:56.323
YOU MUST BE HUNGRY.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.324
NO.

20:57.324 --> 21:00.327
THANK YOU, PRINCESS.

21:00.327 --> 21:03.996
I'VE SEEN
ENOUGH BURNT THINGS TODAY.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.138
WE SAY
IT'S A FAMILY VACATION.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.573
WE GO TO ALASKA.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.576
WE PUT HER IN A TUXEDO
SO SHE LOOKS LIKE A PENGUIN

21:16.576 --> 21:18.711
AND PUSH HER OUT TO SEA.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.482
YOU'VE SEEN HER WALK,
ANGIE.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.016
THE POLAR BEARS WON'T
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.
