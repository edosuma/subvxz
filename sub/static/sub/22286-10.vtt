07:33.166 --> 07:34.250
-WHAT ARE YOU, HUNG OVER?

07:34.291 --> 07:35.250
TAKE A LAP.

07:35.291 --> 07:36.291
A LAP, NOW!

07:36.333 --> 07:37.291
GO!

07:37.333 --> 07:38.291
GO!

07:38.333 --> 07:39.291
SECOND TEAM!

07:39.333 --> 07:40.959
ARE YOU CATCHING THIS?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.458
SLOPPY FEET.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.667
KEEP RUNNING!

07:46.250 --> 07:48.959
-THE TRUTH IS, THESE KIDS

07:46.250 --> 07:48.959
NEED DISCIPLINE.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.917
YOU KNOW, I REALLY

07:49.000 --> 07:50.917
BELIEVE THEY--

07:50.959 --> 07:52.959
THEY WANT TO BE PUSHED

07:50.959 --> 07:52.959
TO THEIR LIMIT.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.291
AND THEN GOOD STUFF HAPPENS--

07:54.333 --> 07:55.291
-HARMON!

07:55.333 --> 07:57.625
HARMON!

07:57.667 --> 07:58.458
-WHAT THE HELL?

07:58.500 --> 07:59.417
-OK, MAKE WAY!

07:59.458 --> 08:00.667
CLEAR OUT!

08:00.709 --> 08:01.792
THIS IS HEAT EXHAUSTION.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.500
I'M GOING TO COOL

08:01.834 --> 08:03.500
DOWN HIS CORE.

08:03.542 --> 08:06.125
TAKE HIS PANTS OFF.

08:06.166 --> 08:09.709
-HEY, YOU REALLY DON'T NEED

08:06.166 --> 08:09.709
TO FILM THIS, ALL RIGHT?

08:09.750 --> 08:10.625
-WHERE YOU GOING TO

08:09.750 --> 08:10.625
PUT THAT ROD?

08:10.667 --> 08:12.125
-HOLD HIS LEG UP.

08:12.166 --> 08:13.083
STAND BACK.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.542
-WHAT ARE YOU--

08:14.583 --> 08:16.000
-OH!

08:16.041 --> 08:17.458
[GROANS]

08:17.500 --> 08:18.417
-OH, GOD!

08:18.458 --> 08:20.166
-HEY, I SAID DON'T FILM THIS!

08:20.208 --> 08:21.166
GET AWAY.

08:21.208 --> 08:22.417
MOVE OUT OF THE WAY.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.750
-YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT, SON.

08:23.792 --> 08:25.000
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.750
NARRATOR: AFTER A ROCKY START

08:28.542 --> 08:31.750
TO THE WEEK, THE MOUNTAIN

08:31.792 --> 08:34.834
GOATS PREPARE FOR THEIR UPCOMING

08:31.792 --> 08:34.834
GAME AGAINST EMERTON

08:34.875 --> 08:37.417
U.

08:37.458 --> 08:39.667
-IT'S A LITTLE SURPRISE, BUT

08:37.458 --> 08:39.667
THE WHOLE ICICLE UP THE ASS

08:39.709 --> 08:44.375
TRICK, YOU KNOW, IT'S A LITTLE--

08:39.709 --> 08:44.375
LITTLE ARCHAIC.

08:44.417 --> 08:46.458
I'M MORE OF A SMELLING SALTS

08:44.417 --> 08:46.458
KIND OF GUY, YOU KNOW?

08:46.500 --> 08:51.709
-SO THEN THE ICICLE WENT UP MY

08:46.500 --> 08:51.709
ASS, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M

08:51.750 --> 08:54.667
FLOATING IN AN ETHEREAL LIGHT.

08:54.709 --> 08:57.583
THAT'S WHEN I HEARD MY COUSIN

08:54.709 --> 08:57.583
DENNIS' VOICE TELLING ME IT

08:57.625 --> 08:58.959
WASN'T MY TIME.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.917
-IS YOUR COUSIN DEAD?

09:00.959 --> 09:01.750
-NOPE.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.000
THAT'S THE WEIRD THING.

09:03.041 --> 09:05.083
ALSO, HE LOST HIS VOICE

09:03.041 --> 09:05.083
IN A PENCIL FACTORY

09:05.125 --> 09:06.125
ACCIDENT LAST YEAR.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.875
SO, DOUBLE WEIRD.

09:07.917 --> 09:08.875
-WOW.

09:08.917 --> 09:10.208
THAT SOUNDS AMAZING.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.417
-IT WAS.

09:11.458 --> 09:14.041
BETTER THAN ANY DRUG

09:11.458 --> 09:14.041
I'VE EVER HAD.

09:14.083 --> 09:16.125
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

09:16.166 --> 09:17.125
-OK.

09:17.166 --> 09:18.125
-MORAN.

09:18.166 --> 09:18.959
-YEAH?

09:21.834 --> 09:24.750
-I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY PUTTING

09:21.834 --> 09:24.750
YOURSELF OUT THERE EVERY DAY,

09:24.792 --> 09:28.750
THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT BLINDING

09:24.792 --> 09:28.750
YOUR EYEBALLS.

09:28.792 --> 09:31.792
I'VE SEEN IT DESTROY TOUGHER

09:28.792 --> 09:31.792
MEN THAN BOTH OF US.

09:31.834 --> 09:35.667
BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU

09:31.834 --> 09:35.667
THERE'S HOPE, BROTHER.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.917
WE HAVE TO--

09:38.959 --> 09:40.750
WE HAVE TO, UH--

09:40.792 --> 09:42.041
LINE!

09:42.083 --> 09:44.166
-"LEAD THESE MEN WITH HUMILITY

09:44.208 --> 09:46.458
AND COURAGE." -SHIT!

09:46.500 --> 09:47.709
LET ME TRY THAT AGAIN.

09:52.375 --> 09:53.333
MORAN.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.125
-YEAH.

09:55.166 --> 09:58.041
-I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY PUTTING

09:55.166 --> 09:58.041
YOURSELF OUT THERE EVERY DAY,

09:58.083 --> 10:01.000
THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT BLINDING

09:58.083 --> 10:01.000
YOUR EYEBALLS.

10:01.041 --> 10:02.750
I'VE SEEN IT DESTROY--

10:05.458 --> 10:08.709
NARRATOR: LIKE GENERALS

10:05.458 --> 10:08.709
PREPARING FOR WAR, THE BMS

10:08.750 --> 10:11.208
COACHES KNOW THAT STRATEGY

10:08.750 --> 10:11.208
AND PREPARATION

10:11.250 --> 10:14.041
ARE THE KEYS TO VICTORY.

10:14.083 --> 10:14.917
MARTY DANIELS (OFFSCREEN):

10:14.083 --> 10:14.917
YOU KNOW, I

10:14.959 --> 10:16.625
LOVE STRATEGY MEETINGS.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.458
IT'S A TIME TO LEARN ABOUT YOUR

10:16.667 --> 10:19.458
OPPONENT, TO FIND OUT

10:19.500 --> 10:21.125
WAYS TO TAKE AWAY ANY ADVANTAGES

10:19.500 --> 10:21.125
THEY HAVE.

10:21.166 --> 10:24.291
-WE KNOW EMERTON IS GOING TO

10:21.166 --> 10:24.291
ATTACK US FROM THE INSIDE ON

10:24.333 --> 10:26.834
BOTH OFFENSE AND DEFENSE.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.333
WE ALSO KNOW THIS GAME IS

10:26.875 --> 10:29.333
GOING TO BE WON IN THE

10:29.375 --> 10:30.834
TRENCHES.

10:30.875 --> 10:31.792
-I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING

10:30.875 --> 10:31.792
DIFFERENT ABOUT MARTY'S LOOK.

10:31.834 --> 10:33.208
HE ALWAYS DRESSES THAT WAY.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.667
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, HE'S

10:33.250 --> 10:35.667
A VERY HIP GUY.

10:35.709 --> 10:37.000
-NOW WATCH THIS, RIGHT HERE.

10:37.041 --> 10:38.458
RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THERE!

10:38.500 --> 10:40.709
LET ME RUN IT BACK.

10:40.750 --> 10:42.583
IT'S NOT WORKING.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.000
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:46.917 --> 10:48.709
I'LL GET IT FOR YA.

10:48.750 --> 10:49.959
MARTY DANIELS (OFFSCREEN): OF

10:48.750 --> 10:49.959
COURSE I DEAL WITH PRESSURE,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.500
BECAUSE IT COMES WITH THE JOB.

10:52.542 --> 10:55.500
BUT IT DOESN'T COME FROM

10:52.542 --> 10:55.500
ANY OF MY GILL DAYS.

10:55.542 --> 10:57.333
-HONEY, YOU SAID GILL DAYS.

10:57.375 --> 10:58.667
-DID I?

10:58.709 --> 11:00.500
OH, I MEANT COACHES.

11:00.542 --> 11:04.125
THE POINT IS I DON'T FEEL ANY

11:00.542 --> 11:04.125
PRESSURE, EXCEPT THE PRESSURE

11:04.166 --> 11:06.500
I PUT ON MYSELF TO

11:04.166 --> 11:06.500
BE A WINNER.

11:10.291 --> 11:12.792
-ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

11:10.291 --> 11:12.792
NOTICED WHEN I ARRIVED AT BMS

11:12.834 --> 11:15.667
WAS A LACK OF TECHNOLOGY IN

11:12.834 --> 11:15.667
THE COACHING DEPARTMENT.

11:15.709 --> 11:19.333
-AS YOU CAN SEE, EMERTON'S

11:15.709 --> 11:19.333
DEFENSE, 18% MORE SUCCESSFUL

11:19.375 --> 11:21.000
STOPPING RUNS TO THE LEFT.

11:21.041 --> 11:22.291
-NO SHIT.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.375
THEIR BEST DEFENSIVE PLAYER

11:22.333 --> 11:24.375
IS THEIR LEFT END.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.000
-YOU DON'T NEED STARTS

11:24.417 --> 11:27.000
TO KNOW THAT.

11:27.041 --> 11:28.166
-SABERMETRICS, COACH.

11:28.208 --> 11:29.750
WELCOME TO THE 21ST CENTURY.

11:29.792 --> 11:35.083
SO AS I WAS SAYING, EMERTON IS

11:29.792 --> 11:35.083
MOST VULNERABLE RIGHT HERE.

11:35.125 --> 11:38.542
[CHEERS]

11:38.583 --> 11:40.041
-WHAT THE HELL!

11:40.083 --> 11:41.542
WHAT THE-- WHO DID THIS?

11:41.583 --> 11:43.041
THAT'S MY WIFE , YOU MORONS!

11:43.083 --> 11:44.542
WHO THE HELL DID THIS?

11:44.583 --> 11:46.041
WHO IN THE HELL DID THIS!

11:46.083 --> 11:47.041
THIS IS NOT FUNNY!

11:47.083 --> 11:47.875
HUH?

11:47.917 --> 11:48.709
HUH?

11:48.750 --> 11:49.709
COME ON.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.000
HEY, DID YOU DO THIS, MORAN?

11:52.041 --> 11:53.208
OK.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.542
EVERYBODY UP!

11:54.583 --> 11:55.542
OUTSIDE!

11:55.583 --> 11:56.375
[LAUGHTER]

11:56.417 --> 11:57.417
-RIGHT NOW!

11:57.458 --> 12:04.458
-(LAUGHING)

12:05.792 --> 12:07.208
MISS TITS.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.917
-NOT SO FUNNY NOW,

12:07.250 --> 12:09.917
IS IT, BOYS?

12:09.959 --> 12:11.125
-LOOK, I UNDERSTAND.

12:11.166 --> 12:13.041
PRANKS CAN BUILD CAMARADERIE

12:11.166 --> 12:13.041
IN A TEAM.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.166
I GET THAT, ALL RIGHT?

12:14.208 --> 12:15.959
BUT THERE IS A LINE THAT

12:14.208 --> 12:15.959
IS CROSSED WHEN

12:16.000 --> 12:17.458
IT COMES TO MY WIFE.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.709
-FUNNY LITTLE JOKE YOU HAD

12:17.500 --> 12:20.709
TO PLAY ON MY WIFE!

12:20.750 --> 12:24.208
-NEBRASKA CAN BE A VERY STRANGE

12:20.750 --> 12:24.208
AND OVERWHELMING PLACE

12:24.250 --> 12:26.583
FOR A YOUNG WOMAN TO GROW UP.

12:26.625 --> 12:28.417
RIGHT?

12:28.458 --> 12:29.417
HONEY?

12:29.458 --> 12:30.959
HUH?

12:31.000 --> 12:34.208
-I MEAN, I'M NOT SAYING IT WAS

12:31.000 --> 12:34.208
ME, BUT MY BEST FRIEND HERE

12:34.250 --> 12:37.583
DOES HAPPEN TO BE A FAN OF

12:34.250 --> 12:37.583
REGIONAL BREAST COMPETITIONS.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.458
-AND I HAPPEN TO HAVE A

12:37.625 --> 12:39.458
PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY WHEN IT

12:39.500 --> 12:40.500
COMES TO BOOBS.

12:40.542 --> 12:41.750
-SO--

12:44.041 --> 12:44.834
-UH, MISS.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.792
HEFTY GUMDROPS, 2003.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.125
AND I'M RIGHT AGAIN.

12:49.166 --> 12:50.458
SO--

12:53.375 --> 12:55.083
-COME ON IN.

12:55.125 --> 12:57.834
NARRATOR: AFTER SEVERAL TENSE

12:55.125 --> 12:57.834
DAYS OF PRACTICE, THE TEAM

12:57.875 --> 13:03.667
DECIDES TO LET OFF SOME STEAM

12:57.875 --> 13:03.667
AT THE GOAT HOUSE.

13:03.709 --> 13:08.125
-THIS IS A PRETTY TYPICAL NIGHT

13:03.709 --> 13:08.125
HERE AT BMS. YOU KNOW?

13:08.166 --> 13:09.375
HI, AGAIN.

13:09.417 --> 13:13.000
YOU KNOW, WE WORK HARD,

13:09.417 --> 13:13.000
BUT WE PLAY HARD, TOO.

13:13.041 --> 13:20.041
[CHANTING]

13:28.750 --> 13:30.625
HEAT EXHAUSTION!

13:30.667 --> 13:34.500

13:34.542 --> 13:36.333
-LARRY, GET HIS PANTS!

13:42.750 --> 13:46.000
[GROANS]

13:46.041 --> 13:47.250
-I--

13:47.291 --> 13:49.834
I ACTUALLY HAVE NO IDEA

13:47.291 --> 13:49.834
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

13:49.875 --> 13:51.542
-HARMON DID NOT LIE.

13:51.583 --> 13:54.166
THAT WAS BETTER THAN ANY DRUG

13:51.583 --> 13:54.166
I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!

13:54.208 --> 13:55.000
I WAS--

13:55.041 --> 13:56.166
I WAS TRIPPING BALLS!

13:56.208 --> 14:00.333
I SAW MY WHOLE LIFE FLASH

13:56.208 --> 14:00.333
BEFORE MY EYES.

14:00.375 --> 14:02.834
I MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE

14:00.375 --> 14:02.834
SOME PHONE CALLS.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.917
-LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING

14:06.250 --> 14:07.917
ON IN MY ROOM, HUH?

14:15.917 --> 14:17.125
SHIT!

14:22.750 --> 14:24.625
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED

14:22.750 --> 14:24.625
IN HERE?

14:27.250 --> 14:28.041
HEY.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.083
EXCUSE ME.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.291
DID YOU SEE ANYBODY

14:29.125 --> 14:31.291
COME IN HERE?

14:31.333 --> 14:32.542
NO?

14:35.417 --> 14:37.709
-SOMETHING TELLS ME OUR

14:35.417 --> 14:37.709
OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR DOESN'T

14:37.750 --> 14:39.709
APPRECIATE MY SENSE OF HUMOR--

14:39.750 --> 14:42.875
AS MUCH AS THE STATE OF NEBRASKA

14:39.750 --> 14:42.875
APPRECIATED HIS

14:42.917 --> 14:44.166
WIFE'S BREASTS.

14:54.959 --> 14:56.166
-MORAN?

15:00.875 --> 15:02.166
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR ROOM.

15:05.458 --> 15:06.667
EVERYBODY LIKED IT.

15:11.208 --> 15:12.417
I'M SORRY.

15:15.166 --> 15:17.375
-DID HE JUST DO A SCENE

15:15.166 --> 15:17.375
FROM THE MOVIE--

15:17.417 --> 15:18.458
-TOP GUN?

15:18.500 --> 15:20.750
PROBABLY THE BEST

15:18.500 --> 15:20.750
MOVIE EVER MADE.

15:20.792 --> 15:22.709
I OFTEN SEE MYSELF AS

15:20.792 --> 15:22.709
A THIN VAL KILMER.

15:26.291 --> 15:30.417
NARRATOR: IT'S THE FINAL DAY OF

15:26.291 --> 15:30.417
PRACTICE AFTER A TUMULTUOUS

15:30.458 --> 15:32.417
WEEK FOR THE MOUNTAIN GOATS.

15:32.458 --> 15:35.583
WILL MARTY DANIELS BE ABLE TO

15:32.458 --> 15:35.583
FOCUS HIS TEAM ON WINNING

15:35.625 --> 15:37.417
SATURDAY'S GAME?

15:37.458 --> 15:39.542
-WELL, TO BE HONEST,

15:37.458 --> 15:39.542
THE WEEK HAS GONE

15:39.583 --> 15:40.959
BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.917
