01:55.240 --> 01:56.880
Why are we here again?

01:56.920 --> 01:58.440
Your social life

01:58.441 --> 01:59.960
is getting more exciting.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.680
Your wardrobe should match it!

02:02.720 --> 02:04.320
- You need new clothes.
- Sure.

02:04.360 --> 02:07.240
But you know, these clothes...

02:07.280 --> 02:08.759
aren't exactly "new."

02:08.800 --> 02:11.200
You gotta start somewhere.

02:11.240 --> 02:14.000
And I love vintage clothes.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.520
My mom and I...

02:15.560 --> 02:17.120
We buy all this lovely

02:17.121 --> 02:18.680
secondhand stuff

02:18.720 --> 02:19.980
and then alter it

02:19.981 --> 02:21.240
to make it fashionable.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.320
Yeah?

02:22.360 --> 02:23.400
That's pretty cool!

02:25.800 --> 02:27.280
Ooh,

02:27.281 --> 02:28.760
this would look great on you.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.040
Try it on!

02:30.080 --> 02:32.280
Uh... I don't know.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.120
It's a little much.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.360
Can I help you find anything?

02:36.400 --> 02:37.820
She needs

02:37.821 --> 02:39.240
something sophisticated,

02:39.280 --> 02:40.720
yet kind of funky.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.480
What do you think of this?

02:53.200 --> 02:54.320
Try it on!

03:05.600 --> 03:06.800
I really like the pattern

03:06.801 --> 03:08.000
and material.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.140
It's close,

03:09.141 --> 03:10.240
but it's not quite...

03:10.280 --> 03:12.160
Not quite Mia?

03:12.200 --> 03:13.560
Yeah.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.840
Mmm...

03:14.880 --> 03:17.320
You know, with a few alterations

03:17.360 --> 03:18.640
I could make something

03:18.641 --> 03:19.920
really fresh.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.120
Ooo-kay...

03:28.160 --> 03:29.760
- Do you really think
- it looks okay?

03:29.800 --> 03:31.920
- I mean,
- I never wear stuff like this.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.600
Are you kidding?

03:33.640 --> 03:35.920
It's totally you.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.440
Cute dress, Mia!

03:37.480 --> 03:38.800
Thanks!

03:38.801 --> 03:40.120
I can't take all the credit...

03:42.200 --> 03:44.080
Oh, boy.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.760
Violetta's Alpha Chicks.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.600
Brace yourself.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.920
Well, look who's all dressed up?

03:49.960 --> 03:51.200
Actually...

03:51.201 --> 03:52.440
she looks kinda nice.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.860
We'd better go...

03:53.861 --> 03:55.240
emergency Alpha-Chick meeting!

03:58.240 --> 04:00.240
I can't believe this.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.520
- We'll see
- who's the fairest in the land!

04:05.560 --> 04:07.120
I mean, uh, "school"!

04:10.360 --> 04:12.560
I told you, it'd look nice!

04:12.600 --> 04:14.280
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

04:16.079 --> 04:17.720
[Paula] Can we help you?

04:17.760 --> 04:19.720
[laughs uproariously]

04:21.480 --> 04:23.680
What is it? What's so funny?

04:23.720 --> 04:27.600
You... are wearing my dress!

04:27.640 --> 04:30.080
- A dress I practically gave away
- a year ago!

04:30.120 --> 04:31.220
- Huh?

04:31.221 --> 04:32.320
- As everybody knows,

04:32.360 --> 04:33.620
I never wear

04:33.621 --> 04:34.880
the same outfit twice.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.960
That dress was mine,

04:38.000 --> 04:39.740
until I dropped it off

04:39.741 --> 04:41.480
at some dinky secondhand store.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.040
Oh, you're Just Jealous

04:43.041 --> 04:44.560
because you could never

04:41.520 --> 04:44.560
pull off that look.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.060
Pssst.

04:46.061 --> 04:47.520
Don't make me laugh again.

04:47.560 --> 04:48.960
My sides are starting to hurt.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.060
Here. Take it back. I don't want

04:56.061 --> 04:57.960
your stinking dress anyway...

04:58.000 --> 04:59.360
Stinking?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.200
No, that's just your B.O.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.360
Okay, everybody out.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.440
OUT!

05:04.480 --> 05:05.800
[laugh mockingly]

05:12.440 --> 05:15.520
Wow, I feel terrible about that.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.120
Are you okay?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.900
Yeah...

05:21.901 --> 05:23.480
I just need to be alone a bit.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.880
That's okay.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.080
I'll see you later!

05:48.640 --> 05:49.640
Hi Mia.

05:49.641 --> 05:50.641
Say your password.

05:50.680 --> 05:51.860
"To know the path

05:51.861 --> 05:53.040
that you must follow,

05:53.080 --> 05:54.240
find a plant

05:54.241 --> 05:55.400
that likes to swallow."

06:10.400 --> 06:13.160
[screams]

06:16.800 --> 06:18.040
Aah!

06:19.040 --> 06:20.240
[sneezes]

06:20.280 --> 06:21.920
Sparkles are always pretty

06:21.960 --> 06:24.560
until they get up your nose.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.440
- I should let Yuko and Mo know
- I'm here.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.520
DING!

06:28.880 --> 06:31.000
I wonder where Onchao is.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.200
Onchao?

06:34.640 --> 06:35.680
Hmm.

06:35.720 --> 06:36.760
[grunts]

06:39.040 --> 06:41.040
Onchao?

06:41.080 --> 06:42.400
That's weird,

06:42.401 --> 06:43.720
I wonder where he is.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.760
Aah! There you are!

06:47.800 --> 06:49.280
[neighs]

06:51.640 --> 06:52.840
Look at you!

06:52.841 --> 06:54.040
All pretty and stuff.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.540
We're dressing him up for

06:55.541 --> 06:57.000
the Blush Flower Princess Ball.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.280
[giggles]

06:58.320 --> 07:00.320
That sounds... cute.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.440
- What is it?
- There's a competition to see

07:02.480 --> 07:03.600
Who's crowned

07:03.601 --> 07:04.721
the "Blush Flower Princess".

07:04.760 --> 07:06.560
- Girls are Judged
- on Intelligence,

07:06.600 --> 07:08.520
Charm, Beauty,

07:08.521 --> 07:10.440
Poise and Athletics.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.600
[Mia] Hmmm...

07:11.640 --> 07:13.280
Well good luck!

07:13.320 --> 07:15.360
Prince Mo chooses the winner.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.760
Prince Mo?

07:16.800 --> 07:18.840
Uh huh. Are you going to enter?

07:18.880 --> 07:20.240
No... I'm not really into

07:20.241 --> 07:21.600
that kind of thing.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.200
Mo's the Judge?

07:24.240 --> 07:26.360
Yep. You should try out too!

07:29.160 --> 07:30.800
[Yuko] Mia!

07:30.840 --> 07:32.080
There you are!

07:33.920 --> 07:35.240
Well, you certainly

07:35.241 --> 07:36.560
picked a busy time to return.

07:36.600 --> 07:37.800
So I hear.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.400
Some kind of... flower...

07:39.440 --> 07:40.880
Ball... thing, or something.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.320
That elf girl told me.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.880
[Mo] Oh, yes.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.280
She's a fine candidate

07:45.320 --> 07:46.800
for Blush Flower Princess...

07:46.840 --> 07:48.180
[excited chatter]

07:48.181 --> 07:49.520
It's Prince Mo!

07:49.560 --> 07:52.200
This has been going on all day.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.080
- I've never even seen
- this ball thing

07:54.120 --> 07:55.360
And it already bugs me.

07:56.080 --> 07:57.200
Aah!

07:57.240 --> 07:58.760
[giggles]

07:58.800 --> 08:00.160
Please tell me there's an oracle

08:00.200 --> 08:01.480
so we can get out of here!

08:01.520 --> 08:03.200
Right! Good. Important stuff.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.120
[Mo laughs]

08:05.960 --> 08:07.200
[giggling]

08:07.240 --> 08:09.480
It said: "To know the path

08:09.520 --> 08:11.120
that you must follow,

08:11.160 --> 08:12.640
find a plant

08:12.641 --> 08:14.120
that likes to swallow."

08:14.160 --> 08:15.760
- I hope it's not
- that big plant thing

08:15.800 --> 08:17.520
That tried to swallow Polytheus.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.120
- [Mo] Then you aim...
- [Yuko] Mmm?

08:19.160 --> 08:21.080
[Mo] Hold steady...

08:21.120 --> 08:22.200
- Mia!?

08:22.201 --> 08:23.280
- Hmm?

08:23.320 --> 08:24.920
- Oh, right.
- Whatever you said.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.120
[Mo]... and fire!!

08:26.160 --> 08:27.560
So, have you ever entered

08:27.600 --> 08:28.740
the Blush Flower

08:28.741 --> 08:29.880
Princess contest?

08:29.920 --> 08:31.240
Are you kidding?! Do I look like

08:31.241 --> 08:32.559
a girly girl to you?

08:32.600 --> 08:33.640
Right. Same here.

08:33.640 --> 08:34.679
Who needs it, right?

08:35.720 --> 08:37.159
[giggling and laughing]

08:38.840 --> 08:40.056
- I will if you will.
- I will if you will.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.679
I was meaning to compliment you

08:41.720 --> 08:43.600
- on your speech yesterday.
- Thank you.

08:43.640 --> 08:44.800
I'll definitely

08:44.801 --> 08:45.960
keep my eye on you today.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.680
- [Yuko] Alright, girls...
- move along.

08:47.720 --> 08:50.000
Official Trumptus business here.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.840
Remember the Trumptus, Mo?

08:51.880 --> 08:53.560
Of course! Let's go...

08:54.880 --> 08:56.360
Come on, pretty boy...

08:56.400 --> 08:57.600
[neighs]

09:10.880 --> 09:13.280
Mo... I think I saw a shadow...

09:13.320 --> 09:14.480
ooover there.

09:14.481 --> 09:15.640
Could be a munc dragon!

09:15.680 --> 09:17.080
And you're not checking it out

09:17.081 --> 09:18.480
yourself because...

09:18.520 --> 09:20.160
Because I don't want

09:20.200 --> 09:22.160
- to undermine
- your princely authority.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.280
[sighs]

09:28.640 --> 09:29.900
Maybe you should

09:29.901 --> 09:31.160
keep your distance from Mo.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.520
You know, Just for today.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.080
He's pretty distracted.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.320
Uh... huh.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.380
Why are you looking at me

09:37.381 --> 09:38.400
like that?

09:38.440 --> 09:39.860
You want Mo all to yourself

09:39.861 --> 09:41.280
so you can "charm" him

09:41.320 --> 09:42.600
and win that

09:42.601 --> 09:43.880
Blush Flower Princess thing!

09:43.920 --> 09:45.640
- That's the craziest thing
- I ever heard!

09:45.680 --> 09:47.600
- And it bugs you
- that I might win.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.040
Don't get ahead of yourself.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.360
The way you fly,

09:50.400 --> 09:52.080
you'll be lucky if you finish.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.360
- I make up for my deficiencies
- in other ways

09:54.400 --> 09:55.820
That you don't...

09:55.821 --> 09:57.240
like charm, for instance.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.800
Oh, I'm not charming?

09:58.840 --> 10:00.200
Let's just say your charm

10:00.240 --> 10:01.720
could use some work.

10:01.760 --> 10:02.940
[gasps] Maybe I will win

10:02.941 --> 10:04.120
that contest!

10:04.160 --> 10:05.340
- Maybe I will!

10:05.341 --> 10:06.520
- Bring it on!

10:06.560 --> 10:08.200
[Mo] (CLEARS THROAT) Um...

10:08.201 --> 10:09.840
is everything alright?

10:09.880 --> 10:11.800
- Great. Why?
- Yeah. We're fine.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.280
- Humph!
- Humph!

10:20.880 --> 10:22.480
Okay, so, you guys have been

10:22.481 --> 10:24.080
so busy being weird

10:24.120 --> 10:25.420
you haven't even told me

10:25.421 --> 10:26.720
what we're looking for.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.300
Why don't you ask Mia

10:28.301 --> 10:29.840
since she's so charming?!

10:29.880 --> 10:31.680
[Mia] Ugh!

10:31.720 --> 10:33.460
Why don't you ask Yuko

10:33.461 --> 10:35.200
since she's such a good flyer?!

10:35.240 --> 10:36.600
[sighs] Do you know

10:36.601 --> 10:37.960
what we're looking for?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.420
- [neighs]

10:39.421 --> 10:40.840
- I don't speak unicorn,

10:40.880 --> 10:43.080
- but you still made more sense
- to me than those two.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.816
- I think we're looking for
- the big flower

10:44.840 --> 10:47.160
That tried to eat Polytheus.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.940
Okay.

10:48.941 --> 10:50.680
Let's split up and look around.

10:50.720 --> 10:51.960
- Hmmumph!
- Hmmumph!

10:56.920 --> 10:57.960
[distant murmur]

11:01.920 --> 11:04.400
[neighs]

11:04.440 --> 11:05.480
Onchao?

11:06.960 --> 11:08.720
Guys!

11:08.760 --> 11:09.880
[Mo] He found it!

11:09.920 --> 11:11.560
[Mia] Good work, Onchao!

11:11.600 --> 11:12.680
[Yuko] It's even uglier

11:12.681 --> 11:13.760
than I remembered.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.320
Reminds me of someone I know...

11:15.360 --> 11:16.680
Really?

11:16.681 --> 11:18.000
Reminds me of someone I know.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.520
Why are you two fighting?

11:19.560 --> 11:20.800
She's fighting.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.120
I'm above that kind of thing.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.320
She's the one fighting.

11:23.360 --> 11:24.680
I'm nicer than her, right?

11:24.720 --> 11:26.760
I think you're both pretty nice

11:26.800 --> 11:28.280
most of the time.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.920
But right now

11:29.921 --> 11:31.520
you're both kinda scary.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.640
What exactly did the Oracle say?

11:33.680 --> 11:35.360
It said: "To know the path

11:35.361 --> 11:37.040
that you must follow,

11:37.080 --> 11:38.480
find a plant

11:38.481 --> 11:39.880
that likes to swallow."

11:39.920 --> 11:40.920
Well, this flower

11:40.921 --> 11:41.921
will eat anything.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.360
Right.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.000
- It even tried to
- swallow Polytheus.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.360
Be careful!!!

11:46.400 --> 11:48.240
Ah!

11:48.280 --> 11:49.680
Thank you, Mo.

11:49.720 --> 11:52.360
Your reflexes are so fast.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.880
[Yuko] Ahem! Ahem!

11:56.200 --> 11:58.800
Let's see if I can pry it open.

11:58.840 --> 11:59.880
[grunts with effort]

12:02.120 --> 12:03.240
It won't budge.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.560
I have an idea.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.080
Why not dangle some food

12:06.120 --> 12:07.960
- in front of
- the plant's mouth and,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.080
- When it opens to take a bite,
- we can look inside.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.600
That's a smart idea, Yuko.

12:11.640 --> 12:12.880
You hear that, Mia?

12:12.920 --> 12:14.520
Smart.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.040
And also...

12:16.080 --> 12:17.240
athletic.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.040
Yuko!

12:21.080 --> 12:22.320
[Mo] Grab her!

12:22.360 --> 12:23.680
[grunt with effort]

12:27.520 --> 12:28.936
- Did you happen to see
- the Trumptus piece

12:28.960 --> 12:30.720
While you were being eaten?

12:30.760 --> 12:31.800
[laughs]

12:33.160 --> 12:34.760
I think so.

12:34.800 --> 12:35.880
Maybe you can send Mia in

12:35.881 --> 12:36.960
to double check.

12:38.320 --> 12:39.640
I have a better idea.

12:39.680 --> 12:40.840
Why don't we feed the plant

12:40.880 --> 12:42.320
something gross and bitter

12:42.360 --> 12:44.000
- so it throws up
- the Trumptus piece?

12:44.040 --> 12:45.400
Mia!

12:45.401 --> 12:46.760
That is an even smarter idea!

12:46.800 --> 12:47.840
[gasps]

12:47.880 --> 12:49.200
Even smarter.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.520
[huffs]

12:51.560 --> 12:53.040
- This cactus
- ought to do the trick.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.160
[sniffs]

12:58.200 --> 12:59.240
[chomps]

12:59.280 --> 13:01.720
[chews loudly]

13:03.360 --> 13:04.400
[burps]

13:12.480 --> 13:14.040
Well done, Mia!

13:14.080 --> 13:15.840
- Beauty and intelligence
- don't always come

13:15.880 --> 13:17.360
In the same package.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.480
Beauty and intelligence

13:18.481 --> 13:19.560
are over-rated.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.080
How many girls can do this?

13:22.400 --> 13:24.080
Don't be such a show off!

13:24.120 --> 13:25.480
Ugh! I'm the show off?!

13:25.481 --> 13:26.840
What about you?!

13:26.880 --> 13:28.640
Would somebody please tell me

13:28.641 --> 13:30.400
what's going on?

13:30.440 --> 13:33.360
We decided to enter...

13:33.400 --> 13:34.600
the Blush

13:34.601 --> 13:35.800
Flower Princess contest.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.120
Ohhhhhh.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.920
Well that explains that.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.500
I think you two would both make

13:41.501 --> 13:43.040
fine Blush flower Princesses.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.456
- Do you have
- your rainbow blush flowers yet?

13:46.480 --> 13:47.700
Uh oh.

13:47.701 --> 13:48.920
Rainbow Blush Flowers?

13:48.960 --> 13:50.240
Didn't Yuko tell you?

13:50.241 --> 13:51.520
Every girl in the contest

13:51.560 --> 13:52.780
has to wear a rainbow

13:52.781 --> 13:54.000
blush flower in her hair.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.800
- It's tradition.
- No.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.600
I forgot!

13:57.640 --> 13:59.400
Well, you'd better go find them.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.600
If there's any left...

14:09.000 --> 14:10.160
[laughs]

14:10.200 --> 14:12.640
Peace and quiet at last.

14:12.680 --> 14:13.760
Ah!

14:13.800 --> 14:15.280
Plant slime!

14:18.400 --> 14:19.800
Hey! What...?!

14:21.160 --> 14:22.840
Lemme go...

14:24.400 --> 14:26.040
This is ridiculous.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.540
I'm never gonna find

14:27.541 --> 14:29.000
a rainbow blush flower.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.400
[snorts]

14:30.440 --> 14:32.120
What's that?!

14:33.960 --> 14:35.880
You found one?!

14:35.920 --> 14:37.760
It's beautiful.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.760
[coughs]

14:41.800 --> 14:43.880
What?! Where'd you get that?!

14:43.920 --> 14:45.360
Just lucky, I guess.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.460
- Did you find one?

14:46.461 --> 14:47.520
- No.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.560
And I bet that was the last one.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.360
I'm sorry, Yuko.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.820
You know, when I was little

14:58.821 --> 15:00.240
I used to pretend

15:00.280 --> 15:01.640
I was wearing

15:01.641 --> 15:03.000
the Blush Flower Princess crown.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.920
I guess that'll never happen.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.260
Here...

15:11.261 --> 15:12.640
you deserve this more than I do.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.720
No. It's yours.

15:14.760 --> 15:15.800
You found it.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.040
[neigh]

15:18.040 --> 15:19.680
I had help.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.120
Thanks, little guy!

15:23.160 --> 15:25.600
- Whaddya say
- we just go to the Ball together?

15:25.640 --> 15:26.880
Sounds perfect!

15:28.760 --> 15:30.060
Well we can't go the ball

15:30.061 --> 15:31.360
looking like this! Come on!

15:31.400 --> 15:32.720
Hurry hurry hurry!

15:37.480 --> 15:38.880
Uggh...

15:38.920 --> 15:40.200
Just...

15:43.880 --> 15:45.280
[grunts]

15:45.320 --> 15:47.040
Uuh, okay.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.680
This is a problem.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.600
[blows]

16:00.480 --> 16:01.520
[sneezes]

16:09.720 --> 16:10.840
[neighs]

16:17.640 --> 16:18.720
Come on come on come on!

16:18.760 --> 16:19.880
It's starting!

16:19.920 --> 16:21.360
[distant cheering]

16:21.400 --> 16:23.800
Yuko, Mia, have you seen Mo?

16:23.840 --> 16:25.080
We thought he came back here

16:25.081 --> 16:26.320
with the Trumptus piece.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.620
[sighs] I haven't seen him

16:27.621 --> 16:28.880
all day.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.240
Can you find him?

16:30.280 --> 16:33.600
We can't start without him!

16:33.640 --> 16:35.296
- I hope something bad
- didn't happen to him.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.920
We gotta find him!

16:39.480 --> 16:40.760
Mo.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.520
- It's heading back
- toward the flower!

16:59.400 --> 17:01.200
Mo! Are you there?!

17:03.160 --> 17:04.440
[gasps]

17:04.480 --> 17:06.440
Hey. I thought I'd just

17:06.480 --> 17:08.040
hang around here for a while...!

17:08.079 --> 17:09.520
[gasps] Mo!

17:09.560 --> 17:11.000
Mmmm...

17:11.040 --> 17:12.359
Oh no!

17:12.400 --> 17:14.960
[Mo] Mmmm... mmmm...

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
[grunts] Hurry, Mia!

17:18.359 --> 17:19.720
[neighs]

17:19.760 --> 17:21.240
[Yuko] Mo!

17:23.079 --> 17:24.920
Woah! Agh!

17:24.960 --> 17:26.160
Gimme my dress!

17:26.200 --> 17:27.280
[grunts]

17:28.560 --> 17:30.160
[Mo] Wooo... That was close!

17:31.600 --> 17:33.080
But I still got

17:33.081 --> 17:34.560
the trumptus piece!

17:34.600 --> 17:36.640
Wow, you look great!

17:38.240 --> 17:39.520
And you...

17:39.560 --> 17:42.080
uhhhh... yeah.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.800
We can't wait for Mo any longer.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.760
Elf Citizens of Centopia!

17:53.800 --> 17:55.460
Welcome to

17:55.461 --> 17:57.120
the Blush Flower Princess Ball!

17:59.400 --> 18:03.120
[cheers and applause]

18:06.320 --> 18:08.640
Well. You're late.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.720
But at least it was worth it.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.000
At the sound of the horn,

18:14.001 --> 18:15.560
the contest to crown

18:15.600 --> 18:17.180
the Blush Flower Princess

18:17.181 --> 18:18.760
shall begin!

18:18.800 --> 18:20.080
Ready...

18:20.120 --> 18:21.160
[inhales deeply]

18:21.200 --> 18:23.480
PIIIPUPIIIPUPIII!!

18:27.840 --> 18:29.080
SPLASH! SPLASH!

18:44.520 --> 18:45.620
What are you waiting for?

18:45.621 --> 18:46.720
Get in there.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.280
I can't go in the contest.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.440
Look at my dress.

18:51.720 --> 18:52.840
Take mine.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.000
But what about you?

18:54.040 --> 18:55.480
Who am I kidding?

18:55.520 --> 18:57.080
- You're the real
- elf princess here.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.160
Come on...

19:01.240 --> 19:02.400
[gasps]

19:09.880 --> 19:11.240
[cheering and applause]

19:19.680 --> 19:21.160
Go, Yuko, go!

19:21.200 --> 19:22.400
It's your turn!

19:24.040 --> 19:25.560
Yeah! Way to go Yuko!

19:25.600 --> 19:27.000
Woo hoo!

19:33.160 --> 19:35.320
[cheer enthusiastically]

19:35.360 --> 19:36.880
You're doing great!

19:36.920 --> 19:38.560
- The beauty and
- poise section is next.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.680
Woo...

19:39.720 --> 19:40.960
My hair is a mess.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.600
It is not! Get in there!

19:42.640 --> 19:44.420
I can't!

19:44.421 --> 19:46.200
I don't do beauty and poise!

19:46.240 --> 19:48.440
- What was I thinking
- even entering this contest?!

19:48.480 --> 19:50.320
You can't give up now!

19:50.360 --> 19:52.440
Not when you're doing so well!

20:02.400 --> 20:03.600
[crowd gasps]

20:05.840 --> 20:07.360
[cheering and applause]

20:10.160 --> 20:11.760
[Raynor] Attention everyone!

20:11.800 --> 20:13.360
It is time for Prince Mo

20:13.400 --> 20:14.580
to crown

20:14.581 --> 20:15.760
the Blush Flower Princess!

20:15.800 --> 20:16.840
[giggle]

20:27.520 --> 20:29.760
Today, I was almost eaten

20:29.800 --> 20:30.980
by a giant flower!

20:30.981 --> 20:32.160
[crowd gasps]

20:32.200 --> 20:34.120
Luckily for me,

20:34.121 --> 20:36.040
I was saved by an Elf Girl!

20:36.080 --> 20:37.220
In saving me,

20:37.221 --> 20:38.360
she showed great skill,

20:38.400 --> 20:39.760
and unselfishness,

20:39.800 --> 20:41.000
with no concern

20:41.040 --> 20:42.320
for her fancy hair-do

20:42.360 --> 20:43.560
or beautiful gown.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.920
And to me,

20:44.960 --> 20:46.320
that shows real grace,

20:46.360 --> 20:47.920
and true beauty,

20:47.960 --> 20:49.240
that is worthy of

20:49.241 --> 20:50.520
A Blush Flower Princess.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.000
Congratulations.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.200
[crowd] (CHEERING) Yaaay!

20:56.720 --> 21:00.400
[♪♪♪]

21:03.560 --> 21:05.080
Would you care to dance?

21:07.760 --> 21:09.520
Why are you dancing with me?

21:09.560 --> 21:11.056
- Shouldn't you be
- dancing with Yuko?

21:11.080 --> 21:12.840
Oh, no. She's too busy.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.840
- The Rainbow
- Blush Flower Princess

21:14.880 --> 21:16.240
Has to collect

21:16.241 --> 21:17.600
all the rainbow Blush Flowers.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.400
But that doesn't sound very fun!

21:19.440 --> 21:20.920
We should go help her.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.760
- One for all and all for one,
- right?

21:26.160 --> 21:27.640
[laughing]

21:33.280 --> 21:34.640
[neighs]

21:38.600 --> 21:40.240
Right on cue, as usual.

21:40.241 --> 21:41.880
Looks like I have to go.

21:41.920 --> 21:42.960
You think maybe

21:42.961 --> 21:44.000
you'll enter next year?

21:44.040 --> 21:45.680
I'd never be able to compete

21:45.720 --> 21:46.740
with the real

21:46.741 --> 21:47.760
Blush Flower Princess.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.680
No, you won't.

21:49.720 --> 21:51.120
But you better try!

21:53.120 --> 21:54.560
Bye guys!

21:59.960 --> 22:01.160
That went well.

22:03.240 --> 22:04.380
[Paula] Mia!

22:04.381 --> 22:05.520
There you are.

22:05.560 --> 22:06.840
I've been looking everywhere

22:06.841 --> 22:08.120
for you.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.040
- I just wanted to be
- on my own for a bit.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.960
- Am I disturbing?
- No, don't worry.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.520
Oh good.

22:13.560 --> 22:14.620
Because I have

22:14.621 --> 22:15.680
a new outfit for you.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.180
And this one definitely

22:17.181 --> 22:18.640
didn't belong to Violetta.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.120
Ah!

22:24.160 --> 22:25.580
A few alterations

22:25.581 --> 22:27.000
around the waist.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.720
But, other than that,

22:28.721 --> 22:30.400
it will be perfect.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.120
For me?

22:32.160 --> 22:33.640
Where did you get this from?

22:33.680 --> 22:35.020
My mom and I made it

22:35.021 --> 22:36.360
a while ago.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.200
It's one of my favourites.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.480
But I want you to have it.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.920
Are you sure?

22:40.960 --> 22:42.760
This is REALLY pretty.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.720
Of course!

22:44.760 --> 22:47.000
Wow, thanks Paula!

22:47.040 --> 22:48.040
This is one hand-me-down

22:48.041 --> 22:49.041
I'd be proud to wear!

22:50.305 --> 22:56.384
