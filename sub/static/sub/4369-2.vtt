00:04.545 --> 00:06.127
SHELBY: Previously on
 Best Friends Whenever...

00:06.127 --> 00:09.260
I'm so excited
that my best friend
is living with me forever.

00:09.260 --> 00:10.431
My whole family loves you.

00:10.431 --> 00:12.223
Your brothers
definitely love me.

00:12.223 --> 00:13.844
I'm giving her
flowers, Chet.

00:13.844 --> 00:15.936
No, I'm giving
her flowers, Bret.

00:18.189 --> 00:20.481
Barry, open up.

00:20.481 --> 00:22.193
Smell this.
 Ugh!

00:22.193 --> 00:23.314
Why did I do that?

00:23.314 --> 00:24.905
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

00:26.107 --> 00:27.358
Check out our new
chest hair machine!

00:27.358 --> 00:29.200
BARRY: It's not
a chest hair
machine, Renaldo.

00:31.112 --> 00:32.283
(BOTH SCREAMING)

00:36.036 --> 00:38.209
I was worried
maybe that laser
did something to us.

00:38.209 --> 00:41.502
It could have sent you
to another dimension
or made you time travel.

00:41.502 --> 00:42.923
Why are we
in my bedroom?

00:42.923 --> 00:44.665
Maybe that's it!
We think about a time

00:44.665 --> 00:46.627
while we're hugging
or touching or something.

00:46.627 --> 00:48.509
Did we just
figure out
time travel?

00:48.509 --> 00:49.880
I think we did.

00:56.227 --> 00:58.439
There is no possible way
you two are time travelers.

00:58.439 --> 00:59.520
But we're time travelers.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.273
Explain that!

01:02.273 --> 01:05.105
Granted. Physicists
have postulated
that it's possible,

01:05.105 --> 01:06.987
but the probability that you
are time travelers

01:06.987 --> 01:09.320
is 5 times 10
to the negative 1 billion.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.613
That's .00000...
Stay with me...

01:12.613 --> 01:13.954
...000...

01:13.954 --> 01:15.406
There's a billion more
to go.

01:15.406 --> 01:17.408
...000...
 Let's prove it. Bump me.

01:17.408 --> 01:19.460
Ooh, I like that we're
calling it that now.

01:20.751 --> 01:22.082
I will grant you,

01:22.082 --> 01:23.704
physicists have postulated
that it's possible...

01:23.704 --> 01:26.006
ALL: But the probability
that you are time travelers

01:26.006 --> 01:28.419
is 5 times 10 to
the negative 1 billion.

01:28.419 --> 01:30.471
That's .00000...

01:30.471 --> 01:32.263
Stay with us.
 ...000...

01:32.263 --> 01:34.515
There's a billion more to go.
 ...000...

01:34.515 --> 01:37.178
Either you're time travelers
or you're now
as smart as I am.

01:37.978 --> 01:40.221
You're time travelers!

01:40.221 --> 01:42.393
We had to relive
that speech 15 times

01:42.393 --> 01:43.524
before we could memorize it.

01:43.524 --> 01:45.025
I wrote it on my hand.

01:47.358 --> 01:49.570
Welcome to our time.

01:51.232 --> 01:52.693
If I can figure out
how it happened,

01:52.693 --> 01:54.825
I'll be the greatest
scientist since Einstein.

01:54.825 --> 01:57.908
And he didn't develop
his theory of relativity
until he was 28.

01:57.908 --> 01:59.240
I'm 15!

01:59.240 --> 02:01.622
E equals MC
in your face, Albert!

02:02.913 --> 02:05.376
To be clear, I know
E equals MC squared.

02:05.376 --> 02:07.208
I altered the equation
for the sake of the burn.

02:08.839 --> 02:10.751
We're gonna have so much fun
with time travel.

02:10.751 --> 02:11.962
I was just gonna say that.

02:11.962 --> 02:13.174
Well, let's go back
so you can say it.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.215
Nah, you nailed it.

02:14.215 --> 02:15.516
Aw, let's go back to
when you said I nailed it.

02:15.516 --> 02:17.388
That was so sweet.

02:17.388 --> 02:18.809
Guys! You need to be careful.

02:18.809 --> 02:20.601
If people find out
you have special powers,

02:20.601 --> 02:23.143
they'll lock you up in a lab
and experiment on you.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.937
That's certainly what
I would do if I had more space
in the Winnebago.

02:26.937 --> 02:30.441
Wait, do you think
that's what was going on in
the future lab we saw?

02:30.441 --> 02:31.362
What future lab?

02:31.362 --> 02:33.444
Just some crazy mystery lab

02:33.444 --> 02:35.986
where me and Shelbs
were strapped to
these glowing tables.

02:35.986 --> 02:38.369
Don't worry, we are
never going there again.

02:38.369 --> 02:39.370
Smack it!

02:43.914 --> 02:45.546
We're in the
crazy mystery lab again!

02:45.546 --> 02:46.957
Why would someone
do this to us?

02:46.957 --> 02:48.249
We're gonna have
to figure this out!

02:48.249 --> 02:49.420
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

02:49.420 --> 02:51.051
Someone's coming!

02:51.051 --> 02:53.214
(BOTH SCREAMING)

02:54.134 --> 02:55.426
(ALL SCREAMING)

02:55.426 --> 02:56.717
Why are you screaming?

02:56.717 --> 02:57.888
We just went back there!

02:57.888 --> 02:59.430
Why are you
screaming?

02:59.430 --> 03:00.601
We're out of chips!

03:03.143 --> 03:05.306
Did somebody say "magic"?

03:07.808 --> 03:09.690
Pretty sure nobody
said "magic."

03:10.981 --> 03:13.574
I am the Amazing Chet!

03:13.574 --> 03:17.528
I am the Also Amazing Bret!

03:17.528 --> 03:21.492
Prepare for three hours
of illusions.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.745
Skip to the end, Chet.

03:24.745 --> 03:27.958
The dove in my pants is
nesting in my tender parts.

Making something to
give Diesel a little sazzle.

04:34.445 --> 04:35.396
(WHIMPERING)

04:38.899 --> 04:41.031
I don't know, Shelby,
a tiara?

04:41.031 --> 04:44.034
You're right, you're right.
The tiara doesn't work

04:44.034 --> 04:45.326
without the glasses.

04:48.459 --> 04:50.581
And I made
something for you, too.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.543
See, this is why
you're my girl.

04:52.543 --> 04:55.716
You love making stuff,
I love getting stuff.

04:55.716 --> 04:58.549
It's Shelby and Cyd's
Official Study Buddy Binder.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.592
Just in time for our
history test tomorrow.

05:01.592 --> 05:03.514
That's a mosaic
of us studying.

05:05.766 --> 05:07.558
This looks like
my actual hair.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.139
Did you get this
out of my brush?

05:09.139 --> 05:10.310
Well I certainly
didn't yank it out

05:10.310 --> 05:11.562
of your head
while you were sleeping

05:11.562 --> 05:12.853
like a hair-plucking nutjob.

05:14.695 --> 05:16.567
Now come on,

05:16.567 --> 05:18.439
let's get studying,
study buddy.

05:18.439 --> 05:20.441
You know, you're
taking a sweet thing
like being buddies

05:20.441 --> 05:24.445
and making it all dirty
by slapping that
"study" stank on it.

05:24.445 --> 05:27.538
Come on, Cyd,
we have to study so we can
go to the same college,

05:27.538 --> 05:29.500
marry best friends,
have kids,

05:29.500 --> 05:30.791
our kids can marry each other,

05:30.791 --> 05:32.583
have kids and we
can be grandmas together.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.545
Is this all about us being
grandmas together?

05:34.545 --> 05:36.006
When has it not been?

05:37.548 --> 05:38.839
But none of that happens

05:38.839 --> 05:41.171
if we show up to
Ms. Nesbit's test unprepared.

05:42.923 --> 05:44.224
Time for the test.

05:44.224 --> 05:45.886
We jumped forward
to Ms. Nesbit's test.

05:45.886 --> 05:48.308
And we're unprepared!

05:48.308 --> 05:51.522
This test is so hard,
even I don't know
some of the answers.

05:51.522 --> 05:53.103
Just kidding.
I know the answers,

05:53.103 --> 05:54.354
but you won't!

05:56.356 --> 05:58.649
Whoa, Barry,
what happened to your face?

06:01.532 --> 06:03.073
I just told you before class.

06:03.073 --> 06:05.616
Oh, that wasn't us.
 We just jumped here
from yesterday.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.658
Of course!
You're time travelers.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.950
You can go back and
stop this from happening.

06:09.950 --> 06:12.953
Sorry, Barry. We made a pact
to never use time travel

06:12.953 --> 06:15.375
to stop hilarious things
from happening to you.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.340
This is so messed up.

06:20.340 --> 06:22.843
Whenever we think
about the test, we jump there.

06:22.843 --> 06:24.384
How can we study for a test

06:24.384 --> 06:26.056
without thinking
about the test?

06:26.056 --> 06:29.600
You know, your grandma plan
is based on us going
to college together,

06:29.600 --> 06:30.721
not a good college.

06:32.773 --> 06:34.975
No, we have to go
to a good college

06:34.975 --> 06:37.357
so we can found
Cyd and Shelby Incorporated.

06:37.357 --> 06:39.650
What is Cyd and Shelby
Incorporated?

06:39.650 --> 06:42.152
An environmentally friendly,
equal-opportunity employer

06:42.152 --> 06:44.234
that facilitates
intergenerational
communication

06:44.234 --> 06:47.407
and everyone sits
on exercise balls.

06:47.407 --> 06:51.702
I'm into any job
where sick abs are in
the mission statement.

06:51.702 --> 06:55.245
Then come on, we have to
study for Ms. Nesbit's class
without touching each other.

06:55.245 --> 06:56.707
Studying? I'm out.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.038
Cyd...
 What?

06:59.089 --> 07:00.711
Time for the test.

07:00.711 --> 07:01.462
BOTH: Dang it!

07:03.213 --> 07:05.045
We have to focus on
not touching each other.

07:05.045 --> 07:06.386
But we touch each other
all the time.

07:06.386 --> 07:07.548
Because we're best friends.

07:07.548 --> 07:09.049
We are best friends.

07:09.049 --> 07:10.050
BOTH: Aw!

07:11.852 --> 07:13.353
Time for the test.

07:13.353 --> 07:14.975
BOTH: Dang it!

07:14.975 --> 07:17.397
We're here because
we hugged each other.

07:17.397 --> 07:18.769
That is a weird thing to say.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.907
If you're watching this,
it means I, Barry Eisenberg,

07:26.907 --> 07:29.239
have unlocked the secrets
of time travel.

07:29.239 --> 07:30.911
And you're standing in
the welcome center

07:30.911 --> 07:33.664
of the Barry Eisenberg
Time Travel Institute.

07:33.664 --> 07:35.746
Please, sign the guest book
and tell us,

07:35.746 --> 07:37.748
when do you come from?

07:38.789 --> 07:40.460
Hi, I'm Naldo.

07:42.543 --> 07:44.254
If we can re-create
time travel,

07:44.254 --> 07:46.887
this will be one of the most
important videos of all time.

07:46.887 --> 07:49.089
Right up there with
Armstrong on the moon,

07:49.089 --> 07:51.351
or Carl Sagan's Pale Blue Dot,

07:51.351 --> 07:52.553
or...
 The video of the guy

07:52.553 --> 07:53.974
who finds a pickle
under his hat and says,

07:53.974 --> 07:55.475
"How'd that pickle get there?"

07:55.475 --> 07:57.097
That's you.
 It is?

07:59.439 --> 08:00.771
How'd that pickle get there?

08:02.152 --> 08:03.233
I put it there.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.569
Renaldo, Shelby and Cyd
have achieved

08:08.569 --> 08:10.871
the greatest scientific
milestone of all time.

08:10.871 --> 08:13.203
It is our duty
as men of science, nay,

08:13.203 --> 08:15.075
as members of the human race,

08:15.075 --> 08:17.668
to unlock the secrets
of their discovery.

08:17.668 --> 08:18.789
So we can take credit for it.

08:20.380 --> 08:21.582
When I say the word,

08:21.582 --> 08:24.044
set the oscillator to 400
and blast me.

08:24.044 --> 08:26.386
But Shelby and Cyd said
they were hugging
when the laser hit them.

08:26.386 --> 08:29.219
I'm not sure I like
what you're suggesting.

08:29.219 --> 08:31.051
Bring it in, buddy.
For science.

08:33.183 --> 08:34.183
This is nice.

08:35.726 --> 08:36.897
Just zap us already!

08:42.312 --> 08:43.443
Do you think it worked?

08:43.443 --> 08:44.985
Of course it didn't work.

08:44.985 --> 08:47.648
Okay, but if we go outside
and get eaten by a dinosaur,

08:47.648 --> 08:49.740
I'm gonna be like,
"I told you so! Ahhh!

08:49.740 --> 08:52.532
"It hurts! Why did
you bring me here?"

08:52.532 --> 08:53.704
That's what I'm gonna be like.

08:59.079 --> 09:00.791
Ugh, history.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.963
Why are we studying
stuff that's already happened?

09:02.963 --> 09:04.835
We should be studying stuff
that hasn't happened.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.587
That's the stuff
you need to know.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.630
We're never
gonna learn all this.

09:09.630 --> 09:11.802
If only we knew
what was gonna be on the test.

09:13.383 --> 09:14.765
Oh, no. That's the
face you made

09:14.765 --> 09:16.637
just before we
got thrown into mall jail.

09:17.267 --> 09:18.268
(GRUNTS)

09:19.850 --> 09:21.021
Time for the test.

09:21.021 --> 09:23.774
Ha! Now we know
what's gonna be on the test.

09:23.774 --> 09:25.856
That doesn't make sense
to any of you

09:25.856 --> 09:27.648
but she knows
what I'm talking about.

09:33.113 --> 09:35.866
I can't believe we jumped
forward in time

09:35.866 --> 09:38.538
and stole a test
from the future!
That's like

09:38.538 --> 09:40.540
cheating!
 Exactly!

09:40.540 --> 09:43.293
It's like cheating.
But it isn't.

09:43.293 --> 09:45.666
The same way this library card

09:45.666 --> 09:46.917
is like a credit card,

09:46.917 --> 09:48.669
but all I can
buy with it is books.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.591
Cyd, cheating is wrong

09:51.591 --> 09:53.173
and you have to
give those books back.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.977
Shelbs, using this test
is not cheating.

09:56.977 --> 09:58.388
If you have a
photographic memory

09:58.388 --> 09:59.980
and you use it to ace tests,

09:59.980 --> 10:01.682
is it cheating?

10:01.682 --> 10:03.223
No.
 Of course not!

10:03.223 --> 10:04.815
Because a photographic memory

10:04.815 --> 10:06.186
is an awesome power.

10:06.186 --> 10:09.569
Well, time travel
is our awesome power,

10:09.569 --> 10:11.491
and with awesome power
comes awesome...

10:11.491 --> 10:12.863
Responsibility.
 -Shortcuts.

10:13.824 --> 10:15.155
We are not cheating.

10:15.155 --> 10:16.326
Shelby,

10:16.326 --> 10:18.909
there's no way we're
gonna do well on this test.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.661
This is the only way
we'll stay on track

10:20.661 --> 10:22.743
for college and
Cyd and Shelby Incorporated,

10:22.743 --> 10:25.796
and everything in our
Happily Ever After binder.

10:25.796 --> 10:27.708
You read the
Happily Ever After binder?

10:27.708 --> 10:29.840
There's really
a Happily Ever After binder?

10:29.840 --> 10:31.341
I thought I was
making that up.

10:33.513 --> 10:35.806
Can we just do
this test my way?

10:35.806 --> 10:37.557
Please? For me?

10:38.969 --> 10:41.892
I mean, it's not like
we have the answers.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.563
We have the questions.

10:43.563 --> 10:44.935
Like a study guide.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.857
Exactly! A study guide

10:46.857 --> 10:48.729
is what I should
have called it

10:48.729 --> 10:50.320
when you asked,
"Is this cheating?"

10:51.822 --> 10:53.653
Well, I guess I didn't need
to waste that time

10:53.653 --> 10:54.735
making our study binder.

10:54.735 --> 10:57.738
You didn't waste your time.
Diesel loves that thing.

11:01.581 --> 11:04.544
Now that he finally
has glasses,
I think he can read.

11:11.882 --> 11:14.134
Again, nothing!

11:14.134 --> 11:16.386
I wouldn't call the last
30 seconds nothing.

11:18.889 --> 11:21.101
I can't believe Shelby and Cyd
created time travel

11:21.101 --> 11:24.014
by bumbling into my lab
like a couple of isotopes.

11:24.014 --> 11:25.976
Barry.
 Fine.

11:25.976 --> 11:29.609
I'll put a quarter in the
"science words that
sound like swears" jar.

11:29.609 --> 11:31.812
There's no reason
to call the girls names.

11:31.812 --> 11:33.573
I'm sure they didn't mean
to discover time travel.

11:33.573 --> 11:34.905
It was an accident.

11:34.905 --> 11:37.317
That's it! Some of
the greatest
scientific discoveries

11:37.317 --> 11:38.989
have been total
accidents!

11:38.989 --> 11:40.280
I've been going about this
all wrong.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.912
I don't need logic and reason,

11:41.912 --> 11:44.414
I need chaos and idiocy.

11:44.414 --> 11:46.416
Did somebody say "magic"?

11:48.879 --> 11:51.211
Get ready for the
teleportation trick.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.883
I enter here...

11:52.883 --> 11:54.714
But now I am here!

11:56.426 --> 11:57.968
Were they amazed?

11:57.968 --> 11:59.429
Way to go, Bret!

11:59.429 --> 12:01.972
Now they know
there's two of us!

12:01.972 --> 12:03.934
Because you told them, Chet!

12:03.934 --> 12:06.186
I'm gonna use my
magic wand on you!

12:06.186 --> 12:09.059
I'm gonna use my
magic wand on you!

12:09.059 --> 12:11.441
Ow! Ow!
 Ow! Ow!

12:13.273 --> 12:16.616
This is it! Genius
born of pure stupidity.

12:16.616 --> 12:18.738
Ow! Ow!
 Ow! Ow!

12:24.244 --> 12:25.705
BOTH: Whoa!

12:31.631 --> 12:34.875
And now Chet and I
will disappear!

12:40.760 --> 12:41.972
Do I look okay?

12:42.933 --> 12:43.934
No.

12:49.309 --> 12:52.943
This test is so hard,
even I don't know
some of the answers.

12:52.943 --> 12:54.484
Just kidding.
I know the answers,

12:54.484 --> 12:55.695
but you won't!

12:57.858 --> 13:01.321
I want you to jump back
and make sure
this doesn't happen.

13:01.321 --> 13:03.283
Who's to say we haven't
tried a bunch of times

13:03.283 --> 13:05.075
and it always
ends up this way?

13:05.075 --> 13:06.827
Have you?
 Who's to say?

13:10.080 --> 13:13.083
I am so pumped you're
doing this my way.
Aren't you pumped?

13:13.083 --> 13:14.674
Super pumped.

13:14.674 --> 13:16.216
Are you sure you're pumped?

13:16.216 --> 13:18.008
'Cause you're doing that
scratchy thing you do

13:18.008 --> 13:19.589
when you get worked up.

13:19.589 --> 13:23.093
No, no, this is not
one of my stress rashes.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.305
This is just my skin
being excited.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.306
Woot-woot!

13:31.231 --> 13:32.732
Time's up, flunkers!

13:32.732 --> 13:34.274
Please put your pencils down

13:34.274 --> 13:36.196
and get ready to
disappoint your parents.

13:38.198 --> 13:40.030
Shelby, are you sure
you're okay?

13:40.030 --> 13:42.072
'Cause that's looking a lot
like you're stress-scratching.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.944
(LAUGHING) No, no, no stress.

13:45.205 --> 13:46.576
BOTH: Da-dang!

13:48.408 --> 13:49.950
(HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING)

13:49.950 --> 13:51.952
Sorry, it's just,
you look like a monster.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:01.421 --> 14:04.674
That really looks like
a full-blown stress rash.

14:04.674 --> 14:07.307
Getting the test early is
a bit of an adjustment for me,

14:07.307 --> 14:08.638
but it's fine.

14:08.638 --> 14:10.310
In fact, I think
the rash is going away.

14:10.310 --> 14:11.811
It doesn't even itch anymore.

14:11.811 --> 14:12.933
Oh, look, there's Ted.

14:17.687 --> 14:19.149
His name's not Ted.

14:19.149 --> 14:20.780
Oh, he just has
one of those Ted faces.

14:21.942 --> 14:24.034
I'm just so glad
you're feeling better,

14:24.034 --> 14:25.115
'cause this is awesome.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.117
We'll ace every test
from now on.

14:27.117 --> 14:28.828
You're gonna have to
change your name from

14:28.828 --> 14:31.041
from Shel-B to Shel-A!

14:31.041 --> 14:33.833
(LAUGHING) You're so funny!

14:35.045 --> 14:36.546
What are you doing?

14:36.546 --> 14:39.089
Nothing, just
friending around.

14:39.089 --> 14:41.051
I was just... (BELCHES)

14:42.422 --> 14:44.134
Did you just stress-belch?

14:44.134 --> 14:46.096
No, no, of course not.

14:46.096 --> 14:47.968
That was just a...
(BELCHES)

14:49.849 --> 14:53.063
Ugh! Were you burning
hair in your mouth?

14:58.518 --> 15:00.020
232 attempts

15:00.020 --> 15:03.733
and subject is no closer
to re-creating time travel.

15:03.733 --> 15:06.947
Subject is considering
switching area of study to

15:08.118 --> 15:09.289
the humanities.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.163
So there's not gonna be
a time travel institute?

15:13.163 --> 15:16.586
But I already got potatoes
to make Naldo bobbleheads
for the gift shop.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.462
How could science
have failed me?

15:23.093 --> 15:24.384
I give up.

15:24.384 --> 15:26.926
Maybe it's not even science.
Maybe it's some kind of magic.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.309
Did somebody say "magic"?

15:29.309 --> 15:31.431
Oh, shuds! I did say "magic"!

15:33.353 --> 15:34.814
The Great Chetdini

15:34.814 --> 15:38.268
will now escape from
the Chains of Doom!

15:38.268 --> 15:40.650
Lock me up,
The Great Bretdini.

15:47.737 --> 15:48.738
(THUD)

15:50.070 --> 15:52.332
I whacked my waist bone!

15:54.204 --> 15:55.955
This is a really good trick.

15:57.127 --> 16:00.750
Drag me off! Drag me off!

16:00.750 --> 16:02.882
Thank you! Thank you!

16:06.886 --> 16:08.548
I love Bretdini and Chetdini.

16:08.548 --> 16:11.931
Why? They've never
successfully performed
a single magic trick.

16:11.931 --> 16:13.093
But they keep trying.

16:13.093 --> 16:14.764
Maybe they shouldn't.

16:14.764 --> 16:15.935
Maybe I shouldn't.

16:15.935 --> 16:17.687
What are you talking about?

16:17.687 --> 16:19.309
When someone's
not good at something,

16:19.309 --> 16:21.771
they need to be
honest with themselves.

16:21.771 --> 16:24.364
Renaldo, the past two days
have been a complete failure.

16:24.364 --> 16:25.985
Science is the
only thing I love.

16:27.197 --> 16:29.069
What if I'm not good at it?

16:29.069 --> 16:31.281
No one ever succeeded
at anything by giving up.

16:32.612 --> 16:34.374
I believe in you, Barry.

16:34.374 --> 16:36.416
And, dude, it's
only been two days.

16:36.416 --> 16:38.248
It takes my dad three days
to smoke a brisket.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.542
So you're saying I could
solve this tomorrow?

16:43.623 --> 16:45.175
Not if you give up today.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.428
Renaldo,

16:48.428 --> 16:49.969
let's do this!

16:49.969 --> 16:53.183
Aw, yeah! Come on, Barry,
bobble with me.
 No.

16:53.183 --> 16:56.136
Bobble. Bobble.
Bobble. Bobble.
 No. No. No. No.

16:56.136 --> 16:57.557
See? That could've been me.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.644
Shelby, I'm starting
to worry about you.

17:04.644 --> 17:08.108
First the rash,
then the belching,
and now you're

17:08.108 --> 17:09.108
stress-eating.

17:12.952 --> 17:14.204
I'm not stress-eating.

17:14.204 --> 17:16.205
This is just a little
victory snack.

17:16.205 --> 17:17.537
I mean, we did something huge

17:17.537 --> 17:19.329
and we totally got
away with it.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.290
Hello, girls.

17:23.123 --> 17:26.256
That was nasty.

17:26.256 --> 17:29.879
I'm so sorry to interrupt,
but I just wanted to
give you your grades.

17:29.879 --> 17:32.512
You both got As.
How did you do it?

17:32.512 --> 17:33.973
We tried studying.

17:33.973 --> 17:35.935
I'm just gonna say,
believe the hype,

17:35.935 --> 17:36.936
it works.

17:37.767 --> 17:39.139
No one else got As.

17:39.139 --> 17:41.060
Not even the smart boy
with the janky eyebrows.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.353
But you two did.

17:47.277 --> 17:50.780
You seem a little
nervous there, Shelby.

17:50.780 --> 17:52.692
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

17:54.864 --> 17:57.747
You are stress-eating!
You can't go on like this.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.502
Girl, you're eating napkins.

18:04.544 --> 18:07.127
Tell Ms. Nesbit
what's bothering you.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.208
Maybe we should tell her.

18:08.208 --> 18:09.759
Maybe it'll make
you feel better.

18:09.759 --> 18:11.261
I feel fine. (COUGHS)

18:14.174 --> 18:15.385
Okay, we cheated!

18:15.385 --> 18:16.596
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

18:16.596 --> 18:18.178
That is the least
of your worries now.

18:18.178 --> 18:19.849
I am getting you
both expelled!

18:19.849 --> 18:21.351
But first, I gotta stop
by the science lab

18:21.351 --> 18:23.563
and get in the chem shower
for 35 to 45 minutes.

18:25.815 --> 18:27.727
Why did you do that?
I was handling it.

18:27.727 --> 18:30.109
You weren't handling it,
you were falling apart.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.731
Why did you let it
go this far?

18:31.731 --> 18:33.653
Well, because you asked me to.

18:33.653 --> 18:35.615
I would do anything for you.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.077
Shelby, we've been
best friends since
kindergarten

18:38.077 --> 18:40.540
and I know you'd do
anything for me,

18:40.540 --> 18:43.453
and I think maybe
I took advantage of that.

18:43.453 --> 18:46.246
I'm sorry.
 We were in it together.

18:46.246 --> 18:49.128
Like I said in mall jail,
"It may have been
your idea, but it took

18:49.128 --> 18:51.751
"both of us to make those
mannequins touch
each other's butts."

18:53.633 --> 18:55.715
Look, from now on,
if either of us

18:55.715 --> 18:57.517
feels uncomfortable
with something,

18:57.517 --> 18:59.259
we have to tell each other.

18:59.259 --> 19:00.890
Deal.

19:00.890 --> 19:04.184
Now let's go to the principal
and take our punishment.

19:04.184 --> 19:05.685
I am not comfortable
with that.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.863
Shelby, Cyd, you're just
in time for the big news.

19:13.863 --> 19:17.237
This morning, I received
an anonymous call that someone

19:17.237 --> 19:18.778
got a copy of the test.

19:18.778 --> 19:20.950
But don't worry,
I made a new test

19:20.950 --> 19:23.703
and it's so hard that
some of the history on it
didn't even happen!

19:25.995 --> 19:27.247
Thanks for tipping Nesbit off.

19:27.247 --> 19:28.498
Kind of had to.

19:28.498 --> 19:30.169
What we did
wasn't like cheating,

19:30.169 --> 19:31.421
it was cheating.

19:31.421 --> 19:32.552
I knew it wasn't
a study guide.

19:32.552 --> 19:33.713
I can't believe
you bought that.

19:33.713 --> 19:36.256
I can't believe you
sold it to me.

19:36.256 --> 19:39.349
I'm just glad we can
use time travel
to fix our mistakes.

19:39.349 --> 19:41.891
Besides, an A would
look weird on my report card.

19:41.891 --> 19:43.393
All those Cs would be like,

19:43.393 --> 19:44.474
"Whatcha you doin' here, A?

19:44.474 --> 19:45.975
"You think you're
better than us?"

19:47.607 --> 19:50.189
I want you to go back and
keep this from happening.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.362
Oh, we've been
to this timeline before.
We're prepared.

19:56.316 --> 19:58.117
This doesn't help.
 Helps us.

19:59.989 --> 20:01.531
You may begin now.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.995
This test is impossible.

20:05.995 --> 20:08.207
Hey, let's go back to when
Ms. Nesbit decided

20:08.207 --> 20:09.459
she wanted to be a teacher

20:09.459 --> 20:11.291
and convince her to be
anything else.

20:11.291 --> 20:12.632
I am not
uncomfortable with that.

20:14.334 --> 20:16.135
Now this test I can handle.

20:16.135 --> 20:18.298
Yeah, Ms. Johnson
is so much nicer.

20:21.761 --> 20:23.553
Louise Johnson,
you are under arrest

20:23.553 --> 20:25.144
for unpaid parking tickets.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.397
Keep 'em where I can see 'em.

20:29.439 --> 20:32.151
Officer Nesbit,
does this test still count?

20:32.151 --> 20:33.353
That's a weird thing to ask.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.199
For my next trick,

20:40.199 --> 20:42.282
I will need a volunteer
from the audience.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.533
Ooh! Me! Me!

20:43.533 --> 20:44.494
You, sir.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.916
We have never met before.
Is that correct?

20:46.916 --> 20:47.917
Never.

20:49.539 --> 20:51.961
If you will.

20:51.961 --> 20:53.833
That guy always gets
picked for these tricks.

20:55.375 --> 20:57.337
And now, levitation!

21:01.180 --> 21:04.384
I bet Bobble Renaldo
would've loved
being here for this.

21:04.384 --> 21:06.055
Who's to say he isn't?

21:11.481 --> 21:12.892
BOTH: Magic!

21:13.305 --> 21:19.507
