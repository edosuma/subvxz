00:12.617 --> 00:17.534
(whooshing)
(film rolling)

00:23.055 --> 00:25.638
(bright music)

00:32.947 --> 00:37.947
(film rolling)
(children playing)

00:59.663 --> 01:02.413
(birds chirping)

01:18.030 --> 01:23.030
(ominous music)
(birds chirping)

01:39.938 --> 01:43.271
- When it happens, it happens very fast.

01:44.986 --> 01:47.986
My family's gone and I am gone, too.

01:51.682 --> 01:55.349
It's very difficult
when you die so quickly.

01:57.260 --> 02:00.727
It makes you lost for a long time.

02:04.742 --> 02:09.242
(rustling)
(grunting)

02:13.381 --> 02:18.048
(dark music)
(grunting)

02:22.640 --> 02:25.473
(heavy breathing)

02:29.920 --> 02:32.587
(ominous music)

03:03.436 --> 03:06.269
(quietly sobbing)

03:08.267 --> 03:11.100
(heavy breathing)

03:36.219 --> 03:39.373
- [Emma] (shrieking) Mom!

03:39.373 --> 03:41.754
(sobbing)

03:41.754 --> 03:42.587
Mom!

03:43.616 --> 03:44.449
Wake up!

03:45.757 --> 03:46.924
Mommy, please!

03:48.189 --> 03:49.106
Wake, wake.

03:51.068 --> 03:51.901
Help!

03:53.053 --> 03:54.312
Please!

03:54.312 --> 03:56.476
Mom, please, please.

03:56.476 --> 03:58.643
(sobbing)

04:02.054 --> 04:03.054
Mom, please!

04:08.998 --> 04:11.665
(heavy panting)

04:12.849 --> 04:16.266
(light orchestral music)

04:28.645 --> 04:32.886
(distant police sirens wailing)

04:32.886 --> 04:34.969
- [Mom] Stop, stop, stop.

04:36.047 --> 04:37.714
It's okay, I'm okay.

04:47.157 --> 04:49.824
(door slamming)

05:03.224 --> 05:05.891
(keys jingling)

05:07.589 --> 05:10.000
- Your keys are still here.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.210
I'll grab some clothes.

05:13.358 --> 05:16.441
(footsteps thumping)

05:41.028 --> 05:42.361
We've got to go.

05:43.735 --> 05:44.822
Mom.

05:44.822 --> 05:46.405
He might come back.

05:52.897 --> 05:55.716
(distant police sirens wailing)

05:55.716 --> 05:57.883
(sighing)

06:00.594 --> 06:04.844
(car doors creaking open and shut)

06:07.828 --> 06:11.161
- [Mom] Maybe we should call the police.

06:12.004 --> 06:14.168
- Is that what you want?

06:14.168 --> 06:18.085
- You know, I just wanted
to give him a chance.

06:21.003 --> 06:23.451
- We should've gone when we could.

06:23.451 --> 06:24.451
- I'm sorry.

06:33.425 --> 06:36.425
You know, I don't think I can drive.

06:39.114 --> 06:39.947
- I can.

06:42.426 --> 06:45.843
(car door creaking open)

06:50.578 --> 06:52.908
(keys jingling)

06:52.908 --> 06:55.658
- So, remember what I taught you?

06:57.051 --> 06:57.884
Mirror.

07:01.637 --> 07:03.220
Foot on the clutch.

07:05.338 --> 07:06.171
Gently.

07:07.896 --> 07:09.896
Look over your shoulder.

07:12.637 --> 07:13.470
Good girl.

07:16.446 --> 07:19.113
(ominous music)

07:57.925 --> 08:00.842
(car horn blaring)

08:12.912 --> 08:13.829
What is it?

08:14.699 --> 08:15.565
- It's okay.

08:15.565 --> 08:17.815
I'm only gonna be a minute.

08:22.243 --> 08:24.743
(car beeping)

08:27.533 --> 08:30.366
(urine splashing)

08:39.852 --> 08:43.102
(wind chime twinkling)

09:07.698 --> 09:09.545
(car door slamming)

09:09.545 --> 09:12.295
(engine revving)

09:14.080 --> 09:16.580
(light music)

09:31.864 --> 09:34.281
(dark music)

09:50.340 --> 09:52.423
- Hey, don't go to sleep.

10:07.414 --> 10:08.526
- What's wrong?

10:08.526 --> 10:09.638
Mom?

10:09.638 --> 10:12.078
- (stammering) I thought
there was someone there.

10:12.078 --> 10:12.911
- Who?

10:18.235 --> 10:20.426
- No!
(brakes squealing)

10:20.426 --> 10:22.676
(crashing)

10:24.897 --> 10:28.314
(car door creaking open)

10:29.904 --> 10:32.571
(heavy panting)

10:39.835 --> 10:44.835
(car door creaking open)
(car beeping)

10:52.980 --> 10:54.897
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

10:58.103 --> 10:59.103
- I crashed.

11:01.892 --> 11:04.088
- You had to stop.

11:04.088 --> 11:05.588
You had no choice.

11:08.953 --> 11:10.613
- I don't know what we're going to do.

11:12.140 --> 11:13.223
- Don't know.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.340
Well, we can't just stay here.

11:21.190 --> 11:24.037
(sniffling)

11:24.037 --> 11:25.809
- Okay.

11:25.809 --> 11:28.892
(footsteps thudding)

11:43.685 --> 11:47.233
(car door creaking open)
(car beeping)

11:47.233 --> 11:50.650
(car door creaking shut)

11:57.230 --> 12:00.397
(footsteps puttering)

12:11.146 --> 12:14.396
(wind chime twinkling)

12:52.240 --> 12:55.157
(glass shattering)

13:01.410 --> 13:02.243
- Hello?

13:03.110 --> 13:04.210
Is there anybody here?

13:10.150 --> 13:10.983
Hello?

14:14.200 --> 14:16.950
(fire crackling)

14:21.390 --> 14:22.830
- You're like Goldilocks.

14:28.062 --> 14:30.562
(eerie music)

14:44.313 --> 14:47.396
(seagulls squawking)

15:32.100 --> 15:32.933
- Mom?

15:35.208 --> 15:36.041
Mom?

15:38.361 --> 15:41.444
(footsteps thudding)

15:49.154 --> 15:49.987
- There you are.

15:49.987 --> 15:52.300
- [Daughter] I woke up
and you weren't there.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.603
- I had to barf.

15:58.070 --> 15:59.303
You slept for hours.

16:01.256 --> 16:02.870
You must've been really tired.

16:02.870 --> 16:04.440
- I'm okay.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.020
- I slept really well, too.

16:06.020 --> 16:07.013
Really well.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.573
Like I used to at Grandma's.

16:10.757 --> 16:14.010
That room at the top of the house.

16:14.010 --> 16:16.160
We used to stay there
when you were a baby.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.117
You probably don't remember.

16:19.117 --> 16:20.655
- I do.

16:20.655 --> 16:22.790
- Do you?
- Mhmm.

16:22.790 --> 16:25.215
- The seagull used to knock
on the window in the morning.

16:25.215 --> 16:27.504
- (chuckling) Yeah, I remember.

16:27.504 --> 16:29.310
- [Mom] You probably just
remember me telling it.

16:29.310 --> 16:30.160
- No, I remember.

16:32.550 --> 16:33.800
- [Mom] Of course you do.

16:42.980 --> 16:44.340
- What's wrong?

16:44.340 --> 16:45.173
- Nothing.

16:47.350 --> 16:48.373
I feel strange.

16:50.273 --> 16:52.323
Not used to feeling like this.

16:54.134 --> 16:55.350
- Are you in pain?

16:55.350 --> 16:56.313
- No, I'm okay.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.877
Honestly, it's just--

17:00.100 --> 17:04.261
It was such a shock, what
happened with your brother.

17:04.261 --> 17:05.761
I'm just feeling really tired.

17:06.920 --> 17:07.920
I just need to rest.

17:14.648 --> 17:17.039
- I'll hang the clothes up for you, okay?

17:17.039 --> 17:17.872
- Okay.

17:19.779 --> 17:21.880
I don't like crumples.

17:21.880 --> 17:25.363
- I know.
(lightly chuckling)

17:34.321 --> 17:36.488
(sighing)

17:51.468 --> 17:54.385
(plastic rustling)

18:45.756 --> 18:48.098
(birds chirping)

18:48.098 --> 18:51.181
(footsteps thudding)

19:10.912 --> 19:15.079
(car door creaking open and shut)

19:17.216 --> 19:20.216
(engine sputtering)

19:38.132 --> 19:41.299
(light ominous music)

20:16.319 --> 20:19.402
(seagulls squawking)

20:23.842 --> 20:27.425
(curious orchestral music)

21:15.763 --> 21:18.513
(sheep bleating)

21:22.724 --> 21:25.474
(birds chirping)

22:10.868 --> 22:14.035
(spoon scraping bowl)

22:18.252 --> 22:20.085
What are you thinking?

22:21.947 --> 22:24.023
- I'm thinking about when he was a baby.

22:26.140 --> 22:27.740
And he had been crying one night

22:29.830 --> 22:31.790
and I picked him up and I held
him in front of the mirror

22:31.790 --> 22:34.883
and I told him he was ugly
and I wished I never had him.

22:36.900 --> 22:39.750
And of course he couldn't
understand, he was just a baby.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.873
I was so stupid and young.

22:48.930 --> 22:51.110
But sometimes I wonder
if he did understand

22:53.120 --> 22:54.693
and that's why he hates me.

22:56.730 --> 22:58.449
Your brother.
- Yeah, I know who

22:58.449 --> 22:59.499
you're talking about.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.830
Why do you always say your brother

23:01.830 --> 23:03.530
like he belongs to me and not you?

23:04.680 --> 23:06.490
- I'm sorry.
- He's your son

23:06.490 --> 23:07.400
and he did this to you.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.993
He's got nothing to do with me.

23:11.870 --> 23:14.070
- I've made a mess of
everything, haven't I?

23:18.796 --> 23:21.796
- Well you didn't make a mess of me.

23:23.260 --> 23:24.093
- I didn't.

23:25.270 --> 23:26.103
You're right.

23:29.070 --> 23:30.470
I didn't make a mess of you.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.313
Maybe you should call your father.

23:40.313 --> 23:41.146
- Why?

23:42.462 --> 23:43.562
- Why won't this work?

23:49.623 --> 23:52.290
(water running)

23:53.420 --> 23:55.160
Just in case.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.740
- We don't need him.

23:56.740 --> 23:59.080
You said everything was going to be fine.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.000
- And it is.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.090
But just in case.

24:02.090 --> 24:04.025
You've got his number, haven't you?

24:04.025 --> 24:05.692
- Yeah, I've got it.

24:10.227 --> 24:11.340
- You know, it's funny 'cause

24:12.610 --> 24:15.110
I was so worried about
what he was going to do and

24:17.340 --> 24:18.173
that's done.

24:19.420 --> 24:20.333
We got away.

24:23.810 --> 24:26.670
Hey, do you know where I've
always really wanted to go?

24:26.670 --> 24:29.920
One of those islands really far up north.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.783
You know, those places that
you have to get there by boat.

24:33.910 --> 24:35.583
And I could stop driving my taxi.

24:36.810 --> 24:41.250
I could make a wild island garden

24:41.250 --> 24:44.493
with sea holly and dogwood.

24:48.165 --> 24:48.998
I'd like that.

24:50.331 --> 24:51.670
- And what about me?

24:51.670 --> 24:52.503
What would I do?

24:54.500 --> 24:55.403
- You'd swim.

24:56.362 --> 24:57.610
(giggling)

24:57.610 --> 25:00.920
From island to island all day, you'd swim.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.341
You'd be the champion island swimmer.

25:03.341 --> 25:04.530
(chuckling)

25:04.530 --> 25:05.980
My champion girl.

25:49.218 --> 25:52.635
(light orchestral music)

27:33.284 --> 27:34.117
- Hey.

27:35.664 --> 27:36.497
Hey!

27:40.709 --> 27:42.292
What are you doing?

27:43.186 --> 27:44.563
- What do you mean, what am I doing?

27:45.920 --> 27:46.870
What are you doing?

27:48.600 --> 27:51.293
- Nothing, I was just thinking
about swimming in the lake.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.253
- Like that?

27:54.664 --> 27:59.664
- Well, I brought swimming stuff.

28:02.623 --> 28:05.326
Why were you on the wall?

28:05.326 --> 28:07.031
- I was just practicing.

28:07.031 --> 28:08.531
- Practicing what?

28:11.313 --> 28:12.163
- The stuff I do.

28:13.350 --> 28:14.207
What's it to you?

28:16.623 --> 28:17.783
- I thought you were going to jump.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.950
- I did jump.

28:19.950 --> 28:21.333
- I mean jump off.

28:23.090 --> 28:24.190
- Why would I do that?

28:25.840 --> 28:27.090
- I don't know.

28:31.470 --> 28:33.677
So do you live around here?

28:33.677 --> 28:34.846
- Yeah.

28:34.846 --> 28:36.240
Do me a favor.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.540
- Well are you on holiday?

28:38.412 --> 28:39.400
(chuckling)

28:39.400 --> 28:40.743
- No, I'm not on holiday.

28:41.970 --> 28:42.803
Are you?

28:43.950 --> 28:45.350
- I'm just here with my mom.

28:46.500 --> 28:49.763
She's not well so we're
stopping here for a bit.

28:52.183 --> 28:54.850
(bird chirping)

29:02.570 --> 29:04.620
- It would kill you if you swam in there.

29:06.900 --> 29:07.733
Don't do it.

29:10.124 --> 29:11.480
- I'm a good swimmer.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.073
- Swimming in a nuclear
lake, that's not so clever.

29:16.410 --> 29:19.160
- What do you mean, nuclear?
- From the power station.

29:20.150 --> 29:21.920
They closed it down.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.570
Still full of toxic shit, though.

29:24.510 --> 29:25.343
The lake, too.

29:29.920 --> 29:30.753
Anyway.

29:31.770 --> 29:32.630
If you want to go swimming,

29:32.630 --> 29:34.230
there's better places than this.

29:35.530 --> 29:36.380
I could show you.

29:39.005 --> 29:39.838
- Yeah?

29:42.808 --> 29:46.225
(light orchestral music)

30:06.185 --> 30:08.852
(water gushing)

30:36.613 --> 30:38.863
(shouting)

30:40.122 --> 30:42.955
(water splashing)

30:44.036 --> 30:46.286
(shouting)

30:48.180 --> 30:49.063
- It's great!

30:49.063 --> 30:51.140
I can't feel my feet anymore.

30:55.358 --> 30:56.608
But it's great!

30:59.122 --> 31:02.141
(water splashing)

31:02.141 --> 31:04.641
(light music)

31:40.026 --> 31:41.029
You okay?

31:41.029 --> 31:44.370
You're not going into
shock or anything, are you?

31:44.370 --> 31:45.203
- No, I'm okay.

31:48.770 --> 31:49.973
- Goosebumps.

31:51.322 --> 31:54.322
(shallow breathing)

32:30.830 --> 32:32.997
- Make sure you stay on your side.

32:36.883 --> 32:37.993
- Well I always do.

32:39.113 --> 32:40.778
Except when you kick me.

32:40.778 --> 32:41.611
(laughing)

32:41.611 --> 32:45.688
- At least I don't shout out
in the night like a lunatic.

32:45.688 --> 32:47.790
- I don't do that anymore.

32:47.790 --> 32:48.623
- Yeah?

32:49.925 --> 32:50.758
You did.

32:51.721 --> 32:53.617
Last time we were at the caravan.

32:53.617 --> 32:55.034
- What did I say?

32:56.128 --> 32:57.585
(giggling)

32:57.585 --> 32:58.841
What?

32:58.841 --> 33:03.012
- You said-- (laughing)

33:03.012 --> 33:04.508
Don't wet the bed, Florence!

33:04.508 --> 33:05.984
(laughing)

33:05.984 --> 33:08.103
- Why'd I call you Florence?

33:08.103 --> 33:12.199
- Why did you think I
was gonna wet the bed?

33:12.199 --> 33:14.449
(giggling)

33:16.334 --> 33:18.667
- Maybe I had a premonition.

33:20.251 --> 33:23.985
- Maybe you're the one
that's gonna wet the bed.

33:23.985 --> 33:25.603
- No.

33:25.603 --> 33:27.270
It's definitely you.

33:34.538 --> 33:35.371
Mom?

34:03.108 --> 34:05.691
(wind blowing)

34:09.006 --> 34:11.673
(ominous music)

34:28.216 --> 34:31.383
(bird wings flapping)

35:46.752 --> 35:48.152
- Careful when you jump off.

35:50.225 --> 35:52.883
You expect to bounce, but
the ground feels really hard.

35:57.580 --> 35:59.780
- I had to go to gymnastics
when I was little,

35:59.780 --> 36:01.710
but I was no good at it.

36:01.710 --> 36:03.260
Couldn't even stand on one leg.

36:04.890 --> 36:07.593
I'm better at swimming and diving.

36:11.620 --> 36:12.570
Do you like diving?

36:14.280 --> 36:15.980
- I like going up, not going down.

36:17.220 --> 36:18.270
I like being up high.

36:20.544 --> 36:22.389
- What's the highest you've ever been?

36:22.389 --> 36:23.920
Well, apart from an airplane.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.033
- In China.
- Where in China?

36:27.880 --> 36:29.180
- Why do you want to know?

36:30.530 --> 36:31.630
- I'm just interested.

36:34.750 --> 36:36.420
- I could show you if you'd like.

36:39.852 --> 36:44.019
(car door creaking open and shut)

36:51.060 --> 36:53.760
We had to get there at
three in the morning.

36:53.760 --> 36:56.323
It took six hours just to get halfway up.

36:56.323 --> 36:58.656
(chuckling)

37:08.920 --> 37:10.670
We had to stop there.

37:10.670 --> 37:11.503
The police came.

37:12.710 --> 37:13.760
- Did they catch you?

37:15.010 --> 37:16.660
- I wouldn't be here if they did.

37:17.710 --> 37:18.543
We had to run!

37:22.100 --> 37:23.483
- So who's the other boy?

37:24.640 --> 37:25.473
- Antone.

37:26.660 --> 37:28.120
He's from the Ukraine.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.503
Now he's a crazy guy!

37:31.290 --> 37:32.290
I'm waiting for him.

37:33.270 --> 37:34.103
- [Emma] Why?

37:35.381 --> 37:37.228
- We're just going to hang out here.

37:37.228 --> 37:38.278
- Yeah, but why here?

37:39.400 --> 37:40.700
- Why do you want to know?

37:41.910 --> 37:44.293
- So you're going to climb things?

37:44.293 --> 37:45.503
- Just one thing.

37:47.037 --> 37:48.204
- [Emma] What?

37:50.040 --> 37:51.810
- [Boy] If I tell you,

37:51.810 --> 37:53.650
you have to swear you won't tell anyone.

37:53.650 --> 37:54.640
- Yeah, I swear.

37:54.640 --> 37:55.810
- [Boy] You won't go
running back to your mom

37:55.810 --> 37:57.260
and be like, guess what, Mom?

38:00.100 --> 38:01.500
- You don't have to tell me.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.210
- Me and Antone, we're going
to climb up to the roof

38:09.210 --> 38:10.803
of the nuclear power station.

38:12.151 --> 38:12.984
- What?

38:14.125 --> 38:14.958
- Yeah.

38:19.923 --> 38:22.240
So we were going to climb up the outside,

38:22.240 --> 38:24.230
but there's no way we
can get away with it.

38:24.230 --> 38:26.030
So we need to do it from the inside.

38:27.154 --> 38:28.293
But the last bit, though,

38:30.150 --> 38:31.650
I don't know.

38:31.650 --> 38:32.950
Maybe we can get out onto the roof,

38:32.950 --> 38:35.130
but maybe we need to get out
one of the windows up there

38:35.130 --> 38:37.520
and climb the last bit on the outside.

38:37.520 --> 38:38.353
- You could die.

38:39.530 --> 38:40.363
- Yeah.

38:41.410 --> 38:42.243
We could.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.090
- What's it like inside?

38:48.226 --> 38:49.434
- I don't know yet.

38:49.434 --> 38:50.760
I'm waiting for Antone.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.420
I wouldn't go in on my own.

38:52.420 --> 38:53.253
- Why not?

38:54.210 --> 38:55.860
- You don't know what's in there.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.210
You need at least two of you.

38:59.971 --> 39:01.387
- Well, I could come with you.

39:02.351 --> 39:03.750
(laughing)

39:03.750 --> 39:05.141
- No fucking way.

39:05.141 --> 39:05.974
- Why not?

39:37.288 --> 39:40.205
(dishes clamoring)

39:46.516 --> 39:47.683
- Is that you?

39:48.583 --> 39:51.500
(dishes clamoring)

40:00.834 --> 40:02.590
You don't have to clear up.

40:02.590 --> 40:04.340
I would've done that.

40:05.468 --> 40:08.218
(mystical music)

40:14.650 --> 40:17.317
(water running)

40:24.673 --> 40:25.506
You okay?

40:27.157 --> 40:27.990
Where have you been?

40:29.740 --> 40:31.580
- Nowhere, just getting ready for bed.

40:31.580 --> 40:33.150
- No, before that.

40:33.150 --> 40:35.070
You've been gone for days.

40:35.070 --> 40:36.183
- What?

40:36.183 --> 40:38.683
- I was worried about you,
so it seemed like days.

40:40.381 --> 40:41.231
- It wasn't long.

40:45.230 --> 40:46.280
- Did you see anyone?

40:47.227 --> 40:48.780
- Where?

40:48.780 --> 40:49.893
- Inside the house.

40:52.070 --> 40:52.903
Or outside.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.020
- I was just talking to a boy.

40:59.430 --> 41:00.830
- [Mom] Why's your hair wet?

41:01.800 --> 41:02.633
- It's not.

41:04.950 --> 41:05.900
- I thought it was.

41:06.933 --> 41:07.766
Why did I think that?

41:07.766 --> 41:09.050
Why did I think your hair was wet?

41:10.045 --> 41:10.878
- Probably just the light.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.063
- So who's this boy?

41:18.870 --> 41:19.703
- Just a boy.

41:21.870 --> 41:24.537
(water running)

41:27.380 --> 41:28.680
- I keep thinking that
something really bad

41:28.680 --> 41:29.630
is going to happen.

41:38.762 --> 41:41.490
(sniffling)

41:41.490 --> 41:43.203
- Something bad already happened.

41:44.520 --> 41:47.081
- Yes, I know.

41:47.081 --> 41:48.013
Something worse.

41:53.384 --> 41:56.801
(light orchestral music)

42:31.540 --> 42:33.160
- This place,

42:33.160 --> 42:37.362
it was used for weapons in the Cold War.

42:37.362 --> 42:39.357
And the Cold War made
not with the enemies.

42:39.357 --> 42:42.420
But now we're going nuclear together.

42:43.940 --> 42:45.359
Do you know where you come from?

42:45.359 --> 42:47.023
Atone, the Ukraine?

42:52.000 --> 42:53.890
They had Chernobyl there.

42:55.680 --> 42:57.463
The place is full of wolves now.

43:00.301 --> 43:02.501
- Maybe there's wolves inside here.

43:02.501 --> 43:03.668
- Yeah, maybe!

43:08.710 --> 43:11.776
So people say the fuel
pumps are still there,

43:11.776 --> 43:12.973
that they haven't emptied them yet.

43:14.307 --> 43:15.953
Locate the spinning fuel rods.

43:17.749 --> 43:20.681
You can swim in there.
- Could I?

43:20.681 --> 43:22.159
- No.

43:22.159 --> 43:23.380
Of course you couldn't swim in there.

43:23.380 --> 43:25.460
They've got fucking nuclear fuel in them.

43:25.460 --> 43:26.293
Jesus.

43:29.820 --> 43:31.373
I don't know if this is such a good idea.

43:37.420 --> 43:38.370
This is the way in.

43:39.759 --> 43:41.185
- You know, I make jokes
about swimming so much.

43:41.185 --> 43:43.602
I didn't even bring my towel.

43:53.247 --> 43:55.157
- So we just go in for a bit of a racket

43:55.157 --> 43:59.153
and go out quick, okay?
(liquid running)

44:20.245 --> 44:21.761
You okay?

44:21.761 --> 44:22.594
- Yeah.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.660
- So before they built the power station,

44:34.660 --> 44:36.410
this was used for chemical weapons.

44:37.690 --> 44:39.853
That's why there's all
this underground stuff.

44:41.269 --> 44:43.130
I'm going to take a look down here.

44:43.130 --> 44:44.123
You stay there!

44:45.696 --> 44:48.696
(shallow breathing)

44:53.910 --> 44:56.577
(ominous music)

45:20.510 --> 45:21.343
- Hey, Sis.

45:22.559 --> 45:23.392
Found ya.

45:27.236 --> 45:29.398
- [Emma] Go away.

45:29.398 --> 45:30.231
Go away!

45:31.485 --> 45:32.318
Go away!

45:34.870 --> 45:35.703
- It's okay.

45:35.703 --> 45:36.671
Here.

45:36.671 --> 45:38.336
I'm here.

45:38.336 --> 45:39.650
(muttering)

45:39.650 --> 45:40.693
What are you talking about?

45:40.693 --> 45:42.197
- Someone's here.

45:42.197 --> 45:44.614
- There can't be anyone here.

45:45.810 --> 45:47.080
It's our own voices, see?

45:49.971 --> 45:52.138
(howling)

46:05.883 --> 46:09.300
(light orchestral music)

46:51.711 --> 46:52.544
Go on.

46:53.948 --> 46:55.633
It won't hurt.

46:55.633 --> 46:57.023
- I don't like drugs.

46:58.750 --> 46:59.650
- Drugs are great.

47:09.407 --> 47:11.074
It's okay, you know.

47:12.740 --> 47:14.390
I shouldn't have taken you there.

47:16.250 --> 47:17.153
- Just scared me.

47:18.690 --> 47:19.660
- Yeah.

47:19.660 --> 47:20.493
Well.

47:22.100 --> 47:24.024
It was fucking scary, wasn't it?

47:24.024 --> 47:26.357
(chuckling)

47:41.220 --> 47:42.863
How old are you anyway?

47:45.190 --> 47:46.023
- 14.

47:47.276 --> 47:49.513
- (scoffs) Shit!

47:52.480 --> 47:53.730
- What's wrong with that?

47:58.039 --> 48:01.560
- Does your mother know where you are?

48:01.560 --> 48:02.410
- She won't mind.

48:06.000 --> 48:06.950
- Where's your dad?

48:07.800 --> 48:08.633
- Romania.

48:22.080 --> 48:23.330
How many tattoos you got?

48:24.830 --> 48:25.663
- A few.

48:26.580 --> 48:27.630
- Yeah, but how many?

48:30.210 --> 48:32.583
- I get a new one when I
do a really good climb.

48:35.090 --> 48:36.413
- Will you give me a tattoo?

48:37.889 --> 48:40.730
- (chuckling) No.

48:40.730 --> 48:42.230
I'd draw on you if you'd like.

48:43.582 --> 48:44.810
- I'm not a kid.

48:44.810 --> 48:46.793
- [Boy] No, you're 14.

48:50.840 --> 48:52.243
- Will you pierce my ear then?

48:53.710 --> 48:54.543
All yours.

48:57.408 --> 48:58.408
- All right.

49:07.990 --> 49:09.727
You don't even like smoke, do you?

49:11.702 --> 49:13.302
- No, it smells like my brother.

49:14.750 --> 49:16.263
- What's wrong with your brother?

49:17.130 --> 49:17.963
- Everything.

49:21.703 --> 49:22.692
(chuckling)

49:22.692 --> 49:25.350
- This is going to hurt like fuck.

49:25.350 --> 49:27.500
You're supposed to put ice on it first.

49:27.500 --> 49:28.900
- I don't care.

49:28.900 --> 49:31.700
- Which bit do you want, the
top bit or the bottom bit?

49:31.700 --> 49:32.533
- Top.

49:34.180 --> 49:35.990
- All right, I'm going to count to three.

49:35.990 --> 49:37.550
Ready?
- Yup.

49:37.550 --> 49:39.277
- One, two--

49:40.333 --> 49:41.550
(chuckling)

49:41.550 --> 49:43.859
Don't fiddle with it, just leave it.

49:43.859 --> 49:44.692
There.

50:09.477 --> 50:11.977
(eerie music)

50:28.366 --> 50:33.366
(birds chirping)
(eerie music)

50:58.283 --> 51:00.620
- [Woman] This place is not for you.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.103
- [Boy] So you going to
tell me about your brother?

51:26.700 --> 51:28.100
- He's only my half brother.

51:29.640 --> 51:31.573
He went to prison because
of what he did to me.

51:34.240 --> 51:35.440
- What did he do to you?

51:37.625 --> 51:39.910
- Oh, it was nothing like that.

51:39.910 --> 51:41.010
He fractured my skull.

51:42.760 --> 51:44.250
- He what?

51:44.250 --> 51:46.700
- Threw me against a wall
and fractured my skull.

51:48.040 --> 51:50.975
I was only eight, it was
easy for him to pick me up.

51:50.975 --> 51:51.808
- Fuck.

51:53.520 --> 51:54.353
You were eight?

51:57.320 --> 51:58.710
So what happened?

51:58.710 --> 52:01.513
- My mom came home, called an ambulance

52:02.790 --> 52:04.340
and then she called the police.

52:05.626 --> 52:07.226
- (stammering) Why did he do it?

52:08.830 --> 52:09.663
- He hated me.

52:14.670 --> 52:16.873
We can go in again if you want.

52:16.873 --> 52:18.228
I won't be scared next time

52:18.228 --> 52:19.573
because I'll know what to expect.

52:21.820 --> 52:22.653
- Okay.

52:24.996 --> 52:26.483
- You know, when I first saw you,

52:27.690 --> 52:28.943
I thought you were a ghost.

52:31.581 --> 52:34.490
(chuckling)

52:34.490 --> 52:35.733
- [Boy] I'm not a ghost.

52:38.210 --> 52:39.907
- No, I know you're not.

53:15.730 --> 53:16.563
Mom?

53:19.130 --> 53:20.563
- I told you not to go out.

53:22.290 --> 53:23.930
(stammering) I told you it
was too dangerous out there.

53:23.930 --> 53:25.390
- What, no you didn't.

53:25.390 --> 53:26.223
- Yes I did.

53:26.223 --> 53:27.056
I told you.

53:27.056 --> 53:29.413
I said, don't go out
there because there's--

53:30.443 --> 53:31.893
There's too much to harm you.

53:33.440 --> 53:35.070
But you had to go off

53:35.070 --> 53:37.563
'cause you think you're so big now.

53:39.404 --> 53:42.093
But you're just, you're still a child.

53:43.580 --> 53:46.360
- Why are you packing?
- Because we're leaving.

53:46.360 --> 53:47.193
- How?

53:47.193 --> 53:48.026
The car's broken down.

53:48.026 --> 53:49.400
We haven't got any money.

53:49.400 --> 53:51.180
- I can't stay here.

53:51.180 --> 53:52.923
- But I want to, I like it here.

53:53.970 --> 53:55.120
- You don't understand.

53:58.690 --> 53:59.523
What's this?

54:02.080 --> 54:03.360
When did this happen?

54:03.360 --> 54:04.850
- It's nothing.

54:04.850 --> 54:05.793
- No, it's not.

54:07.170 --> 54:09.270
It's not nothing.
- It's just an earring.

54:10.110 --> 54:12.303
- Who did this to you?
- No one.

54:14.530 --> 54:15.580
- Well do you think I'm an idiot?

54:15.580 --> 54:17.660
Of course it's not no one.

54:17.660 --> 54:19.330
Was it this boy you've been talking to?

54:19.330 --> 54:21.430
- Why do you have to be
so dramatic about it?

54:21.430 --> 54:22.510
- I'm not being dramatic,

54:22.510 --> 54:23.960
I'm trying to be your mother.

54:26.720 --> 54:29.060
Look, we're in this terrible place and--

54:29.060 --> 54:30.610
- Yeah, and whose fault's that?

54:31.910 --> 54:33.930
We wouldn't be here if it weren't for you!

54:33.930 --> 54:34.990
We could've got away.

54:34.990 --> 54:36.380
We could've gone to Romania.

54:36.380 --> 54:37.213
Anywhere!

54:38.410 --> 54:39.878
But no, you had to wait for him

54:39.878 --> 54:42.333
'cause you're so desperate
for him to love you.

54:43.490 --> 54:44.640
And look what happened.

54:47.840 --> 54:48.673
Well done.

54:50.420 --> 54:51.760
- No please, don't go.

54:51.760 --> 54:53.503
Don't, don't turn your back on me!

54:59.219 --> 55:01.386
(sighing)

55:03.793 --> 55:06.460
(water running)

55:46.873 --> 55:49.873
(dial tone ringing)

55:52.100 --> 55:53.639
- Bona.
- Dad, it's me.

55:53.639 --> 55:54.472
- [Dad] We're not here right now.

55:54.472 --> 55:57.320
Please leave a message.
(beeping)

55:57.320 --> 55:58.477
- It doesn't matter.

56:51.988 --> 56:56.988
(faint ominous music)
(wind chime twinkling)

57:18.206 --> 57:20.873
(phone ringing)

57:32.845 --> 57:34.512
Hello?
- Is that you?

57:36.240 --> 57:37.073
Emma.

57:38.460 --> 57:39.293
- Dad?

57:40.160 --> 57:41.723
- [Dad] So glad to hear your voice.

57:43.350 --> 57:45.120
- How'd you get this number?

57:45.120 --> 57:47.443
- [Dad] Well, you called
me last night, remember?

57:48.356 --> 57:51.760
- Yeah.
- So where are you?

57:51.760 --> 57:52.741
I found a number.

57:52.741 --> 57:54.756
I found where you are, somewhere north?

57:54.756 --> 57:58.020
- Well, that's not my reason I called you.

57:58.020 --> 57:59.720
I just want to tell you about Mom.

58:01.510 --> 58:02.800
I think she's okay.

58:02.800 --> 58:05.890
I mean, she's not okay because
my brother really hurt her.

58:05.890 --> 58:07.153
She was getting better.

58:08.860 --> 58:10.793
Now it seems like she's getting worse.

58:12.010 --> 58:13.150
I don't know, maybe it's the shock

58:13.150 --> 58:14.550
that's making her act funny.

58:16.213 --> 58:17.781
I really want her to see
a doctor, but we can't.

58:17.781 --> 58:21.100
We've got to keep away from
people in case he finds us,

58:21.100 --> 58:22.563
in case my brother finds us.

58:25.930 --> 58:28.810
Dad, are you still there?
- I don't understand

58:28.810 --> 58:30.729
what you're saying.

58:30.729 --> 58:31.810
You're not making any sense.

58:31.810 --> 58:35.210
- I'm saying Mom seems to be
getting worse and I'm worried.

58:35.210 --> 58:36.817
That's why I called you.

58:38.103 --> 58:40.260
- [Dad] What do you mean
she's getting worse?

58:40.260 --> 58:42.360
- Well, she's better physically, stronger.

58:45.830 --> 58:49.063
She's being strange, like
something's happened to her head.

58:50.580 --> 58:51.680
- [Dad] Where are you?

58:52.611 --> 58:53.444
- In a house.

58:53.444 --> 58:55.680
It's like a holy place
for religious people.

58:55.680 --> 58:57.520
- [Dad] Then who else is with you?

58:57.520 --> 58:59.703
- No one, just Mom and me.

59:02.544 --> 59:03.377
Dad?

59:05.410 --> 59:07.950
- [Dad] Emma, the police
called me here in Romania.

59:07.950 --> 59:10.380
They called me to tell me what happened.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.336
- Well how do the police know?

59:12.336 --> 59:13.980
Have they got my brother?

59:13.980 --> 59:16.460
- [Dad] They found your mom, Emma.

59:16.460 --> 59:17.293
In the woods.

59:17.293 --> 59:19.280
They found a body and
they couldn't find you,

59:19.280 --> 59:20.700
so they called me and--

59:21.595 --> 59:22.793
Well, I didn't know what to do.

59:25.875 --> 59:27.292
- But she's here.

59:28.270 --> 59:29.523
- [Dad] She's in the morgue.

59:35.772 --> 59:36.605
- What?

59:39.775 --> 59:43.190
- [Dad] I'm sorry.

59:43.190 --> 59:44.023
Emma, tell me where you are.

59:44.023 --> 59:45.240
I could maybe get a flight.

59:45.240 --> 59:47.760
I mean, it's going to be
difficult with the girls, but--

59:47.760 --> 59:49.667
If you need me to come over, I could--

1:00:07.139 --> 1:00:10.139
(shallow breathing)

1:00:50.564 --> 1:00:52.731
(sobbing)

1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:57.557
- (shrieking) Mom!

1:00:58.630 --> 1:01:01.297
(water running)

1:01:13.142 --> 1:01:15.809
(phone ringing)

1:01:23.066 --> 1:01:25.733
(phone ringing)

1:01:30.316 --> 1:01:33.733
(light orchestral music)

1:02:33.611 --> 1:02:36.858
(ominous music)

1:02:36.858 --> 1:02:39.358
(dog barking)

1:02:40.345 --> 1:02:42.762
(dark music)

1:03:59.766 --> 1:04:02.599
(glass clamoring)

1:04:06.364 --> 1:04:08.614
(rattling)

1:04:11.775 --> 1:04:14.525
(water dripping)

1:04:27.300 --> 1:04:30.383
(door creaking open)

1:04:32.548 --> 1:04:35.215
(ominous music)

1:05:01.497 --> 1:05:06.497
(shallow breathing)
(footsteps thudding)

1:06:03.008 --> 1:06:08.008
- Found ya.
(chuckling)

1:06:25.560 --> 1:06:28.477
(dishes clamoring)

1:06:55.164 --> 1:06:58.120
So what are you doing here, Sis?

1:06:58.120 --> 1:06:58.953
Hmm?

1:07:00.310 --> 1:07:01.643
All on your own.

1:07:04.078 --> 1:07:06.825
I was worried about you, you know?

1:07:06.825 --> 1:07:09.158
(sniffling)

1:07:22.419 --> 1:07:24.336
Do you want some spice?

1:07:25.874 --> 1:07:28.935
(chuckling)

1:07:28.935 --> 1:07:31.268
Of course you fucking don't.

1:07:32.513 --> 1:07:35.003
I got a taste for this when I was inside.

1:07:37.310 --> 1:07:39.733
Where was I inside again, Sis, hmm?

1:07:41.410 --> 1:07:42.883
Who was it that put me there?

1:07:45.090 --> 1:07:45.923
Oh yeah.

1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:48.620
It was our fucking mother.

1:07:57.914 --> 1:08:00.247
(crackling)

1:08:11.650 --> 1:08:12.750
I've been missing you.

1:08:14.890 --> 1:08:15.723
I was.

1:08:19.262 --> 1:08:21.929
(shouting) Hey!

1:08:24.807 --> 1:08:27.890
You're just lucky you're found, yeah?

1:08:30.779 --> 1:08:32.946
Why did you run away, hmm?

1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:42.430
I was following you.

1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:45.273
And then I lost you.

1:08:46.515 --> 1:08:50.098
And I thought, I actually
fucking lost her.

1:08:54.550 --> 1:08:56.100
Did she teach you how to drive?

1:09:01.330 --> 1:09:02.330
She never taught me.

1:09:07.540 --> 1:09:10.230
So I'm driving around for a few days,

1:09:10.230 --> 1:09:11.980
keeping my head down, you know why.

1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:15.040
And I pull into this lay by

1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:17.900
And you know what,

1:09:18.777 --> 1:09:21.823
it's like I could fucking
smell you in there.

1:09:25.797 --> 1:09:28.714
I knew you were somewhere close by.

1:09:32.424 --> 1:09:34.091
You listening to me?

1:09:38.108 --> 1:09:41.275
Fate is what brought us back together.

1:09:46.281 --> 1:09:49.031
And what do you think about that?

1:09:52.064 --> 1:09:55.499
Fuck.

1:09:55.499 --> 1:09:56.332
Stay here.

1:10:29.390 --> 1:10:31.340
What the fuck have you been
telling people about me?

1:10:31.340 --> 1:10:32.173
- I didn't say anything.

1:10:32.173 --> 1:10:33.931
- You're saying I killed your mom.

1:10:33.931 --> 1:10:34.960
- No.

1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:37.386
- Is that what you said?
- No.

1:10:37.386 --> 1:10:40.219
(heavy breathing)

1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:05.133
- You spiteful fucking bitch.

1:11:06.300 --> 1:11:08.790
You are just like your
fucking mother, you are.

1:11:08.790 --> 1:11:10.190
Always putting the blame on me.

1:11:10.190 --> 1:11:13.200
And then you left me in the fucking woods.

1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:15.732
But it don't fucking matter
what you do, does it?

1:11:15.732 --> 1:11:17.638
No, it's always my fault.

1:11:17.638 --> 1:11:21.046
(screaming)
My whole fucking life!

1:11:21.046 --> 1:11:23.963
(knocking on door)

1:11:25.375 --> 1:11:29.958
(whispering) You say one fucking word.

1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:13.710
Not your lucky night.

1:12:14.948 --> 1:12:19.615
(chuckling)
(urinating)

1:12:33.521 --> 1:12:35.104
What the fuck, Sis?

1:12:42.093 --> 1:12:44.393
You push me to the edge.

1:12:44.393 --> 1:12:46.445
You and your fucking mama.

1:12:46.445 --> 1:12:48.195
- Don't say her name.

1:12:49.905 --> 1:12:50.738
- You are.

1:12:55.520 --> 1:12:56.437
Don't move.

1:13:03.113 --> 1:13:05.280
(sobbing)

1:13:24.975 --> 1:13:27.308
(splashing)

1:13:36.928 --> 1:13:39.345
(dark music)

1:13:49.634 --> 1:13:50.467
- Don't.

1:13:56.647 --> 1:13:59.210
(laughing maniacally)

1:13:59.210 --> 1:14:01.268
- You thought you was on fire, didn't you?

1:14:01.268 --> 1:14:02.710
(laughing)

1:14:02.710 --> 1:14:04.149
It's only water.

1:14:04.149 --> 1:14:05.649
You fucking idiot.

1:14:08.499 --> 1:14:13.499
I am the fire!
(laughing)

1:14:15.437 --> 1:14:17.413
Be better next time, eh?

1:14:23.007 --> 1:14:25.340
(chuckling)

1:15:13.373 --> 1:15:16.123
(birds chirping)

1:16:18.646 --> 1:16:21.729
(footsteps pounding)

1:16:23.478 --> 1:16:26.311
(heavy breathing)

1:16:31.796 --> 1:16:34.213
(dark music)

1:16:56.661 --> 1:16:59.617
- [Emma] Wake up!
(pounding)

1:16:59.617 --> 1:17:02.673
- [Brother] You come back here!

1:17:02.673 --> 1:17:06.006
(dark orchestral music)

1:17:46.070 --> 1:17:46.903
Hey, Sis!

1:17:47.988 --> 1:17:52.642
(shouting drowned out by echo)

1:17:52.642 --> 1:17:54.007
(laughing)

1:17:54.007 --> 1:17:56.090
Who's your favorite girl?

1:18:45.591 --> 1:18:48.424
(water splashing)

1:18:54.664 --> 1:18:56.831
No more running away, Sis.

1:18:59.234 --> 1:19:00.950
(heavy breathing)

1:19:00.950 --> 1:19:03.480
We've got to stick together, me and you

1:19:05.180 --> 1:19:07.493
'cause blood sticks together.

1:19:09.822 --> 1:19:11.905
We're brother and sister.

1:19:30.590 --> 1:19:35.590
(grunting)
(water splashing)

1:19:50.064 --> 1:19:51.147
Please, Emma!

1:19:52.045 --> 1:19:52.878
Please!

1:20:13.901 --> 1:20:17.318
(light orchestral music)

1:21:16.171 --> 1:21:18.588
(sputtering)

1:21:31.399 --> 1:21:32.899
You saved me, Sis.

1:21:35.473 --> 1:21:37.890
I can't believe you saved me.

1:21:46.935 --> 1:21:49.363
But why'd you leave me there?

1:21:49.363 --> 1:21:52.113
In the woods, bleeding like that?

1:21:55.868 --> 1:21:58.118
(grunting)

1:22:01.821 --> 1:22:06.821
(wind chime twinkling)
(light orchestral music)

1:22:24.730 --> 1:22:26.103
You hurt me so much.

1:22:36.752 --> 1:22:38.252
It had to be done.

1:22:42.471 --> 1:22:45.304
(water splashing)

1:23:08.054 --> 1:23:09.479
- Emma!

1:23:09.479 --> 1:23:10.312
Emma?

1:23:15.289 --> 1:23:16.122
Emma!

1:23:19.077 --> 1:23:19.910
Emma.

1:23:21.014 --> 1:23:21.953
Emma!

1:23:21.953 --> 1:23:24.620
Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma.

1:23:24.620 --> 1:23:25.453
Hey, hey.

1:23:25.453 --> 1:23:26.350
Hey, it's me.

1:23:26.350 --> 1:23:30.937
It's me.
(sobbing)

1:23:30.937 --> 1:23:32.270
Why are you wet?

1:23:55.065 --> 1:23:57.898
(water splashing)

1:24:10.618 --> 1:24:14.035
(light orchestral music)

1:24:39.919 --> 1:24:42.669
(birds chirping)

1:24:53.311 --> 1:24:56.228
- It's a big tower of darkness came

1:24:57.377 --> 1:25:00.933
and it took away my home and my family.

1:25:03.460 --> 1:25:06.080
It was so quick that I had no time

1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:07.933
to understand what was happening.

1:25:10.970 --> 1:25:15.970
So I stayed in that place,
Fukushima, for a long time.

1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:23.313
I looked for my family,
but I couldn't find them.

1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:31.150
And I went in taxis like your taxi

1:25:33.020 --> 1:25:36.890
looking for my family,
looking for my home.

1:25:40.250 --> 1:25:41.433
But it was all gone.

1:25:47.053 --> 1:25:49.833
And now, you are ready.

1:25:52.060 --> 1:25:54.743
I can bring you to the next place.

1:25:56.090 --> 1:25:57.413
- But I need to go back now.

1:25:59.170 --> 1:26:00.690
- Go back?

1:26:00.690 --> 1:26:01.940
- Go back to my daughter.

1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:03.953
She's only 14.

1:26:07.014 --> 1:26:09.261
- No.

1:26:09.261 --> 1:26:10.761
No going back now.

1:26:14.703 --> 1:26:15.786
- Is this it?

1:27:01.234 --> 1:27:04.651
(car door creaking open)

1:27:05.715 --> 1:27:08.465
(engine revving)

1:27:13.388 --> 1:27:16.805
(light orchestral music)
