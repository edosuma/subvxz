and an army jacket.

in the Biblical sense.

07:00.883 --> 07:03.057
It's never too early
for a rebound fuck.

07:03.059 --> 07:04.275
That's like the whole point.

07:04.277 --> 07:07.278
Oh you would, wouldn't you?

07:07.280 --> 07:09.890
I'm far from ready for that.

07:09.892 --> 07:11.108
What do you got
to get ready for?

07:11.110 --> 07:13.894
You just lay down
and spread your legs.

07:13.896 --> 07:15.723
Emotionally ready.

07:16.942 --> 07:19.682
This just further
proves my theory.

07:19.684 --> 07:21.947
And which theory is that?

07:23.166 --> 07:25.862
That women can't
separate sex from emotion.

07:25.864 --> 07:27.908
Whereas men can.

07:27.910 --> 07:29.300
Why?

07:29.302 --> 07:30.998
Because of the primal
urge to spread their seed?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.783
Misogynistic bullshit.

07:33.785 --> 07:35.872
Hey, I'm not a
misogynist, okay?

07:35.874 --> 07:37.265
I love women.

07:37.267 --> 07:39.049
Okay, that's real rich.

Thank you.

07:40.923 --> 07:44.446
[loud drumming]

07:44.448 --> 07:45.795
[Rachel] So let me
get this straight.

07:45.797 --> 07:47.928
You can have sex with somebody,

07:47.930 --> 07:50.017
and never think
about them again?

07:50.019 --> 07:50.931
[Cameron] Correct.

07:50.933 --> 07:52.193
[Rachel] I don't understand.

07:52.195 --> 07:53.890
[Cameron] I don't
expect you to.

07:53.892 --> 07:55.500
You're a woman.

07:55.502 --> 07:56.719
[Rachel] I don't see what
that has to do with anything.

07:56.721 --> 07:59.113
[Cameron] It's just sex.

07:59.115 --> 08:00.201
Okay, pardon me, excuse me.

08:00.203 --> 08:02.856
I have, I have a question.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.815
Is that how you justify
having fucked a dude?

08:05.817 --> 08:06.729
Oh, come on.

08:06.731 --> 08:07.599
Wait, you fucked a dude?

08:07.601 --> 08:08.818
I did not fuck a dude.

08:08.820 --> 08:10.689
Oh, that's right,
he fucked you.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.952
Wait, so he fucked
you or did you...

08:11.954 --> 08:12.996
[Cameron] He did not fuck me.

08:12.998 --> 08:14.868
Just tell her the story.

08:14.870 --> 08:15.956
Okay.

08:15.958 --> 08:16.739
Fine.

08:16.741 --> 08:17.522
Yes.

08:17.524 --> 08:18.654
[faint clapping]

08:18.656 --> 08:19.526
Story time.

08:20.832 --> 08:23.485
So, we had this gig in
Chelsea and afterwards

08:23.487 --> 08:25.791
I'm hanging out at the bar
and this guy comes up to me

08:25.793 --> 08:27.968
and asks if I want to come
over and do some coke?

08:27.970 --> 08:29.099
So I told him "Yeah."

08:29.101 --> 08:30.448
Naturally.

08:30.450 --> 08:33.190
And he says to me
"Hey, I really like feet.

08:33.192 --> 08:34.409
"Is that okay with you?"

08:34.410 --> 08:35.714
Yes.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.542
So I was just like "Whatever."

08:37.544 --> 08:38.979
We're sitting on his
couch and after, you know,

08:38.981 --> 08:40.328
a few lines of coke,
he comes up to me

08:40.330 --> 08:42.982
and he removes my shoes.

08:42.985 --> 08:44.375
And I'm thinking, like,

08:44.377 --> 08:45.376
"Okay, he's going to give
me like a foot massage

08:45.378 --> 08:46.464
"or something like that."

08:46.466 --> 08:48.249
So then he pulls
down his pants...

08:48.251 --> 08:50.207
His dick rock hard!

08:50.209 --> 08:53.080
He takes my feet, presses
them together, spits on it,

08:53.082 --> 08:56.126
and proceeds to fuck the
hole in between my feet.

08:56.128 --> 08:56.953
No.

08:56.955 --> 08:57.867
It gets better.

08:57.869 --> 08:59.086
Just as he's about to finish,

08:59.088 --> 09:02.002
he looks me dead in
the eyes and he says.

09:02.004 --> 09:04.656
[Cameron And Nicole] "Did you
ever do this with your dad?"

09:04.658 --> 09:05.962
No!

09:05.964 --> 09:07.616
He fucking cums
all over my pant leg.

09:07.618 --> 09:08.619
Oh my God.

09:10.012 --> 09:13.230
So what's the moral
to this little story?

09:13.232 --> 09:15.450
That men can separate
sex from emotion.

09:15.452 --> 09:18.366
Hence the phrase
"It's just sex."

09:18.368 --> 09:22.109
I'm not sure that that
is the moral to that story.

09:22.111 --> 09:24.850
Yeah, it also
sounds pretty gay.

09:24.852 --> 09:26.026
True

09:26.028 --> 09:27.636
Yeah, well, you know,

09:27.638 --> 09:30.030
that's just a misconception of
gender roles in our society.

09:30.032 --> 09:32.075
Well I suppose you think
like when two girls hook up

09:32.077 --> 09:36.210
with one another they're
just having a little fun?

09:36.212 --> 09:37.298
Don't think I forgot

20:47.665 --> 20:50.710
He took an experience
we could all relate to,

20:50.712 --> 20:54.061
males of course, and expressed
it in a way that maintained

20:54.063 --> 20:57.760
the naivety of youth while
incorporating the complexities

20:57.762 --> 20:59.022
of adult thought processes.

20:59.024 --> 20:59.762
Hey.

20:59.764 --> 21:00.720
Hey.

21:00.722 --> 21:01.721
Oh my God, you were so great.

21:01.723 --> 21:02.765
[Trevor] Thanks.

21:02.767 --> 21:03.984
[Rachel] You
were really funny.

21:03.986 --> 21:04.724
[Trevor] Cool,
I'm glad you came.

21:04.726 --> 21:06.073
Thanks for coming.

21:06.075 --> 21:06.682
Hi, I'd like to
introduce myself.

21:06.684 --> 21:07.509
I'm Ernest.

21:07.511 --> 21:08.033
Oh, are you?

21:08.904 --> 21:09.905
Oh, he is.

21:11.863 --> 21:12.690
I am.

21:15.737 --> 21:17.432
Why don't we all get a drink.

21:17.434 --> 21:18.738
Yeah, yeah, I was going
to suggest that actually.

21:18.740 --> 21:19.739
I know the perfect place.

21:19.741 --> 21:20.870
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

21:20.872 --> 21:22.439
[Ernest] Grand.

21:26.051 --> 21:29.705
I mean that vulnerability,
that most people don't

21:29.707 --> 21:33.578
even delve into, and to
take that and to share it

21:33.580 --> 21:35.319
amongst a group of strangers.

21:35.321 --> 21:37.672
I mean it's, it's provocative.

21:38.760 --> 21:39.628
[Rachel] Very provocative.

21:39.630 --> 21:40.411
Whoa.

21:40.413 --> 21:41.761
Thanks, man.

21:41.763 --> 21:42.979
Provocativeness
in its boldest form.

21:42.981 --> 21:44.459
But I mean not just
for the viewer,

21:44.461 --> 21:45.982
but for your own personal being.

21:45.984 --> 21:47.331
Nicole, can you please stop?

21:47.333 --> 21:50.030
I'm trying to have
a conversation.

21:50.032 --> 21:52.946
Hands where I can
see them, right guys?

21:52.948 --> 21:56.906
Hey, Trevor, did you know
that Rachel is a writer?

21:56.908 --> 21:57.820
Oh, really?

21:57.822 --> 21:58.778
[Rachel] No.

21:58.780 --> 21:59.909
No, I did not know that.

21:59.911 --> 22:01.345
I'm not really a writer.

22:01.347 --> 22:02.869
I don't know.

22:02.871 --> 22:04.958
I haven't really put pen to
paper in a very long time.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.221
Do you just have
nothing to write about?

22:07.223 --> 22:10.093
There's always
something to write about.

22:10.095 --> 22:11.616
You know what it is?

22:11.618 --> 22:13.662
I think it has to do with fear.

22:13.664 --> 22:14.445
You know?

22:14.447 --> 22:15.969
[Rachel] Yeah.

22:15.971 --> 22:17.144
Like we as artists, we're
afraid that what we create

22:17.146 --> 22:19.799
is not going to be good enough.

22:19.801 --> 22:21.931
Or, you know, perfect.

22:21.933 --> 22:26.457
The worst enemy to
creativity is self-doubt.

22:26.459 --> 22:27.458
Sylvia Plath.

22:27.460 --> 22:28.679
You studied.

22:29.854 --> 22:32.376
And see, look at how
well she turned out.

22:32.378 --> 22:34.772
Didn't she commit suicide?

22:37.253 --> 22:38.469
She did.

22:38.471 --> 22:39.472
Yeah, man.

22:40.909 --> 22:44.954
You know, it's hard
to find inspiration.

22:44.956 --> 22:45.868
I'm sorry.

22:45.870 --> 22:46.826
I can't hear you.

22:46.828 --> 22:48.653
What was that?

22:48.655 --> 22:52.092
I was saying it's
hard to find inspiration

22:52.094 --> 22:54.094
when your head is in an oven.

22:54.096 --> 22:55.878
[loud laughing]

22:55.880 --> 22:58.446
Ernest, I'm kidding.

22:58.448 --> 22:59.229
Sorry.

22:59.231 --> 23:00.578
Okay.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.884
I'm sorry, I'm just
trying to make a joke.

23:01.886 --> 23:02.885
Okay.

23:02.887 --> 23:03.799
Don't, don't try.

23:03.801 --> 23:06.454
No, but I am serious.

23:06.456 --> 23:09.413
I do think it is hard
to find inspiration.

23:09.415 --> 23:11.546
Well if you sit around
and wait for inspiration,

23:11.548 --> 23:13.200
it might never come, you know.

23:13.202 --> 23:14.984
But that's why I
try to force myself

23:14.986 --> 23:16.812
to write every single day.

23:16.814 --> 23:18.596
Let the juices flow.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.424
Sometimes I'll sit
there for hours.

23:20.426 --> 23:23.993
And other times, phew,
stroke of genius.

23:23.995 --> 23:26.343
Hey, better than
a regular stroke.

23:26.345 --> 23:28.955
I mean, I don't understand
that from an artistic concept,

23:28.957 --> 23:31.566
but from a business
standpoint absolutely.

23:31.568 --> 23:32.961
[Trevor] Yeah.

23:34.049 --> 23:36.179
[Rachel] Oh, wow.

23:36.181 --> 23:38.268
♪ Please sick bitch

23:38.270 --> 23:40.923
I mean I don't want to impose
my beliefs on anyone else,

23:40.925 --> 23:43.970
but it's just, my uncle
died of lung cancer

23:43.972 --> 23:45.972
and he didn't even
smoke in his life.

23:45.974 --> 23:48.888
But his second wife
Marjorie smoked these big...

23:48.890 --> 23:49.889
Ernest?

23:49.891 --> 23:51.762
Shut the fuck up, okay?

23:52.719 --> 23:53.503
Okay.

23:56.898 --> 23:59.899
So tonight was
oddly entertaining.

23:59.901 --> 24:01.988
I thought it was fun.

24:01.990 --> 24:03.078
It was fun.

24:04.557 --> 24:06.688
Hey, I was serious
about what I said before.

24:06.690 --> 24:11.475
If you want to be a writer, I
think you should be a writer.

24:11.477 --> 24:13.086
Write.

24:13.088 --> 24:16.916
The inspiration will come once
you get out of your own way.

24:16.918 --> 24:18.004
Sorry.

24:18.006 --> 24:19.483
I'm like lecturing you.

24:19.485 --> 24:20.920
I'm being a total jerk.

24:20.922 --> 24:22.878
You're not a total jerk.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.576
I mean, God, with the
amount of time I've spent

24:25.578 --> 24:27.709
feeling sorry for myself lately,

24:27.711 --> 24:31.626
I could have written like
three self-help books.

24:31.628 --> 24:34.022
And like nine erotic novels.

24:35.371 --> 24:37.066
You're not a total jerk.

24:37.068 --> 24:39.503
I mean a quasi-jerk, maybe.

24:39.505 --> 24:40.809
That's kind of a given.

24:40.811 --> 24:42.202
A quasi-jerk.

24:42.204 --> 24:46.077
Here I am thinking I just
ruined our first date.

24:59.221 --> 25:00.220
I'll rip your stockings.

25:00.222 --> 25:01.527
I don't care.

25:06.097 --> 25:07.705
Yeah right there.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.011
Right there, right there.

25:09.013 --> 25:10.360
The Holy Spirit.

25:10.362 --> 25:12.364
Mother, father, creator.

25:13.496 --> 25:15.278
With being the
truth on the street.

25:15.280 --> 25:18.455
See, she's got the right idea.

25:18.457 --> 25:20.196
[Rachel] Praise Jesus.

25:20.198 --> 25:22.807
No, but look at her though.

25:22.809 --> 25:25.114
Isn't she beautiful?

25:25.116 --> 25:26.724
Just loving her life.

25:26.726 --> 25:29.989
Not giving a fuck about anything
but the Big Guy upstairs.

25:29.991 --> 25:32.732
[loud honking]

25:33.908 --> 25:37.085
You think I could
ever be free like that?

25:38.521 --> 25:39.737
Probably not.

25:39.739 --> 25:42.090
Yeah, you're probably right.

25:45.006 --> 25:47.006
Well, I think I better go.

25:47.008 --> 25:50.052
'Cause I've got to make sure
that Ernest is still alive.

25:50.054 --> 25:51.184
She is a man-eater

25:51.186 --> 25:53.316
That's very true.

25:53.318 --> 25:54.100
Good night, Trevor.

25:54.102 --> 25:55.146
Hey.

25:56.017 --> 25:57.059
Keep your head out of the oven.

25:57.061 --> 25:59.107
Okay, well I'll try.

26:00.064 --> 26:01.063
Bye.

26:01.065 --> 26:01.892
Bye.

26:05.983 --> 26:08.681
Keep your head out of the oven.

26:09.987 --> 26:12.424
Keep your head out of the oven.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.215
[loud moaning]

26:24.915 --> 26:26.306
[imitates bird calling]

26:26.308 --> 26:27.350
[Nicole] Oh hey!

26:27.352 --> 26:28.134
Oh, don't mind me...

26:28.136 --> 26:29.048
No, no, no, no!

26:29.050 --> 26:30.092
Hey hey, we're done, we're done.

26:30.094 --> 26:30.921
You go.

26:35.099 --> 26:37.319
So I'll call you tomorrow.

26:39.060 --> 26:40.320
When?

26:40.322 --> 26:41.886
Tomorrow.

26:41.888 --> 26:42.975
Looking forward to your call.

26:42.977 --> 26:43.760
Okay.

26:45.718 --> 26:47.022
I had a lovely evening...

26:47.024 --> 26:48.458
[loud slamming]

26:48.460 --> 26:49.851
[Rachel] So, you're
going to call him tomorrow?

26:49.853 --> 26:51.984
[Nicole] I am
literally never going

26:51.986 --> 26:53.988
to see that human again.

26:55.032 --> 26:57.815
He's somehow more
boring than you are.

26:57.817 --> 26:58.601
Boring?!

27:00.907 --> 27:05.823
Let me tell you, I macramed
a potholder last week, okay?

27:05.825 --> 27:08.219
On two cups of decaf coffee.

27:09.264 --> 27:11.090
Let's talk about boring.

27:11.092 --> 27:14.093
Do you remember when
you use to be fun, Rach?

27:14.095 --> 27:16.225
We used to stay out
every single night

27:16.227 --> 27:19.837
till six a.m., shit house drunk,

27:19.839 --> 27:22.144
dancing out little tushies off,

27:22.146 --> 27:25.930
talking the L train of
shame home every morning.

27:25.932 --> 27:28.150
Oh yeah, and
getting pussy scooped

27:28.152 --> 27:31.588
by the heinous bouncer
at the Lit Lounge.

27:31.590 --> 27:35.288
Or how about when I was
holding your hair back

27:35.290 --> 27:40.295
while you were puking up
bile in Marcus Garvey Park?

27:41.122 --> 27:43.167
The dictionary definition, fun.

27:44.429 --> 27:47.126
God, those were the days.

27:47.128 --> 27:49.130
September 27th 2012.

27:50.479 --> 27:53.871
Cutting The Cord, A
poem by Rachel Nolan.

What?!

28:07.191 --> 28:08.277
This isn't funny.

28:08.279 --> 28:09.974
Are you embarrassed?

28:09.976 --> 28:12.151
This is who you are, okay?

28:12.153 --> 28:14.327
Look at us, we are youngish,

28:14.329 --> 28:15.850
better than average looking,

28:15.852 --> 28:18.200
weirdo artsy types
living in the best

28:18.202 --> 28:20.159
god-damned city in
the world, okay?

28:20.161 --> 28:21.551
I'd say we have it
pretty fucking good.

28:21.553 --> 28:24.163
And you, you have a book deal.

28:24.165 --> 28:26.208
I don't have a book deal.

28:26.210 --> 28:28.645
Okay, I have a shitty
manuscript that continuously

28:28.647 --> 28:31.257
gets ripped to shreds and
it will never be good enough

28:31.259 --> 28:33.259
to publish and I'm
fucking over it.

28:33.261 --> 28:34.305
Okay?

28:35.567 --> 28:38.133
Oh, Negative Nancy, I
didn't see you arrive.

28:38.135 --> 28:40.266
Okay, I'm Negative Nancy now.

28:40.268 --> 28:44.835
I don't know, Rach, but
I don't know who this is.

28:44.837 --> 28:47.229
Richard turned you
into this conservative

28:47.231 --> 28:51.277
little cardigan wearing
house trained Stepford Wife.

28:51.279 --> 28:53.192
This is not you.

28:53.194 --> 28:55.455
Okay, well since you
obviously know me better

28:55.457 --> 28:59.154
than I know myself, if
'Rachel' was here right now

28:59.156 --> 29:00.416
what would she be doing?

29:00.418 --> 29:01.722
She wouldn't be here.

29:01.724 --> 29:03.158
She would be with
Trevor having a hot

29:03.160 --> 29:04.246
and heavy make-out sesh.

29:04.248 --> 29:05.552
Depending on his worthiness,

29:05.554 --> 29:07.293
probably feeling his
boner a little bit

29:07.295 --> 29:10.034
but keeping it classy and not
fucking on the first date.

29:10.036 --> 29:11.297
Okay, is that
what she would do?

29:11.299 --> 29:12.341
Yeah.

29:12.343 --> 29:13.127
She would.

29:14.432 --> 29:18.349
Well I don't know who
you think I am or was

29:19.307 --> 29:23.267
or should be, but I'm
not that person anymore.

29:24.529 --> 29:28.140
Yeah, well, maybe
you should be.

29:28.142 --> 29:30.274
Because that person was fun.

29:31.362 --> 29:33.451
A lot happier than you are.

29:40.328 --> 29:43.546
[Rachel] Richard
Goux made sense.

29:43.548 --> 29:46.419
He was not what I wanted.

29:46.421 --> 29:48.205
Deep down I knew that.

29:49.902 --> 29:53.295
But my life so far
had been a series

29:53.297 --> 29:57.345
of unfulfilled dreams
and unfulfilled desires.

29:59.260 --> 30:01.262
So I tried not to dream.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.178
Not to desire.

30:06.180 --> 30:07.181
Not to feel.

30:08.704 --> 30:12.708
An empty vessel I gave
myself to him completely.

30:14.971 --> 30:18.407
Blended into him
with the hope he'd

30:18.409 --> 30:21.280
mold me into
something worthwhile.

30:21.282 --> 30:22.237
[Narrator] Hey, girl.

30:22.239 --> 30:23.325
[Rachel] Jesus.

30:23.327 --> 30:24.805
Jessica.

30:24.807 --> 30:27.677
You look like you've been
dragged through the mud.

30:27.679 --> 30:29.549
Do you want to go to lunch?

30:29.551 --> 30:31.290
You know, not today.

30:31.292 --> 30:33.683
I'm sorry, I'm kind of...

30:33.685 --> 30:36.382
You always say that.

30:36.384 --> 30:38.297
Look, Jessica, Richard
and I just broke up.

30:38.299 --> 30:39.907
I'm not really in the mood...

30:39.909 --> 30:40.864
I know.

30:40.866 --> 30:42.388
I saw it on the internet.

I won't, I swear.

56:52.872 --> 56:54.219
Okay.

56:54.221 --> 56:55.873
She said that after
giving him oral sex,

56:55.875 --> 57:01.010
she felt so guilty about it
that she cried on his penis.

57:01.706 --> 57:02.618
[Rachel] Oh my God.

57:02.620 --> 57:03.532
I know, I can't believe it.

57:03.534 --> 57:04.927
It's totally embarrassing.

57:06.407 --> 57:07.798
[Nicole] Make your famous
popcorn for Dog Tooth.

57:07.800 --> 57:10.409
What are you so happy about?

57:10.411 --> 57:11.584
Who's that?

57:11.586 --> 57:12.803
[Rachel] It's nobody.

57:12.805 --> 57:15.022
No, like seriously
who was that?

57:15.024 --> 57:16.676
Oh my God, what's his name?

57:16.678 --> 57:18.460
It's nobody you know.

57:18.462 --> 57:19.897
Plus I don't want to jinx it.

57:19.899 --> 57:22.029
Well be careful, Rachel.

57:22.031 --> 57:24.945
You know, you don't want
to rush into these things.

57:24.947 --> 57:26.904
You still have a fragile heart.

57:26.906 --> 57:29.865
[perky Italian music]

57:36.959 --> 57:39.440
[loud honking]

57:45.750 --> 57:50.755
[loud screaming]
[speaking foreign language]

57:55.499 --> 57:57.804
This movie is so weird.

57:57.806 --> 57:58.674
I know.

57:58.676 --> 58:01.244
[loud screaming]

58:04.421 --> 58:05.335
I'm cold.

58:10.993 --> 58:12.952
Oh my God, look at this.

58:23.092 --> 58:25.397
[Rachel] She called
herself an open book.

58:25.399 --> 58:28.095
Which may have been true.

58:28.097 --> 58:30.402
A book with faded print.

58:30.404 --> 58:33.057
Written in a language
with no rules.

58:33.059 --> 58:36.060
No structure whatsoever.

58:36.062 --> 58:39.456
But so intriguing is
the art of the chase.

58:40.457 --> 58:41.979
So attractive is the...

58:41.981 --> 58:44.548
[loud slamming]

58:46.202 --> 58:49.116
Trevor really likes you.

58:49.118 --> 58:52.424
Have you talked
to Cameron at all?

58:52.426 --> 58:53.209
Nope.

58:54.384 --> 58:57.603
Maybe he was getting
his feet fucked.

58:57.605 --> 59:00.519
It's the only viable excuse.

59:00.521 --> 59:05.132
It was weird the stuff he
was saying about sexuality.

59:05.134 --> 59:08.440
Yeah, I try not to
listen when he speaks.

59:08.442 --> 59:11.008
The stuff about like
women not being able

59:11.010 --> 59:13.577
to separate sex from emotion.

59:15.014 --> 59:18.058
Oh yeah, and about us
chowing each others' boxes.

59:18.060 --> 59:21.020
And look, we put it
all into practice.

59:23.065 --> 59:26.023
Should we talk about that?

59:26.025 --> 59:28.025
What is there to talk about?

59:28.027 --> 59:29.983
We're cool, right?

59:29.985 --> 59:30.986
Yeah.

59:35.077 --> 59:37.164
Sorry about Cameron.

59:37.166 --> 59:38.037
Don't be.

59:44.826 --> 59:45.958
Good night.

59:47.394 --> 59:50.310
[melancholy music]

59:56.098 --> 59:58.971
[loud slapping]

01:00:05.586 --> 01:00:07.499
Do you want to go to
lunch with Jessica and I?

01:00:07.501 --> 01:00:08.804
No thanks.

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:12.156
I have a date with
the professor today.

01:00:12.158 --> 01:00:12.985
Oh.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.638
What are you doing with that?

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.120
What do you mean?

01:00:19.426 --> 01:00:22.081
Like, what are
your intentions?

01:00:23.517 --> 01:00:24.997
To go to lunch,

01:00:26.172 --> 01:00:28.911
maybe take his photograph?

01:00:28.913 --> 01:00:32.263
Are you trying
to, what, date him?

01:00:32.265 --> 01:00:33.090
Why not?

01:00:33.092 --> 01:00:34.091
He's brilliant.

01:00:34.093 --> 01:00:34.917
He's charming.

01:00:34.919 --> 01:00:36.354
Devastatingly handsome.

01:00:36.356 --> 01:00:38.617
You're just going to end
up hurting him, Nicole.

01:00:38.619 --> 01:00:40.140
I know you.

01:00:40.142 --> 01:00:41.707
You're going to have your fun,

01:00:41.709 --> 01:00:44.231
and you're just going
to toss him aside.

01:00:44.233 --> 01:00:46.061
It's not going to last.

01:00:48.672 --> 01:00:51.023
Well, like you said, Rach,

01:00:52.285 --> 01:00:56.417
he's an old man so I'm
pretty sure he knows how to

01:00:56.419 --> 01:01:00.597
handle himself by now, but
thanks for your concern.

01:01:10.781 --> 01:01:13.434
You look really pretty.

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:15.047
Thanks, you too.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.932
[melancholy music]

01:01:48.645 --> 01:01:49.949
[Rachel] Tell the professor

01:01:49.951 --> 01:01:53.607
I said [speaks
foreign language].

01:01:58.133 --> 01:01:59.741
[Nicole] And this
is why we're here.

01:01:59.743 --> 01:02:01.308
I don't know what it is with
all the beautiful things

01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:03.789
in here I keep
going back to this.

01:02:03.791 --> 01:02:05.312
Isn't it gorgeous?

01:02:05.314 --> 01:02:07.184
Absolutely.

01:02:07.186 --> 01:02:08.794
Like you, my dear.

01:02:08.796 --> 01:02:09.708
Stop it.

01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:11.188
No don't stop, keep going.

01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:13.146
[loud laughing]

01:02:13.148 --> 01:02:15.148
Here, please do me
the honor of posing

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:16.758
right here on this pillar.

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.064
Oh no, no, no.

01:02:18.066 --> 01:02:20.197
Please, Professore,
you can't, you have to.

01:02:20.199 --> 01:02:21.676
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:02:21.678 --> 01:02:22.592
Okay, okay.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.203
[Narrator] You've
reached Charles Harwell.

01:02:26.205 --> 01:02:27.726
Please leave a detailed message.

01:02:27.728 --> 01:02:31.469
Hey, Charles, it's
Rachel, Rachel Nolan.

01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:35.429
Look, please give me
a call back, okay?

01:02:35.431 --> 01:02:36.432
Thanks, bye.

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:39.305
Okay, ready?

01:02:41.698 --> 01:02:43.829
[Nicole speaks in
foreign language]

01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:45.657
Professor, I don't
mean to alarm you.

01:02:45.659 --> 01:02:47.224
You are extremely handsome.

01:02:47.226 --> 01:02:48.442
Now, don't break character.

01:02:48.444 --> 01:02:50.009
Let's go, let's
go, stoic, serious.

01:02:50.011 --> 01:02:50.836
Ready?

01:02:50.838 --> 01:02:51.793
Okay.

01:02:51.795 --> 01:02:55.799
[Nicole speaks foreign language]

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:39.321
[loud ringing]

01:03:41.454 --> 01:03:42.279
Hi, mom.

01:03:42.281 --> 01:03:43.628
[Mom] Hi, stranger.

01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:44.411
Mom...

01:03:44.413 --> 01:03:45.717
Oh I know, I know.

01:03:45.719 --> 01:03:47.109
I'm putting it on
a little too thick,

01:03:47.111 --> 01:03:49.764
but I just miss you, that's all.

01:03:49.766 --> 01:03:50.983
[Rachel] How's dad?

01:03:50.985 --> 01:03:53.377
Oh, you know dad.

01:03:53.379 --> 01:03:54.204
He's the same.

01:03:54.206 --> 01:03:55.117
He's fine.

01:03:55.119 --> 01:03:56.554
Hey, how are you?

01:03:56.556 --> 01:03:57.859
How is work?

01:03:57.861 --> 01:04:00.558
Oh well, you know,
it's a paycheck.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.646
Every week.

01:04:01.648 --> 01:04:02.951
Yeah?

01:04:02.953 --> 01:04:05.302
How is that essay
thing coming along?

01:04:05.304 --> 01:04:07.521
It's a novel, mom.

01:04:07.523 --> 01:04:11.221
And it's, it's going
to fall through.

01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:13.225
Oh, honey, I am so sorry.

01:04:16.315 --> 01:04:20.404
Well, I always say you only
learn by bad experiences.

01:04:20.406 --> 01:04:23.102
Yep, you do always say that.

01:04:23.104 --> 01:04:25.452
Rachel, I know the
nine-to-five isn't all the glitz

01:04:25.454 --> 01:04:27.541
and glamour that
you could imagine,

01:04:27.543 --> 01:04:30.022
but you are a sensible girl,

01:04:30.024 --> 01:04:33.286
and I don't know,
maybe you could

01:04:33.288 --> 01:04:35.114
do that writing thing
as a hobby, huh?

01:04:35.116 --> 01:04:36.248
Or just for fun.

01:04:37.466 --> 01:04:38.467
Yeah, fun.

01:04:39.338 --> 01:04:40.467
Yeah.

01:04:40.469 --> 01:04:42.426
And then when you and Richard,

01:04:42.428 --> 01:04:46.821
you settle down and talk
about raising a family.

01:04:46.823 --> 01:04:48.475
You're really
going to appreciate

01:04:48.477 --> 01:04:50.216
having that paycheck
once a week.

01:04:50.218 --> 01:04:51.480
Believe you me.

01:04:54.483 --> 01:04:59.051
The boundaries of
relationships are a farce.

01:04:59.053 --> 01:05:02.359
You know, they're just
like, they're not there.

01:05:02.361 --> 01:05:05.100
Because when you're
in a relationship,

01:05:05.102 --> 01:05:06.885
you're in it.

01:05:06.887 --> 01:05:09.757
Well no one's like
really in it, in it.

01:05:09.759 --> 01:05:12.194
You know what I mean?

01:05:12.196 --> 01:05:14.677
It's just me and I'm all alone.

01:05:18.464 --> 01:05:20.640
My heart was once like this.

01:05:23.033 --> 01:05:24.383
But now it's this.

01:05:29.431 --> 01:05:30.258
I mean,

01:05:32.521 --> 01:05:34.610
you know how I'm feeling.

01:05:35.785 --> 01:05:37.352
You were in Vietnam.

01:05:40.529 --> 01:05:41.789
Hold on.

01:05:41.791 --> 01:05:43.924
I'm going to make a call.

01:05:45.404 --> 01:05:46.405
Hello?

01:05:47.884 --> 01:05:49.449
You've got to,

01:05:49.451 --> 01:05:51.540
you've got to press dial.

01:05:53.368 --> 01:05:54.541
[loud ringing]

01:05:54.543 --> 01:05:55.368
[loud honking]

01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:56.543
Hello?

01:05:56.545 --> 01:05:58.417
Wondering where I am?

01:06:00.462 --> 01:06:01.766
Where are you?

01:06:01.768 --> 01:06:03.245
I don't know.

01:06:03.247 --> 01:06:04.423
Where are you?

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:07.032
I'm walking home.

01:06:07.034 --> 01:06:08.860
How much have you had to drink?

01:06:08.862 --> 01:06:10.122
Not enough.

01:06:10.124 --> 01:06:14.169
Because my heart is
still [blows raspberry].

01:06:14.171 --> 01:06:15.475
Please find out where you are.

01:06:15.477 --> 01:06:17.608
How am I supposed to do that?

01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:19.958
Hand the phone to someone
less drunk than you.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:23.004
That would be anyone in the bar.

01:06:23.006 --> 01:06:25.267
[loud thud]

01:06:25.269 --> 01:06:26.401
You've got it.

01:06:31.798 --> 01:06:33.450
Hello, can you help me?

01:06:33.452 --> 01:06:34.973
I don't know where I am.

01:06:34.975 --> 01:06:36.540
Oh, oh hello?

01:06:36.542 --> 01:06:38.498
Honey, she's at Louie's.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.021
[Nicole] Gracias, can you
give her the phone please?

01:06:40.023 --> 01:06:40.761
Okay.

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:41.936
Thank you so much.

01:06:41.938 --> 01:06:42.807
Thank you.

01:06:42.809 --> 01:06:43.590
[Attendant] Sure.

01:06:43.592 --> 01:06:45.636
You're really like.

01:06:45.638 --> 01:06:46.898
Here, thank you.

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:49.030
Oh jeez, I'm so sorry.

01:06:49.032 --> 01:06:50.467
Okay, sure.

01:06:50.469 --> 01:06:51.470
Thank you.

01:06:52.688 --> 01:06:54.209
Thank you, thank you.

01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:56.690
- Ah, it's okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:06:56.692 --> 01:06:59.216
[Attendant] This will pass.

01:07:02.394 --> 01:07:04.350
[slow paced music]

01:07:04.352 --> 01:07:05.699
Dee de dit.

01:07:05.701 --> 01:07:07.571
Dee de dit.

01:07:07.573 --> 01:07:08.400
Whoo!

01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:11.577
This one's for you, Roger!

01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:14.665
Look at me now boys!

01:07:14.667 --> 01:07:15.622
Okay, Shirley Temple.

01:07:15.624 --> 01:07:16.623
Time to go home.

01:07:16.625 --> 01:07:19.411
Nikki, it's so
good to see you!

01:07:20.847 --> 01:07:22.063
Oh, look, look.

01:07:22.065 --> 01:07:23.284
This is Roger.

01:07:24.546 --> 01:07:25.371
[Nicole] Hi Roger.

01:07:25.373 --> 01:07:26.894
His mother is Greek.

01:07:26.896 --> 01:07:28.940
His father is not Greek.

01:07:28.942 --> 01:07:29.725
Great.

01:07:31.248 --> 01:07:33.118
But, we're going to be
travelling the world together

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.772
on his motorcycle.

01:07:34.774 --> 01:07:36.034
Okay, it's time to go home.

01:07:36.036 --> 01:07:37.775
I don't even
have a motorcycle.

01:07:37.777 --> 01:07:39.341
We're actors.

01:07:39.343 --> 01:07:40.734
We're just here, we
just got off set.

01:07:40.736 --> 01:07:42.170
This isn't even a real goatee.

01:07:42.172 --> 01:07:44.216
Roger, I don't care.

I hope you know this is not
about you letting me down.

more time, I'm sure...
