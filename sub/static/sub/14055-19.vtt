00:02.924 --> 00:05.324
These are friends, looking
forward to getting to know you.

00:05.404 --> 00:06.244
You son of a bitch.

00:06.244 --> 00:07.884
Your cue to hand me the briefcase.

00:07.964 --> 00:11.444
If I'd never had sex before,
why do I feel so horny?

00:11.444 --> 00:14.484
My old assistant is the VP of Development
at a graphic novel company.

00:14.604 --> 00:15.644
I arranged the meeting.

00:15.644 --> 00:18.204
You and Kirsten have been spending
a lot of time working together.

00:18.244 --> 00:20.044
A lot of hours, late nights.

00:20.044 --> 00:21.004
Sandy, you have a great wife.

00:21.004 --> 00:23.804
Why would Trey steal anything, though?
I mean, everything's going great, right?

00:23.924 --> 00:27.844
I screwed up. There's no way Ryan's
ever gonna forgive me. I don't blame him.

00:27.924 --> 00:28.764
I'll talk to him.

00:28.764 --> 00:31.484
In the morning, he's gone.
I don't care where he goes.

00:39.684 --> 00:42.724
- Morning.
- Morning, Mr. Cohen.

00:43.284 --> 00:47.044
So today's the big day, huh?
Moving in to your new apartment.

00:48.204 --> 00:49.484
You got all your stuff?

00:49.844 --> 00:51.284
Yeah, there's not much to get.

00:51.364 --> 00:53.124
- You sure you don't need anything?
- No, thanks.

00:53.124 --> 00:54.484
You guys have already done
more than enough.

00:54.564 --> 00:57.524
Well, you're Ryan's brother.
We're happy to help.

00:57.604 --> 01:01.084
Still, there's-there's not many people
who would take in an ex-con.

01:01.724 --> 01:02.804
He's lucky to have you.

01:02.924 --> 01:07.764
Well, you're part of this family now,
so if anything comes up... we're here.

01:08.084 --> 01:08.804
Thanks.

01:08.844 --> 01:09.964
Grab yourself some breakfast.

01:10.084 --> 01:12.604
I'll, uh... I'll drop you by your place
on my way to work.

01:12.684 --> 01:15.964
I'm not really hungry,
but I will take you up on the ride.

01:17.324 --> 01:21.204
- Did you tell Ryan you're leaving?
- No, but it's okay.

01:22.964 --> 01:24.644
Yeah, I don't know what
happened with you guys.

01:24.884 --> 01:26.084
In fact, I don't want to know.

01:26.164 --> 01:27.804
And it doesn't matter
who was wrong,

01:27.924 --> 01:30.084
but someone's gonna have
to be the first to reach out.

01:31.724 --> 01:33.004
There he is.

01:33.484 --> 01:36.324
I tell you, the timing in
this household is a thing of beauty.

01:37.484 --> 01:39.684
I'm gonna leave you two
to say your good-byes.

01:39.884 --> 01:41.764
Trey, I'll be in the car.

01:46.124 --> 01:47.804
Sandy's giving me a lift over
to the apartment.

01:47.804 --> 01:49.124
You got everything?

01:50.404 --> 01:54.164
You know, it's weird, being able
to fit your whole life into one bag.

01:56.164 --> 01:57.804
Look, Ryan,

01:58.604 --> 02:00.764
I know it hasn't been easy, man,
but I want you to know that

02:00.764 --> 02:02.684
I appreciate everything
you and the Cohens have done for me.

02:02.684 --> 02:04.124
Great way of showing it.

02:04.844 --> 02:08.764
Look, I'm sorry, Ryan, okay?
I screwed up.

02:09.204 --> 02:12.524
And you and Seth and Marissa--
you guys saved my ass. I know that.

02:12.644 --> 02:14.884
Would you please just accept my apology?

02:21.484 --> 02:23.564
Don't keep Sandy waiting.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.276
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

03:16.356 --> 03:17.396
What's up?

03:17.996 --> 03:20.756
So, uh, Ryan, doesn't Trey move
into the apartment today?

03:21.076 --> 03:23.116
Uh, yeah, he left this morning.

03:23.756 --> 03:26.516
Well, don't you think maybe we should go by
there and give him a housewarming gift?

03:26.636 --> 03:27.996
That's all right.
He doesn't need anything.

03:28.076 --> 03:31.876
You sure? He doesn't exactly
seem overburdened with possessions,

03:32.236 --> 03:34.596
unless that bag of his
is like Mary Poppins'.

03:34.956 --> 03:36.436
I wish I'd never made that reference.

03:36.556 --> 03:40.436
Look, uh, he's got his own place,
he's out of our lives. Just let him go.

03:41.476 --> 03:45.476
You know, you think maybe it's time to
forgive him for the whole yard sale thing?

03:45.516 --> 03:46.796
It wasn't a thing, Seth. He stole.

03:46.876 --> 03:48.476
Only because he wanted to be near you.

03:48.476 --> 03:53.996
I appreciate what you guys are doing,
but he's my brother. Just leave him alone.

03:56.596 --> 03:57.436
Come in. Good morning.

03:57.436 --> 04:01.996
Kirsten, congratulations. As of this morning,
you are a bona fide magazine publisher.

04:01.996 --> 04:04.196
I know. The first issue's on the stands.

04:04.196 --> 04:06.276
I was referring to our very first liable suit.

04:06.276 --> 04:08.956
- What?!
- Nick Morton. Newport Beach politico.

04:09.076 --> 04:12.036
Doesn't like the profile we ran.
Thinks it makes him look sleazy.

04:12.036 --> 04:14.676
- You wrote that profile.
- I know. I made him look sleazy.

04:14.676 --> 04:17.435
- Well, what are we supposed to do?
- I thought I'd talk to Sandy.

04:18.236 --> 04:21.116
Yeah, you guys are friends now, so great.

04:21.555 --> 04:26.116
Julie's on her way over. I have to explain
to her why she's not on the cover anymore.

04:26.196 --> 04:29.596
Hey, she's been to Europe, you know?
Maybe she's become this ...

04:29.836 --> 04:33.516
un-materialistic, humble, sweet person.

04:33.516 --> 04:36.196
- Carter, we're talking about Julie.
- What about her?

04:36.476 --> 04:41.036
Julie... you're... We were just saying
how glad we are you're back.

04:41.116 --> 04:43.036
Oh, well, thank you, Kirsten.

04:43.076 --> 04:44.596
- Carter.
- Julie.

04:44.716 --> 04:45.676
So, how was Italy?

04:45.676 --> 04:47.916
Well, Cal is still in Rome
--some business thingy-- but

04:47.916 --> 04:51.076
scandal or no scandal, I had
to be back for our first issue.

04:52.036 --> 04:54.836
Julie, there's something
that I need to tell you.

04:54.996 --> 04:59.796
- Uh, after the whole...
- Porno debacle. You can say it.

05:00.356 --> 05:02.756
There were letters. Lots of letters.

05:02.916 --> 05:06.116
And then, the advertisers
started threatening to cancel.

05:07.156 --> 05:10.036
So we had to take you off the cover.
I'm sorry.

05:13.196 --> 05:13.876
You did the right thing.

05:13.876 --> 05:16.636
- I did?
- Absolutely. Don't give it another thought.

05:17.756 --> 05:22.116
God, it's really good to see you.
Both of you. I really missed you.

05:24.636 --> 05:27.316
I'm just saying, maybe I should do
the talking this time.

05:27.316 --> 05:31.836
Zach, do not worry, okay? I promise you,
this won't be another wild storm.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.716
Look, I am calm, I am well-rested.

05:35.236 --> 05:38.036
Plus, Reed's already read the pages,
and he freaking loves them.

05:38.036 --> 05:39.996
He's driving all the way
from L.A. just to meet us.

05:40.476 --> 05:42.556
So what do we know
about this guy? What's he like?

05:42.556 --> 05:45.356
I just know that he's Carter's assistant
before going to work at Bad Science.

05:45.556 --> 05:46.636
We've only E-mailed.

05:46.916 --> 05:49.516
Dude, I still can't believe we're going
to have our own graphic novel.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.956
I know.

05:52.636 --> 05:53.956
I just can't believe it's 2005.

05:53.956 --> 05:56.716
Weren't we supposed to have personal jet
packs by now? Who dropped the ball?

05:56.796 --> 05:58.156
What are you talking about?

05:59.156 --> 06:03.356
Oh, hey, Summer. We were just, um...
Mm. We were...

06:03.356 --> 06:05.356
Talking about your comic.
Don't lie, okay?

06:05.556 --> 06:08.836
Graphic novel. It's... whatever.
It's just a little different.

06:13.996 --> 06:17.236
All right, well, I'm gonna head to class.
And, uh, have a good one.

06:21.876 --> 06:23.076
I'm sorry, okay?

06:23.116 --> 06:26.596
I know, I promised it wouldn't be weird,
but I'm telling you this. From here on out,

06:27.476 --> 06:30.436
full disclosure, okay?
I'll tell you everything Zach and I do,

06:30.436 --> 06:33.556
and I'm going to let you know
the ins and outs of whatever.

06:33.556 --> 06:34.556
- No.
- And... What?

06:34.556 --> 06:38.716
Look, I think that you and Zach working
together is a bad idea, but I can't stop it.

06:38.756 --> 06:40.276
- Summer, come on.
- No, so here's the deal.

06:40.276 --> 06:43.636
Whatever happens, I don't want
to know anything about it.

06:43.836 --> 06:47.356
Which means, as far as I'm concerned,
your little comic doesn't exist.

06:48.596 --> 06:49.956
Graphic novel.

06:53.996 --> 06:56.956
A surfboard coffee table.
I am in the O.C.

06:57.036 --> 07:01.796
Carter, it's good to see you. Yup, a little
carpentry project while I'm between cases.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.396
Well, I came at the right time.
You ever do any liable work?

07:04.396 --> 07:07.476
Wow. One day on the stand, you've
already got a liable suit. Not bad.

07:07.556 --> 07:09.196
- Not bad. Who is it?
- Nick Morton.

07:09.316 --> 07:10.756
Oh, sleaze bag.

07:10.876 --> 07:13.116
Mm. Well, he doesn't like
to be called one in print.

07:13.116 --> 07:16.756
Oh, I'd be happy to help out. Liable
cases are notoriously hard to prove.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.356
I'm assuming all
your quotes are verbatim?

07:18.356 --> 07:20.676
Yeah, word for word.
I'll give you the interview tapes.

07:20.676 --> 07:22.116
Great, should be a breeze.

07:22.276 --> 07:25.916
You know, I used to surf. I grew up
in Long Island. Montauk Point, West End.

07:25.916 --> 07:27.556
I'm heading out tomorrow.
Why don't you come with me?

07:27.556 --> 07:30.876
Oh, I don't know. It's been such
a long time. I don't have a board.

07:31.036 --> 07:32.156
I'll lend you one.

07:32.356 --> 07:34.476
And if Kirsten asks why
I'm not at work?

07:34.476 --> 07:36.916
You can tell her we'll be talking
about the case.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.076
Marissa.

07:44.236 --> 07:45.716
I brought you a little something.

07:48.796 --> 07:53.956
Wow. That's a lava lamp.
That's, uh... that's great.

07:54.076 --> 07:56.916
Ryan wanted to come, but he had
this thing after school.

07:59.316 --> 08:01.196
Oh... come in.

08:02.196 --> 08:04.316
I still haven't bought chairs
and tables and stuff, but...

08:04.396 --> 08:05.316
Nice beanbag.

08:05.316 --> 08:08.116
Yeah. It's kind of a stupid first thing
to buy. I've always wanted one.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.316
It's kind of an early
birthday present to myself.

08:10.396 --> 08:13.676
- When's your birthday?
- Saturday. Uh, big two-one.

08:14.116 --> 08:18.196
Though after being in prison, you know, being
able to buy beer feels a little anti-climactic.

08:21.356 --> 08:24.756
Uh, do you want something to drink?
I've got one glass, but I can wash it.

08:24.876 --> 08:28.036
No, no, that's okay. Um, I should
get going, but I'll see you later.

08:28.036 --> 08:29.676
- Sure. Thanks again.

08:34.476 --> 08:36.676
He said he'd have
all our stuff with him.

08:37.716 --> 08:44.636
- Um... Seth.
- Oh, my God. Oh!

08:45.156 --> 08:49.916
He's a she. That's terrible. Listen, Zach,
I love girls, and I love comics.

08:50.196 --> 08:53.436
The two do not mix, okay? It's going to be,
like, "Let's make their outfits cuter..."

08:53.436 --> 08:56.316
Dude, we're here. Let's just give
her the benefit of the doubt.

08:57.596 --> 09:01.836
You must be my two wunderkinds.
Reed Carlson, Bad Science Comics.

09:01.836 --> 09:03.716
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Zach, this is Seth.

09:03.796 --> 09:05.756
I can't tell you how much I've been
looking forward to this meeting.

09:05.836 --> 09:08.316
Oh, that's great. Let's just
get right to the project.

09:08.396 --> 09:12.596
Okay. I think that you have tapped
into something real and compelling.

09:12.676 --> 09:16.676
I think the characters are vivid
and engaging. Especially the Ironist.

09:16.876 --> 09:19.236
- Really?
- Yeah, he's smart, funny, hip.

09:19.356 --> 09:21.436
He is unlike anyone else in comics.

09:21.556 --> 09:24.076
Wow, well, can I, uh, first, just say

09:24.236 --> 09:27.596
how great it is to finally see
a woman involved in comics

09:28.236 --> 09:28.716
Thank you.

09:28.716 --> 09:31.636
We were actually thinking of expanding
the Ironist's role a little bit. Uh...

09:31.636 --> 09:33.196
I have to ask, who came up
with this business plan?

09:33.316 --> 09:35.596
- Uh, I did.
- It's amazing.

09:35.596 --> 09:36.236
Really?

09:36.316 --> 09:38.476
I mean, I was a marketing
minor in college, but

09:38.556 --> 09:42.436
the fact that you put this together,
and you're 17... I'm in awe.

09:42.516 --> 09:45.956
You're like a Doogie Howser
meets Gordon Gekko, but with dimples.

09:46.036 --> 09:47.996
Well, I'm glad you liked it.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.636
Uh, that's my boss.
Just a sec?

09:52.636 --> 09:58.076
Oh, hey, genius boy? Zach, right?
Could you order me an ice tea?

09:59.836 --> 10:01.916
God, how great is it
she liked my business plan?

10:02.036 --> 10:04.396
Yeah, that's really very...
It's very cool.

10:06.716 --> 10:07.596
Hey, what's up?

10:07.676 --> 10:08.956
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.316
So what's going on? You hungry,
you want something to drink?

10:11.476 --> 10:12.956
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

10:13.236 --> 10:15.276
I just came by to ask you something.

10:15.476 --> 10:18.636
- Oh, okay, sure.
- Okay, uh...

10:18.996 --> 10:23.516
don't get mad, but I was thinking it might
be nice to throw Trey a birthday party.

10:25.396 --> 10:27.716
- What?
- We could do it at my house by the pool.

10:29.076 --> 10:37.436
- You forgot, Saturday's his birthday.
- No, I... Yeah. Yeah, I did.

10:39.476 --> 10:40.996
You went over to see him, didn't you?

10:41.156 --> 10:42.836
- Ryan.
- After I asked you not to.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.836
I brought him a lava lamp.
It was no big deal.

10:45.916 --> 10:47.236
Why are you doing all this?

10:47.996 --> 10:50.316
Going over to see him, wanting
to throw him a birthday party?

10:50.316 --> 10:54.516
- He's your brother.
- Exactly. He's my brother.

10:56.076 --> 10:57.956
And if everyone had just let me
handle it from the beginning,

10:57.956 --> 10:59.556
then none of this would have happened.

11:00.836 --> 11:03.516
So I'm asking you again.
Stop pushing it.

11:03.756 --> 11:09.196
I'm sorry. It's...
Sorry.

11:19.064 --> 11:26.424
Ryan, wake up. Ryan, wake up.
No, get your own.

11:26.511 --> 11:30.311
Wake up, man. It's a beautiful day. The
sun's shining, the birds are, you know.

11:30.711 --> 11:33.111
Did I happen to mention to you
last night about meeting Reed?

11:33.191 --> 11:35.871
Beautiful, loves comics, promises
to make you famous? Yes.

11:35.991 --> 11:38.031
So, here's the thing.
I'm a little bit worried about Zach.

11:38.111 --> 11:38.991
Z ach.

11:39.151 --> 11:43.231
Yeah. You should have seen him at the
meeting. He was like Reed this, Reed that.

11:43.231 --> 11:46.151
- It was kind of disgusting.
- And you sure it's Zach who has the crush?

11:46.751 --> 11:49.711
I love Summer, okay?
Reed is a colleague.

11:50.431 --> 11:52.271
I just don't want her
to like Zach more than me.

11:52.551 --> 11:55.751
Hey, you know, this is our first conversation
in the pool house since Marissa left.

11:55.831 --> 11:57.471
Let's not talk about Marissa.

11:57.671 --> 12:00.591
What? Come on, we did me.
Let's go around the horn.

12:00.671 --> 12:03.471
We got in a fight yesterday. She wanted
to throw a birthday party for Trey.

12:03.591 --> 12:04.911
It's Trey's birthday?

12:05.951 --> 12:06.591
Seth.

12:06.591 --> 12:11.151
No, hang on. I'm just thinking how,
you know, sometimes it takes an event

12:11.551 --> 12:15.191
like a birthday or a wake to bring
a family together. Think about this.

12:15.391 --> 12:17.911
Trey is blowing out his candles
on his birthday.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.471
His only wish is that
his brother forgives him.

12:21.111 --> 12:22.511
It's a pretty nice moment.

12:28.351 --> 12:30.191
- Good morning.
- Hey.

12:30.471 --> 12:32.791
Oh, it feels so good to be home.

12:33.231 --> 12:36.511
Oh, and how much do I wish you could
have come to visit in Italy. It was...

12:37.631 --> 12:38.391
it was magical.

12:38.391 --> 12:41.351
Yeah? If it was so great, then why'd you come
home early? Everything okay with Caleb?

12:41.351 --> 12:46.631
Of course. I told you, I needed to come
home for the magazine, and I missed you.

12:51.831 --> 12:55.671
Do you have an address?
I should have known.

12:56.911 --> 13:00.231
Honey, I have to go. But let's have
dinner tonight, just the two of us, okay?

13:24.711 --> 13:27.671
Ah, you're just out of practice. Everybody
hits themselves in the face with their boards.

13:27.791 --> 13:31.471
- Three times in one wave?
- Well, that was impressive.

13:32.391 --> 13:36.351
Still... surfing the O.C.--
it's a world away from Long Island.

13:36.471 --> 13:39.151
- Hey, Sandy.
- Erin, how you doing? You going out?

13:39.231 --> 13:42.911
Yeah. I don't have to make rounds for a couple
hours, so I figured I'd get in the water.

13:42.991 --> 13:44.671
- Hi
- Erin, Carter Buckley.

13:44.671 --> 13:47.551
He's running Newport Living,
the magazine my wife's company publishes.

13:47.631 --> 13:49.271
Oh, yeah; that came
to the office yesterday.

13:49.351 --> 13:53.071
I read the profile on Nick Morton.
Way to scare him.

13:53.191 --> 13:55.551
- Carter wrote that.
- And now we're being sued.

13:55.631 --> 13:58.071
Erin's an orthopedist in town,
and an excellent surfer.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.711
Carter's just getting back into it.

14:00.151 --> 14:02.871
Yeah, today I mastered
hitting myself in the face.

14:03.511 --> 14:07.191
Well, anytime Sandy's busy and
you need a surf buddy, give me a call.

14:07.551 --> 14:10.071
- Thank you, I-I might do that.
- See you, guys.

14:13.791 --> 14:16.551
Yeah, it's a world away from
Long Island, I'll tell you.

14:16.591 --> 14:19.871
Okay, and he got mad because you wanted
to throw a party for his brother?

14:19.871 --> 14:22.191
It's not just the party.
It's been building.

14:22.951 --> 14:25.151
Trey coming here has been
really hard for him.

14:25.471 --> 14:26.631
Well, you tried.

14:26.911 --> 14:29.631
If he doesn't want a relationship
with his brother, that's his problem.

14:30.271 --> 14:31.951
I just hate for him to realize,

14:31.951 --> 14:35.071
like two years from now how important his
brother is, and then find out he's lost him.

14:35.071 --> 14:38.351
Oh, my God. You are the most supportive
non-girlfriend in history.

14:38.431 --> 14:42.071
You know if something important was happening
in Seth's life, you'd be there for him.

14:43.071 --> 14:45.151
Right. Of course.

14:45.271 --> 14:46.671
And then when she started talking

14:46.831 --> 14:51.471
about how Iron Man's armor, his old armor,
is actually better than his ultimate armor...?

14:51.791 --> 14:56.911
Dude, what about when she threw down
on the whole Cyclops vs. Storm debate?

14:56.911 --> 15:00.031
I never thought talking about
comic books could be so sexy.

15:00.031 --> 15:04.751
A beautiful girl who loves comics.
I didn't even know they existed.

15:04.751 --> 15:08.871
It's like finding a unicorn, Zach.
It's like finding a really hot unicorn.

15:09.431 --> 15:12.191
You know, it's just too bad you have
a girlfriend, you know? Otherwise...

15:12.191 --> 15:14.311
See, I was thinking
you could ask her out,

15:14.311 --> 15:17.911
but now you're working together, so that's
that whole professional ethics thing.

15:17.911 --> 15:21.991
Yeah, you know, I was wondering, how did
Summer take the fact that Reed's a woman?

15:22.071 --> 15:23.791
She's not bothered by
our late night's work?

15:23.791 --> 15:27.071
Ah, it turns out Summer doesn't want to
know anything about the entire enterprise, so

15:27.191 --> 15:29.031
I couldn't tell her,
even if I wanted to.

15:31.711 --> 15:33.431
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

15:33.551 --> 15:36.391
Actually, we were just
talking about Reed.

15:37.391 --> 15:40.471
- Who's Reed?
- Seth will tell you. See you later.

15:42.391 --> 15:43.391
Who's Reed?

15:43.511 --> 15:46.231
Uh, you don't want to know.
It's a comic book rep.

15:46.351 --> 15:49.271
- No, I do.
- You do?

15:49.351 --> 15:51.351
Yeah. Look, I've changed my mind.

15:51.351 --> 15:54.711
I know this comic book is important
to you, so it's important to me.

15:55.071 --> 15:56.351
I want to know everything.

15:56.871 --> 15:58.711
- Everything?
- Yeah.

16:00.951 --> 16:05.111
- Jules. How the hell did you find me?
- Well, it was easy, Lance.

16:05.231 --> 16:08.391
I just looked for the cheapest, scummiest
motel near a liquor store, and voilà.

16:08.471 --> 16:11.231
- May I come in?
- I guess so.

16:12.871 --> 16:15.471
Listen, Jules. I don't know
what you're thinking, but...

16:17.671 --> 16:19.471
- What the hell is that?
- It's a gun, genius.

16:19.551 --> 16:21.631
You use it to shoot people
you want to kill.

16:22.071 --> 16:24.631
- All right, Jules. Here's what happened.
- "What happened"?

16:25.471 --> 16:29.071
What happened is that you humiliated me
in front of my friends and family.

16:29.271 --> 16:31.991
I've been kicked out of every
organization and club I belong to.

16:32.071 --> 16:34.671
My own magazine has taken me
off the cover, and at home,

16:35.111 --> 16:37.671
I have a teenage daughter who
sooner or later will find out

16:37.791 --> 16:40.351
that her mother was a pornographer.

16:40.991 --> 16:43.511
- Let's just be reasonable here, Jules.
- I am being reasonable.

16:44.751 --> 16:50.031
In one night, you destroyed a life
I spent almost 20 years building.

16:51.551 --> 16:53.231
- So, I'm here to kill you.
- Wait!

16:57.031 --> 17:02.991
- There's no bullets.
- No. Unfortunately.

17:04.550 --> 17:05.951
But for just a second...

17:08.871 --> 17:11.830
I wanted you to feel like
your life was being taken away.

17:20.631 --> 17:23.070
Hey. I'm headed out to pick up
some Thai. You want to come?

17:23.151 --> 17:24.711
Can't; studying history.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.471
Well, you know what's on
the way to the Thai place?

17:27.991 --> 17:30.951
The apartment of a
certain ex-con I know.

17:31.191 --> 17:32.511
That's quite a sell.

17:33.431 --> 17:34.711
So, you're just not going
to see him anymore?

17:34.831 --> 17:38.071
People who don't learn from the past are
doomed to repeat it. Well, I've learned.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.711
Yeah, you've learned, but you know

17:39.791 --> 17:42.471
your great victory is going to be what,
not seeing your brother anymore?

17:42.951 --> 17:46.991
C ongratulations.
Look, I'm not even talking about like

17:47.191 --> 17:49.511
having to move in or helping him
find a job, or anything.

17:49.591 --> 17:51.911
I mean, I literally
mean happy birthday.

17:52.351 --> 17:53.791
Four syllables.

17:59.591 --> 18:00.991
Four syllables-- that's it.

18:02.751 --> 18:05.311
Or six
hey, Trey, Happy Birthday.

18:13.271 --> 18:16.951
- You just get home?
- Yeah. I sent Seth out for Thai.

18:17.271 --> 18:20.511
Oh, perfect. Did Carter tell you
about surfing this morning?

18:21.191 --> 18:24.031
You know, he's a little rusty,
but he's definitely got some skills.

18:24.391 --> 18:27.791
Did you two manage to discuss the case
at all during your bonding session?

18:27.871 --> 18:29.271
Well, you know, a little.

18:29.351 --> 18:33.271
Oh, coming out of the water, we ran into
Erin Lee, that young orthopedist.

18:34.471 --> 18:37.231
I think there's definitely some sparks
between her and Carter.

18:37.391 --> 18:40.631
So, I was thinking we should have them
over for dinner. You know? Set them up.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.071
Wait, you're serious?

18:43.231 --> 18:46.431
Yeah. Carter's new in town.
He doesn't know that many people.

18:47.551 --> 18:50.631
- Fine, sure.
- Great. I'll make the calls.

18:57.071 --> 19:00.311
All right. Just in and out "Hey,
Happy 21st," and we're at the Thai place.

19:00.311 --> 19:01.631
This is a mistake.
He's never going to change.

19:01.631 --> 19:03.391
Dude, you've got to trust people more.

19:04.151 --> 19:05.551
- There he is.
- Great, let's go.

19:05.551 --> 19:07.071
No, wait, wait, wait.

19:08.351 --> 19:11.031
Would you relax? He's probably
just going to buy cigarettes.

19:11.991 --> 19:14.831
Or getting into that suspicious-
looking Camaro

19:15.471 --> 19:17.391
with a guy who looks like Lou Reed.

19:19.551 --> 19:21.791
All right.
I hope you like cold Thai.

19:23.391 --> 19:25.871
It's his 21st birthday. I'm sure
he's just going out for a drink.

19:28.111 --> 19:29.671
Whoa, whoa, they're stopping.
Pull over.

19:30.231 --> 19:35.031
They're probably just
picking up a friend. In a dark alley.

19:44.871 --> 19:46.431
Who he owes some money to.

20:05.231 --> 20:07.431
What's up, man?
What the hell is your problem?!

20:07.511 --> 20:09.871
You are unbelievable,
you know that? I saw you last night.

20:09.951 --> 20:11.631
- What?
- What'd you buy? Coke? Speed?

20:11.631 --> 20:14.031
- Where is it? Get rid of it right now.
- Oh, God, man.

20:14.111 --> 20:15.871
I am such an idiot,
for ever believing in you.

20:15.951 --> 20:21.391
Here. Why don't you call my parole officer,
'cause it was his car I got into last night.

20:22.871 --> 20:24.591
- What?
- Yeah, guy in the alley?

20:24.911 --> 20:27.871
That's a buddy of mine from prison who got
out a few months ago, and disappeared.

20:27.871 --> 20:30.271
I asked my P.O. to find him
because I was worried.

20:30.511 --> 20:31.111
You gave him money.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.231
He asked me for five bucks.
Am I supposed to say no?

20:33.311 --> 20:37.151
Guy's living in a trash can. God, I was
trying to convince him to go to a shelter.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.751
That's it, Ry.

20:47.431 --> 20:49.191
And, you know, it's-it's funny.

20:50.751 --> 20:53.191
'cause when I saw you,
I thought to myself,

20:54.471 --> 20:57.991
"My brother's come over to take me
out to breakfast for my birthday."

21:06.111 --> 21:10.031
You know, maybe I'm
the idiot for believing.

21:21.591 --> 21:26.271
- Hey.
- Hey, hope I'm not, um... Can I...

21:31.551 --> 21:33.991
So, I'm sorry about the other day.
I-I was out of line.

21:35.751 --> 21:38.191
He's your brother.
I should have just respected that.

21:38.351 --> 21:40.231
You didn't do anything wrong. I...

21:40.671 --> 21:43.431
was taking out
my frustration with him on you.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.591
So does that mean you're willing
to give him another chance?

21:46.711 --> 21:49.031
Well, if he's willing to give me one.

21:50.071 --> 21:53.071
Last night,
Seth and I kind of followed him.

21:53.551 --> 21:57.391
We hadn't meant to at first,
but we did. Uh...

21:58.991 --> 22:01.191
we thought we saw him
trying to buy drugs.

22:02.031 --> 22:02.871
So this morning...

22:02.951 --> 22:05.031
- You went and accused him.
- Pretty much.

22:05.511 --> 22:09.631
- And no drugs?
- He was helping out a homeless guy.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.071
Ouch.

22:12.671 --> 22:13.951
I don't know what to do.

22:15.511 --> 22:17.951
Well, as it happens, you've come
to the right place.

22:22.951 --> 22:25.191
Oh, Seth, these new pages are great.

22:25.831 --> 22:29.911
Ah, yeah. They're, you know,
sketches mostly, but thank you.

22:30.031 --> 22:32.791
Well, I owe Carter big.
You and Zach are a find.

22:33.911 --> 22:36.151
Yeah. Yeah, we're a good team.
I mean,

22:36.791 --> 22:40.111
I come up with the stories, I write
the dialogue, I draw the pages, and uh,

22:40.351 --> 22:42.151
Zach handles
the late-night coffee runs.

22:42.511 --> 22:47.031
Seriously, if you need a bone-dry cappuccino,
Zach's, he's your go-to guy, so...

22:47.151 --> 22:49.071
Where is Zach anyway?
I thought he was coming.

22:49.151 --> 22:51.911
I don't know. What is it, Saturday?
He's probably getting a haircut.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.831
You wouldn't know it, but that guy
spends copious amounts of time grooming.

22:54.831 --> 22:58.031
Let me ask you. Did you get, like,
a slight gay vibe from him at all?

22:58.111 --> 22:59.511
- What?
- Excuse me.

23:01.991 --> 23:06.031
- Hey, what's up? Girl-girl-girlfriend.
- Hey, Cohen, um, I need your help.

23:06.111 --> 23:09.231
I'm actually in a meeting
right now with... with Reed.

23:09.351 --> 23:12.111
Oh, okay. Well, uh, when you're done
with him, will you meet me at Marissa's?

23:12.191 --> 23:15.591
Oh, my God, I love these Little
Miss Vixen sketches.

23:15.911 --> 23:17.751
- Who's that?
- The waitress.

23:17.871 --> 23:19.991
Anyways, I'm gonna
call you back in a little bit.

23:20.071 --> 23:21.511
- Okay, bye.

23:22.951 --> 23:25.071
- That's my mom.
- You call your mom "girlfriend"?

23:27.951 --> 23:30.231
- Mrs. Cooper-Nichol?
- Yeah?

23:56.191 --> 23:58.231
- Hey.
- Marissa. What are you doing here?

23:58.311 --> 24:00.111
- Come on, I'm taking you out.
- What?

24:00.511 --> 24:02.671
I'm taking you out.
It's your birthday. No arguments.

24:03.151 --> 24:07.231
Okay. Okay. All right.
Let me get my keys.

24:13.391 --> 24:15.431
Afraid someone's going
to steal your beanbag?

24:15.551 --> 24:18.311
- Yeah, actually.
- Come on.

24:20.511 --> 24:23.871
I can't believe I forgot my wallet.
It'll just take a second, okay?

24:24.111 --> 24:28.311
- So where are we going to dinner?
- Well...

24:29.751 --> 24:34.231
actually, I was thinking
maybe we could eat in.

24:34.791 --> 24:37.871
Surprise.

24:40.391 --> 24:41.871
Well, happy birthday, dude.

24:42.951 --> 24:44.191
Happy Birthday.

24:47.631 --> 24:48.991
Happy Birthday.

25:00.751 --> 25:01.871
Sorry, bro.

25:02.151 --> 25:05.551
All right, we have hot dogs and
hamburgers and kielbasas for you.

25:05.711 --> 25:08.551
Cohen learned how to use the grill this
summer. It's a major life achievement.

25:08.671 --> 25:11.191
That's right. I grilled some corn.
I grilled some veggies.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.951
I found something in Marissa's fridge,
I just... I grilled it.

25:14.311 --> 25:15.431
Sounds great.

25:16.231 --> 25:19.511
Marissa, I have to go out for a bit.
Can I trust you while I'm gone?

25:19.591 --> 25:20.671
Yes, Mom.

25:21.031 --> 25:23.671
It's only going to be us, and maybe
a couple girls from the charity league.

25:23.751 --> 25:26.471
Well, I don't want to come home
and find I'm living in Delta house.

25:27.351 --> 25:29.631
- Is that Ryan's brother?
- Yeah.

25:29.791 --> 25:33.231
Okay. Well, since he's 21, I gues
it'd be okay if he had a beer.

25:33.351 --> 25:38.071
But just one. See, I can be
a cool mom, too. Bye, honey.

25:42.071 --> 25:43.711
One weekend we should
drive down to Swami's.

25:43.751 --> 25:45.591
It's a little crowded,
but it's got a killer ride.

25:45.591 --> 25:47.031
Count me in.

25:47.311 --> 25:50.311
- Hey, Kirsten.
- Hey, Carter. You look nice.

25:50.431 --> 25:52.671
Oh, thanks. Sandy told me
to spiff it up a bit.

25:52.791 --> 25:54.751
Yeah, I didn't want him
to embarrass us.

25:56.311 --> 25:57.551
That must be Erin.

26:00.551 --> 26:03.271
I... I hope this isn't...
strange, or...

26:03.351 --> 26:05.791
No, it's not. It's fun.

26:05.911 --> 26:08.391
Yeah, because, this,
it wasn't my, uh... I didn't...

26:09.151 --> 26:12.431
- Carter? You remember Erin?
- Yes, I do. Hi.

26:12.591 --> 26:13.591
My wife, Kirsten.

26:13.671 --> 26:14.871
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

26:14.951 --> 26:17.071
I was just saying to Carter we should
go down to Swami's some weekend.

26:17.071 --> 26:19.431
- What do you think?
- Sure, I'd love to.

26:20.431 --> 26:23.311
Guys, come on outside. The best thing
about this place are the sunsets.

26:23.311 --> 26:24.551
Lead the way.

26:24.991 --> 26:27.071
You all go. I'll bring the wine.

26:43.551 --> 26:44.671
Hey, Jules. Thanks for coming.

26:44.791 --> 26:46.711
Just tell me what I'm doing here, hmm?

26:46.911 --> 26:49.471
"If you want the rest, meet me"?
What do you expect to get, Lance?

26:49.471 --> 26:51.711
- My life is already ruined.
- Look, I don't want anything.

26:52.631 --> 26:54.751
Here. It's the rest of the tapes.

26:55.231 --> 26:58.871
Look, just yesterday I got
offered $8,500 for them, but I said no.

26:59.191 --> 27:00.071
What a gentleman.

27:00.151 --> 27:03.311
So you want points for turning down eight
grand, after fleecing Caleb for $500,000?

27:03.431 --> 27:05.951
- I didn't get a penny out of Caleb.
- What are you talking about?

27:05.951 --> 27:10.151
Yeah, after he got the master tape, he had
me beaten up and threatened a lot worse.

27:12.111 --> 27:13.471
But I guess he didn't tell you that.

27:14.911 --> 27:15.911
No.

27:17.751 --> 27:19.391
I thought he would just pay up.

27:19.631 --> 27:21.391
You know, to protect his wife and all.

27:22.351 --> 27:25.311
But I guess a guy like Caleb Nichol
doesn't mind taking chances.

27:26.391 --> 27:28.791
Yeah, when it's my
reputation he's gambling.

27:28.991 --> 27:32.591
Jules, I never meant to hurt you.
Honestly.

27:33.231 --> 27:34.711
But after he did that...

27:35.631 --> 27:39.231
well, you know what I'm like
when I think I'm being cheated.

27:40.351 --> 27:40.951
Yeah, I remember.

27:40.951 --> 27:43.151
Look, if I had the money now,
I would give it to you.

27:43.231 --> 27:48.351
Every cent. But I don't.
I got nothing.

27:49.351 --> 27:51.111
Not even the $8,500.

27:56.311 --> 27:58.031
Got enough to buy me a drink?

28:00.511 --> 28:02.911
Huh? So, uh, how many people would
you say you invited?

28:03.191 --> 28:04.551
- Four.
- Me, too.

28:04.631 --> 28:06.271
I don't even know four other people.

28:06.991 --> 28:10.631
- Looks like word spread.
- Yeah.

28:11.551 --> 28:15.991
- Hey, check out Zach and that hottie.
- Hey. That's, um...

28:19.391 --> 28:20.351
...a very attractive woman.

28:20.431 --> 28:23.591
She looks a little older, don't you think?
Like maybe she's in college?

28:23.671 --> 28:24.831
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

28:24.831 --> 28:25.831
Yeah, maybe he'll bring her out here.

28:25.831 --> 28:28.911
I think I see somebody doing magic
by the pool. Let's go check that out.

28:29.031 --> 28:31.751
Magic tricks, huh?
Definitely somebody you invited.

28:34.191 --> 28:35.671
This is fine. You won't get in
trouble for this, right?

28:35.751 --> 28:38.071
Yeah, it's not like
I'm throwing a rager.

28:43.871 --> 28:46.751
- Is there a party here?
- Uh, yeah.

28:46.951 --> 28:52.111
This is it! Come on!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Party!

28:56.631 --> 28:58.911
- I think the word has spread.
- Yeah.

29:33.344 --> 29:37.104
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt
your drinking. I'm looking for, uh, Zach.

29:37.344 --> 29:39.664
- He plays water polo, too.
- Are you talking to me, geek?

29:40.664 --> 29:44.064
Oh, uh, I think, you know, the kicking
the comic book guy's ass

29:44.104 --> 29:47.744
we're probably past it. Oh, your hand goes
all the way around. Kind of hard to breathe.

29:52.944 --> 29:54.864
What the hell?
Hey, calm down. Stop it, man. Stop it!

29:55.144 --> 29:56.464
I got a game tomorrow.

29:56.464 --> 30:00.664
Yeah? Then I suggest you go home
and get some sleep.

30:07.344 --> 30:10.784
- You okay?
- Thanks, dude. It's déjà vu.

30:11.224 --> 30:14.944
O.C. party, attacked by water polo guys,
saved by an Atwood. Hello.

30:14.944 --> 30:18.304
That was amazing.
Do you, like, know aikido or something?

30:20.544 --> 30:22.184
Okay, I'll just go.

30:22.384 --> 30:25.224
- I'm Jess.
- Uh, Trey. Nice tat.

30:25.824 --> 30:29.624
- Thanks. It's a Buddha smoking a joint.
- That's very artistic.

30:29.904 --> 30:32.944
I'd show you the rest, but
my boyfriend's probably watching.

30:34.824 --> 30:37.184
- We can go somewhere else.
- Sure.

30:42.944 --> 30:43.864
Hey, dude.

30:44.064 --> 30:46.504
- You want to explain yourself, maybe?
- What are you talking about?

30:46.504 --> 30:49.784
Dude, Reed. Remember the whole
professional ethics conversation we had?

30:49.784 --> 30:52.144
Oh, yeah, like not letting me know
there was a meeting?

30:52.584 --> 30:55.624
First of all, you were the guy. You're like,
"I have a laundry list of things to do."

30:55.624 --> 30:58.104
- You telling her I'm gay?
- Now, I said gay vibe.

30:58.104 --> 31:01.184
I distinctly remember saying gay vibe,
and the two are very different.

31:01.184 --> 31:03.824
Okay, then how about me
getting you cappuccinos?

31:04.144 --> 31:05.824
Bone dry? What does...
what does that even mean?

31:05.824 --> 31:07.624
God, what is she, a court reporter?

31:08.624 --> 31:10.344
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

31:10.824 --> 31:12.344
Look, okay?

31:12.944 --> 31:14.744
I don't really want to get
into this right now, okay,

31:14.744 --> 31:16.624
so you just look for your date,
and I'll look for mine.

31:16.624 --> 31:17.544
Fine.

31:30.424 --> 31:32.304
Finally, somewhere private.

31:33.864 --> 31:36.184
- You don't go to Harbor, do you?
- No. I just moved here.

31:36.664 --> 31:38.304
- From where?
- Prison.

31:41.544 --> 31:46.384
- Did you kill someone?
- No. I stole a car.

31:46.704 --> 31:48.784
So, what's a car thief doing
at a Newport rager?

31:48.864 --> 31:53.264
Well, actually...
this is my birthday party.

31:53.704 --> 31:55.664
Well, convict...

32:02.464 --> 32:04.344
Time to open your present.

32:17.584 --> 32:20.344
Oh, my gosh, no, but what was
the name of that other guy?

32:20.584 --> 32:23.424
- Dwight.
- Oh, no. Oh. Dwight.

32:23.744 --> 32:26.984
No, he-he had that birthmark. Oh.
No, I'm talking about the one...

32:27.104 --> 32:29.984
the one who always said, oh, oh,
what was it? Oh, "bottom line".

32:30.064 --> 32:31.464
Oh, my God. Everything was
"bottom line".

32:31.464 --> 32:34.504
Like, yeah, "Vegas, bottom
line, you're going to get screwed."

32:35.664 --> 32:37.704
Or he'd say,
"Bottom line, I'm..."

32:38.224 --> 32:40.664
- What?
- Oh, my God.

32:40.744 --> 32:43.024
- What?
- Do you remember this concert?

32:43.144 --> 32:46.544
- Yeah. Threw your shirt at the band.
- No, no, no, that was the Ratt concert.

32:46.664 --> 32:48.344
Uh, you went through a lot of shirts.

32:54.864 --> 32:58.144
- This was actually pretty fun, but, um...
- Hold on. Don't go yet.

32:58.664 --> 33:05.624
- One more drink... for Whitesnake.
- For Whitesnake.

33:05.704 --> 33:08.184
- Yes!
- Bring it on.

33:21.824 --> 33:22.784
Sorry.

33:23.064 --> 33:25.824
Oh, no, come in. There are already a
couple people in the shower already.

33:26.544 --> 33:27.464
Wonderful.

33:33.744 --> 33:36.624
- Aren't you here with Zach?
- Yeah, I mean, just as friends.

33:36.944 --> 33:41.944
- He's a great guy, isn't he?
- Oh, my God, so sweet and cute.

33:42.104 --> 33:43.624
I can't believe he doesn't
have a girlfriend.

33:43.704 --> 33:46.264
Well, some girls at our school
can be idiots.

33:47.424 --> 33:51.584
I know this sounds crazy, but, uh, have
you ever heard of Little Miss Vixen?

33:52.464 --> 33:55.904
Yeah, um... how do you know about
Little Miss Vixen? Do you know Seth?

33:55.904 --> 34:00.944
Yeah. I'm working with him
on his comic book. I'm Reed.

34:01.424 --> 34:03.424
You ass! He's a she!

34:03.424 --> 34:05.744
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Reed's a girl!

34:06.024 --> 34:07.464
Okay, I-I never said...

34:07.544 --> 34:09.864
Don't you dare! Don't even pretend
that you didn't lie.

34:09.864 --> 34:11.664
I just... I knew you would get
the wrong idea.

34:11.664 --> 34:13.184
Oh, right, this is my fault,

34:13.304 --> 34:17.504
because, of course, I wouldn't want to know
that my boyfriend met some gorgeous 23-year-old

34:17.504 --> 34:20.984
who loves comics and thinks he's the next
Brian Bendis, whatever that means.

34:21.143 --> 34:23.024
She said that she thinks
I'm the next Bendis?

34:23.984 --> 34:25.344
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

34:27.464 --> 34:29.464
Summer, look, I'm sorry.
I should've told you, okay?

34:29.583 --> 34:30.424
Zach!

34:30.784 --> 34:33.103
- Zach, hey, are you leaving?
- Yeah.

34:33.143 --> 34:35.984
- Can I get a ride?
- Um... yeah.

34:39.824 --> 34:40.704
Summer, please.

34:40.704 --> 34:44.384
Cohen, just shut up, 'cause even
when you're not lying, you're lying.

34:48.984 --> 34:59.864
<i>Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn</i>

35:01.144 --> 35:07.864
<i>Just like every cowboy sings
a sad, sad song</i>

35:08.544 --> 35:12.664
<i>Every rose has its thorn. </i>

35:14.464 --> 35:16.984
- Poison rocked.
- They did, they did.

35:18.864 --> 35:20.864
Oh, baby, I think it's
time to get you home.

35:21.064 --> 35:27.544
Oh, yeah, home. Great. Home, yeah.
Caleb's going to divorce me.

35:27.664 --> 35:28.344
Jules...

35:28.344 --> 35:31.344
No, you know, he said he didn't
judge me about the whole...

35:32.304 --> 35:38.784
you know, but... all during this trip,
he didn't even look at me. I mean,

35:38.984 --> 35:42.824
and when he did, I could see it
in his eyes. He was... disgusted.

35:42.824 --> 35:43.984
That's not true.

35:44.424 --> 35:46.904
That's why I came home early.
I couldn't take it anymore.

35:47.704 --> 35:50.544
So, yeah, uh, he'll divorce me.

35:50.984 --> 35:56.744
I'll have no money, no career, no friends,
nothing... for me and my girls.

35:59.144 --> 36:01.224
What if something was
to happen to Caleb?

36:02.824 --> 36:03.744
What do you mean?

36:04.944 --> 36:08.264
19 years ago, when you left me for
that guy, Cooper,

36:09.384 --> 36:11.984
my life just felt like
it stopped, you know?

36:12.984 --> 36:17.144
But seeing you again...
I feel like I'm finally waking up.

36:18.984 --> 36:21.424
- It feels good.
- Lance...

36:21.464 --> 36:24.864
No. What's happening
to you is my fault...

36:26.064 --> 36:29.984
so if getting rid of Caleb means you and
your daughters will be taken care of...

36:31.544 --> 36:32.944
I'll do it.

36:51.784 --> 36:52.984
Looking good, man.

36:55.264 --> 36:58.824
Hey! There you are.
And you're drinking water.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.704
Someone's got to be responsible.

37:06.144 --> 37:07.824
Oh, okay, that's it.

37:09.624 --> 37:11.624
I don't even want
to deal with this.

37:12.144 --> 37:15.904
Excuse me. This is my room.

37:15.944 --> 37:19.824
- Oh. You want in?
- Get out.

37:24.864 --> 37:25.744
Dude...

37:26.544 --> 37:28.984
Your mom would understand, don't
you think, if she came home right now?

37:29.104 --> 37:30.504
Oh, definitely.

37:31.064 --> 37:33.104
I mean, she did say
Trey could have a beer.

37:36.464 --> 37:38.704
All right, listen.

37:39.304 --> 37:41.224
Thank you for everything
you've done for Trey.

37:42.944 --> 37:52.464
If it wasn't for you,
he and I... You've been amazing.

37:56.384 --> 37:59.904
I know what it's like to have someone
believe in you when no one else does.

38:15.984 --> 38:17.504
Oh, my God.

38:23.584 --> 38:24.664
- Who is it?!
- I don't know.

38:24.664 --> 38:26.384
- Is she breathing?
- I don't know.

38:26.384 --> 38:28.784
Get her out. Get her out.

38:36.624 --> 38:38.384
Oh, I remember that article you
wrote in Revolutions

38:38.384 --> 38:40.344
about those corporate heads
that cheated the stockholders.

38:40.464 --> 38:41.784
I got sued for that one, too.

38:41.784 --> 38:44.384
Yeah, but you were right.
Now look at Tyco and Enron.

38:44.384 --> 38:46.224
Man, you were years
ahead of everyone else.

38:46.304 --> 38:47.544
Still got sued.

38:47.904 --> 38:50.144
You ever think about
holding back, playing it safe?

38:50.264 --> 38:53.424
You know, at the risk
of sounding... pompous,

38:54.904 --> 38:57.024
if you're not going to tell
the truth, what's the point?

38:58.144 --> 38:59.624
Just a minute. Excuse me.

39:00.584 --> 39:04.144
- Kirsten, dinner was... dinner was great.
- Oh, thank you.

39:04.384 --> 39:05.944
I'm glad you both could make it.

39:08.104 --> 39:10.344
- I'll be right there.
- What is it?

39:10.344 --> 39:12.144
Apparently, the kids threw
a party for Trey,

39:12.144 --> 39:15.744
and it got a little out of hand. Some girl
took drugs. She passed out in the pool.

39:15.744 --> 39:16.664
Are Seth and Ryan okay?

39:16.744 --> 39:19.584
All the kids are okay, but I-I... I got
to get over there. I-I'm so sorry.

39:19.584 --> 39:21.944
No, no, it's fine.
Oh, I should move my, uh, car.

39:21.984 --> 39:22.984
Thank you.

39:23.744 --> 39:25.304
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

39:27.944 --> 39:31.224
- Well, uh...
- Here, let me help you.

39:32.144 --> 39:33.984
I'm so sorry things had to end this way.

39:34.104 --> 39:36.224
I know. I had a great time.

39:37.624 --> 39:43.184
- Carter seems really wonderful.
- He is. Just... be careful.

39:43.704 --> 39:44.464
What do you mean?

39:47.464 --> 39:51.984
- This divorce was really hard on him.
- He's divorced...

39:53.024 --> 39:56.104
- and not over her yet, right?
- Well, I think he is.

39:56.304 --> 39:58.784
It's just that the wounds are still raw.

40:01.384 --> 40:04.944
But he's a great guy.
I-I-I just thought you should know.

40:05.944 --> 40:09.344
No, I... I appreciate it. Thank you.

40:17.064 --> 40:18.544
- She going to be okay?
- Stand back.

40:19.424 --> 40:20.984
Hey, what's going on?

40:21.424 --> 40:25.424
- Where you been?
- I, uh...

40:25.904 --> 40:27.264
What, you know her?

40:27.344 --> 40:30.224
Seth, Ryan, everybody okay?

40:31.224 --> 40:33.064
- What about the girl?
- We don't know.

40:33.104 --> 40:35.624
- Do you live here?
- No. Uh, my name's Sandy Cohen.

40:35.704 --> 40:37.384
I'm responsible for these four.

40:37.624 --> 40:38.864
- Who lives here?
- I do.

40:38.864 --> 40:39.624
Where's your parents?

40:39.624 --> 40:42.024
My mom's out-- I tried her cell,
but she's not answering.

40:42.024 --> 40:44.264
Okay, you're going to have to turn
around, miss. Gonna have to take you in.

40:44.344 --> 40:46.424
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, officer, what are you doing?

40:46.504 --> 40:50.024
Sir, we found a bag of ecstasy, and I'm
betting that somebody gave it to that girl.

40:50.224 --> 40:53.664
Till I find out who supplied the drugs,
I'm arresting the owner of the house.

40:56.104 --> 40:59.024
I gave 'em to her.
I brought the drugs.

40:59.544 --> 41:02.504
- Trey...
- Sorry

41:03.784 --> 41:05.184
Well, keep your mouth shut.

41:05.264 --> 41:07.224
I'll meet you in jail.
Officer, I'm his lawyer.

41:07.224 --> 41:08.864
You have the right to remain silent.

41:08.984 --> 41:11.264
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

41:11.264 --> 41:13.584
You have the right to an attorney
before questioning-- do you understand?

41:14.224 --> 41:15.784
Yeah.
