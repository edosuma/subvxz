00:18.535 --> 00:21.538
she said

00:21.538 --> 00:24.541
you've got to burn
to shine

00:24.541 --> 00:26.543

born under a bad sign

00:26.543 --> 00:30.046

in your eyes

00:30.547 --> 00:32.048
when you woke up
this mornin'

00:32.549 --> 00:35.051
all that love had gone

00:35.418 --> 00:39.806

about right and wrong

00:40.173 --> 00:43.059

Yeah

01:02.579 --> 01:04.697

01:05.197 --> 01:07.200
the world turned
upside down

01:07.333 --> 01:09.335
lord above, things ain't
been the same

01:09.586 --> 01:13.206

01:13.456 --> 01:17.210
but you're, but you're
one in a million'cause you

01:17.710 --> 01:21.097

Come on, come on, come on.

01:41.484 --> 01:43.987
Come on, come on, come on.

01:43.987 --> 01:45.989
Go get it.
Look at this.

01:46.489 --> 01:49.993
Look at this plastic.
And there's weeds.

01:49.993 --> 01:52.495
It looks like
tobacco road.

01:52.629 --> 01:55.131
Nobody gets down here.
Anthony!

01:55.131 --> 01:58.134
Those dogs are wild dogs.

01:58.134 --> 02:02.138
Cemetery dogs.
They'll take your hand off.

02:02.138 --> 02:04.140
Come over here.

02:04.140 --> 02:07.644
Say a hail mary
for your grandfather.
Lay off. He's a kid.

02:07.644 --> 02:12.015
So he should
neglect his elders?
Just like his father.

02:12.015 --> 02:15.018
Yeah, real scamp.
Yeah, my son,

02:15.018 --> 02:17.020
the mental patient.

02:17.020 --> 02:19.022
Remember those trips
to the shore?

02:19.272 --> 02:21.274
Me and tony used to
ride the waves?

02:21.274 --> 02:25.778
- I taught him how to bodysurf.
- My son was brought up right.

02:25.778 --> 02:28.281
He needs a psychiatrist
for what?

02:28.781 --> 02:30.783
To talk about his sex life?
Enough.

02:30.783 --> 02:33.786
I hate it
as much as you do.
Anthony!

02:33.786 --> 02:37.290
Those dogs could start
foaming at the mouth.

02:37.674 --> 02:41.177
Hey, grandma. How come
youse not supposed to
breathe in the cemetery?

02:41.427 --> 02:44.180
Who says?
It's a joke, for christ's sake.
Say "why?"

02:44.180 --> 02:46.683
'Cause you'll make
the dead people jealous.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.806
Pick it up! Pick it up!
Who's got the ball?

02:53.940 --> 02:56.693
- Who's got the ball?
- Oh, my god.
Meadow, look out!

02:56.693 --> 02:59.562
Come around, come around!

02:59.562 --> 03:01.564
Up, up, up!
Cover'em through!

03:02.065 --> 03:04.200
- I can't watch.
- Yes!

03:04.317 --> 03:06.953
- Atta girl, meadow!

03:06.953 --> 03:08.955
You're a brick wall, baby!
Brick wall!

03:09.322 --> 03:11.958
Good save! Come on, now!
Come on!

03:12.075 --> 03:14.077
That was close.

03:14.077 --> 03:17.580
Pretty good.
Look at you
at girl's soccer, tony.

03:17.580 --> 03:20.583
What do you want from me?
My only son's a couch potato.

03:20.717 --> 03:23.219
- Red, five!
- What are you,
yellow card happy?

03:23.336 --> 03:24.837
Rough play, my ass!

Oh, come on!

03:27.974 --> 03:30.593
Hi, honey.

03:30.593 --> 03:34.097
This fat kid is such a sneak
with that elbow!

03:34.097 --> 03:37.600
Coach says next year
chiara is gonna be
one of his stars.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.603
Come on, falcons! Let's
pull it out, for christ sake!
Heather dante!

03:40.853 --> 03:45.858
- A hundred bucks for a goal!
- What's with ally today?
She's sleepwalkin' out there.

03:48.494 --> 03:50.496
She eats at our house
three nights a week.
I know she's got the energy.

03:50.997 --> 03:54.000
That tackle was all ball,
asshole!

03:54.500 --> 03:57.253
Yeah, zebra,

03:57.370 --> 03:59.372
You blow that whistle

I'm goin'.

You're a hell of a guy.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.641
Falcons!
Falcons, heads up!

04:19.024 --> 04:23.029

Did i tell you?

04:57.430 --> 05:00.933
He's a brilliant coach.
He's a beautiful,
brilliant genius.

05:00.933 --> 05:03.936
Yeah. You in love
with him or what?
Frankly, yes.

05:03.936 --> 05:07.440
If he steers chiara through
to a college scholarship,
i'll blow the guy at midfield.

05:07.690 --> 05:10.693
Oh, you will?

05:10.693 --> 05:13.196
How's cheffing at dimples?

05:13.196 --> 05:16.199
You gotta come sample
the salad bar. We got
a special chemical brightener.

05:16.199 --> 05:18.201
Keeps the lettuce crisp.
How nice.

05:18.201 --> 05:20.703
Oh, yeah.
It's beautiful.
The offer's still there.

05:20.703 --> 05:23.206
You wanna make a little money,
you put some out on the street,

05:23.206 --> 05:25.708
at two points,
we split the interest.

05:25.708 --> 05:28.211
Nice.

05:28.711 --> 05:32.715
I can't do the math,
ton'. I'm an artiste.

05:32.715 --> 05:35.718
Get outta here.

05:35.718 --> 05:37.720
Good job, girls!

05:48.481 --> 05:50.983
Absolutely, yeah.
You do that so well, coach.

05:51.484 --> 05:54.987
Thank you.
You did a hell of a job,
coach.

05:55.121 --> 05:57.123
Welcome to the bada bing.
Everything's on the house.

05:57.123 --> 06:00.126
Brandy! Come here!
I want you to meet somebody.

06:00.126 --> 06:02.128
- This guy coached college.
- Get outta here.

06:02.628 --> 06:06.132
Division 1- a!
Nay, that's boonie state.

06:06.132 --> 06:09.635
Besides, art, the time
has come to stop moving
my wife and deena...

06:09.635 --> 06:11.637
like pawns every time
somebody ups the ante.

06:11.637 --> 06:16.142
Anyway, now many chances
does a man get to coach
his own daughter?

06:16.142 --> 06:18.644
What do they say?
"Money isn't everything."
Hear, hear.

06:18.644 --> 06:21.647
- It's the kids
that are important.
- Cheers to the falcons.

06:21.647 --> 06:23.649
Continued success.

06:28.154 --> 06:31.657
Brandy, why don't you give
the coach a deluxe tour
of the vip lounge?

06:32.658 --> 06:35.161
What?
Oh, guys.

06:35.161 --> 06:37.663
Jesus,
we said a beer.

06:37.663 --> 06:42.168
Oh, whoa-- no, i--
uh, thank you, but
i don't think so.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.671
Aw, jesus christ.

06:45.671 --> 06:49.675
Okay, brandy, go, uh,
sit on a tuffet.

06:49.675 --> 06:52.178
Coach,
it's on the house.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.799
- What the fuck are you
doin' here?
- Who's he?

06:56.799 --> 06:58.801
My girl's soccer coach.
You got somethin' for me?

06:58.801 --> 07:01.804
For one thing, every car you see
in your rearview mirror
is not a fed.

07:01.804 --> 07:04.807
Mikey palmice went out
and got a major manhattan p. I.

07:04.807 --> 07:07.810
Mikey palmice thinks
someone here is rattin'
for the government.

07:07.810 --> 07:10.313
What else is new?
What else?

07:10.313 --> 07:13.816
My colleague over at
organized crime task force...

07:13.816 --> 07:18.321
gets chatty after, uh,
caffeine drinks.

07:18.321 --> 07:22.825
Names of people
whose fiscal interests
intersect with your own.

07:22.825 --> 07:26.329
Shit.
I'm still trying to find out
if you've been named.

07:26.829 --> 07:30.833
But these people, they are
keeping these indictments
very, very internal, tony.

07:30.833 --> 07:33.336
For all i know, they got
a folder withmyname on it,

07:33.336 --> 07:35.338
and if i was smart,
i wouldn't be here.

07:35.721 --> 07:39.225
I rest my case.
As it is, i'm up the street
on a rape/homicide.

07:39.225 --> 07:43.229
What i need now, is to see
a liquor license, sir,
if you don't mind.

07:43.229 --> 07:47.233
So anybody wonders
why i was here, or
for the lie detector test--

07:47.233 --> 07:52.738
cha- cha, show him
the liquor license.
Don't touch the girls.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.241
How you doin'?

07:55.241 --> 07:57.243
Bada bing. Arthur bucco!

07:57.243 --> 07:59.245
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:02.248 --> 08:05.868
- Hello?
- What, you gonna stay
in that bar all day?

08:06.002 --> 08:09.005
I'm shootin'
a little pool.
I'll rack'em up for you.

08:09.005 --> 08:12.008
I thought we were supposed
to be painting the trim
on the patio.

08:12.508 --> 08:14.510
I bought the primer
and i've been scraping.

08:14.627 --> 08:18.130
- You have.
- Arthur, i could really
use your help.

08:18.514 --> 08:20.766
All right. Sure.
Honey, i'll be right home.

08:24.136 --> 08:26.639
This fuckin' guy lays down
the law, ton'.

08:26.639 --> 08:29.141
Fuckin' blisterin'.
I'll be right home, honey.

08:29.141 --> 08:32.144
I've gotta be
getting home too.
Shelly'll be looking for me.

08:32.144 --> 08:34.647
It's quite the lifestyle
you got here, though.

08:34.647 --> 08:36.649
See you later,
coach.
Okay.

08:36.649 --> 08:39.150
Different strokes.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.789
Melvoin, frolov, schneider
and archide.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.791
I'm sorry.
He's in a meeting.
Can i take a message?

08:46.292 --> 08:47.793
What's goin' on with the feds
and their fuckin' indictment?

08:48.294 --> 08:50.296
Just put it
right down there.

08:50.296 --> 08:54.300
Here's the bill.
The book is off
from the 14th ward.

08:54.417 --> 08:57.303
I don't wanna minimize
your position, corrado.

08:57.303 --> 09:00.306
Two prior convictions.
That places you in jeopardy
of sentence...

09:00.306 --> 09:02.308
under the
habitual offenders statute.

09:02.675 --> 09:05.678
I'm payin' you four an hour
to hear shit that's already
eatin' my insides?

09:06.178 --> 09:08.180
Who had the peppers
and eggs?
Over here.

09:08.431 --> 09:10.566
That's what i should've had.

09:15.571 --> 09:18.074
I'd be happy
to surrender mr. Soprano?

09:18.574 --> 09:21.077
You can be assured
of my full cooperation?

09:21.577 --> 09:24.447
You'd rather they kicked in
your front door
in the middle of the night?

09:24.830 --> 09:26.949
It's a target letter,
corrado.

09:26.949 --> 09:30.202
I wasn't getting anywhere,
so i asked them point blank
what your status was.

09:31.954 --> 09:34.590
Just testing. That's what
a good lawyer would do.

09:34.590 --> 09:38.210
- They'd let me know
when it was appropriate.
- I may just start paying taxes.

09:38.461 --> 09:40.596
- Fuckin' funny. -

09:40.596 --> 09:43.349
i'm sick and tired
of sittin' around here
on my hands.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.851
I'm gonna get outta here.
Down to boca
with your lady friend?

09:45.968 --> 09:50.222
- What the fuck you know?
- Works for the joint fitters
union, didn't somebody say?

09:50.356 --> 09:54.610
Runs their, uh,
labor management fund
outside the fed's oversight.

09:56.612 --> 09:59.615
If you can't get
your friends jobs, what's the
purpose of attaining success?

10:00.116 --> 10:02.118
The wheels of justice
turn slowly.

10:02.368 --> 10:05.371
Take her to florida.
Develop a tan.

10:05.871 --> 10:09.625
- Where's the key
to the partners' crapper?
- Top right- hand drawer.

10:09.625 --> 10:13.629
Junior, we're working out of
our fuckin' lawyer's office.

10:13.629 --> 10:15.631
Is that right?

10:15.631 --> 10:19.635
I didn't want to say anything,
but this government's case?

10:19.635 --> 10:22.138
If there's a leak,
it's in tony's boat.

10:22.638 --> 10:24.640
You wanna tell me...

10:24.640 --> 10:27.643
my nephew's in bed with
the justice department,
just say it.

10:27.643 --> 10:29.645
Don't stammer around
like a fuckin' spastic.

10:29.645 --> 10:32.148
There's something
fucking wrong with that guy.

10:32.148 --> 10:36.652
I feel it in my gut.
I'm worried about you,
skipper.

10:36.652 --> 10:40.156
I'm sorry, mikey.
You're a good boy.

10:40.656 --> 10:42.608
Fuck this.
I'm goin' to boca.

10:44.327 --> 10:46.829
Deena, when you guys showed up
to verbum dei last year,

10:46.829 --> 10:49.332
i thought,"soccer.
Give me a break."

10:49.332 --> 10:53.836
But your dad makes it seem
like this, i don't know,
metaphor.

10:53.836 --> 10:55.838
Yeah.
Yeah, dad's pretty cool.

10:55.838 --> 10:58.841
You guys, where's al?
She was supposed to
loan me a cig.

10:58.841 --> 11:01.344
I'll come with.

11:01.344 --> 11:03.846
Al?
Ally!

11:05.348 --> 11:07.850
Al!

11:07.850 --> 11:12.355
If you're smoking,
you owe me five dollars!

11:12.355 --> 11:14.357
Al?
Ally?

11:17.360 --> 11:20.229
Ally?

11:20.229 --> 11:23.232
- Ally, what are you doing?
- Ally!

11:23.366 --> 11:25.368
Oh, my god! Ally!
Ally! Oh, my god!

11:29.372 --> 11:32.625
Her parents split up.
That's why she spends
all her time at our house.

11:33.125 --> 11:34.627
But the kid was born
with a silver spoon.

11:35.127 --> 11:37.129
Teenage girls are
under a lot of stress.

11:37.129 --> 11:40.132
I know this kid.
She's great.

11:40.132 --> 11:44.637
Was it a genuine
suicide attempt, or was
it a suicidal gesture?

11:45.638 --> 11:48.140
"Small cutting"
is the clinical term.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.142
What's "large cutting"?
O. J. In the missing tracksuit?

11:50.643 --> 11:53.145
It's a cry for help.

11:53.145 --> 11:55.147
Ah.

11:55.147 --> 11:59.151
Her mother says she...
tried this before.

11:59.151 --> 12:02.655
A couple times.

12:03.155 --> 12:05.157
What else is going on
in your life?

12:05.274 --> 12:07.276
Life is putting
the prozac to the test.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.662
It's all that business that
keeps popping up in the news?

12:10.162 --> 12:12.665
I'd rather talk about
my daughter.

12:12.665 --> 12:15.167
Principal says girls in sports,
they do better.

12:15.668 --> 12:18.671
They don't take the drugs,
they don't get knocked up.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.673
But now this shit.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.676
If my daughter ever tried
to kill herself--

12:27.046 --> 12:29.048
oh, god!

12:38.557 --> 12:40.559
Last week
i called you a whore.

12:40.559 --> 12:44.063
I might've been...

12:44.063 --> 12:46.565
overstatin' the case
a little bit.

12:53.205 --> 12:55.207
Oo- hoo.
Mr. Soprano.

12:55.207 --> 12:58.577
Miss sanfillipo.
I have a check here
for you to sign.

12:59.578 --> 13:03.082
Twenty grand.
For research
and development...

13:03.082 --> 13:05.468
into furthering
the art and science...

13:05.468 --> 13:08.471
of metal and ceramic
joint fitting.

13:08.587 --> 13:10.723
Where does our research
and development
take us this time?

13:11.223 --> 13:13.225
I was thinking
boca raton.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.979
My, my.
You read my mind.
I'm all packed, baby.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.098
I gotta talk to my cousin.

13:19.098 --> 13:22.101
Uh, mr. Soprano?
What?

13:22.101 --> 13:26.105
I was waitin' to talk to jerry
about how i could use some, uh,
wiggle room...

13:26.238 --> 13:28.741
on this mall job i got
in north bergen.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.493
Then i saw you here.
And i thought,

13:30.493 --> 13:34.497
"what the hell?
I may as well
ask the man himself."

13:34.497 --> 13:36.499
Let's you and i meet.

13:36.499 --> 13:39.001
I can pass my recommends
onto my cousin.

13:42.505 --> 13:46.509
Hey, mama livia, how are you?
Do you remember me,
larry boy barese?

13:46.509 --> 13:49.011
Well, i know
who you are!

13:49.011 --> 13:53.015
You lit an apartment house
on fire...

13:53.015 --> 13:55.518
and scared your mother
half to death.

13:56.018 --> 13:58.637
Mama's moving in here
on the fifteenth.

13:59.138 --> 14:01.140
I like your shoes,
larry boy.

14:01.390 --> 14:04.894
Mama hasn't been well in
her mind. Last week she threw
a jar of artichokes at me.

14:05.394 --> 14:07.897
She better not throw
any artichokes at me!

14:07.897 --> 14:10.399
Ma, how you doin'?

14:10.399 --> 14:12.902
- Remember larry?
- Water under the bridge.

14:12.902 --> 14:15.404
Yeah. We're gonna take a walk.
We'll be right back.

14:15.404 --> 14:17.406
You should get some shoes
like his.

14:18.908 --> 14:21.410
I'll tell you somethin',
tony. You've always been
a fuckin' genius.

14:21.410 --> 14:23.913
But this last move is
the best move you ever did.

14:23.913 --> 14:26.415
The feds are never gonna
surveil an old folks home.

14:26.415 --> 14:30.419
That's why i got six truckloads
of bootleg polident comin' in.

14:30.419 --> 14:32.421
Hey, jimmy.
How you doin'?
There he is.

14:32.421 --> 14:34.807
Did you get your mother
settled into a suite?

14:35.307 --> 14:36.809
They're not sure they're
gonna accept her.

14:37.309 --> 14:38.811
They wanna see my
financial statement again.

14:39.311 --> 14:41.814
So this office supply chain
comin' up from virginia.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.066
What's the deal on them?
I spoke to them.

14:44.066 --> 14:47.570
I think they're gonna listen
to reason on minority hiring.

14:49.438 --> 14:52.074
You been to games?
What've they got?

15:02.952 --> 15:04.954
What the fuck?

15:05.337 --> 15:09.842
Hup! Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup!

15:09.842 --> 15:13.345
Knees high, colgiavani!
Eyes ahead!

15:13.345 --> 15:15.347
Energy, girls, energy!

15:15.848 --> 15:19.852
I know we're all upset about
all that's been going on, but
we still have a season left!

15:19.852 --> 15:22.354
Come on!
Let's go!
Hey, coach.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.857
Hey, fellas. Uh, sorry,
but practice is closed today.

15:25.357 --> 15:27.860
I'm trying to
keep the team focused.
What're you doin'?

15:29.478 --> 15:33.232
You're leavin' us?
After two fuckin' years?

15:33.232 --> 15:36.735
I told that reporter
to wait until after sectionals
before he put that in the paper.

15:36.735 --> 15:40.623
Coach, look at my little girl
out there.

15:40.873 --> 15:46.745
- You're breakin' her heart!
- Believe me, art.
I am hugely conflicted.

15:46.745 --> 15:48.747
But rhode island
doubled my salary!

15:49.248 --> 15:52.751
They're giving my daughter
a full ride!
What could i do?

15:52.751 --> 15:57.006
- They made me an offer
i couldn't refuse.
- You haven't heard ours.

15:57.389 --> 15:59.391
Come on, sil.
Look, buddy,
i got a family too.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.394
I happen to have a daughter
who loves playing soccer
very much.

16:02.394 --> 16:05.898
Just kiddin'
about the offer thing.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.400
Hey, nobody blew a whistle!

16:08.901 --> 16:11.403
Let's not get lazy
out here! Come on!

16:11.403 --> 16:15.157
- Why don't you
go fuck yourself?
- Excuse me?

16:15.157 --> 16:17.776
Hey, med, want me
to tell your father--
this is my field.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.915
Why don't you give me
ten laps around the goals!

16:23.165 --> 16:24.667
Whatever.
Make that 20.

16:25.167 --> 16:27.786
Anybody else
wanna mouth off?

16:29.788 --> 16:32.791
Good! Come on!
Let's circle up
for keep- away!

16:33.042 --> 16:35.544
Let's go! Over here!
Get in a big circle!

16:35.544 --> 16:37.680
Go! Come on! Move it!

16:37.680 --> 16:39.682
Out here!
I need some people out here!

16:39.682 --> 16:41.934
Come on! Let's go!

16:54.446 --> 16:56.448
Gimme your glass.

16:58.951 --> 17:01.453
Who would've ever thought
we could've been
this contented?

17:01.453 --> 17:05.958
I did. As soon
as i saw you, i knew.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.460
You're a sweetheart.

17:08.460 --> 17:12.464
If only they knew
the other side of you.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.467
They'd eat me
for breakfast.
Mmm.

17:15.467 --> 17:18.971
I've been lookin'
at some real estate.
Some nice houses on the market.

17:18.971 --> 17:21.473
Maybe you'd like
something bigger.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.977
No, corrado.
This is our place.

17:24.977 --> 17:28.981
You know how long
we been comin' here?
Sixteen years.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.983
And every one of them good.

17:32.484 --> 17:36.989
How's junior, junior?
Hmm?

17:36.989 --> 17:39.491
He's catching some shuteye.

17:39.491 --> 17:43.495
Oh. You're such
a powerhouse.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.498
When you kiss me
down there,

17:46.498 --> 17:50.002
you're like
a great artist.

17:50.002 --> 17:53.005
You got a real instinct
for it.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.508
Pass me the red peppers.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.022
You know the thrill
you give?

18:12.024 --> 18:15.527
Just keep it to yourself,
okay, roberta?
Yeah.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.529
All to myself.

18:26.038 --> 18:29.541
Corrado?
Yeah?

18:29.541 --> 18:31.543
Why the big secret?

18:31.543 --> 18:35.547
About what?
Oral sex.

18:36.048 --> 18:39.551
What's so terrible
about pleasing a woman?

18:41.553 --> 18:46.058
You always have to
talk about everything.
I wanna know why!

18:46.058 --> 18:49.061
It's complicated.
Yeah.

18:49.561 --> 18:53.065
But why?
Why?

18:53.065 --> 18:56.068
Because they think
if you'll suck pussy,
you'll suck anything.

18:56.068 --> 18:59.071
Oh, you're kidding.
It's a sign of weakness.

18:59.571 --> 19:03.575
And possibly a sign
that you're afinocch'.

19:03.575 --> 19:07.579
A fag?
That's ridiculous.

19:09.581 --> 19:11.583
How would the two
even translate?

19:14.086 --> 19:17.089
What are you gonna do?
I mean, i don't make the rules.

19:20.676 --> 19:22.678
Hey, it's not big
lifestyle choice, shylockin'.

19:22.678 --> 19:25.180
My aunts quintima
and gemma.

19:25.430 --> 19:28.433
They got money out
earnin' on the street.
It's like bein' a banker.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.936
You help people.

19:33.438 --> 19:35.941
Chiara broke down in tears
when she heard the coach
was leaving.

19:35.941 --> 19:38.443
You don't wanna
talk about it, fine.
No, i--

19:38.944 --> 19:43.448
i gotta go pick up
carmela at her sister's.
Let me ask you a question.

19:43.448 --> 19:46.451
Why does your wife hate me?
Charmaine doesn't hate you.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.956
Yeah.

19:50.956 --> 19:53.959
You lie
like i play the french horn.
What?

19:55.961 --> 20:00.465
Look at the fuckin'faccim
over here. Wearing a cap
in a nice restaurant like this.

20:02.968 --> 20:05.971
That's one of the things
i hated most when i had
my restaurant.

20:06.471 --> 20:10.475
It's values today.
Standards are crumbling.

20:12.477 --> 20:15.981
Would it have killed
this coach to stick around
until my kid graduates?

20:15.981 --> 20:18.483
Then let him stay four years
for chiara.

20:18.483 --> 20:21.987
Hi.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.240
That burns my ass.

20:27.242 --> 20:29.244
Where you goin'?

20:29.745 --> 20:33.248
That would be great.

20:33.248 --> 20:37.252
- Take your hat off.
- Excuse me?

20:37.252 --> 20:40.756
They don't sell hot dogs here.
They took the bleachers out
two years ago.

20:40.756 --> 20:42.758
It's my hat.
I'll wear it where i want.

21:00.275 --> 21:02.277
How you doin'?

21:12.404 --> 21:17.409
- Thank you.
- Look at him. Douche bag.

21:17.409 --> 21:20.412
Good for you!

21:20.412 --> 21:22.914
Um, send them a bottle
of montepulciano.

21:22.914 --> 21:26.918
And, uh, get the license plate
of these two guys
sittin' behind artie.

21:26.918 --> 21:28.920
Get the valet to do it.
They look like cops.

21:42.934 --> 21:45.437
I hear a voice

21:45.937 --> 21:48.440
well, look who's here!
Hi!

21:50.692 --> 21:53.695
Tony, look who's here!
Alphonse, how you doin'?

21:53.945 --> 21:56.448
Good. Yeah.
You feelin' better?

21:59.835 --> 22:02.337
Gonna miss that
left foot of yours.
Tony.

22:02.337 --> 22:06.341
No, it's okay, mr. Soprano.
I'm gonna play.
No shit.

22:06.341 --> 22:09.845
Pardon my french there.
You sure, ally?

22:09.845 --> 22:13.849
Yeah, i-- i had a long talk
with coach hauser and--

22:16.351 --> 22:18.353
i'm gonna play.
That's all.

22:18.353 --> 22:21.356
- I told her she didn't have to.
- Just said she wanted to.

22:23.859 --> 22:27.362
- Yeah.
- Did coach pressure you,
ally?

22:27.362 --> 22:29.865
No, mrs. Soprano.
He would never do anything
like that.

22:29.865 --> 22:32.367
How's he gonna pressure her?
He didn't have thecoglione
to stick around.

22:32.367 --> 22:34.369
Dad.
What?

22:36.238 --> 22:38.240
It's what we all wanted.

22:40.742 --> 22:43.745
Okay. Right?
Long as everything's, uh--

22:44.246 --> 22:47.249
look, we're trying
to watch this, guys, okay?

22:48.750 --> 22:50.752
Kick ass, girls.
Right?

22:50.752 --> 22:53.255
Good night.

23:14.276 --> 23:16.778
Listen, roberta.
What i said earlier?

23:16.778 --> 23:19.281
Mm- hmm.
I'm serious.

23:19.281 --> 23:22.784
You discuss that with anyone,
we're gonna go ten rounds.

23:22.784 --> 23:25.787
We just skimmed 20 thou
off the development fund,

23:25.787 --> 23:28.790
and you're worried about
a littlelecca fica?

23:28.790 --> 23:31.793
Will you keep it down?
All right.

23:31.793 --> 23:36.298
I'll tell everyone
you're a good kisser.
I just won't say where.

23:36.298 --> 23:39.301
That's my reputation
you're playin' with.

23:39.301 --> 23:43.805
Honey, my lips are sealed.

23:43.805 --> 23:47.309
Not too sealed, right?

23:47.809 --> 23:51.313
Visual on corrado soprano
and female travel companion,

23:51.313 --> 23:54.816
2200 hours, boca lounge.

24:09.214 --> 24:11.216
Hey, hey, hey!
How's my boy today, huh?

24:11.216 --> 24:14.219
Go, go, go!

24:17.222 --> 24:18.723
I'm lookin' for, uh,
coach hauser?

24:19.224 --> 24:21.726
That's me. Petey!
Come here!

24:23.228 --> 24:25.597
A little somethin'
from your friends
at the bada bing club.

24:26.097 --> 24:30.485
Brand new, surround sound,
hdtv compatible.

24:30.485 --> 24:33.355
- Well, tell them thanks, but--
- this fucker's gettin' heavy.

24:33.855 --> 24:36.858
If this is about rhode island,
tell your friends it's
a done deal. I already signed.

24:36.858 --> 24:41.363
I don't know what it's about,
but the tv stays here.
Put it down.

24:41.363 --> 24:43.365
No!

24:43.365 --> 24:46.868
I mean it! Pick it up!
Get the goddamn thing
off my property!

24:46.868 --> 24:49.871
Look, pal, i don't think
you quite understand.

24:50.372 --> 24:51.873
Oh, i understand
only too well.

24:52.374 --> 24:54.376
You tell your friends
i know all about them.

24:54.376 --> 24:56.878
If you did,
you'd do what they want.

24:57.379 --> 25:00.882
Is that a threat?
How quickly things change.

25:00.882 --> 25:03.385
Let me tell you something,
guido--
my name is clarence.

25:03.385 --> 25:07.389
I have friends in
law enforcement, and they
would call this extortion.

25:08.890 --> 25:12.527
Come on.

25:12.527 --> 25:18.033
You tell those assholes
don hauser will not be
intimidated!

25:18.033 --> 25:21.036
I will not be threatened
or bribed!

25:21.152 --> 25:23.655
I go where i want to
when i want to!

25:26.157 --> 25:28.159
Hey!

25:30.662 --> 25:34.583
All day, every day,
85 and not one drop of rain.

25:34.583 --> 25:37.085
Oh, and those nights.

25:37.469 --> 25:40.472
Bobbi, you are so lucky
with this guy.
You have no idea.

25:40.722 --> 25:42.224
He's a sweetheart
underneath it all.

25:42.724 --> 25:45.477
I wish i could get lou
to be like him.

25:45.977 --> 25:48.480
More sensitive,
if you know what i mean.

25:48.480 --> 25:54.102
That coral looks good.
I don't understand why i always
have to ask him for oral sex.

25:55.604 --> 25:59.608
Not like you
and your corrado.
Bebe, listen.

25:59.858 --> 26:02.360
I know we always used to
yak about our sex lives.

26:02.861 --> 26:05.864
I think it would be better
if we didn't anymore.

26:05.864 --> 26:08.250
Okay.
I mean it.

26:08.617 --> 26:12.120
Sure. It's just
you're lucky, that's all.

26:18.877 --> 26:21.763
- So, ma, you gonna come
to the big game?
- Game?

26:21.763 --> 26:25.267
What game?
Miss meadow's soccer team
is goin' to the sectionals.

26:25.517 --> 26:29.771
- Nobody tells me anything.
- Everybody hear me just tell
my mother about the game?

26:30.021 --> 26:34.025
Can anybody
think of anything else
to talk about except soccer?

26:34.526 --> 26:37.028
All right. Uncle jun',
how was boca?

26:37.028 --> 26:40.031
Wonderful.
I don't go down enough.

26:40.398 --> 26:42.901
That's not what i heard.

26:43.902 --> 26:46.404
About what?

26:47.906 --> 26:50.909
Nothing. I'm sorry.
I-- i don't know
what i'm talkin' about.

26:50.909 --> 26:54.412
- Last time, aunt bobbi
bought me a live piranha.
- You believe that was a piranha.

26:54.663 --> 26:57.666
That woman is not your aunt!

26:57.666 --> 27:00.168
Livia, i warned you.
Stata zit'.
Bobbi's a sweet, sweet girl.

27:00.669 --> 27:04.673
- What the hell's
the matter with you? -

27:04.673 --> 27:07.175
what did i say?

27:07.309 --> 27:09.811
This wife of yours.
She's got the giggles.

27:09.811 --> 27:13.315
- Can i be excused?
- We just sat down.

27:13.315 --> 27:16.685
- How are you gonna play
tomorrow, you don't eat?
- He's right. You need protein.

27:16.685 --> 27:19.688
- No, i don't because i quit.
- You quit.

27:19.688 --> 27:22.691
What are you talkin' about?
With ally back, you can
go to the state.

27:22.824 --> 27:25.327
A girl slits her wrists
and you can think about
is a game?

27:25.327 --> 27:29.331
It wasn't like friggin' cobain.
It was just a little
suicidal gesture.

27:30.448 --> 27:33.451
- Come back here!
- You're not excused!

27:33.451 --> 27:35.587
Oh, let her go.
Go ahead, honey!

27:35.587 --> 27:37.589
Ma!
Why don't you butt out?

27:37.589 --> 27:40.842
Only time you act like
a grandmother is when
you wanna score some points.

27:42.344 --> 27:47.849
I will not eat in this house.
Junior, take me home.

27:48.350 --> 27:51.469
- I'm not finished.
- Youmangia, uncle jun'.
She'll come back.

27:55.607 --> 27:58.109
The stukas and messerschmitts.

27:58.109 --> 28:00.612
They have command
of the skies.

28:03.114 --> 28:07.619
The stuka is quite
a formidable weapon.

28:07.619 --> 28:11.623
I don't know.
I'm glad meadow quit.

28:11.623 --> 28:15.126
That coach pushes them
to the brink.
It's unhealthy.

28:15.627 --> 28:17.879
Well, what do we mean
when we talk about commitment?

28:17.879 --> 28:20.382
And that asshole.
He thinks he can just
walk away?

28:20.498 --> 28:22.500
Watch it, cowboy.
Don't start.

28:24.502 --> 28:26.888
What was with you
and uncle jun' tonight?

28:27.389 --> 28:29.758
You better not get
in that coach's face.
Tell me about uncle jun'.

28:29.758 --> 28:31.760
No, no, stop it!
Stop it!

28:31.760 --> 28:33.762
I can't, i can't.

28:33.762 --> 28:36.264
Yes, you can.
I know you want to.
All right. Okay.

28:38.767 --> 28:44.022
Gabby dante's cousin and bobbi
go to the same nail parlor.
And--

28:45.523 --> 28:49.778
your uncle-- no, i shouldn't
say. I shouldn't!

28:49.778 --> 28:52.163
Come on.
Okay, okay! Okay.

28:55.166 --> 28:58.169
Well, let's just say...

28:58.169 --> 29:02.674
your uncle has acquired
a taste for her.

29:02.674 --> 29:06.928
Uncle jun' gives head.
World- class.

29:06.928 --> 29:10.432
The old man's whistlin'
to the wheat field?
Don't be disgusting.

29:10.432 --> 29:12.434
He's a bushman
of the kalahari!

29:12.434 --> 29:16.438
That's why i don't tell you
anything. 'cause you
don't know when to stop.

29:16.438 --> 29:18.940
Oh, my god,
if this ever gets out.

29:18.940 --> 29:23.945
Like you don't do it,
or any of your friends.
Bunch of hypocrites.

29:23.945 --> 29:27.949
Hey. What goes on
in this bedroom stays here,
and you know that.

29:27.949 --> 29:32.954
Once a year?
I can resist the urge
to gossip.

29:44.082 --> 29:47.085
Arthur? You're home?

29:47.085 --> 29:49.587
The grease in that "fryolater."

29:49.587 --> 29:52.090
I'm gonna smell like
a cheap french fry
for the rest of my life.

29:52.590 --> 29:56.594
So this is why we scrimp
and save to send our kids
to that school, huh?

29:57.095 --> 29:59.597
So that you can have our name
just dragged through the mud?

29:59.597 --> 30:04.102
What?
Shelly hauser called me
this afternoon.

30:04.102 --> 30:08.106
Your friends sent somewayos
down there with a stolen
tv set...

30:08.106 --> 30:10.108
to try and bribe the coach.

30:10.108 --> 30:12.610
From your friends
at bada bing.

30:12.744 --> 30:17.749
As if a tv set is gonna
get somewhere with a man
like coach hauser!

30:17.749 --> 30:19.751
A tv set?

30:19.751 --> 30:24.255
Arthur, do you
honestly believe that
they're gonna stop there?

30:24.255 --> 30:27.258
They tried
bribing this man.

30:27.258 --> 30:30.762
What's next?
Always with
the extreme scenarios.

30:30.762 --> 30:33.264
No, come on, arthur.
Tell me. What's next?

30:33.264 --> 30:35.266
You grew up
in the neighborhood.

30:35.266 --> 30:39.270
Don't pretend
like you don't know what
tony soprano is capable of.

30:41.639 --> 30:44.776
Who is it?
I found your dog.

30:52.033 --> 30:56.037
What?
No, you're mistaken.
My dog is upstairs.

30:56.154 --> 30:59.657
Golden retriever,
blue nylon collar?

30:59.657 --> 31:02.160
Honey, who is it?
Evenin', ma'am.

31:04.662 --> 31:07.165
He has our dog.

31:07.165 --> 31:10.168
Where's petey?
I thought he was locked in.
Yeah, come get him.

31:10.668 --> 31:13.171
I wouldn't want petey
to get hit by a car.

31:29.938 --> 31:32.941
Petey, petey!

31:32.941 --> 31:35.944
You okay? Come here.
What, no reward?

31:37.445 --> 31:39.948
Just kiddin'.
I'm an animal lover.

31:41.950 --> 31:43.952
You okay, boy?

31:44.586 --> 31:47.088
Med, you can cheer up
about the coach,

31:47.088 --> 31:49.591
'cause i got a feelin'
he's gonna reconsider
the big move.

31:49.591 --> 31:53.094
- Tony!
- Did you do something?

31:53.094 --> 31:55.096
What could i do?
Point is...

31:55.096 --> 31:58.099
he's gonna stick around
and finish what he started
with the girls, that's all.

32:00.602 --> 32:04.606
That's it.
Well, did i tell you?

32:10.478 --> 32:12.981
You need to develop
some appreciation'cause you
got people all around you...

32:13.481 --> 32:16.985
tryin' to help you and
all you do is bitch and moan!

32:16.985 --> 32:20.989
I see this coach tryin' to
abandon his team. I see
your friends gettin' worked up.

32:20.989 --> 32:24.993
So i try to do somethin'!
Is that why you think
we're so upset, dad?

32:24.993 --> 32:28.997
Because a coach that most of us
can't even stand is leaving?

32:28.997 --> 32:32.500
So, w- what difference
does that make? You don't have
to love him to be successful.

32:32.634 --> 32:34.135
Catfish hunter
hated billy martin.

32:34.636 --> 32:38.139
Bill parcells, his guys,
they can't stand him
till they start to win!

32:38.256 --> 32:40.758
Coach hauser had sex
with ally!

32:42.143 --> 32:44.646
What?
That's why she cut herself.

32:44.646 --> 32:49.150
That's why i've been
practically living at her house.

32:49.150 --> 32:51.653
All right,
hold on a minute.

32:51.653 --> 32:54.656
Maybe--

32:54.656 --> 32:56.774
with ally?

32:58.276 --> 33:02.163
Meadow,
this is horrible. This is
also a very serious accusation.

33:02.163 --> 33:05.533
- What exactly did ally say?
- That they had sex!

33:05.533 --> 33:09.037
More than once! That she's
not a virgin anymore!

33:11.923 --> 33:14.425
All right.

33:14.425 --> 33:16.928
Ally's a very...
pretty girl.

33:17.178 --> 33:19.681
Maybe there was--
maybe there was some confusion.

33:19.681 --> 33:22.183
Maybe she wanted to...

33:22.183 --> 33:24.185
look like she was sophisticated
in you guys' eyes.
Dad!

33:26.688 --> 33:30.191
What?
Tony! What if
this had been meadow?

33:30.558 --> 33:32.560
What kind of confusion?

33:32.560 --> 33:35.563
A girl that age, the coach
should not have been
in any position...

33:36.064 --> 33:39.200
where there's even
a remote possibility
of confusion!

33:40.702 --> 33:42.704
I'm losin'
my fuckin' mind here.

33:42.820 --> 33:45.073
Tony, go downstairs,
will you, please,
so me and meadow can talk?

33:45.073 --> 33:48.576
Jesus fuckin' christ!

33:48.826 --> 33:50.828
God, now what did i do?

33:51.212 --> 33:55.216
Meadow.
Mom, i only told so he wouldn't
make coach hauser stay here.

33:55.216 --> 33:58.720
Meadow, this is
a horrible, horrible thing.

33:58.720 --> 34:02.223
Mom, she's in love with him,
but he won't leave his wife.

34:02.223 --> 34:04.726
Leave his wife?
Meadow!

34:07.228 --> 34:11.733
Now, meadow, he didn't
touch you, right?
No, but what about deena?

34:11.733 --> 34:14.735
If she finds out
about her father,
it'll totally destroy her life.

34:14.735 --> 34:17.739
Just tell dad to let him go
anywhere he wants, okay?

34:18.239 --> 34:20.241
Come here. Oh.

34:27.498 --> 34:30.501
Moldonado and his brother,
they'll handle it.

34:30.501 --> 34:33.504
Mal owes me a solid.

34:33.504 --> 34:36.007
No. No hired help.

34:36.007 --> 34:38.009
This is personal.

34:38.009 --> 34:42.013
Very glad to hear you say that.
I'll give him a real
after- school special.

34:46.516 --> 34:48.518
You outta
your fuckin' mind?
What?

34:48.886 --> 34:51.889
I know you
kidnapped the coach's dog
and all that other shit.

34:52.389 --> 34:54.391
But if you
do one more thing--
aw, shut up, arthur.

34:54.391 --> 34:57.395
You know, you're
five fuckin' time zones
behind your own ass.

34:57.395 --> 35:00.898
No, i'm fuckin' serious.
You hear me, tony?

35:01.899 --> 35:03.901
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

35:03.901 --> 35:06.904
You wanna hear serious?
You wanna know what your
wonderful fuckin' coach did?

35:07.405 --> 35:12.410
He fucked little
ally vandermeed and who
knows who else he fucked.

35:12.410 --> 35:14.662
What are you talkin' about?
"Fucked"?

35:17.665 --> 35:21.669
- That's crazy.
- That's why that kid slit
her wrists, youstunad'.

35:21.919 --> 35:27.175
And my daughter should know
this shit, should have to
think about that filth?

35:27.175 --> 35:29.177
No.
No.

35:29.677 --> 35:34.682
That self- righteous prick
put his dick in my little girl's
soccer teammate.

35:35.183 --> 35:40.571
She's in eleventh grade,
for christ's sake.
Oh, my god.

35:40.822 --> 35:44.325
Chiara. He drove her home from
the supermarket one night.

35:44.325 --> 35:48.329
- Oh, my little girl.
- Fuckin' degenerate
son of a bitch.

35:48.446 --> 35:51.332
He deserves to die.
Betrayin' children?

35:51.332 --> 35:54.836
Artie, believe me,
he ain't gonna be
doin' that shit no more.

35:54.836 --> 35:57.338
I guarantee you that.

36:06.714 --> 36:08.716
He's in the pro shop!

36:13.721 --> 36:15.723
I don't need a cart!

36:17.725 --> 36:20.228
Nobody told you to put
my nephew under surveillance.

36:20.228 --> 36:23.231
I know, junior.
I know.

36:23.231 --> 36:26.234
I just wanted to be
on the safe side,
and i'm glad i did.

36:26.234 --> 36:29.237
Because your nephew
is not just hangin' out
at that titty bar...

36:29.737 --> 36:31.739
and goin' to his daughter's
soccer games.

36:31.739 --> 36:35.243
Go ahead.
Twice last week...

36:35.243 --> 36:38.246
he goes toward
the medical center,
then they lose him.

36:38.746 --> 36:41.749
A girlfriend.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

36:41.749 --> 36:44.752
He's seein' this
russian slit, very open.

36:44.752 --> 36:46.754
Your nephew
is talking to the feds.

36:46.754 --> 36:50.758
Where else would he be goin'
where it would require
such precautions?

36:50.758 --> 36:53.761
And what the fuck else
would be the big secret?

36:53.761 --> 36:55.763
What am i, a swami?

36:57.265 --> 36:59.767
Hey.

36:59.767 --> 37:03.271
Silvio! You're lookin'
good. I like that hat.
Mikey palmice.

37:03.271 --> 37:07.275
How you feel?

37:10.027 --> 37:13.531
You shanked it, sil.
I still got the coach
on my mind.

37:15.032 --> 37:19.537
We got fresh air,
sunshine, a beautiful day.
Forget about that shit.

37:19.537 --> 37:23.541
- Thank god for golf some days.
- I'm trying to concentrate
here.

37:25.793 --> 37:29.297
- Did you get any golf in
down in boca, uncle jun'?
- Fuckin' manners! Please!

37:34.552 --> 37:37.054
So you play, uh, manatee
or what's the name
of the other one?

37:37.054 --> 37:42.059
Will you let the man tee off?
You yap worse than six barbers.

37:42.059 --> 37:44.562
If you'd have shut up
during that game
against mountain lakes,

37:44.562 --> 37:47.565
you wouldn't have missed
that fuckin' fly ball.

37:47.565 --> 37:49.567
I was ashamed
to face my friends.

37:51.569 --> 37:54.572
Good mikey. Better.

37:54.572 --> 37:58.576
What do you mean,"better"?
Well, you know,
it's...better.

38:04.832 --> 38:09.720
- Whoa, junior!
- "Whoa, junior" what?

38:09.720 --> 38:12.974
Uncle junior's into muff.
What?

38:13.975 --> 38:17.228
Oh, did i say "muff"?
I meant "rough."

38:20.231 --> 38:22.233
Good shot.

38:25.486 --> 38:28.489
What's that smell?
Did you guys go to a sushi bar?

38:28.739 --> 38:31.242
What the fuck's
he talkin' about?
I don't know.

38:31.242 --> 38:34.862
I thought you were
a baccala man, uncle jun'. What
are you doin' eatin' sushi?

38:35.246 --> 38:38.499
You're fuckin' runnin' off
at the mouth, you know that?

38:40.001 --> 38:42.870
South of the border?

38:43.371 --> 38:45.873
Down mexico way

38:45.873 --> 38:49.510
listen, my friend.
At least i can deal...

38:49.510 --> 38:52.013
with my own problems,
unlike some i know.

38:52.013 --> 38:56.017
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Take it however you want.
Don't bullshit with me.

38:56.017 --> 38:58.636
Guys, guys.
We here to play golf or what?

38:59.020 --> 39:01.889
Come on.

39:02.890 --> 39:04.392
South of the border?

39:04.892 --> 39:08.029
Where the tuna fish play

39:08.529 --> 39:12.033
arthur.

39:12.033 --> 39:14.535
Everybody's just so upset.

39:14.535 --> 39:18.539
The mother's on sedatives.
She's completely
unable to deal.

39:18.539 --> 39:21.042
The father was
in europe somewhere.
They haven't reached him.

39:21.042 --> 39:25.046
The little girl, ally, she
thinks it's all her fault.

39:25.046 --> 39:27.548
Lousy bastard. He's not
gonna get away with this.

39:27.548 --> 39:30.051
You got that right.

39:30.551 --> 39:32.553
What?

39:33.554 --> 39:36.057
Hand me that bottle
of bug be gone,
will ya?

39:36.557 --> 39:38.559
Arthur, what?

39:40.561 --> 39:44.565
Somethin' goin' on,
artie?

39:45.066 --> 39:47.435
Your mobster friend
gonna do somethin' crazy?

39:49.937 --> 39:52.940
If i had any balls,
i would do it myself.

39:53.324 --> 39:56.444
Arthur, you do have balls.
That's why you're not like him.

39:56.944 --> 40:00.448
Fuck it. Fuck the world!

40:00.831 --> 40:03.334
Artie, this isn't makin'
some slob take his hat off.

40:03.334 --> 40:08.589
This is beating a man to death
or cutting his balls off
or what?

40:08.589 --> 40:11.842
You can't tell me coach hauser
doesn't deserve it!

40:12.343 --> 40:16.347
Okay, but-- listen to you.
Think about what you're saying.

40:16.714 --> 40:18.215
Yeah, you tell me.

40:18.716 --> 40:22.219
Who's worse? Tony soprano
or that child- molesting fuck?

40:22.470 --> 40:26.223
I trusted him.
I'd like to rip his heart
out of his chest!

40:26.223 --> 40:30.111
Jesus christ, arthur.
I cannot believe you only
think about yourself!

40:30.611 --> 40:34.365
Myself? Myself?

40:34.732 --> 40:37.985
I resent that, charmaine!

40:49.130 --> 40:51.132
Junior, what the fuck?
What's the matter?

40:54.135 --> 40:56.137
What? That bullshit
with the sushi?

40:58.639 --> 41:02.643
Nah, i-- i don't know
what he was talkin' about.
He, uh, he babbles.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.762
What was that?
You're another one!

41:05.262 --> 41:08.015
Me? Hey, he completely
lacked respect.

41:08.015 --> 41:10.518
Sick and tired of having to
make excuses for him
all the time.

41:11.018 --> 41:13.521
- It isn't right.
- It's'cause he's
a fucking mental weakling.

41:13.521 --> 41:16.023
- I know.
- You don't know shit, mikey!

41:20.911 --> 41:24.915
He's seein' a psychiatrist,
for christ's sake.
How about that, huh?

41:24.915 --> 41:29.420
My nephew
is seein' a psychiatrist.
Makes me wanna cry.

41:29.420 --> 41:34.425
- No shit?
- Indictment's being prepared.
He's spilling his guts.

41:34.425 --> 41:37.928
- I fuckin' knew it.
- No, you didn't
fuckin' know it!

41:37.928 --> 41:40.931
I just told you.

41:42.433 --> 41:46.437
God knows how much of
our family business he airs.
If the place is bugged--

41:46.937 --> 41:48.439
that stuff's not admissible.

41:48.939 --> 41:53.444
It's that, uh, that, that
doctor/patient privilege,
just like us and melvoin.

41:53.444 --> 41:56.947
Melvoin's a lawyer.
He's in the fuckin' ballpark.

41:56.947 --> 41:59.450
Suppose this shrink
gets scared or somethin'?

41:59.950 --> 42:02.453
Do you remember those fuckin'
escovedo brothers, whoever
the fuck, in california?

42:02.953 --> 42:06.957
They whacked their parents?
Their shrink was in
a fuckin' witness chair.

42:06.957 --> 42:09.960
Shit.

42:12.963 --> 42:15.466
Anthony wants to play games,
okay.

42:15.466 --> 42:18.969
I taught him games.

42:18.969 --> 42:21.472
I taught him
how to play baseball.

42:25.476 --> 42:26.977
You talking
about clippin' him?

42:26.977 --> 42:29.480
Nobody would slap my wrist
if i did.

42:31.949 --> 42:34.068
There's guys in prison
that have done half the damage
this prick has.

42:34.568 --> 42:38.439
The judicial system has gotten
much better in dealing with
sexual predators.

42:38.439 --> 42:40.441
Oh, yeah.
Let's impeach him.

42:40.441 --> 42:42.443
If you're telling me of intent
to harm this person,

42:42.443 --> 42:46.447
i must warn you of my duty
to alert law enforcement.

42:46.580 --> 42:49.083
I don't know why
i tell you anything.
I'm interested...

42:49.199 --> 42:52.703
in why you feel punishing
this man falls upon you.

42:52.953 --> 42:55.339
- Well, it sure doesn't
fall upon you.
- What do you mean?

42:55.339 --> 42:57.341
What would you do?
You'd call the cops,

42:57.341 --> 43:00.344
who'd get some judge
who'd give him
psychiatric counseling.

43:00.344 --> 43:02.346
So maybe he could talk about
his unhappy childhood...

43:02.846 --> 43:06.467
and we could have sympathy
for the fuck'cause he's
the real victim here, right?

43:06.467 --> 43:09.853
You know what you do? Stick
your head in the sand'cause
that's what people like you do.

43:09.853 --> 43:12.473
Discredit psychology
all you want,

43:12.473 --> 43:14.975
but i continue
to ask the question:

43:14.975 --> 43:20.364
Why do you think
you, anthony soprano,
always has to set things right?

43:28.989 --> 43:31.492
Hey, paulie. Is tony in?
Tony!

43:31.492 --> 43:33.994
- Artie!
- Hey, ton', i gotta talk to ya.

43:34.495 --> 43:37.247
- Kinda busy right now.
- I gotta talk to you.

43:39.133 --> 43:41.885
All right, we'll, uh,
finish later, all right?

43:54.398 --> 43:56.900
Come on in.
Hey.

44:02.406 --> 44:06.910
It's about, uh, the thing.

44:06.910 --> 44:09.413
You know what?

44:09.530 --> 44:12.533
Nothing's happened yet,
has it?

44:12.533 --> 44:16.670
Just gotta make the call.
I'm savorin' the moment.

44:16.670 --> 44:18.922
- You gotta call it off.
- Don't worry about it.

44:18.922 --> 44:21.425
You got nothin' to do
with it. You don't
go nowheres near this.

44:21.925 --> 44:25.295
I don't care about that!
It's wrong, tony.

44:25.796 --> 44:29.800
You can't do it.
It's wrong?
Oh, what he did isn't?

44:29.933 --> 44:32.436
I'm beggin' you.
I hate the guy too.

44:34.054 --> 44:36.440
What do you wanna do,
artie?

44:36.440 --> 44:40.444
You wanna call the cops?
Here. Here's the phone.

44:40.444 --> 44:44.565
They'll arrest him, right?
He'll get out in two fuckin'
years, move to saskatchewan.

44:44.565 --> 44:48.569
Then you know what he'll do?
He'll teach girls' soccer,
and he'll start all over again.

44:48.952 --> 44:52.956
You don't think
i wanna rip him apart
like a fuckin' chicken?

44:52.956 --> 44:56.460
I drove by his house.
I almost got out.

44:56.460 --> 44:58.462
But you didn't.

44:58.962 --> 45:02.583
Something happens to him,
who's it gonna help, huh?
His daughter?

45:03.083 --> 45:07.087
That girl? No, you, tony.

45:07.087 --> 45:09.590
And silvio and me and whoever.

45:09.590 --> 45:12.092
It's just gonna
make us feel better.

45:12.092 --> 45:16.597
So don't even think about
calling this justice.
Leave it to the cops.

45:17.097 --> 45:19.099
Let me ask you a question.

45:19.099 --> 45:23.103
Who the fuck do you think
you are comin' in here,
talkin' to me like this?

45:23.103 --> 45:27.107
Now your boyfriend
is finished.
You deal with it.

45:27.107 --> 45:30.611
Okay?
Tony, don't do it.

45:30.611 --> 45:34.114
This is me asking you.
Why don't you
get the fuck outta here?

45:34.114 --> 45:37.618
Come on.
Get the fuck out!
Go!

45:37.618 --> 45:40.621
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

45:53.634 --> 45:56.136
Oh, yeah

45:56.136 --> 45:58.138
oh, yeah

46:07.397 --> 46:08.899

46:18.792 --> 46:20.794

dewayne

46:59.082 --> 47:01.585
corrado.

47:03.086 --> 47:06.590
I was worried! You usually
call me when you're this late.

47:06.590 --> 47:12.095
I bought us some
barbecued chicken, some salad
and some lemon meringue pie.

47:12.095 --> 47:14.097
But i got so hungry,
i had a piece.

47:14.097 --> 47:17.100
Did i tell you
to keep your mouth shut?
What?

47:17.100 --> 47:20.103
Did i tell you to keep
your goddamned mouth shut?

47:20.103 --> 47:23.106
No, corrado, don't hit me!

47:39.373 --> 47:41.375
You stupid, fucking,
blabbermouth cunt!

47:41.875 --> 47:44.878
I don't understand.

47:44.878 --> 47:47.381
Get your pencils
and your crap and
the rest of your shit...

47:47.881 --> 47:50.884
and don't be here tomorrow!

47:51.001 --> 47:54.755
Oh, no, corrado, don't leave!
I love you!

47:56.757 --> 47:59.259
I am so sorry!

47:59.393 --> 48:01.395
No, corrado!

48:22.666 --> 48:24.668
Yeah.
You there at the place?

48:25.168 --> 48:26.670
Is he in the house?
Yeah.

48:27.170 --> 48:29.673
Fuck it. Walk away.

48:29.673 --> 48:31.675
Just fuckin' walk away.
Don't do it.

48:31.675 --> 48:33.677
Fuck!

48:33.677 --> 48:35.679
All right.
Leave it alone.

48:35.679 --> 48:38.181
Yeah, no problem.

48:38.181 --> 48:40.684
Son of a bitch.

48:41.184 --> 48:43.186
Lynn, we are here live
as colleagues and neighbors...

48:43.687 --> 48:47.307
were shocked to hear of charges
brought against donald hauser,

48:47.441 --> 48:50.444
coach of the
verbum dei high school
girls' soccer team.

48:50.944 --> 48:53.447
Alerted by a student friend
of the alleged victim,

48:53.814 --> 48:56.450
whose name cannot be revealed
because of her age,

48:56.450 --> 48:58.952
police issued a warrant for
hauser's arrest this evening.

49:10.330 --> 49:13.333
Tony.
In my hometown

49:13.333 --> 49:15.836
tony, jesus.
Where i live

49:15.836 --> 49:19.339
you smell like
lord calvert.

49:22.843 --> 49:24.845
Tony.

49:27.848 --> 49:30.350
We don't talk
we all get together

49:30.350 --> 49:34.354
any kind of weather
and we do the camel walk

49:41.862 --> 49:46.366

49:46.366 --> 49:48.502
Tony, what is this?

49:48.502 --> 49:51.505
Oh, jesus.

49:51.505 --> 49:55.008
Mixed with alcohol.
Oh, tony, that's wonderful.

49:55.008 --> 49:59.629
- Happy trails.
Here, let's get you to bed.
- Carmela.

49:59.629 --> 50:02.132
Carmela.

50:03.633 --> 50:05.635
I didn't hurt nobody.

50:19.282 --> 50:21.284
Call the shrink.

50:21.785 --> 50:23.787
Tell her the town's gonna go
to the fuckin' mormons.

50:47.894 --> 50:49.996
I hear a voice

50:52.699 --> 50:55.035
from the back of the room

50:57.804 --> 50:59.906
