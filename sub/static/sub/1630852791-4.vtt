00:14.682 --> 00:17.216
[Brad] It was between
six-and-a-half and seven feet tall.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.051
It was as broad as it was wide.

00:19.053 --> 00:20.686
- So, you saw it?
- I saw it.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.820
<i>[narrator] As the mystery</i>

[Willy] Hey, guys.
We've got blood.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.691
- What?
- What?

01:32.693 --> 01:34.626
[Huck] Oh.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.994
[Buck]
<i>We're in the Tygart Valley.</i>

01:35.996 --> 01:38.630
And we're hot on the trail
of the Grafton monster.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.365
<i>This creature was first spotted</i>

01:40.367 --> 01:43.268
<i>in Grafton, West Virginia,
in 1964.</i>

01:43.270 --> 01:45.404
Oh, yeah,
we're on a blood trail now.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.372
<i>[Buck] And this team, we believe</i>

01:47.374 --> 01:50.609
that he has migrated
right here to Tygart Valley.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.244
Dude, we've got a steady
blood trail now.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.313
- Look here. Right here.
- Don't look away there.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.782
- Daggone, look at this, look.
- What we got? What we got?

01:56.784 --> 01:59.051
- Holy hell!
- Oh, man.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.020
- Daggone!
- [Bill] Son of a bitch!

02:03.356 --> 02:05.390
That's a lot of blood, boys.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.227
<i>[Buck] Dude, look at all
this blood.</i>

02:11.431 --> 02:13.031
<i>[Willy] There's so much blood
on the ground,</i>

02:13.033 --> 02:14.633
it looks like somebody
slit the throat

02:14.635 --> 02:16.502
on a damn big-ass hog.

02:16.504 --> 02:17.769
That is a pile of blood.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.872
Look at it all up on that tree.

02:19.874 --> 02:21.840
That's a damn blood bath.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.642
If this blood come
from that pooch,

02:24.978 --> 02:27.346
that dog is not walking
this earth no more.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.815
<i>[Man] That much blood, there
should be a body somewhere.</i>

02:29.817 --> 02:30.916
Let's start looking around,

02:30.918 --> 02:32.718
see if we can find any remains.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.953
- Maybe look down, see which--
- No, no.

02:36.222 --> 02:37.589
What's wrong?

02:37.591 --> 02:40.292
Guys, we got to slam
the brakes on here.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.127
We're moving way too fast.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.296
There's something I need
to talk to y'all about.

02:45.932 --> 02:47.766
But this isn't a place
to be talking.

02:49.402 --> 02:50.702
Okay.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.572
We're looking around trying
to pick back up on this trail,

02:53.574 --> 02:55.140
all of a sudden Huck tells us

02:55.142 --> 02:57.009
it's time to pump the brakes.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.277
He wants to get us
out of these woods

02:58.279 --> 02:59.378
and have a talk with us.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.480
Let's turn around.
Let's head back.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.882
- Buck, you take point.
- Let's go.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.884
I need to fill these boys in

03:05.886 --> 03:08.320
on something that happened to me

03:08.322 --> 03:11.290
that very few people
on this earth has ever heard.

03:12.425 --> 03:14.993
Something tells me that
this Grafton monster

03:14.995 --> 03:16.461
got the taste of blood tonight.

03:17.964 --> 03:20.065
And he ain't no ways near done.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.000
I got something definitely
got tuck out.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.336
- That poor little pup didn't even have a chance.
- Yeah.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.877
- Nice night so far, right?
- Oh, buddy.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.645
<i>[Buck] Tonight,
Huckleberry told us</i>

03:33.647 --> 03:35.247
<i>that he needed to fill
the rest of the team in</i>

03:35.249 --> 03:37.316
<i>on something
about the Grafton monster.</i>

03:37.318 --> 03:39.084
I don't know what's
on this man's mind,

03:39.086 --> 03:40.152
but I'm interested to hear.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.021
[Huck] Guys,
I want to tell you a story

03:44.057 --> 03:46.525
of an incident I had when I was

03:46.527 --> 03:49.461
14 years old, 1968,

03:51.497 --> 03:52.497
with the Grafton monster.

03:54.934 --> 03:55.867
Really?

03:56.903 --> 03:59.037
Uh, my dad and my uncle,

04:00.206 --> 04:02.541
they were big into hunting,
you know?

04:02.543 --> 04:04.509
And dad and my uncle
would take off

04:04.511 --> 04:05.677
and go hunting places.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.847
This time, it was different

04:08.849 --> 04:11.917
'cause they were going up
there next Grafton

04:11.919 --> 04:14.119
and I got to go with 'em.

04:14.121 --> 04:17.356
Yeah, buddy, I was walking
on air. I'm telling you.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.423
I guarantee it.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.727
We had 3 dogs

04:21.729 --> 04:25.163
and a 40-some model DeSoto.

04:25.165 --> 04:28.000
- A day or two ago.
- [Huck] Yeah.

04:28.002 --> 04:30.569
But anyway, we were
headed to Grafton County

04:30.571 --> 04:33.372
and we get up there to a
certain spot and we park.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.943
We get out, and it's starting
to get dark now.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.415
We start down out this ridge
and down this little hall

04:43.417 --> 04:46.285
- and all of a sudden the dogs start carrying on.
- [dogs howling]

04:46.287 --> 04:48.453
- Got a scent of something.
- [Huck] Yeah.

04:48.455 --> 04:52.057
We get out there
and just on out the ridge

04:52.059 --> 04:53.792
from us and up on the hill
a little bit,

04:55.728 --> 04:58.230
they're carrying on and
we come up this rock cliff

04:58.232 --> 05:01.600
and there's this
great big opening.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.101
And my uncle, he had no sense

05:03.103 --> 05:07.506
and no... no fear of anything,
probably, I thought.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.241
He crawled back up in there
and all of a sudden

05:09.243 --> 05:12.577
you could hear this racket
where he's coming out.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.113
He got turned around
and started to back out there.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.748
And when he come
to the edge of that,

05:16.750 --> 05:18.083
he looked at my dad and he said,

05:18.085 --> 05:19.785
"We need to get them dogs
and get out of here."

05:21.854 --> 05:23.855
And it wasn't

05:25.558 --> 05:26.858
five seconds after that

05:28.094 --> 05:31.196
up on top of this
20, 30-foot rock cliff,

05:31.198 --> 05:35.600
this bellow just rang down
through these hollers.

05:39.038 --> 05:40.572
It just shook you.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.908
I mean, it literally shook me.

05:46.479 --> 05:50.115
This thing jumped off
this rock face.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.783
And as it's coming down,

05:51.785 --> 05:53.785
it's breaking
the limbs off the trees.

05:55.254 --> 05:58.056
It hits the ground, and
this son of a bitch come up

05:58.058 --> 06:01.560
on its hind legs,
standing upright.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.264
And they keep telling me
to get this light on it.

06:07.633 --> 06:10.969
You gotta keep in mind,
this is about 1968.

06:10.971 --> 06:14.072
You didn't have these little
flashlights like we got now.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.975
Me, I had one of them
great big ol'

06:16.977 --> 06:20.145
six-volt heavy metal
railroad liners.

06:20.147 --> 06:23.482
[laughter]

06:23.484 --> 06:25.484
Okay?

06:25.486 --> 06:28.453
I finally got settled down
enough that I got that light shined

06:28.455 --> 06:31.490
on this thing and I made
eye contact with it, guys.

06:31.492 --> 06:34.593
And it's no farther
than 30 yards.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.764
I watched the muscles
in its chest,

06:38.766 --> 06:42.067
I watched the muscles
in its stomach, its legs.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.136
I couldn't move.
It paralyzed me.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.307
Meantime, two of them dogs,
they come hightailing

06:49.309 --> 06:51.576
past me, their tail
between their legs

06:51.578 --> 06:54.846
and they never slowed down.
They went right on by me.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.149
- Scared to death.
- Yeah.

06:57.151 --> 06:59.084
We had a Bluetick named Bo.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.019
And he was a hell of a dog,
buddy.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.355
He wasn't afraid of nothing.

07:03.357 --> 07:04.990
He'd stand his ground,

07:04.992 --> 07:07.759
and he hit that big bastard
with everything he had.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.227
Wow.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.430
I mean, he's gnawing
and biting wherever

07:11.432 --> 07:12.798
he can get a hold of.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.434
And this creature's making
some kind of...

07:15.436 --> 07:18.036
it wasn't a bellow,
but it was like anger.

07:20.006 --> 07:22.474
Just pure evil anger in it.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.180
And my dad said, "It's time
to go. Get to the car.

07:28.182 --> 07:30.582
We'll be right behind you."

07:30.584 --> 07:31.616
So I take off.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.419
And I managed getting
in this car

07:34.421 --> 07:36.087
and I can remember
hearing this dog

07:37.223 --> 07:38.824
just giving everything he had.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.226
And all of a sudden,
this most pitiful sound

07:41.228 --> 07:44.329
I've ever heard
in my entire life

07:44.331 --> 07:46.565
just went through the woods.

07:50.002 --> 07:51.369
You have to hang on here, guys,

07:51.371 --> 07:55.040
because this is where it
really gets rough for me.

07:59.779 --> 08:03.215
We get down there where
we'd last seen Bo

08:03.217 --> 08:04.516
and this creature into it.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.352
And there's an area
there that's just

08:08.988 --> 08:11.122
kicked up, wiped out everything.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.324
Tore all to pieces.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.626
And then I get to looking
around, I start over,

08:14.628 --> 08:16.394
and Dad said,
"No, don't come down here."

08:18.097 --> 08:20.765
Of course, me being
a young, dumb kid,

08:21.934 --> 08:22.934
I went down there.

08:24.203 --> 08:25.837
And I wish to God
I'd never seen it.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.545
We found parts of Bo.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.517
His intestines...

08:39.952 --> 08:41.887
was hanging in a tree.

08:46.259 --> 08:49.227
One leg had been torn off,

08:49.229 --> 08:50.762
the hide had been peeled back,

08:52.632 --> 08:54.332
and there were bite marks in it.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.934
Wow.
Man!

08:59.739 --> 09:02.207
We never did find
the rest of him.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.545
But there's no doubt in my mind

09:06.547 --> 09:09.514
that Bo sacrificed himself

09:09.516 --> 09:11.917
so we could get out of there.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.853
- Hell yes.
- To this day, I believe that wholeheartedly.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.123
This Grafton monster

09:19.425 --> 09:20.625
is a force of nature.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.897
And I hope to God

09:25.899 --> 09:28.533
that we take as many men
out of this woods

09:28.535 --> 09:29.634
as we put in there.

09:32.038 --> 09:34.539
<i>[Bill] Huckleberry,
this man is marine.</i>

09:34.541 --> 09:36.775
<i>And by God, to see him shook up,</i>

09:36.777 --> 09:39.044
the son of a bitch
Grafton monster

09:39.046 --> 09:41.713
is a vicious son of a bitch.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.583
[Huck] The reason I wanted
to tell you guys that story

09:44.585 --> 09:46.718
is 'cause we're getting
way too loose.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.154
We're letting too much
[bleep] slide by.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.455
What do you mean?

09:50.457 --> 09:52.424
There's something that
we've been overlooking

09:52.426 --> 09:53.558
since we've been back here,

09:54.660 --> 09:56.428
right in front of our faces

09:56.430 --> 09:58.063
and we're missing it.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.231
- What's that?
- You guys wanna see it?

10:01.200 --> 10:02.200
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.270
It's sitting right
in the bed of my truck.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.874
All right, what do you got?

10:09.876 --> 10:11.509
What are you keeping
from us, Huck?

10:11.511 --> 10:14.212
What in the world do you got
in the back of your truck?

10:15.548 --> 10:17.515
[Huck] You guys ready to take
a walk?

10:17.517 --> 10:18.717
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.784
Oh, yeah.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.354
Let's go to my truck, huh?

10:22.356 --> 10:23.989
[Buck]
<i>We're in the Tygart Valley,</i>

10:23.991 --> 10:27.092
<i>we're on the tail of the
legendary Grafton monster.</i>

10:27.094 --> 10:28.360
<i>Huck just told us</i>

10:28.362 --> 10:30.528
that there's been things
right in front of our face,

10:30.530 --> 10:31.830
things we've been missing.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.632
Get around here
to back of my truck.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.333
[Buck] What you got, Huck?

10:35.335 --> 10:37.235
He said that he has
something in his truck

10:37.237 --> 10:38.703
that we need to see.

10:38.705 --> 10:41.106
I don't know what he's got,
but I'm anxious to see it.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.010
<i>[Huck] We've been missing
a lot of things here.</i>

10:45.012 --> 10:48.747
For example,
the Grafton monster,

10:48.749 --> 10:50.915
- it's been here all along.
- Oh, yeah.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.851
We've been so focused on Bigfoot

10:52.853 --> 10:54.252
- that we've overlooked it.
- Yeah.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.021
Just overlooked, yup.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.456
And there's other things
that we've overlooked.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.458
- Like what?
- Yeah, like what?

11:00.460 --> 11:02.994
Just hang on a minute,
let me get it.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.663
Huck just brought up
a great point.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.031
Oh, he's on to something.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.233
<i>[Buck] We missed that
the Grafton monster was here</i>

11:08.235 --> 11:10.402
<i>in the Tygart Valley
the first time we was here.</i>

11:10.404 --> 11:12.437
What else have we been missin'?

11:12.439 --> 11:15.040
You remember when
Trapper's daughter Laura

11:15.042 --> 11:17.842
gave us this box to bring
back to the Tygart Valley?

11:17.844 --> 11:19.844
- [Buck] Oh, yeah.
- Hell yes.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.514
The night before we came
back to Tygart Valley,

11:22.516 --> 11:24.149
we met up with Laura.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.184
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

11:26.186 --> 11:28.486
<i>[Huck] She give us
an old shoeshine box</i>

11:28.488 --> 11:30.321
full of Trapper's old stuff.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.223
I'm gonna give this box
to all of you

11:32.225 --> 11:33.625
and I want you to take up

11:33.627 --> 11:35.627
whatever dad was doing
in Tygart Valley

11:35.629 --> 11:36.961
and figure it out for me.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.231
<i>[Huck] There was a watch,
a compass,</i>

11:40.233 --> 11:42.067
<i>all sorts of random things.</i>

11:42.069 --> 11:43.334
Couple harmonicas.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.170
<i>[Huck] And we believe this box</i>

11:45.172 --> 11:47.505
is tied to our investigation.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.174
We believe this box

11:49.176 --> 11:51.042
is tied to the Tygart Valley

11:51.044 --> 11:53.144
because of the photo
that was in it.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.380
<i>- [Buck] Oh, yeah, absolutely.
- [Bill] Yeah.</i>

11:55.382 --> 11:56.548
<i>That's a picture of Trapper</i>

11:56.550 --> 11:58.216
<i>right by the Tygart Valley sign.</i>

11:58.218 --> 12:00.018
- Damn right.
- Hell yes.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.287
Inside this box,

12:02.289 --> 12:04.456
there was one other thing
that caught my eye.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.324
- What's that?
- Yeah, what was it?

12:08.427 --> 12:10.295
Was this.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.629
A dog collar.

12:11.631 --> 12:14.966
- Big ass dog collar.
- [Jeff] Well, that's weird.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.334
What does that tag say?

12:16.336 --> 12:18.136
Says Gus.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.504
- Gus.
- Gus.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.173
- [Buck] Don't remember no damn Gus.
- [Huck] No.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.109
Huck just pulled out
an old dog collar

12:24.111 --> 12:26.478
that was in that box
that says Gus.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.714
<i>None of us remember Trapper
having a dog named Gus.</i>

12:29.716 --> 12:33.084
Trapper even has a dog
graveyard in his backyard.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.653
- Man, this dude loved his dogs, didn't he?
- Yeah.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.756
<i>[Buck] But none of the
graves are marked with Gus.</i>

12:39.525 --> 12:41.126
Who's Gus?

12:41.128 --> 12:43.228
I don't remember seeing a Gus.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.829
Me neither, Jeffro.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.364
[Huck] Exactly.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.899
Why?

12:47.901 --> 12:49.901
I'm sure there's some
reason behind it.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.537
Well, the reason
there's no grave,

12:54.340 --> 12:55.440
there's no body.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.343
Ooh.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.211
- That makes sense.
- Wow.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.846
[Buck] Huck, you may be
onto something there.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.014
We know

13:03.016 --> 13:05.183
that there's a mystery
going on in the Tygart Valley

13:05.185 --> 13:06.317
when it comes to dogs.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.086
- Oh, yes.
- [Bill] Hell yes.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.889
- We got all those dog collars we found.
- [Huck] Yeah.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.324
- Check that out.
- Look at the size of that.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.860
- [man] Dang, wow.
- Dog collar.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.295
No way.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.864
Ain't safe being a dog
in this neighborhood.

13:19.866 --> 13:22.567
Why was that dog collar
in that box?

13:22.569 --> 13:24.569
<i>Did Trapper lose a dog named Gus</i>

13:24.571 --> 13:25.770
<i>to the Tygart Valley?</i>

13:27.206 --> 13:28.973
[Huck] So, I get to thinking
that maybe there's more

13:28.975 --> 13:30.508
to this box than we're seeing.

13:31.944 --> 13:35.146
So, I did a little
bit of pilfering around.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.448
I noticed this here,
contact paper down here

13:37.450 --> 13:39.717
on the bottom was coming loose.

13:39.719 --> 13:40.885
- [Bill] Oh, yeah.
- [Willy] Yeah.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.954
- It is loose, ain't it?
- Yeah.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.256
And I noticed that there's
some photographs

13:45.258 --> 13:46.457
back in here.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.860
- [Bill] Really?
- [Jeff] I'll be damned. Wow.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.929
[Huck] I want you
to look at this one.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.730
- You guys see that?
- Wow.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.166
<i>[Willy] That's a big damn
drilling rig right there in the middle.</i>

13:55.168 --> 13:56.301
<i>[Huck] Yes, it is.</i>

13:56.303 --> 13:58.102
[Buck] You can see it's out
in the middle of nowhere.

13:58.104 --> 13:59.537
There ain't nothin' around.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.538
[Huck] Nothin' at all.

14:02.808 --> 14:04.175
Wow.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.444
<i>[Willy] All right, there's
a big triple drill rig.</i>

14:06.446 --> 14:08.446
Big ol' triple, yeah.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.848
Remember this photo here,

14:09.850 --> 14:11.816
<i>with Trapper
and the Tygart Valley sign?</i>

14:11.818 --> 14:12.917
- [Bill] Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

14:12.919 --> 14:14.819
Look down here
at the bottom of it.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.487
<i>- [Bill] Drill pipe.
- [Willy] Oh, yeah.</i>

14:16.489 --> 14:17.689
<i>[Bill] Wow.</i>

14:17.691 --> 14:19.691
That's definitely a drill pipe
in the bottom right there.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.392
<i>[Buck] Huck found
some old photos</i>

14:21.394 --> 14:23.962
<i>hidden in the back of that
shoeshine box.</i>

14:23.964 --> 14:25.597
Looks like there's
an old oil rig

14:25.599 --> 14:27.198
that's out
in the middle of nowhere.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.800
<i>That's for putting down
a deep hole.</i>

14:28.802 --> 14:30.368
Was Trapper out here
drilling for oil

14:30.370 --> 14:31.769
in the Tygart Valley?

14:31.771 --> 14:33.905
Well, there's one more photo

14:35.040 --> 14:36.941
that really stood out to me.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.779
Is that Trapper right there?

14:41.781 --> 14:43.147
<i>[Jeff] Yeah,
that's definitely Trapper.</i>

14:43.149 --> 14:44.315
<i>[Bill] Hell, yeah.
Sure hell is.</i>

14:44.317 --> 14:46.284
<i>That's a big old dog,
looks like...</i>

14:46.286 --> 14:47.785
That was in
the bottom of that box?

14:47.787 --> 14:48.820
Yup.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.958
- Is that Gus?
- Oh!

14:53.960 --> 14:56.327
Oh, holy [bleep].

14:56.329 --> 14:58.963
- [man] That's a big dog and that's a big collar.
- [Buck] Big chain.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.298
<i>[Bill] Damn.</i>

15:00.300 --> 15:02.033
Huck just showed us an old photo

15:02.035 --> 15:06.004
of Trapper with a big dog.
Is that Gus?

15:06.006 --> 15:08.773
<i>Somethin' tells me that
there's more to this story.</i>

15:08.775 --> 15:10.975
We've absolutely
been missing things.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.243
Hold on.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.512
- We ain't done yet.
- What do you mean?

15:14.514 --> 15:15.647
- What?
- What do you mean?

15:15.649 --> 15:17.415
Yeah, really?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.884
Trapper journals guided us
a good little ways.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.887
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.756
Absolutely, mister.

15:24.758 --> 15:28.026
Do you mind opening that up to
the first page and read it, please?

15:31.797 --> 15:32.997
Pathfinder symbol.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.702
"For every destination, there
is a right and wrong path."

15:38.837 --> 15:40.838
Would you hold it up
so everybody can see it?

15:40.840 --> 15:41.873
Absolutely.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.677
Hold it up, y'all read.

15:45.679 --> 15:48.413
When I was looking in there
and found them pictures,

15:48.415 --> 15:50.181
I found something else.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.950
Oh, what did you find?

15:51.952 --> 15:53.051
Yeah, what?

15:53.819 --> 15:54.786
This here

15:56.388 --> 15:57.722
puts her in cement, boys.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.593
- What do you got, Huck?
- What is it, Huck?

16:02.595 --> 16:03.695
What did you find?

16:05.798 --> 16:08.499
[Huck] This here,
puts her in cement, boys.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.435
What is it, Huck?

16:10.437 --> 16:12.103
This paper sticks a little bit,

16:12.105 --> 16:13.137
but I can get it out.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.444
- Oh!
- Oh, wow.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.045
Go to hell!

16:26.685 --> 16:28.019
[Buck] It's identical.

16:28.021 --> 16:30.154
Son of a bitch.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.757
Huck pulled that paper back.
And there it is,

16:32.759 --> 16:34.959
the exact same Pathfinder symbol

16:34.961 --> 16:37.929
that's right there in the
front of Trapper's journal.

16:37.931 --> 16:41.165
Somethin' tells me that this box

16:41.167 --> 16:44.335
is a hell of a lot more important
than we ever thought it was.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.371
Trapper's journal has guided us

16:46.373 --> 16:48.906
since the second we stepped
foot in the Tygart Valley

16:48.908 --> 16:50.475
and this box may do the same.

16:50.477 --> 16:54.579
Well, Huck, you found a huge piece
of the puzzle that we've been missin'.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.115
I think it's time for us to call it
a night and get on out of here.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.282
Good job, brother.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.484
- Hell ya.
- Yeah. Good job.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.953
Huck just found a huge
piece of the puzzle tonight,

17:01.955 --> 17:06.324
and something tells me that
this box with the Pathfinder symbol

17:06.326 --> 17:08.826
is gonna be the key
to this entire mystery.

17:08.828 --> 17:12.196
You knocked it out of
the park on that one one.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.867
[Buck] Trapper, my friend, seems
like you're still knocking our socks off.

17:15.869 --> 17:18.836
Even from the grave,
this man is full of surprises.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.946
<i>[Bill] I'm headed out
to meet the team.</i>

17:28.948 --> 17:33.418
Apparently, Jeffro has got some scientific
research he's going to perform today.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.186
<i>We'll check it out.</i>

17:35.188 --> 17:37.055
- There's Jeffro's truck.
- [men laughing]

17:37.057 --> 17:38.322
He got to be around here
somewhere.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.892
[Buck] Oh, yeah,
don't miss anywhere now.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.226
Gotta get me covered up.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.661
Holy hell!

17:45.197 --> 17:47.098
Hey, Bill!

17:47.100 --> 17:50.701
[laughter]

17:50.703 --> 17:52.670
What in the hell is this?

17:52.672 --> 17:54.539
It's a hillbilly hazmat suit.

17:56.341 --> 17:58.910
[laughter]

17:58.912 --> 18:01.412
[Bill] What are you
lot laughing about?

18:01.414 --> 18:04.515
<i>What? I don't know what
this has got to do with science.</i>

18:04.517 --> 18:07.785
I hope Jeffro has got some
drawers on underneath that.

18:07.787 --> 18:11.956
Jeffro looks like a Tin Man
<i>from Wizard of Oz with a beard.</i>

18:11.958 --> 18:15.726
[laughter]

18:15.728 --> 18:17.095
Oh, yeah.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.597
This has... this has got to be
better than a real hazmat suit.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.998
There ain't nothing
that can get in there.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.901
[laughter]

18:25.471 --> 18:28.673
Lookin' at Jeffro standing
there in that hazmat outfit,

18:28.675 --> 18:32.276
he looks like he ought to be
in a damn Boris Karloff movie.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.679
Houston, we have a problem.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.482
[all laughing]

18:37.484 --> 18:40.818
Jeffro, that just
[makes a noise]...

18:40.820 --> 18:43.855
Oh, we're not done yet,
guys, come on, get to work.

18:43.857 --> 18:47.091
I'm not sure why. But I
got an intense hankering

18:47.093 --> 18:48.359
for a baked tatter.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.294
[Jeff mumbling]

18:50.296 --> 18:52.730
-What is it? What?
-Get your beard out. I can't hear you.

18:52.732 --> 18:53.898
[Jeff] What?

18:53.900 --> 18:56.234
- I gotta pee.
- [all laughing]

18:56.236 --> 18:57.435
You've gotta--

18:57.437 --> 19:00.104
We finally get
Jeff all taped up.

19:00.106 --> 19:03.508
<i>Then he breaks the news to
us that he has to pee. Go figure.</i>

19:03.510 --> 19:05.743
One day the man ain't
wearin' his adult diapers.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.311
Do you want me to
let some of that out?

19:08.847 --> 19:11.782
- Carefully.
- This will be my first robot circumcision.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.985
[laughter]

19:13.987 --> 19:16.554
I am not happy that I'm the one

19:16.556 --> 19:18.589
that has to
cut a fly in this suit.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.891
You never know
what's going to happen

19:19.893 --> 19:21.726
with these old guys
and their bladder.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.528
Maybe like
popping a water balloon.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.929
[Bill] Don't... don't
flinch or nothing,

19:24.931 --> 19:26.998
- man, that knife's sharp.
- A flinch could lose an inch.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.132
Oh, yeah!

19:28.134 --> 19:31.135
[all laughing]

19:32.037 --> 19:33.838
He wouldn't have
more room to go.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.107
[all laughing]

19:36.109 --> 19:37.208
- Oh.
- Please don't cut it.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.477
[Buck speaking]

19:39.479 --> 19:42.079
[laughter]

19:44.449 --> 19:46.417
Hey, duct tape fixes everything.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.352
<i>But if Jeff doesn't hold still,</i>

19:48.354 --> 19:50.354
duct tape's gonna be what's
holding his wiener together.

19:52.624 --> 19:54.759
-[Buck] Deep breaths, Jeffro.
-Squeeze my hand. Squeeze my hand.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.460
- Deep breaths.
- There you go.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.496
All right, I'll be right back.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.798
- Okay.
- Just let it flow.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.167
Don't go too far.

20:03.169 --> 20:06.904
Jeffro wasn't BSing about
having to take a whiz.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.272
<i>When Buck cut that hole up,</i>

20:08.340 --> 20:11.909
<i>looked like somebody opened
a fire hydrant up wide open.</i>

20:11.911 --> 20:14.879
Looks like
Old Faithful gushing out.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.814
Look at him.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.550
[all laughing]

20:19.552 --> 20:22.186
He got more on his boots
than he did on the damn ground.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.756
Look at his boot,
look at his boot.

20:27.326 --> 20:30.361
The man takes the "AIM"
out of the AIMS team.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.230
Okay, you guys, fill me in.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.831
What's up with
the hillbilly hazmat suit?

20:36.735 --> 20:39.937
We need the suit because
we're gonna be doing blood work.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.606
- Blood work?
- [Jeff] Yeah.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.141
It's pretty clear
there's something goin' on

20:44.143 --> 20:46.577
out here in the Tygart Valley
when it comes to dogs.

20:46.579 --> 20:50.081
And we think something may have
happened to Trapper's dog Gus.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.618
We have something we need
to test to see if it's got blood on it.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.119
<i>The team found a dog collar</i>

20:55.121 --> 20:57.655
out there by that tree
structure in those rock piles.

20:57.657 --> 20:58.723
Dog collar.

20:58.725 --> 20:59.857
No way.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.459
And we also have that dog collar

21:01.461 --> 21:04.095
that Huck found in
Trapper's old shoeshine box.

21:05.297 --> 21:09.166
Jeff has a great way
to test for blood.

21:09.168 --> 21:12.536
So today, we want to run an
experiment on those dog collars

21:12.538 --> 21:15.139
and see if we can find out
a little bit more information.

21:15.141 --> 21:18.509
Did you know when you put
hydrogen peroxide on blood, it'll boil up?

21:18.511 --> 21:19.777
No.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.446
Yeah. It'll foam up
like a volcano.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.481
- No kidding.
- [Buck] Yeah.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.082
- [Jeff] Yeah.
- That's why we need the suit.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.617
Don't want to get
no blood on him.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.419
- Genius idea.
- [Buck] Yeah.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.621
Jeff told us he has a test

21:30.623 --> 21:33.224
that can show us
if there's blood on anything,

21:33.226 --> 21:34.525
we have to see this.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.527
[Jeff] Oh, yeah.

21:36.529 --> 21:39.563
When we put the hydrogen
peroxide to this blood,

21:39.565 --> 21:42.300
it'll probably foam up clear
over the side of this plate.

21:42.302 --> 21:43.367
Jeez

21:43.369 --> 21:45.369
The AIMS team
is getting into forensics.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.004
Ain't nobody safe.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.707
- Let's do it, I want you to see this.
- Yeah. Let's do it.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.509
[Buck] Okay, here we go.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.077
[Bill] Holy moly!

21:53.079 --> 21:57.214
-Put it through, Bill. Squeeze it, man.
-Good Lord! Look at that.

21:57.216 --> 22:00.084
- [all hollering]
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

22:00.086 --> 22:04.255
-Jeffro, yeah! Look at that.
-Look at that!

22:04.257 --> 22:07.391
<i>[Huck] As soon as Bill put
that peroxide on that blood,</i>

22:07.393 --> 22:11.262
it just boiled up like you had too
much laundry detergent in a washer.

22:11.264 --> 22:12.330
- Wow!
- Look at that.

22:12.332 --> 22:13.631
There's a little face
right there,

22:13.633 --> 22:14.732
looks like Huckleberry.

22:17.035 --> 22:18.469
[Huck]
<i>There's no doubt about it.</i>

22:18.471 --> 22:22.273
This here hillbilly science,
it damn well worked.

22:22.275 --> 22:25.743
This one right here is the
one we found the other night.

22:25.745 --> 22:26.944
And you can see right there,

22:26.946 --> 22:29.113
see all them stains
and stuff on it right there.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.981
I wanna definitely
test this for blood.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.149
Look at that right there.

22:32.151 --> 22:33.784
[Huck]
Something all over buckle.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.486
- Looks like it, doesn't it?
- [Huck] Yeah.

22:35.488 --> 22:38.289
We're gonna test two
different dog collars for blood.

22:38.291 --> 22:40.591
We're gonna scrape it
a little bit on this slide

22:40.593 --> 22:42.760
and then we're gonna put
the peroxide on the slide.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.695
The first one is the one
the team found out there

22:44.697 --> 22:46.497
by that tree structure
in those rock piles.

22:46.499 --> 22:47.998
[Bill]
That definitely looks like

22:48.000 --> 22:50.568
- dried blood to me right there.
- Oh, yeah.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.570
[Huck] We'll know here
in a little bit, Bill.

22:52.572 --> 22:55.973
Guys, this is hillbilly CSI.

22:55.975 --> 22:58.843
- [laughter]
- Hell yeah.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.010
First hand.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.012
You think that's enough, Jeffro?

23:02.014 --> 23:03.647
- Oh, I'm sure of it.
- [Bill] Oh, wow.

23:03.649 --> 23:04.715
Let me put some on there.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.550
I got a eyedropper
of it right here.

23:06.552 --> 23:07.918
- You guys ready?
- [Bill] Yeah!

23:07.920 --> 23:10.488
- [Buck] Yeah.
- [Bill] Give her a spin.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.323
[Jeff] And this will tell
right here.

23:17.496 --> 23:18.963
Is it doing anything at all?

23:18.965 --> 23:20.598
- Ain't doing anything.
- No.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.501
When Jeff put the peroxide
on that first dog collar,

23:23.503 --> 23:25.970
nothing. It looked
like it had blood on it,

23:25.972 --> 23:28.139
but it could've been rust
or it could've been mud.

23:28.141 --> 23:30.808
This one right here,
out of Pathfinder box now.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.910
Now, we need to
test Gus's collar

23:32.912 --> 23:34.278
from Trapper's Pathfinder box.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.648
What happened to you, Gus?

23:37.650 --> 23:39.884
Yeah, what did happen to you?

23:39.886 --> 23:42.453
[Huck] Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's good.

23:42.455 --> 23:43.554
Do it, Jeffro.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.089
- [Jeff] You guys ready?
- [Bill] Yeah, do it.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.190
- [Willy] Yeah.
- [Buck] Hell yeah.

23:46.192 --> 23:47.425
[Jeff] Here we go.

23:51.363 --> 23:53.964
- [Willy] Oh, yeah!
- [Bill] Holy hell, it's foaming.

23:53.966 --> 23:54.999
It's foaming.

23:55.001 --> 23:56.434
- Yeah.
- Cha-ching!

23:56.436 --> 23:57.635
That's blood.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.570
[Bill]
Damn right that's blood.

23:59.572 --> 24:02.606
Let's put some of that hydrogen
peroxide right on that collar.

24:02.608 --> 24:03.641
Here. Let me have it.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.610
All right, Bill.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.746
All right, here we go.

24:08.748 --> 24:13.184
- [Buck] Oh.
- [Bill] Holy [bleep], look at that.

24:13.186 --> 24:14.952
- Daggone!
- [Bill] Look at that, boys.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.487
[Huck] Damn.

24:16.489 --> 24:20.324
- Look at that right there.
- Man!

24:20.326 --> 24:23.394
There's no doubt that
that's blood right there.

24:23.396 --> 24:24.929
What happened to you, Gus?

24:24.931 --> 24:28.365
<i>[Huck] Seeing that peroxide
foam up on that collar,</i>

24:28.367 --> 24:30.501
<i>that tells me
there's a lot of blood on it?</i>

24:30.503 --> 24:34.538
Poor old Gus, he met a
hell of a bloody ending.

24:34.540 --> 24:36.340
I don't know what this means,

24:36.342 --> 24:38.209
but it's looking like to me

24:38.211 --> 24:41.078
Trapper's dog Gus got killed.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.848
- [Jeff] Oh, yeah.
- [Bill] Yeah. And if I'm a betting man,

24:45.016 --> 24:47.451
I'd bet it happened
right here in Tygart Valley.

24:47.453 --> 24:49.753
- I'd tell you you're right.
- [Huck] Yeah, Bill.

24:49.755 --> 24:52.890
Ol' Gus is talking to us
and he doesn't even know it.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.492
[Huck] Man.

24:54.494 --> 24:57.862
There's something damn well
strange going on with these canines.

24:57.864 --> 25:00.965
<i>And this same scene, we'll
get to damn bottom of it.</i>

25:03.768 --> 25:06.003
- [Willy] That must be him.
- [Huck] Yeah.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.405
<i>Today, we're getting ready to
meet up with an eyewitness witness</i>

25:08.407 --> 25:10.574
<i>that Jeff set up.
His name's Brad.</i>

25:10.576 --> 25:12.209
Hey, how you doing? Hey?

25:12.211 --> 25:16.113
Jeff said that Brad has over 150
acres out here in the Tygart Valley.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.748
- [Willy] I'm Willy.
- [Brad] Nice to meet you.

25:17.750 --> 25:21.452
<i>[Huck] We're hopin' that Brad can
shine some light on this Grafton monster</i>

25:21.454 --> 25:24.488
that we're after and
help us catch this bastard.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.056
Brad, I'm just
gonna start right off.

25:26.058 --> 25:28.626
I think you would fit in great
with this crew, with the hat,

25:28.628 --> 25:30.361
the beard, the bibs.

25:30.363 --> 25:32.997
Honestly, you look better
in bibs than these two.

25:32.999 --> 25:35.566
Well, it doesn't take much.
You taking applications?

25:35.568 --> 25:37.535
[all laughing]

25:39.104 --> 25:41.472
I don't know. I don't
know if he's big enough.

25:41.474 --> 25:43.807
Buddy, if I was any bigger,
it'd take three of you to see me.

25:43.809 --> 25:47.745
- [laughter]
- Damn!

25:47.747 --> 25:50.047
Wow.
Yeah, you got a point there.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.415
You'd fit right in, bud.

25:51.417 --> 25:53.117
- I guarantee.
- [laughter]

25:54.920 --> 25:56.720
[Buck] Brad, the reason
we're out here today

25:56.722 --> 25:59.623
is we're on a hot lead going
after the Grafton monster.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.725
- Yes, sir.
- We've got two

26:01.727 --> 26:05.396
potential hot spots
right here close by.

26:05.398 --> 26:07.731
One, back this way,

26:07.733 --> 26:09.733
we found
a massive tree structure,

26:11.636 --> 26:13.337
some big rock piles.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.207
Man, we have heard

26:17.209 --> 26:19.510
the loudest bellow you've
ever heard in your life.

26:19.512 --> 26:20.744
[guttural bellowing]

26:20.746 --> 26:21.779
Oh!

26:23.515 --> 26:25.516
Listen to that.

26:25.518 --> 26:26.617
Oh, yeah.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.519
But then you had
the backside of your farm

26:28.521 --> 26:29.787
where the other day

26:29.789 --> 26:31.021
- these guys heard...
- [Brad] Yeah.

26:31.023 --> 26:34.158
- What sounded like a dog getting mutilated?
- [Jeff] Yeah.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.427
-[dog whining] -Something's
[bleep] that dog up, man.

26:36.429 --> 26:38.062
So, that brings us to you.

26:38.064 --> 26:40.831
We're trying to find out
everything we can

26:40.833 --> 26:43.767
about what's happening back
on your side of the property.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.504
Well, that's what I was afraid
you all were here about.

26:47.506 --> 26:49.173
Now, let me tell you,

26:49.175 --> 26:51.141
this has been going on
for a long time.

26:52.344 --> 26:55.412
My dad told me a story
about this whenever I was a kid

26:55.414 --> 26:57.915
and I thought he was
just making things up,

26:57.917 --> 27:00.584
but he had a friend
named Ron Goldschmidt

27:00.586 --> 27:02.886
that would come out here and
ride his dirt bike on the farm.

27:02.888 --> 27:05.956
He always had a 250
enduro dirt bike he rode.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.091
Things that scoot.

27:07.093 --> 27:09.627
They would move now,
I'm telling you.

27:09.629 --> 27:12.296
And as you see, we keep
these fence lines cleared off

27:12.298 --> 27:15.933
we can see if there's any breaks
in the fence and he would just ride

27:15.935 --> 27:18.302
his dirt bike around
the perimeter of the farm.

27:18.304 --> 27:23.440
Well, it was mid to late '60s.

27:23.442 --> 27:25.976
He was out here.
It was dark evening

27:25.978 --> 27:28.379
and he came off at this point
right across the next hill

27:28.381 --> 27:30.681
and down into this
bottom of the second one

27:30.683 --> 27:32.216
and that puts you
at the bottom of that hill.

27:33.518 --> 27:36.920
He started up it
and his headlights, he said,

27:36.922 --> 27:39.223
it just hit this creature.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.558
- What did it look like?
- It was between six-and-a-half

27:41.560 --> 27:42.693
and seven feet tall.

27:42.695 --> 27:45.362
He said it was
as broad as it was wide.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.031
And he couldn't tell
if it had a head.

27:47.033 --> 27:49.199
It's almost like its head
was hunkered down

27:49.201 --> 27:50.801
in front of his chest or like...

27:50.803 --> 27:54.204
like its head was at his chest,
but his eyes were right here.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.073
- Wow.
- [Willy] Jeez.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.341
[Bill] Damn.

27:57.343 --> 28:00.277
The story that Brad is telling
about this Ron Goldschmidt

28:00.279 --> 28:02.680
sounds exactly like
the very first encounter

28:02.682 --> 28:04.648
with the Grafton monster
back in 1964.

28:06.785 --> 28:10.387
So, as soon as he hit the bottom of
that hill and started up, his headlight

28:10.389 --> 28:12.823
- hit this big creature.
- Yeah. Yeah.

28:12.825 --> 28:14.825
There's something
about a beam of light

28:14.827 --> 28:16.727
hitting this Grafton monster.

28:16.729 --> 28:18.629
Even Huck, his story

28:18.631 --> 28:21.031
he had a big spotlight and put
it right on the Grafton monster.

28:21.033 --> 28:25.703
I got that light shined on this thing
and I made eye contact with it, guys.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.404
I couldn't move.
It paralyzed me.

28:28.406 --> 28:30.307
Some things are starting
to come together here.

28:30.309 --> 28:34.078
Well, let me tell you, I always
thought it was a bunch of hooey.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.813
I never believed it

28:35.815 --> 28:39.083
until I was back there one night
I went down this very same path

28:39.085 --> 28:42.086
checking fence,
and I was on the four-wheeler

28:42.088 --> 28:45.122
and I came up over the top of that
next hill and down the other side.

28:46.291 --> 28:47.891
[Brad sighs]

28:47.893 --> 28:49.960
Whenever,
I started up the next side,

28:49.962 --> 28:52.129
my headlights
hit that same creature.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.098
- So, you saw it?
- I saw it.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.200
I wish I wouldn't have,
but I saw it.

28:56.202 --> 29:00.337
-What did it look like?
-It was about seven... seven feet tall.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.873
It was as wide as it was tall.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.142
And it was, it just...
it had... It was dark.

29:05.144 --> 29:08.212
It was real dark haired.

29:08.214 --> 29:11.148
- What color did you say it was?
- It was like almost black.

29:14.219 --> 29:17.354
- Did you lock eyes with it?
- I locked eyes with it, but it didn't look at me.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.323
It looked into my soul.

29:19.325 --> 29:20.691
Oh, damn.

29:20.693 --> 29:23.961
Lookin' at Brad, you can
tell he's damn well shook up.

29:23.963 --> 29:27.598
And I gotta admit, it's taken
me back to my encounter.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.800
It scared me. I've never
been that scared in my life,

29:29.802 --> 29:31.268
and I'm not scared of anything.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.570
There's no way to
explain how you feel

29:33.572 --> 29:37.007
till you come face to face
with this big son of a bitch

29:37.009 --> 29:38.942
and you see him
and you smell him,

29:38.944 --> 29:41.645
then you'll
damn well understand.

29:41.647 --> 29:44.848
And I'll tell you, these teenagers
in town since that happened,

29:44.850 --> 29:46.984
what I told you about Ron.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.519
It got... word got
around town.

29:48.521 --> 29:50.287
It's like a rite of passage now.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.289
These kids go out
there on that hill

29:52.291 --> 29:53.791
and they stand out there
and hoot and holler

29:53.793 --> 29:55.058
and shine lights up that hill

29:55.060 --> 29:56.827
and try to get...
get it to come after.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.095
And I'll tell you, I went there

29:58.097 --> 29:59.930
and I posted all the way
around that hill,

29:59.932 --> 30:03.400
you know, I put out no
trespassing signs, keep out,

30:03.402 --> 30:05.435
- and they still won't listen to it.
- Wow.

30:05.437 --> 30:07.337
It's like they have
a death wish.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.739
We know how teenagers are.

30:08.741 --> 30:11.074
- You tell 'em... you tell 'em not to do something...
- Absolutely.

30:11.076 --> 30:13.644
- they're gonna break their neck doing it.
- Absolutely.

30:13.646 --> 30:16.413
Brad's telling us that apparently
it's like a rite of passage

30:16.415 --> 30:18.448
for these young kids to come out

30:18.450 --> 30:20.450
and try to go up
Goldschmidt Hill

30:20.452 --> 30:23.086
<i>and see if they can see the
legendary Grafton monster.</i>

30:23.088 --> 30:25.088
<i>These kids don't know what
they're getting themselves into.</i>

30:25.090 --> 30:26.290
This is dangerous.

30:26.292 --> 30:27.658
But I understand.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.027
I still haven't grown out of that
phase where I do dumb stuff.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.129
So, you're saying this is
called Goldschmidt Hill.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.831
It's called Goldschmidt Hill.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.499
Where's that at from here?

30:35.501 --> 30:37.835
Well, if you follow
this fence line right here,

30:37.837 --> 30:39.303
all the way to
the bottom of this hill

30:39.305 --> 30:41.471
and up over the next ridge,

30:41.473 --> 30:43.740
you'll come straight down
the other side to a creek.

30:43.742 --> 30:45.609
When you get to that creek,

30:45.611 --> 30:48.445
you'll see the next hill
side start up and that's it.

30:48.447 --> 30:49.847
That's pretty far piece.

30:49.849 --> 30:51.148
It's pretty far.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.417
It's as... this is as
close as I wanna get.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.953
Now, I will tell you, when you get
over there, you'll know you're there

30:55.955 --> 30:57.321
because some of the locals,

30:57.323 --> 30:59.156
they put up a sign down there,

30:59.158 --> 31:01.692
says
the Legend of Ron Goldschmidt.

31:01.694 --> 31:04.161
- Legend of Ron Goldschmidt, huh?
- Yeah.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.663
Brad said that over the years,
somebody has put up a sign,

31:06.665 --> 31:08.932
the Legend of Ron Goldschmidt.

31:08.934 --> 31:10.033
We find that sign.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.102
We're gonna be right exactly
where we need to be.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.872
Well, guys, it sounds like
to me, we need to head out

31:14.874 --> 31:16.874
and see if we can't
find Goldschmidt Hill.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.609
- Yeah.
- [Buck] Hell yeah.

31:18.611 --> 31:21.945
Our next step, is trying to
find this Ron Goldschmidt Hill.

31:21.947 --> 31:23.480
That's where we're going
to get some answers.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.415
- We appreciate everything, Brad.
- Yeah.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.951
- You take care and we'll be in touch.
- Thank you, Brad. Yeah.

31:27.953 --> 31:29.553
[Huck]
<i>Legend of Ron Goldschmidt.</i>

31:29.555 --> 31:32.356
[Bill] Thing is,
we better be damn careful.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.358
[Bill speaking]

31:37.161 --> 31:38.829
Pop, your head can come off.

31:38.831 --> 31:42.666
[Bill] Put some motor to it. Let's see if
we can't go find this Goldschmidt Hill.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.035
<i>[Jeff] Listen, listen.</i>

31:45.037 --> 31:47.271
[crickets chirping]

31:49.407 --> 31:51.041
Hear how quiet it is.

31:51.043 --> 31:53.176
[Huck] Yeah.
It's almost painful.

31:53.945 --> 31:54.845
[Buck] Well,

31:55.780 --> 31:57.648
Wild Bill's not here.

31:57.650 --> 31:58.782
No.

31:58.784 --> 32:01.218
Tonight, Wild Bill came up sick

32:01.220 --> 32:03.053
and I told him he needs to rest.

32:03.055 --> 32:05.122
I think this will be

32:05.124 --> 32:06.723
the quietest
first night investigation

32:06.725 --> 32:07.991
we've ever done.

32:08.526 --> 32:09.860
[laughter]

32:12.330 --> 32:14.031
I would have to agree with you.

32:14.033 --> 32:15.399
So hopefully, tomorrow,

32:15.401 --> 32:17.000
he'll be back on the hunt.

32:17.002 --> 32:19.836
But here's the thing. Jeff
told me that he's missing Bill.

32:19.838 --> 32:22.239
So, I figured I'd cheer him up

32:22.241 --> 32:23.807
with a couple
Wild Bill impressions.

32:25.743 --> 32:26.944
Huh!

32:27.512 --> 32:28.612
Primo, bro.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.381
[laughter]

32:31.383 --> 32:32.683
We're going to
miss Bill tonight.

32:32.685 --> 32:34.851
- Ha-ha!
- [laughter]

32:36.587 --> 32:37.587
Yes, sir.

32:38.656 --> 32:40.524
<i>[Buck] But, I have a feeling</i>

32:40.526 --> 32:43.660
tonight, it's gonna
be a lot more quiet.

32:45.029 --> 32:47.264
Well, we're on a hot lead, guys.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.266
- Hell yeah.
- Damn right.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.568
Tonight, we're gonna be looking

32:51.570 --> 32:53.003
for Goldschmidt Hill.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.071
- Hell yeah.
- Yeah.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.172
[Jeff] Yeah.

32:55.174 --> 32:56.840
From what Brad told us,

32:56.842 --> 32:58.508
we go down this big holler

32:58.510 --> 33:00.077
- and we'll find a sign.
- Yeah.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.211
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:01.213 --> 33:02.813
But we need to keep in mind

33:02.815 --> 33:04.348
Grafton monster's here, guys.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.949
Oh, yeah.

33:05.951 --> 33:07.384
This thing is ferocious,

33:07.386 --> 33:08.685
We're gonna go slow.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.921
We're gonna go steady.
We're gonna go easy.

33:10.923 --> 33:12.055
- All right.
- Hell yeah.

33:12.057 --> 33:13.156
Sounds like a plan to me.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.224
All right, let's get moving.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.826
- Let's go.
- All right.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.527
<i>[Jeff] It really shouldn't
be too hard to find</i>

33:17.529 --> 33:19.563
<i>this way, the Brad
was describing it.</i>

33:19.565 --> 33:21.765
<i>[Buck] According to folklore,
the Grafton monster</i>

33:21.767 --> 33:23.600
was spotted on Goldschmidt Hill

33:23.602 --> 33:24.968
back in the late '60s.

33:24.970 --> 33:27.571
<i>We believe that if
we can locate this hill,</i>

33:27.573 --> 33:29.840
that'll put us right
in the money.

33:29.842 --> 33:32.976
I tell you, Brad's got a little
bit of rough country in here.

33:32.978 --> 33:35.212
[Jeff] That's for damn sure.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.147
[Buck] Hey, check this out.
Check this out.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.315
[Willy] What you got?
Look here,

33:38.317 --> 33:40.017
it's like someone's
been digging here.

33:40.019 --> 33:41.785
Damn, what the hell is that?

33:41.787 --> 33:43.120
Damn.

33:43.122 --> 33:47.057
You know how sometimes a dog
or whatever will bury its bone and--

33:47.059 --> 33:49.793
Well, that's almost what it looks
like is a dog digging right there.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.562
Wait a minute. What did you
guys stir up? You smell that?

33:54.899 --> 33:56.633
- That smells rancid, dude.
- Yeah.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.535
Um, you know what I think it is?

33:58.537 --> 34:00.504
What?

34:00.506 --> 34:02.873
- That's cat [bleep].
- Yeah.

34:02.875 --> 34:04.975
Yeah, I'd say a bobcat
come up here

34:04.977 --> 34:07.077
and covered his [bleep].

34:08.546 --> 34:09.913
Yeah, pretty much.

34:09.915 --> 34:11.681
That's where having Wild Bill

34:11.683 --> 34:13.850
would have been real handy
right now with the super sniffer.

34:13.852 --> 34:16.520
He'd smelled it before we
started getting our hands in them.

34:16.522 --> 34:19.523
That nose of his would've pulled
it right up out of the ground, bud.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.358
[twigs snapping]

34:21.360 --> 34:23.927
- [Buck] Listen, listen.
- [Huck] Ready, stay ready.

34:23.929 --> 34:25.529
What the hell was that?

34:25.531 --> 34:27.064
- [Buck] You hear that?
- Yeah, I heard it.

34:27.066 --> 34:28.965
It sounds like something's
walking right through there,

34:28.967 --> 34:30.934
- right through there.
- [Jeff] Right.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.736
- [Buck] Oh, yeah.
- [Jeff] Hold up, hold up.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.671
What do you got?
What do you got?

34:34.673 --> 34:36.239
Let me make sure.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.208
You see that right there?

34:38.210 --> 34:39.609
<i>[Buck] Oh, I see it, I see it.</i>

34:40.745 --> 34:42.579
- Right about there, Jeff?
- [Jeff] That's it.

34:42.581 --> 34:43.647
How far out, Jeff?

34:43.649 --> 34:45.415
- Seventy yards.
- [Buck] Okay.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.551
Jeffro just spotted
something on the thermal.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.319
Sounds like it was
right up through here.

34:49.321 --> 34:50.387
<i>[Huck] Jeffro and Willy.</i>

34:50.389 --> 34:51.688
<i>They're going around one side.</i>

34:51.690 --> 34:53.590
Watch your step right
here, watch your step.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.959
<i>[Huck] Buck and me, we're
going up the other side.</i>

34:55.961 --> 34:58.728
Hopefully, we can lay eyes
on this son of a bitch.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.530
<i>That son of a bitch
comes out on us,</i>

35:00.532 --> 35:02.232
<i>all hell's breaking loose.</i>

35:02.234 --> 35:04.234
<i>We need to take our damn time.</i>

35:04.236 --> 35:06.069
If this is that Grafton monster

35:06.071 --> 35:07.637
and we're split up,

35:07.639 --> 35:11.208
this would be worse than walking face
first right into a big ol' woodchipper.

35:13.177 --> 35:15.045
[Willy] Don't forget up in
the trees there too, Jeff.

35:15.047 --> 35:16.146
Okay.

35:16.148 --> 35:18.181
- Listen, listen, listen.
- Oh, man, what the heck?

35:18.183 --> 35:20.250
[distant engines rumbling]

35:21.986 --> 35:23.487
Sounds like engines.

35:23.489 --> 35:26.723
- Listen, listen, you hear that?
- Yeah.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.458
That's a motor.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.060
Hey, Buck, are you hearing this?

35:30.062 --> 35:33.130
That sounds like a couple of
four wheelers or dirt bikes.

35:33.132 --> 35:36.466
On the AIMS team, our number
one rule when we go on a hunt

35:36.468 --> 35:38.702
is to fly under the radar.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.170
<i>The last thing we need</i>

35:40.172 --> 35:41.771
is someone finding
out we're out here

35:41.773 --> 35:43.106
and ruining our hunt.

35:43.108 --> 35:44.474
[engine rumbling approaching]

35:44.476 --> 35:46.676
Listen,
they keep coming this way.

35:46.678 --> 35:49.045
Oh, crap. Hey, Willy
they're coming this way.

35:49.047 --> 35:51.248
They're coming this way. You
guys need to take cover now, now.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.383
- Come on, Willy, let's go.
- All right, we're taking cover.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.118
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on, Jeff, come on.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.586
Oh, we got lights.
We've got headlights.

35:56.588 --> 35:59.055
- Get down, get down, get down.
- Stay down, stay down.

35:59.057 --> 36:01.124
Stay down, stay down, stay down.

36:01.126 --> 36:02.626
[Jeff] Get in there.

36:02.628 --> 36:03.994
[Willy] Oh, yeah.

36:03.996 --> 36:06.163
Here take this camera, move.

36:06.165 --> 36:08.732
Stay down, stay down, stay down.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.901
-[Willy] How many you see, Jeff?
-[Jeff] I see two.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.235
[Willy] You see two?

36:12.237 --> 36:13.803
[Jeff] I see two so far.

36:15.139 --> 36:18.108
[Willy] Kind of looked
just like two, uh, riders on

36:18.110 --> 36:20.177
four wheelers, wasn't it?

36:20.179 --> 36:21.845
Yeah, we should be
good here in a minute,

36:21.847 --> 36:23.513
they just went past us.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.448
Once they clear,
we'll go ahead and get up

36:25.450 --> 36:26.783
and then we'll
just meet back up.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.585
'Cause they may have
completely screwed up our hunt.

36:28.587 --> 36:29.753
[Huck] That's for damn sure.

36:29.755 --> 36:30.921
<i>[Willy] You know what Brad said.</i>

36:30.923 --> 36:32.389
- Oh! Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- [engines stop]

36:37.728 --> 36:39.496
- They stopped.
- [Buck] They're right down there.

36:39.498 --> 36:40.797
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

36:40.799 --> 36:42.032
They just killed their engines.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.207
<i>[Buck] We're hunkered down here</i>

36:50.209 --> 36:52.876
<i>and we see these
four wheelers going by.</i>

36:52.878 --> 36:54.811
<i>I don't know what
they're doing out here.</i>

36:54.813 --> 36:56.780
But this could really
screw us up.

36:56.782 --> 36:59.449
It could be somebody out
here looking for Goldschmidt Hill.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.785
Word may be out that
we're here, can be fans.

37:01.787 --> 37:04.120
<i>Best thing we can do
is stay hunkered down,</i>

37:04.122 --> 37:05.355
fly under the radar

37:05.357 --> 37:07.557
and hopefully get back on
the hunt once they leave.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.859
Hey, Buck, did it look like
two of them to you?

37:09.861 --> 37:11.027
<i>[Buck] Yeah,
there's two of them.</i>

37:11.029 --> 37:13.563
[Buck speaking]

37:13.565 --> 37:15.432
Hey, hold up, hold up.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.567
<i>- [man 1] Randy!
- [man 2] Randy!</i>

37:17.569 --> 37:18.635
Oh.

37:19.704 --> 37:21.471
They're yelling for Randy.

37:21.473 --> 37:23.640
They probably lost one
of their buddies.

37:27.044 --> 37:28.511
<i>- [man 1] Randy!
- [man 2] Randy!</i>

37:28.513 --> 37:31.514
If they lost someone, maybe
we need to try to talk to them.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.717
We're gonna have to
help them out there, Buck.

37:33.719 --> 37:36.453
Hang on tight a second, me and
Huck's gonna try to figure this out.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.088
<i>[Buck] We can hear these guys.</i>

37:38.090 --> 37:40.190
<i>Sounds like they're
yelling for Randy.</i>

37:40.192 --> 37:42.359
I'm thinking that they may
have lost one of their buddies.

37:42.361 --> 37:45.262
- I think they went up this way, Huck.
- Yeah.

37:45.264 --> 37:47.397
<i>[Buck] Me and Huck need to
get up and work up that way</i>

37:47.399 --> 37:49.432
and see if these
guys need a hand.

37:49.434 --> 37:50.967
[Huck] Yeah. They lost one
of their buddies.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.169
Well, maybe one
of the riding buddies.

37:53.171 --> 37:54.704
- [gun fires]
- Oh! Damn.

37:56.007 --> 37:58.341
- [gun fires]
- Oh, listen to that.

37:59.844 --> 38:00.877
[gun fires]

38:02.713 --> 38:04.881
Hold up, hold up,
hold up, listen.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.117
What the hell are they
shooting at? They got a gun.

38:08.452 --> 38:09.953
<i>[Jeff] Yeah. They lost one
of their buddies.</i>

38:09.955 --> 38:11.554
Well, that may be one
of their riding buddies.

38:11.556 --> 38:13.156
- [gun fires]
- Oh, damn!

38:14.425 --> 38:16.559
- [gun fires]
- Oh, listen to that.

38:18.229 --> 38:19.262
[gun fires]

38:21.098 --> 38:23.300
Hold up, hold up,
hold up, listen.

38:23.302 --> 38:26.169
What the hell are they
shooting at? They got a gun?

38:26.171 --> 38:27.570
Hold up, Willy?

38:27.572 --> 38:29.072
You know
what that was, don't you?

38:29.074 --> 38:30.640
Three shots.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.075
After dark,

38:32.077 --> 38:33.209
when you're lost

38:33.211 --> 38:34.811
so your party can find you.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.247
- Yeah, we need to go.
- Listen. Listen, listen.

38:37.249 --> 38:38.381
They're yelling for Randy again.

38:38.383 --> 38:39.482
<i>- [man 1] Randy!
- [man 2] Randy!</i>

38:39.484 --> 38:40.583
[Huck] Yeah.

38:40.585 --> 38:42.085
Will, are you hearing this?

38:42.087 --> 38:44.154
- Yeah, I hear that.
<i>- [Buck] Well, they fired three rounds.</i>

38:44.156 --> 38:45.455
They've got someone
lost out here.

38:45.457 --> 38:46.656
[Huck] Yeah.

38:46.658 --> 38:47.724
<i>[Buck] You guys just hang tight.</i>

38:47.726 --> 38:49.125
<i>Me and Huck's going
to approach and see</i>

38:49.127 --> 38:51.161
<i>if we can make contact with
whoever these people are.</i>

38:51.163 --> 38:53.129
Out here in the Appalachia,

38:53.131 --> 38:55.865
after dark, if you
hear three gunshots,

38:55.867 --> 38:57.367
<i>it means someone's lost.</i>

38:57.369 --> 38:58.935
We've gotta stop
everything we are doing.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.704
We need to help these guys.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.707
I think those boys don't know
what the [bleep] they're up against.

39:03.709 --> 39:04.741
[Jeff] Not at all.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.515
[Willy speaking]

39:15.553 --> 39:16.753
[Jeff speaking]

39:17.788 --> 39:19.422
[Willy speaking]

39:21.025 --> 39:23.727
[Jeff] There's something
outside. You can hear it.

39:23.729 --> 39:26.563
Sounds like it weighs 500,
600, 700 pounds.

39:26.565 --> 39:29.232
- You see anything?
- No, I'm not seeing anything.

39:29.234 --> 39:30.667
<i>[Jeff] If that's
the Grafton monster,</i>

39:30.669 --> 39:32.869
he comes in here
and catches Willy and I,

39:32.871 --> 39:35.004
we might as well throw
our ass in a meat grinder

39:35.006 --> 39:36.072
at the butcher shop.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.774
We're gonna be two
hamburgers together.

39:38.943 --> 39:41.411
I keep hearing it,
but I can't see it.

39:41.413 --> 39:44.314
Well, Jeffro, we're not alone.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.584
I'll help look right here.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.252
- [Huck] Yeah.
- Listen.

39:49.254 --> 39:50.754
I hear 'em.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.622
- Still calling for Randy.
- [Buck] Yeah.

39:53.591 --> 39:55.525
Okay, I'll tell you what,
let's do,

39:56.627 --> 39:57.994
I don't wanna intimidate 'em

39:57.996 --> 39:59.729
or catch 'em off guard
or scare 'em.

40:01.999 --> 40:05.602
Why don't I leave you with
my shotgun and the radio

40:05.604 --> 40:07.904
and you just stay back here
and let me approach 'em.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.372
I've worked with juveniles

40:09.374 --> 40:11.674
for the last 16, 17 years, so.

40:11.676 --> 40:13.276
[Huck] There's no need
for both of us to go

40:13.278 --> 40:14.644
- charging in there like--
- No, no.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.479
You just hang tight here
and let me run up here

40:16.481 --> 40:17.914
and see if I can give
these guys a hand.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.015
[Huck]
I'll keep an eye on you.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.083
All right, I'll be right back.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.584
<i>[Buck] We can still hear
these guys calling</i>

40:21.586 --> 40:23.186
<i>and I see their lights
right up ahead.</i>

40:23.188 --> 40:25.188
<i>I'm gonna go up here and
see if these guys need a hand,</i>

40:25.190 --> 40:26.589
but I need to take my time.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.825
It's dark, they do have weapons,

40:28.827 --> 40:29.859
and they don't know me.

40:31.996 --> 40:33.663
- Hey.
- [Buck] You boys, all right?

40:36.834 --> 40:39.369
[man speaking]

40:39.371 --> 40:42.005
Just coming out to see if you guys
need a hand. Heard y'all yelling for Randy.

40:42.007 --> 40:44.040
Did you guys lose
one of your buddies?

40:44.042 --> 40:46.409
- What's he doing here?
- [Buck] Wow.

40:46.411 --> 40:49.512
[Huck] Holy [bleep].
This ain't starting off good.

40:49.514 --> 40:51.848
[man speaking]

40:51.850 --> 40:52.916
[Buck] Looking for a dog?

40:52.918 --> 40:54.384
[man speaking]

40:54.386 --> 40:55.518
[Buck] Well, can I help
you guys?

40:56.821 --> 40:57.954
[man 1] Nah.

40:58.656 --> 40:59.923
[Buck] Okay. I was just...

40:59.925 --> 41:01.057
[man 2]
Is there a problem here?

41:01.059 --> 41:02.459
I mean, what are you doing here?

41:02.461 --> 41:04.360
[Buck] I was just coming to
see... I could hear you guys yelling.

41:04.362 --> 41:06.029
You guys drove by me there
just a little bit ago,

41:06.031 --> 41:07.263
I heard you guys shooting.

41:07.265 --> 41:08.965
Shooting three shots up.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.567
[Buck speaking]

41:10.569 --> 41:13.069
[boy 2] Good, we're fine
so you can leave.

41:14.171 --> 41:15.605
I mean, do you have
a problem or something?

41:15.607 --> 41:18.074
Well, this is going to go
downhill real quick from now.

41:18.076 --> 41:20.977
- [Buck] Okay, take that strobe light out of my eyes.
- [man 2] No.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.745
I'm not out here trying
to fight you guys.

41:22.747 --> 41:24.681
I'm trying to see
if you need help.

41:24.683 --> 41:25.715
[Huck] Guys, stay ready.

41:28.652 --> 41:30.787
Get that light out
of my eyes, son.

41:30.789 --> 41:31.955
[man 2] No.

41:31.957 --> 41:33.456
[Buck] Okay, I'm gonna give
you one chance.

41:33.458 --> 41:35.358
-[man 2] What are you gonna do?
-[Buck] How old are you?

41:35.459 --> 41:37.126
[man speaking]

41:38.562 --> 41:39.596
Uh-oh.

41:39.598 --> 41:42.098
[man speaking]

41:43.267 --> 41:45.368
- Buck.
- Stay here.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.141
Damn it, I said stay [bleep]
here.

41:52.143 --> 41:54.077
Buck!

41:54.079 --> 41:56.346
-[Boy] Hey, who are you?
-[Huck] What the [bleep] is going on here?

41:56.348 --> 41:57.680
What the [bleep]?
