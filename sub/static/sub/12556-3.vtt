14:37.251 --> 14:41.586
YOU'RE SCARED THIS IS THE LAST JOB, SO
YOU MAKE A BIG NOISE LIKE A CONSCIENCE

14:41.672 --> 14:44.630
SO THE BIG MAN DON'T SAY YOU'VE
BEEN GOOFING OFF ALL MY LIFE.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.175

15:44.235 --> 15:47.478
THE CLASS PICNIC? THE TEACHER HAD
A LOCKET, AND THE CATCH BROKE,

15:47.572 --> 15:50.655
AND SHE LAID IT DOVVN, AND SOME OF
THE BIG KIDS DARED YOU TO SVVIPE IT.

<i>YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME WHEN THAT
PAROLE OFFICER TRIED TO HELP YOU.</i>

16:44.795 --> 16:47.958
YOU COULD HA\/E LISTENED TO HIM,

16:48.049 --> 16:50.381
SIX MONTHS LATER,
YOU WERE IN JAIL AGAIN,

16:50.468 --> 16:54.257
AND THAT PAROLE OFFICER COULDN'T HELP
YOU ANY MORE THAN JANEY REARDON COULD.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.805
