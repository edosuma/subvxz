00:43.919 --> 00:45.755
<i>Yes, hello.</i>

00:46.464 --> 00:48.299
<i>Yes, good day.</i>

00:49.592 --> 00:51.302
<i>Keep it brief, please.</i>

00:54.805 --> 00:57.391
<i>Maybe, but a consultation
at port is essential.</i>

00:57.475 --> 00:59.935
<i>In Rotterdam, of course.
Where else?</i>

01:01.479 --> 01:05.649
<i>No, I haven't had a letter
or call from him for a long time.</i>

01:06.192 --> 01:09.403
<i>Maybe his ship
is somewhere on the Atlantic.</i>

01:10.529 --> 01:12.114
<i>It's Captain Dirk.</i>

01:12.198 --> 01:14.033
<i>No, you know, Dirk.</i>

01:15.326 --> 01:16.577
<i>Yes.</i>

01:16.660 --> 01:21.207
<i>Are museums really sending out anything
in shipping containers today?</i>

01:23.042 --> 01:26.212
<i>Good. All the best.
No, we're still shooting.</i>

01:26.295 --> 01:28.714
<i>Yes, I'll see you later.
Good-bye.</i>

01:32.676 --> 01:34.553
<i>Yes, hello.</i>

01:35.429 --> 01:37.306
<i>When is
the orchestra recording?</i>

01:38.182 --> 01:39.683
<i>Yes, in Amsterdam.</i>

01:41.102 --> 01:42.895
<i>The string section?</i>

01:46.023 --> 01:47.983
<i>Check with the composer.</i>

01:48.859 --> 01:50.361
<i>All the best.</i>

02:02.915 --> 02:04.500
<i>Hi, Dirk.</i>

02:04.583 --> 02:07.044
<i>I waited for you
to make contact at last.</i>

02:08.546 --> 02:11.090
<i>I can't see you,
there's no picture.</i>

02:21.392 --> 02:24.311
<i>I'm home already,
just got back from Europe.</i>

02:29.400 --> 02:32.278
<i>Yes, my friend.
My work is almost done.</i>

02:33.279 --> 02:35.948
<i>But I don't think
the film is successful.</i>

02:37.408 --> 02:41.078
<i>I've surrounded myself with
books and talk to myself.</i>

02:57.928 --> 03:00.431
<i>Dirk? Dirk?</i>

03:00.514 --> 03:02.266
<i>The connection is gone.</i>

03:02.808 --> 03:05.186
<i>I didn't manage to ask where he is now.</i>

03:05.936 --> 03:08.105
<i>On which seas.</i>

03:17.448 --> 03:20.159
<i>Why is he looking at me like that?</i>

03:23.621 --> 03:26.624
<i>As if he knew what was awaiting us.</i>

03:28.417 --> 03:30.169
<i>Now he'll tell us.</i>

03:31.962 --> 03:33.756
<i>Who will if not him?</i>

03:41.180 --> 03:43.057
<i>Anton Pavlovich...</i>

03:46.810 --> 03:49.730
<i>You don't say he is staying silent, too?</i>

03:52.983 --> 03:54.693
<i>Now he's fallen asleep.</i>

03:54.777 --> 03:56.278
<i>He sleeps and sleeps...</i>

03:57.863 --> 04:01.617
<i>He's sleeping deeply, won't wake up soon.</i>

04:10.709 --> 04:12.211
<i>He's fallen asleep, too.</i>

04:13.003 --> 04:15.047
<i>In the hardest period...</i>

04:15.130 --> 04:18.384
<i>Mr. Chekhov! Anton Pavlovich!</i>

04:18.467 --> 04:21.220
<i>Mr. Chekhov, wake up!</i>

04:23.347 --> 04:27.559
<i>It's the dawn of the century,
the dawn of the 20th century.</i>

04:28.352 --> 04:30.271
<i>Who can I turn to?</i>

04:30.354 --> 04:31.939
<i>Who is there?</i>

04:33.524 --> 04:37.319
<i>A-ha. There are the people.</i>

04:42.700 --> 04:45.869
<i>What faces, what souls!</i>

04:47.162 --> 04:50.207
<i>Angels... children.</i>

04:51.959 --> 04:54.962
<i>But children are always hard-hearted.</i>

04:55.045 --> 04:57.923
<i>Especially when their parents are asleep.</i>

05:00.050 --> 05:05.264
<i>So that's how the 20th century started:
The fathers fell asleep.</i>

05:05.973 --> 05:07.933
<i>There she is again.</i>

05:12.062 --> 05:16.442
<i>As soon as I show up here,
you start pursuing me.</i>

05:17.735 --> 05:19.445
It's pursuit.

05:20.446 --> 05:26.452
<i>My dear ghost, tell us,
what is it that awaits us all?</i>

05:30.080 --> 05:33.167
Freedom, equality, brotherhood.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.170
<i>Freedom, equality, brotherhood.</i>

05:36.253 --> 05:40.007
<i>My dear Marianne,
I'm not in the mood for humor.</i>

05:42.551 --> 05:44.762
<i>The connection to the ship.</i>

05:51.769 --> 05:54.355
<i>You haven't responded for ages.</i>

05:54.438 --> 05:57.608
<i>We've been worried about your status.</i>

06:52.287 --> 06:55.666
Oh, it was a mistake
to take anything from the museum.

06:56.333 --> 07:00.504
It's not human,
dragging art across the oceans.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.427
Dirk? Dirk!

07:10.973 --> 07:14.768
That's it, the connection
is gone again. The sea...

07:15.727 --> 07:17.271
The ocean.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.232
I watch this and recall Chekhov:

07:20.315 --> 07:25.195
“On a huge sea,
one wave rose above the next,

07:27.197 --> 07:30.451
and they knew no sense nor pity.”

07:47.426 --> 07:55.392
<i>Elemental forces of the sea and of history
are those without sense or pity.</i>

07:59.062 --> 08:02.316
<i>What use is this ocean to me?</i>

08:02.399 --> 08:05.027
<i>Let it live its own life beside us.</i>

08:06.153 --> 08:09.406
<i>Why do we need to know
this elemental force ?</i>

08:13.911 --> 08:16.455
<i>After all, we have our cities,</i>

08:17.414 --> 08:20.417
<i>our skies, our warm and cozy apartments.</i>

08:21.376 --> 08:24.254
<i>Life, beauty...</i>

08:26.256 --> 08:29.760
<i>A people is surrounded by an ocean,</i>

08:31.386 --> 08:35.516
<i>while a person has his ocean within.</i>

08:40.729 --> 08:45.067
<i>I've been thinking
about this city a lot, lately...</i>

08:45.150 --> 08:47.736
<i>The Louvre is here somewhere.</i>

08:53.408 --> 08:57.454
<i>So where is the Louvre? I can't see it.</i>

09:01.083 --> 09:03.001
<i>Alexandre, we are ready.</i>

09:03.961 --> 09:06.296
<i>Alexandre! Alexandre!</i>

09:06.797 --> 09:08.549
<i>We are ready.</i>

09:08.632 --> 09:11.677
<i>So is the camera already rolling?</i>

09:12.511 --> 09:14.555
<i>Then let's go.</i>

09:15.514 --> 09:17.266
Sequence four, take two.

09:19.643 --> 09:24.356
<i>Calamity can strike
even the happiest city.</i>

09:24.439 --> 09:27.484
<i>In the summer of 1940,</i>

09:27.568 --> 09:31.113
<i>enemy troops entered Paris.</i>

09:32.239 --> 09:34.866
<i>This was on the 14th of June.</i>

09:35.576 --> 09:39.913
<i>The city was empty. Yes, empty.</i>

09:39.997 --> 09:42.749
<i>The government had headed south,</i>

09:42.833 --> 09:46.670
<i>declaring beautiful Paris an “open city”.</i>

09:49.381 --> 09:52.259
<i>The French are all cinematographers,</i>

09:52.342 --> 09:55.554
<i>making films regardless of the situation.</i>

10:03.353 --> 10:06.231
<i>Here we have the new owner,</i>

10:06.940 --> 10:09.943
<i>come to survey his new acquisitions.</i>

10:10.027 --> 10:13.697
<i>Is everything as it should be
and in good condition?</i>

10:14.197 --> 10:16.700
<i>But where are the subjects?</i>

10:17.993 --> 10:21.288
<i>New subjects: the neighboring people.</i>

10:24.750 --> 10:26.960
<i>Empty Paris.</i>

10:27.044 --> 10:28.962
<i>He who could, fled.</i>

10:29.046 --> 10:31.798
<i>He who could, surrendered, hid.</i>

10:31.882 --> 10:35.844
<i>Others perished
offering fierce resistance.</i>

10:45.979 --> 10:47.981
<i>Well, all right...</i>

10:48.732 --> 10:50.901
<i>The tower is where it belongs.</i>

10:50.984 --> 10:54.154
<i>Everything is well and as it should be...</i>

10:55.864 --> 10:57.574
Ah, a straight line!

10:58.241 --> 10:59.534
A straight one!

11:02.996 --> 11:04.748
But where is the Louvre?

11:08.335 --> 11:10.754
Ah! There's the Louvre!

11:10.837 --> 11:12.339
How good that it's there.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.676
It always fascinated me,
it's where it belongs.

11:15.759 --> 11:18.679
<i>Great architecture all along the line.</i>

11:20.305 --> 11:22.557
<i>The Louvre, the Louvre.</i>

11:24.643 --> 11:26.186
<i>Might it be</i>

11:26.269 --> 11:30.440
<i>that this museum
is worth more than all of France?</i>

11:32.818 --> 11:36.279
<i>Who needs France without the Louvre?</i>

11:37.656 --> 11:41.284
<i>Or Russia without the Hermitage?</i>

11:45.706 --> 11:48.291
<i>Who would we be without museums?</i>

11:50.627 --> 11:55.966
<i>It sometimes seems museums
don't care what happens around them</i>

11:56.925 --> 11:59.469
<i>as long as they're left in peace.</i>

12:03.682 --> 12:08.353
<i>Museums can also conceal
the improper behavior of power</i>

12:08.437 --> 12:10.147
<i>and of people...</i>

12:55.192 --> 12:57.569
<i>On my first visit to the Louvre,</i>

12:57.652 --> 13:01.573
<i>I was amazed by these faces.</i>

13:03.116 --> 13:05.702
<i>These are the people... the people.</i>

13:07.537 --> 13:13.251
<i>The people, as I would like to see them.</i>

13:14.628 --> 13:16.296
<i>Comprehensible to me.</i>

13:16.379 --> 13:18.465
<i>They are of their own time...</i>

13:18.548 --> 13:20.675
<i>and I recognize them.</i>

13:22.385 --> 13:23.929
<i>Why?</i>

13:24.721 --> 13:26.264
<i>The French...</i>

13:29.351 --> 13:31.812
<i>the human stock of Europe.</i>

13:44.449 --> 13:49.454
<i>I wonder what would have become
of European culture</i>

13:50.747 --> 13:53.291
<i>if portraiture had not emerged.</i>

13:55.752 --> 13:59.631
<i>For some reason,
Europeans developed the wish,</i>

13:59.714 --> 14:04.010
<i>the necessity,
of painting people, faces...</i>

14:04.094 --> 14:08.139
<i>With a brisk whistle, he will have
the forbidden light extinguished.</i>

14:08.223 --> 14:11.977
<i>Why is this study
so important to Europeans,</i>

14:12.060 --> 14:16.940
<i>while other people, such as the Muslims,
don't have it at all?</i>

14:22.445 --> 14:24.114
<i>Who would I have been,</i>

14:24.197 --> 14:28.785
<i>had I never known or seen
the eyes of those who lived before me?</i>

14:49.097 --> 14:50.974
<i>I'll go down! I won't go down!</i>

14:51.057 --> 14:53.727
I'll go down! I won't go down!

14:53.810 --> 14:57.522
You go down!
-Shut up, you little brute, it's too loud!

15:04.863 --> 15:08.033
<i>In Europe, Europe is everywhere.</i>

15:09.117 --> 15:12.579
<i>We sit beside, opposite one another,</i>

15:12.662 --> 15:15.332
<i>and our lot is one and the same.</i>

15:18.126 --> 15:19.961
<i>Why is art</i>

15:21.338 --> 15:24.174
<i>unwilling to teach us prescience?</i>

15:33.350 --> 15:35.268
Don't you have a handkerchief?

15:35.352 --> 15:38.355
This is an alert.
-Yes, it's an alert, so?

15:46.696 --> 15:49.950
<i>So the German army has entered Paris.</i>

15:50.033 --> 15:52.869
<i>Yes, 1940. Summer...</i>

15:53.495 --> 15:54.788
<i>Summer.</i>

15:54.871 --> 15:59.125
<i>The army creeps forward,
creeps without any great haste.</i>

15:59.209 --> 16:02.295
<i>Paris is now an “open city”.</i>

16:02.379 --> 16:06.216
<i>Yet someone knew
it would turn out this way.</i>

16:06.299 --> 16:08.009
<i>How many more are to come?</i>

16:08.093 --> 16:10.303
<i>Yes, they're neighbors, we know them,</i>

16:10.387 --> 16:13.765
<i>but we weren't expecting them,
didn't invite them.</i>

16:14.933 --> 16:20.105
<i>An armistice is signed
between Germany and France.</i>

16:23.066 --> 16:26.861
<i>But how will the victor behave
on taking command</i>

16:26.945 --> 16:29.322
<i>of the center of world culture?</i>

16:32.909 --> 16:37.789
<i>Germany is a complex
and many-faceted invader.</i>

16:38.581 --> 16:43.586
<i>The French need to get used
to a powerful and diplomatic enemy.</i>

16:44.170 --> 16:47.507
<i>The military immediately settles in Paris.</i>

16:47.590 --> 16:50.385
<i>The troops are careful but confident.</i>

16:51.636 --> 16:56.975
<i>Yes, they trained, but they didn't expect
such an easy victory!</i>

17:02.897 --> 17:07.027
<i>In its own fashion, the German army
tries to reanimate life in Paris.</i>

17:07.110 --> 17:09.612
<i>Here their tribunal is commencing work.</i>

17:09.696 --> 17:13.450
<i>Not all young French citizens
accept the new laws.</i>

17:18.121 --> 17:21.958
<i>Since you are in Paris,
why not play something?</i>

17:22.459 --> 17:24.961
<i>The audience is grateful.</i>

17:41.061 --> 17:43.730
<i>Many thousand French citizens</i>

17:43.813 --> 17:47.942
<i>follow their government
by fleeing to the south.</i>

17:49.527 --> 17:54.991
<i>These include huge amounts
of civil servants from the French capital.</i>

17:55.950 --> 18:00.413
<i>The home of the French
national treasure, the Louvre,</i>

18:00.497 --> 18:04.084
<i>was probably the first to be visited
by German forces.</i>

18:07.504 --> 18:09.005
Take four.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.759
<i>And were we to imagine
how this took place,</i>

18:12.842 --> 18:15.011
<i>might it have been like this?</i>

18:34.030 --> 18:38.535
We're looking for Director Jaujard's office,
can you help us?

18:49.129 --> 18:51.047
<i>Count Wolff Metternich.</i>

18:52.382 --> 18:55.260
<i>He's a representative
of the German command</i>

18:55.343 --> 18:57.554
<i>and is here to inspect the Louvre.</i>

18:58.471 --> 19:00.181
... Jacques Jaujard?
-Yes.

19:00.265 --> 19:03.434
May I introduce Count Wolff Metternich?

19:05.562 --> 19:09.357
<i>Jacques Jaujard, a senior French official,</i>

19:09.440 --> 19:14.487
<i>director of the Louvre
and all national museums in France.</i>

19:16.614 --> 19:18.783
If you'd care to follow me...

19:26.040 --> 19:28.585
Please wait here for me, I will call you.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.102
Very modest.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.652
Very modest.

19:55.778 --> 19:58.156
Please be seated...

19:59.073 --> 20:01.075
Then I'll sit down here...

20:06.956 --> 20:10.668
Hélène, Hélène...
bring us some coffee, please.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.963
M. Jaujard,

20:14.047 --> 20:19.510
you are the first high-ranking
French civil servant I meet at his post.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.684
I must inform you

20:27.894 --> 20:32.774
that I represent the head
of the military administration in Paris

20:32.857 --> 20:36.486
and its significant department,
the “Kunstschutz”.

20:38.988 --> 20:42.408
Our mission
is to preserve art collections,

20:42.492 --> 20:46.663
museums and historic monuments
in France and Europe.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.499
Here is my calling card.

20:51.292 --> 20:55.797
Would you kindly inform me
as to the current state of the museum?

20:58.174 --> 20:59.884
Well?

21:05.056 --> 21:06.266
Yes.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.607
You'll find all the relevant information

21:18.403 --> 21:19.904
in this folder.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.531
Thank you.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.033
So...

21:31.207 --> 21:33.209
It's all there.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.794
It's all there.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.883
Are the curators showing much solidarity?

21:41.884 --> 21:43.386
They are.

21:46.556 --> 21:48.308
Do you speak German?

21:52.395 --> 21:54.063
No, I am very French.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.238
<i>The Count is 46 years old.</i>

22:03.573 --> 22:05.867
<i>His interlocutor is 44.</i>

22:07.577 --> 22:11.914
<i>Jaujard volunteered for the front
in the First World War,</i>

22:11.998 --> 22:15.001
<i>where he caught TB and was discharged.</i>

22:15.084 --> 22:17.253
<i>His father died on the front.</i>

22:21.674 --> 22:26.054
<i>Count Metternich was in active service
in the German Army</i>

22:26.137 --> 22:30.767
<i>throughout the duration
of the First World War.</i>

22:33.227 --> 22:37.607
<i>WWI was almost domestic,
was fought family by family...</i>

22:37.690 --> 22:41.110
<i>and was thus
particularly cruel and insane.</i>

22:42.445 --> 22:46.491
<i>It left long-lasting,
evil recollections in its wake.</i>

22:48.659 --> 22:52.288
<i>Cities, churches, monuments,
cultures were crushed,</i>

22:52.372 --> 22:54.207
<i>people were murdered, tortured.</i>

22:54.290 --> 22:58.961
<i>And how often had battles been fought
between Germans and French...?</i>

23:01.130 --> 23:03.841
<i>This is the private archive
of the Metternich family.</i>

23:04.592 --> 23:06.386
<i>This is him as a child.</i>

23:09.597 --> 23:11.641
<i>Here he is already a soldier.</i>

23:13.059 --> 23:18.189
<i>Ferdinand, Count Wolff Metternich,
his father, awaits him at home.</i>

23:19.315 --> 23:22.819
<i>His mother is Flaminia,
Princess of Salm-Salm.</i>

23:23.444 --> 23:25.822
<i>She will die on the eve of WWII.</i>

23:27.407 --> 23:31.494
<i>The family is large,
nine brothers and sisters.</i>

23:33.955 --> 23:38.000
<i>A German nobleman
and a Republican Frenchman.</i>

23:40.670 --> 23:45.466
<i>Jacques Jaujard was swift
to find his calling as a civil servant,</i>

23:45.550 --> 23:48.970
<i>but whether
this would be his vocation</i>

23:51.305 --> 23:54.225
<i>and whether he would be a happy man</i>

23:56.519 --> 23:59.272
<i>was known only to fate
and his future wives.</i>

24:02.316 --> 24:05.695
<i>Incidentally, it was as a young secretary</i>

24:05.778 --> 24:10.283
<i>to prominent left-wing politician
and mathematician, Paul Painlevé,</i>

24:12.118 --> 24:15.872
<i>that Jaujard received
his first Legion of Honor.</i>

24:28.050 --> 24:31.679
Thank you, no need. Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

25:26.317 --> 25:28.611
Hélène, where are you?

25:30.196 --> 25:33.115
Hélène... Is everyone hiding?

26:23.332 --> 26:25.835
<i>The Louvre, the Louvre...</i>

26:27.003 --> 26:28.462
<i>Silence.</i>

26:28.546 --> 26:30.339
<i>Nobody here...</i>

26:30.881 --> 26:33.718
<i>Many colleagues are sent to the châteaux</i>

26:33.801 --> 26:36.304
<i>where an collections are hidden.</i>

26:36.387 --> 26:41.892
<i>All that is left in the halls are
some classical and medieval sculpture.</i>

27:33.527 --> 27:35.404
<i>What is the Louvre?</i>

27:36.864 --> 27:40.034
<i>What is it,
now that France has lost the war?</i>

27:40.117 --> 27:43.454
<i>When occupying soldiers
stroll through Paris,</i>

27:43.537 --> 27:46.624
<i>when people seem
to have gotten used to this,</i>

27:46.707 --> 27:49.543
<i>when shops, cinemas and cafés are open,</i>

27:49.627 --> 27:54.006
<i>when French industry is successfully
working for the Wehrmacht,</i>

27:54.090 --> 27:59.595
<i>and when thousands of French students
have developed a new interest</i>

27:59.679 --> 28:02.181
<i>in the German language?</i>

28:02.264 --> 28:06.477
<i>Perhaps these young French
think a life shared with Germany</i>

28:06.560 --> 28:08.229
<i>is here to stay.</i>

28:12.942 --> 28:15.027
<i>At the start of the War,</i>

28:15.111 --> 28:19.073
<i>the French apparently
didn't want to believe</i>

28:19.156 --> 28:23.119
<i>in a total and ferocious war
with their European sister.</i>

28:26.288 --> 28:28.958
<i>The young French soldiers resisted
as best they could,</i>

28:29.041 --> 28:35.005
<i>but their politicians struggled among
themselves and forgot about their land.</i>

28:37.508 --> 28:40.886
<i>The state yields to Nazi force.</i>

28:40.970 --> 28:44.348
<i>The state restrains its army.</i>

28:47.143 --> 28:51.313
<i>French losses for this period:
tens of thousands of soldiers.</i>

28:52.857 --> 28:55.401
<i>Millions of refugees.</i>

28:56.152 --> 28:58.654
<i>The map of the French Republic.</i>

29:03.993 --> 29:07.204
<i>And this is already a different country.</i>

29:07.288 --> 29:09.957
<i>It's called the French State.</i>

29:10.040 --> 29:13.753
<i>It's no longer a republic.
Parliament is dissolved.</i>

29:13.836 --> 29:15.504
<i>There is no president.</i>

29:17.506 --> 29:21.677
<i>This line is where
German troops decided to stop.</i>

29:22.762 --> 29:26.265
<i>From then on,
the country consisted of two parts:</i>

29:26.348 --> 29:29.643
<i>the occupied, and the not yet taken.</i>

29:32.188 --> 29:35.900
<i>This is what the border
between them looks like.</i>

29:35.983 --> 29:40.905
<i>The government of new France
is formed in the small town of Vichy.</i>

29:42.031 --> 29:45.826
<i>It's a resort... waters, clinics...</i>

29:49.538 --> 29:54.919
<i>Marshal Pétain, French Ambassador
to Spain, a hero of WWI,</i>

29:55.002 --> 29:58.047
<i>agrees to lead the government in exile.</i>

30:04.220 --> 30:06.972
<i>But he is 84 years old.</i>

30:07.056 --> 30:08.808
<i>He was born in the 19th century.</i>

30:08.891 --> 30:12.728
<i>At his birth,
Emperor Napoleon III was in power.</i>

30:17.900 --> 30:19.860
<i>His family revered Bonaparte!</i>

30:21.737 --> 30:23.697
<i>That's how it turned out.</i>

30:23.781 --> 30:27.201
<i>A French Marshal, hero of WWI,</i>

30:27.284 --> 30:30.746
<i>came out against resistance
to an aggressor.</i>

30:31.789 --> 30:33.999
<i>That's how it turned out,</i>

30:34.083 --> 30:37.503
<i>that a French Marshal disbanded his army,</i>

30:37.586 --> 30:40.256
<i>urged his citizens to stop resisting,</i>

30:41.257 --> 30:44.718
<i>and announced the beginning
of a new revolution</i>

30:44.802 --> 30:47.596
<i>and the foundation of a new country.</i>

30:49.306 --> 30:53.894
<i>The Vichy French, who'd been rejecting
distant Russian Bolshevism,</i>

30:53.978 --> 30:57.064
<i>overlooked neighboring Nazism.</i>

30:59.525 --> 31:03.988
<i>Pétain, reserved, cold,
and undistinguished of birth,</i>

31:04.738 --> 31:10.286
<i>believes in the possibility and necessity
of partnership with Hitler.</i>

31:11.203 --> 31:13.873
<i>And sees in it France's salvation.</i>

31:14.874 --> 31:18.419
<i>And here we have his government,
his cabinet.</i>

31:18.502 --> 31:21.672
<i>They are to support the occupying forces,</i>

31:21.755 --> 31:24.049
<i>collect all taxes,</i>

31:24.133 --> 31:28.929
<i>and organize the French workforce
to replenish Germany's resources.</i>

31:29.430 --> 31:32.725
<i>This same government will head museums</i>

31:32.808 --> 31:36.604
<i>and cultural institutions
throughout all France.</i>

31:38.981 --> 31:43.944
<i>So the same old slow-seller
reappeared on the market.</i>

31:45.321 --> 31:47.364
<i>Can you guess which I mean?</i>

31:47.448 --> 31:49.867
<i>This product may be very expensive</i>

31:50.701 --> 31:52.369
<i>or be free.</i>

31:53.037 --> 31:55.456
<i>But the price of this product</i>

31:55.539 --> 31:58.667
<i>is always set by the buyer.</i>

32:05.507 --> 32:07.176
<i>Were you able to guess?</i>

32:07.843 --> 32:09.219
<i>No?</i>

32:09.803 --> 32:11.597
<i>Think it over.</i>

32:18.520 --> 32:21.231
REGULARS' TABLE

32:27.071 --> 32:30.032
<i>I see you weren't able to guess.</i>

32:30.950 --> 32:33.577
<i>It's peace. Simply peace.</i>

32:33.661 --> 32:35.412
<i>Calm.</i>

32:35.496 --> 32:37.873
<i>Peace can always be bought.</i>

32:47.508 --> 32:50.844
<i>The grand war fell silent in France.</i>

32:52.429 --> 32:54.431
<i>The French soldiers...</i>

32:55.724 --> 32:57.643
<i>are returning home.</i>

33:00.562 --> 33:01.730
<i>Paris...</i>

33:02.398 --> 33:03.482
<i>Paris...</i>

33:03.565 --> 33:05.693
<i>Hundreds of museums, libraries,</i>

33:05.776 --> 33:07.820
<i>theaters, galleries, universities,</i>

33:07.903 --> 33:11.156
<i>sciences, crafts, workers, engineers,</i>

33:11.240 --> 33:14.576
<i>press, democracy and customs.</i>

33:15.744 --> 33:19.832
<i>Would you give it all up
for the sake of principles,</i>

33:19.915 --> 33:23.293
<i>political convictions, slogans,</i>

33:23.794 --> 33:27.756
<i>and start a fully-fledged war
throughout France</i>

33:28.424 --> 33:29.925
<i>and in Paris?</i>

33:30.801 --> 33:33.762
<i>Paris, the “open city”,</i>

33:35.222 --> 33:39.101
<i>means Paris without bombardments
and without battles.</i>

33:41.895 --> 33:43.647
<i>There's the computer.</i>

33:44.440 --> 33:46.900
<i>His signal has come through again.</i>

33:47.693 --> 33:49.486
What a storm!

33:49.987 --> 33:52.781
Get rid of the cargo or you will perish!

33:54.283 --> 33:57.578
This museum freight, why did you take it?

34:00.122 --> 34:02.499
Dirk! Dirk!

34:02.583 --> 34:06.503
Your bridge is in chaos.
Files have fallen on the floor...

34:07.004 --> 34:08.797
Is it that bad?

34:11.300 --> 34:13.177
It seems vicious.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.653
The connection is gone again...

34:34.740 --> 34:37.451
<i>Today is a bad day.</i>

34:41.955 --> 34:46.251
<i>Somehow it's all so close,
the storm, sinking ships,</i>

34:46.335 --> 34:49.004
<i>Europe, Paris, war.</i>

34:51.548 --> 34:54.176
<i>Time is a tight knot.</i>

34:56.386 --> 34:58.680
<i>What has time got to do with it?</i>

34:59.181 --> 35:02.684
<i>The First World War, the Second...</i>

35:05.312 --> 35:06.814
<i>There.</i>

35:06.897 --> 35:09.191
<i>The beauty of an ancient world.</i>

35:10.067 --> 35:13.529
<i>These are but fragments
of that civilization.</i>

35:19.451 --> 35:21.078
<i>Assyria.</i>

35:21.703 --> 35:27.042
<i>All of this once decorated
the king's palace in the Assyrian capital.</i>

35:29.461 --> 35:32.506
<i>That state is long gone,</i>

35:32.589 --> 35:35.134
<i>but these messages from 700 BC</i>

35:35.217 --> 35:39.221
<i>summon numerous strange feelings.</i>

35:44.059 --> 35:46.436
<i>Lamassu, winged bulls.</i>

35:47.229 --> 35:50.899
<i>Threatening and naive,
like in the fairy tales.</i>

36:03.495 --> 36:05.289
<i>The fear of power.</i>

36:06.039 --> 36:08.709
<i>Fear in the face of power.</i>

36:09.251 --> 36:13.714
<i>Brilliance of craftsmanship,
the perfect creation of fear.</i>

36:35.485 --> 36:36.987
<i>In the 19th century,</i>

36:37.070 --> 36:41.116
<i>all this was brought by ship
from afar to the Louvre.</i>

36:41.867 --> 36:43.869
<i>Some items were bought...</i>

36:43.952 --> 36:46.205
<i>some were war trophies.</i>

36:53.086 --> 36:55.047
<i>But on that long voyage,</i>

36:55.130 --> 36:57.049
<i>in severe storms,</i>

36:57.132 --> 37:01.762
<i>overloaded ships sank to the bottom.</i>

37:01.845 --> 37:07.267
<i>Uncounted are the creations
hidden from us in the suffocating depths,</i>

37:07.351 --> 37:10.979
<i>and uncounted the seamen who perished.</i>

37:13.106 --> 37:14.650
<i>What a price...</i>

37:15.234 --> 37:16.902
<i>And for what?</i>

37:18.153 --> 37:19.488
<i>Yes...</i>

37:19.571 --> 37:23.867
<i>It was the museum fever of the Old World.</i>

37:24.451 --> 37:30.123
<i>It was the best passion
the Old World was still capable of,</i>

37:30.207 --> 37:33.669
<i>given its love of waging war
for any reason.</i>

38:23.385 --> 38:25.178
<i>Mr. Tolstoy,</i>

38:26.221 --> 38:27.848
<i>Mr. Tolstoy...</i>

38:27.931 --> 38:29.433
<i>wake up.</i>

38:30.976 --> 38:35.105
<i>Sadly I don't have the key
to his awakening.</i>

38:38.317 --> 38:39.985
I was asleep.

38:40.861 --> 38:42.070
Sorry!

38:52.414 --> 38:53.957
<i>Wars, wars...</i>

38:55.667 --> 38:58.128
<i>elemental forces... kings...</i>

38:58.211 --> 39:01.256
<i>The Louvre has outgrown its clothes.</i>

39:02.924 --> 39:05.093
<i>In the 20th century, the French president</i>

39:05.177 --> 39:09.222
<i>decides on the construction
of the Grand Louvre.</i>

39:11.224 --> 39:14.686
<i>A dig will begin
in the center of the square,</i>

39:15.270 --> 39:19.024
<i>to reveal the Louvre's beginning,
its foundations.</i>

39:20.359 --> 39:24.529
<i>Then a huge underground space
will be constructed</i>

39:24.613 --> 39:27.491
<i>to connect all parts of the old Louvre</i>

39:27.574 --> 39:30.744
<i>and create an entire underground city</i>

39:30.827 --> 39:35.123
<i>with warehouses, labs,
streets and traffic lights.</i>

39:38.919 --> 39:43.215
<i>Once again the Louvre
will be like nowhere else on Earth.</i>

39:43.298 --> 39:45.634
Freedom, equality...

39:49.137 --> 39:50.639
brotherhood!

39:56.269 --> 39:59.940
Freedom, equality, brotherhood!
-Without me.

40:00.023 --> 40:02.859
Freedom, equality, brotherhood...

40:40.313 --> 40:44.693
<i>Lord, Lord,
how long ago all of it started!</i>

40:47.863 --> 40:50.907
<i>What did?</i>

40:51.408 --> 40:53.368
<i>The human search for form,</i>

40:54.202 --> 40:56.329
<i>the battle against imitation.</i>

40:57.414 --> 40:59.124
<i>The screams and moans.</i>

40:59.207 --> 41:01.209
<i>The discovery of the soul...</i>

41:02.711 --> 41:06.047
<i>and the incomprehension as to what to do</i>

41:07.257 --> 41:10.343
<i>with the mortal and now superfluous body.</i>

41:13.096 --> 41:16.308
<i>The hand is truly smarter than the head.</i>

41:16.391 --> 41:20.353
<i>It forms and creates
faster than a thought is born.</i>

41:24.733 --> 41:27.903
<i>This sculpture is 9000 years old.</i>

41:31.740 --> 41:36.703
<i>And it was found in Jordan, in 1972.</i>

41:42.083 --> 41:43.043
<i>I don't know</i>

41:43.126 --> 41:48.924
<i>what my favorite architect, Pierre Lescot,
would say about this sculpture.</i>

41:51.051 --> 41:55.305
<i>The end of the 16th century.
The French Renaissance.</i>

42:04.940 --> 42:08.318
<i>One of Lescot's designs,
the facade of the Louvre.</i>

42:10.403 --> 42:15.825
<i>Architects such as he were capable
of building the new capital of the world.</i>

42:20.664 --> 42:24.000
<i>Pierre Lescot designed this wonder.</i>

42:24.960 --> 42:28.296
<i>The Henry II staircase at the Louvre.</i>

42:36.346 --> 42:39.349
<i>Listen here, contemporary architects.</i>

42:40.016 --> 42:43.144
<i>Lescot was a mathematician, a painter,</i>

42:43.770 --> 42:46.356
<i>a priest and an architect.</i>

42:47.148 --> 42:49.693
<i>The year was 1553.</i>

42:50.652 --> 42:52.153
<i>Lord!</i>

42:53.154 --> 42:55.991
<i>How long ago it all started!</i>

43:03.331 --> 43:04.874
<i>You again...</i>

43:04.958 --> 43:07.544
<i>Are you stalking me?</i>

43:08.503 --> 43:10.589
<i>And eavesdropping?</i>

43:10.672 --> 43:12.132
<i>An intrusive ghost...</i>

43:12.215 --> 43:14.426
And who the ghost is...

43:14.509 --> 43:16.678
<i>You were saying? Well?</i>

43:19.180 --> 43:20.682
No, stay there.

43:20.765 --> 43:23.518
Come closer. Come on. Closer.

43:24.853 --> 43:26.479
Come!

43:30.150 --> 43:33.361
Of course it was I
who brought all this here.

43:36.740 --> 43:38.158
This?

43:38.241 --> 43:40.702
All these sculptures
are from my campaigns...

43:42.954 --> 43:44.914
when I waged war.

43:50.587 --> 43:53.131
Everything here was brought back by me.

43:53.214 --> 43:56.051
Everything here. Everything.

43:57.218 --> 43:59.929
Why else would I have gone to war?

44:00.013 --> 44:02.432
Well? Why?

44:04.059 --> 44:07.145
For this, for art. That's it.

44:07.228 --> 44:08.813
I went to war for art.

44:11.107 --> 44:14.402
Do you like this corpse?
It's Seneca.

44:14.986 --> 44:17.530
<i>Is it that emperors know their art?</i>

44:17.614 --> 44:19.157
Me? Yes!

44:27.832 --> 44:30.126
I had excellent advisers...

44:33.004 --> 44:36.883
when it was a question
of taking or leaving behind.

44:44.683 --> 44:47.352
The whole universe defines a work.

44:47.435 --> 44:51.898
And war alone decides
where it will end up.

45:04.786 --> 45:10.041
<i>In Paris, military officials
had a quiet life in general.</i>

45:11.167 --> 45:13.211
<i>They stayed in good hotels.</i>

45:13.962 --> 45:17.298
<i>The French administration
remained in Paris.</i>

45:18.675 --> 45:21.469
<i>The German army simply observed.</i>

45:23.638 --> 45:26.266
<i>Many of the German officers in Paris</i>

45:26.349 --> 45:28.518
<i>knew the French language.</i>

45:28.601 --> 45:32.063
<i>Many of them
had been schooled in the liberal arts.</i>

45:32.147 --> 45:35.692
<i>Historians, philosophers...
but now in uniform.</i>

45:40.655 --> 45:43.533
<i>They'd often been
to Paris before the war</i>

45:43.616 --> 45:47.370
<i>and didn't conceal
their love of French culture.</i>

45:54.419 --> 45:56.546
Ah, there you are.

46:02.010 --> 46:03.344
Is there any hot water?

46:03.428 --> 46:06.556
<i>Count, was it interesting with M. Jaujard?</i>

46:06.639 --> 46:09.058
Yes, indeed it was.

46:10.518 --> 46:13.438
But I don't envy him his position.

46:14.522 --> 46:16.483
M. Jaujard told me in detail

46:16.566 --> 46:21.112
how the Louvre's collection
was evacuated to various châteaux.

46:22.405 --> 46:26.993
They have lots of space,
no risk of bombings, huge cellars.

46:28.077 --> 46:31.164
I'm visiting
Château de Sourches tomorrow.

46:31.247 --> 46:33.666
Would you care to accompany me?

46:35.126 --> 46:37.587
<i>Do you think Paris may be bombed?</i>

46:37.670 --> 46:40.006
London and Rotterdam were bombed.

46:43.718 --> 46:46.679
Look at the photos
on my desk back there.

46:50.391 --> 46:54.229
<i>Did you know in Germany
that the Louvre was empty?</i>

46:54.729 --> 46:56.397
What do you think?

46:56.481 --> 47:00.735
<i>They packed 6000 crates,
how could it be a secret?</i>

47:00.819 --> 47:04.948
In 1939 I removed all art
from Cologne Cathedral.

47:05.490 --> 47:07.492
And not only from there.

47:07.575 --> 47:10.912
<i>So in the museums
there was a presentiment of war?</i>

47:12.288 --> 47:16.376
We hadn't the slightest doubt
that war was imminent.

47:16.459 --> 47:19.128
We simply continued with our work.

47:23.091 --> 47:26.094
<i>All museums must be prepared for war.</i>

47:49.075 --> 47:51.119
I'm off.

47:57.625 --> 48:01.504
There's still the matter
of getting it on the truck.

48:03.131 --> 48:04.799
What's this noise?

48:05.967 --> 48:07.677
What's this noise?

48:10.513 --> 48:12.140
What is this?

48:12.765 --> 48:16.019
<i>Your Majesty, this is
the Winged Victory of Samothrace,</i>

48:16.102 --> 48:17.729
<i>from the second century BC.</i>

48:17.812 --> 48:18.938
Oh, yes?

48:19.022 --> 48:21.858
<i>It's not your trophy. It's from later.</i>

48:21.941 --> 48:25.445
It's beautiful.
What beautiful plumage.

48:26.487 --> 48:30.116
I'm a civil servant
of the French Administration,

48:31.492 --> 48:34.579
whose government
allies itself to the enemy.

48:34.662 --> 48:38.041
Do I know why I'm working
for this government?

48:40.335 --> 48:41.836
Yes, I do.

48:47.008 --> 48:49.886
Do I know
that this could last a long time?

49:11.616 --> 49:15.411
<i>I'm a civil servant
of the French Administration,</i>

49:16.579 --> 49:19.666
<i>whose government
allies itself to the enemy.</i>

49:19.749 --> 49:22.961
<i>Do I know why
I'm working for this government?</i>

49:25.421 --> 49:26.923
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

49:32.178 --> 49:35.223
<i>Do I know
that' this could last a long time ?</i>

50:35.616 --> 50:39.287
<i>of course there was nothing here
once upon a time.</i>

50:39.954 --> 50:44.292
<i>The people who lived here
did so in fear of Viking raids.</i>

50:45.710 --> 50:49.422
<i>In the 12th century,
they built a fortress with a castle.</i>

50:49.505 --> 50:51.716
<i>People began to settle around it.</i>

50:51.799 --> 50:53.468
<i>So it began.</i>

50:54.594 --> 50:56.262
<i>How strange.</i>

50:57.055 --> 50:58.556
<i>How astonishing.</i>

50:59.307 --> 51:03.895
<i>To this very piece of land,
a little over one square kilometer,</i>

51:03.978 --> 51:11.319
<i>these French kings and architects
are to cling, as if following a premonition,</i>

51:11.402 --> 51:14.655
<i>and will work this land,
build on it, rebuild it,</i>

51:14.739 --> 51:18.785
<i>and pass it on, one to the next,
without relenting.</i>

51:18.868 --> 51:22.997
<i>Châteaux, palaces,
palaces, châteaux... a museum.</i>

51:23.831 --> 51:29.003
<i>They will never lose ground, regardless
of revolution or elemental force,</i>

51:29.087 --> 51:31.756
<i>until it can finally be proclaimed:</i>

51:31.839 --> 51:34.425
<i>“Our Louvre has been built”.</i>

51:40.389 --> 51:44.352
<i>That hardest,
most tormenting time, the Revolution.</i>

51:44.435 --> 51:46.229
<i>Executions, killings...</i>

51:46.312 --> 51:49.899
<i>Great names flimmered,
blood was spilled...</i>

51:51.317 --> 51:55.404
<i>And nobody knew
where the army began or ended.</i>

51:56.739 --> 51:58.783
<i>Grand words were spoken.</i>

51:58.866 --> 52:02.620
<i>“Human rights”,
“citizens”, “constitution”.</i>

52:02.703 --> 52:06.374
<i>Famine, guillotine, republic, democracy.</i>

52:06.874 --> 52:10.294
<i>The young Napoleon decided
war would save the land.</i>

52:10.378 --> 52:12.130
<i>War.</i>

52:12.213 --> 52:13.172
Follow me.

52:13.256 --> 52:17.301
<i>It was he who transformed the Louvre
into an official museum,</i>

52:17.385 --> 52:20.805
<i>the place
where artistic war trophies are kept.</i>

52:20.888 --> 52:24.350
<i>Suddenly the state understands</i>

52:24.433 --> 52:27.728
<i>that it cannot exist without museums.</i>

52:31.899 --> 52:33.359
There!

52:35.278 --> 52:36.779
That's me.

52:39.240 --> 52:41.075
You don't recognize me?

52:46.747 --> 52:48.291
<i>It's you...</i>

52:48.374 --> 52:50.042
<i>You on a donkey!</i>

52:57.091 --> 53:00.052
<i>I'd show other paintings.</i>

53:03.764 --> 53:05.266
<i>The Seine.</i>

53:05.349 --> 53:08.102
<i>The view of the Louvre from Pont Neuf.</i>

53:09.270 --> 53:11.772
<i>The year is 1666.</i>

53:11.856 --> 53:14.275
<i>It is already a great city.</i>

53:20.865 --> 53:23.784
<i>Hubert Robert in the year 1789.</i>

53:24.410 --> 53:26.204
<i>The Grande Gallery.</i>

53:26.287 --> 53:29.081
<i>He was an artist
and director of the Louvre</i>

53:29.165 --> 53:31.918
<i>shortly before Napoleon came to power,</i>

53:32.001 --> 53:36.339
<i>designing and painting
the skylights in the ceiling.</i>

53:39.467 --> 53:44.347
<i>The Grande Gallery
was astonishing in its spaciousness.</i>

53:44.430 --> 53:48.434
<i>It was from here
that the museum of the Louvre began.</i>

53:48.517 --> 53:53.564
<i>It wasn't a road,
but the path of European art.</i>

53:53.648 --> 53:56.150
<i>Step by step, year by year...</i>

53:56.901 --> 53:59.987
<i>everyone in a row, eye to eye.</i>

54:02.156 --> 54:06.911
<i>Robert had a sense of humor, too.
Here is the gallery in ruins.</i>

54:06.994 --> 54:09.372
<i>It's just a fantasy, of course.</i>

54:12.124 --> 54:15.962
<i>The Louvre was already
the center of the city back then.</i>

54:16.045 --> 54:19.715
<i>A place for important meetings
for the citizens of Paris.</i>

54:19.799 --> 54:23.386
<i>And painting
became a vital part of everyday life.</i>

54:24.262 --> 54:27.807
<i>There was nothing comparable anywhere.</i>

54:33.354 --> 54:34.981
<i>Let it not be forgotten,</i>

54:35.064 --> 54:38.693
<i>the Louvre's works
are by order of French powers.</i>

54:39.860 --> 54:42.446
<i>Visconti, the architect,</i>

54:42.530 --> 54:47.076
<i>presenting to Napoleon III
the plans for the New Louvre.</i>

54:50.705 --> 54:54.542
<i>The Louvre is a museum,
but also a palace for oneself.</i>

55:04.176 --> 55:06.554
<i>This painting is from the year 1880.</i>

55:06.637 --> 55:08.931
<i>The square hall of the Louvre.</i>

55:11.100 --> 55:14.228
<i>The Louvre's generosity knows no bounds.</i>

55:15.062 --> 55:17.523
<i>Hundreds of paintings on the wall.</i>

55:18.566 --> 55:20.192
<i>All that exists...</i>

55:20.735 --> 55:23.112
<i>is there, on those walls.</i>

55:27.575 --> 55:31.203
<i>The Apollo Gallery, 1880.</i>

55:31.787 --> 55:35.416
<i>Silence and the clouds over Paris.</i>

55:49.430 --> 55:54.769
<i>The Great Gallery
with its wonderful skylights.</i>

55:56.437 --> 55:58.272
<i>A temple for paintings...</i>

55:58.356 --> 56:02.276
<i>Who else could have built
such a temple for paintings?</i>

56:06.489 --> 56:08.449
<i>1885.</i>

56:09.492 --> 56:11.994
<i>The Egyptian Hall of the Louvre.</i>

56:14.288 --> 56:15.790
<i>A trophy of war.</i>

56:16.624 --> 56:21.128
<i>Silent, like a prisoner is supposed to be.</i>

56:34.809 --> 56:37.061
<i>1894.</i>

56:38.813 --> 56:42.650
<i>Two copy girls at work
in front of a Botticelli fresco.</i>

56:48.614 --> 56:50.825
<i>Many paintings in the Louvre</i>

56:51.867 --> 56:55.496
<i>depict women engaged in painting.</i>

57:28.028 --> 57:30.781
<i>You aren't tired of listening to me yet?</i>

57:32.199 --> 57:35.119
<i>There's very little left to bear.</i>

57:53.471 --> 57:55.347
That's me.

57:57.892 --> 57:59.560
<i>You again.</i>

58:00.102 --> 58:02.229
Look, my coronation.

58:03.147 --> 58:04.899
Perfect beauty.

58:08.486 --> 58:09.987
That's me.

58:16.619 --> 58:19.121
I thought I saw some Prussians.

58:20.039 --> 58:22.374
How could they be at the Louvre?

58:23.125 --> 58:25.586
<i>I don't dare explain, Emperor.</i>

58:28.923 --> 58:32.510
<i>“A vile king, a vile nation, a vile army.</i>

58:32.593 --> 58:35.638
<i>A state that deceives everyone</i>

58:35.721 --> 58:37.723
<i>and doesn't deserve to exist.”</i>

58:37.806 --> 58:42.269
<i>Your Majesty,
weren't these your words on Prussia?</i>

58:53.781 --> 58:55.991
<i>Mediums fall asleep on time.</i>

58:57.952 --> 58:59.620
<i>Let him sleep.</i>

59:01.539 --> 59:04.875
<i>He hasn't served France in a long time...</i>

59:08.629 --> 59:10.172
<i>although...</i>

59:10.798 --> 59:13.801
<i>mediums never sleep tight.</i>

1:00:58.989 --> 1:01:03.452
I've had it.
You said you were there...

1:01:04.078 --> 1:01:06.080
No but it's... Yes, I know.

1:01:13.295 --> 1:01:14.588
Gentlemen,

1:01:15.547 --> 1:01:17.549
like many other states,

1:01:17.633 --> 1:01:20.344
Germany signed the Hague Convention,

1:01:20.427 --> 1:01:24.223
on the laws of,
and conduct during, warfare.

1:01:24.306 --> 1:01:26.684
Under it, all cultural monuments

1:01:26.767 --> 1:01:31.689
enjoy the special protection
of the warring states.

1:01:32.606 --> 1:01:37.903
We acted in compliance therewith
during the 1914-1918 war,

1:01:38.445 --> 1:01:40.072
and now, too,

1:01:40.155 --> 1:01:43.200
we consider it our holy duty,

1:01:43.283 --> 1:01:47.037
in the name of European solidarity...

1:01:47.121 --> 1:01:49.123
<i>France, France...</i>

1:01:51.125 --> 1:01:55.087
<i>How lucky you were
that your sister, Germany,</i>

1:01:55.170 --> 1:01:58.048
<i>recognized your right to exist.</i>

1:02:00.134 --> 1:02:02.052
<i>What will become of those</i>

1:02:02.136 --> 1:02:05.931
<i>whose human nature
she does not acknowledge?</i>

1:02:06.974 --> 1:02:08.559
<i>Bolshevik Russia, for example.</i>

1:02:08.642 --> 1:02:11.979
<i>Oh, that Bolshevism, the Bolsheviks...</i>

1:02:12.730 --> 1:02:14.940
<i>how they resisted...</i>

1:02:15.023 --> 1:02:17.192
<i>fought for every Russian village</i>

1:02:17.860 --> 1:02:19.653
<i>and city.</i>

1:02:20.487 --> 1:02:24.116
<i>The German military
followed Hitler's orders:</i>

1:02:24.199 --> 1:02:26.952
<i>Art monuments on the Eastern Front</i>

1:02:27.035 --> 1:02:31.165
<i>have no significance
and shall be consigned to destruction.</i>

1:02:31.999 --> 1:02:36.003
<i>The huge European city
of Soviet Russia, Leningrad,</i>

1:02:37.296 --> 1:02:39.506
<i>was encircled by a blockade.</i>

1:02:43.761 --> 1:02:46.597
<i>Hundreds of thousands of citizens,</i>

1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:53.061
<i>museums, libraries, theaters,
universities, sciences, music, life...</i>

1:02:57.566 --> 1:03:00.402
<i>Bombardments, artillery fire...</i>

1:03:01.069 --> 1:03:03.071
<i>famine... cold.</i>

1:03:03.155 --> 1:03:05.949
LENINGRAD IS NOW CUT OFF
FROM THE REST OF RUSSIA

1:03:09.995 --> 1:03:13.457
<i>People dying by the thousands every day.</i>

1:03:13.540 --> 1:03:18.295
<i>Corpses in the streets,
on stairways, in apartments, in yards,</i>

1:03:18.378 --> 1:03:21.048
<i>in basements... corpses, corpses.</i>

1:03:24.551 --> 1:03:26.929
<i>No strength to bury them.</i>

1:03:28.096 --> 1:03:29.598
<i>No one to do it.</i>

1:03:54.414 --> 1:03:56.333
<i>In this city...</i>

1:03:56.416 --> 1:03:57.918
<i>a million people...</i>

1:03:58.919 --> 1:04:01.255
<i>will lie in mass graves.</i>

1:04:06.593 --> 1:04:09.388
<i>Here, a diary entry:</i>

1:04:09.471 --> 1:04:13.517
<i>“Walking by the river, I see a woman
with her child. Both are frozen.</i>

1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:16.728
<i>The next day the child is gone,
probably eaten.</i>

1:04:16.812 --> 1:04:19.147
<i>The woman's legs are gone, too.”</i>

1:04:20.399 --> 1:04:23.110
<i>A catastrophe more dire than hell.</i>

1:04:25.779 --> 1:04:28.657
<i>The Hermitage Museum,
the Russian Renaissance,</i>

1:04:28.740 --> 1:04:31.910
<i>is frozen into the history
of the Blockade.</i>

1:04:31.994 --> 1:04:37.332
<i>In its cellars the wounded are treated,
in its halls, coffins are built.</i>

1:04:38.750 --> 1:04:40.961
<i>Bombardments, artillery fire.</i>

1:04:41.879 --> 1:04:45.465
<i>Here too, the greatest treasures
had been sent away.</i>

1:04:51.346 --> 1:04:53.473
<i>Soldiers are brought from the front...</i>

1:04:53.557 --> 1:04:54.558
REMBRANDT

1:04:54.641 --> 1:04:57.561
<i>...to walk among the empty frames:</i>

1:04:57.644 --> 1:04:59.479
<i>This is an El Greco.</i>

1:05:01.315 --> 1:05:03.025
<i>This one is a Leonardo.</i>

1:05:03.650 --> 1:05:06.361
<i>Dear Lord, a Leonardo was here.</i>

1:05:09.281 --> 1:05:12.826
<i>How one wishes to forget all this.</i>

1:05:20.500 --> 1:05:22.127
<i>To forget him.</i>

1:05:27.507 --> 1:05:29.009
<i>And this.</i>

1:05:36.350 --> 1:05:38.310
<i>And these prisoners.</i>

1:05:45.275 --> 1:05:47.027
<i>And these prisoners.</i>

1:05:48.278 --> 1:05:50.197
<i>And this stare.</i>

1:05:53.241 --> 1:05:57.204
<i>Maybe none of this ever happened.</i>

1:05:57.746 --> 1:06:01.875
<i>Maybe all of this was made up
by us Europeans.</i>

1:06:02.542 --> 1:06:04.044
<i>Maybe we dreamt it.</i>

1:06:06.380 --> 1:06:10.634
<i>We do have
such extraordinary writers, philosophers.</i>

1:06:11.551 --> 1:06:14.304
<i>Our artists are such visionaries</i>

1:06:18.058 --> 1:06:20.894
<i>who dearly love humans.</i>

1:06:22.562 --> 1:06:24.982
<i>And in the Louvre, everything is about</i>

1:06:25.065 --> 1:06:30.237
<i>how people struggled, loved,
killed, repented, lied and cried.</i>

1:06:34.908 --> 1:06:37.452
<i>Emperor, you again!</i>

1:06:38.078 --> 1:06:39.746
It is me!

1:06:43.417 --> 1:06:46.294
<i>Dear Marianne, chase him away.</i>

1:06:51.466 --> 1:06:52.968
That's me!

1:07:04.771 --> 1:07:08.900
Freedom, equality, brotherhood!

1:07:08.984 --> 1:07:10.652
It's me!

1:07:11.570 --> 1:07:13.280
All of it!

1:07:13.363 --> 1:07:14.781
This!

1:07:16.616 --> 1:07:19.828
Freedom, equality, brotherhood!

1:07:22.247 --> 1:07:23.749
It's me.

1:07:24.833 --> 1:07:28.503
Freedom, equality, brotherhood!

1:07:29.463 --> 1:07:31.256
Without me...

1:07:32.716 --> 1:07:34.259
there would be nothing.

1:07:35.385 --> 1:07:38.972
Freedom, equality, brotherhood!

1:07:43.060 --> 1:07:48.398
On occupying the country,
German troops did their utmost

1:07:48.482 --> 1:07:51.985
to follow the orders of their leadership

1:07:52.069 --> 1:07:55.405
and spare the most important
cultural monuments,

1:07:55.489 --> 1:07:58.283
so that we can say today

1:07:58.366 --> 1:08:02.829
that the majority of the big cathedrals
were saved!

1:08:03.538 --> 1:08:07.751
The same can be said
of the famous castles,

1:08:07.834 --> 1:08:11.838
palaces and art collections.

1:08:13.006 --> 1:08:16.968
<i>There is basically nothing
but sculpture left at the Louvre.</i>

1:08:17.052 --> 1:08:20.263
<i>The valuables
have been removed and hidden.</i>

1:08:20.347 --> 1:08:22.933
<i>The opening ceremony is just politics.</i>

1:08:23.016 --> 1:08:26.019
<i>Paris is occupied, everything is fine.</i>

1:08:26.978 --> 1:08:30.190
<i>The Louvre is open,
everyone is mollified.</i>

1:08:31.566 --> 1:08:34.694
<i>Now the German troops
will give guided tours</i>

1:08:34.778 --> 1:08:37.072
<i>of that which remains.</i>

1:08:41.743 --> 1:08:46.289
<i>One must give the Count
and his “Kunstschutz” their due</i>

1:08:46.373 --> 1:08:49.042
<i>for having preserved monuments.</i>

1:08:50.377 --> 1:08:52.921
<i>He was just speaking about it.</i>

1:08:54.673 --> 1:08:56.716
<i>The organization is very active.</i>

1:08:58.051 --> 1:09:02.639
<i>They begin to photograph and archive
all European cultural monuments,</i>

1:09:02.722 --> 1:09:05.392
<i>and to repair damage due to battles.</i>

1:09:06.226 --> 1:09:09.646
<i>Naturally it was part
of the aggressor's political agenda.</i>

1:09:11.064 --> 1:09:14.651
<i>The “Kunstschutz” worked systematically</i>

1:09:14.734 --> 1:09:19.114
<i>in France, Belgium,
Greece, Serbia, Italy...</i>

1:09:20.031 --> 1:09:23.201
<i>They strangely even planned
to work in Russia...</i>

1:09:23.285 --> 1:09:26.288
<i>but battles remained ongoing there.</i>

1:09:29.583 --> 1:09:33.003
<i>Count Metternich
obtained from command a ruling</i>

1:09:33.086 --> 1:09:39.134
<i>governing conservation and protection
of artistic treasures in occupied lands.</i>

1:09:40.802 --> 1:09:45.098
<i>Here's the result,
a memo to all German soldiers:</i>

1:09:45.182 --> 1:09:46.808
<i>“German soldiers!</i>

1:09:47.767 --> 1:09:49.352
<i>Throughout France,</i>

1:09:49.436 --> 1:09:53.607
<i>you encounter many manors
and other historic buildings,</i>

1:09:54.107 --> 1:09:58.153
<i>which have served and will serve
as temporary housing.</i>

1:09:59.112 --> 1:10:00.697
<i>Many of those buildings</i>

1:10:00.780 --> 1:10:04.284
<i>are exceptional monuments
of an' and history.</i>

1:10:04.784 --> 1:10:06.786
<i>Observe these rules:</i>

1:10:06.870 --> 1:10:08.872
<i>Be careful while heating!</i>

1:10:08.955 --> 1:10:13.043
<i>Burned-down castles
are a cause to blame German soldiers.</i>

1:10:13.126 --> 1:10:17.047
<i>Be careful during the installation
of electric wires.</i>

1:10:17.130 --> 1:10:20.091
<i>Handle works of art with care,</i>

1:10:20.175 --> 1:10:24.429
<i>do not burn broken furniture
or damaged wallpaper.</i>

1:10:24.971 --> 1:10:29.476
<i>Bronze chandeliers are not
to be used as coat hangers.</i>

1:10:29.976 --> 1:10:32.896
<i>Demonstrate that
you are the same Germans</i>

1:10:32.979 --> 1:10:36.233
<i>who defeated Bolshevism in the East.”</i>

1:10:40.654 --> 1:10:42.739
Where are the owners?

1:10:42.822 --> 1:10:45.408
<i>Château Sourches, 300 km from Paris.</i>

1:10:45.492 --> 1:10:49.704
The château has been requisitioned,
but they have stayed close by.

1:10:50.372 --> 1:10:53.458
<i>I was invited here by Metternich.</i>

1:10:53.541 --> 1:10:58.838
<i>This is one of the places
where art from the Louvre was hidden.</i>

1:11:02.008 --> 1:11:05.470
<i>Metternich visits
to check storage conditions.</i>

1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:09.724
<i>He is met by a representative
of the Louvre.</i>

1:11:10.892 --> 1:11:12.852
So beautiful.

1:11:12.936 --> 1:11:16.523
<i>A beautiful place,
and beautiful to live in, too.</i>

1:11:23.321 --> 1:11:28.368
<i>Much like the Palace of Gracht,
where the Count spent his childhood.</i>

1:11:29.619 --> 1:11:32.414
<i>He is used to seeing beautiful things.</i>

1:11:45.010 --> 1:11:49.639
<i>The current castle dates back to Louis II
du Bouchet, Marquis of Sourches,</i>

1:11:49.723 --> 1:11:52.309
fourth Provost of the Royal Palace,

1:11:52.392 --> 1:11:54.978
whose jurisdiction
extended to the Louvre

1:11:55.061 --> 1:11:57.856
and to the entire royal household.

1:11:57.939 --> 1:12:01.818
The park grounds were finished
long before the castle,

1:12:02.444 --> 1:12:05.572
which was completed around 1780.

1:12:05.655 --> 1:12:09.409
Its main ornament is the dry moat,

1:12:10.410 --> 1:12:14.122
probably a throwback
to the old feudal fortress.

1:12:18.084 --> 1:12:22.922
We are completely deprived of fuel
and need it for the fire pumps.

1:12:23.006 --> 1:12:25.592
How powerful Géricault's work is!

1:12:29.095 --> 1:12:30.805
The Raft of the Medusa.

1:12:30.889 --> 1:12:33.683
I'll sign the papers
when we're back upstairs.

1:12:33.767 --> 1:12:39.064
You know, it was the only place in France
where large works could be stored.

1:12:39.147 --> 1:12:43.109
We even had to tear down part of a wall
to bring them in.

1:12:47.947 --> 1:12:50.700
This room is unusable

1:12:50.784 --> 1:12:52.619
due to humidity.

1:12:57.665 --> 1:13:00.668
I invite you to view another cellar.

1:13:00.752 --> 1:13:02.253
All right.

1:13:17.018 --> 1:13:21.731
<i>Another great asset we have
is the excellent central heating</i>

1:13:21.815 --> 1:13:23.775
<i>that we run continuously,</i>

1:13:24.776 --> 1:13:26.569
<i>even in summer,</i>

1:13:26.653 --> 1:13:28.988
<i>to balance inside temperature</i>

1:13:29.072 --> 1:13:31.825
<i>and avoid the dew point phenomenon.</i>

1:13:38.748 --> 1:13:43.753
<i>Count Wolff Metternich
is an art historian</i>

1:13:44.295 --> 1:13:48.299
<i>and the main custodian
of the arts in the Rhineland.</i>

1:13:49.509 --> 1:13:53.054
<i>The Count writes in 1933:</i>

1:13:54.097 --> 1:13:59.394
<i>“Our Führer wants us to return
to our ancient roots,</i>

1:13:59.477 --> 1:14:02.897
<i>to respecting the works of the past.”</i>

1:14:03.690 --> 1:14:05.358
<i>You are right.</i>

1:14:06.526 --> 1:14:09.237
<i>Metternich was sincere in quoting Hitler:</i>

1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:11.823
<i>The interests of conservators coincided</i>

1:14:11.906 --> 1:14:15.660
<i>with the ideology of a totalitarian state.</i>

1:14:16.369 --> 1:14:18.246
<i>A dangerous coincidence.</i>

1:14:23.543 --> 1:14:25.211
<i>My Lord Count...</i>

1:14:31.009 --> 1:14:32.677
My Lord Count,

1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:35.722
will you return the collections?

1:14:35.805 --> 1:14:37.307
No.
-So much the better.

1:14:37.390 --> 1:14:39.309
<i>How strange it is...</i>

1:14:39.392 --> 1:14:44.481
<i>that the fearsome machine
of a Nazi state got held up in Paris</i>

1:14:44.564 --> 1:14:48.651
<i>by the tacit resistance
of its own military officer.</i>

1:14:48.735 --> 1:14:53.198
<i>Ribbentrop demands the return
to Paris of the collection.</i>

1:14:53.281 --> 1:14:57.076
I am grateful to you for the fuel.
It was indispensable.

1:14:57.160 --> 1:14:58.745
Indispensable.

1:14:59.704 --> 1:15:03.374
<i>But Metternich,
citing bureaucratic procedure,</i>

1:15:03.458 --> 1:15:07.003
<i>continually postpones
executing these orders.</i>

1:15:08.046 --> 1:15:10.840
The description of what there is...

1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:16.554
<i>In the distant châteaux,
the treasures are safe</i>

1:15:16.638 --> 1:15:20.600
<i>from even the hands
of high-ranking art lovers,</i>

1:15:21.100 --> 1:15:23.228
<i>such as Hitler, Göring, Goebbels...</i>

1:15:27.398 --> 1:15:31.861
<i>The goals of slates and those of art
seldom coincide.</i>

1:15:44.791 --> 1:15:49.879
<i>An occupation:
one party is strong, one is weak.</i>

1:15:49.963 --> 1:15:51.548
<i>What is to be done?</i>

1:15:53.299 --> 1:15:55.343
<i>To grow, one into the other,</i>

1:15:55.426 --> 1:15:57.595
<i>conserving one's culture,</i>

1:15:57.679 --> 1:16:01.891
<i>so finally a common state
can be formed?</i>

1:16:01.975 --> 1:16:06.813
<i>The “French-German Union”,
or even, “German-French Union”.</i>

1:16:07.564 --> 1:16:10.650
<i>Finally, the warring will come to an end.</i>

1:16:11.317 --> 1:16:15.488
<i>There's only one enemy,
Bolshevik Russia.</i>

1:16:15.572 --> 1:16:17.574
VISIT
BOLSHEVISM AGAINST EUROPE

1:16:18.157 --> 1:16:19.742
Shot 15, sequence five, take one.

1:16:23.079 --> 1:16:24.581
<i>During the hard years
of the occupation,</i>

1:16:24.664 --> 1:16:29.335
<i>Jaujard was
under the supervision of Pétain</i>

1:16:29.419 --> 1:16:31.838
<i>and the control of German troops.</i>

1:16:31.921 --> 1:16:33.715
<i>But he kept the Louvre's staff,</i>

1:16:33.798 --> 1:16:36.884
<i>held exhibitions,</i>

1:16:37.802 --> 1:16:41.055
<i>and even made new acquisitions.</i>

1:16:41.139 --> 1:16:44.892
<i>Cinema was also made in France
during those years.</i>

1:16:49.856 --> 1:16:52.567
<i>Jaujard and Count Metternich.</i>

1:16:55.028 --> 1:16:58.948
<i>They couldn't be entirely open
with one another.</i>

1:17:08.374 --> 1:17:13.046
<i>Of course they didn't know
how long they'd live like this.</i>

1:17:19.886 --> 1:17:23.264
You have dark ideas.
-You're not too jolly yourself.

1:17:25.099 --> 1:17:30.313
<i>During wartime,
excessively hasty change is inevitable.</i>

1:17:39.572 --> 1:17:42.450
<i>Marshal Pétain speaks to France.</i>

1:17:42.950 --> 1:17:44.911
<i>Fellow Frenchmen...</i>

1:17:46.204 --> 1:17:48.665
Two of my colleagues are in trouble.

1:17:48.748 --> 1:17:50.917
I'm sure they're innocent.

1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:52.960
I need your assistance...

1:17:57.757 --> 1:18:00.718
As for the first case, I'll intervene,

1:18:07.809 --> 1:18:09.811
but as for the second...

1:18:11.938 --> 1:18:15.066
if she's in the hands of the Gestapo,

1:18:15.149 --> 1:18:16.984
there's nothing I can do.

1:18:20.238 --> 1:18:21.739
Since 1929,

1:18:21.823 --> 1:18:26.536
I've been in charge
of Rhenish cultural heritage,

1:18:26.619 --> 1:18:30.873
and here I am now,
curator for all Europe.

1:18:30.957 --> 1:18:34.168
They must think
I'm familiar with all things.

1:18:34.252 --> 1:18:38.506
But a life is at stake.
-I see who has ears to hear.

1:18:38.589 --> 1:18:40.591
Thank you.
-Shall we go?

1:18:51.519 --> 1:18:54.814
All my life
I've been around civil servants.

1:18:55.940 --> 1:19:00.528
I'm one myself.
-And France can be proud of you.

1:19:02.989 --> 1:19:07.493
M. Jaujard, you seem
permanently stressed.

1:19:08.286 --> 1:19:10.830
Does my uniform disturb you?

1:19:12.665 --> 1:19:15.752
<i>Gentlemen! Gentlemen, excuse me.</i>

1:19:15.835 --> 1:19:18.171
<i>May I speak with you?</i>

1:19:24.510 --> 1:19:26.429
Do you know him?
-A little.

1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:29.182
<i>Come in.</i>

1:19:29.849 --> 1:19:32.226
<i>This way. Come in.</i>

1:19:32.310 --> 1:19:34.187
<i>Hello, Mr. Metternich.</i>

1:19:36.731 --> 1:19:38.441
<i>There are two chairs...</i>

1:19:40.359 --> 1:19:42.779
<i>as if they were put there for us.</i>

1:19:53.873 --> 1:19:58.044
<i>Gentlemen, would you like
a glimpse into your future?</i>

1:19:59.212 --> 1:20:02.298
<i>Since you haven't said no,
I'll continue.</i>

1:20:02.799 --> 1:20:04.383
<i>M. Jaujard,</i>

1:20:04.467 --> 1:20:06.719
<i>in August 1944</i>

1:20:06.803 --> 1:20:10.181
<i>the independence of France
will be reestablished.</i>

1:20:10.264 --> 1:20:12.225
<i>Paris will be liberated.</i>

1:20:14.227 --> 1:20:18.314
<i>De Gaulle knows you've worked
with the Pétain regime,</i>

1:20:18.397 --> 1:20:22.985
<i>but he also knows
you supported the Resistance.</i>

1:20:23.069 --> 1:20:26.739
<i>You won't be punished, M. Jaujard,
but will be appointed...</i>

1:20:26.823 --> 1:20:30.201
<i>Director of the Department
of Arts and Literature.</i>

1:20:30.284 --> 1:20:34.956
<i>In 1959, you will receive
another state post:</i>

1:20:35.039 --> 1:20:38.334
<i>Head of the Ministry for Culture.</i>

1:20:38.417 --> 1:20:40.545
<i>You'll be elected to the Academy.</i>

1:20:40.628 --> 1:20:44.423
<i>Your third wife will be Jeanne Boitel,</i>

1:20:44.507 --> 1:20:48.302
<i>an actress who took
active part in the Resistance.</i>

1:20:48.386 --> 1:20:50.972
<i>You will have a son, François Xavier.</i>

1:20:51.472 --> 1:20:53.641
<i>He will not receive your love.</i>

1:20:54.141 --> 1:20:57.353
<i>You'll get another Legion of Honor.</i>

1:20:57.436 --> 1:21:02.358
<i>All your days will be devoted
to the administrative service of France,</i>

1:21:02.441 --> 1:21:05.319
<i>but one day you'll learn
from the papers</i>

1:21:05.403 --> 1:21:09.115
<i>that for some reason you've been fired.</i>

1:21:10.199 --> 1:21:15.413
<i>This will occur
in the incredibly distant year of 1967.</i>

1:21:19.792 --> 1:21:21.794
<i>Without any purpose left,</i>

1:21:21.878 --> 1:21:25.798
<i>you will leave this life a few days later.</i>

1:21:31.971 --> 1:21:34.348
<i>After your death, M. Jaujard,</i>

1:21:34.891 --> 1:21:40.104
<i>your record disappears
and only a few photos remain.</i>

1:21:41.522 --> 1:21:48.696
<i>I am unable to find anyone alive
who can say anything about you.</i>

1:22:17.183 --> 1:22:19.101
And the Louvre?

1:22:20.853 --> 1:22:23.189
<i>Count... Count?</i>

1:22:23.272 --> 1:22:25.441
<i>In 1942,</i>

1:22:25.524 --> 1:22:29.737
<i>you will be recalled to Germany,
relieved of your duties in Paris.</i>

1:22:29.820 --> 1:22:32.740
<i>This is of course
due to your excessive endeavors</i>

1:22:32.823 --> 1:22:35.451
<i>to preserve French culture.</i>

1:22:35.534 --> 1:22:39.330
<i>Hitler's state leaders
are displeased with you:</i>

1:22:39.413 --> 1:22:43.626
<i>You long prevented masterpieces
being exported to Germany.</i>

1:22:43.709 --> 1:22:47.088
<i>You will return to your native Rhineland,</i>

1:22:47.171 --> 1:22:49.507
<i>which will have suffered bombings.</i>

1:22:49.590 --> 1:22:54.220
<i>There will be much to rebuild.</i>

1:22:54.720 --> 1:22:56.222
<i>The war will soon end,</i>

1:22:56.305 --> 1:23:00.977
<i>and you'll be held responsible
for your membership in the Nazi party.</i>

1:23:01.060 --> 1:23:04.397
<i>Are you surprised
Germany lost the War?</i>

1:23:04.939 --> 1:23:06.857
<i>When did it ever win?</i>
