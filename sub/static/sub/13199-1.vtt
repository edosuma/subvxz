<i>Look at us.</i>

01:26.971 --> 01:28.996
<i>Running around,</i>

01:29.140 --> 01:33.634
<i>always rushed, always late.</i>

01:35.546 --> 01:38.208
<i>I guess that's why they call it
the human race.</i>

01:39.016 --> 01:42.577
<i>What we crave most in this world
is connection.</i>

01:42.987 --> 01:45.888
<i>And for some people,
it happens at first sight.</i>

01:46.023 --> 01:48.116
<i>It's when you know, you know.</i>

01:49.093 --> 01:51.425
<i>It's fate working its magic.</i>

01:53.764 --> 01:56.096
<i>And that's great for them.</i>

01:56.567 --> 01:58.899
<i>They get to live in a pop song.</i>

01:59.737 --> 02:01.364
<i>Ride the express train.</i>

02:03.674 --> 02:06.666
<i>But that's not the way it really works.</i>

02:12.183 --> 02:15.243
<i>For the rest of us,
it's a bit less romantic.</i>

02:16.420 --> 02:18.684
<i>It's complicated and it's messy.</i>

02:18.823 --> 02:22.691
<i>It's about horrible timing
and fumbled opportunities</i>

02:22.827 --> 02:27.423
<i>and not being able to say
what you need to say</i>

02:27.565 --> 02:29.760
<i>when you need to say it.</i>

02:30.768 --> 02:33.464
<i>At least, that's the way it was for me.</i>

02:34.605 --> 02:39.235
Taxi. Taxi driver. Taxi, taxi, taxi, taxi.

02:39.376 --> 02:42.834
Fat, pedaling, hooker-looking bitch.
Fat, pedaling, hooker-looking bitch.

02:43.414 --> 02:47.783
Fat, pedaling, hooker-looking bitch.
Fat, pedaling, hooker-looking bitch.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.943
Fat, pedaling...
Fat, pedaling, hooker-looking bitch.

02:50.087 --> 02:53.454
Pig-faced...
Pig-faced, gimpy, limping mama.

02:53.591 --> 02:55.354
Pig-faced, gimpy, limping mama.

02:55.893 --> 03:00.091
Pig-faced, gimpy, limping mama.
Pig-faced, gimpy, limping mama.

03:00.231 --> 03:03.723
I got a pig-faced...
Pig-faced, gimpy, limping mama.

03:03.868 --> 03:07.326
I've got a pig-faced, gimpy, limping mama
limping on by.

03:07.471 --> 03:10.201
Pig-faced... I've got a pig-faced...

03:10.341 --> 03:12.935
Man-boy. Little man-boy.
Beady-eyed little man-boy.

03:13.077 --> 03:15.773
Beady-eyed little...
Beady-eyed little man-boy.

03:15.913 --> 03:18.939
I see a beady-eyed little man-boy.

03:19.083 --> 03:21.381
Beady-eyed... Beady-eyed little man-boy.

03:21.518 --> 03:25.352
I see a beady-eyed...
Beady-eyed little man-boy looking at me.

03:25.489 --> 03:28.686
I got a beady-eyed little man-boy.
Beady-eyed little man-boy.

03:28.826 --> 03:31.158
Beady-eyed little man-boy
looking at me.

03:33.063 --> 03:36.123
I'm sorry about that.
You did say that was true.

03:43.674 --> 03:45.266
Sorry.

03:55.519 --> 03:57.919
You are not
a beady-eyed little man-child.

03:58.055 --> 04:00.319
"Boy," he distinctly said, okay?
And that's worse.

04:00.457 --> 04:03.392
And I am, I'm like a...
I'm a beady-eyed-looking little man-boy

04:03.527 --> 04:05.154
that shouldn't be wearing sweater vests.

04:05.296 --> 04:07.287
He was mentally ill,
standing on a street corner.

04:07.431 --> 04:09.592
Kassie, exactly.
He had no reason to be polite, okay?

04:09.733 --> 04:12.395
It was like a Tourette's-style
truth-serum affliction this guy had,

04:12.536 --> 04:14.060
and I was caught in the cross hairs.

04:14.204 --> 04:16.228
- I can't believe this stuff bothers you.
- It does.

04:16.373 --> 04:18.704
Now, I have some big news.
I wanna show you something.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.776
First I wanna show you something.
Check this out.

04:20.911 --> 04:22.538
- Look at that.
- What? What is that?

04:23.047 --> 04:25.174
I seem to have a growth.

04:25.316 --> 04:27.784
Oh, my God, is that your scrotum?

04:27.918 --> 04:31.046
- It's not a sunset.
- Ugh. You're exhausting.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.383
My health exhausts you?

04:33.524 --> 04:36.357
- Fine, we'll deal with my death later.
- My turn.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.551
- See this?
- Yeah.

04:37.695 --> 04:40.596
That's the dollar in yen.
I bought in a week ago.

04:40.731 --> 04:44.360
- Good for you. Now look at it like this.
- Yeah, sideways.

04:44.501 --> 04:47.470
If someone you knew owned this stock
what advice would you give them?

04:47.905 --> 04:50.931
I don't know, Kassie. I gotta look
at fundamentals, you know, P/E ratios.

04:51.075 --> 04:53.908
- Simple, simple. Hold or sell?
- You gotta sell that, it's going down.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.136
Exactly.

04:55.279 --> 04:58.339
This, Wally, this is what a woman's fertility
looks like after a certain age.

04:58.482 --> 04:59.540
So?

04:59.683 --> 05:01.981
So I would like you
to be the first to know

05:02.653 --> 05:03.881
I'm having a baby.

05:05.289 --> 05:09.623
- You're pregnant?
- No, not yet. But I'm working on it.

05:09.760 --> 05:13.321
Went to the doctor, she said all my levels
were really great, considering.

05:13.464 --> 05:17.491
And, uh, she said that my cervical mucus
is gorgeous, by the way.

05:17.634 --> 05:19.192
- Thanks for that.
- And, uh...

05:19.336 --> 05:21.429
Then she started giving me this lecture
about my age,

05:21.572 --> 05:24.097
and I was really starting to hear her
about timing and why wait?

05:25.442 --> 05:27.967
And, you know, I started...

05:28.112 --> 05:30.512
Would you please stop having sex
with food?

05:31.281 --> 05:33.078
Sorry, you know I don't know
when I do it.

05:33.217 --> 05:35.310
And then I thought to myself,
"I can do this."

05:35.452 --> 05:38.353
I've got a, you know,
killer new job at the network,

05:38.489 --> 05:40.150
and I don't need a man to have a baby.

05:40.290 --> 05:42.622
Technically speaking, you do.
Where's all this coming from?

05:42.760 --> 05:43.818
Is this about Paul?

05:43.961 --> 05:47.897
Why don't you chalk it up as another of
your disastrous flameouts and move on?

05:48.032 --> 05:49.932
This has absolutely nothing to do
with Paul.

05:50.067 --> 05:52.194
- I think it does.
- And thank you for bringing it up.

05:52.336 --> 05:54.361
All I'm saying is
don't kick that can down the road.

05:54.505 --> 05:57.633
You need to look at your relationships
instead of biting off the next step.

05:57.775 --> 05:59.504
- Deal with the one before.
- You know what?

05:59.643 --> 06:02.703
I'm just tired of thinking about
how this is supposed to go, all right?

06:02.846 --> 06:04.473
I'm just ready to do it now.

06:04.615 --> 06:06.606
- Really?
- Life is in session.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.677
- Is that from an infomercial?
- No.

06:09.820 --> 06:10.878
- Really?
- Yes.

06:11.021 --> 06:12.249
- Did you buy the DVD?
- One.

06:12.389 --> 06:15.187
But it really was something
that resonated with me.

06:15.325 --> 06:18.192
Wally, I don't...
You know what? I'm gonna do this.

06:18.328 --> 06:24.096
I want to have a kid,
and I am in the market for some...

06:24.234 --> 06:25.895
...semen.

06:26.437 --> 06:27.904
And...

06:30.207 --> 06:31.333
And?

06:34.244 --> 06:36.974
I need you to help me find some.

06:42.853 --> 06:44.821
So, what, are you gonna, like,
use a service?

06:44.955 --> 06:47.219
You gonna read résumés?
You know, all that stuff is crap.

06:47.357 --> 06:48.790
I heard about this woman in Queens,

06:48.926 --> 06:51.360
she thought she was buying the sperm
of an Ivy League athlete,

06:51.495 --> 06:53.019
turned out it came
from a homeless guy.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.824
Oh, you did not hear that.

06:55.232 --> 06:57.427
Kid turned out homeless.
She tried to sue and she lost.

06:57.568 --> 06:59.661
You just made all of that up.

06:59.803 --> 07:01.771
- Did I?
- Why are you even on this train?

07:01.905 --> 07:04.635
Because we're not nearly done talking
about this.

07:04.775 --> 07:06.367
Wally, you're a vortex.

07:06.510 --> 07:09.809
I have four interviews this week,
one of which I'm prepared for, okay?

07:09.947 --> 07:13.041
Listen. Now, what's wrong with my sperm,
by the way?

07:16.286 --> 07:18.846
- With your sperm?
- It works.

07:18.989 --> 07:20.684
Nothing.

07:21.425 --> 07:24.417
- I'm sure you have killer sperm.
- You're damn right.

07:24.561 --> 07:27.689
But, you know, we're best friends.
Isn't that weird? That'd be weird.

07:27.831 --> 07:29.560
- It is weird, you're right.
- That's weird.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.759
- You know what else? How do I put this?
- Careful.

07:31.902 --> 07:34.462
- You're a little neurotic, you know?
- I see.

07:34.605 --> 07:37.096
- Little self-absorbed and pessimistic.
- I got it.

07:37.241 --> 07:39.300
And I'm not pessimistic, sorry,
I'm a realist.

07:39.443 --> 07:41.377
- Big difference.
- Wally, this is not about you.

07:41.512 --> 07:43.412
And whether you can deal with this
or not...

07:43.547 --> 07:45.174
- Excuse me.
- Please don't say it.

07:45.315 --> 07:47.442
...life's in session.

07:50.687 --> 07:53.588
<i>She wouldn't know good
sperm if it slapped her in the face. Ugh.</i>

07:53.724 --> 07:55.316
What does she take you for, a eunuch?

07:55.459 --> 07:57.620
- You're jealous. It's perfectly normal.
- No, I'm not.

07:57.761 --> 08:00.286
This is bigtime primal stuff
you're dealing with, jungle stuff,

08:00.430 --> 08:01.920
and you have every right to be upset.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.659
She put you in the friend zone
six years ago, brother.

08:04.801 --> 08:06.291
That's a cold and inhospitable place

08:06.436 --> 08:08.165
where your manhood
is an endangered species.

08:08.305 --> 08:11.103
And now we're talking about your seed
getting devalued by her.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.176
Hey, so that we're clear,
she did not put me in the friend zone.

08:14.311 --> 08:16.336
We put each other in the friend zone.
It was mutual.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.742
Let's be honest with ourselves.

08:17.881 --> 08:19.246
You had your window with Kassie,

08:19.383 --> 08:21.408
and you went all Wally on her
and you doomed it.

08:21.552 --> 08:23.918
I went what?
Hey, what is that even supposed to mean?

08:24.054 --> 08:26.488
You shared too much too soon.
Quickest way to kill a romance.

08:26.623 --> 08:28.887
You gotta hide the crazy
at least through the appetizers.

08:29.026 --> 08:30.721
I see. So just so that I'm clear,

08:30.861 --> 08:33.385
which one of your three failed marriages
taught you that lesson?

08:33.530 --> 08:35.293
All three,
in their special and various ways.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.663
Exactly, so, okay,
I appreciate the kind advice, but I'm fine.

08:38.802 --> 08:39.860
- Are you? Are you?
- Yeah.

08:40.003 --> 08:43.234
Because I still don't know why the hell
you e-mailed me a picture of your armpit.

08:43.373 --> 08:46.570
I told you that I thought I had a growth.
And was it an armpit?

08:46.710 --> 08:48.803
Oh, golly, I hope so.

08:52.883 --> 08:55.852
- She's really ambitious, huh?
- I didn't think she was interested.

08:55.986 --> 08:58.477
Please tell me you didn't invite Wally.

08:58.622 --> 09:02.490
- Of course I did.
- Is he bringing that Internet girl?

09:02.626 --> 09:04.856
- No, she broke up with him.
- Shocker.

09:04.995 --> 09:08.328
Do you know I've had orgasms
that last longer than his relationships?

09:08.465 --> 09:10.956
Would you stop? Sorry.

09:11.335 --> 09:13.895
Okay, here are your talking points,
minister.

09:14.037 --> 09:17.234
Listen, I know that Wally
can be a bit blunt,

09:17.374 --> 09:20.036
but at least he tells it like it is,
you know what I mean?

09:20.177 --> 09:23.408
It's like when things get too intimate,
he gets... He walls up.

09:23.547 --> 09:27.950
But nobody... There's nobody I trust more.
I mean, he always has my back.

09:28.085 --> 09:29.313
Yeah, I get it, Kass.

09:29.453 --> 09:33.082
He's your BFF, he's a really good guy.
Totally undatable.

09:33.223 --> 09:36.249
Nobody is totally undatable. Come on.

09:36.393 --> 09:39.658
I mean, there's gotta be somebody
out there for him.

09:41.565 --> 09:43.226
Done.

09:44.067 --> 09:46.592
- Places.
- I hope this party doesn't suck.

09:49.139 --> 09:50.299
- Yup.
- All right.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.670
- You should have gotten Debbie a gift.
- Oh, come on.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.936
It's her 30th birthday.
She's really vulnerable.

09:55.078 --> 09:57.842
Pretending it's actually her 30th
is gonna be my gift to that old bag.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.342
Hey, so here's where I'm at.

10:00.484 --> 10:02.918
So I want a donor that I can meet,
you know?

10:03.053 --> 10:04.748
I want someone
whose eyes I can look into.

10:04.888 --> 10:07.152
I wanna be able to, you know,
shake his hand.

10:07.291 --> 10:09.782
And you can't do that
at a sperm bank, right?

10:09.926 --> 10:13.487
I also want it fresh, you know?
I don't really... I don't think I want it frozen.

10:13.630 --> 10:16.258
- Who wants frozen?
- Frozen's so refreshing, though.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.361
What kind of qualities
would you be shopping for?

10:19.503 --> 10:22.904
Uh, sense of humor is most important.

10:23.807 --> 10:26.935
Why do women always say that sense of
humor is always the most important thing?

10:27.077 --> 10:28.601
We all know that that's a lie.

10:29.479 --> 10:33.313
- Okay, so then height.
- No.

10:33.450 --> 10:37.386
But, you know, funny height.
Funny height.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.427
Come on, Wally Mars,
aren't you gonna dance with me?

10:54.571 --> 10:57.233
No, I'm not, birthday girl.

10:57.374 --> 11:01.071
- I'm not really feeling it tonight, you know?
- You are such a buzzkill.

11:01.445 --> 11:02.673
I don't wanna break your flow.

11:02.813 --> 11:04.940
You were doing a great job
of killing it over there.

11:05.082 --> 11:08.279
You dressed up for my party.
That's so nice.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.249
- You're welcome.
- Stripes.

11:12.322 --> 11:14.882
Okay, who's dancing with me?

11:15.892 --> 11:17.291
Just perfect. Ha, ha.

11:19.463 --> 11:22.261
Sounds good. It's a funny horror film?

11:22.399 --> 11:24.867
Well, it's a horror film meets, uh...

11:25.001 --> 11:28.459
Well, they haven't really made
an honest kickboxing film yet.

11:29.139 --> 11:30.470
That's so true.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.735
I hadn't thought about that,
but you're absolutely right.

11:33.877 --> 11:36.937
- That's...
- Hi. I'm bored. Let's get a kebab.

11:37.080 --> 11:41.744
Wally, this is Declan.
He's a, uh, writer-slash-director.

11:41.885 --> 11:43.716
- Hey, double threat.
- Hey, Wally.

11:43.854 --> 11:46.152
- This is one of my oldest friends.
- That's right.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.484
- He's an equities analyst. Ha, ha.
- Analyst.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.650
- Seriously, come with me.
- I think I'm gonna stay.

11:50.794 --> 11:51.852
- I don't think so.
- What?

11:51.995 --> 11:54.930
Hey, Wally, you, uh,
got any great stock tips for me?

11:55.065 --> 11:57.727
Oh, Declan, they're all, you know,
they're all going straight up.

11:57.868 --> 12:00.393
You want some free advice?
Go on margin, go strong, go long.

12:00.537 --> 12:01.936
- Let's do it.
- Go strong, go long?

12:02.072 --> 12:03.130
- That's right.
- Really?

12:03.273 --> 12:04.797
- Yup.
- You always tell me to get out.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.774
- Changed my mind. Let's go, one second.
- Short and fast.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.279
Oh, boy, you see that?
You just got finger-gunned.

12:10.414 --> 12:12.314
I heard it.

12:12.616 --> 12:16.347
- Come on. Please?
- Oh, God, what?

12:16.486 --> 12:19.216
- He's married.
- Divorced.

12:19.356 --> 12:21.483
- Then he's lying.
- How do you know that?

12:21.625 --> 12:23.923
There's a tan line on his finger
where his ring should be.

12:24.060 --> 12:25.118
What?

12:25.262 --> 12:27.287
You're not thinking of this guy
as a donor, are you?

12:27.431 --> 12:30.764
You know what? I don't know.
I don't know. I still might do it.

12:30.901 --> 12:33.734
What are you talking about?
Wait a sec, are you out of your mind?

12:33.870 --> 12:36.236
You're gonna let Captain Douche
be the father of your child?

12:36.373 --> 12:38.398
- That just locks it up for you?
- I don't know yet.

12:38.542 --> 12:39.873
All right.

12:41.278 --> 12:44.543
- I'll tell you what, you're on your own.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

12:53.457 --> 12:55.118
Okay.

12:58.895 --> 13:00.692
Wally.

13:01.431 --> 13:03.729
Wally. Wally!

13:05.769 --> 13:06.827
Wally!

13:10.407 --> 13:12.705
Declan, Declan, hey.

13:12.843 --> 13:14.504
Kassie left.

13:14.644 --> 13:16.635
- What?
- Yeah, Kassie had to go.

13:16.780 --> 13:18.008
Where?

13:18.148 --> 13:19.979
She had to go
to her dealer's house, okay?

13:20.116 --> 13:22.641
This guy's a little bit of a paranoid,
so she went by herself.

13:22.786 --> 13:24.344
She's gone to go pick up some drugs.

13:24.488 --> 13:27.719
Some ecstasy, bro,
and some Viagra, all right?

13:27.858 --> 13:29.849
And she digs you.

13:29.993 --> 13:32.757
- Ha, ha. She digs me.
- You bet your ass she digs you. It's on.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.888
It's on like "Donkey Kong," is actually
what she wanted me to say to you.

13:36.032 --> 13:39.490
Now, this is the address of the love shack,
and you gotta go right now.

13:39.636 --> 13:43.800
Go, seriously.
Establish a safe word too, okay?

13:45.675 --> 13:48.269
Wally! Come on.

13:48.612 --> 13:51.376
I cannot...
You sent him to Washington Heights?

13:51.515 --> 13:53.483
Yeah, Harlem's too gentrified.
I had to go higher.

13:53.617 --> 13:56.518
Wasn't even gonna go through with it.
It was just an idea.

13:56.653 --> 13:59.053
You know, I wanted to let it breathe.

13:59.189 --> 14:01.453
God, what's wrong...?
Why have you been so weird lately?

14:01.591 --> 14:02.990
- I haven't.
- Yeah, you have.

14:03.126 --> 14:05.287
- I don't think you should do it, you know.
- What?

14:05.428 --> 14:07.191
- The whole baby thing, all right?
- Stop it.

14:07.330 --> 14:09.457
- It's not right, it's not natural.
- Wally, stop.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.830
What if you meet someone tomorrow,
all right?

14:12.969 --> 14:14.129
Or like six months from now.

14:14.271 --> 14:17.866
You guys fall in love,
and by the time you realize it, it's too late.

14:18.008 --> 14:20.203
Why is this so hard for you to accept?

14:20.744 --> 14:22.211
Look, I'm not going to wait around

14:22.345 --> 14:25.212
for some version of this
that might never happen, okay?

14:25.348 --> 14:27.077
Look, this wasn't my plan either.

14:27.217 --> 14:29.185
I didn't grow up in Minnesota
dreaming of the day

14:29.319 --> 14:32.846
that I was gonna put an ad out
for a sperm donor on Craigslist.

14:32.989 --> 14:36.152
But I'm here and it's happening
and it's scary, and I can't count on you?

14:36.293 --> 14:40.354
I can't ask for your support without you
just spewing out constant judgments?

14:40.830 --> 14:42.695
You're supposed to be my friend.

14:42.832 --> 14:45.392
Well, yeah.

14:52.609 --> 14:55.237
I think we should take some time.

14:55.378 --> 14:57.243
I think we need a timeout.

14:58.415 --> 15:00.246
Already learning
how to speak Mommy, huh?

15:03.853 --> 15:06.515
Wow. Taxi.

15:07.958 --> 15:09.357
See you later.

15:15.398 --> 15:18.925
I'm not just your friend.
Debbie Epstein's your friend.

15:25.041 --> 15:27.601
Look at you. Somebody chasing you?

15:28.445 --> 15:30.709
- Dude.
- Yup.

15:31.948 --> 15:34.974
- Let me guess, Kassie issues?
- No, no, there's no issue.

15:35.118 --> 15:36.779
We haven't seen each other for a week.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.683
- She says we're on a timeout.
- Timeout?

15:38.822 --> 15:40.414
- Yeah.
- Timeout?

15:40.557 --> 15:43.082
What are you, 6?
You didn't share your animal crackers?

15:43.226 --> 15:44.523
Grown-ups don't go on timeouts.

15:44.661 --> 15:46.925
Grown-ups have sex
with their lady friends, Mars.

15:47.063 --> 15:51.159
Okay, you're eating a chocolate bar
on two.

15:51.301 --> 15:54.395
It's not on two. It's certainly not on two.
And I needed just a little energy.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.232
- And I'm in the fat-burning zone.
- Right.

15:56.373 --> 15:59.035
You're burning muscle.
This is how you burn fat.

17:07.010 --> 17:10.275
<i>- Aloha. Ha, ha.
- Hi. Oh, ha, ha.</i>

17:10.413 --> 17:12.243
So sweet.

17:13.916 --> 17:16.784
Can I just do it then?
You're busy. Okay?

17:16.920 --> 17:21.323
Well, this is confusing.
One more of these. I got it.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.222
Cool if I did this by myself?
Picking up on your eyes.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.794
- Hey, Wally, want me to top off?
- Hi. No, thanks, I'm good.

17:26.930 --> 17:28.157
- Some bubbly?
- No, thank you.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.027
I'm gonna stick
with the hard stuff tonight.

17:30.166 --> 17:32.566
Hey, so who does this?
A party for insemination?

17:32.702 --> 17:36.331
- Is there even a doctor here, Debbie?
- Yes, Dr. Orensen.

17:38.241 --> 17:41.472
That guy?
Does he, like, practice out of a camper?

17:41.611 --> 17:43.203
He's progressive.

17:43.580 --> 17:47.072
This whole night was my idea.
It's how everybody's doing it these days.

17:47.217 --> 17:50.311
And Kassie's gonna go in the other room,
we're all gonna leave,

17:50.453 --> 17:54.651
and she's gonna, like,
do the deed with this big baster.

17:55.091 --> 17:57.559
Shouldn't that be cleaned
or something?

17:57.694 --> 18:00.094
- Why is it up here?
- I'm messing with you.

18:00.230 --> 18:02.095
- Oh.
- Ha, ha. Wally, you're so funny.

18:02.232 --> 18:03.722
Debbie, knock that off.

18:03.867 --> 18:05.198
She's gonna use a medical device.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.303
But, you know,
it's basically the same thing.

18:07.437 --> 18:09.098
- It goes in and out.
- Mm-hm.

18:09.706 --> 18:11.367
Charming.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.944
Wally, what is wrong with you?
You have, like, this negative...

18:15.078 --> 18:18.172
All these negative ions
that pop off like fleas.

18:18.314 --> 18:21.715
- Here, try this, it'll make you less anxious.
- What's this?

18:21.851 --> 18:24.183
I stole them from my mother.

18:24.721 --> 18:26.552
They're herbal.

18:27.223 --> 18:30.021
But they might as well
be pharmaceutical.

18:30.160 --> 18:34.221
- If I take one, will you walk away?
- I should change the guacamole.

18:34.364 --> 18:37.731
You know when it goes from green
to brown, like, ugh, that putrid...?

18:37.867 --> 18:40.131
Kind of like your sweater.

18:40.270 --> 18:42.295
- Debbie.
- All right.

19:07.597 --> 19:09.565
Unbelievable.

19:15.171 --> 19:17.002
Come on.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.040
This is a strange one, huh?

19:22.178 --> 19:24.840
- Only Kassie would do it like this.
- Yeah?

19:24.981 --> 19:27.142
- I don't know her that well.
- No?

19:27.283 --> 19:29.979
- Can I get you a drink?
- Uh, yes, you sure can.

19:31.354 --> 19:33.345
Thanks, bartender. I'm Wally.

19:33.489 --> 19:36.356
Roland. I'm the, uh, donor.

19:38.528 --> 19:40.325
Yeah.

19:40.463 --> 19:41.794
- Roland, the donor.
- Yeah.

19:41.931 --> 19:46.334
I am... I am Wally, the best friend.
Kassie's best friend.

19:46.469 --> 19:49.927
Oh. That's okay.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.067
Great.

19:52.208 --> 19:54.836
- Hi.
- Ahem. Hi.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.138
I feel like the prized hog.

20:02.318 --> 20:06.618
Bet you're used to that, huh?
Hey, let me ask you a question. Um...

20:06.756 --> 20:08.280
Uh, why are you doing this?

20:10.093 --> 20:11.492
We could use the money.

20:11.928 --> 20:14.328
- We?
- Yeah, my wife and I.

20:14.464 --> 20:17.058
Yeah, she's right over there.

20:18.001 --> 20:20.401
- Wow, she's beautiful.
- Yeah, thank you.

20:20.536 --> 20:22.163
Mm-hm, she's the...

20:22.305 --> 20:25.172
She's the light of my life. She is, uh...
She's my soul mate.

20:25.308 --> 20:28.300
Oh, man. Is she...? I'll bet...
Is she the wind under your wings?

20:28.444 --> 20:29.502
- Yeah.
- Right, I get it.

20:29.646 --> 20:32.410
Yeah. Yeah, so it gets a little tough
on a teacher's salary.

20:32.548 --> 20:34.209
I'm an assistant professor at Columbia.

20:34.350 --> 20:36.841
I teach a course
on feminist literary tradition.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.112
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

20:38.254 --> 20:39.812
Okay.

20:41.257 --> 20:44.090
- It's game time. You ready?
- Uh, okay.

20:44.227 --> 20:47.924
Pick out a nice room,
put everything, well, you know.

20:48.064 --> 20:50.999
Duty calls. Good talking to you, Wally.

20:53.069 --> 20:54.502
Isn't he great?

20:54.637 --> 20:58.232
- Make way. It's happening, people.
- All right, all right. No pressure.

21:13.456 --> 21:14.855
Hi.

21:14.991 --> 21:17.357
I just met your Viking.

21:18.027 --> 21:21.258
- Gorgeous, isn't he?
- Yeah, delicious.

21:27.804 --> 21:29.066
What's going on in here?

21:30.006 --> 21:32.065
- Truth?
- Mm-hm.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.267
I'm freaking out.

21:34.677 --> 21:40.946
I really thought that throwing a party
would, you know, make it fun, but it's...

21:41.751 --> 21:44.515
It's just really depressing.

21:45.254 --> 21:47.154
Come on.

21:47.991 --> 21:49.982
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

21:51.794 --> 21:57.096
I think that you wanna have a child,
and I think that that's natural.

21:58.701 --> 22:00.726
You're not nuts.

22:02.638 --> 22:04.572
You're okay.

22:06.242 --> 22:08.107
Thank you.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.768
- Oh, Wally, thank you.
- All right.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.709
- You get it, don't you?
- I get it.

22:11.848 --> 22:14.112
- You get it.
- Yeah.

22:23.793 --> 22:27.661
Okay, where's my crown? Oh.

22:30.166 --> 22:33.101
Okay. I'm gonna be fine.

22:33.236 --> 22:35.329
I'm just a little emotional.

22:36.272 --> 22:37.933
Crown looks fantastic.

22:39.442 --> 22:41.069
Bye.

22:48.317 --> 22:51.081
Let's do a toast. Okay, you guys.

22:52.855 --> 22:54.516
- Are you all ready?
- Yeah.

22:54.657 --> 23:00.152
Before we get down
to the nitty-gritty and kick you all out,

23:00.797 --> 23:03.823
I just wanted to make a toast
to our donor, Roland.

23:05.168 --> 23:06.362
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

23:06.502 --> 23:08.367
Roland, where are you?
The man of our night.

23:08.504 --> 23:11.371
Right there. There he is. Roland.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.736
- How'd it go in there?
- Uh...

23:16.279 --> 23:17.541
Debbie.

23:17.680 --> 23:24.552
I also wanna make a toast to our Kassie,
why we're all here.

23:24.687 --> 23:27.520
You're an inspiration to all of us.

23:27.657 --> 23:29.682
You are taking the bull by the horns.

23:29.826 --> 23:34.320
You're Venus,
and we're doing it, you know?

23:34.464 --> 23:36.694
So to Kassie.

23:36.833 --> 23:39.700
It's amazing.
We're doing it for ourselves.

23:39.836 --> 23:41.098
Yeah, Kassie!

23:43.306 --> 23:46.469
Oh, my God, you... You're kidding.

23:46.609 --> 23:50.602
I didn't even plan this. This is cosmic.

23:53.249 --> 23:54.307
Hey, Wally.

23:58.154 --> 23:59.678
Come here, come here.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.862
Yes, I'm in here.

24:14.003 --> 24:18.064
- Maybe use the other bathroom.
- All right.

24:46.836 --> 24:49.202
Pff, Kassie.

25:22.605 --> 25:26.063
Oh. Yeah.

25:35.952 --> 25:38.216
- Somebody in there?
- I'm in here.

25:38.354 --> 25:40.185
Okay, sorry.

27:29.432 --> 27:32.299
- Hey.
- Ah. Hey, my head. Please.

27:32.868 --> 27:35.200
You're fired. You're falling apart.

27:35.338 --> 27:38.637
- What the hell was that last night?
- What are you talking about?

27:38.774 --> 27:43.074
Showing up at my place
at 3 in the morning completely drunk?

27:43.212 --> 27:47.205
- Plastered? What is that?
- Whoa, whoa, what?

27:47.650 --> 27:49.242
I was at your place last night?

27:49.385 --> 27:53.116
Yes, and talking some scary
mumbiddy-jumbiddy.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.314
I had nightmares after that, man.

27:55.458 --> 27:57.756
What...? What was I saying?

27:57.893 --> 28:03.525
Oh, I don't know, some wild mutterings
about risky trade,

28:03.666 --> 28:08.797
Vikings, and, I don't know,
the music of it was foul and sinister.

28:08.938 --> 28:10.838
Gave me the willies,
gave me the heebie-jeebies.

28:10.973 --> 28:13.032
Very dark, really. Very disturbing.

28:13.175 --> 28:16.338
I loaded you into a car service pretty quick.
Forty bucks, my treat.

28:17.246 --> 28:19.646
- Leonard, I don't remember any of that.
- What?

28:21.150 --> 28:22.208
How can you not...?

28:22.351 --> 28:25.684
You don't recall at one point, uh,
barking out the name Diane Sawyer?

28:25.821 --> 28:29.484
"Diane Sawyer!"
You don't remember that? At all?

28:29.625 --> 28:31.149
<i>Diane Sawyer
from Good Morning America?</i>

28:31.293 --> 28:34.319
Yeah. By the way, she's always been
quite comely, hasn't she?

28:34.463 --> 28:36.829
Creamy complexion. Mm.

28:36.966 --> 28:39.457
I think she was
a Miss, uh, Something-or-Other.

28:39.902 --> 28:44.396
I went to Kassie's party,
and after that, uh...

28:45.608 --> 28:47.872
I guess I must have blacked out.

28:48.577 --> 28:50.909
- Blacked out?
- Yeah.

28:51.046 --> 28:53.480
Well, you threw up in my hallway
like a college girl.

28:54.083 --> 28:57.814
You seriously don't remember any of it?

28:58.187 --> 29:00.246
No, zero.

29:00.389 --> 29:02.050
Well, I'm telling you, you need help.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.018
So nice, so nice.

29:10.533 --> 29:13.161
Diane Sawyer?

29:15.037 --> 29:21.340
For murder, though it have no tongue,
will speak with most miraculous organ.

29:22.044 --> 29:24.205
The play's the thing

29:24.580 --> 29:29.108
Wherein I'll catch the conscience
of the King.

29:35.891 --> 29:37.756
Ugh. Do we have to see the second half?

29:37.893 --> 29:39.861
- Come on, it gets better.
- Do you promise?

29:41.297 --> 29:44.289
I'm not even making a joke.
I mean, it's really unbelievable in there.

29:44.433 --> 29:46.765
I mean, what is this guy
trying to prove, Kassie?

29:46.902 --> 29:48.961
Oh, please.
I thought it was extremely powerful.

29:49.104 --> 29:50.401
- Thank you.
- It's not powerful.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.439
It's like introducing a new character,
you know?

29:52.575 --> 29:59.777
A very small, unsettling, uh,
character that, um, you know, frankly...

29:59.915 --> 30:01.041
I'm pregnant.

30:02.651 --> 30:05.245
- that is gonna make the king less inclined
to hear this guy out.

30:05.387 --> 30:08.015
I mean, he's not wearing any pants.
It's unnecessary.

30:08.157 --> 30:10.091
Did you hear what I just said?

30:12.394 --> 30:13.918
Yeah.

30:17.933 --> 30:19.059
<i>She went on to tell me</i>

30:19.201 --> 30:20.896
<i>that she was moving back home
to Minnesota.</i>

30:21.036 --> 30:23.561
New York City is no place to raise a child.

30:24.139 --> 30:28.576
<i>Something about a better place
to raise a kid and loving grandparents.</i>

30:30.846 --> 30:32.871
<i>It ruined the second act for me,
which was a bummer</i>

30:33.015 --> 30:35.745
<i>because the naked guy
ended up killing a bunch of people</i>

30:35.885 --> 30:37.375
<i>and the play got pretty good.</i>

30:40.356 --> 30:42.790
<i>Two weeks later, Kassie left.</i>

30:42.925 --> 30:45.655
<i>She got a little choked up
as the moving trucks pulled away,</i>

30:46.595 --> 30:49.689
<i>probably sensing what a gigantic mistake
she was making with her life.</i>

30:51.333 --> 30:54.700
<i>She bought me an Airedale terrier,
who I love.</i>

30:54.837 --> 30:57.897
<i>I had to have my floors redone
after one month.</i>

30:58.274 --> 31:01.471
<i>What do people see in dogs?
They're worse than babies.</i>

31:04.113 --> 31:06.206
<i>We promised to stay in touch,
but who are we kidding?</i>

31:06.348 --> 31:09.840
<i>She was a single mom,
and I lived in New York.</i>

31:10.553 --> 31:15.252
<i>There were Christmas cards and e-mails
but not much else.</i>

31:48.290 --> 31:51.157
<i>And after seven years,</i>

31:51.293 --> 31:53.818
<i>two failed relationships,</i>

31:53.963 --> 31:58.832
<i>one stock-market crash,
and numerous blind dates,</i>

31:58.968 --> 32:00.731
<i>there I was,</i>

32:00.869 --> 32:03.064
<i>right where Kassie left me.</i>

32:03.205 --> 32:06.299
You know, when my friend told me
you were still single, I couldn't believe it.

32:06.442 --> 32:07.500
Yep, well...

32:07.643 --> 32:10.612
So you gonna try to take me off the market
on the first date, Pauline?

32:11.614 --> 32:14.549
Yes, I am thinking a June wedding.

32:14.683 --> 32:16.583
And then we'll move out
to the suburbs, huh?

32:17.219 --> 32:21.246
- Okay. Um, New Jersey?
- Great. Easy commute.

32:21.390 --> 32:24.791
Course, I have to work a ton
to afford that second house.

32:26.195 --> 32:28.254
Although that could end up
just being an excuse.

32:28.397 --> 32:30.456
I might just be hiding from, you know,

32:30.599 --> 32:35.798
the ever-growing tedium
of New Jersey drudgery.

32:37.339 --> 32:39.899
Which will then create
some sort of resentment in you.

32:40.042 --> 32:42.875
But you seem like the kind of person
that would internalize that, right?

32:43.012 --> 32:44.980
But, you know, you would act out

32:45.114 --> 32:47.776
in some sort
of self-destructive manner later.

32:47.916 --> 32:49.440
That's me.

32:49.585 --> 32:51.951
And I'm the kind of person
that would blame myself for that

32:52.087 --> 32:54.817
and probably end up
scheduling even more work out of town

32:54.957 --> 32:56.652
to deal with the guilt.

32:57.359 --> 32:59.054
Once I'm out of town,
I'm stuck in a hotel,

32:59.194 --> 33:01.059
I gotta masturbate incessantly
to the Internet,

33:01.196 --> 33:05.758
and you're probably back home
with some afternoon drinking problem.

33:05.901 --> 33:08.529
And I'm gonna end up
a pathetic 50-year-old bachelor

33:08.671 --> 33:11.970
wearing 300-dollar jeans
at a turnpike nightclub,

33:12.107 --> 33:14.667
speaking to women
I should not be speaking to

33:14.810 --> 33:15.868
because they're too young.

33:20.449 --> 33:22.644
Or it could all work out great.

33:25.788 --> 33:30.418
Absolutely unbelievable.
What was I thinking?

33:30.559 --> 33:35.792
Just shut up and smile.
No good ever comes from you talking.

33:35.931 --> 33:38.559
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

33:38.701 --> 33:40.601
<i>Hey, Wally, it's Kassie.</i>

33:40.736 --> 33:43.398
<i>Guess what.
We are moving back to New York.</i>

33:43.539 --> 33:47.635
<i>I got an amazing offer from ABC,
and I found a great school for Sebastian.</i>

33:47.776 --> 33:49.869
<i>He's already practicing his accent.</i>

33:50.012 --> 33:54.608
<i>Now, call me. This is very exciting.
Okay, bye.</i>

34:02.491 --> 34:05.858
Yeah, well, listen,
I was thinking that, uh, after dinner,

34:05.994 --> 34:09.054
maybe we should go by that, uh, wine bar
that we love to hate.

34:09.197 --> 34:11.893
You know, I think that cheesy old maître d'
that always hit on you,

34:12.034 --> 34:14.831
<i>- I think he's still alive.
- Oh, God, how old is he?</i>

34:14.969 --> 34:16.369
<i>A hundred and fifteen by now.</i>

34:17.706 --> 34:20.402
Actually, Sebastian prefers
only hard alcohol.

34:20.909 --> 34:23.139
Sebastian, huh?

34:23.277 --> 34:26.714
<i>- Not just gonna be you and me?
- What, you don't wanna see him?</i>

34:26.849 --> 34:27.940
Come on. And you know what?

34:28.083 --> 34:30.574
You should actually get him something,
like a little gift.

34:30.953 --> 34:33.547
<i>- Nothing big.
- A small gift, nothing big, huh?</i>

34:33.688 --> 34:37.216
Okay, well, I'll get him, um...

34:37.359 --> 34:39.293
I'll get him...
How about I get him a basketball?

34:39.428 --> 34:41.589
<i>Actually, you know, he's not that athletic.</i>

34:43.599 --> 34:46.591
- Well, then what should I get him?
- He collects picture frames.

34:46.735 --> 34:50.226
<i>- Picture frames?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's weird, I know.</i>

34:50.371 --> 34:53.899
<i>- And he doesn't put pictures in them.
- Uh, wow.</i>

34:54.042 --> 34:55.509
<i>That is very unusual, Kassie.</i>

34:55.643 --> 34:57.578
<i>- Debbie's here. She says hi.
- Does she?</i>

34:57.713 --> 34:59.305
She's helping me unpack.

34:59.448 --> 35:02.008
Oh, she made a dreamcatcher.

35:02.151 --> 35:04.381
It's just... I don't know.
We'll see, we'll just...

35:04.520 --> 35:08.923
So listen, um,
I will see you tonight, okay?

35:09.057 --> 35:13.323
Oh, yeah, Wally,
thank you for rejecting my friend request.

35:13.462 --> 35:14.520
Did you get that?

35:14.663 --> 35:17.325
You can tell Debbie
that it was all part of my master plan

35:17.466 --> 35:19.127
to get her completely out of my life.

35:19.601 --> 35:21.728
Right. I cannot tell her that.

35:21.870 --> 35:23.667
<i>- Yeah, all right.
- Okay, see you later.</i>

35:23.806 --> 35:24.898
<i>Okay.</i>

35:50.265 --> 35:52.699
Hi, I'm looking for a young lady that, uh...

35:52.835 --> 35:55.269
Oh, got it, right there.

36:03.679 --> 36:05.772
Pardon me, miss?

36:06.415 --> 36:07.814
Wow.

36:07.950 --> 36:09.713
Hi.

36:11.486 --> 36:13.317
- You look great.
- Look at you.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.251
Who took over dressing you?

36:17.392 --> 36:21.522
- Nobody. What are you talking about?
- Come on. I like it.

36:21.663 --> 36:23.824
- How's Sebastian? Where is he?
- Oh, he's over there.

36:23.966 --> 36:25.456
But listen, if he's a little strange,

36:25.601 --> 36:28.798
it's just he's having some
adjustment issues to the move, so...

36:28.937 --> 36:30.632
But he's watching the fish.

36:33.842 --> 36:38.142
- I think he's gonna be just fine.
- Matthew, come on, it's time to go.

36:54.563 --> 36:56.793
I think I have cyclothymic disorder.

36:57.266 --> 36:59.734
I looked right at the shark
and felt nothing.

36:59.868 --> 37:03.304
Honey, I don't know what that is,
but I'm sure you don't have it.

37:03.438 --> 37:06.498
Sweetie, this is Uncle Wally. Say hi.

37:06.642 --> 37:09.372
- Hi.
- Hi, Sebastian.

37:09.511 --> 37:13.003
Cyclothymic disorder:
emotional ups and downs,

37:13.148 --> 37:18.245
hyperactivity, loss of interest
and/or pleasure, lack of sexual drive.

37:18.387 --> 37:21.254
Okay, was I not clear about WebMD?

37:21.390 --> 37:24.086
Sebastian, now, look,
Wally has a gift for you.

37:24.226 --> 37:27.923
- Let's see what he got you.
- Yes, I do. Take a look at this.

37:29.197 --> 37:34.157
That's so sweet, Wally, very sweet.

37:34.303 --> 37:36.032
Oh, wow.

37:41.009 --> 37:43.034
It's a Lunt Silver Edition.

37:47.215 --> 37:49.809
- Where's the picture?
- What picture?

37:49.952 --> 37:54.013
The one that comes with the frame.
It's the most important part.

37:55.624 --> 37:58.889
- What?
- This frame's used.

38:01.330 --> 38:02.388
Say thank you.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.859
- Thanks.
- You got it.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.367
Look at this. Okay, guys.
Here's a big surprise.

38:08.503 --> 38:10.767
I called ahead on the phone,
I pre-ordered this.

38:10.906 --> 38:14.672
Are you ready for the best duck
in the whole wide world? Huh?

38:14.810 --> 38:18.143
- I can't eat duck.
- What do you mean, you can't eat duck?

38:18.280 --> 38:21.716
Wally, do you know what they do to ducks
at the waterfowl farms?

38:21.850 --> 38:25.411
No, no, sweetie, I think that's veal.
You're thinking of veal.

38:25.554 --> 38:28.751
No, I read about the ducks too.

38:28.890 --> 38:31.757
They force-feed the ducks
7 pounds of food a day

38:31.893 --> 38:34.191
through a plastic tube
they drill into their throats.

38:34.329 --> 38:37.127
I called on the phone, I pre-ordered this.

38:37.265 --> 38:39.529
The ducks get this liver disease
called hepatic lipidosis

38:39.668 --> 38:40.794
and they can't walk.

38:41.236 --> 38:45.730
Nature's in crisis,
and there's only one mammal to blame.

38:48.010 --> 38:49.500
What's going on here?
What do you got?

38:50.479 --> 38:51.810
He's stubborn.

38:52.881 --> 38:54.007
Hey, guess what.

38:54.149 --> 38:55.639
This cost me $84,

38:55.784 --> 38:58.309
and it's gonna be about
the best culinary treat you've ever had.

38:58.453 --> 38:59.977
I won't do it, Uncle Wally.

39:00.122 --> 39:02.818
- And I'll hate you if you do.
- Okay, let's not...

39:02.958 --> 39:06.359
We don't say "hate," sweetie.
We don't say "hate."

39:06.995 --> 39:08.656
Okay?

39:09.431 --> 39:13.197
- We can have rice with soy sauce.
- Great, rice with soy sauce.

39:13.635 --> 39:17.765
That's a great compromise.
Uncle Wally loves rice.

39:18.340 --> 39:19.602
He likes you.

39:20.008 --> 39:23.307
- You're kidding, right?
- No, that's like for him, it is.

39:23.445 --> 39:24.969
Hey, listen, will you do me a favor?

39:25.113 --> 39:27.308
Would you watch him
for a couple hours this weekend?

39:27.449 --> 39:29.110
- I don't think...
- No, it is, here.

39:29.251 --> 39:32.550
See, I have to go to a parent, um,
orientation thing at his school.

39:32.687 --> 39:34.678
It would really help me out.

39:34.823 --> 39:37.656
I also think it would be good for you guys
to spend some time together,

39:37.793 --> 39:39.818
you know, a little get-to-know-me time.

39:40.962 --> 39:42.395
Hi, excuse me.

39:42.531 --> 39:46.729
Hi, could I get a soda
on the rocks, uh, for myself

39:46.868 --> 39:48.836
and, uh, some steamed vegetables?

39:58.480 --> 40:00.675
- Sorry about that, Wally.
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

40:00.816 --> 40:02.306
I'll expense it, okay?

40:02.451 --> 40:05.716
And I'll, uh, just cut it up
and put it in my cereal.

40:05.854 --> 40:08.880
- It's better than bananas.
- Ooh, that sounds delicious.

40:09.024 --> 40:10.992
The neck is sort of, you know,
shaped like banana,

40:11.126 --> 40:12.650
so it'll slice up nice.

40:13.195 --> 40:14.890
Honey, stay close.

40:15.030 --> 40:17.658
- Isn't he great?
- Oh, my gosh.

40:17.799 --> 40:20.563
- He thinks I'm a lesbian.
- What?

40:20.702 --> 40:25.696
I guess the only mothers he knows
with seed guys for fathers are lesbians.

40:25.841 --> 40:27.331
Mom.

40:27.809 --> 40:30.277
- Can I go in?
- No, sweetie, we've gotta get home.

40:30.912 --> 40:32.470
He's so smart and willful,

40:32.614 --> 40:36.175
and he considers everything,
and it's just never boring.

40:36.318 --> 40:40.118
- He went in.
- I know, he does that.

40:44.926 --> 40:46.860
What's a... What's a seed guy?

40:46.995 --> 40:50.624
Uh, that's his... Part of his birth story.

40:51.233 --> 40:52.564
This should be good.

40:52.701 --> 40:56.296
It's the story I've been telling him
about how he got here.

40:56.905 --> 40:59.999
I told him that Mommy
didn't have a husband

41:00.142 --> 41:04.909
but wanted you so very, very much
that she couldn't wait another day.

41:05.413 --> 41:09.372
And so she went to the doctor,
and the doctor said,

41:09.518 --> 41:12.976
"If you go out into the world
and you look very, very hard,

41:13.421 --> 41:18.449
you'll find a very special person who,
if you ask very nicely,

41:18.593 --> 41:19.958
will give you seeds,"

41:20.729 --> 41:22.993
so that I can plant you in my tummy.

41:23.131 --> 41:24.758
Got it.

41:25.300 --> 41:27.598
But I... You know, I've read all the books

41:27.736 --> 41:30.227
about how you're supposed to talk
about this stuff,

41:30.372 --> 41:34.433
and until it happens,
nothing can prepare you for the day

41:34.576 --> 41:36.305
when your kid comes home crying
after school

41:36.444 --> 41:39.743
because some lard-ass
called him a science experiment.

41:47.088 --> 41:49.249
Okay, I'm gonna go in.

41:55.764 --> 41:56.992
Thank you.

42:02.237 --> 42:05.866
- Who was that?
- A text. Text from Roland.

42:07.342 --> 42:11.608
- Who's Roland?
- The seed guy. The donor.

42:13.481 --> 42:17.440
- You still talk to him?
- Yeah. Well, I called him when I got back.

42:17.586 --> 42:18.644
Why? What for?

42:18.787 --> 42:21.688
Well, there's a reason I didn't want
the donor to be anonymous.

42:21.823 --> 42:24.223
You know, so that when Sebastian
started asking questions,

42:24.359 --> 42:26.088
I would have answers.

42:26.228 --> 42:28.628
And I'd like to get to know this guy.

42:28.763 --> 42:30.958
You know,
someday I think I'd like them to meet.

42:31.099 --> 42:33.329
Okay, what's Mrs. Roland gonna think
about all of this?

42:33.468 --> 42:37.063
There isn't a Mrs. Roland.
They got a divorce.

42:41.376 --> 42:45.813
So I'm very sorry
to hear about your divorce, by the way.

42:45.947 --> 42:48.415
Oh. Thank you.

42:48.550 --> 42:50.347
Don't worry, it's, uh...

42:50.485 --> 42:52.851
I won't get into how the marriage ended.

42:52.988 --> 42:56.754
I don't wanna bore you with the details
of how she cheated on me.

42:56.891 --> 42:59.257
- Oh.
- Let's just say it's gonna be a long time

42:59.394 --> 43:03.262
before I can trust anyone
involved in the instruction of Pilates.

43:03.398 --> 43:06.026
We'll just leave it at that.

43:06.668 --> 43:08.898
Yeah, okay, fair enough.

43:11.573 --> 43:16.840
So listen, you're under no obligation
to do anything.

43:16.978 --> 43:19.412
And I know that you didn't expect
to do anything

43:19.547 --> 43:22.209
other than, um, you know, donating.

43:22.350 --> 43:26.150
Uh, which you did so wonderfully,
by the way.

43:26.288 --> 43:27.983
- I don't mean that to sound like...
- Kass.

43:28.123 --> 43:30.557
You know what I meant.
I just meant for future, down the road,

43:30.692 --> 43:32.319
- if he starts to ask questions...
- Kass.

43:32.460 --> 43:33.859
Mm-hm?

43:34.462 --> 43:36.453
I was honored to receive your call.

43:37.332 --> 43:38.390
Really?

43:38.533 --> 43:43.903
I always wondered about this, you know,
him and you and how it turned out.

43:44.039 --> 43:45.131
I mean, you know...

43:45.273 --> 43:48.106
Roland, would you like to see
a picture of him?

43:49.110 --> 43:51.772
- I would love that.
- Would you?

43:53.048 --> 43:55.812
- Ready?
- Let me see.

43:55.950 --> 43:57.315
Oh.

43:58.420 --> 43:59.478
He's beautiful.

44:00.655 --> 44:01.713
Isn't he?

44:02.123 --> 44:05.422
I gotta say, Kass,

44:05.560 --> 44:09.656
I see a lot more of me in him than you.

44:11.399 --> 44:12.457
Wow.

44:12.600 --> 44:16.229
Hey, I didn't get to say this
to you back then, but I really respect you.

44:16.938 --> 44:20.135
Your choice,
in doing this the way that you did.

44:20.809 --> 44:22.709
It took a lot of guts.

44:22.844 --> 44:27.577
It was courageous,
and I simply don't see that out there.

44:29.484 --> 44:33.181
- What?
- No, nothing. It's just...

44:34.889 --> 44:37.915
That's a really kind thing to say.

44:38.993 --> 44:40.483
Well, it's true.

44:42.464 --> 44:47.333
Well, this went...
This went a lot better than I expected.

44:47.469 --> 44:48.663
Yeah, for me too.

44:49.437 --> 44:50.995
Yeah.

44:54.542 --> 44:56.169
- Coffee hot?
- Yes.

45:05.153 --> 45:08.520
I've always found penguins
a bit of a mystery.

45:09.724 --> 45:11.692
I think puppets are a mystery.

45:17.699 --> 45:21.066
- I'm having a birthday party.
- Oh, yeah? Well, you enjoy that.

45:21.202 --> 45:22.260
There's gonna come a time

45:22.404 --> 45:24.929
when you're not gonna want people
to know it's your birthday.

45:25.073 --> 45:28.474
Why wouldn't anyone want people to know
about their birthday?

45:29.244 --> 45:31.610
Because getting old sucks.

45:31.746 --> 45:33.714
Most people don't accomplish
what they'd hoped to,

45:33.848 --> 45:36.874
and they realize
that they're most likely not going to.

45:37.018 --> 45:39.009
They end up living these quiet lives
of denial,

45:39.154 --> 45:41.315
and, you know,
brushing birthdays under the rug

45:41.456 --> 45:44.016
just becomes a big part of that.

45:46.995 --> 45:51.159
Do you ever get scared
that you could have Parkinson's disease?

45:52.400 --> 45:55.335
Not specifically Parkinson's,
but I'm not gonna lie,

45:55.470 --> 45:57.438
I've had my bouts with hypochondria.

45:58.506 --> 45:59.564
What's that?

45:59.707 --> 46:03.108
That's thinking that you have diseases
that you don't really have.

46:04.412 --> 46:07.347
Oh, my God, I have that.

46:10.452 --> 46:12.420
<i>Do you wanna tell me
about your new school?</i>

46:12.821 --> 46:14.448
Why?

46:15.490 --> 46:18.357
Because you're a kid,
there's nothing else to talk about.

46:18.493 --> 46:20.586
Well...

46:21.129 --> 46:23.927
I don't wanna talk about it.

46:26.734 --> 46:28.531
What's his name?

46:30.572 --> 46:32.062
Aaron O'Connor.

46:33.842 --> 46:35.139
Aaron O'Connor.

46:36.945 --> 46:40.381
- How'd you know?
- Because I've been there.

46:40.748 --> 46:44.479
- You went to P.S. 66?
- No, the proverbial there.

46:44.619 --> 46:47.713
You know you're gonna have to stand up
to him sooner or later, right?

46:48.156 --> 46:49.987
I don't want to.

46:50.124 --> 46:51.887
Well, then he's probably
gonna kick your ass.

46:52.026 --> 46:54.017
You all right with that?

46:54.162 --> 46:58.223
But he's bigger than me
and he knows karate.

46:58.366 --> 47:01.961
Oh, he's a karate guy.
Well, then just, uh...

47:02.103 --> 47:06.096
Tell you what.
What you do is you act crazy.

47:06.241 --> 47:08.903
- What?
- Yeah, you act crazy, all right?

47:09.043 --> 47:10.374
No one messes with the crazy guy.

47:10.512 --> 47:13.242
You just look at him
like you just don't give a fu...

47:13.915 --> 47:15.542
Funyun.

47:15.683 --> 47:19.551
- Like a don't give a Funyun?
- That's right, like you don't give a Funyun.

47:19.687 --> 47:21.678
Like you don't care
what happens to you, okay?

47:21.823 --> 47:23.415
Just like you're insane.

47:23.825 --> 47:26.453
Crazy people are wild cards,
they're very unpredictable.

47:26.594 --> 47:29.427
You never know what they're gonna do.
It makes people very scared.

47:29.564 --> 47:32.055
It scares even Aaron O' Connor.

47:32.667 --> 47:35.227
- Okay?
- Okay.

47:45.580 --> 47:46.706
He looks just like you.

47:48.049 --> 47:49.880
He's not my son.

47:52.520 --> 47:57.457
- How old is he?
- Uh, I think he's 5. Five, I think.

47:58.660 --> 48:00.218
Well...

48:00.728 --> 48:02.628
He's a little you.

48:17.345 --> 48:18.835
It's really cool.

48:20.381 --> 48:23.248
Hi. Come here.

48:24.218 --> 48:27.813
Hey. Hi.

48:27.956 --> 48:30.356
- We went to the zoo, and it was really fun.
- Really?

48:30.491 --> 48:33.892
Oh, my gosh,
that sounds like so much fun.

48:34.028 --> 48:35.586
Wally showed me the whole park.

48:36.297 --> 48:38.094
Mm.

48:38.900 --> 48:40.561
- Would you grab my bag?
- Yeah.

48:40.702 --> 48:43.728
Okay, tell me more about it.
What else did you see?

48:47.709 --> 48:49.836
So here's what we got.

48:49.978 --> 48:55.712
If you go with the cowboys again,
that means that in your dreams,

48:55.850 --> 48:58.284
you're gonna travel
to the plains of Colorado

48:58.419 --> 49:01.286
and you're gonna herd cattle.

49:01.422 --> 49:03.117
But I don't wanna kill any Indians.

49:03.458 --> 49:06.188
Well, you don't have to kill
any Indians, honey.

49:06.694 --> 49:10.630
- What about if I go with the astronauts?
- Okay.

49:10.765 --> 49:13.427
If you go with the astronauts,

49:13.568 --> 49:15.968
that means you're gonna travel
to the moon,

49:16.104 --> 49:20.302
and you'll be driving on the moon
in one of those really cool buggies

49:20.441 --> 49:22.534
that has a flag coming out of the back.

49:22.677 --> 49:24.804
I think I'll go with the astronauts.

49:24.946 --> 49:28.109
Good choice. Let's get you in bed.

49:28.249 --> 49:30.479
Oh, my Lord, to the moon we go.

49:30.618 --> 49:34.816
We're gonna have to decide who's gonna
be sleeping with Sebastian tonight.

49:34.956 --> 49:37.891
- Hmm.
- Duck or unfortunate chicken?

49:38.726 --> 49:40.626
- Dead chicken.
- Dead chicken?

49:43.464 --> 49:45.227
Oh, poor dead chicken.

49:50.204 --> 49:52.729
God, he's exhausted.

49:52.874 --> 49:54.364
What did you do to him?

49:54.509 --> 49:56.602
Did you finally get him to pass out?

49:56.744 --> 49:59.838
Yup, I did. What are you looking at?

50:00.248 --> 50:04.651
Looking at some really weird pictures
for some reason you keep.

50:04.786 --> 50:07.186
Like this one.
That was not a great choice.

50:07.321 --> 50:08.515
Are you kid...?

50:08.656 --> 50:11.523
- Fabulous choice. What do you mean?
- Not really.

50:11.659 --> 50:15.652
And how odd
that you were the only one not in costume.

50:16.364 --> 50:17.422
So not like you.

50:17.565 --> 50:19.999
If I had bunny ears like that,
I would've worn them.

50:20.968 --> 50:24.199
- That was our second date, right?
- Yes, I think you're right.

50:24.338 --> 50:28.968
And didn't you make us dance
to C+C Music Factory this whole party?

50:29.110 --> 50:31.670
- I think you did.
- I do believe I did make us do that.

50:31.813 --> 50:33.781
Yeah. They were like your favorite band
back then.

50:33.915 --> 50:37.214
- You were, like, a C+C super fan.
- That's right, I was.

50:40.254 --> 50:42.518
And you kissed me at this party, I think.

50:43.157 --> 50:47.821
I didn't kiss... I was in character.
I was a Playboy Bunny.

50:47.962 --> 50:49.520
- Please.
- Big kiss.

50:49.664 --> 50:53.395
Do you remember
that you disappeared on me that night?

50:53.735 --> 50:56.169
You were supposed to take me home.

50:58.139 --> 51:00.107
Heading for the hills
when things get too intense?

51:00.241 --> 51:01.708
That doesn't sound like me.

51:08.583 --> 51:11.950
Wasn't this the trip that I was supposed
to go on that I didn't go on?

51:12.086 --> 51:14.452
Wasn't it your third, um?

51:20.628 --> 51:24.530
Mom, I think I wanna herd cattle.

51:25.633 --> 51:26.759
Okay.

51:27.301 --> 51:28.928
I'm gonna...

51:30.204 --> 51:31.262
I'm going to...

51:31.405 --> 51:33.134
- I gotta go get into my p.j.'s too.
- Okay.

51:33.274 --> 51:34.798
I'll call you in the morning.

51:48.055 --> 51:51.923
<i>And the most inventive
are video open houses right now.</i>

52:07.341 --> 52:09.673
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Leonard, Wally here.</i>

52:09.811 --> 52:11.938
<i>Listen, I'm freaking out a little bit.</i>

52:12.079 --> 52:14.639
<i>Yeah. Yeah, no. Put it in my mouth.</i>

52:14.782 --> 52:16.977
<i>- Hello?
- Hello? Yes? Wait a second.</i>

52:17.118 --> 52:18.745
<i>Are you eating?
Want me to call you back?</i>

52:18.886 --> 52:21.684
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Tell me what you're freaking out about.

52:21.823 --> 52:26.260
Well, you know, I just...
I think that, um, I...

52:26.394 --> 52:29.989
That somehow... Hey.
Okay, stay with me here.

52:30.131 --> 52:33.032
I've been hanging out with Sebastian a lot
over the last couple of weeks,

52:33.167 --> 52:37.661
and there's these similarities
and coincidences that...

52:37.805 --> 52:40.797
I mean, I gotta run this stuff by Kassie.
She's, uh...

52:40.942 --> 52:43.809
<i>- What's the matter?
- Here comes the crazy. Somehow...</i>

52:43.945 --> 52:47.278
<i>- Yes?
- It's like this kid is mine.</i>

52:47.415 --> 52:51.579
<i>- Like he's more me than the Viking.
- The kid might be yours?</i>

52:51.719 --> 52:53.710
<i>Viking?</i>

52:53.855 --> 52:57.052
I don't know why, vaguely,
what you're saying...

52:57.191 --> 53:00.251
Hmm. Hmm.

53:00.394 --> 53:02.885
Where are you now?
Come over here, why don't you?

53:03.030 --> 53:04.190
- Hang on.
- What?

53:04.332 --> 53:07.165
- Why wouldn't you tell me that before?
- Because... Don't get mad at me.

53:07.301 --> 53:09.531
Because you never needed my help
before this.

53:09.670 --> 53:12.605
I'm giving you everything I have.
You know, this was seven years ago.

53:12.740 --> 53:14.901
You were so drunk
and you were talking gibberish,

53:15.042 --> 53:18.637
and I didn't know that, uh,
"trading Diane Sawyer to the Vikings"

53:18.779 --> 53:20.337
meant anything to anybody.

53:20.481 --> 53:24.918
- How...? What does that mean?
- What does it mean? What...?

53:25.052 --> 53:28.488
Roland is the Viking, the Viking is Roland.
Don't you see what that means?

53:28.623 --> 53:29.681
Who is Roland?

53:29.824 --> 53:31.849
Kassie's donor is Roland.
Roland's the Viking.

53:31.993 --> 53:34.018
He's the donor.
I'm sorry if I didn't tell you that.

53:34.161 --> 53:35.287
Okay, well, okay.

53:35.429 --> 53:39.331
So, what you're saying
is that, um, he is the donor,

53:39.467 --> 53:41.230
and there was a trade made.

53:41.369 --> 53:43.735
- Yup.
- Okay, uh, what kind of trade?

53:43.871 --> 53:46.203
- Who...? For who? Who?
- Oh, my God, holy shit.

53:46.340 --> 53:50.640
I mean, you don't think that I could have...?
That I?

53:50.778 --> 53:52.871
You're what? You're what?
Help me out here.

53:53.014 --> 53:59.886
That I could have traded
the Viking's ingredient for my...

54:02.490 --> 54:04.754
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

54:04.892 --> 54:08.623
Wow. How would that have even
occurred? Was there?

54:08.763 --> 54:12.062
I'm trying to picture it.
Was there access to, uh, his ingredients?

54:12.199 --> 54:13.826
- I don't even know...
- Was there access?

54:13.968 --> 54:15.833
I mean, I don't know, I...

54:18.639 --> 54:20.300
Uh-oh.

54:21.542 --> 54:24.443
Oh, jeez.
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

54:28.683 --> 54:32.517
- Yeah, I think that there was access.
- Really?

54:32.887 --> 54:36.254
- Is it starting to come back?
- Yeah, there was access. Oh, my God.

54:36.390 --> 54:40.156
- I don't like the way this is going.
- Oh, my God, I got...

54:40.294 --> 54:43.525
I think I got Sawyer in the bathroom,
I think.

54:43.664 --> 54:46.690
Because Kassie knows Diane Sawyer
and invited her somehow?

54:46.834 --> 54:49.200
Oh, my God.

54:51.439 --> 54:53.236
I switched it.

54:53.374 --> 54:57.868
I... Oh, that's... My God.
You switched? Really?

54:58.012 --> 55:00.742
I hijacked Kassie's pregnancy?

55:01.582 --> 55:05.074
Oh, that's ill-advised.

55:05.252 --> 55:08.244
How do I not remember that?

55:08.389 --> 55:12.120
Well, because you were horribly drunk,
you're a...

55:12.259 --> 55:13.886
You repress everything.

55:14.028 --> 55:16.588
You know, I've told you
about hungry dogs in the cellar.

55:16.731 --> 55:18.756
If you don't feed them,
you don't acknowledge them,

55:18.899 --> 55:21.959
at some point they're gonna get out
somehow and do something unsavory.

55:22.103 --> 55:25.368
- Exhibit A.
- My God, am I a horrible person?

55:25.506 --> 55:28.134
- No, no, no.
- Oh, Leonard, I gotta go tell her.

55:28.275 --> 55:32.109
Oh, no, no, no.
Telling Kassie? Oh, that's... Ay.

55:32.246 --> 55:34.737
Well, yes, but that's so challenging,
so delicate.

55:34.882 --> 55:36.349
It's the right thing to do, Leonard.

55:36.484 --> 55:38.884
Yeah, maybe,
but don't you wanna talk to a lawyer first?

55:39.020 --> 55:40.920
- There are...
- Huh? No, no. No lawyer.

55:41.055 --> 55:44.183
- I gotta go tell her.
- Yeah, okay, but before you go, though...

55:44.558 --> 55:48.824
- Okay.
- Um, if this is true, gee, what great news.

55:48.963 --> 55:53.161
- Congratulations, you're a father.
- That's not helpful.

56:00.074 --> 56:01.268
Hi, Wally.

56:04.812 --> 56:07.679
Hey, buddy. What are you doing awake?

56:07.815 --> 56:09.305
Insomnia.

56:10.384 --> 56:12.648
- Where's your mom?
- In her bath.

56:12.787 --> 56:15.119
Mom, Wally's here!

56:15.256 --> 56:16.951
Uh, okay.

56:18.292 --> 56:19.623
<i>You can use them any...</i>

56:19.760 --> 56:21.853
<i>- McKay...
- ... money back...</i>

56:22.329 --> 56:24.627
<i>- ... maxed out...
- ... or fun.</i>

56:24.765 --> 56:25.993
<i>- ... until we...
- ... brand-new...</i>

56:26.133 --> 56:27.464
<i>- Visit your loc...
- ... cheetahs...</i>

56:27.601 --> 56:29.296
<i>- Fight for...
- The cent...</i>

56:29.437 --> 56:31.905
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Watching TV.

56:32.039 --> 56:33.370
No, you're not, actually,

56:33.507 --> 56:35.907
you're just incessantly switching
those channels.

56:36.043 --> 56:37.806
No, I'm watching all the shows at once.

56:37.945 --> 56:39.344
<i>- Guess what.
- Three big cats.</i>

56:39.480 --> 56:40.674
- Hey, listen.
- Hey.

56:40.815 --> 56:42.442
We're gonna have to
do this better, okay?

56:42.583 --> 56:45.484
Because we're gonna be
in each other's lives for a very long time.

56:45.619 --> 56:48.645
Why are we gonna be in each other's lives
for a long time?

56:49.523 --> 56:52.515
Because, um, you know, I'm, uh...

56:52.660 --> 56:54.685
I'm your... I'm friends with your mother.

56:55.262 --> 56:58.095
Well, that doesn't mean
you're friends with me.

56:58.232 --> 56:59.460
- So give me the clicker.
- No.

56:59.600 --> 57:00.658
- No.
- Yes.

57:00.801 --> 57:01.859
- No.
- Yes.

57:02.002 --> 57:03.060
- No.
- Yes.

57:03.204 --> 57:05.035
- No, Sebastian. No.
- Yes. Yes.

57:05.172 --> 57:06.571
- Wally.
- Yes?

57:07.775 --> 57:11.006
- What are you doing?
- I need to talk to you.

57:11.612 --> 57:13.170
Okay.

57:15.082 --> 57:16.743
Outside.

57:17.551 --> 57:19.143
Outs?

57:19.820 --> 57:21.412
I'll be right outside.

57:22.356 --> 57:23.789
<i>- That is quite...
- It's that easy.</i>

57:25.426 --> 57:29.362
- All the way outside?
- I think it's better. Just... Almost there.

57:29.797 --> 57:31.287
Um...

57:31.732 --> 57:34.792
So, uh, listen, I don't know how to say this,
so I'm just...

57:34.935 --> 57:36.835
I'm gonna start, um...

57:37.404 --> 57:39.702
You're the most important person
in my life.

57:39.840 --> 57:41.364
- Yeah.
- Um...

57:42.710 --> 57:44.541
It's difficult.

57:45.479 --> 57:47.811
It's like the hardest thing
I've ever had to say to anyone,

57:47.948 --> 57:51.577
okay, because you know
that I would do anything for you, Kassie.

57:52.686 --> 57:55.814
We've known each other
for such a long time,

57:55.956 --> 57:58.083
so the last thing I wanna do
is lose you, okay,

57:58.225 --> 58:01.490
but just, some things have to be said,
you know,

58:01.629 --> 58:04.757
even if they're uncomfortable...

58:04.899 --> 58:07.390
Stop, Wally.

58:08.335 --> 58:09.893
I think I know what you're gonna say.

58:10.037 --> 58:12.835
- I don't think you know.
- Wally.

58:13.307 --> 58:15.434
Since I've been back...

58:15.576 --> 58:20.343
And we have known each other
for such a long time.

58:20.748 --> 58:23.114
Clearly, we missed each other.

58:23.250 --> 58:25.980
I would be lying if I said I didn't realize

58:26.120 --> 58:31.319
that there was a definite, you know,
energy between us.

58:31.892 --> 58:35.828
I mean, sometimes...
You know, sometimes I feel it too.

58:37.064 --> 58:38.656
- Energy?
- Yeah.

58:38.799 --> 58:42.394
I mean,
that's what you're trying to tell me.

58:43.003 --> 58:48.270
That you have feelings for me.

58:50.177 --> 58:51.735
Right?

58:52.146 --> 58:54.637
Not exactly, but...

58:59.920 --> 59:03.083
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

59:04.258 --> 59:05.782
What?

59:06.193 --> 59:08.457
I'm... You know what?

59:09.496 --> 59:14.729
I... No, no. I'm just really...
It's complicated, Wally. I'm like:

59:15.502 --> 59:18.062
Just work,
and I'm sort of in this Roland thing,

59:18.205 --> 59:19.297
so I'm not, you know...

59:19.440 --> 59:21.806
- Huh?
- I... I'm sorry. Ha, ha.

59:21.942 --> 59:23.273
- What?
- I don't... You know what?

59:23.410 --> 59:26.573
Let's just say good night.
Let's "good night" it.

59:26.714 --> 59:31.048
And, um, again, I'm sorry, and I just...
You get it.

59:31.185 --> 59:32.812
You get it.

59:32.953 --> 59:34.477
Ouch.

59:38.158 --> 59:39.716
Great.

59:41.996 --> 59:45.625
<i>- Sebastian, please open the door.
- No.</i>

59:45.766 --> 59:48.064
- Roland thing?
- Oh, such a... Not a good time.

59:48.202 --> 59:49.396
Not a good time.

59:49.837 --> 59:51.828
- Sebastian.
- What Roland thing?

59:53.707 --> 59:56.005
We've just been spending
some time together.

59:57.211 --> 59:59.771
Is it like dating?

01:00:00.281 --> 01:00:03.182
- I... Yeah, I guess. I...
- Has he met Sebastian?

01:00:03.317 --> 01:00:04.443
Shh.

01:00:04.585 --> 01:00:06.348
- Does Sebastian know...?
- No.

01:00:06.954 --> 01:00:10.287
I've set specific rules.

01:00:10.424 --> 01:00:12.392
Sebastian just doesn't like
when I'm with anybody.

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:14.050
That's why he's doing this. Sebastian.

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.326
- Where did Roland take you?
- A reading.

01:00:17.464 --> 01:00:19.364
- Like a book reading?
- Would you please?

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.627
- What was the reading about?
- It was about a kayak.

01:00:21.769 --> 01:00:22.963
- A kayak?
- Sebastian!

01:00:23.103 --> 01:00:25.264
- Sounds like a great date.
- Open this door right now.

01:00:25.406 --> 01:00:27.397
Open it yourself.

01:00:28.075 --> 01:00:31.806
- What?
- You both are driving me crazy.

01:00:37.117 --> 01:00:38.812
She's mad.

01:00:45.259 --> 01:00:47.750
She's got a boyfriend.

01:00:48.862 --> 01:00:50.955
A few dates don't make a boyfriend.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:54.056
I'm 6, by the way.

01:00:55.169 --> 01:00:58.229
- What's that?
- You told the lady on the bus I was 5.

01:00:58.372 --> 01:01:02.433
I'm not, I'm 6. My birthday's soon.

01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:08.177
Are you still going to come to my party?

01:01:13.554 --> 01:01:15.852
Yeah, Sebastian, I'm gonna be there.

01:01:27.368 --> 01:01:28.426
Are you ready?

01:01:28.569 --> 01:01:30.696
- Don't worry, I got you.
- Feels good, huh?

01:01:30.838 --> 01:01:33.466
Yeah, so go get your
sneakers on and go climb that wall.

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.040
- It should be fun.
- Hey.

01:01:35.175 --> 01:01:36.267
Let's go, sweetheart.

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:38.071
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:01:38.212 --> 01:01:39.270
- How are you?
- Good.

01:01:40.981 --> 01:01:45.145
Um, can we talk about the other night?
Uh, I haven't been able to sleep.

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:46.616
The energy thing.

01:01:46.754 --> 01:01:48.346
Wally, can we please just forget that?

01:01:48.489 --> 01:01:52.482
I definitely think it's worth talking about
because it's certainly something that...

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.059
- Hi.
- Now, that's a party.

01:01:55.596 --> 01:01:57.359
Who says a small wall
can't be invigorating?

01:01:57.498 --> 01:01:58.556
I don't know.

01:01:59.266 --> 01:02:01.131
- I was just...
- Wally, do you remember Roland?

01:02:01.502 --> 01:02:03.834
- Baba ganoush.
- Baba ganoush?

01:02:03.971 --> 01:02:06.166
You had baba ganoush
all over your shirt.

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:08.866
Kassie's party a few years back.
You were hysterical. Ha, ha.

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:12.001
Yeah. What a memory.

01:02:12.146 --> 01:02:13.636
- Thank you.
- Hey, where's Sebastian?

01:02:13.781 --> 01:02:16.579
- I wanna give him this gift.
- He's right over there.

01:02:16.717 --> 01:02:19.083
- Put it on. Seriously.
- No.

01:02:19.753 --> 01:02:21.880
- Let me take that for you.
- That's okay, I got this.

01:02:22.022 --> 01:02:24.490
No, come on,
I'll put it with the rest of the other gifts.

01:02:24.625 --> 01:02:26.217
- Okay, you got it now.
- Great.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.157
- All right, gifts ahoy.
- Roland's here.

01:02:30.297 --> 01:02:31.924
- Yeah. So...
- And in charge of the gifts.

01:02:32.065 --> 01:02:34.329
- And what have you got on today?
- What?

01:02:34.468 --> 01:02:36.060
- It's a rock-climbing outfit.
- Is it?

01:02:36.203 --> 01:02:38.467
Yeah, Roland got it for me
because it was...

01:02:38.605 --> 01:02:40.334
Listen, come on, be nice.

01:02:40.474 --> 01:02:43.170
Pretty aerodynamic.
Lot of wind up there?

01:02:43.644 --> 01:02:45.703
- Can you...? Never mind.
- Fantastic, okay.

01:02:45.846 --> 01:02:48.076
- I don't wanna climb the wall.
- What?

01:02:48.215 --> 01:02:52.675
- No, but I promise you it's gonna be fun.
- I don't think so.

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:55.345
Sebastian, the whole reason
we're having your party here

01:02:55.489 --> 01:02:57.480
is to climb the wall.

01:02:57.624 --> 01:02:59.854
We don't want the wall to go to waste,
now, do we?

01:03:00.828 --> 01:03:02.159
You feeling it?

01:03:02.296 --> 01:03:05.424
So where did Sebastian
really wanna throw his party?

01:03:05.566 --> 01:03:07.193
A kill shelter.

01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:08.926
A kill shelter?

01:03:09.069 --> 01:03:12.505
It's like a last-stop dog shelter before they,
you know.

01:03:12.639 --> 01:03:15.733
Anyway, and he thought
it would compel people to save dogs, but...

01:03:15.876 --> 01:03:17.673
- Smart.
- But this is good for him, you know?

01:03:17.811 --> 01:03:20.644
- Because it gets him active and athletic.
- It's too high! No!

01:03:20.781 --> 01:03:22.476
- I get it.
- What is he doing?

01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:26.277
- Get me down!
- Sebastian, that's too high.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.546
- Mom!
- He's up too high.

01:03:27.688 --> 01:03:29.883
Just let go of the wall, man,
the harness will hold you.

01:03:30.023 --> 01:03:31.581
Just do what he says and let go.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:35.957
- What if it breaks?
- The most important thing is to have fun.

01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:38.230
- Yes.
- I don't want to.

01:03:38.365 --> 01:03:41.664
Sebastian, you're gonna be okay, pal.
Just count to three and let go.

01:03:41.802 --> 01:03:43.167
I'm scared.

01:03:44.705 --> 01:03:46.332
I got this.

01:03:46.473 --> 01:03:48.498
I'm coming, buddy. All right.

01:03:48.642 --> 01:03:52.134
- It's not Everest, chief, relax.
- I got it, guys.

01:03:52.279 --> 01:03:53.803
- Yeah.
- Get away from me.

01:03:53.947 --> 01:03:55.005
I'm gonna get you.

01:03:55.148 --> 01:03:56.445
- No.
- I'll take you down, okay?

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:58.312
- Stop.
- I'm gonna help you.

01:03:58.452 --> 01:04:01.649
- I got him.
- Let go of me, you big monkey.

01:04:01.788 --> 01:04:03.312
Let me go.

01:04:04.658 --> 01:04:05.716
- Stop.
- Hold on.

01:04:05.859 --> 01:04:09.886
I hate that stupid wall.
And this is the worst birthday party ever.

01:04:10.998 --> 01:04:14.798
- Mommy, I don't wanna be here.
- Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

01:04:15.302 --> 01:04:16.997
You're fine.

01:04:17.137 --> 01:04:20.368
You're all right. You're okay. I'm sorry.

01:04:22.976 --> 01:04:24.466
It's okay. All right, don't worry.

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:27.011
Come on, honey, let's go...
Let's go wash you up.

01:04:32.519 --> 01:04:37.013
Boy, that was an unfortunate one for you,
but he'll be all right, you know?

01:04:37.157 --> 01:04:38.647
Yeah.

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:40.419
Yeah.

01:04:40.894 --> 01:04:42.885
Hey, I don't know you very well.

01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:45.498
What do you say we get a drink
after this?

01:04:46.767 --> 01:04:49.292
- Um...
- All right.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.534
Oh, it's just the most beautiful place
on Earth.

01:04:56.677 --> 01:04:59.976
- Have you ever been to Michigan, Wally?
- I went to Detroit for a meeting.

01:05:00.113 --> 01:05:02.138
Oh.
I'm talking about the upper peninsula.

01:05:02.282 --> 01:05:04.216
I've got a little cabin there
on Neebish Island.

01:05:04.351 --> 01:05:06.581
Been in the family for 30 years.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.019
I'm thinking of taking Kassie there.
I know it's early, but I'm really feeling it.

01:05:10.157 --> 01:05:12.591
I mean, what do you think?
You want another beer?

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.154
No, no, no, thank you.

01:05:14.294 --> 01:05:16.888
- You sure?
- Yeah, and I do have to go.

01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:21.194
Uh, you know, hey, listen,
I'm so happy, uh, that we did this.

01:05:21.335 --> 01:05:22.859
The kid hates me, Wally.

01:05:24.538 --> 01:05:29.339
No, no, no.
No, I don't think, uh, Sebastian hates you.

01:05:29.476 --> 01:05:32.070
No, no, he does.
He's told me a couple times.

01:05:32.412 --> 01:05:34.209
Oh, well, um...

01:05:34.948 --> 01:05:38.179
It's just, oh, man, he's got some, uh...

01:05:39.353 --> 01:05:41.548
- Rough edges?
- Yeah, that's it, yeah. I mean, he's...

01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:45.522
He worries a lot, he questions everything.
He's really...

01:05:45.659 --> 01:05:47.854
- Neurotic?
- Yes, that's the word.

01:05:47.995 --> 01:05:49.792
So, what's the problem?

01:05:51.031 --> 01:05:53.363
Well, I don't really relate to that.

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.831
Well...

01:05:57.738 --> 01:06:01.469
Neurotic is simply an intense form
of introspection, okay?

01:06:01.608 --> 01:06:03.439
So you're basically calling him
introspective,

01:06:03.577 --> 01:06:05.545
and being introspective is good, okay?

01:06:05.679 --> 01:06:09.137
It's walking around with an opinion,
with a point of view,

01:06:09.282 --> 01:06:12.376
- with some sort of nice kind of direction.
- Yeah, yeah. You've got it too.

01:06:12.519 --> 01:06:15.079
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, those rough edges.

01:06:15.222 --> 01:06:17.156
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it's beautiful.

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:20.659
Thanks. Hey, what's not beautiful to you?
You know?

01:06:20.794 --> 01:06:25.458
See? You did it again.
That's it, you got that focus.

01:06:25.599 --> 01:06:29.592
But that's how we're alike, Wally,
we're both determined.

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:33.763
Sebastian may be, uh,
resistant to me now, but I'll get through.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:36.967
Life throws you curveballs,
that's for sure, right?

01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:39.442
I mean, a few months ago,
I was planning on having children

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:41.809
with a woman
who I'm pretty sure I'll never see again.

01:06:42.949 --> 01:06:44.416
A few months ago?

01:06:44.551 --> 01:06:45.950
- Yep.
- That's it, huh?

01:06:46.086 --> 01:06:49.522
And now I'm crazy about a woman
who paid me for my sperm.

01:06:50.624 --> 01:06:52.285
How about that curveball?

01:06:52.726 --> 01:06:54.159
Bam!

01:06:54.828 --> 01:06:58.355
Sebastian's gonna get through this.
We're gonna lick this thing.

01:06:58.498 --> 01:07:02.696
He doesn't need to have this dark cloud
hanging over his head.

01:07:02.836 --> 01:07:04.463
What do you think,
you want another beer?

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:06.697
Oh, the guy was just...
He just would not stop.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.535
He just kept going
and talking and talking.

01:07:08.675 --> 01:07:11.803
You know, he thinks that it's his kid.
He thinks that he's my best friend.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:15.381
Wants me to give him advice on how
to be a better father to my son, you know?

01:07:15.515 --> 01:07:17.312
It's just like a nightmare.
He's e-mailing me.

01:07:17.451 --> 01:07:20.181
He's smiling at me all the time.
He's hitting me with the big teeth.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.584
- Wants me to go fly-fishing with him.
- Yeah, and why...?

01:07:22.723 --> 01:07:24.190
I don't understand. Why are we here?

01:07:24.324 --> 01:07:27.293
Because I gotta exchange this frame.
Sebastian wants one from the new line.

01:07:27.427 --> 01:07:30.555
- It's a sterling-silver 5-by-7.
- Oh, I see.

01:07:30.697 --> 01:07:33.359
Well, that's so nice that
you're taking an interest in his hobbies,

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.298
but, um, listen,
I think the first order of business

01:07:36.436 --> 01:07:38.404
is for you to take care of this thing
with Kassie.

01:07:38.538 --> 01:07:40.199
Why are we waiting? Why the wait?

01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:42.706
Please, I know that, all right?
I've been trying to do that.

01:07:42.843 --> 01:07:45.539
- But everything is all turned around now.
- Turned around?

01:07:46.346 --> 01:07:49.042
I'm turned around.

01:07:49.182 --> 01:07:52.379
That night,
she said she thought we had energy.

01:07:52.519 --> 01:07:55.579
Ooh. That's a new twist.
Never heard that before.

01:07:55.722 --> 01:07:56.780
It was very weird though.

01:07:56.923 --> 01:07:58.948
Her mouth is saying
she's spending time with Roland,

01:07:59.092 --> 01:08:00.821
but her eyes are screaming, "Save me!"

01:08:00.961 --> 01:08:03.589
Ah. So go with that. Go with the eyes.

01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:07.598
And now I think
that I have feelings for her.

01:08:08.635 --> 01:08:12.332
Really? You think so?
It's only been, uh, 13 years.

01:08:12.806 --> 01:08:15.172
Please, I know you've been saying that
for a very long time.

01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:17.776
- Now I'm finally saying it.
- Well, this is all good news.

01:08:17.911 --> 01:08:20.243
That's just... You're in love
with the mother of your child.

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:21.870
Meanwhile, she's falling for Roland.

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:24.848
And I know that I could save all of this
by just telling her the truth,

01:08:24.984 --> 01:08:27.852
but if I do that, I lose everything, right?

01:08:29.256 --> 01:08:31.156
And if you don't?

01:08:31.658 --> 01:08:34.786
Then I'll never be more
than Uncle Wally.

01:08:35.996 --> 01:08:37.122
That's no good.

01:08:37.264 --> 01:08:39.027
- Hi, excuse me.
- Yes?

01:08:39.166 --> 01:08:41.930
This is old, this is new.
I'd like this instead of this.

01:08:42.068 --> 01:08:43.126
- Yes?
- Okay.

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:54.247
Clearly, the assets in that fund were not...

01:08:55.582 --> 01:08:56.742
Hang on.

01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:59.317
I gotta take this. Sorry, hold on.

01:08:59.953 --> 01:09:01.283
<i>- Hello?
- Wally?</i>

01:09:01.421 --> 01:09:03.582
<i>- Hi.
- Oh, thank God you picked up. Okay.</i>

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:08.626
- I'm in Michigan, and, um...
- Oh, at, uh, Camp Roland, huh?

01:09:08.761 --> 01:09:12.425
Uh, yes, Wally, I'm with Roland.
He's got a cabin up here.

01:09:12.566 --> 01:09:14.363
<i>Been in the family for 30 years.</i>

01:09:14.501 --> 01:09:17.299
Yeah, yeah, it has been.
How do you know that?

01:09:17.437 --> 01:09:20.895
<i>- He told me.
- I didn't know that you guys, uh, spoke.</i>

01:09:21.041 --> 01:09:23.475
- Yeah, we're very, very close.
- Oh. Um...

01:09:25.645 --> 01:09:28.443
<i>- What was that buzzing noise?
- I have to feed the phone.</i>

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:32.143
<i>- They don't have cell service up there?
- Well, apparently not on this island.</i>

01:09:32.285 --> 01:09:36.345
So, Wally, Sebastian wanted to go
and spend the weekend with Liam.

01:09:36.488 --> 01:09:39.457
<i>And since he's been having some trouble
making friends, I let him do it.</i>

01:09:39.593 --> 01:09:44.529
But then Liam's mom called me
and told me that Sebastian has lice.

01:09:44.663 --> 01:09:47.633
<i>- Lice?
- Calm down, Wally, it's lice.</i>

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:49.200
<i>I did not say leprosy, okay?</i>

01:09:49.336 --> 01:09:53.272
Would you please not Wally this
into a situation worse than it already is?

01:09:53.406 --> 01:09:55.465
Hang on,
did you just use my name as a verb?

01:09:55.609 --> 01:09:58.442
Yeah, yeah, I did. I do that sometimes.

01:09:58.578 --> 01:10:00.978
Listen, Wally,
can you please, please help me out?

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:04.606
<i>I trust you, and you're the only person
currently in New York City</i>

01:10:04.751 --> 01:10:06.150
<i>that he can stand.</i>

01:10:06.286 --> 01:10:08.311
I've been beating myself up
about this entire thing.

01:10:08.455 --> 01:10:10.719
I have a...
I'm out the first flight tomorrow.

01:10:10.857 --> 01:10:12.791
There's no flights tonight, so I really...

01:10:12.926 --> 01:10:14.655
<i>- You know, I'm...
- Okay, all right. Enough.</i>

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.955
I pick him up,
I take him to the emergency room?

01:10:17.097 --> 01:10:19.122
You don't take him
to the emergency room. It's lice.

01:10:19.266 --> 01:10:22.758
Okay, so your place
and just plant him in front of the TV?

01:10:22.903 --> 01:10:25.098
- What do you want from me?
- Yeah, that would be great.

01:10:25.238 --> 01:10:28.401
But there's a couple more things that
you're gonna have to do before that, okay?

01:10:28.541 --> 01:10:31.203
Do you, um? Do you have a pen?

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.920
All right, don't move, I'll be right back.

01:10:52.899 --> 01:10:55.390
<i>After you've picked up
Sebastian, stop at Duane Reade.</i>

01:10:55.535 --> 01:10:56.866
<i>There's one on our corner.</i>

01:10:57.003 --> 01:11:02.464
<i>Buy a box of heavy-duty garbage bags,
shower caps, and the lice medicine.</i>

01:11:02.609 --> 01:11:04.577
<i>The doctor already called in
a prescription.</i>

01:11:04.711 --> 01:11:06.144
Here we go, Aisle 10. Where is it?

01:11:06.279 --> 01:11:08.975
There we go, there's the Tide,
where's the trash bags?

01:11:09.115 --> 01:11:11.276
- Trash bags are right there.
- There we go.

01:11:11.418 --> 01:11:13.818
Yellow drawstring. Boom.

01:11:13.954 --> 01:11:15.353
<i>When you get to my place,</i>

01:11:15.956 --> 01:11:18.948
<i>stuff all of his clothes in a trash bag
while he gets in the tub.</i>

01:11:19.092 --> 01:11:21.890
Here we go. All right, arms up, arms up.
There we go.

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:25.191
And now I'll get you to sit down over here.
We're gonna take off your pants.

01:11:25.332 --> 01:11:30.099
Okay, real good, there we go.
And now let's get in the bathroom.

01:11:31.972 --> 01:11:35.100
<i>Make sure he keeps the stuff
on his head for only ten minutes.</i>

01:11:35.241 --> 01:11:39.200
<i>And whatever you do,
don't get it in his eyes.</i>

01:11:39.346 --> 01:11:40.404
<i>And while he's doing that,</i>

01:11:40.547 --> 01:11:43.209
<i>you can strip both beds of pillowcases,
comforters and sheets.</i>

01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:46.547
All right, we just gotta get
these few little things in here, please.

01:11:46.686 --> 01:11:50.679
And let me get this.
And I'll see you in a minute, okay?

01:11:50.824 --> 01:11:53.588
<i>And then bag up all of
the throw pillows and stuffed animals.</i>

01:11:53.727 --> 01:11:58.630
<i>Make sure those bags are shut airtight
so those lice will suffocate.</i>

01:11:58.765 --> 01:12:01.461
<i>And throw everything in the wash
at the hottest temperature.</i>

01:12:01.601 --> 01:12:03.068
Pass me the detergent, please.

01:12:03.203 --> 01:12:05.763
<i>This is not
enough steps. Can we add some more?</i>

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:08.032
<i>Please just let me shave his head
and be done with it.</i>

01:12:08.174 --> 01:12:09.971
<i>- Wally.
- Okay, okay.</i>

01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:14.774
<i>But whatever you do, Wally,
try not to make a big deal out of it.</i>

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:18.012
<i>And make sure to follow the instructions
and wash his hair.</i>

01:12:21.955 --> 01:12:25.482
Everything okay? You all right?
Are you doing okay?

01:12:27.427 --> 01:12:30.988
<i>Oh, and just one more thing,
and it's sort of the worst part.</i>

01:12:33.166 --> 01:12:35.430
<i>There's this little comb.</i>

01:12:35.568 --> 01:12:38.969
Oh, my God, this cannot be happening.

01:12:39.606 --> 01:12:40.664
- What?
- No, no, no.

01:12:40.807 --> 01:12:44.766
Just keep looking that way, pal.
Nothing's going on. Everything's good.

01:12:48.648 --> 01:12:52.345
Are they everywhere?
Are they climbing all over my head?

01:12:52.485 --> 01:12:53.850
Huh? No, they're fine.

01:12:53.987 --> 01:12:57.286
They're absolute... You're fine.
Everything's okay.

01:12:57.424 --> 01:12:58.550
Are you gonna throw up?

01:12:58.691 --> 01:13:01.387
No, I'm not gonna throw up.
I'm busy killing lice.

01:13:01.995 --> 01:13:05.795
- Did you find some?
- I think so.

01:13:06.366 --> 01:13:08.095
I got them.

01:13:13.273 --> 01:13:16.367
All right, hot out of the dryer.

01:13:16.509 --> 01:13:20.377
I think we are now officially deliced.

01:13:20.513 --> 01:13:23.346
Or "-loused," right? "Deloused"?

01:13:23.483 --> 01:13:26.213
Whatever it is,
we're down to DEFCON 1.

01:13:26.586 --> 01:13:30.488
Or is it 5?
Can never figure out which way that goes.

01:13:30.623 --> 01:13:32.181
All right, good night.

01:13:34.694 --> 01:13:37.185
Sweet dreams, okay?

01:13:38.798 --> 01:13:40.823
This is your collection, right? Huh?

01:13:44.971 --> 01:13:47.872
Why don't you wanna use any
of these frames?

01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:51.237
Why does everyone ask me that?

01:13:52.879 --> 01:13:55.814
Because, you know,
people like to put their own pictures

01:13:55.949 --> 01:13:57.780
inside their frames.

01:13:59.319 --> 01:14:01.514
But they already have pictures in them.

01:14:01.654 --> 01:14:03.679
That's true,
but you don't know any of these people.

01:14:03.823 --> 01:14:05.256
Sure I do.

01:14:05.758 --> 01:14:10.752
See, like these people.
This is the Owen family.

01:14:10.897 --> 01:14:15.197
That's Mr. and Mrs. Owen,
and those are their two kids.

01:14:16.136 --> 01:14:18.468
He studies volcanoes,

01:14:18.605 --> 01:14:25.534
and Mrs. Owen used to work for a place
that sells heart medicines for pets.

01:14:26.246 --> 01:14:27.804
Mm-hm.

01:14:28.248 --> 01:14:30.375
Well, that's funny,
because Mr. and Mrs. Owen

01:14:30.517 --> 01:14:32.917
look like third-rate
stock-photography models to me.

01:14:34.687 --> 01:14:36.211
That's my grandfather.

01:14:39.692 --> 01:14:41.592
- Which one, right here?
- Yeah.

01:14:41.728 --> 01:14:43.457
This guy?

01:14:44.864 --> 01:14:46.832
He's my father's dad.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.261
He owns a boat.

01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:53.395
He takes it out every day
to go fishing for sharks.

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:56.201
And he knows a lot.

01:14:58.545 --> 01:15:01.776
Did you know
that sharks don't have bones?

01:15:01.915 --> 01:15:04.349
No, but I do now.

01:15:06.286 --> 01:15:07.981
That's my Uncle Rick.

01:15:08.655 --> 01:15:10.987
He's my father's younger brother.

01:15:11.124 --> 01:15:13.854
- This guy here?
- Yeah.

01:15:15.828 --> 01:15:18.956
He got me an iPod for my birthday.

01:15:19.465 --> 01:15:25.233
But I think he stole it from somebody
because it already had music on it.

01:15:29.309 --> 01:15:31.539
What's your dad's family like?

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:35.346
I don't know. I never met them.

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:37.446
Why not?

01:15:38.618 --> 01:15:40.916
My father left when I was...

01:15:41.087 --> 01:15:43.487
When I was pretty young.

01:16:12.552 --> 01:16:14.747
You can keep it.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.331
Sweet dreams.

01:16:38.111 --> 01:16:40.306
See, now, I think you put
too much flour in that, right?

01:16:40.446 --> 01:16:43.347
What you've got there is like a...
It's more like a paste, right?

01:16:43.483 --> 01:16:45.348
I mean, we could spackle these walls
with that.

01:16:45.485 --> 01:16:47.749
I think you need to put
a little bit more water in that.

01:16:47.887 --> 01:16:48.945
- All right?
- Okay.

01:16:49.088 --> 01:16:50.953
Let's think of something else
for the pancakes.

01:16:52.292 --> 01:16:53.589
What about, um, chocolate chips?

01:16:53.726 --> 01:16:56.490
Your mom got any of those?
Or what about peanut butter?

01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:57.994
- Maybe.
- Or cheese.

01:16:58.131 --> 01:16:59.826
Let's go the other way with it, right?

01:16:59.966 --> 01:17:02.264
Let's make it a little bit more
of a lunch pancake, right?

01:17:02.402 --> 01:17:05.769
- Why not? You like cheese?
- Let's put lice in the batter.

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:09.800
What is so funny to you
about the concept of eating your lice?

01:17:09.942 --> 01:17:12.740
- I don't know, it's just funny.
- Are you looking for texture?

01:17:12.879 --> 01:17:15.848
If we burn them, you get a little crunch.
Keep your lice out of it.

01:17:15.982 --> 01:17:17.882
- Hi, hey.
- Hello.

01:17:18.017 --> 01:17:21.714
- Mommy, I wanna show you the dead lice.
- Come here, let me see that.

01:17:22.121 --> 01:17:23.554
- Come here.
- You're home.

01:17:23.690 --> 01:17:25.453
What do you have in that jar? Lice?

01:17:25.591 --> 01:17:26.785
- Lice.
- Are you kidding me?

01:17:26.926 --> 01:17:30.828
- Wally hunted them and killed them all.
- Let me see. I'm so sorry I wasn't here.

01:17:30.963 --> 01:17:33.295
- Is it all out?
- Yeah.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:34.858
- Oh, I love you.
- Me too.

01:17:35.001 --> 01:17:37.526
I'm gonna take the dead lice
to watch TV.

01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:38.830
That's a cute look.

01:17:39.672 --> 01:17:41.731
Oh, this is, um...

01:17:42.308 --> 01:17:45.004
I was starting to feel itchy,
so I used a little bit of the shampoo.

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:47.003
You don't have lice.

01:17:47.747 --> 01:17:51.683
- Uh, I could. I could actually have lice.
- You don't have lice.

01:17:51.818 --> 01:17:55.584
And I really thank you.
I appreciate you taking care of all this.

01:17:55.722 --> 01:17:58.122
- Thanks for taking care of him.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

01:17:58.257 --> 01:18:00.817
- How was that weekend?
- It was good.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:05.090
It was good. It was really beautiful.
It's quiet, it's on the lake and...

01:18:05.231 --> 01:18:07.665
You know,
his grandfather actually built the cabin

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.893
from logs that they milled
on the property, and so...

01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:17.000
And we're gonna go, I think,
in like two weeks, take Sebastian.

01:18:18.911 --> 01:18:20.606
Really? That's...

01:18:20.747 --> 01:18:22.840
- It's getting serious, huh?
- Yeah.

01:18:24.117 --> 01:18:28.781
We're actually, um,
thinking about moving in together.

01:18:31.524 --> 01:18:33.515
That's...

01:18:33.659 --> 01:18:36.287
I mean, you know, Kassie, I...

01:18:36.429 --> 01:18:38.863
- That's a mistake. I think that this guy...
- No, don't.

01:18:38.998 --> 01:18:40.465
...is a mistake.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.500
Don't do this. Don't ruin this for me.

01:18:42.635 --> 01:18:43.829
- Hang on.
- No.

01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:45.494
Kassie.

01:18:46.038 --> 01:18:48.905
Come on, look, he started the year
married to someone else.

01:18:49.041 --> 01:18:51.441
Look, he's obviously going
through some kind of crap,

01:18:51.577 --> 01:18:52.874
and maybe he doesn't realize it,

01:18:53.012 --> 01:18:56.140
but it looks like he might be using you
and Sebastian to cushion the blow.

01:18:56.282 --> 01:19:00.742
You know that I actually thought
for a brief second that you changed?

01:19:00.887 --> 01:19:02.115
But you haven't.

01:19:02.255 --> 01:19:06.021
I'm trying to move forward with my life,
and you are exactly the same.

01:19:06.159 --> 01:19:08.559
The truth is, I'm actually happy.

01:19:08.694 --> 01:19:11.492
- Are you?
- Yes.

01:19:12.198 --> 01:19:16.999
Roland is a really good guy, all right?
He's supp... You know what?

01:19:17.136 --> 01:19:19.434
Just because you've never taken a risk
in your entire life

01:19:19.572 --> 01:19:21.233
doesn't mean
you have to rip apart mine.

01:19:22.341 --> 01:19:25.367
At least I'm trying to let somebody in.

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:27.536
You should try it sometime.

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:32.982
I mean, unless you have something else
that you would like to say to me.

01:19:34.587 --> 01:19:35.849
Wally?

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:39.624
Really? Got nothing for me, huh?

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:45.028
- Nothing?
- Ooh. Do I smell flapjacks?

01:19:45.164 --> 01:19:49.032
Hey, Wally,
thanks for being on lice patrol, man.

01:19:49.168 --> 01:19:52.035
You gotta try some of this beer
Grandma made.

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:08.512
Sebastian, what's going on?
What happened?

01:21:08.648 --> 01:21:12.175
I was at Ethan's birthday party
and I did what you told me to.

01:21:12.685 --> 01:21:14.949
Aaron O'Connor was there.

01:21:15.087 --> 01:21:17.612
I stood up to him and acted crazy.

01:21:22.828 --> 01:21:24.762
Look at your face.

01:21:24.897 --> 01:21:27.365
He punched me
and then threw me into a puddle

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.229
and then hit me again.

01:21:29.368 --> 01:21:30.926
Come here.

01:21:31.904 --> 01:21:35.396
- He didn't care that I was crazy.
- Shh. It's okay.

01:21:35.541 --> 01:21:38.510
It didn't work, I tried.

01:21:39.111 --> 01:21:41.204
Where was this? Where was the party?

01:21:41.347 --> 01:21:44.316
- At the park.
- Which park?

01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:48.386
- East End.
- East End Park?

01:21:48.521 --> 01:21:51.046
That's like 20 blocks away from here.

01:21:52.058 --> 01:21:54.026
Um, I'm gonna call your mom
to come get you.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.993
No, Wally, you have to take me home.

01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:02.600
Take me home, Wally.

01:22:04.337 --> 01:22:06.862
Sebastian, why did you come here?

01:22:08.307 --> 01:22:11.504
Because I thought you'd be proud of me.

01:22:19.318 --> 01:22:22.412
Oh, my God, honey,
what happened to you?

01:22:22.555 --> 01:22:25.752
- I got into a fight.
- Sweetie, oh, my God.

01:22:25.891 --> 01:22:28.086
- Why didn't Donna call me?
- It's actually my fault.

01:22:28.227 --> 01:22:31.890
I told him to do something really stupid
a while back, and he listened to me.

01:22:32.031 --> 01:22:34.966
But he's fine.
He came over to my place and...

01:22:35.101 --> 01:22:37.296
He came to you?

01:22:38.004 --> 01:22:40.131
- Yeah, and...
- I thought I heard the doorbell.

01:22:40.272 --> 01:22:43.605
- Oh, what's going on?
- Oh, Roland's family is in town.

01:22:43.743 --> 01:22:45.108
We're just having a little brunch.

01:22:45.244 --> 01:22:46.973
- Hey, Wally.
- Who beat the kid?

01:22:48.014 --> 01:22:50.346
- Come on, let's go.
- Sweetie, come here.

01:22:50.483 --> 01:22:52.451
Oh, my God, you're covered in dirt.

01:22:52.585 --> 01:22:54.678
Come on, honey,
let's go get cleaned up.

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.811
We'll fix you up.

01:22:58.557 --> 01:23:00.422
Let's go in the kitchen.

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:02.754
Somebody punched you?

01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:04.385
- Hey, Wally.
- Yeah?

01:23:04.530 --> 01:23:05.588
What happened?

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:07.995
- He got in a fight with another kid.
- Oh, that's awful.

01:23:08.134 --> 01:23:10.364
- Yeah.
- You know, but it'll make him stronger.

01:23:10.503 --> 01:23:14.530
I took a few lumps when I was a kid,
usually at the hands of my older brothers.

01:23:14.674 --> 01:23:16.665
- Who are here. You gotta meet them.
- Okay.

01:23:16.809 --> 01:23:18.868
Oh, wait, hold on.

01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:23.109
Check it out.

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:25.216
Right?

01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:30.518
Stick around. It's gonna get good.

01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:35.925
I'm sorry, Roland.

01:23:39.231 --> 01:23:40.994
For what?

01:23:41.133 --> 01:23:43.033
- Doesn't feel that bad, huh?
- No.

01:23:43.169 --> 01:23:44.397
- Hey.
- Not really?

01:23:44.537 --> 01:23:46.801
- I'm okay.
- I really do need to talk to you.

01:23:47.406 --> 01:23:48.600
Act crazy, Wally?

01:23:48.741 --> 01:23:51.539
Remind me to never to ask you for advice
when I'm being bullied.

01:23:51.677 --> 01:23:54.612
What do you want from me, Debbie?
I'm an idiot. Kassie, this cannot wait.

01:23:55.681 --> 01:23:57.205
- Debbie...?
- I got it, and I'm sorry.

01:23:57.349 --> 01:23:58.407
I will be right back.

01:23:58.551 --> 01:24:01.111
- It was just talk.
- Thanks.

01:24:05.057 --> 01:24:07.321
What got into him?

01:24:08.027 --> 01:24:10.188
You wanna try these peas?

01:24:10.596 --> 01:24:12.962
All right, Wally, what is it?

01:24:13.099 --> 01:24:14.623
I, uh...

01:24:14.767 --> 01:24:18.168
There she is.
Hey, Kass, Wally, come on in.

01:24:18.304 --> 01:24:20.295
Yeah, come on in, take a seat.

01:24:20.439 --> 01:24:21.997
- Listen, hang on one second.
- I can't.

01:24:22.141 --> 01:24:25.508
Kass, come on in. You too, Wally.

01:24:25.644 --> 01:24:27.839
- Okay.
- Come on, take a seat.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.140
Everybody listen up.

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:30.706
Hush, hush.

01:24:32.752 --> 01:24:34.379
Got a little something to say. Everybody.

01:24:35.988 --> 01:24:37.046
All right.

01:24:38.724 --> 01:24:40.783
A few months ago,

01:24:41.293 --> 01:24:44.854
and I'm not gonna lie,
I was, uh, in a dark place.

01:24:45.731 --> 01:24:48.666
- Um, I was in a world of pain.
- Kassie. Kassie.

01:24:48.801 --> 01:24:50.428
I really have to talk to you.

01:24:50.569 --> 01:24:52.298
- My wife, ex-wife...
- Stop.

01:24:52.438 --> 01:24:57.239
- had left me for reasons
that I don't need to get into now.

01:24:57.376 --> 01:24:59.503
Over here, right now.

01:24:59.645 --> 01:25:01.909
- And then...
- It's gotta be now. Trust me this is real.

01:25:02.047 --> 01:25:03.514
...one day...
- Cut it out.

01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:04.741
...the heavens opened,

01:25:06.051 --> 01:25:10.920
and the sweet voice of an angel
is on my phone machine.

01:25:12.758 --> 01:25:17.092
And I am happy to say
to you all that I love,

01:25:17.563 --> 01:25:20.896
that my life is whole again.

01:25:21.033 --> 01:25:23.263
Today Sebastian
scared the hell out of me.

01:25:23.402 --> 01:25:25.563
Wally, take a seat,
I'm about to get to the good stuff.

01:25:25.704 --> 01:25:28.502
Roland, I'm sorry, you're a really good guy.
I hate to do this to you.

01:25:28.641 --> 01:25:30.734
- Hate to do what?
- Throw this curveball.

01:25:31.477 --> 01:25:35.538
When Sebastian needed someone today,
Kassie, he came to me.

01:25:35.681 --> 01:25:40.084
You know, he needed me.
And I need him.

01:25:40.653 --> 01:25:42.416
All right,
what are you talking about, Wally?

01:25:42.555 --> 01:25:45.353
I'm talking about something
I haven't been able to say before, Kassie.

01:25:45.491 --> 01:25:47.083
I, uh...

01:25:48.594 --> 01:25:54.191
I hijacked your pregnancy.

01:25:55.267 --> 01:25:57.326
I'm the seed guy.

01:26:03.642 --> 01:26:04.973
What?

01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:11.674
I replaced, uh, Roland's offering
with mine that night,

01:26:11.817 --> 01:26:13.011
your party.

01:26:13.152 --> 01:26:14.779
Um...

01:26:17.223 --> 01:26:19.851
Sebastian's my son.

01:26:20.693 --> 01:26:25.756
I know it was a reckless and careless
and terrible thing to do,

01:26:25.898 --> 01:26:27.388
but, I mean, I panicked, you know.

01:26:27.533 --> 01:26:30.058
I'm not like you, you know.

01:26:30.202 --> 01:26:33.228
You're not afraid of anything.
I'm afraid of everything.

01:26:33.372 --> 01:26:35.237
I can't even take risks, you know,
you said it.

01:26:35.374 --> 01:26:37.934
But nothing scares you, Kassie,
and I love that about you.

01:26:39.545 --> 01:26:42.343
I mean, you're gonna hate me
the rest of your life,

01:26:42.481 --> 01:26:45.314
and you're never gonna forgive me,
and I don't expect you to forgive me.

01:26:45.451 --> 01:26:48.978
It just... It breaks my heart, it kills me,

01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:52.557
because he's changed me.

01:26:52.892 --> 01:26:56.293
You've changed me, and, um...

01:26:59.598 --> 01:27:01.190
...I love you.

01:27:09.275 --> 01:27:12.733
I couldn't say that before,
but I'm saying it right now.

01:27:18.384 --> 01:27:21.046
And I'm also saying I'm sorry.

01:27:21.186 --> 01:27:23.484
I'm really sorry.

01:27:30.129 --> 01:27:32.063
Good we got that dirt off.

01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:37.935
Don't ever speak to us again.

01:27:45.611 --> 01:27:47.010
What did I miss?

01:27:55.287 --> 01:27:57.983
Sorry about your proposal, Roland.

01:27:58.123 --> 01:28:00.057
His what?

01:28:01.593 --> 01:28:03.618
Oh, my God.

01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:16.833
I am proud of you.

01:28:56.882 --> 01:29:01.080
- Wally, it's 4 a.m.
- I did it.

01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:03.279
I did the right thing, Leonard.

01:29:03.756 --> 01:29:06.884
- Come on in.
- I faced my fear, I told her.

01:29:07.026 --> 01:29:10.587
That's good, Wally. That's real good.

01:29:10.729 --> 01:29:14.563
But I lost her. And Sebastian.

01:29:16.468 --> 01:29:18.834
You did the right thing.
I'm proud of you, Wally.

01:29:19.605 --> 01:29:22.267
- It sucks.
- But it'll get better.

01:29:22.408 --> 01:29:26.811
You know,
I'm drinking booze from a deli.

01:29:29.748 --> 01:29:31.943
You should go home, Wally.

01:29:34.586 --> 01:29:36.850
They are my home, Leonard.

01:31:21.293 --> 01:31:25.753
So I've thought about it, and, uh,

01:31:25.898 --> 01:31:30.096
you can't just disappear
from Sebastian's life.

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:31.998
So...

01:31:32.137 --> 01:31:33.399
You know, he's your son.

01:31:35.807 --> 01:31:39.470
And of course you can see him.

01:31:39.611 --> 01:31:41.806
But it's gonna be on my terms.

01:31:46.018 --> 01:31:47.781
How's he doing?

01:31:49.154 --> 01:31:50.314
He misses you.

01:31:50.923 --> 01:31:54.154
- I miss him.
- A lot.

01:31:54.293 --> 01:31:57.490
Is he...?
How's he getting along with Roland, okay?

01:31:58.197 --> 01:31:59.789
Yeah.

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:02.566
I, uh...

01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:05.630
I couldn't go through with that.

01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:11.174
- What happened? What do you mean?
- I don't know.

01:32:14.246 --> 01:32:16.305
He's affectionate.

01:32:17.015 --> 01:32:18.983
Likes me to try new things.

01:32:19.818 --> 01:32:22.412
He doesn't turn into a psycho
when he drinks.

01:32:22.554 --> 01:32:25.853
He doesn't moan when he eats.

01:32:28.794 --> 01:32:31.558
I turned him down because he's not you.

01:32:48.847 --> 01:32:50.075
Will you marry me?

01:32:52.251 --> 01:32:54.219
Probably.

01:33:17.209 --> 01:33:18.972
<i>Look at us.</i>

01:33:20.279 --> 01:33:21.940
<i>Running around,</i>

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:26.107
<i>always rushed, always late.</i>

01:33:26.885 --> 01:33:29.615
<i>Guess that's why they call it
the human race.</i>

01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:37.751
<i>But sometimes it slows down just enough
for all the pieces to fall into place.</i>

01:33:40.165 --> 01:33:42.759
<i>Fate works its magic.</i>

01:33:45.203 --> 01:33:47.137
<i>And you're connected.</i>

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:51.040
- Oh. Hi.
- You smell that?

01:33:51.176 --> 01:33:53.542
- What is that?
- That's charcoal, lighter fluid,

01:33:53.679 --> 01:33:54.907
and my burnt arm hairs.

01:33:55.047 --> 01:33:56.708
- Is that working for you at all?
- Oh.

01:33:58.417 --> 01:34:00.442
Shame there are all these children
around.

01:34:00.585 --> 01:34:01.643
I don't mind an audience.

01:34:01.787 --> 01:34:03.311
- You don't?
- No, they'll seem like my team.

01:34:03.455 --> 01:34:07.357
Oh, God, no. Honey, here, ice cream.
Take this out there, but be careful.

01:34:07.492 --> 01:34:10.552
One of these children has a milk allergy,
and I have no clue which one it is.

01:34:10.696 --> 01:34:12.254
It might be the little blond one there.

01:34:12.397 --> 01:34:14.092
- Just go with a sorbet or something?
- No.

01:34:14.232 --> 01:34:15.927
- You sure?
- No, no.

01:34:47.499 --> 01:34:48.966
- Yeah, Sebastian!
- Whoo!

01:34:49.101 --> 01:34:51.296
Yeah, Sebastian!

01:34:51.970 --> 01:34:53.699
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:53.839 --> 01:34:55.966
- Nice.
- How about that?

01:34:56.108 --> 01:35:01.307
Now, this year, Sebastian has decided
to dedicate his birthday to Doug.

01:35:01.446 --> 01:35:02.504
And Doug is a...

01:35:02.647 --> 01:35:07.584
He's just a wonderful, uh, playful,
three-legged dog,

01:35:07.719 --> 01:35:11.553
and, um, he's in need of a home, so...

01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:13.617
And?

01:35:15.227 --> 01:35:18.685
And, um, well, Doug is, uh...

01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:22.357
He's next in line at the kill shelter
to be put down.

01:35:22.501 --> 01:35:25.026
Oh, that would be a horrible way to go.

01:35:25.437 --> 01:35:28.497
- But not dead yet. Very much alive.
- That's so good. Positive thinking.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:29.902
- Happy puppy.
- And, yeah.

01:35:30.041 --> 01:35:33.010
Let's go ahead and blow out the candles.
Get some of that cake in our face.

01:35:33.145 --> 01:35:36.706
I'm not blowing out anything
until someone takes Doug.

01:35:38.016 --> 01:35:39.779
Okay.

01:35:39.918 --> 01:35:41.613
Well, I'll take him.

01:35:41.753 --> 01:35:43.345
- Debbie Epstein.
- Thank you.

01:35:43.488 --> 01:35:44.546
Debbie Epstein.

01:35:45.023 --> 01:35:48.220
I can handle him.
He's only got three legs. That's...

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:49.884
All right.

01:35:50.429 --> 01:35:54.490
- Surprising.
- Okay, make a wish, baby. Come on.

01:35:55.167 --> 01:35:56.566
- Harder.
- There you go.

01:35:56.701 --> 01:35:57.929
Really well done. One more.

01:35:58.069 --> 01:35:59.468
- Here I come.
- Yes.

01:36:00.806 --> 01:36:03.001
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Sebastian.

01:36:03.141 --> 01:36:04.904
I love you, baby, sweet cheeks.

01:36:05.043 --> 01:36:08.570
<i>Every once in a while,
amid all the randomness,</i>

01:36:09.147 --> 01:36:13.641
<i>something unexpected happens,
and it pushes us all forward.</i>

01:36:13.985 --> 01:36:18.479
<i>And the truth is,
what I'm starting to think,</i>

01:36:18.623 --> 01:36:21.251
<i>what I'm starting to feel,</i>

01:36:23.462 --> 01:36:27.057
<i>is that maybe the human race</i>

01:36:28.266 --> 01:36:31.099
<i>isn't a race at all.</i>
