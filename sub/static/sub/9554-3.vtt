Hi, Chachi. This is Al.

01:20.481 --> 01:23.542
Yeah, I just got a card
from the gang in Hollywood.

01:23.651 --> 01:26.814
Not from your cousin Fonzie.
This is from Richie.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.321
Listen, it says, "Dear Al,

01:29.423 --> 01:32.859
"Life is funny. Ha, ha, ha.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.952

02:24.745 --> 02:26.975
Oh. This is great.

02:27.081 --> 02:29.243
It's like From Here to Eternity.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.249
We're Burt Lancaster
and Deborah Kerr.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.251
Well, which one am I?

02:33.353 --> 02:36.254
Pretty and
a sense of humor, too.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.347
Oh, let's go!

02:40.761 --> 02:42.729
You know, life is funny.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.389
H ow?

02:44.498 --> 02:47.593
Well...
only a few short days ago,

02:47.701 --> 02:50.534
I was a high school graduate
from Milwaukee,

02:50.637 --> 02:52.662
just a very normal guy.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.605
Now I'm in Hollywood.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.540
I'm gonna be a movie star.

02:56.643 --> 02:58.668
I met a terrific girl.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.009
Oh, yes,
and I met a terrific guy.

03:01.115 --> 03:03.743
Maybe we'll run into each other
again someday.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.377
I really hope so.

03:08.555 --> 03:10.785
Wait a minute.
What-what is this, uh,

03:10.891 --> 03:12.518
"again someday" stuff?

03:12.626 --> 03:17.359
Richie, I meant to tell you
earlier, but I didn't know how.

03:17.464 --> 03:19.330
But now I've got to.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.595
Y-You're engaged.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.931
You're married.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.504
Oh, it-it's freckles.

03:24.605 --> 03:25.936
- That's it. You hate freckles.
- No, no. It's not that.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.474
- I hate my freckles. -I like
your freckles. And I like you.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.067
But this is my field term.

03:31.178 --> 03:34.876
My oceanography class goes on a
cruise for practical experience.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.680
Oh.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.344
Well, good.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.820
So I'll see you
when you get back.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.890
- Where you 910N197
- Pago Page.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.925
Great. Great.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.824
Gee, I knew you'd understand.

03:47.928 --> 03:52.331
Oh, me? I'm, uh...
Mr. Understanding.

03:52.432 --> 03:54.662
And I'm just glad
it wasn't my freckles.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.759
No, it wasn't your freckles.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.364
Wait! Well...

03:59.473 --> 04:01.373
do you have to leave already?
I mean,

04:01.475 --> 04:03.739
d-don't you have to wait
for the tide to go out

04:03.844 --> 04:05.334
-or some oceanography thing?
- Richie, no, we...

04:05.445 --> 04:06.935
we cast off early tomorrow
morning.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.141
I've got to go pack.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.751
Listen...

04:12.853 --> 04:14.582
good luck with everything.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.678
I'll write.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.733
Bye.

04:31.839 --> 04:34.433
Thanks.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.974
Life is funny.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.210
Not as funny
as it was a minute ago.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.305
POTSIE:
Hey, Rich!

04:44.218 --> 04:45.982
- Rich! Rich!
- Come quick!

04:46.086 --> 04:47.986
- What? ls there something wrong?
- It's a shark!

04:48.088 --> 04:50.056
- The Fonz...
- Fonz got eaten by a shark?!

04:50.157 --> 04:51.852
- He did? Who said that?
- Not me.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.051
What are you
talking about, Rich?

04:53.160 --> 04:54.855
- Well, you just said a shark.
- No, listen.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.930
Fonz is gonna jump over a shark.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.361
Snap out of it, Rich.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.058
Fonz is gonna jump over a shark.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.328
I don't get it.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.062
Okay, Rich, read my lips:

05:03.170 --> 05:05.070
Fonzie wants you.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.072
The California Kid
challenged him,

05:07.174 --> 05:09.268
and they're gonna jump
over a shark net.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.811
You get to drive Fonzie.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.574
Shark?! Is he crazy?!

05:17.551 --> 05:20.384
A shark? That is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.922
Stupid, yes. Also dumb.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.354
But it's something I gotta do.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.257
Fonz, y-you're not jumping
over garbage cans on a bike.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.193
You're jumping over a shark.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.390
On nothing. On a couple
of little skis.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.263
One little slip
and chomp, chomp, chomp.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.268
Thanks a lot for your support.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.429
Look, I was challenged.

05:38.538 --> 05:39.630
I gotta jump-.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.299
Challenged?!
The guy's bluffing.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.308
He's not gonna jump
over some shark.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.900
That's right.
He was bluffing. Huh?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.241
All right,
let me tell you something,

05:46.346 --> 05:47.575
that's another reason
I got to jump.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.911
'Cause that punk is trying
to take a free ride.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.451
Look, you already tied him

05:51.551 --> 05:53.383
and-and his championship
patches.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.717
So why can't you just drop it?

05:55.822 --> 05:57.722
I have to meet his bluff.

05:57.824 --> 06:01.385
I ain't going back to Milwaukee
a double failure.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.486
Now, are you coming?

06:04.498 --> 06:06.933
Let's go.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.194
Girls.

06:11.305 --> 06:13.865
So, Prince Valiant,
are you ready?

06:13.974 --> 06:16.671
(chuckles)
Are you actually gonna do it?

06:16.777 --> 06:19.041
- Yeah. Are you?
- Yeah.

06:19.146 --> 06:22.912
Well, look, since you had
a condition on this tiebreaker,

06:23.016 --> 06:24.780
I got one, too.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.250
Go ahead.

06:26.353 --> 06:29.050
You go first.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.715
That way,
when you jump and fall,

06:30.824 --> 06:33.384
that little shark ain't gonna be
so hungry when I go.

06:33.493 --> 06:34.517
(girls laugh)

06:34.628 --> 06:37.529
Well, I...

06:37.631 --> 06:39.861
(clucking like a chicken)

06:39.967 --> 06:42.197
-(laughter)
- Yeah, all right!

06:42.302 --> 06:43.792
Wait a minute, kid,
you know, he's...

06:43.904 --> 06:44.996
Shut up!

06:45.105 --> 06:46.937
Fire up the boat.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.337
I'm jumping the shark.

06:48.442 --> 06:51.173
Gosh, I'm always
firing up a boat.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.269
(indistinct chatter, cooing)

07:07.027 --> 07:08.586
Oh, I can't watch.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.254
What if he doesn't make it?

07:10.364 --> 07:13.527
Relax. How much can one shark
eat anyway, huh?

07:13.633 --> 07:16.864
I'm kidding. I'm nervous, too.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.337
Oh, Mom, Dad, over here!

07:21.908 --> 07:23.740
Where have you guys been?

07:23.844 --> 07:25.141
There, now, you see?

07:25.245 --> 07:27.077
You and your
"just one more ashtray, Howard."

07:27.180 --> 07:28.341
Now we missed the race.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.542
But we may never get
to Hollywood again.

07:30.650 --> 07:33.051
We won't have to. We're gonna
have half of it in Milwaukee.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.383
Oh, sit on it, Howard.

07:35.489 --> 07:38.220
Forget the souvenirs.
You've got to stop Fonzie.

07:38.325 --> 07:39.759
I thought the race was over.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.055
No, it was a tie.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.390
Well, what's all the excitement?

07:42.496 --> 07:45.227
The Fonz and the California Kid
are gonna break the tie.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.300
They're gonna jump over a shark!

07:47.401 --> 07:50.462
- Isn't that dangerous?
- Well, of course it's dangerous.

07:50.570 --> 07:51.594
Well, you should stop them.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.104
- We've got to do something.
- Yeah!

07:53.206 --> 07:55.573
Well, what would you like me
to do, talk to the shark?

07:55.675 --> 07:56.665
Oh, Howard, would you?

07:56.777 --> 07:59.144
No, Marion, I wouldn't.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.421
This is ridiculous.

08:24.271 --> 08:27.036
(indistinct chatter)

08:59.940 --> 09:01.465
The California Kid quit!

09:01.575 --> 09:03.009
-(all shouting)
- ALL: Chicken!

09:03.110 --> 09:05.511
Good! Now Fonzie doesn't have
to do the jump.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.706
- Boy, that was close.
- You did it, Fonz.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.373
- Winner and still champion.
- Yeah.

09:09.483 --> 09:10.382
All right, it's my turn.

09:10.484 --> 09:11.974
Come on, row me
out to the ski boat.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.211
Get in the boat?!

09:13.320 --> 09:15.049
Fonz, you don't have
to jump now.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.645
The California Kid quit.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.315
The Fonz don't quit.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.587
Are you gonna drive
for me or not?

09:21.962 --> 09:23.191
No.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.593
Malph, get in the boat
and drive.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.029
All right, Fonz.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.328
You won't be sorry.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.765
This time I'll remember
to untie it.

09:28.869 --> 09:29.768
All right! Okay!

09:29.870 --> 09:31.565
I'm gonna drive.

09:31.671 --> 09:34.606
What is this,
more of the Fonzarelli Code?

09:34.708 --> 09:36.005
You don't understand,
Cunningham.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.134
It's still a tie.
I haven't won anything yet.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.476
- You won! B-By forfeit.
- You don't win stuff by forfeit.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.209
Well, that's not what they
told me in Little League, Fonz.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.376
You got to understand
something-- this is life here.

09:46.486 --> 09:47.510
This ain't games.

09:47.621 --> 09:50.022
Now, are you driving for me
or not?

09:51.858 --> 09:53.348
All right.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.758
But you get your legs bit off
by that shark,

09:55.862 --> 09:57.887
don't you come running to me.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.990
Ha, ha, ha.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.254
<i>II</i>

10:42.442 --> 10:44.809
- What...?
- He's still gonna do it!

11:01.328 --> 11:03.160
RICHIE: Here we go, Fonz!
I'm heading for the ramp!

11:03.263 --> 11:05.288
Are you sure you want to do it?

11:26.453 --> 11:28.012
- Look at that shark, Pots.
- Yeah.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.611
How could you accept
the challenge?

11:29.723 --> 11:31.953
It wasn't me, it was you!

11:32.058 --> 11:33.583
("Vinéfli
I know. I know.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.252
It's okay, Malph. It's okay.

11:38.798 --> 11:40.323
JOANIE:
He's really gonna do it!

11:49.909 --> 11:50.967
POTSIE:
He's ready to make the jump!

12:01.087 --> 12:02.179
RALPH:
There he goes!

12:14.934 --> 12:16.925
(onlookers cheering)

12:24.077 --> 12:26.068
(cheering)

12:32.452 --> 12:34.284
(cheering, whooping)

12:44.064 --> 12:46.590
(crowd cheering, applauding)

12:48.835 --> 12:51.634
(crowd whooping)

12:51.738 --> 12:55.641
RALPH:
All right, all right!

12:55.742 --> 12:57.642
POTSIE:
Hey, we're his best friends.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.610
Yeah, we waxed his skis.

12:59.713 --> 13:01.442
Fonzie didn't get eaten up.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.346
(everyone laughs)

13:03.450 --> 13:06.442
POTSIE:
Come on, it's great!

13:07.620 --> 13:09.088
So I made a mistake.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.313
FONZIE:
Red...

13:11.424 --> 13:12.914
we did it.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.960
Yeah, yeah,
you did the challenge.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.119
Yeah. (laughs)

13:16.229 --> 13:17.719
But... but what
did you really win?

13:17.831 --> 13:20.061
Aw, come on, Red,
how often does a guy like me

13:20.166 --> 13:22.225
get to bump off a guy like that?

13:22.335 --> 13:24.531
I mean, he's got
the best boat money can buy,

13:24.637 --> 13:26.833
he's got custom skis,
he's got a Porsche.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.237
Yeah, he does, he does.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.537
He gets everything handed
to him on a silver platter.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.906
Yeah, but the thing is...

13:32.011 --> 13:33.445
you and me, Red,
we're different.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.672
See, we're doers.

13:34.781 --> 13:35.805
We're doers.

13:35.915 --> 13:36.973
Yeah.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.312
Yeah, we are.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.785
But does that mean we have
to accept every challenge?

13:40.887 --> 13:43.549
No, I'm a very flexible person.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.590
You know, when I was
shooting over that ramp,

13:45.692 --> 13:47.353
flying over that shark,

13:47.460 --> 13:49.519
something my grandfather said
came right back to me.

13:49.629 --> 13:50.926
Yeah, you should remember it,

13:51.030 --> 13:52.225
climbing up that ladder
to stardom.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.299
What?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.300
He said life is filled
with challenges.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.699
You take 'em all.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.168
Except those that are gonna
break your neck.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.261
(chuckles)

13:59.372 --> 14:00.498
Course, he said it in Italian.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.234
(laughs)

14:02.342 --> 14:05.573
So you knew all the time that
you were gonna make it, huh?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.578
Yeah, I did.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.943
Well...

14:09.048 --> 14:11.517
deep down, I... I knew
you were gonna make it, too.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.746
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.218
I wasn't sure the shark knew.

14:15.321 --> 14:16.618
The shark?!

14:16.723 --> 14:19.090
(both chuckle)

14:19.192 --> 14:21.354
<i>RICHIE: You know,
signing a <i>movie contract</i></i>

14:21.461 --> 14:24.123
is almost as scary
as jumping over a shark.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.221
Oh, man.

14:26.332 --> 14:28.323
$200 a week, that's...

14:28.435 --> 14:29.664
that's really a lot of money.

14:29.769 --> 14:30.964
JOANIE:
Oh, wow.

14:31.070 --> 14:34.836
50 new Big Bopper albums
every seven days.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.636
And that's just for openers.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.768
Yeah, but it's
a five-year contract.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.437
That's five years
out of my life.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.572
Howard, if Richard
signs the contract,

14:42.682 --> 14:44.548
would we all move to Hollywood?

14:44.651 --> 14:46.415
Well, I think he's
perfectly capable

14:46.519 --> 14:48.317
of living out here
alone, sweetheart.

14:48.421 --> 14:51.049
Well, to play it safe,
better send me with him.

14:52.358 --> 14:53.587
Nice try.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.094
It's a five-year contract...

14:57.197 --> 14:58.892
and there's no guarantee
of-of success,

14:58.998 --> 15:00.090
let alone being a star.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.361
I know.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.527
You throw your dice
and you take your chance.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.798
Go, stay. What's the big deal?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.896
Mom and Dad'll always have me.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.339
Go to your room.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.707
My room is your room, Dad.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.576
Well, then go to the beach.

15:14.681 --> 15:15.705
Sent to the beach.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.078
I love California!

15:18.251 --> 15:20.447
But you stay away from
that Sandy character

15:20.553 --> 15:22.214
and all those muscle men.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.313
Oh, Dad.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.825
Well...

15:26.926 --> 15:28.087
Yes, Mom?

15:28.194 --> 15:31.630
I love you and I think
that you will be a star

15:31.731 --> 15:33.859
at whatever you do.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.800
I picked one winner
and I can pick another.

15:36.903 --> 15:39.167
Mm-hmm. Thank you, sweetheart.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.240
Just for that, you can
go to the gift shop

15:41.341 --> 15:44.641
and buy that slice of driftwood
that you wanted.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.872
- Thank you, Howard.
- Mm-hmm.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.971
I'll go get your wallet.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.613
Your mother wants me to make
a lamp out of that driftwood.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.951
I don't know how to make a lamp.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.286
I could never get the wire
in the socket

15:59.392 --> 16:00.951
that goes into the lamp.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.051
I also can't get the wire
into the plug

16:03.162 --> 16:04.789
that goes at the other end...

16:04.898 --> 16:06.593
You don't want to
hear this, do you?

16:06.699 --> 16:08.098
Well, it's just, uh...

16:08.201 --> 16:09.999
Yeah, you're a little worried
about this, aren't you?

16:10.103 --> 16:11.468
I sure am.

16:11.571 --> 16:15.235
Well, I'm sorry, Richard,
I guess I just got carried away.

16:15.341 --> 16:18.276
You know, a movie contract
and everything.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.641
You see, your mother and I

16:19.746 --> 16:22.306
always planned for you
to go to college.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.247
In fact,
you're already registered.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.512
So you think I should forget
about this and just, uh...

16:26.619 --> 16:27.609
just go to school?

16:27.720 --> 16:28.915
Well, now, I didn't say that.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.013
After all, a Hollywood contract
is very exciting.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.888
Yeah.

16:32.992 --> 16:37.327
But, uh, sometimes I wish
I was Ozzie Nelson.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.524
Then it would be easy,
because Ozzie would say,

16:39.632 --> 16:42.431
"You're going to college
and that's it."

16:42.535 --> 16:44.162
Straight out.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.170
But the best I can do for you

16:46.272 --> 16:49.242
is to just talk it outwith you.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.539
I don't think you really want me
to tell you what to do, do you?

16:53.813 --> 16:55.440
No.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.245
I guess it's my life,
and it's got to be my decision.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.911
Mm. Well, Richard...

17:02.655 --> 17:05.589
I know that whatever decision
you make, I'll be proud of you.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.319
You're my son and you've

17:07.426 --> 17:10.419
never given me cause
to be anything but proud.

17:33.319 --> 17:35.344
<i>II</i>

17:44.597 --> 17:46.588
That's your decision, huh?

17:48.534 --> 17:50.935
Yeah.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.402
200 bucks a week,

17:52.505 --> 17:54.473
that's a lot of tune-ups.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.441
Well, Fonz,

17:57.543 --> 17:59.739
being a movie star,

17:59.846 --> 18:01.473
that's not my dream.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.175
What I really want
is to be a journalist.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.274
People are gonna think
I'm bananas.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.945
Let me tell you something, Red,

18:08.054 --> 18:10.682
the important thing is you do
what you want to do,

18:10.790 --> 18:12.815
not what you think other people
think you should do.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.257
- Yeah, I know, I know.
- Hey, I'm not finished yet.

18:15.361 --> 18:18.331
Now, you got to enjoy what it is
that you're doing,

18:18.431 --> 18:21.264
because you're gonna spend
a lot of time doing it.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.835
You dig? Look at me.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.336
(Richie chuckles)

18:25.438 --> 18:27.839
Yeah, but who wouldn't want
to have all your women, Fonz?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.237
Hey, that's true,

18:29.342 --> 18:31.868
but I'm talking
about auto repair.

18:31.978 --> 18:35.209
A lot of people don't want
to get their fingernails dirty,

18:35.314 --> 18:37.248
you dig, but I love
being a mechanic,

18:37.350 --> 18:39.819
and I'm very good at it,
and that's what's cool.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.250
I see what you mean.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.686
See, I-l don't know
if I could ever act,

18:43.790 --> 18:46.191
but I know
that I can write good.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.623
No, no, no, that's "well."

18:47.727 --> 18:49.388
- Whether you could write well.
- Oh, yeah...

18:49.495 --> 18:52.089
Don't let it ever be said
that the Fonz

18:52.198 --> 18:54.098
don't talk good. Heyyy.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.669
Let's go home, Red.
Let's go home.

18:56.769 --> 18:57.964
Lead the way.

18:58.071 --> 18:59.800
I'll tell you, Fonz,

18:59.906 --> 19:01.465
this trip sure was
a great last fling

19:01.574 --> 19:02.735
before starting college.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.276
FONZIE: Yeah, next week,
you, Potsie and Ralph

19:04.377 --> 19:06.106
become collegiate types.
I like that.

19:06.212 --> 19:08.010
I like hanging out
with college men.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.513
RICHIE: You mean it's good
for your image

19:09.615 --> 19:11.777
to be with intelligent,
educated guys like us?

19:11.884 --> 19:15.047
FONZIE: No, I mean it's a great
new way to meet college chicks.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.145
(Fonzie laughing)

19:24.897 --> 19:26.387
(rock 'n' roll playing)

19:26.499 --> 19:28.991
♪ Why don't you kiss me
and you'll find out, yeah... ♪

19:31.003 --> 19:34.633
(sighs) Another day,
another dollar.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.073
You keep your money
in a coffee can, Al?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.611
Yeah, it's safe enough till
I get it home in my mattress.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.113
Oh, don't you use banks?

19:42.215 --> 19:44.081
(chuckles)
Only for change.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.548
Oh, here, I'll save you a trip.

19:45.651 --> 19:46.948
Wow.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.111
You had a good day.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.121
Oh, yeah,
between my regular clientele

19:50.223 --> 19:51.816
and the people cousin Fonzie
sends me,

19:51.924 --> 19:53.016
I do all right.

19:53.126 --> 19:54.184
Oh, that's two bucks.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.785
(chuckles)

19:56.896 --> 19:59.297
Boy, I wonder where
everybody is.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.366
Their plane landed an hour ago.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.026
Yeah, they said
they were gonna come by,

20:03.136 --> 20:04.399
but you know,
maybe it got too late

20:04.504 --> 20:05.801
and they just went on home.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.204
Oh, good night, Rosa.

20:08.307 --> 20:11.106
Yeah... good night, Rosa.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.010
Wah, wah, wah.

20:14.113 --> 20:17.640
Chachi, Chachi,
she's too old for you.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.549
Al, do you know
what she does for me?

20:20.653 --> 20:22.246
Rosa?

20:22.355 --> 20:23.754
From my parish?

20:23.856 --> 20:25.346
What?

20:25.458 --> 20:29.452
She puts chocolate, hot fudge,

20:29.562 --> 20:31.496
and butterscotch

20:31.597 --> 20:32.962
on my sundaes.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.226
(chuckles)

20:34.333 --> 20:35.459
That's nice.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.776
Well, how was Hollywood?

20:46.879 --> 20:47.903
Did you have fun?

20:48.014 --> 20:49.072
Was it exciting?

20:49.182 --> 20:50.172
Oh, you should've been there.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.773
Fonzie almost killed himself.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.080
Yeah, I'll tell you,
those-those Hollywood chicks

20:54.187 --> 20:55.882
are something, you know?

20:55.988 --> 20:57.956
Fonz, I think she's talking
about the shark, you know...

20:58.057 --> 20:59.252
Oh, yeah.

20:59.358 --> 21:00.757
Sharks? Girls?

21:00.860 --> 21:02.191
I'll tell you later.

21:02.295 --> 21:05.856
Chachi, oh, we have
a nice little souvenir for you.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.194
- Joanie?
- Oh.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.394
Joanie, just what
I always wanted.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.493
Uh, not me, squirt-- this.

21:14.373 --> 21:15.841
Hey, that's great.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.001
Thanks, everybody.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.078
Especially you, blue eyes.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.977
Put your lips in neutral.

21:23.683 --> 21:26.778
Now, you been taking care
of business since I was gone?

21:26.886 --> 21:28.411
Oh, yeah, I did real good, Fonz.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.955
Eight new phone numbers.

21:31.591 --> 21:34.322
All right, Jane and Joan,
the twins-- hey.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.896
Millie, Beatrice...

21:36.996 --> 21:38.464
Beatrice.

21:38.564 --> 21:40.464
L-I promised to take her
to Hollywood.

21:40.566 --> 21:41.692
I forgot.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.065
Well, I'll let her ride my bike.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.229
I better go call her;
I'll see you later.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.397
- Bye.
- Bye, Fonz.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.065
Now, Chachi,
I hope that sweatshirt

21:49.175 --> 21:50.540
is the right size.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.135
Oh, it'll look great
once I cut off the sleeves.

21:53.246 --> 21:54.407
Well, thanks everybody.

21:54.513 --> 21:55.947
- See you.
- Bye.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.516
AL:
Wah, wah, wah.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.210
(chuckles)

21:59.318 --> 22:00.444
Hey, you know...
(chuckles)

22:00.553 --> 22:02.282
a Hollywood sweatshirt,

22:02.388 --> 22:04.482
all the way from California,
that's nice.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.149
- Yeah.
- For Chachi.

22:06.259 --> 22:09.456
It's good when you have friends
who-who bring presents.

22:09.562 --> 22:12.054
Especially when you don't
go anywhere yourself.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.928
It's-it's so nice
when they do that.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.900
Dad, maybe you should give it
to him before the man cries.

22:17.003 --> 22:17.993
All right.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.402
Here you are.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.304
This is from all of us, Al.

22:22.408 --> 22:23.398
Oh.

22:24.710 --> 22:25.472
"Hollywood."

22:25.578 --> 22:26.568
RICHIE: Yeah.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.078
You can hear the ocean in there.

22:31.918 --> 22:34.580
(everyone laughing)

22:34.687 --> 22:36.655
Hey, hey, Al,

22:36.756 --> 22:38.485
here's the thing you wanted
Ralph and me to get.

22:38.591 --> 22:39.922
Oh, uh, thanks, Potsie.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.084
- Listen, was Hollywood really...
- Hey,

22:41.193 --> 22:42.888
Al, come on, put it on.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.190
- Later, eh?
- Aw.

22:44.297 --> 22:45.765
Did you see any movie stars
when you were...

22:45.865 --> 22:47.196
Come on, Al,
what do you mean, "Later"?

22:47.300 --> 22:48.461
We carried it all the way
from California.

22:48.567 --> 22:49.591
- Yeah, come on, Al.
- Yeah, Al.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.136
- Come on, Al, please?
- Put it on.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.831
- Put it on.
- Come on, Al-- here.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.499
- Let me see it.
- What did you get?

22:55.608 --> 22:56.700
- You'll see, you'll see.
- What is it?

22:56.809 --> 22:57.776
- Wait a minute.
- It's great, it's great.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.003
- You know what it is?
- All right...

22:59.111 --> 23:00.340
all right, all right, all right.

23:05.651 --> 23:07.176
Hi, boys and girls.

23:07.286 --> 23:08.776
What do you think?

23:08.888 --> 23:10.378
Oh, it's you, Al,
definitely you.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.048
I gotta go. Come on.

23:12.158 --> 23:13.592
- Come on, Pots.
- Okay.

23:13.693 --> 23:15.320
Wait a minute!

23:15.428 --> 23:17.658
How am I gonna tell my mom
about busting her ironing board?

23:17.763 --> 23:20.095
How am I gonna tell my father
I'm back?

23:21.500 --> 23:23.025
- So long, friend.
- Well, it was nice.

23:23.135 --> 23:24.330
- Hey, thanks everybody.
- See you later, Al.

23:24.437 --> 23:26.633
- Thank you; it's so nice.
- Glad you liked it.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.833
I'm-I'm-I'm
so happy with all this.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.773
- Yeah.
- This is so much fun.

23:30.876 --> 23:33.311
Friends... (sniffling)

23:33.412 --> 23:36.541
Is it true, though,
what they say about Hollywood?

23:36.649 --> 23:38.583
Oh, yeah, it's amazing.

23:38.684 --> 23:40.174
Boy, you wouldn't believe...

23:40.286 --> 23:43.654
They put lettuce and tomatoes
on hamburgers, huh?

23:43.756 --> 23:46.282
Yeah, yeah, that glamorous.

23:46.392 --> 23:47.587
- Boy...!
- And sometimes...

23:47.693 --> 23:48.785
Yeah?

23:48.894 --> 23:50.055
...EVEI1 mayonnaise.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.462
Oh! Fonzie, we're leaving!

23:55.568 --> 23:57.764
Turn off the lights
and lock the place, will you?

23:57.870 --> 23:58.928
Mayonnaise?

23:59.038 --> 24:01.029

24:15.421 --> 24:17.412

24:22.261 --> 24:23.751
