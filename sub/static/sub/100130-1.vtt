00:10.009 --> 00:13.046
Hello, anybody home?

00:13.209 --> 00:15.723
Sister witches, guess what.

00:17.049 --> 00:20.564
- Oh, are you nuts?
- What are you doing?

00:20.769 --> 00:22.168
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:25.129 --> 00:26.960
"Sister witches"?
I can't believe you said that.

00:27.129 --> 00:29.085
- What's the matter with you?
- How was I to know

00:29.249 --> 00:30.398
you'd be here with anybody?

00:30.569 --> 00:34.198
Last I heard you were meeting
a banker friend about the loan.

00:35.929 --> 00:38.284
- Is this the credit check?
- It's not what you think.

00:38.489 --> 00:41.242
We were just...
We were just kissing, that's all.

00:41.449 --> 00:44.088
You don't have to justify it.
You're single, you're responsible,

00:44.249 --> 00:46.558
you're way overdue in the
sex department, I say go for it.

00:46.729 --> 00:48.640
I'm not way overdue.

00:49.289 --> 00:51.803
All right, maybe a little,
but that's besides the point.

00:51.969 --> 00:54.881
I would never just sleep with a guy
to get something, you know that.

00:55.049 --> 00:57.040
Give yourself a break.
You're going through a lot.

00:57.209 --> 01:01.646
No job, straining to buy the club,
you haven't heard from Leo in weeks.

01:01.849 --> 01:04.568
All right, well, the preview is at 5
and the auction's Sunday at 11.

01:04.729 --> 01:07.163
Oh, no, Prue, go back outside.
Go on, hurry.

01:09.529 --> 01:10.723
Okay.

01:15.529 --> 01:18.805
- So you must be Prue.
- No, actually.

01:18.969 --> 01:21.437
All right, great.
Yeah, I'll see you then.

01:21.609 --> 01:23.088
She's Prue. I'm Phoebe.

01:23.769 --> 01:26.203
Rob, can we take a rain check
on the rest of the evening?

01:26.369 --> 01:27.802
It's getting kind of crowded in here.

01:27.969 --> 01:30.278
- Okay, sure.
- Yeah, okay.

01:32.169 --> 01:35.047
So I'll meet you tomorrow
at the club at noon.

01:35.209 --> 01:36.358
Great. Thanks for dinner.

01:36.849 --> 01:39.124
- Okay. All right. Bye.
- Bye. See you.

01:41.289 --> 01:43.928
- So did you get the loan?
- Hopefully. I'll find out tomorrow.

01:44.249 --> 01:45.921
Well, my fingers are crossed.

01:47.609 --> 01:49.440
Wait. You guys,
where are you going?

01:49.609 --> 01:52.123
Oh, I have an auction coming up,
I have clients to call.

01:52.289 --> 01:55.599
Wait, you guys, don't you
even know what tomorrow is?

01:57.089 --> 02:01.321
It's our one-year anniversary
of becoming witches. Hello.

02:01.489 --> 02:04.083
- Tomorrow is, really?
- So...

02:04.289 --> 02:07.645
"So"? "So"? It's a day to celebrate.

02:08.008 --> 02:09.442
Not just because
it's our anniversary.

02:09.609 --> 02:13.204
But because it falls on one of the most
powerful Wiccan days of the year,

02:13.369 --> 02:14.927
the autumnal equinox.

02:15.089 --> 02:17.967
Now, according to this witch
that I met today at the bookstore...

02:18.129 --> 02:19.528
Hold it, a witch?

02:20.169 --> 02:22.478
You didn't tell her about us, did you?

02:22.649 --> 02:24.128
Well, yeah, sure I did. Why not?

02:24.289 --> 02:27.725
I mean, I didn't tell her that we're
magical witches, obviously.

02:29.289 --> 02:32.679
Look, I'm sorry, but I think
after everything we've been through,

02:32.849 --> 02:35.761
it's important to learn as much
as we can about who we are.

02:35.929 --> 02:37.362
Forewarned is forearmed.

02:37.889 --> 02:39.845
And I think that we should leave
well enough alone.

02:40.009 --> 02:42.477
I mean we've been demon-free
for over a month now.

02:42.649 --> 02:44.879
- I'd like to keep it that way.
- Amen to that.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074

03:01.889 --> 03:04.119
Prue! Piper!

03:06.329 --> 03:08.718
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

03:11.049 --> 03:13.563
Why does the book do that?
How does the book do that?

03:15.409 --> 03:19.402
"Rite of passage, fight it with
the power of one or else."

03:41.409 --> 03:43.001
What the hell was that?

03:43.249 --> 03:46.047
The Book of Shadows.
Where's the Book of Shadows?

03:48.529 --> 03:50.679
So much for being demon-free.

05:23.329 --> 05:25.399
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing.

05:25.649 --> 05:30.040
Whatever it was came out of nowhere
and disappeared into nowhere.

05:30.209 --> 05:32.086
Well, it took the Book of Shadows
somewhere.

05:32.289 --> 05:35.599
And he's powerful too. No other
demon's been able to steal the book.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.283
Oh, but if he's so powerful,
then why didn't he kill us?

05:38.569 --> 05:41.003
He probably didn't
want to go up against you.

05:41.169 --> 05:42.158
Me? What do you mean?

05:42.329 --> 05:43.762
That's what the
Book of Shadows says.

05:43.929 --> 05:46.363
"Fight it with the power of one."
That's gotta mean your power,

05:46.529 --> 05:47.803
- it's the strongest.
- Says who?

05:47.969 --> 05:51.041
Says every demon or warlock
we've ever gone up against.

05:51.209 --> 05:53.439
She's right, Prue, the power
of one's gotta mean you,

05:53.609 --> 05:55.600
otherwise it would have said
the power of three.

05:55.769 --> 05:57.885
The only question is,
how are we gonna find this demon?

05:58.049 --> 05:59.528
We don't know anything about him.

05:59.689 --> 06:01.361
Well, we better think
of something fast,

06:01.529 --> 06:04.805
because without the Book of Shadows,
we're not the Charmed Ones anymore.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.602
Coming!

06:21.289 --> 06:23.564
- Hi.
- Can I use your phone, please?

06:23.929 --> 06:27.558
- Well, actually we're...
- Please, it's an emergency. Please?

06:27.809 --> 06:29.959
Okay, come on in.
It's right around that corner.

06:35.809 --> 06:38.562
- Are you out of your mind?
- What was I supposed to do, say no?

06:38.729 --> 06:40.606
- Look at that poor girl.
- Jenny?

06:41.769 --> 06:43.885
Jenny, come on, talk to me.

06:45.129 --> 06:47.927
International operator, please.
Saudi Arabia.

06:48.089 --> 06:51.001
- Saudi Arabia?
- I'm sorry.

06:51.169 --> 06:52.284
We're moving in next door,

06:52.449 --> 06:55.122
or at least we're trying to.
The phone's not hooked up yet.

06:55.289 --> 06:59.487
- So you're our new neighbours?
- Name's Dan. Dan Gordon.

06:59.649 --> 07:02.482
I don't care if the circuits are busy.
I have to talk to my mom.

07:02.769 --> 07:05.886
And that's my niece, Jenny,
who is obviously not talking to me.

07:07.129 --> 07:10.166
Jenny? Sweetie, come on.

07:14.209 --> 07:17.918
- I'm sorry. It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

07:20.329 --> 07:21.398
I saw him first.

07:22.249 --> 07:24.240
Demons now, drooling later.

07:24.409 --> 07:26.240
I have to meet my client
before the preview.

07:26.409 --> 07:27.478
Oh, wait a minute.

07:27.689 --> 07:30.044
The scariest demon
we've ever run across

07:30.209 --> 07:32.200
opens up some portal in our attic

07:32.369 --> 07:35.441
and steals the Book of Shadows,
and you want to go into the office?

07:39.009 --> 07:40.283
What's the matter with her?

07:40.889 --> 07:44.006
It's the first demon
she's faced since Andy died.

07:44.169 --> 07:46.205
Maybe it's bringing up
some bad memories.

08:21.569 --> 08:24.686
- What are we doing here?
- Celebrating the equinox.

08:24.849 --> 08:28.000
Can't you just feel it?
The energy in this place?

08:28.169 --> 08:30.637
- It's a convergence.
- It's a crock.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.529
I thought we were supposed to
meet your witch friend.

08:33.688 --> 08:35.839
We are. This is where
she told us to meet her.

08:36.009 --> 08:38.203
- Now, please, just relax.
- Relax.

08:38.369 --> 08:42.157
My life was a mess before our little
wake-up call this morning, remember?

08:44.449 --> 08:45.643
Oh, Stevie.

08:47.129 --> 08:49.802
Hey, Phoebe.
I'm so glad you could make it.

08:49.969 --> 08:53.325
Actually we're not here for this. We
needed to talk to you about something.

08:53.489 --> 08:54.717
This is my sister Piper.

08:54.929 --> 08:57.159
- Hi.
- Hey, Piper. It's very nice to meet you.

08:58.649 --> 09:00.241
Are you a witch too?

09:01.089 --> 09:03.478
Sort of. Maybe. I don't know.

09:03.649 --> 09:06.447
Is everybody here one also?

09:06.609 --> 09:09.487
Oh, no. No, no, no.
It's just a group of believers.

09:10.049 --> 09:13.121
Women who know of this special place
and have come to celebrate.

09:14.129 --> 09:16.359
By the way, happy anniversary.

09:16.649 --> 09:18.480
That's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

09:18.649 --> 09:22.198
Why did you say that today
was gonna be a powerful day for us?

09:22.369 --> 09:24.485
Because your anniversary
falls on the equinox,

09:24.729 --> 09:27.368
which is a powerful day
in and of itself.

09:27.569 --> 09:31.198
For you, this convergence of powers
is even stronger,

09:31.369 --> 09:33.837
the potential greater.

09:34.009 --> 09:35.886
All you have to do is connect.

09:38.649 --> 09:41.800
- You wanna try it?
- Try it? How?

09:42.129 --> 09:44.040
Let us begin.

09:44.489 --> 09:46.081
- I don't wanna connect.
- We have to connect.

09:46.249 --> 09:47.238
I don't wanna try it.

09:47.409 --> 09:49.559
- Okay, but we have to because...
- Why?

09:49.729 --> 09:52.038
What have we got to lose, okay?

09:55.689 --> 09:58.522
Well, apparently we've got
our clothes to lose.

09:58.689 --> 10:01.283
- I see that.
- No.

10:01.449 --> 10:02.962
Whoa! Whoa, wait!
What are you doing?

10:03.129 --> 10:04.118
When in Rome.

10:04.289 --> 10:07.486
No, no. We're not in Rome, Phoebe.
We're in California, and it's illegal here.

10:07.689 --> 10:10.840
It's totally natural, okay?
Go for it. Come on.

10:11.009 --> 10:13.648
God. This is ridiculous.

10:13.809 --> 10:16.198
- Can I keep my shoes on?
- Yeah, but that's it.

10:16.369 --> 10:20.123
- We have absolutely zero information.
- Everybody's naked, not just you.

10:20.289 --> 10:23.201
- And now we're naked.
- Okay?

10:24.529 --> 10:27.123
The power of three.

10:27.609 --> 10:29.486
- Did you just hear that?
- Hear what?

10:29.929 --> 10:31.647
The power of three.

10:31.809 --> 10:33.208
That.

10:33.969 --> 10:36.244
- Grams.
- Grams? What? Where?

10:36.409 --> 10:38.445
I don't hear anything.

10:45.169 --> 10:46.318
Mrs Milton?

10:46.529 --> 10:48.360
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

10:48.569 --> 10:51.003
Oh, no problem.
I was just looking around.

10:51.169 --> 10:53.478
I think that we'll have
a great turnout for the preview.

10:53.649 --> 10:56.117
We've gotten an excellent
response to your husband's collection.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.166
I'm not surprised.

10:59.689 --> 11:04.080
Now, the opening bid prices may look
a little low, but don't worry.

11:04.249 --> 11:07.047
It should attract a lot of buyers,
which should result in a bidding war.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.564
It's the best way to sell inventory
like this at top dollar.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.045
Is that all right with you?

11:14.209 --> 11:16.165
I guess I'm having
a little more trouble letting go

11:16.329 --> 11:18.320
of John's things than I thought.

11:18.489 --> 11:20.445
That's only natural. It's not easy.

11:20.609 --> 11:23.169
I suppose that you
deal with death

11:23.329 --> 11:25.285
quite a bit in your line of work,
don't you?

11:25.529 --> 11:30.319
I mean, like this, auctioning off
some poor widow's inheritance.

11:30.489 --> 11:33.879
This. Unfortunately, yes.

11:34.049 --> 11:36.882
L... I just keep going over
and over in my mind

11:37.049 --> 11:39.927
the last time I saw him
before the accident.

11:40.089 --> 11:42.045
And I keep thinking if only

11:42.209 --> 11:45.326
I'd done something or said something

11:45.489 --> 11:49.277
to stop him from getting in the car,
maybe he'd still be alive.

12:15.329 --> 12:17.923
Oh, God. Rob, I'm so sorry I'm late.

12:18.089 --> 12:21.445
I got stuck at this thing, and then
my sister needed a ride, and I'm...

12:21.769 --> 12:23.725
So I'm totally screwed
on the loan now, aren't I?

12:23.889 --> 12:26.767
Don't be ridiculous. I'm just looking
around, checking things out.

12:27.209 --> 12:31.088
It needs a lot of work, I know that.
But that's not a problem.

12:31.249 --> 12:34.161
Just because the last two owners went
bankrupt doesn't mean it can't work.

12:34.329 --> 12:36.479
I've done three separate
marketing studies

12:36.649 --> 12:40.119
and found a 68-percent interest
in the target clientele.

12:40.289 --> 12:41.483
- Piper...
- Running a restaurant

12:41.649 --> 12:43.082
is very similar to running a club.

12:43.249 --> 12:46.685
You've already shown me all this.
I've got it, I've got everything...

12:46.849 --> 12:48.726
...except for an understanding

12:48.889 --> 12:51.926
of why you want to put yourself
in a position to fail like this.

12:53.329 --> 12:55.399
Clubs are an extremely
high-risk business.

12:55.569 --> 12:56.843
Piper, you could lose your shirt.

12:57.369 --> 12:59.678
Well, it wouldn't be the first time today.

12:59.849 --> 13:03.364
Look, I know what I'm getting
myself into. I know the risks.

13:03.529 --> 13:04.723
Actually it's a lot less risk

13:04.889 --> 13:07.119
and a lot less expensive
than starting my own restaurant,

13:07.289 --> 13:09.120
which is what I really wanted to do.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.644
The point is, I'm tired
of working for somebody else

13:11.809 --> 13:13.606
and helping them
realize their dreams.

13:14.009 --> 13:16.125
I want to run my own place.
This place.

13:16.289 --> 13:19.167
And I can do it too,
but not without your help.

13:20.369 --> 13:24.965
Well, at the risk of your never
wanting to go out with me again...

13:25.129 --> 13:26.278
...congratulations.

13:27.489 --> 13:29.764
- I got it?
- You got it.

13:30.249 --> 13:32.001
Yay.

13:49.929 --> 13:52.682
Were you vanquished
by the Charmed Ones?

13:53.369 --> 13:55.519
Yeah. Why?

13:55.809 --> 13:58.687
I'm giving you a second chance.

14:02.449 --> 14:05.600
The power of three.

14:05.769 --> 14:07.566
- Did you hear that?
- The power of three.

14:07.729 --> 14:09.606
- Hear what?
- Grams?

14:14.329 --> 14:15.478
You're dead, witch.

14:17.689 --> 14:20.920
Oh, my God. Jeremy?

14:23.969 --> 14:25.721
- Hello.
- Prue, thank God you're there.

14:25.889 --> 14:27.845
- Jeremy just attacked me.
- Piper, calm down.

14:28.489 --> 14:31.606
Jeremy? That is impossible.
We vanquished him a year ago.

14:31.769 --> 14:34.158
Well, apparently he got
unvanquished somehow.

14:34.329 --> 14:35.842
And since we don't have the book,

14:36.009 --> 14:38.728
we'll have to remember the spell
together. I'm conferencing Phoebe.

14:39.929 --> 14:42.238
- Phoebe, are you there?
- AT&T power of three.

14:42.409 --> 14:45.799
Okay, wait, wasn't that it?
"The power of three will set us free"?

14:46.369 --> 14:47.643
Grams.

14:49.929 --> 14:51.726
- What's the matter?
- He's...

14:52.849 --> 14:55.886
He's fighting through my freezes.
He's adjusting or something.

14:56.049 --> 14:58.404
Okay, put us on speakerphone.
We have to say it together.

15:01.849 --> 15:03.487
You're not getting away
from me this time.

15:05.169 --> 15:06.158
Piper!

15:09.369 --> 15:11.883
- Piper.
- Hurry, now! Hurry, now, now, now!

15:12.049 --> 15:14.483
- The power of three will set us free
- The power of three will set us free

15:14.649 --> 15:17.447
The power of three will set us free
The power of three will set us...

15:21.329 --> 15:23.240
- Piper?
- Piper?

15:25.529 --> 15:27.121
Piper?

15:27.289 --> 15:29.519
It's okay, he's gone...

15:29.689 --> 15:30.724
...again.

15:46.609 --> 15:49.077
How can you not have seen
who attacked me?

15:49.249 --> 15:50.238
How is that possible?

15:50.729 --> 15:52.685
I don't know, I guess
I was blocked or something,

15:52.849 --> 15:55.079
and then, he just
sort of disappeared, you know?

15:55.249 --> 15:57.240
I'm starting to understand
why this place keeps going under.

15:57.609 --> 16:00.328
Oh, no, it's not
a bad crime area, not at all.

16:00.489 --> 16:02.400
Well, it's something
I'm gonna be checking into.

16:02.569 --> 16:04.207
I can assure you of that.

16:04.689 --> 16:06.441
Excuse me, ma'am.

16:11.409 --> 16:13.525
Yeah, hey. How you doing?

16:15.129 --> 16:16.847
Are you okay?

16:17.009 --> 16:19.523
Physically, yeah.
I think my loan's on shaky ground.

16:19.689 --> 16:23.568
I couldn't exactly tell Rob, "It was
just a warlock, don't worry about it."

16:23.729 --> 16:26.004
Oh, it would be a shame
if the loan didn't work out.

16:26.169 --> 16:29.684
I mean, this place is great.
I used to come here.

16:29.849 --> 16:32.841
- It has a lot of potential.
- Yeah, you think so?

16:33.009 --> 16:35.477
Care to loan me 60 grand?

16:35.649 --> 16:37.446
Any ideas on where
Jeremy came from?

16:37.609 --> 16:40.169
No, but I don't want to run
into any of the other demons

16:40.329 --> 16:41.444
we've already vanquished.

16:41.609 --> 16:44.282
Hopefully Phoebe can find some
answers in those new books of hers.

16:44.449 --> 16:46.485
I sure wish
she had our book to look at.

16:46.649 --> 16:49.243
Feels kind of lost without it.

16:49.529 --> 16:51.838
- Although...
- Although what?

16:52.009 --> 16:55.524
It was weird, but right before Jeremy
appeared, I swore I heard Grams.

16:55.689 --> 16:57.566
- Grams?
- I was positive it was her.

16:57.729 --> 16:58.957
She said, "The power of three."

16:59.169 --> 17:01.205
And Phoebe said
she heard her say it this morning.

17:01.409 --> 17:04.162
Maybe Grams was trying
to warn me. Warn us.

17:30.129 --> 17:31.642
Hey there.

17:31.969 --> 17:34.881
- It's Jenny, right?
- Yeah.

17:35.369 --> 17:39.157
We didn't really get to say hello before.
My name is Phoebe.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.917
Phoebe Halliwell.
And this is Kit, the cat.

17:42.089 --> 17:44.478
Get it? Kit cat?
Little play on words.

17:46.449 --> 17:49.839
- So shouldn't you be in school?
- I'm taking the week off.

17:50.289 --> 17:52.166
- Really?
- For the move, you know?

17:52.369 --> 17:54.929
- So you're moving in with your uncle?
- Just for the school year,

17:55.089 --> 17:57.364
- until my mom and dad come back.
- From Saudi Arabia?

17:58.169 --> 18:00.478
My dad's with the State Department

18:00.649 --> 18:03.766
- so he gets transferred a lot.
- That sucks.

18:05.769 --> 18:07.964
So did you ever
get in touch with your mom?

18:08.129 --> 18:09.528
It doesn't matter.

18:10.569 --> 18:13.686
If it matters to you, it matters.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.880
Your secret's safe with me.

18:18.529 --> 18:22.920
Well, it's almost that time
of the month, you know? And...

18:23.089 --> 18:24.727
Well, I need some...

18:25.409 --> 18:27.365
- Tampons.
- Right, yeah.

18:27.529 --> 18:29.645
And you don't want to talk
to your uncle about it?

18:29.809 --> 18:32.482
But I did. But he went out
and bought sanitary napkins.

18:32.649 --> 18:33.684
Like that's gonna work.

18:35.289 --> 18:37.086
This is so embarrassing.

18:45.009 --> 18:47.728
So do you think maybe you could
get some for me instead?

18:48.409 --> 18:50.639
Sure, but...

18:52.289 --> 18:54.200
- The connection.
- But what?

18:59.889 --> 19:03.006
I'm really sorry, Jenny,
but I have to go.

19:03.169 --> 19:04.238
Fine.

19:06.129 --> 19:07.608
Look, I would love to help you out.

19:07.769 --> 19:10.522
But I believe that your parents
wouldn't have left you with your uncle

19:10.689 --> 19:14.204
if they didn't think you could trust him
with stuff like this.

19:14.369 --> 19:16.599
Ask him again.
And if he stills screws it up,

19:16.769 --> 19:22.287
remember, we're open 24 hours,
seven days a week, right next door.

19:24.769 --> 19:26.441
Piper, wait up.

19:26.809 --> 19:30.358
I think I figured out
how to find who the demon is.

19:30.529 --> 19:34.124
All we have to do
is ask the Book of Shadows.

19:34.289 --> 19:35.608
What?

19:35.769 --> 19:38.078
It's been right in front of us
the whole time.

19:38.289 --> 19:40.757
- Kit's collar?
- No! The triquetra,

19:40.929 --> 19:43.159
the symbol of the power of three,
our symbol.

19:43.329 --> 19:45.479
Maybe that's what Grams
has been trying to tell us.

19:45.649 --> 19:47.048
Phoebe, you're rambling.

19:47.209 --> 19:49.769
Stevie said all we would have
to do is find our connection, right?

19:50.169 --> 19:53.320
That if we did, we'd be able to tap
into the power of the equinox.

19:53.489 --> 19:54.968
Well this has got to be it.

19:55.129 --> 19:58.963
The triquetra, it's us. It's on the cover
of the Book of Shadows.

19:59.129 --> 20:01.359
I still don't understand
how we can ask the book for help

20:01.529 --> 20:03.997
when we don't have the book.

20:08.409 --> 20:09.558
The spirit board?

20:09.729 --> 20:11.640
It told us how to find
the Book of Shadows, right?

20:11.809 --> 20:14.198
It can do it again.
All you have to do is believe.

20:14.369 --> 20:16.007
Now, come on.
We're stronger together.

20:16.529 --> 20:18.121
- Okay.
- Come on.

20:18.289 --> 20:20.757
Okay, close your eyes and feel it.

20:21.289 --> 20:24.520
The power of three.

20:24.689 --> 20:26.884
- Did you hear that?
- Grams?

20:31.369 --> 20:34.406
- A.
- B.

20:35.529 --> 20:38.089
- R.
- A.

20:39.569 --> 20:41.366
X, A.

20:42.529 --> 20:43.564
S.

20:44.729 --> 20:45.878
Abraxas?

21:03.849 --> 21:05.248
Okay, I found it.

21:06.089 --> 21:09.877
"Abraxas, a demon of the astral plane
who destroys witches,

21:10.049 --> 21:12.358
by demonizing their powers."

21:12.729 --> 21:15.562
Okay, but what does that have to do
with the Book of Shadows?

21:15.729 --> 21:17.481
That's where our powers
come from, isn't it?

21:17.649 --> 21:19.605
Maybe Abraxas
is turning it evil somehow.

21:20.049 --> 21:22.358
That would definitely
undo our spells

21:22.529 --> 21:25.726
and explain why Jeremy
all of a sudden became unvanquished.

21:26.209 --> 21:27.881
And the Woogyman.

21:28.049 --> 21:29.801
When did the Woogyman
become unvanquished?

21:29.969 --> 21:32.039
A couple seconds ago.

21:35.489 --> 21:37.127
- Freeze it.
- It doesn't freeze, remember?

21:37.289 --> 21:39.359
The spell. What's the spell?

21:39.529 --> 21:40.598
Spell. Spell.

21:40.769 --> 21:43.966
I am light
I am one too strong to fight

21:45.129 --> 21:46.801
- I can't remember the rest.
- Yes, you can.

21:46.969 --> 21:48.800
Okay, we can.

21:49.529 --> 21:51.759
Return to dark where shadows dwell

21:51.969 --> 21:53.482
You cannot have this Halliwell

21:53.969 --> 21:58.406
Go away and leave my sight
And take with you this endless night

22:02.129 --> 22:06.884
- That wasn't so hard.
- It's a good thing we were together.

22:07.049 --> 22:09.768
Abraxas must be reading
the book backwards,

22:09.969 --> 22:12.437
- that's how he's turning it evil.
- How do you figure?

22:12.609 --> 22:14.998
The spell to vanquish Jeremy
was at the back of the book.

22:15.169 --> 22:17.842
And the spell to vanquish
the Woogyman was right before that.

22:18.049 --> 22:19.767
Which means more are on their way.

22:20.409 --> 22:21.808
We gotta warn Prue.

22:31.569 --> 22:33.082
What? What happened?

22:34.009 --> 22:36.000
I saw the warlock Nicholas...

22:36.569 --> 22:38.480
...killing Prue.

22:45.289 --> 22:47.439
Prue, your sister Phoebe's
on the phone.

22:48.609 --> 22:51.328
- Tell her that I'll call her back.
- She said it's important.

22:51.489 --> 22:53.320
She always says that it's important.

22:53.489 --> 22:56.128
Just tell her I'll call her back,
it's okay. Thanks.

22:58.249 --> 22:59.238
Mrs Milton?

22:59.409 --> 23:01.923
- Oh, hi.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

23:02.089 --> 23:05.479
I had no idea there would be
this many people interested.

23:05.649 --> 23:07.685
You're obviously
very good at your job.

23:07.849 --> 23:10.283
Actually, I think it says more about
your husband's collection

23:10.449 --> 23:12.041
than it does about me.

23:13.209 --> 23:15.598
How long has it been
since the accident?

23:16.409 --> 23:17.558
Eight and a half months.

23:19.089 --> 23:20.647
How long has it been for you?

23:22.129 --> 23:23.357
Not very long.

23:29.929 --> 23:30.964
Nicholas.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.001
Prue?

23:40.049 --> 23:42.244
You remember the feeling, don't you?

23:47.049 --> 23:53.887
Lavender, mimosa, holy thistle
Cleanse this evil from our midst

23:55.049 --> 23:58.166
You're overheating. Your brain cells
are frying. It's over.

23:58.689 --> 24:01.522
- Scatter its cells throughout time
- No!

24:01.729 --> 24:04.448
Let this Nick no more exist

24:18.049 --> 24:21.280
Well, your blood pressure's
back to normal.

24:21.449 --> 24:24.282
So is your temperature,
your electrolytes.

24:24.449 --> 24:27.725
If I didn't know any better, I'd say you
were a perfectly healthy young woman.

24:27.889 --> 24:30.926
- Does that mean I can go home now?
- Well, I'd like to run a few more tests.

24:31.329 --> 24:33.285
Find out what caused
your body temperature to rise

24:33.449 --> 24:35.041
spontaneously like that.

24:35.249 --> 24:37.046
Has that ever happened
to you before?

24:37.209 --> 24:38.961
It's happened to us all before.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.122
Doctor, it's okay, really.

24:42.329 --> 24:44.684
I know how to keep it
from happening again.

24:44.849 --> 24:47.488
Well, all right. I'll see to your
discharge papers then.

24:47.889 --> 24:50.119
- Thanks.
- All right.

24:53.809 --> 24:56.323
- That was close.
- Too close.

24:56.489 --> 24:59.447
No, I don't mean her, I mean you.
The paramedic said you almost died.

24:59.609 --> 25:01.042
Yeah, what else is new?

25:01.209 --> 25:03.677
We'd better figure out a way
to get the book back from Abraxas.

25:03.849 --> 25:04.964
If we don't, we're dead.

25:05.369 --> 25:07.405
But how? We don't know where
the astral plane is.

25:07.569 --> 25:08.684
Yes, we do.

25:08.849 --> 25:13.127
It coexists within our own plane,
remember? That's what Stevie said.

25:13.289 --> 25:15.007
Still doesn't help find the demon.

25:15.209 --> 25:17.769
Maybe, maybe not. I was thinking...

25:17.929 --> 25:19.999
You know how we always thought
that nobody could take

25:20.169 --> 25:22.319
the Book of Shadows
out of the house but us?

25:22.649 --> 25:23.968
Maybe nobody did.

25:24.129 --> 25:27.565
Maybe it's still in the house
just on a different plane.

25:27.729 --> 25:29.082
The astral plane.

25:29.249 --> 25:31.809
That would mean Abraxas
is still in the house too.

25:32.049 --> 25:35.758
Right. So we would need
to find a doorway or a window

25:35.929 --> 25:38.568
to get to his plane
like he used to get to ours.

25:38.729 --> 25:43.644
And we need to do this before the end
of the equinox by sunrise tomorrow.

25:43.809 --> 25:48.724
And then Prue can kick some
astral ass with the power of one.

25:58.009 --> 25:59.886
Prue, what's the matter?

26:00.089 --> 26:02.808
Nothing. I just think that
it's a long shot, that's all.

26:02.969 --> 26:04.243
Well, at least it's a shot.

26:04.409 --> 26:06.969
I agree. I mean who knows how
many other demons and warlocks

26:07.129 --> 26:09.040
he's let loose
that we just don't know about yet.

26:09.209 --> 26:11.598
Or even worse, if Abraxas
gets to the first page of the book

26:11.769 --> 26:13.919
- before we get to him, we're toast.
- Why?

26:14.089 --> 26:17.684
Because it's the incantation
that gave us our powers, remember?

26:17.849 --> 26:19.840
If Abraxas says that backwards too,

26:20.009 --> 26:21.886
then we'll lose them
and the book forever.

26:22.049 --> 26:24.438
So we go back to
leading normal lives again.

26:24.609 --> 26:26.361
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- What?

26:26.529 --> 26:29.441
- Are you joking?
- No, Phoebe, I'm not joking.

26:30.889 --> 26:35.360
Look, we always said that things
happen to us for a reason, right?

26:35.529 --> 26:37.918
So maybe the reason
this time is to give us an out.

26:38.129 --> 26:40.279
Prue, there's no out.
Abraxas will kill us.

26:40.449 --> 26:44.408
Not if all he wants is the book.
After all, that's the real power, not us.

26:44.609 --> 26:46.759
If all he wanted was the book,
he wouldn't keep sending

26:46.929 --> 26:47.998
demons and warlocks after us.

26:48.169 --> 26:50.967
We won't have to worry about
anymore if he gets to the first page.

26:51.129 --> 26:52.608
What are you saying, Prue?

26:52.769 --> 26:55.647
Look, if we don't get to him,
we stop being witches.

26:55.809 --> 26:59.404
Exactly. Which means we stop
risking our lives all the time.

27:00.729 --> 27:03.926
Which means we stop watching
the people we love lose theirs.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.763
- Prue.
- Let her be.

27:13.009 --> 27:14.442
We're screwed, you know.

27:15.209 --> 27:17.564
No, we're not.
If there's a window, we'll find it.

27:17.729 --> 27:19.526
That's not what I meant.

27:20.529 --> 27:23.805
- She'll come around.
- By sunrise? You know how Prue is

27:23.969 --> 27:27.041
when she makes up her mind
about something. That's it.

27:27.209 --> 27:29.848
- We're screwed.
- And we're out of wine.

27:31.129 --> 27:33.279
I'll get it, you keep dreaming.

27:40.609 --> 27:42.486
Oh, hi.

27:42.649 --> 27:45.163
- Dan.
- Dan, right.

27:45.329 --> 27:49.368
You're Phoebe? Jenny told me.
I hope it's okay to stop by.

27:49.849 --> 27:52.807
Of course. We were just
doing some reading.

27:53.929 --> 27:57.001
Well, I just wanted to give you this
to say thanks.

27:57.209 --> 28:00.838
You know, for talking to Jenny. Or
better yet, for getting her to talk to me.

28:01.009 --> 28:05.958
That's really sweet. And timely too.
But it's not necessary.

28:06.129 --> 28:09.804
Well, to be honest, I was sort of hoping
to get something out of it.

28:09.969 --> 28:12.085
I mean, you know, for Jenny.

28:12.249 --> 28:14.399
Just in case she needs
a woman to talk to again.

28:15.929 --> 28:18.363
Of course. Anytime.
She seems like a great kid.

28:19.329 --> 28:22.241
So did she tell you
what the problem was?

28:23.689 --> 28:26.647
Any idea what size I'm supposed
to get? There's like five.

28:28.369 --> 28:31.247
- Junior is probably a safe bet.
- Right.

28:32.729 --> 28:34.401
Thanks.

28:36.889 --> 28:40.768
- Well, see you around.
- Hopefully.

28:41.889 --> 28:44.005
- Night.
- Night.

28:48.449 --> 28:51.327
No, I understand. Okay, bye.

28:53.729 --> 28:55.879
- Who was that?
- Rob, the banker,

28:56.049 --> 28:59.678
or rather his assistant, telling me
that my loan has been denied.

29:00.049 --> 29:02.927
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

29:03.089 --> 29:05.284
Just wasn't meant to be, I guess.

29:05.449 --> 29:08.202
Really glad I never slept
with him though.

29:08.489 --> 29:09.683
What was I thinking?

29:10.289 --> 29:11.642
About Leo maybe.

29:13.569 --> 29:15.082
Wine?

29:25.809 --> 29:27.481
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:29.129 --> 29:31.165
- You wanna sit down?
- Sure.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.245
They haven't assigned me
a new partner yet...

29:39.409 --> 29:40.478
...since Andy died.

29:41.809 --> 29:43.162
Here.

29:46.129 --> 29:50.361
- I'm sorry I haven't come to see you.
- Yeah, me too.

29:55.769 --> 29:59.478
I'm just glad you're here now, Prue.
I've been worried about you.

30:00.209 --> 30:02.962
- I'm all right.
- Really?

30:03.129 --> 30:05.484
Then how come
you've been avoiding me?

30:05.649 --> 30:08.447
And don't give me that crap about
being too busy, because I know better.

30:08.809 --> 30:11.198
I know what you're
going through, Prue.

30:11.369 --> 30:13.564
I lost him too, you know?

30:14.129 --> 30:15.767
I know.

30:16.169 --> 30:20.128
- It's just been so hard to...
- What?

30:20.569 --> 30:22.844
To face you after what happened.

30:23.009 --> 30:24.522
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

30:24.689 --> 30:25.883
Darryl...

30:27.369 --> 30:31.567
I need to know what Andy told you
about me and my sisters.

30:33.089 --> 30:37.765
- About who we really are.
- Just that you were involved in...

30:38.209 --> 30:40.120
...some of our unsolved cases.

30:41.209 --> 30:43.518
And that you somehow
helped stop the killers.

30:44.409 --> 30:47.003
That's it? Nothing else?

30:47.289 --> 30:51.248
He was my partner, Prue.
I didn't need to know anything else.

30:52.409 --> 30:57.244
So, then, why did you cover for us
when Andy died at the house?

30:58.289 --> 30:59.642
Because he asked me to.

31:02.009 --> 31:04.364
That's why I've been trying
to get ahold of you.

31:04.529 --> 31:05.848
To give you a message from him.

31:06.569 --> 31:08.321
That morning after he saw you,

31:08.769 --> 31:13.081
Andy told me to tell you that if anything
were to happen to him...

31:13.729 --> 31:18.086
...that it wouldn't be your fault.
He didn't want you to blame yourself.

31:18.929 --> 31:20.123
Too late.

31:30.969 --> 31:32.527
You really think that's the window?

31:32.689 --> 31:35.522
You said yourself, the triquetra's
the key, our connection.

31:35.689 --> 31:38.123
And besides, we keep hearing Grams
say "the power of three."

31:38.289 --> 31:40.166
This is what that stands for.

31:40.329 --> 31:42.968
Either that or I just screwed up
this wall for no reason.

31:43.129 --> 31:45.279
Well even if it is the window,
if Prue doesn't show up...

31:45.449 --> 31:46.677
She'll show.

31:47.569 --> 31:49.764
Better late than never, right?

31:49.929 --> 31:52.807
Look, I know that I haven't exactly
been myself lately.

31:52.969 --> 31:56.041
And I know that I'm
going through something.

31:56.209 --> 31:59.519
And that I have some things
to work through.

31:59.689 --> 32:01.520
But I don't want
to let you down because of it.

32:02.449 --> 32:04.883
Right now it's not about me,
it's about us.

32:05.529 --> 32:07.520
Attagirl, Prue.
I knew you'd come around.

32:08.969 --> 32:12.120
- Excuse me?
- Well, I did deep down.

32:12.529 --> 32:14.121
Are you sure you're up for this?

32:20.449 --> 32:21.564
I'm sure.

32:22.769 --> 32:24.122
Okay, so when
the window opens,

32:24.289 --> 32:26.086
Prue, you'll knock Abraxas away
from the book

32:26.249 --> 32:28.046
so Piper and I
can reach in and grab it.

32:28.209 --> 32:29.722
Then, while you're
holding him back...

32:29.889 --> 32:31.845
You'll find a spell
to vanquish him, I got it.

32:32.449 --> 32:35.919
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:36.089 --> 32:38.523
We have to create a circle.

32:39.929 --> 32:43.638
Three, two, one.

32:47.249 --> 32:48.921
Hold on.

32:51.169 --> 32:52.602
Now, Prue, now!

32:54.089 --> 32:56.922
First the book, then you.

32:57.089 --> 33:00.445
- What's the matter with you?
- Prue, use your power.

33:01.609 --> 33:02.678
Prue.

33:32.209 --> 33:34.882
- Prue, what happened up there?
- Nothing.

33:35.049 --> 33:37.802
Yeah, "nothing" is exactly the problem.

33:38.009 --> 33:41.240
I never said that I had the power
to go against him. You did, remember?

33:41.409 --> 33:43.764
- No, the Book of Shadows did.
- Well, maybe it was wrong.

33:43.929 --> 33:45.681
Maybe Abraxas is just too strong.

33:45.849 --> 33:47.919
Maybe. But that doesn't explain
why you hesitated.

33:48.089 --> 33:50.364
- I didn't hesitate.
- The hell you didn't, Prue.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.121
- I saw you.
- We both saw you.

33:52.289 --> 33:55.087
So, what are you saying?
This is my fault, is that it?

33:55.249 --> 33:59.720
- Because I can't defeat Abraxas?
- No, Prue, you can. You just won't.

33:59.889 --> 34:02.323
Okay, something is holding you back.
Something big time.

34:02.489 --> 34:04.878
And instead of facing it,
you are running from it.

34:05.049 --> 34:06.801
- Phoebe...
- But you can't keep running, Prue.

34:07.369 --> 34:09.803
Because you have got to figure out
what your problem is,

34:10.009 --> 34:11.203
otherwise we're all dead.

34:11.688 --> 34:14.157
Yeah, that's right, Phoebe.
It's my responsibility, isn't it?

34:15.529 --> 34:19.237
The oldest sister, always supposed
to be able to figure things out.

34:20.569 --> 34:23.879
Well, if that's the case,
then how come I couldn't save Andy?

34:25.969 --> 34:29.757
If I'm supposed to be so powerful,
how come I couldn't save him?

34:32.809 --> 34:35.641
I mean, my God,
don't you understand?

34:35.809 --> 34:38.527
Andy died because of me.

34:38.768 --> 34:42.887
It doesn't matter what he said,
it was my fault.

34:43.609 --> 34:45.884
How can it be good to be witches

34:46.049 --> 34:48.609
if all it does is
get the people we love killed?

34:53.889 --> 34:55.925
Sweetie.

35:02.649 --> 35:05.163
Prue, it's not your fault.

35:05.329 --> 35:08.480
You tried to keep Andy from
coming here that night, remember?

35:08.689 --> 35:10.327
You tried to warn him,
but he came anyway.

35:10.489 --> 35:11.842
He came because he wanted to.

35:12.049 --> 35:15.007
And there was nothing that
you could have done to stop him, Prue.

35:15.169 --> 35:18.525
He chose to walk through that door
not because of who you are, honey,

35:18.689 --> 35:22.602
- but because of who he was.
- Protector of the innocent, just like us.

35:24.049 --> 35:27.405
I just don't know
if I believe in it anymore.

35:28.769 --> 35:33.524
Honey, we've done a lot of good
as witches too. You know that.

35:34.729 --> 35:38.324
You know, but that doesn't mean that
bad things still aren't gonna happen.

35:39.449 --> 35:42.646
But just because we can't help that,
that doesn't mean that it's our fault.

35:45.449 --> 35:46.438
Or yours.

35:49.609 --> 35:50.644
Come here.

35:55.569 --> 35:59.642
The power of three.

36:01.169 --> 36:04.684
- Okay, did you guys hear that?
- Grams.

36:04.889 --> 36:07.164
The power of three.

36:07.329 --> 36:08.842
How is that possible?

36:09.249 --> 36:12.207
I don't know, but it's gotta be a good
thing if we're all hearing it, right?

36:12.369 --> 36:16.328
- Maybe it means we're connected.
- To be as one.

36:16.489 --> 36:19.401
Maybe that's what the book meant
by the power of one.

36:19.569 --> 36:23.960
- The three of us working as one.
- That's what the triquetra represents.

36:25.209 --> 36:26.608
Almost sunrise.

36:27.369 --> 36:29.280
Do you think you're ready
to try the window again?

36:29.449 --> 36:31.360
Yeah. Yeah, but...

36:31.529 --> 36:33.679
Abraxas will be ready for us here.

36:33.849 --> 36:36.443
We have to take him by surprise,
go where we're the most powerful,

36:36.609 --> 36:38.247
where we're the most connected.

36:44.369 --> 36:48.362
Hear now the words of the witches
The secrets we hid in the night

36:48.529 --> 36:52.966
The oldest of gods are invoked here
The great work of magic is sought

37:01.929 --> 37:05.399
In this night and in this hour
We call upon the ancient power

37:12.929 --> 37:16.080
- Hear now the words of the witches
- The secrets we hid in the night

37:16.249 --> 37:20.003
The oldest of gods are invoked here
The great work of magic is sought

37:27.369 --> 37:30.167
- Prue, Piper.
- Keep chanting.

37:30.329 --> 37:33.924
Hear now the words of the witches
The secrets we hid in the night

37:34.609 --> 37:37.203
What are you doing?
How'd you bring me here?

37:37.649 --> 37:39.844
- The oldest of gods are invoked
- I will destroy you.

37:40.009 --> 37:41.647
Where the great work
of magic is sought

37:41.809 --> 37:45.404
In this night and in the hour
We call upon the ancient power

37:45.569 --> 37:49.926
In this night and in this hour
We call upon the ancient power

37:50.129 --> 37:54.964
In this night and in this hour
We call upon the ancient power

38:01.449 --> 38:03.280
And we didn't even have to get naked.

38:10.409 --> 38:12.445
That's more like it.

38:12.609 --> 38:14.600
I'll feel better
when we erase that window.

38:14.769 --> 38:16.327
I don't want more demons
coming through.

38:16.489 --> 38:18.684
They can't,
it's our window, not theirs.

38:18.849 --> 38:20.965
Still, better safe than sorry.

38:21.169 --> 38:24.844
Especially if we can expect any more
demons like Abraxas coming.

38:25.009 --> 38:26.237
Well, apparently we can.

38:26.409 --> 38:30.038
"Rite of passage.
Fight it with the power of one or else...

38:30.649 --> 38:33.368
...a more powerful evil that awaits
will destroy you."

38:33.529 --> 38:36.202
Wow, I'm glad I didn't finish
reading that yesterday.

38:36.369 --> 38:39.361
I'd have changed my mind about
not wanting to give up our powers.

38:39.529 --> 38:41.042
No, you wouldn't have.

38:41.209 --> 38:43.848
You like being a witch
too much, Phoebe.

38:44.009 --> 38:46.125
And you helped remind me
that I like being one too.

38:48.649 --> 38:52.847
Hey, me three.
Too bad it doesn't pay the bills though.

38:53.609 --> 38:55.327
Did you get it?

38:56.569 --> 38:58.241
Get what?

39:00.049 --> 39:01.767
What's this?

39:04.129 --> 39:06.723
Sixty thousand dollars?

39:07.809 --> 39:09.800
- Where did you get this?
- Home-equity loan.

39:09.969 --> 39:12.244
We took a second out on the house
to help buy your club.

39:12.409 --> 39:14.081
- Actually, our club, technically.
- Right.

39:14.249 --> 39:16.843
As long as you don't mind
being partners with your sisters.

39:18.169 --> 39:19.887
Thank you.

39:20.809 --> 39:24.040
The power of three.

39:26.409 --> 39:27.603
Grams?

39:33.289 --> 39:38.283
Hello, my darlings.
Oh, it's nice to see you.

39:38.489 --> 39:41.003
Or rather, it's nice
being seen by you.

39:41.169 --> 39:43.808
- But...? But how is this...?
- Possible?

39:43.969 --> 39:45.402
All things are possible, my dear,

39:45.569 --> 39:47.924
it's just simply a matter of your
being able to do them.

39:48.089 --> 39:51.126
Wait, so you're the one that keeps
turning the pages in the book?

39:51.289 --> 39:53.439
Just my way of looking after you.

39:53.609 --> 39:55.167
As best I can, anyway.

39:56.089 --> 39:58.808
Don't try to understand this.
You're not ready yet.

39:59.569 --> 40:01.878
But the fact
that you could hear me before,

40:02.049 --> 40:05.519
can see me now,
means that someday you might be.

40:07.169 --> 40:09.046
Be good to each other.

40:11.089 --> 40:12.807
I love you.

40:26.969 --> 40:30.518
Is it just me, or is this attic
getting awfully crowded lately?

40:30.689 --> 40:31.963
Look.
