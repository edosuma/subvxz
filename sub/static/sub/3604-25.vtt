anything, to keep him
in your life?

34:57.346 --> 35:02.181
I can't lose Nathan.
Not like this.
I'm begging you.

35:24.206 --> 35:25.787
(GRUNTING)

35:28.669 --> 35:33.288
You're no longer Sylar.
No longer Gabriel Gray.

35:34.842 --> 35:37.834
That life is over.
Sylar's dead.

35:40.764 --> 35:43.096
(ECHO/NG)
You’re no longer Sylar.

35:43.183 --> 35:46.892
You’re no longer Sylar.
No longer Gabriel Gray.

35:48.355 --> 35:51.097
That life is over.
Sylar is dead.

35:56.405 --> 36:01.490
You're now Nathan Petrelli.

36:01.577 --> 36:06.367
Nathan Petrelli,
son, brother, father.

36:06.457 --> 36:11.372
Senator Nathan Petrelli.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.006
(GASPING)

36:15.090 --> 36:16.830
(GRUNTING)

36:42.534 --> 36:43.865
(EXHALING)

36:45.245 --> 36:46.325
Ma?

36:57.966 --> 37:00.252
MOH/NDER:
We are all connected.

37:00.344 --> 37:02.756
Joined together by
an invisible thread,

37:02.846 --> 37:06.304
infinite in its potential
and fragile in its design.

37:08.310 --> 37:12.349
Yet, while connected,
we are also merely
individuals.

37:12.981 --> 37:16.599
Empty vessels to be filled
with infinite possibilities.

37:16.985 --> 37:19.772
An assortment
of thoughts, beliefs.

37:19.863 --> 37:23.401
A collection of
disjointed memories
and experiences.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.585
It's a new beginning,
Mom.

37:46.849 --> 37:50.717
MOH/NDER: Can I be me
without these?
Can you be you?

38:00.070 --> 38:02.186
I take it the President
agreed to it?

38:04.074 --> 38:07.692
Funding,
resources,
deniability.

38:10.539 --> 38:13.872
I told them
I found just the man
to head up our new...

38:17.421 --> 38:19.286
What were we
gonna call it?

38:20.924 --> 38:22.880
I always liked
"the Company".

38:25.220 --> 38:26.551
(CHUCKLES)

38:34.563 --> 38:35.598
(GROANING)

38:35.689 --> 38:37.429
(BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE)

38:55.083 --> 38:56.914
I can't believe
he's really dead.

38:59.296 --> 39:03.164
He's really dead,
Claire. He really is.

39:04.176 --> 39:07.714
MOH/NDER: And if this
invisible thread that holds
us together were to sever,

39:07.804 --> 39:10.420
to cease, what then?

39:11.225 --> 39:15.264
What would become
of billions of lone,
disconnected souls?

39:16.188 --> 39:19.271
Therein lies the great
quest of our lives.

39:19.358 --> 39:23.647
To find.
To connect.
To hold on.

39:24.154 --> 39:28.193
For when our hearts are pure
and our thoughts in line,

39:28.283 --> 39:33.243
we are all truly one,
capable of repairing
our fragile world

39:33.330 --> 39:37.539
and creating a universe
of infinite possibilities.

40:02.359 --> 40:03.690
(TAP RUNNING)

40:43.108 --> 40:44.393
You're number four.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.198
(DOOR OPENING)

41:04.463 --> 41:10.550
I haven't heard from you
in weeks. I was beginning
to worry. Nathan?

41:14.389 --> 41:15.799
Sorry, Ma.

41:16.391 --> 41:19.133
Just haven't felt
like myself lately.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.058
Don't be ridiculous.

41:21.146 --> 41:25.185
This is a great time
for you, Nathan.
The world's your oyster.

41:25.275 --> 41:28.938
We've put all that
nonsense behind us.
The family's back together.

41:29.029 --> 41:32.442
This is your time.
Now, come on, we're
going to be late for lunch.

41:36.036 --> 41:40.075
Nathan,
have you heard
a word I've said?

41:54.596 --> 41:56.132
(TlCKlNG)

42:02.270 --> 42:04.135
It's just this clock.

42:05.774 --> 42:07.981
lt's running a minute
and a half fast.

42:24.126 --> 42:30.292
(CLEARS THROAT)
So, lunch?
Italian? Chinese?

42:32.592 --> 42:34.128
(CLOCK TlCKlNG)
