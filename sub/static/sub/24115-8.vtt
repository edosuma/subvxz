WEBVTT

00:01.680 --> 00:02.318
If you didn't know

00:02.560 --> 00:04.279
<i>Brainiac corrupted
the Voice of Rao,</i>

00:04.480 --> 00:06.039
<i>then why even
attempt a coup?</i>

00:06.200 --> 00:08.760
<i>Because Daron-Vex
offered to spare your life</i>

00:09.040 --> 00:10.599
<i>in exchange
for my help.</i>

00:10.760 --> 00:12.479
- Stop.
<i>- My new guardians.</i>

00:12.640 --> 00:15.314
The Red Shard,
loyal only to me.

00:15.480 --> 00:16.480
Let me serve you.

00:16.680 --> 00:19.673
Let's put your
newfound loyalty to the test.

00:19.840 --> 00:21.320
I didn't really think
you would do it.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.598
<i>The Oracle foresees
the product of your union.</i>

00:23.880 --> 00:24.880
<i>The child will be male.</i>

00:25.040 --> 00:26.474
When I visited you
in your cell

00:26.640 --> 00:28.216
you said you loved me.
Do you really mean it?

00:28.240 --> 00:30.038
I feared I was
the only one to escape.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.680
<i>You were.
I serve a being</i>

00:31.960 --> 00:33.314
who has power over death.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.834
The Voice
is controlling you!

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
You will die here.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.480
We got to stop her
before she sends

00:39.640 --> 00:41.280
- the signal to Brainiac.
- It's too late.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.280
<i>She's been taken over
by Brainiac's technology.</i>

00:43.320 --> 00:45.551
My mama's not coming home,
is she?

00:45.720 --> 00:46.800
I'm going to look
after you.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.520
She will be given rank
and serve as a novice.

00:49.680 --> 00:50.750
Sevi, what's wrong?

00:50.920 --> 00:52.912
This creature
is deceiving you!

00:53.080 --> 00:53.797
Remove her!

00:53.960 --> 00:56.919
I will lead you
to a place of eternal life.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.390
This son of a bitch
is Superman's greatest enemy.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.711
History tells us Brainiac
takes Kandor City,

01:01.880 --> 01:03.792
causing the planet to explode
in 200 years.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.037
This whole time you knew
and you said nothing!

01:06.200 --> 01:07.759
Seg, you cannot
trust this man!

01:08.000 --> 01:10.117
Find your Zeta-Beam gadget
and never come back!

01:10.280 --> 01:11.920
There's something here
I still need to do.

01:12.120 --> 01:12.951
And what's that?

01:13.120 --> 01:14.520
<i>Kill General Zod
and prevent Seg</i>

01:14.680 --> 01:16.478
<i>from saving Kandor.</i>

01:27.480 --> 01:29.711
My name is Adam Strange,
and I've come here to warn you.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.111
Someone from the future
is coming to destroy Krypton

01:32.320 --> 01:33.736
because where I'm from,
your grandson

01:33.760 --> 01:35.752
becomes the greatest hero
in the universe.

01:35.960 --> 01:39.510
I'm running out of time.

01:40.160 --> 01:40.877
Take this.

01:44.960 --> 01:47.111
You have to save
Superman.

01:48.760 --> 01:49.760
Where did...

01:55.000 --> 01:56.878
Oh, you assholes.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.316
Oh, you tightwad assholes.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.312
<i>Assholes, seriously?</i>

02:01.480 --> 02:04.359
<i>You steal our technology,
disappear with it for years,</i>

02:04.560 --> 02:06.074
<i>and we're the assholes?</i>

02:06.680 --> 02:07.796
First of all...

02:08.479 --> 02:11.075
It's called
a Zeta-Beam device now.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.832
- Came up with that myself.
<i>- No, you didn't.</i>

02:14.000 --> 02:15.070
You're welcome.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.676
And secondly...

02:18.560 --> 02:19.994
I didn't steal it.

02:20.600 --> 02:21.875
I borrowed it.

02:22.240 --> 02:23.720
<i>That device
has the potential</i>

02:23.880 --> 02:26.793
<i>to tear apart
the fabric of space and time,</i>

02:27.000 --> 02:29.993
<i>destroying everything
that ever was and will be.</i>

02:30.160 --> 02:31.992
I was gonna bring it
right back.

02:32.640 --> 02:33.936
But that's the thing
with time travel;

02:33.960 --> 02:36.555
it's difficult to keep
track of time.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.279
<i>That's your explanation?</i>

02:38.440 --> 02:39.760
The long and short of it is,

02:39.920 --> 02:42.151
on account of being
a superhero,

02:42.360 --> 02:43.953
I caught wind
of this shithead alien

02:44.160 --> 02:45.230
trying to change history

02:45.400 --> 02:47.312
and stop Superman
from being born.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.637
<i>- Superman?</i>
- Yeah, him.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.676
You know, and I was in the
middle of warning his pop-pops

02:52.840 --> 02:54.797
when you jackasses
yanked me here.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.994
So if we're done here,

02:58.160 --> 02:59.560
I'd like to get back to work.

02:59.720 --> 03:00.392
Cool?

03:00.560 --> 03:04.315
<i>If what you say is true,
somebody better qualified</i>

03:04.480 --> 03:06.278
<i>will take care of the matter.</i>

03:06.440 --> 03:08.079
Really?

03:08.360 --> 03:10.079
'Cause I didn't happen
upon anyone else,

03:10.240 --> 03:11.594
qualified or not,

03:12.360 --> 03:13.794
traveling through
space and time

03:14.000 --> 03:15.593
to save
the freaking universe.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.951
So you like it or not, Sardath,
I'm the best hope there is.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.515
I was meant to have
that Zeta-Beam device.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.239
<i>I was meant to be a hero.</i>

03:28.400 --> 03:31.040
I was meant to save Superman.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.680
<i>And I will not let anyone</i>

03:34.720 --> 03:36.439
<i>stand in the way
of my destiny.</i>

03:45.520 --> 03:46.880
Shh, shh!

03:47.080 --> 03:49.040
What are you doing?
You scared the life out of me.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.753
I'm sorry, okay?

03:51.240 --> 03:51.957
Why are you still here?

03:52.120 --> 03:53.696
You know why I'm here.
I have to preserve

03:53.720 --> 03:54.756
the timeline Superman...

03:54.960 --> 03:56.696
Please stop, stop, all right,
I'm not interested

03:56.720 --> 03:58.234
in hearing
all about that again.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.280
Whatever you think
your mission was, it is over.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.312
If you only knew him...

04:03.920 --> 04:07.391
Seg's grandson,
th... there's no one like him

04:07.600 --> 04:08.636
in the universe.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.039
He could have been a god.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.998
And he chose humanity.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.273
Guy's the best
of our worlds.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.495
You've said
that speech before,

04:19.519 --> 04:20.519
haven't you?

04:20.760 --> 04:22.433
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.080
Hey, what do you think...

04:24.200 --> 04:26.431
Listen, Adam.
Even you have to understand

04:26.600 --> 04:29.559
that Seg is not going
to sacrifice his world

04:29.760 --> 04:31.752
any more than Superman
would sacrifice yours.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.877
I know. Relax.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.234
I'm not after Seg.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.116
Zod?

04:39.400 --> 04:40.595
Have you met Zod?

04:40.800 --> 04:42.917
He doesn't strike me
as the kind of person

04:43.120 --> 04:44.156
that scares easily.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.595
Well, that's good...

04:46.000 --> 04:47.416
'cause I'm not planning
on scaring him.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.591
Yeah, well, I got that, yeah.
That was my polite way

04:49.800 --> 04:51.678
of saying that if you go near
the gigantic man,

04:51.840 --> 04:53.035
he's gonna kill you
to death.

04:53.200 --> 04:53.951
I'm not gonna talk to you

04:54.120 --> 04:54.837
if you're just gonna be
negative.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.639
You promise?

04:57.240 --> 04:58.240
Fine.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.430
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

05:01.600 --> 05:02.600
Wait.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.280
All right, I'll do you a deal.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.376
Okay, if you can control
your killer instinct,

05:07.400 --> 05:10.154
I will get Seg to come
and meet with you, all right?

05:10.760 --> 05:12.576
I can't promise that he's
gonna change his mind,

05:12.600 --> 05:14.592
but I'm pretty sure
I can convince him

05:14.800 --> 05:16.234
to at least hear you out.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.560
How soon can you
get him here?

05:17.640 --> 05:20.394
How soon do
a wrangled beast's testicles

05:20.560 --> 05:22.392
go up into its cervix
when she's...

05:22.600 --> 05:23.670
- Kem.
- Yep.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.474
We're running low
on supplies.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.879
We're going to
have to make them stretch.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.320
Kem says the streets are
still crawling with Sagitari.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.797
We may have to lie low
for a while longer.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.356
Hello?

06:14.120 --> 06:15.120
Hello?

06:22.880 --> 06:24.837
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.871
Sevi?
Isn't it?

06:30.560 --> 06:31.994
It's me, Kem,
remember?

06:32.160 --> 06:34.516
I was the one who was
looking after Ona.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.033
Yes, I remember.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.634
Where is she?

06:39.440 --> 06:40.954
I know about the Voice.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.231
I know that he is not
the person he says he is,

06:45.400 --> 06:49.440
but I need to know
that Ona is safe.

06:50.040 --> 06:53.317
She's safe.
He likes her.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.680
Well, then, what is going on?
Why are you here?

06:58.640 --> 07:03.760
Anda and I found out
about the Voice's change.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.600
He tried to make us believe
he'd been reborn.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.480
But then I saw
what was happening

07:08.640 --> 07:10.359
in the Genesis Chamber.

07:12.920 --> 07:17.278
<i>And now every night
he plugs himself into it.</i>

07:18.040 --> 07:19.040
<i>When he does...</i>

07:20.600 --> 07:24.435
<i>It's like he's in
some kind of deep trance.</i>

07:25.080 --> 07:29.120
<i>I think... I think
he's sucking its energy dry,</i>

07:29.800 --> 07:31.712
<i>using the embryos
as batteries,</i>

07:31.880 --> 07:35.157
<i>getting stronger by
draining the life from them.</i>

07:53.720 --> 07:55.000
What could Brainiac
possibly want

07:55.040 --> 07:56.520
with the Genesis Chamber?

07:57.440 --> 07:58.440
Everything.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.639
At our essence,
we are all just pure energy.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.593
All those cells,
all those atoms

08:05.760 --> 08:06.876
that make up our body...

08:07.200 --> 08:08.600
When you break it all down,

08:09.080 --> 08:10.434
it's just electricity.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.513
And Brainiac's Sentry
has now tapped into

08:12.720 --> 08:15.440
the greatest source
of electricity in Kandor,

08:15.680 --> 08:16.680
the Genesis Chamber.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.996
But they're not batteries,
they're embryos.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.876
What happens to them?

08:25.640 --> 08:27.233
What happens to our child?

08:28.120 --> 08:29.520
He'll be lost.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.272
Along with the rest
of our civilization.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.754
The only way our species
reproduces now

08:36.200 --> 08:37.919
is via the Genesis Chamber.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.275
Without it...

08:41.200 --> 08:42.395
we have no future.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.280
Your Eminence.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.357
- You look...
- Physical appearance...

09:01.560 --> 09:03.631
is of no concern to me.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.593
But, in the minds
of your people,

09:06.800 --> 09:09.554
I have been reborn.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.876
Indeed.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.394
And you look, um...

09:16.680 --> 09:17.875
Magnificent.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.430
Look at you.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.431
Face to face
with a true superior.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.516
And you still
lust for power.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.479
And you shall have it.

09:42.280 --> 09:46.399
When my work here is complete,
I shall leave Kandor.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.834
And you will again
have the control

09:51.000 --> 09:54.437
you so viciously desire.

10:00.520 --> 10:03.080
<i>Now, according to Sevi,
every time he does</i>

10:03.320 --> 10:05.000
whatever it is
that he does in the Chamber,

10:05.360 --> 10:08.034
the Voice of Rao goes into
some sort of a weird trance.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.634
Well, that's how we stop him.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.320
When he's at
his most vulnerable.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.711
Don't forget he still has
the Red Shard.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.356
We have to get past them
to get to him.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.433
True, but remember
he controls them with his mind.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.096
<i>My guess is,
while he's in that trance,</i>

10:21.120 --> 10:23.430
<i>while he's absorbing energy,</i>

10:24.120 --> 10:26.680
his connection to them
would probably be limited.

10:26.880 --> 10:27.880
So what are you thinking?

10:28.800 --> 10:31.031
We know that Rhom
communicated with Brainiac

10:31.240 --> 10:32.959
<i>using some sort
of neural network.</i>

10:33.560 --> 10:35.576
If we can sever the connection
between the Voice of Rao

10:35.600 --> 10:37.990
and the Red Shard
and then we take him out

10:38.160 --> 10:39.514
while he's in that trance.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.616
But to do that, we need
to find a way into the network.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.359
I know a way in.

10:46.240 --> 10:46.957
<i>Dev.</i>

10:47.160 --> 10:49.072
<i>We can use his connection
to the Voice.</i>

10:50.160 --> 10:51.480
His body is still
in the Outlands.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.553
There's a lot of ifs
in that scenario.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.553
We need backup
as an insurance.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.536
I'll recruit manpower
from Black Zero.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.976
Whoa... whoa, hang on,
we didn't agree to that.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.832
I'm not asking.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.400
Okay.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.800
We'll get Dev.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.876
You meet us here later.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.193
You stay there!

11:25.720 --> 11:27.632
Move to your designated sector.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.040
Even now, your honor
is incorruptible.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.440
If there were
any truth in that,

11:34.480 --> 11:36.472
I wouldn't be
a fugitive.

11:37.520 --> 11:40.354
- Seven, all clear.
- Copy, all clear.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.272
Moving onto Sector 15.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.160
Why are you a fugitive,
Jayna?

11:53.680 --> 11:55.160
I betrayed our oath.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.469
I put my daughter
above honor.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.797
You chose family over duty?

12:03.520 --> 12:04.636
You did the right thing.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.636
A Zod swears an oath
to protect Kandor,

12:08.800 --> 12:10.456
but only if its leaders
are worth protecting.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.756
If they are not,
then they must be replaced

12:12.960 --> 12:14.110
by those who are.

12:14.840 --> 12:17.560
Besides,
if you had chosen differently,

12:18.320 --> 12:19.515
I never would have been born.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.832
Ah, hey, Seg.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.754
Do you mind
if I sit this one out?

12:38.280 --> 12:39.430
Yeah,
what's the matter?

12:40.400 --> 12:41.834
When Rhom died,
I promised Ona

12:42.080 --> 12:43.080
I would look after her.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.913
- Go. Go.
- Thank you.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.434
Do what you can for her.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.320
We'll take Nyssa.

12:49.640 --> 12:50.640
No, we won't.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.176
Her father works
for the Voice of Rao.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.320
What if she
relays our plans?

12:54.400 --> 12:56.153
I'm not having
this argument again.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.709
She can be trusted.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.559
She's also right here.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.754
You know, if I were you,
I'd want to have me close,

13:05.080 --> 13:06.912
keep your eyes on me.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.111
But if you'd rather have me
running around wild and free...

13:15.360 --> 13:16.360
I'm driving.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.160
Sorry.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.240
Brings back memories.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.113
Crammed in a skimmer,

13:39.400 --> 13:42.518
on the way to some crazy
Artisan's Guild party.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.400
Maybe we should go some time?

13:44.560 --> 13:45.994
You know,
after all this is over.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.520
If there even is
an Artisan's Guild

13:47.560 --> 13:48.596
after all this is over.

13:48.840 --> 13:49.956
- Lyta.
- What?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.560
You've seen what
it's like out there.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.955
Guilds don't matter anymore.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.719
Neither do Bindings.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.072
Anyone know how to get
a bit more, um,

14:02.640 --> 14:03.357
air out of these things?

14:03.560 --> 14:05.360
How did you expect
your little coup to end up?

14:06.240 --> 14:08.357
With you and your father
shining atop a hill?

14:08.520 --> 14:10.637
Bringing Kandor
into a new golden age?

14:10.800 --> 14:11.800
No.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.672
I expected it to be
me and Seg.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.916
But things never really
turn out the way you expect,

14:21.080 --> 14:22.080
do they?

14:35.240 --> 14:36.913
This is it.
We're here.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.514
Are you out of your mind?

14:50.640 --> 14:52.597
If Jax-Ur doesn't like
what she has to say,

14:52.800 --> 14:53.517
she's all yours.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.191
Couldn't have asked
for better weather.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.794
We're almost there.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.793
Try to keep up, princess.

15:24.680 --> 15:26.319
I think she means me.

15:26.640 --> 15:27.915
Obviously.

15:37.680 --> 15:38.680
Dev?

15:40.640 --> 15:41.835
Dev!

15:52.600 --> 15:54.193
Don't move
or I'll shoot.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.071
Dev, it's me.
Don't do this.

16:03.840 --> 16:04.910
Help me.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.759
Dev. Dev!

16:08.520 --> 16:09.715
Talk to me!

16:11.880 --> 16:13.360
Is he still alive?

16:14.360 --> 16:16.272
Yes!
But I don't know how long for.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.829
Then we'd better hurry.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.150
Come on, big guy.

17:05.040 --> 17:05.757
What am I looking at?

17:05.960 --> 17:07.679
Jax-Ur,
this is Jayna-Zod, primary...

17:07.800 --> 17:09.519
I know who it is.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.554
She's an even bigger fugitive
than me right now.

17:15.760 --> 17:16.796
Isn't that right?

17:18.440 --> 17:20.477
How does it feel
to spend your whole life

17:20.680 --> 17:22.079
serving the state,
only to have it

17:22.280 --> 17:23.999
chew you up and spit you out?

17:24.880 --> 17:29.193
Pretty shit, actually.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.073
It didn't have to be
that way, you know.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.791
Kandor could have been
a bastion of equality...

17:39.960 --> 17:44.273
no guilds, no Rankless,
a city for the people

17:44.480 --> 17:45.675
by the people.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.274
And soon it will be.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.393
When we begin again
at zero.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.237
That's exactly
why we're here...

17:55.080 --> 17:57.072
Do not speak!

17:58.800 --> 18:01.190
You think I don't know
about your recent behavior?

18:01.880 --> 18:03.917
You can't just come and go
as you please.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.357
Nobody passes through
Black Zero.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.917
You are either in
or you're the enemy.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.549
You have no idea
who the real enemy is.

18:22.720 --> 18:25.394
So let me tell you
about Brainiac.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.680
He's stabilized.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.074
But I had to numb
his motor functions.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.675
So when he wakes up,
he'll only be semi-conscious.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.273
But that's still him, right?

19:03.600 --> 19:04.636
Under all that.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.756
Well, at the moment,
it's impossible to know,

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I'm afraid.

19:15.560 --> 19:18.075
I can't believe this place
actually exists.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.916
All those years my father
spent searching for this...

19:24.080 --> 19:26.311
I started to wonder
if it was even real.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.920
I have a hard time
believing any of this is real.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.635
Not so long ago, I was just
a Rankless street rat,

19:38.040 --> 19:40.032
hustling drunk guildsmen
for money.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.198
Now, I'm...

19:46.240 --> 19:47.515
Trying to save the world.

19:49.520 --> 19:50.520
Yeah.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.671
I'm not doing
that great a job of it so far.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.150
You saved my life,

19:59.760 --> 20:01.717
and if this idea
of yours works...

20:02.400 --> 20:05.040
You may even save the life
of our child.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.636
Hey, hey,
have you seen Ona yet?

20:11.680 --> 20:13.136
- Just... if you see her,
- What the hell...

20:13.160 --> 20:14.256
can you please
just let me know?

20:14.280 --> 20:15.496
I'll be at the bar.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.520
Hey!

20:16.560 --> 20:18.199
- Where's Seg?
- Yeah, not now.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.680
You said that you
would bring Seg.

20:21.760 --> 20:22.920
And all a man has
is his word.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.316
Oh, would you shut up
for once in your life!

20:27.440 --> 20:28.440
What?

20:30.680 --> 20:32.751
Not everything is about
your mission

20:32.960 --> 20:36.954
to save some unborn, imaginary
child from the future.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.879
There are real people,
in real danger

20:39.080 --> 20:40.616
- right now.
- What are you talking about?

20:40.640 --> 20:42.279
I'm talking about Ona,
all right?

20:43.160 --> 20:45.391
She may not have
the blood of Els

20:45.560 --> 20:49.270
running through her veins,
but she means the world to me

20:49.440 --> 20:51.238
and I have to find her,
all right?

20:55.120 --> 20:56.520
All right, let's go.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.280
Come on!

21:00.920 --> 21:03.230
But... I shouted a lot then.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.152
So that's what Val-El
warned us about

21:07.320 --> 21:08.515
all those cycles ago.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.558
Nobody believed him
at the time,

21:10.760 --> 21:12.877
- but he was right...
- I believed him.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.039
Wish I'd listened to him more.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.759
Black Zero will aid you
in your resistance,

21:17.960 --> 21:20.031
but I want something
in return.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.996
Your old master,
Daron-Vex.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.760
The man who stole everything
from me and robbed this city

21:25.800 --> 21:27.234
of everything
it could have been.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.834
If you help us,
Daron-Vex is all yours.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.440
Black Zero is in.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.439
<i>They'll help us
take the Genesis Chamber.</i>

21:51.280 --> 21:52.480
They want something in return.

21:52.760 --> 21:55.070
- What?
<i>- Daron-Vex.</i>

21:57.200 --> 21:57.951
Why him?

21:58.120 --> 21:59.520
<i>Long story for another time.</i>

21:59.680 --> 22:01.433
<i>I assume we have a deal?</i>

22:02.640 --> 22:04.552
It's not
my decision to make.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.240
Do it.

22:11.680 --> 22:12.976
If Black Zero
are going to help us

22:13.000 --> 22:16.357
<i>defeat Brainiac,
then they can have my father.</i>

22:16.960 --> 22:17.632
<i>Good.</i>

22:33.480 --> 22:35.790
Through fire,
we are reborn.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.037
Right there.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.839
Through fire,
we are reborn.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.276
Thank you.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.793
Through fire,
we are reborn.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.559
Through fire, we are reborn.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.235
Uncle Kem!

22:53.920 --> 22:54.956
What's wrong?

22:56.840 --> 22:58.991
I need to talk to you
about the Voice, Ona.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.274
He's not
who you think he is.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.513
Is... this a test?

23:05.680 --> 23:07.990
No. No, sweetheart,
it's not safe here.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.999
Okay? You need to come with us.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.712
It's natural to fear Rao,
but you must love him too.

23:15.440 --> 23:17.636
And in loving him,
I now have back

23:17.800 --> 23:19.553
what I lost with Mother.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.359
Thank you, Uncle Kem.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.096
Taking me to him
was the greatest thing

23:23.120 --> 23:24.120
you could have done.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.389
Psst!

23:25.560 --> 23:27.631
We got to go, right now.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.036
Come on, Kem!

23:34.720 --> 23:36.440
Just know, Ona,
that whatever happens, okay,

23:36.640 --> 23:38.438
you're always welcome back.

23:38.640 --> 23:39.640
Got to go.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.912
What's that?
Up ahead?

23:44.760 --> 23:46.797
All right, you know where
to find me, okay?

23:51.800 --> 23:53.360
You tried.
Can't do much more than that.

23:53.440 --> 23:56.433
Yeah, well, I can rest easy
now knowing that I tried.

23:56.640 --> 23:57.960
You know what,
you should just go.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.536
Seg is not interested in
hearing anything

23:59.560 --> 24:01.760
you've got to say and you're
not gonna get close to Zod,

24:01.800 --> 24:03.096
so you might as well just go
back to where you came from

24:03.120 --> 24:04.793
because you are not
helping here.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.275
But you know what?

24:06.880 --> 24:08.280
Least you tried, huh?

24:17.440 --> 24:20.114
<i>You're not even
going to give me a chance?</i>

24:20.720 --> 24:22.598
Come on, <i>man, I...
you got to at least</i>

24:22.760 --> 24:24.160
<i>let me try.</i>

24:24.720 --> 24:27.997
This... this is Superman
we're talking about.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.759
There's no one like him
in the universe.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.600
<i>Have you ever committed
to anything in your life?</i>

24:33.840 --> 24:35.479
<i>I know you, Adam.</i>

24:35.760 --> 24:36.840
<i>As soon as things get hard,</i>

24:37.000 --> 24:38.878
<i>you'll be out of there
in a flash.</i>

24:39.120 --> 24:40.349
Please, Sardath...

24:41.520 --> 24:43.159
You're right about who I was.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.991
Now give me a chance
to be who I should be.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.435
<i>Alana?</i>

24:48.280 --> 24:51.239
<i>Can he do it?
I don't think so.</i>

24:51.640 --> 24:55.316
<i>But I've never seen him care
about anything so much before.</i>

24:55.800 --> 24:59.589
<i>Certainly not me.
I say we let him try.</i>

25:00.400 --> 25:02.153
Yes!
Thank you.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.114
I promise
I won't let you down.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.272
<i>It's way too late
for that, Adam.</i>

25:07.720 --> 25:08.720
Alana...

25:29.400 --> 25:30.516
Who is this?

25:33.400 --> 25:36.234
I'm your savior.

25:36.400 --> 25:39.234
- Take him away.
- Wait! Wait! Hey!

25:39.440 --> 25:41.440
I know that you're a smart guy
full of smart plans.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.075
But, buddy, you are dumber
than a box of dumb things

25:44.240 --> 25:45.560
if you think
that you can outsmart

25:45.720 --> 25:46.949
that creature you serve!

25:47.160 --> 25:48.160
Stop!

25:49.720 --> 25:50.790
Uncuff him.

25:55.640 --> 25:56.710
And leave.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
That's right.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.275
I know exactly
who you work for.

26:07.480 --> 26:11.110
In fact, I know a lot more
about him than you do.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.096
And if you think
that you're gonna get yourself

26:15.120 --> 26:16.634
out of this mess...

26:16.840 --> 26:19.150
Forget it.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.073
You're in way over your head.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Unless you listen to me.

26:29.360 --> 26:30.400
<i>That thing that used to be</i>

26:30.560 --> 26:31.835
<i>the Voice of Rao is a Sentry,</i>

26:32.800 --> 26:34.917
and however scared you were
of him,

26:35.360 --> 26:37.591
multiply that by a gajillion
and double it,

26:37.840 --> 26:38.637
and now
you're getting close

26:38.800 --> 26:40.678
to how scared you should be
of his boss,

26:41.000 --> 26:42.116
Brainiac.

26:43.880 --> 26:44.552
Now, I'm gonna guess

26:44.720 --> 26:46.518
that he hasn't
filled you in yet

26:46.680 --> 26:50.276
on his intentions,
so allow me.

26:52.160 --> 26:53.640
Look out there.

26:54.840 --> 26:57.196
He's gonna rip
that entire city

26:57.360 --> 26:59.556
out of the ground
and add it to his collection.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.159
Oh, but it gets better.

27:02.400 --> 27:05.472
Brainiac doesn't want
his collection to change, ever.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.915
Each day, same as the last...

27:09.600 --> 27:10.920
for all of eternity.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.474
At least I'd be alive.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.155
Hey.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.720
If that's your idea of life,
have at it.

27:19.000 --> 27:19.717
I'm not gonna get
in your way.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.234
I want to help Brainiac.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.159
Don't want to stop him.

27:23.520 --> 27:24.670
I don't understand.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.758
Then listen,
because I have information.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.520
Information on
the only other people

27:30.560 --> 27:33.120
that really know the truth
of what's going on.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.552
And who
you're really serving.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.576
People who are hell-bent
on stopping Brainiac,

27:39.600 --> 27:43.071
and well, you already know
my stance on that.

27:44.440 --> 27:46.432
I assume you want something

27:48.040 --> 27:52.717
in exchange
for this information.

27:54.320 --> 27:57.791
I want Seg-El delivered
to me safe and sound first.

27:59.440 --> 28:00.896
I need to ensure
that he's out of Kandor

28:00.920 --> 28:02.991
- before it's taken.
- Seg-El?

28:03.520 --> 28:05.432
What does he
have to do with this?

28:05.680 --> 28:08.195
Well, Daron,
I'd tell you,

28:08.560 --> 28:09.676
but I don't want to.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.440
It's "Dare-on."

28:22.440 --> 28:25.274
Dev.
Don't be scared.

28:26.080 --> 28:26.877
You're not paralyzed.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.077
We just need to keep you
in this state to make sure

28:29.280 --> 28:31.556
the Voice doesn't
try and control you again.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.269
Blink if you understand.

28:37.800 --> 28:38.836
Good.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.912
We might have a way
to free you.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.272
But the procedure...

28:47.880 --> 28:49.553
it might kill you, Dev.

28:51.480 --> 28:54.075
But if it doesn't,
you will be free.

28:54.280 --> 28:55.576
And you will have given us
the key

28:55.600 --> 28:58.559
to stopping the Voice
and saving Kandor.

28:58.960 --> 29:00.896
If you don't want to do it,
we can find another way,

29:00.920 --> 29:02.877
but we are running
out of time.

29:09.680 --> 29:13.560
Blink once for yes.
Twice for no.

29:23.040 --> 29:24.713
Thank you, Dev.

29:27.480 --> 29:29.517
Do you always drink
before battle?

29:31.760 --> 29:33.160
Only on Krypton.

29:35.960 --> 29:37.997
Back on Earth you can't even
get a buzz going.

29:38.320 --> 29:41.313
But, there are other benefits.

29:43.040 --> 29:46.750
Kal-El, the Superman
you keep hearing about.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.636
He was no different
to any other Kryptonian.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.896
He just happened
to make it off our planet

29:51.920 --> 29:53.240
before it was destroyed.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.550
Then landed on a planet
with a yellow sun.

29:56.840 --> 29:59.480
That's what makes him super.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.435
Radiation.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.393
That and dumb luck.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.954
But if Krypton
never was destroyed,

30:10.760 --> 30:13.070
we all could have
the powers he has.

30:13.280 --> 30:16.990
Imagine the good
that could do the universe.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.999
How did you survive
Krypton's destruction?

30:28.840 --> 30:31.150
I wasn't on Krypton
when it exploded.

30:32.600 --> 30:33.875
Where were you?

30:37.120 --> 30:38.600
The Phantom Zone.

30:39.520 --> 30:40.520
It's...

30:41.520 --> 30:46.117
sort of an extra dimension
or... abyss.

30:46.920 --> 30:49.594
Defying the laws
of space or time.

30:49.920 --> 30:52.480
Turns out it's perfect
for housing criminals.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.757
You were imprisoned?

30:55.480 --> 30:56.914
What did you do?

30:59.520 --> 31:00.840
I attempted a coup.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.912
Guess it runs in the family.

31:06.040 --> 31:08.032
I grew up in Kryptonopolis,
and the council there

31:08.200 --> 31:12.240
was as inept
as yours here in Kandor.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.536
There was one person
on the council

31:15.560 --> 31:17.995
that I truly respected.

31:18.840 --> 31:21.992
Of course, he was the one
who foiled my plans

31:22.840 --> 31:24.752
and sent me away.

31:26.760 --> 31:30.037
His name was Jor-El.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.837
- Seg, what's your status?
<i>- We got Dev.</i>

31:38.040 --> 31:39.336
<i>So now Val's hacking
into the network</i>

31:39.360 --> 31:40.840
<i>between the Voice
and the Red Shard.</i>

31:41.200 --> 31:42.316
I'm on my way.

31:42.520 --> 31:43.616
We'll get the team together
and meet you

31:43.640 --> 31:45.438
at the Genesis Chamber.

31:47.720 --> 31:51.430
May Rao's grace
be your shield.

31:57.800 --> 32:00.076
<i>They're being led
by Jayna-Zod,</i>

32:00.240 --> 32:02.040
but we have the forces ready
to snuff them out

32:02.120 --> 32:03.520
once and for all.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.191
Say the word
and it will be done.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.111
Your Eminence,
my information is reliable.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.955
I assure you,
we can crush this rebellion

32:13.120 --> 32:14.520
before it even begins.

32:15.280 --> 32:16.760
Are you even listening?

32:16.920 --> 32:19.310
What was that?

32:19.480 --> 32:21.949
- Move, move, move!
- Go! Go! Go!

32:22.400 --> 32:25.040
Take cover!
Take cover! Get down!

32:25.400 --> 32:26.675
You two go on ahead.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.872
We'll keep them busy down here,
give you a chance

32:29.040 --> 32:30.235
to get to the Voice!

32:31.080 --> 32:33.197
Why are you still here?
Go!

32:48.120 --> 32:49.315
I'm tired of running.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.477
- What's happening?
- His body is going into shock!

33:04.680 --> 33:05.896
Hacking into this
neural network

33:05.920 --> 33:07.593
is not as easy as it sounds.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.056
What, you mean
you can't do it?

33:09.080 --> 33:10.196
I didn't say that.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.350
Your Eminence.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.434
You need to stop this
immediately.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.000
Seems like your plan
hasn't worked.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.429
Please, listen to me!

33:19.640 --> 33:20.856
The connection
between the Voice

33:20.880 --> 33:22.837
and his guards
is still active.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.160
Give 'em time.

33:24.560 --> 33:26.233
Hurry, Val,
they're all counting on you!

33:26.600 --> 33:28.557
Thank you,
I am very well aware of that.

33:28.760 --> 33:29.976
Good,
because whatever it takes,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.037
you need to find a way!
Understood?

33:32.200 --> 33:34.476
I'm an El.
We always find a way.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.789
They've had long enough.
We need to do this now.

33:37.960 --> 33:40.555
I'll concentrate on the guards;
you take the Voice.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.550
Told you.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.073
I've been waiting
14 cycles for that.

34:42.960 --> 34:43.960
Looking for this?

34:48.880 --> 34:50.074
You're free, Dev.

34:52.840 --> 34:56.277
The Voice of Rao,
is he dead?

34:56.440 --> 34:57.760
We don't know yet,

34:57.920 --> 34:59.673
but what we do know
is your bravery

34:59.840 --> 35:03.311
has helped save the lives
of Kandor's next generation.

35:06.880 --> 35:08.030
Thank you, Dev.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.115
Hello, Father.

35:29.680 --> 35:30.955
How's your nose?

35:32.200 --> 35:33.520
Seen better days.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.074
Haven't we all?

35:41.560 --> 35:43.392
You going to do it
this time?

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Kill you?

35:48.520 --> 35:49.795
Of course not.

35:51.280 --> 35:53.670
You haven't outlived
your usefulness.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.035
Then what?

35:59.920 --> 36:01.149
Why are you here?

36:07.480 --> 36:09.153
I came to tell you

36:09.640 --> 36:11.233
that I forgive you.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.438
For what you did to...

36:15.000 --> 36:19.040
for what you tried to do to me.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.397
You're a survivor, Father.

36:25.200 --> 36:27.157
It's all you've ever known.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.837
All you ever taught me.

36:31.480 --> 36:34.040
But I want to do more
than survive.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.872
I want to be more
than just a survivor.

36:39.040 --> 36:43.159
So did I.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.029
Good-bye, Father.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.352
Good-bye, Nyssa.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.911
Cheers.

37:25.320 --> 37:26.390
There he is,

37:27.400 --> 37:30.313
my old friend Daron-Vex.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.557
We have a lot
of catching up to do.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.080
Take him.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.320
We're not done yet.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.553
The Voice of Rao
still hasn't been found.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.176
That's because
he's in a thousand pieces

37:46.200 --> 37:47.680
at the bottom
of the Genesis Chamber.

37:47.920 --> 37:48.751
Nobody could survive that.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.479
The deal was
the Voice of Rao

37:50.600 --> 37:52.239
in exchange for Daron.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.352
I only see one of them here.

37:54.840 --> 37:58.436
Fine. You have Black Zero
until the body is found.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.079
Then you and I
need to have a talk.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.960
About who's going to fill
this sudden power vacuum

38:04.600 --> 38:05.776
now that the mask
and the magistrate

38:05.800 --> 38:07.154
are out of business.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.670
I look forward to it.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.476
<i>Areas 11 and 28, clear.</i>

38:20.680 --> 38:21.875
<i>All clear here.</i>

38:23.440 --> 38:26.035
Just a kid here,
no Sagitari.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.279
Report back to Jax
with the status.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.520
Copy that.

38:40.720 --> 38:42.279
Do not be alarmed.

38:42.880 --> 38:44.837
I am in no pain...

38:46.320 --> 38:49.154
as I am not of this body.

38:52.520 --> 38:55.160
I wear it merely
for appearances.

38:55.440 --> 38:56.440
Will you be okay?

38:57.880 --> 38:58.996
Of course.

39:00.160 --> 39:04.040
This...
is only temporary.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.718
Everything is,

39:08.880 --> 39:10.633
except me.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.555
Shh, shh, shh.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.871
There is nothing
to be afraid of, Ona.

39:17.080 --> 39:21.438
Through fire,
we are reborn.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.199
Come on, where the hell
are they?

39:30.720 --> 39:32.837
- ...respond immediately.
- Move!

39:33.000 --> 39:34.912
Units 2 and 3,
do you copy?

39:35.320 --> 39:36.640
That can't be good.

39:40.520 --> 39:43.672
- Through fire, we are reborn.
- Ona.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.560
- Ona, wait!
- Through fire, we are reborn.

39:45.640 --> 39:50.078
Through fire, we are reborn.

39:58.440 --> 40:00.557
- Want a drink?
- No.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.432
I need to speak to you
about Dru-Zod.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.594
He survived
Krypton's destruction

40:07.800 --> 40:11.237
because he wasn't actually
on Krypton when it happened.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.839
He was in
an off-planet prison

40:14.000 --> 40:16.390
for trying to overthrow
the government.

40:16.600 --> 40:20.116
Apparently, it was an El
that put him there.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.957
I don't think he's come back
to save Krypton, Seg.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.400
I think he's come back
to rule it.

40:30.520 --> 40:31.520
Ona.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.598
Ona!

40:36.680 --> 40:40.560
Oh, I'm so glad
that you decided to come back.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.040
What's wrong?

40:46.520 --> 40:48.830
Through fire, we are reborn.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.913
No.

42:51.400 --> 42:52.400
What the...
