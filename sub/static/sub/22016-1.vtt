00:03.171 --> 00:04.004
Kids, breakfast! Luke,
why don't you have some fruit?

00:04.038 --> 00:05.073
Nah, I'm good.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.809
Fine.
I'll have some.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.578
Phil!
Slow down!

00:10.611 --> 00:11.879
I'm sorry, Claire.

00:11.912 --> 00:14.014
Unlike at home,
I'm the captain here.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.020
Damn it, Phil,
knock it off!

00:20.054 --> 00:20.954
Copy that.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.324
You know,
I like having these.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.592
We should get some
for the house.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.827
No, you're not going to ask me
"what time is lunch?"

00:26.860 --> 00:28.429
every day
through a talkie-walkie.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.932
Cam, we need to
talk about this.

00:31.965 --> 00:33.734
We -- We have
these lamps at home.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.069
Okay, we have
boat lamps.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.537
Cameron: I know.
It's so validating.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.939
It's like that time
we saw our can opener

00:38.972 --> 00:41.209
in that dog-food
commercial.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.376
We rented a houseboat.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.078
My dad wanted us to
take a big lake trip

00:44.112 --> 00:46.514
so we could see the first
total eclipse in 99 years.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.581
You know,
growing up on a farm,

00:47.615 --> 00:49.417
I always fantasized
about lake life.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.119
Yeah. You know,
anyone can go to the lake.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.053
Only the elite
can sleep on it.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.888
My parents used to
take Claire and me

00:54.922 --> 00:56.290
every summer
when we were kids.

00:56.324 --> 00:58.792
Oh, I just never dreamed I would
marry into a lake family.

00:58.826 --> 00:59.693
Mm.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.629
We have this pillow,
too.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.264
I'm beginning to
question our taste.

01:03.297 --> 01:06.500
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
We have great taste.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.436
What's all this, then?

01:08.469 --> 01:10.371
The doctor said
absolutely no sun

01:10.404 --> 01:11.705
while I'm on these
antibiotics.

01:11.739 --> 01:12.773
And what would happen?

01:12.806 --> 01:14.275
Because if it's anything
short of death,

01:14.308 --> 01:16.244
I-I think you
should risk it.

01:29.323 --> 01:32.126
Morning.
Good Morning! Who's hungry?

01:32.160 --> 01:35.329
Manny, how do you
take your eggs?
Like God made 'em.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.965
Mm!

01:37.998 --> 01:39.633
Manny,
what are you doing?

01:39.667 --> 01:40.801
This isn't Manny.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.002
It's Manuel.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.937
He's trying to reinvent
himself for college.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.939
He's going for a strong,
silent type.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.509
Ah.
Hey, don't try
to define me, man.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.844
"Manuel's" gonna
last five minutes.
Hey.

01:50.878 --> 01:51.745
Ah!

01:51.779 --> 01:52.780
It is what
it is, man.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.482
All right, everybody,
listen up.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.916
The eclipse is happening
at exactly --
We know, we know,
we know.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.451
We know exactly when
it's happening, Dad.
Yeah.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.519
Uh-huh.
You told us.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.787
Then just make sure
you get back here

01:59.820 --> 02:01.789
-so we can watch it together.
-No problem.

02:01.822 --> 02:04.024
Hey, Dad, you know Hugh Duncan
from Just Closets?

02:04.057 --> 02:05.459
That pretentious
half-Brit

02:05.493 --> 02:07.161
that refers to closets
as "wardrobes"?

02:07.195 --> 02:08.128
He died.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.930
Son of a gun.
I always liked him.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.165
Yeah, something
like that happens

02:11.199 --> 02:13.601
makes you realize how
precious life is, huh?

02:13.634 --> 02:15.469
Morning, fam!

02:15.503 --> 02:16.970
Somebody kill me.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.639
Ben and I have been dating
a few months now,

02:18.672 --> 02:20.140
and things have
been going so well,

02:20.174 --> 02:22.176
I decided to invite him
on our family vacation.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.377
We knew it would
take some --

02:23.411 --> 02:25.479
I could listen to
you talk forever.

02:25.513 --> 02:26.514
Aww!

02:26.547 --> 02:28.015
We knew it would take
some convincing.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.284
It's bad enough that
I have to see Ben's stupid face

02:30.318 --> 02:31.385
at the office every day.

02:31.419 --> 02:32.653
You want to bring
him on our trip?

02:32.686 --> 02:33.821
Just because
he bugs you

02:33.854 --> 02:35.656
doesn't mean this will
ruin your vacation.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.891
He's a huge reason
why I need a vacation!

02:39.893 --> 02:41.895
I mean, I can
see both sides.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.365
Ohhh.
Does anyone know

02:44.398 --> 02:46.133
if these pancakes
are gluten-free?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.801
I can't!
Why?
What's wrong?

02:47.835 --> 02:50.671
I can't listen to you talk
about gluten anymore!

02:50.704 --> 02:52.973
Or mouth guards
or airborne allergens

02:53.006 --> 02:55.409
or any of your other
weird afflictions!

02:55.443 --> 02:57.878
Has anyone seen
my big hat?
No.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.847
You know what? Traveling
together was a big mistake.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.182
Let's just...
do our own thing.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.684
Uh...

03:03.717 --> 03:04.718
a-all right.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.320
Well, uh...

03:06.354 --> 03:07.488
What are you guys
up to today?

03:07.521 --> 03:09.022
-Water skiing.
-Homework.
-Boat stuff.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.724
Ay, no.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.725
What am I
looking at?

03:11.759 --> 03:13.227
Okay, relax.
You all act like

03:13.261 --> 03:14.862
you've never seen
a caftan before.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.531
I just needed full breathable
coverage today.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.434
The fact that it looks so great
is just a bonus.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.370
What's that?
"Groovy Guppies."

03:22.403 --> 03:24.272
I'm gonna binge-watch
the last season.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.506
I never heard of it.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.675
Get out of whatever your
mommy's got you doing.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.177
Your life is about
to change.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.680
I'm going down to the little
store to buy some sunglasses.

03:32.713 --> 03:33.847
I'm thinking
something fun.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.350
All right. Well, don't
get anything too garish.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.888
Hey, sexy!
Party on the island!

03:40.921 --> 03:42.723
Come by!

03:42.756 --> 03:44.224
Yum!

03:44.258 --> 03:45.393
-What are you doing?
-What was that?

03:45.426 --> 03:46.860
-That was a boy!
-That was a girl!

03:46.894 --> 03:48.128
-What are you talking about?!
-What are you talking about?!

03:48.161 --> 03:49.463
Whatever that was,

03:49.497 --> 03:52.032
we're going to his/her party
before Ben finds me.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.268
Team Dunphy, D to the five.
You guys ready to go?

03:54.302 --> 03:55.436
Yeah, what do you
feel like doing?

03:55.469 --> 03:56.470
We were thinking
maybe a hike?

03:56.504 --> 03:57.938
A little flora,
fauna, and --

03:57.971 --> 03:59.273
Forget it.
We're going to a party.

03:59.307 --> 04:00.641
But if you're looking
for something fun,

04:00.674 --> 04:01.875
the rental guy gave us
this pamphlet.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.444
Thanks. We already
got one, but --

04:03.477 --> 04:05.212
Oh.
Yours is different.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.880
Parasailing, wakeboarding...

04:06.914 --> 04:07.948
jetpacking?

04:07.981 --> 04:10.318
Ours has
sunrise chair yoga,

04:10.351 --> 04:12.453
watercolors at
water's edge,

04:12.486 --> 04:15.055
and something called...
cloud study?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.657
Yeah, they gave that one
to Grandpa, too.

04:16.690 --> 04:17.725
We got
the old people one?

04:17.758 --> 04:18.626
No!

04:18.659 --> 04:19.827
Why would they do that?

04:19.860 --> 04:20.994
Looks like you guys

04:21.028 --> 04:24.097
got some fluffy ones
out today.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.499
That one looks
like a bunny.

04:25.533 --> 04:26.367
Oh, yeah.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.905
Ah. It feels like
we're in St. Tropez.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.674
I don't trust lakes.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.676
Where I come from,
this is where we dump

04:35.709 --> 04:37.311
drugs and dead bodies.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.446
You know what?

04:38.479 --> 04:40.748
I am gonna give you
a little boat tour

04:40.781 --> 04:43.283
and show you this lake
in all of its glory,

04:43.317 --> 04:45.285
but you need to
keep an open mind.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.654
Okay, fine.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.623
Let's ride around
the liquid graveyard.

04:51.725 --> 04:55.329
Mama, riding on small boats
makes my tummy hurt.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.997
Can I stay with Lily?

04:57.030 --> 04:58.065
Sí, papi.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.807
It was Scotty --
this local lake kid

05:06.840 --> 05:08.876
I met on vacation when I was 13.

05:08.909 --> 05:12.312
I had a huge crush on him,
so on the last day,

05:12.346 --> 05:15.716
I decided to take a chance
and I kissed him.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.451
It was my first time
ever kissing a boy,

05:17.485 --> 05:21.121
so when he pulled away and said
that he wasn't "into this,"

05:21.154 --> 05:22.456
I was humiliated.

05:22.490 --> 05:25.325
I mean, I'd obviously misread
signals. He was straight.

05:25.359 --> 05:28.328
It was five years before I ever
made a move on a guy again.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.963
And even then, I wouldn't dare

05:29.997 --> 05:33.033
unless he was basically
floating across the room.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.835
Which is why
I ended up with --

05:34.868 --> 05:36.003
Well, you know.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.641
Finding everything okay,
buddy?

05:40.674 --> 05:41.675
Yeah.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.711
Just, uh, first time
here, so, uh...

05:43.744 --> 05:45.078
You look familiar.
Do I know you?

05:45.112 --> 05:46.313
No! Nah, nah, nah.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.349
Just picking up a few, uh,
lake essentials.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.585
Okay.

05:51.619 --> 05:52.420
Whoa.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.654
Are you robbing me?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.756
God, no. No, um...

05:55.789 --> 05:56.757
You know what?

05:56.790 --> 05:58.058
Good.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.496
I started reading the tributes
to Hugh Duncan on Facebook.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.864
There were a ton of them.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.767
People going on and on about
what a great guy he was.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.236
"Grandpa Hugh once gave me
a vintage stethoscope,

06:09.269 --> 06:12.840
which inspired me to become
a pediatric oncologist."

06:12.873 --> 06:15.909
Made me wonder what people will
say about me when I'm gone.

06:15.943 --> 06:19.447
Honey, I want you to
have my telescope.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.282
May it inspire you
to love science.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.551
I already love science.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.753
This feels like
a real turning point.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.621
You know, it's a story
you'll want to tell people.

06:27.655 --> 06:30.458
"He always told me
to reach for the stars."

06:30.491 --> 06:31.425
Thanks?

06:31.459 --> 06:33.126
Ben: Alex!
Where are you?

06:33.160 --> 06:34.962
Ohh! It's Ben.
Tell him you haven't seen me.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.129
I don't want
to talk to him.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.266
Alex?

06:39.299 --> 06:40.868
We'll only be gone
for a couple hours.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.436
Joe and Lily
will be fine.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.437
Oh, wait. Look.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.972
There's that nice
lake butler

06:45.005 --> 06:46.974
that helped me earlier
with my bags.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.709
Señor. Señor.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.278
Could you take care of our kids
for a couple of hours?

06:51.311 --> 06:54.147
I will pay you double what you
make working for the lake.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.248
Seriously?

06:55.282 --> 06:56.249
You know me.

06:56.283 --> 06:57.618
We rode to
the airport together.

06:57.651 --> 06:58.952
Can you watch our kids
or not?

06:58.986 --> 07:00.921
Actually,
I'm kind of, uh --

07:00.954 --> 07:01.989
Alex?

07:06.293 --> 07:08.095
Any food allergies
I should know about?

07:09.697 --> 07:11.832
This is fun --
just the two of us.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.602
Yeah. And the walking sticks
are a real game changer.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.670
Hold the phone.
We've hit a vista.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.171
Ohh.

07:18.205 --> 07:21.675
Looks like you're not the only
mountain chickadee around here.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.776
You spotted one?

07:22.810 --> 07:25.245
When it's your turn,
note her black bib.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.313
Okay.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.618
Oh, my God.
Isn't she majestic?

07:30.651 --> 07:31.752
Phil, we're them.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.121
We're the cover of
the old people's pamphlet.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.290
Well, that's a fine
"How do ya do."

07:37.324 --> 07:39.126
Oh, even this guy
wouldn't say that!

07:39.159 --> 07:40.127
You're right!

07:40.160 --> 07:41.795
What is wrong with us?

07:41.829 --> 07:43.130
Man: Whoo!

07:43.163 --> 07:44.832
Look!
Wa-hoo!

07:44.865 --> 07:46.600
That's what we
should be doing!

07:46.634 --> 07:49.469
We just need to find ways to
stay young and adventurous.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.470
I'm with you, honey.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.640
Let's go!
Yes! Yes!

07:52.673 --> 07:54.508
I don't need
you anymore!

07:57.745 --> 07:59.713
Boy, you really get
used to those things.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.620
It's not that I want
to be mean to Ben.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.689
He can just be
so annoying sometimes.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.658
And I know
nobody's perfect,

08:10.691 --> 08:14.127
but does that mean I have
to ignore all of his flaws?

08:14.161 --> 08:16.129
Or is the issue me?

08:16.163 --> 08:19.299
A-Am I just looking for
something that doesn't exist?

08:19.332 --> 08:22.636
Am I even capable of loving
someone unconditionally?

08:22.670 --> 08:25.105
We get it.
You have a boyfriend.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.809
Hey, there's that
guy's jet ski.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.210
That girl's jet ski.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.613
Whatever it was, it was into me,
and I'm kissing it.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.515
Keep this dry
for me, Pretty.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.524
We walked around
that whole island.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.259
No hot boys,
girls -- nothing.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.394
Just a bunch of birds.

08:47.427 --> 08:48.896
And not even hot birds.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.399
Hey, where's our boat?

08:54.067 --> 08:55.703
It's gone.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.104
And so are
their jet skis.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.272
They lured us out here
and stole our stuff.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.609
You idiot. You thought
that girl really liked you.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.947
"Hugh was the world's
greatest father-in-law.

09:06.980 --> 09:10.150
He was always there for me,
ready to lend a helping hand."

09:11.619 --> 09:12.686
What are you
doing, Phil?

09:12.720 --> 09:13.887
Oh, I'm just waiting
out here

09:13.921 --> 09:15.589
while Claire changes
for our cliff dive.

09:15.623 --> 09:18.291
Looks like you could use some
help with that pesky sunscreen.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.526
Really?
Yeah.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.461
Thanks!

09:21.494 --> 09:23.130
There you go.

09:24.497 --> 09:25.465
It tickles!

09:25.498 --> 09:27.300
Listen, Phil --
I know, I know.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.969
This never happened.
Oh, it happened.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.138
Never forget how these strong
father-in-law hands

09:31.171 --> 09:32.405
gave you pleasure.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.310
"My dad, Hugh, once gave me
the best advice --

09:37.344 --> 09:39.780
have the courage to
choose your own path,

09:39.813 --> 09:42.249
not the path others
expect of you.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.484
Those words changed
my life forever."

09:46.620 --> 09:47.921
What's going on, son?

09:47.955 --> 09:50.758
I know there's a story there,
and I really care.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.059
It's nothing.
Bup, bup, bup.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.393
Walls down, please.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.828
Ugh. Okay, fine.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.496
Um, it's really
embarrassing.

09:56.529 --> 09:59.232
Uh, I ran into this guy
who works at the bait shop.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.233
Is that a gay bar?

10:00.267 --> 10:02.435
No, an actual bait shop.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.171
And I came on to him
years ago.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.806
It turns out
he was straight.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.075
And I'm -- I'm still
traumatized by it.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.177
Let me give you
some advice.

10:10.210 --> 10:13.246
Run toward embarrassment,
not away from it.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.614
You got that?

10:14.648 --> 10:15.683
Wait. What?

10:15.716 --> 10:16.917
Go talk to the guy.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.619
Run toward embarrassment,
not away from it,

10:19.653 --> 10:21.154
and you take away
its power.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.522
That's actually not
the worst advice.

10:22.555 --> 10:23.623
It's great advice.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.958
In fact, you should
write it down.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.359
It feels quotable.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.294
You know what?

10:27.327 --> 10:28.628
I am.
I'm going back there.

10:28.662 --> 10:29.663
You got this,
Mitchell.

10:29.697 --> 10:30.998
Just think of it
as one more time

10:31.031 --> 10:33.466
when your dad helped you out
with all this gay business.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.634
Yeah, okay.

10:36.303 --> 10:40.473
Oh, Gloria, have you ever seen
such pristine blue water?

10:40.507 --> 10:42.142
Is that
a floating duffel bag?

10:42.175 --> 10:44.344
No, that's just a buoy.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.345
A boy?!

10:45.378 --> 10:46.646
No, a buoy. A --

10:47.681 --> 10:49.717
Oh, my caftan's
stuck in the --

10:49.750 --> 10:51.051
Aah!
Aah!

10:51.084 --> 10:52.319
The sun!

10:52.352 --> 10:54.521
Aaaaaaaaah!

10:58.391 --> 10:59.626
Almost done.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.294
Just a few more
puffs, okay?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.296
Can't we just watch
"Groovy Guppies"?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.532
Trust me, this will
be way more fun.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.047
Don't worry.
He'll be fine.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.353
Go faster!

11:26.386 --> 11:28.188
It's not a violin.
You're trying to start a fire.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.489
Hey, chill, man!

11:29.522 --> 11:30.824
That's never
gonna work.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.826
We need a better way to let
someone know we're out here.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.594
Anyone have a mirror?

11:34.627 --> 11:37.697
Good idea. We can reflect
the sun onto a passing plane.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.266
No, I just have a feeling
that my hair

11:39.299 --> 11:41.034
looks really good
right now.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.102
Manny: Ow!

11:42.135 --> 11:44.004
I got a splinter
in my pinkie!

11:44.037 --> 11:45.773
I think we have
a time of death on Manuel.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.074
Shut up!
It's your fault

11:47.107 --> 11:49.009
for making me rub those sticks
together so fast.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.443
My fault?
We wouldn't even be out here

11:50.477 --> 11:52.012
if it weren't
for these two lizard brains

11:52.045 --> 11:53.546
not being able
to keep it in their pants.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.515
You're just jealous because
we don't hate ourselves

11:55.548 --> 11:57.050
for being attracted
to other people.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.019
Please! I'm not accepting
a psych evaluation

11:59.052 --> 12:00.553
from somebody who
texted me for help

12:00.587 --> 12:02.255
getting out of
the bathroom this morning.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.623
Boat locks
are different!

12:03.656 --> 12:05.092
He's right,
you know.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.960
This is your first time
bringing a boy on vacation,

12:06.994 --> 12:09.129
and the second he sat down
with the whole family,

12:09.162 --> 12:11.464
things started to get a
little too real for you.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.466
So you started
to pick Ben apart

12:13.500 --> 12:15.335
so you could justify
pushing him away.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.405
I don't think
I do that.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.407
Do I do that?

12:20.440 --> 12:21.641
I do do that.

12:21.674 --> 12:24.611
When you think about it,
I'm in a similar situation.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.113
College is getting
a little real,

12:26.146 --> 12:29.149
and maybe I'm nervous about
a whole new group of people

12:29.182 --> 12:32.085
rejecting me,
so I hid Manny away.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.821
After all...

12:33.854 --> 12:35.889
can't hurt
a man they'll never meet.

12:35.923 --> 12:36.723
Mm!

12:36.756 --> 12:38.125
Ugh.
I miss Manuel.

12:38.158 --> 12:38.992
Yeah.

12:40.861 --> 12:41.895
Oh, hi.
Uh-oh.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.230
Here to rob me again?

12:43.263 --> 12:45.298
Sorry about that.
I-I didn't mean to scare you.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.800
Oh, no.
You didn't scare me at all.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.568
As a matter of fact,
I'm the one robbing you.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.303
Back in town, these worms
are 5 cents each.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.172
Ah.
So, um, listen.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.506
We -- We actually
do know each other.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.476
Uh, Mitchell Pritchett.
Summer of '89?

12:56.509 --> 12:57.978
I let you have
my Nintendo Game Boy?

12:58.011 --> 12:59.913
Mitchy Pritchy!
Of course!

12:59.947 --> 13:01.348
You were mad about
that Game Boy

13:01.381 --> 13:02.649
'cause your dad
got you that

13:02.682 --> 13:04.184
instead of, like,
some Cher album.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.785
"If I Could
Turn Back Time."

13:05.819 --> 13:07.254
Which brings me
to why I'm here.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.356
Um, I don't know if
you remember this,

13:09.389 --> 13:11.624
but I tried to kiss you
once, and I've --

13:11.658 --> 13:13.293
I've just always -- I've felt
really terrible about it.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.461
And I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.696
Oh, yeah.
No, I barely remember that.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.932
We had a great summer.
Don't think twice about it.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.934
Oh! That is --
that is such a relief.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.470
Remember we stole my dad's truck
and took it to the casino?

13:23.503 --> 13:24.671
Right.
I was trying
to cheer you up

13:24.704 --> 13:26.773
because that bully kept
pushing you in the lake.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.308
Claire. Yeah.
No, we're cool now.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.443
Um, so, listen,
good to see you.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.945
Great to see you.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.147
Oh, and, hey, listen. Thank you
so much for understanding.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.149
A lot of straight guys
wouldn't have been so nice.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.985
Straight? I'm not straight.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.352
I'm sorry.
What?

13:39.386 --> 13:41.321
I'm gayer than
three crawdaddies in a bucket.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.489
Were you guys
looking for bait?

13:42.522 --> 13:43.991
I just got in some
California Short Worms

13:44.024 --> 13:46.326
that are definitely not
regular worms cut in half.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.198
Claire: Oh!

13:51.231 --> 13:52.365
You ready to do this?

13:52.399 --> 13:53.733
So ready!

13:53.766 --> 13:55.135
Jumping off this cliff
represents

13:55.168 --> 13:56.803
jumping into our future
as adventurers.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.805
Okay.
Count of three.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.341
One, two, three!

14:02.209 --> 14:04.912
Phiiiilllll!

14:08.848 --> 14:10.017
Honey...

14:10.050 --> 14:11.584
what happened?
I'm so sorry.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.819
I bailed at
the last second.
Uh-huh.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.854
But I'm ready now.
I promise.
All right.

14:14.888 --> 14:18.158
Ready?
One, two, three!

14:18.191 --> 14:19.392
Come o--

14:22.629 --> 14:24.231
Oh. Hey.
There you are.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.832
Uh-huh.
Um, I feel like you

14:25.865 --> 14:27.767
jumped on "two."
Oh!

14:27.800 --> 14:31.604
Honey, jumping -- it's fun.
It's really fun.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.540
But the point was
to do it with you.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.774
So if that's gonna
be a problem --

14:34.807 --> 14:36.509
No, I-I definitely
want to do it.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.011
It's just that I'm having

14:38.045 --> 14:39.779
a hard time getting
my legs to cooperate.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.848
Okay.
You're gonna
have to push me.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.116
Are you sure?
Yes.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.118
Just one hard push,
and I'm good.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.386
Okay.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.456
Here...

14:49.489 --> 14:51.391
we...

14:51.424 --> 14:52.859
go --

14:52.892 --> 14:53.893
Oh, come o--

15:02.635 --> 15:03.971
Stop rocking this thing
so much.

15:04.004 --> 15:04.938
I am getting seasick.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.040
Well, you poor thing.
Maybe if you had --

15:07.074 --> 15:09.409
Uh-oh! Cramp, cramp, cramp,
cramp, cramp, cramp!

15:09.442 --> 15:11.644
Calf's cramping up!
Calf's cramping up!

15:11.678 --> 15:13.213
Gloria, I need you
to rub my calf!

15:13.246 --> 15:15.415
No! I'm not
gonna touch that water!

15:15.448 --> 15:16.449
Gloria, I'm in
so much pain!

15:16.483 --> 15:17.884
You got to put
a little pressure on it!

15:17.917 --> 15:19.286
Put a little
pressure on my calf!

15:19.319 --> 15:20.753
Okay, fine!

15:24.257 --> 15:26.593
Aaaaaah!

15:26.626 --> 15:28.328
I'm in the lake!

15:28.361 --> 15:29.896
I'm in the lake!

15:29.929 --> 15:32.665
Ay, no! Ay! Ay!

15:32.699 --> 15:34.934
Oh! What do you know?
My cramp's gone.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.505
Hi, again.
Quick question.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.772
No refunds
on the bait.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.308
They were alive
when you bought them.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.909
Oh. Hey, Mitchy.
Sorry.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.346
Just curious -- um,
how long after we hung out

15:46.379 --> 15:48.081
did you realize that
you were gay?

15:48.115 --> 15:50.350
Oh, no, it was --
it was years before that.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.618
Oh. Okay.
So -- So, back then,

15:51.651 --> 15:53.520
when you said that you --
you weren't "into this,"

15:53.553 --> 15:54.854
you meant that you
weren't into me.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.656
Well...
Because I must have been
the only gay kid

15:56.689 --> 15:58.358
around for miles,
right?
Oh, I don't --

15:58.391 --> 16:00.193
Yeah, I mean,
technically, yeah.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.494
Let me get this right.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.530
You're in the middle of nowhere,
with no other options,

16:03.563 --> 16:06.666
at an age where a boy
gets excited by the wind,

16:06.699 --> 16:08.701
and you looked at me,
and you said, "Ooh, pass."

16:08.735 --> 16:10.137
W-- I --

16:10.170 --> 16:11.371
I'm sorry.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.505
I feel bad.

16:12.539 --> 16:13.973
It was 30 years ago,
though.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.376
You want some...
free bait?

16:16.409 --> 16:17.444
Have a lure?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.346
Apparently,
I don't have allure.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.449
Okay, Gloria,
there's a store.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.617
Go in there. Get me something
to cover me up with -- anything.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.319
But if there is a color choice,
avoid yellow and green.

16:26.353 --> 16:27.487
It washes me out.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.222
Oh, yeah, Cam,
I would love to help you --

16:29.256 --> 16:31.991
the same way you helped me
fall into that filthy lake!

16:32.025 --> 16:35.695
Hey, kids! Watch out
for the naked man!

16:35.728 --> 16:36.796
What?
Good luck.

16:36.829 --> 16:37.797
Gloria?

16:37.830 --> 16:38.865
Gloria!

16:42.402 --> 16:43.736
Claire!

16:43.770 --> 16:45.004
Claire!!

16:45.038 --> 16:46.639
Look!

16:46.673 --> 16:48.408
I got a jetpack!

16:48.441 --> 16:49.576
Ohhh!

16:52.245 --> 16:55.682
I don't want to be the one
to hold you back!

16:55.715 --> 16:57.384
I didn't think it'd be
this hard to contr--

16:57.417 --> 16:58.985
Aaaaah!

16:59.018 --> 17:00.553
Phil!

17:00.587 --> 17:02.389
Oh, my God!

17:02.422 --> 17:04.524
Look!
We're not boring!

17:04.557 --> 17:06.193
We're still adventurous!

17:06.226 --> 17:07.427
I can see that!

17:07.460 --> 17:09.396
I'm so proud of you!

17:09.429 --> 17:10.930
I love you so much!

17:13.900 --> 17:14.701
Claire?

17:14.734 --> 17:16.203
Oh, no, honey.
Don't worry.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.904
I-It's just the eclipse.

17:17.937 --> 17:20.740
I can't tell if
I'm headed up or down!

17:20.773 --> 17:22.309
Aaaaaaaah!

17:26.879 --> 17:29.249
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.721
Where is everybody?

17:34.754 --> 17:36.623
Ah, who needs them?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.758
This is a pretty special
moment, huh, Joey?

17:40.427 --> 17:42.395
Eh, you're never gonna
remember any of this.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.233
If you don't mind,

17:46.266 --> 17:47.867
I -- I do want to go outside
and see the eclipse.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.802
Oh, I'm not done.
Just -- Just so you know,

17:49.836 --> 17:52.705
plenty of people find me
very attractive, okay,

17:52.739 --> 17:56.209
including my amazing husband,
who is no slouch himself.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.711
Hi.
Do you sell muumuus?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.747
And I am gonna go
find him right now.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.654
Hey, what's that?
Oh, my God! It's Ben!

18:07.687 --> 18:09.322
He came to rescue me!

18:09.356 --> 18:11.158
I was out there
all alone.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.092
And then it
got really dark.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.727
And I'm so thirsty.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.296
Ew! I got mud on me.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.066
I'm so sorry
I lashed out at you.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.002
I think I do it when I start
getting close to someone.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.004
But I want to be
close to you.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.073
I want that, too.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.108
Come on. We can use
this as an oar.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.913
Oh, there's not enough
room for all of us.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.782
Well, the two of us can
stay while you --

18:35.815 --> 18:37.717
I'll come back for you!

18:39.219 --> 18:40.453
All right.

18:43.723 --> 18:47.527
Well, well, well.
Look who finally showed up.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.830
Maybe we can try this again
in another 99 years.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.465
Actually, there'll be
another total eclipse again

18:52.499 --> 18:54.634
in the next seven years.
No one wants your stupid
science, Alex!

18:55.502 --> 18:57.036
I asked for one thing --

18:57.069 --> 18:59.806
to share a memory with all of us
with me at the center of it!

18:59.839 --> 19:01.140
And by the way,

19:01.174 --> 19:05.044
I had to pay surge boat rates
because of eclipse fever!

19:05.077 --> 19:06.379
Claire:
This is an all-time rant.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.815
Oh, yeah, top three.
It goes Christmas '84,

19:08.848 --> 19:10.217
that wedding
where he ordered the pork

19:10.250 --> 19:11.484
but they gave him
the chicken instead,

19:11.518 --> 19:12.552
and eclipse weekend.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.820
The only reason
I went to that wedding

19:13.853 --> 19:15.288
was because of
the damn pork!

19:15.322 --> 19:17.390
Is this gonna be the only thing
you guys remember about me?!

19:17.424 --> 19:19.292
Does this have something to
do with Hugh Duncan dying

19:19.326 --> 19:20.693
and all those
Facebook tributes?

19:20.727 --> 19:23.730
No!!
Wait, w-were you trying to
manufacture nice moments

19:23.763 --> 19:25.898
so that we'll say good things
about you when you're gone?

19:25.932 --> 19:27.567
Wait. Is that why you
gave me your telescope?

19:27.600 --> 19:30.403
And the -- the sunscreen?
That wasn't real?

19:30.437 --> 19:31.638
I don't want
to talk about this!

19:31.671 --> 19:33.540
Jay, where
are you going?!

19:33.573 --> 19:36.376
Oh, for God's sakes!
Dad! Come back!

19:37.877 --> 19:39.045
Grandpa, stop!

19:39.078 --> 19:40.980
We have tons of great
memories of you!

19:41.013 --> 19:42.349
You're just saying that!

19:42.382 --> 19:44.150
Someone think
of an example!

19:44.183 --> 19:45.818
-Uh...
-Um...

19:45.852 --> 19:47.754
You used to bring
me back magnets

19:47.787 --> 19:50.056
every time you went away
on a business trip!

19:50.089 --> 19:51.391
It was so thoughtful!

19:51.424 --> 19:54.026
Yeah, when you found out
I was into almond milk,

19:54.060 --> 19:57.264
you went to Costco and got me
that giant thing of almond milk!

19:57.297 --> 19:59.732
Well, you like it,
and it doesn't go bad.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.001
When my mom died,
you texted me every day

20:02.034 --> 20:04.203
for a week
to check on me!

20:04.237 --> 20:06.172
You always save me
the red gummy bears

20:06.205 --> 20:07.274
because they're
my favorite!

20:07.307 --> 20:08.875
Gloria:
And me the green ones!

20:08.908 --> 20:11.278
Also, the nice life
and stuff!

20:11.311 --> 20:13.112
And -- And --
And you're really good

20:13.145 --> 20:16.449
at saving old pictures of me
and Mitchell as kids!

20:16.483 --> 20:18.050
Getting a little general.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.720
"Run toward embarrassment,
not away from it,

20:20.753 --> 20:22.221
and you take away
its power"!

20:22.255 --> 20:24.090
I'm always gonna
remember that!

20:26.092 --> 20:27.427
Good enough.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.930
"Run toward
embarrassment"?

20:30.963 --> 20:32.131
What does that
even mean?

20:32.164 --> 20:33.733
I don't know.
He needs this.

20:38.505 --> 20:40.206
Why would you push
me in like that?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.874
Oh, relax,
everybody laughed.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.876
* Turn around

20:43.910 --> 20:46.979
* Every now and then,
I get a little bit lonely *

20:47.013 --> 20:49.081
* And you're never
comin' 'round *

20:49.115 --> 20:50.750
* Turn around
Me.

20:50.783 --> 20:53.653
* Every now and then,
I get a little bit tired *

20:53.686 --> 20:56.055
* Of listening to the sound
of my tears *

20:56.088 --> 20:59.592
* Turn around,
bright eyes *

21:00.760 --> 21:01.928
Who?
Dad.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.896
Come on, Jay.
Everybody will remember it!

21:03.930 --> 21:06.433
-That's extortion.
-Come on.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.435
* Every now and then,
I fall apart *

21:08.468 --> 21:09.436
There it is.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.405
* And I need you now
tonight *

21:12.439 --> 21:14.774
* And I need you
more than ever *

21:14.807 --> 21:16.075
Is this even a song?

21:16.108 --> 21:18.978
* Once upon a time,
I was falling in love *

21:19.011 --> 21:21.914
* But now I'm only
falling apart *

21:21.948 --> 21:23.750
* There's nothing I can do

21:23.783 --> 21:27.654
* A total eclipse
of the heart *

21:29.288 --> 21:30.623
Phil: Hey. Where's Ben?
Alex: Uh-oh.
