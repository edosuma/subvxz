WEBVTT

00:10.923 --> 00:12.838
This woman is my sister.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.840
You followed me all the way
to goddamn Europe?

00:14.884 --> 00:16.755
I am here on business, Patricia.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.801
But you don't
know who I am?Jason Jason Ripper.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.803
Would you fuck your mum
to save her life?

00:20.846 --> 00:23.327
MARTHA: He didn't want
to leave Esme alone.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.245
But I persuaded him.

00:28.289 --> 00:29.594
This is on me.

00:29.638 --> 00:30.639
This is my fault.

00:30.682 --> 00:31.988
RIPPER:
Esme was killed

00:32.032 --> 00:33.642
to make you suffer.

00:33.685 --> 00:34.904
Her killer is

00:34.947 --> 00:37.428
watching you squirm.You know who killed her?

00:37.472 --> 00:40.127
You'll give me the name if
I do something for you first.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.303
SYKES:
I used to work for you.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.087
You're Lord Harwood.

00:44.131 --> 00:47.395
Lord James Harwood.

00:47.438 --> 00:49.092
I'm not Harwood!Oh! All right.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.616
JULIAN: The struggle continues,
but it's not going well.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.792
We're losing the battle
on the streets.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.664
We want a truce,
and I asked them to arrange

00:55.707 --> 00:58.623
a meeting between myself and
Frances Gaunt to discuss terms.

00:58.667 --> 00:59.668
Then we'll kill her.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.844
I got the distinct
sense they know.

01:01.887 --> 01:03.454
They know I'm CIA.

01:03.498 --> 01:04.716
I have a job for you,

01:04.760 --> 01:06.022
if you're interested.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.763
You have to succeed tonight

01:07.806 --> 01:09.069
if you want
that name.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.599
Good night, ladies.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.430
Come here.

01:22.473 --> 01:24.649
Should I wake me dad?No.

01:27.957 --> 01:29.045
PRIME MINISTER:
This will sink

01:29.089 --> 01:30.394
the bloody No-Name League
for good.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.092
The widow Mrs. Thwaite
has been appointed

01:32.135 --> 01:33.963
pro tem leader,
pending elections.

01:34.006 --> 01:36.183
England will soon
be yours, my girl.

01:49.370 --> 01:52.547
NEWS READER: Civil disturbances
and street violence

01:52.590 --> 01:55.637
between left- and right-wing
extremist groups

01:55.680 --> 01:59.293
have erupted across the nation
following the unexplained death

01:59.336 --> 02:01.251
of Julian Thwaite,

02:01.295 --> 02:04.646
leader of the so-called
No-Name League.

02:04.689 --> 02:07.431
The prime minister has issued
a statement.

02:07.475 --> 02:10.739
We are facing the grave danger

02:10.782 --> 02:12.175
of outright anarchy...

02:12.219 --> 02:14.438
T-Turn it off.
Turn it off!

02:14.482 --> 02:15.831
Turn it off, Lulu.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.702
Yes, mistress.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.791
Law and order are the walls...

02:19.835 --> 02:21.053
Are you all right, Ginger?

02:21.097 --> 02:22.838
...upon which the root
of democracy sits.

02:22.881 --> 02:24.274
I know that man.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.146
PEGGY: Yeah, that was
the prime minister.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.191
That's the man that hurt me.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.758
BET: That's right.
It is.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.194
You're remembering.

02:31.238 --> 02:32.848
He's remembering.

02:32.891 --> 02:37.157
Well done.
Keep thinking.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.594
Do you remember your name?

02:39.637 --> 02:42.379
J-James.

02:42.423 --> 02:44.294
Bingo!

02:44.338 --> 02:45.904
That's right, love.
You're James.

02:45.948 --> 02:49.125
James what?

02:49.169 --> 02:51.867
James...

02:51.910 --> 02:54.565
H-H-Harwood.

02:54.609 --> 02:57.220
James Harwood.

03:00.223 --> 03:04.053
My name is James Harwood.

03:05.359 --> 03:08.188
Lord James Harwood.

03:08.231 --> 03:09.711
Hooray!

03:09.754 --> 03:12.583
The leader of the Raven Society.

03:12.627 --> 03:17.240
That man... tortured me.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.677
He destroyed my life.

03:21.462 --> 03:22.680
H-He has to die.

03:24.987 --> 03:28.686
He has to die.

04:21.304 --> 04:23.132
Bloody idiots.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.829
You mark my words,
this carries on,

04:24.873 --> 04:26.918
we'll be swimming
in rivers of blood.

04:26.962 --> 04:29.443
We'll be paddling
fucking canoes in it.

04:29.486 --> 04:32.054
Assassinations, riots.

04:32.097 --> 04:33.795
You'd think we was French.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.846
You all right, Daveboy?
Been in the wars again?

04:41.890 --> 04:44.196
It's-- It's just a scratch, pal.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.242
Oh.

04:49.724 --> 04:52.335
Yes, sir,
what can I get you?

04:52.379 --> 04:55.077
I'm good, thank you.

05:00.604 --> 05:03.694
I've been looking for you
for two days.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.696
I was poorly.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.350
What happened?

05:07.394 --> 05:10.658
Well... what can I say?

05:10.701 --> 05:13.182
I cocked up, eh?

05:13.225 --> 05:16.011
One of those things.
Sorry.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.882
I'm sorry,
"one of those things"?

05:17.926 --> 05:19.449
The wrong damn target was hit.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.233
Fair play.

05:21.277 --> 05:24.541
But that wasn't me.
That was the other fella.

05:24.585 --> 05:29.024
Ah, yes, the other fella.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.767
The one who helped you escape.
It was...

05:32.810 --> 05:36.640
It was very kind of him.

05:36.684 --> 05:39.513
Who was that?

05:39.556 --> 05:42.559
Couldn't tell you.
He was wearing a mask.

05:42.603 --> 05:47.390
Ah, a mystery man, eh?

05:47.434 --> 05:50.045
Who was he working for?

05:50.088 --> 05:53.265
And how the hell
would I know that?

05:55.442 --> 05:59.924
Hmm. I'll have to explain
this mess to my bosses.

05:59.968 --> 06:02.274
They'll need answers.

06:02.318 --> 06:03.972
Any input?

06:04.015 --> 06:05.713
No.

06:05.756 --> 06:06.714
Here's my theory.

06:06.757 --> 06:09.238
You were the assassin,

06:09.281 --> 06:10.761
but it wasn't Gaunt
or the Raven Society

06:10.805 --> 06:12.328
who asked you to kill Thwaite.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.418
Nor was it the government.
They have plenty of killers.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.506
Why come to you?

06:18.116 --> 06:21.032
Then a name sprang to mind.

06:21.076 --> 06:23.600
I hear you've become close
friends with John Ripper.

06:23.644 --> 06:26.342
You've been spying on me.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.954
That's not a denial.
I'll take it as a yes.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.392
It was you who killed Thwaite,
and Ripper who sent you.

06:32.435 --> 06:34.785
Take it how you like.
Leave me alone.

06:37.788 --> 06:42.445
Now, why on Earth...
would Ripper want to kill

06:42.489 --> 06:45.187
the leader
of the No-Name League?

06:45.230 --> 06:47.189
What's in it for him?

06:47.232 --> 06:49.017
It's puzzling.

06:49.060 --> 06:52.673
I suspect he's working
for somebody else.

06:52.716 --> 06:57.329
Don't suppose he told you,
did he, who he's working for?

06:57.373 --> 07:00.681
You ask a lot of
questions, Mr. Wayne.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.204
Are you sure you want
the answers?

07:02.247 --> 07:07.122
Well... that sounded vaguely
like a threat.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.340
I don't make threats.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.430
Why tell people what
you're going to do?

07:10.473 --> 07:12.475
You may have started
a civil war.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.521
Haven't you done
enough harm already?

07:14.564 --> 07:16.958
I don't want you to get hurt.

07:17.001 --> 07:19.177
I can't say the same
for my friends.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.876
Some of them aren't
as gentle as I am.

07:21.919 --> 07:25.183
You're not scaring me, Alfred.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.142
I have friends like that, too.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.154
Cheeky... fuck.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.026
What friends has he got?

07:42.070 --> 07:44.159
He means the CIA.

07:46.204 --> 07:47.510
Get to fuck.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.730
He's only posing as
a No-Name League activist.

07:49.773 --> 07:52.036
He's an American agent. CIA.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.995
Evening, Daveboy.All right.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.605
Alfie.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.433
Same again?

07:57.477 --> 07:58.478
Yeah.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.218
And a bag of crisps.

08:02.394 --> 08:03.483
Bastard.

08:06.311 --> 08:07.878
What-- What's got to her?

08:07.922 --> 08:11.012
What's wrong with
asking for crisps?

08:11.055 --> 08:13.710
What?

08:13.754 --> 08:16.452
Oh.

08:27.071 --> 08:30.901
Want some?
There's plenty.

08:30.945 --> 08:33.469
No, thanks.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.950
I did my part.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.734
You promised me a name.

08:37.778 --> 08:40.868
I did.

08:40.911 --> 08:44.088
If there was an angel
on your shoulder, she'd say,

08:44.132 --> 08:48.179
"Turn away now, Alfie.
Walk away.

08:48.223 --> 08:51.879
Serenity is the best revenge."

08:51.922 --> 08:54.142
She'd be wrong.

08:54.185 --> 08:56.536
So long as you're sure.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.673
Go and see Baroness Ortsey,
at Bethlehem Royal Hospital.

09:03.717 --> 09:06.458
She'll tell you who killed Esme.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.548
Who's Baroness Ortsey?

09:09.940 --> 09:12.160
The baroness is...

09:12.203 --> 09:15.206
more of a "what" than a "who."

09:34.748 --> 09:37.751
I'm here to see Baroness Ortsey.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.317
Fill out an application.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.145
We'll process your request
in due course

09:41.189 --> 09:42.843
and contact you by post.

09:42.886 --> 09:45.454
I haven't got time for that.
I need to see her now.

09:45.497 --> 09:47.064
That won't be possible, sir.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.373
John Ripper sent me.

10:25.494 --> 10:28.845
Good morning, ma'am.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.589
ORTSEY:
Good morning, Matron.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.027
Good morning, young man.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.855
What's your name?

10:38.899 --> 10:40.204
Alfred Pennyworth.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.684
Say it again.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.033
Alfred Pennyworth.

10:43.077 --> 10:47.255
I like your voice,
Alfred Pennyworth.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.605
How can I help you, Alfred?

10:49.649 --> 10:52.434
Why are you in there?
What did you do?

10:52.477 --> 10:56.960
Oh, horrors,
my dear, horrors.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.832
Don't ask again
or I'll tell you.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.311
You'll wish you didn't know.

11:00.355 --> 11:03.140
Why are you here, Alfred?

11:03.184 --> 11:07.275
John Ripper said you can tell me
who killed my fiancée.

11:07.318 --> 11:10.017
But now you're here,
you have doubts.

11:10.060 --> 11:15.152
Well, I was expecting,
you know, an informer.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.937
You're a fortune teller,
aren't you?

11:16.980 --> 11:18.765
Oh, dear me, no.

11:18.808 --> 11:22.856
I'm a witch.
Different.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.685
I don't believe in witches and
ghosts and all that malarkey.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.122
The truth doesn't care
what you believe.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.558
All right, then,

11:29.601 --> 11:31.255
who killed my fiancée?

11:31.299 --> 11:33.214
Tell me, and I'll cross
your palm with silver.

11:33.257 --> 11:36.086
Sarcasm is a very
ugly form of wit.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.306
And I don't know who
killed your fiancée.

11:38.349 --> 11:40.264
So you're wasting my time then.

11:40.308 --> 11:41.788
Actually, you're wasting mine.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.615
Sorry to bother you.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.879
Who is the other woman?

11:52.189 --> 11:54.714
What do you mean by that?ORTSEY: What I say.

11:54.757 --> 11:59.762
I... get a very strong feeling
there's another woman involved

11:59.806 --> 12:01.677
in the murder
of your fiancée.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.724
Who is she?

12:04.767 --> 12:06.464
There is no other woman.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.292
Then I'm mistaken.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.686
Never mind.

12:13.776 --> 12:17.867
You're very good...
at standing still and silent.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.608
That's a wonderful gift.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.523
Go on.

12:21.566 --> 12:23.394
Go on?

12:23.438 --> 12:24.787
Do your hocus-pocus.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.399
No, I won't.

12:28.443 --> 12:29.879
Why not?

12:29.923 --> 12:32.795
You're rude and cynical,
and I don't want to help you.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.797
I apologize.Not good enough.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.494
Well, what do you
want me to say?

12:36.538 --> 12:40.803
Say, "Please, Madame, help me.
I'll do anything."

12:44.372 --> 12:46.635
Please, Madame, help me.
I'll do anything.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.898
Very well. I'll help you,

12:48.942 --> 12:51.640
but first,
you must prove your faith in me.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.729
How?

12:53.773 --> 12:56.036
When the moon is full,

12:56.079 --> 12:58.168
bring me a red rose

12:58.212 --> 13:01.128
and the left hand
of a murderer.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.783
And I'll tell you
all you need to know.

13:04.827 --> 13:06.786
Give over.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.875
How about some toad's eyeballs?

13:08.918 --> 13:12.095
You're a nutcase, you
are, or a bloody liar.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.793
Either way, I'm a mug.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.666
You'll be back, Alfred.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.104
You'll be back.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.768
Good to see you, Thomas.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.249
Good to see you, sir.

13:35.292 --> 13:37.817
The folks back home are eager
to hear what went wrong

13:37.860 --> 13:39.862
with the Gaunt operation
from your perspective.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.386
Why it wasn't
Gaunt assassinated?

13:42.430 --> 13:45.215
Well, my man cocked it up.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.565
One of those things.

13:47.609 --> 13:51.569
I was... very upset at first,

13:51.613 --> 13:53.876
but then I analyzed
the situation, and I find...

13:53.920 --> 13:56.879
I can't blame myself.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.316
Not entirely.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.189
In fact,
I rather blame the Company.

14:02.232 --> 14:05.192
I should have been informed
about all of your plans.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.847
Should you indeed? Explain.

14:07.890 --> 14:12.242
I asked myself, who ordered
the death of Julian Thwaite?

14:12.286 --> 14:14.854
Not Gaunt and the Raven Society.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.507
Not Downing Street
or the queen.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.900
No?

14:17.944 --> 14:20.250
The Thwaites were a team.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.949
Why kill one of them
when you should kill both?

14:22.992 --> 14:25.777
Who benefits
from such an odd arrangement?

14:25.821 --> 14:28.868
Only one person--
Undine Thwaite.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.087
She becomes undisputed leader
of the League.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.872
Thin reasoning.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.438
Oh, I have other evidence.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.701
I'm just giving you
the bones here.

14:36.745 --> 14:39.530
If she did kill her husband,
she's one of two things.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.228
A reckless fool,

14:41.271 --> 14:43.970
or a woman with powerful friends
backing her play.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.667
From which I conclude

14:45.710 --> 14:47.364
Undine Thwaite
and the U.S. government

14:47.408 --> 14:49.932
conspired together
to kill Julian Thwaite.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.978
Interesting idea.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.283
That's not a denial.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.547
I can tell you...

14:56.591 --> 14:59.202
that we have an asset very close
to Undine Thwaite.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.638
We control her.

15:00.682 --> 15:01.901
Your asset's John Ripper.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.425
I can't confirm ordeny that.

15:04.468 --> 15:07.689
Now you get to
clean up the mess.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.691
The U.S. congressional elections
are coming up.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.214
America needs
at least six months

15:11.258 --> 15:12.955
of peace and quiet in Europe.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.915
So we need a truce between
the Ravens and the No-Names.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.702
That's an executive
operational memo.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.530
In the next few days,

15:22.573 --> 15:24.880
Undine Thwaite will arrange
another meeting with Gaunt.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.056
Our asset will make
sure you'll be there

15:27.100 --> 15:28.971
as one of Thwaite's team.

15:29.015 --> 15:32.018
This time, she'll offer Gaunt
a sincere and reasonable truce.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.716
If Gaunt accepts, well and good.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.631
If she refuses, she has to go.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.459
Last time we spoke,
Gaunt was dead at any price.

15:38.502 --> 15:39.895
She's scared now.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.244
Nearly dying will do that.

15:41.288 --> 15:42.680
She'll be more flexible.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.552
If Gaunt plays ball, she lives.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.815
If not, you take her out.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.688
Me?

15:50.732 --> 15:52.690
Personally?

15:52.734 --> 15:54.692
Are you ready?

15:56.390 --> 15:58.261
Yes.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.655
I am.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.705
You tricked me!

16:07.749 --> 16:09.707
How's that?

16:09.751 --> 16:11.448
The old lady's a nutter.

16:11.492 --> 16:12.928
Thinks she's a
bloody witch.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.277
And you don't believe her?

16:14.321 --> 16:15.713
'Course I bloody don't.

16:15.757 --> 16:17.193
There's no such
thing as witches.

16:17.237 --> 16:18.978
Sincerely, Alfie.

16:19.021 --> 16:23.765
I know the baroness can help you if
you give her a chance.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.375
If you have a little faith.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.943
You tricked me,
Mr. Ripper.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.641
Suppose I did.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.904
What then?

16:35.907 --> 16:38.823
Well, then, I'm very
disappointed in you.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.872
That's life.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.917
I'm an undertaker.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.398
Nobody I meet is happy.

16:55.144 --> 16:58.017
It's so good to see you
out and about again, Alfie.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.409
Isn't it, Mr. P?

16:59.453 --> 17:01.107
Yes, it is.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.500
Only...

17:03.544 --> 17:06.068
you seem so angry.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.070
Are you angry?

17:08.114 --> 17:10.116
Me? Angry? No.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.900
I'm your mother, Alfie.

17:11.943 --> 17:13.945
I know your moods.

17:15.251 --> 17:18.037
You've every...
every right to be upset

17:18.080 --> 17:20.343
after what you've been through,
son.

17:20.387 --> 17:23.477
So long as you don't...
go back to lolling in bed.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.174
What are you trying to say?

17:25.218 --> 17:27.350
We're worried, Alfie.

17:27.394 --> 17:30.136
All this running about
with John Ripper.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.963
I don't like
to speak ill of anyone,

17:32.007 --> 17:33.530
but he is not a good man.

17:33.574 --> 17:36.577
I'm sorry, but he's not. He's...

17:36.620 --> 17:39.275
Well, I wouldn't like
to say what he is.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.060
He's a bad influence.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.974
Oh, don't worry, Mum.

17:43.018 --> 17:46.152
I know what he is, and he's
got no influence over me.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.502
I'm done with him,
and all that dark shit.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.460
Got to look on
the bright side.

17:50.504 --> 17:53.028
Well, I'm very glad to hear it.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.815
You've no need
of friends like that, son.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.169
You've got family
that loves you.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.475
MARY:
That's right.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.521
You remember that.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.612
I will.

18:19.315 --> 18:22.101
I'm sorry
I've been such a burden since...

18:23.102 --> 18:25.104
...since Esme died.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.498
I'm gonna change.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.022
I'm gonna get me old job back,
start again.

18:31.066 --> 18:33.068
Put the past behind me.

18:47.256 --> 18:49.432
Yes?

18:49.476 --> 18:52.218
Got it.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.089
On my way.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.769
God.

19:21.812 --> 19:23.814
Christ.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.254
Hi, little brother.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.647
What are you doing here?

19:32.258 --> 19:35.043
Is that a real gun?

19:35.086 --> 19:37.132
Patricia, what are
you doing here?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.873
I need money,
and you have some.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.440
Why have you got a gun?

19:40.483 --> 19:42.833
Why are you
back in London?The air is damp.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.531
Good for the complexion.Oh.

19:44.574 --> 19:47.229
Why the fuck do you always stay
in these ghastly hotel rooms?

19:47.273 --> 19:49.623
Why don't you buy a place?This is not convenient.

19:49.666 --> 19:52.191
I have an urgent
business meeting right now.Don't worry.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.323
I'm not staying.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.977
500 pounds should be enough.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.196
I can't give you any money,
Patricia.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.414
You'll spend it on drugs.

19:58.458 --> 19:59.937
And I can't look
after you right now.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.809
Who asked you to look after me?

20:01.852 --> 20:05.943
I distinctly told you to leave
me the fuck alone, did I not?

20:05.987 --> 20:08.642
I believe I did.
Just give me

20:08.685 --> 20:11.035
some money and let me go.

20:11.079 --> 20:13.168
I love you, Pat.
I don't want you to die.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.517
That's so cute.

20:14.561 --> 20:16.171
Why are you so unhappy?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.218
Fuck you.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.224
Oh. Jesus.

20:37.105 --> 20:39.760
Thank goodness
you're home.

20:39.803 --> 20:42.066
May we come in?

20:42.110 --> 20:44.068
Sure.

20:46.114 --> 20:49.073
This is my sister, Patricia.

20:49.117 --> 20:51.032
Watch yourself-- okay.Is she okay?

20:51.075 --> 20:52.686
Yep, she's fine.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.949
She's drunk and stoned
and pathetic.

20:54.992 --> 20:58.822
Ugh, fuck off,
you sanctimonious cocksucker.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.259
THOMAS :
Shut up.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.173
Well, I know this is
a terrible imposition,

21:02.217 --> 21:04.437
but, uh, I have urgent
business to attend to

21:04.480 --> 21:06.439
and I can't leave her
alone in this state.

21:06.482 --> 21:09.616
She's liable to do... anything.

21:09.659 --> 21:12.096
Could I leave her with
you for a few hours?

21:12.140 --> 21:13.315
I'm kind of busy.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.186
Really?

21:15.230 --> 21:17.014
She won't cause you any trouble.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.625
Well, you just said
she's liable to do anything.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.148
Well, nothing you can't handle.

21:20.191 --> 21:21.541
I really don't have
anyone else to turn to,

21:21.584 --> 21:24.283
you being a woman of the world,
so to speak.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.375
How long will you be gone?

21:29.418 --> 21:30.593
Not long.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.029
Thank you so much. It's...Mm.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.335
...really very decent of you.

21:33.379 --> 21:34.728
PATRICIA:
Where the fuck are we?

21:38.819 --> 21:43.476
Now... she doesn't
know anything

21:43.519 --> 21:45.695
about our work
together. Nothing.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.088
MARTHA:
How do I know you?

21:47.131 --> 21:48.872
Yes, that's a good question.

21:48.916 --> 21:53.486
Uh, would you mind very much
if you're an ex-girlfriend?

21:53.529 --> 21:56.140
I can't think of a
more plausible story.

21:56.184 --> 21:58.317
Did you dump me
or did I dump you?

21:58.360 --> 22:02.756
Ah. Um, does it matter?

22:04.366 --> 22:06.760
She looks like the kind
of woman who'll ask.

22:06.803 --> 22:11.591
Well, I, I guess
you dumped me.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.244
Where am I?

22:13.288 --> 22:17.379
Pat, this is Martha Kane,
an old friend of mine.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.599
Now, she's gonna look after you
while I'm at work.

22:19.642 --> 22:22.558
Please behave yourself.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.865
All right, I have to go.

22:24.908 --> 22:26.910
Thank you so much.

22:29.696 --> 22:32.263
Oh, Lord...

22:37.486 --> 22:39.270
Who are you, again?

22:39.314 --> 22:42.404
Martha."Martha."

22:42.448 --> 22:47.540
Huh. Not Tommy's
usual type at all.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.977
What's his
usual type?

22:50.020 --> 22:52.806
You know, pretty little girls.

22:54.416 --> 22:57.811
You're more of a "modern
young woman," aren't you?

22:59.856 --> 23:04.818
I bet you have an interesting
job and all that crap.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.865
What makes you think
Thomas and I went out?

23:08.909 --> 23:11.172
Why else would you let
him use you like this?

23:11.215 --> 23:13.261
You got me there.

23:13.304 --> 23:16.525
Still pining
for him, huh?

23:16.569 --> 23:18.397
Actually, I dumped him.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.399
Hmm.

23:20.442 --> 23:23.358
I'm gonna make some coffee.
Would you like a cup?

23:23.402 --> 23:24.794
Sure.

23:26.056 --> 23:28.798
You dumped him, huh?

23:28.842 --> 23:31.671
Really?
Why not?

23:31.714 --> 23:36.415
Billionaire society stud Thomas
Wayne does not get dumped.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.938
Well, there's always
a first time.

23:37.981 --> 23:40.506
Well, aren't you fierce?

23:44.335 --> 23:46.076
What time is it?

23:46.120 --> 23:47.730
Uh, around 7:00.

23:47.774 --> 23:49.950
What day is it?

23:49.993 --> 23:51.386
Friday.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.084
Yay.

23:54.128 --> 23:57.174
Do you like parties, Martha?

24:06.009 --> 24:08.447
Fabulous, huh?

24:08.490 --> 24:10.797
Who the hell is this guy?

24:10.840 --> 24:12.929
Aleister is a... whosit,
a satanist.

24:12.973 --> 24:14.409
A satanist?

24:14.453 --> 24:16.411
Don't worry, he's cool.
Nobody minds.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.847
He's very fashionable.

24:20.154 --> 24:21.503
I don't know about this.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.288
You're not scared, are you?

24:24.332 --> 24:27.030
Please.

24:27.074 --> 24:29.076
Well, then...

24:49.792 --> 24:51.751
Patricia.

24:53.404 --> 24:55.668
Kiss me, you creature.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.544
Hello, beast.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.459
Who's this?

25:04.503 --> 25:07.506
This is my dear friend Martha.

25:07.549 --> 25:10.160
This is Aleister Crowley.How do you do?

25:12.772 --> 25:14.556
Oh, I love her already.

25:16.079 --> 25:18.429
We shall be great friends,
Martha.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.910
Time will tell,
Mr. Crowley.

25:20.954 --> 25:23.260
Oh, she's priceless.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.872
Thank you so much
for bringing her, Patricia.

25:25.915 --> 25:29.397
Eat, drink, be happy.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.574
Isn't he a scream?

25:32.618 --> 25:34.576
Uh, let's not
stay too long.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.187
You're worse
than my fucking brother.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.843
Live a little.

25:42.758 --> 25:43.977
Patricia...

25:44.020 --> 25:45.500
Can't. Busy.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.743
UNDINE:
Are you clear
on what's to be done?

26:12.788 --> 26:14.703
Uh-huh.

26:30.284 --> 26:32.503
Not dancing, Martha?

26:32.547 --> 26:34.331
Not my thing.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.073
What is your thing?

26:37.117 --> 26:39.162
I'm not sure I
really have a thing.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.643
Oh, everyone has a thing.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.471
My thing is love.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.170
That's not very satanic.

26:47.214 --> 26:48.998
On the contrary.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.696
Satan is love.

26:50.739 --> 26:53.481
One of us has been misinformed.

26:53.524 --> 26:56.615
In your heart,
you know I'm right.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.617
In your heart,

26:58.660 --> 27:00.967
you worship Satan
just as I do.

27:01.010 --> 27:03.317
Every beautiful woman does.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.623
Wow.

27:04.666 --> 27:07.016
You move fast.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.845
This, uh, warlock routine,

27:09.889 --> 27:11.891
it's all an
elaborate act, right?

27:11.934 --> 27:13.893
Yes, of course.

27:13.936 --> 27:16.417
Every life is an elaborate act.
Isn't yours?

27:16.460 --> 27:18.898
I mean, you don't
really worship Satan, do you?

27:18.941 --> 27:21.509
It's a fancy way
to seduce women.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.859
You think
I'm trying to seduce you?

27:23.903 --> 27:26.296
I think you'd try
to seduce a dead horse.

27:26.340 --> 27:29.952
That's funny. I think
you're trying to seduce me.

27:29.996 --> 27:32.694
Those sad eyes
are pulling me in.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.914
I'm trying very hard to resist.

27:34.957 --> 27:37.656
Broken-winged
romantics

27:37.699 --> 27:39.788
are a fatal weakness of mine.

27:41.921 --> 27:44.401
Is that right?

27:44.445 --> 27:48.362
It's so easy to make
them happy and whole.

27:48.405 --> 27:53.149
But then it's so easy
to break them again.

28:35.583 --> 28:38.020
I'm sorry about your
husband, Mrs. Thwaite.

28:38.064 --> 28:40.762
I shan't expect you
to believe me,

28:40.806 --> 28:42.982
but it wasn't
our doing.

28:43.025 --> 28:44.766
I don't believe you,
but I will forgive you.

28:44.810 --> 28:47.769
I'm not entirely
blameless myself.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.728
I hope you'll
forgive me, too.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.991
Of course.

28:52.034 --> 28:53.601
Do you have children,
Mrs. Gaunt?

28:53.644 --> 28:55.429
Dogs.Oh. What kind?

28:55.472 --> 28:57.431
Two lurchers,
various spaniels.

28:57.474 --> 28:59.738
We have golden Labs.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.044
Dogs are wonderful,
aren't they?

29:02.088 --> 29:04.699
So simple and honest.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.657
They also eat shit.

29:06.701 --> 29:09.486
Let's forgo the
small talk, shall we?

29:09.530 --> 29:13.403
Your organization is
in a wretched shambles.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.188
So you want to call a truce.

29:15.231 --> 29:17.799
Sincerely
this time?

29:17.843 --> 29:19.758
We do. Sincerely.

29:21.107 --> 29:23.762
Let's put the past
behind us, Mrs. Gaunt.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.502
Let's show the world
what can be done

29:25.546 --> 29:27.678
when two women reason together.

29:27.722 --> 29:29.680
Let's make peace.

29:29.724 --> 29:34.555
The country's descending into
barbarous bloody depravity.

29:34.598 --> 29:37.863
We must turn back
before it's too late.

29:37.906 --> 29:41.040
I agree. I agree
with all my heart.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.042
First things first.

29:43.085 --> 29:47.481
Order your grubby thugs
off the streets immediately,

29:47.524 --> 29:48.874
and I'll do the same.

29:48.917 --> 29:51.398
I suggest we draft

29:51.441 --> 29:54.618
a-a brief joint statement

29:54.662 --> 29:56.620
for the newspapers
as soon as possible.

29:56.664 --> 29:59.667
Then we'll-we'll hash out
the nuts and bolts later.

29:59.710 --> 30:02.626
UNDINE:
Wonderful.

30:02.670 --> 30:05.804
I'm so happy, Mrs. Gaunt.

30:07.066 --> 30:09.068
May I hug you?

30:10.373 --> 30:12.375
If you must.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.655
Oh. Hi, Martha.

30:31.699 --> 30:35.311
Patricia.

30:35.355 --> 30:36.835
What the hell's
going on?

30:39.185 --> 30:41.578
What?Look at you.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.972
Look at you.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.847
You've been crying.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.154
Because I'm happy.

30:52.198 --> 30:53.808
Okay.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.723
It's time for us to go.

Extra, extra! Thank you, sir!Thank you.

34:22.799 --> 34:25.628
He's going
to be trouble.

34:25.672 --> 34:27.978
Hatchet Frank?

34:28.022 --> 34:29.545
I hope he tries,
the big nonce.

34:29.589 --> 34:31.417
Alfie...

34:31.460 --> 34:33.201
Yeah. I know, mate.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.421
No trouble. Sorry.

34:35.464 --> 34:37.945
I'm trying to act sensible,
but I'm on needles all the time.

34:37.988 --> 34:39.729
I don't know
what to do with myself.

34:41.862 --> 34:43.733
Ah, fuck.

34:43.777 --> 34:45.779
Good evening.

34:50.392 --> 34:52.351
What do you want?

34:52.394 --> 34:54.266
I'm looking
for my sister.

34:54.309 --> 34:56.137
Seriously?Seriously.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.443
Have you seen her?

34:57.486 --> 34:59.053
She likes this place.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.620
She hasn't been in.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.274
What about Martha Kane?

35:02.317 --> 35:03.971
What, you mislaid
her as well?

35:04.014 --> 35:05.190
They were together.

35:05.233 --> 35:06.365
They've been
missing two days.

35:06.408 --> 35:08.715
Can't help you. Sorry.

35:08.758 --> 35:10.978
Can't or won't help me?

35:11.021 --> 35:12.371
Both.

35:12.414 --> 35:13.894
I don't trust you.

35:13.937 --> 35:15.287
Never have,
never will.

35:15.330 --> 35:16.897
Alfred, you know what I do.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.551
I'm a fucking spy, okay?

35:18.594 --> 35:20.640
I ask too many questions,
I tell too many lies.

35:20.683 --> 35:22.076
That's my job.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.078
But you can trust me.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.124
I could be a good friend to you.

35:26.167 --> 35:27.125
All right, I'm convinced.

35:27.168 --> 35:29.083
I trust you.

35:30.606 --> 35:32.652
You, my friend, are too cynical
for your own good.

35:32.695 --> 35:33.957
If you see Martha
or Patricia,

35:34.001 --> 35:35.611
you ask them to
give me a call.

35:35.655 --> 35:37.178
Please.

35:37.222 --> 35:39.572
Will do, Mr. Wayne.

35:39.615 --> 35:42.357
HATCHET FRANK:
Shut your fucking noise,
you prick,

35:42.401 --> 35:45.752
or I'll have your fucking
balls for earrings!Calm down.

35:45.795 --> 35:47.362
All right,
everyone stay calm.What's the problem?

35:47.406 --> 35:49.277
The gentleman doesn't want
to pay his bill.

35:49.321 --> 35:50.626
Is that right, sir?

35:50.670 --> 35:52.715
You're the top boy, are you?

35:52.759 --> 35:55.153
You think
you can handle me?

35:55.196 --> 35:57.198
I hope that won't
be necessary, sir.

35:57.242 --> 35:59.026
Are you dissatisfied
with the service?

35:59.069 --> 36:00.984
Yeah, the drink's piss,
and the food's shit.

36:01.028 --> 36:02.334
CHADLEY:
Seven bottles of
our best champagne.

36:02.377 --> 36:03.857
100 oysters.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.511
Pay the bill.

36:05.554 --> 36:07.339
You kiss my ass,
you skinny poof.

36:07.382 --> 36:09.689
I've buried a dozen men that
could eat you for breakfast.

36:10.951 --> 36:12.692
Get out!

36:12.735 --> 36:13.780
Fuck you, mate!

36:17.740 --> 36:18.915
Stay where you are.

36:22.484 --> 36:23.442
Alfie!

36:55.517 --> 36:56.866
You all right?

36:57.911 --> 37:00.305
Yeah, not too bad.

37:00.348 --> 37:02.176
You happy now?

37:02.220 --> 37:05.875
Sorry, Bazza. I know
I was out of order, but...

37:08.574 --> 37:11.272
ORTSEY:
When the moon is full,

37:11.316 --> 37:13.535
bring me a red rose

37:13.579 --> 37:17.670
and the left hand
of a murderer.

37:29.290 --> 37:32.250
How'd she do that?

37:54.924 --> 37:56.622
Who is it?

37:58.798 --> 38:01.583
Alfred. Now, I don't know
what the hell is going on,

38:01.627 --> 38:03.324
but I brought you
what you asked for.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.979
Alfred.

38:06.022 --> 38:08.024
What was it I asked for?

38:14.292 --> 38:17.295
Oh, yes, now I remember.

38:17.338 --> 38:21.690
The case of
the strangled fiancée.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.999
How did you get in here?

38:26.042 --> 38:27.130
Does it matter?

38:27.174 --> 38:28.306
No.

38:28.349 --> 38:30.743
But I'm impressed.

38:30.786 --> 38:33.049
Well done.

38:44.060 --> 38:46.280
What you gonna do with
the hand I gave you?

38:46.324 --> 38:48.587
Me? Nothing.

38:48.630 --> 38:50.502
It's just a
hard-to-get object.

38:50.545 --> 38:52.504
Shows you're
a serious customer.

38:52.547 --> 38:54.767
Tigs likes to chew on them,
don't you?

38:58.423 --> 39:00.468
Speaking of hands,
take mine.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.738
Tell me...

39:09.782 --> 39:11.436
your dreams.

39:11.479 --> 39:14.395
I don't have any.

39:14.439 --> 39:17.877
I thought I'd be
married to Esme.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.662
I mean your sleeping dreams.

39:20.706 --> 39:23.578
Oh, I have 'em, but they
go as soon as I wake up.

39:23.622 --> 39:25.145
I don't remember.

39:25.188 --> 39:27.277
Nothing?

39:27.321 --> 39:28.583
Scraps.

39:28.627 --> 39:33.327
Are they scraps of good dreams
or bad dreams?

39:34.589 --> 39:36.852
Do people have good dreams?

39:46.949 --> 39:49.256
What do you see?

40:28.295 --> 40:30.036
There you are, Alfie.

40:30.079 --> 40:32.081
I was worried about you.

40:32.125 --> 40:33.648
I was in the jungle, Mum.

40:33.692 --> 40:36.390
It was horrible.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.261
What did you do to me?

40:38.305 --> 40:40.438
Nothing.

40:40.481 --> 40:42.004
You can go now.

40:47.140 --> 40:49.316
That's all?That's all.

40:49.359 --> 40:52.232
Sounds like a
damn poor witch.

40:52.275 --> 40:53.712
There must be more.

40:53.755 --> 40:55.235
Same again, lads?

40:56.454 --> 40:58.238
Just a glass of water
for me, please.

40:58.281 --> 41:00.632
For fuck sake,
Spanish, go away.

41:00.675 --> 41:02.808
Shh.

41:02.851 --> 41:06.812
♪ 'Twas there that you
whispered tenderly ♪

41:06.855 --> 41:09.249
♪ That you loved me

41:09.292 --> 41:12.295
♪ You'd always be

41:41.890 --> 41:43.892
Alfred?

41:46.025 --> 41:47.983
Yeah. What?

41:48.027 --> 41:50.551
You fell asleep for a moment.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.903
I was dreaming.

41:54.947 --> 41:56.688
The tea.
There was something in the tea.

41:56.731 --> 41:59.865
Of course there was
something in the tea.

41:59.908 --> 42:01.910
I'm a witch.

42:04.478 --> 42:07.046
My God.

42:07.089 --> 42:09.048
It was him.

42:09.091 --> 42:10.919
The captain.

42:10.963 --> 42:12.573
He killed Esme.
Is that it?

42:12.617 --> 42:15.533
I don't know. Is it?

42:17.535 --> 42:19.885
The captain.

42:19.928 --> 42:22.888
I hope I've been
of some help.

42:22.931 --> 42:25.586
You have to go now.

42:54.136 --> 42:57.226
Alfie, thank goodness.
Where have you been?

42:57.270 --> 42:59.707
I was out with the boys.

42:59.751 --> 43:01.579
All night?

43:03.711 --> 43:07.106
: Oh, as long
as you're home safe.

43:08.803 --> 43:10.631
Ooh, you're as
cold as ice.

43:11.763 --> 43:13.503
And you've cut yourself.

43:13.547 --> 43:15.810
How'd you do that?

43:15.854 --> 43:18.073
I don't know.

43:18.117 --> 43:20.206
It's nothing.

43:20.249 --> 43:22.425
Oh.

43:47.712 --> 43:50.976
Those posh bastards in London
will swallow their teeth

43:51.019 --> 43:53.456
when they see you,
won't they, Mrs. Spicer?

43:53.500 --> 43:55.371
They'll be extremely surprised.

43:55.415 --> 43:57.330
I am looking rather spiffy,
aren't I?

43:58.897 --> 44:00.899
I'm that proud of you.

44:02.465 --> 44:05.599
I wish you'd wait a bit,
though, before going south.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.514
Get all your strength back.

44:07.557 --> 44:09.690
I am fit as a
fiddle, my dear.

44:09.734 --> 44:12.345
Ooh, ooh!

44:12.388 --> 44:14.652
Wreaking revenge
and redeeming your rights

44:14.695 --> 44:17.655
and saving the country is all
well and good to talk about,

44:17.698 --> 44:21.180
but doing it, well,
it's a different thing.

44:21.223 --> 44:23.138
You'll overtax yourself.

44:23.182 --> 44:25.837
No. I've never
felt more alive.

44:25.880 --> 44:28.753
More full of
passionate energy.

44:28.796 --> 44:32.408
The winds of destiny
are broad abeam.

44:34.802 --> 44:36.499
Thank you, Bet.

44:37.544 --> 44:39.633
Give over.
No.

44:39.677 --> 44:42.462
If it wasn't for your
friendship and generosity,

44:42.505 --> 44:43.811
then I...

44:43.855 --> 44:45.117
PEGGY:
Hello?

44:45.160 --> 44:47.772
I was... I was just
saying, Peggy,

44:47.815 --> 44:52.037
I owe my life and my soul
to your-your deep kindness.

44:52.080 --> 44:54.430
I shall never forget.

44:54.474 --> 44:56.911
Go on.BET: He says he's off

44:56.955 --> 44:59.609
back to London
soon as he's made arrangements.

44:59.653 --> 45:02.047
Oh.

45:02.090 --> 45:03.831
Are you sure you're ready?

45:03.875 --> 45:05.659
See?

45:05.703 --> 45:09.315
I've been very happy here, but
my duty says that I must go.

45:09.358 --> 45:11.621
There's no time to waste.

45:11.665 --> 45:12.753
PEGGY:
Then you must go.

45:12.797 --> 45:15.277
Won't say we won't miss you.

45:15.321 --> 45:18.498
Will you come with me to London?

45:18.541 --> 45:20.065
Both of you?

45:21.762 --> 45:23.329
Really?

45:23.372 --> 45:26.375
Well, I have a battle ahead.

45:26.419 --> 45:28.769
I'll need loyal friends.

45:28.813 --> 45:31.816
Friends that I love and trust.

45:31.859 --> 45:33.774
PEGGY:
London.

45:33.818 --> 45:35.776
I don't know.

45:38.997 --> 45:40.433
We'll go.

45:41.477 --> 45:43.349
Splendid.

45:43.392 --> 45:45.830
And then everybody
laughed at him.

45:45.873 --> 45:47.570
Do you remember?

45:47.614 --> 45:49.137
I do.Aye.

45:49.181 --> 45:51.792
The captain.

45:51.836 --> 45:53.838
Tall, skinny fella. Posh.

45:53.881 --> 45:55.013
Yeah, that's right. Him.

45:55.056 --> 45:56.144
I say!

45:56.188 --> 45:57.319
Steady on, Doris.

46:00.801 --> 46:02.107
What about him?

46:02.150 --> 46:03.586
When we buried Spanish,

46:03.630 --> 46:05.240
he was there, watching.

46:05.284 --> 46:08.113
You were whistling
"Lili Marlene."

46:08.156 --> 46:09.592
I caught his eye.
He looked away.

46:09.636 --> 46:11.725
But for a split second,
I saw his face.

46:15.294 --> 46:17.513
Pure murder.

46:17.557 --> 46:18.688
I forgot all about him.

46:18.732 --> 46:19.864
Never thought of him
all these years.

46:19.907 --> 46:21.387
Alfred...I think it was him.

46:21.430 --> 46:23.781
The captain, he killed
Esme to punish me.

46:23.824 --> 46:25.478
Lots of captains
wanted to punish you.

46:25.521 --> 46:26.784
No, I think it was him.

46:26.827 --> 46:28.611
The witch told you this?

46:28.655 --> 46:30.483
Well, not exactly. No.

46:30.526 --> 46:33.791
I saw him-- in a dream.

46:33.834 --> 46:37.707
Well, more of a
vision, really.

46:37.751 --> 46:39.666
He was crystal clear, though.

46:39.709 --> 46:41.407
He has been waiting.

46:41.450 --> 46:43.496
Waiting all this time
to pay me back.

46:43.539 --> 46:46.629
For embarrassing him
five years ago?

46:46.673 --> 46:48.153
Now, look, if you could see

46:48.196 --> 46:49.937
how he looked at me,
you'd understand.

46:51.765 --> 46:54.855
I remembered his name.

46:54.899 --> 46:58.293
ALFRED:
Captain John
Fitz-Smytth Curzon,

46:58.337 --> 47:01.906
Third Battalion,
Rutland Fusiliers.

47:01.949 --> 47:04.169
I called the Army
Records Office.

47:04.212 --> 47:06.867
He survived the war.

47:06.911 --> 47:08.913
That's where he lives.

47:08.956 --> 47:10.740
Alfie,

47:10.784 --> 47:12.873
just so we're clear,

47:12.917 --> 47:14.919
you've no proof
yet-- nothing.

47:14.962 --> 47:17.573
A feeling.

47:17.617 --> 47:20.272
No bloodshed.

47:20.315 --> 47:22.187
Please say yes.

47:25.190 --> 47:27.583
Yeah.

47:51.042 --> 47:53.044
ALFRED:
What the fuck is this?

48:00.703 --> 48:01.922
"Ha ha.

48:01.966 --> 48:04.359
"A little too
late, my friend.

48:04.403 --> 48:06.535
"Don't think I'm
sorry or scared.

48:06.579 --> 48:09.625
I'm glad you know the truth."

48:56.194 --> 49:00.198
