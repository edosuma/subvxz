WEBVTT

00:03.666 --> 00:05.686
Hey. Have y'all seen my yellow coat?

00:06.166 --> 00:08.036
I think it's on the sofa.

00:13.576 --> 00:14.636
Ooh.

00:14.656 --> 00:16.015
- I'm going to class.
- All right.

00:16.026 --> 00:17.246
Have a good day.

00:17.786 --> 00:18.936
No.

00:18.946 --> 00:20.236
You don't have a maid service.

00:20.246 --> 00:22.046
Wash your damn bowl.

00:29.416 --> 00:30.656
Blanca.

00:30.666 --> 00:32.906
- Huh?
- I'm out. See ya later.

00:32.926 --> 00:34.246
Okay. Be safe.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.446
Back so soon?

01:26.546 --> 01:28.346
Yeah, I forgot something.

01:29.346 --> 01:31.386
What is it? Maybe I can help you.

01:31.546 --> 01:33.386
Nah, I got it.

01:33.406 --> 01:34.616
No, I think I got it.

01:36.286 --> 01:38.256
Why in the hell do you need a pager?

01:38.356 --> 01:39.586
And don't lie to me.

01:39.626 --> 01:41.806
- To keep up with my boys.
- What boys?

01:41.846 --> 01:43.416
- Damon? Ricky?
- No.

01:43.426 --> 01:45.366
My boys. You don't know 'em.

01:45.466 --> 01:47.206
Yo, what's with the seventh degree?

01:48.726 --> 01:50.286
I told you about my rules.

01:50.306 --> 01:53.446
If I ever catch you bringing
that stuff into my home,

01:53.526 --> 01:54.626
you're out.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.306
How come you're going in on me

01:56.406 --> 01:57.826
but you ain't saying nothing to Angel

01:57.846 --> 01:59.406
about selling her ass for cash?

01:59.426 --> 02:00.536
You don't get an opinion on

02:00.546 --> 02:02.136
what she does with her body.

02:02.146 --> 02:03.356
When you're a transsexual,

02:03.386 --> 02:04.782
you take the work where you can get it.

02:04.806 --> 02:07.026
She's making a safe dollar
dancing at Show World.

02:07.046 --> 02:09.746
She's not putting poison on the streets.

02:10.045 --> 02:12.206
That shit is ruining our community.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.186
I told you,

02:14.296 --> 02:15.456
I'm not selling drugs.

02:15.486 --> 02:17.296
You listen to me.

02:17.926 --> 02:20.056
I told you when you joined Evangelista

02:20.086 --> 02:21.726
what I wouldn't tolerate.

02:23.466 --> 02:25.706
You get caught doing anything illegal,

02:25.866 --> 02:27.686
don't make me your one call.

02:45.306 --> 02:48.226
The category is...

02:48.326 --> 02:50.556
Live...

02:51.126 --> 02:53.266
Work...

02:53.286 --> 02:57.286
Pose!

03:26.446 --> 03:27.886
Well, well, well.

03:28.446 --> 03:30.332
Don't you want a bite or
something to drink first?

03:30.356 --> 03:31.896
I've had plenty of bites and drinks

03:31.906 --> 03:33.076
since you've been gone,

03:33.086 --> 03:35.336
but I haven't had my man for two months

03:35.346 --> 03:38.126
and I refuse to wait one moment longer.

03:38.226 --> 03:39.626
How did it all go?

03:39.726 --> 03:41.296
Sold some, bought more.

03:41.396 --> 03:42.906
Mm.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.686
Are you tucking?

04:00.016 --> 04:02.626
My tucking days are over, sweetheart.

04:03.546 --> 04:05.046
Come on.

04:05.066 --> 04:06.066
When was the last time

04:06.076 --> 04:07.336
you got the chance to take a ride

04:07.346 --> 04:09.866
in a brand-new pussy?

04:10.056 --> 04:11.326
One thing.

04:11.966 --> 04:14.156
I ask you for one thing. For that,

04:14.196 --> 04:16.402
I was willing to give you
everything you ever dreamed of.

04:16.426 --> 04:19.505
This is the only thing I've
ever really dreamed of.

04:19.586 --> 04:21.296
To be a complete woman.

04:21.305 --> 04:22.936
Well, then I guess we're done here.

04:22.986 --> 04:24.006
Do you love me

04:24.026 --> 04:25.846
or was this all just about the sex?

04:25.886 --> 04:28.976
I don't come here... for that.

04:29.366 --> 04:31.226
I can get that anywhere.

04:31.246 --> 04:32.606
I'm in control here.

04:33.866 --> 04:34.976
What I want.

04:35.086 --> 04:36.916
What I like.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.786
The price you would pay
for not giving it to me.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.856
I was abundantly clear
the very first night

04:41.866 --> 04:43.156
that we met at that bar.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.686
You ruined it.

04:45.746 --> 04:46.886
I'm not ruined.

04:46.906 --> 04:48.326
I'm reborn.

04:48.706 --> 04:50.236
A complete woman.

04:50.246 --> 04:53.586
This is an act of
selfishness and stupidity.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.046
So what happens now?

05:02.146 --> 05:04.206
You throw me out onto the street corners

05:04.216 --> 05:05.416
like a Hefty bag filled with

05:05.426 --> 05:07.426
last night's takeout containers?

05:08.326 --> 05:10.586
I thought our love was
stronger than that.

05:10.956 --> 05:13.666
I thought it would take
more to make you hate me.

05:17.996 --> 05:19.466
I hate you...

05:20.396 --> 05:23.626
because I love you.

05:23.746 --> 05:26.486
Because you are the
best thing in my life.

05:26.586 --> 05:28.236
This place,

05:28.826 --> 05:30.386
with you,

05:31.226 --> 05:32.906
was my cocoon.

05:35.826 --> 05:38.056
And you took it away from me.

05:38.066 --> 05:40.526
Because you refuse to even try.

05:40.606 --> 05:42.116
You knew the rules,

05:42.216 --> 05:44.106
and you broke them.

05:45.016 --> 05:47.156
You lost it all.

05:47.256 --> 05:49.526
I give you two weeks before
you cool off and realize

05:49.546 --> 05:50.986
that the best of me still remains

05:51.096 --> 05:52.296
and you can't live without it.

05:52.396 --> 05:54.996
Good luck finding another
girl who looks like me.

05:55.026 --> 05:57.226
You're lucky I believe
in second chances.

05:59.186 --> 06:01.236
Five, six, seven, eight.

06:01.336 --> 06:03.326
One, two, three, four,

06:03.346 --> 06:05.106
five, six, seven, eight.

06:05.166 --> 06:07.206
One, two, three, four,

06:07.266 --> 06:08.626
five... Candy.

06:08.706 --> 06:10.746
Come on!

06:10.766 --> 06:12.726
The theme is Bizarre,

06:12.766 --> 06:14.146
not Halloween.

06:15.526 --> 06:17.246
Think avant-garde.

06:17.766 --> 06:19.486
Think otherworldly.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.016
This is otherworldly.

06:21.026 --> 06:23.036
No, this is Freddy Krueger. That.

06:23.056 --> 06:24.106
- That's what you're doing.
- Stop.

06:24.126 --> 06:25.846
You're not...

06:26.626 --> 06:27.686
What?

06:27.706 --> 06:28.896
I can't enter my own abode

06:28.906 --> 06:30.966
without you children gawking at me?

06:30.986 --> 06:32.576
We just weren't expecting you.

06:32.586 --> 06:34.706
Well, here I am.

06:34.786 --> 06:35.866
I'll be staying the night,

06:35.926 --> 06:37.826
and I need you all to
clear out of the bedroom.

06:37.846 --> 06:39.186
Hey, that's the girls' room.

06:39.206 --> 06:40.686
Where are we supposed to sleep?

06:40.726 --> 06:41.916
We have futons.

06:41.926 --> 06:42.996
Or fold up some blankets

06:43.006 --> 06:44.126
and make a bed on the floor.

06:44.146 --> 06:46.176
You have a brain... use it.

06:46.226 --> 06:47.376
Hold up.

06:47.386 --> 06:49.446
You want the entire room to yourself

06:49.506 --> 06:51.546
while we sleep on the floor?

06:52.386 --> 06:53.786
I pay the rent here.

06:56.746 --> 06:58.926
Why aren't you at Daddy Dick's place?

07:00.126 --> 07:02.806
I'm exercising my independence.

07:02.866 --> 07:04.246
He finally threw you out?

07:04.286 --> 07:06.096
We had a small lovers' spat,

07:06.126 --> 07:08.586
and now I'm giving him an
opportunity to miss me.

07:08.626 --> 07:10.426
What happen if he don't miss you?

07:10.446 --> 07:12.282
- What if he cuts you off?
- Yeah, who's gonna pay

07:12.306 --> 07:14.106
- for this apartment?
- Don't worry, children.

07:14.146 --> 07:15.776
Mother would never let a single man

07:15.786 --> 07:17.306
be in charge of her destiny.

07:17.326 --> 07:19.946
I have my fingers in many
pots around this city.

07:19.986 --> 07:21.866
Is that what they call being a slut now?

07:21.886 --> 07:23.346
Shut the fuck up!

07:26.886 --> 07:29.166
Let's not get ahead of
ourselves here, children.

07:29.226 --> 07:31.386
I'm sure Mr. Ford will
come to his senses

07:31.406 --> 07:32.546
by the end of the week.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.156
And until then,

07:34.166 --> 07:35.806
there are a few rules
I'd like to institute

07:35.826 --> 07:37.526
to assure that my stay here is up to par

07:37.546 --> 07:39.036
with my standards of living.

07:39.046 --> 07:40.866
Rule number one,

07:40.906 --> 07:42.086
no sucking your teeth!

07:42.106 --> 07:44.426
Rule number two, only
Mother smokes in the house.

07:44.526 --> 07:46.406
No gum chewing, no late-night music,

07:46.426 --> 07:48.566
no sleeping in after 1:00 p.m.

07:48.746 --> 07:50.386
Well?

07:50.406 --> 07:52.146
Make Mother another drink!

07:53.276 --> 07:55.306
Come on. Come on. It's okay.

08:04.156 --> 08:06.666
Thank God you're home. Shh.

08:06.706 --> 08:07.716
Wait, why are you here?

08:07.726 --> 08:09.056
Aren't you back with that white boy?

08:09.066 --> 08:10.312
Blanca asked me to come over to talk.

08:10.336 --> 08:12.646
I don't know how, but she
found out Papi's dealing.

08:12.786 --> 08:15.686
She just cross-examined
me like she Matlock.

08:15.706 --> 08:17.986
She tore up the whole apartment
looking for evidence.

08:18.006 --> 08:19.876
- You didn't tell her the truth?
- No.

08:19.976 --> 08:21.026
I mean,

08:21.046 --> 08:22.037
I've teased him about it,

08:22.047 --> 08:23.746
but I'm not gonna throw
him under the bus.

08:26.986 --> 08:28.326
Damon, is that you?

08:32.155 --> 08:33.946
Yes, Mother.

08:35.126 --> 08:38.866
Just... just listen...

08:53.306 --> 08:56.006
Do you know why I allowed
Ricky to join this house?

08:56.106 --> 08:57.706
Because you saw his potential?

08:57.726 --> 08:59.366
Because you vouched for him.

08:59.546 --> 09:00.906
And I trust you.

09:01.766 --> 09:04.266
Lies are a form of disrespect.

09:04.306 --> 09:07.026
In this house, I expect all
of you to tell the truth.

09:08.926 --> 09:10.586
Is Papi on drugs?

09:10.646 --> 09:11.966
What? No.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.206
But he's selling 'em, right?

09:13.606 --> 09:14.646
No.

09:14.686 --> 09:15.942
If I find out you're lying to me...

09:15.966 --> 09:17.626
He isn't doing drugs.

09:17.666 --> 09:19.166
I would've told you if he was.

09:19.266 --> 09:20.926
All right, tell Ricky to come here.

09:30.046 --> 09:31.426
What happened?

09:31.446 --> 09:32.786
She wants to talk to you.

09:36.016 --> 09:38.106
Listen to me.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.216
Not a word.

09:46.866 --> 09:48.156
Sit down.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.996
Ricky, have you enjoyed
living in my house?

09:55.006 --> 09:56.406
Of course I have.

09:56.446 --> 09:58.216
When we met, you had nowhere to go.

09:58.236 --> 10:01.276
I took you in and gave
you shelter and food,

10:02.006 --> 10:05.206
'cause I couldn't stand thinking
of you being on the streets.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.106
I know I'm not perfect, but I'm trying

10:08.116 --> 10:10.946
real hard to be a good
mother to all y'all.

10:10.956 --> 10:12.066
And you have been.

10:12.106 --> 10:14.876
This is the first place I ever
been that feels like a home.

10:14.886 --> 10:16.546
And we have to keep it safe.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.356
So I'm-a only ask you one time.

10:21.526 --> 10:23.156
Is Papi doing drugs?

10:23.166 --> 10:24.166
No.

10:25.266 --> 10:27.136
He isn't doing drugs.

10:27.186 --> 10:28.426
You know,

10:29.106 --> 10:30.626
you and I,

10:31.786 --> 10:33.976
we're not that different.

10:34.076 --> 10:36.406
We know how to hustle.

10:36.606 --> 10:37.646
How to survive.

10:37.656 --> 10:39.526
We grew up on the streets.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.006
But we not on the streets no more.

10:43.486 --> 10:45.116
This is our house.

10:45.216 --> 10:47.106
And I'm trying to keep it safe.

10:47.126 --> 10:49.646
I can't do that if
you're not being honest.

10:49.726 --> 10:52.406
Yo, I'm not a snitch.

10:52.426 --> 10:54.986
Street code don't apply here, baby.

11:01.546 --> 11:02.966
He's dealing.

11:03.006 --> 11:04.266
At the piers.

11:04.276 --> 11:05.786
I should've told you sooner.

11:05.826 --> 11:07.536
I'm sorry I disrespected your rules.

11:07.546 --> 11:09.566
It'll never happen again.

11:10.106 --> 11:13.046
Look, I'm trying hard to change my life.

11:13.446 --> 11:15.926
I know this is where I need to be.

11:17.116 --> 11:18.346
Look,

11:18.386 --> 11:20.216
please,

11:20.326 --> 11:22.446
don't kick me out.

11:48.026 --> 11:49.256
What you want to do is you want

11:49.266 --> 11:51.216
to go straight down the
block, make a left,

11:51.316 --> 11:53.976
hit another left. You heard? All good.

11:53.986 --> 11:55.496
Get the fuck out of here.
And drink some water.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.746
You look thirsty, too.

12:01.396 --> 12:03.186
I knew it.

12:03.206 --> 12:04.296
You lied to me.

12:04.336 --> 12:05.686
And the worst part about it is

12:05.726 --> 12:07.406
that you did it right to my face.

12:07.466 --> 12:09.166
- I didn't lie.
- Yes, you did.

12:09.206 --> 12:11.246
Every time you walked
out of that apartment,

12:11.266 --> 12:13.076
you came here to sell drugs.

12:13.106 --> 12:14.286
What else am I supposed to do?

12:14.306 --> 12:15.606
Follow my rules.

12:15.666 --> 12:17.176
Find a real job.

12:17.206 --> 12:18.656
Yo, you wasn't complaining about

12:18.666 --> 12:19.926
where my loot was coming from

12:19.946 --> 12:22.046
- when it was paying for your groceries.
- You never told me

12:22.066 --> 12:23.826
that it was dirty money. You
told me that you worked

12:23.846 --> 12:26.156
at a bodega. And I believed you.

12:26.256 --> 12:28.046
Papi, you put your family at risk.

12:28.106 --> 12:29.286
What family?

12:29.356 --> 12:31.426
Ain't nobody here.

12:31.506 --> 12:33.436
I've been on my own since I was 13,

12:33.446 --> 12:34.956
in and out of foster homes.

12:35.066 --> 12:36.816
Ain't nobody ever gave me shit.

12:36.826 --> 12:38.906
I did.

12:39.446 --> 12:41.446
Warm food, shelter.

12:42.086 --> 12:43.836
And you ain't the only
one who had to learn

12:43.846 --> 12:45.306
how to survive on their own.

12:45.336 --> 12:47.306
But I didn't resort to dealing.

12:48.486 --> 12:49.846
You could get arrested or worse.

12:49.886 --> 12:51.386
It can't get no worse.

12:51.426 --> 12:53.076
What other choices are there

12:53.176 --> 12:57.326
for a 20-year-old with an
eighth grade education?

12:58.206 --> 12:59.686
I'm so disappointed in you.

12:59.766 --> 13:01.776
Yo, stop acting like you're my moms,

13:01.786 --> 13:03.306
'cause you're not.

13:07.646 --> 13:09.626
I want you out by morning.

13:12.106 --> 13:14.236
And if you don't pick up your shit,

13:14.336 --> 13:16.846
I'm-a put it on the street myself.

13:19.686 --> 13:21.826
You're just gonna turn
around and leave me?

13:22.886 --> 13:25.106
Without giving me another chance?

13:25.126 --> 13:27.326
Where am I supposed to go?

13:28.166 --> 13:29.606
Blanca!

13:30.306 --> 13:31.986
Hey, I didn't mean it!

13:32.086 --> 13:34.956
Hey, you hear what I
said?! I didn't mean it!

13:48.626 --> 13:50.306
I got all my stuff.

13:54.686 --> 13:55.866
Where will you go?

13:55.906 --> 13:57.326
I'll figure it out.

13:57.446 --> 13:59.786
Always do.

14:00.806 --> 14:03.206
Make sure you let us know.

14:05.426 --> 14:06.486
We're gonna miss you.

14:06.526 --> 14:07.696
I'll miss y'all, too.

14:12.206 --> 14:14.166
Blanca, you may not believe this, but...

14:15.826 --> 14:17.146
I'm sorry.

14:19.146 --> 14:20.786
I'm out.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.206
Peace.

14:25.666 --> 14:27.146
I looked out for you.

14:27.256 --> 14:29.246
Treated you as a brother because I knew

14:29.256 --> 14:30.486
what you meant to Damon.

14:30.526 --> 14:31.686
After everything,

14:31.786 --> 14:33.946
I expected you to have my back, too.

14:34.026 --> 14:35.336
Before or after you told him I was

14:35.356 --> 14:36.526
the hit it and quit it type?

14:39.096 --> 14:41.506
That's why your punk ass ratted me out?

14:42.706 --> 14:44.466
Call me a punk again.

14:44.606 --> 14:47.766
I'd watch my back, punk.

14:48.006 --> 14:49.766
Whoa!

14:51.206 --> 14:52.446
Damon...

14:54.406 --> 14:57.536
- How could you do this to me?
- Stop! You did this to yourself.

14:57.546 --> 15:00.066
- What the hell are you doing?
- I thought we was fam!

15:00.086 --> 15:02.566
Well, you thought wrong.
This is my house.

15:02.586 --> 15:05.386
I ain't going back and sleeping
on a park bench for nobody.

15:05.466 --> 15:06.766
Especially not you.

15:06.846 --> 15:08.206
Punk.

15:41.206 --> 15:42.666
- It's good.
- Yeah?

15:42.786 --> 15:44.096
Yeah.

15:44.196 --> 15:45.306
I ain't never cooked nothing

15:45.326 --> 15:46.786
in my whole life.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.196
Did I do it right?

15:48.226 --> 15:50.266
- It's perfect.
- Mm.

15:57.446 --> 15:59.046
You're really not going nowhere tonight?

15:59.126 --> 16:00.466
No.

16:00.506 --> 16:02.216
Got nowhere to be.

16:02.316 --> 16:04.826
It's just you and me all night long.

16:04.946 --> 16:07.406
- Like the song.
- Like the song.

16:07.526 --> 16:08.986
So you getting a divorce?

16:09.606 --> 16:10.916
I don't know yet.

16:11.026 --> 16:13.026
Uh, I think so.

16:13.366 --> 16:15.586
We're gonna work something
out with the kids.

16:15.926 --> 16:19.996
She, uh, says I'm a shit
husband but a good father.

16:20.006 --> 16:21.546
Kids need their fathers.

16:22.806 --> 16:24.666
Especially little girls.

16:27.976 --> 16:29.226
What about work?

16:29.236 --> 16:31.236
You get fired for
beating that guy's ass?

16:31.966 --> 16:34.006
No. I didn't.

16:34.116 --> 16:36.126
Apparently, that kind of
expression of manliness

16:36.146 --> 16:38.546
- is encouraged there.
- Mm.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.136
Now everyone thinks I'm a rock star

16:40.146 --> 16:42.016
for leaving my wife for my mistress.

16:42.026 --> 16:45.256
So did he tell anyone
what kind of girl I am?

16:45.356 --> 16:46.496
No.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.866
He just said he couldn't
tell if you were a

16:47.886 --> 16:49.806
Puerto Rican girl or a black girl.

16:49.826 --> 16:52.466
See? We can do anything.

16:52.546 --> 16:53.876
So what do you want to do with our first

16:53.886 --> 16:55.096
whole night here together?

16:57.766 --> 16:59.466
The skirt, too short, change.

16:59.486 --> 17:00.866
Dad, this is the style.

17:00.906 --> 17:03.366
- Myra, isn't this the style?
- Change.

17:03.426 --> 17:05.906
You okay?

17:06.006 --> 17:07.291
Yeah.

17:07.316 --> 17:08.945
I'm great. Why?

17:08.965 --> 17:10.746
I don't want you to get bored of me.

17:16.626 --> 17:18.866
- Um...
- Hmm?

17:21.256 --> 17:22.996
You know what I really want?

17:23.786 --> 17:25.346
What you really want?

17:25.366 --> 17:27.066
Not that.

17:27.086 --> 17:28.826
Um...

17:30.866 --> 17:33.006
I want to see your life.

17:33.106 --> 17:34.926
These ballrooms you're
always talking about

17:34.936 --> 17:36.496
with the, with the
trophies and everything.

17:36.506 --> 17:38.226
I-I want to...

17:38.526 --> 17:40.226
I want to see that.

17:45.046 --> 17:46.426
For real?

17:46.466 --> 17:48.086
I mean, you know what my life is like.

17:48.186 --> 17:50.586
It's boring, it's stupid.

17:50.686 --> 17:52.846
Every movie, TV show, ad
in a magazine shows you

17:52.866 --> 17:55.726
- what my life is like, but...
- Come on.

17:55.826 --> 17:57.896
Only chance I'm gonna get
of understanding your world

17:57.906 --> 17:59.916
is if you show me.

17:59.926 --> 18:03.826
I've never brought a
date to the ball before.

18:03.886 --> 18:06.066
Well, I'm not a date.

18:08.106 --> 18:09.826
I'm your boyfriend.

18:13.586 --> 18:15.246
My boyfriend.

18:15.326 --> 18:16.846
Your boyfriend.

18:31.746 --> 18:33.526
What do you mean "evicted"?

18:34.686 --> 18:38.486
This says we're two
months behind on rent.

18:38.566 --> 18:40.326
So what? I'm a little late on payments.

18:40.366 --> 18:41.626
N-N-N-N-N-No.

18:41.686 --> 18:43.446
I know exactly what's going on here.

18:43.486 --> 18:44.926
You spent every last penny you had

18:44.946 --> 18:46.146
on that pussy, didn't you?

18:46.246 --> 18:48.106
On top of stealing our Christmas stash,

18:48.216 --> 18:50.206
you pocketed your sugar
daddy's allowance

18:50.216 --> 18:51.806
and didn't pay rent on this place.

18:51.846 --> 18:54.926
My finances are none of your business.

18:54.946 --> 18:57.776
Uh, they are when it's us who's
gonna be put on the streets.

18:57.786 --> 18:58.786
Exactly.

18:58.796 --> 19:00.956
Hush. Mother will settle this.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.956
I still have a couple of furs left.

19:03.066 --> 19:05.726
I will sell them for you
ungrateful children,

19:05.746 --> 19:07.706
because I am still your mother.

19:07.746 --> 19:09.586
So, you don't have any money at all?

19:09.646 --> 19:10.796
She's got nothing.

19:10.806 --> 19:12.666
I don't know about the rest of you,

19:12.726 --> 19:14.086
but I'm not waiting around for them

19:14.106 --> 19:16.046
to cut the lights off on this place.

19:16.486 --> 19:18.166
I'm leaving.

19:18.526 --> 19:19.826
Me, too.

19:23.986 --> 19:25.626
Fools! Where will you go?

19:25.686 --> 19:28.446
- What will you do?
- I'll start my own house.

19:31.256 --> 19:33.746
That's the gag of all gags.

19:33.806 --> 19:36.156
What? If you can do it,

19:36.166 --> 19:37.706
so can I.

19:37.966 --> 19:41.126
I have the cred for it
at the balls. Remember?

19:41.236 --> 19:42.936
Oh, my dear children.

19:43.036 --> 19:46.136
I would seriously reconsider
this joke of an idea.

19:46.236 --> 19:48.416
If you were to ever part from me,

19:48.426 --> 19:50.066
I would destroy you.

19:50.086 --> 19:51.506
Fine.

19:52.006 --> 19:53.626
Bring it, bitch.

19:54.966 --> 19:56.946
You're going to regret this.

19:57.046 --> 19:58.776
Mr. Ford is going to take me back

19:58.786 --> 20:00.466
and I will have everything.

20:03.086 --> 20:05.026
Thank you.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.096
Is there a problem with
the elevator, Anthony?

20:15.106 --> 20:16.706
Mr. Ford said not to let you up.

20:16.766 --> 20:18.316
A little dramatic, don't you think?

20:18.336 --> 20:20.066
I'm just here to collect
a few of my things.

20:20.176 --> 20:22.026
Everything up there belongs to Mr. Ford.

20:23.206 --> 20:25.436
- Let me through.
- Keep at it, bitch.

20:25.446 --> 20:26.662
Nothing would make me
happier than to break

20:26.686 --> 20:28.206
your fucking freak face.

20:28.986 --> 20:30.336
Do you know where you're going, ma'am?

20:30.346 --> 20:32.506
Yes, I do, to the penthouse.

20:32.526 --> 20:34.096
Mr. Ford said unpack your things,

20:34.106 --> 20:35.097
make yourself comfortable.

20:35.107 --> 20:36.602
He'll be up there
sometime this afternoon.

20:36.626 --> 20:37.956
Thank you.

21:08.646 --> 21:09.886
Before your moms passed

21:09.926 --> 21:11.726
I told her I'd take care of you.

21:11.786 --> 21:13.936
If you're gonna go
disappearing like that again,

21:13.956 --> 21:15.786
you got to let me know first.

21:15.866 --> 21:17.126
Was laying low.

21:17.226 --> 21:18.576
Hanging at my girl's place.

21:18.586 --> 21:20.226
Hey, you got a lady?

21:20.336 --> 21:22.006
I gotta meet her.

21:25.166 --> 21:26.786
So what'chu need?

21:26.946 --> 21:30.846
Uh, dope's not really selling.

21:30.906 --> 21:32.506
Yeah.

21:33.406 --> 21:37.306
I told you, ain't nobody
trying to smoke herb no more.

21:39.146 --> 21:41.116
This is where the money's at.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.056
How much?

21:48.066 --> 21:50.306
Ten bucks a vial.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.336
And don't smoke that shit, trust me.

21:52.426 --> 21:53.426
Once it gets in your system,

21:53.436 --> 21:54.662
you ain't never getting it out.

21:54.686 --> 21:56.036
You still got your pager?

21:56.506 --> 21:58.096
NYPD been crackin' down.

21:58.206 --> 21:59.616
We changed your number.

21:59.626 --> 22:00.966
I have to let Carlito know.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.386
He got arrested.

22:02.606 --> 22:04.396
Had money and vials on him, too.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.206
He's fucked.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.266
I'm putting Iggy in the parks.

22:08.426 --> 22:10.526
I want you in Manhattanville and Harlem.

22:10.546 --> 22:13.686
I've only ever done the
parks and the piers.

22:14.316 --> 22:16.016
I-I'm not ready for the hood.

22:16.116 --> 22:19.326
Don't pussy out on me now.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.126
You'll be working with my street team.

22:22.146 --> 22:24.706
Tyrone's the lookout, he'll
screen the buyers beforehand.

22:24.766 --> 22:26.086
Jamal's the money man.

22:26.096 --> 22:28.546
He'll get the cash, give you the okay.

22:45.746 --> 22:47.146
What happens if I get caught?

22:48.086 --> 22:49.626
Don't get caught.

22:56.686 --> 22:58.846
- I didn't do nothing.
- Yes, you did.

23:00.506 --> 23:03.566
Get him. Get him.

23:11.586 --> 23:13.176
Hey, Martinez.

23:13.276 --> 23:15.092
You know, the next time an
officer wants to speak to you,

23:15.116 --> 23:16.326
don't resist.

23:16.346 --> 23:17.926
Now get the fuck outta here.

23:28.546 --> 23:30.336
Oh, yo, Papi, what the fuck happened?

23:30.366 --> 23:31.806
The cops showed up.

23:31.846 --> 23:34.126
I got rid of the stash, though,
before they snatched me.

23:34.406 --> 23:35.866
All right.

23:35.966 --> 23:37.106
Listen, I'm-a gonna need you

23:37.126 --> 23:38.926
to stay off the streets
for a little while.

23:39.036 --> 23:41.596
- I got nowhere else to go.
- I got you, bro.

23:41.606 --> 23:43.326
You can stay at my place.

23:53.286 --> 23:54.606
Elektra?

23:55.986 --> 23:57.396
Like the advertisement

23:57.406 --> 23:58.986
in the Village Voice said,

23:59.086 --> 24:00.926
"Don't worry, you'll find me.

24:00.946 --> 24:03.246
Miss Elektra stands out in a crowd."

24:06.606 --> 24:09.006
I generally prefer to
meet gentlemen friends

24:09.026 --> 24:11.306
for some fine dining at
Windows of the World.

24:11.346 --> 24:13.486
I've come to this place
before to meet the girls.

24:13.546 --> 24:15.136
It's safer...

24:15.186 --> 24:16.786
unless someone sees me come in.

24:16.866 --> 24:19.046
- So you've done this before?
- Yes,

24:19.086 --> 24:21.746
but, uh, none of them looked like you.

24:21.826 --> 24:23.246
That's for certain.

24:23.346 --> 24:25.046
Are you married, Mr. Bockol?

24:25.126 --> 24:27.366
Joe. No.

24:27.486 --> 24:28.726
I was.

24:28.746 --> 24:30.546
She passed about ten years ago.

24:30.606 --> 24:32.666
Accident on our boat off Montauk.

24:32.686 --> 24:33.986
So you have a boat?

24:34.096 --> 24:36.306
God damn, you are beautiful.

24:36.406 --> 24:38.226
Brandy Alexander.

24:38.326 --> 24:40.416
Two, please.

24:40.426 --> 24:42.626
What kind of business are you in, Joe?

24:42.666 --> 24:45.036
I work at, uh, Drexel Burnham.

24:45.136 --> 24:48.446
We do leveraged buyouts... junk bonds.

24:48.466 --> 24:49.706
So you're rich?

24:49.726 --> 24:52.146
You get right to the point.

24:52.246 --> 24:53.926
I just want to make sure
that we're not wasting

24:53.946 --> 24:55.206
each other's time.

24:55.216 --> 24:57.326
I love a good negotiation.

24:57.346 --> 24:58.536
You first.

24:58.546 --> 25:01.046
I will need an apartment,
fully furnished,

25:01.156 --> 25:03.626
nothing south of 60th or
east of Third Avenue.

25:03.686 --> 25:06.126
I will know that I'm loved
when I receive gifts,

25:06.226 --> 25:08.026
expensive ones.

25:08.106 --> 25:11.366
I also expect a weekly
allowance in cash.

25:11.446 --> 25:13.776
And only after I feel looked after,

25:13.786 --> 25:16.606
will I even consider
a kiss on the cheek.

25:18.036 --> 25:20.186
I am a lady, after all.

25:20.206 --> 25:22.136
Of course.

25:22.236 --> 25:24.236
That all sounds reasonable.

25:24.346 --> 25:26.896
I assume you'll also need a car service

25:26.906 --> 25:28.726
to come collect you for our dates?

25:28.746 --> 25:32.016
Oh, Joe, we're going
to get along so well.

25:32.116 --> 25:33.846
I can tell.

25:34.016 --> 25:36.466
- Are you ready for my terms?
- Shoot.

25:36.506 --> 25:38.496
You have to look this good

25:38.506 --> 25:40.506
every time I see you.

25:40.826 --> 25:44.566
Mm. And I like a dark color

25:44.586 --> 25:46.326
on your fingers and toes.

25:46.366 --> 25:47.996
Even in the summer months?

25:48.006 --> 25:49.526
Never change your perfume,

25:50.346 --> 25:53.166
it's already driving
me crazy in my pants.

25:53.566 --> 25:56.466
And no other men, ever.

25:56.586 --> 25:59.226
I despise a nighttime color in July,

26:00.566 --> 26:02.876
but I suppose we must
both give a little.

26:02.906 --> 26:05.046
This is a negotiation, after all.

26:05.146 --> 26:06.366
One more thing.

26:08.286 --> 26:10.406
Not every time,

26:10.426 --> 26:14.026
but once in a while when we have sex,

26:14.126 --> 26:16.286
I want you to urinate on me.

26:16.326 --> 26:18.256
Everybody's got a thing, I guess. Right?

26:18.266 --> 26:20.586
I like it when you can aim, you know?

26:20.606 --> 26:21.996
I'm sorry.

26:22.096 --> 26:23.446
I can't do that.

26:23.506 --> 26:25.506
- Have you ever tried?
- No.

26:25.586 --> 26:28.606
I mean, I cannot do what you're asking.

26:29.006 --> 26:31.326
I am a full woman.

26:31.406 --> 26:34.006
Oh.

26:39.116 --> 26:41.226
Kind of messed up for you

26:41.246 --> 26:44.126
not to say that in your ad.

27:00.666 --> 27:03.546
Girl, I am done.

27:03.706 --> 27:05.666
- You ain't the only one, bitch.
- Ugh.

27:06.046 --> 27:09.086
Vodka soda for her, please.

27:09.206 --> 27:11.806
I'm dead-ass serious about
starting my own house.

27:11.916 --> 27:14.046
How are you gonna do that?
With what money?

27:14.066 --> 27:15.776
I ain't got much, but it's enough.

27:15.886 --> 27:18.806
Look at what broke-ass Blanca
did, with just two pennies.

27:18.846 --> 27:21.876
It takes more nerve than it
does coin to start a house.

27:21.886 --> 27:23.086
And it pays off.

27:23.266 --> 27:26.526
Blanca's already an
up-and-coming legendary mother.

27:26.566 --> 27:28.686
Well, you got the nerve
part, that's for sure.

27:28.696 --> 27:31.686
I need to be in a house where
I can express who I am,

27:31.696 --> 27:35.796
not be the expressions
of someone's delusions.

27:35.906 --> 27:37.686
I want my freedom.

27:39.546 --> 27:41.346
And I want you to come with me.

27:41.766 --> 27:43.776
We could be co-mothers,

27:43.876 --> 27:47.086
joining forces like business women.

27:47.126 --> 27:48.446
Just think about it.

27:48.546 --> 27:50.406
Nobody's ever done that before.

27:50.426 --> 27:53.616
The children would gag.

27:53.666 --> 27:55.326
I like the sound of this.

27:55.426 --> 27:57.186
We can take Cubby and Lemar,

27:57.206 --> 27:59.376
and bring in new girls

27:59.386 --> 28:01.416
that will elevate our status...

28:01.426 --> 28:02.506
classy girls.

28:02.526 --> 28:04.516
Yes, no hood rats like
in Blanca's house.

28:04.526 --> 28:07.766
- Ugh.
- We got to be all refined and shit.

28:07.866 --> 28:09.666
What about that girl you work with?

28:09.766 --> 28:11.386
She's always serving looks

28:11.406 --> 28:14.206
and she got access to some
of the freshest clothes.

28:14.246 --> 28:15.956
- Veronica.
- Uh-huh.

28:15.966 --> 28:17.286
Not a bad idea.

28:17.326 --> 28:18.706
And Aphrodite.

28:18.716 --> 28:20.006
She's the only one that can come

28:20.026 --> 28:21.726
for Elektra in realness.

28:21.766 --> 28:24.426
We're gonna need a voguer,
'cause, uh, you know you can't.

28:24.486 --> 28:25.786
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

28:25.886 --> 28:27.286
Okay.

28:27.366 --> 28:31.106
Florida, that bitch can
vogue the house down.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.146
Yes.

28:32.166 --> 28:34.046
- Okay!
- All right.

28:34.126 --> 28:36.126
- We're gonna need a name.
- Mm.

28:36.206 --> 28:39.416
How about The House of Fabulousity?

28:39.426 --> 28:42.226
Uh-uh. That is too gay.

28:48.246 --> 28:49.906
I got it.

28:50.346 --> 28:53.246
The House of Ferocity.

28:53.406 --> 28:54.446
Bitch.

28:54.506 --> 28:55.716
Yes.

28:55.816 --> 28:57.846
The House of Ferocity.

28:57.946 --> 28:59.716
Cheers.

29:09.066 --> 29:10.796
Ah.

29:10.896 --> 29:12.866
Mmm.

29:19.876 --> 29:22.806
Oh. How long you gonna go
without speaking to me?

29:24.946 --> 29:26.746
Look, I get it.

29:26.846 --> 29:28.186
Y-You're mad at me.

29:29.446 --> 29:31.266
Please talk to me.

29:31.326 --> 29:33.716
I'm not mad about the
situation. I'm sad.

29:33.816 --> 29:35.326
Papi...

29:35.806 --> 29:37.626
was my friend.

29:42.586 --> 29:44.146
I'm sorry.

29:45.006 --> 29:46.406
I know you felt like

29:46.426 --> 29:48.072
you were supposed to
be honest with Blanca.

29:48.096 --> 29:50.296
I just wish you hadn't been.

29:51.566 --> 29:53.186
I'm not mad.

29:55.746 --> 29:57.806
Well, I'm fucking pissed off.

29:57.906 --> 29:59.326
Say what you need to say.

29:59.426 --> 30:01.676
What you did was so disrespectful.

30:01.786 --> 30:03.386
What happened to street code, huh?

30:03.506 --> 30:04.986
You snitched on him with the quickness.

30:05.006 --> 30:06.176
You didn't even think twice

30:06.186 --> 30:07.856
before throwing him
under the bus, Ricky.

30:07.956 --> 30:09.256
That's not what happened.
You weren't there.

30:09.266 --> 30:10.962
- You don't know.
- What I do know is

30:10.986 --> 30:12.872
that one of his own family
members turned on him,

30:12.896 --> 30:14.366
and now he's back on the streets.

30:14.426 --> 30:17.166
Anything happens to him,
it's gonna be your fault.

30:17.186 --> 30:18.796
I never wanted this to happen.

30:18.896 --> 30:20.866
I got scared that Blanca was gonna

30:20.966 --> 30:23.736
kick me out if she found
out I lied to her.

30:23.836 --> 30:25.966
I can't go back to
sleeping on a bench again.

30:26.076 --> 30:28.086
And I never wanted that for Papi.

30:28.166 --> 30:30.186
Please forgive me.

30:31.006 --> 30:32.506
Please.

30:32.546 --> 30:34.946
I blame you and Blanca for this.

30:35.046 --> 30:37.716
Y'all broke up our family.

30:42.086 --> 30:43.686
I loved my mother,

30:45.126 --> 30:47.046
but she wasn't exactly
a great role model.

30:47.056 --> 30:49.216
She let my brother walk all over her.

30:50.626 --> 30:53.306
I always told myself I
would be a tough mother

30:53.326 --> 30:55.436
when I had my own kids,
but I'm not so sure

30:55.446 --> 30:57.066
that was the right way to be.

30:57.806 --> 30:59.136
How do you do it?

30:59.236 --> 31:02.606
How do you support and
challenge your kids?

31:02.646 --> 31:04.516
Well, with all due respect,

31:04.526 --> 31:05.766
I don't think I'm the person

31:05.776 --> 31:07.876
you want to have that conversation with.

31:07.976 --> 31:09.956
I don't have any children of my own.

31:09.986 --> 31:11.526
But you have your students,

31:11.706 --> 31:13.606
and they respect you.

31:13.766 --> 31:16.816
Last time we spoke, you
were pretty hard on me,

31:16.826 --> 31:19.746
and told me the truth even
when I didn't want to hear it.

31:19.756 --> 31:21.146
Well...

31:22.566 --> 31:24.226
now I want to hear it.

31:24.866 --> 31:27.006
Well, you made a choice.

31:27.796 --> 31:30.566
And only time will tell
if it was the right one.

31:30.626 --> 31:33.796
But you did what you thought
was best for your family.

31:33.806 --> 31:35.836
To protect them.

31:35.946 --> 31:38.746
If it were me, I would
have done the same thing.

31:38.846 --> 31:41.286
Selling drugs is a crime.

31:41.306 --> 31:44.186
You allow this one offense
to go unpunished,

31:44.206 --> 31:47.046
who knows how serious
the next one will be?

31:47.866 --> 31:49.406
You're upset

31:49.426 --> 31:52.726
because you have
compassion and integrity...

31:52.826 --> 31:56.406
important qualities to
possess as a parent.

31:56.426 --> 31:58.126
Don't change.

31:58.506 --> 32:00.126
Hmm?

32:02.046 --> 32:03.926
They may not grasp the basis

32:03.936 --> 32:05.446
for your decision in the moment,

32:05.486 --> 32:07.406
but years from now, they will,

32:07.426 --> 32:09.676
and you will have earned their respect.

32:10.026 --> 32:11.846
That I know to be true.

32:14.606 --> 32:16.706
Thank you for this.

32:18.326 --> 32:21.026
For giving me some of your
time and your advice today.

32:22.626 --> 32:24.156
Any time.

32:35.346 --> 32:37.306
The category is...

32:37.406 --> 32:41.506
Intergalactic Best Dressed...

32:41.526 --> 32:43.555
Bizarre!

32:52.926 --> 32:54.676
Water grapefruit,

32:54.686 --> 32:57.106
water gingerbread man,

32:57.186 --> 33:00.146
and totally out of

33:00.226 --> 33:04.206
his mind!

33:04.286 --> 33:05.426
Judges, your thoughts.

33:05.516 --> 33:08.746
Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

33:08.786 --> 33:11.606
The all-seeing,

33:11.626 --> 33:13.376
all-knowing,

33:13.386 --> 33:17.696
Twizzler-licorice realness on top.

33:17.706 --> 33:20.286
She is coming.

33:20.346 --> 33:23.346
I don't know what she's invoking,

33:23.386 --> 33:27.546
but I am totally spellbound.

33:27.576 --> 33:29.646
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

33:29.706 --> 33:31.826
- It's just overwhelming.
- Yeah.

33:31.966 --> 33:34.476
Are all the people in here, they...

33:34.576 --> 33:36.486
Are they girls like you?

33:36.566 --> 33:39.646
Baby, there are no girls like me.

33:39.746 --> 33:41.646
Stay here. Let me go get you a drink.

33:41.756 --> 33:43.006
Okay.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.626
A double.

33:52.806 --> 33:55.196
Ooh. You are what you eat.

33:55.296 --> 33:58.196
Dipsy Doodle, big bitch thing.

33:58.206 --> 33:59.986
That's a bold choice, bitch.

34:00.006 --> 34:03.176
And I love you for it, honey.

34:08.676 --> 34:10.846
Must be tourist season.

34:10.906 --> 34:13.106
No. I'm... I'm with someone.

34:14.315 --> 34:15.666
I'm...

34:20.106 --> 34:22.295
She is poured into that latex.

34:23.466 --> 34:26.146
And I love whatever's
going on under there.

34:26.166 --> 34:28.136
It is steaming hot.

34:28.146 --> 34:29.496
I love you, girl.

34:30.146 --> 34:31.985
Twirl, twirl, twirl.

34:36.326 --> 34:38.426
Dance, bitch.

34:38.436 --> 34:40.846
Twirl, twirl, twirl.

34:41.146 --> 34:45.216
I'd hate to see your children
nightmares look like.

34:45.315 --> 34:48.366
You that white boy that's
taking care of Miss Angel.

34:48.406 --> 34:50.936
Got her fixed up in an
apartment and everything.

34:50.946 --> 34:52.326
Are you a friend of hers?

34:52.426 --> 34:53.686
I'm Stan.

34:53.826 --> 34:55.226
I'm Summer.

34:55.326 --> 34:56.456
Like the season.

34:56.565 --> 34:58.286
No, sweetheart.

34:58.296 --> 35:00.266
The season only comes once a year.

35:00.366 --> 35:02.236
I prefer to come every night.

35:02.686 --> 35:04.966
When you get bored with her,

35:05.206 --> 35:08.406
and you're looking for a
new girl to look after,

35:08.506 --> 35:10.376
- you come asking for Summer.
- Uh-uh.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.406
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

35:12.606 --> 35:16.046
Uh, mm, time to stroll on
back to your corner, bitch.

35:21.386 --> 35:23.356
Maybe we should go.

35:23.456 --> 35:25.226
Well, you got to see me work first.

35:25.326 --> 35:28.166
- Maybe next week?
- Please, baby?

35:28.206 --> 35:30.326
It'll mean so much to me.

35:30.426 --> 35:32.126
Come on.

35:32.206 --> 35:35.146
I'll tuck you in a corner
somewhere nobody'll find you.

35:38.366 --> 35:40.086
Come on.

35:46.046 --> 35:47.706
I'm terrified!

35:54.616 --> 35:55.916
You nailed it.

35:55.926 --> 35:57.386
Thanks.

35:58.426 --> 36:00.426
Girl!

36:03.026 --> 36:05.506
I got a magazine and got a trophy.

36:05.526 --> 36:08.166
Let's sit for a sec.

36:08.266 --> 36:10.586
I got...

36:12.236 --> 36:14.436
Sorry.

36:14.926 --> 36:16.566
You didn't like it?

36:17.086 --> 36:18.506
No.

36:18.606 --> 36:20.376
It just didn't like me.

36:22.826 --> 36:24.866
I'm never gonna fit
in a place like that.

36:25.006 --> 36:26.566
You don't have to come.

36:26.686 --> 36:29.046
We can go get salads.

36:30.326 --> 36:32.226
Or stay at home.

36:32.886 --> 36:35.606
Or go see movies.

36:36.366 --> 36:38.296
The balls are not my whole life.

36:38.396 --> 36:40.426
They're a huge part of it.

36:42.496 --> 36:44.066
So is my office.

36:45.406 --> 36:47.336
So are my kids.

36:49.086 --> 36:51.206
We've been in a bubble

36:51.766 --> 36:53.906
this whole time we've been together.

36:54.866 --> 36:56.616
And I thought the secrecy

36:56.626 --> 36:57.946
was the thing holding us back,

36:57.966 --> 37:02.256
but maybe it was what was
keeping us together.

37:02.356 --> 37:04.316
I don't fit in anywhere.

37:17.306 --> 37:19.826
You thought living on
the fringes of society

37:19.926 --> 37:22.276
was gonna be some kind
of picnic and roses?

37:22.376 --> 37:25.476
I just thought it would be
easier than being a fraud.

37:25.646 --> 37:28.566
That's 'cause you're a white
boy from the suburbs.

37:28.666 --> 37:32.666
I just wanted a taste of what you have.

37:34.326 --> 37:36.356
One moment

37:36.456 --> 37:38.416
of being true

37:38.526 --> 37:40.705
in my whole goddamn life.

37:46.526 --> 37:48.366
But I can't.

37:52.086 --> 37:54.166
I do love you.

38:03.826 --> 38:05.386
Hi.

38:07.356 --> 38:09.356
How you been?

38:12.926 --> 38:14.926
Look, I know you're pissed.

38:15.106 --> 38:16.666
Kicking you out was harsh, and...

38:16.786 --> 38:18.906
it's been tearing me up,

38:19.026 --> 38:20.786
but I did it for the good of the house.

38:20.806 --> 38:22.026
I was real messed up about it.

38:22.046 --> 38:24.266
I'm sorry, and I want
to make it up to you.

38:24.366 --> 38:26.516
I want you to come back home,
but you got to promise me

38:26.536 --> 38:27.976
you're not gonna sell drugs no more.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.626
You know I got arrested the other day?

38:30.886 --> 38:32.806
I was lucky I didn't have nothing on me.

38:32.826 --> 38:34.826
All I could think about
was your voice in my head

38:34.866 --> 38:37.476
saying, "Don't make me
your one phone call."

38:39.266 --> 38:40.986
I'm not dealing drugs no more.

38:42.246 --> 38:43.846
Papi, that's great.

38:49.196 --> 38:51.986
We'll have a celebratory
dinner to welcome you back.

38:52.066 --> 38:53.196
Tomorrow night.

38:53.206 --> 38:54.702
I'll have Damon and Ricky
collect your stuff.

38:54.726 --> 38:56.096
I don't need to come back home.

38:56.106 --> 38:57.346
I got new mothers now.

38:57.406 --> 38:59.336
What? Who?

38:59.436 --> 39:00.566
Us.

39:04.046 --> 39:05.606
You joined The House of Abundance?

39:05.646 --> 39:06.686
Abundance?

39:06.696 --> 39:07.866
Girl, please.

39:07.906 --> 39:10.806
That name is as old as
Elektra's lace fronts.

39:10.906 --> 39:14.286
We are The House of Ferocity.

39:14.316 --> 39:15.726
You're joking me, right?

39:15.746 --> 39:17.546
Oh, we're pretty damn serious.

39:17.586 --> 39:19.426
Even got a cute walkup in Harlem.

39:19.526 --> 39:21.046
And unlike you,

39:21.066 --> 39:23.906
we won't throw our children
away on the streets like trash.

39:23.926 --> 39:26.046
But we will have them run errands.

39:26.066 --> 39:27.946
Go inside and fetch me a beverage?

39:27.986 --> 39:30.846
I need to hydrate before
I read this bitch.

39:32.086 --> 39:33.766
You're just using him to get back at me.

39:33.826 --> 39:35.406
Oh, we're using him

39:35.506 --> 39:38.306
to grab our takeout,
to iron our clothes,

39:38.406 --> 39:40.206
to massage our tired feet.

39:40.316 --> 39:42.526
And he's happy to do it.

39:42.586 --> 39:44.366
And he snags trophies.

39:44.486 --> 39:45.756
Bitch, and I thought we was cool.

39:45.766 --> 39:47.326
I don't owe you anything.

39:47.366 --> 39:48.546
I told you:

39:48.556 --> 39:50.886
you are not the only one with dreams.

39:50.926 --> 39:53.586
If it's the last thing I do,

39:54.446 --> 39:56.326
I will get him back as an Evangelista.

39:56.426 --> 39:58.716
Get ready to work your
fingers to the bone, bitch.

39:58.726 --> 40:00.706
Let's go before we get fleas.
