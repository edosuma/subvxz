Ah!

01:05.966 --> 01:09.134
Cleveland, we're only gonna
be on the cruise for a week.

01:09.136 --> 01:10.302
I really don't think
it's necessary

01:10.304 --> 01:11.937
to throw out everything
in the fridge.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.206
Maybe you forgot about
the last time

01:14.208 --> 01:16.608
we left unattended food
in the house.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.043
(crying)

01:18.045 --> 01:19.144
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

(sniffs)
It wasn't my fault!

01:21.048 --> 01:22.981
It-it... it was
an accident.

01:22.983 --> 01:25.184
(crying):
I'm sorry.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.119
No!
Wait!
(gunshot)

01:27.121 --> 01:29.788
Cleveland, that
did not happen.

01:29.790 --> 01:30.989
Oh, Donna.

01:30.991 --> 01:35.127
When the imagination dies,
can the soul be far behind?

01:35.129 --> 01:38.330
Federline just DM'd me
on my Twitter.
Sick!

01:38.332 --> 01:40.299
Well, it was bound to
happen sooner or later,

01:40.301 --> 01:41.633
dressed the way you are.

01:41.635 --> 01:42.634
No, fool!

01:42.636 --> 01:43.869
He sent me a message.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.004
There's something on TV
we need to see!

01:47.373 --> 01:49.308
TV ANNOUNCER:
We interrupt this program

01:49.310 --> 01:50.442
to bring you
an urgent weather report.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.977
(news theme playing)

01:51.979 --> 01:53.479
Good evening.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.614
I'm Dwayne Meighan the news.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.483
Time for run or take covers!

01:57.485 --> 02:01.086
Max the Weather Dog has
prediction hurricane approach

02:01.088 --> 02:03.322
will had becoming fast approach

02:03.324 --> 02:06.325
on Stoolbend greater area
at this time.

02:06.327 --> 02:09.027
This hurricane name Flozell.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.797
Oh, finally! A black hurricane.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.499
Big, large wind blow,

02:13.501 --> 02:16.034
and-and the rain
had be come soon.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.137
Buckets full all wet.

02:18.139 --> 02:21.673
For longer detail
we have Larvell, my friend.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.009
Larvell, my friend?

02:24.011 --> 02:26.145
So, this is wild, man.

02:26.147 --> 02:28.981
What I heard was,
due to global warming,

02:28.983 --> 02:31.617
the storm's gonna be here
for a while,

02:31.619 --> 02:35.020
then in Quahog
about in like a half-hour,

02:35.022 --> 02:36.922
then supposedly after that,

02:36.924 --> 02:40.025
it'll go to <i>American Dad</i> town.
Dwayne?

02:40.027 --> 02:41.493
Thanks you, Larvell.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.095
Please remember viewers,

02:43.097 --> 02:44.930
every person and individuals

02:44.932 --> 02:48.667
advised to leave and ejacuate
Stoolbrend greater area

02:48.669 --> 02:50.669
until further notice something

02:50.671 --> 02:52.704
okay, come on home.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.373
Stay dries.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.642
Sweet pies and category fives!

02:56.644 --> 02:59.011
Kids, we are blowing town now!

02:59.013 --> 03:01.113
This is what we trained for!

03:01.115 --> 03:02.548
Go, go, go!

03:12.125 --> 03:13.525
(slap; horse neighs)

03:15.161 --> 03:16.662
(shredder whirs)

03:16.664 --> 03:18.797
Nobody's going anywhere!

03:18.799 --> 03:20.666
But there's a hurricane
a-coming!

03:20.668 --> 03:21.934
Are you out of your mind?

03:21.936 --> 03:23.101
Trust me, Junior.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.103
This "hurricane"
as they're calling it,

03:25.105 --> 03:27.339
is just overblown media hype,

03:27.341 --> 03:30.042
like Swine flu
or Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

03:30.044 --> 03:32.010
Besides, when was the last time

03:32.012 --> 03:34.947
a hurricane ever did
any real damage to anything?

03:34.949 --> 03:36.448
And no one say Katrina.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.252
See? We'll be fine.

03:40.254 --> 03:42.854
(wind howls, rain pelting)

03:42.856 --> 03:44.823
Okay, thanks for calling.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.192
(phone beeps off)
Well, everyone,
I've got some bad news.

03:47.194 --> 03:50.329
Fox won't let us do
the Joseph Gordon-Levitt joke.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.264
Aw.
Aw, man;
that was funny.

03:52.266 --> 03:53.865
But he's so
terrible.
Typical.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.368
Apparently he's doing a big
summer movie for them,

03:56.370 --> 03:58.036
and they don't want us
making fun of him.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.006
Oh, and the cruise
has been canceled

04:01.008 --> 04:02.140
because of the hurricane.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.142
No, oh...
SPF-this!

04:04.144 --> 04:05.510
All that waxing
for nothing

04:05.512 --> 04:07.012
All that waxing
for nothing.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.047
Oh, baby,
I'm so sorry.

04:09.049 --> 04:12.017
I know how much you wanted to
see Florida from a distance.

04:12.019 --> 04:15.020
It's the only humane way
to experience it.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.122
Sorry, kids.
Maybe next year.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.690
Aw, man. I've been working out

04:18.692 --> 04:20.425
for weeks to get pool ready.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.560
Check it.

04:22.695 --> 04:25.197
(grunts, laughs)

04:25.199 --> 04:29.034
I'm friends with Roger Clemens'
wife's doctor. (kisses)

04:29.036 --> 04:32.104
I was going to hook-up
with a sexy Cuban towel boy.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.039
And it wouldn't be
cheating on Federline,

04:34.041 --> 04:35.007
because the Internet says

04:35.009 --> 04:37.676
sex doesn't count
if it happens in water.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.011
That's true, by the way.

04:39.013 --> 04:41.013
Oh, I know.
(growling):
Oh...?

04:41.015 --> 04:43.782
(sighs)
I guess we'll just go unpack.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.953
No! That's just what
the suitcases want.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.122
Look, if we can't
go on the cruise,

04:50.124 --> 04:53.125
then we'll just have the cruise
right here in the house!

04:53.127 --> 04:56.028
House cruise!
(all cheer)

04:56.030 --> 05:00.098
<i>(The Love Boat</i> theme music
plays)

05:15.448 --> 05:17.215
(music stops)
All right,

05:17.217 --> 05:19.318
what else do you do
on a boat?
Well, let's see:

05:19.320 --> 05:21.019
you throw up from seasickness,

05:21.021 --> 05:22.788
throw up from too much rum,

05:22.790 --> 05:24.623
throw up from food poisoning...

05:24.625 --> 05:25.657
Food!

05:25.659 --> 05:27.726
To the all-you-can-eat buffet!

05:29.295 --> 05:30.429
(all gasp)

05:30.431 --> 05:31.797
Where'd the food go?

05:31.799 --> 05:33.999
Look, clearly someone
threw it all out.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.467
Let's not point fingers.

05:35.469 --> 05:38.136
I'm sure whoever I am
feels bad enough.

05:38.138 --> 05:41.173
No biggie; I'll just
run down to the market.

05:42.375 --> 05:44.276
(kiss; wind howls)

05:44.278 --> 05:47.646
(Cleveland screams three times)

05:47.648 --> 05:49.548
(bang on door;
doorbell rings repeatedly)

05:49.550 --> 05:51.850
(panting)

05:51.852 --> 05:54.286
So... not gonna make it
to the market.

05:54.288 --> 05:56.988
Maybe we should have
evacuated, Cleveland.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.924
Why didn't you listen to the TV?

05:58.926 --> 06:01.159
The TV always knows what's best!

06:01.161 --> 06:02.194
Okay, fine.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.962
We'll see what it says now.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.964
Outside wind you can see

06:05.966 --> 06:08.934
sideways blow rainy condition.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.036
Streets had been closed,

06:11.038 --> 06:14.940
and businesses with the boards
on window protect glass.
(clank)

06:14.942 --> 06:16.308
Bad weather.
(plunk)

06:16.310 --> 06:19.978
For additional inflammation
here goes Mayor Box,

06:19.980 --> 06:22.114
from undisclosed location

06:22.116 --> 06:24.516
at Flamingo Hilton, Las Vegas.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.085
And this hurricane is, uh,
pretty (bleep) serious.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.087
It's a category four
or some (bleep).

06:29.089 --> 06:31.857
So, if you didn't evacuate when
we (bleep) told you to,

06:31.859 --> 06:33.992
then stay inside until
the (bleep) passes,

06:33.994 --> 06:36.094
or you'll probably (bleep) die.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.429
Box out.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.031
(wind howling)

06:41.434 --> 06:44.035
(grunts)

06:44.037 --> 06:46.204
Food... food... hungry...

06:46.206 --> 06:49.040
food... There's nothing here!

06:49.042 --> 06:51.109
Donna, how could you
have let this happen?!

06:51.111 --> 06:53.011
Me?! You threw
out all the food!

06:53.013 --> 06:55.180
I just cleaned out
the refrigerator!

06:55.182 --> 06:57.015
Why is the pantry empty?

06:57.017 --> 06:58.683
Don't you ever
go to the market?!

06:58.685 --> 07:01.987
Okay, first of all,
stop calling it "the market."

07:01.989 --> 07:04.289
You're not a white woman
in 1956.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.024
It's calleda "grocery store."

07:06.026 --> 07:08.794
And second,
I go every single day

07:08.796 --> 07:10.162
on my way home from work.

07:10.164 --> 07:11.263
Every day?

07:11.265 --> 07:12.531
That's... right.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.033
You go to The Stool:
I go to Kroger's.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.602
I have some free wine,
see my friends

07:17.604 --> 07:19.971
and pick up 24 hours
worth of food.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.007
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

07:22.009 --> 07:26.044
Only the elderly and Artie Lange
buy food one day at a time.

07:26.046 --> 07:29.981
Cleveland, it is the only
time I get to myself.

07:29.983 --> 07:33.618
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to the bathroom.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.787
And leave me all
by my lonesome?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.856
(sighs)
Okay, come on.

07:37.858 --> 07:38.957
Yay...!

07:38.959 --> 07:40.592
(squeaking)

07:40.594 --> 07:41.793
(wind howls)
(man groans)

07:41.795 --> 07:43.094
(shutters flapping)

07:43.096 --> 07:45.230
(lightning crackles,
thunder cracks)

07:46.799 --> 07:47.999
We're all gonna die...!

07:48.001 --> 07:49.301
(Rallo and Roberta scream)

07:49.303 --> 07:51.002
Everybody calm down!

07:51.004 --> 07:52.704
Let's all join hands

07:52.706 --> 07:55.207
and ask God to protect us
from the storm.

07:56.175 --> 07:58.276
Dear Lord... uh...

08:01.147 --> 08:02.347
Junior, what are you doing?!

08:02.349 --> 08:04.683
Get over here and pray
with your family!

08:04.685 --> 08:06.084
No, thank you.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.653
But the storm!
Yeah, I don't
think praying

08:08.655 --> 08:10.522
is going to make
the storm go away.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.691
You don't think
God's going to help us?!

08:12.693 --> 08:14.860
Nope. I don't believe in God.

08:14.862 --> 08:15.927
(lightning crackles,
thunderclap)

08:15.929 --> 08:17.128
ALL:
What?!

08:17.130 --> 08:19.297
I don't believe in God.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.298
(thunderclap)

08:20.300 --> 08:22.467
You should not say such things,

08:22.469 --> 08:24.970
boy visiting
from down the street!

08:24.972 --> 08:26.371
(thunderclap)
Okay, he's mine!

08:26.373 --> 08:27.739
You know that!

08:31.043 --> 08:32.477
(thunder booming, wind whipping)

08:32.479 --> 08:34.045
(yelling):
Junior, how can you

08:34.047 --> 08:35.814
not believe in God?!

08:35.816 --> 08:38.517
What?
I said, "How can you..."

08:38.519 --> 08:40.285
You know what?
Let's go in the kitchen.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.753
(raging winds, then silence)

08:41.755 --> 08:42.921
There we go.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.923
Now, how can you
not believe in God?

08:44.925 --> 08:47.025
Well, I started
questioning things

08:47.027 --> 08:49.361
when Mom said Jesus forgave her

08:49.363 --> 08:51.530
after her affair
with Mr. Quagmire.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.765
It just seemed too easy.

08:53.767 --> 08:57.435
So, after a while, I decided
to not take Journey's advice,

08:57.437 --> 09:00.472
and I <i>did</i> stop believin'.
(giggles)

09:00.474 --> 09:03.141
So, you're an athe... an athe...

09:03.143 --> 09:04.976
I can't even say the word!

09:04.978 --> 09:07.379
(bangs window)
Atheist.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.114
No, I'm not.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.016
Atheism is a religion, too.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.018
And thosepeople are the worst.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.687
You remember Brian Griffin
back in Quahog?

09:15.689 --> 09:17.923
The dog?
Yeah.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.859
Remember what an insufferable
d-bag he was about it?

09:20.861 --> 09:24.296
Of course I do, son, but
Christianity makes sense:

09:24.298 --> 09:26.298
a virgin had God's baby,

09:26.300 --> 09:29.367
who then grew up to be murdered
by the (clears throat) Romans,

09:29.369 --> 09:32.671
so you and I could be forgiven
for Eve eating that apple

09:32.673 --> 09:34.439
she got from the talking snake.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.708
Three days later,
Jesus rose from the dead

09:36.710 --> 09:39.945
to tell everyone he was coming
back someday to fight the Devil;

09:39.947 --> 09:42.013
then he flew up
to his mansion in Heaven

09:42.015 --> 09:44.683
where he sits in judgment
of the gays!

09:44.685 --> 09:46.618
How can you not believe that?!

09:46.620 --> 09:49.955
Just don't.
But this is a
Christian home!

09:49.957 --> 09:51.690
Then how come
we never go to church?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.959
Church is for those
in need, Junior.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.127
You don't go to the doctor
when you're healthy.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.929
And now
there's a hurricane.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.665
Miss Donna, why do you
believe in God?

10:00.667 --> 10:02.534
I'm a black woman in the South.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.136
That's it.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.005
I'll be in my room.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.039
(thunder crashing)

10:08.041 --> 10:10.175
Cleveland, do something
about him!

10:10.177 --> 10:12.210
All right, let
me pray on it.

10:13.179 --> 10:17.182
(whistling breath, snoring)

10:17.184 --> 10:20.151
(meowing, snoring, meowing)

10:20.153 --> 10:22.621
(sighs)
I'll handle this.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.489
I've converted all
my friends at school,

10:24.491 --> 10:27.158
and I'm pretty close
to breaking Mrs. Lowenstein.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.261
Man, can you imagine
if I turned a Jew?

10:30.263 --> 10:32.330
Wow.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.665
CLEVELAND JR.:
Ha!

10:33.667 --> 10:35.967
I finally beat you,
you stuffed animal!

10:35.969 --> 10:37.702
(knocking on door)
Hey, Junior.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.104
You mind if I come in?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.205
Be my guest.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.474
I heard what you
said downstairs.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.376
Heartbreaking stuff, man.

10:44.378 --> 10:45.877
It got me thinking about

10:45.879 --> 10:47.946
how much you and I
have in common.
Really?

10:47.948 --> 10:48.947
Mm-hmm.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.782
I used to be just like you.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.817
Lost. No direction.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.653
I was a real troublemaker.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.988
Then one day,
I pushed things too far.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.358
Drew on the wall with a crayon
after Momma told me not to.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.160
(gasps)
Oh, no!

11:02.162 --> 11:04.496
That was the day
my luck ran out.

11:04.498 --> 11:08.266
Got put in a time-out--
ten to 15-- mandatory minimum.

11:08.268 --> 11:12.037
That's hard time for a kid,
time I'll never get back,

11:12.039 --> 11:13.805
so I prayed
for forgiveness,

11:13.807 --> 11:17.108
and Jesus entered my heart
and changed my life.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.277
It was divine
intervention.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.479
You drew on the wall
the next day.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.647
In the name of the Lord.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.049
I'm talking about faith.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.951
I believe that the man
who created the entire universe

11:26.953 --> 11:29.921
knows my name
and cares what happens to me.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.289
Do you know
what that is?

11:31.291 --> 11:33.291
Narcissism?

11:33.293 --> 11:36.127
That boy's
as stubborn as a--

11:36.129 --> 11:38.196
what do you call that thing
that's like a little horse?

11:38.198 --> 11:39.197
A pony?

11:39.199 --> 11:40.465
Are you serious?

11:40.467 --> 11:41.966
A baby horse.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.201
CLEVELAND JR.:
A mule.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.137
Junior-- we have
to save Junior.

11:46.139 --> 11:49.340
Time to break out
the big guns.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.009
(thunder cracks)

11:51.011 --> 11:53.311
CLEVELAND (singsongy):
<i>Oh, Junior.</i>

11:53.313 --> 11:54.546
(organ playing)

11:54.548 --> 11:57.315
Hey, son.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.683
I was just sitting here,

11:58.685 --> 12:01.319
playing this old organ
I dragged up from the basement,

12:01.321 --> 12:03.421
and thinking about the Lord.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.823
Something to do.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.959
Oh, Junior, you kids today
have so many distractions,

12:07.961 --> 12:09.994
with your iPods
and your Furbys

12:09.996 --> 12:12.330
and your Classmates.com.

12:12.332 --> 12:16.167
You probably don't even
realize how cool Jesus is,

12:16.169 --> 12:17.669
but let me tell you, son.

12:17.671 --> 12:19.003
Give me a beat.

14:32.104 --> 14:34.105
What were we thinking,

14:34.107 --> 14:37.809
doing a huge production number
with no food in the house?

14:37.811 --> 14:40.044
Stupid, stupid.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.113
I'm so hungry.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.550
Ugh, oh, that's nasty.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.517
(spits)

(groaning)

14:51.957 --> 14:53.958
Dumb fern.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.093
Don't eat that.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.828
Hey, Momma,
I know I've been

14:56.830 --> 14:58.963
off the boob
for a few years now,

14:58.965 --> 15:01.499
but you think maybe you could
work up a little something

15:01.501 --> 15:02.934
for old time's sake?

15:02.936 --> 15:05.837
I'm sorry, baby, but these
are just for show now.

15:05.839 --> 15:07.772
The only thing they
produce is stares

15:07.774 --> 15:09.474
from Asian men
at the bank.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.009
We're going to starve to death.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.277
(sobbing)

15:12.279 --> 15:14.812
Hey, where's Junior,

15:14.814 --> 15:17.448
and why isn't he in here trying
to eat one of us?

15:17.450 --> 15:19.484
I bet he's hiding
food in his room.

15:19.486 --> 15:20.785
Of course.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.621
Now, maybe this is just
the severe hunger talking,

15:23.623 --> 15:26.491
but let's get
that bloated son of a bitch

15:26.493 --> 15:28.092
and rip his arms off!

15:28.094 --> 15:31.029
(all screaming)

15:31.031 --> 15:32.797
(gasping)

15:32.799 --> 15:36.334
Junior, how could you hoard food
from your own family?!

15:36.336 --> 15:37.602
What?

15:37.604 --> 15:38.937
I'm not hoarding food.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.171
I'm rationing it.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.040
I don't know the difference!

15:42.042 --> 15:43.942
Look, I knew
the storm was coming

15:43.944 --> 15:45.710
because I'm the only one
in the house

15:45.712 --> 15:49.981
who pays attention to the news,
so I stocked up on essentials.

15:49.983 --> 15:53.017
I took everyone's BMI
and daily caloric intake

15:53.019 --> 15:56.988
and rationed enough food for
each of us to eat for four days.

15:56.990 --> 15:57.956
Nerd.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.791
I care about
you, okay,

15:59.793 --> 16:03.027
and you come in here and
accuse me of hoarding?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.631
You know what?

16:06.633 --> 16:07.865
If you're so hungry,

16:07.867 --> 16:10.501
why don't you just pray
for some damn food?

16:10.503 --> 16:11.502
(all gasp)

16:11.504 --> 16:12.937
How dare you
mock the Lord

16:12.939 --> 16:15.807
in the middle of a natural
disaster he created!

16:15.809 --> 16:19.043
And then deny food
to your starving family!

16:19.045 --> 16:21.179
(thunderclap)
You betrayed us,
Junior.

16:21.181 --> 16:26.150
May God bring his wrath
upon thee!

16:26.152 --> 16:27.652
(thunder booming)

16:31.957 --> 16:32.991
(wind gusting)

16:32.993 --> 16:36.794
(grunting and sputtering)

16:36.796 --> 16:38.663
He's being waterboarded
by nature.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.931
What do we do?

16:39.933 --> 16:43.034
(straining):
I-I can't get him out.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.003
The tree's too heavy.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.038
(à la Walter Cronkite):
And that's the way it is.

16:47.040 --> 16:51.542
Friday, May 19, 1978.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.810
Oh, no.

16:52.812 --> 16:55.113
He thinks
he's Walter Cronkite again.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.815

17:19.272 --> 17:20.972
What are you doing?

17:20.974 --> 17:23.007
My phone's not working
'cause of the storm,

17:23.009 --> 17:25.076
so I'm journaling
my tweets.

17:26.011 --> 17:27.478
Everyone, grab onto the tree

17:27.480 --> 17:29.113
and see if we can lift it.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.815
Not you, Junior.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.550
Yeah, step back,
heathen.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.119
But...
But nothing. This is your fault.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.120
My fault?

17:36.122 --> 17:37.121
How is it my fault?

17:37.123 --> 17:39.791
You got some bad mojo
going on, brother.

17:39.793 --> 17:42.360
This is what you get
when you make God mad.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.962
No, this is what you get
when you ignore the warnings

17:44.964 --> 17:47.665
of the National Weather
Service like a dumbass

17:47.667 --> 17:50.034
and think you can
ride out a hurricane!

17:50.036 --> 17:54.038
And so Vietnam
and hippies and Watergate

17:54.040 --> 17:56.874
and braless low hangers.

17:56.876 --> 17:59.043
Just back off, Junior.

Junior, my boy.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.464
Come here, son.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.698
He sounds bad.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.266
How are we going
to get him out?

18:22.268 --> 18:24.669
We've done everything
we can, Junior.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.038
We're just going to have
to put it in God's hands.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.640
That's a pretty good idea
because God is doing

18:29.642 --> 18:33.678

but that's what faith is:

18:39.219 --> 18:41.018
standing in the face
of adversity

18:41.020 --> 18:43.955
and believing that everything's
going to be okay.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.790
Well, excuse me
for not believing

18:45.792 --> 18:49.093
in things you can't
touch, see, or measure.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.963
Junior, Han Solo didn't
believe in the Force,

18:51.965 --> 18:54.031
but he didn't think
Luke Skywalker was

18:54.033 --> 18:55.600
an idiot
for believing in it.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.667
But the Force...

18:56.669 --> 18:58.603
Is what, an unseen presence

18:58.605 --> 19:01.139
from which one draws
strength and inspiration?

19:01.141 --> 19:04.208
How is that any different
from what I'm talking about?

19:05.944 --> 19:08.846
You just blew my mind,
Miss Donna.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.314
Life is hard, Junior,

19:10.316 --> 19:12.150
and when reason
and logic run out,

19:12.152 --> 19:14.252
all you have left
is faith.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.120
Believing that something
greater than myself

19:16.122 --> 19:17.255
is watching
over my family

19:17.257 --> 19:19.357
gets me
through the rough patches.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.092
It gives me peace.

19:21.094 --> 19:23.494
Why would I choose
not to believe that?

19:23.496 --> 19:24.629
(branch cracking)

19:24.631 --> 19:25.763
Cleveland!

19:25.765 --> 19:26.998
Aah, ant on the branch!

19:27.000 --> 19:28.533
There's an ant on the branch!

19:28.535 --> 19:29.800
He's red!

19:29.802 --> 19:31.035
(frantic blowing)

19:35.707 --> 19:37.542
Hey, Lord,
how you doing?

19:37.544 --> 19:39.310
Some weather, huh?

19:39.312 --> 19:42.380
I know Cleveland and I don't
always get along, but he's...

19:42.382 --> 19:43.981
Hey, my Frisbee--
it's in the tree.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.816
I got my Frisbee back.

19:45.818 --> 19:46.918
Thanks, God.

19:46.920 --> 19:47.919
Perfect.

19:47.921 --> 19:49.287
Now maybe
without the extra weight

19:49.289 --> 19:51.355
of that Frisbee, I can do this.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.759
(straining)

19:54.761 --> 19:56.294
Aah, hernia!

19:56.296 --> 19:59.697
And Lord, I ask again
that you hear our prayers,

19:59.699 --> 20:01.599
and if it be your will...

20:01.601 --> 20:02.600
(gasps)

20:02.602 --> 20:03.801
Mama, did you see that?

20:03.803 --> 20:04.969
The tree moved.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.837
God heard
our prayers.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.640
(grunting)

20:09.642 --> 20:12.510
Junior.

20:12.512 --> 20:15.513
Daddy, I'm so
glad you're okay.

20:15.515 --> 20:16.814
If you died,
I don't think

20:16.816 --> 20:18.516
they'd let me live
here anymore.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.017
Probably not.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.786
Junior, I know
it's been a rough day

20:21.788 --> 20:23.187
and I don't want
to embarrass you,

20:23.189 --> 20:26.791
but once again, as with
everything else in your life,

20:26.793 --> 20:29.460
God has made you look
like a fool.

20:29.462 --> 20:30.261
Huh?

20:30.263 --> 20:31.963
God answered our prayers

20:31.965 --> 20:34.532
and got Cleveland out
from under the tree.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.133
But...
Don't you see, son?

20:36.135 --> 20:37.168
God does exist.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.303
He was here tonight
in this room.

20:39.305 --> 20:41.339
You just witnessed
a miracle.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.441
Well, not really.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.843
It was science,
basic engineering.

20:45.845 --> 20:46.944
I did it.

20:46.946 --> 20:50.648
But God showed you
how to build that contraption.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.949
No, I learned that in school.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.751
God built the school.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.353
Immigrants built the school.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.988
Christian immigrants.

20:56.990 --> 20:58.422
I'm out.

20:59.358 --> 21:00.358
(groans)

21:00.360 --> 21:01.459
(sneezes)

21:01.461 --> 21:02.660
God bless you.
