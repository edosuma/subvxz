I was a pretty socially awkward

I love the linking rings,
it's one of my favorite.

03:10.570 --> 03:12.700
It's just there's a few things
with it that I think could be

03:12.700 --> 03:13.430
better.

03:13.430 --> 03:15.400
And so I would like to show
you guys my version

03:15.400 --> 03:16.400
of the linking rings.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.700
But instead of using those
props, I'd like to use a

03:18.700 --> 03:21.230
borrowed object from someone
in the audience.

03:21.230 --> 03:24.870
So if you have a $1 bill on you
either in your wallet

03:24.870 --> 03:26.600
or in your purse,
if you wouldn't mind pulling it

03:26.600 --> 03:29.000
out now, that would be great.

Now I'll let you know that I'm
going to be destroying your

03:31.870 --> 03:33.670
dollar bill during this trick.

03:33.670 --> 03:36.100
So I don't want you to have to
pay to see a magic trick, so

03:36.100 --> 03:38.800
I'm going to trade you my bill
for yours.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.630
You, sir, do you mind
if I borrow your bill?

03:40.630 --> 03:41.330
- You can have it.

03:41.330 --> 03:42.270
- You got it. Okay. Cool.

03:42.270 --> 03:44.730
Now I have to ask you,
is there anything sentimental

03:44.730 --> 03:46.100
about this bill?

03:46.100 --> 03:46.770
- Nothing.

03:46.770 --> 03:48.230
- You don't mind if I destroy
it?

03:48.230 --> 03:51.400
And then you can keep mine but
before I commit to destroying

03:51.400 --> 03:53.530
your bill, if you wouldn't mind
looking into that camera right

03:53.530 --> 03:56.100
there and just say, I accept
responsibility.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.300

Oh, thumbs up.

03:58.300 --> 03:58.970
Thumbs up works.

03:58.970 --> 03:59.630
Thank you so much, sir.

03:59.630 --> 04:00.370
Appreciate it.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.100
- He accepts responsibility.

04:01.100 --> 04:02.570
- Give him a round of applause
for volunteering.

04:02.570 --> 04:06.070
That's great.

04:06.070 --> 04:08.200
Now this is a smaller trick.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.430
It's kind of a close-up trick
since I can't use the big rings.

04:10.430 --> 04:12.470
So if you, Penn and Teller,
wouldn't mind joining me on

04:12.470 --> 04:13.900
stage, that would be awesome.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.570
Thank you.

04:15.570 --> 04:17.029
Penn, if you wouldn't mind
sitting here.

04:17.029 --> 04:17.930
- You want me in this chair?

04:17.930 --> 04:18.600
- Yes please.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.600
- Okay. Okay.

04:19.600 --> 04:20.370
- Teller, good to see you.

04:20.370 --> 04:21.170
Please sit here.

04:21.170 --> 04:22.370
Thank you so much.

04:22.370 --> 04:25.270
Now since this is already
a unique bill this gentleman

04:25.270 --> 04:27.730
currently volunteered, I'm gonna
make it a little bit more

04:27.730 --> 04:30.630
unique by asking you guys
to sign the bill.

04:30.630 --> 04:31.300
Just like that.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.170
Penn, if you wouldn't mind
signing there.

04:33.170 --> 04:34.230
Thank you.

04:34.230 --> 04:37.700
And Teller, if you wouldn't mind
signing on that line.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.000
Thank you so much.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.670
Now this bill, you could argue,
that now is worth more than

04:42.670 --> 04:44.770
a dollar with your guys'
autographs on there.

04:44.770 --> 04:45.770
- At least a buck-01.

04:45.770 --> 04:47.230
- Exactly.

04:47.230 --> 04:49.700
So I'm gonna take this a step
further now.

04:49.700 --> 04:52.400
And actually, if you thought,
like, writing on money

04:52.400 --> 04:55.470
was illegal,
I'm going to take this to the

04:55.470 --> 04:57.900
hardcore level of tearing it.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.930
This trick is intense so far,
right?

05:00.930 --> 05:03.130
So I'm gonna tear it right down
the middle.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.030
Just like this.

05:04.030 --> 05:05.970
Now, Teller, if you wouldn't
mind holding to this half

05:05.970 --> 05:08.570
for me, I'm gonna have you do
a few things with that half

05:08.570 --> 05:09.670
in just a moment.

05:09.670 --> 05:12.170
But first, I'm gonna ask you to
fold it in half.

05:12.170 --> 05:14.700
If you could go ahead and do
that, that would be great.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.630
So what we're going to do is
actually form the two rings

05:17.630 --> 05:19.630
for the trick instead of using
the giant silver ones.

05:19.630 --> 05:22.570
So we're gonna tear out the
center of each of these halves.

05:22.570 --> 05:25.030
So if you don't mind just
tearing out a circle,

05:25.030 --> 05:27.800
leaving about a 1/2 inch border
around the bill and I'll do the

05:27.800 --> 05:29.700
same thing here with my half.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.200
Exactly.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.430
Just kind of like that,
that deep.

05:34.430 --> 05:35.400
Perfect.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.730
So there you go.

05:36.730 --> 05:37.970
Get rid of my middle.

05:37.970 --> 05:41.330
Now what I'm gonna do is take
your half and I'm going to try

05:41.330 --> 05:43.730
to create the illusion that
they're linked.

05:43.730 --> 05:45.200
If that makes any sense.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.670
So it's gonna use origami,
and kind of misdirection,

05:47.670 --> 05:50.470
and a little bit of an optical
illusion.

05:50.470 --> 05:54.200
So if I hold them just straight
like this,

05:54.200 --> 05:58.300
you'll see that they start
to look like they're linked.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.070
But that's just an optical
illusion.

06:00.070 --> 06:03.300
The origami in magic starts to
look a lot better whenever you

06:03.300 --> 06:05.800
open one of the bills,
and then whenever you open the

06:05.800 --> 06:10.000
other one, they really look like
they're linked.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.930
- [cheering]
- Pretty cool.

06:14.930 --> 06:17.400
Now--Thank you. Thank you.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.700
Now obviously this is just
an optical illusion.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.400
You know they're not actually
linked.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.700
So Teller, if you mind, just
holding up one finger for me.

06:23.700 --> 06:24.370
Just like that.

06:24.370 --> 06:25.770
The longer you stare
at the illusion,

06:25.770 --> 06:29.430
the more you start to realize
that they are not actually

06:29.430 --> 06:30.970
linked.

06:30.970 --> 06:32.570
Thank you.

06:32.570 --> 06:35.270
Thank you.

06:35.270 --> 06:38.270
So I'm gonna try to do this one
more way but make this different

06:38.270 --> 06:39.970
than anything you've seen
before.

06:39.970 --> 06:42.530
But in order to do that,
I'm gonna hand you the bills

06:42.530 --> 06:43.500
in a moment.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.430
But it's because of the legal
issues with this trick

06:46.430 --> 06:48.300
and destroying money
on television,

06:48.300 --> 06:50.830
Teller, I'm actually gonna need
you to accept responsibility

06:50.830 --> 06:51.630
for these.

06:51.630 --> 06:53.630
So Penn, if you don't mind
saying into the camera,

06:53.630 --> 06:55.330
Teller accepts responsibility.

06:55.330 --> 06:58.030
- Teller accepts responsibility
for all Federal crimes done

06:58.030 --> 06:58.770
within the next two hours.

06:58.770 --> 07:06.030
[laughter]
Anywhere in the U.S.A.

07:06.030 --> 07:06.700
- Perfect.

07:06.700 --> 07:07.700
Amazing.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.070
So now that we've got that out
of the way,

07:10.070 --> 07:12.530
I'm gonna try this one final
time for you.

07:12.530 --> 07:15.270
So you can see the two bills
here and on the count of three.

07:15.270 --> 07:18.730
One, two, three.

07:18.730 --> 07:22.130
They link.

07:22.130 --> 07:25.970
Now what makes this link
slightly different is if--

07:25.970 --> 07:29.400
Teller, do you mind grabbing
right here with your right hand?

07:29.400 --> 07:31.830
At this point in the trick,
instead of unlinking them,

07:31.830 --> 07:33.970
you can examine everything.

07:33.970 --> 07:36.670
And that's the end of the trick.

07:36.670 --> 07:37.870
Thank you.

07:37.870 --> 07:39.800
- Blake Vogt,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.900
That was great.

07:40.900 --> 07:44.830
Guys, you can take those back to
your seats so you can continue

07:44.830 --> 07:46.430
examining them.

07:46.430 --> 07:47.830
How good was that,
ladies and gentlemen?

07:47.830 --> 07:49.030
It was out of this world.

07:49.030 --> 07:50.030
- Thank you.

07:50.030 --> 07:54.030
- Especially bearing in mind
you had Penn and Teller,

07:54.030 --> 07:57.130
two of the keenest minds and two
of the sharpest eyes in magic,

07:57.130 --> 07:58.670
staring right at what you were
doing.

07:58.670 --> 08:00.370
So for you to do that in front
of them, you have either got to

08:00.370 --> 08:03.170
be pretty confident about what
you do or just insane.

08:03.170 --> 08:04.730
- Prob--a little bit of both
probably.

08:04.730 --> 08:08.570
- Okay. It seems an especially
brave or foolhardy thing to do

08:08.570 --> 08:10.970
to let them take that away but I
guess that's part of the whole

08:10.970 --> 08:12.470
trick you're playing on them,
is it?

08:12.470 --> 08:13.800
- Yeah. All or nothing,
I guess.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.270
- Okay, so you're being pretty
crafty right now.

08:15.270 --> 08:16.170
- I'm hoping so.

08:16.170 --> 08:17.970
- Let's go to Penn now and find
out what they feel.

08:17.970 --> 08:18.630
- Awesome.

08:18.630 --> 08:19.530
- Penn, your verdict please.

08:19.530 --> 08:22.170
- We know this guy!

08:22.170 --> 08:25.270
And we have seen the work that
this guy can do with a piece

08:25.270 --> 08:26.230
of paper.

08:26.230 --> 08:27.900
We've seen things he's done.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.670
Close-up tricks for us.

08:29.670 --> 08:33.030
And he has shown us afterwards
how he did it.

08:33.030 --> 08:35.900
Maybe not with a lot of
foresight for this show tonight.

08:35.900 --> 08:36.600
Yeah.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.070
- If I would've known I would
have been here, I might've

08:38.070 --> 08:39.000
handled that differently.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.330
[laughter]
- Because he can do anything

08:41.330 --> 08:42.970
with a piece of paper.

08:42.970 --> 08:48.370
And I'll tell you, our eyes and
our fingernails are not good

08:48.370 --> 08:53.030
enough to see how you made
these bills into, essentially,

08:53.030 --> 08:57.500
what ends up being a paper
version of a locking ring.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.500
And then put in our hands.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.970
Which means, not only are your
hands very skillful,

09:02.970 --> 09:05.270
but you also have gonads
the size of Texas.

09:05.270 --> 09:09.800
[laughter]
- We saw a few of the things

09:09.800 --> 09:14.730
you were doing because there's
no way in this trick to put in

09:14.730 --> 09:16.930
any sort of real misdirection.

09:16.930 --> 09:17.600
- Right.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.500
- Because when you need to do
the dirty work,

09:20.500 --> 09:21.900
we're staring at your hands.

09:21.900 --> 09:22.570
- Right.

09:22.570 --> 09:24.870
- This is just raw skill.

09:24.870 --> 09:28.300
We know what he's doing,
and when he's doing it,

09:28.300 --> 09:31.630
and he just does it so well
that we can't--

09:31.630 --> 09:33.270
we can't see the seams.

09:33.270 --> 09:34.970
But we saw the seams being made.

09:34.970 --> 09:36.830
- So they know what
you're doing.

09:36.830 --> 09:37.500
- Yes, they do.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.170
- You didn't fool them.

09:38.170 --> 09:38.830
- No, I did not.

09:38.830 --> 09:40.530
- Well, you fooled the rest of
us--that was an incredible

09:40.530 --> 09:42.170
performance wasn't it, ladies
and gentlemen?

09:42.170 --> 09:43.670
- He would fool anyone in the
world except us.

09:43.670 --> 09:44.900
- Yeah, but what a great act.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.230
Blake Vogt, ladies and
gentlemen.

09:46.230 --> 09:46.900
- Thank you. Thank you.

09:46.900 --> 09:47.570
- Superb.

09:47.570 --> 09:50.500
Thank you, sir.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.070
We're gonna take a break.

09:52.070 --> 09:54.870
But we will be back with more
magic including a performance by

09:54.870 --> 09:57.270
the legendary Penn and Teller,
so stay close.

♪ ♪

10:15.600 --> 10:17.330
- Welcome back to <i>Fool Us.</i>

10:17.330 --> 10:19.930
Now we like to think that it's a
show that not only entertains,

10:19.930 --> 10:20.970
but makes you think.

10:20.970 --> 10:22.900
You can relax, however,
you don't have to do too much

10:22.900 --> 10:25.230
thinking because Penn and Teller
do all the heavy lifting for us.

10:25.230 --> 10:32.200
While they limber up,
let's meet our next contender.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.530
- I'm Joshua Jay
and I'm from Ohio.

10:35.530 --> 10:39.000
When you're as crazy about magic
as I am, you see everything

10:39.000 --> 10:40.430
through the lens of magic.

10:40.430 --> 10:44.370
Everything that I do, everything
that I read and that I watch is

10:44.370 --> 10:46.470
fodder for magic tricks.

10:46.470 --> 10:49.230
The thing I love about magic is
the same thing that I love about

10:49.230 --> 10:49.930
movies.

10:49.930 --> 10:52.530
So many different ways to tell
a story.

10:52.530 --> 10:56.200
Alfred Hitchcock, Stephen King,
many others, these people are

10:56.200 --> 10:59.830
great storytellers and they
would make great magicians.

10:59.830 --> 11:02.500
I like to try and transport
the audience.

11:02.500 --> 11:06.400
I wanna take them into my story
and then give them this magical

11:06.400 --> 11:07.270
payoff.

11:07.270 --> 11:10.270
I feel like magic is like a game
of chess between the magician

11:10.270 --> 11:11.630
and the audience.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.470
And the end game is pure
entertainment.

11:13.470 --> 11:14.400
Pure astonishment.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.300
To see something incredible.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.300
That's what you go for.

11:21.170 --> 11:24.670
- Now one of the all-time magic
greats, Mr. Lance Burton,

11:24.670 --> 11:27.670
said of this next performer,
"this kid is going places."

11:27.670 --> 11:30.170
Well, we're thrilled our stage
is one of these places.

11:30.170 --> 11:32.930
With a randomly selected member
of our audience to help him,

11:32.930 --> 11:35.000
will you please welcome
Joshua Jay.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.030
- Thank you.

11:36.030 --> 11:38.530
Thank you.

11:38.530 --> 11:42.530
It's--
It's an honor to be performing

11:42.530 --> 11:45.970
here for Penn and Teller and for
all of you and it's a challenge,

11:45.970 --> 11:46.630
right?

11:46.630 --> 11:47.700
To try and fool these guys.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.000
Penn and Teller.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.600
But not as challenging
as the last show I did.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.970
I was trying to fool
a 7-year-old girl.

11:54.970 --> 11:57.570
You see, this girl came up to me
and she wanted to see a trick

11:57.570 --> 12:00.530
and I realized she was blind.

12:00.530 --> 12:03.370
And I thought, that's a really
powerful moment.

12:03.370 --> 12:05.870
And it is a challenge because
magic is visual.

12:05.870 --> 12:07.200
It's for the eyes.

12:07.200 --> 12:11.530
If I were gonna fool her,
I'd have to fool her mind.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.930
So I'm gonna show you
what I showed her...

12:13.930 --> 12:15.170
with your help.

12:15.170 --> 12:19.770
Now I can't have you pick a card
if you couldn't see because you

12:19.770 --> 12:21.300
wouldn't know which card you
picked.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.770
Even if I could get your hand
to the deck and have you pick

12:23.770 --> 12:25.970
a card out,
you wouldn't know which one

12:25.970 --> 12:26.700
you were looking at.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.300
So I've got a better way.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.670
Hold out your hand and put your
other hand on top.

12:30.670 --> 12:34.000
52 possibilities between
your hands.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.070
I want you to do it like this.

12:35.070 --> 12:36.030
First think of the number.

12:36.030 --> 12:36.700
Do you have a number?

12:36.700 --> 12:37.370
- Yeah.

12:37.370 --> 12:39.370
- And now I want you to think
of the suit.

12:39.370 --> 12:40.100
- Okay.

12:40.100 --> 12:40.770
- Now you have a card.

12:40.770 --> 12:41.970
A number and a suit.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.600
And this is perfect 'cause
he knows the card in his head

12:44.600 --> 12:46.400
but of course Penn and Teller
don't know it and none of you

12:46.400 --> 12:47.130
know it.

12:47.130 --> 12:48.870
And you all need to know
the card.

12:48.870 --> 12:52.170
Now if you whispered the card,
you'd accuse me of listening.

12:52.170 --> 12:56.530
So I've got a perfect way for
Todd to code the card to all of

12:56.530 --> 12:59.570
you and you'll be--
You will know the card

12:59.570 --> 13:00.300
but I won't.

13:00.300 --> 13:00.970
Here's how it works.

13:00.970 --> 13:03.130
I'll blindfold myself
and I'll turn away.

13:03.130 --> 13:06.630
And when I do, what I'd like you
to do, Todd, is I want you

13:06.630 --> 13:09.570
to deal the value of your card
in a facedown pile.

13:09.570 --> 13:12.030
So we'll get a close up
in a second on Todd's hands.

13:12.030 --> 13:14.800
And if you thought of three,
you'll go, one, two, three.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.970
One by one.

13:15.970 --> 13:18.300
And put the deck on top
when you're done.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.700
Deal as quietly as you can so
you don't think I'm listening.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.870
I will turn away.

13:21.870 --> 13:23.970
The audience will tell me
when you're done.

13:23.970 --> 13:24.730
Go ahead and go.

13:24.730 --> 13:28.730
Deal that value of your card in
a facedown pile and when you're

13:28.730 --> 13:30.870
done put the deck on top.

13:30.870 --> 13:33.730
[applause]
It's done?

13:33.730 --> 13:34.400
- It's done.

13:34.400 --> 13:38.670
- Now all of you know the value
of your card except for me.

13:38.670 --> 13:39.330
Which is great.

13:39.330 --> 13:40.170
But you need to know the suit.

13:40.170 --> 13:43.000
So I'll turn away again
and I want you to deal the value

13:43.000 --> 13:44.670
or the suit of your card
like this, if you're thinking

13:44.670 --> 13:47.470
of clubs, deal one down,
and put the deck on top.

13:47.470 --> 13:50.670
If you were thinking of hearts,
do two cards, one by one.

13:50.670 --> 13:51.370
Deck on top.

13:51.370 --> 13:52.670
Spades would be three.

13:52.670 --> 13:54.000
Diamonds would be four.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.830
Audience will tell me
when you're done.

14:00.830 --> 14:05.400
[applause]
Oh.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.900
Applause for dealing,
I like this crowd.

14:07.900 --> 14:08.830
Okay.

14:08.830 --> 14:11.330
Now the question is
how can I find this card?

14:11.330 --> 14:13.330
'Cause it's the perfect
situation, right?

14:13.330 --> 14:14.330
Todd thought of a card.

14:14.330 --> 14:15.870
He never had to take it out
of the deck,

14:15.870 --> 14:19.300
never had to show it around,
never had to mention it.

14:19.300 --> 14:23.200
But now how can I find a card
for somebody's mind?

14:23.200 --> 14:24.330
And I'll tell you how.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.330
I'm gonna go by feel.

14:26.330 --> 14:29.170
I'm gonna try and feel
for that card.

14:29.170 --> 14:31.230
Go by a feeling that I get.

14:31.230 --> 14:32.300
Todd, you didn't leave, did you?

14:32.300 --> 14:33.200
- Nope. I'm still here.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.970
- That's good.

14:34.970 --> 14:37.900
I'm gonna go--
Oh. Oh.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.630
I'm getting a feeling
on this card.

14:40.630 --> 14:45.600
Todd, did you by any chance
pick..

14:45.600 --> 14:47.830
The 4 of Diamonds?

14:47.830 --> 14:48.700
- That I did.

14:48.700 --> 14:57.200
- [laughs]
[applause]

14:57.200 --> 15:05.130
- Is this card, by any chance,
the 4 of Diamonds?

15:05.130 --> 15:09.500
[applause]
- Nice.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.430
- Thank you.

15:10.430 --> 15:13.230
But I said that this was a
trick, not for the eyes,

15:13.230 --> 15:14.200
but for the mind.

15:14.200 --> 15:19.000
You see, there is no
deck of cards.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.830
This is completely
for your mind.

15:21.830 --> 15:23.970
And I want you to look at
these. Make sure that they don't

15:23.970 --> 15:25.330
come apart, peel apart.

15:25.330 --> 15:26.530
This is a real deck of cards.

15:26.530 --> 15:29.800
In fact, it's my gift you
and I thank you so very much.

15:29.800 --> 15:34.930
[applause]
They're yours.

15:34.930 --> 15:36.370
- Wow.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.330
- Let's hear it again for
Joshua Jay.

15:38.330 --> 15:40.700
[applause]
Josh, come out in the front.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.130
That was phenomenal.

15:42.130 --> 15:43.530
Because I've seen a lot
of card tricks.

15:43.530 --> 15:44.200
- Thank you.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.600
- But I've never seen one
quite like that.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.630
Wasn't that out of this world?

15:46.630 --> 15:47.670
- Thank you very much.

15:47.670 --> 15:49.700
Thank you.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.700
- I know you have a lot of
interest in the history of

15:51.700 --> 15:53.100
magic and the greats that have
come before you.

15:53.100 --> 15:53.770
- I do. Absolutely.

15:53.770 --> 15:56.070
My apartment is like
a mad scientist's lair

15:56.070 --> 15:57.230
of magic stuff.

15:57.230 --> 15:59.930
I have Houdini's straitjacket
that he used, and his handcuffs,

15:59.930 --> 16:01.600
and, like, 4,000 books.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.800
'Cause it's my life, you know,
I mean, this isn't just

16:03.800 --> 16:04.530
what I do here.

16:04.530 --> 16:07.100
I'm thinking about it
and reading about it constantly.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.170
- I'm assuming the
straitjacket is on display.

16:09.170 --> 16:11.300
It's not used for, like, 
<i>Shades of Grey </i> moments at home,

16:11.300 --> 16:11.970
is it?

16:11.970 --> 16:12.630
- No comment on that.

16:12.630 --> 16:13.970
- Okay.

16:13.970 --> 16:16.100
[laughter]
So what was it?

16:16.100 --> 16:17.570
What kicked off your love
of magic?

16:17.570 --> 16:20.000
- My dad showed me a trick when
I was eight years old

16:20.000 --> 16:21.670
and didn't tell me
how it was done.

16:21.670 --> 16:24.230
And the not telling me
how it was done part

16:24.230 --> 16:25.470
was what hooked me.

16:25.470 --> 16:26.630
- And did he ever tell you?

16:26.630 --> 16:27.330
- Never did.

16:27.330 --> 16:28.430
But I figured it out.

16:28.430 --> 16:30.630
So I had a little <i>Fool Us 
</i> at eight years old

16:30.630 --> 16:31.530
in my living room.

16:31.530 --> 16:32.930
- I have my fingers crossed
for you.

16:32.930 --> 16:33.670
Penn, the verdict please.

16:33.670 --> 16:37.800
- Okay, we see a lot of people
come out here and do trick

16:37.800 --> 16:39.000
after trick after trick.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.470
Just machine gun quality
going through that we have

16:42.470 --> 16:43.830
trouble keeping track of.

16:43.830 --> 16:48.870
You did one clearly plotted
trick that used, actually, four

16:48.870 --> 16:51.870
methods that you had to use
to do that.

16:51.870 --> 16:55.730
Your cards, from the very
beginning, were not shuffled and

16:55.730 --> 16:57.470
were not handled by Jonathan.

16:57.470 --> 17:02.230
And we also thought that the
move you had to do at the end

17:02.230 --> 17:05.430
was done absolutely beautifully.

17:05.430 --> 17:07.369
Just gorgeous. Wonderful...

17:07.369 --> 17:08.500
And at a wonderful time--yeah.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.400
- Just so we're closer,
are you saying

17:10.400 --> 17:12.670
that something was switched
or changed out

17:12.670 --> 17:13.329
near the end there?

17:13.329 --> 17:15.670
- There was one moment
when something was--

17:15.670 --> 17:17.200
I'm trying--not trying to say
too much--

17:17.200 --> 17:18.530
but where something was
switched.

17:18.530 --> 17:21.130
But there were four things that
Teller could right down.

17:21.130 --> 17:22.230
And we will show them to you.

17:22.230 --> 17:24.300
- So Josh, if you take a look
at what Teller's worked on--

17:24.300 --> 17:25.300
- Hi, Teller.

17:28.099 --> 17:31.300
[laughter]
That's--

17:31.300 --> 17:33.030
That's not correct.

17:33.030 --> 17:33.700
- Wow.

17:33.700 --> 17:34.930
- Whoa! That's not correct?

17:34.930 --> 17:36.330
- And that's a pretty major
part of it.

17:36.330 --> 17:38.030
- I think I can say,
without giving anything away,

17:38.030 --> 17:41.130
I absolutely did not
do a deck switch.

17:41.130 --> 17:43.270
- You did not do a deck switch?

17:43.270 --> 17:45.270
Well then, I do know what you
did do then.

17:45.270 --> 17:46.330
- Okay.

17:46.330 --> 17:48.770
- If you did not do a deck
switch, then I think--

17:48.770 --> 17:52.170
and I didn't confirm with Teller
on this--but I think there's

17:52.170 --> 17:55.230
another way--
I think you fooled us.

17:55.230 --> 17:56.630
That was the way you did it.

17:56.630 --> 18:01.770
If you didn't do a deck switch,
you fooled us is what you did.

18:01.770 --> 18:02.830
- Why'd you do that?

18:02.830 --> 18:05.600
[laughter]
[overlapping chatter]

18:05.600 --> 18:07.700
- Oh, God. You gave me a heart
attack.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.070
Thank you.

18:09.070 --> 18:10.870
- You might wanna give that to
the young man, there.

18:10.870 --> 18:11.530
- Here you go, sir.

18:11.530 --> 18:12.200
- That's for Joshua.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.500
- There you go.

18:13.500 --> 18:14.230
Beautifully done.

18:14.230 --> 18:16.130
- Oh, my God. Thank you.

18:16.130 --> 18:18.570
- You fooled Penn and Teller.

18:18.570 --> 18:19.230
- Thank you.

18:19.230 --> 18:21.770
- Joshua Jay, ladies and
gentlemen.

18:21.770 --> 18:24.200
So what, that's one successful
fooler.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.500
But can lightning strike twice
in one night?

18:26.500 --> 18:28.830
We'll reveal the shocking truth
when we return.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.530
- Welcome back to <i>Fool Us </i> where
magicians compete to win an

18:48.530 --> 18:51.200
all-expenses paid trip to
perform with Penn and Teller.

18:51.200 --> 18:57.400
That said, it's time to meet
our next contender.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.300
- My name's Levent.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.570
I do comedy magic.

18:59.570 --> 19:03.130
My area of interest is magic
within vaudeville.

19:03.130 --> 19:05.100
We're here right now
in David Copperfield's

19:05.100 --> 19:07.330
Museum and Library
Of The Conjuring Arts.

19:07.330 --> 19:09.770
Let's take a look at what some
of this stuff does.

19:09.770 --> 19:13.330
I will often take an old trick
and just polish it up and give

19:13.330 --> 19:14.600
it a new angle.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.570
But it's still--I'm still
performing, in its core,

19:16.570 --> 19:17.630
the classic trick.

19:17.630 --> 19:19.100
And it's a classic for a reason.

19:19.100 --> 19:20.800
Because it's good.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.930
Ehh, ventriloquism.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.070
This stuff's creepy.

19:25.070 --> 19:28.230
A modern magician learns from
what magicians did in the past.

19:28.230 --> 19:31.730
So how you pay it back is you
teach the magicians of the

19:31.730 --> 19:33.200
future how to do tricks.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.500
So, in other words, you pay the
past back by paying it forward.

19:36.500 --> 19:42.630
[cheers and applause]
- Besides being an accomplished

19:42.630 --> 19:44.870
magician, our next performer
is the curator of David

19:44.870 --> 19:46.600
Copperfield's Museum Of Magic.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.870
So to be here tonight, either
the big guy gave him the night

19:48.870 --> 19:50.230
off or he called in "sick."

19:50.230 --> 19:53.100
Will you please welcome Levent!

19:53.100 --> 19:56.170
- Oh, thank you.

19:56.170 --> 19:57.900
Thank you.

19:57.900 --> 19:58.830
Thank you very much, folks.

19:58.830 --> 19:59.500
Thank you.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.430
Some scarf music please.

20:00.430 --> 20:01.270
Here we go.

20:01.270 --> 20:05.170
One, two, three scarves go here
on the chair that says the word

20:05.170 --> 20:05.870
not.

20:05.870 --> 20:08.430
One, two, three scarves remain
at my fingertips.

20:08.430 --> 20:10.400
Now I'm gonna tie the corners of
these two scarves together

20:10.400 --> 20:11.200
into a knot.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.470
Speaking of the word knot,
if you look on the chair, it

20:13.470 --> 20:15.370
says the word knot but it
doesn't say the word not.

20:15.370 --> 20:17.370
If you look on the other chair,
it says the word not but it

20:17.370 --> 20:18.670
doesn't say the word knot.

20:18.670 --> 20:20.970
So the most important thing to
remember is that you may not

20:20.970 --> 20:22.300
place the knots
where it says not.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.130
And you may only place knots
where it says the word knot.

20:24.130 --> 20:24.830
So watch.

20:24.830 --> 20:27.030
Three handkerchiefs, two knots,
go gentle on the the chair

20:27.030 --> 20:27.800
like that.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.270
Now to confuse your brain cells,
I remove the letter K

20:30.270 --> 20:32.570
from the word knot
and I simply place the letter K

20:32.570 --> 20:33.870
over to the word not.

20:33.870 --> 20:36.430
Suddenly, on the chair, it no
longer says the word knot,

20:36.430 --> 20:38.000
it says the word not,
which means the knots

20:38.000 --> 20:40.030
are not there.

20:40.030 --> 20:40.800
You got it or not?

20:40.800 --> 20:42.530
You get it?

20:42.530 --> 20:43.200
Watch the chair.

20:43.200 --> 20:48.630
Look. Each handkerchief
one at a time.

20:48.630 --> 20:50.500
One.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.270
Two.

20:52.270 --> 20:54.500
Three handkerchiefs.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.170
No knot.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.530
Thank you.

20:56.530 --> 20:57.200
Ah.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.500
You may applaud at will.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.170
Thank you very much.

20:59.170 --> 20:59.870
Thank you.

20:59.870 --> 21:01.100
Come here, Jonathan.

21:01.100 --> 21:04.970
Come here for a second.

21:04.970 --> 21:05.800
Jonathan, watch this.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.230
Can you step onto the stage
right here?

21:07.230 --> 21:08.330
Three handkerchiefs, two knots.

21:08.330 --> 21:09.800
Three handkerchiefs, two knots.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.600
I'm gonna place them right down
there.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.500
I'm gonna remove the letter K.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.130
The word has changed
and knots are gone.

21:14.130 --> 21:17.600
Please give me each handkerchief
one at a time.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.500
- Oh.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.930
- Wow.

21:20.930 --> 21:22.930
- Thank you very much,
Jonathan.

21:22.930 --> 21:24.700
Thank you.

21:24.700 --> 21:28.970
- [murmurs under applause]
- You know--folks, I'll do this

21:28.970 --> 21:30.670
one more time,
but I'll remind you, this

21:30.670 --> 21:32.930
trick only works in the
English-speaking world.

21:32.930 --> 21:35.000
For instance, if this was
Norway, this wouldn't

21:35.000 --> 21:35.730
be the word knot.

21:35.730 --> 21:37.530
In Norwegian, it would be
the word <i>knute.</i>

21:37.530 --> 21:40.200
<i>Knute, </i> which is a sport which
involves a piece of rope,

21:40.200 --> 21:42.800
a reindeer, a lit candle,
and a bottle of whale oil.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.570
And it's illegal in most
countries.

21:44.570 --> 21:47.270
So a trick with one knot--
One knot because the word knot

21:47.270 --> 21:50.000
is singular, it's not plural,
and I don't wanna get the angry

21:50.000 --> 21:50.800
grammarians coming after me.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.430
So watch.

21:52.430 --> 21:54.970
All the magic is done with
the letter K.

21:54.970 --> 21:57.770
Now how many people expected
to see a one K run?

21:57.770 --> 21:58.430
I'm not sure.

21:58.430 --> 21:59.200
But look.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.400
Look. Look.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.530
Boom. It goes right there.

22:03.530 --> 22:08.300
Let's see the handkerchiefs.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.400
No knot.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.070
No knot.

22:11.070 --> 22:12.770
The one knot has disappeared
from this group of

22:12.770 --> 22:13.830
handkerchiefs.

22:13.830 --> 22:15.370
Then I grab this corner here,
and this corner,

22:15.370 --> 22:17.770
and the handkerchiefs on the
chair have tied themselves

22:17.770 --> 22:19.070
as if by magic.

22:19.070 --> 22:21.000
Thank you.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.870
Thank you.

22:22.870 --> 22:24.900
Thank you.

22:24.900 --> 22:27.200
Gonna get rid of half of the
handkerchiefs and I have here,

22:27.200 --> 22:29.170
remaining in my fingers,
we have here the blue

22:29.170 --> 22:31.130
handkerchief, the white
handkerchief, and the red

22:31.130 --> 22:31.800
handkerchief.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.470
I'm gonna show you each one of
these handkerchiefs to be truly

22:33.470 --> 22:34.930
empty and without guile.

22:34.930 --> 22:36.870
Jonathan, please help me
for just one moment.

22:36.870 --> 22:37.530
- Sure.

22:37.530 --> 22:38.930
- I'm gonna pull the
handkerchiefs through your hand.

22:38.930 --> 22:39.630
- Okay.

22:39.630 --> 22:40.400
- Make sure there's no knot.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.070
See that?

22:41.070 --> 22:41.730
Not knot.

22:41.730 --> 22:42.530
- No knot.

22:42.530 --> 22:44.570
The next handkerchief,
white handkerchief.

22:44.570 --> 22:46.300
Pull it through your hand,
no knot.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.700
And finally, the blue
handkerchief--pull it through

22:48.700 --> 22:50.430
your hand--
No knot.

22:50.430 --> 22:53.230
And the most difficult thing
in this entire trick

22:53.230 --> 22:55.270
is hiding the bottle of wine
while handling all the

22:55.270 --> 22:57.600
handkerchiefs just like that.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.000
Ah.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.270
How's it done?

23:00.270 --> 23:01.100
Get a bunny rabbit.

23:01.100 --> 23:03.330
It does all the hard work.

23:03.330 --> 23:05.330
Let's give him a round
of applause--thank you very

23:05.330 --> 23:06.570
much, folks.

23:06.570 --> 23:08.430
Thank you.

23:08.430 --> 23:11.200
Thank you.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.470
Thank you.

23:12.470 --> 23:14.070
- Levent, ladies and gentlemen.

23:14.070 --> 23:14.730
Fabulous.

23:14.730 --> 23:15.470
- Thank you. Thank you.

23:15.470 --> 23:16.500
- Very funny finish as well.

23:16.500 --> 23:17.730
That was incredible.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.930
That was as close to real magic
as I think I've ever sat.

23:19.930 --> 23:20.600
- Well, thank you.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.270
I appreciate it.

23:21.270 --> 23:22.070
- It was really remarkable.

23:22.070 --> 23:24.530
- It's one of the great classic
tricks of magic from vaudeville.

23:24.530 --> 23:25.670
Many versions of it.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.730
And this happens to be my little
version of it.

23:27.730 --> 23:30.800
I study all different kinds
of magic tricks and I try

23:30.800 --> 23:31.970
to bring back old tricks.

23:31.970 --> 23:34.570
Because just because something
is old doesn't mean

23:34.570 --> 23:35.270
that it's bad.

23:35.270 --> 23:37.770
Sometimes, in the arts,
something is old and it's good,

23:37.770 --> 23:38.830
we call it a classic.

23:38.830 --> 23:40.730
And I consider this trick
a classic.

23:40.730 --> 23:42.100
- Let's see if the guys
are getting close.

23:42.100 --> 23:43.130
Penn?

23:43.130 --> 23:48.070
- You know, you do the classic
stuff but I don't think that

23:48.070 --> 23:50.100
gives you enough credit--
- Oh, thank you.

23:50.100 --> 23:53.700
- Because you talked about that
being vaudeville stuff.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.330
That is the Sympathetic Silks.

23:55.330 --> 23:56.000
- Yes.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.130
- And it is a classic of magic
and one that we're aware of

24:00.130 --> 24:00.800
and we study.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.430
But you always add stuff too.

24:03.430 --> 24:04.800
I don't mean just the comedy.

24:04.800 --> 24:08.900
There's also little wrinkles
that made this a brain buster

24:08.900 --> 24:10.100
in a few places.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.730
I think that there was a lot of
sleight of hand in here.

24:12.730 --> 24:13.400
- Yes.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.630
- And then the wonderful thing
in there--

24:15.630 --> 24:16.930
and we love when you do this.

24:16.930 --> 24:20.530
the best thing you can do in
magic is to use multiple methods

24:20.530 --> 24:21.700
to accomplish the same thing.

24:21.700 --> 24:22.370
- That's right. Mm-hmm.

24:22.370 --> 24:23.870
- And there is something
mechanical in there.

24:23.870 --> 24:25.230
I don't wanna say any more
than that.

24:25.230 --> 24:25.900
- Right.

24:25.900 --> 24:27.300
But it's not all sleight of
hand.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.070
So some of it's real clean
sleight of hand.

24:29.070 --> 24:30.400
Some of it's mechanical.

24:30.400 --> 24:34.600
You put those two together, you
really, really do blow minds,

24:34.600 --> 24:35.530
which you did.

24:35.530 --> 24:38.270
We happened to see a couple
of the loads that we knew were

24:38.270 --> 24:39.300
gonna be coming in.

24:39.300 --> 24:40.870
Because we knew we were coming.

24:40.870 --> 24:43.700
Because--that's the bad part
of doing classic magic.

24:43.700 --> 24:44.370
- Right.

24:44.370 --> 24:46.070
- Is we know the rhythms
and know where you're going.

24:46.070 --> 24:49.400
We just loved it but I do think
we have a pretty good idea

24:49.400 --> 24:50.430
of how you did it.

24:50.430 --> 24:51.430
As much as we loved it.

24:51.430 --> 24:52.200
- Well, I appreciate it.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.100
Thank you very much.

24:53.100 --> 24:54.900
- You know, I think the sign--
And you're happy then.

24:54.900 --> 24:56.330
You're convinced
that they do know.

24:56.330 --> 24:57.100
They've busted you.

24:57.100 --> 24:57.930
You didn't fool them?

24:57.930 --> 24:59.270
- I mean, I'm using
sleight of hand.

24:59.270 --> 25:01.270
That's--there's no way--
you can't get away from that.

25:01.270 --> 25:01.930
- Right.

25:01.930 --> 25:02.700
- I'm using sleight of hand.

25:02.700 --> 25:03.370
- And it's beautiful.

25:03.370 --> 25:04.070
- Thank you. Thank you.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.630
- You're not just a sleight of
hand artist--you're probably

25:05.630 --> 25:06.370
the best, I think.

25:06.370 --> 25:07.030
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

25:07.030 --> 25:09.030
- 'Cause that was--the thing
about a true professional is

25:09.030 --> 25:10.770
they make it look so easy you
can't believe anything is going

25:10.770 --> 25:11.430
on.

25:11.430 --> 25:13.070
And that was faultless.

25:13.070 --> 25:13.930
Wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

25:13.930 --> 25:14.830
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

25:14.830 --> 25:17.630
- Just remarkable and beautiful
to watch.

25:17.630 --> 25:18.300
- Thank you.

25:18.300 --> 25:19.270
- Levent, ladies and gentlemen.

25:19.270 --> 25:20.230
The fabulous Levent.

25:20.230 --> 25:22.100
- Thank you. Good-bye.

25:24.070 --> 25:25.770
- For my next trick, I'm about
to show you a few

- Well, it's been an eventful
night here on <i>Fool Us.</i>

25:48.770 --> 25:52.270
One magician has already taken
down the mighty Penn and Teller.

25:52.270 --> 25:55.030
Let's see if lightning can
strike twice as we meet our next

25:55.030 --> 25:56.030
contender.

25:58.770 --> 25:59.830
- My name is Ben Seidman.

25:59.830 --> 26:02.330
I do magic tricks and I live in
Los Angeles.

26:02.330 --> 26:04.100
I wanted to play in a band
for years.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.100
I love playing music.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.070
And I also love acting.

26:06.070 --> 26:07.700
I was an actor growing up.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.030
So I decided, eventually,
of the three things that

26:10.030 --> 26:12.430
I love, I have to choose one
passion.

26:12.430 --> 26:13.830
So I chose magic.

26:13.830 --> 26:16.500
And I really do love what I do.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.970
The hardest part about it
is the travel.

26:18.970 --> 26:21.230
Last year, I did more than
200 shows.

26:21.230 --> 26:23.870
So I was on the road about 95%
of the year.

26:23.870 --> 26:27.030
There was a week this month
where I didn't sleep more

26:27.030 --> 26:28.630
than two hours a night.

26:28.630 --> 26:33.530
It was just do a show, got on a
plane, drive, do a show, repeat.

26:33.530 --> 26:35.870
Everywhere I've gone in my life,
I've moved to get better at

26:35.870 --> 26:37.200
magic.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.070
I'd always been chasing
this high.

26:39.070 --> 26:46.530
And I wouldn't trade it
for the world.

26:46.530 --> 26:48.600
- I've got some good news
for you, guys.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.000
I'm gonna bring out an artiste
from the world of burlesque

26:51.000 --> 26:52.100
for you.

26:52.100 --> 26:54.800
The bad news is, it's a guy and
he left his feathers at home.

26:54.800 --> 26:55.470
Here he is.

26:55.470 --> 26:57.470
Dressed in a shirt and jacket as
nature intended,

26:57.470 --> 26:58.800
it's Ben Seidman.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.870
[applause]
- Thank you.

27:04.670 --> 27:06.930
I feel the same way about you.

27:06.930 --> 27:09.830
It's nice to be in Las Vegas
filming a TV show.

27:09.830 --> 27:13.000
Proof that what happens in Vegas
gets broadcast nationally,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.670
apparently.

27:15.670 --> 27:18.770
Penn, I've got one playing card.

27:18.770 --> 27:19.670
Name a card, Penn.

27:19.670 --> 27:20.700
Any one.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.530
4 of Hearts.

27:25.400 --> 27:28.500
[laughter]
- It would've fooled you,

27:28.500 --> 27:31.700
but I'll move on as planned.

27:31.700 --> 27:32.430
I used to live here.

27:32.430 --> 27:34.970
I lived in Vegas for, like,
five years and this actually

27:34.970 --> 27:35.630
happened to me.

27:35.630 --> 27:38.030
I was walking downtown and I see
a guy.

27:38.030 --> 27:39.970
And he has a manila envelope
and he's jingling it,

27:39.970 --> 27:41.530
asking people for change.

27:41.530 --> 27:43.530
And I walked by him,
I was just kind of in a hurry.

27:43.530 --> 27:44.330
And he yelled at me.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.270
He actually yelled.

27:45.270 --> 27:48.270
He was like, hey aren't you
gonna give me any money?

27:48.270 --> 27:52.030
What, are you not a good
Christian?

27:52.030 --> 27:54.470
No. I'm not.

27:54.470 --> 27:56.730
I'm Jewish.

27:56.730 --> 27:58.800
And I'm not even good at that.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.670
I mean, I was raised Jewish
but I don't really practice.

28:00.670 --> 28:02.800
So I'm Jewish but I don't
practice, which means that my

28:02.800 --> 28:05.270
mom still nags me but when I
pray that she'll stop, nothing

28:05.270 --> 28:07.700
happens.

28:07.700 --> 28:08.570
That was a thinking joke.

28:08.570 --> 28:11.070
Thanks for coming along with me.

28:11.070 --> 28:11.770
But it's true.

28:11.770 --> 28:13.930
Jews are the worst Christians.

28:13.930 --> 28:17.500
[laughter]
Except for one.

28:17.500 --> 28:18.770
One became the best.

28:18.770 --> 28:22.130
[laughter]
It's not me though.

28:22.130 --> 28:22.970
That's Jesus.

28:22.970 --> 28:23.700
I'm Ben Seidman.

28:23.700 --> 28:24.630
Different people altogether.

28:24.630 --> 28:27.970
[applause]
Yeah.

28:27.970 --> 28:32.670
[applause]
Maybe. Just maybe, you're

28:32.670 --> 28:36.330
applauding because you think
I am Jesus.

28:36.330 --> 28:37.170
And maybe I am.

28:37.170 --> 28:38.430
How would you know?

28:38.430 --> 28:42.570
What if Jesus came back but no
one believed him so he went on

28:42.570 --> 28:46.370
TV and tried to fool Penn and
Teller?

28:46.370 --> 28:49.770
But he wasn't successful.

28:49.770 --> 28:52.300
Penn was like, uh, yeah, that's
food coloring and water.

28:52.300 --> 28:53.300
Not wine.

28:53.300 --> 28:58.130
- [laughs]
- And Teller was like...

28:58.130 --> 28:59.900
That would be disappointing
for religious people

28:59.900 --> 29:02.130
and for atheists.

29:02.130 --> 29:03.470
But for very different reasons.

29:03.470 --> 29:06.400
[laughter]
Anyway, I see this guy,

29:06.400 --> 29:08.370
he yells at me, and I wanted
to get mad.

29:08.370 --> 29:10.600
But in that moment, our eyes
met, and we had this, like,

29:10.600 --> 29:12.700
real, like, human moment.

29:12.700 --> 29:14.230
And I just started to feel bad
for him.

29:14.230 --> 29:15.500
He was clearly a nice guy.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.170
He was down on his luck.

29:17.170 --> 29:19.730
And I reached in my pocket,
I took my wallet out, I gave him

29:19.730 --> 29:23.570
the only bill that I had,
which was a $100 bill.

29:23.570 --> 29:25.800
Because I felt bad for him.

29:25.800 --> 29:26.470
And he hugged me.

29:26.470 --> 29:27.430
He was so overjoyed.

29:27.430 --> 29:29.800
And I walked away, I thought,
what a nice guy.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.930
I completely misjudged him.

29:31.930 --> 29:33.870
How long was I talking to him?

29:33.870 --> 29:38.630
And I looked down at my watch,
and my watch was gone.

29:38.630 --> 29:41.200
I don't know how, but this guy
must've somehow managed to pull

29:41.200 --> 29:44.330
my watch off without me even
feeling him do it.

29:44.330 --> 29:47.470
So he took my watch.

29:47.470 --> 29:49.870
Not only--
Not only did he take my watch,

29:49.870 --> 29:52.000
I also distinctly remember
putting my ring on that day.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.030
When I looked down at my finger,
my ring was gone.

29:54.030 --> 29:57.670
So I'm thinking he took my watch
and he also, somehow, managed to

29:57.670 --> 30:00.270
take my ring.

30:00.270 --> 30:02.330
And I reached in my pocket,
grabbed my wallet, remembered

30:02.330 --> 30:04.370
I had given this guy the only
bill that I had.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.800
The $100 bill because I felt bad
for him.

30:06.800 --> 30:07.530
So I'm walking away.

30:07.530 --> 30:09.200
I'm just trying to process
the information.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.930
I'm thinking, did that
really just happen?

30:10.930 --> 30:11.970
He took everything from me.

30:11.970 --> 30:16.570
He took my ring, he took my
watch, he took all of my money.

30:16.570 --> 30:20.330
Sounds like I had a pretty
terrible day, right?

30:20.330 --> 30:22.800
He learned a very valuable
lesson that day.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.400
He learned that you should
never ever try to steal

30:25.400 --> 30:27.070
from a magician.

30:27.070 --> 30:32.330
Because when this guy got home,
he didn't have any of my stuff

30:32.330 --> 30:33.830
at all.

30:33.830 --> 30:36.830
[applause]
Because I still had my ring.

30:42.130 --> 30:43.230
- What?

30:43.230 --> 30:46.030
- I still had my watch.

30:46.030 --> 30:49.230
And I still had all of my money.

30:49.230 --> 30:53.130
[applause]
- Ben Seidman,

30:53.130 --> 30:55.570
ladies and gentlemen.

30:55.570 --> 30:56.230
Great job.

30:56.230 --> 30:58.670
Very funny and a great trick
as well.

30:58.670 --> 30:59.800
That was great, Ben.

30:59.800 --> 31:00.730
- Thanks, Jonathan.

31:00.730 --> 31:02.500
- Now you know how this works,
the guys are gonna sit there,

31:02.500 --> 31:04.170
and they're gonna deliberate,
and we'll have a little chat

31:04.170 --> 31:04.830
out here.

31:04.830 --> 31:05.530
- Yeah.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.230
But Jonathan, I hope--
actually, I hope--

31:07.230 --> 31:08.900
you wouldn't mind, would you?

31:08.900 --> 31:09.670
- Sure. A selfie?

31:09.670 --> 31:10.330
- Yeah, yeah, thanks.

31:10.330 --> 31:11.000
- Sure, let's do that.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.830
- I've always wanted to take a
picture of Penn and Teller while

31:12.830 --> 31:13.770
my arm was around you.

31:13.770 --> 31:19.130
- Okay. Let's--
[mumbling]

31:19.130 --> 31:19.800
- Thanks.

31:19.800 --> 31:20.470
- Should we hug this out?

31:20.470 --> 31:21.130
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

31:21.130 --> 31:21.900
- 'Cause I enjoyed that too.

31:21.900 --> 31:22.570
That was nice moment.

31:22.570 --> 31:23.400
- Well, good, I'm glad.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.270
It was a really good moment.

31:24.270 --> 31:25.200
- How confident are you?

31:25.200 --> 31:26.130
- Oh, you know what?

31:26.130 --> 31:27.730
I--they're really--
they're my heroes.

31:27.730 --> 31:30.230
They were some of my favorite
magicians growing up.

31:30.230 --> 31:31.300
So I don't know.

31:31.300 --> 31:32.570
I respect them so much.

31:32.570 --> 31:34.230
If they enjoyed what I do,
that's what means the most

31:34.230 --> 31:35.030
to me.

31:35.030 --> 31:36.930
- Well, one thing I noticed--
and I'm sure everyone else did,

31:36.930 --> 31:39.470
is just how confident you seemed
out here.

31:39.470 --> 31:40.930
And I know that performing
in front of these guys,

31:40.930 --> 31:42.470
it's nerve-wracking
for most people.

31:42.470 --> 31:44.130
But you seemed cool
and calm as a cucumber.

31:44.130 --> 31:45.800
- Oh, I'm freaking out
on the inside.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.170
[laughter]
- Well, you're disguising it

31:48.170 --> 31:48.830
very well.

31:48.830 --> 31:51.800
Let's find out how much they
know genuinely right now.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.770
Fellas, do you think you've got
it?

31:53.770 --> 31:55.470
- We see a lot of people who
try to cobble something

31:55.470 --> 31:56.730
together.

31:56.730 --> 32:01.400
And watching you do something
that's just a polished, finished

32:01.400 --> 32:03.630
routine is wonderful.

32:03.630 --> 32:07.530
And you might notice, when I say
wonderful, that I'm kind of

32:07.530 --> 32:11.330
underlining the wonder part of
the wonderful 'cause we all

32:11.330 --> 32:14.570
know a wonderful magician
named Tommy Wonder.

32:14.570 --> 32:18.900
You know that Tommy Wonder did a
routine called "The Hold Up".

32:18.900 --> 32:23.600
I much prefer your version
to Tommy Wonder's version.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.930
'Cause Tommy Wonder did not have
the--

32:26.930 --> 32:31.570
His style of comedy was not as
close to my heart as yours is.

32:31.570 --> 32:33.300
But I think that's a wonderful
routine you're gonna wanna do

32:33.300 --> 32:33.970
forever.

32:33.970 --> 32:35.530
And I don't really wanna tear it
apart.

32:35.530 --> 32:36.930
- Awesome, well,
thank you so much, guys.

32:36.930 --> 32:37.770
- Okay. I think it's wonderful.

32:37.770 --> 32:38.470
- It's been a pleasure.

32:38.470 --> 32:39.170
Honestly.

32:39.170 --> 32:40.600
- Well, let me check, Ben.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.200
I wanna check--
as Penn elaborated, you're

32:43.200 --> 32:45.230
fairly confident now
he knows what was going on.

32:45.230 --> 32:46.570
- Yeah. I think so.

32:46.570 --> 32:47.530
- Okay. Can I just check?

32:47.530 --> 32:50.630
You're not actually Jesus
though, are you?

32:50.630 --> 32:52.230
[laughter]
- Wow. Ladies and gentlemen,

32:52.230 --> 32:56.470
let's call him by his codename,
the fabulous Ben Seidman.

32:56.470 --> 32:57.870
Great job. Thank you, Ben.

32:57.870 --> 32:58.530
- Thanks.

32:58.530 --> 32:59.200
- Fabulous.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.600
Ben Seidman.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.630
[applause]
Okay. It's time to catch our

33:03.630 --> 33:06.130
breath, but when we come back,
we may be left breathless after

33:06.130 --> 33:08.300
a trick from our very own
Penn and Teller.

33:08.300 --> 33:10.000
So don't go away, ladies

they have invented, reinvented,

refined, and redefined magic as
we know it, while entertaining

33:34.000 --> 33:36.200
millions over the last 40 years.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.200
They're still doing it better

Here they are.

The fabulous Penn and Teller.

33:47.070 --> 33:50.730
- There's a kind of magic
called Gospel magic.

33:50.730 --> 33:55.370
And Gospel magicians use magic
tricks to proselytize.

33:55.370 --> 33:59.670
Now in 1948, there was a Country
Western hit by Tex Ritter,

33:59.670 --> 34:01.900
called <i>The Soldier's Deck of
Cards,</i>

34:01.900 --> 34:05.700
and the story of that song is
that a soldier is caught in

34:05.700 --> 34:08.830
church with a deck of cards
and his commanding officer says

34:08.830 --> 34:12.400
he'll be court marshaled
for having gambling apparatus

34:12.400 --> 34:13.330
in church.

34:13.330 --> 34:16.330
So we're gonna do an answer song
to <i>A Soldier's Deck of Cards,</i>

34:16.330 --> 34:20.429

You all set?

34:24.199 --> 34:26.800
A while ago, Teller and I
were sitting in the front row

34:26.800 --> 34:32.230
of a lecture by the theoretical
physicist Lawrence Krauss.

34:32.230 --> 34:35.000
Suddenly, Krauss looked down
and said, "Teller!

34:35.000 --> 34:36.730
You've been fiddling
with that deck of cards

34:36.730 --> 34:38.870
since I began speaking.

34:38.870 --> 34:42.270
Do you find me so dull
that you have to amuse yourself

34:42.270 --> 34:45.830
with trivial tricks
and manipulations?"

34:45.830 --> 34:48.300
Teller stood up and addressed
Lawrence and the entire

34:48.300 --> 34:49.630
audience.

34:49.630 --> 34:52.630
"Not at all, Dr. Krauss,"
Teller began.

34:52.630 --> 34:55.230
"I'm listening to every word
you're saying.

34:55.230 --> 34:58.270
I don't carry a pad of paper
or a cell phone, but as

34:58.270 --> 35:02.000
a magician, I always have
my deck of cards with me.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.800
I use that deck and my knowledge
of magic to take notes.

35:06.800 --> 35:10.130
Please allow me to recap
what you've covered so far."

35:10.130 --> 35:12.470
Then, Teller fanned
the cards out.

35:12.470 --> 35:16.330
"You know, Lawrence, you're a
very well known atheist.

35:16.330 --> 35:19.730
As I look over the faces
of the cards, I notice there's

35:19.730 --> 35:22.070
no God among them.

35:22.070 --> 35:24.200
The universe of my deck,
like the universe

35:24.200 --> 35:29.700
of your speech, contains kings,
queens, millions of number

35:29.700 --> 35:33.900
combinations and, well,
even a couple of jokers, but no

35:33.900 --> 35:36.530
God can be found."

35:36.530 --> 35:40.800
Teller motioned to the professor
and Lawrence Krauss, he stood up

35:40.800 --> 35:43.100
right there in the audience.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.870
Teller explained that he would
riffle down the deck

35:45.870 --> 35:49.970
and the professor should yell,
"Stop!," then select a random

35:49.970 --> 35:53.000
particle from the universe
of Teller's deck.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.030
Well, Teller riffled.

35:55.030 --> 35:58.030
Professor yelled...

35:58.030 --> 36:00.370
Teller showed the card
to the professor and to

36:00.370 --> 36:02.430
the entire audience.

36:02.430 --> 36:05.970
It was a 3 of Clubs
that we all promised ourselves

36:05.970 --> 36:07.770
we'd remember.

36:07.770 --> 36:10.470
Teller returned the card
to the deck and handed the deck

36:10.470 --> 36:12.370
to Lawrence to shuffle.

36:12.370 --> 36:15.430
Teller took the fully shuffled
cards back from the professor

36:15.430 --> 36:19.830
and took a quick look at
the random order of the faces.

36:19.830 --> 36:23.130
You know, every random order
contains some intrinsic

36:23.130 --> 36:24.600
qualities.

36:24.600 --> 36:28.700
The four aces always remind me
of the four fundamental

36:28.700 --> 36:30.530
interactions in nature.

36:30.530 --> 36:32.100
The Ace of Diamonds?

36:32.100 --> 36:35.330
That reminds me
of electromagnetism.

36:35.330 --> 36:38.870
And electromagnetism is a force
responsible for practically

36:38.870 --> 36:42.630
all the phenomena encountered
in daily life.

36:42.630 --> 36:46.030
Ordinary matter takes its form
as a result of intermolecular

36:46.030 --> 36:49.500
forces for individual molecules.

36:49.500 --> 36:52.670
The Ace of Diamonds,
electromagnetism, well,

36:52.670 --> 36:55.770
that holds our world together.

36:55.770 --> 37:01.870
[applause]
[continues strumming]

37:01.870 --> 37:06.300
The other force you encounter
in daily life is gravity.

37:06.300 --> 37:10.070
The Ace of Hearts, which
individual particles attract

37:10.070 --> 37:12.930
with a force proportional
to their masses.

37:12.930 --> 37:15.200
And that leaves the strong
interaction and the weak

37:15.200 --> 37:16.170
interaction.

37:16.170 --> 37:19.830
Well the strong force, to me,
that's the Ace of Spades,

37:19.830 --> 37:22.630
and that binds protons
and neutrons together

37:22.630 --> 37:25.000
and the nucleus to the atom.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.830
That leaves a good ol'
weak force, the Ace of Clubs,

37:28.830 --> 37:31.030
which is responsible for
radioactive decay of the

37:31.030 --> 37:35.200
nuclei and hydrogen fusion
of the stars.

37:35.200 --> 37:38.170
Now, some people accept
the Unified Field Theory,

37:38.170 --> 37:41.130
and all these cards
would be of one suit, but until

37:41.130 --> 37:45.670
then, the four suits remind me
of the four fundamental

37:45.670 --> 37:47.400
interactions in nature."

37:47.400 --> 37:50.100
And with that, Teller had thrown
most of the cards in the

37:50.100 --> 37:51.430
audience.

37:51.430 --> 37:54.570
He said, "These few cards
remaining remind me

37:54.570 --> 37:57.130
of the cosmological constant.

37:57.130 --> 38:00.200
Oh, it's an amazing constant.

38:00.200 --> 38:03.900
Even as space gets bigger,
the energy density remains

38:03.900 --> 38:05.500
the same.

38:05.500 --> 38:06.970
Let's measure.

38:06.970 --> 38:10.370
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

38:10.370 --> 38:13.270
You ever try to change
that density by throwing out

38:13.270 --> 38:17.600
one, two, three cards,
the energy density, well,

38:17.600 --> 38:19.000
it still remains.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.600
One, two, three, four,
five, six, and it keeps working,

38:22.600 --> 38:23.800
you know.

38:23.800 --> 38:28.270
I could throw out one, two,
three cards--still have one,

38:28.270 --> 38:30.670
two, three, four, five, six.

38:30.670 --> 38:32.100
It's counter intuitive.

38:32.100 --> 38:35.830
How can that be, to throw one,
two, three cards...

38:35.830 --> 38:39.930
still have one, two, three,
four, five, six, yeah.

38:39.930 --> 38:45.330
I can just throw out one, two,
three cards--still have one,

38:45.330 --> 38:48.030
two, three, four, five, six.

38:48.030 --> 38:50.100
I can do this forever, man.

38:50.100 --> 38:52.730
Throw out one, two, three cards.

38:52.730 --> 38:56.630
Still have one, two, three,
four, five, six!

38:56.630 --> 39:04.900
[applause]
Now to do this trick with cards,

39:04.900 --> 39:07.030
I need sleight of hand.

39:07.030 --> 39:10.970
But the cosmological constant
is really the way energy

39:10.970 --> 39:14.300
density through the universe
works and, more amazingly,

39:14.300 --> 39:15.600
fiction or magic trick.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.300
Teller reached in his pocket.

39:17.300 --> 39:19.370
He had pulled out a balloon
and he began blowing it up

39:19.370 --> 39:23.170
as he explained, "This brings us
to the forefront of science.

39:23.170 --> 39:25.030
The Higgs boson.

39:25.030 --> 39:28.300
Now, the theory was that
particles only have mass because

39:28.300 --> 39:31.830
of an unmeasured, theoretical
field that they move through.

39:31.830 --> 39:35.430
This may seem like an invisible
God, but the difference is,

39:35.430 --> 39:36.900
it could be tested.

39:36.900 --> 39:39.970
The Large Hadron Collider
tested it, and it sure

39:39.970 --> 39:43.070
looked like they predicted
Higgs lasted for a billionth

39:43.070 --> 39:47.730
of a billionth of a billionth
of a second before going poof

39:47.730 --> 39:52.000
and leaving behind the tell-tale
signature of our freely selected

39:52.000 --> 39:53.700
3 of Clubs.

39:53.700 --> 39:56.500
[cheers and applause]
Which lasted just as long as

40:00.530 --> 40:03.530
they measured before vanishing.

40:03.530 --> 40:05.430
Teller took a breath.

40:05.430 --> 40:13.000
He said, "Let my hands represent
quantum nothingness."

40:13.000 --> 40:19.370
Professor Lawrence Krauss looked
and he said, "Teller!

40:19.370 --> 40:21.930
[stops playing]
Please...

40:21.930 --> 40:26.530
Just sit down and shut up."

40:26.530 --> 40:29.570
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
