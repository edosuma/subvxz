WEBVTT

00:04.205 --> 00:06.307
What is that? Ahh!

00:06.407 --> 00:07.775
- They're deadly.
Don't let it bite you.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.610
But as long as you move--
- That is huge.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.046
- They have, like, nasty stings.
- That's the size of a bird.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.282
Oh my God, don't. Oh my God!

00:14.382 --> 00:16.050
What is that, for real?

00:16.150 --> 00:18.052
- No, they're harmless.
It's a fake beetle.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.721
We put kite string on them
and fly them.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.357
- Okay, or you could smash them.
That's an option.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.596
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:28.696 --> 00:30.964
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:31.065 --> 00:32.466
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:32.566 --> 00:34.468
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:34.568 --> 00:35.803
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.138
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:37.238 --> 00:38.839
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:38.939 --> 00:40.374
- You shut your face.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.543
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:42.643 --> 00:43.711
- We're back, baby!

00:46.847 --> 00:49.117
- Darrell, you look so
different.

00:49.217 --> 00:52.019
- I like it.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.788
I used to slick it back...
- You're looking cool.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.757
- So I didn't brush it
or do anything with it.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.360
Remember I spike it?

00:59.460 --> 01:00.728
- That's what it is.
- I like it.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.296
- Yours too.
Did you cut it, or what?

01:02.396 --> 01:03.864
- No, I need to get it cut.

01:03.964 --> 01:05.599
Your boyfriend?

01:05.699 --> 01:07.135
- No. He's competition.

01:07.235 --> 01:10.504
- Oh, competition. You got
chocolate on your--

01:10.604 --> 01:11.839
- I'm Darrell.
- Nice to meet you.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.141
- Justin.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.608
- Yeah, you always say your
name.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.144
You don't say "Nice to meet
you." Say, "I'm Justin."

01:16.244 --> 01:17.445
- You gotta earn my name though,
that's the thing.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.979
- I don't have to earn nothing,
man.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.615
This Justin guy needs to
check his watch.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.117
It's not amateur hour.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.685
- What do we got--

01:24.785 --> 01:27.288
Laurel, Hardy over here?
He make you wear that shirt?

01:27.388 --> 01:30.624
Pull your zipper up,
dumb .

01:30.724 --> 01:32.393
I'm Emily.

01:32.493 --> 01:33.794
- Hi, I'm Alex.
- Alex, nice to meet you.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.163
- He's my cousin from Austria.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.331
- From Austria. Nice.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.667
- Uh, yeah.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.302
- You staying with Rene and
their family?

01:41.402 --> 01:43.471
- How do you get along
with Aunt Casey?

01:43.571 --> 01:44.772
- I get good along with them.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.174
- Oh, I'll bet you do.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.946
- Hey, anyway. We'll just be
positive, and it's negative

01:53.046 --> 01:54.815
over here. We gotta go over
here. Come on.

01:54.915 --> 01:58.085
All right,
nice to meet you.

01:58.186 --> 02:00.654
- Good morning, everybody. My
name is Emily, I'm going to be

02:00.754 --> 02:03.491
your auctioneer, once we get in
there, I'm gonna open the door.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.426
You can't touch anything, you
can't go inside.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.127
And then I'm gonna sell it, and
we're gonna move on.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.129
If you guys are ready, then so
am I. Let's go!

02:09.230 --> 02:11.732
- Let's do it!
Where are we going?

02:13.467 --> 02:15.636
- The first three units are
all owned by the same person,

02:15.736 --> 02:18.105
and they've been here for over
10 years.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.940
- Wow.
- So keep that in mind.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.343
And here we go, first unit of
the day.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.811
- Oh yeah.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.746
- There's two more just like it
coming up.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.415
- Well do you guarantee they're
just like it, or--

02:27.515 --> 02:29.116
- No I don't guarantee anything,
Rene.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.684
- Well, you just said it.

02:30.784 --> 02:36.457
- A glass case. Mom's materials.
Big time sewer. Interesting.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.626
- There's some nice furniture,
bedroom set in here,

02:38.726 --> 02:40.494
kitchen set. I'm really
interested in this.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.263
I'll probably give a swing at
this one.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.031
- There's an interesting little
locker.

02:44.131 --> 02:45.799
Everything is wrapped good, it
smells old.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.202
You can tell it's been here
forever. I like this locker.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.538
It has potential.
Let's see what happens.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.906
- Okay. Vintage galore.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.243
Like those pieces right there
that are wrapped,

02:55.343 --> 02:57.478
those are
mid-century modern.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.414
I'm in. Now I just have to worry
about that guy over there.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.716
This is one of the best lockers
I've ever seen.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.786
I just know that greedy Rene is
gonna try to get it.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.154
- All righty, guys. Here we go.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.122
First unit of the day, and it's
a good one.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.659
And what do you say there?
500, can I get 600?

03:11.759 --> 03:15.496
600 now, , 700,
800? 800, 900.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.298
1,000. 1,100?

03:17.398 --> 03:18.799
- Yeah.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.468
- Yeah.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.902
- Hey don't you have to go save
that money to go eat?

03:22.002 --> 03:23.304
12, 13.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.138
- And 13, now 14, make it 15.
- Yeah.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.040
- 14 then make it 15, how about
16?

03:27.140 --> 03:29.643
- Yeah.
- 16, 17, and 18.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.312
- 17, 18.
- Yeah.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.247
- And 18, now 19.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.815
- You do the talking, I do the
buying

03:34.915 --> 03:39.052
- Oh, you got quiet.

03:39.152 --> 03:41.955
- Sold to you, Rene, your way.
$1,800 wins it.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.991
- One down, two to go.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.295
Let's not let him just steal it.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.662
God.
Should've cleared him out.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.298
- There was like 10 pieces of
art in there.

03:50.398 --> 03:53.301
I should've--I thought I had it
at 18. I'm not joking.

03:53.401 --> 03:56.036
- Next unit, same owner.

03:56.136 --> 03:59.307
Here we go, another
one been here 10 years.

03:59.407 --> 04:02.776
*

04:02.876 --> 04:04.445
- The furniture actually looks
pretty clean in here.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.046
It's connected to the other unit
that Rene has,

04:06.146 --> 04:07.481
so I'll probably take a
swing at it.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.484
- This display case is nice.
Lots of boxes back there

04:10.584 --> 04:13.821
that say, "Fragile," "Glass,"
so I'm in.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.222
- Clean, real clean.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.724
- Yeah, it's all wrapped up.
It's clean.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.826
- Wow, must be a good locker.
Sure quiet up front.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.895
- "Fragile," "glass," all these
boxes in the back are fragile.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.230
Fragile. Fragile.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.565
- I need to look.
- Come on up, Rene.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.634
- Those two showcases
are nice showcases.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.302
I actually need those
for the store.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.803
- All righty, guys. Second unit,

04:29.903 --> 04:31.472
and it's another really nice
one.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.442
And what do you say to 1,000?
Can I get 1,100?

04:34.542 --> 04:36.810
1,100 to 1,200. I got 1,200 and
1,300.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.747
I got 13, make it 1,400. Make it
1,500. 1,600.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.114
- And 1,500 to 1,600.
- Yeah.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.950
- 1,600, make it 1,700. 1,700,
are you sure?

04:43.050 --> 04:44.452
You want back in

04:44.552 --> 04:47.388
Sold it to you, 1,600.
Rene gets it again for 1,600.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.856
- Oh, I got it all right.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.159
Nah.

04:52.259 --> 04:54.328
I'm hungry
for the next locker.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.697
Let's go buy the next one.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.032
- This is the last unit that
goes with the two

04:59.132 --> 05:00.534
I've already told you about.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.869
This one's been here for 10
years, all right guys?

05:01.969 --> 05:03.236
Are we ready?

05:03.337 --> 05:04.605
*

05:04.705 --> 05:07.508
. .

05:10.578 --> 05:12.380
- That's a lot of stuff.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.583
- One thing I noticed,
Rene's boxes stopped at 50.

05:15.683 --> 05:19.687
These go to 152, so there's at
least 100 plus boxes.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.789
152, 154.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.425
- Furniture truly antique,
and then there's these boxes.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.294
Boxes, boxes galore.
What are you doing, Rene?

05:27.395 --> 05:28.362
- I'm seeing
if this is all closed.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.497
- No.
- Hey, no touching.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.664
- I'm not touching.
- Exactly.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.165
- I'm watching, I'm watching.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.667
- There's still a lot of cool
stuff in there.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.769
If it goes cheap, we'll pick
this one up too.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.371
This locker's the best
of them all.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.139
There is no way I'm not
getting it.

05:39.239 --> 05:40.874
- All righty, guys, here we go.
The last of the three

05:40.974 --> 05:42.209
of the ones that we sold today.

05:42.309 --> 05:43.911
What do you say to $1,000?

05:44.011 --> 05:46.213
- Yeah.
- 2,000.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.717
- 25.
- 25, 26.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.185
- 25, 26, 27.
- 3,000.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.788
32?
And 3,300.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.056
Can I make it 3,300? Now 3,400.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.257
- Good time, Mary,
to get one of them.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.563
- This is the best one out of
them all.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.566
- 3,500, 3,600. And 3,600 now,
can I make it 3,700?

06:05.666 --> 06:10.971
3,700

06:11.071 --> 06:13.173
Can I make it 3,800?
- I'm out of it.

06:13.273 --> 06:15.175
- He said, "I'm out of it."

06:15.275 --> 06:17.411
- Sold it to you, Rene gets it
again, the last one of the day

06:17.511 --> 06:20.481
there on the three that went
together for 3,700.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.083
- They could've got this
locker if they tried harder.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.818
And had more money.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.054
- Well the good news is,
he's probably done.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.156
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I mean...

06:29.256 --> 06:31.324
*

06:31.425 --> 06:34.728
A- All righty, guys. Here we go.
6, 5, 10, here we go.

06:34.828 --> 06:41.201
*

06:41.301 --> 06:44.505
- Some nice pots and pans,
household stuff. Couches okay.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.274
Truck tires. There's a nice
trunk down there.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.076
- Lookin' at this locker
tells me

06:49.176 --> 06:51.311
I should've bought one of
those earlier ones.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.815
- A few boxes. Sofa's not in too
bad of shape.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.518
Got the leather jacket there
that's in pretty nice condition.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.654
- There's some boxes, maybe some
trinkets in there.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.790
I'm in.
- All right, guys. Here we go.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.125
6x10. And what do you say
there to 100?

07:05.225 --> 07:06.760
And 100, gonna make it 100.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.328
One and a quarter,
hundred and a half,

07:08.428 --> 07:10.063
175, gonna make it 200. Gonna
make it 200 and a quarter.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.365
200 and a half, I got 250, can I
make it 275?

07:12.466 --> 07:13.501
300, 300 and a quarter. 300 and
a half.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.168
- Right here.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.436
- Yeah!

07:16.537 --> 07:18.238
Make it 450.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.573
- Right here.
- Yeah.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.278
- Hey I thought we were friends
here.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.114
That's your second "Yeah."

07:27.214 --> 07:30.183
- Guess not.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.386
. 900.

07:33.487 --> 07:36.524
950

07:36.624 --> 07:39.760
Sold it to you, Mary got it for
$900, and Mary wins it.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.629
- With friends like these,
I'm gonna have to start

07:41.729 --> 07:43.163
bringing more money with me.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.998
Perfect.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.969
Oops.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.804
- All right you guys,
last unit of the day.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.173
It's a 10x10, let's see
what we got.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.742
*

07:54.842 --> 07:56.143
Whoo!

07:56.243 --> 07:58.078
*

07:58.178 --> 07:59.547
- Actually, it looks like a good
little locker,

07:59.647 --> 08:01.448
looks like a household locker.
The couch is brown,

08:01.549 --> 08:03.584
which is a popular color
to sell. It's fast.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.753
I don't know, my truck is about
full, but if it goes cheap,

08:05.853 --> 08:08.155
I'll still buy it. I'll send a
second truck.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.458
- Not the kind of stuff I look
for, so I think I'm out.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.994
there's no vintage treasures
in there.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.564
- It scares me when people pack
in their Hefty bags

08:16.664 --> 08:19.299
and stuff like that--that means
they got out of there quick,

08:19.399 --> 08:20.934
they couldn't go get boxes.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.270
- Got some good stuff in the bin
down there.

08:23.370 --> 08:24.938
Nice sofa, nice little cabinet
over there.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.439
All right, let's see what this
goes for.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.041
After all that smack I talked,
I can't leave

08:28.141 --> 08:29.677
without buying something.

08:29.777 --> 08:32.079
- All righty, guys, last unit
of the day.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.414
Nice and clean, and what do
you say there at 100?

08:34.514 --> 08:35.983
Can I make it 100?
- Yep.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.586
- 125 and 150.
- Yep.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.820
- Got 150, 175.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.689
- Right here.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.824
- Any day.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.594
- Dump it on him.
Teach that rookie a lesson.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.428
- Sold it to ya,
$200 to Justin.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.598
- I dumped a locker on Mary,
and got this better one

08:50.698 --> 08:51.899
for pretty much nothing.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.101
What can I say?
Young bucks save bucks.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.536
- That's gonna do it today,
guys. See you next time.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.107
- Why would you let the rookie
buy that for $200?

09:00.207 --> 09:01.642
That's a $500-600 one.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.877
- When I become as cool as you,
I'll buy the crap.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.779
- I just buy the good stuff.
You guys know that.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.280
- Guy's got the biggest mouth.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.149
- Hey, you're getting weak
in your old age, Darrell.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.252
- All right.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.287
All these buyers think
I'm just some kid.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.656
But I'm wise beyond my years--

09:15.756 --> 09:17.224
at least
that's what my mom says.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.126
Ugh. It's heavy.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.630
Heavy means good.
Uh. Shoes. $10 bag.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.767
- This is probably $60
on this item right here.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.268
Here's another $40 box.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.570
Got another one in here.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.640
Got a $100 bill in here.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.875
More kitchen stuff. So it looks
like we actually have

09:34.975 --> 09:36.443
whole sets of, like, dishware
in here.

09:36.543 --> 09:37.745
Easily $150 worth.

09:37.845 --> 09:41.081
Nice little bed?
$50 on it, it's brand new.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.951
Christmas decorations. $30.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.954
Ah, stuffed animals.
$20 in this bag.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.856
This is a neat little crate.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.124
This crate alone will get me
$20.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.960
$30 just right there in those
three books.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.494
$20 price tag on this bed.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.563
- can get $30 for that.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.598
Decoration stuff $25 box.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.134
We have another box of more
Christmas decorations,

10:01.234 --> 10:02.502
$30.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.471
This couch is pretty clean.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.173
You know I already have someone
that will buy it off me,

10:06.273 --> 10:08.141
but now knowing that
it's actually a whole sectional,

10:08.241 --> 10:10.477
I can probably charge him $400
just for this.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.112
Yeah, I got a couch guy.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.647
You don't think
I got a couch guy?

10:13.747 --> 10:15.348
- That's $30 for those three
chairs.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.449
$10 there.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.118
This--easy $20 bill.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.187
Last thing. $80 for this table.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.824
And that is everything.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.963
- Okay. Justin thought he ran me
up on this one,

10:30.063 --> 10:31.699
but we'll see about that.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.466
I paid a little bit more
than I wanted.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.837
But I think it's gonna be
full of finds.

10:36.937 --> 10:40.407
Some old sweatpants, disgusting.
No thanks.

10:40.507 --> 10:44.111
But I did see this right off
the bat, and this is very cool.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.714
This little wood butterfly.
Looks like it was handmade.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.116
Perfect for MarysFinds.com.
$40.

10:51.018 --> 10:55.355
This box looks promising. Oh!
I think it's for a wedding.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.457
Their toast. $10.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.927
Always the buyer,
never the bride.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.628
Story of my life.

11:01.729 --> 11:04.097
Oh my gosh, look at this cane.

11:04.197 --> 11:07.000
This engraving on this
is crazy time.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.737
And it kind of fits me
perfectly.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.439
Traveler's stick. $60.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.508
Ooh, this is cool. Casio.
$15 for this thing.

11:15.608 --> 11:18.345
This looks like
it's real silver.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.547
Looks mostly like costume
jewelry.

11:20.647 --> 11:23.250
$50 for all of this.
A sewing machine.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.252
I'd probably just take
the sewing machine out,

11:25.352 --> 11:27.187
keep this cute little drawer
right here,

11:27.287 --> 11:28.255
and sell it as a desk.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.656
Probably $40 for it.

11:29.757 --> 11:32.492
This is a cute little basket.

11:32.592 --> 11:35.028
Let's see.
Ooh, now we're talking.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.734
*
What the heck? Let's see.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.302
Oh, cool.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.772
It has all these bugs in it.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.640
It says "Assassin Bug," beetle,
moth.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.510
So neat.
It's like "Jurassic Park."

11:50.610 --> 11:53.146
He was trapped in the sap.

11:53.246 --> 11:56.083
I mean, who knows how long
these bugs have been in here?

11:56.183 --> 11:58.318
I definitely need to
get these checked out.

11:58.418 --> 12:02.756
Maybe I can make a dinosaur,
or a million bucks, or both.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.424
Cool little vintage suitcase.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.226
Looks like it's really worn,
though.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.361
$5 for this thing.

12:08.461 --> 12:11.164
There could be something
in here.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.733
It's all brass. Probably $20.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.870
I get to what
I've been wanting to open.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.072
*

12:19.172 --> 12:22.542
Now let's see what's inside.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.544
Oh my gosh. Sword!

12:24.644 --> 12:27.981
This is freakin' legit.
There's dragons on the handle.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.484
I'm the Khaleesi now.
Where are my dragons?

12:31.584 --> 12:34.922
Come, come. This scares me.

12:35.022 --> 12:38.859
$50. $50 for the trunk.

12:38.959 --> 12:42.629
Ooh, lots of trinkets.
These little wooden boxes.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.898
I'm gonna say $50 for all these.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.766
DVD's, $50.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.836
More knives, wow.

12:48.936 --> 12:52.772
Oh my gosh, double. Samurai.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.208
I'm gonna say, price: $75
for this thing.

12:55.308 --> 12:59.012
Wow, it's a mug. $100 box.

12:59.112 --> 13:03.216
Wine glass.
Ooh, some dragons. $50.

13:03.316 --> 13:06.519
I was hoping that this couch
would put me into some profit,

13:06.619 --> 13:08.521
but no, looks like it's trash.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.391
Ugh. It's terrible.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.294
Oh, what's up?
Making money left and right.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.795
What about you

13:15.896 --> 13:17.297
- I actually did
pretty--pretty good.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.465
- Yeah.

13:18.565 --> 13:19.967
Quadrupled my money, easily.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.334
- Okay, wow.
- Plus some.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.702
- I didn't come down here
to gloat or anything.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.137
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.605
- All right, well have fun with
your trash bags

13:25.705 --> 13:27.908
and your old DVD's, so--
- Cheep cheep, bro.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.077
- All right.
- Have a great day.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.644
If he ever bids me up
like that again,

13:31.744 --> 13:34.747
I'm gonna quadruple him
right in the face.

13:34.848 --> 13:38.051
Ugh. Trash, trash,
and more trash.

13:38.151 --> 13:43.256
So hoping that my vintage bugs
will pull me through.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.458
*

13:45.558 --> 13:47.427
- Well I can't wait to
see this one.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.029
- It's awesome.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.764
- Three lockers, I paid $7,100.
It's killer merchandise.

13:51.865 --> 13:54.167
I got a whole army
of my relatives here.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.369
Including my dad, Gunter.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.205
- Three lockers.
How big were they?

13:58.305 --> 13:59.572
- Three 10x15's.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.374
- What could you see
when you looked in there?

14:01.474 --> 14:02.642
- Just a lot of boxes.
Lot of clean boxes.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.146
An inquisition?

14:06.246 --> 14:07.847
Tatiana, please take Gunter,
take him up front,

14:07.948 --> 14:09.149
and have him run the store.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.350
I'm gonna go help them open up
the gate.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.718
- Gunter!

14:11.818 --> 14:13.353
- Don't mess it up.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.821
*

14:14.922 --> 14:16.656
- Wow, you weren't kidding.
Sure is packed.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.658
- I wasn't kidding.
Hey, take that inside.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.293
A piñata?

14:20.393 --> 14:22.262
- So all the furniture,
I want lined up just in rows.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.665
You can go start
all the way down there.

14:25.765 --> 14:27.400
These boxes are going to be
a big factor

14:27.500 --> 14:28.801
if this is a good
locker or not.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.471
Just start stacking it down
there.

14:31.571 --> 14:35.842
Oh! Murano!
That's a city in Italy, Murano.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.477
And it's world famous for
the glassware.

14:37.577 --> 14:38.946
I mean, they make the best.

14:39.046 --> 14:42.615
Oh, wow. This is all beautiful
art glass. Gunter!

14:42.715 --> 14:44.985
- Hi, welcome to Bargain
Hunters.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.387
I know how to run the cash
register now.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.122
- Rene, look at this.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.390
- Wow, I'm telling you.
We scored.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.325
This is all mid-century art
glass.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.694
- You know I'm selling like
crazy out there!

14:54.794 --> 14:57.697
- Yeah, I just made $14.

14:57.797 --> 15:00.067
- That's not selling like crazy.
- That is not that crazy.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.768
- Take all this paper,

15:01.868 --> 15:03.736
put it back in the boxes, and
take them outside to the trash.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.072
- I want to take the good stuff.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.739
- Gunter, let's get busy.
- Look at this!

15:06.839 --> 15:08.908
Are you serious?

15:09.009 --> 15:10.510
*

15:10.610 --> 15:13.746
- Aw, my back hurts.
- Nice try.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.383
- I'm in the Union, you know.
I'm not supposed to bend over

15:16.483 --> 15:17.517
for anybody.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.487
- Wow, look at this.
Every box--

15:20.587 --> 15:21.989
I have 300 boxes like this.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.356
- Yeah, I've got to go.
I've got customers waiting,

15:23.456 --> 15:24.357
and they like me, they want to
buy something,

15:24.457 --> 15:25.825
and that benefits you.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.894
- I need you to clean.
- Ja, I know what you need.

15:27.995 --> 15:31.364
- Wow. Italia Opalino.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.700
I mean, this is all Italian,
which is awesome.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.735
Oh, wow. The same designer,
everything.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.604
Murano "Rosaline" Pink.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.974
The asking price is $250.
- Wow.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.410
- I don't know, this
is frickin' awesome. Yes!

15:43.510 --> 15:46.779
Whoo! I just hit
a home run again.

15:46.879 --> 15:49.782
- And he scores.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.051
- Ooh.
- Oh, wow.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.652
- That's beautiful.
- Oh, yeah.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.856
How much of the truck
have we done?

15:56.956 --> 16:00.660
- 5%. Look, right here,
there's at least 100 pieces

16:00.760 --> 16:02.429
of Murano glass.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.497
You know some pieces
will be $75,

16:04.597 --> 16:06.166
some pieces will be 400-500
bucks.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.634
- Wow.
- So let's be conservative.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.070
Let's say 150 bucks a piece.
That's $15,000.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.204
- Oh my God.
- That's more than double

16:11.304 --> 16:12.505
I paid for the whole truck.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.974
- Unbelievable.
So this one is $15,000,

16:15.075 --> 16:16.409
how much is
the other shelf?

16:16.509 --> 16:17.544
- These big vases,
you're looking

16:17.644 --> 16:19.046
at 3, 4, 500 bucks with Murano.

16:19.146 --> 16:22.115
Conservatively, there's at least
another $10,000 there.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.451
So between the two shelves,
that's $25,000.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.785
That's four times my investment.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.854
- There better not be an
earthquake right now.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.326
- This is it.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.262
- What the...

16:35.362 --> 16:37.664
mummy.
Is that real?

16:37.764 --> 16:39.466
I need to conjure up a profit.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.168
So I'm taking my Jurassic bugs

16:41.268 --> 16:43.370
to Nancy Smith, at Necromance.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.072
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- You too.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.373
You called earlier.
- Yeah.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.607
- Cool, good to see you.

16:47.707 --> 16:48.841
- I think I found
the right spot.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.477
- I'm excited to see this.
- Yeah.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.212
- Okay, so I found these
in a storage unit.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.714
- Mm-hmm. These are fossils.
They were--probably climbed

16:54.814 --> 16:57.950
in a pine tree, and the pine sap
started coming out--

16:58.051 --> 17:00.353
And the bug got caught
in the sap.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.889
That's pretty cool.
That might be an assassin bug.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.957
- That's kind of weird.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.559
- Yeah, they suck blood.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.129
- You know, so they have
this long proboscis,

17:09.229 --> 17:11.731
that'll go in your skin
and suck blood.

17:11.831 --> 17:12.999
- Wow.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.568
Nature is freakin' bananas.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.470
How long does it take,
you think, to form one of these?

17:17.570 --> 17:19.372
- Well they could be 400 million
years old,

17:19.472 --> 17:20.740
but I don't think these are.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.743
These are probably like 20
million years old.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.713
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.581
- That's gotta mean money,
right?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.850
What are we talking here? How
much would you give me for them?

17:30.950 --> 17:34.687
- Little ones...

17:34.787 --> 17:37.524
These are the two I really like.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.726
What about...

17:39.826 --> 17:41.894
Mm...

17:41.994 --> 17:44.764
600 bucks?
- Okay, that's a deal.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.933
This is the only time
you'll hear me say this,

17:47.033 --> 17:48.768
thank God for bugs!

17:48.868 --> 17:49.969
Now you gotta show me around
this place.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.604
- Absolutely.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.440
- Well, what are you more
interested in?

17:53.540 --> 17:55.007
- Everything!

17:56.576 --> 17:59.078
- Looks like you guys
might have been busy.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.614
I already made $25,000
on art glass,

18:01.714 --> 18:03.383
and we're just getting
started.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.684
Let's price some of the
furniture.

18:04.784 --> 18:05.785
We got a lot of mid-century
stuff here.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.420
This is 400 for that row.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.222
I'll say $700 for this row.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.023
There's another $600
in this row.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.793
Let's say another 700 bucks
for this row right here.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.728
200 bucks for this row.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.831
So these two rows right here,
at least $1,000.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.269
And all this furniture right
here, at least another $4,500.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.103
I know we have this wooden grate
somewhere, right?

18:24.204 --> 18:25.638
I've been dying to see this.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.941
It says fragile, it says glass,
it says made in Italy.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.443
It says everything in it
is Murano,

18:30.543 --> 18:31.844
I feel like Indiana Jones
right now.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.846
- Just don't be
whacking it with the crowbar.

18:33.946 --> 18:34.847
- I won't whack it. I got it.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.350
- Back up. He's clumsy.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.421
Ahh!

18:41.521 --> 18:43.290
There's actually a big-ass
roach in there.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.591
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.293
- I see--
- Oh my God, oh my God.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.994
He's really big.
- Relax.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.696
*

18:49.796 --> 18:51.864
- Oh, my God.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.001
- Careful. Don't--okay. Okay.
- Don't touch me!

18:55.101 --> 18:56.436
- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.104
Okay, put it down.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.840
*

19:00.940 --> 19:02.842
- That's at least 200 pounds.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.677
- Wow. You're strong.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.779
Oh, please don't hurt yourself.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.850
I gotta look up online.
I mean, this--

19:10.950 --> 19:12.118
I don't know how to price them.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.321
Let me just type in
large crystal.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.591
That can't be right.

19:18.691 --> 19:22.229
- This is 26 inches. It has
the point, which is important.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.964
There's one at 16 inches, which
is half of this size, 60 pounds.

19:25.064 --> 19:28.401
This is twice the size,
200 pounds, $15,000.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.904
That's that for half. This one
here, a third of the size

19:32.004 --> 19:35.275
with less stones, and only like
20 pounds, $6,000.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.777
So I'm going to say
conservatively, for the two...

19:37.877 --> 19:40.179
$25,000.
- If not more.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.981
- And I couldn't even find any
that big.

19:42.081 --> 19:44.183
- This is amazing.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.686
- There's another 280 boxes
in this truck.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.555
- Easily.
- Plus 20-30 right here.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.790
Let's be conservative--
let's say 75 bucks a box,

19:50.890 --> 19:52.559
the way this is going, it's
probably going to be a lot more,

19:52.659 --> 19:56.596
but let's just say 75 bucks
a box, that's another 22,500.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.831
- Unbelievable.
- I am good.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.467
- Rene, it's past 3:00.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.001
I've got to be home,
take a shower.

20:02.101 --> 20:03.636
I have a dinner date tonight.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.238
- I got bad news--you're
working 'til 9:00 tonight.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.007
- Guess how much we made on this
locker?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.511
- 80,500.
- Oh my God.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.846
- Yeah, you might actually get
paid today.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.316
- No, I'm just kidding.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.585
announcer: Rene Nezhoda was
unbreakable,

20:18.685 --> 20:22.722
banking over 73 grand
with no help from Gunter.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.224
Justin Bryant didn't kid
around

20:25.325 --> 20:27.126
making $950.

20:27.226 --> 20:31.931
Mary Padian's Jurassic bugs
netted her $366.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.368
And Darrell Sheets
left with nothing but regret.

20:35.468 --> 20:38.170
Welcome to Bargain Hunters.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.707
Oh, you got a little baby,
right?

20:40.807 --> 20:43.075
No

20:43.175 --> 20:45.144
Yeah, I got an old bag
at home too.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.650
Oh yeah, there's tax.
Are you kidding me?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.151
Welcome to America.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.954
Let me know if you need help
in the dressing room.

20:55.054 --> 20:58.491
Oh, you buy it, you broke it.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.460
No, don't worry about it.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.529
