00:02.850 --> 00:07.137
She comes like fullest moon
on happy night...

00:07.139 --> 00:09.990
Taper of waist with
shape of magic might,

00:09.992 --> 00:12.009
she hath an eye whose
glances quell mankind...

00:12.011 --> 00:13.110
Make him shut up.

00:13.112 --> 00:15.862
Nobody wants to hear
what he's got to say.

00:15.864 --> 00:19.300
And Ruby on her cheeks
reflects this light...

00:22.221 --> 00:25.172
This is Warden Hansen.

00:25.174 --> 00:27.591
I understand.

00:27.593 --> 00:30.261
We'll proceed.

00:30.263 --> 00:34.648
Envails her hips
the blackness of her hair.

00:34.650 --> 00:38.736
Beware of curls that
bite with viper bite...

00:38.738 --> 00:42.239
Her sides are silken soft...

00:44.694 --> 00:48.929
While the heart mere rock behind
that surface escapes our sight...

00:48.931 --> 00:51.081
The Channel 13
news team is standing by

00:51.083 --> 00:53.117
outside the walls
of Gunter state prison

00:53.119 --> 00:54.919
to bring you live coverage.

00:54.921 --> 00:57.755
We've received word that the
final appeal has been denied

00:57.757 --> 00:59.623
and the scheduled execution
of Rodney Garrett

00:59.625 --> 01:02.176
by firing squad
is now imminent.

01:02.178 --> 01:06.380
Never while I live shall I cease
to blame myself for the past...

01:10.352 --> 01:14.188
From the fringed
curtains of her eye...

01:19.261 --> 01:22.980
She shoots shafts
that at furthest range--

01:37.212 --> 01:39.964
We've just received confirmation
from prison officials

01:39.966 --> 01:42.216
that at 6:43 a.m.
local time

01:42.218 --> 01:43.751
Rodney Baines Garrett

01:43.753 --> 01:46.503
was put to death
by firing squad,

01:46.505 --> 01:49.256
bringing to an end
the long...

01:50.225 --> 01:54.294
A row house
in Dupont Circle. Wow.

01:54.296 --> 01:55.596
I can't believe
I'm doing it.

01:55.598 --> 01:57.631
I mean, it's probably not gonna
work out anyway, right?

01:57.633 --> 01:59.800
There are 5 other
sealed bids,

01:59.802 --> 02:02.903
and I offered way below
what the owners are asking.

02:02.905 --> 02:05.639
Uh-huh. Sounds to me like
someone's hoping they don't get it.

02:05.641 --> 02:07.891
Orthophobia--
fear of owning personal property.

02:07.893 --> 02:10.026
No, I don't have a fear
of owning stuff.

02:10.029 --> 02:12.079
Turn me loose in a shoe store,
I'll prove that.

02:12.081 --> 02:15.816
My fear is personal property
that weighs 300 tons.

02:15.818 --> 02:18.485
Actually, depending on
materials used, square footage,

02:18.487 --> 02:20.304
and horizontal versus vertical
construction,

02:20.306 --> 02:22.923
the average house
only weighs about 60 tons.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.157
Well, thanks for that, Reid.

02:24.159 --> 02:25.676
I feel light as a bird
already.

02:25.678 --> 02:27.261
What have we got,
baby girl?

02:27.263 --> 02:29.263
Thank you, sir.
We have a killing

02:29.265 --> 02:30.831
in Enid, Oklahoma.

02:30.833 --> 02:34.601
And not the capital punishment
one you are thinking of right now.

02:34.603 --> 02:36.670
I'm talking about a woman
named Cara Smith,

02:36.672 --> 02:38.105
who was murdered
in her apartment

02:38.107 --> 02:40.107
minutes after the execution
of Rodney Garrett.

02:40.109 --> 02:42.393
Neighbors saw her front door
open and discovered the body.

02:42.395 --> 02:43.727
Look familiar?

02:43.729 --> 02:45.396
Young, pretty,
short blond hair.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.481
And stabbed directly
through the heart.

02:47.483 --> 02:49.366
That's exactly the way
Garrett killed his victims.

02:49.368 --> 02:50.701
So are we looking
at a copycat?

02:50.703 --> 02:53.070
Or someone creating doubt
the right person was executed.

02:53.072 --> 02:54.571
In Garrett's case
there was no doubt.

02:54.573 --> 02:57.408
His guilt was the slam dunk
of all slam dunks.

02:57.410 --> 03:00.026
Prints, DNA, a confession.

03:00.028 --> 03:02.195
He even led the police to where
he buried two of his victims.

03:02.197 --> 03:04.030
Garrett killed 25 women
before he was caught.

03:04.032 --> 03:05.883
If this new unsub
is a copycat,

03:05.885 --> 03:07.551
the body count's
just started.

03:07.553 --> 03:09.253
Which is why
we can't waste time.

03:09.255 --> 03:10.721
Wheels up in 30.

03:21.399 --> 03:25.436
I know, I know.
You're hungry.

03:25.438 --> 03:28.021

That's not something

05:05.119 --> 05:07.174
Well, Garrett had the option
of lethal injection,

05:07.199 --> 05:08.154
but he chose this instead.

05:08.155 --> 05:09.504
A flair for the dramatic.

05:09.506 --> 05:11.940
These reports indicate
no forensic evidence

05:12.676 --> 05:14.259

- It was generic.

No serial number

05:15.796 --> 05:18.547
Well, now, it says here
that there were water droplets

and a half-filled flower vase
on top of the chest of drawers,

05:21.668 --> 05:23.334
but no flowers.
Not in the vase,

05:23.336 --> 05:24.853
not in the garbage,
nowhere.

05:24.855 --> 05:27.172
Maybe the unsub
took them.

Hey, say it

you will see Cara Smith.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.364
College student, well-liked,
straight as, English Lit major.

05:36.366 --> 05:39.017
Oh, speaking of which,
I just got a transcript

05:39.019 --> 05:40.535
of Rodney Garrett's
last words,

05:40.537 --> 05:43.021
hot off the press, and a gold
star to the first person

05:43.023 --> 05:45.040
who can identify
the source of this.

"with shape of magic might."

05:50.530 --> 05:51.630
It's from the "Thousand
and One Nights.'

05:51.632 --> 05:53.465
not the exact translation
that I would have used,

05:53.467 --> 05:54.699
but it's got its own merits.

05:54.701 --> 05:57.035
And in a shocking non-upset,
we have a winner.

05:57.117 --> 05:58.633
Garrett was
a sixth-grade dropout.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.734
An unlikely guy
to be quoting

06:00.736 --> 06:02.102
from a Harvard classic.

06:02.104 --> 06:03.403
The choice of material
does make sense, though.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.988
The book is all about
how Scheherazade

06:04.990 --> 06:06.823
forestalled her own death
at the hands of the king

06:06.825 --> 06:08.825
by regaling him night
after night with stories.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.577
But in the end,
she won him over, right?

06:10.579 --> 06:12.829
The kind found love and
he decided not to execute her.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.331
Not a strategy
likely to work

06:14.333 --> 06:15.281
with the Oklahoma

06:15.283 --> 06:17.200
Department
of Corrections.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.232
Another body's been found
half a mile from

06:19.257 --> 06:20.504
the first victim. Same M.O.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.673
That's 6 hours later. This guy's
not wasting a lot of time.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.241
We land in 20 minutes.
Reid, you an JJ

06:25.243 --> 06:27.293
go to the latest crime scene.
Rossi, you and Prentiss

06:27.295 --> 06:29.846
talk to Garrett's widow.
Morgan and I will go to the prison.

06:29.848 --> 06:33.049
If Garrett's got a disciple, we need
to find out who he is and fast.

06:33.051 --> 06:34.184
Open gate.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.685
The last thing
this town needs

06:35.687 --> 06:39.356
is a Rod Garrett
wannabe on the loose.

06:40.924 --> 06:42.942
Did Garrett have
any followers in prison?

06:42.944 --> 06:45.228
No. He was a loner.
For the last 7 years

06:45.230 --> 06:47.313
a box was Rod Garrett's
whole world.

06:47.315 --> 06:48.314
What about visitors?

06:48.316 --> 06:50.099
Only his wife.

06:50.101 --> 06:51.701
According to Garrett's
prison history,

06:51.703 --> 06:53.319
he was attacked twice
while incarcerated?

06:53.321 --> 06:56.156
Shanked. Both times
Garrett got the upper hand

06:56.158 --> 06:58.291
and killed the assailant
with their own knife.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.003
Our internal investigation
determined them

07:00.028 --> 07:01.612
to be unprovoked attacks.

07:01.613 --> 07:03.780
Both hits might have
originated on the outside.

07:03.782 --> 07:05.298
Well, it makes sense.
25 women brutally killed,

07:05.300 --> 07:07.884
I can imagine there's a long list
of friends and family

07:07.886 --> 07:09.052
who'd want Garrett dead.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.589
Well, whoever it was,
it didn't work.

07:12.591 --> 07:14.474
This is it.

07:17.428 --> 07:19.512
I don't mean to sound
overly dramatic,

07:19.514 --> 07:23.983
but there was something
unkillable about Garrett.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.686
I had my doubts
that damn firing squad

07:26.688 --> 07:29.022
was gonna get the job done.

07:30.991 --> 07:34.160
No, I couldn't bring myself
to go to the execution.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.163
Me and Rod said our goodbyes
the night before.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.199
You supported him
until the end,

07:39.201 --> 07:42.535
even knowing
what he'd done. Why?

07:44.338 --> 07:48.875
10 years ago, when Rod and I
first started dating, I got sick.

07:48.877 --> 07:51.211
Chemo. Surgeries.

07:51.213 --> 07:53.329
It would have been easy
for Rod to move on,

07:53.331 --> 07:57.350
find somebody else.
But he didn't.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.385
He stood by my side.

07:59.387 --> 08:02.722
When I was better,
we got married.

08:02.724 --> 08:05.442
Now, Rod had to have been
sick, mentally,

08:05.444 --> 08:07.694
to do the things that he did
to all those women.

08:07.696 --> 08:10.590
Now, I know that.

08:10.592 --> 08:13.309
How could I abandon him
after all he done for me?

08:13.311 --> 08:17.013
He started killing shortly after
you were married?

08:17.015 --> 08:18.398
Yeah.

08:18.400 --> 08:22.318
And you never suspected
this other life he was leading?

08:22.320 --> 08:23.987
No.

08:23.989 --> 08:27.690
People only see what
they want to see, I guess.

08:28.993 --> 08:32.145
Where will you go now,
Helen?

08:32.147 --> 08:36.982
I put in for a transfer
for a job in Missouri.

08:36.985 --> 08:38.524
Don't know anybody there.

08:38.549 --> 08:40.542
People don't know me.
It's a fresh start.

08:40.989 --> 08:43.155
What about family?

08:43.158 --> 08:45.992
My family don't
want to know me.

08:45.994 --> 08:48.294
They couldn't understand
why I'd stand by Rod

08:48.296 --> 08:50.130
after everything
that he done.

08:50.132 --> 08:53.633
As far as they're concerned,
I'm as just bad as him.

08:53.635 --> 08:56.019
I'm sorry.

08:58.139 --> 09:01.608
I do blame myself
sometimes.

09:01.610 --> 09:03.676
A man's got needs.

09:03.678 --> 09:05.445
You know.

09:05.447 --> 09:09.365
Maybe things just got all
twisted up in Rod's brain.

09:09.367 --> 09:12.986
Because when I got sick, I couldn't
give him what he wanted.

09:12.988 --> 09:16.456
Helen, you didn't kill
those women.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.412
Well...

09:24.465 --> 09:26.633
I forgot I even had this.

09:26.635 --> 09:29.169
What is it?

09:29.171 --> 09:31.504
Divining rod.

09:31.506 --> 09:35.425
It belonged to my great Uncle
up in Bartlesville.

09:35.427 --> 09:37.977
He could find
well water with it.

09:37.979 --> 09:41.648
And people say that's hocus pocus,
but it isn't.

09:42.766 --> 09:45.551
My daddy said that I had
one of these in me.

09:45.553 --> 09:48.438
That I could find
the bad in any man.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.941
See beneath the surface
and find the evil.

09:51.943 --> 09:55.778
Maybe daddy was right
the way Rod turned out.

10:02.336 --> 10:05.255
Oh. Hey.
I'm Detective Childers.

10:05.257 --> 10:07.457
You must be with the FBI?

10:07.459 --> 10:08.791

This is Dr. Reid.

10:08.793 --> 10:10.510
Hi.

10:12.129 --> 10:15.682
Why don't y'all
follow me back here.

10:15.684 --> 10:18.718
It's unbelievable this is
happening all over again.

10:18.720 --> 10:19.919
Who is she?

10:19.921 --> 10:22.805
Jodie Armstrong. Single,
works at a cosmetic counter

10:22.807 --> 10:24.607
at a department store
downtown.

10:24.609 --> 10:26.192
Young, pretty,
short blond hair.

10:26.194 --> 10:27.477
Same victimology as the others.

10:27.479 --> 10:28.561
Who discovered
the body?

10:28.563 --> 10:30.396
Apartment manager.

10:30.398 --> 10:31.882
A neighbor called to complain
that a teapot

10:31.907 --> 10:33.887
in the kitchen
kept on whistling.

10:35.786 --> 10:37.320
At the main gate.

10:37.322 --> 10:38.988
Anything else you need,
let me know.

10:38.990 --> 10:40.373
Thank you. We will.

10:40.375 --> 10:43.210
Non-prison personnel
park outside the gate

10:43.235 --> 10:45.045
and get shuttled in.

10:45.046 --> 10:47.297
How often
did Garrett's wife visit?

10:47.299 --> 10:49.549
Never missed a day.
Not a one.

10:49.551 --> 10:52.635
There'd be times she'd come,
we be in emergency lockdown

10:52.637 --> 10:54.387
and everyone else
would go back home.

10:54.389 --> 10:56.256
Not her.
She'd wait.

10:56.258 --> 10:57.840
Hour after hour,
rain or shine,

10:57.842 --> 10:59.959
just in case
lockdown got lifted.

10:59.961 --> 11:01.094
Devoted.

11:01.096 --> 11:04.480
Yeah. To a man who slaughtered
two dozen women.

11:04.482 --> 11:06.316
Go figure.

11:09.153 --> 11:10.820
You have our number.

11:10.822 --> 11:15.158
If you remember anything
that can help us, please call.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.359
Yeah.

11:16.361 --> 11:19.645
It looks like your husband
has an admirer, Helen.

11:19.647 --> 11:21.647
So please think about
any phone calls

11:21.649 --> 11:24.567
you or he might have gotten
or any suspicious fan mail.

11:24.569 --> 11:25.818
I will.

11:25.820 --> 11:28.171
Most of the mail
that he got was hateful.

11:28.173 --> 11:29.756
So I screened out
the mean, crazy ones

11:29.758 --> 11:31.090
and I only kept
the positive ones

11:31.092 --> 11:32.592
to take to the prison
to read to him.

11:32.594 --> 11:35.928
People wrote him here,
not the prison?

11:35.930 --> 11:37.997
Rod said that the guards
were opening his mail

11:37.999 --> 11:39.665
and taking the money
that people sent.

11:39.667 --> 11:43.386
He had a defense fund.
So I got a post office box.

11:43.388 --> 11:45.805
Do you still have
any of those letters?

11:45.807 --> 11:48.174
Mm-hmm. Kept 'em all.

11:48.176 --> 11:50.393
Would you mind
if we took a look at them?

11:57.868 --> 12:00.186
You can have them.
Now that Rod's gone

12:00.188 --> 12:02.538
I was just gonna
throw them out anyway.

12:04.158 --> 12:06.309
Thank you.

12:18.255 --> 12:19.889
Hey, Spence.

12:19.891 --> 12:21.391
Look at this.

12:21.393 --> 12:22.708
What is it?

12:22.710 --> 12:27.563
This girl obviously
cares about her appearance.

12:27.565 --> 12:29.982
I mean, she's fit, her nails
are perfectly done,

12:29.984 --> 12:33.886
but look at her hair.
It's uneven.

12:33.888 --> 12:35.772
Could it maybe be
a fashion statement,

12:35.774 --> 12:37.390
you know, bad on purpose?

12:37.392 --> 12:40.159
Hey, look at this.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.916
That was taken last night.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.952
The unsub cut her hair.

13:00.013 --> 13:03.633
I just got home from work.
We still on for tonight?

13:05.636 --> 13:09.355
I am pouring wine. Good ears.

13:12.609 --> 13:16.279
It has been
that kind of week.

13:16.281 --> 13:18.931
I should bring a jacket, right?

13:18.933 --> 13:22.618
The restaurant always has
the A/C cranked up way too high.

13:31.212 --> 13:34.747
Yeah? Uh-huh.

13:37.634 --> 13:39.168
Hold on.

13:45.342 --> 13:48.728
So I'll see you there
in like an hour?

13:50.564 --> 13:51.898
I can't wait.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.180
This new guy's hunting
in a different neighborhood.

14:41.182 --> 14:43.566
He must be comfortable
in the area.

14:43.568 --> 14:44.951
The knew the victims'
routines.

14:44.953 --> 14:47.686
His method of ingress and
egress is quiet and unnoticeable.

14:47.688 --> 14:49.238
Get a load of this one.

14:49.240 --> 14:50.319
"Dear Mr. Garrett:

14:50.344 --> 14:52.808
It took a lot of courage
to do what you did.

14:52.877 --> 14:57.046
"Most people are cowards and don't
do what they feel inside them.

14:57.048 --> 15:00.716
You are an inspiration
and I applaud you."

15:00.718 --> 15:03.219
"I applaud you."

15:03.221 --> 15:05.388
These are supposed to be
the non-wacko letters.

15:05.390 --> 15:06.639
Hey, guess what.

15:06.641 --> 15:08.224
JJ's genius
has struck again.

15:08.226 --> 15:10.259
That hunch about
the hair was right.

15:10.261 --> 15:12.562
I'm sending you
an ATM image of Cara Smith.

15:12.564 --> 15:14.012
She's the first victim.
This was taken

15:14.037 --> 15:16.214
10 hours before
her murder. Check it.

15:16.901 --> 15:18.901
The unsub
cut her hair, too.

15:18.903 --> 15:21.053
You know, there could be
a sexual element involved.

15:21.055 --> 15:22.157
Trichophilia is a fetish

15:22.182 --> 15:24.182
where one becomes aroused
by the removal of hair.

15:24.275 --> 15:27.193
Well, either way, it's starting
to look less like a copycat.

15:27.195 --> 15:29.495
The unsub's deviating
too much from Garrett's M.O.

15:29.497 --> 15:31.030
Garrett never took trophies.

15:31.032 --> 15:32.582
He's also choosing
low-risk victims.

15:32.584 --> 15:34.917
Garrett stayed with high-risk targets--
prostitutes, runaways.

15:34.919 --> 15:36.714
Garrett also got sloppy
and left behind clues

15:36.739 --> 15:38.288
that eventually nailed him.

15:38.289 --> 15:40.206
This guy's careful
and meticulous.

15:40.208 --> 15:41.924
He's not that careful.

15:41.926 --> 15:44.210
He leaves doors open,
teapots boiling.

15:44.212 --> 15:45.962
I think it's intentional.

15:45.964 --> 15:48.631
He wants the bodies found so we
know when and where he's killing.

16:29.619 --> 16:31.069
He started to shave her head.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.201
Even more humiliation
and disrespect.

16:34.203 --> 16:37.104
He didn't do it
to the other victims.

16:37.106 --> 16:38.706
Detective, when was
the body discovered?

16:38.708 --> 16:39.940
Half hour ago.

16:39.942 --> 16:42.877
The killer left the front
and back doors open.

16:42.879 --> 16:44.941
There's no indication
of any contact on the wine

16:44.966 --> 16:46.906
glasses swabbed for DNA.

16:46.968 --> 16:48.134
Not even the victim's?

16:48.885 --> 16:51.302
The unsub probably
wiped it down.

16:51.304 --> 16:53.620
Has anyone found an open or
empty wine bottle in the house?

16:53.622 --> 16:55.473
We haven't found one yet.

16:55.475 --> 16:58.008
He probably took it with him
like the flowers from the first victim.

16:58.010 --> 17:00.094
He's killed at 6 a.m., noon,
and 6 p.m.

17:00.096 --> 17:01.962
I don't know about you guys,
but I'm not feeling so good

17:01.964 --> 17:03.647
about the stroke
of midnight.

17:04.965 --> 17:08.486
Do you remember when people
used to write letters by hand?

17:08.488 --> 17:10.604
That's how I wrote
my first book.

17:10.606 --> 17:12.990
Give me a keyboard any day.

17:12.992 --> 17:14.474
Oh, come on, Rossi.

17:14.477 --> 17:16.739
The excitement of seeing
an envelope

17:16.763 --> 17:18.742
from a friend
in your mailbox.

17:19.082 --> 17:23.150
Now it's just an electronic ding
on your computer.

17:23.152 --> 17:26.787
One of my various
brothers-in-law was a mailman.

17:26.789 --> 17:30.091
He said the expression
"going postal"

17:30.093 --> 17:32.476
made perfect sense to him.

17:32.478 --> 17:36.297
He spent all day delivering
a mountain of letters

17:36.299 --> 17:38.299
one at a time.

17:38.301 --> 17:40.885
Then he'd go to work
the next morning

17:40.887 --> 17:43.837
and there's a whole
new mountain to deal with.

17:43.839 --> 17:46.474
And it's forever.

17:46.476 --> 17:48.275
It sounds like our job.

17:48.277 --> 17:51.729
It took 7 years for the world to
get rid of Rod Garrett

17:51.731 --> 17:55.483
and 15 minutes after, a new one
pops up to take his place.

17:55.485 --> 17:56.817
Whoa.

17:56.819 --> 17:58.369
What is it?

17:58.371 --> 18:01.455
"She comes like fullest moon
on happy night,

18:01.457 --> 18:04.375
taper of waist
with shape of magic might."

18:04.377 --> 18:07.745
The exact words Garrett said
before he was executed.

18:07.747 --> 18:09.914
Can I see that?

18:09.916 --> 18:12.800
Wait. Uh, you remember

18:12.802 --> 18:14.919
the nutcase I told you about

18:14.921 --> 18:18.305
who wrote, "I applaud you."

18:22.144 --> 18:25.663
Exact same stationery.

18:29.818 --> 18:32.436
Well, of course
I remember this one.

18:32.438 --> 18:33.938
This is one of his favorites.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.573
I read it to him many times.

18:35.575 --> 18:37.241
When did you receive
these letters?

18:37.243 --> 18:40.444
Oh, a while ago.
At least 3, 4 years.

18:40.446 --> 18:43.697
We found two letters
on this same type of stationery.

18:43.699 --> 18:45.115
Were there any more?

18:45.117 --> 18:47.235
Not that I can recall.

18:47.262 --> 18:48.290
What about the envelopes?

18:48.315 --> 18:50.420
I know I was a long time
ago, but try to think.

18:51.073 --> 18:53.740
Was there a return address?
A postmark?

18:53.742 --> 18:55.509
Hardly anybody
put their address.

18:55.511 --> 18:57.962
Most people didn't even
sign their names.

18:57.964 --> 18:59.430
Well, how come
this is important?

18:59.432 --> 19:00.764
Your husband
quoted those words

19:00.766 --> 19:02.816
moments before
he was executed.

19:04.636 --> 19:06.187
You didn't know that.

19:06.189 --> 19:08.772
No.

19:19.067 --> 19:21.952
Aaron, I think
we've got something.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.937
Two pieces of fan mail
that could be from our unsub.

19:23.939 --> 19:26.490
Can we pull DNA off of
either one of the letters?

19:26.492 --> 19:29.043
No, doubtful.
The mildew damage is significant.

19:29.045 --> 19:31.111
But whoever wrote
these to Garrett

19:31.113 --> 19:33.464
called him an inspiration.

19:33.466 --> 19:34.565
This could be our guy.

19:34.567 --> 19:36.967
We thought the unsub
was trying to usurp Garrett,

19:36.969 --> 19:38.669
but if this was the early
stage of his obsession...

19:38.671 --> 19:40.671
Then he might have
applauded him back then.

19:40.673 --> 19:43.140
It was sometime later that the
student became the master.

19:43.142 --> 19:44.925
It makes sense for the timing
of the first kill.

19:44.927 --> 19:46.510
He was waiting for Garrett
to die.

19:46.512 --> 19:49.463
The king is dead.
Long live the king.

19:49.465 --> 19:52.099
Now he's daring us to stop him
and the clock's still ticking.

19:52.101 --> 19:54.151
We need to give the profile
as soon as possible.

19:54.153 --> 19:56.076
We believe we're looking
for a white male between

19:56.077 --> 19:59.010
the ages of 30 and 40
who is strong enough to subdue

19:59.035 --> 20:01.520
physically fit young women
with minimum resistance.

20:01.861 --> 20:04.995
He's forensically sophisticated
and evidence conscious.

20:04.997 --> 20:07.665
He targets his victims in advance
and he leaves no trail.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.366
This person is also confident.

20:09.368 --> 20:10.501
He's been taunting us

20:10.503 --> 20:13.487
by revealing his
crime scenes quickly.

20:13.489 --> 20:17.424
Because of his ability to plan and
flawlessly execute his crimes,

20:17.426 --> 20:20.427
we're looking for someone
capable of holding down a job,

20:20.429 --> 20:22.856
even though it's probably
menial and unfulfilling.

20:22.857 --> 20:25.438
The victims have all been
young, blond, and pretty.

20:25.439 --> 20:28.590
As such, they reflect a certain
societal standard of perfection

20:28.640 --> 20:29.810
that may actually represent

20:29.835 --> 20:31.835
the type of women that are
unattainable to this unsub.

20:32.475 --> 20:35.509
He cuts his victims' hair
and he takes it with him.

20:35.511 --> 20:38.362
This could be another way for him
to possess a part of them.

20:38.364 --> 20:41.231
Or to degrade
these unattainable women,

20:41.233 --> 20:42.983
make them uglier.

20:42.985 --> 20:45.369
The killer has been
murdering in 6-hour increments.

20:45.371 --> 20:48.405
He is, in effect,
time-stamping his victims.

20:48.407 --> 20:51.241
There's no reason to believe
he will deviate from that now.

20:51.243 --> 20:54.328
Which means the next kill
will be at midnight.

20:54.330 --> 20:57.498
The public needs to be alerted
to stay off the streets

20:57.500 --> 20:58.999
for all non-essential activity.

20:59.001 --> 21:02.920
Single women should not be
in their homes alone.

21:02.922 --> 21:05.306
Every available officer
will be out in full force tonight.

21:05.308 --> 21:07.341
We need to blanket
this city.

21:07.343 --> 21:08.926
We do have one advantage.

21:08.928 --> 21:11.812
A killer who uses this kind of
precise timing and specificity

21:11.814 --> 21:13.097
is easy to disrupt.

21:13.099 --> 21:15.316
We can use his own M.O.
against him.

21:15.318 --> 21:16.600
Thank you.

21:41.026 --> 21:43.627
The police chief has
suggested a citywide curfew,

21:43.629 --> 21:45.796
and although it is not
a mandatory curfew,

21:45.798 --> 21:49.500
the city of Enid tonight
resembles a ghost town.

21:52.587 --> 21:55.105
There's nothing like a serial killer
on the loose to cut down on traffic.

21:55.107 --> 21:56.757
The problem is,
as far as we know,

21:56.759 --> 22:00.944
the unsub strikes from inside
the house, not out in the open.

22:00.946 --> 22:04.481
We have to hope he's not
already in place lying in wait.

22:44.138 --> 22:46.690
I'll be two minutes
grabbing my clothes.

22:46.692 --> 22:49.142
You're a sweetheart
to let me stay the night.

22:49.144 --> 22:52.830
When have I ever said no
to a sleep-over with you?

23:00.756 --> 23:02.623
Hi, mom.

23:02.625 --> 23:04.658
Yes, I heard,

23:04.660 --> 23:06.460
and I've seen the news,

23:06.462 --> 23:09.012
and I'm staying
the night with a friend.

23:09.014 --> 23:11.882
Go get the beer.

23:11.884 --> 23:14.167
A friend, that's all.

23:14.169 --> 23:17.387
No, I don't think
you've met her.

23:17.389 --> 23:19.807
We go to school
together.

23:19.809 --> 23:23.694
Yes, mom, she's fine.
I promise.

23:36.958 --> 23:38.826
Yes, mom.

23:38.828 --> 23:42.579
I'll call you first thing
in the morning. Promise.

23:43.882 --> 23:44.915
Uhh!

23:44.917 --> 23:46.500
Gary, what's--
Oh, my God!

23:46.502 --> 23:47.835
Oh, my God!

23:47.837 --> 23:50.888
Help! Somebody help me!

23:54.176 --> 23:55.509
Ohh!

23:55.511 --> 23:57.678
Hey! What the hell's
going on out there?!

23:57.680 --> 23:59.179
What you got, Garcia?

23:59.181 --> 24:01.148
I have found a thing of interest
regarding these shanking attempts

24:01.150 --> 24:02.215
made on Garrett in prison.

24:02.217 --> 24:04.067
- What is it?
- The timing.

24:04.069 --> 24:07.855
See, the first time Garrett was
attacked was May 25, 2008.

24:07.857 --> 24:10.958
The day before that, May 24
for those of you keeping score,

24:10.960 --> 24:13.927
Garrett's imminent execution
date was postponed, right?

24:13.929 --> 24:17.498
So then if you flash forward
to the second shanking attempt

24:17.500 --> 24:21.618
of stabbiness, that would be
November 15, 2010.

24:21.620 --> 24:22.853
The day before that,

24:22.855 --> 24:25.756
his next execution date,
also postponed.

24:25.758 --> 24:27.240
I'm gonna go out
on a limb here

24:27.242 --> 24:30.260
and say that someone decided to
take matters into their own hands.

24:30.262 --> 24:32.462
Thanks, Garcia.
Ever welcome, my comrades.

24:32.464 --> 24:34.298
Well, that sounds like
what you would think

24:34.300 --> 24:36.300
of somebody on the outside
wanting a little revenge.

24:36.302 --> 24:38.071
They wouldn't wait 5 years,
give it two tries,

24:38.096 --> 24:40.096
and then toss in the towel.

24:40.105 --> 24:43.757
It sounds to me like someone just
needed Rod Garrett out of the way.

24:43.759 --> 24:46.777
But Garrett was on death row
confined to his cell 23 hours a day.

24:46.779 --> 24:48.362
How was he in anybody's way?

24:48.364 --> 24:50.480
Since we're on the subject of things
that don't make sense,

24:50.482 --> 24:52.584
the unsub left the doors open
after the murders.

24:52.587 --> 24:55.772
Ok, that's directed at law enforcement--
catch me if you can.

24:56.789 --> 24:59.656
But the cutting of the hair.

24:59.658 --> 25:01.158
That's for Garrett.

25:01.410 --> 25:03.250
Well, what makes
you think that?

25:03.251 --> 25:05.285
Garrett chose victims
who were easy prey--

25:05.287 --> 25:07.671
drug addicts and prostitutes.
But this unsub has chosen

25:07.673 --> 25:09.739
more difficult targets
but gone to the trouble

25:09.741 --> 25:12.008
of making them look like
Garrett's victims.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.910
That's his way of telling Garrett,
"I can do better than you."

25:13.912 --> 25:17.097
Ok, but why wait until after
the execution to start killing?

25:17.099 --> 25:19.916
If the unsub really wanted to
thumb his nose at Garrett,

25:19.918 --> 25:21.685
wouldn't he want him
to be alive to see it?

25:21.687 --> 25:24.971
Exactly. That's
the doesn't make sense part.

25:24.973 --> 25:26.656
Then we're missing
something.

25:28.592 --> 25:31.528
All units, report
of an abduction

25:31.530 --> 25:33.830
in the vicinity
of Canwood and Harbart.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.548
Suspect fled in a car.
No description of the vehicle.

25:35.550 --> 25:38.118
Canwood? That's
two blocks from here.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.652
Hold on!

25:49.947 --> 25:53.343
We've got a dark-colored
4-door sedan moving

25:53.344 --> 25:54.284
at a high rate of speed

25:54.285 --> 25:57.670
north on Van Buren.
We're in pursuit.

26:12.987 --> 26:14.303
Look out!

26:24.815 --> 26:27.667
Get out of the car! Put your hands
where I can see them!

26:27.669 --> 26:30.203
No, it just--I--I was just
trying to go after him.

26:30.205 --> 26:32.038
I was trying to follow.
Somebody took her.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.381
Aah! Aah!

26:41.383 --> 26:42.799
Help! Help!

27:00.588 --> 27:01.871
Thanks.

27:01.873 --> 27:03.656
Prentiss, the unsub
must have broken in,

27:03.658 --> 27:05.175
saw nobody was home
and then waited.

27:05.177 --> 27:07.510
Well, he didn't expect
the victim to have a companion.

27:07.512 --> 27:08.721
By putting the warning out,

27:08.746 --> 27:11.043
we messed up his plans.
He had to improvise.

27:15.187 --> 27:16.769
Garcia? Garcia.

27:16.771 --> 27:17.971
Hey, are you awake?

27:17.973 --> 27:19.272
Oh, my God.

27:19.274 --> 27:21.524
I'm so awake.
It's 2:30 in the morning.

27:21.526 --> 27:23.893
This is when I hit my stride.
I'm awake right now.

27:23.895 --> 27:25.528
I'm lying. I fell asleep.
What do you need?

27:25.530 --> 27:27.180
Emily Sisk.

27:27.182 --> 27:31.017
She lives on the opposite end
of the city from the first 3 victims.

27:31.019 --> 27:33.186
So since it's not a shared
neighborhood anymore,

27:33.188 --> 27:36.039
is there anything else that
connects all of these women?

27:36.041 --> 27:39.209
Are you familiar with the term,
the six degrees of separation?

27:39.211 --> 27:41.211
I am currently up to...

27:41.213 --> 27:43.313
15 degrees of separation

27:43.315 --> 27:46.249
and I cannot find any connection
with the victims.

27:46.251 --> 27:48.718
But I am going to drink
more mate and keep trying.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.470
Ok, thanks.

28:12.743 --> 28:14.694
Hotch, I think I found her.

28:14.696 --> 28:15.828
You're on speaker,
Prentiss.

28:15.830 --> 28:17.280
The unsub
must have circled back.

28:17.282 --> 28:20.533
He dumped her just outside
the perimeter of the abduction site.

28:20.535 --> 28:22.085
Same M.O.?

28:22.087 --> 28:25.421
No. She's got stab wounds
all over her torso. It's bad.

28:25.423 --> 28:29.175
And, Hotch, this time
he removed her scalp.

28:29.177 --> 28:30.877
Overkill. He must be enraged

28:30.879 --> 28:33.429
he wasn't able to carry
the murder out as planned.

28:33.431 --> 28:35.414
So now we might have
another problem.

28:35.416 --> 28:37.350
If our unsub's blueprint
is out the window,

28:37.352 --> 28:40.103
this may transition him
into a spree killer.

28:52.483 --> 28:54.734
I never could do that.

28:54.736 --> 28:56.035
Do what?

28:56.037 --> 28:58.604
Take a nap.
Never felt natural.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.864
I'm actually wide awake,.
but for future reference,

29:00.865 --> 29:03.294
polyphasic sleep
is completely natural,

29:03.295 --> 29:06.462
quite common in the animal
world, and highly beneficial.

29:06.464 --> 29:09.916
All right, 6:00's
way come and gone.

29:09.918 --> 29:11.384
If our guy's killed again,

29:11.386 --> 29:13.469
he's not leaving
the front door open anymore.

29:13.471 --> 29:15.288
Or he could just be
taking a breather.

29:15.290 --> 29:16.673
I mean, even the unsub
has to realize

29:16.675 --> 29:19.125
that he can't keep up
this pace indefinitely.

29:19.127 --> 29:21.511
Maybe the last murder
completed some sort of cycle.

29:21.513 --> 29:23.479
A day and night have passed.

29:23.481 --> 29:28.151
The sun rises for the first time
in a world without Rod Garrett.

29:28.153 --> 29:31.020
There could also be
a more mundane reason.

29:31.022 --> 29:34.473
Our guy's got a job and
yesterday was his day off.

29:34.475 --> 29:36.309
He killed his first 3
victims in their homes,

29:36.311 --> 29:39.329
but the last victim, Emily Sisk,
he tried to but couldn't.

29:39.331 --> 29:40.830
So he abducted her,
took her somewhere else,

29:40.832 --> 29:42.498
and then brought her all the
way back to dump her body

29:42.500 --> 29:44.000
in front of
her apartment building.

29:44.002 --> 29:47.420
That's incredibly risky given
the increased police presence.

29:47.422 --> 29:49.922
There's gotta be a geographic
component to the unsub's design.

29:49.924 --> 29:50.990
Let's connect the dots,

29:50.992 --> 29:53.042
literally.

29:58.465 --> 30:01.718
A tip of a spear.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.188
Or maybe it's an arrow
pointing south?

30:05.190 --> 30:07.023
Could he be steering us
to his next victim?

30:07.025 --> 30:09.675
It's a quadrilateral, but there's
nothing particularly symbolic

30:09.677 --> 30:11.361
about a 4-sided
concave polygon.

30:11.363 --> 30:14.280
Hey, Spence. May I?

30:15.232 --> 30:16.849
See what happens

30:16.851 --> 30:19.369
when you add a curve
to the lines?

30:19.371 --> 30:21.120
A heart.

30:21.122 --> 30:24.123
Well, Garrett and the unsub
both killed their victims

30:24.125 --> 30:25.842
using stab wounds
through the heart.

30:25.844 --> 30:29.479
And Garrett was executed
by a shot through the heart.

30:33.884 --> 30:36.302
Helen Garrett.

30:37.304 --> 30:39.238
It's all about her.

30:41.592 --> 30:43.726
Helen's not answering her phone,
and there's no voicemail.

30:43.728 --> 30:45.678
Local police
are en route.

30:45.680 --> 30:48.765
Ok. Garcia's combing through
Helen's contacts

30:48.767 --> 30:50.266
to see where
she might have gone.

31:16.076 --> 31:17.743
Clear!

31:17.745 --> 31:18.911
Clear.

31:18.913 --> 31:20.546
Clear.
There's nobody home.

31:20.548 --> 31:23.933
No evidence of a struggle.
Maybe he hasn't made his move yet.

31:24.935 --> 31:26.585
What have you got, Garcia?

31:26.587 --> 31:28.587
Sir, Helen Garrett
is telling the truth.

31:28.589 --> 31:30.723
There are no friends
or family in the area.

31:30.725 --> 31:32.591
She has a painfully
solitary life,

31:32.593 --> 31:34.260
like no social interaction.

31:34.262 --> 31:35.812
Lives alone,
works from home,

31:35.814 --> 31:37.480
then goes to see
her husband in prison.

31:37.482 --> 31:39.449
So it's like home and then prison.
And that's it, period.

31:39.451 --> 31:41.767
She's not at her house.
What about the prison?

31:41.769 --> 31:44.787
Let me check records
right now.

31:44.789 --> 31:47.290
Oh. She went to the prison
this morning one last time

31:47.292 --> 31:48.941
to pick up her husband's
personal items.

31:48.943 --> 31:49.959
Is she there now?

31:49.961 --> 31:52.779
Records indicate that...

31:52.781 --> 31:55.298
She got there at 10:05--

31:55.300 --> 31:57.533
damn, she checked out
like 4 minutes ago--10:37.

31:57.535 --> 32:00.119
All right, call Qarden Hansen,
have him stop her from leaving.

32:00.121 --> 32:02.221
Tell the rest of the team
to go to the prison.

32:02.223 --> 32:03.840
We'll stay here in case
the unsub shows.

32:03.842 --> 32:05.124
Yes, sir.

32:27.998 --> 32:30.333
Helen Garrett's illness was--

32:30.335 --> 32:33.202
her illness was...

32:33.204 --> 32:36.205
Brain tumor. It was successfully
removed. Full recovery.

32:36.207 --> 32:37.656
Did she have
reconstructive surgery?

32:37.658 --> 32:40.042
She had 3 procedures
over the course of 2 years

32:40.044 --> 32:41.711
to repair the damage
to her head.

32:41.713 --> 32:43.662
Wow. Poor lady.

32:43.664 --> 32:47.266
The heart he drew
was a Valentine,

32:47.268 --> 32:49.668
not a bull's-eye. The unsub's
in love with her.

32:49.670 --> 32:52.772
That makes sense. The flowers
missing from the first crime scene,

32:52.774 --> 32:53.973
the bottle of wine.

32:53.975 --> 32:55.525
How did the unsub know
about her surgery?

32:55.527 --> 32:58.811
Helen is an intensely
private and solitary person.

32:58.813 --> 33:01.864
JJ's right. She'd only confide
a detail like that

33:01.866 --> 33:03.132
to someone she trusted.

33:03.134 --> 33:05.201
It takes months
if not years

33:05.203 --> 33:07.303
to build
that kind of trust,

33:07.305 --> 33:08.988
so who had that kind
of time with her?

33:08.990 --> 33:11.690
The same person who'd be
able to witness first-hand

33:11.692 --> 33:13.075
her devotion to Rod Garrett.

33:13.077 --> 33:14.577
The unsub knew she'd
never be available to him

33:14.579 --> 33:17.046
as long as her husband
was still alive.

33:17.048 --> 33:19.643
That's why he tried twice
to kill Garrett in prison.

33:19.645 --> 33:20.757
All right, prison connections

33:20.782 --> 33:22.733
to arrange the attempts
on Garrett's life.

33:23.705 --> 33:26.522
A romantic obsession
years in the making

33:26.524 --> 33:29.025
and the ability
to have long talks

33:29.027 --> 33:32.812
under seemingly
normal circumstances.

33:32.814 --> 33:35.214
It's the prison shuttle driver.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.044
Not yet, Helen.

34:05.046 --> 34:07.746
There's something
I want to show you.

34:24.120 --> 34:25.835
So, nobody saw
what happened,

34:25.877 --> 34:27.560
but Helen's car is still
in the parking lot.

34:27.562 --> 34:28.543
He's got her.

34:28.545 --> 34:29.929
The driver's name
is Dylan Kohler.

34:29.931 --> 34:32.681
He lives at
4488 Harmony Court.

34:32.684 --> 34:33.882
Did he work
yesterday, Warden?

34:33.885 --> 34:35.685
No. He arranged for
someone else to take his shift.

34:35.851 --> 34:37.601
I'll have Garcia
check into Kohler, but now

34:37.603 --> 34:40.219
that he's tipped his hand, I
doubt if he's going back home.

34:45.529 --> 34:48.164
Ok, we're almost there.

34:49.199 --> 34:51.050
We're almost there.

34:53.487 --> 34:57.473
Yeah, Hotch,
they're not here.

34:57.475 --> 35:00.560
Ok. Ok.

35:03.397 --> 35:05.548
You ready?

35:07.101 --> 35:09.635
Why are you doing this?

35:22.866 --> 35:24.500
Sir, I found something else.

35:24.502 --> 35:26.119
Didn't you say
he might be making a wig?

35:26.121 --> 35:27.370
Right.

35:27.372 --> 35:29.739
Ok. So you need very specific
supplies for wig-making.

35:29.741 --> 35:32.875
So I did a search
to see if anyone in Enid

35:32.877 --> 35:34.877
had ordered stuff like
ventilation kits, base nets, hackles,

35:34.879 --> 35:38.247
and it turns out that a D. Kohler
ordered all of these things

35:38.249 --> 35:40.583
and he had them sent
to 500 Hinkson Place.

35:40.585 --> 35:44.270
Guys, that must be
his work space. Let's go.

35:44.272 --> 35:45.938
Do you like it?

35:45.940 --> 35:50.727
I've been planning this since you.
first told me about your scars.

35:50.729 --> 35:51.927
Uh...

35:51.929 --> 35:55.031
Well...Uh...

35:55.033 --> 35:57.450
It's beautiful.

36:00.904 --> 36:03.656
But I already have wigs.

36:03.658 --> 36:06.108
Hey, it's not--
it's not a wig.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.878
Come, look at it.

36:09.830 --> 36:13.499
Every strand, every--

36:13.501 --> 36:16.252
every curl was...

36:16.254 --> 36:19.138
chosen by me.

36:21.291 --> 36:23.626
Harvested by me.

36:23.628 --> 36:28.130
The heads that grew this hair
will never grow hair again.

36:28.132 --> 36:31.234
This cannot be replicated.

36:31.236 --> 36:35.221
And--and it isn't a wig.

36:37.608 --> 36:38.641
It's a living thing.

36:42.979 --> 36:44.997
It's ok.

36:44.999 --> 36:46.332
It's ok.
No, no.

36:46.334 --> 36:48.835
It's ok. It's ok.

37:09.523 --> 37:12.058
Now, wear it.

37:12.060 --> 37:15.895
Let it--let it take root

37:15.897 --> 37:17.613
and grow,

37:17.615 --> 37:21.567
so that it becomes
a part of you.

37:21.569 --> 37:23.319
Why did you do this?

37:23.321 --> 37:25.955
Because I love you.

37:25.957 --> 37:27.290
Helen...

37:28.660 --> 37:30.626
Most people go through life

37:30.628 --> 37:32.862
never knowing
who they really are.

37:32.864 --> 37:37.366
Now, they might sense it,
but they don't trust it.

37:37.368 --> 37:40.586
That was me
before I met you.

37:42.339 --> 37:46.876
You gave me the strength to trust
who I really am deep inside.

37:46.878 --> 37:49.729
I never told you
to kill anyone.

37:49.731 --> 37:52.315
Oh, you didn't have to.

37:52.317 --> 37:54.684
Helen...

37:54.686 --> 37:58.020
Helen, you were destined
to find me.

37:58.022 --> 38:01.824
We were--we were destined
to find each other.

38:01.826 --> 38:03.943
Dylan, back away from her
and show me your hands.

38:03.945 --> 38:05.695
No!
Let her go, Dylan!

38:05.697 --> 38:08.063
There's no way out.

38:08.065 --> 38:10.249
Put the icepick down
and we can talk.

38:10.251 --> 38:12.084
Just let us go, all right?

38:12.086 --> 38:13.903
I--I love her.
I'm not gonna kill anymore.

38:13.920 --> 38:14.989
I promise. I don't need to.

38:14.990 --> 38:16.342
Dylan, you don't want
to hurt her, do you?

38:16.367 --> 38:17.708
No.

38:17.709 --> 38:19.675
Then put the weapon down.

38:19.677 --> 38:23.245
If I do, they'll arrest me
and--and we'll be apart.

38:23.247 --> 38:26.415
After all you've given me,
I won't let that happen.

38:26.417 --> 38:28.351
Did you mean it when you said
you won't kill anymore?

38:28.353 --> 38:32.588
Yes. Yes, there's no need
to kill anymore. It's over.

38:32.590 --> 38:34.891
Ok.

38:36.092 --> 38:39.896
I believe you.

38:39.898 --> 38:41.096
Put down the icepick.

38:41.098 --> 38:44.650
Take your wine
and flowers...

38:44.652 --> 38:45.952
and be happy.

38:47.537 --> 38:48.905
You can't fool me with--

38:48.907 --> 38:51.123
uhh!

39:02.836 --> 39:07.924
No, no, ow! No,
you don't need to do this.

39:07.926 --> 39:09.258
Helen, stop!

39:09.260 --> 39:10.793
Helen! Helen, I love you!

39:10.795 --> 39:12.478
It's true.
Daddy was right.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.814
Daddy was right.

39:22.749 --> 39:25.951
"It is only
in love and murder

39:25.953 --> 39:27.786
that we still remain sincere."

39:27.788 --> 39:30.088
Friedrich Durrenmatt.

39:33.961 --> 39:36.962
Oh, hey, guys. Hey.

39:36.964 --> 39:38.997
I just wanted to see
what's going on. Hi. Hello.

39:38.999 --> 39:40.799
This better be
important, Garcia.

39:40.801 --> 39:43.835
Oh, it's nothing. It's just that a
messenger came by the office today

39:43.837 --> 39:46.221
with some papers from escrow!

39:46.223 --> 39:47.356
No!

39:47.358 --> 39:49.141
Oh, yes. The house
in Du Pont Circle--

39:49.143 --> 39:51.176
you got it! Whoo!

39:51.178 --> 39:52.344
Congratulations.

39:53.529 --> 39:57.366
6 seconds. Fastest case
of buyer's remorse ever.

39:57.368 --> 40:00.518
Well, I say the moment we land
we all head over to Ziggy's

40:00.520 --> 40:02.204
and clear out
the champagne inventory.

40:02.206 --> 40:04.573
And talk Prentiss down
off the ledge.

40:04.575 --> 40:07.075
Oh, my stomach
doesn't feel so hot.

40:08.045 --> 40:10.245
I was in the middle
of the best dream.

40:10.247 --> 40:13.298
I dreamt that I was at this
exclusive salon getting my hair done.

40:13.300 --> 40:15.367
Ah, the psychotherapeutic
benefits of dreams--

40:15.369 --> 40:18.503
purging unpleasant images
and replacing them with good ones.

40:18.505 --> 40:20.505
"Unpleasant"
is putting it mildly.

40:20.507 --> 40:22.808
If someone put a bloody wig
on my head,

40:22.810 --> 40:25.977
I would have ripped that thing
off and kept it off.

40:25.979 --> 40:28.313
Right. You'd think
instinct would take over.

40:28.315 --> 40:31.149
Oh, hey, Rossi,
I meant to ask you,

40:31.151 --> 40:34.186
what did Helen mean at the end
when she said "daddy was right"?

40:35.989 --> 40:38.357
He once told her
that she was a divining rod

40:38.359 --> 40:39.825
for the evil in men.

40:39.827 --> 40:42.744
That she could sniff it out
when nobody else could.

40:42.746 --> 40:46.281
There was definitely something
a little strange about her.

40:46.283 --> 40:50.035
It's curious, one woman at
the center of two serial killers.

40:50.037 --> 40:51.620
Yeah, what are
the odds of that?

40:51.622 --> 40:54.423
Astronomical. Removing from the
calculations serial killer groupies--

40:54.425 --> 40:56.675
Sorry I asked.

40:56.677 --> 40:59.010
You know, whether
she knew it or not,

40:59.012 --> 41:02.080
maybe Helen Garrett
did give Dylan something.

41:06.636 --> 41:11.756
I mean, someone once said
that every seed, even malignant ones...

41:11.758 --> 41:15.026
They won't grow unless
they get water from someplace.

41:17.697 --> 41:19.481
You're here.

41:19.483 --> 41:21.533
Well, of course I am.

41:21.535 --> 41:24.903
My place is here now,
with you.

41:24.905 --> 41:27.539
But...I thought...

41:27.541 --> 41:30.542
We don't ask for the gifts
that we're given, Dylan.

41:30.544 --> 41:32.377
They're just part of us.

41:32.379 --> 41:34.329
This is a duty.

41:34.331 --> 41:36.965
And if I ever doubted before,
I don't now.

41:36.967 --> 41:39.418
This is my calling.

41:39.420 --> 41:42.249
Ever read "A Thousand
and One Nights"?

41:42.250 --> 41:44.250
No, what is it?

41:44.252 --> 41:46.385
Oh, it's a wonderful book.

41:46.387 --> 41:49.222
I think you'll like it.

41:49.224 --> 41:53.342
"She comes like fullest moon
on happy night,

41:53.344 --> 41:56.312
"taper of waist
shaped like magic might,

41:56.314 --> 42:00.316
"her eye hath glances
to quell mankind,

42:00.318 --> 42:03.936
"and Ruby of her cheeks
reflect this light,

42:03.938 --> 42:07.106
"enveils her hips,
the blackness of her hair.

42:07.108 --> 42:11.944
Beware of curls
that bite with viper bite."
