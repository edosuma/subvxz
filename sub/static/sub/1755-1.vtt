04:22.162 --> 04:24.162
 For the past thirty-four years,

04:24.164 --> 04:29.401
my job has given me a front

04:29.403 --> 04:30.836
     As a war correspondent,

     [dramatic music plays]     

04:35.075 --> 04:40.479
Everything that I have achieved 
in my career has come at a high 

04:40.481 --> 04:44.449
price. It cost me my            
relationship with my            

04:44.451 --> 04:51.189
family and my son. I've         
missed Christmases,

for me to re-embed with U.S.    
Troops in                       

05:03.070 --> 05:10.442
Afghanistan, my son, Carlos,    
decided he was coming, with     

05:10.444 --> 05:15.247
or without my permission. He    
said, "I need to know why you   

05:15.249 --> 05:19.584
chose your work over us." As    
much as I wanted to             

05:19.586 --> 05:23.322
say no, I realized this could   
be my last chance               

05:23.324 --> 05:31.330
to reconnect with my son. So    
off we went... together,        

05:31.332 --> 05:36.335
father and son. The             
only trick was...               

05:36.337 --> 05:41.640
we had to come out of           
there alive.

different wires to try          

07:34.054 --> 07:35.687
and make an I.D., maybe         
stretch out the wire            

07:35.689 --> 07:38.490
so they could get further away  
from us, when they

       the Marines take is      

36:05.130 --> 36:10.100

 of setting up this base, in the
       heart of this town

         found an I.E.D.

 We're walking towards it. They 
 cut the command wire,          

36:37.496 --> 36:40.363
 which is a wire that runs to a 
 device that would trigger      

36:40.365 --> 36:45.035

  the only command wire.

  come. The Taliban             

36:57.683 --> 37:02.886

         with my family.        

01:32:07.422 --> 01:32:09.623
 But I have my new family here, 
      so I'll spend quality

    time with my new family.    
          To everybody          

01:32:11.593 --> 01:32:13.960

        been doing here,        

01:32:17.332 --> 01:32:19.799
   and on this Fourth of July?  

01:32:19.801 --> 01:32:23.069
 >> I'd say, uh, to support the 
 troops. It's, uh, it's         

01:32:23.071 --> 01:32:24.538
  pretty tough, being out here. 

01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:27.007
>> We're so blessed with what   
 we have back in the States,    

01:32:27.009 --> 01:32:29.309
    and I just hope everyone
