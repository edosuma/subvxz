Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:39.159 --> 00:40.359
If I'm crazy,

00:40.361 --> 00:41.493
you made me crazier

00:41.495 --> 00:43.528
because your life is broken and boring.

00:43.530 --> 00:45.631
I'm sick and tired of you!
I want you out of my life!

00:45.633 --> 00:46.921
REBECCA: I've officially alienated

00:46.938 --> 00:48.271
every person I know.

00:48.273 --> 00:50.073
I give up.

00:50.075 --> 00:51.474
I'll come home.

00:51.476 --> 00:53.776
Darling, it's time that I take
over the reins of your life.

00:53.778 --> 00:55.078
You're incapable.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.046
You made me think that you loved me.

00:57.821 --> 01:00.016
You gave me hope
when I had none.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.954
And now, that hope is gone.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.048
- Is everything okay?
- I need help.

01:11.180 --> 01:13.180
_

01:16.334 --> 01:18.835
Oh, sorry.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.637
She's okay.

01:21.639 --> 01:23.005
She's out of the woods for now.

01:23.007 --> 01:24.702
- Oh...
- Oh, thank God.

01:24.727 --> 01:26.117
I knew she'd be fine.

01:26.142 --> 01:28.079
The minute I heard,
that's what I told myself.

01:28.104 --> 01:30.376
All right, I got to get back in there.

01:30.618 --> 01:32.413
Dr. Akopian is leaving,

01:32.415 --> 01:34.517
and Rebecca needs somebody in
the room with her at all times.

01:34.542 --> 01:36.946
Uh, they assigned a nurse to be
her “sitter” or something,

01:36.971 --> 01:38.993
but I got rid of her.
And so, now,

01:39.018 --> 01:43.446
all I have to do is fend off
a very overeager housekeeper

01:43.471 --> 01:45.235
who just keeps
interrupting for no reason.

01:45.260 --> 01:46.727
- VALENCIA: Paula.
- Yeah?

01:46.752 --> 01:48.188
You don't have to do this by yourself.

01:48.213 --> 01:49.978
We can help, we can take turns.

01:50.009 --> 01:51.409
Yeah, you have a family at home.

01:51.411 --> 01:52.710
Don't be silly. Rebecca needs me.

01:52.712 --> 01:54.431
And my family will understand.

01:55.595 --> 01:57.181
Actually, there is another
way you guys can help.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.884
So, she knows everyone is
hearing about what happened.

01:59.886 --> 02:01.538
I mean, her phone is blowing up...

02:01.563 --> 02:04.622
Lots of concerned people,
really sweet, very annoying.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.281
Could you please just let
everyone know that she's okay?

02:07.306 --> 02:08.993
I could do it. I'll get
in touch with everyone.

02:08.995 --> 02:09.960
I want to help.

02:09.961 --> 02:11.896
- Oh, great.
- Hey.

02:12.103 --> 02:15.332
- I got here as fast as I could.
- Why?

02:15.923 --> 02:19.170
- Is Rebecca okay?
- For now. Josh, you need to leave.

02:19.501 --> 02:22.306
I can't have Rebecca seeing you
or hearing you.

02:22.331 --> 02:24.314
I don't want her to be upset.

02:24.339 --> 02:26.372
In fact, I am worried

02:26.374 --> 02:28.408
that your body spray is
gonna waft into her room

02:28.410 --> 02:29.909
and she's gonna know that you're here,

02:29.934 --> 02:32.935
so leave... without wafting.

02:34.516 --> 02:35.548
(Paula sighs)

02:35.550 --> 02:37.917
Dude, you should go.

02:37.919 --> 02:39.452
But I want to talk to Rebecca.

02:39.454 --> 02:41.754
I mean, last time I saw her,
we had a really bad fight

02:41.756 --> 02:44.023
and I said I wanted her
to go away, which I did,

02:44.025 --> 02:46.626
but not in, like, a permanent way.

02:47.727 --> 02:49.160
Will you at least tell her I was here?

02:49.996 --> 02:51.957
- No...
- No.

02:52.575 --> 02:55.082
I'm so sorry, Dr. Akopian.

02:56.994 --> 02:58.193
I failed you.

02:59.661 --> 03:02.719
- God, I'm such a coward.
- You were no such thing.

03:02.744 --> 03:03.943
No such thing.

03:03.945 --> 03:06.312
You were brave. You asked for help.

03:06.314 --> 03:08.047
Brave. Asked for help.

03:08.533 --> 03:10.119
Just agreeing with you.

03:12.031 --> 03:14.532
I'll let you get some
rest, but don't worry,

03:14.557 --> 03:17.333
there are some great
psychiatrists on staff here,

03:17.553 --> 03:20.049
and we'll work together
to get you the right help.

03:24.778 --> 03:26.455
Thank you.

03:29.137 --> 03:30.984
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:31.531 --> 03:33.172
Are the girls still here?

Oh, yeah. No, we're all here.

03:47.355 --> 03:49.922
Sweetie, do you need anything?

No, um, no, I think I'm
just gonna go to sleep.

Oh. Oh, God.

Oh, I'm so embarrassed
that I caused such a scene.

04:01.797 --> 04:04.851
And I didn't, I didn't even want to die.

04:05.502 --> 04:07.635
I just wanted the pain to stop.

04:07.942 --> 04:09.675

04:09.984 --> 04:12.612

I was out of stories

04:12.614 --> 04:14.614
to tell myself that
things would be okay.

04:15.523 --> 04:18.117
I just feel like I
inconvenienced a lot of people.

04:18.119 --> 04:20.890
No, no, no, no. No, you didn't.

04:21.422 --> 04:24.524
And don't you worry about
anyone else right now, okay?

04:24.526 --> 04:27.493
- (sniffles) Okay.

09:33.763 --> 09:35.483
Paula?

09:36.037 --> 09:37.870
I know exactly what's
gonna happen today.

09:37.872 --> 09:39.865
Dr. Shin, he's gonna
prescribe me a bunch of meds,

09:39.890 --> 09:42.074
like doctors always do,
and they're not gonna work,

09:42.076 --> 09:43.576
and I'm gonna end up back here.

09:43.578 --> 09:44.910
Wait, wait, wait.

09:44.912 --> 09:46.545
Let's give the guy a chance.

09:46.547 --> 09:49.267
Remember? Dr. Damn... is good people.

09:49.292 --> 09:51.517
Dr. Damn... it's funny
that you call him that.

09:51.519 --> 09:53.586
These are the moments
when I used to laugh.

09:53.963 --> 09:55.888
So, ha, ha, ha, ha.

09:56.259 --> 09:57.723
Hello, Rebecca.

09:57.725 --> 10:01.160
How we feeling today?
“We,” sorry, that's lame doctor-talk.

10:01.162 --> 10:02.695
How are you feeling today?

10:02.697 --> 10:04.530
Um, I, um, all right.

10:04.532 --> 10:06.966
PAULA: So, you're springing
our girl today.

10:06.968 --> 10:08.968
I can't wait to get
her back home with me.

10:08.970 --> 10:10.035
You two live together?

10:10.037 --> 10:11.804
Oh, no, no, no. No,
I live with my husband

10:11.806 --> 10:13.706
and kids, but you know,
my focus is Rebecca

10:13.708 --> 10:15.608
right now, so I will be

10:15.610 --> 10:18.844
driving her and staying with
her and sleeping in her bed.

10:18.846 --> 10:20.499
- In her bed?
- Yes.

10:20.524 --> 10:22.715
Oh, I'm sorry, have you never
had a best friend before?

10:22.717 --> 10:24.350
Because you should talk
to someone about that.

10:24.352 --> 10:27.519
REBECCA: O-Okay, so, um,
all right, Doc, tell me what to do.

10:27.521 --> 10:29.989
Um, first question, how
many meds am I gonna be on?

10:29.991 --> 10:31.924
Uh, can you give me the daytime
version of whatever it is?

10:31.926 --> 10:34.126
Because all of the other
meds I've been prescribed

10:34.128 --> 10:36.110
have made me numb or drowsy or...

10:36.135 --> 10:39.837
Actually, your treatment protocol
is not centered on medication.

10:39.862 --> 10:42.234
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, how is she supposed

10:42.236 --> 10:43.569
to get better with no medicine?

10:43.571 --> 10:46.472
Oh, there may be some, but
it's not the main focus.

10:46.474 --> 10:50.910
Rebecca, in my opinion, you've
been misdiagnosed over the years.

10:50.912 --> 10:53.875
It's one of the main reasons
you've been struggling.

10:53.900 --> 10:57.101
I think, with the right
diagnosis and treatment,

10:57.585 --> 10:58.884
you can get a lot better.

10:59.336 --> 11:01.587
Wait, so you have a
new diagnosis for me?

11:01.589 --> 11:03.689
So I'm not anxious or OCD

11:03.691 --> 11:05.090
or depressed or any of
the vague combo of things

11:05.092 --> 11:06.258
people have told me I am?

11:06.260 --> 11:08.761
- Oh-oh, my God. What am I?
- Great questions,

11:08.763 --> 11:10.396
but I don't want to
get ahead of treatment.

11:10.398 --> 11:12.423
Okay? We're gonna talk about all that

11:12.448 --> 11:15.267
and the steps towards your recovery
later today at the clinic.

11:15.269 --> 11:17.069
Wow, this is huge.

11:17.071 --> 11:19.405
- I'll see you then, okay?
- Okay.

11:19.407 --> 11:21.064
Bye.

11:21.242 --> 11:24.109
Paula, did you hear what he said?

14:28.679 --> 14:30.398
_

14:30.422 --> 14:31.906
Okay. Diagnosis time. Hit me.

14:31.930 --> 14:34.724
Okay. Now, it's
important to keep in mind

14:34.749 --> 14:37.483
that nobody's diagnosis is
simple or covers everything.

14:37.508 --> 14:39.175
- Yep, yep, yep, yep.
- It's also important

14:39.177 --> 14:41.771
to not look up the diagnosis online

14:41.796 --> 14:43.612
before we have a chance
to get into it, okay?

14:43.614 --> 14:45.233
Got it. I will not look up anything,

14:45.258 --> 14:46.791
if you don't want me
to. I'm a good student.

14:46.793 --> 14:48.960
I will stick to the
required reading, sir.

14:48.962 --> 14:52.563
Rebecca, I am noticing
how energetic you are.

14:52.565 --> 14:55.233
That's not uncommon
after a suicidal event.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.569
Too energetic. Sorry. Sorry, um, sorry.

14:58.571 --> 15:01.606
I'm-I'm calm now, this
is my calm, low voice.

15:01.631 --> 15:03.441
Okay, so,

15:03.443 --> 15:06.277
based on my conversation
with Dr. Akopian

15:06.279 --> 15:08.646
and our meetings at the hospital,

15:08.648 --> 15:12.517
it is my belief that, while
you do have some symptoms

15:12.519 --> 15:15.353
of anxiety, depression, OCD

15:15.355 --> 15:16.687
and possibly PTSD...

15:16.689 --> 15:17.922
Right. But I've heard
all those things before,

15:17.924 --> 15:20.158
- and you said this was a new thing.
- I'm still talking.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.893
- Sorry.
- It is my opinion

15:21.895 --> 15:24.195
that you exhibit many
of the characteristics

15:24.197 --> 15:27.265
of borderline personality disorder.

15:28.139 --> 15:31.084
Wow. O-Okay, um...

15:31.383 --> 15:34.184
First question... what is that?

15:34.374 --> 15:38.037
Well, a person with BPD
is essentially someone

15:38.062 --> 15:41.012
who has difficulty
regulating their emotions.

15:41.014 --> 15:45.416
Someone that lacks the
protective emotional skin

15:45.418 --> 15:47.552
to feel comfortable in the world.

15:47.554 --> 15:49.140
Wow.

15:49.483 --> 15:51.759
Um, just a couple questions, um...

15:51.784 --> 15:53.825
How did I get BPD? Is BPD curable?

15:53.827 --> 15:55.827
How serious is BPD?
Is BPD easy to fix?

15:55.829 --> 15:57.795
Is BPD genetic? Did I get
the BPD from my mother?

15:57.797 --> 15:59.630
I got it from my mother, right?
Again, just, like, rapid fire.

15:59.632 --> 16:01.632
Just, like, answer.
Don't think about it.

16:01.634 --> 16:03.434
Okay, I never fall for “rapid fire.”

16:03.436 --> 16:06.771
Rebecca, I know you have a lot
of questions. I understand.

16:06.773 --> 16:08.840
And we'll talk about
it a lot more, luckily,

16:08.842 --> 16:11.108
in your group therapy, which
is where we're headed right now.

16:11.110 --> 16:13.077
So you're just gonna pull a
Yoda and not tell me anything

16:13.079 --> 16:15.279
I want to know before I'm
ready to know it, yeah?

16:15.281 --> 16:16.424
That's what this is?

16:16.950 --> 16:19.650
Hot-ass doctor, telling me not
to look things up online.

16:19.652 --> 16:21.152
Oh, I'm gonna look things up online,

16:21.154 --> 16:22.787
hot-ass doctor. All right.

16:22.789 --> 16:26.591
“What is borderline
personality disorder?”

16:26.593 --> 16:28.793
(exhales)

16:30.174 --> 16:32.174
_

16:32.199 --> 16:34.199

16:34.224 --> 16:35.858

16:35.882 --> 16:37.592

16:37.617 --> 16:39.617
_

16:39.641 --> 16:41.641
_

16:41.741 --> 16:43.007
Nope.

16:43.009 --> 16:45.343
No. No, no, no. No.

16:45.345 --> 16:46.644
So, guys.

16:46.646 --> 16:47.745
Guys, guys, guys.

16:47.747 --> 16:49.780
Day five, part two.

16:49.782 --> 16:52.116
Rebecca is at the outpatient center

16:52.118 --> 16:53.751
getting wonderful treatment.

16:53.753 --> 16:55.553
And meanwhile, back at the ranch,

16:55.555 --> 16:59.156
we've stocked up on all of
her favorite... comfort carbs.

16:59.158 --> 17:01.459
My girl loves her sugar, salt and dough.

17:01.461 --> 17:03.828
Now, all of you supporters out there,

17:03.830 --> 17:06.063
Rebecca's big #Bunchafriends,

17:06.065 --> 17:08.799
I want you to know that
her heart is strong,

17:08.800 --> 17:10.501
her spirit is bright, and she...

17:10.502 --> 17:11.836
Did you tell all your bots

17:11.838 --> 17:13.871
that we had to take all
the knives out of the house?

17:13.873 --> 17:15.406
Also, maybe ask them if they know

17:15.407 --> 17:18.075
how to jailbreak an
avocado, because I do not.

17:18.077 --> 17:19.175
Heather, we're live.

17:19.178 --> 17:20.444
- Okay.
- (door opens)

17:20.445 --> 17:21.545
Oh, my God, guys, she's here.

17:21.547 --> 17:23.681
Guys, guys, guys, let's see how it went.

17:23.683 --> 17:26.284
(door closes)

17:26.286 --> 17:30.154
- Okay, let's put that away.
- (phone beeps)

17:30.156 --> 17:34.525
REBECCA: So, um, I got the worst
diagnosis ever, basically, um...

17:34.527 --> 17:35.826
Yeah, I really hate it.

17:35.828 --> 17:38.529
It's, uh, called borderline
personality disorder,

17:38.531 --> 17:40.765
and I read two and a
half sentences about it,

17:40.767 --> 17:42.300
and they were the worst sentences ever,

17:42.302 --> 17:44.068
and I don't want to know any more.

17:44.070 --> 17:46.581
(crying): And it's all just awful.

17:46.606 --> 17:48.506
(phone beeps)

17:48.508 --> 17:49.907
(mouthing)

17:49.909 --> 17:51.809
Oh, my God. Stop.

17:52.612 --> 17:56.013
“Wishing you the best

17:56.015 --> 17:59.517

18:07.961 --> 18:09.446
Yeah.

18:17.570 --> 18:19.603
(exhales)

18:19.605 --> 18:21.806
(panting)

18:29.415 --> 18:31.382
- (groans)
- What's up, boss?

18:31.384 --> 18:32.984
Uh, nothing.

18:32.986 --> 18:36.732
Uh, just had a little
weird déjà vu moment.

18:37.090 --> 18:38.589
So glad you called me in...

18:38.591 --> 18:41.092
- I did no such thing.
- ... because we are planning

18:41.094 --> 18:43.160
to visit Rebecca at home this weekend.

18:43.162 --> 18:46.263
I'm kind of nervous,
'cause I'm terrible with death.

18:46.265 --> 18:47.765
When I was a kid, my dog died.

18:47.767 --> 18:52.343
- I was the one who found him,
- all, like, splayed out,

18:52.952 --> 18:55.906
eyes rolled into the back of his head,

18:55.908 --> 18:57.475
his tongue hanging out.

18:57.477 --> 18:58.809
It's, like, burned into my brain...

18:58.811 --> 18:59.944
Stop it!

18:59.946 --> 19:01.679
Oh.

19:01.681 --> 19:03.014
I'm sorry.

19:03.016 --> 19:04.682
Don't worry about me.

19:04.684 --> 19:07.518
I'm a cat guy now.
I have a cat named Andromeda...

19:07.520 --> 19:09.053
I got to go.

19:09.055 --> 19:10.287
Are... you...

19:10.289 --> 19:11.555
Just get out of my office.

19:11.557 --> 19:13.057
Okay, well.

19:14.228 --> 19:17.628
So you didn't go to group
therapy, you just blew it off?

19:17.630 --> 19:18.863
No, I didn't go.

19:18.865 --> 19:20.587
I was too upset.

19:20.967 --> 19:24.635
I mean, I don't have an illness,
I have a personality disorder.

19:24.892 --> 19:28.305
It's not something I
have, it's something I am.

19:28.307 --> 19:30.908
This is what I've feared
my whole life. I'm broken.

19:30.910 --> 19:34.311
Honey, what did I say to
you over and over in the car?

19:34.313 --> 19:35.479
You are not broken.

19:35.481 --> 19:36.714
You're wonderful.

19:36.716 --> 19:37.882
VALENCIA: She's right.

19:37.884 --> 19:40.251
You are an inspiration
to hundreds of people.

19:40.253 --> 19:42.720
There is a Facebook group in Venezuela

19:42.722 --> 19:44.755
that's completely devoted to you.

19:44.757 --> 19:47.324
It's called El Buncho Valiente.

19:47.326 --> 19:49.393
Oh, my God, seriously, stop.

19:49.395 --> 19:52.263
Okay, listen, Rebecca, if you
hate this diagnosis so much,

19:52.265 --> 19:55.132
then, let's get a second opinion.

19:55.398 --> 19:57.268
Second opinions are very common.

19:57.270 --> 19:59.070
And, you know, this new doctor,

19:59.072 --> 20:00.805
he just met you.

20:00.807 --> 20:02.406
He doesn't know you yet.

20:02.408 --> 20:04.275
And who says we just have to sit here

20:04.277 --> 20:07.311
and accept his diagnosis
with a capital “D”?

20:07.313 --> 20:09.547
We don't have to just take his “D.”

20:09.549 --> 20:11.015
Who says his “D" is so great?

20:11.017 --> 20:12.550
No, you're right. He
should get to know me better

20:12.552 --> 20:14.318
before he shoves his
“D” down my throat.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.553
Yeah. What we should do,

20:15.555 --> 20:17.254
is get another “D.”

20:17.256 --> 20:19.323
And then we'll have two Ds.

20:19.325 --> 20:20.758
You know, one here, and one there,

20:20.760 --> 20:22.059
and we'll just...

20:22.061 --> 20:25.929
- figure out which “D” you like better.
- Okay, let's calm down.

20:25.954 --> 20:29.233
Rebecca, we can ask Dr. Akopian.

20:29.235 --> 20:32.236
Oh, my God, Paula, you're totally right.

20:32.238 --> 20:33.871
I mean, she knows me
way better than Dr. Shin,

20:33.873 --> 20:36.807
and she never said anything
about a personality disorder.

20:36.809 --> 20:38.509
I mean, she likes me a lot.

20:38.511 --> 20:41.779
I-I thought Dr. Akopian
consulted with Dr. Damn

20:41.781 --> 20:43.581
on your diagnosis?

20:43.583 --> 20:45.850
She may have, but... no.

20:45.852 --> 20:48.152
I-If she knew how much
I hated this diagnosis,

20:48.154 --> 20:50.254
and how upset it was
making me, she'd be pissed.

20:50.256 --> 20:52.223
I mean, Dr. Akopian only
wants me to be happy,

20:52.225 --> 20:54.204
and this is not what happy feels like.

20:54.229 --> 20:56.594
All right. Let's go. I'll drive.

20:56.596 --> 20:58.462
Okay.

20:58.464 --> 21:00.564
I do recommend an appointment.

21:00.566 --> 21:02.867
Maybe don't crawl
through her doggie door.

21:02.869 --> 21:07.037
Hmm. How do I spin this
for the worldwide audience?

21:07.039 --> 21:08.305
- (door closes)
- (phone beeps)

21:08.307 --> 21:09.440
Oh...

21:09.442 --> 21:11.642
(piano playing softly)

21:12.378 --> 21:14.245
- (knocking on door)
- (door opens)

21:14.247 --> 21:15.579
Father. Mother.

21:15.581 --> 21:17.248
Nathaniel, martini time
cannot be interrupted.

21:17.250 --> 21:18.649
The timing is crucial.

21:18.651 --> 21:19.950
That skin of ice on the top,

21:19.952 --> 21:21.352
it melts in seconds.
Melts. I know, I know.

21:21.354 --> 21:23.187
Oh, it's okay, darling.
He came all this way.

21:23.189 --> 21:24.388
What is it, Nathaniel?

21:24.390 --> 21:25.744
W-Would you like a martini?

21:25.769 --> 21:29.426
- No, no. I need answers.
- I don't like your tone.

21:29.744 --> 21:31.061
Mom.

21:31.455 --> 21:33.898
When I was ten, did you
try to kill yourself?

21:34.507 --> 21:36.340
Not now, Bernice!

21:37.547 --> 21:38.880
Did you?

21:45.643 --> 21:47.677
NATHANIEL: I have this... memory.

21:47.679 --> 21:50.012
I was ten years old, and I
heard something fall over.

21:50.014 --> 21:52.315
And I went to your room, and I saw you,

21:52.317 --> 21:55.528
Mom, passed out on the floor.
And your eyes

21:55.553 --> 21:58.321
were rolling back in your head.
And I tried to wake you up...

21:58.323 --> 21:59.422
Nathaniel, enough.

21:59.424 --> 22:00.823
And Dad told me to go
to my room, and I did.

22:00.825 --> 22:03.359
And then the next thing
I know, you were gone

22:03.361 --> 22:05.094
for, like, a month. And everyone said,

22:05.096 --> 22:06.763
“Don't talk about it.
Don't ask questions.”

22:06.765 --> 22:08.097
So I didn't.

22:08.787 --> 22:10.733
But now I really need
to know what happened.

22:10.735 --> 22:12.268
You know what happened.

22:12.270 --> 22:14.470
Your mother had the
flu and got dehydrated,

22:14.472 --> 22:16.229
so she went sailing for a month

22:16.254 --> 22:19.041
- with your Aunt Sissy in Rhode Island.
- That's right.

22:19.043 --> 22:21.377
I brought you back that
anchor key chain, remember?

22:21.379 --> 22:23.731
It wasn't the flu. Come on.

22:23.756 --> 22:25.989
There were sleeping
pills. There was a bottle

22:26.014 --> 22:28.418
of pills on your nightstand,
and you wouldn't wake up.

22:28.420 --> 22:30.653
We told you what happened.
This conversation is over.

22:30.655 --> 22:32.287
It's not over.

22:33.224 --> 22:35.992
Look, I need to know the truth.

22:35.994 --> 22:37.660
My friend just tried to kill herself,

22:37.662 --> 22:39.228
and I can't reach out to her at all,

22:39.230 --> 22:41.197
because every time I think about her,

22:41.199 --> 22:43.900
I picture this... lifeless body.

22:43.925 --> 22:45.752
And it makes me think of you that night.

22:45.777 --> 22:48.908
And I get panicked and I can't breathe.

22:48.933 --> 22:50.500
And I don't know what that is.

22:50.502 --> 22:53.136
And, I'm sorry, also, who
goes sailing for a month

22:53.138 --> 22:54.804
when they have the
flu? That's not a thing.

22:54.806 --> 22:56.105
That's a terrible lie.

22:56.107 --> 22:59.842
- Please tell me the truth.
- Nathaniel, stop this now.

22:59.844 --> 23:01.778
This isn't how we raised you.

23:02.958 --> 23:04.539
Mom?

23:07.578 --> 23:08.951
Please.

23:09.484 --> 23:12.588
Oh, Nathaniel, I hate
to see you so upset.

23:12.804 --> 23:16.659
But it's-it's just so
unpleasant to dredge up the past.

23:16.661 --> 23:18.428
(clears throat) Now,

23:18.430 --> 23:20.096
why don't you join us for dinner.

23:20.098 --> 23:21.431
We're having lamb tonight.

23:21.433 --> 23:23.499
And-and then you can
come out and see my roses.

23:23.501 --> 23:24.467
They're looking

23:24.469 --> 23:25.501
so healthy...

23:25.503 --> 23:26.869
Will you please just answer me?!

23:30.108 --> 23:31.607
(sighs)

23:31.609 --> 23:34.944
(exhales) I think I'd
better go lie down.

23:34.946 --> 23:37.246
I suddenly have a terrible headache.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.958
Mom, I'm sorry. I...

23:42.716 --> 23:43.989
You upset her.

23:44.716 --> 23:45.822
Something's happened to you

23:45.824 --> 23:48.024
since you started working
in that new office.

23:48.026 --> 23:49.759
You're getting peppery,

23:49.761 --> 23:51.894
and I don't use that word lightly.

23:51.896 --> 23:55.062
Now, congratulations,
you've ruined our evening.

23:55.087 --> 23:57.366
And we were having lamb.

23:57.368 --> 23:58.952
Get out of my house.

24:02.273 --> 24:05.708
VALENCIA: So, guys, I want to
send a special thank you

24:05.710 --> 24:07.643
to Shimmer Glimmer
Cosmetics for sending over

24:07.645 --> 24:10.747
those amazing and gorgeous
lip glosses to Rebecca.

24:10.749 --> 24:14.650
I'm wearing one right now,
and she is going to love them.

24:14.652 --> 24:15.952
There's nothing wrong
with a little pampering

24:15.954 --> 24:17.820
in a tough time... Just
plain ol' self-care.

24:17.822 --> 24:19.622
And, remember, if you
don't like the shade,

24:19.624 --> 24:21.157
Shimmer Glimmer will
send you a different one

24:21.159 --> 24:22.658
- for free... Wait. Okay.
- No, that's enough. I've had it.

24:22.660 --> 24:25.084
- Wait, no! (grunts)
- I've had it. I'm going to murder you.

24:25.109 --> 24:27.196
What is wrong with you?

24:27.198 --> 24:30.299
You're using your friend's
crisis to get swag?

24:30.770 --> 24:33.669
I mean, not to judge, V, like, at all,

24:33.671 --> 24:36.639
but what you're doing is
pathetic and vain and stupid

24:36.641 --> 24:39.245
and cringey and trendy
and selfish and basic.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.711
(gasps) Oh, my God. Wait, hold up.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.346
You think this is about me?

24:43.348 --> 24:45.948
- Yes.
- Are you blind?

24:45.950 --> 24:49.652
This has way transcended any one person.

24:49.654 --> 24:52.155
Rebecca's story and her courage

24:52.157 --> 24:54.257
and my courage sharing her courage

24:54.259 --> 24:56.359
is inspiring an entire movement.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.427
And that's what people want to feel...

24:58.429 --> 25:00.763
Inspired, not sad.

25:00.765 --> 25:02.365
And that is what I give them...

25:02.367 --> 25:04.233
Hope and joy

25:04.235 --> 25:06.469
and, yes, makeup tips and gorgeous hair.

25:06.471 --> 25:07.804
Oh, my God, you're so full of it.

know. But it's an emergency.

REBECCA: Okay, and I know that
Dr. Shin consulted with you,

28:25.350 --> 28:27.517
but I think he tricked you
into giving me that diagnosis

28:27.519 --> 28:29.419
by mansplaining you into it.

28:29.421 --> 28:32.288
Rebecca, did you talk to Dr. Shin?

28:32.290 --> 28:35.125
- Did you go to your group therapy?
- No, I did not.

28:48.573 --> 28:50.707
Give it to me straight.

28:50.709 --> 28:52.609
What is Rebecca saying about me?

28:52.611 --> 28:54.044
I've been there basically every day.

28:54.046 --> 28:55.645
Haven't heard your name once.

28:55.647 --> 28:56.813
You don't have to shield me.

28:56.815 --> 28:58.248
I can take it.

28:58.506 --> 29:02.018
I am responsible for someone
almost taking their life.

29:02.194 --> 29:04.554
Look, from what I picked
up in the hospital...

29:04.556 --> 29:06.189
And I'm in the inner circle;

29:06.191 --> 29:07.724
I provide snacks, advice,

29:07.726 --> 29:10.160
and an outlet for
Valencia's aggression...

29:10.162 --> 29:12.095
Being suicidal has nothing to do

29:12.097 --> 29:14.130
with any one life event or person.

29:14.132 --> 29:17.000
It's more of a general
mental illness thing.

29:17.002 --> 29:19.335
Um, yeah. Well, Rebecca
has been obsessed with me

29:19.337 --> 29:21.738
since she was 16. I ruined her.

29:21.740 --> 29:24.974
Suicide is a cardinal sin,
and I almost sin-assisted.

29:24.976 --> 29:26.309
No, this is on me, man.

29:26.311 --> 29:27.977
I-I've got to do something,

29:27.979 --> 29:29.946
see Rebecca, make things right.

29:29.948 --> 29:30.947
(sighs)

29:30.949 --> 29:32.315
Or you don't.

29:32.317 --> 29:33.349
Or I do.

29:33.351 --> 29:34.350
Or you really don't.

29:34.352 --> 29:35.218
I do, though.

29:35.220 --> 29:36.586
I don't think you really do.

29:36.588 --> 29:39.022
Except that I do, I think.

29:39.024 --> 29:40.056
I don't think so.

29:40.058 --> 29:41.591
AKOPIAN: Rebecca, it sounds

29:41.593 --> 29:44.828
like you don't have accurate
information about borderline.

29:44.830 --> 29:47.997
Dr. Shin asked you not
to look it up online,

29:47.999 --> 29:50.700
- but I'm suspecting that you did.
- So what?

29:50.702 --> 29:52.635
Yeah, I did. So what? All right.

29:52.637 --> 29:55.139
Why don't we take a sec
and look at the checklist,

29:55.164 --> 29:56.773
see if anything resonates.

29:56.775 --> 29:58.475
- What checklist?
- To determine

29:58.477 --> 30:00.610
whether or not a person has BPD.

30:02.124 --> 30:05.715
A checklist sounds like
homework. You like homework.

30:05.717 --> 30:07.984
Wait, why don't we just hear
it and then see what we think?

30:07.986 --> 30:10.285
I mean, I am right here.
I am right next to you.

30:10.310 --> 30:12.522
Yes, you are.

30:12.524 --> 30:14.724
Which is a whole nother
thing we should talk about.

30:14.726 --> 30:16.126
- I don't... I don't...
- All right,

30:16.128 --> 30:18.461
in order to receive a diagnosis for BPD,

30:18.463 --> 30:20.530
a person has to have at least five

30:20.532 --> 30:22.565
of the following nine tendencies.

30:22.567 --> 30:24.334
Just keep an open mind.

30:24.336 --> 30:27.337
Okay? Okay, the first one is

30:27.339 --> 30:29.906
severe mood swings.

30:29.908 --> 30:31.474
♪ ♪

30:31.476 --> 30:33.376
(chuckles) Well, we'll see about that.

30:33.378 --> 30:34.544
(both laugh)

30:34.546 --> 30:36.913
We'll see about that.

30:37.829 --> 30:40.483
Profound fear of abandonment.

30:40.875 --> 30:43.609
Josh. Hey, no, Josh!

30:44.343 --> 30:47.223
Instability in relationships.

30:47.225 --> 30:50.226
It's like you think I'm your
daughter or something, but I'm not.

30:51.563 --> 30:53.554
Unstable sense of identity.

30:53.579 --> 30:56.266
I don't know who I am if
you're not in my life anymore.

30:57.572 --> 31:00.807
Paranoia or dissociative episodes.

31:01.106 --> 31:03.106
What? Robert.

31:03.108 --> 31:04.108
No!

31:05.810 --> 31:08.011
Excessive and frequent anger.

31:08.013 --> 31:09.646
Stop running, you coward!

31:10.982 --> 31:13.116
Feelings of emptiness.

31:13.118 --> 31:16.019
My womb is empty, like my life.

31:17.522 --> 31:18.955
Impulsive behavior.

31:18.957 --> 31:20.657
(moaning)

31:24.444 --> 31:25.895
And, finally,

31:25.897 --> 31:30.033
recurring suicide threats or attempts.

31:31.818 --> 31:33.816
Oh, my God.

31:34.773 --> 31:35.939
I know.

31:35.941 --> 31:37.540
So not you, right?

31:37.542 --> 31:38.841
(chuckles)

31:38.843 --> 31:40.410
Paula,

31:40.511 --> 31:42.344
all those things were me.

31:43.051 --> 31:45.574
I don't have five... I have nine.

31:46.218 --> 31:48.618
(sighs)

31:55.062 --> 31:57.629
(crickets chirping)

31:58.897 --> 32:01.635
Hey. How'd it go?
Did you get a new diagnosis?

32:01.660 --> 32:03.433
No. Uh, same one.

32:03.435 --> 32:05.826
But it's right.

32:06.357 --> 32:09.739
Yeah, the verdict's in.
I am officially, medically,

32:09.741 --> 32:12.990
certifiably “crazy.”

32:13.378 --> 32:15.445
Well, no one said anything about crazy.

32:15.447 --> 32:19.048
Um, so, look, I-I
appreciate everyone's support.

32:19.050 --> 32:20.650
And I love you guys. I really do. But...

32:20.652 --> 32:23.762
I'm very tired, so...
I'm just gonna go to bed.

32:25.614 --> 32:26.926
Alone.

32:36.925 --> 32:39.392
I'm sure she just needs to rest.

32:39.504 --> 32:41.271
(door lock clicks)

32:51.755 --> 32:53.942
Good morning, Mother.
Nathaniel, you're back.

32:54.255 --> 32:55.988
I waited for Dad to leave.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.153
Mom, I came back

32:58.155 --> 32:59.487
because I wanted to apologize

32:59.489 --> 33:01.122
for how I acted last night.

33:01.124 --> 33:02.691
Oh, no, that's okay.

33:02.693 --> 33:04.459
I know you don't like
to rehash the past,

33:04.461 --> 33:06.040
and I respect that.

33:07.181 --> 33:10.081
I'm not trying to make
you feel bad, really.

33:10.986 --> 33:14.939
I know we don't say this stuff
in our house, but...

33:19.684 --> 33:21.828
I love you, Mom.

33:22.245 --> 33:25.608
And I want you to know
that if you ever need me,

33:25.918 --> 33:27.651
I'm here.

33:29.578 --> 33:31.077
And you're right...

33:31.298 --> 33:33.264
These roses, they really are beautiful.

33:36.656 --> 33:38.210
Nathaniel, wait.

33:41.161 --> 33:44.869
When you were ten, I was
going through a hard time.

33:46.576 --> 33:49.251
I made a mistake with my sleeping pills.

33:50.580 --> 33:52.036
Then I went away for a while

33:52.038 --> 33:55.908
to a place where I learned
to sleep without pills.

33:57.877 --> 34:02.298
There was some sailing there. Not much.

34:03.793 --> 34:05.705
Anyway, you're right.

34:06.142 --> 34:07.685
I should have told you.

34:09.275 --> 34:10.420
Wow.

34:14.726 --> 34:16.527
Did we just have a talk?

34:17.469 --> 34:20.031
- I think we did.
- (both laughing)

34:20.033 --> 34:23.034
- (gasps) Don't tell your father.
- Oh, no, I won't.

34:23.036 --> 34:25.726
Do you want to take some of
these roses to your friend?

34:26.302 --> 34:28.168
I think she'd like them.

34:35.215 --> 34:36.813
What are you guys doing?

34:36.815 --> 34:39.150
- Oh...
- (groans)

34:39.152 --> 34:41.052
Um, just having a sleepover.

34:41.331 --> 34:44.722
Yeah, the floor's so
cozy, I slept great.

34:44.724 --> 34:46.690
All right, guys,
sorry, I got to pee, so,

34:46.693 --> 34:49.560
- I've just got to...
- Oh.

34:49.562 --> 34:52.429
- All right, just watch your step.
- O-Okay.

34:54.850 --> 34:57.001
I can go to the bathroom by myself.

34:57.475 --> 34:59.737
- Yeah, I mean, sure.
- Totally.

34:59.739 --> 35:00.771
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

35:00.773 --> 35:02.473
Yeah.

35:05.535 --> 35:07.568
Okay, we can't do this.

35:08.047 --> 35:09.547
She's gonna sleep, she's
gonna go to the bathroom,

35:09.549 --> 35:11.449
she's gonna cut bagels...
We have to get used to it.

35:11.451 --> 35:13.751
(gasps) Oh, my God, I just remembered.

35:13.753 --> 35:15.353
I left toenail clippers in there.

35:15.355 --> 35:17.455
You clip your nails at my house?

35:17.457 --> 35:18.990
My toenails grow really fast,

35:18.992 --> 35:20.291
and they're super-thick
so I carry these

35:20.293 --> 35:21.759
heavy-duty nail clippers on me.

35:21.761 --> 35:23.928
Okay, okay, let's just, like, calm down.

35:23.930 --> 35:25.463
She's not, like, gonna kill herself

35:25.465 --> 35:28.432
- with your nasty, oversized clippers.
- All right.

35:28.434 --> 35:29.634
(sighs) Let's calm down.

35:29.636 --> 35:31.369
And I'm just, I'm knocking on the door

35:31.371 --> 35:33.703
and see if she's okay, that's all.

35:35.441 --> 35:36.578
Rebecca?

35:41.381 --> 35:42.980
Becca?

35:42.982 --> 35:45.650
(jiggling locked doorknob, knocking)

35:45.652 --> 35:47.251
Becky?

35:47.253 --> 35:51.255
Okay, she's not answering.

35:51.257 --> 35:54.592
- (knocking on door)
- (ear-buds): ♪ Yes, no on the crazy ♪

35:54.594 --> 35:57.461
♪ We hope this helps. ♪

35:57.735 --> 35:59.263
What?

35:59.265 --> 36:01.265
She never locks the bathroom door.

36:01.267 --> 36:02.934
Heather's right. Let's not panic.

36:02.936 --> 36:04.569
Okay, all right. (gasps)

36:04.571 --> 36:06.037
What are you doing?

36:06.039 --> 36:08.406
This is my intruder ax. I
can't just stand out here.

36:08.408 --> 36:10.007
I thought you put all
the sharp things away.

36:10.009 --> 36:11.642
I live in a famous murder house.

36:11.644 --> 36:13.077
You think I don't have an ax?

36:13.079 --> 36:14.212
Do it! Do it!

36:14.214 --> 36:16.314
- Just chop it down.
- Just chop it...

36:16.316 --> 36:19.283
(screaming)

36:20.587 --> 36:22.253
Hey, girl.

36:22.255 --> 36:24.046
How was your pee?

36:30.230 --> 36:32.683
What is going on?

36:32.708 --> 36:35.542
Okay, so we may have
been a touch worried.

36:35.544 --> 36:37.911
You didn't answer the
door when we knocked.

36:37.913 --> 36:39.146
I had ear-buds in.

36:39.488 --> 36:41.615
- Oh, ear-buds.
- Ear-buds, right.

36:41.617 --> 36:43.934
In your ears, so you couldn't...

36:43.959 --> 36:45.168
Makes total sense.

36:45.587 --> 36:47.654
I'm sorry to worry you
guys. Look, I was in there

36:47.656 --> 36:49.156
doing this thing that I sometimes do

36:49.158 --> 36:50.857
to make sense of things, I was...

36:50.859 --> 36:54.127
listening to music and
watching music videos and, yeah.

36:54.129 --> 36:56.463
Oh, yeah, cool, because we just thought

36:56.465 --> 37:00.300
- you were killing yourself.
- (sobbing)

37:01.196 --> 37:04.137
We thought you were dead.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.439
We thought we were gonna open the door,

37:06.441 --> 37:07.874
and you'd be all kinds of dead.

37:07.876 --> 37:10.377
I'm so afraid you're gonna die, Rebecca.

37:10.379 --> 37:13.046
I'm so scared. (sniffs)

37:13.048 --> 37:16.383
I have never had a
friend like you before.

37:16.706 --> 37:20.253
I... almost lost you.

37:20.255 --> 37:23.890
And I have been telling all
these people... to have hope,

37:23.892 --> 37:26.993
when, really, I am so sad and so scared,

37:26.995 --> 37:30.297
and I have to poop so, so bad.

37:30.299 --> 37:32.732
- Oh, honey.
- Oh.

37:33.041 --> 37:35.612
(Valencia sobs)

37:36.556 --> 37:38.438
Rebecca, please.

37:39.025 --> 37:42.042
Promise me you'll never do it again.

37:42.652 --> 37:45.619
I... I would lo... I would
love to promise you that.

37:46.715 --> 37:48.673
I'd love to promise you all that.

37:49.797 --> 37:51.530
But I can't.

37:53.322 --> 37:54.971
Look...

37:55.666 --> 37:57.691
The way I felt on that plane, I don't,

37:57.693 --> 37:59.471
I don't ever want to
feel like that again.

38:00.362 --> 38:04.174
And now that I know... what I have,

38:05.502 --> 38:07.834
I hope I can get the help that I need,

38:07.836 --> 38:09.936
but... the truth is,

38:09.938 --> 38:12.533
I don't know what the future holds.

38:13.619 --> 38:16.945
So I just can't promise
anything to anyone, even myself.

38:18.601 --> 38:22.226
You know, for someone who's “crazy,”

38:22.463 --> 38:24.992
you sound pretty sane.

38:26.911 --> 38:28.672
Thank you, Heather.

38:31.426 --> 38:34.027
And I'm so sorry that
I put you through this.

38:34.029 --> 38:35.295
Really.

38:35.297 --> 38:37.063
- Where is she?
- (gasps)

38:37.065 --> 38:39.499
Where's my girl? Oh, I
came as soon as I heard.

38:39.501 --> 38:42.435
She's fine, but what happened to you?

38:42.437 --> 38:45.305
WiJo and I were in a
yurt, totally off the grid,

38:45.307 --> 38:47.274
and for one second, I got cell service,

38:47.276 --> 38:48.842
and all these messages came through,

38:48.844 --> 38:51.011
and I saw what was happening with you,

38:51.013 --> 38:53.813
so I borrowed this tank top from
WiJo because it was so hot out,

38:53.815 --> 38:55.548
and then I hopped in my
car, but it wouldn't start

38:55.550 --> 38:57.050
because the battery died,

38:57.052 --> 38:58.518
so I found a guy in
one of the other yurts,

38:58.520 --> 39:01.154
and I borrowed his car,
but it was a convertible.

39:01.156 --> 39:04.024
And there was so much traffic
coming from the desert.

39:04.026 --> 39:06.927
So I just drove three hours in the sun.

39:06.929 --> 39:08.728
And I didn't stop for sunscreen.

39:08.730 --> 39:11.331
I had a hat but it fell
off after five minutes.

39:11.434 --> 39:14.200
I knew I was burning, but
I had to come see my girl.

39:14.202 --> 39:15.762
- Who needs skin?
- Oh.

39:15.787 --> 39:18.905
- Oh. No, no, no. I'm sorry.
- Sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

39:18.907 --> 39:21.341
- You've been through so much.
- No, Darryl,

39:21.343 --> 39:22.976
I want to apologize...

39:22.978 --> 39:24.411
for all the horrible
things I said to you

39:24.413 --> 39:25.679
before I left for New York.

39:25.681 --> 39:28.315
It w... they were,
they were all terrible.

39:28.317 --> 39:29.683
I want to apologize to all of you guys.

39:29.685 --> 39:31.618
You know I didn't
mean any of that stuff.

39:31.620 --> 39:34.387
I know that. We know that.

39:34.389 --> 39:36.289
- Of course we do.
- Absolutely. No question.

39:36.291 --> 39:38.291
(overlapping chatter)

39:38.293 --> 39:41.661
DARRYL: I swear to God, when I
get my hands on that Josh Chan...

39:41.663 --> 39:43.296
When I get my hands on that jerk,

39:43.298 --> 39:44.931
I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind.

39:44.933 --> 39:46.199
Because you know what?

39:46.201 --> 39:48.223
I could murder Josh right now.

39:48.248 --> 39:49.803
I do have an ax.

39:49.805 --> 39:52.105
Good. This is all his fault.

39:52.107 --> 39:53.606
REBECCA: Darryl, calm down.

39:53.608 --> 39:55.275
This is not Josh's fault.

39:56.711 --> 40:00.580
I mean, it feels weird
to even say Josh's name.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.414
I-I haven't thought about him in days.

40:03.919 --> 40:06.016
Truly. I mean, it-it's almost like...

40:06.822 --> 40:08.727
Josh is irrelevant.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.398
It's not even about Josh.

40:13.546 --> 40:15.453
Maybe it never was.

40:17.961 --> 40:20.233
Oh, Darryl, honey,
let's-let's get you in...

40:20.664 --> 40:22.135
I don't know, some sort of ice bath.

40:22.137 --> 40:23.670
DARRYL: What does it
mean when it blisters?

40:23.672 --> 40:24.971
REBECCA: Oh. Okay.

40:24.973 --> 40:26.973
No one touch him. No one touch him.

40:28.577 --> 40:30.143
So I'm here.

40:30.145 --> 40:32.645
And I'm ready to face it all.

40:32.647 --> 40:34.814
And I'm ready to start
group therapy, too.

40:34.816 --> 40:36.216
I think you'll like it.

40:36.218 --> 40:38.585
Everyone is really nice and supportive.

40:38.587 --> 40:40.253
But, like, nuts, right?

40:40.255 --> 40:42.455
(laughs) Let's go.

40:42.457 --> 40:44.024
But you didn't answer me.

40:44.026 --> 40:45.831
Are they, are they all terrible?

40:49.765 --> 40:51.865
(sighs)

40:53.828 --> 40:55.568
You were not supposed to see me.

40:55.570 --> 40:57.804
I didn't know you delivered stuff.

40:57.806 --> 40:59.172
This your side hustle?

40:59.174 --> 41:00.573
(chuckles)

41:00.575 --> 41:01.775
Oh.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.546
Oh, these are beautiful.

41:10.519 --> 41:12.085
Wow, this is really sweet.

41:12.087 --> 41:13.586
Well, I mean it.

41:14.212 --> 41:15.779
I do.

41:16.258 --> 41:17.857
I'm here for you.

41:17.859 --> 41:19.025
Thank you.

41:19.932 --> 41:21.547
That really means a lot.

41:22.964 --> 41:24.597
I got a... I should get inside.

41:24.599 --> 41:26.099
I got a workbook in therapy today,

41:26.101 --> 41:27.534
and I love workbooks, so...

41:27.536 --> 41:28.835
You like to work?

41:28.837 --> 41:30.370
That's the first I've heard of it.

41:30.372 --> 41:32.539
(laughs)

41:33.781 --> 41:35.314
Oh, wait. Um,

41:35.339 --> 41:37.534
ju... um, brought this.

41:37.559 --> 41:38.812
Oh, my God,

41:38.814 --> 41:41.047
I was wondering where
Ruth Gator Ginsburg went.

41:41.049 --> 41:42.415
Thank you.

41:42.572 --> 41:44.348
I'm, uh...

41:45.367 --> 41:46.911
I'm glad you're home.
