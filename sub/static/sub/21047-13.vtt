00:00.612 --> 00:03.179
<i>Previously on "blood drive"...</i>

00:03.181 --> 00:05.180
<i>Ain't no laws no more.</i>

00:05.182 --> 00:06.548
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

00:06.550 --> 00:08.883
<i>Everyone's in
those fracking tubes.</i>

00:08.885 --> 00:10.484
You're becoming human.

00:10.486 --> 00:11.885
You're right.

00:11.887 --> 00:14.120
They're never gonna stop, grace.

00:14.122 --> 00:16.187
Not until everything you love
is gone!

00:22.660 --> 00:24.659
I'm your friend...

00:24.661 --> 00:26.128
<i>What the fuck is happening?</i>

00:26.130 --> 00:27.294
I built a new you.

00:27.296 --> 00:28.429
This might sting a little.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.497
Give me all the mods.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

01:01.284 --> 01:04.485
Slow down. The race is over.

01:04.486 --> 01:06.353
Arthur.

01:06.355 --> 01:09.221
I'll ease up a bit.

01:09.223 --> 01:12.323
Don't bother.
The city's a graveyard.

01:12.325 --> 01:15.225
Nothing left in the streets
but gutter punk vermin

01:15.227 --> 01:16.692
and drug addicts
with blood so toxic,

01:16.694 --> 01:20.228
not even heart would put them
into the fracking tubes.

01:20.230 --> 01:21.529
Nah, you go right ahead.

01:21.531 --> 01:22.530
Grind 'em up.

01:22.532 --> 01:24.564
You'd be doing them a favor.

01:29.202 --> 01:30.434
Is that their end game?

01:30.436 --> 01:32.602
Put the whole world
in fracking tubes?

01:32.604 --> 01:34.237
They're powerful enough
to destroy

01:34.239 --> 01:35.905
two of the greatest cities
on the planet.

01:35.907 --> 01:37.506
What makes you think
they're gonna stop

01:37.508 --> 01:38.773
at la and New York?

01:41.209 --> 01:44.443
The source of all hardtech power

01:44.445 --> 01:46.178
beyond our comprehension,

01:46.180 --> 01:48.946
and that whole building's
one quasisentient

01:48.948 --> 01:51.714
interdimensional
death labyrinth.

01:51.716 --> 01:53.616
They'll know
we're there to hurt it.

01:53.618 --> 01:55.417
I'm not gonna hurt it.

01:55.419 --> 01:58.252
I'm gonna kill it.

01:58.254 --> 01:59.420
Ooh!

01:59.422 --> 02:01.655
Slinky like
the new primo Arthur.

02:01.657 --> 02:02.655
You know why I'm glad?

02:02.657 --> 02:05.190
Little bit of fan fiction.

02:05.192 --> 02:06.524
Starring you and I.

02:06.526 --> 02:07.758
Very steamy.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.493
I don't know
why you find this so funny.

02:10.495 --> 02:13.261
There's a 99% chance
we're gonna die tonight.

02:13.263 --> 02:16.263
<i>For you? 99.9.</i>

02:16.265 --> 02:17.498
<i>We are careening</i>

02:17.500 --> 02:19.566
towards the greatest
corporate power

02:19.568 --> 02:21.300
on the face of the earth.

02:21.302 --> 02:22.734
Cut off the head of the snake...

02:22.736 --> 02:24.569
and the rest of the snake dies
with it.

02:24.571 --> 02:28.371
Yes, but...
This is no mayhem party.

02:28.373 --> 02:30.706
And there'll be
a thousand employees

02:30.708 --> 02:34.676
there tonight whose only job
will be to stop us.

03:09.432 --> 03:11.599
Heart enterprises. Please hold.

03:11.601 --> 03:13.700
Heart enterprises. Please hold.

03:13.702 --> 03:16.001
Heart enterprises. Please hold.

03:16.003 --> 03:18.237
Heart enterprises. Please hold.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.438
Heart enterprises. Please hold.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.572
Well, that was anticlimactic.

03:22.574 --> 03:24.406
Heart enterprises. Please hold.

03:24.408 --> 03:26.408
<i>Heart enterprises. Please hold.</i>

03:37.016 --> 03:39.450
Heart enterprises. Please hold.

03:39.452 --> 03:41.618
Heart enterprises. Please hold.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.719
Heart enterprises. Please hold.

03:43.721 --> 03:45.587
The hell happened here?

03:45.589 --> 03:47.021
Heart enterprises. Please hold.

03:47.023 --> 03:48.489
Maybe somebody beat us to it?

03:48.491 --> 03:50.690
Looks like
they were all trying to escape.

03:50.692 --> 03:52.458
From what?

03:54.327 --> 03:56.461
Heart enterprises...

03:56.463 --> 04:00.496
Heart enterprises, please <i> die!</i>

04:03.400 --> 04:06.734
She never validated my parking.

04:06.736 --> 04:09.402
You know every scumbag
in this world.

04:09.404 --> 04:10.836
Who did this?

04:10.838 --> 04:15.606
Definitely the work
of a singular, deranged mind.

04:15.608 --> 04:18.440
Very little blood. Classy.

04:18.442 --> 04:20.442
This way.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.853
What the fuck is going on?

04:36.855 --> 04:38.787
A security measure!

04:38.789 --> 04:42.423
Heart architecture is like
a time warp continuum.

04:42.425 --> 04:44.491
Kind of like m. C. Escher
on acid.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.292
If you'd listen
to my monologues more,

04:46.294 --> 04:47.760
you wouldn't be so confused.

04:47.762 --> 04:49.494
How can we be
in both places at once?

04:49.496 --> 04:52.296
Exactly! Shall we?

05:04.772 --> 05:05.837
This is too weird.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.506
No way I trust him.

05:07.508 --> 05:08.806
Agreed.

05:25.786 --> 05:28.452
Step lightly. Stick to the path.

05:28.454 --> 05:29.653
Otherwise,
you'll get lost in here forever.

05:29.655 --> 05:31.621
No! No, not that way!

05:34.358 --> 05:36.624
Now we have to start
all over again

05:36.626 --> 05:38.091
from the beginning!

05:38.093 --> 05:41.627
Slink? Where'd everyone go?

05:41.629 --> 05:43.761
Gone.

05:43.763 --> 05:45.797
Purged.

05:45.799 --> 05:47.364
Flushed out.

05:47.366 --> 05:49.098
Or, to put it
in blood drive parlance,

05:49.100 --> 05:50.733
the building took a shit.

05:50.735 --> 05:52.100
Well, let's quit dicking around

05:52.102 --> 05:53.568
and blow this place
before we disappear too.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.836
<i>There it is.</i>

05:55.838 --> 05:57.870
<i>You want to make the building
go boom.</i>

05:57.872 --> 05:59.838
<i>I was wondering what the hell
you guys were doing.</i>

05:59.840 --> 06:01.840
- Karma?
<i>- Hey, sis.</i>

06:01.842 --> 06:03.741
<i>Did you guys like what I did
with all the pussies</i>

06:03.743 --> 06:04.775
<i>who worked here?</i>

06:04.777 --> 06:06.743
<i>They were trying to leave.</i>

06:06.745 --> 06:10.479
<i>Can you believe that?
Where's the corporate loyalty?</i>

06:10.481 --> 06:12.747
<i>Little something
from the heart lab.</i>

06:12.749 --> 06:13.814
<i>Can't wait to show you what else</i>

06:13.816 --> 06:15.382
<i>we've been developing.</i>

06:15.384 --> 06:17.383
Karma, stop it right now.

06:17.385 --> 06:19.551
Just come out. We can talk.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.553
Is anybody else wondering
how this is possible?

06:21.555 --> 06:23.921
'Cause I saw her go in
a blood engine with my own eyes.

06:23.923 --> 06:25.722
Surprise!

06:25.724 --> 06:27.356
The blood engines,

06:27.358 --> 06:28.824
they're prototype
soul reclamators.

06:28.826 --> 06:30.458
But without a soul,

06:30.460 --> 06:33.827
she would've spun
right through the vortex

06:33.829 --> 06:37.429
and landed right back here
without a scratch.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.530
<i>I underestimated your assistant.</i>

06:39.532 --> 06:42.132
Here I thought I was finally
done with her fuckery.

06:42.134 --> 06:46.434
Now! Follow closely this time.

06:48.872 --> 06:50.838
She's the head of the snake.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.706
- She's still my sister.
- Not anymore.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.574
If Karma's in charge,
all the more reason

06:55.576 --> 06:56.675
to bring this building down.

06:56.677 --> 06:57.942
<i>You know I can hear</i>

06:57.944 --> 07:00.577
<i>everything you're saying, right?</i>

07:00.579 --> 07:02.678
She was so innocent.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.847
Tell that
to all the people she killed.

07:04.849 --> 07:06.714
Hello? Hi.

07:06.716 --> 07:08.682
Remember me? We need to go.

07:08.684 --> 07:11.584
What if I had given up on you
when you went homicidal?

07:11.586 --> 07:14.519
<i>Barbie? Hey, is it okay
if I call you Barbie?</i>

07:14.521 --> 07:16.620
I really hope you're not getting
too attached to her.

07:16.622 --> 07:19.856
Grace likes to get rid of things
when she's done using them.

07:19.858 --> 07:22.557
- Fuck off!
- Ooh!

07:22.559 --> 07:23.925
She sounds upset.

07:23.927 --> 07:25.593
You know, when I died,

07:25.595 --> 07:26.961
I wasn't such a fucking brat
about it.

07:26.963 --> 07:29.529
Now, let's go!

07:32.866 --> 07:36.433
Let's not let her
get under our skin.

07:47.508 --> 07:48.808
<i>So, guys...</i>

07:48.810 --> 07:50.742
What's the plan
after the big climax?

07:50.744 --> 07:52.476
A nice epilogue scene?

07:52.478 --> 07:54.478
<i>Maybe start a new adventure
together?</i>

07:54.480 --> 07:56.579
I'll settle for gettin' you
to shut up.

07:56.581 --> 07:59.615
Ooh. So angry all the time.

07:59.617 --> 08:01.182
I bet grace likes that.

08:01.184 --> 08:03.617
She loves dangerous guys.

08:03.619 --> 08:04.818
<i>And a few girls.</i>

08:04.820 --> 08:06.619
Guys, girls... doesn't matter.

08:06.621 --> 08:07.820
None were me.

08:07.822 --> 08:09.454
I don't care
if this is the corporate

08:09.456 --> 08:10.755
headquarters of hell.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.456
We're gonna bring
this building down,

08:12.458 --> 08:14.624
and there's nothing you can do
to stop us.

08:14.626 --> 08:18.427
Wanna bet, bitches?

08:18.429 --> 08:20.728
Christopher,
why did you ask for this?

08:20.730 --> 08:23.630
These modifications
are dangerous.

08:23.632 --> 08:25.831
Please talk to me.

08:29.169 --> 08:30.967
Don't leave me here alone.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.570
Yes.

08:34.572 --> 08:36.504
Come back.

08:36.506 --> 08:38.639
Whwhat have they done to you?

08:38.640 --> 08:41.674
I'm so sorry.

08:41.676 --> 08:43.775
We have to leave
this horrible place

08:43.777 --> 08:45.644
and never come back.

08:45.646 --> 08:49.913
I can't stand thinking
what I did to you in here.

08:52.216 --> 08:55.683
If we're going outside,
we're gonna need supplies.

08:56.685 --> 08:59.453
Every city's in chaos now.

09:10.928 --> 09:13.462
I'll be back.

09:30.806 --> 09:32.807
Where did you go?

09:32.809 --> 09:34.875
One thing about heart,
they're cheap bastards.

09:34.877 --> 09:37.543
These stairs are only used
by the aki units.

09:37.545 --> 09:39.744
There's no cameras
or microphones.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.046
Should have cost 3 million.

09:41.047 --> 09:45.248
Instead, they only spent 1.4.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.748
Don't want to waste
expensive tech

09:46.750 --> 09:48.484
on their slave labor.

09:48.486 --> 09:50.551
Bright side is,
Karma can't see or hear us.

09:50.553 --> 09:51.886
How do you know for sure?

09:51.888 --> 09:53.820
Well, ii used to be a janitor

09:53.822 --> 09:55.955
here for a short while...
It's amazing what you'll find

09:55.957 --> 09:57.689
in executives' garbage.

09:57.691 --> 09:59.023
For instance, the central beam

09:59.025 --> 10:01.625
that holds this whole place
together...

10:01.627 --> 10:03.259
That comes down,
the whole building

10:03.261 --> 10:04.927
comes down with it.

10:04.929 --> 10:06.795
How do I find Karma?

10:06.797 --> 10:08.729
Well, she used to haunt
the boardroom on the top floor.

10:08.731 --> 10:10.731
And where's the central beam?

10:10.733 --> 10:12.966
In the basement.

10:12.968 --> 10:15.567
She'd kill you
without thinking twice.

10:15.569 --> 10:17.568
Doesn't mean
I have to do the same.

10:17.570 --> 10:19.503
Ticktock. Ticktock. Ticktock.

10:19.505 --> 10:20.971
We came all this way
and made a plan.

10:20.973 --> 10:23.672
You want to throw all that away?

10:23.674 --> 10:24.939
I'll help.

10:25.975 --> 10:27.641
I want to save her.

10:27.643 --> 10:29.810
No, no, no, no, no, nono, no...

10:29.812 --> 10:32.044
shut the fuck up, slink!

10:34.614 --> 10:36.714
Okay.

10:36.716 --> 10:39.048
Better get going.

10:39.050 --> 10:40.950
Boy, she gives you anal
on the first date,

10:40.952 --> 10:44.719
and now she's got you wrapped
around her little finger.

10:47.088 --> 10:48.588
Watch your mouth,

10:48.590 --> 10:50.890
or we'll be meeting
your next clone.

11:07.735 --> 11:12.870
You want to play... Primo? Fine.

11:12.872 --> 11:18.107
If we're not on the same side,
let's... see who wins.

11:19.743 --> 11:22.076
How does 30 minutes sound?

11:25.312 --> 11:28.013
Heart will be destroyed...

11:28.015 --> 11:31.649
Whether you're in this building
or not.

11:31.651 --> 11:33.850
Ready? Set? Go!

11:39.589 --> 11:40.888
What's wrong?

11:40.890 --> 11:43.023
When our parents died,

11:43.025 --> 11:45.024
I tried my best.

11:45.026 --> 11:47.926
I didn't ever want
to raise Karma.

11:49.594 --> 11:51.161
Guess she saw through
the bullshit.

11:53.897 --> 11:55.664
Despite
everything that's happened,

11:55.666 --> 11:57.631
I know how much you love Karma.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.900
Yeah, and somehow,
I'm still the reason

11:59.902 --> 12:01.734
we're all in this mess.

12:01.736 --> 12:02.969
You're not responsible.

12:02.971 --> 12:04.002
You didn't create heart.

12:04.004 --> 12:05.671
I'm not talking about heart.

12:05.673 --> 12:07.672
I'm talking about myself.
What if she was right?

12:07.674 --> 12:09.105
What if everything she said
was true,

12:09.107 --> 12:12.808
and what if I can't care
about anybody other than myself?

12:12.810 --> 12:14.943
What?
You're not gonna say anything?

12:14.945 --> 12:16.611
I don't care.

12:16.613 --> 12:18.145
What is that supposed to mean?

12:18.147 --> 12:20.880
Even if Karma was right,
which she wasn't,

12:20.882 --> 12:23.048
I don't care.

12:23.050 --> 12:26.650
You saw something in me
I couldn't see in myself.

12:26.652 --> 12:29.052
I want to do you
the same courtesy.

12:29.054 --> 12:30.119
Thanks.

12:30.121 --> 12:31.920
You're welcome.

12:33.889 --> 12:36.923
Now, let's go save your sister
and get the hell out of here.

12:36.925 --> 12:38.924
I give them fame, fortune,

12:38.926 --> 12:40.726
make them look sexy...
What do I get?

12:40.728 --> 12:44.795
Aggravation.
How utterly ungrateful.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.929
Help!

12:46.931 --> 12:49.798
Someone, please.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.366
I'm hurt bad!

12:52.368 --> 12:55.134
She went crazy, man.
She broke into our lab.

12:55.136 --> 12:57.337
Shshe took everything.

12:57.339 --> 12:59.371
Stuff
wewe haven't even tested yet.

12:59.373 --> 13:02.373
Who? Karma?

13:02.375 --> 13:04.874
She didn't leave any aki units

13:04.876 --> 13:06.175
running around down here,
did she?

13:06.177 --> 13:09.077
They can be... quite pesky.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.845
No, no,
sheshe shut everything down,

13:10.847 --> 13:12.679
allall the programs.

13:12.681 --> 13:13.914
What do you mean?

13:13.916 --> 13:15.781
What do you mean,
all the programs?

13:15.783 --> 13:17.816
Even the Antigua research lab?

13:17.818 --> 13:19.617
That's classified.

13:19.619 --> 13:21.118
But you have access?

13:21.120 --> 13:23.953
Get me access to that room,
and I swear I will avenge you.

13:23.955 --> 13:26.888
I'll make her pay
for all that she's done:

13:26.890 --> 13:29.390
Destroying the labs,
for killing all the employees,

13:29.392 --> 13:31.091
for cutting you in half.

13:31.093 --> 13:32.392
She cut me in half?

13:32.394 --> 13:34.827
Jesus! Fuck! My legs!

13:34.829 --> 13:36.961
My legs!

13:36.963 --> 13:38.363
My fucking legs!

13:38.365 --> 13:40.697
Jesus!

13:40.699 --> 13:42.031
Call me an ambulance?

13:42.033 --> 13:43.033
Hello?

14:01.111 --> 14:04.178
As soon as we open this door,
we're back on the grid.

14:04.180 --> 14:05.713
She'll know we're here

14:05.715 --> 14:07.214
and probably doesn't want
to be saved.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.887
I guess slink was wrong
about something for once.

14:18.722 --> 14:20.055
Bye, Barbie.

14:22.991 --> 14:24.825
Arthur!

14:24.827 --> 14:27.727
Good. Now we can finally talk
in private.

14:38.834 --> 14:41.202
What are you doing?

14:41.204 --> 14:43.270
Dad's gonna kill you.

14:45.205 --> 14:46.706
Dad already tried.

14:52.377 --> 14:54.411
Wait. Please don't go.

14:54.413 --> 14:56.245
Look, kid, I just need
to blow off some steam, okay?

14:56.247 --> 14:58.780
I'll be back.

14:58.782 --> 15:00.415
What if he wakes up?

15:00.417 --> 15:02.182
After ten beers?

15:26.899 --> 15:28.799
Any tswift in here?

15:28.801 --> 15:30.700
Who?

15:33.804 --> 15:37.304
This... is music.

15:49.847 --> 15:51.480
Can I take a turn?

15:51.482 --> 15:53.281
Smoking? No way.

15:53.283 --> 15:55.916
Gross. No. Driving.

15:55.918 --> 15:58.117
Even worse!

15:58.119 --> 16:00.419
Please?

16:00.421 --> 16:03.487
The car's named after me.

16:03.489 --> 16:06.856
Karma,
the car was here before you.

16:06.858 --> 16:08.491
Think about it.

16:08.493 --> 16:10.792
This feels good.

16:10.794 --> 16:13.494
It feels like freedom.

16:13.496 --> 16:15.495
I wonder what dad would do
if we never came back.

16:27.739 --> 16:29.471
Hey!

16:29.473 --> 16:31.405
That was my last one.

16:54.489 --> 16:56.387
Are you fucking kidding me?

17:02.392 --> 17:04.526
I don't believe it.

17:05.895 --> 17:10.797
Grace d'argento
is actually in love.

17:10.799 --> 17:13.531
He must have a magical dick.

17:18.169 --> 17:21.337
A blood engine couldn't kill me.

17:21.339 --> 17:23.505
What makes you think
this thing would?

17:23.507 --> 17:25.873
I really don't give a shit
what you think anymore.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.508
So what's the plan, Gracie?

17:27.510 --> 17:29.876
You gonna kill me? Again?

17:29.878 --> 17:31.243
Or let me guess.

17:31.245 --> 17:32.477
Try to reform me.

17:32.479 --> 17:34.545
You want me to change my mind.

17:34.547 --> 17:36.412
Be a good person.

17:36.414 --> 17:38.414
But you bring nothing else
to the table.

17:38.416 --> 17:40.482
At least
this company sees my value.

17:40.484 --> 17:44.851
You destroyed
everything I ever loved.

17:44.853 --> 17:48.154
Including yourself.

17:48.156 --> 17:50.355
I guess it's Karma.

17:53.826 --> 17:57.860
Yeah. Well.

18:01.530 --> 18:03.830
Karma's a bitch.

18:05.466 --> 18:08.467
Son of a bitch.

18:20.875 --> 18:23.209
Arthur...

18:23.211 --> 18:24.844
Arthur!

18:29.916 --> 18:31.815
Arthur?

18:33.184 --> 18:34.449
Hello?

19:03.469 --> 19:05.336
<i>Hey, Julian!</i>

19:05.338 --> 19:07.037
<i>How's it going, buddy?</i>

19:07.039 --> 19:09.005
Sort of burned up
all your clones.

19:09.007 --> 19:11.373
Sorry about that. Had to do it.

19:11.375 --> 19:12.607
You might be the only thing

19:12.609 --> 19:14.409
that could really threaten
the company.

19:14.411 --> 19:16.476
And yet, here I am.

19:16.478 --> 19:18.611
<i>Yes... and no.</i>

19:18.613 --> 19:21.279
<i>You are the last of your kind.</i>

19:21.281 --> 19:24.248
<i>There will never be
another one, ever.</i>

19:24.250 --> 19:26.249
<i>I made sure of it.</i>

19:26.251 --> 19:27.884
<i>You know, it wasn't easy
figuring out</i>

19:27.886 --> 19:29.284
<i>what would hurt you,</i>

19:29.286 --> 19:31.285
<i>but then it hit me:</i>

19:31.287 --> 19:34.855
<i>You've never been afraid to die.</i>

19:34.857 --> 19:37.489
So... here's the news.

19:37.491 --> 19:39.490
You can either bring down
the central beam

19:39.492 --> 19:41.426
and destroy the building,

19:41.428 --> 19:44.027
but you'll kill yourself
in the process...

19:44.029 --> 19:45.995
<i>Really</i> kill yourself...

19:45.997 --> 19:48.630
<i>Or you can just walk out
the front door</i>

19:48.632 --> 19:50.965
<i>without getting your revenge.</i>

19:50.967 --> 19:52.499
But you can't do both.

19:52.501 --> 19:54.367
You have to choose.

19:54.369 --> 19:58.536
To be or not to be...
That is the question.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.484
We have to move fast.
They're gonna blow us up.

20:39.063 --> 20:41.063
No.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.899
I'm sorry.

20:43.901 --> 20:46.333
The rainbows, I...

20:46.335 --> 20:49.969
Right.

20:49.971 --> 20:52.271
Hey, um...

20:52.273 --> 20:56.006
You happen to see a...
A guy come by here?

20:56.008 --> 20:58.341
He wears a top hat. Deep voice.

20:58.343 --> 21:00.376
Kind of looks like a magician.

21:00.378 --> 21:03.678
The walls are alive.

21:03.680 --> 21:07.613
All of the whispers,
theythey see 'em moving.

21:07.615 --> 21:09.981
Sure they are.

21:09.983 --> 21:11.616
Yeah, sure they are.

21:12.918 --> 21:16.419
I have to find this guy.

21:16.421 --> 21:19.121
I have to stop him
from blowing the central beam,

21:19.123 --> 21:21.489
or he'll kill grace.

21:24.592 --> 21:26.558
That way?

21:26.560 --> 21:29.994
That way? Okay.
Thanks, I owe you one, buddy.

21:29.996 --> 21:32.029
Hey, I'll get somebody back here
asap for you.

21:32.031 --> 21:33.630
You're gonnayou're gonna
be fine!

21:44.339 --> 21:46.471
Shit.

21:58.948 --> 22:00.681
Christopher!

22:00.683 --> 22:02.648
You're...

22:07.085 --> 22:10.119
Hey... partner.

22:21.462 --> 22:23.294
Yo, man.

22:23.296 --> 22:24.529
Yo!

22:26.297 --> 22:27.297
Where's your lady?

22:27.299 --> 22:29.165
Thought we were doubledating.

22:29.167 --> 22:31.466
She's not coming.
Said she wasn't feeling well.

22:31.468 --> 22:33.234
The three of us
can still eat, though.

22:33.236 --> 22:35.536
Unless... no, I'd be...
I don't want to...

22:35.538 --> 22:37.270
just hold on. Just hold on.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.205
No, no, no.

22:39.207 --> 22:41.273
Just hold on.

22:41.275 --> 22:42.640
I'm sorry, babe.

22:42.642 --> 22:44.308
Can we meet back at your place?

22:44.310 --> 22:46.543
Who says you're even
coming back to my place?

22:48.679 --> 22:50.511
Okay. Your call.

22:50.513 --> 22:53.547
Don't be too long.

23:01.254 --> 23:03.187
You didn't have to do that.

23:03.189 --> 23:05.621
- Where is she for real?
- She left.

23:05.623 --> 23:08.557
Said she doesn't want
to marry a cop.

23:08.559 --> 23:10.458
Forget her.

23:10.460 --> 23:13.293
If she don't see the real you,

23:13.295 --> 23:15.694
you don't want her.

23:15.696 --> 23:17.396
Still sucks, though.

23:17.398 --> 23:19.297
Of course it does.

23:19.299 --> 23:21.999
But as my grandmama used to say,

23:22.001 --> 23:26.167
women are like buses...
Always another one to ride.

23:26.169 --> 23:29.303
Didn't know
your grandmama was a feminist.

23:30.339 --> 23:32.005
Pentecostal feminist.

23:32.007 --> 23:34.506
Used to beat my ass
to kirk Franklin.

23:36.309 --> 23:37.641
Let's get drunk.

23:39.578 --> 23:41.411
What about your girl?

23:43.781 --> 23:45.246
I'd rather hang with you.

23:50.585 --> 23:52.618
Ain't that a motherfucker?

23:52.620 --> 23:55.620
Me being all tech and awesome?

23:58.256 --> 24:00.289
And you still being a skin sack?

24:00.291 --> 24:01.357
Christopher.

24:01.359 --> 24:02.758
You're making a mistake.

24:02.760 --> 24:05.259
My only mistake
was being your partner.

24:05.261 --> 24:07.193
You haven't even asked
why I'm kicking your ass.

24:12.531 --> 24:14.465
You're not kicking my ass.

24:14.467 --> 24:16.733
'Cause there's no iron
in your bones.

24:16.735 --> 24:18.334
Guilt makes you weak.

24:20.204 --> 24:21.236
Okay.

24:21.238 --> 24:22.604
I've been looking for you.

24:22.606 --> 24:24.805
I've been trying
to shut this company down.

24:30.778 --> 24:32.743
I watched you kill me.

24:32.745 --> 24:34.677
Repeatedly.

24:37.648 --> 24:38.781
It wasn't you.

24:38.783 --> 24:40.648
It was a robot, obviously.

24:42.385 --> 24:44.718
You didn't know that
at the time.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.824
Or die.

25:19.641 --> 25:22.442
Good evening!

25:26.344 --> 25:27.611
Gentlemen, I'm Julian slink.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.512
So pleased
to make your acquaintance.

25:29.514 --> 25:30.847
Before we can proceed
any further,

25:30.849 --> 25:33.082
I shall require
the proper dress:

25:33.084 --> 25:35.349
Not quite steampunk,
but not quite retro;

25:35.351 --> 25:37.584
Homemade colors,
preferably not from nature;

25:37.586 --> 25:39.586
Boots made from calf skin;

25:39.588 --> 25:41.587
Underwear, sometimes;

25:41.589 --> 25:43.822
Shirts from persia,
silk or panda wool;

25:43.824 --> 25:46.790
And finally,
something dramatic on top,

25:46.792 --> 25:49.759
some flair, a bowler...
No, no! A top hat.

25:49.761 --> 25:55.296
Yes, a top hat.

25:55.298 --> 25:56.663
Perfect.

25:56.665 --> 25:58.598
He talks too much.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.532
That's the third nurse
they killed this week.

26:00.534 --> 26:02.633
Why do they want 3,000 of 'em?

26:02.635 --> 26:04.335
Should've focused on my design.

26:04.337 --> 26:06.570
It's much better.
Robotic. Obedient.

26:06.572 --> 26:08.737
I thought
you were two weeks behind.

26:08.739 --> 26:09.871
Managed to merge the code.

26:09.873 --> 26:11.506
Had to leave a little bio
inside,

26:11.508 --> 26:12.806
but not worried about it.

26:12.808 --> 26:14.408
That's dangerous.

26:14.410 --> 26:15.675
Sheshe manages to access
that code,

26:15.677 --> 26:16.876
she could unlock her humanity.

26:16.878 --> 26:19.111
Never gonna happen.

26:19.113 --> 26:21.412
Not unless she figures out
how to have an orgasm.

26:27.685 --> 26:29.784
To die, to sleep.

26:29.786 --> 26:31.552
To sleep, perchance to dream.

26:31.554 --> 26:34.820
Ay, but there's the rub;

26:34.822 --> 26:38.590
For in that sleep of death,
what dreams may come

26:38.592 --> 26:41.892
when we've shuffled off
this mortal coil.

26:41.894 --> 26:43.893
I never understood that.

26:44.828 --> 26:46.361
Until now.

26:47.897 --> 26:51.698
I thought all the aki units
had been shut down.

26:51.700 --> 26:55.400
I'm not an aki unit anymore.

26:55.402 --> 26:57.401
I'm just aki.

26:58.604 --> 27:00.704
I am.

27:00.706 --> 27:04.173
Consciousness.

27:05.608 --> 27:09.643
Humanity.
How unfortunate for you.

27:15.780 --> 27:18.848
You've lived, haven't you?

27:18.850 --> 27:22.851
I have lived thousands
of lives, my dear.

27:22.853 --> 27:24.819
Then you know.

27:25.787 --> 27:27.454
Know what?

27:27.456 --> 27:30.389
Why I have to do this.

27:33.593 --> 27:35.726
Fucking hell.

27:35.728 --> 27:38.361
Guess I'm not fully human yet.

27:38.363 --> 27:40.662
I still have some strength left.

27:40.664 --> 27:44.532
I can't let you
bring down the building, Julian.

27:44.534 --> 27:46.399
You'll kill Christopher.

27:46.401 --> 27:48.367
Where's your compassion?

27:48.369 --> 27:49.468
Please.

27:49.470 --> 27:50.569
Just because you're human

27:50.571 --> 27:52.503
doesn't mean you're good.

27:52.505 --> 27:54.638
That's not true.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.906
I have real feelings now.

27:56.908 --> 27:57.908
I'm a person.

28:00.510 --> 28:01.909
Big deal.

28:01.911 --> 28:03.844
You got tingles
in all your dangly bits

28:03.846 --> 28:05.545
and a knot in your stomach

28:05.547 --> 28:07.879
from all the terrible things
you've done to him.

28:07.881 --> 28:10.447
But that's not empathy.
That's guilt.

28:10.449 --> 28:12.483
It's a waste of your time.

28:16.453 --> 28:18.486
Tell me where Christopher went.

28:18.488 --> 28:21.521
I don't have access
to the security cameras anymore.

28:21.523 --> 28:24.757
I can't.

28:24.759 --> 28:28.393
Then what use are you to me?

28:36.767 --> 28:38.732
You tamper with those bombs,
I'll override the timer.

28:38.734 --> 28:40.567
We can all go,
right here, right now,

28:40.569 --> 28:42.202
including
your precious Christopher.

28:43.804 --> 28:45.437
You better go find him.

28:45.439 --> 28:48.206
You only have
a few minutes left.

28:48.208 --> 28:51.240
I've just severed
your spinal cord.

28:57.613 --> 28:59.745
You're going to die
in this building,

28:59.747 --> 29:01.781
Julian slink.

29:17.659 --> 29:19.825
You left me to rot
in this place.

29:19.827 --> 29:21.526
But look at me now.

29:21.528 --> 29:22.527
What do you mean, this place?

29:22.529 --> 29:24.428
I thought you were back in la.

29:26.664 --> 29:28.798
This basement is infinite.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.999
Can you wrap that turd
you call a brain around that?

29:32.001 --> 29:36.569
It's connected to every single
heart building in the world.

29:36.571 --> 29:39.404
You can't imagine
the power of this place.

29:39.406 --> 29:41.472
Yes, I can.

30:03.989 --> 30:05.887
Wait, wait. Wait.

30:05.889 --> 30:08.256
Timeout. Timeout.

30:14.729 --> 30:16.661
What happened to your dick?

30:18.529 --> 30:19.730
Fuck!

30:26.003 --> 30:27.568
You let her
make you more awesome,

30:27.570 --> 30:29.669
but it cost you your dick.

30:29.671 --> 30:32.571
What's the point of being
awesome if you can't screw?

30:32.573 --> 30:34.640
Maybe you're not
the real Christopher after all.

30:34.642 --> 30:36.641
Maybe I did kill you.

30:36.643 --> 30:37.874
Maybe you're
the shitty piece of hardware

30:37.876 --> 30:40.876
they used to replace you!

30:40.878 --> 30:43.544
You're such a goddamn pussy.

30:43.546 --> 30:44.846
All those years
I wasted listening

30:44.848 --> 30:47.614
to your dogood bullshit
were a waste of time.

30:47.616 --> 30:48.948
It was all an act.

30:48.950 --> 30:50.716
You weren't a good guy.

30:50.718 --> 30:53.652
You were just a coward.

30:55.787 --> 30:58.554
Gonna write about it
in your fuckin' book?

30:59.857 --> 31:01.523
Whine about it
like a little bitch.

31:02.791 --> 31:04.825
I trusted you.

31:04.827 --> 31:06.593
I looked up to you.

31:06.595 --> 31:08.560
And now I'm gonna kill you.

31:09.829 --> 31:12.730
I got a better idea, John deere.

31:12.732 --> 31:15.831
Say hi to the fuckin' primo.

31:22.638 --> 31:24.604
Primo fights like a girl.

31:28.841 --> 31:30.675
Was that supposed to hurt me?

31:30.677 --> 31:33.076
No. But this will.

31:46.586 --> 31:48.552
I thought you were dead.

31:48.554 --> 31:51.055
Seems to happen a lot
around here.

31:52.623 --> 31:54.523
Do you want to take a minute?

31:56.025 --> 31:57.491
We don't have a minute.

31:57.493 --> 32:00.827
You sure? He was your partner.

32:00.829 --> 32:05.063
That thing wasn't Christopher.

32:05.065 --> 32:07.465
Not anymore.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.333
Let's go.

32:09.335 --> 32:12.702
Better go find slink
and stop the countdown.

32:22.343 --> 32:23.575
How do I turn this off?

32:23.577 --> 32:25.009
Can't.

32:25.011 --> 32:27.477
It's called "failsafe"
for a reason.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.611
No takebacks. No second chances.

32:29.613 --> 32:31.513
Then how do we get out of here?

32:37.085 --> 32:39.618
<i>Wish I could be there
for the big boom!</i>

32:39.620 --> 32:42.654
Karma d'argento,
open this door right now!

32:42.656 --> 32:45.756
<i>Sorry, sis.
It's the end of the road.</i>

32:45.758 --> 32:48.458
If you're in this building,
you die too.

32:48.460 --> 32:49.691
<i>I've got
a get out of jail free card</i>

32:49.693 --> 32:50.792
<i>called the blood gate.</i>

32:50.794 --> 32:52.660
<i>See you on the other side.</i>

32:52.662 --> 32:53.661
<i>Not!</i>

32:53.663 --> 32:55.762
Karma! Wait.

32:55.764 --> 32:57.496
<i>Whaaat?</i>

32:57.498 --> 32:59.064
Youyou remember
that guy you liked?

32:59.066 --> 33:00.465
Lucas?

33:01.633 --> 33:03.600
He asked for my number.

33:03.602 --> 33:05.434
<i>Go to hell, you fucking bi...</i>

33:07.504 --> 33:10.804
It's a sliding door, Arthur.

33:10.806 --> 33:13.639
You got any better ideas?

33:24.482 --> 33:26.515
So I guess this is it.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.155
No lollipop?

33:39.391 --> 33:42.425
Death calls for
something stronger.

34:05.874 --> 34:06.874
Wait, fuck this.

34:11.677 --> 34:13.543
Heart took
every happy thing we ever had.

34:13.545 --> 34:16.446
I'm not letting him take
what's left.

34:17.616 --> 34:19.648
What are you doing?

34:23.820 --> 34:25.819
It needs a charge to detonate,
you know.

34:25.821 --> 34:27.686
I know.

34:27.688 --> 34:30.554
Little trick
the scholar taught me.

34:35.860 --> 34:38.427
Whatever you do...

34:39.429 --> 34:40.828
Don't come near me.

34:41.897 --> 34:43.097
Arthur, no!

34:51.469 --> 34:54.870
Holy shit. You did it.

34:54.871 --> 34:56.438
It worked.

35:02.543 --> 35:06.578
What's... wrong?

35:08.580 --> 35:10.181
Twenty seconds left.

35:11.749 --> 35:12.816
Grace.

35:12.818 --> 35:14.716
Probably won't believe me,

35:14.718 --> 35:17.485
but I never wanted this
to end a tragedy.

35:17.487 --> 35:19.186
I was actually hoping

35:19.188 --> 35:22.121
that you two might just make it
in the end.

35:22.123 --> 35:24.889
<i>Ten. Nine.</i>

35:24.891 --> 35:28.525
<i>Eight. Seven.</i>

35:28.527 --> 35:31.761
<i>Six. Five.</i>

35:31.763 --> 35:34.796
<i>Four. Three.</i>

35:34.798 --> 35:37.832
<i>Two. One.</i>

35:39.166 --> 35:41.467
Guys?

35:41.469 --> 35:43.501
Hey, guys?

35:43.503 --> 35:45.636
My bad.

35:46.871 --> 35:48.472
- You asshole!
- Yeah, actually...

35:48.474 --> 35:51.739
I need to hit this little button
right here.

35:51.741 --> 35:53.741
Oops!

35:55.144 --> 35:56.710
- You asshole.
- Asshole!

35:56.712 --> 35:58.544
Please. Just because
I'm rooting for you two

35:58.546 --> 36:01.480
doesn't mean
I have to suck all the tension

36:01.482 --> 36:02.980
out of the ending.

36:02.982 --> 36:04.682
There's a pipe.

36:04.684 --> 36:06.749
Green stripes every 30 feet.

36:06.751 --> 36:09.618
Follow it.
It'll be the fastest way out.

36:09.620 --> 36:11.719
Arthur.

36:11.721 --> 36:13.020
What?

36:14.222 --> 36:15.755
All those...

36:15.757 --> 36:19.491
People I killed...

36:19.493 --> 36:22.759
This is what they felt like?

36:22.761 --> 36:24.660
Yes.

36:32.234 --> 36:37.636
My.

36:37.638 --> 36:41.705
I wish I had my hat.

37:41.277 --> 37:43.011
Okay. Let me see.

37:43.013 --> 37:45.012
Let me look at it. God.

37:45.014 --> 37:46.712
- Stay with me.
- Almost.

37:48.181 --> 37:49.948
You're gonna be fine.

37:49.950 --> 37:51.016
It's not that bad.

37:51.018 --> 37:52.683
Listen, I'll get some help.

37:52.685 --> 37:54.918
There's no help.

37:54.920 --> 37:57.286
This building won't even be here
in ten seconds.

37:57.288 --> 38:00.321
What you really need
is one of these.

38:09.763 --> 38:13.063
We can play all day, Barbie.

38:13.065 --> 38:15.097
I can just open up another one
over here.

38:18.067 --> 38:19.600
Dick hole.

38:21.337 --> 38:23.336
Okay. Okay.

38:23.338 --> 38:24.670
Let's get you to your feet.

38:24.672 --> 38:25.671
Let's go.

38:25.673 --> 38:26.972
There's no time.

38:26.974 --> 38:28.339
- Grace.
- There's no time.

38:28.341 --> 38:30.041
Slink was probably bluffing.

38:30.043 --> 38:31.074
He was dying.

38:31.076 --> 38:32.342
That's normally when people

38:32.344 --> 38:36.010
start taking things seriously.

38:36.012 --> 38:39.313
<i>Ten. Nine.</i>

38:39.315 --> 38:43.583
<i>Eight. Seven.</i>

38:43.585 --> 38:45.083
<i>Six. Five.</i>

38:45.085 --> 38:47.618
At least we had each other.

38:47.620 --> 38:50.353
<i>- Four. Three.</i>
- Even for a few seconds.

38:50.355 --> 38:53.188
<i>Two.</i>

38:53.190 --> 38:54.722
<i>One.</i>

38:54.724 --> 38:56.724
<i>Boom.</i>

38:56.726 --> 38:58.792
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

38:58.794 --> 39:01.160
<i>bastards and tramps,</i>

39:01.162 --> 39:02.194
<i>bloodsuckers, motherfuckers...</i>

39:02.196 --> 39:03.194
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:03.196 --> 39:04.329
<i>Road trash, and vamps.</i>

39:04.331 --> 39:05.762
Let's go. Let's go.

39:05.764 --> 39:09.198
Did you really think that I,

39:09.200 --> 39:11.700
Julian slink,

39:11.702 --> 39:14.301
master of ceremonies,

39:14.303 --> 39:16.769
god of the stage,

39:16.771 --> 39:21.340
would let a timer
steal my moment?

39:22.307 --> 39:23.774
He's not gonna do it.

39:23.776 --> 39:25.709
This is slink
we're talking about.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.310
He finally has his spotlight.

39:27.312 --> 39:29.645
<i>I was born in this building,</i>

39:29.647 --> 39:33.246
<i>and now I've returned
to destroy it.</i>

39:33.248 --> 39:37.383
<i>The prodigal son meets
oedipus Rex.</i>

39:37.385 --> 39:40.819
Sorry if you're binging this,

39:40.821 --> 39:43.987
<i>but no more
bullshit fake deaths.</i>

39:45.123 --> 39:48.123
<i>No more clever surprises.</i>

39:48.125 --> 39:50.758
Just...

39:50.760 --> 39:55.327
Good old fashioned... Catharsis.

40:20.177 --> 40:22.211
We have to go!

40:26.181 --> 40:28.682
Grace!

40:32.185 --> 40:33.184
Grace!

40:33.186 --> 40:35.753
It's too late for her!

40:35.755 --> 40:37.321
- I know.
- Grace!

40:37.323 --> 40:39.389
Please, don't leave me!

40:47.295 --> 40:49.395
I love you, Barbie.

41:14.445 --> 41:16.812
Okay. Okay.

41:18.181 --> 41:20.181
You stayed?

41:20.183 --> 41:22.416
I'm never leaving you
again, sis.

41:28.688 --> 41:31.922
And...

41:36.793 --> 41:38.293
Scene.

41:46.433 --> 41:49.000
<i>The FBI is still
investigating the attack</i>
