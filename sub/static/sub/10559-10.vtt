01:21.320 --> 01:22.753
Quite unexpected,
as you can imagine, sir.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.990
The nuns were
about to lay Sister St Ignatius

01:25.080 --> 01:29.471
to her final resting place
when they noticed that her spot was...

01:30.160 --> 01:32.310
Well, it was spoken for,
you might say, sir.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.598
Oh, watch your step there, sir.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.799
That's a Roman collar.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.438
A Roman collar, sir?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.195
George, if I'm not mistaken,
this man was a priest.

01:48.280 --> 01:49.349
Dear Lord.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.400
Sir, Father Hoobin was to conduct
the burial service.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.871
Father Hoobin is the convent chaplain.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.071
- Father.
- Detective.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.232
Reverend Mother, come quickly.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.632
George, we'll need to dig this man out.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.358
Sir, I'll get some men on that
straight away.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.918
How may I be of service, gentlemen?

02:06.200 --> 02:08.839
Reverend Mother, I'm Detective Will...

02:10.039 --> 02:11.109
Will?

02:12.680 --> 02:13.954
Susannah?

02:14.520 --> 02:15.635
Sir?

02:16.840 --> 02:20.515
Constable, allow me
to introduce my sister.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.069
Father Logan.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.869
He arrived just last night,
travelling to Winnipeg.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.591
- En route from?
- Halifax.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.997
His train didn't leave until morning,
so we put him up.

02:38.600 --> 02:39.794
Were you acquainted with him?

02:39.880 --> 02:43.156
No, but it's not uncommon for
a travelling priest to stay the night.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.031
Sir, perhaps I'll take
Father Hoobin's statement?

02:47.120 --> 02:48.951
Yes, George, thank you.

02:50.680 --> 02:51.715
Um...

02:53.200 --> 02:55.156
So you're a detective now, I see.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.554
Yes, and you a reverend mother.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.869
William.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.552
Reverend Mother,
Dr Julia Ogden, our coroner.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.394
- The Reverend Mother is...
- Your sister Susannah, yes.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.632
The news has already spread
amongst the constables.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.993
I'm so pleased to make
your acquaintance.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.389
And you.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.635
You two have work to do. Doctor.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.275
Reverend Mother.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.999
We'll speak later.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.360
I thought she was
in a cloistered convent in Montreal.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.075
As did I.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.189
Come in, Will.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.951
Dr Ogden found a fracture
in Father Logan's skull.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.234
I'll know more
once the post-mortem is completed.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.913
I must let the Archdiocese in Halifax
know of all of this.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.793
We'll take care of that.

03:51.720 --> 03:55.235
At any rate, I'll need all of
Father Logan's particulars from them.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.759
How long have you been in Toronto?

04:00.760 --> 04:01.795
Five months.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.400
Our order in Montreal was given
special instruction

04:05.480 --> 04:08.074
to establish a mission convent here

04:08.760 --> 04:12.116
and I was given dispensation
to leave the cloister.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.593
You chose not to contact me.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.273
It's been 20 years, Will.

04:20.720 --> 04:21.947
I knew that you would want to meet

04:22.040 --> 04:24.918
and I was afraid
that we would be strangers.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.279
Strangers, Susannah?

04:28.240 --> 04:29.355
I'm your brother.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.919
A 17-year-old

04:32.240 --> 04:34.470
who left to a logging camp
to get his start in the world,

04:34.560 --> 04:35.993
that's how I remember you.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.111
I don't know
this Detective Murdoch at all.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.039
We'll have to change that.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.674
How may I be of assistance
with your investigation?

04:51.280 --> 04:53.635
What did Father Logan do
once he arrived?

04:53.840 --> 04:55.319
He offered to hear confession,

04:55.400 --> 04:57.755
and since Father Hoobin was away,
I agreed.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.316
After that, he attended evening prayer.

05:01.560 --> 05:02.629
Vespers.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.589
And then, so far as I'm aware,
he went to bed

05:07.000 --> 05:08.672
around half past nine.

05:08.760 --> 05:12.230
The grounds have been thoroughly checked
and there's no sign of an intruder.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.799
But there must be.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.592
No one here had
anything to do with this.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.314
Of course not.
I just need to confirm that.

05:23.280 --> 05:27.717
I made confession with Father Logan,
as we all did.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.119
God rest his soul.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.349
Carry on, Sister.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.829
St Anthony.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.874
Yes, yes, I know.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.235
Oh.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.389
Well...

05:40.840 --> 05:44.355
We had chores, of course,
although not everyone gets theirs done.

05:45.120 --> 05:49.318
I went to Vespers and then I helped
Sister Theresa with her reading.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.912
She's Anglican, so she needs
all the help she can get.

05:53.440 --> 05:58.639
Sister Theresa, did you see or hear
anything out of the ordinary last night?

05:58.720 --> 05:59.755
None of us did.

06:00.960 --> 06:05.351
Did Father Logan seem apprehensive
or distracted in any way?

06:07.120 --> 06:08.155
No.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.038
Do you think he knew
someone was after him?

06:11.840 --> 06:14.229
When I was accepted as a novice,
I was so happy.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.591
I knew that I'd be safe in God's house.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.274
But how safe are we
if a priest can be murdered here?

06:23.240 --> 06:25.549
Sister Bernadette,
did you see Father Logan

06:25.640 --> 06:27.232
last night after confession?

06:27.840 --> 06:29.068
Only at Vespers.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.831
Then you retired for the night?

06:32.960 --> 06:35.758
No, I had kitchen duty.
But I didn't hear anything outside.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.319
Aren't chores before Vespers?

06:37.800 --> 06:39.028
Not all the time.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.356
A Catholic priest gets murdered
in a convent

06:50.440 --> 06:53.238
run by the sister you haven't seen
since the Crusades?

06:53.320 --> 06:54.355
Yes, sir.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.749
Hell of a family reunion,
pardon the expression.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.873
Have a seat, Murdoch.
How you holding up?

06:59.960 --> 07:01.029
Oh, I'm fine.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.556
We've interviewed
everyone at the convent

07:04.640 --> 07:07.757
and no one saw or heard
anything that they're admitting to.

07:07.840 --> 07:08.989
You think they're lying?

07:09.560 --> 07:10.959
They're nuns, Murdoch.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.156
They tell a fib,
they go to Limbo, don't they?

07:14.320 --> 07:16.072
More likely Purgatory.

07:16.280 --> 07:18.191
- Briefly...
- I don't understand these choices.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.953
We Protestants have Heaven or Hell,
up or down. No messing around.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.435
Yes, sir.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.911
What about this Father Hoobin character?

07:25.280 --> 07:28.158
He lives at a nearby rectory,
only visiting the convent

07:28.240 --> 07:30.674
to hear confession
and conduct evening prayer.

07:30.920 --> 07:34.435
Last night he was at the home of
a parishioner that is on his deathbed

07:34.880 --> 07:35.995
to perform extreme unction.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.438
- Extreme...
- Last rites, so to speak.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.279
Sirs, telegram
from the Archdiocese in Halifax.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.952
They have no record of a Father Logan.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.871
Hmm. Perhaps my sister was mistaken
about his home parish.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.839
Also, sir, Dr Ogden called for you.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.513
Father Logan suffered
two blows to the head,

07:55.600 --> 07:57.989
the first with something flat and broad.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.838
- A shovel, perhaps?
- Possibly.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.918
Though the second blow
caused the fracture.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.797
This time
with something small and heavy.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.598
The second blow was fatal.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.240
It likely knocked him unconscious
but it's not what killed him.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.911
The cause of death is asphyxiation.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.515
There was a sizeable amount of inhaled
soil in the oesophagus and lungs.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.873
I'm afraid he was buried alive.

08:20.480 --> 08:23.756
So, how have you and Susannah
been getting along?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.399
Oh, I hardly know.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.877
I haven't seen her or spoken to her
since she was 14

08:30.440 --> 08:33.318
and left our aunt's home
for the convent school.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.109
Later, when she joined
the cloistered nuns in Montreal,

08:37.200 --> 08:41.591
she wrote a final letter saying
the outside world was dead to her.

08:41.880 --> 08:42.948
Fourteen?

08:45.120 --> 08:46.917
That must have been painful for you.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.599
What do you have there?

08:52.800 --> 08:56.110
It's Father Logan's stomach contents.
Beef stew.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.757
Father Logan was killed on a Friday.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.078
Catholics don't eat meat that day.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.152
Perhaps he was not so devout?

09:05.360 --> 09:07.157
Perhaps he was no priest.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.319
And this one,
he invented to see in the dark.

09:12.480 --> 09:15.233
What on earth for?
Have you no lanterns, Inspector?

09:15.320 --> 09:17.356
Ah, Detective Murdoch.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.951
I was just providing the Reverend Mother
with some insights into her big brother.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.031
He built a contraption that can find
sunken boats underwater.

09:25.880 --> 09:26.915
Is that right?

09:27.160 --> 09:29.515
Thank you for keeping
my sister company, Inspector.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.791
Right, well, pleasure to meet you.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.155
And you.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.872
So this is your world now, Will.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.635
Detective.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.153
Well, not entirely.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.675
Mother had hoped
you'd be a priest one day.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.953
That wouldn't have been right for you.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.588
Why do you say that?

09:51.600 --> 09:53.830
You were forever asking
how things worked.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.509
Why they worked.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.114
A priest or someone like me tries
to comprehend God's ways,

09:59.200 --> 10:00.553
but doesn't question.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.868
I suppose you were always a detective,

10:04.520 --> 10:06.590
choosing science over faith.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.675
Judges and juries weigh facts,
not my faith.

10:11.880 --> 10:15.953
Besides, the Jesuits taught me
mathematics, science...

10:16.040 --> 10:17.155
Of course.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.149
Do you know if he's still alive?

10:21.320 --> 10:22.355
Father?

10:23.520 --> 10:24.555
No.

10:25.320 --> 10:29.154
Last time I saw him, two years ago
out west, he seemed robust.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.635
You'd think the punishment
for the grief he caused us all

10:33.720 --> 10:36.553
would have earned him an early grave
and damnation.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.079
Is that what you came here
to say, Susannah?

10:43.320 --> 10:44.389
No.

10:46.360 --> 10:49.557
I have reason to believe
Father Logan was not a priest.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.358
Yes, I've come to the same conclusion.
Why do you say so?

10:54.480 --> 10:55.879
Sister Catherine told me.

10:56.840 --> 10:57.875
Who's Sister Catherine?

11:09.720 --> 11:12.280
Why did you not tell me
about her before now?

11:12.840 --> 11:14.558
She never goes outside now.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.117
In fact, she has no contact with anyone
other than myself.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.029
Why is that?

11:23.920 --> 11:25.035
Reverend Mother.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.350
- This is your brother?
- It is, Sister.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.474
He has some questions.

11:31.640 --> 11:32.709
Very well.

11:34.440 --> 11:39.355
Sister Catherine, how do you know
that Father Logan was not a priest?

11:40.520 --> 11:41.794
God told me.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.555
God told you?

11:45.200 --> 11:47.077
Well, one of his angels, actually.

11:47.680 --> 11:50.069
But angels are messengers of God,
are they not?

11:50.800 --> 11:55.191
Sister Catherine has been chosen by God
to be a conduit to the divine.

11:55.480 --> 11:58.119
It was Mary of Magdala
who told me about Father Logan.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.073
She said he was no man of God.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.754
She said he was the Devil.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.078
And that took place in this room?

12:10.560 --> 12:13.358
On my bed. The voices often come to me
when I'm at rest.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.348
Last night I heard
the voice of the Devil himself.

12:25.560 --> 12:26.993
The Devil speaks to you as well?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.479
No, to Mary of Magdala.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.117
He raged at her, but she drove him out.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.029
She must rest.

12:37.720 --> 12:41.076
The angel that slew him
is buried beneath him.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.276
Mary spoke those words to me.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.596
Sir, what is it exactly
we're looking for?

12:51.440 --> 12:53.556
I suppose we're testing a divine theory.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.478
I believe this is an angel, sir.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.392
It's buried beneath him.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.919
The stone angel was exactly where
Sister Catherine said it would be,

13:23.000 --> 13:24.672
as instructed by Mary of Magdala.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.478
I would think
that you would be appreciative.

13:26.560 --> 13:27.754
And I am.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.196
But Sister Catherine may have
witnessed the murder

13:30.520 --> 13:32.590
- or be otherwise involved.
- Involved?

13:33.280 --> 13:35.999
It's absurd to think
that she fractured a man's skull,

13:36.080 --> 13:38.196
dragged him to his grave and buried him.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.555
I haven't yet established
that there was only one assailant.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.672
You don't understand, Will.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.877
Sister Catherine is far too frail
to make her way to the gardens.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.150
These past few weeks,
she's refused to eat.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.159
- She's starving herself?
- She's proving herself to God.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.839
Her single concern is piety

13:54.920 --> 13:58.708
and I firmly believe that she has been
rewarded with divine communion.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.313
Be that as it may,

14:03.240 --> 14:05.356
I find it hard to believe
that God intervenes

14:05.440 --> 14:07.556
in murder investigations, Susannah.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.870
Who are we to assume God's priorities?

14:10.880 --> 14:12.108
The fact is, William,

14:12.400 --> 14:13.799
the angels speak to Sister Catherine.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.235
Or have you no faith
in such things any more?

14:19.920 --> 14:22.115
And then just as the chapter concludes,

14:22.200 --> 14:25.192
our heroes realise they must rush back
to save the queen

14:25.280 --> 14:27.350
from Sekmet's evil bio-cannon.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.234
This murder mystery of yours is
starting to sound peculiar, George.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.469
Well, thank you, sir.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.150
Although it doesn't hold a stitch
to this scenario.

14:35.480 --> 14:38.358
God having his angels talk
to Sister Catherine?

14:39.520 --> 14:42.751
It must mean
that angels watch over this place.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.870
In fact, they could be listening
to our very words right this minute.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.235
Sir, what are you looking at?

14:51.160 --> 14:53.355
I think we know
where our angel came from, George.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.637
Indeed. Sir, I believe
there's some blood here.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.555
Yes, George.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.869
This is it.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.031
This is the scene of the crime.

15:06.880 --> 15:07.915
Very good, sir.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.149
Wait.

15:17.880 --> 15:18.949
A crucifix.

15:23.440 --> 15:24.555
A tin box.

15:25.560 --> 15:26.834
It's empty.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.472
<i>You wanted
to show me something, Doctor?</i>

15:30.560 --> 15:31.959
<i>It's a syphilitic lesion.</i>

15:32.400 --> 15:35.278
And in mind of the circumstances
of this case, I had a thought.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.675
Which is?

15:37.280 --> 15:38.998
Are you familiar with the Virgin Cure?

15:39.960 --> 15:41.188
The mistaken belief that

15:41.280 --> 15:43.999
intimate relations
with a virgin will cure disease.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.355
What better place
to find a virgin than a convent?

15:48.040 --> 15:49.314
The Virgin Cure?

15:49.800 --> 15:51.791
I can't imagine anything more evil.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.037
If our victim was attempting
to avail himself of this cure,

15:55.120 --> 15:56.997
it could be why he was killed.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.199
I will speak to the sisters, of course,

15:59.280 --> 16:00.679
but I'm sure that they would have
come to me

16:00.760 --> 16:02.876
if there had been
any attempt to molest them.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.833
I found this in the garden, as well,

16:05.920 --> 16:08.559
where I believe the victim was
rendered unconscious.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.279
Do you know who it belongs to?

16:11.960 --> 16:15.714
No. But I'll ask and see
if anyone has lost theirs.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.991
Also...

16:19.240 --> 16:21.390
We found blood in the garden,
no doubt the victim's,

16:22.560 --> 16:25.393
but it's reasonable to assume
that the killer was splattered

16:25.760 --> 16:26.988
during the attack.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.029
And?

16:29.560 --> 16:33.189
I've sent some of my men to the convent
to search for any items of clothing.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.474
You did what?

16:35.120 --> 16:37.680
The killer is not among us, Will,
and I insist that you stop

16:37.760 --> 16:39.751
this unseemly pursuit of yours.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.436
I will have my men
return to the station,

16:46.400 --> 16:48.277
once they have completed their duties.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.115
Sir,

17:01.640 --> 17:03.073
there's been a development.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.553
Ah, sir, there you are.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.156
We found it in the convent laundry.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.032
A man's undergarment.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.957
<i>I believe I need
to visit the rectory.</i>

17:33.680 --> 17:35.193
This was found in the convent.

17:36.440 --> 17:37.589
Yes, that's mine.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.118
I usually leave my laundry
at the convent

17:40.200 --> 17:41.474
for the nuns to attend to.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.358
You will note that there's blood on it.

17:43.440 --> 17:44.714
Detective, it's my blood.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.114
Here, I'll show you.

18:05.920 --> 18:09.037
Self-flagellation is performed
as religious discipline

18:09.120 --> 18:11.270
or as penance for wrongdoing.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.951
Which is the case for you,
Father Hoobin?

18:15.160 --> 18:16.957
That is between myself and God.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.075
No.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.230
No, that is between you
and the Constabulary.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.594
I will be needing your answer.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.674
My answer is that I told you
I was visiting the Bishop.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.754
Check with him.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.956
Will, I'm so glad you're here.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.473
We left on unpleasant terms yesterday.

18:38.560 --> 18:39.993
Oh, don't worry about that.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.510
The angel spoke to Sister Catherine
again this morning.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.395
Come.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.154
Sister Catherine.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.749
The cross is lost.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.116
What cross? Lost where?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.115
The garden.

19:18.600 --> 19:21.398
She must be referring to the crucifix
that you found there,

19:22.000 --> 19:23.433
but no one told her.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.793
Do you believe now?

19:27.160 --> 19:28.434
Sister Catherine,

19:29.400 --> 19:30.549
whose voice did you hear?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.956
Mary of Magdala.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.428
And no one else?

19:38.880 --> 19:39.995
Sister?

19:40.520 --> 19:41.748
- Sister Catherine.
- My...

19:42.680 --> 19:44.716
Cross... Help me...

19:47.360 --> 19:48.554
Oh, dear God!

19:49.640 --> 19:50.789
Sisters!

19:51.880 --> 19:53.393
Sisters, we need help!

19:53.520 --> 19:54.794
Sister Catherine.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.079
You must convince her to eat.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.830
Starvation and lack of water
will kill her.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.434
I suppose you've reasoned

20:05.520 --> 20:08.114
that her condition explains
her communion with God?

20:09.040 --> 20:12.271
Susannah, she could die.
I should be taking her to a hospital.

20:12.360 --> 20:14.271
No. We'll see to her.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.430
Have you lost
your faith, William?

21:16.120 --> 21:17.599
You have a responsibility,
William.

21:17.680 --> 21:18.999
I have a responsibility to...

21:19.080 --> 21:20.832
I need you to keep your faith.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.915
I don't just have
a responsibility to you,

21:24.000 --> 21:25.558
I have a responsibility to God.

21:28.640 --> 21:29.914
We have to see it through.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.476
I don't have any faith left.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.638
So figure me this, George.

21:45.720 --> 21:47.199
These papists believe in celibacy...

21:47.280 --> 21:49.953
Er, Catholics, Henry.
I think they prefer Catholics.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.759
Okay, well, these Catholics believe
in abstinence for their priest

21:52.840 --> 21:55.718
- because it brings them closer to God?
- Yes, correct.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.917
Yes, but those practising abstinence
don't have children,

21:59.160 --> 22:01.230
and so, by Darwin's theory
of natural selection,

22:01.320 --> 22:03.880
won't pass on their inclination
towards taking holy orders.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.036
Pretty soon,
no one wants to be a priest.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.832
So are we running out
of priests, Henry? Is this a problem?

22:09.920 --> 22:12.798
I mean, are we entering some sort
of worldwide priest shortage?

22:12.880 --> 22:14.677
You're missing
the point, George.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.154
George!

22:16.240 --> 22:18.231
Henry! Can you hear my voice?

22:18.960 --> 22:22.270
Yes, sir. Are you trapped
underground somewhere?

22:22.920 --> 22:27.675
No, no. Follow the sound of my voice
until you see a clay pipe.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.478
Just follow my voice.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.194
Sir, I think we found you.
The pipe leads out here.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.952
Are you in the garden
where the murder took place?

22:35.040 --> 22:36.109
Yes, sir.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.276
I hardly think that Sister Catherine's
conduit to God was a drainage pipe.

22:40.880 --> 22:44.759
It's part of an old plumbing system,
very efficient at conveying sound.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.115
It must have been covered up
in the last renovation.

22:52.440 --> 22:55.318
So all this time she was hearing
conversations in the garden?

22:56.080 --> 22:57.752
And most likely the murder, as well,

22:57.840 --> 23:01.037
and the killer, or killers,
speaking after the fact.

23:02.240 --> 23:03.878
I need to talk to her again.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.714
We're just nursing her back to health.
She's in no condition.

23:07.520 --> 23:12.150
Susannah, these divine messages
could be the key to solving this murder.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.076
Well, I keep a written record
of the messages.

23:16.680 --> 23:17.749
That will have to do.

23:33.360 --> 23:34.475
Detective?

23:35.160 --> 23:36.195
Sir, I spoke with the Bishop.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.396
He confirms that
on the night of the murder,

23:38.480 --> 23:39.549
he and Father Hoobin discussed

23:39.640 --> 23:41.392
a plan to repair
the church in Millbrook.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.034
That's Hoobin's hometown.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.793
So if Father Hoobin was with the Bishop,
he can't be our killer.

23:45.880 --> 23:49.111
Yes, sir, but strangely,
Father Hoobin had with him $950,

23:49.200 --> 23:51.236
which he just gave the Bishop
to go towards the repairs.

23:51.880 --> 23:54.872
Really? Where does a priest
get money like that?

23:54.960 --> 23:55.995
Well, good question, sir.

23:56.080 --> 23:58.435
The other strange thing is
the wife of the dying parishioner

23:58.520 --> 23:59.839
that Hoobin had visited prior

23:59.920 --> 24:01.956
said that he left their house
at 9:00 p.m.,

24:02.040 --> 24:05.237
but the Bishop said Father Hoobin
didn't arrive until quarter of ten.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.276
Now, that trip should have taken
20 minutes, not 45.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.479
I can't help wondering what delayed him.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.115
After I left the parishioner's,
I stopped here at the rectory

24:16.200 --> 24:18.475
to pick up some documents
and then I carried on my way.

24:18.760 --> 24:22.878
I see. If I may,
how is it you came into nearly $1,000

24:23.200 --> 24:24.838
to give to the church in Millbrook?

24:24.920 --> 24:27.992
It was my inheritance.
I'd been saving it for a good cause.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.148
That's very commendable.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.117
Detective Murdoch,
I didn't kill that man.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.592
I wasn't at the convent.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.999
I believe you were.

24:36.440 --> 24:39.591
You encountered Father Logan,
realised that he was an imposter,

24:39.680 --> 24:42.148
so he attacked you to silence you.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.438
Invent any scenario you like.

24:44.520 --> 24:45.873
What about the self-flagellation?

24:45.960 --> 24:48.793
Wasn't it over the guilt you felt
for committing murder?

24:50.840 --> 24:52.398
I do have guilt, yes,
but not for that reason.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.471
I believe I've lost my faith.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.672
Is your first name William?

24:58.440 --> 25:00.032
Yes, it is.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.429
You were in the convent garden
earlier today.

25:02.520 --> 25:04.192
A woman asked you
if you'd lost your faith.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.676
- Who was it?
- Sister Theresa.

25:08.720 --> 25:12.076
No. A novice would never address
a priest by his first name.

25:12.720 --> 25:13.755
She and I became friends.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.469
In the most ironic of ways,

25:16.560 --> 25:19.154
she is discovering her faith
just as I am losing mine.

25:21.240 --> 25:24.630
You and Father Hoobin had a conversation
in the garden earlier today.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.229
Yes.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.271
He says he found you there alone.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.959
Were you looking for this?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.069
That's not mine.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.269
This is.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.639
Sister Theresa...

25:47.440 --> 25:48.509
Sister Bernadette?

25:49.720 --> 25:51.199
What seems to be the trouble?

25:51.280 --> 25:53.794
Nothing important. I'll come back.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.429
Thank you.

26:05.360 --> 26:06.475
Sister Bernadette?

26:08.760 --> 26:10.273
What has you so upset?

26:11.560 --> 26:14.199
I received a scolding
from the Reverend Mother.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.478
Somehow she heard about us
wagering on card games.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.029
Excuse me.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.799
Hello, Detective.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.075
Sister St Anthony.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.958
Yes, we're burying
Sister St Ignatius later today.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.917
This morning
I went to see all was ready.

26:33.240 --> 26:36.198
Her rosary is missing from her body,
crucifix and all.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.517
I think someone stole it.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.715
What's this, then?
Quotes from the drainpipe?

26:48.080 --> 26:49.274
Yes, sir.

26:49.360 --> 26:52.830
I'm convinced the solution to this crime
is here somewhere.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.832
I believe Sister Catherine overheard
a series of conversations,

26:55.920 --> 26:57.194
including one with the killer.

26:57.480 --> 26:59.550
But before her seizure,
Sister Catherine said,

27:00.120 --> 27:02.714
"My cross. Help me find... "

27:04.000 --> 27:05.069
It?

27:07.240 --> 27:10.994
In that case,
perhaps it's referring to the crucifix

27:11.080 --> 27:12.957
that I found in the garden. And if so,

27:13.720 --> 27:15.119
she may have overheard the killer

27:15.200 --> 27:17.475
still at the scene of the crime
looking for it.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.597
- And speaking to a third party?
- Exactly.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.553
Sirs, we've had a response
to the photograph that we sent around.

27:23.640 --> 27:26.518
It seems our victim's name
is Tommy Tasker.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.632
He was arrested a month ago
for bank robbery,

27:28.720 --> 27:30.995
but escaped
while being transferred to court.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.957
- This was in Toronto?
- No, sir, Millbrook.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.318
Father Hoobin's hometown.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.239
Millbrook's barely a hamlet.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.993
Tommy Tasker and Father Hoobin
must have crossed paths.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.952
Father Hoobin,
do you recognise this man?

27:46.760 --> 27:48.910
All I know is
he called himself Father Logan.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.558
His real name is Tommy Tasker.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.069
That name sound familiar?

27:53.040 --> 27:54.075
No.

27:57.120 --> 28:01.159
Father, I have a telegram here
from the Millbrook Constabulary.

28:01.920 --> 28:07.199
It pertains to an attempted robbery
nine years ago on July 17, 1889.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.394
Could you please read
the names of the co-accused?

28:16.800 --> 28:18.153
"Tommy Tasker and Billy Hoobin. "

28:21.960 --> 28:23.518
We were altar boys.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.198
But we started getting into trouble.
We ran together for a few years.

28:27.280 --> 28:29.919
But, after I decided to become a priest,
I never saw Tommy again

28:30.000 --> 28:32.719
until he showed up in that grave.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.393
For the last time, I didn't kill him.

28:36.320 --> 28:37.992
Why did you lie about knowing him?

28:46.760 --> 28:48.432
Father William Hoobin,

28:48.520 --> 28:51.239
you are under arrest
for the murder of Tommy Tasker.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.549
Susannah.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.155
What brings you here?

29:05.600 --> 29:08.319
Is it true you've arrested Father Hoobin
for the murder?

29:09.480 --> 29:10.629
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.635
William...

29:16.160 --> 29:18.674
I can't let an innocent man hang
for my sin.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.189
Your sin?

29:21.840 --> 29:23.592
Father Hoobin didn't kill that man.

29:24.440 --> 29:25.475
I did.

29:31.760 --> 29:32.795
It was dark.

29:33.800 --> 29:37.236
After Vespers, I went
for a walk before retiring.

29:37.320 --> 29:40.471
Sister St Ignatius was
very much on my mind.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.793
She was like a mother to me.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.960
Reverend Mother,
please, the circumstances.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.029
I was in the garden when Father Logan,

29:52.120 --> 29:55.112
or Tommy Tasker, as you say,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.230
rushed up behind me and threw me down.

29:58.720 --> 29:59.789
He...

30:01.960 --> 30:03.234
Did he interfere with you?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.035
He tried.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.390
I managed to push him off briefly.

30:09.080 --> 30:11.878
I grabbed a shovel and hit him with it.

30:12.680 --> 30:15.672
He fell and then he got back up again.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.354
And the next thing I knew,

30:18.440 --> 30:21.671
I had a stone angel in my hand
and he was on the ground.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.235
Susannah,

30:25.080 --> 30:26.718
you acted in self-defence.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.795
Why not simply tell me this
from the beginning?

30:31.520 --> 30:32.919
I killed a priest, Will.

30:33.320 --> 30:34.799
Or at least I thought he was one.

30:36.200 --> 30:39.351
Who would believe that a priest
could commit a sexual assault?

30:40.160 --> 30:45.553
Not the Archdiocese or the Holy See,
and, most certainly, not the police.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.596
So the voices
Sister Catherine heard were...

30:49.680 --> 30:50.954
Mine and Tasker's.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.870
And, in all this,
your crucifix got torn off?

30:54.760 --> 30:57.797
Yes, I looked everywhere for it, but...

30:59.080 --> 31:02.959
So I took Sister St Ignatius's
as a replacement, I'm ashamed to say.

31:03.040 --> 31:05.793
So when you were searching
for the crucifix in the garden,

31:05.880 --> 31:07.791
who was it you said "help me find it"
to, if it wasn't Tasker?

31:09.520 --> 31:11.272
There was no one else there but me.

31:11.400 --> 31:14.119
So no one helped you carry Tasker's body
to the grave and dump it in?

31:14.480 --> 31:15.674
No.

31:16.520 --> 31:17.635
Susannah,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.514
I believe Sister Catherine heard a voice

31:22.360 --> 31:24.430
calling out to a third party for help,

31:25.640 --> 31:28.029
saying, "My cross, help me find it. "

31:29.560 --> 31:30.879
There was someone else there with you.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.998
Sister Catherine was delirious.
You said so yourself.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.719
It was just me.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.868
I killed a man, Will. I was frantic.

31:40.920 --> 31:44.037
I checked for a pulse,
but it was too late.

31:46.080 --> 31:47.911
I didn't know what else to do.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.396
Tasker wasn't dead when he was buried.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.636
If you checked for a pulse,
you would have found one.

32:01.800 --> 32:04.678
Well, if he was near dead,
then his pulse would have been weak.

32:04.760 --> 32:07.228
Reverend Mother, you're lying.

32:19.640 --> 32:20.789
Listen, Murdoch,

32:22.040 --> 32:24.634
if your sister won't tell us
who the accomplice is,

32:25.200 --> 32:27.839
we're just gonna have to
figure this out for ourselves.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.638
Could be this third party's the killer

32:29.720 --> 32:32.393
and that Susannah was only
involved after the fact.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.875
That distinction is
less than comforting, sir,

32:34.960 --> 32:39.078
but I agree Susannah appears to be
protecting someone.

32:39.840 --> 32:42.274
Tasker knew that Father Hoobin was
chaplain to a convent.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.350
If Tasker was really after
the Virgin Cure,

32:45.440 --> 32:46.998
it would make sense
that he would go there.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.230
He stole some of Father Hoobin's
vestments from the rectory

32:50.320 --> 32:51.992
while Hoobin was
at the parishioner's house.

32:53.160 --> 32:54.388
That makes sense.

32:54.480 --> 32:55.799
So what's your problem?

32:59.280 --> 33:00.633
- Sir.
- What?

33:01.120 --> 33:02.348
The cross.

33:06.520 --> 33:10.069
Sir, a Catholic nun loses her crucifix
in the middle of a garden.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.710
Why does she call it a cross?

33:12.920 --> 33:14.433
Doesn't make sense.

33:14.520 --> 33:15.919
No, it doesn't.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.109
Unless that nun was raised
as an Anglican.

33:24.840 --> 33:27.513
"For my salvation is near to come,

33:28.080 --> 33:30.116
"and my righteousness to be revealed.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.149
"Blessed is the... "

33:32.480 --> 33:33.595
Sisters?

33:36.440 --> 33:37.555
Sister Theresa,

33:38.760 --> 33:39.988
may I see your rosary?

33:40.680 --> 33:41.795
Please?

33:42.800 --> 33:43.869
Of course.

33:49.240 --> 33:50.309
Hmm.

33:51.080 --> 33:52.308
This has years of wear.

33:55.640 --> 33:57.790
It belonged
to Sister Ignatius, didn't it?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.115
Sister Bernadette.

34:04.360 --> 34:06.954
I was working in the kitchen
when I heard a noise outside.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.833
I went out and found Theresa
and the father in a struggle.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.512
He was on top of her, so...

34:14.400 --> 34:15.879
I hit him with the shovel.

34:17.320 --> 34:18.389
Then what?

34:18.960 --> 34:20.109
He still wouldn't stop.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.911
- So I picked up the stone angel...
- Bernadette, please.

34:27.679 --> 34:29.556
I was the one
who hit him with the angel.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.475
He tried to rape me.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.469
I thought he was going to
go after me again.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.516
And you both decided to bury him.

34:42.360 --> 34:43.918
The father
would have simply disappeared,

34:45.000 --> 34:47.719
to catch his train to Winnipeg
for all anyone would know.

34:48.840 --> 34:52.674
But when we saw his hand sticking out
of the dirt the next day, we realised...

34:52.760 --> 34:54.591
We thought he was dead
when we buried him.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.478
Detective Murdoch,

34:57.480 --> 34:58.674
you must believe that.

34:59.680 --> 35:00.999
We're not monsters.

35:03.240 --> 35:05.435
Why let the Reverend Mother
take the blame

35:05.520 --> 35:07.954
for what you had done
and surely go to the gallows?

35:08.320 --> 35:09.435
She insisted.

35:10.360 --> 35:13.318
That time you saw me crying,
I had just told her the truth.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.873
I pleaded with her
not to confess to our sins,

35:17.440 --> 35:18.589
but she wouldn't hear it.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.718
She said it was better this way.

35:37.360 --> 35:38.429
This way, please.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.797
Susannah, I don't understand.

35:49.120 --> 35:52.476
Father Hoobin was entirely innocent
of any crime, Will.

35:52.960 --> 35:56.270
Sisters Bernadette and Theresa were
faced with an agonising choice

35:56.360 --> 35:57.793
for survival's sake.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.437
In each instance, my duty was clear.

36:01.640 --> 36:04.518
We must sacrifice our own interests
to protect the innocent.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.317
What are you hiding from me?

36:11.400 --> 36:14.233
I must go now.
They'll be needing lawyers.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.036
Glad to see this case wrapped up,

36:32.120 --> 36:35.590
and with your sister no part
in the murder and so on and so forth.

36:36.040 --> 36:38.713
But the thought of two nuns
swinging from a rope, well...

36:41.080 --> 36:43.150
The case is wrapped up, Murdoch, right?

36:43.800 --> 36:44.994
I suppose so, sir.

36:45.720 --> 36:49.474
But it troubles me that once Tasker was
knocked to the ground,

36:49.560 --> 36:53.030
they didn't simply run or call for help.

36:53.800 --> 36:56.075
Sister Theresa did not need
to finish him off.

36:56.160 --> 36:58.230
Well, maybe not,
but with something like that...

36:58.360 --> 36:59.873
Sirs, excuse me.

37:00.480 --> 37:03.790
From the Millbrook Constabulary,
Tommy Tasker's complete file.

37:03.880 --> 37:06.838
I've perused it and it is enlightening,
to say the least.

37:07.160 --> 37:09.390
Especially this part.

37:11.320 --> 37:15.154
Tommy Tasker was arrested for seduction
five years ago in Millbrook.

37:15.240 --> 37:16.639
Seduction, ah.

37:16.720 --> 37:19.553
Promised marriage to a girl to win
her favours and then backed out, did he?

37:19.640 --> 37:23.110
Yes, sir. And the man who brought
the charges against Tommy Tasker

37:23.200 --> 37:24.599
was Billy Hoobin.

37:24.920 --> 37:25.955
What's going on?

37:28.560 --> 37:31.711
Sir, the young woman
that Tasker attacked

37:31.800 --> 37:34.792
was a Mary Albert from Bethany, Ontario.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.152
Mary of Bethany.

37:37.240 --> 37:38.832
What's Bethany got to do with anything?

37:38.920 --> 37:40.990
Sister Catherine said that
one of the voices she heard

37:41.080 --> 37:43.389
was that of Mary Magdala.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.075
The biblical Mary Magdala was
from Bethany.

37:46.560 --> 37:49.393
Mary Magdala is Mary of Bethany.

37:49.840 --> 37:52.912
And our Mary from Bethany
is Mary Albert.

37:53.840 --> 37:54.989
So who's Mary Albert?

37:55.880 --> 37:58.599
The young woman
Father Hoobin lied to protect.

38:03.760 --> 38:04.875
Have a seat.

38:04.960 --> 38:06.552
Why is Sister Theresa here?

38:07.200 --> 38:08.713
Oh, I think you know, Father.

38:11.200 --> 38:14.078
Five years ago, Tommy Tasker was
arrested for seduction.

38:14.880 --> 38:17.314
The complainant was one Billy Hoobin

38:18.000 --> 38:21.310
and the alleged victim was Mary Albert.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.474
Sister Theresa,

38:26.360 --> 38:29.113
that was the religious name you were
given when you became a novice, yes?

38:30.480 --> 38:31.515
Yes.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.195
Father Hoobin,

38:34.960 --> 38:38.236
the crime of seduction carries with it
a prison sentence.

38:40.280 --> 38:43.511
Alerting the authorities
to an occurrence of seduction would be

38:43.600 --> 38:47.593
an ideal way of ridding oneself
of a rival for a woman's affections,

38:48.200 --> 38:49.235
wouldn't it?

38:49.320 --> 38:50.639
So what happened, then?

38:51.600 --> 38:53.511
Missy here was free and clear of Tasker.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.910
I reckon you offered
a shoulder to cry on.

38:57.440 --> 38:58.714
But she didn't want you.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.276
Still pining for Tasker, was she?

39:02.120 --> 39:05.874
Alas, after a short stint
in prison, Tasker reunited with Mary.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.516
Right about the time you left Millbrook
to study for the priesthood.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.790
No one likes being rejected, Father,

39:13.280 --> 39:14.759
but that seems a bit drastic to me.

39:15.040 --> 39:18.077
So as the years went on,
Tasker moved his way up

39:18.280 --> 39:20.316
from petty theft to bank robbery.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.439
With his lovely Mary
by his side the whole time.

39:25.560 --> 39:29.473
Most recently, Tasker stole nearly
$1,000 from a Millbrook bank.

39:30.640 --> 39:34.918
Strangely, the authorities were
tipped off by an anonymous letter.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.672
Tasker went to jail,
Mary Albert vanished

39:40.160 --> 39:41.513
and so did the money.

39:42.720 --> 39:44.392
Why don't you two take it from here?

39:55.280 --> 39:56.429
Tommy was a brute.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.197
Not at first, but then it started.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.076
I realised I should have been
with Billy all along.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.518
So you took the money and ran?

40:14.440 --> 40:17.876
I needed to hide from Tommy
and I knew that Billy would take me in.

40:21.560 --> 40:23.312
When Mary showed up at my door
two months ago,

40:23.400 --> 40:25.072
I realised nothing had changed.

40:27.160 --> 40:28.309
My love for her never died.

40:29.480 --> 40:32.153
I wrote to the Holy Father
to be released from my vows.

40:37.080 --> 40:38.559
We were planning to marry.

40:40.280 --> 40:41.918
But then Tasker showed up.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.396
On the other side of the confessional.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.191
He wanted the money

40:49.560 --> 40:52.358
and I was going to give it to him
just to make him go away.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.878
It was gone.

41:00.520 --> 41:03.751
I'd hidden it in a tin box
in the garden.

41:03.840 --> 41:07.435
And when I took Tommy there,
he saw that it was empty and...

41:08.240 --> 41:10.470
He thought I'd lied to him.
He attacked me.

41:14.120 --> 41:17.317
I'm sure if Bernadette hadn't
come along, he would have killed me.

41:21.360 --> 41:24.238
So you killed him first
while you had the chance?

41:28.200 --> 41:29.349
It was him or me.

41:32.040 --> 41:34.474
And fabricated the story
of the attempted rape?

41:36.400 --> 41:38.595
I needed Bernadette's help
to hide the body.

41:40.520 --> 41:43.717
She never would have if she'd known
that I'd killed a man on purpose.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.556
And she wouldn't have had to do it
had I not

41:47.080 --> 41:48.274
taken the money.

41:50.280 --> 41:51.474
You took it?

41:53.000 --> 41:55.673
Why? That was our nest egg, Billy.
Why did you do that?

41:56.080 --> 41:58.548
To absolve me of my sins, I hoped,

41:58.640 --> 42:00.870
and ease the guilt
of leaving the Church.

42:00.960 --> 42:03.110
I wanted Mary and I to have
a fresh start, yes,

42:03.400 --> 42:04.833
but with a clean break from the past.

42:05.320 --> 42:08.118
If you hadn't done that,
none of this would have happened!

42:08.880 --> 42:10.916
All Tommy wanted was the money!

42:23.480 --> 42:27.109
Father Hoobin will be required
to testify against Sister Theresa.

42:27.360 --> 42:28.839
And Sister Bernadette?

42:29.000 --> 42:31.070
We'll petition the courts for leniency.

42:31.160 --> 42:33.833
I doubt any judge will want
to punish her too severely.

42:34.040 --> 42:36.395
But there will be punishment
of some duration.

42:36.920 --> 42:39.832
This terrible business has
quite crushed our spirit here.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.516
My heart is heavy
knowing the full truth.

42:44.280 --> 42:46.396
It's not how I imagined our reunion.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.551
I've spoken harshly to you at times
these last few days, Will.

42:52.880 --> 42:54.108
I regret that.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.678
You were in a difficult position.

42:57.920 --> 42:58.989
Thank you.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.995
It's my hope that we can
find time for each other now.

43:04.080 --> 43:05.752
I know that there must be
many demands on you...

43:05.840 --> 43:06.909
Will...

43:08.800 --> 43:11.519
I will be returning
to the cloister in Montreal.

43:13.920 --> 43:16.036
But we've only just found each other.

43:16.480 --> 43:17.754
I know.

43:18.880 --> 43:20.279
I feel the same way.

43:21.640 --> 43:22.789
Then why leave?

43:27.280 --> 43:31.068
My reasons for confessing to the murder
were not based solely on protecting

43:31.160 --> 43:33.276
those that I assumed to be innocent.

43:35.640 --> 43:36.709
The truth is

43:40.800 --> 43:42.552
God has called me home.

43:44.920 --> 43:46.114
Called you home?

43:47.440 --> 43:49.237
I've been unwell for some time

43:51.080 --> 43:52.274
and I haven't long.

43:55.760 --> 43:58.832
You wondered why I hadn't told you
that I was in Toronto.

44:00.160 --> 44:02.276
I didn't think that God would
give me the strength...

44:02.360 --> 44:03.429
No.

44:03.520 --> 44:07.149
To tell my brother,
whom I love so deeply...

44:15.920 --> 44:18.718
I hope that you will forgive me
for wanting to spend my final days

44:18.800 --> 44:20.791
in prayer and contemplation.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.309
Can you forgive me?

44:27.480 --> 44:28.629
Of course.

44:33.120 --> 44:34.189
Come.

44:36.320 --> 44:37.673
Pray with me.
