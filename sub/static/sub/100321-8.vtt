WEBVTT

00:00.198 --> 00:02.150
Well, this is a big moment

00:02.226 --> 00:05.085
in the expansion
of Rosebud Motel Group.

00:05.198 --> 00:09.182
Today we cut the ribbon
on a new Rosebud Motel.

00:09.266 --> 00:11.141
Can I take my blindfold off
now?

00:11.225 --> 00:14.263
Oh, not yet, honey, we gotta
wait for Johnny's big reveal.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.717
- Okay.
- Let's get to it,

00:15.802 --> 00:17.116
let's cut the ribbon.

00:17.201 --> 00:18.268
- Roland.
- Okay.

00:18.353 --> 00:19.557
- Wanna hold that? Stevie,
- Yeah.

00:19.641 --> 00:21.343
- you wanna hold this, hold it up?
- Mr. Rose, do we really need

00:21.427 --> 00:23.215
- to do this.
- Yeah, yes, yes we do.

00:23.299 --> 00:24.615
Moira, scissors.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.156
Hey, how about a drum roll,
Stevie?

00:26.267 --> 00:27.836
- I'd rather not.
- Yeah, you know what,

00:27.920 --> 00:29.434
I'm just gonna take off
the blindfold.

00:29.519 --> 00:32.818
Okay. Moira, scissors please.

00:34.004 --> 00:36.488
Okay, what are these?
These won't cut a ribbon.

00:36.573 --> 00:38.360
They're cuticle shears, John.

00:38.444 --> 00:41.972
Do you expect hedge clippers
to be drawn from my purse?

00:42.056 --> 00:43.713
Okay, alright,

00:43.797 --> 00:45.889
hold it up and hold it taut
please.

00:45.973 --> 00:47.804
I'm sorry, taut?

00:47.888 --> 00:49.630
What is that, old English?

00:50.321 --> 00:51.618
How bout I hold it tight?

00:51.703 --> 00:52.889
Mr. Rose, just cut the ribbon.

00:52.973 --> 00:54.175
- Pull it, pull it.
- Okay.

00:54.269 --> 00:55.692
- Here we go. Okay.
- Cut it.

00:55.777 --> 00:57.260
How long is this gonna take,
Johnny,

00:57.463 --> 00:59.076
should I cancel my New Year's
plans?

00:59.160 --> 01:01.781
Okay, you know what,
just drop the ribbon, drop it.

01:01.866 --> 01:03.161
- Alright.
- Yay.

01:03.246 --> 01:06.490
Okay, step one now complete,

01:06.657 --> 01:07.899
onto step two.

01:07.984 --> 01:11.251
- And what would that entail?
- Deep cleaning the rooms.

01:11.336 --> 01:14.178
Well, I'd like to be put
to use, what's step three?

01:14.262 --> 01:16.050
You know, I think I need
to lie down,

01:16.134 --> 01:18.226
that blindfold was quite taut.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.658
That's me in front
of a volcano.

01:25.743 --> 01:26.747
Yeah.

01:27.014 --> 01:31.008
In the jungle,
in outer space,

01:31.140 --> 01:32.502
that's another volcano.

01:32.587 --> 01:34.285
As maid of honour,
I pick the second volcano.

01:34.369 --> 01:36.633
Okay, you are hanging onto
that job by a thread.

01:36.718 --> 01:38.725
Ray, do you have anything
that'll make us look

01:38.809 --> 01:40.107
a little less like the kind
of couple

01:40.191 --> 01:41.457
that gets married
at a theme park?

01:41.541 --> 01:43.285
Oh, I think what David
is trying to say

01:43.370 --> 01:44.463
is maybe something
a little simpler.

01:44.547 --> 01:45.716
Yeah I'm looking
for understated,

01:45.800 --> 01:47.112
Annie Leibowitz
for Vanity Fair.

01:47.197 --> 01:48.991
I want us to look like
two very rich people

01:49.075 --> 01:50.688
that have just woken up
after fainting

01:50.772 --> 01:52.141
- on a dusty old couch.
- Mmm.

01:52.226 --> 01:54.083
I don't know if you've
thought about wedding favours,

01:54.167 --> 01:56.417
but might I suggest
mouse pads,

01:56.735 --> 01:58.689
I got thousands downstairs.

01:59.022 --> 02:00.263
Let me get you some samples.

02:00.347 --> 02:01.435
Wonderful.

02:02.964 --> 02:05.007
Okay, as maid of honour,
I have to say...

02:05.091 --> 02:06.443
You don't have to say
anything.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.619
Anyway, I thought
it would be festive

02:08.703 --> 02:11.361
if I got you a little
pre-wedding gift.

02:11.445 --> 02:12.667
- What?
- Mhmm.

02:12.751 --> 02:15.539
I am sending you
to get pampered

02:15.623 --> 02:18.379
- before this afternoon's shoot.
- Do I get pampered?

02:18.464 --> 02:20.196
No, you get to drive him
to the spa

02:20.280 --> 02:22.155
where he will indulge
in a relaxing

02:22.239 --> 02:24.305
five minute scalp massage

02:24.390 --> 02:25.984
followed by some light sun.

02:26.068 --> 02:27.132
That'll also give me
enough time

02:27.216 --> 02:28.770
to art direct this situation

02:28.854 --> 02:30.641
'cause clearly Ray wouldn't
know my aesthetic

02:30.726 --> 02:33.301
- if it ran him over.
- I'm sorry, did you say sun?

02:33.769 --> 02:36.386
Yeah, like a,
a kiss on the cheeks,

02:36.470 --> 02:38.132
uh, um a gentle spray.

02:38.556 --> 02:40.174
Okay, well, thanks for
the gift, David,

02:40.259 --> 02:41.580
but no thank you.
I'll take it.

02:41.665 --> 02:43.928
Actually sounds less like
a gift and more like a chore.

02:44.013 --> 02:45.723
Okay, I am doing you a favour.

02:45.808 --> 02:46.541
- Oh.
- Okay.

02:46.626 --> 02:48.909
Stevie, take our photo please
for a moment, fast please.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.272
- Ooh, uh.
- Okay.

02:52.357 --> 02:55.575
Yeah, see, side by side my
Mediterranean complexion

02:55.660 --> 02:57.451
makes you look
a little anemic

02:57.535 --> 02:59.192
so the spray will
just even it out.

02:59.276 --> 03:02.119
Okay, it's not that...
bad.

03:02.204 --> 03:04.414
Okay, well, the lighting
is not good so. I mean...

03:04.498 --> 03:05.850
- Hmm.
- Just as an example,

03:05.934 --> 03:08.454
here is a sample mouse pad
that Jocelyn made

03:08.561 --> 03:10.079
for the computer lab
at school.

03:10.483 --> 03:14.217
The Under the Sea theme is only
available during winter months.

03:27.521 --> 03:30.527
My God, Ted,
what are you doing here?

03:30.611 --> 03:32.442
I wanted to surprise you.

03:32.526 --> 03:35.663
- Oh my God, okay, babe, hi.
- Hi, hi.

03:35.747 --> 03:37.708
- Hmm.
- Hm.

03:37.792 --> 03:40.145
Hi, uh sorry there
were limited options

03:40.229 --> 03:41.712
at the airport gift shop.

03:41.796 --> 03:44.712
"Have a great flight",
so sweet.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.152
You're here in the flesh.

03:47.287 --> 03:49.545
Hm, I missed you so much.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.660
Um, who's babysitting
the turtles?

03:51.745 --> 03:53.376
Well, I am a part of a team
of 30

03:53.460 --> 03:55.248
so they let me take
the long weekend off.

03:55.447 --> 03:57.730
The long weekend?
It's Sunday, it's over.

03:57.815 --> 04:00.216
Yeah, I know, I was supposed
to get here yesterday morning

04:00.301 --> 04:02.283
but my first connecting
flight was delayed

04:02.368 --> 04:05.341
and then I got food poisoning
from some bad milk

04:05.426 --> 04:06.476
on my second connecting flight.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.996
Ew Ted, they made you drink
milk on the airplane?

04:09.081 --> 04:11.754
No I actually ordered it,
and in my defense,

04:11.839 --> 04:13.668
they were serving cookies, so.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.933
Okay, so um, how long do
we actually have then?

04:17.017 --> 04:18.880
Just today.

04:18.964 --> 04:20.055
Oh my God.

04:20.139 --> 04:22.144
Okay. Then enough about
the milk thing

04:22.228 --> 04:24.494
even though I have like
50 more questions about it.

04:24.578 --> 04:26.322
Yeah, yeah,
no need to milk it.

04:26.406 --> 04:28.585
Ooh, we definitely
don't have time for that.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.414
No I just, I just wanna be
with you and catch up and talk.

04:31.498 --> 04:33.741
Okay, so my parents are out
and David's at the store

04:33.826 --> 04:36.722
so maybe we can just like be
with each other right now,

04:36.807 --> 04:38.288
and then later if we feel
like it we can talk.

04:38.372 --> 04:39.379
- Yeah, but I...
- You're not still sick,

04:39.463 --> 04:40.819
- are you?
- No I just.

04:40.904 --> 04:41.892
Okay.

04:43.861 --> 04:45.515
Yeah. Okay, we can do this
first.

04:49.019 --> 04:52.206
Boy, I look at this place,
untouched from the 60s.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.296
These motels were a gold mine,
Roland,

04:54.381 --> 04:55.916
all they need is a little
dusting.

04:56.001 --> 04:58.775
And bleach, lots of bleach.

04:58.949 --> 05:00.500
You know, there are boutique
hotels

05:00.611 --> 05:03.052
that would kill for this level
of authenticity.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.607
I'm thinking of turning
this place

05:04.692 --> 05:06.610
into the Presidential Suite

05:06.695 --> 05:08.613
and charging a premium for it.

05:08.721 --> 05:11.291
I'm reminded John of Shanghai

05:11.669 --> 05:13.497
and our Party Secretary Suite

05:13.581 --> 05:15.151
with its own aquarium,

05:15.235 --> 05:18.859
I'd lay in a claw foot tub
watching the orcas.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.457
- Joc.
- And we're back.

05:20.542 --> 05:22.938
You know that staycation
we've been talking about?

05:23.142 --> 05:24.669
Why don't we just do that here?

05:24.754 --> 05:26.388
Well, Roland, that-that
sounds good,

05:26.473 --> 05:28.434
but uh, that just can't happen.

05:28.519 --> 05:30.339
As a new business owner
it's dangerous

05:30.424 --> 05:33.343
to treat your assets
as personal possessions.

05:33.427 --> 05:34.654
That's my John.

05:34.739 --> 05:37.433
At Rose Video, he made me
purchase the blue-ray

05:37.518 --> 05:40.916
of my gritty feminist police
drama, "Miranda Rights".

05:41.000 --> 05:42.787
I rented that three times.

05:42.871 --> 05:45.050
Miranda is so sassy
when she went undercover

05:45.134 --> 05:47.008
for that wet T-shirt contest.

05:47.104 --> 05:49.185
Hey, the sooner we get this
place guest ready,

05:49.269 --> 05:51.883
the sooner we can start
making a profit.

05:51.967 --> 05:54.103
Yeah. Well,
that sounds good to me.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.675
Bob's been charging us
a fortune to babysit.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.504
Speaking of which,
we should get going.

05:58.589 --> 06:01.160
Bob has his first cry therapy
session tonight.

06:01.455 --> 06:02.285
Okay.

06:02.369 --> 06:04.327
Bye.

06:05.938 --> 06:08.378
Well, if that isn't team work,
I don't know what is.

06:08.462 --> 06:11.076
Ah, I know, the room looks
pretty good, huh?

06:11.160 --> 06:13.426
No I'm, I'm talking about
the way you and I,

06:13.510 --> 06:15.080
threw them off the fragrance

06:15.164 --> 06:17.256
so that we could keep this
suite to ourselves.

06:17.340 --> 06:19.215
No that's not what
I was doing, Moira.

06:19.299 --> 06:21.477
No, it's very important
at this stage

06:21.562 --> 06:23.784
to keep the bar set very high
for Roland.

06:23.868 --> 06:25.460
- John.
- Now I just told them

06:25.545 --> 06:27.289
they couldn't stay here.

06:27.432 --> 06:28.915
Oh, be careful, John,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.574
lest you suffer vertigo
from the dizzying heights

06:31.659 --> 06:33.313
of your moral ground.

06:44.132 --> 06:46.214
Are you sure this is
what you want, David?

06:46.358 --> 06:48.126
This looks like someone
put a tarp over

06:48.211 --> 06:49.607
their living room furniture.

06:49.692 --> 06:52.228
Yeah, I'm going for an English
estate in the offseason.

06:52.313 --> 06:53.610
Okay, it's just uh,

06:53.694 --> 06:55.183
do you really want these photos
to say

06:55.268 --> 06:57.996
my relationship is an old
estate in the offseason?

06:58.468 --> 07:00.824
Why don't I show you
the county fair backdrop,

07:00.909 --> 07:05.003
I think a Ferris wheel would
look so cute on a mouse pad.

07:05.098 --> 07:06.929
I don't think we're gonna do
the mouse pads.

07:09.737 --> 07:11.745
- Oh hi.
- Hi.

07:11.830 --> 07:14.618
- Why do you look...?
- Hot?

07:14.811 --> 07:16.207
Oh, I got a spray tan.

07:16.292 --> 07:17.714
Patrick gave you his
appointment, didn't he?

07:17.798 --> 07:20.282
No, I just put mine on your
credit card.

07:20.367 --> 07:22.894
Okay, well that's fraud
and you're a criminal

07:22.979 --> 07:25.765
so where even is my life
partner?

07:25.887 --> 07:27.110
He's coming.

07:27.195 --> 07:31.591
I think he spent maybe a second
too long in there.

07:36.809 --> 07:39.417
Are you happy now, David?
Is this what you wanted?

07:39.689 --> 07:42.564
- You look...
- I look like a cheese puff.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.484
Okay, you said it, not me.

07:44.719 --> 07:46.724
Um what, uh, what ha,
what happened?

07:46.839 --> 07:48.831
Did they use the Allez Vous
bronzer on you?

07:48.916 --> 07:50.799
I don't know, David,
they asked me what I wanted,

07:50.883 --> 07:52.852
I told them just to give me
what you usually get.

07:52.937 --> 07:54.209
Well, why would you do that?

07:54.294 --> 07:56.518
I'm practically Sicilian,
you don't need that much sun.

07:56.602 --> 07:57.854
I don't know how it works,
David.

07:57.938 --> 07:59.682
Well, couldn't find it.

07:59.766 --> 08:03.611
Oh, hi Patrick, I almost
didn't recognize you,

08:03.696 --> 08:04.700
you look like one of those
people

08:04.784 --> 08:05.907
who has that skin condition

08:05.992 --> 08:07.019
from eating one too many
carrots.

08:07.103 --> 08:08.429
- Okay.
- You know what?

08:08.513 --> 08:10.475
I can't be in photos like this
so I'm going to uh,

08:10.559 --> 08:12.535
- I'm gonna go.
- No, no, no, no,

08:12.620 --> 08:14.480
we've got this all set up,

08:14.650 --> 08:16.579
- you'll barely notice it.
- Oh.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.429
And that's what photoshop's
for,

08:18.547 --> 08:19.982
- just to lighten it up a bit.
- Yes,

08:20.066 --> 08:21.391
just have fun with it.

08:21.476 --> 08:23.849
- Yes, have fun.
- Okay, Patrick,

08:23.934 --> 08:26.098
I'm gonna have to ask you
to smile a little more.

08:26.183 --> 08:27.759
I think this is probably
as good as it's gonna get

08:27.843 --> 08:29.320
- right now, Ray.
- Okay, okay, okay.

08:31.241 --> 08:32.855
Okay, here's what
I'm thinking,

08:33.059 --> 08:35.020
we do that like three
to four more times,

08:35.105 --> 08:37.197
and then we go on a romantic
walk to your house

08:37.280 --> 08:39.938
and we like hang out there
for a little bit.

08:40.118 --> 08:43.442
Yeah um, that plan sounds
really active, Alexis.

08:43.527 --> 08:45.157
- Mhmm.
- But uh my mom's staying

08:45.242 --> 08:46.467
at my place and uh,

08:46.551 --> 08:49.877
I'd rather not walk in on her
and her zumba instructor,

08:49.962 --> 08:53.314
don't wanna have to zoom
back here.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.451
Is everything okay?

08:55.976 --> 08:57.783
It's okay to admit
that I tuckered you out.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.003
No it's, it's not that.

09:00.087 --> 09:01.874
Okay, then what is it?

09:01.958 --> 09:04.703
I just thought that it was
important

09:04.865 --> 09:06.780
that we have this conversation
in person.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.381
You're starting to sound like
me trying to end things

09:09.465 --> 09:12.123
with B-Rock on the Backstreet
Boys Millennium Tour.

09:12.962 --> 09:14.895
Ted, you're not like trying
to break up with me, are you?

09:14.979 --> 09:16.371
No I'm not breaking up
with you.

09:16.456 --> 09:19.565
Oh okay, thank God.
So what is it?

09:20.209 --> 09:21.779
I got offered a job.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.554
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

09:24.655 --> 09:27.668
- Is it a bad job?
- No it's a great job,

09:28.378 --> 09:30.721
they wanna make me a permanent
part of the research team

09:30.900 --> 09:32.902
in the Galapagos.

09:34.431 --> 09:36.566
Okay, define permanent.

09:37.146 --> 09:38.895
It's a three year contract.

09:39.837 --> 09:41.842
Okay, that's a long time.

09:41.927 --> 09:44.029
Yeah, I just,
I keep waiting for things

09:44.114 --> 09:45.875
to get easier for us.

09:46.275 --> 09:48.747
So um, what are you gonna
tell them?

09:48.936 --> 09:50.105
I, I don't know,

09:50.190 --> 09:54.224
I mean I had three plane rides
to think about it and,

09:54.309 --> 09:56.233
and I wanted to have a solution
by the time I got here,

09:56.317 --> 09:58.754
but seeing you,

10:00.060 --> 10:01.463
I don't wanna lose this.

10:02.845 --> 10:05.024
Okay, so what do we,
what do we do?

10:05.108 --> 10:07.461
Do I like move to
the Galapagos?

10:07.690 --> 10:09.594
Or I move back here.

10:09.835 --> 10:11.711
And turn down your dream job.

10:13.942 --> 10:16.342
Okay, this just got like
very heavy.

10:17.210 --> 10:19.243
I feel like I'm sweating,

10:19.328 --> 10:21.205
I also feel like very cold.

10:21.290 --> 10:23.347
Yeah. I, I took the weekend
because I want us to have

10:23.431 --> 10:25.513
a few days to talk about it,
but then...

10:25.598 --> 10:27.267
Yeah, no, the milk, I know.

10:28.953 --> 10:31.567
Um, Ted, I think I'm gonna need
a minute.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.096
You know that I can't make big
decisions under pressure,

10:34.180 --> 10:36.674
that's how I ended up
with a pixie cut at prom.

10:38.378 --> 10:40.685
There has to be a way
through this.

10:42.198 --> 10:45.269
I liked this a whole lot more
before we started talking.

10:53.963 --> 10:55.577
Moira, what's going on
in there?

10:55.662 --> 10:58.501
Oh! It's my hands, John,
it's the water,

10:58.586 --> 11:00.153
it's freezing cold.

11:00.238 --> 11:02.019
Well, then move your hands.

11:02.103 --> 11:03.542
How will I know
if it's getting warmer

11:03.626 --> 11:05.414
if I'm not touching it?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.829
Well Moira, you've got
the cold tap on,

11:07.914 --> 11:10.419
you've gotta balance it
with the hot.

11:10.615 --> 11:11.745
Oh.

11:12.108 --> 11:14.635
Well, I'm sorry I'm not an
alchemist, John,

11:14.746 --> 11:16.512
and it's not like there's
a his sink

11:16.597 --> 11:18.427
for when the hers
is inoperable.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.602
Okay, Moira.

11:19.687 --> 11:22.261
Excuse me while I try
to pass through.

11:22.372 --> 11:24.624
Oh John, these door frames,

11:24.709 --> 11:26.615
it's like trying
to force oneself

11:26.700 --> 11:28.372
through the eye of a needle.

11:30.078 --> 11:33.012
I think uh, the point's been
made, Moira.

11:33.097 --> 11:36.928
Oh, so you're willing to
reconsider a room upgrade?

11:37.013 --> 11:38.496
- Upgrade?
- Mhmm.

11:38.581 --> 11:39.804
Oh, I thought you were
talking about

11:39.888 --> 11:41.414
a romantic weekend.

11:41.587 --> 11:44.174
We start with a weekend
and go from there.

11:44.349 --> 11:46.830
You don't believe we deserve
this perquisite, John,

11:47.062 --> 11:49.894
at least until we secure
a way out of here.

11:50.089 --> 11:52.535
Moira, yeah,
the room is bigger,

11:52.620 --> 11:55.196
it might even be nicer,
but haven't we managed

11:55.281 --> 11:58.200
to make due here in this room
over the past few years?

11:58.285 --> 12:01.074
Yes, in the same way road
crustations are known

12:01.159 --> 12:03.512
to make due in old soda cans.

12:03.678 --> 12:04.972
And what about the kids?

12:05.057 --> 12:06.844
We're just going
to abandon them here?

12:06.929 --> 12:08.804
They're practically
middle-aged

12:08.889 --> 12:11.019
and they're not denying
theirselves betterment,

12:11.104 --> 12:13.848
why should we?

12:14.290 --> 12:17.652
Alright, maybe it is good
business practice

12:17.737 --> 12:20.024
to sample the product
before selling.

12:20.188 --> 12:22.411
Well, whatever you think
is best, Mr. Rose.

12:22.679 --> 12:25.364
I've packed your weekender,
it's in the car.

12:29.890 --> 12:33.868
See, these are good,
we could use any of these.

12:33.953 --> 12:35.472
David, those are just ones
where you look good.

12:35.556 --> 12:36.787
Well...

12:37.024 --> 12:39.731
only took me nine showers
to still look like this.

12:39.816 --> 12:41.212
See, this is good,

12:41.296 --> 12:42.805
this is how you were
supposed to look.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.955
Oh, well then if that's
all it took

12:45.039 --> 12:46.118
should we just head
back to Ray's?

12:46.202 --> 12:47.445
I don't know,
do you think he'd have time?

12:47.529 --> 12:49.404
No, I was being very,
very sarcastic.

12:50.044 --> 12:51.875
- Oh.
- Are there any usable shots?

12:51.959 --> 12:53.442
- Umm.
- Umm.

12:53.526 --> 12:55.694
None of the ones where you
can see your face or hands,

12:55.779 --> 12:58.011
- There's a few I think that...
- but we're still looking.

12:58.095 --> 12:59.622
- Might be good.
- Cool,

12:59.706 --> 13:01.276
so I guess my relatives
will just have to imagine

13:01.360 --> 13:03.147
what the person I'm marrying
looks like

13:03.231 --> 13:05.062
and how happy I am to be
with him, and...

13:05.146 --> 13:07.020
Okay fine, ooh,

13:07.104 --> 13:09.284
maybe we just open up
the guest list a bit

13:09.368 --> 13:12.069
and invite a few more
of your distant relatives,

13:12.153 --> 13:14.158
or I do have head shots
from my pageant days

13:14.242 --> 13:15.812
that I could mail out to them.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.510
David, can we just agree
to stop making this wedding

13:18.594 --> 13:20.019
a bigger deal than it needs
to be.

13:20.104 --> 13:21.814
We are not these people.
Okay.

13:21.899 --> 13:24.905
Well, this is a teachable
moment for all of us.

13:25.427 --> 13:28.172
You know, look at his tan,
looks great,

13:28.256 --> 13:29.347
the lighting's right,

13:29.432 --> 13:32.351
maybe Stevie should take
a few candid shots

13:32.521 --> 13:35.179
- and see what happens.
- You're insane.

13:35.263 --> 13:37.094
- David... no.
- No I'm not.

13:37.178 --> 13:39.401
We are looking for photos
and here we are.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.270
Oh my God.

13:41.817 --> 13:44.318
Okay, well the tan
does look good.

13:44.403 --> 13:46.235
- Ooh see.
- Okay fine,

13:46.320 --> 13:48.064
like maybe a couple more
but then that's it.

13:48.149 --> 13:49.371
Okay fine, alright.

13:51.192 --> 13:52.849
- What is your hand?
- Oh that's weird.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.416
Huh?

13:58.589 --> 14:01.153
Hey Alexis, I haven't seen
you running in a while.

14:01.238 --> 14:02.138
Thanks, Twy.

14:02.223 --> 14:04.656
Yeah, I just needed to get out
and clear my head.

14:05.121 --> 14:06.602
Is everything okay?

14:06.947 --> 14:08.240
I don't know.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.547
Okay, do you think
a smoothie might help?

14:10.994 --> 14:12.874
No, I think I'll just
take a smoothie.

14:13.377 --> 14:17.059
Okay, I'll just be right
over there if you need me.

14:21.842 --> 14:22.859
Oh hi,

14:24.287 --> 14:25.370
Ted.

14:25.455 --> 14:26.564
Um... Alexis.

14:26.649 --> 14:29.624
I know, without sounding
too forward,

14:29.709 --> 14:31.729
I've seen you around...

14:31.814 --> 14:33.993
And uh, you know,
I have to say,

14:34.077 --> 14:36.178
I think that you are the most
beautiful girl

14:36.263 --> 14:37.471
this town's ever seen.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.664
Alexis, Alexis,

14:42.205 --> 14:43.524
here's your smoothie.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.643
Twy, do you ever have those
days where you wonder

14:48.728 --> 14:50.093
why things just
can't be easier?

14:50.734 --> 14:52.430
Why, what's going on?

14:53.011 --> 14:54.650
Ted got a job.

14:54.735 --> 14:56.657
- Another one?
- No, the same one.

14:56.752 --> 14:59.280
He got offered the same job
he already has?

14:59.365 --> 15:03.276
No, same job, they just
want him to stay longer,

15:04.045 --> 15:05.682
like forever.

15:06.350 --> 15:07.799
Oh.

15:07.884 --> 15:11.947
Yeah, so it's like
what now?

15:12.246 --> 15:14.643
Do I leave everything behind

15:14.728 --> 15:16.403
and move to some random island

15:16.488 --> 15:18.039
to be with the love of my life?

15:18.499 --> 15:20.303
'Cause I did that with Harry
Styles in England,

15:20.387 --> 15:22.531
it was like too rainy.

15:23.586 --> 15:25.060
That is hard.

15:25.995 --> 15:28.486
I feel like now's the point
where you... normally

15:28.571 --> 15:31.081
have some surprisingly
helpful advice.

15:32.123 --> 15:33.768
I know you, Alexis,

15:33.853 --> 15:36.503
and you always make
the right decision.

15:36.588 --> 15:39.175
- Hm.
- Eventually.

15:41.893 --> 15:43.115
Thanks, Twy.

16:01.809 --> 16:04.590
There he is,
my ginchi hotelier.

16:04.675 --> 16:06.419
How does it feel
to be President

16:06.503 --> 16:08.135
in the Presidential Suite?

16:08.270 --> 16:09.448
Well, uh,

16:09.635 --> 16:12.206
let me say this
about that, Moira,

16:12.291 --> 16:14.993
Uh, if not now, when,

16:15.078 --> 16:17.341
if not us, who.

16:17.514 --> 16:20.433
- Are you alright, John?
- Oh, it's my JFK,

16:20.543 --> 16:22.087
just playing into the theme.

16:22.171 --> 16:25.742
Best to leave the voice work
to me when setting a mood.

16:32.398 --> 16:34.313
Yeah, so I must admit,
Sweetheart,

16:35.081 --> 16:36.997
I could get used to this.

16:37.185 --> 16:39.357
I'm going to run a bath,
John.

16:39.905 --> 16:42.324
Well, if I close my eyes
I can almost hear

16:42.408 --> 16:44.500
the orcas calling to be fed

16:44.584 --> 16:46.064
or freed.

16:47.143 --> 16:49.817
- Oh.
- Jocelyn, Roland.

16:49.902 --> 16:53.166
Johnny, Moira.

16:53.289 --> 16:54.400
What's going on here?

16:54.485 --> 16:56.098
Uh, nothing, nothing.

16:56.248 --> 16:57.771
No we were uh,

16:58.218 --> 17:00.049
just uh,

17:00.134 --> 17:02.966
Doing a final polish
on the uh, on the room.

17:03.051 --> 17:04.621
Uh-huh.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.997
Oh, I guess martinis work
better than wax, huh?

17:08.082 --> 17:11.047
Johnny, wasn't it you who said

17:11.132 --> 17:13.223
it was dangerous to treat
your assets

17:13.308 --> 17:14.603
like personal possessions?

17:14.688 --> 17:17.651
And what may I ask are you
two doing back here?

17:17.736 --> 17:20.022
I told you we would
get caught, Roly.

17:20.108 --> 17:21.270
Well...

17:21.355 --> 17:22.429
if you must know,

17:22.513 --> 17:25.867
Jocelyn and I had been renting
our extra bedroom

17:26.009 --> 17:28.536
to uh, help pay for this place.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.672
Yeah, and so we thought
there's nobody here,

17:30.804 --> 17:32.548
it might be nice
to have a weekend

17:32.632 --> 17:34.942
where a total stranger
wasn't making themselves

17:35.026 --> 17:36.335
at home in my kitchen.

17:36.419 --> 17:37.556
Okay, look Roland,

17:37.641 --> 17:41.513
I may have been a bit too much
of a stickler earlier.

17:41.598 --> 17:44.473
Ah no, no it's fine,
Johnny, we'll just uh,

17:44.557 --> 17:46.388
we'll just sleep in the truck
with the baby.

17:46.472 --> 17:48.173
Or you know what,

17:48.257 --> 17:50.349
you could give us the keys
to your place,

17:50.530 --> 17:52.046
it would be like wife swap

17:52.130 --> 17:53.656
except we wouldn't be swapping
wives,

17:53.740 --> 17:56.529
- we'd be swapping mattresses.
- Okay, you can take the room.

17:56.613 --> 17:57.451
It's not gonna happen.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.893
- Oh thank you, guys.
- Okay. Great, thank you.

17:59.978 --> 18:02.418
I've never stayed in
a Presidential Suite.

18:02.503 --> 18:03.710
Enjoy it, Honey,

18:03.794 --> 18:05.731
this one uh reminds me
a lot of the uh,

18:05.816 --> 18:08.703
suites in uh Cuba
before Castro took over.

18:08.835 --> 18:11.417
- That's not, that's not JFK.
- Yes, it's JFK,

18:11.502 --> 18:13.629
- Ask a not what your country
- he's always...

18:13.714 --> 18:15.153
- can do for you.
- Who said that?

18:15.240 --> 18:17.428
- The man's from Boston.
- <i>John!</i> - He didn't say, no he's not,

18:17.512 --> 18:19.232
- he's from Upstate New York.
- Coming Moira

18:19.330 --> 18:20.948
And FDR said that.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.721
What is all this?

18:35.157 --> 18:36.463
Sit.

18:45.429 --> 18:47.822
Did you close down
the whole café?

18:48.019 --> 18:49.772
More like I politely
but forcefully

18:49.857 --> 18:51.903
asked everyone to leave.

18:52.213 --> 18:54.780
So the set menu for tonight

18:54.873 --> 18:57.460
is mozzarella sticks,
four cheese lasagne,

18:57.545 --> 18:59.312
and a blueberry cheesecake
for dessert.

18:59.949 --> 19:00.949
Huh,

19:02.489 --> 19:03.972
that's a lot of dairy.

19:04.056 --> 19:06.444
All of your cheat day
favourites.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.780
Also, I may have forgotten
about the whole milk situation.

19:09.865 --> 19:12.593
Well, I appreciate
the gesture, Alexis.

19:14.334 --> 19:17.158
So I feel like there's
an elephant in the room

19:17.251 --> 19:20.438
and... I skipped the class
that taught us how to...

19:20.565 --> 19:21.684
..care for large mammals

19:21.769 --> 19:23.329
and I don't know how
to get it to leave.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.814
You can't move back here,
Ted,

19:27.034 --> 19:28.946
you've just been offered
the job of your dreams

19:29.081 --> 19:30.821
and there's no turning back now.

19:31.497 --> 19:34.262
And just think of all those
gross little flies

19:34.347 --> 19:36.890
that are still out there
for you to discover.

19:37.099 --> 19:39.860
Actually, those flies are an
invaluable piece of the puzzle

19:39.945 --> 19:41.143
in the study of evolution,

19:41.228 --> 19:44.660
but... yes we do have our fingers
crossed that there are

19:44.807 --> 19:46.766
still a few more out there.

19:48.634 --> 19:50.421
What about you,

19:50.718 --> 19:51.850
what are you gonna do?

19:53.140 --> 19:55.327
This might come as a shock
to you, Ted,

19:55.412 --> 19:58.342
but I can't move
to the Galapagos.

19:58.905 --> 20:00.597
I wouldn't let you even
if you tried.

20:01.504 --> 20:04.292
You're building something
special here, Alexis,

20:04.377 --> 20:06.379
and you deserve to see
where it takes you.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.386
I'm so proud of you.

20:10.911 --> 20:12.298
I'm so proud of you.

20:13.674 --> 20:16.241
I'd like to think that 
we helped each other get here.

20:17.207 --> 20:18.561
I know that we did.

20:18.725 --> 20:20.857
And when you get on
that plane tomorrow

20:22.560 --> 20:24.612
I want you to know
how grateful I am

20:24.697 --> 20:26.093
to have met you.

20:26.186 --> 20:27.626
I don't think I'm ever gonna
meet another woman

20:27.710 --> 20:29.541
who made me feel the way
that you do.

20:31.471 --> 20:33.323
I'm sure there'll be like

20:34.070 --> 20:35.634
some other woman,

20:36.477 --> 20:37.867
somewhere.

20:40.895 --> 20:42.680
Can't say that we didn't try.

20:44.349 --> 20:45.907
I love you, Ted.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.307
I love you too.
