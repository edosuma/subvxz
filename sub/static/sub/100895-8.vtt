00:17.642 --> 00:20.270
<i>I believe some folks</i>
<i>on this train forget</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:25.066
<i>just how generous and wonderful a man</i>
<i>Mr. Wilford actually is. </i>

00:26.317 --> 00:27.318
<i>Not me.</i>

00:28.820 --> 00:29.988
<i>I could never forget.</i>

00:30.613 --> 00:33.199
<i>It's Wilford who runs our sacred Engine. </i>

00:34.409 --> 00:37.037
<i>It's Wilford who has</i>
<i>his finger on our pulse,</i>

00:37.120 --> 00:38.747
<i>who knows exactly what we need,</i>

00:38.830 --> 00:41.166
<i>how much food and water,</i>
<i>how much heat and space,</i>

00:41.249 --> 00:42.584
<i>how much discipline.</i>

00:43.376 --> 00:46.379
<i>It's Wilford who saved us</i>
<i>from the bitter cold.</i>

00:47.797 --> 00:49.966
<i>He's the only reason we're alive.</i>

00:52.218 --> 00:56.055
<i>Yet, somehow,</i>
<i>on this train we all call home,</i>

00:56.639 --> 01:00.935
<i>there are passengers</i>
<i>who see fit to challenge him.</i>

01:02.812 --> 01:05.231
<i>Passengers who think they know better.</i>

01:06.524 --> 01:10.737
<i>Passengers who take for granted</i>
<i>this great miracle that he's given us.</i>

01:40.850 --> 01:42.227
Password?

01:42.310 --> 01:43.686
Eat the rich.

01:44.270 --> 01:45.647
Take off your shoes.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.106
And keep quiet.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.485
Layton didn't tell me
I'd be meeting a kid.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.445
On the right.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.412
Wait. What are you doing?
Stop. Don't go there.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.042
Get back here.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.794
Stop.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.799
Hurry up. Come on.

03:03.182 --> 03:04.183
Holy shit.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.687
Quiet.
They can hear us.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.272
There's no Wilford
up here at all.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.899
-There's...

03:10.982 --> 03:12.233
There's no Wilford up here at all.

03:26.205 --> 03:27.165
Stop.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.379
Melanie is running the whole thing.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.887
Layton wanted you
to see it for yourself.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.307
They're gonna tear her apart.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.186
Now you can go.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.826
<i>One day,</i>
<i>I know I'll see Mr. Wilford again,</i>

04:04.911 --> 04:08.623
<i>and when I do, I will thank him</i>
<i>from the bottom of my heart</i>

04:08.706 --> 04:10.124
<i>for everything that he's done.</i>

04:10.959 --> 04:11.960
<i>For me.</i>

04:13.253 --> 04:14.420
<i>For all of us.</i>

04:15.171 --> 04:21.052
<i>These are his revolutions,</i>
<i>1,001 cars long.</i>

04:45.076 --> 04:46.119
Watch it.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.997
Jacks are coming through.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.126
Move. Get out of here.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.299
That's it, move.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.052
Back it up now.

05:19.610 --> 05:23.448
Tail car, subtrain, Nightcar.

05:24.907 --> 05:25.950
Right, this is it.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.370
Everything hinges on us meeting
the Jackboots midtrain, right here.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.749
We hit 'em with overwhelming strength
on our turf.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.168
The lights just flashed
in the Folgers' car.

05:35.251 --> 05:39.881
LJ made it to the Engine.
All right. This is it. Let's get ready.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.716
Good luck, everyone.

05:41.799 --> 05:42.800
Stay safe.

05:44.927 --> 05:48.765
Layton. I can't say which side
the Brakemen are gonna land.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.308
You know how stubborn Roche is.

05:50.892 --> 05:55.229
None of us want a fight with the Brakemen,
but there are gonna be casualties today.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.362
Hi.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.156
Where have you been?

06:05.698 --> 06:09.994
Look. I can't explain. I just need you
to stay out of Third today, okay?

06:10.078 --> 06:11.079
Why?

06:12.330 --> 06:15.083
What did you do, Bess?
Is this about Layton?

06:15.666 --> 06:18.461
Just stay home. Please.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.089
I asked you point blank
whether you were helping him,

06:21.172 --> 06:23.257
and you lied to my face?

06:24.258 --> 06:25.510
Jinju...

06:28.930 --> 06:31.724
why did you ask me
to steer clear of Melanie Cavill?

06:31.808 --> 06:33.893
Because you're messing with things
that you don't understand.

06:33.976 --> 06:34.977
What things?

06:38.606 --> 06:41.692
You knew she put Layton in a drawer,
didn't you?

06:44.195 --> 06:49.158
-You're protecting her.
-I was protecting you, Bess. You.

06:51.494 --> 06:55.331
Did you also know
she tortured a Tailie to death?

06:58.918 --> 07:00.002
I wonder, Jinju,

07:00.086 --> 07:03.589
just how many deep, dark secrets
about this train you really do know.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.971
Please don't make me choose
between you and the train.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.433
Stay in here today.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.491
Morning, Robert. You wanted
to discuss the anniversary celebrations?

07:30.575 --> 07:31.701
Please, come in, Ruth.

07:34.036 --> 07:35.288
Commander Grey.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.125
What's going on?

07:39.208 --> 07:40.293
Ruth...

07:42.086 --> 07:46.174
if there's anything you need to tell us,
best you do it now.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.011
Anything like what?

07:50.094 --> 07:53.723
Ruth, we've heard a rather
disturbing account from the Engine.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.309
Oh, no. What's going on?

08:00.897 --> 08:05.193
We've been told, reliably,
that Mr. Wilford is not in the Engine

08:06.611 --> 08:08.529
nor anywhere else on this train.

08:09.697 --> 08:14.577
There's evidence that Melanie Cavill
is running <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

08:18.581 --> 08:21.334
Are you having a go at me? Hmm?

08:21.417 --> 08:24.170
Embarrassing me in the Aquarium
wasn't enough for you?

08:24.253 --> 08:26.214
- Ruthie, it's--
-You lost your mind, Nolan?

08:27.507 --> 08:30.009
You know that Wilford's in the Engine.
You've seen him.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.427
You've shaken the man's hand.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.096
Not since departure, I haven't.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.100
We simply need to know if this is true.

08:39.268 --> 08:43.314
Because if it is, someone needs
to assert governance of this train.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.443
Someone like you, Lilah?

08:47.527 --> 08:51.572
Ruth, why don't you gather
the First Class committee?

08:52.156 --> 08:53.783
We'll get to the bottom of this.

09:03.292 --> 09:07.171
This is Chicago, and we should be there
in a day and a half.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.966
This is our slowest revolution, isn't it?

09:11.634 --> 09:13.135
Twenty-two hours off average?

09:13.678 --> 09:16.013
We lose a little bit of time
each revolution.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.724
So it's on us to reverse that.

09:20.434 --> 09:23.396
Because if <i>Snowpiercer</i> stops, we all die.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.148
That's right.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.320
-Melanie?
-Mmm-hmm?

09:33.281 --> 09:34.740
What was your daughter like?

09:43.291 --> 09:45.251
She was...

09:46.877 --> 09:47.878
smart.

09:49.171 --> 09:50.214
Like you.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.428
Sweet.

09:57.179 --> 09:58.639
Much nicer than me.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.018
What happened to her?

10:03.853 --> 10:05.688
She was with my parents at the end.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.234
Allie was supposed to get
on the train with them,

10:11.068 --> 10:12.153
but...

10:13.946 --> 10:15.072
didn't make it.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.037
My parents didn't make it, either.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.372
But I have my Tail mom, Josie.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.546
Mel, you're needed in First, urgently.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.509
Okay, you're on lookout.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.721
If you see anything, tell Javi or Bennett.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.348
Okay.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.666
Excuse me.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.379
Is there a problem?

11:11.462 --> 11:13.964
Something rather incendiary
that we need cleared up.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.259
What is it?

11:18.594 --> 11:23.265
There's been a report
that Mr. Wilford is not aboard the train.

11:28.229 --> 11:31.273
Well, that's ridiculous.
I met with him last night.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.902
Well, I'm afraid we need
Mr. Wilford to prove it himself.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.282
In person.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.453
All right.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.249
Well, I'll get the phone
and, Lilah, you can talk to him yourself.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.878
That isn't going to work
this time, Melanie.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.384
We know you're running <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

11:59.510 --> 12:02.805
We have an eyewitness account.
Direct from the Engine.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.643
From whom?

12:10.146 --> 12:11.355
Choo-choo.

12:16.277 --> 12:19.530
Seriously?
You're listening to her?

12:19.613 --> 12:21.198
It's not what I was expecting.

12:21.282 --> 12:24.368
The Engine, not eternal at all.

12:25.286 --> 12:30.332
More like a rat's nest
held together with rubber bands and wires.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.501
And why should anyone believe you, LJ?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.211
Exactly. She's a psycho,
and we're putting--

12:34.295 --> 12:35.713
-You have no right to say that.
-We're putting...

12:38.090 --> 12:40.176
-Let her talk.
-I saw her quarters.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.928
I saw her books, her maps,

12:43.012 --> 12:46.807
and even this photo
of her poor, dead daughter.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.977
-No Mr. Wilford, though!
-Let me go!

12:50.060 --> 12:51.187
- Calm down, everybody.
-Let me go!

12:51.270 --> 12:52.396
-Hey!
-Back off!

13:00.696 --> 13:01.989
He's got a gun!

13:09.205 --> 13:10.623
Call all available units.

13:10.706 --> 13:13.751
Commander, you can't.
We need those units downtrain.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.794
I don't take orders from you anymore.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.091
Tail station.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.177
- ...bullet down in the Chains?
- I am.

13:23.260 --> 13:26.055
Roger that. Got a 10-10 up in First.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.603
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.234
Double up patrols.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.781
Come back again soon, boys.

13:49.787 --> 13:50.788
Do it.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.585
The Jackboots are headed uptrain.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.006
You ready for this?

14:02.716 --> 14:03.926
No going back now.

14:05.427 --> 14:06.637
Send out the signal.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.107
Sorry, I must get going.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.075
Looks good.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.788
Guys, we're running out of scrap.

14:33.581 --> 14:36.500
If we ration the water, maybe we can
strip a couple water barrels down.

14:37.334 --> 14:41.255
We're all in now. Do it.
We need everything we have for weapons.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.257
Excuse me, guys. Coming through.

14:46.093 --> 14:47.219
I got a message.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.979
<i>Revolución.</i>

15:01.442 --> 15:02.610
We go today.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.363
Spread the word.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.532
Prisoner coming through.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.204
Nice work, Brakeman.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.206
I don't wanna rough you up
unless I have to.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.250
Read my lips.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.921
Until further notice,
you're all confined to quarters.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.380
Excuse me?

15:23.464 --> 15:25.507
You don't have the authority to do that.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.259
Shut your mouth, boyo.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.678
Lock her up.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.431
You're making a mistake.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.309
Ruth, it's a mistake!

15:37.353 --> 15:39.063
Nolan,
what if we're wrong about this?

15:39.146 --> 15:41.565
What if Wilford is in the Engine?
This is mutiny.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.776
Then we need to see for ourselves, Ruthie.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.612
You and I, to the Engine.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.289
Happy Halloween. Make it fast.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.506
I feel like a dead-set wanker in this.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.510
-Big John, this is Jakes.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.555
These are Layton's best Tailies?

16:13.639 --> 16:15.307
Hey, same side now.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.686
Take John down. His people
will bring the parts you need.

16:19.603 --> 16:20.479
Lights, you stick with me.

16:21.939 --> 16:22.940
Where's my guy?

16:23.607 --> 16:24.775
I'm right here.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.445
Oh, strewth.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.036
Shall we?

16:45.421 --> 16:49.258
Tyson, you know
these aren't lawful orders.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.220
Sit down.

16:55.556 --> 17:00.185
That photo that they took of my daughter,
I have another one in the booth.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.270
Will you let me get it?

17:02.021 --> 17:04.064
-Can't do that.
-It's just...

17:05.315 --> 17:09.236
If something happens to me,
I want her close.

17:12.489 --> 17:13.365
Quickly.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.336
Mel wants us
to lock down the Engine?

17:26.420 --> 17:28.922
-What would you lock down for?
- Why don't you tell us, kid?

17:29.006 --> 17:30.799
Two days here,
and we're already into lockdown?

17:32.676 --> 17:34.970
What the fuck was that? Hit the door.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.143
Ben... Ben, they're gonna kill us.
It's over.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.269
Lock it down, Javi!

17:42.352 --> 17:43.604
Why don't we open the door,
tell 'em the truth?

17:43.687 --> 17:44.730
-They need us.
-Do it now!

17:44.813 --> 17:45.898
- Come on!
-Now!

17:58.535 --> 17:59.369
Go!

18:02.581 --> 18:04.541
-What did you do?
-I had to.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.627
-What did you do?
-I'm sorry.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.174
No, no, no! Ben! Ben.
Ben, Ben, Ben, please!

18:15.135 --> 18:16.136
Shit.

18:19.681 --> 18:20.516
Grab him!

18:21.183 --> 18:22.851
All right, all right, all right.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.228
Where is Wilford?

18:27.564 --> 18:28.565
He's dead.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.193
Cuff him.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.781
He's been dead since departure.

18:36.406 --> 18:37.407
Melanie took the train.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.827
I had nothing to do with it.
You have to believe me.

18:41.870 --> 18:42.871
I'm sorry.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.412
Take him away.

19:35.465 --> 19:36.884
-You all right?

19:40.262 --> 19:41.805
Wilford is dead, Nolan.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.227
He's been dead for years,

19:48.437 --> 19:49.980
and no one even knew.

19:53.317 --> 19:56.612
All that time... How did I not know?

19:58.363 --> 20:01.283
And what is this? I mean...

20:03.785 --> 20:05.120
what is all of this?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.708
She deceived us all, Ruth.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.961
What will people hold on to now?

20:28.644 --> 20:33.523
You. Me. Order.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.402
I want her to pay, Nolan.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.033
I want her to pay.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.477
So why are we
doubling up on patrols?

21:10.560 --> 21:12.104
I don't know,
but it better be something good.

21:12.187 --> 21:13.105
Walter.

21:13.689 --> 21:14.648
You're late.

21:14.731 --> 21:15.983
This is Lights.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.527
She's with you.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.669
You finally caught the rat.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.884
What? He was resisting, wasn't he?

21:42.968 --> 21:44.469
Just open the doors.

21:45.595 --> 21:47.264
I gotta check this uptrain.

21:51.643 --> 21:52.728
Here it is. Rear comms.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.062
No, no. No, no, no.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.481
You gotta look for 50 over 125.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.442
-There is no 50 over 125.
-50 over 125.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.991
This is Jefferson in Tail station.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.909
We don't have time for this.
I'm just gonna pull it.

22:09.036 --> 22:09.911
What the--

22:12.789 --> 22:13.790
Asshole.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.058
Weapons up.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.823
- Wait a minute.
- Layton.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.087
Hey.
Nice day for a walk, Mr. Riggs?

23:00.170 --> 23:03.465
Yes, it is, son. Let's make it a long one.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.177
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Why is she here?

23:10.013 --> 23:12.015
Okay, hey, hey, hey. Listen up.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.352
Till is one of us now.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.653
Look, I know you all got trust issues.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.072
I got 'em, too.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.408
The people uptrain...

23:31.284 --> 23:33.912
shoved us down here
in the dark to fend for ourselves.

23:33.995 --> 23:36.873
- Yeah, we know.
-We learned how to survive in the shadows.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.416
Yeah!

23:40.836 --> 23:41.962
Well, today...

23:43.171 --> 23:44.881
What? What? Come on.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.134
Today, let's leave this hell behind!

23:47.217 --> 23:48.677
-Yeah!
-Yes!

23:49.553 --> 23:53.181
We will fight with everything we got.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.266
Yeah!

23:54.349 --> 23:57.060
Because out there,
right outside that door,

23:57.144 --> 24:00.230
there is a future
that does not include us.

24:00.313 --> 24:01.940
- Yeah!
- It will.

24:02.816 --> 24:05.944
Today, we take this train,
and we remind them

24:06.027 --> 24:08.488
exactly who it is
that they locked up back here!

24:08.572 --> 24:10.073
Yeah!

24:11.158 --> 24:13.034
Today, we march for Josie.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.077
For Josie!

24:14.161 --> 24:16.580
-For Suzanne!
- For Suzanne!

24:16.663 --> 24:19.040
For Suzanne! For Old Ivan!

24:19.124 --> 24:20.083
For Old Ivan!

24:20.167 --> 24:24.880
For everyone that we have lost
to hunger and to sickness,

24:24.963 --> 24:27.174
to all the failed rebellions.

24:28.341 --> 24:31.595
We got people who are willing
to lay down their lives for us,

24:31.678 --> 24:34.222
because they believe, like we know,

24:34.306 --> 24:39.227
that it is time for this train
to work for all of its passengers!

24:47.402 --> 24:51.865
Today, we march to the Engine!

24:52.866 --> 24:54.784
One Tail!

24:54.868 --> 24:55.869
No.

25:00.582 --> 25:01.625
One Train.

25:01.708 --> 25:02.959
One Train!

25:03.043 --> 25:08.089
-One Train. One Train. One Train.
- One Train! One Train! One Train!

25:25.774 --> 25:28.735
All right, let's go, fast as you can.
Big John's waiting.

25:28.818 --> 25:31.780
One Train! One Train!

25:40.830 --> 25:44.292
Oh! Walter! What are you up to?

25:44.376 --> 25:48.505
I'm... I'm back in Electrics,
and she was showing me a few things.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.343
No shit. She's a Tailie.

25:53.426 --> 25:55.136
- No. Hey. Hey--
-Hey, call forward.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.472
Tell Commander Grey
to get his Jackboots back here fast.

25:57.555 --> 25:58.807
Get off me!

25:58.890 --> 26:00.934
Osweiller, the line's dead.

26:01.017 --> 26:02.435
What the hell are you up to?

26:02.519 --> 26:04.354
All right, go on foot. Go now.

26:09.859 --> 26:12.696
This is a very important promise
Layton needs to keep.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.407
You understand that, don't you, Murray?

26:16.908 --> 26:17.909
Yeah, they're my mates.

26:19.661 --> 26:21.538
No one's called me Murray in ages.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.750
Henry, this is Murray.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.168
He doesn't look like a Tailie.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.920
Well, you don't look like
much of a doctor.

26:29.587 --> 26:31.631
Are you ready? I'm gonna need your help.

26:31.715 --> 26:32.716
Yeah.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.555
Oh, Christ Almighty.

26:39.597 --> 26:42.559
I'm proud of you, Henry.
I knew you'd do the right thing.

26:42.642 --> 26:44.477
Thank you. It's about time.

26:44.561 --> 26:45.812
Go on, then.

26:51.192 --> 26:54.738
Strong Boy, you ugly bugger.

26:57.490 --> 27:01.328
The passengers need to be told the news
from the three of us first.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.663
Let them know immediately
who is in charge.

27:04.372 --> 27:05.915
-I'll get it.

27:09.294 --> 27:12.505
Commander! Commander,
there's trouble downtrain.

27:12.589 --> 27:15.633
-Comms are down and there are Tailies out.
-The Tailies?

27:15.717 --> 27:18.720
While we squabble over Wilford up here.
That's no bloody coincidence.

27:19.346 --> 27:23.099
All units downtrain, now!
The tunnels are the fastest access.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.560
Double time! Let's go! Go!

27:37.280 --> 27:39.699
- Ruth.
-Please don't talk.

27:39.783 --> 27:42.494
Whatever you think of me right now,
please put it aside--

27:42.577 --> 27:43.995
I need you not to talk.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.168
All these memories that I have of us.

27:54.589 --> 27:57.550
Moments that I took to be true.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.890
From sharing a meal together

28:03.973 --> 28:06.768
on our feet during
an all-night committee meeting, or...

28:07.894 --> 28:12.399
playing "good cop, bad cop"
to settle the squabbles in First.

28:15.443 --> 28:20.240
Or when you gave me
my personal commendation from Mr. Wilford

28:22.492 --> 28:25.370
for my outstanding dedication
to the company.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.789
You earned that.

28:28.623 --> 28:30.041
All those years...

28:31.668 --> 28:32.836
were you just laughing at me?

28:32.919 --> 28:34.254
-Eh?

28:34.337 --> 28:37.298
You made a fool of me. Over and over.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.467
The friendship was real.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.656
Did you kill him, Melanie?

29:04.033 --> 29:07.203
Wilford wasn't who you thought
he was, Ruth.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.621
He was a fraud.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.290
He built the Eternal Engine.

29:10.373 --> 29:13.084
No, he didn't. I did.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.255
I built this train, Ruth.

29:18.256 --> 29:21.634
I put everything I had into it.
Everything.

29:22.552 --> 29:25.013
And Wilford sold tickets.

29:26.806 --> 29:29.768
He didn't believe
it was possible to save humankind,

29:29.851 --> 29:32.562
and he was never even going to try.

29:32.645 --> 29:34.814
- That's not true.
-He was going to waste it.

29:36.232 --> 29:41.446
All he wanted was to live as well
as he could for as long as he could,

29:41.529 --> 29:44.157
surrounded by accolades and...

29:44.866 --> 29:48.244
booze and whores in the Nightcar.

29:49.996 --> 29:52.499
We wouldn't have made it one revolution.

29:56.211 --> 30:02.383
So I took <i>Snowpiercer,</i>
and I left him trackside to die.

30:06.429 --> 30:08.765
I'm sorry I lied to you, Ruth.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.643
I'm sorry for...

30:13.978 --> 30:16.397
all the things that I did wrong.

30:16.481 --> 30:22.362
But I am fighting
to do what I know is right.

30:24.781 --> 30:26.199
You're a filthy liar.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.328
And a murderer.

30:33.873 --> 30:35.500
Order will be restored.

30:46.636 --> 30:52.851
Tomorrow, you'll be executed
for your betrayal of <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

31:07.657 --> 31:08.950
Goodbye, Melanie.

31:19.627 --> 31:22.589
One Train! One Train!

31:22.672 --> 31:24.632
- Layton! Jackboots on the move.
- One Train!

31:24.716 --> 31:25.925
We gotta hurry.

31:26.009 --> 31:28.636
Wait, there's more.
The Brakemen are forming up in the Chains.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.263
Shit. Roche.

31:30.346 --> 31:33.057
One Train! One Train!

31:33.892 --> 31:34.893
One Train!

31:34.976 --> 31:37.478
Bloody hell, boss. Let's wait
for backup. Jackboots are on their way.

31:37.562 --> 31:41.107
Get your big boy pants on, Osweiller.
We're gonna hold this mob right here.

31:41.649 --> 31:43.443
There must be, like,
400 of 'em.

31:43.526 --> 31:46.321
Well, good thing for you, you've been
so nice to them over the years, then,

31:46.404 --> 31:47.572
isn't it?

31:57.916 --> 31:59.125
Just us, Roche.

31:59.709 --> 32:00.960
All right, that's far enough.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.881
You are of great disappointment
to me, Brakeman.

32:04.964 --> 32:07.342
Yeah, I figured I would be.

32:07.425 --> 32:10.219
Right in the middle of it, weren't ya?
The whole bleeding time.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.679
I picked a side.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.516
Look, we're not here to fight you, Roche.
We just need to pass through.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.186
No. You and your Tail friends,
you're not going anywhere.

32:18.269 --> 32:21.272
-You're certainly not going through here.
-The Tail's not the enemy.

32:21.356 --> 32:25.568
The hell they aren't! You hear that?
They want to tear this place apart.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.445
Our fight is not with Third.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.781
Roche, you should've sent
all these civilians home.

32:29.864 --> 32:31.199
See, I don't think so.

32:31.950 --> 32:36.496
'Cause nobody here is gonna believe
any of the lies you're selling 'em.

32:36.579 --> 32:40.583
Wilford's dead? What is that?
Some kind of psychological warfare?

32:40.667 --> 32:42.835
No, it's true, boss. He's not lying.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.713
Melanie threw him in a drawer
because he figured it out.

32:47.924 --> 32:52.303
Listen. You can believe the myth
if you want.

32:52.971 --> 32:56.015
The fact is,
First just learned the truth, too.

32:56.099 --> 32:59.185
Now somebody is going to
take over this train.

32:59.769 --> 33:02.814
Would you rather it be them or us?

33:04.315 --> 33:07.068
Third and the Tail, together.

33:07.777 --> 33:10.697
We're the ones who've been
keeping this train running anyway, right?

33:15.243 --> 33:17.453
Look, Roche,
I know you didn't choose this.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.915
Locking people up in cages
in the dark, starving?

33:22.125 --> 33:23.251
That's not you.

33:24.335 --> 33:28.548
You are a good cop.
Make the right choice. Just move aside.

33:29.132 --> 33:34.303
We're gonna need all the Brakemen
to keep the order when this is done.

33:36.472 --> 33:39.726
Come on, boss. Think of Anne.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.103
Think of your daughter.

33:47.608 --> 33:48.776
Balls to this, man.

33:48.860 --> 33:49.986
Osweiller, hold the line.

33:50.069 --> 33:51.696
This uniform's not gonna
protect me from that lot.

33:51.779 --> 33:54.657
-I'll look after myself.
-Stay in line. Get back in line!

34:03.291 --> 34:05.168
God damn it, Till.

34:05.251 --> 34:08.629
I have to go home
and tell my wife there's no Wilford?

34:16.345 --> 34:17.805
Stand aside, Brakemen.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.146
Come on, get 'em up faster.

34:25.229 --> 34:27.690
It takes time.
If I bring them out too quickly, it--

34:27.774 --> 34:30.526
- What?
-Just be patient. Please.

34:33.696 --> 34:36.282
What the hell, man? What is... Help me.

34:42.997 --> 34:45.416
What was that? Mandarin?

34:45.500 --> 34:47.126
Does he speak Mandarin?

34:47.210 --> 34:50.713
No. He doesn't speak.

34:50.797 --> 34:51.798
What?

34:56.094 --> 34:57.804
Gardiner reporting, sir.
Units here and ready.

34:57.887 --> 34:59.222
Good, son. Keep 'em moving.

34:59.305 --> 35:01.390
Let's move! Let's move!
Grab a shield and go!

35:01.474 --> 35:03.768
Double time, Jacks! Double time!

35:03.851 --> 35:05.311
-That's it.
- Let's go!

35:08.022 --> 35:10.233
Fighters, come forward!
I need all the fighters up front with me!

35:10.316 --> 35:11.943
Let's go. We gotta go. Hey...

35:13.653 --> 35:14.737
you got this.

35:19.867 --> 35:21.953
Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up.

35:25.289 --> 35:26.499
They'll be here any second.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.000
Quickly!

35:51.816 --> 35:53.151
I can hear 'em. I can hear 'em.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.696
Jackboots! They're coming! Move!

35:56.779 --> 35:58.406
Get it in position.

36:01.909 --> 36:07.081
Okay, hold. Hold. Hold. Almost.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.375
-Okay, now!
-Firing!

36:14.172 --> 36:15.298
Take cover!

36:17.842 --> 36:20.970
-Let's go. Reload! Reload!
-Advance!

36:22.722 --> 36:24.348
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.518
Second round. Second round.

36:27.602 --> 36:28.936
-Now!
-Yeah!

36:31.522 --> 36:32.481
Yes!

36:35.943 --> 36:36.986
What now, Commander?

36:37.069 --> 36:39.488
You keep pressing.
I'm gonna double back up top.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.866
Hit 'em in the arse. Your men, with me.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.039
- Advance! Advance!
-Clear it! Clear it!

36:50.625 --> 36:51.500
Now!

36:55.171 --> 36:56.464
Yeah!

37:48.099 --> 37:48.975
Grey!

37:50.476 --> 37:52.270
Attack!

37:52.353 --> 37:54.397
Attack!

37:56.691 --> 37:58.234
Hold the line!

38:01.904 --> 38:04.282
Hold the line!

38:06.075 --> 38:08.119
Archers, take out the front line!

38:10.204 --> 38:12.164
Till, they're taking the stairs.
Watch our backs!

38:16.877 --> 38:18.296
Till, behind you!

40:03.651 --> 40:06.237
Retreat!

40:08.948 --> 40:10.908
Fall back!

40:10.991 --> 40:14.328
Retreat! Retreat!

40:17.206 --> 40:18.374
Grey!

40:23.921 --> 40:25.172
Retreat!

40:25.256 --> 40:28.134
Go! Go! Go! Retreat!

40:38.644 --> 40:40.062
Go! Go! Go!

40:40.146 --> 40:41.772
-Go!
- Here they come!

40:42.356 --> 40:43.566
This is the last reload.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.576
That's it. Out of ammo.

40:54.326 --> 40:55.786
Fall back to the next barricade.

40:55.870 --> 40:58.873
I'll buy you some time.
Take the weapon. Do it!

40:58.956 --> 41:01.250
-Go!
-You heard him! Pull it back!

41:01.834 --> 41:05.129
Now's our chance! Go! Go! Go! Go!

41:05.796 --> 41:07.882
-One Train.
-One Train.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.346
Oh, God!

42:02.937 --> 42:06.524
We did it. We have them on their heels.

42:07.316 --> 42:08.526
Let's keep pressing.

42:10.110 --> 42:11.612
-Get everybody up.
-Yeah.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.076
Hey. You guys come here.

42:17.159 --> 42:19.203
Come on, man. Let's go.
Stay with them.

42:22.998 --> 42:23.916
Let's go, guys.

42:28.045 --> 42:28.879
Ready?

42:30.548 --> 42:31.840
Gather their weapons.

42:31.924 --> 42:36.637
Get everything you can.
We got a long march ahead of us.

42:37.513 --> 42:40.891
Get back! Get back! Everybody back!
Let's go! Let's go!

42:40.975 --> 42:42.726
Get back now! Let's go!

42:42.810 --> 42:44.853
Come on! Let's go! Move!

42:44.937 --> 42:47.523
Move up! Go back!

43:03.581 --> 43:04.582
Keep moving.

43:05.749 --> 43:08.460
That's the last of 'em.
Forward doors are closed. Seal it up.

43:10.504 --> 43:12.339
Layton. Layton.

43:13.048 --> 43:14.842
Fallback barriers are holding for now.

43:14.925 --> 43:16.760
-Big John?
-He didn't make it.

43:55.674 --> 43:57.343
Hold the line and resupply.

43:57.968 --> 44:00.596
On my orders,
we overrun their last defenses.

44:02.389 --> 44:03.641
Where are your people?

44:05.100 --> 44:06.101
I don't know.

44:06.685 --> 44:08.937
We should just come back
for the other sleepers.

44:09.021 --> 44:09.980
Wake them up later.

44:10.064 --> 44:13.025
No. We leave here, and we're prisoners.

44:13.108 --> 44:15.653
We keep going. Give me the keys.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.825
- Who's next?
- Pike.

45:01.907 --> 45:04.410
You have insight into Andre Layton?

45:05.577 --> 45:06.578
Oh, yeah.

45:08.122 --> 45:10.165
I know Layton intimately.

45:11.875 --> 45:14.294
Always so righteous with his politics.

45:14.378 --> 45:17.381
Mine were never refined enough for him.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.137
But...

45:26.932 --> 45:28.642
for another piece of this...

45:30.185 --> 45:31.353
Mmm.

45:35.023 --> 45:36.400
I'll give you Layton.

46:14.271 --> 46:18.650
<i>The thing about Layton</i>
<i>is he's an idealist.</i>

46:20.527 --> 46:21.695
<i>A good cop.</i>

46:24.281 --> 46:27.618
<i>He doesn't have the stomach</i>
<i>for sustained cruelty.</i>

46:32.414 --> 46:34.082
<i>He took a big risk today...</i>

46:36.293 --> 46:37.377
<i>and he lost.</i>

46:39.755 --> 46:40.839
<i>Keep grinding.</i>

46:43.300 --> 46:44.384
<i>He'll crumble.</i>
