<i>(Frankie) Finals--</i>

00:05.773 --> 00:08.693
<i>the time when students all over</i>
<i>put aside distractions</i>

00:08.800 --> 00:11.370
<i>and focus their full attention</i>
<i>on their studies...</i>

00:11.505 --> 00:12.758
<i>unless they're a mom.</i>

00:12.881 --> 00:14.634
(Whirring) Brick, get a napkin.

00:14.799 --> 00:17.040
Oh, that's okay.
I don't need one.

00:17.147 --> 00:19.830
Well, you're-- you're dripping
all over my book. Here.

00:21.843 --> 00:23.733
Give me that.
(Telephone rings)

00:25.126 --> 00:25.988
(Ring)

00:26.369 --> 00:27.756
(Beep) Hello?

00:27.952 --> 00:32.012
Hey, Janet.
Yep, pretty busy.

00:32.110 --> 00:34.102
Trying to study
for finals next week.

00:34.267 --> 00:37.324
Mom! Where's my favorite shirt?

00:37.470 --> 00:39.236
I thought your favorite shirt
was your chest.

00:39.326 --> 00:41.150
Don't try to be funny.
It's just sad.

00:41.344 --> 00:42.804
(Microwave beeps,
whirring stops) Uh-huh.

00:43.097 --> 00:45.077
- Yeah, uh-huh?
- Mom!

00:45.279 --> 00:47.328
I'm having dinner
with Cassidy's parents tonight.

00:47.431 --> 00:48.562
I need that shirt.

00:48.656 --> 00:51.201
I'm talking to Aunt Janet.
Try the laundry room.

00:51.305 --> 00:52.517
(Groans) God.

00:52.644 --> 00:54.793
So anyway, I'm trying
to learn this stuff, and it--

00:54.883 --> 00:56.083
Frankie, where are my keys?

00:56.208 --> 00:58.072
How am I supposed to know
where your keys are?

00:58.176 --> 00:59.812
Mom, you have to find
dad's keys.

00:59.914 --> 01:01.359
I have my driver's license
test today,

01:01.452 --> 01:03.722
and I cannot handle
any extra stress.

01:03.845 --> 01:06.963
(Snaps fingers) Hey, get-- get out of there.
They're not in my purse.

01:07.107 --> 01:08.489
Well, you're always taking 'em.

01:08.585 --> 01:10.783
I didn't take your stupid...

01:11.349 --> 01:12.659
(Keys jangle)

01:14.097 --> 01:15.672
Seriously, people,
I have to study.

01:15.755 --> 01:17.585
Out, out, out, out.

01:17.876 --> 01:20.587
<i>It's amazing how your kid</i>
<i>can be completely unhelpful</i>

01:20.691 --> 01:21.789
<i>and horrible to you,</i>

01:21.936 --> 01:24.169
<i>but he goes over</i>
<i>to someone else's house, and...</i>

01:24.287 --> 01:25.727
Hey, Mrs. Finch,
let me do that for you.

01:25.814 --> 01:27.358
Oh, thanks, Axl,
you're so thoughtful.

01:27.477 --> 01:29.727
Oh, I just don't like
sittin' around.

01:29.873 --> 01:31.446
When I'm home,
I have to be helping.

01:31.556 --> 01:32.886
So, um, where was I?

01:32.976 --> 01:35.893
Oh, yeah. So I'm running down
the hall...

01:36.000 --> 01:37.175
totally late for class.

01:37.287 --> 01:39.516
Well, of course,
my shoe comes off,

01:39.635 --> 01:41.790
but that's the problem
with velcro, right?

01:41.943 --> 01:44.460
Anyway, I'm just about
to my classroom,

01:44.582 --> 01:46.717
but here comes Mr. Farrar
with the tardy sweeps,

01:46.816 --> 01:48.842
so I reach into my pocket
for my hall pass,

01:48.957 --> 01:50.698
but all I find is a giant hole.

01:50.813 --> 01:51.982
(Chuckles)
Came up empty, did ya?

01:52.070 --> 01:53.909
Yeah. So at this point,
I figure I got three options--

01:54.022 --> 01:56.379
take detention, duck into
the girls' bathroom,

01:56.495 --> 01:57.641
or make a run for it.

01:57.792 --> 01:59.531
So guess what I--
(Knock on door)

02:00.352 --> 02:02.485
Hey. Remember me?

02:02.580 --> 02:04.933
- Cliff?
- Hey, there's the college boy!

02:05.047 --> 02:06.564
(Laughs) Hey!

02:06.894 --> 02:07.977
(Mrs. Finch laughs)

02:08.067 --> 02:09.770
Okay, I'm just gonna
start apologizing.

02:09.866 --> 02:11.835
I swear I didn't know
he was gonna be here.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.154
Oh, it's okay. (Chuckles)

02:13.292 --> 02:15.355
Um... (Clears throat) wait.
Who is he?

02:15.445 --> 02:17.668
Cliff. The old boyfriend
who shows up unannounced

02:17.791 --> 02:20.260
- to return a book.
(Chuckles) - Hmm.

02:20.384 --> 02:21.956
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

02:22.088 --> 02:23.692
I-- you know what? I'm just
gonna sneak out of here.

02:23.793 --> 02:25.429
No, stay.
We're just about to eat.

02:25.528 --> 02:26.504
Have you had dinner?

02:26.611 --> 02:27.921
Mom, that could not
be creepier.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.627
No, it's cool.
I'm cool.

02:29.832 --> 02:31.672
Um, Cliff, huh?

02:31.842 --> 02:36.238
Axl. Uh, yeah.
Take a seat or... whatever.

02:36.487 --> 02:39.221
Thanks, Axl.
You're a solid guy.

02:39.568 --> 02:41.872
- All right. Here you go.
- Thank you.

02:42.485 --> 02:45.223
- Let's eat.
- All right.

02:46.210 --> 02:48.481
Uh, so listen, I, uh,
I really just dropped by

02:48.598 --> 02:50.122
to return this to you, Kevin.

02:50.236 --> 02:51.972
- Oh.
- I found it really fascinating.

02:52.068 --> 02:53.039
Yeah, well,
I thought you might.

02:53.141 --> 02:54.048
It turns out the author

02:54.171 --> 02:56.043
- is actually a Professor at Northwestern.
- Mm-hmm.

02:56.153 --> 02:59.483
You know, Axl was in the middle
of a really interesting story.

02:59.670 --> 03:03.048
Oh, yeah.
How did that, uh, turn out?

03:03.161 --> 03:06.327
Oh. (Clears throat)
Well, turns out my hall pass

03:06.631 --> 03:08.813
had fallen down my pant leg
into my shoe.

03:09.066 --> 03:12.408
So I got out of detention
seven minutes early. Mm-hmm.

03:12.501 --> 03:14.397
Practically unheard of.
(Chuckles)

03:15.757 --> 03:18.180
- Um... yeah.
- Lasagna. Mm-hmm.

03:18.279 --> 03:19.424
Well, I should get back to...

03:20.397 --> 03:21.693
(Keys jangle and clatter)

03:21.806 --> 03:23.774
Nope. Did not get it.

03:23.919 --> 03:26.262
Oh, well, not everybody
passes the first time.

03:26.355 --> 03:29.008
Yeah. Apparently, they have
this list of infractions,

03:29.125 --> 03:31.909
that if you do any of them,
it's an automatic fail.

03:32.075 --> 03:34.343
- Mm.
- Speeding, failing to obey signs,

03:34.483 --> 03:38.112
backing over a curb,
running off the road...

03:38.214 --> 03:39.353
What did you do?

03:39.441 --> 03:40.474
All that.

03:40.563 --> 03:41.933
She even clipped
the side of the building.

03:42.026 --> 03:43.689
They're adding that
to the list for next year.

03:43.818 --> 03:44.977
Right.

03:47.809 --> 03:49.075
(Doorbell rings)

03:49.386 --> 03:50.227
(Sighs)

03:51.144 --> 03:51.922
Janet.

03:52.015 --> 03:53.196
Surprise!

03:53.370 --> 03:55.239
(Singsongy)
It's your fairy godsister!

03:55.324 --> 03:56.785
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

03:56.885 --> 03:58.060
(Laughs) Oh!

03:58.150 --> 04:00.219
Your stressed-out voice
on that phone

04:00.359 --> 04:03.419
was like a bat signal,
telling me, "come now!"

04:03.582 --> 04:05.067
Now don't you worry
about a thing.

04:05.193 --> 04:07.073
You just concentrate
on studying for your test.

04:07.185 --> 04:08.330
I am here to take care
of the cooking,

04:08.460 --> 04:10.136
the cleaning,
getting the kids to school.

04:10.282 --> 04:12.676
Yeah, definitely the cleaning.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.702
I have never loved you more
than this moment.

04:15.814 --> 04:17.012
- Oh!
- Oh!

04:17.163 --> 04:18.019
(Exhales)

04:18.493 --> 04:21.821
Hi, Brick!
Give your favorite auntie a hug!

04:22.343 --> 04:23.463
Is Lucy here?

04:23.583 --> 04:24.662
No, I'm sorry, Brick.

04:24.777 --> 04:26.674
She's at spring break
sleepaway camp this week.

04:26.772 --> 04:29.235
So I am here solo for one reason
and one reason only,

04:29.347 --> 04:31.365
and that is to take care
of your mama.

04:31.473 --> 04:34.941
Yay! I finally have someone
to take care of <i>me.</i> Ha!

04:35.536 --> 04:36.270
(Thuds)

04:36.361 --> 04:39.446
- Oh. - Oh, stop, Frankie.
I will take care of it.

04:40.235 --> 04:42.247
Okay. (Laughs)

04:46.659 --> 04:50.679
(Janet) Wow. You do not stack
your pans, do you? (Clanging)

04:50.771 --> 04:52.294
(Loud clattering)
You okay in there?

04:52.372 --> 04:55.282
Quick question--
where do you keep your strainer?

04:55.380 --> 04:56.530
We don't have one.

04:56.617 --> 04:58.582
We use the filter
on top of the coffeepot.

04:58.726 --> 05:01.847
If you have a problem with
caffeine, don't make spaghetti.

05:02.155 --> 05:03.680
Hey, mom, guess what?

05:03.777 --> 05:05.718
I was thinking about
my driver's test the other day,

05:05.810 --> 05:07.636
and, yeah,
feeling kind of bummed.

05:07.769 --> 05:11.560
And then it hit me--
I am so lucky.

05:11.680 --> 05:12.622
How do you figure?

05:12.734 --> 05:13.709
Well, if I had passed,

05:13.855 --> 05:16.306
my driver's license
would have said "Sue Sue Heck,"

05:16.431 --> 05:18.310
which would have been
a disaster.

05:18.465 --> 05:20.489
Oh, my God, Frankie,
do you mean to tell me

05:20.588 --> 05:22.307
that you still haven't changed
her middle name?

05:22.422 --> 05:25.004
It wasn't my fault. It was
a mistake at the hospital.

05:25.138 --> 05:26.552
You have to right this wrong.

05:26.672 --> 05:27.458
Look at this--

05:27.575 --> 05:30.557
Sue Sue Heck is your
procrastination personified.

05:30.670 --> 05:32.524
It's a message
that you send out to the world

05:32.633 --> 05:34.313
saying, "my parents do not care,

05:34.452 --> 05:36.569
my parents are lazy,

05:36.686 --> 05:39.096
my parents would
rather watch TV than--"

05:39.197 --> 05:40.665
Fine. She can change it.

05:40.790 --> 05:43.299
Aah! Aah!
I'm so excited!

05:43.420 --> 05:46.260
We all know how important
middle names are.

05:46.392 --> 05:48.046
(Laughs) Yeah!

05:48.365 --> 05:49.167
Ohh.

05:50.566 --> 05:52.714
(Inhales) Got that done.

05:54.650 --> 05:56.625
I'm so sorry about
my parents the other night.

05:56.931 --> 05:58.725
They took the breakup
pretty hard.

05:59.153 --> 05:59.894
If it were legal,

06:00.018 --> 06:01.951
I'm pretty sure they would
have chosen him over me.

06:02.055 --> 06:05.269
(Chuckles) Nah, it's cool.
He seems like a great guy.

06:05.437 --> 06:08.047
I mean, I'd never break up
with him, that's for sure.

06:08.155 --> 06:10.914
Unless it was to date me.
Because I am me.

06:11.010 --> 06:12.673
So... you see
my problem, right?

06:12.792 --> 06:16.102
(Laughs) Well, your problem
certainly isn't humility.

06:16.245 --> 06:17.252
Mmm.

06:20.401 --> 06:22.281
Hey.
(Shifts gears)

06:22.387 --> 06:23.475
Seriously?

06:23.594 --> 06:25.230
Ah. I like your bike, Axl.

06:25.345 --> 06:26.985
It's good for the planet.
Keep it up, man.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.274
Heh. That <i>is</i> the plan.

06:29.408 --> 06:30.745
So what are you
doing here, Cliff?

06:30.862 --> 06:33.031
Well, you remember how
we signed up to build the houses

06:33.149 --> 06:35.359
for Habitat for Humanity?

06:35.528 --> 06:37.334
(Car door closes) God, that
was, like, months ago.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.338
I know. I, uh,
I forgot about it, too.

06:39.436 --> 06:40.858
But it's actually
in a couple days.

06:40.994 --> 06:43.191
I didn't know if you
were still planning to go?

06:43.390 --> 06:44.402
I'm going.

06:44.563 --> 06:46.647
But if you don't wanna go now,
it's-- it's copacetic.

06:46.763 --> 06:48.408
I just need
to let them know, so...

06:48.510 --> 06:50.206
Oh, I don't think so.

06:50.396 --> 06:53.280
I want to help,
but things are different now.

06:53.977 --> 06:55.575
Hey, I mean... (Laughs)

06:55.704 --> 06:57.618
I don't want people not
having a house 'cause of me.

06:57.716 --> 07:00.668
So you guys should do it.
You should totally go.

07:00.776 --> 07:01.930
I'm all for helping people.

07:02.494 --> 07:03.963
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

07:04.078 --> 07:06.425
I mean,
maybe I could come with.

07:06.542 --> 07:07.650
You know, I was gonna
go wash old people

07:07.757 --> 07:09.907
down at the senior center,
but this is cool, too.

07:10.001 --> 07:11.322
That'd be terrific.

07:11.469 --> 07:13.509
Volunteering's
a beautiful way to give back.

07:13.709 --> 07:15.049
That's how C and I met,
actually.

07:15.152 --> 07:16.283
Cleaning pelicans.

07:16.384 --> 07:17.216
(Chuckles)

07:17.311 --> 07:18.462
So you guys want a ride home?

07:18.579 --> 07:20.516
Thanks, but I'm getting
a ride from Axl.

07:21.012 --> 07:22.252
Uh...

07:22.547 --> 07:24.671
no. No, you should
go with him.

07:24.778 --> 07:25.475
He's got a car,

07:25.587 --> 07:28.672
and I am totally copacetic
with that.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.573
Besides, I feel like
poppin' some wheelies.

07:31.423 --> 07:32.740
<i>Okay.</i>

07:33.386 --> 07:34.277
Call you later.

07:34.380 --> 07:36.191
Mm-hmm. Whoo!

07:47.304 --> 07:48.960
<i>Janet became more and more...</i>

07:49.141 --> 07:50.382
<i>helpful.</i>

07:50.518 --> 07:53.047
(Janet) Frankie, I can't get the
washing machine to work. (Clicking)

07:53.136 --> 07:54.558
I told you,
cold is hot and hot is cold,

07:54.664 --> 07:57.492
and you gotta jiggle the knob
before you can turn it.

07:57.599 --> 07:59.418
(Clicking continues) And
don't forget the duct tape.

07:59.529 --> 08:01.974
Nope. It still won't work.

08:02.447 --> 08:04.043
Plus you're out of detergent.

08:04.144 --> 08:05.257
I'm gonna put it
on your shopping list.

08:05.343 --> 08:06.943
- Where's your shopping list?
- There is no list.

08:07.057 --> 08:09.434
Okay, not to worry.
I will make one.

08:09.538 --> 08:11.569
But what should I write on?
Where's your scratch paper?

08:11.712 --> 08:13.305
Where isn't my scratch paper?

08:13.402 --> 08:14.716
Okay, no problem.
I will take care of it,

08:14.823 --> 08:16.957
because I am here to help you.

08:17.177 --> 08:19.911
So where do you want
your organization center?

08:20.014 --> 08:20.918
I like mine by the phone,

08:21.021 --> 08:22.571
but it can also be
by the fridge.

08:22.676 --> 08:23.789
Yeah, I don't care.

08:23.992 --> 08:24.647
But it's your house.

08:24.740 --> 08:26.311
You should want it
where you want it.

08:26.534 --> 08:28.982
- Fine. The fridge.
- Let's do phone.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.561
Hey, quick question--
what color pens do you like?

08:31.672 --> 08:33.288
I like black.
Some people like blue,

08:33.400 --> 08:35.711
but red can always come in handy
every once in a while.

08:35.808 --> 08:37.388
You know what?
I'm gonna get all three.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.960
Do you want me
to get sharpies, too?

08:39.057 --> 08:40.467
I can get sharpies.

08:40.842 --> 08:43.503
'Cause you only have one,
and those always come in handy.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.512
Dinner is served.

08:46.596 --> 08:48.619
Whoa! This actually
looks good.

08:48.709 --> 08:49.614
Where did you order from?

08:49.710 --> 08:51.240
- I made it.
- You made it <i>here?</i>

08:51.343 --> 08:52.726
<i>Our</i> kitchen can do this?

08:52.845 --> 08:55.736
I know fast food is
the normal routine around here.

08:55.837 --> 08:58.001
But that's only because
your mom is so disorganized.

08:58.112 --> 09:01.312
But I am here
to get her back on track.

09:01.410 --> 09:04.165
Okay, guys, I have been making
a list of my new middle names,

09:04.277 --> 09:06.856
and I will now present to you
the top candidates.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.147
Oh, yay. This is fun.

09:09.467 --> 09:10.458
"Bijou."

09:10.539 --> 09:11.506
Gesundheit.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.534
- I like "Bijou."
- I like "Gesundheit."

09:13.691 --> 09:14.920
Yeah, what else you got?

09:15.030 --> 09:17.402
Okay, next name-- "Coco."

09:17.516 --> 09:19.474
Okay. "Coco" it is.
Done and done.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.288
How committed are you to Sue?

09:21.386 --> 09:23.762
'Cause I think "Coco Gesundheit"
is a great name.

09:23.878 --> 09:25.818
Sue's not changing her name
to "Coco Gesundheit."

09:25.943 --> 09:27.023
Does it have to be a name?

09:27.200 --> 09:29.739
What about a sound,
like... "uch"?

09:29.868 --> 09:31.605
You can't have a name
that's a sound.

09:31.724 --> 09:33.363
Why not? It's what people
always say anyway.

09:33.485 --> 09:36.010
"Hey, look,
here comes Sue. <i>Uch."</i>

09:36.103 --> 09:38.546
Think it might work. U-C-H.
"Uch."

09:38.693 --> 09:40.399
Wouldn't "uch"
start with an "E"?

09:40.518 --> 09:42.408
Mm. Maybe a silent "Y."

09:42.525 --> 09:43.865
Her name's not
gonna be "uch."

09:43.966 --> 09:45.956
I was also thinking I could
go with something

09:46.041 --> 09:47.531
more like a place name.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.929
"Paris." "Brooklyn."

09:50.060 --> 09:52.330
"Gatlinburg."

09:52.426 --> 09:53.658
Three more winners,
right there.

09:53.752 --> 09:56.115
Dad, you're just agreeing
with whatever I say.

09:56.271 --> 09:57.373
I really have to figure
this out

09:57.508 --> 09:59.700
before you take me
to the courthouse on Thursday.

09:59.809 --> 10:01.051
I'm taking her
to the what-house?

10:01.159 --> 10:03.095
Well, I'm not doing it.
I have to study.

10:03.217 --> 10:04.676
And Janet apparently thinks

10:04.780 --> 10:07.053
this is the perfect time
to change her name.

10:07.310 --> 10:08.689
Then maybe you should
budget your time better,

10:08.790 --> 10:09.690
like your sister said.

10:09.768 --> 10:11.193
Oh, yeah, side with her.

10:11.290 --> 10:13.224
It's her fault
we're doing this right now.

10:13.334 --> 10:15.021
Well, Frankie, you should have
done it a long time ago.

10:15.118 --> 10:17.159
Well, if he would have
filled out the form correctly...

10:17.260 --> 10:18.424
You were there, too, Frankie.

10:18.511 --> 10:20.625
Yeah, I was busy pushing
a person through my legs.

10:20.737 --> 10:21.739
What were <i>you</i> doing?

10:21.837 --> 10:23.562
You know, we had
Lucy's form filled out

10:23.671 --> 10:25.248
before I even went
to the hospital.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.744
Nobody cares, Janet.

10:26.891 --> 10:29.520
You know what? Forget it.
I'll pick it on my own.

10:29.635 --> 10:31.835
I'll just pick a name at random,
and that'll be it.

10:33.181 --> 10:34.377
Bertha.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.379
I've got my bridge project
due tomorrow.

10:36.475 --> 10:37.846
What bridge project?

10:37.953 --> 10:39.688
We have to build a bridge
out of popsicle sticks.

10:39.789 --> 10:40.936
And you're just starting now?

10:41.035 --> 10:43.358
No, I'm not. I've been
eating popsicles for a week.

10:43.494 --> 10:45.456
Brick, we could have
just bought the sticks,

10:45.547 --> 10:46.991
and you could have
been using this time

10:47.083 --> 10:48.601
to build the actual bridge.

10:48.702 --> 10:49.741
What? You could have
told me that

10:49.837 --> 10:51.601
before I went up a pants size.

10:51.709 --> 10:53.691
"Gertrude."
Okay, maybe one more shot.

10:56.585 --> 10:59.870
"Sylvia."
What year is this book from?

10:59.968 --> 11:02.513
Okay, does anybody else have
any big projects due tomorrow

11:02.628 --> 11:04.129
that I don't know about?

11:04.231 --> 11:05.601
I'm building a house
for the poor.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.679
- Start here.
- Sue.

11:07.831 --> 11:09.942
Great. I picked my own name.

11:10.220 --> 11:12.892
Did you guys know
that "Sue" means "Lily"?

11:13.003 --> 11:14.956
Lily. That's not bad.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.316
It really fits you.

11:16.419 --> 11:18.108
I'm just saying, as her father,

11:18.220 --> 11:20.227
I would miss "Sue Sue."

11:20.331 --> 11:22.090
- You're taking her.
- Mm.

11:23.585 --> 11:25.503
Oh, my God. I overslept.

11:25.598 --> 11:27.297
Come on, Brick.
Grab some glue.

11:27.414 --> 11:29.204
We'll throw together a bridge
in the car.

11:29.363 --> 11:30.732
Wait.

11:30.947 --> 11:33.439
Did we finish that last night,
and I just forgot?

11:33.561 --> 11:34.598
No. You said you'd help me,

11:34.742 --> 11:35.687
and then you went to
the bathroom

11:35.776 --> 11:37.111
and never came back.

11:37.260 --> 11:38.525
Aunt Janet helped me.

11:38.638 --> 11:40.832
Yes. Anyone can make
the Golden Gate

11:40.956 --> 11:44.072
or Brooklyn Bridge,
but we made the Tappan Zee.

11:44.196 --> 11:45.586
Anyhow, there's no need
to rush, Frankie.

11:45.717 --> 11:48.001
I will be taking Brick
to school today.

11:48.380 --> 11:49.322
Oh!

11:49.836 --> 11:52.490
- And there's a frittata for
you in the oven. - Oh!

11:52.591 --> 11:54.198
I don't even know what that is!

11:54.618 --> 11:56.248
(Hammering)

11:57.017 --> 11:58.408
Thought you guys
could use a pick-me-up.

11:58.534 --> 12:00.006
Oh, my God, you read my mind.

12:00.122 --> 12:03.516
Oh, me, too. Love me
a good cup o' Joe. (Chuckles)

12:04.836 --> 12:06.502
Okay. I'm done
with these boards.

12:06.642 --> 12:07.791
What else can I do?

12:07.952 --> 12:09.859
Well, you can cut
some headers with a saw.

12:10.466 --> 12:11.775
Come on. I'll help you.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.348
Now you're gonna put
your hand right here.

12:16.453 --> 12:18.700
- Okay.
- All right? Other hand right here.

12:18.796 --> 12:20.620
(Whirring) Okay.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.499
Aah.
(Laughs)

12:23.395 --> 12:24.339
Good job.

12:26.670 --> 12:28.524
Okay. Watch your fingers.

12:31.379 --> 12:34.138
Here. Let me help you
with that.

12:34.663 --> 12:38.089
Ready? Right on the money.

12:38.751 --> 12:40.140
Axl!

12:40.291 --> 12:41.271
What are you doing?

12:41.390 --> 12:43.014
What? I thought
you needed help.

12:43.097 --> 12:45.625
But whatever if you don't.
No biggie.

12:45.917 --> 12:47.876
Okay. Let's raise this wall,
huh?

12:48.869 --> 12:50.212
(Mocking under breath)
"Raise this wall."

12:50.348 --> 12:52.712
One, two, three.

12:52.827 --> 12:54.094
(Grunts)

12:57.057 --> 12:58.876
All right, guys.
Right... there.

12:58.981 --> 13:00.402
Hey, Axl,
is your section braced?

13:00.495 --> 13:02.937
Uh, <i>yeah.</i> I think
I know what I'm doing.

13:03.039 --> 13:04.202
I've taken shop three times.

13:04.288 --> 13:06.838
I've built five partially
functioning bird houses.

13:07.001 --> 13:08.586
Never heard any
of the birds complaining.

13:08.861 --> 13:11.091
Okay, then.
I think we're good, guys.

13:11.465 --> 13:13.121
Good job.

13:14.208 --> 13:15.085
(Indistinct conversations)

13:15.220 --> 13:16.339
(Whistles)

13:17.577 --> 13:19.045
Ha ha.

13:19.779 --> 13:21.029
Yeah.

13:22.423 --> 13:23.553
(Creaks)

13:25.246 --> 13:27.043
(Coughs)

13:37.915 --> 13:39.836
Isn't this place amazing?

13:39.977 --> 13:43.259
Passports, marriage licenses,
jury duty--

13:43.396 --> 13:46.053
it's like all of life
in one building.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.843
You can do anything here.

13:47.955 --> 13:50.158
Except sit down...
or park for free.

13:50.266 --> 13:51.580
It's so cool.

13:51.882 --> 13:52.605
(Sighs)

13:52.723 --> 13:55.923
<i>And it</i> was <i>cool...</i>
<i>all day long.</i>

13:56.219 --> 13:58.295
<i>They went upstairs when they</i>
<i>were at the wrong window,</i>

13:58.461 --> 14:01.400
<i>they went downstairs</i>
<i>when they had the wrong form,</i>

14:02.128 --> 14:05.249
<i>and they went home when Sue</i>
<i>forgot her birth certificate.</i>

14:05.830 --> 14:08.219
<i>Yep, it was definitely cool.</i>

14:09.796 --> 14:11.743
Well, so much
for the bridge project.

14:15.449 --> 14:17.702
Brick, what happened?

14:24.591 --> 14:26.320
You didn't walk him in?

14:26.432 --> 14:28.898
It was only 8 feet, Frankie.

14:29.489 --> 14:31.654
Are you still
taking stuff in for him?

14:31.795 --> 14:33.744
Now how does that teach him
independence?

14:33.856 --> 14:34.720
You know, at Lucy's school,

14:34.821 --> 14:36.473
they teach the "little engine
that could" method.

14:36.605 --> 14:38.309
"I think I can, I think I can,"

14:38.406 --> 14:40.907
and eventually, they can.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.597
Yeah, well, this is Brick.

14:42.724 --> 14:43.988
I don't "think he can."

14:44.109 --> 14:45.798
I know he can't.

14:45.907 --> 14:47.860
Mr. Walker said if I bring
another one in tomorrow,

14:47.954 --> 14:49.639
he won't take off any points.

14:50.011 --> 14:51.610
Guess I better get to work.

14:52.170 --> 14:54.210
(Sighs deeply) Don't worry, Frankie.
I'll help him.

14:54.309 --> 14:55.628
He will get it done.

14:55.749 --> 14:57.406
Because I think you can.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.046
I think you can,
I think you can,

15:00.130 --> 15:02.048
I think you can,
I think you can,

15:02.155 --> 15:03.602
I think you can...

15:04.726 --> 15:07.251
(Whispering) I want <i>you</i>
to help me, not Aunt Janet.

15:07.389 --> 15:08.589
(Lowered voice)
Oh, cry me a river.

15:08.701 --> 15:10.861
I'm going on 40 years
of this crap.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.030
But she's so bossy.

15:13.210 --> 15:14.289
(Normal voice) Bossy.

15:14.403 --> 15:15.680
Shh!

15:17.256 --> 15:19.339
I'm changing my name.

15:19.810 --> 15:22.029
Yeah. I'm gonna be
Sue Lily.

15:22.148 --> 15:24.423
"Sue" means "Lily" in French.

15:24.530 --> 15:25.890
(Woman) Next?

15:27.819 --> 15:28.910
Wait a second.

15:29.008 --> 15:31.444
If "Sue" means "Lily,"

15:31.573 --> 15:36.095
then "Sue Lily"
is the same as "Sue Sue."

15:36.220 --> 15:37.858
Oh, no. No, no, no,
no, no, no.

15:37.963 --> 15:40.010
I-I need to change it.
I-I need a pen.

15:40.109 --> 15:41.822
Where's the form? We need
to go to the back of the line.

15:41.919 --> 15:43.646
Not a chance. We're next.

15:43.731 --> 15:44.868
You take one step
out of this line,

15:44.953 --> 15:47.982
and I'm changing my name
and vanishing without a trace.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.346
Okay. Okay.

15:49.441 --> 15:50.560
Yeah, uh, I can do this.

15:50.681 --> 15:53.041
Uh... Sue... Betsy.

15:53.159 --> 15:54.653
Sue... Mackenzie.

15:54.774 --> 15:56.649
Sue... Bench.

15:56.788 --> 15:58.664
Sue... Probation.

15:58.768 --> 16:00.538
(Woman) - Next.
(High-pitched voice) - Sue Next!

16:03.069 --> 16:05.015
Let's see. Okay.

16:05.129 --> 16:07.275
You're changing your name
from Sue Sue Heck.

16:07.499 --> 16:08.675
Sue Sue?

16:09.173 --> 16:10.804
Wow, that's different.

16:11.062 --> 16:12.728
You know, I've been doing
this job for 40 years,

16:12.830 --> 16:14.126
and I gotta tell you--

16:14.259 --> 16:16.903
I've never seen a name
as unusual as Sue Sue.

16:17.022 --> 16:18.299
Really?

16:18.787 --> 16:20.243
Wait!
(Thud)

16:20.831 --> 16:22.029
_

16:23.540 --> 16:26.258
_

16:33.715 --> 16:35.641
Okay, if... (Sighs)
if you squint

16:35.758 --> 16:37.349
and have
a real good imagination,

16:37.447 --> 16:39.083
that sort of
looks like a bridge.

16:39.196 --> 16:41.435
Mom, this isn't your best work
of my work.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.737
Look, we're shooting
for a "D" here, Brick,

16:43.847 --> 16:45.544
which is probably what
I'm gonna get on my own test

16:45.649 --> 16:47.581
if I don't start studying.
Now get to bed.

16:47.722 --> 16:48.832
(Sighs)

16:51.285 --> 16:52.855
(Dog barking in distance)

16:53.117 --> 16:54.319
(Sighs)

16:55.111 --> 16:57.751
Frankie, I'm sensing
your stress.

16:58.003 --> 17:03.682
What... can... I... do...
to... help... you?

17:03.858 --> 17:06.140
Honestly, just let me study.

17:06.294 --> 17:07.763
You know what I think?

17:07.862 --> 17:10.637
(Singsongy) I think somebody
could use a little sister time.

17:10.756 --> 17:12.035
Somebody else, maybe.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.922
- Just-- just let me--
- Ah, ah, ah!

17:15.022 --> 17:16.593
- Oh, come on. Let me--
- You can't fool me.

17:16.707 --> 17:17.684
I know you better than anybody.

17:17.777 --> 17:19.686
Something is wrong.
Just tell your sissy. Come on.

17:19.780 --> 17:20.746
There's nothing to tell.

17:20.846 --> 17:22.367
Are you taking time for you?

17:22.458 --> 17:23.693
- I'm trying.
- Come on.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.800
This is just Frankie Pants
and Janny Boo talking.

17:25.924 --> 17:27.611
I can tell that you're unhappy.

17:27.728 --> 17:30.083
Really? And can you tell
I'm unhappy right now?

17:30.213 --> 17:33.033
'Cause Janny Boo
is driving me nuts!

17:33.169 --> 17:34.027
You say you're helping,

17:34.142 --> 17:36.180
and then all you do is
suck and suck

17:36.291 --> 17:38.362
and suck up all my time!

17:38.468 --> 17:40.716
You're like
an emotional vacuum cleaner!

17:40.835 --> 17:41.701
"Oh, can I help you?

17:41.802 --> 17:43.468
Can I clang the pots
a little louder?

17:43.577 --> 17:44.987
Can I throw my life
in your face

17:45.085 --> 17:46.311
to show you
how much better it is?"

17:46.407 --> 17:48.463
Oh, Janet's here! Yay!

17:48.584 --> 17:50.503
My life is <i>so</i> much easier!

17:50.612 --> 17:53.680
How could I ever thank you?
Ooh! I know.

17:53.794 --> 17:57.001
I'll write you a note from your
friggin' organization center!

17:59.589 --> 18:01.600
(Book thuds, sticks clatter)

18:02.216 --> 18:03.590
(Sighs deeply)

18:10.971 --> 18:12.013
(Sighs)

18:12.096 --> 18:13.922
Tough day at
the do-whatever-you-want plant?

18:14.013 --> 18:15.412
I don't wanna talk about it.

18:15.501 --> 18:16.295
Okay, thanks.

18:16.387 --> 18:19.538
It's just... ugh! Cassidy
and her dumb ex-boyfriend.

18:19.638 --> 18:20.972
She's all into him now.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.082
Oh. She said that?

18:23.170 --> 18:24.992
No, but it's totally obvious.

18:25.102 --> 18:26.455
He stayed for dinner
the other night.

18:26.589 --> 18:27.585
So she invited him?

18:27.674 --> 18:30.458
No. She was all,
"oh, my God, Axl,

18:30.567 --> 18:32.508
this is so awkward.
Are you okay?"

18:32.752 --> 18:33.647
So what'd <i>you</i> say?

18:33.733 --> 18:34.623
I said it was fine,

18:34.723 --> 18:35.851
but then he shows up at school

18:36.010 --> 18:38.795
and invites us to build houses
for poor people.

18:38.890 --> 18:40.410
Sounds like a real jerk.

18:40.492 --> 18:44.659
Yeah. So today, we're hammering
nails and sawing boards

18:44.761 --> 18:47.130
and stuff, and of course,
he's all good at it,

18:47.268 --> 18:50.286
and then I drop one wall
and slam my hand in a car door,

18:50.409 --> 18:52.466
and everyone's all,
"oh, my God, are you okay?

18:52.560 --> 18:53.569
Do you want us to take you
to the hospital?

18:53.689 --> 18:55.596
You want a granola bar?
You want some tea?"

18:55.697 --> 18:56.878
I mean, right?

18:59.555 --> 19:00.835
You had to be there.

19:01.395 --> 19:02.585
Were <i>you</i> there?

19:02.758 --> 19:04.928
Uh... you-- you know what?
You don't get it,

19:05.061 --> 19:06.242
'cause... (Blows raspberry)

19:06.468 --> 19:08.620
they were... they...

19:11.861 --> 19:13.168
I'm an idiot.

19:13.524 --> 19:14.768
There you go.

19:19.190 --> 19:20.115
(Crying)

19:20.222 --> 19:23.260
Oh, Janet, don't cry.

19:23.377 --> 19:24.557
I didn't mean it.

19:24.661 --> 19:27.502
I-I've been stressed out.
I-I was so mean.

19:27.578 --> 19:28.867
I'm a mean, mean sister.

19:28.954 --> 19:30.309
Yes, you are.

19:30.577 --> 19:33.344
Look, it's just
that I'm so tired,

19:33.427 --> 19:34.629
and I have this test coming up,

19:34.702 --> 19:35.767
and I'm scared
I'm going to fail.

19:35.851 --> 19:36.855
And then you show up,

19:36.967 --> 19:38.943
and everything's
all great for you.

19:39.073 --> 19:41.928
Look, I know my life's a mess,
and you're just trying to help,

19:42.032 --> 19:44.126
but I feel like you're
judging me, and you're right--

19:44.216 --> 19:46.120
Oh, my God,
I'm not judging you.

19:46.246 --> 19:48.211
You're the one
who's got it all together.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.958
What? You've just
spent a week in this war zone.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.132
How can you say that?

19:52.214 --> 19:53.764
You honestly think
<i>your</i> life's a mess?

19:53.912 --> 19:55.006
<i>My</i> life's a mess.

19:55.146 --> 19:58.355
I'm a horrible mother.
Lucy's out of control.

19:58.465 --> 19:59.486
It doesn't matter
what I say to her.

19:59.592 --> 20:01.735
She screams at me.
She throws her toys.

20:01.828 --> 20:05.408
She's turning out bad, Frankie.
Really, really <i>bad.</i>

20:05.500 --> 20:07.514
- What?
- See this?

20:07.615 --> 20:08.441
(Gasps)

20:08.533 --> 20:11.025
This was me asking her
if she wanted to take a bath.

20:11.128 --> 20:12.272
Did you have that looked at?

20:12.362 --> 20:13.780
She's a nightmare.

20:13.883 --> 20:17.207
The only break I get is when she
holds her breath and passes out.

20:17.322 --> 20:18.363
Mm.

20:18.463 --> 20:19.685
We sent her away, Frankie.

20:19.795 --> 20:21.602
Shipped her off
to a fix-it camp.

20:21.698 --> 20:24.425
Camp Tantrum.
They call it Camp Tant-a-Rum,

20:24.523 --> 20:25.824
but we all know what it is.

20:25.927 --> 20:27.851
Lucy's gonna be so pissed
when she gets home.

20:27.939 --> 20:30.271
I'm scared, Frankie.
I'm so scared.

20:30.368 --> 20:33.229
I had no idea. Oh!
(Crying)

20:33.350 --> 20:34.499
<i>I really didn't.</i>

20:34.600 --> 20:35.967
<i>All those years,</i>
<i>you can know somebody</i>

20:36.085 --> 20:37.812
<i>and really never know.</i>

20:37.932 --> 20:39.545
<i>That's the thing</i>
<i>about realizations.</i>

20:39.693 --> 20:41.740
<i>Sometimes they come suddenly...</i>

20:41.988 --> 20:44.185
I know I said
you needed me, Frankie.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.900
But that's not why I'm here.

20:46.406 --> 20:48.252
The truth is, <i>I</i> needed <i>you.</i>

20:48.401 --> 20:51.672
(Voice breaks)
Oh! I need you, too.

20:51.771 --> 20:53.208
- Really?
- Yes.

20:53.324 --> 20:55.502
- Oh!
- Oh! (Crying)

20:57.703 --> 20:59.805
You don't keep tissues
on your nightstand?

21:00.279 --> 21:02.627
Seriously, Frankie,
how do you live like this?

21:02.759 --> 21:04.339
(Laughs) (Laughs)

21:06.111 --> 21:08.149
Oh! (Laughs)

21:09.726 --> 21:12.637
<i>Sometimes they come after</i>
<i>11 hours at the courthouse.</i>

21:29.302 --> 21:32.574
<i>And sometimes you worry</i>
<i>they come a little too late.</i>
