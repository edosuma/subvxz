00:01.960 --> 00:05.236
<i>Hospitals are filled with people</i>
<i>who came off 18-hour shifts.</i>

00:05.320 --> 00:08.790
<i>When a patient dies, it's not uncommon</i>
<i>to take them to the morgue,</i>

00:08.880 --> 00:10.996
<i>then grab a little shuteye in their bed.</i>

00:11.080 --> 00:14.038
<i>Unfortunately, sometimes</i>
<i>you're beaten to the punch.</i>

00:14.120 --> 00:15.917
I'm up.

00:18.320 --> 00:22.791
You can hardly notice it.
It's actually kind of pre <i>tty</i>.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.872
- Jackass.
- Look who's here.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.952
<i>I'm never happy when a guy</i>
<i>comes back into Elliot's life,</i>

00:29.040 --> 00:31.918
<i>but at least with Sean</i>
<i>it's entertaining.</i>

00:32.000 --> 00:33.592
Thanks for the latte.

00:33.680 --> 00:37.389
I should have warned you that
they make the hottest coffee in town.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.392
No sweat. Lesson learned.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.790
Is it me or do those two seem
less aw <i>kw</i> ard around each other?

00:44.720 --> 00:47.280
See you, Elliot.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.231
See you.

00:56.040 --> 00:59.350
I have some news.
We picked a date for the wedding.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.635
Tell 'em, Turk. April 24th.

01:02.720 --> 01:05.313
No way. Mine is April 25th. 200 <i>6</i>.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.750
The place I love in Connecticut
books up early, so I took a shot.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.479
One, two, three. Crazy.

01:12.560 --> 01:15.028
So you've never dreamt
about your wedding day?

01:16.560 --> 01:20.951
Do you, John Dorian,
take Marcia Brady to be your wife?

01:21.040 --> 01:24.476
- My name is Maureen McCormick.
- Marcia, please.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.915
Father, continue.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.596
No, I have not. By the way, I know
an amazing Journey cover band.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.240
You should get 'em
to play at your reception.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.595
Not everyone loves Journey
as much as you.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.750
I don't love Journey.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.240 --> 01:50.596
I love 'em. They're called
the Loving-Touching-Squeezings.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.274
They rock.
Book 'em now, thank me later.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.993
<i>After that, the day got worse.</i>

01:57.080 --> 01:59.150
Thanks for giving me a ride to see Sean.

01:59.240 --> 02:02.198
I've never been to SeaWorld.
What does Sean do here?

02:02.280 --> 02:05.875
- Probably cleans up the seal poop.
- There he is.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.630
Lame.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.311
Who left this urine here?

02:36.400 --> 02:38.709
Someone's got a secret admirer.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.997
Dr Kelso, someone left
this urine specimen sitting around.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.799
What's interesting
is the name's been ripped off.

02:44.880 --> 02:48.668
Sweetheart, I think you're confusing
"interesting" with "boring."

02:48.760 --> 02:51.354
- I can't believe you set a date.
- It's happening.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.590
Wedding talk? How lovely.

02:53.680 --> 02:58.754
Listen, Hilton sisters, Mr Quinn in 20 <i>6</i>
still has a severely shattered clavicle

02:58.840 --> 03:00.751
and he needs a surgical consult.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.673
Seeing as he's your patient
and you're a surgeon,

03:03.760 --> 03:06.832
gosh, I was hoping that if you two hens
have an extra moment

03:06.920 --> 03:09.753
between choosing centre pieces
and deciding

03:09.840 --> 03:13.196
exactly how you're gonna attach
that veil onto baldy's head,

03:13.280 --> 03:15.350
it would just be super-de-duper

03:15.440 --> 03:20.070
if you could peek in and give him
the old lookie-Ioo, wouldn't it?

03:20.160 --> 03:23.072
Anyway, I'm really psyched for you guys.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.355
It's gonna be harder for us to hang out.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.557
You're gonna be married, man.
You're gonna have a house.

03:28.640 --> 03:32.474
You're gonna spend weekends chasing
around little Arturo and Rosalia.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.552
- You mean Tamika and Fuqua?
- You should talk to Carla.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.108
This is the end of a major chapter
in our lives.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.953
Know what?
I'm gonna take you out tonight.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.873
We're gonna get some dinner,
a nice bottle of wine.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.269
Sounds like a man-date.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.830
Turk, why are you so afraid
of loving me?

03:50.720 --> 03:52.631
Up.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.397
- Do you actually talk to each other?
- He's just a dolphin.

03:58.120 --> 04:01.829
Because, Bruce, then she would think
I was crazy, that's why.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.595
I am so glad that we're dating again.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.274
We're not dating.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.954
Why don't you wanna be dating?

04:11.040 --> 04:16.831
Well, all right. Why is everything
so much easier with dolphins?

04:16.920 --> 04:19.070
You're not trying to date a dolphin.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.755
No. Well, not after that big talk
they gave us.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.752
Last time we were together
everything was going great

04:26.840 --> 04:29.718
and then out of nowhere
you dumped me for your job.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.633
I've never been so crushed
in my entire life.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.119
Really?

04:35.120 --> 04:38.237
That is not something
that I'm happy about.

04:38.320 --> 04:43.235
If I hadn't made medicine my priority,
I wouldn't have lasted.

04:43.320 --> 04:47.233
But now things are gonna be different
because I'm different.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.231
I'm New Elliot.

04:49.320 --> 04:54.394
Do you think the New Elliot
would like to go to dinner tonight?

04:55.360 --> 04:59.114
I don't know. She's very busy.

05:06.560 --> 05:10.838
Laverne, by this afternoon we're
gonna find out whose urine this is.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.797
Why don't you do that?

05:12.880 --> 05:17.829
I'm gonna get my tooth fixed
so I can stop looking like Larry Holmes.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.959
You're forcing me to say what I prayed
I'd never have to say again to a woman.

05:22.040 --> 05:26.397
Please, put down the cup of urine.

05:26.480 --> 05:30.678
- $<i>6</i>.50, please.
- $<i>6</i>.50 for an egg-salad sandwich?

05:30.760 --> 05:35.390
$4.50 for the salad. $2 for the apple
juice you put in the urine container.

05:35.480 --> 05:38.836
- Who would do that?
- Just the burger for me.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.598
Before I examine your clavicle,
let me ask you,

05:44.680 --> 05:47.592
is it out of line for me
to take my best friend to dinner?

05:47.680 --> 05:50.911
- Well, I...
- This is like the end of an era.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.070
We've always been known
as Turk and J.D.

05:53.160 --> 05:56.516
In college, people were,
"When are Turk and J.D. Getting here?"

05:56.600 --> 06:00.388
In med school everyone was like,
"When are Turk and J.D. Getting here?"

06:00.480 --> 06:02.994
- We didn't have a car.
- We were together so much,

06:03.080 --> 06:06.868
an Indian girl slept with him cos
she thought his name was Andjaydee.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.871
It was a very good day for me.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.520
See? This is the kind of stuff
I'm gonna miss.

06:11.600 --> 06:15.434
The reminiscing, the way your breath
always smelled of curry.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.750
All right, fine. It's a man-date.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.195
We're still on for surgery
tomorrow, right?

06:20.280 --> 06:23.556
Right. When you slice me up,
make sure you don't mess up my tat.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.552
- My fiancÃ©, Tracy, would kill me.
- I had a tattoo once.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.279
You got your face painted
at the hospital picnic.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.999
I was a cougar.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.991
See you later.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.912
Does this shade of red
make me look like a clown?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.514
No, Barbie.

06:45.600 --> 06:50.151
It makes you look like a prostitute
who caters exclusively to clowns.

06:50.240 --> 06:54.631
I'm sorry, that was my mistake. I keep
forgetting you're a horrible person.

06:54.720 --> 06:58.190
Backbone Barbie. Excuse me.

06:59.280 --> 07:02.829
You wouldn't be signing out Mr Hudson
to the on-call resident?

07:02.920 --> 07:05.593
- Yeah. Why?
- He's your patient.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.557
He needs a lumbar puncture

07:07.640 --> 07:10.871
and you can't count on
the on-call resident to do that.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.793
It's just that I've got a date
with this guy named Sean.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.633
Would you do me a favour
and excuse me for one moment?

07:22.400 --> 07:24.834
I cannot miss this dinner.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.150
Barbie, I actually see your point.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.754
You should, in fact,
go on your little date.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.992
I have some busy work that's gonna take
me in the vicinity of Mr Hudson's room.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.117
I'll just pop my head in
and tell him that he's going to die.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.034
But if you have a moment between dinner
and giving it away for free,

07:41.120 --> 07:44.032
if you could call Mr Hudson's
wife and kids

07:44.120 --> 07:47.829
and tell them about, you know,
the dying.

07:50.600 --> 07:55.355
I know. This would be just the most
terrific place to work on the planet

07:55.440 --> 07:59.035
if it weren't for all these sick people,
wouldn't it?

08:05.120 --> 08:08.192
I'm sorry. I just thought
that as a urine-lab technician

08:08.280 --> 08:11.795
you'd be at least half as interested
in urine as I am.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.953
It's not any of my business,
but I think I know whose whiz that is.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.917
I love you.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.797
OK. Go.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.996
His name is Mr Freely.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.878
- First name?
- I.P.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.871
I.P. Freely?

08:29.120 --> 08:31.190
Funny in third grade, funny now.

08:32.080 --> 08:35.868
Listen, Stretch, if you know who this
belongs to, I'd fess up right now.

08:35.960 --> 08:39.032
Or I'm gonna grab you
by the back of that two-dollar haircut

08:39.120 --> 08:42.395
and force feed you this sample
so you carry it around all day.

08:42.480 --> 08:47.349
That way, if I want it back, I point you
at a beaker and squeeze really hard.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.796
You got any more funny jokes
you gotta tell me?

08:50.880 --> 08:53.030
No, ma'am.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.157
<i>In a hospital, eve</i> ry <i>day</i>
<i>is made up of little battles.</i>

08:56.240 --> 08:58.834
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

08:58.920 --> 09:02.629
I officially don't care anymore
who peed in this jar.

09:03.320 --> 09:07.916
<i>Sometimes you fight them not because</i>
<i>you want to but because you have to.</i>

09:08.000 --> 09:10.514
Shut up.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.750
<i>Other times you fight for what you want.</i>

09:12.840 --> 09:15.559
Sean, I can't make it to dinner.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.313
<i>But what you want isn't willing to wait.</i>

09:18.400 --> 09:20.277
Sure, Elliot.

09:22.120 --> 09:25.829
<i>If you're lucky, there's no battle,</i>
<i>everything works out perfectly.</i>

09:25.920 --> 09:28.957
Yo. For a second I thought
you weren't coming, dude.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.395
Hey. It's Turk Andjaydee.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.755
And J.D.

09:33.840 --> 09:37.469
- I'm so psyched we're doing this.
- So am I. Todd, over here, buddy.

09:37.560 --> 09:42.031
Excuse me for a second, fellas. I'm
gonna go tell that girl my name's Beer.

09:42.120 --> 09:46.079
Then I'm gonna offer her some beer nuts.
What's up?

09:48.200 --> 09:50.111
Mental five.

09:51.480 --> 09:54.950
- You invited the Todd?
- Dude, we left at the same time.

09:55.040 --> 09:58.237
I didn't know what to say to him.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.871
I thought we were gonna reminisce,
get a little deep.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.349
Me too. I'm totally bummed out,
all right?

10:06.440 --> 10:08.954
That was the hottest slap
I've ever gotten.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.315
I can't believe I wasn't gonna come out.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.153
Thanks for twisting my arm.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.389
I'm outta here.

10:19.680 --> 10:22.148
Come on, man. Fine, man.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.915
I can have plenty of deep moments
with the Todd.

10:27.120 --> 10:31.636
Hey, do you think gay dudes
get turned on by their own wieners?

10:31.720 --> 10:33.631
Oh, my God.

10:36.680 --> 10:39.592
<i>I wanted to let Turk know</i>
<i>how I felt about how he behaved,</i>

10:39.680 --> 10:44.071
<i>so I decided to throw him Mr Quinn's</i>
<i>chart with a little extra mustard sauce.</i>

10:44.160 --> 10:46.071
Morning, buddy.

10:49.600 --> 10:53.718
I apologise for that. To you, not you.
I thought we were friends.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.315
Again, not you and me. Me and him.
Anyway, have a nice day.

10:57.400 --> 11:01.109
You. Not you. Nor you.

11:02.200 --> 11:07.672
This whole you leaving the room whenever
I enter it thing that you're doing is...

11:07.760 --> 11:09.478
I love it.

11:09.560 --> 11:12.313
Since I got engaged,
he's crazier than my fiancÃ©e.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.233
Although Carla is going a little nuts
about the dress.

11:15.320 --> 11:19.393
- Dude, what's up with Tracy?
- Dude, Tracy's a guy.

11:19.480 --> 11:22.278
- That would make you gay.
- I am gay.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.833
Neat.

11:24.920 --> 11:29.152
Never underestimate just exactly
how uncomfortable this makes him.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.877
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Sean, it's Elliot.

11:35.960 --> 11:39.111
I know that last night
didn't go exactly as we planned it,

11:39.200 --> 11:41.191
so I thought we could reschedule.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.397
Look, I think this whole thing
may be a bad idea.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.711
Just give me another chance?

11:47.800 --> 11:51.509
I kind of already have plans tonight.
This girl Be <i>tty</i> from work.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.830
- Sean...
- <i>I'll see you.</i>

11:57.720 --> 12:02.191
I did what I had to do and I don't need
you judging me right now, Be <i>tty</i>.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.191
What do you know?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.834
I'm telling you, it was a clipboard.
It came right out of the sky.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.831
I'm sure it did, sir.

12:25.960 --> 12:29.509
Wendy, would you watch the phones
while I go back to the urology lab?

12:29.600 --> 12:30.874
- Sure.
- Thanks.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.714
Nurse Espinosa, I requested
that you transfer Mrs Merchant

12:34.800 --> 12:36.631
to the Morning Side Nursing Home.

12:36.720 --> 12:40.190
I'd take her myself, but I'd run
the risk of bumping into my mother.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.669
The last thing I need
is another conversation

12:42.760 --> 12:46.309
about why she shouldn't have to spend
her golden years in a bunk bed.

12:46.400 --> 12:51.474
Now, either do the job we pay you for
or I'll find someone else who will.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.551
Have a great day.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.159
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>The janitor's afraid of Carla.</i>

13:07.240 --> 13:09.913
<i>How could I use this to my advantage?</i>

13:10.520 --> 13:15.036
Listen, I want you to lay off J.D. Stop
accusing him of things he didn't do.

13:15.680 --> 13:19.468
And bring him a fruit smoothie
every day.

13:39.240 --> 13:41.515
I have to learn Spanish.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.194
What's up?

13:44.280 --> 13:47.431
I found out my favourite chips
cause anal leakage and...

13:47.520 --> 13:51.069
- I'm not talking to you.
- How did you get him to stop talking?

13:51.160 --> 13:53.720
I don't get it.
You made me feel like an idiot.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.791
I always make him feel like an idiot.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.474
- Why the big deal?
- You never tell me how you feel.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.120
Damn it all.
I never tell you how I feel.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.510
- I'm not talking to you.
- Finally. Thank you.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.558
Ever since I met you,
it's been like this one-way street.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.200
I tell you everything
and you tell me nothing.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.556
- What are you afraid of?
- Hey, guys. This is my fiancÃ©, Tracy.

14:13.640 --> 14:16.393
This is Dr Turk and Dr Dorian.

14:21.120 --> 14:24.078
Honest to God, I love this place.

14:30.280 --> 14:34.239
So, thanks to you,
Sean blew me off, but I'm OK.

14:34.320 --> 14:38.757
New Elliot's just gonna get him back
because New Elliot is a fixer.

14:38.840 --> 14:42.958
Like if that guy's spleen ruptured,
I would just go over and fix him.

14:43.040 --> 14:46.032
- My spleen is going to rupture?
- Relax. You're fine.

14:46.120 --> 14:49.271
I'm just going to show Sean
that he will always come first.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.113
I hate to interrupt
this one-gal pep rally, Barbie,

14:52.200 --> 14:56.079
but I give this guy two weeks, three
if you are just terrific in the sack.

14:56.160 --> 15:00.278
Well, then, it's three.
I mean, you're wrong.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.954
I just got off the phone with Jordan

15:03.040 --> 15:05.838
who told me that my son
rolled over for the first time.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.480
Oh, my God. That's so great.

15:08.560 --> 15:12.155
Big "who cares?" Not about Jack
rolling over for the first time,

15:12.240 --> 15:15.676
but about your reaction to
my son rolling over for the first time.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.593
Point being that I missed it
because I was here.

15:18.680 --> 15:22.912
You might wanna write this down,
because here comes the inside scoop:

15:23.000 --> 15:26.037
The hospital comes first.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.156
- Always.
- Always?

15:28.240 --> 15:30.151
Forever and ever.

15:30.240 --> 15:35.598
And ever and ever and ever...
You getting this?

15:40.840 --> 15:43.513
So I'll pick you up tomorrow.

15:45.920 --> 15:48.150
And ever and ever...

15:50.960 --> 15:54.475
You're not that comfortable
with the man-on-man action, are you?

15:54.560 --> 15:57.916
So I'm a little homophobic.
We all got our stuff, right?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.434
I bet deep down inside
you're a little racist.

16:00.520 --> 16:04.513
- Marrying a black guy.
- How pissed are your parents, honestly?

16:04.600 --> 16:07.831
So what makes you so uncomfortable?
Is it the sex?

16:07.920 --> 16:11.549
I don't love the idea
of kissing anyone with a moustache.

16:11.640 --> 16:15.349
That's why I pretend to have a cold
when Carla's aunt comes to town.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.595
What really freaks me out, though,

16:21.680 --> 16:24.877
is the thought of being that open
with another guy, any guy.

16:24.960 --> 16:28.430
I don't know what it is. That's just
the way I've been my whole life.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.115
Maybe it's because I'm scared, you know?

16:32.200 --> 16:35.431
Dude, that's a little gay.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.674
What?

16:40.760 --> 16:43.035
I feel bad about what happened before,

16:43.120 --> 16:46.829
so I went and searched through,
like, 40 bags of garbage

16:46.920 --> 16:49.434
and I found the torn-off urine label.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.671
- Also found half a tooth.
- Over here, jumpsuit.

16:52.760 --> 16:55.957
Mr Thomas Burke.
Let's get you to the lab.

16:57.320 --> 17:01.313
Hey, studly, when you were out
rooting through the dumpster,

17:01.400 --> 17:04.597
you didn't stumble across
your own testicles, did you?

17:04.680 --> 17:08.752
You know that long line of trembling
peons that are so afraid of you?

17:08.839 --> 17:10.751
- I'm not in that line.
- You're not?

17:10.839 --> 17:13.434
No. I'm not in anybody's line.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.751
- This is a Chiclet.
- I gotta go.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.871
<i>I'm happy when someone wins a battle,</i>

17:27.960 --> 17:31.794
<i>because around here you get</i>
<i>your fair share of disappointment.</i>

18:06.160 --> 18:08.674
<i>You have to fight</i>
<i>for things that really matter.</i>

18:08.760 --> 18:10.955
<i>Like pride in your work.</i>

18:12.720 --> 18:14.597
<i>Or your friendship.</i>

18:14.680 --> 18:16.557
I'm starting to like Journey.

18:16.640 --> 18:20.519
You're gonna be very pleased
with the next 23 songs.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.717
The fact that
you're even here is enough.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.756
We don't have to get all deep.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.752
I wanna try this, man.

18:28.840 --> 18:35.075
OK. Ever since Carla and I set the date
for our wedding, I started thinking.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.037
You know those lame-ass couples

18:37.120 --> 18:40.032
that get engaged
but they never actually get married,

18:40.120 --> 18:44.477
they just cruise along year after year
without making any real commitment?

18:44.560 --> 18:47.233
Dude, I wanted to be
one of those couples, man.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.431
Pookie, can we get two apple-tinis?

18:50.520 --> 18:53.751
<i>Sometimes all you can do</i>
<i>is grit your teeth and tell the truth.</i>

18:55.280 --> 18:59.319
I was planning on telling you
that you'll always come first,

18:59.400 --> 19:02.676
but the truth is
that's not a promise that I can keep.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.790
But I can guarantee you that when it's
my decision, I'll always choose you.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.838
But if that's not enough, I understand.
