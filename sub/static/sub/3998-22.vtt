WEBVTT

00:01.225 --> 00:03.077
Thanks for helping me
with my school dance.

00:06.489 --> 00:11.036
"Love is forever,
and ever, and ever, and..."

00:11.304 --> 00:14.937
- How many "and ever"s?
- Technically infinity, but...

00:14.997 --> 00:16.517
I could only fit 12.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.147
Well, this is going to be
tough for you, huh?

00:20.182 --> 00:22.443
Yes! Foster said
we couldn't afford it,

00:22.444 --> 00:24.450
but I really stuck my neck out
for this dance.

00:24.460 --> 00:28.567
No, I-I mean because the theme
of the dance is "Love is forever" and...

00:28.737 --> 00:30.777
Nick, and the breakup...

00:30.956 --> 00:34.481
What? No, Cece, look, you remember
what school dances were like for me.

00:34.671 --> 00:36.573
They were miserable.
I was just waiting in the bathroom

00:36.746 --> 00:39.505
for *** to magically appear
and ask me out.

00:39.506 --> 00:42.256
I remember. I was smoking
in the stall next to you.

00:42.257 --> 00:44.129
We get it, you were bad.

00:44.164 --> 00:46.591
I just don't want it to be
like it was for me.

00:46.773 --> 00:50.451
I want them to have an incredible time.
My life is a bit of a mess right now,

00:50.767 --> 00:55.083
but the one thing I can do
is throw an amazing dance for them.

00:55.260 --> 00:58.263
"Love is forever,
and ever, and ever..."

00:58.434 --> 01:01.719
- What is this?
- The theme of Jess's school dance.

01:01.887 --> 01:03.245
- It's pretty ironic, huh?
- Jess, you poor thing.

01:03.246 --> 01:04.438
- Come-come here. Come here.
- What?

01:04.474 --> 01:05.336
What?

01:05.370 --> 01:06.604
Just... there.

01:06.638 --> 01:07.839
- What are you doing?
- All right.

01:07.873 --> 01:10.174
Uh-huh. Okay.

01:10.209 --> 01:11.709
Oh, I know. I know.

01:11.744 --> 01:13.878
- I know.
- What's happening?

01:13.912 --> 01:15.780
I got hug number two
locked and loaded.

01:15.814 --> 01:17.949
Soft or hard, it's up to you.

01:17.983 --> 01:19.384
- I know.
- Schmidt...

Synced and corrected by backinblack

01:29.828 --> 01:31.496
Ay-ay-ay, I needed a shvitz.

01:31.530 --> 01:33.089
Ech, me, too.

01:33.277 --> 01:36.012
My arms are so sore
from doing so many push-ups.

01:36.358 --> 01:37.215
That seems like a lie.

01:37.216 --> 01:39.000
No, I'm trying to stay fit
after the breakup.

01:39.177 --> 01:42.027
I've been eating salads,
yeah, no dressing,

01:42.201 --> 01:44.776
- mostly just the protein.
- What kind of salad you've been eating?

01:44.935 --> 01:47.789
- The little chopped of pieces of ham.
- Just the ham?

01:47.969 --> 01:48.826
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.803
I don't like the lettuce. I think it's
gross to eat stuff on earth that's green.

01:51.949 --> 01:53.383
- Well, look, you know baby steps...
- Not baby steps,

01:53.531 --> 01:55.367
- there were some pretty big pieces of ham.
- Okay.

01:55.402 --> 01:59.742
It's still not as good.
I genuinely miss goofing around with Jess.

01:59.905 --> 02:01.970
Breakups aren't
supposed to be easy, so...

02:02.151 --> 02:03.633
Well, it's really mature of you, man.

02:03.635 --> 02:04.623
We're doing something where we are...

02:04.803 --> 02:08.173
we are not allowed to be in the room
alone together without Winston.

02:08.485 --> 02:11.140
'Cause he just naturally takes
the sexual tension out of a room.

02:14.478 --> 02:16.179
What'd you guys want?

02:16.213 --> 02:17.914
You see? I'm proud of you.

02:17.948 --> 02:19.415
That's what I'm talking
about. We're men.

02:19.450 --> 02:20.683
We've felt pain, we've survived it.

02:20.717 --> 02:22.218
Look at me.

02:22.252 --> 02:23.686
I'm watching Cece drool
over some 20-year-old.

02:23.720 --> 02:25.788
How could she be interested in a boy

02:25.823 --> 02:27.290
when she could have these ripe berries?

02:27.324 --> 02:28.591
Look at these, Nick.

02:28.625 --> 02:29.859
Put your towel down.

02:29.893 --> 02:32.128
Oh, God, I need a shvitz.

02:32.162 --> 02:34.697
Why does my sweat smell like asparagus?

02:34.731 --> 02:36.699
He does take all the sexual tension
out of a room.

02:36.733 --> 02:38.634
Man, I heat up every room I walk into.

02:38.669 --> 02:41.604
Put me next to a dozen eggs.
They hatching. You know why?

02:41.639 --> 02:43.373
'Cause I got the heat of a mother hen.

02:43.407 --> 02:45.241
There was no sexual tension
in here before he got here.

02:45.276 --> 02:46.342
Keep telling yourself that, Nick.

02:47.678 --> 02:49.379
Congrats, chaperones!

02:49.413 --> 02:50.780
With your help, tonight
is going to be...

02:50.814 --> 02:52.048
unforgettable.

02:52.082 --> 02:53.416
I didn't sign up for this.

02:53.450 --> 02:55.318
No, you didn't. None of you did.

02:55.352 --> 02:56.986
In fact, none of you have ever, ever

02:57.021 --> 02:59.222
signed up for any school event, ever.

02:59.256 --> 03:01.758
Which means you've never felt the joy

03:01.792 --> 03:03.159
of exchanging your free time

03:03.193 --> 03:04.827
for a child's smile.

03:04.862 --> 03:07.297
I never volunteer because
of my Munchausen syndrome.

03:07.331 --> 03:08.264
Are we getting paid?

03:08.299 --> 03:09.666
You will get paid, um, actually,

03:09.700 --> 03:12.569
in attractive hats that I made.

03:12.603 --> 03:14.604
They say "chaperone."

03:15.706 --> 03:16.773
And Gary the Janitor has one

03:16.807 --> 03:17.907
that says "clean up crew."

03:17.942 --> 03:19.576
You call me Gary the Janitor

03:19.610 --> 03:21.477
as if me being a janitor

03:21.512 --> 03:22.745
is my whole identity.

03:22.780 --> 03:24.314
It's like someone calling you

03:24.348 --> 03:26.816
Jess the Third-Hottest White Teacher.

03:26.850 --> 03:27.817
Okay.

03:27.851 --> 03:28.818
Are we done?

03:28.852 --> 03:29.819
I'm gonna say we're done.

03:29.853 --> 03:31.287
Yeah. Okay.

03:31.322 --> 03:32.989
Thank-thanks, guys.
Good-good meeting.

03:33.023 --> 03:35.258
I don't know
where I'm supposed to be right now.

03:35.292 --> 03:36.626
Thanks, guys.

03:36.660 --> 03:38.595
It's gonna be great!

03:38.629 --> 03:40.663
You don't have to wear that, Coach.

03:40.698 --> 03:41.931
As far as I'm concerned,

03:41.966 --> 03:43.166
this dance starts now.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.134
I know how important
this dance is to you.

03:45.169 --> 03:46.893
Those kids won't get away with anything.

03:47.071 --> 03:49.808
They want to bang, they're gonna
have to bang through me.

03:49.842 --> 03:50.842
Wait.

03:51.711 --> 03:53.178
If they want to bang,

03:53.212 --> 03:55.147
they're gonna have to bang through me!

03:55.181 --> 03:56.515
Wait.

03:57.550 --> 03:58.984
Hey, Wendy.

04:00.186 --> 04:01.520
Whoa!

04:01.554 --> 04:04.222
That shirt's scary! Whoa.

04:06.859 --> 04:08.059
You going to the dance tonight?

04:08.094 --> 04:09.294
My mom's making me go.

04:09.328 --> 04:10.529
Making you go

04:10.563 --> 04:12.130
to the best night of your life?

04:12.165 --> 04:13.865
Your mom sounds really cool.

04:13.900 --> 04:17.101
Come one, at your age, love
is forever and ever and ever.

04:18.504 --> 04:19.704
What are you gonna wear?

04:19.738 --> 04:20.738
This shirt.

04:20.773 --> 04:21.839
Oh.

04:21.874 --> 04:23.075
Oh!

04:23.109 --> 04:24.476
That is

04:24.510 --> 04:26.945
the best idea I've heard all week.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.315
Whoa! Scary shirt!

04:30.349 --> 04:31.716
We all think that you're an idiot

04:31.751 --> 04:32.984
for dating this 14-year-old.

04:33.019 --> 04:34.219
He's 20.

04:34.253 --> 04:35.487
That means he was seven

04:35.521 --> 04:36.855
when Good Will Hunting came out.

04:36.889 --> 04:38.523
Seven, Cece.
Good Will Hunting.

04:38.558 --> 04:40.192
You know what? Let me go,
let me go, let me go.

04:40.226 --> 04:42.094
Um, check this out.
Cece's boyfriend

04:42.128 --> 04:45.764
is so young that...

04:45.798 --> 04:47.866
It'll come back to me.

04:47.900 --> 04:49.534
Buster is more of a man than all of you.

04:49.569 --> 04:51.603
Okay? He's been to, like, 40 countries,

04:51.637 --> 04:53.038
he builds boats,

04:53.072 --> 04:54.578
he used to train snakes with his uncle.

04:54.608 --> 04:56.171
Earning a respectable wage,

04:56.274 --> 04:58.509
wearing a proper-hanging
pair of slacks,

04:58.543 --> 05:01.011
ordering sushi like a sick-ass boss...

05:01.046 --> 05:04.365
- These things a man maketh.
- So stupid stuff that you do.

05:04.549 --> 05:06.301
I know that technically
you guys are men,

05:06.341 --> 05:09.733
but all you do is hang out
with each other, like you're 12.

05:09.901 --> 05:11.221
What do you know?
You're just a stupid girl.

05:11.256 --> 05:13.057
Okay, I got it, I got it.

05:13.091 --> 05:16.126
Okay, Cece's boyfriend
is so young that...

05:16.161 --> 05:18.629
- How-how young is he?
- Winston.

05:18.663 --> 05:20.898
It's not working, man.
I'm serious.

05:20.932 --> 05:23.567
- I'm at my wit's end with you.
- What?

05:23.601 --> 05:25.035
Wait a minute.

05:25.070 --> 05:26.770
Why's the door locked?

05:26.805 --> 05:28.539
The dance starts in five minutes.

05:28.573 --> 05:30.474
- Okay.
- Gary!

05:30.508 --> 05:32.376
Thank God you're here.
Can you unlock the door?

05:32.410 --> 05:34.211
No. I didn't put that there.

05:34.245 --> 05:35.379
What?

05:35.413 --> 05:36.714
Who else could have done it?

05:36.748 --> 05:37.948
We can't start the dance

05:37.982 --> 05:39.316
if the door's locked.

05:39.351 --> 05:41.151
Don't tell me I wore my raw denim

05:41.186 --> 05:43.921
for no reason.
Don't you dare tell me that!

05:43.955 --> 05:44.922
I am not telling you that.

05:44.956 --> 05:46.423
So the dance is cancelled, then?

05:46.458 --> 05:47.624
No, no, no. There is gonna be a dance.

05:47.659 --> 05:48.625
It's gonna be great and perfect

05:48.660 --> 05:49.927
and lovely and it will celebrate

05:49.961 --> 05:51.395
love is forever and ever and ever.

05:51.429 --> 05:52.496
Where are you guys going?

05:52.530 --> 05:54.431
In life, nowhere.

05:54.466 --> 05:56.600
But I know I don't want to be here.

05:56.634 --> 05:59.470
Guys, please stay. It would
really mean a lot to me.

05:59.504 --> 06:00.671
Boring.

06:02.007 --> 06:04.174
It's Jess. All of her
chaperones just bailed,

06:04.209 --> 06:05.642
and she needs help.

06:05.677 --> 06:06.744
A lady needs help?

06:06.778 --> 06:08.812
Is that a job for a boy?

06:08.847 --> 06:09.813
- No.
- Or a...

06:09.848 --> 06:11.148
- Man!
- man?

06:11.182 --> 06:13.484
Men! Men! Men!

06:13.518 --> 06:16.420
Men! Men! Men! Men! Men!

06:16.454 --> 06:17.855
Well, the dummy patrol is ready.

06:17.889 --> 06:19.590
- Men! Men! Men!
- Aah!

06:19.624 --> 06:21.458
Men. Man!

06:21.493 --> 06:23.794
- So stupid.
- Seriously, are you okay for real?

06:23.828 --> 06:26.096
- You got any ice?
- Dude, rub his shoulder. Rub his shoulder.

06:26.131 --> 06:28.098
- I'll get ice. I'll get ice.
- My shoulder go into his. You all right?

06:28.133 --> 06:30.134
- Ow, man!
- Okay, all right, just sit back.

06:30.168 --> 06:32.036
Nick, get the ice!

06:34.519 --> 06:37.820
- How do you know how to do that?
- Well, a tire iron is

06:37.854 --> 06:40.589
actually strong enough to break through
a high-carbon steel steering wheel lock,

06:40.624 --> 06:42.558
so, you ow, I figured
I'd work with this.

06:42.592 --> 06:43.959
Cece scares me sometimes.

06:43.994 --> 06:45.561
It's just the tip
of the iceberg, my friend.

06:45.595 --> 06:50.445
- Got it. There we go.
- Oh! Yes!

06:50.479 --> 06:52.881
Everything's back on track, guys!

06:52.915 --> 06:54.883
This bike lock was a real punk move.

06:54.917 --> 06:57.652
Seems like there's a lot of
punks here. Did you do this?

06:57.686 --> 07:00.722
- Hey. You did this? Huh? You did this?
- Hey, easy, easy.

07:00.756 --> 07:02.457
If anyone's messing
with this dance, it's one

07:02.491 --> 07:04.826
of those teachers...
Those hats were begging for payback.

07:04.860 --> 07:05.793
- Let's do this.
- Hey.

07:05.828 --> 07:07.795
Listen up, chaperones.

07:07.830 --> 07:09.330
You will obey all of my instructions.

07:09.365 --> 07:11.332
This means everything to Jess.

07:11.367 --> 07:13.234
Your asses belong to me now.

07:13.269 --> 07:14.936
Which means I currently have

07:14.970 --> 07:16.437
four asses.

07:16.472 --> 07:19.007
The three of yours and mine.

07:19.041 --> 07:20.175
I think we're capable of handling

07:20.209 --> 07:22.177
a bunch of prepubescent kids.

07:22.211 --> 07:24.012
Do you think you are tough, Winston?

07:24.046 --> 07:25.013
You have no idea

07:25.047 --> 07:26.447
what these little bastards

07:26.482 --> 07:27.615
are capable of.

07:27.650 --> 07:28.783
I mean, I love them.

07:28.817 --> 07:30.318
I love them with all my heart.

07:30.806 --> 07:34.601
But they will hurt
your feelings sometimes.

07:35.430 --> 07:38.293
He's right. I remember sticks and
stones may break your bones,

07:38.327 --> 07:41.329
but not if you're a fat
kid with calcium deficiency.

07:41.363 --> 07:44.365
Schmidt, you're on snack table
duty. Keep the chip bowls full.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.767
Don't let the kids spike the punch.

07:45.801 --> 07:47.001
And make sure Diabetic Amy

07:47.036 --> 07:49.037
only has four cookies.

07:49.071 --> 07:51.940
Diabetic Amy ain't gonna
get no cookies on my watch.

07:51.974 --> 07:54.175
No, she-she has to have
at least two or she'll pass out.

07:54.210 --> 07:55.844
She's getting nothing
as far as I'm concerned.

07:55.878 --> 07:58.012
At least two, at least two
or she'll pass out.

07:58.047 --> 08:00.548
- All right, Winston? Dance floor duty.
- Yes, sir.

08:00.583 --> 08:02.617
Ooh, you shouldn't have
said that, man, that is

08:02.651 --> 08:03.685
the perfect place for
me right now. I got

08:03.719 --> 08:05.053
- so much heat coming off me, man.
- No.

08:05.087 --> 08:06.888
No, no, no, no, no, no. No heat.

08:06.922 --> 08:08.323
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- No heat. Hey, hey, hey.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.391
None. Hey, look at me. No heat.

08:10.426 --> 08:13.328
The opposite of heat. Six inches
separation at all times.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.530
Nobody's getting pregnant tonight.

08:15.564 --> 08:17.632
That's the same thing I say on my dates.

08:17.666 --> 08:20.201
Not cool.

08:21.503 --> 08:23.538
- Let's hit it.
- Hey, hey.

08:23.572 --> 08:25.240
Saving the best for last?

08:25.274 --> 08:26.741
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick, uh,

08:26.775 --> 08:28.209
you're not chaperone material.

08:28.244 --> 08:30.345
I've been at this job
for a few weeks now

08:30.379 --> 08:32.246
and I know the stink of a bad kid.

08:32.280 --> 08:35.203
That makes me the perfect
candidate to be a chaperone, Coach.

08:35.243 --> 08:36.351
Just think about it.

08:36.385 --> 08:39.053
I can get in the mind of a bad kid.

08:39.054 --> 08:41.655
Think like 'em, go deep.
I can go too deep.

08:41.690 --> 08:43.991
I'm gonna put you in the parking lot
to sweep for stragglers.

08:44.025 --> 08:46.094
- You want me on the streets.
- It's not that important of a job.

08:48.063 --> 08:50.064
I won't let you down.

08:50.099 --> 08:52.100
I'm not gonna let you down!

08:54.770 --> 08:57.105
You taking a... a break right now?

08:59.000 --> 09:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here

09:09.218 --> 09:10.718
When the heat moves
you, you got to move...

09:10.753 --> 09:12.220
Okay, no heat. No heat.

09:12.254 --> 09:14.122
No heat, Bishop, no heat.

09:14.156 --> 09:15.623
Keep that heat locked up.

09:15.658 --> 09:17.559
Keep that heat...

09:17.593 --> 09:19.894
Think you're going, baby

09:19.929 --> 09:22.063
I, this is...

09:22.097 --> 09:23.398
Crazy.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.033
Put that heat away, Bishop.

09:25.067 --> 09:27.468
Huh? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You got that, man.

09:27.503 --> 09:28.770
You got...

09:30.172 --> 09:31.639
What are you looking at?

09:31.674 --> 09:34.142
Cool mustache.

09:35.411 --> 09:37.612
Too much heat.

09:37.646 --> 09:39.647
Too much heat.

09:39.682 --> 09:41.749
All right, kids, let's
use the serving tongs.

09:41.784 --> 09:43.318
This isn't Appalachia.

09:43.352 --> 09:46.354
Hurry up, everybody,
before Justin eats everything.

09:48.591 --> 09:50.091
Son, I...

09:50.125 --> 09:51.159
don't think you meant to hurt

09:51.193 --> 09:52.894
Justin's feelings, there.

09:52.928 --> 09:55.230
What's going on, really?

09:55.264 --> 09:57.131
Are the parents fighting at home?

09:57.166 --> 09:58.333
Leave me alone, flamer.

09:58.367 --> 10:00.468
Flamer?

10:00.503 --> 10:01.970
You're the... You're the flamer, pal.

10:02.004 --> 10:04.105
- You're the flamer.
- You're the flamer.

10:04.139 --> 10:05.907
- Flamer.
- Stop saying that word, it's probably

10:05.941 --> 10:07.642
- offensive to some people, you flamer.
- Flamer, flamer.

10:07.676 --> 10:09.511
- Yeah, take a doughnut, there, you flamer.
- Flamer.

10:09.545 --> 10:12.013
Schmidt. I got a bit
of a situation here.

10:12.047 --> 10:14.749
Um, thoughts? Advice?

10:14.783 --> 10:16.084
What now?

10:16.118 --> 10:19.687
Aw, son of a b... penis.

10:19.722 --> 10:21.523
Ah, that wasn't better.

10:21.557 --> 10:23.291
Sorry, everyone.

10:23.325 --> 10:24.993
You were right.

10:25.027 --> 10:27.495
Someone's trying to mess with my dance.

10:27.530 --> 10:29.797
Hmm. It's paste.

10:29.832 --> 10:31.166
And it's fresh.

10:35.371 --> 10:38.239
Banana in the dark.

10:40.910 --> 10:42.977
Uh-oh.

10:43.012 --> 10:45.439
You ruined my dance.
I can smell the paste.

10:46.048 --> 10:47.244
Perpetrator!

10:50.299 --> 10:51.700
He's in there.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.702
Okay, when we get in there,

10:53.736 --> 10:56.004
I'm going to be good cop,
you be bad cop, okay?

10:56.038 --> 10:58.940
Got it.

10:58.975 --> 11:00.308
There are two ways this can go.

11:00.343 --> 11:01.710
Number one:

11:01.744 --> 11:04.045
you tell us why you ruined the dance.

11:04.080 --> 11:08.483
Number two: I bash
your skull in with a carburetor!

11:09.819 --> 11:11.987
- I thought I was bad cop.
- You are the bad cop.

11:12.021 --> 11:15.123
I'm the tough, competent cop,
who's good at her job,

11:15.158 --> 11:17.359
you're the kind of fumbly, dumb cop

11:17.393 --> 11:19.966
- who's nice and...
- Yeah, that's not how it works, though.

11:20.116 --> 11:21.994
I mean, the good cop is nice
and the bad cop is mean.

11:22.044 --> 11:23.398
- That would be nice cop, mean cop.
- It's how it works

11:23.432 --> 11:26.334
- on every cop show, when you watch it.
- I watch cop shows.

11:26.369 --> 11:28.069
- You need to pay more attention.
- I do pay attention...

11:28.104 --> 11:31.840
- What do you awful women want?
- We want to know...

11:31.874 --> 11:35.644
why you locked the door and
poured glue in the breaker.

11:35.678 --> 11:37.179
I didn't do any of that.

11:37.213 --> 11:39.881
Why would anybody

11:39.916 --> 11:41.917
want to ruin such a magical night?

11:41.951 --> 11:45.454
Uh, you're the only one who
wanted to have this stupid dance.

11:45.488 --> 11:46.955
Revenge would be my guess.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.591
What do you know?

11:49.625 --> 11:52.360
Well, you have the grip
of a much taller woman.

11:52.395 --> 11:55.597
And I don't not like that.

11:55.631 --> 11:56.898
Ugh.

12:00.703 --> 12:01.770
...some fireworks or something.

12:03.773 --> 12:05.207
What's up, gentlemen?

12:05.241 --> 12:07.108
Just hanging out outside
in the parking lot?

12:07.143 --> 12:09.110
We're not doing anything.
We don't need a chaperone.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.746
Calling me a 'rone?

12:11.781 --> 12:15.584
I'm not a 'rone. I'm
basically the same guy as you.

12:15.618 --> 12:17.719
We're wearing the same shirt.

12:17.753 --> 12:20.789
I'm a good guy, I'm
having fun. I'm just...

12:20.823 --> 12:22.691
I'm bored in there,
I'm looking to hang out.

12:22.725 --> 12:24.493
Is that a crime, officers?

12:25.661 --> 12:27.362
Say, you guys got any Billy Whizz?

12:27.396 --> 12:30.265
Any juice, any sweet
Mary Jane? I'm looking.

12:30.299 --> 12:32.434
Okay, if you're really
not a chaperone...

12:32.468 --> 12:34.536
why don't you take a sip of this?

12:34.570 --> 12:37.439
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
I got nothing to prove.

12:37.473 --> 12:38.640
Are you a 'rone or not?

12:38.674 --> 12:40.942
Give me that.

12:51.654 --> 12:54.456
What is that? Is that a suicide?

12:54.458 --> 12:56.958
- The soda flavors all mix together.
- You know it, bro.

12:56.993 --> 12:59.728
That was super intense.

12:59.762 --> 13:01.463
Sorry, I spit some of it up.

13:01.497 --> 13:02.931
He's cool.

13:09.806 --> 13:11.440
Hey, buddy, uh,

13:11.474 --> 13:14.509
Tommy, is it? I just...
I just wanted to apologize

13:14.544 --> 13:16.178
for what happened before, kiddo.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.246
What, are you gonna propose to me, now?

13:21.884 --> 13:23.785
That's funny. No, I... I
get it. You know, when I...

13:23.820 --> 13:26.855
when I was young, I too found
that humor can be a useful tool.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.490
Dude, get up, I'm not gonna marry you.

13:30.793 --> 13:32.794
I,, found that humor can be a...

13:32.829 --> 13:34.129
...a useful tool.

13:34.163 --> 13:36.198
And then you grow up
and you become a man.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.266
Well, you smell like a woman.

13:38.301 --> 13:40.035
That's it, enough is enough with you.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.370
You think you're a tough guy, tough guy?

13:42.405 --> 13:43.972
Prove it, man.

13:44.006 --> 13:45.440
Name the time and place.

13:45.475 --> 13:47.642
15 minutes. Parking lot.

13:47.677 --> 13:49.111
- Fist fight?
- Foot race.

13:49.145 --> 13:50.946
- A what?
- Yeah,

13:50.980 --> 13:52.814
you heard me...
foot race, man.

13:52.849 --> 13:55.750
I'll run circles around
you and all your pals.

14:00.323 --> 14:03.458
Oh. You girls are
multiplying like bunnies.

14:03.493 --> 14:05.260
That's weird.

14:05.294 --> 14:07.796
Lot more of you than there is of me.

14:13.669 --> 14:15.137
We should lock all the doors.

14:15.171 --> 14:17.072
No one gets in, no one gets out.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.174
The culprit's inside.
It's frickin' Gosford Park!

14:19.208 --> 14:21.042
You need to just calm
down a little, Jess.

14:21.077 --> 14:24.379
I can't calm down!
I want this to be perfect.

14:24.413 --> 14:26.348
I know, but it's too
late for that, okay?

14:26.382 --> 14:27.983
There are kids doing
their homework in there.

14:28.017 --> 14:29.251
It's bleak.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.685
I know after what happened with Nick

14:30.720 --> 14:33.321
you wanted this to go great, but

14:33.356 --> 14:35.991
it's not your fault that the
dance got messed up, all right?

14:36.025 --> 14:38.266
You'll get 'em next time.

14:38.300 --> 14:39.834
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

14:39.868 --> 14:41.536
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

14:41.570 --> 14:45.273
Oh, that was a sugar rush, man.
That's a buzz in the brain!

14:46.541 --> 14:49.410
Ooh, ooh!

14:49.444 --> 14:51.779
You guys see how high I just got?

14:56.285 --> 14:57.785
I'm good.

14:57.819 --> 14:59.287
He ain't a 'rone. Too dumb.

14:59.321 --> 15:01.389
Aw, this is fun, man! I miss this!

15:01.423 --> 15:02.957
I really do, man. Let's keep going.

15:02.991 --> 15:04.926
Let's get burgers. Meet some girls.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.794
Different ages, man. It's so early!

15:06.828 --> 15:09.931
Hey, we got something to show you.

15:12.968 --> 15:15.236
Look, guys, we had a lot of fun, but...

15:15.270 --> 15:18.873
we can get in a lot of
trouble for doing this.

15:18.907 --> 15:22.944
Which is why you gotta run
really fast when it goes off.

15:22.978 --> 15:23.711
Like now!

15:23.745 --> 15:25.446
- Oh, dude!
- Go! I mean it! Go!

15:28.584 --> 15:30.284
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah!

15:30.319 --> 15:31.919
Yeah!

15:31.954 --> 15:33.955
What are we gonna do now?

15:35.691 --> 15:36.691
Let's ride.

15:36.725 --> 15:37.792
Oh, hell yeah!

15:41.029 --> 15:42.063
Wendy?

15:42.097 --> 15:44.465
Busted.

15:51.128 --> 15:52.495
Well, you really did
come prepared, Wendy.

15:52.529 --> 15:54.230
A wrench...

15:54.264 --> 15:57.500
some glue...

15:57.534 --> 15:59.902
a box of tampons?

15:59.937 --> 16:01.504
What were you gonna do with this?

16:01.538 --> 16:02.538
Um...

16:02.573 --> 16:04.907
Oh. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

16:06.377 --> 16:08.745
So you really didn't
want the dance to happen?

16:08.779 --> 16:10.747
None of the boys want to dance with me.

16:10.781 --> 16:12.048
Jess?

16:12.082 --> 16:13.016
Hey, Cece.

16:13.050 --> 16:14.684
Hey. This is Wendy.

16:14.718 --> 16:16.019
She was just telling
me how she doesn't like

16:16.053 --> 16:17.253
to dance with boys.

16:18.389 --> 16:21.691
Oh.

16:21.725 --> 16:25.695
Yeah. Well... that makes sense

16:25.729 --> 16:27.864
because boys are the dumbest.

16:27.898 --> 16:29.065
You're just saying that.

16:29.099 --> 16:30.366
No. No, no. No.

16:30.401 --> 16:32.769
Cece and I have met so many boys,

16:32.803 --> 16:34.270
and they are all so dumb.

16:34.305 --> 16:36.606
Yeah, and I've met more than her, so...

16:36.640 --> 16:39.375
Yeah, and Cece has met more
than me because she is...

16:39.410 --> 16:41.210
nicer than me.

16:41.245 --> 16:43.546
- Nicer?
- I just mean you've met...

16:43.580 --> 16:45.248
'cause you're well-traveled.

16:45.282 --> 16:47.884
- "Well-traveled" is how we're gonna say it?
- I mean...

16:47.918 --> 16:49.552
- You better tread lightly.
- I will... Travel...

16:49.586 --> 16:50.787
You travel a lot.

16:50.821 --> 16:53.056
Mm-hmm.

16:53.090 --> 16:55.291
I don't think I'm ever
gonna dance with a boy.

16:55.326 --> 16:58.127
Listen, are boys dumb?

16:58.162 --> 17:01.464
Yes. Yes!

17:01.498 --> 17:05.300
Do they do disappointing,
stupid, stupid things

17:05.336 --> 17:09.806
that really...
hurt your feelings? Yes.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.775
Sometimes things don't work
out the way you plan them...

17:12.810 --> 17:15.645
actually, they never work
out the way you plan them...

17:15.679 --> 17:19.415
but, in the end, it's all worth it,

17:19.450 --> 17:23.019
and that's why you have to try.

17:26.357 --> 17:28.057
Are you talking about sex or dancing?

17:28.092 --> 17:30.059
- Dancing.
- Dancing. Oh, God. Dancing, dancing.

17:30.094 --> 17:31.561
- We're talking about dancing.
- Upright dancing.

17:31.595 --> 17:33.796
Okay. I'll try.

17:33.831 --> 17:35.231
So let's get back out there.

17:35.265 --> 17:36.599
Oh, Cece, it's okay.

17:36.634 --> 17:38.401
There's no light, no music.

17:38.435 --> 17:39.669
The dance is over.

17:39.703 --> 17:41.337
Oh, no, this dance is not over.

17:41.372 --> 17:45.375
We just need to find some stupid boys.

17:46.677 --> 17:48.244
You look so slow.

17:48.279 --> 17:49.345
Like a s... like a s...

17:49.380 --> 17:51.781
super... dumb, slow turtle.

17:51.815 --> 17:53.816
- I'm so fast, and you're so old.
- So much like a...

17:53.851 --> 17:55.952
like a turtle, it's crazy to me.

17:55.986 --> 17:57.153
Are we gonna do this or what?

17:57.187 --> 17:58.254
Oh, yeah, we're gonna do this.

17:58.289 --> 18:00.323
I'm like a Hebrew cheetah.
