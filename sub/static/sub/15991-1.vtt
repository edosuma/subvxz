01:29.215 --> 01:31.968
Maybe things will go right this time.

01:32.552 --> 01:34.053
That's what I like about you.

01:35.513 --> 01:37.432
Bright-sider.

01:47.442 --> 01:51.654
Well, at least we have the vaccine
Two Horns wants. We're almost done.

01:51.821 --> 01:55.325
"Almost" and "done," not the same thing.

01:55.491 --> 01:56.993
Yeah, but when we are done...

01:57.160 --> 02:00.830
...then no more work for the city's
slimiest crime boss, right?

02:00.997 --> 02:03.374
I mean, if all goes to plan.

02:03.833 --> 02:06.878
If all goes to plan, we can talk about it later.

02:07.045 --> 02:09.172
We're not out of here yet.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.799
I'll take a look around.

02:38.284 --> 02:39.535
What is it?

02:40.953 --> 02:42.413
Nothing.

02:43.206 --> 02:44.332
It must be nothing.

03:00.306 --> 03:02.308
- Deunan?
- Yeah, I'm good.

03:02.475 --> 03:04.894
- And the vaccine?
- Safe.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.367
The subway was a bad idea.

03:19.534 --> 03:22.829
I know. And it's not even rush hour.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.505
- Two?
- Three. All cyborgs.

03:32.672 --> 03:33.715
Any ideas?

03:34.257 --> 03:36.551
No. You?

03:36.718 --> 03:39.887
No. How could you miss
three guys out there?

03:40.054 --> 03:44.892
- Bri, if you're having power problems
- Not now. They're coming.

04:33.858 --> 04:36.235
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed girl, would you?

04:42.283 --> 04:43.326
Amateur.

04:53.628 --> 04:54.921
Use enough bullets?

04:55.463 --> 04:57.048
Yeah, I know.

04:57.215 --> 04:59.842
But you know who didn't use any?

05:00.051 --> 05:02.553
- Them.
- Let's get this train moving again.

05:05.056 --> 05:06.766
It's done. Let's go.

05:06.933 --> 05:08.601
Got it.

05:23.783 --> 05:27.787
- What the hell happened to our driver?
- He's not our driver, it was a setup.

05:27.954 --> 05:30.832
- Ambush.
- You think?

05:35.920 --> 05:37.713
- Damn it.
- What is it?

05:39.173 --> 05:40.675
The end of the line.

05:40.842 --> 05:42.134
Get down.

06:19.130 --> 06:23.843
- What did you mean by "setup"?
- Only one person knew why we were here.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.637
How is it?

06:29.140 --> 06:30.975
NO good?

06:31.142 --> 06:32.810
No.

06:41.861 --> 06:44.280
Looks like this is our stop.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.414
Thanks.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.499
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

06:58.586 --> 07:01.464
You may be a damn good cyborg...

07:02.381 --> 07:04.550
...but you're not a robot.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.952
Didn't go to plan, Bri.

07:31.118 --> 07:34.288
Nope. Definitely not to plan.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.418
<i>The beginning of</i> a <i>new world is here.</i>

07:39.585 --> 07:42.964
<i>Victory is ours. We won. We won.</i>

07:43.130 --> 07:45.675
What idiot is still airing these commercials?

07:45.841 --> 07:49.303
The same idiot who provides
the electricity to run this city.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.472
Run this city? Seriously?

07:51.639 --> 07:55.977
Well, maybe "run" is a little generous.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.396
But what we have is better than nothing.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.773
That's debatable.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.693
Time to see Two Horns.

08:03.859 --> 08:07.571
Really? Considering we just failed
the mission he gave us...

08:07.738 --> 08:10.199
...do you really think
that's such a good idea?

08:10.366 --> 08:14.578
If we don't go see him, he'll think
we took off with the damn vaccine.

08:16.622 --> 08:19.041
Maybe we forget what we owe Two Horns.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.669
Maybe we take what we have and get out of here.

08:21.836 --> 08:23.337
And go where?

08:23.504 --> 08:25.214
I don't know.

08:26.465 --> 08:27.800
Olympus?

08:28.676 --> 08:33.431
Not that again. You really still think
it's out there, don't you?

08:33.597 --> 08:35.683
I don't know. Maybe.

08:36.976 --> 08:39.687
Everything here just seems so pointless.

08:40.604 --> 08:45.109
Deunan, we fought in a world war
and at the end of it all, who won?

08:45.276 --> 08:46.944
Who won?

08:47.111 --> 08:50.948
No one, that's who. It is pointless.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.326
I know.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.662
I know you sacrificed a lot.

08:58.247 --> 09:01.959
We clear our debt to Two Horns.
Come on.

09:03.627 --> 09:06.589
You do like to clear your debts.

09:12.053 --> 09:14.638
- Who is it?
- Open the door.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.602
Yeah, we know the drill.

09:21.479 --> 09:23.981
Don't worry, I left my toys at home.

09:24.148 --> 09:26.442
- She's clean.
- Told you.

09:26.609 --> 09:28.944
Boss is waiting. Go on up.

09:33.032 --> 09:37.411
Why aren't we keeping him down here?
He's a cyborg. He's a walking weapon.

09:37.578 --> 09:38.871
Yeah, but look at him.

09:40.498 --> 09:43.709
Unless he gets some juice soon, he's a goner.

09:44.835 --> 09:46.712
Are you sure you're up to this?

09:46.879 --> 09:48.839
I'm fine.

10:13.072 --> 10:15.241
You're looking well. And you're late.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.750
- So late that I had a lot of time to think.
- Did it hurt?

10:24.917 --> 10:29.338
You wanna know what I thought about?
I thought you took off with my shit.

10:29.839 --> 10:33.634
So come on, give me the vaccine.
Now.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.178
Maybe you should ask one of your goons for it.

10:36.345 --> 10:39.765
You know there's still a leash law for junkyard dogs.

10:39.932 --> 10:42.184
We don't have the vaccine.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.103
What?

10:44.270 --> 10:45.896
What the hell happened?

10:46.063 --> 10:48.566
We ran into some complications.

10:48.732 --> 10:51.485
But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?

10:51.652 --> 10:53.195
I thought you were the best.

10:53.362 --> 10:56.824
Don't I pay you to take care of complications?

10:56.991 --> 11:01.453
If you don't like us, you can always use
the A-Team you got here.

11:01.620 --> 11:04.123
We'll find jobs elsewhere.

11:08.627 --> 11:12.047
We still have the little matter of your debt.

11:13.174 --> 11:15.509
I've worked enough to pay you back.

11:16.385 --> 11:17.595
Are you joking?

11:22.057 --> 11:24.476
Do I look like someone who jokes?

11:28.647 --> 11:32.735
Relax, relax.
You guys got no sense of humor.

11:35.321 --> 11:39.200
Do you remember the fricking mess
you were when you came to me?

11:41.911 --> 11:44.705
I didn't seek you out. I was doing fine.

11:44.872 --> 11:49.668
I was on my way to running this city.
Remember? You needed me.

11:50.419 --> 11:54.924
I remember how it was, but now, I think we're even.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.592
Even?

11:57.301 --> 11:59.845
Now I know you're joking.
If it weren't for me...

12:00.012 --> 12:04.808
...your girl would be turning tricks on
K Street and you'd be somebody's toaster.

12:05.601 --> 12:09.313
So the way I see it, me and you
ain't even close to being even.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.149
You and me, we're done here.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.488
Bri.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.116
Yeah, you are done.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.619
So good luck.

12:23.786 --> 12:26.830
Hope you find a great doctor to replace Matthews.

12:26.997 --> 12:31.252
Too bad there aren't any within 500 kilometers from here.

12:33.003 --> 12:37.549
So bye-bye, adiÃ²s. Have a nice day.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.557
- What do you want'?
- Don't bother, Deunan.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.351
Well...

12:49.520 --> 12:54.441
I might need some annoying automatic
drones on the east side cleaned up.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.777
I wish I could find someone to do that...

12:57.319 --> 13:01.782
...but it seems everyone's busy
getting jobs elsewhere.

13:02.324 --> 13:03.325
We'll do it.

13:04.868 --> 13:08.664
We'll do it.
But first, a recharge and repair for Bri.

13:10.082 --> 13:11.834
Fine.

13:12.001 --> 13:14.545
Fix up your tin-can Casanova.

13:14.712 --> 13:17.172
But bring me any parts and ammo you find.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.591
And no skimming.

13:20.634 --> 13:24.221
Take this to Matthews.
It should cover the expenses.

13:25.389 --> 13:28.183
And if he don't want it, you keep it, Deunan.

13:28.350 --> 13:31.770
Consider it a early Valentine's gift
to add to your collection.

13:32.104 --> 13:34.523
You seemed awfully chummy back there.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.692
Thought you wanted away from Two Horns.

13:36.859 --> 13:40.779
I still do. But doing this job seems easier
than trying to kidnap Matthews.

13:40.946 --> 13:43.449
I don't care how Two Horns played it in there...

13:43.615 --> 13:45.784
...I know he was behind
that train ambush.

13:45.951 --> 13:48.203
I think so too, but we can't prove it.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.497
And we didn't bring him back the vaccine.

13:50.664 --> 13:53.334
So maybe we do owe him one more job.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.087
You know who talks like that?

13:58.255 --> 13:59.840
Junkies.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.096
Matthews.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.849
Matthews, you there?

14:19.485 --> 14:20.486
- No.
- Yes.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.529
Oh, all right.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.531
Catch.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.036
Another typical Two Horns paycheck.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.206
He doesn't seem to understand...

14:32.373 --> 14:35.376
...that these aren't as valuable
as he thinks they are.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.002
Oh, he understands.

14:37.586 --> 14:41.298
Here, keep it.
It's burned me once already.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.384
Well, come on.

14:47.930 --> 14:48.931
Take this.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.103
I haven't seen one of these...

14:54.395 --> 14:56.814
Not sure I've ever seen one of these.

14:58.399 --> 15:01.026
- K-12, right?
- Yep. A classic.

15:01.193 --> 15:04.780
Developed during the war.
A tactical weapon. For fast attacks.

15:04.947 --> 15:07.533
But the lack of range made it obsolete real quick.

15:07.699 --> 15:10.035
Yeah. I heard
the engineers who built this...

15:10.202 --> 15:13.497
...developed the parts without using
mass-production materials.

15:13.664 --> 15:16.333
Hey, I'm gonna.
You can geek out without me.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.669
- Yeah, okay.
- They don't even know I left.

15:18.836 --> 15:21.755
- So simple, but so original.
- I know, right?

15:21.922 --> 15:23.298
You're hurt.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.467
Let me take care of that.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.597
All I want is a recharge.

15:30.764 --> 15:35.144
You worry like an old woman.
I was a medic during the war.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.603
- Were you?
- A doctor.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.439
Now, let me see that.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.524
Where is it?

15:50.826 --> 15:52.828
To your health.

15:57.207 --> 16:00.544
The power for my cell is low again.

16:00.919 --> 16:03.714
I've charged that battery as much as I can.

16:03.881 --> 16:06.341
I'd like to reboot
your power-generator outs...

16:06.508 --> 16:10.262
...but we are short on parts.
I'm sorry. What else?

16:10.429 --> 16:13.765
Viewscreen. Movement.
Pretty much everything.

16:13.932 --> 16:16.935
Wish I knew more about your Hecatonchires system...

16:17.102 --> 16:19.229
...because they're probably all related.

16:19.396 --> 16:22.191
You know, you must've been really something to see...

16:22.357 --> 16:26.361
- ...when you were at full capacity.
- Yeah, yeah, rub it in.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.364
Everything changes. Everything.

16:29.531 --> 16:33.827
- Tough time to be a cyborg.
- Tough time to be anybody.

16:34.286 --> 16:38.957
Here. This might hurt a little.

16:45.589 --> 16:47.382
I swear that's your favorite part.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.676
My job has its perks.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.971
Hey, whatever happened with that?

16:53.138 --> 16:57.935
You know, I've been trying to fix that thing
ever since the day you brought it in.

16:58.477 --> 17:01.939
I got the mechanical parts down,
but the electronics are baffling.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.565
What about the K-12?

17:03.732 --> 17:06.902
Maybe. But that thing is almost
as sophisticated as you are.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.570
I'll look for the owner's manual on my last job.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.949
I thought that train job was your last one.

17:12.115 --> 17:15.786
Weren't you always saying
you wanted to get out of this town?

17:16.328 --> 17:19.915
That's what I always say too.
But Two Horns, he's like the mayor.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.875
He's the guy we have to answer to.

17:22.376 --> 17:26.380
Maybe this isn't my last job
for Two Horns, but it'll be hers.

17:28.173 --> 17:31.969
<i>Then she can start</i> a <i>new life, just like she wants.</i>

17:32.135 --> 17:35.847
Deunan? No way.
She'd never go without you.

17:36.014 --> 17:40.561
Maybe she would. If I wasn't around her
all the time, haunting her like a ghost.

17:40.727 --> 17:44.189
Ghosts are just beings from the past.
The real issue is right now.

17:44.356 --> 17:47.568
And that girl would rather be.
She wants to be with you.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.988
You should be the happiest man,
or thing, or man-thing around.

17:51.154 --> 17:54.449
Really?
Is that how it works?

17:54.616 --> 17:57.202
If you don't realize it's every man for himself...

17:57.369 --> 18:00.622
...you're never gonna be happy.
Never happy.

18:11.466 --> 18:12.718
Done.

18:12.884 --> 18:14.303
You should work better now.

18:14.469 --> 18:18.432
Just let me do one more check to make
sure there are no other problems.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.560
It looks okay.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.273
Get-well present.

18:28.483 --> 18:30.944
- Watch it.
- What's your problem? Pin's in it.

18:31.111 --> 18:34.823
- Yeah, the pin's in it.
- Not all of us would die for him. I wouldn't.

18:34.990 --> 18:37.784
I'm sorry. I wasn't asking you to.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.871
- I didn't mean anything.
- You should be okay now.

18:45.834 --> 18:49.004
He just seems, I don't know, creepy.

18:49.171 --> 18:51.673
- It's Matthews.
- Okay, "creepier."

18:51.840 --> 18:54.343
Oh, it's on the house.

18:54.509 --> 18:57.429
Just a little commemoration of your last job.

18:58.221 --> 18:59.765
Thanks.

19:00.223 --> 19:01.808
So how do you feel?

19:01.975 --> 19:04.645
I'd tell you, but I wouldn't wanna geek out on you.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.606
Good. That's nice of you.

19:17.532 --> 19:21.078
I heard the drones lost the ability
to identify friendlies.

19:21.244 --> 19:23.789
Now they just go after anyone.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.832
You think it's true?

19:26.124 --> 19:28.418
We could ask the friendlies...

19:28.710 --> 19:31.380
...but none of them ever came back.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.424
You're so encouraging.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.177
I am, aren't I?

19:48.605 --> 19:51.233
We sure made a mess of things, didn't we?

19:51.400 --> 19:53.110
Yeah.

19:53.652 --> 19:57.447
But this couldn't have happened
during the war. It's too recent.

19:57.614 --> 20:03.161
Based on the footprints,
it looks like multiple OSTRICH C-117s.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.580
The worst type.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.835
And there's a nest of them right there,
near the intersection.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.461
- Where?
- Over there.

20:12.295 --> 20:15.424
You see that circle of blasted-out cars?

20:16.341 --> 20:18.844
And there's another one 50 meters east of that.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.345
How do you know?

20:20.512 --> 20:23.974
They keep in their spider hole, just pop up and shoot.

20:24.141 --> 20:26.560
That's why all the remains are in a circle.

20:26.727 --> 20:30.063
If they do leave the nest, they hunt in pairs.

20:31.356 --> 20:33.108
What's their Achilles'?

20:33.275 --> 20:38.155
Limited ammo, programmed sequence,
and their head weighs a ton.

20:38.739 --> 20:40.824
Let's do it.

20:45.537 --> 20:46.621
Wait. Look.

20:48.165 --> 20:51.460
Three cyborgs.
Two combat, and one I don't know.

20:52.335 --> 20:55.505
- There's a girl with them.
- They don't know about the drones.

20:55.672 --> 20:58.884
- They'll be killed if they stay on course.
- Get back here.

21:00.135 --> 21:02.137
Goddamn it.

21:26.244 --> 21:28.789
Now's our chance. Hurry.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.749
Come on.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.382
Get her!

22:01.029 --> 22:03.031
Come on.

22:07.828 --> 22:09.704
You stay here.

22:22.717 --> 22:24.511
Damn it.

22:44.948 --> 22:46.741
Third one down.

23:02.924 --> 23:04.885
And that would be four.

23:07.971 --> 23:10.098
I'm coming down.

23:16.730 --> 23:20.233
You. Who are you?

23:20.859 --> 23:23.445
I've never seen anything like that.

23:23.612 --> 23:24.905
You a cyborg?

23:25.071 --> 23:27.866
Well, maybe.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.618
More man than machine, though.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.745
Where you from? You're not from here.

23:31.912 --> 23:35.749
No. And that's why I got caught
by some local punks.

23:35.916 --> 23:38.335
I appreciate the help, though.
Thanks a lot.

23:38.501 --> 23:42.047
Wherever you're from,
your punks are highly-trained.

23:42.213 --> 23:44.132
Maybe not punks, exactly.

23:45.967 --> 23:47.761
Can you help us?

23:57.854 --> 24:00.398
Good thing we were here cleaning up those drones.

24:00.565 --> 24:03.276
It's quite a coincidence that you were, isn't it?

24:03.652 --> 24:07.697
I'm Deunan. That's Briareos.
And you are...

24:08.239 --> 24:11.868
...not talking.

24:28.426 --> 24:29.427
What's the matter?

24:29.594 --> 24:34.099
- You should be able to lift that.
- I should. Things break.

24:35.809 --> 24:38.144
- War changes things.
- I know my way around...

24:38.311 --> 24:41.398
...a biomechanical system.
Why don't you let me look at it?

24:41.564 --> 24:46.945
It's the least I can offer since you both
risked your lives to save us. Okay. Fine.

24:47.112 --> 24:48.655
Maybe we should trust him.

24:48.822 --> 24:52.200
One day, your trust is gonna get me in a lot of trouble.

24:52.367 --> 24:54.911
All right, go ahead. Take a look.

24:55.078 --> 24:57.122
I'll be gentle.

25:07.215 --> 25:08.675
Checking your system.

25:14.139 --> 25:15.181
You

25:15.348 --> 25:17.767
You're a Hecatonchires combat cyborg.

25:17.934 --> 25:21.980
I've heard of these, but I... This is
the first time I've actually seen one.

25:22.147 --> 25:24.566
I know. I'm exciting.

25:24.733 --> 25:27.944
- Let's get on with it.
- Yeah, right. Sorry.

25:38.246 --> 25:39.748
This is it.

25:39.914 --> 25:42.459
A microchip blocking
the self-assessment program.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.669
It's a worm.

25:47.922 --> 25:51.259
Your heat sensor short-circuited.
It's completely burned out.

25:54.637 --> 25:58.433
The whole thing caused your cooling
system to eat up all your power.

25:58.600 --> 26:02.103
Didn't stop you from taking out those drones, though.

26:10.445 --> 26:13.323
- How is it?
- Show her.

26:28.838 --> 26:29.881
That's great.

26:35.595 --> 26:37.889
See? Gentle.

26:40.725 --> 26:44.187
- You guys from around here?
- More or less.

26:46.022 --> 26:48.316
- We should get out of here together.
- Olson.

26:48.483 --> 26:50.527
Olson?

26:50.693 --> 26:52.362
His name's Olson.

26:52.529 --> 26:55.240
I was taught never to get in a car with a stranger.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.367
Totally agree.

26:57.534 --> 26:58.618
Thanks.

27:00.370 --> 27:02.330
My name is Olson.

27:02.497 --> 27:04.207
She's Iris.

27:04.999 --> 27:07.418
You're cleaning up the drones from the war?

27:07.585 --> 27:09.754
Yeah, but that's not our regular work.

27:09.963 --> 27:11.256
Well, it should be.

27:11.422 --> 27:13.258
You're very good at it.

27:13.424 --> 27:17.095
We're cleaning up remaining war threats as well.

27:17.262 --> 27:19.639
- Really? For who?
- Doesn't matter.

27:19.806 --> 27:23.560
Right now, we have something we might
need a little bit of help with.

27:25.353 --> 27:27.814
Who the hell is that?

27:27.981 --> 27:32.318
Probably the same people
who don't want us to accomplish our task.

27:32.902 --> 27:34.028
What do you think?

27:34.195 --> 27:38.825
I think people like that would kill us
just because we're with them.

27:38.992 --> 27:41.161
So now we're stuck together.

28:00.555 --> 28:03.308
They ran into some old drones.

28:03.474 --> 28:05.518
Combat followed.

28:05.685 --> 28:07.478
I need details.

28:08.396 --> 28:11.649
From the footprint and shells,
it looks like a heavy cyborg...

28:11.816 --> 28:16.279
...with a high-powered sniper rifle
that came from the city side.

28:16.446 --> 28:21.784
And someone who was smaller and
fasterjoined in with a 6 mm assault rifle.

28:21.951 --> 28:24.579
- And?
- And they headed that direction.

28:24.746 --> 28:29.167
Those drones are still warm.
It was probably less than 30 minutes ago.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.670
And their two new friends?

28:32.837 --> 28:35.465
Seems like they went with them.

28:35.632 --> 28:38.760
- Let's get back to the city.
- We're not chasing them?

28:38.927 --> 28:42.347
Whoever is helping them, they can take out the drones.

28:42.513 --> 28:45.099
We need to know what we're up against.

28:45.266 --> 28:48.895
Then I believe we should pay a visit
to our friend downtown.

28:49.062 --> 28:53.900
- He's familiar with hired guns.
- Good. Let's move out.

29:19.175 --> 29:22.011
It's been a while since I saw one of those.

29:22.178 --> 29:24.305
Who the hell is on it?

29:25.098 --> 29:26.933
Good question.

29:27.100 --> 29:30.895
With all the heavy firepower,
you're lucky they didn't show up earlier.

29:31.062 --> 29:33.189
You go get Iris.

29:35.608 --> 29:37.819
Looks like we found some trouble, Bri.

29:37.986 --> 29:40.863
Let's go search those drones for ammo.

29:41.030 --> 29:43.449
Or anything else we can find.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.209
How's she look?

29:54.669 --> 29:57.463
Too young for this. Innocent.

29:58.089 --> 30:00.466
She seems pretty tough to me.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.760
I'm not sure how innocent she really is.

30:02.927 --> 30:05.513
She's just trying to stay tough for their mission.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.224
They believe it's an important one, don%they?

30:08.391 --> 30:10.268
Yes, they do.

30:15.982 --> 30:17.442
What?

30:18.568 --> 30:21.612
It's just that we've been on the road for a while...

30:21.779 --> 30:24.490
- ...and you...
- Don't need a charge?

30:24.657 --> 30:25.658
Yeah.

30:26.117 --> 30:29.912
Why didn't Matthews figure out
something that Olson found instantly?

30:30.079 --> 30:33.207
He told me he was a medic in the war, not a mechanic.

30:33.374 --> 30:37.086
I don't buy it.
He knows his way around a machine.

30:37.670 --> 30:40.506
Do you think Matthews was trying to cripple you?

30:40.673 --> 30:42.467
I don't know.

30:42.633 --> 30:44.469
He always seemed okay.

30:44.635 --> 30:46.346
I guess.

30:46.804 --> 30:48.848
Although he did work for Two Horns.

30:49.474 --> 30:51.142
So did We.

30:58.608 --> 31:00.443
You see something out there?

31:00.610 --> 31:04.072
No. We're out of gas.

31:07.283 --> 31:09.118
Where are they?

31:09.285 --> 31:10.953
Dead, maybe.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.956
I gave them the easiest mission they've ever had.

31:14.123 --> 31:15.291
Something's up.

31:16.334 --> 31:17.835
Maybe they skipped town?

31:18.002 --> 31:20.129
We made that impossible.

31:20.296 --> 31:22.673
Go see what you can find out.

31:28.596 --> 31:30.681
Gentlemen.

31:36.979 --> 31:40.608
Talos. To what do I owe this pleasure?

31:40.775 --> 31:42.902
Seems we have a common interest.

31:43.569 --> 31:44.946
How can that be?

31:45.113 --> 31:48.491
I'm but a small businessman.
You run Triton.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.993
What do you know about the girl?

31:51.702 --> 31:55.665
- There's a girl? Is she hot?
- Don't play cute with me.

31:55.832 --> 31:58.292
I can't help it. I'm naturally cute.

31:59.710 --> 32:01.087
Where'd they take her?

32:01.629 --> 32:06.843
Look, you know that there's no one as
interested in keeping me alive as me...

32:07.385 --> 32:10.012
...but I don't know what
you talking about.

32:10.179 --> 32:14.016
You employ a heavyweight cyborg, do you not?

32:14.183 --> 32:16.811
Are you talking about Briareos?

32:17.937 --> 32:21.482
He's a nobody. A hired gun. That's all.

32:21.649 --> 32:26.863
- Is that what this is about?
- It's about the girl your cyborg kidnapped.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.992
- Do you know?
- If this is about Briareos, I can help you.

32:31.159 --> 32:33.828
But I don't know about any kidnapped girl.

32:34.454 --> 32:38.583
- You know something.
- I don't.

32:38.749 --> 32:41.878
Hey, beautiful, you think you can help me out?

32:42.879 --> 32:46.090
He seems to be telling the truth.

32:46.257 --> 32:50.261
Perhaps our paths have crossed one too many times.

32:50.428 --> 32:55.099
And since I am looking to rebuild
the world without people like you...

32:55.266 --> 32:59.020
...it may be time we parted ways.

33:00.104 --> 33:02.148
I doubt we will see each other again.

33:02.732 --> 33:05.902
You're leaving the city?
So sorry to hear that.

33:06.068 --> 33:11.532
It is not my departure you will mourn.

33:21.417 --> 33:23.169
Should I call you a cab?

33:35.598 --> 33:38.476
I was hoping it wouldn't go down this way.

33:38.643 --> 33:40.686
Hope. What a concept.

34:02.959 --> 34:04.961
This is gonna take some time.

34:15.763 --> 34:18.266
This is gonna be a while. Take a seat.

34:18.431 --> 34:21.101
Thanks. Just for a minute.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.527
Feel like some company?

34:35.157 --> 34:38.661
You know, you're awfully young
to be mixed up in trouble like this.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.998
Silent treatment, huh?

34:43.165 --> 34:45.876
Fine, I get it. I get it.

34:46.043 --> 34:49.213
You know, we really did save your ass back there.

34:49.380 --> 34:52.632
And Olson fixed your friend.
So the way I see it, we're even.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.553
Okay. Fair enough.

34:58.431 --> 35:01.767
Is there a chance we ran into you guys
and it was a coincidence?

35:01.934 --> 35:06.314
Well, of course.
You might be spies that Talos sent.

35:06.480 --> 35:11.277
I have no idea, so I would just
rather not talk to you at all.

35:12.069 --> 35:14.155
I understand that.

35:21.537 --> 35:24.040
Are you guys soldiers?

35:24.707 --> 35:26.667
Let me put it this way:

35:27.084 --> 35:29.712
We're not spies.

35:33.716 --> 35:35.718
You're gonna have to trust me sometime.

35:35.885 --> 35:38.095
Give me a straight answer, you'll earn it.

35:38.262 --> 35:40.097
What do you wanna know?

35:40.306 --> 35:42.600
Who's in the chopper?

35:43.726 --> 35:45.728
You ever hear of Triton?

35:45.895 --> 35:47.063
I'm listening.

35:47.229 --> 35:51.233
Well, their leader, Talos...

35:52.735 --> 35:54.320
...he's after Iris.

35:55.529 --> 35:57.823
- Why?
- Because of her mission.

35:59.533 --> 36:02.703
Talos used to be part of a team that I worked with.

36:02.870 --> 36:05.414
What team? Where were they from?

36:06.832 --> 36:08.000
Olympus.

36:09.585 --> 36:14.965
Of course they were.
It's the salvation of all mankind, right?

36:15.132 --> 36:19.011
If you trust in that, don't be surprised
if I don't have any trust in you.

36:19.512 --> 36:22.640
Tell you what. I won't try to
convince you about Olympus...

36:22.807 --> 36:25.518
...and you don't worry about
whether it's the truth.

36:25.685 --> 36:27.770
Fine by me.

36:28.437 --> 36:29.689
What's the mission?

36:31.399 --> 36:33.067
That's classified.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.611
Just when we were beginning to open up.

36:35.778 --> 36:37.988
I wanna tell you. Look...

36:38.489 --> 36:41.075
...let's just focus
on getting through this alive.

36:41.242 --> 36:43.202
I am focused.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.997
- Are you ready?
- We're good to go.

36:47.456 --> 36:49.041
I'll navigate this time.

36:52.294 --> 36:53.295
Okay.

36:53.921 --> 36:55.339
<i>Citizens.</i>

36:55.506 --> 36:58.759
<i>I have the great pleasure to offer the news myself.</i>

36:58.926 --> 37:01.637
<i>Last night, the city's biggest criminal, Two Horns...</i>

37:01.804 --> 37:03.806
<i>...was killed with the help of Triton.</i>

37:05.266 --> 37:07.017
<i>With this major accomplishment...</i>

37:07.184 --> 37:10.312
...we <i>can now start to rebuild our world
one city at</i> a <i>time.</i>

37:11.647 --> 37:15.693
<i>Beginning here, the world's greatest city, New York.</i>

37:20.322 --> 37:22.992
- Our boss gonna be okay?
- He'll be fine.

37:23.451 --> 37:25.536
He was lucky, though.

37:25.703 --> 37:26.996
Talos thinks he's dead.

37:27.955 --> 37:29.999
That's probably lucky too.

37:34.003 --> 37:36.172
Did you find Briareos?

37:36.422 --> 37:38.048
We know which way they went.

37:41.010 --> 37:42.052
Stop.

37:43.888 --> 37:47.892
We gotta find that girl.
You saw Talos. He's desperate.

37:48.058 --> 37:50.186
And desperate means...

37:52.813 --> 37:56.192
I told you to be still now.

37:56.776 --> 37:59.236
Just shut up and fix me!

38:03.491 --> 38:04.950
You're welcome.

38:06.118 --> 38:07.411
Come on.

38:07.578 --> 38:10.414
No. Stop.

38:10.581 --> 38:12.833
You should rest.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.710
I hope he comes back soon.

38:14.877 --> 38:17.129
I love it when we play doctor.

38:31.101 --> 38:33.312
Smells like you're cooking again.

38:33.479 --> 38:37.483
You're hilarious. You can thank
Two Horns for tonight's hot meal.

38:38.150 --> 38:42.488
- Well, I can't thank you. You can't cook.
- Never been a strong suit.

38:42.780 --> 38:45.741
- You've got others.
- How'd it go?

38:47.201 --> 38:48.619
Nobody's here anymore.

38:49.411 --> 38:52.081
Probably deserted since the war.

38:57.461 --> 38:59.463
Did you find out where they're from?

39:00.631 --> 39:03.425
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

39:03.592 --> 39:05.302
Come on. Where?

39:05.469 --> 39:07.012
They said...

39:07.179 --> 39:10.307
- ...they're from Olympus.
- Olympus? Really?

39:10.474 --> 39:13.519
- So it's real.
- I doubt it.

39:13.686 --> 39:15.437
He's clammed up about everything.

39:15.604 --> 39:18.774
I think the story about Olympus
is just another smoke screen.

39:18.941 --> 39:20.818
Yeah. Maybe.

39:20.985 --> 39:22.945
But Olson's parts...

39:23.112 --> 39:25.865
- ...I've never seen anything like that.
- You haven't?

39:27.867 --> 39:31.203
Hey. We were wondering
where you were.

39:31.370 --> 39:33.497
Did you find what you were looking for?

39:43.173 --> 39:45.092
I'll take the first watch.

39:46.260 --> 39:48.762
You try to get some sleep.

39:50.514 --> 39:54.685
I'll go check the town again.
You, stay here.

40:02.318 --> 40:06.614
The stars seem brighter
than before the war, don't you think?

40:06.780 --> 40:09.241
- I don't really remember.
- I do.

40:10.367 --> 40:12.786
I remember my family.

40:12.953 --> 40:16.165
I remember Briareos when he wasn't...

40:16.332 --> 40:18.334
...disillusioned.

40:20.169 --> 40:23.881
- War has a way of doing that to people.
- Yeah.

40:24.048 --> 40:28.302
But I know deep down,
he's still the same man I fell in love with.

40:28.469 --> 40:31.889
He's still willing to fight for a good cause.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.976
- Is that why he's helping us?
- I don't know.

40:36.143 --> 40:37.728
Are you a good cause?

40:39.104 --> 40:41.148
I think so.

40:42.483 --> 40:43.734
I hope so.

40:46.320 --> 40:49.239
So tell me. Are you from Olympus?

40:49.406 --> 40:52.242
- Olson shouldn't have said anything.
- Maybe not.

40:52.409 --> 40:53.911
But he did and I wanna know.

40:54.078 --> 40:56.789
We're on our way there.
After we finish the mission.

40:56.956 --> 40:59.875
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

41:00.042 --> 41:01.961
I knew it.

41:02.127 --> 41:05.756
You've been there.
Do you believe it's what they say it is?

41:05.923 --> 41:07.675
I don't know.

41:08.467 --> 41:13.347
But I do know the old way of doing things
will not build a better future.

41:14.223 --> 41:18.894
Without something like Olympus, mankind will fail.

41:19.186 --> 41:22.314
I hate to break it to you, kid, but we failed.

41:22.815 --> 41:27.569
I'm reminded of it every day.
The memory of what we built.

41:27.778 --> 41:30.072
The reality of what we destroyed.

41:30.239 --> 41:32.908
How we are separated.

41:33.075 --> 41:37.538
And how it never really happens.
The mighty are never brought low.

41:37.705 --> 41:39.873
And the weak just disappear.

41:40.040 --> 41:42.376
People are greedy.

41:43.252 --> 41:46.755
They want, money, land, power.

41:47.881 --> 41:51.885
Whatever it is that makes them feel like
they're better than someone else...

41:52.052 --> 41:54.513
...or more important.

41:55.264 --> 41:59.059
And so they lied and deceived.

41:59.226 --> 42:03.814
Killed each other because of foolish pride...

42:03.981 --> 42:06.608
...then told themselves it was justified.

42:06.775 --> 42:08.610
But it wasn't.

42:09.611 --> 42:12.573
And in the end, we lost everything.

42:16.744 --> 42:19.955
You hope for a place like Olympus...

42:20.205 --> 42:23.876
...and yet you give up
on the world where you live.

42:25.711 --> 42:28.213
You can't stay undecided forever, Deunan.

42:28.380 --> 42:32.092
- You have to make a choice.
- About what?

42:34.428 --> 42:37.473
Either you accept the world as it is...

42:39.016 --> 42:41.518
...or you work to build a better one.

42:48.817 --> 42:51.195
We still have a long road ahead.

42:51.361 --> 42:53.447
I'm gonna get some sleep.

42:53.739 --> 42:55.324
Okay.

42:57.034 --> 42:58.494
Night.

43:10.297 --> 43:12.299
Olympus.

43:30.025 --> 43:31.401
- Something's coming.
- What?

43:31.568 --> 43:35.030
A tank. Five kilometers from here,
heading straight to us.

43:35.197 --> 43:38.492
- A tank? Where's the chopper?
- I've seen it before in the city.

43:38.659 --> 43:40.702
Iris, get up.

43:41.286 --> 43:42.996
- What is it?
- Trouble.

43:43.163 --> 43:46.416
The chopper left for the city and now we see a tank.

43:46.583 --> 43:49.002
- You know what that means.
- Two Horns.

43:49.169 --> 43:53.173
- Wait. You know who's in that tank?
- Yeah, I know him.

43:53.340 --> 43:54.424
We go way back.

43:54.591 --> 43:57.261
But what kind of history could he have with Triton?

43:57.427 --> 44:00.931
Keep in contact.
We'll take care of them.

44:01.431 --> 44:04.101
Here. You get inside and protect Iris.

44:05.769 --> 44:07.521
We good?

44:09.565 --> 44:11.191
Here.

44:11.650 --> 44:12.985
Thanks.

44:13.152 --> 44:16.113
- Briareos.
- What is it?

44:16.697 --> 44:18.365
It can wait. We'll talk later.

44:18.699 --> 44:20.409
Later?

44:20.576 --> 44:22.536
You really are an optimist.

44:22.703 --> 44:24.371
Come on.

44:31.795 --> 44:35.340
City tanks are usually pretty agile,
but this one seems slow.

44:35.507 --> 44:39.219
You'd be slow too if you were carrying
Two-Ton-Two-Horns around, right?

44:39.386 --> 44:41.096
Good point.

44:47.519 --> 44:50.022
Yeah, that's them, all right.

44:51.023 --> 44:53.317
Why don't you give them a big fat hello?

45:03.869 --> 45:05.078
He means business.

45:06.288 --> 45:09.583
They disappeared from the screen
but I don't think we got them.

45:09.750 --> 45:14.338
- They jumped out before the grenade hit.
- What? That's impossible.

45:14.504 --> 45:17.132
Briareos doesn't have the power to be that mobile.

45:23.722 --> 45:25.224
- Now what?
- I was thinking...

45:25.390 --> 45:29.102
- ...we blow the living shit out of them.
- Oh, yeah, I like that.

45:42.699 --> 45:44.368
There he is.

45:58.882 --> 46:01.176
He got away, chase him.

46:05.138 --> 46:07.349
Sniper fire, 11 o'clock.

46:07.516 --> 46:09.351
Big deal. It ain't gonna hurt us.

46:09.518 --> 46:13.397
- Now, stay focused on getting Briareos.
- Emergency.

46:25.742 --> 46:27.911
Do you think they'll be okay?

46:28.078 --> 46:30.497
I think they're both very capable.

46:39.423 --> 46:41.967
You're making me waste my ammo, you hunk of junk.

46:45.637 --> 46:46.680
Holy shit!

46:47.681 --> 46:50.809
I'm sick of his cat and mouse game.

46:51.018 --> 46:53.729
Get the fast little honey out of the way now.

47:08.493 --> 47:10.162
Stay here.

47:11.121 --> 47:13.999
If something happens to me, tell them your mission.

47:14.333 --> 47:17.169
They'll help you, I know it.

47:18.670 --> 47:20.130
I know.

47:20.297 --> 47:21.965
But you're gonna survive this.

47:22.132 --> 47:25.552
Of course I am. I hear I'm an optimist.

48:09.304 --> 48:10.305
Come on.

48:12.265 --> 48:13.934
This way.

48:18.688 --> 48:20.148
You little motherf'.

48:34.371 --> 48:37.374
He fell. Get him.

48:37.541 --> 48:40.127
The rest of you, get back here.

49:25.464 --> 49:28.508
Careful. His sensors
aren't just for decoration.

49:32.429 --> 49:34.181
Briareos.

49:34.890 --> 49:36.516
I have a deal for you.

49:37.100 --> 49:41.271
If you hand over the girl,
I'll forgive you for running off.

49:41.438 --> 49:44.149
Quite an offer, but I'll have to pass.

49:44.316 --> 49:49.196
Okay, but then I'll just turn you
into scrap and take the girl anyway.

49:49.362 --> 49:52.616
And if you're scrap, you know what happens to Deunan.

49:53.033 --> 49:54.826
So you got to ask yourself:

49:54.993 --> 49:57.787
Is this girl you just met really worth it?

49:58.413 --> 49:59.915
Yes.

50:03.293 --> 50:05.212
So annoying.

50:08.340 --> 50:10.884
- Olson.
- Who the hell was that?

50:19.476 --> 50:21.228
Wait. Is that the girl?

50:34.115 --> 50:35.158
Iris.

50:41.790 --> 50:43.667
Bri was right.

50:44.209 --> 50:46.836
You're not as innocent as you look.

50:47.963 --> 50:49.714
Hey.

50:52.259 --> 50:55.762
All right. Let's get you out of this mess.

50:58.848 --> 51:01.768
- You did good, Iris.
- Thanks, you too.

51:01.935 --> 51:03.019
Where's Olson?

51:03.562 --> 51:05.313
I'm okay.

51:10.318 --> 51:12.279
We make a good team.

51:13.238 --> 51:15.240
I'm glad you think so.

51:15.407 --> 51:17.909
We need to get out of here.
Let's move.

51:18.076 --> 51:20.161
We'll go get the car.

51:21.580 --> 51:23.456
You still trust them?

51:28.003 --> 51:29.879
She really saved our asses.

51:30.046 --> 51:33.133
She should have. She's the one
who got our asses into this.

51:33.300 --> 51:35.594
Still, better than doing jobs for Two Horns.

51:35.760 --> 51:38.138
Just about anything is better than.

51:41.016 --> 51:42.475
Iris.

51:42.642 --> 51:43.810
- No.
- Iris!

51:43.977 --> 51:46.354
No. No!

51:46.730 --> 51:48.440
Deunan. Deunan.

51:53.945 --> 51:54.946
Deunan!

52:01.578 --> 52:04.205
- What about them?
- Send them a gift.

52:08.585 --> 52:09.711
Run, now.

52:19.429 --> 52:21.473
No!

52:22.682 --> 52:26.061
There goes your last hope.

53:09.229 --> 53:10.897
You Okay?

53:11.064 --> 53:12.399
Yeah.

53:12.565 --> 53:14.859
My ear is ringing...

53:16.486 --> 53:17.487
...but I think so.

53:20.865 --> 53:21.866
Where are they?

53:33.128 --> 53:35.588
They couldn't have gotten far.

53:35.755 --> 53:37.090
Bri, they have a chopper.

53:37.924 --> 53:40.593
I can still trace Olson's radio signal.

53:41.720 --> 53:43.805
It's getting weaker, though.

53:45.682 --> 53:47.267
Deunan.

53:47.434 --> 53:50.437
- We're gonna get her back.
- Okay.

54:06.286 --> 54:08.705
You've been very hard to find.

54:08.872 --> 54:10.832
All this effort for this?

54:10.999 --> 54:15.253
You know what they say:
good things, small packages.

54:15.420 --> 54:17.714
And this little package is our key.

54:19.007 --> 54:20.091
Where is it?

54:20.508 --> 54:23.178
I don't know what you're talking about.

54:25.054 --> 54:27.265
I think you do.

54:27.432 --> 54:29.684
You really think she'll tell you?

54:29.851 --> 54:31.644
Maybe not.

54:33.646 --> 54:36.399
But I bet you will.

54:37.108 --> 54:38.526
Where is the weapon?

54:38.693 --> 54:42.739
That wonderful toy that you want to destroy.

54:42.906 --> 54:44.699
Right. Like he'd tell you.

54:45.241 --> 54:46.659
Give it up, Talos.

54:46.826 --> 54:48.787
It's over.

54:48.953 --> 54:51.331
Always the same.

54:51.498 --> 54:54.626
Making simple things...

54:55.293 --> 54:59.964
...so very complicated.

55:18.024 --> 55:19.776
You can't.

55:21.444 --> 55:23.363
I can.

55:23.530 --> 55:26.533
You used to know me better than that.

55:27.867 --> 55:29.786
Take her west.

55:33.164 --> 55:36.042
Wait. You have what you want.
Please, don't kill him.

55:36.209 --> 55:38.419
People never get what they want.

55:38.586 --> 55:40.588
You'll find that out soon enough.

55:40.755 --> 55:43.466
That city is an idea that will never work.

55:43.633 --> 55:45.844
Just like her cries.

55:46.010 --> 55:48.137
You're wrong, Talos.

55:48.304 --> 55:50.974
Perhaps I am wrong.

55:54.602 --> 55:56.688
- No! No!
- Does it matter?

55:56.855 --> 55:58.022
No!

56:04.195 --> 56:05.989
Olson!

56:06.155 --> 56:08.658
No!

56:24.048 --> 56:25.842
- You okay?
- Of course I'm okay.

56:26.009 --> 56:28.177
- Where's the girl?
- Talos took her.

56:28.344 --> 56:30.054
What the hell is going on?

56:30.221 --> 56:31.723
Get Matthews on the line.

56:31.890 --> 56:34.475
- Should I call for pickup?
- No.

56:34.642 --> 56:36.436
We're going after those suckers.

56:36.603 --> 56:38.396
After Briareos and Deunan?

56:38.563 --> 56:41.399
No. Talos.

56:41.983 --> 56:45.236
He's been nothing but trouble for me
since he came to my city.

56:45.403 --> 56:47.947
Now he humiliates me like that?

56:48.114 --> 56:51.951
- We're kind of outgunned.
- You shut up and you man up!

56:55.079 --> 56:57.874
It's on now.

57:01.336 --> 57:02.921
The signal's getting stronger.

57:03.087 --> 57:04.380
We're close.

57:04.547 --> 57:06.883
There's nothing around here.

57:18.019 --> 57:19.729
Olson.

57:27.946 --> 57:29.238
No.

57:29.405 --> 57:31.199
- They killed him.
- He's a cyborg.

57:31.741 --> 57:32.784
He's still dead.

57:32.951 --> 57:34.535
Olson was a soldier.

57:34.702 --> 57:36.579
He knew the risks.

57:36.746 --> 57:38.164
I know, but...

57:38.957 --> 57:41.542
You think he'd want it to end this way?

57:42.168 --> 57:44.754
We finish what he started.

57:49.717 --> 57:51.928
I don't think I can.

57:52.095 --> 57:54.973
- What?
- It's too much.

58:02.313 --> 58:03.982
The death.

58:05.650 --> 58:09.195
They could have taken her anywhere.
It's pointless.

58:14.951 --> 58:15.952
I was wrong.

58:16.911 --> 58:17.912
What?

58:20.790 --> 58:23.042
I think I was wrong.

58:24.127 --> 58:26.170
You weren't wrong. You're not wrong.

58:26.629 --> 58:28.297
I was.

58:28.464 --> 58:30.550
I was living moment to moment.

58:30.717 --> 58:32.719
Not doing anything but surviving.

58:32.885 --> 58:34.679
That's all we could do.

58:35.054 --> 58:37.056
It's not.

58:37.473 --> 58:40.685
Olson died for something he believed in.

58:43.271 --> 58:45.106
It's time for us to change, Deunan.

58:46.441 --> 58:48.568
What do you mean?

58:48.735 --> 58:50.695
We need to make a choice.

58:52.572 --> 58:54.490
So we keep looking.

58:54.657 --> 58:56.951
And maybe we don't find Iris.

58:57.118 --> 58:59.746
Maybe we'll be killed in the effort.

59:00.329 --> 59:02.498
But we have to try.

59:14.343 --> 59:15.887
Okay.

59:16.054 --> 59:17.847
We try.

59:28.191 --> 59:30.109
His hand.

59:33.321 --> 59:34.489
Bri, look.

59:38.826 --> 59:39.952
What's on it?

59:40.119 --> 59:44.415
Whatever it is, it was so important
he was willing to die for it.

59:49.170 --> 59:51.172
- Can you read it?
- It's the mission.

59:52.507 --> 59:55.218
There's some kind of bunker.
Near here.

59:55.384 --> 59:57.512
- What?
- You remember how they believed...

59:57.678 --> 59:59.931
- ...their mission was so important?
- Yeah.

01:00:00.098 --> 01:00:03.309
They undersold it.
This isn't gonna be easy.

01:00:03.476 --> 01:00:04.477
It never is.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:53.526
After you.

01:00:53.693 --> 01:00:55.653
I'll die before I tell you anything.

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:57.989
I can arrange that.

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:17.550
There's nothing here.

01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:20.011
So it seems.

01:01:36.027 --> 01:01:38.112
How did you know?

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:47.663
- Nyx.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:49.165
You four, stay here.

01:01:49.332 --> 01:01:51.751
The rest, follow me.

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:20.947
It's perfect.

01:02:25.284 --> 01:02:27.578
Olson told me he and Talos worked together.

01:02:27.745 --> 01:02:29.789
Must've been when he found out about it.

01:02:29.956 --> 01:02:31.082
Probably.

01:02:31.249 --> 01:02:33.751
We need to make sure he never actually finds it.

01:02:33.918 --> 01:02:37.421
- I think we can do it if we hit first.
- How many are we looking at?

01:02:37.588 --> 01:02:41.217
I could only confirm 14.
That's 15 with the pilot.

01:02:41.384 --> 01:02:44.470
- I was hoping for a challenge.
- We have to be careful, Bri.

01:02:44.637 --> 01:02:49.475
- They still have Iris. She could get hurt.
- She's not the one who's gonna get hurt.

01:03:34.854 --> 01:03:37.523
It looks incomplete.

01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:42.278
It's a prototype, you see?

01:03:42.445 --> 01:03:43.904
Will it Work?

01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:48.909
Of course it will. If not, why would they
send her all this way to destroy it?

01:03:49.076 --> 01:03:50.703
How did you know about it?

01:03:52.079 --> 01:03:54.081
It speaks.

01:03:54.248 --> 01:03:56.083
The information about this weapon

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:58.836
Is a top secret, even in Olympus.

01:03:59.003 --> 01:04:02.298
- No.
- Didn't Olson tell you about me?

01:04:02.465 --> 01:04:06.469
He and I were sent from Olympus to do postwar cleanup.

01:04:06.635 --> 01:04:09.305
But to try and disarm the world?

01:04:09.472 --> 01:04:13.768
So futile and what a terribly misguided notion.

01:04:13.934 --> 01:04:16.395
So I decided to activate this.

01:04:17.229 --> 01:04:18.564
A weapon.

01:04:18.731 --> 01:04:22.860
One that could realize my vision of a new world order.

01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:26.989
- And you
- I will never do anything to help you.

01:04:27.156 --> 01:04:29.367
My only mission is to destroy that monster.

01:04:33.454 --> 01:04:37.333
I've had enough of your Olympus nonsense.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:41.796
What you fail to understand is that people love war.

01:04:41.962 --> 01:04:43.964
They make stories about it.

01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:48.094
They create larger-than-life heroes
because of it.

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.514
It's human nature to romanticize war.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:56.685
If we didn't, life would be so
desperately boring, don't you think?

01:04:56.852 --> 01:05:02.024
You and I are about to make
this world very, very exciting.

01:05:24.797 --> 01:05:26.215
Hang on.

01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:45.568
Deunan?

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:51.824
So resilient.

01:05:51.991 --> 01:05:53.325
Show them they're not.

01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:55.911
Use the machines.

01:06:03.794 --> 01:06:05.754
Iris.

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:07.882
Over there.

01:06:08.924 --> 01:06:10.676
Talos have her?

01:06:13.512 --> 01:06:15.681
They're bringing out the birds.

01:06:24.315 --> 01:06:26.567
We're gonna lose her. Damn it.

01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:44.084
Friend or foe?

01:06:44.251 --> 01:06:47.087
Hard to say. It's Two Horns.

01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:49.381
Two Horns?

01:06:50.633 --> 01:06:53.302
This how you treat someone who just saved your ass?

01:06:53.469 --> 01:06:55.679
- When you're the one who's doing it.
- Jeez.

01:06:55.846 --> 01:06:59.266
Try to do something nice for someone.
So ungrateful.

01:06:59.433 --> 01:07:00.476
What's your game?

01:07:00.643 --> 01:07:03.103
All right, you recycled smart car.

01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:04.647
I'll tell you what I want.

01:07:05.648 --> 01:07:07.483
I want the same thing you want.

01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:10.778
Three eyes and you still can't see she doesn't like you.

01:07:10.945 --> 01:07:12.112
A funny boy.

01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:14.281
Seriously, don't quit your day job.

01:07:14.448 --> 01:07:17.159
- Can I kill him now?
- Be my guest.

01:07:21.539 --> 01:07:22.790
Matthews?

01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:25.042
And friend.

01:07:25.209 --> 01:07:27.753
- How's the power supply?
- I deserve that.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.214
But Two Horns can be very persuasive.

01:07:30.381 --> 01:07:32.758
Yeah. Point taken.

01:07:32.925 --> 01:07:36.679
- Consider it a peace offering.
- Well, if it isn't, I'm using it on you.

01:07:59.493 --> 01:08:03.747
All I had to do was retract the turbo drive
from the subsection of the main lift.

01:08:03.914 --> 01:08:05.624
Yeah.

01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:11.046
Then that K-12 that Briareos
gave me really came in handy.

01:08:20.514 --> 01:08:22.933
- Ready?
- Let's quit talking about it.

01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:25.394
Iris.

01:08:26.854 --> 01:08:30.608
The verification system is called "Iris."

01:08:32.276 --> 01:08:34.444
Come here.

01:08:37.865 --> 01:08:39.408
Go.

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:52.379
There's nothing we can do from here.

01:08:52.546 --> 01:08:54.840
They have control. From inside.

01:09:06.852 --> 01:09:07.853
Briareos!

01:09:08.729 --> 01:09:11.106
Go! I've got this.

01:09:16.403 --> 01:09:18.072
Look.

01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:24.411
Yes. Open your eyes,
and see your future.

01:10:00.656 --> 01:10:04.243
<i>ALBS Arachnoid Class Land Battleship.</i>

01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:07.538
<i>Serial number, 000.</i>

01:10:07.705 --> 01:10:09.832
<i>System initiating.</i>

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:13.460
Incredible.

01:10:13.627 --> 01:10:18.006
It's sad you don't understand
the reason why you were made.

01:10:18.841 --> 01:10:20.551
<i>Engine ignition begun.</i>

01:10:20.718 --> 01:10:23.554
<i>All personnel should evacuate main chamber.</i>

01:10:23.721 --> 01:10:27.015
<i>Engine ignition begun.</i>

01:10:27.391 --> 01:10:30.436
You created a city and named it Olympus...

01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:35.315
...believing that would
make you all gods.

01:10:49.079 --> 01:10:50.080
Iris.

01:10:50.789 --> 01:10:51.790
Deunan.

01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:11.185
Why can't I get this under my control?

01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:12.770
<i>Hull breach verified.</i>

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:15.063
<i>Self-defense system protocol initiated.</i>

01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:16.815
<i>- No.
- Hu/I breach verified.</i>

01:11:16.982 --> 01:11:18.400
It's too late, Talos.

01:11:18.567 --> 01:11:20.861
Nothing can stop it now.

01:11:21.028 --> 01:11:22.905
<i>Hull breach verified.</i>

01:11:52.601 --> 01:11:53.602
<i>I'm on top.</i>

01:12:15.916 --> 01:12:17.209
I think I like you.

01:13:04.673 --> 01:13:05.924
You're too late.

01:13:06.091 --> 01:13:09.052
She's already dead.

01:13:12.097 --> 01:13:15.267
No. But you are.

01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:04.942
Holy shit.

01:14:46.858 --> 01:14:48.902
That thing is a monster.

01:14:49.069 --> 01:14:51.113
No wonder Talos wanted it.

01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:53.615
What happened?
Where's Talos, and the girl?

01:14:53.782 --> 01:14:55.158
Inside that weapon.

01:14:55.325 --> 01:14:57.327
But how are we gonna get up to it?

01:14:57.494 --> 01:14:59.579
What do you mean "we"?

01:15:05.252 --> 01:15:07.129
You haven't told me your plan.

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:09.589
No time.
You're gonna have to trust me.

01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:12.300
Trust me.

01:15:17.973 --> 01:15:21.977
- So far your plan's really working.
- Hold tight, sweetie-pie.

01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:33.864
Briareos.

01:15:41.121 --> 01:15:44.374
As I suspected.
The exterior is not complete.

01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:46.376
Gotta be a weak spot somewhere.

01:15:47.544 --> 01:15:48.587
There. You see that?

01:15:48.754 --> 01:15:52.507
<i>- Two Horns, you got that?
- Yeah,</i> I can see <i>it</i> now.

01:16:00.974 --> 01:16:03.852
She's a little tight, but I'll make it fit.

01:16:39.429 --> 01:16:40.514
Fire all missiles.

01:17:10.585 --> 01:17:12.921
<i>- Are you on?</i>
- Kind <i>of.</i>

01:17:13.088 --> 01:17:16.383
<i>- Where's Two Horns?</i>
- I <i>don't know.</i>

01:17:19.594 --> 01:17:22.806
<i>I couldn't get close enough, but you're in my range.</i>

01:17:22.973 --> 01:17:25.267
<i>I'll back you up from here.</i>

01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:29.229
<i>Directly behind the main cannon.
Can you see it?</i>

01:17:29.396 --> 01:17:33.441
<i>There's an exterior shield.
It's not finished. That's your in.</i>

01:17:41.074 --> 01:17:46.413
<i>Yes. If you can take out those defensive
gun turrets, you've got</i> a <i>clear path.</i>

01:17:46.621 --> 01:17:48.165
<i>You can do it.</i>

01:18:33.210 --> 01:18:36.504
- Thanks for dropping in.
- Two Horns?

01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:45.180
Can you throw me into that hole?

01:18:49.142 --> 01:18:51.645
You think I'm heavy?

01:18:52.437 --> 01:18:55.774
That's another debt you owe me!

01:19:11.248 --> 01:19:12.540
Leave it alone.

01:19:12.707 --> 01:19:15.919
I thought you only wanted
to control the weapon, not use it.

01:19:16.086 --> 01:19:18.004
I've changed my mind.

01:19:18.171 --> 01:19:21.424
There are people up there.
People you claim you want to help.

01:19:21.591 --> 01:19:22.968
And I can help!

01:19:23.134 --> 01:19:25.762
Once they understand the power I wield.

01:19:26.304 --> 01:19:27.847
It'll never work.

01:19:28.014 --> 01:19:31.309
I shot the last person that said that.

01:19:31.476 --> 01:19:34.479
Then I threw him out of a plane.

01:19:34.646 --> 01:19:36.648
Do you think he is still alive'?

01:19:36.815 --> 01:19:39.442
Do you?

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.535
Deunan.

01:19:52.163 --> 01:19:54.874
- I thought you were dead.
- That makes two of us.

01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:57.794
And Briareos?

01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:01.131
Oh, come on. What do you think?

01:20:01.298 --> 01:20:03.008
Good.

01:20:04.301 --> 01:20:06.845
I didn't want to cause you two any more trouble.

01:20:07.304 --> 01:20:10.432
Trouble? You and Olson...

01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:14.602
You gave us purpose.

01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:26.072
Any way to stop this thing?

01:20:26.239 --> 01:20:27.866
I'm trying.

01:20:28.033 --> 01:20:30.201
I'm the one that made it come alive.

01:20:30.368 --> 01:20:33.330
No, you didn't. Talos did.

01:20:33.496 --> 01:20:37.292
This Fortress won't stop until it reaches New York City.

01:20:37.459 --> 01:20:39.669
Once it gets there, it will self-destruct.

01:20:41.463 --> 01:20:42.881
What?

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:46.384
This weapon is programmed for retribution.

01:20:46.551 --> 01:20:48.053
Why?

01:20:48.219 --> 01:20:51.014
In case the country fell to its enemy.

01:20:53.892 --> 01:20:56.311
- I know a way.
- What?

01:20:56.478 --> 01:20:58.688
Can we talk to Briareos?

01:21:02.359 --> 01:21:05.862
Got it. Eight minutes on the money.
Generator at point-blank range.

01:21:06.029 --> 01:21:07.238
- Take my shot.
- Yeah.

01:21:07.405 --> 01:21:10.533
Yes. Remember,
we only have one chance.

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:12.118
<i>One's all I need.</i>

01:21:12.285 --> 01:21:14.496
- Where's Deunan?
- She's here.

01:21:14.662 --> 01:21:16.539
We finish this.

01:21:16.998 --> 01:21:18.875
For Olson.

01:21:42.065 --> 01:21:44.401
Fortress right on course.

01:21:46.778 --> 01:21:48.405
Almost in position.

01:21:49.322 --> 01:21:50.740
You're the last one.

01:21:50.907 --> 01:21:52.909
Go out big, baby.

01:21:53.076 --> 01:21:57.664
If we take out one more cannon, it should
create a large enough opening for you.

01:22:08.049 --> 01:22:09.926
- It worked.
- Yeah.

01:22:13.888 --> 01:22:16.182
No, it didn't.

01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:43.418
<i>Briareos, can you see the target?</i>

01:22:43.585 --> 01:22:45.295
Fifteen more seconds.

01:22:45.462 --> 01:22:47.464
Get the hell out of there now.

01:23:05.607 --> 01:23:06.900
Deunan.

01:23:23.625 --> 01:23:25.335
Iris, I can see the generator.

01:23:25.502 --> 01:23:27.462
Get out of there now.

01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:29.589
<i>What's happening? Deunan?</i>

01:23:30.006 --> 01:23:31.591
Iris, open the door.

01:23:33.801 --> 01:23:35.178
We gotta get out, now.

01:23:38.598 --> 01:23:41.851
What's going on? Open it, now.

01:23:42.393 --> 01:23:46.773
This machine will regenerate its shields
unless I stay and keep them down.

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:48.233
No, get out.

01:23:48.399 --> 01:23:51.611
What's the status?
I'm losing my window.

01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:58.701
Bri needs a clear shot.
I can give it to him.

01:23:58.868 --> 01:24:01.704
We'll find another way. Please.

01:24:02.872 --> 01:24:04.832
I am a bioroid.

01:24:04.999 --> 01:24:07.210
I was made for this mission.

01:24:07.377 --> 01:24:10.713
No. No, please.

01:24:12.966 --> 01:24:14.717
Good bye.

01:24:26.354 --> 01:24:27.397
<i>We're out.</i>

01:24:27.564 --> 01:24:29.524
Well done, Iris.

01:25:07.854 --> 01:25:10.690
There's so much I wanted to tell you.

01:25:13.359 --> 01:25:15.612
You gave me a reason.

01:25:17.697 --> 01:25:19.866
You gave me hope.

01:26:01.741 --> 01:26:03.743
So, what's the take?

01:26:04.619 --> 01:26:06.162
Not much.

01:26:09.123 --> 01:26:13.544
Deunan, she died for something she believed in.

01:26:13.711 --> 01:26:16.798
Knowing that doesn't make it any easier.

01:26:17.757 --> 01:26:19.759
It never does.

01:26:37.902 --> 01:26:41.322
So where you off to now?

01:26:43.116 --> 01:26:45.326
To find Olympus.

01:26:45.493 --> 01:26:47.453
Olympus?

01:26:47.787 --> 01:26:51.416
Turns out you are funny. Who knew?

01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:56.087
- You know, we still have a debt to settle.
- You have got to be joking.

01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:59.590
Do I look like someone who jokes?

01:27:07.932 --> 01:27:11.436
Just my way of saying thanks for getting my city back.

01:27:16.315 --> 01:27:19.360
- I thought it was destroyed.
- Nothing I couldn't handle.

01:27:25.825 --> 01:27:27.535
Now, drive carefully.

01:27:27.702 --> 01:27:29.620
Traffic has been terrible lately.

01:27:29.787 --> 01:27:31.330
Oh, and wear your seat belt.

01:27:31.497 --> 01:27:34.041
I hear there was a law once.

01:27:53.728 --> 01:27:55.438
Think Two Horns has changed?

01:27:56.647 --> 01:27:57.982
Do you?

01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:59.275
I guess not.

01:27:59.442 --> 01:28:02.153
Well, there's always hope.

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.780
Hope.

01:28:04.655 --> 01:28:06.741
What a concept.

01:32:35.885 --> 01:32:37.636
We lost Iris.

01:32:37.803 --> 01:32:39.889
I know she was your bioroid.

01:32:40.056 --> 01:32:41.807
I'm sorry.

01:32:41.974 --> 01:32:45.436
She died in service of Olympus.
It was a noble death.

01:32:45.603 --> 01:32:47.938
- And her mission?
- It is complete.

01:32:48.105 --> 01:32:50.274
The prototype is destroyed.

01:32:50.441 --> 01:32:54.236
And the humans who helped, should we retrieve them?

01:32:55.988 --> 01:32:59.492
No, not yet.

01:33:01.118 --> 01:33:02.995
They are like appleseeds.

01:33:03.162 --> 01:33:06.165
Wherever they go, hope will sprout.

01:33:06.332 --> 01:33:09.585
Others who are worthy are sure to follow.
