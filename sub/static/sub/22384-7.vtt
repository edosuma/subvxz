00:10.552 --> 00:14.014
Mama? It's me. Jane.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.391
I'm home.

00:17.183 --> 00:18.268
No.

00:18.643 --> 00:19.643
Breathe.

00:19.811 --> 00:20.811
Sunflower.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.146
Rainbow.

00:23.398 --> 00:26.192
- Four-fifty. Three to the right...
- Breathe.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.111
Four to the left. Sunflower.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.988
- Four-fifty. Rainbow.
- Breathe.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.031
- Three to the right. Four to the left.
- Breathe.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.634
Four-fifty. Sunflower. Rainbow.

00:38.079 --> 00:41.166
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.627
Three to the right. Four to the left.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.465
Okay. You okay?

00:48.548 --> 00:51.092
And it just kept repeating?

00:52.635 --> 00:53.762
Repeat?

00:53.845 --> 00:57.891
Like a circle? Just showing you
the same image over and over?

00:57.974 --> 01:00.935
She kept showing the girl in the room.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.063
The rainbow room?

01:07.400 --> 01:08.651
What did the girl look like?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.990
- Different.
- Different than you?

01:17.368 --> 01:19.746
I think this is why Mama wanted to talk.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.165
To show you the girl?

01:31.257 --> 01:33.384
I think she wants me to find her.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.765
When Terry was looking for you,

01:38.848 --> 01:42.227
she kept these files
of other missing kids.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.771
Kids she thought were like you.

01:46.815 --> 01:52.695
Maybe that girl is in here somewhere.

01:52.779 --> 01:53.779
Here.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.919
Does anyone look familiar?

02:22.392 --> 02:23.935
Is that her?

02:42.662 --> 02:44.497
Did you find her?

02:48.418 --> 02:49.711
No.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.514
Hello?

03:58.821 --> 04:01.491
Becky! Becky, I found her.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.577
I just...
I didn't know who else to call.

04:04.661 --> 04:08.706
He gave me this number,
and he came here looking for her.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.792
I thought maybe he could help me.

04:10.875 --> 04:15.922
Yeah, Jim Hopper, he came here
with some woman named Joyce Byers?

04:17.298 --> 04:20.134
Well, that's a little hard to explain.
Uh...

04:20.218 --> 04:24.806
There's another girl, and she's missing,
and I think she's in trouble.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.600
I just... I didn't know who to call.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.186
Thank you, thank you. And you are?

04:30.895 --> 04:32.772
Florence...

04:34.899 --> 04:36.985
I'm gonna have to call you back.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.868
Jane? Jane?

04:46.786 --> 04:48.496
Jane?

04:49.163 --> 04:50.164

08:43.648 --> 08:46.651
You should do stand-up, Axe.
There's a spot a few blocks away.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.027
Hello?

08:49.237 --> 08:51.155
Well, well...

08:52.532 --> 08:54.033
What do we have here?

08:54.116 --> 08:56.077
What is she wearing?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.662
What are those, overalls?

08:57.745 --> 08:59.914
There aren't any cows
to milk here, kid.

09:00.414 --> 09:01.666
Go on back to the farm now.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.417
I'm looking for my sister.

09:03.876 --> 09:07.713
Aw... Shirley Temple lost her sister.
So sad.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.424
I saw her. Here.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.387
Uh-uh. Hand out of pocket. Slow.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.557
Give me that shit.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.106
- Is that Kali?
- Kali?

09:25.189 --> 09:26.649
How did you find us?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.860
- Who else knows you're here?
- No one.

09:29.944 --> 09:33.823
So, what then? Poof! You just show up
like magic with that picture?

09:33.906 --> 09:35.408
Stay calm. She's just a kid.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.034
A kid who could get us all killed.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.371
If I have to ask again, Shirley,
you'll start losing things.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.614
Starting with those pretty little locks
of yours. Yeah?

09:42.665 --> 09:44.041
Come on, Axe. Put down the knife.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.543
How did you find us?

09:45.626 --> 09:46.544
- I saw her.
- Axe!

09:46.627 --> 09:47.627
That's not an answer.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.050
Jesus. Jesus Christ!

09:57.430 --> 09:58.723
Get off! Shit! Shit!

09:58.806 --> 10:01.350
You're a terrible dancer, Axel.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.566
I told you, stay out of my head.

10:08.649 --> 10:11.027
So, we're threatening little girls now,
are we?

10:11.652 --> 10:14.196
- She knows about you.
- She had this.

10:18.659 --> 10:19.869
Where did you get this?

10:22.330 --> 10:23.330
Mama.

10:24.081 --> 10:25.875
Your mother gave this to you?

10:26.250 --> 10:27.668
In her dream circle.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.047
Dream circle.
I think she's a schizo or something.

10:31.130 --> 10:34.342
- Says she's looking for her sister.
- Yeah. Like I said, schizo.

10:35.384 --> 10:36.385
Jesus!

10:41.223 --> 10:42.683
I saw you.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.685
In the rainbow room.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.482
What is your name?

10:50.524 --> 10:51.692
Jane.

11:08.959 --> 11:09.959
Sister.

11:12.254 --> 11:13.422
Sister.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.777
And this memory
your mother shared...

11:35.695 --> 11:37.446
that is your only memory of me?

11:39.198 --> 11:40.282
Yes.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.035
And how long have you been
with this policeman?

11:43.119 --> 11:44.879
Three hundred
and twenty-seven days.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.789
And this policeman, he thinks

11:46.872 --> 11:50.251
he can work out some sort of deal
with these men to set you free?

11:50.334 --> 11:51.252
Yes.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.421
- He says soon.
- He's naïve then.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.507
We'll always be monsters to them.
Do you understand?

11:58.426 --> 12:02.638
Let me guess. Your policeman,
he also stops you from using your gifts?

12:03.973 --> 12:07.184
What you can do is incredible.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.854
It makes you very special, Jane.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.021
Wait.

12:12.982 --> 12:16.110
- Do you have a gift?
- Different.

12:16.193 --> 12:20.322
I can make people see, or not see,
whatever I choose.

12:20.406 --> 12:24.368
Is that why you made the man
with the crazy hair dance?

12:24.952 --> 12:29.540
- Axel is not so fond of spiders, so...
- You made him see spiders?

12:31.876 --> 12:33.753
But it doesn't have to be scary.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.592
This butterfly, it isn't real.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.887
I've just convinced your mind it is.

12:45.890 --> 12:49.185
Think of it as a kind of magic.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.573
Are you real?

13:02.656 --> 13:04.325
Yes, I'm real.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.807
What's wrong?

13:29.934 --> 13:31.560
Nothing is wrong.

13:34.355 --> 13:38.651
I just feel... whole... now.

13:38.734 --> 13:42.613
Like... a piece of me was missing,

13:44.240 --> 13:45.574
and now it's not.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.868
Does that make sense?

13:49.370 --> 13:50.704
Yes.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.541
I think your mother sent you here
for a reason.

13:54.124 --> 13:57.336
I think she somehow knew
that we belong together.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.548
I think this is your home.

14:02.132 --> 14:03.509
Home.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.720
Yes. Home.

14:11.183 --> 14:15.396
This is car 13,
responding to a 245 at 31 Ashbury.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.817
...suspect under surveillance.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.028
Shit.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.994
How's your white hick sister?
You tuck her in real tight?

14:30.077 --> 14:32.830
Yeah, what about a lullaby?
Did you sing her one?

14:32.913 --> 14:36.250
- ♪ Old MacDonald had a farm ♪
- Yeah.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.460
♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪

14:38.544 --> 14:42.172
♪ And on his farm he had a cow ♪

14:42.256 --> 14:43.549
She found me with only this.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.553
What's that mean?

14:47.636 --> 14:50.222
It means she can find people
without moving.

14:50.681 --> 14:51.932
With nothing but an image.

14:52.516 --> 14:55.477
You telling me Shirley's a human
radar detector or some shit?

14:55.561 --> 14:56.979
Or some shit, yes.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.647
Come on. No way.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.149
We'll find out soon enough.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.401
I want to do one. Tomorrow.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.486
- You serious, Kal?
- We're way too hot right now.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.570
Paranoid.

15:05.613 --> 15:09.992
Realistic. You don't kill their men
and expect them to look the other way.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.453
If they find us, they will unleash hell.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.621
So we give in to fear?

15:14.538 --> 15:17.207
She's in pain. She needs this.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.377
We go out tomorrow.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.091
Swear to God,
Shirley Temple's gonna get us all killed.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.434
It's me.

15:40.022 --> 15:43.108
I know that I've been gone too long,
and, uh...

15:46.654 --> 15:49.823
I just want you to know
that it's not because of you.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.242
And it's not because of our fight.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.455
Something came up,

15:56.538 --> 16:01.794
and, uh, I'll explain everything soon.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.253
I just, um...

16:04.463 --> 16:08.550
I want you to know that I'm not...
I'm not mad at you. I...

16:10.469 --> 16:12.596
I'm just sorry.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.725
It's okay. It's only me.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.229
Bad dream?

16:20.312 --> 16:21.897
What time is it?

16:22.481 --> 16:23.524
It's late.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.067
You slept well. Come.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.861
It's time you meet my friends.
Properly this time.

16:34.076 --> 16:37.705
We need more money, Kal.
I can't keep eating this garbage.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.416
- This is Axel.
- The spider hater?

16:40.499 --> 16:42.626
Yes, the spider hater.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.420
This is Dottie, our newest.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.213
Like you, she just left home.

16:46.296 --> 16:50.384
- You mean the loony bin.
- Mick, our eyes, our protector.

16:50.467 --> 16:53.387
This is Funshine, our warrior.

16:54.263 --> 16:57.683
Don't let his size frighten you.
Fun's a teddy bear.

16:57.766 --> 16:59.476
Nice to meet you, Miss Jane.

17:01.395 --> 17:04.064
If you're looking for a number,
you won't find one.

17:05.773 --> 17:07.443
They're not like us.

17:07.526 --> 17:11.320
No, not in that way.
But like us, they're outcasts.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.614
Outcasts?

17:12.698 --> 17:14.825
- Freaks.
- Speak for yourself.

17:14.907 --> 17:19.163
Society left them behind,
hurt them, discarded them.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.330
We were dead, all of us.

17:22.165 --> 17:26.170
Kali saved us. Here. And here.

17:26.252 --> 17:28.255
Don't get all mushy on us now, Fun.

17:28.338 --> 17:31.300
No, not mushy. True.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.509
Now we help her.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.596
In this life, kid,
you roll over or you fight back.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.556
We're all fighters here.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.641
Fight who?

17:42.561 --> 17:45.147
Everyone you see here was
in some way responsible

17:45.230 --> 17:46.356
for what happened to us.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.820
You hurt the bad men?

17:51.904 --> 17:54.907
No, we just give 'em a pat on the back.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.581
You kill them?

18:03.207 --> 18:06.251
They're criminals.
We simply make them pay for their crimes.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.003
Boom.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.257
Damn, Shirley. What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.301
We can't all be fighters, I guess.

18:14.885 --> 18:18.055
I'm a fighter. I've killed.

18:21.183 --> 18:25.813
These men you killed, did they deserve it?

18:26.355 --> 18:28.107
They hurt me.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.944
And they still want to hurt you.
To hurt us.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.113
We're just making the first move.

18:34.738 --> 18:35.823
Come.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.661
I was just like you once.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.330
I kept my anger inside.

18:43.956 --> 18:48.085
I tried to hide from it,
but then that pain festered.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.671
Festered?

18:53.799 --> 18:54.800
It spread.

18:55.425 --> 19:00.055
Until finally I confronted my pain,
and I began to heal.

19:09.189 --> 19:12.109
- Do you see that train?
- Yes.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.361
I want you to draw it to us.

19:49.897 --> 19:50.897
I can't.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.859
Last night you told me
you lifted a van once.

19:55.819 --> 19:56.945
Yes.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.739
The bad men were trying
to take you again,

19:58.822 --> 20:00.449
and that made you angry.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.952
Good. So, find that anger,

20:04.036 --> 20:07.623
focus on that, not the train,
not its weight.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.465
I want you to find something
from your life.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.468
Something that angers you.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.055
Now channel it.

20:25.641 --> 20:28.936
Dig deeper.
Your whole life you've been lied to...

20:29.019 --> 20:31.063
- Do I have a mother?
- She's not around anymore.

20:34.733 --> 20:35.776
...imprisoned.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.487
Don't walk away from me!
Grow the hell up!

20:41.281 --> 20:43.158
The bad men took away your home,

20:44.743 --> 20:45.827
your mother...

20:47.871 --> 20:48.997
Jane.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.543
They took everything from you.

20:53.627 --> 20:54.628
Papa!

20:54.711 --> 20:56.838
They stole your life, Jane.

20:57.589 --> 20:58.632
I want you to find them.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.523
Yeah!

21:14.606 --> 21:16.566
Yeah, Jane!

21:21.989 --> 21:23.073
So, how do you feel?

21:25.575 --> 21:27.077
Good.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.001
These are the bad men, as you call them.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.504
The one's we believe are still alive.
Do you know any?

21:46.054 --> 21:47.055
Him.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.351
Four-fifty...

21:54.438 --> 21:55.647
He hurt Mama.

21:55.731 --> 21:59.818
His name is Ray Caroll.
And he did more than hurt your mother.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.323
The bad men like Ray, they know about us.

22:04.406 --> 22:08.368
It's made them hard to track.
But maybe not anymore.

22:42.944 --> 22:46.156
"Gramercy Apartments.
Washington and Bethel."

22:46.239 --> 22:47.365
That's gotta be it. Right?

22:47.449 --> 22:50.452
- "Lilburn." Where is that?
- About an hour east.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.287
We don't even have a new ride.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.456
So we swap plates.
We have plates, right?

22:54.539 --> 22:56.374
- Yeah.
- It's risky.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.335
Where's the fun if there's no risk?

22:59.169 --> 23:01.505
We want to give my sister
a memorable first day, right?

23:01.588 --> 23:03.673
I'm in. For Miss Jane.

23:03.757 --> 23:07.594
Yeah, sure. Why not? Mick?

23:11.890 --> 23:12.890
Screw it!

23:43.421 --> 23:44.422
Bitchin'.

23:45.632 --> 23:46.633
Bitchin'.

24:03.483 --> 24:06.236
Get off me! Get off me!

24:54.868 --> 24:55.952
What are we doing?

24:56.453 --> 24:57.454
Stocking up.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.461
Hey, your bathroom is leaking.

25:05.962 --> 25:07.464
Oh, shit.

25:07.547 --> 25:08.548
Yes.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.341
Shit.

25:13.428 --> 25:16.389
Okay, contestants,
you have a minute and a half,

25:16.473 --> 25:18.725
let's begin your supermarket sweep!

25:40.372 --> 25:44.751
Hey! Put that back,
or I'll blow your head off.

25:45.377 --> 25:49.047
- You hear me, freak?
- Put the gun down.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.757
Stay back. Stay back.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.718
Darrel, your money is insured.

25:53.802 --> 25:58.515
We're only stealing from the war criminal
billionaires who own this place.

25:58.598 --> 26:01.017
- You won't even lose a dime.
- I said stay back.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.687
We're on the same side.

26:03.770 --> 26:07.565
- I promise.
- Stay back.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.323
Damn, Shirley.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.951
Let's go! Go! Go, go, go, go!

26:18.618 --> 26:20.662
Mick! We gotta go, Mick!

26:47.439 --> 26:51.526
We should case the place,
stick to the routine. We have time.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.321
We also have her. Can you look?

27:05.206 --> 27:08.209
- He's watching television.
- Is he alone?

27:08.793 --> 27:12.130
I saw him. No one else.

27:12.839 --> 27:15.425
- Good enough for me.
- Me, too.

27:15.508 --> 27:16.426
Let's do this.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.219
- Keep it running.
- Meet you around back.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.531
Punky, what's the matter?

27:38.615 --> 27:39.615
A nightmare.

27:39.657 --> 27:42.660
I dreamt I was in the doctor's office.

27:42.744 --> 27:46.873
All of a sudden, he's started to give me
my shot in my arm.

27:46.956 --> 27:51.127
Then the needle got bigger
and bigger and bigger...

28:07.268 --> 28:08.478
Hello, Ray.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.190
Jesus Christ!

28:13.066 --> 28:16.277
Sit down. Please.

28:16.903 --> 28:18.613
- I said sit.
- Please...

28:19.697 --> 28:22.992
Just, please... just take what you want.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.702
Oh, we will.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.538
Where's your wallet?

28:26.621 --> 28:29.707
- Bedroom. My bedroom. My jeans.
- Come on.

28:31.668 --> 28:32.836
Yes.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.588
Got it.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.984
Do you remember us?

29:02.574 --> 29:05.243
What about us?
Do you remember us, Ray?

29:09.748 --> 29:11.666
Please. Please.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.377
You hurt Mama.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.676
Wait.

29:22.218 --> 29:23.386
Please. Listen...

29:25.263 --> 29:27.223
I just did what he told me to do.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.560
He said she was sick.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.937
You had a choice, Ray.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.815
And you chose to follow a man
you knew was evil.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.485
No, wait! No, wait! Wait!

29:39.194 --> 29:43.198
I can help. I can help you find him.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.617
- Find who?
- Brenner!

29:45.700 --> 29:48.203
I can take you to him.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.538
Papa is gone.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.582
No, he is alive.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.251
Do not lie to us, Ray.

29:55.335 --> 29:56.795
I'm not lying!

29:57.629 --> 30:00.381
I swear...

30:00.465 --> 30:01.549
He trusts me.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.095
I'll take you to him.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.014
If he's alive, Jane will find him.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.849
Just as she found you.

30:10.433 --> 30:11.518
Do it, Jane.

30:13.436 --> 30:14.646
- Do it.
- Wait.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.113
Not too quick.

30:24.197 --> 30:26.282
He wasn't so generous with your mother.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.188
Sweetie, just stay calm.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.678
Oh, shit!

30:46.761 --> 30:48.888
The police are on their way, honey. Okay?

30:56.354 --> 30:57.772
What's wrong?

30:58.523 --> 31:00.149
- What's wrong?
- We got a problem.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.819
Kids in the apartment.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.280
Please...

31:05.363 --> 31:08.575
- Did he show your mother mercy? No.
- Please. No.

31:09.200 --> 31:13.371
- I'm sorry.
- He took her from you, without hesitation.

31:13.454 --> 31:15.331
Please don't. Please.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.667
We got to go, K.
They called the cops.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.919
We finish this first.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.170
- Kali!
- Jane, now!

31:21.880 --> 31:23.131
Please, don't...

31:23.214 --> 31:25.383
Please. Please.

31:33.975 --> 31:35.435
Kali, we gotta go!

31:42.400 --> 31:43.840
- Shit!
- Go, go, go!

31:45.153 --> 31:46.195
Shit!

31:46.863 --> 31:48.281
Come on. Get in!

31:52.493 --> 31:54.787
If you wanted to show mercy,
that is your choice.

31:54.871 --> 31:58.291
But don't you ever take away mine. Ever.

31:58.374 --> 32:01.252
Do you understand? Do you understand?

32:14.891 --> 32:17.435
I see you, and I raise you ten.

32:18.311 --> 32:19.979
How ya like that?

32:24.442 --> 32:27.737
That was a mistake right there, girl.
A mistake.

32:27.820 --> 32:30.031
I think you're full of shit.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.303
May I sit?

33:02.146 --> 33:04.774
I was once just like you, you know that?

33:05.692 --> 33:10.446
But that's why I'm hard on you,
because I see in you my past mistakes.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.366
They were kids.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.412
Does that excuse that man's sins?
Were we not also children?

33:19.580 --> 33:23.793
I remember the day I came
to the rainbow room and you were gone.

33:24.919 --> 33:28.423
So, when my gifts were strong enough,
I used them to escape.

33:28.506 --> 33:29.632
And I ran.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.759
I ran away as far as I could.

33:33.761 --> 33:38.808
And it was there, far away,
that I found a place to hide.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.644
A family.

33:43.229 --> 33:44.229
A home.

33:45.898 --> 33:47.650
Just like you and your policeman.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.903
But they couldn't help me.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.240
So, eventually, I lost them, too.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.205
So, I decided to play the part.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.666
To stop hiding.

34:03.750 --> 34:06.544
To use my gifts against those who hurt us.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.297
You're now faced
with the same choice, Jane.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.926
Go back into hiding
and hope they don't find you.

34:14.635 --> 34:16.888
Fight, and face them again.

34:16.971 --> 34:18.222
Face who?

34:19.223 --> 34:21.559
The man who calls himself our father.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.855
Papa is dead.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.578
That man tonight disagreed.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.156
You're not real.

34:36.824 --> 34:39.827
All this time?
And you haven't looked for me?

34:40.786 --> 34:41.786
Why?

34:43.748 --> 34:45.333
Because you thought I was dead?

34:46.208 --> 34:48.628
Or because you were afraid
of what you might find?

34:49.670 --> 34:50.880
Go away.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.257
You have to confront your pain.

34:54.967 --> 34:58.679
You have a wound, Eleven,
a terrible wound.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.099
And it's festering.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.354
Do you remember
what that means? Festering?

35:07.313 --> 35:10.108
It means a rot.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.068
And it will grow.

35:13.778 --> 35:14.946
Spread.

35:15.988 --> 35:20.034
- Get out of my head.
- And eventually, it will kill you.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.246
Get out of my head!

35:34.674 --> 35:36.217
This isn't a prison, Jane.

35:36.801 --> 35:39.470
You're always free
to return to your policeman.

35:40.012 --> 35:42.723
Or stay, and avenge your mother.

35:44.517 --> 35:47.645
Let us heal our wounds together.

36:04.203 --> 36:07.373
- Full house.
- Screw this. I'm out.

36:07.456 --> 36:11.961
Out of money, you mean. You are broke!

36:14.547 --> 36:17.633
- You want in, Mick?
- Nope.

36:17.717 --> 36:22.096
- Aw, come on! Just one hand.
- You're the worst.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.347
How am I the worst?

36:23.431 --> 36:25.558
Because, one hand leads to two hands,

36:25.641 --> 36:29.145
two hands leads to three.
Before you know it, I'm as broke as Axel.

36:29.228 --> 36:31.022
- Are you in or out?
- Out.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.525
Today, tomorrow, the next day.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.714
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

36:57.882 --> 37:01.552
You'd better run!
She's our friend, and she's crazy!

37:01.636 --> 37:03.554
No, El, you're not the monster.

37:04.263 --> 37:07.767
You saved me, you understand?
You saved me.

37:08.142 --> 37:09.477
Compromise?

37:09.560 --> 37:13.022
It's something that's kind of
in between. Like halfway happy.

37:14.023 --> 37:17.443
Once we fix it up,
it's gonna be nice. Real nice.

37:18.152 --> 37:19.237
This is your new home.

37:40.591 --> 37:44.136
That's where I was.
It's a damn graveyard.

37:44.887 --> 37:48.015
I need to get through!
I need to get through!

37:48.099 --> 37:50.810
- Whoa! Whoa!
- I need to warn them. It's a trap!

37:50.893 --> 37:53.896
I need to get through. It's a trap.
I need to tell them it's a trap.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.983
- Mike!
- It's a trap! It's a trap!

37:57.775 --> 37:59.151
Mike!

37:59.235 --> 38:01.195
Mike! Mike!

38:01.279 --> 38:04.282
Mike! Mike, where are you?

38:04.365 --> 38:06.867
Mike! Mike!

38:15.918 --> 38:17.169
Go, go, go!

38:24.427 --> 38:25.427
Let's go.

38:26.262 --> 38:27.888
Don't move!

38:29.807 --> 38:31.726
- The hell's going on?
- They found us!

38:31.809 --> 38:33.436
- Jesus! Jesus Christ!
- No, no, no.

38:33.519 --> 38:34.729
Shh...

38:46.574 --> 38:49.327
- Spread left.
- Right.

39:13.893 --> 39:15.102
Let's go! Now!

39:15.186 --> 39:16.937
- Hey! Hey!
- Jane, come on!

39:17.855 --> 39:19.565
Come on, hurry!

39:20.483 --> 39:21.817
Look out! Look out!

39:27.698 --> 39:28.858
Get down! Get down!

39:33.662 --> 39:36.957
Do something, Kal.
Do something!

39:57.812 --> 39:58.896
Jane, get in.

40:00.272 --> 40:01.565
It's a damn graveyard.

40:01.649 --> 40:04.527
- Mike!
- It's a trap! It's a trap!

40:06.112 --> 40:09.532
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
but I have to go back.

40:10.324 --> 40:13.035
My friends... My friends are in danger.

40:13.119 --> 40:16.122
This isn't time for a talk.
We got to go right now!

40:17.832 --> 40:20.000
Your mother sent you here
for a reason, remember?

40:20.709 --> 40:22.503
We belong together.

40:22.586 --> 40:25.339
There's nothing for you back there.
They cannot save you, Jane.

40:26.173 --> 40:27.173
No.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.804
But I can save them.

40:36.392 --> 40:37.893
Jane. Jane!

40:39.145 --> 40:40.354
Jane!

40:40.438 --> 40:41.730
Jane!

40:57.788 --> 41:01.333
The hell was that? What's wrong with her?

41:21.312 --> 41:22.855
You all right, sweetie?

41:25.107 --> 41:28.819
You were looking a little forlorn there.
You mind if I join you?

41:34.408 --> 41:35.409
Hmm.

41:38.120 --> 41:43.250
You are awfully young
to be traveling alone, aren't you?

41:46.921 --> 41:49.089
Well, you are quite the chatterbox.
