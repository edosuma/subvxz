00:12.178 --> 00:15.807
Still no Lorenzo, huh?
He knows how I get when you guys are late.

00:16.057 --> 00:17.976
He doesn't want to see my angry face.

00:20.020 --> 00:24.232
Mr. Iglesias, you don't have what it takes
to make an angry face: anger.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.777
Yeah, your mad face
would be a lot more effective

00:27.861 --> 00:29.612
without those crazy cute dimples.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.448
[clicks tongue] Stop it.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.784
What's the big deal
about Lorenzo being late?

00:34.868 --> 00:36.453
So he misses a few minutes

00:36.536 --> 00:39.456
about the so-called "Great Depression."
[chuckles]

00:39.539 --> 00:41.666
Look, you guys don't think it's important
to be on time?

00:41.750 --> 00:43.334
What if Paul Revere had been late, huh?

00:43.418 --> 00:45.795
What would his wife have said?
[in colonial accent] "Oh, Paul.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.213
Wake up! Wake up!

00:47.297 --> 00:49.883
You must tell everyone
that the British are coming.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.134
The British are coming.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.512
Oh, is that musket fire?

00:54.846 --> 00:57.140
The British aren't coming,
the British are here!

00:57.223 --> 00:58.224
They're here!

01:00.268 --> 01:03.605
Oh, look, they look so handsome
in those red coats.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.232
Let me tighten my corset."

01:07.484 --> 01:10.195
Mrs. Revere sounds sexy as hell.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.948
She was a lot more handsome than sexy.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.952
Mr. Iglesias, it's--
it's not Lorenzo's fault he's not here.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.038
Well, I'm not one to gossip,

01:20.121 --> 01:23.374
but he's been having problems
with a tough, scary kid.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.668
What? Who would bully Lorenzo?

01:25.752 --> 01:26.795
I told him.

01:26.878 --> 01:30.298
Those skinny jeans and that fuzzy fade
weren't doing him any favors.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.384
You know,
I offered my bodyguarding services.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.303
For some reason, he didn't take 'em.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.013
Freakin' your funeral, dude.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.307
You know what they say, Mikey,

01:39.390 --> 01:41.518
it's not always the size of the dog
in the fight,

01:41.601 --> 01:43.645
it's the size of the fight in the dog.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.690
Yeah. And those people usually
get their asses kicked.

01:48.900 --> 01:49.776
A lot.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.865
All right, before I forget,
we gotta go over these handouts

01:55.949 --> 01:57.534
that the school board gave us.

01:57.617 --> 02:00.787
Let me guess,
a thousand photocopies about saving trees?

02:01.329 --> 02:05.667
No, actually, they want us
to start using inclusive language.

02:05.750 --> 02:09.504
For example, when I call you guys "guys,"
I should be calling you "students,"

02:09.587 --> 02:11.923
because some of you are ladies.

02:13.716 --> 02:15.468
Sorry, Lady-Americans.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.556
[sighs] Who needs more crazy rules?

02:19.889 --> 02:21.224
That's a perfect example, Walt.

02:21.307 --> 02:25.520
According to the school's new guidelines,
"crazy" is considered a derogatory term.

02:25.603 --> 02:28.398
I thought inclusive language had to do
with gender and orientation.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.817
Yeah, let's talk about sex!

02:32.694 --> 02:35.655
Walt, for five minutes,
how about we not talk about sex?

02:36.781 --> 02:38.408
The list has to do with that,

02:38.491 --> 02:41.244
plus abilities, nationality,
and ethnicity.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.746
So, take a look and be careful
what you say.

02:43.955 --> 02:46.749
No way. This is half of my vocabulary.

02:47.709 --> 02:51.045
Well, in that case,
that makes you a real number... 14.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.839
-[group chuckles]
-Ooh!

02:52.922 --> 02:53.965
Uncalled for.

02:54.632 --> 02:55.633
Didn't feel good, right?

02:55.925 --> 02:58.970
Hurts even more coming from...
a number six.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.224
Number six. Oh, that's my favorite combo
at Jack in the Box.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.145
-When's lunch?
-[bell rings]

03:07.687 --> 03:09.439
I did that with my mind!

03:10.773 --> 03:12.108
[theme song playing]

03:12.192 --> 03:13.693
♪ Mr. Iglesias ♪

03:16.654 --> 03:18.656
♪  Mr. Iglesias ♪

03:21.034 --> 03:24.871
Mr. Iglesias, this list is supposed
to help the campus feel more inclusive,

03:24.954 --> 03:26.039
but it leaves me out.

03:26.456 --> 03:31.377
How? I believe you fall under
the very desirable subcategory of Latinos,

03:31.753 --> 03:32.837
like me.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.466
You can't say Latinos.
The correct term is Latinx.

03:36.549 --> 03:37.759
"Latinx"?

03:38.301 --> 03:39.636
Sounds like a Mexican bug spray.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.015
It's not a joke, Mr. Iglesias.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.099
I thought it was funny.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.354
No, even though the school board
left it out of the little handout,

03:49.437 --> 03:51.231
that is the correct way to refer to us.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.399
[sighs] Look, you can't just make up
a word

03:53.483 --> 03:55.026
and force people to use it. 

03:55.109 --> 03:58.738
Believe me, I tried with the word
"redonkulous," and it did not catch on.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.492
Too many cultures have used the masculine
to refer to all people.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.286
That's messed up,
which is why the right word is Latinx.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.958
Look, that might be the right word today,
okay?

04:10.041 --> 04:11.668
But you gotta remember something, Marisol,

04:11.751 --> 04:14.379
I'm much older than you,
and I've already been through this.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.297
When I was born, on my birth certificate,

04:16.381 --> 04:19.008
there was only two options
to describe what I was.

04:19.092 --> 04:22.303
I was either Afro-American or Caucasian

04:22.387 --> 04:26.015
Now, clearly, I wasn't Afro-American,
so I was white by default.

04:26.307 --> 04:27.308
I had it made.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.021
I had a future of new words
like "homeowner,"

04:32.981 --> 04:34.148
"registered voter,"

04:35.400 --> 04:36.442
and then they changed it.

04:36.526 --> 04:41.030
They added a third box, so now,
it was "other," and there went my house.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.117
And I was "other" for a long time,

04:44.200 --> 04:47.078
and then they changed it to Hispanic
when I came out of the first grade,

04:47.161 --> 04:49.497
and I was cool with that.
But then my buddy Albert was like,

04:49.580 --> 04:52.333
"Dude, we're not Hispanic, bro,
we're Chicano."

04:54.419 --> 04:57.171
But that ended with Albert and me
being called "defendants."

04:59.257 --> 05:01.509
[sighs]
By the time they dropped the charges,

05:01.592 --> 05:02.927
we were Mexican-American.

05:03.761 --> 05:06.431
The point is, is that
all these different people got together,

05:06.514 --> 05:09.267
the Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Cubans,
Mexicans, Salvadorians,

05:09.350 --> 05:11.352
and the majority
of the Spanish-speaking countries,

05:11.436 --> 05:15.356
and they finally agreed on one word, 

05:15.773 --> 05:18.026
and that word was Latino.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.944
And it's been that way for decades.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.280
Even the Argentinians jumped on board.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.240
They don't agree with anyone!

05:25.366 --> 05:27.368
Now you want me
and millions of other people

05:27.452 --> 05:29.329
to start using this new word?

05:29.412 --> 05:30.496
Ah, I don't think so.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.915
A whole new one word.

05:33.833 --> 05:37.170
I'm sorry it's such an inconvenience,
but we're Latinx now,

05:37.253 --> 05:40.381
so everyone who doesn't identify as male
feels included.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.591
Come on, you can say it.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.052
Is it even proper Spanish? Or English?

05:44.177 --> 05:46.554
I bet you can't even tell me a word
that ends in "nx."

05:46.846 --> 05:48.556
Jinx, lynx, minx.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.060
Okay, a fourth word.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.853
Pharynx, larynx, phalanx.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.439
[sighs] English department is killing it.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.567
Just think about it.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.028
And, oh, yeah: sphynx.

06:02.695 --> 06:03.905
Well, that stinks.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.240
[Marisol] Doesn't have an x.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.749
Gabe, do you want 30 copies
of Huckleberry Finn?

06:14.832 --> 06:17.668
With the new language guidelines,
I can't teach this book anymore.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.380
I'm okay.
But you know who would love these?

06:20.463 --> 06:22.298
Mr. Ochoa in room 208.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.508
Okay.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.683
-Lorenzo.
-Not today, Satan!

06:33.726 --> 06:35.144
[panting]

06:35.353 --> 06:37.480
-It's just you, Mr. Iglesias.
-Yeah.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.024
-Hey.
-Yeah, it's just me. Were you, uh...

06:40.108 --> 06:41.401
Were you expecting somebody else?

06:41.484 --> 06:44.070
Like maybe the person who kicked
your books all over the floor?

06:44.195 --> 06:48.449
Oh! Uh, that was me.
Yeah, I was distracted.

06:48.699 --> 06:50.952
I think there was a mini-drone
following me.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.246
-Oh, okay.
-You know they're the size of bumble bees.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.372
"Oh, no!"

06:55.373 --> 06:57.625
Yeah, you know,
I'm-- I'm allergic to bees.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.336
And to, uh... BS.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.880
Why weren't you in class this morning?

07:03.339 --> 07:05.967
I was, uh...
observing a religious holiday.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.844
-Hmm.
-Yeah, yeah, it's called...

07:08.136 --> 07:10.847

Okay.

-Got a complicated family, you know.
-Yeah, me too.

07:17.061 --> 07:18.062
Um...

07:18.688 --> 07:20.565
Your classmates said
that you might have a bully.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.900
-What?
-[Gabe chuckles] Yeah.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.445
You don't have to be
the strong, silent type.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.363
You could be the strong tattletale type.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.907
Uh, no can do.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.536
In case you haven't heard,
snitches get stitches.

[stammers]
Sometimes, snitches get justice!

07:37.582 --> 07:40.334
Just because it doesn't rhyme
doesn't mean it's not true!

07:44.464 --> 07:45.715
How's it going, Gabe?

07:45.798 --> 07:47.675
-You look down.
-Yeah.

07:47.758 --> 07:51.012
I'm having a problem with Lorenzo
that not even pan dulce can fix.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.432
Is it about the moon landing
or the grassy knoll?

Lorenzo's got a bully.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.144
[gasps] No way.

07:58.227 --> 08:01.689
He's such a sweet,
soft-spoken little wisp of a thing.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.067
Oh, that is bully-bait.
I guess it's kind of on him.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.528
You do know how bullying works, right?

08:08.738 --> 08:10.031
I remember those days.

08:10.114 --> 08:12.116
Hiding from my bully
in the girls' bathroom.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.827
On the plus side,
it was kind of like paradise in there.

08:15.119 --> 08:16.120
Hmm.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.039
All the graffiti had hearts on the "I"s.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.583
-[Abby chuckles]
-And get this, the toilets had seats.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.421
You know,
I had a bully back in high school too.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.299
This new girl, Melissa,
she kept trying to sit at our table,

08:28.382 --> 08:30.092
and the only way
that I could get rid of her

08:30.176 --> 08:32.220
was to start an awful rumor about her.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.096
She didn't really have a tail.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.683
You do know you're the bully
in that story, right?

08:37.767 --> 08:40.311
Oh, no, no, no. I was just protecting her.

08:40.394 --> 08:43.105
I didn't want her to hear what
we were saying behind her back.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.066
So what do you think I should do, Tony?

08:46.275 --> 08:47.401
Well, the period's almost over.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.529
You could wait for the bully
by Lorenzo's locker.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.822

08:53.699 --> 08:54.784
You know, that figures.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.702
If it's one of my players,
I'll talk to him,

08:56.786 --> 08:58.371
make sure he's doing it right.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.582
Yeah, Coach,
that's just what we need more of.

Listen, I had a bully growing up,
and look how great I turned out, huh?

09:14.178 --> 09:15.012
Yeah, Coach.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.722
We definitely need to intervene.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.308
He should be so lucky.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.520

and I just beat a parking ticket.

with sodas?

Pop-a Cap-a In Your Ass-a?

Come on, she's not that threatening.

11:30.189 --> 11:34.110
I've dealt with a lot of bullies before,
but never ones with Sharpie eyebrows.

11:35.152 --> 11:36.320
Hey, Lorenzo, you okay?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.865
God, it's like the Mexican Conjuring.

-[in high-pitched voice] I'm cool.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.376
Are we gonna do something, Gabe?

11:50.459 --> 11:53.546
Damn right we are.
We're gonna go ask Paula what to do.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.882
[Paula]
It's always a joy to see you, Ms. Fuentes.

11:56.966 --> 12:01.011
Shall we continue with the pleasantries
or go straight to today's complaints?

12:01.095 --> 12:03.264
Oh, I'm going straight to the complaint.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.433
[Paula] Oh, God.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.644
I'm listening, but I might rest my eyes.

12:10.646 --> 12:13.524
I was reading our new
inclusive language guidelines,

12:13.607 --> 12:15.443
and it doesn't adequately represent
my people.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.903
You mean people who ruin my lunch?

12:18.612 --> 12:20.030
No, Latinx.

12:20.114 --> 12:23.200
Latino describes men,
and when you use it to describe a group,

12:23.284 --> 12:25.119
it leaves out everyone who's not a man.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.914
Wow.
I never thought of it that way, Marisol.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.708
I see where you're coming from.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.211
But I'm not in charge
of the Spanish language.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.714
You'll have to take your problems up
with Spain.

12:37.214 --> 12:41.051
Trust me, I've already left
a scathing takedown on Spain's Yelp page.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.099
-[sighs] Hey, Paula.
-Oh, gosh.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.560
Can a girl grab a bite
of her Lean Cuisine?

12:51.228 --> 12:52.354
What do you guys want?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.774
One of my students is having a problem
with a bully.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.442
"Bully," you say?

12:58.527 --> 13:01.489
I did say "bully."
I did not say "Beetlejuice" three times.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.826
Uh, what is going on with this bully,
Gabe?

13:05.910 --> 13:09.622
Well, I didn't see much, because I fled
to safety, but it involved Lorenzo Webber.

13:09.705 --> 13:13.459
Really? He's so puny.
I'm surprised he could scare anyone.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.877
He's the victim, okay?

13:14.960 --> 13:17.463
He's being jittery, anxious,
talking nonsense.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.924
So he's being himself. A-boom!

13:22.468 --> 13:24.386
And you're being yourself. A-bummer!

13:26.347 --> 13:27.681
Come on, man, this is serious.

13:27.765 --> 13:30.142
I have zero tolerance for bullies.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.270
Boys with too much testosterone
taking out their anger

13:33.354 --> 13:34.563
on innocent students.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.815
Who is this punk?

13:36.774 --> 13:37.650
Rita Perez.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.278
Wait, a girl is bullying Lorenzo?

13:41.362 --> 13:43.781
[laughing]

13:43.864 --> 13:47.701
-That is hilarious.
-You don't know what to do either, do you?

13:48.869 --> 13:51.330
Rita's tough.
She pushed him up against a wall.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.082
It gave me flashbacks.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.877
And then she pulled him down the hall.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.922
According to the HR pamphlet,
the Bad Touch Bear would be frowning.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.967
That bear is such a bummer.

14:04.093 --> 14:08.013
So, we have menacing,
intimidation, potential kidnapping.

14:08.097 --> 14:11.934
I can convict her on all these counts. 
She's gonna be sorry she ever met me.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.102
We all are.

14:15.604 --> 14:16.772
Heel, Carlos.

14:17.398 --> 14:21.360
A girl bullying a boy?
Get out of my office with this mess.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.322
Well, someone should talk to Rita
about her language,

14:25.406 --> 14:29.034
because I heard her call him... negrito.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.662
Negrito? Oh, wait, hell no.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.914
-Negrito?
-Paula, look, look,

14:33.998 --> 14:35.082
I know what it sounds like,

14:35.165 --> 14:37.042
but in reality,
that part's not a big deal.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.169
Gabe, who do you think you're talking to?

14:39.253 --> 14:42.840
-I know a racial slur when I hear one.
-Paula, in Spanish, it's not a slur.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.633
Yeah, it's actually a term of endearment.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.677
-Really? What does it mean?
-Mm-hmm.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.096
Translate it for me, in English.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.139
Um...

14:50.222 --> 14:51.265
-Technically?
-Literally.

14:51.348 --> 14:52.224
Little blackie.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.309
What?!

14:54.685 --> 14:55.603
What?

14:56.228 --> 14:58.314
Carlos, you tell Rita Perez
she is suspended

14:58.397 --> 15:00.816
for violating our inclusive
language guidelines

15:00.900 --> 15:02.526
and for pissing me the hell off.

15:03.027 --> 15:03.861
Yes!

15:04.820 --> 15:06.363
I'll start the proceedings.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.490
I knew today was gonna be a great day.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.292
I do want Rita to stop hassling Lorenzo,

15:18.375 --> 15:21.003
but she shouldn't be suspended
for using a cute nickname.

15:21.295 --> 15:25.299
Okay? There's thousands of songs on iTunes
that have that word in the lyrics.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.885
Here's a lyric: "Mama don't care."

15:29.094 --> 15:30.763
Not in my house.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.932
I bet there's a couple names
I could call you

15:33.015 --> 15:34.391
that would make you feel like crap.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.145
Yeah, and if you did that,
you'd be a real number... 13.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.524
Thirteen? What is 13? Where is that?
Thirteen...

15:42.775 --> 15:43.817
[Gabe] Bye.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.111
Not on your best day!

15:50.908 --> 15:51.951
Hey, Marisol.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.497
Did Principal Madison agree
to add your word to the list?

15:56.580 --> 15:59.792
You mean my made-up word
that will be obsolete before I graduate?

15:59.875 --> 16:03.212
Did my face say that? Because I know
those words didn't come out of my mouth.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.757
Look, Mr. Iglesias,
I'm not surprised you didn't get it,

16:06.840 --> 16:09.426
but I really thought Principal Madison
would understand.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.471
But in her defense, she doesn't like me.

16:15.224 --> 16:18.018
So since she didn't go for it,
am I kinda off the hook?

16:18.435 --> 16:20.729
You know Latino isn't exactly a bad word.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.981
It's exclusive.

16:22.189 --> 16:25.025
Of course, you don't mind gender bias
in language

16:25.109 --> 16:27.152
because the bias
is in your gender's favor.

16:27.778 --> 16:28.779
[silently mouths] Yes.

16:31.573 --> 16:34.284
It's just nice to get a W
every once in a while.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.745
[scoffs] Well, I'm still waiting for mine.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.750
I know the lady that made this.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.627
I can get you one.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.883
I can't believe I sentenced Rita
to cruel and unusual punishment:

16:49.967 --> 16:51.135
having to hang out with Carlos.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.264
Oh, my God, what if she retaliates?

16:55.556 --> 16:58.017
Think I can file a restraining order
against a 16-year-old girl?

16:59.643 --> 17:03.480
Don't worry, if anybody needs protection,
I know Krav Maga.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.232
That's Israeli ninja fighting.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.985
[grunting]

17:08.235 --> 17:09.319
Shalom.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.575
You are a complicated lady.

17:14.658 --> 17:15.951
[chuckles]

17:16.577 --> 17:19.038
I just don't feel right about getting Rita
kicked out of school.

17:19.621 --> 17:24.084
Aw, Gabert, just go talk to Lorenzo,
then you'll see you did the right thing.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.086
I bet he'll be so grateful.

17:26.170 --> 17:29.590
Are you out of your mind? How could you?

17:29.673 --> 17:31.717
Look, man,
if there's one thing I know about women,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.218
it's that they never hold grudges.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.806
I can't even say that
with a straight face.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.267
You just ruined my whole life.

17:40.350 --> 17:43.312
Rita doesn't hate me, Mr. Iglesias,
she likes me.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.023
Well, she's gonna have to learn
to take no for an answer.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.358
Wh--
What do you mean, "take no for an answer"?

17:48.442 --> 17:51.111
I never said no. Trying to say yes,

17:51.195 --> 17:52.654
just don't know how.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.948
Dude, it looked like she had you hostage.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.617
A hostage of love.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.287
Dang, she even called me negrito.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.708
You know, some people think
that negrito is a bad word, but...

18:04.792 --> 18:05.793
how do you feel about it?

18:06.502 --> 18:09.797
Yeah, well, the first time she said it,
I was about to call Reverend Al Sharpton,

18:10.047 --> 18:11.048
but...

18:12.132 --> 18:16.220
then Marisol explained what it means,
and now I'mma make it my Reddit username.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.182
Okay, I think that name
might already be taken.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.518
[sighs] So what do I do now?

18:22.601 --> 18:25.437
Well, you could try negrito1,
negrito2, negrito3--

18:25.521 --> 18:26.396
No, no, no.

18:27.481 --> 18:28.440
About Rita.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.819
Oh, well, if you like her so much,
why don't you let her know?

18:31.902 --> 18:33.904
Start liking her photos on Instagram,

18:33.987 --> 18:36.824
then slide into her DMs
with a selfie like this.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.537
Does that ever work?

18:41.620 --> 18:42.788
Once.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.666
Turned out you had to pay, though.

18:47.876 --> 18:51.213
Look, what do you usually do to let
a girl know that you're interested in her?

18:51.296 --> 18:53.173
I'm sure a smooth guy like you
has all the moves.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.633
It's all a front!

18:57.928 --> 19:00.347
I am a mess inside, brother.

19:01.765 --> 19:05.060
Do you have any idea how much pressure
there is on a young black man

19:05.144 --> 19:07.396
to act like he knows
how to handle the ladies?

19:08.063 --> 19:10.983
Michael B. Jordan has ruined it
for the rest of us.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.653
Mario Lopez did that for my people.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.825
-Just talk to her.
-How?

19:19.908 --> 19:22.202
On a prison phone
with that glass between us?

19:22.494 --> 19:24.163
We can't even touch fingers, man.

19:24.955 --> 19:25.998
You got her kicked out.

19:26.081 --> 19:29.042
Did I say "my bad" for that? Um...

19:29.126 --> 19:31.128
Okay, look. I'll work on the suspension,

19:31.211 --> 19:34.423
but if Rita were here right now,
what would you say to her?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.216
I got it. [clears throat]

19:36.300 --> 19:39.094
"I'm lining all my hoodies
with aluminum foil,

19:39.178 --> 19:40.804
I'll make one for you, boo."

19:42.973 --> 19:44.516
She's a girl, not a burrito.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.774
Hey, good to see you caught the bully.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.861
Lorenzo's actually the one being bullied.

19:55.944 --> 19:56.987
[Coach laughs]

19:57.362 --> 19:58.488
That's great.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.034
Who's the unsung hero
making a man out of him?

20:02.951 --> 20:03.869
Rita Perez.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.038
Jesus Christ, she's back in school?

20:10.417 --> 20:12.044
Look, I'm really sorry about that,
Lorenzo.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.129
Just pretend you didn't see any of that,
all right?

20:14.213 --> 20:18.675
Now Mr. Ochoa and I are gonna help you
figure out how to talk to a lady.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.136
I'll be Lorenzo,
Mr. Iglesias will be Rita.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.138
That's not how I pitched it,
but all right.

20:23.722 --> 20:24.556
[clears throat]

20:25.557 --> 20:26.725
What's up, stupid?

20:28.393 --> 20:30.187
Tell me you like my eyebrows.

20:31.271 --> 20:32.231
I'll cut you.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.942
Damn, you sound just like her.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.526
Now your turn, fool.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.613
Tell me what you like about me.
Better not be stupid.

20:40.697 --> 20:44.201
Girl, I love how big your feet look
in those Tims.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.706
No. Lorenzo, no.
Look, let me show you how it's done.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.583
[clears throat]

20:51.667 --> 20:53.335
All right, chaparrito,
show me what you got.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.212
-Hey.
-Ooh! That's firm.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.798
-All right, stop it.
-Yeah, do you work out?

20:57.881 --> 20:59.508
-¡Ay, Dios mío!
-Hey! Hey! Hey!

21:00.467 --> 21:02.803
Hey, we coulda switched sides, bro,
but you wanted to-- Okay.

21:02.886 --> 21:03.929
Look...

21:04.554 --> 21:06.014
just look deep into Rita's eyes.

21:07.474 --> 21:10.143
Speak slowly, so she knows it's important.

21:10.811 --> 21:12.604
But make sure whatever you say is a lie.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.733
Whenever you tell a woman the truth,
she will find a way to use it against you.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.486
¡Mentiroso!

21:22.489 --> 21:24.950
Lorenzo, what are you doing in here?

21:25.409 --> 21:27.536
Oh, are you hiding from Rita?

21:27.619 --> 21:30.080
I got your back.
What's her fighting style?

21:30.163 --> 21:32.291
Is she a grappler or a striker?

21:32.374 --> 21:33.500
She's a stabber.

21:37.671 --> 21:41.300
No, she's not. She's just a girl
who doesn't know how to talk to a boy

21:41.383 --> 21:43.635
-who doesn't know how to talk to a girl.
-Abby.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.512
Why don't you give him
a woman's perspective?

21:45.595 --> 21:47.764
Oh, sure. Lorenzo, it's simple.

21:47.848 --> 21:51.059
You want to be open but mysterious,
strong but vulnerable,

21:51.143 --> 21:54.730
big but not afraid to look small,
present but not clingy. Got it?

21:56.690 --> 21:58.817
I definitely do not.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.944
But I got why all three of you are single.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.323
Look...

22:04.489 --> 22:08.201
Rita's having her disciplinary hearing
today in Principal Madison's office.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.288
If you wanna help her out, you gotta tell
everybody what's really going on.

22:11.496 --> 22:14.499
[sighs] Man, not only do I have
to tell Rita how I feel,

22:14.583 --> 22:16.335
but I have to do it in front
of a room full of people?

22:16.418 --> 22:18.295
Yeah. Just speak from the heart.

22:18.378 --> 22:21.006
Look, if you open up to her,
I'm sure she'll open up to you.

22:21.089 --> 22:23.842
Or as Rita would say,
"Don't be stupid, stupid!"

22:28.430 --> 22:30.265
Miss Perez...

22:31.975 --> 22:33.268
[items clatter]

22:38.273 --> 22:40.400
...do you understand the charges
against you

22:40.817 --> 22:44.529
and your rights
in this disciplinary hearing?

22:45.906 --> 22:47.282
What, do you think I'm deaf?

22:47.366 --> 22:49.701
Like I can't hear you
through these monster hoops?

22:49.951 --> 22:51.328
Let's cut to the chase.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.413
I want to hear
what you have to say for yourself.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.833
[scoffs]
I ain't saying nothing without my lawyer.

22:56.917 --> 22:59.169
He's that guy whose face is
on the bus bench.

22:59.252 --> 23:03.256
His number is ocho-ocho-ocho,
ocho-ocho-ocho-ocho-ocho, ocho-ocho.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.929
I believe Lorenzo has something to say
that might clear things up.

23:09.846 --> 23:12.808
Why do you have to ruin everything?
You're worse than Mother!

23:20.273 --> 23:21.108
Lorenzo?

23:21.191 --> 23:22.025
[clears throat]

23:23.026 --> 23:24.403
Hey, girl. [chuckles]

23:25.779 --> 23:29.241
So, I was thinking, right,
about how things went down,

23:29.699 --> 23:31.701
what could have been,
and what still could be.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.036
You know what I'm saying?

23:33.578 --> 23:34.996
[giggles]

23:37.040 --> 23:38.166
You stupid.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.668
[laughs]

23:40.252 --> 23:41.628
Yeah, I agree with that.

23:43.338 --> 23:44.923
If you want to help your girl out,

23:45.006 --> 23:47.426
why don't you tell Rita
how you feel about her?

23:48.969 --> 23:52.097
[sighs]
Look, when you first started stalking me

23:52.180 --> 23:53.682
and blowing up my phone,

23:53.932 --> 23:56.685
I didn't really know what to do,
but I kinda liked it.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.771
And then when you were tackling me
and taking my money in the hall,

23:59.855 --> 24:03.567
I didn't really say anything,
'cause I didn't want you to stop.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.695
Wrap it up before they send you
to counseling.

24:06.778 --> 24:07.696
Okay.

24:09.072 --> 24:10.323
What I'm trying to say is,

24:10.407 --> 24:12.909
you don't have to try so hard
to get me to pay attention to you,

24:12.993 --> 24:14.035
because...

24:15.120 --> 24:16.538
I like you, Rita,

24:16.913 --> 24:18.623
and I'd like to get to know you better.

24:19.082 --> 24:20.041
Me too.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.586
Hey, you know what? Let's go
to a swap meet and get all freaky.

24:22.669 --> 24:24.504
Okay, my dad needs a new tarp.

24:24.588 --> 24:27.215
Hey. Hey.
Bring me back a bag of gasoline.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.133
Okay.

24:29.843 --> 24:30.886
A bag?

24:34.806 --> 24:38.643
So, Lorenzo, if you had been honest
with Rita in the beginning,

24:38.727 --> 24:40.061
none of this would have happened?

24:40.687 --> 24:41.730
Uh...

24:41.813 --> 24:43.023
-Yes, ma'am.
-Uh-huh.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.733
It's the man's fault, as usual.

24:46.943 --> 24:48.403
Men are so stupid, right?

24:48.487 --> 24:49.529
Mm-hmm.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.990
Rita, you can go back to class now.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.743
I think you're forgetting something.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.245
[whispers] What about the negrito?

24:59.372 --> 25:02.042
Uh,
I'm... I'm fine with her calling me that.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.754
Well, I don't like the word.
It makes me feel bad.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.380
You hear that, kids?

25:07.464 --> 25:09.382
I don't care what you call each other
in private,

25:09.466 --> 25:11.968
as long as you don't use words
that could hurt people's feelings.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.139
Now, I'm overdue to apologize to someone.

25:16.306 --> 25:20.685
-[clicks tongue] Aw, apology accepted.
-Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!

25:28.318 --> 25:31.613
Hey, Marisol.
Can I talk to you for a second?

25:32.113 --> 25:34.699
One Hispanic to another? Sure.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.409
I'm inclusive.

25:36.493 --> 25:37.994
Yeah, about that.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.456
So, look, I learned a new word today.

25:42.165 --> 25:45.418
Latin-X or Latinx.

25:46.002 --> 25:47.212
Maybe I learned two words.

25:48.296 --> 25:49.756
I'll take either one.

25:49.839 --> 25:52.300
I can see how the word Latino

25:52.384 --> 25:55.178
makes it seem like men are more important,

25:55.262 --> 25:58.515
and I can tell you,
as a son of a single mom, that's not true.

25:58.598 --> 26:01.309
I'm sorry for taking so long to catch on.

26:01.893 --> 26:02.894
Well, that's okay.

26:03.812 --> 26:07.190
Old people are slow, so... [chuckles]

26:08.191 --> 26:09.109
All right.

26:10.026 --> 26:13.822
Sometimes a teacher needs to get schooled,
and now I'm officially woke.

26:13.905 --> 26:16.408
By the way, I'm still okay with Latina.

26:16.491 --> 26:19.703
You and I together, we are Latinx.

26:19.786 --> 26:24.124
So, me by myself, I would be...?

26:24.207 --> 26:25.041
Mr. Iglesias?

26:25.125 --> 26:27.836
Yes! Yes! Let's use that.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.045
Yes. Thank you.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.589
[sighs] Oh, man.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.173
Oh, that's a lot to take in.

26:32.799 --> 26:33.883
What are you doing?

26:33.967 --> 26:37.596
I'm texting Tony. He still thinks Latinx
is a Mexican iPhone.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.768
[theme music playing]
