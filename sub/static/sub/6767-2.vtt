00:03.950 --> 00:05.577
Hello.

00:05.619 --> 00:06.916
Hey, Brandon.

00:06.953 --> 00:08.580
oh, my God,
the lonesome traveler.

00:08.622 --> 00:09.748
Hey. Welcome home.

00:09.790 --> 00:11.087
-Thank you, my man.
-Good to see you.

00:11.124 --> 00:12.250
-Good to be seen.
-Hey.

00:12.359 --> 00:13.656
-How are you, bro?
-How's the 'Stang?

00:13.693 --> 00:14.991
Those rednecks treat you okay?

00:15.028 --> 00:16.256
They ever find that water pump?

00:16.363 --> 00:17.830
Yeah, they did find
the water pump,

00:17.864 --> 00:19.491
and it's, uh, running just
fine. Thank you very much.

00:19.533 --> 00:22.764
Well, you should have done
what l did-- buy a new corvette.

00:22.803 --> 00:24.065
You bought a new 'Vette?

00:24.104 --> 00:25.366
-You know it.
-collectors edition?

00:25.405 --> 00:26.565
-Hello?
-Nice.

00:26.606 --> 00:27.800
clare, come on.

00:27.841 --> 00:29.433
l'm coming.
l'm coming.

00:29.476 --> 00:31.273
Dude, you know
what this weekend is?

00:31.311 --> 00:33.211
lt's reunion weekend
at the beach club.

00:33.246 --> 00:35.373
Better go dig that green
sweatshirt out of your closet.

00:35.415 --> 00:36.882
No, l don't...
l don't think so.

00:36.917 --> 00:39.249
l got a lot of road dust
to knock off myself.

00:39.286 --> 00:41.015
You might want to reconsider.

00:41.054 --> 00:43.249
This year's bikini stock
is pretty high.

00:43.290 --> 00:44.621
What's the matter, Brandon?

00:44.658 --> 00:46.626
You don't want to sit
in the boiling hot sun

00:46.660 --> 00:48.252
and listen to all the stories

00:48.295 --> 00:50.263
about the beach nymphs
Steve used to fantasize about?

00:50.297 --> 00:52.765
Well, that's quite an offer,
Mr. and Mrs. Bickerson,

00:52.799 --> 00:55.768
but l think l may pass, at
least for the time being.

00:55.802 --> 00:57.394
Well, look what
the wind blew in.

00:57.437 --> 00:58.563
-See ya, Val.
-Bye.

00:58.605 --> 01:00.129
-Have fun. Hi.
-Val.

01:00.173 --> 01:01.299
How are you?

01:01.341 --> 01:02.968
Have you been
holding down the fort?

01:03.009 --> 01:04.635
Yes, sir. l am proud to report

01:04.678 --> 01:07.374
that while you were out
on your scout, l was able

01:07.414 --> 01:09.848
to fend off a leaky toilet and
an air-conditioning breakdown.

01:09.883 --> 01:11.510
Hmm. Natives were restless?

01:11.551 --> 01:12.984
-Mm.
-Why are you all dressed up?

01:13.019 --> 01:14.486
l have a meeting with a cPA.

01:14.521 --> 01:15.647
Hoping to get a loan.

01:15.689 --> 01:16.917
oh, yeah. Right.

01:16.957 --> 01:18.481
Kenny Bannerman.
You know him?

01:18.525 --> 01:20.857
Bannerman. Kenny Bannerman.

01:20.894 --> 01:22.418
Yeah, yeah.

01:22.462 --> 01:24.453
He used to work
with my dad, right?

01:24.498 --> 01:26.523
Yeah, Dad said he was one
of the brightest young cPAs

01:26.566 --> 01:27.692
he ever worked with.

01:27.734 --> 01:29.429
Well, l hope so.
l need some extra cash,

01:29.469 --> 01:31.960
or the After Dark's not gonna
be able to turn on its lights.

01:32.005 --> 01:34.132
Well, they do call it
the After Dark.

01:34.174 --> 01:35.641
l'm sorry your summer

01:35.675 --> 01:36.699
didn't go so well.

01:36.743 --> 01:38.142
Yeah, me, too.

01:38.178 --> 01:39.440
l will see you later.

01:39.479 --> 01:40.605
Good luck.

01:40.647 --> 01:43.013
Thanks.

01:48.422 --> 01:51.687
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.

03:42.435 --> 03:44.596
Hey, you mind if l sit?

03:44.638 --> 03:46.162
of course not.

03:46.206 --> 03:48.140
Just 'cause we're not
working together anymore

03:48.174 --> 03:49.732
doesn't mean you have to ask.

03:50.944 --> 03:52.070
Thanks.

03:52.112 --> 03:53.477
Yeah.

03:53.513 --> 03:56.277
David, do you remember that
one time when we were kids,

03:56.383 --> 03:57.645
and you went swimming,

03:57.684 --> 04:00.016
and that big wave came and
pulled your trunks off?

04:00.053 --> 04:01.520
And you wouldn't get
out of the ocean?

04:01.555 --> 04:02.852
And your little head
just kept bobbing

04:02.889 --> 04:04.186
up and down in
the surf all day?

04:04.224 --> 04:05.521
Yeah, yeah, yeah, very funny.

04:05.559 --> 04:06.753
oh, come on. lt
was hysterical.

04:06.793 --> 04:08.784
And your dad had to
bribe you with a trip

04:08.828 --> 04:10.420
to Toys R Us to get
you to come out.

04:10.463 --> 04:11.691
okay, l remember.

04:11.731 --> 04:13.096
Now can we please forget?

04:15.435 --> 04:18.495
oh, my God, there's
casey Watkins.

04:18.538 --> 04:20.665
l used to have
the biggest crush on him.

04:20.707 --> 04:21.673
lt was awful.

04:21.708 --> 04:23.141
He would never even look at me.

04:23.176 --> 04:24.643
But Donna, the guy was a jerk.

04:24.678 --> 04:26.236
oh, l was so in love with him.

04:26.346 --> 04:28.814
You know, once l don't think
l ate for, like, a week.

04:28.848 --> 04:30.338
Well, you know what?
lf you're so in love,

04:30.383 --> 04:31.509
why don't you just go over there

04:31.551 --> 04:32.677
and help him
with his potato salad?

04:32.719 --> 04:34.243
oh, please!

04:34.354 --> 04:37.187
can't we just enjoy ourselves
for a change?

04:37.223 --> 04:39.157
How can you be so insensitive?

04:39.192 --> 04:40.716
l've been waiting
for this pickup

04:40.760 --> 04:42.022
from MZA for a week,

04:42.062 --> 04:44.121
and you're acting
like it's no big deal.

04:44.164 --> 04:47.258
lf MZA drops my contract,
my video career is through.

04:47.367 --> 04:49.358
David,
you have no control over it.

04:49.402 --> 04:52.894
And l... l'm sick and tired
of talking about it, okay?

04:52.939 --> 04:54.270
Yeah, it's easy for you to say.

04:54.341 --> 04:56.002
You're the one who bailed out
on the deal, remember?

04:56.042 --> 04:58.169
Listen, David, if you don't want
to enjoy yourself today,

04:58.211 --> 04:59.269
that's fine with me.

04:59.379 --> 05:00.903
You can just sit here and mope.

05:00.947 --> 05:01.845
Yeah, maybe l will.

05:01.881 --> 05:03.212
Good.

05:03.249 --> 05:05.217
l think l'm going
to have some potato salad.

05:05.251 --> 05:08.277
oh, and if l see casey,
l'll say hello for you.

05:12.859 --> 05:14.827
Ryan, Ryan,
she's checking you out again.

05:14.861 --> 05:18.695
Man, l'd give my eyes
for one look at those beauties.

05:18.732 --> 05:20.029
oh, no. Just...

05:20.066 --> 05:21.226
just give up one eye.

05:21.301 --> 05:23.235
Save one for
the other chicks.

05:23.303 --> 05:25.066
oh. Nice advice.

05:25.105 --> 05:26.732
lt's a voice of experience.

05:26.773 --> 05:29.241
Besides, Austin, in case
you hadn't noticed,

05:29.309 --> 05:31.539
she got the hots
for your brother.

05:31.578 --> 05:33.705
-You really think so, Steve?
-oh, come on.

05:33.747 --> 05:34.941
You ever heard of a sure thing?

05:34.981 --> 05:35.845
Yeah.

05:35.882 --> 05:38.578
You're looking at one.

05:38.618 --> 05:40.779
lf l ever had a chance
with Beth Rawlings,

05:40.820 --> 05:43.015
l'd either faint or die.

05:43.056 --> 05:44.717
come on, bro.

05:44.758 --> 05:45.850
We got work to do.

05:45.892 --> 05:47.257
Hmm? oh.

05:47.293 --> 05:48.783
Brows.

05:48.828 --> 05:52.127
He's...

05:52.165 --> 05:53.598
chips off the old block.

05:53.633 --> 05:55.601
Yeah, Darwin would be delighted.

05:55.635 --> 05:56.863
Another victory for genetics.

05:56.903 --> 05:58.200
Hi, guys.

05:58.238 --> 05:59.364
-Hey, Kel.
-Hey.

05:59.406 --> 06:00.600
Do you want iced cappuccino?

06:00.640 --> 06:01.834
-Yeah, l'd love some.
-ooh.

06:01.875 --> 06:03.035
-You want one?
-Yeah, sure.

06:03.076 --> 06:04.202
-okay.
-Thanks.

06:04.310 --> 06:05.743
No problem.

06:05.779 --> 06:07.041
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.412
Another year, another
beach club reunion, huh?

06:09.449 --> 06:11.212
You've always had
such a special knack

06:11.317 --> 06:12.750
for overstating the obvious.

06:12.786 --> 06:15.118
You remember the good old days
when we were in high school?

06:15.155 --> 06:16.884
We used to have so much fun
every summer.

06:16.923 --> 06:21.053
Yup, l remember, but
l'm still having fun.

06:21.094 --> 06:23.494
You know, l remember
a certain summer in particular

06:23.530 --> 06:25.498
that was very memorable.

06:25.532 --> 06:27.659
-l bet you do.
-oh,

06:27.701 --> 06:31.000
l think you know exactly what
l'm talking about, don't you?

06:31.037 --> 06:32.937
Yes, all l had
to do was consider the source.

06:32.972 --> 06:35.668
Hmm. Well, let's see
if my memory serves me.

06:35.709 --> 06:39.475
lt's about 20 feet from where
we're sitting right now, right?

06:39.512 --> 06:42.913
The grunion were running,
it was a full moon,

06:42.949 --> 06:45.179
and that night,
l was lucky enough

06:45.218 --> 06:47.118
to have Kelly Taylor
in my arms.

06:47.153 --> 06:49.587
Mm. You have
a good memory.

06:51.591 --> 06:53.115
Some things are unforgettable.

06:55.028 --> 06:56.996
lt was unforgettable,
wasn't it?

06:57.030 --> 06:58.520
What?

06:58.565 --> 06:59.964
What?!

06:59.999 --> 07:01.967
You're such a pig.

07:02.001 --> 07:03.434
l know l'm a pig,
but other than that,

07:03.470 --> 07:05.097
it was unforgettable
wasn't it?

07:05.138 --> 07:07.129
All right, it was unforgettable.
Are you happy now?

07:07.173 --> 07:08.504
Yeah, l'm happy,

07:08.541 --> 07:10.634
but l didn't mean
to upset you. Gosh.

07:10.677 --> 07:12.645
You didn't upset me.

07:12.679 --> 07:14.203
l got to go.

07:14.247 --> 07:16.010
Tell clare l said good-bye.

07:20.153 --> 07:21.620
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.

07:21.654 --> 07:23.622
l remember the night
of the spring dance.

07:23.656 --> 07:25.385
Heck, l remember
when we broke up.

07:25.425 --> 07:27.120
You're generally one
of the most thoughtless

07:27.160 --> 07:28.627
and spoiled people
l've ever known.

07:28.661 --> 07:29.787
Well, surprise.

07:29.829 --> 07:31.626
We have a lot in common.

07:31.664 --> 07:35.031
You're the only one l know
who's as defective as l am.

07:35.068 --> 07:37.036
l am not defective, Steve.

07:37.070 --> 07:38.628
oh, yeah?

07:38.671 --> 07:40.400
Your mom spends half her life

07:40.440 --> 07:42.374
in detox, the other half
of her life unconscious.

07:42.408 --> 07:43.875
Shut up!

07:43.910 --> 07:46.572
And l've never even met the man
who you claim is your father.

07:46.613 --> 07:48.478
Although l suppose
it doesn't matter too much

07:48.515 --> 07:50.847
as long as the checks
keep coming in on time.

07:50.884 --> 07:53.512
Why are you trying
to ruin my night?

07:55.421 --> 07:57.821
l'm not trying
to ruin your night.

08:03.730 --> 08:05.630
l just get so angry

08:05.665 --> 08:08.327
when all you had
to do was say one word,

08:08.368 --> 08:11.531
just one word to let me know
you cared about me.

08:13.239 --> 08:15.139
l do care about you, Steve.

08:15.175 --> 08:16.301
l said l'm sorry.

08:16.342 --> 08:18.242
l don't know
what else l can do.

08:19.279 --> 08:21.975
l don't know.

08:23.016 --> 08:26.645
l'm sorry, too.

08:28.855 --> 08:31.483
l don't know
why l said these things.

08:31.524 --> 08:35.392
'cause deep inside,
you're just a jerk, that's why.

08:46.573 --> 08:48.905
Here's your drink.

08:48.942 --> 08:50.910
Hello.

08:50.944 --> 08:52.639
Here's your drink.

08:52.679 --> 08:53.873
No, thanks.

08:53.913 --> 08:55.972
You sent me to
get iced cappuccino,

08:56.015 --> 08:57.539
and now you don't want any?

08:57.584 --> 08:59.575
Thanks. Where's Kel?

09:01.020 --> 09:02.180
She had to go.

09:02.288 --> 09:03.585
Why? What happened?

09:03.623 --> 09:05.022
Nothing.

09:05.058 --> 09:07.492
These stupid
beach club reunions.

09:07.527 --> 09:09.961
once in a while, they bring up
bad memories, that's all.

09:09.996 --> 09:11.122
Your dad?

09:11.164 --> 09:15.191
No. No, actually,
it's, uh, Kelly.

09:15.268 --> 09:16.633
Kelly? What about Kelly?

09:18.004 --> 09:19.164
oh, it was nothing.

09:19.205 --> 09:20.729
lt happened a long time ago.

09:20.773 --> 09:21.933
Forget it.

09:21.975 --> 09:24.068
Well, you started it,
so finish it.

09:25.879 --> 09:28.040
Something happened between us,
that's all.

09:28.081 --> 09:29.810
lt's... nothing really.

09:29.849 --> 09:31.441
l shouldn't have brought it up.

09:31.484 --> 09:34.578
lt was after we slept together.

09:34.621 --> 09:36.646
What? You slept with Kelly?

09:36.689 --> 09:39.157
Yeah. When we were
in high school. You knew that.

09:39.192 --> 09:40.921
-No, l didn't know that.
-clare, come on.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.655
Everybody knows
Kelly and l slept together.

09:42.695 --> 09:44.526
Well, l guess l missed that.

09:44.564 --> 09:46.998
oh, honey, l'm sorry.
l thought you knew.

09:47.033 --> 09:48.796
Well, l didn't, okay? And l kind
of wish you hadn't have told me,

09:48.835 --> 09:50.769
'cause now
you've ruined my whole weekend.

09:50.803 --> 09:51.792
-clare...
-l don't even want

09:51.838 --> 09:53.305
to talk to you anymore
about it, okay?

10:03.182 --> 10:04.877
Ms. Malone,
nice to see you again.

10:04.918 --> 10:06.044
Same here.

10:06.085 --> 10:07.450
-Take a seat.
-Thanks.

10:07.487 --> 10:10.581
Well, l spoke to Jim Walsh
since last we saw each other,

10:10.623 --> 10:12.955
and he told me that
you were practically family,

10:12.992 --> 10:15.256
and that l should
bend over backwards for you.

10:15.361 --> 10:17.261
Well, don't strain yourself.

10:17.297 --> 10:18.730
So, what'd you have in mind?

10:18.765 --> 10:19.732
Do you play tennis?

10:19.766 --> 10:21.734
A little.

10:21.768 --> 10:23.565
Excellent. l've got
a court at 1 1 :00,

10:23.603 --> 10:24.968
a partner with a sprained ankle.

10:25.004 --> 10:26.130
What do you say?

10:26.172 --> 10:27.537
Well, l thought l was coming by

10:27.573 --> 10:28.699
to get some sound
business advice,

10:28.741 --> 10:30.072
and now
you need a tennis partner?

10:30.109 --> 10:33.135
Valerie, are you more
than 30 days in arrears

10:33.179 --> 10:34.476
to any of your creditors?

10:34.514 --> 10:35.640
No, not yet.

10:35.682 --> 10:36.808
Good.

10:36.849 --> 10:38.373
Then we'll get in a couple
of sets,

10:38.418 --> 10:39.544
and we'll solve
your financial crisis

10:39.585 --> 10:40.711
over some vegetable juice.

10:40.753 --> 10:42.243
Sounds like
l don't have a choice.

10:42.288 --> 10:44.222
Ah, you catch on quick,
you know that?

10:44.257 --> 10:46.691
come on. Let's go.

10:51.197 --> 10:52.858
-Hey, Kel.
-Hi, David. Hi, Mark.

10:52.899 --> 10:54.161
-How you doing?
-Good.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.100
Hey, you're not taking off
already, are you?

10:56.135 --> 10:58.535
Yeah, l start my work at
the AlDS hospice today.

10:58.571 --> 10:59.970
l have to be there by 1 :00.

11:00.006 --> 11:01.769
So do you have any idea
when Brandon's coming back?

11:01.808 --> 11:04.003
Uh, Steve said
he got back this morning. Why?

11:04.043 --> 11:05.442
Well, l've got some big plans
for him

11:05.478 --> 11:06.706
at the campus TV station
this year.

11:06.746 --> 11:07.872
Yeah, Mark's

11:07.914 --> 11:09.108
the new, uh, program director.

11:09.148 --> 11:10.843
l really want to get Brandon

11:10.883 --> 11:11.872
on board here, okay?

11:11.918 --> 11:13.010
So if you guys can help me out,

11:13.052 --> 11:14.041
l'd really appreciate it.

11:14.087 --> 11:15.577
What do you say?

11:15.621 --> 11:16.815
l don't know about that.

11:16.856 --> 11:18.790
Brandon's always had a mind
of his own.

11:20.059 --> 11:21.890
Good luck. See you.

11:24.364 --> 11:27.060
Hey, come on, that's my sister
you're looking at.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.863
Yeah, l just hope
she looks back.

11:48.554 --> 11:49.919
All right.

11:49.956 --> 11:52.390
Now, l can keep staring at you
until l embarrass myself,

11:52.425 --> 11:54.655
or you can just tell me
how we know each other.

11:54.694 --> 11:56.457
okay. l'll, um...
l'll give you a hint.

11:56.496 --> 11:57.656
lt's from the beach club.

11:57.697 --> 11:59.665
Yeah, well, that much
l already figured out.

11:59.699 --> 12:01.064
come on, give me
something else.

12:01.100 --> 12:04.467
okay, um, the summer
between ninth and tenth grade.

12:04.504 --> 12:06.165
Let's see... ninth
and tenth grade.

12:06.205 --> 12:07.672
Did your parents
have a cabana here?

12:07.707 --> 12:09.231
You're getting warmer.

12:09.275 --> 12:11.004
oh, my God.

12:11.044 --> 12:13.342
You were the girl
in the cabana next to ours.

12:13.379 --> 12:15.074
Your father's
a doctor, right?

12:15.114 --> 12:16.672
That's right-- Dr. Martin.

12:16.716 --> 12:18.775
-l'm Donna Martin.
-That's right. Yeah.

12:18.818 --> 12:19.842
Now l remember.

12:19.886 --> 12:21.979
Wow, you, uh...
you sure have changed.

12:22.021 --> 12:23.113
Well, so have you.

12:23.156 --> 12:24.555
You wouldn't even talk
to me back then.

12:24.590 --> 12:25.579
Well, let's, uh,

12:25.625 --> 12:27.616
chalk one up
for the passage of time.

12:27.660 --> 12:29.491
Hey, are you gonna be
at that dance tonight?

12:29.529 --> 12:30.689
Yeah. Are you?

12:30.730 --> 12:31.856
-l sure am.
-Good.

12:31.898 --> 12:33.456
We'll see each other, then?

12:33.499 --> 12:34.761
count on it.

12:34.801 --> 12:36.029
-okay.
-Good-bye.

12:36.069 --> 12:37.559
Bye.

12:53.019 --> 12:54.247
Well, that was
a good workout.

12:54.287 --> 12:55.777
Yeah.

12:55.822 --> 12:57.016
You know, with a
little practice,

12:57.056 --> 12:58.455
you could learn to
control that topspin.

12:58.491 --> 12:59.583
oh, l'm hopeless.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.217
-Are you kidding?
-Aah.

13:01.260 --> 13:02.522
Where did you learn
to play so good?

13:02.562 --> 13:05.690
My wife, she was the star of her
college tennis team.

13:05.731 --> 13:06.789
You're married?

13:06.833 --> 13:07.959
l was.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.058
Well, l am, technically.

13:09.102 --> 13:10.069
We're separated.

13:10.103 --> 13:11.661
-l'm sorry.
-Uh-uh.

13:11.704 --> 13:13.569
Don't be.
lt's been a long time coming.

13:13.606 --> 13:15.233
Well, you've indulged me.

13:15.341 --> 13:17.536
Now it's your turn.

13:17.577 --> 13:19.602
Whew. l think l can get you
the money you need

13:19.645 --> 13:21.078
to revitalize your business.

13:21.114 --> 13:22.240
-Really?
-Yeah.

13:22.348 --> 13:23.747
l prepared several
loan applications

13:23.783 --> 13:26.251
plus an SBA application,
and l'm pretty certain

13:26.285 --> 13:27.752
one of them
will come through, so...

13:27.787 --> 13:29.254
So, what do l
have to do?

13:29.322 --> 13:31.347
Well, just sign
the paperwork and we wait.

13:31.390 --> 13:32.448
Well, how long?

13:32.492 --> 13:34.050
My cash is not gonna
hold out forever.

13:34.093 --> 13:35.958
Well, an okay on the bank loan
will be short-term,

13:35.995 --> 13:37.929
but the, uh, SBA
will take a little bit longer.

13:37.964 --> 13:39.261
But don't you worry.

13:39.332 --> 13:40.594
We'll get you through.

13:40.633 --> 13:42.498
So, when do l
sign the papers?

13:42.535 --> 13:44.696
Um, tonight
at an early dinner.

13:44.737 --> 13:46.261
You've got this all
figured out, don't you?

13:46.372 --> 13:48.397
That's my job.

14:18.137 --> 14:19.695
Excuse me?

14:19.739 --> 14:20.728
May l help you?

14:20.773 --> 14:21.899
Hi. Yeah.

14:21.941 --> 14:23.533
Um, a friend of mine
is volunteering here,

14:23.576 --> 14:26.204

14:32.351 --> 14:33.375
of the AlDS Hospice.

14:33.419 --> 14:34.613
-Hi.
-Uh, you will find

14:34.654 --> 14:36.554
Kelly somewhere back
there cleaning up.

14:36.589 --> 14:38.079
Thanks.

14:38.124 --> 14:39.318
You're welcome.

14:58.678 --> 15:01.146
Kelly.

15:01.180 --> 15:02.613
Brandon?

15:02.648 --> 15:04.809
What are you doing here?

15:04.850 --> 15:07.614
Actually, l, uh,
came by to see you.

15:09.088 --> 15:10.521
Bet you never thought
you'd find me

15:10.556 --> 15:11.921
doing something like this.

15:11.958 --> 15:13.585
To tell you the truth, uh...

15:13.626 --> 15:15.491
lt's part of my psych
work this summer.

15:15.528 --> 15:17.223
lt's something
l really wanted to do.

15:17.296 --> 15:18.695
For me, you know?

15:18.731 --> 15:20.323
l understand.

15:20.366 --> 15:21.697
lt's good for the soul.

15:21.734 --> 15:23.827
Yeah.

15:25.404 --> 15:27.634
When did you get back?

15:27.673 --> 15:28.833
couple hours ago.

15:28.874 --> 15:30.102
Yeah?

15:30.142 --> 15:32.110
So, are you headed over
to the beach club?

15:32.144 --> 15:33.736
Yeah. Yeah.

15:33.779 --> 15:35.940
l just wanted to see you first.

15:35.982 --> 15:37.677
Well, l'm glad you did.

15:38.651 --> 15:40.551
As soon as l'm finished up here,

15:40.586 --> 15:41.951
l'll meet you over there.

15:41.988 --> 15:43.250
okay.

15:43.322 --> 15:44.482
You'll recognize me.

15:44.523 --> 15:46.184
l'm the one with the farmer tan.

15:47.226 --> 15:48.523
okay.

15:49.762 --> 15:51.457
l'm glad you're home.

15:51.497 --> 15:52.486
l missed you.

15:52.531 --> 15:54.362
Yeah, l missed you, too.

15:56.102 --> 15:57.330
See you later.

16:18.124 --> 16:19.216
clare...

16:19.292 --> 16:20.953
where's your better half?

16:20.993 --> 16:22.585
Back there playing poker.

16:24.597 --> 16:27.828
Did you know that, uh, Steve
and Kelly slept together?

16:27.867 --> 16:29.562
Yeah, sure. Why?

16:29.602 --> 16:30.864
Great.

16:30.903 --> 16:33.497
So, everybody does
know, then, right?

16:33.539 --> 16:35.006
What are you talking about?

16:35.041 --> 16:37.134
Everybody but me.

16:37.176 --> 16:39.667
clare, it was
a long time ago.

16:39.712 --> 16:41.236
We were in high school.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.872
What's the big deal?

16:42.915 --> 16:46.681
Has it ever occurred to you how
incestuous this little group is?

16:46.719 --> 16:49.210
l try not to dwell on it.

16:49.255 --> 16:52.588
Do you think that Steve might
still have feelings for her?

16:52.625 --> 16:53.683
-l mean...
-No.

16:53.726 --> 16:55.216
No-no, absolutely not.

16:55.261 --> 16:56.228
Brandon,

16:56.262 --> 16:57.388
please.

17:01.701 --> 17:03.032
clare...

17:03.069 --> 17:04.798
you know how Steve
feels about you.

17:04.837 --> 17:06.031
Maybe, but,

17:06.071 --> 17:08.165
um... it's human nature,

17:08.207 --> 17:11.108
and Steve's about as human
as you can get.

17:20.319 --> 17:21.945
Steve, l want to talk to you.

17:21.987 --> 17:23.113
Uh, honey, right now,

17:23.155 --> 17:24.747
l'm in the middle
of a winning hand.

17:24.790 --> 17:26.189
Like l care.

17:26.224 --> 17:27.624
Talk to me now
or this is gonna be

17:27.660 --> 17:29.127
the longest poker game
of your life.

17:29.161 --> 17:30.185
Hey, Sanders,

17:30.229 --> 17:31.196
you'd better fold

17:31.230 --> 17:32.390
before you get folded.

17:32.431 --> 17:33.864
oh, you'd love that,
wouldn't you?

17:33.899 --> 17:35.560
Steve, l'm serious, okay?

17:38.304 --> 17:40.295
l was bluffing anyway.

17:43.275 --> 17:46.403
What's the matter?
What's so important?

17:46.445 --> 17:48.413
l want to get out of here,
okay? Take me home.

17:48.447 --> 17:50.244
Now? come on, it's the middle
of the afternoon.

17:50.316 --> 17:52.443
l thought you were looking
forward to a day at the beach.

17:52.485 --> 17:54.749
l was, but l'm
not anymore, okay?

17:54.787 --> 17:57.449
clare, come on, just try
and relax and have a good time.

17:57.490 --> 17:59.048
No! l want to know what happened
between you and Kelly.

17:59.091 --> 18:01.321
l told you we did it once
and that was it.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.486
What more do you want to know?

18:02.528 --> 18:03.995
Well, why does it bother you?

18:04.029 --> 18:05.826
l mean, why are you
still bringing it up?

18:05.865 --> 18:07.890
Because it happened here,
that's all.

18:07.933 --> 18:09.195
l just remembered that.

18:09.268 --> 18:10.326
Well, how did things end?

18:10.369 --> 18:11.563
l mean, why was it
just that one night?

18:11.604 --> 18:12.798
You know what?

18:12.838 --> 18:14.601
l really don't want
to talk about this.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.608
-Well, guess what, l do.
-Give me a break, clare.

18:16.642 --> 18:17.802
lt's nothing that l'm proud of.

18:17.843 --> 18:19.333
can't you just leave it at that?

18:19.378 --> 18:21.608
-l knew it was something.
-lt was nothing.

18:21.647 --> 18:23.114
Now, give it a rest.

18:23.149 --> 18:24.207
-No.
-No?

18:24.316 --> 18:25.647
okay, then, you know what?

18:25.684 --> 18:26.673
You're on your own.

18:26.719 --> 18:29.313
l'm gonna go back
and play cards.

18:35.528 --> 18:37.860
Your flowers are beautiful.

18:37.897 --> 18:39.091
Well, this place
sure has changed

18:39.131 --> 18:41.224
since the last time l was here.

18:41.267 --> 18:43.235
oh, really,
when was that?

18:43.269 --> 18:45.237
Back a few years ago
when l joined the firm,

18:45.337 --> 18:47.168
Jim and cindy had
my wife and l--

18:47.206 --> 18:51.404
my ex-wife and l
over for, uh, dinner.

18:51.444 --> 18:53.571
You don't seem sure of that.

18:53.612 --> 18:55.375
ls she your wife or ex-wife?

18:55.414 --> 18:57.814
lt is a marriage in name only.

18:57.850 --> 19:00.341
As a matter of fact,
she's on Martha's Vineyard

19:00.386 --> 19:01.683
right now for the summer.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.813
And when she gets back,
we're going to finalize things.

19:05.524 --> 19:07.992
-Any kids?
-Yeah.

19:08.027 --> 19:09.892
l have a son, six.

19:09.929 --> 19:11.191
That's great.

19:11.263 --> 19:12.457
Must be hard, though.

19:12.498 --> 19:14.329
Hasn't been easy.

19:14.366 --> 19:15.799
-on any of us.
-So what would

19:15.835 --> 19:17.632
your wife think about us
going out to dinner?

19:17.670 --> 19:19.194
She couldn't care less.

19:19.238 --> 19:22.071
She does her thing, l do mine.

19:23.209 --> 19:25.177
So how's Brandon
and, uh, Brenda doing?

19:25.211 --> 19:26.508
Well, Brenda's been in London

19:26.545 --> 19:28.206
for the last few years,
and Brandon's probably down

19:28.314 --> 19:29.838
at the beach club
with his friends.

19:29.882 --> 19:32.009
-Beverly Hills Beach club?
-Yeah.

19:32.051 --> 19:33.382
l go there all the time.

19:33.419 --> 19:34.545
You're a member?

19:34.587 --> 19:35.554
l've been for years.

19:35.588 --> 19:37.351
Well, uh,
are we in a hurry,

19:37.389 --> 19:38.686
or can l fix you a drink?

19:38.724 --> 19:39.884
No hurry.

19:39.925 --> 19:41.392
okay.

19:41.427 --> 19:44.658
oh, you may not want to leave
this joint lying around.

19:46.899 --> 19:48.526
Uh, l'm sorry.

19:48.567 --> 19:50.364
l hope this doesn't
offend you.

19:50.402 --> 19:51.767
oh, what, are you kidding me?

19:51.804 --> 19:54.102
-You never know.
-Well, that's true.

19:54.139 --> 19:56.198
''Err on the side of caution,''
l always say.

19:56.242 --> 19:57.709
Yeah.

19:57.743 --> 19:59.734
Well, l'll get you a drink.
Uh, scotch okay?

19:59.778 --> 20:01.769
That's fine.

20:22.601 --> 20:24.865
-Here you go.
-Thanks!

20:26.272 --> 20:28.433
So my mom says l don't
have a curfew tonight.

20:28.474 --> 20:30.840
-What about you?
-Nah, we never have curfews.

20:30.876 --> 20:32.537
our dad trusts us.

20:32.578 --> 20:34.136
Wow, you're lucky, Ryan.

20:34.179 --> 20:36.409
Usually my mother
watches me like a hawk.

20:36.448 --> 20:37.415
But not tonight.

20:37.449 --> 20:38.780
l like the sound of that.

20:38.817 --> 20:40.375
Me, too.

20:42.621 --> 20:44.248
So maybe we could take
a walk later.

20:44.290 --> 20:45.814
Sounds great.

20:45.858 --> 20:48.053
Well, l'm getting
a little chilly.

20:48.093 --> 20:49.890
l'm going to go change.

20:49.929 --> 20:51.055
Do you want to meet me
here later?

20:51.096 --> 20:52.393
count on it.

20:57.636 --> 20:58.967
-How'd it go?
-Great!

20:59.004 --> 21:00.733
She wants to take
a walk with me later.

21:00.773 --> 21:01.899
Where'd she go?

21:01.941 --> 21:03.806
She said she had
to go change.

21:03.842 --> 21:05.434
Really? Great, perfect.

21:05.477 --> 21:06.876
What?

21:06.912 --> 21:08.709
Follow me.
Got an idea.

21:08.747 --> 21:10.442
oh, great.

21:10.482 --> 21:12.882
Look, Mark, l don't know
anything about television.

21:12.918 --> 21:14.112
l've been waiting
for my shot

21:14.153 --> 21:15.245
to be editor
of The Condor,

21:15.321 --> 21:16.652
Yeah, but you're
intrigued, right?

21:16.689 --> 21:18.384
Well, the idea
of being the news director

21:18.424 --> 21:21.052
of the campus TV station
does have some appeal, yes.

21:21.093 --> 21:22.754
-A couple beers, man.
-Good. Good.

21:22.795 --> 21:24.854
Look, l don't expect you to make
up your mind right here, okay?

21:24.897 --> 21:26.262
Just wait until you see
the investment

21:26.298 --> 21:27.595
the university's
putting into this

21:27.633 --> 21:29.692
-new operation, all right?
-All right. l'll wait.

21:29.735 --> 21:31.032
Maybe you can convince me.

21:31.070 --> 21:32.833
l will convince you.

21:32.871 --> 21:34.099
Mm-hmm.

21:34.139 --> 21:35.766
Hey, guys.
What'd l miss?

21:35.808 --> 21:37.969
Just this maniac twisting
my arm for the last

21:38.010 --> 21:39.534
half hour
about giving up my

21:39.578 --> 21:41.705
journalistic integrity
for the idiot box.

21:41.747 --> 21:43.271
Brandon, you know
as well as l do that

21:43.315 --> 21:44.942
nobody reads newspaper anymore.

21:44.984 --> 21:46.815
All right, let's get shaking!

21:49.822 --> 21:51.551
So, Kelly...

21:51.590 --> 21:52.852
how about a dance?

21:52.891 --> 21:54.188
Sure.

21:54.226 --> 21:56.023
You don't mind, do you,
Brandon?

21:56.061 --> 21:57.722
No, no, no, l wouldn't dance
with you anyway.

21:57.763 --> 21:59.526
lt'd be too confusing.
Who would lead?

22:06.438 --> 22:08.599
l can't believe l let
you talk me into this.

22:08.641 --> 22:09.869
Just be quiet.

22:09.908 --> 22:12.502
You're about to have
a peek at paradise.

22:12.544 --> 22:14.739
Honey, is that you?!

22:14.780 --> 22:16.577
Yeah, Mom!
Do you want the shower?

22:16.615 --> 22:18.640
No, l'm just going
to change into a sweater.

22:18.684 --> 22:20.174
You make sure you
put something warm on.

22:20.219 --> 22:21.982
lt's chilly out there.

22:22.021 --> 22:23.886
-l will, Mom.
-Don't look

22:23.922 --> 22:25.253
or you'll turn to stone.

22:25.357 --> 22:27.257
Why did l listen to you?

22:27.326 --> 22:29.692
l...

22:29.728 --> 22:31.252
Thanks for the dance.

22:31.363 --> 22:33.263
Well, that was
just the first one.

22:33.298 --> 22:35.061
Let me get you something
to drink.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.261
-okay.
-Don't you go anywhere.

22:37.369 --> 22:38.597
l'll be right back.

22:38.637 --> 22:40.628
l won't.

22:46.545 --> 22:48.479
Well...

22:48.514 --> 22:51.915
you two are looking
really, uh... cozy.

22:51.950 --> 22:53.281
David, please.

22:53.352 --> 22:54.410
Let it go.

22:54.453 --> 22:56.751
No, l'm not going to let it go.

22:56.789 --> 22:58.051
What's going on here?

22:58.090 --> 23:00.422
l'm having a good time.

23:00.459 --> 23:01.949
That's what's ''going on.''

23:01.994 --> 23:03.962
-Would you like to dance?
-No, Donna.

23:03.996 --> 23:06.464
l'm really not in the mood
to dance right now. You know,

23:06.498 --> 23:09.092
it was one thing when you wanted
out of our business partnership,

23:09.134 --> 23:11.193
but now, now l realize
you just wanted

23:11.236 --> 23:12.601
to start dating other guys.

23:12.638 --> 23:15.232
l'm not dating him, David,
l'm dancing with him.

23:15.307 --> 23:17.138
And if you weren't in
such a perpetual bad mood,

23:17.176 --> 23:18.473
we'd be having a good time.

23:18.510 --> 23:20.034
oh, yeah, it's always
my fault, right?

23:20.079 --> 23:21.706
Maybe if you'd open your eyes,
you'd realize l'm having

23:21.747 --> 23:23.647
a lousy time, and you're not
making it any easier.

23:23.682 --> 23:25.206
l'm sorry, but l've tried.

23:25.250 --> 23:27.218
You don't want to listen
to anything that l have to say.

23:27.252 --> 23:28.219
You know what?

23:28.253 --> 23:29.345
l've had it with you.

23:29.388 --> 23:30.821
At least now l know
who l can count on.

23:30.856 --> 23:31.914
No, wait.

23:31.957 --> 23:34.255
ls that really
the way that you feel?

23:34.326 --> 23:36.419
-Yeah, it is.
-Then l'm sorry.

23:36.462 --> 23:38.054
'cause you can count on me.

23:38.097 --> 23:39.758
You just don't want to see that,
'cause you're so angry

23:39.798 --> 23:41.129
that l don't want
to be your partner anymore.

23:41.166 --> 23:43.100
You just know everything,
don't you?

23:50.209 --> 23:52.837
You two have
a real nice evening.

24:05.457 --> 24:08.221
lt was the most
incredible meeting

24:08.293 --> 24:09.920
with anyone l've ever had.

24:09.962 --> 24:11.122
Right then and there
in the middle

24:11.163 --> 24:12.357
of this small town,
in the middle

24:12.397 --> 24:14.092
of nowhere Texas,

24:14.133 --> 24:17.534
this girl decides
to entirely change her life.

24:17.569 --> 24:18.831
lt was unbelievable.

24:18.871 --> 24:20.771
Well, l'm sure you had
something to do with it.

24:20.806 --> 24:22.865
l don't know about that.

24:22.908 --> 24:24.239
l think it was
just luck and timing.

24:24.309 --> 24:26.937
l don't know, Brandon,

24:26.979 --> 24:29.345
you've changed
a lot of people's lives.

24:29.381 --> 24:30.746
Mine included.

24:30.783 --> 24:32.808
Yea, l thinketh not,
young maiden.

24:32.851 --> 24:34.512
You're doing just fine
all by yourself.

24:34.553 --> 24:36.077
Thanks.

24:36.121 --> 24:39.056
l'm really trying to get
my life together.

24:39.091 --> 24:40.524
l want to be happy, you know?

24:40.559 --> 24:42.424
Well, that's not too much
to ask.

24:42.461 --> 24:44.622
Now you are mocking me.

24:44.663 --> 24:46.096
No, no, no,
l'm not mocking you,

24:46.131 --> 24:48.065
but you got to tell me
what's going on?

24:48.100 --> 24:50.261
clare is mad at Steve

24:50.335 --> 24:51.563
for something that
happened between

24:51.603 --> 24:53.662
you and Steve years ago?
What's the story?

24:53.705 --> 24:54.899
l don't know.

24:54.940 --> 24:56.066
He told me.

24:56.108 --> 24:57.405
l don't get it, though.

24:57.442 --> 24:59.376
l mean, if you ask me,
Steve has a big mouth.

24:59.411 --> 25:01.174
Did l hear somebody
mention my name?

25:01.213 --> 25:02.908
Yes, you did. Why
would you tell clare

25:02.948 --> 25:04.210
about us?

25:04.249 --> 25:06.217
Why would you want to hurt
her feelings like that?

25:06.251 --> 25:08.549
l thought she knew.
Besides, what makes you think

25:08.587 --> 25:10.384
l would hurt clare's feelings
on purpose, Kel?

25:10.422 --> 25:11.650
You know,

25:11.690 --> 25:12.884
l was just getting to know

25:12.925 --> 25:15.052
you two crazy kids
back when all this went on.

25:15.093 --> 25:16.958
Maybe you'd like
to share your pain

25:16.995 --> 25:18.462
with your Uncle Brandon, huh?

25:18.497 --> 25:20.158
No. l don't want to share.

25:20.199 --> 25:21.632
And, Kelly,
l would appreciate it

25:21.667 --> 25:23.658
-if you didn't share, either.
-Fine.

25:23.702 --> 25:26.227
l'm going to go talk to clare,
try to smooth things over.

25:26.338 --> 25:28.636
-Why don't you just let it be?
-No, l won't.

25:28.674 --> 25:30.437
l don't want her
to be mad at me.

25:34.479 --> 25:36.640
okay, it's just you
and me now, big fella.

25:36.682 --> 25:38.650
Give.

25:41.420 --> 25:43.854
Something happened
after Kelly and l broke up,

25:43.889 --> 25:45.754
but l never told anybody.

25:45.791 --> 25:47.952
Not even Kelly?

25:49.261 --> 25:51.161
Not even Kelly.

25:51.196 --> 25:54.290
Actually, l'm not
too proud of it, either.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.491
Maybe now's the time
to come clean.

25:59.538 --> 26:03.030
Yeah, l'm afraid it is.

26:13.919 --> 26:14.943
-oh!
-Whoa!

26:15.988 --> 26:16.977
oh, my God!

26:17.022 --> 26:18.319
What are you guys
doing here?

26:18.357 --> 26:20.621
Ryan, l told you we had
the wrong cabana.

26:20.659 --> 26:22.149
Beth, l'm
really sorry.

26:22.194 --> 26:23.627
We didn't mean it.

26:23.662 --> 26:25.220
You came in here to watch me
shower, didn't you?

26:25.330 --> 26:27.321
And you saw my mother?

26:27.366 --> 26:28.355
Please don't remind us.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.799
You two are disgusting!

26:29.835 --> 26:31.564
Get out before l call security.

26:34.573 --> 26:36.438
Really, Beth, l'm sorry.

26:36.475 --> 26:38.136
Really sorry.

26:38.176 --> 26:39.336
l thought you were
different, Ryan.

26:39.378 --> 26:40.606
l liked you.

26:40.646 --> 26:42.443
We were going to have
such a good time tonight.

26:42.481 --> 26:43.743
We still can.

26:44.783 --> 26:46.842
Don't ever speak to me again.

26:54.059 --> 26:56.493
So what happened with your wife?

26:56.528 --> 26:57.825
Thank you.

26:57.863 --> 26:59.262
How come it didn't work out?

27:02.467 --> 27:04.435
l thought we were here
to talk about business.

27:04.469 --> 27:06.528
Haven't we talked enough
about that already?

27:06.571 --> 27:08.562
okay.

27:10.709 --> 27:14.042
Well, Diane and l
were college sweethearts.

27:14.079 --> 27:17.173
We were both very young
and, um...

27:17.215 --> 27:19.080
very inexperienced.

27:19.117 --> 27:21.347
So are you saying
you weren't in love?

27:21.386 --> 27:23.513
No, no, no.
We were in love.

27:24.923 --> 27:28.359
Like l said, we were just, um,
''inexperienced.''

27:28.393 --> 27:30.725
And by that you mean...?

27:30.762 --> 27:33.959
Um, l never sowed any wild oats,
and neither did she.

27:33.999 --> 27:35.864
Bottom line is,
we just, um,

27:35.901 --> 27:39.962
lost the passion for each other,

27:40.005 --> 27:43.099
and, uh, l started
looking at other women.

27:43.141 --> 27:44.904
And once that happens,
you lose trust

27:44.943 --> 27:46.410
and everything falls apart.

27:46.445 --> 27:48.140
-Any regrets?
-Yeah, a few.

27:48.180 --> 27:50.410
lt's going to be difficult
with my son and all.

27:50.449 --> 27:53.077
Yeah. Sorry.

27:53.118 --> 27:54.642
Hey, life goes on.

27:54.686 --> 27:55.744
Besides, l'm just

27:55.787 --> 27:57.448
learning how to live
my life again.

27:57.489 --> 27:59.457
l'm glad.

28:31.189 --> 28:32.816
Hey.

28:32.858 --> 28:34.155
How's it going, casey?

28:34.192 --> 28:35.921
Silver. lt's been
a long time.

28:35.961 --> 28:38.156
Yeah, not long enough.

28:38.196 --> 28:41.461
David, if you're going to
be rude, please leave.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.730
oh, what, what? Now, now you're
telling me where l can sit?

28:43.769 --> 28:44.861
No, she's asking you

28:44.903 --> 28:46.427
politely to leave us alone.

28:46.471 --> 28:47.768
And if that doesn't

28:47.806 --> 28:50.240
seem to work,
l'm telling you.

28:50.342 --> 28:53.778
oh. That was real convincing.

28:53.812 --> 28:54.836
You know what?

28:54.880 --> 28:57.178
Let's, let's go, okay?

29:04.022 --> 29:05.319
You know what, David?

29:05.357 --> 29:06.949
lf you're trying
to ruin my evening,

29:06.992 --> 29:08.482
you're doing a really good job.

29:08.527 --> 29:10.119
Donna, l'm not trying
to ruin anything.

29:10.162 --> 29:12.323
l just, l can't stand seeing
you with this goofball.

29:12.364 --> 29:14.423
Leave me alone.

29:14.466 --> 29:16.627
You said you couldn't
count on me, so don't.

29:26.511 --> 29:28.103
-l didn't do a thing!
-You ruined everything!

29:28.146 --> 29:30.444
-lt was already ruined!
-Hey, hey, hey...

29:30.482 --> 29:31.779
Brothers,
what's going on here?

29:31.817 --> 29:33.341
He's an idiot,
that's what's wrong.

29:33.385 --> 29:35.148
Hey, if we hadn't
have gotten caught,

29:35.187 --> 29:36.415
you would not be
complaining right now.

29:36.455 --> 29:38.719
-Shh. Hey, what happened?
-He had the bright idea

29:38.757 --> 29:40.190
to sneak into Beth's cabana
so we could take

29:40.225 --> 29:42.022
a look at her
coming out of the shower.

29:42.060 --> 29:44.221
-You what?
-lt was his idea!

29:44.262 --> 29:46.162
Get over here.

29:46.198 --> 29:48.029
How stupid can
you guys be?

29:48.066 --> 29:49.727
Hey, like you never
did anything like that.

29:49.768 --> 29:51.998
So that makes it smart?

29:52.037 --> 29:53.504
Look, all l know is, l've
ruined everything with Beth,

29:53.538 --> 29:54.596
and it's his fault.

29:54.639 --> 29:55.936
No, no, no, it's
both of your faults.

29:55.974 --> 29:57.703
When are you guys going
to learn, you've got to respect

29:57.742 --> 29:59.334
women if you want them
to respect you back?

29:59.377 --> 30:01.242
l don't want them to respect me,
l just want to get...

30:01.279 --> 30:02.576
Hey, shut up!

30:02.614 --> 30:04.104
You know, this may come
as a surprise to you,

30:04.149 --> 30:05.377
but women are people, too.

30:05.417 --> 30:06.714
You actually think that

30:06.751 --> 30:08.150
that's a way to a
woman's heart?

30:08.186 --> 30:09.380
Let me tell
you something,

30:09.421 --> 30:10.945
it's not.

30:10.989 --> 30:12.718
l learned that the hard way.

30:12.757 --> 30:14.622
l don't want to see
you guys make the same

30:14.659 --> 30:16.217
mistakes that l made,
you understand me?

30:16.261 --> 30:17.728
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

30:17.762 --> 30:20.230
lf l see you guys pull a stunt
like this again,

30:20.265 --> 30:22.233
we're through.

30:22.267 --> 30:23.757
'cause l've had it with you.

30:25.070 --> 30:26.401
You got it?

30:26.438 --> 30:27.462
You got it?!

30:27.506 --> 30:29.838
-Yeah.
-Now, get out of here

30:29.875 --> 30:32.571
before l bonk
your heads together.

30:32.611 --> 30:35.079
That was pretty good.

30:36.781 --> 30:39.079
l'm proud of you.

30:39.117 --> 30:40.948
l wish it was something
that someone told me

30:40.986 --> 30:41.975
when l was young.

30:42.020 --> 30:44.682
l talked to Kelly.

30:44.723 --> 30:47.089
And... l think

30:47.125 --> 30:48.888
whatever you guys
are working through,

30:48.927 --> 30:50.451
it's bringing out
the best in you.

30:52.264 --> 30:54.391
Well, you ready to go home?

30:54.432 --> 30:55.729
No, l can't.

30:55.767 --> 30:56.995
l got to take care of something.

30:57.035 --> 30:58.730
Do you mind?

30:58.770 --> 31:00.237
No.

31:00.272 --> 31:02.331
Go.

31:02.374 --> 31:03.841
Get it out of your system.

31:10.215 --> 31:13.480
Thanks for being
so understanding, clare.

31:18.790 --> 31:21.816
Well, l would,
uh, invite you in,

31:21.860 --> 31:23.794
but l wouldn't
want my roommates

31:23.828 --> 31:25.557
to get the wrong idea.

31:25.597 --> 31:27.758
And what idea is that?

31:29.434 --> 31:31.527
l'm a cPA and you're my client.

31:32.904 --> 31:35.771
Yeah, l was going to say that.

31:35.807 --> 31:38.139
Now the big question.

31:38.176 --> 31:39.609
What are you doing tomorrow?

31:39.644 --> 31:42.272
l was going to go
to the beach club.

31:42.347 --> 31:43.541
You were?

31:43.582 --> 31:45.607
So was l.

31:45.650 --> 31:46.776
l'll see you, then?

31:46.818 --> 31:48.786
Yeah.

31:48.820 --> 31:50.151
okay.

32:01.900 --> 32:02.958
Good night.

32:03.001 --> 32:04.332
Good night.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.523
Hey, Kel.

32:30.562 --> 32:32.257
-Hi.
-can l talk to you?

32:32.330 --> 32:35.060
Sure. How's clare?

32:35.100 --> 32:37.261
-She's okay.
-Good.

32:39.104 --> 32:40.264
Kel, you remember
the spring dance

32:40.372 --> 32:42.237
in tenth grade?

32:42.274 --> 32:44.742
lt seems like
a lifetime ago,

32:44.776 --> 32:45.765
but l remember it.

32:45.810 --> 32:47.243
l was the queen of the dance.

32:47.279 --> 32:49.042
-How could l forget?
-Yeah.

32:49.080 --> 32:52.413
Remember l got drunk,
and we got into a fight?

32:52.450 --> 32:54.748
Yes.

32:54.786 --> 32:56.481
But to be honest with you,

32:56.521 --> 32:59.217
l don't have the faintest idea
what we were fighting over.

32:59.257 --> 33:01.316
Kelly, did you know that night

33:01.359 --> 33:03.691
we made love at the beach club
was my first time?

33:03.728 --> 33:05.787
l didn't know that.

33:05.830 --> 33:08.594
l thought
you were Mr. Experience.

33:08.633 --> 33:12.228
Yeah, l wanted everybody
to think that.

33:13.905 --> 33:15.930
l wish you would have told me.

33:15.974 --> 33:18.738
l wish
l would have told you, too.

33:18.777 --> 33:20.244
ln fact, there was

33:20.345 --> 33:22.142
a lot of things
l would have done differently.

33:22.180 --> 33:23.204
Like what?

33:23.248 --> 33:24.237
Well, when
we did it,

33:24.316 --> 33:26.546
it was a big thing for me.

33:26.584 --> 33:29.951
But it really didn't seem
like a big thing for you.

33:29.988 --> 33:33.617
Well, l was a lot different
then, too.

33:33.658 --> 33:35.649
Yeah.

33:35.694 --> 33:38.663
But l did something afterwards.

33:40.131 --> 33:42.099
l did something bad, Kelly...

33:42.133 --> 33:43.998
to you.

33:44.035 --> 33:45.559
What is this all about?

33:45.603 --> 33:47.628
You can tell me. lt's okay.

33:47.672 --> 33:49.663
okay.

33:52.444 --> 33:54.412
After you broke up
with me, Kelly,

33:54.446 --> 33:56.573
l started spreading rumors
about you.

33:56.614 --> 33:58.741
What are you talking about?

33:58.783 --> 34:02.412
l told anyone that would listen
that you were a slut,

34:02.454 --> 34:04.649
and that you'd
sleep with anybody.

34:04.689 --> 34:06.350
lt was me, Kelly.

34:06.391 --> 34:09.360
l was the one who spread
all those rumors about you,

34:09.393 --> 34:11.692
and l'm to blame

34:11.730 --> 34:13.094
for the horrible
reputation

34:13.130 --> 34:15.190
you had at West Beverly
all those years.

34:15.233 --> 34:17.201
How could you do that?

34:17.235 --> 34:18.896
l thought we were friends.

34:18.937 --> 34:20.335
l know. l...

34:20.371 --> 34:23.534
lt's just, once the ball
got rolling, l couldn't stop it.

34:23.574 --> 34:25.509
l'm sorry.

34:25.543 --> 34:26.737
You bastard.

34:26.777 --> 34:29.246
Do you know how long
l had to live with that?

34:29.313 --> 34:31.179
Do you know
how long that followed me?

34:32.384 --> 34:34.351
And the worst part is,

34:34.386 --> 34:36.353
l became that girl.

34:36.388 --> 34:38.049
l became the slut
that everybody

34:38.089 --> 34:40.819
thought l was,
and l am still getting over it.

34:40.859 --> 34:42.349
-l'm sorry.
-Yeah, well, sorry

34:42.393 --> 34:44.692
does not make up
for what you put me through!

34:58.176 --> 34:59.700
Listen, buddy,
the important thing is,

34:59.744 --> 35:01.109
is that you told her.

35:01.146 --> 35:02.943
You came clean
about the whole thing.

35:02.981 --> 35:04.380
Yeah, just a little late.

35:04.416 --> 35:05.542
Five years.

35:05.583 --> 35:06.709
Five years.

35:06.751 --> 35:08.218
You know, Brandon,
l don't think

35:08.319 --> 35:09.843
she's gonna forgive
me for this.

35:09.888 --> 35:11.014
Well...

35:11.055 --> 35:13.148
You think you could
talk to her for me?

35:13.191 --> 35:14.818
You want me
to work on her?

35:14.859 --> 35:16.224
l don't know
what l want.

35:16.294 --> 35:17.693
Look, Steve, you
want my advice?

35:17.729 --> 35:19.321
Just give it
some time, man.

35:19.364 --> 35:20.797
Give her
a little space,

35:20.832 --> 35:22.356
this whole thing
will blow over.

35:22.400 --> 35:23.958
So, l'm off to the beach club,

35:24.002 --> 35:25.765
though it's the last place
in the world

35:25.804 --> 35:27.328
l feel like being today.

35:27.372 --> 35:29.363
-So, don't go.
-No.

35:29.407 --> 35:31.204
l can't disappoint clare.

35:31.242 --> 35:33.472
She's been very understanding
through all this.

35:34.279 --> 35:35.541
Hey, good morning.

35:35.580 --> 35:37.810
Yeah, in some
parts of the world.

35:37.849 --> 35:38.975
Poor Steve.

35:39.017 --> 35:40.143
He told you, huh?

35:40.185 --> 35:42.153
Yeah, more than
l wanted to hear.

35:42.187 --> 35:43.620
-Hmm.
-But let's face it.

35:43.655 --> 35:45.987
lf he hadn't have spread
those rumors about Kelly,

35:46.024 --> 35:47.150
somebody would have.

35:47.192 --> 35:48.682
You know what, Val?

35:48.726 --> 35:50.717
l'm really getting tired
of you badmouthing Kelly.

35:50.762 --> 35:54.254
She's a friend of mine, so if
you want to do it, that's fine.

35:54.299 --> 35:55.766
Just do it somewhere else.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.859
-okay?
-okay. l'm sorry.

35:57.902 --> 35:59.096
You going to the beach club?

35:59.137 --> 36:00.502
Yeah. l'm gonna meet Kenny
there.

36:00.538 --> 36:02.836
-Really?
-Yeah, he's been unbelievable.

36:02.874 --> 36:04.535
can't imagine how much
he's helped out the After Dark.

36:04.576 --> 36:05.702
So now you're going

36:05.743 --> 36:07.643
to spend the day with him
at the beach?

36:07.679 --> 36:09.510
-lsn't he married?
-He was.

36:09.547 --> 36:11.208
-He's separated now.
-Hmm...

36:11.316 --> 36:13.841
Better be careful, Val,

36:13.885 --> 36:16.547
or someone's going to start
spreading rumors about you.

36:23.995 --> 36:25.019
Hey, Kel.

36:25.063 --> 36:27.691
l'll catch up with you.

36:27.732 --> 36:29.029
-Hi.
-Hey.

36:29.067 --> 36:31.501
You know, there's
an egg toss here today.

36:31.536 --> 36:33.060
Be my partner?

36:33.104 --> 36:35.129
-No, thanks.
-What, Kelly?

36:35.173 --> 36:36.367
What do l got to do?

36:36.407 --> 36:37.431
l said l was sorry.

36:37.475 --> 36:38.908
l don't know.

36:40.245 --> 36:41.906
l'm a different
person now, Kelly.

36:41.946 --> 36:43.937
So am l.

36:43.982 --> 36:46.075
l never should've told her.

36:50.154 --> 36:52.281
Haven't you heard
that the sun'll kill ya?

36:53.925 --> 36:55.620
Well, at least
l'll look good when l go.

36:55.660 --> 36:57.252
-Yeah.
-Well, sit down.

36:57.328 --> 36:59.091
-Make yourself comfortable.
-Thanks.

37:00.598 --> 37:02.657
So, uh, tell me more

37:02.700 --> 37:03.894
-about your son.
-Michael?

37:03.935 --> 37:05.459
You'll love him.
He's a good boy.

37:05.503 --> 37:06.993
Hey!

37:07.038 --> 37:08.130
Kelly, hi.

37:08.172 --> 37:09.730
How are you?

37:09.774 --> 37:11.002
l'm great.
How are you?

37:11.042 --> 37:13.203
-Good to see you.
-How are Diane and Michael?

37:13.278 --> 37:14.745
Good, good.
They're back East right now.

37:14.779 --> 37:16.110
oh, good.

37:16.147 --> 37:19.913
Uh, l'm sure you two
know each other. Hmm?

37:19.951 --> 37:21.213
Yeah. How're you
doing, Kel?

37:21.319 --> 37:22.786
Terrific.

37:25.390 --> 37:27.119
Uh, Kenny's helping me out
with the books

37:27.158 --> 37:28.648
-for the After Dark.
-Ah.

37:28.693 --> 37:30.991
Good. Well, see you guys around.

37:31.029 --> 37:32.690
okay, bye-bye.

37:33.698 --> 37:34.824
How do you know her?

37:34.866 --> 37:36.663
Uh, when Michael was an infant,

37:36.701 --> 37:38.328
she used to babysit for us
all the time.

37:38.369 --> 37:40.166
She knows my wife very well.

37:40.204 --> 37:41.364
Are you guys good friends?

37:41.406 --> 37:43.499
Good enemies.

37:51.416 --> 37:53.407
What are you doing here?

37:54.919 --> 37:57.717
l just, l came to apologize.

37:57.755 --> 38:00.519
l was way out of line
last night.

38:02.026 --> 38:04.153
Do you want to come in
or have some coffee?

38:04.195 --> 38:05.924
No. No, no, um...

38:07.398 --> 38:09.992
Look, l've...

38:10.034 --> 38:11.433
l've been real stressed out.

38:11.469 --> 38:13.596
But l'm going to
try really hard

38:13.638 --> 38:15.071
not to take it out on you.

38:15.106 --> 38:17.574
Thanks.

38:17.609 --> 38:19.008
l appreciate that.

38:21.713 --> 38:24.910
So, uh, are you going to be
down at the beach later?

38:24.949 --> 38:26.576
-Yeah.
-Maybe we can

38:26.618 --> 38:27.949
hang out.

38:27.986 --> 38:29.749
Maybe.

38:35.760 --> 38:38.695
We tried, but it just didn't
work out for us, did it?

38:38.730 --> 38:40.527
l guess not.

38:44.435 --> 38:45.925
Still friends?

38:47.739 --> 38:50.640
Yeah, always.

39:04.589 --> 39:05.988
Well, l'll see you down there.

39:06.024 --> 39:07.184
Later.

39:07.291 --> 39:09.282
okay.

39:23.708 --> 39:25.505
Kelly, we weren't
finished out there.

39:25.543 --> 39:26.908
-Steve, l know...
-Quiet.

39:26.944 --> 39:29.003
Let me talk a second.

39:29.047 --> 39:30.674
l'm sorry.

39:32.717 --> 39:34.514
l am, too.

39:34.552 --> 39:37.180
l've been a jerk
all night.

39:37.221 --> 39:38.415
Me, too.

39:38.456 --> 39:40.686
l know.

39:40.725 --> 39:44.525
But despite all the things
we've gone through,

39:44.562 --> 39:47.030
all the fights
and all the stupid things

39:47.065 --> 39:49.192
we've ever said to each other,

39:49.233 --> 39:50.996
l still love you, Kelly.

39:51.035 --> 39:52.935
And l don't care
what you say,

39:52.970 --> 39:54.562
because l know
deep down inside,

39:54.605 --> 39:57.199
you love me, too.

39:57.241 --> 39:59.709
Maybe.

39:59.744 --> 40:01.575
But not the way you mean.

40:01.612 --> 40:04.240
There's lots of different ways
of loving someone.

40:05.583 --> 40:07.710
Then l guess
in my own way,

40:07.752 --> 40:09.242
l love you, too, Steve.

40:10.421 --> 40:11.752
Happy Birthday.

40:15.460 --> 40:17.394
could l get another one
right here?

40:17.428 --> 40:18.725
You know the spot.

40:18.763 --> 40:20.424
come on.

40:26.270 --> 40:28.568
Kel!

40:28.606 --> 40:30.597
Kelly!

40:31.843 --> 40:33.538
l was just thinking
about you.

40:33.578 --> 40:35.409
Kelly, you got to forgive me.

40:35.446 --> 40:37.744
l know what l did
was unforgivable.

40:37.782 --> 40:39.079
But my life's not going to be

40:39.117 --> 40:40.414
as good a place
unless you're in it.

40:40.451 --> 40:43.386
l wish you would've
thought of that back then.

40:43.421 --> 40:45.218
So do l.

40:47.959 --> 40:51.588
You asked me if l remembered
the spring dance.

40:51.629 --> 40:52.823
Well, l do.

40:54.699 --> 40:57.065
l remember that we said we loved
each other that night.

40:58.302 --> 41:00.031
The thing of it is,
l said so many

41:00.071 --> 41:03.006
horrible things about you,
even after that night, l...

41:05.243 --> 41:06.767
l'm so sorry.

41:08.813 --> 41:11.475
l'm just glad that
you were honest with me.

41:13.417 --> 41:15.112
Having you tell me
the truth now

41:15.153 --> 41:17.246
makes up for anything
that you could've done.

41:17.321 --> 41:19.118
l was kind of hoping
you'd say that.

41:33.938 --> 41:35.064
You look great.

41:35.106 --> 41:36.471
Thanks.

41:37.775 --> 41:39.902
Listen, Kenny, uh,

41:39.944 --> 41:42.913
l feel really uncomfortable
being here.

41:42.947 --> 41:44.141
Why?

41:44.182 --> 41:47.049
l saw your wife's
bathing suit in there.

41:47.084 --> 41:48.210
lt just doesn't feel right.

41:48.252 --> 41:49.276
Don't worry about it.

41:49.387 --> 41:51.821
l mean,
l'm not worried about it.

41:51.856 --> 41:53.448
Just relax.

41:53.491 --> 41:55.755
l got something for you.

41:57.428 --> 42:00.090
This is my way

42:00.131 --> 42:02.895
of showing you that
l believe in you

42:02.934 --> 42:04.367
and your club.

42:04.402 --> 42:05.835
open it.

42:08.239 --> 42:09.729
$10,000?

42:09.774 --> 42:12.572
-You're giving me $10,000?
-You'll pay me back.

42:12.610 --> 42:14.771
lt should take a little time
before the other money comes in,

42:14.812 --> 42:16.939
so that should cover you.

42:18.749 --> 42:19.943
l don't know what to say.

42:19.984 --> 42:21.008
Don't say anything.

42:21.052 --> 42:22.952
Just know there's somebody

42:22.987 --> 42:24.579
in your corner.

42:26.190 --> 42:27.350
okay?

42:28.793 --> 42:30.784
Thanks.

42:36.834 --> 42:38.165
oh!

42:40.972 --> 42:42.599
Ahh!

42:48.913 --> 42:50.073
ooh...

42:54.852 --> 42:57.082
Well, it looks like you two
got things worked out.

42:57.121 --> 42:58.645
Yeah, we did.

42:58.689 --> 42:59.656
lt felt good to forgive someone.

42:59.690 --> 43:00.679
Not as good as it felt

43:00.725 --> 43:01.885
to scramble that egg

43:01.926 --> 43:03.052
on Stevie's chest.

43:04.262 --> 43:06.196
-We were all just young
and stupid. - Hey!

43:06.230 --> 43:07.959
l think l'm still
young and stupid.

43:07.999 --> 43:09.398
lt really reminded me

43:09.433 --> 43:12.402
of how strong the bonds are
between all of us, you know?

43:12.436 --> 43:15.200
But it felt really good

43:15.239 --> 43:16.604
to be alone this summer.

43:16.641 --> 43:18.165
Help me figure out who l am.

43:18.209 --> 43:20.234
That's the way l felt
about my trip, too.

43:20.344 --> 43:22.005
lt's good to see we're
on the same page.

43:22.046 --> 43:23.741
Are we?

43:23.781 --> 43:26.545
Well, maybe not exactly
the same page.

43:26.584 --> 43:29.212
A couple pages apart; certainly
in the same chapter, though.

43:29.253 --> 43:31.551
Do you ever think that

43:31.589 --> 43:33.921
we'll be in the same place
with each other?

43:33.958 --> 43:37.018
lf the time's right for the two
of us, we'll know it.

43:37.061 --> 43:38.426
And if it isn't?

43:38.462 --> 43:41.431
Well, then we'll know that,
too, won't we?

43:41.465 --> 43:43.399
Yeah, l guess we will.
