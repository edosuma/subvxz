00:02.840 --> 00:04.955
Two white wines
and a Jack and ginger.

00:05.720 --> 00:08.029
Please tell me the Jack and ginger
isn't for you.

00:08.200 --> 00:10.191
No, it's for my girlfriend. Why?

00:10.920 --> 00:13.150
You look like a woman of
discriminating taste...

00:13.320 --> 00:15.595
...and mixing a quality
bourbon with ginger ale...

00:15.760 --> 00:19.309
...is like putting Cheez Whiz
on lobster Newburgh.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.108
Well, what if I said
the Jack and ginger was for me?

00:23.680 --> 00:26.194
Well, then, I'd learn to live with it.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.514
- Charlie.
- Gail.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.829
Sorry I'm late. I stopped off at Radio
Barn, and wait till you see what I got.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.956
Alan, I'm kind of in the middle of...

00:39.760 --> 00:41.398
Damn you to hell.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.630
- What? What did I do?
- Forget it.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.836
It's who you are,
you can't help yourself.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.279
Okay. Anyway, check this out.
Know what that is?

00:49.960 --> 00:53.953
- A two megapixel, full-color webcam.
- Right.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.395
How do I do it?

00:56.600 --> 00:59.672
I got one for me and for Jake.
We can hook them to our computers...

00:59.840 --> 01:02.434
...so when he's at his mother's,
we can have video chats.

01:02.600 --> 01:03.794
- That's cool.
- Isn't it?

01:03.960 --> 01:07.475
Yeah, with a couple of these, phone sex
becomes less phone and more sex.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.355
These are to maintain
my relationship with Jake.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.112
It's the worst part of the divorce:

01:12.280 --> 01:14.840
- Only seeing him on weekends.
- I get that. I sympathize.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.753
But you can see the validity
of my vision too, right?

01:18.720 --> 01:23.077
Oh, look. Built-in microphone.
Totally hands-free. Perfect.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.919
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hey, Gail. Good to see you again.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.798
Don't move, don't talk.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.399
- Are you Charlie Harper?
- Yeah. Why?

01:32.560 --> 01:35.597
You were right. It's him.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.078
What...? What...? What's funny?

01:40.240 --> 01:41.958
Nothing.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.472
So listen, can I buy you a drink?

01:47.800 --> 01:49.756
He wants to buy me a drink.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.595
Then what? We go back
to your beach house...

01:53.760 --> 01:57.719
...sit on the deck, look at the stars, talk
about how you love being an uncle...

01:57.880 --> 01:59.996
...and how you'd
like kids of your own...

02:00.160 --> 02:03.357
...and by the way, I have the
most beautiful eyes in the world.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.074
I'm sorry. Have we met before?

02:06.760 --> 02:09.193
No. And we're not gonna meet now.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.355
Okay. I have a bad feeling.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.671
Is the camera on?

02:25.960 --> 02:27.996
Good. Now, hit "connect."

02:28.200 --> 02:30.839
<i>I can see you. Can you see me?</i>

02:31.840 --> 02:34.638
Yeah, yeah. I can hear you too.
You can hang up the phone.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.392
<i>This is awesome.</i>

02:36.560 --> 02:39.518
- Yeah, we can see each other every day.
- <i>Cool.</i>

02:43.880 --> 02:45.438
So...

02:46.160 --> 02:47.479
What's new?

02:47.640 --> 02:49.153
<i>Nothing.</i>

02:52.040 --> 02:54.076
<i>What's new with you?</i>

02:56.160 --> 02:57.752
Not much.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.791
- Hey, Charlie.
- Rose, stop.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.595
- What?
- We're friends now, right?

03:13.080 --> 03:14.115
Right.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.955
Our one-night stand is ancient history.
You're not stalking me anymore, right?

03:18.120 --> 03:21.510
- Right.
- Then use the damn stairs.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.915
- Really?
- Yes.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.593
Okay.

03:29.880 --> 03:33.759
- I'm opening up the gate.
- I'm proud of you.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.469
- I'm starting up the stairs.
- You can do it.

03:39.240 --> 03:40.912
Oh, boy.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.514
I don't know about this.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.236
- You'll get used to it.
- Yeah, we'll see.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.991
I'm surprised to see you home.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.594
- It's ladies' night at Pavlov's.
- I know.

03:53.760 --> 03:57.275
Well, isn't that kind of like
rabbit season for Elmer Fudd?

03:57.720 --> 03:59.119
Used to be.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.838
Let me ask you question.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.754
How much do chicks talk
about men they've been with?

04:04.200 --> 04:05.599
Not as much as you'd think.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.109
- Really?
- Way more.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.794
- Why?
- Well, I ran into some women last night.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.234
Never met them before.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.072
But they seem to have already formed
a poor opinion of me.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.398
So you think somebody's out there
spreading nasty rumors?

04:19.560 --> 04:23.269
Worse. I think somebody's out there
spreading the truth.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.074
Well, you have burned
a few bridges in this town.

04:26.240 --> 04:30.279
Hey, I don't burn bridges.
I have casual sex with relative strangers.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.237
There's a difference.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.473
And I'm always honest.

04:34.640 --> 04:39.156
I never lead a woman on.
Unless I'm, you know, totally bombed.

04:40.440 --> 04:44.513
Last night was probably the result
of one woman with an ax to grind.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.159
Probably.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.719
Yeah, that's it.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.952
- I'm making myself crazy over nothing.
- Oh, I do that all the time.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.395
It's a great way to fill up
a slow weekend.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.190
Rose, that night we spent together...

04:57.360 --> 04:59.191
...did I tell you
you had beautiful eyes?

05:00.080 --> 05:03.959
Well, let's see. We had a couple
of drinks, you invited me back here.

05:04.120 --> 05:07.635
We were sitting out on the deck,
looking at the stars.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.552
And, yeah, you said:

05:09.720 --> 05:13.235
"By the way, you have
the most beautiful eyes in the world."

05:14.960 --> 05:16.871
I guess I do use that a lot.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.519
But, damn it, it's good.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.914
<i>Are you sure it's not red?</i>
<i>Look again.</i>

05:26.800 --> 05:31.078
It looks fine.
You have to go to school tomorrow.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.748
- Good night, Rose.
- Night, Charlie.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.070
And don't forget to use the...

05:37.320 --> 05:38.912
Never mind.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.513
Oh, Charlie, Charlie.
Come here.

05:40.680 --> 05:43.433
- Say hello to your Uncle Charlie.
- <i>Hey, Uncle Charlie.</i>

05:43.600 --> 05:45.909
- Hi, Jake.
- <i>I can see you.</i>

05:46.080 --> 05:47.752
I can see you too.

05:48.520 --> 05:49.999
<i>So...</i>

05:50.480 --> 05:52.072
<i>What's new?</i>

05:52.240 --> 05:54.674
Not much.
What's new with you?

05:54.840 --> 05:56.512
<i>Nothing. Oh, wait.</i>
<i>I Googled you...</i>

05:56.680 --> 05:58.432
<i>... and you'll never guess</i>
<i>what I found.</i>

05:58.600 --> 06:00.556
<i>Jake, are you in the bathtub?</i>

06:00.720 --> 06:02.153
<i>Yeah. Gotta go.</i>

06:02.320 --> 06:04.629
No, no, no. Wait, Jake,
what are you talking about?

06:04.800 --> 06:06.552
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.234
But if you Google me,
you'll find pages that mention...

06:09.400 --> 06:12.392
...my San Fernando Valley
Chiropractor of the Year award.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.278
That's nice.
Get out of the way.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.638
Oh, careful. There's another
Alan J. Harper.

06:19.800 --> 06:23.679
He's a school bus driver, and he also
makes these decorative pigs...

06:23.840 --> 06:26.400
...out of bleach bottles
and pipe cleaners.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.869
I'm not Googling you.
I'm Googling me.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.549
"CharlieHarperSucks. Com."

06:36.800 --> 06:38.995
That's gotta be a different
Charlie Harper.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.354
Okay.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.238
I have a bad feeling.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.679
Oh, boy.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.316
Oh, man.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.750
Oh, crap.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.393
- Are you still reading that thing?
- How can I not?

07:04.560 --> 07:07.313
It's an entire website
devoted to trashing me.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.754
Listen to this:

07:08.920 --> 07:12.674
"Has anybody had sex with Charlie
where he actually took his socks off?"

07:14.080 --> 07:16.594
That's just mean.
I have bad circulation in my feet.

07:16.760 --> 07:18.796
They get cold.

07:19.200 --> 07:23.239
Check this out. Some girl posted audio
off her answering machine.

07:25.240 --> 07:28.437
<i>Hey, it's me. I just wanted to tell you</i>
<i>I had a great time last night.</i>

07:28.600 --> 07:31.353
- <i>And I'm looking forward...</i>
- <i>Hello, Charlie?</i>

07:31.520 --> 07:33.351
<i>Yeah, hi.</i>

07:33.520 --> 07:35.795
<i>We weren 't together last night.</i>

07:37.280 --> 07:38.713
<i>Allison?</i>

07:38.880 --> 07:40.950
<i>No, Beth.</i>

07:41.120 --> 07:42.189
<i>Thursday.</i>

07:42.800 --> 07:46.429
<i>I had a great time with you Thursday,</i>
<i>and I thought that may...</i>

07:47.000 --> 07:49.389
Oh, Alan, what am I gonna do?

07:49.560 --> 07:51.790
Every woman in the city
can see this stuff.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.598
Every woman in the world.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.472
Oh, God.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.949
Well, you know what they say.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.350
Any publicity is...

08:00.520 --> 08:02.511
Good publicity.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.075
No, no, no.
What I do requires secrecy.

08:05.240 --> 08:08.471
I need shadows and darkness.
I'm like a magician.

08:08.640 --> 08:12.679
If everybody knows how I do it,
it ceases to be entertaining.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.158
"Frequently Asked Questions."

08:16.320 --> 08:17.799
- Don't read that.
- Yeah, right.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.110
Okay. Question:

08:20.320 --> 08:23.869
"How long can you expect to date
Charlie after you have sex with him?"

08:24.040 --> 08:26.918
Answer: " It depends how late
you sleep the next morning."

08:28.400 --> 08:31.915
Oh, come on. This is funny.
You're just too close to it.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.395
This could be interesting. Question:

08:35.559 --> 08:38.357
"How does Charlie manage
to fake my orgasm?"

08:38.520 --> 08:40.715
All right, stop it. Move over.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.996
- What are you doing?
- I've gotta fight back.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.435
Anybody can post on the message board.
Why not me?

08:45.600 --> 08:47.989
- You're gonna post as yourself?
- Don't be ridiculous.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.878
Everybody uses a screen name.

08:50.080 --> 08:53.072
"CharlieFreak219."

08:53.240 --> 08:54.912
Too many?

08:55.160 --> 08:56.798
Okay.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.231
CharlieFreak180.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.995
"In my experience...

09:05.680 --> 09:09.229
...Charlie has always been...

09:09.400 --> 09:11.914
...a generous lover...

09:12.080 --> 09:15.993
...compassionate, fun-Ioving
and sensitive."

09:16.160 --> 09:19.630
There. That ought to bring
a little balance to the conversation.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.473
You really don't get the Internet,
do you?

09:24.240 --> 09:27.118
Oh, look. I've got a response already.

09:27.280 --> 09:30.716
"Dear Freak: Are you just stupid...

09:30.880 --> 09:34.589
...or did your skull bounce off
his headboard too many times?"

09:34.760 --> 09:36.876
Okay, I've had enough of this.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.430
- How do I delete this whole thing?
- You can't delete a website.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.511
Only the person who created it can.

09:42.680 --> 09:46.036
- Well, how do I find out who created it?
- Now, let's see. Come on.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.236
Okay.

09:49.040 --> 09:53.033
Okay, the domain is the property of a
company in the Cayman Islands called:

09:54.280 --> 09:57.113
"Charlie Harper Sucks Limited."

09:57.920 --> 09:59.194
Well, that's no help.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.910
Hey, you can buy T-shirts
and coffee mugs.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.469
"Add to cart."

10:12.280 --> 10:14.874
<i>No, Mom, it is not that simple.</i>

10:15.040 --> 10:18.237
<i>I am a single mother now.</i>
<i>Dating is very complicated.</i>

10:19.440 --> 10:21.158
<i>I understand.</i>

10:21.320 --> 10:23.550
<i>No, I can 't go back to Alan.</i>

10:23.720 --> 10:25.312
<i>Of course I still love him.</i>

10:26.600 --> 10:28.158
Hey, Alan?

10:28.320 --> 10:30.675
How long you think this Internet fad
is gonna last?

10:31.160 --> 10:32.479
- <i>Okay.</i>
- What?

10:32.960 --> 10:35.793
Jake must've turned on his webcam
before he went to school.

10:35.960 --> 10:39.839
I can see and hear Judith
talking to her mother on the phone.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.195
- Why can't she hear us?
- Our side's turned off.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.238
<i>Are you kidding? Alan would never</i>
<i>take me back. How do I know?</i>

10:45.400 --> 10:47.038
<i>I just know.</i>

10:47.200 --> 10:48.838
<i>Okay, fine. I'll ask him.</i>

10:49.920 --> 10:51.956
- She wants me back.
- <i>Yes, I will ask him.</i>

10:52.120 --> 10:53.633
That's nice. It's all about you.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.153
<i>Okay.</i>

10:55.320 --> 10:57.356
<i>Listen, Mom, I gotta get in the shower.</i>

10:58.000 --> 10:59.718
<i>I got it. Yes.</i>

11:01.720 --> 11:04.393
<i>All right. I'll call you later.</i>

11:06.880 --> 11:08.871
Oh, man.

11:10.040 --> 11:13.715
- Charlie, I need to talk about this.
- Me too.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.916
If I don't do something
about that website...

11:16.080 --> 11:18.036
...I'm gonna have to chase
Amish broads.

11:18.360 --> 11:20.749
Judith wants to reconcile.
I've dreamed about this...

11:20.920 --> 11:23.514
...but now that it's here,
I wonder if it's what I want.

11:23.680 --> 11:27.275
Whoever put up that site has to be
somebody I went out with at least once.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.238
It would be great for Jake
to have both parents in one house.

11:30.400 --> 11:34.075
And without alimony, I could stop
getting my hair cut at the barber college.

11:34.240 --> 11:37.312
I can eliminate married chicks,
ones that don't speak English...

11:37.480 --> 11:39.914
...and those to whom
I was never properly introduced.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.753
I'll make a list of the pros and cons
of going back to her.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.388
You know what?
I'm gonna need to make a list.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.950
- I'm glad we talked.
- I'm always here for you.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.553
Me too.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.830
Hi, Tina. Long time, huh?

12:06.000 --> 12:09.037
Charlie Harper. What do you want?

12:10.400 --> 12:12.868
I know things didn't end well
between us, and...

12:13.040 --> 12:14.951
Really? I thought they ended perfectly.

12:15.120 --> 12:18.510
We spent a week in Cancún,
having great sex every day.

12:18.680 --> 12:21.911
Flew back to L.A. You told me you'd
call me tomorrow, and it's been...

12:22.080 --> 12:24.310
What do you know?
A year and a half.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.156
- That long?
- Oh, yeah.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.278
I guess time flies when
you're the scum of the earth.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.279
Okay, I had that coming.

12:33.520 --> 12:37.798
I was thoughtless and insensitive, and I
know I can never really make up for it...

12:37.960 --> 12:44.274
...but I want you to know that I was
wrong, and I'm really, truly sorry.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.760
- And...?
- No "and."

12:47.920 --> 12:51.435
I just wanted to apologize for
being a jerk. I wanna make amends.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.839
- You really mean that, don't you?
- I do. Absolutely.

12:56.680 --> 13:00.719
- You wanna come in for a cup of coffee?
- Sure, I guess.

13:01.560 --> 13:04.154
So, seeing anybody?

13:10.040 --> 13:14.556
"Pro: No alimony. Con: No sex."

13:16.000 --> 13:19.879
"Pro: See Jake all the time.
Con: See Judith all the time."

13:20.040 --> 13:21.553
What are you doing? Give me that.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.154
- I'm sorry. It was just laying there.
- That's private.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.799
Okay.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.400
I got another "pro" for you.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.599
- Yeah? What's that?
- Lf you hook back up with Olive Oyl...

13:36.760 --> 13:39.354
...I won't have to scrub your toilet
anymore.

13:40.440 --> 13:44.991
Pro: No more Berta.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.989
You're not really thinking about
going back, are you?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.355
I don't know.
She wants to, but I'm torn.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.511
You're not torn. You're gutless.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.311
- Do you still love her?
- Of course I do.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.916
I mean, you know, we've been though
a lot of things together.

14:00.080 --> 14:04.198
- She's the mother of my son.
- Okay, listen to me, Zippy.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.471
If that's all it took
to make a marriage...

14:06.640 --> 14:08.676
...I'd have a husband
for each of my tattoos.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.349
- You have tattoos?
- Yeah. You wanna see them?

14:14.280 --> 14:15.554
No.

14:15.960 --> 14:19.350
You're overthinking this. When your
dog dies, you don't make a list.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.238
You bury him, plant a shrub on top...

14:21.400 --> 14:24.597
...tell the kids he's running around
a farm, and move on.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.350
That's actually a very apt metaphor.

14:28.520 --> 14:31.751
My failed marriage is like a dead dog.

14:31.920 --> 14:35.913
But it serves as fertilizer for the shrub,
which represents my new life.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.908
So if I try to revitalize the marriage...
You know, digging up the dog.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.719
- Then I'm killing the shrub,
which is me.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.392
Like you said, it's apt.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.989
Thank you, Berta.
You're a very insightful woman.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.232
I know. In a just world,
you'd be washing my shorts.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.874
Well, thanks, nevertheless.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.998
Last chance to see those tattoos.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.033
No thanks.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.476
I can make the Road Runner
do jumping jacks.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.389
That was a fun apology.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.510
Yeah, I really thought
I was the one who deserved a spanking.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.834
- So you'll call me?
- Count on it.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.997
Hey, not that I really care, but,
do you happen to know...

15:23.200 --> 15:24.918
...who started that silly website?

15:25.080 --> 15:26.991
No. I just found it
by Googling your name.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.720
Most women Google
the guys they go out with, you know.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.711
Yeah, I've heard.

15:32.600 --> 15:36.070
- Well, I'll see you soon.
- You better.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.799
Okay. That went well.

15:43.840 --> 15:47.150
Let's see. Who's next?

16:34.680 --> 16:37.672
Jake, why don't you go watch
some TV. I need to talk to your dad.

16:37.840 --> 16:41.196
Is this about the firecrackers?
What firecrackers?

16:41.360 --> 16:44.318
I'll go watch TV.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.399
Come in, sit down.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.869
Thanks. Listen...

16:50.600 --> 16:53.239
- Boy, this is tough.
- Okay, okay, maybe...

16:53.400 --> 16:55.755
...I can make it easier for you.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.399
Judith...

16:57.960 --> 17:00.030
...I will always love you...

17:01.720 --> 17:03.676
...but there's no going back for me.

17:03.840 --> 17:07.116
I've learned a lot about myself
in the last year, and I'm growing.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.794
And... And I wanna keep on growing.

17:11.119 --> 17:14.556
I will always cherish
what we had...

17:15.359 --> 17:17.351
...but I have to fertilize my shrub.

17:19.680 --> 17:22.398
- What are you talking about?
- It's Berta's metaphor.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.996
The... The bottom line is:
I don't want to reconcile.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.832
Our marriage is over.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.275
Well, what makes you think
I wanna reconcile?

17:31.080 --> 17:33.036
What did you wanna talk to me about?

17:33.680 --> 17:36.592
My mom wanted me to ask
if Jake could spend a couple of weeks...

17:36.760 --> 17:38.512
...with them this summer.
- Oh, really?

17:38.680 --> 17:41.240
- That's what she wanted you to ask me?
- Yes.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.829
You didn't tell her you loved me,
you missed me?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.434
Well, I always tell her that
to shut her up.

17:47.760 --> 17:50.672
And how the hell do you know
what I talk to my mother about?

17:53.480 --> 17:56.358
Hey, look, Charlie's here.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.838
- Answer my question, Alan.
- Hold on a second, Judith.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.788
- Charlie, what's wrong?
- I've been making amends.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.470
Five amends in one afternoon.

18:12.640 --> 18:16.838
Well, technically, four.
I had to fake the last one.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.188
- Charlie, Alan and I are talking.
- Don't worry.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.999
I'll be out of your way as soon
as I check on something.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.878
They all denied
running the website...

18:26.040 --> 18:29.157
...but at least I should have
some good reviews now.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.514
Listen to this:

18:31.680 --> 18:35.116
"Charlie came over and apologized today,
and, oh, what an apology it was.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.669
I take back everything nasty
I ever said about him."

18:37.840 --> 18:39.592
Not bad, huh?

18:40.520 --> 18:41.669
Here's another one:

18:45.360 --> 18:46.759
"He apologized to you today?

18:46.920 --> 18:49.718
He apologized to me too."

18:49.880 --> 18:53.111
Okay, I have a bad feeling again.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.396
Alan, how do you know what
I said to my mother?

18:57.640 --> 19:01.030
I didn't actually know.
I surmised.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.792
I should go talk to Charlie.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.077
Hey, Dad, check it out.
I can see my room on your computer.

19:08.600 --> 19:12.229
Okay, now I've got a bad feeling.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.275
My heart was in the right place, Rose.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.034
- I know.
- All I wanted to do was apologize.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.760
- I had no ulterior motives.
- I believe you.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.512
Thank you.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.714
Did I ever apologize to you?

19:29.680 --> 19:33.753
You mean, for our one-night stand
that kind of, sort of broke my heart?

19:35.360 --> 19:36.634
Yeah, for that.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.393
No, not really.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.757
Okay, well, I am truly sorry.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.354
You're a wonderful person,
and you deserved better.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.837
Thank you, Charlie.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.673
- That's sweet.
- I mean it.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.957
- What's that?
- Oh, this?

20:00.120 --> 20:04.033
It's one of those new
web browser, e-mail gadgets.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.151
Cool.
