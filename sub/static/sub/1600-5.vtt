NARRATOR:
Previously on Bates Motel...

00:04.600 --> 00:06.523
You're new.
What's your name?

00:07.200 --> 00:08.486
Norman Bates.

00:08.560 --> 00:09.561
Bradley Martin.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.483
You have any questions
at school, you call me.

00:11.560 --> 00:14.450
So, the other night, Why'd you
leave the party so early?

00:16.320 --> 00:18.800
That's my dad's car.
(TIRES SCREECHING)

00:18.880 --> 00:19.927
Dad!

00:21.040 --> 00:22.280
(SOBBING)

00:23.280 --> 00:24.520
Oh, my...

00:25.040 --> 00:27.691
BRADLEY: <i>It's like someone's
with you your whole life,</i>

00:27.760 --> 00:29.728
<i>and then
they're just gone.</i>

00:30.600 --> 00:32.442
<i>Do you want to go
to my room?</i>

00:33.320 --> 00:35.243
<i>You just want
to be happy.</i>

00:36.200 --> 00:38.407
<i>I like being
with you, Norman.</i>

00:38.960 --> 00:40.291
I love you, Norman.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.884
You're the best thing that
has ever happened to me.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.530
I love you too, Mom.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.090
NORMA: Norman?

00:48.960 --> 00:50.121
NORMAN:
<i>I kept Keith's belt.</i>

00:50.200 --> 00:51.929
Why would you
do that, Norman?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.810
I was sexually assaulted,
and I killed a man.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.723
<i>Why would you ever,
ever in a million years,</i>

00:56.800 --> 00:58.643
why would you want to
keep a memento of that?

01:00.480 --> 01:03.723
Romero never saw the belt.
I found it. I took it.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.325
So no one else knows.

01:05.400 --> 01:08.802
So don't you worry, okay?
Everything is going to be fine.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.080
Norma Louise Bates,
you're under arrest

01:12.160 --> 01:14.162
for the murder of
Keith Summers.

(CHUCKLES) Uh, hey.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.681
Hey-

02:47.000 --> 02:48.411
Uh, Mom asleep?

02:50.760 --> 02:52.250
She's in jail.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.371
How are you?

03:18.080 --> 03:19.366
I've been better.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.561
(SNICKERS)

03:20.640 --> 03:22.927
What can we do?
How do we help?

03:26.760 --> 03:30.367
I'm glad you want to help, Norman.
Really, it's big of you.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.570
Any mother would be broken
in half by such devotion.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.882
Your bail is set
at $100,000.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.328
You got that
laying around?

03:42.120 --> 03:43.167
No?

03:43.840 --> 03:45.569
No, I didn't think so.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.209
Look, we can use the
motel as collateral.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.884
You know what? Just...
Just leave me here.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.843
And get the hell out of here,
both of you, seriously.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.803
I don't need your help.
This is all a big mistake.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.161
It's just gonna clear itself up.
(SNIFFLES)

03:56.480 --> 03:58.323
Really?
NORMA: Mmm-hmm.

03:58.520 --> 04:02.002
Given everything that happened,
you don't need any help?

04:12.360 --> 04:13.521
Yeah.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.086
Now get out
of here.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.640
You got no one else to help...
Get out of here!

04:30.480 --> 04:31.527
Mom, I want
to help you.

04:36.520 --> 04:37.681
Please.

05:32.280 --> 05:33.281
(RINGS BELL)

05:34.560 --> 05:35.800
Oh, Emma.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.731
You're better.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.601
What?

05:43.840 --> 05:45.729
I heard about
your mom.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.284
That she was arrested and charged
with the murder of Keith Summers.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.241
How did you
hear already?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.124
Big news in a small
town, Norman.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.128
Anyway, I'm... I am sorry.
I mean, um,

05:58.440 --> 06:01.205
I'm just sorry because...

06:04.600 --> 06:05.681
Damn, that's gotta suck.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.325
Yep, it sucks.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.447
You're welcome to
come stay with us.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.203
Well, thank you, um,

06:17.280 --> 06:19.726
but I've got my brother, you know,
Dylan, and we should, um...

06:19.800 --> 06:22.849
Your brother, right, yeah.
I forgot about that.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.046
Found it.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.167
Found what?

06:30.480 --> 06:32.323
The deed
to the motel.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.843
I can, uh, I can go get
bail money for my mom now.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.681
You want me to take you? Okay.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.481
Thanks.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.206
DYLAN: Hey, so these
guys we work for,

06:48.440 --> 06:50.761
think they'd give
me an advance?

06:52.800 --> 06:54.040
How much?

06:55.120 --> 06:56.451
I don't know.
Maybe...

06:56.560 --> 06:58.164
$5,000?
(LAUGHING)

06:59.680 --> 07:01.523
Oh, buddy.
Never mind.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.682
They just don't exactly have
a credit union, you know?

07:04.280 --> 07:05.247
And they barely
know you.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.682
Besides, I've seen what they do
to people who owe them money.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.930
Yeah, it's just...

07:12.600 --> 07:14.682
I don't know. I think maybe
I need to get my own place.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.121
You know?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.680
Someplace good for me
and my brother to live.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.610
For... Forget it, I'll figure
it out, man. It's cool.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.644
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

07:46.920 --> 07:48.206
I'm not hungry.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.530
You should really
eat something.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.881
I don't care about
food right now.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.321
Thank you
for taking me, Emma.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.450
You're a good friend.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.727
Well, if you can't count
on your friends to help

08:37.799 --> 08:40.371
bail your mother out of
prison, then really,

08:40.440 --> 08:42.169
what good are they?

08:44.120 --> 08:45.167
So, Jonn's not here.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.645
I'll wait with you.

08:53.440 --> 08:54.441
So, you...

08:57.440 --> 09:00.250
So you know the girl from
the manga book, right?

09:00.320 --> 09:01.321
Of course.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.570
I found her.

09:04.640 --> 09:05.607
What?

09:05.680 --> 09:06.681
Yeah, I know.

09:08.040 --> 09:11.010
This is gonna sound so weird, and
I can't explain it all to you.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.206
You're just gonna have
to accept that, okay?

09:12.320 --> 09:14.482
You can't start asking a
whole bunch of questions.

09:14.560 --> 09:15.561
Okay-

09:18.440 --> 09:20.329
She was being held prisoner
in this guy's basement.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.885
Oh, my God. What guy?
He's a cop.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.485
He's a cop?
Yeah, a cop.

09:23.560 --> 09:24.891
Oh, my God.
The cops are in on it.

09:25.000 --> 09:25.967
Don't start freaking out...

09:26.040 --> 09:27.405
I'm not freaking out.
This is a police conspiracy.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.289
No, we don't know that
it's a police conspiracy.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.203
For all I know, it's just
this one cop, Deputy Shelby.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.361
We have to go
to the authorities.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.249
We're not going to the authorities.
My mom's in jail.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.606
But, Norman,
we have to!

09:35.720 --> 09:37.848
I can't bring more
crap down on her.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.810
How did you find her?
I can't answer that.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.843
Of course you can. Emma,
I told you I couldn't.

09:42.800 --> 09:43.801
All right.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.685
We have to
go get her.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.000
She's gone.
How do you know?

09:48.080 --> 09:49.206
Just stop asking questions!

09:49.280 --> 09:51.044
You can't expect me
to not ask questions,

09:51.120 --> 09:52.929
especially if you're not
explaining the situation.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.490
I should never have said anything.
You're freaking out.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.000
I'm not freaking out. You're
freaking out all over Italy.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.602
I'm sorry, Emma. I just knew
it was so important to you.

10:02.680 --> 10:06.287
I want to do something about it. I
just can't until I deal with my mom.

10:08.680 --> 10:09.681
Please, Emma.

10:09.920 --> 10:13.811
We will help the girl. I just
have to make sure my mom is safe.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.008
Okay, Norman.
I get it.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.086
Hi.
How are you?

10:28.560 --> 10:29.561
You want me to
go in with you?

10:29.640 --> 10:32.928
No, I'd rather just, uh...
But thanks for bringing me.

10:33.240 --> 10:34.321
No problem.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.165
Oh, and Norman?

10:37.320 --> 10:38.560
Did she do it?

10:39.520 --> 10:42.603
I wouldn't blame her.
Keith Summers was a pig.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.810
No, she didn't.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.450
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

11:56.520 --> 11:58.887
I brought you flowers.
That's nice.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.651
Got cab money. You use it.
I'm walking.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.842
Mom, come on. Don't you
"Mom, come on" me.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.122
I have nothing
to say to you.

12:28.680 --> 12:29.920
Mother, when are you
gonna look at me?

12:38.640 --> 12:39.607
Mrs. Bates?

12:39.680 --> 12:41.762
If you follow me, Ms. Craig
will see you now.

12:41.840 --> 12:42.841
Thank you.

12:45.440 --> 12:47.124
So, Keith Summers.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.291
Everyone knew he was unhappy
you bought the motel.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.521
I suppose.

12:51.600 --> 12:55.002
So, it's not unreasonable to assume
he was intent on harassing you.

12:55.640 --> 12:59.361
Which would explain why his truck
was parked near your property.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.727
If you don't mind
me asking, um,

13:03.080 --> 13:04.605
how old are you
exactly?

13:04.720 --> 13:05.721
I'm 33.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.169
So, Keith Summers
was probably

13:09.240 --> 13:12.289
trying to sabotage your
efforts to reopen the motel,

13:12.360 --> 13:16.160
trying to inhibit your ability to turn
his failure into a successful business.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.730
Excuse me,
what are you doing?

13:18.160 --> 13:20.447
It's like this thing right now,
this thing that you're doing.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.569
It sounds like you're
trying to make up a story.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.448
You are charged
with murder.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.930
I'm talking to you
about your defense.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.651
I don't need a defense.
I didn't do it.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.245
Norma.
Mmm?

13:35.400 --> 13:38.244
The prosecution is going
to have a carpet fiber

13:38.320 --> 13:41.210
that matches the carpeting you
were pulling up in your motel

13:41.280 --> 13:43.089
the night Keith
Summers disappeared.

13:43.600 --> 13:47.127
That same fiber was found under
the band of Keith Summers' watch.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.602
I mean, why does everyone
find it so incriminating

13:50.680 --> 13:52.808
that there was carpet
fiber under his watch?

13:52.920 --> 13:54.809
The man owned the motel for 40 years.
Mom...

13:54.920 --> 13:56.365
Why isn't anybody thinking about that?
Morn, just, Morn...

13:56.480 --> 13:57.481
Stay out of this, Norman.

13:57.560 --> 14:00.131
You know, it's like everybody all
of a sudden has just got together

14:00.200 --> 14:01.884
and decided that
I am guilty.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.050
It's hard to refute
DNA evidence.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.645
I don't care.
According to whom?

14:05.720 --> 14:07.688
Who's running these tests?
I want to run my own tests.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.524
Norma... Rebecca,
I didn't do it.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.409
Okay, I'm not going to
walk into a court of law

14:11.480 --> 14:13.448
and say that I did
it in self-defense

14:13.520 --> 14:15.761
just to make your job easier.
I didn't do it!

14:17.200 --> 14:18.201
I'm done here.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.248
I guess we're... I
guess we're leaving.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.126
You're being
unreasonable, Mom.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.244
You're lying.
Don't start, Norman.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.085
I have to say it. You're not
doing anything to help yourself.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.207
They have evidence
against you.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.243
What difference does it
make to you, anyway?

14:47.320 --> 14:48.924
What are you talking about, what
difference does it make to me?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.968
You do not
care about me.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.922
You went out
and you got laid

14:54.000 --> 14:57.288
that night that I was crying
in my room worried sick

14:57.360 --> 14:59.567
about all of this, about
what could happen,

14:59.640 --> 15:03.087
about me being taken away
from you and put in jail,

15:03.160 --> 15:05.288
you went out,
and you got laid!

15:08.200 --> 15:10.248
(STAMMERING)
Mom, I'm jus...

15:10.800 --> 15:12.131
I'm sorry.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.165
It just happened, you know? She
texted me and Dylan said I should go.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.163
Oh, there's a surprise.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.681
Who was it?

15:21.680 --> 15:22.727
Mother.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.406
Fine, don't tell me. I
don't want to know anyway.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.931
This is all Dylan's fault.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.764
Don't blame him, Mom.
He's just worried about me!

15:29.840 --> 15:31.126
He's just trying to
turn you against me!

15:31.240 --> 15:32.287
No one could do that!

15:32.360 --> 15:33.566
Really?

15:39.160 --> 15:41.367
You told him
our personal business.

15:42.920 --> 15:46.641
You told him what happened. How
could you do that to me, Norman?

15:50.640 --> 15:52.529
'Cause you do things that
don't make sense, Mom.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.367
You scare me.
I'm scared, okay?

16:00.480 --> 16:02.323
I think you might
need help.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.051
I scare you?

16:10.520 --> 16:11.521
(SIGHS)

16:11.600 --> 16:16.003
There's something every mother dreams
their children will tell them one day.

16:16.120 --> 16:20.648

to give you a decent life.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.041
Get out of my car! I didn't mean it that way.
Just listen...

16:23.120 --> 16:24.610
I don't care!
Get out of my car!

16:24.680 --> 16:25.806
It's like 10 miles
to our house.

16:25.920 --> 16:29.003
If I'm so damn scary, get
the hell out of my car!

16:34.120 --> 16:37.090

doing out here?

17:35.320 --> 17:36.890
Mom kicked me
out of the car.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.485
Way out here?

17:40.880 --> 17:41.961

17:45.080 --> 17:46.081
Hop on.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.121
Ready?

18:42.600 --> 18:44.409
Why'd you get
out of the car?

18:44.560 --> 18:45.800
She said, "Get out."

18:45.880 --> 18:49.566
Yeah, well, that's her thing.
She makes a big fuss,

18:49.960 --> 18:53.407
so then you will be like, "Oh, don't
worry, Mother. It'll all be fine."

18:54.160 --> 18:56.891
She's going through a lot. Yeah,
she's always going through a lot.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.243
It's not gonna change.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.565
She lives for the drama.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.688
She's like
an addict, Norman.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.091
And when you have
an addict in your life,

19:07.160 --> 19:10.562
the best thing you can do for them,
and for yourself, is walk away.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.842
That might have worked for
you, Dylan, but not for me.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.048

away from your parents.

19:39.520 --> 19:40.681
I'm getting
my own place.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.120
Where?

19:45.840 --> 19:47.524
Down by the beach.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.044
It's an ocean view.

19:50.760 --> 19:53.240
And if she goes to jail,
you're moving in with me.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.285
And if she doesn't,

19:58.360 --> 20:00.727
well, I still think that you
should move in with me.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.442

at some time, right?

20:08.880 --> 20:11.724
She can't get through
this. Not without me.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.291
She's my mom, Dylan.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.885
Yeah, well,

20:17.880 --> 20:19.564

20:20.840 --> 20:23.684
that's not really much
of a reason to stay.

Hey, how much do you think
places around here go for?

20:43.280 --> 20:47.001
It depends. I found a cool place
for, like, 22 hunny a month.

20:48.400 --> 20:51.768
Oh, I got some food at that
bagel store by Bayview.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.569

be hungry.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.641

21:07.440 --> 21:08.441
Um...

21:10.680 --> 21:12.444
What did you do,
rob the bagel place?

21:12.520 --> 21:14.648
No, I just
threw it in there.

21:14.720 --> 21:18.281
It's for you. So you can get
that place for you and your bro.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.042
I... l thought the bosses
didn't give advances.

21:26.120 --> 21:29.602
Oh, they don't. It's my money,
but I know you're good for it.

Five grand.

you'll pay me back.

It just seems rude to
just launch into... Emma.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.443
The girl.
Okay.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.364
So, I was trying to figure out where
this cop might have hid the girl

33:36.440 --> 33:38.568
If she isn't in
his basement anymore.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.689

33:40.760 --> 33:42.762
"If I had
an Asian sex slave,

33:42.840 --> 33:44.729
"where would I hide her?"

33:44.800 --> 33:47.007
So I'm thinking, does this
guy own a cabin somewhere?

33:47.080 --> 33:49.048
A lake house? Any other
family property?

33:49.120 --> 33:50.485
But I googled that and
came up with nothing.

33:51.600 --> 33:55.241
So then I start wondering, if
this cop had one of these girls,

33:55.840 --> 33:59.128
then he probably knew about the business
that was being run out of the motel.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.567

the journal, you know?

34:01.640 --> 34:02.721

34:02.800 --> 34:06.805
maybe this cop was in the business with Keith
Summers and now Keith Summers is dead.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.050
Are you okay?

34:10.120 --> 34:13.841

to tell you this.

with Bradley now.

anything, you know?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.411

34:40.480 --> 34:41.844
It means you hooked up.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.251
You can make it sound
like that, but...

34:43.320 --> 34:44.400
Because that's what it was.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.289
It... it was a hookup.

34:46.719 --> 34:49.087
Yeah, well,
or maybe it was more.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.524

relationship status?

34:54.520 --> 34:55.760

googling something?

35:06.720 --> 35:09.371

property or something?

If you were in an illegal business
with someone and that person died,

35:14.440 --> 35:18.206
might you not use their property
to hide something or someone?

35:19.840 --> 35:21.888
Keith Summers
owned a boat.

for breaking and entering.

35:39.240 --> 35:40.526
Slip 815.

35:40.960 --> 35:43.042
There it is.
The Seafarer.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.446
Thanks.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.161
That'll work.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.009
(FLOORBOARDS CREAKING)

37:16.640 --> 37:17.926
What now?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.162
I don't know.
Look around.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.285
(SCREAMING)
EMMA: Oh, my God!

37:37.920 --> 37:40.446
Oh, my God, she's here. She's
actually here. Get me out!

37:40.520 --> 37:42.204
Get me out!
Hey.

37:42.360 --> 37:45.204
Hey! I kill you! Get me out!

37:46.320 --> 37:48.800
It's okay. What happens
in your plan now?

37:48.880 --> 37:50.848
Let's just get
her out of here.

38:22.120 --> 38:25.044
God, she's passed out again.
Can you help me?

38:51.320 --> 38:53.482
Come on. Up here.
(INDISTINCT MUTTERING)

38:57.960 --> 38:59.849
Well, we should
clean her up a little.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.570
She's got vomit
in her hair.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.085
I'll go get a wet towel.

39:05.680 --> 39:07.091
Oh, great.

39:42.800 --> 39:43.961
Norman?

39:44.560 --> 39:47.291
Norman, what is going on?
Why is this girl here?

39:49.360 --> 39:52.364
Mom, maybe you should
just sit down for a sec.

39:54.480 --> 39:55.811
Does she know?
Do I know what?

39:55.880 --> 39:57.086
Mom, please,
just sit down.

39:57.160 --> 39:58.650
No, I don't want to sit down.
I want to know what

39:58.720 --> 40:00.245
the three of you are
doing in our motel room,

40:00.320 --> 40:03.164
'cause right now
it doesn't look too good.

40:05.160 --> 40:06.286
This is the girl.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.370
What girl? The girl I told you about.
The girl from the basement.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.242
Norman, stop it.
You're making this up.

40:18.320 --> 40:21.244
I told you, I went downstairs.
There was nobody in the basement.

40:21.360 --> 40:24.603
There was nobody there. Mom,
open your eyes about that guy.

40:24.680 --> 40:27.001
This is her.
Ask her.

40:30.680 --> 40:34.241
Tell her. Tell her you were
locked in that cop's basement.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.125
He keep me...

40:38.480 --> 40:40.289
He keep me
in his house.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.725
He make me
have a sex.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.167
That's not true.
That's not true.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.041
Okay-

40:56.880 --> 41:00.407
I'm sorry, dear, I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm just saying that

41:00.880 --> 41:02.689
there must be
some mistake.

41:02.760 --> 41:05.570
It can't be the same man. It's
not the same man. It's not Zack.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.250
Hold on, hold on.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.682
This is not the man, right?

41:45.280 --> 41:46.725
(WHIMPERING)

41:50.520 --> 41:51.567
He is the man.

41:53.400 --> 41:54.925
He is the man.

42:00.920 --> 42:01.921
I'm sorry.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.167
I'm sorry.

42:09.760 --> 42:10.886
I told you.
