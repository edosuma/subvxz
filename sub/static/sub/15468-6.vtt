00:13.639 --> 00:16.475
Yeah, rise and shine, Napoleon.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.978
Boo, drop a record, loud!

00:21.939 --> 00:23.148
You a gang dude, right?

00:23.232 --> 00:25.275
So you know what an Apache line is.

00:25.359 --> 00:29.112
They beat you for a whole song
to jump you in. Right?

00:29.196 --> 00:31.281
Then we handing you over to my man, Wolf.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.284
Boo, drop that record,
come over here and smack his ass.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.202
Get your ass up.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.164
Come on.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.041
Smack his ass.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.752
Smack him, Boo. Come on.

00:43.835 --> 00:44.920
You got it. Come on.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.149
All right, all right. Stop.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.776
Smack him, Boo. Come on. Come on.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.028
- Not this song.
- I can't hit him like that.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.364
- This song...
- Hey, look, this ain't right.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.074
He loves this song.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.743
What the fuck are you crying about?

01:17.452 --> 01:19.871
Hey. Why you crying, motherfucker?

01:19.955 --> 01:21.790
Please. No more.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.083
We ain't even get started yet.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.793
- I can't.
- You supposed to be hard.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.045
Stop crying!

01:28.297 --> 01:30.048
-Th-- They--
-They who?

01:30.132 --> 01:34.261
I know stuff. I know it,
and that's why he killed my brothers.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.972
Stop sniveling, motherfucker!
Pull yourself together.

01:37.055 --> 01:40.225
Tell me, who the fuck is he,
and what the fuck do you know?

01:40.976 --> 01:43.395
I know he... he set up Fat Annie.

01:43.478 --> 01:47.024
He paid the Warlords to do it.
Please, I don't wanna die.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.819
- I don't want him to kill me.
- Yo, who is he?

01:50.902 --> 01:51.737
No, I don't know.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.948
He smokes cigars
and he drives a Buick. Red.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.243
And he always played this song.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.581

And, boy, is it lucrative.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.584
With four billion dollars in sales,

03:29.668 --> 03:31.420
<i>'77 is shaping up to be</i>
<i>the record industry's</i>

03:31.503 --> 03:33.004
<i>most profitable year ever.</i>

03:33.463 --> 03:35.048
<i>So, how is a disco hit made?</i>

03:35.298 --> 03:38.051
<i>With its lavish productions</i>
<i>of strings and brass,</i>

03:38.135 --> 03:40.971
<i>most picture a band of musicians</i>
<i>playing together in a studio.</i>

03:41.555 --> 03:42.389
<i>Not so with disco.</i>

03:43.181 --> 03:45.016
<i>Instead the producer, composer</i>
<i>and arranger</i>

03:45.100 --> 03:48.979
<i>mix 24 individually recorded</i>
<i>vocal and instrumental tracks</i>

03:49.062 --> 03:51.982
<i>to create the symphonic experience</i>
<i>that dancers know and love.</i>

03:53.191 --> 03:54.901
<i>This multitracking technique is not new.</i>

03:55.569 --> 03:58.697
<i>What's new is that almost all</i>
<i>dance records are now made this way.</i>

03:58.822 --> 04:00.741
<i>- But that's only step number one.</i>

04:02.284 --> 04:05.829
Step two, ladies, is getting
the big-time club DJs to spin the record.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.914
-I'm so nervous.
-Don't be.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.250
Look, number one,
your song's a guaranteed hit.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.754
Number two, when it comes
to the business of doing business,

04:13.837 --> 04:15.505
Jackie Moreno has no peer.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.966
All right? I'm a hit maker,
that's what I do.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.218
<i>♪ You're gonna be a star... ♪</i>

04:20.719 --> 04:22.637
Is the record pool this way?

04:23.555 --> 04:24.473
Love the shoes.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.641
<i>When a disco producer finishes a track,</i>

04:26.725 --> 04:29.394
<i>he'll invite prominent club DJs</i>
<i>to give input.</i>

04:29.603 --> 04:32.189
<i>If a DJ likes a track,</i>
<i>he might play it in his club.</i>

04:32.272 --> 04:35.484
<i>But remember,</i>
<i>the DJ's own reputation is at stake.</i>

04:35.567 --> 04:38.653
<i>And believe me, the serious</i>
<i>hitmakers care about their rep.</i>

04:38.737 --> 04:40.363
<i>But they don't got time to listen</i>

04:40.447 --> 04:42.157
to every new disco track.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.618
That's why Leslie started the record pool.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.788
She listens and then once a week
the DJs gather at the pool,

04:47.871 --> 04:50.957
they hear her crème de la crème,
'cause she's got the taste.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.710
And these guys make the hits,
not the radio, not the record company.

04:54.169 --> 04:57.130
<i>And one woman, Leslie Lesgold,</i>
<i>controls it all.</i>

04:57.798 --> 05:01.343
-I appreciate you seeing me, Miss Lesgold.
-Jackie Moreno.

05:01.426 --> 05:04.721
Mylene Cruz's record is dynamite.
Right?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.056
Long time no see.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.725
My apologies.
That's-- Have we met?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.977
I sucked your dick
in the back of Maxwell's Plum.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.395
Really?

05:12.813 --> 05:14.898
Um... small world.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.484
...two ships passing in the night?

05:17.692 --> 05:20.362
-I was your intern at La Lupe Records.
-No.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.072
I-- I would remember that.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.616
Marion Schwartz? From Scarsdale.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.201
Marion.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.870
Marion, Marion.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.206
Wow, hi.
Hey, what a happy coincidence.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.333
Happy for me, not for you.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.378
-May I just say--
-Go fuck yourself.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.547
With that little bent dick you got.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.174
Bent little dick.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.023
<i>Bonsoir</i> Ezekiel, I'm Claudia.

05:57.190 --> 06:01.027
-I'm... Ezekiel.
-Don't you just hate flowers?

06:05.740 --> 06:07.033
<i>Entrez, s'il vous plaît.</i>

06:07.701 --> 06:08.660
<i>merci.</i>

06:08.743 --> 06:11.454
May I take your exterior vestments?
You must be hot.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.040
It's no trouble, really.
I'll just keep it.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.293
Well, suit yourself.

06:19.838 --> 06:23.842
Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Orwell.
Even Salinger.

06:24.342 --> 06:27.178
Prophet of our teenage angst.
First editions, you know.

06:27.429 --> 06:31.057
All my first editions are due at
South Bronx Library by lunch on Thursday.

<i>- ♪ I'm here and I'll be waiting... ♪</i>

06:34.769 --> 06:36.563
I'm sorry, are you Carlo Pakoussa?

06:36.646 --> 06:39.065
-Yeah.
-I love you, you're amazing.

06:39.149 --> 06:42.527
Your mix to Misty Holloway "Far Far Away,"
it's my favorite ever.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.863
Thanks. Yeah, I'm proud of that one, too.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.615
- I'm Mylene Cruz.
- Hey.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.034
Leslie Lesgold's listening
to our record right now.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.036
Maybe you could listen to it, too.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.288
If she says it's cool,
I'll do more than just listen.

06:53.872 --> 06:57.584
Listen, I'm not gonna bullshit you.
I regret that we got involved sexually.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.295
-You fucked me and fired me.
-Technically, yes.

07:00.879 --> 07:05.967
But let's be honest. I fired you
because you were a terrible intern.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.386
-I was young.
-Your youth notwithstanding,

07:08.470 --> 07:09.721
you were unstable.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.264
You were surly, you stole.

07:11.348 --> 07:14.601
-Everybody stole.
-You stole from me. You stole my watch.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.561
-You st-- An ounce of blow.
-I was hurt.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.064
Let's not quibble. Did you, um...

07:20.148 --> 07:22.776
-Did you listen to Mylene's record?
-It's a very good record.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.277
My DJs would love it.

07:24.861 --> 07:28.448
-I'm relieved to hear you say that.
-I'm not gonna make it available to them.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.408
And without them and without me...

07:31.576 --> 07:34.287
-your record goes nowhere.
-Nowhere.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.542
So, how do you know Francisco?

07:39.626 --> 07:40.752
His, um...

07:41.795 --> 07:44.506
- His niece and I grew up together.
- Is she cute?

07:45.173 --> 07:47.550
- Claudia.
- What? I'm just asking.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.802
-What's her name?
-Mylene.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.345
<i>Vous l'aimez, cette belle Mylene ?</i>

07:50.428 --> 07:52.555
Don't feel compelled to answer, Ezekiel.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.892
Claudia enjoys the, shock value
of her little quips.

07:55.976 --> 07:56.977
You into punk?

07:57.560 --> 08:00.814
-I'm not sure what that is, to be honest.
-You never heard of the Ramones?

08:00.897 --> 08:02.399
You don't know "I Wanna Be Sedated"?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.901
Try your vichyssoise.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.028
It's divine.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.363
It's pretentious.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.281
- Claudia.
- Oops.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.576
Okay, you got me. You win. Touché.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.330
What do you want me to do?

08:20.458 --> 08:21.835
I'm gonna exploit you...

08:23.003 --> 08:24.129
like you exploited me.

08:24.713 --> 08:28.174
I'm gonna abuse my power
like you abused yours.

08:28.258 --> 08:32.761
And if you're compliant, then...
we'll see.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.179
You up for this, Tiny?

08:34.264 --> 08:35.724
Good, lock the door.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.231
To estimate the intelligence of a leader,

08:43.313 --> 08:46.484
look at the men he keeps around him.
You have to consider that.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.069
In what sense, sir?

08:48.737 --> 08:51.573
Are you a man willing to make
tough decisions to get what you want?

08:52.907 --> 08:54.325
-I think so.
-Me, too.

08:56.953 --> 09:00.248
You had the intestinal fortitude
to come to my office,

09:00.331 --> 09:03.543
to tell me you weren't gonna kiss my ass
to earn your internship back.

09:05.086 --> 09:08.923
That was a tough decision to make.
It got you here, in my home.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.843
It got you what you wanted.

09:14.054 --> 09:14.929
Thank you.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.641
-You like my home?
-Yes, sir.

09:20.226 --> 09:23.813
I'm thinking about putting a piano
in the front room.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.776
What do you think?
Steinway, Bösendorfer, Mason & Hamlin?

09:27.859 --> 09:29.652
Bechstein. Bechstein's the best.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.655
-How do you know?
-My mother, she liked pianos.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.034
But Bechsteins cost lots of money.
Thousands of dollars.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.952
What if I told you I owned four of them?

09:40.371 --> 09:41.581
Know what I did to get them?

09:43.124 --> 09:45.627
Worked hard and pulled yourself up
by your bootstraps?

09:48.088 --> 09:48.922
Not quite.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.467
This morning, I voted to increase
the cost of a subway token.

09:53.343 --> 09:56.429
And then I endorsed a plan
to close a hospital, near you.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.432
And I blocked the teachers' union
from getting a raise.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.268
And that was before lunch.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.938
You see, leaders make sacrifices.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.524
We are vigilant about the company we keep.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.776
If someone holds us back,
we leave them behind.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.613
-You make difficult decisions.
-Exactly.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.282
Aw, shit. All right, Wolf,
who you take in a fight?

10:16.366 --> 10:18.910
- Bruce Lee or Jim Brown?
- Shao, baby,

10:18.993 --> 10:22.914
put on Wolf's favorite record.
It's time to share the big news.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.126
Bruce Lee all day, man.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.878
You seen <i> Fists of Fury?</i>
Mr. Lee is lethal as hell.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.631
Motherfucker, come on.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.341
Bruce Lee ain't shit.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.803
Jim Brown could pulverize
his little narrow egg-roll ass.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.221
He fast though.

10:38.304 --> 10:42.267
He fast 'cause they speed up that camera
over there in Hong Kong.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.602
They sneaky like that over there,
right, Slim?

10:44.686 --> 10:46.646
That's my song. Yes, sir.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.556

Uncle Wolf here is the one
who tried to kill me.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.612
He broke my heart.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.655
Yes, you did.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.199
-Warlords working for him.
-Tell me that shit ain't true.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.327
Ain't this family been good to you?

11:42.410 --> 11:44.078
-And I was trying to save it.
-Save it?

11:44.162 --> 11:45.622
She's trying to go after Nicky Barnes.

11:45.747 --> 11:49.918
Ask her. You don't have to be a genius
to know that's suicide.

11:50.001 --> 11:52.503
You go after Mr. Untouchable
and you gonna get touched.

11:52.587 --> 11:56.341
-Nicky's a weak nigga just like you.
-Let me finish him, Mama.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.344
No. Shaolin took the initiative...

12:00.178 --> 12:02.722
so he's gonna do the honors.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.475
Could you leave your best friend behind?

12:05.558 --> 12:07.226
Could you take that initiative

12:07.310 --> 12:11.189
to advance yourself and your city
before New York is left to the roaches?

12:11.272 --> 12:13.650
Are you following me?

12:15.610 --> 12:16.611
I think so.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.529
Because if you say yes...

12:20.031 --> 12:21.366
you will be empowered.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.242
And with that power,

12:23.326 --> 12:26.537
you can return to your friends and family
in the Bronx as a leader.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.916
Free of poverty,
free of filth and squalor.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.126
But you have to free yourself first.

12:34.545 --> 12:37.382
You see, it's the friendships we break

12:37.465 --> 12:39.968
more so than the friendships we make

12:40.051 --> 12:42.470
that delineate the intelligent leader.

12:43.346 --> 12:47.058
I've got the power now, Jackie.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.685
Open up.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.311
Open.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.740
Take that in your hand.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.493
Feel the power in that.

13:06.202 --> 13:09.247
The power to take a man's life.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.084
Power can restore justice...

13:13.876 --> 13:15.003
right wrongs...

13:15.670 --> 13:17.213
lift whole communities.

13:17.839 --> 13:24.012
I want you to taste exactly
what it's like to be powerless.

13:24.554 --> 13:28.891
You have the power to stay quiet
or the power to tell.

13:29.392 --> 13:33.354
Power can change people's lives,
improve them.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.065
You have the power over this man's life.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.775
You chose to kill him.

13:38.067 --> 13:42.321
<i>If you excel</i>
<i>in this internship, college awaits.</i>

13:42.655 --> 13:47.160
<i>But the road to power will take you away</i>
<i>from all you hold dear.</i>

13:47.243 --> 13:50.455
So, kill him. Use it. Use your power.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.165
Feel it.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.292
And when you return to the Bronx,

13:54.375 --> 13:57.795
the friends and family
that you left behind...

13:57.879 --> 14:00.506
<i>- ...will look you in the eye...</i>

14:01.007 --> 14:04.052
Don't hide behind Annie no more.

14:04.135 --> 14:06.095
...and say to you, "Ezekiel..."

14:06.721 --> 14:08.931
-Count to three.
-"...you're not the same."

14:09.015 --> 14:10.391
<i>Quiet and slow.</i>

14:10.516 --> 14:13.061
- "<i>You're changing</i>."
- Take three breaths.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.354
"You're not one of us anymore."

14:15.438 --> 14:17.356
-Don't let her run you.
-And on the third one...

14:17.440 --> 14:19.150
-Make her do it.
-...pull the trigger.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.570
<i>Be bold.</i>

14:22.653 --> 14:25.114
"<i>Your heart's turned cold."</i>

14:25.198 --> 14:28.701
She might've got your manhood,
but don't let her steal your soul.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.788
<i>- Can you handle that sort of road?</i>

14:34.540 --> 14:35.792
I can handle it, Mr. Gunns.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.217
Real good.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.845
Just like I knew you would.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.394
I want the power to change things.
I want the internship, Mr. Gunns.

14:54.477 --> 14:57.605
Next Saturday your friend Francisco
is hosting a campaign event

14:57.688 --> 14:59.857
for my friend Ed Koch.
I'd love you to be there.

15:00.525 --> 15:03.277
Not as our ghetto mascot
as you implied before,

15:03.361 --> 15:07.115
but as a young leader taking his first
transformative steps to help his city.

15:07.323 --> 15:11.536
Endorse Ed as a representative
of the future we're building.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.913
-Could you do that?
-Next Saturday?

15:13.996 --> 15:17.583
-Or do you have something else scheduled?
-My friends and I have this music thing.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.045
I can do both.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.256
Welcome aboard, Ezekiel.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.484
So, how you feeling?

15:44.318 --> 15:45.194
I'm all right.

15:45.486 --> 15:46.737
-You sure?
-Yeah.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.117
Wolf was your friend, right?

15:53.327 --> 15:54.287
Mine, too.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.123
It's hard growing up, ain't it?

16:00.418 --> 16:02.170
Come on. Give Annie a hug.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.006
It's okay, baby.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.341
It's okay.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.514
It's a rough game we play, man.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.892
But it's the only one we got, right?

16:16.934 --> 16:18.311
You a man now.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.355
The kind of man I knew you'd be.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.485
And Annie's got so much love
in her heart for you.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.825
I remember the first day you came around.

16:34.285 --> 16:37.538
Looking so lost, like a little lost puppy.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.708
And we took you in like you was blood.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.126
And now you are.

16:42.627 --> 16:45.046
Now you in it all the way, sugar.

16:45.796 --> 16:48.382
You know, could've been worse for Wolf.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.428
For what he did, what he tried to do,

16:52.512 --> 16:56.015
there was a time when
I would've really made him suffer.

16:57.308 --> 17:00.061
But Annie's getting old and soft now.

17:02.104 --> 17:05.566
So, anybody asks you about Wolf,
what you gonna say?

17:05.942 --> 17:07.734
I don't know nothing about that.

17:09.111 --> 17:13.574
Now I'm gonna need you to, 
take over some of his responsibilities.

17:14.325 --> 17:17.703
So, Saturday night I'm gonna need you
on 123rd to supervise.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.080
-This Saturday?
-Yeah, this Saturday.

17:20.164 --> 17:23.584
No, no, Annie, I can't do that.
I got my music on Saturday.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.627
-A DJ'ing thing.
-A DJ thing?

17:25.711 --> 17:28.506
Something I've been planning for a while,
it's important.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.925
Ain't no "buts," man.
"Buts" are for children.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.719
You a man now.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.429
You gotta answer the call.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.724
All right, wait. What if I push
your product at my party instead?

17:38.808 --> 17:41.769
We're gonna have a crowd.
I could move more dust, coke and weed

17:41.852 --> 17:44.063
than every pusher on 123rd combined.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.357
I'm telling you, Annie,
we'll sell so much shit.

17:46.440 --> 17:50.069
I can do my DJ thing and make you
beaucoup profit. I can do both.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.113
I promise you.
Just give me one go at this.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.120
Well, if you say so, sugar.

18:03.749 --> 18:07.003
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm a little disgusted with myself.

18:07.795 --> 18:11.340
Just make sure that the record
gets out to the DJs, okay?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.509
-No chance, Jackie.
-What?

18:13.593 --> 18:15.177
But nice seeing you again.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.013
Yo, Leslie, I--

18:18.431 --> 18:20.474
Come on. I'll go to the police.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.769
-For what?
-That was rape. I was raped.

18:23.853 --> 18:24.854
So was I.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.608
You and your girl are dead
in this business, Jackie.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.693
Please, you gotta give me a chance.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.903
- Fuck off.
- Yeah, fuck off.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.488
You're psychotic.

18:35.865 --> 18:39.827
<i>Only one in ten disco records</i>
<i>has any chance of getting on the radio.</i>

18:40.036 --> 18:43.789
Most are discarded,
never to be danced to again.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.625
<i>Jackie, you look funny.</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

18:46.292 --> 18:48.294
She said it's a hit. Fuck Misty Holloway.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.962
-No way. Really?
-No.

18:50.338 --> 18:53.591
Mylene, in my past, I've done--
I've done bad things.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.135
I just need 24 hours.
Please don't tell your <i>tío.</i>

18:56.719 --> 18:57.803
I'm sorry, baby.

18:59.347 --> 19:00.181
I'm sorry.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.517
But we ain't dead yet.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.527
So, what's, like, Rumi's
ultimate goal in this graffiti gig?

19:13.611 --> 19:15.905
-Goal?
-I can't believe Rumi wants to be

19:15.988 --> 19:17.281
writing in tunnels his whole life.

19:17.365 --> 19:20.076
Doesn't he wanna rise
from some alien ashes?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.495
Be a phoenix? Find a new form?

19:23.954 --> 19:25.331
True, true.

19:26.082 --> 19:29.335
So, let him do it.
Set the alien in the top hat free, bro.

19:29.418 --> 19:33.381
-Introduce him to the world.
-Maybe. One day.

19:33.464 --> 19:36.634
Tonight.
There's an art party in a gallery.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.136
Phoenixes, aliens.
You should come down to SoHo.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.347
...okay, I guess.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.349
Don't worry. They'll let you in.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.267
We'll celebrate this.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.732

in New York.

19:53.693 --> 19:57.238

Jackie Moreno calling for Dan Gold.

20:04.954 --> 20:08.916
But the thing is, Janice,
this is a very time-sensitive opportunity.

20:08.999 --> 20:13.713
Les Lesgold from Turntable Tastemakers
went berserk when she heard "Set Me Free."

20:13.838 --> 20:16.966
- <i>Leslie Lesgold said it was dead.</i>
- Yeah, but listen, listen...

20:17.049 --> 20:21.178
Donna Summer heard an advance pressing
and she fired her whole entire staff.

20:21.262 --> 20:24.265
"Set Me Free" by Mylene Cruz.
I'm shocked you haven't heard of it.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.058
- <i>Your record is dead.</i>
- Okay, okay.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.644
It's gonna send the Bee Gees
back to Kangaroo-ville.

20:28.769 --> 20:32.189

patch me through to Mr. Weinbaum, dear.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.645
I brought something for you.

22:35.646 --> 22:37.898
It's my sister's record, "Set Me Free."

22:37.982 --> 22:39.024
When I heard it, I thought of you.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.447
You should get Carlo to play it.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.950
- Carlo?
- Pakoussa. The DJ.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.786

- Ho!

Magnificent, magnificent solitude.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.425
Are they boys or girls?

23:04.508 --> 23:09.638
Both. Boys dressed as girls,
boys with girls trapped inside.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.016
Boys changing into girls.

No, no, no. You were supposed to send
a thousand textbooks

27:26.520 --> 27:28.313
and two dozen school desks.

27:28.397 --> 27:32.317
Instead you sent two dozen books
and zero desks.

27:32.401 --> 27:33.485
<i>Que fue--</i>

27:34.152 --> 27:36.864
Roy Asheton from Marrakesh Star
on Line 2.

27:36.947 --> 27:38.407
I'm gonna call you right back.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.747
Gran Barrio Records,
Francisco Cruz, CEO speaking.

27:45.831 --> 27:48.125
Who's calling please? Roy Asheton?

27:48.208 --> 27:51.670
I know who you are, Roy.
Marrakesh Star Records, right?

27:53.130 --> 27:54.923
Thank you.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.218
Well, yeah, we think the world
of Mylene over here, too.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.513
What? Today?

28:02.347 --> 28:05.309
Well, we're kind of busy over here
right now, Roy.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.854
But you know what, why not?

28:09.855 --> 28:12.190
Well, yeah, me and Mylene, of course.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.444
Well, we can be there later,
you just give me the address.

28:16.528 --> 28:17.696
You're gonna send a limo.

28:18.822 --> 28:22.034
Fine, that'll work.
Okay, we'll see you later on today.

28:26.079 --> 28:28.707
You... take the rest of the day off.

28:29.082 --> 28:31.084
<i>Pero </i> get me Mylene on the phone first.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.801
Whoa.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.221
Hold it! Hold it, hold it. Hold the line.

28:42.304 --> 28:44.097
Hey, hold the line.
Hold the line.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.933
Hold, hold it, hold it, hold it.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.311
Moreno Industries,
Jackie Moreno speaking, how may--?

28:49.394 --> 28:50.354
Francisco.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.316
Francisco, <i>qué pasa,</i> bro?
It's funny, I was just gonna call you.

28:54.399 --> 28:59.154
I wanted to-- You're going where?
That's not a good idea, that's a bad idea.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.823
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You cannot go up there without me.

29:01.907 --> 29:02.741
I'm on my way.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.766
Good cake.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.352
<i>Forgive me, Mr. Asheton,</i>
<i>Teddy Pendergrass, Line 2.</i>

29:30.435 --> 29:32.980
- Take a message.
- Did she say "Teddy Pendergrass"?

29:33.063 --> 29:34.523
So, Mr. Cruz,

29:34.606 --> 29:36.900
-like I said before--
-Hold on for a second.

29:36.984 --> 29:38.652
I don't mean any disrespect, Roy.

29:38.735 --> 29:42.364
But if you're too big-time to take
Teddy Pendergrass' phone call,

29:42.447 --> 29:44.574
how I know what you'll do
with my phone calls?

29:44.658 --> 29:46.410
-Or my niece's?
-Fair question.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.245
Teddy's on tour right now.

29:48.370 --> 29:51.456
While on tour,
Teddy enjoys copious amounts of...

29:52.291 --> 29:54.626
-winter sports.
-Winter sports?

29:55.127 --> 29:55.961
Skiing.

29:57.129 --> 30:01.383
- "Peruvian slopes."
. <i>Entiendo,</i> yeah. I-- I see.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.719
Teddy'd be broke by Harrisburg
if I didn't ignore his calls.

30:04.886 --> 30:07.139
- <i>Sorry, I tried to stop him.</i>
- Cisco! Cisco, don't--

30:07.222 --> 30:09.016
- Hey.
- Don't listen to this guy.

30:09.099 --> 30:10.809
This fucking guy, he's a liar.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.686
-Jackie.
-Cisco, I came down here...

30:12.769 --> 30:14.438
Jackie fucking Moreno.

30:14.521 --> 30:16.523
...to admit my wrongdoings.
I'm gonna pay you back.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.900
I'm just begging you right now
to hear me out.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.111
Is that Jackie fucking Moreno
I see before me?

30:21.194 --> 30:24.197
-I bet you are enjoying this, aren't you?
-You know what you are?

30:24.281 --> 30:25.782
Yeah! It's not good, either!

30:25.866 --> 30:28.493
-You are a fucking genius!
-But that doesn't mean--

30:29.536 --> 30:33.498
You hear me?
A genius, that's what you are.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.877
-Jackie, have some cake.
-You guys-- You guys are eating cake?

30:36.960 --> 30:39.171
- Have a slice, it's light.
- And buttery.

30:39.254 --> 30:42.966
I always believed in you.
You know that, right?

30:43.050 --> 30:46.136
You just needed some tough love.
I provided it, and now look.

30:46.219 --> 30:48.972
"Set Me Free" is a winner,
the first of many.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.850
- You think it's a winner?
- Who gives a shit what I think?

30:51.933 --> 30:55.228
Your record is busting out
in all the gay clubs.

30:55.354 --> 30:59.024
And disco hits don't become hits
unless all the fairies

30:59.149 --> 31:00.984
wave their wands in unison.

31:01.109 --> 31:04.696
"Set Me Free" has a 21-gun salute from
every wand-waving Tinker Bell in town.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.407
-Yeah, I mean...
-How'd you get to Carlo Pakoussa?

31:09.242 --> 31:11.203
Hey, man, I don't-- I don't kiss and tell.

31:13.413 --> 31:17.209
This Pakoussa character, Mr. Cruz,
he's the king of the fairies.

31:17.292 --> 31:21.046
Doesn't have a pot to piss in,
yet his say-so makes stars overnight.

31:21.129 --> 31:23.298
And stars make money.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.051
That's what you're gonna be, Mylene,
if we do this right.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.844
Not so fast with the "we" shit, okay?

31:28.595 --> 31:31.264
What about this contract
that your lawyer sent?

31:31.348 --> 31:32.391
What lawyer?

31:32.557 --> 31:35.227
Ignore the contract.
Fuck the lawyer, he's fired.

31:35.477 --> 31:37.646
We'll make our own contract, together.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.357
An equitable one between all parties.

31:41.024 --> 31:41.858
Right, Jackie?

31:42.526 --> 31:44.945
I'm gonna tell you the truth, Roy.

31:45.779 --> 31:49.825
I asked Jackie about you, and he didn't
have a lot of good things to say.

31:52.119 --> 31:52.953
Okay.

31:53.829 --> 31:55.747
How about I put my cards on the table?

31:56.706 --> 32:00.085
I sell more disco albums
than any other label in the country.

32:00.335 --> 32:03.463
My records go number one,
my artists win Grammys.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.799
If you sign to Marrakesh Star,
you will make more money

32:05.882 --> 32:08.218
than you could anywhere else.

32:08.301 --> 32:11.471
Yes, I take a higher percentage
than other labels.

32:11.555 --> 32:16.226
But that's because I'm the fucking best.
And my employees are the fucking best.

32:16.393 --> 32:19.521
You will make more money and have
a longer career with me taking more

32:19.604 --> 32:21.356
than with anyone else taking less.

32:21.857 --> 32:25.068
Your niece, her two friends,
they're stars.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.279
"Set Me Free" is a hit.

32:27.863 --> 32:31.992
So, feel free to shop around.
But don't wait too long.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.326
I'm fickle

32:33.410 --> 32:35.662
and occasionally vindictive.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.707
My analyst says I should work on that.
I fired him.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.917
So, what do you say?

32:41.501 --> 32:42.961
I say we're a lot alike.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.713
Okay, then.

32:46.173 --> 32:48.592
We're gonna shop around a little,
then we'll get back to you.

32:48.675 --> 32:49.509
-No.
-Yes.

32:49.593 --> 32:54.181
No, no, no, <i>tío</i>. I want this.
I wanna sign with Mr. Asheton.

32:54.264 --> 32:57.559
Regina, Yolanda and I wanna be
at Marrakesh, same as Misty.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.811
I trust you to protect me
and Jackie to guide me.

32:59.895 --> 33:02.189
I'll let you write the contract
and I'll sign it,

33:02.272 --> 33:04.065
but we wanna be at Marrakesh.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.192
Okay?

33:08.320 --> 33:09.154
Fine.

33:10.363 --> 33:13.825
Roy, you're a serious man.
I'm a serious man, too.

33:13.909 --> 33:16.036
I know you are, I looked you up.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.787
Good. So, then...

33:18.455 --> 33:20.832
-we understand each other.
-Absolutely.

33:20.916 --> 33:24.544
Hey, welcome to the music business.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.340

34:27.983 --> 34:31.820

You all know how much we've suffered
for years under Mayor Beame.

35:44.601 --> 35:49.356
Mayor Abe Beame, who has proven himself
time and time again

35:49.439 --> 35:52.359
to be an incompetent, insensitive,

35:52.442 --> 35:55.403
bean-counting, pencil-pushing
little midget...

35:56.404 --> 35:59.616
...who has betrayed our people
and our community.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.034
- Yeah.
- That's right.

36:01.951 --> 36:03.453
And then there's Mario Cuomo.

36:03.536 --> 36:06.581
-I like Mario Cuomo. I know Mario.
-Can I have that after?

36:06.665 --> 36:10.960
I used to play sandlot baseball
with-with-with Mario, a long time ago.

36:11.169 --> 36:15.840
<i>Pero</i>, the unions,
they have Mario in their pockets.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.384
<i>Es la verdad.</i> That's the truth.

36:17.967 --> 36:21.012
And I like the unions,
but I'm gonna ask you something right now.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.474
How many of you actually have
a nice union job?

36:24.974 --> 36:26.768
- Nope. No.
- That's right.

36:27.268 --> 36:30.271
The unions are not just gonna
open up for us on their own.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.982
Poverty is not just gonna end on its own.

36:34.317 --> 36:37.195
The Bronx is not gonna stop burning
on its own!

36:39.781 --> 36:43.159
I pulled you off the corner because
Annie needs y'all working the crowd.

36:44.244 --> 36:48.039
Annie don't play, so I don't wanna hear
about no problems offing this shit.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.874
- Yo, we got you, Shao.
- All right.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.710
Five twenties to a gram.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.586
Don't take no shorts.

36:53.753 --> 36:56.256
Get that money. 'Cause if you don't,
I'll have hell to pay.

36:56.339 --> 36:59.008
- If I gotta pay, y'all gonna pay, too.
- Get Down Brothers.

36:59.092 --> 37:01.594
Watch out for the stick-up kids.
Where the fuck is Zeke?

37:03.346 --> 37:06.057
We need a guy in city hall
who cares about us.

37:06.141 --> 37:10.186
We need someone who's gonna bring
the proper services to us, right up here!

37:10.812 --> 37:14.441
- We need jobs and safe streets.
- Yes.

37:14.524 --> 37:16.818
Clean, affordable homes for our people.

37:16.901 --> 37:20.280
Ladies and gentlemen, <i>damas y caballeros</i>,

37:20.363 --> 37:22.407
that man is sitting with us
here right now.

37:22.741 --> 37:26.703
The next mayor of New York.
Born in the Bronx.

37:26.786 --> 37:29.080
- A friend of the Bronx.
- All right.

37:29.164 --> 37:32.333
A tough guy for tough times. Bronx tough.

37:32.417 --> 37:33.543
<i>Vamos a darle la mano.</i>

37:33.626 --> 37:37.130
Ed Koch! Give him a hand. Ed Koch!

37:39.841 --> 37:46.014
The sounds you hear.
Deaf to your ear.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.348
Are you ready?

37:49.517 --> 37:52.061
-Damn, man, yo, what is that?
-That's the Echoplex.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.481
We can't fight that without Zeke.

37:55.273 --> 38:00.195
Listen up!
We say ladies first.

38:03.823 --> 38:07.035
Fuck Zeke. We don't need him.
This is a DJ battle, right?

38:07.118 --> 38:10.955
Don't forget, whichever crew
gets the B-boys to rock

38:11.039 --> 38:14.083
is the crew that comes out on top.

38:14.834 --> 38:17.545
Hello, South Bronx!

38:17.629 --> 38:21.007
-How you doing?
-We got no hot water. How you doing?

38:21.174 --> 38:24.511
And let me tell you, that is a crime.

38:24.594 --> 38:30.517
And speaking of crime, how many of you
feel safe in your own neighborhood?

38:30.600 --> 38:34.103
-Spend a night out here and find out!
-I grew up here.

38:34.187 --> 38:39.400
And what I see is nothing short
of a national emergency.

38:39.484 --> 38:43.822
And you know what?
It makes me mad as hell.

38:43.905 --> 38:44.823
How about you?

38:44.906 --> 38:46.199
Yeah!

38:46.282 --> 38:47.534
I'm mad.

38:48.409 --> 38:52.247
I mean, look at this place.
This used to be a nice place.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.832
You see that wall?

38:54.415 --> 38:58.127
You know what that wall said
when I was a kid? Nothing.

38:58.753 --> 39:02.674
Because when I was a kid,
we had a mayor who cared

39:02.757 --> 39:05.760
about hoodlums defacing public property.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.721
Whoo!

39:29.492 --> 39:31.452
Job one when I am mayor:

39:31.578 --> 39:37.417
Francisco Cruz and I are gonna build new,
clean, affordable housing right here.

39:38.001 --> 39:40.795
That's right, right here.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.381
But when we do...

39:44.007 --> 39:48.219
there won't be any more vile,
lawless graffiti animals to worry about.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.096
Because guess what?

39:50.263 --> 39:55.393
I'm gonna pass laws
to put those vandals behind bars.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.062
That's right.

39:58.146 --> 40:01.149
-Yo, Dizzee better watch out.
-Yo, forget this dude.

40:01.232 --> 40:06.070
Mandatory three-day sentences
for all repeat graffiti thugs.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.574
Yeah!

40:12.702 --> 40:16.247
Graffiti will die under Ed Koch!

40:36.893 --> 40:38.019
Yo, turn on the Berthas.

40:44.317 --> 40:46.527
Friends, you all know...

40:46.653 --> 40:50.031
...that some of our brightest hopes
for the future

40:50.114 --> 40:53.618
reside right here in the South Bronx...

40:54.494 --> 40:56.079
and I'd like you to meet one of them.

40:56.871 --> 40:57.705
Come here, son.

41:01.167 --> 41:04.671
This is Ezekiel Figuero...

41:09.175 --> 41:13.554
...the first participant
in the new internship program

41:13.638 --> 41:15.556
at the Fiscal Control Committee.

41:16.140 --> 41:19.352
Ezekiel, you're not one of these, 
graffiti bums, right?

41:22.355 --> 41:23.189
No, sir.

41:23.773 --> 41:26.609
And he's certainly
not one of those delinquents

41:26.734 --> 41:29.028
making all that noisy racket over there.

41:29.112 --> 41:30.697
With the boom-boom-boom, is he?

41:32.657 --> 41:35.326
Give Ezekiel a hand.

41:43.543 --> 41:45.878
We can't hear you!

41:47.588 --> 41:50.258
Play! Loud!

41:50.383 --> 41:53.803
Your system ain't strong enough.

41:55.346 --> 41:59.726
We gonna give you a taste of the bass.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.398

Um... I wrote a speech.

43:00.995 --> 43:02.705
But who's got time for all that, right?

43:03.915 --> 43:05.083
So, I'm gonna just riff this.

43:08.294 --> 43:12.298
The-- The super-cool Persian poet Rumi
once wrote:

43:13.883 --> 43:16.886
"Where there's ruin,
there's hope for a treasure."

43:20.640 --> 43:23.142
Now, the other day I was up on 183rd,

43:23.226 --> 43:25.603
and this rich lady called it "taki," man.

43:28.731 --> 43:31.567
But I talked to my man Tracy from 168th.

43:33.194 --> 43:36.906
And he said,
"Listen for the voice of the ghetto."

43:37.615 --> 43:38.950
Yeah.

43:40.284 --> 43:42.662
'Cause it crashes down on you
when you least expect it.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.789
That's you, man.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.836
Even from the cats that stay high...

43:50.837 --> 43:51.712
on 149th Street.

43:53.756 --> 43:55.883
Now, I could daze.

43:55.967 --> 43:56.926
Right.

43:57.510 --> 44:01.139
Or doze off,
or talk about the comets in the sky.

44:01.222 --> 44:03.516
Or how quick they fly by.

44:04.892 --> 44:05.726
Or I could listen.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.314
And say, we're a team.

44:11.107 --> 44:13.484
Aw, yeah!

44:14.443 --> 44:16.195
And as a crew or a squad...

44:17.155 --> 44:18.614
we work together like Moses did...

44:19.448 --> 44:21.200
- <i>to help his people.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

44:23.703 --> 44:25.872
Some--
Some of you know what I'm talking about.

44:25.955 --> 44:26.998
Yeah.

44:27.999 --> 44:29.000
For the rest of you...

44:29.750 --> 44:30.751
let me just say this.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.589
The young people aren't the problem.

44:35.923 --> 44:36.841
We're the solution.

44:37.717 --> 44:40.636
Yeah!

44:43.723 --> 44:45.224
That's what my mama used to say.

44:47.185 --> 44:48.144
She's dead now.

44:48.769 --> 44:49.604
My pops is, too.

44:53.107 --> 44:57.862
But I'm gonna do my best to show
all of you that my mama was right.

44:59.488 --> 45:01.782
Which is why I'm honored to be here.

45:01.866 --> 45:04.452
I'm proud Papa Fuerte
gave me this opportunity.

45:05.328 --> 45:06.245
And...

45:07.580 --> 45:08.623
vote Ed Koch for mayor.

45:08.706 --> 45:10.082
- Yeah!
- All right!

45:11.584 --> 45:12.585
I gotta go...

45:13.461 --> 45:15.713

but you tied it up beautifully.

45:34.273 --> 45:38.986
So, anyway, let's hear it
for the voice of the ghetto, Ezekiel.

45:43.574 --> 45:44.575
Voice of the ghetto?

45:45.618 --> 45:47.995
"Stay high 149,"
I think I've seen that before.

45:48.079 --> 45:49.246
Yeah, keep it to yourself.

45:49.330 --> 45:50.873
- That was amazing.
- Without further ado,

45:55.962 --> 45:59.090
