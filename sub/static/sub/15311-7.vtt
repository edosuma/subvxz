So that's your mommy, that's you,
and that's your daddy?

00:07.153 --> 00:08.452
Mmm-hmm.

00:08.454 --> 00:09.920
What is that? His heart?

00:09.922 --> 00:11.522
No. That's his badge.

00:11.524 --> 00:13.023
What happened here?

00:13.025 --> 00:14.425
Cheerleading.

00:14.427 --> 00:16.292
Yes, this is Dr. Dana Marsh calling.

00:16.294 --> 00:19.628
I'd like to report a possible case
of abuse involving a minor patient.

00:19.630 --> 00:21.897
How badly do you need this money?

00:21.899 --> 00:23.732
I think I might have a solution.

Don't move!

Archer Petit.
Born in Brooklyn. Age 36.

00:37.414 --> 00:39.181
Ex-military. No priors.

00:39.183 --> 00:41.983
I needed to backstop him,
so I falsified his travel records.

00:41.985 --> 00:44.352
- What the hell are you talking about?
- He's working for me.

00:44.354 --> 00:45.987
As a confidential informant.

00:45.989 --> 00:47.621
- Where's Archer now?
- In jail.

00:47.623 --> 00:49.423
- How come?
- I put him there.

Where's Brian?

00:50.993 --> 00:52.359
Keep going, sweetheart.
He doesn't know where you are.

- Unless what?

00:58.601 --> 00:59.600
We kill him.

01:05.272 --> 01:07.407
Come on. You beat me again?

01:07.409 --> 01:11.111
Why do you always beat me?
Every single time, I never win once.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.778
Are you looking for this?

01:14.848 --> 01:16.716
Can we watch cartoons now?

01:16.718 --> 01:20.586
(SIGHING) In a minute, sweetie, okay?
I just need to talk to Grandpa.

01:20.588 --> 01:22.554
Can Uncle Kramer come over?

01:23.889 --> 01:25.624
Not now, sweetie.

01:25.626 --> 01:28.960
You go play upstairs, okay?
Catch that!

01:28.962 --> 01:31.930
Catch that. Oh!
Good hands.

01:37.836 --> 01:39.637
So, how's he doing, anyway?

01:42.274 --> 01:47.211
Kramer is...
He's stronger than you think.

01:47.213 --> 01:48.646
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:48.648 --> 01:51.382
It's been a long time
since my last confession.

01:51.384 --> 01:52.916
What's on your mind, son?

01:52.918 --> 01:54.785
What sins have you committed?

01:57.155 --> 01:59.356
I've made some mistakes.

01:59.358 --> 02:03.661
What mistakes? To find absolution,
the faithful must confess.

02:03.663 --> 02:06.329
I've been worried about him.
Wasn't sure he had the stomach

02:06.331 --> 02:07.964
for this kind of thing.

02:07.966 --> 02:11.567
I had a problem,
he solved it on his own.

02:11.569 --> 02:13.269
I was impressed.

02:13.271 --> 02:14.537
That's good to hear.

02:15.572 --> 02:18.641
I'm trying to help someone I love.

02:18.643 --> 02:19.976
My sister.

02:21.111 --> 02:23.679
But how far is too far?

02:23.681 --> 02:26.581
Is it all right to do something
wrong for a good reason?

02:26.583 --> 02:28.917
That's a question only
the Lord can answer.

02:28.919 --> 02:32.154
But you need to confess your sins.

02:32.156 --> 02:35.623
Until you do, there will
never be true repentance.

DUNCAN:
We all set?

02:37.061 --> 02:39.094
I told you,
I've taken care of everything.

02:39.096 --> 02:41.988
I know. It's just...

02:44.032 --> 02:46.667
Sometimes I need to hear
you say it out loud.

02:46.669 --> 02:52.740
If things don't proceed as planned,
Sawyer will be fine.

02:52.742 --> 02:55.509
She'll have a beautiful place
to live in upstate New York,

02:55.511 --> 02:56.843
plenty of money,

02:58.245 --> 03:00.980
and most importantly,

03:00.982 --> 03:02.648
a loved one to take care of her.

03:04.118 --> 03:07.053
Sawyer loves her Aunt Leslie
very much. You know that.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.557
Yeah, I know that.

Good news is,
we still have eight days.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.675
But I'm gonna need some help.

03:31.677 --> 03:33.044
From who?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.779
Her husband.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.749
Despite his money troubles,
the affair,

03:37.751 --> 03:40.584
she still looks up to him.
Still loves him.

03:45.623 --> 03:49.325
If I can turn Brian into an ally,

03:49.327 --> 03:52.061
I can turn Ellen into a killer.

I did. On my end.

04:10.281 --> 04:12.514
But now his lawyer's
talking to the DA's office.

04:12.516 --> 04:14.349
He's trying to cut a plea deal
with them instead.

04:14.351 --> 04:17.517
- They're willing to listen?
- Willing? They can't wait.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.688
They're meeting today at five.
If this guy flips,

04:20.690 --> 04:23.491
tells the truth about what
happened to the President's nurse,

04:23.493 --> 04:25.559

Nothing.

a better partner.

I want another chance.

We can talk about all that later.

After we...

06:51.398 --> 06:53.698
After we kill this son of a bitch?

06:54.867 --> 06:57.201
I can try to find another gun.
I have some friends who...

06:57.203 --> 06:59.938
Then what? We try shooting him
before he shoots us?

06:59.940 --> 07:02.573
Do you even know how to use a gun?
'Cause I don't.

07:03.275 --> 07:07.078
He's in the FBI.
A trained professional.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.327
So what are you saying?

07:08.332 --> 07:10.160
I just think we need some help.
We're not killers.

07:10.195 --> 07:12.149
Says who?

07:12.151 --> 07:13.883
What about the poison
he gave you?

07:13.885 --> 07:16.253
You said you kept it.
It's in the closet, right?

07:16.255 --> 07:19.323
I don't even know what kind it is,
how potent...

07:19.325 --> 07:21.691
He gave it to you to kill the President.
I'm sure it's potent.

07:21.693 --> 07:23.060
You'll never get close enough.

07:23.062 --> 07:25.162
I'll find a way.
I'll wait for the right moment.

07:25.164 --> 07:28.831
Brian. You can barely even walk,
for God's sake.

07:28.833 --> 07:31.700
I can do this.
I'll use that to my advantage,

07:32.669 --> 07:34.770
I'll pretend I'm not feeling well.

07:34.772 --> 07:36.439
He'll forget I'm even here.

07:36.441 --> 07:39.475
It's so dangerous.
We just need some professional help here.

07:39.477 --> 07:42.644
Well, I don't have a lot of killers
on my speed dial. You?

07:44.546 --> 07:46.247
No, I...

07:46.249 --> 07:48.016

The President's surgery

08:19.601 --> 08:22.634
Regardless of his health,
his blood tests, his EKG.

08:22.636 --> 08:26.571
He's not a patient anymore, Ellen.
He's a target.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.988
Sup, bro? I was hoping we
could talk in private.

08:52.430 --> 08:54.697
I know you don't talk to cops.

08:54.699 --> 08:58.268
But I still want to compensate you
for being so loyal.

08:58.270 --> 09:00.170
How's an extra 10 G sound?

09:00.172 --> 09:02.506
Keep your money, I'm good.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.807
Business is business.

09:04.809 --> 09:06.176
But you already paid me.

09:07.178 --> 09:09.278
Consider it a gift.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.712
If you insist.

09:10.714 --> 09:12.014
That's more like it, right?

09:14.817 --> 09:16.685
What, you can't give me a pound?

09:20.290 --> 09:22.258
Keep it moving, boys.

09:37.039 --> 09:39.507
Your vital signs are great.
That's terrific news.

09:41.242 --> 09:42.546
Don't yell at your assistant.

09:42.550 --> 09:45.824
I forced my way in
over her strenuous objections.

09:45.847 --> 09:47.614
Vanessa,
we're in the middle of a...

09:47.616 --> 09:49.449
I won't be long.

09:49.451 --> 09:51.185
You have one minute, Ambassador.

09:51.187 --> 09:52.886
What is it you need to tell me?

09:52.888 --> 09:54.555
You're a coward.

09:54.557 --> 09:57.590
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
Now then, if you'll excuse us.

09:57.592 --> 09:59.091
I still have 53 seconds.

09:59.093 --> 10:00.693
For God's sake, Vanessa.
Not now.

10:00.695 --> 10:03.496
The benefit dinner in memory of
my brother is tomorrow night,

10:03.498 --> 10:05.264
and you're not attending.

10:05.266 --> 10:06.999
Perhaps I should just wait
outside while you finish...

10:07.001 --> 10:09.502
It's not a benefit.
It's a political event.

10:09.504 --> 10:11.337
It's a family event.

10:11.339 --> 10:13.572
Doesn't Peter's memory
mean anything to you?

10:13.574 --> 10:16.208
We can talk about this later.
In private.

10:16.210 --> 10:18.109
Take a deep breath, please.

10:18.111 --> 10:20.778
I would like
to introduce Dr. Sanders.

It's a pleasure.
I've heard great things about you.

is Vanessa Moore. My sister.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.237
Hi, Morgan, pleasure to meet you.

10:47.239 --> 10:51.058
I'm following up on a report
from your OB/GYN, Dr. Marsh.

10:51.093 --> 10:54.009
She noted bruising
on your arms and legs.

10:54.011 --> 10:58.013
Like I said, I just bumped it
in gym class.

10:58.015 --> 10:59.782
Can you show me the bruises?

11:01.317 --> 11:02.317
Yep.

11:03.453 --> 11:04.586
Hmm.

11:04.588 --> 11:06.421
Do you have a boyfriend?

11:06.423 --> 11:07.723
Had.

11:07.725 --> 11:09.324
How do you two get along?

11:09.326 --> 11:12.661
He's never laid a hand on me.
Ever. And he never would.

11:12.663 --> 11:16.664
What about your parents?
Do you have a good relationship with them?

11:17.499 --> 11:20.033
Yes. We love each other very much.

11:22.704 --> 11:23.971
Can I go?

11:26.007 --> 11:28.976
I mean, come on, this is ridiculous.
I have to get back to class.

11:28.978 --> 11:30.144
Sure.

11:38.186 --> 11:40.794
I'd like to talk to her brother.

I'll see you soon.

11:49.330 --> 11:52.464
- I apologize for the family squabble.
- Oh.

11:52.466 --> 11:54.600
My brother Peter was killed
a few years ago,

11:54.602 --> 11:57.002
and it's still a very
emotional topic for us all.

11:57.004 --> 11:59.505
I did read that.
I'm sorry for your loss.

11:59.507 --> 12:02.441
Peter's politics didn't coincide
with the President's,

12:02.443 --> 12:04.942
and so this benefit dinner
tomorrow night

12:04.944 --> 12:08.346
is more sensitive
than one might imagine.

12:08.348 --> 12:12.317
I presume my sister's outburst
will remain confidential?

12:12.319 --> 12:16.621
Oh, of course. The truth is,
I didn't hear a thing, I was so nervous.

12:16.623 --> 12:19.190
I told my husband to fire you.

12:19.192 --> 12:21.558
Don't get me wrong,
I enjoyed your speech

12:21.560 --> 12:23.460
about being a great thoracic surgeon.

12:23.462 --> 12:26.396
And I respect your confidence.

12:26.398 --> 12:31.802
But I'm an unforgiving woman, especially
in matters involving my husband.

12:32.937 --> 12:34.504
I understand.

12:34.506 --> 12:37.005
So, I just want to make
myself clear.

12:37.007 --> 12:41.109
If another innocent mistake occurs,
I will hold you personally accountable.

12:52.155 --> 12:54.188
WOMAN: District of Columbia
Police Department.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.392
Yes, hi, I was just inquiring...

12:57.394 --> 13:00.995
I saw a man unconscious
Saturday on the street.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.330
He was bleeding.

13:02.332 --> 13:06.200
On Foxhill Drive.
Yeah, I called it in

13:06.202 --> 13:11.137
and I was just wondering if the man is...
Well, if he's okay.

13:11.139 --> 13:13.106
And who am I talking with?

13:15.810 --> 13:17.344
What's your name, sir?

13:17.346 --> 13:18.479
(HANGS UP)

13:18.481 --> 13:21.815
Kramer.
What happened the other night...

13:21.817 --> 13:25.518
- It wasn't your fault.
- I'm fine.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.487
Ellen just left the White House.

13:27.489 --> 13:29.054
She's on her way back
to the hospital.

13:36.029 --> 13:39.699
You okay? Look,
I know this has been stressful.

13:40.933 --> 13:43.134
You weren't expecting
to be here this long.

13:43.136 --> 13:45.203
Nothing to worry about, Coach.

13:45.205 --> 13:46.805
I'll be back in a little bit.

13:48.374 --> 13:50.308
Wait, where you going?
We're a man down.

13:50.310 --> 13:52.811
To see Nina.
She called earlier.

13:52.813 --> 13:56.614
She sounded lonely.
I told her I'd stop by.

14:05.857 --> 14:07.792
(OPENING AND CLOSING DRAWERS)

14:18.836 --> 14:19.903
What are you doing?

14:25.075 --> 14:26.876
I assume you're not
going to work today.

14:26.878 --> 14:30.378
No. Not feeling well.
I haven't been sleeping.

14:32.415 --> 14:33.782
Must be painful, huh?

14:35.685 --> 14:39.154
I need you to come downstairs.
I have a project for you.

14:48.964 --> 14:50.439
We need to patch this up.

14:50.444 --> 14:52.481
You used to work for your father's
construction company,

14:52.569 --> 14:56.871
so fixing a tiny bullet hole like this
should be pretty easy.

14:56.873 --> 14:59.139
I think I can handle it.

15:13.087 --> 15:15.021
(PHONE RINGING)

15:15.023 --> 15:17.255
- Hello?
- What are we doing here?

15:17.257 --> 15:19.091
Thought you were on your way
to the hospital.

15:19.093 --> 15:21.560
- I have a house call.
- You're supposed to tell me in advance.

15:21.562 --> 15:23.496
Well, I'm sorry, I forgot.

15:23.498 --> 15:26.431
But if I don't show, he'll start
calling and asking lots of questions.

15:26.433 --> 15:27.700
Make it fast.

15:49.888 --> 15:50.888
Thank you.

15:56.994 --> 15:58.828
You're home. Thank God.

16:01.331 --> 16:03.533
Ellen?

16:03.535 --> 16:04.734
I need help.

16:05.869 --> 16:08.638
Of course. Tell me everything.

16:17.107 --> 16:18.974
My family is in danger.

16:18.976 --> 16:20.209
What's going on?

16:20.211 --> 16:22.577
- (SIGHING HEAVILY)
- Ellen?

16:22.579 --> 16:25.347
You know you can trust me,
that's why you're here.

16:25.349 --> 16:27.950
My family is being held hostage.

16:27.952 --> 16:30.051
What?
What are you talking about?

16:30.053 --> 16:31.419
Well, they broke into
our house the night before

16:31.421 --> 16:33.020
I was supposed to operate
on the President,

16:33.022 --> 16:35.523
and they said to me if I
didn't kill him during surgery

16:35.525 --> 16:37.425
they would murder my family.

16:37.427 --> 16:40.161
The leader of the group is this guy
named Duncan Carlisle.

16:40.163 --> 16:41.396
He's an FBI agent.

16:41.398 --> 16:42.731
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

16:42.733 --> 16:44.599
I've seen his badge.

16:44.601 --> 16:47.868
He's investigating the suicide of the
President's nurse, who was my friend.

16:47.870 --> 16:49.503
But he's the one who killed her!

16:49.505 --> 16:51.872
I mean, this guy
has connections everywhere.

16:51.874 --> 16:53.707
I know this all sounds crazy...

16:53.709 --> 16:55.409
Slow down.
We're going to get through this.

16:55.411 --> 16:57.043
He almost killed my sister.

16:57.045 --> 16:58.779
He's just... He's evil.

16:58.781 --> 17:01.214
I'll find a way to end this.
I promise.

17:01.216 --> 17:02.482
I want him dead.

17:06.387 --> 17:07.387
(BUZZING)

17:17.863 --> 17:19.964
Where you going?

17:19.965 --> 17:22.133
We need to have a little talk.

17:22.135 --> 17:23.201
About what?

17:25.971 --> 17:30.475
Malik's cousin is a friend of mine.
A good friend. You understand?

17:32.244 --> 17:33.211
(GROANS)

17:35.747 --> 17:37.415
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.082
Maybe this will help.

17:40.952 --> 17:42.820
Stay away from Malik.

17:42.822 --> 17:46.089
Next time, I won't be so gentle.

17:46.091 --> 17:48.992
Everything at home is great.

17:48.994 --> 17:50.627
Your parents and Morgan
get along okay?

17:50.629 --> 17:51.861
Yes.

17:52.963 --> 17:55.699
Do they fight, argue?

17:55.701 --> 17:57.300
Well, sure.
When she's annoying.

17:58.469 --> 18:01.638
Does it ever get physical?

18:01.640 --> 18:03.373
No. Never.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.274
She and your father have
a good relationship?

18:05.276 --> 18:07.009
Yeah.

18:07.011 --> 18:08.910
Do you know her boyfriend?

18:10.380 --> 18:12.882
No, not really. Can I leave?

18:12.884 --> 18:15.084
Just one more question.

18:15.086 --> 18:16.752
How'd you get that bruise
on your eye?

18:18.788 --> 18:21.090
Uh...
(LAUGHING AWKWARDLY)

18:21.092 --> 18:23.258
I took a hit at lacrosse practice.

18:23.260 --> 18:25.327
And one of your coaches
can verify that?

18:25.329 --> 18:27.662
Sure. My father.

18:27.664 --> 18:29.597
Someone other than him.

18:34.370 --> 18:38.072
Just tell me the truth.
I'm only trying to help.

18:38.074 --> 18:40.407
I got into a fight, okay?

18:40.409 --> 18:42.343
At home? Where? With who?

18:45.013 --> 18:47.047
What time do your parents
come home from work?

18:47.049 --> 18:48.448
I don't know. Why?

18:48.450 --> 18:49.884
I'd like to talk to them.

18:51.219 --> 18:53.254
That wouldn't really...

18:54.788 --> 18:56.289
My parents are out of town,

18:56.291 --> 18:59.158
and my cousin Susan
is staying with us. So...

18:59.160 --> 19:02.028
Great. I'll talk to her instead.

19:02.030 --> 19:05.598
Okay, fine.
I got into a fight with...

19:05.600 --> 19:07.166
Morgan's boyfriend.

19:08.535 --> 19:10.468
His name is Boyd.

19:10.470 --> 19:14.039
About what?
Do you think he's abusing her?

19:30.122 --> 19:32.189

Hey, man.

19:38.431 --> 19:39.530
You know that dude's name?

19:39.532 --> 19:41.932
Yeah. Murphy.

19:53.177 --> 19:54.311

19:56.113 --> 19:57.113
No.

(LOUD SIGHING)

20:04.821 --> 20:07.789
I know this has been difficult.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.525
We never planned on being
in your house this long.

20:12.862 --> 20:17.598
But you can survive this, Brian.
Eight more days.

20:17.600 --> 20:21.069
That's it.
After that, you're a free man.

20:23.105 --> 20:24.638
As long as Ellen cooperates.

20:29.911 --> 20:35.215
It's your job, as the head of the family,
to convince her.

20:35.217 --> 20:38.251
That she knows the only way out
is to do what I ask.

20:40.221 --> 20:41.888
Kill the President.

20:41.890 --> 20:43.857
Correct.

20:43.859 --> 20:46.425
So if she does this, she injects
the President with the poison...

20:46.427 --> 20:47.559
he'll die instantly?

20:47.561 --> 20:48.894
Within seconds.

20:49.963 --> 20:52.164
You're positive?

20:52.166 --> 20:56.068
I need to know, if I ask her
to do this, it's going to work.

20:58.972 --> 21:02.607
That he'll die right away
and will it be traceable?

21:04.877 --> 21:07.712
Will it look like he's
dying of natural causes?

21:07.714 --> 21:12.483
I need to know that,
uh, she won't get caught.

21:13.219 --> 21:14.285
She won't.

21:20.158 --> 21:22.326
All right, well...

21:22.328 --> 21:24.395
I'll talk to her.
Hopefully she'll listen.

21:24.397 --> 21:25.429
She will.

21:26.998 --> 21:28.999
She respects you.

21:29.001 --> 21:30.367
Yeah, she used to.

21:35.572 --> 21:39.108
Your marriage can survive this.

you'll be fine.

No, I'm sorry, sweetie, I think
you're mistaking me for someone else.

No. You asked me to draw
a picture of my family.

was his heart, remember?

You're doing the wrong math, Ellen.
"Why" doesn't matter.

What if I don't do
what Duncan asks?

28:37.506 --> 28:40.542
Fifteen years ago, you killed
that son-of-a-bitch rapist.

28:40.544 --> 28:43.211
(SNIFFLING)
He started walking toward me.

28:43.213 --> 28:44.587
So, I...

28:44.628 --> 28:47.766
Were you afraid for your life?
Was he holding a weapon?

28:47.801 --> 28:50.716
The meeting is over, Detective.
I'm her lawyer.

28:56.323 --> 28:59.960
My name is Burton Delaney.
I'm a friend of your father's.

28:59.962 --> 29:01.862
I'm going to take care of everything.

29:03.965 --> 29:07.634
Do you want me
to tell you what happened?

29:07.636 --> 29:11.170
No. I'm going to
tell you what happened.

29:11.172 --> 29:14.706
And you're going to tell the
detective exactly what I tell you.

29:15.742 --> 29:16.742
Understand?

29:21.414 --> 29:24.316
You're a strong woman,
I've seen it with my own eyes.

29:24.318 --> 29:25.784
This was your idea?

29:27.419 --> 29:30.621
Oh, my God.
You told him about me.

29:30.623 --> 29:34.993
Her name is Ellen Sanders.
She's a world-class surgeon.

29:34.995 --> 29:37.796
- Are you suggesting...
- Convince the President to use her.

29:39.665 --> 29:41.265
And how do you know
she'll come through?

29:43.935 --> 29:47.938
You were the perfect choice.
We needed a surgeon with mettle.

29:47.940 --> 29:50.540
Someone tough enough
to actually kill the President.

29:58.949 --> 30:01.383
I want to make sure
you understand my position.

30:04.154 --> 30:06.622
I think I do.
Tell me if I'm close.

30:06.624 --> 30:09.926
You're a political whore
devoid of any true emotions.

30:12.729 --> 30:16.632
I loved your brother very much.
He was a great man.

30:16.634 --> 30:20.602
He was my friend. He had a very
promising career ahead of him.

30:20.604 --> 30:23.205
Youngest Senator in
the history of Virginia...

30:23.207 --> 30:25.207
He would have been President
someday.

30:25.209 --> 30:27.108
He would have been President now.

30:33.181 --> 30:34.982
You are a beautiful woman.

30:36.051 --> 30:37.852
Paul, no.

30:37.854 --> 30:40.187
I was just expressing an opinion.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.425
What happened, it was a mistake.

30:44.427 --> 30:45.559
Understand?

30:47.194 --> 30:50.230
Not a day goes by
that I don't hate myself for it.

30:50.232 --> 30:53.533
Hate is such a strong word.

31:12.018 --> 31:14.653
- Where are you going?
- I'm late for a meeting. Talk soon?

31:19.725 --> 31:22.928
I do hope your sister understands
the President's dilemma.

31:22.930 --> 31:25.030
She'll be fine.

31:25.032 --> 31:27.832
Well, if there's anything I can do
to help, don't be afraid to ask.

31:27.834 --> 31:29.634
Why would I be afraid to ask,
Quentin?

31:31.004 --> 31:32.371
You work for me.

31:39.644 --> 31:43.547
Let me guess. You just ran into
your sister. She's livid.

31:43.549 --> 31:47.084
- She'll get over it. Some day.
- Hmm.

31:47.086 --> 31:50.420
It's shocking how naive she is,
considering the family she grew up in.

31:50.422 --> 31:52.889
She and Peter were very close.

31:52.891 --> 31:55.825
About the same age,
they spent a lot of time together.

31:55.827 --> 31:59.229
- I know. But that's irrelevant.
- I understand.

31:59.231 --> 32:03.033
That's why I married you, sweetheart.
You see the big picture.

32:03.035 --> 32:04.767
The truth behind the lie.

32:04.769 --> 32:09.338
I do. But that's not
the reason you married me.

32:10.573 --> 32:11.807
Is that right?

32:11.809 --> 32:16.111
You needed money.
Connections.

32:16.113 --> 32:19.614
And someone to save
your failing political career.

32:21.051 --> 32:23.484
Now that is the truth behind the lie.

32:36.798 --> 32:38.665
Can you check to see
if my lawyer's here yet?

32:40.201 --> 32:42.035
I need a status on a visitor.

32:51.745 --> 32:53.646
- Help you?
- I'm here to see Malik Wallace.

32:53.648 --> 32:55.814
- You are?
- Randall Brown. His lawyer.

32:55.816 --> 32:58.351
We're supposed to meet
ADA Daniel Conley at 5:00.

32:58.353 --> 32:59.777
Just got a call about you.

32:59.815 --> 33:02.915
Sign in over there,
leave any metal objects in the basket.

33:11.430 --> 33:14.499
- Your lawyer just got here.
- Cool.

33:14.501 --> 33:18.036
They're sending an officer down
now to bring you on through.

33:18.038 --> 33:21.038
- Home free, brother.
- Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

33:52.169 --> 33:53.169
Hey, Ray?

33:54.538 --> 33:55.771
What's up?

33:55.773 --> 33:57.473
- I got something for you.
- What?

34:08.583 --> 34:11.886
Command, we got a problem in the yard,
we need backup.

34:11.888 --> 34:13.922
(ALARM SOUNDING)

34:15.757 --> 34:17.891
RIOT GUARD:
Move! Move! Go! Go!

34:38.946 --> 34:42.382
This operation is much bigger
than you think.

34:42.384 --> 34:44.384
Duncan isn't the boss.
Neither am I.

34:44.386 --> 34:47.585
We're both just cogs in a larger,
more powerful machine.

34:47.588 --> 34:49.588
- What are you saying?
- There's no way out.

34:50.656 --> 34:53.324
If the President doesn't die, we do.

34:53.327 --> 34:58.029
You, me, Duncan, your family.

34:58.031 --> 35:00.165
Killing Duncan is a terrible mistake.

35:00.167 --> 35:03.134
The second he's dead,
my partners will cut their losses

35:03.136 --> 35:05.503
and slaughter each
and every one of us.

35:25.817 --> 35:28.018
What are you doing here?

35:28.020 --> 35:30.854
I just got a call from a lady at the
Department of Social Services, okay?

35:30.856 --> 35:33.623
She wants to talk to me.
About us.

35:33.625 --> 35:35.558
Our relationship.

35:35.560 --> 35:38.061
- What the hell's going on, Morgan?
- I have no idea.

35:38.063 --> 35:39.061
Listen.

35:40.197 --> 35:45.468
Okay, what happened?
Is someone abusing you?

35:45.470 --> 35:48.437
That's what this is about?
Who did this to you, Morgan?

35:48.439 --> 35:50.639
Come on, Morgan.
We need to go.

36:08.556 --> 36:10.124
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

36:18.665 --> 36:19.999
Pick up. Pick up.

36:23.237 --> 36:25.304
This is Brian.
Please leave a message.

36:25.306 --> 36:26.392
Brian, it's me.

36:26.462 --> 36:28.539
I just met with the guy we were
talking about this morning, my lawyer.

36:31.311 --> 36:32.578
Just... I'll explain everything later,

36:32.580 --> 36:35.147
but call me back, as soon
as you can, okay? Bye.

36:39.685 --> 36:40.852
(TIRES SQUEALING)

36:44.390 --> 36:45.823
When did she leave?

36:46.959 --> 36:48.993
You're sure
she understands the situation?

36:52.830 --> 36:55.433
Okay. Thanks for the update.

37:00.972 --> 37:03.407
Do you know where
your wife was today?

37:03.409 --> 37:05.057
She was with the President.
That's all I know.

37:05.132 --> 37:06.758
That's all you know?

37:07.178 --> 37:09.579
I told you,
we don't talk very much.

37:09.581 --> 37:11.013
(BRIAN GRUNTING)

37:11.015 --> 37:13.516
She's still very upset
about Samantha.

37:13.518 --> 37:17.420
- I thought we were on the same page.
- We are, I swear.

37:17.422 --> 37:21.257
I'll just finish this up.
A fresh coat of paint.

37:21.259 --> 37:23.292
It'll be like nothing ever happened.

37:23.294 --> 37:27.563
I'm trying to help you.
You understand that?

37:27.565 --> 37:32.033
I do. I swear to God.
I'm with you on this. I want to move on.

37:32.035 --> 37:34.136
Work with you.

37:34.138 --> 37:37.372
Just gotta get Ellen to understand
that it's okay.

37:37.374 --> 37:39.840
To do something horrible
to save our family.

37:42.844 --> 37:44.878
I don't know how longer
I can do this.

37:46.881 --> 37:49.250
- Are you...
- Sober as a judge, Dad.

37:50.486 --> 37:52.920
Have been for two years,
in case you're interested.

37:54.455 --> 37:55.922
Then what is it?

37:59.693 --> 38:01.728
I just found out, uh...

38:01.730 --> 38:05.098
that this guy died.
I saw it on the news.

38:05.100 --> 38:07.166
What the hell are you talking about?

38:07.901 --> 38:10.969
(STAMMERING)
I killed him.

38:10.971 --> 38:15.508
Tell me what happened.
I need to know the facts.

38:15.510 --> 38:18.144
I had to get Sandrine cash.

38:19.679 --> 38:22.181
Otherwise, she was gonna leave.

38:22.183 --> 38:23.782
I was trying to help Duncan.

38:24.851 --> 38:26.917
So we robbed a poker game.

38:28.254 --> 38:33.158
- That's where the incident occurred?
- No. On the street. Outside.

38:33.160 --> 38:35.160
When we were trying to get away.

38:35.162 --> 38:37.529
This guy came at us.
He pulled a gun.

38:38.730 --> 38:40.265
And I hit him.

38:40.267 --> 38:44.034
Was it a residential area? Commercial?
Did you see any video cameras?

38:44.036 --> 38:46.637
It was, uh, residential.

38:46.639 --> 38:49.640
I don't... I didn't see any cameras.
I'm not sure.

38:51.576 --> 38:53.405
You're gonna be fine.

38:53.824 --> 38:56.643
Just keep your mouth shut.
No matter what.

38:56.678 --> 38:58.181
Don't say a word to anyone.

38:59.916 --> 39:01.884
Look, son.

39:01.886 --> 39:03.386
You gotta move on.

39:03.388 --> 39:06.222
It was self-defense.
You did the right thing.

39:06.224 --> 39:07.956
Did the right thing? Really?

39:07.958 --> 39:11.360
We're holding a family hostage,
we killed an innocent nurse because she...

39:11.362 --> 39:13.496
Pull yourself together!

39:13.498 --> 39:16.998
There's no time for all this.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.737
What happened the other night
with that man, it's over.

39:19.778 --> 39:21.961
Done. Put it behind you.

39:22.705 --> 39:25.273
You need to stay strong.

39:25.275 --> 39:26.741
For Nina.

39:26.743 --> 39:28.810
- Hey.
- ARCHER: Everything worked out.

39:28.812 --> 39:32.158
That, uh, problem we had...
It went away.

39:32.243 --> 39:34.276
Meeting's been canceled.

39:35.650 --> 39:38.519
- Good to hear.
- So I'm ready to come home.

39:38.521 --> 39:41.454
- The sooner the better.
- I'll make the call.

39:52.199 --> 39:54.600
Give me a bourbon, please.
Neat.

40:19.324 --> 40:20.891
I thought you don't drink.

40:23.528 --> 40:24.895
I don't.

40:24.897 --> 40:26.096
Then why start?

40:29.268 --> 40:30.901
You're gonna be okay.

40:31.936 --> 40:33.671
We're gonna be okay.

40:35.373 --> 40:37.741
You don't really believe that,
do you?

41:16.044 --> 41:17.712
Let's get out of here.

41:20.949 --> 41:23.016
Kramer Delaney?

41:23.018 --> 41:25.209
Detective Fritz, DC Homicide.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.610
I'd like to discuss
the death of Tim Grace.

41:27.790 --> 41:29.070
Who?

41:29.107 --> 41:31.465
He's a limo driver.
He was killed Saturday night.

41:31.500 --> 41:33.212
Never heard of him.
Why do you wanna talk to me?

41:33.247 --> 41:35.651
I can explain downtown.

41:48.342 --> 41:50.045
All right, we're done.

41:50.081 --> 41:52.791
Do you want me
to put all this away? Or...

41:57.049 --> 41:59.016
No, I'll take care of it.

42:10.995 --> 42:12.095
Nice job.

42:27.444 --> 42:28.411
Brian?

42:31.682 --> 42:32.849
No, no, no, no, no!

42:38.355 --> 42:40.022
No, no! (GASPING)
