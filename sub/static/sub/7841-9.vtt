02:12.218 --> 02:15.377
Nobody steals
Willie's breakfast!

02:33.824 --> 02:36.838
I must've really tied one on last night.

02:37.473 --> 02:39.238
No more drinking.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.280
6:00 A.M.

02:47.281 --> 02:48.782
Still early enough to sneak

02:48.783 --> 02:50.223
into bed and pretend I actually

02:50.224 --> 02:52.256
got home at 3:00 A.M.

02:53.115 --> 02:53.580
Huh?

02:53.801 --> 02:54.922
Where's Marge?

02:56.001 --> 02:57.774
Hey, kids, have you
seen your mother?

03:00.232 --> 03:02.163
Or yourselves?

03:04.249 --> 03:05.172
Maggie?!

03:05.566 --> 03:07.483
Has anyone seen anyone?!

03:07.488 --> 03:08.551
Oh, of course,

03:08.558 --> 03:11.283
they must all be taking a family bath.

03:11.487 --> 03:13.173
Without me!

03:13.668 --> 03:15.882
Save some suds for....

03:15.986 --> 03:17.351
Daddy.

03:17.878 --> 03:19.840
Hey, boy know where the family is?

03:19.856 --> 03:21.233
Show me on MapQuest.

03:22.787 --> 03:24.793
Fine. Google Maps.

03:27.468 --> 03:28.741
What's going on?

03:28.745 --> 03:30.271
Why are you attacking me?

03:30.305 --> 03:32.641
Look, if this is about me
eating your heart pills,

03:32.647 --> 03:35.370
they shouldn't have made them
in Good 'N' Plenty colors.

03:38.478 --> 03:41.291
Moe, my family's gone,
my dog hates me,

03:41.296 --> 03:43.242
and I can't remember what happened last night.

03:43.247 --> 03:44.172
Was I here?

03:44.177 --> 03:45.160
Was you ever.

03:45.206 --> 03:47.992
You came in saying you really
needed to forget something;

03:47.996 --> 03:50.701
so mixed you up the
most powerful drink I got

03:50.717 --> 03:52.422
the "Forget-Me-Shot."

03:52.465 --> 03:54.710
A "Forget-Me-Shot?" Never heard of it.

03:54.717 --> 03:56.052
Yeah, that means it worked.

03:56.057 --> 03:57.270
No one ever remembers.

03:57.276 --> 04:00.521
That's why I made this video
to explain the process.

04:01.216 --> 04:03.662
You start with a splash
of Jagermeister...

04:03.675 --> 04:05.483
- then add sloe gin...
- Got that.

04:05.487 --> 04:06.483
- Triple-Sec...
- Right.

04:06.488 --> 04:07.811
- Quadruple-Sec...
- Yeah.

04:07.816 --> 04:09.120
gunk from a dog's eye,

04:09.136 --> 04:10.502
Absolut Pickle...

04:10.508 --> 04:11.653
Mmm, pickle.

04:11.658 --> 04:13.330
...the red stripe from Aquafresh,

04:13.477 --> 04:15.033
and the funniest ingredient...

04:15.036 --> 04:18.011
the venom of the Louisiana Loboto-moth.

04:18.178 --> 04:19.833
Come on, sweetie.

04:23.827 --> 04:25.831
You stir it with a
home pregnancy test

04:25.837 --> 04:27.520
till it turns positive...

04:28.246 --> 04:29.642
And presto :

04:29.735 --> 04:31.123
the Forget-Me-Shot.

04:32.726 --> 04:34.163
Jeez, I don't look like that.

04:39.858 --> 04:40.921
The point is,

04:40.926 --> 04:43.253
this drink is the
ultimate brain bleacher.

04:43.256 --> 04:46.333
One swig wipes out the
last day of your life.

04:46.337 --> 04:48.031
Give me one of those forget-me drinks!

04:48.037 --> 04:49.852
I made a mistake I gotta wipe out.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.532
I was trying to do a
Don Rickles about Arabs,

04:52.538 --> 04:55.623
but it turned into a
Mel Gibson about Mexicans.

05:00.667 --> 05:01.401
Huh?

05:01.556 --> 05:02.892
What the hell am I doing here?

05:02.896 --> 05:04.962
I gotta get back to
the Latin Grammys.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.213
- There he is! Get him!
- Kill him!

05:09.217 --> 05:10.841
Hot-sauce his eyes!

05:12.415 --> 05:13.951
Oh, my God.

05:13.956 --> 05:15.920
Why would I want to wipe out my memory?!

05:15.928 --> 05:17.870
What horrible
thing did I do?!

05:17.875 --> 05:19.972
You don't remember, huh?

05:19.987 --> 05:23.323
There was a domestic disturbance
at your address yesterday.

05:25.218 --> 05:26.951
Chief Wiggum!

05:26.957 --> 05:29.461
I remember seeing you...

05:32.708 --> 05:34.222
What's going on here, Simpson?

05:34.226 --> 05:36.022
Am I gonna need the zip strips?

05:36.026 --> 05:37.903
Everything's fine

05:37.915 --> 05:39.962
cupcakes and sprinkles.

05:39.977 --> 05:40.702
I see.

05:40.705 --> 05:42.160
And how did you get that?

05:42.455 --> 05:43.553
What gives, Simpson?

05:43.558 --> 05:45.203
Giving your wife an Irish kiss?

05:45.206 --> 05:46.453
No, I swear!

05:46.457 --> 05:48.380
It was my fault. I...

05:48.685 --> 05:50.393
I walked into a door.

05:50.397 --> 05:51.830
Walked into a door, huh?

05:51.838 --> 05:54.493
That is the lamest excuse I ever...

05:55.168 --> 05:56.172
All right, door!

05:56.175 --> 05:57.782
You're coming downtown!

06:00.788 --> 06:02.993
Marge had a black eye?

06:02.997 --> 06:05.832
I could never do
something like that.

06:06.055 --> 06:06.852
Could I?

06:06.857 --> 06:08.992
Why don't you ask the person
who filed the complaint?

06:08.998 --> 06:11.370
Not that I am authorized to
release that information...

06:11.376 --> 06:11.930
Flanders!

06:11.937 --> 06:12.983
Fine, it was Flanders.

06:12.986 --> 06:14.433
Now, since you know everything,

06:14.438 --> 06:15.473
who was Jack the Ripper?

06:15.477 --> 06:17.240
The queen's private surgeon!

06:18.476 --> 06:21.032
Flanders, why did you
call the cops last night?

06:21.066 --> 06:23.150
I had to--I heard a hubbub, Bub.

06:23.296 --> 06:25.312
What did I do?!

06:25.317 --> 06:27.531
I can't say for sure,
but as a Christian,

06:27.537 --> 06:29.083
I assume the worst.

06:30.137 --> 06:32.563
What happened in this room?!

06:32.566 --> 06:34.470
If only these walls could talk.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.893
People would pay to come
see my amazing talking walls,

06:37.897 --> 06:39.651
and I could use that money to...

06:39.657 --> 06:41.202
Hey, a memory!

06:44.898 --> 06:46.850
Stop! Homer, please!

06:48.086 --> 06:49.393
My eye!

06:52.648 --> 06:54.030
No, it can't be!

06:54.038 --> 06:55.543
I would never hurt Marge!

06:55.546 --> 06:56.842
I'm a good man!

06:56.858 --> 06:58.581
Yeah, yeah, me too!

07:00.805 --> 07:03.132
You know, doing this
is just confirming a

07:03.135 --> 07:04.943
stereotype for you Mexicans.

07:04.947 --> 07:06.503
I am from Costa Rica!

07:06.507 --> 07:08.022
And I should care because?

07:12.317 --> 07:15.093
Thank goodness you
come to visit me, son!

07:15.095 --> 07:17.753
I can't take one more
minute of this high school

07:17.758 --> 07:20.131
glee club pretending they
don't hate being here.

07:20.138 --> 07:22.423
Oh, what a night

07:22.438 --> 07:26.960
<i>You know I didn't even know her name</i>

07:27.025 --> 07:31.653
<i>But I was never gonna be the same</i>

07:31.657 --> 07:35.461
<i>What a lady
What a night...</i>

07:36.727 --> 07:40.011
You'll eat our cookies,
but you won't look at us!

07:41.465 --> 07:43.600
Dad, I can't remember
what I did last night.

07:43.608 --> 07:45.230
Do you have any idea?

07:45.318 --> 07:48.030
You come to me
for help rememberin'?

07:48.038 --> 07:50.622
That's like asking your
horse to do your taxes,

07:50.625 --> 07:52.902
which I did back in 1998.

07:54.185 --> 07:55.750
I'm afraid I did something

07:55.757 --> 07:57.672
to make Marge and the kids leave me.

07:57.736 --> 07:58.353
Wait.

07:58.358 --> 08:00.213
I know someone who can help you

08:00.216 --> 08:03.600
a doctor who helps people
dig up old memories.

08:03.606 --> 08:04.302
Really?

08:04.307 --> 08:05.673
Oh, that's great, Dad.

08:05.726 --> 08:07.282
How can I ever repay you?

08:07.286 --> 08:08.923
Punch that orderly who takes

08:08.926 --> 08:10.390
sips out of my juice.

08:10.958 --> 08:11.501
Done.

08:15.545 --> 08:16.530
No, wait.

08:16.531 --> 08:18.452
That's the guy that
saved my life.

08:18.631 --> 08:19.924
Memory Recivery Institute
we do not do MRI's

08:20.322 --> 08:22.993
Mr. Simpson, I have built
a device that will enable

08:22.999 --> 08:25.111
you to explore your memories.

08:25.115 --> 08:26.623
The science was easy,

08:26.625 --> 08:28.180
but now I've got the hard part,

08:28.185 --> 08:29.190
coming up with a name.

08:29.197 --> 08:31.111
How about The Deja View-Master?

08:31.115 --> 08:31.803
Uh...

08:31.805 --> 08:33.591
Remembrance of things fast?
Hmm.

08:33.595 --> 08:34.892
The Remembererer?

08:34.897 --> 08:36.482
We don't have to come up with it now.

08:40.585 --> 08:43.451
These wonderful wrinkle-bags
are reliving their

08:43.467 --> 08:45.872
cherished memories of yesteryear.

08:46.086 --> 08:48.361
Ah, my first Christmas.

08:48.367 --> 08:50.601
Such great Chinese food.

08:50.605 --> 08:51.672
This is great!

08:51.675 --> 08:54.322
I'm finally gonna find
out how I ruined my family!

08:54.326 --> 08:55.451
Strap me in, nerd!

08:55.457 --> 08:57.552
To me, "nerd" stands for

08:57.557 --> 09:00.263
Not Even Remotely Dorky,
so thank you.

09:00.265 --> 09:01.430
Thank you for the compliment.

09:01.718 --> 09:03.551
Now you'll feel a slight pinch,

09:03.557 --> 09:06.093
followed by an extremely painful pinch,

09:06.098 --> 09:08.763
signaling that the
spike will begin boring

09:08.766 --> 09:10.861
into your skull three seconds later.

09:10.868 --> 09:11.853
Boring.

09:11.865 --> 09:12.703
Yes, that's right, boring.

09:12.705 --> 09:13.020
Ow!

09:13.287 --> 09:13.782
Ow!

09:13.905 --> 09:14.422
Ow!

09:14.467 --> 09:15.541
Three, two, one.

09:20.815 --> 09:22.262
What the hell?

09:23.877 --> 09:25.890
Your memory bubble and you

09:26.427 --> 09:29.553
"This bubble allows you to view
any past event from your life."

09:30.126 --> 09:33.410
Ah, it's got that new bubble smell.

09:35.175 --> 09:38.010
Aw, I landed in a pleasant memory.

09:38.018 --> 09:40.392
Look at happy me and playful them.

09:40.406 --> 09:42.181
And we're off!

09:42.187 --> 09:45.012
Now remember-steer into the sculptures.

09:45.505 --> 09:47.190
Snow sculpture contest

09:58.307 --> 10:01.823
Oh, I miss those by gone
days of earlier this week.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.661
But I'm needed in a darker place.

10:23.856 --> 10:24.903
Wha...?

10:24.907 --> 10:27.233
Those squeaks sound like couch springs

10:27.238 --> 10:29.491
grooving to the beat of love!

10:32.418 --> 10:33.001
Hmm?

10:33.067 --> 10:33.880
Homer!

10:33.888 --> 10:36.420
I wasn't expecting you.

10:39.215 --> 10:41.303
Hey, what's going on here?!

10:41.305 --> 10:45.112
Oh, Homer, I didn't want
you to find out this way.

10:45.115 --> 10:46.180
Another man...

10:46.185 --> 10:47.010
with my wife...

10:47.015 --> 10:47.900
in my house...

10:47.915 --> 10:50.310
on top of my TV Guide?!

10:52.077 --> 10:53.793
I got to find out who that guy is,

10:53.795 --> 10:54.900
but I need help.

10:55.008 --> 10:56.521
Someone like Bart,

10:56.697 --> 10:58.101
only smart.

10:58.448 --> 10:59.351
Lisa!

11:06.166 --> 11:07.031
Another me!

11:07.166 --> 11:08.390
You can watch the kids.

11:08.945 --> 11:12.471
Lisa, I'm about to probe the most
shattering moment of my life.

11:12.676 --> 11:13.542
You want to join me?

11:13.617 --> 11:14.421
Might as well.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.273
You're getting this memory mixed
up with a commercial you saw.

11:17.555 --> 11:18.972
With new Synergy Wireless,

11:18.977 --> 11:20.791
night time minutes start at 6:30,

11:21.008 --> 11:23.541
and you get four free d-cast
downloads per month.

11:23.758 --> 11:25.743
Synergy--
it's your call.

11:26.158 --> 11:29.393
<i>It's a beautiful morning</i>

11:32.456 --> 11:37.072
<i>I think I'll go outside for a while...</i>

11:37.928 --> 11:39.541
Yo, Homer, can you take me to when were

11:39.547 --> 11:40.991
ten to see if I can kick your butt?

11:41.306 --> 11:42.251
Bring it on.

11:46.078 --> 11:48.413
You're superior to me in every way!

11:49.865 --> 11:52.591
Well, let's see how you do
against 20-year-old Homer.

11:54.986 --> 11:56.571
What is it you want from me?

11:56.738 --> 11:58.481
Money? Weed? D'oh!

11:59.077 --> 12:01.112
I'll teach you to beat up yester-me!

12:08.976 --> 12:11.511
Dad, you just destroyed
your first kiss.

12:11.725 --> 12:12.642
Who was it with?

12:12.777 --> 12:14.350
Uh... Apu.

12:14.528 --> 12:15.490
Right.

12:23.506 --> 12:25.521
Kids, your mom is
with another man,

12:25.675 --> 12:27.501
and I need you
to help me find out who he is.

12:27.797 --> 12:30.333
Hmm. Is this really something
I should show you kids?

12:30.486 --> 12:32.210
It's okay. We're not really your kids.

12:32.396 --> 12:35.342
We're just representations of
them that you created in your mind.

12:35.576 --> 12:38.120
Really? Then if I created all this,

12:38.335 --> 12:40.963
that means I can have pizza
anytime I want!

12:42.516 --> 12:44.851
Hello. I'd like to order a pizza.

12:45.358 --> 12:46.791
35 minutes?!

12:50.445 --> 12:52.190
Hey, what's going on here?!

12:52.306 --> 12:53.903
See? That's where my memory stops.

12:54.366 --> 12:56.071
Who the heck is that guy?

12:56.245 --> 12:57.581
What if you just moved the bottle?

12:57.737 --> 12:59.753
All right. Let me just
get out of this bubble

12:59.886 --> 13:01.752
smoothly and elegantly.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.801
How can I get my memory to work?

13:12.257 --> 13:14.000
Declarative memory can be broken

13:14.005 --> 13:14.931
into two subsets:

13:15.087 --> 13:16.681
the episodic forms are stored

13:16.685 --> 13:17.610
in the neocortex,

13:17.755 --> 13:19.213
while the semantic ones are...

13:19.305 --> 13:20.200
Oh, can that tuna!

13:20.317 --> 13:22.050
We can get your brain
to work the same way

13:22.156 --> 13:24.232
you always get the TV
to work --by hitting it.

13:33.515 --> 13:35.350
Hey, what's going on here?

13:35.565 --> 13:39.081
Oh, Homer, I didn't want you
to find out this way.

13:40.956 --> 13:42.952
- Duffman!
- Duffman?

13:43.737 --> 13:44.713
Duffman!

13:45.167 --> 13:46.830
The mother of my children

13:46.837 --> 13:48.963
with the reason for my children!

13:49.136 --> 13:51.102
Stop, Homer! Please!

13:51.338 --> 13:53.150
I'm just giving it to your wife.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.481
She is gonna be sore tomorrow.

13:55.616 --> 13:56.930
No!

13:58.117 --> 13:59.841
Your stupid invention made me

13:59.846 --> 14:01.561
realize my life is worthless!

14:01.787 --> 14:04.230
Well, if you can't stand
the neural activity,

14:04.418 --> 14:06.072
stay out of the neural activator!

14:07.626 --> 14:10.591
So I did have butter
nut squash last night.

14:13.096 --> 14:14.460
My wife left me.

14:14.577 --> 14:17.492
I've done horrible things.
My family's gone.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.493
My life is ruined.

14:21.127 --> 14:23.291
Good-bye, cruel world!

14:25.956 --> 14:28.021
And good-bye, Cruller World.

14:28.156 --> 14:29.671
Bye, Homer!

14:31.685 --> 14:34.062
Suicide Bridge
in memory of governor Chester L. Suicide

14:36.976 --> 14:39.003
Are you my guardian angel?

14:39.985 --> 14:41.181
Yes, we are.

14:41.357 --> 14:43.050
Jump and we'll carry you to Heaven.

14:43.238 --> 14:46.601
Hey, aren't trolls supposed
to be under the bridge?

14:46.937 --> 14:48.150
Ha, ha, good-bye.

14:49.187 --> 14:50.701
Come on, what are you waiting for?

14:50.907 --> 14:53.230
We want to see if the splash
reaches the moon.

14:54.188 --> 14:55.682
- Good one.
- Wait a minute.

14:55.808 --> 14:57.882
If killing myself
would make you two happy,

14:58.005 --> 14:59.000
then I'm not gonna do it.

14:59.105 --> 15:00.873
Don't worry about our happiness.

15:01.008 --> 15:02.671
For once, think of yourself.

15:06.938 --> 15:08.770
My life's flashing before my eyes.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.343
A life well-lived.

16:13.675 --> 16:14.792
Until last night.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.540
I guess I'll have
to watch that now.

16:21.455 --> 16:23.270
What's going on here?!

16:23.445 --> 16:24.572
Oh, Homer,

16:24.697 --> 16:26.943
I didn't want you
to find out this way.

16:27.146 --> 16:29.943
We were planning
a surprise party for you.

16:30.125 --> 16:32.150
A surprise party?!

16:33.455 --> 16:35.651
This magic marker's
running out of ink.

16:37.495 --> 16:40.181
I'm sorry your surprise party
was spoiled.

16:40.346 --> 16:41.460
Are you kidding?

16:41.745 --> 16:43.312
The mother of my children

16:43.317 --> 16:45.310
with the reason for my children!

16:45.497 --> 16:47.780
This is gonna be the
greatest party ever!

16:48.267 --> 16:49.260
Oh, yeah!

16:49.517 --> 16:51.263
Duff beer is sponsoring the party,

16:51.437 --> 16:53.490
featuring new Duff Champagne

16:53.506 --> 16:55.190
the beer of champagnes!

16:55.565 --> 16:56.942
Oh, my God!

16:57.088 --> 16:59.963
It's like Christmas in December.
Let's celebrate now.

17:00.865 --> 17:02.811
Stop, Homer! Please!

17:03.798 --> 17:04.891
My eye!

17:06.935 --> 17:08.482
Don't worry, honey.
I'll get you an ice pack.

17:08.845 --> 17:09.882
Where's the ice pack?

17:10.087 --> 17:11.811
I'm just giving it to your wife.

17:12.066 --> 17:14.213
She is gonna be sore tomorrow.

17:16.088 --> 17:18.733
So Marge wasn't cheating on me;

17:18.867 --> 17:20.910
I never hit her; and my family

17:20.917 --> 17:23.090
is throwing me an awesome party.

17:24.487 --> 17:26.281
Thank God I figured it out

17:26.288 --> 17:28.291
before I did anything stupid.

17:30.488 --> 17:31.363
Oh, right.

17:36.698 --> 17:38.241
Oh, my God! I'm not dead!

17:40.986 --> 17:43.091
Homie, this is your party!

17:44.847 --> 17:46.092
This is great!

17:46.218 --> 17:48.311
I must be the first
gullible husband

17:48.398 --> 17:51.380
to overhear snippets
of surprise party planning

17:51.578 --> 17:54.373
and think it was my wife
having an affair.

17:59.995 --> 18:03.541
Keep it up, people.
The night is young!

18:05.097 --> 18:06.623
Um, it's 11:00.

18:06.826 --> 18:08.222
You want to pay for the extra hour?

18:08.405 --> 18:09.200
Okay.

18:10.995 --> 18:12.421
Par-tay, people!

18:12.845 --> 18:15.402
Geez, Homer, I can't believe
your plan actually worked.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.350
What plan?

18:16.505 --> 18:18.142
Your plan to make the surprise party

18:18.148 --> 18:19.372
a surprise again. Remember?

18:23.815 --> 18:26.181
Marge put so much work
into that party.

18:26.486 --> 18:28.491
The least I could do is be surprised.

18:28.787 --> 18:31.192
If only I could forget
what happened today.

18:31.398 --> 18:33.692
I got just the drink
to wipe your mind clean:

18:33.897 --> 18:34.891
the "Forget-Me-Shot."

18:35.098 --> 18:37.082
Fellas, if you got anything you
want to say to Homer

18:37.165 --> 18:39.061
that he'll never remember, say it now.

18:39.565 --> 18:40.812
Blue pants make you look fat.

18:40.915 --> 18:42.131
I've never learned your kids' names.

18:42.437 --> 18:43.290
Your yard is unkempt.

18:43.515 --> 18:44.981
It is obvious you're bald.

18:45.146 --> 18:46.313
Your thighs make noise.

18:46.485 --> 18:48.260
I find your small hands attractive.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.441
I've spit in every drink
I ever served you.

18:51.246 --> 18:52.461
Bottoms up!

18:53.926 --> 18:55.022
The only problem is,

18:55.155 --> 18:57.282
I'm sure to retain some image
of coming home

18:57.408 --> 18:59.032
and finding Duffman.

18:59.307 --> 19:01.761
No doubt I'll misconstrue
that as him

19:01.767 --> 19:04.282
placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow.

19:04.507 --> 19:06.851
And that will make me
want to jump off a...

19:07.455 --> 19:08.270
For the love of God,

19:08.337 --> 19:10.352
make sure the party boat
has a moon bounce.

19:10.528 --> 19:11.401
Okay.

19:15.228 --> 19:17.052
I'm a genius.

19:17.287 --> 19:19.622
But there are still a few things
I don't understand.

19:19.855 --> 19:21.920
Like why did Marge lie to Chief Wiggum

19:21.926 --> 19:23.723
about how she got that black eye?

19:23.936 --> 19:26.721
Because I didn't want him
finding out about the party.

19:26.978 --> 19:28.423
I mean, he's okay,

19:28.657 --> 19:30.223
but you know he'd bring Sarah,

19:30.485 --> 19:32.622
and I just don't care for that woman.

19:32.908 --> 19:34.520
And when you pushed
me off the bridge,

19:34.776 --> 19:36.433
it's 'cause you knew about the party

19:36.436 --> 19:38.050
and wanted to make sure I got here.

19:38.426 --> 19:39.650
Yeah, that must be it.

19:39.957 --> 19:42.701
You know, there's an after-party
at the bottom of the ocean.

19:42.935 --> 19:44.601
This is good for two free drinks.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.970
The only thing that still
doesn't make sense is

19:48.155 --> 19:50.221
why the dog attacked me.

19:50.536 --> 19:51.650
Because you never feed him,

19:51.887 --> 19:53.530
walk him or let him out to pee.

19:56.486 --> 19:57.780
Who's an angry dog?

19:58.177 --> 19:59.481
Who's an angry dog?

19:59.678 --> 20:01.922
Now who wants a beer?

20:07.345 --> 20:09.501
To a man I'm happy to call

20:09.505 --> 20:11.910
my best friend, Homer Simpsno!

20:12.127 --> 20:13.070
Simpson!

20:13.248 --> 20:15.943
Dyslexia, Duffman's secret shame.

20:20.977 --> 20:22.313
Aren't you going to drink?

20:22.595 --> 20:26.111
No, this is a moment
I want to remember.

20:26.827 --> 20:33.711
<i>I remember finding out about you...</i>

20:36.996 --> 20:43.010
<i>Every day my mind is all around you</i>

20:45.825 --> 20:49.462
<i>Looking out from my lonely room</i>

20:49.745 --> 20:54.070
<i>I give my love to you.</i>
