00:05.960 --> 00:07.640
<i>Greetings from Suleiman Isa.</i>

00:29.480 --> 00:30.600
Kukoo?

01:26.720 --> 01:28.040
<i>Kukoo's gone.</i>

01:29.200 --> 01:30.400
<i>What do you mean, "gone"?</i>

01:32.760 --> 01:35.080
Meaning fuck all. Nothing.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.960
I'm Ganesh Gaitonde. I don't trust anyone.

01:50.520 --> 01:54.080
Even he can't harm me
because I'm above him.

01:56.360 --> 02:00.960
From now on, only one god
will be worshiped in Gopalmath,

02:01.040 --> 02:01.960
and that's me.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.840
I'm your one true god.

03:45.560 --> 03:49.640
-How did you find out about this?
-I had a dream. Mind your own business.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.120
We have to get to him
before the RAW officers do.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.840
Why are you doing this?
Is it because you like her?

04:01.320 --> 04:04.320
Bunty won't give in easily.
There'll be gunfire.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.560
Should I teach you
how to take the safety off the gun?

04:07.640 --> 04:10.680
I'll Google it,
just like I Googled Ramakant Jadhav.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.760
-Who are these people?
-They're our men.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.040
Criminals turned informants.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.800
If things go wrong,
we'll say we got a tip from them...

04:31.680 --> 04:35.200
that they were blackmailing a builder
and got away with six lakh rupees.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.960
-What's this?
-It's for your protection.

04:39.720 --> 04:44.760
They fired, and we fired in response.
We don't know anything about Bunty.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.000
You got it?

05:24.240 --> 05:25.120
Go, go, go.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.080
What the fuck?

05:38.640 --> 05:41.480
-This wasn't the plan.
-Just go and save the lady.

05:41.560 --> 05:42.400
Asshole. Yes, sir.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.640
It's done.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.800
Ma'am, he's found out.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.720
<i>-Who?</i>
-Sartaj.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.200
Where are they? I don't know.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.320
What the fuck?

07:00.960 --> 07:02.280
Motherfucker.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.200
Sir.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.760
Come on, come on.

07:45.640 --> 07:46.800
Stop!

08:01.440 --> 08:05.240
You rotten fucker.
What are you doing here?

08:10.520 --> 08:12.520
You started this whole game, right?

08:12.600 --> 08:14.680
Why are you ruining everything?

08:14.880 --> 08:17.200
Let go of Nayanika. I'll save you.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.760
What will you do after saving me?

08:19.320 --> 08:20.440
Throw me in jail?

08:20.840 --> 08:22.920
-Let her go!
-You let her go!

08:23.000 --> 08:25.320
Your obsession will get you in trouble.

08:25.880 --> 08:26.720
Get out of here.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.960
Don't come any closer, Sartaj.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.480
If you shoot,
we'll riddle you with bullets.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.640
There will be nothing left of you.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.559
Anjali Mathur is calling.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.560
Ma'am, what the fuck is going on?

08:45.080 --> 08:46.360
What is Sartaj doing?

08:46.480 --> 08:48.840
Listen, let me talk to him.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.440
Talk.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.160
Sartaj, get out of there.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.240
<i>Clear the way.</i>

08:56.240 --> 08:59.360
You got it? Clear the way. Come on.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.440
Get out.

09:01.680 --> 09:02.760
Back off, Sartaj!

09:03.720 --> 09:06.560
Why are you fucking with my plan?

09:06.640 --> 09:09.240
Get the fuck out, or you'll die.

09:09.320 --> 09:12.040
Why are you all just standing there?
Get him out of here!

09:33.600 --> 09:35.360
Come on, we don't have time!

09:47.400 --> 09:48.960
We're almost there. Get the car, fast!

10:30.440 --> 10:32.560
<i>The difficult times came without warning.</i>

10:33.800 --> 10:35.120
<i>That's how things were.</i>

10:36.240 --> 10:38.360
<i>This was the feeling all over the country.</i>

10:38.440 --> 10:41.160
<i>The home minister's daughter</i>
<i>was kidnapped in Kashmir.</i>

10:42.000 --> 10:45.600
<i>Kids in Delhi set themselves on fire</i>
<i>in the name of the Mandal Commission.</i>

10:45.680 --> 10:48.760
<i>Prime ministers were changed</i>
<i>as often as underwear.</i>

10:49.480 --> 10:53.280
<i>But I was not going to let</i>
<i>Gopalmath slip away so easily.</i>

10:55.080 --> 10:57.760
<i>First, I banned alcohol in the gang.</i>

10:58.560 --> 11:01.320
<i>This pissed everyone off.</i>

11:02.600 --> 11:06.440
<i>Then I vowed to kill 50 of Isa's men</i>
<i>within a month.</i>

11:07.480 --> 11:08.720
<i>Abdul in the Irani Hotel.</i>

11:08.840 --> 11:10.720
How are you, bro? All well?

11:13.800 --> 11:15.000
<i>Rajab Rangeela in Khajur Gully.</i>

11:17.720 --> 11:18.800
<i>Ismail in Nagpada.</i>

11:28.000 --> 11:28.920
Come on.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.040
<i>Ajju, Vicky and Sufi in the factory.</i>

11:49.280 --> 11:50.800
<i>But none of them were important.</i>

11:51.360 --> 11:53.080
<i>I couldn't kill anyone</i>
<i>who mattered to Isa.</i>

11:53.560 --> 11:56.400
<i>Isa went to Dubai with his family.</i>

11:57.360 --> 12:02.160
<i>Mr. Paritosh was convinced that all this</i>
<i>had happened because of bad fortune.</i> Your stars... they aren't favoring you.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.040
I mean, Saturn is interfering.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.960
You know, Saturn's planetary period...

12:14.400 --> 12:15.800
when its rule begins...

12:17.720 --> 12:18.760
everything is fucked.

12:20.160 --> 12:23.800
Mr. Paritosh told me
that this ring will fix everything.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.640
Put a ring on a baby
as soon as it's born...

12:27.400 --> 12:29.000
and don't worry about a thing.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.560
Mess things up...

12:33.120 --> 12:36.040
and this fucking ring will fix it all.

12:36.800 --> 12:40.280
Hasn't this war between
you and Isa gone on for too long?

12:41.600 --> 12:43.760
Isa's being fucked by us.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.160
No asshole has been spared.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.560
All of them are bleeding.

12:48.640 --> 12:52.400
<i>We have also shed a lot of blood,</i>
<i>but you don't see it.</i>

12:53.600 --> 12:56.520
Come, give your condolences.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.640
In the name of God,
the merciful and compassionate.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.840
<i>When was the last time</i>
<i>you spent time with your boys?</i>

13:06.920 --> 13:09.200
Just hung out and had fun?

13:09.440 --> 13:14.240
Joined Bunty at Badriya's feast
and celebrated Eid with them?

13:14.320 --> 13:17.200
Got Chotta and Bada Badriya to dance
at Bunty's Ganpati festival?

13:17.360 --> 13:20.920
All this used to happen in Gopalmath.
Everyone drank and had a good time.

13:22.760 --> 13:23.680
It doesn't happen now.

13:24.440 --> 13:28.760
Stop thinking with your dick,
or all you'll ever be is an asshole.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.560
There's still time.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.480
Save Gopalmath from getting destroyed.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.720
-Think about it.
<i>-Kanta Bai was right.</i>

13:39.440 --> 13:42.360
<i>After Kukoo died, I was depressed.</i>

13:43.200 --> 13:47.360
<i>I tried to release my frustration in bed,</i>

13:47.440 --> 13:48.560
<i>like a madman.</i>

14:02.200 --> 14:04.720
<i>But whenever I saw a whore</i>
<i>with flowers in her hair...</i>

14:06.280 --> 14:08.320
<i>I would see my mother.</i>

14:12.200 --> 14:13.080
Why did you bring her?

14:16.200 --> 14:19.200
<i>It wasn't just my heart,</i>
<i>my dick was bleeding too.</i>

14:54.720 --> 14:56.680
<i>Mr. Sartaj, strength is something</i>

14:57.280 --> 14:59.280
<i>that comes to you with all its might...</i>

15:00.160 --> 15:02.320
<i>and leaves you empty when it's gone.</i>

15:15.840 --> 15:17.680
<i>Times change rapidly, sir.</i>

15:18.440 --> 15:23.080
<i>The leopard that made me feel alive</i>
<i>became the Grim Reaper.</i>

15:23.920 --> 15:27.800
<i>Whenever I looked in its eyes,</i>
<i>I used to feel like a god.</i>

15:28.560 --> 15:32.920
<i>But when I saw him in the hospital,</i>
<i>I felt hollow.</i>

15:33.960 --> 15:35.320
<i>Empty inside.</i>

15:40.840 --> 15:42.680
You were lucky this time.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.160
Did you put this on me?

15:52.840 --> 15:55.080
You're alive because of this ring.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.160
Since we got you to the hospital...

16:00.920 --> 16:02.440
this has been on your finger.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.240
I know about my death.

16:06.520 --> 16:10.200
-This is not how I will die.
-Who said that you're going to die?

16:11.880 --> 16:12.920
Mr. Paritosh...

16:14.520 --> 16:15.520
let me speak.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.080
Go on.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.280
I want to get married.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.400
To the kind of girl you told me about.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.360
Look for a girl for me.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.720
Careful.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.920
Take him upstairs and let him rest.

17:00.480 --> 17:01.320
Listen.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.440
What's your name? Subhadra.

17:07.720 --> 17:08.560
You...

17:10.960 --> 17:13.079
Did you put this ring on my finger?

17:13.839 --> 17:15.160
To save me?

17:16.920 --> 17:18.240
Can't you speak?

17:19.319 --> 17:21.640
You think you're above God.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.000
That's why he's punishing you.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.280
So you want God to forgive me?

17:37.840 --> 17:38.920
Speak up, bitch.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.440
You don't understand.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.360
You don't understand anything
beyond yourself.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.720
When God punishes you, he punishes me too.

17:50.560 --> 17:53.840
He makes me and my family suffer as well.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.520
Are you crazy, bitch?

17:58.920 --> 17:59.760
Get out.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.880
<i>Isa's ass-licker, Parulkar, gave me a tip.</i>

18:06.240 --> 18:08.640
<i>Usman Sheikh, Isa's accountant.</i>

18:09.280 --> 18:13.960
<i>He was coming from Dubai to Bombay</i>
<i>for his mother's treatment. Alone.</i>

18:14.520 --> 18:17.240
<i>Until then, we had killed</i>
<i>Isa's small-timers.</i>

18:17.480 --> 18:20.240
<i>But Usman... he mattered to Isa,</i>

18:20.640 --> 18:21.480
<i>his shadow.</i>

18:22.040 --> 18:23.600
He'll come here in an airplane...

18:25.360 --> 18:27.040
but will leave in a coffin.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.440
Coff...

18:32.560 --> 18:33.920
What's a coffin?

18:37.360 --> 18:40.680
A coffin is something that
when shoved up your ass,

18:41.600 --> 18:45.240
will attract more tourists
than the Gateway of India. Fucker.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.400
Boss, we'll build a hotel
close to his ass. Call it Ass with a View.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.120
Fucker, keep your diapers on,

18:51.200 --> 18:53.200
or we'll see whose bare ass
will become famous.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.840
-Show me.
-Motherfucker...

19:05.360 --> 19:08.480
Couldn't you find anything better
than this piece of shit?

19:08.560 --> 19:11.960
I saved the good one for your funeral.

19:12.040 --> 19:16.000
Motherfucker!
Do you want to use this to escape?

19:16.080 --> 19:18.160
There's room in your ass for a coffin.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.400
A slight push
and the ambulance will fit in too.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.960
Sure! And you can put
the red light on your dick.

19:23.040 --> 19:26.760
If I put the red light on my dick,
your sister will moan like a siren.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.680
Then you'll call me a sister-fucker.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.840
-Which is true in your case.
-Fucker!

19:53.840 --> 19:56.320
-Pull the fucking trigger.
-Be patient.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.360
Pull the trigger.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.560
Shoot! You fucking...

20:02.320 --> 20:03.560
His mom is in the way.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.280
Shove the mom up your ass.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.480
Motherfucker! Fucking asshole!

20:13.560 --> 20:15.120
Move! Usman Sheikh.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.640
-Hey!
-Oh, God!

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Peace be unto you, ma'am.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.520
Did you kill Usman?

20:37.640 --> 20:40.840
Yes, boss. I sent him to his coffin.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.320
-But, boss...
-What is with you?

20:43.960 --> 20:47.080
Couldn't you muster the courage?

20:49.400 --> 20:51.080
I don't want any problems.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.720
You'll take your sister to the mosque...

21:00.920 --> 21:02.360
and have her marry him.

21:02.920 --> 21:03.760
Boss?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.760
He gives me a watch and says,

21:12.640 --> 21:14.040
"Get your sister married...

21:15.200 --> 21:16.480
to that circumcised pig."

21:17.840 --> 21:19.960
<i>I'll fuck him up.</i>

21:20.920 --> 21:24.200
<i>I'll make him run like a dog for his life.</i>

21:25.240 --> 21:27.480
<i>I'll cut him into pieces.</i> <i>I'll cut him into pieces.</i>

21:32.600 --> 21:34.720
Little pieces.

21:39.760 --> 21:42.880
Hurry up! We don't have much time.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.840
Hey! You dropped it! Pick it up.

21:46.920 --> 21:51.240
-There are very few flowers here.
-Get lost! You're useless.

21:51.320 --> 21:55.200
-Please hurry up. There's a lot to do.
-It will be done.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.480
When, after the wedding? Mikki!

21:57.600 --> 22:00.240
If there are four on top,
then how many will be left for the bottom?

22:00.320 --> 22:02.120
That's why your father threw you out.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.920
You've been thinking about the design...
And what design did you make?

22:05.160 --> 22:07.360
Don't yell on such a special day. -Good that you shaved today.
-Do you need more flowers?

22:20.160 --> 22:21.240
-I'll get it.
-Okay.

22:23.360 --> 22:24.960
-Mr. Paritosh.
<i>-Yes?</i>

22:25.480 --> 22:27.160
We have to call off the wedding.

22:28.160 --> 22:29.120
I don't want it.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.680
Don't worry.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.160
I'll walk with you.

22:36.240 --> 22:39.160
It's a long walk, you'll lose your breath.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.280
Your life is about to change.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.240
<i>Ganesh Gaitonde is about to become Plutus.</i>

22:44.560 --> 22:45.400
I understand. <i>What?</i>

22:47.680 --> 22:49.240
Why you're so happy.

22:50.640 --> 22:54.160
You can already hear the sound of money.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.320
Now shove that up your ass and come here.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.920
<i>I'm sending Bunty to pick you up.</i>

23:00.320 --> 23:02.160
We're ready to leave.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.360
Hey! Who's there?

23:23.520 --> 23:24.640
Come out of there!

23:32.920 --> 23:35.000
You're very dear to Gaitonde, right?

23:37.240 --> 23:39.280
-Who are you?
-I'm from the brothel.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.640
Treat me to something sweet.

23:41.720 --> 23:42.920
Stop bullshitting.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.400
Do you think I own a sweet shop?

23:46.480 --> 23:49.560
Simi told me how you like it.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.760
She taught me how to make you happy.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.360
I can take you to the moon.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.280
-Where's Bunty? Bunty...
-He hasn't come yet.

24:04.840 --> 24:05.760
I don't know. Congratulations.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.760
-Who is this?
-You're lucky you're still breathing.

24:20.680 --> 24:24.200
And I'm lucky that you're still alive
to receive my gift.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.920
-What gift?
-For your wedding.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.400
It's on its way.

24:35.560 --> 24:36.440
Bunty!

24:42.560 --> 24:43.400
What happened?

24:44.040 --> 24:46.240
-Where's Bunty?
-I don't know, boss.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.040
Watch out!

24:58.960 --> 25:01.520
He's driving recklessly! Pass him.

25:01.840 --> 25:02.720
Watch out!

25:06.120 --> 25:07.080
Who are these people?

25:07.640 --> 25:08.880
Who are these people?

26:30.440 --> 26:32.840
The girl and her family left. Should I bring them back?

27:25.360 --> 27:26.360
Call the priest.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.160
I will get married.

27:31.560 --> 27:32.440
To whom?

27:45.560 --> 27:47.760
<i>That day, I decided on three things.</i>

27:47.840 --> 27:52.720
<i>Since Mr. Paritosh died for my marriage,</i>
<i>I'd get married that very same day.</i>

27:53.840 --> 27:56.240
<i>I would avenge his murder.</i>

27:58.000 --> 28:00.760
Boss, he's drunk.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.560
You fucker...

28:03.640 --> 28:04.960
Boss, what happened?

28:05.520 --> 28:06.920
What happened?

28:07.720 --> 28:09.800
What did I do?

28:09.920 --> 28:12.600
You'll be reduced to nothing, dickhead!

28:13.200 --> 28:15.000
-Boss...
-Dirty rat.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.640
Boss! Please, no!

28:18.400 --> 28:22.880
Fucker, if I see you again,
I'll make you suffer.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.120
Motherfucker.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.480
Boss, what did I do?

28:28.160 --> 28:32.000
Go to sleep.
Should I switch off the lights?

28:36.000 --> 28:38.760
<i>And to beat Bunty so badly</i>

28:39.600 --> 28:42.200
<i>that he'd be cursed to die like a dog.</i>

29:18.280 --> 29:20.640
<i>Did you think for a second</i>
<i>before doing this?</i>

29:21.760 --> 29:23.400
Did you think about the warning?

29:24.160 --> 29:28.560
No. Did you think about
the ISI cash that you found?

29:28.640 --> 29:31.920
<i>About the people of Mumbai</i>
<i>whose lives could be in danger?</i>

29:32.720 --> 29:37.920
I was as concerned about all this
as you were about Nayanika.

29:39.360 --> 29:42.840
Why do men think that they're responsible
for every woman's life?

29:42.920 --> 29:47.160
<i>-When will you stop acting like saviors?</i>
-Someone has to act responsibly.

29:52.240 --> 29:55.520
You belong in the field,
and I belong at a desk.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.520
That's what you mean, right?

30:32.520 --> 30:35.080
After the murder of Bunty Sharma,

30:35.160 --> 30:38.480
a former member of Gaitonde's gang,
it is clear...

30:39.680 --> 30:42.200
that this was a case of old gang rivalry.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.720
Other members of Gaitonde's gang
have been killed in this manner,

30:47.800 --> 30:49.560
according to our intel.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.200
They will be identified soon.

30:54.240 --> 30:58.360
The Mumbai police
have solved this case in record time.

30:59.840 --> 31:02.920
I would like to congratulate
our competent officers.

31:09.520 --> 31:12.000
Why is Bhonsle so worried about this case?

31:12.800 --> 31:15.440
Sir, Gaitonde was his old friend.

31:17.800 --> 31:23.000
The list of Gaitonde's friends
is quite long.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.640
If we knew more about Trivedi,
we could get some information from him.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.200
The mood was ruined
before the party even began.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.400
We're keeping an eye on Trivedi's house.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.920
I don't think anyone will go there.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.960
-If we take a risk and...
-And?

31:44.800 --> 31:45.840
Sir...

31:46.400 --> 31:48.280
if we check Bhonsle's e-mail...

31:48.720 --> 31:50.160
Hack a minister's e-mail?

31:52.200 --> 31:53.960
It wouldn't be the first time, sir.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.360
<i>Horses from one side.</i>

32:00.440 --> 32:02.880
A helicopter from the other,
and maybe this side too.

32:02.960 --> 32:07.000
There are 20 or 25 cars approaching
with the villain and his goons.

32:07.080 --> 32:09.240
The cops on motorbikes from here.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.880
You're standing here with a sword,
blood gushing from your head.

32:12.960 --> 32:17.120
The girl is here.
As soon as the bad guy takes her away...

32:18.000 --> 32:21.160
you run towards them in slow motion
and boom! You know, Dad is getting us
Jackie Chan's action director.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.720
Is it because you're starring
in Ranbir's movie?

33:13.360 --> 33:16.920
But as far as I know... you're out of it.

33:20.520 --> 33:23.080
I told him that you'll act in our movie.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.160
Wasn't Jojo your pimp?

33:31.160 --> 33:32.640
And wasn't Gaitonde your client?

33:34.760 --> 33:35.840
I know everything.

33:37.360 --> 33:44.360
Be a nice girl... or the world
will soon know who you really are.

33:46.800 --> 33:50.160
Now, go outside and thank Dad.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.520
Thank him because you love the script.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.800
Then we'll do the movie together.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.560
I'll sort everything out. I'll sort everything out.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.560
I'll snort everything.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.560
-Sir...
-Andre.

34:46.639 --> 34:47.760
File a report.

34:48.639 --> 34:50.320
Otherwise she'll never leave.

34:51.080 --> 34:53.000
My name is Aasiya Bi.

34:53.440 --> 34:58.040
My son, Shamsul,
is missing from Bengali Bura.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.000
Come up for tea?

36:38.080 --> 36:40.360
SARTAJ SINGH POLICE INSPECTOR

36:44.320 --> 36:46.800
<i>There was a Parsi woman, Firoza.</i>

36:47.600 --> 36:51.560
<i>Her German Shepherd, Lucy, went missing.</i> <i>Your dad looked for her</i>
<i>for two days on foot.</i>

36:55.880 --> 36:57.640
<i>That lady had a nephew.</i>

36:57.720 --> 37:00.160
<i>He had stolen the dog to sell it off.</i>

37:00.240 --> 37:04.040
<i>Your dad slapped him hard</i>
<i>and returned the dog to her.</i>

37:04.160 --> 37:07.840
<i>The lady was so happy to see Lucy,</i>

37:07.920 --> 37:13.360
<i>that she kissed your dad on the cheek</i>
<i>and called him a real cop!</i>

37:14.000 --> 37:15.120
<i>Are you listening?</i>

37:15.240 --> 37:17.960
I am.
But why are you telling me this story?

37:18.880 --> 37:21.120
<i>I read the Granth Sahib,</i>
<i>but you're not religious,</i>

37:21.400 --> 37:24.720
<i>so I thought I'd tell you</i>
<i>a different kind of story.</i>

37:28.000 --> 37:30.240
Why do you think
I need to listen to a story?

37:30.760 --> 37:32.880
<i>Dear, I'm your mother.</i>

37:34.680 --> 37:38.680
TRUTH ALONE TRIUMPHS

37:56.400 --> 37:57.680
<i>Inspector Sartaj Singh.</i>

38:05.760 --> 38:08.800
Bunty Sharma was Gaitonde's
most loyal man.

38:09.480 --> 38:12.280
He was going to give us the details
of a missing shipment.

38:16.680 --> 38:17.800
<i>We got a tip, sir.</i>

38:19.760 --> 38:22.200
<i>We've noted it in the station entry log.</i>

38:22.600 --> 38:26.600
<i>There were two... Two terror suspects</i>
<i>hidden in Bengali Bura.</i>

38:28.960 --> 38:30.960
<i>Why is this shipment important?</i>

38:31.520 --> 38:35.120
Sir, Gaitonde warned us that something bad
was going to happen in 25 days.

38:35.960 --> 38:39.200
We had intel that the shipment
could be connected to this.

38:40.600 --> 38:44.200
Do you have any proof
other than Gaitonde's verbal warning?

38:50.960 --> 38:52.160
<i>DCP Parulkar,</i>

38:52.480 --> 38:56.960
<i>SPI Majid Khan and Constable Kamble</i>
<i>went to the first floor of the building.</i>

38:59.920 --> 39:03.360
<i>One team was blocking the alley,</i>
<i>and I was blocking the building's exit.</i>

39:06.640 --> 39:08.080
Sir!

39:08.160 --> 39:10.480
What was the boy's name?

39:13.360 --> 39:14.560
Sir, save me.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.040
Please save me!

39:18.600 --> 39:19.760
Junaid Sheikh, sir.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.400
Did he have a weapon?

39:23.920 --> 39:25.560
Save me, please!

39:29.000 --> 39:31.760
Did he have a weapon, Inspector Singh?

39:35.120 --> 39:36.240
Save me...

39:37.680 --> 39:38.600
Yes, sir.

39:39.880 --> 39:42.240
Junaid Sheikh fired at DCP Parulkar...

39:47.440 --> 39:49.040
and was killed in the return fire.

39:51.640 --> 39:54.760
Two of our decoys
and an escort were killed.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.440
Bunty Sharma and his companion
were the targets.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.600
In total, three of our people died.

40:01.040 --> 40:05.480
As per the intel,
this breach was from the Mumbai police.

40:11.560 --> 40:14.640
Sir, there were many rival gangs
after Bunty's life.

40:15.120 --> 40:16.560
It could have been anyone.
