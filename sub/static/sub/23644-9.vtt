WEBVTT

00:10.677 --> 00:13.045
There's a lot of, like,
chaos here.

00:14.048 --> 00:16.849
The activity is just
destroying my family.

00:17.985 --> 00:22.287
Someone came here
to hurt the people here.

00:22.289 --> 00:23.622
I feel like it's demonic.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.027
They're a result of dark magic.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.564
It could be some kind of
witchcraft or curses.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.500
It is so, so bad.

00:35.502 --> 00:37.636
I can't even imagine now

00:37.638 --> 00:40.038
the torture
he's going through.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.274
It's not safe,
it's not safe, it's not safe.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.345
Panic, panic, panic.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.480
My name is Amy Allan.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.249
I'm seeing, like, blood.

00:50.251 --> 00:53.351
The house just feels bad.

00:53.353 --> 00:54.920
I see dead people.

00:54.922 --> 00:59.391
This man is completely insane.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.360
I speak to dead people.

01:02.362 --> 01:04.596
Okay, she doesn't
like it in there.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.498
And they speak to me.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.633
He likes to twist that knife.

01:08.635 --> 01:12.103
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:12.105 --> 01:15.707
Something paranormal
is trying to kill them.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.275
I rely on my partner.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.044
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:19.046 --> 01:21.146
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.714
Now, does he die right
there on the spot?

01:22.716 --> 01:26.685
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.254
I think it's trying
to steal my soul.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.123
It's my job to reveal them.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.325
You ever get touched
like that again?

01:33.327 --> 01:35.093
But Steve and I never speak...

01:35.095 --> 01:37.228
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.696
...until the very end...

01:38.698 --> 01:40.598
I'm as stunned
as you guys are.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.634
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:42.636 --> 01:44.836
I don't want anything to
happen to my daughter.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.705
...or time to get out.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.107
His goal is to kill you guys.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074

02:05.926 --> 02:07.859
I'm out here in
Pinellas Park, Florida.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.860
It's about 20 miles
west of Tampa.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.596
I got a call from woman
named Minou.

02:11.598 --> 02:14.166
Now, she sounded terrible
on the phone.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.601
Says ever since her adult son

02:15.603 --> 02:17.469
moved back into
the family house,

02:17.471 --> 02:20.071
activity has been violent
and out of control.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.873
She says if Amy and I
can't stop it,

02:21.875 --> 02:24.008
she thinks someone's
gonna get killed.

02:30.350 --> 02:31.749
Before Amy arrives,

02:31.751 --> 02:34.953
I clear the house of
any leading information.

02:34.955 --> 02:39.024
Photographs, dream catchers,

02:39.026 --> 02:43.528
and other personal items
can influence her findings,

02:43.530 --> 02:47.031
so it's important that
I cover or remove them all.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.233
When I'm done,

02:48.235 --> 02:50.569
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.084
This is bad.

03:06.086 --> 03:07.553
The first thing I get
is anxiety --

03:07.555 --> 03:11.923
massive anxiety and digestive
disorders in the living,

03:11.925 --> 03:13.926
and then I heard jealousy.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.530
It's not safe,
it's not safe, it's not safe.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.931
They've got to go,
they've got to go,

03:19.933 --> 03:21.199
they've got to go.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.277
So, Minou, when
we spoke on the phone,

03:32.279 --> 03:33.912
you didn't sound
really great.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.080
Sounds like you're
going through hell here.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.348
What's going on?

03:36.350 --> 03:38.417
Well, the activity
is just out of control

03:38.419 --> 03:42.287
and, I mean, just complete
and utter hell.

03:42.289 --> 03:45.757
Aw.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.326
I know. I'm sorry, honey.
I know.

03:48.328 --> 03:51.362
I can only imagine.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.599
So, what kind of things
are you guys experiencing?

03:53.601 --> 03:56.267
We're feeling
we're being watched,

03:56.269 --> 03:58.837
hearing voices,

03:58.839 --> 04:02.707
shadow figures,
nightmares,

04:02.709 --> 04:05.043
mental and physical
health declining,

04:05.045 --> 04:06.311
and physical attacks.

04:06.313 --> 04:07.913
How long
have you been here?

04:07.915 --> 04:11.183
Well, my parents
built this house in 1977

04:11.185 --> 04:14.586
and I've lived here
on and off since then.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.053
Do you know any history
about the house

04:16.055 --> 04:17.255
that might help me?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.991
There's a family friend
that died here.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.293
And the family friend
passed away in the house?

04:22.295 --> 04:25.330
Yes, he passed away
back in the bedroom

04:25.332 --> 04:27.666
where most of
the activity is at.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.334
Whose room is that now?

04:29.336 --> 04:31.136
My son, Jon Paul.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.071
Who else lives
in the house with you?

04:35.242 --> 04:36.575
That's my sister,
Shannon.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.809
All right.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.211
And that's
my son's father, Rick.
Okay.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.414
That's me,
that's my brother,

04:42.416 --> 04:44.683
and that's my son,
Jon Paul.
Okay.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.985
Since my son
moved back in,

04:46.987 --> 04:50.088
things have just been
getting gradually worse.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.956
So you think your son
moving back in

04:51.958 --> 04:53.591
caused all these
problems here?

04:53.593 --> 04:58.096
No. I think it's the girl
that he brought over here.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.499
She dabbled in the occult.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.701
It just feels like

05:02.703 --> 05:06.104
maybe she put
some kind of curse on him.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.440
Okay.
Is he having experiences?

05:08.442 --> 05:10.875
He's not been eating.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.444
He's quit his job,

05:12.446 --> 05:14.378
He almost quit school.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.948
He's losing weight,
and I just feel like

05:16.950 --> 05:21.353
his physical and mental health
are just diving down.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.721
And you think
this has all to do

05:22.723 --> 05:24.256
with the paranormal activity
that's going on here?

05:24.258 --> 05:26.725
Yes, I do.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.260
You okay?

05:28.262 --> 05:30.729
I know.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.764
It's just hard to see him
go through it.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.266
Yeah, I know.

05:34.268 --> 05:35.366
It's your baby.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.469
- It's killing me.
- I know.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.805
I feel like I'm crazy.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.307
You're not crazy, honey.

05:42.309 --> 05:45.777
I'm so depressed,
and it's causing
a lot of anxiety.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.012
With all the stuff
that's going on here,

05:47.014 --> 05:48.213
why don't you just move?

05:48.215 --> 05:50.749
To be honest, Steve,
I feel like running away.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.884
But it's my family home.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.619
I'm not gonna
let them win.

05:54.621 --> 05:58.389
This is <i> my</i> house.
This is where <i> I</i> live.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.429
Someone is sick here.

06:04.431 --> 06:06.898
Very, very sick.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.900
I'm seeing this dead woman.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.770
She has long, dark hair.

06:13.173 --> 06:16.207
I feel despair and depression
with her.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.977
The living absolutely feel
this depression.

06:23.117 --> 06:26.784
It kind of gets worse
in here.

06:26.786 --> 06:30.055
The living would be
susceptible to her energy,

06:30.057 --> 06:34.860
and I feel like she is
wrapped around this person --

06:34.862 --> 06:36.661
a male here.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.598
Yeah, she's, like,
wrapped around them.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.399
I think
there's a connection with

06:41.401 --> 06:44.269
whoever that male is
that she's with,

06:44.271 --> 06:46.971
which is <i> really</i> wrapped.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.447
All right, Minou,
so what's going on in here?

06:55.449 --> 06:57.549
In this room,
there's a chair,

06:57.551 --> 06:59.751
and it moved on its own.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.319
Okay, so what happened?

07:01.321 --> 07:02.821
It just kind of
went back,

07:02.823 --> 07:05.890
hit the door,
and spun around.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.893
And you didn't see anything
that could have done that?
No.

07:08.895 --> 07:11.496
Well, if it can make
a chair move like that,

07:11.498 --> 07:12.697
that's pretty dangerous.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.166
- Yeah.
- All right, anything else?

07:14.168 --> 07:15.533
Shadow figures.

07:15.535 --> 07:19.137
I see them all the time
walking in the living room

07:19.139 --> 07:20.372
and outside,

07:20.374 --> 07:22.807
and I think it's somebody
at the front door,

07:22.809 --> 07:25.109
and I get up and open the door,
and nobody's there.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.711
Okay, so describe
the ones you see

07:26.713 --> 07:27.912
on the inside of the house.

07:27.914 --> 07:30.348
Like a gray shadow.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.416
Is it something
you can see through,

07:31.418 --> 07:32.851
or is it something
that's kind of misty?

07:32.853 --> 07:35.120
You can see through it,
like a shadow on a wall,

07:35.122 --> 07:36.454
like somebody walking.
Okay.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.857
And the ones you see outside,
is it similar?

07:38.859 --> 07:39.991
It's darker.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.392
You see more than one?

07:41.394 --> 07:42.460
Sometimes it's one,

07:42.462 --> 07:44.929
sometimes
it's one, two, three.

07:44.931 --> 07:46.264
Is anybody else
seeing this stuff,

07:46.266 --> 07:47.899
or are you hallucinating,
maybe?

07:47.901 --> 07:50.335
No, my sister
sees them, too.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.702
Okay, anything else?

07:51.704 --> 07:53.204
As soon as you walk
into the house,

07:53.206 --> 07:56.007
the whole entire house
is just this dark,

07:56.009 --> 07:58.777
heavy, weighted feeling
on your shoulders.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.278
It's a negative
kind of thing.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.413
So being exposed to
this heavy feeling --

08:02.415 --> 08:03.815
how does it affect you?

08:03.817 --> 08:06.017
I get really fatigued

08:06.019 --> 08:08.653
and very nauseated
sometimes.

08:11.391 --> 08:14.492
There's a blond chick
who's with me now,

08:14.494 --> 08:16.928
and she's dead.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.630
Just anger and hate
all over her face,

08:19.632 --> 08:21.900
and she just screamed at me,
"Get out!"

08:23.737 --> 08:25.370
I just think
the negative energy here

08:25.372 --> 08:27.539
does make people sick.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.507
Oohee, oohee, oohee,
oohee, oohee.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.109
I'm getting a head pain.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.919
Okay, so, Minou, what's
the story with this room?

08:40.921 --> 08:42.720
Well, this is the room
that I grew up in,

08:42.722 --> 08:45.089
and this is where
my son sleeps now.

08:45.091 --> 08:46.724
Okay, so what's going on?

08:46.726 --> 08:48.726
I have a lot
of physical pain.

08:48.728 --> 08:51.563
I get terrible migraines.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.798
Now, do you have any kind
of medical condition

08:53.800 --> 08:55.266
that might cause
that kind of pain?

08:55.268 --> 08:56.734
I have fibromyalgia,

08:56.736 --> 08:59.804
but when I'm here,
it just seems so bad

08:59.806 --> 09:03.040
and when I leave,
it seems to be better.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.442
Okay.
Anything else?

09:04.444 --> 09:06.645
Yeah, I have nightmares
all the time.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.746
Okay. What kind of nightmares
are we talking about?

09:08.748 --> 09:11.249
I had a dream where
I was being choked,

09:11.251 --> 09:14.185
and I woke up and
I couldn't barely breathe.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.586
It was terrible.

09:15.588 --> 09:18.923
I've never in my life
experienced something like that.

09:18.925 --> 09:20.024
Who was choking you?

09:20.026 --> 09:21.359
I don't know.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.094
Aw, come here.
Come on.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.295
I know
you're stressing out.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.164
Relax. Okay?

09:26.166 --> 09:28.366
Relax.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.904
How's all this activity
affecting your relationship

09:33.906 --> 09:35.406
with your son?

09:35.408 --> 09:37.575
We've always had
a really good relationship,

09:37.577 --> 09:41.012
and lately,
just hasn't been there.
All right.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.781
These things
are happening to him,

09:42.783 --> 09:44.315
and they're for real.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.352
He's being attacked
through all of this.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.720
Okay.

09:48.722 --> 09:52.023
These things are
destroying my family.

09:54.861 --> 09:57.596
There are attacks
coming from here.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.831
I feel like it is
possibly the blonde.

10:00.833 --> 10:07.138
She is jealous because
she wants to be alive again,

10:07.140 --> 10:10.274
but she mainly does it
because she hates everybody

10:10.276 --> 10:14.345
and she's pissed off
and she's miserable.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.815
So I just see her
smothering a person,

10:17.817 --> 10:19.484
trying to kill them.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.473
So, Shannon, I understand
you're Minou's sister

10:42.475 --> 10:44.509
and that you live here,
actually.

10:44.511 --> 10:45.677
Yes.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.812
She called us in
because of her concern

10:47.814 --> 10:49.013
for her son, Jon.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.615
Do you have concerns
for him, as well?

10:50.617 --> 10:51.750
Very much so.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.085
The way he acts
is completely different.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.052
Okay.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.354
Now, your sister
mentioned to me

10:56.356 --> 10:57.422
that within the last year,

10:57.424 --> 10:59.690
the activities
really got crazy.

10:59.692 --> 11:00.992
Does that make sense
to you?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.159
Yes, that's correct.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.095
Okay.
As far as experiences go,

11:04.097 --> 11:06.164
I'm pretty confident you
probably have had some, right?

11:06.166 --> 11:07.765
- Many, many experiences.
- Okay.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.167
Let's talk about
some of them.

11:09.169 --> 11:13.104
Okay, well, I've seen, like,
different shadow figures

11:13.106 --> 11:16.707
throughout the house,
outside and inside.

11:16.709 --> 11:20.512
Your sister mentioned to me
about shadow figures, as well.

11:20.514 --> 11:23.014
So when you see these
shadow figures, how
many are you seeing?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.849
Sometimes
three, four in a row,

11:24.851 --> 11:27.852
just walking past the TV
down the hallway.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.688
Okay. Do they feel
threatening to you?

11:30.690 --> 11:31.956
Yes.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.492
I feel like it's demonic.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.594
So, anything else?

11:36.596 --> 11:40.298
I've been touched in some
really inappropriate ways.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.201
Okay, honey.
You okay?

11:43.203 --> 11:45.637
Yeah.

11:45.639 --> 11:46.971
Hopefully we'll get
to the bottom of this

11:46.973 --> 11:48.539
and get this fixed.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.841
Anything else going on?

11:50.843 --> 11:53.377
There's just a lot of
negative energy in the house.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.414
Feel so drained,
really bad anxiety.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.715
And when you leave here,
do you feel any better?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.417
If I'm gone for
a couple days, yeah,

11:59.419 --> 12:01.219
I start to feel
a little better.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.221
But when we come back in,
it's just like, ""

12:04.223 --> 12:05.356
It's really difficult.

12:05.358 --> 12:09.961
It's like every day
is just one more day

12:09.963 --> 12:12.163
that you're living
in hell.

12:14.701 --> 12:20.104
Spending time in here
is not really good.

12:20.106 --> 12:25.977
It feels like
overwhelming despair,

12:25.979 --> 12:28.780
hopelessness,

12:28.782 --> 12:31.883
depression, anxiety,

12:31.885 --> 12:35.319
and then I feel sick,
like I'm gonna vomit.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.555
Oooh, it's bad.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.990
My head hurts a lot.

12:42.528 --> 12:44.829
There are some weird
shadow things out here.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.969
They kind of look like rats.

12:50.971 --> 12:54.672
And they were, like, laughing

12:54.674 --> 12:58.242
and trying to make us go away,

12:58.244 --> 13:02.713
and I feel like that they were
put here by someone.

13:02.715 --> 13:05.883
I know that they're destructive
to the living,

13:05.885 --> 13:09.120
'cause these things
are not good at all.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.360
So, Jon,
your mom called us in

13:16.362 --> 13:17.896
'cause she's pretty concerned
that something here

13:17.898 --> 13:18.830
is going after you.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.365
Now, do you agree
with that?

13:20.367 --> 13:22.567
Yeah, I kind of keep it
to myself.

13:22.569 --> 13:25.436
It's easier to, like,
convince myself

13:25.438 --> 13:28.839
that it's not real,
or that it's just in my head.
Okay.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.975
Mom said to me that
the activity here

13:30.977 --> 13:34.044
really got crazy
once you moved back in.-

13:34.046 --> 13:36.447
She mentioned
that she thought

13:36.449 --> 13:38.182
the girl you were seeing
that was into the occult

13:38.184 --> 13:40.117
might have put
a curse on you guys.

13:40.119 --> 13:41.518
Did you ever
think about that?

13:41.520 --> 13:43.321
Yeah, I mean, it's something
I've considered.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.191
It could be, you know,

13:46.193 --> 13:50.160
some kind of witchcraft
or curses or something.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.063
Have you experienced paranormal
before you moved here?

13:53.065 --> 13:54.265
Yeah.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.933
So, let's talk about
your experiences.

13:55.935 --> 13:57.534
What are you
going through?

13:57.536 --> 14:01.339
Anxiety,
you know, nightmares,

14:01.341 --> 14:02.539
sleeplessness.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.008
What kind of nightmares
are we talking about?

14:04.010 --> 14:06.710
I'll be, like, asleep,
and I had my arm out,

14:06.712 --> 14:08.679
and it was strange --

14:08.681 --> 14:11.349
like someone, like,
tried to

14:11.351 --> 14:14.619
almost kind of pull me
out of my body, I guess.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.088
It's something
I deal with all the time.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.223
Okay, all right.
So anything else?

14:19.225 --> 14:20.525
Just voices.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.960
How often
are you hearing this?

14:21.962 --> 14:25.296
All the time, unless
I actively block it out.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.764
What do you think
these voices are?

14:26.766 --> 14:30.034
I'm not sure,
but I think they're demonic.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.702
All right,
so anything else?

14:31.704 --> 14:34.405
I see things,
like a mist.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.940
It's almost like
an energy.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.175
It's hard to explain.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.810
You get any kind of
a vibe from it?

14:38.812 --> 14:41.846
Yeah, but it's never
anything positive.

14:41.848 --> 14:44.382
Any thought as to what
you think this thing

14:44.384 --> 14:45.650
wants from you?

14:45.652 --> 14:48.186
I feel it's already
trying to hurt people

14:48.188 --> 14:50.054
in my family.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.927
I'm getting
a living male saying,

14:56.929 --> 14:58.329
"I don't want to be
involved with this.

14:58.331 --> 15:01.799
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?"

15:01.801 --> 15:04.535
This person seems very angry,

15:04.537 --> 15:06.837
confused, upset.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.673
Feels like an angry teenager.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.541
But it might be older,

15:10.543 --> 15:13.878
so I'd say, like,
maybe 20s to 30s.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.882
There's a lot of, like,
chaos here, mentally.

15:20.219 --> 15:23.888
I think it has to do with
those shadow-rat creatures.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.357
Those little rats
throughout here --

15:26.359 --> 15:27.958
I'd say 20.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.893
Do you have any idea
what these things are?

15:29.895 --> 15:33.964
They're a result of
bad or dark magic,

15:33.966 --> 15:36.534
kind of like a curse
of some kind.

15:38.104 --> 15:42.639
Someone came here
to hurt the people here.

15:42.641 --> 15:44.042
You know if the living
would see these things

15:44.044 --> 15:45.642
or have any other
experiences with them?

15:45.644 --> 15:47.378
I think that
they would see them.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.780
They're very physical.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.382
They would hear them laughing.

15:51.384 --> 15:55.553
They would experience
far more anger,

15:55.555 --> 15:58.522
depression, fatigue.

15:58.524 --> 16:01.059
They would have
random illnesses.

16:01.061 --> 16:05.596
Nothing good
can stay in this house.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.665
No good energy,
not happiness --

16:07.667 --> 16:11.502
nothing like that
can survive in this place.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.218
Minou says a friend of
the family died in the house

16:28.220 --> 16:29.387
back in the '90s,

16:29.389 --> 16:31.389
so I made some calls,
and she's right.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.590
Turns out the guy was really

16:32.592 --> 16:34.926
a good friend of
Minou's brother, Jack.

16:34.928 --> 16:36.060
So I'm headed back to the house

16:36.062 --> 16:37.628
to find out exactly
what happened.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.402
Well, Jack, thanks for
sitting down with me.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.636
I appreciate that.

16:45.638 --> 16:46.904
Now, I understand
you were pretty close

16:46.906 --> 16:48.606
with the guy
that died in the house.

16:48.608 --> 16:49.707
What can you tell me
about him?

16:49.709 --> 16:51.241
His name was
Lloyd Ferris.

16:51.243 --> 16:54.178
He moved from
upstate New York

16:54.180 --> 16:56.380
to Florida, here,
in this area,

16:56.382 --> 16:57.882
in the mid-'80s.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.718
He met my mother
at an AA meeting,

17:00.720 --> 17:04.588
and they kind of
hit it off as friends,

17:04.589 --> 17:06.123
and he needed
a place to stay

17:06.125 --> 17:08.726
and she had an open room,
so he moved in.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.962
It all became like
he was family.

17:10.964 --> 17:12.296
What kind of a man
was he?

17:12.298 --> 17:13.731
He was kind of quiet.

17:13.733 --> 17:17.702
He was fairly tall,
shortish gray hair.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.637
Do you have
any photos of him?

17:19.638 --> 17:23.974
No, he really never wanted
his picture taken.

17:23.977 --> 17:25.041
What else
do you know about him?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.176
He was married
and had four children.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.780
At some point,
he became estranged

17:29.782 --> 17:32.016
from his ex
and his children.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.518
They didn't talk.
- Okay.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.587
You think that had something
to do with the drinking?

17:36.589 --> 17:39.323
I think it's
a real good possibility.

17:39.325 --> 17:40.625
It really hurt him bad

17:40.627 --> 17:43.261
that he didn't really
get to see his children.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.296
Can you take me through
the day he died?

17:45.298 --> 17:48.199
It was March 31st, 1995.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.201
Okay.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.804
He had gone in
to take a shower

17:53.806 --> 17:56.006
and went into the bedroom

17:56.008 --> 18:00.744
and laid down in the bed
and passed away.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.814
We're fairly certain that
it was a heart attack.

18:02.816 --> 18:04.148
How old was he?

18:04.150 --> 18:05.550
67.

18:05.552 --> 18:08.085
I'm curious --
do you think Lloyd is here,

18:08.087 --> 18:09.420
in the house?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.655
I definitely
believe he's here.

18:11.657 --> 18:14.958
I think he helps
try to protect the family

18:14.960 --> 18:17.428
and the house
from whatever's going on.
Okay.

18:17.430 --> 18:21.231
But he's not strong enough
to stop whatever it is.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.703
Somebody dropped dead
from a heart attack here.

18:26.705 --> 18:28.372
It was an older male.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.745
Do you have any idea
how long ago this was?

18:34.747 --> 18:36.280
This is fairly recent.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.182
I wouldn't go
earlier than the '90s,

18:39.184 --> 18:40.318
I don't think.

18:45.691 --> 18:50.394
He has lots of worry
about children.

18:50.396 --> 18:55.232
I think he's trying to talk
mostly to a male.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.400
This male -- living male --

18:56.402 --> 18:59.336
does not want to
even deal with any of this.

18:59.338 --> 19:03.341
I feel like the males
are related.

19:03.343 --> 19:08.245
He says that he keeps
trying to tell them to move,

19:08.247 --> 19:09.680
to get out of the house.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.549
It's not safe.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.752
I don't know what
Amy's gonna find on her walk,

19:14.754 --> 19:16.687
but to me,
some of the experiences

19:16.689 --> 19:19.023
the family's having
could be easily explained,

19:19.025 --> 19:20.491
so I've called in
a home inspector

19:20.493 --> 19:22.560
to see if any of this
could be environmental.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.800
The reason
I called you in

19:29.802 --> 19:33.504
is my clients here are having
some strange experiences

19:33.506 --> 19:35.472
and mood issues
and stuff like that.

19:35.474 --> 19:36.907
Some of the stuff
they're talking about

19:36.909 --> 19:38.876
they're going through
sounds like hallucinations.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.044
I've been doing this
a long time,

19:40.046 --> 19:41.845
and I can't blame everything
on the paranormal.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.781
Sometimes it could be
environmental --

19:43.783 --> 19:46.117
you know, like maybe
carbon monoxide or mold.

19:46.119 --> 19:48.218
So can you do some
testing to see

19:48.220 --> 19:49.186
if maybe
that's the issue?

19:49.188 --> 19:51.389
I can do some air sampling.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.324
I'll do one on the inside
and one on the outside,

19:53.326 --> 19:54.525
compare the two.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.659
Thanks, buddy.
I appreciate that.

19:55.661 --> 19:56.727
Let me know
what you find out.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.062
I'll get started on it.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.399
When you work a homicide,

20:02.401 --> 20:04.001
you have to rule out
the obvious first,

20:04.003 --> 20:07.538
and that's exactly
what I'm doing here.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.407
If there's
an environmental issue,

20:09.409 --> 20:11.175
it might explain why
everyone in the house

20:11.177 --> 20:14.278
is seeing and hearing
so many of the same things.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.151
All right, Brad,
so how'd it go?

20:21.153 --> 20:23.821
I did find a roof leak
in the back --

20:23.823 --> 20:25.756
little bit of mold on it.
Okay.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.825
I did find a spot of mold
under the air handler

20:28.827 --> 20:30.895
in the hallway.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.296
But other than that,

20:32.298 --> 20:34.765
I don't see any major problems
with this home.

20:34.767 --> 20:35.966
All right,
so it doesn't sound like

20:35.968 --> 20:37.435
there's enough mold there
that would cause

20:37.437 --> 20:39.637
any kind of hallucinations
or any kind of mood changes

20:39.639 --> 20:40.838
or anything like that.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.706
I wouldn't think so, no.

20:42.708 --> 20:46.077
All right, so now I know
it's not environmental.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.312
It's got to be
something else.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.182
Those shadow-rat things

20:52.184 --> 20:55.385
are trapping
the negative energy inside.

20:55.387 --> 20:56.854
They're putting up blocks.
Paranormal.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.056
No,
that negativity ain't leaving.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.658
They'll let the negative in.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.793
They won't let
the negative energy out, though.

21:02.795 --> 21:06.297
Now it just spins and becomes
more and more dark.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.368
And they are preventing
any energy

21:11.370 --> 21:14.805
from like, you know,
spreading around

21:14.807 --> 21:16.073
or cleansing or anything.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.208
That's why it's circled back

21:17.210 --> 21:18.743
and it's just circling
around this house

21:18.745 --> 21:20.811
and turning black
and black and black.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.820
For more information
about the show,

21:29.822 --> 21:31.355
and if you need us to
investigate

21:31.357 --> 21:33.357
unexplained activity
in your home...

21:38.698 --> 21:39.697
and we'll help if we can.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.674
Here's what I got so far --

21:50.676 --> 21:53.143
a client who believes a curse
has been placed on her home

21:53.145 --> 21:55.212
and a family friend who
dropped dead of a heart attack

21:55.214 --> 21:56.814
in one of the bedrooms.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.783
But I'm thinking there's
got to be something else.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.488
Searching through old records,

22:04.490 --> 22:06.156
I come across Milton Bryan,

22:06.158 --> 22:08.092
who used to own
Minou's property.

22:10.396 --> 22:13.831
Turns out,
Milton's wife killed herself.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.337
You know, I got to know more
about this suicide,

22:20.339 --> 22:22.005
so I've reached out
to a local professor

22:22.007 --> 22:23.874
who's looking into this for me,

22:23.876 --> 22:25.542
and she says she's got
some information

22:25.544 --> 22:27.411
that will definitely
help my case.

22:35.254 --> 22:36.187
So now, Dr. Stark,

22:36.189 --> 22:37.921
I know
one of the original owners

22:37.923 --> 22:40.191
of my client's property's
wife committed suicide,

22:40.193 --> 22:41.725
but before we even
get to that part,

22:41.727 --> 22:43.060
what do we know about him?

22:43.062 --> 22:45.796
Milton Bryan is kind of
a really interesting fellow.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.631
He started off as
a blue-collar worker.

22:47.633 --> 22:48.799
He was a butcher,

22:48.801 --> 22:50.768
and he decided to go into
the dairy business.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.035
He was very,
very successful.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.271
He had, at the peak,
400 head of cattle,

22:54.273 --> 22:56.473
1,100 acres,
which was quite good.

22:56.475 --> 22:58.442
And that encompassed
my client's property?

22:58.444 --> 22:59.610
That is correct.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.012
So, obviously he was married.
When did he get married?

23:02.014 --> 23:03.881
- Well, he has two wives.
- Okay.

23:03.883 --> 23:07.684
The first wife is Blanche.
He's 22, she's 21.

23:07.686 --> 23:08.953
They seemed to
kind of get along,

23:08.955 --> 23:11.221
except that there's
no children for four years.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.123
Do we think it had
something to do with maybe

23:13.125 --> 23:15.092
issues with the marriage
or anything like that?

23:15.094 --> 23:16.359
Absolutely, yeah.

23:16.361 --> 23:18.562
Blanche had these
odd bouts of illness,

23:18.564 --> 23:20.631
so she'd go to
her family's farm

23:20.633 --> 23:22.299
to rest and recover.

23:22.301 --> 23:24.101
Now, do we know anything
about these illnesses?

23:24.103 --> 23:25.302
There is some speculation

23:25.304 --> 23:26.337
that it might have
been depression,

23:26.339 --> 23:28.772
or perhaps
postpartum issues.

23:28.774 --> 23:30.407
Now, we know
she commits suicide.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.575
What happened?

23:31.577 --> 23:34.578
She has a second child
named Mavis

23:34.580 --> 23:36.780
in January of 1924.

23:36.782 --> 23:38.415
This child
does not do well.

23:38.417 --> 23:42.119
By April 8th of 1924,
Mavis died.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.721
Later the same day,
she actually got

23:43.723 --> 23:46.791
a.32 caliber pistol,
climbed into bed,

23:46.793 --> 23:49.459
put the pistol to her forehead,
and pulled the trigger

23:49.461 --> 23:51.194
and died instantly.

23:51.196 --> 23:53.230
- Wow.
- There's the article.

23:53.232 --> 23:55.999
She was 33 years old,
and her body was discovered

23:56.001 --> 23:58.001
by her 7-year-old
daughter, Lorraine.

23:58.003 --> 23:59.903
I've been there
where I've had to deal with

23:59.905 --> 24:02.606
young children
that found a parent

24:02.608 --> 24:03.807
that committed suicide,

24:03.809 --> 24:06.610
and they don't
bounce back from that.
No.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.846
So now
we've got Milton here,

24:08.848 --> 24:11.549
who lost a kid,
lost his wife.-

24:11.551 --> 24:13.083
What does he do
after that?

24:13.085 --> 24:16.319
Within seven months,
he remarries.

24:16.321 --> 24:19.723
He marries a woman
by the name of Pansy --

24:19.725 --> 24:21.492
Pansy Tenor.

24:21.494 --> 24:22.826
This guy didn't
waste no time.

24:22.828 --> 24:24.295
She was 18 years old,

24:24.297 --> 24:26.696
and he was 34
when they married.

24:26.698 --> 24:28.766
Okay, so Milton's remarried
at this point.

24:28.768 --> 24:29.900
What happens next?

24:29.902 --> 24:31.234
They actually have
two sons,

24:31.236 --> 24:33.437
and it seems to be
a really decent marriage.

24:33.439 --> 24:35.172
They stayed together.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.942
He dies in 1947
of a massive heart attack

24:37.944 --> 24:39.710
at 57 years of age.

24:39.712 --> 24:40.911
Wow.

24:40.913 --> 24:44.047
Now, I do have
his death certificate.

24:44.049 --> 24:45.683
And he dies on
my client's property?

24:45.685 --> 24:47.317
That's correct, yes.

24:51.590 --> 24:55.159
The blond lady's here,
ranting and raving.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.995
She had been brought here
by a living person

24:58.997 --> 25:00.530
who couldn't get over her death

25:00.532 --> 25:02.198
and now she's stuck here.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.034
Do you have any idea
on who it was

25:04.036 --> 25:05.402
that did that to her?

25:05.404 --> 25:08.272
I think it was
an older man who did this.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.341
It seemed like
she got married young,

25:10.343 --> 25:12.475
and I think she was
kind of forced into that,

25:12.477 --> 25:18.449
and then there was a death
very soon afterwards.

25:18.451 --> 25:21.685
I think she had a child,
and she didn't want children.

25:21.687 --> 25:24.889
The way she treated
that child was not good.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.423
I do see a gun.

25:26.425 --> 25:29.860
I don't know
if she killed herself.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.828
So she got, like, a raw deal.

25:31.830 --> 25:33.964
She's <i> beyond</i> angry.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.632
She goes on a rampage,

25:35.634 --> 25:38.168
and then everybody
has to pay for the
situation she's in.

25:38.170 --> 25:41.171
She says, "It was a short life,
and it sucked.

25:41.173 --> 25:44.641
Now I'm dead,
and I'm trapped here."

25:52.251 --> 25:55.852
I saw several horrifying things
during my walk,

25:55.854 --> 25:58.388
but two stood out --

25:58.390 --> 26:01.358
first, the dead woman attacking
a living person.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.560
The dead lady
had blond hair,

26:03.562 --> 26:05.529
very well done.

26:05.531 --> 26:08.531
and she was
in the process of trying

26:08.533 --> 26:12.269
to smother this kid
in the bed

26:12.271 --> 26:15.939
by covering her mouth
and pinching her nose.

26:18.610 --> 26:21.011
Next, I described
the rat creatures

26:21.013 --> 26:23.747
trapping bad energy
inside the house.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.216
They were all on
their hind legs.

26:26.218 --> 26:29.152
I would say they were
about, like, this tall.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.929
Amy, is this what you saw?

26:40.166 --> 26:42.299
Yes, that's what I saw.

27:02.688 --> 27:05.722
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:05.724 --> 27:07.657
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:07.659 --> 27:11.428
and our clients
for the first time.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.130
Well, Amy, this is Minou.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.597
Her story broke my heart.

27:14.599 --> 27:17.034
She's hurting,
and I hope and pray

27:17.036 --> 27:19.302
at the end of this,
we can bring her some hope.

27:19.304 --> 27:22.106
This is her sister, Shannon,
who lives here

27:22.108 --> 27:26.510
along with their brother,
Jack,

27:26.512 --> 27:28.512
Minou's ex, Rick.

27:28.514 --> 27:31.047
This is her son, Jon.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.249
Now, nobody feels safe,

27:33.251 --> 27:35.652
and they all feel that
if we can't help them,

27:35.654 --> 27:38.455
somebody's gonna
get seriously hurt.

27:38.457 --> 27:40.490
So now that Amy knows
who you guys are,

27:40.492 --> 27:42.793
I'll ask her to describe
her walk for us.

27:45.631 --> 27:49.332
The first thing that I got
was in the hallway.

27:49.334 --> 27:53.704
This was energy off of
a living person that's here,

27:53.706 --> 27:56.073
and I heard, "I don't want to
be involved in this.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.874
Why are you doing this?"

27:57.876 --> 28:02.011
And there seemed to be
a lot of mental chaos.

28:02.013 --> 28:06.282
I felt like the individual
was really, really immature.

28:06.284 --> 28:08.885
The emotion and
the mental state seemed like,

28:08.887 --> 28:12.622
you know, when teenagers
are going nuts,

28:12.624 --> 28:15.025
but I kept thinking
that this person

28:15.027 --> 28:18.695
is older than that --
maybe in their 20s or 30s.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.563
One of the main reasons
Minou called us in

28:20.565 --> 28:21.965
was because of
her son, Jon,

28:21.967 --> 28:23.634
and she's really
worried about him.

28:23.636 --> 28:26.303
Tell Amy how he's changed.

28:26.305 --> 28:29.673
He doesn't hardly eat,
he doesn't hardly sleep,

28:29.675 --> 28:32.576
and he is very immature.

28:32.578 --> 28:34.644
- How old is he?
- He's 30.

28:39.284 --> 28:41.718
He seems like
a tortured soul to me.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.588
He is.
It's terrible.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.523
Where does he sleep?

28:46.525 --> 28:48.792
He sleeps in the back bedroom
to the right.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.059
Really?

28:50.061 --> 28:55.065
I did get that there was
a deceased female

28:55.067 --> 28:58.869
who has latched on to
a male in that bedroom.

28:58.871 --> 29:03.573
Long brown hair,
pale skin, very thin.

29:03.575 --> 29:08.077
Is it possible
that she would

29:08.079 --> 29:09.913
want him to herself?

29:09.915 --> 29:11.948
Yeah, she's on him --

29:11.950 --> 29:15.385
like, literally
wrapped around him.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.826
You need a break, honey?

29:22.828 --> 29:25.229
I'll be okay.

29:28.634 --> 29:31.000
All right, so what else?

29:31.002 --> 29:34.538
This other person
that I encountered
is another woman.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.240
This one is a blonde.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.141
Very, very unhappy
dead person.

29:38.143 --> 29:40.377
She feels like she never
got a chance to live

29:40.379 --> 29:43.046
the life <i> she</i> wanted to live.

29:43.048 --> 29:44.581
She wanted a career,

29:44.583 --> 29:46.516
but instead,
she married very young.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.452
Did not want to
be a housewife.

29:48.454 --> 29:51.555
So I don't think that
she wanted to be a mother.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.390
She said she died young,

29:53.392 --> 29:56.026
which makes her
even more upset.

29:56.028 --> 30:00.063
She might have been
around 27 when she died.

30:00.065 --> 30:03.600
She died unusually,
but I'm not exactly sure how.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.035
I know
she didn't die here.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.636
She kept saying,
"I don't belong here"

30:06.638 --> 30:08.138
over and over.

30:08.140 --> 30:11.942
After she died,
family member brought her here

30:11.944 --> 30:15.112
because that person just
couldn't get over her death.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.281
Then when that person died,

30:17.283 --> 30:19.616
they moved on,
but she didn't.

30:19.618 --> 30:23.620
She got stuck here,
and she's pissed.

30:23.622 --> 30:24.888
It kind of sounds like
somebody

30:24.890 --> 30:26.857
I came across
in my research.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.291
Her name was Blanche Bryan,

30:28.293 --> 30:31.161
and her life
<i>was</i> short and tragic.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.429
She married in 1912

30:32.431 --> 30:35.666
to a blue-collar farmer
named Milton Bryan.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.801
So the expert I spoke to
said that

30:37.803 --> 30:40.303
she thought that
Milton and Blanche's

30:40.305 --> 30:42.438
relationship
was pretty rotten

30:42.440 --> 30:43.607
because she spent
a lot of time

30:43.609 --> 30:45.475
going back to
her parents' house,

30:45.477 --> 30:47.411
blaming mysterious illnesses.

30:47.413 --> 30:48.645
It could have been
depression

30:48.647 --> 30:50.580
or some other kind of
mental illness.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.182
We're not sure.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.485
Now, in 1916, their daughter
Lorraine was born.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.988
They didn't have a second kid
for almost eight years.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.289
Her name was Mavis.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.992
Now, the baby was sickly,
and she died three months later

31:01.994 --> 31:04.728
on April 8th, 1924.

31:04.730 --> 31:06.263
It was too much for Blanche.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.398
That same day,
she took a.32 revolver

31:08.400 --> 31:11.969
and put it to her forehead
and blew her brains out.

31:11.971 --> 31:13.737
My God.

31:13.739 --> 31:17.674
She was only 33 years old
at the time.

31:17.676 --> 31:20.777
Amy, you said the woman
you saw didn't die here.

31:20.779 --> 31:25.015
Blanche died at her
parents' house one county over.

31:25.017 --> 31:27.016
Now, can this blond woman
you saw

31:27.018 --> 31:28.618
mess with
the living people here?

31:28.620 --> 31:31.554
Yes. I got that she affects
the living in several ways.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.757
First, she makes people
sick to their stomachs,

31:33.759 --> 31:34.992
so there's nausea.

31:34.994 --> 31:37.994
She can give you
massive headaches.

31:37.996 --> 31:39.763
Terrible headaches.

31:39.765 --> 31:41.365
- Okay.
- Terrible, terrible headaches.

31:41.367 --> 31:45.235
It just feels like my brains
are smashing against my skull.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.703
She can get physical --

31:46.705 --> 31:48.771
like just shoving people
or pushing people,

31:48.773 --> 31:51.975
also pinching people
while they're sleeping.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.443
You know, I didn't
want to bring it up,

31:53.445 --> 31:55.278
but you had some
inappropriate touching.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.114
Correct.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.748
It's hard for me
to describe, but, like,

31:58.750 --> 32:01.785
I would sleep,
and I would wake up

32:01.787 --> 32:04.121
feeling as though

32:04.123 --> 32:08.458
someone was touching me
inappropriately.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.859
Like, after that happened,

32:09.861 --> 32:11.394
it just, like,
kept reoccurring.

32:11.396 --> 32:14.131
It happened like
at least four or five times.

32:14.133 --> 32:18.602
I don't understand.
What have I done?

32:18.604 --> 32:22.004
So, this blond lady
do anything else?

32:22.006 --> 32:23.573
What I saw
was her messing with

32:23.575 --> 32:25.809
somebody in the bedroom
with two beds,

32:25.811 --> 32:29.312
and she did say she hates
the people in that room.

32:29.314 --> 32:31.581
She was hovering over
someone who was sleeping

32:31.583 --> 32:34.050
and trying to smother them.

32:34.052 --> 32:36.320
I had a sketch done
of what I saw.

32:46.165 --> 32:49.032
Geez.

33:04.082 --> 33:06.516
My God.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.852
My God.

33:08.854 --> 33:11.121
My granddaughter
sleeps in that room.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.056
You think that's your
granddaughter in that bed?

33:19.398 --> 33:22.199
All right,
so I'm gonna get on to

33:22.201 --> 33:24.801
the other deceased
individual that's here.

33:24.803 --> 33:29.373
So, this is a dead male --
extremely present here.

33:29.375 --> 33:32.675
I got that he's an older
white male with white hair.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.078
I got that he was
either a family member

33:35.080 --> 33:37.914
or friend of
a living male who's here.

33:37.916 --> 33:40.617
I got that this male
died from a heart attack.

33:40.619 --> 33:43.620
Felt like this
happened recently.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.721
One thing that
stood out about him

33:45.723 --> 33:48.357
was that he's extremely
worried about his children.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.926
When he's around,
you'd feel like

33:49.928 --> 33:52.229
you need to get
out of the house.

33:52.231 --> 33:55.331
And he does this
on purpose

33:55.333 --> 33:58.301
because he's trying to send
a warning to the living

33:58.303 --> 34:01.438
about something even more
dangerous that's here.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.707
He's trying to tell you
to help save yourselves.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.442
Well, I got
a pretty good idea

34:06.444 --> 34:08.712
who she's talking about.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.513
His name was Lloyd Ferris.
Yep.

34:10.514 --> 34:13.850
And he was a friend of
Minou and her family

34:13.851 --> 34:15.752
for a very long time.

34:15.754 --> 34:19.322
The spare bedroom he slept in
is where Jon sleeps in now.

34:19.324 --> 34:21.724
Now, he wound up living here
for about 10 years, right?

34:21.726 --> 34:23.159
- Something like that.
- Yeah.

34:23.161 --> 34:24.793
Yeah,
he was like one of us.

34:24.795 --> 34:28.197
Now, in March of 1995,

34:28.199 --> 34:30.132
he died of a heart attack
in that room.

34:31.268 --> 34:33.503
So I got his death
certificate here.

34:35.940 --> 34:37.540
I feel fine
with him here.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.242
I mean, he's trying
to protect us.

34:39.244 --> 34:42.178
But I'd like to
see him move on.

34:42.179 --> 34:45.214
So, it sounds like Lloyd
is trying to warn them.

34:45.216 --> 34:47.216
Warn them
about what, though?

34:50.755 --> 34:52.054
It's kind of weird.

34:52.056 --> 34:56.025
So, I'm in the backyard.
I see a bunch of things.

34:56.027 --> 35:00.696
And they looked like
really large rats.

35:00.698 --> 35:02.265
So there's about
20 of them,

35:02.267 --> 35:06.769
and they've formed
a perimeter around the house,

35:06.771 --> 35:10.540
and what they do is
they attract negative energy

35:10.542 --> 35:12.642
and trap it
inside the house.

35:12.644 --> 35:13.844
Being surrounded by
the negative energy

35:13.846 --> 35:15.645
can cause physical illness.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.847
I got nausea,
again, vomiting,

35:17.849 --> 35:19.749
diarrhea,
and feeling drained.

35:19.751 --> 35:22.318
Well, Minou, let's talk
about you being nauseated.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.521
Sometimes
I just get nauseated,

35:24.523 --> 35:25.922
can't eat,

35:25.924 --> 35:28.591
and I'm just exhausted --

35:28.593 --> 35:31.995
just completely exhausted

35:31.997 --> 35:35.332
for no reason.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.600
Now, Shannon, you told me
about being drained.

35:37.602 --> 35:41.605
Yeah. I mean, even tonight,
I'm physically just worn out.

35:41.607 --> 35:43.740
I just want to leave.

35:43.742 --> 35:47.210
This negative energy can also
affect people's moods

35:47.212 --> 35:50.079
and change
their personalities.

35:50.081 --> 35:51.814
I know I've been told
by two people

35:51.816 --> 35:53.883
I'm crushing
their spirits...

35:53.885 --> 35:55.518
No.

35:58.456 --> 36:01.825
...because I'm so mean.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.227
I don't mean to be mean.

36:07.099 --> 36:10.767
I try so hard.

36:10.769 --> 36:13.637
But I had Shannon tell me
I was crushing her spirit,

36:13.639 --> 36:18.107
and then my son told me
the same thing.

36:18.109 --> 36:20.109
Jon's personality
has changed, as well.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.211
Yeah.

36:21.213 --> 36:24.848
Dealing with it --
it's just killing me.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.782
It's just killing me.

36:26.784 --> 36:30.453
I'm tired of
living through all this.

36:30.455 --> 36:31.787
What I'm curious about

36:31.789 --> 36:33.756
is what these little
rat bastards look like.

36:33.758 --> 36:35.592
I did have a sketch done.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.371
You weren't kidding,
were you?

36:53.478 --> 36:54.744
What's that?

36:58.683 --> 37:02.552
Is this black, swirly stuff
the bad energy?

37:02.554 --> 37:05.021
- Yes.
- Okay.

37:05.023 --> 37:06.823
Jon mentioned to me
about seeing

37:06.825 --> 37:10.293
some kind of
a swirly energy...

37:10.295 --> 37:11.427
that was white.

37:11.429 --> 37:13.430
Ä°nteresting.

37:13.432 --> 37:17.099
Now, have these things
always been here?

37:17.101 --> 37:19.836
They were brought here
by a living person,

37:19.838 --> 37:25.508
and I don't think this happened
too, too long ago.

37:25.510 --> 37:27.944
This person
was into witchcraft...

37:27.946 --> 37:29.979
My God.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.449
...dark magic.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.851
Well, we all know who
she's talking about.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.453
Yep.

37:38.990 --> 37:42.058
Well, Minou, want to tell her
about Jon's girlfriend?

37:42.060 --> 37:44.727
She came over here,
spent the night,

37:44.729 --> 37:48.130
and said she had seven
different personalities.

37:48.132 --> 37:51.601
Did he want to see them?

37:51.603 --> 37:54.603
And he said, when they
started coming out...
What?!

37:54.605 --> 37:56.272
...he got
very, very scared,

37:56.274 --> 37:59.109
and he thought
they were demons.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.443
Holy...

38:00.445 --> 38:02.878
Things, like,
started getting bad.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.881
He called her
and asked her

38:05.883 --> 38:07.884
if she dealt
in the occult at all,

38:07.886 --> 38:09.285
and she told him yes.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.820
Ohhhhhh!
What?!

38:10.822 --> 38:12.155
She admitted it?

38:12.157 --> 38:14.924
I, then, started
getting attacked.

38:14.926 --> 38:16.392
No.

38:16.394 --> 38:20.363
Do we think she brought
these rat things here?

38:20.365 --> 38:22.766
Yes.

38:22.768 --> 38:26.002
Like, it is so, so bad.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.938
That's my little baby.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.640
I can't even imagine now

38:30.642 --> 38:33.376
the torture
he's going through

38:33.378 --> 38:36.045
with all this...going on.

38:51.796 --> 38:53.063
So, Minou,
the other day you told me

38:53.065 --> 38:55.031
you felt like
you were living in hell.
Yep.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.267
And turns out
you really are.

38:57.269 --> 39:00.270
So now we need to find out if
there's any way to fix this mess

39:00.272 --> 39:01.337
so you guys can stay here.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.339
For that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.746
It's not an easy fix,
I'll tell you that.

39:09.748 --> 39:12.716
Okay, so the first thing
I would like to see y'all do

39:12.718 --> 39:15.050
is to get a male medium

39:15.052 --> 39:17.821
to move on the blond woman
and Lloyd,

39:17.823 --> 39:19.355
somebody like Steve --

39:19.357 --> 39:21.658
very old-school,
old-fashioned.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.793
The reason why
this male has to be

39:23.795 --> 39:27.197
that specific way
is more for the female...

39:27.199 --> 39:30.833
...because she's old-school.

39:30.835 --> 39:33.937
Once that happens,
she's gonna run out of here

39:33.939 --> 39:38.074
'cause she does not
want to be here.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.743
And then he can move
Lloyd on, as well,

39:40.745 --> 39:43.612
and all he needs to be
assured of, basically,

39:43.614 --> 39:47.450
is that y'all got his message,
and he will leave.

39:47.452 --> 39:48.684
So that's number one.

39:48.686 --> 39:52.922
Now, here's
what's gonna suck.

39:52.924 --> 39:56.025
So, I would like you
to see a voodoo priest.

39:56.027 --> 39:58.328
This girl placed a curse
on this house

39:58.330 --> 40:00.530
and brought
these things here.

40:00.532 --> 40:02.465
Fight fire with fire.

40:02.467 --> 40:06.936
When you're dealing
with the darkness,

40:06.938 --> 40:11.141
you need someone to
counteract that darkness.

40:11.143 --> 40:14.911
He can remove this.

40:16.681 --> 40:19.749
So, now, once the voodoo priest
comes in and does his thing,

40:19.751 --> 40:21.217
it'll get rid of
these rat creatures

40:21.219 --> 40:22.986
or whatever the hell
they are?

40:22.988 --> 40:25.688
- Yes.
- Okay.

40:25.690 --> 40:27.590
All right, so let me
ask you a question.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.359
Do you think your son will go
see this voodoo priest?

40:29.361 --> 40:32.161
- I don't know.
- Here's the thing.

40:32.163 --> 40:36.299
If he won't do it,
he'd have to go away.

40:36.301 --> 40:38.968
He could <i> not</i> come back,

40:38.970 --> 40:43.840
especially after
you have the rituals done.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.274
Well, listen,
you know your son

40:45.276 --> 40:47.643
better than anybody else.

40:47.645 --> 40:49.045
What's the story?

40:49.047 --> 40:50.380
Do you think you're gonna
be able to convince him

40:50.382 --> 40:53.249
to get this done
and be part of it?

40:53.251 --> 40:57.019
I'm gonna have to.
I don't have a choice.

40:57.021 --> 40:59.756
You got to try.
You can't live like this.

40:59.758 --> 41:01.657
No, I can't.

41:01.659 --> 41:03.326
This is something
that's fixable.

41:03.328 --> 41:04.828
This has to be fixed.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.164
<i>He</i> has to be fixed.

41:10.569 --> 41:14.337
I'm gonna be
on his ass about it.

41:14.339 --> 41:18.608
Either he goes,
or I'm gonna have to go.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.676
It's gonna be
one or the other,

41:20.678 --> 41:23.279
'cause I'm not gonna
live like this anymore.

41:23.281 --> 41:25.748
I'm <i> not</i> gonna do it.

41:30.755 --> 41:32.622
I really hope Minou
convinces Jon

41:32.624 --> 41:34.357
to see a voodoo priest.

41:34.359 --> 41:37.827
If he does, the rat creatures
and negative energy will leave.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.495
And with the help of a medium,

41:39.497 --> 41:41.363
the dead blonde
and their friend Lloyd

41:41.365 --> 41:43.032
can be moved on, as well,

41:43.034 --> 41:46.469
and this family can find
the peace it's been looking for.
