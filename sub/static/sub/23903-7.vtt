00:09.927 --> 00:11.247
You want in? You gotta deal wit.

00:12.221 --> 00:13.595
Thought I was justgonna let hey

00:13.639 --> 00:15.347
with trying to kill me?

00:15.391 --> 00:16.265
Someone dropped her on my doo.

00:16.308 --> 00:19.101
We had nothingto do with this.

00:19.145 --> 00:20.352
B?

00:20.396 --> 00:23.105
Look, it was Hammondl was leve.

00:23.149 --> 00:24.440
Any money I got off of him wa.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.775
- Where do we go from here?
- No.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.527
Where are you from?-Monterrey.

00:28.571 --> 00:29.945
Which part?-The nice part.

00:29.989 --> 00:32.656
Does she talk to you much abou?

00:32.700 --> 00:33.760
Just seemed a little evasive.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.826
Damn it, you have not seen me

00:35.870 --> 00:36.702
or your son in almost 11 months.

00:36.746 --> 00:38.954
Look, I don't have a choice.

00:38.998 --> 00:42.249
I'm not living like this. No.

00:42.293 --> 00:43.584
Chemo is still your best bet.

00:43.627 --> 00:46.837
All the other doctorscould off,

00:46.881 --> 00:49.006
maybe temporary, maybe not at al.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.591
We need to get herback in real.

00:50.634 --> 00:51.717
She's not gonna listen.

00:51.761 --> 00:53.135
Recently, the FBI came to us

00:53.179 --> 00:55.971
to help locate the sourceof WMD.

00:56.015 --> 00:58.891
We followed the trail back to I,

00:58.934 --> 01:00.768
an exemployeeof Helixa Corpora.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.478
Where are they? I asked you

01:02.521 --> 01:03.801
to keep them safe, not make 'em.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.607
When I know you're clearof tro.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.067
I don't like us working with.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.861
He's the key to us getting rid.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.446
He's willingto give out the locn

01:12.490 --> 01:13.614
of Winters' WMD stash.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.783
You sell it, pure profit, we ta.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.409
I guess Hammond wasn't lying.

01:17.453 --> 01:18.453
FBI!-Freeze!

01:23.000 --> 01:24.541
Dad's been workingon the others

01:24.585 --> 01:25.501
about kicking you out.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.377
I'm calling a vote.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.754
Who's with me?

01:29.673 --> 01:30.713

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, !

02:18.180 --> 02:21.014
Don't get comfortable. We ain't.

02:24.979 --> 02:30.858
But when we are, I'm gonna make.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.527
Every lastmotherfucking one of.

03:00.139 --> 03:04.183
I don't think I want
to answer that question.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.144
None of my business?

03:07.188 --> 03:10.898
Just a boring topic.
I don't like being bored.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.419
And talking about yourself
bores you?

03:12.443 --> 03:15.903
- Well, I already know about me.
- But I don't.

03:15.946 --> 03:19.031
So this is
an interrogation then?

03:19.074 --> 03:21.992
Okay, Officer.
Name is Catherine Ann Miller,

03:22.036 --> 03:23.869
birthday is September 2nd,
28 years old.

03:23.913 --> 03:26.705
I'm more interested
in what you...

03:26.749 --> 03:30.000
What do you look for in a guy?

03:30.044 --> 03:32.794
And what if I told you
I like shy men?

03:32.838 --> 03:34.118
I'll see if I can find you one.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.387
Thank you.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.978
Maybe him?

03:53.150 --> 03:54.990
You're gonna have to find
a new line of work.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.444
So it matters to youwhat a man?

03:57.488 --> 03:59.488
It matters what he has t

03:59.531 --> 04:01.531
when he comes home.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.952
That guy, it's probably an idi,

04:04.995 --> 04:06.995
his arrogant chef, some smarmy m.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.747
And if I had to listen to thato-

04:08.791 --> 04:09.998
I'd stick my head in the oven.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.963
What about you?

04:16.005 --> 04:19.341
I like women who know what t.

04:19.385 --> 04:23.971
I don't talk shop to civilians, ,

04:24.014 --> 04:25.294

04:31.981 --> 04:33.208
Your table's ready. If you'll f.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.982
Sure.

05:03.012 --> 05:05.137
I have hired a lawyer. And my w.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.055
But I'm stuck on the other side.

05:07.099 --> 05:11.184
No, we'll haveto postpone it an-

05:11.228 --> 05:13.854
What's the goddamn rush?

05:13.897 --> 05:14.688
If she wants to throw away six,

05:14.732 --> 05:16.982
she can wait a few months to...

05:17.026 --> 05:20.861
I'm sure you don't give a shit, ,

05:20.904 --> 05:22.571
I love my wifeand I don't want.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.989
I don't want a divorce.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.534
I want her to calm down,

05:27.578 --> 05:29.870
wait till I finish this assignm,

05:29.913 --> 05:32.664
then we can sit down and we c.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.125
Well, that's a nonstarter.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.668
There's no way in hellshe's gety

05:36.712 --> 05:38.170
of my child.-Get in here.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.504
Now.

05:39.548 --> 05:42.591
I'll call you back.

05:42.634 --> 05:43.925
"Four Killedin Abortive FBI Ra".

05:43.969 --> 05:48.013

05:48.057 --> 05:51.016
"Crime LordEscapes FBI Dragnet."

05:53.812 --> 05:56.021
Shall I go on?-I wasn't there.

05:56.065 --> 05:58.440
I'm fully aware whowas in.

05:58.484 --> 05:59.484
That's not fair.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.611
The truth never is.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.196
That doesn't excuseyour part in.

06:04.239 --> 06:08.533
All you've done is allow a bunc,

06:08.577 --> 06:12.162
and now Tom Hammondhas taken ov.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.707
In our defense, we shut down W.

06:15.751 --> 06:18.085
We will get him under control.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.504
The only way to do that is toy

06:20.547 --> 06:23.924
and then indict him.

06:23.967 --> 06:27.302
That way, we're drivingthe car.

06:27.346 --> 06:28.346
Now leave.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.644
Tom Hammond killed Winters?

06:35.687 --> 06:39.106
Yeah. I just found out.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.149
Why didn't you say anythingin?

06:41.193 --> 06:42.943
I was called in becauseRyder w.

You really want meto drop that I

06:44.822 --> 06:46.488
in his officebefore I told you?

06:46.532 --> 06:48.865
Do you have proof?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.409
Hammond was therewhen Tom shot.

06:50.452 --> 06:53.578
Son of a bitch.

06:53.622 --> 06:56.373
Where's the body? I don't know.

07:00.129 --> 07:02.379
You want to tell mehow the help

07:02.423 --> 07:03.672

07:03.715 --> 07:05.006
Watch how you talk to me. I'vt

07:05.050 --> 07:08.135
from people today, I'm notabout.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.970
Someone's got to knowwhere Nec.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.930
We've been shakingeverything t,

07:11.974 --> 07:13.294
so if they know, they ain't tell.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.423
We need to sweepyour father in.

07:19.648 --> 07:20.981
He's not gonna play ball.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.277
I know about Winters.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.325
You knew I'd have to report i.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.000
I'm not testifying, so all you.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.173
Analytics tracked the sourceof.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.384
Chemical signature leads to aph.

07:49.428 --> 07:52.304
Couple more tests to be sure,.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.055
I don't give a shit abouta dir,

07:54.099 --> 07:56.600
but I do care about your father,

07:56.643 --> 07:58.018
so you got two choices.

07:58.061 --> 08:01.021
You can either bring him in lin.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.984
Piece of shit.

08:06.028 --> 08:08.695
You're really gonna ignorethe?

08:08.739 --> 08:11.072
Of course not, but Hammonddoes.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.020
How close are theyto rearrest?

08:22.044 --> 08:25.003
Closer thanl'm comfortable wit.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.845
I can see it in Byrd's eyes.He.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.554
But if Price getswhat she wants,

08:35.599 --> 08:38.390
she will fuck us over.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.102
And the only thing that mightstt

08:41.145 --> 08:44.814
is if we can get Tom to stepasi.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.651
That's not gonna happe.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.028
Your old man's out for blood

08:50.072 --> 08:51.312
and he's not gonna stop until.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.565
Roll down the window.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.990
Ain't this a bitch?

09:53.927 --> 09:58.972
Give me a minute. Right the.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.975
Maybe we should call your dad?

10:02.019 --> 10:03.310
He could always getthis thing w.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.978
I got it.

10:06.732 --> 10:12.027
Anyway... what's the rush, Ma?

10:12.070 --> 10:14.112
I want to get the house in w.

10:14.156 --> 10:18.992
Honey, I'm sure if I called him.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.286
Nope, we don't need him. I almo.

10:21.330 --> 10:24.080
I just...

10:24.124 --> 10:26.333
You're tightening that do.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.084
The moment you turn it on, it'll.

10:33.091 --> 10:36.676
So what you meant to sayis tha.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.011
I'm gonna get the laundry.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.977
We should talk.

10:47.356 --> 10:48.980
About what?

10:51.902 --> 10:52.609
Dad, I just don't want you to-

10:52.653 --> 10:55.362
- No, you made your choice.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.405
Live with it.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.830
I don't know. Maybe you shouldn.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.999
I didn't just come about this,.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.003
I came to see you.

11:15.384 --> 11:17.801
You came...

11:17.844 --> 11:21.930
because you feel guilt.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.473
It's not an emotion you're used.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.309
Yeah.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.977
Yeah, you're right.

11:34.569 --> 11:38.321
I wish... I wish I could fix thi.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.008
No, it's...

12:01.930 --> 12:04.013
I'm not speakingabout this marr.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.987
I wish it was me.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.992
It's not fair.

12:34.713 --> 12:37.005
It's not meant to be fair.

12:39.342 --> 12:42.177
It's okay.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.235
I told you he was holdin.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.988
Get it?

13:02.032 --> 13:05.992
I'm not getting that shit. Y.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.544
I'm gonna flick it out withthis.

Coming at you, Tiny.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.673
Hey, hey, man, get the hell ou,

13:20.717 --> 13:22.008

- Come on.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.977
On second thought, keep it.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.397
Ain't nothing in this world.

13:36.441 --> 13:39.025
So what's up?

13:39.069 --> 13:40.860
We're looking for Neckbone, ?

13:40.904 --> 13:42.224
Nah. And what went downthe oth,

13:43.114 --> 13:45.073

13:51.623 --> 13:52.997
Come here. Come here.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.043
You got my number, right? Yeah.

You owe me, Tiny, you owe me.

14:04.261 --> 14:06.010
Yeah.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.560
Foster must havetipped off Nec.

14:13.603 --> 14:16.896
No, I don't think so.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.858
But he knewno matter what he cl,

14:19.901 --> 14:20.775
Neckbone was eventually gonnae

14:20.819 --> 14:23.862
behind Winters'WMD involvement.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.905
That's why he helped set him up.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.157
Yeah, we couldn't change his m.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.118
No.

14:30.161 --> 14:34.455
Either way, we're all at risk.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.666
He's on his own.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.586
No backup. We'll find him.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.004
Yeah, or he'll find us.
