00:10.321 --> 00:11.455
I've been trying to get my mom

00:11.489 --> 00:13.689
- To check into a rehab center.
- How much?

00:13.724 --> 00:15.524
- Four grand.
- Son, I just don't have it.

00:15.559 --> 00:16.859
I got you, man.

00:16.893 --> 00:18.861
Her bail will be $4,000.

00:18.895 --> 00:19.996
Here you go.

00:20.030 --> 00:21.364
Your father told me what's happened.

00:21.398 --> 00:22.531
It's okay, luke.

00:22.566 --> 00:24.533
We'll figure out what to do.

00:24.568 --> 00:26.936
So I woke up this morning
and I'm still pregnant.

00:26.970 --> 00:28.170
Give me your hand.

00:28.205 --> 00:30.773
Trust me for once.

00:30.807 --> 00:31.774
Everything all right?

00:31.808 --> 00:32.942
I need your help.

00:32.976 --> 00:34.343
For a local adoption agency.

00:34.378 --> 00:36.178
What if I don't want to have the baby?

00:36.213 --> 00:39.815
I can direct you to literature for that.

00:39.850 --> 00:41.951
But you're gonna need
to talk to your mom.

00:41.985 --> 00:47.590
i>- And we're back at 1040
a-m el fuego.

00:47.624 --> 00:49.558
And we got a caller on the line

00:49.593 --> 00:53.396
At lion's pride radio
with el ray de la silva.

00:53.430 --> 00:55.364
Coach eric taylor.

00:55.399 --> 00:57.400
What do you got, caller?

00:57.434 --> 00:59.502
I'd like to ask coach taylor
what he plans on doing

00:59.536 --> 01:02.238
To shut down j.D. Mccoy.

01:02.272 --> 01:04.407
Well--well, to tell you the truth,

01:04.441 --> 01:06.008
We're gonna be wel
l-prepared for the panthers,

01:06.043 --> 01:07.410
But that game is two weeks out

01:07.444 --> 01:09.345
And right now we're
focusing on Friday's game.

01:09.379 --> 01:10.780
So thank you for calling.

01:10.814 --> 01:12.748
Yeah, but, coach,
just between you and me

01:12.783 --> 01:14.850
And those thousands of
listeners out there,

01:14.885 --> 01:16.218
What will you do next week

01:16.253 --> 01:19.588
To combat that panthers' passing attack?

01:19.623 --> 01:21.190
How will you do it?

01:21.224 --> 01:23.559
Well, buddy, what we're gonna do

01:23.593 --> 01:26.062
Is we're gonna face the panthers
just like any other team.

01:26.096 --> 01:27.563
But right now we've got the
wescott game on the table

01:27.597 --> 01:29.965
And that's the game I'm thinking about

01:30.000 --> 01:31.534
And that's the game
that I'd like my players

01:31.568 --> 01:32.968
To be thinking about.

01:33.003 --> 01:34.804
And that's what we'll be thinking about

01:34.838 --> 01:37.907
<i>Here at el fuego,
the wescott game.</i>

01:37.941 --> 01:39.775
-Uh, yeah, coach-
-we're about to lose coach taylor,

01:39.810 --> 01:41.410
So call in right now.

01:41.445 --> 01:43.913
<i>El fuego 1040 a-m.</i>

01:43.947 --> 01:46.716
I just filled this last week.

01:46.750 --> 01:48.584
I lost 'em.

01:48.618 --> 01:49.719
You lost 'em?

01:49.753 --> 01:51.120
Yeah.

01:51.154 --> 01:54.490
Well, I'm not filling it again, son.

01:54.524 --> 01:56.992
I got a huge game coming up.
I need these.

01:57.027 --> 01:58.227
Look, do I need to call somebody

01:58.261 --> 01:59.795

01:59.830 --> 02:01.330
Like your coach or your parents?

02:01.365 --> 02:03.232
No.

02:03.266 --> 02:04.367
Do you want to tell me what's happening

02:04.401 --> 02:05.434
To those pills then?

02:05.469 --> 02:06.669
I lost them. I'll find them.

02:39.770 --> 02:41.437
There was just something
about building that house

02:41.471 --> 02:44.306
That was just so hands-on and rewarding.

02:44.341 --> 02:45.574
Little addicting, huh?

02:45.609 --> 02:46.909
Yeah, a little bit.

02:46.943 --> 02:48.411
I would love to do more.

02:48.445 --> 02:50.012
I just keeping thinking
about that family

02:50.046 --> 02:52.181
And how happy they were to move in.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.717
Going through a training
program is quite a commitment.

02:54.751 --> 02:56.152
It's a lot of work.

02:56.186 --> 02:57.453
Are you able to make
that kind of commitment

02:57.487 --> 02:58.587
Over the next few years?

02:58.622 --> 03:00.089
We would be training you
to be a team leader.

03:00.123 --> 03:01.824
Yeah, definitely.

03:01.858 --> 03:03.826
Now you're 17, right?

03:03.860 --> 03:05.494
- Uh
-huh.

03:05.529 --> 03:07.163
So we'll need a parental consent.

03:07.197 --> 03:08.831
Is that gonna be a problem?

03:08.865 --> 03:11.066
No, not at all.

03:11.101 --> 03:12.468
Good.

03:21.678 --> 03:22.711
Hi.

03:22.746 --> 03:24.680

03:27.551 --> 03:28.651
Luke's mom.

03:28.685 --> 03:31.454
Uh, I know it's probably odd,

03:31.488 --> 03:33.155
Me being here like this,

03:33.190 --> 03:36.125
But I just really wanted
to come over and meet you.

03:36.159 --> 03:39.862
You know, extend a hand, tell you that

03:39.896 --> 03:42.865
I'm really sorry about what
you've had to go through...

03:42.899 --> 03:45.668
And to tell you that I wish
I could have been there

03:45.702 --> 03:48.838
For you to help you.

03:48.872 --> 03:51.040
Thank you.

03:51.074 --> 03:55.511
Do you have maybe a few
minutes to talk to me

03:55.545 --> 03:57.379
And tell me about what happened?

03:57.414 --> 04:02.985
I mean, just to help
me understand better.

04:03.019 --> 04:04.787
Yeah.

04:04.821 --> 04:06.055
Yeah. Come on in.

04:06.089 --> 04:07.323
Thanks.

04:09.059 --> 04:10.326
* *

04:10.360 --> 04:12.161
Sit back there,
look simple if you want to.

04:12.195 --> 04:13.462
You know I'm telling the truth.

04:13.497 --> 04:15.130
All I'm saying is you better have

04:15.165 --> 04:16.499
Your game plan tight or you gon' get

04:16.533 --> 04:18.166
Your asses kicked in
that panthers' game.

04:18.201 --> 04:19.902
Yeah, okay.

04:19.935 --> 04:21.170
Yo, which one is it though, man?

04:21.204 --> 04:23.072
Yo, that's it right here.

04:23.106 --> 04:24.440
Pull up right here.

04:24.474 --> 04:26.909
Let's go collect, gentlemen.

04:26.943 --> 04:28.377
Get the guns.

04:28.411 --> 04:29.879
kill him.

04:39.623 --> 04:40.589
That's not how you do business.

04:40.624 --> 04:41.957
Ah!

04:41.992 --> 04:43.759
You think I'm cutting up
all these cars for charity?

04:43.793 --> 04:44.793
Oh, hell no.

04:44.828 --> 04:45.928
You got your parts.

04:45.962 --> 04:47.229
I get my money.

04:47.230 --> 04:49.798
You got 24 hours or it's gon' get ugly.

05:07.951 --> 05:09.718
What the hell was that in there, man?

05:09.753 --> 05:11.253
You buy a ticket so you can just watch?

05:11.288 --> 05:13.622
You supposed to help!

05:13.657 --> 05:14.857
You an idiot, junior.

05:14.891 --> 05:16.659
Look, how long am I
supposed to be doing this

05:16.693 --> 05:17.960
Till we're even, till we're square?

05:17.994 --> 05:19.495
Yo, rehab ain't cheap, man.

05:19.529 --> 05:20.829
I'll let you know.

05:20.864 --> 05:23.866
Get in the car.

05:23.900 --> 05:24.967
Let's go.

05:27.771 --> 05:30.472
What will you do next week to combat

05:30.507 --> 05:32.207
That panthers' passing attack?

05:32.242 --> 05:33.676
How will you do it?

05:33.710 --> 05:35.711
What we're gonna do is we're
gonna face the panthers

05:35.745 --> 05:38.113
Like we face any other team,
but right now

05:38.148 --> 05:40.115
The game on the table
is the wescott game,

05:40.150 --> 05:41.383
So what we're trying
to do is we're trying

05:41.418 --> 05:43.419
To focus on the wescott game.

05:43.453 --> 05:45.020
That's the game I'm thinking about

05:45.055 --> 05:46.755
And that's the game
that I'd like my players

05:46.790 --> 05:48.057
To be thinking about.

05:48.091 --> 05:49.725
And that's what we'll be thinking about

05:49.759 --> 05:52.761
<i>Here at el fuego...</i>

05:52.796 --> 05:54.797
On your a.M. Dial.

06:44.981 --> 06:48.150
Your focus has got to be on today.

06:48.184 --> 06:50.519
Your focus has got to be
on practice this week.

06:50.553 --> 06:52.921
Your focus has got to be on Friday.

06:52.956 --> 06:54.289
Nothing else.

06:54.324 --> 06:55.658
Is that understood?

06:55.692 --> 06:56.925
Yes, sir!

06:56.960 --> 07:00.029
'cause I guarantee you wescott's focus

07:00.063 --> 07:03.632
Is gonna be coming down
here and kicking our asses

07:03.667 --> 07:04.733
And it's not gonna happen.

07:04.768 --> 07:06.001
Yes, sir!

07:06.036 --> 07:07.803
Let's go have a good practice. Let's go.

07:16.046 --> 07:17.546
Way to bring the wood!

07:17.580 --> 07:19.415
Huddle up, guys. Let's go! Huddle up!

07:21.618 --> 07:23.485
Huddle up!

07:23.520 --> 07:24.753
Huddle up!

07:24.788 --> 07:26.355
- You all right, man?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:26.389 --> 07:27.923
I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Yeah.

07:27.957 --> 07:29.358
You sure you all right?

07:29.392 --> 07:31.593
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right.

07:34.597 --> 07:36.298
You good? You got it?

07:36.332 --> 07:38.267
Yep.

07:38.301 --> 07:39.868
Hey, coach, let's give 'em five.

07:39.903 --> 07:41.070
All right, water! Let's go!

07:41.104 --> 07:42.538
Jog it off! Water! Let's go!

08:04.461 --> 08:07.062
Okay.

08:07.097 --> 08:08.597
Uh, oh, my god.

08:08.631 --> 08:11.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:11.334 --> 08:13.736
We don't normally take cash deposits,

08:13.770 --> 08:15.704
But what did you-- did you rob a bank?

08:15.739 --> 08:18.207
You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?

08:20.009 --> 08:21.877
I'm just kidding. I didn't rob a bank.

08:21.911 --> 08:22.878
Yeah, okay.

08:22.912 --> 08:24.880
Well, I tell you what.

08:24.914 --> 08:26.381
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna, um--

08:26.416 --> 08:29.485
I'm gonna submit your offer
and I'll let you know

08:29.519 --> 08:30.586
As soon as I hear.

08:30.620 --> 08:31.653
Great.

08:31.688 --> 08:32.721
Thank you.

08:32.756 --> 08:35.524
Okay, see ya.

08:35.558 --> 08:36.892
Ooh!

08:36.926 --> 08:40.596
Luke cafferty's mother is
trying to get you fired.

08:40.630 --> 08:42.231
Why?

08:42.265 --> 08:44.099
Because he got transferred
to east dillon?

08:44.134 --> 08:45.234
No, no.

08:45.268 --> 08:47.736
Because apparently you instructed a girl

08:47.771 --> 08:50.506
Who was carrying her grandchild,
at least in her words,

08:50.540 --> 08:52.941
To have an abortion.

08:52.976 --> 08:54.143
What?

08:54.177 --> 08:55.644
Did this happen?

08:55.678 --> 08:59.314
Uh, I--I had a
conversation with the girl,

08:59.349 --> 09:03.018
But I never instructed
anyone to do anything.

09:03.052 --> 09:05.154
What did you say exactly?

09:05.188 --> 09:07.156
Well, paul, you know that that
conversation is confidential,

09:07.190 --> 09:09.992
But listen, this girl came to me.

09:10.026 --> 09:11.527
Uh, she sought me out.

09:11.561 --> 09:12.828
It was not on school grounds.

09:12.862 --> 09:14.229
She's not even one of my students

09:14.264 --> 09:15.764
And I followed protocol.

09:15.799 --> 09:18.767
There's going to be a hearing
with you and the school board.

09:18.802 --> 09:21.270
On what grounds?

09:21.304 --> 09:22.538
Well, the fact is this
is a hot-button issue

09:22.572 --> 09:24.506
And we have a parent
who's willing to say

09:24.541 --> 09:25.674
Or do anything to be heard.

09:25.708 --> 09:27.309
You know there are certain
people on the board

09:27.343 --> 09:29.845
Who have very strong
feelings about this, tami.

09:29.879 --> 09:34.116
This has turned into a
very serious situation.

09:34.150 --> 09:36.985
I mean, well, you know,
how much do they know about me?

09:37.020 --> 09:39.454
Like, do your parents know I'm black?

09:39.489 --> 09:41.557
Why does that even matter?

09:41.591 --> 09:43.292
I just--I know it sounds silly,

09:43.326 --> 09:45.694
But I just ask 'cause I'd like to know

09:45.728 --> 09:48.463
What I'm walking into with these
kind of situations, you know?

09:48.498 --> 09:50.566
Well, I can tell you you're walking into

09:50.600 --> 09:52.534
Some very hit-or-miss cooking.

09:52.569 --> 09:55.704
I think my mom said beef stroganoff.

09:55.738 --> 09:57.372
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

09:57.407 --> 09:58.440
I don't know.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.642
Two parents that really like seeing

10:00.677 --> 10:03.745
Their son happy and want to see

10:03.780 --> 10:05.347
What he's been so happy about.

10:05.381 --> 10:07.182
You've been happy lately?

10:07.217 --> 10:08.517
- Mm
-hmm.

10:19.462 --> 10:21.230
What?

10:22.899 --> 10:26.902
Let's not get too happy in the hallway.

10:26.936 --> 10:29.204
Right. Gotcha.

10:29.239 --> 10:31.240
okay.

10:42.719 --> 10:44.920
Here. I got you.

10:44.954 --> 10:46.221
Thanks, tim. Appreciate it.

10:46.256 --> 10:48.190
Yeah, absolutely.

10:48.224 --> 10:52.594
You got it? All right, here.

10:52.629 --> 10:55.297
Thanks.

10:55.331 --> 10:56.431
There you go.

10:56.466 --> 10:59.201
You know what?

10:59.235 --> 11:00.535
You're all right, tim.

11:00.570 --> 11:02.404
You know, when I picked
you up in that bar,

11:02.438 --> 11:04.907
I had no idea what a good guy you are.

11:04.941 --> 11:08.410
You've really been there and
you been there for my girl

11:08.444 --> 11:13.215
And it's kind of rare,
especially in men, so thanks.

11:13.249 --> 11:15.550
You're like part of the family.

11:15.585 --> 11:16.919
I really appreciate it.

11:16.953 --> 11:19.321
Thank you and...

11:19.355 --> 11:20.789
You're very welcome.

11:20.823 --> 11:23.325
you're okay.

11:23.359 --> 11:25.260
Hey, uh, you know what?

11:25.295 --> 11:27.763
I'm kind of in the mood
to celebrate tonight.

11:27.797 --> 11:29.031
Oh, yeah?

11:29.065 --> 11:30.732
So how about my treat,
take you and becks

11:30.767 --> 11:32.134
Out tonight to dinner?

11:32.168 --> 11:33.635
You kidding me? I'd love that.

11:33.670 --> 11:35.203
- Yeah, let's do it.
- I don't have to cook.

11:35.238 --> 11:38.040
- 6:00.
- 6:00, huh?

11:38.074 --> 11:40.809
- Be ready!
- I will.

11:43.012 --> 11:46.148
Well, what exactly is
it that happened then?

11:46.182 --> 11:47.916
Well, what happened is
I followed protocol.

11:47.951 --> 11:51.119
I did what I am licensed to do,
what I'm supposed to do.

11:51.154 --> 11:54.456
I think the question here is
what are they saying happened.

11:54.490 --> 11:56.124
Well, what did they say happened?

11:56.159 --> 11:58.260
You know what they said happened.

11:58.294 --> 12:00.262
They said that I advised that
girl to have an abortion.

12:00.296 --> 12:02.898
Well, I don't understand
why they'd say that.

12:02.932 --> 12:04.366
I mean, that doesn't make sense.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.068
I know it doesn't make sense.

12:06.102 --> 12:08.236
That's the thing that's
so crazy about it.

12:08.271 --> 12:09.972
Especially since that
girl's mother took her

12:10.006 --> 12:12.975
To get the abortion.

12:13.009 --> 12:14.409
Hey, hon.

12:14.444 --> 12:15.811
You want to do me a big favor tonight?

12:15.845 --> 12:19.881
Could you put your baby
sister to bed for me?

12:19.916 --> 12:21.216
Thank you.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.651
Are you guys okay?

12:22.685 --> 12:24.252
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

12:24.287 --> 12:27.656
Yep.

12:27.690 --> 12:28.757
Good night.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.792
Good night.

12:35.832 --> 12:37.799
Look, they've got butterflies on them.

12:37.834 --> 12:38.934
That makes them exciting.

12:38.968 --> 12:41.536
Hey, you want to go to bed?

12:48.511 --> 12:50.946
No, you don't.

13:04.827 --> 13:06.495
Hello?

13:06.529 --> 13:10.365
Hey, julie.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.001
H-h-how you been?

13:16.806 --> 13:18.173
I--

13:18.207 --> 13:20.809
I can't talk to you right now.

13:37.927 --> 13:41.263
My three little brothers
are still at that cute age.

13:41.297 --> 13:42.497
Oh.

13:42.532 --> 13:44.132
They're ten, eight, and seven.

13:44.167 --> 13:46.034
My goodness.

13:46.069 --> 13:48.804
Your mama must have been busy.

13:48.838 --> 13:49.905
Yeah.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.978
So now what do you think
about obama so far, jess?

14:01.517 --> 14:04.920
I think he's a good president.

14:04.954 --> 14:06.555
- He's a good president.
- Excellent.

14:06.589 --> 14:08.824
Well, I'd have to agree.

14:08.858 --> 14:12.327
Yeah.

14:12.361 --> 14:14.229
This is good. Good.

14:14.263 --> 14:16.364
I love this brown sauce too. It's good.

14:20.369 --> 14:21.636
All right.

14:21.671 --> 14:23.905
Hadn't sunk in even for me,
so buckle up.

14:23.940 --> 14:24.973
All right.

14:25.007 --> 14:26.608
Right now you+re looking

14:26.642 --> 14:31.012
At a proud owner of a
little piece of texas.

14:31.047 --> 14:32.614
you're a landowner?

14:32.648 --> 14:34.349
Congratulations!

14:34.383 --> 14:35.851
Man, that's great.

14:35.885 --> 14:37.185
- Wow!
- Wait.

14:37.220 --> 14:38.286
Where'd you get the money?

14:38.321 --> 14:39.621
Becky.

14:39.655 --> 14:42.357
Um, garrity motors threw us some work.

14:42.391 --> 14:44.025
- Really?
- That's--

14:44.060 --> 14:46.495
Yeah, he's been great.

14:46.529 --> 14:47.963
That's terrific.

14:47.997 --> 14:49.397
I know. It's pretty surreal.

14:49.432 --> 14:51.500
Well, what are you gonna
do with all of your land?

14:51.534 --> 14:52.734
Well, I know--I mean,

14:52.768 --> 14:53.902
Obviously I'm gonna build a house on it.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.337
With your own hands?

14:55.371 --> 14:57.506
Yes, with my own hands.
I mean, for sure, of course.

14:58.875 --> 15:00.876
Maybe after I get some
more funds together,

15:00.910 --> 15:02.077
But all in due time.

15:02.111 --> 15:04.079
Maybe garrity motors
will send more your way.

15:04.113 --> 15:05.514
Becky.

15:05.548 --> 15:07.849
Um, that'd be fantastic.

15:07.884 --> 15:10.552
Also gonna enroll in
this tech school here.

15:10.586 --> 15:11.853
You know, just for riggins' rigs

15:11.888 --> 15:13.622
To keep up the pace with everyone else.

15:13.656 --> 15:15.257
I mean, it's kind of a no-brainer,

15:15.291 --> 15:17.392
So I'll be here a bit longer.

15:17.426 --> 15:19.528
Then we win, 'cause we get to have you

15:19.562 --> 15:20.996
In our backyard a little bit longer.

15:21.030 --> 15:22.864
All right.

15:47.089 --> 15:48.156
Good night, honey. I love you.

15:48.191 --> 15:49.691
I love you too.

15:49.725 --> 15:51.293
Don't forget to say your prayers, okay?

15:51.327 --> 15:52.494
Yes, ma'am.

15:52.528 --> 15:53.495
All right.

15:53.529 --> 15:55.163
Good night.

15:59.235 --> 16:02.604
Dear lord, please let me get
some more drugs before Friday.

16:10.379 --> 16:12.647
- Hey.
- Hey, hon'.

16:12.682 --> 16:15.684
Yeah, um, I was gonna go watch tv,

16:15.718 --> 16:17.719
But dad's in there.

16:27.797 --> 16:30.198
So are you gonna tell
me what's going on?

16:32.868 --> 16:35.904
Well, apparently there's
somebody at the school

16:35.938 --> 16:37.672
Who's trying to get me fired.

16:37.707 --> 16:40.709
I gave counsel to a girl in need

16:40.743 --> 16:43.211
And it's got some people upset.

16:43.246 --> 16:45.880
So can they really fire you?

16:50.486 --> 16:51.519
Don't you worry.

16:51.554 --> 16:55.357
It's gonna be okay.

16:55.391 --> 16:57.392
Okay.

17:03.966 --> 17:05.733
Hey.

17:05.768 --> 17:08.336
- Hey.
- What's up?

17:08.371 --> 17:10.305
Can I come in?

17:10.339 --> 17:12.473
- Yeah, of course you can.
- Yeah?

17:12.508 --> 17:15.844
Come on in.

17:15.877 --> 17:18.813
Welcome to the humble--

17:20.715 --> 17:22.250
Uh, che--

17:22.285 --> 17:25.086
Hey, um, I don't--

17:25.121 --> 17:27.021
I know I said I wasn't gonna
be knocking on your door

17:27.056 --> 17:28.990
In the middle of the night,

17:29.025 --> 17:31.359
But, um, that was a pretty great dinner.

17:31.394 --> 17:32.727
This isn't a good idea.

17:32.762 --> 17:33.995
I can't do this.

17:34.030 --> 17:35.797
I'm sorry.

17:35.831 --> 17:37.666
It's not just about sex.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.034
I know we've done that.

17:39.068 --> 17:43.471
And I just feel like we
should get to know each other.

17:43.506 --> 17:45.006
I mean, I'm a pretty great girl

17:45.041 --> 17:46.675
And you're a pretty great guy

17:46.709 --> 17:48.877
And we barely know each other

17:48.911 --> 17:51.546
And we're living just a few meters away

17:51.580 --> 17:53.515
And I think it would be a shame

17:53.549 --> 17:56.451
If we didn't, like,
date or, I don't know,

17:56.485 --> 17:58.286
Hang out like normal people.

17:58.321 --> 17:59.821
- Cheryl, listen to me.
- What?

17:59.855 --> 18:02.324
Just listen for one second.

18:02.358 --> 18:05.193
I think you're a great person
and I will never forget

18:05.227 --> 18:07.529
What you've done to
help me with the trailer

18:07.563 --> 18:12.067
And I respect you enormously
and becky as well, but just--

18:12.101 --> 18:13.601
I respect you too.

18:13.636 --> 18:16.271
I'm not the right guy for you

18:16.305 --> 18:18.440
And you need to believe
me when I say that.

18:18.474 --> 18:20.909
I'm not ready to have
or be in a relationship

18:20.943 --> 18:23.111
With someone that already
has a family and I just--

18:23.145 --> 18:25.380
Doesn't have to be a relationship.

18:25.414 --> 18:27.215
I mean, you don't have to worry about--

18:27.249 --> 18:29.384
I'm sorry. This isn't gonna happen.

18:33.022 --> 18:35.223
All right.

18:35.257 --> 18:37.892
Well, I just--

18:37.927 --> 18:39.361
You know, I thought it
would be kind of silly

18:39.395 --> 18:41.363
If I never said anything, you know?

18:41.397 --> 18:44.632
So just in case.

18:44.667 --> 18:46.401
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be, please.

18:46.435 --> 18:47.402
I don't-- I'm drunk.

18:49.805 --> 18:52.073
Um, thanks for dinner, by the way.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.689
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hi.

19:07.723 --> 19:08.690
It's good.

19:08.724 --> 19:10.158
How's your mom?

19:10.192 --> 19:11.860
How's my mom?

19:11.894 --> 19:13.828
Oh, um, she came by my
house the other day,

19:13.863 --> 19:17.332
You know, to talk about
everything that was going on,

19:17.366 --> 19:20.969
So I think she just kind of left upset.

19:21.003 --> 19:23.304
Um, she shouldn't have done that.

19:23.339 --> 19:24.339
- I'm so sorry.
- No, luke.

19:24.373 --> 19:25.407
It's really okay.

19:25.441 --> 19:26.674
We had a good talk.

19:26.709 --> 19:29.043
No, I'm sorry, okay?

19:29.078 --> 19:31.846
That won't ever happen again, okay?

19:31.881 --> 19:32.981
Um, okay.

19:33.015 --> 19:34.382
Sorry.

19:36.619 --> 19:39.821
You should have advised
her to seek counseling.

19:39.855 --> 19:41.623
Well, she came to me for counsel

19:41.657 --> 19:43.358
And I gave her her options.

19:43.392 --> 19:45.927
And you felt it appropriate
to take on that role?

19:45.961 --> 19:49.197
Miss jackson,
do you know what my role is?

19:49.231 --> 19:51.599
I am a certified
counselor and principal.

19:51.634 --> 19:54.369
I followed protocol according
to district policy.

19:54.403 --> 19:56.538
And you found it appropriate
to impose your values

19:56.572 --> 19:59.474
On an innocent, 16-year-old,
confused girl?

19:59.508 --> 20:01.209
No, ma'am. I did not impose my values.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.611
You referred her to an abortion clinic.

20:03.646 --> 20:06.181
I did not refer her
to an abortion clinic.

20:06.215 --> 20:07.849
She went to the clinic with her mother.

20:07.883 --> 20:10.285
You provided this girl
who was not your student,

20:10.319 --> 20:12.754
Who is not zoned in your
school with the information

20:12.788 --> 20:14.289
To get her child aborted.

20:14.323 --> 20:15.623
I did not, ma'am.

20:15.658 --> 20:17.058
Are you calling me a liar?

20:17.092 --> 20:18.560
No, I'm telling you you
have bad information.

20:18.594 --> 20:21.129
Okay, let's please just calm down.

20:21.163 --> 20:23.331
Now we're here because
a parent complained

20:23.365 --> 20:24.899
That an educator from our district

20:24.934 --> 20:26.935
Inappropriately advised a girl.

20:26.969 --> 20:28.503
That is all this is about.

20:28.537 --> 20:29.804
I agree, tom.

20:29.839 --> 20:31.039
Fine.

20:31.073 --> 20:33.842
Mrs. Taylor, did you or did you not

20:33.876 --> 20:36.377
Advise this girl to get an abortion?

20:36.412 --> 20:38.813
I did not advise her
to get an abortion, no.

20:38.848 --> 20:41.049
Is girl came to me. She was scared.

20:41.083 --> 20:43.918
She was desperate for an
adult to listen to her.

20:43.953 --> 20:46.154
I gave her options and I listened.

20:46.188 --> 20:47.355
That was my responsibility to her

20:47.389 --> 20:50.458
As a principal and as a human being.

20:50.493 --> 20:51.826
I hope you all will
keep that in mind today

20:51.861 --> 20:53.094
As you make your decision.

20:53.128 --> 20:54.229
Thank you.

20:54.263 --> 20:56.264
I know you'll let me know.

21:07.009 --> 21:08.776
They just say things sometimes.

21:08.811 --> 21:10.044
I mean, I don't know though.

21:10.079 --> 21:12.247
- Obama though? Really?
- Yeah.

21:12.281 --> 21:14.148
She turned a little red
when she talked about him.

21:15.518 --> 21:18.686
I had a good time last night.

21:18.721 --> 21:20.088
Me too.

21:20.122 --> 21:22.457
I sure didn't see you coming.

21:22.491 --> 21:23.791
I know.

21:23.826 --> 21:24.859
That's why you hit me with this car.

21:24.894 --> 21:26.528
That's not what I meant.

21:26.562 --> 21:28.663
I know what you meant.

21:28.697 --> 21:31.132
I didn't see you coming either.

21:45.581 --> 21:47.315
You need to take a nap, sweet girl.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.250
You need to. You're exhausted.

21:49.285 --> 21:50.451
Hello?

21:50.486 --> 21:53.121
Five to one in your favor.

21:53.155 --> 21:55.790
Really, paul?

21:55.824 --> 21:57.392
Yeah.

21:57.426 --> 21:58.560
Well, thank you.

21:58.594 --> 22:00.094
You're welcome.

22:00.129 --> 22:01.496
It's over.

22:01.530 --> 22:03.665
I just don't want this to
get outside of the board.

22:03.699 --> 22:06.200
This is the kind of
thing that, you know,

22:06.235 --> 22:09.237
Some parents could go nuts about
if they hear it out of context.

22:09.271 --> 22:11.205
I have no reason to
think this could happen.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.107
Just be careful.

22:13.142 --> 22:15.410
I want to protect you
as much as possible.

22:15.444 --> 22:17.045
Well, I appreciate you, paul.

22:17.079 --> 22:18.513
You're welcome.

22:18.547 --> 22:21.416
- Thank you. Bye
-bye.

22:32.027 --> 22:33.361
So I'ma need you Friday night.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.930
You know I play football Friday nights.

22:35.965 --> 22:37.565
Well, let me just call
this son-of-a-bitch

22:37.600 --> 22:39.601
And tell him you got a game.

22:45.074 --> 22:46.841
Okay, I'll be there.

22:46.875 --> 22:48.876
I'll get you after your game.

22:48.911 --> 22:50.912
Just be ready.

22:53.315 --> 22:56.584
I don't know why you bother
even talking to that guy.

22:56.619 --> 23:00.121
I'm just doing some extra
work for him at the shop.

23:00.155 --> 23:02.724
Help pay for your mom?

23:07.663 --> 23:12.233
She okay?

23:12.267 --> 23:17.472
I don't know.

23:17.506 --> 23:21.075
The school board votes and that's it?

23:21.110 --> 23:23.778
Well, not if I have
anything to say about it.

23:23.812 --> 23:25.713
Who was that? Who you talking to?

23:25.748 --> 23:27.749
I just got off the phone
with the school board.

23:27.783 --> 23:29.717
Mom, this needs to stop, okay?

23:29.752 --> 23:32.086
You should not have gone
over to talk to becky.

23:32.121 --> 23:34.055
I wish--will you please
just let this go?

23:34.089 --> 23:37.125
A woman who would do something like that

23:37.159 --> 23:38.960
Should not be in charge of children.

23:38.994 --> 23:41.162
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

23:41.196 --> 23:42.964
Principal taylor,
she didn't do anything here, mom.

23:42.998 --> 23:46.000
I'm the one who got becky pregnant,

23:46.035 --> 23:48.403
So why are you blaming coach's wife?

23:48.437 --> 23:49.604
Oh, coach taylor.

23:49.638 --> 23:51.773
Football! Is that all you care about?

23:51.807 --> 23:52.974
No.

23:53.008 --> 23:55.710
That was your child.

23:55.744 --> 24:00.848
That was my grandchild.

24:00.883 --> 24:03.985
Mom, I'm sorry, okay?

24:04.019 --> 24:07.588
But principal taylor
didn't do anything wrong

24:07.623 --> 24:09.424
And it's not gonna help by you trying

24:09.458 --> 24:10.758
To take her down for this.

24:10.793 --> 24:13.027
But she cannot do something like that.

24:13.062 --> 24:14.429
Okay. Okay.

24:14.463 --> 24:16.030
Luke! Luke!

24:16.065 --> 24:17.665
Do not walk out on me, luke!

24:26.374 --> 24:28.575
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:34.399 --> 24:35.966
Oh, I'm tired.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.068
I got some good news today.

24:38.069 --> 24:39.269
What's that?

24:39.303 --> 24:42.472
The board decided to
keep me as principal.

24:42.507 --> 24:44.041
Woo-hoo.

24:44.075 --> 24:46.810
How you feel about that?

24:46.844 --> 24:49.680
I feel kind of heartbroken
that it happened,

24:49.714 --> 24:52.082
But I guess I'm glad to have my job.

25:01.459 --> 25:02.893
What you doing tonight?

25:02.927 --> 25:04.895
Nothing.

25:04.929 --> 25:05.996
I'll go get the wine.

25:06.030 --> 25:08.031
Okay.

25:11.803 --> 25:19.776
* *

25:27.351 --> 25:29.419
Do you know where I can
get some oxycontin?

25:29.454 --> 25:31.922
I don't know what you
talking about, man.

25:31.956 --> 25:33.023
Dude, I'm not a narc.

25:33.057 --> 25:34.424
I just really need some painkillers.

25:34.459 --> 25:36.526
I got money, dude.

25:36.561 --> 25:37.961
Look, I don't care who you is.

25:37.995 --> 25:39.062
Raise up out my park, man.

25:39.097 --> 25:40.464
All right.

25:40.498 --> 25:42.265
Okay, thanks.

25:50.174 --> 25:51.808
Do you know where I can
get some oxycontin?

25:51.843 --> 25:53.310
Dallas, come on. I'm hungry.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.178
Let's get something to eat.
Come on. Let's go.

25:55.213 --> 25:59.716
All right, little brother. Let's roll.

26:00.918 --> 26:02.586
Hey, eric.

26:02.620 --> 26:03.720
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

26:03.755 --> 26:04.755
Good.

26:04.789 --> 26:05.922
What you doing out here?

26:05.957 --> 26:08.925
You notice anything different about me?

26:08.960 --> 26:11.027
You got a new belt.

26:11.062 --> 26:12.529
No.

26:12.563 --> 26:15.365
Took the ring off.

26:15.399 --> 26:17.067
Panther ring.

26:17.101 --> 26:18.168
48 hours.

26:18.202 --> 26:20.637
I just wanted to see
if I could stand it.

26:20.671 --> 26:21.838
You know what?

26:21.873 --> 26:23.473
I can stand it.

26:23.508 --> 26:25.675
And I love the old panthers.

26:25.710 --> 26:27.144
I don't love the new panthers.

26:27.178 --> 26:30.881
But I cannot wait for that game.

26:30.915 --> 26:32.482
It's gonna be a good one.

26:32.517 --> 26:36.153
What do you think our real chances are?

26:36.187 --> 26:38.755
I've got a kickoff in four hours.

26:38.790 --> 26:41.124
I don't have time to talk
about this right now.

26:41.159 --> 26:42.559
You gon' be at the game tonight?

26:42.593 --> 26:43.827
Yeah.

26:43.861 --> 26:45.195
I'll see you then.

26:45.229 --> 26:47.397
Good game, coach.

26:52.570 --> 26:54.004
Hey, lady. Can I come in?

26:54.038 --> 26:55.372
Hey, jess.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.407
Hey.

26:57.441 --> 26:58.942
How you doing?

26:58.976 --> 27:01.511
I'm good. How you doing?

27:01.546 --> 27:04.948
Just, uh--vince told me you were here,

27:04.982 --> 27:07.050
So, uh, I didn't know

27:07.084 --> 27:09.252
If it was okay to come or not,

27:09.287 --> 27:12.522
But I just wanted to say hi.

27:12.557 --> 27:15.792
And I wanted to tell you
vince is really proud

27:15.827 --> 27:19.596
Of what you're doing and everything.

27:19.630 --> 27:24.034
Thank you.

27:24.068 --> 27:26.036
He's a good boy, isn't he?

27:26.070 --> 27:27.771
He is.

27:31.876 --> 27:32.843
It's okay.

27:32.877 --> 27:35.045
It's okay.

27:35.079 --> 27:37.214
Thank you for coming.

27:40.685 --> 27:42.619
- Let's go, boy.
- Yeah, yeah!

27:42.653 --> 27:44.154
We about to lay somebody on they back!

27:45.356 --> 27:47.357
And it's two kinds of .

28:07.578 --> 28:09.045
What do you want, matt?

28:09.080 --> 28:12.215
Julie?

28:12.250 --> 28:13.650
Hello? Are you there?

28:13.684 --> 28:15.518
Don't hang up, please?

28:15.553 --> 28:18.588
Julie, did you hang up?

28:18.623 --> 28:20.190
No, I didn't.

28:20.224 --> 28:22.192
Look, I know you're mad, all right?

28:22.226 --> 28:24.427
I'd be mad too, you know?

28:24.462 --> 28:27.397
I'd be furious if that had happened.

28:27.431 --> 28:29.599
Great. Can I go now?

28:29.634 --> 28:30.901
No.

28:30.935 --> 28:32.068
I just wanted to tell you that, um,

28:32.103 --> 28:33.670
I'm in chicago.

28:33.704 --> 28:35.205
I know.

28:35.239 --> 28:38.074
I talked to your mom and your grandma.

28:38.109 --> 28:39.976
I just got a job at this art gallery.

28:40.011 --> 28:41.411
I mean, it's just entry-level stuff,

28:41.445 --> 28:43.713
But I don't know, it's pretty exciting.

28:43.748 --> 28:45.849
I'm gonna start school next semester.

28:45.883 --> 28:48.652
And I got an apartment.

28:48.686 --> 28:49.953
That's great.

28:49.987 --> 28:51.955
Sounds like you got it all worked out.

28:51.989 --> 28:53.823
But not--I don't know. It's just weird,

28:53.858 --> 28:55.091
'cause, like,
I got everything worked out.

28:55.126 --> 28:57.360
It doesn't-- I n't know.

28:57.395 --> 29:00.530
It just doesn't feel right,
you know, 'cause--

29:00.564 --> 29:04.701
'cause you're not here.

29:04.735 --> 29:07.737
Well, I'm glad I mean something to you.

29:07.772 --> 29:12.242
Just not enough to call me until now.

29:12.276 --> 29:14.244
Julie, look, I'm sorry, all right?

29:14.278 --> 29:16.713
I just--I was really upset and--

29:16.747 --> 29:18.748
And how do you think that I felt?

29:18.783 --> 29:21.217
No, you're right. It's--

29:21.252 --> 29:23.386
You know, with everything
that I was going through, I--

29:23.421 --> 29:25.855
Matt, we were together
for almost four years.

29:25.890 --> 29:31.294
I know everything about you.

29:31.329 --> 29:33.363
You were my other half.

29:33.397 --> 29:36.266
I hate you so much for leaving me.

29:39.971 --> 29:43.473
How could you do that to
somebody that you love?

29:43.507 --> 29:44.641
I don't know.

29:44.675 --> 29:46.576
I just thought--

29:46.610 --> 29:48.378
Just felt like that
was what I had to do.

29:48.412 --> 29:50.747
Well, I have to do what I have to do.

29:50.781 --> 29:54.985
And whatever's missing in your life...

29:55.019 --> 29:56.720
I suggest you go out and find it.

29:56.754 --> 29:59.622
No, julie, don't say that, all right?

29:59.657 --> 30:01.891
Bye, matt.

30:17.942 --> 30:21.478
You understand 1 tight end,
11 personnel.

30:21.512 --> 30:22.579
Everything is off me.

30:22.613 --> 30:23.847
We'll start signaling the plays

30:23.881 --> 30:25.715
So they'll think that
we're going no-huddle.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.851
All right, just go on through the step.

30:27.885 --> 30:29.019
Keep that tight end on your side

30:29.053 --> 30:33.623
And tighten your splits down, all right?

30:33.657 --> 30:35.058
What's up, tinker?

30:35.092 --> 30:36.359
What's going on, man?

30:36.394 --> 30:40.630
Uh, I saw you at carroll
park last night.

30:40.664 --> 30:42.165
Yeah.

30:42.199 --> 30:43.633
I was just nervous about something.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.668
Couldn't sleep, so I took a drive

30:45.703 --> 30:47.303
And didn't feel any better.

30:47.338 --> 30:48.772
Took a walk.

30:48.806 --> 30:53.410
What I heard was you
brought some cash with you.

30:53.444 --> 30:54.878
What's going on, man?

30:54.912 --> 30:58.982
First five games you talking
like an announcer in the huddle.

30:59.016 --> 31:00.650
Last three weeks it seems like you been

31:00.684 --> 31:02.052
Saving your breath for something.

31:02.086 --> 31:04.921
Something wrong?

31:04.955 --> 31:05.989
What's going on?

31:06.023 --> 31:07.490
Be real with me.

31:07.525 --> 31:09.793
All right.

31:14.565 --> 31:15.565
All right?

31:15.599 --> 31:17.200
What is that?

31:17.234 --> 31:19.335
- It's a bruise.
- Why you didn't say nothing?

31:19.370 --> 31:20.770
Because I can play through it,
all right?

31:20.805 --> 31:22.005
Why you didn't tell no one?

31:22.039 --> 31:23.773
Hey, not a word, tinker.

31:23.808 --> 31:24.841
You should have said something.

31:24.875 --> 31:25.975
You should have told me.

31:26.010 --> 31:27.744
All right. All right.

31:30.881 --> 31:33.216
- -
- here we go, folks.

31:33.250 --> 31:34.784
Five minutes left in the second quarter

31:34.819 --> 31:37.053
And the lions will try
to claw their way back

31:37.088 --> 31:39.289
From a seven-nothing deficit.

31:39.323 --> 31:40.523
All right, look.

31:40.558 --> 31:41.925
All right, we going 27
option left, all right?

31:41.959 --> 31:43.460
On one, ready? All: Break.

31:43.494 --> 31:45.562
Howard brings them up to the line.

31:45.596 --> 31:46.763
Get set!

31:46.797 --> 31:48.064
Under center. There's the snap.

31:48.099 --> 31:49.632
It's an option.
Oh, it's a pitch to cafferty

31:49.667 --> 31:51.968
To the outside.

31:52.002 --> 31:53.536
Oh, look at him go, folks.

31:53.571 --> 31:54.871
Cut to the outside.

31:54.905 --> 31:56.873
He's got room and he
steps out of bounds.

31:56.907 --> 31:59.075
What are you running out of bounds for?

31:59.110 --> 32:01.544
Hey, what are you running
out of bounds for?

32:01.579 --> 32:03.480
Hey, get upfield! Let's go!

32:03.514 --> 32:04.981
Same play, coach.

32:05.015 --> 32:06.449
Same thing, right? Same thing.

32:06.484 --> 32:07.484
Here! Here we go!

32:07.518 --> 32:09.786
Vince.

32:09.820 --> 32:11.488
Let's go! Let's go!

32:11.522 --> 32:12.622
We cannot run that play again.

32:12.656 --> 32:13.623
Excuse me?

32:13.657 --> 32:15.091
We cannot run to that side.

32:15.126 --> 32:16.392
Do you have a reason why not?

32:16.427 --> 32:18.094
Dude, luke it hurt.
His right side is messed up.

32:18.129 --> 32:20.263
Every time we run that play,
he gets hit in his right side.

32:20.297 --> 32:21.498
All right, so you want us to do exactly

32:21.532 --> 32:22.732
What the coach doesn't want us to do.

32:22.766 --> 32:24.434
- Okay, great.
- Luke, how bad is it, man?

32:24.468 --> 32:26.102
Can you make it through this one?

32:26.137 --> 32:28.505
I mean, it depends on which way we run.

32:28.539 --> 32:30.573
- I mean--
- you've heard the man.

32:30.608 --> 32:32.375
All right, we going 28 option right.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.511
28 option right. You got it?

32:34.545 --> 32:35.812
On one. Ready? All: Break!

32:35.846 --> 32:37.113
Let's go.

32:41.585 --> 32:43.086
Quick toss to the right.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.654
Cafferty cuts it inside.

32:44.688 --> 32:45.855
What's he doing?

32:45.890 --> 32:47.090
Look at him go, folks.
Another great cut.

32:47.124 --> 32:48.791
Trucks the linebacker.

32:48.826 --> 32:50.326
Boom! Another big hit

32:50.361 --> 32:52.028
And down goes cafferty.

32:52.062 --> 32:53.096
First down lions.

32:57.868 --> 32:58.868
What'd you give him?

32:58.903 --> 33:00.203
We called left!

33:00.237 --> 33:01.371
Hey, vince!

33:01.405 --> 33:02.972
Come here!

33:03.007 --> 33:04.807
Did I tell you to run a
sweep to the short side?

33:04.842 --> 33:06.276
- No, sir.
- What'd you just run?

33:06.310 --> 33:07.377
I ran it to the short side.

33:07.411 --> 33:08.545
Why did you do that?

33:08.579 --> 33:09.913
'cause I got the signals mixed up.

33:09.947 --> 33:11.548
- I couldn't really see.
- You got mixed up?

33:11.582 --> 33:12.682
Come on, son.

33:12.716 --> 33:13.917
We've got them by the ass right now.

33:13.951 --> 33:15.151
Be smart. Let's go.

33:15.186 --> 33:16.186
- Here we go.
- Let's go, baby.

33:16.220 --> 33:18.454
- Let's go.
- All right.

33:18.489 --> 33:19.856
He mixed up left and right?

33:19.890 --> 33:21.057
He mixed up.

33:21.091 --> 33:22.358
We didn't talk about that in practice.

33:22.393 --> 33:24.627
We'll have to review that, I suppose.

33:24.662 --> 33:25.995
Luke, I'm sorry.

33:26.030 --> 33:28.131
We're going 27 option left.

33:28.165 --> 33:30.033
27 option left on one.

33:30.067 --> 33:31.901
Ready? All: Break!

33:31.936 --> 33:34.103
- Beautiful option.
- There you go, baby!

33:34.138 --> 33:35.405
Cafferty to the left side.

33:35.439 --> 33:36.573
Oh, but he gets barreled by two linemen!

33:36.607 --> 33:38.174
Let's go, luke! Suck it up!

33:38.209 --> 33:39.442
Suck it up!

33:39.476 --> 33:41.110
Cafferty is slow to get up, folks.

33:41.145 --> 33:43.179
My, he took a big hit right there.

33:43.214 --> 33:44.280
Let's go! Walk it off!

33:44.315 --> 33:45.348
- Let's go!
- Finish that!

33:45.382 --> 33:48.117
Let's go!

33:48.152 --> 33:49.452
- Same play.
- Same play?

33:49.486 --> 33:51.487
It's the same thing. We're coming left.

33:53.524 --> 33:54.757
Lines on the center.

33:54.792 --> 33:56.292
Cafferty goes in motion.

33:56.327 --> 33:58.628
Oh, there's another
pitch to the left side.

33:58.662 --> 33:59.862
Looking upfield.

33:59.897 --> 34:01.831
It looks like cafferty's
hearing footsteps.

34:01.865 --> 34:04.067
Oh, and he gets pasted!

34:04.101 --> 34:05.535
Down he goes.

34:05.569 --> 34:08.004
Oh, my. He looks hurt, folks.

34:11.041 --> 34:12.275
- He's hurt.
- Hey, time-out.

34:12.309 --> 34:13.810
Time-out. Time-out.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.945
- And coach has to call a time
-out.

34:19.315 --> 34:20.583
- You got it?
- Can you get up?

34:20.618 --> 34:21.717
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

34:21.752 --> 34:23.152
Let's go. Yep, let's go.

34:23.187 --> 34:25.955
Cafferty's up, but he
is moving very gingerly.

34:25.989 --> 34:27.724
The crowd on their feet
giving this young man

34:27.757 --> 34:29.324
A little round of applause.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.128
Playing like a young lion tonight,

34:32.161 --> 34:34.864
But, man, he is taking a beating.

34:37.935 --> 34:39.534
it's my hip.

34:39.570 --> 34:42.972
Let me see.

34:43.007 --> 34:44.641
You all right?

34:44.675 --> 34:46.141
What the hell is that?

34:46.176 --> 34:47.877
It's a hip flexor. He's done.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.512
He's out for the season.

34:49.545 --> 34:50.980
How long you had that?

34:51.014 --> 34:52.382
Four weeks.

34:52.416 --> 34:54.984
Four weeks! You didn't tell anyone?

34:55.018 --> 34:57.687
You did that four weeks ago
and you didn't tell us?

34:57.721 --> 35:02.358
I thought I could play
through it, coach.

35:02.393 --> 35:03.726
I'm sorry, coach.

35:03.761 --> 35:05.762
I'm sorry, coach!

35:15.572 --> 35:17.173
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:17.207 --> 35:18.541
i>- About to watch thelma & louise.

35:18.575 --> 35:21.744
You want to join me?

35:21.779 --> 35:23.379
I made popcorn.

35:23.414 --> 35:24.881
Where's your mom?

35:24.915 --> 35:29.452
She has to work until 2:00.

35:29.486 --> 35:32.422
Yeah, I don't think
it's a good idea, becks.

35:32.456 --> 35:33.723
Why not?

35:33.757 --> 35:35.658
Just isn't.

35:35.693 --> 35:37.093
Please?

35:37.127 --> 35:39.195
I don't want to be alone.

35:55.112 --> 35:57.146
What other movies you got?

35:59.450 --> 36:01.584
Look, we'll just go in there,
get my money,

36:01.618 --> 36:03.152
And we get out.

36:03.187 --> 36:04.587
So it might get a little hot in there,

36:04.621 --> 36:06.289
So I'ma need you to stay in
here and keep the car running

36:06.323 --> 36:08.424
Since you like to watch anyway.

36:08.459 --> 36:10.326
Come on, calvin.
I'ma need a little muscle.

36:10.361 --> 36:11.828
Let's roll.

36:11.862 --> 36:13.496
Yo, b, we'll be right back.

36:13.530 --> 36:15.064
Keep this thing running, all right?

36:15.099 --> 36:17.100
I got you.

36:41.625 --> 36:43.626
I think I'm moving out.

36:56.607 --> 36:58.074
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

36:58.108 --> 36:59.175
I do not believe this.

36:59.209 --> 37:00.510
Cheryl, it's not what you think.

37:00.544 --> 37:01.644
Oh, my god.

37:01.678 --> 37:02.678
It's exactly what I think it is.

37:02.713 --> 37:03.746
Get out of here.

37:04.948 --> 37:06.849
On my bed with my daughter

37:06.884 --> 37:08.084
In the middle of the night
and it's not what I think?

37:08.118 --> 37:09.152
Mom--

37:09.186 --> 37:10.386
How long has this been going on?

37:10.421 --> 37:11.421
Thank god I came home sick.

37:11.455 --> 37:12.955
Mom, we were just watching a movie.

37:12.990 --> 37:14.090
You get out of here.

37:14.124 --> 37:15.291
You get out!

37:15.325 --> 37:17.360
Get your stuff off my
property right now!

37:17.394 --> 37:18.594
You go to your room, becky!

37:18.629 --> 37:19.662
- Mom--
- no!

37:19.696 --> 37:20.696
You stop it!

37:20.731 --> 37:23.366
Shut up and go to your room right now!

37:23.400 --> 37:24.700
Go in your room!

37:24.735 --> 37:27.537
In my bed! Are you kidding me?

37:27.571 --> 37:29.839
You must think I'm some
sort of an idiot, tim,

37:29.873 --> 37:32.141
While I go banging on your trailer door

37:32.176 --> 37:33.443
In the middle of the night

37:33.477 --> 37:35.111
When you were sleeping with my daughter

37:35.145 --> 37:37.447
Under my nose.

37:37.481 --> 37:39.415
You're exactly what I thought you were

37:39.450 --> 37:40.550
When I first met you.

37:40.584 --> 37:42.051
You're nothing.

37:42.085 --> 37:43.252
You're just like all the other guys

37:43.287 --> 37:44.921
I've ever met in my life.

37:44.955 --> 37:47.089
Absolutely nothing.

37:47.124 --> 37:48.624
I can't believe this!

37:48.659 --> 37:51.894
I cannot believe this has
been going on this whole time!

37:51.929 --> 37:53.296
I never touched your daughter.

37:53.330 --> 37:55.131
You can buy your land...

37:55.165 --> 37:57.467
And you can do whatever you do,

37:57.501 --> 38:01.971
But you will never
amount to anything ever!

38:02.005 --> 38:03.339
Go!

38:03.373 --> 38:05.708
I don't ever want to see you again!

38:13.417 --> 38:15.318
Go!

38:22.826 --> 38:24.060
Get out of here!

38:24.094 --> 38:25.795
You gon' get our asses shot!

38:25.829 --> 38:26.829
Get out of here!

38:26.864 --> 38:28.197
Go! Go!

38:43.313 --> 38:44.480
Hello?

38:44.515 --> 38:46.115
Hi. This principal taylor?

38:46.149 --> 38:48.017
Yes, it is.

38:48.051 --> 38:50.820
i>- Hi, I'm charles bunn
from the dillon gazette

38:50.854 --> 38:53.289
And I'm wondering if you
would like to comment

38:53.323 --> 38:55.291
About the allegations brought up on you

38:55.325 --> 38:58.728
About how you advised a
student to get an abortion.

39:01.598 --> 39:03.332
No.

39:03.367 --> 39:04.901
No comment.

39:22.853 --> 39:23.853
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:23.887 --> 39:25.454
What are you doing here?

39:25.489 --> 39:27.657
I was just-- I need to talk to you.

39:27.691 --> 39:29.792
Your mom's gonna kill me.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.694
It's fine, she passed out.

39:31.728 --> 39:34.163
Look, I know you're moving out.

39:34.197 --> 39:35.698
Right.

39:35.732 --> 39:38.167
And I know I'm not gonna
be seeing you much anymore.

39:38.201 --> 39:40.202
So I just wanted to tell you

39:40.237 --> 39:41.804
That the stuff that my mom said to you,

39:41.838 --> 39:43.806
It's not true.

39:46.276 --> 39:48.144
You're not a loser.

39:48.178 --> 39:50.947
And you're not nothing.

39:50.981 --> 39:54.750
You're kind, and you're good,

39:54.785 --> 39:56.185
And you're strong.

39:56.219 --> 40:00.056
You protected me from my dad.

40:00.090 --> 40:04.193
And you drove three hours all
the way to that crappy pageant.

40:05.963 --> 40:07.597
I mean, you didn't even know me then.

40:10.067 --> 40:12.835
And you helped me through
the hardest thing

40:12.869 --> 40:14.670
I have ever had to go through.

40:18.208 --> 40:20.676
And you were the only one there.

40:22.713 --> 40:25.047
So I just wanted to thank you.

40:27.184 --> 40:28.884
For that.

40:43.467 --> 40:45.935
Bye, tim riggins.

41:05.288 --> 41:08.424
I just can't believe we lost.

41:08.458 --> 41:10.493
This season's over.

41:10.527 --> 41:12.561
Luke's out. We're done.

41:12.596 --> 41:14.730
You did your best.

41:18.669 --> 41:20.603
We gotta go, it's late.

41:20.637 --> 41:23.773
Tami taylor's gonna kill me
for keeping you out this late.

41:23.807 --> 41:25.307
Come on.

41:25.342 --> 41:27.410
Sit down, let's have another drink.

41:30.947 --> 41:32.515
I don't wanna go home yet.

42:00.010 --> 42:01.944
- All right.
- Call us later.

42:01.978 --> 42:03.779
- Thanks for the ride.
- Bye, girl.

42:12.656 --> 42:15.357
Yeah, vince, what you doing here?

42:23.366 --> 42:26.402
