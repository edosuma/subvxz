her uncle.

what she went through,

she might need
some help.

what I went through,

I might be in a position
to do that.

11:10.610 --> 11:11.945
One time I found

11:11.978 --> 11:14.514
nine clay pigs.

11:14.548 --> 11:18.217
Only thing they don't
throw out is alcohol.

11:18.251 --> 11:20.086
Why would James
kill Len?

11:20.119 --> 11:22.188
We talked
to their neighbors.

11:22.221 --> 11:25.959
They said James and Len
seemed happy together.

11:25.992 --> 11:27.661
But I can tell you this.

11:27.694 --> 11:31.064
What seems isn't always
what is...

11:31.097 --> 11:32.866
Especially
with rich people.

11:32.899 --> 11:34.568
Reese:
Can you prove
any of this?

11:34.601 --> 11:37.837
Did anyone ever see you
dumpster dive?

11:37.871 --> 11:40.039
That security guard
run me off a few times.

11:40.073 --> 11:43.042
Smith. You can go ask him.
I ain't afraid.

11:43.076 --> 11:47.013
Except for the...
Confusion over your pen,

11:47.046 --> 11:50.216
I ain't lied once.

11:51.918 --> 11:52.886
Homeless guy.

11:52.919 --> 11:55.021
No, I never saw a homeless guy
living back there.

11:55.054 --> 11:56.990
You're not
real bright, are you,

11:57.023 --> 11:58.124
Mr. Smith?

11:58.157 --> 11:59.959
About average, I guess.
Why?

11:59.993 --> 12:01.628
Is there a reason
you ignored the alarm?

12:01.661 --> 12:03.162
And the call from the neighbor
about a scream?

12:03.196 --> 12:05.865
I didn't like going
by the Sand place.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.734
It made me kinda sick.

12:07.767 --> 12:09.268
'Cause they're gay?

12:09.302 --> 12:11.104
No, 'cause I'm lazy.

12:11.137 --> 12:13.673
Are we done?

12:16.242 --> 12:18.044
Okay, the guard didn't know

12:18.077 --> 12:19.913
Easley was living
in the backyard.

12:19.946 --> 12:22.048
Meaning he doesn't
back Easley's story.

12:22.081 --> 12:24.117
Maybe the guard's lying.

12:24.150 --> 12:24.984
The coroner found fibers.

12:25.018 --> 12:26.886
It looks like
the shooter wore gloves.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.755
The guard, Smith,
wore gloves that night.

12:28.788 --> 12:32.058
We tested him.
There was no gunshot residue.

12:32.091 --> 12:33.259
Easley says he saw James.
Mm-hmm.

12:33.292 --> 12:37.130
Let's see if James
says he saw Easley.

12:37.163 --> 12:39.132
James:
Yes, this is my jacket,

12:39.165 --> 12:40.366
and these are all our things.

12:40.399 --> 12:42.035
Were these stolen
from your house

12:42.068 --> 12:42.936
the night your husband Len
was killed?

12:42.969 --> 12:45.872
No. We threw these things
away months ago.

12:45.905 --> 12:47.240
Where did you find them?

12:47.273 --> 12:50.977
A concerned citizen
turned them over to us.

12:51.010 --> 12:52.045
With this.

12:56.349 --> 12:58.117
Where's the rest of it?

12:59.252 --> 13:00.654
Sorry?

13:00.687 --> 13:02.722
Well, the rest of the things
that were taken?

13:02.756 --> 13:05.925
It means the world to me
that you found Len's ring,

13:05.959 --> 13:07.794
but you didn't find
anything else.

13:07.827 --> 13:09.028
You seem surprised.

13:09.062 --> 13:10.797
I'm not surprised,

13:10.830 --> 13:12.098
disappointed.

13:12.131 --> 13:12.899
The things that were stolen

13:12.932 --> 13:15.702
were the things
that Len loved best.

13:15.735 --> 13:19.105
A watch,
his mother's candlesticks.

13:19.138 --> 13:23.142
They, uh, they left
all the expensive things.

13:23.176 --> 13:25.912
How would they know
what was most important to Len?

13:25.945 --> 13:28.114
I-I-I don't know.

13:28.147 --> 13:31.751
But whoever did this
knew Len well.

13:31.785 --> 13:34.220
Really well.

13:34.253 --> 13:38.024
So if the neighbors were
near enough to hear a scream...

13:38.057 --> 13:40.093
What else did they hear?

13:41.895 --> 13:43.262
Drew:
Len and James
were a great couple.

13:43.296 --> 13:45.264
They loved
each other so much.

13:45.298 --> 13:47.333
You never heard them
fight?

13:47.366 --> 13:49.068
No, that's why
I called Smith right away

13:49.102 --> 13:50.103
when I heard the scream.

13:50.136 --> 13:52.071
But it took him forever
to get here.

13:52.105 --> 13:53.272
Tell them
about your theory, Drew.

13:53.306 --> 13:55.041
It's not a theory,
Stephanie.

13:55.074 --> 13:56.109
It's not anything.

13:56.142 --> 13:57.243
I just heard Officer Smith

13:57.276 --> 13:59.779
say things...
Terrible things,

13:59.813 --> 14:03.082
homophobic things, particularly
about Len and James.

14:03.116 --> 14:05.351
Drew thinks
that Smith killed Len.

14:05.384 --> 14:06.920
He thinks
it was a hate crime.

14:06.953 --> 14:07.954
I never said that.

14:07.987 --> 14:08.955
Yes, you did, all right?

14:08.988 --> 14:11.324

Well, then don't act
like one.

All rich people are crazy.
It's not just you.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.667

I'll give you my card.

14:25.972 --> 14:28.241
Okay.
Drew says it's the guard.

14:28.274 --> 14:30.176
Easley says it's James.

14:30.209 --> 14:31.477
Yep--they call themselves
neighbors,

very neighborly.

but my husband, Drew?

14:46.926 --> 14:48.461
Killed Len Sand.

my identity won't be revealed.

14:51.130 --> 14:54.033
We'll certainly do all we can

14:54.067 --> 14:55.434
Why do you think your husband
is the person

14:55.468 --> 14:56.502
who killed Len Sand?

14:56.535 --> 14:58.371
Because, sadly,
my husband is...

14:58.404 --> 15:00.907
A homosexual.

15:00.940 --> 15:03.777
He was having an affair
with Len Sand.

15:03.810 --> 15:05.444
I think Len wanted
to call it off,

15:05.478 --> 15:07.046
so Drew killed him.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.815
You saw this?

15:08.848 --> 15:10.149
You saw the murder?

15:10.183 --> 15:12.886
I saw Drew leaving
Len's house that night

15:12.919 --> 15:14.087
after I heard
the scream.

15:14.270 --> 15:16.906
That's why I called
Smith, the security guard,

15:16.940 --> 15:18.641
to tell him
that I heard the scream.

15:18.674 --> 15:21.010
Because I didn't want Drew
to know that I saw him.

15:21.044 --> 15:22.912
You heard what Drew said.

15:22.946 --> 15:25.081
He's trying to frame Smith
for this.

15:25.114 --> 15:26.282
Do you have proof?

15:26.315 --> 15:28.151
I'm his wife.
He hid things from me.

15:28.184 --> 15:31.454
I wouldn't testify
against him anyway.

look, it's--

We don't have
enough evidence

to take to a grand jury
to charge Drew or James.

believes Easley,

we can arrest James.

Thank you.

20:18.390 --> 20:19.991
Can you go back in

20:20.024 --> 20:21.459
Because we're not done.

20:21.493 --> 20:23.295
I'd rather not.

It's kinda rank.

and your partner owned.

20:40.828 --> 20:43.130

that he was living there.

If they do, they'll indict.

22:34.709 --> 22:36.243
If they don't,
then we got nothing else,

30:10.329 --> 30:12.031
You're lying.
I'm not lying this time.

30:12.064 --> 30:12.999
I swear it!

30:13.032 --> 30:14.000
Prove it right now,

30:14.033 --> 30:16.102
or I walk outta here,
you go back to "D" unit

30:16.135 --> 30:17.303
and you die there.

30:17.336 --> 30:19.005
What do you want me
to say?

30:19.038 --> 30:21.040
I'll say
whatever you tell me.

30:24.110 --> 30:26.545
Wait, boss.
Please don't leave me.

30:28.114 --> 30:29.715
I'm not your boss.

30:29.748 --> 30:31.483
I'm not your friend...

30:33.052 --> 30:35.354
And I'm not giving you
any more chances.

30:35.387 --> 30:36.989
You're all out.

30:40.192 --> 30:42.394
Okay, okay.

30:42.428 --> 30:45.397
I can prove
James Mermerha--

30:45.431 --> 30:47.033
I can't say his name.

30:47.066 --> 30:48.300
He's the one who did it.

30:48.334 --> 30:50.002
But we're gonna need
a shovel.

30:52.104 --> 30:53.705
[Reese grunting]
Crews...

30:53.739 --> 30:56.575
I'm telling you,
he's playin' us.

30:56.608 --> 31:00.379
Because there is
nothing under here

31:00.412 --> 31:01.513
that even--
[Thud]

31:03.782 --> 31:05.251
[Thud]

31:10.156 --> 31:11.423
Clay pig.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.227
Okay.

31:16.295 --> 31:17.363
[Grunts]
Ah!

31:17.396 --> 31:20.799
You got that list of things
James said was stolen?

31:20.832 --> 31:22.034
Yeah.

31:23.635 --> 31:24.636
First item.

31:24.670 --> 31:26.772
Four folders
of antique coins.

31:26.805 --> 31:28.407
Yep. Got those
in here.

31:28.440 --> 31:30.209
Yeah? How 'bout
sterling silverware?

31:30.242 --> 31:32.244
Yep. Got that too.

31:32.278 --> 31:33.245
Ah, what about letters?

31:33.279 --> 31:34.513
No. No letters.

31:34.546 --> 31:36.482
Love letters.

31:36.515 --> 31:39.485
Signed by...

31:39.518 --> 31:41.553
Drew Borns.

31:42.688 --> 31:44.756
You wanna know
what else is in here?

31:44.790 --> 31:46.492
What?

31:55.334 --> 31:56.368
Yes, I wrote
those letters.

31:56.402 --> 31:58.670
My fingerprints
could well be on

31:58.704 --> 32:00.239
the things
in the bag too.

32:00.272 --> 32:01.640
Len always showed off
those things

32:01.673 --> 32:03.142
when we'd go over
to visit.

32:03.175 --> 32:04.676
You stole the letters,

32:04.710 --> 32:07.279
along with the other things
that Len Sand loved.

32:07.313 --> 32:08.414
Why?

32:08.447 --> 32:09.781
They're all addressed
to "My love."

32:09.815 --> 32:11.550
No name.

32:11.583 --> 32:14.620
Those are letters that I gave
to my wife, Stephanie.

32:15.787 --> 32:17.356
Can you prove that?

32:17.389 --> 32:18.856
No, detective,
I don't keep copies

32:18.857 --> 32:20.292
of love letters to my wife.

32:20.326 --> 32:23.329
I didn't know I needed to.

32:27.397 --> 32:29.667
James and Stephanie
put that stuff there,

32:29.700 --> 32:31.135
hoping we'd find it
and blame Drew.

32:31.168 --> 32:32.637
They didn't count on

32:32.670 --> 32:34.238
Easley taking it
and burying it.

32:34.271 --> 32:35.906
But how do we prove it?

32:35.940 --> 32:37.074
The frame worked.
Drew looks guilty.

32:37.107 --> 32:38.175
We know that.

32:38.208 --> 32:39.877
We know James
and Stephanie know that.

32:39.910 --> 32:41.679
They don't know
we know.

32:41.712 --> 32:42.947
What they do know is
that if we found the bag,

32:42.980 --> 32:44.615
we'd focus on Drew.

32:44.649 --> 32:46.050
So they then know what to say
when we come.

32:46.083 --> 32:48.352
And so?
I'm not hearing a plan.

32:48.385 --> 32:50.020
Well, let's see
if they embrace

32:50.054 --> 32:51.255
not knowing
what they don't know.

32:57.928 --> 32:59.930
No. No, I didn't get it.

32:59.964 --> 33:02.199
Are you sure? Okay.

33:02.232 --> 33:04.101
I'll look for it again.

33:04.134 --> 33:06.170
Can I ask why
you called me down here?

33:06.203 --> 33:07.071
It's not a big thing.

33:07.104 --> 33:09.106
Would--would you just give me
one minute?

33:09.139 --> 33:11.642
This isn't something
we could do over the phone?

33:11.676 --> 33:14.645
Crews:
Maybe I should have 'em
send it down again.

33:14.679 --> 33:16.146
[Drawer opens, closes]
Oh, here it is.

33:29.827 --> 33:31.762
Have a seat, Stephanie.

33:31.796 --> 33:33.698
Do you know how
I got that bag?

33:33.731 --> 33:36.033
Why would I know that?

33:36.066 --> 33:37.868
James gave me that bag.

33:37.902 --> 33:38.803
That's what he's out there

33:38.836 --> 33:40.671
talking to Detective Crews
about right now.

33:42.139 --> 33:44.141
So, James,

33:44.174 --> 33:46.110
your neighbor,
Stephanie Borns,

33:46.143 --> 33:48.345
found the items
that you reported stolen.

33:48.378 --> 33:50.314
She's in there
with my partner

33:50.347 --> 33:51.816
giving her statement.

33:51.849 --> 33:54.018
Whe--um...
When did she find them?

33:54.051 --> 33:55.152
She called this morning.

33:55.185 --> 33:55.886
But don't worry.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.121
Your items
are all being indexed,

33:57.154 --> 33:58.322
and they will be returned
to you--

33:58.355 --> 33:59.857
plus a few you left out.

33:59.890 --> 34:01.926
Left out?

34:01.959 --> 34:03.260
What--what things?

34:03.293 --> 34:04.995
I got the list here.

34:05.029 --> 34:06.130
You don't know
what's in the bag?

34:06.163 --> 34:07.932
No, I told you
I don't know.

34:07.965 --> 34:11.168
Hmm. 'Cause James
said you do.

34:11.201 --> 34:12.903
He told my partner
that you know

34:12.937 --> 34:14.839
exactly
what's in that bag.

34:18.876 --> 34:21.211
Two "lali-kay" candlesticks.

34:21.245 --> 34:22.980
Am I pronouncing that right,
"La-li-kay"?

34:23.013 --> 34:24.181
Lalique.

34:24.214 --> 34:25.883
That's glass.
Glass, right?

34:25.916 --> 34:26.851
It's French glass.

34:26.884 --> 34:29.353
Weird, her bringing
the bag in here like that.

34:29.386 --> 34:30.955
It's your stuff.

34:30.988 --> 34:32.890
You'd think she'd just
call you about it.

34:32.923 --> 34:35.425
I guess people just like
to cooperate with the police.

34:35.459 --> 34:37.194
James gave me this bag

34:37.227 --> 34:39.730
and said that you
shot Len Sand.

34:39.764 --> 34:42.032
[Whispers]
That you shot his husband.

34:42.066 --> 34:43.801
He's finalizing

34:43.834 --> 34:46.804
his official statement
with Detective Crews right now.

34:49.774 --> 34:51.809
You got a first edition book
on bondage.

34:51.842 --> 34:53.477
Of human bondage.

34:53.510 --> 34:55.946
Oh. By "Mog-ham"?

34:55.980 --> 34:56.947
Maugham.

34:56.981 --> 34:58.749
French, like the glass?

34:58.783 --> 35:01.085
English,
like the language.

35:01.118 --> 35:03.788
He says you shot Len Sand
using that gun, Stephanie.

35:03.821 --> 35:05.956
It has your husband's
fingerprints all over it.

35:05.990 --> 35:07.024
My husband's prints.

35:07.057 --> 35:08.458
James said
you wanted to set Drew up

35:08.492 --> 35:10.527
for that murder,
so you shot Len Sand

35:10.560 --> 35:12.296
and left the gun
and these other objects

35:12.329 --> 35:13.831
for us to find.

35:13.864 --> 35:15.032
Why would I do that?

35:15.065 --> 35:16.834
I had no motive
to kill Len.

35:16.867 --> 35:17.835
I liked him.

35:17.868 --> 35:19.503
We couldn't figure out
the motive.

35:19.536 --> 35:21.238
You didn't get anything
from Len Sand's death.

35:21.271 --> 35:24.008
That's true.
I didn't.

35:24.041 --> 35:26.844
But you'd get everything
if Drew was blamed for it.

35:26.877 --> 35:28.979
Come on, Stephanie.
Drew's rich, you're not.

35:29.013 --> 35:31.348
He controls all the money.

35:31.381 --> 35:32.983
Your prenup states
that you get everything

35:33.017 --> 35:34.518
if Drew gives you
cause for a divorce.

35:34.551 --> 35:36.286
Now, a murder conviction.

35:36.320 --> 35:37.454
Guess what?
That's cause.

35:37.487 --> 35:38.889
You and James
both make out.

35:38.923 --> 35:40.157
You get all
of Drew's money,

35:40.190 --> 35:42.359
he gets all
of Len Sand's.

35:42.392 --> 35:45.830
But James over there...

35:45.863 --> 35:47.832
Got cold feet
and brought us this bag.

35:47.865 --> 35:48.999
Okay, let me see.
Almost done.

35:49.033 --> 35:50.534
Here we go.

35:50.567 --> 35:52.970
One Patek Philippe
chronograph.

35:53.003 --> 35:54.438
What is that?

35:54.471 --> 35:55.873
A watch.

35:55.906 --> 35:58.042
You should have just
put that down here.

35:58.075 --> 35:59.977
I'll fix that for ya.
It's okay.

36:00.010 --> 36:02.179
W-a-t-c-h.

36:02.212 --> 36:03.848
Watch.

36:03.881 --> 36:08.018
He says you shot Sand,
Stephanie.

36:08.052 --> 36:09.486
He gave us this bag

36:09.519 --> 36:11.856
and said
that you shot Sand.

36:11.889 --> 36:13.323
You had access
to your husband's gun.

36:13.357 --> 36:15.826
It makes sense.

36:19.396 --> 36:21.866
But these
are all on the list.

36:21.899 --> 36:23.400
Just one last item here.

36:23.433 --> 36:26.170
We got
an automatic .40 caliber.

36:29.039 --> 36:31.308
That's a gun, James.

36:31.341 --> 36:34.044
Should I write it down
that way?

36:34.078 --> 36:36.346
G...U...

36:36.380 --> 36:37.948
N.

36:37.982 --> 36:39.216
Come on, Stephanie.
Time's running out.

36:41.018 --> 36:43.453
Talk now or pay later.

36:43.487 --> 36:45.990
Okay, okay. I...

36:46.023 --> 36:47.591
I-I did take the gun.

36:49.393 --> 36:51.028
Okay, but I didn't kill Len.

36:51.061 --> 36:53.063
Okay, I gave the gun
to James.

36:53.097 --> 36:54.364
He shot him.

36:54.398 --> 36:57.134
He did it-- look,
I was gonna get Drew's money.

36:57.167 --> 36:58.368
He was gonna get Len's.

36:58.402 --> 37:00.104
But I never
shot anyone, okay?

37:00.137 --> 37:02.072
We were gonna frame Drew,

37:02.106 --> 37:04.308
but James shot Len--
not me.

37:06.476 --> 37:08.412
Not me.

37:08.445 --> 37:10.414
They've been in there a long
time, my partner and Stephanie.

37:10.447 --> 37:12.116
I wonder what
they're talking about.

37:12.149 --> 37:13.650
Stephanie's
pretty high-strung.

37:13.683 --> 37:15.452
You notice that?

37:17.087 --> 37:20.090
Oh, God.
What did you tell them?

37:20.124 --> 37:21.892
What have you done?

37:21.926 --> 37:22.960
[Yelling]
What have you done?

37:25.262 --> 37:26.263
James.

37:26.296 --> 37:28.632
You put your bag
on the hillside,

37:28.665 --> 37:30.667
knowing we'd find it.

37:30.700 --> 37:35.672
You didn't count on
Holt Easley finding it first

37:35.705 --> 37:37.674
and burying it.

37:37.707 --> 37:39.910
That was gonna be
his treasure.

37:47.613 --> 37:49.482
Easley:
That bag of stolen stuff
I found

37:49.515 --> 37:50.483
was gonna be my ticket.

37:50.916 --> 37:52.852
Well, you want to stay
at my house for a while,

37:52.885 --> 37:54.320
that's not a problem.

37:54.354 --> 37:56.255
Sure, boss.
Just might do that.

37:56.288 --> 37:59.024
That way, he can use
the bathroom when he wants to

37:59.058 --> 38:00.626
without committing
a felony.

38:00.660 --> 38:02.227
Well, a man's
gotta stay minty.

38:02.261 --> 38:03.796
Isn't that right,
Easley?

38:03.829 --> 38:05.264
That's right.

38:05.297 --> 38:07.099
[Blows]

38:07.132 --> 38:08.167
See? Minty.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.942
Interviewer:
And the daughter,
where was she?

38:16.976 --> 38:18.310
She was at a sleepover.

38:18.343 --> 38:20.713
How many times
I gotta tell you that?

38:33.192 --> 38:35.027
She was there,
wasn't she?

38:42.134 --> 38:44.670
Her bed was unmade.

38:44.704 --> 38:46.105
She was there
when it happened,

38:46.138 --> 38:47.740
not at a sleepover.

38:49.809 --> 38:51.110
Rachel was in the house.

39:32.852 --> 39:35.988
[Hinges squeak]

39:36.021 --> 39:37.056
[Door closes]

39:37.089 --> 39:39.024
[Heartfelt rock music]

39:39.058 --> 39:40.325
Hello?

39:42.094 --> 39:43.162
Hello.

39:49.001 --> 39:52.037
Jeez, Charlie.
You scared me.

39:52.071 --> 39:53.939
I didn't mean to.

39:53.973 --> 39:56.008
What are you doing here?

39:56.041 --> 39:57.877
Uh...

39:57.910 --> 39:59.912
I, uh...

39:59.945 --> 40:01.681
I wanna ask you
to do something,

40:01.714 --> 40:03.248
and I just need you
to do it.

40:03.282 --> 40:06.185
Charlie, tell me
why you're here.

40:06.218 --> 40:09.989
I need you to drop
Neil Cudahy as a client.

40:11.123 --> 40:13.092
You need me to?

40:13.125 --> 40:14.393
What does that mean?

40:14.426 --> 40:15.961
You know what
that means.

40:15.995 --> 40:18.130
Do you want to save him,
Connie?

40:18.163 --> 40:19.932
I'm just defending him.

40:19.965 --> 40:22.968
Do you wanna save him
like you saved me?

40:23.002 --> 40:25.204
'Cause he's not me,
Connie.

40:26.405 --> 40:27.907
What are you asking?

40:27.940 --> 40:30.042
I'm asking you
to drop Neil Cudahy.

40:31.977 --> 40:33.412
That's all you're
asking?

40:33.445 --> 40:35.014
Yeah.

40:37.149 --> 40:39.051
Don't back away
from this, Charlie.

40:39.084 --> 40:41.987
You started it
when you came here tonight.

40:42.021 --> 40:44.156
I just want you
to drop Neil Cudahy.

40:44.189 --> 40:47.392
You don't have the right

40:47.426 --> 40:50.262
to ask that.

40:50.295 --> 40:53.032
Unless you want
that right.

40:53.065 --> 40:55.034
Do you, Charlie?

40:57.502 --> 41:00.840
I was looking for you,
and I didn't even know it.

41:04.409 --> 41:06.812
And now you're here,
and I can't have you.

41:06.846 --> 41:09.014
You're married.

41:09.048 --> 41:11.683
And if I weren't?

41:13.152 --> 41:15.054
You have a husband.

41:15.087 --> 41:18.423
And I think about...
You...

41:18.457 --> 41:20.392
When I'm with him.

41:24.529 --> 41:28.000
I need you to be
all the way in.

41:29.935 --> 41:33.238
And if you can't be
all the way in...

41:36.876 --> 41:40.880
Then I need you
all the way... out.

41:42.514 --> 41:44.383
You know
I can't do this.

41:49.321 --> 41:52.057
Yeah. Okay.

41:54.459 --> 41:57.830
Whatever it is
that you're doing

41:57.863 --> 41:59.865
is keeping you
from being here.

41:59.899 --> 42:01.500
You're still in prison.

42:06.105 --> 42:08.874
The next time you're gonna have
to get another lawyer

42:08.908 --> 42:10.009
to get you out.

42:22.587 --> 42:25.024
He was here
this afternoon.

42:25.057 --> 42:26.491
I saw him.

42:26.525 --> 42:30.162
He asked if I would buy him
a giant rubber band.

42:30.195 --> 42:31.831
Said he used to have one

42:31.864 --> 42:33.332
but that it... dried up.

42:33.365 --> 42:36.068
Lost its snap.

42:36.101 --> 42:37.937
Poor Easley.

42:37.970 --> 42:40.239
I thought telling the truth
would set him free.

42:40.272 --> 42:41.240
[Snorts]

42:41.273 --> 42:42.574
When's that ever worked?

42:42.607 --> 42:45.144
[Music gets louder]

42:45.177 --> 42:53.185
♫

43:30.222 --> 43:32.591
[Crews, whispering]
She saw him.

43:32.624 --> 43:35.327
She saw the killer.

44:09.929 --> 44:09.995
Is it done yet?
