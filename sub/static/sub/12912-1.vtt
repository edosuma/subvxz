[indistinct chattering]

[exhales]

02:45.860 --> 02:47.420
That was amazing!

02:47.500 --> 02:50.420
I can't believe I've never seen
that part of the reef before.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.020
Told you we knew a few secret spots.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.860
I can't wait to meet the pod tonight.

02:55.940 --> 02:58.340
It's your first full moon ceremony.
Are you excited?

02:58.420 --> 02:59.940
Uh, do mermaids have scales?

03:00.020 --> 03:02.420
-[giggles]
-See?

03:02.500 --> 03:04.860
There are some perks
to having a moon ring.

03:05.940 --> 03:07.020
[chuckles]

03:08.900 --> 03:10.420
[Ondina] Whoo!

03:11.780 --> 03:13.140
-Hey.
-Hi.

03:14.140 --> 03:15.460
-[kisses]
-[giggles]

03:16.740 --> 03:18.220
I haven't ordered anything.

03:18.300 --> 03:22.700
It's my new smoothie flavor.
Fresh prawns and oysters.

03:22.780 --> 03:24.140
Oh.

03:25.380 --> 03:27.100
I'm joking.
It's mango.

03:27.180 --> 03:28.220
[both chuckle]

03:28.300 --> 03:32.060
So, what time are we all heading
to Mako tonight?

03:32.140 --> 03:34.300
-Um... "we"?
-Yeah, I thought I'd tag along,

03:34.380 --> 03:36.780
-check out this full moon gig.
-It's not a gig, it's a ceremony.

03:36.860 --> 03:38.380
And it's mermaids only.

03:38.460 --> 03:40.580
He's just stirring.
We're having a card night tonight.

03:41.420 --> 03:42.620
[Cam] Hey, David.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.900
You want to hang out
with Zac and me tonight?

03:44.980 --> 03:47.700
Play some cards...
It'll take your mind off, you know...

03:49.460 --> 03:51.620
-Sirena.
-I really miss her.

03:51.700 --> 03:54.140
I know she deserves
a holiday with her sister, but...

03:54.220 --> 03:55.940
Hawaii is just so far away.

03:56.020 --> 03:57.740
I guess it is a bit far
to visit in the tinny.

04:04.580 --> 04:06.780
-[girls giggling]
-[indistinct chatter]

04:10.180 --> 04:13.060
-Veridia.
-Is everything all right?

04:13.140 --> 04:16.260
Everything's fine.
Veridia and I are just catching up.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.660
I'm glad that you're here.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.540
I have a special job for you, Ondina.

04:20.620 --> 04:22.180
Now that the pod has returned home,

04:22.260 --> 04:24.900
we're in need of a smart,
talented mermaid.

04:24.980 --> 04:28.060
Someone with the courage and skill
you've demonstrated.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.740
-Whatever it is, I'm ready.
-Good.

04:31.820 --> 04:33.140
We need a teacher.

04:35.020 --> 04:38.260
Well, of course, it's...
it's a great honor...

04:38.340 --> 04:39.620
but I'm hardly qualified.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.140
I disagree.

04:41.220 --> 04:44.260
I think you'll make an excellent
role model for the little mermaids.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.820
Are you really friends with the merman?
What's he like?

04:56.900 --> 04:58.500
When can we get our moon rings?

04:58.580 --> 05:00.860
[Amaris] Is it true you live on land?

05:00.940 --> 05:03.180
-Can we go there, too?
-Absolutely not.

05:03.260 --> 05:05.420
Now quiet, all of you.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.980
Why can't we go on land?

05:07.060 --> 05:08.500
[all] Please, Ondina?

05:08.580 --> 05:10.980
-We've never done that before.
-Quiet!

05:11.060 --> 05:12.540
[both sigh]

05:12.620 --> 05:15.100
You have a lot to learn
before you're going anywhere near land.

05:16.060 --> 05:18.860
Starting with the basics.
[sighs]

05:18.940 --> 05:22.580
Now... does anyone know
how to form a water ball?

05:22.660 --> 05:24.700
-Are you kidding me?
-Water balls?

05:24.780 --> 05:26.980
[Amaris] Seriously?
[Naia] Are you joking?

05:38.820 --> 05:40.740
Ah! Perfect timing.

05:40.820 --> 05:43.340
Look, I need you on the trawler today.
My usual deckhand is sick.

05:43.420 --> 05:46.460
-Can't you get someone else?
-If I could, I would.

05:46.540 --> 05:47.900
Okay, you're my last resort.
I promise.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.780
-I've got a café to run.
-Carly will look after it.

05:50.860 --> 05:52.380
-Now hurry up, time is money.
-[claps hands]

05:52.460 --> 05:55.740
You know I'm no good on the trawler.
The diesel fumes make me nauseous.

05:56.500 --> 05:59.100
You're coming, like it or not.
Okay?

06:00.260 --> 06:01.580
[grunts]

06:02.340 --> 06:03.940
[keypad beeping]

06:05.340 --> 06:07.060
Watch carefully.

06:08.300 --> 06:12.460
With a little concentration,
you'll all be doing this in no time.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.420
It even took me
a little while to learn this,

06:15.500 --> 06:17.180
but you have to be patient.

06:25.540 --> 06:29.340
Stop stressing, David.
I'll manage.

06:29.420 --> 06:30.500
Bye.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.020
What's up?

06:40.020 --> 06:42.660
[sighs] David's stuck
on the trawler with Joe.

06:42.740 --> 06:43.980
Looks like he'll be gone all day.

06:44.060 --> 06:46.300
He'd better be back in time
for our card game.

06:46.380 --> 06:49.260
While you're planning the big game,
I've got a café to run...

06:49.340 --> 06:51.100
by myself.

06:51.180 --> 06:52.460
And you're doing a great job.

06:53.300 --> 06:54.700
You could help out a little.

06:55.420 --> 06:56.460
Sure.

06:56.540 --> 06:59.460
Can I get a double cheeseburger?
And fries?

06:59.540 --> 07:01.380
And a choc shake?

07:01.460 --> 07:03.980
You're kidding... right?

07:04.060 --> 07:05.660
I can't work on an empty stomach.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.700
[scoffs]

07:13.700 --> 07:17.300
-What?
-You have a lot to learn, my friend.

07:20.300 --> 07:23.740
See?
It just takes practice.

07:26.460 --> 07:29.180
-Where is Amaris?
-She went that way.

07:29.940 --> 07:32.620
[sighs] Wonderful.

07:43.180 --> 07:44.940
[Joe] Well, it's about time.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.580
[gasping]

07:59.380 --> 08:00.780
[grunting]

08:10.740 --> 08:12.180
[whispering] Amaris?

08:13.380 --> 08:14.780
[panting]

08:32.419 --> 08:34.539
Don't be scared.
I won't hurt you.

08:36.419 --> 08:37.500
[groans]

08:45.020 --> 08:47.820
Oi! What are you doing?

08:50.060 --> 08:51.420
Quit clowning around, will you?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.700
-That's okay, I'll get it.
-Oh, you know what? No, no, no, no, no.

08:55.780 --> 08:58.900
Take a rest, mate.
You've done too much already.

08:58.980 --> 09:00.180
[gasps]

09:00.260 --> 09:01.820
Don't worry.
I'll get you out of here.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.260
Relax, relax, okay?
I'll do everything.

09:04.340 --> 09:05.660
[David] It's all right.
I'll... I'll get it.

09:05.740 --> 09:07.140
Actually, you know what?
Get those crates on board.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.020
Whoa!

09:13.380 --> 09:14.740
What was that?
Come on.

09:31.660 --> 09:32.940
Go.

09:47.100 --> 09:50.100
Don't you ever do anything
like that again. Understand?

09:50.180 --> 09:53.820
-You can't go near land people.
-But you do.

09:53.900 --> 09:56.100
I'm older.
I can handle it.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.980
You know you were nearly trapped, right?

09:58.060 --> 10:02.340
Yes, Ondina,
but that mermaid saved me.

10:02.420 --> 10:03.980
Who is she?

10:07.980 --> 10:10.260
She was using magic in broad daylight.

10:10.340 --> 10:12.420
-Did anyone see her?
-I don't think so.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.420
And you're sure
that she wasn't from our pod?

10:14.500 --> 10:15.860
I've never seen her before.

10:15.940 --> 10:18.900
What kind of mermaid would risk
our secret like that?

10:20.540 --> 10:21.660
[Rita] Girls.

10:22.660 --> 10:25.940
I'm glad you're here.
I'd like you to meet Weilan.

10:26.580 --> 10:27.980
She's from Shanghai

10:28.060 --> 10:29.700
and she's going to be staying with us
for a while.

10:30.620 --> 10:33.300
-Good to meet you, Weilan.
-My pleasure to be here.

10:33.380 --> 10:37.980
I visited Shanghai years ago.
Weilan's family were very welcoming.

10:38.060 --> 10:41.980
I'll expect you to offer her
the same degree of hospitality.

10:42.060 --> 10:43.820
Of course.

10:43.900 --> 10:46.340
I have to go,
but the girls will show you around.

10:52.020 --> 10:54.940
-What do you think you were doing?
-Excuse me?

10:55.020 --> 10:57.060
At the marina.
I saw you.

10:57.140 --> 10:58.500
I was helping the little mermaid.

10:58.580 --> 11:01.020
[scoffs] I'm her teacher.
I had it under control.

11:01.100 --> 11:02.180
Of course.

11:02.260 --> 11:05.660
Letting her wander into a net is all
part of the learning experience, right?

11:05.740 --> 11:08.580
-Why don't we show you around?
-Great.

11:18.540 --> 11:20.540
Nice place.

11:20.620 --> 11:22.500
You haven't seen anything yet.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.820
Cool!

11:42.140 --> 11:43.780
This place is amazing.

11:43.860 --> 11:44.980
[Poseidon meows]

11:45.060 --> 11:48.940
[gasps] And you have a cat!
I love cats!

11:51.300 --> 11:53.220
[Mimmi] His name is Poseidon.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.860
-Hello.
-[purring]

11:58.580 --> 12:00.100
What are you doing here?

12:01.060 --> 12:02.980
I... needed a holiday.

12:03.060 --> 12:05.540
[gasps] You're so gorgeous.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.860
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[chuckles]

12:10.940 --> 12:12.180
You have a phone?

12:13.580 --> 12:14.700
Yeah.

12:16.380 --> 12:18.860
So, what does a mermaid do
for fun around here?

12:19.620 --> 12:22.340
I'm not your tour guide.
I'm going to the moon pool.

12:22.420 --> 12:24.300
The moon pool?

12:26.060 --> 12:29.260
-Would you like to see it?
-I don't think she'd be interested.

12:29.340 --> 12:33.060
Are you kidding?
The famous Mako moon pool?

12:33.140 --> 12:35.460
I'd love to see it.

12:40.340 --> 12:41.940
Well, something must have caused it.

12:42.020 --> 12:44.780
Things just don't go...
[whooshes] flying into the air.

12:44.860 --> 12:47.980
-Maybe it was a gust of wind.
-A gust of...

12:48.900 --> 12:50.500
You know what?
Just leave it. Okay?

12:50.580 --> 12:52.500
-We've got to get under way.
-Oh, we're not still going out?

12:53.220 --> 12:55.580
Of course we are.
Come on, we've got fish to catch!

12:56.460 --> 12:57.900
Casting off!

12:59.700 --> 13:00.900
[engine starting]

13:19.020 --> 13:20.260
[Mimmi] Here we are.

13:21.820 --> 13:22.980
What do you think?

13:24.100 --> 13:25.220
I thought it'd be bigger.

13:25.300 --> 13:29.340
You know, with fountains and jewels
and maybe a flat screen TV.

13:29.420 --> 13:30.540
Unbelievable.

13:30.620 --> 13:31.900
Kidding!

13:31.980 --> 13:34.980
-We sleep here every night.
-[Weilan] Really?

13:35.060 --> 13:36.820
I prefer a soft, dry bed.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.140
I hear there's one waiting for you
in Shanghai.

13:39.220 --> 13:40.460
[Mimmi] Ondina.

13:42.620 --> 13:45.020
Maybe we can go somewhere else.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.260
The full moon ceremony is tonight.
You should come.

13:47.340 --> 13:48.500
She doesn't have a moon ring.

13:52.300 --> 13:53.900
Thanks, but...

13:53.980 --> 13:55.860
to be honest,
I'm more comfortable on land.

13:56.820 --> 13:58.900
I bet your pod's thrilled about that.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.180
I don't have a pod.

14:06.820 --> 14:09.700
-Why not?
-Thanks for showing me around.

14:09.780 --> 14:12.420
[Mimmi] At least come to the café tonight
before we go.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.700
You can meet some of our friends.

14:18.420 --> 14:19.740
Sounds great.

14:24.980 --> 14:26.900
Why are you being so nice to her?

14:26.980 --> 14:29.420
She's a mermaid, just like us.

14:29.980 --> 14:31.620
She is not like us.

14:44.660 --> 14:46.260
[David] I think I'm gonna be sick.

14:47.700 --> 14:48.740
Take your mind off it.

14:49.740 --> 14:52.500
Think about... raw squid.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.580
Lasagna.

14:55.700 --> 14:57.260
Roller coasters.

14:57.340 --> 14:58.420
[coughs]

14:59.340 --> 15:00.740
[laughs]

15:02.180 --> 15:03.580
Get the nets ready, will you?

15:09.500 --> 15:10.740
[Weilan] Let me get this straight.

15:10.820 --> 15:15.100
The guy with the boat at the dock
was David, but he knows about us.

15:15.180 --> 15:16.620
And so does Cam.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.180
And Evie.

15:18.260 --> 15:20.700
-And she has a tail?
-Right.

15:20.780 --> 15:24.300
And Evie's boyfriend, Zac, is my brother.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.900
-He's a merman.
-Your brother is a merman?

15:29.820 --> 15:32.260
[exhales] This I have to see.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.060
Everyone, meet Weilan.

15:44.140 --> 15:48.660
Weilan, this is Evie and Cam...
and Zac.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.660
So you're a merman.

15:53.900 --> 15:54.980
Huh!

15:56.060 --> 15:57.300
What?

15:57.860 --> 16:00.300
Nothing, it's just...
I thought you'd be bigger.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.660
Don't worry, Zac.
She's difficult to please.

16:02.740 --> 16:04.340
You guys ready to order?

16:04.420 --> 16:07.100
Carly, this is Weilan.
She'll be staying with us for a while.

16:08.140 --> 16:10.700
I'm guessing you're another, um...

16:12.780 --> 16:15.620
Is that some kind of secret code?

16:17.300 --> 16:19.980
Yes, Weilan is a mermaid.

16:20.060 --> 16:23.900
Is there anybody here
who doesn't know about mermaids?

16:39.180 --> 16:42.020
So, I'm guessing by your accent,
you're not from around here?

16:42.100 --> 16:46.380
I'm from the Northern Pod,
but I've been here since I was very young.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.940
Why don't you have a pod?

16:52.700 --> 16:55.660
Shouldn't we be going?
We don't want to be late.

16:57.460 --> 16:58.700
[Zac] Have fun out there.

16:59.900 --> 17:01.300
-Thanks.
-[Mimmi] Don't worry.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.020
We'll bring her back safe and sound.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.540
[sighs]

17:37.780 --> 17:38.940
Ready?

18:15.140 --> 18:17.740
-Everything secure?
-Yes.

18:18.540 --> 18:19.700
Can we go back now?

18:19.780 --> 18:22.780
I might still be able to make
my card game.

18:23.900 --> 18:26.260
-[scoffs]
-[sonar beeping]

18:29.620 --> 18:31.140
What is that?

18:34.060 --> 18:35.180
[loud thud]

18:39.220 --> 18:42.500
-Uh, it must have been a whale.
-That was no whale.

18:43.980 --> 18:45.300
What are you doing?

18:45.380 --> 18:48.580
It's heading to Mako,
and I'm going after it.

18:55.020 --> 18:58.460
[Evie] Where is the pod?
[Ondina] On the other side of Mako.

18:59.740 --> 19:01.260
I've got butterflies.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.540
-You'll be fine.
-Just follow our lead.

19:03.620 --> 19:04.940
[chuckles]

19:13.940 --> 19:15.860
What's up?

19:15.940 --> 19:17.220
I don't know.

19:22.740 --> 19:24.420
What's that?

19:41.740 --> 19:43.260
[growling]

19:43.340 --> 19:44.340
[roars]

19:46.260 --> 19:49.540
Nothing from David.
Looks like it's just you and me.

19:50.380 --> 19:52.380
It's a shame.
He's so easy to fleece.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.620
Come on, let's play some cards.

19:57.940 --> 19:59.500
[Cam] You okay?

19:59.580 --> 20:01.740
-Mimmi is in danger.
-What?

20:02.300 --> 20:05.300
It looks... like a dragon.

20:05.380 --> 20:07.580
[sighs] Oh, no.

20:07.660 --> 20:09.300
I have to go.

20:14.580 --> 20:17.300
Come on. Come on!

20:17.380 --> 20:19.580
-Shouldn't we alert the coast guard?
-The coast guard?

20:19.660 --> 20:21.460
What, and let them take all the glory?

20:21.540 --> 20:24.100
No way!
This could be the biggest haul of my life.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.460
Whoo!

20:57.740 --> 20:59.580
-[crackling]
-[roaring]

21:16.380 --> 21:17.740
[sonar beeping]

21:20.940 --> 21:22.060
Whoa!

21:23.700 --> 21:25.940
-[roaring]
-[both screaming]

21:30.100 --> 21:31.420
[growling]

21:32.860 --> 21:35.860
-What is that?
-We've got to go.

21:35.940 --> 21:37.980
-David's on that boat.
-He'll be fine.

21:38.060 --> 21:40.180
Are you kidding?
Look at that thing.

21:40.260 --> 21:42.100
It doesn't want land people.
Only mermaids.

21:42.180 --> 21:43.580
-How do you know?
-[Weilan] There's no time.

21:43.660 --> 21:45.100
We have to warn your pod.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.820
[dragon growling]

21:56.380 --> 21:57.940
[roaring]

22:13.180 --> 22:14.580
Thanks to your warning,

22:14.660 --> 22:17.100
the pod are now safe
in the caves under Mako.

22:18.180 --> 22:21.700
-What was that thing?
-I've never seen anything like it.

22:22.780 --> 22:24.020
I have.

22:27.460 --> 22:30.260
The dragon appeared
a month ago in Shanghai.

22:31.180 --> 22:33.540
Weilan's grandmother sent her here
for safekeeping.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.540
You didn't think of telling us?

22:35.620 --> 22:38.420
We need to understand this threat
and find a way to stop it.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.860
There is no way.

22:41.180 --> 22:42.260
There has to be.

22:42.340 --> 22:46.300
The dragon's sole purpose
is to destroy mermaids.

22:47.140 --> 22:51.860
It wiped out the Eastern Pod,
and now it has come here.

22:53.620 --> 22:55.020
No mermaid is safe.
