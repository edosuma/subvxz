01:08.600 --> 01:11.240
- Kent.
- My lord.

01:20.840 --> 01:21.840
Come on.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.760
I thought the king had more affected
the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.120
It did always seem so to us,
but now in the division of the kingdom

01:29.200 --> 01:31.920
it appears not which of the dukes
he values most,

01:32.000 --> 01:33.440
for qualities are so weighed

01:33.520 --> 01:36.760
that curiosity in neither
can make choice of either's moiety.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.600
Is not this your son, my lord?

01:40.600 --> 01:43.320
His breeding, sir, hath been at my
charge.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.680
I've so often blushed to acknowledge him
that now I am brazed to it.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.200
I cannot conceive you.

01:48.280 --> 01:51.160
Sir,
this young fellow's mother could.

01:51.240 --> 01:54.280
Though this knave came
something saucily into the world,

01:54.360 --> 01:57.760
there was good sport at his making
and the whoreson must be acknowledged.

01:58.560 --> 02:01.360
- Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?
- No, my lord.

02:01.440 --> 02:05.240
My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter
as my honourable friend.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.479
He has been out nine years
and away he shall again.

02:19.520 --> 02:20.920
The king is coming.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.960
Attend the Lords of France and Burgundy,
Gloucester.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.680
Ay, my good lord.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.040
Meantime we shall express
our darker purpose.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.720
Give me the map there.

03:11.160 --> 03:13.960
Know that we have divided in three
our kingdom.

03:14.720 --> 03:18.080
'Tis our fast intent to shake
all cares and business from our age,

03:18.160 --> 03:20.480
conferring them on younger strengths,

03:20.560 --> 03:24.600
while we unburdened
crawl toward death.

03:25.760 --> 03:30.240
Our son of Cornwall, and you,
our no less loving son of Albany,

03:30.320 --> 03:34.960
we have this hour a constant will
to publish our daughters' several dowers,

03:35.040 --> 03:38.160
that future strife may be prevented now.

03:38.880 --> 03:44.080
The princes France and Burgundy, great
rivals in our youngest daughter's love,

03:44.160 --> 03:47.480
long in our court have made
their amorous sojourn,

03:47.560 --> 03:49.480
and here are to be answered.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.320
Tell me, my daughters,

03:51.400 --> 03:55.720
since now we will divest us both of rule,
interest of territory, cares of state,

03:56.600 --> 03:59.920
which of you shall we say
doth love us most,

04:00.000 --> 04:04.840
that we our largest bounty may extend
where nature doth with merit challenge?

04:04.920 --> 04:08.960
Goneril, our eldest born, speak first.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.160
Sir…

04:13.240 --> 04:16.600
I love you more than words
can wield the matter.

04:17.519 --> 04:22.480
Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty,

04:22.560 --> 04:25.240
beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,

04:25.640 --> 04:30.200
no less than life,
with grace, health, beauty, honour,

04:30.280 --> 04:35.200
as much as child e'er loved,
or father found,

04:36.560 --> 04:39.800
a love that makes breath poor
and speech unable.

04:41.280 --> 04:45.080
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.840
Of all these bounds,

04:51.000 --> 04:56.720
even from this line to this, with shadowy
forests and with champains riched,

04:56.800 --> 05:00.000
with plenteous rivers
and wide-skirted meads,

05:00.080 --> 05:01.440
we make thee lady.

05:02.720 --> 05:07.440
To thine and Albany's issue
be this perpetual.

05:07.520 --> 05:13.520
What says our second daughter,
our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall?

05:14.520 --> 05:15.680
Speak.

05:16.680 --> 05:21.680
Er… I am made of that self mettle
as my sister, and prize me at her worth.

05:22.720 --> 05:27.080
In my true heart,
I find she names my very deed of love.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.680
Only she comes too short:

05:29.760 --> 05:34.360
that I profess myself an enemy
to all other joys

05:34.440 --> 05:37.520
which the most precious
square of sense possesses,

05:37.600 --> 05:41.920
and find I am alone felicitate
in your dear highness' love.

05:44.360 --> 05:47.320
And to thee and thine hereditary ever

05:47.400 --> 05:50.560
remain this ample third
of our fair kingdom,

05:50.640 --> 05:56.000
no less in space, validity and pleasure
than that conferred on Goneril.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.880
Now our joy, although the last and least,

06:02.960 --> 06:07.800
to whose young love the vines of France
and milk of Burgundy

06:07.880 --> 06:11.720
strive to be interessed.

06:11.800 --> 06:16.680
What can you say to draw a third
more opulent than your sisters?

06:16.760 --> 06:18.840
Speak.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.680
Nothing, my lord.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.720
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.880
Well, nothing will come of nothing.
Speak again.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.240
Unhappy that I am, I cannot
heave my heart into my mouth.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.440
I love your majesty according to my bond,
no more nor less.

06:44.120 --> 06:48.640
How now, Cordelia? Mend your speech
a little, lest you may mar your fortunes.

06:48.720 --> 06:53.640
Ay, my good lord, you have
begot me, bred me, loved me.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.120
I return those duties back
as are right fit:

06:56.800 --> 06:59.320
obey you, love you, and most honour you.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.440
Why have my sisters husbands
if they say they love you all?

07:05.680 --> 07:09.120
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters
to love my father all.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.320
But goes thy heart with this?

07:18.480 --> 07:19.760
Ay, my good lord.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.440
So young, and so untender?

07:29.520 --> 07:31.640
So young, my lord, and true.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.640
Let it be so. Thy truth then be thy
dower.

07:35.160 --> 07:37.080
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,

07:37.160 --> 07:41.280
and as a stranger to my heart and me
hold thee from this for ever.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.760
- Good my liege…
- Peace, Kent!

07:42.840 --> 07:44.680
Come not between the dragon and his
wrath.

07:44.760 --> 07:49.200
I loved her most, and thought
to set my rest on her kind nursery.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.680
Hence, and avoid my sight!

07:57.120 --> 07:59.640
Call France. Who stirs? Call Burgundy!

07:59.720 --> 08:01.040
Ha, ha!

08:01.120 --> 08:04.560
Cornwall and Albany, with my two
daughters' dowers digest the third.

08:04.640 --> 08:08.800
Let pride, which she calls plainness,
marry her.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
I do invest you jointly
with my power, pre-eminence,

08:14.080 --> 08:16.840
and all the large effects
that troop with majesty.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.800
Ourself by monthly course,
with reservation of…

08:23.440 --> 08:27.200
an hundred knights,
by you to be sustained,

08:28.080 --> 08:30.400
shall our abode make with you by due
turn.

08:31.400 --> 08:35.280
Only we still retain the name
and all the addition to a king.

08:36.120 --> 08:39.039
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
beloved sons, be yours.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.080
Royal Lear, whom I have
ever honoured as my king,

08:42.159 --> 08:44.960
as my great patron
thought on in my prayers…

08:45.040 --> 08:47.960
The bow is bent and drawn,
make from the shaft.

08:48.040 --> 08:51.240
Let it fall rather, though the fork
invade the region of my heart.

08:52.120 --> 08:55.480
Be Kent unmannerly when Lear is mad?

08:55.880 --> 08:57.320
What wouldst thou do, old man?

08:57.400 --> 09:01.240
Thinkest thou that duty shall have dread
to speak when power to flattery bows?

09:01.320 --> 09:03.240
Kent, on thy life, no more!

09:03.320 --> 09:06.440
My life I never held but as a pawn
to wage against thine enemies.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.360
- Out of my sight!
- Dear sir, forbear…

09:08.440 --> 09:10.960
- See better, Lear!
- Now, by Apollo…

09:11.040 --> 09:13.360
Oh, now, by Apollo, king.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.920
Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
I'll tell thee, thou dost evil.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.440
Hear me, recreant.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.480
On thine allegiance, hear me!

09:25.960 --> 09:30.320
That thou hast sought to make us
break our vows, which we durst never yet,

09:30.400 --> 09:33.400
our potency made good, take thy reward.

09:33.480 --> 09:36.000
Five days we do allot thee, for provision

09:36.080 --> 09:38.720
to shield thee
from diseases of the world,

09:38.800 --> 09:42.280
and on the sixth to turn
thy hated back upon our kingdom.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.480
If, on the tenth day following,

09:44.560 --> 09:48.040
thy banished trunk be found in our
dominions, the moment is thy death.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.880
Away, by Jupiter.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.200
This shall not be revoked!

10:00.920 --> 10:03.040
Here's France and Burgundy, my noble
lord!

10:13.160 --> 10:14.440
My noble lord.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.600
My Lord of Burgundy,

10:19.680 --> 10:22.920
we first address towards you, who with
this king hath rivalled for our daughter.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.760
What in the least will you require
in present dower with her

10:27.560 --> 10:29.000
or cease your quest of love?

10:29.080 --> 10:32.400
Most royal majesty, I crave no more
than hath your highness offered,

10:32.960 --> 10:34.080
nor will you tender less.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.440
Right noble Burgundy, when she was
dear to us, we did hold her so.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.560
But now her price is fallen.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.840
Sir, there she stands. If aught
within that little seeming substance,

10:42.920 --> 10:45.040
or all of it, with our displeasure
pieced,

10:45.120 --> 10:47.680
and nothing more,
may fitly like your grace,

10:47.760 --> 10:50.360
she's there, and she is yours.

10:52.840 --> 10:53.840
I know no answer.

10:54.760 --> 10:58.760
Will you with those infirmities she owes,
unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,

10:58.840 --> 11:02.600
dowered with our curse
and strangered with our oath,

11:02.680 --> 11:04.760
- take her or leave her?
- Pardon me, royal sir.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.800
Election makes not up in such conditions.

11:06.880 --> 11:11.200
Then leave her, sir, for by the power
that made me I tell you all her wealth.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.880
For you, great king,

11:14.960 --> 11:18.560
I would not from your love make
such a stray to match you where I hate.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.240
I yet beseech your majesty
that you make it known

11:21.320 --> 11:24.080
it is no vicious blot, murder,
or foulness,

11:24.160 --> 11:26.320
no unchaste action or dishonoured step

11:26.400 --> 11:29.480
that hath deprived me
of your grace and favour.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.640
Better thou hadst not been born…

11:37.840 --> 11:39.800
than not to have pleased me better.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.320
My Lord of Burgundy, what say you
to the lady? Will you have her?

11:48.840 --> 11:52.040
Give but that portion
which yourself proposed,

11:52.120 --> 11:54.880
and I will make Cordelia
Duchess of Burgundy.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.520
Nothing. I have sworn, I am firm.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.240
I am sorry, then.

12:03.080 --> 12:08.120
You have so… lost a father
that you must lose a husband.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.280
Peace be with Burgundy.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.720
Since that respect and fortunes
are his love, I shall not be his wife.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.040
Fairest Cordelia,

12:20.120 --> 12:24.400
thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.440
Thou hast her, king.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.440
Let her be thine,

12:28.520 --> 12:33.280
for we have no such daughter, nor shall
ever see that face of hers again.

12:34.040 --> 12:37.240
Therefore be gone,
without our grace, our love,

12:39.760 --> 12:41.160
our benison.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.600
Come!

13:00.280 --> 13:02.360
Bid farewell to your sisters.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.400
Love well our father.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.480
Prescribe not us our duty.

13:10.560 --> 13:15.000
Let your study be to content your lord,
who hath received you at fortune's alms.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.240
I think our father will hence tonight.

13:18.320 --> 13:21.320
That's most certain, and with you.
Next month with us.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.760
You see how full of changes his age is.
He always loved our sister most

13:24.840 --> 13:28.120
and with what poor judgement he hath
now cast her off appears too grossly.

13:28.200 --> 13:32.160
'Tis the infirmity of his age, yet
he hath ever but slenderly known himself.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.400
The best and soundest of his time
hath been but rash.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.640
If our father carry authority
with such disposition as this,

13:37.720 --> 13:38.920
it will but offend us.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.960
- We shall further think on it.
- We must do something, and I' the heat.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.440
Pray, let us hit together.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.640
Thou, Nature, art my goddess.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.920
To thy law my services are bound.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.200
Why bastard?

13:53.280 --> 13:56.480
Wherefore base,
when my dimensions are as well compact,

13:56.560 --> 14:01.760
my mind as generous and my shape
as true as honest madam's issue?

14:03.200 --> 14:05.320
Why brand they me with base?

14:05.400 --> 14:08.280
With baseness? Bastardy?

14:09.600 --> 14:14.040
Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.160
Well, my legiti-mate,

14:19.280 --> 14:23.600
Edmund the base shall top the legitimate.

14:35.840 --> 14:36.840
Excuse me.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.200
Edmund, how now? What news?

14:41.760 --> 14:42.920
I know no news, my lord.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
- What paper were you reading?
- Nothing, my lord.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.240
No?

14:47.320 --> 14:50.680
What needed then that terrible dispatch
of it into your pocket?

14:51.360 --> 14:54.400
The quality of nothing
hath not such need to hide itself.

14:55.040 --> 14:58.240
Let's see. Come, if it be nothing
I shall not need spectacles.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.960
I beseech you, sir, pardon me.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.440
It is a letter from my brother
that I have not all o'er-read,

15:04.520 --> 15:08.800
and for so much as I have perused,
I find it not fit for your o'erlooking.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.280
Give me the letter, sir.

15:19.720 --> 15:20.720
Hmm…

15:22.400 --> 15:26.480
"If our father would sleep
till I waked him,

15:26.560 --> 15:29.240
you should enjoy
half his revenue for ever

15:29.320 --> 15:31.760
and live the beloved of your brother.
Edgar."

15:32.240 --> 15:36.800
"Sleep till I waked him…
Enjoy half his revenue." My son Edgar?

15:36.880 --> 15:40.000
- When came you to this? Who brought it?
- I found it in my room.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.760
You know the character
to be your brother's?

15:42.840 --> 15:45.760
If the matter were good, my lord,
I durst swear it were his,

15:45.840 --> 15:48.760
but in respect of that,
I would fain think it were not.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.440
- It is his.
- It is his hand, my lord,

15:51.520 --> 15:54.120
but I hope his heart
is not in the contents.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.080
Has he never before
sounded you in this business?

15:57.160 --> 16:01.280
Never, my lord, but I have heard him oft
maintain it to be fit

16:01.360 --> 16:04.720
that, sons at perfect age
and fathers declined,

16:04.800 --> 16:07.920
the father should be as ward to the son
and the son manage his revenue.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.360
O villain!

16:10.440 --> 16:13.200
Villain. His very opinion in the letter.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.280
- Go seek him. Where is he?
- I do not well know, my lord.

16:18.720 --> 16:22.800
These late eclipses of the sun and moon
portend no good to us.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.600
We have seen the best of our time.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.720
Find out this villain, Edmund.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.440
It shall lose thee nothing.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.120
Do it carefully.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.080
This is the excellent foppery
of the world,

16:43.160 --> 16:47.000
that when we are sick in fortune,
often the surfeits of our own behaviour,

16:47.080 --> 16:50.920
we make guilty of our disasters
the sun, the moon, and stars,

16:51.000 --> 16:55.760
as if we were villains of necessity,
fools by heavenly compulsion,

16:55.840 --> 16:58.880
knaves, thieves and treasoners
by spherical predominance,

16:58.960 --> 16:59.880
drunkards, liars,

16:59.960 --> 17:03.560
and adulterers by an enforced obedience
of planetary influence,

17:03.640 --> 17:07.400
and all that we are evil in
by a divine thrusting on.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.800
How now, brother Edmund?

17:19.040 --> 17:21.760
O these eclipses
do portend these divisions.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.760
What serious contemplation are you in?

17:30.520 --> 17:34.040
I am thinking, brother,
of a prediction I read this other day.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.720
What should follow these eclipses.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.560
Do you busy yourself with that?

17:39.560 --> 17:42.400
I promise you, the effects
he writes of succeed unhappily.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.680
When saw you my father last?

17:45.600 --> 17:48.440
Er… The night gone by.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.800
Spake you with him?

17:49.880 --> 17:52.600
Ay. Two hours together.

17:53.920 --> 17:57.200
Found you no displeasure in him
by word nor countenance?

17:59.800 --> 18:01.480
None at all.

18:06.880 --> 18:10.840
Bethink yourself
wherein you may have offended him,

18:10.920 --> 18:13.040
and at my entreaty forbear his presence

18:13.120 --> 18:16.600
until some little time hath qualified
the heat of his displeasure,

18:16.680 --> 18:18.520
which at this instant so rageth in him

18:18.600 --> 18:21.080
that with the mischief of your person
it would scarcely allay.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.440
- Some villain hath done me wrong.
- No, that's my fear.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.880
I pray you retire with me to my lodging,

18:25.960 --> 18:28.280
from whence I will fitly bring you
to hear my lord speak.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.600
Pray ye, go.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.880
There's my key.
If you do stir abroad, go armed.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.800
Armed? Brother…

18:36.880 --> 18:38.440
Brother, I advise you to the best.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.680
I have told you what I have
seen and heard but faintly,

18:40.760 --> 18:42.920
nothing like the image and horror of it.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.520
Pray you, away.

18:52.320 --> 18:54.760
A credulous father and a brother noble,

18:54.840 --> 18:58.160
whose nature is so far from doing harms
that he suspects none.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.920
I grow, I prosper.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.920
Now, gods, stand up for bastards.

19:06.120 --> 19:09.160
- Shall I hear from you anon?
- I do serve you in this business.

19:39.280 --> 19:42.320
Now, banished Kent,

19:42.400 --> 19:45.560
if thou canst serve
where thou dost stand condemned,

19:46.080 --> 19:50.800
so may it come, thy master,
whom thou lovest,

19:50.880 --> 19:53.000
shall find thee full of labours.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.360
Let me not stay a jot for dinner!

20:03.240 --> 20:06.880
- How now, what art thou?
- A man, sir.

20:07.680 --> 20:10.480
Oh. What dost thou profess?

20:10.560 --> 20:13.600
I do profess to be no less than I seem.

20:14.680 --> 20:18.120
- Hm… What wouldst thou?
- Service.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.440
- Who wouldst thou serve?
- You.

20:22.520 --> 20:26.160
- Dost thou know me, fellow?
- No, sir.

20:26.240 --> 20:29.640
But you have that in your countenance

20:29.720 --> 20:32.400
which I would fain call master.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.440
What's that?

20:34.520 --> 20:36.120
- Authority.
- Ah.

20:37.720 --> 20:39.440
Well, follow me. Thou shalt serve me.

20:40.440 --> 20:44.560
If I like thee no worse after dinner,
I will not part from thee yet.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.200
- Dinner ho!
- Dinner ho!

20:48.000 --> 20:51.040
Dinner ho! Dinner ho!

20:51.120 --> 20:54.600
Dinner ho! Dinner ho!
Dinner ho! Dinner ho!

21:00.520 --> 21:05.560
Dinner ho! Dinner ho!
Dinner ho! Dinner ho! Dinner ho!

21:08.720 --> 21:10.520
Dinner ho! Dinner ho!

21:10.600 --> 21:14.760
Dinner ho! Dinner ho!
Dinner ho! Dinner ho!

21:14.840 --> 21:17.240
Dinner ho! Dinner!

21:17.960 --> 21:20.800
Where's my knave, my fool? Eh?

21:21.520 --> 21:23.080
Go you and call my fool hither.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.400
Ah. You, sir, you.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.480
You! Sirrah, where's my daughter?

21:30.560 --> 21:31.960
So please you.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.560
What says the fellow there?
Call the clotpoll back.

21:35.280 --> 21:39.040
Where's my fool?
I think the world's asleep. Hm.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.120
By day and night he wrongs me.

21:41.200 --> 21:45.120
Every hour he flashes into one gross
crime or other that sets us all at odds.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.960
I'll not endure it.

21:47.040 --> 21:50.520
His knights grow riotous
and himself upbraids us on every trifle.

21:50.600 --> 21:51.920
Say I am sick.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.760
Put on what weary negligence you please.

21:55.840 --> 21:59.360
If he distaste it, let him to my sister,

21:59.440 --> 22:03.840
whose mind and mine I know
in that are one, not to be overruled.

22:04.800 --> 22:05.800
Well, madam.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.080
- Where's that mongrel?
- He says your daughter is not well.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.960
Why came not the slave back
when I called him?

22:12.040 --> 22:14.240
Sir, he answered me in the roundest
manner he would not.

22:14.320 --> 22:18.160
- He would not?
- Ooh…

22:19.680 --> 22:21.640
Go and tell my daughter
I would speak with her.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.080
- Go you, call hither my fool.
- Sir.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.800
O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir.

22:28.480 --> 22:29.480
Who am I, sir?

22:31.040 --> 22:33.320
- My lady's father.
- My lady's father?

22:33.400 --> 22:36.360
My lord's knave, you whoreson dog,
you slave, you cur.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.560
I am none of these, my lord,
I beseech your pardon.

22:38.640 --> 22:41.520
- Bandy looks with me, rascal?
- I'll not be struck, my lord.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.280
Nor tripped neither,
you base football player!

22:44.800 --> 22:47.840
I thank thee, fellow.
Thou servest me, and I'll love thee.

22:49.480 --> 22:53.480
Come, sir, arise, away. Up.
I'll teach you differences.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.000
Away, away.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.080
Let me hire him, too.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.200
- Here's my coxcomb.
- How now, my pretty knave?

23:12.280 --> 23:15.240
- How dost thou?
- Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.840
- Why, Fool?
- Why?

23:16.920 --> 23:19.200
This fellow has banished
two of his daughters

23:19.280 --> 23:22.240
and did the third a blessing
against his will.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.960
If thou follow him,
thou must needs wear my coxcomb.

23:26.640 --> 23:27.880
How now, nuncle?

23:27.960 --> 23:30.680
Would I had two coxcombs
and two daughters.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.320
Why, boy?

23:32.400 --> 23:36.720
If I gave them all my living
I'd keep my coxcombs myself.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.640
There's mine.
Beg another of thy daughters.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.600
Dost thou call me fool, boy? Eh?

23:43.960 --> 23:46.200
All thy other titles thou hast given
away.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.960
That thou wast born with.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.640
This is not altogether fool, my lord.

23:53.160 --> 23:56.560
<i>♪ Fools had ne'er ♪
♪ less grace in a year ♪</i>

23:56.640 --> 23:58.880
<i>♪ For wise men are grown foppish ♪</i>

23:58.960 --> 24:01.680
<i>♪ And know not how their wits to wear ♪</i>

24:01.760 --> 24:06.080
<i>♪ Their manners are so apish ♪</i>

24:08.320 --> 24:11.680
When were you wont
to be so full of songs, sirrah?

24:11.760 --> 24:15.120
I have used it, nuncle, e'er since
thou madest thy daughters thy mothers.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.040
Sirrah, we'll have you whipped.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.480
I marvel what kin
thou and thy daughters are.

24:21.240 --> 24:24.680
They'll have me whipped
for speaking true,

24:24.760 --> 24:26.600
thou'lt have me whipped for lying.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.600
And sometimes I am whipped
for holding my peace.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.320
I had rather be any kind of thing
than a fool.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.880
And yet I would not be thee, nuncle.

24:38.960 --> 24:43.680
Thou hast pared thy wit on both sides
and left nothing in the middle.

24:44.840 --> 24:47.240
Here comes one of the parings.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.640
Hm.

24:49.720 --> 24:53.360
How now, daughter?
What makes that frontlet on?

24:53.440 --> 24:56.280
Methinks you are too much of late
I' the frown.

24:56.360 --> 25:00.080
Not only, sir,
this your all-licensed fool,

25:00.800 --> 25:04.520
but other of your insolent retinue
do hourly carp and quarrel,

25:04.600 --> 25:08.080
breaking forth in rank
and not-to-be-endured riots.

25:10.560 --> 25:14.240
Sir, I had thought
by making this well known unto you

25:14.320 --> 25:16.360
to have found a safe redress

25:16.440 --> 25:20.000
but now grow fearful, by what yourself
too late have spoke and done,

25:20.080 --> 25:24.520
that you protect this course
and put it on by your allowance.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.800
Are you our daughter? Hm?

25:29.360 --> 25:31.400
I would you would make use
of your good wisdom

25:31.480 --> 25:33.520
whereof I know you are fraught

25:33.600 --> 25:35.320
and put away these dispositions

25:35.400 --> 25:38.400
which of late transport you
from what you rightly are.

25:38.840 --> 25:42.600
May not an ass know
when the cart draws the horse?

25:44.600 --> 25:46.200
Whoop, Jug, I love thee!

25:46.280 --> 25:47.840
Does any here know me?

25:48.600 --> 25:49.680
This is not Lear.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.600
Does Lear walk thus? Speak thus?

25:53.320 --> 25:55.080
Where are his eyes?

25:55.160 --> 25:58.600
Either his notion weakens,
or his discernings are lethargied.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.320
Ha, waking?

26:00.400 --> 26:01.560
'Tis not so.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.400
Who is it that can tell me who I am?

26:08.120 --> 26:09.200
Lear's shadow.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.840
Your name, fair gentlewoman?

26:16.920 --> 26:18.560
Huh?

26:18.640 --> 26:22.160
This admiration, sir, is much o'th'savour
of other your new pranks.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.680
I do beseech you
to understand my purposes aright.

26:26.520 --> 26:30.400
As you are old and reverend,
should be wise.

26:31.160 --> 26:34.400
Here do you keep
a hundred knights and squires,

26:34.480 --> 26:37.120
men so disordered, so debauched and
bold

26:37.200 --> 26:42.280
that this our court, infected with
their manners, shows like a riotous inn.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.560
Oh…

26:48.200 --> 26:52.560
Be then desired by her
that else will take the thing she begs

26:53.240 --> 26:55.520
a little to disquantity your train.

26:55.920 --> 26:59.520
Darkness and devils!
Call my train together.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.480
Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble
thee.

27:02.560 --> 27:03.720
Yet have I left a daughter.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.960
You strike my people and your rabble
make servants of their betters.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.520
Woe that too late repents!

27:10.440 --> 27:12.080
O, you, sir, you, are you come?

27:12.160 --> 27:14.280
Is it your will? Speak, sir.

27:14.360 --> 27:17.880
- Pray, sir, be patient.
- O most small fault,

27:17.960 --> 27:20.680
how ugly didst thou in Cordelia show,

27:20.760 --> 27:23.680
which, like an engine, wrenched
my frame of nature from the fixed place,

27:23.760 --> 27:26.640
drew from my heart all love,

27:28.920 --> 27:31.040
and added to the gall.

27:32.520 --> 27:36.000
O Lear, Lear, Lear!
Beat at this gate that let thy folly in

27:36.080 --> 27:37.720
and thy dear judgement out.

27:37.800 --> 27:38.880
Go, go, my people!

27:42.320 --> 27:47.120
My lord, I am guiltless
as I am ignorant of what hath moved you.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.240
It may be so, my lord.

27:55.560 --> 27:58.640
Hear, Nature, hear, dear goddess, hear!

27:58.720 --> 28:03.240
Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend
to make this creature fruitful.

28:03.320 --> 28:06.720
Into her womb convey sterility!

28:08.040 --> 28:10.760
Dry up in her the organs of increase,

28:10.840 --> 28:14.000
and from her derogate body
never spring a babe to honour her.

28:14.080 --> 28:18.160
If she must teem,
create her child of spleen,

28:18.240 --> 28:21.520
that it may live
and be a thwart disnatured torment to her.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.720
Let it stamp wrinkles
in her brow of youth,

28:24.800 --> 28:28.200
that she may feel
how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is

28:28.280 --> 28:30.800
to have a thankless child.

28:34.320 --> 28:35.920
Away, away!

28:38.960 --> 28:41.080
Now, gods that we adore,
whereof comes this?

28:41.160 --> 28:43.560
Never afflict yourself to know more of it,

28:43.640 --> 28:47.920
but let his disposition

28:48.000 --> 28:51.040
have that scope as dotage gives it.

28:51.440 --> 28:52.600
O you, you, sirrah!

28:58.600 --> 29:02.840
What, fifty of my followers at a clap,
within a fortnight?

29:02.920 --> 29:04.760
- What's the matter, sir?
- I'll tell thee!

29:04.840 --> 29:09.680
Life and death! I am ashamed that thou
hast power to shake my manhood thus.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.680
Blasts and fogs upon thee!

29:12.760 --> 29:17.640
The untented woundings of a father's
curse pierce every sense about thee!

29:18.320 --> 29:22.120
Let it be so. Yet have I left
a daughter…

29:22.200 --> 29:25.040
…who, I am sure,
is kind and comfortable.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.200
When she shall hear this of
thee,

29:27.280 --> 29:30.400
with her nails
she'll flay thy wolvish visage.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.440
Thou shalt find that I'll resume the
shape

29:35.520 --> 29:39.040
which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.560
Thou shalt, I warrant thee.

29:45.680 --> 29:46.960
Away, away.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.760
Do you mark that?

29:52.360 --> 29:55.320
I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
to the great love I bear you…

29:55.400 --> 29:56.960
Pray you, content.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.520
Oswald!

29:58.600 --> 30:03.280
You, sir, more knave than fool,
after your master!

30:03.360 --> 30:06.000
Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry.

30:06.080 --> 30:09.880
- A hundred knights?
- Take the fool with thee!

30:09.960 --> 30:15.120
'Tis politic and safe to let him
keep at point a hundred knights!

30:15.200 --> 30:20.720
Yes, that on every dream, each buzz,
each fancy, each complaint, dislike,

30:20.800 --> 30:26.560
he may enguard his dotage with
their powers and hold our lives in mercy.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.320
Oswald, I say!

30:28.400 --> 30:30.640
Well, you may fear too far.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.440
Safer than trust too far.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.520
I know his heart.

30:36.680 --> 30:39.920
What he hath uttered
I have writ my sister.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.680
If she sustain him and his hundred
knights

30:43.160 --> 30:44.680
when I have showed th'unfitness…

30:45.920 --> 30:49.440
Oswald, away to my sister.
Inform her full of my particular fear,

30:49.520 --> 30:53.640
and thereto add such reasons of your own
as may compact it more.

30:53.720 --> 30:56.480
Get you gone, and hasten your return.

31:01.840 --> 31:06.400
If a man's brains were in's heels,
were't not in danger of chilblains?

31:07.200 --> 31:08.680
Ay, boy.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.640
Then, I prithee, be merry.

31:11.320 --> 31:14.680
Thy wit shall not go slipshod. Oy oy!

31:18.120 --> 31:21.600
Thou canst tell why one's nose
stands in the middle of one's face?

31:21.680 --> 31:22.680
No.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.760
Why, to keep one's eyes
of either side's nose…

31:24.840 --> 31:25.880
Ah…

31:25.960 --> 31:29.760
…that what a man cannot smell out,
he may spy into.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.720
Oy oy!

31:34.520 --> 31:35.920
I did her wrong.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.200
Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?

31:40.840 --> 31:41.840
No.

31:42.520 --> 31:43.840
Nor I neither.

31:44.800 --> 31:46.800
But I can tell why a snail has a house.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.960
- Why?
- Why, to put's head in.

31:51.080 --> 31:54.440
Not to give it away to his daughters
and leave his horns without a case.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.320
I will forget my nature.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.040
I'm so kind a father.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.160
The reason why the seven stars

32:07.240 --> 32:09.680
are no more
than seven is a pretty reason.

32:10.520 --> 32:14.000
- Because they are not eight.
- Yes, indeed.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.760
Thou wouldst make a good fool.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.720
Monster ingratitude.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.000
If thou wert my fool, nuncle,

32:24.080 --> 32:27.440
I'd have thee beaten
for being old before thy time.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.680
How's that?

32:31.160 --> 32:34.880
Thou shouldst not have been old
till thou hadst been wise.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.760
O, let me not be mad.

32:39.880 --> 32:41.920
Not mad, sweet heavens.

32:43.280 --> 32:44.800
Keep me in temper.

32:46.320 --> 32:48.240
I would not be mad.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.280
Ready, my lord.

32:51.280 --> 32:52.600
Come, boy.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.280
Brother, a word.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.000
Ascend, brother, I say.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.120
O sir, fly this place.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.000
Intelligence is given where you are hid.

33:37.080 --> 33:40.040
The Duke of Cornwall's coming hither now,
in haste and Regan with him.

33:40.120 --> 33:42.560
- Have you nothing said upon his party?
- I am sure of it…

33:42.640 --> 33:44.080
- Sh…
- Not a word.

33:44.160 --> 33:46.280
Find out this villain.
Go seek him.

33:46.360 --> 33:47.800
I hear my father coming.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.400
Help! Help!

34:00.040 --> 34:02.080
Fly, brother! Fly!

34:05.920 --> 34:06.920
Help!

34:08.239 --> 34:10.120
Help!

34:11.840 --> 34:14.159
I've seen drunkards
do more than this in sport.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.520
Help!

34:23.840 --> 34:26.040
Help!

34:26.120 --> 34:27.920
Take your positions!

34:28.000 --> 34:30.560
- Where is the villain?
- Here stood he in the dark,

34:30.639 --> 34:34.360
mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring
the moon to stand auspicious mistress.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.120
- But where is he?
- Look, sir, I bleed.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.520
Where is the villain, Edmund?

34:37.600 --> 34:39.679
Fled this way, sir,
when by no means he could…

34:39.760 --> 34:41.679
Pursue him! Ho! Go after!

34:42.400 --> 34:43.480
"By no means" what?

34:43.560 --> 34:46.080
Persuade me to the murder
of your lordship.

34:46.159 --> 34:50.040
Not in this land shall he remain
uncaught, and found, dispatch.

34:50.760 --> 34:54.440
It is the duke. All ports I'll bar,
the duke must grant me that.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.120
The villain shall not 'scape.

34:57.120 --> 35:00.800
And of my land, loyal and natural boy,

35:00.880 --> 35:03.280
I'll work the means to make thee
capable.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.560
How dost, my lord?

35:12.640 --> 35:14.680
O madam, my old heart is cracked,
'tis cracked.

35:14.760 --> 35:17.400
What, did my father's godson
seek your life?

35:17.480 --> 35:20.040
O lady, lady, shame would have it hid.

35:20.120 --> 35:23.080
Was he not companion with the riotous
knights that tended upon my father?

35:23.160 --> 35:26.240
- I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad.
- Yes, madam, he was of that consort.

35:26.320 --> 35:29.080
Oh, no marvel then
though he were ill affected.

35:29.160 --> 35:32.280
I have this present evening from my
sister

35:32.360 --> 35:35.200
been well informed of them
and with such cautions

35:35.280 --> 35:38.280
that if they come to sojourn at my house,
I'll not be there.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.440
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.000
Edmund, I hear you have shown
your father a child-like office.

35:43.080 --> 35:44.840
It was my duty, sir.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.680
He received this hurt you see,
striving to apprehend him.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.160
- Is he pursued?
- Ay, my good lord.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.760
If he be taken, he shall
never more be feared of doing harm.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.080
For you, Edmund,

35:55.160 --> 35:59.680
natures of such deep trust
we shall much need. You we first seize on.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.600
I shall serve you, sir, truly,
however else.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.040
For him I thank your grace.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.080
You know not why we came to visit you.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.880
Thus out of season,
threading dark-eyed night,

36:07.960 --> 36:10.280
occasions, noble Gloucester,
of some prize,

36:10.360 --> 36:12.560
wherein we must have use of your advice.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.080
They've got the scent!

36:15.160 --> 36:16.400
Go on, find him!

36:20.080 --> 36:22.480
Forwards! Keep moving forwards!

37:03.480 --> 37:06.000
- Art of this house, friend?
- Ay.

37:06.080 --> 37:08.800
- Where may we stop?
- In the mire.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.960
I prithee,
if thou lovest me, tell me.

37:12.040 --> 37:14.720
- I love thee not.
- Why, then I care not for thee.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.840
If I had thee in a ring
I'd make thee care for me.

37:17.920 --> 37:19.760
Why dost thou use me thus?
I know thee not.

37:19.840 --> 37:22.800
- Fellow, I know thee.
- What dost thou know me for?

37:22.880 --> 37:25.600
A knave, a rascal,

37:25.680 --> 37:28.760
a base, proud, shallow, beggarly,

37:28.840 --> 37:34.320
three-suited, hundred-pound,
filthy worsted-stocking knave.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.760
Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou,
thus to rail on one

37:36.840 --> 37:38.680
that neither knows thee
nor is known of thee.

37:38.760 --> 37:42.800
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou
to deny thou knowest me.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.360
I tripped up thy heels
and beat thee before the king.

37:45.440 --> 37:47.880
I'll make a sop of the moonlight of you,
you whoreson.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.680
Away! I have nothing to do with thee.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.560
You rascal!

37:51.640 --> 37:55.960
You take the puppet's part against
the royalty of her father, you rogue.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.560
Help! Murder! Help!

37:58.640 --> 38:01.960
Stand, you rogue! Stand, you slave!

38:02.040 --> 38:03.440
Help!

38:04.160 --> 38:06.400
- Help! Help!
- How now, what's the matter?

38:07.920 --> 38:10.160
With you, goodman boy!

38:10.240 --> 38:13.240
If you please come, I'll beat ye.
Come on, young master!

38:13.320 --> 38:15.520
- What's the matter here?
- Peace, upon your lives!

38:15.920 --> 38:17.920
He dies that strikes again!

38:18.000 --> 38:19.440
What is the matter?

38:19.520 --> 38:21.280
The messenger from our sister
and the king.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.160
What is your difference?
Speak.

38:23.240 --> 38:27.160
Sir, this ancient ruffian,
whose life I have spared…

38:27.240 --> 38:29.760
You whoreson zed,
you unnecessary letter…

38:29.840 --> 38:32.320
Peace, sirrah!
Know you no reverence?

38:32.400 --> 38:35.720
- Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.
- Why art thou angry?

38:35.800 --> 38:39.560
That such a slave as this should
walk the world, who wears no honesty.

38:39.640 --> 38:43.160
- What is his fault?
- His countenance likes me not.

38:43.240 --> 38:46.520
No more perchance does mine, nor his,

38:46.600 --> 38:47.760
nor hers.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.560
I have seen better faces in my time

38:51.640 --> 38:55.800
than stands on any shoulder
that I see before me at this instant.

38:57.320 --> 38:59.440
You stubborn, ancient knave.

39:03.280 --> 39:04.360
We'll teach you.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.200
I serve the king!

39:07.080 --> 39:12.160
As I have life and honour,
here shall he stay until… noon?

39:12.240 --> 39:13.280
Till noon?

39:13.360 --> 39:14.920
Till tomorrow night, my lord.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.800
Why, madam, if I was your father's dog,
you should not use me so.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.720
Sir, being his knave, I will.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.400
This is a fellow of the selfsame colour
our sister speaks of.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.440
The king his master needs must take it ill

39:25.520 --> 39:27.920
that he, so slightly valued
in his messenger,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.480
should have him thus restrained.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.240
I'll answer that.

39:34.320 --> 39:39.520
My sister may receive it much more worse
to have her gentleman abused, assaulted.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.240
- Come, away.
- Dismissed!

39:45.240 --> 39:47.960
I'm sorry for thee, friend.
I'll entreat for thee.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.600
Pray do not, sir.

39:49.680 --> 39:53.000
The duke's to blame in this.
'Twill be ill taken.

40:40.760 --> 40:44.680
I heard myself proclaimed.

40:46.160 --> 40:47.600
Edgar!

40:52.280 --> 40:53.720
Edgar…

40:56.840 --> 40:59.520
I… nothing…

41:02.440 --> 41:03.920
am.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.520
He wears cruel garters.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.960
Hail to thee, noble master.

41:45.880 --> 41:49.560
What's he that hath so much
thy place mistook to set thee here?

41:49.640 --> 41:52.720
It is both he and she,
your son and daughter.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.480
- No.
- Yes.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.520
- No, I say.
- I say, yea.

41:56.600 --> 42:00.040
- By Jupiter, I swear no.
- By Juno, I swear ay.

42:01.160 --> 42:05.320
Where is this daughter?
Give me my servant forth!

42:06.440 --> 42:08.520
Deny to speak with me?

42:09.080 --> 42:13.760
They are sick? They are weary?
They have travelled all the night?

42:13.840 --> 42:16.200
Ha! Mere fetches.

42:17.320 --> 42:19.760
The images of revolt and flying off.

42:20.480 --> 42:22.000
Fetch me a better answer.

42:22.720 --> 42:27.080
Go tell the duke and his wife
I'd speak with them, now, presently.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.760
Bid them come forth and hear me,

42:28.840 --> 42:32.840
or at their chamber door I'll beat
the drum till it cry sleep to death.

42:33.680 --> 42:35.800
I would have all well betwixt you.

42:35.880 --> 42:38.280
O me, my heart, my rising heart…
But down…

42:38.360 --> 42:39.800
Cry to it, nuncle,

42:39.880 --> 42:43.040
as the cockney did to the eels
when she put 'em in the paste alive.

42:43.120 --> 42:46.120
She knapped 'em on their coxcombs
with a stick and cried,

42:46.200 --> 42:47.760
"Down, wantons, down!"

42:52.600 --> 42:54.160
Oh, good morrow to you both.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.360
Hail to your grace.

42:56.440 --> 43:01.080
- I am glad to see your highness.
- Regan. I think you are.

43:01.160 --> 43:03.400
I have good reason to think so.

43:07.160 --> 43:09.160
Oh, are you free?

43:17.480 --> 43:19.360
Thy sister's naught.

43:19.440 --> 43:22.880
O Regan, she hath tied sharp-toothed
unkindness like a vulture here.

43:22.960 --> 43:24.120
I can scarce speak to thee.

43:24.200 --> 43:27.120
Thou'lt not believe
with how depraved a quality…

43:27.200 --> 43:30.440
- O Regan!
- I pray you, sir, take patience.

43:31.400 --> 43:35.960
I have hope you less know
how to value her desert

43:36.040 --> 43:37.640
than she to scant her duty.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.400
Say, how is that?

43:39.960 --> 43:43.840
I cannot think my sister in the least
should fail her obligation.

43:43.920 --> 43:49.000
If, sir, perchance she hath restrained
the riots of your followers,

43:49.080 --> 43:53.560
'tis on such ground and to such wholesome
end as clears her from all blame.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.480
My curses on her.

43:56.280 --> 43:59.800
O sir, you are old.

43:59.880 --> 44:04.800
Nature in you stands
on the very verge of her confine.

44:05.840 --> 44:08.400
You should be ruled and led

44:08.480 --> 44:13.240
by some discretion that discerns
your state better than you yourself.

44:13.760 --> 44:18.560
Therefore I pray you
that to our sister you do make return.

44:18.640 --> 44:19.920
Say you have wronged her.

44:20.560 --> 44:21.960
Ask her forgiveness?

44:25.080 --> 44:27.320
Do you but mark
how this becomes the house?

44:27.400 --> 44:30.200
"Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.
Age is unnecessary."

44:30.280 --> 44:33.720
"On my knees I beg that you'll
vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food."

44:33.800 --> 44:35.760
Sir, these are unsightly tricks.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.680
Return you to my sister.

44:37.760 --> 44:38.960
Never, Regan!

44:39.680 --> 44:42.560
She hath abated me of half my train,
looked black upon me,

44:42.640 --> 44:46.040
struck me with her tongue
most serpent-like upon the very heart.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.720
All the stored vengeances of heaven

44:48.800 --> 44:50.640
- fall on her ingrateful top!
- Fie, sir, fie.

44:50.720 --> 44:53.880
Strike her young bones,
you taking airs, with lameness!

44:55.000 --> 44:56.560
Ah…

44:56.640 --> 45:00.640
You nimble lightnings, dart your
blinding flames into her scornful eyes!

45:00.720 --> 45:04.920
Infect her beauty, you fen-sucked fogs
drawn by the powerful sun,

45:05.000 --> 45:07.080
to fall and blister!

45:07.160 --> 45:10.360
O the blest gods, so will you wish on me
when the rash mood is on.

45:10.440 --> 45:13.360
No, Regan, thou shalt never have my
curse.

45:15.760 --> 45:18.880
Thy tender-hefted nature
shall not give thee o'er to harshness.

45:18.960 --> 45:22.440
Her eyes are fierce,
but thine do comfort and not burn.

45:23.840 --> 45:26.160
Thou better knowest the offices of
nature,

45:26.240 --> 45:30.440
bond of childhood, effects of courtesy,
dues of gratitude.

45:30.520 --> 45:36.240
Thy half of the kingdom hast thou
not forgot, wherein I thee endowed.

45:37.840 --> 45:39.480
Good sir, to the purpose.

45:42.200 --> 45:44.680
Who put my man I' the stocks?

45:51.480 --> 45:52.720
- Is your lady come?
- I…

45:52.800 --> 45:55.320
This is the slave
whose easy, borrowed pride

45:55.400 --> 45:57.360
dwells in the fickle grace
of her he follows.

45:57.440 --> 45:59.680
- Out, varlet, from my sight!
- What means your grace?

46:00.360 --> 46:02.080
Who stocked my servant?

46:02.160 --> 46:04.520
Regan, I have good hope
thou didst not know on it.

46:04.600 --> 46:05.640
Who comes here?

46:07.400 --> 46:09.400
O heavens!

46:10.800 --> 46:14.280
If you do love old men,
if your sweet sway allow obedience,

46:14.360 --> 46:17.120
if you yourselves are old,
make it your cause.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.920
Send down and take my part.

46:19.920 --> 46:22.480
Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?

46:24.240 --> 46:26.520
O Regan, will you take her by the hand?

46:26.600 --> 46:30.640
Why not by the hand, sir?
How have I offended?

46:30.720 --> 46:34.640
All's not offence that indiscretion finds
and dotage terms so.

46:34.720 --> 46:38.560
O sides, you are too tough.
Will you yet hold?

46:39.520 --> 46:41.400
How came my man I' the stocks?

46:41.480 --> 46:43.000
I set him there, sir!

46:43.080 --> 46:44.520
You? Did you?

46:45.960 --> 46:49.120
I pray you, Father, being weak, seem so.

46:51.520 --> 46:53.120
If till the expiration of your month

46:53.200 --> 46:57.160
you will return and sojourn with
my sister, dismissing half your train,

46:57.240 --> 46:59.120
come then to me.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.840
I am now from home

47:00.920 --> 47:04.760
and out of that provision which shall be
needful for your entertainment.

47:05.480 --> 47:09.720
Return to her and fifty men dismissed? No!

47:10.080 --> 47:14.080
Persuade me rather to be slave
and sumpter to that detested groom.

47:14.160 --> 47:15.880
At your choice, sir.

47:16.600 --> 47:19.080
I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.

47:19.160 --> 47:21.280
I will not trouble thee, my child.
Farewell.

47:22.040 --> 47:23.960
We'll no more meet,
no more see one another.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.040
Oh!

47:35.880 --> 47:39.360
But yet thou art my flesh,
my blood, my daughter.

47:40.960 --> 47:46.760
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
which I must needs call mine.

47:48.080 --> 47:50.360
Thou art a boil, a plague sore,

47:50.440 --> 47:53.800
an embossed carbuncle
in my corrupted blood.

47:55.920 --> 47:57.480
But I'll not chide thee.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.880
Let shame come when it will,
I do not call it.

48:02.960 --> 48:07.320
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot, nor
tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.

48:07.840 --> 48:09.560
Mend when thou canst.

48:10.520 --> 48:12.360
Be better at thy leisure.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.800
I can be patient.

48:14.880 --> 48:20.120
I can stay with Regan,
I and my hundred knights.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.520
Not altogether so.

48:25.040 --> 48:29.280
I looked not for you yet,
nor am provided for your fit welcome.

48:30.640 --> 48:32.520
Give ear, sir, to my sister.

48:33.680 --> 48:36.560
For those that mingle reason
with your passion

48:37.240 --> 48:39.720
must be content to think you old and
so…

48:39.800 --> 48:41.760
But she knows what she does.

48:43.480 --> 48:46.520
- Is this well spoken?
- I dare avouch it, sir.

48:47.320 --> 48:51.520
What, fifty followers? Is it not well?

48:51.600 --> 48:54.040
What should you need of more,
yea, or so many,

48:54.120 --> 48:57.120
sith that both charge and danger
speak 'gainst so great a number?

48:57.200 --> 49:01.120
How in one house may many people
under two commands hold amity?

49:01.200 --> 49:02.680
'Tis hard, almost impossible.

49:02.760 --> 49:04.640
Why might not you, my lord,

49:04.720 --> 49:08.280
receive attendance from those
that she calls servants or from mine?

49:08.360 --> 49:12.120
Why not, my lord? I do entreat you
to bring but five-and-twenty.

49:13.080 --> 49:15.200
To no more will I give place or notice.

49:16.280 --> 49:17.920
I gave you all…

49:18.600 --> 49:20.760
And in good time you gave it.

49:21.960 --> 49:24.200
Made you my guardians, my depositories.

49:24.280 --> 49:29.600
What? Must I come to you with
five-and-twenty? Regan, said you so?

49:29.680 --> 49:32.600
And speak it again, my lord.
No more with me.

49:35.960 --> 49:36.960
Ah…

49:37.680 --> 49:38.680
Ha!

49:40.320 --> 49:41.920
I'll go with thee.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.120
Thy fifty yet doth double
five-and-twenty,

49:44.200 --> 49:45.560
and thou art twice her love.

49:46.200 --> 49:48.040
Hear me, my lord.

49:48.120 --> 49:52.440
What need you five-and-twenty,
ten, or five to follow

49:52.520 --> 49:56.760
in a house where twice so many
have a command to tend you?

49:56.840 --> 50:00.040
- What need one?
- Reason not the need.

50:01.960 --> 50:05.960
Our basest beggars
are in the poorest thing superfluous.

50:06.040 --> 50:11.480
Allow not nature more than nature needs,
man's life is cheap as beast's.

50:12.320 --> 50:13.680
Thou art a lady.

50:15.520 --> 50:17.320
If only to go warm were gorgeous,

50:17.400 --> 50:20.760
why, nature needs not
what thou gorgeous wear'st,

50:20.840 --> 50:23.400
which scarcely keeps thee warm.

50:32.760 --> 50:35.920
But for true need…

50:36.000 --> 50:39.800
You heavens, give me that patience,

50:39.880 --> 50:41.720
patience I need!

50:41.880 --> 50:46.480
You see me here, you gods, a poor
old man, as full of grief as age,

50:46.560 --> 50:47.880
wretched in both.

50:47.960 --> 50:51.960
If it could be you that stir these
daughters' hearts against their father,

50:52.040 --> 50:54.880
fool me not so much to bear it tamely.

50:55.800 --> 50:58.320
Touch me with noble anger

50:58.400 --> 51:02.400
and let not women's weapons, water-
drops,

51:02.480 --> 51:04.840
stain my man's cheeks.

51:05.960 --> 51:08.400
No, you unnatural hags!

51:10.680 --> 51:14.680
I will have such revenges on you both
that all the world shall…

51:14.760 --> 51:16.200
I will do such things.

51:16.280 --> 51:21.000
What they are yet I know not,
but they shall be…

51:22.360 --> 51:25.040
the terrors of the earth!

51:27.400 --> 51:29.440
You think I'll weep.

51:30.480 --> 51:34.520
No… I'll not weep!

51:37.720 --> 51:40.320
I have full cause of weeping

51:40.400 --> 51:44.560
but this heart shall break
into a hundred thousand flaws

51:44.640 --> 51:46.280
or ere I'll weep.

51:50.800 --> 51:53.440
O Fool…

51:56.120 --> 51:58.000
I shall go mad.

52:17.920 --> 52:19.280
'Twill be a storm.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.880
The old man and his people
cannot be well bestowed here.

52:21.960 --> 52:25.120
'Tis his own blame hath put himself
from rest,

52:25.200 --> 52:27.360
and must needs taste his folly.

52:27.440 --> 52:30.080
For his particular I'll receive him
gladly, but not one follower.

52:30.160 --> 52:32.080
So am I purposed.
Where is my Lord of Gloucester?

52:32.160 --> 52:34.720
Followed the old man forth.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.040
The king is in high rage.

52:36.120 --> 52:37.680
- Whither is he going?
- I know not.

52:37.760 --> 52:39.600
'Tis best to give him way.
He leads himself.

52:39.680 --> 52:42.240
My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.

52:42.320 --> 52:44.360
Alack, the high winds do sorely ruffle.

52:44.440 --> 52:46.560
For many miles about
there's scarce a bush.

52:46.640 --> 52:50.120
O sir, to wilful men
the injuries that they themselves procure

52:50.200 --> 52:52.240
must be their schoolmasters.
Shut up your doors.

52:52.320 --> 52:53.480
Shut up your doors, my lord.

52:54.120 --> 52:56.800
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!

52:56.880 --> 53:00.320
Rage, blow, you cataracts and
hurricanoes,

53:00.400 --> 53:04.480
spout till you have drenched our
steeples, drown'd the cocks!

53:04.560 --> 53:07.960
You sulphurous
and thought-executing fires,

53:08.040 --> 53:12.280
vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving
thunderbolts, singe my white head!

53:12.360 --> 53:15.400
And thou, all-shaking thunder,

53:15.480 --> 53:18.160
strike flat the thick rotundity
o'th'world,

53:18.240 --> 53:19.920
crack nature's moulds,

53:20.000 --> 53:24.520
all germens spill at once
that make ingrateful man.

53:24.600 --> 53:27.120
Good nuncle, in!

53:27.200 --> 53:28.880
Ask thy daughters' blessing.

53:28.960 --> 53:32.480
Rumble thy bellyful!
Spit, fire! Spout, rain!

53:32.560 --> 53:36.480
I tax not you, you elements,
with unkindness.

53:36.560 --> 53:39.000
Then let fall your horrible pleasure.

53:39.080 --> 53:41.880
Here I stand, your slave,

53:41.960 --> 53:46.240
a poor, infirm,
weak and despised old man.

53:46.320 --> 53:49.480
He that has a house to put his head in

53:49.560 --> 53:50.800
has a good headpiece.

53:51.360 --> 53:54.280
Alas, sir, are you here?

53:54.360 --> 53:57.480
Let the great gods that keep
this dreadful pudder o'er our heads

53:57.560 --> 53:59.280
find out their enemies now.

53:59.360 --> 54:02.040
I am a man more sinned against
than sinning.

54:02.120 --> 54:04.880
Gracious my lord, hard by here is a
hovel.

54:04.960 --> 54:07.520
Some friendship will it lend you
'gainst the tempest.

54:09.240 --> 54:11.120
My wits begin to turn.

54:12.240 --> 54:14.120
Come on, my boy. How dost, my
boy?

54:14.200 --> 54:16.520
Art cold? I am cold myself.

54:16.600 --> 54:19.160
Come, your hovel. Poor fool and knave,

54:19.240 --> 54:23.480
I have one part in my heart
that's sorry yet for thee.

54:24.320 --> 54:27.080
<i>♪ He that has ♪
♪ and a little tiny wit ♪</i>

54:27.160 --> 54:30.600
<i>♪ With a hey ho, the wind and the rain ♪</i>

54:30.680 --> 54:33.520
<i>♪ Must make content with his fortunes fit ♪</i>

54:33.600 --> 54:37.240
<i>♪ Though the rain it raineth every day ♪</i>

54:39.560 --> 54:41.960
I like not
this unnatural dealing.

54:42.040 --> 54:44.920
They have taken from me
the use of mine own house,

54:45.000 --> 54:47.240
charged me
on pain of perpetual displeasure

54:47.320 --> 54:50.880
neither to speak of him,
entreat for him or any way sustain him.

54:50.960 --> 54:52.280
Most savage and unnatural!

54:52.360 --> 54:53.920
Go to.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.520
Say you nothing.

54:56.640 --> 55:00.800
I have received a letter this night.
'Tis dangerous to be spoken.

55:01.800 --> 55:05.480
These injuries the king now bears
will be revenged.

55:05.560 --> 55:08.760
There is part of a power from France
already footed.

55:10.040 --> 55:13.800
We must incline to the king.
I will look for him.

55:13.880 --> 55:17.920
Go you and maintain talk with the duke,
that my charity be not of him perceived.

55:19.280 --> 55:22.200
If he ask for me,
I'm ill and gone to bed.

55:24.200 --> 55:28.840
If I die for it,
as no less is threatened me,

55:28.920 --> 55:32.000
the king, my old master, must be
relieved.

55:33.640 --> 55:35.880
Pray you, be careful.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.920
Here is the place, my lord.

55:40.960 --> 55:43.840
Good my lord, enter.

55:43.920 --> 55:47.520
The tyranny of the open night's too rough
for nature to endure.

55:49.520 --> 55:52.600
- Let me alone.
- Good my lord, enter here.

55:52.680 --> 55:55.400
Prithee, go in thyself,
seek thine own ease.

55:55.480 --> 55:58.960
This tempest will not give me leave
to ponder on things would hurt me more.

55:59.040 --> 56:01.800
But I'll go in. In, boy, go first.

56:02.480 --> 56:05.720
I'll pray. Then I'll sleep.

56:20.280 --> 56:25.520
Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you
are,

56:25.600 --> 56:28.240
that bide the pelting
of this pitiless storm,

56:30.400 --> 56:35.520
how shall your houseless heads,
your unfed sides,

56:35.600 --> 56:41.600
your looped and windowed raggedness
defend you from seasons such as these?

56:44.360 --> 56:48.000
O, I have ta'en too little care of this.

56:50.320 --> 56:52.240
Take physic, pomp!

56:52.320 --> 56:56.080
Expose thyself to feel what wretches
feel.

56:58.360 --> 57:00.440
Help, help, help me!

57:00.520 --> 57:01.960
A spirit! A spirit!

57:02.040 --> 57:03.560
What?

57:04.400 --> 57:07.360
- What art thou that dost grumble there?
- Oh…

57:07.440 --> 57:09.360
Come forth!

57:09.440 --> 57:10.440
Away!

57:11.240 --> 57:13.640
The foul fiend follows me!

57:13.720 --> 57:16.320
Go to thy bed and warm thee.

57:16.480 --> 57:19.400
Didst thou give all to thy daughters
and art thou come to this?

57:19.480 --> 57:22.640
- He hath no daughters, sir.
- Poor Tom!

57:22.720 --> 57:23.840
Death, traitor!

57:23.920 --> 57:27.800
Nothing could have subdued nature to
such a lowness but his unkind daughters.

57:28.320 --> 57:30.920
Bless thy five wits!

57:31.000 --> 57:33.320
Tom's… a-cold.

57:33.400 --> 57:34.960
What hast thou been?

57:35.040 --> 57:39.360
A servingman, proud in heart and mind,

57:39.440 --> 57:43.320
who curled my hair, wore gloves in my cap,

57:43.400 --> 57:46.280
served the lust of my mistress's heart

57:46.360 --> 57:49.320
and did the act of darkness with her…

57:49.400 --> 57:52.160
…in the sweet face of heaven.

57:52.240 --> 57:55.440
Dolphin, my boy, boy, sessa!

57:56.680 --> 57:59.640
Is man no more than this?

57:59.720 --> 58:02.280
Here's three on's are sophisticated.

58:02.360 --> 58:03.920
Thou art the thing itself.

58:04.000 --> 58:09.080
Unaccommodated man is no more
but such a poor, bare, forked animal

58:09.160 --> 58:10.720
as thou art. Ha!

58:10.800 --> 58:13.400
Off, off, you lendings.
Come, unbutton here.

58:13.480 --> 58:16.320
Prithee, nuncle, be contented.

58:16.400 --> 58:19.520
'Tis a naughty night to swim in.

58:21.680 --> 58:24.440
Look, here comes a walking fire!

58:25.120 --> 58:26.680
How fares your grace?

58:26.760 --> 58:29.680
Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog…

58:29.920 --> 58:32.120
Hath your grace no better company?

58:32.720 --> 58:36.720
The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman!
Tom's a-cold…

58:36.800 --> 58:38.480
Come with me.

58:38.560 --> 58:40.560
I have ventured to come seek you out

58:40.640 --> 58:43.240
and bring you where
both fire and food is ready.

58:43.320 --> 58:45.680
First let me talk a word
with this philosopher.

58:45.760 --> 58:47.040
Good my lord…

58:47.120 --> 58:48.800
What is the cause of thunder?

58:48.880 --> 58:51.600
Good my lord, take his offer,
go to the house!

58:52.040 --> 58:55.080
- I do beseech your grace…
- Cry you mercy, sir.

58:55.160 --> 58:58.960
- Come, noble philosopher, your company.
- Tom's a-cold.

58:59.040 --> 59:01.080
In, fellow, there.
Keep thee warm.

59:01.960 --> 59:04.000
No, no, no. This way, my lord.

59:04.080 --> 59:08.760
With him. I will keep company with
my philosopher. Come, good Athenian.

59:08.840 --> 59:11.600
O, soothe him, good my lord.
Let him take the fellow on.

59:11.680 --> 59:12.800
Take him you on.

59:12.880 --> 59:15.240
Come, good sir, good Athenian.

59:15.320 --> 59:19.680
Fee, fie, fo and fum,
I smell the blood of a British man.

59:19.760 --> 59:21.800
No words, no words, hush!

59:21.880 --> 59:23.680
This is the letter which he spoke of,

59:23.760 --> 59:27.720
which approves him an intelligent party
to the advantages of France.

59:30.920 --> 59:32.600
Come with me to my wife.

59:37.960 --> 59:41.080
If the matter of this paper be certain,
you have mighty business at hand.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.720
True or false,
it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester.

59:43.800 --> 59:44.920
Seek out where thy father is,

59:45.000 --> 59:46.720
that he may be ready
for our apprehension.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.680
Here is better than the open air,
take it thankfully.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.440
I will piece out the comfort
with what addition I can.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.680
I will not be long from you.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:16.400
The gods reward you for your kindness.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:30.680
Prithee, nuncle,
tell me whether a madman

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.800
be a gentleman or a yeoman.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.560
A king, a king!

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:42.760
He's mad that trusts in the tameness
of a wolf, a horse's health,

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.680
a boy's love, or a whore's oath.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.520
It shall be done.
I will arraign them straight!

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.240
Come, sit thou here,
most learned justicer.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.360
Sit thou there, sapient sir. Sit!

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:06.560
And now, you she foxes…

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.320
How do you, sir?

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.640
Stand you not so amazed.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.520
Will you lie down
and rest upon the cushions?

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.960
I'll see their trial first.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.400
Bring their evidence.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.120
Thou robed man of justice, take thy
place.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.360
And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,
bench by his side.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.000
You are of the commission, sit you, too.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.440
Let us deal justly.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.120
Mm.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.400
Arraign her first.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.320
'Tis Goneril.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.080
I here take my oath
before this honourable assembly

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.800
she kicked the poor king, her father.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.200
Come hither, mistress.
Is your name Goneril?

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.280
She cannot deny it.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:05.040
Cry you mercy,
I took you for a joint stool.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:11.160
And here's another, whose warped looks
proclaim what store her heart is made on.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.200
Stop her there.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.840
Arms, arms, sword, fire,
corruption in the place!

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.960
False justicer,
why hast thou let her 'scape?

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:21.760
O pity! Sir, whoa…

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.040
Where…

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:28.000
Where's the patience now
that you so oft have boasted to retain?

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.080
The little dogs and all…

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:37.760
Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart,
they bark at me.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.920
Tom will throw his head at them.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.480
Avaunt, you curs!

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.520
Then let them anatomise Regan,

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.200
see what breeds about her heart.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:00.560
Is there any cause in nature
that makes these hard hearts?

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:09.360
You, sir, I entertain
for one of my hundred,

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.960
only I do not like your garments.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.640
You will say they are Persian,
but let them be changed.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.480
Now…

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.520
Good my lord…

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.520
Lie here and rest awhile.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.600
Make no noise, make no noise.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.920
Draw the curtains.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.520
So, so…

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.440
We'll go to supper in the morning.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.000
And I'll go to bed at noon.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.280
Come hither, friend.
Where is the king, my master?

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:32.720
Here, sir, but trouble him not.
His wits are gone.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.480
Good friend, I prithee take him
in thy arms. There is a litter ready.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.360
Lay him in it
and drive toward Dover, friend,

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.280
where thou wilt meet
welcome and protection.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.160
Take up! Take up thy master.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.080
If thou shouldst dally half an hour,

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:47.480
his life, with thine and all who offer
to defend him, stand in assured loss.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.200
Take up, take up, and follow me.

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:44.840
Who alone suffers
suffers most in the mind,

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:49.160
leaving free thoughts
and happy shows behind.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:56.480
How light and portable my pain seems
now,

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.840
when that which made me bend
made the king bow.

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.240
He childed… as I fathered.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:19.080
Tom…

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.360
Away.

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:00.560
The army of France is landed.
Seek out the traitor Gloucester.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.560
Go seek the traitor Gloucester!

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.840
Pinion him like a thief.

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.160
Bring him before us.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.240
Hang him instantly.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.600
Pluck out his eyes.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.200
Leave him to my displeasure.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:19.760
Edmund…

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.760
Keep you our sister company.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.720
The revenges we are bound to take
upon your traitorous father

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.640
are not fit for your beholding.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.720
- Farewell, dear sister.
- Farewell, sweet lord…

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.080
and sister.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.720
Edmund, farewell.

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.360
Who's there?

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.440
- The traitor?
- Ingrateful fox, 'tis he.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.200
Bind fast his corky arms.

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:19.840
What means your graces?

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:23.200
Good my friends, consider.
You are my guests.

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:24.760
Do me no foul play, friends.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.840
Bind him, I say.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.160
Hard. Hard!

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:32.439
- O filthy traitor.
- Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none!

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:36.120
To the chair bind him.
Villain, thou shalt find…

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:42.200
Ye kind gods! 'Tis most ignobly done
to pluck me by the beard.

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:44.359
So white and such a traitor.

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.640
These hairs which thou dost ravish

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.080
from my chin will quicken
and accuse thee.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.319
I'm your host!

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:56.160
With robbers' hands my hospitable favours
you should not ruffle thus.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.120
- What will you do?
- Come, sir.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.720
What letters had you late from France?

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.520
Be simple-answered
for we know the truth.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.040
What confederacy with traitors…

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:07.359
To whose hands
you have sent the lunatic king. Speak.

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:12.920
I have a letter guessingly set down,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.920
which comes from one
that's of a neutral heart,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.120
and not from one opposed.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.479
- Oh, cunning.
- And false.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.240
Where hast thou sent the king?

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.160
To Dover.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.399
Wherefore to Dover?
Wast thou not charged at peril…

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:29.800
Wherefore to Dover? Let him answer that.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.760
I am tied to the stake
and must stand the course.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.880
Wherefore to Dover?

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:39.880
Because I would not see thy cruel nails
pluck out his poor old eyes,

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:44.680
nor thy fierce sister in his anointed
flesh stick boarish fangs!

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.600
But I shall see the winged vengeance
overtake such children.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.920
See't shalt thou never.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.040
Fellows, hold the chair.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.680
Oh!

01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.480
Oh!

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.840
He who will think to live till he be old
give me some help!

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.320
O cruel!

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.920
O you gods!

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.960
One side will mock another.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.160
The other too.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
If you see vengeance…

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:00.920
Hold your hand, my lord. I have served you
ever since I was a child,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.680
but better service have I never done you
than now to bid you hold.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.880
How now, you dog!

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.880
If you did wear a beard upon your chin
I'll shake it on this quarrel.

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.000
What do you mean?

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.080
Nay then…

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.520
A peasant stand up thus!

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.320
My lord…

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:43.480
You have one eye left
to see some mischief on him.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:49.280
Lest it see more, prevent it.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.880
Out, vile jelly…

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.720
Where's my son Edmund?

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.560
Thou callest on him
that hates thee.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.320
It was he who made the overture
of thy treasons to us,

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.720
who is too good to pity thee.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.240
O my follies!

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.480
Then Edgar was abused.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.160
Kind gods, forgive me that

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.040
and prosper him.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:28.720
Go thrust him out at gates
and let him smell his way to Dover.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.320
How dost, my lord? How look you?

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.200
I have received a hurt.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:40.760
Ah, Regan…

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.240
I bleed apace.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.800
Untimely comes this hurt.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.680
Give me your arm.

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:12.920
To be worst, the lowest
and most dejected thing of fortune

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.600
stands still in hope, lives not in fear.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.360
Who is it can say, "I am at the worst"?

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:27.320
I am worse than ever I was.
And worse I may be yet.

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:33.160
The worst is not so long as we can say,
"This is the worst."

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:39.480
Away, get thee away,
good friend, begone.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.880
Thy comforts can do me no good at all,
thee they may hurt.

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.080
How now?

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.360
Who's there?

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.360
It is…

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.640
It is a poor madman.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.200
Fellow, where goest?

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:59.760
- Is it a beggar-man?
- Madman, and beggar too.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.640
In the last night's storm
I such a fellow saw.

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.680
Made me think a man a worm.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:09.280
My son came then into my mind and yet
my mind was then scarce friends with him.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.800
I have heard more since.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:16.040
As flies to wanton boys
are we to the gods.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.360
They kill us for their sport.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.800
Bless thee, master.

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.360
Is that the naked fellow?

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.640
Ay, my lord.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.600
Get thee away. Bring some covering
for this naked soul…

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.160
which I'll entreat to lead me.

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.600
Alack, sir. He is mad.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:37.440
'Tis the times' plague
when madmen lead the blind.

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.560
Do as I bid thee,
or rather do thy pleasure.

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.880
Above the rest, begone.

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.960
I'll bring the best apparel that I have,
come of it what will.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.360
Come hither, fellow.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.720
Dost thou know Dover?

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.280
Ay, master.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.080
There is a cliff whose high

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:06.520
and bending head looks fearfully in the
confined deep.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.960
Bring me but to the very brim of it.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.560
From that place I shall no leading need.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:15.840
Stand still!

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:22.640
How fearful and dizzy 'tis
to cast one's eyes so low!

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.000
I'll look no more,

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:30.240
lest my brain turn and
the deficient sight topple down headlong.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.800
Set me where you stand.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.520
Give me your hand.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:50.840
Whoa!

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:57.200
You are now within a foot
of the extreme verge.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.960
For all beneath the moon,
would I not look upright.

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.240
Let go my hand.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.880
Go thou farther off.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:17.840
Bid me farewell
and let me hear thee going.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.440
Now fare ye well, good sir.

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:24.640
With all my heart.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.960
O you mighty gods!

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.720
This world I do renounce.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.080
If Edgar live…

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.760
O bless him!

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.440
Now, fellow…

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:49.840
Fare thee well.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.600
Gone, sir. Farewell!

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.520
Ho you, sir? Friend?

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.200
Hear you, sir? Speak.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.360
What are you, sir?

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.080
Away and let me die.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:14.880
But thou dost breathe.
Thy life's a miracle.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.000
Speak yet again.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.080
But have I fallen or no?

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.600
From the dread summit
of this chalky bourn. Look up a height.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.960
- Do but look up.
- Alack, I have no eyes.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:35.920
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit
to end itself by death?

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:39.080
Give me your arm.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:41.800
Up.

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.520
So, how is it? Feel you your legs?

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.360
You stand.

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:55.160
Too well… Too well.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.720
Bear free and patient thoughts.

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.640
It is he.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.800
He was met even now
as mad as the vex'd sea.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.400
A century send forth, search every acre
in the high-grown field

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.600
and bring my father to our eye.

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.000
What can man's wisdom
in the restoring his bereaved sense?

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.480
There is means.

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:35.720
Our foster-nurse of nature is repose.

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.000
Seek, seek for him,

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:41.160
lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life
that wants the means to lead it.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.360
That fellow handles his bow
like a crow-keeper.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.760
Draw me a clothier's yard.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.000
Ha! Look, look, a mouse!

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:11.480
Peace, peace.
This piece of toasted cheese will do't.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.240
I know that voice.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.440
O, well flown, bird.
I'th'clout, I'th'clout. Hewgh!

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.120
Ah.

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.880
Shoo. Give the word.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.400
- Sweet marjoram.
- Pass.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.000
Goneril with a white beard?

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.360
They flattered me like a dog

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.320
and told me I had the white hairs in my
beard ere the black ones were there.

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.480
To say "ay" and "no"
to every thing I said!

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.520
"Ay" and "no" too was no good divinity.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.680
The trick of that voice
I do well remember. Is't not the king?

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:46.320
Ay, every inch a king.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:50.240
When I do stare,
see how the subject quakes.

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:53.680
I pardon that man's life.
What was thy cause? Adultery?

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.160
Thou shalt not die.

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.480
Die for adultery? No…

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.320
Let copulation thrive,

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:03.080
for Gloucester's bastard son
was kinder to his father

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.320
than my daughters
got 'tween the lawful sheets.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.720
To it, luxury, pell-mell,
for I lack soldiers.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.440
Down from the waist they are centaurs,
though women all above.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.480
But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
beneath is all the fiends'.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:18.080
There's hell, there's darkness,
there's the sulphurous pit,

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.280
burning, scalding, stench, consumption.
Fie, fie! Pah! Pah!

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.640
Give me an ounce of civet,
good apothecary,

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.120
to sweeten my imagination.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.440
There's money for thee.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.040
Let me kiss that hand.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.600
Now, let me wipe it first,
it smells of mortality.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.680
Dost thou know me?

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.760
I remember thine eyes well enough.

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.160
Read thou this challenge.
Mark but the penning of it.

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:48.840
Were all thy letters suns,
I could not see.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.800
- Read.
- What…

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.440
With the case of eyes?

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:57.720
O ho, are you there with me?

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:01.560
No eyes in your head,
nor no money in your purse?

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.600
Your eyes are in a heavy case,

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.360
yet you may see how this world goes.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.440
I see it feelingly.

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.120
What, art mad?

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:14.840
A man may see how this world goes
with no eyes.

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.600
Get thee glass eyes

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:20.400
and like a scurvy politician
seem to see the things

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:22.160
thou dost not.

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:24.200
Now, now, now…

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.240
If thou wilt weep my cause,

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.800
take my eyes.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:39.240
I know thee well enough.
Thy name is Gloucester.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.400
Thou must be patient.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.280
We came crying hither.

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.560
Thou knowest the first time
that we smell the air…

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.040
we wail and cry.

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.280
I will preach to thee, mark.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.680
When we are born, we cry

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:07.520
that we are come
to this great stage of fools.

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.280
Hey! This is a good block.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.520
Oy, oy…

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:24.800
It were a delicate stratagem
to shoe a troop of horse with felt. Sh!

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:30.400
I'll put it in proof, and when I have
stolen upon these son-in-laws,

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.920
then kill, kill, kill,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.560
- kill, kill, kill…
- Hey! There he is. Lay hand upon him!

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.840
Kill, kill, kill!

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.360
Come, come…

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:46.600
C'est bon. Doucement.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:48.400
I'm a king, masters, know you that?

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:53.240
- You are a royal one and we obey you.
- Then there's life in it.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.400
Come, and you get it,
you shall get it by running.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.480
Where's your master?

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.440
Madam, aloft, but never man so changed.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.680
I told him the French were landed.
He laughed at it.

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:10.520
And of Gloucester's treachery
when I informed him he called me sot,

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.600
and told me I'd turned the wrong way out.

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:23.080
Back, Edmund, to the troops.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.280
Hasten your musters
and conduct your powers.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.280
This trusty servant shall pass between us.

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:33.600
Ere long you are like to hear
a mistress's command.

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:37.600
Wear this.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.240
Spare speech.

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.760
Decline your head.

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:52.840
This kiss, if it durst speak,

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:56.080
would stretch thy spirits up into the air.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.360
Conceive…

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:05.280
and fare thee well.

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:10.440
Yours… in the ranks of death.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.160
My most dear Gloucester.

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.360
Oh…

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:33.920
The difference… of man and man.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:39.720
To thee a woman's services are due.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.200
A fool usurps my bed.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:45.280
Madam, here comes my lord.

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.080
I have been worth the whistle.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.080
O Goneril…

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:54.680
You are not worth the dust
which the rude wind blows in your face.

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:59.760
No more. The text is foolish.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:04.080
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem
vile, filths savour but themselves.

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:08.280
Milk-livered man, where's thy drum?

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:11.320
France spreads his banners
in our noiseless land,

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:16.120
whilst thou, a moral fool, sits still
and cries, "Alack, why does he so?"

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.800
See thyself, devil!

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:22.640
Proper deformity shows not
in the fiend so horrid as in woman.

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.720
O…

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:34.120
Vain… fool.

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.680
To both these sisters
have I sworn my love,

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:43.120
each jealous of the other
as the stung are of the adder.

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.040
Which of them shall I take?

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.600
Both? One?

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.320
Or neither?

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:57.120
Neither can be enjoyed
if both remain alive.

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.280
Tell me but truly,

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.920
but then speak the truth.

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:08.080
Do you not love my sister?

01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.320
In honoured love.

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:17.120
But have you never found my brother's
way to the forfended place?

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.160
That thought abuses you.

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:23.560
No, by mine honour, madam.

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.320
I never shall endure her.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.560
Dear my lord…

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.160
Be not familiar with her.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:34.640
Fear me not.

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:38.080
She and the duke, her husband.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.000
Our very loving sister, well be-met.

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:45.280
Sir, this I heard.
The king is come to his daughter,

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.640
with others whom the rigour of our state
forced to cry out.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.080
It touches us, as France invades our
land.

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.440
Sir, you speak nobly.

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:55.560
- Why is this reasoned?
- Combine together 'gainst the enemy,

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:59.160
for these domestic and particular broils
are not the question here.

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.880
Let's then determine on our proceeding.

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.800
- Sister, you'll go with us?
- No.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.760
'Tis most convenient. Pray, go with us.

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:19.760
Oh, I know the riddle.

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.120
I will go.

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:29.520
O thou good Kent.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:32.480
How can I live and work
to match thy goodness?

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:35.840
My life will be too short
and every measure fail me.

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:38.440
To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:43.560
All my reports go with the modest truth,
nor more, nor clipped, but so.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.280
O my dear father…

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:09.360
Restoration hang thy medicine on my lips

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:13.160
and let this kiss repair
those violent harms

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:15.880
that my two sisters
have in thy reverence made.

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:25.280
He wakes.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.240
Speak to him.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:32.560
Madam, do you. 'Tis fittest.

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.440
How does my royal lord?

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.080
How fares your majesty?

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:47.320
You do me wrong…

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.200
to take me out of the grave.

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:57.120
Thou art a soul in bliss,
but I am bound upon a wheel of fire

01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:01.360
that mine own tears
do scald like molten lead.

01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.000
Sir, do you know me?

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:14.640
You are a spirit, I know.

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.440
Where did you die?

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:23.760
Still far, far wide.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:25.840
He's scarce awake.

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.240
Let him alone awhile.

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:31.280
Where have I been? Where am I?

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:38.400
Fair daylight?

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:42.080
I am mightily abused.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:46.600
I should even die with pity
to see another thus.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:50.560
I know not what to say.

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.760
I will not swear these are my hands.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.640
Let's see.

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:02.400
I feel this pin prick.

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.440
Would I were assured of my condition.

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.640
O look upon me, sir,

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:17.280
and hold your hand in benediction o'er me.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.360
Ah…

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.560
You must not kneel.

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.320
Pray do not mock me.

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.200
I am a very foolish fond old man,

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:34.120
fourscore and upward,
not an hour more, nor less.

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:41.440
And, to deal plainly,
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:49.560
Methinks I should know you
and know this man.

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:51.280
Yet I am doubtful.

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.640
For I am mainly ignorant
what place this is

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:57.840
and all the skill I have
remembers not these garments,

01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:00.800
nor I know not
where I did lodge last night.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:06.560
Do not laugh at me,

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:08.640
for, as I am a man,

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.760
I think this lady to be my child…

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.960
Cordelia.

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:22.200
And so I am…

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.640
I am.

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:26.560
Be your tears wet?

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:29.840
I pray thee… weep not.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:34.480
If you have poison for me,
I will drink it.

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:37.160
I know you do not love me,

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:40.440
for your sisters have,
as I do remember, done me wrong.

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.520
You have some cause, they have not.

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:45.200
No cause, no cause.

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:57.880
Am I in France?

01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:02.520
- In your own kingdom, sir.
- Do not abuse me.

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.240
Be comforted, good madam.

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.120
The great rage, you see, is killed in him.

01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:11.240
Desire him to go in.

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:13.320
Will it please your highness walk?

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:19.040
Ah… You must bear with me.

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:24.960
Pray you now, forget and forgive.

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:30.680
I am old…

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.320
and foolish.

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.360
Fire!

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:11.880
Fire!

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:23.440
Take cover!

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:52.000
If ever I return to you again,
I'll bring you comfort.

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.960
Grace go with you, sir.

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.480
On le recherche sur toute cette zone.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.880
Après nous pourrons déployer
si vous voulez

01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.840
une autre troupe du côté du château…

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:41.920
Away!

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.600
Old man!

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.120
Give me thy hand, away!

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.640
King Lear hath lost,
he and his daughter taken.

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:49.720
Give me thy hand. Come on!

01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:51.760
No further, sir.

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.920
A man may rot even here.

01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:02.960
Men must endure their
going hence even as their coming hither.

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.880
Ripeness is all.

01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:12.320
Oh… Oh…

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.400
Oh…

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.160
Right, left.

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:52.680
We are not the first who with best
meaning have incurred the worst!

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:55.760
Shall we not see these daughters
and these sisters?

01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.040
No, no, no, no.

01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:59.600
Come, let's away to prison.

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.080
Ha…

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:04.360
We two alone will sing
like birds in the cage.

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:07.120
When thou dost ask me blessing,

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:10.000
I'll kneel down
and ask of thee forgiveness.

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:16.480
And so we'll live, and pray,
and sing, and tell old tales,

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:18.880
and laugh at gilded butterflies.

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:24.720
And hear poor rogues talk of court news
and we'll talk with them too,

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:28.680
who loses and who wins,
who's in, who's out…

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.640
and take upon us the mystery of things

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:38.640
as if we were God's spies.

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:45.760
And we'll wear out in a walled prison
packs and sects of great ones

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.880
that ebb and flow by the moon.

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:57.160
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:05.520
the gods themselves throw incense.

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:09.920
Hm! Have I caught thee?

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.040
He that parts us
shall bring a brand from heaven,

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.280
and fire us hence like foxes.

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:20.600
Wipe thine eyes.

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:25.440
The good years shall devour them,
flesh and fell

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.120
ere they shall make us weep.

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:30.440
We'll see 'em starved first.

01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:44.960
Come.

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:50.080
One step I have advanced thee.

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:56.280
If thou dost as this instructs thee,
thou dost make thy way to noble fortunes.

01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:13.200
Either say thou'lt do it
or thrive by other means.

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.720
I cannot draw a cart nor eat dried oats.

01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:18.880
If it be man's work, I'll do it.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.880
Sir, you have showed today your valiant
strain, and fortune led you well.

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.640
You have the captives who were
the opposites of this day's strife.

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:35.160
I do require them of you

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:38.640
so that we shall find their merits
and our safety may equally determine.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:44.240
Sir, I thought it fit to send the old
and miserable king to some retention.

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:47.120
At this time we sweat and bleed.

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.840
The friend hath lost his friend,

01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.800
and the best quarrels in the heat

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:53.400
are cursed by those
that feel their sharpness.

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:57.960
The question of Cordelia and her father
requires a fitter place.

01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:02.120
Sir, by your patience, I hold you but
a subject of this war, not as a brother.

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:06.120
He led our powers, bore the commission
of my place and person,

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:10.040
the which immediacy may well stand up
and call itself your brother.

01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:11.120
Not so hot.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:15.320
In his own grace he doth exalt himself
more than in your addition.

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:20.440
In my rights by me invested,
he compeers the best.

01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:22.600
That were the most
if he should husband you.

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.600
Jesters do oft prove prophets.

01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:28.560
Uh-uh. That eye that told you so
looked but asquint.

01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:31.080
Lady, I am not well,

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:35.440
else I should answer
from a full-flowing stomach.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:40.240
General…

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:46.480
Take thou my soldiers, prisoners,
patrimony.

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.720
Dispose of them, of me.
These walls are thine.

01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:55.160
Witness the world that I create thee here
my lord and master.

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.760
The let-alone lies not in your good will.

01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:59.520
Nor in thine, lord.

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.360
Half-blooded fellow, yes.

01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:03.280
Prove my title thine.

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:07.440
Edmund, I arrest thee on capital treason,
and in thy attaint this gilded serpent.

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.960
An interlude.

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:10.480
Let the challenge sound.

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:14.000
If none appear to prove upon thy person
thy heinous, manifest and many treasons,

01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:16.480
here is my pledge.
I'll make it on my heart.

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.960
There's my exchange.

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:21.080
What in the world he is
that names me traitor,

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:23.560
villain-like he lies.

01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:28.880
He that dares approach,
on him, on you, who not?

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:31.680
I will maintain
my truth and honour firmly.

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.560
Let the challenge sound.

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:36.680
My sickness grows upon me.

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:40.120
She is not well, convey her to my room.

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:56.000
If any man of quality or degree
within the lists of the army

01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:00.600
will maintain upon Edmund,
supposed Earl of Gloucester,

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:03.200
that he is a manifold traitor,

01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:05.560
let him appear!

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.640
What sayest thou?

01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:33.680
Thou art a traitor,

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:38.280
false to thy gods, thy brother,
and thy father.

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:42.080
Back do I toss these treasons to thy
head.

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.920
Yeah! Come on!

01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:00.360
Fight!

01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.120
- Get up!
- Get up.

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:53.360
Thou art not vanquished
but cozened and beguiled!

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:55.120
Shut your mouth, dame!

01:43:57.600 --> 01:43:58.600
No!

01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:01.120
Go with her. She's desperate.

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:12.240
What you have charged me with,
that have I done.

01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:15.600
And more, much more.

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.240
But what art thou?

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:22.800
I am no less in blood
than thou art, Edmund.

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:24.880
My name is Edgar…

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:26.960
and thy father's son.

01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:29.280
The wheel is come full circle.

01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:31.880
I am here.

01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:37.800
O that my heart would burst…

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:39.800
Help! Help!

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:43.520
Well, speak, man.

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:45.120
This knife…

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:48.400
This knife came even from the heart of…

01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:50.240
Well, who, man? Speak!

01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:51.880
Your lady, sir.

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:56.240
Your lady.
And her sister by her is poisoned.

01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:58.960
She confesses it.

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:00.840
Produce the bodies.

01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.320
Be they alive or dead.

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:04.720
Go on.

01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:07.520
I was contracted to them both.

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:11.480
All three now marry in an instant.

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.880
I am come to bid my king and master
aye good night.

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.000
Is he not here?

01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:35.800
Seest thou this object, Kent?

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:42.560
I pant for life.

01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:44.760
Quickly send…

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:48.200
for my writ is on the life of Lear
and on Cordelia.

01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:51.320
Send in time!

01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:54.360
- Haste thee for thy life!
- Bear him hence!

01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:04.520
Howl!

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:14.960
Howl!

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:17.960
Howl!

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.680
Howl!

01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:25.640
O you are men of stones.

01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:32.560
Had I your tongues and eyes, I'd use them
so that heaven's vault should crack.

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:53.440
She's gone… for ever.

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:24.920
I know when one is dead
and when one lives.

01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:28.520
She's dead as earth.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.880
This feather stirs.

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:36.040
She lives.

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:42.600
If it be so, it is a chance

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:48.040
which does redeem all sorrows
that ever I have felt.

01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:50.400
O my good master…

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.080
Prithee, away.

01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:55.360
'Tis noble Kent, your friend.

01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:59.920
A plague upon us, murderers, traitors all!

01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:03.440
I might have saved her.

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:06.400
Now she's gone…

01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:08.920
for ever.

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:14.440
Cordelia…

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:17.080
Cordelia, stay a little. Ha?

01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:19.360
What is't thou sayest?

01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:26.200
Her voice was ever soft, gentle and low.

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:29.280
An excellent thing in woman.

01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.760
I killed the slave
that was a-hanging thee.

01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:37.000
Did I not, fellow?

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.240
'Tis true, my lords, he did.

01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:51.480
I have seen the day, with my good biting
falchion I'd have made 'em skip!

01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:59.640
I'm old now,

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:01.960
and these same crosses spoil me.

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.640
This is a dull sight.

01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:14.160
Who are you?

01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:18.080
Mine eyes are not of the best,
I'll tell you straight.

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.920
Are you not Kent?

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.920
The same, your servant Kent.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.880
Where is your servant, Caius?

01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:29.040
He's a good man, I'll tell you that.

01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:32.520
He'll strike, and quickly too.
He's dead and rotten.

01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:34.360
No, my good lord!

01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.600
- I am the very man…
- I'll see that straight.

01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:40.880
…that from your first of difference
and decay have followed your sad steps.

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:42.200
You are welcome hither.

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:46.840
He knows not what he says
and vain is it that we present us to him.

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:49.400
My lords and noble friends,
know our intent.

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:52.680
What comfort to this great decay
may come shall be applied.

01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:54.960
For us, we will resign

01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.800
during the life of this old majesty
to him our absolute power.

01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:00.360
O see, see!

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:08.240
And… and my poor fool…
is hanged.

01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:11.880
No… No…

01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:15.880
No life.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.920
Why should a dog, a horse,
a rat have life…

01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:27.360
and thou no breath at all?

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:32.040
Thou'lt come no more.

01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:40.880
Never…

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:42.720
Never…

01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:46.640
Never, never, never…

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.360
Pray you, undo this button.

01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:01.240
Thank you, sir.

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.560
See this?

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:08.600
Look…

01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:10.120
On her, her lips.

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:12.360
Look there, look there.

01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:15.720
He faints.

01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:18.600
My lord…

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:21.520
My lord?

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:25.800
Oh. Break, heart, I prithee break.

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:29.320
Look up, my lord.

01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:32.280
O, vex not his ghost.
O, let him pass.

01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:36.600
He hates him that would upon the rack of
this tough world stretch him out longer.

01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:50.800
He is gone indeed.

01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:04.080
The wonder is he hath endured so long.

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:09.080
He but usurped his life.

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:28.600
Friends of my soul,

01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:33.400
you twain rule in this realm
and the gor'd state sustain.

01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:37.320
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:41.920
My master calls me. I must not say no.

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:10.880
The weight of this sad time we must obey,

01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:17.280
speak what we feel,
not what we ought to say.

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:21.160
The oldest hath borne most.

01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:26.480
We that are young shall never see so
much,

01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:33.120
nor live so long.
