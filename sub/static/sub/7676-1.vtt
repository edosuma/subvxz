00:23.812 --> 00:27.927
Guards! Royal salute! Present arms!

01:11.435 --> 01:15.028
Some people are born
more fortunate than others.

01:15.113 --> 01:17.422
Such was the case with me.

01:17.513 --> 01:22.186
But as a child,
i was convinced of quite the opposite.

01:23.030 --> 01:27.021
What little girl does not dream
of growing up as a princess?

01:28.948 --> 01:32.700
But some palaces
are not at all what you'd think.

01:32.786 --> 01:36.222
Even a palace... can be a prison.

01:41.504 --> 01:44.812
Mama never explained why she
would have someone taste my food.

01:44.902 --> 01:49.373
Why i couldn't attend school with
other children or read popular books.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.810
When my father died,

01:58.898 --> 02:02.650
Mama and her adviser,
Sir John Conroy, created rules.

02:02.736 --> 02:05.569
He said they were for my protection,

02:05.656 --> 02:08.930
and he called it the Kensington System.

02:09.014 --> 02:11.244
i could not sleep in a room
without Mama

02:11.334 --> 02:14.688
or even walk downstairs
without holding the hand of an adult.

02:18.611 --> 02:22.079
i learned the reason for all this
when i was 11.

02:23.049 --> 02:25.517
My uncle William
was the King of England.

02:25.609 --> 02:30.635
Yet he and his three brothers
could boast only one living child.

02:32.165 --> 02:34.201
And that was me.

02:34.285 --> 02:37.243
Sir John's dream
was that the King would die

02:37.325 --> 02:39.439
and there would be a Regency,

02:39.523 --> 02:44.356
where my mother would rule England
and he would rule my mother.

02:44.441 --> 02:48.798
So i began to dream of the day
when my life would change...

02:49.959 --> 02:52.314
.. and i might be free.

02:52.399 --> 02:55.311
And i prayed for the strength
to meet my destiny.

02:55.398 --> 02:56.876
I will be good.

03:26.066 --> 03:28.216
God save the Queen!

03:28.306 --> 03:32.695
God save the Queen!
God save the Queen!

03:47.260 --> 03:48.579
Sign it!

03:48.660 --> 03:51.252
Are you sure
that we're doing the right thing?

03:51.338 --> 03:53.329
We've waited long enough.

03:53.418 --> 03:56.089
Now, for the last time,
you will sign this order.

03:56.176 --> 03:57.848
I will not sign it.

03:59.416 --> 04:01.166
I say you will!

04:01.254 --> 04:03.847
- I say I will not.
- How dare you, you...!

04:03.933 --> 04:06.367
Sir John.

04:07.491 --> 04:08.765
We were just...

04:08.851 --> 04:12.161
It's time for the Princess's medicine.

04:13.929 --> 04:15.920
- Shall I?
- I'll do it.

04:16.809 --> 04:18.798
Well, if you're sure.

04:24.047 --> 04:27.799
- Good night, mein liebling.
- Good night, Mama.

04:33.883 --> 04:35.601
How are you?

04:48.677 --> 04:51.111
I've received a letter from England.

04:51.197 --> 04:55.586
My sister says Victoria won't sign
the order for her Regency.

04:55.675 --> 04:57.551
And why would she sign it?

04:57.634 --> 05:01.591
The Princess is nearly 18. Why
would she sign away her own powers?

05:01.672 --> 05:04.106
Because she is an ignorant baby.

05:04.192 --> 05:08.308
Because she needs guidance and time
to prepare for her role as Queen.

05:09.270 --> 05:12.817
Until then, my sister
will take her place as Regent.

05:12.908 --> 05:15.820
Sir John Conroy would be Regent.

05:15.908 --> 05:19.535
Unfortunately, the Duchess
is controlled by her controller.

05:20.626 --> 05:25.015
It may be in Your Majesty's interests
to abandon Conroy and your sister,

05:25.104 --> 05:29.256
before it's too late,
and support the future Queen instead.

05:29.344 --> 05:32.014
Of course, the Duchess won't like it.

05:33.421 --> 05:37.253
Baron, I was born the younger son
of a penniless duke.

05:37.339 --> 05:39.773
Now I'm King of the Belgians.

05:39.859 --> 05:44.089
Such journeys are not managed
without hard decisions.

05:45.737 --> 05:49.967
Besides,
who controls a young girl most?

05:50.055 --> 05:53.364
Now go to Germany
and finish my nephew's training.

05:55.532 --> 05:57.329
Albert!

06:04.130 --> 06:07.279
I suppose you want
to walk with me this afternoon.

06:09.408 --> 06:14.799
Really? Just the two of us alone?
What would Mama say?

06:23.842 --> 06:26.640
Hold still
or I'll never get your nose right.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.988
Oh, I give up!

06:36.078 --> 06:41.548
I give up. You are impossible.
You are impossible. You are impossible.

06:41.636 --> 06:44.833
Victoria, your mother's waiting.

06:47.993 --> 06:49.665
Come on!

06:51.233 --> 06:52.632
Dash!

07:11.785 --> 07:14.857
- Where is the Duchess?
- In the drawing room, Your Highness.

07:20.623 --> 07:25.615
It will take them three days
to arrive by coach from Coburg. Dashy!

07:25.701 --> 07:28.930
- How did you come downstairs?
- I walked.

07:29.019 --> 07:30.816
- Not alone?
- No, not alone.

07:30.899 --> 07:33.174
- Lehzen was with me.
- She held your hand?

07:33.259 --> 07:35.452
She did. Though why she still has to...

07:35.537 --> 07:39.086
Because not everyone in England
wishes you well.

07:39.177 --> 07:41.005
Put the book down, please.

07:50.412 --> 07:52.164
Dashy!

07:52.252 --> 07:55.048
England is the key to peace in Europe.

07:55.130 --> 07:59.007
Your uncle's throne is six years old
and born of civil war.

07:59.088 --> 08:03.161
He only took the crown of Belgium
because England pledged her support.

08:03.248 --> 08:07.603
And if he's to survive, he must have
English force at his disposal.

08:07.686 --> 08:09.278
Favourite novels?

08:13.444 --> 08:17.230
- Sie hat nicht viele Romane gelesen.
- English. Always English.

08:18.682 --> 08:22.118
She has not read many novels.
They were forbidden until last year.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.270
- But she did like...?
- The Bride of Lammermoor.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.554
- By?
- Sir Walter Scott.

08:25.640 --> 08:29.108
- Other recreations?
- Drawing. The famous dolls, of course.

08:29.198 --> 08:33.316
Piano. Music, generally. It's hard
to believe she knows so little Schubert.

08:33.398 --> 08:35.828
Never mind Schubert.
She likes modern composers.

08:35.914 --> 08:39.953
- Is she permitted the theatre?
- Only the opera and ballet.

08:40.034 --> 08:42.227
Which opera does she like best?

08:45.673 --> 08:47.582
- Norma?

08:47.671 --> 08:49.468
i Puritani!

08:55.669 --> 08:58.739
in order to maintain control
over Princess Victoria,

08:58.827 --> 09:03.139
Sir John and the Duchess keep her
away from King William's court.

09:03.227 --> 09:06.103
Thus when she does
make a public appearance,

09:06.185 --> 09:09.575
her mere presence causes quite a stir.

09:25.739 --> 09:30.446
You must win her favour
before anyone else has the chance.

09:38.334 --> 09:41.563
You still don't look well.
Maybe we should go away for August.

09:41.652 --> 09:44.371
- No, Mama.
- What do you mean, no?

09:45.612 --> 09:48.647
We missed the Queen's birthday.
We will not miss the King's.

09:48.730 --> 09:51.085
We've accepted. We're going.

09:51.170 --> 09:56.162
Really, Victoria, don't issue
orders to me. I'm not a servant.

09:56.248 --> 10:00.000
Well, you've already disobeyed
about the extra rooms. That's enough.

10:00.886 --> 10:03.446
Are we to live like rabbits,
crammed in a hutch?

10:03.524 --> 10:06.960
We live in a palace, Mama.
We're a lot better off than most people.

10:07.044 --> 10:09.556
The rooms which I took were empty.

10:09.642 --> 10:13.351
Keeping us out of them
was... almost immoral.

10:14.362 --> 10:17.238
- That's what John says.
- I knew he'd have a part in it.

10:19.200 --> 10:23.315
My dearest child,
he only wants what's best for you.

10:23.397 --> 10:25.467
I wish you could believe that.

10:29.115 --> 10:32.471
I've invited the Coburg brothers
to come and stay.

10:32.555 --> 10:35.704
- You ought to know them better.
- Why?

10:35.793 --> 10:37.784
Because you should.

10:39.431 --> 10:43.583
- Uncle Leopold thinks it's a good idea.

10:47.669 --> 10:50.866
You stick one more pin in me,
I swear I will call the guard.

10:52.987 --> 10:57.536
Your first visit is the most important.
We can not have any mistakes.

10:57.625 --> 11:01.220
And always remember,
you're first a Coburg.

11:03.863 --> 11:08.857
The King of the Belgians is a Coburg.
The King of Portugal is a Coburg,

11:08.941 --> 11:13.298
so is the Queen of England's mother.
And you are the next piece in the game!

11:13.381 --> 11:15.846
Now go to England and make her smile.

11:18.978 --> 11:21.444
Is this all the luggage?

11:21.536 --> 11:25.734
- What if she wants to dance?
- It's your first visit. She won't.

11:36.452 --> 11:39.362
- Your Serene Highnesses, welcome.
- Thank you.

11:39.450 --> 11:43.841
I'm Sir John Conroy, controller of the
Duchess's household. This way, please.

11:58.044 --> 11:59.921
The Duchess is in the drawing room.

12:06.242 --> 12:10.869
- Ah! May I present her Royal...
- Hello.

12:14.199 --> 12:17.985
I'm Ernst, ma'am.
This is my brother, Albert.

12:23.355 --> 12:27.187
- We haven't interrupt your studies?
- No, not at all.

12:27.273 --> 12:30.583
- How was your journey?
- Long, but not too bad.

12:30.673 --> 12:32.263
We had books to keep us busy.

12:32.351 --> 12:36.230
As matter of fact, I passed the time
reading The Bride of Lammermoor.

12:37.911 --> 12:40.901
By Sir Walter... Scott.

12:42.189 --> 12:43.781
Yes.

12:47.147 --> 12:50.023
Do you want to come and meet Mama?

13:04.820 --> 13:08.936
Of the modern composers, I suppose
Vincenzo Bellini is my favourite.

13:09.018 --> 13:12.693
What a coincidence! So is mine.
Which of his operas do you enjoy most?

13:12.778 --> 13:17.531
- No, wait, let me guess. i Puritani?
- As a matter of fact, yes.

13:17.616 --> 13:21.243
I used to like it too.
Now I prefer Norma.

13:23.454 --> 13:26.603
Dashy! Go fetch it! Fetch it, Dash!

13:28.692 --> 13:30.284
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

13:34.210 --> 13:38.121
- Have I offended you in some way?
- No.

13:43.606 --> 13:45.676
And Schubert.

13:46.846 --> 13:48.757
I like Schubert.

13:49.604 --> 13:54.280
I think...
I think perhaps you don't,... but I do.

13:55.962 --> 13:58.191
I don't mind Schubert.

13:59.601 --> 14:01.193
Good.

14:28.591 --> 14:31.661
Do you ever feel like
a chess piece yourself?

14:31.749 --> 14:35.219
In a game being played
against your will?

14:35.309 --> 14:38.504
- Do you?
- Constantly.

14:38.587 --> 14:42.500
I see them leaning in
and moving me around the board.

14:42.587 --> 14:45.622
The Duchess and Sir John?

14:45.705 --> 14:49.412
Not just them. Uncle Leopold.

14:49.503 --> 14:53.939
The King. I'm sure half the politicians
are ready to seize hold of my skirts

14:54.022 --> 14:57.808
and drag me from square to square.

15:02.258 --> 15:06.649
Then master the rules of the game
until you play it better than they can.

15:09.816 --> 15:13.363
You don't recommend I find a husband
to play it for me?

15:14.374 --> 15:17.764
I should find one to play it with you,
not for you.

15:21.012 --> 15:24.969
Why don't we ring for some music?
And then we could dance.

15:25.050 --> 15:29.123
I've recently discovered the waltz
and I am quite in love with it.

15:31.848 --> 15:36.444
- Waltzing is not really my forte.
- Oh, dear.

15:38.486 --> 15:39.919
What a shame.

15:46.803 --> 15:50.032
You know the King wants me to marry
my cousin George?

15:51.081 --> 15:52.753
Hmm.

15:53.761 --> 15:55.750
What's he like at chess?

16:10.675 --> 16:12.265
Victoria.

16:13.553 --> 16:16.272
It's alright, Lehzen,
Albert can take me up.

16:16.353 --> 16:19.548
You'll have to hold my hand.
Mama insists. I hope you don't mind.

16:19.631 --> 16:21.428
Not in the least.

16:29.709 --> 16:31.697
What did you want to say?

16:33.906 --> 16:38.295
Only that I understand more
than you think of what your life is.

16:38.384 --> 16:39.817
Do you?

16:39.904 --> 16:43.291
My childhood wasn't easy either.
I lost my mother when I was a boy.

16:43.381 --> 16:45.736
- I know. She died.
- No, er...

16:45.821 --> 16:49.095
That is, she did die eventually, but...

16:49.179 --> 16:52.216
she was sent away long before that.

16:52.299 --> 16:54.765
There was some difficulty.

16:54.857 --> 16:58.247
It was all hushed up
and... no one talks of it now.

16:59.337 --> 17:03.726
But I know what it is to live
alone inside your head,

17:03.815 --> 17:07.010
while never giving a clue
as to your real feelings.

17:09.252 --> 17:11.685
Did Uncle Leopold
ask you to tell me that?

17:11.771 --> 17:15.002
No. Er, he actually told me
never to mention it.

17:15.090 --> 17:19.320
Well, how little he knows me.

17:20.329 --> 17:21.921
Hmm.

17:37.082 --> 17:39.073
May I write to you?

18:15.230 --> 18:18.220
You'll miss the princes
when they're gone, ma'am.

18:18.308 --> 18:20.060
Don't be impertinent.

18:22.868 --> 18:25.585
- Those boys pester you.
- Oh, please, Lehzen.

18:25.666 --> 18:30.259
You don't think I've come this far
to walk into another jail, do you?

18:32.623 --> 18:36.614
- You must marry one day.
- Well, I don't see why.

18:37.621 --> 18:39.737
And if I do, I shall please myself,

18:39.821 --> 18:44.574
not Mama or Uncle Leopold or the King
or anyone else. Trust me.

18:59.413 --> 19:02.325
- Must I?
- Yes, you must.

19:02.893 --> 19:03.882
Be on your guard.

19:03.973 --> 19:06.531
We are going to Windsor
for my uncle's birthday party.

19:06.611 --> 19:09.569
- In the castle of the enemy.
- Your enemy, Sir John, not mine.

19:09.651 --> 19:12.641
- Agree to nothing.
- What should I say about the rooms?

19:12.729 --> 19:16.404
You needed the space.
Appeal to the Queen. It's ridiculous.

19:16.487 --> 19:19.479
I wish you were coming with us.

19:28.124 --> 19:31.398
You're very intent, Baroness.
Are you making a study of me?

19:31.482 --> 19:32.915
Someone should.

19:40.398 --> 19:44.027
- Present Prime Minister?
- Melbourne.

19:44.118 --> 19:46.109
Lord Melbourne.

19:46.196 --> 19:50.712
The Liberal leader who'll probably be
in power when the Princess succeeds.

19:50.796 --> 19:53.467
- He may be troublesome.
- Why?

19:53.554 --> 19:56.944
He puts the interests of England
above those of Europe.

19:57.034 --> 20:01.025
- Which is bad?
- Which is not useful to us.

20:01.112 --> 20:05.706
He wouldn't spill one drop of
English blood to save a foreign throne.

20:05.790 --> 20:08.145
The Viscount Melbourne.

20:11.508 --> 20:15.581
Why would he save a foreign throne
if it wasn't in England's interest?

20:15.668 --> 20:20.864
That is just the kind of thinking
your Uncle Leopold is afraid of.

20:24.103 --> 20:28.731
Which is why he's content to find his
niece is the future Queen of England.

20:28.821 --> 20:30.891
The Duke of Wellington.

20:30.981 --> 20:35.495
in the public mind, the leader of the
Conservative opposition is a pet hero,

20:35.579 --> 20:38.377
Napoleon's conqueror,
the grand old Duke of Wellington.

20:38.459 --> 20:40.891
- But not in fact.
- No.

20:40.977 --> 20:43.775
- You look in very good health, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

20:43.857 --> 20:47.609
- I wish I was. Enjoy the meal.
- Thank you.

20:47.695 --> 20:51.572
The next T ory Prime Minister
will be Sir Robert Peel.

20:51.653 --> 20:53.405
.. and Lady Peel.

20:56.773 --> 20:59.331
Which side does Victoria favour?

20:59.411 --> 21:04.529
She's a Liberal. Above all,
she favours Lord Melbourne.

21:04.609 --> 21:07.282
And he'll take full advantage of it.

21:09.009 --> 21:11.998
Her Royal Highness,
Princess Victoria of Kent.

21:18.004 --> 21:20.518
Her Royal Highness,
the Duchess of Kent.

21:20.604 --> 21:22.593
The Lady Flora Hastings.

21:28.600 --> 21:32.388
- Hello, Uncle.
- Look at that demure little head.

21:32.480 --> 21:35.754
And all of us
wondering what's inside it.

21:35.838 --> 21:37.749
We'll find out soon enough.

21:37.838 --> 21:42.626
Lord Melbourne will make her fall
in love with him. It's his method.

21:43.676 --> 21:47.553
- Don't underestimate Victoria.
- Don't underestimate Melbourne.

21:49.074 --> 21:51.586
My dearest niece.

21:51.672 --> 21:55.631
- Won't you greet your cousin George?
- Good evening, George.

21:55.712 --> 21:59.020
How can my niece and nephew have
grown up so when I wasn't looking?

21:59.110 --> 22:02.546
Whereas you are quite unchanged
and as handsome as ever.

22:02.630 --> 22:06.666
If I put my head very close to yours
and speak softly,

22:06.747 --> 22:09.054
- they'll think we're hatching a plot.
- Yes.

22:09.145 --> 22:11.215
If I look a little surprised,...

22:11.305 --> 22:14.775
- well, then they'll know it.

22:14.863 --> 22:21.096
I wish we saw more of you. But then,
nor you nor I are to blame for that.

22:21.181 --> 22:25.174
The plain fact is, madam,
you have stolen 17 rooms!

22:26.899 --> 22:31.689
One cannot steal a room, sir.
The rooms are where you left them.

22:31.779 --> 22:34.371
Now they are used,
before they were empty.

22:34.457 --> 22:37.415
I see. So I have no say
in my own palaces?

22:37.497 --> 22:40.487
Why not move in here
and bring your Irish tinker with you?

22:40.575 --> 22:43.533
The Queen and I
will be happy enough in the lodge!

22:43.615 --> 22:48.892
So would I be, sir, if I thought that
people there would be polite to me!

22:48.973 --> 22:51.849
- How dare you talk...!
- Enough!

22:53.651 --> 22:55.642
You have exhausted the topic.

22:58.808 --> 23:02.640
Conroy tried to force the Princess
Victoria's agreement to a Regency.

23:02.726 --> 23:07.436
She wouldn't sign it, sick as she was.
That says something for her spirit.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.436
Your next birthday
will be quite a landmark.

23:27.518 --> 23:31.193
- I hope we'll see more of you at Court.
- I hope so too, Lord Melbourne.

23:34.836 --> 23:38.873
You know,
should you ever need an ally,...

23:38.954 --> 23:41.343
you have one in me.

23:41.434 --> 23:44.822
The Prime Minister
has more important calls upon his time.

23:44.912 --> 23:47.221
Not at all.
I knew the late Duke of Kent.

23:47.312 --> 23:49.587
Naturally,
I take an interest in his daughter.

23:49.672 --> 23:53.901
- You knew my father?
- Yes.

23:53.989 --> 23:56.865
I'm sorry.
Is it difficult to speak of him?

23:56.947 --> 24:01.702
No. I love to hear from someone who
knew him. For I never did, you see.

24:01.787 --> 24:07.542
Well,... he was a great gentleman.
Of that you can be sure.

24:07.625 --> 24:09.056
Indeed I am.

24:09.143 --> 24:13.931
Excellent company like his brother, the
Regent, but not quite so extravagant.

24:15.101 --> 24:22.255
And kind, like his brother, the King,...
but perhaps not so talkative.

24:24.259 --> 24:27.374
Well, you make him sound
as though he were the best of them.

24:27.457 --> 24:30.017
Oh, I think so, ma'am.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.410
Your leader is hard at work, Duchess.

24:33.495 --> 24:38.442
You see him hover with his net
to catch the pretty butterfly.

24:38.533 --> 24:42.765
And when your party is back in power,
Duke, will you not do the same?

24:42.853 --> 24:46.445
Not nearly as well as Melbourne.

24:46.530 --> 24:50.999
Unfortunately, I have no small talk.
Peel has no manners.

24:52.128 --> 24:55.516
And I would have a hard time
praising her father.

24:55.606 --> 24:58.882
The most brutal officer
I ever encountered.

25:46.749 --> 25:51.138
I thank you
for your good wishes on my birthday.

25:52.507 --> 25:56.339
It has been a long life...
and an interesting one.

25:57.625 --> 26:02.253
But I shall be content
with only a short while more.

26:02.343 --> 26:09.133
Just enough... to dispense
with any thought of a Regency,...

26:10.541 --> 26:17.854
.. so that I may pass the Royal
Authority directly to that young lady.

26:18.817 --> 26:25.163
And not... to the hands...
of a person now near me...

26:26.615 --> 26:30.244
.. who is surrounded by evil advisers

26:30.335 --> 26:35.929
and who cannot act with propriety in
the station in which she's been placed!

26:37.010 --> 26:39.763
I have been insulted!

26:39.850 --> 26:43.363
Grossly and continually insulted!

26:43.448 --> 26:50.443
She has kept her daughter,
my brother's child, from my Court!

26:50.526 --> 26:55.757
But from now on,
I'd have her know that I am King!

26:55.844 --> 26:59.632
And I will not be flouted
or disobeyed by her

26:59.724 --> 27:03.317
or by that jackanapes
she keeps about her!

27:11.000 --> 27:12.954
Are you alright?

27:16.118 --> 27:19.188
Families, who'd be without them?

28:01.820 --> 28:03.617
Are you listening?

28:06.378 --> 28:07.970
What?

28:17.734 --> 28:20.646
- Well?
- Ma'am, you do have a letter,

28:20.734 --> 28:23.768
but it's not from Germany,
it's from the King.

28:25.651 --> 28:28.370
So it is. Thank you, Watson.

28:35.407 --> 28:38.763
- Don't you see what he wants?
- He increases my income

28:38.847 --> 28:42.804
once I'm 18 and he asks to see me
at Court, what is wrong with that?

28:42.885 --> 28:47.479
The King wants to separate you from
your mother. He wants to control you,

28:47.563 --> 28:50.680
to take you from those whose sole aim
is trying to protect you!

28:50.763 --> 28:54.071
No need to shout. The people
will find out our business soon enough

28:54.161 --> 28:57.392
without hearing it from your lips.

28:57.481 --> 29:00.755
Tell her. Make her understand.

29:01.679 --> 29:05.636
What Sir John means is that you're
unprepared for the task ahead of you.

29:05.717 --> 29:07.628
And if I am, whose fault is that?

29:07.717 --> 29:10.515
You're too young! You've no experience!

29:10.597 --> 29:13.393
You're like a china doll
walking over a precipice!

29:13.475 --> 29:17.306
Well, then, I must smash!
For it's too late to mend my ways now!

29:17.392 --> 29:20.828
- So if you'll excuse me...
- But I will not excuse you!

29:20.912 --> 29:23.868
Now this is what you will do!

29:23.950 --> 29:28.102
First, you will refuse the money and
demand that it be given to your mother.

29:28.190 --> 29:32.500
Next, you will appoint me
your private secretary from today.

29:32.588 --> 29:35.464
Finally, you will agree
to be co-regent with the Duchess

29:35.546 --> 29:40.062
until your 25th birthday.
Neither she nor I will accept less!

29:40.146 --> 29:43.102
You may do
what you like with the money.

29:43.184 --> 29:45.618
Now, get out of my way!

29:51.382 --> 29:54.816
And if you think that I will ever forget

29:54.900 --> 29:58.370
that you just stood by silent
and you watched him treat me thus,

29:58.460 --> 30:00.449
you are dreaming!

30:21.211 --> 30:24.087
is there no limit
to this disobedience?

30:24.169 --> 30:27.878
Mark my words!
The reign of King Conroy is coming!

30:27.969 --> 30:32.358
My poor sister-in-law. What is the hold
that wicked man has over her?

30:33.847 --> 30:37.281
What about her uncle in Brussels?
Could he not be of assistance?

30:37.365 --> 30:41.834
King Leopold is as slippery
as a barrel full of eels.

30:41.923 --> 30:46.121
If he did dislodge Conroy, it'd only be
to tighten his own grip on the girl.

30:47.561 --> 30:51.554
Mightn't there be some benefit
if I pay Princess Victoria a visit

30:51.641 --> 30:55.427
before Conroy
has a chance to usurp her?

30:55.519 --> 30:58.554
Very well.

31:00.477 --> 31:05.070
Lord, in your mercy, get me past May!

31:06.474 --> 31:11.341
That way she'll be of age and we'll
have killed off the Regency at least.

31:14.832 --> 31:17.628
I tell you, Lord Melbourne,
his behaviour to me

31:17.710 --> 31:21.940
makes it impossible to keep him
in any post near my person.

31:22.028 --> 31:24.417
Any post whatever.

31:24.508 --> 31:28.897
You don't think it more dangerous
to cut him loose?

31:28.986 --> 31:33.343
I know things that mean
I could never have confidence in him.

31:33.426 --> 31:35.938
Now, I see I must endure Lady Flora.

31:36.024 --> 31:38.857
Mama cannot appear at Court
without a lady-in-waiting,

31:38.944 --> 31:40.933
but I draw the line at Conroy.

31:41.022 --> 31:44.253
And once I'm Queen, I do not wish
to look upon his face again.

31:44.342 --> 31:46.296
Well, we can't prevent the Duchess

31:46.380 --> 31:48.735
from keeping him
in charge of her own affairs.

31:48.820 --> 31:51.810
That will be her mistake, not mine.

31:54.018 --> 31:56.327
My dear Victoria, when i think...

32:00.415 --> 32:02.770
Dearest Victoria,
if ever you should need...

32:14.411 --> 32:18.448
What? Like a vulture? T o hover
at the edge until the King is dead?

32:18.529 --> 32:22.759
And, ma'am, you needn't worry.

32:22.847 --> 32:26.522
I'll be your private secretary.
For now, at least.

32:26.607 --> 32:29.438
Thank you, Lord Melbourne.
That is a great comfort to me.

32:29.525 --> 32:33.721
- Wenn er tot ist, dann gibt es mehr...
- Ernst! English, please!

32:33.803 --> 32:37.955
When he is dead, there'll be more
than one vulture to contend with.

32:38.043 --> 32:41.158
We should consider
the new appointments.

32:41.241 --> 32:43.709
Your ladies-in-waiting and so forth.

32:43.801 --> 32:47.792
Perhaps the Duchess of Sutherland
for Mistress of the Robes?

32:47.879 --> 32:49.517
Oh, I don't really know her.

32:49.599 --> 32:52.986
Ma'am, she's a dear friend of mine.
You'll enjoy her enormously.

32:53.076 --> 32:56.148
I should be lost without your guidance.

32:56.236 --> 33:00.113
- I hope you know how grateful I am.
- I'll draw up a list.

33:00.194 --> 33:02.310
What is it? Don't you like her?

33:02.394 --> 33:05.111
Yes, I like her.

33:05.192 --> 33:07.069
More than I dared hope.

33:07.152 --> 33:11.223
But it's not up to me, is it.
What do you call a man

33:11.310 --> 33:14.903
who waits for a rich woman to decide
whether or not she wants him?

33:24.786 --> 33:28.174
- Then, why not tell her how you feel?

33:34.862 --> 33:37.376
My dear Victoria,

33:37.462 --> 33:41.738
these days will be full of sadness
since i know the King is dear to you.

33:41.820 --> 33:46.494
Will you allow me to offer my support,
albeit at a distance?

33:46.578 --> 33:48.090
if i cannot be with you,

33:48.177 --> 33:52.691
then i pray you will hear my voice
in the music that i send.

33:52.775 --> 33:55.494
You know my love of Schubert.

33:55.575 --> 34:01.603
This is his "Swan Song".
And i play it with you in my heart.

34:01.693 --> 34:07.084
- Is he ready?
- Well, he may be, but she isn't.

34:08.688 --> 34:12.920
Let her enjoy succession
and the freedom it'll bring.

34:13.009 --> 34:18.956
We must wait for disillusion,
and the loneliness that follows.

34:39.599 --> 34:41.589
Victoria.

34:46.516 --> 34:48.507
You must come now.

35:08.108 --> 35:10.303
Long live the Queen.

35:26.382 --> 35:28.896
I'm going back to bed.

35:28.982 --> 35:31.858
I imagine Lord Melbourne
will be here quite early.

35:31.940 --> 35:37.172
Make sure he has everything he needs
if I am not ready to receive him.

35:37.259 --> 35:39.248
Of course, Your Royal...

35:40.777 --> 35:42.768
Your Majesty.

35:50.413 --> 35:53.450
Victoria, wait. I will hold your hand.

35:53.533 --> 35:55.205
No. Thank you, Mama.

35:55.293 --> 35:58.203
And, Lehzen, in the morning,
arrange for my bed to be moved

35:58.291 --> 35:59.883
into a room of my own?

35:59.971 --> 36:03.245
- Surely there's no need...
- As soon as possible, Lehzen.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.995
The Council is assembled,
Your Majesty.

36:59.110 --> 37:01.417
Her Majesty the Queen!

37:30.497 --> 37:32.852
It is with a sense
of reverence and honour

37:32.937 --> 37:35.849
that I address you,
my Privy Councillors,

37:35.937 --> 37:38.574
as your Sovereign and Queen.

37:40.655 --> 37:45.249
I mourn sincerely the death
of my dear uncle, the King,

37:45.333 --> 37:51.122
but I know I may count on you to serve
me as loyally as you served him.

38:00.089 --> 38:04.046
I am young, but I am willing to learn.

38:04.127 --> 38:08.038
And I mean to devote my life
to the service of my country

38:08.125 --> 38:10.593
and my people.

38:10.685 --> 38:13.595
I look for your help in this.

38:14.683 --> 38:17.913
I know I shall not be disappointed.

38:18.002 --> 38:19.797
Thank you.

38:24.998 --> 38:27.831
She starts on your watch,
Lord Melbourne.

38:27.918 --> 38:30.988
Guard her well
and keep her safe from harm.

38:52.309 --> 38:55.856
As a matter of interest, will a time
come when I read them first?

38:55.947 --> 39:00.097
You'll enjoy this.
She has a real flair for description.

39:00.665 --> 39:02.178
Present arms!

39:02.865 --> 39:07.220
Dearest Albert, on Tuesday,
i went to inspect Buckingham Palace.

39:07.303 --> 39:12.328
it is only just finished and i shall be
the very first sovereign to live there.

39:16.220 --> 39:17.970
As i stepped out of the carriage,

39:18.058 --> 39:22.609
for the first time in my life,
i felt freedom.

39:29.534 --> 39:32.332
- Splendid, is it not?
- Yes!

39:34.254 --> 39:37.005
You'll have to decide
on a husband soon.

39:37.092 --> 39:38.764
What about Leopold's candidate?

39:38.852 --> 39:41.161
I can't marry the man
they want me to marry.

39:41.250 --> 39:43.002
Oh!

39:43.090 --> 39:47.083
Every suitor
will come with strings attached.

39:47.170 --> 39:51.719
Can't I be my own mistress for a while?
Haven't I earned it?

39:51.808 --> 39:55.560
Dear Lord M, he's so very kind. I
couldn't have asked for a better tutor.

39:55.646 --> 39:58.877
You may dream of independence,
but you won't get it.

39:58.966 --> 40:02.877
From now on, everyone will push you
and pull you for their own advantage.

40:02.964 --> 40:05.680
Melbourne more than the rest.

40:05.761 --> 40:09.754
Just remember, you are the Queen,
he's a politician.

40:09.841 --> 40:13.878
And politicians, whatever their creed,
always resent a monarchy.

40:13.959 --> 40:17.074
They pass through. You stay.

40:17.157 --> 40:21.628
So just keep "dear Lord M"
in his proper sphere.

40:21.717 --> 40:24.752
He's already chosen the new household.

40:24.835 --> 40:27.269
About my ladies-in-waiting...

40:27.355 --> 40:32.063
Yes, I'll have a list brought
over later. They've all accepted.

40:32.153 --> 40:36.383
Only my aunt advised me not to be,
well, too partisan in my choice.

40:36.471 --> 40:38.826
With respect, Your Majesty,

40:38.911 --> 40:43.061
I think I understand these things at
least as well as the Queen Dowager.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.502
I know that, of course.

40:44.589 --> 40:48.626
And we want our friends around us,
of course, surely,

40:48.707 --> 40:50.902
as we begin our labours.

40:50.987 --> 40:55.342
We don't want to find Sir John Conroy
sneaking his feet back under the table.

40:55.425 --> 40:58.620
No. Not if we have to line up
every friend we both possess.

40:58.703 --> 41:03.492
Well, quite, ma'am. It's very cold
in here. Why haven't they lit the fires?

41:03.582 --> 41:06.890
It seems the fires are laid
by the Lord Steward's department,

41:06.980 --> 41:08.732
but lit by the Lord Chamberlain's,

41:08.820 --> 41:13.528
and no one knows which footmen
should do it. It's not very sensible.

41:13.618 --> 41:16.926
Well, if that's the way things are done,
I shouldn't meddle.

41:17.016 --> 41:19.610
We must improve where we can.

41:20.696 --> 41:23.288
If I've discovered anything
from touring England,

41:23.374 --> 41:25.569
it's the suffering that needs my help.

41:25.654 --> 41:27.565
Never try to do good, Your Majesty.

41:27.654 --> 41:30.166
- It always leads to terrible scrapes.

41:30.252 --> 41:33.961
Lord Melbourne, that is not
what is preached from the pulpit.

41:34.052 --> 41:35.961
No. That's why I never go to church.

41:36.050 --> 41:38.610
One always hears
the most extraordinary things.

41:52.324 --> 41:54.154
I've made no promise to him.

41:55.883 --> 41:59.157
But sometimes I feel
quite alone in the world.

41:59.241 --> 42:02.438
Never while I'm here, Your Majesty.

42:05.919 --> 42:09.036
Lord Melbourne is akin to a miracle.

42:09.119 --> 42:11.790
He has proved to be most generous
and sensitive,

42:11.877 --> 42:14.949
quite wondrous in a politician,

42:15.037 --> 42:17.265
someone i trust and hold dear.

42:17.355 --> 42:20.904
- He is the best company imaginable.

42:20.995 --> 42:25.191
Sometimes we laugh so much,
it's as if we were naughty children.

42:26.393 --> 42:30.669
Oh, Albert, i so look forward to the day
when you can know and value him

42:30.751 --> 42:32.628
as i do.

42:35.189 --> 42:37.862
Yours affectionately, Victoria.

42:41.787 --> 42:46.222
Plenty of praise for Lord Melbourne
and not much of anything else.

42:46.305 --> 42:52.172
- Everything comes to he who waits.
- And if nothing comes, what then?

42:52.262 --> 42:55.140
You've played with me, Baron.

42:55.222 --> 42:58.371
And now it is enough.
I'm going back to England.

42:58.460 --> 43:01.452
There must be a reason
if you wish to visit Her Majesty.

43:01.540 --> 43:04.336
Then find me a reason.

43:05.458 --> 43:07.369
ich will diesen...

43:09.856 --> 43:12.495
So, are you going to propose?

43:15.454 --> 43:19.242
What? What am I supposed to think?
You're going to enjoy the weather?

43:19.334 --> 43:21.926
I'm going to spend some time with her,
that's all.

43:23.412 --> 43:27.007
Besides, I am forbidden.

43:27.092 --> 43:29.809
It has to come from her, apparently.

43:29.890 --> 43:34.439
So I could not propose,
even if I wanted to.

43:35.528 --> 43:37.359
And do you want to?

43:51.161 --> 43:53.470
Walk on! Hup, hup!

44:01.519 --> 44:06.113
Please hold still. I'm afraid
I always find noses a challenge.

44:09.635 --> 44:12.069
Am I permitted to talk?

44:12.155 --> 44:14.544
Yes, but you can't move.

44:23.231 --> 44:26.109
There's nothing to rival
an English garden.

44:26.191 --> 44:30.068
Of all my life in Kensington,
it's the only part I'll miss.

44:30.149 --> 44:32.661
But the gardens at Buckingham Palace,
surely...

44:32.747 --> 44:35.658
- You're moving!
- Oh.

44:35.746 --> 44:38.135
Now you're smiling.

44:40.064 --> 44:45.136
Impossible!
You're worst than him!

44:49.102 --> 44:53.378
I believe we have a duty
to those in need of our protection.

44:53.460 --> 44:55.337
It is the business of every sovereign

44:55.420 --> 44:59.047
to champion the dispossessed,
for no one else will.

44:59.138 --> 45:02.412
Take housing. May I show you?

45:04.416 --> 45:06.327
Industry is expanding so fast

45:06.416 --> 45:10.487
that people are not considering
where the workers will live.

45:10.574 --> 45:13.930
But I've been experimenting.
By building these in units of two,

45:14.014 --> 45:20.008
you can build safe, clean homes for
two families for less than the cost...

45:21.010 --> 45:22.887
I'm sorry. I don't mean to preach.

45:22.970 --> 45:26.119
No, there's no need to apologise
for being passionate.

45:28.088 --> 45:30.476
It seems I have a lot to learn.

45:32.485 --> 45:34.282
With all my duties and...

45:34.365 --> 45:38.072
- And I do take them very seriously.
- I know you do.

45:38.163 --> 45:40.518
But plenty of people
will expect me to fail.

45:40.603 --> 45:43.276
And there are even more
trying to take advantage

45:43.363 --> 45:46.034
of my youth and inexperience.

45:46.121 --> 45:49.033
Then, they don't know you like I do.

45:52.639 --> 45:54.436
May I keep this?

46:06.955 --> 46:10.343
So, remember, the first thing
is to find an anchor point.

46:10.433 --> 46:13.584
So, take your hand back
to beneath your chin.

46:13.671 --> 46:16.139
Good. This is where
it will come every time.

46:16.231 --> 46:18.461
Now, release the bow.

46:18.551 --> 46:20.858
Your hand must cover the leather,
like this.

46:20.949 --> 46:23.383
And make a firm claw.
One finger, two fingers.

46:23.469 --> 46:27.254
- Claw.
- Yes, and back to beneath the chin.

46:27.346 --> 46:31.701
Bend this arm slightly.
Rotate to catch the arrow.

46:31.784 --> 46:33.263
Good.

46:33.344 --> 46:36.495
Very good. Now, try with an arrow.

46:46.740 --> 46:50.287
- Ah. He's still here?
- At my mother's insistence.

46:50.378 --> 46:52.289
Certainly not mine.

46:54.418 --> 46:56.247
Where am i to live?

46:56.336 --> 46:59.055
Am I to be abandoned here?

46:59.136 --> 47:01.329
Or am I to beg along the highways
for a crust?

47:01.414 --> 47:05.202
Come now. You will move
into the palace with the Queen.

47:05.294 --> 47:08.204
But she's arranged
a separate apartment for you.

47:08.292 --> 47:10.408
It will allow you both more privacy.

47:10.492 --> 47:14.642
I... I don't want privacy
from my own child!

47:14.730 --> 47:17.926
To exclude us will launch
the new reign in a cloud of scandal.

47:18.009 --> 47:20.680
I know your game, my lord.

47:20.767 --> 47:25.281
You want to be her father, her mother,
and who knows what else.

47:26.805 --> 47:29.319
If I'm not to be her private secretary,
then what?

47:29.405 --> 47:33.919
I'm sorry. I can see
that I am not speaking clearly.

47:35.203 --> 47:38.432
You have played the game and lost.

47:43.519 --> 47:45.555
The Prime Minister is here,
Your Majesty.

47:45.639 --> 47:47.675
Thank you, Duchess.

47:48.679 --> 47:51.475
Have I thanked you properly
for accepting the post?

47:51.557 --> 47:54.151
It will involve
a good deal of inconvenience.

47:54.237 --> 47:56.829
To be Mistress of the Robes
is a great honour.

47:56.915 --> 47:58.985
I'm only anxious to prove worthy of it.

47:59.075 --> 48:01.507
My Lord Melbourne
thinks you'll be perfect.

48:09.391 --> 48:11.621
How is Albert's visit going?

48:11.711 --> 48:16.498
He writes Victoria is under
Melbourne's control. He's frustrated.

48:16.588 --> 48:18.180
Then he must stay in England

48:18.268 --> 48:21.975
until the Queen thinks more of him
than she does of Melbourne.

48:22.066 --> 48:25.056
Queen Elizabeth never married.

48:25.144 --> 48:27.180
It didn't spoil things for her.

48:27.264 --> 48:31.540
Are you familiar with the Coronation
Chair and the ancient Stone of Scone?

48:31.622 --> 48:36.013
Familiar, yes,... but quite in awe.

48:36.102 --> 48:41.936
I'm terribly afraid of disappointing
on a day I so want to do it perfectly.

48:44.618 --> 48:49.007
Just be yourself. Your instincts
are always to your credit.

48:54.136 --> 48:57.206
I'm sorry. They're preparing
the Abbey for the ceremony.

48:57.294 --> 49:01.285
I'm told they asked permission
for a glimpse of Your Majesty.

49:01.372 --> 49:05.809
- Don't be sorry.
- God bless, Your Majesty.

49:07.609 --> 49:11.238
I do want to help them,
whatever you say.

49:11.329 --> 49:15.115
And not just the labouring poor,
but the hungry and the homeless.

49:15.247 --> 49:19.079
There are people who are lost. Whose
business is it to see to their welfare?

49:19.165 --> 49:24.112
Well, in my experience, it's best
to let these things develop naturally.

49:24.203 --> 49:26.876
If you interfere,
you risk overturning the cart.

49:26.963 --> 49:31.557
Prince Albert doesn't agree. He's made
a study of the working man's condition.

49:31.641 --> 49:34.518
He's full to the brim
with ideas for their improvement.

49:34.600 --> 49:38.307
Is he indeed? How inspiring.

49:38.398 --> 49:40.753
Well, good. He sounds like a young man

49:40.838 --> 49:43.350
ready to take charge
at the first opportunity.

49:53.792 --> 49:56.306
Then, you had better master
the rules of the game

49:56.392 --> 49:58.781
until you play it better than they can.

50:11.905 --> 50:14.817
Are you quite sure about that, ma'am?

50:17.385 --> 50:18.896
Make your move.

50:37.937 --> 50:39.928
Well?

50:46.695 --> 50:51.892
You may not accompany me
to the Proclamation Ceremony.

50:54.250 --> 50:57.242
You may not attend the Coronation.

51:10.846 --> 51:13.199
Perfect.

51:18.202 --> 51:22.955
- You're unprepared.
- No experience! Too young!

51:23.040 --> 51:25.713
Then, they don't know you like i do.

52:03.907 --> 52:08.183
Don't look so surprised.
The Queen has many different duties.

52:08.265 --> 52:12.700
It's heartening to see she won't
neglect them, even on Coronation Day.

52:12.783 --> 52:16.694
- I don't think Dash would allow it.
- Try to get some rest before the ball.

52:16.781 --> 52:21.013
I will. Since I firmly intend
to dance until dawn.

52:32.657 --> 52:34.964
Her Majesty the Queen.

53:05.273 --> 53:07.662
Are you sure this is wise?

54:51.435 --> 54:54.552
It's been quite a day. Are you tired?

54:54.635 --> 54:57.511
Oh, no.
Ah, well, not really. It's just...

54:57.593 --> 54:59.743
Well, I'm stronger than I look.

55:00.833 --> 55:04.141
- How much longer are you in London?
- Only until Friday.

55:04.231 --> 55:07.985
Then home via Brussels.
Uncle Leopold must have his report.

55:11.669 --> 55:15.023
Oh, dear. I have a quadrille
with the Prince of Prussia next.

55:15.107 --> 55:18.736
My poor little toes.
I feel sorry for them already.

55:19.947 --> 55:21.936
Your Majesty.

55:42.058 --> 55:44.809
I've had a letter from King Leopold.

55:44.896 --> 55:48.332
He proposes
extending this visit of Prince Albert.

55:48.416 --> 55:51.804
- And what have you answered?
- Nothing yet.

55:52.694 --> 55:55.208
Well, perhaps you should tell your uncle

55:55.294 --> 55:58.204
you need to focus
on your new duties right now.

56:08.528 --> 56:11.042
Thank you for being my messenger.

56:11.128 --> 56:14.562
I hope I've given my uncle enough
detail. Fill in anything I've missed.

56:14.646 --> 56:18.684
- He takes a great interest in you.
- Yes, don't I know it.

56:18.765 --> 56:22.153
You should see the questions
he asks by every letter.

56:22.243 --> 56:25.394
- Like a never-ending examination.

56:25.483 --> 56:28.951
Lord Melbourne calls him this...

56:29.041 --> 56:32.031
What about Lord Melbourne?

56:33.679 --> 56:34.873
Nothing.

56:36.279 --> 56:41.305
- The French Ambassador is here.
- Right. Erm...

56:42.437 --> 56:44.505
I wish you a good journey.

56:51.353 --> 56:53.423
Victoria?

56:54.393 --> 56:58.509
I would so like to be useful to you.

56:59.551 --> 57:01.701
If there is ever an opportunity.

57:01.789 --> 57:03.984
I know you would.

57:05.669 --> 57:07.942
But not yet.

57:42.096 --> 57:44.528
- Have you read this?

57:44.614 --> 57:46.605
No, sir.

57:49.652 --> 57:52.212
It seems
she does not think it appropriate

57:52.292 --> 57:56.249
to discuss politics in our otherwise
"delightful correspondence".

57:56.330 --> 57:59.925
- Which was dictated by Melbourne.
- Damn it!

58:01.608 --> 58:03.041
Do something!

58:03.128 --> 58:05.198
i can't get past Melbourne.

58:05.288 --> 58:10.723
Then get him past Melbourne!
Get him into her bed!

58:10.805 --> 58:14.034
My dear Victoria,
Uncle Leopold is full of ideas

58:14.123 --> 58:16.956
of how you and i may spend
more time together.

58:17.043 --> 58:21.273
And i must say i hope that some
of them, at least, will come to pass.

58:38.355 --> 58:41.392
Dear Albert,
you've been keeping secrets.

58:41.475 --> 58:44.624
When did you learn
to dance so beautifully?

58:44.713 --> 58:47.785
Lord M assures me
the next several months

58:47.873 --> 58:51.546
will be particularly gruelling
and busy for me as a new Queen.

58:51.631 --> 58:55.622
Thus, i am not certain
when i shall see you again.

58:58.149 --> 59:00.140
i look forward to your every letter,

59:00.229 --> 59:04.458
enjoying the detail of life in Germany,
and wishing to share more.

59:06.864 --> 59:09.936
- Waterloo might not...
- Yours affectionately, Victoria.

59:10.024 --> 59:14.254
Ah, this quite inoffensive little game
can turn into an effective weapon!

59:16.702 --> 59:19.737
Lord Melbourne says
French doctors kill their patients.

59:19.820 --> 59:23.210
- English ones just let them die.

59:23.300 --> 59:25.050
I thought he might be here tonight.

59:25.138 --> 59:27.698
He's thrown me over
for Lady Holland.

59:27.778 --> 59:31.974
- I expect Your Majesty will miss him.
- Not too severely. He's back tomorrow.

59:32.056 --> 59:34.695
No, no, no.
I meant when he's out of power.

59:34.776 --> 59:36.890
What?

59:37.814 --> 59:42.681
Well, only, I don't wish to crow, but...
I thought it was common knowledge

59:42.772 --> 59:45.764
that he's about to lose the vote.

59:53.130 --> 59:56.164
Schatzi?
I thought you were in your bedroom.

01:00:16.121 --> 01:00:17.713
Never mind.

01:00:17.801 --> 01:00:22.395
- Shh. Shh.

01:00:22.479 --> 01:00:25.389
- You won't desert me, will you?
- Never.

01:00:25.477 --> 01:00:27.513
Mein liebes Schatzi.

01:00:34.194 --> 01:00:37.468
Every one of your ladies is the wife
of a friend of Lord Melbourne.

01:00:37.552 --> 01:00:39.383
Surely you can see how that looks?

01:00:39.472 --> 01:00:42.507
You should not set such store
by appearances, Sir Robert.

01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:46.742
I only ask for a token. For two ladies,
even one, who supports my cause.

01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:50.820
Otherwise, it must seem as if
Palace and Parliament have fallen out.

01:00:50.907 --> 01:00:53.341
- I want to go in.
- I beg your pardon, ma'am.

01:00:53.427 --> 01:00:57.418
Her Majesty is with the Prime Minister
and cannot be disturbed.

01:00:57.505 --> 01:00:59.698
But that will not apply to her mother.

01:00:59.783 --> 01:01:02.172
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

01:01:03.263 --> 01:01:04.855
Let me understand you.

01:01:04.943 --> 01:01:08.490
Are you saying it is the Prime Minister
who selects my household?

01:01:08.581 --> 01:01:11.459
- Has the law changed in this regard?
- No, of course not.

01:01:11.539 --> 01:01:14.497
Well, then, there cannot be
much more to be said.

01:01:17.379 --> 01:01:21.973
- Good day, Sir Robert.

01:01:26.415 --> 01:01:29.723
Could you please ask Lady Portman
to come in as you leave?

01:01:30.893 --> 01:01:32.804
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:42.648 --> 01:01:45.720
I wonder if you could have a note
delivered to Lord Melbourne.

01:01:45.808 --> 01:01:47.478
Of course, ma'am.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:02.476
# What power...

01:02:02.562 --> 01:02:05.154
Mrs Melbourne!

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.639
# Art thou...

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.918
- Good God! What are we coming to?
- Who was it? I didn't see.

01:02:12.598 --> 01:02:19.035
The Duchess of Montrose. That's
the end to her career at Court, I hope.

01:02:20.836 --> 01:02:26.067
If I ban everyone who thinks me wrong,
you and I will be alone in the ballroom.

01:02:27.834 --> 01:02:30.949
- With sorrow, I must inform the House

01:02:31.032 --> 01:02:33.387
that I have been unable
to persuade the Queen

01:02:33.472 --> 01:02:37.860
that her ladies should not solely
adhere to the views of my opponents.

01:02:37.949 --> 01:02:41.144
- I have therefore informed Her Majesty

01:02:41.227 --> 01:02:43.536
that I am not qualified
to form a government,

01:02:43.627 --> 01:02:46.425
if I do not enjoy her confidence.

01:02:47.945 --> 01:02:51.494
Mr Speaker, are we to understand
that the great Sir Robert Peel

01:02:51.585 --> 01:02:54.939
has been frightened off
by a few frilly petticoats?

01:02:58.023 --> 01:02:59.977
Prime Minister!

01:03:00.061 --> 01:03:01.972
Mr Speaker, what frightens me

01:03:02.061 --> 01:03:05.176
is to see the Crown
used as a shuttlecock

01:03:05.259 --> 01:03:08.808
- in the game of politics!

01:03:08.899 --> 01:03:12.094
Which, apparently,
Lord Melbourne plays better than you!

01:03:12.177 --> 01:03:13.974
- Order!

01:03:14.057 --> 01:03:15.649
Constitutional crisis!

01:03:15.737 --> 01:03:19.728
Queen flouts Prime Minister!
Threat to bring down Tory government!

01:03:19.815 --> 01:03:21.931
- Order!
- Constitutional crisis!

01:03:22.015 --> 01:03:24.243
You should be
ashamed of yourself, sir.

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:26.722
If the Queen has been foolish,
she can plead youth.

01:03:26.813 --> 01:03:28.881
You are old enough to know better.

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:32.485
What troubles you is that Lord
Melbourne is Prime Minister again.

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:34.604
I do hate a bad loser.

01:03:34.688 --> 01:03:39.159
We are all losers in this, sir.
Most especially the Queen.

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:41.441
You have to understand you reign

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:44.324
by right of Parliament.
Work with the voters' choice.

01:03:44.406 --> 01:03:47.362
- Lord Melbourne says...
- He says what suits his interest.

01:03:47.444 --> 01:03:49.162
He has used you to punish his enemies

01:03:49.244 --> 01:03:51.474
without a thought
for the damage to the Crown.

01:03:51.564 --> 01:03:54.918
The Queen is in the clutches
of Melbourne, the great seducer!

01:03:55.002 --> 01:03:58.276
And when he is silent,
who does she listen to?

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.990
- Her German mother.
- I'm glad he thinks I listen to Mama.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:07.469
You are confusing stubbornness
with strength, my dear.

01:04:07.558 --> 01:04:10.548
And I warn you,
the people will not like you for it.

01:04:16.594 --> 01:04:19.552
She's brought down
a government over her ladies?

01:04:19.634 --> 01:04:22.271
- Apparently.
- Then she's a fool.

01:04:22.352 --> 01:04:25.866
No, she is not a fool.
But she has listened to a fool.

01:04:25.951 --> 01:04:28.907
Then she had better change her advisor.

01:04:28.989 --> 01:04:32.379
Or things will get worse
before they get better.

01:04:39.985 --> 01:04:43.375
- Open the door.

01:04:43.465 --> 01:04:45.613
"Not all the water
in the rough, rude sea

01:04:45.703 --> 01:04:49.537
can wash the balm off
from an anointed king. "

01:04:52.461 --> 01:04:54.179
"The breath of worldly men

01:04:54.261 --> 01:04:58.810
cannot depose the deputy
elected by the Lord. "

01:04:58.899 --> 01:05:01.652
- "For every man... "

01:05:01.739 --> 01:05:03.455
Sir John, what are you doing here?

01:05:03.537 --> 01:05:06.495
- I must speak to the Queen.
- You know that's impossible.

01:05:10.215 --> 01:05:13.605
"Welcome, my lord.
How far off lies your power?"

01:05:15.533 --> 01:05:18.650
An armed man
has been found in the gardens.

01:05:18.733 --> 01:05:21.881
- What?!
- He said he wished to harm the Queen.

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:25.804
".. discomfort guides my tongue
and bids me speak of nothing but... "

01:05:44.284 --> 01:05:48.480
They think I have interfered in matters
that do not concern me.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.876
It'll pass, ma'am, you'll see.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.868
My dear Victoria,
while these days may feel endless,

01:05:59.958 --> 01:06:03.551
please do not lose faith
in yourself or your people.

01:06:03.636 --> 01:06:05.786
We are all allowed to make mistakes,

01:06:05.876 --> 01:06:08.946
most especially when
we have looked to others for guidance.

01:06:10.434 --> 01:06:15.061
The storm still rages
outside the palace walls.

01:06:15.151 --> 01:06:18.188
i wonder now if everyone was right.

01:06:18.271 --> 01:06:23.468
Perhaps i am too young and
inexperienced for my position.

01:06:26.947 --> 01:06:29.586
Open your mind, examine your choices,

01:06:29.667 --> 01:06:32.657
and your honesty
will take you through the storm.

01:06:32.745 --> 01:06:35.817
i promise that you can do this work
and do it well.

01:06:35.905 --> 01:06:37.702
You have courage and heart

01:06:37.785 --> 01:06:41.412
and you said yourself
you're stronger than you look.

01:06:48.861 --> 01:06:50.929
A letter from your mother.

01:06:53.219 --> 01:06:55.050
My dearest child.

01:06:55.139 --> 01:06:57.697
You will not let me come to you,

01:06:57.777 --> 01:07:00.166
and that i may deserve,

01:07:00.257 --> 01:07:02.485
but however you resent me,

01:07:02.575 --> 01:07:07.773
however i have failed,
i am still and always your mother.

01:07:07.854 --> 01:07:10.764
What troubles you, troubles me.

01:07:10.852 --> 01:07:14.128
What pleases you, pleases me.

01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:15.848
i love you.

01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:21.207
And my only prayer is that one day
you will understand how much.

01:07:21.288 --> 01:07:25.201
Goodnight, mein Liebling.
Your own Mama.

01:07:35.604 --> 01:07:37.834
My dearest Albert.

01:07:37.924 --> 01:07:41.756
You asked me once
if you could be of help to me,

01:07:41.842 --> 01:07:48.393
and i so proud and confident
of my great powers replied, "Not yet".

01:07:50.918 --> 01:07:54.115
But since that day
so much has changed.

01:08:01.793 --> 01:08:04.785
I'm not forgiven yet.

01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:06.465
Not yet, but soon.

01:08:06.553 --> 01:08:09.668
Just wait for unseasonal weather
or the news of some elopement,

01:08:09.751 --> 01:08:11.787
and it'll all be forgotten.

01:08:11.871 --> 01:08:14.667
You don't have a very high opinion
of ordinary people,

01:08:14.749 --> 01:08:16.261
do you, Lord Melbourne?

01:08:17.549 --> 01:08:20.778
With respect,
I have lived longer than Your Majesty.

01:08:22.107 --> 01:08:23.620
I said once I didn't understand

01:08:23.707 --> 01:08:27.175
whose task it was
to see to the public welfare.

01:08:27.265 --> 01:08:30.939
Ma'am, in my lifetime,
I have seen with my own eyes,

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:33.173
what happens
when the rabble is empowered.

01:08:33.263 --> 01:08:34.776
Lord Melbourne.

01:08:34.863 --> 01:08:40.140
I want a report on living conditions,
on parish benefits,

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:44.814
housing, all of it.
And by the end of the month.

01:08:45.859 --> 01:08:51.055
And one more thing,... I have invited
Prince Albert for another visit.

01:08:51.136 --> 01:08:53.127
Very good, Your Majesty.

01:08:54.017 --> 01:08:58.166
When you get there, don't be a spy
or Uncle Leopold's puppet.

01:08:58.254 --> 01:09:00.643
It's your life, Albert. Live it.

01:09:00.734 --> 01:09:02.926
For yourself and for Victoria.

01:09:04.772 --> 01:09:07.158
Our uncle wouldn't thank you for that.

01:09:08.170 --> 01:09:09.966
I don't care.

01:09:16.608 --> 01:09:20.599
- I should have worn the red.
- You look beautiful, Your Majesty.

01:09:24.886 --> 01:09:30.435
His Serene Highness Prince Albert of
Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Your Majesty.

01:10:20.985 --> 01:10:23.101
I only just got your note.

01:10:24.105 --> 01:10:25.695
I was riding.

01:10:28.503 --> 01:10:30.095
Sit. Please.

01:10:40.339 --> 01:10:43.726
- The park is marvellous.
- I'm so pleased you like it.

01:10:44.736 --> 01:10:48.172
I do want you to feel quite at home.

01:10:51.334 --> 01:10:55.610
I'm sure you're aware
why I wished you to come here.

01:10:57.212 --> 01:11:00.010
Because it would make me happier
than anything,...

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:05.327
.. too happy, really,
if you would agree to what I wish.

01:11:05.410 --> 01:11:08.445
- And stay with you?
- And stay with me.

01:11:08.528 --> 01:11:12.758
- And marry you?
- And marry me.

01:11:43.114 --> 01:11:46.902
Wilt thou have this woman
to thy wedded wife?

01:11:47.912 --> 01:11:50.267
T o live together
after God's ordinance,

01:11:50.352 --> 01:11:55.265
- in the holiest state of matrimony?
- I will.

01:12:44.613 --> 01:12:47.171
Now I am quite married.

01:12:50.731 --> 01:12:53.243
- You know when we're old...
- Hmm.

01:12:54.569 --> 01:12:56.878
.. and surrounded by our children,...

01:12:58.969 --> 01:13:02.118
.. we will remember this
as the day our lives began.

01:13:02.207 --> 01:13:05.834
Not too surrounded, please.

01:13:11.443 --> 01:13:13.434
And not too soon.

01:13:14.403 --> 01:13:18.235
Oh? I should warn you that
I am expecting a very large family.

01:13:25.678 --> 01:13:28.670
- Good morning, wife.
- Good morning.

01:13:37.434 --> 01:13:39.345
Have you woken Her Majesty?

01:13:39.434 --> 01:13:42.185
- No, ma'am.
- Don't you think you should?

01:13:42.272 --> 01:13:45.264
No, ma'am. Not this morning, I don't.

01:13:52.628 --> 01:13:55.267
Let's take a little tour
and visit Scotland.

01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:59.100
I hear if any part of Britain is like
Germany, it's the Scottish Highlands.

01:13:59.186 --> 01:14:02.337
- Yes, we must one day.
- No. Straight away. Now.

01:14:02.426 --> 01:14:05.143
- Now?
- Only for a few weeks.

01:14:05.224 --> 01:14:08.182
You're a bride.
They can't expect you back before that.

01:14:08.264 --> 01:14:11.174
Dearest, I may be a bride
but I'm also a queen.

01:14:11.262 --> 01:14:14.652
I cannot be away
for more than three days at the most.

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.137
What are you doing?

01:14:20.219 --> 01:14:23.607
- Well, if we've only got three days...

01:14:25.417 --> 01:14:28.725
So tell me, will the weather
be this fine for all of the three days?

01:14:28.815 --> 01:14:30.612
Yes.

01:14:42.651 --> 01:14:44.926
Albert, where are you going?

01:14:59.445 --> 01:15:02.881
- Seriously, is it always like this?
- Yes!

01:15:55.426 --> 01:15:58.143
We will take care of each other,
won't we?

01:15:59.224 --> 01:16:00.418
Always.

01:16:21.655 --> 01:16:24.772
- How changeable they are.

01:16:26.015 --> 01:16:29.323
They hate you. They love you.
They hate you.

01:16:30.293 --> 01:16:33.488
They punished her,...
but they never hated her.

01:16:35.011 --> 01:16:40.242
And now she's a bride and back on top.
Until the next mistake.

01:16:42.769 --> 01:16:45.440
What on earth have I done with my life?

01:16:47.367 --> 01:16:50.404
I had many gifts, you know.

01:16:50.487 --> 01:16:53.875
As a boy, I was tipped for success.

01:16:56.765 --> 01:16:58.640
You have served me well.

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.194
What is that?

01:17:26.514 --> 01:17:31.427
Dear Albert, why haven't you
responded to my last two letters?

01:17:31.512 --> 01:17:34.468
i must be kept informed
of your progess.

01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:36.825
i need help. England's help.

01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:39.706
And you must and will secure it for me.

01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:42.860
Never forget
that you are first a Coburg.

01:17:42.948 --> 01:17:44.664
Your Uncle Leopold.

01:17:54.384 --> 01:17:58.772
- What is it?
- Just a question for Lord M.

01:17:59.661 --> 01:18:03.572
- Could I help?
- It'll keep.

01:18:17.335 --> 01:18:20.405
Why are these windows so dirty?
I can hardly see out.

01:18:20.493 --> 01:18:22.370
Same as the fires, I'm afraid.

01:18:22.453 --> 01:18:26.490
The departments can't agree to wash
inside and out at the same time.

01:18:26.571 --> 01:18:29.483
- Why don't we do something about it?
- I quite agree.

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:34.689
Because it's how things are done here.
And it's worked well for many years.

01:18:34.769 --> 01:18:37.488
Meanwhile, we live
in a filthy, freezing house.

01:18:37.569 --> 01:18:40.479
We live as guests of the Queen.

01:18:40.567 --> 01:18:44.604
Thank you, Baroness, for reminding me
that I am a guest here.

01:18:53.682 --> 01:18:55.638
Let him go.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.080
How is Albert settling in?

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.149
Why? What have you heard?

01:19:07.118 --> 01:19:10.426
He says he wants to reorganise
the way the palaces are run.

01:19:10.516 --> 01:19:13.076
Well then, for Heaven's sake, let him!

01:19:13.156 --> 01:19:15.543
He says
that Lord Melbourne controls me,

01:19:15.634 --> 01:19:17.989
and he says that Lehzen controls me.

01:19:18.074 --> 01:19:20.302
It seems everyone controls me
except him.

01:19:20.392 --> 01:19:25.022
A man who has no work
becomes ridiculous.

01:19:25.112 --> 01:19:29.900
And a poor man with a rich wife must
work twice as hard as anyone else.

01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:34.664
- Besides, you have chosen well.
- My Uncle William chose well.

01:19:34.748 --> 01:19:38.819
- You did not take on half his duties
- You don't know that.

01:19:38.906 --> 01:19:41.420
You don't know what I did.

01:19:53.941 --> 01:19:56.931
- What is this for?
- Your Royal Highness.

01:19:57.019 --> 01:20:01.169
The Red Room dinner service, sir.
For the officers guarding the King.

01:20:02.137 --> 01:20:06.813
- What king?
- King George lll, sir.

01:20:06.897 --> 01:20:08.772
And how often do we provide

01:20:08.855 --> 01:20:12.211
this dinner for a king
who has been dead for 20 years?

01:20:13.053 --> 01:20:14.725
Every night, sir.

01:20:19.091 --> 01:20:22.640
I cannot believe I'm being
subjected to this interrogation.

01:20:22.731 --> 01:20:26.278
You're not being subjected
to anything, Sir John.

01:20:26.369 --> 01:20:29.725
You have been in charge of the
Duchess's finances for many years.

01:20:29.809 --> 01:20:33.766
Indeed, you have made public
statements testifying to their health.

01:20:35.047 --> 01:20:37.434
- Yes, I have.
- I am so grateful.

01:20:37.525 --> 01:20:40.914
All I am asking is that you
will be so good as to tell us

01:20:41.004 --> 01:20:44.392
exactly where the money has gone?

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.711
Are you sure?

01:21:11.594 --> 01:21:13.548
- Congratulations, ma'am.

01:21:13.632 --> 01:21:15.782
Mein liebes Schatzi! I'm so happy.

01:21:18.272 --> 01:21:21.580
- Meine Liebling!
- Heavens, Mama, don't crush me.

01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:26.143
You'll let me know at once
if there's anything you need.

01:21:31.466 --> 01:21:33.456
You're not going already?

01:21:34.345 --> 01:21:37.380
I cannot leave too soon for my daughter.

01:21:37.463 --> 01:21:41.775
- Anyway, I have a lot on my mind.
- Something I could help with?

01:21:46.381 --> 01:21:48.290
Congratulations.

01:21:51.459 --> 01:21:53.336
Your Highness.

01:21:53.419 --> 01:21:56.568
There's your opening,
if you'll take my advice.

01:21:56.657 --> 01:21:58.852
Lord Melbourne, forgive me, but...

01:21:58.937 --> 01:22:02.974
you seem to have confused me
with a member of your club.

01:22:03.055 --> 01:22:07.205
I am not your drinking companion,
nor your whist partner.

01:22:07.293 --> 01:22:10.251
I am the husband of your sovereign.

01:22:10.333 --> 01:22:13.368
And as such,
I will make my own decisions,

01:22:13.451 --> 01:22:17.649
and I neither seek
nor invite your advice.

01:22:17.731 --> 01:22:19.720
Good evening.

01:22:23.769 --> 01:22:26.041
- So...

01:22:26.126 --> 01:22:29.402
- Are you discussing names?
- We're discussing the help.

01:22:29.486 --> 01:22:33.033
He writes that he'd prefer
not to talk politics in his letters,

01:22:33.124 --> 01:22:35.919
but only to discuss news of the family.

01:22:36.001 --> 01:22:38.231
I have planned this marriage
for 20 years!

01:22:38.321 --> 01:22:41.393
And now I'm supposed to accept
that I have failed?!

01:22:41.481 --> 01:22:45.597
On the contrary, Your Majesty,
we must accept it.

01:22:45.679 --> 01:22:47.668
The birds have flown.

01:23:18.067 --> 01:23:19.943
Your Majesty.

01:24:03.932 --> 01:24:06.125
I've been boring
Sir Robert and the Duke

01:24:06.210 --> 01:24:08.599
with my ideas for encouraging the Arts.

01:24:08.690 --> 01:24:11.441
Hmm. Does Sir Robert
care for such frivolity?

01:24:11.528 --> 01:24:13.246
I have many interests, ma'am.

01:24:13.328 --> 01:24:15.921
And my government
would support the Prince's plans.

01:24:16.007 --> 01:24:18.758
Your government?
What government is this?

01:24:18.845 --> 01:24:23.633
If I should be fortunate enough
to form another government, ma'am.

01:24:23.723 --> 01:24:28.001
And when he does, there'll be
no repeat of the old problem.

01:24:28.083 --> 01:24:31.118
Some of your ladies have
already agreed to resign.

01:24:31.201 --> 01:24:34.908
And Sir Robert will ask for
no more change than that.

01:24:38.039 --> 01:24:40.030
Thank you, Sir Robert.

01:24:48.395 --> 01:24:51.910
How dare you speak to me in that way
before them.

01:24:52.873 --> 01:24:57.105
How dare you... talk across me,
as if I were a child.

01:24:57.193 --> 01:25:00.900
- I... I did no such thing.
- Oh, no?

01:25:00.991 --> 01:25:03.664
Well, you've sorted this,
you've sorted that.

01:25:03.751 --> 01:25:05.387
You and Sir Robert.

01:25:05.469 --> 01:25:07.699
You and the Duke.
All without reference to me!

01:25:07.789 --> 01:25:11.415
- Victoria, I thought you'd be pleased.
- I will tell you what you thought.

01:25:11.506 --> 01:25:13.576
You thought that I was a woman!

01:25:13.666 --> 01:25:17.703
To be petted
and passed over and ignored!

01:25:17.784 --> 01:25:22.253
Would it were so simple then we might
avoid more scandals of your making.

01:25:22.342 --> 01:25:25.140
- Have you lost your mind?!
- Do you wonder at it?

01:25:25.222 --> 01:25:29.532
Less than three years on the throne
and you and your precious Melbourne

01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:32.293
have pushed this monarchy
to the brink of an abyss!

01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:34.528
I've told you before and I will again,

01:25:34.618 --> 01:25:37.371
you are my husband here,
and that is all!

01:25:37.458 --> 01:25:42.814
- And that is quite enough, believe me!
- I will not have my role usurped!

01:25:42.896 --> 01:25:44.215
I wear the crown.

01:25:44.296 --> 01:25:47.889
Any mistakes will be my mistakes,
and no one else will make them.

01:25:47.974 --> 01:25:50.363
No one! Not even you!

01:25:55.692 --> 01:25:58.887
I'm leaving before you excite
yourself and harm the child.

01:25:58.970 --> 01:26:01.359
You will go when I dismiss you.

01:26:02.969 --> 01:26:06.403
I am your Queen
and I am telling you to stay.

01:26:08.247 --> 01:26:10.361
Goodnight, Victoria.

01:26:11.285 --> 01:26:13.879
You may not go. You may not go!

01:26:13.965 --> 01:26:18.036
I order you to stay here in this room!
Albert!

01:26:24.481 --> 01:26:26.392
Guard, royal salute!

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:28.470
Present arms!

01:26:43.915 --> 01:26:46.427
There is no need
for you to accompany me.

01:26:46.513 --> 01:26:49.027
I said I would and so I will.

01:26:49.113 --> 01:26:51.104
Walk on. Hup!

01:27:06.746 --> 01:27:10.214
For pity's sake smile, woman.
Anyone would think we'd quarrelled.

01:27:10.304 --> 01:27:11.703
Don't talk to me.

01:28:43.793 --> 01:28:47.942
There's nothing more I can do here.
The Prince needs rest.

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:50.699
Your Majesty.

01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:05.495
I'm so sorry!

01:29:08.024 --> 01:29:11.014
I thought I was going to lose you!

01:29:11.982 --> 01:29:16.178
- He was not a very good shot.
- Why did you do it?

01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:19.252
You're so stupid! Why did you do it?

01:29:21.538 --> 01:29:23.927
I had two very good reasons.

01:29:24.898 --> 01:29:28.127
First, I am replaceable
and you are not.

01:29:28.216 --> 01:29:31.968
- You are not replaceable to me.
- Shh.

01:29:32.054 --> 01:29:38.048
Second,... you are the only wife
I've got or ever will have.

01:29:38.811 --> 01:29:44.008
You are my whole existence. And
I will love you until my last breath.

01:29:59.365 --> 01:30:01.356
We're told the man was mad.

01:30:02.443 --> 01:30:04.832
Is that reassuring? I can't decide.

01:30:06.323 --> 01:30:08.312
May I be honest, ma'am?

01:30:10.081 --> 01:30:13.153
- Even a politician can be sometimes.

01:30:14.959 --> 01:30:19.747
My guidance...
hasn't always been faultless,...

01:30:20.997 --> 01:30:23.386
.. and I'm sorry for it.

01:30:25.437 --> 01:30:28.871
- But I speak now as a true friend.
- I know.

01:30:31.275 --> 01:30:36.266
The Prince is a good man.
A better man than any of us knew.

01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:43.386
I know he does not think as well of me.
My vanity is not the issue here.

01:30:44.148 --> 01:30:46.025
He is able.

01:30:46.108 --> 01:30:47.826
He is clever.

01:30:48.588 --> 01:30:50.383
And he's faithful.

01:30:52.306 --> 01:30:54.183
Let him share your work.

01:31:03.262 --> 01:31:06.971
There is one task more
Your Majesty must face,...

01:31:07.062 --> 01:31:09.858
if the Prince
is to feel truly welcome here.

01:31:15.418 --> 01:31:18.216
I needed her so much as a child.

01:31:32.891 --> 01:31:36.167
I hope you don't mind,
I had your desk brought in.

01:31:39.449 --> 01:31:43.281
- Don't I have a say in this?
- No!

01:32:09.119 --> 01:32:12.632
- Good morning, wife.
- Good morning.

01:33:37.646 --> 01:33:41.762
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.
Her Majesty the Queen.

01:34:50.461 --> 01:34:52.531
# My love

01:34:53.499 --> 01:34:55.296
# Your love

01:34:55.379 --> 01:35:00.326
# Has opened up a world
i've never known

01:35:02.576 --> 01:35:04.692
# All hope

01:35:05.534 --> 01:35:07.445
# Was found

01:35:07.534 --> 01:35:11.810
# A place i never dreamed i would go

01:35:13.372 --> 01:35:16.444
# Feels like only yesterday

01:35:16.532 --> 01:35:19.966
# i had locked my heart away

01:35:20.050 --> 01:35:23.927
# Safe behind a castle of stone

01:35:26.008 --> 01:35:29.078
# Sure i'd always be alone

01:35:29.166 --> 01:35:34.081
# Only you

01:35:34.166 --> 01:35:36.883
# Know how

01:35:40.922 --> 01:35:46.517
# To hear me through

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:49.319
# The silence

01:35:53.078 --> 01:35:57.867
# You reach a part of me

01:35:57.957 --> 01:36:04.144
# That no one else can see

01:36:04.235 --> 01:36:07.305
# Forever true

01:36:07.393 --> 01:36:10.271
# There's only me

01:36:10.351 --> 01:36:12.865
# And only you

01:36:16.151 --> 01:36:18.424
# Only me and you

01:36:24.027 --> 01:36:27.144
# in your faith

01:36:27.227 --> 01:36:29.420
# i trust

01:36:29.505 --> 01:36:33.817
# With you beside me
i am standing strong

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:38.937
# One truth

01:36:39.023 --> 01:36:41.330
# Two hearts

01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:45.858
# You took my life
and made it beautiful

01:36:47.219 --> 01:36:49.813
# So you dare to let me shine

01:36:49.899 --> 01:36:53.605
# Even walk a step behind

01:36:53.696 --> 01:36:58.165
# Willingly you give yourself to me

01:36:59.774 --> 01:37:02.766
# Knowing who i was born to be

01:37:02.854 --> 01:37:07.801
# Only you

01:37:07.892 --> 01:37:10.802
# Know how

01:37:14.850 --> 01:37:20.480

# Forever true

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.468
