WEBVTT

00:01.377 --> 00:02.627
-Ooh, hey.
-Hey.

00:02.711 --> 00:04.379
Hollywood's biggest night, huh?

00:04.463 --> 00:06.589
-Mmm-hmm.
-What'd you put down for best foreign?

00:06.882 --> 00:08.800
You know me, man.
Just put down the Danish one,

00:09.009 --> 00:10.635
trying to keep it Scandinavian, so.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.679
Oh, man, I hope tonight tops last year

00:12.763 --> 00:14.722
because I really feel that it was just
a bunch of people, like,

00:14.807 --> 00:16.474
I don't know, sucking each other off, really.

00:16.558 --> 00:17.642
-Yeah.
-On the red carpet.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.228
-It kind of was.
-Yeah, it was, like, one big circle jerk, right?

00:20.312 --> 00:22.814
-Yep.
-Ooh, Adam, Adam, it's starting!

00:22.940 --> 00:24.774
-It's starting!
-Who's hungry?

00:24.858 --> 00:28.277
--All right, that looks great.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.904
Tittay.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.198
Welcome to the AVN Awards Show,

00:32.282 --> 00:35.201
where we honor the best
in adult entertainment.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.829
Who do you guys got for best MMF-DP-ATM?

00:38.080 --> 00:39.956
-Um...
-Who did I mark?

00:40.082 --> 00:41.416
Gianna.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.542
Yep, and I got Chloe.

00:46.463 --> 00:47.588
I'm fresh

00:49.299 --> 00:50.591
You gotta, you gotta
You gotta, gotta

00:51.343 --> 00:52.802
Gotta be fresh

00:55.013 --> 00:57.348
Adam, I can't believe you got
every category right.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.308
Dude, you even guessed best dong-umentary.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.729
Yes, well, 12 Inches a Slave was a no-brainer,

01:02.938 --> 01:06.482
but I'll admit it, having a
pornographic memory doesn't hurt.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.109
I cannot forget a dick.

01:08.193 --> 01:11.028
Which is crazy, 'cause you
can't remember anything else, right?

01:11.155 --> 01:13.072
Yeah, no, I can't remember
what I ate for breakfast.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.825
I can't remember, like,
my social security number,

01:15.909 --> 01:19.662
which is an issue sometimes,
but I remember, like, every frame

01:19.872 --> 01:22.665
of the porno that
I cranked down to in the mirror last night.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.709
Did you just say you crank
down in the mirror?

01:25.461 --> 01:26.586
You guys don't crank down in the mirror?

01:26.670 --> 01:28.004
Okay, I'll teach you something.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.047
All right, so you are the mirror.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.174
-Uh-huh.
-Okay?

01:31.258 --> 01:32.842
And this, right here, the screen, that's where

01:32.926 --> 01:35.136
all the porno's happening.
So I put a little porno

01:35.220 --> 01:37.013
back here and I look in the mirror,

01:37.139 --> 01:38.389
and it's like I'm in the porno.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.933
It's like a pop porno.
And then I'm looking at myself

01:41.018 --> 01:44.437
at the same time, and going like,
"You're having fun, this is fun. Look at you."

01:44.521 --> 01:46.647
-Sure.
-Seems like a lot of work, but very cool.

01:46.732 --> 01:47.774
It's not.

01:47.858 --> 01:50.026
I like to just squeeze it till it pops
and move on, you know?

01:50.110 --> 01:51.360
It's not, it's not a lot.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.446
It's a little overwhelming
for me, so, if we could,

01:53.530 --> 01:54.655
-if you wouldn't mind...
-Absolutely.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.073
I'd like to ask you about the giant bag

01:56.200 --> 01:57.366
you brought to work. What's up with that?

01:57.493 --> 01:59.869
Hello, it's my costume bag
from my theater days.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.954
-Uh-oh.
-When we were watching the AVN Awards

02:02.039 --> 02:04.916
it kind of got the old actor juices a-flowin'.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.043
I had different juices flowing.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.003
-Semen.
-Me too.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.880
Do you remember Sydney,

02:11.131 --> 02:12.799
the Australian tour guide?

02:12.883 --> 02:14.801
-I do.
-Good day, mate.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.720
Oh, and crikey, is that a didgeridoo?

02:17.888 --> 02:19.305
- What the hell are you doing?
- Huh?

02:19.389 --> 02:22.099
Anders, I got a mission for you, Stretch.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.602
-Uh, ma'am, yes, ma'am.
-I'm sending you

02:24.770 --> 02:26.312
to the North Rancho College job fair to recruit

02:26.396 --> 02:28.272
-some new employees.
-Wow, okay.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.650
Grab a couple of people
to help you get contact info

02:30.734 --> 02:32.360
on 100 people interested in working here.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.403
You got it. I will assemble my team right now.

02:34.780 --> 02:35.947
Great.

02:37.074 --> 02:40.576
We going back to college,
we going back to college!

02:40.661 --> 02:42.161
--Yes, yes.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.664
Not so fast, guys. Okay?

02:44.748 --> 02:47.416
My career here at TAC is clearly riding on this,

02:47.751 --> 02:50.044
and you two? On a college campus?

02:50.921 --> 02:52.046
Not happening.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.090
Attention, TelAmericans,

02:54.216 --> 02:57.927
tomorrow morning at 0900 hours,
we will deploy onto the campus

02:58.053 --> 02:59.929
of North Rancho College,

03:00.013 --> 03:02.765
trying to get 100 sigs of some fresh meat.
Who's with me?

03:03.100 --> 03:04.308
Bill, Tez?

03:04.434 --> 03:06.352
You boys up for an excellent adventure?

03:06.562 --> 03:09.397
And miss out on my commissions?
Fool, please.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.440
I'm trying to ball out at this
hookah bar this weekend.

03:12.776 --> 03:13.776
Tsh!

03:13.861 --> 03:15.695
-Ders... Come on.
-Please take us.

03:15.779 --> 03:16.737
-Stop.
-I'm not going to stop.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.281
Stop him. Please stop him.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.782
I'm not going to stop until you take us.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.617
I know you guys, all right? You're gonna, like,

03:21.869 --> 03:24.036
basically show up and then
I'm going to do all the work

03:24.121 --> 03:25.204
and you're going to run off, and I'm going

03:25.289 --> 03:26.247
to be alone doing all the work.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.040
Honestly, I swear on my mother

03:28.125 --> 03:30.710
and Blake's entire family
that we will not bail on you.

03:30.794 --> 03:31.878
Fine!

03:31.962 --> 03:33.379
-Yes.
-Yes, all right.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.215
All right. Hey, guys, check this out.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.218
-Whoa, nice.
-Cool, right?

03:39.303 --> 03:41.888
-Whoa, very cool.
-Yeah, I figured we could do

03:41.972 --> 03:44.724
a whole thing where it's, like,
"Come and join the TelAmerican army."

03:44.808 --> 03:46.559
-Mmm-hmm.
-And got a little karaoke machine

03:46.810 --> 03:48.561
so we could sing some songs. I'm thinking

03:48.645 --> 03:51.939
Proud to be a TelAmerican or
TelAmerica the Beautiful.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.232
-Ooh, I got one, I got one.
-Yeah?

03:53.317 --> 03:54.275
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here we go.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.027
- Start it off.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.278
Neither!

03:57.362 --> 03:59.488
That's good, here, I'll do the second verse.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.073
Fug this shib.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.618
Very stupid, very dumb idea

04:03.994 --> 04:05.995
We're not going to do your
stupid sign-up job,

04:06.121 --> 04:07.830
because you said that we'd blow you off.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.582
-That's right.
-Mmm-hmm.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.959
Right. And that's what you're doing right now.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.669
-We are.
-Yes, we are doing that,

04:13.754 --> 04:15.212
-but only because...
-Exactly.

04:15.339 --> 04:16.881
-You started it.
-But you're doing it.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.257
No, but you started it. You were a jerk,

04:18.342 --> 04:20.051
and you blew us off and you
said we weren't gonna help you,

04:20.177 --> 04:21.636
so now we're not going to.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.845
And we would've done really well, too.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.722
We would've, like, worked our balls off.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.599
This is exactly why I didn't
want to bring you guys.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.893
Come on, dude, let's go throw
the boomerang in the quad.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.519
Mmm-kay. Hey, Blake?

04:30.687 --> 04:31.812
-Mmm-hmm?
-Real quick, what's, like, a cool

04:31.897 --> 04:33.856
Australian exit line that I could say?

04:34.107 --> 04:35.816
Oh, um...

04:38.570 --> 04:39.820
Freakin' crikey.

04:41.365 --> 04:42.782
-That was really good.
-All right, okay.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.034
-This is a big campus, huh?
-Yeah.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.411
Getting, like, weird vibes though.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.622
It's like full-body déjà vu.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.589
Dorm Daze.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.718
This is the college campus where they shot
24 of my 36 favorite college pornos.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.053
This is it!

05:04.554 --> 05:06.055
-Whoa.
-That's the vibe.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.473
That's why I was getting that vibe.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.141
Oh. Okay, okay, that's awesome, man.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.060
Now, hey, go long, mate.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.728
I want to toss you the boomer, huh?

05:13.355 --> 05:14.772
I've got to find the dorm room where

05:14.940 --> 05:18.150
they shot the gang bang sequences,
pay my respects.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.986
Come on, dude. Go long.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.654
I... I can't throw the boomerang to myself.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.156
Pretty sure that's how they work, Blake.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.742
Yeah, I know how boomerangs work, Adam.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.786
I just want somebody to watch me

05:28.870 --> 05:31.455
-while I throw the boomerang.
-Sorry, Blake.

05:32.749 --> 05:36.252
I've got to find porno! Whoo!

05:36.586 --> 05:40.673
TelAmeriCorp, TelAmeriCorp

05:40.799 --> 05:44.260
Come make phone calls with me

05:45.220 --> 05:47.263
Come on and join the TelAmerican army,

05:47.347 --> 05:49.265
where the front line is the landline.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.684
It's phones. You just make
phone calls all day.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.769
-Hey, army man.
-Yeah?

05:53.895 --> 05:56.272
Do you take requests?

05:56.565 --> 05:59.108
Because I request you take that
mic and shove it up your ass.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.609
Get some.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.029
Well, who are you guys? What have we got?
Oh, US Coast Guard!

06:03.196 --> 06:04.488
Cool, I get it.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.742
'Cause you guys coast on the backs
of the people who really guard our country.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.829
Oh, my God, did one of you guys just fart?

06:12.080 --> 06:13.581
'Cause it smells like salty dick.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.710
Whoo. I'm downwind.

06:17.878 --> 06:21.380
Uh, you guys want to see
my impression of the Navy?

06:24.342 --> 06:27.303
And here's my impression
of the US Coast Guard.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.222
- Ah!

06:30.348 --> 06:32.183
Brock! Brock, back.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.726
Okay. Yeah, sign up, man.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.395
Just need your name, email, phone number

06:36.521 --> 06:37.563
and a stool sample.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.981
Just kidding, I'm not the Coast Guard.

06:45.989 --> 06:49.992
To be or not to be, that is the question.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.161
Whether 'tis nobler...

06:52.245 --> 06:55.664
Doth my eyes hear a fellow thespian?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.793
-Or to take pause...
-Thank you.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.836
Do we have anyone else reading for Hamlet?

07:01.129 --> 07:02.421
One more!

07:02.589 --> 07:03.881
-Get on with it.
-Thanks.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.928
Okay, before I start, this boomerang has,
like, knife edges.

07:10.222 --> 07:12.848
Back off, easy.

07:15.685 --> 07:20.564
Yah! Yah! Yah!

07:21.024 --> 07:24.610
Back up! All right, I'm not from here.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.655
I'm from a goddamn prison colony!

07:27.781 --> 07:31.367
So unless you want a little bit
of what he just got...

07:31.535 --> 07:33.786
I'm sorry, what scene are you doing?

07:34.287 --> 07:37.123
This is from Crocodile
Dundee 4: The New Class.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.582
It's an original script.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.334
And are you even a student here?

07:40.502 --> 07:41.836
Not technically, sir, no.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.131
But I will do anything to be a star.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.092
You are a very bad actor.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.220
And we would never use you in a production.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.306
--Hey.

07:54.516 --> 07:57.017
Hey, what you did up there was so brave.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.520
The director had no idea
what he was talking about.

07:59.813 --> 08:03.190
Well, I mean, I just did what
Dundee would've done-dood.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.860
Well, you know, my friends and I are making

08:05.944 --> 08:08.237
this really cool short film today.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.906
We could use a real actor like you.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.992
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.745
Do you think you could use
an Aussie in the cast?

08:16.913 --> 08:19.373
-I do 13 unique characters...
-Okay, come on.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.457
That... All right.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.043
Eighteen? No.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.389
I'm finally home.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.320
Something isn't right.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.907
This is the room...

08:53.158 --> 08:54.950
But it's not the room.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.494
Did they move the walls?

08:58.121 --> 09:01.457
Nope. That'd be physically impossible.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.719
Uh, no.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.012
Doesn't make sense.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.307
In order for semen spray to land here,

09:19.643 --> 09:21.769
the buster would have to shoot from here.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.441
But Eric was over there.

09:27.651 --> 09:29.026
And he didn't even bust.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.282
Was there a second semen sprayer?

09:37.285 --> 09:38.577
No. Nope.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.789
Start from the beginning, Adam.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.335
Who the fuck are you?

09:46.962 --> 09:48.170
Is this where the porno was?

09:48.505 --> 09:49.838
I don't know what you're talking about, man.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.590
Just... Just get out of here.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.259
You know what?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.010
I believe you.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.929
I don't see porno in your eyes.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.306
Sorry, I'm going to have to look around first.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.769
Female sex.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.272
That's code word for porn.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.774
Hey, who wants to be the 100th contact

10:08.858 --> 10:10.609
given to TelAmeriCorp? Hook a brother up.

10:11.486 --> 10:12.945
The Coast Guard, what's going on?

10:13.029 --> 10:14.863
Wait a second, if you guys are here,

10:14.948 --> 10:16.240
who's doing nothing on the boat?

10:18.451 --> 10:20.411
'Cause, you guys, I don't know
what you do. What do you guys

10:20.495 --> 10:21.537
even do? Do you have boats?

10:21.663 --> 10:24.123
Yeah, we get it.
Yeah, no, you're a regular Gabriel Iglesias.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.250
I wouldn't say that. Fluffy's very talented.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.961
You really shouldn't make jokes about
the military like that.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.296
Okay.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.464
What are you guys gonna do,
give me a Code Red?

10:34.217 --> 10:35.342
Actually not a bad idea.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.554
Come on, guys, please. Don't do this.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.139
Oh, no, man.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.891
Nothing like the taste of
Code Red on a hot day, am I right?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.519
My butt hairs are all fizzy now.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.022
I think Officer Pettytailwags
is looking a little thirsty.

10:48.523 --> 10:50.691
What? Who's Officer Pettytailwags?

10:50.775 --> 10:52.901
That's not good. That's not good.
That's not good.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.903
That's not... Bad.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.280
-Here we go...
-Ah!

10:56.573 --> 10:57.948
Okay.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.075
Normally we spend our shore leave fucking.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.745
Not teaching manners to phone jockeys.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.830
Come on, Lance.

11:05.457 --> 11:09.918
And so, at this point,
the patriarchy is so deeply

11:10.045 --> 11:13.589
ingrained in modern society,
females are portrayed

11:13.798 --> 11:15.966
almost exclusively as sex objects.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.426
Sex objects.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.386
She talking about dildos, or what?

11:19.804 --> 11:21.096
Is there a problem, young man?

11:21.431 --> 11:23.515
No, I just saw this hot chick
walk in with a book that said

11:23.600 --> 11:26.935
"Sex" and I figured she was
leading me to the porno room,

11:27.062 --> 11:28.937
- but...

11:29.439 --> 11:31.857
Young man, would you come down
here to the front of the room

11:32.025 --> 11:34.026
and let us ask you some questions?

11:34.444 --> 11:36.779
Oh, hell yeah, bitch. Cool.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.655
All right, this is fun.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.742
Damn, girl, you got some sweater meats
up there.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.868
Fascinating.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.454
Did you see how he wasn't able to take

11:45.538 --> 11:48.415
more than just a few steps without
talking about sex?

11:48.917 --> 11:52.419
It's really as if he has no control
over his base desires.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.296
I didn't know I was going to
be in a room full of freakin'

11:54.422 --> 11:59.301
hot young Mileys or else I probably
would've worn my big dick jeans!

12:04.057 --> 12:05.057
He's insane!

12:07.519 --> 12:09.186
You gotta
you gotta be fresh

12:09.479 --> 12:10.979
So this is our set.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.898
It's, you know, pretty low-budget,

12:12.982 --> 12:14.733
but I think it's going to turn out really cool.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.236
Wow. Okay, pinch me, am I dreaming?

12:17.487 --> 12:20.197
This is awesome.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.658
So what's the scene, mate?

12:23.618 --> 12:25.160
Well, we improvise most of it.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.871
Oh, okay,
all right, The League-ing it.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.125
Very smart. So do you guys work off of,
like, an outline or...

12:31.459 --> 12:33.544
Well, this is Landon, the director.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.796
Hey, how are you, Blake? Nice to meet you.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.506
You ready to make a movie today?

12:38.007 --> 12:39.091
You betcha, sir.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.802
So tell me, Adam, what is it
you like about porn?

12:43.513 --> 12:45.347
To begin with, um...

12:45.557 --> 12:46.807
Everything.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.852
Not to be, like, sentimental and cheesy, but...

12:50.687 --> 12:52.354
I love how they just...

12:52.772 --> 12:55.524
Their soft cupping of the balls,

12:56.985 --> 13:00.028
and the general way they just
caress the shaft and...

13:01.406 --> 13:03.031
All the gagging.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.701
It's just beautiful to me.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.537
Well, Adam, I have some bad news for you.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.915
Those women are being exploited.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.461
-Nope.
-No, it's true.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.880
Many of them are confused, young actresses

13:18.006 --> 13:19.381
hoping to be in a movie.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.718
Red leather, yellow leather.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.804
-Right, here we go, have some acting juice.
-Oh, oh, are you kidding me?

13:25.972 --> 13:27.681
They're offered drugs and alcohol

13:27.891 --> 13:29.266
to lower their inhibitions.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.809
They're victims, Adam.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.811
So, nobody's told me, like, what the scene is.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.646
I know we're 'prov-ing it, she told me.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.523
-Well, I'll tell you what.
-Uh-huh.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.609
The scene is sit down right about here.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.402
-Uh-huh.
-And then Crystal

13:40.487 --> 13:41.945
is gonna gobble your knob.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.824
Shall we maybe do the scene before, though?

13:45.909 --> 13:47.367
Like, when we, like meet each other, like...

13:47.911 --> 13:49.161
No, we're good. All right?

13:49.245 --> 13:50.329
Okay. Yeah.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.207
Sad victims of a dark industry that caters

13:53.291 --> 13:55.584
to perverted misogynists.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.419
Sorry, don't talk about porno like that.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.755
It's, like, fun. And we're ever...
They're all having fun.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.382
We're not going to show the actual, um...

14:02.967 --> 14:05.302
- My penis, are we?
- They manipulate women

14:05.428 --> 14:09.056
emotionally to make them
think they have no choice.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.226
What's the matter, you don't like sex?

14:12.310 --> 14:15.729
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do. It's just, um...

14:16.272 --> 14:17.606
You know what? I should go.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.775
Hear my mom calling me. I gotta go.
I'm so sorry.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.777
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell, man?

14:22.153 --> 14:23.862
You drink my booze, you smoke my weed

14:23.947 --> 14:25.030
and now you want to fucking leave?

14:25.114 --> 14:26.406
-I don't think so, man.
-All right.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.200
Hey, stop yelling at me!

14:28.451 --> 14:30.410
All right? I just want to act!

14:30.787 --> 14:32.454
I just want to act, okay?

14:32.539 --> 14:35.457
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Don't be mad, all right?

14:36.626 --> 14:39.586
They break these women down
to get what they want.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.923
-That's how they get them.
-You're in the big time now.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.841
You're gonna act
and you don't want to disappoint

14:44.926 --> 14:46.552
all these people, do you? Everybody's here

14:46.678 --> 14:47.970
working hard to make you look good.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.140
Why don't you take this and use that closet

14:52.267 --> 14:54.893
to grease up your hog and then
you get your shit together

14:54.978 --> 14:56.311
and we'll make some movies.

14:56.479 --> 14:57.604
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:57.772 --> 15:00.357
-Stop it, you're scaring me.
-Good, you should be scared.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.776
What if your mother was in this situation?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.989
My mommy doesn't make porno,
she makes ham sammiches.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.284
But porn stars are women, just like your mom.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.995
So some porn stars are...

15:14.831 --> 15:16.915
Done from a long day on set
and they go home

15:17.000 --> 15:18.292
and make a little boy ham sammiches?

15:18.668 --> 15:20.085
Yes, Adam.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.839
Porn stars make little boys
ham sammiches too.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.428
I'm gonna find that porno room,

15:29.512 --> 15:31.388
and I'm not going to be the one
cranking down in the corner

15:31.514 --> 15:33.515
and potentially being a stunt cock. No!

15:33.933 --> 15:35.809
I'm gonna shut it down.

15:35.893 --> 15:39.396
'Cause no mommy should go home
and make ham sammiches

15:39.522 --> 15:42.899
for little boys with ejaculate on their fingers.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.484
I'm doing it.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.695
For the mommies!

15:46.946 --> 15:48.822
Look, I just wanted to apologize to you guys.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.450
We got off on the wrong foot.
I'm here to clear the air.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.201
With a Gabriel Iglesias-style joke.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.454
-Better be funny.
-It's funny.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.998
There's an Air Force guy
and a Coast Guard guy

15:58.124 --> 15:59.666
and they're walking down the street, right?

16:00.126 --> 16:03.378
And they see this kid playing
with a pile of poop.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.757
So they go, "Hey, kid, what are you making?"

16:07.216 --> 16:09.301
Kid goes, "I'm making a pilot."

16:09.469 --> 16:11.762
--Nice.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.597
-Get 'em.
-Air Force guy's like,

16:13.765 --> 16:15.932
"What?" And then the kid says, uh,

16:16.142 --> 16:17.893
"Yeah, I would've made a Coast Guard,

16:18.102 --> 16:19.394
"but I didn't have enough shit."

16:19.479 --> 16:20.729
Frickin' see ya!

16:30.615 --> 16:31.823
You guys chasing this guy?

16:32.158 --> 16:33.325
Wanna help me get him off my ladder?

16:33.534 --> 16:34.743
-Yeah.
-Hey, thanks.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.370
Thanks for that, I really...
No, no, guys, come on.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.205
-This is all set up?
-Looks dynamite.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.582
Great. All right, I'm excited.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.044
Whoa. Hey, there he is. Wow.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.713
Hey, do you still want to do
that Australian voice? That could be fun.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.840
I don't care anymore.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.676
Well, let's roll, people.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.135
Time to get that dick out, homey.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.762
- Yeah.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.639
Ah, stop, stop!

16:55.765 --> 16:57.432
Is this the porno? Cover up your bosoms.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.226
You could be my mommy. My mommy doesn't

16:59.310 --> 17:01.436
have her boobies flopped out,
they're flopped in.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.106
-What the hell is this? Who are all these...
-Shh!

17:06.025 --> 17:07.442
The mirror.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.947
I always crank down while
looking into a mirror.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.450
-Really.
-Yeah.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.993
So I could see myself enjoying it.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.246
It's not weird. A lot of dudes do it nowadays.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.622
It's, like, a millennial thing.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.916
That doesn't matter. What matters is...

17:24.085 --> 17:25.961
The image is reversed.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.381
That means the porno's not in room 18.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.759
It's in the reverse version of that.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.721
Room... Uh...

17:36.472 --> 17:38.473
-Eighty-one?
-Yep, that's it, s'go!

17:38.641 --> 17:39.725
Stop it, I'm serious.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.852
Come on, man, you already
made a dog toss my salad.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.854
Stop it! Guys, okay, that's it.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.856
That's it. Coming at ya.

17:48.651 --> 17:49.818
He's hocking bombs.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.243
Oh, bye.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.038
Get that pecker out, buddy.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.707
Working on it.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.834
Time to get it out, though. Seriously.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.210
-Okay, I can't.
-What?

18:07.336 --> 18:09.254
I'm sorry, it's, like... It's very small, all right?

18:09.338 --> 18:12.382
It's like the... You know the
plastic thing at the end of a shoelace.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.217
Just take it out now, man!

18:14.385 --> 18:16.261
- I need it now.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.596
I need that penis, Blake.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.188
We're like
fresh fresh fresh

18:26.522 --> 18:28.440
Quit crying and let me see that donger, bro.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.400
--Just do it, man.

18:30.485 --> 18:31.735
-I am!
-Take your dick out...

18:31.944 --> 18:33.653
Party's over, porno boy!

18:33.863 --> 18:35.530
--Blake...

18:36.199 --> 18:37.699
You're the one who's doing the porno?

18:38.868 --> 18:40.869
New Adam is mad at you for doing this porno,

18:41.078 --> 18:42.788
and old Adam is frickin' pissed
you didn't invite him,

18:42.872 --> 18:46.041
so now you have two mad Adams
to answer to.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.334
-Man, I'm, like...
-Two mad Adams!

18:47.418 --> 18:48.752
-I'm sorry, all right?
-Madams!

18:48.961 --> 18:50.045
- I'm mad at myself too.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.254
- Hey?
- Ders?

18:51.339 --> 18:52.881
Help, somebody please let me in.

18:55.051 --> 18:58.720
Oh, jeez, you are feeling fat
as hell. Oh, my God.

18:58.971 --> 18:59.971
What is going on in here, though?

19:00.223 --> 19:01.431
He gave me a bunch of beer and, like,

19:01.557 --> 19:03.058
she gave me some weed
and then they're, like, telling me

19:03.142 --> 19:04.392
to show my little Henderson, I'm like,

19:04.477 --> 19:06.019
-"Dude, I don't want to."
-That's what they do.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.979
That's what they do. Shh, cover your bosoms,

19:08.147 --> 19:10.273
cover your bosoms.
Because I'm about to save you

19:10.441 --> 19:12.818
and this poor, sweet, innocent girl Crystal

19:13.027 --> 19:15.737
from her evil oppressor Landon,
who I actually

19:15.905 --> 19:18.323
-appreciate his films!
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.200
-Don't do that. Don't.
-Come at me, bro!

19:20.368 --> 19:21.493
You don't even know... You don't even know

19:21.577 --> 19:23.286
what you're doing
because he washed your brain.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.039
Look, I'm... I'm not brainwashed.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.290
You know I'm a producer on this.

19:27.750 --> 19:28.917
I own 40% of the company.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.253
Plus, I love to squirt on film.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.504
It's kind of my thing.

19:32.588 --> 19:36.716
So, you're telling me that
some girls do like doing pornog.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.885
- Oh, yeah.
- That's right, Adam.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.179
No man has a right to tell a woman

19:41.264 --> 19:42.389
what to do with her body.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.891
Even if she's being sexually exploited.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.103
I knew you were an idiot. Hell yeah!

19:48.312 --> 19:50.230
Cool. I'm a big fan.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.399
Give me that paper back
or you're a dead man.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.276
You got me running all over campus.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.611
I should be chasing chicks, not dudes!

19:56.821 --> 19:58.029
Wait, hold up!

19:58.239 --> 20:00.782
You want to be chasing chicks,
what, are you guys trying

20:00.908 --> 20:02.158
to get your bone on or something?

20:02.368 --> 20:03.618
-Oh, yeah.
-Cool.

20:03.744 --> 20:07.914
Well, what if these bros
get in your little movie?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.708
That's a... That's a good idea. Maybe do

20:09.876 --> 20:11.459
kind of a Coast Guard gangbang
kind of thing.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.128
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And if you guys want to, like,

20:13.212 --> 20:14.713
get crazy, get weird, they've got this little

20:14.797 --> 20:16.965
French bulldog that you know
can toss a salad...

20:17.133 --> 20:19.467
-Uh-huh, sure.
-Like, it's crazy good.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.511
How do you know that?

20:22.638 --> 20:24.931
Could. It could toss a salad.
You know, it could.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.308
You know it could.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.227
Guys, this is great, I think
we're going to get, like, all 100 contacts.

20:29.312 --> 20:30.645
-Nice.
-Thanks for the help.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.981
Probably should've just asked
you right from the jump, huh?

20:33.482 --> 20:35.025
-No.
-We would've ditched you.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.568
Immediately. That was our whole game plan.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.695
-Okay, good.
-Totally. But, hey, what do you say

20:38.821 --> 20:40.655
we go back to being best friends, huh?

20:40.740 --> 20:43.909
Let's do it, man. Let's do it, this is awesome.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.828
Go ahead? Also, oh, I was thinking

20:46.913 --> 20:48.663
we should, um...

20:48.998 --> 20:50.248
We should definitely get a dog for the house.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.416
For, like, security and stuff.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.085
-Like, not... To, like, play with.
-Oh.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.796
That dog licked your butthole, didn't it?

21:02.011 --> 21:03.720
Just do it! What is your problem?

21:03.846 --> 21:05.388
Wait.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.515
Oh, Jesus, how hard...

21:12.021 --> 21:14.522
You're not taking a shit,
you're taking off your pants!

21:14.649 --> 21:16.691
- Let's see that dick, man!
