<b>1x05 - Heir Apparent</b>

00:07.145 --> 00:09.146
<i>Previously on "Green Lantern"...</i>

00:09.214 --> 00:12.783
We fight them, we stop
them, whatever it takes.

00:12.851 --> 00:15.486
Just how are we gonna
stop who knows how many

00:15.554 --> 00:18.923
superpowerful Red Lanterns
with just the two of us?

00:19.699 --> 00:22.924
<i>sync, correction by f1nc0
- - Addic7ed.com - -</i>

00:23.395 --> 00:28.165
<i>I'm getting more comfortable
in my human/robotic form every day.</i>

00:28.233 --> 00:31.302
<i>I can now assemble
myself in 2.1 seconds.</i>

00:31.370 --> 00:33.337
And up until two days ago,
you weren't much more than

00:33.405 --> 00:37.441
a real smart disembodied voice.
Jordan, back me up here.

00:37.509 --> 00:42.146
Any girl who can get ready in less 
than 3 seconds has my stamp of approval.

00:42.214 --> 00:44.215
<i>Sensors have located
the energy signature</i>

00:44.283 --> 00:49.420
<i>of a Green Lantern power ring
approximately 18.2 teraquads from us.</i>

00:49.488 --> 00:52.556
Great work, Aya.
Plot a course directly to that signal.

00:52.624 --> 00:53.858
We're doing a little recruiting.

00:53.926 --> 00:58.462
Which if successful will bring the total
of your Green Lantern Force to 3.

00:58.530 --> 01:01.132
Atrocitus will be shaking in his boots.

01:01.199 --> 01:02.533
4 including you.

01:02.601 --> 01:05.303
<i>And there would be 5 of
us if you included me.</i>

01:05.370 --> 01:09.106
Right, and how I could
forget with you constantly bringing it up?

01:09.174 --> 01:11.709
Jordan, you got stuff the
genie back in her box.

01:11.777 --> 01:14.111
You can't let our nav
computer get used to walking

01:14.179 --> 01:15.680
around like a real person.

01:15.747 --> 01:19.750
<i>You may be unaware that
I can hear every sound on this vessel.</i>

01:19.818 --> 01:22.153
Aya, I appreciate
the enthusiasm, but I think

01:22.220 --> 01:23.921
It's best if you stay with the ship.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.702
<i>Our queen and sovereign.</i>

01:42.207 --> 01:45.643
- Great timing as usual, Hal.
- It's a gift.

01:45.711 --> 01:48.512
Hold. Observe their
garb and manner.

01:48.580 --> 01:52.249
They are Green Lanterns
and friends.

01:52.317 --> 01:56.721
I am Queen Iolande.
I welcome you to Betrassus.

01:56.788 --> 01:58.289
Dulac used to tell
me stories of other

01:58.357 --> 01:59.790
Green Lanterns,
but I thought they

01:59.858 --> 02:01.692
were nothing but tall tales.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.261
This is my brother Prince Ragnar.

02:04.329 --> 02:07.631
Iolande, your name
sounds like a waterfall.

02:10.702 --> 02:13.771
Worst line ever.

02:13.839 --> 02:16.774
We're looking for the
Green Lantern that serves your planet.

02:16.842 --> 02:18.209
Green Lantern Dulac.

02:18.276 --> 02:21.212
He has protected
Betrassus for many years.

02:21.279 --> 02:24.281
We need his help to fight a
deadly threat on the frontier.

02:24.349 --> 02:26.250
You speak of the Red Lanterns.

02:26.318 --> 02:28.552
Several of our off-planet
outposts have been attacked

02:28.620 --> 02:30.187
by these vicious marauders.

02:30.255 --> 02:32.256
You're probably the only
ones strong enough to fight

02:32.324 --> 02:33.858
off the Red Lanterns.

02:33.925 --> 02:35.226
Enough!

02:35.293 --> 02:37.428
Betrassus doesn't
need Green Lanterns.

02:37.496 --> 02:41.198
We need a king to command its
army, and that will be me!

02:41.266 --> 02:44.702
Kothak, once again you
overstep your bounds.

02:44.770 --> 02:46.370
It is our custom.

02:46.438 --> 02:49.407
If the queen is coroneted
without a husband, then the

02:49.474 --> 02:52.510
greatest warrior may claim
her hand and share the throne.

02:52.577 --> 02:54.211
Face it, princess.

02:54.279 --> 02:57.515
You don't have what it takes
to rule this kingdom alone.

02:57.582 --> 03:01.619
Will no one challenge
Kothak for my sister's hand?

03:01.686 --> 03:06.424
<i>I will challenge Kothak
for the hand of Iolande.</i>

03:06.491 --> 03:08.626
I think we found our man.

03:13.598 --> 03:17.701
I've seen the destruction caused
by the Red Lanterns with my own eyes.

03:17.769 --> 03:20.805
I would be proud to join
your fight against them.

03:20.872 --> 03:22.840
It will mean leaving the queen.

03:22.908 --> 03:26.911
Iolande has no love for
a tired old warhorse like me.

03:26.978 --> 03:30.347
I'll marry her to keep her
throne save from Kothak.

03:30.415 --> 03:33.217
He is not to be trusted,
but once I win her hand,

03:33.285 --> 03:37.621
I can best protect her and our
world by joining your crusade.

03:37.689 --> 03:40.925
It's pretty easy to see why
you were chosen by your ring.

03:40.992 --> 03:42.793
Happy to have you aboard.

03:45.730 --> 03:50.434
I still can't believe you're here,
another actual Green Lantern.

03:50.502 --> 03:52.336
I am sir Dulac's greatest
supporter, and now I'm

03:52.404 --> 03:54.939
here to offer you equal devotion.

03:55.006 --> 03:58.275
Excuse me for overhearing, but
you said the ring chose you to

03:58.343 --> 03:59.877
be a Green Lantern.

03:59.945 --> 04:02.446
Were there many tests of
your strength and bravery?

04:02.514 --> 04:04.982
No. I was nearby when the
Green Lantern in my sector

04:05.050 --> 04:07.418
died, and his ring came to me.

04:07.486 --> 04:10.254
Anyone can seem like
a warrior when wearing the most

04:10.322 --> 04:11.989
powerful weapon on the planet.

04:12.057 --> 04:13.858
The terms of the challenge
state that we face

04:13.925 --> 04:15.526
each other equally armed.

04:15.594 --> 04:18.995
Then you'll see I'm more
a hero than Dulac will ever be.

04:19.064 --> 04:20.964
We shall see.

04:24.336 --> 04:25.703
He ought to be on a leash.

04:25.770 --> 04:29.273
I will put a stop to
Kothak's scheming tomorrow.

04:29.341 --> 04:32.009
Then you shall have my aid.

04:32.077 --> 04:34.245
[cheering]

04:48.093 --> 04:49.960
<i>Boo!</i>

04:53.532 --> 04:55.299
[indistinct chatter]

04:55.367 --> 04:58.302
Hmm.

04:58.370 --> 05:01.572
Milady, sir Dulac cannot be found.

05:01.640 --> 05:05.309
[crowd gasping and murmuring]

05:05.377 --> 05:08.479
Clearly your precious
green knight has fled.

05:08.547 --> 05:10.014
That doesn't make any sense.

05:10.081 --> 05:13.684
Name one Green Lantern you've ever
known to run away from a fight.

05:13.752 --> 05:20.057
So Dulac forfeits the challenge.
Iolande is mine.

05:20.125 --> 05:23.694
We saw yesterday that there
is no one else on Betrassus brave

05:23.762 --> 05:25.829
enough to face me.

05:25.897 --> 05:28.732
No, but the is
one brave enough now.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.601
Here we go.

05:30.669 --> 05:33.537
I will fight for
the hand of Iolande.

05:33.605 --> 05:35.072
[cheering]

05:38.852 --> 05:41.119
<i>I will not allow it?</i>

05:41.187 --> 05:44.923
This Green Lantern is an outsider
with no royal blood whatsoever.

05:44.990 --> 05:47.659
If you win, you're gonna
have to stay here and rule.

05:47.726 --> 05:51.362
We've got an agenda,
an intergalactic menace to destroy.

05:51.430 --> 05:52.997
Don't get your
regulation undies in a bunch.

05:53.065 --> 05:56.768
I'll defeat Kothak, then release
Iolande to rule in her own right.

05:56.836 --> 05:59.737
Everybody wins, happily
ever after, boo-yah.

05:59.805 --> 06:01.739
Does he understand the
challenge must be fought

06:01.807 --> 06:03.875
without his precious power ring?

06:03.943 --> 06:06.878
He does.
He's also right here in the room,

06:06.946 --> 06:09.047
so you don't have to talk
about him in the third person,

06:09.114 --> 06:12.016
and he looks forward
to kicking your butt tomorrow.

06:12.084 --> 06:14.085
Err.

06:14.153 --> 06:15.920
<i>The ship is primed
and ready to leave.</i>

06:15.988 --> 06:18.289
<i>Why aren't you back here
with the Lantern we tracked?</i>

06:18.357 --> 06:19.858
He's gone missing.

06:19.925 --> 06:21.392
<i>I can easily find him.</i>

06:21.460 --> 06:24.863
No. You can't just go running
around in that Red Lantern getup.

06:24.930 --> 06:27.165
We've got enough on our hands
without you starting a panic.

06:27.233 --> 06:29.300
<i>My talents are
wasted waiting here.</i>

06:29.368 --> 06:30.869
Stay with Aya.

06:30.936 --> 06:34.272
Have her run a scan
for Dulac's power ring.

06:34.340 --> 06:36.774
<i>Sensors have located
a weak energy trail.</i>

06:36.842 --> 06:40.044
<i>It is possible that it is
Green Lantern Dulac's ring.</i>

06:40.112 --> 06:41.980
<i>The energy trail is too
distant to make that</i>

06:42.047 --> 06:43.982
<i>determination with
total confidence.</i>

06:44.049 --> 06:46.150
So you're saying we
need to be closer.

06:46.218 --> 06:49.954
<i>It would aid me, but
our orders are to remain on the ship.</i>

06:50.022 --> 06:51.723
I was ordered to help you
trace the power ring, which is

06:51.790 --> 06:56.895
exactly what we'll be doing if you
put yourself together and go with me.

06:56.962 --> 07:00.832
<i>Only 2.1 seconds to assemble.</i>

07:00.900 --> 07:03.201
<i>Are my components
properly aligned?</i>

07:03.269 --> 07:05.770
You look fine.

07:05.838 --> 07:08.139
<i>You also look fine.</i>

07:19.852 --> 07:24.289
You'll need practice.
Kothak is very skilled on his machine.

07:24.356 --> 07:25.757
I could help you.

07:25.824 --> 07:29.193
Back on my home planet,
I'm a test pilot for supersonic aircraft.

07:29.261 --> 07:32.764
I don't think this little sidewalk skimmer
will give me any problems.

07:32.831 --> 07:36.100
In fact, I'll probably invent a few
new moves while I'm feeling it out.

07:36.168 --> 07:40.438
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, ohh!

07:40.506 --> 07:42.740
Unh!

07:42.808 --> 07:45.243
You're right.
That was new.

08:06.632 --> 08:09.601
For future reference, when
in my physical form, I prefer

08:09.668 --> 08:12.036
not to be pushed into the dirt.

08:20.980 --> 08:26.250
Whoa!
Nnunh!

08:26.318 --> 08:29.187
Some hero.

08:29.254 --> 08:34.958
I look forward to destroying you
in the tournament tomorrow.

08:35.027 --> 08:39.831
You know, I think I'll
gratefully accept a couple of pointers.

08:39.898 --> 08:42.299
Well, come along then.

08:42.368 --> 08:46.904
If you can keep up, that is.

08:46.972 --> 08:50.842
She fell for the waterfall line.
Unbelievable.

08:50.909 --> 08:53.311
I thought you might be thirsty.

08:53.379 --> 08:58.082
I like a little more slime
floating on top, but thanks, kid.

08:58.150 --> 09:00.918
Have I told you what an
honor it is to have you here?

09:00.986 --> 09:03.221
Over and over.

09:03.288 --> 09:07.458
My beloved kingdom is under
threat and not just by the Red Lanterns.

09:07.526 --> 09:09.961
There's an internal threat,
as well, so having two

09:10.029 --> 09:12.363
Green Lanterns here
is a great comfort.

09:12.431 --> 09:15.566
3 lanterns counting Dulac,
soon as we track him down.

09:15.634 --> 09:19.070
Heck, 4 if you count Aya.
Heh. She'd love that.

09:28.714 --> 09:30.048
Ha ha ha!

09:30.115 --> 09:31.783
[motor sputters]

09:46.231 --> 09:48.466
I had no idea these
machines were so unstable.

09:48.534 --> 09:50.301
They aren't.

09:50.369 --> 09:52.236
You think someone
did this deliberately?

09:52.304 --> 09:54.238
Kothak is capable of anything.

09:54.306 --> 09:56.641
This situation is
getting far too dangerous.

09:56.709 --> 10:00.178
I want you to back out of
the challenge, for your own protection.

10:00.245 --> 10:01.879
Back out? Not on your life.

10:01.947 --> 10:04.382
This just got interesting for me.

10:04.450 --> 10:06.050
You are brave.

10:06.118 --> 10:09.120
I don't know if fighting for
my throne is even worth it.

10:09.188 --> 10:13.124
A queen must be wise, strong,
clever, and a million other

10:13.192 --> 10:16.527
things that I don't know if
I am or will ever be.

10:16.595 --> 10:20.665
You're all of those
things and so much more.

10:20.733 --> 10:22.834
How can you be so sure?

10:22.901 --> 10:26.138
I'm a pretty good judge of character.

10:27.206 --> 10:29.440
My sensors indicate the
energy signal is getting

10:29.508 --> 10:33.678
stronger, but it seems
our search is over.

10:33.746 --> 10:35.646
Not quite.

10:47.426 --> 10:49.261
Dulac.

10:50.329 --> 10:53.531
There doesn't seem to be any
signs indicating a struggle.

10:53.599 --> 10:57.635
So he didn't go down fighting.
Odd.

10:57.703 --> 11:00.905
His ring is gone.
Has it gone back to Oa?

11:00.973 --> 11:03.074
The interceptor's sensors
would have noted that.

11:03.142 --> 11:06.077
The signal is still near here.

11:06.145 --> 11:08.546
It's time we notify the others.

11:13.051 --> 11:14.519
Great job obeying orders.

11:14.586 --> 11:16.220
Do I need to write
them down from now on?

11:16.288 --> 11:17.655
A warrior acts.

11:17.723 --> 11:20.091
A warrior listens to his superiors.

11:20.159 --> 11:23.194
Enough. I'll give them the
insubordination lecture later.

11:23.262 --> 11:24.462
What have you found?

11:24.530 --> 11:26.197
We found his body in the catacombs.

11:26.265 --> 11:28.900
We're still trying to
locate his power ring.

11:28.967 --> 11:31.435
If it hasn't chosen
a new bearer already.

11:31.503 --> 11:35.239
My sensors indicate that the ring
is somewhere within the castle walls.

11:35.307 --> 11:37.441
My gut instinct tells me
so is the killer.

11:37.509 --> 11:40.978
Then we must find this
murderer and bring him to justice.

11:41.046 --> 11:42.513
It is what Green Lanterns do.

11:42.581 --> 11:46.484
We will, but we have to do it carefully.
We'll need proof.

11:46.552 --> 11:47.552
You go back to the ship.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.153
We'll call if we need backup,

11:49.221 --> 11:50.988
but we might have to make
a quick exit.

11:51.056 --> 11:54.259
Kilowog and I have a trap to set.

11:55.327 --> 11:57.495
[crowd cheering]

12:16.315 --> 12:20.384
And here, another flagon of that ale
you so enjoyed before.

12:20.452 --> 12:23.354
Hey!
You remembered the slime!

12:23.622 --> 12:28.659
Iolande, prepare to wed
as soon as I defeat this peasant.

12:28.727 --> 12:32.096
Know your place, Kothak.

12:32.164 --> 12:35.233
Queen Iolande, I fight so
that your people might have

12:35.300 --> 12:38.236
the capable, honest ruler they deserve.

13:10.235 --> 13:13.004
Keep your chin up, Jordan!
Focus!

13:20.579 --> 13:22.580
[cheering]

13:54.313 --> 13:57.615
Come on, Jordan!

13:57.683 --> 13:59.984
[coughing]

14:03.155 --> 14:05.790
[choking]

14:05.857 --> 14:07.425
Aah!

14:14.199 --> 14:18.035
Ohh! Poison!
He's been murdered!

14:25.699 --> 14:27.466
Kilowog! Come on, buddy.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.269
Speak to me! Please.

14:30.337 --> 14:35.074
Hal, he's gone.

14:35.142 --> 14:38.444
No!
Whoever did this will pay.

14:38.512 --> 14:42.114
The death of the outsider
is inconsequential.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.985
I demand my challenger return
to the field so I may defeat

14:46.053 --> 14:50.356
him and become the
rightful king of Betrassus.

14:50.424 --> 14:52.959
Look! The ring!

14:53.026 --> 14:54.894
[gasping]

15:06.540 --> 15:10.676
Finally. It's mine!
The power I've dreamed of!

15:10.744 --> 15:13.145
Again, I protest this delay.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.948
Your silly contest no
longer matters, Kothak.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.584
What matters is that I'm
a Green Lantern, the most

15:18.652 --> 15:22.922
powerful citizen of Betrassus.
I shall be your ruler.

15:22.990 --> 15:26.259
Bow down and grovel to me,
your new king!

15:26.326 --> 15:29.395
You did this!
You murdered my friend!

15:29.463 --> 15:32.932
I had to. You told me that
when a Lantern dies

15:33.000 --> 15:35.268
his ring searches for the next
worthy person.

15:35.335 --> 15:38.537
Knowing myself to be most
worthy, I killed Dulac so

15:38.605 --> 15:40.072
that his ring might come to me.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.174
[booing]

15:42.242 --> 15:43.943
Do not judge me!

15:44.011 --> 15:45.945
I loved Dulac more than any of you.

15:46.013 --> 15:49.715
That's why I killed him,
to honor him by being his successor.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.817
And Kilowog?
Why him?

15:51.885 --> 15:55.121
Dulac's ring didn't come
to me, so I had to try again.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.522
I had to!

15:56.590 --> 15:59.458
Sorry, but I can't let
you get away with this.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.862
You don't have a choice,
none of you!

16:07.668 --> 16:10.202
Unh!

16:10.270 --> 16:11.537
What happened to my ring?

16:11.605 --> 16:14.240
Where is it?
I want my ring!

16:14.308 --> 16:16.676
I still have it.

16:16.743 --> 16:21.614
The ring you thought chose you was
a construct I made while playing dead.

16:21.682 --> 16:25.017
Bravo, Kilowog.
Excellent performance.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.019
Heh.
Aw, gee. Thanks.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.188
I thought maybe slobbering
the grog all over a was a bit

16:29.256 --> 16:32.491
much, but I sure has heck
wasn't gonna drink any.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.695
Oh, Ragnar, I am heartbroken.

16:35.762 --> 16:40.232
This is my planet.
I was born to lead!

16:40.300 --> 16:42.468
I'll show you all!

16:42.536 --> 16:43.736
My queen!

16:43.804 --> 16:45.338
Your reign is over, sister.

16:45.405 --> 16:49.543
Look at how easily I paid
off your guards.

16:50.610 --> 16:55.181
If I cannot rule Betrassus,
then neither will you.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.319
Attack now!

17:00.387 --> 17:02.221
Kilowog, my ring.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.327
Aah!

17:24.778 --> 17:26.311
Aah!

17:31.351 --> 17:33.018
[groaning]

17:49.870 --> 17:52.004
[groaning]

18:10.424 --> 18:13.092
Give it up, Ragnar!
Don't be a fool!

18:27.874 --> 18:29.809
Close the gates!

18:35.382 --> 18:39.318
- Unh!
- Unh!

18:39.386 --> 18:40.853
[moans]

18:42.389 --> 18:43.622
Stay back!

18:43.690 --> 18:45.991
Let me go, or I'll kill her.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.964
Iolande, put the ring on now!

19:06.213 --> 19:07.980
Aaaaugh!

19:12.619 --> 19:15.087
Please!
I beg for quarter.

19:23.964 --> 19:25.764
The true enemy is defeated.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.934
We thank our lantern friends
for bringing him to justice.

19:29.002 --> 19:35.107
Guards, round up the traitors
and take my brother to the tower.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.375
You'll all be sorry.

19:36.443 --> 19:42.248
I will be a Lantern, and then you'll pay!
You'll all pay!

19:42.315 --> 19:48.254
You will be... nay.
You are a great leader.

19:48.321 --> 19:54.460
You are my queen and sovereign,
and to you I offer all my loyalty.

19:54.528 --> 19:57.963
Better late than never.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.699
<i>Our queen and sovereign!</i>

20:03.370 --> 20:06.372
<i>Did you know all along
Ragnar had killed Dulac?</i>

20:06.439 --> 20:10.242
No, but he was a little too curious
about how you become a Green Lantern.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.645
Then Kilowog remembered that
Ragnar was happy to have

20:12.712 --> 20:14.580
two Green Lanterns on Betrassus.

20:14.648 --> 20:18.651
Only someone who knew Dulac was dead
wouldn't include him in the count.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.786
But how did you know
I had the ring?

20:20.854 --> 20:24.123
Once I found out Dulac was dead,
I knew his ring would go

20:24.190 --> 20:29.862
to the most worthy person, and like I said,
I'm a pretty good judge of character.

20:29.930 --> 20:31.830
Thank you for everything.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.433
Now that you're a Green
Lantern, will you join us in our

20:34.501 --> 20:36.335
fight against the Red Lanterns?

20:36.403 --> 20:39.371
I would love nothing more
than to go with you, but I'm

20:39.439 --> 20:42.174
more than
a Green Lantern to my people.

20:42.242 --> 20:47.346
- You're their queen.
- Yes, and duty to them comes first.

20:47.414 --> 20:50.249
Unfortunately my
birthright is not a choice.

20:50.317 --> 20:53.586
In fact, there are very few
things I can choose,

20:53.653 --> 20:55.220
but this is one of them.

20:59.059 --> 21:00.926
Good-bye, Hal Jordan.

21:08.915 --> 21:10.944
