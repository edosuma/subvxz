26:11.945 --> 26:14.447
Sorry.Have you been waiting long?

26:14.447 --> 26:16.783
No.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.870
We're a little understaffed,as you can imagine.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.706
It's a family business.

26:22.747 --> 26:25.834
My parents are nowplanning a funeral.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.627
Someone needsto hold the course.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.796
I don't want to take uptoo much of your time.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.924
Is this the, uh, the lotbehind the firehouse?

26:32.966 --> 26:33.925
It is,

26:33.967 --> 26:35.594
but soon it will beaffordable housing.

26:35.635 --> 26:38.638
That's what we do here--real estate development.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.682
We've built half this town.

26:42.767 --> 26:46.438
I'm not sure I have muchto add to my original statement.

26:46.479 --> 26:47.439
That's okay.

26:47.480 --> 26:48.898
I was just hopingto get some insight

26:48.940 --> 26:51.651
into Kevin's moodin his final days.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.321
Did you notice anything oddabout his behavior?

26:54.321 --> 26:55.864
Odd how?

26:55.905 --> 26:58.992
Did he seemnervous, agitated?

26:58.992 --> 27:02.829
No. He was getting married.He was over the moon.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.998
That is,until the rehearsal dinner.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.166
When Jenna's ex showed up.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.667
Can you imagine?

27:07.709 --> 27:08.710
You know...

27:08.752 --> 27:11.338
I always hadmy suspicions about her.

27:11.338 --> 27:12.547
Really?

27:12.589 --> 27:13.923
So you question her motivesfor marrying your brother?

27:13.965 --> 27:15.800
Kevin was very successful.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.636
He was recently promotedto number two at our company.

27:18.678 --> 27:22.015
She stood to gain a lotas his wife.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.684
Maybe even more as his widow.

27:24.684 --> 27:27.645
You suspect she had somethingto do with the murder?

27:27.687 --> 27:29.856
I just wonderif Greg's infatuation with her

27:29.856 --> 27:31.232
was only one-sided.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.735
Are you saying that Jennastill had feelings for him?

27:33.777 --> 27:36.071
Well, why would Gregtry to break up a wedding

27:36.112 --> 27:38.740
unless he thoughthe had a good chance to succeed?

27:39.741 --> 27:42.661
[♪♪]

27:49.501 --> 27:53.254
[Peter Davis] I want to knowwhy Greg Adams isn't in custody.

27:53.296 --> 27:56.091
Peter, please.They're trying to help us.

27:56.132 --> 27:57.926
I'm sorry, Claire,but this is absurd!

27:57.967 --> 28:00.553
The boy created a sceneat the rehearsal dinner.

28:00.595 --> 28:02.263
He's as guiltyas the day is long!

28:02.305 --> 28:03.515
Believe me, Mr. Davis,

28:03.556 --> 28:07.227
we're looking very closelyat that situation.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.895
My son was murdered.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.064
Someone's gonnapay for that.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.774
Dearly!

28:14.442 --> 28:15.693
I'm sorry.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.788
What have you goton Greg Adams?

28:26.830 --> 28:28.373
Not enough to hold him.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.417
Keep looking.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.922
The Davis family'svery well connected.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.090
Deep pockets.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.259
The Kennedys of Willow Haven,if you will.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.845
There's gonna be a lot ofpressure to solve this quickly.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.638
Yeah, but we don't evenhave a murder weapon yet.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.181
I know that.I'm just sayin'.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.641
Hey there, Nick.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.184
Always nice to see you.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.269
You too, Sue.

28:49.310 --> 28:50.562
How's Billy's T-ball team?

28:50.603 --> 28:51.938
Undefeated,thank you very much!

28:51.938 --> 28:53.022
All right.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.607
That's my grandson.

28:54.649 --> 28:57.110
You must be Detective Acosta.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.111
I am.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.280
Heard you boughtthe old Watterson house,

29:00.280 --> 29:01.281
off of Grove?

29:01.281 --> 29:03.741
Uh... yes.

29:03.783 --> 29:04.576
I did.

29:04.617 --> 29:05.827
[Sue whistles and chuckles]

29:05.869 --> 29:07.996
You've got your workcut out for you with that one.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.040
I'll give you boysa minute to look over the menu.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.292
Sounds good.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.710
Thanks, Sue.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.296
How did she know that?

29:16.337 --> 29:17.505
Life in a small town.

29:18.339 --> 29:20.383
Must be a bit ofa culture shock, huh?

29:20.425 --> 29:22.635
Coming all the way herefrom New York.

29:22.635 --> 29:24.137
Yeah, well, to put it mildly.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.013
Well, you'll get used to it.

29:25.054 --> 29:26.014
Before you know it,

29:26.055 --> 29:28.808
you'll be a full-fledgedWillow Havenite.

29:28.808 --> 29:30.977
Great. Any tipsfor speeding up the process?

29:30.977 --> 29:33.313
Well, to be honestwith you, Sam...

29:33.313 --> 29:35.607
I'd recommend the tuna melt.

29:35.648 --> 29:37.192
I don't like tuna.

29:37.233 --> 29:40.570
Corned-beef hash it is.Sue? A couple hash, please.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.946
[Sue] Sure thing, Nick.

29:41.988 --> 29:43.114
You'll love it.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.157
Yeah.

29:47.076 --> 29:48.286
Did Kevin tell you about

29:48.328 --> 29:51.456
an argument he had with his dadbefore the ceremony?

29:51.498 --> 29:53.625
No, but Kevin wouldtry to shield me

29:53.666 --> 29:56.586
from all that tension.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.338
So this wasn'ttheir first fight?

29:58.379 --> 29:59.506
Hardly.

29:59.547 --> 30:01.799
The son of Willow Haven'smost prominent family

30:01.841 --> 30:03.468
is marrying a waitress

30:03.510 --> 30:05.220
that worksat the diner downtown?

30:05.261 --> 30:07.055
It was a sore spot.

30:07.096 --> 30:10.517
Wait. Mr. Davis wasreally that upset about it?

30:11.518 --> 30:14.437
Things have been strainedbetween Kevin and his father

30:14.479 --> 30:15.647
for a while,

30:15.688 --> 30:17.607
especiallyafter Kevin's promotion.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.317
Do you know why?

30:19.359 --> 30:20.485
Not exactly.

30:20.527 --> 30:23.029
Kevin was takinghis new position very seriously,

30:23.029 --> 30:24.364
you know?

30:24.405 --> 30:25.907
I think it startedto create enemies

30:25.949 --> 30:27.450
within the company.

30:27.492 --> 30:30.537
Mr. Davis turned it aroundand blamed me.

30:30.537 --> 30:31.579
You? For what?

30:31.621 --> 30:34.040
He said that I wastrying to drive a wedge

30:34.082 --> 30:36.501
between his sonand his family,

30:36.543 --> 30:39.546
but I had nothing to dowith it, you know?

30:40.797 --> 30:41.881
Hey, girls...

30:41.881 --> 30:45.051
Can I get you anything at all?

30:45.093 --> 30:46.094
Maybe something to eat?

30:46.135 --> 30:47.387
No, I'm okay.

30:47.387 --> 30:48.513
Thank you, though.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.098
We're okay, Mom.

30:50.139 --> 30:50.974
Thank you.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.559
All right.Well...

30:52.600 --> 30:56.020
I'll just leave you to it then.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.898
Thanks.

30:58.898 --> 31:00.400
-She's so sweet.-Yeah.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.694
She's really worried about me.

31:02.735 --> 31:06.072
I haven't had a moment alonesince the reception.

31:07.448 --> 31:08.408
I'm sorry.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.660
I know it's a lot.

31:13.413 --> 31:16.291
These enemies Kevin was makingat the company...

31:16.332 --> 31:18.626
Were any of themat the wedding?

31:21.921 --> 31:23.715
I've had a breakthrough.

31:23.756 --> 31:25.758
Hello, Miss Adams.

31:25.758 --> 31:27.969
Okay.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.470
What am I looking at?

31:29.512 --> 31:33.474
Kevin and his dad got intoan argument before the ceremony.

31:33.516 --> 31:34.559
He was strongly opposed

31:34.601 --> 31:37.562
to Kevin going throughwith this wedding.

31:37.604 --> 31:38.438
And?

31:38.479 --> 31:39.897
And that's a motive!

31:41.065 --> 31:41.983
Okay...

31:42.025 --> 31:43.401
Bill Cross.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.903
Bill and Kevin werealways butting heads

31:45.945 --> 31:47.238
at Davis Development,

31:47.280 --> 31:49.073
which is also a motive.

31:51.492 --> 31:52.577
Wait, wait. What?

31:52.619 --> 31:53.912
I appreciate whatyou're trying to do,

31:53.953 --> 31:56.247
but you should leavethe police work to us, okay?

31:56.289 --> 31:58.249
We have a witness.

31:59.459 --> 32:00.752
One of the catering staff

32:00.793 --> 32:02.420
saw a man race outinto the parking lot

32:02.462 --> 32:03.963
after Kevin was killed.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.214
She described him

32:05.256 --> 32:07.967
as being tall, broad shoulders,and sandy-brown hair.

32:07.967 --> 32:09.218
Sound familiar?

32:10.053 --> 32:12.805
Sounds like Greg Adams.

Yeah, in the kitchen,through there.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.347
Thank you.

35:00.515 --> 35:03.101
You know, that wasa great idea, honey--

35:03.142 --> 35:04.435
hiringa professional photographer.

35:04.477 --> 35:06.395
I didn't hirea photographer.

Hi, Beth.

It's Allie. Uh...

35:16.864 --> 35:19.826
I met you at the Davis wedding.I was the photographer.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.702
Right. What are you doing here?

35:21.744 --> 35:23.996
Oh, I'm just taking pictures

35:24.038 --> 35:26.415
and capturingall of life's perfect moments,

35:26.457 --> 35:28.876
one photo at a time.

35:28.918 --> 35:32.171
Um, I wanted to ask youa few questions

35:32.213 --> 35:33.381
about the wedding.

35:33.422 --> 35:35.508
Honestly, I'm gettinga little tired

35:35.550 --> 35:37.051
of talking about that.

35:37.093 --> 35:38.761
I already told the policeeverything I know.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.012
I know, I know,

35:40.012 --> 35:42.431
and I'm sorry, but if you couldjust tell me, though?

35:42.473 --> 35:46.102
I'm doingmy own... investigation.

35:46.143 --> 35:48.354
Like a private detective?

35:48.354 --> 35:50.898
Yeah, you could say that.

35:52.483 --> 35:53.484
Please?

35:53.526 --> 35:55.653
I need to know.

35:57.488 --> 36:00.032
Okay, but I didn't see much.

36:00.074 --> 36:02.201
I had spilled some wineon my shirt,

36:02.243 --> 36:04.871
and I was getting a sparefrom my car

36:04.912 --> 36:06.706
when I heardthis really loud crack.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.666
It startled me.

36:08.708 --> 36:09.834
The gunshot?

36:10.751 --> 36:11.794
A few seconds later,

36:11.836 --> 36:13.546
I saw somebody runout of the banquet hall

36:13.546 --> 36:14.672
and down the street.

36:15.631 --> 36:16.507
Um...

36:17.425 --> 36:19.093
That look like him?

36:20.636 --> 36:22.054
Could be.

36:22.096 --> 36:24.724
It was dark,and he was running pretty fast.

36:24.765 --> 36:27.018
So it could've been anybody.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.061
Excuse me,

36:29.103 --> 36:30.188
but neither my husband nor I

36:30.229 --> 36:32.356
remember arrangingfor a photographer.

36:32.398 --> 36:33.774
You didn't?

36:33.816 --> 36:34.734
No, we didn't.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.736
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

36:36.777 --> 36:39.322
I just assumed the officewould have called you.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.240
It's actuallyfree birthday pictures

36:41.282 --> 36:44.452
with every cake order,right?

36:45.411 --> 36:47.914
Uh, I... guess so.

36:49.415 --> 36:51.959
Well... fine, then.

36:52.001 --> 36:54.003
Anyway, we're readyfor the cake.

36:56.672 --> 36:57.965
Thank you.

36:58.007 --> 37:01.427
Please, just get out of herebefore you get me into trouble.

37:03.721 --> 37:07.391
Oh... the man you sawrunning out of the hall.

37:07.433 --> 37:09.101

37:36.379 --> 37:38.255
The question is,what are you doing here?

37:38.297 --> 37:40.633
Although I havea sneaking suspicion

37:40.633 --> 37:41.968
I know the answer.

37:42.009 --> 37:43.219
Maybe I'm herefor flowers.

37:43.260 --> 37:44.720
Are you here for flowers?

37:44.762 --> 37:46.055
No.

Hmm.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.182
Well, since you made the trip,

37:48.224 --> 37:49.642
might as wellbrowse the orchids.

37:49.684 --> 37:50.768
The owner didn'tsee a thing.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.186
Here we are...

37:52.228 --> 37:53.938
a housewarming giftfrom me to you.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.649
No, no, no, I don't havemuch of a green thumb.

37:56.649 --> 37:59.151
Oh, they're succulents,very low maintenance,

37:59.151 --> 38:01.570
but guaranteed to brighten upany space you put it.

38:01.612 --> 38:05.950
Okay. Thank you.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.785
Allie!What a pleasant surprise.

38:07.827 --> 38:08.828
Hello, May.How are you?

38:08.869 --> 38:09.745
Good.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.080
I heard you werein the parking lot

38:11.122 --> 38:12.623
the nightKevin was murdered.

38:12.665 --> 38:16.669
I was, but as I just toldDetective Acosta,

38:16.711 --> 38:17.962
I didn't see a thing,

38:18.004 --> 38:21.048
but I know for a factthat your brother is innocent.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.258
[overlapping] You do?

38:22.300 --> 38:24.010
Well, people are saying

38:24.051 --> 38:26.679
that Greg murdered Kevinout of jealousy.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.055
I don't believe itfor a second.

38:28.097 --> 38:29.223
And why's that?

38:29.265 --> 38:30.850
Well, because he wasin the shop a few weeks ago

38:30.850 --> 38:32.601
buying flowers,red roses.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.937
He looked very happy...

38:34.979 --> 38:36.105
[phone rings]

38:36.147 --> 38:37.231
...too happy to dowhat they're accusing him of.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.482
[phone ringing]I've got to get that.

38:45.072 --> 38:46.824
Miss Adams?

38:46.866 --> 38:49.535
Hey! You okay?

38:49.535 --> 38:50.536
Yeah.

38:50.536 --> 38:53.039
Greg never told mehe was seeing anybody.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.458
Well, did he alwaystell you everything?

38:55.499 --> 38:56.876
He used to.

38:56.917 --> 38:58.044
After our parents died,

38:58.044 --> 38:59.962
he practically raised me,but...

39:00.004 --> 39:01.005
But?

39:01.047 --> 39:02.381
[sighs] I don't know.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.717
I guess we sort ofdrifted apart a little

39:04.759 --> 39:07.720
over the last few years.

39:07.762 --> 39:08.929
Here's a thought.

39:08.971 --> 39:11.015
What if itwasn't a new love?

39:11.057 --> 39:11.891
What?

39:11.932 --> 39:13.642
What if it was an old one?

39:13.684 --> 39:16.062
You think he sentflowers to Jenna?

39:16.103 --> 39:17.438
Maybe the rehearsal dinner

39:17.480 --> 39:19.565
wasn't the first timehe tried to win her back.

39:21.108 --> 39:21.901
Oh. Here.

39:21.942 --> 39:23.444
Oh, I'm not taking your plant.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.905
Oh, no, if it stays with me,it'll be dead in a week, so...

39:25.905 --> 39:27.448
It was a gift.

39:27.490 --> 39:28.908
It still is a gift.

39:28.949 --> 39:30.076
It's just now from me to you.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.619
Put it in the sun,

39:31.660 --> 39:33.996
rotate it frequently,and you will be fine.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.540
[♪♪]

39:41.212 --> 39:43.255
Okay, let's reviewour suspects.

39:43.297 --> 39:46.133
We'll start...with Kevin's dad.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.677
Oh, they had a huge fightbefore the ceremony.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.596
He demandedthat Kevin cancel the wedding,

39:50.596 --> 39:52.139
but he refused.

39:52.181 --> 39:53.432
So you disinvite him

39:53.432 --> 39:55.351
to Thanksgiving,you don't kill him.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.602
Jenna mentioned

39:56.602 --> 39:58.104
there was some tensioninvolving the family business,

39:58.104 --> 39:59.772
so there could bemore to the story.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.649
Okay.

40:01.690 --> 40:03.275
Bill Cross.

40:03.317 --> 40:05.611
He's been workingat Davis Development

40:05.611 --> 40:06.654
for a long time.

40:06.695 --> 40:07.780
Now, all of a sudden,

40:07.780 --> 40:09.865
the owner's songets a promotion before him.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.992
There's got to besome tension there.

40:12.034 --> 40:13.577
See, I agree.My money's on this guy.

40:13.619 --> 40:14.537
As an actress,

40:14.578 --> 40:15.788
I'm a studentof the human condition,

40:15.788 --> 40:18.666
and jealousyis a powerful motivator.

40:18.707 --> 40:20.000
And then...

40:20.042 --> 40:21.127
there's this guy,

40:21.168 --> 40:23.712
seen leaving the buildingafter the murder.

40:23.754 --> 40:24.964
He has opportunity,

40:25.005 --> 40:27.299
but the motive is unknown.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.136
That looks like Cary Grant.

40:30.136 --> 40:30.970
It is.

40:30.970 --> 40:34.473
He sort of fit the description.

40:34.473 --> 40:36.684
[cell ringing]

40:38.227 --> 40:39.103
Greg?

40:39.145 --> 40:41.313
Allie, I need your help.

40:44.191 --> 40:46.443
Hey!

40:47.486 --> 40:48.821
They just showed upwith a warrant.

40:48.821 --> 40:49.822
They're searching the house.

40:49.822 --> 40:50.906
Don't worry.This is a good thing.

40:50.948 --> 40:53.325
A good thing?How do you figure?

40:53.367 --> 40:54.660
Because you aren'tgonna find anything.

40:54.702 --> 40:55.661
This will only help your case.

40:55.661 --> 40:58.038
I'm not so sure about that.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.248
Beretta 84,

41:00.291 --> 41:01.292
Wait. I can explain this.

41:01.333 --> 41:02.501
Greg Adams,you're under arrest for--

41:02.543 --> 41:03.836
-That's not even my---No, don't say anything.

41:03.878 --> 41:04.879
...The murder of Kevin Davis.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.213
You have the rightto remain silent.

41:06.255 --> 41:08.048
Anything you say canand will be used against you...

41:08.090 --> 41:09.175
Sorry, Allie.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.467
...You have the rightto speak to an attorney.

41:10.509 --> 41:12.428
You have the rightto have an attorney present...

41:13.471 --> 41:15.598
[car engine starting]

41:20.352 --> 41:22.188

Welcome to Picture PerfectPhotography,

41:37.912 --> 41:40.623
where every pictureis perfect.

41:41.874 --> 41:42.917
Oh, hi.

41:42.958 --> 41:44.710
How can I help you?

41:44.710 --> 41:46.170
I'm Sarah Davis.

41:46.212 --> 41:49.715
Yeah, I-I know.I'm so sorry for your loss.

41:49.757 --> 41:50.633
Thank you.

41:50.674 --> 41:51.884
I'm here because

41:51.884 --> 41:54.470
my parents would likethe photos from the wedding...

41:55.387 --> 41:58.724
Just the ones of Kevinand our family, please.

41:58.766 --> 42:00.893
Yeah. We'll upload themon the gallery

42:00.935 --> 42:02.061
and send you the link.

42:02.102 --> 42:04.188
Thank you.

42:07.441 --> 42:09.652
Oh, and we can send youphysical copies, too,

42:09.693 --> 42:10.611
if you'd like.

42:10.653 --> 42:12.988
That would be nice.

42:14.990 --> 42:18.035
Have you... seen Jenna?

42:19.453 --> 42:20.454
No.

42:20.496 --> 42:24.458
Uh, but Allie visitedher mom the other day.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.460
I think she's staying there.

42:26.502 --> 42:30.422
I just wonderedif she requested copies, too.

42:30.422 --> 42:32.466
No. No, I don't think so.

42:32.508 --> 42:33.550
[scoffs softly]

42:33.592 --> 42:36.679
Why am I not surprised?

42:37.763 --> 42:39.890
[door bell chimes]

42:43.644 --> 42:44.895
Thank you.

42:44.937 --> 42:46.146
No, thank you.

42:46.188 --> 42:48.649
I just want to go overa few details with you.

42:48.691 --> 42:50.693
I heardthey arrested Greg.

42:50.734 --> 42:51.610
We did.

42:51.610 --> 42:53.696
Do you think that he did it?

42:55.406 --> 42:57.533
We subpoenaedGreg's phone records

42:57.574 --> 42:58.742
over the last week.

42:58.784 --> 43:01.787
He received multiple callsfrom the same number...

43:01.829 --> 43:04.248
yours.

43:05.082 --> 43:07.543
I know what that looks like,but it's not what it seems.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.211
Greg and Iwere just friends.

43:09.253 --> 43:10.212
Just friends?

43:10.254 --> 43:11.922
He tried to stop your wedding.

43:11.964 --> 43:12.881
He was worried about me.

43:12.923 --> 43:15.134
I was undera lot of pressure,

43:15.134 --> 43:17.011
and Greg was helping methrough it.

43:17.052 --> 43:18.304
What kind of pressure?

43:18.345 --> 43:19.388
Well...

43:19.430 --> 43:21.724
it's no secretthat Kevin's family thought

43:21.765 --> 43:23.809
that marrying mewas beneath him,

43:23.809 --> 43:25.894
and I did everything I couldto change their minds,

43:25.936 --> 43:27.396
but nothing I didwas ever enough.

43:27.438 --> 43:28.355
Well, did Greg know

43:28.397 --> 43:29.565
that you were havingsecond thoughts

43:29.606 --> 43:30.441
about getting married?

43:30.482 --> 43:32.693
I wasn't havingsecond thoughts.

43:32.735 --> 43:34.236
I wanted to marry Kevin.

43:35.571 --> 43:37.531
Are you surethat Greg knew that?

43:44.288 --> 43:45.998
I'm gonna pay you backthe bail money, Allie,

43:46.040 --> 43:47.082
every cent.

43:47.124 --> 43:49.335
I know you will.Don't even worry about that.

43:49.335 --> 43:50.544
It's funny, huh?

43:50.586 --> 43:53.255
I was always the big brother,and now... [scoffs]

43:53.297 --> 43:54.882
Hey, I want to help you.

43:54.923 --> 43:57.635
I just... I need you to be100% honest with me.

43:57.676 --> 43:58.677
I am.

43:58.677 --> 44:00.888
Allie, it's not even my gun.

Belonged to Dad.

44:02.014 --> 44:04.850
I just forgot I had ituntil all of this.

44:04.892 --> 44:06.852
I believe you.I just...

44:07.686 --> 44:10.564
Is there anything elseyou want to tell me?

44:10.606 --> 44:11.607
No.

44:11.648 --> 44:15.361
No, I've told you everything.

44:15.361 --> 44:16.320
I promise!

44:18.030 --> 44:20.199
Okay.

44:35.964 --> 44:39.635
Yes, my father recently passedand, um,

44:39.677 --> 44:42.221
[tearfully]...left it to me.

44:42.221 --> 44:43.681

May he rest in peace.

44:45.974 --> 44:47.976
My condolences.

44:49.395 --> 44:51.814
What exactlyare your plans for this?

44:52.815 --> 44:54.400
Well...

44:54.441 --> 44:57.027
you're a development company,

44:57.069 --> 45:00.823
so I would like to, um...

45:00.864 --> 45:02.449
develop it.

45:02.491 --> 45:04.827
-Of course.-Of course.

45:06.870 --> 45:12.710
The first step is to set upa time to survey the area.

45:13.877 --> 45:15.462
Does...

45:15.504 --> 45:17.423
April 16th work?

45:17.464 --> 45:20.426
Let me just consult my...

45:21.343 --> 45:23.595
I believe I couldaccommodate that.

45:23.595 --> 45:26.098
I do havean important luncheon.

45:26.098 --> 45:28.726
Um... [coughs]

45:30.227 --> 45:31.228
Sorry.

45:34.148 --> 45:35.107

[♪♪]

46:14.313 --> 46:15.522
How'd it go?

46:15.564 --> 46:18.442
And they said I didn't havethe range for Ophelia.

46:18.484 --> 46:20.444
Guess what Mr. Crosshad penciled in

46:20.486 --> 46:22.488
in the last two weeks?

46:22.529 --> 46:24.406
"The Firing Line."

46:24.448 --> 46:25.949
What's that?

46:25.991 --> 46:28.285
It's a gun range.

46:31.580 --> 46:32.998
[bell chimes]

46:33.040 --> 46:34.666
I can't believeit took all morning

46:34.708 --> 46:35.667
to post Greg's bail.

46:35.709 --> 46:37.336
Finally, you're here.

46:37.336 --> 46:38.504
Is everything okay?

46:38.545 --> 46:41.340
I want to show you♪ something...

46:41.340 --> 46:42.299
Check this out.

46:42.341 --> 46:44.176
Jenna's initialconsultation notes.

46:44.218 --> 46:46.804
When we firstmet Jenna about the wedding,

46:46.845 --> 46:48.514
this is what she saidabout the wedding party.

46:49.348 --> 46:50.974
"Four bridesmaids,four groomsmen."

46:51.016 --> 46:54.186
Yep, and this is a shot...

46:54.228 --> 46:55.354
from the wedding.

46:55.395 --> 46:57.523
Four bridesmaids...

46:58.524 --> 47:00.192
...three groomsmen.

47:00.192 --> 47:02.528
So who's missing?

47:06.657 --> 47:08.700
His name is Brandon Stiles.

47:08.742 --> 47:10.160
He's Kevin's brother.

47:10.202 --> 47:11.411
Wait, brother?

47:11.453 --> 47:13.705
Fraternity brother. They went to college together.

47:13.705 --> 47:15.707
So why wasn'the at the wedding?

47:15.749 --> 47:18.502
He came down witha bad stomach flu that morning.

47:18.544 --> 47:19.586
So he flew

47:19.628 --> 47:21.713
all the way out for the weddingbut didn't go?

47:21.713 --> 47:23.715
He didn't wantto get anyone else sick.

47:23.757 --> 47:25.425
He wouldn't miss itotherwise, believe me.

47:25.467 --> 47:27.719
They were very close.

47:27.761 --> 47:28.887
Got it. All right.

47:28.887 --> 47:31.390
Thanks, Jenna. Bye.

47:31.431 --> 47:33.183
Well, that was a dead-end.

47:33.225 --> 47:36.103
Wouldn't be so sureabout that.

47:36.144 --> 47:38.605
Meet Brandon Stiles.

47:39.898 --> 47:41.858
Remind you of anyone?

47:45.237 --> 47:48.448
He kind of does look likeyour brother, huh?

47:51.785 --> 47:53.871
[♪♪]

48:01.086 --> 48:02.546
[knocking at door]

48:21.440 --> 48:22.441
Hello.

48:22.441 --> 48:23.525
Hi.

48:24.610 --> 48:27.487
Sorry, I'm not usedto seeing you so casual.

48:27.529 --> 48:29.990
Well, it is my day off.

48:30.032 --> 48:30.907
No offense,

48:30.949 --> 48:32.242
but you seem likethe kind of guy

48:32.284 --> 48:34.161
who would wear a suite and tieon vacation.

48:34.202 --> 48:35.746
Can I come in?

48:35.787 --> 48:37.831
Sure.

48:37.873 --> 48:40.584
How did you find me?

48:40.626 --> 48:42.961
I do all the headshotsfor the local realtors,

48:42.961 --> 48:44.463
so just made a few calls.

48:44.504 --> 48:46.340
Small town.

48:46.381 --> 48:47.549
Hey, it's still alive!

48:47.591 --> 48:51.929
Yeah, I-I guess I'm notas hopeless as I thought.

48:55.807 --> 48:57.142
Well...

48:57.142 --> 48:58.560
what are youwaiting for?

49:00.354 --> 49:01.813
Give me a tour.

49:01.813 --> 49:03.440
Tour, yes.

49:03.482 --> 49:07.694
All right, well,this is my house...

49:07.736 --> 49:08.779
obviously.

49:08.820 --> 49:10.822
Uh, there's actuallysome great hardwood

49:10.864 --> 49:11.907
under this linoleum,

49:11.949 --> 49:13.992
so I'm gonna tear it upand restore it.

49:13.992 --> 49:16.036
Oh, I know a great contractor,if you need one.

49:16.078 --> 49:18.580
Oh, no, I'm gonna doall the work myself.

49:19.623 --> 49:21.583
You ever renovateda house before?

49:21.625 --> 49:24.294
No. I'm not afraidof a little hard work.

49:24.336 --> 49:26.505
[clunk]

49:27.589 --> 49:28.799
A little?

49:28.840 --> 49:32.594
I was gonna replace it anyways,so, um...

49:32.636 --> 49:34.012
If I can just...

49:34.054 --> 49:35.263
If I can just show you...

49:36.682 --> 49:37.641
the other room.

49:37.683 --> 49:39.643
So how doesa New York City detective

49:39.685 --> 49:42.354
end up in the Willow HavenSheriff's Department?

49:42.354 --> 49:44.356
You've beenchecking up on me?

49:44.398 --> 49:45.899
It's a small town.

49:47.275 --> 49:49.236
[sighs] Ah. Well...

49:49.277 --> 49:52.364
I needed a change,

49:52.364 --> 49:54.616
and New York...

49:56.118 --> 49:57.703
...had too many memories.

50:01.415 --> 50:02.749
Good or bad?

50:05.419 --> 50:06.586
Anyways, um...

50:06.628 --> 50:10.382
I was interviewinga witness on a cold case.

50:10.382 --> 50:12.342
We had a DNA hit.

50:12.384 --> 50:14.553
They wanted me to pursue it,

50:14.553 --> 50:16.513
and, well,I drove by the house,

50:16.555 --> 50:18.348
saw the "for sale" sign,and...

50:18.390 --> 50:19.558
that was pretty much it.

50:19.558 --> 50:22.352
Seriously?That's all it took?

50:22.394 --> 50:24.271
[chuckles] Yeah.

50:24.312 --> 50:26.064
I think it wasthe first impulsive thing

50:26.064 --> 50:28.442
I've ever done in my life.

50:32.571 --> 50:33.572
Um...

50:33.613 --> 50:35.949
but yeah, drove down,got out of the car.

50:35.991 --> 50:39.911
I stood right herein the front of the yard.

50:39.911 --> 50:41.288
I looked back at the house,

50:41.329 --> 50:44.458
and there was justthis sun rising behind it.

50:44.499 --> 50:46.585
It just felt...

50:46.626 --> 50:48.336
It felt full of possibility.

50:48.378 --> 50:52.215
Possibilityand mustard paint.

50:53.383 --> 50:55.427
Yeah, the paint.

50:57.179 --> 50:59.431
You play?

50:59.431 --> 51:00.849
I dabble.

51:00.891 --> 51:02.476
Correspondence game?

51:02.517 --> 51:04.352
Yes, yes.

51:04.394 --> 51:07.564
Um, it's actually meand my Uncle Luis.

51:07.606 --> 51:09.941
We've been playing chess by mailfor years.

51:09.983 --> 51:12.944
He taught me everything.He's a cop...

51:12.944 --> 51:13.945
Well, he was a cop.

51:13.945 --> 51:15.030
He's retired now,

51:15.072 --> 51:17.783
but he always says chessis an officer's game

51:17.783 --> 51:20.660
because you always have to beone step ahead of the opponent.

51:20.702 --> 51:22.954
Hmm.

51:22.996 --> 51:24.247
This you?

51:24.289 --> 51:25.165
Uh-huh.

51:25.207 --> 51:29.002
Um, Knight to H6.

51:30.545 --> 51:33.256
I would be walkingright into a trap.

51:33.298 --> 51:35.675
Sacrifice.Leaves his King vulnerable.

51:35.717 --> 51:38.470
Then, in three moves,it's checkmate.

51:40.680 --> 51:42.015
You "dabble"?

51:42.057 --> 51:44.017
I like puzzle games.

51:44.893 --> 51:47.145
Always had an eye for detail.

51:47.187 --> 51:50.440
You know, me too...

51:50.482 --> 51:54.027
which is why I am wonderingwhat you really want.

51:54.069 --> 51:55.403
Is it that obvious?

51:55.445 --> 51:57.114
Well, no one's gonnadrive all the way out here

51:57.155 --> 51:58.323
just to talk about spackle.

51:58.365 --> 52:01.743
Okay, Brandon Stiles.

52:01.785 --> 52:03.078
One of Kevin's groomsmen.

52:03.119 --> 52:05.121
Well, he was supposed to be,but he missed the ceremony.

52:05.163 --> 52:06.873
So you alreadyknow about him?

52:07.833 --> 52:10.293
Detective.

52:11.211 --> 52:12.462
The day of the ceremony,

52:12.504 --> 52:14.464
I overheard Kevin arguingwith someone on the phone,

52:14.506 --> 52:15.841
saying notto attend the wedding.

52:15.882 --> 52:17.092
I think that was Brandon.

52:17.134 --> 52:19.010
-Miss Adams---It's Allie.

52:19.010 --> 52:20.428
Sure.

52:20.470 --> 52:24.057
Look, I know this is probablyreally difficult for you,

52:24.099 --> 52:27.394
and I admire your tenacity,I really do,

52:27.435 --> 52:29.729
but there's only one personwith motive and opportunity

52:29.771 --> 52:31.148
to kill Kevin Davis,

52:31.189 --> 52:32.732
and that was your brother.

52:32.774 --> 52:34.067
[inhales sharply]

52:34.109 --> 52:36.236
So you're not gonnalook into this?

52:37.195 --> 52:38.113
I'm sorry.

52:39.489 --> 52:42.450
No, no, I-I'm sorryto bother you.

52:42.492 --> 52:44.536
I'll see myself out.

52:46.621 --> 52:48.123
[door opens and shuts]

52:52.544 --> 52:55.380
[♪♪]

53:40.175 --> 53:42.802
[♪♪]

53:46.598 --> 53:47.682
Going in?

53:48.600 --> 53:50.226
Uh, no. Thank you.

53:50.268 --> 53:52.270
I-I was just lookingat the...

53:52.270 --> 53:53.855
menu.

53:53.897 --> 53:56.399
[phone rings]

53:59.653 --> 54:02.447
Captain Johns, hi.

54:02.447 --> 54:04.532
Yeah.

54:05.784 --> 54:07.994
What?

54:10.372 --> 54:13.166
The fire department put meon indefinite suspension.

54:13.208 --> 54:14.626
Can they do that?

54:14.668 --> 54:16.461
Captain Johns fought for me,

54:16.503 --> 54:18.546
but the Davis family hasfar too much influence

54:18.588 --> 54:19.506
in this town.

54:19.547 --> 54:20.799
The firehouseis like a family to me.

54:20.799 --> 54:22.425
It's more than just a job.

54:22.467 --> 54:24.010
I can't lose that to this.

54:28.473 --> 54:31.685
I know things seem bleakright now...

54:32.978 --> 54:36.147
...but we're gonnaget through this.

54:36.147 --> 54:38.316
Have you talked to Jenna?

54:39.985 --> 54:43.446
No, I just want to knowhow she's doing.

54:43.488 --> 54:46.700
I mean, she's coping...

54:46.741 --> 54:48.034
but she's strong.

54:48.076 --> 54:49.577
I mean,Jenna's really strong.

54:50.495 --> 54:52.580
Yeah, she is.

54:54.499 --> 54:57.961
I just wishthere was something I could do,

54:58.003 --> 55:00.005
you know, to fix this.

55:03.008 --> 55:06.594
I think the best thing for her,and for you right now,

55:06.636 --> 55:08.555
is to just give her some space.

55:12.517 --> 55:13.977
[sighs]

55:14.019 --> 55:15.353
Yeah.

55:17.981 --> 55:20.859
Thanks.

55:20.900 --> 55:22.986
What are sisters for?

55:31.619 --> 55:32.871
Gentlemen.

55:32.912 --> 55:34.039
Ballistics came back

55:34.039 --> 55:35.874
on the gun we foundat the Adams' residence.

55:35.874 --> 55:38.335
It hasn't been fired recently.

55:38.376 --> 55:39.586
Well...

55:39.627 --> 55:41.629
maybe it's timewe open up the case.

55:41.671 --> 55:44.090
Take a look atsome of the other guests.

55:44.132 --> 55:45.717
Well, we may nothave the right gun,

55:45.717 --> 55:47.927
but we have the right guy.

55:49.179 --> 55:51.556
Let's open it up.

55:52.974 --> 55:55.351
[Sam] We've spokento a few people who believe

55:55.393 --> 55:56.895
you opposed the marriage.

55:56.895 --> 55:57.771
Is that true?

55:57.812 --> 56:00.106
Can I pour you a glass?

56:00.148 --> 56:01.483
No, thank you.

56:01.524 --> 56:02.984
Okay.

56:04.903 --> 56:07.572
I suspectedJenna had ulterior motives

56:07.572 --> 56:09.199
for marrying Kevin.

56:10.283 --> 56:13.703
And it seems my suspicionswere confirmed.

56:13.745 --> 56:14.746
Well, Jenna insiststhat she had

56:14.746 --> 56:15.747
nothing to dowith Kevin's murder.

56:15.789 --> 56:18.541
[chortles]I'm sure she does.

56:18.583 --> 56:20.043
You don't believe her?

56:21.544 --> 56:23.546
I loved my son, Detective,

56:23.588 --> 56:25.965
but he could be impetuous.

56:26.007 --> 56:29.260
I built this fortune for him...

56:31.888 --> 56:33.640
And he was preparedto throw it away

56:33.681 --> 56:35.391
for a girlwho didn't love him.

56:36.393 --> 56:38.770
Kevin considered cutting tieswith Davis Development.

56:38.770 --> 56:41.898
Do you think that's becauseof Miss Cole's influence?

56:41.940 --> 56:43.483
Of course I do!

56:43.525 --> 56:44.609
She was nothing but trouble

56:44.651 --> 56:47.195
since the dayhe brought her home.

56:47.237 --> 56:49.030
Mr. Davis,

56:49.072 --> 56:50.573
Kevin ever raise any concerns

56:50.615 --> 56:53.576
about any business practicesat your company?

56:54.911 --> 56:57.163
I'm not surewhat you're getting at here,

56:57.205 --> 56:58.289
Detective Acosta.

56:58.331 --> 56:59.457
He was learning a new role.

56:59.457 --> 57:00.375
-Correct?-Yes.

57:00.416 --> 57:01.751
New responsibilities.

57:01.793 --> 57:05.171
Anything that he might havequestioned about your operation?

57:06.923 --> 57:08.383
[phone rings]

57:11.136 --> 57:12.595
This is the funeral home.

57:12.637 --> 57:14.931
Excuse me.I've got to take this.

57:17.308 --> 57:19.811
Hello?

57:19.853 --> 57:21.104
Where'd that come from?

57:21.146 --> 57:23.857
Ah, something Sarah Davis saidjust got me thinking.

57:23.898 --> 57:25.817
Well, when did you planon telling me about it?

57:25.817 --> 57:26.985
I don't know.

57:27.026 --> 57:28.778
I'm-- I'm sorry, Nick,I'm still getting used

57:28.820 --> 57:30.780
to this whole partner thing.

57:30.822 --> 57:33.658
Uh-huh, and how longdo you think that's gonna take?

57:34.742 --> 57:36.578
Look at this.

57:36.619 --> 57:40.081
Quite the collection.

57:40.123 --> 57:42.125
Notice anything?

57:44.752 --> 57:47.046
[Nick] One of them's missing.

57:51.259 --> 57:54.721
So, how did you getBrandon Stiles' room number?

57:54.762 --> 57:56.306
I just asked.

57:56.347 --> 57:57.974
That works.

57:58.016 --> 58:00.226
How did you knowhe's still here?

58:00.268 --> 58:02.270
Oh, Jenna said he wasstaying for the funeral.

58:02.312 --> 58:03.980
What if he's really sick?

58:04.022 --> 58:05.857
I brought him chicken soup.

58:07.192 --> 58:08.485
[knocking]

58:08.526 --> 58:10.153
Housekeeping!

58:12.405 --> 58:14.282
Look, I don't thinkhe's gonna answer.

58:14.324 --> 58:16.201
He's got to come out sometime.

58:16.201 --> 58:18.912
What are you gonna do,stake the place out?

58:20.413 --> 58:22.582
[♪♪]

58:38.389 --> 58:39.599
[knocking]

58:43.478 --> 58:45.438
[window whirs]

58:46.356 --> 58:47.565
Good evening, Detective.

58:47.607 --> 58:49.817
Everything all right,Miss Adams?

58:49.859 --> 58:51.903
Peachy.

58:52.904 --> 58:54.155
What are you up to?

58:54.989 --> 58:57.534
I was on my way to a gigand I got a phone call,

58:57.575 --> 59:00.161
so I pulled over to take it,

59:00.203 --> 59:02.121
because safety first.

59:02.163 --> 59:02.997
Oh.

59:03.039 --> 59:04.541
And you happened to stop here,

59:04.582 --> 59:05.750
right in front of the motel

59:05.792 --> 59:08.419
where Brandon Stileshappens to be checked into?

59:08.461 --> 59:11.214
Really?

59:11.256 --> 59:12.757
What are the odds?

59:12.799 --> 59:14.217
Slim to none, I would guess.

59:15.218 --> 59:16.552
What are you doing here?

59:16.594 --> 59:21.307
Could it be that you suspectI was right about Mr. Stiles?

59:21.349 --> 59:22.392
Is that Thai?

59:22.433 --> 59:23.351
It is.

59:23.393 --> 59:25.144
I like Thai.

59:32.277 --> 59:34.779
So I guess you twohadn't drifted as far apart

59:34.779 --> 59:35.822
as you thought.

59:35.863 --> 59:37.448
Hmm?

59:37.448 --> 59:39.158
You and Greg.

59:39.200 --> 59:42.620
I mean, for you to go throughall this to help him out,

59:42.662 --> 59:43.746
just...

59:43.788 --> 59:44.789
Wow.

59:44.789 --> 59:45.790
He's my family.

59:45.790 --> 59:48.585
I'm just doingwhat anyone else would.

59:48.626 --> 59:50.586
A late-night stakeoutin a motel parking lot?

59:50.628 --> 59:52.297
Yeah.

59:52.338 --> 59:55.091
Greg has alwaysbeen there for me.

59:55.133 --> 59:58.761
He had a scholarshipto a college,

59:58.803 --> 01:00:01.055
and after my parents died,

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:03.433
he stayed with mehere in Willow Haven

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.344

01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:40.386

Did Kevin knowhow you felt?

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:53.811

I was just looking out for him.

01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:02.653
So then he kicked youout of the wedding party?

with the jobthat he offered you,

01:03:48.699 --> 01:03:51.827

01:04:01.879 --> 01:04:03.464

Look, he didn't go into detail,

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:23.401

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:45.078
sometimes, what I leave out

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:46.831
is just as importantas what I put in.

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:48.290
I don't follow.

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:49.834
I'm sayingjust forget about everything

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:52.127
and focus on the detailthat keeps tripping you.

01:08:52.169 --> 01:08:54.337
Okay.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.549
That's not a bad idea.

01:09:00.344 --> 01:09:03.805
Okay, well, I'm gonna go.

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:06.475
Maybe you could help me.

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:09.687
I mean, you were therethat night, so...

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:12.314
I already told youeverything I know.

01:09:12.356 --> 01:09:13.232
I'd like you to show me.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:14.649
Show you?

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:16.109
Please?

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:25.870
So... lights go out.

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:26.871
Mm-hmm.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:29.456
Kevin and Jennacome to the dance floor.

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:31.250
Uh... yeah, that's right.

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:32.459
And then what?

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:34.837
Well, they hadtheir first dance.

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:36.462
First dance...

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:37.840
okay.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.261
Indulge me?

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:43.595
Oh, uh...

01:09:44.638 --> 01:09:46.140
Okay.

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.558
Like this?

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.934
Yeah.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:52.104
What happened next?

01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:55.190
They spun around the rooma couple times.

01:09:56.483 --> 01:09:57.443
Will you lead?

01:09:57.484 --> 01:09:59.904
Okay. Um...

01:09:59.945 --> 01:10:00.905
Sorry.

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:03.616
Sort of like this...

01:10:03.657 --> 01:10:05.242
Like that.

01:10:05.284 --> 01:10:09.121
Um... and then she spun out.

01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:11.415
Uh-huh, uh-huh...

01:10:14.293 --> 01:10:15.753
It was right...

01:10:15.794 --> 01:10:18.422
They ended up right...

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:20.341
right here.

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:23.594
This doesn't make any sense.

01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:24.762
The angles are all off.

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:25.763
The shooterwas on the right side

01:10:25.804 --> 01:10:26.847
of the dance floor.

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:28.265
Bullet pierced his chest.

01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:30.267
He-- He dipped her...

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:31.560
like this.

01:10:34.355 --> 01:10:36.899
This would givethe killer a clear shot.

01:10:36.941 --> 01:10:38.067
Yeah.

01:10:44.114 --> 01:10:45.366
Okay, Miss Adams.

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:47.660
That was... uh...That was very helpful.

01:10:47.701 --> 01:10:49.244
No, thank you.I'm-I'm glad I could help.

01:10:49.286 --> 01:10:51.455
-Thank you.-Yeah.

01:10:52.456 --> 01:10:55.125
[♪♪]

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:10.808
Let me make this clear.

01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:11.934
I intend to sue you

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:13.394
and the entireWillow Haven Police Department

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.938
for this gross infringementof my rights.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.356
Kevin Davis was gathering

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:19.149
information and evidencethat would have proven

01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:22.569
years of fraudulent accountingby Cross.

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:24.655
He'd stolen hundredsof thousands of dollars

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:26.657
from his clientsand the firm.

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:29.243
And Crossknew what Kevin was doing?

01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:30.953
Maybe...

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.246
but if he did,

01:11:32.287 --> 01:11:34.707
it would make for a prettycompelling motive for murder,

01:11:34.748 --> 01:11:36.792
don't you think?

01:11:37.918 --> 01:11:39.795
I'll pass on the message.Thank you very much.

01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:40.713
Hi.

01:11:40.754 --> 01:11:43.632
Hello. I have a packagefor Sarah Davis.

01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:44.675
I'll be happyto give that to her.

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:46.844
Oh, is she in?I was hoping to see her.

01:11:46.885 --> 01:11:48.595
She is, but I shouldgive that to her.

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:51.140
Right, but she's a friend.

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:55.519
Fine.

01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:56.854
Last door on the right.

01:11:56.895 --> 01:11:58.480
Thank you.

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:03.861
[knocking on glass]

01:12:03.902 --> 01:12:05.112
Allie...

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.613
What are you doing here?

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:09.533
I came to drop off your photos.

01:12:09.533 --> 01:12:11.327
You could have left themwith reception.

01:12:11.368 --> 01:12:12.494
I know how importantthey are to you,

01:12:12.536 --> 01:12:14.997
so I wantedto ensure their delivery.

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:17.416
Well... thank you.

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:21.211
What do I owe you?

01:12:21.253 --> 01:12:23.464
No, no, it's on the house.

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:32.806
That's my grandfather'sbow tie he's wearing.

01:12:33.724 --> 01:12:36.185
See how it's a little too big?

01:12:36.226 --> 01:12:37.936
Kevin didn't care.

01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:46.153
I'm so sorry.

01:12:47.237 --> 01:12:48.572
No.

01:12:48.572 --> 01:12:50.240
I'm sorry.

01:12:50.282 --> 01:12:52.493
I know I wasn't exactly...

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.787
pleasant to youthe day of the wedding.

01:12:54.828 --> 01:12:56.246
No, it's fine.

01:12:56.288 --> 01:12:57.247
There's something about tragedy

01:12:57.289 --> 01:12:59.625
that makes youre-evaluate things.

01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:01.919
I owe Jenna one, too.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.754
I stopped by her mother'shouse this morning,

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:04.963
but she wasn't home.

01:13:05.005 --> 01:13:08.050
Jenna's staying atmy family's cabin for a few days

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:10.302
so she can clear her head.

01:13:10.344 --> 01:13:11.762
That's a good idea.

01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:12.805
Yeah.

01:13:12.846 --> 01:13:15.224
I think we could alluse a little space.

01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:23.857
Sarah,

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:27.361
I was hoping to ask you a fewquestions about Bill Cross.

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.654
What about him?

01:13:28.695 --> 01:13:32.116
I know he and Kevin didn'talways see eye-to-eye on things.

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:36.036
Bill is... ambitious.

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.540
He always has been.

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:41.458
[knocking on glass]

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:42.751
I'm sorry, Miss Davis.

01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:44.002
The courierwon't release a package

01:13:44.044 --> 01:13:45.546
without your signature.

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:46.630
Excuse me for one minute.

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:48.757
It's okay.

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:01.353
[♪♪]

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.640
[♪♪]

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:48.692
[♪♪]

01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:55.991
You lied to me.

01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:57.159
What?

01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:59.369
I asked if there wasanything you weren't telling me.

01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:01.413
You said I kneweverything there was to know.

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:02.664
Allie, you do.

01:15:02.706 --> 01:15:04.249
I've always beenhonest with you.

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:06.126
I spoke to May, the florist.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:08.128
She saidyou sent someone flowers.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.963
I assumed it was Jenna,but Sarah?

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:11.882
[sighs heavily]

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:12.966
We met at a fundraiser

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:14.760
at the firehousea couple of months ago.

01:15:14.801 --> 01:15:16.053
We hit it off.

01:15:16.094 --> 01:15:17.304
Why didn't you tell anybody?

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.639
Because, between Kevinand Jenna,

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.557
we just thought it was betterto keep it to ourselves,

01:15:20.557 --> 01:15:22.518
at least while it was so new.

01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:25.562
So what, you guys are dating?

01:15:25.562 --> 01:15:26.563
Yeah, we were.

01:15:26.563 --> 01:15:27.731
Took her out a few times,

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:30.651
we went up to the cabinfor an afternoon, but...

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:31.652
a few weeks ago,

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:33.362
I realizedmy heart wasn't in it.

01:15:33.403 --> 01:15:36.823
That's not fair to anyone,so I broke it off.

01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:40.619
How did she take it?

01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:43.747
Not well.

01:15:49.336 --> 01:15:50.504
Whatcha looking for?

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:51.421
This.

01:15:51.463 --> 01:15:52.923
The bullet came from

01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:54.967
the right sideof the dance floor...

01:15:55.008 --> 01:15:57.427
and there's Sarah.

01:15:57.469 --> 01:15:59.846
Why would Sarahshoot her own brother?

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:02.015
I don't know...

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.559
unless she didn't mean to.

01:16:04.476 --> 01:16:07.854
[♪♪]

01:16:15.279 --> 01:16:18.323
What if she wasn'taiming for Kevin?

01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:21.118
What if the dip is what madethe bullet miss her true target?

01:16:21.159 --> 01:16:23.745
[overlapping] Jenna!

01:16:28.625 --> 01:16:29.876
[knocking at door]

01:16:38.051 --> 01:16:39.052
Sarah?

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:40.512
We just gotsome horrible news about Kevin.

01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:42.139
What is it?

01:16:42.139 --> 01:16:43.432
Can I come in?

01:16:48.478 --> 01:16:50.814
Hi! You've reached Jenna. I can't come to the phone now.

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:52.482
Leave a message at the tone.

01:16:52.482 --> 01:16:54.735
Jenna, it's Allie.Call me.

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:55.610
No luck?

01:16:55.652 --> 01:16:56.945
No, she's probablyat the cabin,

01:16:56.987 --> 01:16:57.946
so she won't have service.

01:16:57.988 --> 01:16:59.281
So what are we going to do?

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:00.657
Email Detective Acostadirections to the cabin.

01:17:00.657 --> 01:17:01.783
I'm headed up there.

01:17:01.825 --> 01:17:04.619
-You think that's a good idea?-Probably not.

01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:05.787
[door shuts]

01:17:05.829 --> 01:17:08.749
And that's not stopping her.

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.167
[phone rings]

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:11.585
-Acosta.-Jenna's in danger.

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:14.504
I think the shooterwas aiming for her that night.

01:17:14.504 --> 01:17:15.631
-The shooter?-Sarah!

01:17:15.672 --> 01:17:16.590
Sarah Davis?

01:17:16.631 --> 01:17:18.300
Jenna's stayingat our family's cabin.

01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:19.301
I'm headed there now.

01:17:19.343 --> 01:17:20.636
Noah's aboutto email you directions.

01:17:20.677 --> 01:17:22.179
Don't do anything stupidand let us handle this, okay?

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.264
-I got to go.-Miss Adams!

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:25.223
Miss Adams!

01:17:25.265 --> 01:17:27.267
Sam?

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:29.227
We got to go.

01:17:29.269 --> 01:17:31.521
[♪♪]

01:17:42.366 --> 01:17:43.658
Jenna?

01:17:45.619 --> 01:17:47.287
[pounding]

01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:55.879
Allie!What are you doing here?

01:17:55.879 --> 01:17:57.339
Jenna, I need youto come with me.

01:17:57.381 --> 01:17:58.673
What's going on?

01:17:58.715 --> 01:18:00.008
I thinkyou might be in danger.

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:02.094
Danger?What do you mean?

01:18:02.135 --> 01:18:04.888
I think she means me.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:06.473
[Jenna] Sarah? What...

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:08.225
Hello, Allie.

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:12.229
Why don't youjoin us inside, hmm?

01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:16.858
[Nick] Go to the left,go to the left!

01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:19.736
Allie, what's going on?

01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:21.279
Why is she doing this?

01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:23.240
Greg didn't shoot Kevin.

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:24.241
Sarah did.

01:18:24.282 --> 01:18:25.909
What? Why?

01:18:25.909 --> 01:18:28.078
Because the bullet missed you.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.454
You were trying to kill me?

01:18:29.496 --> 01:18:30.497
You deserved it.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.499
For making a foolout of Kevin...

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:33.458
out of me.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.543
A fool out of you?

01:18:34.584 --> 01:18:36.086
How...
