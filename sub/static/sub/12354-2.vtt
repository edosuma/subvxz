00:02.326 --> 00:05.428
<i>A lot of weird stuff
happened that night.</i>

00:05.462 --> 00:06.329
I blacked out...

00:07.564 --> 00:09.499
<i>So, did we...?</i>

00:09.533 --> 00:10.867
I don't remember, either.

00:10.901 --> 00:12.602
My name is
Julianne Hofschraeger,

00:12.636 --> 00:14.971
and I am the interim ceo.

00:15.005 --> 00:17.807
We are promoting
Jeannie Van Der hooven.

00:17.841 --> 00:19.776
Got the big old
please-don't-sue-us promotion.

00:19.810 --> 00:21.010
You're the new Jesus Christ,

00:21.045 --> 00:23.313
and I am counting on you
to close like a motherfucker.

00:23.347 --> 00:24.347
Mr. Pincus?

00:24.381 --> 00:25.348
We're gonna build

00:25.382 --> 00:26.582
a better goddamn casino.

00:26.617 --> 00:27.417
Casino!

00:27.451 --> 00:28.418
You're goddamn right.

00:28.452 --> 00:29.419
Fuckin' Vegas, baby!

00:29.453 --> 00:30.486
Vegas!

00:31.388 --> 00:32.922
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:32.957 --> 00:34.657
I love you.

01:08.993 --> 01:10.960
Oh, man.

01:10.995 --> 01:12.795
Ah! You see that?

01:12.830 --> 01:14.230
Viva Las Vegas, baby!

01:14.264 --> 01:16.099
Or should I say,
"viva lost wages?"

01:16.133 --> 01:17.266
You ever heard that?

01:17.301 --> 01:18.968
Well, you know,
maybe to be safe,

01:19.003 --> 01:20.670
you just shouldn't say
anything at all.

01:20.704 --> 01:21.871
Ah, you know what, Clyde?

01:21.905 --> 01:23.840
Your words can't
hurt me. Not here.

01:23.874 --> 01:27.543
Uh-uh. Not in the most
majestic city in the world.

01:27.578 --> 01:30.513
God, where the eiffel
tower is a stone's throw

01:30.547 --> 01:32.315
from a venetian gondola.

01:32.349 --> 01:34.417
Where if you want
to walk from a...

01:34.451 --> 01:37.086
A giant slot machine to a
world-class art gallery,

01:37.121 --> 01:39.522
all you need to do is
cross the bellagio lobby.

01:39.556 --> 01:40.990
Simple as that.
Mm.

01:41.025 --> 01:43.226
Tickets to the museum
will cost you 15 bucks,

01:43.260 --> 01:45.895
but as the poster out front
says, it's worth the monet.

01:45.929 --> 01:47.063
I'm excited.

01:47.097 --> 01:48.231
Oh, yeah.
I can tell.

01:48.265 --> 01:50.366
Marty, this is where Jeannie
would usually jump in.

01:50.401 --> 01:51.601
You crushed it, guggenheim.

01:51.635 --> 01:52.935
Yes! Oh, no, no. The other thing.

01:52.970 --> 01:54.871
Oh, shut the fuck up, Doug.

01:54.905 --> 01:56.439
Shut the fuck up, Doug.

01:56.473 --> 01:59.042
Hey, did you know Vegas
has a sister city in China?

01:59.076 --> 02:01.611
Yeah-- huludau.
Oh.

02:01.645 --> 02:04.280
This is it, boys.

02:04.314 --> 02:05.948
Soak it in.

02:05.983 --> 02:07.950
Does it get any
better than this?

02:10.120 --> 02:12.021
Oh.
Oh, my God.

02:13.590 --> 02:15.391
Come on. Faded glory.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.694
Once you've lived with the gods,
you can't wait to get

02:18.729 --> 02:20.263
a taste of that sweet nectar,

02:20.297 --> 02:24.233
as it trickles down your throat
one more time.

02:24.268 --> 02:26.369
This place is just in need

02:26.403 --> 02:30.139
of a little love,
and we have just the magic. Huh?

02:30.174 --> 02:31.474
Stating the obvious

02:31.508 --> 02:33.843
and making a fat old check
disappear in our pockets?

02:33.877 --> 02:35.278
Hut, ho...

02:35.312 --> 02:36.446
♪ Ta-da!
♪ ta-da!

02:39.116 --> 02:41.117
Hey, Jeannie.

02:41.151 --> 02:42.718
Thanks for coming.

02:42.753 --> 02:43.986
Sure.
Oh, oh, careful.

02:44.021 --> 02:47.323
This is how things got
started with the last guy.

02:50.527 --> 02:53.262
So, um, I know that
you know, at this point,

02:53.297 --> 02:54.831
that I have made a, uh,

02:54.865 --> 02:58.167
pretty successful career
helping wayward companies.

02:58.202 --> 03:01.003
Mm... "The titan of turnaround."

03:01.038 --> 03:03.606
Hot new erp,

03:03.640 --> 03:05.408
or asset reduction
plan is always

03:05.442 --> 03:07.677
gonna make the headlines,
but, um,

03:07.711 --> 03:10.813
do you know
what the secret sauce is

03:10.848 --> 03:13.116
in every successful bounceback?

03:15.085 --> 03:17.420
This is a wild guess,
but is it the people?

03:17.454 --> 03:20.356
Boilerplate, okay, yes.

03:20.390 --> 03:22.125
But that's because it's true.

03:22.159 --> 03:23.759
You find the best people,

03:23.794 --> 03:25.228
and you cultivate 'em.

03:25.262 --> 03:28.598
Now, I know
that you and I have just met...

03:28.632 --> 03:30.299
Actually we met a few years

03:30.334 --> 03:31.801
back... briefly.

03:31.835 --> 03:33.102
I volunteered
when you ran for governor.

03:35.472 --> 03:37.807
Really thought
you were going to win, too.

03:37.841 --> 03:38.975
Yeah, so did I.

03:40.310 --> 03:42.979
Well, I guess you wouldn't have
spent $100 million

03:43.013 --> 03:44.280
of your own money if you didn't

03:44.314 --> 03:45.348
think you were, right?

03:45.382 --> 03:46.516
Yes. You know,

03:46.550 --> 03:48.050
that number has been overstated.

03:48.085 --> 03:49.385
Oh.

03:49.419 --> 03:51.154
Jeannie, um...

03:51.188 --> 03:53.556
I asked you here today because

03:53.590 --> 03:56.325
I would like to play
a mentor role for you.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.161
I can't... I-I can't

03:58.195 --> 04:00.796
even imagine
how that must have felt.

04:00.831 --> 04:01.864
If I lose a quarter

04:01.899 --> 04:02.965
in the soda machine,

04:03.000 --> 04:04.867
my day entire day-- ruined.

04:04.902 --> 04:07.970
And you lost
400 million quarters.

04:10.874 --> 04:12.842
Wow. I, um...

04:12.876 --> 04:14.977
I feel like

04:15.012 --> 04:18.414
you're not embracing the spirit
of what I'm offering.

04:18.447 --> 04:20.216
Mm.

04:20.250 --> 04:23.219
That's because I feel like the
spirit of what you're offering

04:23.221 --> 04:24.620
is horseshit.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.622
You don't care about me.

04:26.657 --> 04:29.058
If you did, I would have gotten
a real promotion,

04:29.092 --> 04:32.562
and not an empty title bump,
and you certainly

04:32.596 --> 04:35.464
wouldn't have hired a bunch
of women above me.

04:35.499 --> 04:36.933
You don't want to mentor me.

04:36.967 --> 04:38.501
You want to fire me.

04:38.535 --> 04:40.369
You want to fire all
of the whistleblowers,

04:40.404 --> 04:42.972
but you can't,
because what you do

04:43.006 --> 04:44.974
care about is
avoiding a lawsuit.

04:46.843 --> 04:49.579
You're not going to sue.

04:49.613 --> 04:52.081
It would make you poison
out there.

04:52.115 --> 04:54.550
But you know that.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.185
But what you don't

04:56.220 --> 04:58.120
seem to grasp is that

04:58.155 --> 05:00.990
while firing all
the whistleblowers is indeed

05:01.024 --> 05:02.592
not a viable option,

05:02.626 --> 05:06.095
we could get away
with firing one,

05:06.129 --> 05:09.832
especially if she's not
measuring up professionally.

05:09.866 --> 05:11.901
Now, your work

05:11.935 --> 05:13.102
here has been excellent.

05:13.136 --> 05:14.370
I presume that won't change?

05:14.404 --> 05:16.372
But, um, sometimes things

05:16.406 --> 05:17.607
are just... whew!

05:17.641 --> 05:19.742
Th are beyond our control.

05:19.776 --> 05:22.245
Millions of years,
dinosaurs ruled the planet.

05:22.279 --> 05:25.514
Then this meteor just falls
out of the sky and poof,

05:25.549 --> 05:27.917
no more dinosaurs.

05:27.951 --> 05:30.653
We have hired

05:30.687 --> 05:33.856
an impressive set of gals.

05:33.890 --> 05:35.858
A couple of 'em

05:35.892 --> 05:38.194
came highly recommended
by, uh, Marty...

05:39.529 --> 05:43.232
whose opinion
I know you trust quite a bit.

05:43.267 --> 05:46.335
Is this supposed to scare me?

05:46.370 --> 05:48.170
Whew...

05:48.205 --> 05:49.972
As if that's possible.

05:51.241 --> 05:54.677
No, the hotshot young

05:54.711 --> 05:56.612
consultant...

05:56.647 --> 05:58.614
On the fast track to partner

05:58.649 --> 06:01.984
who starts fuckin' her boss,
just in case...

06:03.687 --> 06:05.421
A girl like that...

06:07.090 --> 06:10.026
she's not afraid of anything.

06:15.465 --> 06:16.666
Hello, dear.

06:16.700 --> 06:17.867
Hey.
Hi.

06:17.901 --> 06:19.335
From galweather stearn.
You can go in.

06:19.369 --> 06:20.903
Great.
Your associate's

06:20.937 --> 06:22.672
already in with
Mr. Pincus.

06:22.706 --> 06:24.340
Our... associate?

06:24.374 --> 06:25.875
Is in there?

06:25.909 --> 06:27.877
Are you sure?

06:27.911 --> 06:30.246
I thought Jeannie didn't
get here till this afternoon.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.381
Your
grandson-- he's adorable.

06:32.416 --> 06:33.649
Oh, yeah. You have children?

06:33.684 --> 06:34.950
I do. Two
girls-- five and three.

06:34.985 --> 06:36.886
Oh. You got your
hands full.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.754
I don't think that's Jeannie.

06:38.789 --> 06:39.889
Mr. Pincus.

06:39.923 --> 06:40.990
Hey.

06:41.024 --> 06:42.158
Oh.

06:42.192 --> 06:43.426
Marty.

06:43.460 --> 06:45.227
Good to see you again, sir.

06:45.262 --> 06:46.329
Good to see you.

06:46.363 --> 06:47.663
I see you've met Tamara.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.099
Oh, she's fantastic.
Where did you find this one?

06:50.133 --> 06:51.600
Uh, found her right here.

06:51.635 --> 06:52.601
Yeah. Terrific.

06:52.636 --> 06:54.837
Thought you started next week.

06:54.871 --> 06:56.005
Ah. Nope.
No?

06:56.039 --> 06:57.173
Uh-uh.

06:57.207 --> 06:58.808
So...

06:58.842 --> 07:01.477
The emerald's had a good run,
but if you've been downstairs,

07:01.511 --> 07:02.912
you know
something's got to give.

07:02.946 --> 07:03.813
Yeah.
Yeah.

07:03.847 --> 07:04.747
Is it a major remodel?

07:04.781 --> 07:07.650
Do I start fresh
from a new location?

07:07.684 --> 07:10.319
Well, we'll...
I was thinking, you've got...

07:10.354 --> 07:12.188
Mm, yeah. Yeah.
Okay.

07:12.222 --> 07:14.757
Uh, well, we'll run the
numbers on both, uh,

07:14.791 --> 07:16.759
as well as exploring
the cost-benefit

07:16.793 --> 07:19.795
of various style options.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.764
Now, does the new emerald stick
with an old-school vibe,

07:21.798 --> 07:24.300
or does it go in the direction
of a place like the vibrato?

07:24.334 --> 07:25.167
The vibrato?

07:25.202 --> 07:26.102
Yes, sir.

07:26.136 --> 07:27.269
Fuck that shitty casino.

07:30.107 --> 07:30.906
Okay.

07:30.941 --> 07:32.908
And the carpetbagging fuck

07:32.943 --> 07:35.678
who fucking built it.

07:35.712 --> 07:39.281
I'm gonna build a fucking ass
clown nightclub of a casino?!

07:39.316 --> 07:41.684
I'd sooner
you shit down my throat!

07:41.718 --> 07:43.519
Fucking vibrato!

07:43.553 --> 07:45.254
<i>Fucking fuck fuck!</i>

07:48.859 --> 07:50.326
You'd prefer

07:50.360 --> 07:51.694
something classy,

07:51.728 --> 07:54.597
elegant, but contemporary.

07:54.631 --> 07:56.632
Exactly. She gets it.

07:56.666 --> 07:57.933
She's a peach.

07:57.968 --> 07:59.869
<i>So, uh,</i>

07:59.903 --> 08:01.470
Berkeley?
That surprises me.

08:01.505 --> 08:03.806
Yeah, we were one
and two in our class.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.040
One... two.

08:05.075 --> 08:06.776
Of course. Yeah.

08:06.810 --> 08:08.010
Huh.

08:08.044 --> 08:09.378
It's just Berkeley.
It is Berkeley, yeah.

08:09.413 --> 08:10.546
Blowing your mind, right.
Kind of.

08:10.580 --> 08:11.814
Yeah?

08:11.848 --> 08:13.482
I mean, who knew they even
had a business school?

08:13.517 --> 08:14.717
Lot of people.
I guess.

08:14.751 --> 08:15.885
No, I didn't, though.
I didn't.

08:15.919 --> 08:17.119
I'm not surprised.
No, not me.

08:17.154 --> 08:18.687
I knew they had a great football team.

08:18.722 --> 08:20.589
Oh, yeah, they certainly have
Harvard beat on that count.

08:20.624 --> 08:22.124
Oh. That's where
I went-- Harvard.

08:22.159 --> 08:23.325
Oh, of course.
Yeah.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.527
We got it.
We got it.

08:24.561 --> 08:25.828
What was he like back then?

08:25.862 --> 08:27.129
Oh, Marty.
Let's see.

08:27.164 --> 08:28.798
He, um...
He wore cornrows.

08:28.832 --> 08:30.366
What?! He wore cornrows?

08:30.400 --> 08:32.701
He'd play his guitar
all the time,

08:32.736 --> 08:34.102
even though
he only knew one song.

08:34.136 --> 08:35.337
- Oh, man.
- Cornrows.

08:35.371 --> 08:36.972
<i>God, were you awful.
God, was the song awful.</i>

08:37.006 --> 08:38.240
Yeah. What was the
name of the song again?

08:38.275 --> 08:39.408
"Smoke on the water."
Right.

08:39.443 --> 08:40.609
Ooh!
Ooh!

08:40.644 --> 08:41.910
What a terrible gift
you just gave me.

08:41.945 --> 08:43.312
What? "Smoke on the water"?

08:43.346 --> 08:44.547
Don't listen to him, Marty. Daddy!

08:44.581 --> 08:46.081
That song kicks major ass.

08:46.116 --> 08:47.750
I don't need the help, Doug.

08:47.784 --> 08:49.318
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:49.352 --> 08:52.588
Hey...

08:53.824 --> 08:55.124
I don't really like surprises.

08:55.158 --> 08:56.559
Uh, actually,
you love surprises,

08:56.593 --> 08:59.228
as long as you're the one
keeping people off-balance.

08:59.262 --> 09:01.864
Oh, Marty, I've been out

I don't have time
to be delicate.

I am not here to outshine you.

09:06.703 --> 09:08.304
Well, good luck
if you are, boo,

Hey. Hi.

Hey.

09:18.548 --> 09:21.517
How was, uh, your
meeting with Julianne?

09:21.551 --> 09:23.519
Oh, great.

09:23.553 --> 09:24.920
I had sex with her.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.555
Oh.
You know me.

09:26.590 --> 09:29.024
I see a senior partner, I
cannot keep my hands off of them.

09:29.059 --> 09:30.192
That is true.

09:30.227 --> 09:31.861
At least she's cuter
than the rainmaker.

09:31.895 --> 09:33.963
And she thinks there's more
to foreplay than, uh,

09:33.997 --> 09:35.865
"hang on, let me
take off my glasses."

09:35.899 --> 09:37.500
Yech.

Uh, where are the boys?

09:38.902 --> 09:40.436
Oh, uh, they're having lunch.

09:40.470 --> 09:42.505
At the emerald.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.910
Uh, Clyde and I are gonna go to
this club later and tear it up,

if you wanted to...

09:49.279 --> 09:51.447

10:01.725 --> 10:05.027
Listen, I feel like, um...

10:05.061 --> 10:07.463
We're really dancing
around each other,

10:07.497 --> 10:09.365
and-and I was hoping
we could...

10:09.399 --> 10:11.267
Let it remain really awkward.

10:11.301 --> 10:13.068
We are very much
on the same page now.

10:13.103 --> 10:15.070
Best for everybody.
Hm.

10:15.105 --> 10:17.139
All right.
I'm gonna...

10:17.173 --> 10:19.074

Uh, how's that
Parker house roll, man?

I don't know, man;
Haven't had it yet.

10:29.286 --> 10:31.353
Do you want to grab one for
yourself? No. Certainly not.

10:31.388 --> 10:33.088
Certainly not. Okay.

10:33.123 --> 10:34.290
Wow.

10:34.324 --> 10:35.591
Oh, yeah, pasta salad.

10:35.625 --> 10:38.460
Make sure you get a big ol'
scoop of that, buddy.

10:38.495 --> 10:39.795
Is there a problem, Douglas?

10:39.829 --> 10:42.665
Not for the casino, Clyde.
Not by a long shot. Yeah.

10:42.699 --> 10:44.967
I'm factoring in
the bulk price of the penne,

10:45.001 --> 10:47.903
the olive oil, pimento,
as well as labor costs.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.705
Each statistical unit
of pasta salad

10:49.739 --> 10:52.441
is valued at, oh, I don't know,
roughly three cents.

10:52.475 --> 10:54.510
Who cares! I'm so bored
right now. Meanwhile...

10:54.544 --> 10:56.278
Don't say "meanwhile" -- it means
you're gonna keep going.

10:56.313 --> 10:57.746
Meanwhile, the equivalent
serving of shrimp

10:57.781 --> 10:59.949
requires a layout
of well over a dollar.

10:59.983 --> 11:01.116
Oh!
Fact.

11:01.151 --> 11:02.685
Open your eyes, Clyde.
Don't you see

11:02.719 --> 11:04.353
what's going on here?
The buffet's rigged!

11:04.387 --> 11:06.755
No way! They got cheap
product up here at the front,

11:06.790 --> 11:08.157
no! And meanwhile, the big-ticket items

11:08.191 --> 11:09.625
are here right at the back,

11:09.659 --> 11:12.328
so that by the time dupes
like you get to the shrimp,

11:12.362 --> 11:13.696
your plate's already full.

11:13.730 --> 11:14.830
Well, I don't even like shrimp.

11:14.864 --> 11:15.831
Huh? That's
not the point.

11:15.865 --> 11:17.232
How is that not the point?

11:17.267 --> 11:18.834
Personally, I can
take or leave shrimp.

11:18.868 --> 11:21.136
If I'm being honest, I think
I'm a little allergic to it.

11:21.171 --> 11:23.706
But today I am gonna gorge
myself on it! Do you know why?

11:23.740 --> 11:25.207
Because you're a fuckin' idiot?

11:25.241 --> 11:27.910
<i>'Cause I'm not a fucking idiot.</i>

11:27.944 --> 11:29.478
Nice try, pal.

Oh, hey, Jeannie.
We're just over here.

11:33.383 --> 11:36.785
Oh, Jeannie, Jeannie,
Jeannie, Jeannie.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.854
You actually missed
an amazing flight.

11:38.888 --> 11:41.123
Marty confessed to everything
that hpened on that night.

11:41.157 --> 11:42.658

he was very complimentary.

How stupid do you
think I am, Clyde?

11:44.894 --> 11:46.528
I think...
Don't answer that.

11:46.563 --> 11:47.863
Yeah. Are you guys going back to caesars

11:47.897 --> 11:49.298
after this, or are we gonna

11:49.332 --> 11:51.033
get some work done?
Well, once Douglas

11:51.067 --> 11:53.302
single-handedly wipes out the
earth's shrimp population...

11:53.336 --> 11:55.237
Yeah, for real?
What is going on?

11:55.271 --> 11:57.039
Good question. Buffet's rigged.
Do not. Do not.

11:57.073 --> 11:58.307
Good-good question. No!

11:58.341 --> 11:59.842

11:59.876 --> 12:01.677
We're gonna sift through
some data. Tamara?

12:01.711 --> 12:03.646
As in Marty's b-school
friend Tamara?

12:03.680 --> 12:04.980

Yeah.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.582
Oh, you're gonna love her.

12:06.616 --> 12:09.118
She's great. She's srt,
tough, easy on the eyes.

12:09.152 --> 12:10.819
Kind of like a black Jeannie.

12:10.854 --> 12:12.421
I mean, not like a black, uh,

12:12.455 --> 12:14.223
genie, you know?
But like a black...

12:14.257 --> 12:15.357
You know what I mean.

12:15.392 --> 12:17.526
Why don't you judge
for yourself.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.161
Oh, hey!

12:19.195 --> 12:21.630
Hi, Tamara. It's a pleasure
to meet you. I'm...

12:21.665 --> 12:23.799
Jeannie, yeah.
Your legend precedes you.

12:25.235 --> 12:26.635
Okay.
Hi, guys.

12:26.670 --> 12:28.537
Hi.

12:28.571 --> 12:30.539
Should we get some work done?

12:30.573 --> 12:31.640
Well, maybe give us
five minutes.

12:31.675 --> 12:32.708
No, we don't need five minutes.

12:32.742 --> 12:35.010
Let's pop down some...
Doug guggenheim?

12:36.713 --> 12:38.681
No. Huh? No, uh,

12:38.715 --> 12:40.315
Doug guggenheim here.
Sir,

12:40.350 --> 12:42.051
you know you've been banned
from all betting areas.

12:42.085 --> 12:43.118
You need to leave.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.453
What's going on, guys?

12:44.487 --> 12:45.788
No idea.
I have absolutely no idea.

12:45.822 --> 12:47.022
How is this...

12:47.057 --> 12:49.758
Keno? You're
booting me out for keno?

12:49.793 --> 12:51.160
Like I'd waste

12:51.194 --> 12:52.294
my God-given
talent on keno.

12:52.328 --> 12:53.362
If I have to ask again,

12:53.396 --> 12:54.830
it's gonna be far less pleasant.

12:54.864 --> 12:55.964
No need for that, sir.

12:55.999 --> 12:57.266
No need to make a scene.
I'm leaving.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.034
It's not problem at all.
Put down the shrimp.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.402
Well, now we
have a problem. Sir,

13:00.437 --> 13:02.237
I paid $7.99 for this shrimp,
it is coming with me,

13:02.272 --> 13:03.172
and there is not a goddamn...

13:03.206 --> 13:04.373
Oh, yes!

13:04.407 --> 13:07.509
Put down the goddamn shrimp.

13:07.544 --> 13:10.345
All right! All right.
This doesn't end here.

13:11.281 --> 13:12.815
Oh! He's got one in his mouth!

13:12.849 --> 13:14.249
He's got one in his mouth!

13:16.219 --> 13:17.853
I have no idea
what that just was,

13:17.887 --> 13:20.255
what?! But it was the single
best moment I've ever seen

13:20.290 --> 13:21.323
in my entire life!

13:21.357 --> 13:22.424
Do it again!

13:22.459 --> 13:23.992
Do it again! Do it...

13:24.027 --> 13:26.562
It was a major
card-counting operation.

13:26.596 --> 13:29.298
Up and down the strip.
And it was Doug's system.

13:29.332 --> 13:30.365
Wow!
Yeah.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.967
And how much did the gugg make?

13:32.001 --> 13:34.136
Dude, his share was
well into six figures.

13:34.170 --> 13:35.504
But this happens--

13:35.538 --> 13:37.239
he has an attack of guilt,

13:37.273 --> 13:40.175
decides to give all of his money
to a homeless charity.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.811
Oh, you dumb-ass. "Oh, you
dumb-ass" doesn't explain it,

13:42.846 --> 13:44.680
'cause then,
a couple days later,

13:44.714 --> 13:47.015
he has second thoughts,
goes to the charity

13:47.050 --> 13:49.284
to try to get his
fuckin' money back.

13:49.319 --> 13:52.421
Dirk mcgirt! Dirk mcgirt
comes in with powerpoints

13:52.455 --> 13:54.356
and graphs, tries
to make the case

13:54.390 --> 13:56.458
that having easy access
to food and blankets

13:56.493 --> 13:59.194
actually makes the homeless
more vulnerable

13:59.229 --> 14:02.631
when they're released
back into nature.

14:02.665 --> 14:04.299
You can't say "back
into nature" when

14:04.334 --> 14:06.201
you're talking about
people. Human beings. I know.

14:06.236 --> 14:08.303
Opening shots have been fired.

14:08.338 --> 14:10.906
You're at war, gentlemen.

14:10.940 --> 14:12.040
We surrender.
We do.

14:12.075 --> 14:13.041
We'll sign a treaty!

14:13.076 --> 14:14.877
Please! Okay.

14:14.911 --> 14:16.945
Oh, here... yo!
Dushkin!

14:16.980 --> 14:19.882
Dushkin! Oh...!

14:19.916 --> 14:22.751
Ugh. I apologize. I
apologize ahead of time.

14:22.786 --> 14:25.120
But these guys are
good for business.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.555
What's up, man?

14:26.589 --> 14:28.490
I feel your dick a lot now.

14:28.525 --> 14:30.592
Yes!

14:30.627 --> 14:32.427
Marty, Marty,

14:32.462 --> 14:34.329
this is Kyle and Alex dushkin.

14:34.364 --> 14:36.431
They own this place.
How you doing?

14:36.466 --> 14:38.600
What's up? Oh. There
we go. Nice to meet you.

14:38.635 --> 14:39.635
Sweet threads!

14:39.669 --> 14:41.303
So, you're in town

14:41.337 --> 14:43.005
consulting with Pincus, right?

14:43.039 --> 14:44.773
That's the truth.

14:44.808 --> 14:45.774
My dude Carlson

14:45.809 --> 14:47.309
fucked his shit up!

14:47.343 --> 14:49.845
Pincus had his eyes
on this site.

14:49.879 --> 14:51.613
Carlson rolls into town,
hoovered it out

14:51.648 --> 14:53.615
from under Pincus
to put up the vibrato.

14:53.650 --> 14:56.518
It was epic!
Oh. Put up the vibrato.

14:56.553 --> 14:58.287
Carlson is the shit!

14:58.321 --> 15:00.088
Fantastic. Wish I'd known
about that this morning.

15:00.123 --> 15:01.790
Might've helped. Fuck. Marty,

15:01.825 --> 15:04.593
can you turn around
so I can check out the vent?

15:04.627 --> 15:06.295
I don't think
I'm gonna do that.

15:06.329 --> 15:08.163
All right, Marty.

15:08.198 --> 15:10.299
My brother's a total
Peter puffer about clothes.

15:10.333 --> 15:13.035
I swear, one day I'm gonna need
to give him the heimlich,

15:13.069 --> 15:14.203
'cause he'll have a dick

15:14.237 --> 15:15.337
stuck in his throat!

15:15.371 --> 15:16.905
Oh!
Whoo!

15:16.940 --> 15:18.173
I didn't hear
any complaints when I

15:18.208 --> 15:20.943
was burying it deep and wide
in his stepsister's ass!

15:20.977 --> 15:22.377
Oh, yeah!
Ooh! Ooh!

15:22.412 --> 15:23.645
Enjoy your night.

15:23.680 --> 15:24.646
Thank you, my man.

15:24.681 --> 15:26.114
Do that.
Whoa! Yo!

15:26.149 --> 15:28.483
We love it! Oh, oh!
Aw...!

15:28.518 --> 15:30.319
Good to see you.
Marty.

15:36.125 --> 15:37.593
Oh...

15:37.627 --> 15:38.861
Wow.
Yep.

15:38.895 --> 15:39.862
And...

15:39.896 --> 15:41.263
Wow.

15:41.297 --> 15:42.631
The real wow?
Yeah.

15:42.665 --> 15:44.266
Five years ago, those guys,

15:44.300 --> 15:46.702
they're running the door
at a series of clubs.

15:46.736 --> 15:50.539
Now, a whole lot of hustle and
fuckin' zero shame later... yeah?

15:50.573 --> 15:52.841
Revenue is up $50 million.

15:52.876 --> 15:55.010
Stop. 50 fuckin' million dollars.

15:55.044 --> 15:56.645
Look at them.

15:56.679 --> 15:58.714
50 fuckin' million dollars
those guys have!

15:58.748 --> 15:59.982
Douchebag twins!

16:00.016 --> 16:01.350
Only in America.

16:01.384 --> 16:03.752
It's actually dushkin.

16:03.786 --> 16:05.754
I got it. It's my fault. Yeah.

16:05.788 --> 16:07.289
I apologize.

16:09.325 --> 16:12.628
Do you want me to give
it to you straight or curvy?

16:12.662 --> 16:15.063
Give it to me straight.
Go. There's greater flexibility

16:15.098 --> 16:16.298
with a new build.

16:16.332 --> 16:17.766
Yeah, which is more than offset

16:17.800 --> 16:18.867
by the value of the real estate!

16:18.902 --> 16:20.135
Do you want to explain
to me why this idiot

16:20.169 --> 16:21.737
isn't at the meeting?
Yeah, well, Doug

16:21.771 --> 16:24.206
is not allowed here, and we
don't want to fuckin' hang out

16:24.240 --> 16:25.707
where he likes to hang out.

16:25.742 --> 16:27.509
You see your man over there? Oh, yeah.

16:27.543 --> 16:29.411
Hey! Hey, Marty!

16:29.445 --> 16:30.579
Jesus, I'm sorry, guys.

16:30.613 --> 16:31.680
Right. So this is how.

16:31.714 --> 16:33.382
Can you see me?
We'll do this.

16:33.416 --> 16:34.549
Yeah, whatever, Doug. I mean, obviously,

16:34.584 --> 16:36.351
we're still gonna have
to prepare the deck,

16:36.386 --> 16:37.619
but I think we can put a stake

16:37.654 --> 16:38.921
in the ground at our dinner
with Pincus tonight.

16:38.955 --> 16:40.188
I mean, the remodel's
the way to go.

16:40.223 --> 16:41.823
What do you think, Tamara?

16:41.858 --> 16:43.158
Um, I actually...

16:43.192 --> 16:44.826
Well, it's
pretty clear-cut, Marty.

16:44.861 --> 16:46.728
The numbers kind of
speak for themselves.

16:46.763 --> 16:48.196
Speaking for themselves--
that's a novel idea.

16:48.231 --> 16:49.665
Why don't we let Tamara

16:49.699 --> 16:51.500
do that.

16:51.534 --> 16:52.935
I focused

16:52.969 --> 16:54.703
on a web-based strategy.

16:54.737 --> 16:55.837
Like online poker?

16:55.872 --> 16:57.706
That kind of thing?
I've played it. I've played it,

16:57.740 --> 16:59.174
If you guys need
to know anything about that.

16:59.208 --> 17:00.442
I'm just gonna lower the
No, no,

17:00.476 --> 17:02.277
more sweeping, more sweeping.
A full-scale,

17:02.312 --> 17:04.613
pay model gambling app
that integrates

17:04.646 --> 17:05.914
into existing social media.

17:05.949 --> 17:07.015
And if Pincus

17:07.050 --> 17:09.351
were to acquire one...
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

17:09.385 --> 17:11.453
yes, yes, you could re-brand
the physical casino

17:11.487 --> 17:13.588
and bring in
a major new revenue stream.

17:13.623 --> 17:15.589
That's actually fuckin'
brilliant. Exactly.

17:15.625 --> 17:17.693
Fuck off, would you?!

17:17.727 --> 17:20.095
Is he getting beat up?

17:20.128 --> 17:22.330
Hold on a second, guys. Can you
hear me now? Can you hear me now?

17:22.365 --> 17:23.332
Yeah, I can hear you.
You're yelling

17:23.366 --> 17:24.333
in my fucking face.
Get away from me.

17:24.367 --> 17:25.534
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

17:25.568 --> 17:26.801
Oh, watch out, I know karate,
man... I know karate!

17:26.836 --> 17:28.537
Do you want to die
twice, motherfucker?

17:28.570 --> 17:30.005
Get the fuck out of here.

17:30.039 --> 17:31.440
Here's the one thing

17:31.474 --> 17:34.343
that that doesn't consider,
is that it is illegal

17:34.377 --> 17:37.112
for money to exchange hands
in cyberspace. Uh, it is,

17:37.146 --> 17:39.414
for now,
but I expect that to change.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.550
Well, what if it doesn't?

17:41.584 --> 17:42.651
Or what if it doesn't

17:42.685 --> 17:43.719
within ten years?

17:43.753 --> 17:45.153
Or within 20 years?

17:45.188 --> 17:47.923
And, uh, good old Pincus
is pissing in his diaper

17:47.957 --> 17:50.892
in a nursing home somewhere
unable to afford

17:50.927 --> 17:52.160
his pudding cup.
The law

17:52.195 --> 17:53.628
is gonna change, Jeannie.

17:53.663 --> 17:55.497
Unless it doesn't.

17:55.531 --> 17:56.898
Well, it will,

17:56.933 --> 17:58.834
because politicos
won't be able to resist

17:58.868 --> 18:00.302
the potential tax revenues.

18:00.336 --> 18:02.337
Unless they can!

18:02.372 --> 18:04.506
Uh, you know, Jeannie,

18:04.540 --> 18:06.808
I've actually been doing
a lot of reading on this...

18:06.843 --> 18:08.944
Oh, well, if you've been doing
reading, then I'll shut up.

18:08.978 --> 18:10.779
Uh, would you?
Because that would be great.

18:10.813 --> 18:12.247
Oh...

18:12.281 --> 18:15.150
Listen, I know that you have
been spending a lot of time

18:15.184 --> 18:16.418
with little babies,

18:16.452 --> 18:18.687
and that that's super hard,

18:18.721 --> 18:20.422
and God bless mothers,
but for those of us that

18:20.456 --> 18:21.590
have been in the grown-up world,

18:21.624 --> 18:24.593
what you need to realize
okay, Jeannie, uh, Jeannie...

18:24.627 --> 18:25.634
Is that it's unprecedented...
Ah-ah,

18:25.661 --> 18:27.462
Jeannie, Jeannie.
Take it easy.

18:27.497 --> 18:30.332
<i>You want me to take it easy?
Yeah, take it easy,</i>

18:30.366 --> 18:31.700
Jeannie bean.
Well, I don't...

18:31.734 --> 18:34.169
She's off the reservation,
Marty bean.

18:34.203 --> 18:36.772
Okay? You can't tear apart
our entire analysis

18:36.806 --> 18:39.174
based on an article that
you read. Do you know

18:39.208 --> 18:42.544
my friend Sam foster, the deputy
Attorney General of the United States?

18:42.578 --> 18:44.146
Because he seems

18:44.180 --> 18:46.081
to think that
it's gonna be a done deal.

18:47.984 --> 18:50.952
A social media portfolio
makes a shitload of sense.

18:50.987 --> 18:53.288
That being said... eh...

18:53.322 --> 18:55.757
Convincing an old-school guy
like Pincus

18:55.792 --> 18:58.260
to have any real buy
into this is gonna be a slog.

18:58.294 --> 18:59.494
Yes.

18:59.529 --> 19:00.695
So we're gonna go
with the remodel.

19:01.831 --> 19:02.931
You happy now?

19:02.965 --> 19:04.099
Great.

19:04.133 --> 19:05.600
Can I get two gin
and tonics, please?

19:05.635 --> 19:06.902
Well, guys, here's what I think.

19:06.936 --> 19:08.603
Uh, can you... can you hear me?

19:08.638 --> 19:10.205
So, what's the next step?

19:10.239 --> 19:13.475
Uh, well, we will get
you a formal set of numbers

19:13.509 --> 19:15.010
by close of business tomorrow.

19:15.044 --> 19:16.244
And next day, you start
meeting architects.

19:16.279 --> 19:17.546
That soon?

19:17.580 --> 19:19.381
Oh, yeah. Time is
Absolutely.

19:19.415 --> 19:21.316
Where'd you learn that?
The fucking vibrato?

19:22.318 --> 19:23.885
It's actually a pretty

19:23.920 --> 19:24.853
popular catchphrase...

19:24.887 --> 19:25.854
You have to bear with me--

19:25.888 --> 19:26.788
I'm like a goddamn snail

19:26.823 --> 19:28.156
when it comes to change.

19:28.191 --> 19:29.391
But I'll get there.
Oh, don't worry about it.

19:29.425 --> 19:30.459
I mean...

19:30.493 --> 19:32.027
- This is the move, right?
- Oh, yeah.

19:32.061 --> 19:32.861
Absolutely.
100%.

19:32.895 --> 19:33.895
Yes, sir.

19:33.930 --> 19:36.898
Tamara? What?

19:36.933 --> 19:40.402
You favor the...
The new build?

19:40.436 --> 19:41.403
Um...

19:41.437 --> 19:42.471
Well,

19:42.505 --> 19:43.839
to be honest, I think

19:43.873 --> 19:45.574
both options are mistakes.

19:45.608 --> 19:47.909
I'd probably go in a
completely different direction.

19:49.045 --> 19:50.745
Could you excuse us
for a moment, Mr. Pincus?

19:50.780 --> 19:52.247
Sure.

19:52.281 --> 19:53.648
Can I talk to you over here?

19:53.683 --> 19:55.650
Excuse me, sir.

19:58.254 --> 20:00.155
That's a nice-looking

20:00.189 --> 20:01.356
jacket, man.
Where'd you get it?

20:01.390 --> 20:03.058
Your mother.

20:04.060 --> 20:05.460
So what the hell
are you thinking?

20:05.495 --> 20:07.362
If he goes down
either one of those roads,

20:07.396 --> 20:08.663
it's gonna turn off the lights.

20:08.698 --> 20:10.465
Yeah, maybe it will,
maybe it won't.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.734
But more to the point,
who gives a shit? I do.

20:12.768 --> 20:14.369
I've spent years
developing my brand.

20:14.403 --> 20:15.971
Oh, my God.
Could you hold my hair?

20:16.005 --> 20:17.572
'Cause I think I'm
gonna throw up. Marty,

20:17.607 --> 20:20.442
if a client asks a question, I'm
gonna give him an honest answer.

20:20.476 --> 20:23.545
We are a team, okay? That's
what that pod is in there.

20:23.579 --> 20:26.515
If there's a dispute, guess who's
the tiebreaker. Oh, so I'm supposed to

20:26.549 --> 20:29.351
break out my pom-poms and
sis-boom-bah for the remodel?

20:29.385 --> 20:30.952
Yeah, like we got a chance
at that after the piss

20:30.987 --> 20:32.420
you took all over it in there.

20:32.455 --> 20:35.056
"Hey, Mr. Pincus, I know that
we said rehabbing your casino

20:35.091 --> 20:36.958
"was a terrible idea.

20:36.993 --> 20:38.360
"We didn't mean it. J.K.

20:38.394 --> 20:39.995
It's opposite day."

20:40.029 --> 20:41.630
I thought you were smarter
than this.

20:41.664 --> 20:43.798
I thought that you were smarter.
Marty, you're a great salesman,

20:43.833 --> 20:46.134
but when a job's done, how much
repeat business do you see?

20:46.169 --> 20:47.202
I don't give

20:47.236 --> 20:49.304
a fuck about
repeat business, okay?

20:49.338 --> 20:50.972
When I'm through with a job,

20:51.007 --> 20:52.541
I'm staring at a
boatload of cash.

20:52.575 --> 20:54.643
Galweather stearn is staring
at a boatload of cash.

20:54.677 --> 20:55.677
You're getting table scraps.

20:55.711 --> 20:57.212
And what happens
when you leave galweather?

20:57.246 --> 20:58.947
If you ever leave.

21:00.082 --> 21:02.284
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, Marty,

21:02.318 --> 21:06.021
here you are, 15 years later
into your stint at galweather,

21:06.055 --> 21:09.291
dropping checks into the
laps of people you hate,

21:09.325 --> 21:13.061
eager for a pat on the
head and a "good boy."

21:14.130 --> 21:16.464
What the hell happened
to Martin kaan?

21:16.499 --> 21:18.800
You didn't hear, Tammy?

21:18.834 --> 21:20.335
I won.

21:20.369 --> 21:22.070
Vanquished my foes.

21:22.104 --> 21:24.005
Galweather stearn
is my bitch now.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.140
A bitch that's spitting out
hefty bonuses

21:25.174 --> 21:26.474
for work I could do
with my eyes closed.

21:26.509 --> 21:28.510
Now, I'm gonna go
in there and try

21:28.544 --> 21:30.111
to sweep up the mess
you just made. Do you think

21:30.146 --> 21:33.682
you can keep your mouth shut
for five minutes?

21:36.819 --> 21:38.253
Say "yeah, I can hold
for Mr. Carlson"

21:38.287 --> 21:39.321
and then get out of there.

21:39.355 --> 21:41.323
Yeah, I'll hold for Carlson.

21:46.295 --> 21:47.896
Welcome back.

21:51.867 --> 21:53.301
So...

21:53.336 --> 21:55.837
Will someone tell me
what the fuck is going on?

21:57.473 --> 21:58.373
It's, uh...

21:58.407 --> 22:00.308
It's complicated.

22:00.343 --> 22:03.511
Our team is in a, uh,
tricky position, ethically.

22:03.546 --> 22:05.280
Mm. You see, while we believe

22:05.314 --> 22:07.616
that a remodel would be
incredibly lucrative for you,

22:07.650 --> 22:09.551
we have another strategy
that would just...

22:09.585 --> 22:12.787
God, it would just blast
the dead bolt off of fort knox.

22:12.822 --> 22:15.023
Yeah, that's true.

22:15.057 --> 22:17.125
Uh, unfortunately,
we're unable to propose it

22:17.159 --> 22:19.527
at this time because we've put
it in front of another casino.

22:19.562 --> 22:21.630
Now, I don't think I'm
crossing any lines to say

22:21.664 --> 22:23.798
that this... other
guy's a tremendous

22:23.833 --> 22:25.834
asshole...
It's fucking Carlson, isn't it?

22:25.868 --> 22:27.535
Well...

22:27.570 --> 22:29.137
I'm not at liberty to say.

22:30.373 --> 22:31.473
Uh, but suffice it

22:31.507 --> 22:33.041
to say that's why Tamara

22:33.075 --> 22:35.043
would rather line
your pockets than his.

22:35.077 --> 22:37.512
And to be quite honest,
I agree with her, but

22:37.546 --> 22:39.481
as I've said, we, um...

22:39.515 --> 22:41.650
We're having trouble
squaring it ethically.

22:41.684 --> 22:43.518
And you know, Marty,

22:43.552 --> 22:45.387
if we're talking ethics,
what could be more ethical

22:45.421 --> 22:47.222
than, uh, letting
the good guy win?

22:47.256 --> 22:48.723
How's he gonna find out?
Who cares?

22:48.758 --> 22:50.825
It's not like
we're passing nuclear codes.

22:50.860 --> 22:54.229
Pincus, pincu... ow.

22:54.263 --> 22:55.897
Why don't you tighten
it up, drunky? Sorry.

22:58.100 --> 23:00.235
Well, uh...

23:00.269 --> 23:01.870
All right, I'm gonna tell
him. Sure. Do it, baby.

23:01.904 --> 23:03.438
Let's go.
I can't believe this.

23:03.472 --> 23:05.106
Okay, uh...

23:05.141 --> 23:06.675
Our guy in Washington

23:06.709 --> 23:08.743
assures us
that the restrictions

23:08.778 --> 23:10.845
to online gambling
are about to go bye-bye.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.114
So acquiring a technology
that melds

23:13.149 --> 23:16.117
casino gaming with social media

23:16.152 --> 23:18.920
and then partnering with a very
strong Vegas brand will...

23:18.954 --> 23:20.922
It's just gonna lead
to ungodly profits.

23:20.956 --> 23:24.092
Ding, ding, ding. Huge.

23:24.126 --> 23:25.694
You're gonna be right back in.

23:25.728 --> 23:27.829
Forget that. You're gonna be
fucking king of the game.

23:27.863 --> 23:29.597
You want to be the king?

23:29.632 --> 23:32.233
Social media.
That's it.

23:32.268 --> 23:34.669
Yes, it's coming, but you got
to get in front of it.

23:34.704 --> 23:36.004
As of right now

23:36.038 --> 23:38.139
there's 20 million users
playing slotomania...

23:38.174 --> 23:39.441
You know, my-my

23:39.475 --> 23:40.408
brother-in-law's
company

23:40.443 --> 23:41.443
patented something

23:41.477 --> 23:43.445
called a magnetic stent.

23:43.479 --> 23:46.147
It's a big deal
in bypass surgery. Yeah.

23:46.182 --> 23:47.882
Now, I turned down
an opportunity

23:47.917 --> 23:50.218
to get in on the ground floor.
You know why?

23:50.252 --> 23:51.553
Why?
Because...

23:51.587 --> 23:53.455
I'm bored even telling
this story.

23:53.489 --> 23:54.622
You know.

23:54.657 --> 23:55.857
I have nothing
against making money.

23:55.891 --> 23:56.891
Don't get me wrong.

23:56.926 --> 23:58.927
But I love what I do.

23:58.961 --> 24:00.829
I still get a thrill walking
through the casino,

24:00.863 --> 24:02.263
and I'm not gonna get that from

24:02.298 --> 24:03.965
a bunch of...
Faceless nobodies

24:03.999 --> 24:05.967
fingering their iPads,
waiting for their dicks

24:06.001 --> 24:07.369
to get hard again so that they

24:07.403 --> 24:09.471
- can jerk off to more porn.
- Hey, you don't have

24:09.505 --> 24:10.905
to sell that to me--
I understand.

24:10.940 --> 24:12.240
But you don't have to make...

24:12.274 --> 24:13.408
Have to make a
decision right away.

24:13.442 --> 24:14.422
If you'd just allow us...
Thank you

24:14.443 --> 24:16.444
but no thank you.

24:22.752 --> 24:25.086
Please tell me you talked to
Carlson last night at the club.

24:25.121 --> 24:26.988
If by "talk to Carlson" you mean
I didn't talk to Carlson

24:27.022 --> 24:27.989
then yeah.

24:28.023 --> 24:29.657
Great. And, uh,

24:29.692 --> 24:31.659
what do you propose we do now?

24:31.694 --> 24:33.495
You take it, drunky.

24:33.529 --> 24:37.832
Carlson, Carlson, Carlson,

24:37.867 --> 24:39.501
Jeannie.
Carlson...

24:39.535 --> 24:43.238
Carlson, Carlson...

24:47.610 --> 24:48.576
I'm not implying

24:48.611 --> 24:51.012
that you guys don't know
Carlson.

24:51.046 --> 24:52.514
I'm just saying...

24:52.548 --> 24:54.048
Look, we don't just
know the dude.

24:54.083 --> 24:55.083
We're seriously tight.

24:55.117 --> 24:57.218
Really?
Yeah. Like peas in a bowl.

24:57.253 --> 24:58.686
He's here all the fucking time.

24:58.721 --> 25:00.889
Well... not all
the fucking time.

25:00.923 --> 25:03.491
I mean, where is this guy?

25:03.526 --> 25:05.460
Look, Bill Clinton
loves McDonalds, right?

25:05.494 --> 25:07.061
Doesn't mean that the guy
putting pickles

25:07.096 --> 25:08.496
on his big Mac is his bff.

25:12.968 --> 25:15.837
The doctor said to me, "that's
not a rash, that's a lesion."

25:15.871 --> 25:18.106
and I'm just
penetrating very hard...

25:18.140 --> 25:20.708
Because I'm so up in the air...
Did you know Tamara's here?

25:20.743 --> 25:22.544
She blew the deal and

25:22.578 --> 25:24.279
showed up to the fucking party?

25:24.313 --> 25:26.448
Cat claw noise.
Hey,

25:26.482 --> 25:30.985
we all lost, Clyde, okay?

25:31.020 --> 25:32.821
Hey, if-if you
can find one

25:32.855 --> 25:35.824
who's not a total
dipshit a-hole, uh,

25:35.858 --> 25:38.326
I would be down
for a little something.

25:39.762 --> 25:41.029
Excuse me?

25:41.063 --> 25:42.664
A guy.

25:42.698 --> 25:44.299
What's the dj's story?

25:44.333 --> 25:46.034
Is he... you know what?
Fuck it.

25:46.068 --> 25:47.235
I'll take care of it myself.

25:47.269 --> 25:48.136
Uh...

25:48.170 --> 25:49.003
Wow.

25:50.072 --> 25:51.673
Someone needs to put
a roofie in her drink.

25:51.707 --> 25:53.675
Oh. What'd you just say?
I would never.

25:53.709 --> 25:54.676
I would never.

26:01.083 --> 26:05.019
Wow, this looks so... hard.

26:05.054 --> 26:06.321
So it's a little bitty...
Clyde, Clyde, Clyde...

26:06.355 --> 26:08.490
I'm so sorry.
Yes, what, Doug?

26:08.524 --> 26:10.358
Check out my hand--
the only thing between it

26:10.392 --> 26:12.494
and that vagina
is a sheer piece of silk.

26:12.528 --> 26:15.597
Uh, you win again, guggenheim.

26:15.631 --> 26:18.066
Well, let's hold it up.
All it took to make one friend

26:18.100 --> 26:21.870
was several bottles of $2,000
cristal, so good for you.

26:21.904 --> 26:23.671
- Wrong.
- Okay.

26:23.706 --> 26:25.673
How? Incorrect, Clyde. Look at the menu.

26:25.708 --> 26:27.342
Champagne is $20.

26:27.376 --> 26:29.344
Oh, I'm so sorry, my friend.

26:29.378 --> 26:30.812
It's not a decimal point.

26:30.846 --> 26:33.147
Pepper.

26:33.182 --> 26:34.983
$2,000.

26:39.522 --> 26:40.555
Uh, shit.
Marty, Marty, Marty!

26:40.589 --> 26:42.490
I only had, like, two glasses

26:42.525 --> 26:43.892
of that champagne, so when
we're splitting the bill...

26:43.926 --> 26:48.530
So, break out the white
sunglasses and the Dane cook cds

26:48.564 --> 26:49.697
because you and I are going out

26:49.732 --> 26:51.032
raging tomorrow night with--

26:51.066 --> 26:52.867
Wait for it--

26:52.902 --> 26:54.302
the douchebag twins!

26:54.336 --> 26:56.037
- Oh, fantastic!
- Oh, shit!

26:56.071 --> 26:58.573
God, not even two glasses.
If you look, I'm not...

26:58.607 --> 26:59.507
Oh, fuck it. Have some more

26:59.542 --> 27:00.508
because I got another

27:00.543 --> 27:01.809
little tasty nugget to give you.

27:01.844 --> 27:03.311
Well, let me heat it up.
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

27:03.345 --> 27:05.013
They are right now
in negotiations

27:05.047 --> 27:06.147
with Michael Carlson...

27:06.181 --> 27:07.181
Oh, my God.

27:07.216 --> 27:08.883
To open a club in...

27:08.918 --> 27:10.552
Oh...
Say the fucking vibrato.

27:10.586 --> 27:12.186
Wa for it.
No, say the fucking vibrato!

27:12.221 --> 27:13.721
- The fucking vibrato!
- Come on, baby!

27:13.756 --> 27:14.989
That's what I'm
talking about, Marty!

27:15.024 --> 27:16.524
Boom, baby!

27:16.559 --> 27:17.959
Give me that.

27:17.993 --> 27:19.627
Tamara, a second of your time.

27:19.662 --> 27:21.563
Has Marty always been the man?

27:21.597 --> 27:23.965
Oh, yeah, Marty's
always been the man.

27:23.999 --> 27:25.533
You're goddamn right.

27:25.568 --> 27:28.169
- Oh, this is big, daddy.
- Toast to me.

27:28.203 --> 27:31.806
I don't know.
I mean... it's overpriced, honestly.
