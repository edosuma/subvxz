WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.404
Hi, I'm Captain Dave,
and I'll be escorting

00:03.437 --> 00:06.740
you to an exclusive preview
of the pilot episode of "LA

00:06.774 --> 00:07.841
to Vegas."

00:07.875 --> 00:09.009
If there's anything
else you need--

00:09.043 --> 00:11.712
snack, blanket, perhaps
a cocktail-- well,

00:11.745 --> 00:13.181
you're on your own there.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.582
That's not my job.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.450
Enjoy the show.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.499
(women speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

00:31.532 --> 00:33.401
Hi, Mr. Brightman.

00:33.434 --> 00:34.768
It's Ronnie Messing.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.337
We met yesterday.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.339
I was just calling to...
Oh, wait!

00:38.372 --> 00:39.873
Sorry, not you.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.442
I'm yelling at a car.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.277
Anyway, I just want you to know

00:43.311 --> 00:45.879
I'm very, very interested
in the job.

00:45.913 --> 00:47.281
I still... Oh, wait!

00:47.315 --> 00:49.217
Again, not you.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.418
So call me.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.720
I'm talking to you this time,
not the car.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.388
(exasperated grunt)

00:54.422 --> 00:58.025
("Viva Las Vegas"
by Elvis Presley playing)

00:58.058 --> 00:59.793
-Hey, dick!
-Sorry.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.462
No liquids.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.896
* Gonna set my soul *

01:02.930 --> 01:04.865
-Ow.
-* On fire *

01:04.898 --> 01:06.867
-Ow. (panting)
-* Got a whole lot of money *

01:06.900 --> 01:08.869
* That's ready to burn *

01:08.902 --> 01:11.439
* So get those stakes
up higher *

01:11.472 --> 01:14.642
* There's a thousand pretty
women waitin' out there *

01:14.675 --> 01:16.744
* And they're all livin' *

01:16.777 --> 01:18.146
* Devil may care *

01:18.179 --> 01:19.580
* And I'm just the devil... *

01:19.613 --> 01:20.881
RONNIE:
Excuse me, guys.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.416
Sorry, I have
to get through here.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.784
I know. Thank you very much.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.219
-MAN: Hey!
-Oh, God. Sorry.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.620
Thank you. Excuse me. Oh.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.622
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Excuse me.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.558
* Viva Las Vegas *

01:30.591 --> 01:31.892
(grunts)

01:31.925 --> 01:33.894
* Viva *

01:33.927 --> 01:38.399
* Viva Las Vegas. *

01:38.432 --> 01:40.234
-(song ends)
-Welcome aboard.

01:40.268 --> 01:42.069
Got dressed in the terminal
again, didn't you?

01:42.102 --> 01:45.005
Well, at least I wore underwear
this time. Welcome!

01:45.038 --> 01:46.140
PILOT (over P.A.):
Jackpot Airlines.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.075
Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.078
*

01:51.111 --> 01:52.746
(slot machine chiming)

01:52.780 --> 01:55.015
(electronic chime)

01:55.048 --> 01:57.017
That's the third time
you've checked your phone.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.619
Am I not enough for you?

01:58.652 --> 02:00.821
I'm sorry.
I'm expecting a call.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.291
You heard about Margie Kendall
at Delta, right?

02:03.324 --> 02:04.992
Yeah, they fired her
after she freaked out

02:05.025 --> 02:07.127
and started sprinkling bacon
all over the vegan meals.

02:07.161 --> 02:09.129
Well, I applied for her job.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.299
-I interviewed for it yesterday.
-Girl, no.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.700
That's the JFK route.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.468
You don't want it.
It's so sad.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.870
The only reason people fly
to New York is for work,

02:16.904 --> 02:18.439
and, ugh, to see plays.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.040
Even the name JFK...

02:20.073 --> 02:22.142
(whispers):
so tragic.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.977
It's not just
about New York, Bernard.

02:24.011 --> 02:26.347
New York leads to London,
which leads to Hong Kong.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.882
I could see the world.
Isn't that why we do this?

02:28.916 --> 02:30.318
Let me tell you something.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.019
I've been doing this
for a long time.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.387
I've been on flights
with royalty.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.523
Hollywood royalty.
Elizabeth Taylor.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.125
-She threw an earring at a baby.
-Okay.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.693
And of all those destinations,

02:39.727 --> 02:41.962
Las Vegas is the most
enchanting place there is.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.797
A place where tigers
are liberated

02:43.831 --> 02:47.134
from their dirty jungles,
and acrobats can make a living.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.136
Do you really want
to leave this?

02:49.169 --> 02:52.072
I need to be on a real airline
where people aren't just looking

02:52.105 --> 02:54.342
to cheat on their wives
and butt-smuggle molly.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.477
Don't joke.
I lost a friend that way.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.178
MAN:
Ronnie!

02:58.212 --> 02:59.179
Ronnie?

02:59.213 --> 03:00.681
-Ronnie!
-Okay, okay.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.416
Artem, what's the problem?

03:02.450 --> 03:05.519
There's a baby man
sitting in my seat.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.888
We've been over this.
There aren't assigned seats.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.990
But you know
this is my lucky seat.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.493
If I sit here, I lose,
if I sit here, I lose,

03:12.526 --> 03:14.695
but if I sit here, I win.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.197
And I can hire
some sexy dancing ladies.

03:17.231 --> 03:20.067
This seat is a job creator.

03:20.100 --> 03:23.170
Then pay the extra seven dollars
for priority boarding.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.240
It's only a lucky seat
if it's free.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.775
We don't care where we sit.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.410
We'd just like two seats
next to each other.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.044
He's adorable.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.681
Okay. One moment.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.283
-ARTEM: Thank you.
-Um... Oh.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.351
Hi. I'm sorry,
would you mind terribly

03:37.385 --> 03:39.387
sitting next to
this pain in the ass

03:39.420 --> 03:41.088
and letting the couple
take your row?

03:41.121 --> 03:42.890
(British accent):
Oh, no. No, I'd rather not.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.926
I like to keep to myself,
and he's a bit of a talker.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.428
That's a nice shirt.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.129
How much percent cotton?

03:49.162 --> 03:50.698
(sighs):
Okay.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.533
Thank you. That's helpful.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.368
All right.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.604
Anybody sitting
next to an unoccupied seat

03:56.637 --> 03:59.039
and is willing to move
gets free beer!

03:59.072 --> 04:01.742
-(passengers shouting)
-You!

04:01.775 --> 04:03.711
Not you.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.879
-Anyone drinking for one?
-(passengers shouting)

04:05.913 --> 04:07.448
You, sir.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.450
(passengers groan)

04:09.483 --> 04:11.952
-Thank you.
-Of course. You're welcome.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.621
After you.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.292
You happy now,
or is he bad luck, too?

04:18.326 --> 04:19.560
Not sure yet.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.629
Are you Jew?

04:21.662 --> 04:25.599
Take it from me,
Muay Thai will change your life.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.568
-Mm-hmm. -I myself
started taking lessons,

04:27.601 --> 04:29.937
but I'm picking it up so fast
that I'm also giving lessons.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.573
Captain, cabin's ready
and doors are closed.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.476
All right, gentlemen,
it's time to get high.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.145
And also fly this old bird.
Just a little captain's joke.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.813
I never get high
when I'm flying,

04:39.847 --> 04:41.749
unless I mistimed the edible.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.584
-Another captain's joke.
-(chuckles)

04:43.617 --> 04:46.620
You really think that's
a good use of everyone's time?

04:46.654 --> 04:49.256
If I can't have some fun with
my passengers, why am I here?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.258
To fly the plane.
Go do that.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.760
Ronnie, I haven't taken orders

04:52.793 --> 04:54.762
since I was in the Air Force
or married.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.665
Fortunately, I was
honorably discharged from both.

04:57.698 --> 05:01.502
He still looks at pictures
of his ex-wife and cries.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.872
You want to do the honors, Alan?

05:04.905 --> 05:06.874
-Yeah!
-No. You never touch this.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.776
This is Captain Dave time.

05:08.809 --> 05:12.446
Good afternoon, everyone.
This is your captain and friend.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.216
I'd like to welcome you
on Jackpot Airlines Flight 1610,

05:16.249 --> 05:18.919
service to "Lost Wages."
(chuckles)

05:20.921 --> 05:22.523
Why aren't you laughing?

05:22.556 --> 05:24.592
I've heard it, like,
1,200 times.

05:27.227 --> 05:30.698
Okay, I saw you talking
to the British invasion before.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.666
Shut up right now
and tell us everything.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.334
Oh, it was magical.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.570
I ask him to move, he said no.

05:36.604 --> 05:39.306
But that accent. Does he
call his pants "trousers"?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.742
Ooh, I bet he likes warm beer.
Do we have any?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.744
The fridge is broken;
that's all we have.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.979
Maybe he's a secret agent
like James Bond,

05:46.013 --> 05:47.515
who keeps falling in love

05:47.548 --> 05:49.517
with the witnesses
he's sworn to protect.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.084
But, oh,
they keep getting killed.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.853
Well, he's terrible
at his job, then.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.423
Explains why
he flies this airline.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.757
You know what?

05:56.790 --> 05:59.159
I'm just gonna find out
British guy's deal myself.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.695
I might as well, right?
Today is my last chance.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.864
-Why? What's going on?
-Oh, I didn't tell you?

06:03.897 --> 06:05.899
Delta hired me
for their JFK route.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.736
You got Margie Kendall's job.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.438
(chuckles awkwardly):
Oh...

06:10.471 --> 06:12.406
Wow!

06:12.440 --> 06:14.775
That's so... great!

06:14.808 --> 06:18.045
I mean, what a big...
big deal for you.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.413
(chuckles)

06:19.447 --> 06:20.648
(screaming)

06:22.082 --> 06:23.717
DAVE:
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:23.751 --> 06:25.786
if you're looking
for a high-quality steak

06:25.819 --> 06:27.621
at a low-quality price,

06:27.655 --> 06:29.423
go to Ernie's Steakhouse
off the Strip.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.892
Trust me,
I don't get paid to say this.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.393
Free steak.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.163
-Bye.
-Bye.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.134
Oh, my God, are you a stripper?

06:41.168 --> 06:43.036
Um... no.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.205
Why not?
You have an amazing body.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.940
You could totally be a stripper.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.643
I'm a stripper.
Kelly's a stripper.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.312
We go to Vegas on the weekends
because you can make, like,

06:52.345 --> 06:54.582
ten times more there
than you would in L.A.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.383
Especially if there's
a big fight in town

06:56.416 --> 06:58.586
or a trade show for phones
or toilets or whatever.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.555
I mean, you would not believe
how lonely urinal salesmen are.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.991
That all sounds... neat.

07:04.024 --> 07:07.628
Um, but actually, I'm going
to Vegas to get married.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.396
Oh, that's so romantic.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.899
-Marriage is the best.
-Are you married?

07:11.932 --> 07:14.434
No. But a lot of the guys
who ask me for oral are.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.904
Anyway, if you ever want
to come by the club and dance,

07:16.937 --> 07:18.405
ask for Nichole.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.307
I get a bonus
for every new girl I bring in.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.843
And don't worry, I'm not
gonna make you trap or anything.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.112
-Trap?
-Tell you that we're gonna go

07:25.145 --> 07:27.648
and strip and party, but then
force you into prostitution.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.751
Oh. Well, I wasn't
worried about that,

07:30.784 --> 07:33.921
but now it's the only thing
I'll ever worry about.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.122
(both laugh)

07:37.290 --> 07:40.661
I trained Jill. How could they
give her that job over me?

07:40.694 --> 07:42.095
So you didn't get JFK.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.631
Personally,
I think you dodged a bullet.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.166
Unlike a certain president
on a cold November day.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.968
I did not take this job
to be stuck

07:48.001 --> 07:49.703
on the same
stupid route forever.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.705
I thought I was going
to travel the world,

07:51.739 --> 07:53.006
meet interesting people.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.441
I thought I would have
adventures.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.276
I thought I was
gonna be a dancer.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.879
Oh, my God.
Is that how crazy I sound?

07:58.912 --> 08:00.347
Ronnie, this is
where you belong.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.849
You are great at this job.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.450
You speak
these people's language.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.218
I don't want to speak
their language.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.387
I want to speak French
or Italian

08:07.420 --> 08:09.690
or whatever accent
Madonna's faking right now.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.324
You leave Madonna out of this.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.326
I can't do this anymore,
Bernard.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.728
I've had enough.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.229
I quit.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.532
-No, you don't.
-Yes, I do. I'm done.

08:18.566 --> 08:21.334
And the raving bitch in 5E
needs a double screwdriver.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.871
-There's no one in 5E.
-There is now.

08:25.939 --> 08:29.342
And don't worry, I'm not gonna
make you trap or anything.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.944
(Ronnie sighs)

08:33.013 --> 08:34.648
MAN: Hey, we don't even
need a chapel.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.984
This guy will come to our
hotel room and marry us for free

08:37.017 --> 08:40.487
-if we let him film the...
Never mind. -Hello.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.724
I would like to apologize
for my earlier rudeness.

08:43.757 --> 08:47.060
I didn't even say
congratulations for wedding.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.228
(chuckles)

08:48.261 --> 08:50.263
Oh. Thank you.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.899
So, give me the deets.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.100
(Katie chuckles)

08:53.133 --> 08:55.002
You are eloping?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.237
Well, we actually
aren't calling it that,

08:57.270 --> 09:01.008
but, yeah, I-I guess
that is what we're doing.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.776
Marriage is such
a beautiful institution.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.444
I'm married.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.748
The first time I see wife,
it was like Cupid hit me.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.617
Yeah. Yeah, that's how we felt.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.251
-Yeah.
-We're high school sweethearts.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.054
So why you elope?
He knock you up?

09:14.087 --> 09:15.689
No. God, no, she's not pregnant.

09:15.723 --> 09:16.890
-I...
-(chuckles)

09:16.924 --> 09:19.126
Oh, because you're virgins?

09:19.159 --> 09:22.295
It's religious, and now
you want to get married quickly

09:22.329 --> 09:23.731
so he can make entry.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.432
I'm sorry. So he can what?

09:25.465 --> 09:27.701
Uh, we're-we're not religious.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.236
It's just...

09:29.269 --> 09:30.938
Our parents are throwing
this giant wedding for us

09:30.971 --> 09:32.706
-that we don't want.
-(sighs)

09:32.740 --> 09:35.542
We finally decided to just
do this on our own terms.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.477
Well, I wish the both of you

09:37.510 --> 09:41.649
a lifetime full of
happiness, luck and love.

09:41.682 --> 09:42.816
-Thank you.
-ARTEM: Yup.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.217
(laughs)

09:44.251 --> 09:46.119
What a sweet man.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.456
It is to piss off the parents.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.793
(electronic chime)

09:55.829 --> 09:57.965
(gags softly)

09:57.998 --> 10:01.635
Hey, King George, you want
to have a drink with me?

10:01.669 --> 10:04.337
Seems like you're doing fine
by yourself.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.139
Vodka, scotch, tequila.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.608
It's like you're hosting
the Olympics in your liver.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.811
Oh, yeah.
Well, Russia's in the lead,

10:10.844 --> 10:13.747
but Mexico's coming on strong.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.348
Mmm.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.150
Oh, come on.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.352
One drink.
I'm having a bad day.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.154
-Fine, I'll have one.
-Hmm.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.990
But only 'cause
I'm concerned about

10:23.023 --> 10:25.325
what all this liquor is doing
to somebody of your body mass.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.160
Oh, you've noticed my body mass.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.997
Yes, well, you have to have
a keen eye

10:30.030 --> 10:31.832
when you're an MI6 agent.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.034
Even a terrible one

10:34.067 --> 10:36.136
who kills all his witnesses.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.806
(laughs)
No, you don't kill them.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.641
You're just so incompetent,
they die on your watch.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.476
-Oh, right.
-Yeah.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.779
I need to do a better job
of eavesdropping next time.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.380
Mistakes like that
get people killed.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.516
-Yeah.
-(laughs)

10:49.549 --> 10:51.151
You know,
in eight months of flying,

10:51.184 --> 10:53.386
I think this is the most
I've ever heard you talk.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.322
Well, I guess it's 'cause
you haven't got me drunk before.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.224
-You want another one?
-No. No, no, no.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.827
One more, and I'm gonna have
to attend a tiny A.A. meeting.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.294
(laughs)

11:01.328 --> 11:02.696
Okay, so what do you really do?

11:02.730 --> 11:05.733
I am a professor of economics
at, uh, UCLA.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.335
Oh, well, are you at least,
like, a rogue professor

11:08.368 --> 11:10.003
who plays by his own rules?

11:10.037 --> 11:13.406
No. I generally operate
within university bylaws.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.642
Wait, did you say
you teach economics?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.711
Okay, you might know this.
So, I'm an exotic dancer,

11:17.745 --> 11:20.380
and I get naked at work,
but I also get naked in my home.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.149
Can I write that off
as a home office?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.516
I don't believe so.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.019
(quietly):
I'm gonna kill Amber.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.191
Nice to see you.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.659
Well, look at that.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.327
You two kids
getting married this weekend?

11:34.361 --> 11:35.428
Uh-huh.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.897
That's fantastic.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.899
You know,
if you need an officiant...

11:38.932 --> 11:41.001
Oh, actually, we might.
Are you ordained?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.703
Uh, yeah.
You're sitting in my ordination.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.273
You know how a boat captain
can marry anyone?

11:46.306 --> 11:48.341
I'm a plane captain.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.877
-(Katie chuckles)
-It's the same thing.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.845
It's not the same thing.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.346
Yes, it is.
What the hell do you know?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.015
I know that you should be
flying this plane

11:55.048 --> 11:56.583
and not talking garbage.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.351
If you understood anything
about modern aviation,

11:58.385 --> 12:00.053
you know these planes
fly themselves.

12:00.087 --> 12:03.123
This baby is
a technological marvel.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.592
And besides, my job isn't
just about flying the plane.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.460
It's about connecting
with the passengers.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.030
Connect with us
by not crashing the plane!

12:10.063 --> 12:12.199
I'll connect
however the hell I want!

12:12.232 --> 12:15.535
Hey, you still owe me $300
from, uh, Vikings last week.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.570
I'm good for it.

12:19.106 --> 12:22.075
I really thought
that Delta job was my chance.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.744
I-I don't understand
why this keeps happening to me.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.780
Uh-huh.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.049
"Uh-huh," what?

12:29.082 --> 12:31.251
Oh, it's nothing.
I was just clearing my throat.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.620
The accent makes it sound,
um, judgmental.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.789
No, it's fine. You can tell me.
I'm a big girl.

12:38.491 --> 12:42.262
Well, I've observed
that you are quite impulsive.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.264
You did just quit your job
on this airline

12:44.297 --> 12:46.299
because you didn't get a job
on another airline,

12:46.333 --> 12:48.401
which is precisely
when you would need a job

12:48.435 --> 12:50.270
on this airline.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.941
Thank you very much, but I don't
need to get lectured by you.

12:53.974 --> 12:57.110
People literally pay
to get lectured by me.

12:57.144 --> 13:00.480
Okay, TED Talk,
what would you have done?

13:00.513 --> 13:02.582
Well, since you asked,
I would have analyzed

13:02.615 --> 13:04.584
current hiring trends
in the job market,

13:04.617 --> 13:06.753
cross-referenced those with
my experience and particular...

13:06.786 --> 13:08.521
-Oh, my God!
-If nothing else,

13:08.555 --> 13:10.523
I wouldn't have quit
on the outbound flight,

13:10.557 --> 13:13.160
'cause now you're gonna have
to pay for your own way home.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.998
Damn it. Yes.

13:18.031 --> 13:21.268
That was dumb on my part,
but I go with my gut,

13:21.301 --> 13:24.371
unlike some overthinky
British know-it-all

13:24.404 --> 13:26.039
with an NPR tote bag.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.507
Okay, their programming
is brought to us

13:27.540 --> 13:28.608
by listeners like me.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.177
Well, I don't
have to listen to you

13:30.210 --> 13:32.345
just because you have
a sexy accent.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.047
Well, I don't
have to engage with you

13:34.081 --> 13:35.883
just because you're
uncommonly beautiful.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.450
Why are you complimenting me?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.119
You complimented me first.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.787
This is a very confusing fight!

13:40.820 --> 13:42.555
You're a very confusing woman!

13:42.589 --> 13:44.892
Well, I know how to make it
more confusing!

13:50.697 --> 13:53.233
(groans) That's wet,
that's wet, that's wet.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.802
This is so much grosser than
I ever imagined it would be.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.371
Never touch that with your hand!

14:00.607 --> 14:02.642
(knock on door)

14:02.675 --> 14:04.577
You two banging in there?

14:04.611 --> 14:06.914
Rain check?

14:06.947 --> 14:08.848
-God, yes.
-Yeah, okay, okay.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.151
DAVE: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Las Vegas.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.986
(passengers cheering)

14:13.020 --> 14:15.222
Okay, so it looks like the
chapel is next to a gun range.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.856
-Ooh. -Wait, the chapel
is a gun range.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.758
Hey, look, I've never done
anything like that before.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.260
I don't want you
to think that...

14:20.293 --> 14:21.261
Oh, I don't.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.595
Also, by the way,
neither have I.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.397
-So I don't want you to think...
-I don't.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.733
Good. So, neither of us think.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.601
PASSENGERS (chanting):
Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!

14:28.635 --> 14:29.769
(chanting continues)

14:29.802 --> 14:31.404
I'll call you
when I'm back in L.A.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.705
I'd like that.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.341
Vegas! Vegas!

14:34.374 --> 14:36.143

14:38.311 --> 14:39.579
(electronic chime)

14:39.612 --> 14:40.780
(man clears throat)

14:40.813 --> 14:42.382
Well, bad news, folks.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.617
Flight 1322
with service to Los Angeles

14:44.651 --> 14:47.454
will be delayed
at least another hour.

14:47.487 --> 14:50.890
I just want to throw up
in my own house.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.525
(slot machine music playing)

14:52.559 --> 14:53.726
(slot machine chiming)

14:53.760 --> 14:55.862
Hey. How'd you do this weekend?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.764
Ah, so-so.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.799
(chuckles)
What about you?

14:59.832 --> 15:02.635
Pretty good.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.605
Maybe I should quit card,
become stripper, huh?

15:05.638 --> 15:07.540
Well, what are you working with?
'Cause you'll clean up

15:07.574 --> 15:09.809
if you're bigger than eight
or smaller than three.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.278
And then she says,

15:11.311 --> 15:13.780
"I can't be with someone
who's always somewhere else."

15:13.813 --> 15:15.915
So I say, "Booboo, I'm a pilot."

15:15.949 --> 15:19.252
And she says, "No,
emotionally somewhere else."

15:19.286 --> 15:21.421
Then... I don't know
what she said.

15:21.454 --> 15:24.657
I had to end the FaceTime
because we were landing.

15:24.691 --> 15:25.892
Mmm.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.794
One more for the road, Scotty.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.762
I'm wheels up in ten.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.331
(sighs)

15:35.368 --> 15:37.304
It's club soda.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.538
(chuckles)

15:40.707 --> 15:42.809
MAN (over P.A.):
Flight 1322, now boarding.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.145
Hey, there.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.746
Hi.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.848
Uh, what are you doing here?
I thought you quit.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.417
Oh, well, you were right.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.685
That might've been
a little too impulsive.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.687
And besides, this job
is not all that bad.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.956
I meet some interesting people
at least, right?

15:56.990 --> 15:58.858
Uh, yeah, that's good.
Uh, pleased for you.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.428
Here's the thing,
uh, quick update...

16:01.461 --> 16:03.296
Honey, all the bins are full.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.697
I hate other people's stuff.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.499
Hi. Can you check this for us?

16:06.533 --> 16:09.836
"Us"?

16:09.869 --> 16:11.304
You two are together?

16:11.338 --> 16:13.206
Yeah. We're married.
Isn't he lucky?

16:13.240 --> 16:14.707
Can you take it, please?

16:14.741 --> 16:16.376
Yes.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.777
Absolutely.

16:17.810 --> 16:21.214
I didn't realize
you had so much baggage.

16:21.248 --> 16:24.017
(Colin groaning quietly)

16:26.586 --> 16:28.288
WOMAN: For the new trick,
Pascal the Magnificent

16:28.321 --> 16:30.557
wants to make me disappear

16:30.590 --> 16:34.527
and then reappear in Jerusalem.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.529
But I don't know.
I don't like hummus.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.799
-(seat belt indicator chimes)
-Excuse me.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.301
Oh, no, it's guacamole
I don't like.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.735
I don't like guacamole.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.337
RONNIE (over P.A.):
Attention, passengers,

16:44.371 --> 16:47.174
you are now free
to move about the cabin.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.242
Hello.
Could I please explain?

16:49.276 --> 16:50.843
No need. I get it.
Mystery solved.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.712
You go to Vegas every weekend
to see your wife.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.547
No. I go to see my child.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.149
Of course you have a family.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.585
You didn't think about maybe
mentioning that to me before?

16:58.618 --> 17:00.387
Oh, yeah, while you were
unbuttoning my pants,

17:00.420 --> 17:03.423
I kept on thinking, "I can't
wait for her to meet my son."

17:03.456 --> 17:05.558
-Look... -I can't believe
how stupid I feel.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.527
I was just having
such a bad day,

17:07.560 --> 17:10.330
and I really thought
something nice came out of this.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.065
But you're not nice.
You're just another guy

17:12.099 --> 17:14.167
who will do anything
to get a woman into bathroom.

17:14.201 --> 17:17.504
Just listen. A few years ago,
I was in Vegas for a conference.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.107
I met... a magician's assistant.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.509
I didn't overthink it for once.
We spent the night together.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.910
Ta-da! She's pregnant.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.445
I mean, what are the odds?

17:25.478 --> 17:27.447
Well, it depends on her age,

17:27.480 --> 17:30.283
time in cycle, and which pocket
you keep your cell phone.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.085
It's roughly five to two.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.386
That's not helpful.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.921
Sit down, Colin. We're done.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.289
-Can we please just discuss...
-(electronic chime)

17:36.323 --> 17:37.757
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:37.790 --> 17:40.093
the captain has turned on
the fasten seat belt sign.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.461
Please return to your seats.

17:41.494 --> 17:42.962
The seat belt light isn't on.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.197
(seat belt indicator chimes)

17:44.231 --> 17:45.432
Right, but we're not
experiencing any...

17:45.465 --> 17:46.933
Wow.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.269
That is a terrifying trick.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.942
And the thing that took
my Muay Thai to the next level

17:55.975 --> 17:57.710
was when I realized...

17:57.744 --> 17:59.346
(whispers):
there are no levels.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.882
You want to fly the plane?

18:02.915 --> 18:04.317
Okay.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.054
What are you doing?

18:08.087 --> 18:09.256
Just taking a walk.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.990
Mm-hmm.
And what's in your pocket?

18:11.023 --> 18:13.560
Is that... Oh. A sock?

18:13.593 --> 18:15.762
Were you gonna put a sock
on the cockpit door?

18:15.795 --> 18:17.264
Yeah. I'm doing it
for all of you.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.798
It's bad enough
Alan has to watch.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.400
This is not okay.
You cannot just go around

18:20.433 --> 18:21.768
putting socks wherever you want.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.436
Captain Steve,
who flies international,

18:23.470 --> 18:25.605
says he has sex all the time
with the passengers.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.574
How come I'm not allowed
to do anything cool?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.842
How come I can't bond
with some 21-year-old bros

18:29.876 --> 18:32.312
or officiate a wedding
or make it with some EDM ho?

18:32.345 --> 18:34.581
Excuse me. I'm into house.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.250
And I cannot wait
to hear all about that.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.118
You think this is
how I pictured my life?

18:39.152 --> 18:41.020
I grew up wanting to be
a fighter pilot,

18:41.053 --> 18:42.255
not flying
the puddle jumper to Vegas.

18:42.289 --> 18:45.292
All I wanted to be was a hero.

18:45.325 --> 18:48.528
Now I'll just settle
for one decent story.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.297
Please...

18:50.330 --> 18:52.499
don't cockpit block me.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.701
(sighs)

18:54.734 --> 18:56.035
(chuckles)

18:58.037 --> 19:00.039
Ronnie, can I at least
have my sock back?

19:00.072 --> 19:02.975
My foot's freezing.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.181
Hey, newlywed.

19:08.215 --> 19:10.483
Where's the wifey?
I just wanted to say thanks.

19:10.517 --> 19:11.884
'Cause of her,
I got a gift card.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.786
What are you talking about?

19:13.820 --> 19:16.189
Well, she came to my club and
danced and said I referred her.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.957
To dance, you mean to strip?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.692
Well, yeah. You didn't see?

19:19.726 --> 19:22.729
No. Last time I saw Katie
was Friday night.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.798
So the wedding did not happen?

19:25.832 --> 19:27.700
No. Okay?

19:27.734 --> 19:29.502
When we got to the hotel,

19:29.536 --> 19:31.838
she decided that I've been
holding her back.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.341
So, she broke it off
and stayed in Vegas.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.676
That's the story.
You happy now?

19:36.709 --> 19:40.347
No, I lost "Girl stays in Vegas"
six to one.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.582
You're a winner, Gary!

19:42.615 --> 19:45.151
Wait, you bet on
my marriage falling apart?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.919
Eh...

19:46.953 --> 19:49.222
What is wrong with you people?!

19:49.256 --> 19:52.425
Before she got on this plane,
she was just a normal girl.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.927
Two hours with all of you,
and suddenly she's leaving me

19:54.961 --> 19:57.163
to go take her clothes off
for a Saudi prince.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.666
Oh, you guys met Raja.
No, he's not a Saudi prince.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.768
He's just a Mexican
with a pet falcon.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.236
What's going on?

20:03.270 --> 20:05.872
This plane is full of monsters.

20:05.905 --> 20:09.242
Okay. You're not wrong, but the
best thing you can do right now

20:09.276 --> 20:12.011
is just take a deep breath
and relax.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.913
Oh, now you want
to get involved?

20:13.946 --> 20:16.616
You're not too busy having sex
in the bathroom with that guy?

20:19.286 --> 20:20.753
Yeah, everybody knows
about that.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.255
Wait, you had sex with her?

20:22.289 --> 20:24.190
No, we did not have sex.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.192
It was just a bit of
over-the-trouser stuff.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.060
Trousers. Told you.

20:28.094 --> 20:31.063
But, frankly, even if we did,
it's none of your business.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.866
-We've been separated a year.
-You're separated?

20:33.900 --> 20:36.068
Yes. That's what I was trying
to tell you before...

20:36.102 --> 20:37.637
Oh, my God! Who cares?!

20:37.670 --> 20:40.773
Okay, just calm down.
Let me get you a nice warm beer.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.443
Do not come near me,
or I swear I will go

20:43.476 --> 20:45.778
Passenger 57
all over this place.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.614
You leave Wesley Snipes
out of this.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.115
You people are the villains,

20:49.148 --> 20:51.384
and you know what happens
to the villains?

20:51.418 --> 20:53.753
They go down.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.888
-(passengers murmuring)
-Yeah, that's right.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.424
I'll take out this whole plane.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.125
They'll call me a hero.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.461
They will throw parades
in my honor!

21:01.494 --> 21:03.262
-Muay Thai!
-(passengers gasping)

21:03.296 --> 21:05.765
(Ryan grunting)

21:05.798 --> 21:06.966
Ooh.

21:09.168 --> 21:10.136
Okay.

21:10.169 --> 21:11.671
Too far. I get it.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.939
That was too far.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.107
Consider yourself grounded.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.143
(passengers cheering)

21:20.347 --> 21:22.582
This is a pretty good story.

21:22.615 --> 21:26.819
Making love in the cockpit
would've been a better one.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.822
(plane passes overhead)

21:29.856 --> 21:31.658
Oh, good luck, my friend.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.361
We're all betting
you're out on good behavior,

21:34.394 --> 21:37.397
so be nice, but don't be bitch!

21:38.831 --> 21:40.333
May I?

21:40.367 --> 21:41.834
Where's your wife?

21:41.868 --> 21:44.337
Ah, I got her a ticket
back to Vegas.

21:44.371 --> 21:47.106
She wanted to come to L.A.
to work things out.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.609
My instinct was to say no,
but, um...

21:49.642 --> 21:51.110
You overthought it?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.979
-Yes, I did.
-Mm.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.447
(Ronnie chuckles)

21:54.481 --> 21:57.016
So, where do you suppose
this leaves me and you?

21:57.049 --> 21:59.386
I don't know.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.520
Okay.

22:00.553 --> 22:03.523
I'll have to think about it.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.725
And I would say
don't overthink it...

22:05.758 --> 22:06.859
(Ronnie chuckles)

22:06.893 --> 22:08.528
...'cause I kind of like
your impulsiveness.

22:08.561 --> 22:11.163
I kind of like
your NPR tote bag.

22:11.197 --> 22:12.965
Aw, that's so sad.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.167
I really thought they were gonna
end up in another bathroom.

22:15.201 --> 22:16.302
What the hell?

22:16.335 --> 22:17.870
Yeah, I've got a black light

22:17.904 --> 22:20.373
and a little dance floor
in my apartment. (chuckles)

22:20.407 --> 22:21.541
Bye, guys.

22:21.574 --> 22:22.875
Is that my sock?

22:22.909 --> 22:25.478
Alan!

22:25.512 --> 22:27.647
Give me back my sock!

22:27.680 --> 22:29.682
Alan!

22:34.754 --> 22:36.723
