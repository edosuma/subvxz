01:02.336 --> 01:04.672
No!

01:04.754 --> 01:06.382
- No!
- Let me help!

01:06.465 --> 01:09.760
No. Don't touch my cards.

01:12.221 --> 01:17.143
- How much do I owe you?
- Owe me? Owe me?

01:18.269 --> 01:24.191
The service is free...
free to all new employees...

01:26.152 --> 01:28.696
This was no true reading, Vena.

01:28.779 --> 01:33.618
You must come back again when
the cards have calmed themselves.

01:33.701 --> 01:35.786
You're hurting me...

01:42.043 --> 01:49.008
In the business for 20 odd years...
20 odd years... and I can tell you...

01:49.091 --> 01:50.760
It's a gold mine.

01:50.843 --> 01:53.971
Yes, ma'am, that's what I said.
A gold mine!...

01:54.055 --> 01:56.682
Couldn't be a better investment
on earth.

01:56.766 --> 01:59.226
- Did you hear that, Frank?
- You newcomers will love it.

01:59.310 --> 02:04.273
We're charmed here. Charmed,
and a charming bunch of people.

02:04.357 --> 02:06.233
So far they seem a little odd.

02:06.317 --> 02:08.360
Have you met the Davises?
They're new here too.

02:08.443 --> 02:10.488
Cute little boy they have, eh?

02:10.571 --> 02:14.700
Oh, you haven't met 'em yet...
Friendliest bunch of people on earth.

02:14.784 --> 02:16.577
Ah. Mr Bean.

02:17.620 --> 02:22.249
This is Mr Bean,
the oldest member of the Carnival.

02:22.333 --> 02:24.085
How do you do, Mr Bean?

02:24.168 --> 02:27.296
Pleased to meet you, Mr Bean.

02:29.757 --> 02:33.761
Accidents happen around a carnival.
That's an old war wound of the business.

02:33.844 --> 02:36.222
- Isn't that right Mr Bean?
- Quiet.

02:36.305 --> 02:38.849
Oh, yes, sir.
Mr Bean is quiet enough.

02:38.933 --> 02:42.019
Yes, sir. There's only one thing
Mr Bean likes more than quiet

02:42.103 --> 02:45.398
and that's money.
That's why he's in the business.

02:45.481 --> 02:48.567
When do we get to see this Malatesta?

02:48.651 --> 02:50.903
I do all the signing for him.

02:50.986 --> 02:53.447
I'm the business manager
of this carnival.

02:56.158 --> 02:58.744
Where have you been?

02:58.828 --> 03:02.498
There are prizes
to be unloaded and shelved.

03:02.581 --> 03:04.083
I was having my fortune told.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.460
Lot of nonsense, that.
That's for old ladies.

03:06.544 --> 03:09.630
They line up. You should see them
on a Sunday afternoon.

03:09.714 --> 03:12.425
Hundreds of them.
Straight from church.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.428
I didn't have to pay anything.

03:15.511 --> 03:19.849
Johnny called. He's driving down...
Says he'll get here tonight.

03:19.932 --> 03:22.101
Ah, the ubiquitous Mr Bean.

03:59.430 --> 04:01.056
Got you.

04:01.932 --> 04:04.727
No one will come
within 500 yards of this place...

04:04.810 --> 04:06.604
...except me.

04:06.687 --> 04:10.608
Some kids were killed here. At least
that's the story we're all weaned on.

04:14.278 --> 04:16.447
Another duck bites the dust.

04:16.529 --> 04:19.158
What do you want?

04:19.241 --> 04:24.205
What everybody wants:
money, affection...

04:26.373 --> 04:29.919
But what I want
is different from what I got.

04:30.002 --> 04:33.923
Totally dead. A total wreck.

04:34.006 --> 04:37.426
But I think I've finally got it
in working shape.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.887
You want to come over and try it out?

04:41.555 --> 04:43.724
You work for Mr Blood?

04:43.808 --> 04:48.813
My name is Kit.
I run the Tunnel of Love.

04:48.896 --> 04:53.400
I flunked out of school
and providing I work like hell,

04:53.484 --> 04:56.028
Mr Blood has given me
the dubious distinction

04:56.111 --> 05:00.449
of running that questionable wreck
they call the Tunnel of Love.

05:04.995 --> 05:07.039
- What's your name?
- Why?

05:08.207 --> 05:10.209
I thought it was part of the game?

05:12.211 --> 05:15.422
Vena... Vena Norris.

05:15.506 --> 05:17.758
My parents let me stay at home.

05:17.842 --> 05:20.302
I guess, they're afraid
of having me stay out here.

05:21.804 --> 05:23.556
You've got some visitors.

05:23.639 --> 05:27.226
- Hey lady. Let me shoot, huh?
- No, Toby.

05:27.309 --> 05:30.229
You must be Vena. I'm Adele Davis.

05:30.312 --> 05:32.731
We met your parents earlier.

05:32.815 --> 05:35.192
I want that snake.

05:35.276 --> 05:36.861
I see you've met Toby.

05:36.944 --> 05:39.530
It's a trial... having an intelligent child.

05:39.613 --> 05:42.867
No. I want that dead chicken.
That's what I want.

05:42.950 --> 05:44.285
Quiet!

05:44.368 --> 05:46.954
I don't suppose Toby
could have a few shots?

05:47.037 --> 05:49.832
Well, I haven't yet loaded the guns,
Mrs Davies.

05:49.915 --> 05:53.752
I want a chicken.
I want a chicken.

05:53.836 --> 05:55.880
Stop it, I'm telling you!

05:57.131 --> 05:59.508
I'm sorry, Toby.

05:59.592 --> 06:03.721
Look, Toby.
Look what the nice lady has for you.

06:07.182 --> 06:09.685
Well, they cost a dollar twenty-five.

06:09.768 --> 06:11.395
Well...

06:12.313 --> 06:15.107
It's so much work
getting ready for opening day.

06:15.190 --> 06:17.693
Toby's a little cranky.

06:17.776 --> 06:19.653
We have the Ferris Wheel.

06:19.737 --> 06:23.407
Mr Blood says
that's the real money-maker.

06:23.490 --> 06:26.285
Toby and I are going over
to the Tunnel of Love. I'll meet you there.

06:26.368 --> 06:29.204
How nice.
Did you hear that Henry?

08:09.096 --> 08:11.015
Are you in there?

09:15.954 --> 09:17.998
Vena, have you started dinner yet?

09:18.082 --> 09:20.459
- Yes, Mom.
- Vena?

09:20.542 --> 09:23.087
Yes, Mother. I've started dinner!

09:23.170 --> 09:25.214
Why don't you stay for dinner,
Mr Blood?

09:25.297 --> 09:29.885
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you very much
for your generous hospitality.

09:29.968 --> 09:34.223
But I prefer to take my meals at home...
Doctor's orders. I...

09:34.306 --> 09:37.434
- How about a beer then?
- Thanks again, but no thanks.

09:37.518 --> 09:39.645
I'm on a very strict diet.

09:39.728 --> 09:41.480
Oh, I don't believe it.

09:41.563 --> 09:43.899
You look pretty healthy to me, Mr Blood.

09:45.818 --> 09:51.490
Discipline, Mrs Norris.
My metabolism is most unusual.

09:51.573 --> 09:56.453
Five years ago, the doctor
gave me six months. Strict regimen.

09:57.746 --> 10:02.668
I feel every moment
as a triumph over death.

10:05.003 --> 10:07.506
- Who's in there?
- My parents...

10:07.589 --> 10:09.091
Shh!

10:12.636 --> 10:15.472
I can't talk now.
Can I meet you, later?

10:16.807 --> 10:19.351
OK. The Ghoul's Eye.

10:19.434 --> 10:22.521
Listen. Something bad's happened.
Something to the Davises...

10:22.604 --> 10:25.399
Look here! What did I tell you?

10:25.482 --> 10:28.402
Carnival's a great place
for young people.

10:28.485 --> 10:31.613
Your daughter's made friends already.

10:31.697 --> 10:34.449
Hello Kit. Through for the day?

10:37.244 --> 10:39.246
Kit's a shy one, isn't he?

10:40.622 --> 10:44.376
See you tomorrow, Norris.
We'll get you settled in.

10:48.672 --> 10:53.385
Lucky's here, Frank. I know it.
And something awful's happened to him.

10:53.468 --> 10:55.888
If he's here, we'll find him.

10:55.971 --> 10:57.973
I don't like that Mr Blood.

10:58.849 --> 11:01.435
We should leave, Frank.
We should get out of here tonight.

11:01.518 --> 11:05.189
This place, it's... evil. I can feel it.

11:06.148 --> 11:10.611
If something's happened to him,
then I'll have my revenge

11:11.862 --> 11:15.365
We've got to stick together.
That's what they want.

13:19.364 --> 13:21.658
Holy crap!

13:40.427 --> 13:42.721
Shit, man. This place is dead.

13:48.310 --> 13:51.521
Hey, now. Lookie there,
lookie there. Come on.

13:51.605 --> 13:54.066
Come on, come on.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.202
Hey, mister. Are you open?

14:05.285 --> 14:09.289
All right. Come on, wimp.
Hey, don't be a chicken.

14:14.336 --> 14:16.004
You all right, or not?

14:16.088 --> 14:19.007
You've got to be kidding, Win.

14:19.091 --> 14:21.468
Half of this place is shut down.
We haven't done anything.

14:21.551 --> 14:23.553
Yeah, I want to spend these.

14:23.637 --> 14:26.014
It's all the same to me, young fellow.

14:26.098 --> 14:28.100
All right, just keep moving.

14:28.183 --> 14:30.268
Lucky Norris wants a ride
on a rollercoaster.

15:43.383 --> 15:46.678
Hey, mister. Help!
Somebody's been hurt over there.

15:46.761 --> 15:49.139
Oh, dear.
May I trouble you for a match?

15:49.222 --> 15:51.683
What? But you don't understand!

15:51.766 --> 15:54.311
My buddy, he goes into
the roller-coaster over there

15:54.394 --> 15:56.938
and the next thing you know,
there's all kinds of screaming.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.357
He comes
out and he don't have no head!

15:59.441 --> 16:03.570
- What am I going to do?
- That gentleman will assist you.

16:08.700 --> 16:12.162
Hey! You've got to help me.

16:12.245 --> 16:14.956
You... No, don't do that!

Sleep?! Ha!

19:35.949 --> 19:37.701
Is Vena in bed?

19:39.828 --> 19:41.996
I don't trust that boy, that Kit.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.082
What was he doing
at the window before?

19:44.165 --> 19:46.626
That's what I'd like to know.

19:46.710 --> 19:50.880
This is crazy.
Why don't we get out of here, Frank?

19:50.964 --> 19:54.175
There's no more
to be said about it, Mrs N.

20:00.306 --> 20:01.850
Ah.

20:09.399 --> 20:11.860
Excellent, excellent!

20:16.990 --> 20:21.327
Ah, Vena.

20:21.411 --> 20:25.290
You have come back.
The cards have drawn you.

20:28.668 --> 20:32.380
There is work for you tonight, Sonja.

21:03.912 --> 21:08.666
Vena. The cards call you.

21:08.750 --> 21:11.711
You will give them another chance?

21:11.795 --> 21:20.094
Oh, Vena! You must learn to train
your eyes, like the cat.

21:20.178 --> 21:22.180
No. I don't like the cards.

21:22.263 --> 21:24.474
Why else would you come out?

21:24.557 --> 21:26.893
A lover. A rendezvous.

21:26.976 --> 21:31.481
I know better...
Perhaps even better than little Vena...

21:31.564 --> 21:35.360
Perhaps I have seen this lover,
on the sixth card.

21:35.443 --> 21:37.153
Let go... You're hurting me.

21:37.237 --> 21:41.199
Perhaps the cards have
something to tell Vena?

21:41.282 --> 21:43.952
I doubt it.

21:44.035 --> 21:47.163
Doubts, Vena?

21:48.790 --> 21:52.335
It is not good to doubt so much.

22:03.972 --> 22:05.682
- Your parents don't know?
- Uh uh...

22:05.765 --> 22:07.976
- Good.
- I had to... sneak out.

22:08.059 --> 22:11.062
- Good.
- What do you mean, "good?"

22:11.145 --> 22:14.399
Look Venie, you don't have
to be afraid of me.

22:15.608 --> 22:17.235
I don't know why I said that.

22:17.318 --> 22:20.822
What I mean is, it's so hard
to trust anyone around this place.

22:20.905 --> 22:22.073
I know.

22:22.156 --> 22:24.868
But I feel like I can trust you, Vena.

22:26.411 --> 22:30.081
I don't understand anything
that's going on around here, Kit.

22:30.957 --> 22:33.918
I feel like a fly caught
in a spider's web.

22:34.002 --> 22:36.963
More like a butterfly.

22:37.046 --> 22:42.760
I keep looking for the spider,
searching for him before it's too late.

22:44.178 --> 22:46.431
Anyway, the car went into the tunnel.

22:46.514 --> 22:48.725
I tried to tell you before
but Blood was there.

22:48.808 --> 22:50.935
You think Mr Blood
has something to do with it.

22:51.019 --> 22:54.856
I don't know. All I know is
when the car came out of the tunnel,

22:54.939 --> 22:57.400
- the Davises were gone.
- What?

22:57.483 --> 22:59.736
The car was empty.

23:00.695 --> 23:02.614
I found these inside.

23:05.408 --> 23:07.035
Something's coming!

23:32.518 --> 23:35.146
The vents! Outside. Over it!

23:42.278 --> 23:44.280
Kit, are you all right?

23:45.239 --> 23:47.367
Hurry, he's coming!

23:53.373 --> 23:57.335
Go straight back to your trailer.
Don't stop for anyone or anything.

23:57.418 --> 24:01.005
I'll be OK. Straight back.

24:32.245 --> 24:34.288
What's that, Johnny?

24:36.207 --> 24:37.875
Car trouble?

24:40.795 --> 24:43.381
Vena's going to be disappointed.

24:43.464 --> 24:46.217
- She's gone.
- Hold on, Johnny.

24:46.300 --> 24:48.970
- I'm going after her.
- What should I tell him?

24:49.053 --> 24:50.847
Where have you been?

24:50.930 --> 24:53.266
I just went outside.

24:53.349 --> 24:55.643
We were worried.

24:57.562 --> 24:59.856
- Who is it?
- Johnny's on the phone.

24:59.939 --> 25:06.696
Johnny? When are you coming?
Oh... Of course. Whenever you can.

25:12.994 --> 25:15.747
Last night
you should have heard me weep.

25:15.830 --> 25:18.541
I dreamt I saw a dwarf asleep

25:19.417 --> 25:22.003
who dreamt he saw a girl in danger,

25:22.086 --> 25:25.548
who dreamt she met
a handsome stranger.

25:25.631 --> 25:28.634
- Or was it a dream?
- You tell me.

25:28.718 --> 25:33.056
No, no. Not fair.
Bobo is not smart.

25:33.139 --> 25:38.644
Pity poor Bobo, who doesn't sleep,
who doesn't have a brain like everyone.

25:40.146 --> 25:46.069
Beware of evil
who strikes in the shadow of the dream.

25:46.152 --> 25:47.153
Bobo!

25:47.236 --> 25:52.241
Beware of the mystery of the Carnival
which shall remain nameless.

25:52.325 --> 25:53.910
Bobo!

25:53.993 --> 25:54.994
Vena?

25:59.499 --> 26:01.125
Vena?

26:02.293 --> 26:04.962
- Make him go away.
- Who?

26:05.046 --> 26:07.256
Him.

26:07.340 --> 26:10.468
- What are you talking about?
- He was just right there!

26:10.551 --> 26:12.553
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing! There was a dwarf there.

26:12.637 --> 26:16.432
He was pointing a gun at me.
He was going to shoot me.

26:17.558 --> 26:19.560
Don't you believe me?

26:19.644 --> 26:21.687
I tell you, there was a dwarf there!

26:21.771 --> 26:24.482
Why don't you go back to the trailer
and lie down.

26:24.565 --> 26:27.151
I'll mind the shop.

26:40.498 --> 26:43.376
- Are you all right?
- Oh, hi Vena.

26:43.459 --> 26:45.962
Yeah, I got past that dummy
all right last night.

26:46.045 --> 26:47.672
I guess you're OK too.

26:47.755 --> 26:50.174
Is that all you have to say?

26:50.258 --> 26:54.095
I know what you mean.
I guess I'm still in shock or something.

26:54.178 --> 26:56.305
It was like a dream.

26:56.389 --> 26:58.057
Not really.

26:59.684 --> 27:01.727
Does it hurt?

27:01.811 --> 27:04.272
Only when I laugh!

27:04.355 --> 27:08.484
Seriously, it does hurt. Blood was
quite interested in it this morning.

27:09.527 --> 27:11.737
Did you find anything
in the tunnel today?

27:11.821 --> 27:14.073
That's a good one.
Blood's been around all day.

27:14.157 --> 27:18.035
Either in the tunnel, or out here
watching over his gold mine.

27:18.119 --> 27:21.122
Is he coming tonight?

27:22.456 --> 27:25.168
The Ferris Wheel... at two o'clock.

27:26.127 --> 27:31.465
My, my. What an unusual day,
eh, my two young love birds.

27:31.549 --> 27:34.760
No, no, don't be embarrassed.
I can tell the signs.

27:34.844 --> 27:37.054
Vena's a lucky girl, eh Kit?

27:37.138 --> 27:40.641
Spring's in the air
and she has two lovers to choose from.

27:46.397 --> 27:48.065
Didn't she tell you?

27:48.149 --> 27:50.693
Ah, there I go
opening my big mouth again.

27:50.776 --> 27:53.112
When's Johnny coming, Vena?

27:53.196 --> 27:55.740
Cat got your tongue? Tomorrow is it?

27:55.823 --> 27:57.617
Well, I guess so.

27:57.700 --> 28:01.871
They're fickle, Kit, my boy.
You have a lotto learn.

28:30.399 --> 28:35.988
Step right in, ladies and gentleman.
Step right in.

28:36.072 --> 28:40.868
No, no. Don't be afraid
to bring the children.

28:40.952 --> 28:42.954
We have special treats for children.

28:44.205 --> 28:49.919
Just five tickets to see the world's
only living two-headed giraffe.

28:50.002 --> 28:53.089
He won't be alive much longer.

28:53.172 --> 28:59.637
Or see the Siamese twins wiggle
and swim in their big blue bottle.

28:59.720 --> 29:03.599
Don't be afraid.
They can't get out.

29:03.683 --> 29:09.730
See Gilda the bearded giantess
waltz with Bobo the dwarf.

29:09.814 --> 29:11.816
Or simply try your luck at...

29:12.775 --> 29:14.944
Try your luck at...

29:15.027 --> 29:17.405
Try your luck at...

29:17.488 --> 29:19.782
Try your luck at...

29:19.865 --> 29:22.159
Try your luck at...

29:22.243 --> 29:24.412
Try your luck at...

29:24.495 --> 29:26.497
Try your luck at...

29:26.580 --> 29:28.916
Try your luck at...

29:37.550 --> 29:41.387
I want the secret.

34:46.317 --> 34:48.569
- Gone, again!
- Now, Frank.

34:48.652 --> 34:50.904
- That kid!
- What are you doing?

34:50.987 --> 34:54.241
- Going after her.
- No. Frank, it's dangerous. I don't like it.

34:54.324 --> 34:56.284
That's why I'm going.

35:50.297 --> 35:53.342
We must calm the girl, Blood.

35:53.425 --> 35:58.597
My dear. My dear. You are so upset.

35:58.681 --> 36:02.601
My dear. Yes, it's too bad
about poor, poor Kit.

36:02.685 --> 36:05.229
Don't be so upset though.

36:13.904 --> 36:16.824
Frank... Frank!

36:24.748 --> 36:27.167
Somebody help!

36:28.627 --> 36:30.462
No!

36:34.299 --> 36:35.676
Frank!

36:35.759 --> 36:39.096
Go away! Go!

37:23.223 --> 37:25.601
Answer, please answer...!

37:28.687 --> 37:31.315
Operator, this is an emergency.

37:31.398 --> 37:35.194
I can't speak any louder,
this is an emergency.

37:35.277 --> 37:37.905
What? Please!

37:40.824 --> 37:42.785
I don't know, local.

37:44.703 --> 37:46.789
Hurry, Operator!

37:52.544 --> 37:54.588
Carnival!

39:45.449 --> 39:47.159
It's useless.

39:48.035 --> 39:52.789
It's dead. Somebody must have cut
the wires or something.

39:52.873 --> 39:54.541
Still out there.

39:55.959 --> 39:59.004
What are we going to do, Frank?
What are we going to do?

39:59.087 --> 40:03.425
Get out of here. They've got us
trapped like rats. Make a run for it.

40:03.508 --> 40:05.302
Got one.

40:09.640 --> 40:12.809
I'm sorry. Calm down, Mrs Norris.
There's hope yet.

40:12.893 --> 40:16.396
They can't seem to move very fast...
those things out there.

40:16.480 --> 40:20.025
I've got a plan:
we'll make a break for it,

40:20.108 --> 40:23.487
set the trailer on fire,
and try to find Vena in the confusion.

40:23.570 --> 40:26.531
Frank, what are you saying?
You're crazy.

40:26.615 --> 40:30.452
Like a fox. When those propane tanks
blow, it'll light up the whole sky.

40:30.535 --> 40:33.413
- The whole town will be here.
- What about Vena?

43:58.368 --> 44:01.538
- What happened here?
- Accident, Johnny.

44:01.621 --> 44:03.707
Say, how do you know my name?

44:03.790 --> 44:06.960
- What's that?
- How do you know my name?

44:07.043 --> 44:12.132
Oh, that. Why, the Norrises told me
you were coming, of course.

44:12.215 --> 44:14.926
Pretty girl, that Vena.

44:15.010 --> 44:19.181
If I were 20 years younger, you young
butts wouldn't have had a chance.

44:19.264 --> 44:22.184
This was their trailer

44:23.226 --> 44:26.813
- What?
- Pretty girl, that Vena Norris.

44:26.897 --> 44:28.940
You just said something
about this trailer.

44:29.024 --> 44:33.445
It's theirs, the Norrises'.
Or was, I should say.

44:33.528 --> 44:38.533
- Are they all right? Where are they?
- Oh, boy. Don't take it hard.

44:38.617 --> 44:42.954
They're at rest. While we poor slobs
have to struggle on through life.

44:43.038 --> 44:46.666
Carry their burden, you know.
They would have wanted it that way.

44:46.750 --> 44:50.086
In the short time I knew the Norrises,
I came to feel that they...

44:50.170 --> 44:54.090
- What are you talking about?
- Don't take it hard boy.

44:54.174 --> 44:57.260
They died in their sleep.
A freak accident.

44:57.344 --> 44:59.888
You know how shoddy
these trailers are...

44:59.971 --> 45:05.602
Go up, whoosh, like a torch.
Took a fireman with it.

45:05.685 --> 45:08.647
Don't take it so bad, boy.
You got a long life.

45:08.730 --> 45:12.400
There's lots of fish in the sea.
You know what I mean?

46:19.259 --> 46:21.177
Let yourself in.

46:22.470 --> 46:27.017
Yes. The door was open.
There didn't seem to be anybody about.

46:27.100 --> 46:29.602
You've come to work.

46:29.686 --> 46:31.688
Sign here.

46:36.860 --> 46:39.029
No, you misunderstood me.

46:41.114 --> 46:44.326
These names. I know the Norrises.

46:44.409 --> 46:47.412
I was told I could find out
about them here.

46:47.495 --> 46:49.789
- Luck.
- What's that?

46:49.873 --> 46:51.875
Luck. You'd need good luck.

46:53.209 --> 46:58.173
Accidents, we've had
lots of accidents here.

47:03.803 --> 47:05.930
You like books?

47:06.014 --> 47:09.017
I saw you looking at my picture book.

47:09.100 --> 47:11.895
Look here, how they cut the feet off.

47:13.646 --> 47:15.607
Here...

47:18.026 --> 47:22.906
where they quarter him,
as neat a job as you'd want to see.

47:25.867 --> 47:27.702
Listen, lad.

47:27.786 --> 47:33.792
They say that meat builds blood
and flesh and gives you new life.

47:33.875 --> 47:38.004
- Do you believe that?
- Yes, I guess so.

47:38.088 --> 47:40.090
So wouldn't it follow

47:40.173 --> 47:44.469
that a man could live longer and longer
if he ate more of the same.

47:59.359 --> 48:00.944
Vena?

48:04.656 --> 48:06.783
Vena!

48:16.000 --> 48:20.004
<i>Very, very not yet dead
Stupid Johnny, use your head!</i>

48:21.047 --> 48:24.592
<i>Put your feet where evil stands</i>

48:24.676 --> 48:28.721
<i>The knife cuts quick
The blood pours red</i>

48:28.805 --> 48:31.516
<i>Stupid Johnny, use your head!</i>

48:31.599 --> 48:33.810
<i>Very, very not yet dead</i>

49:22.358 --> 49:23.985
Quasimodo!

49:24.777 --> 49:25.778
Hurry!

50:29.676 --> 50:32.053
Come on, dear girl.

50:32.136 --> 50:34.138
Wake up!

50:34.222 --> 50:36.933
That's enough sleeping, Vena.

50:37.016 --> 50:39.018
You've got to get up.

50:40.353 --> 50:41.896
That's better.

50:41.980 --> 50:44.399
They've come to help you escape.

50:45.358 --> 50:48.278
That's it, wake up.

50:48.361 --> 50:51.197
Come on, you can do it.

50:51.281 --> 50:54.576
You've got to walk around.
It's the only thing.

50:54.659 --> 50:58.746
You've been drugged.
You've got to fight it.

50:59.831 --> 51:01.916
It's Mr Blood, Vena dear.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.002
I've come to help you
out of the frying pan.

51:04.085 --> 51:07.880
- No, you're bad.
- No, that's enough.

51:07.964 --> 51:12.051
You must be quiet.
I want to help you escape.

51:12.135 --> 51:15.221
That's enough!
I want to help you!

51:15.305 --> 51:16.764
You're evil.

51:16.848 --> 51:20.310
No, I'm not, Vena.
You must believe me.

51:20.393 --> 51:23.229
I want to take you out of here.

51:23.313 --> 51:25.315
Take you to Johnny.

51:25.398 --> 51:28.067
Take you to your family.

51:28.151 --> 51:30.445
- Why?
- He's come.

51:30.528 --> 51:33.072
He's waiting outside.

51:33.156 --> 51:36.576
- Why? Malatesta's...
- Shh!

51:38.328 --> 51:41.164
He is mad and evil.

51:41.247 --> 51:46.294
Too evil. I want to destroy him.
I didn't realise.

51:46.377 --> 51:48.212
Will you come?

51:49.922 --> 51:53.843
Can you make it?
Remember, no noise.

51:55.053 --> 51:57.180
Here, take my hand

52:12.570 --> 52:16.574
- We keep going down.
- Illusion, Vena, dear.

52:16.658 --> 52:20.703
This carnival was constructed over
a series of natural limestone caverns.

52:20.787 --> 52:24.332
That is how Bean kept his family
undetected for so many years.

52:24.415 --> 52:27.585
- Family?
- And they're cannibals, every one.

52:27.669 --> 52:30.296
Most of them have never seen
the light of day.

52:30.380 --> 52:33.549
That's why they look so ghastly.
Live like animals

52:33.633 --> 52:35.677
Nobody's ever told them
that eating people is wrong.

52:35.760 --> 52:38.513
- So how are they to know?
- But you knew.

52:38.596 --> 52:42.266
- Why didn't you tell?
- Ah, but I didn't know at first.

52:42.350 --> 52:45.311
I was driven out of town you know.
Took refuge here.

52:45.395 --> 52:48.564
I thought it was a good future,
this carnival business.

52:48.648 --> 52:50.566
Then I found out I couldn't leave.

52:50.650 --> 52:53.528
You'll be safe here

52:53.611 --> 52:56.030
Safe enough, Vena. This way.

53:00.952 --> 53:02.620
- Oh...
- No!

53:04.664 --> 53:06.249
No!

53:14.674 --> 53:17.009
Stop it!

53:20.930 --> 53:23.558
- Stop it!
- Let me go!

53:23.641 --> 53:25.435
That is enough!

53:25.518 --> 53:27.937
Enough! Enough!

53:42.577 --> 53:43.995
Stop it.

53:45.246 --> 53:47.665
You... you mad woman.

53:50.042 --> 53:52.336
Stop. Stop!

54:01.554 --> 54:06.559
It wouldn't do
to have you drugged, Vena.

54:06.642 --> 54:09.437
You must bear the pain

54:09.520 --> 54:12.273
while I drain you of your precious blood.

54:22.366 --> 54:25.620
No! No!

55:02.406 --> 55:06.160
The blood of life. <i>Prosit!</i>

55:31.310 --> 55:35.022
I found her, wandering the cellars.

55:36.649 --> 55:39.193
Surely this isn't forbidden.

55:39.277 --> 55:42.613
You gave me a taste for the blood.

55:42.697 --> 55:44.699
I needed her blood.

55:46.325 --> 55:48.870
You will not deny me this, will you?

55:50.288 --> 55:52.331
Malatesta!

55:59.964 --> 56:02.008
You are still the master, of course.

56:03.009 --> 56:05.511
You will forgive me this lapse.

56:06.804 --> 56:08.931
It will not happen again.

56:09.932 --> 56:12.018
Malatesta!

56:12.101 --> 56:17.648
It is time for you
to see my face, Mr Blood.

56:17.732 --> 56:20.067
No... No!

56:21.402 --> 56:23.654
No. No!

56:33.623 --> 56:37.043
I am a man of a thousand faces, Vena.

56:37.126 --> 56:41.172
Mr Blood has seen my face of madness.

56:42.256 --> 56:46.594
But to you I show a kinder face.

57:30.304 --> 57:31.639
Vena!

57:32.556 --> 57:35.309
- Vena!
- Is that you, Johnny?

57:37.687 --> 57:39.313
Why can't this move?

57:39.397 --> 57:41.524
Hurry, Vena! Hurry!

57:50.324 --> 57:53.327
- Is it really you?
- It's me, Vena.

57:53.411 --> 57:56.288
- Don't worry.
- We've got to get out of here.

57:56.372 --> 57:57.999
No kidding.

57:58.082 --> 58:00.084
My parents. Did you see them?

58:00.167 --> 58:04.964
Yes. They told me...
They told me you were dead too.

58:06.382 --> 58:08.509
Come on, let's go.

58:26.777 --> 58:29.321
- Frank, what was that?
- Nothing.

58:29.405 --> 58:31.407
- I heard something.
- Shut up!

58:31.490 --> 58:33.492
Oh, Frank!

58:35.077 --> 58:36.620
It's nothing.

58:36.704 --> 58:38.956
It's not nothing. It's an omen.

58:39.040 --> 58:41.667
Frank, I say we should get the police.

58:41.751 --> 58:44.128
Can't trust them. They wouldn't come.

58:44.211 --> 58:45.838
We don't know that.

58:45.921 --> 58:48.340
Did anybody come
when the trailer burnt? They saw!

58:48.424 --> 58:50.843
They just wouldn't come.
Nobody cares.

59:05.649 --> 59:07.818
Vena's down there, I know it!

59:07.902 --> 59:09.904
Where are we, Frank?

59:09.987 --> 59:12.031
I don't know. Under the carnival, I think.

59:57.493 --> 59:58.911
Frank!

01:02:01.909 --> 01:02:03.702
Malatesta!

01:02:13.212 --> 01:02:15.714
Malatesta, I'm coming after you!

01:02:52.042 --> 01:02:54.753
They smell the blood, Vena.

01:02:57.423 --> 01:02:59.341
It is not safe here.

01:02:59.425 --> 01:03:02.553
You must follow me.

01:03:02.636 --> 01:03:05.139
I will take you to safety.

01:03:07.224 --> 01:03:09.601
Trust me, Vena.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.939
I will take you to your parents.

01:06:23.795 --> 01:06:29.468
I saw you! I saw you!

01:06:29.551 --> 01:06:32.846
Ah, no, no, no. Mercy, mercy.

01:06:33.805 --> 01:06:37.309
Please. Have pity on poor Bobo.

01:06:37.392 --> 01:06:39.394
Please, mercy.

01:07:14.429 --> 01:07:19.059
Come along. Don't be afraid.

01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:29.630
Let me out!

01:08:33.133 --> 01:08:35.594
Let me out!

01:08:37.763 --> 01:08:39.723
Let me out!

01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:43.810
Let me out! Let me out!

01:08:43.894 --> 01:08:46.270
Well, looks like another dead end.

01:08:46.354 --> 01:08:49.399
You understand, Mr Malatesta,
we have to check these things out.

01:08:49.483 --> 01:08:51.193
Of course.

01:08:51.276 --> 01:08:54.904
And you think I can get protection
from your fellas in the winter then?

01:08:54.988 --> 01:08:56.990
Sure, sure, no problem there.

01:08:57.073 --> 01:08:59.408
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to thank you for...

01:08:59.493 --> 01:09:01.118
- Come.
- What's this?

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:02.703
Try your skill.

01:09:02.787 --> 01:09:07.125
Bobo will be very honoured
if you toss the first ball of the season.

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:09.711
Why, sure, little fella.

01:09:09.795 --> 01:09:12.421
- Cute little fella, isn't he?
- Oh, yes.

01:09:28.438 --> 01:09:30.482
Ah!

01:09:36.697 --> 01:09:38.948
The old arm's not what it used to be.

01:09:39.032 --> 01:09:41.158
Try again. Try again.

01:09:55.799 --> 01:09:59.177
Very good!

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:01.263
Excellent, excellent.
