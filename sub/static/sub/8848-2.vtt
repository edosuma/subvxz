Previously on AMC's "Hell On Wheels".

00:03.676 --> 00:04.933
Tell me about Meridian.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.291
How do you know about Meridian?

00:07.224 --> 00:08.499
Are you a gunslinger then?

00:08.556 --> 00:11.056
I was just heading out west,
looking for work on the railroad.

00:11.294 --> 00:14.127
The thing's government
pays me per mile.

00:14.175 --> 00:15.388
You putting up a church here?

00:16.411 --> 00:17.511
You have to say the word.

00:19.301 --> 00:20.990
Nothing about... Maps being found?

00:31.558 --> 00:32.198
No, sir.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.427
You ever been to
Meridian, Mississippi?

00:24.683 --> 00:27.499
I am not proud of what
happened to your wife.

01:00.106 --> 01:01.725
Mr. Durant.

01:07.856 --> 01:09.858
What the hell is he doing here?

01:12.125 --> 01:14.823
Are you the Chicago Tribune reporter?

01:14.989 --> 01:16.104
Yes.

01:16.229 --> 01:17.439
Did you photograph this body?

01:17.564 --> 01:20.412
Yes, sir, Mr. Durant.
But just the one body.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.325
What is wrong with you, man?

01:23.496 --> 01:25.000
I'm sorry. I thought...

01:25.165 --> 01:26.959
Well, just the one won't do.

01:28.334 --> 01:32.047
Get those bodies back off the wagons.

01:32.213 --> 01:33.882
Come on, snap to, boys.

01:34.048 --> 01:37.089
I want this scene photographed

01:37.214 --> 01:38.554
exactly as you found it.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.347
I want an unblinking look

01:40.513 --> 01:42.391
at the horror perpetrated here.

01:43.725 --> 01:45.185
More arrows.

01:45.351 --> 01:47.325
We need more arrows.

02:09.318 --> 02:11.396
He can't feel anything.

02:11.521 --> 02:14.023
He's dead, for God's sake.

02:16.027 --> 02:18.594
The maps.

02:19.010 --> 02:20.054
Did you find them?

02:20.220 --> 02:22.056
No, sir. Nothing anywhere.

02:22.222 --> 02:24.016
Keep looking.

02:24.182 --> 02:26.226
Mr. Durant, over here.

02:39.154 --> 02:41.158
Robert.

02:47.996 --> 02:49.306
Pack up everything.

02:49.431 --> 02:52.233
Bring it all back to hell on wheels.

04:57.893 --> 05:00.271
They found Johnson's body.

05:00.396 --> 05:03.048
Everybody back at the
camp talkin' about it.

05:03.265 --> 05:05.534
Get the hell back to that cut.

05:08.571 --> 05:10.639
Cullen Bohannon?

05:13.307 --> 05:16.519
Did you hear about
Daniel Johnson's murder?

05:16.685 --> 05:19.064
Who wants to know?

05:20.383 --> 05:22.192
Why you so spooked, son?

05:22.358 --> 05:24.963
I guess I still ain't quite cottoned

05:25.088 --> 05:27.280
to the sight of union
blue riding up on me.

05:28.588 --> 05:31.447
Well, you ought to be happy to see us.

05:31.613 --> 05:33.157
Yeah, why is that?

05:33.323 --> 05:37.162
The boss wants to talk to you
about taking Johnson's job.

06:45.562 --> 06:47.708
I thank thee, lord,

06:47.833 --> 06:52.470
for is bounty you have
placed before me.

06:56.876 --> 06:58.753
Sit down.

06:58.878 --> 07:00.644
Sit down.

07:10.962 --> 07:12.757
Horse thief.

07:14.049 --> 07:16.367
Thor Gunderson.

07:16.492 --> 07:18.804
Head of security for Mr.
Thomas Durant.

07:18.970 --> 07:21.062
They call me the Swede.

07:23.265 --> 07:24.976
I'm Norwegian.

07:25.101 --> 07:29.914
No matter. We are all Americans now.

07:30.039 --> 07:32.359
Even you rebels, yes?

07:33.985 --> 07:35.820
Hmm.

07:36.945 --> 07:39.636
Daniel Johnson told me that the two

07:39.637 --> 07:43.537
of you was cut from the same cloth.

07:45.056 --> 07:48.167
Yeah, I don't think so.

07:48.333 --> 07:49.637
Why is that?

07:49.762 --> 07:51.879
Did you not like him?

07:52.045 --> 07:53.508
He's my boss.

07:53.638 --> 07:55.137
That's about all there was to it.

07:55.303 --> 07:57.250
And drinking companion, yes?

07:57.375 --> 07:58.985
We tore it up some.

07:59.110 --> 08:02.311
I understand the two
of you was tearing it up

08:02.477 --> 08:05.856
some on the night he was murdered.

08:06.022 --> 08:11.364
In fact, you were seen
leaving the saloon with him.

08:11.489 --> 08:13.280
Hmm?

08:13.446 --> 08:15.726
Yeah.

08:17.028 --> 08:19.620
I'm not here to talk
about Johnson's job, am I?

08:19.786 --> 08:21.705
Is that what they told you?

08:25.125 --> 08:26.252
You a law man, Mr. Swede?

08:26.418 --> 08:27.378
Hmm?

08:27.544 --> 08:29.171
Because I don't see no badge.

08:29.337 --> 08:30.584
Hmm, no.

08:30.709 --> 08:33.299
There's no official law out here yet.

08:33.466 --> 08:35.510
Then what auority you got
to be interrogating me?

08:35.677 --> 08:43.602
Mr. Durant has appointed me to bring
some order to the chaos out here.

08:43.768 --> 08:47.202
When was the last time you
took a look outside, Mr. Swede?

08:47.327 --> 08:49.650
Looks to me like chaos is winning.

08:49.816 --> 08:54.611
Ah, when whorlets and
dipsomaniacs are killed,

08:54.736 --> 08:57.158
I lose not a minute's sleep,

08:57.324 --> 09:03.456
but Daniel Johnson... Was a
valuable asset to Mr. Durant.

09:03.622 --> 09:06.625
Daniel Johnson was hated by just
about every man who worked for him.

09:06.791 --> 09:10.171
Ah. Any with a reason to kill him?

09:11.621 --> 09:16.401
Perhaps one of the negroes?

09:16.526 --> 09:19.930
I heard he had some
trouble with them. Hmm?

09:20.096 --> 09:23.642
Yeah, I don't know nothin' about that.

09:25.034 --> 09:26.544
Mm-hmm.

09:26.669 --> 09:28.230
Yeah.

09:33.068 --> 09:35.404
Well, that leaves only you then.

09:37.046 --> 09:38.455
You know what?

09:38.580 --> 09:40.034
I'm done here.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.827
This ain't no court.

09:48.424 --> 09:50.961
This here's beauty.

09:51.494 --> 09:56.759
She's an old piece, but
she still shoots true.

10:11.773 --> 10:16.195
I'm gonna give you a chance
to confess to this crime.

13:29.971 --> 13:32.749
Where is she?

13:32.874 --> 13:34.393
Hello, little brother.

13:34.559 --> 13:36.103
What are you doing way out here?

13:38.771 --> 13:41.233
Where's the woman?

13:41.399 --> 13:45.827
I don't have her... Yet.

13:45.952 --> 13:49.116
You kill white men, it's one thing,

13:49.282 --> 13:51.232
but you take one of their women,

13:51.357 --> 13:53.537
you'll have every damn one
of them hunting you down.

13:53.703 --> 13:54.836
Good.

13:54.961 --> 13:57.249
I'll count coup and get more scalps.

13:58.832 --> 14:00.961
I hope it was worth it.

14:01.127 --> 14:02.421
What about all the scalps you took?

14:02.587 --> 14:05.215
You act so pure now,

14:05.381 --> 14:09.219
but I remember there was a time
when you loved the taste of blood.

14:13.251 --> 14:15.646
Jesus has forgiven me for that.

14:15.804 --> 14:18.223
Jesus may have forgiven you,

14:18.348 --> 14:21.144
but do you think your
white friends would?

14:27.983 --> 14:30.195
You better find her before I do.

14:43.874 --> 14:46.044
Hey.

14:46.276 --> 14:49.380
Hey!

14:49.547 --> 14:52.759
You'd be surprised how fast you
get used to the feel of them things.

14:52.925 --> 14:55.085
What the hell are you doing here?

14:56.421 --> 14:59.599
Want to know if you fixin'
to be testifying on me.

14:59.765 --> 15:03.311
I don't know, ain't decided yet.

15:03.477 --> 15:05.772
I know 'bout that sergeant.

15:05.897 --> 15:08.541
Heard Johnson say
some other things, too.

15:08.666 --> 15:11.361
Things 'bout men gettin'
killed in churches and such.

15:11.527 --> 15:13.029
Yeah, what's your point?

15:13.195 --> 15:15.014
Point is, if I be hangin' for Johnson,

15:15.139 --> 15:18.675
then you gonna drop down right beside
me for them folks you done killed.

15:19.911 --> 15:21.854
Tell you what.

15:21.979 --> 15:26.251
You tell your story
and then I'll tell mine.

15:26.417 --> 15:29.087
We'll see who they believe.

15:30.521 --> 15:32.130
Yeah.

15:32.255 --> 15:35.718
Who will believe some nigger
slave over a white man?

15:38.529 --> 15:40.506
Relax, son.

15:40.631 --> 15:42.141
Ain't nobody hangin' nobody.

15:42.266 --> 15:43.942
I ain't your damn son.

15:44.067 --> 15:46.579
Well, I'll be out of here by tomorrow.

15:46.704 --> 15:49.148
I imagine that's what
that horse thief done said.

15:58.449 --> 16:00.025
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

16:00.150 --> 16:01.826
- Thanks so much.
- See you again.

16:01.951 --> 16:03.746
- Good luck.
- Cheers.

16:03.912 --> 16:05.206
Good luck.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.631
Did you enjoy the show, sir?

16:13.797 --> 16:17.927
Very moving images of home, boys.

16:18.093 --> 16:20.478
But you don't sound Irish.

16:20.603 --> 16:26.117
I ain't, but my heart
was moved nonetheless.

16:26.242 --> 16:32.734
We're all yearning for our homeland
out here in this strange place.

16:34.583 --> 16:38.072
Excuse me, sir, have we met?

16:38.238 --> 16:39.862
We have not.

16:39.987 --> 16:42.952
Folks around here call me the Swede.

16:43.118 --> 16:47.159
You got yourself a prime
location here, boys.

16:47.706 --> 16:50.071
Yes, siree, right between
the whores and liquor.

16:50.196 --> 16:53.254
Picked it out meself.

16:53.420 --> 16:54.380
What is it you want, Mr. Swede?

16:54.600 --> 16:56.910
I like that, right to the point.

16:57.035 --> 16:58.712
And the point is,

16:58.837 --> 17:02.180
a nice location like this got
a nice price attached to it.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.019
I should have realized

17:05.144 --> 17:07.021
there was a reason
this spot wasn't taken.

17:07.146 --> 17:08.895
I shoulda seen this comin'.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.439
I take it then, you're the smart one.

17:11.605 --> 17:15.230
Aye. Aye.

17:15.355 --> 17:17.098
So, how much do you want, Mr. Swede?

17:17.223 --> 17:21.699
Oh, once again, right to the point.

17:21.865 --> 17:24.939
Uh, $2.00 a week.

17:25.064 --> 17:27.454
The first payment due this Friday.

17:27.621 --> 17:29.874
But that's half our flippin' take.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.181
For this $2.00, you
shall have my protection

17:33.306 --> 17:36.676
against all the villains that
surround you in this wicked place.

17:37.256 --> 17:38.633
And what if we don't pay?

17:38.799 --> 17:42.345
You can always move down
to the slaughterhouse.

17:42.511 --> 17:46.053
And what if we refuse to move?

17:47.656 --> 17:51.270
And I thought you was the smart one.

18:40.512 --> 18:43.531
You know I used to be a bookkeeper.

18:45.516 --> 18:48.036
You look like a bookkeeper.

18:48.202 --> 18:52.432
Hmm. I was always more comfortable
around numbers than people.

18:52.557 --> 18:54.959
I could control numbers.

18:55.125 --> 18:57.336
The war put a stop to that, didn't it?

19:01.701 --> 19:04.969
You're suffering from the
soldier's heart, Mr. Swede.

19:05.135 --> 19:07.889
I can see it in your eyes.

19:08.055 --> 19:10.600
You're still fighting them battles.

19:10.766 --> 19:12.121
I saw no battles.

19:12.246 --> 19:14.062
I was a quartermaster.

19:14.228 --> 19:17.565
More numbers.

19:17.731 --> 19:21.931
Hmm. I never even saw the enemy

19:22.056 --> 19:25.235
until our supply train
was captured and...

19:25.360 --> 19:29.077
I become prisoner of war.

19:30.499 --> 19:32.121
Andersonville?

19:34.503 --> 19:36.626
That's right.

19:36.792 --> 19:41.255
Way down in the great
state of Georgia.

19:41.421 --> 19:44.008
Total chaos ruled.

19:44.174 --> 19:48.728
30,000 prisoners, 14,000 dead.

19:48.853 --> 19:54.936
I weighed 200 pounds when I
went in and 86 when I come out.

19:55.102 --> 19:59.982
I just couldn't make
them numbers add up.

20:01.231 --> 20:05.534
I woke one night to one of my own men

20:06.113 --> 20:08.324
trying to eat the flesh from my arm.

20:08.490 --> 20:10.284
He thought I was dead.

20:10.450 --> 20:15.486
I realized that night
I had to control people

20:15.630 --> 20:18.642
like I controlled numbers

20:18.767 --> 20:28.186
and I learned to practice a
sort of immoral mathematics.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.956
I did some...

20:35.653 --> 20:41.025
Not so good things in
Andersonville, Mr. Bohannon.

20:44.096 --> 20:51.344
In the end I found I was able
to make them numbers add up.

20:52.938 --> 20:55.891
Mmm.

20:57.376 --> 21:02.063
So, have you thought
about that confession?

21:03.882 --> 21:05.959
Well, I figured by your math,

21:06.084 --> 21:08.236
you're gonna hang me either way.

21:10.121 --> 21:11.655
Yeah.

21:17.196 --> 21:20.742
You know why that man didn't
finish eating your sorry ass?

21:20.867 --> 21:24.169
Mm-mmm. Hmm?

21:24.335 --> 21:27.589
'Cause you Yankees all
taste like trash.

21:28.172 --> 21:30.244
Ah!

21:37.319 --> 21:41.065
Get right with your maker, Mr.
Bohannon.

21:41.190 --> 21:44.134
Soon as we cut down the horse thief...

21:44.259 --> 21:46.527
You're gonna hang.

24:53.210 --> 24:54.963
Write this down.

24:55.129 --> 24:57.157
Outnumbered five to one,

24:57.282 --> 25:01.061
eight white Christian souls
were brutally slaughtered

25:01.186 --> 25:06.534
by the marauding, bloodthirsty
war party of merciless savages.

25:06.659 --> 25:07.934
Outnumbered five to one?

25:08.100 --> 25:09.938
Make it ten to one.

25:10.063 --> 25:14.242
Amongst the murdered were Robert Bell,

25:14.367 --> 25:19.580
visionary surveyor of the
Union Pacific Railroad...

25:19.705 --> 25:23.533
His beautiful wife lily,

25:23.699 --> 25:26.887
the fair haired maiden of the west,

25:27.012 --> 25:30.023
was sullied by the savage pack,

25:30.148 --> 25:33.026
then carried off into slavery
in their filthy camp...

25:33.151 --> 25:34.586
What... what does sullied mean again?

25:34.752 --> 25:37.338
It will mean whatever the
reader wants it to mean.

25:37.504 --> 25:43.720
My road will bring civilization
to these untamed Western lands.

25:43.886 --> 25:46.440
And the fair-haired maiden of the west

25:46.565 --> 25:50.111
represents nothing less
than civilization itself.

25:50.236 --> 25:54.449
You see... you see this
as sort of a rallying cry?

25:54.574 --> 25:55.817
Yes.

25:55.942 --> 25:57.252
Now you're getting it.

25:57.377 --> 25:58.920
Save her at all costs.

25:59.045 --> 26:00.528
Well, yes, of course, save her,

26:00.694 --> 26:04.492
but I also want the federal
troops brought in here

26:04.617 --> 26:08.686
to clear every single last
savage from the path of my road.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.072
Welcome, brother.

28:09.977 --> 28:12.154
You must be that feller they're...

28:12.279 --> 28:13.745
They're looking to hang.

28:17.651 --> 28:19.394
You know, Saint Peter himself

28:19.519 --> 28:24.532
was...Chained like this
and condemned to die.

28:24.657 --> 28:26.966
And he was freed by an angel.

28:31.178 --> 28:32.889
I ain't no Saint Peter, sir.

28:33.055 --> 28:35.558
Yeah, and I ain't no angel.

28:52.687 --> 28:54.243
Peace be with you, sir.

28:54.409 --> 28:56.496
I'm with you, reverend. I'm with you.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.336
I hear your prisoner escaped.

29:03.502 --> 29:05.708
Oh, we'll find him.

29:05.833 --> 29:07.256
It's just a matter of time.

29:07.422 --> 29:09.759
I'll be sure to keep
an eye out for him.

29:09.925 --> 29:12.679
You be careful. He's a dangerous man.

29:27.489 --> 29:30.959
Brother... We need to talk.

29:32.328 --> 29:34.409
I thought you were gonna turn me in.

29:34.575 --> 29:38.246
No. The lord instructs me to give
sanctuary even to the condemned.

29:38.412 --> 29:40.211
Yeah?

29:40.336 --> 29:44.627
What does he say about cutting
off a pair of cuffs, huh?

29:44.793 --> 29:47.130
You're on your own there.

29:49.923 --> 29:51.556
You know...

29:51.681 --> 29:53.158
You'd best set things straight

29:53.283 --> 29:56.055
in your heart before
you go a-swingin', son.

29:57.854 --> 29:59.665
They ain't gonna hang me.

29:59.790 --> 30:02.467
Well, nevertheless, ha ha.

30:02.592 --> 30:05.237
One day your name will be called.

30:05.362 --> 30:08.776
And on that day, you must answer.

30:12.369 --> 30:14.537
I know it.

30:16.373 --> 30:18.494
Yeah, and what are you gonna say?

30:19.810 --> 30:23.124
I did the best I could in a bad time.

30:24.715 --> 30:28.961
Yeah, see, I understand
that better than you know,

30:29.086 --> 30:32.398
but it won't be good enough for him.

30:32.523 --> 30:37.035
So, all you got to do is
get down on your knees...

30:37.160 --> 30:41.763
Yeah. I seen plenty of
men get down on their knees

30:42.309 --> 30:44.187
and call out his name
in terrible times.

30:44.353 --> 30:47.648
I seen their prayers answered
with a bullet more often than not.

30:49.105 --> 30:53.017
It's hard to comprehend I...
Son, I know.

30:53.142 --> 30:55.573
It's impossible sometimes, but...

30:55.739 --> 31:00.787
But he is here...And his
mercy knows no bounds.

31:00.953 --> 31:04.415
Just bend them knees
and ask for forgiveness.

31:06.422 --> 31:08.033
No, sir.

31:08.158 --> 31:10.192
I won't do it.

31:11.428 --> 31:13.382
Because the war took your faith?

31:15.165 --> 31:17.833
Because I don't deserve forgiveness.

31:36.655 --> 31:39.742
Oy. We can't use that.

31:39.908 --> 31:42.662
Ma would understand.

31:42.828 --> 31:45.623
And what about next
week and the week after?

31:45.789 --> 31:47.583
This ain't gonna stop.

31:47.749 --> 31:49.293
There's nothing we can
do about this bastard.

31:49.459 --> 31:51.963
That's what you said in Boston.

31:52.129 --> 31:55.049
I thought you said we were
never to speak of that.

31:57.409 --> 32:00.221
I got us out of that,
I'll get us out of this.

32:01.813 --> 32:03.474
But how?

32:03.640 --> 32:05.592
I don't know yet.

32:05.717 --> 32:07.478
I'll figure somethin'.

32:09.312 --> 32:12.865
One day we'll send this to ma...

32:12.990 --> 32:17.059
And it'll be as thick as a brick.

32:19.197 --> 32:21.242
My hand to God.

32:43.430 --> 32:45.349
I had some 'jack rabbit' in me, too.

32:45.515 --> 32:49.095
Master gave me a nice pair
of bracelets to sleep in.

32:51.438 --> 32:53.232
Somebody put you in chains,

32:53.398 --> 32:55.526
the natural thing to
do is try to escape.

32:55.692 --> 32:57.303
Ain't I right?

33:06.360 --> 33:08.155
Ain't I right?

33:09.943 --> 33:11.353
Yeah.

33:11.478 --> 33:13.160
You're right.

33:16.496 --> 33:18.665
This way, let's go.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.542
They're comin'.

33:20.708 --> 33:22.377
You gonna make a run for it?

33:22.543 --> 33:25.088
I ain't leaving.

33:25.254 --> 33:26.423
They'll find you.

33:27.892 --> 33:30.127
Not where I'm going.

35:38.786 --> 35:40.162
So, it's true.

35:40.287 --> 35:41.830
Mm-hmm.

35:41.955 --> 35:43.866
All of them?

35:43.991 --> 35:47.147
Everyone but the woman.

35:47.313 --> 35:48.871
Them injuns get her?

35:48.996 --> 35:51.109
I don't know.

35:51.275 --> 35:52.708
Put the word out,

35:52.833 --> 35:56.178
$100 reward for anyone who finds her,

35:56.303 --> 36:00.744
but, uh...Not a word about the maps.

36:00.910 --> 36:02.576
Yeah.

36:29.522 --> 36:32.275
Mr. Durant?

36:34.041 --> 36:35.451
Who the hell are you?

36:35.576 --> 36:40.158
Cullen Bohannon...The man
they're looking to hang.

36:40.324 --> 36:42.424
For killing Johnson?

36:42.549 --> 36:45.330
I suppose you're here to
tell me you're innocent?

36:45.496 --> 36:46.661
No, sir.

36:46.786 --> 36:48.792
I'm here to ask for his job.

36:50.690 --> 36:53.797
How do you put your trousers on, son?

36:53.963 --> 36:55.423
Sir?

36:55.589 --> 36:58.260
Over those big balls of yours?

37:08.407 --> 37:12.774
2 minutes. That's all I ask.

37:27.246 --> 37:28.874
2 minutes.

37:34.300 --> 37:36.715
Did you fight in the war, Mr. Durant?

37:36.881 --> 37:40.051
I served my country in other ways.

37:40.217 --> 37:41.682
Oh.

37:41.807 --> 37:44.986
Building this railroad ain't
much different than the war.

37:45.111 --> 37:47.767
You got an army out there
and they need a leader.

37:47.933 --> 37:51.855
I take it you fought for
the South, Mr. Bohannon.

37:52.021 --> 37:54.227
Yes, sir.

37:54.352 --> 37:56.484
And that's exactly why
you need to hire me.

37:56.650 --> 37:59.905
You're going to have
to explain that to me.

38:00.071 --> 38:02.835
I can't remember a
time I wasn't outgunned,

38:02.954 --> 38:05.632
outmanned, or out supplied
fighting you Yankees.

38:05.757 --> 38:08.991
But I damn sure whooped your
asses more often than not.

38:09.157 --> 38:10.743
Is that so?

38:10.909 --> 38:13.707
Yes, sir. My men rode to hell
and back for me, Mr. Durant.

38:13.832 --> 38:17.333
That's why you need me out here.

38:18.937 --> 38:21.503
What do you know about
building railroads?

38:21.669 --> 38:22.984
Well, I had to learn
how they was built

38:23.109 --> 38:25.219
so I could figure out
bestow to blow them up.

38:25.344 --> 38:26.853
You remember the Baltimore

38:26.978 --> 38:29.256
and Ohio bridge over
the monacacy river?

38:29.381 --> 38:31.555
I built that bridge before the war.

38:33.786 --> 38:35.763
I blew the whole thing up

38:35.888 --> 38:39.396
using half a keg of black powder...

38:39.562 --> 38:42.435
But I'm done destroying
things, Mr. Durant.

38:42.560 --> 38:45.236
I want to help you
build this railroad.

38:49.168 --> 38:53.577
Why should I trust my
railroad to a gray back?

38:55.474 --> 38:58.720
You didn't have too much
trouble trusting gray backs

38:58.845 --> 39:00.651
when you was smuggling cotton out of

39:00.652 --> 39:02.457
Mississippi during
the war, now did ya?

39:02.582 --> 39:04.296
You walk a fine line, son.

39:04.462 --> 39:06.194
40 Miles, Mr. Durant.

39:06.319 --> 39:09.343
Ain't no secret you got to
lay 40 Miles of usable track

39:09.509 --> 39:11.799
before your government money kicks in.

39:11.924 --> 39:14.368
Now, you and I both know

39:14.493 --> 39:17.268
that you ain't gonna get
there going at this rate.

39:17.434 --> 39:20.896
You don't get that $16,000 a mile,

39:21.062 --> 39:23.568
this whole thing goes belly-up.

39:25.692 --> 39:28.445
You're fighting a war, Mr. Durant.

39:28.611 --> 39:30.485
No doubt about it.

39:30.610 --> 39:34.118
You need me to help you win it.

39:48.564 --> 39:50.009
Son of a bitch.

39:52.844 --> 39:54.680
What the hell are you doing, man?

39:54.846 --> 39:56.473
He's the son of a bitch
who killed Johnson.

39:56.639 --> 39:57.682
We gonna hang him.

39:57.807 --> 39:59.310
Nonsense.

40:00.643 --> 40:01.895
This is my new foreman.

40:04.147 --> 40:06.816
Find me someone else to hang.

40:42.850 --> 40:45.647
You're the new foreman?

40:45.813 --> 40:47.649
Yeah.

40:51.486 --> 40:53.864
Johnson's things still in there?

40:54.030 --> 40:55.138
Yes, sir.

40:55.263 --> 40:56.700
You want me to clear it out?

40:56.866 --> 40:58.160
Leave it.

40:59.701 --> 41:01.468
Yes, sir.
