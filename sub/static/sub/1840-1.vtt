00:06.850 --> 00:16.850
<b>(This Movie is Encoded By Doctor STAR -=!Dr.STAR!=-)</b>

02:16.000 --> 02:17.969
I haven't walked this path in years.

02:18.804 --> 02:21.406
This path never used
to feel this long to me.

02:22.107 --> 02:24.067
There are very few who
ever get to walk this path.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.617
Minister Cai, you're very early.

02:40.195 --> 02:41.496
I'm very sorry to have
troubled you, Prince.

02:41.699 --> 02:42.999
Rise, Lord An.

02:43.199 --> 02:45.195
I apologise for this great discourtesy.

02:46.570 --> 02:48.005
Thank you, your Highness.

02:48.205 --> 02:50.474
Your family has seen tragedy.

02:51.709 --> 02:53.511
An Shigeng committed a great crime,

02:53.711 --> 02:55.379
but he was killed by

02:55.581 --> 02:57.649
Department Six and the
Divine Constabulary,

02:57.816 --> 02:59.451
though his corpse was incomplete.

03:00.253 --> 03:01.788
His majesty knows Lord An

03:01.988 --> 03:03.890
helped the Imperial
Court on many occasions,

03:04.057 --> 03:05.759
and was a good, charitable man.

03:05.959 --> 03:07.928
I think we can treat
matters as finished for now.

03:08.696 --> 03:09.896
Isn't that right, Prince?

03:09.931 --> 03:12.562
As the Minister says, we
can put this in the past.

03:13.936 --> 03:15.616
I only came today to
report to His Majesty.

03:17.540 --> 03:19.064
Pleaase don't worry, Minister.

03:19.275 --> 03:21.244
And you too, Lord An.

03:21.612 --> 03:23.380
With both Department Six and

03:23.580 --> 03:25.349
the Divine Constabulary with us,

03:27.352 --> 03:29.354
I feel most at easy.

03:31.757 --> 03:35.460
I'll leave you to your work. Let's go.

03:41.201 --> 03:42.630
Minister Cai was chosen by
the Empress Dowager to help

03:42.730 --> 03:44.571
his Majesty take the throne.

03:44.739 --> 03:46.241
Challenhing his authority

03:46.441 --> 03:48.131
would be no easy task.

04:55.056 --> 04:57.625
Are other people just same as us?

05:03.599 --> 05:05.467
What?

05:09.306 --> 05:10.841
You have nothing to say?

05:18.250 --> 05:19.752
What do you mean?

05:24.624 --> 05:26.628
What do you want me to say?

05:39.542 --> 05:41.477
I think this is perfect.

05:44.047 --> 05:44.781
Mm.

05:50.522 --> 05:52.257
Iron Hands, look at this!

05:54.126 --> 05:55.926
You're a quick learner.

05:55.961 --> 05:57.802
I'd never think such a
small flick of the wrist

05:58.131 --> 05:59.291
could make such a difference.

05:59.432 --> 06:01.601
Can you teach me a
little more next time?

06:03.121 --> 06:04.621
Sure.

06:09.778 --> 06:12.314
That kung fu was incredible!

06:12.982 --> 06:16.051
It's called "Lightning
Bolt Eyes", and to women

06:16.520 --> 06:18.021
it comes naturally with practice.

06:19.823 --> 06:22.258
When he's here, you barely look at him.

06:22.294 --> 06:23.748
Then when he goes,

06:23.761 --> 06:25.825
and leaves you a letter,
you're still not happy.

06:25.997 --> 06:27.749
Women!

06:27.826 --> 06:29.201
That's really deep and powerful kung fu.

06:29.235 --> 06:31.750
Not really, we're not that deep.

06:31.827 --> 06:32.966
I just want to learn more

06:33.001 --> 06:34.106
from you, Life Snatcher.

06:34.142 --> 06:35.608
Really?

06:36.510 --> 06:38.328
Don't run! Dumpy's so
fast! Come on, doggie!

06:39.113 --> 06:40.748
The Divine Constabulary

06:41.415 --> 06:44.518
seems to abound with rare talents.

06:45.620 --> 06:47.830
How can ordinary people like me

06:47.990 --> 06:50.393
achieve such levels of skill?

06:52.396 --> 06:54.698
Some people are born
with a little talent,

06:54.733 --> 06:56.243
but that just means they start

06:56.400 --> 06:58.244
from a slightly higher position.

07:00.472 --> 07:02.359
You are a great master yourself, Liu,

07:02.541 --> 07:04.441
you're hardly ordinary.

07:04.476 --> 07:06.359
You're laughing at me, Zhengwo.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.583
When the court saw what
you were capable of,

07:10.851 --> 07:12.361
I was ashamed to show my face.

07:12.686 --> 07:13.952
What anazing feats?

07:13.988 --> 07:15.362
It is just that my heart
is clear and unimpeded,

07:15.456 --> 07:16.456
allowing me to perform

07:16.491 --> 07:19.160
the bagua movements a little faster.

07:19.196 --> 07:20.529
A clear heart?

07:21.797 --> 07:23.498
Don't underestimate
the power of the heart.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.651
A clear mind, no distractions,

07:25.686 --> 07:27.503
Truly perceiving, understanding.

07:27.771 --> 07:30.807
These can produce a force
of immeasurable power.

07:31.174 --> 07:33.410
And it begins with letting go.

07:39.785 --> 07:40.819
Letting go?

07:40.855 --> 07:42.188
Yes.

07:45.792 --> 07:48.260
It's like this cup.

07:48.295 --> 07:50.206
If you hold on to it, it will only

07:50.398 --> 07:52.667
ever be able to hold this much water.

07:55.370 --> 07:56.503
If you let it go,

07:56.538 --> 07:59.130
it can hold limitless amount of water.

07:59.208 --> 08:01.049
However much energy we
can create by ourselves,

08:01.131 --> 08:02.612
it will never

08:03.547 --> 08:05.632
approach that of nature.

08:06.083 --> 08:07.651
My power is not my own.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.633
It is borrowed.

08:11.055 --> 08:13.291
I thank you for your help, Zhengwo.

08:13.792 --> 08:15.494
You are too kind, Liu.

08:16.261 --> 08:17.963
Whichever school or discipline we study,

08:17.999 --> 08:19.666
we are all just developing our hearts.

08:20.299 --> 08:21.801
We all walk the same path.

08:21.837 --> 08:23.388
How far we travel

08:23.537 --> 08:25.388
depends only on ourselves.

08:27.508 --> 08:28.843
How are things?

08:29.677 --> 08:30.812
Very good.

08:33.515 --> 08:37.019
Department Six abolished titles
for the four top constables.

08:39.289 --> 08:40.491
Why?

08:44.262 --> 08:46.165
Haven't you heard?

08:46.264 --> 08:47.665
People in the city already have

08:47.832 --> 08:49.665
their own list of "The Four".

08:50.469 --> 08:53.305
Coldblood, Emotionless,
Iron Hands, Life Snatcher.

08:54.674 --> 08:56.969
If I choose my own "Four",

08:57.144 --> 08:59.470
I'd make fool of us.

09:02.817 --> 09:04.759
It's all right, though.

09:05.553 --> 09:07.255
Department Six is now

09:07.470 --> 09:09.191
more stable than ever,

09:09.558 --> 09:13.695
without the arrogance
we had in the past.

09:18.802 --> 09:20.404
The poison in your blood

09:20.578 --> 09:22.440
has not resurfaced?

09:22.475 --> 09:24.078
Not recently.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.579
It seems you've learned to
control the beast inside you,

09:26.745 --> 09:29.481
to control your emotions.

09:44.266 --> 09:47.312
I know how good

09:47.813 --> 09:50.740
that kind of redemption feels.

09:58.316 --> 10:01.186
But you must always remember:

10:01.954 --> 10:05.224
where there is light, there are shadows.

10:20.422 --> 10:21.422
Yaohua, you're here!

10:21.610 --> 10:22.943
You're finally here,

10:22.979 --> 10:24.419
I was worried you wouldn't get here.

10:24.423 --> 10:25.923
Right, we were so worried

10:27.151 --> 10:29.039
We came from 10 miles
away by fast horse.

10:29.153 --> 10:30.821
Anyway, we made it in time to meet you.

10:32.490 --> 10:33.725
It's getting foggy.

10:36.162 --> 10:37.730
How did it get so thick so fast?

10:40.333 --> 10:41.868
Where's Bell?

10:51.446 --> 10:52.803
Bell!

10:57.686 --> 10:59.321
Bell!

11:02.627 --> 11:05.329
Bell!

11:07.699 --> 11:08.199
Bell!

11:12.538 --> 11:14.540
Bell!

11:15.074 --> 11:16.342
Bell!

11:25.220 --> 11:26.922
Why did you run off like that?

11:27.122 --> 11:28.356
Finally, you're here!

11:28.391 --> 11:29.556
I was terrified

11:29.592 --> 11:31.211
Why did you run off like that?

11:31.227 --> 11:32.469
Because you ignored me!

11:32.504 --> 11:33.711
When did I ever ignore you?

11:33.730 --> 11:35.098
You always make things my fault!

11:35.212 --> 11:36.892
As long as you're okay.
Please don't fight!

11:37.033 --> 11:37.701
Let's go back!

11:37.712 --> 11:39.636
Are you okay?

11:39.837 --> 11:41.205
Wait a second!

11:52.452 --> 11:53.552
What is it?

11:53.587 --> 11:55.222
There's a strong smell of human blood.

13:03.670 --> 13:05.739
Oh, is this wrong?

13:05.906 --> 13:06.940
We shouldn't

13:07.113 --> 13:08.613
barge into a locked home.

13:09.114 --> 13:10.114
We're on a case.

13:10.344 --> 13:12.114
I think it must be deserted.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.115
Let's see what Coldblood says.

13:16.385 --> 13:18.149
What do you think?

13:38.077 --> 13:39.770
Are you okay?

13:40.447 --> 13:41.315
Rest for now.

13:41.365 --> 13:42.683
You've burned up almost

13:42.865 --> 13:44.365
all your qi.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.788
Iron Hands! There's
a live one over here!

14:34.878 --> 14:36.517
This man is Ouyang Da.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.017
There's been no trace of him for years.

14:39.651 --> 14:41.686
You recognize him, Zhengwo?

14:43.188 --> 14:44.790
The attacker used a powerful hand cannon

14:45.157 --> 14:46.568
that I've never heard of before.

14:46.626 --> 14:48.461
If he hadn't been wearing armour,

14:48.569 --> 14:50.517
he would have died immediately.

14:50.552 --> 14:52.465
I have a feeling about this case.

14:53.233 --> 14:54.435
Lord Liu,

14:54.802 --> 14:56.072
would you pass this case

14:56.104 --> 14:57.573
to the Divine Constabulary?

14:58.073 --> 14:59.107
Lord!

15:02.378 --> 15:04.312
If Zhengwo thinks he can solve it,

15:04.348 --> 15:06.248
then I think we can leave it to him.

15:06.748 --> 15:08.248
Thank you, Lord Liu.

15:08.384 --> 15:10.248
You little cockroach,
you're still alive?

15:10.888 --> 15:13.249
Are you alright, Coldblood?

15:13.792 --> 15:16.661
If we need help, Lord Liu,

15:17.280 --> 15:18.881
we'll be sure to call on Department Six.

15:28.509 --> 15:30.589
You're back again, Coldblood.
He hasn't woken up yet.

15:31.246 --> 15:32.280
Yes.

16:18.768 --> 16:21.504
[Department Six]

16:35.856 --> 16:37.472
The Ouyang Da case

16:37.624 --> 16:39.658
is almost certainly connected

16:39.694 --> 16:41.661
with some of our other current cases.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.473
How could you give it to
the Divine Constabulary?

16:43.498 --> 16:45.474
You're right. All the evidence suggests

16:45.600 --> 16:48.236
the attackers in theses
cases are the same.

16:48.804 --> 16:51.774
Let the Divine Constabulary
manage the Ouyang Da case.

16:51.942 --> 16:53.805
I never said we'd

16:53.977 --> 16:55.805
stop work on our other cases.

16:55.846 --> 16:59.805
Zhuge Zhengwo has a special
interest in this case.

17:00.318 --> 17:02.404
You suspect Zhuge Zhengwo, Lord?

17:02.440 --> 17:04.491
I wouldn't call it suspicion,

17:04.523 --> 17:06.725
I'm just interested in
knowing all the facts.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.161
Ji Yaohua,

17:10.197 --> 17:11.861
see if the Divine Constabulary

17:12.032 --> 17:13.861
needs any help,

17:13.968 --> 17:16.362
whether we need to be involved.

17:17.772 --> 17:19.106
Yes, sir.

17:19.574 --> 17:20.475
Jiang Lei,

17:21.009 --> 17:22.611
lead the investigation

17:22.644 --> 17:24.379
into these cases,

17:24.651 --> 17:26.151
including the Ouyang Da case.

17:26.315 --> 17:27.483
Keep everything quiet.

17:27.652 --> 17:29.152
Yes, sir.

17:42.435 --> 17:44.661
If the heart is clear,

17:45.137 --> 17:48.741
is everything possible?

18:15.173 --> 18:17.178
Zhengwo,

18:17.243 --> 18:19.645
I think... I understand now.

18:41.438 --> 18:43.040
You're so lucky!

18:43.140 --> 18:44.223
You received a present
from Iron Hands! No!

18:44.342 --> 18:45.724
Now knock it off!

18:45.943 --> 18:47.224
Give that stone back!

18:47.345 --> 18:48.724
You're still denying it!

18:48.881 --> 18:50.225
Give it back!

18:50.349 --> 18:51.725
You look so tense!

18:51.783 --> 18:53.952
Don't make a fuss.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.726
Why would anyone feel tense about
the men in the Divine Constabulary?

18:55.888 --> 18:57.226
Give it back!

18:57.391 --> 18:59.560
You've never received
a present from a man?

18:59.727 --> 19:01.227
What do you know about it?

19:02.445 --> 19:03.945
Have you?

19:04.445 --> 19:05.945
I will soon.

19:06.568 --> 19:09.022
Good. After Spring Festival,

19:10.022 --> 19:11.823
you should give up this
job and find husbands.

19:12.523 --> 19:14.023
Who wants a husband!

19:14.243 --> 19:15.845
Being a Department Six constable

19:16.024 --> 19:16.847
is lots more fun.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.783
What's wrong with being a normal woman?

19:19.819 --> 19:21.019
Detectives and constables

19:21.054 --> 19:22.952
under Ji Yaohua,

19:22.987 --> 19:24.025
much more impressive.

19:24.526 --> 19:25.526
Yeah!

19:25.724 --> 19:27.026
We even get our own bathhouse!

19:27.125 --> 19:27.991
It's really impressive!

19:28.026 --> 19:29.526
I'm just worried it's so impressive

19:29.529 --> 19:31.030
that no man will want you.

19:31.127 --> 19:33.327
If you don't marry, then
we won't marry either.

19:33.363 --> 19:35.528
Be careful, don't say
something you'll regret.

19:35.769 --> 19:37.337
Of course we won't.

19:37.529 --> 19:40.742
Think about it,
Department Six's Ji Yaohua

19:41.029 --> 19:43.645
has the eye of how many officials
and lords in the capital?

19:43.879 --> 19:45.530
Yes! Yes! The question is...

19:45.714 --> 19:47.514
will you marry one?

19:47.550 --> 19:49.290
Enough, I haven't thought about it.

19:49.325 --> 19:51.031
You really haven't thought about it?

19:51.222 --> 19:52.454
Stop bothering her!

19:52.489 --> 19:53.532
Come on, let's head back.

19:54.032 --> 19:55.332
Let's get to bed. Let's go.

20:24.361 --> 20:26.227
Why?

20:26.262 --> 20:31.490
I want to write the
rest of the story myself.

20:36.892 --> 20:40.846
Destiny leads us down paths long and
short and takes us to strange places.

20:41.648 --> 20:43.516
All you have to do is to recognize it.

20:44.217 --> 20:45.518
Enjoy your journey,

20:53.329 --> 20:54.897
bye.

23:52.842 --> 23:55.044
Don't be afraid!

24:08.393 --> 24:09.995
Take her to rest.

24:10.030 --> 24:11.785
Yes.

24:11.821 --> 24:13.542
Lord An,

24:13.566 --> 24:15.134
although the Divine
Conatabulary and Department Six

24:15.170 --> 24:17.036
are investigating carefully,

24:17.071 --> 24:19.306
they can only do so here in Peking.

24:19.474 --> 24:22.044
We are now distributing
counterfeit notes

24:22.053 --> 24:24.178
and coins around the whole country

24:24.214 --> 24:26.929
and popular unrest is rising.

24:26.964 --> 24:29.645
Please don't worry, Lord An.

24:30.986 --> 24:32.154
Don't worry?

24:32.655 --> 24:34.846
It's only because of your failings

24:35.047 --> 24:37.327
that my son is in this condition.

24:37.363 --> 24:38.962
Lord An!

24:38.997 --> 24:41.048
Lord An, please calm down.

24:41.199 --> 24:43.548
Your son was very lucky,

24:43.869 --> 24:46.049
and by superby grafting
him to Sun Sage Tree roots,

24:46.550 --> 24:49.042
you've granted him
life to a ripe old age.

24:49.050 --> 24:50.550
He has been most fortunate.

24:51.551 --> 24:53.051
It was heaven's will.

24:59.453 --> 25:00.454
Lord An,

25:00.555 --> 25:01.822
you'll be able

25:01.857 --> 25:03.103
to avenge your son soon.

25:03.292 --> 25:04.925
I will hold those in

25:04.961 --> 25:07.604
the Divine Constabulary to account.

25:09.699 --> 25:13.605
Do you think killing a few
people counts as revenge?

25:13.770 --> 25:14.006
Right.

25:14.205 --> 25:15.705
I want to make the King

25:15.740 --> 25:18.906
break his promise to heaven!

25:18.977 --> 25:20.107
Yes...

25:20.612 --> 25:23.107
I want to rule the country!

25:25.884 --> 25:29.776
You're lucky to be the Prime Minister,

25:31.325 --> 25:32.927
with that beggar's kneel.

25:33.243 --> 25:35.743
Yes, Lord An.

25:39.167 --> 25:39.874
Go.

25:46.976 --> 25:48.211
What is it?

25:48.311 --> 25:49.110
Lord An,

25:49.981 --> 25:52.111
Spring Festival is coming again

25:52.450 --> 25:54.611
and I haven't received

25:54.620 --> 25:57.112
my antidote this month.

26:12.742 --> 26:14.894
You're already vastly wealthy,

26:15.895 --> 26:18.395
why do you also need to rule?

26:18.430 --> 26:20.895
Hasn't everything I've done

26:21.396 --> 26:23.087
all been for you?

26:23.421 --> 26:25.102
For me?

26:25.423 --> 26:28.603
Or your idea of what you want me to be?

26:29.103 --> 26:31.103
Why don't you just take the throne?

26:32.698 --> 26:34.834
Actually I think my current situation

26:35.202 --> 26:37.605
is quite satisfactory.

26:38.071 --> 26:40.527
My mind is still working,

26:40.541 --> 26:44.028
I can think over
everything that happened.

26:45.881 --> 26:48.529
If only I could still see
the people from back then,

26:49.218 --> 26:52.353
it would be even better.

26:54.090 --> 26:56.645
But in my current condition

26:57.146 --> 26:59.646
you must warn everyone back home

26:59.797 --> 27:02.146
to protect against fire.

27:51.324 --> 27:52.816
Ouyang Da.

27:57.027 --> 27:59.250
You still couldn't let us get away?

28:05.241 --> 28:07.193
Stop!

28:13.985 --> 28:15.699
Help!

28:30.137 --> 28:31.439
Sheriff King.

28:32.006 --> 28:33.688
The injured man, Ouyang
Da, who was taken to

28:33.723 --> 28:35.371
the Divine Constabulary
has died suddenly.

28:35.510 --> 28:37.112
They say, when he
woke up, he went crazy,

28:37.147 --> 28:39.372
burned through all his qi, and died.

28:44.221 --> 28:47.182
What do you think that means?

28:49.293 --> 28:51.225
Maybe someone wanted to shut him up,

28:51.229 --> 28:53.725
they wanted the investigation stopped.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.726
Who would want him silenced?

28:56.401 --> 28:58.411
I can't read minds,

28:58.912 --> 29:00.412
I'm just guessing, but...

29:00.573 --> 29:02.912
Zhuge Zhengwo.

29:03.911 --> 29:07.723
Suspicion surrounding Zhuge
Zhengwo seems to be mounting.

29:08.516 --> 29:10.400
Continue the investigation.

29:10.901 --> 29:12.901
I'm going to have a word with Coldblood.

29:13.021 --> 29:15.457
You're not scared you'll give us away?

29:15.493 --> 29:17.326
It will be fine. Don't worry.

29:17.361 --> 29:18.402
I'll go.

29:18.828 --> 29:19.529
Yaohua,

29:22.900 --> 29:24.861
this Coldblood,

29:24.897 --> 29:26.823
I understand him.

29:27.071 --> 29:29.197
Once he makes a choice,

29:29.233 --> 29:31.324
he doesn't change his mind.

29:31.410 --> 29:34.346
When he joined the Divine Constabulary,

29:34.382 --> 29:36.603
I knew then he would never return.

29:36.638 --> 29:38.825
Do you understand what I'm saying?

29:41.923 --> 29:47.391
We can't always get the things we want

29:49.331 --> 29:52.134
I know what I can attain. Thank
you for your concern, Lord.

29:53.469 --> 29:56.456
I hope you don't mind my meddling.

29:56.957 --> 29:59.957
I don't! I'm just
sorry I make you worry.

29:59.993 --> 30:02.958
You've been in good
spirits recently, Lord.

30:03.214 --> 30:04.958
I think so, too.

30:06.485 --> 30:09.520
You can call me Lord Liu in the future,

30:09.556 --> 30:14.660
"Sheriff King" is a little
aggressive, a little cliche.

30:15.062 --> 30:16.961
Don't you think?

30:18.266 --> 30:20.462
Lord Liu.

30:42.828 --> 30:43.894
As soon as I went in,

30:43.929 --> 30:46.488
I saw Ouyang Da attacking him.

30:46.499 --> 30:47.989
That's why I acted,

30:48.001 --> 30:49.469
but I didn't mean to kill him!

30:49.490 --> 30:51.990
That's right! I was eating
at the time, I had just...

30:52.339 --> 30:53.572
Why would he want to kill?

30:53.608 --> 30:56.344
Zhengwo and I were doing
all we could to save him.

30:57.045 --> 30:59.991
Yes. I was eating at
the time, I, I, I...

31:00.492 --> 31:02.492
I was asking why he
attacked Zhuge Zhengwo!

31:03.953 --> 31:05.493
He was confused...

31:05.993 --> 31:07.493
I was just eating...

31:07.994 --> 31:10.494
Hey! Wait! I told you to wait!

31:10.529 --> 31:12.994
I can help you take it to him.

31:12.997 --> 31:13.995
No, we want to

31:14.165 --> 31:15.495
give it to Coldblood ourselves.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.735
Coldblood, we're here to
deliver some clothes for Dumpy.

31:18.003 --> 31:19.637
Okay, give them to me.

31:19.672 --> 31:21.496
Clothes for Dumpy? What about me?

31:21.508 --> 31:23.476
Life Snatcher, I'll go
back and make you some.

31:23.497 --> 31:25.712
Coldblood, Ji Yaohua would
like to talk to you alone.

31:25.998 --> 31:27.998
She's waiting for you
at Sun Yang Restaurant.

31:29.250 --> 31:30.999
He's so cute! Now Dumpy

31:31.019 --> 31:32.999
can join Department Six.

31:33.188 --> 31:35.999
He looks like a tortoise with that on.

31:57.050 --> 31:58.910
Coldblood is here.

32:07.596 --> 32:09.760
You're here.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.068
You wanted to see me about something?

32:12.103 --> 32:13.784
I need an excuse

32:13.803 --> 32:15.404
to invite you to drink tea?

32:15.785 --> 32:18.441
Please, have a seat.

32:22.079 --> 32:24.126
It's about the Ouyang Da case.

32:24.149 --> 32:25.627
I know the Divine Constabulary

32:25.650 --> 32:27.619
is running the case,

32:27.628 --> 32:30.356
but I have a few things
you might like to hear.

32:31.857 --> 32:33.861
Department Six wants to get involved?

32:38.366 --> 32:40.418
We're already involved

32:40.453 --> 32:42.435
including Ouyang Da,

32:42.471 --> 32:45.440
there have been three recent incidents
resulting in 11 innocent deaths.

32:45.448 --> 32:47.610
Many were killed by the same weapon.

32:48.077 --> 32:50.438
I don't think it's a coincidence.

32:50.447 --> 32:52.439
Three incidents?

32:59.157 --> 33:01.460
So what does Department
Six make of it all?

33:01.495 --> 33:04.462
We suspect a link to the murder

33:04.498 --> 33:06.699
of a family 12 years ago.

33:11.071 --> 33:13.181
Why do you think that?

33:13.941 --> 33:16.182
Because we can only
trace the background of

33:16.683 --> 33:18.183
some victims back 12 years

33:18.480 --> 33:20.682
That means they almost certainly

33:20.683 --> 33:23.084
used to go by other names.

33:23.386 --> 33:25.684
The murder of a family 12 years ago?

33:30.995 --> 33:33.209
Can you be more specific?

33:35.901 --> 33:39.405
The murder of the families of
eight officials 12 years ago.

33:39.572 --> 33:42.406
In total, 183 people were killed.

33:42.909 --> 33:44.643
The last family massacred

33:45.512 --> 33:48.644
was your family, the Sheng family.

33:49.350 --> 33:51.371
The gang of twelve who
killed the Sheng family

33:51.385 --> 33:53.871
were all killed that same
year by Zhuge Zhengwo.

33:54.289 --> 33:56.858
He also rescued you,

33:56.872 --> 33:58.372
Emotionless.

33:58.394 --> 34:00.873
But Lord Liu thinks

34:00.897 --> 34:03.266
Zhuge Zhengwo is hiding something.

34:03.433 --> 34:06.370
Some of the latest victims were probably

34:06.375 --> 34:07.972
members of the gang of twelve.

34:11.043 --> 34:13.050
You suspect this?

34:13.912 --> 34:15.714
It's just a possibility.
It's not like we have

34:15.729 --> 34:17.229
a name list of the gang of twelve.

34:19.953 --> 34:21.755
Are there any more "possibilities" that

34:21.790 --> 34:23.428
you'd like to tell us about?

34:25.960 --> 34:27.841
I knew Emotionless wouldn't

34:27.862 --> 34:29.841
take this information well,

34:30.165 --> 34:32.334
which was why I only invited Coldblood.

34:32.634 --> 34:34.169
But you came anyway,

34:34.343 --> 34:35.863
and it would be wrong not to tell you.

34:37.875 --> 34:40.510
Thank you. We're leaving.

34:41.478 --> 34:42.412
Goodbye.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.724
Didn't I say have him come alone?

34:52.736 --> 34:54.227
That's what I told him,

34:54.236 --> 34:55.736
but he insisted on bringing her.

34:59.132 --> 35:01.290
My father, Sheng Dingtian,
was a renowned scholar.

35:01.502 --> 35:04.037
Back then, he and other officials

35:04.072 --> 35:07.191
had evidence of Minister
Cai's corruption.

35:07.209 --> 35:08.792
They were ready to impeach him,

35:10.380 --> 35:12.509
but somehow news got out.

35:13.016 --> 35:15.660
The families of all the others

35:15.986 --> 35:18.161
were killed to silence them.

35:22.227 --> 35:24.776
My family was the last to be attacked.

35:27.534 --> 35:29.627
It was only because of Zhuge Zhengwo,

35:30.903 --> 35:32.864
who killed the gang of twelve,

35:33.240 --> 35:35.365
that I was saved.

35:45.155 --> 35:47.535
In one night,

35:49.360 --> 35:51.894
32 people lost their lives.

35:58.571 --> 36:01.055
And that night they ruined my legs.

36:08.616 --> 36:10.918
I never let my self remember

36:11.138 --> 36:12.720
because each time I think back,

36:12.756 --> 36:14.639
the pain is too much.

36:22.899 --> 36:25.135
So don't look back,

36:25.402 --> 36:27.012
leave it all in the past

36:27.404 --> 36:29.512
leave it all in the past.

36:36.048 --> 36:38.147
Zhengwo and I,

36:38.318 --> 36:39.918
and Iron Hands

36:39.953 --> 36:41.955
have lived together for 12 years.

36:42.255 --> 36:45.283
There is no one I
trust more than Zhengwo.

36:47.195 --> 36:50.031
I shouldn't listen to
those who speak against him.

37:13.859 --> 37:17.029
People are saying

37:18.632 --> 37:24.031
the gang of 12 who killed
the Sheng are still alive.

37:26.508 --> 37:29.044
12 years ago I personally
saw to the deaths of

37:29.080 --> 37:31.525
all who harmed your family.

37:33.517 --> 37:34.684
I know.

37:35.986 --> 37:37.220
Who's saying this?

37:46.299 --> 37:47.433
Ji Yaohua.

37:49.668 --> 37:52.538
Maybe she's trying to
cause a rift among us.

37:53.640 --> 37:56.678
Might it just be a misunderstanding?

37:58.145 --> 38:00.160
Uncle.

38:00.415 --> 38:02.661
Watch out for her.

38:28.181 --> 38:30.334
Apart from Gao Fu, whose
real name was Ouyang Da,

38:30.485 --> 38:32.118
here are Hu Xingyong,

38:32.153 --> 38:33.994
Guo Xiang Tian and Yang Cheng.

38:34.029 --> 38:35.835
They appeared to be merchants,

38:36.091 --> 38:37.858
but we suspect these three men

38:37.893 --> 38:39.836
were "the Iron Parasol" Zhang Xu'ao,

38:39.862 --> 38:41.849
"the Soul Collector" Dugu Wei,

38:41.884 --> 38:43.837
and "the Wanderer" Sun Bugong.

38:49.073 --> 38:51.177
Identical wounds,

38:52.143 --> 38:53.277
caused by identical weapons.

38:55.280 --> 38:58.695
Zhuge Zhengwo knew all of these people.

39:00.353 --> 39:02.788
They all

39:02.823 --> 39:05.341
disappeared 12 years ago.

39:06.661 --> 39:08.726
The exact time of

39:08.729 --> 39:10.726
the Sheng family massacre.

39:19.008 --> 39:21.143
Do you suspect Zhengwo?

39:23.647 --> 39:26.735
He himself said that he killed all

39:26.751 --> 39:29.236
12 of the original murderers.

39:29.521 --> 39:32.237
He made his name with that case.

39:32.257 --> 39:34.237
But why has he never made

39:34.260 --> 39:36.238
the names of the gang of 12 public?

39:38.365 --> 39:40.100
If these people really were

39:40.135 --> 39:41.800
members of the gang of 12,

39:41.836 --> 39:44.405
then Zhuge Zhengwo
never solved the case.

39:44.440 --> 39:46.941
Lord Liu.

39:49.945 --> 39:51.930
Lord Liu.

39:55.017 --> 39:57.819
If Zhuge Zhengwo really let

39:57.855 --> 40:00.857
the murderers of the
Sheng family go free,

40:00.893 --> 40:04.064
he may have been working with them.

40:07.366 --> 40:08.834
You're saying...

40:10.003 --> 40:12.405
Zhuge Zhengwo was part of the plot

40:12.440 --> 40:15.041
to kill Sheng Yayu's family?

40:15.077 --> 40:16.688
You don't believe it?

40:17.188 --> 40:18.688
It's hard to believe.

40:20.949 --> 40:23.528
But also hard not to believe.

40:23.619 --> 40:25.754
Everyone has secrets

40:25.789 --> 40:27.890
buried in their past.

40:28.524 --> 40:30.393
Sometimes they get dug up.

40:31.962 --> 40:34.226
Do you want to arrest him?

40:36.534 --> 40:38.101
Do we have any leads

40:38.136 --> 40:40.533
that take suspicion away from him?

40:51.552 --> 40:53.202
Sir,

40:54.189 --> 40:56.439
you have a thorough
knowledge of firearms.

41:01.864 --> 41:04.064
When I was young, the Imperial Arsenal

41:04.100 --> 41:06.354
created the Thunderbolt
Plough cannon for me.

41:06.502 --> 41:08.436
But it was too powerful,

41:08.472 --> 41:10.474
no one I used it on survived.

41:11.041 --> 41:12.562
I stopped using it years ago.

41:12.577 --> 41:14.063
Where is the Thunderbolt Plough?

41:14.078 --> 41:16.063
I returned to the court.

41:17.383 --> 41:19.393
That day by the mansion in the forest,

41:20.553 --> 41:23.323
it was you who attacked
me with the cannon.

41:25.992 --> 41:26.891
Me?

41:26.926 --> 41:28.897
Yes, you.

41:31.532 --> 41:33.590
You're sure? You aren't mistaken?

41:33.768 --> 41:36.091
I saw you with my own eyes.

41:40.809 --> 41:43.846
Then we have a very strange conundrum.

41:50.054 --> 41:53.724
Where were you at the
time of the attack?

41:54.560 --> 41:56.829
While you were all looking for Bell?

41:56.865 --> 41:59.085
I was just leaving Lord Liu.

41:59.099 --> 42:00.900
You didn't leave together?

42:01.086 --> 42:02.586
We went different directions.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.579
Okay.

42:12.381 --> 42:14.416
There's something else.

42:15.151 --> 42:18.639
12 years ago, when Yayu's
family was massacred,

42:18.889 --> 42:23.640
you said you killed
all those responsible.

42:25.930 --> 42:28.800
How could Ouyang Da still be alive?

42:35.307 --> 42:37.376
That...

42:39.813 --> 42:42.048
That I can't tell you.

42:44.752 --> 42:46.820
To dredge up the death of Yayu's family

42:46.856 --> 42:48.890
would do nobody any good.

42:50.025 --> 42:54.096
So, is Lord Liu investigating this case?

42:54.131 --> 42:56.234
I am.

43:01.772 --> 43:04.508
Give me two days, and
I'll solve the case.

43:05.844 --> 43:07.619
But during this time,

43:08.681 --> 43:10.881
can you promise me you won't

43:10.916 --> 43:13.081
discuss the case with anyone?

43:15.555 --> 43:17.297
Fine.

44:12.423 --> 44:14.482
It's been a long time.

44:19.799 --> 44:22.058
My fellow apprentice.

45:14.630 --> 45:16.684
Were you dreaming?

45:18.702 --> 45:20.769
Dreaming about me?

45:28.146 --> 45:30.048
Is this a dream?

45:30.515 --> 45:32.217
Whether it is, doesn't matter,

45:32.253 --> 45:33.920
you don't need to be afraid.

45:33.955 --> 45:35.887
I told my father

45:35.923 --> 45:39.368
I'm in charge of my own death,

45:39.960 --> 45:42.075
it has nothing to do with you.

45:42.463 --> 45:44.576
You really don't need to be afraid.

45:45.601 --> 45:48.254
Does your family still make furniture?

45:48.470 --> 45:51.254
Could you make me into a bed?

45:51.607 --> 45:53.755
Master.

45:54.111 --> 45:56.480
Don't be afraid.

45:57.214 --> 45:59.716
Don't be afraid.

46:34.592 --> 46:37.095
Very few people have earned
the right to drink this.

46:37.130 --> 46:38.888
you're going to take
over Department Six,

46:41.600 --> 46:46.038
wait patiently for your orders,

46:47.140 --> 46:50.875
drink.

46:50.911 --> 46:52.980
Thank you, Lord An.

47:01.124 --> 47:05.675
Don't worry, I will give
you antidote every month.

47:16.809 --> 47:19.556
The old man is driven crazy
by his love for his son

47:19.679 --> 47:22.148
The son is driven crazy
by his love for you.

47:22.448 --> 47:24.583
I'm not crazy.

47:25.920 --> 47:27.880
Yet you take orders from a crazy man?

47:28.123 --> 47:30.525
The orders I listen to are my own.

47:30.859 --> 47:34.996
But if it's to my advantage,

47:35.564 --> 47:37.733
I'll take orders from anyone.

47:49.114 --> 47:52.250
You have my advantages
at heart, don't you?

47:54.487 --> 47:56.478
I understand.

47:58.491 --> 48:00.869
You're a good fellow apprentice.

48:02.630 --> 48:04.597
You're like me.

48:04.633 --> 48:07.205
We're both clever women,

48:07.469 --> 48:10.705
and clever women never trust men,

48:10.940 --> 48:13.206
and never ever trust in love.

48:13.443 --> 48:17.207
Because that way, we achieve even more.

49:19.120 --> 49:21.423
Zhengwo.

49:22.959 --> 49:25.033
Sheriff King.

49:26.463 --> 49:29.791
What did you bring
me here to talk about?

49:30.902 --> 49:32.909
It's about me.

49:34.639 --> 49:36.167
You?

49:36.875 --> 49:38.977
You're investigating me, aren't you?

49:41.747 --> 49:43.681
So you know.

49:43.717 --> 49:45.780
I've already solved the case for you.

49:58.267 --> 50:01.096
The weapon you used
when you were younger,

50:01.405 --> 50:03.407
the Thunderbolt Plough.

50:03.540 --> 50:05.588
There's nothing I can hide
from you, Sheriff King.

50:05.610 --> 50:09.089
I thought you kept it
in the Imperial Archives.

50:09.815 --> 50:11.815
I haven't used it for a long time,

50:12.818 --> 50:15.247
but I've been thinking
of using it again.

50:35.411 --> 50:36.646
Zhengwo,

50:37.414 --> 50:39.349
my ability to read minds

50:39.359 --> 50:40.772
is getting weaker.

50:40.808 --> 50:42.398
That means you're

50:42.433 --> 50:43.953
getting more friends.

50:43.988 --> 50:45.488
The more people you care about,

50:45.524 --> 50:47.492
the less you'll be able to read minds.

50:47.527 --> 50:49.361
It's a good thing.

51:40.355 --> 51:42.291
A woodcutter saw Zhuge
Zhengwo that afternoon

51:42.326 --> 51:44.124
in the pavilion.

51:44.160 --> 51:46.062
The killer is Zhuge Zhengwo!

51:46.097 --> 51:47.716
What?

51:47.731 --> 51:49.717
When the Sheriff King left,

51:49.733 --> 51:51.401
he said he was meeting

51:51.436 --> 51:53.035
with Zhuge Zhengwo.

51:53.071 --> 51:55.681
That's right. We were
planning to go with him,

51:55.707 --> 51:56.941
but he said Zhuge Zhengwo

51:56.977 --> 51:58.042
was his friend.

51:58.077 --> 52:00.212
They must have wanted to
discuss something secret.

52:00.446 --> 52:02.182
That's why we didn't go with him.

52:02.282 --> 52:03.716
It wouldn't have made a difference.

52:03.751 --> 52:05.151
Against such a powerful opponent,

52:05.162 --> 52:07.184
you'd have lost your lives for nothing.

52:10.925 --> 52:12.476
Life Snatcher,

52:12.494 --> 52:14.260
we just came back from the arsenal.

52:14.296 --> 52:15.977
There used to be two
of these cannons there.

52:15.998 --> 52:17.237
Was this the murder weapon?

52:17.272 --> 52:18.477
This is the only one left.

52:18.500 --> 52:20.200
It's called the Thunderbolt Plough.

52:20.236 --> 52:22.038
Zhuge Zhengwo used to
be responsible for it

52:22.073 --> 52:24.025
as the King's chief bodyguard.

52:24.061 --> 52:25.979
Lord Liu has been looking for it.

52:26.543 --> 52:27.843
We should go

52:27.879 --> 52:29.047
arrest Zhuge Zhengwo.

52:29.082 --> 52:29.964
Wait!

52:29.981 --> 52:32.317
You're protecting the
Divine Constabulary.

52:34.186 --> 52:35.988
Do you know who'll be

52:36.023 --> 52:37.755
most upset by this?

52:37.791 --> 52:40.231
The Divine Constabulary's Coldblood

52:40.260 --> 52:42.731
Lord Liu adopted him and raised him.

52:42.796 --> 52:44.732
Even his name, Leng
Lingqi, came from Lord Liu.

52:44.767 --> 52:46.232
Do you understand?

52:50.806 --> 52:52.508
Hey! Don't move the body!

53:41.866 --> 53:45.219
Zhuge Zhengwo!

53:45.255 --> 53:48.539
He is not here.

53:48.575 --> 53:51.009
Come out! Zhuge Zhengwo

53:51.077 --> 53:53.009
Come out!

53:53.914 --> 53:55.916
Hey, are you crazy?

53:56.183 --> 53:58.319
We know something's
happened to the Sheriff King.

53:58.355 --> 53:59.722
Mr. Zhuge has asked Duke Westgate

53:59.731 --> 54:01.222
to investigate the scene.

54:01.223 --> 54:03.222
He wanted us to wait for
you so we could go together

54:03.225 --> 54:04.860
Why do we need to look for clues?

54:04.895 --> 54:06.862
Zhuge Zhengwo killed him!

54:07.030 --> 54:08.532
That's not possible.

54:08.567 --> 54:10.224
We have proof.

54:12.036 --> 54:12.765
Coldblood!

54:12.770 --> 54:14.070
Who's this Duke Westgate?

54:14.105 --> 54:15.538
He now goes by the name Zhang Yiwan

54:15.574 --> 54:17.375
Zhang Yiwan from the
Bulging Pockets Casino?

54:17.410 --> 54:19.077
Another assumed name...

54:19.112 --> 54:20.766
Let's go together.

54:26.052 --> 54:27.686
Duke Westgate,

54:27.721 --> 54:30.357
you won't need your weapons for this.

54:30.625 --> 54:33.527
So you killed the Sheriff King,
and now you're here for me?

54:34.930 --> 54:36.296
You're wrong.

54:36.331 --> 54:38.567
I don't think I am.

54:38.572 --> 54:40.369
Back then, when I agreed
to kill the Sheng family,

54:40.404 --> 54:42.638
I knew I was taking a gamble.

54:42.706 --> 54:45.073
I never imagined I would kill them

54:45.709 --> 54:48.612
and yet still somehow lose the bet.

54:49.480 --> 54:51.715
I'm really so unlucky.

54:52.684 --> 54:55.821
I finally managed to
settle down and enjoy life,

54:57.523 --> 54:59.558
but you won't even let me have that

54:59.593 --> 55:01.532
I didn't want to kill you.

55:01.561 --> 55:04.197
You earned your reputation on our backs.

55:04.899 --> 55:06.968
I can understand you'd be willing

55:07.003 --> 55:09.003
to kill us to silence us.

55:16.712 --> 55:19.007
Helpers are here.

55:22.954 --> 55:24.575
Coldblood, don't attack him yet!

55:24.589 --> 55:26.575
You hypocrite!

55:34.000 --> 55:36.175
You're all that's left of
the miserable Sheng family?

55:36.180 --> 55:37.671
Zhuge Zhengwo killed us

55:37.676 --> 55:39.176
to help you take revenge?

55:39.182 --> 55:40.495
Are you the man who killed my family?

55:40.531 --> 55:41.809
And I regret only breaking your legs!

55:41.844 --> 55:43.811
We should have killed you!

57:19.125 --> 57:21.461
You'd attacked a suspect
before you questioned him!

57:21.482 --> 57:23.482
Are you constables or assassins?

57:47.158 --> 57:49.459
- Yayu.
- What are you doing?

57:49.494 --> 57:51.606
- Why are you helping him?
- I trust him.

57:53.065 --> 57:55.138
Why is he still alive?

57:56.036 --> 57:58.111
What else are you lying to me about?

57:59.907 --> 58:01.977
Where are the other killers?

58:09.652 --> 58:11.719
Zhang Yiwan informed us that

58:11.754 --> 58:13.789
Zhugo Zhengwo had asked to see him.

58:13.825 --> 58:16.755
He said Zhugo Zhengwo

58:17.256 --> 58:20.130
wanted to kill him to silence him.

58:20.231 --> 58:22.256
It's just a shame we arrived too late.

58:22.267 --> 58:25.257
I came to get the truth
about the Lord Liu's murder,

58:26.705 --> 58:29.208
but it seems Miss Ji has
reached her conclusion.

58:29.243 --> 58:31.189
Even if I don't arrest you,

58:31.211 --> 58:34.190
do you think the rest of
my people will let you go?

58:34.347 --> 58:37.717
He is the man who murdered Lord Liu.

58:39.770 --> 58:40.444
No way!

58:40.454 --> 58:41.890
Iron Hands, we don't
want any more trouble.

58:42.057 --> 58:44.187
Report this to the Prince right away.

58:44.560 --> 58:46.688
Miss Ji, I'll go with you.

58:48.698 --> 58:50.565
Emotionless,

58:50.600 --> 58:51.700
you killed that man,

58:51.735 --> 58:53.737
so you come with us, too.

59:02.380 --> 59:05.094
Lord! We found something.

59:12.325 --> 59:13.966
We found these in the
Sheriff King's belt.

59:18.299 --> 59:19.331
They're poisoned.

59:19.366 --> 59:23.103
Poison? Those aren't the Sheriff King's.

59:23.614 --> 59:25.114
He never used poison.

59:25.141 --> 59:26.615
Find out where they come from.

59:26.675 --> 59:28.615
Yes.

59:42.061 --> 59:44.480
Congratulations, Yaohua.

59:44.515 --> 59:46.864
The Sheriff King is dead.

59:46.900 --> 59:48.741
And soon you'll be in
charge of Department Six.

59:52.206 --> 59:54.508
You should leave here
as soon as possible.

59:54.543 --> 59:56.397
I'm not joking.

59:56.411 --> 59:58.398
And what about you?

1:00:03.352 --> 1:00:05.907
I don't have any other choice.

1:00:06.857 --> 1:00:09.125
Yaohua, I want to stay with you.

1:00:14.733 --> 1:00:19.271
Butterfly once told me the same thing,

1:00:21.173 --> 1:00:24.163
and she ended up

1:00:25.145 --> 1:00:27.164
dying in my arms.

1:00:27.381 --> 1:00:29.417
I don't want that happening to you.

1:00:43.133 --> 1:00:45.895
Don't worry, Yaohua.

1:00:45.931 --> 1:00:48.659
We'll all be fine.

1:01:01.054 --> 1:01:03.857
You're very good to them.

1:01:03.893 --> 1:01:06.160
And I admire that!

1:01:13.202 --> 1:01:15.421
Lord An doesn't trust you,

1:01:15.438 --> 1:01:17.773
he wanted me to test your loyalty.

1:01:18.075 --> 1:01:20.342
Don't worry, Miss Ji.

1:01:20.344 --> 1:01:22.842
I know exactly what to tell him.

1:01:31.691 --> 1:01:33.057
Haven't Zhuge Zhengwo and

1:01:33.092 --> 1:01:34.625
the rest already been locked up?

1:01:34.661 --> 1:01:36.496
He couldn't have
killed the Sheriff King!

1:01:36.531 --> 1:01:37.973
Don't say that.

1:01:37.998 --> 1:01:40.473
Our plans have changed, understand?

1:01:48.077 --> 1:01:50.862
Mr. Zhuge, I'm sorry.

1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:52.362
For security reasons,

1:01:52.382 --> 1:01:54.863
I have no choice but to keep
you in Iron Blood Prison.

1:03:30.112 --> 1:03:31.790
Emotionless' qi is so strong

1:03:31.826 --> 1:03:33.298
that we have to use neddles

1:03:33.333 --> 1:03:34.852
on her acupuncture points

1:03:34.888 --> 1:03:36.338
to prevent her using it.

1:03:36.373 --> 1:03:38.374
There's no other way.
I'm sorry about this.

1:04:18.889 --> 1:04:23.343
Shigeng, the man who did this to
you is locked in Iron Blood Prison.

1:04:39.748 --> 1:04:41.893
Sir, Aunt Poise is here to see you.

1:04:49.059 --> 1:04:51.224
You're here.

1:04:52.096 --> 1:04:54.145
We really must thank Miss Ji.

1:04:54.932 --> 1:04:57.968
I should thank her for
putting you in here?

1:04:58.004 --> 1:05:01.066
Did she really need to lock you up?

1:05:02.942 --> 1:05:04.998
People like me

1:05:05.011 --> 1:05:07.499
have to be locked up like this.

1:05:09.784 --> 1:05:13.422
Why did you never talk
about these things before?

1:05:20.363 --> 1:05:22.698
Some things are better not to know.

1:05:24.434 --> 1:05:27.081
How many secrets are
you still hiding from me?

1:05:28.339 --> 1:05:31.455
Anything concerning you personally,
I've never kept hidden from you.

1:05:35.113 --> 1:05:37.415
What about things concerning Yayu?

1:05:42.756 --> 1:05:44.257
I can't tell you!

1:05:44.357 --> 1:05:45.642
Why can't you?

1:05:45.678 --> 1:05:46.893
I just can't.

1:05:46.928 --> 1:05:50.131
Did you kill the Sheriff
King and those others?

1:05:51.867 --> 1:05:53.266
I didn't kill them.

1:05:53.301 --> 1:05:55.837
Then why don't you tell everybody?

1:05:59.843 --> 1:06:01.888
I'm still hoping I'm wrong in

1:06:01.912 --> 1:06:03.888
my suspicion of who the real killer is.

1:06:03.915 --> 1:06:05.889
Who are you trying to protect?

1:06:05.917 --> 1:06:07.483
I can't tell you!

1:06:07.519 --> 1:06:09.390
There're some things
that I can't change,

1:06:09.421 --> 1:06:11.390
I just have to face them.

1:06:12.391 --> 1:06:13.770
I'm waiting.

1:06:13.793 --> 1:06:15.770
You're just waiting for death.

1:06:22.136 --> 1:06:24.064
Yayu...

1:06:59.047 --> 1:07:01.082
Can't you say something?

1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:06.832
Even just swear at me?

1:07:11.195 --> 1:07:12.646
I didn't want to hide from you what

1:07:12.681 --> 1:07:14.062
was happening with Zhuge Zhengwo,

1:07:14.097 --> 1:07:16.099
there were just too many
things I didn't know.

1:07:17.268 --> 1:07:19.355
I understand he's very important to you

1:07:20.072 --> 1:07:22.107
and he's just as important to me.

1:07:24.110 --> 1:07:26.107
But the Sheriff King's death

1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:30.607
proves he's not the
person we thought he was.

1:07:32.387 --> 1:07:34.487
He was hiding too many secrets.

1:07:36.324 --> 1:07:37.824
Coldblood,

1:07:37.826 --> 1:07:39.928
your time is up. You need to go.

1:07:59.319 --> 1:08:01.538
Zhuge Zhengwo is a prisoner

1:08:01.721 --> 1:08:04.324
and we won't see any more trouble
from the Divine Constabulary.

1:08:04.360 --> 1:08:07.539
Lord An's triumph is at hand.

1:08:09.364 --> 1:08:11.170
The next step

1:08:15.471 --> 1:08:17.549
is up to you.

1:08:18.241 --> 1:08:20.810
I await your orders, Lord An.

1:08:21.511 --> 1:08:25.015
Kill Emotionless!

1:08:27.285 --> 1:08:29.878
Such a trifling little girl?

1:08:29.888 --> 1:08:32.378
It's because she's just
a trifling little girl

1:08:32.825 --> 1:08:35.527
that the King can't show her mercy.

1:08:35.829 --> 1:08:37.796
It could create trouble in the future.

1:08:37.831 --> 1:08:41.701
It could lead to the whole
court losing faith in him.

1:08:42.102 --> 1:08:46.440
Yes, but I'm going to kill someone.

1:08:47.075 --> 1:08:49.172
I need a reason.

1:08:49.178 --> 1:08:51.747
You're a corrupt minister,

1:08:52.849 --> 1:08:54.984
I'm sure you have ways.

1:08:58.122 --> 1:08:59.256
Yes.

1:09:01.292 --> 1:09:03.055
Come back.

1:09:03.795 --> 1:09:06.180
When we meet in the future,

1:09:06.216 --> 1:09:08.567
we'll meet somewhere else.

1:09:08.834 --> 1:09:11.133
If he's seen with you too often,

1:09:11.137 --> 1:09:14.134
it could damage the
An family's reputation.

1:09:16.177 --> 1:09:18.189
Yes.

1:09:22.283 --> 1:09:25.753
Without me, you'd all be nothing!

1:09:34.465 --> 1:09:36.232
This is so heavy!

1:09:37.201 --> 1:09:39.754
You're useless! Let me do it.

1:09:39.771 --> 1:09:41.755
No, I can't move it.

1:09:42.174 --> 1:09:43.756
It's too heavy! It's too heavy!

1:09:43.943 --> 1:09:45.444
You should just forget about it.

1:09:45.479 --> 1:09:47.256
Yes, yes! Forget about it.

1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:48.560
Stop that! [Divine Constabulary]

1:09:48.757 --> 1:09:50.507
What are you doing?

1:09:50.542 --> 1:09:52.257
I am... just...

1:09:52.420 --> 1:09:54.955
Is this still the Divine Constabulary?

1:09:55.457 --> 1:09:57.726
The Divine Constabulary helps people!

1:09:58.426 --> 1:10:00.978
You handle the hardest cases

1:10:01.014 --> 1:10:03.532
and stop the worst criminals.

1:10:04.166 --> 1:10:05.787
Divine Constabulary people

1:10:05.802 --> 1:10:07.288
have been framed and imprisoned,

1:10:07.470 --> 1:10:10.288
and you just wait here doing nothing!

1:10:10.308 --> 1:10:12.410
The case has already been solved.

1:10:12.445 --> 1:10:14.512
Mr. Zhuge didn't kill anyone!

1:10:14.846 --> 1:10:18.374
Coldblood, you have no right to speak.

1:10:18.384 --> 1:10:20.375
You were scheming against the
Divine Constabulary from the start.

1:10:20.753 --> 1:10:22.321
You've already arrested Mr. Zhuge,

1:10:22.357 --> 1:10:24.322
so your task is finished.

1:10:24.491 --> 1:10:26.822
Zhuge Zhengwo killed the Sheriff King.

1:10:26.827 --> 1:10:28.527
Did Ji Yaohua tell you that?

1:10:28.562 --> 1:10:30.564
You actually believe
what she tells you?!

1:10:32.234 --> 1:10:34.067
Yayu was arrested too,

1:10:34.102 --> 1:10:35.403
so now you can go
back to Department Six.

1:10:35.438 --> 1:10:36.955
and be with your Ji Yaohua.

1:10:36.991 --> 1:10:38.439
What are you still doing here?

1:10:38.474 --> 1:10:39.847
I can burn the Divine
Constabulary sigh myself!

1:10:39.942 --> 1:10:41.847
I won't wait for Department
Six to tear it down.

1:10:42.212 --> 1:10:45.286
It's true there are many
questions Zhengwo needs to answer.

1:10:45.583 --> 1:10:47.618
So why don't you check things out?

1:10:47.752 --> 1:10:49.353
What kind of colleagues are you?

1:10:49.389 --> 1:10:50.956
What kind of friends are you?

1:10:50.991 --> 1:10:52.255
Aunt Poise,

1:10:52.290 --> 1:10:54.790
there's no use talking
to people like him.

1:10:54.861 --> 1:11:00.798
He's convinced Zhengwo
is the killer. He...

1:11:02.436 --> 1:11:05.303
Big Wolf, Bell, come and help me.

1:11:05.339 --> 1:11:07.642
I don't have time to
talk to people like him.

1:11:07.676 --> 1:11:11.024
He was never really one of us!

1:11:16.319 --> 1:11:17.486
Aunt Poise,

1:11:17.488 --> 1:11:19.453
it's not as bad as it seems.

1:11:19.488 --> 1:11:21.257
Maybe Coldblood will go with us to
examine around the stone tablets.

1:11:21.293 --> 1:11:22.989
Okay?

1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:24.989
Okay.

1:11:59.971 --> 1:12:01.939
Between the Sheriff
King and Zhuge Zhengwo,

1:12:01.975 --> 1:12:03.942
who was a better fighter?

1:12:05.478 --> 1:12:07.807
They were about the same.

1:12:08.848 --> 1:12:11.117
I'd say Zhuge Zhengwo
was a little better.

1:12:12.152 --> 1:12:14.521
But why would he need to
use the Thunderbolt Plough?

1:12:17.291 --> 1:12:19.421
That's his most powerful weapon.

1:12:22.197 --> 1:12:24.290
Was he afraid of losing?

1:12:24.867 --> 1:12:27.069
Was he even afraid of losing

1:12:27.070 --> 1:12:29.069
to Ouyang Da and the others?

1:12:32.977 --> 1:12:34.969
He used his most powerful weapon

1:12:35.113 --> 1:12:37.469
and failed to hit him the first time.

1:12:37.483 --> 1:12:40.470
The second time he fired, the
Sheriff King was already down.

1:12:40.486 --> 1:12:42.287
That seems like overkill.

1:12:42.471 --> 1:12:44.290
You can shoot someone lying down.

1:12:44.824 --> 1:12:46.848
That's not Zhengwo's style.

1:12:46.860 --> 1:12:48.427
I agree it doesn't seem like him.

1:12:48.462 --> 1:12:50.330
But someone said they saw him that day.

1:12:50.350 --> 1:12:51.850
How can we explain that?

1:12:59.509 --> 1:13:01.865
Is there anything else
that looks suspicious?

1:13:03.313 --> 1:13:05.380
Department Six said they found

1:13:05.416 --> 1:13:08.022
3 strange needles on
the Sheriff King's body.

1:13:10.121 --> 1:13:11.912
Strange needles?!

1:13:14.526 --> 1:13:17.463
You said that Zhuge Zhengwo was
acting like a totally different person.

1:13:17.499 --> 1:13:19.065
If he wasn't acting
like a different person,

1:13:19.069 --> 1:13:20.266
he wouldn't have
killed the Sheriff King.

1:13:20.301 --> 1:13:22.268
Could it have been an imposter?

1:13:22.503 --> 1:13:24.655
Are you looking for
excuses or for evidence?

1:13:24.690 --> 1:13:26.807
You were quick to
decide he was the killer

1:13:26.843 --> 1:13:28.810
and you won't consider anything else.

1:13:42.893 --> 1:13:45.528
Do you remember that day I was injured?

1:13:47.598 --> 1:13:50.017
He was the one that fired
the weapon that did it.

1:13:50.168 --> 1:13:53.338
Zhuge Zhengwo, I saw
him with my own eyes.

1:13:53.539 --> 1:13:55.007
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

1:13:55.042 --> 1:13:56.066
He told me to wait,

1:13:56.075 --> 1:13:57.775
he said he would explain everything.

1:13:57.811 --> 1:14:00.567
I believed him. I waited, I
waited, I kept on waiting...

1:14:00.580 --> 1:14:02.900
If I hadn't, perhaps the Sheriff
King would still be alive.

1:14:04.085 --> 1:14:06.554
Where is the Sheriff King's sword?

1:14:08.189 --> 1:14:09.124
What sword?

1:14:09.224 --> 1:14:10.605
Someone used a sword here.

1:14:25.010 --> 1:14:27.361
This must have been made by a sword.

1:14:28.047 --> 1:14:30.182
The Sheriff King didn't carry a sword.

1:14:30.218 --> 1:14:32.362
And Zhuge has never used one.

1:14:33.254 --> 1:14:35.055
The sword and the poisioned needles

1:14:35.090 --> 1:14:37.024
must belong to the killer.

1:14:49.104 --> 1:14:50.013
I knew it.

1:14:51.007 --> 1:14:53.176
You're not Zhuge Zhengwo.

1:15:24.346 --> 1:15:27.749
Was all this a part of your plan?

1:15:27.751 --> 1:15:29.750
This can't be just about

1:15:29.753 --> 1:15:31.750
framing Zhuge Zhengwo!

1:15:31.756 --> 1:15:34.751
You don't get to know the truth.

1:16:32.894 --> 1:16:34.996
I know there are doubts about this case,

1:16:35.464 --> 1:16:37.269
but we need the Prince to report

1:16:37.300 --> 1:16:39.269
to the King before it is settled.

1:16:39.302 --> 1:16:41.270
You don't trust Coldblood?

1:16:41.338 --> 1:16:43.406
This has nothing to do with trust.

1:16:43.442 --> 1:16:45.271
This is a question of duty.

1:16:45.676 --> 1:16:46.771
And if the Prince doesn't meet the King,

1:16:46.777 --> 1:16:48.843
they'll stay locked

1:16:48.879 --> 1:16:50.881
in there forever, right?

1:16:52.051 --> 1:16:53.017
Your Highness!

1:16:53.052 --> 1:16:55.302
The Prince is here.

1:16:56.122 --> 1:16:57.990
Your Highness!

1:16:59.292 --> 1:17:01.928
Miss Ji, these are His
Majesty's private orders.

1:17:01.964 --> 1:17:04.073
Please receive them.

1:17:04.532 --> 1:17:06.901
Your Highness, Zhuge Zhengwo...

1:17:06.937 --> 1:17:08.179
Don't worry,

1:17:08.637 --> 1:17:10.839
I'll deal with everything here.

1:17:11.140 --> 1:17:13.180
Go back to Divine Constabulary
and wait for orders.

1:17:14.544 --> 1:17:17.630
Firefly, Cicada, show
them the way out. Yes.

1:17:18.130 --> 1:17:19.630
Your Highness.

1:17:21.252 --> 1:17:22.186
Miss Ji!

1:17:23.087 --> 1:17:25.111
We'll be leaving then.

1:17:28.094 --> 1:17:30.128
You don't need to worry this time.

1:17:30.163 --> 1:17:33.613
Yes, the Prince will deal with
everything. I'm not worried at all.

1:17:33.649 --> 1:17:36.369
Hey! I took this. Do you want
to see those private orders?

1:17:43.011 --> 1:17:44.278
Your Highness,

1:17:44.313 --> 1:17:47.182
you want to move straight to
punishment without a trial?

1:18:07.206 --> 1:18:08.590
Your Highness.

1:18:09.109 --> 1:18:10.591
Miss Ji.

1:18:11.378 --> 1:18:12.010
Yes.

1:18:12.045 --> 1:18:14.591
In some matters the court

1:18:14.615 --> 1:18:16.592
finds it expedient to give orders

1:18:16.617 --> 1:18:18.684
and expect obedience.

1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:20.756
You don't need to be a part of this,

1:18:20.956 --> 1:18:23.167
I'll deal with everything.

1:18:29.833 --> 1:18:31.517
Sheng Yayu,

1:18:33.271 --> 1:18:35.573
I have the King's orders

1:18:36.075 --> 1:18:38.176
for your execution.

1:18:42.982 --> 1:18:44.883
Open the door.

1:18:48.523 --> 1:18:50.753
Who are you?

1:18:50.758 --> 1:18:52.753
You saw through it!

1:18:56.465 --> 1:18:58.867
There orders came from
Minister Cai, not the King.

1:18:59.636 --> 1:19:01.686
I made these leg
support crutches for you.

1:19:03.107 --> 1:19:04.821
Come with me.

1:19:13.452 --> 1:19:15.323
Go. This way.

1:19:16.890 --> 1:19:18.926
You'll get into
trouble. Get out of here.

1:19:18.930 --> 1:19:20.391
It's like a maze in here,

1:19:20.427 --> 1:19:22.427
you'll never get out. Come with me.

1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:26.877
Let's go.

1:19:29.304 --> 1:19:33.166
You need to be sure of how
you're going to kill Emotionless.

1:19:47.459 --> 1:19:49.628
Where are the guards?

1:19:52.532 --> 1:19:54.601
Sheng Yayu escaped her cel!

1:19:54.636 --> 1:19:56.468
Get her now!

1:19:56.504 --> 1:19:58.832
You. Go check on Zhuge Zhengwo!

1:19:58.839 --> 1:20:00.332
Come with me.

1:20:00.342 --> 1:20:01.833
Come on!

1:20:01.843 --> 1:20:03.333
Let's go!

1:20:27.440 --> 1:20:28.740
How does this work?

1:20:28.775 --> 1:20:30.735
You've never seen this
before. It's serious stuff.

1:20:30.745 --> 1:20:32.612
Catch.

1:20:47.330 --> 1:20:48.648
Run!

1:20:48.683 --> 1:20:50.325
What?

1:20:50.361 --> 1:20:51.969
Run!

1:21:11.993 --> 1:21:13.197
Hey!

1:21:25.743 --> 1:21:27.994
Go!

1:21:47.300 --> 1:21:47.568
Life Snatcher!

1:21:47.645 --> 1:21:49.438
Be careful, Ding Dong!

1:21:50.806 --> 1:21:52.603
Life Snatcher!

1:22:06.091 --> 1:22:07.572
Are you okay?

1:22:07.592 --> 1:22:10.072
- Help me look for them.
- Okay! Let's go!

1:22:18.638 --> 1:22:20.427
Sir, it's this way.

1:22:21.442 --> 1:22:22.993
You find Mr. Zhuge.

1:22:23.028 --> 1:22:24.545
I'll look for Yayu.

1:22:24.563 --> 1:22:25.563
Okay.

1:22:34.090 --> 1:22:35.043
Stop!

1:22:39.629 --> 1:22:40.898
Don't run!

1:22:41.433 --> 1:22:43.700
So, a jailbreak?!

1:22:43.702 --> 1:22:45.200
I'm sorry.

1:23:40.837 --> 1:23:42.437
Yayu?

1:23:42.472 --> 1:23:43.700
The Prince?

1:23:43.706 --> 1:23:45.700
Did you kill her?

1:23:51.115 --> 1:23:53.351
Emotionless is fine.

1:23:53.619 --> 1:23:55.795
Iron Hands rescued her.

1:24:02.996 --> 1:24:05.084
The Prince is an imposter,

1:24:05.532 --> 1:24:08.168
someone who knows how to shapeshift.

1:24:12.574 --> 1:24:14.910
That must be the one who
killed the Sheriff King.

1:24:17.013 --> 1:24:18.981
They're probably also part of

1:24:19.016 --> 1:24:20.950
the plot to rescue Emotionless.

1:24:20.986 --> 1:24:22.648
No way.

1:24:24.456 --> 1:24:25.990
I don't care.

1:24:26.017 --> 1:24:28.493
No one can escape this place.

1:24:28.517 --> 1:24:30.059
Please tell Emotionless, from me,

1:24:30.095 --> 1:24:33.518
escaping jail is a capital crime!
The same goes for those who save her.

1:24:37.905 --> 1:24:39.373
Firefly!

1:24:41.041 --> 1:24:43.202
Where have you been?

1:26:02.738 --> 1:26:05.007
It's a woman

1:26:10.781 --> 1:26:12.715
Zhuge Zhengwo is just up there.

1:26:12.751 --> 1:26:14.853
- I'll go and distract them.
- Okay.

1:26:18.557 --> 1:26:20.860
What are you looking at? Go and patrol!

1:26:20.865 --> 1:26:22.562
Okay. Go!

1:27:27.874 --> 1:27:30.076
You've got some nerve!

1:27:44.793 --> 1:27:48.195
My friend, I don't want to hurt you.

1:28:07.586 --> 1:28:09.414
Still want to fight?

1:28:23.406 --> 1:28:25.207
Sir, the Prince is
carrying secret orders

1:28:25.242 --> 1:28:27.009
from His Majesty to execute Emotionless.

1:28:28.744 --> 1:28:30.932
Are you all right, sir?

1:28:32.850 --> 1:28:34.404
What kind of locks are these?

1:28:34.419 --> 1:28:35.887
They're mechanical locks.

1:28:35.905 --> 1:28:37.625
Once the alarm sounds,
they can't be opened.

1:28:38.189 --> 1:28:39.088
Ridiculous!

1:28:39.123 --> 1:28:40.891
There's no such thing as a
lock that can't be opened.

1:28:40.906 --> 1:28:42.561
Get out of the way.

1:28:47.033 --> 1:28:48.552
Can you pull the needles in Zhengwo's

1:28:48.569 --> 1:28:50.753
acupuncture points
from outside the door?

1:28:51.004 --> 1:28:53.321
Do I look like Emotionless?

1:28:55.042 --> 1:28:57.201
I'll give it a try.

1:29:08.692 --> 1:29:10.827
No, it's way too hard...

1:29:13.064 --> 1:29:14.937
What are you doing?

1:29:14.942 --> 1:29:17.437
Help me! Lend me some qi!

1:29:18.437 --> 1:29:20.266
Move it!

1:29:20.273 --> 1:29:21.741
Come on!

1:29:21.767 --> 1:29:23.443
I'll count one two three...

1:29:23.478 --> 1:29:25.767
One! Two! Three!

1:29:42.733 --> 1:29:45.736
Got it! How many more are there?

1:29:46.069 --> 1:29:48.222
36.

1:29:54.613 --> 1:29:56.682
Get out of my way.

1:30:46.709 --> 1:30:48.811
Why is your face so dirty?

1:31:58.461 --> 1:31:59.688
Let's go!

1:31:59.723 --> 1:32:00.880
Don't run!

1:32:00.915 --> 1:32:02.915
Get them! Stop right there!

1:32:11.476 --> 1:32:13.636
Who are you?

1:32:25.893 --> 1:32:27.243
It's a woman?

1:32:27.595 --> 1:32:29.757
- What's going on?
- How can it be?

1:33:29.735 --> 1:33:31.737
She's the one who
killed the Sheriff King.

1:33:32.005 --> 1:33:33.705
Get her!

1:33:33.707 --> 1:33:35.705
- Yes!
- Don't move!

1:33:36.110 --> 1:33:38.493
The Divine Constabulary has
come to break them out of jail.

1:33:38.513 --> 1:33:40.493
Arrest all of them!

1:33:41.016 --> 1:33:42.651
- Emotionless!
- Yayu.

1:33:43.452 --> 1:33:44.719
Iron Hands told me,

1:33:44.755 --> 1:33:47.657
only someone with a lot
of qi can ignite the fuse.

1:33:48.592 --> 1:33:49.935
Get back!

1:33:50.435 --> 1:33:52.435
Further!

1:33:53.498 --> 1:33:55.486
Pah!

1:34:01.139 --> 1:34:02.603
Pah!

1:34:04.177 --> 1:34:06.546
Bell, did you put the fuse in right?

1:34:17.226 --> 1:34:18.918
Let's go.

1:34:19.418 --> 1:34:20.918
Wait, put this on.

1:34:25.102 --> 1:34:26.436
Go!

1:34:26.466 --> 1:34:27.966
Come on, let's go!

1:35:06.651 --> 1:35:08.512
Go! What are you doing?

1:35:28.544 --> 1:35:30.454
If you decide to run,

1:35:30.479 --> 1:35:32.966
it's not just a crime you're committing.

1:35:33.002 --> 1:35:35.455
They'll disband the Divine Constabulary.

1:35:35.953 --> 1:35:37.219
Emotionless,

1:35:37.254 --> 1:35:39.705
are you that cruel?

1:35:39.957 --> 1:35:41.705
Yayu.

1:35:42.961 --> 1:35:44.894
The Prince is an imposter!

1:35:44.930 --> 1:35:47.167
His Majesty will surely set you free.

1:35:47.266 --> 1:35:48.966
Don't try to break out of jail.

1:35:49.001 --> 1:35:50.667
I'm the daughter of Sheng Dingtian,

1:35:50.670 --> 1:35:52.668
the sister of Sheng Yanshi,

1:35:52.672 --> 1:35:54.668
don't you understand?

1:35:56.243 --> 1:35:58.347
I need to take my revenge.

1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:01.828
There are people out
there I still need to kill!

1:36:18.036 --> 1:36:23.894
You'll get the death
penalty. Don't go! I'm sorry.

1:36:25.245 --> 1:36:27.181
Let's go now!

1:36:45.368 --> 1:36:47.519
How did we end up back here?

1:36:48.172 --> 1:36:51.051
I arranged everyone to meet here.

1:37:10.966 --> 1:37:12.971
Why did you choose this place?

1:37:13.068 --> 1:37:14.971
When will they get here?

1:37:25.983 --> 1:37:27.271
Yayu,

1:37:27.284 --> 1:37:31.271
do you really mean you don't
remember this place at all?

1:38:44.677 --> 1:38:46.943
Slow down, slow down.

1:38:46.946 --> 1:38:48.179
Be careful!

1:38:48.214 --> 1:38:49.943
This little girl... really!

1:38:52.987 --> 1:38:54.975
- Yayu! Come here.
- Mom.

1:38:54.989 --> 1:38:56.475
Come here!

1:38:56.975 --> 1:38:58.475
Don't run!

1:38:58.493 --> 1:39:00.476
Mom, why are we hiding?

1:39:00.495 --> 1:39:01.976
Hiding?

1:39:02.632 --> 1:39:04.477
You silly girl,

1:39:04.500 --> 1:39:06.477
we're not hiding.

1:39:06.503 --> 1:39:07.971
You said you were bored

1:39:07.978 --> 1:39:09.478
just staying at home all day.

1:39:09.573 --> 1:39:11.375
That's why we took you out to play.

1:39:11.411 --> 1:39:12.977
You're not happy?

1:39:12.979 --> 1:39:14.479
Yes.

1:39:14.912 --> 1:39:17.515
And I'll have more time with you.

1:39:19.418 --> 1:39:22.788
We'll go play in the hills
and the water. It'll be fun!

1:39:22.824 --> 1:39:25.060
Where do you want to play?

1:40:27.933 --> 1:40:29.299
- Xiuyi!
- Mom!

1:40:29.334 --> 1:40:33.191
Dingtian, did you betray those people?

1:40:33.206 --> 1:40:35.192
I did nothing wrong!

1:40:35.208 --> 1:40:37.192
I have nothing to be ashamed of!

1:42:16.362 --> 1:42:20.699
The 12 men who killed your
family were Tombstone Sima,

1:42:21.134 --> 1:42:22.836
Duke Westgate,

1:42:23.370 --> 1:42:25.038
Blood Phoenix,

1:42:25.606 --> 1:42:28.042
Wusheng East, Wusheng West,

1:42:28.410 --> 1:42:31.227
Zhang Xu'ao, Dugu Wei,

1:42:31.813 --> 1:42:35.893
Sun Bugong, Moji Sansan,

1:42:36.452 --> 1:42:38.625
and Ouyang Da.

1:42:39.823 --> 1:42:43.126
The final member was Kong Balang.

1:42:44.695 --> 1:42:48.873
Later he changed his name to Tie Youxia.

1:42:50.469 --> 1:42:52.138
I...

1:42:56.843 --> 1:42:59.345
was one of the twelve.

1:43:13.997 --> 1:43:16.326
What are you talking about?

1:43:17.201 --> 1:43:19.604
Everything has been a
great misunderstanding.

1:43:20.037 --> 1:43:21.952
After Lord Liu died,

1:43:21.974 --> 1:43:23.713
Zhuge reported all that
had happened to His Majesty,

1:43:23.748 --> 1:43:25.453
he couldn't have killed
someone at the same time.

1:43:25.477 --> 1:43:26.953
The person who killed Lord Liu

1:43:26.979 --> 1:43:28.454
must be that woman you caught.

1:43:28.614 --> 1:43:30.454
I have already reported to His Majesty.

1:43:30.549 --> 1:43:33.454
He has pardoned everyone
for any crime committed

1:43:33.553 --> 1:43:35.722
and restored the Divine
Constabulary to their posts.

1:43:36.724 --> 1:43:38.624
All cases related to this,

1:43:38.659 --> 1:43:39.980
except for the death of Lord Liu,

1:43:39.997 --> 1:43:41.895
will be dropped.

1:43:41.930 --> 1:43:44.870
Miss Sheng, you are
no longer a criminal.

1:43:46.002 --> 1:43:48.970
Some of the gang of 12 are still alive?

1:43:49.206 --> 1:43:50.598
Destroy them all.

1:43:51.341 --> 1:43:53.459
Don't leave a single one alive.

1:43:53.644 --> 1:43:55.446
She's Sheng Dingtian's daughter,

1:43:55.460 --> 1:43:56.960
why are you protecting her?

1:43:57.983 --> 1:44:00.004
Hey! The girl is innocent.

1:44:14.034 --> 1:44:15.673
Don't touch her!

1:44:23.045 --> 1:44:26.214
You didn't kill them?

1:44:27.150 --> 1:44:30.387
Things aren't quite as they appear.

1:44:36.261 --> 1:44:39.099
They killed 32 members of my family,

1:44:44.471 --> 1:44:47.601
and you didn't help me take revenge?

1:44:53.715 --> 1:44:55.711
Yayu!

1:45:02.326 --> 1:45:04.879
You've loved me since I was little.

1:45:06.281 --> 1:45:08.281
You always indulged me,

1:45:13.272 --> 1:45:15.877
was that because you were ashamed?

1:45:17.810 --> 1:45:19.779
All 32 members of my family!

1:45:22.249 --> 1:45:24.047
Who did you kill?

1:45:24.786 --> 1:45:26.854
Tell me!

1:45:29.958 --> 1:45:30.891
Yayu!

1:45:30.926 --> 1:45:33.401
And there's you!

1:45:33.863 --> 1:45:36.265
I took the decision back then.

1:45:36.301 --> 1:45:37.589
Prince...

1:45:40.772 --> 1:45:43.455
The truth is brutal,

1:45:43.741 --> 1:45:45.665
but she will never let this go

1:45:45.701 --> 1:45:47.591
unless she's told the truth.

1:45:48.247 --> 1:45:52.938
12 years ago, there were
eight honest officials.

1:45:53.152 --> 1:45:57.439
They were ready to impreach
the corrupt Minister Cai.

1:45:58.125 --> 1:46:00.503
One of them leaked the news.

1:46:00.995 --> 1:46:02.954
He not only failed to present

1:46:02.990 --> 1:46:04.915
the evidence to His Majesty,

1:46:05.067 --> 1:46:07.915
but also tipped off Minister Cai.

1:46:08.271 --> 1:46:10.039
In one night,

1:46:10.740 --> 1:46:14.416
183 people from 7
families were assassinated.

1:46:15.245 --> 1:46:18.763
Only one family was left unharmed.

1:46:20.418 --> 1:46:22.162
Your father's,

1:46:23.122 --> 1:46:25.855
the scholar Sheng Dingtian's family.

1:46:28.828 --> 1:46:31.632
The identity of the traitor was obvious.

1:46:32.433 --> 1:46:35.035
Could we let the deaths of 183 people

1:46:35.054 --> 1:46:36.554
go unpunished?

1:46:36.838 --> 1:46:39.307
Iron Hands' entire family was killed.

1:46:40.009 --> 1:46:42.212
Was he wrong to take revenge?

1:46:50.054 --> 1:46:52.167
My father was a loyal official.

1:46:56.996 --> 1:47:00.253
You told me my father
was killed by traitors.

1:47:01.268 --> 1:47:03.203
You told me.

1:47:07.141 --> 1:47:09.377
Or you were lying to me?

1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:14.762
Didn't you tell me
you'd never lie to me?

1:47:23.794 --> 1:47:26.001
And my mother?

1:47:27.098 --> 1:47:29.031
My little brother?

1:47:37.177 --> 1:47:41.015
Were all 32 members of my family...

1:47:43.017 --> 1:47:45.719
traitors?

1:47:45.854 --> 1:47:47.720
It was wrong to kill your family.

1:47:48.220 --> 1:47:51.220
The King regretted it
and sent me to prevent it.

1:47:51.721 --> 1:47:54.221
But it was already too late.

1:47:54.730 --> 1:47:56.538
That's what really happened.

1:47:56.900 --> 1:47:58.917
It was our great King who,

1:47:59.270 --> 1:48:01.906
when he learned that
Iron Hands saved you,

1:48:01.941 --> 1:48:03.678
gave him a pardon.

1:48:03.713 --> 1:48:05.416
He also pardoned you.

1:48:16.857 --> 1:48:19.769
How wonderfully gracious of His Majesty!

1:48:30.205 --> 1:48:31.840
Don't!

1:48:33.443 --> 1:48:36.182
I knew this moment
would come eventually.

1:48:36.914 --> 1:48:39.625
I always wanted to tell you the truth,

1:48:39.818 --> 1:48:42.126
but the time was never right.

1:48:49.929 --> 1:48:51.064
Don't come closer!

1:48:51.364 --> 1:48:54.681
Yayu, calm down.

1:48:56.570 --> 1:48:58.973
You're not afraid of me?

1:48:59.073 --> 1:49:00.308
I'm Sheng Dingtian's daughter!

1:49:00.708 --> 1:49:02.074
What does that matter?

1:49:02.912 --> 1:49:05.091
You're just the same as them,

1:49:06.415 --> 1:49:08.520
you've all been lying to me.

1:49:11.322 --> 1:49:13.489
Or are you, like them,

1:49:14.292 --> 1:49:16.578
doing everything just for me!

1:49:25.104 --> 1:49:27.367
Whether you thank them
or take revenge on them,

1:49:27.467 --> 1:49:29.467
I'll stand with you!

1:49:30.243 --> 1:49:32.398
I'll just say this to you:

1:49:32.898 --> 1:49:37.398
Iron Hands was the man
who saved your life.

1:50:22.906 --> 1:50:25.988
You couldn't kill Minister Cai,

1:50:26.410 --> 1:50:28.989
but you could kill my whole family.

1:50:39.892 --> 1:50:42.242
If I'm innocent,

1:50:47.935 --> 1:50:50.124
then I'd ask you to let me go, sir.

1:51:09.795 --> 1:51:12.620
Thank you for all the
kindness you've shown me.

1:51:24.379 --> 1:51:26.126
I beg you,

1:51:29.384 --> 1:51:31.411
don't follow me.

1:52:49.779 --> 1:52:52.864
You got what you wanted
and still not happy?

1:52:56.522 --> 1:53:01.526
I'm not sure why, but
I don't feel so happy.

1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:11.963
It seems getting what we want
and happiness aren't so related.

1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:31.963
