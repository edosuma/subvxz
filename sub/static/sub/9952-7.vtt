00:00.960 --> 00:02.541
Previously on Haven...

00:02.920 --> 00:04.456
-Duke Crocker.
-This is Evi.

00:04.589 --> 00:05.920
I'm Duke's wife.

00:06.257 --> 00:08.373
Somebody out there with a tattoo
wants to kill me.

00:08.718 --> 00:11.755
I’m hoping that whatever/ ﬁnd buried here
will give me the answers

00:11.888 --> 00:13.424
about how / stay alive.

00:15.224 --> 00:17.215
Doesn't exactly look like something
that's gonna save my life.

00:17.310 --> 00:18.390
What is it?

00:18.603 --> 00:20.969
-"Omnia vincit amor. "
-"Love conquers all."

00:25.610 --> 00:28.443
The good people of this community
need to know what happened here.

00:28.571 --> 00:30.277
The last thing Haven needs

00:30.406 --> 00:33.648
is the Rev and his self-righteous poison
running things.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.111
He wants to be chief?

00:35.244 --> 00:36.654
He wants to control whoever is.

00:36.829 --> 00:39.741
Nathan, your father
chose to live among the cursed.

00:40.291 --> 00:43.124
-Seek forgiveness.
-I can help you.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.626
-You help a lot of people.
-|s that why I'm here?

00:45.755 --> 00:46.790
AUDREY: / can talk to them.

00:46.923 --> 00:49.335
You're troubled, like many
of the people in Haven.

00:49.467 --> 00:50.798
And I can help them.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.635
-You can't save everyone.
-But that's why I'm here.

00:54.764 --> 00:56.880
-I need to know more about her.
-Lucy Ripley.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.305
What do you think, she your mother?

00:58.976 --> 01:00.307
I am Lucy.

01:05.983 --> 01:08.770
BOYS: # Cold and dark below the foam

01:08.861 --> 01:12.274
# They wait for us, but never alone

01:12.698 --> 01:16.236
# The sea is dark, the sea is deep

01:16.327 --> 01:19.740
# Down below is where they sleep

01:19.830 --> 01:22.697
# Cold and dark below the foam

01:22.917 --> 01:26.580
# They wait for us, but never alone #

01:29.257 --> 01:32.966
Let me go! Stop! I don't want to! Please!

01:38.182 --> 01:39.388
No!

01:48.067 --> 01:52.026
# The sea is dark, the sea is deep

01:52.363 --> 01:55.901
# Down below is where they sleep

01:56.033 --> 01:59.742
# Cold and dark, below the foam

01:59.870 --> 02:02.737
# They wait for us, but never... #

02:07.211 --> 02:08.792
Supper's ready.

02:39.994 --> 02:42.986
Lucassi said he found the body
on the beach early this morning.

02:47.752 --> 02:48.992
Lucassi?

02:49.462 --> 02:50.577
Nathan.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.081
What you got?

02:52.173 --> 02:54.334
Came out to do some clamming.

02:54.592 --> 02:55.581
Found this instead.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.923
I already got a liver temp.

03:01.140 --> 03:03.347
-He's been dead about 10 hours.
-Who is he?

03:03.601 --> 03:05.683
I don't know.
I was about to check for some ID.

03:06.145 --> 03:07.430
Nathan.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.386
Well, we've seen that before.

03:09.482 --> 03:10.597
There's no wallet.

03:11.275 --> 03:12.435
Just this.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.106
He had a wife, maybe?

03:17.281 --> 03:18.521
Yeah, or a girlfriend.

03:18.616 --> 03:20.652
Either way, someone who can ID him.

03:21.869 --> 03:22.949
I got something else.

03:23.788 --> 03:24.948
This handwritten note.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.237
Not much left.

03:26.332 --> 03:32.828
"I'm sorry to leave you like this.
I know it will hurt, but I can't go on."

03:33.339 --> 03:34.499
Suicide note.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.297
Wouldn't be the first guy around here
to go for a one-way swim.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.302
Maybe this woman can tell us why.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.643
I heard you pulled a body
out of the water near Benny's Cove.

03:50.523 --> 03:52.639
What, are you worried
he left an open bar tab?

03:52.858 --> 03:53.973
No.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.184
Actually, I'm more concerned
about the tattoo he had on him.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.652
How did you know he had a tattoo?

04:00.533 --> 04:01.818
Truce!

04:03.828 --> 04:04.988
Do you know him?

04:07.832 --> 04:09.538
No. Who is he?

04:09.834 --> 04:11.665
lfl knew, then I wouldn't have asked you.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.788
-Nobody recognizes him?
-Nope.

04:13.879 --> 04:17.167
Nathan, I need to know
who this guy is, okay?

04:17.258 --> 04:18.964
What if he's the guy
who's supposed to kill me?

04:19.051 --> 04:22.589
Duke, if I find out anything pertinent
relating to your imminent demise,

04:22.680 --> 04:24.341
then lwill let you know.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.969
I found out the woman
in the keychain photo is Mary Collins.

04:27.059 --> 04:30.017
I guess she runs the soup kitchen
at Reverend Driscoll's church.

04:30.354 --> 04:31.685
Reverend Driscoll's involved?

04:32.356 --> 04:34.347
-Out, now.
-Okay.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.891
And stay out of this or you're gonna be
asking your cell mate

04:37.027 --> 04:38.688
what he knows about tattoos.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.229
You hear that? What do you think of that?

04:48.914 --> 04:51.906
Leith's been on edge
the past few weeks, but I can't believe...

04:52.126 --> 04:53.241
You sure it's him?

04:53.419 --> 04:54.454
Uh-huh.

04:54.753 --> 04:57.130
We found the body this morning.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.046
Leith had a rather unusual tattoo.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.499
Family thing.

05:01.594 --> 05:03.630
Notjust Leith,
a lot of the Glendowers have it.

05:03.888 --> 05:06.254
Did Leith give you any idea
what may have been bothering him?

05:06.599 --> 05:08.385
Why he'd commit suicide?

05:08.476 --> 05:09.716
Money.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.550
He knew things were tight for us.

05:11.896 --> 05:13.682
I mean, even though
we weren't together any more,

05:13.772 --> 05:15.899
he tried to give me money for me and Daniel.

05:16.525 --> 05:17.605
Our son.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.600
He's only 10.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.026
How do I tell him that his father's dead?

05:25.534 --> 05:28.241
The Glendowers live in a compound
beyond the outskirts of town.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.906
There's no paved roads in or out.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.741
A lot of people are afraid to even go there.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.742
You make it sound like
Leith's family's some kind of cult.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.793
A lot of people around here think they are.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.923
My dad would drive out there,
check on them every once in a while.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.376
I even went with him
a few times when l was a kid.

05:45.721 --> 05:49.088
-Are they troubled?
-My dad never said anything.

05:49.475 --> 05:51.090
Not that he would.

05:52.061 --> 05:54.598
The school said Leith
didn't drop Daniel off at school.

05:54.772 --> 05:57.309
I tried calling Daniel's cell phone,
but he wasn't picking up.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.395
You don't think that Leith
took Daniel and they're both dead?

06:00.486 --> 06:02.101
Okay, when was the last time
that you saw Daniel?

06:02.279 --> 06:03.314
Yesterday.

06:03.447 --> 06:06.439
Leith dropped him off
at his family's place for the night.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.361
Daniel likes hanging out with his cousins.

06:08.452 --> 06:11.159
He's been going back and forth
until Leith and I can settle custody.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.324
I need you to stay at home
in case he turns up there.

06:13.666 --> 06:14.951
Listen, don't worry.

06:15.584 --> 06:16.960
We're gonna find him.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.807
It's not what I expected.

06:38.357 --> 06:39.893
Back when I would visit with my dad,

06:39.984 --> 06:42.145
there were always tons of kids
my age running around.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.025
Well, maybe they're in school.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.316
No, they were all home-schooled.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.648
| always thought that was kind of cool.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.150
Maybe Daniel feels the same way.

06:51.787 --> 06:52.822
Nathan.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.830
-|t's been a long time.
-Cole.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.835
We were sorry to hear about your father.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.202
This is Officer Parker.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.873
This is Gwen and Cole Glendower.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.211
It's nice to meet you.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.639
Why are you here?

07:15.227 --> 07:17.684
We found Leith on a beach outside town.

07:18.147 --> 07:20.684
He's dead. I'm sorry.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.061
Looks like suicide.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.146
Suicide?

07:25.863 --> 07:27.228
Are you sure?

07:27.364 --> 07:29.025
We found this on him.

07:29.158 --> 07:30.523
Can you tell me anything about it?

07:34.038 --> 07:35.153
No.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.200
Mary said Daniel was here.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.914
We've come to take him home.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.211
Daniel's place is with us,

07:45.341 --> 07:47.252
now that his father's died.

07:47.426 --> 07:48.882
We'll tell the poor boy what happened.

07:49.053 --> 07:50.589
That's up to his mother.

07:50.763 --> 07:52.594
No, Mary can't take care of Daniel.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.679
That's why we were trying to get custody.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.598
We? I thought that was Leith.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.891
Leith was a Glendower.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.844
Where's Daniel?

08:01.398 --> 08:04.731
And for that matter,
where are any of the children?

08:04.902 --> 08:06.563
I thought you home-schooled, right?

08:08.238 --> 08:11.571
I'm not gonna ask again, Cole.
Where's Daniel?

08:13.410 --> 08:15.401
We're not answering any more questions.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.618
Your father was a friend to us,
but it's time for you both to leave.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.242
Either you give us Daniel, or I'll get a warrant.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.704
And we'll have officers crawling
over every inch of this place.

08:26.924 --> 08:30.587
Well, you make sure you have
that warrant next time | see you here.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.359
We're looking for Daniel. Is he here?

08:51.073 --> 08:52.108
You can't have him.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.279
Daniel is one of us now.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.791
Let's get it together, guys.

10:08.609 --> 10:11.692
Reverend Driscoll is helping me.
We're going to get Daniel back.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.269
I thought I told you to wait at home.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.355
I couldn't just sit there.
The Glendowers do have Daniel.

10:17.326 --> 10:18.611
Look what he texted me.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.535
He sent it with a message,
saying that he wants to live with them

10:21.663 --> 10:23.039
and the other boys now.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.201
Those people have brainwashed my son.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.835
You shouldn't have involved
Reverend Driscoll.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.871
He's helping me get my son back.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.632
No one is going out to the Glendowers.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.798
You are trying to protect
the scum of the earth.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.217
What do you think you know
about the Glendowers?

10:41.391 --> 10:42.972
I know they're the kind of filth
that should have been

10:43.060 --> 10:45.301
cleansed from this town years ago.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.349
Mary.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.975
-You don't wanna do this.
-I want my son.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.651
You know how they feel about outsiders.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.899
Storming over there
with a lynch mob isn't the way.

10:57.199 --> 10:59.485
I know you don't get along
with Leith's family,

10:59.576 --> 11:01.362
but they're Daniel's family, too.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.070
He's gonna need them with his dad gone.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.247
They started this.

11:08.377 --> 11:11.084
Well, I'm sure they're upset about Leith, too.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.841
Let's do this the smart way.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.767
Pack it up.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.689
Mary wants you all to go home.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.395
All right, guys.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.228
We're not gonna wait forever, Nathan!

11:37.614 --> 11:40.276
That boy's soul is at stake.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.775
I'll call you when l have him.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.127
We need to find Daniel.

11:51.253 --> 11:54.370
The Rev and his men are this close
to going all Mad Max on the Glendowers.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.129
I think I know why he's interested.

11:56.425 --> 11:58.416
I found a case in 1983.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.046
A woman went missing. Penny Driscoll.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.802
The Rev's wife.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.555
The suspect in the case,
your dad's prime suspect,

12:05.642 --> 12:07.348
Cole Glendower.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.259
Why did the chief think Cole was involved?

12:09.479 --> 12:11.856
The report doesn't say.
But then three days later,

12:12.357 --> 12:14.518
she was killed in a car accident.

12:14.776 --> 12:18.234
The Rev thought it was murder,
and your dad didn't pursue it.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.688
If the Rev thinks Cole's responsible
for his wife's death,

12:20.782 --> 12:23.114
that would explain why
he's looking for a fight.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.535
If we don't find Daniel, he's gonna turn
that compound into a battleground.

12:26.914 --> 12:30.498
Then I say you and | go out there tonight
and we take an unofficial look.

12:30.709 --> 12:33.041
Lastlchecked,
breaking and entering was a felony.

12:33.337 --> 12:36.079
And last I checked, The Troubles
weren't covered in the police manual.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.462
Look,l”

12:37.591 --> 12:40.048
I wanna do something, but I'm the chief now.
| can'tjust...

12:40.135 --> 12:42.046
If the Glendowers are troubled,

12:42.387 --> 12:45.470
like most of the people we've met,
they might not even know about it.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.430
And if something happens to Daniel,

12:47.559 --> 12:50.801
something happens to those other children,
and we could have stopped it?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.095
We'll never forgive ourselves.

12:53.315 --> 12:56.273
If I say no, you're gonna go
out there anyway, aren't you?

12:56.818 --> 13:00.151
Come on. I bet you look good in black.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.036
Let's go.

13:18.173 --> 13:19.913
This one's locked.

13:21.385 --> 13:22.625
Okay.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.256
Picking and entering. Wow, that's better.

13:25.514 --> 13:28.506
Hey, none of the other houses
we searched were even locked.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.592
There's gotta be a reason this one is.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.220
Hopefully, Daniel is in here somewhere.

14:21.278 --> 14:22.438
What'd you find?

14:24.489 --> 14:28.402
The reason Cole and Gwen
freaked out when they saw me.

14:30.245 --> 14:31.951
They knew Lucy Ripley?

14:34.499 --> 14:35.534
This man here?

14:36.877 --> 14:37.957
That's my dad.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.126
Chief knew Lucy?

14:42.090 --> 14:43.921
Why didn't he say anything?

14:44.092 --> 14:45.957
(WATER SPLASHING)

14:49.890 --> 14:52.848
Sounds like someone
forgot to turn off the water.

15:29.846 --> 15:30.961
lt's Daniel.

15:40.774 --> 15:41.934
Daniel?

15:43.485 --> 15:44.600
Are you okay?

15:44.820 --> 15:45.855
(GUN COCKING)

15:46.905 --> 15:48.236
Get away from the boy!

15:48.406 --> 15:50.613
-What are you doing?
-What needs to be done.

15:51.243 --> 15:53.074
Move! Both of you!

15:57.958 --> 16:00.620
Back under the water.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.288
Daniel...

16:03.296 --> 16:04.547
Stop right there!

16:04.798 --> 16:06.629
Get away from him, Cole.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.131
I'm not gonna tell you again.

16:08.385 --> 16:09.795
You're the ones hurting him!

16:10.554 --> 16:12.715
Daniel. Come here.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.262
-Let me help...
-Let me go!

16:14.349 --> 16:16.806
-Let me help you.
-Daniel, stop! Stop!

16:16.893 --> 16:18.178
-Let me help you!
-No!

16:18.603 --> 16:20.514
No, wait! Nathan, let him go.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.690
VVhy?

16:26.111 --> 16:30.354
I think that he needs to go
back under the water. All right?

16:30.448 --> 16:32.655
Please, just...

16:32.951 --> 16:34.031
Trust me.

16:34.953 --> 16:37.114
It's okay, Daniel. Lie down.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.412
Relax.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.160
It'll be all right.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.381
I thought you were gonna make me dinner.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.473
Body washed up on the beach today.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.388
Guy with a tattoo.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.895
Really? Did it say, "I heart Haven"?

17:10.697 --> 17:12.904
So, who was he?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.072
I don't know yet.

17:15.911 --> 17:21.031
But I do know that somehow
he's tied to Reverend Driscoll.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.870
Well, maybe he knows
what that symbol means.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.077
Oh, I'm damn sure he does.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.837
The last time I asked him,
he just got all cryptic with me.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.294
Like, religious cryptic?

17:33.136 --> 17:34.501
Jackass cryptic.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.757
We don't exactly get along.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.676
But he hasn't met you yet.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.396
Daniel can only breathe air
for short periods of time now.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.398
-He's transitioning.
-lnto what?

17:53.240 --> 17:58.530
For generations, when The Troubles come,
all Glendower men, young and old,

17:58.745 --> 18:01.031
lose their ability to breathe air.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.324
How do you live?

18:02.624 --> 18:05.036
We migrate to the sea.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.087
The children are affected first.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.455
They need to breathe water
for a few hours every day as they change.

18:11.675 --> 18:14.792
But with Leith, if this was happening,
how could he drown?

18:15.303 --> 18:17.840
He may have panicked,
gone into the sea too soon.

18:18.473 --> 18:21.681
It's why centuries ago, we realized that

18:22.352 --> 18:26.846
on the ebb tide of a new moon,
we had to all go into the water together.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.307
Our unity triggers the final transformation.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.611
-Did my father know about all this?
-Yes.

18:35.699 --> 18:38.486
At first, we assumed you did too,
both of you.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.038
Because you recognized me.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.869
You thought that l was Lucy.

18:48.211 --> 18:51.624
But of course, that's impossible.
Lucy would be in her 50s now.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.214
Daniel has to stay with us.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.548
The change happens in two days!

18:59.806 --> 19:02.138
Why didn't Leith just tell Mary
what was happening?

19:02.392 --> 19:03.472
He was too afraid.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.802
She follows Reverend Driscoll,
and he believes that we're all evil.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.223
Particularly you.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.726
-He thinks I killed his wife.
-Why?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.892
He discovered we were having an affair.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.106
But I didn't kill her.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.903
Your father knew that, but...

19:17.991 --> 19:21.904
Reverend Driscoll isn't a man
to let anything go.

19:23.246 --> 19:24.827
Or anyone.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.416
It was 1983.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.249
The note we found on Leith's body...

19:38.470 --> 19:40.631
You had seen it before.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.428
Because you wrote it.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.092
Look at that handwriting. lt matches the note.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.266
"I'm sorry I have to leave you"?

19:51.941 --> 19:54.603
You were saying goodbye. To whom?

19:55.612 --> 19:57.318
To my first husband.

19:57.989 --> 20:00.025
I wanted to explain, but I was too afraid.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.733
I never gave it to him.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.988
But I knew he'd never
stop looking for me, so...

20:08.208 --> 20:09.664
I found another way.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.454
Like faking your own death?

20:18.468 --> 20:20.208
You're Penny Driscoll.

20:20.512 --> 20:22.298
The Reverend's dead wife.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.974
The boys, they're all gone.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.639
They've been kidnapped.

20:37.362 --> 20:40.479
I found some tire tracks
from a truck down by the cove.

20:40.824 --> 20:42.735
Whoever took the boys
must have gone out that way.

20:42.826 --> 20:45.533
Driscoll has them.
He probably plans to cure them.

20:45.829 --> 20:48.912
-He hasn't had much success with that lately.
-No.

20:49.374 --> 20:51.205
By tomorrow, the boys
won't be able to breathe air.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.165
If we don't get them back, they will all die!

21:01.428 --> 21:04.010
Edmund Driscoll was certainly
never an easy man to live with.

21:05.348 --> 21:10.763
At first, it was an intensity I was attracted to,
but once we came to Haven,

21:11.187 --> 21:15.055
that passion I thought I admired
became so dark.

21:16.192 --> 21:17.272
An obsession.

21:17.861 --> 21:21.695
-The Troubles.
-It brought out such a terrible anger in him.

21:22.532 --> 21:24.864
I knew it was a matter of time
before he turned it on me.

21:25.743 --> 21:28.701
-He didn't abuse you, did he?
-Not physically.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.362
It was more subtle than that.

21:31.916 --> 21:36.080
l was young, na'ive.
I thought that if I just tried harder,

21:36.296 --> 21:38.287
the man I first met would come back to me.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.083
But he never did.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.712
Cole was so different from Edmund, so kind.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.085
When Edmund found out
l was having an affair,

22:07.827 --> 22:09.783
Hey, Reverend.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.455
Miss Ryan.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.916
-I told you, call me Evi.
-Evi.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.411
Listen, if Reverend Driscoll has the children,

22:19.714 --> 22:21.295
we're going to have to reason with him.

22:21.382 --> 22:24.089
There's no reasoning with Driscoll.
Never was.

22:24.594 --> 22:26.459
Well, then we need
to convince Mary to help us.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.215
She's not gonna want to watch her son die.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.171
She believes what Driscoll taught her.

22:30.433 --> 22:32.139
Better dead than cursed.

22:32.310 --> 22:33.971
We'll go to Driscoll,

22:34.062 --> 22:35.427
make him give us our children!

22:35.813 --> 22:38.850
No, the Rev has men of his own.
He'll be ready for you.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.997
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)

23:23.528 --> 23:26.235
Simon Crocker? They killed my dad?

23:28.449 --> 23:30.826
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

23:33.663 --> 23:36.405
-What is this?
-What?

23:37.667 --> 23:39.453
Oh, this is...

23:41.254 --> 23:43.370
It's my grocery list, l was gonna go to the...

23:43.464 --> 23:46.797
Uh-huh, and the Rev'sjust storing it
in his office for you.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.043
You know what? Boys, not now. Listen.

23:50.221 --> 23:52.212
We think the Rev might
be involved in a kidnapping.

23:52.307 --> 23:53.797
Do you have any idea where he is?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.641
I know exactly where he is.

24:07.030 --> 24:08.611
Thank you.

24:17.415 --> 24:19.155
Reverend Edmund Driscoll.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.123
You're under arrest for kidnapping.

24:22.295 --> 24:25.207
-Don't even think about it.
-All right, guys, stop.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.669
Let's find out what this is all about.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.675
This is about taking those
Glendower boys from the compound.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.798
Glendowers?

24:33.973 --> 24:35.679
I haven't been anywhere
near the Glendowers.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.052
I've been right here all morning.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.392
Actually, he has. The boat was late.

24:40.355 --> 24:41.561
Yeah, thanks for telling me.

24:41.731 --> 24:43.221
Thanks for checking your messages.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.854
Oh, right. See, my really good friends,
they call me Evi Crocker.

24:51.324 --> 24:52.564
(DUKE WHISTLING)

24:55.787 --> 24:56.993
Then Mary has them.

24:58.915 --> 25:01.452
-Where is she?
-I have no idea.

25:16.766 --> 25:19.303
-What's happening?
-Evi! Evi, get off the dock!

25:19.477 --> 25:20.808
-Where'd they go?
-You gotta help...

25:20.895 --> 25:23.352
Get him out of here! Quick!
Get him out of here, quick!

25:30.488 --> 25:31.694
Give him to me!

25:34.283 --> 25:35.409
Sorry...

25:36.994 --> 25:38.450
But I saw him first.

25:38.830 --> 25:41.412
-He has our children.
-No. He doesn't.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.582
You're just saying that to keep him alive.

25:44.961 --> 25:46.417
No, Cole, I'm trying to help you.

25:49.841 --> 25:52.127
You said you trusted my father?

25:52.635 --> 25:54.000
Well, you need to trust me now.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.677
The men are drowning. They're drowning!

26:03.813 --> 26:05.144
Let them go!

26:12.822 --> 26:14.187
Let's go.

26:18.661 --> 26:23.405
If our children die,
for as long as we're undenNater,

26:24.542 --> 26:29.036
the beaches and docks of this town
will run red with your blood!

26:31.132 --> 26:33.669
Now you see the kind of people those...

26:34.385 --> 26:37.252
You don't wanna know how close I was
to letting them take you.

26:37.472 --> 26:38.712
Nathan.

26:46.147 --> 26:48.513
Mary's called him
three times in the past hour.

26:48.816 --> 26:51.558
She wanted to meet with me.
She didn't say why.

26:51.736 --> 26:54.148
You told Mary about
the Glendowers' affliction

26:54.238 --> 26:56.229
and what would happen to Daniel
and the other children.

26:56.324 --> 26:57.530
She deserved to know.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.691
So she took the children.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.405
Where?

27:04.832 --> 27:07.824
Well, lwould be happy
to punch him if you won't.

27:08.628 --> 27:10.243
When I was talking with Mary earlier,

27:10.338 --> 27:12.795
she said there was a barn just outside town.

27:13.007 --> 27:15.623
The farmer there lets the food bank
store supplies there.

27:17.762 --> 27:19.343
You're gonna talk to Mary.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.546
Tell her to give us the kids,
tell her you were wrong.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.799
No, I'm not gonna do that.

27:25.770 --> 27:28.386
Then you condemn those children to death.

27:32.109 --> 27:34.942
The children are so weak
they're barely able to stand, Reverend.

27:35.238 --> 27:36.318
Please come here soon.

27:41.536 --> 27:43.276
Everything will be all right.

27:44.622 --> 27:46.453
Reverend Driscoll will be here soon.

27:46.874 --> 27:49.365
You shouldn't have tricked us
into coming here.

27:50.086 --> 27:51.326
You lied.

27:51.671 --> 27:54.333
I know I did, honey. But I had to.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.289
You'll understand someday.

27:56.968 --> 27:58.674
I don't wanna die.

27:59.262 --> 28:03.346
You are not gonna die.
lwould never let anything happen to you.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.932
Dad said you wouldn't understand.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.977
That you wouldn't love us if you knew.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.179
Dan, that's silly.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.857
Because I love you so much.

28:16.612 --> 28:20.321
And when Reverend Driscoll cures you,
everything is gonna go back to normal.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.107
You won't have to leave.

28:22.785 --> 28:24.525
None of you will!

28:25.496 --> 28:27.407
But what if he can't, Mom?

28:27.623 --> 28:31.241
Then I will find somebody who can.
A doctor maybe.

28:31.335 --> 28:32.711
There's got to be someone.

28:35.172 --> 28:36.548
I'm not gonna lose you.

28:37.383 --> 28:41.797
You have to let us go back, Mom.
Please, just do it for me.

28:58.529 --> 29:00.645
Daniel, stay down.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.272
All of you, just stay down!

29:22.803 --> 29:25.180
Stay away! I have a gun!

29:25.973 --> 29:27.179
Great.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.090
She's not gonna use it.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.680
She's desperate though,
and that's unpredictable.

29:31.771 --> 29:33.102
Maybe we can go around back.

29:33.230 --> 29:35.357
No. We don't know where
she's hiding the kids, okay?

29:35.441 --> 29:37.853
We don't wanna put them
in the line of fire, just...

29:40.863 --> 29:43.104
Mary, please, we just want to talk.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.694
I will only talk to Reverend Driscoll.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.627
-l'm here, Mary.
-Please, Reverend!

29:55.920 --> 29:58.457
Help us! The children are sick!

29:58.673 --> 30:00.083
I'll be right there, Mary.

30:01.217 --> 30:03.674
You want me to get her
to release those children?

30:04.178 --> 30:07.045
-I want something from you in return.
-Surprise.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.346
I want to see you both at Sunday services.

30:09.809 --> 30:13.518
I want the town to see that we stand together.

30:15.356 --> 30:16.562
Not a chance.

30:23.698 --> 30:25.484
Well, then I'm not going in there.

30:29.078 --> 30:30.193
Yep.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.080
All right, Mike, bring 'em up.

30:54.603 --> 30:55.729
Penny?

30:56.439 --> 30:57.554
Hello, Edmund.

31:00.735 --> 31:02.100
Is this some kind of trick?

31:03.195 --> 31:04.856
No, it's really me.

31:06.574 --> 31:08.815
All these years, I thought you were dead.

31:10.119 --> 31:12.826
-I did what I had to do.
-You left me?

31:13.789 --> 31:15.495
And our daughter?

31:16.167 --> 31:18.453
-You think I wanted to leave her?
-Just so you could be with that...

31:18.544 --> 31:19.624
Man!

31:21.630 --> 31:24.713
Cole may be troubled, but he's still a man.
A human being like you and l.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.961
And no amount of prayer
or hurting innocent people

31:27.053 --> 31:28.463
is going to take The Troubles away.

31:33.309 --> 31:36.221
You only say that because you don't believe.

31:37.021 --> 31:38.352
Yeah, you never believed.

31:38.439 --> 31:41.306
What I believe, what I know,
is that these children

31:41.400 --> 31:43.777
didn't harm or do anything wrong.

31:43.861 --> 31:47.069
And if you don't get Mary
to release them, they'll die.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.570
-Even you can't want revenge that bad.
-This isn't about revenge.

31:51.660 --> 31:52.786
Yes, it is.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.703
You've convinced your followers,
you may even have convinced yourself,

31:55.790 --> 31:58.247
that you hate the cursed because they're evil.

31:58.959 --> 32:01.450
You hate them because
27 years ago, it was your anger,

32:01.545 --> 32:03.661
your bigotry that drove me away.

32:05.466 --> 32:08.708
What you decide to do here today
isn't about The Troubles.

32:11.305 --> 32:12.670
It's about you.

32:26.403 --> 32:28.655
Mary. It's me.

32:48.717 --> 32:51.379
NATHAN: We have to go in. They screwed us.

32:52.012 --> 32:53.388
I know it.

32:55.057 --> 32:56.137
(DOOR UNLATCHING)

32:58.144 --> 32:59.384
Parker.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.492
Thank you. That was really brave.

33:24.837 --> 33:26.748
Oh, Mary would never have shot me.

33:26.839 --> 33:31.754
No, I meant convincing her
that this is about more than just prayer.

33:32.011 --> 33:34.047
You're right about that, Officer Parker.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.220
The time for prayer is indeed over.

33:39.476 --> 33:43.094
But a good shepherd always
finds a way to save his flock.

33:46.901 --> 33:50.018
Are you sure? Thanks.

34:00.748 --> 34:03.831
Bangorjust sent over Leith's autopsy results.

34:04.627 --> 34:06.583
There's no water in his lungs.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.171
So he didn't drown?

34:08.255 --> 34:09.791
No, and some bruising came up.

34:10.633 --> 34:12.339
Looks pre-mortem.

34:13.636 --> 34:15.126
Leith was murdered.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.278
Thank you again for your help.

34:35.950 --> 34:37.360
Don't thank us yet.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.735
Leith's death wasn't a suicide.

34:42.957 --> 34:44.197
Cole murdered him.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.667
(GASPS)

34:47.711 --> 34:49.042
How did you know?

34:49.296 --> 34:52.663
Daniel told us that he saw
Leith and Cole arguing that night.

34:53.175 --> 34:55.336
That Leith had told him
he had found a way to make sure

34:55.427 --> 34:57.588
his mother had money until they came back.

34:58.180 --> 35:01.092
What he didn't tell Daniel
was it was blackmail.

35:02.977 --> 35:06.515
Leith was gonna sell your note to the Rev,
tell him where you were,

35:06.814 --> 35:08.645
offer up the note as proof.

35:08.941 --> 35:11.774
Driscoll would have come
when I wasn't here to protect her.

35:12.569 --> 35:14.696
He would have turned the town
against all our women.

35:15.239 --> 35:16.979
How could any of them have survived?

35:17.533 --> 35:19.569
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

35:19.660 --> 35:22.117
No, it was my choice.

35:23.247 --> 35:24.578
I had to keep you safe.

35:25.207 --> 35:26.538
But you can't take him to jail.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.539
No.

35:30.504 --> 35:32.415
Bringing him in would be a death sentence.

35:32.965 --> 35:34.296
I know that.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.967
You'll stay on the compound.

35:37.678 --> 35:39.043
Stay safe.

35:41.223 --> 35:43.259
And I'll wait for you.

35:43.559 --> 35:45.515
No matter how long it takes.

35:57.614 --> 36:01.277
I know you thought
you had good reason for killing Leith.

36:02.578 --> 36:04.569
What you did was murder, Cole.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.072
And when The Troubles are over,

36:08.667 --> 36:10.328
I'll come to you

36:10.753 --> 36:12.789
and pay for my crime.

36:14.214 --> 36:15.715
But until then,

36:16.258 --> 36:18.249
you'll watch after my family?

36:18.427 --> 36:20.008
Keep Driscoll away?

36:21.805 --> 36:22.920
Yes.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.432
Can you tell me about Lucy?

36:33.942 --> 36:36.558
Lucy was only in Haven a few months.

36:36.653 --> 36:39.110
Garland Wuornos would've known more,
they worked together.

36:39.239 --> 36:40.979
Helped people who no one else could help.

36:41.367 --> 36:43.232
Did she say anything about
where she was going

36:43.327 --> 36:44.783
after she left Haven?

36:45.371 --> 36:48.738
No. Just like she appeared one day,
she was gone.

36:52.461 --> 36:55.453
It was a few days after
the Colorado Kid murder.

36:56.090 --> 36:59.002
l have a picture of her there
on the beach where they found him.

37:00.636 --> 37:04.094
It was the only time
that anyone ever saw her cry.

37:20.614 --> 37:22.024
Wait!

37:22.658 --> 37:25.365
Before you go, you need to tell me.

37:25.869 --> 37:27.655
Your tattoo, what does it mean?

37:27.871 --> 37:30.533
When Reverend Driscoll and others like him
come for us,

37:30.707 --> 37:32.163
there are those who will fight.

37:32.876 --> 37:35.288
Do you know me?
Do you know why they want me dead?

37:35.671 --> 37:37.286
All I know is you're being watched

37:37.381 --> 37:40.418
in case you decide to follow
in your father's footsteps.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.048
Is that why one of you killed him?

37:43.929 --> 37:46.716
Simon Crocker. Do you remember?

37:47.474 --> 37:48.884
I don't know who killed your father.

37:48.976 --> 37:52.264
But if you wanna stay alive,
I suggest you stay out of his business.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.911
Are you sure we're doing the right thing?

38:16.462 --> 38:19.545
After everything you've seen,
you can even ask me that?

38:20.007 --> 38:21.793
-I know...
-You're sure...

38:22.426 --> 38:24.758
Duke doesn't suspect anything?

38:26.096 --> 38:27.256
No.

38:27.598 --> 38:30.180
He fell for me getting you
away from the church, didn't he?

38:31.185 --> 38:33.642
And now that he knows
his father was murdered,

38:34.938 --> 38:36.018
you've got him.

38:49.369 --> 38:51.280
Your uncles and cousins
are gonna take care of you.

38:51.497 --> 38:53.988
-l'm not scared.
-Good.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.702
'Cause I'm gonna be here.

38:55.918 --> 38:58.625
And I'm gonna love you,
and I'm gonna think about you every minute

38:58.921 --> 39:00.582
until you come home.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.671
I'll miss you too, Mom.

39:09.056 --> 39:10.717
Come on, Daniel.

39:28.617 --> 39:30.653
It gets easier.

39:31.495 --> 39:33.451
Let us help you, Mary.

40:15.289 --> 40:17.325
It's beautiful, in a way.

40:19.293 --> 40:20.658
But it's so sad.

40:21.003 --> 40:23.870
They don't even know
how long they'll be gone.

40:24.881 --> 40:27.418
A whole family just

40:28.594 --> 40:30.084
split in two.

40:35.017 --> 40:37.724
I wanted to learn more about the chief.

40:39.313 --> 40:41.645
There's so much he didn't tell me, so...

40:42.733 --> 40:45.600
I didn't even know the right questions to ask.

40:46.862 --> 40:50.195
Gwen also told me that your father and Lucy

40:51.116 --> 40:53.027
helped a lot of troubled people.

41:02.544 --> 41:06.537
Looks like we've been following
in their footsteps without even knowing it.
