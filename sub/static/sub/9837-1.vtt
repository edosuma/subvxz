01:02.400 --> 01:04.675
Wake up!

01:05.880 --> 01:08.519
Wake up!

01:09.360 --> 01:11.112
Wake up!

01:14.920 --> 01:16.876
Wake up!

01:17.480 --> 01:23.396
Wake up! Yee-ha!

01:25.200 --> 01:27.191
- Oh, it is.
- Wake up!

01:27.360 --> 01:28.429
Yeah!

01:29.880 --> 01:34.635
Get back in the house. Hurry up.
Patty, Elizabeth! You get in here!

01:37.560 --> 01:38.595
Now!

01:38.760 --> 01:41.911
Wake up!

01:47.280 --> 01:49.111
Wake up!

01:54.720 --> 01:58.713
Wake up!

02:07.400 --> 02:09.788
I told you it was
that damn new kid again.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.634
Don't make me come up
after you there, boy!

02:19.280 --> 02:21.396
Wake up!

02:35.960 --> 02:40.078
Excuse me.
Either of you boys have any gum?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.399
I got it.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.993
Well, thanks a lot for the ride, fellas.

04:20.399 --> 04:21.958
Thanks a lot.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.111
Easy, easy, chief.

04:30.720 --> 04:33.712
What's the matter?
Sheriff didn't feed you a banana?

04:36.480 --> 04:39.950
All right, boys.
Nobody said to stop working.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.315
That's right, boys, hard work works.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.918
Mornin', Mr Benedict.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.117
- One, two, three.
- Twenty-seven.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.236
- One, two, three.
- Twenty-eight.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.356
- One, two, three.
- Twenty-nine.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.476
- One, two, three.
- Thirty.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.438
All right. Sit-ups. Hit the deck.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.551
And ready.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.553
Up... down.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.631
Up... down.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.439
Up... down.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.319
Up... down.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.835
Up... down.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.436
Up... down.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.273
Up... Come on, Mr Blaine.
You can do better.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.589
Keep it up.

05:21.760 --> 05:25.196
Up... down.
Let's go, let's go! Up!

05:25.360 --> 05:27.351
Come on. You think this is hard? Up...

05:27.520 --> 05:31.274
...down. Life is hard. Up.
- I can't do it.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.556
I will not tolerate you quitting on me.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.631
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- All right.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.913
You got yourself an extra half hour
of callisthenics after the boys go in.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.989
Look at me. I got 30 years on you.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.673
He ain't you, Benedict.

05:46.920 --> 05:51.152
I know that's what you want,
but he ain't you.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.311
You just got yourself another hour.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.357
Make it two and you got a deal.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.758
Welcome home.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.314
Mr Benedict.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.435
Billy, bring that ladder.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.072
- Bradley.
- Huh?

07:06.240 --> 07:07.753
Who is that?

07:08.360 --> 07:09.793
Who?

07:10.040 --> 07:11.553
Sara.

07:11.720 --> 07:14.917
- What's she doing here?
- It's summer. Back from college.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.548
That's not Sara.
That's too big to be Sara.

07:17.720 --> 07:18.789
- She has...
- Tits.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.393
Place looks great.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.754
Doesn't it?

07:21.920 --> 07:24.229
All right, Mr Tucker. That's enough.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.349
Wait a minute.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.235
Take these bags into the house, please.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.397
Watch it! Hey!

07:49.200 --> 07:53.716
- I have some fragile things in there.
- Mr Tucker, please be careful.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.757
Get it into the barn right now!

07:55.920 --> 07:59.151
- Who's that?
- He's the new boy. A handful.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.839
Look at you, honey.
You light up this whole house.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.357
I gotta get that.
Mr Tucker, take the bags upstairs.

08:16.720 --> 08:17.789
Hello.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.911
This is Eugene.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.310
Yeah, well...

08:22.480 --> 08:24.755
Look, would you please be careful?

08:28.800 --> 08:31.189
Oops.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.318
Mr Tucker, get these things picked up.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.356
- What happened out there?
- Nothing.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.433
If he gives you any trouble
just let me know.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.078
I can take care of myself.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.310
Of course you can.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.993
Excuse me.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.355
How about a whiskey, Junior?

10:02.680 --> 10:04.272
Good song.

10:04.440 --> 10:07.000
Hey, Molly,
come here and dance with us.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.152
You wanna dance?

10:12.040 --> 10:13.473
Sure.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.712
- What are you doing, man?
- What?

10:48.880 --> 10:50.552
I said, what are you doing?

10:51.640 --> 10:53.710
No nigger music in here.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.111
What's that in the juke for?

10:58.800 --> 11:00.631
It ain't.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.952
Let her go.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.950
- You say something?
- Come on, be cool.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.079
Cool?

11:10.800 --> 11:13.598
- What kind of word is "cool"?
- Too many syllables?

11:13.760 --> 11:16.149
Come on, Travis, leave him alone.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.628
You're not from around here,
are you, boy?

11:20.720 --> 11:23.234
You need a ride to the bus stop?

11:25.120 --> 11:26.872
No thank you, sheriff.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.190
Just here for a job, that's all.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.670
- Music teacher, Benedict's place.
- Benedict expecting you?

11:32.840 --> 11:34.558
Yes, sir, he is.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.355
You enjoy making me look like a fool.

11:41.520 --> 11:44.353
You do a pretty good job
of that yourself.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.398
Let's go.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.431
Y'all come back now.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.517
I was hoping you'd come out.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.831
I keep telling him we're old news

12:08.000 --> 12:11.629
but he never was one
to keep up on current events.

12:14.640 --> 12:18.679
Look, I run a club on the other side
of the tracks, so to speak.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.115
- How's the booze?
- Terrible.

12:23.880 --> 12:27.031
Step in sometime. Ask for Molly.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.273
Hey, Molly.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.795
How come that record was on the juke?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.594
I slipped it in
when nobody was looking.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.915
I'll see you around, Molly.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.551
I'll definitely see you around.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.112
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:46.280 --> 12:49.158
You're more than qualified
for this job, Mr Cabe.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.072
You're gonna find these kids
are damaged goods.

12:53.240 --> 12:57.756
Some of them are orphaned,
others are sent here by their parents,

12:57.920 --> 13:00.434
by the juvenile authorities,
a great pity.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.155
A strong hand is what they need.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.152
Discipline.

13:16.280 --> 13:19.272
They need role models, Mr Cabe.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.755
You don't have to worry about me.

13:28.920 --> 13:33.277
You need somebody to get the boys
ready for the 4th of July concert.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.759
I'm your guy.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.753
I saw your sign when I
walked through the gate

13:37.920 --> 13:39.148
and I agree with it.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.756
I'll work hard with these boys
and I'll teach them their music.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.232
Wake up.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.554
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Do about what?

14:50.720 --> 14:52.472
About what? About her.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.552
Go over there and talk to her.
She wants to talk to you.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.790
- No she doesn't.
- Yeah she does.

14:57.960 --> 15:00.235
- No, really?
- No, really?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.868
- You really think so?
- I know so.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.951
You look fine. Go talk to her.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.838
OK.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.319
Go.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.311
Wonder what he's thinking about.

15:24.680 --> 15:27.513
I saw you looking gaga
at that girl in church.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.795
No I wasn't.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.473
Yeah, sure you weren't.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.756
Oh, Alan! Oh, Alan!

15:32.920 --> 15:35.559
Come fondle my massive milkers.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.429
One, two, three and...

16:00.000 --> 16:01.911
Quarter note, sharp attack.

16:02.640 --> 16:03.914
Good.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.669
Bradley, you've got to loosen up, man.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.434
You're playing like a robot.
Try without this.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.716
- I can't play without music.
- Try it.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.398
I can't.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.636
Jesse, you gonna joins us?

16:29.800 --> 16:30.915
No.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.354
- No?
- No.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.358
Play chords with your left
and pick with the right.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.795
- Pick with the right?
- Pick with the right.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.636
Kinda like this, huh?

16:44.800 --> 16:48.634
That's just the right look for you.
I know you better than you think.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.634
If he don't want to participate,
I've got a job for him.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.392
Mr Tucker.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.473
Thanks.

17:12.640 --> 17:16.076
Come on, let's go.
And one, two, three and...

17:50.000 --> 17:52.195
- What is your problem?
- Excuse me?

17:52.360 --> 17:56.148
You've taken some disliking to me.
Well, I don't much like you either.

17:56.320 --> 18:00.518
So why don't you stay in your hole and
I'll stay as far away as possible, OK?

18:38.800 --> 18:42.156
# Look at old Jesse there down in a hole

18:45.800 --> 18:49.429
# He acts real tough
but he looks like a mole

18:50.280 --> 18:51.713
What's your problem?

18:52.560 --> 18:55.358
# His punishment was digging
in the mud and the sand

18:55.520 --> 19:00.036
# When he could've been playing
with the boys in the band

19:01.600 --> 19:02.999
Dick.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.952
Come on, let's go.

20:37.120 --> 20:40.032
- Get the lead out.
- Come on, come on.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.951
Let's go.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.952
Shut up.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.352
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:18.920 --> 22:22.674
Jeez Louise.
What's wrong with you guys today?

22:22.840 --> 22:25.912
You were bad before
but you're stinking up the place now.

22:26.080 --> 22:29.516
- What was that music you were playing?
- We'd like to play that.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.477
Yeah, it gave me a boner.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.393
- Will you teach us?
- No.

22:35.560 --> 22:39.394
- Why not?
- Mr Benedict wouldn't appreciate it.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.793
Keep going, Jesse.
Everybody join in.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.552
Toby, quarter notes on that.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.873
- Quarter notes on that.
- Straight quarter notes?

22:53.320 --> 22:55.356
One and three on the bass drum.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.319
Add a backbeat.

22:58.920 --> 22:59.955
Good.

23:01.920 --> 23:02.955
Bradley.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.872
Just play the...

23:05.760 --> 23:07.637
It's not on here.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.279
You'll get used to it.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.716
Big boy, just play the bass line.
Like this:

23:12.880 --> 23:14.871
Da-da-da-da.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.634
Good.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.831
It's called rock and roll, boys.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.949
Only a select few
know about this right now,

23:48.640 --> 23:51.950
but I'll tell you something,
in the not-too-distant future

23:52.120 --> 23:55.271
it is gonna burn through this country
like a prairie fire.

23:56.920 --> 23:58.911
You think you can handle it?

23:59.520 --> 24:01.829
- You got the guts?
- Dang straight, man.

24:02.280 --> 24:03.998
Well, you can't.

24:04.160 --> 24:08.392
Not yet. You gotta get better. OK?

24:08.560 --> 24:11.472
Now this is the deal.
You practice real hard

24:11.640 --> 24:15.235
and you learn your music
for the show, and then...

24:15.400 --> 24:18.517
...then we'll talk about rock and roll.

24:18.680 --> 24:21.194
You guys gotta practice.

24:28.280 --> 24:30.794
I hope you taste better than you look.

24:33.160 --> 24:36.470
Come here, you stinkin' bird.
Get over here!

24:47.800 --> 24:49.392
Let's go. Let's go up there.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.993
Move out of the way, boys.
Coming through.

25:00.120 --> 25:03.590
- Let's get it and go.
- Come on, hurry up.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.678
Excuse me.

25:11.480 --> 25:14.199
Hey, you guys,
know what would be great?

25:14.960 --> 25:16.029
What?

25:16.200 --> 25:18.475
- Start our own rock and roll band.
- Easy.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.358
- Could we do that?
- We could.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.159
Jesse, wanna join
our rock and roll band?

25:25.640 --> 25:27.392
No.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.508
- Beautiful.
- Most beautiful girl I ever saw.

25:36.680 --> 25:39.478
- Only girl you ever saw.
- I'll kick your butt.

25:39.640 --> 25:42.234
- Try it, blimpo.
- I'm gonna nail her.

25:43.480 --> 25:44.913
What?

25:45.080 --> 25:48.834
I'll light up Benedict's precious
daughter like a pinball machine.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.755
What do you mean?

25:54.920 --> 25:57.673
What do you mean what do I mean?
What do you think?

25:57.840 --> 25:58.955
Yeah, sure you are.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.554
You wanna bet? Huh?

26:02.320 --> 26:06.233
Come on, you boys must have
a little chore allowance saved up.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.834
Put your money where your big mouth is.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.877
OK.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.272
- I'll bet.
- Me too.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.749
- How much, two dollars?
- Wait.

26:15.920 --> 26:19.356
- We shouldn't bet about this.
- What's the matter? Chicken?

26:19.520 --> 26:21.988
No, I'm not chicken,
I just don't think...

26:22.160 --> 26:25.118
You shut up.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.999
- You what?
- It's not right.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.628
- She's a nice girl.
- So marry her.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.075
Are you kidding me?

26:33.640 --> 26:38.156
Look at her sitting back there.
That's Benedict's little pride and joy.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.311
This'll teach him.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.434
Fine, you don't want in? No problem.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.398
- How about the rest of you guys?
- I'm in.

26:55.600 --> 26:59.036
Psst.
Hey, Jesse. Jesse.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.313
Hey, Sara.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.392
How you doing?

27:12.880 --> 27:14.598
Did you have a good ride?

27:16.160 --> 27:19.550
- Nice legs. On you too, Sara.
- I've had enough.

27:22.880 --> 27:26.793
Oops.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.517
- Shut up.
- Regular Cary Grant.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.272
Smooth move, ex-lax.

27:43.720 --> 27:45.073
Hi.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.750
You're not supposed to be in here.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.073
No, it's OK,
I get invited in here quite a bit.

27:53.240 --> 27:54.832
My father will be back.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.958
- Do you want me to go?
- Do what you want?

28:06.200 --> 28:09.237
- OK, I'll go.
- No, don't.

28:09.400 --> 28:13.439
Listen, Sara, I'm really sorry
that I threw dirt on your feet.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.878
You're the first pretty girl
we've had around and...

28:19.040 --> 28:21.031
...I guess I got a little flustered.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.875
- What are you doing?
- Just writing a letter for my father.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.831
Is this a picture of you?

28:31.560 --> 28:34.279
- Yes.
- Really?

28:34.440 --> 28:35.919
Yeah.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.235
I got a little picture too, actually.

28:45.680 --> 28:48.148
- Are these your parents?
- Yeah.

28:48.320 --> 28:50.754
Handsome couple. Where are they now?

28:50.920 --> 28:52.638
They died.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.473
- Oh.
- Yeah, in a car crash.

28:55.640 --> 28:59.918
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK, it was a long time ago.

29:01.560 --> 29:04.074
My mom died when I was eight.

29:06.680 --> 29:10.878
I remember that she had this one freckle
on the end of her nose.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.474
She would call it her kiss button.

29:14.520 --> 29:19.435
Whenever I would touch it
she would give me a kiss.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.156
Hey, what's the matter?

29:27.320 --> 29:30.118
Nothing. Just hadn't
thought about it for a while.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.594
Look, I should go.

29:37.000 --> 29:37.989
Why?

29:39.560 --> 29:41.676
I'll see you later.

29:54.200 --> 29:57.829
- Try it without the sheet music.
- I can't play without the music.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.189
I wanna see you after class.

30:06.360 --> 30:09.636
OK, guys, and one, two, three...

30:16.040 --> 30:17.758
- You scared?
- Yeah.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.753
Yeah, me too. Stay there.
Stay there. Stay there.

30:21.560 --> 30:25.348
All right. Go from there to here
without walking. No running either.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.318
- How am I supposed to do that?
- I don't know.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.869
Just use your imagination, man.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.716
Come on. Come on.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.156
Yeah, that's it.

30:46.320 --> 30:48.629
- Now something else.
- What else?

30:48.800 --> 30:51.075
I don't know, something else.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.231
- Like what?
- Anything.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.597
Walk like a monkey,
cluck like a chicken. I don't care.

30:57.360 --> 31:01.035
- Monkeys don't cluck.
- Come on, just do it.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.554
Come on.

31:06.200 --> 31:09.317
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

31:24.280 --> 31:25.474
Good, man.

31:25.640 --> 31:28.393
- How long should I do this?
- Till you get it right.

31:28.560 --> 31:31.279
Now come on. Come on, man.

31:31.440 --> 31:34.512
Yes, yes, yes.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.276
- What's up?
- Pork chops for dinner.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.758
What a dick.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.474
Hi.

31:53.840 --> 31:55.193
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.072
I got something for you.

32:02.040 --> 32:05.555
- It looked a little worse for the wear.
- Thanks.

32:07.240 --> 32:09.356
It's an old frame of my mother's.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.079
- You didn't have to...
- I...

32:20.040 --> 32:21.792
OK.

32:21.960 --> 32:24.428
Well, I'll talk to you later.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.078
- Don't sleep much, do you?
- Uh-huh.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.276
What are you running from?

32:56.080 --> 32:58.435
What makes you think I'm running?

33:00.120 --> 33:02.111
You're a runner all right.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.437
- Morning.
- Morning.

34:02.600 --> 34:06.354
- What are you doing up so early?
- Couldn't sleep.

34:06.520 --> 34:10.228
This is what I was looking forward to
most about coming back here.

34:10.400 --> 34:13.949
- Do you ride?
- No, we aren't allowed to ride them.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.159
Pretty good at cleaning up
their crap, though.

34:18.920 --> 34:20.478
Did you like the picture?

34:21.280 --> 34:22.632
Yeah.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.320
Listen, there's something
I need to tell you.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.155
I never did get to thank you.

34:41.320 --> 34:42.833
For the picture.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.876
I love this time of morning.

34:52.719 --> 34:54.597
Would you like to kiss me?

35:29.360 --> 35:32.113
Now walk like a monkey
and cluck like a chicken.

35:57.360 --> 36:01.035
You know, I've been thinking.
I've never done it before.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.471
Maybe you could teach me.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.271
- Teach you?
- Yeah.

36:08.440 --> 36:11.034
'Cause it's going to be
a long, hot summer.

36:12.280 --> 36:13.269
Mm-hmm.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.950
Do you ever let other people touch it?

36:21.240 --> 36:24.277
- You mean my guitar.
- Of course.

36:25.360 --> 36:28.033
What else would I be talking about?

36:39.800 --> 36:42.792
That's it. Just go. Let it go, man.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.555
All right, now play it. One...

37:07.400 --> 37:11.712
They are doing so much better.
They're starting to sound like a band.

37:11.880 --> 37:14.314
It's your methods, Mr Cabe...

37:14.480 --> 37:15.833
...in the classroom.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.516
And those silly, stupid dances you're
teaching Kroft and Blaine in the field.

37:20.680 --> 37:24.753
- I'm trying to make it fun for them.
- You didn't see them when they came.

37:24.920 --> 37:27.195
Delinquents running around with gangs.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.510
Control got them this far.

37:29.680 --> 37:33.355
I am so sure everything you've done
for these kids is great.

37:33.520 --> 37:34.748
Thank you.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.832
I just feel there are other ways
of getting results.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.437
Mr Cabe, I'm not gonna argue with you.
I can always get another music teacher.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.355
- What do you want?
- Wanna hear some tunes.

37:50.520 --> 37:52.715
No. No more records.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.917
- Why not?
- You heard them all.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.719
- We'll listen to them again.
- I can't.

37:58.880 --> 38:01.553
- Why can't we?
- I just can't, OK?

38:01.720 --> 38:04.951
It's Benedict, isn't it?
He found out.

38:05.640 --> 38:09.474
It's OK. He gets to everybody
sooner or later.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.151
Wait a minute.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.190
- All right!
- Yes!

38:21.440 --> 38:24.955
- OK, any of you guys got a radio?
- No. Why?

38:25.760 --> 38:27.557
- Forget it.
- What?

38:27.720 --> 38:31.713
What? I'm not gonna get you
cranked up over nothing. Forget it.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.791
Come on, tell us.

38:35.360 --> 38:36.679
All right.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.190
There's this DJ I know about.

38:43.360 --> 38:46.432
- What's a DJ?
- Don't you know nothing, man?

38:47.880 --> 38:49.916
Tell him, Mr Cabe.

38:51.640 --> 38:54.916
A DJ's a disc jockey,
a man who spins platters on the radio.

38:55.080 --> 38:58.595
There's this one fella in particular,
out of Memphis I believe,

38:58.760 --> 39:02.799
and he plays the hottest rock and roll,
I mean real scorchers.

39:02.960 --> 39:05.315
Strictly underground stuff.

39:05.480 --> 39:08.677
Now, he calls himself
the Midnight Rider.

39:08.840 --> 39:14.119
Everybody has tried to shut him down.
Parents, school teachers, government.

39:14.280 --> 39:19.434
President Eisenhower tried to
shut him down, but nobody could.

39:19.600 --> 39:22.160
He's always one step ahead of the law.

39:22.320 --> 39:25.278
Nobody can stop the Midnight Rider.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.317
How can we hear him?

39:27.480 --> 39:29.948
Well, like I said, you need a radio.

39:32.760 --> 39:37.993
You probably even need a short wave
all the way out here to pick him up.

39:38.160 --> 39:39.912
Now beat it.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.077
I can fix the radio in the garage.

39:47.240 --> 39:49.310
There's a book in class about radios.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.710
- All we need is the pieces.
- Let's do it.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.358
- Sure you don't want me to do this?
- No, I gotta do it.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.078
Keep your eyes peeled.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.075
Bradley! Bradley, come on!

40:35.120 --> 40:36.314
What are you doing?

40:36.880 --> 40:39.633
- What's that?
- This...

40:39.800 --> 40:42.951
...is a project for science class.

40:43.120 --> 40:47.796
We're getting extra credit for
taking apart radios and examining them.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.918
You can do better than that.

40:54.040 --> 40:57.112
We wanna listen to a radio show
that Mr Cabe told us about

40:57.280 --> 41:00.033
and I need one of these to build
a short wave radio.

41:00.760 --> 41:02.637
- What show?
- Midnight Rider.

41:02.800 --> 41:05.268
Come on, he's coming!
Come on.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.277
Go on, take it. Take it.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.995
We listen to Midnight Rider in college.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.479
Yeah?

41:14.000 --> 41:16.912
Thank you, Sara.

41:18.880 --> 41:22.156
You sort of cradle the neck
with your left hand.

41:22.320 --> 41:24.197
And you rest this on your knee.

41:24.360 --> 41:27.193
All right, let's say like a D chord.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.830
- What?
- Nothing.

41:32.720 --> 41:36.315
You put your first finger
in the second fret.

41:36.480 --> 41:39.199
- Put this one here, that one there.
- Mm-hmm.

41:40.640 --> 41:45.031
Now with your right...
You've got to hold on tighter here.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.315
- OK.
- OK?

41:46.480 --> 41:47.993
- OK.
- OK.

41:50.360 --> 41:53.511
All right, now strum.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.475
- That's good.
- That's bad.

42:01.640 --> 42:04.518
- That was good. It was good.
- You know it sounds bad.

42:04.680 --> 42:08.878
I've got it. In the bridge coming off
the verse, you play like before, right?

42:09.040 --> 42:12.112
And then I'll answer you.

42:12.280 --> 42:14.840
And we'll do it four times, right?

42:16.200 --> 42:18.714
- It'll be perfect.
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.

42:21.200 --> 42:24.033
Why don't you just
keep doing it? D chord.

42:24.920 --> 42:26.672
I've got a problem.

42:30.680 --> 42:33.592
- I guess Jesse's gonna win that bet.
- Shut up.

42:50.680 --> 42:53.478
- Hi, Sara.
- Hi, Bradley.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.913
- Did you get that radio working?
- Yeah. Thank you for that.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.318
You OK?

43:04.640 --> 43:06.471
Yeah, I'm fine.

43:10.280 --> 43:11.872
What's wrong?

43:20.040 --> 43:22.110
There's something I have to tell you.

43:28.520 --> 43:29.999
A bet? A stupid bet?

43:30.160 --> 43:32.435
Well, come on,
let's win that bet for you.

43:32.600 --> 43:34.431
Come on, here I am.

43:36.640 --> 43:38.551
- That's what I thought.
- Sara...

43:38.720 --> 43:42.110
It started out as a bet,
but it's not about that anymore.

43:42.280 --> 43:45.192
That's almost as good
as that lie about your parents,

43:45.360 --> 43:47.828
or whoever those people
in the picture were.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.719
You were using me
to get at my father, weren't you?

43:50.880 --> 43:53.155
That what this was all about?

43:53.320 --> 43:55.993
Well, I'm not my father, Jesse.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.991
Now, let's start off with...

44:10.680 --> 44:13.558
- Find the Midnight Rider.
- I'm trying to.

44:15.320 --> 44:18.710
Are you out there,
brothers of the night?

44:18.880 --> 44:20.757
- That's it.
- Are you listening?

44:20.920 --> 44:23.832
Flying to you
on night-silent black wings.

44:24.000 --> 44:29.518
Getting inside you, urging you,
telling you that tonight anything,

44:29.680 --> 44:32.478
anything can happen.

44:33.560 --> 44:34.959
Are your ears open?

44:35.480 --> 44:40.156
Because the ears and not the eyes
are the windows of the soul.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.992
Listen, my children.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.959
Listen.

44:44.120 --> 44:46.156
Listen.

44:46.320 --> 44:48.231
Listen.

45:19.960 --> 45:21.234
Jesse.

45:35.960 --> 45:37.712
- Where are you going?
- Him.

45:37.880 --> 45:41.156
- Why?
- I want my money.

45:42.520 --> 45:44.033
Jesse.

45:44.200 --> 45:47.272
I thought you were gonna nail Sara.
Did you chicken out?

45:47.440 --> 45:49.749
- Yeah, you chicken out?
- We had a bet.

45:50.680 --> 45:53.035
- Pay up.
- That's right. Put up or shut up.

46:01.080 --> 46:03.799
Jesse, wait a second. Jesse.

47:42.360 --> 47:43.679
Jesse.

47:45.320 --> 47:46.594
Jesse.

47:47.240 --> 47:48.309
What happened?

47:48.480 --> 47:50.277
- Where are you going?
- Out.

47:50.440 --> 47:53.830
Bradley. Hey.
What if Benedict catches us?

47:55.040 --> 47:56.792
Let's go.

47:58.200 --> 48:00.760
- This is it. Come on.
- Sure we can get in?

48:04.560 --> 48:06.994
How do they know about...?

48:11.000 --> 48:12.638
Hello.

48:19.080 --> 48:22.675
- You know what you're gonna say?
- Shut up. Let me talk.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.230
- How do we get in?
- I don't like this.

48:32.440 --> 48:35.398
- Yeah.
- It's all right.

48:40.480 --> 48:41.913
Hi.

48:43.920 --> 48:46.070
We're friends of Cabe's.

48:54.560 --> 48:56.039
Come on.

48:59.520 --> 49:00.839
Hi.

49:53.560 --> 49:55.551
Shut up!

50:15.240 --> 50:17.196
What did you call me?

50:22.280 --> 50:24.748
Take your time.

50:56.360 --> 50:57.793
Hey.

50:57.960 --> 50:59.234
Hey.

50:59.840 --> 51:00.909
It was me.

51:03.600 --> 51:05.989
- What?
- I told Sara about the bet.

51:06.160 --> 51:07.513
What did you do that for?

51:08.080 --> 51:09.911
'Cause you're an asshole.

51:10.080 --> 51:13.197
You don't make a bet on a girl
about something like that.

51:18.240 --> 51:20.231
You like her, don't you?

51:21.720 --> 51:24.553
- Huh?
- Yeah.

51:28.480 --> 51:30.277
But she's in love with you.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.239
You're blowing it, man.

51:57.200 --> 51:58.918
What are you doing, boy?

51:59.080 --> 52:01.753
Take it easy on that stuff,
it'll make you blind.

52:01.920 --> 52:04.992
- How you doing?
- You brought the troops with you.

52:05.160 --> 52:08.391
Better not make a habit of this,
we'll both get in trouble.

52:09.400 --> 52:11.470
How you doing?

52:12.760 --> 52:16.639
- I don't know, man.
- You got it pretty bad, don't you?

52:16.800 --> 52:19.951
She ain't nothing
like what I thought she was.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.392
They never are.

52:23.120 --> 52:27.272
Why don't you get up there tonight
and jam with the rest of them?

52:28.520 --> 52:31.910
- Why don't you?
- Maybe I will.

52:32.080 --> 52:34.071
Come on, sugar, let's dance.

52:34.840 --> 52:36.956
As long as you're here
have a good time.

53:45.360 --> 53:46.998
I'm gonna do this.

55:27.600 --> 55:30.273
- You did good tonight, Jesse.
- I did, didn't I?

55:30.440 --> 55:32.715
Yeah, you were good. You were hot.

55:33.920 --> 55:36.593
Well, well, well.
What have we got here?

55:36.760 --> 55:39.991
- A little after hours action, huh?
- Travis, you're drunk.

55:40.160 --> 55:41.388
Just you and me.

55:41.560 --> 55:43.949
What's the matter with you?
It's you and me.

55:44.120 --> 55:46.918
Completely off the record. No badge...

55:47.080 --> 55:49.640
- Sleep it off, man.
... no gun.

55:50.640 --> 55:53.438
Hey! Hey!

56:02.440 --> 56:05.113
Cabe, man,
come on, that's enough.

56:05.520 --> 56:07.750
- Stop.
- Let go. Let go.

56:07.920 --> 56:10.309
- Jesse, get him out of here.
- Let me at him!

56:10.480 --> 56:14.075
Just get him out! Are you crazy?
He's a goddamn sheriff!

56:20.400 --> 56:25.269
I don't know. I've never felt like that,
never played like that. It was amazing.

56:25.440 --> 56:29.069
I know, but I don't think running away
is a good idea.

56:29.960 --> 56:32.110
Well, I'm not going back in there.

56:33.640 --> 56:36.108
- Can't beat these sons of bitches.
- You can.

56:36.280 --> 56:39.352
- It's a rigged game.
- It's a rigged game if you run away.

56:39.520 --> 56:41.397
They automatically win that way.

56:42.480 --> 56:44.436
I wouldn't do it.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.670
I wouldn't do it if I were you.

56:54.520 --> 56:56.636
If you're gonna go I'd go now.

56:56.800 --> 57:00.759
He'll be up anytime.
I'll cover for you as long as I can.

57:00.920 --> 57:03.115
- You got bucks?
- Yeah, I got some.

57:06.120 --> 57:10.671
- I'm gonna miss you, man.
- Same.

57:11.520 --> 57:14.671
All right, you know where to get me
if you need me.

57:33.600 --> 57:37.991
You know, I want to give you something.

57:40.840 --> 57:42.751
I wanna give you this.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.231
- No, man, I can't take that.
- Yeah.

57:47.400 --> 57:51.359
A good friend of mine gave me this...

57:51.520 --> 57:54.273
...and I want to give it to you.

57:54.440 --> 57:57.159
So please, take it. Go ahead.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.831
Thanks.

58:01.000 --> 58:05.152
I'd learn how to fix it 'cause it costs
an arm and a leg to get it repaired.

58:06.560 --> 58:08.471
Glad to have you back.

58:11.200 --> 58:14.272
You young people are coming to a time

58:14.440 --> 58:17.000
when difficult decisions must be made,

58:18.200 --> 58:20.111
as is our country.

58:21.360 --> 58:24.158
There is a moral decay
eating away at our land.

58:25.840 --> 58:28.400
In books, on television,

58:29.800 --> 58:31.518
in the movies...

58:31.680 --> 58:33.830
- Pass...
... in our own government.

58:35.960 --> 58:39.748
And now in this new music.

58:41.800 --> 58:44.439
It is a foul, black music,

58:45.800 --> 58:47.597
godless and profane.

58:49.480 --> 58:52.119
I implore you to say no to it.

58:52.840 --> 58:54.831
Shout no to it.

58:58.040 --> 59:01.430
And now let's bow our heads
in a moment of silent prayer

59:01.600 --> 59:07.152
and ask God for the strength
and courage to fight this evil

59:07.320 --> 59:11.154
that threatens the very foundation
of our American way of life.

59:12.840 --> 59:14.273
Sara.

59:15.720 --> 59:18.837
Sara, I'm sorry about last night.

59:19.000 --> 59:23.391
About the bet and everything.
I got no excuses.

59:23.560 --> 59:26.757
Except that you scare me. I mean...

59:26.920 --> 59:29.992
That first day you showed up
I remember thinking,

59:30.160 --> 59:34.392
"This is the kinda girl that would never
want to have anything to do with me. "

59:34.560 --> 59:37.120
So I guess
I must've known already that...

59:38.360 --> 59:41.272
...I liked you... and it scared me.

59:43.200 --> 59:45.634
You were right about the picture.

59:45.800 --> 59:47.153
It came with the wallet.

59:47.320 --> 59:51.233
They just looked like the kind
of folks a guy should have and...

59:51.400 --> 59:53.152
...I just sort of adopted them.

59:53.320 --> 59:55.675
So who were your parents?

59:56.280 --> 59:58.475
Who were my parents?

59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.474
My father was a wildcat
and my mother was a waitress.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.030
Or maybe she was a salesgirl
and he was in the service.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:10.833
Or maybe they were just two
teenagers who met behind a bar.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.193
You heard about the trouble
we had at the Lizard Lounge.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.590
I have. I'm sorry, Travis.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.149
You were right.
I should've fired the guy.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.869
- I'll do it as soon as I get back.
- I don't want you to do that.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.759
I've been checking around
like we talked about.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.799
I'm expecting a phone call from
the sheriff in Biloxi, Mississippi.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:51.431
They had trouble there a couple years
back and the description could be Cabe.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.238
I ain't sure that it's him.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.036
But if it is I don't want you
to spook him, so sit tight.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.237
I want this man
just as bad as you, Eugene.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.191
Just as bad as you.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.232
We're cookin' now, daddy.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.990
Who is responsible for this?

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.834
I am.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.871
No he's not, I am.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.358
It's me.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.758
You know who it is.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.352
All right, everybody
back to the dormitory.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.398
You, come with me.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.273
I've been easy on you long enough now.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.476
This is your new bed.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.118
Get used to it.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.319
Jesse.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.112
- You OK in there?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.558
I thought you guys were heading
to the girls school.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.668
We decided not to.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.793
Why?

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.318
You know...

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.635
Look, you like her, don't you?

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.630
- I can't stop thinking about her.
- Then go down and see her.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.833
OK. Thanks, Jesse.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.675
Wait up. Come on, man, wait up.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.196
- Come on, slowpoke.
- Guys, keep it down.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.914
What are you doing?

01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.798
Be careful.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.316
- What's he doing?
- Lame-brain, what's it look like?

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.752
They're coming.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.040
- There she is.
- Listen, maybe we should go.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.712
- Come on.
- Yeah, we should go.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.996
- Shut up, wuss.
- Come on.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.719
Come on, let's go...

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.678
- Turn the radio on.
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.353
Are you leaving?

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.436
Come on, come on, come on. All right.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.353
This is the Midnight Rider
on KCWR,

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.832
riding on the silver waves
of this moonlit night.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.752
Are you out there?

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.638
Are you listening?

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.678
Do you wanna dance?

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.351
OK.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.796
What are you boys doing here?

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.349
- What's your name?
- Rebecca.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.918
My name's Alan...

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.073
...and I love you.

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.911
- I can't stay.
- Why not?

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.196
My father, he'll know I'm gone.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.518
- He's gotta know someday.
- I know.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.438
Don't you want to get away?

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.194
Don't you everjust want to go
and keep on going?

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.910
- Sure.
- I know I do.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:40.269
I don't want to see nothing but blacktop
for a couple thousand miles.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.991
Where would you go?

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:48.036
There's this place. They've got this
little bar and a stage in the corner.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:52.239
On Friday nights everybody comes down
and gets to drink and makes noise

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.960
so you can barely hear the music.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.871
But I wouldn't care, I'd just play.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.431
And keep playing till there
wasn't anything left to play

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.989
and then I'd play
until they dragged me out.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.914
Where is it?

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.073
I don't know.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.993
You'll find it.

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:53.599
Go!

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.598
Hey, what gives?

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.434
He's gone.

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:03.917
What's going on?

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.277
- What are you doing out here?
- I wanna know what happened?

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:14.075
Your Mr Cabe is a wanted man.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.479
He's a murderer.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.434
What's the matter with you guys?

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.599
- Don't let Benedict see you like this.
- How are we supposed to act?

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.594
- You believe what they're saying?
- I suppose the cops made it up, huh?

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.149
- I don't care what the cops say.
- Then where is he, Jesse?

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.117
- Where did he go?
- He'll be back.

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:56.589
He'd be back if he was coming back.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.591
You guys can go to hell.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.474
Jesse? Where are you going?

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.598
Go, Jesse!

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.395
Yahoo!

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.597
There's this friend of mine,
a coloured guy.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.672
We were playing gigs in Biloxi,
Mississippi.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.512
All coloured clubs.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:05.310
And then this one night this guy
who owned a white club came in.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.074
He heard us.
He thought we were pretty good,

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.152
and he offered us a gig at his club.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.950
He said that he didn't really care
what colour the musicians were

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.476
as long as they were good,
and we were good.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.471
Josh tried to talk me out of it.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.153
He said he didn't think it was worth
making the trouble over.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.074
There was something about the idea
that they didn't want us there

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:34.153
that made me want to play that gig
more than anything else in the world.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.392
So we played.
At least we started to play.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:45.473
Got eight bars through the first song
and then all the troubles started.

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.916
Someone threw a beer bottle
at Josh's face.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.876
And someone had a knife.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.952
I tried to stop it with my hand.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.509
But it went through my hand
and into his gut.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:02.036
I swear my hand was stuck to his belly.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.272
And I looked up and...

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:09.069
...there was this...
this kind of puzzled look on his face.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.630
And I picked up this broken beer bottle

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.473
and I went after the son
of a bitch who got Josh.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.032
So I got away.

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.351
And I ran, and I ran...

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.995
...and I'm still running.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.512
Maybe it's time to stop.

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.478
Don't throw my words back at me.
This is different.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.790
- How is this different?
- Get serious.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.872
- You didn't do anything wrong.
- I killed a white man

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.792
in order to help a coloured man,

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.554
and in Mississippi
that is as wrong as you get.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.278
Fight them.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.712
I'll help you.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.553
Come on, get out. Get out.

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.314
Get the hell out of here, man!

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.757
- One, two, three.
- Twenty-four.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.831
- One, two, three.
- Twenty-five.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.797
- One, two, three.
- Twenty-six.

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.190
- One, two, three.
- Twenty-seven.

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.872
Twenty-eight.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.871
Twenty-nine.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.235
Thirty.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.951
Mr Benedict...

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.991
...can I come back?

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.276
What was that, Mr Tucker?

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.070
Can I please come back?

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.871
I won't cause you anymore trouble.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.198
I just wanna come back.

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.072
Hi.

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.599
Hey.

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.394
You OK?

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.433
I'm fine.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.153
- I waited for you after band practice.
- I had to work in the yard.

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.470
I left a note with Alan.

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.471
Yeah, I know, I got it.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.517
What's the matter with you?

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.592
People been asking me that
my whole life.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:55.232
I wanna see you.

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.199
I don't think that's such a good idea.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.839
Why not?

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.760
- Jesse?
- 'Cause your father, that's why.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:11.230
Since when do you care
what he thinks about anything?

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.032
- I'm gonna be leaving soon.
- Yeah, I know, and I'm not.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.751
You'll go off to college and I'm gonna
stay and dig ditches for your old man.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.354
I just wanna put in my time
and get out of here.

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:27.635
And go where?

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.869
There's a great spot with a stage...

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.838
You don't get it, do you?
You don't get it.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.275
Every time I hit,
they hit me back harder.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:40.352
- When I start to trust somebody...
- You can trust me.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.431
And you're leaving, aren't you?

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.997
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.594
Always a great pleasure
this time of year

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:08.356
to introduce the Benedict Home
for Boys Band!

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.073
I'll be back.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.799
All right.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.437
Cuff him.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.436
- I'll see ya.
- Let's go.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.311
One, two, three, four. Whoo!

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.433
Alright!

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:06.750
What the hell's going on?

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.111
Come on, get up!

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.593
- You hear that kid?
- Yeah, I hear him.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.070
All right, that's it, kids.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:19.953
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:29.509
Yeah!
