00:29.963 --> 00:31.065
You know what?

00:31.165 --> 00:32.342
Our movie's got to have
a beautiful happy ending.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.735
It's gotta be unpredictable,
like a fun indie vibe;

00:34.835 --> 00:36.537
Black and white; Lens flare.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.148
It's got to have lens
flare, let's not forget.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.350
A tentative title I'm thinking
right now... you tell me what

00:40.374 --> 00:43.844
you think... is "Cold Dreams."

00:43.944 --> 00:44.778
Hey.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.247
Hey, what'd I just say?

00:46.347 --> 00:47.181
What's the title of my work?

00:47.281 --> 00:47.881
Eddie!

00:47.981 --> 00:49.717
Are you listening to me?

00:49.817 --> 00:51.519
I've got gas.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.254
You got your anti-acids?

00:53.354 --> 00:55.723
No.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.292
All right, beautiful, OK.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.793
Maybe you'll come back soon?

00:59.893 --> 01:01.329
And she's gone.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.763
What is that?

01:02.863 --> 01:04.098
This?

01:04.197 --> 01:05.498
Female sanitary appliance.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.235
The elite bodyguards
all carry them.

01:07.335 --> 01:08.469
You want to know why?

01:08.569 --> 01:10.871
The second you start
bleeding, I pop this shit in.

01:10.971 --> 01:11.805
Blood stops.

01:11.905 --> 01:12.606
It stops the bleeding.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.609
I can save you goddamn life.

01:15.709 --> 01:16.920
And get rid of the
comic book also.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.388
She's going to be here
in like five minutes.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.412
Hey.

01:23.751 --> 01:24.952
Hello.

01:25.052 --> 01:26.254
I'm slightly early.

01:26.354 --> 01:27.087
Is it Katherine?

01:27.188 --> 01:27.788
Yeah.

01:27.888 --> 01:28.556
Take a seat.

01:28.656 --> 01:29.666
You want something to eat?

01:29.690 --> 01:30.700
Some lunch would
be... would be nice.

01:30.724 --> 01:31.901
Well, we make an
incredible hot dog.

01:31.925 --> 01:32.360
What do you say?

01:32.460 --> 01:33.093
Yeah.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.462
Yeah.

01:34.562 --> 01:37.165
Hey, man, let me get a hot dog,
soda, and fries, por favor.

01:37.265 --> 01:37.931
Diet orange soda.

01:38.031 --> 01:38.699
Diet orange soda.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.034
You got it.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.135
What are these?

01:45.173 --> 01:46.674
I think those are
the steaks, Louie.

01:46.774 --> 01:47.808
No shit, genius.

01:47.908 --> 01:50.211
Why did you pull them
out of the freezer?

01:50.311 --> 01:51.351
It's for the dinner crowd.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.022
No, you're not supposed
to use these, ass wipe.

01:53.046 --> 01:56.150
You're supposed to use the
one in storage next door.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.694
Manny, put these steaks
back in the freezer.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.821
Get me 20 sirloins
from storage next door.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.065
What's the matter with you, huh?

02:02.089 --> 02:03.757
You're shit for
brains, I told you.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.726
I told you what
steaks to sell here.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.504
One more time, both of
you, I'm gonna violate

02:07.528 --> 02:08.329
you to your parole officer.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.263
You hear me?

02:09.363 --> 02:09.997
You'll be upstate
in a heartbeat.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.332
You got it?

02:11.432 --> 02:12.642
Hey, credit card machine
is still on the fritz, Louie.

02:12.666 --> 02:13.877
Yeah, well, you keep
taking cash till it's fixed.

02:13.901 --> 02:14.901
Yeah.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.378
As you know.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.198
I'm so sorry, there's
so much in your mouth.

02:30.117 --> 02:34.154
As you know, you were
recommended to me by Thomas.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.757
Tresham, client of mine.

02:36.857 --> 02:37.325
Who?

02:37.425 --> 02:38.425
British Tommy.

02:38.459 --> 02:39.693
Oh, Tommy.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.529
He recommended you highly.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.330
Client how?

02:42.430 --> 02:44.432
I was his lawyer in London.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.532
You're a lawyer?

02:48.436 --> 02:52.273
An item will be delivered
at a location next week.

02:52.373 --> 02:56.277
I want you to intercept the
delivery and bring it to me.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.778
Yeah, we can do that, baby.

03:00.481 --> 03:05.219
The man making the
exchange has guards.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.388
He will meet and exchange
the package with others.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.488
Fee is $20,000 each.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.092
Well, the going
rate's $30,000 each.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.595
I'm not going to go
higher than $20,000.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.839
That's inclusive
of two passports.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.464
Hey, wait a minute.

03:16.564 --> 03:17.831
Gig's not here?

03:17.931 --> 03:19.833
No, it's in London next week.

03:19.933 --> 03:24.171
Next... you came all the way
from London, England for us?

03:24.272 --> 03:25.973
This isn't really my field.

03:26.073 --> 03:31.144
Mr. Tresham is my sole
contact in this area.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.480
Well, that's tough luck.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.182
Our parole's conditional on us
maintaining employment here.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.826
Plus, your offer's way
too long, especially

03:36.850 --> 03:39.987
if going to jump the pond.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.289
How much do I owe you?

03:41.389 --> 03:42.656
You know what?

03:42.756 --> 03:44.000
There's got to be way we can
work this out, don't you think?

03:44.024 --> 03:45.369
I mean, we haven't even thought
it through for a second.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.553
Maybe we could talk about it.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.998
Is this diner a chain?

03:51.098 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, a real
shitty, shitty chain.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.370
If I can sort out your parole
issues and this establishment,

03:56.470 --> 03:58.739
would you agree to the
venture at my price?

03:58.839 --> 04:00.341
Knock yourself out.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.675
Uh, break's over ladies.

04:01.775 --> 04:02.775
Uh, Louie?

04:02.810 --> 04:03.810
Yes, darling.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.182
Hm.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.918
You buy cheap stock...

04:11.018 --> 04:13.921
Steaks, on this occasion,
with your own money,

04:14.021 --> 04:15.623
and you store them next door.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.762
If 20 steaks are ordered,
you serve the cheap steaks

04:17.791 --> 04:19.303
you bought, not the
ones on the premises

04:19.327 --> 04:20.567
that are bought by the company.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.971
You don't fix the
credit card machine,

04:21.995 --> 04:22.863
so everyone pays in cash.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.203
You keep the cash for yourself.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.842
If head office get suspicious
and checks the stock,

04:25.866 --> 04:27.801
they'll find it's all
still here on the premises

04:27.901 --> 04:29.537
in the freezer unused.

04:29.637 --> 04:32.873
And it's all very illegal.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.675
Eddie's going away for a week.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.310
He's gonna be
with his friend Paul.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.379
Yes, with Paul.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.280
You're going to call
their parole officer,

04:40.381 --> 04:42.258
say you're sending them
away on a catering course,

04:42.282 --> 04:43.660
as they're doing so
well, and that they'll

04:43.684 --> 04:44.818
be unable to attend.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.287
Otherwise, I'm going to
call head office, tell them

04:47.388 --> 04:49.957
about your illegal activities,
which I assure you will

04:50.057 --> 04:51.158
result in your prosecution.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.893
Do we have an agreement?

04:59.700 --> 05:02.403
Hey, Louie, you're a
disgrace to the restaurant

05:02.503 --> 05:04.405
business, you fuckin' skunk.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.139
Katherine, we're in.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.517
- No, we're not in.
- We're not in.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.275
We're not in yet.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.577
$30,000 each or no deal.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.478
$20,000 and no higher.

05:10.578 --> 05:11.645
$30,000.

05:11.745 --> 05:12.413
You need me.

05:12.513 --> 05:12.913
Us.

05:13.013 --> 05:13.447
Us.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.848
Yeah.

05:14.948 --> 05:15.649
Agreed.

05:15.749 --> 05:16.316
Fuck yeah.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.786
On one condition...

05:18.886 --> 05:20.187
No one gets harmed.

05:20.287 --> 05:24.257
If it's them or us, I know who
I'm choosing there, princess.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.358
Don't call me that.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.161
Yoga?

06:06.133 --> 06:08.335
You look healthy.

06:08.436 --> 06:11.171
I've been meaning to say
for the past few days.

06:11.271 --> 06:13.741
I do tai chi myself.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.909
It's a soft martial art.

06:16.009 --> 06:20.013
Keeps me supple.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.582
He does look
good, though, right?

06:21.682 --> 06:22.483
You do look good.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.250
You do look good.

06:23.350 --> 06:24.350
Cardio, that's what I do.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.887
A panic attack
doesn't count as cardio.

06:26.987 --> 06:27.987
Whatever.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.356
Hey, you know what, Corny?

06:29.457 --> 06:31.167
What do you say after this, we
talk about your acting career?

06:31.191 --> 06:32.325
I'd be delighted to.

06:32.426 --> 06:33.561
You ever tried the boards?

06:33.661 --> 06:35.062
No, my good man.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.363
I'm actually a film producer.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.698
Ah.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.266
Can I just say
what a pleasure it is

06:39.366 --> 06:40.568
to be working with you again?

06:40.668 --> 06:41.945
I hope I didn't
inconvenience you

06:41.969 --> 06:43.871
in requesting you
come to London,

06:43.971 --> 06:47.941
but I couldn't think
of anyone I trust more.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.578
Tommy, I don't
think we need the silencer.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.638
If this shit hits the fan,
the louder, the better.

06:52.713 --> 06:53.781
You know what I mean?

06:53.881 --> 06:56.016
Take it off, please.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.417
The louder, the better.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.686
That's so wise.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.171
What the?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.271
Hey, man!

07:49.102 --> 07:50.638
Why don't you like kitty cats?

07:50.738 --> 07:52.305
Because dogs are better.

07:52.405 --> 07:53.405
Dogs aren't better.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.708
They're more independent.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.143
Hand up, motherfucker.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.643
Put your fucking
hands up right now.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.823
Hands in the air...
There's a good chap...

07:59.847 --> 08:01.807
Or those lovely long
eyelashes will close forever.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.050
Come here. Come.

08:03.150 --> 08:03.517
Come on. Come on.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.317
Come on.

08:04.417 --> 08:05.085
Come, come, come, come.

08:05.185 --> 08:05.719
Drop the bag.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.220
Drop the bag.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.656
Drop the fuckin' bag.

08:08.756 --> 08:09.422
Do what he says.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.759
The guys a fucking maniac.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.460
Kick it over to him.

08:13.561 --> 08:14.561
Kick it over to me.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.595
Kick it over, man.

08:15.663 --> 08:16.564
Nobody needs to get hurt.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.807
OK, kick it over
to me right now.

08:17.831 --> 08:18.975
Kick it over to me right now.

08:18.999 --> 08:19.999
Are you fucking serious?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.902
Come on, guys,
stop fucking around.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.082
Are you fucking kidding me?

08:23.170 --> 08:24.037
What are you, a fucking...

08:24.137 --> 08:24.838
What do I do?

08:24.938 --> 08:25.606
Pick it up.

08:25.706 --> 08:26.540
I'm going to pick it up.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.684
But nobody's going
to fucking move.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.828
Do you hear me? Nobody move.

08:28.876 --> 08:29.442
Nobody fucking move.

08:29.543 --> 08:30.143
I'm gonna pick it up.

08:30.243 --> 08:30.978
Pick it up.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.479
Nobody fucking move. OK.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.580
Keep the gun on him.

08:57.805 --> 08:58.805
Ugh.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.082
Hey, hey, hey.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.083
Stay where you are.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.084
Oh, all right.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.052
Right.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.787
Calm down. Easy.

09:13.887 --> 09:14.588
Hey. Hey.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.122
Hey.

09:15.222 --> 09:15.689
Stay back.

09:15.789 --> 09:16.556
Game over, man.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.557
- It's over.
- Stay back.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.292
Just chill out, man.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.392
Hey, hey, hey, wait.

09:20.427 --> 09:21.294
Easy. Easy.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.394
Easy.

09:31.872 --> 09:32.872
Shit.

09:36.810 --> 09:37.810
Shit.

09:40.313 --> 09:41.313
Shit.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.185
Shit.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.188
Let's go. Let's go.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.189
- Let's go.
- Get it.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.299
Get it.
Let's get the hell out of here.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.591
Let's go!

09:51.692 --> 09:52.159
Let's go!

09:52.259 --> 09:52.993
Go!

09:53.093 --> 09:57.698
Oh, hey there, all.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.569
All ticketed, chaps?

10:02.670 --> 10:04.110
Let's go.
Let's diggity-fuckin'-boot.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.038
Oh, yes.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.306
Hold on here.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.075
Just, uh, reverse, first.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.076
OK, OK. Um.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.044
Drive the fucking car!

10:11.144 --> 10:12.145
OK, calm down.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.082
I hear the leaves in the trees

10:15.182 --> 10:19.152
as they rustle in
the breeze up above.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.402
My name's Dino O'Lynn and this
one's for Deacon and the lads.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.427
Shout out, lads.

10:27.527 --> 10:28.929
Yes, Dino.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.530
Gold.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.466
Bravo, Dino!

10:33.566 --> 10:35.869
OK, from the top.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.504
The Americans stole the bag.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.206
They'll give it to
that cow tomorrow.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.373
What do you do then?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.542
Once we see the exchange,
that's when we move.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.814
We take the bag and
anything else, no prisoners.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.615
What don't you do?

10:48.716 --> 10:49.616
Look inside the bag.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.318
Straight after you get the bag,

10:51.418 --> 10:52.853
you goes to this address.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.187
Call me.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.188
Sit tight.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.389
No other calls.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.693
You don't leave for food,
smokes, girls, nothing.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.829
You wait for me.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.334
Oy, Billy Ray Cyrus,
how many times have I told you

11:07.434 --> 11:10.437
to fix that bloody door, hm?

11:10.537 --> 11:12.139
Fix it!

11:12.239 --> 11:15.608
Dexter and I are going upstairs
for a business meeting.

11:15.709 --> 11:16.443
Do not call me.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.078
Do not disturb me.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.612
Hand over a bottle of red.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.082
Come on!

11:22.182 --> 11:25.018
Evening, Mrs. Bradshaw.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.854
Fuck off, George.

11:26.954 --> 11:30.791
You stink of ketchup and farts.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.527
More business, Mom?

11:34.627 --> 11:36.463
Did you book the
tickets to Barbados?

11:36.563 --> 11:37.164
No.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.365
Do it!

11:38.465 --> 11:41.134
I'm not gonna spend all
year in this fucking dump.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.135
Look at it.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.071
I gave birth to a
fucking haircut.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.808
Just like his fucking dad.

11:47.908 --> 11:51.411
Doesn't he look silly boys, eh?

11:51.511 --> 11:52.880
Eh?

11:52.980 --> 11:53.980
Fucking stupid.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.963
Change of plan.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.464
I'm going with you.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.733
You stay here, lock up.

12:16.703 --> 12:19.439
You two, come with me.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.445
We ain't open.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.054
Scrambled eggs on toast, $2.95.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.823
You're a troublemaker.

12:35.923 --> 12:39.326
Plain omelet, $3.95.

12:39.426 --> 12:44.331
Oy, mullethead, was is
it, double denim day, yeah?

12:44.431 --> 12:48.601
This jacket was me dad's.

12:48.701 --> 12:51.371
You want to bring your
dad down here, yeah?

12:51.471 --> 12:52.806
I'd take you and your dad.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.142
Huh.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.844
My dad's dead.

12:56.944 --> 12:57.944
Good.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.819
Yeah.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.321
OK.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.421
That's right.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.600
You all right?

13:20.700 --> 13:23.136
I had a bunch of queers trying
it on just a minute ago.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.236
Ah!

13:34.014 --> 13:37.017
I've lost a button.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.920
I've lost a button.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.288
Get some aprons on.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.098
Wakey, wakey.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.901
Rise and shine, Hong Kong Fui.

13:54.001 --> 13:54.567
Come on.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.667
There's a good lad.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.549
Show me a room where
I can lock you in.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.309
There's a pantry just...

14:02.409 --> 14:04.611
Just down... just down there.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.191
Mind your hair when
you go down there.

14:10.217 --> 14:13.386
I meant your
head, not your hair on there.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.722
My dad had his hair like this.

14:15.822 --> 14:16.924
I love your dad.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.334
I wish he was still
alive, your dad.

14:18.358 --> 14:18.791
Hey, I...

14:18.892 --> 14:19.559
Shh.

14:19.659 --> 14:20.260
I didn't mean it.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.360
I wasn't... I was a...

14:31.704 --> 14:32.704
I'll have a coffee.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.314
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bow.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.689
All right, all cool.

14:49.789 --> 14:52.159
And you think a person thrown
and killed from a great height

14:52.259 --> 14:53.259
is all cool?

14:53.326 --> 14:54.603
That was... that was unavoidable.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.405
You can't... that was... by
the way, he even tripped.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.464
It wasn't even...

14:57.564 --> 14:58.098
- That's an act of God.
- You can't do anything.

14:58.198 --> 14:58.865
You're a lawyer.

14:58.966 --> 14:59.832
You know about that.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.768
I assumed you
were professionals.

15:01.868 --> 15:02.435
Oh, I'm so sorry.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.136
We are professional.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.337
What did you just say?

15:04.437 --> 15:06.940
We had an agreement...
No one seriously injured.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.642
Cut the shit, and hand over
our cash, you little brat.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.078
Come on, give me my money.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.484
Christ, what is
this, a Mary Poppins bag?

15:24.291 --> 15:25.092
What the fuck is this?

15:25.192 --> 15:25.792
It's short.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.227
It's fucking way short.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.661
Well, the agreement was

15:28.761 --> 15:31.331
$30,000 each and no
one seriously hurt,

15:31.431 --> 15:32.799
but you didn't adhere to that.

15:32.899 --> 15:36.469
So as a penalty, it drops to my
original offer of $20,000 each.

15:36.569 --> 15:37.569
Are you...

15:39.839 --> 15:41.408
I'll tell you what.

15:41.508 --> 15:45.245
You take the hamburger, and
I'll take the filet mignon.

15:46.746 --> 15:47.347
Give it to me.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.248
- No.
- Give it to me.

15:48.348 --> 15:48.948
No.

15:49.049 --> 15:49.549
Give it to me.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.117
Ugh.

15:50.217 --> 15:50.683
Give it to me.

15:50.783 --> 15:51.118
Just give it.

15:51.218 --> 15:51.618
Come on.

15:51.718 --> 15:52.219
Come on.

15:52.319 --> 15:52.719
No.

15:52.819 --> 15:53.853
Thank you.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.213
What was that?

16:20.313 --> 16:20.880
Watch her.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.015
Watch the rucksack.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.416
Don't move.

16:23.516 --> 16:24.184
Don't fucking move.

16:24.284 --> 16:24.751
Watch her good.

16:24.851 --> 16:25.851
You hear me?

16:37.730 --> 16:39.932
Who's the dead
dude in the kitchen?

16:40.033 --> 16:40.467
What?

16:40.567 --> 16:41.734
Yeah.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.203
Who's the dead dude
in the kitchen?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.404
I know nothing about that.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.824
Who the fuck
are these two people?

16:45.872 --> 16:48.975
I don't know.

16:49.076 --> 16:49.476
Come on.

16:49.576 --> 16:50.043
Come on.

16:50.143 --> 16:50.610
See, it's OK.

16:50.710 --> 16:51.978
Just tell us.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.122
You wanted them to take care
of us and then keep the money.

16:53.146 --> 16:53.913
Is that it?

16:54.013 --> 16:54.814
No.

16:54.914 --> 16:55.382
Don't move.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.015
Stop.

16:56.116 --> 16:56.783
Who's the bag for?

16:56.883 --> 16:57.684
That's not your concern.

16:57.784 --> 16:58.994
Yes, it is our fucking concern.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.254
Someone tries kill us,
it's our concern, princess.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.865
- Stop calling me that.
- Everyone makes mistakes.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.267
I wanna... can I talk
to you in private...

17:04.290 --> 17:06.559
In private, just you and
me, just talking in private?

17:07.660 --> 17:08.428
Don't look.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.296
Look away for one second.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.297
We're gonna talk for a second.

17:10.396 --> 17:11.464
It's OK, just...

17:11.564 --> 17:13.633
Do you have any idea
what's inside this bag?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.867
Kitty cats? I don't know.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.270
No, no, not kitty cats...

17:17.369 --> 17:21.973
Bearer bonds, about $800,000...
$800 fucking thousand.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.542
She didn't tell us that.

17:23.643 --> 17:24.752
What the fuck will
we do with them?

17:24.777 --> 17:26.613
We fence the bonds, get
the fuck out of dodge.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.057
What are we still
doing here, right?

17:28.080 --> 17:29.925
Better to be on the run with
a ton of money than nothing

17:29.949 --> 17:30.959
at all. Can you hear that?

17:30.983 --> 17:31.884
Yeah, she's...

17:31.984 --> 17:32.652
She can fucking hear everything.

17:32.752 --> 17:33.586
Use your indoor voice.

17:33.686 --> 17:34.587
OK, this is it for me.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.324
What do you think, fence it?

17:37.424 --> 17:41.561
You think she
knew about these guys?

17:52.805 --> 17:53.406
Where did she go?

17:53.506 --> 17:54.741
Where's the rucksack?

18:17.897 --> 18:18.965
Katherine.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.065
Arkady.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.634
What a surprise.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.137
Would you like some, uh,
breakfast, uh, coffee,

18:24.237 --> 18:24.837
croissant?

18:24.937 --> 18:26.739
Ah, I shouldn't.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.512
Well, tell us what happened.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.914
I waited for the Americans
to collect the bonds.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.849
Uh, they did.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.957
Two men arrived.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.793
They attacked us.

18:46.893 --> 18:47.893
She's lying.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.507
The Americans fought them off.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.333
I managed to slip
away with the bag.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.035
Ugly cow is lying.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.771
Why would my
men do such a thing?

18:58.871 --> 19:00.373
Continue.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.142
I still have the
Americans' money.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.453
I think it's best
if we pay them off.

19:04.477 --> 19:08.047
They've done nothing wrong.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.984
Well, thank you
for all your help.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.753
You are now debt-free.

19:13.853 --> 19:17.657
I'll be sorry
to lose your services.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.692
So I can pay the Americans off?

19:19.792 --> 19:23.196
No, we'll take care of
the Americans ourselves.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.297
Why take a chance?

19:24.397 --> 19:27.567
Just... just
tell us where they are.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.806
As your legal advisor,

19:33.906 --> 19:35.375
I think it's best
if we don't add

19:35.475 --> 19:38.177
murder to your current issues.

19:38.278 --> 19:42.882
And, um, I don't want
to be an accessory.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.917
Are you asking me for a favor?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.653
A favor that's in your interest.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.489
Well, if I do this favor
for you, it'll mean you still

19:49.589 --> 19:50.589
owe me the same amount.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.024
The debt would be back on.

19:52.124 --> 19:55.027
That's not fair.

19:55.127 --> 19:58.164
I've done everything that...

19:58.265 --> 20:03.102
Fine.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.886
Bastard fuck.

20:19.986 --> 20:20.986
Fuck it!

20:25.958 --> 20:30.330
I'm going to choose to
believe that you sent your two

20:30.430 --> 20:32.665
men to simply collect the
bonds, as I instructed,

20:32.765 --> 20:36.336
but then, they took
it upon themselves

20:36.436 --> 20:39.472
to attack the Americans
and take everything

20:39.572 --> 20:40.740
without your knowledge.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.909
No, no, no, no.

20:43.009 --> 20:46.145
I'm choosing to believe you
had nothing to do with it.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.347
Arkady, I swear on my...

20:51.250 --> 20:53.353
I swear on my mother's...

21:09.836 --> 21:17.836
Deacon, you repulsive testicle,

21:18.778 --> 21:23.516
those two mean of yours
will show up somewhere.

21:31.858 --> 21:32.858
Mm.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.630
I'm going to meet your
friends downstairs.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.499
You stay here till I get back.

21:39.599 --> 21:43.302
Do not move from this spot.

21:43.403 --> 21:44.103
Piggy, yeah?

21:44.203 --> 21:46.539
Come on.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.409
Come with me.

21:57.183 --> 21:59.586
Two large baguettes.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.609
Chicks, you know what I mean?

22:56.709 --> 23:00.580
Chicks shapeshifting.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.815
At least we'll be back
in the US tomorrow, right?

23:02.915 --> 23:06.085
Out of this shithole
of a fucking country.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.185
Yeah, that's right.

23:11.891 --> 23:12.324
Hello?

23:12.425 --> 23:13.292
Who's that?

23:13.392 --> 23:15.428
Yeah, fine.

23:15.528 --> 23:18.197
Fucking fine.

23:18.297 --> 23:19.699
It was Katherine.

23:19.799 --> 23:20.667
She's on her way up.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.268
Tommy must have
told where we were.

23:22.368 --> 23:24.637
You let her up
here now, right now?

23:24.737 --> 23:26.038
Yeah.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.174
Right... of
course you let her up.

23:28.274 --> 23:29.709
You're a genius.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.277
That's awesome.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.583
Coming to take
more of our money?

23:36.683 --> 23:39.318
Because we don't have
any more, thanks to you.

23:39.418 --> 23:44.023
I came to explain and apologize.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.424
Apologize?

23:45.525 --> 23:47.093
For stabbing us in the back?

23:47.193 --> 23:47.827
I saves your life.

23:47.927 --> 23:48.595
How do you...

23:48.695 --> 23:50.229
Will you let me explain?

23:50.329 --> 23:52.732
Arkady is the man who
organized the job.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.201
I owed him a substantial
amount of money.

23:55.301 --> 23:57.804
Getting you to steal the bonds
was how I'd pay him back.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.544
Well, we're delighted
you're off the hook.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.173
Arkady wanted you both dead.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.410
I convinced him not to
do it but at great cost.

24:04.511 --> 24:07.046
I am now back in debt to him.

24:07.146 --> 24:11.584
One of his people, an animal
by the name of Deacon Bradshaw,

24:11.684 --> 24:13.686
sent those two men
to steal everything.

24:13.786 --> 24:14.906
I think you're full of shit.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.599
Well, I think you were
going to sell the bonds,

24:16.623 --> 24:18.090
leaving me at Arkady's mercy.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.190
Oh, you don't know...

24:19.258 --> 24:20.302
Arkady's planning something.

24:20.326 --> 24:21.327
- Who cares?
- I care.

24:21.427 --> 24:21.828
I do.

24:21.928 --> 24:22.762
I care.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.363
Arkady and Deacon met three men

24:24.463 --> 24:29.569
involved with him previously,
serious armed robbers.

24:29.669 --> 24:32.505
Something big is happening.

24:32.605 --> 24:35.474
I thought that, um,
it might be something

24:35.575 --> 24:39.078
we could take advantage of,
capitalize on, all of us.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.347
Ah, that's why she came
back, not to apologize.

24:41.447 --> 24:41.848
Come on.

24:41.948 --> 24:43.049
Let's go.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.584
Let's go, honey.

24:44.684 --> 24:45.384
Let's go. Come on.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.484
Let's go.

24:49.622 --> 24:50.622
It's a no.

24:56.062 --> 24:58.130
You're here illegally
with forged passports.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.365
You violated your parole.

24:59.465 --> 25:01.634
You've committed the
robbery and a murder.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.214
If the police were
informed, you spend

25:03.302 --> 25:04.647
the rest of your life
locked up, probably

25:04.671 --> 25:08.040
never see your country again.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.742
You threatening me?

25:09.842 --> 25:13.012
You're in this just as
much as we are, princess.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.381
I'm not involved
in the slightest.

25:15.481 --> 25:19.218
And whatever you say, they'll
believe me over a pair

25:19.318 --> 25:20.953
of convicted criminals.

25:21.053 --> 25:24.156
Oh, and let's not forget
the museum CCTV footage of

25:24.256 --> 25:28.494
your recent shambolic endeavor.

25:28.595 --> 25:31.664
You know, I think they'll
be able to match your faces,

25:31.764 --> 25:37.770
despite your mastery of
disguise with baseball caps.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.138
Oh, no, I think they worked.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.040
They were shit.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.842
I'll be upstairs in
the bar for 15 minutes.

25:42.942 --> 25:43.942
Excuse me.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.352
What's shambolic?

25:53.452 --> 25:55.121
What the fuck is wrong with you?

25:55.221 --> 25:56.431
What's wrong with me?
What are you talking about?

25:56.455 --> 25:57.456
It's a no?

25:57.556 --> 25:58.667
You said it's a no like
five fucking times.

25:58.691 --> 25:59.258
It's a no.

25:59.358 --> 26:00.092
It's a no?

26:00.192 --> 26:01.093
She could call the cops on us.

26:01.193 --> 26:01.861
She could... calm down.

26:01.961 --> 26:02.729
Lower your fucking voice.

26:02.829 --> 26:04.463
She could call the cops on us.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.041
We're going to listen
to what she has to say.

26:06.065 --> 26:06.899
What are you wearing?

26:06.999 --> 26:07.867
Are you... what are
you Ron Jeremy?

26:07.967 --> 26:09.377
This is what...
This is what I wear...

26:09.401 --> 26:10.236
Please, God.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.413
When I get out of the shower,

26:11.437 --> 26:12.648
and I don't want to put
on pants, and I want

26:12.672 --> 26:14.340
to feel like a goddamn man.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.842
Please take that off.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.210
In the name of baby Jesus,
take that thing off.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.354
I am so sorry. What is this?

26:19.378 --> 26:20.378
You put on a shirt?

26:20.446 --> 26:21.489
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:21.513 --> 26:23.515
Are you trying to
look pretty for someone?

26:23.616 --> 26:24.483
Is it for me?

26:24.583 --> 26:25.351
Do you want to
look pretty for me?

26:25.451 --> 26:26.152
Maybe.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.292
No, I don't think it's me.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.059
Hello, handsome.

26:40.900 --> 26:41.900
You all right, lads?

26:45.772 --> 26:47.974
How's the knee?

26:48.074 --> 26:48.908
Better.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.409
Looks fantastic.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.886
You?

26:59.986 --> 27:01.988
I think I need a dentist.

27:02.088 --> 27:05.291
We're sorry about
everything, sir.

27:05.391 --> 27:06.391
It's not a problem.

27:06.425 --> 27:07.526
You kept quiet, yeah?

27:07.626 --> 27:08.194
Not a word.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.996
Shut up ever since.

27:10.096 --> 27:10.663
You are?

27:10.763 --> 27:11.763
Yeah.

27:14.200 --> 27:18.037
Well, we're gonna get you
a doctor, get you a dentist...

27:18.137 --> 27:23.743
Dentist, give you some cash,
send you away somewhere.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.345
Get some sun till
things die down.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.347
How would your fancy Spain?

27:28.447 --> 27:30.582
Sounds good, boss.

27:30.683 --> 27:32.384
You two hungry?

27:32.484 --> 27:33.085
Fish and chips?

27:33.185 --> 27:35.421
Yeah.

27:35.521 --> 27:37.223
Can I have a private word?

27:37.323 --> 27:38.323
Yeah.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.561
Be back in a jiffy.

27:45.597 --> 27:48.234
Chips and curry sauce.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.337
Shishkabob.

27:51.437 --> 27:52.437
Mush and peas.

27:53.405 --> 27:54.405
Ugh.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.277
Please.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.246
Please, Deacon, Please.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.247
Shh.

28:01.347 --> 28:01.814
Please.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.215
Please, Deacon.

28:03.315 --> 28:04.315
Please.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.726
We get in there, you
let me do the talking, OK?

28:13.826 --> 28:14.727
- You got it.
- I got this.

28:14.827 --> 28:15.561
You're gonna give me the ball.

28:15.661 --> 28:16.362
You're the captain.

28:16.462 --> 28:17.229
I know exactly what to say.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.130
Run like OJ.

28:18.230 --> 28:18.831
- Yes.
- Take.

28:18.931 --> 28:19.931
Off your glasses.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.535
We're not going to do it.

28:23.635 --> 28:25.071
Do you want me
to call the police?

28:25.171 --> 28:26.038
Yeah, go ahead.

28:26.138 --> 28:26.906
Good luck with
everything, hambone,

28:27.006 --> 28:28.206
because we're not gonna do it.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.845
What is it that you want?

28:32.945 --> 28:35.014
If we're going to help, whatever

28:35.114 --> 28:36.154
you got already planned...

28:36.215 --> 28:37.893
I know you got something
already planned...

28:37.917 --> 28:39.651
We want 80%, not 50%.

28:39.752 --> 28:40.953
80%, not 50-50.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.088
Do you understand?

28:42.188 --> 28:43.389
Not 50-50.

28:43.489 --> 28:44.323
That's not fair.

28:44.423 --> 28:45.567
What do you mean it's not fair?

28:45.591 --> 28:47.035
We're not here to
bargain with you, princess.

28:47.059 --> 28:47.526
You need me.

28:47.626 --> 28:48.027
Us.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.428
Us.

28:49.528 --> 28:51.097
A moment to process
this information.

28:51.197 --> 28:52.197
Take your moment.

28:56.936 --> 29:01.273
Are you do... is it happening?

29:01.373 --> 29:02.474
20% will be sufficient.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.309
Yes!

29:03.409 --> 29:04.586
20... sorry, 20% will be good.

29:04.610 --> 29:07.013
All right, when this
is finished, I'm gone.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.314
This is... I'm done.

29:08.414 --> 29:09.681
You understand?

29:09.782 --> 29:11.050
I'm out of here.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.295
That means I'm getting on a jet
plane, going across the pond

29:13.319 --> 29:14.186
back to where I belong.

29:14.286 --> 29:15.421
You understand?

29:15.521 --> 29:16.188
You got me?

29:16.288 --> 29:17.288
Do you copy that?

29:17.356 --> 29:20.026
She got it.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.527
80%.

29:21.627 --> 29:23.595
Pineapple.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.666
All right, chop, chop.

29:30.669 --> 29:33.705
Great to be working
with you again, Eddie.

29:37.709 --> 29:38.911
Right.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.446
Sorry, could you concentrate?

29:40.546 --> 29:41.948
Yeah.

29:42.048 --> 29:45.317
Across this street
is Deacon's pub.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.920
He lives there with
every illegal activity

29:48.020 --> 29:49.488
that Arkady funds through it.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.958
I suggest that we
monitor it, follow him

29:52.058 --> 29:54.226
and his associates from here.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.004
Our entrance is on a
completely different street.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.696
Deacon won't see
us come in or out.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.166
Our base... we'll live here.

30:00.266 --> 30:02.601
What's that smell?

30:05.637 --> 30:06.438
Oh, sorry.

30:06.538 --> 30:07.538
Ugh.

30:10.409 --> 30:11.878
Good?

30:11.978 --> 30:12.544
Makes sense.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.279
I like it.

30:13.379 --> 30:14.379
Dart board, I dig it.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.614
What are you fucking crazy?

30:15.714 --> 30:16.916
This mural's amazing.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.660
- This place is a shit hole.
- We've got a lot of space.

30:18.684 --> 30:19.684
I like...

30:19.751 --> 30:20.929
They're painting
over the fucking feces.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.154
You don't even smell that?

30:22.254 --> 30:24.094
Smells like a gorilla
shit in his head and then

30:24.123 --> 30:25.700
ate it and then shit
again on the ground.

30:25.724 --> 30:27.102
You better get me a
hotel, because I'm

30:27.126 --> 30:28.126
not fucking staying here.

30:28.160 --> 30:28.727
Yeah, good.

30:28.827 --> 30:29.661
Um, I've rented it.

30:29.761 --> 30:32.664
There's food here in the fridge.

30:32.764 --> 30:34.566
Bedding's in the other room.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.434
Toiletries...

30:35.534 --> 30:37.403
What the fuck is this?

30:37.503 --> 30:39.305
You expect us to use
this cheap, waxy shit?

30:39.405 --> 30:40.748
Well, if you want
more expensive items,

30:40.772 --> 30:42.484
you'll have to pay for
them out of your pocket.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.077
Now, as we're all
participating equally,

30:45.177 --> 30:47.179
but I'm the sole person
who's forwarding funds,

30:47.279 --> 30:50.816
I will want my share of
these purchase and the rent

30:50.917 --> 30:52.218
on successful completion.

30:52.318 --> 30:57.189
I've got an itemized bill with
receipts of my spend so far.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.091
You are going to need
surveillance items.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.960
Please list them,
but no purchases

31:01.060 --> 31:03.295
will be made until everyone's
given the all-clear.

31:03.395 --> 31:04.395
Agreed?

31:06.765 --> 31:14.765
Nice... nice..

31:22.614 --> 31:24.016
Is that what you call them, ??

31:24.116 --> 31:24.750
- Unique.
- Yes.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.152
Crazy.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.720
What if I do this like that, go
in there, Hong Kong Fu... ugh.

31:28.820 --> 31:31.323
Interrupt me again, and I
will snap your fucking arm off,

31:31.423 --> 31:32.724
Cornelius.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.326
Listen up!

31:34.426 --> 31:37.763
This is my high-end
moisturized toilet paper.

31:37.863 --> 31:39.698
Nobody fuckin' uses it.

31:39.798 --> 31:40.798
Do you understand?

31:40.832 --> 31:41.867
Huh?

31:41.968 --> 31:43.635
Do you fucking understand?

31:56.949 --> 31:58.317
For next week?

31:58.417 --> 32:01.253
Lunch?

32:01.353 --> 32:02.353
Bye.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.659
Um.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.161
Why don't you get some sleep?

32:09.261 --> 32:11.630
It's my shift.

32:11.730 --> 32:12.730
Yeah.

32:34.653 --> 32:38.024
Are always the best.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.025
I'm sorry?

32:39.125 --> 32:40.392
Come again?

32:40.492 --> 32:42.728
In the '60s space race, NASA
were faced with the problem

32:42.828 --> 32:44.830
of inventing a pen for
their astronauts that

32:44.930 --> 32:46.365
would write in zero gravity...

32:46.465 --> 32:49.668
Spent million, eventually came
up with a pen that worked.

32:49.768 --> 32:52.638
The Russians, faced
with the same problem,

32:52.738 --> 32:54.706
gave their cosmonauts a pencil.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.442
Are you a Communist, Katherine?

32:56.542 --> 32:57.776
Hey, dude, come on.

32:57.876 --> 32:59.478
These are fun facts here.

32:59.578 --> 33:01.047
Whether the story
is true or not,

33:01.147 --> 33:04.016
the point is we have spent too
much time on a complex problem

33:04.116 --> 33:06.218
while overlooking the
elegant, a simple solution

33:06.318 --> 33:07.553
that's right before our eyes.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.622
Is that how you figured out
about Louie and the steaks?

33:10.722 --> 33:12.158
Well, that was obvious.

33:12.258 --> 33:13.725
Total moron would've
spotted that.

33:15.727 --> 33:20.299
I bought napkins, you know,
if you want to get a little...

33:20.399 --> 33:22.234
I'm gonna... yeah.

33:30.008 --> 33:30.709
Hey.

33:30.809 --> 33:32.544
My turn.

33:32.644 --> 33:35.047
Any action?

33:35.147 --> 33:38.584
No, nothing.

33:38.684 --> 33:44.156
We know what we are
but not what we may be.

33:44.256 --> 33:45.256
Wow.

33:48.094 --> 33:51.130
Hey, how do you know
Katherine, anyway?

33:51.230 --> 33:53.432
- She's my cousin.
- Really?

33:53.532 --> 33:54.233
Yeah.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.373
Why is she doing all this?

33:55.467 --> 33:57.369
I mean, she's not exactly
the criminal type.

33:57.469 --> 34:01.440
She was working
for a huge law firm.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.875
Then, she met some
chap who convinced

34:03.975 --> 34:06.512
her to give him her life
savings to start a business.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.347
The business was going
under, so he asked

34:08.447 --> 34:11.150
her to get a loan from Arkady.

34:11.250 --> 34:14.853
She did, and the fucker
ran off with the money

34:14.953 --> 34:17.123
and her best friend.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.500
Next thing I know,
she's working solely

34:18.524 --> 34:20.426
for Arkady to pay the debt off.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.793
I tried to track him down,
but it was impossible.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.096
Fucking snapped his neck.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.132
On the porch.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.100
I see him.

34:28.199 --> 34:28.967
I'm on it.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.436
I'm gonna follow him on foot.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.495
My shift.

34:57.094 --> 34:57.829
Yeah.

34:57.929 --> 34:58.697
I actually may go for a walk.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.166
I'm gonna go walk.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.100
Go for a walk real quick.

35:10.909 --> 35:12.043
Hello, darling.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.679
What can I get you?

35:13.779 --> 35:15.781
You can start by
getting me a beer.

35:15.881 --> 35:17.416
You're an American, are you?

35:17.516 --> 35:17.983
Yes, ma'am.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.885
Say that again.

35:19.985 --> 35:22.588
Yes, ma'am.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.502
Well, I work for NASA.

35:36.602 --> 35:37.303
No.

35:37.403 --> 35:38.237
Yes, it's crazy.

35:38.337 --> 35:40.539
Stephen Hawking got me the job.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.174
But anyway, I had
to stop, because I

35:42.274 --> 35:43.475
went on this insane mission.

35:43.575 --> 35:46.278
One time, there was an asteroid
coming to earth, right?

35:46.378 --> 35:47.513
Wow.

35:47.613 --> 35:48.923
But we need to blow it
up, so it doesn't it earth.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.349
We had to split it
into two, right?

35:50.449 --> 35:51.283
But I came...

35:51.383 --> 35:52.527
I'm so tired of
saving the world.

35:52.551 --> 35:53.385
So I was like, you know what?

35:53.485 --> 35:54.686
I'll just produce movies.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.146
- I'm in the arts, you know.
- You?

35:56.222 --> 35:56.755
What do you do?

35:56.855 --> 35:57.256
Mm.

35:57.356 --> 35:57.956
Up there.

35:58.056 --> 36:00.759
My pictures, you see?

36:00.859 --> 36:01.627
You made those.

36:01.727 --> 36:02.861
"Genital Fruits."

36:02.961 --> 36:05.531
"Genital Fruits" is
what you call them.

36:05.631 --> 36:06.932
My name's Dawn, by the way.

36:07.032 --> 36:08.033
Teddy Roosevelt.

36:08.133 --> 36:11.136
Oh, for fuck's sake, Dexter.

36:11.237 --> 36:12.838
Excuse me.

36:12.938 --> 36:14.373
I'm here at the
weekends usually.

36:14.473 --> 36:14.873
Oh yeah?

36:14.973 --> 36:16.608
Mm.

36:16.708 --> 36:17.309
No.

36:17.409 --> 36:18.076
I told you it was over.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.245
Now, off it. Come on.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.270
Good morning.

36:45.304 --> 36:47.306
Top of the morning.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.274
How did your...

36:48.374 --> 36:50.476
Your mission go?

36:50.576 --> 36:51.576
Waste of time.

36:51.643 --> 36:53.412
That bar was busy.

36:53.512 --> 36:54.922
I couldn't understand
their accents, though.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.106
They don't speak like you do.

36:56.181 --> 36:58.684
No, they're old-school
working-class cockneys...

36:58.784 --> 36:59.985
Dying breed.

37:00.085 --> 37:01.453
Kept saying the "C" word.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.054
Cunt.

37:03.154 --> 37:04.155
Yeah.

37:04.256 --> 37:07.493
They kept saying "dog
and bone" and "throw

37:07.593 --> 37:10.228
a pint down my Gregory."

37:10.329 --> 37:11.530
Gregory Peck.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.870
Yeah, throw... throw a beer
down my Gregory Peck... neck.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.000
That's... what is that?

37:15.100 --> 37:17.168
It's rhyming,
Cockney rhyming slang.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.069
Slang?

37:18.169 --> 37:19.169
It's rhymes.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.340
Dog and bone is, um, phone.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.842
Cool. Dog and bone.

37:23.942 --> 37:26.478
Gregory Peck neck.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.780
Hey, mate.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.215
Hey, mate.

37:30.316 --> 37:31.783
Oy, mate.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.018
Oy.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.786
Innit?

37:34.886 --> 37:37.155
Gregory Peck neck, innit...

37:37.255 --> 37:38.255
Innit?

37:38.324 --> 37:39.358
Pretty good, huh?

37:39.458 --> 37:41.360
Uh.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.994
I'll work on it.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.563
Any tips?

37:44.663 --> 37:45.664
Imagine you're chewing

37:45.764 --> 37:47.833
on a sandwich whilst talking.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.835
Right.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.438
Best if we send
Uncle Martin to listen next time

37:52.538 --> 37:54.239
they go to the Hawaiian bar.

38:05.684 --> 38:06.385
- See something?
- No.

38:06.485 --> 38:06.885
No.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.086
No.

38:08.186 --> 38:10.589
Thought there were...
That's, uh... it's my shift.

38:10.689 --> 38:11.689
OK.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.530
Tea, Eddie?

38:18.630 --> 38:20.499
I'm good, thank you.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.323
What are you doing?

38:49.895 --> 38:52.263
Smell, do you?

38:52.364 --> 38:54.766
Smell, do you?

38:54.866 --> 38:58.937
Upon seeing a young lady,
degrading comments are made.

38:59.037 --> 39:03.008
Mickey... "I'd finger
her with all five."

39:03.108 --> 39:07.613
Deacon... "You fucking cunt,
the only thing you've fingered"

39:07.713 --> 39:09.347
is your asshole."

39:09.448 --> 39:12.083
Laughter ensues.

39:12.183 --> 39:15.086
George... "Look
at the tits on it."

39:15.186 --> 39:18.123
I'd bang that whore
till it dropped off."

39:18.223 --> 39:20.626
Milroy Primas...

39:20.726 --> 39:24.596
"I never go down on bad pussy.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.633
Mickey... "I bet
she could swallow"

39:27.733 --> 39:31.637
and fart at the same time."

39:31.737 --> 39:34.272
I have swallow and part.

39:34.372 --> 39:38.744
No, I think it's
"swallow and fart."

39:38.844 --> 39:40.245
Doesn't make sense at all.

39:40.345 --> 39:41.346
I agree.

39:41.447 --> 39:42.914
What wold be the
point of swallowing?

39:43.014 --> 39:44.483
Thank you, Uncle.

39:44.583 --> 39:45.150
Very thorough.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.452
Excellent work.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.454
Not a problem, Thomas.

39:48.554 --> 39:53.559
May I ask, is Mr.
Deacon a herpetologist?

39:53.659 --> 39:54.960
What's that?

39:55.060 --> 39:59.264
Well, it's from the Greek
"herpene," meaning "to creep";

39:59.364 --> 40:03.869
A branch of zoology dealing
with the study of amphibians.

40:03.969 --> 40:05.471
I'm asking because the gentleman

40:05.571 --> 40:09.174
with the extravagant
hairstyle, Deacon,

40:09.274 --> 40:14.613
he kept on repeating,
"Blue Iguana."

40:14.713 --> 40:19.718
Blue Iguana this,
blue Iguana that.

40:19.818 --> 40:25.557
"The money that fat tub of shit,
Arkady, and us will be making

40:25.657 --> 40:29.895
will be fucking orgasmic."

40:29.995 --> 40:35.400
Blue Iguana, it's a diamond.

40:35.501 --> 40:36.935
Sorry, are we... what happened?

40:37.035 --> 40:38.537
Blue Iguana... it's a diamond.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.371
Oh, does it have
magical powers, like it

40:40.472 --> 40:41.673
curses anybody who touches it?

40:41.773 --> 40:42.884
You see what you're going to
look like when you're old?

40:42.908 --> 40:43.909
No, it's just a diamond.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.252
If you look into, do
you see your future?

40:45.276 --> 40:48.514
In the '80s, a Turkish
prince married an Englishwoman.

40:48.614 --> 40:51.817
He purchased the Blue
Iguana as a wedding gift.

40:51.917 --> 40:52.818
He loved her.

40:52.918 --> 40:54.953
But she partied, gambled.

40:55.053 --> 40:56.087
She was too wild for him.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.589
It didn't work.

40:57.689 --> 40:58.689
But wouldn't divorce her.

40:58.724 --> 41:00.526
He went home, sent
her to Switzerland,

41:00.626 --> 41:02.146
provided her with a
few million a year.

41:02.193 --> 41:03.394
My heart bleeds.

41:03.495 --> 41:06.097
A few months ago, I heard
he decided to take her back.

41:06.197 --> 41:07.341
He wants to present
her at a family

41:07.365 --> 41:10.401
gathering wearing the diamond.

41:10.502 --> 41:11.770
So?

41:11.870 --> 41:15.907
So she lost it in a card game
to a man named Jacob Taylor.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.076
Without it, he
won't take her back.

41:18.176 --> 41:20.546
The diamond is kept in a
high-security safety deposit

41:20.646 --> 41:21.713
center.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.157
If Arkady steals the
diamond for the princess,

41:23.181 --> 41:25.483
she'll be welcomed
back and ensure that he

41:25.584 --> 41:28.353
is too, very lucrative for him.

41:28.453 --> 41:30.622
Arkady's tired of
funding Deacon's

41:30.722 --> 41:32.357
illegal activities to survive.

41:32.457 --> 41:34.468
He wants to make a large
amount of money and retire.

41:34.492 --> 41:35.794
Do you know this princess?

41:35.894 --> 41:36.427
Vaguely.

41:36.528 --> 41:37.729
Mm.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.998
Arkady introduced
us, did some work for him.

41:40.098 --> 41:42.109
And how do you propose we get
into this high-tech facility,

41:42.133 --> 41:43.168
huh?

41:43.268 --> 41:44.870
You've got to be juiced
up on the inside.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.572
We know fucking nothing.

41:46.672 --> 41:49.775
They could have security
systems, timers, smart waters,

41:49.875 --> 41:51.610
fucking motion sensor detectors.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.320
They could have all that
shit, and we don't know.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.746
Because we can't fuckin' see.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.014
Don't need to know.

41:56.114 --> 41:57.725
We'll steal it from
Deacon when he steals it,

41:57.749 --> 42:00.485
give it to the princess,
collect the reward.

42:00.586 --> 42:02.320
Simple solution to
a complex problem.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.493
OK.

42:08.594 --> 42:12.130
If that simple solution works,
what do you think she'll pay?

42:12.230 --> 42:15.867
Between $5 million
to $6 million?

42:15.967 --> 42:16.735
And is that pounds or...

42:16.835 --> 42:18.103
No, that's pounds.

42:18.203 --> 42:19.203
That's pounds.

42:23.909 --> 42:26.778
You know, the
other day when I was, uh...

42:26.878 --> 42:29.915
When I went into, uh...

42:30.015 --> 42:33.819
You know, when I tried to...

42:33.919 --> 42:35.787
I wanted to say I was tired.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.122
My head was...

42:37.222 --> 42:38.489
I'm sorry.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.134
And thanks for getting
Arkady off our backs

42:40.158 --> 42:43.762
and saving our lives.

42:43.862 --> 42:48.366
So did anything...

42:48.466 --> 42:50.602
I owe you, OK?

42:50.702 --> 42:53.304
Mm.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.182
After they steal it, how
are they going to this rock

42:55.206 --> 42:56.041
to the princess?

42:56.141 --> 42:57.175
Diamond.

42:57.275 --> 43:01.112
Yeah, the Purple
Serpent or whatever it is.

43:01.212 --> 43:03.181
Well, Arkady can't go
to her in Switzerland

43:03.281 --> 43:04.482
because of various offenses.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.986
So she's either coming here,
or he's sending a courier.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.688
He won't trust a courier.

43:09.788 --> 43:11.432
He's going to want to
give it to her personally.

43:11.456 --> 43:14.325
If we find out
when she's coming,

43:14.425 --> 43:16.795
we'll know when they're
hitting the diamond.

43:16.895 --> 43:18.596
I know her travel agent.

43:18.697 --> 43:19.530
She's coming here.

43:19.631 --> 43:20.832
He may tell me.

43:20.932 --> 43:21.833
Do it.

43:21.933 --> 43:22.933
Call him.

43:37.582 --> 43:41.920
Could I have a
cappuccino to go, please?

43:54.399 --> 43:56.067
He said she's coming in a month.

43:59.771 --> 44:01.211
He said that she's
coming in a month.

44:03.875 --> 44:05.176
We can't wait a month.

44:05.276 --> 44:07.178
What do you suggest?

44:07.278 --> 44:10.949
We need to twist the
pig's ear, watch it squeal.

44:11.049 --> 44:12.784
Yes, clearly.

44:12.884 --> 44:15.620
I don't understand
that metaphor.

44:15.721 --> 44:17.823
We need to put the
squeeze on Arkady,

44:17.923 --> 44:19.991
so the cops jump all over him.

44:20.091 --> 44:22.327
And he's forced into
stealing the diamond sooner

44:22.427 --> 44:23.795
rather than later.

44:23.895 --> 44:25.406
It's got to be
something big, but you'd

44:25.430 --> 44:28.834
have to scare the crap out of
him, panic him into action.

44:33.905 --> 44:37.575
Arkady just claimed
insurance on this building.

44:37.675 --> 44:39.610
He upped his
insurance policy just

44:39.711 --> 44:41.146
before Deacon set fire to it.

44:41.246 --> 44:44.149
He used the insurance money so
he could fix it up and sell it,

44:44.249 --> 44:46.785
but the police are still
investigating the incident.

44:46.885 --> 44:48.854
That's good.

44:48.954 --> 44:49.687
That's good.

44:49.788 --> 44:51.656
You thinking what I'm thinking?

44:51.757 --> 44:53.158
Possibly.

44:53.258 --> 44:55.827
Yeah?

44:55.927 --> 44:57.562
We blow the
hell out of the building,

44:57.662 --> 45:00.431
so the police jump all over
Arkady, which should make

45:00.531 --> 45:03.935
him steal the diamond faster.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.303
Got full crew in the car.

45:05.403 --> 45:06.471
Roger, Pauly.

45:06.571 --> 45:07.472
Go get him, Corny.

45:07.572 --> 45:08.306
Over and out.

45:08.406 --> 45:09.406
Yep.

45:09.975 --> 45:14.645
All right, you son of a bitch.

45:14.746 --> 45:15.346
Bullseye.

45:15.446 --> 45:16.446
Oh!

45:18.516 --> 45:19.516
Bullseye.

45:24.890 --> 45:25.290
My shift.

45:25.390 --> 45:26.624
Yeah.

45:26.724 --> 45:28.335
Hey, Tommy, do you mind if I
borrow your gun real quick?

45:28.359 --> 45:28.760
What?

45:28.860 --> 45:29.694
Why?

45:29.795 --> 45:30.495
I'm going to the pub next door.

45:30.595 --> 45:31.696
I'm gonna snoop around.

45:31.797 --> 45:34.032
Feel safer having it on
me, you know what I mean?

45:34.132 --> 45:35.666
Have you told Eddie
about your visits?

45:35.767 --> 45:37.903
What's... who cares...
It's not even a big...

45:38.003 --> 45:40.043
He won't even care... we're...
You know what I mean?

45:40.138 --> 45:41.172
So.

45:41.272 --> 45:43.541
It's a special edition
Glock 26 polymer-framed

45:43.641 --> 45:45.911
semiautomatic pistol.

45:46.011 --> 45:46.845
Try not to kill a child.

45:46.945 --> 45:47.712
Yeah, no, no.

45:47.813 --> 45:48.546
I wouldn't kill a child.

45:48.646 --> 45:49.924
I am just honestly going next...

45:49.948 --> 45:50.992
I'm going to probably
find something out,

45:51.016 --> 45:52.126
so it's good to have
this just in case I

45:52.150 --> 45:53.051
need a.

45:53.151 --> 45:53.684
Mhm.

45:53.785 --> 45:54.319
Mhm.

45:54.419 --> 45:54.886
Mhm.

45:54.986 --> 45:55.821
So fuck you.

45:55.921 --> 45:56.921
Have fun.

45:59.057 --> 46:00.425
Let me get a
whiskey and whatever

46:00.525 --> 46:01.993
the pretty lady would like.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.795
Hello, Ted.

46:03.895 --> 46:05.463
Oh, you remember my name.

46:05.563 --> 46:06.364
Yeah.

46:06.464 --> 46:07.265
Oh.

46:07.365 --> 46:08.766
How's the girlfriend, the?

46:08.867 --> 46:10.668
Oh, no, I don't
have a girlfriend.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.637
She left me when I
was on the asteroid.

46:12.737 --> 46:13.604
- Aw.
- I know.

46:13.704 --> 46:14.572
And I loved her.

46:14.672 --> 46:15.273
I mean, I loved her.

46:15.373 --> 46:16.107
I gave her everything.

46:16.207 --> 46:17.075
I gave her cars.

46:17.175 --> 46:18.443
I gave her love.

46:18.543 --> 46:20.521
But when you're on that asteroid
and you're saving the world,

46:20.545 --> 46:22.247
it becomes...

46:22.347 --> 46:24.615
Like you become like a hero.

46:24.715 --> 46:26.051
And sometimes, I can't handle.

46:26.151 --> 46:28.453
Here you go, darling.

46:28.553 --> 46:33.591
Well, make the bitch
die confused and alone.

46:33.691 --> 46:34.691
Fuck yeah.

46:36.294 --> 46:39.597
Hey, um, why don't you and
I get a little dinner, maybe

46:39.697 --> 46:41.199
a drink, and talk about this?

46:43.301 --> 46:45.470
I've made other arrangements.

46:45.570 --> 46:46.737
Excuse me?

46:46.838 --> 46:48.907
Where are you going?

46:49.007 --> 46:50.408
I have to go.

46:50.508 --> 46:51.685
Uh, you don't have time for...

46:51.709 --> 46:52.709
See you later!

46:56.581 --> 46:59.617
If you come with me right now,
you may find yourself having

46:59.717 --> 47:01.719
an experience so
fucking intense,

47:01.819 --> 47:03.688
it'll make you feel
lit up from the inside

47:03.788 --> 47:07.292
like you've never
fucking felt before.

47:10.795 --> 47:13.564
It's so great to see you.

47:20.605 --> 47:25.944
Mhm.

47:30.715 --> 47:33.184
Oh, actually, actually, you
know, where's your bathroom?

47:33.284 --> 47:34.185
Uh, in the pub.

47:34.285 --> 47:35.120
Good.

47:35.220 --> 47:36.121
I'm gonna... I'm
gonna use it, OK?

47:36.221 --> 47:36.654
And then, you're
going to go upstairs?

47:36.754 --> 47:37.355
Yeah.

47:37.455 --> 47:38.189
OK, I'm gonna fuck you?

47:38.289 --> 47:38.856
Mhm.

47:38.957 --> 47:39.958
I'm gonna have it...

47:40.058 --> 47:41.068
I'm going... I'm going
to do this and this?

47:41.092 --> 47:44.262
Promises, promises, eh?

47:44.362 --> 47:45.596
Don't be long.

47:45.696 --> 47:48.666
Anyway, so.

47:48.766 --> 47:50.135
I'm just running to the toilet.

47:50.235 --> 47:51.569
I'll be back.

47:55.506 --> 47:58.276
Fuck off, having a shit.

47:58.376 --> 47:58.977
Yeah.

47:59.077 --> 47:59.744
Yeah.

47:59.844 --> 48:01.179
Yup, yup, yup.

48:01.279 --> 48:02.279
Fuck.

48:08.186 --> 48:14.960
Got it.

48:15.060 --> 48:23.060
What are you doing here?

48:30.976 --> 48:32.910
How weird.

48:33.011 --> 48:35.146
Came here for the
fish and chips.

48:35.246 --> 48:38.483
This is a good restaurant.

48:38.583 --> 48:39.583
You OK?

48:42.787 --> 48:45.656
And now on, , it's Robert.

48:45.756 --> 48:47.858
Danova with "Notte D'amore"

48:47.959 --> 48:50.828
[MUSIC - ROBERTO DANOVA, "NOTTE
D'AMORE"]

49:10.181 --> 49:12.050
Disgusting little man.

49:21.592 --> 49:23.161
Who is that guy?

49:23.261 --> 49:24.895
He the guy who
took all your cash?

49:27.498 --> 49:28.566
Tommy told you?

49:28.666 --> 49:31.069
Why do women always go
for these douche bags?

49:39.210 --> 49:40.511
Why are you talking to this guy?

49:40.611 --> 49:41.912
You can call me naive,

49:42.013 --> 49:45.250
but I thought he wanted
to get back with me.

49:45.350 --> 49:48.219
He wanted money.

49:48.319 --> 49:49.439
You want me to kick his ass?

49:54.825 --> 49:56.094
I was joking.

49:56.194 --> 49:58.963
Forget about him,
me kicking his ass.

49:59.064 --> 50:01.099
Positive... you've got
to stay positive, honey.

50:03.501 --> 50:04.902
Glass half...

50:05.002 --> 50:07.038
Glass half full.

50:07.138 --> 50:08.839
You know, I saved your life.

50:08.939 --> 50:11.476
And you said if there was a
favor you could do for me...

50:17.182 --> 50:19.550
Katherine, look, let me explain.

50:19.650 --> 50:20.827
It's... it's... it's embarrassing.

50:20.851 --> 50:22.553
I'm taking these.

50:22.653 --> 50:24.122
Katherine?

50:24.222 --> 50:26.057
Katherine.

50:26.157 --> 50:27.625
Where are you going?

50:27.725 --> 50:28.459
Let's not do this.

50:28.559 --> 50:29.360
Come on, have a chip.

50:29.460 --> 50:29.860
Sit down.

50:29.960 --> 50:30.428
Relax.

50:30.528 --> 50:31.362
Out of my way.

50:31.462 --> 50:32.539
Hey, stop being a douche bag.

50:32.563 --> 50:34.332
Come on.

50:38.969 --> 50:43.274
Get your hands
off me, you American prick.

50:43.374 --> 50:45.210
Fucking hell.

51:04.729 --> 51:08.733
You want some more money?

51:47.872 --> 51:49.740
Can I make you some coffee?

51:56.247 --> 51:57.348
Where you been?

51:57.448 --> 51:58.516
Nowhere.

51:58.616 --> 51:59.083
Stop.

51:59.184 --> 51:59.917
What the fuck?

52:00.017 --> 52:02.052
Is that my fucking toilet paper?

52:02.153 --> 52:03.020
Uh, no.

52:03.120 --> 52:03.854
Yes, it is.

52:03.954 --> 52:05.132
That's my fucking toilet paper.

52:05.156 --> 52:06.324
Where's my gun?

52:06.424 --> 52:09.160
I don't have it on me right now.

52:09.260 --> 52:10.561
What gun? What happened?

52:10.661 --> 52:12.806
Paul went to Deacon's pub and
fucked what I can only assume

52:12.830 --> 52:14.499
was the ghost of Christmas past.

52:14.599 --> 52:15.766
Son of a bitch.

52:15.866 --> 52:17.067
Where's my gun?

52:17.168 --> 52:20.137
OK, it might be in
the toilet of Deacon's pub.

52:20.238 --> 52:24.475
First things first,
where are my wet wipes?

52:32.450 --> 52:34.719
They wanted me for Frodo.

52:34.819 --> 52:35.820
No shit, Frodo Baggins?

52:35.920 --> 52:37.922
This is 1999.

52:38.022 --> 52:40.157
I was, uh, much thinner then.

52:40.258 --> 52:41.298
The director, he loved me.

52:41.326 --> 52:43.428
Took me for lunch,
said I was too tall.

52:43.528 --> 52:44.729
Ugh.

52:44.829 --> 52:48.733
To make me hobbit size was
going to add a $1 million

52:48.833 --> 52:50.134
per foot.

52:50.235 --> 52:53.504
Yeah, $1 million a foot
for every effects shot.

52:53.604 --> 52:54.372
A million dollars?

52:54.472 --> 52:55.039
I'm six-foot-two.

52:55.139 --> 52:56.541
Yeah, you're huge.

52:56.641 --> 52:59.344
So they went with
the shorter fellow.

52:59.444 --> 52:59.944
Elijah Wood.

53:00.044 --> 53:00.745
Mm.

53:00.845 --> 53:01.479
Fuck that.

53:01.579 --> 53:02.613
You know what?

53:02.713 --> 53:03.248
I'm going to put you in
my independent movie.

53:03.348 --> 53:03.981
Really?

53:04.081 --> 53:05.081
Yes.

53:05.149 --> 53:06.517
Think about it for a second, OK?

53:06.617 --> 53:08.052
It starts with a
45-minute one-shot.

53:08.152 --> 53:09.454
Do you like lens flare?

53:09.554 --> 53:10.855
Fuck, I love lens flare.

53:10.955 --> 53:12.032
There's so much lens flare in
this, you're going to be like,

53:12.056 --> 53:12.523
what?

53:12.623 --> 53:13.491
What's going on?

53:13.591 --> 53:14.768
There's so much
fucking lens flare.

53:14.792 --> 53:15.926
- Close your eyes.
- Yeah.

53:16.026 --> 53:17.795
I'm gonna give you
the working title...

53:17.895 --> 53:20.231
"No More Nothing."

53:20.331 --> 53:21.432
Ooh, yeah.

53:21.532 --> 53:22.900
Whew.

53:23.000 --> 53:23.534
Yeah.

53:23.634 --> 53:24.369
"No More Nothing."

53:24.469 --> 53:25.035
Think about it.

53:25.135 --> 53:25.536
I like it.

53:25.636 --> 53:26.371
Yeah?

53:26.471 --> 53:28.072
I like it, Pauly.

53:28.172 --> 53:28.706
It's dark.

53:28.806 --> 53:31.609
It sort of hangs.

53:31.709 --> 53:32.709
Hangs there, doesn't it?

53:32.777 --> 53:33.378
Yeah.

53:33.478 --> 53:33.978
But then, it just drops.

53:34.078 --> 53:35.813
Into nothing or...

53:35.913 --> 53:36.747
Everything.

53:36.847 --> 53:37.648
Hey, come on, guys. Let's move.

53:37.748 --> 53:38.616
We've got other floors to do.

53:38.716 --> 53:39.716
Let's go.

53:49.226 --> 53:50.461
Ordinates working well?

53:50.561 --> 53:51.329
Yeah, perfect, sir.

53:51.429 --> 53:52.229
Thank you for your help.

53:52.330 --> 53:53.374
You're a good man, Uncle Martin.

53:53.398 --> 53:54.599
Where do want this?

53:54.699 --> 53:55.700
Right there, Corny.

53:55.800 --> 53:56.901
Yeah, pack it to the brim.

53:57.001 --> 53:58.001
When in doubt...

53:58.035 --> 53:59.604
Overload?

53:59.704 --> 54:04.909
I spot a fellow military
man from a mile away.

54:05.009 --> 54:08.879
Ever so thrilled to be
working with you all again.

54:08.979 --> 54:11.516
All this sitting
around on cool surfaces

54:11.616 --> 54:13.684
is terrible for the prostate.

54:13.784 --> 54:15.185
Prostate?

54:15.286 --> 54:17.355
We all know roughly
where it is, but where

54:17.455 --> 54:19.156
exactly is the prostate?

54:19.256 --> 54:22.226
Well, you know when you
shove your finger up your ass?

54:25.930 --> 54:27.932
No.

54:28.032 --> 54:31.135
Do people do... what do you mean?

54:35.606 --> 54:37.542
Get that thing out
of my fucking face.

54:37.642 --> 54:39.276
You've got to just
wrap those things up.

54:39.377 --> 54:40.621
- Yeah, look at it.
- It's disgusting.

54:40.645 --> 54:42.022
This is going to
save your life one day.

54:42.046 --> 54:43.390
Imagine if you have
a hole right here.

54:43.414 --> 54:44.048
Ugh. Get that thing away...

54:44.148 --> 54:45.049
Hey, guys, come on.

54:45.149 --> 54:45.783
Everybody's be fucking let go.

54:45.883 --> 54:46.451
I wish I...

54:46.551 --> 54:47.418
You still got that?

54:47.518 --> 54:48.529
How long you had
this fucking thing?

54:48.553 --> 54:49.630
For a while,
but if you get hurt,

54:49.654 --> 54:50.664
you're going to want me to use.

54:50.688 --> 54:51.989
You need to keep it sterile.

55:19.550 --> 55:20.550
I say.

55:25.022 --> 55:27.725
Someone's been shopping.

55:27.825 --> 55:30.595
Do you
want us to... are we blowing...

55:30.695 --> 55:31.738
We're blowing someone up, right?

55:31.762 --> 55:32.597
Uh.

55:32.697 --> 55:34.064
Should we...

55:34.164 --> 55:35.433
Yeah.

55:35.533 --> 55:42.440
Let's, um... yeah, so, uh, don't
touch it till you're ready.

55:55.953 --> 55:56.953
Ah!

56:15.606 --> 56:16.707
Police have called.

56:16.807 --> 56:19.176
They're preparing
investigation into the matter,

56:19.276 --> 56:22.747
especially because you claimed
insurance on the previous fire.

56:22.847 --> 56:24.782
They found traces of explosives.

56:24.882 --> 56:27.918
I'll do my best, but we are
sailing close to the wind

56:28.018 --> 56:29.920
on this one, Arkady.

56:30.020 --> 56:32.222
Couple of my sources
tell me that the police

56:32.322 --> 56:36.894
will arrest you in the next
few days, maybe even today.

56:40.431 --> 56:41.711
Seems you have a
personal grudge.

56:41.799 --> 56:43.968
Any idea who could have done it?

56:44.068 --> 56:49.774
You know, in my country,
you could talk to anyone...

56:49.874 --> 56:52.342
Judges, police, lawyers.

56:52.443 --> 56:53.844
Just give them a
little something,

56:53.944 --> 56:55.480
and they make things disappear.

56:55.580 --> 56:58.949
Ah, I miss it, my people.

57:02.052 --> 57:05.022
They understood these
ways, because they're

57:05.122 --> 57:08.225
human, not like these
dishonest bumfuckers.

57:10.360 --> 57:12.162
Oh, yes.

57:12.262 --> 57:13.262
Oh, yes.

57:15.900 --> 57:19.036
Look, see if you can buy
some time with the police.

57:19.136 --> 57:20.838
Say... what?

57:20.938 --> 57:21.839
Say anything.

57:21.939 --> 57:24.041
Yeah?

57:24.141 --> 57:27.845
Yeah, look, find...
Find your own way out.

57:27.945 --> 57:31.448
I've got to go, so...

57:36.521 --> 57:38.923
Yeah?

57:39.023 --> 57:40.090
OK, I see him.

57:40.190 --> 57:41.190
I got him.

58:29.840 --> 58:34.912
Up, two, three, four, and up.

58:35.012 --> 58:36.881
Up.

58:36.981 --> 58:37.848
Hold it here.

58:37.948 --> 58:39.817
Four, three, two, one.

58:39.917 --> 58:41.285
Let's go.

58:41.385 --> 58:43.253
And up, two, three, four.

58:43.353 --> 58:44.254
And squeeze.

58:44.354 --> 58:45.723
Gotta be kidding me.

58:45.823 --> 58:47.357
Up, two, three, four,

58:47.457 --> 58:50.227
and squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

58:50.327 --> 58:55.032
Up, two, three,
four, and freeze.

58:55.132 --> 58:56.166
Ridiculous.

58:56.266 --> 58:57.266
What is he doing?

59:00.404 --> 59:01.839
Is this like a British thing?

59:01.939 --> 59:05.710
Put the squeeze on this guy, he
goes to a fucking salsa class.

59:05.810 --> 59:07.344
I don't think this is salsa.

59:07.444 --> 59:09.614
This is some sort
of fusion, sort

59:09.714 --> 59:12.349
of Nazi-themed with
urban street dance.

59:12.449 --> 59:13.150
Tommy.

59:13.250 --> 59:13.851
Ridiculous.

59:13.951 --> 59:14.685
What else we gotta do?

59:14.785 --> 59:17.121
We blew up a fucking building.

59:17.221 --> 59:18.589
He spends hours there.

59:18.689 --> 59:20.858
He's drinking smoothies,
eating granola.

59:20.958 --> 59:21.759
This is nothing.

59:21.859 --> 59:23.003
Corny, did you get
anything today?

59:23.027 --> 59:24.895
Little fella.

59:24.995 --> 59:26.797
Tommy?

59:26.897 --> 59:27.965
Nothing, yeah.

59:28.065 --> 59:29.066
Great.

59:29.166 --> 59:30.577
What have you got with
Deacon and the boys?

59:30.601 --> 59:31.435
Followed them into town.

59:31.535 --> 59:32.535
Saw them for hours.

59:32.603 --> 59:34.071
Lost them for like 30 minutes.

59:34.171 --> 59:36.282
Saw them again right here at the
pub, and that's where they are.

59:36.306 --> 59:38.976
I had fucking nothing for today.

59:39.076 --> 59:39.677
Great.

59:39.777 --> 59:40.577
We have fucking nothing.

59:40.678 --> 59:41.345
What are we doing?

59:41.445 --> 59:44.214
Eddie, what do we do?

59:44.314 --> 59:45.716
Eddie!

59:45.816 --> 59:48.853
Eddie, stop.

59:48.953 --> 59:50.020
What are we fucking doing?

59:55.092 --> 59:56.460
I'm sorry, princess,
we got to go.

59:56.560 --> 59:57.294
You're sorry?

59:57.394 --> 59:58.228
Don't fucking call me princess.

59:58.328 --> 59:59.328
What are you saying?

59:59.396 --> 01:00:00.741
You're just going to
go back to America?

01:00:00.765 --> 01:00:04.001
If we stay here any longer,
we're in trouble, big trouble.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:05.803
It's that easy for you?

01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:10.274
Well, before you go, let me just
tell you that that bag that's

01:00:10.374 --> 01:00:12.943
in this video is our
bag, the same bag you

01:00:13.043 --> 01:00:14.244
stole which had the bonds in.

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.846
And the man taking
the bag here is

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.548
head of security at the Blue
Iguana safety deposit center,

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:20.550
where the Blue Iguana's stored.

01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:22.386
Arkady's clearly
exchanged the bonds you

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:23.854
stole for the security codes.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:26.032
They're going to just walk
straight in... no safe cracking,

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:27.858
no explosives... just
take the Blue Iguana

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.727
and walk straight out.

01:00:29.827 --> 01:00:35.365
Your plan to put the squeeze
on Arkady actually worked.

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:37.634
But if you're just so
desperate to leave,

01:00:37.735 --> 01:00:39.436
don't let me stop you.

01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:45.408
I need some ice cream.

01:00:53.818 --> 01:00:57.187
You all right?

01:00:57.287 --> 01:00:58.488
Just tired.

01:00:58.588 --> 01:00:59.588
Want a little?

01:01:02.126 --> 01:01:05.996
Have a little...
Little ice cream?

01:01:16.573 --> 01:01:17.808
Yes?

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:20.577
Oh, hello.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.847
Yeah.

01:01:22.947 --> 01:01:23.848
OK.

01:01:23.948 --> 01:01:25.549
Thank you.

01:01:25.649 --> 01:01:28.518
That was the princess's
travel agent.

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:31.588
He says she's landing
in a few hours,

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:33.323
staying at a hotel
for six hours,

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:34.759
and then flying straight out.

01:01:34.859 --> 01:01:36.827
Tell me what happened
with Deacon again.

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:38.228
Yep.

01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:40.206
Followed him and the apes all
day, lost them in town for bit,

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:41.908
picked them back up, followed
them to Deacon's pub,

01:01:41.932 --> 01:01:43.109
and that's where
they are right now.

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:44.733
They closed the place
down for the night.

01:01:46.236 --> 01:01:47.604
It's Uncle Martin.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:50.707
Arkady just got on a
train back into town.

01:01:50.808 --> 01:01:53.543
They stole it today.

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:55.179
They have the diamond.

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:56.413
They got the diamond.

01:01:56.513 --> 01:01:57.114
They got the diamond.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:58.115
What's happening?

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:59.683
They stole it when you lost

01:01:59.784 --> 01:02:02.252
them in town for 30 minutes.

01:02:02.352 --> 01:02:03.463
Arkady must have
left town, so he

01:02:03.487 --> 01:02:04.697
wouldn't be around
when it was stolen

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.223
in case something happened.

01:02:06.323 --> 01:02:08.458
He's coming back now,
knowing it's been successful.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:11.128
They'll deliver it to Arkady,
who'll give it to the princess

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:12.228
today.

01:02:12.296 --> 01:02:14.498
Gang's protecting
Deacon until delivery.

01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:16.767
We need to hit
the pub right now.

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:17.267
Wait.

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:18.668
Wait Wait.

01:02:18.769 --> 01:02:19.913
I don't know if we have to go...
We don't have to go right now.

01:02:19.937 --> 01:02:21.247
We can't go in
there guns blazing.

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:22.272
That's fucking suicide.

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:23.040
What about this?

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:23.740
Let's think for a second.

01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:24.574
We're not even thinking.

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:25.752
We're not throwing ideas around.

01:02:25.776 --> 01:02:27.444
If we think like
an intricate plan

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:29.679
that involves no violence
and no guns at all and then

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:31.715
we sneak in when
they're totally unaware

01:02:31.816 --> 01:02:33.393
and do it without shooting
or fucking killing...

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:34.151
Because we could do that.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:35.152
We're sneaky.

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:38.422
Let's think it
through for a second.

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:40.224
Why don't you sit
this one out, pal?

01:02:40.324 --> 01:02:41.534
Maybe I watch from the monitor,

01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:42.735
make sure everything's
going wrong...

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.829
If something goes wrong, I...
Yeah.

01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:47.798
I'll yell...

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:48.732
Someone needs to.

01:02:48.833 --> 01:02:49.876
Someone needs to
watch the monitor.

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:50.900
You know what I mean?

01:02:57.541 --> 01:03:00.644
Outside in 10?

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:07.584
Hey.

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:09.854
Listen, I told
the guys if we get

01:03:09.954 --> 01:03:14.758
the rock and something happens
to one of us, just keep going.

01:03:14.859 --> 01:03:15.725
This yous?

01:03:15.826 --> 01:03:17.294
Um.

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:18.896
- Let me see it.
- Maybe.

01:03:18.996 --> 01:03:20.197
Ehhh.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:21.297
OK.

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:27.471
It's just a dumb comic book.

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:28.873
Final battle.

01:03:28.973 --> 01:03:30.875
His castle lies ahead.

01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:33.343
He holds her captive there.

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:34.311
I have no fear.

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:37.447
Her love is my
shield against evil,

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:39.716
for I know she would
sacrifice her life for me

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.886
also, for her love is true.

01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:26.630
Does it match my blue eyes?

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.403
Get the car.

01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:36.040
I'm going for a piss.

01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:43.914
[MUSIC - TOM JONES, "DID TROUBLE
ME"]

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.069
Ugh.

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:56.940
You'll be fine.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.040
I need to ditch that car.

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:04.881
Your timing is perfect.

01:08:04.981 --> 01:08:06.261
Had some trouble with the police

01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:07.584
on the way to you.

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:09.219
What kind of trouble?

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:10.187
We don't know yet.

01:08:10.287 --> 01:08:11.788
Can't move.

01:08:11.888 --> 01:08:13.590
Where are you?

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.359
Between places.

01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:16.693
I'll call you in an hour.

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:17.792
No, don't.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:32.876
Where did you go,
David fucking Blaine?

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:34.278
I went to get the car, boss.

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:35.044
Car?

01:08:35.145 --> 01:08:36.645
Where's the car, France?

01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:38.358
It was around the
corner, but then, you've

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:39.492
got to get it nice and warm.

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:40.783
Get it warm?

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:42.786
It's fucking summer.

01:08:42.886 --> 01:08:44.764
The air conditioning in
that car... it should be

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:45.654
warm for the air conditioning.

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:46.990
It's like fucking Vietnam,

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:50.093
fucking Syria, fucking ISIS
all rolled into fucking one

01:08:50.194 --> 01:08:50.926
in here.

01:08:51.027 --> 01:08:52.028
ISIS... ISIS?

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:53.662
ISIS, it's a
terrorist organization

01:08:53.763 --> 01:08:58.033
formed out of Al-Qai... watch...
Watch the fucking news!

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.103
It does get very hot
in the car, there, boss.

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:04.207
Shut your mouth,
you fucking twat.

01:09:04.308 --> 01:09:05.675
Move that useless
lump downstairs

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:09.645
with the other useless prats.

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:18.322
What are you
laughing at, yankee?

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:21.157
I love that accent.

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:23.627
It's crazy exotic.

01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:25.638
You're the one that's tied
to a fucking pool table,

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.697
so I'd keep your fucking
mouth fucking shut.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:29.517
Are we gonna be here
for a while, you think?

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:31.033
How much she paying you, that

01:09:31.134 --> 01:09:32.868
ugly fucking four-eyed cow?

01:09:32.969 --> 01:09:33.979
Hey, don't worry about her.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:34.871
Yeah?

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:35.805
Everything is going
to be just fine.

01:09:35.904 --> 01:09:36.944
I don't fucking trust her.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.975
She could be playing
you like a violin, man.

01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:40.310
Eh, maybe.

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:41.310
I don't know.

01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:43.846
I just hope I'm
fucking wrong about her.

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:45.180
Wrong about her?

01:09:45.282 --> 01:09:47.551
Hope she cares more
about you than the diamond,

01:09:47.651 --> 01:09:50.854
because you're my fucking
only way out of here, yankee.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.788
Do you get me?

01:09:59.763 --> 01:10:00.763
It's him.

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:07.070
I've got what you want.

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:08.372
You've got what I want.

01:10:08.472 --> 01:10:09.973
What are you gonna do?

01:10:10.073 --> 01:10:11.808
All right, I'll give
you what you want,

01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:13.977
but only in a public place.

01:10:14.077 --> 01:10:16.446
I'm gonna send someone
over to stay with you,

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:17.681
see if our man's OK.

01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:19.692
Once you've released him
to my friend and he's safe,

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:21.885
I'll hand it over.

01:10:21.985 --> 01:10:23.687
Where?

01:10:23.787 --> 01:10:25.522
Morris, Lover Lane, 45 minutes.

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:32.195
You're gonna have
to go in there.

01:10:32.296 --> 01:10:33.330
No fucking way.

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:34.163
No, they're
not going to do anything

01:10:34.264 --> 01:10:35.408
to you, as long as I have this.

01:10:35.432 --> 01:10:37.200
Anyway, they do
know you're coming.

01:10:37.301 --> 01:10:38.968
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:42.706
What the fuck is
happening right now?

01:10:42.806 --> 01:10:45.842
You left the gun in the toilet.

01:10:45.942 --> 01:10:46.943
Oh my god.

01:10:47.043 --> 01:10:48.745
The gun, you left in the toilet.

01:10:48.845 --> 01:10:49.646
Is it still there? I don't know.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:50.213
Maybe.

01:10:50.314 --> 01:10:52.148
I have no idea.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.983
Here's what's going to happen.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:57.621
You go in there, see if he's OK.

01:10:57.721 --> 01:10:59.423
You ask permission
to use the toilet.

01:10:59.523 --> 01:11:00.624
You get the gun.

01:11:00.724 --> 01:11:05.061
I'll phone you when I'm with
Deacon, say "good luck."

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:06.439
Get the gun out, start shooting.

01:11:06.463 --> 01:11:08.131
Just fucking kill them all.

01:11:08.231 --> 01:11:10.133
Oh, but oh, this
isn't "The Godfather,"

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:15.104
and I'm not Al
fucking Pacino, OK?

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:16.105
Listen.

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:19.943
Listen, Katherine,
I'm not a killer.

01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:21.611
I know I bigged
myself up to you,

01:11:21.711 --> 01:11:25.382
but I'm just a fucking
smartass with a big mouth.

01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:27.050
I'd gathered.

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:30.954
Thing is, Paul, that you
sat the last one out.

01:11:31.054 --> 01:11:34.758
If you'd been with us, Tommy
might not have been injured.

01:11:34.858 --> 01:11:37.727
And Eddie definitely
wouldn't have been taken.

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:39.729
I can't do it.

01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:40.897
Got no choice, princess.

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:24.574
Think you're smart
picking this place

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:25.909
near a police station?

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:42.759
You have any idea what I'm gonna
do to that ugly face of yours

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:44.160
when this is over?

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:48.808
Put up your hands
up against the wall.

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:49.298
Where?

01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:50.534
Over there.

01:12:50.634 --> 01:12:51.468
You all right?

01:12:51.568 --> 01:12:54.704
Hey, man, never been better.

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:55.639
Feel great.

01:12:55.739 --> 01:12:56.739
Yeah?

01:12:56.773 --> 01:12:57.407
You sit down.

01:12:57.507 --> 01:12:58.842
You shut your mouth.

01:12:58.942 --> 01:13:00.477
Great to see you, pal.

01:13:00.577 --> 01:13:02.045
Over there.

01:13:02.145 --> 01:13:04.247
What the heck you doing here?

01:13:04.347 --> 01:13:05.715
Oh, I was just passing by.

01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:08.184
Shut up.

01:13:08.284 --> 01:13:10.654
I want him out of there,
and then I'll give it you.

01:13:10.754 --> 01:13:12.121
Well, let's see it.

01:13:22.365 --> 01:13:24.333
I could do with a smoke.

01:13:24.434 --> 01:13:26.169
Disappearing again?

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:27.837
Get some cigarettes.

01:13:27.937 --> 01:13:29.973
You're making a
habit out of this.

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:31.073
I'll be back.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.642
Just get back
quicker this time, yeah?

01:13:40.817 --> 01:13:43.019
Can I go to the
bathroom, please?

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:44.754
Are you scared, mate?

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:46.322
He's got a bad tummy.

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:48.625
Ooh, upset tummy, yeah?

01:13:48.725 --> 01:13:49.392
Yes.

01:13:49.493 --> 01:13:50.193
Go ahead and fuck off.

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:51.293
It's over there.

01:13:57.534 --> 01:13:58.534
What are you doing?

01:13:58.602 --> 01:13:59.645
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:00.470
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:01.971
What the fuck are you doing?

01:14:20.023 --> 01:14:21.023
Hurry up.

01:14:21.057 --> 01:14:22.057
Come on.

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:36.272
Yeah?

01:14:36.372 --> 01:14:37.473
Put their guy on.

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:42.378
Hello?

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:44.981
Is he OK?

01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:46.115
Yeah.

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:47.784
Yeah, he's OK.

01:14:47.884 --> 01:14:51.120
OK, well call me
you're both safe.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.220
Good luck.

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:56.225
Can I get you anything, sir?

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:57.861
Fuck off.

01:14:57.961 --> 01:15:05.234
This one's on you,
ugly son of a bitch.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:08.004
Goodbye, Katherine.

01:15:08.104 --> 01:15:10.006
Thank you for the call.

01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:11.240
You are now debt-free.

01:15:19.549 --> 01:15:21.484
Now, now, you
don't want to cause

01:15:21.585 --> 01:15:24.453
a scene with the local
constabulary here, eh?

01:15:24.554 --> 01:15:25.722
She's got the diamond.

01:15:25.822 --> 01:15:28.592
Of course.

01:15:28.692 --> 01:15:29.292
She's got it.

01:15:29.392 --> 01:15:30.159
Ugh.

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:32.729
She's got it.

01:15:32.829 --> 01:15:33.930
She's got it.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.933
You steal it and
then call Katherine

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:38.935
to bribe her to take
you to the princess

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.804
to take everything yourself.

01:15:40.904 --> 01:15:43.840
Arkady, she stole it.

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:45.585
Like you tried to steal
the bonds by sending

01:15:45.609 --> 01:15:46.710
those two men of yours.

01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:48.810
You know, they turned up
with holes in their heads.

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:02.892
Hey.

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:04.527
What's that smell?

01:16:04.628 --> 01:16:07.263
You smell that?

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:12.268
George, George, George, George,
George, George, of the Jungle.

01:16:12.368 --> 01:16:16.239
What the fuck is that smell?

01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:17.339
Do you smell that?

01:16:17.373 --> 01:16:18.842
Was that in your pants?

01:16:18.942 --> 01:16:20.476
You got some poopy
in your pants,

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:21.745
little boy Georgie-borgie?

01:16:21.845 --> 01:16:23.613
Georgie got a
poopy in his pants?

01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:25.749
That smells like a
skunk with fucking

01:16:25.849 --> 01:16:29.052
herpes crawled up your fucking
red baboon ass and fucking

01:16:29.152 --> 01:16:29.753
died.

01:16:29.853 --> 01:16:31.520
Jesus Christ, you stink.

01:16:31.621 --> 01:16:33.356
Fucking take a
bath, motherfucker.

01:16:33.456 --> 01:16:35.091
Shut the fuck up.

01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:35.591
Ah.

01:16:35.692 --> 01:16:36.692
Fuck!

01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:51.040
Ah.

01:16:53.643 --> 01:16:55.544
Motherfuck.

01:16:59.649 --> 01:17:00.116
It's OK.

01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:00.884
It's just blood.

01:17:00.984 --> 01:17:02.185
Let's... come on, let's go.

01:17:05.889 --> 01:17:06.522
It's OK.

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:07.857
Come here.

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:09.158
Untie me.

01:17:14.597 --> 01:17:15.398
Ow!

01:17:15.498 --> 01:17:16.399
Ow! Fuck!

01:17:16.499 --> 01:17:17.633
What are you fucking doing?

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:19.035
- Stopping the bleeding.
- Ow!

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:19.903
Get the fuck away from me.

01:17:20.003 --> 01:17:22.005
Fucking untie me.

01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:24.140
Jesus Christ.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:27.510
The fuck is the matter with you?

01:17:35.018 --> 01:17:36.419
Oh, fuck.

01:17:40.957 --> 01:17:42.358
Hey, it's OK.

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:43.827
Just go... go wash it off.

01:17:43.927 --> 01:17:48.531
Hey, where's... is she OK?

01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:49.298
Where's Katherine?

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:50.398
Where's Katherine?

01:17:55.038 --> 01:17:57.774
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:17:57.874 --> 01:17:58.708
- Hi.
- What's up?

01:17:58.808 --> 01:18:00.543
Yeah, not much.

01:18:02.045 --> 01:18:04.814
What took you so long?

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:06.049
Sorry.

01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:07.583
Uh, you need to see this.

01:18:12.889 --> 01:18:14.009
OK, we don't have much time.

01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:17.927
Guys, did I get everything off?

01:18:22.498 --> 01:18:24.167
Well, did George
accidentally shoot

01:18:24.267 --> 01:18:28.104
himself in the head because of
the guilt of smelling so bad?

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:30.004
I had a yankee tied to
the fucking pool table.

01:18:30.073 --> 01:18:31.707
Oh yeah?

01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:35.945
Did... did... did he want
a share of the diamond,

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:37.222
and you wouldn't give it to him?

01:18:37.246 --> 01:18:38.815
What are you talking about?

01:18:38.915 --> 01:18:40.316
All my men are fucking dead.

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:41.450
Well, I can see that.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:42.728
I've been shot
in the shoulder, Arkady.

01:18:42.752 --> 01:18:44.320
It's a nice shirt, that one.

01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:47.256
Look, make sure all the doors
are locked and come back, hm?

01:18:56.032 --> 01:18:56.732
You know what?

01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:58.835
I know it's here somewhere.

01:18:58.935 --> 01:18:59.935
She's got the diamond.

01:19:00.003 --> 01:19:01.243
I'm not going to look for it...

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:07.210
because you are going
to tell me where it is.

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:08.945
Yeah?

01:19:09.045 --> 01:19:12.615
She's got the diamond,
I swear on my life.

01:19:13.616 --> 01:19:15.284
You got shot in your shoulder?

01:19:15.952 --> 01:19:16.385
Am I stupid?

01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:17.485
Am I stupid?

01:19:17.553 --> 01:19:18.553
Am I stupid?

01:19:25.962 --> 01:19:26.962
Nice.

01:19:28.965 --> 01:19:31.600
Where's the diamond, eh?

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:35.571
Where's the diamond, hm?

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:51.553
You.

01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:01.029
But...

01:20:02.999 --> 01:20:03.999
Ugh.

01:20:15.411 --> 01:20:16.411
Yes!

01:20:19.883 --> 01:20:24.320
Who's the boss now, eh?

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:25.088
Eh?

01:20:25.188 --> 01:20:27.123
Look at you, you're dead.

01:20:27.223 --> 01:20:28.791
You're fucking dead!

01:20:28.892 --> 01:20:30.759
Na, na, na, na, na.

01:20:48.077 --> 01:20:54.283
Bastard.

01:20:58.854 --> 01:20:59.855
We have a car.

01:20:59.956 --> 01:21:01.257
Are we all shipshape?

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:01.757
Yeah.

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:02.857
Yeah.

01:21:05.328 --> 01:21:06.595
Splendid.

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:07.496
- Ah.
- Shit.

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:07.997
Fuck.

01:21:08.097 --> 01:21:08.531
I forgot.

01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:09.631
Are you OK?

01:21:09.665 --> 01:21:12.501
Just don't bleed
on my car, will you?

01:21:15.038 --> 01:21:19.175
Whew.

01:21:19.275 --> 01:21:20.809
What you doing here?

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:22.611
What you done to your hand?

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.047
Caught it in a door.

01:21:24.147 --> 01:21:27.116
Fucking retard.

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:28.985
I got tickets for Barbados.

01:21:29.085 --> 01:21:31.420
We've got to leave now
to catch your flight.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:34.023
You're having
a laugh, what, now?

01:21:34.123 --> 01:21:37.193
Yeah, well my passport and
bags are my sister's so.

01:21:37.293 --> 01:21:38.561
We can swing by.

01:21:38.661 --> 01:21:41.397
I've got to see a friend
at a hotel on the way.

01:21:45.368 --> 01:21:46.269
Well, you coming?

01:21:46.369 --> 01:21:48.737
All right, keep
your fucking hair on.

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:55.078
What is it?

01:21:55.178 --> 01:21:56.079
What is that?

01:21:56.179 --> 01:21:57.389
The place has VIPs all the time.

01:21:57.413 --> 01:21:58.014
Don't worry about it.

01:21:58.114 --> 01:22:00.249
Just keep moving.

01:22:03.819 --> 01:22:04.819
We're going upstairs.

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:05.588
Sit down.

01:22:05.688 --> 01:22:06.889
No, no, sit down.

01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:07.856
Do you need me?

01:22:07.957 --> 01:22:09.037
OK, we're going to sit down

01:22:09.092 --> 01:22:10.732
in a normal, unsuspicious way.
Watch this.

01:22:17.733 --> 01:22:19.068
What's in your pockets?

01:22:19.168 --> 01:22:21.637
Nothing.

01:22:21.737 --> 01:22:23.973
Always it's a little
firecracker, OK?

01:22:24.073 --> 01:22:26.775
Jesus, there's a
fucking cop over there.

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:29.145
I know there's a
fucking cop over there.

01:22:29.245 --> 01:22:32.448
It's a... it's a
very small bomb, OK?

01:22:32.548 --> 01:22:34.250
Very small... it's very small.

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:36.195
Fuck's sake, we're going
upstairs to see a princess.

01:22:36.219 --> 01:22:36.785
Shh. Shh.

01:22:36.885 --> 01:22:37.286
Shh.

01:22:37.386 --> 01:22:38.854
Shh.

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:39.788
You don't know. You don't know.

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.133
How well do you
know this princess?

01:22:41.157 --> 01:22:43.259
If you get into trouble,
I am not helping you out.

01:22:43.359 --> 01:22:43.993
Come on.

01:22:44.093 --> 01:22:44.760
Let's go.

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:45.860
Don't tell me what to do.

01:22:50.033 --> 01:22:52.568
Visiting someone at
the Star Plaza Hotel.

01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:54.737
Oh, this is the Premium
Plaza Hotel car park.

01:22:54.837 --> 01:22:56.272
You want our sister hotel?

01:22:56.372 --> 01:22:57.840
That's just five
minutes away, sir.

01:22:57.940 --> 01:22:59.575
It's a common mistake.

01:23:01.144 --> 01:23:04.080
Deacon, you are
a fucking spastic.

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.181
Can you let me in?

01:23:05.281 --> 01:23:05.981
I'll come straight out.

01:23:06.082 --> 01:23:07.183
I can' do a U-turn.

01:23:07.283 --> 01:23:08.893
Yes, but you'll need to
take a ticket to come in.

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:10.495
And then, you'll have to
pay when you come out.

01:23:10.519 --> 01:23:11.863
It doesn't matter here
just for a minute.

01:23:11.887 --> 01:23:12.988
How much?

01:23:13.089 --> 01:23:15.758
Christ on a bike, it
says 10 pound on the sign.

01:23:17.793 --> 01:23:21.964
He's a bit dim, just
like his poor, deceased father.

01:23:22.065 --> 01:23:23.432
So sorry about this.

01:23:24.533 --> 01:23:26.001
Hey, get a move on.

01:23:26.769 --> 01:23:27.770
Thank you so much.

01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:35.544
Hi.

01:23:35.644 --> 01:23:38.881
What about the... the delivery.

01:23:38.981 --> 01:23:39.981
OK, follow me.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:59.935
Katherine, what
are you doing here?

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:01.904
Where's Arkady?

01:24:02.004 --> 01:24:06.309
Uh, well, actually, I
don't work for him anymore.

01:24:06.409 --> 01:24:10.679
But we have your diamond.

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:11.880
You look different.

01:24:16.519 --> 01:24:17.253
Oh, no.

01:24:17.353 --> 01:24:19.155
No, no.

01:24:19.255 --> 01:24:23.359
Nothing like that.

01:24:23.459 --> 01:24:26.629
Oy, moron, where are we going?

01:24:26.729 --> 01:24:29.698
Don't tell me you're fucking
lost in a fucking car park.

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:32.000
We've got to get to the airport.

01:24:32.101 --> 01:24:33.541
I've got to pack my
bags, get sorted.

01:24:33.636 --> 01:24:35.304
What the fuck's going on?

01:24:35.404 --> 01:24:36.539
What?

01:24:36.639 --> 01:24:39.708
I said, what's going on
with you, you fucking moron?

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:41.153
Oh my god, you are
dim, aren't you,

01:24:41.177 --> 01:24:43.212
just like your fucking dad?

01:24:43.312 --> 01:24:44.947
Right nonce he turned out to be.

01:24:45.047 --> 01:24:46.949
13-and-a-half I
was... 13-and-a-half

01:24:47.049 --> 01:24:48.089
when he took my innocence.

01:24:48.151 --> 01:24:49.752
Should have had you
fucking terminated.

01:24:49.852 --> 01:24:51.654
And look what he produced.

01:24:51.754 --> 01:24:52.921
Look at it.

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:56.492
Look at the little shit
he fucking well produced.

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:57.693
Come on, for fuck's sake.

01:24:57.793 --> 01:24:58.361
Ah!

01:24:58.461 --> 01:24:59.461
Get a move... what?

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:01.930
Move.

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.399
Drive the fucking car.

01:25:03.499 --> 01:25:04.900
Move it!

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.403
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

01:25:07.503 --> 01:25:08.871
What the fuck?

01:25:08.971 --> 01:25:09.971
What the...

01:25:17.913 --> 01:25:22.185
Be polite for once in
your life, fucking rude cow!

01:25:28.424 --> 01:25:31.860
Look what you fucking made me
do, you fucking stupid cow.

01:25:43.839 --> 01:25:47.676
Ah, fuck!

01:25:47.776 --> 01:25:49.178
Let me help you with that, sir.

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:03.157
Show me.

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:09.497
Stefan?

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:14.470
Yes, ma'am?

01:26:22.545 --> 01:26:23.912
Stop shaking your leg.

01:26:39.795 --> 01:26:41.273
I'm gonna be back in
one second, all right?

01:26:41.297 --> 01:26:43.031
Paul, no, don't go
in... what are you doing?

01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:43.966
Paul. Paul.

01:26:44.066 --> 01:26:44.733
- Don't.
- Sorry, sir.

01:26:44.833 --> 01:26:45.534
Yeah?

01:26:45.634 --> 01:26:46.702
Can't let you go in there.

01:26:46.802 --> 01:26:48.203
What's, uh, what's shooting?

01:26:48.304 --> 01:26:49.805
Some zombie shit.

01:26:49.905 --> 01:26:52.007
Shooting on the roof.

01:26:52.107 --> 01:26:52.775
Holy fuck.

01:26:52.875 --> 01:26:54.377
Is that Kyle Nathan?

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:00.683
He's tiny.

01:27:00.783 --> 01:27:02.418
He needs a lot of boxes, huh?

01:27:02.518 --> 01:27:05.454
Uh, we're gonna
need a bigger box.

01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:06.865
I'm gonna say hello
to him real quick.

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:08.267
- I can't let you go in there.
- I'm a film producer.

01:27:08.291 --> 01:27:10.034
I've really got to get inside.
That's not going to happen.

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:10.793
You sure?

01:27:10.893 --> 01:27:11.627
Are you sure?

01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:12.595
Yeah, you can't go in there.

01:27:12.695 --> 01:27:13.195
Kyle.

01:27:13.296 --> 01:27:13.996
Kyle.

01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:15.096
Hey, Kyle.

01:27:15.163 --> 01:27:15.898
Kyle?

01:27:15.998 --> 01:27:17.400
Kyle.

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:18.500
Kyle?

01:27:35.518 --> 01:27:36.952
Of course, sir.

01:27:37.052 --> 01:27:40.055
They're filming a
zombie movie on the roof.

01:27:40.155 --> 01:27:41.189
Couldn't give a fuck.

01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:41.957
Right.

01:27:42.057 --> 01:27:42.925
Kyle Nathan's in it.

01:27:43.025 --> 01:27:44.660
I'm sure you give
a fuck now, right?

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:45.528
He's a friend.
No idea who he is.

01:27:45.628 --> 01:27:46.495
- Is he?
- Great friend.

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:48.931
OK.

01:27:49.031 --> 01:27:49.898
You know him?

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:50.866
Yeah.

01:27:50.966 --> 01:27:52.377
I don't wanna bother
him, though, so.

01:27:52.401 --> 01:27:53.201
All right.

01:27:53.302 --> 01:27:55.037
- Never heard of him.
- Really?

01:27:55.137 --> 01:27:55.904
Young guy?

01:27:56.004 --> 01:27:57.239
He's a huge... huge...

01:27:57.340 --> 01:27:58.780
Kicks and punches
and all that stuff.

01:27:58.841 --> 01:28:00.376
Oh, right,

01:28:00.476 --> 01:28:01.796
He's that guy
who jump in the air,

01:28:01.844 --> 01:28:03.187
and he kicks and punches
at the same time.

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:04.079
Ah, right.

01:28:04.179 --> 01:28:05.013
So he hit your
balls in your face.

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:05.881
Oof.

01:28:05.981 --> 01:28:09.818
Pretty incredible.

01:28:09.918 --> 01:28:14.457
Katherine, can
I ask you a question?

01:28:14.557 --> 01:28:16.592
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:28:16.692 --> 01:28:18.561
Got any coke?

01:28:18.661 --> 01:28:19.661
No.

01:28:22.598 --> 01:28:24.433
Weed?

01:28:24.533 --> 01:28:25.533
No.

01:28:35.277 --> 01:28:36.597
All right,
kids, let's look alive.

01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:38.514
Let's go.

01:28:38.614 --> 01:28:46.614
Right.

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:52.127
We take a little
trip to the bathroom.

01:28:52.227 --> 01:28:54.963
Keep your mouths fucking
shut, or I'll fucking

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:56.264
drop the light here right now.

01:28:56.365 --> 01:28:58.901
Now, move, you bunch of
sunglass-wearing cunts.

01:28:59.001 --> 01:29:00.102
- Move!
- What?

01:29:00.202 --> 01:29:02.170
You don't want to get some
tea and talk about it?

01:29:21.624 --> 01:29:26.328
Look at you lot, pack
of fucking cunts.

01:29:26.429 --> 01:29:29.197
Whatever happened to
normal fucking people,

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:37.297
like me and my dad, the
1982 England World Cup team?

01:29:38.073 --> 01:29:46.073
What happened to proper men...

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:49.051
Telly Savalas, Lee Majors...

01:29:49.151 --> 01:29:53.689
Masculine, proper fucking man?

01:29:53.789 --> 01:29:59.495
You, fucking American
cunt, you're first.

01:29:59.595 --> 01:30:01.630
I'm gonna get a
big fucking knife

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:05.167
and stab your fat fucking head...
Stab it so many fucking times,

01:30:05.267 --> 01:30:06.902
it's going explode.

01:30:07.002 --> 01:30:08.336
And then, I'm gonna shoot you.

01:30:08.437 --> 01:30:12.908
I'm gonna shoot you
between the head.

01:30:13.008 --> 01:30:18.981
And you, you devious
four-eyed ugly cow,

01:30:19.081 --> 01:30:24.953
I'm gonna set fire to
your tits with petrol.

01:30:25.053 --> 01:30:28.924
And you, I'm gonna cut
your fucking balls off

01:30:29.024 --> 01:30:33.061
and staple them to
your fucking ears.

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:37.900
And you, Groucho, I'm
gonna cut your dick

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.869
off and turn it into ravioli.

01:30:40.969 --> 01:30:43.672
I'm gonna get this ugly
bastard, this ginger

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:49.478
fuck ugly busted to rape
you with a fucking strap-on.

01:30:49.578 --> 01:30:50.879
He's going to have two cocks?

01:30:50.979 --> 01:30:52.280
Yeah.

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.415
So how does it work?

01:30:53.516 --> 01:30:55.417
Is the strap-on
above the first cock?
