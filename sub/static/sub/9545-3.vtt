You have two levels?

00:33.334 --> 00:34.368
I use this level

It's my

not broken?

That's a good question.

Go back at least 12 months
on everything.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.730
I want everybody's
best game here.

11:36.764 --> 11:37.931
What's that?

11:37.965 --> 11:38.932
A guy with a grudge.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.267
John Delancey.

11:40.299 --> 11:41.433
He's going through
a messy divorce.

11:41.467 --> 11:45.471
Judge Garr ruled against him
three weeks ago.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.374
He started screaming at her
in court.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.775
They had to restrain him.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.243
Why, he hit her car.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.211
Maybe.
There was an incident.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.746
Uh, as she was leaving
the courthouse,

11:53.780 --> 11:55.816
their cars collided,
like a little fender-bender.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.884
He rammed her car.
Was it an accident?

11:57.918 --> 12:00.086
We've got three witnesses,
but nobody's sure.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.288
All we know is she didn't
report it or press charges.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.256
Well, you find this guy.
Find him.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.859
Captain.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.961
Natalie, look,
it's kind of crazy right now.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.197
Say, how's our patient?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.798
He has the flu.

12:11.831 --> 12:12.832
What's he doing about it?

12:12.865 --> 12:14.500
Complaining.
Driving me nuts.

12:14.533 --> 12:16.269
Any news
on the Julio Alvarez case?

12:16.302 --> 12:20.340
Um...ask Disher about that.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.278
Lieutenant, the Captain
said you could fill me in.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.815
Yeah, well,
we don't know much.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.282
She owns a beach house.

12:29.316 --> 12:32.052
We're sending another
forensics team down there now.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.186
Not the judge,
the other case.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.386
Alvarez.
Who?

12:34.421 --> 12:35.522
Julio Alvarez.

12:35.554 --> 12:36.789
You didn't let me finish.

12:36.823 --> 12:38.024
Who-lio Alvarez.

12:38.057 --> 12:39.426
The delivery guy.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.894
Yeah, right.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.863
Jenkins, who caught
the pizza thing?

12:42.895 --> 12:44.932
"The pizza thing"?
He had a name, Randy.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.533
He might not have been a judge,
but he had a name.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.201
Hey, I resent that.
I really do.

12:49.235 --> 12:52.272
Every case is important here.
We don't play favorites.

12:52.304 --> 12:53.874
I've got the file
right here.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.241
Good.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.111
Somewhere.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.114
Sergeant, have you seen
the Alvarez file?

13:01.148 --> 13:03.149
Yeah, I just saw it.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.224
Who's this?

13:11.258 --> 13:12.225
That's the victim.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.592
Julio Alvarez.

13:13.625 --> 13:16.528
No.
No, this isn't the guy.

13:16.562 --> 13:18.431
Natalie, that's the guy.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.932
There's his employee I.D.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.134
He's dead.
He's in the morgue.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.936
That's not the man
that came to the door.

13:22.970 --> 13:23.870
Okay, look, you said

13:23.903 --> 13:25.072
you only got a glimpse
of him last night.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.139
I mean, that's the guy.
Is that from the judge's house?

13:27.173 --> 13:28.140
Captain's office.

13:28.174 --> 13:30.342
I gotta go.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.544
That's not the guy.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.629
(Mr. Gorman)
Look, I already
talked to the cops.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.099
I barely knew the kid.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.900
He started, like,
two or three weeks ago.

13:53.933 --> 13:56.068
You didn't put
his picture up or flowers?

13:56.102 --> 13:58.238
The boss wanted us
to downplay the whole thing.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.405
Said it was bad
for business.

13:59.438 --> 14:00.974
Mr. Gorman,
I'm not sure the man

14:01.008 --> 14:03.375
who came to my house last night
was Julio Alvarez.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.445
Sure it was.
Who else could it be?

14:05.477 --> 14:07.147
"Natalie Tee-jer"?
Teeger.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.414
"Pepperoni,
extra cheese"?

14:08.447 --> 14:09.316
Is that you?
Yeah.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.951
I put it in the car,
the kid drove away.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.019
Was he alone?

14:13.052 --> 14:14.586
Sure he was alone.
Hey, Tommy!

14:14.620 --> 14:16.389
Not too much garlic
on the calzone!

14:16.423 --> 14:17.389
Okay, okay!

14:17.423 --> 14:19.359
Hey, can I see those?
Why?

14:19.392 --> 14:21.394
I'd like to see where he went
before he got to my house.

14:21.427 --> 14:22.929
Are you a cop?

14:22.962 --> 14:24.898
No.
'Cause I got work to do.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.134
Well, I'm not a cop,
but I work for a detective.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.434
Adrian Monk.

14:28.467 --> 14:29.235
Who?

14:29.269 --> 14:32.272
Adrian Monk.
He's a great detective.

14:32.304 --> 14:33.605
He's, like, a genius.

14:33.639 --> 14:35.307
You can ask anybody.

14:35.341 --> 14:36.442
[cell phone rings]

14:36.475 --> 14:37.409
Hold on.

14:37.443 --> 14:38.644
Ah, this is him now.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.447
Stay here.
I want him to talk to you.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.313
Hello.

14:41.347 --> 14:42.315
Natalie...

14:42.349 --> 14:44.451
Natalie, it is me,

14:44.484 --> 14:45.418
Adrian Monk.

14:45.451 --> 14:47.988
Yes, Mr. Monk.
We were just talking about you.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.456
[coughing]

14:49.489 --> 14:51.991
Natalie, you have
to come...back.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.493
Mr. Monk,
I can't right now.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.461
I'm at the pizzeria,
talking to the manager.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.163
It's Ebola.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.565
Excuse me?

14:58.597 --> 15:01.467
I have the Ebola virus.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.570
Mr. Monk, you don't
have the Ebola virus.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.004
Oh, I'm pretty sure I do.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.506
I have all the symptoms.

15:07.539 --> 15:10.342
I have the fever
and the headache

15:10.376 --> 15:12.980
and the massive
internal bleeding.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.215
You have massive
internal bleeding?

15:15.248 --> 15:18.150
Mmm. I believe I do.

15:18.184 --> 15:19.552
That is my opinion.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.488
No, Mr. Monk,
you have the flu.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.990
But I'm glad you called.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.125
I'm talking to Mr. Gorman.
He's the manager.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.259
Hold on.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.729
Hello.

15:29.761 --> 15:31.364
I don't know.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.066
I think they're
in Atlanta.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.334
What's he talking about?

15:34.366 --> 15:36.503
He's asking about the Center
for Disease Control.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.671
[scoffs]

15:44.076 --> 15:45.378
He was a good guy.

15:48.414 --> 15:49.581
Good luck.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.951
Thank you.

15:56.688 --> 15:59.192
Delancey.
John Delancey.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.327
We know he's in there.
We just talked to his assistant.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.996
You understand
this is a private club.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.331
Unless you have
a warrant--

16:05.365 --> 16:07.000
Well...
how about this?

16:07.033 --> 16:10.202
We wait here, and you
go in there and get him.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.370
I can't do that.

16:11.403 --> 16:13.340
Can't or won't?

16:13.373 --> 16:14.640
A little of each.

16:14.673 --> 16:17.677
[pager beeps]

16:25.485 --> 16:27.553
Delancey,
table six.

16:27.586 --> 16:29.556
Seating chart,
table six.

16:29.588 --> 16:31.357
Over there.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.165
Don't get up.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.134
I'm Leland Stottlemeyer,
Homicide.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.402
This is Lieutenant Disher.

16:42.434 --> 16:44.770
We wanna talk to you
about Jillian Garr.

16:44.803 --> 16:46.405
Who?

16:49.775 --> 16:51.411
Judge Jillian Garr.

16:51.443 --> 16:52.778
You threatened her
in court,

16:52.812 --> 16:54.813
and then you rammed her car
in a parking lot.

16:54.846 --> 16:56.548
And now she's missing.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.184
What are you
talking about?

16:58.217 --> 16:59.786
Captain...

16:59.818 --> 17:01.653
Hang on, Randy.

17:01.687 --> 17:05.825
Hey, you like
"tie" food?

17:05.857 --> 17:10.230
Huh?
How's your memory now?

17:10.262 --> 17:13.400
[whispering]
Captain, this
isn't table six.

17:13.432 --> 17:16.135
Chart was
upside down.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.476
Um...

17:29.415 --> 17:31.483
I, uh...

17:31.518 --> 17:33.086
I'm sorry.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.422
I, um, I made a mistake.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.757
I thought you were
somebody else.

17:37.789 --> 17:38.825
Uh...hey, look.

17:38.857 --> 17:41.127
Uh, here.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.395
Take my--
my tie.

17:43.430 --> 17:46.499
This is a--
it's a $100 tie.

17:46.532 --> 17:48.535
It was a Christmas gift.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.202
Okay?

17:52.805 --> 17:54.540
There.

17:57.809 --> 17:59.578
Get out of here.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.653
We'll talk
about this later.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.221
Where is table six?

18:09.256 --> 18:10.390
Okay, uh...

18:12.424 --> 18:15.394
Hold on.

18:16.395 --> 18:18.198
Here's the window.

18:21.468 --> 18:22.669
Oh.

18:22.701 --> 18:24.737
My bad.
That was table six.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.506
I was right.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.478
Are you sure?

18:31.510 --> 18:32.545
Yeah.

18:34.480 --> 18:38.417
Look, I just
gave him my tie.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.921
Plus...I've lost a little bit
of authority with him.

18:41.953 --> 18:43.323
No, I don't think so.

18:43.355 --> 18:44.523
No, you don't think so?

18:44.557 --> 18:47.193
Well, I'm sure
he'll understand.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.729
Everybody makes
mistakes, sir.

18:49.761 --> 18:52.199
[sighs]

18:58.704 --> 19:02.942
Hello again.
Um...

19:02.974 --> 19:06.813
This is
a little embarrassing,

19:06.846 --> 19:09.481
but I'm gonna have
to ask for my tie back.

19:09.516 --> 19:10.849
You gave it to me.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.452
Well, look, if you're gonna wear
such a nice tie,

19:13.486 --> 19:15.355
you gotta wear it straight.

19:15.387 --> 19:19.425
You don't wear
a nice tie like that crooked.

19:19.459 --> 19:20.393
Okay now,
where were we?

19:20.426 --> 19:25.332
Yeah, we were talking
about Jillian Garr.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.933
[gasps for air]

19:27.967 --> 19:31.503
She cost me $2.5 million.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.306
I admit it.
I lost my temper.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.673
You rammed her car.

19:34.707 --> 19:35.775
I wasn't trying
to hurt anybody.

19:35.807 --> 19:38.411
I was pissed off.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.712
You know, you boys are asking
the wrong question here.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.583
You should be asking
"Why didn't she press charges?"

19:43.615 --> 19:46.452
Okay, why didn't
she press charges?

19:46.486 --> 19:47.854
Because she wasn't alone.

19:47.886 --> 19:49.622
There was a man
with her in the car.

19:49.655 --> 19:50.423
I saw them kissing.

19:50.457 --> 19:53.593
When I hit her,
he got out and ran.

19:53.625 --> 19:54.594
He didn't want to be seen.

19:54.626 --> 19:56.395
He was married.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.265
She was seeing
a married guy.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.365
Good guess.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.935
Now, could you
find my waiter?

20:03.970 --> 20:05.672
I'm going to need
another plate.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.807
[groaning]

20:08.840 --> 20:10.876
Eat your soup.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.412
Uhhh.

20:12.444 --> 20:13.680
I see letters.

20:13.712 --> 20:17.016
Yeah,
it's alphabet soup.
Oh.

20:17.048 --> 20:21.421
"A."
You don't have
to eat it in order.

20:21.453 --> 20:22.521
[groans]

20:26.459 --> 20:28.295
Where's Julie's card?

20:28.327 --> 20:30.930
I put it
in the recycle bin.

20:30.962 --> 20:32.531
They just collected it.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.833
Julie is so proud
of that card.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.535
What am I supposed
to tell her?

20:35.567 --> 20:39.506
Tell her that recycling
is important.

20:39.538 --> 20:43.410
And that together,
we're saving the planet.

20:43.442 --> 20:44.810
"B."

20:44.844 --> 20:46.712
Can I just talk about the case
for one minute please?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.548
So I've been thinking
about this.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.016
The man at the door
was wearing

20:50.048 --> 20:52.285
a baseball cap and sunglasses.

20:52.318 --> 20:53.420
Sunglasses at night.

20:53.452 --> 20:55.654
It was like he was trying
to hide his face from me.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.689
Do you think
it means something?

20:56.722 --> 21:00.492
I don't know.
Ahhh...

21:00.527 --> 21:04.663
Ah...false alarm.
That's a broken "Q."

21:04.696 --> 21:07.433
Mr. Monk,
this is important to me.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.403
All right, so he left
the pizzeria at 7:05.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.471
He didn't get here
until 7:40,

21:12.505 --> 21:13.405
and the pizza
was cold, remember?

21:13.440 --> 21:14.740
Cold.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.375
Yeah, that's right.
What do you think it means?

21:16.409 --> 21:18.744
Cold.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.046
Do you think it's important?

21:20.078 --> 21:21.713
I'm so cold.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.383
[sighs]

21:23.415 --> 21:25.684
All right, he had two other
stops before he got here.

21:25.718 --> 21:26.685
I got the addresses.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.454
I'm gonna retrace
his steps.

21:28.488 --> 21:31.458
No, no, no, no.
No, Natalie.

21:31.490 --> 21:33.393
Just let
the police handle it.

21:33.425 --> 21:34.426
They don't care
about this kid.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.795
They can't even
remember his name.

21:35.827 --> 21:37.930
And they sure as hell don't care
about what I think.

21:37.963 --> 21:38.931
All they care about is

21:38.964 --> 21:41.067
this missing judge.

21:41.099 --> 21:44.336
Mr. Monk, I need you
to come with me.

21:44.371 --> 21:45.938
I can't.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.807
Yes, you can.
You can rally.

21:47.839 --> 21:50.477
Hey, Mitch was
a football player.

21:50.509 --> 21:51.778
Players got injured
all the time.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.814
He always said,
"The great ones play hurt."

21:54.846 --> 21:57.549
Mr. Monk, I can't
do this without you.

21:57.584 --> 22:00.353
Just sit in the car.
It'll just take an hour.

22:00.386 --> 22:03.355
[stifling coughs]

22:03.390 --> 22:05.124
I can't.

22:05.156 --> 22:07.693
Well, I'm going.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.596
A man was killed,
and he was here.

22:09.628 --> 22:10.328
I have to do something.

22:10.363 --> 22:14.601
No...no.
Natalie, you can't go.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.935
You can't just leave.

22:16.969 --> 22:19.838
Vaporizer one
is empty.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.442
I'm almost
out of ice.

22:22.474 --> 22:24.943
You have
to do your job.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.746
I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.
I can't.

22:26.778 --> 22:29.015
I'm too busy
doing your job.

22:37.957 --> 22:41.627
They were having a sleepover.
We ordered three pizzas.

22:41.661 --> 22:43.162
(Kevin)
One Hawaiian, one pepperoni--

22:43.194 --> 22:44.596
(Kyle)
And one veggie master.

22:44.631 --> 22:45.632
Is this him?

22:45.664 --> 22:47.599
Are you sure?

22:47.634 --> 22:49.701
Yeah, the police were here.

22:49.736 --> 22:50.970
They had the same picture.

22:51.002 --> 22:52.739
That's definitely him.

22:52.771 --> 22:54.673
We felt terrible
about it.

22:54.707 --> 22:55.942
Was he wearing
a hat or sunglasses?

22:55.974 --> 22:58.009
No.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.512
[rings doorbell]

23:00.547 --> 23:02.147
Hello.
Hi.

23:02.181 --> 23:03.148
Can I help you?

23:03.182 --> 23:04.651
Sorry to bother you.

23:04.683 --> 23:05.718
I hope this isn't
a bad time.

23:05.751 --> 23:06.586
Uh, as a matter of fact,

23:06.618 --> 23:08.721
I'm sort of
in the middle of something.

23:17.195 --> 23:20.432
Why?

23:20.467 --> 23:22.634
What is all this about?

23:22.669 --> 23:23.702
Really sorry to bother you.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.203
I live a few blocks away.
Yeah.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.574
I've seen you around.

23:27.606 --> 23:30.876
Yeah...it's
about my cat Snowflake.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.044
She's run away.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.580
Your cat.
Do you have a picture?

23:34.614 --> 23:37.048
No, see, that's the thing.
She's new.

23:37.083 --> 23:40.586
So...thanks anyway.
Sorry to bother you.

23:40.619 --> 23:42.454
Hold on.

23:42.489 --> 23:44.022
You know what?
I did find a cat.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.023
This morning.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.959
She was scratching
my front door.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.760
She's down
in the basement.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.529
Come on in.
No, it's probably
not her.

23:50.563 --> 23:51.463
What color is it?
White.

23:51.498 --> 23:53.599
See, it can't be her.
Snowflake's black.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.634
Snowflake is black?

23:55.667 --> 23:58.037
Yeah, thanks anyway.

23:58.069 --> 24:01.708
You really should put
some ice on that thumb.

24:01.740 --> 24:02.942
He had a what?

24:02.974 --> 24:04.143
(Natalie)
A bruise on his thumb.

24:04.175 --> 24:05.778
I remember the guy

24:05.811 --> 24:07.646
that delivered Julie's pizza
had the same bruise.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.515
Uh-huh.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.249
He tried to get me
in his house.

24:10.281 --> 24:12.618
Maybe he likes you.
Maybe he finds you attractive.

24:12.652 --> 24:13.519
Stranger things
have happened.

24:13.553 --> 24:16.087
No, he wanted to kill me.
I can tell.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.856
Can't you get
a search warrant?

24:17.890 --> 24:19.157
No, not based on this.

24:19.191 --> 24:21.760
I mean, the guy's got
a nice house, right?

24:21.794 --> 24:23.630
And he's got some money?

24:23.663 --> 24:25.064
Why would he kill
a pizza delivery guy?

24:25.096 --> 24:26.499
I don't know.

24:26.532 --> 24:27.834
Even if he did kill him,

24:27.866 --> 24:29.035
why would he drive
across town

24:29.067 --> 24:30.236
and deliver Julie's pizza
to her?

24:30.269 --> 24:31.237
Doesn't make sense.

24:31.269 --> 24:32.505
Well, can't you at least

24:32.538 --> 24:33.740
come down here
and talk to him?

24:33.772 --> 24:36.843
Yeah, I can be there
in two hours.

24:36.875 --> 24:38.877
No, no!
He could be gone by then.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.547
Where's the Captain?

24:40.579 --> 24:41.748
He's working on the case.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.148
Not your case.
The other case.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.150
The big case.

24:44.182 --> 24:46.618
She left the courthouse
at 4:45.

24:46.653 --> 24:49.588
She was last seen
driving north on the 101

24:49.622 --> 24:51.222
by a surveillance camera
right here.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.559
She was alone
in the car.

24:53.593 --> 24:54.961
Uh, it's not centered.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.228
That one.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.936
Good.
Good.

25:07.773 --> 25:11.611
Okay now, her car was found
in a parking lot here.

25:11.644 --> 25:14.079
It was unlocked.
It had been wiped clean.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.816
There were no prints.
No fibers.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.618
I got some photographs here.

25:19.652 --> 25:22.855
Oh no, wait.
I can't see.

25:22.888 --> 25:25.223
I can't focus.
I can't see.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.693
Okay, you'll look
at the pictures later.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.628
Could you turn this?

25:29.662 --> 25:33.766
Thank you.
That's good.

25:33.799 --> 25:34.767
What is this thing?

25:34.800 --> 25:36.067
It's a humidifier.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.770
What's that one?

25:38.805 --> 25:41.807
It's a dehumidifier.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.648
Well, don't they
cancel each other out?

25:49.682 --> 25:51.150
Exactly.

25:53.653 --> 25:56.888
Um, we know that
she was seeing somebody.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.691
He might be married.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.626
You can tell
by her credit card records

26:00.660 --> 26:04.063
that they went on a trip
together in February.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.998
They went to Oakley, Idaho
February 10th,

26:06.031 --> 26:08.601
for two weeks.

26:08.634 --> 26:11.738
He's not married.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.271
He's not married?
No.

26:13.305 --> 26:16.008
How do you know that?
[blows nose loudly]

26:21.047 --> 26:24.616
Monk, how do you know
he's not married?

26:24.651 --> 26:28.820
Well, they were there
on Valentine's Day.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.656
If he was married,
he woulda stayed home.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.692
Yep, you're right.

26:32.724 --> 26:34.393
I need a baggie.

26:34.425 --> 26:35.662
They're in the drawer.

26:38.931 --> 26:43.269
Monk, can you
focus here please?

26:43.301 --> 26:47.138
Okay, okay, okay.
Monk, focus here, would you?

26:47.173 --> 26:48.775
Zip it.
Why are--

26:48.807 --> 26:49.776
Zip it.

26:49.808 --> 26:51.911
Why keep it a secret?

26:51.943 --> 26:55.381
I'm gonna need
another baggie.

26:55.413 --> 26:56.382
You're gonna put this baggie

26:56.414 --> 27:00.720
into another baggie.

27:00.752 --> 27:03.055
This big baggie?

27:03.088 --> 27:05.391
That's the one.

27:05.423 --> 27:07.125
Okay, Monk,
stay with me here, okay?

27:07.159 --> 27:09.996
She's a judge.

27:10.028 --> 27:13.132
So maybe he was someone
that she was not allowed--

27:13.164 --> 27:15.968
To see socially.

27:16.001 --> 27:18.369
Yes, like a lawyer is someone
who might be involved

27:18.403 --> 27:19.705
in one of her cases.

27:19.739 --> 27:20.873
A conflict of interest.

27:20.906 --> 27:22.273
Make sure it's airtight.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.143
You gotta zip it.

27:24.175 --> 27:26.813
Natalie usually
folds it twice.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.715
First you zip it.
Then you fold it.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.182
First you gotta
get the air out.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.419
You gotta let
the air out first.

27:33.451 --> 27:34.854
Let the air out first.

27:34.886 --> 27:38.423
[bag pops]

27:38.457 --> 27:42.694
Monk, I know you
probably can't tell

27:42.729 --> 27:44.931
because I'm hiding
it so well,

27:44.963 --> 27:50.836
but I really
don't like this.

27:55.974 --> 27:58.076
[crickets chirping]

28:47.826 --> 28:50.829
[phone rings]

28:56.301 --> 28:57.269
Hello.

28:57.302 --> 28:58.470
(Natalie)
Mr. Monk,

28:58.503 --> 29:01.874
I found the guy
who delivered Julie's pizza.

29:01.907 --> 29:05.076
It's definitely him.
His name is Reggie Dennison.

29:05.111 --> 29:09.515
Uh, Natalie,
I've been calling you.

29:09.548 --> 29:10.817
I know.
I didn't answer.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.818
I knew you'd try
to talk me out of this.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.787
Out of what?

29:14.820 --> 29:17.489
I'm in his house.

29:17.522 --> 29:20.459
You're in his house?

29:20.491 --> 29:23.128
He put something in his car.
I couldn't make it out.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.130
And then he drove off.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.998
You're in his house?

29:26.031 --> 29:28.835
I didn't know what else to do.
No one was listening to me.

29:28.867 --> 29:32.403
Oh Natalie,
you're in his house?

29:32.438 --> 29:34.240
Listen.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.875
Get outta there.

29:36.909 --> 29:42.480
Can you pick up some cough drops
on your way back?

29:42.513 --> 29:45.183
But get out of there!

29:45.217 --> 29:46.551
Don't forget the cough drops.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.153
I'm not leaving here
until I find it.

29:48.186 --> 29:49.221
Find what?

29:49.255 --> 29:50.422
I don't know.
I don't know.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.923
I just--I need proof.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.125
Mr. Monk,
just please help me.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.526
I don't know
what I'm looking for.

29:54.559 --> 29:56.461
The fireplace.

29:56.494 --> 29:59.597
He was burning something.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.433
Hold on.
Hold on.

30:02.468 --> 30:05.604
There's one.
It's him.

30:05.636 --> 30:07.973
He's with a woman,
but I can't make it out.

30:08.007 --> 30:10.308
They're at a hotel.
The Oakley Inn.

30:10.342 --> 30:17.849
Whoa, uh, Oakley Inn?
Oakley Inn.

30:17.884 --> 30:22.153
Natalie, is--is this guy
a lawyer?

30:25.490 --> 30:27.192
Okay now,
how did you know that?

30:27.226 --> 30:29.095
[sniffs]

30:29.127 --> 30:30.229
I smell something.

30:30.261 --> 30:32.230
It's bleach.

30:37.135 --> 30:40.205
[sniffs]
Whew!

30:40.239 --> 30:42.273
Okay, I'm in the bathroom.

30:42.307 --> 30:44.109
He must have just cleaned it.

30:44.143 --> 30:48.247
It smells like...
It smells like your bathroom.

30:48.279 --> 30:50.548
Is--is--is there blood?

30:50.582 --> 30:51.650
Oh God.

30:51.682 --> 30:55.554
Um, no.

30:58.124 --> 31:00.125
That's weird.
There's no shower curtain.

31:00.159 --> 31:04.096
Is there a light switch
on the wall?

31:04.130 --> 31:05.096
Yes.

31:05.131 --> 31:06.664
Is it on or off?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.034
It's off.

31:08.067 --> 31:11.002
Well, switch it on.
Be careful.

31:11.037 --> 31:13.505
Use a wipe or something.

31:23.515 --> 31:24.450
It's blood.

31:24.482 --> 31:29.454
Oh yeah, they always
forget the light switch.

31:31.589 --> 31:34.559
[coughing]

31:34.593 --> 31:37.496
[car door closes]

31:37.528 --> 31:38.564
[car alarm beeps]

31:40.665 --> 31:42.468
[whispers]
Oh God...

31:50.576 --> 31:54.546
[Monk coughing on phone]

32:15.201 --> 32:23.041
Natalie,
here's what happened.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.711
This lawyer, Dennison,

32:25.743 --> 32:27.346
was having an affair

32:27.378 --> 32:29.381
with Judge Garr.

32:29.414 --> 32:32.651
She came
to his house last night.

32:32.683 --> 32:38.557
And at some point
they decided to order a pizza.

32:38.589 --> 32:40.558
Somehow things turned ugly.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.028
Maybe they had a fight.

32:42.060 --> 32:45.330
We'll probably never know
what it was about.

32:45.364 --> 32:48.666
But he killed her.

32:48.700 --> 32:52.070
He killed her
in that bathroom.

32:52.104 --> 32:57.209
But the delivery guy Julio

32:57.242 --> 33:00.645
must have seen the attack
or heard something.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.248
And he tried to help her.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.584
He died trying to save her.

33:05.616 --> 33:10.588
Natalie, I'm gonna need
those cough drops.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.723
Not the menthol.
You--you--you know the kind.

33:16.494 --> 33:19.798
Anyway,
Dennison had a problem.

33:19.830 --> 33:23.269
The pizzeria
knew Julio's route.

33:23.301 --> 33:25.770
And Dennison knew that
if Julio just disappeared,

33:25.804 --> 33:30.041
the cops would focus on him.

33:30.076 --> 33:33.412
They'd poke around.
They'd ask a lot of questions.

33:33.444 --> 33:38.584
So he needed somebody else
to be the last person

33:38.616 --> 33:42.288
who saw Julio alive.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.124
He decided to deliver
one more pizza

33:45.156 --> 33:48.826
as Julio, to divert attention
from himself.

33:48.859 --> 33:50.695
You were right, Natalie.

33:50.729 --> 33:55.567
Julio didn't deliver
that pizza.

33:55.601 --> 33:58.336
The man who killed him did.

33:58.369 --> 34:01.106
He was smart,
but he made two mistakes.

34:01.140 --> 34:04.576
Big mistakes.

34:04.609 --> 34:07.679
One, that blood you found
on the bathroom light switch.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.849
If that's the judge's blood,
and I think it is,

34:10.882 --> 34:13.518
he's going to jail for life.

34:13.552 --> 34:16.322
But even without that blood,
we can still convict him.

34:19.757 --> 34:23.561
Mistake number two,
his fingerprints are

34:23.594 --> 34:26.264
all over that pizza box
he delivered.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.871
It's at the recycling dump.

34:32.903 --> 34:37.409
I'm sure they can find it
if they have to.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.177
They just collected it
this morning.

34:39.210 --> 34:42.813
Oh, that's my other line.
Hold on.

34:42.847 --> 34:44.882
[whispers]
Mr. Monk.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.418
Natalie, I'll call ya back.
I'm on the other line.

34:47.452 --> 34:50.356
No, don't...

34:50.389 --> 34:52.391
Where was I?

34:56.661 --> 34:57.663
Oh...

34:59.597 --> 35:01.400
Natalie?

35:04.436 --> 35:06.871
Natalie?

35:06.905 --> 35:08.340
Are you okay?

35:08.373 --> 35:11.543
Say one word
to anybody,

35:11.577 --> 35:12.577
she's dead.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.413
Understand?

35:51.817 --> 35:53.385
Please.
I have a daughter.

35:53.418 --> 35:55.420
Help me find it,
maybe you'll see her again.

35:55.454 --> 35:57.623
Find what?
The box!
The box!

35:57.655 --> 35:59.657
The pizza box
with my prints on it.

35:59.690 --> 36:02.494
What was it in?
A carton, a bag, or what?

36:02.527 --> 36:03.695
My boss recycled it.

36:03.728 --> 36:06.664
He separates everything into
piles exactly 20 inches high.

36:06.697 --> 36:08.800
Then he puts each pile
into a green, 10-gallon

36:08.833 --> 36:12.670
reinforced double-ply trash bag,
which he double-tapes shut.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.672
Then he puts that bag
into another bag,

36:14.706 --> 36:16.608
which he wraps with twine
four times counterclockwise

36:16.641 --> 36:18.409
and ties
each end twice.

36:18.443 --> 36:20.646
Once he's completed that--
Are you screwing
with me?

36:20.679 --> 36:23.548
No, I swear.
He's very persnickety.

36:23.581 --> 36:24.715
All right.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.820
He said that it was
picked up this morning.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.389
We'll start there.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.670
Look down here.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.336
I don't see it.

37:18.369 --> 37:20.572
You're stalling.
I'm not.
I swear to God.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.407
I'm gonna give you
one more chance

37:22.440 --> 37:23.909
to help me find
the damn box.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.777
Ahh!
[screams]

38:14.726 --> 38:15.726
Ah!

38:25.471 --> 38:27.539
Where's Monk?

38:27.572 --> 38:28.539
Where is he?

38:28.574 --> 38:33.744
Get him up.
Where is he?

38:33.778 --> 38:36.981
[sneezes]

38:37.014 --> 38:38.550
(Disher)
Get him outta here.

38:53.632 --> 38:57.436
[coughing]
Is it all off?

38:57.469 --> 39:01.373
I think so.
Yep, good as new.

39:01.407 --> 39:02.840
Is he talking?

39:02.873 --> 39:04.842
He's a lawyer,
so, yeah.

39:04.876 --> 39:08.579
He says that you brought him
here at knifepoint.

39:08.614 --> 39:09.748
What?

39:09.780 --> 39:11.048
He says that you've
been stalking him.

39:11.081 --> 39:12.050
And that you're crazy.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.050
You were
in his house.

39:13.083 --> 39:14.786
You can't let him go.

39:14.820 --> 39:17.088
As of this moment,
we have no physical evidence

39:17.121 --> 39:18.088
to connect that man

39:18.123 --> 39:19.724
to either of the murders.

39:19.757 --> 39:20.592
What about the pizza box?

39:20.626 --> 39:22.760
Well, if we could find
the pizza box,

39:22.793 --> 39:24.396
and it came
from Monk's house,

39:24.429 --> 39:25.963
and it has
his fingerprints on it,

39:25.996 --> 39:27.733
well then,
it's a slam dunk.

39:27.766 --> 39:29.134
We're not
gonna find it.

39:29.166 --> 39:30.635
Forget it.
I talked to the manager.

39:30.668 --> 39:32.871
They don't keep
any records.

39:32.903 --> 39:34.105
They could've
dumped it anywhere.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.673
I mean,
look at this place.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.509
There's two
more warehouses,
Shh.

39:37.543 --> 39:38.643
and there's
more outside.

39:38.677 --> 39:39.710
What?

39:42.012 --> 39:44.382
Shhh,
everybody...

40:01.467 --> 40:03.902
Polly Wolly Doodle.

40:03.934 --> 40:07.739
*

40:07.773 --> 40:09.440
Oh my God.
It's Julie's card.

40:09.474 --> 40:10.742
It has a musical chip.

40:19.150 --> 40:22.621
Polly Wolly Doodle.

40:22.653 --> 40:28.659
*

40:38.969 --> 40:40.038
Wait--wait--wait.

40:40.070 --> 40:43.708
Don't open it.
Wait for forensics.

40:43.742 --> 40:47.679
You got outta bed?

40:47.713 --> 40:49.681
You took a taxi?

40:49.715 --> 40:54.519
In your bathrobe.

40:54.552 --> 40:56.922
Mitch was right.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.856
The great ones play hurt.

41:14.005 --> 41:15.840
Good morning.

41:15.873 --> 41:17.141
What are you doing?

41:17.175 --> 41:18.909
Just sitting.

41:18.943 --> 41:20.778
Outside?

41:20.811 --> 41:24.114
It's a beautiful day.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.851
I feel fine.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.251
Much better.

41:27.284 --> 41:28.920
Okay.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.722
So I just talked
to the Captain.

41:30.755 --> 41:31.956
They found the judge's body.

41:31.989 --> 41:34.159
Reggie Dennison
confessed to everything.

41:34.192 --> 41:38.697
He even showed them
where the body was.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.231
Really, what are
you doing out here?

41:40.264 --> 41:42.067
You hate outside.

41:42.099 --> 41:44.101
Maybe I've changed.

41:49.039 --> 41:51.076
Seriously, what are
you doing out here?
[scoffs]

41:58.717 --> 42:01.686
