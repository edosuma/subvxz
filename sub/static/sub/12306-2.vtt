00:02.330 --> 00:05.868
Second girl: We're meeting
at tara's at midnight.

00:05.870 --> 00:07.122
Her parents
are in cabo.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.199
I can't. I'm
babysitting my brother.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.360
Mom is on a date
with a stockbroker.

00:11.370 --> 00:16.001
My mom is dating a yogi
who only eats raw. [thud]

00:16.010 --> 00:18.308
Thomas, you better
be in that bed.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.005
I will tell mom.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.614
I think
my brother is up.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.145
[thud]

00:24.150 --> 00:26.744
Damn it, thomas.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.156
That's weird.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.252
What?

00:32.259 --> 00:33.455
I heard something.

00:33.460 --> 00:36.498
What is it?

00:36.500 --> 00:38.423
Maybe it's
your stalker.

00:38.430 --> 00:39.829
No one believes me.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.968
I swear someone has
been following me around.

00:41.970 --> 00:44.268
They were lurking in
the back yard last week.

00:44.270 --> 00:45.806
You don't
have a stalker.

00:45.810 --> 00:47.505
Famous people have
stalkers.

00:47.510 --> 00:49.239
You have a creeper
with a crush.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.049
That qualifies
as a stalker.

00:52.050 --> 00:53.074
Chill out, hannah.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.048
Don't flatter yourself.

00:55.050 --> 00:57.417
[footsteps]

00:57.420 --> 01:00.185
What's going on?

01:00.190 --> 01:03.979
I heard something.
Don't hang up.

01:03.990 --> 01:06.425
Ok. I'm here.

01:19.010 --> 01:21.274
Talk to me, hannah.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.848
Hannah, you're
scaring me.

01:25.850 --> 01:27.272
Hannah?

01:27.280 --> 01:27.940
Shh!

01:27.950 --> 01:29.748
Hannah, what's
going on?

01:29.750 --> 01:32.617
I don't know.

01:35.490 --> 01:38.687
Hannah, what's
going on?

01:38.690 --> 01:40.749
The door is open.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.956
Are you serious?

01:43.670 --> 01:46.162
Do you see anything?

01:53.780 --> 01:56.374
[deadbolt clicks]

01:56.380 --> 01:57.779
[sighs]

01:57.780 --> 02:00.647
[creak]

02:00.650 --> 02:02.675
I think someone
is in the house.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.169
Oh, my god,
get out of there.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.215
I can't. I can't
leave without thomas.

02:06.220 --> 02:08.449
If anything happens,
call 911.

02:08.460 --> 02:11.327
[panting]

02:11.990 --> 02:14.459
Thomas? Thomas?

02:14.460 --> 02:16.349
Thomas, where are you?

02:16.370 --> 02:19.192
What are you doing,
trying to scare me to death?

02:19.200 --> 02:23.262
There's someone
in the house.

02:23.270 --> 02:25.568
Girl: Talk to me.
What's happening? Hannah?

02:25.570 --> 02:26.708
I'm calling
the police.

02:26.710 --> 02:29.031
Yes, yes. Call the police.
I don't know what to do.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.270
Get out of the house,
hannah, now!

02:31.280 --> 02:33.806
Get out of the house!

02:33.820 --> 02:35.015
Aah! Aah!

02:35.020 --> 02:37.148
Oh, my god,
he's in the house!

02:37.150 --> 02:40.916
[both screaming]

02:41.560 --> 02:44.655
Help! Help! Help!

02:44.660 --> 02:47.652
Somebody help us!

02:47.660 --> 02:50.789
Help!

03:39.010 --> 03:42.310
[door opens and closes]

03:42.320 --> 03:43.810
A peck or a kiss?

03:43.820 --> 03:45.709
A longish kiss.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.040
He wanted it
to go further,

03:47.060 --> 03:47.845
But it was late,

03:47.860 --> 03:49.817
And I had to open up
this morning.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.252
You gonna
see him again?

03:51.260 --> 03:54.184
No. He was nice, but
there was no chemistry.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.999
But you had fun.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.468
How'd you sleep?

03:58.470 --> 04:00.962
Great--
no psycho dreams,

04:00.970 --> 04:02.961
No bob standing
over the bed

04:02.970 --> 04:06.861
Because he's in prison and
he will never hurt you again.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.530
I know.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.305
Look. Keep dating.
Keep it light.

04:11.310 --> 04:14.769
Have fun.
Have crazy sex.

04:14.780 --> 04:15.747
Crazy sex?
Yeah. Yeah.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.309
Who are you having
crazy sex with?

04:17.320 --> 04:19.209
Ho ho ho!
Do as I say, not as I do.

04:19.220 --> 04:20.483
Seriously, I've
known you 3 years.

04:20.490 --> 04:22.754
Unless you're keeping
them all a secret--

04:22.760 --> 04:23.909
[cell phone rings]

04:23.930 --> 04:26.024
How does your phone
know how to do that?

04:26.030 --> 04:27.429
It's freaky.

04:27.430 --> 04:29.398
Ha ha! Hello.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.266
Yeah. Tell him
I'll call him back.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.295
Thanks. I'm out.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.940
It's on the house.
Call me later.

04:35.940 --> 04:37.863
I'm here all night.

04:37.870 --> 04:40.840
Remember, have fun.

04:48.920 --> 04:52.709
[mouths]
have fun.

05:03.460 --> 05:07.021
Amanda: Hmm.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.166
Can my friend pick me up? Huh?

05:08.170 --> 05:10.298
Can my friend pick me up? Yeah.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.938
Love you.
All right.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.339
Bye.

05:14.340 --> 05:16.434
Bye-bye.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.782
[ding]

05:38.700 --> 05:40.520
Ben: Call turner
at [LA.X. And confirm

05:40.540 --> 05:42.463
They closed the file on
the September threat.

05:42.470 --> 05:44.029
Let's put it to bed.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.405
Morning.
Coffee?

05:45.410 --> 05:47.970
Hey, jack.
I'm good.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.300
How about you, um--

05:49.310 --> 05:50.937
Belle.
No, thank you.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.770
I'm good.
You sure?

05:52.780 --> 05:54.077
I'm good.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.479
Weiss called to follow up
on the lopez case.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.869
Erotomania, guy who was
obsessed with the soap star--

05:57.890 --> 06:00.450
Jack: Morning.
I brought coffee.

06:00.460 --> 06:04.886
I went all ILA. With nonfat,
nondairy quad shot lattes.

06:04.890 --> 06:06.153
Did I get close?

06:06.160 --> 06:07.855
Oh, well,
thank you.

06:07.860 --> 06:10.056
Jack, don't
buy me coffee.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.629
Seriously? You're gonna
get mad at coffee?

06:11.630 --> 06:13.667
I'm just trying to make
a good impression,

06:13.670 --> 06:14.592
My ongoing struggle.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.795
You want to make
a good impression?

06:15.800 --> 06:18.167
Don't barge into my
office and interrupt me.

06:18.170 --> 06:23.438
Wow! You're tough. OK.
I'll just be at my desk.

06:24.080 --> 06:27.243
Do I even have a desk?

06:27.250 --> 06:30.550
Here. I'll show you.

06:32.490 --> 06:33.639
We're a small setup.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.287
We have 6 detectives
in the unit

06:35.290 --> 06:36.280
And an assistant--
belle.

06:36.290 --> 06:38.122
What about all the
other people? Various.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.326
There's vice, domestic
violence, mental health.

06:40.330 --> 06:42.628
People get moved around
a lot, and space is tight.

06:42.630 --> 06:45.190
6 detectives handle
all the stalker cases in |.A.?

06:45.200 --> 06:46.520
And any other threat
that occurs.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.826
So a lot of what
we do is consult

06:47.840 --> 06:48.864
And assist
other departments.

06:48.870 --> 06:50.133
Ben: So playing nice
is essential.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.837
Beth wants you up to speed.
Here are the active files.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.569
We handle around
300 cases a year

06:54.580 --> 06:56.400
With 20 to 30
ongoing.

06:56.410 --> 06:58.105
Happy reading.

06:58.110 --> 06:58.975
What's his rank?

06:58.980 --> 07:00.948
He's young, d1i,
a bit disgruntled.

07:00.950 --> 07:02.679
He doesn't seem
disgruntled.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.615
He's faking, lots of
repressed hostility.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.110
Beth keeps him trapped
behind the computer.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.418
Great cyber tech, but
he wants to be in the field,

07:09.430 --> 07:10.750
Which is why
he resents you.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.558
He doesn't appear
to resent me.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.892
If you're wondering,
I'm d2 with a background

07:14.900 --> 07:17.653
In sociology
and clinical psychology.

07:17.670 --> 07:18.762
We all have our own
skill set.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.659
So what's
my skill set?

07:20.670 --> 07:21.990
You come from
new york homicide.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.536
You tell me.
So why ILA.?

07:23.540 --> 07:26.168
Looking for a change.
What about you?

07:26.180 --> 07:27.204
How long
you been here?

07:27.210 --> 07:28.769
I'm an orange county native.
Single or married?

07:28.780 --> 07:31.909
Something tells me you know
the answers to all these questions.

07:31.910 --> 07:35.744
Just small talk.
Never mind.

07:35.750 --> 07:37.013
And chai tea.

07:37.020 --> 07:39.910
I usually drink chai tea
in the morning, but thanks.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.979
The gesture
worked for me.

07:41.990 --> 07:43.310
Janice, you free?

07:43.330 --> 07:44.479
Responding officers
called about

07:44.490 --> 07:45.628
A home invasion
in larchmont.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.985
They want us to assess.
Jack, let's go.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.822
You're tailing.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.492
I'm ron.
I live next door.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.501
I was out walking
cheeky here when, bam,

07:59.510 --> 08:00.705
Hannah ran
right into me,

08:00.710 --> 08:02.804
Probably scared me more
than I scared her.

08:02.810 --> 08:04.869
Janice: And none of you
saw or heard anything

08:04.880 --> 08:06.041
Out of the ordinary
last night?

08:06.050 --> 08:07.848
Woman: Just hannah screaming.
I live across the street.

08:07.850 --> 08:10.273
I was watching letterman,
and I called the police.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.782
Different woman: I live
right around the corner,

08:12.790 --> 08:16.055
Out like a light.
Sorry.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.779
Hannah: And then we ran
out of the house and into ron.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.485
He called 911,
and that was it.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.899
Ron is your
neighbor?

08:21.900 --> 08:24.870
Yeah. He was out
walking his dog.

08:24.870 --> 08:26.122
By the time
the cops came,

08:26.130 --> 08:27.359
Whoever it was
was gone.

08:27.370 --> 08:29.236
Is anything missing
in the house?

08:29.240 --> 08:31.038
No, not that my mom
and I could tell.

08:31.040 --> 08:35.409
In your statement, it says you
believe someone is following you.

08:35.409 --> 08:39.539
Every once in a while, I feel
like someone is watching me.

08:39.549 --> 08:41.871
I'll turn around, but
then no one is there,

08:41.880 --> 08:44.315
And it's really
freaky, you know?

08:44.320 --> 08:45.515
Mm-hmm.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.285
I can feel it,
and then somebody

08:48.290 --> 08:50.759
The last couple of weeks
has been in the back yard.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.252
They've been wearing
a hoodie or something.

08:53.260 --> 08:54.955
Hannah, why didn't
you tell your mom?

08:54.960 --> 08:57.429
She works a lot, and I
didn't want to worry her.

08:57.430 --> 09:00.195
Besides, who's
gonna believe me?

09:00.200 --> 09:02.862
I mean, it's not like I
have proof or anything.

09:02.870 --> 09:05.407
I believe you, hannah.
All right.

09:05.410 --> 09:07.139
Here's what I want
you to do.

09:07.140 --> 09:09.677
I want you to write down
every time you remember

09:09.680 --> 09:11.546
Someone watching you--
what day it was,

09:11.550 --> 09:13.302
What time it was,
anything that can help us

09:13.320 --> 09:15.277
Identify your
stalker's patterns.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.918
But I've never even
seen his face.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.888
I know, but your instincts
become my clues.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.415
A timeline will
really help us.

09:20.420 --> 09:23.720
Stalking usually begins
with a benign crush

09:23.730 --> 09:25.255
Or a fixation,
and it escalates

09:25.260 --> 09:27.251
Into something that
becomes more frequent.

09:27.260 --> 09:30.628
As the obsession grows,
so does the stalker's courage

09:30.630 --> 09:34.396
And his need
to reach out.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.665
Hannah, don't worry,
all right?

09:37.670 --> 09:40.207
We're gonna find out
who's doing this.

09:40.210 --> 09:42.099
<i>Woman: It's just
the two kids.</i>

09:42.110 --> 09:44.329

and thomas is 7.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.476
Hey, buddy.

09:45.480 --> 09:46.550
You like
my shirt?

09:46.550 --> 09:48.348
That's cool.
What is that?

09:48.350 --> 09:50.216
It's a platypus.

hannah when she was 10.

there anymore.

your husband pass?

10:31.230 --> 10:33.426

10:33.430 --> 10:37.298
It's been tough.

any fingerprints.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.034
Nothing seems to be missing.
What about you?

11:17.040 --> 11:18.360
There's a boot print
in the flower bed.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.872
More voyeur evidence
in the tree house.

11:22.880 --> 11:23.676
What do you think?

11:23.680 --> 11:25.444
He's following her,
spying on her.

11:25.450 --> 11:27.043
It's predatory,
sexual.

11:27.050 --> 11:28.609
Stalking
is just foreplay.

11:28.620 --> 11:31.715
The real goal
is sexual assault.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.381
Ben got a hit of
the sex offender database:

11:33.390 --> 11:36.155
Thaddeus barnes-- convicted
of raping a 12-year-old girl,

11:36.160 --> 11:40.324
Got out 6 months ago,
lives 4 blocks away.

11:46.970 --> 11:50.292
Beth: Mr. Barnes, where
were you last night?

11:50.310 --> 11:53.359
Took a walk around town
and then to bed.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.267
What's this about?

11:54.280 --> 11:55.839
We're investigating
a break-in.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.774
A teenage girl
was victimized.

11:57.780 --> 11:58.770
Oh, I see.

11:58.780 --> 12:00.669
Some little girl complains
about the bogeyman,

12:00.680 --> 12:03.012
So it's got to be me,
right?

12:03.020 --> 12:05.409
We'd like to come in,
take a look around.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.115
Do you have
a warrant?

12:07.120 --> 12:08.758
No. I have your
probation officer.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.411
I'll let him explain
the law to you.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.922
Excuse me.

12:54.370 --> 12:56.793
[music playing]

13:19.630 --> 13:22.497
That's hannah mccoy.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.666
They're
just pictures.

13:32.670 --> 13:34.832
Fetishizing
young girls.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.569
It's not illegal

13:36.580 --> 13:38.776
Or a violation
of my probation.

13:38.780 --> 13:43.047
I stay 100 yards away
from schools, parks, libraries.

13:43.050 --> 13:46.418
I don't talk to anyone
under 18 ever.

13:46.420 --> 13:50.482
What do you know
about her?

13:50.490 --> 13:54.484
Nothing.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.496
Seen her around.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.127
You in her
neighborhood a lot?

13:58.130 --> 13:59.689
It's a free country.
I like to walk.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.829
Apparently past the houses
of underage girls like hannah.

14:02.840 --> 14:06.470
Sweet and young, cute--
that's your type, right?

14:06.470 --> 14:08.165
I'm better now.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.104
There is no cure for a child
predator. We both know that.

14:11.110 --> 14:13.204
But there is
treatment--

14:13.220 --> 14:14.802
Cognitive, behavioral.

14:14.820 --> 14:17.175
I've developed
coping skills

14:17.190 --> 14:20.717
To change and curb
my impulses.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.711
I look.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.984
I don't touch.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.527
What's your
shoe size?

14:27.530 --> 14:28.793
10 1/2. Why?

14:28.800 --> 14:30.359
We found a boot print
under hannah's window.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.089
Right now, sid techs are going through
your closets trying to find a match.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.659
You'd save us
a lot of time--

14:34.670 --> 14:36.468
You can't
railroad me. Look.

14:36.470 --> 14:39.531
I know I have a problem,
and I am handling it

14:39.540 --> 14:43.306
The best way
I know how.

14:43.310 --> 14:50.671
Any further questions will be
answered in the presence of my lawyer.

14:51.150 --> 14:53.847
Hey, thanks for
coming so quickly.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.510
Yeah. I got your message,
and I got the warrant

14:55.520 --> 14:57.818
Granting you access
to barnes' hard drive.

14:57.830 --> 15:00.151
Great.
Oh, sorry.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.254
This is jack larson.
He's new to the team.

15:02.260 --> 15:04.354
Deputy d.A.
Amanda taylor.

15:04.370 --> 15:08.125
I'll call barnes' p.O., get him
to sign off on a probation hold.

15:08.140 --> 15:12.361
Good. That'll give you 24
hours to find something solid.

15:12.370 --> 15:15.101
Great.

15:15.110 --> 15:16.305
This is awkward.

15:16.310 --> 15:20.543
I didn't realize you
worked tau cases.

15:20.550 --> 15:21.870
Amanda...

15:21.880 --> 15:22.779
Amanda.

15:22.780 --> 15:24.145
Amanda,
hold on a second.

15:24.150 --> 15:27.120
You are something else.
You know that?

15:27.120 --> 15:28.485
Listen. The whole reason
I lobbied for tau

15:28.490 --> 15:30.049
Was because I thought you
worked robbery homicide.

15:30.060 --> 15:32.085
That's where you're
listed in the d.A.'s office.

15:32.090 --> 15:35.321
A beatrice somebody
handles tau.

15:35.330 --> 15:38.254
She's on maternity leave.
I'm covering for her.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.068
Look. I don't want
this to be weird.

15:40.070 --> 15:43.995
It's not weird.
It's despicable.

15:44.870 --> 15:48.807
Let's just talk for a
sec, work this out.

15:48.810 --> 15:51.734
Do you mind?

15:51.750 --> 15:54.344
[click]

15:55.020 --> 15:57.580
[click]

16:00.550 --> 16:03.588
I just spent the last 3 hours
at hannah's high school.

16:03.590 --> 16:06.184
I was expecting
this whole flashback scenario.

16:06.190 --> 16:08.727
Nothing. I don't recognize
high school anymore.

16:08.730 --> 16:11.358
Ben: Did hannah have any
conflicts with other students?

16:11.370 --> 16:13.464
Counselors, friends all
say hannah is a good girl--

16:13.470 --> 16:16.838
No trouble, smart,
high gpa, doesn't date.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.605
There are no boys in
the picture, which is weird.

16:19.610 --> 16:21.465
Because she's
a little hottie tottie

16:21.480 --> 16:24.177
And little hottie totties
always have a guy.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.136
What is that?

16:25.150 --> 16:27.403
The evidence
from barnes' laptop.

16:27.420 --> 16:31.846
Man, this guy
took a lot of photos.

16:33.650 --> 16:36.756
Belle: Lapd
threat assessment unit.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.183
One moment.

16:40.260 --> 16:41.421
Can I help you?

16:41.430 --> 16:44.695
I'd like to speak to
lieutenant beth davis.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.759
Your name?

16:46.770 --> 16:48.864
Beth: Perry.

16:50.140 --> 16:54.202
Am I interrupting?

16:56.840 --> 16:58.137
Ben:
This is so wrong.

16:58.150 --> 16:59.777
How does this not
violate his probation?

16:59.780 --> 17:01.669
It's not defined
in his paperwork.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.909
I mean, technically,
he can take

17:02.920 --> 17:06.550
All the personal photos
he wants in a public setting.

17:06.550 --> 17:09.087
Are we sure barnes
is our guy?

17:09.089 --> 17:11.512
According to his
original arrest report,

17:11.530 --> 17:12.986
Barnes was
a kindly neighbor.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.719
He let the local girls
play in his yard,

17:14.730 --> 17:18.826
Until one day, he drugged a
girl's lemonade and raped her.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.468
So he doesn't
like confrontation.

17:20.470 --> 17:22.438
So why break
into a house?

17:22.440 --> 17:25.034
I mean, it seems
too brazen.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.109
Pedophiles
are like addicts.

17:26.109 --> 17:28.363
Rarely do they
change their m.O.S.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.370
That was forensics.

17:29.380 --> 17:30.632
None of barnes' shoes
were a match

17:30.650 --> 17:32.470
For the boot print in
the mccoys' flower bed.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.006
I'm telling you, I mean,
this barnes is a bad dude,

17:35.020 --> 17:38.479
But is he the guy
we're looking for?

17:38.490 --> 17:40.913
Hannah said someone
was following,

17:40.920 --> 17:43.514
Someone in a hoodie,
size 10 1/2 boot,

17:43.530 --> 17:47.228
He sat in the tree house
watching.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.995
Do we have pictures of the house
from the tree's point of view?

17:57.010 --> 17:59.661
Ben: The tree's point of
view? Is the tree a suspect?

17:59.670 --> 18:03.334
Is this the hostility
you were talking about?

18:03.680 --> 18:05.808
Beth: What are you
doing here, perry?

18:05.810 --> 18:08.074
I didn't come here
to rat you out or anything

18:08.080 --> 18:09.445
If that's what you're
worried about.

18:09.450 --> 18:11.817
I'm not worried.
Really?

18:11.820 --> 18:14.915
Because you assaulted me
in a parking lot.

18:14.920 --> 18:18.379
I have no
recollection of that.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.654
What do you want?

18:20.660 --> 18:23.493
Sorry. I didn't come here
to be contentious.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.491
I wanted to tell you

18:25.500 --> 18:28.299
That it was wrong of me
to harass eric.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.496
I won't be contacting
him anymore.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.103
I heard you
loud and clear.

18:32.110 --> 18:35.978
Good.
I'll hold you to it.

18:36.380 --> 18:38.235
If that's all...

18:38.250 --> 18:40.901
Help me.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.844
I mean, I--

18:43.850 --> 18:48.412
I need help.
I know it.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.390
You know it?

18:51.390 --> 18:52.824
[door closes]

18:52.830 --> 18:55.390
How?

18:55.400 --> 18:57.129
I fixate.

18:57.130 --> 18:59.462
I can't explain it,
but there this part of me

18:59.470 --> 19:04.533
In my head that causes me
to focus on someone,

19:04.540 --> 19:06.736
And then it takes over.

19:06.740 --> 19:09.835
I want to know them.
I want to be with them.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.605
It's like a drug,

19:12.610 --> 19:16.877
And then the obsession
fuels me.

19:16.890 --> 19:19.018
It makes me matter.

19:19.020 --> 19:23.457
There's something
wrong with me.

19:25.930 --> 19:28.649
If you want help,
perry,

19:28.660 --> 19:32.267
Call this man.

19:32.530 --> 19:34.464
He's a therapist.

19:34.470 --> 19:39.169
He can help you
if you're serious.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.680
Thank you.

19:50.180 --> 19:52.615
[door opens]

19:55.790 --> 19:59.090
Janice: No direct povs.

20:00.230 --> 20:02.927
I went up the tree,

20:02.930 --> 20:06.924
And I can see directly
into the living room.

20:06.940 --> 20:08.897
There's a view
of the couch and the tv.

20:08.900 --> 20:11.267
Hannah is on the phone,
watching "survivor."

20:11.270 --> 20:13.034
"Oh, look who got voted
off the island.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.975
I always hated that creep.
I'm starving."

20:15.980 --> 20:17.573
I see the kitchen,
the fridge.

20:17.580 --> 20:19.105
She goes
for some string cheese.

20:19.110 --> 20:20.202
Ben: Dude,
what are you doing?

20:20.220 --> 20:22.279
He's role playing.
What's going on?

20:22.280 --> 20:23.509
He likes
to role play.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.715
Jack: I follow you around.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.245
I sit and watch you
watch tv,

20:26.250 --> 20:30.118
But how does that trigger me
to break into your house?

20:30.120 --> 20:32.487
She goes to
her bedroom.

20:32.490 --> 20:33.980
You watch her undress,
go to bed, sleep.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.721
Ben: But hannah's bedroom is
on the other side of the house.

20:37.730 --> 20:42.270
Jack: Right.
Wait, wait, wait.

20:42.270 --> 20:44.364
There's a window
on the right side of the house.

20:44.370 --> 20:47.135
Who's room is that?
Thomas' bedroom.

20:47.140 --> 20:49.177
What if hannah
isn't the target?

20:49.180 --> 20:52.070
Hannah made a journal of
every time she felt followed.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.902
Where is it?

20:55.780 --> 20:57.145
Uh...

20:57.150 --> 21:00.085
Daycare, store,
playground.

21:00.090 --> 21:01.444
Thomas was with her
every time.

21:01.460 --> 21:05.784
We have the wrong
victim. It's thomas.

21:07.590 --> 21:10.799
[telephone rings]

21:10.800 --> 21:13.622
[ring]

21:13.640 --> 21:16.792
Beth: Hello, mrs. Mccoy.
This is lieutenant davis.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.790
Yes,
lieutenant davis?

21:17.810 --> 21:19.801
Is thomas ok?
Yeah. He's fine.

21:19.810 --> 21:22.063
He's watching
a movie downstairs.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.229
Ok. I don't mean
to scare you,

21:23.240 --> 21:25.004
But I need you to check
on him right now.

21:25.010 --> 21:28.708
We think the person who broke in
might have been there for thomas.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.449
Mom...

21:30.450 --> 21:32.544
Thomas?

21:32.550 --> 21:36.418
Thomas? Thomas?

21:37.820 --> 21:41.779
Thomas, baby,
where are you?

21:41.800 --> 21:44.360
Thomas?

21:44.370 --> 21:46.896
Oh, my god.
Baby?

21:46.900 --> 21:49.597
Thomas?

21:49.600 --> 21:53.059
Thomas? Thomas?

21:53.070 --> 21:57.177
Thomas--he's gone.
He's not here.

21:57.180 --> 22:02.778
Thomas? Thomas?

22:09.390 --> 22:12.826
Run any prints you find
immediately.

22:12.830 --> 22:15.424
Mrs. Mccoy: He's only 7.

22:15.430 --> 22:17.922
He's never spent
the night away from me.

22:17.930 --> 22:20.126
We're gonna find him,
I promise.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.564
How do you
know that?

22:21.570 --> 22:24.130
Don't say that.
Don't do that.

22:24.140 --> 22:26.404
Don't say things
you don't know.

22:26.410 --> 22:28.299
She said it because
she does know it.

22:28.310 --> 22:32.201
We're gonna bring thomas home
safe and sound.

22:55.540 --> 22:58.293
Mrs. Mccoy:
What's that?

22:58.310 --> 23:00.631
Thomas' squirt gun.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.062
No. That's not his.

23:02.080 --> 23:05.334
I don't allow guns
of any kind in this house.

23:05.350 --> 23:08.069
Have you seen
this before?

23:08.080 --> 23:11.243
No.

23:26.830 --> 23:29.026
What are you doing?

23:29.040 --> 23:31.793
We talked to your
guidance counselor.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.505
You're a good girl,
hannah--

23:33.510 --> 23:36.377
Smart, lots of friends,
no boyfriend, though,

23:36.380 --> 23:38.701
Which I find odd since
you're so pretty and sexy

23:38.710 --> 23:41.179
With your little crop tops
and your tattoo.

23:41.180 --> 23:44.013
No judgment, mind you.
I think you're good.

23:44.020 --> 23:46.512
I just don't think
you're innocent.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.147
You're
a responsible girl.

23:48.160 --> 23:52.825
I'm guessing that we're
gonna find within arm's reach.

23:52.830 --> 23:54.423
Oh.

23:54.430 --> 23:56.421
What's this?

23:56.430 --> 23:59.058
That is none
of your business.

23:59.070 --> 24:02.165
[zip]

24:03.270 --> 24:05.489
Again, no judgment.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.467
Who are you having
sex with, hannah?

24:07.480 --> 24:11.007
What's his name
or shoe size, huh?

24:11.010 --> 24:13.445
This has nothing
to do with thomas.

24:13.450 --> 24:16.169
Right now, everything
has to do with thomas.

24:16.180 --> 24:20.515
I need a name,
hannah, now.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.085
Beth:
You're victor sweeney?

24:26.090 --> 24:28.559
You work in a tattoo parlor
on lankershim?

24:28.560 --> 24:29.994
Yeah.
What's this about?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.422
Jack: Hannah mccoy.

24:31.430 --> 24:33.023
You did
her tattoo, right,

24:33.030 --> 24:35.328
Been over her house
a couple times?

24:35.340 --> 24:37.490
Not that I remember.

24:37.510 --> 24:41.265
You recognize
this toy gun?

24:41.280 --> 24:45.376
Beth: No? Your boots have
a very specific tread.

24:45.380 --> 24:46.677
A lot like this
print that we found

24:46.680 --> 24:49.513
Under hannah's
bedroom window.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.340
Ok. So I was there.
So what?

24:51.350 --> 24:52.840
So you're in a
relationship with hannah,

24:52.850 --> 24:54.682
And her brother was
abducted this afternoon.

24:54.690 --> 24:57.557
Jack: Can you account for
your whereabouts today, victor?

24:57.560 --> 25:00.257
I was at home asleep.
Wait.

25:00.260 --> 25:01.955
You don't think I had
something to do with this.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.190
You kept your relationship
with hannah a secret.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.292
Maybe thomas
found out.

25:05.300 --> 25:06.790
Maybe you wanted
to shut him up.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.770
You have a rap sheet,
victor, mostly petty crimes--

25:09.770 --> 25:11.260
Vandalism,
drunk and disorderly.

25:11.270 --> 25:14.137
A 28-year-old guy
with a 16-year-old girl?

25:14.140 --> 25:15.699
That's statutory rape.

25:15.710 --> 25:18.202
It wasn't like that,
I swear.

25:18.210 --> 25:21.874
I gave thomas the
squirt gun as a present.

25:21.880 --> 25:25.009
He was a nice kid.
I would never hurt him,

25:25.020 --> 25:28.149
Never.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.412
Hannah mentioned
a stalker.

25:29.420 --> 25:31.218
You were creeping
around that house at night.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.221
You must have
seen something.

25:33.230 --> 25:34.789
Once a couple
weeks ago--

25:34.800 --> 25:38.919
It was pretty late--
and then again last week.

25:38.930 --> 25:40.125
I was leaving her house,

25:40.130 --> 25:41.689
And there was a car
parked down the street,

25:41.700 --> 25:43.395
And I could see someone
in the driver's seat,

25:43.400 --> 25:45.698
And they were just
staring at hannah's house.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.860
So I figured
it had to be the guy.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.202
No. He was wearing a hoodie,
and when I came at him,

25:51.210 --> 25:52.075
He screeched off.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.605
Jack: What kind
of car? What color?

25:53.610 --> 25:54.771
I don't know, man.
Think!

25:54.780 --> 25:56.976
Jack: What kind of car?
What color? Come on.

25:56.980 --> 25:59.176
It was silver or gray,
maybe a sedan.

25:59.190 --> 26:02.080
Beth: And you withheld
this information why?

26:02.090 --> 26:04.013
You know why.
Come on.

26:04.030 --> 26:07.056
I'm being straight
with you guys.

26:07.060 --> 26:09.392
Ben: Tattoo guy said he
saw a silver or gray sedan

26:09.400 --> 26:12.893
I searched through the
pedophile's pictures and found this.

26:12.900 --> 26:14.299
Janice: I checked dmv,
and it belongs

26:14.300 --> 26:17.531
To rosemary wilson, the mccoys'
neighbor. I interviewed her.

26:17.540 --> 26:19.634
Find her now.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.007
[picks up phone]

26:40.790 --> 26:43.521
We're here, james.

26:45.130 --> 26:47.667
We're home.

26:48.030 --> 26:49.839
I want my mommy.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.899
Aw, honey,
mommy is right here.

26:51.910 --> 26:55.369
Oh, you look so sleepy.
Did you have a nice nap?

26:55.380 --> 26:57.405
You shouldn't have drank
all that cough syrup.

26:57.410 --> 27:00.744
You know it's not
like candy, sweetie.

27:00.750 --> 27:03.640
I'll be right back.

27:03.650 --> 27:05.618
Don't you
go anywhere.,

27:05.620 --> 27:07.247
No! Please! No!

27:07.250 --> 27:09.457
[screaming,
pounding on trunk]

27:09.460 --> 27:11.883
No!

27:16.760 --> 27:18.899
[keys clatter]

27:28.270 --> 27:30.830
Who are you...

27:30.850 --> 27:34.400
And what the hell are
you doing in my house?

27:34.420 --> 27:36.673
Who are you...

27:36.680 --> 27:39.479
And what are you
doing in my house?

27:39.490 --> 27:43.415
Look. If you
don't get out--

28:05.410 --> 28:07.674
They searched
rosemary's house.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.980
It's her.
They found this.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.981
The place looked like
she left in a hurry,

28:12.990 --> 28:14.947
Hasn't been seen
since yesterday.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.588
What about the apb
on her car, the amber alert?

28:17.590 --> 28:18.887
There has
to be something.

28:18.890 --> 28:19.652
I just checked.

28:19.660 --> 28:20.752
Thomas' photo
is everywhere.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.023
We've received over
two dozen calls.

28:22.030 --> 28:23.020
Nothing
is panning out.

28:23.030 --> 28:24.429
Janice: That was the real
rosemary wilson.

28:24.430 --> 28:26.865
Apparently, her sister judith
ann is who we're looking for.

28:26.870 --> 28:29.191
So rosemary has been using
her sister's identity?

28:29.200 --> 28:31.191
Do a search
on judith ann wilson.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.030
The real rosemary
lives in seattle.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.303
Seems judith
has problems.

28:34.310 --> 28:37.029
She's stolen her sister's
identity more than once,

28:37.040 --> 28:38.838
Thinks people
are out to get her.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.545
Sounds like paranoia.

28:40.550 --> 28:45.044
Apparently, judith hasn't been
the same since her son died.

28:45.050 --> 28:46.745
Ben: Judith ann wilson
gave birth to a son

28:46.750 --> 28:50.584
James peterson at good
samaritan hospital 9 years ago.

28:50.590 --> 28:51.819
According to his
death certificate,

28:51.830 --> 28:53.980
James peterson drowned two
years back, ruled accidental.

28:53.990 --> 28:56.129
So thomas would be the same
age her son was when he died.

28:56.130 --> 28:58.121
That could've
triggered her fixation.

28:58.130 --> 28:59.791
She's looking
for a replacement.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.427
Ok. So where
did she take thomas?

29:01.440 --> 29:04.660
Derek peterson, accountant,
lives in the south bay.

29:04.670 --> 29:06.764
You think she's trying to
put her family back together?

29:06.770 --> 29:09.899
Or he might know
where she took him.

29:09.910 --> 29:13.073
I wish I could help, but I haven't
seen judith since we divorced.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.309
Which is right after
your son died.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.914
Yes, but things weren't
good between us before that.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.446
She was--
impulsive?

29:19.450 --> 29:23.182
One minute, she hated me.
The next was total love.

29:23.190 --> 29:27.525
Mr. Peterson, do you have any
idea where she might have gone?

29:27.530 --> 29:29.089
I'm sorry. I don't.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.852
I understand your son
was 7 when he drowned.

29:30.870 --> 29:35.899
He and judith were in a
rowboat on echo park lake.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.061
James fell in.

29:37.070 --> 29:40.859
But you're not so sure
that's what happened.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.804
Of course I am. It
was a terrible accident.

29:43.810 --> 29:45.175
Jack: According to
her medical records,

29:45.180 --> 29:46.807
Judith was diagnosed
with antisocial

29:46.810 --> 29:48.209
Personality disorder
in her 20s.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.712
Yes, but she was very good at
keeping up on her medication.

29:50.720 --> 29:53.280
And you filed for divorce
6 weeks before james died?

29:53.290 --> 29:55.247
How did she
take the news?

29:55.260 --> 29:56.955
Not well.

29:56.960 --> 30:00.021
She lashed out,
became depressed.

30:00.030 --> 30:02.124
It's possible
she blamed james

30:02.130 --> 30:03.825
For the demise of
your relationship.

30:03.830 --> 30:06.162
If you're suggesting that
judith had anything to do with--

30:06.170 --> 30:07.729
Jack:
You're in denial, derek.

30:07.740 --> 30:09.299
You don't want to think
she could hurt your son

30:09.300 --> 30:11.860
Because that would mean you
weren't there for him as a father.

30:11.870 --> 30:13.759
But you know
the truth,

30:13.770 --> 30:15.966
Don't you,
mr. Peterson?

30:15.980 --> 30:20.076
I thought, but there
was never any proof.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.139
Who would do
something like that?

30:22.150 --> 30:24.414
Maybe she was desperate
to save her marriage,

30:24.420 --> 30:27.344
And when that didn't work out,
all she had left was guilt.

30:27.350 --> 30:29.409
Seeing thomas brought
back the ghost of james.

30:29.420 --> 30:31.184
It eased the pain,
a psychotic delusion

30:31.190 --> 30:32.954
Brought on by
a repressed memory.

30:32.960 --> 30:36.260
Which fueled
her obsession.

30:36.260 --> 30:37.455
Mr. Peterson,

30:37.460 --> 30:39.497
Where were you and judith
living at the time?

30:39.500 --> 30:41.992
A couple blocks
from where he drowned.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.695
Address?

30:43.700 --> 30:47.807
1217 terrace drive.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.800
[muffled shouting]

30:51.810 --> 30:53.608
[pounding]

30:53.610 --> 30:57.717
Woman: Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!

30:57.720 --> 31:01.145

31:04.960 --> 31:07.054
[whimpers]

31:07.060 --> 31:08.983

31:09.000 --> 31:11.890
Shut up!

31:11.900 --> 31:13.595
[whimpering]

31:13.600 --> 31:15.898
Oh, quiet, james.

31:15.900 --> 31:20.030
You know how much mommy
hates it when you cry.

31:20.040 --> 31:23.237
[muffled scream]

31:31.550 --> 31:33.484
[tires screech]

31:50.240 --> 31:51.935
Judith: Shut up.

31:51.940 --> 31:54.705
I said shut up!
Look at me.

31:54.710 --> 31:56.371
She's in there.
So is thomas.

31:56.380 --> 31:59.270
You take the front.
I'll take the back.

31:59.280 --> 32:02.944
Beth: I have an idea.

32:18.830 --> 32:20.696
Hello? Hi.

32:20.700 --> 32:24.796
Sorry to barge in.
The door was open.

32:28.810 --> 32:33.350
I'm your neighbor beth
from down the street.

32:43.290 --> 32:46.749
H-hoping I could borrow
a cup of sugar.

32:46.760 --> 32:51.357
I'm attempting to bake,
and I ran out.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.428
This your son?

32:55.440 --> 32:58.364
<i>James.
He's such a cutie.</i>

32:58.370 --> 33:00.759
Looks just like you.

33:02.440 --> 33:06.707
Thank you.

33:08.310 --> 33:12.178
It's judith, right?

33:12.190 --> 33:15.148
Is it? Yes.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.356
Yes. It is,

33:17.360 --> 33:20.421
But you can
call me judy.

33:20.430 --> 33:23.559
All my friends do.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.528
Which house did you
say you lived in?

33:29.540 --> 33:34.467
Just across,
two doors down.

33:36.710 --> 33:40.408
Is it sugar that
you said you wanted?

33:40.410 --> 33:43.209
Yeah, just a cup.

33:43.220 --> 33:46.747
The recipe
requires two.

33:48.890 --> 33:51.757
Thomas, run.
No!

33:51.760 --> 33:58.257
James, baby! James!

34:33.929 --> 34:37.230
Thomas, unlock the door.

34:37.239 --> 34:38.833
I don't know you.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.239
Yeah, you do.
We met at your house.

34:40.239 --> 34:42.436
I'm gonna take you
to your mom's.

34:42.440 --> 34:46.172
Open the door, buddy.

34:52.550 --> 34:56.043
You ruined
my life, james.

It's ok.

35:01.230 --> 35:05.656
It's all right.
Everything is ok, jack.

35:07.770 --> 35:12.867
Judy, it's me,
your friend.

35:12.870 --> 35:16.738
You don't want to hurt james.
You love him, remember?

35:16.740 --> 35:21.246
Judith, don't do this.
This is thomas mccoy.

35:21.250 --> 35:24.777
It's not james.
Thomas is not james.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.849
Oh...

35:26.850 --> 35:28.545
James is gone.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.585

No.

Yes. Yes.

You can trust me.

I'm gonna get you the
help you need, all right?

35:51.710 --> 35:53.576

hurting.

I don't care if you
don't like me.

37:29.140 --> 37:30.539
I like you.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.180
You are one
awkward dude.

37:33.180 --> 37:35.569
Hmm.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.746
Hey.
Hey.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.717
Want to grab a drink
and bond some?

37:44.730 --> 37:47.381
Strictly platonic,
for the most part.

37:47.390 --> 37:50.519
Is it ever platonic?

37:53.100 --> 37:55.990
If I go to drinks with you and
get even the slightest bit buzzed,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.970
I'm gonna turn into that guy
because you are a really hot woman.

37:58.970 --> 38:01.359
So please don't
take this the wrong way.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.200
I've been that guy.

38:03.210 --> 38:06.430
I don't want to be that guy,
not here at work with you.

38:06.450 --> 38:09.408
I'd like to keep
things clean.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.912
You mind if we don't?

38:11.920 --> 38:15.242
It was just
drinks, jack.

38:15.260 --> 38:20.380
It's never just
drinks, janice.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.790
Wow, did he
just reject you?

38:30.800 --> 38:32.495
That's got to hurt.

38:32.510 --> 38:33.568
On the contrary.

38:33.570 --> 38:38.804
He just got
more interesting.

38:55.660 --> 38:58.925
We never got a chance to
finish our conversation.

38:58.930 --> 39:02.423
So let's finish it. Go.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.363
I know I hurt you.

39:04.370 --> 39:05.838
I know you'll
never forgive me.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.366
I wouldn't even
ask you to,

39:08.380 --> 39:12.908
But I'm not here to ruin
your life, either.

39:12.910 --> 39:14.844
I just--

39:16.350 --> 39:18.546
I just want the chance
to know my son.

39:18.550 --> 39:21.520
I don't want you
to know him, jack.

39:21.520 --> 39:25.013
You're not worthy of him.
Do you understand that?

39:25.030 --> 39:26.828
I would never hurt him.

39:26.830 --> 39:28.753
Famous last words,
jack.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.229
Now it's my turn,
so listen up.

39:31.230 --> 39:33.619
You have two weeks
to get out of |.A.

39:33.630 --> 39:36.167
Put in for a transfer.
Quit. Go back to new york.

39:36.170 --> 39:38.696
I don't care,
but if you do not leave,

39:38.710 --> 39:40.804
I will go to beth
and your division captain

39:40.810 --> 39:42.300
And I will tell them
that little thing

39:42.310 --> 39:44.278
That I know
and nobody else does,

39:44.280 --> 39:46.305
And it will ruin you.

39:46.310 --> 39:48.540
Now, I know you care
about your career.

39:48.550 --> 39:50.678
In fact, it's the only
thing that you care about.

39:50.680 --> 39:57.689
So don't be stupid.
I repeat, two weeks.

39:58.260 --> 40:01.025
[music playing]

40:19.550 --> 40:21.348
[keys clatter]

40:21.350 --> 40:26.049
[beep beep]

41:12.700 --> 41:15.123
Perry: Can I get
a manhattan?

41:15.140 --> 41:19.839
You look pretty young.
Can I see some 1.D.?

41:19.840 --> 41:22.707
[laughs]

41:26.250 --> 41:30.414
You got something
against younger men? Yes...

41:32.620 --> 41:34.679
And no.

41:42.430 --> 41:44.421
One manhattan
coming up.
