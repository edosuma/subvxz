Come on. Outside. Get out.
Get out. Get out.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.672

08:18.715 --> 08:19.934
The air,
I can feel it right now.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.979
Yeah, we got
that fixed yesterday.

08:22.023 --> 08:25.983
- Okay, Gabs. Dr Catania.
- That's me.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.594
That's crazy, Gabrielle.
You did it.

08:27.637 --> 08:28.812
Your mother is a doctor.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.510
- Do you love working?
- Love it.

08:30.553 --> 08:33.513
Hey, guys. Oh, hey. Hey.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.166
Hi, Mom.
- Very nice pants.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.517
Thank you. It's work outfit.
Been going well.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.083
He's working for Luis.

08:39.127 --> 08:40.781
- What's he doing for Luis?
- Real estate.

08:40.824 --> 08:42.913
Luis is a hard worker.
He's got a good heart too.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.002
- He's a mentor to you, right?
- He's amazing.

08:45.046 --> 08:47.396
I'm happy Teresa's with him.
That's what she deserves.

08:47.439 --> 08:48.440
Well, good for her.

08:48.484 --> 08:49.703
- Yeah.
- All right.

08:49.746 --> 08:50.834
So when were you here last?
- I don't know.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.270
Probably a few weeks ago.
Let me see.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.011
Like, this doesn't
have to be like this.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.753
This is unfinished.
The molding's not done.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.842
These covers could
go on by now.

08:58.886 --> 09:01.366

and my microwave?

09:01.410 --> 09:02.672

09:02.716 --> 09:05.109

09:10.898 --> 09:13.030
<i>David offered</i> <i>
for me to stay with him,</i>

09:13.074 --> 09:15.250
but that, in my mind,
wasn't an option.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.295
I don't believe in living
with somebody

09:17.339 --> 09:19.036
unless you have a commitment.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.864
And my relationship with David
isn't really changing.

09:20.908 --> 09:23.388
<i>So I rented myself</i> <i>
a townhouse,</i>

09:23.432 --> 09:25.390
<i>and I like it a lot.</i>

09:25.434 --> 09:28.480
<i>But then Frankie graduated</i> <i>
from college and Gabrielle</i>

09:28.524 --> 09:30.265
graduated from vet school.
It was supposed to be

09:30.308 --> 09:31.745
very nice for you
when you came home.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.442
I just want door knobs.

09:33.485 --> 09:34.704
I have to go to the bathroom
with the door open

09:34.748 --> 09:36.053

don't stay closed.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.489
Yeah.

09:37.533 --> 09:40.710
I promised that they could
come live home for free,

09:40.754 --> 09:43.539

nice and easy.

things are supposed to be.

He's not coming back.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.815
He's very busy with company.
- Exactly.

09:58.859 --> 10:01.209
Frank's priorities are
a little off at this moment

16:20.240 --> 16:21.763
Hiding from the disease.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.156
How's everybody doing
this evening?

16:23.199 --> 16:24.374
Can I offer you a drink
from the bar?

16:24.418 --> 16:26.420
Can I do a Belvedere
and soda?

16:26.463 --> 16:28.030
Can I have
a Belvedere martini?

16:28.074 --> 16:29.640
I'ma do the same
but on the rocks.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.729
I'm gonna do
the strawberry martini.

16:31.773 --> 16:32.730
- Okay.
- I'm starving.

16:32.774 --> 16:33.775
Pick what you want
for apps.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.255
We can do meatballs.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.560
We met Tikki and Traci

16:36.604 --> 16:37.997
<i>eight years ago</i> <i>
through a mutual friend.</i>

16:38.040 --> 16:39.346
Do you want
littleneck clams?

16:39.389 --> 16:40.869
It's an aphrodisiac.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.740
We should do that, right?
All right.

16:42.784 --> 16:45.091
And of course, Joe, loving
sports, was super excited

16:45.134 --> 16:47.397
to meet Tikki who was
a legend in the New York

16:47.441 --> 16:50.966
<i>Giants running back world</i> <i>
and he's a sports commentator.</i>

16:51.010 --> 16:53.447
We're just like two peas
in a mother----ing pod.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.884
I'm just a little
better looking.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.581
And we just
loved each other.

16:57.625 --> 17:01.063
- See, this is why I miss Joe.
- You know I do stand-up now.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.499
We just did a show
in Atlantic City.

17:02.543 --> 17:03.805
I saw.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.112
Who's ready to meet
the househusbands?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.987
You ever seen a dog
just starts doing this?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.902
- What is wrong...
- I'm like, "Oh, my God."

17:13.945 --> 17:15.730
He's got these little paws.

17:15.773 --> 17:18.646
He can't even jerk off.
I'll help you.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.648
The man's been very busy.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.563
I believe it--aren't you guys
building a house?

17:22.606 --> 17:24.695
- Yes.
- We're in a rental right now.

17:24.739 --> 17:26.654
When's the new house
gonna be done?

17:26.697 --> 17:29.004
I cannot share a bathroom
with dirty boys anymore.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.875
We bought a property
in Franklin Lakes.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.748
The plans got done,
like, two days ago.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.141
I really wanted to get back
to Bergen County

17:35.184 --> 17:36.838
which is so funny.
Teresa and her boyfriend

17:36.881 --> 17:39.362
just bought a house
right next door to our house.

17:39.406 --> 17:40.842
We moved out
and they literally

17:40.885 --> 17:42.235
moved in the same week.
- Wow.

17:42.278 --> 17:44.846
Speaking of, Teresa wrote me
such a sweet text.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.891
She sent me the invite
for her party.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.589
- All right, so you're coming?
- Yeah.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.373
Is her boyfriend
gonna be there?

17:50.417 --> 17:53.376
- Yes. She's in love.
- And?

17:53.420 --> 17:55.248
Listen, she has been,
I think,

17:55.291 --> 17:58.164
looking for "Mr. Right"
for a very long time

17:58.207 --> 18:00.905
and he kind of was like
the knight in shining armor

18:00.949 --> 18:03.343
that, like, swooped in.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.606
<i>♪</i>

18:05.649 --> 18:06.650
What?

18:06.694 --> 18:08.043
I don't know.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.612
Speak, Joseph.
This is your sister.

18:11.655 --> 18:13.179
I mean, listen.

18:13.222 --> 18:16.747
<i>♪</i>

18:18.401 --> 18:19.663
<i>She's in love.</i>

18:19.707 --> 18:21.143
He kinda of was like

18:21.187 --> 18:23.145
the knight in shining armor

18:23.189 --> 18:26.017
that made her so happy.

18:26.061 --> 18:28.498
What?
- I don't know.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.675
Speak, Joseph.
This is your sister.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.983
I mean, listen, we saw
Joe Giudice make her happy too.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.158
Yeah.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.073
When I first met Luis,
he was cool.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.335
What's the deal
with Teresa, man?

18:39.379 --> 18:40.554
I hear she got a new boyfriend.

18:40.597 --> 18:42.425
- Do you like him?
- I love him.

18:42.469 --> 18:45.167
But now, you know, I-I hear
all this stuff about him.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.082
There is a lot of rumors
about him.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.215
There's also two sides
to every story.

18:49.258 --> 18:50.651
And I mean, there's definitely
been things about us

18:50.694 --> 18:52.609
that have come out
that are completely false.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.611
- Right. <i>
- Listen, I find it hard</i>

18:54.655 --> 18:56.918
to judge other people
based on rumors

18:56.961 --> 18:58.137
because of my own history.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.574
I've been married to Tiki
for nine years.

19:00.617 --> 19:03.142
<i>We have two children,</i> <i>
Brooklyn and Teagan,</i>

19:03.185 --> 19:05.231
and Tiki has four kids
from his first marriage.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.102
<i>He got separated</i> <i>
from his ex-wife</i>

19:07.146 --> 19:09.235
when she was about
eight weeks pregnant.

19:09.278 --> 19:10.845
<i>So when Tiki and I first met</i>

19:10.888 --> 19:12.412
<i>when I was working</i> <i>
at "The Today Show,"</i>

19:12.455 --> 19:14.718
Tiki was already separated
four or five months,

19:14.762 --> 19:17.373
<i>but it blew up into</i> <i>
a full-blown media circus</i>

19:17.417 --> 19:18.592
<i>with rumors swirling.</i>

19:18.635 --> 19:20.420
You can't believe
everything you read,

19:20.463 --> 19:23.205
but what's with the video?

19:23.249 --> 19:24.380
That's a different story.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.426
I just feel like it raises
a red flag.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.993
I-I think the whole setting
was very bizarre.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.561
It's a little odd.
He told me about that camp

19:31.605 --> 19:33.215
when I first met him,
he told me,

19:33.259 --> 19:35.261
listen, I want to take you
to this camp.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.480
<i>But when the video came out,</i> <i>
I watched it.</i>

19:37.524 --> 19:39.047
I'm like, you know,
I'm just not,

19:39.090 --> 19:40.701
you know, I'm really not into
that kind of camp.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.572
It's a retreat for men

19:42.616 --> 19:44.574
to come back from whatever
they're suffering from maybe.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.707
Oh, oh, I see. But something
was off in his life.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.709
Well, what does she say
about it? She's not worried?

19:48.752 --> 19:50.406
She's gonna say,
"He's amazing.

19:50.450 --> 19:53.235
You see the way he apologized?
What an amazing man."

19:53.279 --> 19:54.541
I don't know
what to say anymore

19:54.584 --> 19:56.673
because if I did say it,
I'm--I'm the bad guy.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.458
My brother-in-law
put her in prison.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.547
And I said something and I
was the bad guy. It was that--

20:00.590 --> 20:03.419
That has to weigh heavy
on you though, right?

20:03.463 --> 20:04.899
Like obviously
you can speak your mind

20:04.942 --> 20:06.248
and say how you feel to her?

20:06.292 --> 20:08.381
- Why does she not trust you?
- I don't know.

20:08.424 --> 20:09.947
I don't think it's trust.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.862
I think it's probably
she's really in love

20:11.906 --> 20:14.038
and she doesn't want
to hear anything negative.

20:14.082 --> 20:15.388
But she's not married.
She's not committed to this.

20:15.431 --> 20:16.519
She just--they're--

20:16.563 --> 20:17.651
They just bought
a home together.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.130
Well, no, they
bought a house together.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.175
- That's a big commitment.
- Hold on.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.524
Hold up, I stand corrected.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.047
But all you can do
is judge how he treats you.

20:23.091 --> 20:24.266
That's it.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.354
It could be a great thing
for her.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.138
I'ma drink to that.
Celebrate.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.836
You're my brother
from another mother.

20:28.879 --> 20:30.707
You know what I call that?
B fam.

20:37.323 --> 20:40.108
Big fork, small fork.

20:40.151 --> 20:41.457
All right, Olivia. Good job.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.416
Mom, are we gonna have salad
with dinner?

20:43.459 --> 20:45.983
Because I put a salad fork.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.550
- I can.
- Hi, Mom.

20:47.594 --> 20:48.812
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Baba.

20:48.856 --> 20:51.772
Put this on the table.
Daddy, come sit.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.469
Okay, who wants salad?

20:53.513 --> 20:55.863
Guys, we use our smaller
forks for the salad.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.299
So fancy.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.823
Mom, can you breathe
in the bandage?

20:59.867 --> 21:02.652
Oh, yeah, I can breathe.
Totally fine with it, babe.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.001
I gotta be honest with you.

21:04.045 --> 21:06.395
very unusual to cover it
for this long, but...

21:06.439 --> 21:08.658
He told me to do it
for as long as I can.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.834
Now this is week
three, four, five.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.619
It's kind of crazy.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.316
Why?
How do you guys do it here?

21:14.360 --> 21:15.839
You to take the splint off
and that's it.

21:15.883 --> 21:18.189
Here, people don't want anyone
to know they had surgery.

21:18.233 --> 21:21.410
<i>I've been wanting a nose job</i> <i>
for the longest time.</i>

21:21.454 --> 21:23.325
I mean, do you think
the nose looks good?

21:23.369 --> 21:25.371
Um... I don't know.

21:25.414 --> 21:26.763
I don't think it's worse.
I just haven't thought

21:26.807 --> 21:27.982
there was anything wrong
with your nose.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.331
Same.

21:29.375 --> 21:32.508
So I went to Turkey
to visit my brother

21:32.552 --> 21:34.031
<i>and finally meet my nephew.</i>

21:34.075 --> 21:35.424
<i>He had a christening.</i>

21:35.468 --> 21:36.991
<i>And while I was there,</i>

21:37.034 --> 21:39.036
<i>I got my nose</i> <i>
and my chin done.</i>

21:39.080 --> 21:40.429
They put tampons in my nose.

21:40.473 --> 21:44.520
Tampons? Girls--
is that when they get their--

21:44.564 --> 21:45.739
<i>I went to a doctor in Turkey</i>

21:45.782 --> 21:48.219
that I found on Instagram
over a year ago

21:48.263 --> 21:51.353
<i>because after having my tummy</i> <i>
tuck last year with Bill,</i>

21:51.397 --> 21:53.834
<i>he told me that I was</i> <i>
the worst patient in the world</i>

21:53.877 --> 21:56.358
and he was never doing surgery
on me ever again.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.838
It is nice to have you back.

21:57.881 --> 22:00.014
Yeah, I know that was
a long time for me to be gone.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.712
Daddy, you know I got there
the day before Mom got there

22:02.756 --> 22:04.671
and then--can you
put the phone down?

22:04.714 --> 22:05.889
We're having a conversation,
babe.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.500
Don't you wanna hear
what happened?

22:07.543 --> 22:09.023
Don't you guys--aren't
you guys curious

22:09.066 --> 22:10.677
about what happened with Nana
when I was there?

22:10.720 --> 22:11.547
Oh, yeah.

22:11.591 --> 22:12.896
For the past year,

22:12.940 --> 22:14.724
I've been in a bad place
with my mom.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.900
Me and my mom got into a fight
and like,

22:16.944 --> 22:19.816
I don't think we're just gonna
be talking for a while.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.384
Mike and Mom
came into the apartment

22:22.428 --> 22:23.733
and I just went to her.

22:23.777 --> 22:27.433
I gave her a big hug,
and she started crying.

22:27.476 --> 22:29.652
And I said, "Let's just
be done with it."

22:29.696 --> 22:31.654
- So you guys made up?
- So we made up.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.482
- Yay!
- We made up.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.919
So what's gonna happen
when your mom gets back here?

22:35.963 --> 22:37.878
I mean, listen,
she's not gonna change.

22:37.921 --> 22:41.316
Right. Some issues are best
not fully addressed.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.492
Anyway, you guys have
any homework?

22:43.536 --> 22:45.276
I have AP chemistry tomorrow.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.191
All right, babe.
So then go study.

22:47.235 --> 22:48.367
- Are we done?
- Take your plate.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.890
- Yeah.
- Take your plate by the sink.

22:49.933 --> 22:51.979
You gonna eat that bean salad
or should I chuck it?

22:52.022 --> 22:53.633
I ate half of it.
No one else is eating it.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.765
I'll eat it later maybe.

22:55.809 --> 22:58.377
It was so sweet
to see Olivia happy

22:58.420 --> 22:59.769
that you and your mom made up.

22:59.813 --> 23:02.381
Oh, my God, I know.
I wish it could be

23:02.424 --> 23:04.426
that easy to make amends
with these girls.

23:04.470 --> 23:05.645
You know, last time
we left off,

23:05.688 --> 23:07.473
I thought we were all good.

23:07.516 --> 23:08.996
- To new beginnings.
- New beginnings.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.084
- A fresh start.
- Cheers.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.433
And all of a sudden Melissa

23:11.477 --> 23:14.131
did that big social media rant.

23:14.175 --> 23:16.438
<i>That's ----ed up.</i> <i>
She's calling me fake, phony.</i>

23:16.482 --> 23:17.787
<i>It came out of nowhere.</i>

23:17.831 --> 23:20.442
<i>Margaret commented,</i> <i>
Jackie commented.</i>

23:20.486 --> 23:23.619
You know, and I fought back
with my own post.

23:23.663 --> 23:25.839
<i>Maybe calling</i> <i>
Joe Gorga a crook</i>

23:25.882 --> 23:27.971
<i>probably was throwing</i> <i>
more gas in on it.</i>

23:28.015 --> 23:29.973
Yeah, but, like,
I'm just defending myself.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.192
Right.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.889
And then Margaret
had her Pride party.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.543
<i>She had everybody there</i> <i>
except me.</i>

23:34.587 --> 23:36.458
So I don't know

23:36.502 --> 23:37.633
how it's gonna be
at Teresa's summer party.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.722
Just, you know,
take the high road.

23:39.766 --> 23:41.289
Listen, I'm not going there
to fight with anybody.

23:41.332 --> 23:42.899
I'm excited
to hang out with Luis.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.814
- Yeah.
- Bill and I have gone out

23:44.858 --> 23:48.339
to dinner with Luis
and Teresa a few times now.

23:48.383 --> 23:49.471
You know, I know this video
has been

23:49.515 --> 23:50.690
going around about him.

23:50.733 --> 23:52.300

he's always working.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.170
- Okay.
- And then when I need

32:35.214 --> 32:36.563
a fill-in,
I have my ex-husband.

32:36.606 --> 32:37.999
He's away with his girlfriend
right now in Texas

32:38.043 --> 32:40.393
or something, so him
and his cowboy hat.

32:42.351 --> 32:45.180
<i>♪</i>

32:45.224 --> 32:48.749
- Hi.
- Hey, summer sexy.

32:48.792 --> 32:51.534
- I gotta wash my hands.
- By the way.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.145
I don't think Teresa
will bring up the video.

32:53.188 --> 32:55.147
I think it's a little weird.

32:56.539 --> 32:58.280
How far away are you?

32:58.324 --> 33:00.979
Okay. Why?

33:02.893 --> 33:04.504
Well, I guess
she's stressed out.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.201
There was, like, a little
thing last night, too.

33:06.245 --> 33:07.681
Like we almost didn't come.

33:07.724 --> 33:11.119
- Really?
- All right. I love you.

33:11.163 --> 33:12.816
<i>Yesterday my sister</i> <i>
calls me up</i>

33:12.860 --> 33:14.035
and starts bitching at me.
She like,

33:14.079 --> 33:15.036
"What did you say about Luis?"

33:15.080 --> 33:16.298
<i>You know, he got upset.</i>

33:16.342 --> 33:17.691
Well, people laughed.

33:17.734 --> 33:18.866
It was funny.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.302
Teresa, I wanna let you know

33:20.346 --> 33:23.001
what happened in Atlantic City.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.959
- What?
- When they were on stage,

33:25.003 --> 33:29.616
somebody said "How do you feel
about Luis" to your brother,

33:29.659 --> 33:32.662
and he goes, "Oh, I'm missing
Joe Giudice right now."

33:32.706 --> 33:35.056
Aww, I like that.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.841
<i>"Oh, I like that.</i> <i>
That was nice."</i>

33:37.885 --> 33:39.756
No, it's not.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.976
I wouldn't like it.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.892
And I'm surprised you do.
Luis' okay with it?

33:44.935 --> 33:46.198
I mean, I have to tell him.

33:46.241 --> 33:48.852
I'm just playing dumb.
Like yeah, really?

33:48.896 --> 33:50.593
But I'm sure
he'll be fine with it.

33:50.637 --> 33:53.901
Nobody should even be
getting into Luis' business

33:53.944 --> 33:55.337
like if he cares,
if he doesn't care.

33:55.381 --> 33:57.209
<i>So it's better to pretend</i>

33:57.252 --> 34:00.038
<i>I don't know about it</i> <i>
to not cause any issues.</i>

34:00.081 --> 34:02.475
- It was a comedy show. Relax.
- I'm sorry.

34:02.518 --> 34:03.519
You can't have
all this sh-- out there

34:03.563 --> 34:05.043
and expect no one
to talk about it.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.567
- Right.
- Oh, he's here.

34:11.179 --> 34:13.616
- I'll take a seltzer.
- Sure.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.053
Luis should just address
the video.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.184
Once you actually
address it,

34:16.228 --> 34:17.577
then the elephant goes away.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.839
Yeah.

34:21.102 --> 34:22.103
Hey, babe.

34:22.147 --> 34:24.758
- Hi.
- How are you?

34:24.801 --> 34:26.760
I love you.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.805
You know, Luis' here.
This video came out about--

34:28.849 --> 34:30.285
- I didn't see it.
- Oh.

34:30.329 --> 34:32.505
He's sitting in the middle
of a bunch of guys.

34:32.548 --> 34:34.333
It looks like none of them
have any clothes on

34:34.376 --> 34:37.162
and he's apologizing
to a girlfriend.

34:37.205 --> 34:40.513
But it's like a really freaky
frickin' thing.

34:40.556 --> 34:43.472
I just want to say like
Teresa, we care about you.

34:43.516 --> 34:46.127
This is a concern.
- Don't make a big deal.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.389
She just doesn't want anyone

34:47.433 --> 34:48.956
saying anything
about Luis, understand?

34:48.999 --> 34:51.437
- What are you eating?
- Everything.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.873
It's too much.

34:52.916 --> 34:54.004
- Hey, Joe.
- What's up?

34:54.048 --> 34:55.919
How are you doing?
Good to see you.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.356
- Yeah.
- You know Tony.

34:57.399 --> 34:58.400
Yeah.

34:58.444 --> 34:59.967
<i>Luis comes up,</i> <i>
being fake to me</i>

<i>We're just like</i> <i>
this big happy family.</i>

35:03.797 --> 35:05.233
It's all bullsh--.

35:05.277 --> 35:07.844
Luis appears to be nervous.

35:07.888 --> 35:09.933
I'm sure. Who wouldn't be,
walking into the ----ing

35:09.977 --> 35:11.761
lion's den over here?

35:11.805 --> 35:13.023
How you been, man?

35:13.067 --> 35:14.808
He has to understand Melissa

35:14.851 --> 35:16.766
was telling me they had
a big family feud last night.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.420
Luis told Teresa

35:18.464 --> 35:21.510
he was upset
what Joe said on the stage.

35:21.554 --> 35:24.209
She ----ing told me
she's fine with it.

35:24.252 --> 35:26.167
That's not what
Melissa told me.

35:26.211 --> 35:27.647
Said they almost
didn't make it here.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.170
Know what the issue is?
Like, that's how bad it was.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.563
- You're ----ing kidding me.
- No.

35:30.606 --> 35:32.173
When you're pretending
you don't care

35:32.217 --> 35:33.348
and you're lying about it,

35:33.392 --> 35:34.828
it makes you look
like you do care.

35:34.871 --> 35:38.136
I'm telling you, I think
Teresa's sugarcoating it all.

35:40.660 --> 35:43.402
It's not abnormal
for everybody to be like,

35:43.445 --> 35:45.143
"What's--what's going on here?"

35:45.186 --> 35:46.274
- Whatever.
- Teresa.

35:46.318 --> 35:47.971
- What?
- Listen.

35:48.015 --> 35:52.280
I think Luis
has to address the video.

35:52.324 --> 35:54.282
Listen, that's part
of his past,

35:54.326 --> 35:56.066
so he doesn't owe anybody
an explanation

35:56.110 --> 35:57.503
about anything, you know.

35:57.546 --> 35:59.069
No, I'm not saying he owes
anybody an explanation.

35:59.113 --> 36:01.594
Yeah.
I think he's an amazing man.

36:01.637 --> 36:06.076
I go by how me and Luis
are present and future.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.774
- I understand that.
- I have a past.

36:07.817 --> 36:09.471
He has a past. I don't care.

36:09.515 --> 36:11.821
And I want everybody
to do the right thing

36:11.865 --> 36:13.171

The last time we were here,
her face was on the pavement.

36:52.645 --> 36:54.386
That's the new Jennifer.
Just water.

36:54.429 --> 36:56.126
I gotta get a drink.

36:58.477 --> 37:01.219
The fact that she would go
after our livelihood

37:01.262 --> 37:02.437

She tried to destroy
Margaret and my friendship.

37:09.488 --> 37:13.100
She tried to destroy Margaret
and Melissa's friendship.

37:13.143 --> 37:15.015
Margaret said my husband's
a plumber.

37:15.058 --> 37:17.931
You think we don't know
Joe Gorga doesn't pay people?

37:17.974 --> 37:20.325
She called you guys crooked.

slut-shames Margaret

Hey.

You look beautiful.

She looks totally different.
She's unrecognizable.

37:34.687 --> 37:36.079
Oh, the nose.

37:36.123 --> 37:38.168
Jen, I just told them
you had your nose done.

beautiful before this.

- Okay.

Maybe I need
to see it up close.

I can't handle. Hi.

- Luis. Sit by me.
- So Frankie is doing good.

He's one of the best guys
I've ever worked with.

- Really? He looks up to you.
- Hey, Sweetie. Muah.

feels awkward.

- Hey, babe, you have a minute?
- Yeah, yeah.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.092
She needs to do
the apology tour.

38:32.135 --> 38:33.267
How am I supposed to act
when, like,

38:33.311 --> 38:35.487
they just all walked
past me like that?

38:35.530 --> 38:37.010
Who walked past you?

38:37.053 --> 38:40.709
All of them when
we were standing right here.

38:40.753 --> 38:43.451
Obviously, I saw Melissa
was still mad at me

38:43.495 --> 38:44.757
when she posted that thing.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.846
I realized
Margaret was mad at me

38:46.889 --> 38:48.500
when she didn't invite me
to her Pride party.

38:48.543 --> 38:50.980
But Jackie, I thought we were
gonna let bygones be bygones.

38:51.024 --> 38:52.460
Well, did you talk to Jackie?

38:52.504 --> 38:53.548
No, I'm not like--

38:53.592 --> 38:54.593
Want me to get Jackie here?

38:54.636 --> 38:55.768
- Yeah.
- All right.

38:55.811 --> 38:57.073
She was vicious towards you.

38:57.117 --> 38:58.771
She was vicious
towards both of you.

38:58.814 --> 39:01.687
- Jackie, come here.
- Yeah.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.428
She wants to say hi to you.

39:03.471 --> 39:04.603
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:04.646 --> 39:06.300
She wants
to say hi to Jackie.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.694
- Cheers. Cheers. Okay.
- Yes, cheers.

39:08.737 --> 39:11.087
My house,
all happiness, love.

39:11.131 --> 39:14.961
Yeah. Okay.
Are you mad at me?

39:15.004 --> 39:16.832
- I'm upset with you.
- Okay,

39:16.876 --> 39:19.313
'cause I really thought
the last time

39:19.357 --> 39:22.142
we all saw each other,
we all ended on a good note

39:22.185 --> 39:23.926
and I would love it
if you could just tell me

39:23.970 --> 39:26.015
why you're mad at me
and then maybe I could fix it.

39:26.059 --> 39:27.277
Yeah, okay. Well, you know

39:27.321 --> 39:29.323
that Margaret is
one of my best friends

39:29.367 --> 39:30.672
and you concocted a story

39:30.716 --> 39:32.544
to try and drive
a big wedge between us.

39:32.587 --> 39:33.980
You also thought
that Margaret

39:34.023 --> 39:35.503
was the source of the rumor.

39:35.547 --> 39:36.635
It's just a theory.

39:36.678 --> 39:39.028
I shouldn't have said it.
I regret it.

39:39.072 --> 39:40.987
But do you know how hard
it is for me knowing

39:41.030 --> 39:43.816
that it's all three of you
against me?

39:43.859 --> 39:45.644
Well, Jennifer,
you did that to yourself.

39:45.687 --> 39:46.993
The things that you say.

39:47.036 --> 39:49.256
What's going on
with Jennifer and Jackie?

39:49.299 --> 39:50.823
I don't know.

39:50.866 --> 39:52.302
Listen, you guys
got to understand.

39:52.346 --> 39:54.087
I think I'm great friends
with Teresa and Dolores,

39:54.130 --> 39:56.045
but I do believe also
that they don't stick by me

39:56.089 --> 39:58.657
the way that you three do
and that's okay.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.006
No, don't cry.
Don't cry.

40:00.049 --> 40:01.442
I don't want you to feel alone.

40:01.486 --> 40:03.401
I mean, I don't get
anything out of seeing

40:03.444 --> 40:04.880
one person feel alone.

40:04.924 --> 40:06.534
I'm a forgiver, okay?
- Okay.

40:06.578 --> 40:09.885
So if you're a friend to me,
I'll be a friend to you, okay?

40:09.929 --> 40:12.453
I think you need to talk
to Melissa and Margaret.

40:12.497 --> 40:15.064
I almost want to drag Jackie
out of that conversation.

40:15.108 --> 40:17.197
Margaret, I want to talk to.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.764
But I don't think I need
to apologize to her.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.592
She started with me that day.

40:20.635 --> 40:21.810
Hi.

40:21.854 --> 40:23.464
I was talking to Jackie

40:23.508 --> 40:26.032
'cause I was just wondering
why she was mad at me.

40:26.075 --> 40:28.469
I mean, we've come
to our own understanding,

40:28.513 --> 40:30.210
but I do think that you guys

40:30.253 --> 40:34.519
need to figure out
what your understanding is.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.172
I was a little shocked.

40:36.216 --> 40:39.785
You called me
a snake in the group.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.874
- Yeah, I call--
- I'm gonna let you guys talk.

40:41.917 --> 40:43.441
Yeah, I call it
when I see it.

40:43.484 --> 40:45.617
- Jennifer.
- Listen, it was tit for tat.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.967
When I give it back to you,
all of a sudden, you're mad.

40:48.010 --> 40:49.838
But you never know
when to stop.

40:49.882 --> 40:52.101
- What happened?
- I mean, it was awkward.

40:52.145 --> 40:54.190
But she was like, "I understand
why they're mad at me.

40:54.234 --> 40:56.932
Why are you mad at me?"
She cried.

40:56.976 --> 40:58.717
I think that you
are unhappy.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.501
I get that that's your truth.

41:00.545 --> 41:03.112
I get that and you're totally
entitled to your opinion.

41:03.156 --> 41:05.027
Ooh. Are they fighting?

41:05.071 --> 41:07.377
I wake up feeling blessed.

41:07.421 --> 41:10.076
I love my house.
I love my husband.

41:10.119 --> 41:11.773
He allowed me
to make things happen

41:11.817 --> 41:13.471
that never
could have happened for me

41:13.514 --> 41:15.516
without having a man
nag me about the bill.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.997
Do you know what a ----ing
blessing that is?

41:18.040 --> 41:19.825
It's not about
the ----ing money, Jennifer.

41:21.261 --> 41:23.263
Look at Marge and Jennifer
over there.

41:23.306 --> 41:25.570
It's not about the money,
but it is about him

41:25.613 --> 41:27.006
trying to do everything he can

41:27.049 --> 41:29.574
to let me
be the perfect mom to my kids.

41:29.617 --> 41:31.837
Marge should throw her
right in the pool, bro.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.360
He's spending his life

41:33.403 --> 41:34.753
making up for mistakes
he's made in the past.

41:34.796 --> 41:36.450
- Mistake he's made? Okay.
- Yes.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.234
You know what?
You're just jealous.

41:38.278 --> 41:39.671
You're not being honest.

41:39.714 --> 41:42.456
How do you know
about my honesty?

41:42.500 --> 41:43.631
Jennifer, we all know.

41:43.675 --> 41:45.154
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah.

41:45.198 --> 41:46.591
No, she keeps saying
I'm not being honest

41:46.634 --> 41:48.375
and I don't know what
I'm not being honest about.

41:48.418 --> 41:49.855
I don't--I'm not gonna
do it here.

41:49.898 --> 41:51.291
She's mad
that I called her a snake.

41:51.334 --> 41:53.685
Everyone's got ----ing
skeletons in the closet.

41:53.728 --> 41:55.121
But you talk about everybody
else's but never your own.

41:55.164 --> 41:56.862
I don't talk
about anybody else's.

41:56.905 --> 41:58.341
You attacked me
from the beginning.

41:58.385 --> 42:00.430
The way
that she met her husband

42:00.474 --> 42:01.823
I thought was very taboo.

42:01.867 --> 42:03.477
It felt shameless to me.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.088
And you attacked my mother
and you called her slutty.

42:06.132 --> 42:07.960
You know what, Margaret?

42:08.003 --> 42:09.309
You're used to
an environment of cheating.

42:09.352 --> 42:11.833
Your mother ----ed someone
for 15 years.

42:11.877 --> 42:13.618
I get it!

42:13.661 --> 42:15.489
You make it out like you're
better than everybody else.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.230
I don't think I'm better
than everybody else.

42:17.273 --> 42:20.015
I can't relate to people
who have affairs

42:20.059 --> 42:21.539
with married people.

42:21.582 --> 42:22.931
I guarantee you someone

42:22.975 --> 42:25.151
in the Syrian Christian
Orthodox community

42:25.194 --> 42:26.456
has ----ed somebody else's
wife or husband.

42:26.500 --> 42:27.806
I'm sure they have.

42:27.849 --> 42:29.416
But you chastise me--

42:29.459 --> 42:31.810
Because you were
so vocal about it.

42:31.853 --> 42:33.638
Because it's so shameful,
right?

42:33.681 --> 42:35.117
You're not honest.

42:35.161 --> 42:37.032
- I'm being honest.
- You're not.

42:37.076 --> 42:39.252
You can't ----ing take it
how honest I am.

42:39.295 --> 42:41.210
You always say,
"Bill's the best."

42:41.254 --> 42:42.690
Listen, he had an affair.
- You're jealous.

42:42.734 --> 42:45.737
Everybody knows, and that's
why he left his old job.

42:45.780 --> 42:48.783
Her marriage isn't as perfect
as she says it is.

42:48.827 --> 42:51.830
Bill had the affair with the
office manager for two years.

42:51.873 --> 42:53.135
She's not an office manager.

42:53.179 --> 42:54.659
She was a ----ing
pharmaceutical rep,

42:54.702 --> 42:55.921
you ----ing idiot,
if you can get the facts right.

42:55.964 --> 42:57.531
Okay.

42:57.575 --> 43:00.621
