01:43.400 --> 01:48.110
Hey, Captain America.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.235
-What's up, brother?
-Hey, bro.

02:08.759 --> 02:10.751
This is stupid.

02:11.400 --> 02:15.632
-You got a better idea?
-Okay, fun. Whatever.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.832
-So when do we, you know?
-We don't, for now.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.156
No cooking until things settle down.

02:21.360 --> 02:25.069
Settle down? I thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.316
Look, I just put my family
through an ordeal...

02:27.520 --> 02:31.798
...that they're just now
starting to accept, okay? I can't--

02:33.520 --> 02:34.475
That's too expensive.

02:43.640 --> 02:46.029
Look, I can't leave my house...

02:46.240 --> 02:48.515
...for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.472
I need time to mend fences.

02:50.680 --> 02:54.355
Okay, so while you're fixing fences,
what about me, huh?

02:54.560 --> 02:58.030
Your A-hole brother-in-law
took all my money.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.439
That's $600.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.959
Okay, what about the rest?

03:13.760 --> 03:16.433
-Rest of what?
-Half your money's mine.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.756
Fifty-fifty partners.
That's our business motto.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.997
Meaning what, exactly?
That I suffer for your carelessness?

03:22.200 --> 03:24.077
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.033
Okay. If it weren't for that,
none of this would've happened.

03:32.120 --> 03:36.272
Just be cool.
We'll talk about this later, okay?

03:36.760 --> 03:40.036
As for now, no contact. Understood?

03:42.520 --> 03:43.475
Where are you going?

03:44.880 --> 03:46.359
I leave first.

04:03.080 --> 04:06.755
-Walt!
-ln the kitchen.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.754
Hey.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.916
Hey. I didn't know
you were allowed to touch the stove.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.271
Hilarious, Groucho.
Go on, grab a seat.

04:30.480 --> 04:31.959
Juice is on the table.

04:36.320 --> 04:37.275
What?

04:39.360 --> 04:42.079
-Good morning, honey.
-Hey, Mom.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.714
Dad's cooking breakfast.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.639
But don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.916
Nice? Follow me.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.998
There's also orange juice
and grapefruit juice...

04:55.200 --> 04:58.033
...which, personally, as you know,
I've never been a fan of.

04:58.240 --> 05:02.199
But considering all the polyphenols
and the limonoids, can't hurt.

05:02.400 --> 05:06.029
Walt, you didn't have to do this.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.433
I wanted to.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.398
-Grapefruit juice?
-Yes, please. Thanks.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.995
There you go. Honey?

05:18.200 --> 05:20.430
No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.

05:21.520 --> 05:25.911
All right. Dig in, dig in.
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.593
-Yeah.
-There you go.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.189
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.233
-No.
-Yes, absolutely.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.908
No, in terms of pure musicianship...

05:36.120 --> 05:38.839
...I would put them up against
any current band you can name.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.474
You wouldn't know
any current bands.

05:42.280 --> 05:44.669
-That's besides the point.
-Have a good day, honey.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.359
You too.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.672
-Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
-Boz Scaggs.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.236
Whoever they are.
Bye. Thanks for breakfast.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.395
-Bye.
-You're welcome.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.113
Tell Louis to drive carefully.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.673
All right.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.710
Our son doesn't know
who Boz Scaggs is.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.070
We have failed as parents.

06:07.760 --> 06:08.715
Come to think of it...

06:08.920 --> 06:11.434
-...I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.
-Stop it.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.677
Give me your plate.
No, no. I'll get it. I'll get it. Yeah.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.233
Thank you.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.712
Hey, listen...

06:19.920 --> 06:22.036
...in the calendar section...

06:22.600 --> 06:24.591
...all week long...

06:25.280 --> 06:28.955
...there's a fiction writer's seminar
at UNM.

06:29.160 --> 06:32.391
And, you know, probably talking
about how to get published...

06:32.600 --> 06:34.989
-...and that sort of thing.
-Yeah?

06:35.840 --> 06:40.789
Yeah, so, anyway,
I thought maybe you might....

06:41.720 --> 06:43.711
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.711
Oh, and...

06:57.400 --> 07:00.676
...you know, I was thinking about
what you asked me the other night.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.110
You were wondering
if I had a second cell phone.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.709
And, well, I've been
thinking about that a lot...

07:05.920 --> 07:10.835
...and I think what you heard
was my cell phone alarm going off.

07:13.080 --> 07:17.232
I've been using it a lot
as a medication reminder...

07:17.720 --> 07:20.439
...to, well, remind me
to take my medication.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.434
And, well, the weird thing is that...

07:24.640 --> 07:28.269
...the alarm sound
is almost exactly the same...

07:28.480 --> 07:31.472
...as the regular phone ring
which is really a poor design...

07:31.680 --> 07:35.150
...if you ask me.
But I think that was probably it.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.352
I tried to go in
and change it to a different sound...

07:38.560 --> 07:40.755
...other than the phone ring, but....

07:41.120 --> 07:43.998
They so overcomplicate
these things.

07:44.720 --> 07:49.396
Anyway, it was probably
just as well that I lost it.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.629
There's gotta be a new one
on the market by now.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.515
You know, if we do this thing
at UNM, maybe on the way home...

07:56.720 --> 07:59.632
...we can stop by,
and I can get a new cell phone.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.479
Skyler?

08:16.200 --> 08:17.235
Skyler?

09:05.280 --> 09:08.078
-Ready?
-Yo, for what, might help.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.320
Not another intervention.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.151
Jesse Bruce Pinkman...

09:30.360 --> 09:33.079
...pursuant to Section 47-8-13...

09:33.280 --> 09:35.157
...of the New Mexico
Real Property Code...

09:35.360 --> 09:37.191
...you are hereby
given notice to vacate...

09:37.400 --> 09:41.757
...the premises listed as 9809 Margo,
Albuquerque, 87104.

09:41.960 --> 09:45.077
Wait. What? You're kicking me
out of my own house?

09:45.280 --> 09:47.589
-It's your aunt Ginny's house.
-And she gave it to me.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.233
She never gave it to you, Jesse.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.079
You were allowed
residentiary privileges.

09:52.280 --> 09:55.397
Your parents have always
been the property owners.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.149
Look, we talked about this, okay?
I'd sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.669
That was the deal.
What the hell happened?

10:01.880 --> 10:04.440
What happened is
you're a speed manufacturer.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.835
No, I'm not. What?

10:07.040 --> 10:10.476
A DEA agent came
looking for you, Jesse.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.875
He came to our front door.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.629
Okay, because I've actually
been helping them...

10:19.840 --> 10:23.469
...which I could get into
a lot of trouble for telling you...

10:23.680 --> 10:25.557
...so you're welcome.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.830
I saw your basement.

10:28.800 --> 10:29.869
Oh, yeah.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.789
I was worried, so I went
over there and I let myself in...

10:34.000 --> 10:38.198
...and I found your laboratory.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.990
You guys have your own key?

10:49.160 --> 10:52.550
Manufacture of a Schedule ll
controlled substance...

10:53.320 --> 10:55.390
...is a second degree felony.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.713
Under federal asset seizure...

10:58.920 --> 11:01.957
...the government can take
the entire house.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.676
It's not even there anymore.
I cleaned it all out.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.269
Son, we can't stop you
from ruining your life...

11:08.480 --> 11:11.756
...but you will not drag us down
with you.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.799
Vacate the house in 72 hours.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.911
Otherwise,
your parents have authorised me...

11:17.120 --> 11:20.396
...to contact the authorities.
Is that clear?

11:21.840 --> 11:24.035
Do you have any questions for us?

11:27.280 --> 11:28.918
Three days, Mr. Pinkman.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.154
Come on.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.679
-Hi.
-Hey.

12:20.080 --> 12:23.789
-I fixed the garage door.
-Great.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.353
Yeah.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.120
One track was bent.
That's why it was bouncing.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.799
Okay.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.519
-Where were you today?
-Out.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.631
Is everything okay?

12:49.600 --> 12:52.478
Yeah, everything's fine.

13:05.440 --> 13:10.833
Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking
about going back to those meetings...

13:11.040 --> 13:12.837
...the cancer support group.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.792
I think that that's good.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.554
Yeah.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.550
Yeah, that's good.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.594
You were right
on the money about that.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.991
It's good to, you know...

13:26.800 --> 13:28.836
...talk about things.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.357
I think that's great.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.838
Yeah.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.033
Jesse.

14:05.280 --> 14:08.909
Jesse. Hey, Jesse.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.509
You don't answer your phone?

14:13.040 --> 14:14.951
Yeah, no, I've just been...

14:15.160 --> 14:17.674
...pretty busy. How'd you--?

14:17.880 --> 14:21.475
Oh, right, you have that key.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.916
Hey, listen.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.194
So I've been thinking
a lot about our conversation...

14:27.400 --> 14:31.632
...we had the other day,
and I completely get why...

14:31.840 --> 14:35.037
...Dad totally tweaked off on me
like that and....

14:35.240 --> 14:38.789
-It's not just your father, Jesse.
-No, I know. I know. I know.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.994
I'm just saying it was a really,
really big wake-up call for me...

14:44.200 --> 14:47.033
...which is why I wanted to talk
to you. You know, I've been...

14:47.240 --> 14:50.516
...thinking real seriously
about business school, actually.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.075
You can do the whole thing
from your computer now....

14:53.280 --> 14:56.636
No, Mom, Mom.
Hey, hey, this is good.

14:56.840 --> 15:00.435
You know, we're talking,
starting a dialogue.

15:00.640 --> 15:03.837
The time for talking
has passed, Jesse.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.111
Hey. Hey.

15:07.320 --> 15:08.639
What the hell, yo?

15:08.840 --> 15:11.877
-I thought it was just a wake-up call.
-We are putting it in storage.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.196
When you decide to grow up,
you can have it back.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.595
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

15:16.800 --> 15:19.792
Ginny wanted me here.
I was the one who took care of her.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.151
I took her to her appointments
and made her lunch every day.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.554
I earned this.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.990
You did not make
her lunch every day.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.872
What did you do, huh?

15:29.080 --> 15:31.640
She's lying there dying,
and where the hell are you?

15:31.840 --> 15:34.035
-Don't start with me.
-Now what?

15:34.240 --> 15:37.391
You've decided to, I don't know,
make your eldest son homeless?

15:38.560 --> 15:40.710
Great family, Mom.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.676
Why are you like this? Why?

15:53.560 --> 15:58.588
You have two sets of keys
and the padlock to the garage.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.508
Leave them on the kitchen counter
when you leave.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.039
No, Mom, Mom, Mom.

16:03.240 --> 16:06.198
Hey, where am I supposed to go?

16:07.440 --> 16:09.556
I don't know, sweetheart.

16:10.760 --> 16:15.788
But please turn your life around.

16:16.760 --> 16:20.912
Yeah, this is gonna help
bigtime with that. Bitch!

16:23.040 --> 16:24.871
Jeez.

16:36.720 --> 16:37.869
Oh, hey, Mr. White.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.719
Hey, well, that's the way.
Don't just sit out there honking.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.194
Come in and say hello.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.153
Hey, we've got omelettes.
You want an omelette?

16:45.400 --> 16:46.355
No, I'm good.

16:46.560 --> 16:49.393
New Mexican Christmas style,
red and green chillies.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.397
No. Thank you, though.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.239
Flynn and me gotta get going.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.077
-Who's Flynn?
-Flynn.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.157
He's your....

17:01.720 --> 17:04.951
-Flynn?
-Yeah.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.673
So?

17:07.760 --> 17:09.637
So? Nothing.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.349
-You ready?
-Like it.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.198
-Bye, Mr. White.
-Okay.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.439
Bye.

17:23.560 --> 17:27.348
Flynn? You know about this
Flynn thing?

17:31.520 --> 17:35.069
Okay. Flynn. Yeah.
As in what, Errol?

17:35.280 --> 17:38.397
I don't know. It's what he likes
to be called these days.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.397
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?

17:40.600 --> 17:42.511
Don't take it personally.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.556
He wants his own identity.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.312
You think he told Louis about me?

17:53.520 --> 17:56.830
-About the blackout?
-Louis is his friend, Walt...

17:57.040 --> 17:59.508
...and your disappearance
upset him.

18:03.240 --> 18:06.710
Hey, I made omelettes.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.354
I'm going out, but thanks, though.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.039
Where you going?

18:12.440 --> 18:14.476
Can you get the phone, please?

18:15.720 --> 18:19.156
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.989
-White residence.
-Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?

18:27.800 --> 18:31.190
What part of "no contact"
didn't you understand?

18:31.400 --> 18:34.392
-I know, but there's a problem.
-I don't care. We agreed.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.558
No amount of pay-per-view channels
is gonna make any difference.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.955
Honey, we're happy
with our cable provider, right?

18:41.440 --> 18:43.874
Yeah, we're happy.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.791
Skyler? Sky?

18:50.360 --> 18:53.875
Where are you going?
Can you at least tell me that?

18:54.080 --> 18:55.433
Out.

18:56.640 --> 19:00.315
Should probably get that, Walt.
I'll be back in a few hours.

19:00.760 --> 19:02.432
Skyler.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.598
-What?
-Yo, I get I shouldn't call...

19:10.800 --> 19:13.155
...but I'm in a situation here,
and I need my money.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.998
I just gave you $600.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.428
And thanks, Daddy Warbucks...

19:16.640 --> 19:18.631
...but that was
before my housing situation...

19:18.840 --> 19:20.876
...went completely
testicular on me, okay?

19:21.080 --> 19:22.991
You smoked the entire 600,
didn't you?

19:23.200 --> 19:24.428
-What? No.
-Yes.

19:24.640 --> 19:25.675
-No.
-Look, Jesse...

19:25.880 --> 19:27.359
...your problems are just that:

19:27.560 --> 19:29.152
Your problems.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.954
No contact. Do not call here ever.

19:32.160 --> 19:35.869
-When the moment is right, I will call.
-Mr. White, you're not listening.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.196
They're kicking me out of my house.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.832
You son of a bitch.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.276
Son of a bitch.

19:58.920 --> 20:01.070
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.113
Thanks, man. Hey, guy!
You forgot something! Yeah!

20:04.320 --> 20:07.790
You forgot your ice trays!
You're gonna need the ice trays!

20:08.000 --> 20:11.231
Hey, you forgot something here!
Take this!

20:50.120 --> 20:51.394
Hold on, buddy.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.672
Yo, we should get Twaughthammer
up and running again, yo. I'm serious.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.916
I know. That sounded tight.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.872
Hey, thanks again, P.

20:59.080 --> 21:02.914
I made sure this stucknut exterminator,
you know, put me on his speed dial.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.189
Two nights tops.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.709
No, you still staying
at your aunt's on Margo?

21:06.920 --> 21:09.309
Yeah. I'm thinking of moving.
Nob Hill, probably.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.718
Jess-a-matic. Living the dream.

21:13.960 --> 21:14.915
Yeah.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.157
Okay, buddy. You're gonna eat your
carrots like we talked about, right?

21:18.360 --> 21:19.315
Too hot.

21:19.520 --> 21:22.432
No, no, buddy. Remember. Okay?
Come on, yes.

21:22.640 --> 21:23.993
Listen, hey, talk to me, man.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.589
Are you still having
mad relations out there?

21:26.800 --> 21:28.836
You can talk to me.
I won't hate a player.

21:29.040 --> 21:33.636
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic
out there, female-wise.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.915
Damn. I'm hating, man.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.918
That's why we need to get the Hammer
up and running, you know?

21:40.120 --> 21:43.556
-Get you out of the house.
-How awesome would that be?

21:43.760 --> 21:45.352
Come on. Look. What?

21:45.720 --> 21:48.917
I cut all the green parts off like you--
Just eat them. Please?

21:49.120 --> 21:52.556
We should do this. Track down
Cheevo and Anthony and demo up.

21:52.760 --> 21:53.829
Get back in the scene.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.755
I'm sorry, man.
Just hold on one second, all right?

21:56.960 --> 21:59.918
Okay, listen. How about
you take a bite of your sandwich...

22:00.120 --> 22:01.712
...and then you take--

22:02.440 --> 22:04.396
Mommy's home.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.355
-Hi.
-Hello.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.869
Hey, honey, you remember
Jesse Pinkman?

22:10.760 --> 22:13.718
His house is getting bug bombed.
I said he could crash a few nights.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.751
-Hey, Jesse.
-Hey.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.349
Paul, could you help me
in the bedroom with these?

22:20.200 --> 22:22.760
Sure. Yeah.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.397
Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too.

22:48.520 --> 22:53.116
Hey, Hen, I think
it's someone's nap time. Come on.

23:02.160 --> 23:05.357
Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.

23:05.560 --> 23:09.997
I totally spaced that the in-laws
are crashing this weekend.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.553
You got other people to call?

23:11.760 --> 23:14.035
No, that's cool.
I got tons of people. Yeah.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.276
-Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.797
Yo, in-laws?

23:20.000 --> 23:23.629
-Sucks to be you, P.
-Yeah. Yeah, I know, huh?

23:24.680 --> 23:26.238
Here.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.793
See you, man.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.911
It's good to see you.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.991
Look, I'm asking to crash three,
maybe four nights, and--

23:35.200 --> 23:38.033
Look, I already called Badger,
all right? I called everyone.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.595
I need a solid here, bro.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.153
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

23:44.800 --> 23:48.110
All right. All right.
Hey, how about this?

23:48.600 --> 23:50.909
What if it's just for tonight?

24:08.080 --> 24:10.833
Wait. No, you cannot be serious.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.998
-You cannot be serious.
-Hey.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.229
Someone took your bike, man.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.351
Not cool.

27:25.040 --> 27:28.271
-Morning.
-Oh, hey.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.799
Morning.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.993
Where did--? Where did Mom go?

27:34.720 --> 27:36.358
Out.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.470
Where's breakfast?

27:48.320 --> 27:49.548
Hey.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.472
Let's go do something.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.232
Like what?

27:56.160 --> 27:58.151
Something fun.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.758
All right, ready? Let's put it in gear.

28:02.960 --> 28:06.839
-ls your foot on the-- Okay. Good.
-Yeah. I got it.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.035
Good.

28:11.240 --> 28:14.710
Yes. Nice and smooth. Good.
Just like that.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.352
Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2.
Very nice.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.755
Okay, let's slow down here...

28:20.960 --> 28:23.952
...to a stop in preparation
for a left-hand turn. Okay.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.958
All right. You might wanna
go easier on the brake.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.754
-Sorry about that.
-That's all right. You're doing fine.

28:29.960 --> 28:33.714
-Much better than last time, huh?
-Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.119
Has he?

28:36.320 --> 28:38.550
Good. Good. Okay.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.716
Don't forget the turn indic-- Good.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.229
I'll stop talking.
You know what you're doing.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.159
And let's make that left-hand turn.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.914
Nice and smooth. Very nice.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.639
Right hand.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.555
Good. Good. Okay.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.755
-Are you using both feet?
-Yeah.

29:01.960 --> 29:04.030
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
You can't do that.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.276
You can't use one foot
on each pedal.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.074
-Why not?
-Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.

29:09.280 --> 29:13.831
-Just stop, please. Right. All right.
-Dad, this is way easier.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.119
There's the easy way,
and then there's the right way, right?

29:17.320 --> 29:20.278
So let's just try it again,
right foot only.

29:20.480 --> 29:22.118
-All right.
-Okay?

29:26.520 --> 29:29.796
Okay, just-- You don't have to--
Okay. All right. That's fine.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.753
Just-- That's okay. That's okay.
Just try it again.

29:32.960 --> 29:36.589
Here we go.
Let's just, just try it again.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.953
Okay.

29:39.160 --> 29:42.391
Don't-- Just easy.
Okay, okay, good. Great.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.989
That was better. See?
Right? Better? Right.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.838
The gas, the brake,
the gas, the brake.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.439
I can't do this.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.718
My legs don't work that way.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.639
Your legs are fine.
You just have to stick with it.

29:53.840 --> 29:56.638
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.
You're all right.

29:56.840 --> 30:00.116
All right. We'll get this. I promise.
Now let's just try again. All right?

30:00.320 --> 30:02.390
-All right.
-Here we go. Here we go.

30:04.440 --> 30:07.273
Okay, well, you don't need to,
you know, just take off.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.119
But all right, here we go.
Slow it down just a little bit.

30:10.320 --> 30:14.791
All right, we have a turn coming up
here, so prepare to apply the brakes.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.230
Prepare, Walt, for the brakes.
Brakes, the brakes.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.158
-Braking.
-You're using both feet again.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.555
-It's not stopping.
-That's the gas. Use the brake.

30:21.760 --> 30:23.478
The break. Brake, brake, brake!

30:28.400 --> 30:29.719
Okay.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.038
That's one way to stop.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.672
I told you.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.279
Flynn.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.398
-Hands up, asshole!
-Yo, yo, it's cool.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.158
So help me, I will spread you.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.318
No, please, no, all right?
It's me, okay? It's Jesse.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.236
All right? Look, this is my RV.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.954
You towed it.
Your cousin Badger, remember?

31:56.160 --> 31:57.991
What the hell you doing here?

31:58.480 --> 32:02.029
-You smell like shit.
-It's a long story.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.629
So I fixed up your felonious
rolling laboratory here...

32:04.840 --> 32:05.989
...750 for the repair.

32:06.200 --> 32:09.272
Make it a grand, counting the toilet
plus the 500 you already owe me...

32:09.480 --> 32:14.031
...and you're good to drive on out of
here to someplace far away. Upwind.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.593
Okay.

32:16.360 --> 32:17.793
Here's the thing.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.319
I can't pay you today.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.795
But I can pay you this week,
all right?

32:22.000 --> 32:27.757
Seventeen fifty? We'll make it 1750,
for, like, you know, interest.

32:27.960 --> 32:30.758
-I thought your word was your bond.
-lt totally is.

32:30.960 --> 32:34.430
Definitely. I just don't have
the money at this particular moment.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.831
But I will, soon.

32:38.280 --> 32:40.157
Here's my counteroffer.

32:40.360 --> 32:43.352
I kick you out.
I take payment from your inventory.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.074
I know a guy that'll pay
premium for this kind of crap.

32:46.280 --> 32:49.636
All right. Two grand. Okay?

32:49.840 --> 32:53.230
Two days, two grand.
That's totally fair.

32:53.440 --> 32:57.718
Just don't take my cook stuff.
All right? That's all I got left.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.150
Please, all right? I really....

33:00.360 --> 33:05.912
God, I really need a break here.
Okay?

33:08.800 --> 33:10.677
Clovis, come on.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.917
I don't know.
There's a bunch of stuff in there.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.714
There's something called
methylamine. Me-- Meth....

33:34.920 --> 33:37.229
However the hell you pronounce it.
Methylamine.

33:37.440 --> 33:40.557
I don't know. I banged on it.
It sounds pretty full to me.

33:47.160 --> 33:49.230
Holy shit. How much?

33:55.960 --> 33:57.234
Hey! Hey!

34:30.880 --> 34:32.108
Skyler.

34:38.199 --> 34:40.589
Louis took Walt to school.

34:42.679 --> 34:44.511
I was thinking maybe...

34:44.960 --> 34:47.076
...this would be a good time to talk.

35:07.840 --> 35:12.914
I dreamt that I owned
an antique bicycle repair shop.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.358
In lreland.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.874
Weird.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.918
Sounds weird.

35:37.840 --> 35:40.195
I wanted to apologise...

35:40.800 --> 35:42.313
...for everything.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.519
My...

35:46.440 --> 35:48.908
...desire for privacy.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.598
My emotional...

35:53.120 --> 35:55.076
...unavailability.

35:56.640 --> 35:59.598
Having cancer
doesn't excuse all that.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.912
I haven't been
a good partner to you...

36:04.760 --> 36:07.638
...and for that...

36:08.520 --> 36:10.272
...I'm very sorry.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.039
I love you.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.631
And I love this family.

36:19.200 --> 36:20.918
And I just...

36:21.480 --> 36:23.198
...want to make sure that...

36:24.160 --> 36:26.196
...we don't lose contact.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.273
Thank you.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.079
Okay.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.559
I agree.

36:58.560 --> 36:59.959
Is that it?

37:01.320 --> 37:02.469
God.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.750
God, how long are
you gonna do this?

37:05.320 --> 37:07.390
-Do what?
-This.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.318
Not talking to me.

37:09.880 --> 37:12.872
Going out all day
and refusing to tell me where.

37:13.080 --> 37:15.230
You are obviously angry with me
about something...

37:15.440 --> 37:17.476
...so let's talk about it.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.039
Oh, God.

37:27.240 --> 37:32.075
I feel like you're upset with me
because you think...

37:32.280 --> 37:35.431
...that I'm up to something.

37:37.320 --> 37:40.357
-Like what?
-I have no idea, Skyler.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.632
What, that I'm having an affair?
Is that it? Is that what you think?

37:43.840 --> 37:45.796
Is that why you asked me
about the....

37:46.000 --> 37:49.231
Some other phone? Because you think
that I'm being unfaithful?

37:51.280 --> 37:53.111
-I don't know.
-Okay.

37:53.320 --> 37:55.117
So ask me.

37:56.560 --> 37:57.959
Why?

37:58.360 --> 38:01.352
-Would you even tell me?
-Yes. I would.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.312
Of course, I would.

38:03.520 --> 38:08.548
And no. I'm not.
I'm not having an affair, okay?

38:08.760 --> 38:11.320
Now, what do I do
to prove that to you?

38:11.520 --> 38:14.830
Swear an oath? My right hand
to God. I'm not having an affair.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.758
I heard you, Walt.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.991
You're not having an affair.

38:19.560 --> 38:20.754
Congratulations.

38:20.960 --> 38:23.269
No, you know what?
Congratulations to you, Skyler.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.515
Great job.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.358
What is this? What do I have to do?

38:26.560 --> 38:30.314
-I'm trying to talk to you, and you--
-Okay, so talk, Walt.

38:30.800 --> 38:34.952
Shut up and say something
that isn't complete bullshit.

38:35.520 --> 38:38.956
You want to know
what you have to do?

38:39.160 --> 38:43.039
You have to tell me
what's really going on right now.

38:43.240 --> 38:45.959
Today. No more excuses.

38:46.160 --> 38:49.994
No more apologies.
No more of these-- These obvious...

38:50.200 --> 38:52.668
...desperate breakfasts.

38:54.080 --> 38:56.992
You don't wanna lose
contact with me, Walt?

38:57.280 --> 38:58.679
Good.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.677
Then tell me.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.633
Now.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.272
Tell you what?

39:21.880 --> 39:23.518
Skyler.

39:26.240 --> 39:29.391
What is it you want me to tell you?
I don't know.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.388
We're not done here. Skyler.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.916
Do you know what
I've done for this family?

39:50.360 --> 39:51.839
What the--?

40:06.160 --> 40:10.153
-Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?
-What is wrong with you?

40:10.360 --> 40:12.749
Why are you blue? Jesus.

40:12.960 --> 40:16.236
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts
with my parents being greedy...

40:16.440 --> 40:20.069
-...kleptomaniac douche bags.
-Are you actually this stupid?

40:20.280 --> 40:21.998
No, look. I know this isn't a optimal--

40:22.200 --> 40:26.159
To come to my house and park
on my street, driving this vehicle.

40:26.360 --> 40:30.399
I mean, what the hell is wrong
with you? I'm really asking.

40:30.880 --> 40:33.440
-Nothing. I'm sorry. I just--
-What if Skyler had seen you?

40:33.640 --> 40:36.393
What then? What was the plan then,
genius, huh?

40:36.600 --> 40:38.830
-I don't know.
-You know why you don't know?

40:39.040 --> 40:41.110
Because you don't think. That's why.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.914
You don't think.
You never figured out how to think.

40:44.120 --> 40:47.635
I said I was sorry. I just need
my half of the money, and I will go.

40:48.800 --> 40:50.153
Your half?

40:50.360 --> 40:52.749
There is no your half of the money.

40:52.960 --> 40:55.394
There is only my all of it.
Do you understand?

40:55.600 --> 40:58.751
Why should I be penalised
because of your sloppiness?

40:58.960 --> 41:00.837
Look, that is completely uncool,
all right?

41:01.040 --> 41:02.758
We agreed, fifty-fifty partners.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.872
Partners in what?
What exactly do you do here?

41:06.080 --> 41:09.152
I've been meaning to ask,
because I'm the producer, right?

41:09.360 --> 41:13.399
I cook. But from what I can tell,
you are just a drug addict.

41:13.600 --> 41:18.594
You are a pathetic junkie,
too stupid to understand and follow...

41:18.800 --> 41:22.190
...simple rudimentary instructions.
Too stupid to re--

41:41.920 --> 41:43.399
Do it.

42:09.840 --> 42:13.799
Try not to touch anything.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.232
Want some breakfast?

43:30.305 --> 43:36.598
