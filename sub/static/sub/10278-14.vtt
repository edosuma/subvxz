E. R.

00:06.379 --> 00:07.918
Previously on E. R.

00:07.919 --> 00:09.375
How much of your brain
did they cut out?

00:09.376 --> 00:11.416
He has a mild expressive aphasia.

00:11.417 --> 00:12.938
- It's temporary.
- I don't like it.

00:12.939 --> 00:15.289
- This is just gonna be between us, right?
- Of course.

00:15.324 --> 00:17.377
The only reason you gave me that job
is because I'm black.

00:17.378 --> 00:18.529
Lupus is very serious.

00:18.530 --> 00:20.416
I know what it does, Dr. Kovac.

00:20.417 --> 00:21.829
I even know I'm gonna die from it.

00:21.864 --> 00:25.950
I need information about
evaluating a physician...

00:25.951 --> 00:29.688
...who's possibly cognitively impaired.

00:41.695 --> 00:44.612
E. R. 7x14 "A WALK IN THE WOODS"

00:44.781 --> 00:46.524
You asleep?

00:48.618 --> 00:50.029
Cleo?

00:51.955 --> 00:53.615
Cleo?

00:55.083 --> 00:56.992
You asleep?

01:01.965 --> 01:04.123
It's snowing outside.

01:05.677 --> 01:07.670
What time is it?

01:08.805 --> 01:10.798
Almost 6.

01:15.187 --> 01:17.643
You know, I was thinking...

01:19.066 --> 01:21.604
I have to be in at 7.

01:22.069 --> 01:25.153
The alarm's going off in 10 minutes.

01:26.991 --> 01:28.485
I'll be quick.

01:29.368 --> 01:31.824
The hell you will.

01:34.039 --> 01:37.159
- You feel it?
- No.

01:38.377 --> 01:40.666
There.

01:42.506 --> 01:47.085
It's really moving. How long
has she been going on like this?

01:47.261 --> 01:50.013
On and off all night.

01:52.475 --> 01:55.048
Go back to sleep.

01:57.021 --> 02:00.355
I keep thinking about that movie.

02:01.025 --> 02:04.145
Alien, you know?

02:04.821 --> 02:06.529
It's moving around under his skin...

02:06.698 --> 02:11.026
...and then, all of a sudden,
it breaks its way through with its teeth.

02:11.202 --> 02:15.911
Amanda, stop it.
You're scaring your mother.

02:16.124 --> 02:18.330
Amanda.

02:19.002 --> 02:21.707
So the baby's a girl today.

02:21.880 --> 02:26.672
Or Matthew, after my grandfather.
I can't decide.

02:29.346 --> 02:31.587
Last day?

02:32.891 --> 02:34.302
Last day.

02:42.442 --> 02:44.234
What?

02:48.240 --> 02:49.900
It's okay.

03:02.254 --> 03:03.998
Hi.

03:04.465 --> 03:07.086
Did I wake you?

03:07.593 --> 03:10.463
I was trying to let you sleep.

03:16.143 --> 03:19.263
I should probably get home anyway.

03:20.189 --> 03:23.309
You should bring a few things over.

03:24.402 --> 03:27.568
I could clear out
some closet space for you.

03:30.283 --> 03:34.280
- Are you sure you can spare it?
- I can find a couple of inches...

03:35.288 --> 03:37.743
...somewhere, maybe.

03:41.002 --> 03:43.374
I need to dry my hair.

03:56.518 --> 03:59.472
Are you gonna watch me again?

04:32.888 --> 04:35.509
Are you okay?

04:36.642 --> 04:38.765
And you?

04:50.364 --> 04:52.689
Penny for your thoughts.

04:53.784 --> 04:55.658
- Pardon?
- It means...

04:55.828 --> 04:58.698
It means,
"What are you thinking about? "

05:00.249 --> 05:02.372
Nothing, really.

05:08.007 --> 05:11.506
I was thinking about the bishop.

05:14.847 --> 05:19.260
Making love with me makes you
think of a priest with lupus?

05:30.154 --> 05:33.654
You watch me when we make love.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.446
You're beautiful.

05:53.094 --> 05:55.170
What was her name?

05:58.183 --> 06:00.010
Who?

06:02.979 --> 06:04.937
Your wife.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.061
Daniella.

06:16.118 --> 06:19.072
Did you love her very much?

06:20.664 --> 06:22.621
Yeah.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.876
I'm glad.

07:17.026 --> 07:19.547
E. R.

07:20.707 --> 07:23.376
Carter, 4-year-old boy's
coming in from preschool.

07:23.543 --> 07:25.785
Fever, trouble breathing.
Sixty-two's pulling in.

07:25.962 --> 07:27.540
Okey-dokey.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.541
Hey, Frank.
Is Dr. Greene here yet?

07:29.716 --> 07:31.508
No. Said he was coming in late.

07:31.677 --> 07:34.346
Weaver's upstairs at some
big administrative powwow.

07:34.513 --> 07:37.680
Probably suggesting the installation
of pay toilets in the bathrooms.

07:37.850 --> 07:38.881
Is Kovac here?

07:39.060 --> 07:41.266
He's got a dead shovel
they're trying to bring back.

07:41.437 --> 07:43.726
It's just you and me, then,
with this 4-year-old.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.440
I can take it.

07:45.608 --> 07:47.067
- Welcome back!
- Thanks.

07:47.235 --> 07:49.026
- How are you feeling?
- Pretty good.

07:49.195 --> 07:51.602
- Want me to tag along with you?
- No. I've got it.

07:51.781 --> 07:53.940
Eight weeks.
Could be some cobwebs.

07:54.118 --> 07:55.742
Thanks, anyway.

07:55.911 --> 07:58.782
- Call me if she gets into any trouble.
- Okay.

08:02.459 --> 08:03.491
You look great.

08:03.669 --> 08:05.377
I still have a few pounds to drop.

08:05.546 --> 08:07.752
- Can't tell.
- I should have gotten a coat.

08:07.923 --> 08:09.299
- Grab one.
- No, I'm all right.

08:09.466 --> 08:12.467
Zack Woodman, 4 years old.
Post grand mal seizure at preschool.

08:12.636 --> 08:15.923
We were finishing crafts, and
he started shaking and wet his pants.

08:16.099 --> 08:17.926
- You his mother?
- No. Preschool teacher.

08:18.101 --> 08:20.972
Feels like he's burning up.
BP's 100/60. Pulse, 120.

08:21.146 --> 08:23.933
- Does he have a history of epilepsy?
- Not that I know of.

08:24.107 --> 08:27.393
- Zack, open your eyes. Zack-
- Excuse me. Can somebody help me?

08:27.569 --> 08:29.776
- Are you hurt?
- It's not me. He's in the car.

08:29.947 --> 08:32.520
He's very weak.
I don't think he can walk on his own.

08:32.698 --> 08:33.813
Abby?

08:33.991 --> 08:35.985
- What's wrong?
- He's having trouble breathing.

08:36.162 --> 08:37.573
- Has he been ill?
- Yes.

08:37.746 --> 08:38.826
When did this start?

08:38.998 --> 08:41.668
I don't know.
A couple hours ago, I guess.

08:43.837 --> 08:46.588
- Hi.
- Hello.

08:46.798 --> 08:50.463
- Can you walk?
- I don't think so.

08:52.971 --> 08:56.885
I need a septic workup, CBC, blood
and urine cultures, chest x-ray.

08:57.058 --> 08:58.684
- Temp's 105.
- Sorry.

08:58.853 --> 09:01.426
- The bishop's back.
- I need a weight.

09:02.899 --> 09:04.773
Blue zone, 20 kilos.

09:04.942 --> 09:07.315
360 milligrams of rectal Tylenol.

09:07.487 --> 09:10.523
- Pulse ox, 82.
- Put him on a mask, 10 liters.

09:10.698 --> 09:12.656
Do you want to do a spinal tap?

09:13.117 --> 09:14.446
He could have meningitis.

09:14.619 --> 09:16.659
Or a febrile seizure,
and he's gonna wake up.

09:16.830 --> 09:19.666
- Why don't I get an LP tray?
- I want to wait a few minutes.

09:19.834 --> 09:23.333
Give 900 of cefotaxime
after the cultures.

09:29.677 --> 09:33.128
Well, I love what you've done
with the place. Very Teutonic.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.097
No trappings of success
to interfere...

09:35.266 --> 09:37.472
...with your performing
your new duties.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.138
I requisitioned some furniture...

09:39.312 --> 09:41.982
...but the form's on your desk
waiting for your signature.

09:42.149 --> 09:45.316
Well, you should see my in-box.
Must be 18 inches deep.

09:45.486 --> 09:47.146
- Are those admissions folders?
- Yeah.

09:47.321 --> 09:49.777
I thought I'd familiarize
myself with them.

09:49.949 --> 09:51.443
Don't bother. Kids are gonna toss out...

09:51.617 --> 09:54.190
clichÃ©s about wanting to help people.

09:54.370 --> 09:57.869
You could ask their favorite color,
or if they like cheese. Doesn't matter.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.914
Step outside a minute, would you?

10:09.011 --> 10:11.762
He showed up whining
about not getting an interview.

10:11.930 --> 10:15.299
You should shake his hand,
since this falls under your purview...

10:15.476 --> 10:18.560
...before you have Security
toss him out.

10:19.730 --> 10:21.888
Hey. That's your man.

10:22.066 --> 10:25.317
- Dean Benton?
- Dr. Benton.

10:25.528 --> 10:28.150
William White.
Thanks for finding time to see me.

10:28.323 --> 10:31.028
Yeah. Well, what can I do for you?

10:31.201 --> 10:33.656
I got this letter.
I applied to the medical school.

10:33.829 --> 10:35.406
But I didn't get an interview.

10:36.832 --> 10:38.871
Teacher doesn't have a signed
emergency consent form.

10:39.042 --> 10:40.786
- He's still not waking up.
- How long?

10:40.961 --> 10:44.377
- Forty minutes.
- Zack? Zack, can you hear me?

10:44.548 --> 10:47.585
- He needs an LP.
- We don't have parental consent.

10:47.760 --> 10:50.298
Get another doc
to sign off the chart with you.

10:50.471 --> 10:52.511
Okay. Get the tray set up.

10:53.308 --> 10:57.934
- Frank, where's Carter?
- In 4. Granny took a fall.

11:00.815 --> 11:02.855
Can I see you for a moment?

11:03.026 --> 11:04.141
Sure.

11:06.446 --> 11:08.819
I've got that 4-year-old
with febrile seizure.

11:08.991 --> 11:11.031
He's still altered.
I wanna do a spinal tap.

11:11.202 --> 11:13.527
The preschool doesn't have
an emergency consent.

11:13.704 --> 11:15.448
Haven't been able
to contact a parent.

11:15.623 --> 11:18.707
- Any other signs?
- X-ray looks like viral pneumonia.

11:18.876 --> 11:21.628
I can't assess for a stiff neck,
but there is photophobia.

11:21.796 --> 11:23.255
Where do you want me to sign?

11:23.423 --> 11:26.210
Oxygen saturation's only 78.

11:26.551 --> 11:29.043
- What should it be?
- Hundred.

11:29.346 --> 11:31.588
Seventy-eight sounds
like a passing grade.

11:31.765 --> 11:33.046
Barely.

11:33.559 --> 11:34.970
Put him up to four liters.

11:35.144 --> 11:38.976
CBC, blood cultures, ABG,
sed rate and a portable chest.

11:39.148 --> 11:41.686
Hang a gram of cefotaxime
in case it's pneumonia.

11:41.942 --> 11:45.109
Pneumonia? I don't
even feel like I have a fever.

11:45.446 --> 11:48.862
The steroids prevent you
from having fevers.

11:49.033 --> 11:52.035
And push 125 of Solu-Medrol.

11:52.204 --> 11:53.995
You're giving me more steroids?

11:54.164 --> 11:58.328
You could have a flare of the lupus
with inflammation in the lung.

11:58.502 --> 12:01.207
There's also a chance
that you are throwing blood clots.

12:01.380 --> 12:05.128
Lupus makes your blood
coagulate more easily.

12:06.093 --> 12:09.213
Have you called your own doctor?

12:10.472 --> 12:11.754
No.

12:11.933 --> 12:13.558
- I'll call him.
- No.

12:15.103 --> 12:18.353
Why? Because you think
I'm easier to manipulate?

12:19.524 --> 12:24.186
I'm not nearly as Machiavellian
as you imagine me to be.

12:24.780 --> 12:27.864
I came here
because I prefer your care.

12:32.955 --> 12:33.987
How's it going?

12:34.165 --> 12:37.119
Easy tap when they're unconscious.
Looks pretty clear.

12:37.293 --> 12:39.001
- Cute kid. What's his name?
- Zack.

12:39.170 --> 12:41.792
Cell count, glucose, protein,
Gram's stain and culture.

12:41.965 --> 12:45.250
He's got those shoes that light up
when you walk. How do they do that?

12:45.427 --> 12:48.214
- Want to roll him back over?
- What is that?

12:48.888 --> 12:51.380
- What?
- That.

12:52.392 --> 12:54.765
You didn't tell me
he had a macular rash.

12:54.937 --> 12:57.144
It wasn't there half an hour ago.

12:57.398 --> 13:00.233
- It must be a viral exanthem.
- It could be measles.

13:00.401 --> 13:02.643
- Measles?
- Yeah.

13:02.820 --> 13:04.730
Fever, altered mental status,
pneumonia.

13:04.906 --> 13:07.064
More likely,
he has a virus with pneumonia...

13:07.241 --> 13:10.278
...and had a febrile seizure
from the high temperature.

13:10.578 --> 13:12.903
That is a classic measles rash.

13:13.206 --> 13:15.080
Abby, can you hand me
a tongue depressor?

13:15.667 --> 13:17.411
- Have you ever seen measles?
- No. You?

13:17.586 --> 13:19.745
Of course not.
Nobody's seen measles.

13:19.922 --> 13:21.464
Can you...?

13:23.926 --> 13:26.797
He's got Koplik spots
on the buccal mucosa.

13:26.971 --> 13:28.430
What?

13:28.764 --> 13:31.302
Or he bit the inside of his mouth
when he was seizing.

13:31.475 --> 13:34.346
There's a Nelson's in the lounge.
Can you grab it, please?

13:34.520 --> 13:35.931
Now.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.477
- Is Zack all right?
- This is Mrs. Woodman.

13:42.654 --> 13:46.106
I was in court. I have to turn off
my cell in session. My God!

13:46.283 --> 13:49.486
I'm Dr. Chen. Your son had a seizure
and a high temperature.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.283
We've done a spinal tap
to rule out meningitis.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.745
- Are Zack's immunizations up-to-date?
- No.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.080
Has he had the MMR?

13:56.252 --> 13:59.669
He hasn't had any immunizations.
None of our children have.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.797
- I got it.
- Abby, put a mask on Zack.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.627
What's the matter?

14:04.136 --> 14:06.627
- What's happening?
- Get him into the Laminar Flow Room.

14:06.805 --> 14:09.474
Call the school.
Don't let anybody leave.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.427
What's the matter with my son?

14:11.602 --> 14:14.306
- Your son has measles.
- That's not too bad, right?

14:14.479 --> 14:17.564
One in 500 kids die from measles.

14:19.777 --> 14:21.854
Frank, I'm taking
the Luiz kid up now.

14:22.030 --> 14:25.399
Please send along the films
when you find them again, will you?

14:25.575 --> 14:26.986
Yes, ma'am.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.449
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:29.621 --> 14:31.660
- So how'd it go?
- Fine.

14:31.831 --> 14:33.409
Fine? That's it?

14:33.583 --> 14:35.291
I laid down, they shot...

14:35.460 --> 14:38.295
a couple billion more rads
into my skull, and then I left.

14:38.463 --> 14:39.922
And that's it.

14:40.090 --> 14:42.463
Hopefully, my irradiated head
won't screw up...

14:42.635 --> 14:46.300
...any navigational equipment
on our next flight.

14:53.271 --> 14:55.228
All right, all right.

14:58.193 --> 15:00.066
I have to go.

15:00.236 --> 15:03.522
- Lunch?
- If I can. Come find me.

15:03.698 --> 15:05.028
Okay.

15:06.952 --> 15:09.360
So did I hear right? You're done?

15:09.538 --> 15:12.623
Radiation treatment. Just two
more weeks of immune therapy.

15:12.792 --> 15:13.823
- Dr. Greene?
- Yeah?

15:14.001 --> 15:16.290
That's great. Did they
give you the tumor back?

15:16.462 --> 15:19.084
When they took it out,
did they give it back to you?

15:19.257 --> 15:22.756
Because my uncle Al,
he's got his on a mantle in a jar.

15:22.927 --> 15:25.216
Guy over there wants to talk to you.

15:25.389 --> 15:29.221
You know, Dave, I don't really
want a tumor on my mantle.

15:30.686 --> 15:32.180
Hi. Dr. Greene. Can I help you?

15:32.354 --> 15:35.024
Robert Wilson. Is there
some place we could talk?

15:35.190 --> 15:38.310
- Actually, I'm on duty.
- It'd be better if we had some privacy.

15:38.486 --> 15:40.644
- I'm sorry, Mr...
- Dr. Wilson.

15:40.821 --> 15:43.739
Dr. Wilson. What is it?

15:43.908 --> 15:46.481
I work for the Illinois Department
of Professional Regulation.

15:46.827 --> 15:49.663
We've been asked
to evaluate your competency...

15:49.831 --> 15:52.405
...to continue practicing medicine.

15:52.584 --> 15:55.585
- Where in the hell did he catch measles?
- Europe, I think.

15:55.754 --> 15:58.541
Mom was in Paris two weeks ago,
took the whole family.

15:58.715 --> 16:01.966
She some fringe lunatic thinks
immunizations are a conspiracy...

16:02.136 --> 16:04.175
...between doctors
and drug companies?

16:04.346 --> 16:05.461
I don't think so.

16:05.681 --> 16:07.923
Find out if there are
other kids at home...

16:08.100 --> 16:11.681
...where the child's been, who he's
had contact with over the last week.

16:18.528 --> 16:20.521
How is he?
They won't let me back there.

16:20.697 --> 16:23.318
We moved him to a room
with special ventilation...

16:23.492 --> 16:26.113
...so he doesn't contaminate
the rest of the ER.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.528
- Is he awake?
- He's still unconscious.

16:28.705 --> 16:32.538
He has pneumonia.
And, in all likelihood, encephalitis.

16:32.710 --> 16:35.036
- What's that?
- Inflammation around the brain.

16:35.213 --> 16:38.297
- Did you call the preschool?
- Yes. All the children are there.

16:38.466 --> 16:40.210
Make sure they've all
been immunized.

16:40.385 --> 16:43.920
Their parents, their siblings,
anyone they've been in contact with.

16:44.097 --> 16:47.715
There's a phone at the desk. Tell Frank
that Dr. Carter said you could use it.

16:47.892 --> 16:49.387
Please.

16:51.814 --> 16:53.142
You have other children?

16:53.316 --> 16:56.067
A daughter. I called my husband.
He's coming with her.

16:56.235 --> 16:58.940
And she hasn't been
immunized either?

16:59.405 --> 17:02.359
No. Is Zack gonna be okay?

17:02.784 --> 17:06.733
Well, he's in grave condition
with a highly contagious disease.

17:07.413 --> 17:09.073
I'm not an irresponsible parent.

17:09.248 --> 17:12.367
I read all the literature on the Internet,
the parenting magazines.

17:12.542 --> 17:15.913
- I discussed it with my pediatrician.
- He didn't recommend the MMR?

17:16.089 --> 17:19.375
Zack's immune system could have
been weakened from vaccinations.

17:19.551 --> 17:22.469
The immune system
is strengthened by vaccines.

17:23.055 --> 17:26.424
- Kids are exposed to foreign antigens.
- Vaccines aren't completely safe.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.473
- I'm sorry-
- They aren't, and you know it.

17:28.644 --> 17:30.637
The connection between
vaccinations and autism-

17:30.813 --> 17:32.604
There is no connection.

17:32.773 --> 17:35.182
Dr. Carter, Zack dropped his sats.

17:36.445 --> 17:39.114
He's at 75 at 100 percent.

17:39.615 --> 17:43.066
He's getting cyanotic.
I've already started the atropine.

17:43.202 --> 17:46.867
Etomidate and sux. I need a 5-0 uncuffed
ET and a number 2 curved blade.

17:47.039 --> 17:48.070
What's going on?

17:48.248 --> 17:51.415
There's so much lung damage that
oxygen can't get into his bloodstream.

17:51.585 --> 17:54.788
- What are you doing?
- Trying to get him more oxygen.

17:54.964 --> 17:56.293
He needs a machine to breathe?

17:56.466 --> 17:58.126
If we don't intubate him,
he's gonna die.

17:58.301 --> 17:59.760
- I'll do it.
- I got it.

17:59.928 --> 18:01.636
Not on your first day back.
Step out.

18:01.805 --> 18:03.844
- What?
- Step out! Give me some suction.

18:04.015 --> 18:05.889
- He's throwing PVCs.
- Oh, my God!

18:17.321 --> 18:18.650
Come on.

18:20.450 --> 18:23.155
- Okay, I got it.
- Good breath sounds bilaterally.

18:23.328 --> 18:24.359
Pulse ox up to 88.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.826
Tidal volume of 150, AC of 14.

18:26.998 --> 18:29.620
Let's keep him on 100 percent
with three of PEEP.

18:30.168 --> 18:33.003
- He's okay now?
- Yeah, sure. He's great.

18:33.838 --> 18:35.546
Is that the bishop's?

18:36.132 --> 18:40.083
- He says he's feeling better.
- The oxygen and the medication.

18:40.263 --> 18:43.632
So he'll be able to perform
the ordination this afternoon?

18:43.891 --> 18:44.923
What?

18:45.101 --> 18:47.093
That's where we were headed
when he became ill in the car.

18:47.270 --> 18:49.179
A kid that he baptized
at his first parish...

18:49.355 --> 18:52.273
...is being ordained as a priest today.

18:56.279 --> 18:58.070
Where do you think you're going?

18:58.239 --> 18:59.437
I feel much better.

18:59.616 --> 19:02.190
Your ABG shows
an oxygen level of 58.

19:02.369 --> 19:04.943
And your sed rate is 84.

19:05.122 --> 19:06.581
Eighty-four. Is that good?

19:06.749 --> 19:10.034
No, it's not good!
It's an indication of active lupus!

19:10.628 --> 19:13.463
Stop buttoning that damn shirt.

19:13.631 --> 19:17.379
Is Joe still outside? I think I'm gonna
need help getting into these pants.

19:17.551 --> 19:22.048
You need to be admitted
to the ICU for IV Cytoxan.

19:22.223 --> 19:23.552
Only a couple of hours.

19:23.725 --> 19:26.098
If the inflammation
in your lungs continues...

19:26.270 --> 19:28.476
...you won't get enough oxygen
to stay alive.

19:28.647 --> 19:30.889
If I skip the reception,
I can be back here by 6.

19:31.066 --> 19:33.142
You'll be dead by 6!

19:35.613 --> 19:39.231
- It's in God's hands.
- God could give a damn!

19:47.584 --> 19:50.075
Is there something I should sign...

19:50.253 --> 19:52.127
...so I can go?

19:52.631 --> 19:56.331
- You're kidding! Stephanie?
- She just up and moved to Seattle.

19:56.510 --> 19:59.546
- I thought she was living with Deborah.
- No. She met a stewardess.

19:59.721 --> 20:02.259
Another stewardess!

20:03.392 --> 20:06.726
Hey, we were just looking for you.
This is Christy.

20:06.896 --> 20:08.556
Christy, Kerry.

20:08.732 --> 20:10.558
- Hi.
- Hello.

20:10.734 --> 20:14.945
- Christy and I were having coffee.
- I insisted that she bring me here.

20:15.113 --> 20:18.564
I'm sorry, but a bunch of us were
beginning to question your existence.

20:18.742 --> 20:21.280
We were thinking about having
dinner tonight. You game?

20:21.453 --> 20:23.778
I can't get off in time.
But thank you for asking.

20:23.955 --> 20:25.829
I checked your schedule.
You get off at 6.

20:25.999 --> 20:28.242
Don't worry. Nobody bites.

20:28.419 --> 20:32.631
Chief, can I get you to sign off
on this LOL? Head CT's clear.

20:34.717 --> 20:36.793
-7:30?
- Okay.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.757
- Great. We'll see you then.
- Bye.

20:41.224 --> 20:44.675
That Legaspi's girlfriend?
I heard she's gay.

20:44.853 --> 20:45.967
I don't know.

20:46.146 --> 20:49.563
What I wouldn't pay to drop in
on that little party, huh?

20:52.862 --> 20:54.486
You turned me in?

20:54.655 --> 20:57.063
A guy from the medical board's
questioning my competency.

20:57.241 --> 20:58.272
- Don't walk away!
- I'm not.

20:58.551 --> 21:00.599
I don't wanna have this
conversation in the lobby.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.487
He wants to see my medical records.

21:02.663 --> 21:06.412
He's planning on interviewing the staff
to see if I'm fit to practice medicine.

21:06.584 --> 21:07.829
He can pull my license!

21:08.002 --> 21:11.004
I'm concerned about your personality
changes since the surgery.

21:11.173 --> 21:13.664
I tried to talk to you,
but you've chosen to ignore me.

21:13.842 --> 21:17.258
- So you call in the licensing board-?
- Keep your voice down.

21:17.429 --> 21:19.588
They cut a tumor out of my head.

21:19.765 --> 21:22.517
I'm sorry if I seem
a little different to you.

21:22.685 --> 21:25.140
I wouldn't come back to work
if I couldn't do the job.

21:25.312 --> 21:27.305
- What about the aphasia?
- It's getting better.

21:27.481 --> 21:31.016
If you couldn't think of the name
of the drug you wanted ordered...

21:31.193 --> 21:33.685
...the nurses ask questions
while the patient dies?

21:33.905 --> 21:36.479
- Nobody's dying!
- You've been insensitive and argumentative.

21:36.658 --> 21:39.030
- I have not!
- You have been shooting from the hip.

21:39.202 --> 21:42.369
I'm not the only one
who's expressed concern.

21:42.539 --> 21:44.247
For the safety of the patients...

21:44.416 --> 21:47.702
...I felt I had to call the board
for an objective assessment.

21:47.878 --> 21:50.369
I want you to pass,
so we can all get back to work...

21:50.547 --> 21:53.668
...confident in your abilities. Okay?

21:53.843 --> 21:57.212
Rich people think if poor kids are
immunized, then they don't have to be.

21:57.389 --> 21:58.847
I thought it stopped snowing.

21:59.015 --> 22:00.889
If everybody stops
getting vaccines...

22:01.059 --> 22:04.594
...then smallpox will be back,
polio, measles.

22:04.771 --> 22:06.100
Then they'll be lined up begging us...

22:06.273 --> 22:09.108
to stick a needle into little Annie's arm.

22:09.276 --> 22:10.900
Fifty-year-old male
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

22:11.069 --> 22:13.358
Persistent nausea and vomiting
despite Compazine.

22:13.530 --> 22:15.405
BP's 88/58. Pulse, 130.

22:15.575 --> 22:18.280
Mucous membranes very dry.
Gave a liter of saline en route.

22:18.453 --> 22:21.407
He only finished the chemotherapy
last week. Is the cancer back?

22:21.581 --> 22:24.037
No. He's probably having
a reaction to the chemo.

22:24.209 --> 22:25.407
- How's the boy?
- Which one?

22:25.585 --> 22:27.376
The kid with the febrile seizure.

22:27.545 --> 22:29.289
- You brought him in?
- Couple hours ago.

22:29.464 --> 22:30.792
- They didn't call you?
- About?

22:30.965 --> 22:34.548
Measles. You drove an immunosuppressed
patient in the same rig?

22:34.719 --> 22:36.629
- What does that mean?
- Nobody told us!

22:36.806 --> 22:38.763
I'll need a CBC and a Chem-20.

22:38.933 --> 22:40.427
Watch your step.

23:14.345 --> 23:15.720
Excuse me.

23:15.888 --> 23:19.091
I need to review a file of an applicant
who wasn't given an interview.

23:19.268 --> 23:20.299
And you are?

23:20.477 --> 23:22.683
Peter Benton.
I'm the new director of diversity.

23:22.854 --> 23:25.690
- Lucky you. This year?
- Yeah.

23:25.858 --> 23:28.313
It'd be in the reject pile.
What's the name?

23:28.485 --> 23:30.608
White. William White.

23:30.779 --> 23:34.824
We had over 3000 applications
for 150 spots.

23:34.992 --> 23:36.652
Big pile.

23:37.828 --> 23:40.034
Director of diversity, huh?

23:40.581 --> 23:44.117
That position's a little quixotic
around here these days.

23:44.336 --> 23:48.796
My David wouldn't be with Morgan
Stanley without affirmative action.

23:49.341 --> 23:51.333
William Jackson White.

23:51.510 --> 23:53.383
Thank you.

24:05.650 --> 24:09.019
Excuse me. Do you keep files of
past candidates that were accepted?

24:09.195 --> 24:10.358
I need to compare them.

24:10.530 --> 24:13.946
Compare to last year's acceptances.
They're over there by graduating year.

24:14.117 --> 24:16.608
2004 is on the right.

24:16.786 --> 24:18.411
Student Affairs.

24:18.747 --> 24:20.241
Fax it over.

24:21.833 --> 24:23.874
I'll be looking for it.

24:31.969 --> 24:33.713
Student Affairs.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.532
What are you doing out here?

25:02.043 --> 25:04.249
Just getting some air.

25:05.046 --> 25:06.754
What's the matter?

25:08.759 --> 25:12.839
- How's your bishop?
- He just left.

25:13.013 --> 25:14.673
That's good, right?

25:14.848 --> 25:19.641
He's having an acute lupus flare.
He left AMA.

25:20.771 --> 25:22.728
So go get him.

25:22.898 --> 25:25.472
Take some oxygen,
make sure he's okay.

25:25.651 --> 25:29.068
He knew what he was doing.
I'm not his keeper.

25:36.955 --> 25:39.790
- So this is you, huh?
- Yep.

25:39.958 --> 25:43.043
Could use a little something.
What is that back there?

25:43.211 --> 25:45.703
My room with a view.
Cafeteria kitchen.

25:45.881 --> 25:49.879
Vending machine only had
turkey and egg salad. No veggie.

25:51.721 --> 25:53.132
Thank you.

25:53.306 --> 25:55.465
Hear about our measles kid downstairs?

25:55.642 --> 25:58.311
Four years old, parents didn't vaccinate.

25:58.645 --> 26:02.228
- What's all this?
- Med school applications.

26:02.399 --> 26:04.806
Thinking about starting over?

26:06.653 --> 26:08.480
Is this your file?

26:08.822 --> 26:11.147
This black kid applied
and didn't get an interview.

26:11.324 --> 26:14.196
I went to Records to find out why
and found that.

26:14.370 --> 26:17.822
- Yeah? Anything interesting?
- Yeah. My file wasn't with the rest.

26:17.999 --> 26:22.044
It was in the back with three
others filed under AA.

26:22.211 --> 26:24.038
Affirmative Action.

26:24.213 --> 26:27.333
- That surprised you?
- Hell, yeah!

26:27.509 --> 26:31.209
Look, my grades were good.
My MCAT scores were competitive.

26:34.392 --> 26:37.677
Yeah, but when I compared it
to the other applicants...

26:37.853 --> 26:40.605
...that were accepted that year,
I shouldn't have gotten in.

26:40.773 --> 26:43.691
You're an excellent physician.
They were right to let you in.

26:43.859 --> 26:45.270
Yeah?

26:45.695 --> 26:48.861
This is the kid's file that didn't
even get an interview this year.

26:49.031 --> 26:50.194
William White.

26:50.366 --> 26:53.652
His grades, his MCAT scores,
they're better than mine were.

27:53.475 --> 27:55.432
Bishop Stewart?

27:58.814 --> 28:00.225
Damn it!

28:04.612 --> 28:06.735
I'm okay.

28:06.990 --> 28:09.944
How long have you been
having trouble breathing?

28:10.118 --> 28:13.238
I'm just gathering my strength.

28:14.289 --> 28:17.206
You have to go to the hospital.

28:17.751 --> 28:21.286
It's pretty, isn't it?

28:21.589 --> 28:23.213
The snow.

28:23.758 --> 28:25.797
So much beauty.

28:25.968 --> 28:28.008
Where's the phone?
I need to call an ambulance.

28:28.179 --> 28:31.548
No. Please, I only need a minute.

28:31.724 --> 28:33.717
You're dying.

28:34.143 --> 28:36.551
Evidently.

28:38.690 --> 28:44.147
As I was sitting here, I was reminded
of the night I chose to become a priest.

28:44.613 --> 28:48.860
I'd been struggling with it
for a long time.

28:49.076 --> 28:51.235
Several years.

28:52.329 --> 28:56.623
Anyway, that night, I couldn't sleep.

28:56.792 --> 29:02.035
So I got up
and went out for a walk...

29:03.215 --> 29:07.345
...in the woods
behind my father's house.

29:08.597 --> 29:14.054
It was snowing like it is now.
I don't have any idea how long I walked.

29:14.228 --> 29:19.453
At a certain point, I suddenly realized
I didn't know which way to go.

29:21.026 --> 29:25.154
I'd gotten lost. I was frightened.

29:25.657 --> 29:29.358
As I looked up
into that dark night...

29:30.537 --> 29:32.695
...he came to me.

29:32.873 --> 29:38.792
I saw all those millions of snowflakes
drifting down toward me.

29:39.546 --> 29:41.704
So still.

29:43.467 --> 29:45.459
So peaceful.

29:46.511 --> 29:48.304
Perfect.

29:48.473 --> 29:53.051
And I was filled with the love
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

29:55.563 --> 30:00.938
Like pouring wine
into an empty glass.

30:04.739 --> 30:06.898
I'm afraid...

30:07.909 --> 30:11.030
...I may have wasted my life.

30:12.623 --> 30:16.953
For some reason, I never
accomplished the things I should have.

30:18.921 --> 30:21.757
What God wanted of me.

30:25.428 --> 30:28.001
And now I'm frightened.

30:40.444 --> 30:43.445
I'm afraid of dying.

30:47.660 --> 30:51.325
There. I said it.

30:53.959 --> 30:57.577
I am afraid to die.

30:57.755 --> 30:59.463
You have to go to the hospital.

30:59.631 --> 31:03.878
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

31:04.219 --> 31:07.256
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

31:07.431 --> 31:09.471
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

31:09.642 --> 31:10.922
Is he all right?

31:11.101 --> 31:13.095
- No.
- Yes.

31:14.356 --> 31:16.728
The procession is forming.

31:16.900 --> 31:19.356
What should I tell them?

31:22.864 --> 31:24.656
Tell them...

31:28.328 --> 31:31.578
...I think I have to skip
the processional.

31:36.129 --> 31:38.537
When did you lose your faith?

31:38.715 --> 31:43.507
I've found with most people,
it comes and goes.

31:43.845 --> 31:47.759
Like intimacy in a relationship.

31:47.933 --> 31:53.853
Sometimes it's so strong,
a passion, rapture.

31:54.689 --> 32:00.610
And then at other times
it's impossible, distant, lost.

32:03.324 --> 32:07.536
But that's not God. That's us.

32:08.621 --> 32:13.532
We put up our own barriers
with our egos...

32:14.794 --> 32:17.464
...and our pain.

32:21.886 --> 32:24.424
He's always there.

32:25.056 --> 32:27.297
No matter what.

32:30.519 --> 32:32.393
Bach.

32:33.231 --> 32:35.603
I love Bach.

32:40.239 --> 32:41.899
Well...

32:42.658 --> 32:45.113
...that's my cue.

33:15.692 --> 33:19.192
So, Kevin, why do you
want to be a doctor?

33:19.363 --> 33:21.569
I've given that question
a great deal of thought.

33:21.740 --> 33:24.695
I think it all boils down to one thing:

33:24.869 --> 33:26.779
I really want to help people.

33:26.955 --> 33:29.078
My dad died of lung cancer...

33:29.249 --> 33:31.574
...and I was 12.
I vowed I would work for a cure.

33:31.751 --> 33:35.203
My research in molecular biology
has been very rewarding.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.289
We'll see gene therapy
in our lifetime.

33:38.091 --> 33:39.254
I'm a people person.

33:39.426 --> 33:41.419
The bottom line is,
I really want to help people.

33:41.595 --> 33:44.383
I volunteered for the Pediatrics ward.
I'm very empathetic.

33:44.557 --> 33:49.764
When I saw my kitty suffering like that,
I knew that I had a calling.

33:49.938 --> 33:51.598
To help people in their time of need.

33:51.773 --> 33:53.564
You have to combine
humanistic skills-

33:53.733 --> 33:55.773
With a passion
for making a difference.

33:55.944 --> 33:57.438
I really just wanna help people.

33:57.612 --> 33:59.605
- I just wanna help people.
- I wanna help people.

34:00.865 --> 34:02.941
Help people.

34:04.953 --> 34:08.737
How dare you? Damn it, Kerry!
They sawed off half his skull.

34:08.916 --> 34:12.498
They inserted high-dosage chemotherapy
wafers into the empty cavity.

34:12.670 --> 34:15.078
It caused temporary swelling
right next to Broca's.

34:15.255 --> 34:18.292
Of course he had a little aphasia.
But that was six weeks ago.

34:18.467 --> 34:21.385
The swelling's gone down,
and he's back to normal.

34:21.554 --> 34:24.092
If anything, I find his honesty
rather refreshing.

34:24.264 --> 34:26.139
We could all do
with more candor here.

34:26.309 --> 34:30.355
Candidly speaking then, are you sure
that you can be objective about this?

34:30.522 --> 34:33.523
Of course I'm not objective!

34:33.692 --> 34:36.230
I've been with him every moment,
and I can tell you...

34:36.402 --> 34:39.321
...he's making remarkable progress
and is no danger to anyone.

34:39.489 --> 34:42.824
Except perhaps easily threatened,
minor demigods.

34:42.993 --> 34:44.737
He may be endangering patients.

34:44.911 --> 34:47.154
I'm not unsympathetic
to his circumstances...

34:47.331 --> 34:50.002
...but I have larger responsibilities.

34:50.168 --> 34:53.418
It's despicable, and you
should be ashamed of yourself.

34:53.589 --> 34:56.672
I hope that you end up with a
possibly fatal illness one day...

34:56.842 --> 35:00.377
...so that I can do absolutely
nothing to help you.

35:04.725 --> 35:06.433
What was that about?

35:06.602 --> 35:08.678
Some days I really hate this job.

35:08.854 --> 35:12.853
Well, you, me and everyone else
around here. Are you ready?

35:13.485 --> 35:14.944
- Dinner?
- Right.

35:15.111 --> 35:17.603
Yes. I just have to drop this off.

35:17.781 --> 35:20.817
- You still got that leg lac in Sutures.
- I'm on it.

35:20.992 --> 35:24.611
- Get there by Easter, would you, please?!
- Yeah, yeah.

35:28.583 --> 35:30.208
- Hey, Malik?
- Yeah?

35:30.377 --> 35:32.536
Is this the measles kid's
post-intubation film?

35:32.714 --> 35:34.505
Why didn't it go
to the PICU with him?

35:34.674 --> 35:36.299
- I'll take it up.
- No, I'll do it.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.460
I want to check on him anyway.

35:40.054 --> 35:43.424
Phi Beta Kappa, Yale.
GPA's 3.95.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.639
MCATs in the 97th percentile.

35:45.810 --> 35:49.014
- Yeah, sure.
- Peter?

35:50.106 --> 35:54.354
And Carpenter.
University of Georgia.

35:54.529 --> 35:59.107
Was this the geek in the Smashing
Pumpkins T-shirt, with the lisp?

35:59.283 --> 36:02.902
- Sarah. Redhead, glasses.
- Yeah. Right.

36:04.914 --> 36:08.497
GPA, 3.79. Ninety-fourth
percentile on the MCATs.

36:08.668 --> 36:12.452
- Finalist for the Falsberg Science Award.
- Whatever that is. We've got better.

36:12.630 --> 36:14.041
Peter?

36:15.092 --> 36:16.586
No.

36:17.136 --> 36:21.299
That's it. We are recommending two
to the full committee, rejecting 14.

36:21.474 --> 36:24.344
Great. I still might make it home
in time for SportsCenter.

36:24.518 --> 36:27.436
There is another candidate
I'd like to discuss.

36:28.522 --> 36:31.607
- William White.
- Who?

36:31.776 --> 36:33.982
His MCAT scores were
only in the 91st percentile...

36:34.153 --> 36:37.819
...but his GPA was 3.80,
and he was class president.

36:37.991 --> 36:40.945
- I don't see him on the list.
- We didn't grant him an interview.

36:41.120 --> 36:44.405
I met with him today. He asked me
to reconsider his application.

36:44.581 --> 36:48.496
Oh, no. Is this that whiner
I told you to get rid of?

36:48.669 --> 36:51.456
- Where did he go to school?
- University of Illinois, Chicago.

36:51.630 --> 36:54.086
My gardener could have gotten
a 3.8 at the U of I...

36:54.258 --> 36:56.464
...and his head was run over
by a truck as a kid.

36:56.635 --> 36:58.463
I went to the University of Illinois.

36:58.638 --> 37:00.964
His MCATs are well below
our admission standards.

37:01.141 --> 37:03.466
MCATs don't predict
how good a doctor you'll be.

37:03.643 --> 37:05.766
Just what you do
the first years of school.

37:05.937 --> 37:08.974
- This kid is bright. He's dedicated-
- He's black.

37:09.149 --> 37:11.984
- Yeah, he's black.
- Affirmative action's against the law.

37:12.152 --> 37:15.272
We didn't interview one black
or Latino candidate today.

37:15.447 --> 37:18.816
We have a colorblind policy. If he was
good enough, he would've been here.

37:18.992 --> 37:21.829
Minority kids don't have the same
access to academic opportunities.

37:21.996 --> 37:23.325
You want to address that...

37:23.498 --> 37:27.543
...by advancing underqualified applicants
at the expense of our integrity and theirs?

37:27.711 --> 37:29.952
I want him to have an interview.

38:11.799 --> 38:13.377
Clear.

38:15.219 --> 38:17.176
- Still V-fib.
- What happened?

38:17.346 --> 38:19.220
Hypoxia, bradyed down to 20,
then he arrested.

38:19.390 --> 38:21.015
- Another round of epi.
- He's on PEEP?

38:21.184 --> 38:24.933
Maxed out, and his PO-2's
only 39 on 100 percent oxygen.

38:25.105 --> 38:27.347
- Charge to 50.
- Clear!

38:29.693 --> 38:30.724
Asystole.

38:30.903 --> 38:33.987
- How long has he been down?
- Forty minutes.

38:34.156 --> 38:35.650
He's had two rounds of atropine?

38:35.824 --> 38:40.652
Lidocaine, amiodarone and dopamine.
You got any other ideas?

38:41.247 --> 38:43.120
Hold compressions.

39:23.125 --> 39:27.288
Vicki is dating guys now,
and Carol is getting married to one.

39:27.462 --> 39:28.792
Both of these women marched...

39:28.965 --> 39:32.132
in every gay-pride parade
for the past 15 years.

39:32.302 --> 39:33.760
- I don't get it.
- I do.

39:33.928 --> 39:36.336
You get society's blessing,
your family's-

39:36.514 --> 39:38.839
Survivor benefits, tax breaks.

39:39.017 --> 39:42.018
And all you gotta do
is lay there a few times a week.

39:45.774 --> 39:48.347
I'm sorry.
We're not usually this bad.

39:48.526 --> 39:50.816
- It's okay.
- Hey...

39:50.988 --> 39:55.282
...do you realize that everyone
at this table has slept with Kim?

39:55.451 --> 39:58.487
- Oh, my God!
- Cut it out, you guys.

39:58.663 --> 40:02.114
I bet she brought a U-Haul
on your second date, right?

40:02.291 --> 40:03.536
I don't understand.

40:03.709 --> 40:06.995
It's a lesbian joke. A bad one.

40:07.797 --> 40:09.505
Do you want another drink?

40:09.674 --> 40:12.545
Actually, I gotta go.
I have an early shift tomorrow.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.843
- Kerry-
- It was really...

40:15.014 --> 40:17.505
It was really nice to meet you both.

40:26.942 --> 40:28.935
- Wait. Are you upset?
- No.

40:29.111 --> 40:31.602
Well, why are you leaving, then?

40:31.781 --> 40:34.403
I don't belong here.
I don't belong here.

40:34.576 --> 40:38.028
I dated Christy in college.
Kate and I dated for maybe a month-

40:38.205 --> 40:40.530
It's not that. This isn't me.

40:40.707 --> 40:45.369
I mean, my experience,
the jokes, your friends.

40:45.546 --> 40:47.788
I'm... I care about you.

40:47.965 --> 40:52.212
I'm not interested
in adopting a lifestyle.

40:55.223 --> 40:58.224
Wow, I can't believe
you just said that.

41:00.103 --> 41:02.594
I'll call you later.

41:13.033 --> 41:14.907
Just drive.

41:23.878 --> 41:25.538
Dr. Kovac.

41:25.755 --> 41:28.044
I was helping him off
with his dolman.

41:28.216 --> 41:31.336
He was very short of breath,
and he just collapsed.

41:36.975 --> 41:38.850
Oh, God!

41:39.061 --> 41:41.979
Bishop Stewart, can you hear me?

41:42.148 --> 41:43.227
Call 911.

41:43.399 --> 41:46.353
Tell them we have a man
with impending respiratory arrest.

41:56.996 --> 41:58.621
Mark?

42:04.088 --> 42:06.294
Mark, you home?

42:17.977 --> 42:19.555
Mark?

42:20.981 --> 42:22.641
Mark.

42:23.650 --> 42:25.560
Are you okay?

42:26.361 --> 42:30.359
He recommended
formal competency testing.

42:31.367 --> 42:35.316
Psychiatrists, neuropsychologists,
MRI, personality tests...

42:35.496 --> 42:38.247
It's gonna take five days.

42:40.334 --> 42:42.660
I'm so sorry.

42:44.214 --> 42:47.630
The good times just keep coming.

43:15.413 --> 43:17.073
Luka?

43:19.751 --> 43:21.909
What are you doing?

43:22.712 --> 43:25.964
I couldn't find a forest.

43:27.385 --> 43:29.212
What?

43:34.475 --> 43:37.476
You brought Bishop Stewart back in?

43:37.854 --> 43:39.681
How's he doing?

43:40.023 --> 43:42.062
He's dying.

43:43.234 --> 43:45.393
He might surprise you.

43:46.237 --> 43:49.903
We get enough miracles around here.
Why not one more?

43:54.914 --> 43:56.953
I'm freezing.

43:57.750 --> 44:00.455
- Ready to go home?
- Yeah.
