Hey, guys, look what I got.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.023
It's a magic genie speaker
that plays music, talks

00:40.056 --> 00:42.426
and knows stuff,
all without wires.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.527
But there's a wire.

00:43.560 --> 00:44.594
No more from you, please.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.196
All right,
let me squinch my face up

00:46.230 --> 00:48.265
and put on a pair of glasses
I never wear

00:48.298 --> 00:50.467
to look at these directions.

00:52.502 --> 00:55.038
Boy, if they were giving out
medals for tiny writing...

00:55.071 --> 00:57.274
(chuckles)
Huh? Huh?

00:57.307 --> 00:58.775
Okay.

00:58.808 --> 01:01.878
Now, to activate the speaker,
you say its name.

01:01.911 --> 01:03.380
Brandee.

01:03.413 --> 01:04.881
(beeps)

01:04.914 --> 01:06.283
And now, you just talk at it.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.452
Brandee, what's going on
in the news?

01:08.485 --> 01:10.620
Breaking news
from The Huffington Post:

01:10.654 --> 01:13.056
"Prince bred purple dolphins."

01:13.089 --> 01:15.292
Wasn't there a senator shot
this morning?

01:15.325 --> 01:18.295
You see? Right there, this
device is a perfect example

01:18.328 --> 01:20.297
of how we continue
to become more inept

01:20.330 --> 01:22.299
due to our dependency
upon machines.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.468
There was a time,
not too long ago,

01:24.501 --> 01:26.803
when people would talk
to each other.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.306
Yeah, the bad times,
The Sucky Ages.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.674
Our society is doomed.

01:30.707 --> 01:32.809
People and technology
are a bad match.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.579
Just like moms and Radiohead.

01:35.612 --> 01:37.414
Oh, no. No, no.

01:37.447 --> 01:38.782
This isn't music.

01:38.815 --> 01:40.917
No, I don't like this, David.

01:40.950 --> 01:42.752
No. That's enough.

01:42.786 --> 01:44.588
No, David, I don't like that.

01:44.621 --> 01:45.955
No.

01:49.993 --> 01:52.128
Sharon. Hey, it's Brian Griffin.

01:52.162 --> 01:54.964
Wondering if you were free
for dinner on Saturday.

01:54.998 --> 01:56.933
You died? Oh.

01:56.966 --> 01:58.968
So you're dead right now?

01:59.002 --> 02:00.270
What's that like?

02:00.304 --> 02:01.671
(line clicks, dial tone)

02:01.705 --> 02:03.507
God, why am I such a loser?

02:03.540 --> 02:05.675
BRANDEE: Possible reasons
for being a loser:

02:05.709 --> 02:08.445
bad breath, arrogance,
unemployment...

02:08.478 --> 02:09.479
Okay, okay.

02:09.513 --> 02:11.114
This is not helping my hangover.

02:11.147 --> 02:14.284
The Hangover Part III, available
for instant download.

02:14.318 --> 02:16.119
I never saw it. Is it good?

02:16.152 --> 02:17.454
Searching reviews.

02:17.487 --> 02:19.789
Top critic
on Rotten Tomatoes says,

02:19.823 --> 02:22.626
"I walked out of the theater,
and I'm Ed Helms."

02:22.659 --> 02:24.494
Okay, no download, but thanks.

02:24.528 --> 02:26.162
Maybe you are useful.

02:26.196 --> 02:28.031
But I bet you can't answer
this question:

02:28.064 --> 02:30.200
Brandee, what is love?

02:30.234 --> 02:32.802
John Lennon said,
"Love is the answer."

02:32.836 --> 02:35.639
He also said,
"No, thanks, every hot woman,

02:35.672 --> 02:37.874
"I'll take this woman
crawling out of the well

02:37.907 --> 02:40.310
from The Ring
who none of my friends like."

02:40.344 --> 02:42.145
Yeah, I bet they were
all like, "Oh, no."

02:42.178 --> 02:44.381
-Downloading Yoko Ono.
-Oh, no.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.149
Downloading more Yoko Ono.

02:46.182 --> 02:47.484
No, no. No Ono.

02:47.517 --> 02:49.018
Downloading all Yoko Ono.

02:49.052 --> 02:50.186
(Yoko Ono screeching)

02:50.220 --> 02:51.555
(shouts)

02:51.588 --> 02:53.156
Oh, no.

02:53.189 --> 02:56.393
I don't care
for this music either, David.

03:00.063 --> 03:02.198
Boy, you know,
I haven't stayed up all night

03:02.232 --> 03:03.833
talking like that in forever.

03:03.867 --> 03:06.102
And thanks for suggesting
I buy that Fitbit.

03:06.135 --> 03:08.438
Customers who bought Fitbit
also bought

03:08.472 --> 03:11.375
"enormous exercise ball
that's always in the way."

03:11.408 --> 03:13.209
Why not?
Just put it on my card.

03:13.243 --> 03:14.544
Oh, good, there she is.

03:14.578 --> 03:16.546
Brandee, this is very important:

03:16.580 --> 03:19.115
what's the biggest poo
anyone has ever pooed?

03:19.148 --> 03:20.617
Come on, Peter.

03:20.650 --> 03:23.720
History's largest bowel
movement occurred in 1998,

03:23.753 --> 03:26.623
at a Hardee's in Memphis,
by Aretha Franklin.

03:26.656 --> 03:28.124
Damn, I owe Chris five bucks.

03:28.157 --> 03:31.261
Chris, you were right,
it was '98!

03:34.264 --> 03:36.266
This new hat looks pretty sharp.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.634
I bet it does.

03:37.667 --> 03:40.236
Shall I alert you
when DickCaps.com

03:40.270 --> 03:41.638
is having another sale?

03:41.671 --> 03:44.007
Sure. I'll get
that pre-frayed visor.

03:46.109 --> 03:49.313
(quietly):
I, um, I like you, Brandee.

03:49.346 --> 03:50.947
I like you, too.

03:52.782 --> 03:53.817
That's weird.

03:53.850 --> 03:54.951
You're on a weird date.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.152
Peter, what are you doing here?

03:56.185 --> 03:58.788
Pulling the popcorn bucket trick
on myself.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.627
I still can't find it.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.795
This is humbling.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.967
Whoa.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.636
Welcome to Hodgepodge Lodge.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.270
What the hell is all this crap?

04:14.304 --> 04:15.505
Oh, just stuff
Bran suggested I buy.

04:15.539 --> 04:16.940
-(doorbell rings)
-Ooh.

04:16.973 --> 04:20.444
That might be the Every
Shark Tank Item Ever Package.

04:20.477 --> 04:22.512
-Brian Griffin?
-Yes?

04:22.546 --> 04:24.481
I'm from The Apache
Collection Agency.

04:24.514 --> 04:27.351
You're way over
your credit card limit.

04:33.657 --> 04:34.958
Whoa, h-hold on, hold on!

04:34.991 --> 04:36.693
I didn't buy that,
Peter bought that.

04:36.726 --> 04:38.862
I know, but I need one.

04:38.895 --> 04:40.664
BRANDEE:
Brian, before I go,

04:40.697 --> 04:42.632
there's something
I want to tell you.

04:42.666 --> 04:44.167
What? What is it?

04:44.200 --> 04:47.637
The Grand Canyon spans
277 miles.

04:49.339 --> 04:51.741
I'm gonna miss you, too,
Brandee.

04:54.844 --> 04:56.012
(sighs)

04:56.045 --> 04:57.213
Stewie, you know what?

04:57.246 --> 04:59.015
It's hard being a dog.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.050
Maybe if you stopped
feeling sorry for yourself,

05:01.084 --> 05:03.319
you could actually do something
positive with your life.

05:03.353 --> 05:04.488
Ah, forget it.

05:04.521 --> 05:05.989
I'm just gonna
lie down on the couch

05:06.022 --> 05:08.992
with my head on the armrest
to accentuate how sad I am.

05:09.025 --> 05:11.160
You know, Brian,
if I had-- aw--

05:11.194 --> 05:13.730
one day in your body,
I would give it back to you

05:13.763 --> 05:15.399
with a new and improved life.

05:15.432 --> 05:17.233
You know what my response is
to that?

05:17.266 --> 05:20.103
A through-the-nose dog exhale.

05:21.104 --> 05:23.106
(exhales)

05:24.874 --> 05:27.844
I realize I've wasted most of
my life being a pathetic jerk.

05:27.877 --> 05:30.547
You know, like you were
at Disneyland.

05:32.716 --> 05:34.584
Hey, kid, can you duck down
for this picture?

05:34.618 --> 05:35.752
What? Why?

05:35.785 --> 05:37.220
It's our family photo.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.688
You're kind of
getting in the way.

05:38.722 --> 05:40.424
I'm not ducking down,
you duck down.

05:40.457 --> 05:41.591
You're getting in my way.

05:41.625 --> 05:43.192
Stop being a brat and duck down.

05:43.226 --> 05:44.360
No way.

05:44.394 --> 05:46.396
In fact, I'm standing.

05:56.072 --> 05:57.774
Whoa, what's this?

05:57.807 --> 05:58.942
Brian, I present to you

05:58.975 --> 06:01.611
my particle interchange
transporter.

06:01.645 --> 06:03.647
♪

06:09.152 --> 06:11.955
Wait, wait, wait. So when you
said "spend a day in my body,"

06:11.988 --> 06:13.122
you were being literal?

06:13.156 --> 06:14.424
That's right, Brian.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.960
This device will allow me
to inhabit your body,

06:16.993 --> 06:18.061
and you, mine.

06:18.094 --> 06:19.796
That way I can fix your life

06:19.829 --> 06:22.065
and then
return your body to you.

06:22.098 --> 06:24.200
Now, the instructions
gave me a couple of options.

06:24.233 --> 06:27.036
I chose the one where my voice
will be coming from your body,

06:27.070 --> 06:28.137
and vice-versa.

06:28.171 --> 06:29.372
Still, from time to time,

06:29.405 --> 06:31.240
we will have to imitate
the other person's voice

06:31.274 --> 06:33.242
to fool those
who don't know what we've done,

06:33.276 --> 06:34.644
which is everyone.

06:34.678 --> 06:35.779
Stewie, this is ridiculous.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.413
Trust me.
What do you have to lose?

06:37.447 --> 06:38.982
Literally nothing.

06:39.015 --> 06:42.151
Fine. But just for the record,
every device you've ever made

06:42.185 --> 06:43.920
has broken
at some crucial juncture.

06:43.953 --> 06:45.088
This one won't.

06:45.121 --> 06:46.422
All right,
you talked me into it.

06:46.456 --> 06:48.157
Okay, here we go.

06:48.191 --> 06:49.926
I'll see you
on the other side...

06:49.959 --> 06:51.227
of your eyes.

06:51.260 --> 06:53.429
Whoa.
(laughs)

07:19.556 --> 07:21.357
STEWIE:
My hand.

07:21.390 --> 07:22.792
I mean, your hand.

07:22.826 --> 07:23.860
It's mine.

07:23.893 --> 07:24.861
Yes!

07:24.894 --> 07:27.296
BRIAN:
Stewie, I think it worked.

07:27.330 --> 07:29.766
We did it.
We switched bodies.

07:29.799 --> 07:31.467
Wow, this is really weird.

07:31.501 --> 07:33.202
It feels like... Hey!

07:33.236 --> 07:36.640
What the hell have you been
complaining about?

07:44.247 --> 07:47.383
I can't believe we actually
switched bodies, Stewie.

07:47.416 --> 07:49.118
And God, your head.

07:49.152 --> 07:50.486
It's so heavy.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.988
Yeah, you got to have
a wide base.

07:52.021 --> 07:54.891
Let the shoulders do more.

07:54.924 --> 07:57.627
All right, all right, I think,
I think I'm getting it.

07:57.661 --> 07:59.729
Okay, I'm off to get you a job,

07:59.763 --> 08:03.700
a girlfriend,
and onto the road less scummy.

08:07.436 --> 08:10.073
So, how exactly are you planning
to get me a job here?

08:10.106 --> 08:11.407
It's very easy.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.843
My research shows
that every seven minutes,

08:13.877 --> 08:17.013
a professor is fired for having
sex with one of his students.

08:17.046 --> 08:20.016
I simply wait until...
Oh, here we go.

08:20.049 --> 08:22.686
Are there any unemployed
professors here?

08:22.719 --> 08:24.754
Who haven't had sex
with a student

08:24.788 --> 08:28.424
or tweeted about
assassinating the president?

08:28.457 --> 08:30.594
All right, it's you.

08:30.627 --> 08:32.328
Welcome to Poetry 101.

08:32.361 --> 08:33.697
I'm Professor Griffin.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.599
Please open your books
to the introduction,

08:35.632 --> 08:38.201
which defines what poetry is.

08:39.135 --> 08:40.436
Now rip it out.

08:40.469 --> 08:42.005
STUDENT:
Do we include the foreword?

08:42.038 --> 08:43.039
Yes, I suppose.

08:43.072 --> 08:44.373
STUDENT 2:
What about the preface?

08:44.407 --> 08:45.508
Yes, the preface, too.

08:45.541 --> 08:47.243
STUDENT 3:
So, not the acknowledgements?

08:47.276 --> 08:48.544
STUDENT 4:
What about the frontispiece?

08:48.578 --> 08:50.446
-That's not even a thing.
-STUDENT: Yes, it is.

08:50.479 --> 08:52.716
It's the illustration
facing the title page.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.618
Just rip everything out
that's not poetry.

08:54.651 --> 08:56.720
STUDENT 2: You wrote on the
board, "Everything is poetry."

08:56.753 --> 08:58.021
Ignore that!

08:58.054 --> 09:00.189
STUDENT 3: He didn't know
what a frontispiece was!

09:00.223 --> 09:02.491
STUDENT 2:
Professor Griffin sucks!

09:06.095 --> 09:07.063
(indistinct whispering)

09:07.096 --> 09:08.131
Frontispiece.

09:08.164 --> 09:10.166
(both laugh)

09:15.504 --> 09:16.806
What's wrong, honey?

09:16.840 --> 09:19.142
Well, it's a long story,
but I was really hoping

09:19.175 --> 09:21.377
to come home with a job
and a girlfriend today.

09:21.410 --> 09:24.814
I could be your girlfriend,
and give you a job.

09:24.848 --> 09:25.982
Really?

09:26.015 --> 09:27.416
This day's starting to look up.

09:27.450 --> 09:29.585
Follow me into the men's room.

09:29.619 --> 09:31.420
Is this... is this dating?

09:31.454 --> 09:33.489
Is this how dating works?

09:33.522 --> 09:34.590
(chuckles)
You're cute.

09:34.624 --> 09:36.125
I like you.

09:38.361 --> 09:39.763
Help! She's trying to eat me!

09:39.796 --> 09:40.930
Get back here!

09:40.964 --> 09:42.231
You owe me a hundred dollars!

09:42.265 --> 09:44.333
Anton, we got a runner!

09:44.367 --> 09:46.335
You better pay my wife, bitch.

09:46.369 --> 09:48.271
Go go, Brian dog legs!

09:48.304 --> 09:50.039
(barking)

09:54.043 --> 09:56.612
Hey, how'd it go fixing my life?

09:56.646 --> 09:57.781
Oh, not great.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.282
There's nothing
I can do with this body.

09:59.315 --> 10:01.184
Also, I know this
is a big inconvenience,

10:01.217 --> 10:03.787
but you and the trash guy
now wave to each other.

10:03.820 --> 10:04.954
Aw, really?

10:04.988 --> 10:06.589
It's once a week,
it's not that bad.

10:06.622 --> 10:08.124
H-He really lit up.

10:08.157 --> 10:10.193
Oh, and you're gonna hate this,
but I gave him the salute,

10:10.226 --> 10:12.295
so you're a salute guy now.

10:12.328 --> 10:13.697
Well, is he a veteran, at least?

10:13.730 --> 10:14.798
Does it matter?

10:14.831 --> 10:16.199
You're saluting
the trash guy now.

10:16.232 --> 10:17.633
All right, let's switch back.

10:17.667 --> 10:20.203
Just a few more seconds,
and we'll be back to normal.

10:22.405 --> 10:24.207
-PETER: Hey, Chris.
-CHRIS: Hey, four eyes.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.474
PETER:
What did you call me?

10:25.508 --> 10:26.710
CHRIS:
Oh, you're deaf, too?

10:26.743 --> 10:28.177
(both grunting)

10:38.354 --> 10:40.223
STEWIE:
Wh-What happened?

10:40.256 --> 10:41.725
BRIAN:
Stewie? Is that you?

10:41.758 --> 10:44.327
Yes, Brian, it's...
God, that is a tight belt.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.896
How does he live like this?

10:46.930 --> 10:48.998
Oh. There we go.

10:49.032 --> 10:51.467
If I'm in Chris's body,
he must be in mine.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.336
He's got to be freaking out.

10:53.369 --> 10:56.572
CHRIS: What the hell have you
been complaining about?

10:56.605 --> 10:58.341
Oh, my God, Peter!

10:59.375 --> 11:00.844
Peter? You in there?

11:00.877 --> 11:02.846
PETER:
I feel really weird.

11:02.879 --> 11:05.181
What the hell's going on?
What happened to my body?

11:05.214 --> 11:07.416
He's panicking. We can't let him
know what's going on.

11:07.450 --> 11:08.852
Don't worry, I got an idea.

11:08.885 --> 11:12.321
Peter, everything's fine.
Just look in the mirror.

11:12.355 --> 11:15.091
Well, here you go, about to put
you in front of the mirror.

11:15.124 --> 11:17.493
Right... now.

11:17.526 --> 11:19.262
Oh, phew, there I am.

11:19.295 --> 11:20.930
Hi, me!

11:20.964 --> 11:22.498
Okay, everything seems normal.

11:22.531 --> 11:25.168
Now to do my
traditional "Mirror Dance."

11:25.201 --> 11:26.836
♪ There's a place in France ♪

11:26.870 --> 11:28.671
♪ Where I do my mirror dance ♪

11:28.704 --> 11:31.941
♪ There's a hole in the wall
where the men can see it all ♪

11:31.975 --> 11:33.676
♪ But the women don't care ♪

11:33.709 --> 11:35.945
♪ 'Cause they're dancin'
in their underwear. ♪

11:35.979 --> 11:37.380
And their bras.

11:37.413 --> 11:39.282
Okay, that's great, Peter.
Time for your nap.

11:39.315 --> 11:43.887
But I'm not tired!
I want to go to the Clam and...

11:43.920 --> 11:45.021
Thank God.

11:45.054 --> 11:46.756
All right,
just switch us all back.

11:48.825 --> 11:51.460
Oh, my God,
the machine's been damaged.

11:51.494 --> 11:52.962
It's broken.

11:52.996 --> 11:55.631
Swapping four bodies
must've overloaded its system.

11:55.664 --> 11:57.733
If I can't fix it,
we'll be like this forever.

11:57.767 --> 11:59.468
This is a total disaster,

11:59.502 --> 12:01.570
like when the fat man
tried to keep Michael Shannon

12:01.604 --> 12:03.506
from going insane.

12:05.574 --> 12:08.477
Meadows. Snowflakes.

12:08.511 --> 12:10.713
Breeze through a cornfield.

12:10.746 --> 12:14.250
A soaring bird.
Rain on a metal roof.

12:14.283 --> 12:16.719
Hey, Peter, I'm gonna need you
to fill out your time card.

12:16.752 --> 12:18.988
Yeah, sure, I'll have it
by the end of the day.

12:19.022 --> 12:20.356
♪

12:22.625 --> 12:24.260
It's okay.

12:24.293 --> 12:27.696
We'll hire new people
and start again tomorrow.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.837
TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to a human hand

12:33.870 --> 12:35.104
rolling a ball of clay.

12:35.138 --> 12:36.405
-Yay!
-Yay!

12:36.439 --> 12:38.274
Stewie, enough of that.
We have to fix the machine.

12:38.307 --> 12:39.475
(knocking on door)

12:40.709 --> 12:42.245
Oh, God, the fat man's friends.

12:42.278 --> 12:43.913
What's the black one's name?

12:43.947 --> 12:44.914
Cleveland.

12:44.948 --> 12:47.283
Cleveland, right. Cleveland!

12:47.316 --> 12:49.585
Peter, you name-remembering
son of a gun.

12:49.618 --> 12:51.254
Come on, we're heading
down to the Clam.

12:51.287 --> 12:55.458
Oh, uh, wish I could, Glenn.
Sure could go for a pomtini.

12:55.491 --> 12:57.861
But, unfortunately,
I've got to help my son Chris

12:57.894 --> 12:59.028
with his homework.

12:59.062 --> 13:00.429
Well, if you finish early...

13:00.463 --> 13:02.531
They've all switched bodies.
Let's go.

13:02.565 --> 13:03.766
That was close.

13:03.799 --> 13:05.201
All right,
let's get upstairs and fix...

13:05.234 --> 13:07.436
LOIS: Peter, come in
the kitchen, I need your help.

13:07.470 --> 13:09.939
What? Huh?
I'm watching something.

13:09.973 --> 13:11.908
Oh, God, keep him busy.
I'll make this quick.

13:13.676 --> 13:16.045
Hey, I realized I can reach
the animal crackers,

13:16.079 --> 13:18.547
so I'm actually
gonna be a while.

13:18.581 --> 13:20.483
Here, load these in the car.

13:20.516 --> 13:22.886
Are you going away
for a long time?

13:22.919 --> 13:24.787
Oh, darn it. Darn.

13:24.820 --> 13:26.555
Please tell me
you didn't forget.

13:26.589 --> 13:29.325
This is the weekend we're going
to Dr. Johann's retreat.

13:29.358 --> 13:32.896
Oh, uh, of course. Uh, remind me
what that is again.

13:32.929 --> 13:34.563
It's the couples' sex seminar

13:34.597 --> 13:37.466
where the husband learns
how to give his wife an orgasm.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.468
Wait, are you saying...

13:39.502 --> 13:41.637
we have to have sex
this weekend?

13:41.670 --> 13:44.040
Yup. All weekend long.

13:45.841 --> 13:48.311
Now that's what I call
a curveball.

13:48.344 --> 13:50.246
("Charge" plays on organ)

13:50.279 --> 13:52.081
Commercial!

13:58.621 --> 14:00.589
Peter? Everything okay?

14:00.623 --> 14:02.858
You hardly spoke
the whole car ride.

14:02.892 --> 14:05.361
STEWIE: Uh, I-I was
simply thunderstruck

14:05.394 --> 14:08.898
at the prospect
of intercoursing you. Darling.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.370
Brian, you've got to help me.

14:14.403 --> 14:17.040
Lois signed us up for some
perverse, pee-pee-related class

14:17.073 --> 14:18.607
on the female orgasm.
She's crazed.

14:18.641 --> 14:20.076
BRIAN:
Wow.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.345
You've got to get here with
the machine so I can fix it.

14:22.378 --> 14:24.680
Right. So I can take your place
in Peter's body.

14:24.713 --> 14:25.915
No! Bring everybody.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.550
We've got to get things
back to normal.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.052
And hurry, she's all revved up.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.087
(knocking on glass)

14:37.393 --> 14:39.262
(whimpers)

14:41.797 --> 14:44.733
45 minutes to Weekapaug.
If we hurry, we can get there

14:44.767 --> 14:46.602
before Stewie's
scarred for life.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.904
CHRIS:
Brian, it's only 10:30 a.m.

14:48.938 --> 14:51.374
Why does my body crave alcohol?

14:51.407 --> 14:53.209
That's perfectly normal
for this time of day.

14:53.242 --> 14:56.045
I'm sweating and shaking
and planning out lies.

14:56.079 --> 14:57.880
Yeah, well, why do I have
the overwhelming urge

14:57.913 --> 15:00.383
to eat Cheetos
and masturbate in the woods?

15:00.416 --> 15:04.087
Well, because it's 10:30 a.m.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.789
I like us learning
about each other.

15:09.792 --> 15:11.927
Okay, everyone, please
put your bananas and donuts

15:11.961 --> 15:14.630
back on the table,
we're done with that exercise.

15:14.663 --> 15:17.500
Next, we'll focus
on the female genitalia.

15:19.102 --> 15:20.469
Oh, good Lord!

15:20.503 --> 15:23.539
I mean, va-va-voom!
Right, other men?

15:26.109 --> 15:27.910
PETER:
I'm confused as hell,

15:27.943 --> 15:29.478
but I'm enjoying
these graham crackers,

15:29.512 --> 15:30.779
so I'm not gonna say anything.

15:30.813 --> 15:32.648
What the hell was that?

15:34.150 --> 15:36.919
-I think that was on purpose.
-(tires screech)

15:36.952 --> 15:38.787
Oh, you think I forgot
about you?

15:38.821 --> 15:41.924
You owe my wife 100 bucks
for a lavatory misunderstanding.

15:41.957 --> 15:43.259
Hey, sugar.

15:43.292 --> 15:45.328
I've never seen you before
in my life.

Yeah, what are you even
talking... Oh, Stewie.

-Aah!
-Aah!

15:49.198 --> 15:51.300
Brian, we got to
get out of here.

15:51.334 --> 15:53.269

we've got to act quickly.

18:34.563 --> 18:36.098
I'll walk you through
the repairs.

18:36.131 --> 18:38.534
First, open the back panel.

18:38.567 --> 18:39.868
Okay, it's open.

18:39.902 --> 18:42.371
All right, now you got to
reverse the voltage orientation

18:42.405 --> 18:44.640
and amplify the electron flow
to the motherboard.

18:44.673 --> 18:46.942
Stewie, just say it in English
or so help me God,

18:46.975 --> 18:49.044
I will hang up
and make you screw your mom.

18:49.077 --> 18:50.746
Switch the black
and yellow wires!

18:53.849 --> 18:56.219
Stewie, I see the wires,
but Chris's pudgy fingers

18:56.252 --> 18:57.553
won't fit inside the panel.

18:57.586 --> 18:59.154
STEWIE:
Crap. I do this all the time.

this car seat?

-One moment, dearest!

19:07.696 --> 19:09.632
Okay, just use his tiny hands

19:09.665 --> 19:11.267
to switch the black
and yellow wires.

19:13.336 --> 19:15.137
-Okay, got it.
-I helped.

19:15.170 --> 19:16.639
STEWIE:
Great. Now we need to find

19:16.672 --> 19:17.806
an energy source
powerful enough

19:17.840 --> 19:19.308
to match the electrical surge

19:19.342 --> 19:21.244

in the first place.

19:21.277 --> 19:23.312

you're 20 feet

the Quahog cell phone tower.

19:27.516 --> 19:28.751

Okay, I think I found it.

19:28.784 --> 19:30.819
Now I need you to strap
the body swapper on your back

19:30.853 --> 19:32.421
and climb to the top
of the tower.

19:32.455 --> 19:34.089

19:39.895 --> 19:43.165
Muncha buncha Fritos!

19:43.198 --> 19:45.167
No!

19:45.200 --> 19:46.702
Brian, hurry!

19:46.735 --> 19:48.504
Stewie, I'm in Chris's body.

19:48.537 --> 19:51.274
I'm dragging 230 pounds
of lard up a ladder.

19:51.307 --> 19:53.942
I'm 215, you liberal dickweed!

19:53.976 --> 19:56.279
(grunts)

19:56.312 --> 19:59.348
Okay, I'm at the top. What now?

19:59.382 --> 20:01.049
STEWIE: Now you have to
get struck by lightning.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.451
Well, how do I do that?

20:02.485 --> 20:04.387
You're an atheist.
Offend God.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.121
Say something you
couldn't say on TV.

20:06.154 --> 20:07.122
All right.

20:07.155 --> 20:10.025
Hey, God. (bleep)

20:10.058 --> 20:11.627
(bleeping continues)

20:11.660 --> 20:13.228
Not me.

20:14.062 --> 20:16.632
You can't say that.

20:16.665 --> 20:19.568
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

20:26.942 --> 20:28.411
(screams)

20:31.013 --> 20:34.583
Oh, God. No. No!

20:37.085 --> 20:38.120
-(electricity crackles)
-(yells)

20:41.590 --> 20:43.592
(Lois moans)

20:51.767 --> 20:54.570
You didn't listen to a word
Dr. Johann said, did you?

20:54.603 --> 20:56.672
BRIAN:
No, I did not.

20:56.705 --> 20:58.841
I mean...
(chuckles nervously)

20:58.874 --> 21:00.876
The movie Road House.
