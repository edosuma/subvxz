WEBVTT

00:00.020 --> 00:01.964
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...

00:05.922 --> 00:07.350
You owe me answers.

00:07.351 --> 00:09.552
Being thrust into a world
you never knew existed

00:09.553 --> 00:11.020
can be unnerving.

00:11.021 --> 00:12.588
Why did you leave the military?

00:12.589 --> 00:14.090
I had a baby, Molly.

00:14.091 --> 00:16.158
She's ten. She stopped talking.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.060
It's an archive of unexplained phenomena

00:18.061 --> 00:19.529
We call it "the Vault."

00:19.530 --> 00:22.565
I do news, and Alex does
artifacts and machines.

00:22.566 --> 00:25.735
This is the secret history of America.

00:27.738 --> 00:30.807
There really is no amount of blood

00:30.808 --> 00:34.210
that I won't spill to
get the rest of these.

00:34.211 --> 00:36.479
I met some new people today at work.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.147
Complete weirdoes,

00:38.148 --> 00:40.416
which means you'll probably like 'em.

00:55.866 --> 00:57.066
Lieutenant?

01:05.141 --> 01:06.576
Abbie?

01:12.983 --> 01:14.250
Lieutenant?!

01:16.119 --> 01:17.386
Lieutenant?

01:26.230 --> 01:28.030
Reveal yourself!

01:28.031 --> 01:29.332
Oh!

01:35.138 --> 01:37.540
Who are you?

01:46.884 --> 01:49.919
Miss Jenny.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.420
Miss Jenny.

01:53.891 --> 01:56.225
You may desist.

01:56.226 --> 01:57.660
Wow.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.030
That was deep.

02:01.031 --> 02:03.266
How long was I under?

02:03.267 --> 02:05.434
Well, it's tomorrow now, so...

02:05.435 --> 02:07.370
Good Lord.

02:07.371 --> 02:11.207
Uh, my apologies.

02:13.176 --> 02:15.444
Mysticism is...

02:15.445 --> 02:18.047
not an exact science.

02:24.087 --> 02:27.890
So, did the Singing Bowl rite
reveal anything of interest?

02:27.891 --> 02:30.893
Uh, it, was... a little more

02:30.894 --> 02:33.095
puzzling than definitive.

02:33.096 --> 02:35.239
Right, well, like you said,
it's not an exact science.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.366
The Singing Bowl was the closest thing

02:37.367 --> 02:39.035
I could find to a new Witness detector.

02:39.036 --> 02:41.304
It's been used for
centuries by the followers

02:41.305 --> 02:43.472
of the Dalai Lama to track down

02:43.473 --> 02:45.341
the inheritor of his
role and responsibilities.

02:45.342 --> 02:47.510
And as the "Mantle of Witness"

02:47.511 --> 02:51.180
has been passed from Abbie to...

02:51.181 --> 02:54.216
to another.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.555
A girl.

02:59.556 --> 03:01.524
I saw a girl.

03:01.525 --> 03:03.492
Uh, she was...

03:03.493 --> 03:07.430
Uh, she was no more than
ten or 11 years, and she'd...

03:07.431 --> 03:09.165
I'd not seen her before.

03:10.901 --> 03:12.668
But there was something familiar.

03:14.538 --> 03:16.038
I need air.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.281
Should we try again?

03:25.282 --> 03:27.350
No.

03:27.351 --> 03:28.784
I think...

03:28.785 --> 03:30.486
we should allow ourselves some time

03:30.487 --> 03:32.455
to recapitulate.

03:35.125 --> 03:37.393
Miss Jenny,

03:37.394 --> 03:40.596
it should not go unsaid...

03:40.597 --> 03:43.466
I do appreciate you relocating for me.

03:45.235 --> 03:48.104
Abbie was your partner,
but she was my sister.

03:48.105 --> 03:50.272
Whoever this new Witness
is, they're gonna benefit

03:50.273 --> 03:52.541
from what I know about the experience.

03:54.378 --> 03:57.346
And a change of scenery
would be good for me, so...

03:57.347 --> 04:00.249
Hmm, and it is scenery worthy of

04:00.250 --> 04:01.917
Nebuchadnezzar himself.

04:01.918 --> 04:04.987
Yeah, my friend Larry owns
it, so it was dirt cheap.

04:06.728 --> 04:08.111
Plus, the sound of heavy machinery

04:08.112 --> 04:09.535
puts me to sleep like nothing else.

04:09.536 --> 04:10.693
Well, it is very...

04:10.694 --> 04:12.461
you.

04:17.267 --> 04:18.567
This girl you saw;

04:18.567 --> 04:20.569
visions are often more figurative

04:20.570 --> 04:22.238
than they are literal.

04:22.239 --> 04:23.939
I've got a book on interpretations

04:23.940 --> 04:25.074
of Bhakti trances.

04:25.075 --> 04:26.275
I'll give it a look and see

04:26.276 --> 04:27.777
if there's anything we missed.

04:27.778 --> 04:30.179
And our newly discovered Vault

04:30.180 --> 04:32.281
should hold some
valuable answers as well.

04:32.282 --> 04:33.616
Can you just walk in there?

04:33.617 --> 04:35.618
It's not exactly a public library.

04:35.619 --> 04:39.722
Well, Washington intended
for me to use its content.

04:39.723 --> 04:42.925
And I intend to honor his wishes.

04:42.926 --> 04:44.660
Then good hunting.

04:51.935 --> 04:53.402
You can't brush this off.

04:53.403 --> 04:56.105
And you can't keep
hounding me, Donaldson.

04:56.106 --> 04:57.473
You broke ground in my district

04:57.474 --> 04:59.075
without going through proper channels.

04:59.076 --> 05:00.810
Oh, is that what this is all about?

05:00.811 --> 05:03.345
Aw, you feel disrespected.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.748
A situation you would do well to remedy.

05:05.749 --> 05:09.151
Do you know how many green
energy subcommittees I sit on?

05:09.152 --> 05:10.920
I'm-I'm a little confused.

05:10.921 --> 05:15.091
So you really, really think I care?

05:15.092 --> 05:16.425
You better start!

05:16.426 --> 05:18.160
You've been digging, Dreyfuss.

05:18.161 --> 05:19.862
So have I.

05:19.863 --> 05:22.264
You talk a good game
on environmental issues,

05:22.265 --> 05:24.667
but your construction crews are still...

05:24.668 --> 05:26.802
tearing up farms,

05:26.803 --> 05:29.105
forests, protected wetlands.

05:29.106 --> 05:30.506
You're up to something,

05:30.507 --> 05:32.141
and it's not saving the planet.

05:32.142 --> 05:33.943
Well, how about this? How about you

05:33.944 --> 05:36.112
run along back to that district of yours

05:36.113 --> 05:37.576
and start crowing about all the jobs

05:37.577 --> 05:39.121
that our partnership is gonna create,

05:39.122 --> 05:42.918
and then, how about you
get down on your knees

05:42.919 --> 05:46.522
and pray that what my people
dig up out of the ground

05:46.523 --> 05:49.125
is not...

05:49.126 --> 05:51.060
your body.

05:53.029 --> 05:54.530
Mr. Dreyfuss,

05:54.531 --> 05:56.131
you're late for your morning meeting.

05:57.501 --> 05:59.502
Now, if you'll excuse me, sir,

05:59.503 --> 06:02.504
I have a meeting to get
to that actually matters.

06:12.816 --> 06:16.152
The Dagger of Z'urn D'oragh

06:16.153 --> 06:20.256
is easily the most
sought-after accursed blade

06:20.257 --> 06:22.791
in the whole history of witchcraft.

06:22.792 --> 06:26.295
My treasure in exchange for yours.

06:29.799 --> 06:33.636
Legend has it that
the edge of this blade

06:33.637 --> 06:37.640
brings death to all it cuts.

06:37.641 --> 06:40.910
A deal like this only comes
along once in a century.

06:40.911 --> 06:43.512
And you ladies, of all people,

06:43.513 --> 06:47.650
you know I'm not blowing
the proverbial smoke, right?

06:47.651 --> 06:50.753
We will not hand over the Witch Stone.

06:50.754 --> 06:52.555
Sisters...

06:52.556 --> 06:54.657
perhaps we should return to the world.

06:54.658 --> 06:58.561
We've been away for so very long.

06:58.562 --> 07:01.697
We can't.

07:01.698 --> 07:03.732
Protecting the Witch
Stone is our sacred duty.

07:03.733 --> 07:05.100
Uh, excuse me.

07:05.101 --> 07:07.036
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

07:07.037 --> 07:09.939
but W-Witch Stone? Is that...?

07:09.940 --> 07:11.874
That's really what you call it?

07:11.875 --> 07:15.044
'Cause, I mean, y-you do
know that what you're guarding

07:15.045 --> 07:20.549
actually has nothing whatsoever
to do with witches, don't you?

07:20.550 --> 07:23.319
- Leave now, mortal, or die.
- What do you mean

07:23.320 --> 07:24.938
nothing to do with us?

07:24.939 --> 07:27.607
Well, uh, let me put it this way.

07:27.608 --> 07:31.845
Your predilection is for
detecting liars, right?

07:31.846 --> 07:33.513
Yeah?

07:34.982 --> 07:36.583
Am I lying?

07:46.160 --> 07:47.560
He speaks the truth!

07:47.561 --> 07:51.598
For nearly 300 years,
you have lied to us!

07:51.599 --> 07:52.862
It was for your own good.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.968
You betrayed us.

07:54.969 --> 07:56.402
Our kind was being hunted.

07:56.403 --> 07:58.238
The human commander made me an offer

07:58.239 --> 07:59.773
I knew you would never agree to.

07:59.774 --> 08:01.174
With wicked tongue...

08:01.175 --> 08:02.675
the serpent lied

08:02.676 --> 08:04.778
and took their liberty.
Through poison words,

08:04.779 --> 08:07.380
the world knew sin. Our
hand will set you free.

08:23.330 --> 08:25.298
Yes, sir, I'm, uh...

08:25.299 --> 08:27.967
I'm out the door now.

08:36.811 --> 08:40.013
The concept of pancakes
was not a bad one.

08:40.014 --> 08:42.782
It is the actual making of
them that I find challenging.

08:42.783 --> 08:46.619
So, back to our staple, cold cereal.

08:46.620 --> 08:47.720
Yay.

08:52.393 --> 08:54.027
On the plus side,

08:54.028 --> 08:56.996
since you aren't talking,
you can't complain.

09:03.437 --> 09:06.206
Hey. Hey, sorry. Came
as quick as I could.

09:06.207 --> 09:09.108
- Thank you. She hasn't eaten breakfast.
- Yeah. Okay.

09:09.109 --> 09:11.711
She has finished her homework, right?

09:11.712 --> 09:14.314
Just make sure she's
packed some gym clothes.

09:14.315 --> 09:15.982
Okay.

09:15.983 --> 09:17.817
Nanny Clara's gonna drive you in.

09:17.818 --> 09:18.918
I'll pick you up

09:18.919 --> 09:20.520
from after school.

09:22.623 --> 09:24.724
All right.

09:28.128 --> 09:31.297
I don't know how we'd get
through any of this without you.

09:31.298 --> 09:32.599
I'm sure it's just a phase.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.601
That's what the pediatrician said.

09:34.602 --> 09:38.137
I just hope it's one of the
ones on the shorter side.

09:38.138 --> 09:39.772
Yeah.

09:39.773 --> 09:42.141
Molly?

09:42.877 --> 09:44.043
I love you.

09:44.945 --> 09:47.247
Have a good day.

09:47.248 --> 09:49.682
Yeah.

09:55.322 --> 09:57.123
Rockin'

09:57.124 --> 09:58.791
yesterday's clothes?

09:58.792 --> 10:02.395
Could this be finally
evidence of a walk of shame?

10:02.396 --> 10:05.231
Mm-mm. A walk of triumph.

10:05.232 --> 10:06.966
Mm-hmm. I was up all night trying

10:06.967 --> 10:08.601
to map the rest of these tunnels.

10:08.602 --> 10:11.437
These passageways led to the crypt

10:11.438 --> 10:14.340
of Demon John Wilkes Booth.

10:14.341 --> 10:16.142
Demon Booth.

10:16.143 --> 10:17.644
I mean, can you believe

10:17.645 --> 10:19.245
we have been sitting

10:19.246 --> 10:22.615
just ten feet away from
a labyrinth of secrets,

10:22.616 --> 10:25.285
just waiting to be discovered.

10:25.286 --> 10:28.087
Or waiting to kill us.

10:28.088 --> 10:29.088
Mm.

10:30.491 --> 10:31.758
Very funny.

10:31.759 --> 10:33.059
Yeah, I don't do funny.

10:36.430 --> 10:38.131
Oh. Oh.

10:43.103 --> 10:44.938
Ready or not.

10:52.313 --> 10:53.446
Good morning.

10:53.447 --> 10:56.382
Apologies for the intrusion.

10:56.383 --> 11:00.219
Apparently, I lack the
necessary clearance badge

11:00.220 --> 11:03.289
to access your department
through more civilized means.

11:03.290 --> 11:05.024
Uh, not a problem, at all.

11:05.025 --> 11:08.227
You are more than welcome anytime, okay?

11:08.228 --> 11:10.330
Uh, got a badge we can give him, right?

11:10.331 --> 11:11.664
Uh...

11:11.665 --> 11:14.567
due to a general lack of visitors,

11:14.568 --> 11:17.403
we usually use them to prop
up a table in the kitchen.

11:18.739 --> 11:21.941
Uh, how can the Vault
be of service, hmm?

11:21.942 --> 11:23.176
Books.

11:23.177 --> 11:25.178
I require any books you possess

11:25.179 --> 11:26.946
on dreams and prophecy,

11:26.947 --> 11:29.148
for I must unravel a
mystery presented to me

11:29.149 --> 11:32.919
in a vision conjured by a
mystical Tibetan Singing Bowl.

11:33.854 --> 11:35.421
Be right back.

11:36.123 --> 11:37.457
Do not move!

11:39.493 --> 11:42.895
Everything we've got on
prophetic visions and dreams.

11:42.896 --> 11:45.531
- Yeah.
- Anything else you need?

11:45.532 --> 11:48.067
Not presently.

11:55.809 --> 11:57.477
You know, it might pay

11:57.478 --> 12:01.180
to familiarize yourself with
the Secret Histories over there.

12:01.181 --> 12:02.582
Mm-hmm.

12:02.583 --> 12:05.585
Supernatural threats
lurk in every corner,

12:05.586 --> 12:09.055
and those volumes could provide
clues as to how to defeat them.

12:09.056 --> 12:11.224
Well, problem is they're encrypted.

12:11.225 --> 12:13.393
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.

12:13.394 --> 12:15.395
Fortunately, I had time

12:15.396 --> 12:18.731
to write out the cipher for
that code on my Uber ride.

12:18.732 --> 12:21.300
Done and done.

12:26.407 --> 12:29.509
A little scuffed but
none the worse for wear.

12:29.510 --> 12:33.046
You possess an indefatigable
kindness, Miss Alex.

12:33.047 --> 12:35.915
Just "Alex," no "Miss."

12:35.916 --> 12:39.786
And, um, did you really
have a prophetic dream,

12:39.787 --> 12:41.721
as in seeing the future?

12:41.722 --> 12:43.356
Perhaps.

12:43.357 --> 12:45.291
I seek to discover a legacy.

12:45.292 --> 12:49.562
All that remains of an
important piece of my past.

12:49.563 --> 12:51.230
Cool.

12:51.231 --> 12:53.900
I'm gonna be in the other
room checking my Tinder.

13:00.641 --> 13:02.742
Agent Thomas.

13:02.743 --> 13:05.378
How may I be of assistance?

13:05.379 --> 13:07.080
This area is going to be

13:07.081 --> 13:09.348
swarming with techs
and three kinds of local

13:09.349 --> 13:12.085
law enforcement in 15
minutes, and I have no earthly

13:12.086 --> 13:14.654
explanation for why I've
called you to the scene.

13:14.655 --> 13:18.591
The fact that this body has an
unearthly element is precisely

13:18.592 --> 13:21.027
- why you called me.
- Against my better judgment.

13:21.028 --> 13:22.395
And yet here I am.

13:22.396 --> 13:27.133
And now you have 14 minutes
before the techs arrive.

13:27.134 --> 13:28.801
And counting.

13:28.802 --> 13:30.436
Our victim...

13:30.437 --> 13:31.938
stab wounds in the back,

13:31.939 --> 13:33.473
tongue cut out. Now, normally,

13:33.474 --> 13:35.641
that would point to
Santeria and Wiccan rites.

13:35.642 --> 13:37.910
And, normally, I would
send photos of her wounds

13:37.911 --> 13:40.746
and tattoos, see what we can get. But...

13:40.747 --> 13:42.548
then there's this.

13:42.549 --> 13:45.151
Whatever this is.

13:49.189 --> 13:54.160
What you are seeing is
known as a "Glamour";

13:54.161 --> 13:57.363
a method of mystical camouflage

13:57.364 --> 13:59.699
used since the persecutions in Salem.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.801
As in the Salem witch trials?

14:01.802 --> 14:05.004
The very same.

14:05.005 --> 14:07.106
It would appear the
practice of witchcraft

14:07.107 --> 14:10.610
is alive and thriving
in our nation's capital.

14:36.580 --> 14:44.280
Subtitle sync and corrections by

14:44.476 --> 14:46.277
We need to wrap this up.

14:46.278 --> 14:48.260
Is your dead witch dangerous?

14:48.261 --> 14:49.861
She's not gonna wake
up in the morgue van

14:49.862 --> 14:51.562
and start killing people, is she?

14:51.563 --> 14:53.531
Stranger things have happened.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.034
But no.

14:57.035 --> 14:59.203
I see no signs of necromancy.

14:59.204 --> 15:01.272
Right, 'cause that's a word people use.

15:01.273 --> 15:03.975
As long as the weirdness
ends here, I'm fine with it.

15:05.377 --> 15:09.180
I'm afraid the weirdness
has only just begun.

15:11.283 --> 15:13.618
I know this woman.

15:13.619 --> 15:16.187
- I'm sorry, what?
- As you are aware,

15:16.188 --> 15:18.689
my expertise are not only
supernatural but historical,

15:18.690 --> 15:21.058
particularly in regards
to Sleepy Hollow,

15:21.059 --> 15:22.693
where I believe

15:22.694 --> 15:24.629
this woman visited.

15:25.564 --> 15:29.567
A very long time ago.

15:29.568 --> 15:32.770
In the latter half of
the Revolutionary War,

15:32.771 --> 15:36.107
spies and traitors were everywhere.

15:36.108 --> 15:39.544
A British officer named John Andre,

15:39.545 --> 15:42.547
accused of spying, was
delivered to General Washington

15:42.548 --> 15:44.549
while garrisoned at Sleepy Hollow.

15:44.550 --> 15:47.185
Has he told us anything?

15:47.186 --> 15:50.288
I'm afraid that would
be impossible, General.

15:51.623 --> 15:53.124
Major Andre.

15:53.125 --> 15:55.993
He arrived in this condition.

15:55.994 --> 15:59.163
Tongue cut from his mouth.

16:04.336 --> 16:06.170
Though he could not speak,

16:06.171 --> 16:08.606
papers in Andre's possession
led to the discovery

16:08.607 --> 16:11.275
of Benedict Arnold's treachery.

16:11.276 --> 16:15.780
Both men met with the ultimate
penalty for their crime.

16:15.781 --> 16:19.217
According to the account of
one of Washington's aides,

16:19.218 --> 16:22.520
the general paid thanks to
Andre's capture not to soldiers

16:22.521 --> 16:24.956
or to bounty hunters

16:24.957 --> 16:26.557
but to a trio of women,

16:26.558 --> 16:28.759
the Dyer Sisters,

16:28.760 --> 16:32.730
led by one Moll Dyer.

16:38.670 --> 16:41.305
This brand belongs
to a particular coven.

16:41.306 --> 16:44.809
They were employed to use
their magics to sniff out liars.

16:44.810 --> 16:48.145
Our Jane Doe is one of the Dyer Sisters?

16:48.146 --> 16:51.616
I believe her to be
Moll Dyer, their leader.

16:51.617 --> 16:54.185
Right, a leader of
a lie-detecting coven

16:54.186 --> 16:56.621
weaponized by George Washington.

16:56.622 --> 16:58.189
Right.

16:58.190 --> 17:01.192
Maybe that's why he couldn't tell a lie.

17:01.193 --> 17:03.260
Not to Martha, that's for sure.

17:05.631 --> 17:08.065
The question is,

17:08.066 --> 17:09.700
why, after all this time,

17:09.701 --> 17:11.903
was Moll Dyer murdered? And by whom?

17:11.904 --> 17:14.238
Well, she was stabbed,
right? That's intimate.

17:14.239 --> 17:16.674
The assailant was able
to walk right up to her.

17:16.675 --> 17:19.609
The wounds being everywhere
except her face, uh,

17:19.611 --> 17:22.445
that suggests a preexisting
history with the killer.

17:22.446 --> 17:26.117
Or, judging by the depth
and placement of the wounds,

17:26.117 --> 17:27.785
killers.

17:29.521 --> 17:34.025
Moll Dyer was murdered by the
other two members of her coven.

17:34.026 --> 17:35.826
And you have your first lead.

17:35.827 --> 17:37.528
Hey, don't pop the champagne yet.

17:37.529 --> 17:39.463
If this isn't a one-time
crime of passion,

17:39.464 --> 17:41.732
they will kill again.

17:43.368 --> 17:44.669
Charlie, it's me.

17:44.670 --> 17:46.137
I need an APB on female suspects

17:46.138 --> 17:47.705
with a unique tattoo.

17:47.706 --> 17:49.807
I'm sending it to you now.

17:54.046 --> 17:57.815
So much has changed in
these last 300 years, sister.

18:01.386 --> 18:05.356
And it appears that much has not.

18:05.357 --> 18:06.757
Hello there, ladies.

18:06.758 --> 18:08.926
Do we have any plans for the evening?

18:08.927 --> 18:11.862
Listen, my buddy and I here,
we have access to this exclusive

18:11.863 --> 18:15.299
black-tie Beltway thingy.
Are you interested?

18:15.300 --> 18:16.701
Make up a name.

18:16.702 --> 18:18.235
That way she can't find you tomorrow.

18:18.236 --> 18:19.904
Tell my wife I have
to stay late at work.

18:19.905 --> 18:21.659
I wonder how many drinks they've had.

18:21.660 --> 18:23.683
They totally believe us...
Have to make sure she...

18:23.684 --> 18:26.744
Sister, what do you
think of our suitors?

18:26.745 --> 18:29.747
I think they stink of lies.

18:29.748 --> 18:32.650
Lies they use to hide their betrayals.

18:35.253 --> 18:37.488
These two have wives

18:37.489 --> 18:39.490
and children at home.

18:39.491 --> 18:42.126
Loved ones they betray
by spending their nights

18:42.127 --> 18:44.528
with woman after woman.

18:44.529 --> 18:46.864
I think it's time we
taught them the error

18:46.865 --> 18:48.866
of their ways.

18:48.867 --> 18:50.201
With wicked tongue,

18:50.202 --> 18:51.035
the serpent lied

18:51.036 --> 18:52.870
and took their liberty.

18:52.871 --> 18:55.014
Through poison words,
the world knew sin.

18:55.015 --> 18:57.141
Our hand will set you free.

19:09.121 --> 19:12.123
This city truly is a modern marvel.

19:12.124 --> 19:14.825
Pretty special.

19:14.826 --> 19:16.861
Iconic architecture on every corner.

19:16.862 --> 19:18.562
Oh, it's not simply the buildings,

19:18.563 --> 19:20.931
but the promise they hold.

19:20.932 --> 19:23.334
It is the beating heart of democracy.

19:23.335 --> 19:25.369
A forum for public discourse

19:25.370 --> 19:27.872
and the intricacies of the rule of law.

19:27.873 --> 19:29.774
Yards of beer.

19:29.775 --> 19:31.976
Well, once the case is closed,

19:31.977 --> 19:34.879
present your second and name the place.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.114
Why do you know so much
about witches anyway?

19:38.050 --> 19:41.018
I was married to one.

19:41.019 --> 19:42.453
Let me guess...

19:42.454 --> 19:44.855
Everything was great,

19:44.856 --> 19:47.058
until it wasn't.

19:47.059 --> 19:49.593
Mm.

19:51.530 --> 19:54.532
And young Miss Molly's father?

19:56.601 --> 19:58.669
Ah.

19:58.670 --> 20:00.938
Raising a daughter alone

20:00.939 --> 20:02.773
cannot be easy.

20:02.774 --> 20:05.209
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

20:07.212 --> 20:09.947
This phase of hers,

20:09.948 --> 20:13.851
the sudden silence, is there
a history of it in the family?

20:13.852 --> 20:16.120
Not that I know of.

20:16.121 --> 20:18.522
And she's such a talker, too. She...

20:18.523 --> 20:21.625
To anyone... adults, kids
her own age, even strangers.

20:21.626 --> 20:23.828
She always has something to say.

20:23.829 --> 20:26.831
Two weeks ago, she just stopped.

20:31.069 --> 20:34.672
Huh. APB just got a hit on
a crime scene across town.

20:52.061 --> 20:54.475
The girl from the vision
is Diane's daughter?

20:54.476 --> 20:55.976
So it would seem.

20:55.977 --> 20:58.178
She...

20:58.179 --> 21:01.248
she may hold some manner of message

21:01.249 --> 21:03.851
that could aid us in our
quest to find the next Witness.

21:03.852 --> 21:05.252
Crane,

21:05.253 --> 21:07.021
I don't think she holds anything.

21:07.022 --> 21:08.656
I think she is the message.

21:08.657 --> 21:10.391
I've been going over some

21:10.392 --> 21:12.266
of the more complicated translations.

21:12.267 --> 21:14.187
It turns out the ritual
wasn't used to track down

21:14.188 --> 21:15.452
the next Dalai Lama, but rather

21:15.453 --> 21:17.197
to reveal who would

21:17.198 --> 21:19.166
next bear the mantle
of his responsibility.

21:19.167 --> 21:22.069
Molly is the next Witness.

21:23.505 --> 21:24.838
The Witness is a kid.

21:24.839 --> 21:26.473
How is that even possible?

21:26.474 --> 21:27.977
What are we supposed to do with that?

21:27.978 --> 21:30.077
That one so young

21:30.078 --> 21:33.180
would be thrust into
so fraught a destiny.

21:33.181 --> 21:34.848
Everything okay?

21:34.849 --> 21:36.650
Uh, yes. Yes, of course.

21:36.651 --> 21:38.886
I was merely conversing with Miss Jenny

21:38.887 --> 21:40.988
- with regards to, um...
- Go sports, Crane.

21:40.989 --> 21:43.023
- Sports.
- Knicks' new draft pick.

21:43.024 --> 21:45.808
Nick. Nick has just been
picked for the new draft,

21:45.809 --> 21:48.110
which is superlative news.

21:48.111 --> 21:49.912
I'm a great admirer of-of his sporting.

21:49.913 --> 21:51.914
Nice try, Crane. I'll talk to you later.

21:51.915 --> 21:53.715
Uh, yep. Bye-bye.

21:53.716 --> 21:56.051
I, uh, never pegged
you for a sports fan.

21:56.052 --> 22:00.088
Well, my tastes are
nothing if not eclectic.

22:00.089 --> 22:01.957
So, was this the work of our witches?

22:01.958 --> 22:03.926
An eyewitness

22:03.927 --> 22:05.627
said these two young,

22:05.628 --> 22:06.595
attractive women

22:06.596 --> 22:08.130
fled the scene.

22:08.131 --> 22:10.933
Indeed, they would appear
young to the naked eye.

22:10.934 --> 22:15.003
Glamour is a magic that
predates modern technology.

22:15.004 --> 22:17.387
So that's why my phone and
these cameras can see through it?

22:17.388 --> 22:20.042
Precisely.

22:20.043 --> 22:22.144
This is a classic escalation pattern.

22:22.145 --> 22:23.579
And there you have it.

22:23.580 --> 22:26.315
Witches with a taste for lies

22:26.316 --> 22:29.585
and a need to uncover betrayal
are loose in our capital city.

22:29.586 --> 22:32.754
A hotbed of dishonesty and backstabbing.

22:32.755 --> 22:35.424
You know witches. What's the play?

22:35.425 --> 22:37.693
Uh... we must uncover their scent.

22:37.694 --> 22:42.130
Theoretically, Glamour requires
time and energy to maintain.

22:42.131 --> 22:46.234
No doubt, our Witches Gone
Wild will need to revivify.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.872
I've never seen gingerbread
houses on Zillow,

22:49.873 --> 22:51.640
so how do we find them?

22:51.641 --> 22:54.142
All right, the only
evidence a Moll Dyer existed

22:54.143 --> 22:56.345
is from a local immigration record filed

22:56.346 --> 22:59.348
by a ship's captain named Thomas Taylor.

22:59.349 --> 23:01.984
The only thing is it
wasn't just Moll's name.

23:01.985 --> 23:04.319
Uh, there were two
other names under "Dyer."

23:04.320 --> 23:06.521
A Marg and Malligo.

23:06.522 --> 23:08.657
So three Dyer sisters total.

23:08.658 --> 23:11.593
The next step is to
consult the Secret Histories

23:11.594 --> 23:14.263
on their precise relationship
with General Washington.

23:14.264 --> 23:16.465
There may be a clue as to
where they lay their heads.

23:16.466 --> 23:19.651
Already on it. See,
Washington paid the Dyers

23:19.652 --> 23:21.753
for uncovering John Andre's treachery

23:21.754 --> 23:24.055
with a plot of land.

23:24.056 --> 23:25.590
A pretty big one,

23:25.591 --> 23:27.592
protected in perpetuity by the Fed,

23:27.593 --> 23:30.094
- way out off of Route 50.
- That's where Moll Dyer's body

23:30.095 --> 23:31.663
was found in the first place.

23:31.664 --> 23:34.966
There may have been something we missed.

23:34.967 --> 23:37.302
Capital work, Master Wells.

23:38.637 --> 23:39.771
Okay,

23:39.772 --> 23:41.339
I just need to make a quick pit stop

23:41.340 --> 23:42.573
on the way to the wetlands.

23:51.383 --> 23:52.984
Don't be fooled by his, uh,

23:52.985 --> 23:55.620
genteel accent and all the bowing.

23:55.621 --> 23:57.822
There's more to Crane
than he's letting on.

23:59.158 --> 24:03.161
Okay, I-I see what's going on here.

24:03.162 --> 24:04.896
You're just jelly

24:04.897 --> 24:08.333
because, uh, teacher didn't
give you a gold star, too.

24:08.334 --> 24:10.401
Hmm?

24:10.402 --> 24:12.470
You know how I like
to take machines apart

24:12.471 --> 24:13.805
to see how they work?

24:13.806 --> 24:16.674
- Mm-hmm.
- Same thing goes for people.

24:16.675 --> 24:20.311
That accent... "Capital
work, Master Wells"...

24:20.312 --> 24:23.648
anachronistic inflection and syntax.

24:23.649 --> 24:25.817
- That jacket, those boots.
- It's a choice.

24:25.818 --> 24:29.187
He's living la vida
lifestyle from a simpler time.

24:29.188 --> 24:32.957
His name appears in recorded
history only before 1781.

24:32.958 --> 24:36.527
1781. Then he disappears without a trace

24:36.528 --> 24:40.732
until he shows up again in
Sleepy Hollow three years ago.

24:40.733 --> 24:42.834
Okay, so there has to
be more than one person

24:42.835 --> 24:45.069
named Ichabod Crane in
all of human history, Alex.

24:45.070 --> 24:46.871
I checked with Interpol

24:46.872 --> 24:50.575
and the FBI and every genealogy
Web site I could subscribe to.

24:51.777 --> 24:53.778
He's the only Ichabod.

24:53.779 --> 24:55.213
Period.

25:00.419 --> 25:02.086
Do you think...?

25:02.087 --> 25:03.955
He's a time traveler.

25:03.956 --> 25:05.957
He is a time travel...

25:05.958 --> 25:07.292
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:07.293 --> 25:08.926
How would you even build

25:08.927 --> 25:10.295
a time machine in 1781?

25:10.296 --> 25:12.797
Out of whale blubber and wooden teeth?

25:12.798 --> 25:15.433
I don't know what his deal is.

25:15.434 --> 25:17.135
Not yet.

25:17.136 --> 25:19.137
But just keep your eyes peeled.

25:19.138 --> 25:21.773
Ichabod Crane is keeping secrets.

25:24.510 --> 25:26.878
Is that her?

25:28.881 --> 25:30.982
Yeah, that's her.

25:46.398 --> 25:47.965
Hey.

25:47.966 --> 25:49.567
It's the quiet girl.

25:49.568 --> 25:51.035
This an attention thing?

25:51.036 --> 25:52.937
Or just a really stupid way

25:52.938 --> 25:54.278
to try and get out of homework?

25:58.110 --> 26:00.044
Bet she can cry real loud though.

26:00.913 --> 26:03.114
Hey!

26:03.115 --> 26:04.682
How about we even the odds?

26:09.455 --> 26:10.755
Mean girls.

26:14.660 --> 26:15.860
You okay?

26:15.861 --> 26:17.962
Here, come on.

26:22.034 --> 26:24.535
This'll just take a second.

26:31.176 --> 26:32.410
What the hell?

26:32.411 --> 26:34.579
Molly.

26:34.580 --> 26:35.847
Oh, my God.

26:35.848 --> 26:37.081
What happened?

26:37.082 --> 26:39.183
You okay?

26:40.085 --> 26:42.253
Did you do this?

26:42.254 --> 26:43.855
No, no, I, I just got...

26:43.856 --> 26:45.256
Why are you even here?

26:45.257 --> 26:46.290
Uh...

26:46.291 --> 26:47.458
I, uh...

26:47.459 --> 26:48.926
Crane asked about Molly,

26:48.927 --> 26:50.928
you two have a little phone conversation

26:50.929 --> 26:52.463
and then you just show up here?!

26:52.464 --> 26:54.098
Just let me explain.

26:54.099 --> 26:56.300
You two come into my life...

27:00.666 --> 27:02.009
I hardly know him

27:02.010 --> 27:03.808
and I sure as hell do not know you.

27:03.809 --> 27:04.775
Hello.

27:11.216 --> 27:12.717
Honey?

27:12.718 --> 27:14.852
Oh, my God.

27:18.546 --> 27:20.608
I was on the green bench.

27:20.609 --> 27:22.009
Where you always hid away.

27:22.065 --> 27:24.632
You were late and these two girls

27:24.633 --> 27:26.067
from the eighth grade...

27:26.068 --> 27:28.469
mm, they were being really mean,

27:28.470 --> 27:29.804
and one of them pushed me

27:29.805 --> 27:31.072
and that's what happened.

27:31.073 --> 27:32.940
I'm sorry.

27:34.944 --> 27:37.278
You have nothing to
be sorry about, okay?

27:37.279 --> 27:38.780
And, hey, we got through it

27:38.781 --> 27:41.115
together, like always.

27:41.116 --> 27:43.885
Okay?

27:46.956 --> 27:49.223
You really need to get
back to work, don't you?

27:49.224 --> 27:51.826
My case is not closed.

27:54.296 --> 27:56.130
Okay.

27:56.131 --> 27:59.100
I will be home as soon
as humanly possible.

27:59.101 --> 28:01.102
Mm, it's okay, Mom.

28:01.103 --> 28:03.037
It's really okay.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.241
Come here.

28:06.243 --> 28:08.844
Oh, baby.

28:08.845 --> 28:11.279
You better still be talking
by the time I get home.

28:11.281 --> 28:12.448
I promise.

28:15.853 --> 28:17.220
I'm sorry.

28:18.155 --> 28:19.291
When we figured out that

28:19.292 --> 28:20.656
that little girl had inherited

28:20.657 --> 28:22.658
Abbie's responsibility, I...

28:22.659 --> 28:24.360
I needed to see her.

28:24.361 --> 28:26.195
She's not Abbie.

28:26.196 --> 28:28.931
I know that.

28:28.932 --> 28:30.733
Believe me, I do.

28:32.202 --> 28:34.337
My sister being a Witness

28:34.338 --> 28:36.205
tore my family apart.

28:36.206 --> 28:37.888
We need to help Diana

28:37.889 --> 28:39.709
and her daughter understand this.

28:39.710 --> 28:42.211
Get through it.

28:42.212 --> 28:43.946
Agreed.

28:46.049 --> 28:47.850
But how?

28:49.520 --> 28:51.691
How does one bring an innocent child

28:51.692 --> 28:54.494
into the battle between good and evil?

28:56.063 --> 28:59.199
Probably not by just
showing up at her school.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.600
Crane.

29:02.236 --> 29:03.582
You said you had an explanation.

29:03.583 --> 29:05.071
Let's hear it.

29:05.072 --> 29:06.706
Agent Thomas, you have our apologies.

29:06.707 --> 29:08.808
We fully understand

29:08.809 --> 29:10.543
your concern in finding Miss Jenny here.

29:10.544 --> 29:14.014
The truth is we were
concerned for her safety.

29:14.015 --> 29:16.349
The people who took Crane
and released that Booth demon

29:16.350 --> 29:17.684
are still out there somewhere.

29:17.685 --> 29:19.350
I thought I would do
a sweep at this place

29:19.351 --> 29:21.214
and make sure no one had
eyes on your daughter,

29:21.215 --> 29:23.156
but I overstepped my bounds.

29:23.157 --> 29:24.157
I am sorry.

29:24.158 --> 29:25.592
You should have asked.

29:27.194 --> 29:28.962
Understand?

29:30.831 --> 29:32.298
Then let's go find these witches

29:32.299 --> 29:33.933
and put them down so I can go home.

29:42.043 --> 29:44.411
Any sign of a witch lair?

29:44.412 --> 29:46.913
It's nothing but swamp for miles.

29:49.617 --> 29:51.718
All right.

29:51.719 --> 29:54.053
Moll Dyer's body lay here.

29:56.557 --> 29:58.958
Must have just killed
her and dumped her.

30:07.535 --> 30:10.336
Right on their own doorstep.

30:12.740 --> 30:14.007
There's nothing here, Crane.

30:15.876 --> 30:18.645
The Glamour not only
hid the Dyer sisters'

30:18.646 --> 30:21.548
true appearance...

30:21.549 --> 30:23.516
but their dwellings, as well.

30:25.019 --> 30:26.452
Come.

30:27.388 --> 30:28.755
Our witch hunt

30:28.756 --> 30:30.490
is nearing its conclusion.

30:39.533 --> 30:42.769
A body was dragged through here.

30:42.770 --> 30:45.405
Most likely Moll Dyer's.

30:47.108 --> 30:48.641
Check the place?

30:48.642 --> 30:50.777
Yes.

30:50.778 --> 30:52.378
Be wary.

30:55.349 --> 30:56.750
So...

30:56.751 --> 30:58.017
said you were gonna sweep

30:58.018 --> 30:59.986
my daughter's school.

30:59.987 --> 31:02.889
Don't tell me you work security.

31:04.658 --> 31:06.493
Well, I've dealt

31:06.494 --> 31:09.429
with all kinds of security systems.

31:09.430 --> 31:11.464
Ugh, great.

31:11.465 --> 31:14.400
I am in an invisible witch house

31:14.401 --> 31:16.970
with a B&E artist

31:16.971 --> 31:19.139
and a guy wearing knee-high boots

31:19.140 --> 31:22.375
with a crossbow.

31:22.376 --> 31:25.745
We are uniquely equipped to
deal with supernatural threats.

31:25.746 --> 31:27.480
This room's yours.

31:42.363 --> 31:44.197
From the size and shape,

31:44.198 --> 31:46.266
I think we're looking
at the murder weapon.

31:49.503 --> 31:51.037
The Dagger of Z'urn D'oragh.

31:51.038 --> 31:52.272
It's beautiful.

31:53.607 --> 31:55.608
No, no, don't touch.

31:55.609 --> 31:57.443
One cut and you're toast.

32:01.148 --> 32:03.216
I don't think anyone's home.

32:03.217 --> 32:07.020
And yet the Glamour on
the house remains in place.

32:07.021 --> 32:08.755
I'll warrant that the Dyer sisters

32:08.756 --> 32:12.325
are in possession of
an Infernal Machine.

32:12.326 --> 32:14.093
Let me guess? More magic?

32:14.094 --> 32:15.962
It's a witch thing.

32:17.832 --> 32:20.200
A mundane object

32:20.201 --> 32:22.335
powered up with their magic

32:22.336 --> 32:25.371
can keep a spell alive for a long time.

32:26.874 --> 32:29.209
So, we disable it,

32:29.210 --> 32:30.343
we disable them?

32:30.344 --> 32:31.511
It could weaken them

32:31.512 --> 32:32.946
or it could whip them

32:32.947 --> 32:34.147
into a killing frenzy.

32:35.149 --> 32:36.683
50/50.

32:36.684 --> 32:37.717
Not bad odds.

32:37.718 --> 32:38.718
- No!
- No!

32:43.490 --> 32:44.991
What did I do?

32:44.992 --> 32:47.293
I doubt it is good.

32:52.681 --> 32:54.527
I think you tripped their
home security system.

32:54.528 --> 32:56.023
So, we... shut it off

32:57.203 --> 32:59.271
There must be a way to disable it.

33:03.776 --> 33:05.744
Agent Thomas!

33:05.745 --> 33:09.281
My sister will punish her
for sullying our property.

33:09.282 --> 33:10.549
Go and help her.

33:11.751 --> 33:13.685
Hmm.

33:17.590 --> 33:19.391
I know you.

33:19.392 --> 33:21.593
From many years ago.

33:21.594 --> 33:23.428
No.

33:23.429 --> 33:25.997
I doubt we run in the same circles.

33:26.933 --> 33:29.568
You're a liar, old man.

33:41.848 --> 33:44.115
You spoiled our night out.

33:48.254 --> 33:49.955
We were painting the town

33:49.956 --> 33:51.790
a deep, dark...

33:51.791 --> 33:53.959
red.

33:56.629 --> 33:58.864
You like lies?

33:58.865 --> 34:01.867
I lie to myself daily.

34:01.868 --> 34:04.870
Tell myself I know who I am,

34:04.871 --> 34:06.037
what I'm doing,

34:06.038 --> 34:08.940
where my life is going.

34:08.940 --> 34:10.742
The truth.

34:12.210 --> 34:14.146
How refreshing.

34:20.018 --> 34:21.786
But still...

34:21.788 --> 34:24.956
you ruined our fun.

34:29.996 --> 34:31.429
Ah.

34:31.429 --> 34:33.697
Yes.

34:33.699 --> 34:36.742
You're one of Washington's men,

34:36.743 --> 34:39.645
in service, like us,

34:39.646 --> 34:42.581
to the one who trapped us here,

34:42.581 --> 34:45.284
guarding his damnable treasure.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.885
I know nothing of your treasure.

34:46.886 --> 34:50.456
But whatever noble deed
you did, you have long since

34:50.456 --> 34:51.657
lost your way.

34:57.697 --> 35:00.132
Your heart is full of lies.

35:00.133 --> 35:02.367
Lies of omission,

35:02.368 --> 35:04.937
lies about...

35:06.339 --> 35:07.973
...a little girl.

35:07.974 --> 35:10.175
Well, no more lies

35:10.176 --> 35:12.845
once your tongue
slithers from your mouth.

35:12.846 --> 35:15.080
With wicked tongue, the serpent lied

35:15.081 --> 35:16.415
and took their liberty.

35:16.416 --> 35:18.183
Through poison words,
the world knew sin...

35:20.353 --> 35:21.987
No!

35:38.505 --> 35:40.205
You good?

35:40.206 --> 35:42.074
I'm not gonna lie.

35:42.075 --> 35:43.675
I don't like witches.

36:07.233 --> 36:09.201
I need a minute.

36:19.913 --> 36:21.380
How did she fare?

36:21.381 --> 36:23.081
Well enough.

36:24.651 --> 36:26.118
She can handle this.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.888
Well, then that settles it.

36:31.958 --> 36:34.393
Tonight...

36:34.394 --> 36:36.795
we'll tell her the
truth about her daughter.

36:40.359 --> 36:42.557
I went back to the
house to take a closer

36:42.558 --> 36:46.393
an Infernal Machine and,
um, yeah, I found this

36:46.394 --> 36:49.062
in what was left.

36:49.063 --> 36:51.665
There are two documents in there

36:51.666 --> 36:53.733
dated October 2, 1780.

36:53.734 --> 36:56.002
- And...
- The day John Andre was hanged

36:56.003 --> 36:58.939
and the day Washington
promised the Dyer sisters

36:58.940 --> 37:00.307
their plot of land.

37:00.308 --> 37:03.176
The other one is dated 1781,

37:03.177 --> 37:04.611
also from Washington,

37:04.612 --> 37:06.212
when he charged them with standing watch

37:06.236 --> 37:07.547
over a talisman.

37:07.548 --> 37:09.015
I searched the house, top to bottom,

37:09.016 --> 37:10.217
and I couldn't find it.

37:10.218 --> 37:11.905
One of the witches mentioned a treasure

37:11.906 --> 37:14.184
they'd been tasked with protecting.

37:15.534 --> 37:19.004
"The plot will be yours in perpetuity

37:19.005 --> 37:20.404
"so long as it

37:20.405 --> 37:22.342
"remains safe.

37:22.563 --> 37:24.431
The Division must endure."

37:24.432 --> 37:27.500
Hmm, see, after I cracked that
little bit of Franklin's code,

37:27.501 --> 37:29.236
I recognized some of the cipher

37:29.237 --> 37:31.071
from somewhere else.

37:31.072 --> 37:33.578
These are from the crypt where
the Booth demon was caged.

37:33.579 --> 37:34.307
Yep.

37:34.308 --> 37:36.343
"The Division must endure."

37:36.344 --> 37:38.278
So, the two events were connected.

37:38.279 --> 37:39.546
"The Division"...

37:39.547 --> 37:42.015
that sounds like a spy outfit.

37:42.016 --> 37:44.985
If the Division used the
Dyer sisters to stand watch

37:44.986 --> 37:47.854
over some manner of arcane artifact,

37:47.855 --> 37:49.956
it stands to reason

37:49.957 --> 37:51.991
that the Booth demon was doing the same.

37:54.061 --> 37:56.730
Someone is unleashing unspeakable evils

37:56.731 --> 37:59.132
as a means of procuring
mystical artifacts.

37:59.133 --> 38:02.168
Whom and to what end?

38:02.169 --> 38:03.169
Great questions

38:03.170 --> 38:04.371
for tomorrow

38:04.372 --> 38:05.772
when I promise I will help you

38:05.773 --> 38:07.276
hit the ground running, but right now

38:07.277 --> 38:08.708
my little girl's waiting for me.

38:08.709 --> 38:10.009
All right.

38:13.014 --> 38:16.850
Time... traveler.

38:31.465 --> 38:33.433
Breakfast for dinner?

38:33.434 --> 38:34.567
Oh!

38:34.568 --> 38:35.735
Your favorite.

38:35.736 --> 38:37.370
Perfect.

38:37.371 --> 38:38.838
That's it.

38:38.839 --> 38:41.674
From now on, you're
making dinner every night.

39:03.030 --> 39:05.298
I don't know what it was.

39:06.834 --> 39:10.136
Why I didn't want to say anything.

39:10.137 --> 39:15.642
I... I just felt strange.

39:15.643 --> 39:17.610
Like...

39:17.611 --> 39:21.514
like a shadow walked over my shadow...

39:21.515 --> 39:24.184
like a friend

39:24.185 --> 39:27.086
was... gone.

39:38.265 --> 39:41.034
We're not gonna tell
them tonight, are we?

39:42.937 --> 39:44.971
You know me so well, Miss Jenny.

39:49.510 --> 39:52.145
Molly is the next Witness.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.514
Diana deserves to know

39:54.515 --> 39:56.649
what that means...

39:56.650 --> 39:58.351
for their present and their future.

40:00.254 --> 40:02.088
But not tonight.

40:03.924 --> 40:06.626
Mother and daughter deserve
at least one night's peace.

40:33.487 --> 40:35.155
Ah...

40:35.156 --> 40:38.758
I spent months fine-tuning
the lighting in here.

40:38.759 --> 40:42.195
We still don't have it quite right.

40:43.264 --> 40:45.365
What about track lighting?

40:48.936 --> 40:50.337
What do you mean?

40:50.338 --> 40:54.307
Super '90s style, little bulbs on rails?

40:54.308 --> 40:57.644
You philistine.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.581
So...

41:01.582 --> 41:05.952
where are we on finding
Ichabod Crane's compatriot?

41:05.953 --> 41:07.487
He's headed this way

41:07.488 --> 41:11.191
and if his reputation holds true...

41:11.192 --> 41:13.793
death and destruction will follow.

41:38.021 --> 41:41.875
