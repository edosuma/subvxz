WEBVTT

00:01.008 --> 00:03.010
Previously on "Pretty Little Liars".

00:03.044 --> 00:04.912
This dress is the black swan.

00:04.946 --> 00:06.180
She's leaving.
Hurry!

00:06.214 --> 00:08.015
Spencer: If the black swan
wasn't guilty of something,

00:08.048 --> 00:09.149
why would she run
from you guys?

00:09.184 --> 00:10.751
I thought that we had a deal

00:10.785 --> 00:11.818
about you not coming out here.

00:11.853 --> 00:12.886
What was I supposed
to tell you?

00:12.921 --> 00:13.887
The truth?

00:13.922 --> 00:15.055
Spencer:
Somebody took you there

00:15.090 --> 00:17.091
to make it look like
you dug up Ali's body.

00:18.126 --> 00:20.027
"Game on, bitches."

00:20.061 --> 00:21.929
All: "-A."

00:21.963 --> 00:22.963
Wow, Jenna.

00:22.997 --> 00:24.932
All this time you could see.

00:24.966 --> 00:26.800
It was the only
protection I had.

00:26.835 --> 00:29.036
I'm sorry. Maybe I'll hear that
from your father tomorrow too.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.904
You're seeing him?
We have lunch plans.

00:30.939 --> 00:32.238
I guess I have you
to thank for that.

00:32.273 --> 00:33.774
Spencer, did you
call the hospital?

00:33.808 --> 00:34.775
Are they sending the records?

00:34.809 --> 00:35.476
There aren't any records.

00:35.510 --> 00:36.810
What's that supposed to mean?

00:36.845 --> 00:38.912
It means Melissa didn't
lose her baby in June.

00:38.947 --> 00:40.948
You're big on games,
but get this straight:

00:40.982 --> 00:42.182
Do not not mess with Hanna.

00:42.217 --> 00:44.818
( Screams )

00:44.853 --> 00:46.954
I've decided to defend
Garrett Reynolds.

00:46.988 --> 00:48.856
This is the man who
killed my best friend.

00:48.890 --> 00:50.891
He killed the girl Emily
was in love with.

00:50.925 --> 00:53.127
Accused of killing him.

00:54.162 --> 00:57.164
♪

00:57.198 --> 01:00.234
Do we really believe that Jenna
was off on a joyride that night?

01:00.268 --> 01:02.970
It was her plan to take Emily
to Ali's grave all along.

01:03.004 --> 01:04.938
Seemed to me like she
was scared of someone.

01:04.973 --> 01:07.207
And it seemed like she
was blind for five months

01:07.242 --> 01:08.809
when she wasn't.

01:08.843 --> 01:10.210
For purposes of my head
not exploding,

01:10.245 --> 01:11.912
could we just say that she
is telling the truth?

01:11.946 --> 01:12.980
Well, that would
mean that we would

01:13.014 --> 01:15.749
cross her off the new "A" list.

01:15.783 --> 01:16.950
Then who's still on it?

01:16.985 --> 01:17.951
Lucas?

01:17.986 --> 01:19.019
No way.

01:19.053 --> 01:20.187
He might be
a little unhinged lately,

01:20.221 --> 01:22.222
but he's not capable
of digging up a grave.

01:22.257 --> 01:25.025
Guys, all roads lead back
to the black swan.

01:25.059 --> 01:27.060
We know that she was
working with Mona,

01:27.095 --> 01:29.163
the sketches were in her lair.

01:29.197 --> 01:31.965
Spencer, mom wants to know
if you want anything else.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.101
Uh, no. Thank you, mom.

01:34.135 --> 01:36.803
Melissa looks great.

01:36.838 --> 01:39.106
Yeah, she's back to
being size too skinny.

01:40.775 --> 01:43.944
Black swan skinny?
Think about it.

01:43.978 --> 01:46.113
We know that she lied about
when she lost her baby.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.214
Whoa, back up.

01:47.248 --> 01:48.882
You think that she
was pretending

01:48.917 --> 01:50.017
to be pregnant for that long?

01:50.051 --> 01:51.051
No. That's, like, months.

01:51.085 --> 01:52.119
There's no way.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.954
She wouldn't do that
to my parents.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.088
Who else could it be?

01:55.123 --> 01:56.790
Mona started talking again,

01:56.824 --> 01:58.959
so maybe she can give
me some answers.

02:01.129 --> 02:03.897
Did you really think you
could avoid me forever?

02:03.932 --> 02:05.766
How could you defend Garrett?

02:05.800 --> 02:08.702
Let's not have this
conversation here.

02:08.735 --> 02:10.137
Oh, it doesn't bother you that
he murdered my sister?

02:10.170 --> 02:12.906
Look, I understand you're upset,
but this isn't the place.

02:12.941 --> 02:14.107
Just tell me why
you're doing it.

02:16.177 --> 02:19.146
Everyone deserves
a competent legal defense.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.914
You sure that's
the only reason?

02:23.184 --> 02:25.986
Let the process
play out, Jason.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.088
Focus on taking care
of your family

02:28.122 --> 02:29.189
and yourself.

02:29.224 --> 02:33.060
Don't worry. I am.

02:38.066 --> 02:41.134
Jason? Are you okay?

02:41.169 --> 02:44.204
No. But I will be.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.048
( Cell phones chime )

02:56.985 --> 03:00.787

Mom.

03:43.831 --> 03:46.667
Have you seen this?

03:46.701 --> 03:48.068
It's hard not to.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.003
He's plastered them
all over town.

03:50.038 --> 03:51.872
Do you think that he's
gonna get any calls?

03:51.906 --> 03:55.942
Tons. Mostly from people trying
to scam him out of his money.

03:55.977 --> 03:59.079
Well, if he finds the
person that dug up the body,

03:59.113 --> 04:00.747
what's gonna happen to them?

04:00.782 --> 04:01.948
Stealing a body's a felony,

04:01.983 --> 04:04.951
so they'd go to jail
for at least ten years.

04:04.986 --> 04:07.721
And they'd probably get a life
sentence for killing Allison.

04:07.755 --> 04:10.924
Wait. So now you're
convinced Garrett's innocent?

04:10.958 --> 04:12.859
No, I'm saying it'll be
easy to build a case

04:12.894 --> 04:14.761
against a person
who took the body.

04:18.833 --> 04:20.733
Not only did my dad
get a new haircut,

04:20.767 --> 04:22.869
but he's also wearing
a new aftershave.

04:22.904 --> 04:25.639
Soun like he's
got a date to me.

04:25.673 --> 04:27.808
He smells like baby wipes.

04:27.842 --> 04:28.875
Does your mom know?

04:28.910 --> 04:30.077
No.

04:30.111 --> 04:31.945
It's one thing to say
he's going out on a date,

04:31.979 --> 04:34.047
it's another to say
that it's with Meredith.

04:34.082 --> 04:35.749
Hey, you.

04:35.783 --> 04:37.918
It's better she hears it
from you than someone else.

04:47.929 --> 04:48.995
Hey.

04:49.030 --> 04:51.898
Hey. Are you on
your way home?

04:51.933 --> 04:53.834
Yeah. I thought we
could do dinner.

04:53.868 --> 04:55.702
Oh, well.
You're looking at it.

04:55.737 --> 04:57.104
I have a pile of essays
to get through.

04:57.138 --> 04:59.639
Oh. Okay.

04:59.674 --> 05:00.774
Tomorrow night?

05:00.808 --> 05:01.975
Well, don't tell anybody,

05:02.009 --> 05:05.712
but I will have some
pop quizzes to grade.

05:05.747 --> 05:07.781
But I'm home all weekend, so,

05:07.815 --> 05:09.583
rain check for Sunday?

05:09.617 --> 05:11.885
Yeah, sure.

05:11.919 --> 05:14.855
Didn't you stay in
last weekend though?

05:14.889 --> 05:17.824
Don't you just wanna go out,
be around people?

05:17.859 --> 05:21.995
I am around people.
All day, Monday through Friday.

05:22.029 --> 05:23.964
Yeah, teenagers.

05:23.998 --> 05:26.933
You should call up some friends.
Go have a girls night out.

05:26.968 --> 05:29.770
And who would that be?
All my friends have husbands.

05:29.804 --> 05:33.073
Besides, I'd much rather spend
a quiet night alone with you.

05:34.842 --> 05:36.676
Unless you have plans.

05:36.711 --> 05:39.679
That's not it.
I just...

05:39.714 --> 05:40.981
what?

05:41.015 --> 05:43.784
Nothing.

05:43.818 --> 05:45.919
I'll see you Sunday.
Love you.

05:45.953 --> 05:47.888
Love you.

05:55.763 --> 05:57.898
Mona vanderwall isn't
allowed visitors.

05:57.932 --> 05:59.766
Since when?

05:59.801 --> 06:00.967
Since the doctor ordered it.

06:01.002 --> 06:03.770
Well, I've been visiting her
for the past few weeks,

06:03.805 --> 06:04.905
so there must be a mistake.

06:04.939 --> 06:06.640
No mistake.

06:06.674 --> 06:08.742
I'll just be a few minutes,
I promise.

06:12.713 --> 06:13.747
( Sighs )

06:13.781 --> 06:16.750
Fine. When can I see her?

06:16.784 --> 06:19.686
She's lost her
visitation privileges.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.555
Wait. Why? For how long?

06:21.589 --> 06:22.923
I have no idea.

06:28.863 --> 06:30.730
We don't do, like,
frappuccino's here.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.599
We do caramel cappuccinos,

06:32.633 --> 06:34.701
and then we have, like,
assorted americanos.

06:34.735 --> 06:37.737
You do know what an
americano is, don't you?

06:37.772 --> 06:39.673
Yeah. I know.

06:39.707 --> 06:43.643
Good, good. You are gonna be
a barista soon enough.

06:43.678 --> 06:45.779
Awesome.

06:47.048 --> 06:49.816
Make me proud.

06:56.724 --> 06:58.859
Are you Emily fields?

06:58.893 --> 07:00.794
Yes.

07:00.828 --> 07:03.897
I called your house and
your m said you worked here.

07:03.931 --> 07:05.665
I'm Maya's cousin, Nate.

07:05.700 --> 07:08.635
You have time to talk?

07:08.669 --> 07:11.004
Um...

07:13.674 --> 07:18.512
I'm sorry. It's my first day
here, so can I call you later?

07:18.546 --> 07:20.680
Yeah, any time.
I'll give you my number.

07:20.715 --> 07:22.516
I live here now.

07:22.550 --> 07:23.950
In Rosewood?

07:23.985 --> 07:25.819
Just started at Hollis.

07:25.853 --> 07:28.855
Maya never mentioned she had
a cousin coming to Hollis.

07:28.890 --> 07:32.559
Well, I applied but I hadn't
gotten in yet when she was...

07:35.763 --> 07:37.797
I was actually
really looking forward

07:37.832 --> 07:39.733
to hanging out with her again.

07:43.571 --> 07:45.605
Hey, Emily.
Go time.

07:46.974 --> 07:48.875
Talk to you soon.

07:50.711 --> 07:53.914
Green tea latte drinkers.

07:53.948 --> 07:55.949
Yeah? So get the gluten-free
biscottis going.

07:55.983 --> 07:59.786
Gluten-free biscottis.

08:01.589 --> 08:04.791
There's nothing else
you can do about it?

08:04.825 --> 08:06.893
Yeah, I understand.

08:06.928 --> 08:09.596
Um...

08:09.630 --> 08:13.500
I guess, just let me
know if anything changes.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.768
All right, thanks.

08:16.971 --> 08:20.807
Next Saturday.
You, me, the tenth row.

08:20.841 --> 08:23.610
Bon iver.

08:23.644 --> 08:24.978
Don't worry.

08:25.012 --> 08:26.746
I'll think of a way that
you can thank me later.

08:26.781 --> 08:28.582
Oh.

08:28.616 --> 08:29.950
Okay, this is the part where
you're supposed to scream,

08:29.984 --> 08:31.518
jump up and kiss me.

08:31.552 --> 08:32.485
What's going on?

08:32.520 --> 08:33.820
I just got off
the phone with wren

08:33.854 --> 08:35.655
and he told me that
Mona freaked out

08:35.690 --> 08:37.657
after some guy went to
visit her the other day.

08:37.692 --> 08:39.592
And now I can't
see her anymore.

08:39.626 --> 08:43.763
I mean, seriously,
I'm going to kill Lucas.

08:43.798 --> 08:47.834
It wasn't Lucas.
It was me.

08:47.868 --> 08:50.637
What?

08:50.671 --> 08:51.905
Why would you go
there without me?

08:51.939 --> 08:54.608
Because I needed
to talk to her.

08:54.642 --> 08:55.742
About what?

08:55.776 --> 08:58.511
Nothing. Much.

08:58.546 --> 08:59.779
Really.

08:59.814 --> 09:01.648
I told her to just
stop messing with you.

09:01.682 --> 09:02.749
Wait, messing with me?

09:02.783 --> 09:04.818
Yeah, before I knew it,
she was flipping tables

09:04.852 --> 09:06.519
and acting like she
was possessed.

09:06.554 --> 09:09.522
Mona is in radley under
24-hour supervision.

09:09.557 --> 09:11.725
All right? She's not doing
anything to hurt me.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.760
Yes, she is.
You just don't see it.

09:13.794 --> 09:15.895
You have to trust that
I know what I'm doing.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.598
Hanna, if you were
popping pills everyday,

09:18.633 --> 09:19.899
would you want me to
just look the other way?

09:19.934 --> 09:20.900
That's not the same thing.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.669
It is exactly the same thing.

09:22.703 --> 09:24.838
Wren thinks it's good
if I go talk to her.

09:24.872 --> 09:26.573
He said it's helping me heal.

09:26.607 --> 09:27.741
Why are you listening
to some guy you barely know,

09:27.775 --> 09:28.908
instead of me?

09:28.943 --> 09:31.544
Because I obviously can't
talk to you about this.

09:31.579 --> 09:33.613
You've already made up
your mind about Mona.

09:33.648 --> 09:36.583
Wren doesn't know
everything that I know.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.884
Unless there's something
that you're not telling me.

09:37.918 --> 09:39.586
No, of course not.

09:39.620 --> 09:40.854
Then you need to stay
away from radley.

09:40.888 --> 09:44.524
Look, I get that you're trying
to help me here, but you're not.

09:44.558 --> 09:45.959
So just do me a favor
and stay out of it.

09:55.002 --> 09:57.837
( Sighs )

10:03.808 --> 10:05.642
You both just need
a little time to cool off.

10:05.677 --> 10:07.878
Caleb's not gonna be
cooling off any time soon.

10:07.912 --> 10:10.781
He doesn't understand
why I need to see Mona,

10:10.815 --> 10:12.883
and it's killing me
not to tell him.

10:12.917 --> 10:13.984
Maybe you should.

10:14.018 --> 10:16.653
Maybe I should what?

10:16.688 --> 10:17.988
Tell him why
you're going there,

10:18.022 --> 10:21.592
and about this "A".

10:21.626 --> 10:23.694
Wait, are you serious?

10:23.728 --> 10:25.929
Look, if it were me,

10:25.964 --> 10:27.865
I would ezra about "A".

10:27.899 --> 10:29.032
I'd have to.

10:29.067 --> 10:30.701
( Sighs )

10:35.874 --> 10:37.941
Why are you looking at
pictures of bald, fat men?

10:37.976 --> 10:40.878
I'm looking for
a guy for my mom.

10:40.912 --> 10:43.814
I don't know, I just thought
she could try out online dating.

10:43.848 --> 10:47.851
She's divorced,
she's not desperate.

10:47.886 --> 10:52.823
You didn't tell your mom about
your dad and Meredith, did you?

10:52.857 --> 10:55.058
I just thought it would be
easier for her to hear

10:55.093 --> 10:56.960
if she had already
met someone else.

10:56.995 --> 10:58.662
Look, all right,
your mom's a catch.

10:58.696 --> 11:00.631
Okay? She can meet
someone in person.

11:00.665 --> 11:02.532
She doesn't have
to do it online.

11:02.567 --> 11:04.001
Hey, girls.

11:04.035 --> 11:06.770
Hey, mom.
Hi.

11:06.804 --> 11:09.606
Okay, what don't
you want me to see?

11:09.641 --> 11:10.607
Nothing.

11:10.642 --> 11:13.043
No more secrets, remember?

11:19.984 --> 11:21.818
Should I be worried?

11:21.853 --> 11:24.721
I'm trying to find
a guy for my mom.

11:24.756 --> 11:28.792
Yeah, preferably someone
who doesn't look like a grape.

11:31.930 --> 11:34.898
He's cute. Sort of.

11:35.967 --> 11:38.568
Mom, he has a unibrow.

11:38.603 --> 11:41.772
Tell your mom to use
mainlinemate.

11:41.806 --> 11:44.641
It's a much better site.

11:50.748 --> 11:53.083
( Applause )
All right, see you next week.

12:02.593 --> 12:04.561
Hey, Jason.
Hey.

12:04.595 --> 12:05.629
How's it going?

12:05.663 --> 12:06.763
I've been better.

12:06.798 --> 12:08.699
There any calls
on the flyer yet?

12:08.733 --> 12:10.801
Your mom send you here
to ask me that?

12:10.835 --> 12:12.602
Jason, you are upset.

12:12.637 --> 12:14.571
I want to make sure
that you're okay.

12:14.605 --> 12:15.906
Nothing solid
to go on just yet.

12:15.940 --> 12:17.874
Maybe you should
withdraw the reward.

12:17.909 --> 12:19.676
Just let the police
handle this.

12:19.711 --> 12:22.612
Why? Because they handled
Ali's murder case so well?

12:22.647 --> 12:24.014
No, because you don't
need to be fielding calls

12:24.048 --> 12:25.983
from every crackpot in town
who's just looking for money.

12:26.017 --> 12:28.919
Look, all I need is one
to tell me the truth.

12:28.953 --> 12:30.554
How are you gonna kvow
if they're for real

12:30.588 --> 12:31.588
or if they just want a reward?

12:31.622 --> 12:32.889
I can tell when
someone's lying.

12:32.924 --> 12:34.691
Can you?

12:34.726 --> 12:35.892
What is that supposed to mean?

12:35.927 --> 12:37.728
Why do you think your
mom took this case?

12:37.762 --> 12:41.898
'Cause she has a reason to
believe that Garrett's innocent.

12:41.933 --> 12:43.667
Or maybe she just
doesn't want to see

12:43.701 --> 12:45.635
the precious Hastings
name get tarnished.

12:45.670 --> 12:46.803
You think that she's
trying to protect someone?

12:46.838 --> 12:48.638
I think your mom has an agenda

12:48.673 --> 12:50.040
that has nothing to do with criminal defense.
( Phone buzzes )

12:50.074 --> 12:51.875
Are you talking about Melissa?

12:51.909 --> 12:54.845
I gotta take this.

12:54.879 --> 12:58.749
Yeah?

13:00.885 --> 13:02.886
Gourmet chef?

13:02.920 --> 13:04.755
What? She is in my house.

13:04.789 --> 13:05.722
Oh.

13:06.991 --> 13:08.925
Athletic?

13:08.960 --> 13:10.994
All right, does your mom even
own a pair of sneakers?

13:11.029 --> 13:12.929
Okay, everybody
exaggerates on this thing.

13:12.964 --> 13:14.831
I read it in <i>cosmo.</i>

13:14.866 --> 13:17.667
Sit down. Help me
figure out a username.

13:18.970 --> 13:20.737
Um...

13:20.772 --> 13:24.641
Oh! How 'bout
"Rosewoodgirl"?

13:24.675 --> 13:26.977
Lame.

13:27.011 --> 13:29.946
"Artlover"?
Boring.

13:33.951 --> 13:37.888
I got one.
"Hotmama".

13:37.922 --> 13:40.657
"Hotmama"?
Mm-hmm.

13:40.691 --> 13:43.794
I'm trying to get my mom a date
with a man, not a frat boy.

13:43.828 --> 13:47.731
Trust me, Aria.
This is going to work.

13:47.765 --> 13:51.068
Hotmama.

14:04.782 --> 14:07.617
Hi.

14:07.652 --> 14:08.952
Thanks for coming.

14:08.986 --> 14:12.689
Uh, so do you live on campus?

14:12.723 --> 14:14.825
I got a studio
near the college.

14:14.859 --> 14:16.626
Dorms aren't really my thing.

14:16.661 --> 14:17.961
Yeah.

14:20.598 --> 14:24.968
Maya sent me a picture of you.

14:26.971 --> 14:29.739
Yeah, I sent that to her
when she was at tru north.

14:29.774 --> 14:32.642
I know it's not their fault,

14:32.677 --> 14:34.744
but I keep thinking if her
parents hadn't threatened

14:34.779 --> 14:37.747
to send her back there,
she'd still be here.

14:37.782 --> 14:41.551
I sent her mom a few emails,
but she never responded to me.

14:41.586 --> 14:42.919
They're totally
shut down right now.

14:42.954 --> 14:45.021
It's all just too much.

14:45.056 --> 14:47.023
I was just hoping they'd have
some kind of service here.

14:47.058 --> 14:49.993
The funeral was small,
just family.

14:50.027 --> 14:53.663
Well, I never got
to say goodbye.

14:53.698 --> 14:56.733
That's sort of why I called.

14:56.767 --> 14:59.936
Maya's mom asked me
to give you this.

14:59.971 --> 15:03.673
It was delivered a few
weeks after the funeral.

15:25.563 --> 15:29.633
We saw this movie
on our first date.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.936
Actually, we didn't really
see that much of the movie.

15:32.970 --> 15:35.739
( Laughs ) Sounds like
my kind of first date.

16:05.937 --> 16:09.573
( Door buzzer )

16:09.607 --> 16:11.975
Hey, I understand you're a cop,

16:12.009 --> 16:14.544
but you still can't
go in there.

16:14.579 --> 16:16.646
Well, this court
order says I can.

16:18.683 --> 16:19.816
How long will you be?

16:19.850 --> 16:22.786
As long as it takes.

16:27.792 --> 16:29.859
( Door buzzer )

16:29.894 --> 16:32.662
Wilden: Hello, Mona.
Remember me?

16:35.967 --> 16:37.601
Maya said you were a swimmer.

16:37.740 --> 16:39.975
What's your stroke?
Butterfly? Free style?

16:40.009 --> 16:42.511
Free style. Yeah.
You swim?

16:42.545 --> 16:43.879
I was all-conference
in high school.

16:43.913 --> 16:45.647
Oh. Impressive.

16:45.681 --> 16:47.649
Swimming definitely
wasn't Maya's thing.

16:47.683 --> 16:48.984
Unless there were
floaties involved.

16:49.018 --> 16:50.752
( Both laugh )

16:50.786 --> 16:51.953
Our cousins used to
always get together

16:51.988 --> 16:54.523
every summer for a few
weeks at my grandpa's.

16:54.557 --> 16:55.724
Stinson beach, right?

16:55.758 --> 16:58.894
One day, all the guys
decided that we would swim

16:58.928 --> 17:00.929
from the beach
to the dock and back.

17:00.963 --> 17:02.797
It's about a mile each way.

17:02.832 --> 17:05.700
And Maya insisted
on joining us.

17:05.734 --> 17:07.801
But after a few minutes,
she started fading fast.

17:07.837 --> 17:09.771
Wanted to prove she
could hang with the boys,

17:09.805 --> 17:12.574
so she decided if she
couldn't swim, she'd row.

17:12.608 --> 17:13.909
Got in her canoe and
rode all the way there.

17:13.943 --> 17:15.777
She beat us too.

17:15.810 --> 17:16.845
( Both laugh )

17:16.878 --> 17:18.914
It became a daily thing.

17:18.948 --> 17:23.685
Every morning, she'd row next
to us to the dock and back.

17:27.890 --> 17:29.624
I should get going.

17:29.659 --> 17:30.959
I gotta get to class.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.601
She talked about you
all the time.

17:39.635 --> 17:42.003
Said you were her
first real love.

17:47.743 --> 17:48.710
Hey, Nate.

17:48.744 --> 17:50.946
Do you have her
parents' address?

17:50.980 --> 17:52.847
I'd like to send them
a thank-you note.

17:52.882 --> 17:55.517
Don't have it with me.
Can I get it to you later?

17:55.551 --> 17:56.851
Yeah, sure.

17:56.886 --> 17:59.754
I'm glad I finally
got to meet you.

17:59.789 --> 18:02.524
Me too.

18:20.743 --> 18:24.579
He's still downstairs
talking to her.

18:24.614 --> 18:25.814
About what?

18:25.848 --> 18:27.582
He's been in there
for over an hour.

18:27.617 --> 18:29.718
Something to do with
Alison's missing remains.

18:29.752 --> 18:31.853
No, Mona doesn't know
anything about that.

18:31.887 --> 18:33.622
She's been in here
the last five months.

18:33.656 --> 18:34.889
Well, a judge doesn't
issue an oer like that

18:34.924 --> 18:36.625
unless there's
a pretty good reason.

18:38.828 --> 18:40.629
Look, can't you just
sneak me in there?

18:40.663 --> 18:42.597
I just have to see her.

18:42.632 --> 18:43.898
I have one question.
I'll be really quick.

18:43.933 --> 18:48.703
Oh, I know. I'd love to help.
But my hands are tied.

18:48.738 --> 18:51.706
I already got reprimanded
by her primary last week

18:51.741 --> 18:52.907
for extending
your visiting hours.

18:52.942 --> 18:54.542
I didn't know you did that.

18:54.577 --> 18:56.511
I didn't think you needed to.

18:56.545 --> 18:57.846
So why did you do it?

18:57.880 --> 19:01.583
Well, I saw you together
and thought you were connecting.

19:01.617 --> 19:02.884
Thank you.

19:04.820 --> 19:08.456
Hanna: He was there with
a court order to talk to her.

19:08.491 --> 19:10.825
So what do you think
Mona said to wilden?

19:10.860 --> 19:13.395
If she knows that we were at
Ali's grave that night...

19:13.429 --> 19:14.829
we would be in jail right now.

19:14.864 --> 19:16.531
( Sighs )

19:16.565 --> 19:18.433
You guys, we need to find out
who the black swan is.

19:18.467 --> 19:19.634
Like, now.

19:19.669 --> 19:21.636
I think we need to find out
when Melissa lost her baby.

19:21.671 --> 19:22.804
Yeah, she's right, Spence.

19:22.838 --> 19:24.572
Melissa lied for a reason.

19:24.607 --> 19:25.740
We need to find out what it is.

19:25.775 --> 19:27.809
Yeah, but we know
why Mona hated us.

19:27.843 --> 19:29.878
Why would my sister
wanna torture us?

19:29.912 --> 19:31.713
Because you made out
with her fiance

19:31.747 --> 19:32.881
and broke up their engagement.

19:32.915 --> 19:34.616
Okay, yeah, but that was me.

19:34.650 --> 19:35.884
And she knows that
we have the video

19:35.918 --> 19:38.586
that puts her in Ali's room
the night that she was murdered.

19:38.621 --> 19:40.689
And she fits the costume.

19:44.460 --> 19:47.829
Going to Philly.

19:47.863 --> 19:50.699
( Background chatter )

19:56.739 --> 20:01.443
It just never seems
to end for that family.

20:01.477 --> 20:02.844
Or our daughters.

20:02.878 --> 20:05.647
First Alison then Maya.

20:05.681 --> 20:07.816
I'm sorry.
Your takeout.

20:07.850 --> 20:09.617
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

20:09.652 --> 20:12.620
So are you meeting someone?
A date?

20:12.655 --> 20:15.423
( Laughs ) No.

20:15.458 --> 20:18.560
I haven't been on a date since
George clooney was <i>E.R.</i>

20:18.594 --> 20:20.595
I was hoping you might've met

20:20.629 --> 20:22.664
someone interesting
on mainlinemate.

20:22.698 --> 20:25.867
Mainlinemate?
What's that?

20:48.724 --> 20:50.892
( Cell phone rings )

20:52.628 --> 20:53.762
Hello?

20:53.796 --> 20:55.797
Hey. Melissa just left.
Should we go in?

20:55.831 --> 20:58.466
No, just wait. I'll text
you when she gets here.

20:58.501 --> 20:59.801
All right.
Roger that.

20:59.835 --> 21:01.703
"Roger that?"

21:01.737 --> 21:03.671
What? We're on a mission.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.808
Thank you.

21:06.842 --> 21:09.711
"Hotmama loves tango?"

21:09.745 --> 21:12.614
I'm going to kill Aria.

21:12.648 --> 21:13.782
How do I delete this?

21:13.816 --> 21:15.617
No, I wouldn't do that.

21:15.651 --> 21:18.787
I know there's some
strange people on here,

21:18.821 --> 21:21.422
but did you know
that Jane foster

21:21.457 --> 21:23.525
met her second and her third
husbands on this site?

21:23.559 --> 21:24.659
Perfect.

21:24.693 --> 21:26.661
( Laughs ) Seriously.

21:26.695 --> 21:28.730
I've met some good guys too.

21:28.764 --> 21:31.766
It's not easy to do at our age.

21:31.801 --> 21:32.834
The pool we're swimming in

21:32.868 --> 21:34.669
is much shallower
than it used to be.

21:34.703 --> 21:36.905
I don't know. It seems like
hatf of this town is divorced.

21:36.939 --> 21:42.510
Well, most of the men our age
want someone their age.

21:42.545 --> 21:44.512
Ella: Mm-hmm.

21:44.547 --> 21:47.549
Honestly...

21:47.583 --> 21:49.584
Dating isn't even on my mind.

21:49.618 --> 21:51.719
I'm just trying to adjust
to all the changes.

21:51.754 --> 21:54.455
I remember the feeling.

21:54.490 --> 21:57.458
Do you know I do not even
know how to barbecue?

21:57.493 --> 21:58.793
Or fix a toilet?

21:58.828 --> 22:01.529
Mine ran for three
hours last night

22:01.564 --> 22:04.465
until my neighbor came over
to ask if he could fix it

22:04.500 --> 22:06.501
because the noise
was keeping him awake.

22:06.535 --> 22:07.735
Well, some of the things
you figure out

22:07.770 --> 22:09.404
more quickly than others.

22:09.438 --> 22:10.705
And those that you don't,

22:10.739 --> 22:12.674
you figure out who to call
to figure it out for you.

22:12.708 --> 22:14.409
( Laughs )

22:14.443 --> 22:16.544
I think the hardest part for me

22:16.579 --> 22:20.481
was not having someone to
share the little stuff with.

22:20.516 --> 22:23.651
For me, it's sleeping at night.

22:23.686 --> 22:26.821
I still curl up
into my little area.

22:26.856 --> 22:28.556
And one morning you wake up

22:28.591 --> 22:31.359
and you'll realize you're
on the other side of the bed.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.695
And how long did
that take for you?

22:33.729 --> 22:37.365
Longer than I care to admit.

22:37.399 --> 22:38.766
( Phone chimes )

22:39.869 --> 22:41.502
Oh, look.

22:41.537 --> 22:43.805
It's a message from
mainlinemate.

22:43.839 --> 22:47.408
Frankie d. Wants
to meet me for coffee.

22:47.443 --> 22:48.476
Oh.

22:48.510 --> 22:49.644
He has a full head of hair,

22:49.678 --> 22:52.847
owns his own home,
and drives a red corvette.

22:52.882 --> 22:54.515
Wow.

22:54.550 --> 22:56.718
I'll share him with you.

22:56.752 --> 22:58.453
No, thanks.

22:58.487 --> 22:59.520
( Both laugh )

22:59.555 --> 23:00.788
You sure?
No, thank you.

23:00.823 --> 23:03.424
But wow.

23:03.459 --> 23:05.360
Yeah.

23:05.394 --> 23:06.794
All right, you guys,
it's been 20 minutes.

23:06.829 --> 23:08.363
We should just go in.

23:08.397 --> 23:09.530
Spencer hasn't texted yet.

23:09.565 --> 23:10.698
She will any minute.

23:10.733 --> 23:12.767
Hanna: Let's find out when
she lost that baby.

23:28.751 --> 23:30.852
( Keys jingling )

23:40.596 --> 23:42.730
What exactly
are we looking for?

23:42.765 --> 23:44.799
Medical records.
Anything with a date on it.

23:44.833 --> 23:46.668
I'm gonna go check the bedroom.

24:12.428 --> 24:13.795
Okay, there's
nothing in the bedroom.

24:13.829 --> 24:15.797
Is this anything?

24:15.831 --> 24:18.366
Yeah, her car insurance.

24:18.400 --> 24:21.369
( Phone vibrates )

24:21.403 --> 24:23.438
Melissa bought
a pair of Chloe boots

24:23.472 --> 24:24.806
from saks last
week for 900 bucks.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.408
Okay, now those I wanna see.

24:27.443 --> 24:30.745
I wanna find her
fake baby bump.

24:30.779 --> 24:33.581
What? Aren't you curious?
It has to be here somewhere.

24:33.615 --> 24:34.649
Gross.

24:37.820 --> 24:40.521
Oh, my God. She's even
more anal than Spencer.

24:40.556 --> 24:42.357
I didn't even think
that was possible.

24:44.660 --> 24:47.695
And, yet it is.

24:47.730 --> 24:49.664
Oh, my God.

24:49.698 --> 24:50.698
What?
It's Melissa!

24:50.733 --> 24:52.633
Where?
Outside.

24:52.668 --> 24:54.469
Put everything back.
What do we do?

24:54.503 --> 24:55.503
Put everything back
where you found it.

25:11.553 --> 25:13.287
Dammit!

25:13.322 --> 25:15.490
Hanna.

26:25.794 --> 26:28.429
( Exhales )

26:28.464 --> 26:29.597
That was close.
Yeah, way too close.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.532
Okay, let's just
get out of here.

26:31.567 --> 26:32.633
We need to hang these up.

26:32.668 --> 26:35.369
Wait, you guys.
Look.

26:47.716 --> 26:49.650
Wait.

26:58.895 --> 27:01.863
It matches the one Hanna found
at the masquerade ball.

27:04.107 --> 27:07.007
You know what they say,
if the feather fits.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.574
Hanna, it's the shoe.
If the shoe fits.

27:09.609 --> 27:10.509
Whatever. Melissa's "A".

27:10.543 --> 27:12.611
Guys, I know that
she looks suspicious.

27:12.645 --> 27:13.812
Okay, but we're
still just guessing.

27:13.846 --> 27:15.781
Well it's a guess
I'm willing to take.

27:15.815 --> 27:17.683
Me too.

27:18.918 --> 27:20.919
Fine, I'll go back to Philly.

27:20.953 --> 27:22.954
Mm-mmm.
You're not going alone.

27:22.989 --> 27:25.590
If Melissa is who
we think she is,

27:25.625 --> 27:27.526
then she's dangerous.

27:27.560 --> 27:31.630
Like, "probably had something to
do with Ali's murder" dangerous.

27:31.664 --> 27:33.699
She's not just trying
to hurt you, Spence.

27:33.733 --> 27:36.768
She's after all of us.

27:38.971 --> 27:43.508
Well, em gets off at 8:00,
so pick her up,

27:43.543 --> 27:44.910
and then we'll all go together.

27:55.555 --> 27:57.789
Want to help me
get dinner started?

27:59.559 --> 28:01.626
I thought you were staying
in Philly for the week.

28:01.661 --> 28:02.928
I decided to come back for mom.

28:02.962 --> 28:04.596
For mom?

28:04.630 --> 28:06.932
It was pretty humiliating what
Jason did to her at the grill.

28:06.966 --> 28:08.533
He lives next door to us.

28:08.568 --> 28:10.569
Who knows what this
person's gonna do next.

28:10.603 --> 28:12.604
He's our brother, Melissa.

28:12.638 --> 28:14.706
I was trying to be polite.

28:23.850 --> 28:26.752
I know that you were
dressed as the black swan

28:26.786 --> 28:28.687
at the masquerade ball.

28:28.721 --> 28:31.823
And I know that you didn't
lose the baby in June.

28:34.961 --> 28:37.662
Oh, God.
Please say something.

28:37.697 --> 28:39.498
Melissa.

28:39.532 --> 28:40.966
When did you lose the baby?

28:41.000 --> 28:44.503
( Sobs )

28:44.537 --> 28:45.837
The day after
I found Ian's body.

28:45.872 --> 28:49.541
What? How could
you not tell me?

28:49.575 --> 28:50.675
I tried to!

28:50.710 --> 28:51.777
When? When did you try?

28:51.811 --> 28:53.645
The night of Ian's funeral.

28:53.679 --> 28:54.946
But then I saw his
phone in your bag

28:54.981 --> 28:57.616
and I thought you were the
one sending me those texts.

28:57.650 --> 29:00.585
Why would you fake
being pregnant?

29:00.620 --> 29:03.655
I lost Ian!
I lost the baby.

29:03.689 --> 29:04.723
It was too much.

29:04.757 --> 29:06.892
So you pretended?

29:06.926 --> 29:08.894
My whole life was
in the papers.

29:08.928 --> 29:10.829
I couldn't deal with this
getting out there too.

29:14.634 --> 29:16.735
At least that's how it started.

29:16.769 --> 29:21.807
You had to know that
this couldn't last, right?

29:28.714 --> 29:31.817
Why were you at
the masquerade ball?

29:31.851 --> 29:35.554
I'd like to know the answer
to that myself.

29:37.824 --> 29:39.825
So, I decided to do it.

29:39.859 --> 29:41.726
My mom's out.

29:41.761 --> 29:43.795
I'm gonna tell Caleb tonight.

29:43.830 --> 29:47.799
I refuse to let this "A"
play divide and conquer.

29:47.834 --> 29:50.869
Oh. What time
is he coming over?

29:50.903 --> 29:52.537
( Phone chimes )

29:52.572 --> 29:53.638
Hey, that's probably him.
I'll call you back.

29:53.673 --> 29:54.739
Okay.

30:15.831 --> 30:18.832
One morning, there was a package in the
hallway outside my apartment.

30:19.666 --> 30:21.634
The black swan dress
was in it with a note

30:21.668 --> 30:22.868
telling me to wear
it to the ball,

30:22.903 --> 30:26.005
or everyone would find out
I was lying about the baby.

30:26.039 --> 30:28.674
Why didn't you tell anyone?

30:28.709 --> 30:32.578
Who? You? Mom? Dad?

30:32.612 --> 30:34.780
Garrett had just been arrested,

30:34.815 --> 30:38.584
I was scared and now someone
was blackmailing me.

30:38.618 --> 30:42.855
So I put on the dress
and I went to the ball.

30:42.889 --> 30:44.657
Why were you talking to Jenna?

30:44.691 --> 30:47.626
The note said to distract
Jenna at the ball.

30:47.661 --> 30:50.629
But then I saw your
friends and I... I ran out.

30:50.664 --> 30:53.666
Who would blackmail you?

30:53.700 --> 30:55.835
I'm assuming it was Mona.

30:55.869 --> 30:57.703
She was taken to
radley that night

30:57.738 --> 31:01.674
and I never got another
note or a threat again.

31:04.878 --> 31:06.746
Now that this is all
out in the open,

31:06.780 --> 31:10.583
I'm hoping we can
put this behind us.

31:10.617 --> 31:13.586
I'm going upstairs.
I need to lie down.

31:21.795 --> 31:24.997
( Door closes )

31:25.031 --> 31:26.899
Who else knows that
she was faking it?

31:29.703 --> 31:30.770
Your father.

31:34.941 --> 31:36.642
And Garrett.

31:36.676 --> 31:39.979
Wait, so that's
why you took the case?

31:40.013 --> 31:41.747
'Cause Garrett's
blackmailing you?

31:41.782 --> 31:43.616
It's not that.
Then why?

31:43.650 --> 31:46.018
Mom, you better
tell me right now,

31:46.052 --> 31:47.953
or I swear to God, I'm gonna
walk out of that door

31:47.988 --> 31:49.054
and I'm not gonna come back.

31:51.892 --> 31:55.728
Garrett told me that
his public defender

31:55.762 --> 31:58.798
was putting together
a list of defense witnesses.

31:58.832 --> 32:00.733
I recognized one of the names.

32:00.767 --> 32:05.805
The p.I. That your
father and I had hired to...

32:05.839 --> 32:08.941
Watch Melissa after
Alison went missing.

32:08.975 --> 32:11.710
And he found something
about Melissa.

32:11.745 --> 32:13.546
Your sister had nothing
to do with the murder.

32:13.580 --> 32:16.882
But if a jury found out
that we'd hired someone

32:16.917 --> 32:20.786
and learned that she was
faking her pregnancy,

32:20.821 --> 32:23.789
then they'd instantly think that
she was guilty of something.

32:23.824 --> 32:26.725
Melissa: Mom?

32:29.763 --> 32:32.665
Spencer, you can't tell anyone.

32:37.904 --> 32:41.674
Like it or not,
this is your family.

32:56.890 --> 32:58.924
Hey.

32:58.959 --> 33:01.560
Hi.

33:01.595 --> 33:02.728
You okay?

33:02.762 --> 33:04.930
Not really.

33:04.965 --> 33:06.832
My mom was in a car accident.

33:06.867 --> 33:09.602
Oh, my God.

33:09.636 --> 33:11.737
Wait, when did this happen?
Is she okay?

33:11.771 --> 33:14.540
Yeah, she's lucky.

33:14.574 --> 33:15.641
Could've been a lot worse.

33:15.675 --> 33:17.509
She was in Montecito.

33:17.544 --> 33:18.611
Yeah.

33:18.645 --> 33:19.745
It's pretty screwed up though.

33:19.779 --> 33:20.846
She said that she
felt like someone

33:20.881 --> 33:22.648
was trying to run
her off the road.

33:24.651 --> 33:26.986
I can't believe
somebody would do that.

33:27.020 --> 33:30.522
Yeah, me neither.

33:30.557 --> 33:32.925
Anyway, you said you had
something to tell me?

33:32.959 --> 33:35.728
Yeah, um...

33:35.762 --> 33:38.731
Yeah, I thought I'd be
able to talk about it, but.

33:38.765 --> 33:39.932
But what?

33:39.966 --> 33:42.601
Right now is not
really a good time.

33:42.636 --> 33:45.738
I don't understand.

33:47.874 --> 33:51.543
First, you tell me that you're
hiding something from me.

33:51.578 --> 33:53.879
And now you're saying that
you can't tell me what that is.

33:53.914 --> 33:56.849
Caleb, it's nothing.
Really.

33:56.883 --> 33:58.951
Hanna...

33:58.985 --> 34:03.656
I understand that when
you lied to me last year,

34:03.690 --> 34:04.790
you were trying to protect me.

34:04.824 --> 34:08.594
But there's no more "A".

34:10.630 --> 34:13.998
So why are you lying to me now?

34:16.569 --> 34:17.902
Is this about Mona?

34:17.938 --> 34:19.638
No.

34:19.672 --> 34:20.672
Then what?

34:20.706 --> 34:22.641
Could we just drop it?

34:27.813 --> 34:29.648
Caleb, where are you going?

34:30.917 --> 34:34.553
I can't do this anymore.

34:34.587 --> 34:35.853
Can't do what?

34:35.889 --> 34:37.623
This.

34:39.626 --> 34:43.661
I feel like you've been
pushing me away for weeks.

34:43.697 --> 34:45.531
And I just...
I keep hoping that things

34:45.565 --> 34:47.733
are going to go back
to the way that they were.

34:47.766 --> 34:49.868
But, clearly,
that's not going to happen.

34:49.902 --> 34:51.870
You just gotta be
patient with me right now.

34:51.905 --> 34:54.739
Hanna, I have been nothing
but patient with you.

34:57.777 --> 35:02.815
I feel like I only exist
in half of your life.

35:02.849 --> 35:04.850
And that's not
good enough for me.

35:08.822 --> 35:12.591
You have to give
me something here.

35:16.830 --> 35:18.731
More silence.

35:21.701 --> 35:24.737
Great.

35:29.642 --> 35:32.711
I'm done, Hanna.

35:36.649 --> 35:38.884
What do you mean, you're done?

35:38.918 --> 35:41.820
Are you...

35:41.855 --> 35:44.823
are you breaking up with me?

35:50.697 --> 35:54.700
You're hardly giving me much
of a choice, are you?

35:57.737 --> 35:59.805
( Exhales )

36:09.056 --> 36:12.091
( Knocking ) Come in.

36:12.126 --> 36:14.727
Hey.

36:14.762 --> 36:15.862
What're you doing here?

36:15.896 --> 36:16.896
I thought we were doing
dinner tomorrow night.

36:16.931 --> 36:18.731
We are.
I just stopped by

36:18.766 --> 36:20.066
to get some things
for the apartment

36:20.100 --> 36:21.868
and I saw your light on.

36:21.902 --> 36:22.835
Can we talk?

36:22.870 --> 36:23.770
Sure.

36:23.804 --> 36:26.839
I saw my online dating profile.

36:26.874 --> 36:28.708
Oh.

36:28.742 --> 36:30.076
Look, mom,

36:30.110 --> 36:31.945
I... I can explain that.

36:31.979 --> 36:34.814
You know, part of me is angry

36:34.848 --> 36:36.983
that you inserted yourself
into my personal life,

36:37.017 --> 36:38.918
and the other part
of me realizes

36:38.953 --> 36:41.054
that you were just
trying to help.

36:41.088 --> 36:43.690
I'm sorry. Really.

36:43.724 --> 36:44.891
I know that I shouldn't
have done it.

36:44.925 --> 36:47.927
I just... I thought it would
be nice if you met someone.

36:47.962 --> 36:49.929
Especially since dad's...

36:49.964 --> 36:51.864
seeing Meredith again?

36:51.899 --> 36:53.132
You know about that?

36:53.167 --> 36:54.968
I do.

36:55.002 --> 36:57.170
And I'm okay with it.

36:57.204 --> 36:58.771
You are?

36:58.806 --> 37:00.873
Yeah. We're not
together anymore.

37:00.908 --> 37:02.942
He can date whoever
he wants to date.

37:02.977 --> 37:05.044
I meani wish it
was somebody else,

37:05.079 --> 37:07.013
but, what am I gonna do?

37:07.047 --> 37:09.916
I was worried about you.

37:09.950 --> 37:11.651
I want you to be happy.

37:11.685 --> 37:14.020
It's been a couple of
overwhelming months for me

37:14.054 --> 37:15.955
and I'm doing my best
to get through it,

37:15.990 --> 37:18.791
but that doesn't mean
that I'm lonely,

37:18.826 --> 37:20.760
or dying for companionship.

37:20.794 --> 37:21.894
You're not?

37:21.929 --> 37:23.663
No. I've been a wife

37:23.697 --> 37:25.898
and a mom my entire adult life

37:25.933 --> 37:29.002
and I'm looking forward to
getting to a common place

37:29.036 --> 37:31.971
and having some time for myself

37:32.006 --> 37:34.874
before I add somebody
else to that equation.

37:34.908 --> 37:36.876
You can understand that, right?

37:36.910 --> 37:38.878
Yes.

37:38.912 --> 37:41.914
And, by the way,
"hotmama", really?

37:41.949 --> 37:42.949
Seriously?

37:42.983 --> 37:44.684
I'm gonna go delete
that right now.

37:44.718 --> 37:46.085
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.021
Maybe we should leave it up

37:48.055 --> 37:49.822
for a little while.

37:52.159 --> 37:55.094
( Both chuckle )

37:55.129 --> 37:57.997
♪

38:00.067 --> 38:01.768
Oh, thanks.

38:01.802 --> 38:02.969
No problem.

38:03.003 --> 38:07.907
I just realized I forgot Maya's
parents address in my car.

38:09.743 --> 38:11.678
Felt good writing it.

38:11.712 --> 38:13.813
It's kind of like the
goodbye I never had.

38:13.847 --> 38:16.716
I'm actually mailing a package
to them in the morning.

38:16.750 --> 38:17.917
Want me to just
add it in there?

38:17.951 --> 38:20.953
Sure. Thanks.
I have to get going.

38:20.988 --> 38:22.021
I'm meeting some friends,

38:22.056 --> 38:24.757
but we should grab
a bite sometime.

38:24.792 --> 38:26.793
Yeah, sure.
If I'm still around.

38:26.827 --> 38:27.927
Where are you going?

38:27.961 --> 38:29.796
Thinking about heading home.

38:29.830 --> 38:30.997
Maybe transferring
somewhere else.

38:31.031 --> 38:32.699
You don't like Hollis?

38:32.733 --> 38:34.901
It's not that,
I just...

38:34.935 --> 38:37.036
I'm having a tough
time settling in.

38:37.071 --> 38:40.973
All anyone seems to talk about
around here is Maya's death.

38:41.008 --> 38:43.042
Big news in a small town.

38:43.077 --> 38:46.112
I get it, but when
I think about Maya,

38:46.146 --> 38:48.948
I wanna think about how she
lived, not how she died.

38:48.982 --> 38:50.850
Yeah.

38:50.884 --> 38:52.719
Losing Maya was
the hardest thing

38:52.753 --> 38:53.953
I've ever had to deal with.

38:53.987 --> 38:56.723
It's turned my
whole world around.

38:56.757 --> 38:58.958
I'm sure it's only
going to get harder

38:58.992 --> 39:00.927
when the trial starts.

39:02.863 --> 39:05.765
But I also know that Maya

39:05.799 --> 39:08.768
wouldn't want you to leave
school because of her.

39:08.802 --> 39:10.670
She'd want you to find a way

39:10.704 --> 39:12.772
to block out the
difficult stuff

39:12.806 --> 39:14.774
so you can embrace the good.

39:17.778 --> 39:19.712
Maybe you should
take your own advice.

39:19.747 --> 39:20.847
What do you mean?

39:20.881 --> 39:23.649
You're gonna have to let her
go at some point, right?

39:23.684 --> 39:27.954
I mean, deep down you would
know she'd want you to.

39:33.994 --> 39:38.731
If you do end up staying,

39:38.766 --> 39:40.800
know that you have a friend.

39:44.838 --> 39:47.707
Maya was a lucky girl.

40:02.156 --> 40:05.158
( Sobbing )

40:40.894 --> 40:43.095
Out for an evening stroll?

40:43.130 --> 40:46.732
I'm just trying
to clear my head.

40:46.767 --> 40:47.800
Rough night?

40:47.835 --> 40:52.705
Rough two years.

40:52.739 --> 40:54.941
I've received over 200
calls in the last few days

40:54.975 --> 40:58.044
all swearing they know
who stole Ali's remains.

40:58.078 --> 41:02.849
Everyone's being accused from
Mrs. Welch to Obama to you.

41:02.883 --> 41:06.786
But it's all just lies.

41:09.790 --> 41:12.992
You have no idea how
much I'm looking forward

41:13.026 --> 41:14.961
to going to college next year.

41:14.995 --> 41:17.029
Getting out of this place.

41:17.064 --> 41:19.932
All these dysfunctional people.

41:19.967 --> 41:22.902
Yeah, sounds good, doesn't it?

41:22.936 --> 41:25.071
Well, unfortunately,
it doesn't work that way.

41:25.105 --> 41:26.973
Trust me.

41:27.007 --> 41:28.641
You can leave Rosewood,

41:28.675 --> 41:30.810
but Rosewood will
never leave you.

41:30.844 --> 41:33.045
( Cell phone chimes )

41:35.048 --> 41:37.783
I've got to, uh...
I gotta do a few things.

41:37.818 --> 41:39.785
Driving up to meet my
parents in the morning.

41:39.820 --> 41:44.657
Tell them I say hi.

41:44.691 --> 41:47.894
Spencer, I'm withdrawing
the reward.

41:47.928 --> 41:49.996
You were right.

41:50.030 --> 41:51.130
It's too much for me.

41:53.066 --> 41:56.135
Truth always comes out, Jason.

41:56.169 --> 41:58.971
One way or another.

42:31.805 --> 42:34.674
Yeah, meet me in the
parking lot in 15 minutes.

42:52.759 --> 42:54.961
Is there a problem, detective?

42:54.995 --> 42:57.730
How far away is your
parents' lake house?

42:57.764 --> 42:59.031
Why?

42:59.066 --> 43:01.000
Just curious.

43:10.877 --> 43:12.979
