00:34.802 --> 00:36.102
Oh, Stan...

00:36.104 --> 00:38.638
I love having date night on a Tuesday.

00:38.640 --> 00:42.141
And it's Taco Tuesday, where
all the tacos are two for one.

00:43.178 --> 00:45.611
Your frugality is so sexy.

00:45.613 --> 00:48.715
I brought a garbage bag that
we can fill with chips.

00:48.717 --> 00:51.317
You know, maybe with
all the money we're saving

00:51.319 --> 00:54.654
on Mexican food, we can
finally buy a new couch.

00:54.656 --> 00:57.223
Too many animals have
given birth on the old one.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.958
Stan...?

00:58.960 --> 01:00.259
Are you listening?

01:02.129 --> 01:03.329
Yeah...

01:03.331 --> 01:05.531
I was, I was just looking at...

01:05.533 --> 01:07.033
the-the alcohol.

01:07.035 --> 01:09.402
H-H-Have they always
served hard alcohol here?

01:09.404 --> 01:12.572
Stan, you have two Jack
and Cokes in front of you.

01:12.574 --> 01:15.308
You get them every time we come here.

01:15.310 --> 01:16.709
Jack is alcohol?!

01:16.711 --> 01:18.511
Why, I always thought it was slang.

01:18.513 --> 01:21.781
Like, "That soda be so cheap
you Jack and Coke, son."

01:27.688 --> 01:29.522
You just couldn't keep your eyes off

01:29.524 --> 01:31.224
that slutty bartender, could you?

01:31.226 --> 01:32.558
Wait, what?!

01:32.560 --> 01:33.993
Are you just guessing that she's slutty,

01:33.995 --> 01:36.555
or have you heard something?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.333
Well, we're in the driveway

01:40.335 --> 01:42.168
and that's where all conversations end.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.871
I'm gonna go deal with
the B-side of Taco Tuesday.

01:44.873 --> 01:46.172
See you at sex later?

01:50.077 --> 01:53.413
Wednesday morning, that means
Stan's fresh off date night.

01:53.415 --> 01:54.680
Come on, spill it!

01:54.682 --> 01:55.882
All right. Highlight:

01:55.884 --> 01:58.284

01:58.286 --> 01:59.519
Nice!
The master!

01:59.521 --> 02:01.254
Keeping it cheap!

02:01.256 --> 02:03.389
Francine almost busted me

02:03.391 --> 02:05.091
checking out this hot girl's boobs.

02:05.093 --> 02:07.093
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
You can't get caught looking.

02:07.095 --> 02:08.794
Yeah, man.
Women talk.

02:08.797 --> 02:11.097
If my girlfriend hears
you're checking out other women,

02:11.099 --> 02:13.032
she'll realize I do it too.

02:13.034 --> 02:14.400
Guys, guys, relax.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.968
I covered it with an excuse

02:15.970 --> 02:17.804
and even agreed to go
couch shopping at the mall.

02:17.806 --> 02:19.105
The mall?!

02:19.107 --> 02:20.940
That place is crawling with hot chicks.

02:20.942 --> 02:23.743
So, I'll just play it safe
and not look at <i>any</i> women.

02:23.745 --> 02:25.278
No, you can still look.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.213
You just gotta learn to rubberneck.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.748
"Rubberneck?"
What's that?

02:28.750 --> 02:31.651
We'll tell you, but you
gotta keep it a secret.

02:31.653 --> 02:34.654
Women can never find out
about rubbernecking.

02:34.656 --> 02:37.023
New black intern:
Kick it.

02:41.129 --> 02:44.730
Rubbernecking is the art of
checking out women on the sly.

02:44.732 --> 02:48.234

you'll <i>never</i> get caught.

Okay, what now?

04:27.701 --> 04:29.402
A new couch!

04:29.404 --> 04:31.404
It feels like I'm floating.

04:31.406 --> 04:34.507
Well, I took a long enough
lunch; better go back to work.

04:34.509 --> 04:35.908
Listen, Stan...

04:35.910 --> 04:38.611
I'm sorry I got so paranoid last night.

04:38.613 --> 04:41.347
There were beautiful women
all over the mall today

04:41.349 --> 04:42.715
and you didn't even notice.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.383
You're talking about that redhead, right?

04:44.385 --> 04:47.987

04:50.891 --> 04:52.592
You know, Klaus,

04:52.594 --> 04:54.894
I've been saving something
for an occasion just like this.

04:54.896 --> 04:58.097
This bottle of wine was
a gift from Julia Child...

04:58.099 --> 04:59.532
to Liz Taylor.

04:59.534 --> 05:02.094
I stole it when I worked
at the post office.

05:02.803 --> 05:06.305
Yes, red wine, the deepest
staining of all the wines.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.873
To our new couch.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.978
That was a terrible toast.

05:11.980 --> 05:13.212
Could've been about any couch.

05:13.214 --> 05:14.380
Let's try again.

05:14.382 --> 05:17.049
To our new, pristine, white couch.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.155
Blech! Ooh! It's turned.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.790
That is bad wine.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.325
That is <i>real</i> bad wine.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.994
Never keep wine in the car.

05:27.996 --> 05:29.929
I knew it and I did it anyway.

05:29.931 --> 05:31.464
Oh, no, the couch.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.767
The cushions are sewn in.

05:34.769 --> 05:35.768
We can't flip them.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.737
Stan will kill us!

05:37.739 --> 05:39.605
What are we gonna do?!

05:39.607 --> 05:41.574
We'll just have to sit here forever.

05:41.576 --> 05:43.509
That's brilliant!

05:43.511 --> 05:47.346

we were a moment ago?

You see, I was driving responsibly

07:12.435 --> 07:15.603
with my eyes on the road,
when a dog jumped out.

07:15.605 --> 07:17.571
I saved his life by swerving.

07:17.573 --> 07:19.407
He made eye contact as he ran away.

07:19.409 --> 07:22.043
No words exchanged,
he wasn't a talking dog,

07:22.045 --> 07:25.279

I knew he thought me a hero.

07:25.281 --> 07:28.049
Well, come on.
With a head trauma like this,

07:28.051 --> 07:29.717

07:29.719 --> 07:34.055

fever, sleep a concussion."

07:57.914 --> 07:59.080

and I'm here to review

08:04.320 --> 08:06.487
Anyway, I was hoping to talk to you

08:06.489 --> 08:09.190
about exactly how your accident went down.

08:09.192 --> 08:10.591
Of course!
Of cour... of course.

08:10.593 --> 08:11.659
Come in. Come in.

08:11.661 --> 08:14.462
Hope you like nothin', 'cause
that's what I got to hide.

08:23.506 --> 08:25.206
I'm Jean-Louise Finch.

08:25.208 --> 08:28.609
You brought us some molasses
one foggy morning, remember?

08:30.145 --> 08:33.280
So... yeah, let's-let's
go to the kitchen.

08:35.818 --> 08:38.119
Thank you once more for this delicious...

08:38.121 --> 08:39.854
glass of milk.

08:39.856 --> 08:42.690
Now, Mr. Smith, before I start,
I want to remind you

08:42.692 --> 08:44.959
that insurance fraud is a felony,

08:44.961 --> 08:47.061
punishable by serious jail time.

08:48.331 --> 08:50.364
Your sworn statement says you swerved

08:50.366 --> 08:52.533
because a dog jumped in front of your car?

08:52.535 --> 08:54.468
Are you sure that's
what caused the accident?

08:54.470 --> 08:56.137
Why wouldn't he be sure?

08:56.139 --> 08:57.638
I don't know, Mrs. Smith.

08:57.640 --> 09:00.474
It's not my job to know
what caused the accident.

09:00.476 --> 09:02.543
It's my job to find out.

09:02.545 --> 09:05.079
And then, after that... to know.

09:09.751 --> 09:13.587
He keeps drinking, but there's
always the same amount of milk!

09:17.592 --> 09:19.927
Thank you again,
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

09:19.929 --> 09:23.197
I will return this glass
when I am done with my milk.

09:23.199 --> 09:26.167
Oh, don't return it, just put
it down when you're done.

09:26.169 --> 09:27.935
If I was meant to have it,
it'll find its way back to me.

09:27.937 --> 09:32.339
And Mr. Smith, please know that
if you are hiding <i>anything,</i>

09:32.341 --> 09:35.276
anything at all, I will sniff it out.

09:35.278 --> 09:37.278
It's an ability of mine.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.547

if the sidecar comes unattached,
it's a separate vehicle

11:07.203 --> 11:09.136
and it's not covered.

11:09.138 --> 11:10.437
Heinrich!

11:10.439 --> 11:12.039
Wh-What, wh-what
are you doing here?

11:12.041 --> 11:13.874
Mr. Smith.

11:13.876 --> 11:15.509
I was about to close your case,

11:15.511 --> 11:19.947
but one small, easily-answered
question arose.

11:19.949 --> 11:21.348
It-it... it did?

11:21.350 --> 11:24.318
Yes, you said a dog ran in front
of your car.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.187
But in this traffic camera photo,

11:26.189 --> 11:29.557
the only thing <i>I</i> see is a fox.

11:31.227 --> 11:33.194
She's quite beautiful.

11:33.196 --> 11:35.396
Did she happen to catch your eye?

11:35.398 --> 11:37.064
Oh, I don't... I don't pay
attention to joggers

11:37.066 --> 11:39.867
when I'm driving. No, th-they're
like pedestrians to me.

11:39.869 --> 11:41.635
I'm just gonna come out and say it:

11:41.637 --> 11:43.070
I think you were rubbernecking.

11:43.072 --> 11:44.405
With the best.

11:44.407 --> 11:46.674
But I unfortunately have no evidence.

11:46.676 --> 11:49.710
So I'm gonna have to close your case.

11:51.414 --> 11:53.981
As long as I don't find anything
at the routine inspection

11:53.983 --> 11:56.650
of your vehicle at the body shop.

12:00.555 --> 12:02.556
Well, looks like we're in the clear.

12:02.558 --> 12:04.658
He's not gonna find anything.
The only evidence

12:04.660 --> 12:06.527
is some pictures of that jogger
in my phone.

12:06.529 --> 12:08.529
Which I haven't even looked at
since the accident

12:08.531 --> 12:10.698
because my phone's in my car.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.567
You brought him in here, you bastard!

12:13.569 --> 12:17.338
Rubbernecking is all I have!

12:19.742 --> 12:23.177
Get down there and clean up your mess!

12:25.614 --> 12:28.849
'Twas beauty killed the beast.

12:30.118 --> 12:33.587
Mr. Smith, how odd
to see you here.

12:33.589 --> 12:35.623
Have you inspected the car?

12:35.625 --> 12:37.625
Everywhere but under the driver's seat.

12:37.627 --> 12:40.794
I always save that...
for dessert.

12:50.305 --> 12:52.706
Nothing.

12:52.708 --> 12:54.808
Mr. Smith,
I'm a proud man

12:54.810 --> 12:57.878
but not too proud to admit when I'm beaten.

12:57.880 --> 13:00.414
I'm very proud of that.

13:00.416 --> 13:02.716
Good-bye forever,
Mr. Smith.

13:10.292 --> 13:11.853
My glass!

13:12.627 --> 13:15.562
Aw...

13:15.564 --> 13:18.165
Stan? I lied, Stan.

13:18.167 --> 13:21.168
Klaus didn't spill
the wine... we both did.

13:21.170 --> 13:23.437
I had to tell you 'cause it's the truth.

13:23.439 --> 13:27.308
And if we ain't got no truth
in this world, what do we have?

13:27.310 --> 13:28.942
Damn lies.

13:28.944 --> 13:31.178
You're not Stan.
How'd you get Stan's phone?

13:31.180 --> 13:32.746
What else of Stan's do you have?

13:32.748 --> 13:34.348
Let's sell it all and split the dough.

13:34.350 --> 13:37.351
We're in this together.
Don't you dare double-cross me!

13:39.120 --> 13:43.023
Just as I suspected.

13:43.025 --> 13:45.359
Your crash was caused by rubbernecking.

13:45.361 --> 13:49.330
Mr. Smith, you're under arrest
for insurance fraud.

13:52.535 --> 13:54.201
Oh, my God, what happened?

13:54.203 --> 13:58.272
I was checking out a hot
chick in a news copter.

13:58.274 --> 14:01.108
See? He told the truth.

14:01.110 --> 14:03.010
And everyone's the better for it.

14:03.012 --> 14:05.012
I'd like to purchase...

14:05.014 --> 14:07.348
some life insurance.

14:07.350 --> 14:08.982
Are you a smoker?

14:08.984 --> 14:10.984
Only when I drink.

14:18.128 --> 14:19.862
Steve, why isn't your mother here?

14:19.864 --> 14:21.196
She's hurt, Dad.

14:21.198 --> 14:23.065
She's so upset about your rubbernecking

14:23.067 --> 14:25.234
she's not even coming to your trial.

14:25.236 --> 14:28.237
And I got to say, I don't blame her.

14:35.445 --> 14:37.746

Seriously, this isn't a great
place not to be wearing a shirt.

16:09.807 --> 16:12.474
Let him sing!

16:20.650 --> 16:22.251
All right.

16:22.253 --> 16:25.854
Mr. Smith, you will be judged
by a jury of your peers,

16:25.856 --> 16:27.756
who just happen to all be

16:27.758 --> 16:29.758
married women around your wife's age.

16:31.562 --> 16:35.264
Mr. Smith, this is a photo not
of the dog you claimed to avoid

16:35.266 --> 16:37.266
but of an admittedly attractive jogger

16:37.268 --> 16:39.701
that you took at the time of your accident.

16:39.703 --> 16:42.604
And here is a photo of your wife.

16:42.606 --> 16:44.006
With a wife this attractive,

16:44.008 --> 16:46.074
why were you looking at another woman?

16:46.076 --> 16:48.610
Are you some kind of deviant?

16:48.612 --> 16:50.012
What? No.

16:50.014 --> 16:52.814
Looking at other women
is normal. It's...

16:53.616 --> 16:54.750
Mr. Smith?

16:54.752 --> 16:55.951
You were saying?

16:55.953 --> 16:57.719
No, I-I-I don't,
I don't think I was.

16:57.721 --> 17:00.589
Come on, Mr. Smith.
Admit it.

17:00.591 --> 17:05.294
You're a sex-crazed maniac,
no better than a U.S. senator.

17:05.296 --> 17:06.694
How dare you!

17:06.696 --> 17:08.931
I am a lot of things, but not a senator!

17:08.933 --> 17:11.767
Then why were you taking these photos?!

17:11.769 --> 17:13.635
Because I was rubbernecking!

17:13.637 --> 17:14.803
All men do it!

17:16.973 --> 17:18.874
I don't.

17:18.876 --> 17:20.275
You're a dead man, Smith!

17:20.277 --> 17:21.944
You are gonna die!

17:21.945 --> 17:23.412
I don't know where or when,

17:23.414 --> 17:26.281
but each of us has to go in our own time!

17:26.282 --> 17:28.383
Is that even a threat?

17:28.385 --> 17:29.751
Order! Order!

17:29.753 --> 17:31.053
The gallery will refrain

17:31.055 --> 17:33.221
from shouting out existential truisms!

17:33.223 --> 17:34.790
Listen, I know I'm a judge

17:34.792 --> 17:37.759
and I'm supposed to make sure
you get a fair trial,

17:37.761 --> 17:40.796
but everyone in here
should be disgusted with you.

17:40.798 --> 17:44.099
If my wife looked like yours,
I'd never take my eyes off her.

17:44.101 --> 17:45.934
Oh, you wouldn't, would you?

17:45.936 --> 17:50.072
Wait, Your Honor, can I ask
the court for a quick recess?

17:51.074 --> 17:52.808
Didn't really wait for my answer...

17:52.810 --> 17:54.509
Steve, take this to your mother.

17:54.511 --> 17:56.111
She doesn't want to hear it, Dad.

17:56.113 --> 17:58.246
She won't have to hear it.
She'll have to read it.

17:58.248 --> 18:00.949
Just make sure she does.

18:00.951 --> 18:01.950
Whatever.

18:01.952 --> 18:03.151
20 minute recess.

18:03.153 --> 18:04.853
Dick.

18:11.494 --> 18:13.462
Oh...

18:15.765 --> 18:17.165
Well, I forgot where we were,

18:17.167 --> 18:19.034
so I guess, Mr. Smith,
you have the floor.

18:19.036 --> 18:20.335
You're a bad judge.

18:20.337 --> 18:23.171
Well, I'm not the one on trial, am I?

18:23.173 --> 18:24.439
Am I?

18:25.475 --> 18:26.541
Proceed.

18:30.213 --> 18:32.614
Your Honor, I'd like
to call to the stand...

18:32.616 --> 18:34.449
Francine Smith.

18:55.972 --> 18:57.239
Busted!

18:57.241 --> 18:59.541
Rubbernecking! Rubbernecking!

18:59.543 --> 19:01.743
Rubberne...

19:02.979 --> 19:03.979
Rubbernecking!

19:03.981 --> 19:05.414
You were all rubbernecking!

19:05.416 --> 19:07.816
See? I told you! All men do it.

19:07.818 --> 19:09.684
But that doesn't make us bad guys.

19:09.686 --> 19:11.753
It's like I said in my note, Francine.

19:11.755 --> 19:13.688
I may look at other women, but...

19:13.690 --> 19:15.757
it doesn't mean I love you any less.

19:15.759 --> 19:19.995
My eyes may wander, but my
heart always comes home.

19:19.997 --> 19:21.663
Oh, Stan.

19:21.665 --> 19:26.101
Well, to be completely honest,
when I walked in here,

you're on trial for insurance fraud,

which you definitely did.

I hereby sentence you
