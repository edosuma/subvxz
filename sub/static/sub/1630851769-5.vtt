WEBVTT

00:13.430 --> 00:15.140
- Deep in the woods,
there lies a secret Door.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.225
It is my duty
to guard this Door

00:17.267 --> 00:19.769
from the horrors
that lie behind it.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.604
- Calm mind, steady hand.

00:22.564 --> 00:23.898
- What are you doing?
Fight me.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.859
- I'm not gonna hurt her
while she just stands there.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.110
- Hah!
- Oh--

00:27.152 --> 00:28.945
- I have to go back
to get the Ledger.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.155
- What's the Ledger?

00:30.196 --> 00:31.406
- It'll tell us how
to close the tear.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.658
- You wanna act pretty
like your mom, faggot?

00:37.245 --> 00:38.496
- Nolan, I'm sorry.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.749
- It's over, Carrie.
You lost.

00:40.790 --> 00:41.750
- Spoons?

00:42.917 --> 00:44.377
Aah!

00:45.962 --> 00:49.215
various voices: Warmth...
warmth...

00:49.257 --> 00:51.176
- Warmth.
- Warmth.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.261
Warmth.
- Warmth.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.180
- Warmth.
- Warmth.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.015
- Warmth.
- Warmth.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.060
- Warmth.
- Warmth.

01:10.653 --> 01:11.946
- Warmth.

01:11.988 --> 01:14.074
- Warmth.
- Warmth.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.749
- In the tradition
of the Guardians

01:22.791 --> 01:24.250
who came before her...

01:27.128 --> 01:30.423
The council gathers to invite

01:30.465 --> 01:33.551
Carrie Lavinia Ecker...

01:35.887 --> 01:38.640
Child of the dawn,

01:38.682 --> 01:41.559
to bear forth
the responsibility

01:41.601 --> 01:43.853
of entering into vast
Gehenna...

01:47.315 --> 01:50.902
And serving
in the honored position

01:50.944 --> 01:53.405
of guarding its sacred Door.

02:01.454 --> 02:05.291
May the body
of all Disciples be one.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.091
- Warmth.
- Warmth.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.249
- I'll do my best
to protect you.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.209
There's a panic button
in the outpost.

02:48.251 --> 02:51.504
You press it,
and this calls me.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.840
Use it only in emergencies.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.886
Each time I open that door
means risk of escape.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.596
They can't see.

02:59.637 --> 03:02.432
And if they whiff even the
faintest trace of our world,

03:02.474 --> 03:05.393
they'll come running.
Don't test me on that.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.233
Take pride in your sacrifice.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.278
You've earned this.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.467
To Vast Gehenna
I give my skin,

03:37.509 --> 03:41.262
pray warm shadow
let me in.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.992
Solitude is a kiss.

05:23.531 --> 05:26.951
- This hurts me more than
it hurts you, Carrie.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.829
- What are you gonna do
with me?

05:29.871 --> 05:32.123
- The elders wanna chat
with you.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.084
I'm just escorting you home.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.961
- Hah--
- Aah!

05:38.421 --> 05:39.589
- Aah--

05:39.631 --> 05:42.092
Carrie--warmth!

05:42.133 --> 05:44.511
What did you expect from that?

05:44.552 --> 05:46.304
- Help! Help!

05:51.976 --> 05:55.188
- I don't expect you
to talk right now.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.899
But I'm here when you need to.

05:57.941 --> 06:02.278
'Bout Spoons, 'bout anything,
I don't know, whatever.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.198
Flaming Hot Cheetos or the
resurgence of the bucket hat--

06:05.240 --> 06:06.658
I'm there. Okay?

06:08.952 --> 06:11.413
Do you hear that?

06:13.248 --> 06:16.084
- I'm sorry. I can't hear--
- Shh. Listen.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.213
- Baby, I don't--

06:30.390 --> 06:32.934
- Don't go in today.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.646
- Hey, you're safe, okay?

06:36.688 --> 06:39.482
- Dad, don't go
in the tunnels today.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.693
Promise me.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.294
- Nolan, you have
to answer your phone.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.962
Honey, we've been worried sick.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.256
Hey.
Hey, come back where were you?

07:03.298 --> 07:05.884
- I was at a good old
West Pine hootenanny.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.053
- Are you okay?
Who did this to you?

07:11.723 --> 07:14.976
Well, you're up, babe.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.608
Ohh...

07:23.151 --> 07:25.987
That's kinda punk rock.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.908
- Yeah, so very punk, Dad.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.703
- 2010 Riesling.

07:33.745 --> 07:38.124
Buddy, there's cheaper wine.
Never mind.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.588
You've had it tough.

07:43.630 --> 07:49.302
- What are we supposed to do?
This town is...suffocating.

07:49.344 --> 07:52.931
- Yeah, maybe you fight back
a little, huh?

07:52.972 --> 07:55.100
West Piners will lock
onto your difference,

07:55.141 --> 07:57.310
so maybe put on some camo
till collage.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.938
It's not that far off.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.899
All right.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.901
Look...

08:12.867 --> 08:15.412
We don't wanna force
you to talk about it.

08:15.453 --> 08:18.832
But if you're gay,
if you like men,

08:18.873 --> 08:20.834
that is a beautiful thing.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.294
- Yeah, I'm serious.

08:23.336 --> 08:27.507
You can live a fulfilled life.
Pete Buttigieg.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.175
- Oh, Jesus.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.845
- And Rob's friend,
Jay something,

08:31.886 --> 08:33.805
runs that little HVAC shop.

08:33.847 --> 08:37.225
- Oh, God, this conversation.
You're so great.

08:37.267 --> 08:42.355
You know that I'm in love
with Tasha, right?

08:42.397 --> 08:46.234
- Oh. Even with the--

08:47.736 --> 08:51.823
- Not to preach,
but gender stuff,

08:51.865 --> 08:54.034
it's different
than sexuality--

08:54.075 --> 08:58.371
- Oh. Okay.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.956
- Come on, hey,

08:59.998 --> 09:03.376
it's just your generation
with its 84 1/2 genders.

09:05.086 --> 09:09.174
Laugh! Your strongest tool
is thick skin.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.885
Go and show Tasha
your tough side, right?

09:11.926 --> 09:14.387
And put that shiner
to good use.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.306
It was a joke.
Forgive me.

09:16.348 --> 09:20.060
I don't know what's PC anymore.
I got to keep up.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.645
Nolan, come on.
You know I love you.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.428
- Sup?

11:35.653 --> 11:37.489
- Remember the training.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.199
Guard the door.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.295
Aaah--

13:20.258 --> 13:23.386
Aah!

14:21.069 --> 14:25.073
- Hey, I'm here. I'm here.

14:25.115 --> 14:28.326
You're safe. You're safe.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.136
- We used to imagine
what your life was like

14:46.177 --> 14:48.138
outside of the Colony,

14:48.179 --> 14:51.224
but you never really
left Gehenna.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.476
- You know how I caught you?

14:53.518 --> 14:56.646
Your friend has been sharing
your image around

14:56.688 --> 14:58.857
for the whole world to see.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.400
- I don't believe you.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.113
- Carrie, you freak,
I love you!

15:05.155 --> 15:07.198
- You're just a novelty to her.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.868
The outside's
not a welcoming place.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.249
- There's a new Door
opening in West Pine.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.709
The herd that slipped out
with me

15:17.751 --> 15:19.544
tried to let the rest out too.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.546
And I think
it might have worked.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.006
- Remind me how it got out.

15:23.048 --> 15:24.883
- You could help me
close this tear.

15:24.924 --> 15:25.842
- Don't make me
come back there again.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.594
- I don't have to
do this alone.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.688
My father called you
his attack dog.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.648
A dog.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.817
Council points, you follow.

15:42.859 --> 15:46.654
That's how our own people
view us--

15:46.696 --> 15:48.073
animals to the slaughter.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.367
If you don't help me

15:50.408 --> 15:53.119
get the Ledger and learn
how to close this tear,

15:53.161 --> 15:56.081
then all you sacrificed
will have been for waste.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.043
Those children
condemned to death

16:00.085 --> 16:01.836
in the name of the dawn,

16:01.878 --> 16:06.049
those other young Guardians
you led to an early grave.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.178
Can you help me?

16:11.471 --> 16:15.016
Take me back to the Door
so that I can get the Ledger.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.603
Help me.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.777
- Hosea's harsh...

16:25.819 --> 16:27.862
but he's predictable.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.698
You made your bed.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.825
- Arthur.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.159
Arthur!

16:34.327 --> 16:35.495
Hey!

17:04.566 --> 17:06.317
- Dad?

17:18.121 --> 17:19.956
- This is Nolan.
You know what to do.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.666
- Nolan, I need you
to get over here.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.168
Something is following me.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.462
My dad went back to the mine,
Carrie's MIA.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.797
She went off to get
some monster hunting book,

17:27.839 --> 17:29.966
a ledger or something.
I don't fucking know.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.551
I need you superstar.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.428
I'll wait for you here,
but hurry.

17:39.434 --> 17:40.685
Hello?

17:46.524 --> 17:47.776
Hello?

18:13.760 --> 18:16.179
- Try it with this muscle.

18:16.221 --> 18:20.266
When you flex, it puts pressure
on this tendon.

18:20.308 --> 18:23.770
Relax, concentrate.

18:23.812 --> 18:25.730
Close.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.568
Open.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.116
Yeah, you'll need practice.

18:36.157 --> 18:39.703
The research team
I "borrowed" this from

18:39.744 --> 18:41.496
didn't exactly offer guidance.

18:41.538 --> 18:45.000
- I have nothing
but time down here, so...

18:47.377 --> 18:50.171
Has my father asked about me?

18:52.173 --> 18:54.551
- The council
sends their offerings.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.097
You ready to taste something

18:59.139 --> 19:01.683
that will make
your head explode?

19:01.725 --> 19:07.564
This is important--boil your
jerked meat in bone broth.

19:08.231 --> 19:11.317
It rehydrates it
and wakes up the flavor.

19:11.359 --> 19:14.029
Like it's fresh
from the smokehouse.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.947
- I've never seen you
smile before.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.199
I'm concerned.
- Oh, you'll see.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.796
- Can you cut it for me?

19:31.838 --> 19:35.342
- Well, now here's
the best part of your arm.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.469
Remember how to make a fist?

19:49.731 --> 19:51.066
Devil's Bone.

19:51.107 --> 19:53.777
I added it myself.
Keep it sheathed.

19:53.818 --> 19:58.531
And remember, if you strike,
you strike to kill.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.972
All right, we walk from here.

20:23.014 --> 20:24.849
- I'm not moving, Arthur.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.649
- I don't like hurting you.

20:32.691 --> 20:34.693
- No, you just leave that
to the Colony.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.736
- It's not my choice. Up.

20:36.778 --> 20:40.323
- We're the only two to ever
make it out of that hell,

20:40.365 --> 20:43.159
and you swore to protect me.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.787
- I'm sure our fine leader

20:45.829 --> 20:47.706
will spare you
the worst of his fury.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.667
- You don't know my father.
- Oh, don't I?

20:50.709 --> 20:53.461
- Then you know
what he'll do to me.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.631
He'll tie me up...

20:58.550 --> 21:01.261
And gather the whole council
to order

21:01.302 --> 21:03.805
as though
it were the harvest.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.351
- Hosea will search the ends
of the earth for you.

21:08.393 --> 21:11.438
With or without me.

21:11.479 --> 21:16.901
- He'll announce the ceremony
as a lesson in honor.

21:16.943 --> 21:23.408
And as everyone watches,
all of those who raised me,

21:23.450 --> 21:25.326
he'll hand you his knife.

21:25.368 --> 21:27.037
- Stand down, Carrie.

21:27.078 --> 21:30.832
- And you'll have no option,
but to gut me like a fish,

21:30.874 --> 21:34.794
as I beg you for my life.

21:34.836 --> 21:38.006
They'll make a spectacle
of my death.

21:38.048 --> 21:39.799
And you will be my reaper,

21:39.841 --> 21:42.218
the one who swore
to protect all Guardians.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.553
- Silence.
Stand back.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.473
- I don't wanna die
in shame, Arthur.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.559
Will you please spare me that?
- I said silence.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.478
- Gotcha.

21:57.525 --> 22:00.862
Calm mind, steady hand.

22:26.638 --> 22:28.264
- Fuck it.

23:07.095 --> 23:10.515
Who are you?

23:10.557 --> 23:15.311
You a...a big dog?

23:15.353 --> 23:19.024
Big dog, alpha dog?

23:19.065 --> 23:20.942
Big man.

23:20.984 --> 23:24.946
Men don't ask for help.
They take it.

23:27.824 --> 23:30.952
Come on, be a man!

23:32.537 --> 23:37.000
Come on, stand up!

23:37.042 --> 23:39.461
Be a man, come on!

23:43.840 --> 23:46.051
Come on. Come on.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.178
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

23:48.219 --> 23:49.763
Come on!

23:49.804 --> 23:51.765
Come on!

24:00.148 --> 24:01.649
- Fuck my life.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.082
- This is Nolan.
You know what to do.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.569
- Everything is fucking
wonkadonk...

24:46.611 --> 24:49.280
like bad-bad,
and I just need to hear you.

24:49.322 --> 24:50.657
'Cause I'm like...

24:53.118 --> 24:55.787
Yu should be here.
Just give me something.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.161
- Haaaah--

25:36.202 --> 25:38.913
- Aah!

25:51.092 --> 25:52.552
- Aah!

26:02.687 --> 26:03.813
- Stop.

26:03.855 --> 26:06.441
Stop fighting now, Carrie.
Stop.

26:08.318 --> 26:10.028
They won't strip off
your dignity.

26:10.070 --> 26:11.988
I won't let them take that.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.240
- Calmly now.

26:14.282 --> 26:16.826
Soft. You're safe.

26:16.868 --> 26:18.411
You're safe.

26:19.996 --> 26:22.290
- You'll shed your skin
with grace.

26:22.332 --> 26:24.918
This body is a chrysalis

26:24.959 --> 26:27.337
and death is a butterfly,
and you are loved.

26:29.255 --> 26:33.301
Pain is a symptom of sacrifice.

26:33.343 --> 26:37.430
Pain is a symptom
of sacrifice.

26:37.472 --> 26:40.809
Pain...
is a symptom of sacrifice.

26:42.102 --> 26:44.270
- Pain

26:44.312 --> 26:46.940
is a symptom of sacrifice.

28:17.238 --> 28:21.034
Sacrifice is a symptom
of love.

29:10.417 --> 29:13.044
To vast Gehenna,
I give my skin.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.426
both: Pray warm shadow,
let me in.
