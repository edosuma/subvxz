00:18.753 --> 00:21.211
Previously on The Girlfriend Experience:

00:25.885 --> 00:27.009
Hi.

00:27.303 --> 00:28.302
Hi.

00:29.805 --> 00:31.138
Want to get a beer?

00:31.182 --> 00:32.222
Right now?

00:33.726 --> 00:34.767
Yeah.

00:35.895 --> 00:37.937
It's not going to trial, I got it.

00:38.981 --> 00:40.022
Checks go to Quorta.

00:40.066 --> 00:41.982
Still the same.

00:42.026 --> 00:44.026
You've been re-assigned
to Skip Hadderly.

00:44.070 --> 00:45.819
David didn't say.

00:45.863 --> 00:46.987
He must have said something.

00:47.031 --> 00:48.697
He must have given a reason why.

00:48.741 --> 00:50.783
No, he didn't. He doesn't have to.

00:50.826 --> 00:52.952
He just said he wants a new intern.

00:52.995 --> 00:54.203
Just let it go.

00:54.246 --> 00:56.872
Michael amended his will two months ago.

00:56.916 --> 00:59.291
I'm sure you understand
this sets off alarm bells

00:59.335 --> 01:01.001
within his family.

01:01.045 --> 01:04.212
$500,000 was left in the
name of Chelsea Rayne.

01:04.256 --> 01:05.965
Are you Chelsea Rayne?

01:21.232 --> 01:23.357
Don't ever do that again!

01:56.058 --> 01:57.224
Chelsea...

01:57.893 --> 01:58.892
Hi.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.185
Hi.

02:01.063 --> 02:03.063
I thought that was you.

02:03.107 --> 02:04.148
Small world. How have you been?

02:04.191 --> 02:06.400
Good.

02:06.444 --> 02:08.985
It's great seeing you. You
look beautiful as always.

02:09.030 --> 02:10.070
Jack... Alex.

02:10.114 --> 02:11.071
Alex... Jack.

02:11.115 --> 02:12.072
Alex.

02:12.116 --> 02:13.240
Pleasure to meet you.

02:13.993 --> 02:15.909
You guys just had lunch?

02:15.953 --> 02:17.286
You should try the sea
scallops, they're amazing.

02:17.329 --> 02:18.662
I had them last time.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.664
And the escargot? Incredible.

02:22.001 --> 02:24.209
Anyway, I don't mean to intrude.
I just wanted to say hi.

02:25.254 --> 02:26.378
- It's good seeing you.
- You, too.

02:26.964 --> 02:27.963
Take care.

02:28.257 --> 02:29.673
Alex.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.094
We have a problem.

02:34.138 --> 02:36.847
I spoke with Peter
Gramercy, off the record.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.223
Cilic's kids are now aware

02:38.267 --> 02:39.767
that you've been left
half-a-million dollars

02:39.810 --> 02:41.185
of their father's money,

02:41.228 --> 02:43.103
and they're going to fight it.

02:43.147 --> 02:44.688
I could have predicted that.

02:44.732 --> 02:45.981
We should assume they're
gonna do their best

02:46.025 --> 02:47.399
to expose you as an escort,

02:47.443 --> 02:50.110
which could also open you
up to criminal charges.

02:50.154 --> 02:51.361
Do you know what the estate's worth?

02:51.405 --> 02:52.946
Did Gramercy tell you?

02:52.990 --> 02:54.198
Again, off the record,

02:54.241 --> 02:55.908
Twenty-two million.

02:55.951 --> 02:57.284
And they're willing to
drag their father's name

02:57.328 --> 02:59.286
through all of this, for a
fortieth of the estate?

02:59.330 --> 03:00.537
Could be a bluff,

03:00.581 --> 03:03.248
but we should err on
the side of caution.

04:33.132 --> 04:35.966
What was the name of the man
you were with the other day?

04:36.010 --> 04:37.009
Adam?

04:38.220 --> 04:39.303
No, it's Alex.

04:39.346 --> 04:41.180
Oh, Alex. That's right. That's right.

04:43.434 --> 04:45.392
Do you often see...

04:45.436 --> 04:46.560
older men?

04:48.439 --> 04:50.355
I mean I assume he's...

04:50.399 --> 04:51.857
a client of yours, right?

04:51.901 --> 04:53.025
Given his age.

04:55.446 --> 04:56.570
Am I right?

05:01.368 --> 05:03.076
Can I ask you something?

05:04.079 --> 05:05.078
Will you tell me the truth?

05:05.122 --> 05:06.163
Sure.

05:09.460 --> 05:11.376
What's your real name?

05:13.297 --> 05:14.546
It's Annabel.

05:16.967 --> 05:18.217
Where you from?

05:21.347 --> 05:22.554
D.C.

05:23.432 --> 05:25.140
Arlington.

05:28.062 --> 05:29.561
Do you like being an escort?

05:32.233 --> 05:33.232
I met you.

05:45.663 --> 05:47.621
There are four bedrooms, four bathrooms,

05:47.665 --> 05:49.164
and a two-car garage.

05:49.208 --> 05:52.334
The master bedroom is
on the upper level.

05:52.378 --> 05:54.461
The floor to ceiling,
wall-to-wall glass provides

05:54.505 --> 05:57.130
stunning views of the lake.

05:58.133 --> 05:59.383
Look around.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.093
Take your time.

06:28.122 --> 06:30.998
So what do you think?
Would you live here?

06:31.041 --> 06:33.166
Are you kidding? In a heartbeat.

06:33.210 --> 06:34.209
You would?

06:35.587 --> 06:37.629
Are you asking me to move in?

06:39.091 --> 06:40.173
I don't know.

06:40.217 --> 06:41.216
Maybe?

06:46.265 --> 06:48.307
I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding.

06:49.727 --> 06:51.184
But not bad, though, right?

06:51.228 --> 06:52.519
No, it's beautiful.

06:53.731 --> 06:55.314
Some close friends of mine,

06:55.357 --> 06:57.691
Steve, and his wife, Ana,

06:57.735 --> 07:00.652
are throwing a dinner
party this Thursday.

07:02.072 --> 07:03.238
You'd really like them.

07:03.282 --> 07:05.365
Sometimes Steve and I
do business together

07:05.409 --> 07:07.701
and Ana owns The Cermark,

07:07.745 --> 07:10.203
that really cool art
gallery in the West Loop.

07:10.748 --> 07:12.497
So it's a double date?

07:14.043 --> 07:16.501
If you want to think of it that way.

07:16.545 --> 07:18.628
I told them that we've
been seeing each other.

07:20.549 --> 07:21.548
So, will you come?

07:21.592 --> 07:22.632
Yeah?

07:23.135 --> 07:24.718
Yeah.

07:24.762 --> 07:27.679
I mean I have to check my
schedule, but I'm sure it's fine.

07:28.182 --> 07:29.264
Great.

07:31.477 --> 07:33.435
You make me really happy.

07:34.355 --> 07:35.354
You know that?

07:36.190 --> 07:37.189
You, too.

07:39.401 --> 07:41.109
To both of you.

07:42.988 --> 07:44.654
I'm really happy we
finally get to meet you.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.407
Jack's been talking about you for weeks.

07:47.451 --> 07:48.575
Really?

07:50.120 --> 07:53.497
I haven't seen Jack
this happy in a while.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.082
He doesn't deserve you.

07:55.125 --> 07:56.500
Guilty as charged.

07:56.543 --> 07:58.293
You don't deserve me.

08:01.215 --> 08:02.339
New couple!

08:04.218 --> 08:05.425
I'm embarrassed.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.261
I don't know what to say.

08:08.305 --> 08:09.388
Don't be.

08:09.431 --> 08:10.430
He's the one who should be embarrassed,

08:10.474 --> 08:12.182
hiding you away for so long.

08:16.146 --> 08:17.646
Do you want to come back to my place?

08:17.689 --> 08:19.481
I'd love for you to see it.

08:20.150 --> 08:21.149
Okay.

08:27.199 --> 08:28.323
Come in.

08:33.496 --> 08:35.121
Make yourself at home.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.626
Can I get you a drink?

08:40.671 --> 08:41.753
I'm fine.

08:46.802 --> 08:47.801
You sure?

08:48.345 --> 08:49.344
Yeah.

09:02.192 --> 09:03.733
You're gonna go, now?

09:07.197 --> 09:08.613
It's one a.m.

09:08.657 --> 09:11.283
I wasn't expecting to stay the night.

09:13.495 --> 09:16.121
I have something to take
care of in the morning.

09:16.165 --> 09:17.289
Like what?

09:27.384 --> 09:29.468
I had a wonderful time tonight.

09:31.221 --> 09:33.346
I feel very close to you.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.308
I feel very close to you, too.

09:41.607 --> 09:42.772
Will you call me tomorrow?

09:43.567 --> 09:44.566
Yes.

09:45.235 --> 09:46.276
Go to sleep.

10:12.429 --> 10:15.889
I need you to do a clearance
search on these, asap.

10:15.933 --> 10:18.475
Make note of anything that seems
even remotely questionable.

10:18.519 --> 10:19.518
I'm on it.

10:35.911 --> 10:37.536
Hi, what's your name?

10:38.330 --> 10:39.329
Corey.

10:39.373 --> 10:40.997
Hi, Corey, I'm Christine.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.833
I'm having some trouble accessing
some files on the main frame.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.460
May I have your last name?

10:45.504 --> 10:46.711
"Reade." With an "e" on the end.

10:46.755 --> 10:48.880
And which files are
you trying to access?

10:49.550 --> 10:50.882
David Tellis'.

10:52.469 --> 10:55.345
XHP. I just accessed them yesterday.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.267
You don't have authorization anymore.

11:02.229 --> 11:05.939
Your access has been terminated.
You'll need Tellis' approval.

11:06.483 --> 11:07.566
Okay.

11:09.361 --> 11:11.027
- Thank you.
- No problem.

11:29.840 --> 11:32.716
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

12:11.632 --> 12:12.797
Don't take a picture.

12:12.841 --> 12:14.716
This is so cute.

12:19.681 --> 12:21.014
Stop touching me there!

12:21.058 --> 12:23.433
I'm sorry, I'm really ticklish.

12:26.772 --> 12:28.480
It's not funny.

12:28.523 --> 12:29.939
Oh, absolutely not.

12:36.031 --> 12:39.449
My wife and I used to do
this on sailing trips.

12:39.493 --> 12:40.659
You were married?

12:41.912 --> 12:43.787
I should have said "ex-wife".

12:43.830 --> 12:46.706
No, I just never heard you
talk about her before.

12:46.750 --> 12:49.334
I didn't feel like I knew you before.

12:50.504 --> 12:51.670
Well, you do now.

12:53.423 --> 12:54.547
I will admit it.

12:55.967 --> 12:59.010
I do wish you were a
little mad right now.

12:59.054 --> 13:01.554
You want me to trash talk your ex?

13:02.808 --> 13:03.973
I do actually.

13:07.562 --> 13:08.520
No.

13:08.563 --> 13:09.646
No, she's great.

13:11.900 --> 13:13.608
It was me.

13:15.946 --> 13:17.862
It's always about me.

13:18.657 --> 13:19.698
I'm sorry.

13:21.410 --> 13:22.617
Thank you.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.628
What's he offering?

13:35.674 --> 13:37.507
Can you get it higher?

13:37.551 --> 13:38.550
Eighty-five?

13:40.470 --> 13:41.845
Ho-hold on a second.

14:06.997 --> 14:08.079
Okay.

14:14.880 --> 14:15.962
Where are you going?

14:16.006 --> 14:17.630
Back in the water.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.925
You wanna come?

14:20.969 --> 14:22.635
In a minute. I'll watch you.

14:22.679 --> 14:23.678
Your loss!

15:08.725 --> 15:10.141
Don't ever do that again!

15:29.079 --> 15:30.995
- You're getting out?
- I'm done.

15:32.874 --> 15:34.624
I was just playing around.

15:45.136 --> 15:46.469
I have something for you.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.471
What is it?

15:51.226 --> 15:52.225
Show me.

15:56.273 --> 15:58.064
Only if you answer one question.

15:58.108 --> 15:59.524
Go for it.

16:01.736 --> 16:03.361
What happened today?

16:06.283 --> 16:08.783
I have a thing about small spaces.

16:10.078 --> 16:11.244
Sorry.

16:13.248 --> 16:15.957
- When you dunked me...
- No, with the guy.

16:16.793 --> 16:17.917
What guy?

16:19.004 --> 16:22.088
The guy that you were
talking to at the pool.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.716
Did you know him?

16:25.760 --> 16:26.843
No.

16:28.096 --> 16:31.139
He asked me if I was alone, I said "no".

16:32.976 --> 16:34.893
Were you attracted to him?

16:36.313 --> 16:38.605
I was so out of it because you just...

16:38.648 --> 16:40.732
Just answer the question.

16:41.818 --> 16:44.235
I didn't have time to think about it.

16:53.788 --> 16:56.205
I'm so infatuated with you, I-I...

16:58.335 --> 17:00.251
I wasn't even paying attention.

17:00.754 --> 17:01.794
For now.

17:08.053 --> 17:09.218
Here.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.810
I bought the house.

17:19.021 --> 17:20.939
The one overlooking the lake.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.654
I don't know what to say.

17:27.696 --> 17:29.155
I bought it for us.

17:31.201 --> 17:33.284
So that we'd have a place of our own.

17:35.038 --> 17:37.789
So we didn't have to
keep going to hotels.

17:42.379 --> 17:45.004
You can decorate it however you want.

17:48.927 --> 17:50.760
I thought you would like it.

18:02.065 --> 18:05.858
No one's ever done anything
like this for me before.

18:32.137 --> 18:33.761
Can I see you Tuesday?

18:33.805 --> 18:35.221
Yeah, that should be fine.

18:35.265 --> 18:37.849
I'll just check and get back to you.

18:40.729 --> 18:42.729
Last night was incredible.

18:42.772 --> 18:44.063
It was amazing.

18:51.448 --> 18:52.989
I'll get back to you about Tuesday.

19:16.347 --> 19:18.181
Forgot my phone.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.932
Did you leave it upstairs?

19:19.976 --> 19:21.309
I always do this.

19:22.854 --> 19:23.895
Sorry.

19:55.220 --> 19:56.260
Found it.

19:57.055 --> 19:58.096
You'd lose your head...

19:59.516 --> 20:01.432
...if it wasn't screwed on.

20:02.102 --> 20:03.101
It's true.

20:03.353 --> 20:04.769
Bye.

20:20.203 --> 20:22.245
Can I speak with Erin for a moment?

20:22.288 --> 20:23.287
Sure.

20:27.418 --> 20:29.377
- Is it a good time?
- What is it?

20:33.383 --> 20:35.508
I hear you're heading the XHP case now.

20:36.010 --> 20:37.343
Yes.

20:37.387 --> 20:40.471
I'd love to be involved and
help in any way I can.

20:40.515 --> 20:42.348
I was involved when David was heading it

20:42.392 --> 20:44.183
and I'd like to see it through.

20:44.227 --> 20:45.434
It's a bit of a mess right now,

20:45.478 --> 20:47.145
but I'll see what I can do.

20:47.188 --> 20:50.106
If they were smart, you'd be
the new Managing Partner.

20:51.276 --> 20:53.401
Is everything okay
between you and David?

20:54.112 --> 20:55.153
Yeah.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.155
It's fine.

21:04.372 --> 21:05.580
So, how's work?

21:06.416 --> 21:07.498
Fine.

21:07.542 --> 21:09.083
They're on a hiring freeze.

21:09.127 --> 21:11.252
Less positions, more profits.

21:11.296 --> 21:14.005
- Who knows how long...
- Where do you intern again?

21:14.048 --> 21:16.465
A small law firm in midtown.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.342
Peters and Morgan. It's two guys.

21:18.386 --> 21:19.343
It's awful.

21:34.986 --> 21:37.069
You like getting paid
for sex, don't you?

21:37.113 --> 21:38.362
It turns you on.

21:38.406 --> 21:39.488
Getting paid.

21:41.075 --> 21:42.200
Yes!

21:42.994 --> 21:44.160
Say it!

21:44.621 --> 21:46.245
It turns me on.

22:06.476 --> 22:08.184
Take it in all the way.

22:44.389 --> 22:45.471
Hello?

22:45.515 --> 22:48.057
Hey, I miss you already.

22:48.101 --> 22:49.475
How did you get this number?

22:49.519 --> 22:52.103
You gave it to me. What's the problem?

22:52.146 --> 22:54.563
I didn't give you this number, Jack.

23:10.540 --> 23:11.497
Hey.

23:11.541 --> 23:12.623
Hey.

23:13.584 --> 23:15.334
Congrats on the promotion.

23:15.378 --> 23:16.419
Thank you.

23:18.214 --> 23:19.547
So my phone got stolen.

23:19.590 --> 23:21.340
And my sister got some weird texts.

23:21.384 --> 23:23.426
So if you got any weird messages...

23:23.469 --> 23:24.677
I haven't gotten anything.

23:25.179 --> 23:26.387
Okay.

23:30.393 --> 23:32.685
- Well, great news for you.
- Yeah.

23:32.729 --> 23:34.478
- Congratulations again.
- Excuse me.

23:38.609 --> 23:40.359
936...

23:40.403 --> 23:41.694
51...

23:42.196 --> 23:43.321
85...

23:44.073 --> 23:45.364
984...

23:46.075 --> 23:47.241
53...

23:47.285 --> 23:48.409
92...

23:48.703 --> 23:50.286
10...

23:50.580 --> 23:52.121
598...

23:54.375 --> 23:56.292
236...

23:58.129 --> 24:00.629
I'm sorry. I'm gonna
have to call you back.

24:12.602 --> 24:14.268
Christine? Hey, I didn't
hear from you yesterday

24:14.312 --> 24:15.478
and I got worried...

24:35.458 --> 24:38.250
I do not want you in
my fucking life, Jack.

24:38.294 --> 24:39.502
Do you understand?

24:39.545 --> 24:41.545
NEVER CALL ME AGAIN!
