00:22.703 --> 00:24.637
It's freezing out there.

00:24.705 --> 00:26.935
MAN:
You weren't gone long.

00:30.444 --> 00:33.345
Did you do
what I asked?

00:33.413 --> 00:34.971
Yes.

00:35.048 --> 00:37.846
It's important, Gary.

00:37.918 --> 00:40.113
Promise me you did it.

00:40.354 --> 00:41.378
You're sick, Dad.

00:41.455 --> 00:43.047
You should be in a hospital

00:43.123 --> 00:45.921
not stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere.

00:45.992 --> 00:48.620
You don't owe this guy Stites
anything.

00:48.695 --> 00:50.720
It's not about owing.

00:50.797 --> 00:52.128
I freeze my butt off

00:52.332 --> 00:55.631
checking and rechecking
the locks every night.

00:55.669 --> 00:56.727
For what?

00:56.803 --> 00:59.636
You don't need to know.

00:59.673 --> 01:01.971
Yeah, that's for sure.

01:02.042 --> 01:04.340
I'm going to fix some dinner.

01:09.483 --> 01:10.609
( door closes )

01:10.684 --> 01:14.552
( monitor beeping
soft, slowtones )

01:33.140 --> 01:34.937
( windows flapping )

01:35.008 --> 01:37.568
( beeping speeds up )

01:43.617 --> 01:45.676
( fast, rhythmic beeps )

01:45.752 --> 01:46.912
( groans softly )

01:49.823 --> 01:52.849
( groaning weakly )

01:52.926 --> 01:55.918
( monitor beeping faster )

01:58.498 --> 02:01.467
( rapid beeping )

02:06.106 --> 02:08.039
Oh, Lord.

02:08.108 --> 02:11.077
Gary, you didn't--

02:12.212 --> 02:13.975
( microwave beeps )

02:16.616 --> 02:18.550
Oh, whew.

02:21.855 --> 02:24.449
( steady tone )

02:24.524 --> 02:25.718
Oh, God.

02:30.063 --> 02:31.655
Dad?

02:31.731 --> 02:35.690
( steady tone )

02:37.938 --> 02:39.166
( tone stops )

03:04.598 --> 03:06.793
( soft rattling )

04:25.312 --> 04:27.246
DOGGETT :
Agent Scully.

04:32.152 --> 04:34.120
Mmm.

04:34.187 --> 04:36.985
Can I take your coat?

04:37.057 --> 04:39.821
I'm not staying, Agent Doggett.

04:41.895 --> 04:45.262
My doctor told me
to take my maternity leave.

04:45.332 --> 04:48.563
In fact, she insisted on it.

04:48.602 --> 04:50.229
That's not bad, Agent Scully.

04:50.303 --> 04:52.703
You could use some time
for yourself.

05:01.815 --> 05:04.045
What is it?

05:04.117 --> 05:08.747
It's a medallion commemorating
the Apollo 11 space flight.

05:08.822 --> 05:13.259
I'd like to give this
to you, Agent Doggett.

05:13.326 --> 05:15.886
Thanks.

05:19.799 --> 05:22.063
Because?

05:22.135 --> 05:25.298
Agent Mulder gave it to me
a few years back.

05:25.338 --> 05:29.741
It symbolizes teamwork...

05:29.809 --> 05:32.300
partnership.

05:32.379 --> 05:37.407
It means
no one gets there alone.

05:37.651 --> 05:41.018
And after this past year
and...

05:41.054 --> 05:44.820
everything that we've
been through, I just--

05:46.893 --> 05:50.420
I wouldn't be here without you.

06:18.091 --> 06:20.082
Agent Scully.

06:20.160 --> 06:23.960
This pregnancy leave...

06:24.030 --> 06:25.964
it's just a ""leave,'' right?

06:26.032 --> 06:30.969
I mean...you are coming back
eventually?

07:12.112 --> 07:14.171
( footsteps approaching )

07:14.247 --> 07:16.408
You're not gone five minutes,
Agent Scully

07:16.483 --> 07:20.078
and already I'm starting to feel
like a stranger in my own off--

07:20.153 --> 07:21.882
I'm sorry?

07:21.955 --> 07:24.253
Can I help you?

07:24.290 --> 07:26.349
I'm here to help
you, actually.

07:26.426 --> 07:27.859
I'm Leyla Harrison.

07:27.927 --> 07:31.727
I've been looking
forward to meeting you.

07:31.798 --> 07:33.459
Uh-huh.

07:33.533 --> 07:36.400
I've got a case here,
an X-File, I think.

07:36.469 --> 07:38.300
At least the local PD
can't explain it.

07:38.371 --> 07:40.305
A murder last night
in upstate New York.

07:40.373 --> 07:42.841
I booked us on a flight
to Buffalo Niagara.

07:42.909 --> 07:44.137
Here's the crime report.

07:44.210 --> 07:47.338
I'm sorry, Ms. Harrison...

07:47.413 --> 07:48.937
who are you?

07:49.015 --> 07:51.449
Oh, gosh.

07:51.518 --> 07:53.247
They didn't tell you?

07:55.388 --> 07:57.856
This is... so embarrassing.

07:57.924 --> 08:03.123
Uh, I'm... I'm
your new partner.

08:35.595 --> 08:38.530
I asked that the body
be sent to D.C.

08:38.597 --> 08:40.395
It was found
in the woods

08:40.466 --> 08:42.491
about 50 yards
beyond the house.

08:42.568 --> 08:44.434
Maybe we should
begin there.

08:44.504 --> 08:48.065
Let's begin
inside the house.

08:48.141 --> 08:50.336
Okay, then.

08:57.984 --> 09:00.179
The deceased is
Arlen Sacks, aged 72

09:00.253 --> 09:01.845
caretaker for the estate

09:01.921 --> 09:03.912
on which this house
is situated.

09:03.990 --> 09:06.288
There were no signs
of physical trauma

09:06.359 --> 09:07.826
but local PD
suspect homicide

09:07.861 --> 09:09.294
due to the dumping
of the body.

09:09.362 --> 09:11.887
Mr. Sacks was confined
to a wheelchair

09:11.965 --> 09:13.159
the last few months

09:13.199 --> 09:15.531
cared for since then
by his son, Gary

09:15.568 --> 09:17.297
who's their
chief suspect.

09:17.370 --> 09:18.962
Why?

09:19.038 --> 09:22.997
Um... oh, because
he's missing, too.

09:23.076 --> 09:26.068
If he killed this man
without leaving a mark

09:26.145 --> 09:28.010
that would suggest premeditation

09:28.047 --> 09:29.947
an attempt
to disguise the murder.

09:30.016 --> 09:33.144
But that doesn't fit with
dumping the body in the woods

09:33.219 --> 09:34.311
or fleeing the scene

09:34.387 --> 09:36.355
both of which
indicate panic, haste.

09:38.157 --> 09:39.522
That is great.

09:39.592 --> 09:43.028
What was that last part again,
about the premeditation?

09:45.331 --> 09:47.196
What is that?

09:47.267 --> 09:49.360
Slime?

09:49.435 --> 09:53.337
There's a small streak of it
on the floor over there, too.

09:53.406 --> 09:57.308
So, it's not someone;
it's something.

09:57.377 --> 10:01.905
God, this really is an X-File,
isn't it?

10:04.150 --> 10:06.084
Congratulations.

10:13.293 --> 10:15.488
I gave the slime
to the Buffalo PD.

10:15.561 --> 10:18.291
I told them we wanted to see
the results right away.

10:18.331 --> 10:21.300
How much field experience
you have, Agent Harrison?

10:21.334 --> 10:25.361
Um, actually, this is
my first time in the field.

10:25.438 --> 10:26.530
Let me guess--

10:26.606 --> 10:29.131
Deputy Director Kersh
handed you this job

10:29.208 --> 10:31.176
filling in for Agent Scully.

10:31.244 --> 10:33.212
Yes. Yes, he did.

10:33.279 --> 10:35.713
I don't know how to tell
you this, Agent Harrison

10:35.949 --> 10:37.246
but you're being used.

10:37.317 --> 10:39.615
Deputy Director Kersh is
no friend to the X-Files.

10:39.686 --> 10:42.678
I don't think you understand
something, Agent Doggett.

10:42.722 --> 10:44.587
I begged for this assignment.

10:44.657 --> 10:46.352
You begged for it.

10:46.426 --> 10:48.394
I was in Accounting.

10:48.428 --> 10:51.522
I processed Agents Mulder
and Scully's travel expenses.

10:51.597 --> 10:54.293
Then you are qualified.

10:54.367 --> 10:56.562
Maybe I'm not

10:56.636 --> 11:00.595
but I know the X-Files,
Agent Doggett, inside and out.

11:00.640 --> 11:03.666
Other people don't even want
to admit these questions exist

11:03.743 --> 11:05.267
but you face them every day.

11:05.345 --> 11:08.974
I am just so excited
to be a part of this.

11:09.048 --> 11:10.447
Aren't you?

11:26.265 --> 11:28.062
Mr. Sack's body was found here

11:28.134 --> 11:30.625
but they found no
footprints leading to it.

11:33.239 --> 11:34.331
Oh, my God.

11:34.407 --> 11:35.738
There's more of it.

11:36.509 --> 11:37.737
Looks like it.

11:37.977 --> 11:39.444
You know what
that could be?

11:39.512 --> 11:40.479
It could be bile.

11:44.417 --> 11:45.611
Bile?

11:45.685 --> 11:47.175
From a liver-eating mutant.

11:47.253 --> 11:48.720
Mulder and Scully
chased one

11:48.788 --> 11:50.085
into an escalator once.

11:50.156 --> 11:51.646
It died, but,
but there was--

11:51.724 --> 11:54.522
This is not a liver-eating
mutant, Agent Harrison.

11:54.594 --> 11:57.188
It could be an alien
who shed its skin.

11:57.263 --> 11:59.493
According to Agent
Mulder's case reports

11:59.565 --> 12:00.554
they leave behind

12:00.633 --> 12:02.692
a mucous-like residue
when they, uh--

12:06.506 --> 12:08.667
You don't think
it's that either.

12:08.741 --> 12:10.800
I'll take a
sample of this.

12:11.044 --> 12:13.535
Have it sent to the
lab for comparison.

12:13.579 --> 12:15.547
That's good thinking,
Agent Harrison.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.381
( rumbling )

12:42.842 --> 12:44.309
( knocking )

12:44.377 --> 12:45.309
Hey.

12:45.378 --> 12:46.470
Ready to roll?

12:46.546 --> 12:48.104
Yeah. I'lljust get my keys.

12:50.850 --> 12:52.215
Hey. Don't forget this.

12:52.285 --> 12:53.377
Relax the back.

12:53.453 --> 12:54.715
Breathe in, breathe out.

12:54.787 --> 12:56.186
( forceful panting )

12:56.255 --> 12:58.655
How do you know all
these things, Mulder?

12:58.691 --> 13:00.090
I'm unemployed.

13:00.159 --> 13:02.753
I got a lot of time on my hands.

13:02.829 --> 13:04.091
Oprah.

13:04.163 --> 13:06.063
I watch a lot of Oprah.

13:06.132 --> 13:09.863
Thank you for doing
this with me.

13:10.069 --> 13:12.060
What's the matter?

13:13.739 --> 13:16.503
I don't know. I, uh--

13:18.444 --> 13:20.378
Maybe it's hormones or--

13:22.882 --> 13:24.474
This is just--

13:24.550 --> 13:27.519
I'm just feeling so
strange about all this.

13:27.587 --> 13:30.715
This having a baby, this?

13:30.790 --> 13:32.758
No... no.

13:35.261 --> 13:37.195
Leaving work, I guess.

13:37.263 --> 13:41.131
I mean, I... I walked
out of that office today

13:41.200 --> 13:43.191
feeling like a deserter.

13:43.269 --> 13:45.737
You've paid your
dues there, Scully.

13:45.805 --> 13:47.363
More than paid them.

13:49.642 --> 13:52.372
You're concerned about
Agent Doggett.

13:57.183 --> 14:00.311
You know the entire time
that I was down there

14:00.386 --> 14:02.445
I had someone
to watch my back.

14:02.522 --> 14:06.424
I'm betting thatAgent Doggett
can take care of himself.

14:06.492 --> 14:08.119
He's a big boy.

14:09.328 --> 14:11.728
You've got to worry
about the little boy

14:11.797 --> 14:13.788
or little girl.

14:13.866 --> 14:16.130
Boy?

14:16.202 --> 14:17.533
Or girl?

16:22.662 --> 16:23.788
Whoa.

16:27.033 --> 16:29.558
Agent Harrison,
what are you doing here?

16:29.635 --> 16:31.535
I followed the tr--

16:32.872 --> 16:35.864
It's here.

16:35.941 --> 16:37.306
It?

16:37.376 --> 16:39.367
What ""it''?

16:39.445 --> 16:41.310
You're armed, right?

16:47.620 --> 16:49.952
What do you want
me to do?

16:55.728 --> 16:57.423
I want you to go outside

16:57.496 --> 17:00.397
and I want you to stand
by the front door.

17:00.466 --> 17:04.960
Whatever it is, I'm going
to try and flush it out.

17:08.941 --> 17:10.339
Agent Harrison.

17:12.345 --> 17:13.972
Take the safety off.

17:35.468 --> 17:37.402
( soft rattling )

17:50.616 --> 17:53.517
( gunshots )

17:58.891 --> 17:59.983
Harrison.

18:02.528 --> 18:03.722
Agent Harrison!

18:35.127 --> 18:38.096
( creaking )

19:04.957 --> 19:07.221
( telephone ringing )

19:07.460 --> 19:08.222
Skinner.

19:08.461 --> 19:09.223
Is it true?

19:09.462 --> 19:10.224
Agent Scully.

19:10.463 --> 19:11.691
I can't reach Agent Doggett

19:11.764 --> 19:13.664
and someone told me
he's gone missing.

19:13.732 --> 19:14.858
He was investigating a murder.

19:14.934 --> 19:15.901
He hasn't reported back.

19:15.968 --> 19:17.697
Why wasn't I told?

19:17.736 --> 19:18.896
Agent Scully, don't worry.

19:18.971 --> 19:20.802
I'm heading
into the Bureau right now.

19:20.873 --> 19:21.805
No, you're not.

19:21.874 --> 19:23.239
Sir, are you ordering me

19:23.476 --> 19:25.603
not to go looking
for Agent Doggett?

19:25.678 --> 19:29.239
I've got every available
law-enforcement officer out here.

19:29.482 --> 19:31.074
You're on maternity leave now.

19:31.116 --> 19:34.552
Just trust that we're doing
everything that we know to do.

19:34.620 --> 19:36.144
I know that you are...

19:36.222 --> 19:39.623
but what if it's not enough?

21:30.002 --> 21:31.731
- I'lljust take this to the lab.
- Thank you.

21:34.239 --> 21:36.207
Seems like old times.

21:36.241 --> 21:39.267
You in scrubs,
slicing and dicing.

21:39.345 --> 21:41.711
What are you doing here, Mulder?

21:41.780 --> 21:45.113
Actually I-I wandered
away from my tour.

21:47.753 --> 21:50.051
A better question is,
what are you doing here?

21:51.223 --> 21:53.157
I found something
that may prove helpful

21:53.225 --> 21:54.658
in locating Agent Doggett.

21:54.727 --> 21:56.058
This is Arlen Sacks

21:56.095 --> 21:59.394
the murder victim
Doggett was investigating.

21:59.598 --> 22:01.691
This old man was not
murdered, Mulder.

22:01.767 --> 22:04.895
He died of heart failure,
evidently after he was blinded

22:04.937 --> 22:06.928
by a chemical substance
of some kind.

22:07.006 --> 22:09.406
The orbits have...

22:09.642 --> 22:13.976
residual traces
of a slimy substance...

22:14.046 --> 22:17.709
known as hydrolytic enzymes.

22:17.783 --> 22:18.306
Venom. Produced by reptiles.

22:18.384 --> 22:19.373
How'd you know that?

22:19.618 --> 22:21.279
Before Agent Doggett
and his partner

22:21.320 --> 22:24.118
went missing, they sent
in samples to be analyzed.

22:24.156 --> 22:26.147
Hydrolytic enzymes.
Skinner told me.

22:26.225 --> 22:29.683
I, uh, also found some bacteria
in the venom

22:29.762 --> 22:32.322
which I'm going to do
a culture on.

22:32.398 --> 22:33.865
Let somebody else do it.

22:35.934 --> 22:38.129
There are other
concerns right now.

22:39.371 --> 22:41.339
I know, but this is
an X-File, Mulder

22:41.407 --> 22:44.672
and you are out of the Bureau,
and now if I go home

22:44.743 --> 22:48.907
where is Skinner going to find
someone qualified to look into this?

22:48.981 --> 22:51.814
I know where he
could find somebody.

22:54.053 --> 22:55.850
( clattering )

23:10.969 --> 23:12.334
( raspy crunching )

23:28.220 --> 23:29.778
( chittering sound)

24:15.234 --> 24:17.759
( gate opens )

24:17.836 --> 24:19.428
Agent Doggett?

24:19.505 --> 24:20.529
I'm right here.

24:23.509 --> 24:25.739
Are you all right?

24:25.811 --> 24:28.006
It sprayed my eyes
with something.

24:28.080 --> 24:30.173
My vision's all blurry.

24:30.249 --> 24:31.841
Makes two of us.

24:31.917 --> 24:34.750
Three, actually.

24:52.171 --> 24:56.164
HARRISON: I think it's Gary Sacks,
the son of the murder victim.

24:56.241 --> 24:58.004
How'd you get down here?

24:58.076 --> 25:00.476
I think it dragged me down here.
I'm not sure.

25:02.881 --> 25:04.246
So what do
we do now?

25:04.316 --> 25:06.910
I don't know.

25:06.985 --> 25:11.251
Mulder and Scully investigated
a case once in Florida.

25:11.323 --> 25:13.314
It involved subterranean men

25:13.392 --> 25:15.087
who took people underground.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.593
This is not a man.

25:16.829 --> 25:19.195
I fell through
some kind of trap.

25:19.264 --> 25:21.027
I'm guessing
somebody put that there

25:21.099 --> 25:22.930
to provide live meals
for this thing.

25:23.001 --> 25:25.333
You're not saying
that includes us?

25:25.404 --> 25:28.840
I don't intend to wait around
and find out.

25:28.907 --> 25:30.499
These tunnels were built
by bootleggers

25:30.576 --> 25:31.975
back in Prohibition.

25:32.044 --> 25:35.343
There's got to be one
that leads back to the house.

25:35.414 --> 25:37.245
Something up there,
I think.

25:37.282 --> 25:39.842
Some kind of light.

25:42.187 --> 25:45.384
I can't tell how high
up that is.

26:01.106 --> 26:03.540
Mulder, you're not supposed
to be out here.

26:03.609 --> 26:05.133
I'm not out here.

26:05.177 --> 26:07.441
What happened
to the search?

26:07.479 --> 26:09.379
Police in West Seneca
found Doggett's car

26:09.448 --> 26:12.212
parked at a convenience store
about a half hour from here.

26:12.284 --> 26:14.013
How'd it get there?

26:14.086 --> 26:17.852
I don't know, but we're
redirecting our search.

26:24.062 --> 26:25.222
Where are you going?

26:25.297 --> 26:26.992
I think I'll take
a walk in the woods.

26:27.032 --> 26:28.499
We've already had
40 people looking

26:28.533 --> 26:29.591
around out
there, Mulder.

26:29.668 --> 26:30.600
What the hell?

26:30.669 --> 26:32.237
I'm out of a job
already, right?

26:32.237 --> 26:33.226
I'm out of a job
already, right?

26:33.338 --> 26:33.895
( grunting )

27:03.702 --> 27:06.193
( grunting )

27:31.430 --> 27:33.022
( grunting )

27:42.607 --> 27:44.734
( metallic clinking )

27:47.245 --> 27:49.611
MAN:
Thought all you people left.

27:52.517 --> 27:55.213
You are?

27:55.287 --> 27:57.585
Herman Stites.
I own this property.

27:57.656 --> 28:01.956
You're just the man I wanted
to speak to, Mr. Stites.

28:01.994 --> 28:04.292
Have you seen anything
unusual around here?

28:04.329 --> 28:06.627
Unusual? How?

28:06.665 --> 28:10.624
Dangerous animals...

28:10.702 --> 28:11.964
reptiles.

28:12.004 --> 28:13.130
I'm confused.

28:13.171 --> 28:15.071
I thought the police
were looking for a man.

28:15.140 --> 28:17.074
Arlen's son, Gary.

28:17.142 --> 28:19.474
That is what
they're looking for.

28:30.756 --> 28:32.519
Agent Doggett?

28:32.557 --> 28:33.785
I'm all right.

28:40.499 --> 28:42.490
MULDER:
I don't think Gary Sacks committed

28:42.567 --> 28:43.727
this murder, Mr. Stites.

28:43.802 --> 28:45.292
I think he may be
a victim himself.

28:45.370 --> 28:49.033
I didn't catch
your name, Agent.

28:49.107 --> 28:53.635
Kersh, Alvin Kersh.

28:53.712 --> 28:56.203
I'm a scientist,
Mr. Kersh.

28:56.281 --> 28:57.805
What kind of a scientist
are you?

28:58.050 --> 28:58.812
A biologist

28:59.051 --> 29:00.575
so I know something
about animals.

29:00.652 --> 29:03.815
They don't generally
carry men off into the woods

29:04.056 --> 29:05.250
like poor Mr. Sacks.

29:05.323 --> 29:08.656
I don't think this was
an animal.

29:08.727 --> 29:10.160
I think it was a man

29:10.228 --> 29:13.595
using some kind of reptile venom
to blind them first.

29:13.665 --> 29:15.565
That would be
quite a trick.

29:15.634 --> 29:18.068
You'd really have
to know what you were doing.

29:18.136 --> 29:21.299
You'd have to be,
say, a scientist.

29:21.339 --> 29:24.467
Are you accusing me
of something, Mr. Kersh?

29:24.543 --> 29:30.504
No. I'm just thinking
out loud, Mr. Stites.

29:43.061 --> 29:44.619
( grunting )

30:03.215 --> 30:05.274
I need a hand.

30:25.770 --> 30:28.204
Agent Doggett, what happened?

30:28.273 --> 30:30.537
I lost my grip

30:30.609 --> 30:33.442
with a little help
from the man upstairs.

30:33.478 --> 30:34.467
( distant clang )

30:37.315 --> 30:38.304
Hey!

30:40.152 --> 30:41.176
Hey!

30:41.253 --> 30:43.244
Hey!

30:43.321 --> 30:44.253
I'm a federal agent!

30:51.930 --> 30:53.761
I don't understand.

30:53.832 --> 30:57.598
Why would he want
to keep us down here?

30:57.669 --> 31:00.934
You wanted to face the unknown,
Agent Harrison.

31:01.173 --> 31:02.936
Well, you're facing it now.

31:03.175 --> 31:05.575
But who is he?

31:05.644 --> 31:08.477
Some kind of scientist,
I think.

31:08.547 --> 31:11.607
I saw some books
and papers on biology

31:11.683 --> 31:12.945
in his library.

31:13.185 --> 31:17.281
It could be some kind
of symbiotic relationship

31:17.355 --> 31:19.653
between this man
and this creature.

31:19.724 --> 31:20.748
Mulder and Scully--

31:20.825 --> 31:21.849
Mulder and Scully

31:21.927 --> 31:24.191
aren't here, Agent Harrison,
we are.

31:24.262 --> 31:28.392
And wild speculation isn't going
to help us find a way out.

31:28.433 --> 31:32.392
You think I'm pretty foolish,
don't you?

31:34.773 --> 31:38.607
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you want to take leaps

31:38.677 --> 31:41.168
that aren't supported
by the facts.

31:41.246 --> 31:45.307
What I want
you to do is

31:45.383 --> 31:47.180
stay with that guy right there

31:47.252 --> 31:48.981
while I look
for another way out.

31:49.221 --> 31:51.246
If this thing
comes near you...

31:51.323 --> 31:54.417
I want you to shoot.

32:04.970 --> 32:06.494
Agent Doggett.

32:10.008 --> 32:11.532
He's gone.

32:12.944 --> 32:14.741
What do you mean he's gone?

32:16.715 --> 32:17.739
I don't know.

32:17.816 --> 32:19.716
It must have taken him.

32:35.667 --> 32:37.225
( phone ringing )

32:40.372 --> 32:41.339
Mulder.

32:41.406 --> 32:42.668
Mulder, what are you doing?

32:42.741 --> 32:45.369
I'm spitting sunflower shells
on Herman Stites's driveway.

32:45.443 --> 32:46.774
What are you doing, Scully?

32:46.811 --> 32:49.439
I just got off
the phone with Skinner

32:49.514 --> 32:50.674
who is furious.

32:50.749 --> 32:52.478
This man Stites just called him
saying that

32:52.550 --> 32:54.814
you've been impersonating
Deputy Director Kersh

32:54.886 --> 32:56.820
and making baseless accusations.

32:56.888 --> 32:58.014
What's he mad about

32:58.256 --> 33:00.918
me impersonating Kersh
or me harassing Stites?

33:00.992 --> 33:03.961
Mulder, the victim had
reptile venom in his eyes.

33:03.995 --> 33:05.257
Are you now saying

33:05.330 --> 33:07.423
that it was a man who did this?

33:07.499 --> 33:08.932
What are you saying it is,
Scully?

33:09.000 --> 33:10.865
I know this may be hard
to believe

33:10.935 --> 33:11.993
coming from me

33:12.070 --> 33:14.004
but some kind
of reptile attack is

33:14.072 --> 33:18.008
the only explanation consistent
with the scientific evidence.

33:18.076 --> 33:20.544
I don't think it's a monster
that we're dealing with here.

33:20.612 --> 33:21.636
I think it is a man.

33:21.680 --> 33:22.942
And why do you say that?

33:23.014 --> 33:24.481
You regifted.

33:24.516 --> 33:25.881
I'm sorry?

33:25.950 --> 33:27.941
My Apollo medallion.

33:28.019 --> 33:30.078
You found it?

33:30.322 --> 33:33.450
Yeah. I found it on the grass
on Stites's estate.

33:33.525 --> 33:35.891
Doggett must be
around here somewhere.

33:35.927 --> 33:37.895
( door opens )

33:37.929 --> 33:39.362
Agent Scully?

33:39.397 --> 33:40.659
I got to go.

33:46.838 --> 33:48.305
What am I looking at?

33:48.373 --> 33:49.601
As you asked

33:49.674 --> 33:52.643
we cultured the bacteria
from the hydrolytic enzymes

33:52.711 --> 33:55.373
that were sprayed
into the old man's eyes.

33:55.447 --> 33:57.039
Looks like they're
breaking down the tissue.

33:57.115 --> 33:58.605
That's exactly
what they're doing.

33:58.683 --> 34:01.481
The venom blinds its victim,
then the bacteria excretes

34:01.553 --> 34:04.454
protease and collagenase
throughout the victim's body.

34:04.522 --> 34:05.955
Digestive enzymes.

34:06.024 --> 34:09.721
Muscle, bone,
all of it is slowly liquefied

34:09.793 --> 34:11.022
for easy digestion

34:11.096 --> 34:14.395
while the victim's skin
is made hard and brittle

34:14.466 --> 34:15.899
forming a sack or shell

34:15.967 --> 34:17.867
from which the
reptile can drink.

34:17.936 --> 34:19.801
So the reptile sprays
its victim

34:19.871 --> 34:21.862
and then all it has
to do is wait.

34:21.940 --> 34:24.737
There are precedents
for this sort of thing in nature.

34:24.809 --> 34:30.804
Yeah, but there are no species
that can do all of this.

34:30.882 --> 34:32.509
At least not yet.

34:32.583 --> 34:34.518
What do you mean?

34:45.929 --> 34:49.127
Talk about the blind
leading the blind.

34:49.367 --> 34:52.393
I owe you an apology,
Agent Doggett.

34:52.469 --> 34:54.563
You're doing fine,
Agent Harrison.

34:54.639 --> 34:55.867
Hang tough.

34:55.907 --> 34:57.033
You were right.

34:57.108 --> 34:58.666
I'm not qualified.

35:01.613 --> 35:05.447
We're going to find a way
out of here, Agent Harrison.

35:05.517 --> 35:07.178
I don't think I am.

35:09.921 --> 35:13.584
Why, what is it?

35:13.658 --> 35:15.592
Whatever happened to Sacks--

35:15.660 --> 35:17.628
I think it's happening to me.

35:17.662 --> 35:19.789
I'm completely blind now.

35:22.066 --> 35:24.000
( moist, squishy noises )

35:29.774 --> 35:32.709
( gunshots )

35:41.186 --> 35:43.984
Oh, God,
Agent Doggett!

35:50.695 --> 35:53.163
I think it's Gary Sacks.

36:00.104 --> 36:03.562
( ringing )

36:03.641 --> 36:04.835
Mulder.

36:04.876 --> 36:08.039
You were right
about Herman Stites, Mulder.

36:08.112 --> 36:09.636
What'd you find?

36:09.714 --> 36:11.875
Stites is a crypto-biologist

36:11.916 --> 36:13.884
specializing
in reptile genetics.

36:13.918 --> 36:15.442
Listen to this:

36:15.520 --> 36:18.080
It says here that he published
a monograph last year

36:18.156 --> 36:19.680
claiming to be on the verge

36:19.757 --> 36:22.726
of creating
a new species of reptile.

36:22.794 --> 36:24.489
You don't think
he succeeded, do you?

36:24.562 --> 36:25.790
I don't know.

36:25.864 --> 36:28.094
He dropped out of sight
and never published a follow-up.

36:28.166 --> 36:32.466
But, Mulder,
the bacteria inside this venom--

36:32.537 --> 36:35.267
if Stites is genetically
altering reptile breeds

36:35.473 --> 36:38.499
it may explain
the peculiar properties.

36:41.513 --> 36:43.606
Mulder, are you listening to me?

36:46.251 --> 36:47.616
Mulder?

36:49.587 --> 36:51.714
Mulder?

36:51.789 --> 36:55.156
I think Mr. Stites might have
a lot more than that to explain.

36:59.831 --> 37:03.130
Mulder? Mulder?

37:35.967 --> 37:38.333
Mr. Stites!

37:38.570 --> 37:40.128
Mr. Stites, open up!

37:40.204 --> 37:42.764
Mr. Stites,
open the door!

37:42.840 --> 37:46.241
( pounding )

37:46.311 --> 37:47.903
Mr. Stites!

38:05.997 --> 38:07.897
Mr. Stites!

38:13.671 --> 38:15.138
( pounding continues )

38:18.743 --> 38:19.937
Mr. Stites!

38:26.351 --> 38:27.875
( dialing )

38:30.622 --> 38:31.589
What do you want?

38:34.759 --> 38:37.091
Where is it,
Mr. Stites?

38:37.161 --> 38:38.958
This thing
you're protecting--

38:39.030 --> 38:40.361
this creature of yours?

38:40.598 --> 38:42.065
I don't think
you meant for it to

38:42.133 --> 38:43.327
but it got out last night

38:43.401 --> 38:45.266
and attacked
the caretaker and his son

38:45.303 --> 38:47.100
and then
it attacked my colleagues.

38:48.906 --> 38:50.601
Now, I can have
50 men in here

38:50.642 --> 38:52.610
to comb this place
within the hour.

38:54.312 --> 38:57.110
Where are they, Mr. Stites?

38:59.150 --> 39:00.242
( gasps )

39:00.318 --> 39:02.013
It's all right.

39:02.086 --> 39:03.644
It's just me.

39:06.024 --> 39:08.117
Doesn't make any damn sense.

39:08.192 --> 39:10.820
There's no exit
except that door.

39:10.895 --> 39:12.920
Maybe it does.

39:12.997 --> 39:14.123
( pounding )

39:14.198 --> 39:15.392
MULDER:
Agent Doggett?

39:15.633 --> 39:16.827
Right here!

39:20.071 --> 39:21.265
It's all right,
Agent Doggett.

39:21.339 --> 39:22.863
We're going to
get you out of here.

39:23.975 --> 39:25.067
Who's that with you?

39:25.143 --> 39:27.008
It's the man
that lives here.

39:27.045 --> 39:28.774
He's been protecting this thing.

39:28.846 --> 39:30.040
He's kept us down here.

39:30.081 --> 39:31.412
- Agent Doggett, I know--
- It's him.

39:31.649 --> 39:34.209
He's not protecting it.

39:34.285 --> 39:36.651
He is it.

39:47.098 --> 39:48.656
Agent Mulder?

40:00.278 --> 40:02.246
Agent Doggett,
I don't have a weapon.

40:02.313 --> 40:03.780
I'm coming to get yours.

40:07.151 --> 40:09.176
No, I'm not.

40:09.253 --> 40:11.221
Mulder, I can't see.

40:12.757 --> 40:13.781
Mulder, where is it?

40:13.858 --> 40:15.223
It's right above you.

40:19.464 --> 40:20.488
It's coming this way.

40:22.900 --> 40:24.333
Where, Mulder? I can't see!

40:24.402 --> 40:25.232
Aim down.

40:28.039 --> 40:29.131
Aim at the sound of my voice.

40:29.207 --> 40:30.196
No, I'll shoot you!

40:30.241 --> 40:31.071
You're not going to shoot me.

40:31.142 --> 40:31.801
I can't see!

40:31.876 --> 40:32.968
Aim at the sound of my voice.

40:33.044 --> 40:34.011
Where is it?

40:34.045 --> 40:35.740
Aim at me!

40:35.813 --> 40:36.507
Fire when I tell you to fire.

40:36.714 --> 40:36.975
No!

40:37.048 --> 40:38.015
Fire!

40:38.049 --> 40:38.413
( gunfire )

40:42.987 --> 40:44.921
Agent Mulder?

40:46.724 --> 40:48.487
Agent Mulder?

40:51.262 --> 40:53.787
I'm right here.

40:53.865 --> 40:56.425
I'm right here,
Agent Doggett.

41:37.241 --> 41:38.538
SCULLY:
Agent Doggett?

41:40.244 --> 41:41.438
Is this it?

41:41.512 --> 41:44.140
- No.
- No.

41:44.215 --> 41:45.580
We just came by

41:45.817 --> 41:47.182
to visit
Agent Harrison.

41:47.218 --> 41:48.776
How is she?

41:48.853 --> 41:52.050
She's on the same
antivenin treatment I got.

41:52.123 --> 41:53.988
Her eyesight's
pretty much back.

41:54.058 --> 41:56.322
Doctors say she's going
to be fine, physically.

41:56.394 --> 41:59.329
Skinner said she won't
be returning to the X-Files.

41:59.397 --> 42:00.864
That was her choice.

42:00.898 --> 42:03.196
Just going to be
me for a while.

42:07.138 --> 42:10.073
I want to return something
to you

42:10.107 --> 42:13.099
that I think you deserve
to keep.

42:13.144 --> 42:14.611
I appreciate the gesture

42:14.846 --> 42:16.837
but if it's all
the same to you

42:16.914 --> 42:20.406
there's someone else
who should have it.

42:23.287 --> 42:24.276
No way.

42:27.024 --> 42:28.252
This means--

42:28.292 --> 42:32.388
I can't tell you
what this means to me.

42:38.336 --> 42:40.201
Can I ask you something?

42:42.173 --> 42:43.936
Sure.

42:44.008 --> 42:47.535
When you went to Antarctica

42:47.612 --> 42:51.946
to save Agent Scully from
being taken by that spaceship

42:52.016 --> 42:55.076
and you ran out of gas
in your Snow-Cat--

42:55.152 --> 42:56.642
how did you get back?

42:58.923 --> 43:01.949
Um, well, first of all

43:02.026 --> 43:05.189
it was never actually proven
that it was a spaceship.

43:05.263 --> 43:06.287
It wasn't?

43:06.364 --> 43:10.994
No, what happened was that

43:11.068 --> 43:14.868
we fell off of something
that rose out of the ice.

43:14.906 --> 43:16.897
And what do you
think that was?

43:16.974 --> 43:18.202
Well, I don't know
what it was

43:18.276 --> 43:20.141
but we didn't actually
see a spaceship.

43:20.211 --> 43:22.145
I can't believe you're saying
it's not a spaceship.

43:22.213 --> 43:23.373
It could have
been a spaceship.

43:23.414 --> 43:24.540
Of course it
was a spaceship.

43:24.615 --> 43:26.048
We don't know that it--

43:26.083 --> 43:27.641
But you don't have
a picture of it or anything.

43:27.885 --> 43:29.352
You know it was a spaceship.
You saw it.

43:29.420 --> 43:31.251
No, no, remember,
I was unconscious.

43:31.289 --> 43:32.256
And when I woke up

43:32.290 --> 43:33.348
there was no spaceship.

43:33.424 --> 43:36.393
Mulder, no, no, no.

43:36.460 --> 43:38.052
And you were frozen.

43:38.129 --> 43:40.063
And remember,
I hugged you

43:40.131 --> 43:42.099
until you were not
frozen anymore--

43:43.305 --> 43:49.680
