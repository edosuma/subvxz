00:07.119 --> 00:08.108
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:08.320 --> 00:10.845
Do you want to catch a movie
tomorrow night?

00:11.056 --> 00:14.048
- You applied for the space program?
- My second year.

00:14.260 --> 00:19.129
Tonight's dinner is semi-formal.
So any slinky black number will do.

00:19.331 --> 00:22.198
You want me to conduct a study
at County General.

00:22.401 --> 00:24.699
And the drug is for the treatment
of fracture pain?

00:24.904 --> 00:26.963
Comparing it against
acetaminophen with codeine.

00:27.173 --> 00:30.574
- What's your son's medical condition?
- ALD, Adrenoleukodystrophy.

00:30.776 --> 00:32.334
- How old is he?
- Eight. Why?

00:32.545 --> 00:34.012
They usually don't make it past 10.

00:34.246 --> 00:36.942
This must be Ricky. I'm Carol.

00:44.156 --> 00:46.590
I could have taken
Lucy out for a pizza.

00:46.792 --> 00:50.057
That's what my Residents did
when I finished a rotation.

00:50.262 --> 00:53.993
In my day, Residents always had
their students over for a meal.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.225
Makes for better mentoring.

00:56.936 --> 00:59.166
That's why I invited Peter to join us.

00:59.672 --> 01:00.866
Dr. Benton's coming?

01:01.073 --> 01:03.871
He was your Resident.
Now Lucy's working with him.

01:04.075 --> 01:07.807
It's much more civilized.
John, don't! No, no, no.

01:08.013 --> 01:10.106
I thought peppers went in the blender.

01:10.316 --> 01:12.750
- We run separate colors for the sauce.
- Good save.

01:12.952 --> 01:17.321
You cool and peel them first.
Why don't you seed the Persian cukes?

01:17.523 --> 01:21.050
You know, it's funny. I'm actually
gonna miss having Lucy around.

01:21.260 --> 01:22.284
That's how it works.

01:22.494 --> 01:25.486
The instant students know enough
to be of use...

01:25.698 --> 01:28.189
...they move to another rotation.

01:29.702 --> 01:32.136
Lengthwise. Lengthwise.

01:33.906 --> 01:36.340
And then you seed them. Okay?

01:37.810 --> 01:41.439
Emergency medicine may not be
a bad choice for Lucy.

01:41.647 --> 01:46.175
Well, she might feel differently after
she has her Surgical rotation.

01:47.720 --> 01:51.816
You know what? Why don't you...?
Why don't you chill the Pinot Grigio?

01:55.427 --> 01:57.452
In the freezer?

01:58.163 --> 02:00.563
IKeep your day job, Carter.

02:00.766 --> 02:03.701
Well, let's see how you handle these.
Got it?

02:04.003 --> 02:05.561
All right, let's do it.

02:06.372 --> 02:08.704
Do you have inside information
on this drug?

02:08.907 --> 02:10.842
- This stuff really works?
- Amazing.

02:11.043 --> 02:14.035
Aaron broke his arm before,
the pain was excruciating.

02:14.246 --> 02:16.180
I'd like to buy stock in this.

02:16.382 --> 02:18.680
This may be acetaminophen
with codeine.

02:18.884 --> 02:22.012
I know some patients in the
study aren't getting the wonder drug.

02:22.221 --> 02:25.418
Aaron is, and it's remarkable stuff.

02:25.624 --> 02:26.989
They keep docs in the dark?

02:27.192 --> 02:30.593
It's a double-blind study. Get your
"insider trading" elsewhere.

02:30.796 --> 02:32.229
See you in three weeks.

02:32.431 --> 02:35.059
- Jeanie's gonna be late.
- Probably stuck in the snow.

02:35.267 --> 02:37.167
She overslept. Had a late night.

02:37.369 --> 02:38.301
I wish we did.

02:38.504 --> 02:43.032
We are going to kick-start the a.m.
With a wake-up call from my main men:

02:43.242 --> 02:45.767
- Hetfield and Hammett.
- It's coming down.

02:45.978 --> 02:48.640
I didn't expect to see you today.
The clinic's closed.

02:48.847 --> 02:51.941
I organized a seminar on STDs
and cervical cancer.

02:52.151 --> 02:54.346
A gab session
for women in the community.

02:54.553 --> 02:55.747
That's a great idea.

02:55.955 --> 02:57.388
Is that Metallica?

02:57.589 --> 02:59.614
You're a metalhead?
You know this tune?

02:59.825 --> 03:02.453
Yeah. Because it's banned
in my house.

03:02.661 --> 03:06.153
I thought women should know more
about screening and prevention.

03:06.365 --> 03:08.697
Absolutely.
I wish I could pay you overtime.

03:08.901 --> 03:12.029
Don't worry. I scored
some grant money to pay for it.

03:12.237 --> 03:13.261
Really?

03:13.572 --> 03:14.971
That'll run through the clinic?

03:15.174 --> 03:19.133
Yeah. I got lucky. I caught some
dribbles off the gravy train.

03:24.116 --> 03:25.947
I thought that was you.

03:26.151 --> 03:29.120
Listen, I got your memo
about the NASA offer.

03:29.321 --> 03:31.380
The opportunity came out of the blue.

03:31.590 --> 03:33.285
A year of training in Houston?

03:33.492 --> 03:35.892
It could be 18 months if they
delay the launch.

03:36.095 --> 03:37.790
- Don't do it.
- What?

03:38.030 --> 03:40.624
Obviously do what you must.
I wish you wouldn't.

03:40.833 --> 03:44.325
- You kept me awake last night.
- I kept you awake?

03:44.536 --> 03:47.903
I do not want to run the Emergency
Department without you.

03:48.374 --> 03:50.433
What'll it take to get you to stay?

03:50.642 --> 03:53.270
Full tenure, effective today.

03:53.479 --> 03:57.472
Well, I probably can't swing that.
But I could push up your eligibility.

03:57.683 --> 03:59.207
Considering you in '02.

03:59.418 --> 04:01.886
- Two thousand two?
- Aught two.

04:02.087 --> 04:04.681
Will somebody tell us
what to call the future?

04:04.890 --> 04:07.791
You'd consider me for tenure
in three years?

04:07.993 --> 04:10.587
We need you. Think about it.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:03.415 --> 05:06.384
- I think you have a flair for this.
- I found my niche:

05:06.585 --> 05:07.609
Pulling drains.

05:07.820 --> 05:10.084
Get the Penrose and not the T-tube.

05:10.289 --> 05:12.416
Pull that, it's not a pretty sight.

05:12.624 --> 05:14.683
Miss IKnight, you found your
way to Dr. Corday.

05:14.893 --> 05:18.488
All the preop labs were
in the charts. I nearly kissed her.

05:18.697 --> 05:21.996
Oh, none of that.
Not unless I get to watch.

05:22.367 --> 05:24.426
I insisted you get a decent student.

05:24.636 --> 05:27.867
- You could use backup with the scut.
- I live for scut.

05:28.774 --> 05:33.507
I'd like you to assist this afternoon
on a choledochojejunostomy.

05:33.712 --> 05:36.647
- Choledochojejunostomy?
- Oh, you can say it.

05:36.849 --> 05:38.180
Would you like to do it?

05:38.717 --> 05:40.275
I'm waiting for the other shoe
to drop.

05:40.486 --> 05:42.044
No catch. You've suffered enough.

05:42.688 --> 05:47.421
I started the groundwork today
to get your fellowship reinstated.

05:47.693 --> 05:49.183
I'll be damned.

05:50.596 --> 05:54.032
Should I feel special, or does he
stare at everyone's breasts?

05:54.233 --> 05:56.201
No. Only the females...

05:56.401 --> 05:58.096
...as far as I know.

05:58.437 --> 06:00.064
It's good for the clinic.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.866
You should know what grants
are applied for.

06:03.075 --> 06:06.374
- Lynette does have some good ideas.
- And you are the boss.

06:06.578 --> 06:07.806
What the hell is that?

06:08.013 --> 06:10.982
- That is our new music program.
- You call that music?

06:11.183 --> 06:14.846
- I told you to start with Erykah Badu.
- It's for patients in Chairs.

06:15.053 --> 06:17.021
Music helps people handle stress.

06:17.222 --> 06:18.917
You're getting ready to DJ a party.

06:19.124 --> 06:22.116
That's just a coincidence.
Somebody signed off on this.

06:22.327 --> 06:23.988
- Who signed off on it?
- Dr. Lee.

06:24.196 --> 06:27.893
Jerry, there is no Dr. Lee.
There never was a Dr. Lee.

06:28.100 --> 06:31.160
- Is that siren in the music?
- It's in the music.

06:31.370 --> 06:33.702
Hey, we could use some extra muscle
out here!

06:33.906 --> 06:37.535
Jerry, turn the music down
and give Conni and me a hand.

06:38.544 --> 06:40.512
Oh, boy! Gird your loins.

06:40.712 --> 06:43.306
36-year-old woman found
at the scene of a fire.

06:43.982 --> 06:46.746
- This is one big woman.
- Probable anaphylaxis.

06:46.952 --> 06:49.921
Her med alert bracelet
said peanut allergy.

06:50.122 --> 06:52.682
- Don't pull until we get a grip.
- Another gurney?

06:52.891 --> 06:55.325
Yeah. A double-wide and a winch.

06:55.527 --> 06:58.052
I hope the wheels don't snap.

06:59.965 --> 07:02.195
Trauma 1, I'll be right there.

07:02.501 --> 07:03.559
Talk to me, Doris.

07:03.769 --> 07:05.737
Second victim is Fred Danziger.

07:05.938 --> 07:08.099
He singed his mustache
putting out the flame.

07:08.307 --> 07:11.743
It's the first call this week
where something was on fire.

07:11.944 --> 07:13.502
She drags me away for nothing.

07:13.712 --> 07:17.239
She could be right. Singed facial
hair could mean a burned airway.

07:17.449 --> 07:21.579
Chuny, let's put Fred on a pulse ox
and get a chest x-ray.

07:21.787 --> 07:24.347
I had to force him.
This new policy sucks.

07:24.556 --> 07:27.150
- Adding paramedics to fire trucks?
- Yeah. And the guys resent it.

07:27.359 --> 07:30.260
They blame me for having to answer
so many medical calls.

07:30.462 --> 07:32.953
Nobody likes change.
You did the right thing.

07:33.165 --> 07:36.157
So you passed out and took a fall?

07:36.368 --> 07:38.393
Angie found me.

07:38.604 --> 07:41.698
- Is Angie your home-health aide?
- She was.

07:42.708 --> 07:44.767
They burn out fast with me.

07:45.177 --> 07:46.769
You see my chart?

07:46.979 --> 07:50.540
Yes, sir. Pancreatic cancer
and mets to the liver.

07:51.049 --> 07:55.782
I keep hoping that "end-stage" means
it can't get any worse.

07:55.988 --> 07:57.785
Nausea pretty bad?

08:00.592 --> 08:02.890
We're gonna hydrate you,
see if that helps.

08:03.095 --> 08:06.428
Would you like me to put your own
robe back on? It can get chilly.

08:06.632 --> 08:10.090
- Did Angie call my son?
- I can find out.

08:14.539 --> 08:15.938
Is that yours?

08:17.909 --> 08:19.399
Ten years ago...

08:19.611 --> 08:22.444
...I kicked my son out of the house
over this stuff.

08:23.282 --> 08:25.113
Now he gets it for me.

08:25.317 --> 08:26.978
Helps with the nausea?

08:29.221 --> 08:30.381
Do you have to take it?

08:30.922 --> 08:32.253
Take what?

08:35.794 --> 08:38.820
- Can you open your eyes?
- Unresponsive since the Valium.

08:39.030 --> 08:43.229
Pulse ox is 99o/o. Can you imagine
lugging around all this fat?

08:43.434 --> 08:45.995
It didn't stop her from
eating noodles at 9 a.m.

08:46.204 --> 08:49.833
Does Radiology stock
extra-extra large?

08:50.042 --> 08:51.339
Better call the vet school.

08:51.543 --> 08:53.704
Okay, everybody, settle down.

08:53.912 --> 08:56.904
Miss Meredith, you've had a bad
allergic reaction.

08:57.115 --> 09:00.551
- The tube is to help you breathe.
- BP's 90/60.

09:00.752 --> 09:03.220
Let's start dopamine
at five mics per kilo.

09:03.422 --> 09:06.016
- How many kilos?
- You want a calculator?

09:06.224 --> 09:09.853
- What do you think, 275 pounds?
- Oh, I'll take the over.

09:10.062 --> 09:12.121
- Hey, were you looking for me?
- Yeah.

09:12.331 --> 09:15.926
Conni, start her at 750 mics.
Let me know how she does.

09:16.134 --> 09:18.762
You're gonna be fine.
We got it under control.

09:19.171 --> 09:21.366
As part of your workload...

09:21.573 --> 09:24.371
...you'll teach patient/doctor
class to second-years.

09:24.576 --> 09:25.736
Patient/doctor class?

09:25.944 --> 09:28.742
Students practice H & Ps
on simulated patients.

09:28.947 --> 09:32.940
I remember. Bad actors pretended
like they were sick. I hated it.

09:33.151 --> 09:34.277
Yeah? Why is that?

09:34.486 --> 09:37.011
Because it's fake.
Everybody knows it's fake.

09:37.222 --> 09:39.156
It's a waste of time.

09:39.358 --> 09:43.590
Yeah. Well, starting tomorrow, you're
gonna learn to hate it all over again.

09:43.795 --> 09:46.025
It'll sharpen your teaching skills.

09:46.231 --> 09:48.131
Did Lucy give me a bad evaluation?

09:48.333 --> 09:50.392
Lucy gave you a fair evaluation.

09:50.602 --> 09:53.036
I'll put the teaching guide
in your box.

09:53.739 --> 09:55.707
The patient collapsed
push-starting a car.

09:55.907 --> 09:58.705
Slurred speech and right-side weakness.
Resolved in 30 minutes.

09:58.910 --> 10:00.571
- Suggesting...?
- A T.I.A.

10:00.779 --> 10:03.748
Dr. Corday ordered doppler
ultrasound in his carotid arteries.

10:03.949 --> 10:07.214
- Which demonstrates what?
- A 50o/o lesion on the left side.

10:07.419 --> 10:09.011
This is a surgical candidate?

10:09.221 --> 10:11.553
- He's pretty old.
- How old?

10:11.757 --> 10:15.056
- He was push-starting a car.
- He claims not to know his age.

10:15.260 --> 10:18.093
Well, wasn't your Civil War
in the 1860s?

10:18.296 --> 10:21.026
According to Mr. Barnes,
he's roughly 140.

10:21.233 --> 10:24.634
- Elizabeth, is now a good time?
- I'm not sure.

10:24.836 --> 10:26.303
Ms. IKnight and I can handle this.

10:26.505 --> 10:28.837
- Peter, 8:00.
- I don't know if I can make it.

10:29.040 --> 10:33.067
We need to compile
our sternal saw data by tomorrow.

10:33.278 --> 10:35.803
Mr. Barnes,
what are you doing out of bed?

10:36.548 --> 10:38.311
I asked you to call me Charley.

10:38.517 --> 10:42.283
You have to stay in your gown
so Dr. Benton can examine you.

10:42.487 --> 10:43.818
Is that you?

10:47.959 --> 10:50.223
I don't mean no disrespect.

10:50.562 --> 10:53.463
But when you get to be my age
and you loll around in bed...

10:53.665 --> 10:56.031
...them rheumatoids kick in.
Pretty soon...

10:56.234 --> 10:57.724
...you can't move at all.

10:57.936 --> 11:00.996
Unfortunately, you have blockage
in your neck artery.

11:01.473 --> 11:03.464
It puts you at risk for a stroke.

11:03.975 --> 11:06.443
I can't have that.
Too many people counting on me.

11:06.645 --> 11:09.773
Charley helps the older people
in his neighborhood.

11:09.981 --> 11:13.382
And the children. They need sitters,
those people working all day.

11:14.019 --> 11:15.247
Are you...

11:16.121 --> 11:17.110
...her teacher?

11:17.689 --> 11:18.656
At the moment.

11:18.857 --> 11:22.258
Then you know, you and I,
we have the responsibility...

11:22.461 --> 11:25.862
...to pass on what life has taught us.

11:27.132 --> 11:29.123
Can you fix me up?

11:29.601 --> 11:32.001
Well, there is a surgical option.

11:32.204 --> 11:34.900
But I hesitate to use it on someone...

11:35.874 --> 11:36.863
...your age.

11:37.075 --> 11:39.669
You ain't ever seen a patient my age.

11:39.878 --> 11:41.277
You don't have to worry.

11:41.480 --> 11:44.381
I can't be killed because I got
a conjure on me.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.115
I don't know what that means.

11:47.319 --> 11:49.412
Of course you don't.

11:49.621 --> 11:52.351
Because you are a man of science.

11:52.557 --> 11:55.890
How else you gonna explain
my being alive at all?

11:56.094 --> 11:59.791
When every other body, all the ones
from slavery times...

11:59.998 --> 12:04.594
...done died 50 and 60 years ago.

12:10.108 --> 12:12.668
Miss IKnight, what would you suggest?

12:14.312 --> 12:16.303
I'd call a Psych consult.

12:18.316 --> 12:20.750
Is that the doc for loonies?

12:23.421 --> 12:25.150
Yes, sir. Yes, it is.

12:26.925 --> 12:29.359
He's outrageous. He can be tasteless.

12:29.561 --> 12:32.257
He certainly likes to throw
his weight around.

12:32.631 --> 12:37.364
So you can't corroborate any
instances of sexual harassment?

12:38.904 --> 12:41.964
It's a very American thing,
if I may say...

12:42.173 --> 12:45.802
...this penchant for turning
personal issues into lawsuits.

12:47.012 --> 12:51.506
The hospital's hope, of course,
is for me as ombudsperson...

12:51.716 --> 12:53.809
...to address problems
and avoid lawsuits.

12:54.019 --> 12:57.716
Look, one has to be thick-skinned
working around Dr. Romano.

12:57.923 --> 13:00.153
You roll with the punches, don't you?

13:00.492 --> 13:04.326
Whoever's complaining may be too
fragile to practice medicine at all.

13:04.896 --> 13:07.228
Her identity is confidential...

13:07.432 --> 13:11.129
...until I can assess
if any action is warranted.

13:11.336 --> 13:16.035
It's a delicate business. Rarely do I
hear the kind of slam dunk...

13:16.241 --> 13:19.005
...where Dr. So-and-So made
sexual advances. She declined.

13:19.210 --> 13:22.907
And then he either fired her
or cut her funds.

13:23.582 --> 13:24.844
Right.

13:29.521 --> 13:31.216
Is Robert aware of this complaint?

13:31.423 --> 13:33.755
He doesn't know who came to me.

13:33.959 --> 13:38.396
He could figure it out since I prevent
the parties from working together.

13:39.464 --> 13:40.692
I see.

13:41.666 --> 13:43.896
It's my fault.
I let it go on too long.

13:44.102 --> 13:46.468
It's not your fault.
We're gonna start a line.

13:46.671 --> 13:48.798
- What's going on?
- Remember Ricky?

13:49.007 --> 13:53.103
He hasn't had a bowel movement in
three days. His temp spiked to 101.

13:53.311 --> 13:56.371
I let him get septic. I've always
been able to disimpact him.

13:56.581 --> 13:57.673
You disimpact him at home?

13:57.882 --> 14:00.112
I usually use a glove and Vaseline.

14:00.318 --> 14:02.752
The morphine's made him constipated.

14:02.988 --> 14:04.080
Why is he on morphine?

14:04.289 --> 14:07.554
He's having pain from contractures.
That's what I think.

14:07.759 --> 14:10.387
Ricky stopped speaking about
a week ago.

14:10.595 --> 14:11.687
I'm sorry.

14:11.896 --> 14:13.454
He still opens his eyes sometimes.

14:14.299 --> 14:18.099
- Is the morphine working for the pain?
- I don't know.

14:18.303 --> 14:21.067
- Oh, God!
- It's all right. I've got it.

14:25.043 --> 14:26.567
I'm sorry.

14:26.945 --> 14:28.378
It's just...

14:31.950 --> 14:33.975
I know. I know.

14:34.853 --> 14:36.946
Everything he's been through...

14:37.155 --> 14:40.215
...I fall apart over this.
- It's okay.

14:40.425 --> 14:43.155
It's okay. I know.

14:51.069 --> 14:53.867
When we got to Michigan Avenue,
he just passed out.

14:54.072 --> 14:56.768
- How long ago did he hit his head?
- Four hours.

14:56.975 --> 15:00.502
He was fixing a floodlight over
our garage. The ladder slipped.

15:00.712 --> 15:03.408
But he seemed okay.
He just had a headache.

15:03.615 --> 15:06.709
When you have a head injury,
it's best to call the paramedics.

15:06.918 --> 15:08.977
- I did call.
- Paramedics didn't show?

15:09.187 --> 15:11.849
No. They came, but Jim seemed okay.

15:12.057 --> 15:15.356
And then there was a fire somewhere
and they got called away.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.085
Jerry's gonna show you
where you can park.

15:18.296 --> 15:20.287
Jerry, I want you to call Dispatch.

15:20.498 --> 15:23.262
Find out which unit responded
to the Haggerty's call.

15:24.269 --> 15:25.497
Ricky's resting.

15:25.704 --> 15:29.231
His fever is due to an ear infection.
They're treating it with antibiotics.

15:29.441 --> 15:32.001
- Thank you, Carol, for everything.
- Oh, sure.

15:32.210 --> 15:34.804
Dr. Ross will be out to talk
to you about it.

15:35.113 --> 15:38.412
You always see me when I'm such
a wreck. I usually cope better.

15:38.616 --> 15:41.779
Well, sometimes coping too much
can drive you crazy.

15:41.986 --> 15:45.217
I meant to thank you.
The respite care has been wonderful.

15:45.423 --> 15:48.119
Oh, good. Did you get to your
daughter's recital?

15:48.326 --> 15:51.784
I had the worker come back another
time just so I could take a bath.

15:51.996 --> 15:54.123
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

15:54.332 --> 15:55.594
We had great news last week.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.633
My daughter's blood test came back.
She's not a carrier.

15:58.837 --> 16:00.828
- Oh, that's a relief.
- Thank God.

16:01.039 --> 16:03.269
She'll never do this to her kids.

16:06.177 --> 16:08.668
We'll keep him until
his fever comes down.

16:09.314 --> 16:11.339
I'll see you before you go, okay?

16:12.083 --> 16:16.520
Does this mean we have to reduce
Ricky's morphine to prevent this?

16:16.721 --> 16:18.382
That's one thing we could do.

16:19.858 --> 16:22.622
This was the hardest part
with Michael.

16:22.827 --> 16:25.762
I lost Ricky's older brother to ALD
three years ago.

16:25.964 --> 16:27.090
Right.

16:27.532 --> 16:30.433
Now he can't tell me it hurts.

16:30.635 --> 16:34.435
Somehow it's worse
to see him suffering.

16:35.039 --> 16:37.769
I'll check. There may be something
we can do for the pain.

16:38.543 --> 16:40.704
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:43.014 --> 16:44.481
I'm in. Hyperventilate him.

16:44.682 --> 16:46.513
BP 160/90. Pulse 60.

16:46.718 --> 16:47.650
Mannitol's in.

16:47.852 --> 16:49.820
Your husband has a blown pupil.

16:50.021 --> 16:53.980
I'm worried the bleeding in the skull
could be putting pressure on his brain.

16:54.225 --> 16:58.127
- CT's ready.
- We'll get a head CT to find out more.

16:58.329 --> 16:59.819
Take Mrs. Haggerty to Chairs.

17:00.031 --> 17:03.091
Chuny, call Neurosurgery down here
right away.

17:05.103 --> 17:08.868
- I was afraid you weren't joining us.
- I'm looking forward to it.

17:09.073 --> 17:12.440
You don't see a choledochojejunostomy
every day.

17:12.644 --> 17:16.011
When they shuffled the schedule,
I was afraid I was gonna miss out.

17:16.214 --> 17:20.150
The Resident let the patient eat,
and we had to postpone.

17:20.351 --> 17:23.548
That's the problem sometimes
with Residents rotating in.

17:23.755 --> 17:25.450
They're not up to it or don't care.

17:25.656 --> 17:29.821
- Who was this Resident?
- Third-year from Emergency.

17:30.028 --> 17:32.496
- Doyle.
- Maggie Doyle?

17:32.864 --> 17:36.630
They think very highly of her. She's
being considered for Chief Resident.

17:36.835 --> 17:38.803
The pickings must be slim this year.

17:39.003 --> 17:41.801
I've always found her to be
extremely capable.

17:42.974 --> 17:45.135
I hear she makes a lot
of women uncomfortable.

17:47.712 --> 17:49.145
This is gonna be nifty.

17:49.347 --> 17:53.044
Stones in the common bile duct
distal to the sphincter of Oddi.

17:53.251 --> 17:54.650
No kidding?

17:55.153 --> 17:57.053
My whole team is tied up in the O.R.

17:57.255 --> 17:59.689
Someone needs
to scrub out and join us.

17:59.891 --> 18:02.587
- That's why you have to wait.
- Look at the size of the clot.

18:02.794 --> 18:05.695
It's compressing his brain.
Every second counts.

18:08.099 --> 18:10.863
Chuny, shave the scalp.
Malik, open the burr hole tray.

18:11.069 --> 18:12.866
You can't do burr holes in the ER.

18:13.071 --> 18:15.039
You're not giving me any choice.

18:15.240 --> 18:16.969
What size gloves do you take?

18:17.175 --> 18:18.733
I am not comfortable with this.

18:18.943 --> 18:21.173
We can't wait without
risking brain damage.

18:21.379 --> 18:23.210
I'll try again to get someone down.

18:23.414 --> 18:26.042
- Twelve blade.
- Pulse is down to 55.

18:26.251 --> 18:28.446
- Self-retaining retractor.
- This is a mistake.

18:28.653 --> 18:30.587
Pressure's up to 180/95.

18:30.788 --> 18:32.255
That's the Cushing response.

18:32.457 --> 18:35.017
It'll herniate unless
we relieve the pressure.

18:35.226 --> 18:37.126
Periosteal elevator.

18:37.328 --> 18:40.024
- My Chief can be down in 20 minutes.
- Too long.

18:40.231 --> 18:42.722
Hudson brace and perforator.

18:46.704 --> 18:49.002
I can see the skull fracture line.

18:49.207 --> 18:54.577
ABG is back: PH 7.51, PCO-2's 25,
PO-2's 350.

18:54.779 --> 18:56.076
That's what we want.

18:58.483 --> 19:00.610
Okay, I'm ready for the burr hole.

19:00.818 --> 19:03.082
Can't you wait a few minutes?

19:05.456 --> 19:08.289
IKeep the irrigation coming.
I need to see what I'm doing.

19:09.527 --> 19:10.494
Please...

19:10.695 --> 19:11.855
...not too deep.

19:17.402 --> 19:18.835
That's okay.

19:20.104 --> 19:21.799
I'm through the inner table.

19:22.006 --> 19:23.997
Okay, there's the clot.

19:25.343 --> 19:26.901
I need a dural suction catheter.

19:27.111 --> 19:29.944
Pulse up to 170.
BP's 140/70.

19:30.148 --> 19:32.309
- Pupils are equal.
- That's more like it.

19:32.517 --> 19:34.917
Wet sterile gauze.
Let's get him to the O.R.

19:35.119 --> 19:36.643
I'll alert the team.

19:37.055 --> 19:38.818
Tell them to take their time.

19:42.093 --> 19:43.526
Hey, Dr. Greene.

19:44.462 --> 19:45.656
Nice job.

19:47.999 --> 19:50.365
You got time for a quick question?

19:50.568 --> 19:51.432
Yeah, sure.

19:51.636 --> 19:54.070
Can I account for a broken
container in the study?

19:54.272 --> 19:55.864
One of the vials busted?

19:56.074 --> 19:57.974
The powder spilled into the envelope.

19:58.176 --> 20:00.576
I'd just make a note of it.

20:00.778 --> 20:05.147
We don't have many patients enlisted.
We won't use all the samples.

20:05.350 --> 20:07.978
That's all I wanted to know.
You gonna make your lecture?

20:08.186 --> 20:10.051
The guy from NASA at the med school?

20:10.254 --> 20:12.119
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

20:12.557 --> 20:16.015
Mrs. Haggerty, your husband's been
stabilized and sent up to the O.R.

20:16.227 --> 20:18.422
- What?
- Jerry.

20:19.497 --> 20:23.331
Your husband has been sent up to
Surgery. Someone will take you up.

20:23.534 --> 20:24.899
I'll take her up.

20:25.103 --> 20:28.197
Dr. Greene stabilized your husband.
He's doing fine.

20:29.040 --> 20:32.168
Did you find out which paramedic
unit left him with a brain bleed?

20:32.377 --> 20:37.076
It was an engine company that went out.
Doris Pickman was the paramedic.

20:37.281 --> 20:38.305
Oh, boy.

20:38.516 --> 20:40.450
The deputy chief will handle it.

20:40.651 --> 20:45.020
Listen, call Dispatch back and tell
them that I'm gonna follow up.

20:45.223 --> 20:49.023
Oh, and Jerry, if you put
that music back on, you're fired.

20:50.595 --> 20:52.324
I'm sorry it's taking so long.

20:52.530 --> 20:55.021
We put my fingertip on ice.
It'll be okay, right?

20:55.233 --> 20:59.670
It's a possibility we won't be able
to reattach. The surgeon will decide.

21:01.272 --> 21:03.035
You're still waiting on Plastics?

21:03.241 --> 21:05.641
They swore he's on his way.

21:06.444 --> 21:09.345
Did you find another candidate
for that fracture study?

21:11.382 --> 21:13.748
No. Just recording a broken container.

21:14.252 --> 21:17.380
- Is he a plastic surgeon?
- No. Sorry.

21:18.056 --> 21:19.523
You want something to drink?

21:19.724 --> 21:22.352
My dad's getting me a Coke.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.619
It shouldn't be that much longer.

21:28.132 --> 21:29.861
Did you find my son?

21:30.068 --> 21:32.832
His office said he was out
on a sales call.

21:33.037 --> 21:36.029
He's not picking up his cell phone.
We'll keep trying.

21:36.240 --> 21:37.639
Thank you.

21:38.443 --> 21:42.174
- Is the Zofran helping the nausea?
- No.

21:42.380 --> 21:44.780
I'm gonna ask the docs to add Reglan.

21:44.982 --> 21:48.179
Don't bother. They don't work.

21:51.989 --> 21:56.449
Any chance you could wheel me outside
for some fresh air?

22:00.431 --> 22:05.391
I can't take you to smoke marijuana.
Maybe your son can help you.

22:05.603 --> 22:06.729
I'm really sorry.

22:07.538 --> 22:08.596
Don't be.

22:10.341 --> 22:14.072
I'm probably not able
to inhale anyway.

22:19.283 --> 22:22.275
The neuromuscular response
can be studied since...

22:22.487 --> 22:26.617
...there's no gravitational force
in the usual Z axis from head to toe.

22:26.824 --> 22:28.257
Gentleman in the back.

22:28.459 --> 22:30.950
What are the applications
of this study?

22:31.162 --> 22:33.960
A loss of muscle tone in microgravity
is an issue...

22:34.165 --> 22:36.326
...sci-fi movies
have largely ignored.

22:36.534 --> 22:38.798
Cosmonauts who spent months on <i>Mir...</i>

22:39.003 --> 22:41.437
...had to be carried
from the spacecraft.

22:42.140 --> 22:45.166
I'd like to kick off the Q and A
with a question to you:

22:45.376 --> 22:47.776
What interested you
in the astronaut program?

22:47.979 --> 22:51.073
I ask because a lot of candidates
admit to childhood dreams...

22:51.282 --> 22:53.682
...of adventure...

22:54.018 --> 22:57.476
...the adrenaline of takeoff,
the vastness of space.

22:57.688 --> 23:00.816
The doctor who just walked in,
would you respond?

23:01.025 --> 23:06.122
Well, for me, it was
pretty much adventure.

23:06.330 --> 23:09.094
The adrenaline of takeoff,
the vastness of outer space.

23:10.301 --> 23:12.360
Thank you for your candor, Dr...?

23:12.670 --> 23:15.503
- Mark Greene.
- Dr. Greene.

23:15.706 --> 23:17.401
Doug Lowrey wanted me to look you up.

23:17.608 --> 23:20.509
Dr. Greene may be joining us
as a payload specialist.

23:20.711 --> 23:23.407
The real picture of your schedule,
should you make it...

23:23.614 --> 23:25.479
...is one of routine.

23:25.683 --> 23:28.208
In training, you'll spend
a year repeating tasks...

23:28.419 --> 23:31.513
...following checklists,
adapting to a regimen.

23:31.722 --> 23:34.247
Everything you do is dictated
by the ground crew.

23:34.458 --> 23:37.723
You follow a precise
minute-to-minute itinerary.

23:38.996 --> 23:41.556
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I didn't know what to do.

23:41.766 --> 23:44.496
I screwed up bad. But the guy
seemed fine at the scene.

23:44.702 --> 23:48.001
The engine got the fire call, the guys
were all so jazzed, I told the wife...

23:48.206 --> 23:49.730
Doris, slow down.

23:50.374 --> 23:54.310
- How's Mr. Haggerty?
- Epidural hematoma, but he's okay.

23:54.979 --> 23:58.210
They pulled me off active duty.
They're doing an investigation.

23:58.416 --> 24:02.546
He's worried about bad press.
Fire engine leaves an accident scene.

24:02.753 --> 24:04.721
That's a medical error.
That's my call.

24:04.922 --> 24:08.585
Maybe I was influenced by the
firefighters. They wanted to go.

24:08.793 --> 24:11.785
That shouldn't cloud my judgment.
It'll ruin my record.

24:11.996 --> 24:14.430
Take a breath.
I'll see what I can do.

24:14.632 --> 24:17.100
- Will you?
- I'll call the deputy chief now.

24:17.768 --> 24:20.066
- Come on, doc.
- I'm not gonna do that.

24:20.271 --> 24:22.239
You heard me. Roll up your sleeves.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.931
I'm not gonna arm-wrestle
over surgery.

24:25.142 --> 24:26.074
Are you scared to?

24:26.277 --> 24:27.710
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I am.

24:27.912 --> 24:31.575
Well, I want the surgery.
That's all there is to it.

24:31.782 --> 24:36.116
And that one doctor calculated
that I was fit in the head.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.517
Because you didn't mention
you thought you were at Appomattox.

24:39.824 --> 24:42.418
But there was another doctor
who also said...

24:42.627 --> 24:47.064
...my FEV-1 was over 120 percent.

24:47.265 --> 24:48.857
I think that's darn good.

24:49.066 --> 24:50.761
They cleared you physically.

24:50.968 --> 24:53.436
You're giving me that
second-rate pill idea.

24:54.338 --> 24:58.604
You think the medical treatment
isn't convincing. I use my judgment.

24:58.809 --> 25:02.711
Your judgment is to put your arm
next to mine, clasping my hand...

25:03.281 --> 25:05.215
...and we will arm-wrestle.

25:05.416 --> 25:09.716
You will find out that old Charley's
not as weak and puny as you think.

25:09.920 --> 25:10.978
I never said...

25:11.322 --> 25:12.414
I don't think you're puny.

25:12.623 --> 25:14.454
But you don't believe I can't die.

25:15.059 --> 25:16.617
I don't believe that one either.

25:16.994 --> 25:19.189
I'll give you something
you can believe.

25:19.397 --> 25:20.955
Put your elbow right here.

25:21.165 --> 25:22.257
Mr. Barnes, come on.

25:22.466 --> 25:26.095
Listen, if you don't give a man
his measure of respect...

25:26.304 --> 25:27.896
...and you don't believe his history...

25:28.105 --> 25:29.800
...you're talking about a fight.

25:31.309 --> 25:34.301
Oh, come on.
Don't make your elder beg.

25:34.512 --> 25:36.002
Come on.

25:47.358 --> 25:48.484
Go.

25:50.127 --> 25:51.560
Dr. Benton?

25:52.163 --> 25:53.790
There is an O.R. Available.

25:57.468 --> 25:59.197
Hey, don't humor me now.

26:02.106 --> 26:03.801
Oh, boy.

26:07.712 --> 26:09.077
You win.

26:10.881 --> 26:13.315
You win. All right, go ahead.

26:13.517 --> 26:15.007
Book the O.R.

26:19.557 --> 26:22.788
It's a new policy putting
paramedics on fire trucks.

26:22.993 --> 26:26.224
It'll take a while to work
the kinks out. I know Doris.

26:26.430 --> 26:30.958
I work with her. She deserves
to be counseled, not put on a desk.

26:31.168 --> 26:33.568
No, no, no. This is my job.

26:33.938 --> 26:36.805
- Is Doug Ross around?
- Try Admit.

26:37.208 --> 26:40.143
Deputy Chief Mead, please?
Mark Greene again.

26:43.214 --> 26:45.148
They let you out of the lab?

26:45.349 --> 26:47.613
I make deliveries for some customers.

26:47.818 --> 26:50.878
I got the toxicology results
on that powder you brought us.

26:51.088 --> 26:53.215
Negative for codeine.

26:53.424 --> 26:56.120
- Is that all you needed?
- That'll do it.

26:56.327 --> 26:58.989
When I heard you hand-carried it,
I thought...

26:59.230 --> 27:02.063
...well, maybe you were back
on the market.

27:02.266 --> 27:03.733
Me? No. I...

27:03.934 --> 27:07.870
I called the HandiVan for the Abbotts.
Joi said you wanted a prescription.

27:08.072 --> 27:09.835
- I'm on my way.
- Nice to see you.

27:10.040 --> 27:13.601
- See you later.
- Ricky's temp is 98.8.

27:13.811 --> 27:17.269
- Which is good.
- You know back there that was nothing?

27:17.481 --> 27:19.039
Yeah, of course.

27:19.250 --> 27:22.378
I'm afraid Lynette has
appropriated the lounge.

27:22.586 --> 27:25.578
The staff will have
to gossip someplace else.

27:25.790 --> 27:26.984
You knew about it?

27:27.191 --> 27:31.890
She showed me her proposal last week.
It's a good area for the clinic.

27:33.697 --> 27:35.927
I know you can tell if he's cheating.
But some...

27:36.133 --> 27:38.294
Your man don't take a shower
before he leaves...

27:38.502 --> 27:40.265
...but he does when he gets home?

27:40.471 --> 27:42.405
He's cheating!

27:42.606 --> 27:44.938
The number of partners you have...

27:45.142 --> 27:48.043
...and he has can put you
at risk for cervical cancer.

27:48.245 --> 27:50.645
It can put you at risk
for being a fool.

27:51.282 --> 27:55.742
How young you were when you started
having sex and smoking are factors.

27:57.154 --> 28:01.056
That's right. This is Carol Hathaway.
She runs the clinic here.

28:01.258 --> 28:02.623
Nice to meet you all.

28:03.928 --> 28:08.228
Oh, carry on. I think it's a really
important topic to be informed about.

28:08.432 --> 28:11.060
Please feel free to come
see us at the clinic anytime.

28:11.402 --> 28:12.699
Thanks, Carol.

28:14.271 --> 28:16.296
My apologies. I'm Dr. Baker.

28:17.107 --> 28:19.041
Jeanie Boulet. This is Donna.

28:19.243 --> 28:22.974
- Her father should be back soon.
- This is the x-ray, Ms. Boulet?

28:23.881 --> 28:26.645
I did a digital nerve block
with Marcaine.

28:27.117 --> 28:31.679
Amputated the distal phalanx.
We'll rongeur and do a V-Y flap.

28:31.889 --> 28:33.754
You can put it back on, right?

28:33.958 --> 28:37.655
The blood vessels are too small.
Did you explain to her?

28:37.862 --> 28:40.092
I told her it may be a possibility.

28:43.367 --> 28:46.234
But you guys put arms
and stuff back on.

28:47.137 --> 28:50.834
If you had cut your finger at
the base, we'd have bigger arteries.

28:51.342 --> 28:54.436
We'll trim down the bone
and create a flap over the defect.

28:56.380 --> 28:57.813
You mean I'll have a stump?

28:58.015 --> 29:00.108
Maybe we should talk
to Donna's father.

29:00.317 --> 29:03.809
Yes. If we can get a Trauma Room,
I'll do the procedure right away.

29:06.524 --> 29:09.618
Don't worry. We'll make you
a small prosthetic tip.

29:11.562 --> 29:13.462
I'm saying oldies are played out.

29:13.664 --> 29:16.565
- People like the classics.
- Not ones you can't dance to.

29:16.767 --> 29:17.995
You're gonna lose them.

29:18.202 --> 29:19.430
Jerry, what is this?

29:19.637 --> 29:21.298
You wanted the rap turned off.

29:21.505 --> 29:24.668
Actually, I said we need a desk
clerk here, not a DJ.

29:24.875 --> 29:27.275
Fine. It's no more. Forever gone.

29:27.478 --> 29:30.504
What possessed you to pick
that particular song?

29:30.714 --> 29:34.377
I don't know. Just instinct.
I'm just going with the flow.

29:34.585 --> 29:37.452
My mom used to play this album
when I was a kid.

29:37.655 --> 29:41.091
It was always, like,
the ultimate freedom. You know?

29:41.292 --> 29:43.658
Leave ground control behind
and float way.

29:43.861 --> 29:45.488
- Escape.
- Yeah.

29:46.430 --> 29:50.457
The folks in the Waiting Area want to
know if you could put Bowie back on?

29:50.834 --> 29:54.326
Jerry, do whatever you want, okay?
Just use your best judgment.

29:54.538 --> 29:58.235
All right. Now, you give this to him
every six hours if needed.

29:58.442 --> 30:01.070
You don't exceed four doses
in 24 hours.

30:01.278 --> 30:03.371
Call me if it isn't working for him.

30:03.581 --> 30:04.843
Watch your head.

30:05.783 --> 30:08.547
Why didn't the genetics clinic
suggest this medication?

30:08.752 --> 30:12.950
It's still part of a clinical trial
with kids with fractures.

30:13.157 --> 30:15.853
Perfectly safe for Ricky.
It might give him some relief.

30:16.060 --> 30:19.393
- Do I need to fill any of this out?
- I wouldn't bother.

30:19.597 --> 30:21.997
He's not a candidate for the study.

30:22.199 --> 30:23.791
Thank you.

30:30.641 --> 30:32.541
Trauma 2 is open.
Can you assist me?

30:32.743 --> 30:35.576
I insist. You blew by that
12-year-old girl...

30:35.779 --> 30:38.043
...like she was an annoyance
in your busy day.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.617
You said there's a parent here
to give consent.

30:42.820 --> 30:44.913
Find him. I'll explain the procedure.

30:45.122 --> 30:46.555
I'll do that.

30:48.959 --> 30:51.587
I can't believe I get to scrub in
on my first day.

30:51.795 --> 30:53.888
- That's the best way to learn.
- Masks?

30:54.098 --> 30:55.895
Charley has a crowd in
the Waiting Room.

30:56.100 --> 30:57.465
Does anyone know where he's from?

30:57.668 --> 30:59.602
Been in the neighborhood for years.

30:59.803 --> 31:04.433
That car he was push-starting?
Registration expired in 1956.

31:04.642 --> 31:05.700
He had terrible stories.

31:05.909 --> 31:08.173
The first two branches
of the internal carotid?

31:08.379 --> 31:11.405
The ophthalmic artery
and the posterior communicating.

31:11.615 --> 31:14.812
Okay, that's it. You're ready.
Let's go.

31:22.259 --> 31:25.387
Gown and glove Miss IKnight.
She doesn't know the ropes.

31:25.596 --> 31:26.927
Just about to put him under.

31:27.131 --> 31:31.158
IKeep your hands in front of you. Don't
reach for anything unless you're told.

31:31.368 --> 31:34.030
- What if I have an itch?
- Tell the nurse where.

31:34.238 --> 31:35.364
What is that?

31:35.572 --> 31:37.233
- Dr. Riggs?
- He's bradying down.

31:37.441 --> 31:39.807
- Atropine.
- One milligram onboard.

31:40.010 --> 31:42.308
- Blood pressure's dropping.
- He's in V-fib.

31:42.513 --> 31:44.310
- Grab the crash cart.
- I'm sterile!

31:44.515 --> 31:46.142
It doesn't make a difference.

31:46.350 --> 31:49.148
Amp of epi. Let's move.
Come on. Clear!

31:50.320 --> 31:52.254
- Asystole.
- Start compressions.

31:52.456 --> 31:55.289
- Epi and atropine onboard.
- Right. What's the rhythm?

31:55.492 --> 31:58.052
- Got an idioventricular rhythm.
- Faint pulse.

31:58.262 --> 32:00.423
- Try to get a BP.
- Can he still have surgery?

32:00.631 --> 32:03.464
No. Let's get him a room in the ICU.

32:12.042 --> 32:13.509
How long till spring?

32:13.711 --> 32:18.444
- This is the shortest day of the year.
- That's December. We're past that.

32:19.183 --> 32:22.311
I made up my mind.
I'm not going to Houston.

32:23.220 --> 32:26.121
- Really?
- It's an old dream.

32:26.924 --> 32:29.984
You fooled me.
I thought you were ready to blast off.

32:30.194 --> 32:33.129
I realized I didn't want to go.

32:34.131 --> 32:36.099
I don't want to go anywhere.

32:36.934 --> 32:39.869
This is what I do.
This is where I belong.

32:41.872 --> 32:44.238
Lost that old restlessness?

32:44.441 --> 32:45.669
I guess.

32:51.782 --> 32:52.840
Coming in?

32:56.153 --> 32:58.451
Come on in! It's cold!

32:59.123 --> 33:00.988
You went out of your way
not to involve me.

33:01.191 --> 33:03.250
- Why would I?
- You knew I would object.

33:03.460 --> 33:07.794
- Object to what?
- All the women were African-American.

33:07.998 --> 33:10.489
- Yeah.
- The clinic's for everyone.

33:10.701 --> 33:13.226
- I didn't exclude anyone.
- Where did you advertise?

33:13.437 --> 33:16.372
I have a special interest
in an underserved population...

33:16.573 --> 33:18.734
...that is particularly at risk.

33:18.942 --> 33:22.241
- Latinos are even more at risk.
- Our death rate is higher.

33:22.446 --> 33:24.676
Vietnamese women
have worse statistics.

33:24.882 --> 33:29.581
To get women to consider changing
sexual habits, they need to feel open.

33:29.787 --> 33:32.187
Women talk more freely
among their own.

33:32.389 --> 33:35.552
We'll have to hold seminars
that target other populations.

33:36.460 --> 33:39.759
Look, I did this on my own time
out of my own interests.

33:39.963 --> 33:43.364
I understand that. But I can't
have you pulling against me.

33:43.867 --> 33:48.395
If you want to work in the clinic,
adjust your project to include others.

33:49.873 --> 33:53.775
Well, I guess you've given me
something to think about.

33:56.113 --> 34:00.743
Couple more stitches
and the Y is closed. See?

34:02.452 --> 34:04.579
What kind of music do you play, Donna?

34:06.490 --> 34:08.549
Folk and classical.

34:08.759 --> 34:10.158
Some rock.

34:10.360 --> 34:13.693
Well, Ms. Boulet is right.
More 5-0 nylon, please.

34:14.697 --> 34:16.996
A prosthetic will take
some getting used to.

34:17.201 --> 34:19.829
But with time, you'll be able
to play just fine.

34:20.036 --> 34:24.030
- What about computer games?
- You'll never be able to touch them.

34:24.908 --> 34:26.670
Your dad paid me to say that.

34:28.911 --> 34:31.107
- Cut, please, Jenny.
- It's Jeanie.

34:32.282 --> 34:34.147
Sorry, Ms. Boulet.

34:36.887 --> 34:40.755
- Honest. I owe you my first born.
- You do that and you're on a desk.

34:40.958 --> 34:44.393
- You saved my career.
- I gave you a chance to turn it around.

34:44.594 --> 34:47.655
We'll work out a counseling
schedule next week, okay?

34:47.864 --> 34:49.331
- Thanks.
- Where's Jerry?

34:49.533 --> 34:52.627
- We're in between sets.
- I was taking requests.

34:52.835 --> 34:54.268
- Hey, you off?
- Yeah. Why?

34:54.471 --> 34:56.905
That guy in Exam 2
wanted to say goodbye.

34:57.107 --> 34:58.904
Mr. Ackerman? Pancreatic cancer?

34:59.109 --> 35:02.135
He's gonna have to stay the night.
Nobody can come until tomorrow.

35:02.346 --> 35:04.678
Are you waiting for the health bus?

35:04.882 --> 35:08.477
We're all loaded up. I just had
another question for Dr. Ross.

35:08.685 --> 35:12.781
- Dr. Ross is in a meeting.
- Is there something I can do?

35:12.990 --> 35:16.551
He gave some new medication to us.

35:16.760 --> 35:20.491
I forgot to ask if it's all right
to take with Robaxin. My son has ALD.

35:20.964 --> 35:22.022
He has a fracture?

35:22.232 --> 35:25.360
No. But he was in pain.
Dr. Ross thought this might help.

35:26.036 --> 35:27.469
Where's your study envelope?

35:27.905 --> 35:30.100
He said we didn't need to bother.

35:30.340 --> 35:31.500
Dr. Ross did?

35:32.342 --> 35:35.038
Since my son isn't actually
a candidate for the trial.

35:36.780 --> 35:38.042
I see.

35:42.753 --> 35:44.880
I heard your son couldn't make it.

36:03.473 --> 36:05.100
You need this?

36:05.309 --> 36:06.606
Please.

36:40.243 --> 36:41.733
Never mind.

36:42.179 --> 36:43.942
Oh, God!

37:01.465 --> 37:02.523
Again?

37:37.367 --> 37:40.461
- Hey, is Doug still upstairs?
- I don't know.

37:40.670 --> 37:42.160
Well, I'm headed home.

37:42.839 --> 37:44.966
Mark, what are you doing?

37:45.876 --> 37:48.401
Do you know anything about
a boy with ALD?

37:48.612 --> 37:49.442
Ricky Abbott?

37:49.646 --> 37:51.910
Why was he given meds
for the clinical trial?

37:52.349 --> 37:54.283
He wasn't. Doug wouldn't do that.

37:54.885 --> 37:56.512
Looks like he did.

37:59.022 --> 38:01.855
Talk to Doug. I'm sure there's
an explanation.

38:10.333 --> 38:13.825
Ms. Boulet, I wanted to thank you
for assisting on the finger flap.

38:14.037 --> 38:15.061
Not at all.

38:15.272 --> 38:18.901
And for reminding me to take time
with our young patient.

38:19.109 --> 38:23.205
I don't do well when I get behind
schedule. But that's no excuse.

38:23.413 --> 38:26.143
- You were right, and I thank you.
- You're welcome.

38:26.349 --> 38:30.877
Would you join me for an opening
at the Art Institute this evening?

38:31.088 --> 38:32.112
This evening?

38:32.322 --> 38:35.382
I realize it's short notice.
It may be interesting:

38:35.592 --> 38:37.583
Raghubir Singh, an Indian
photographer.

38:37.794 --> 38:39.227
I don't know much about art.

38:39.429 --> 38:43.991
I don't care about art. I promised
my wife, who died a few years ago...

38:44.201 --> 38:48.103
...I'd keep our membership and not
become a Philistine without her.

38:48.305 --> 38:50.273
I'm sorry to hear you lost your wife.

38:50.474 --> 38:54.240
And my partner. Jenny and I had
a practice together for 15 years.

38:54.444 --> 38:56.036
Her name was Jenny?

38:56.246 --> 38:57.770
You're a sweet angel.

38:57.981 --> 38:59.346
Called for a consult?

38:59.549 --> 39:02.245
- Self-inflicted knife wounds.
- Quite a few of them.

39:02.452 --> 39:04.750
He gave me a suturing refresher.

39:04.955 --> 39:06.047
She's my angel.

39:06.256 --> 39:09.248
That is not what he was calling me
before the Haldol.

39:09.459 --> 39:12.986
No blood in the urine but these two
needed two-layer closures.

39:13.196 --> 39:15.858
Good bowel sounds. Belly's soft.

39:16.066 --> 39:20.799
I wanted to mention to you I have
been having a problem with Dr. Romano.

39:22.372 --> 39:26.274
IKerry spoke with me this morning
without actually saying it was you.

39:26.476 --> 39:29.001
I'm sorry I didn't ask before
dragging your name in.

39:30.013 --> 39:32.311
I don't think I can be of any help.

39:35.952 --> 39:38.648
Well, no sign of any
intra-abdominal bleed.

39:38.855 --> 39:41.790
He's got another one on his back.
We'll have to lift him.

39:41.992 --> 39:45.086
I hoped Romano would cool it
if I confronted him.

39:45.295 --> 39:48.662
But instead he threatened to blast me
on my evaluation.

39:50.066 --> 39:52.500
Dr. Romano can be volatile.

39:52.702 --> 39:55.466
You mean he's a mean-spirited
little powermonger?

39:55.672 --> 39:58.971
That too.
Well, the kidneys look fine as well.

39:59.910 --> 40:02.003
Whores! Whores! I want to die.

40:02.212 --> 40:04.237
There's the Mr. Michaels I know
and love.

40:06.583 --> 40:10.917
Look, Romano, he likes to push
things to the limit.

40:11.922 --> 40:14.686
I guess he thought anything goes
with the gay chick.

40:15.025 --> 40:17.585
I hope you're not going out
on a limb.

40:19.596 --> 40:21.029
He's a star.

40:21.631 --> 40:23.394
Self-respect's a bitch.

40:26.369 --> 40:31.068
- IKerry, do you have a moment?
- Mark needs me. You're leaving?

40:31.274 --> 40:34.038
- How about breakfast tomorrow?
- That's more than a minute.

40:34.244 --> 40:36.804
I may have some things to add
to your inquiry.

40:37.013 --> 40:39.413
I'll call you.
We'll set something up.

40:39.616 --> 40:41.777
There she is. Minnesota Fats.

40:41.985 --> 40:44.453
- I was afraid I'd missed you.
- Hey, Reggie.

40:44.654 --> 40:46.645
You'll give me a chance
to win my money back?

40:46.856 --> 40:49.416
Playing pool two nights in a row
is bad luck.

40:49.626 --> 40:52.823
It's bad luck to play against you.
Where'd you learn?

40:53.029 --> 40:54.997
Signs of a misspent youth.

40:55.532 --> 40:57.227
What do you say we go eat?

40:57.434 --> 40:59.527
I already have plans for tonight.

40:59.736 --> 41:01.533
Something a new friend
can barge in on?

41:01.738 --> 41:03.831
Opening at the Art Institute.

41:04.040 --> 41:06.634
Say no more.
I'll catch you on the weekend.

41:09.879 --> 41:13.838
I almost went straight to Anspaugh.
What the hell was Doug thinking?

41:14.050 --> 41:19.181
If we were exposed for breaking
protocol on a federally funded trial...

41:19.389 --> 41:22.586
They'd cut off research money
and Medicare payments for years.

41:22.792 --> 41:24.623
And it's against the law.

41:26.129 --> 41:28.154
They brought me the study.

41:28.732 --> 41:30.165
I got him onboard.

41:31.835 --> 41:33.530
Mark, given the implications...

41:33.737 --> 41:37.138
...I don't think we have any choice
but to handle this internally.

41:37.574 --> 41:38.871
Cover it up.

41:40.744 --> 41:43.770
If Anspaugh finds out,
he has to react.

41:46.416 --> 41:48.384
Nice position he put us in, huh?

41:48.952 --> 41:51.079
Do you have the key
to the pain study cabinet?

41:52.055 --> 41:53.818
Come in and take a seat.

42:00.497 --> 42:01.725
Any changes?

42:03.166 --> 42:04.565
Will he wake up?

42:05.402 --> 42:06.869
What do you think?

42:08.238 --> 42:13.403
His brain was deprived of a lot
of oxygen during the cardiac arrest.

42:13.610 --> 42:17.706
Old folks don't usually come back with
full function after hypoxic insult.

42:18.415 --> 42:19.905
It's a wait-and-see.

42:21.651 --> 42:23.778
He could live like this for a while.

42:24.187 --> 42:27.452
Forever. Well, according to him.

42:33.029 --> 42:34.724
What's his Glasgow score?

42:35.432 --> 42:36.694
An eight.

42:37.400 --> 42:39.425
No spontaneous eye-opening.

42:39.636 --> 42:41.160
No speaking.

42:41.938 --> 42:44.498
Responds only to painful stimulus.

42:44.941 --> 42:46.135
Excuse me.

42:56.820 --> 42:58.947
I'm sorry. I didn't expect this.

42:59.155 --> 43:01.214
Well, neither did I.

43:03.093 --> 43:04.993
Should I go tell his neighbors?

43:05.695 --> 43:07.959
No. I'll do it.

43:11.401 --> 43:13.164
<i>Then to top it off, he goes...</i>

43:13.370 --> 43:16.100
...to IKerry Weaver instead
of coming to me.

43:16.906 --> 43:18.134
But you gave Joi the meds?

43:18.341 --> 43:21.310
Mark said that he wasn't
gonna use all the samples.

43:21.511 --> 43:24.309
- That's not the point, is it?
- What is the point?

43:24.514 --> 43:28.245
That breaking research protocol could
damage the hospital's funding.

43:32.389 --> 43:34.254
So you agree with them?

43:35.258 --> 43:36.691
I see their point.

43:37.660 --> 43:38.957
You know how sick he is?

43:39.662 --> 43:43.598
Yeah, but that decision could have
a larger impact.

43:45.335 --> 43:49.101
The hospital's only at risk if someone
goes out of their way to report me.

43:49.305 --> 43:52.638
And believe me, it kills IKerry Weaver
not to be able to do that.

43:58.381 --> 43:59.780
I don't know what to say.

44:09.025 --> 44:10.890
Doug, don't walk away.
