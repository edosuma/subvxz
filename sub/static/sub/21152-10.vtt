It looks like every major

I was there for Kiko Kagami.
I work at "GMA" now.

08:40.733 --> 08:42.767
- Mm, Kelsey runs
her own imprint now.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.533
It's called "Millennial."

08:44.600 --> 08:45.967
- You're publishing
"Marriage Vacation."

08:46.067 --> 08:47.333
- Yeah.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.733
- That book is getting
a lot of buzz.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.333
Can I see a galley?
- Soon.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.900
- We should get dinner

08:51.967 --> 08:53.267
and talk about
getting the book on the show.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.800
I think it'd be
a great fit for us.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.567
- Oh, my God, yes,
I would love that.

08:56.633 --> 08:58.567
Here you go.
- Cool, I'll keep in touch.

08:58.633 --> 08:59.900
- Great.

09:00.067 --> 09:01.833
- Well, you networked.

09:01.900 --> 09:03.667
Happy now?
- Yes.

09:03.733 --> 09:05.367
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:05.433 --> 09:07.300
You know, I'm gonna go
with bloodstain on the boat.

I went to Wharton, you know.

09:20.767 --> 09:23.367
- Oh.
- But then I met Teddy,

09:23.433 --> 09:25.600
and we got married,
and I got pregnant--

09:25.667 --> 09:27.067
well, I don't have to tell you.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.967
- Nope, I get it.

09:29.067 --> 09:30.800
- Apparently you wrote
the book on it,

09:30.867 --> 09:33.833
which I can't wait
to get my hands on.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.967
Anyone in there
I might recognize?

09:36.067 --> 09:37.933

to buy it and see.

Teddy and I are having
some people over

09:43.433 --> 09:44.867

tomorrow night.

09:44.933 --> 09:46.400
Why don't we make it
a book party?

09:46.467 --> 09:49.167
- Oh, the book's not
gonna be out for months.

09:49.233 --> 09:52.400

some buzz for both of us.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.867

- Wonderful.

to come to that thing with me.

- Oh, I will stick out
like a sore thumb

10:06.167 --> 10:07.867
in that crowd. I can't.
- No, no, no, no, no.

10:07.933 --> 10:09.233
I don't fit in either.
Please.

God, I am so glad that Charles
didn't take you off the book.

- What do you mean?
- Oh, no, it was nothing.

10:25.367 --> 10:27.167
He just mentioned it to me.

10:27.233 --> 10:28.667
I'm sure it's because
we're getting along too well

10:28.733 --> 10:30.200
and he feels outnumbered.

10:30.267 --> 10:31.967

that I can't get myself.

to a party with Pauline.

seem to be getting along.

- Yeah?

stuck in lives

we wanted to change,
and now we're changing them.

11:01.167 --> 11:02.300

but the difference is that

hers was Upper East Side wealth.

Yours was Central Jersey

- Hi, Liza.

11:27.567 --> 11:29.100

11:29.167 --> 11:31.100
- I actually thought
about a career in writing,

11:31.167 --> 11:33.767
but that's not
why you go to work, hmm?

11:33.833 --> 11:36.200

doing is really brave, Pauline.

you and Charles work it out.

- Oh, Cindy Vannice.

11:42.133 --> 11:44.267
- Oh.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.100
- I wrote a book

11:46.167 --> 11:47.600
about the year I lived
with that Botox lump

11:47.667 --> 11:48.900
in the middle of my forehead.

so straightforward,

13:23.667 --> 13:25.433
Okay, Kelsey, look,
the truth is,

13:25.500 --> 13:27.433
I've been at The Nest
since last night

13:27.500 --> 13:29.433
and the night before that
and--and the night before that.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.233
- I'm confused.
Are there rooms here?

13:31.300 --> 13:32.733
- No, no, there are not.

13:34.133 --> 13:36.300
I have been sleeping here

- Yes.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.400
- Why?

13:41.467 --> 13:43.200
- Because--because I was fired
from Hector and Dorff.

On Tuesday, Lindy,
Hector and Dorff's VP,

13:45.633 --> 13:47.300

13:47.367 --> 13:49.300
Lindy's insufferable
and talks so much

13:49.367 --> 13:50.967
that Hector calls her Fat Lindy,

13:51.067 --> 13:53.067
That's just his put-down
for everyone.

Anyway, I settle in
for a long, boring conversation,

13:54.700 --> 13:56.067

and she says...

13:56.100 --> 13:57.733
- You're fired.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.067
We need your work phone.

I'll be okay.

14:08.067 --> 14:09.267
You know, I was outgrowing
the company anyway,

14:09.333 --> 14:11.267

14:11.333 --> 14:12.800

why this whole thing happened.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.300
It's like living
in a giant dollhouse.

It's over-curated,
it's far too flowery,

infantilizing.

what's infantilizing?
