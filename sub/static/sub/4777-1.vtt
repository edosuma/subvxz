Hello, I'm Dot Lancaster,
film valedictorian of Hollywood.

02:00.136 --> 02:02.570
The movie you are
about to see is not real.

02:02.639 --> 02:03.731
It is a movie.

02:03.807 --> 02:06.867
Do not act things out from it
because you are disturbed

02:06.943 --> 02:09.571
or pissed off,
you crazy son of a bitch.

02:09.645 --> 02:12.080
This film contains adult language.

02:12.148 --> 02:15.584
There are 17 swearwords
carefully placed throughout.

02:15.652 --> 02:17.586
Kids, can you find them?

02:17.654 --> 02:20.088
When you hear one,
jump up and turn around.

02:20.156 --> 02:21.748
That'd crack me up.

02:21.825 --> 02:23.258
Enjoy the film.

02:44.514 --> 02:47.108
<i>Hey, there.
My name is Clay,</i>

02:47.183 --> 02:50.175
<i>and this here is the story
of Ronnie Dobbs</i>

02:50.253 --> 02:55.281
<i>and his rise to fame, and the man
that discovered him, and me.</i>

02:55.358 --> 02:59.021
<i>But let's start with ol' Ronnie.
Here he is now.</i>

03:11.307 --> 03:14.242
<i>Yeah, Ronnie was a good man,</i>

03:14.310 --> 03:17.473
<i>a true gentleman
of Southern distinction.</i>

03:17.547 --> 03:21.381
Dobbs, get your ass off my car!

03:21.451 --> 03:24.648
Sorry, man.
Thought it was mine.

03:43.172 --> 03:45.106
Get out of the way, dumb ass!

04:00.423 --> 04:02.891
- Hey, Darryl.
- Ronnie, what's up?

04:02.959 --> 04:05.052
Nothin' much.
Talmadge. Debbie.

04:05.128 --> 04:07.062
- B.J., how you doing?
- I'm fine.

04:07.130 --> 04:09.564
- Stan.
- I don't want nothin' to do with you.

04:09.632 --> 04:12.726
Damn, look at this.
He's still pissed off about last time.

04:12.802 --> 04:14.360
A'ight.

04:16.639 --> 04:19.802
- Ronnie Dobbs.
- Ain't nothin' but trouble.

04:21.310 --> 04:22.801
- Hey, Harmon.
- Hey, Ronnie.

04:22.879 --> 04:26.713
I'm sorry about doing that
to your sister, man. I forgot.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.590
<i>Ronnie sure was
a free spirit, wasn't he?</i>

04:35.658 --> 04:37.592
<i>Don't you think?</i>

04:37.660 --> 04:41.426
<i>But freedom
is the devil's handshake,</i>

04:41.497 --> 04:43.931
<i>because while his brain
was free...</i>

04:44.000 --> 04:45.262
Look who's back.

04:45.335 --> 04:46.927
Leland. Darnell.

04:47.003 --> 04:50.666
Y'all don't say nothin'.
Today's gonna be a special day.

04:51.841 --> 04:54.776
<i>... his heart belonged
to a woman.</i>

04:54.844 --> 04:56.641
Tammy!

04:57.714 --> 04:59.011
Tammy!

05:02.185 --> 05:04.244
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Hey, little Ronnie!

05:04.320 --> 05:06.720
Hey, middle Ronnie!
Hey, little middle Ronnie!

05:06.789 --> 05:08.780
What do you want,
Ronnie Dobbs?

05:08.858 --> 05:11.588
Listen, baby, I got to
ask you a question.

05:11.661 --> 05:13.151
Go ahead and ask me, then.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.492
That's what you think.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.726
It's personal and romanticized,

05:17.800 --> 05:23.295
so why don't you meet me
tonight, 8:00, at our special place.

05:23.373 --> 05:26.308
Well, how am I gonna get
a babysitter?

05:26.376 --> 05:29.573
- Ain't you got a TV?
- Yeah.

05:29.645 --> 05:31.670
A'ight, then.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.737
See you tonight.

05:39.922 --> 05:43.585
Just the two.
It's probably all there.

05:43.659 --> 05:45.456
Goddamn.

05:45.528 --> 05:48.759
Man, I know
they talking about beer,

05:48.831 --> 05:54.098
but I can think of another pair
I'd like to grab... my balls!

05:55.938 --> 05:59.135
- He don't like it.
- He hungry. He gonna eat it.

05:59.208 --> 06:01.676
Listen, hungry dog'll eat anything.

06:03.212 --> 06:04.679
Dog, eat that vomit!

06:04.747 --> 06:08.012
<i>Well, looky here!
Who's that good-looking young man?</i>

06:08.084 --> 06:11.713
<i>That's me, Clay,
storyteller to the stars...</i>

06:11.788 --> 06:13.187
<i>... at your service.</i>

06:13.256 --> 06:15.451
- He's not gonna do it!
- Yeah, he will.

06:15.525 --> 06:16.958
There he goes.

06:17.026 --> 06:20.325
Look at him!
He's eatin' it! I told you!

06:22.632 --> 06:25.760
Shoot.
Out of quarters.

06:25.835 --> 06:27.826
That's all right, little dude.

06:32.875 --> 06:36.538
<i>You've just been done
one free service by Ronnie Dobbs.</i>

06:36.612 --> 06:38.910
- Thanks, Ronnie.
- A'ight.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.518
- Hey, y'all.
- Hey, Ronnie!

06:45.588 --> 06:47.522
- Got breakfast.
- Looky there!

06:47.590 --> 06:49.751
Hey, Tonya, Kyle.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.090
Clay, sorry about your leg.

06:52.161 --> 06:54.891
Next time we out drinking,
you should do the driving.

06:54.964 --> 06:57.865
That's all right, man.
Guess what.

06:57.934 --> 07:00.869
I was a little bit wasted
my own self.

07:00.937 --> 07:02.734
- A'ight.
- You know? Okay?

07:02.805 --> 07:05.205
You two are a regular
ol' Three Musketeers.

07:05.274 --> 07:07.902
<i>We are. Touch?</i>

07:07.977 --> 07:11.378
Now, I swear,
if I didn't know any better,

07:11.447 --> 07:15.110
I'd say that I was
about to ask Tammy to marry me.

07:16.152 --> 07:18.620
Are you? For real?

07:18.688 --> 07:20.121
That is sweet.

07:20.189 --> 07:22.282
You two belong together forever.

07:22.358 --> 07:25.020
Hell, you done proved it
three times.

07:25.094 --> 07:29.724
<i>You see, Tammy was Ronnie's
sweetheart since elementary school.</i>

07:29.799 --> 07:34.133
<i>The day that Ronnie got kicked off
the bus for farting the alphabet,</i>

07:34.203 --> 07:36.433
<i>Tammy went along with him.</i>

07:36.506 --> 07:39.532
<i>After that,
they was inseparable.</i>

07:44.180 --> 07:48.913
<i>Then, at the ripe age of 12,
Ronnie made it official.</i>

07:48.985 --> 07:50.475
Marry me.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.282
<i>After they got divorced,</i>

07:52.355 --> 07:56.416
<i>Ronnie loved on Tammy so much
he asked her to marry him again.</i>

07:56.492 --> 07:59.325
Would you marry me
yet again, milady?

07:59.395 --> 08:00.657
Yes.

08:00.730 --> 08:04.860
<i>After the second divorce,
as if by Cupid's magic,</i>

08:04.934 --> 08:07.698
<i>he was destined
to ask a third time.</i>

08:07.770 --> 08:11.797
I was thinkin' maybe, you know,
we should get married again.

08:11.874 --> 08:13.341
'Kay.

08:13.409 --> 08:16.640
<i>Science tells us
that the third time's a charm,</i>

08:16.712 --> 08:19.704
<i>but this time,
science failed us.</i>

08:19.782 --> 08:21.545
<i>See? Science don't know.</i>

08:23.186 --> 08:26.519
Shit! Look who's here!
Johnny Law man.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.786
- Get over here, son.
- Dad, I just got unlimited lives!

08:31.194 --> 08:32.660
You got no life!

08:32.727 --> 08:35.094
You're not supposed to be
playing them damn games!

08:35.164 --> 08:38.621
I done told you before! You ain't never
gonna learn anything from them.

08:38.701 --> 08:42.068
Man, why don't you
leave him alone?

08:42.138 --> 08:44.072
You lookin' for an ass to kick?

08:44.140 --> 08:47.837
'Cause I got one...
my face and your ass!

08:51.247 --> 08:54.011
You think you're
really clever, don't you, boy?

08:54.083 --> 08:55.675
Let me tell you something.

08:55.751 --> 08:58.185
When I get elected governor...
and I'm gonna...

08:58.254 --> 09:03.317
the first thing I'm gonna do
is put all you scum in jail.

09:03.392 --> 09:05.326
You know the second thing
I'm gonna do?

09:05.394 --> 09:08.989
First, send to jail.
Second... oh, yeah.

09:09.065 --> 09:12.034
Go to the faggot store,
buy yourself a new mustache.

09:13.936 --> 09:15.164
No.

09:16.038 --> 09:19.201
I'm gonna make sure
you never get out again.

09:19.275 --> 09:21.903
You hear me talking to you, boy?

09:23.312 --> 09:26.975
Why don't you bunch of losers try
to find something useful to do...

09:28.050 --> 09:30.211
...like killing yourselves.

09:34.790 --> 09:38.556
You just lost my vote. That's it.
You done did it this time.

09:38.628 --> 09:40.152
Smart campaigning.

09:40.229 --> 09:42.891
See you later, little dude.
A'ight.

09:45.234 --> 09:47.134
- Dumb dick.
- Dumb dick.

09:47.203 --> 09:49.228
Man, hand me
one of them cold beers.

09:49.305 --> 09:53.571
- Who?
- We accidentally drank 'em.

09:53.643 --> 09:54.803
What, all of 'em?

09:54.877 --> 09:58.904
You was gone a long while there,
you know, taking on the big man,

09:58.981 --> 10:00.915
like you should, you know...

10:00.983 --> 10:03.076
- Goddamn!
- Goddamnit!

10:03.152 --> 10:06.679
Come on, man, this is your last few
hours of bachelorhood-ness.

10:06.756 --> 10:08.485
You gotta make the most of 'em.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.754
Kyle's right, Ronnie.

10:10.826 --> 10:13.260
Yeah, you right.
You right.

10:13.329 --> 10:14.421
A'ight.

10:14.497 --> 10:18.024
Clay, let's you and me
go fuck up that Piggy-Wiggy sign!

10:18.100 --> 10:19.089
Come on!

10:19.168 --> 10:21.636
<i>Ronnie came up
with the greatest plans,</i>

10:21.704 --> 10:25.435
<i>but some how they all
ended up the same way.</i>

10:25.508 --> 10:28.170
- A child shall lead them!
- I want y'all to fuck it up!

10:29.679 --> 10:33.115
We've got a disturbance call,
possible break-in.

10:33.182 --> 10:35.446
Get these all the time.
It's routine.

10:35.518 --> 10:36.780
Could be anything.

10:36.852 --> 10:38.945
- You keep an eye out.
- Right.

10:39.021 --> 10:41.114
Ronnie's in it.
Ronnie Dobbs.

10:41.190 --> 10:44.626
Well, look here.
It's his old pal Clay.

10:44.694 --> 10:47.128
I'm gonna go looking
for Ronnie. He can't be far.

10:47.196 --> 10:48.220
Hey, Clay.

10:48.297 --> 10:50.288
We're gonna need
a paramedic up here.

10:50.366 --> 10:52.630
- You all right, son?
- I'm good.

10:52.702 --> 10:54.761
You don't look so good.

10:54.837 --> 10:58.637
I'll be all right
when we get to pass-out time.

11:00.142 --> 11:02.133
- Ronnie!
- Hey, Darnetta.

11:02.211 --> 11:04.236
I heard the noise.
I heard him.

11:04.313 --> 11:06.406
He went thataw ay,
tow ard that house there.

11:06.482 --> 11:07.574
- One man?
- One man.

11:07.650 --> 11:10.619
That way. I heard him.
I seed him. One man, yonder.

11:10.686 --> 11:14.247
I gots a condition,
and I didn't get to take my pills.

11:14.323 --> 11:17.019
I know. You go back inside
and take your pills.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.084
My husband Donnie's
supposed to bring the pills.

11:19.161 --> 11:21.595
He's supposed to bring 'em.
He's supposed to.

11:21.964 --> 11:24.455
- There he goes!
- Yeah!

11:24.533 --> 11:27.093
Dispatch, we've got
a 10-80 on foot.

11:27.169 --> 11:29.933
Ronnie, let's don't do this again!

11:30.005 --> 11:31.097
Fuck!

11:33.175 --> 11:35.006
Watch out for this dog!

11:35.611 --> 11:37.602
Come on, Ronnie,
let's make this easy!

11:38.914 --> 11:39.938
Hey, Travis.

11:40.716 --> 11:42.946
Hell, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

11:49.859 --> 11:51.850
He's fixing to go out!

11:53.696 --> 11:55.459
Dobbs! Come on!

11:55.531 --> 11:57.328
I'm slippery, ain't I?

11:57.400 --> 11:59.561
Damn it, Ronnie!
Come on back here!

11:59.635 --> 12:01.068
Oh, God.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.628
- Just chasing somebody, ma'am.
- Excuse us, ma'am.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.302
Come on, now, Ronnie!

12:08.644 --> 12:10.236
Ronnie, come on back here!

12:10.312 --> 12:12.405
Cameraman!
Want to know a secret?

12:13.482 --> 12:15.245
- Here he is!
- He's back in here!

12:16.118 --> 12:19.087
<i>- Ronnie, get over here!
- Hold it right there!</i>

12:19.155 --> 12:21.589
<i>Bill, he just ran
on down to Darnetta's.</i>

12:21.657 --> 12:24.091
<i>I'll go down to the end of the street
and cut him off.</i>

12:24.160 --> 12:25.422
Here they come.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.485
Praise the Lord!
I hope they catch him!

12:33.836 --> 12:35.599
Ronnie, where are you?

12:35.671 --> 12:38.265
Damn it, now here
did you go hidin' at?

12:38.340 --> 12:42.276
Dobbs, we gonna get you
the next time, boy!

12:42.344 --> 12:44.938
We gonna get you
and bring you in!

12:45.014 --> 12:47.608
Hey, officers.
I was takin' a nap.

12:47.683 --> 12:50.049
- Roll over, Ronnie.
- Damn it, Ronnie!

12:50.119 --> 12:51.108
Roll over!

12:51.187 --> 12:53.951
I was sleeping! What?
I was just sleeping!

12:54.023 --> 12:56.651
I was in my home,
my new home!

12:56.725 --> 12:58.716
What did I do?
I didn't do nothing!

12:58.794 --> 13:02.389
<i>- You're going downtown.
- You going downtown!</i>

13:02.465 --> 13:05.127
- You done...
- Police brutality!

13:05.201 --> 13:07.931
Y'all are brutalizing me!

13:08.003 --> 13:10.767
<i>I don't know
what bothered that sheriff more ...</i>

13:10.840 --> 13:14.401
<i>Ronnie raising hell or his arrest
making them TVcop shows.</i>

13:14.477 --> 13:17.571
<i>... captured on TV film!</i>

13:21.984 --> 13:23.918
<i>Y'all is brutalizing me!</i>

13:25.154 --> 13:26.917
<i>Get the hell away from me!</i>

13:26.989 --> 13:30.288
<i>- Sit back, Ronnie!
- You sit back, Ronnie.</i>

13:30.359 --> 13:31.792
<i>Did he spit on your camera?</i>

13:31.861 --> 13:34.159
<i>Come on, man,
what you doin' this for?</i>

13:36.165 --> 13:39.464
I want my rights!
I want a lobster dinner!

13:39.535 --> 13:42.333
I want my free phone call to Paris!

13:42.404 --> 13:45.771
Keep it down, Dobbs.
You got a visitor.

13:45.841 --> 13:49.242
- Tammy, do you want your chair?
- No. It's okay, Joey.

13:50.312 --> 13:53.804
Hey, baby.
You look very good today.

13:53.883 --> 13:56.818
Ronnie Dobbs, I waited
all night at Jumbo Jimbo's.

13:56.886 --> 13:59.855
- I was gonna...
- I guess you're right, though.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.686
"Meet me at our special place."
I should have come here.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.727
Baby, hang on.
Don't flip your bitch switch.

14:05.794 --> 14:10.060
I got a personalized,
romanticized question to ask you,

14:10.132 --> 14:11.827
so pay my fine.

14:12.368 --> 14:13.562
Not this time.

14:14.136 --> 14:16.127
You're gonna want
the right to change your mind

14:16.205 --> 14:19.732
when I ask the most majestic
of all questions.

14:22.411 --> 14:23.742
Tammy Dupris...

14:24.914 --> 14:28.975
...on this veritable occasion,
will you marry me?

14:30.519 --> 14:32.350
No.

14:32.421 --> 14:34.582
Baby, that's great.
This one's...

14:36.492 --> 14:37.618
What?

14:37.693 --> 14:40.161
No. The answer is no.

14:40.229 --> 14:43.960
Tammy, I just asked you
to marry me.

14:44.033 --> 14:45.057
No!

14:45.134 --> 14:47.864
I did. You need to clean
the shit out your ears.

14:47.937 --> 14:52.533
I heard what you said, but I ain't
gonna marry you until you change.

14:52.608 --> 14:54.371
Change?
What you talkin' about?

14:54.443 --> 14:56.274
I'm tired of all this!

14:56.345 --> 14:59.872
I'm tired of bailing you out of jail,
making excuses to the little Ronnies

14:59.949 --> 15:02.713
when they say,
"Why ain't Daddy at my birthday?"

15:02.785 --> 15:07.313
He's too busy peeing in a water tower
or stealing a ice cream truck, naked.

15:07.389 --> 15:10.051
First of all, okay,
I already explained.

15:10.125 --> 15:12.355
That ice cream truck
was for the kids, okay?

15:12.428 --> 15:14.487
<i>That was part of
a civic community service.</i>

15:14.563 --> 15:17.464
Second of all,
that water tower was asking for it.

15:17.533 --> 15:19.524
You can ask anybody!

15:19.602 --> 15:21.570
Listen to me.

15:21.637 --> 15:24.197
Everyone has some kind of talent.

15:24.273 --> 15:28.733
You just gotta find out what yours is
and make something of yourself.

15:28.811 --> 15:32.577
Until you do,
the answer is no.

15:33.115 --> 15:34.480
Tammy, come on!

15:36.485 --> 15:40.421
<i>Yep, Ronnie was hitting
new lows left and right,</i>

15:40.489 --> 15:44.425
<i>but little did he know,
thousands of miles away</i>

15:44.493 --> 15:47.326
<i>there was a city called Hollywood.</i>

15:47.496 --> 15:50.590
<i>Welcome to Thrilling Miracles!</i>

15:54.603 --> 15:58.699
Here he is, all the way
from the country of Britain...

15:58.774 --> 16:01.140
Terry Twillstein!

16:02.611 --> 16:03.942
Hello-hello, Nancy!

16:04.013 --> 16:05.742
Good to see you all!

16:05.814 --> 16:09.477
What's the number one problem
in the modern kitchen today?

16:09.551 --> 16:11.018
I don't know.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.952
Nobody knows!

16:14.023 --> 16:16.491
It's food!

16:18.327 --> 16:20.693
That's why I've invented
the new...

16:21.697 --> 16:24.325
...Food-Erator!

16:25.701 --> 16:28.898
All you do is take
your nicely prepared meal,

16:28.971 --> 16:31.337
chop it up into little bits,

16:31.407 --> 16:34.069
feed it into the Food-Erator,

16:34.143 --> 16:38.842
drop some of the special
Food-Erator green slop in there...

16:39.648 --> 16:41.616
You're off!

16:41.684 --> 16:45.347
It absolutely destroys food!

16:45.421 --> 16:47.446
Like magic!

16:58.267 --> 17:00.633
Never mind!

17:00.703 --> 17:03.194
Right there where...
Could you rewind it?

17:04.239 --> 17:06.332
<i>Go back.
Right there.</i>

17:06.407 --> 17:08.137
That moment right there.

17:08.210 --> 17:13.307
That blooper where the blade leaps
out of the machine into her chest...

17:13.382 --> 17:18.217
think you could do some of your
Hollywood magic and just cut that out?

17:18.287 --> 17:19.617
No.

17:19.688 --> 17:22.851
We don't have
that kind of equipment here.

17:27.429 --> 17:31.798
- But I think it could hurt sales!
- Hopefully!

17:35.738 --> 17:37.205
You gotta come see this.

17:37.272 --> 17:39.934
We got more footage of that
Ronnie Dobbs guy getting arrested.

17:40.008 --> 17:40.997
Sweet.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.315
I have nothing.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.652
I'm a failure!

17:58.761 --> 18:01.195
<i>If only I had some thing...</i>

18:02.064 --> 18:04.589
<i>... something that people
actually wanted...</i>

18:05.534 --> 18:07.525
...that I could sell to them.

18:13.609 --> 18:15.474
? Something?

18:15.544 --> 18:17.444
? To sell?

18:19.448 --> 18:21.211
? Something?

18:21.283 --> 18:25.617
? To sell?

18:29.691 --> 18:32.091
<i>Pretty more mma,
how you doin'?</i>

18:32.161 --> 18:34.527
<i>I'm doin' fine.
How you doin'?</i>

18:34.596 --> 18:37.292
<i>A'ight.
How much for a suck-off?</i>

18:41.103 --> 18:43.162
<i>All right, you're under arrest.</i>

18:43.238 --> 18:45.229
<i>You can't arrest me!
You're a hooker!</i>

18:45.307 --> 18:48.208
<i>- I'm undercover.
- Then you shouldn't be hooking.</i>

18:49.077 --> 18:50.567
<i>Out of the car.</i>

18:50.646 --> 18:54.241
This guy Ronnie Dobbs, he's been
arrested on TV a bunch of times.

18:54.316 --> 18:55.806
<i>You're under arrest.</i>

18:55.884 --> 19:00.253
<i>No, man, y'all need to arrest her!
She's a hooker!</i>

19:00.322 --> 19:04.053
<i>Your police de partment
is filled with prostitution!</i>

19:04.126 --> 19:05.559
<i>Come on!</i>

19:05.627 --> 19:07.891
<i>I ain't done nothing!</i>

19:07.963 --> 19:10.659
<i>I didn't even get my suck-off!</i>

19:13.168 --> 19:16.137
He's a true American hero, man.

19:16.205 --> 19:19.936
<i>You need to arrest the lady,
is what I'm sayin' to you.</i>

19:20.008 --> 19:21.635
Go to the next one.

19:22.678 --> 19:23.979
<i>You got to know,
she's a professional lie-ologist.</i>

19:23.979 --> 19:26.072
<i>You got to know,
she's a professional lie-ologist.</i>

19:26.148 --> 19:28.173
<i>You took my money and drank it!</i>

19:28.250 --> 19:31.242
<i>- I did not drink!
- That's all you got to do.</i>

19:31.320 --> 19:33.754
<i>Stop.
One person talk at a time.</i>

19:33.822 --> 19:38.282
<i>... to the handicaps
as a gift for the season.</i>

19:38.360 --> 19:41.295
<i>That's what happened.
I was out on a midnight ride...</i>

19:41.363 --> 19:43.058
<i>I bought these plates!</i>

19:43.131 --> 19:47.192
<i>That is my wedding dishes!
Ronnie, those are my good dishes!</i>

19:47.269 --> 19:50.363
<i>Now you done it, Tammy!
A'ight, Tammy, good!</i>

19:50.439 --> 19:53.431
- He should have his own show.
- Now, that I'd watch.

19:53.508 --> 19:55.442
<i>Come down and bail me out!</i>

19:55.510 --> 19:57.501
<i>We'll see about that!</i>

19:57.579 --> 19:59.774
<i>I'm gonna be
in cell number seven!</i>

19:59.848 --> 20:01.042
<i>Come get me!</i>

20:01.216 --> 20:03.309
<i>I'm coming in!
I know it!</i>

20:03.385 --> 20:04.682
Tallyho, all!

20:04.753 --> 20:06.653
Is this perchance
Tas-Tee Liquors?

20:06.722 --> 20:07.222
I don't know, faggot!

20:07.222 --> 20:08.348
I don't know, faggot!

20:11.059 --> 20:13.619
I've been looking all day long.

20:13.695 --> 20:16.186
What would you say if I told you

20:16.265 --> 20:20.099
that I was looking for
a Ronwell Quincy Dobbs?

20:20.836 --> 20:22.531
I'd say "Huh," too.

20:22.604 --> 20:25.732
Perhaps he goes by
the appellation of Ronnie.

20:25.807 --> 20:28.640
That fucker been lyin' to you!
He ain't from no Appalachia!

20:28.710 --> 20:30.302
So you know him?

20:30.379 --> 20:32.370
Hell, yeah!
Ronnie Dobbs!

20:32.447 --> 20:35.610
Ronnie said he and Clay
was headed over to Duke's Last Call.

20:35.684 --> 20:37.618
Just over the railroad tracks.

20:37.686 --> 20:40.154
What great good luck!

20:44.526 --> 20:46.653
Good shot!

20:47.796 --> 20:48.990
Thank you!

20:49.064 --> 20:51.225
Run on, fancy pants!

20:51.300 --> 20:53.291
Get out of the way!
Back up! Get out of the way!

20:53.368 --> 20:55.529
Damn that Ronnie Dobbs!

20:55.604 --> 20:57.435
Ronnie Dobbs was here, yes?

20:57.506 --> 21:00.066
- You a friend of Dobbs?
- I'd like to be, sir.

21:01.376 --> 21:03.310
You tell that little asshole

21:03.378 --> 21:06.905
next time he feels like pulling a prank
and lighting his shit on fire,

21:06.982 --> 21:08.973
do it in somebody else's bar.

21:09.051 --> 21:11.781
You hear that, Dobbs?

21:21.129 --> 21:25.065
- The dance is ruined!
- Please. Damn that Dobbs.

21:25.133 --> 21:27.226
That's the one.
Have you seen him?

21:33.442 --> 21:34.704
Look out!

21:36.144 --> 21:38.237
I'm the principal!

21:44.152 --> 21:46.086
Let's get it, Ronnie!

21:46.154 --> 21:48.179
- Kids, get home!
- Look out!

21:48.256 --> 21:50.224
Get out of the way!

21:50.292 --> 21:52.021
Run for your lives!

21:56.665 --> 21:58.098
Magic!

22:03.138 --> 22:04.696
Glorious!

22:24.126 --> 22:26.651
This shit's gotta stop.

22:26.728 --> 22:28.559
Run, Clay, run!

22:28.630 --> 22:29.961
Thanks, chum!

22:30.032 --> 22:31.556
Wait up, y'all!

22:38.006 --> 22:39.803
Mr. Dobbs, slow down!

22:39.875 --> 22:43.868
- I didn't do nothing!
- I'm not with the coppers!

22:43.945 --> 22:46.641
- Please!
- You got the wrong man!

22:46.715 --> 22:49.582
I'm here to proposition you!

22:51.086 --> 22:54.021
- Get off me!
- Hear me out!

22:54.089 --> 22:55.750
You ain't a cop!

22:55.824 --> 22:58.520
My name is Terry,
and I'm from Hollywood.

22:58.593 --> 23:01.027
Ronnie, you are not
like other men.

23:01.096 --> 23:05.362
You've got something,
something special, and I want it badly.

23:06.034 --> 23:09.026
I want to be the man
behind the man!

23:09.104 --> 23:12.540
I realize I'm coming
all over you here,

23:12.607 --> 23:15.041
but it's been building up
inside of me for weeks,

23:15.110 --> 23:17.408
and I can't control myself.

23:17.479 --> 23:21.313
Listen, sir, let me show you
what you've got inside of you,

23:21.383 --> 23:26.844
what could be inside of you if you'd just
give me the tiniest hole of opportunity!

23:26.922 --> 23:30.915
We can go back to your place
right now, and I'll pack your shit!

23:30.992 --> 23:32.823
Help! Police!

23:32.894 --> 23:34.293
Him!

23:34.362 --> 23:37.160
- You two get down from there.
- He's the one you want!

23:37.833 --> 23:39.824
- I'm coming!
- It's okay, officers!

23:39.901 --> 23:42.426
Everything's fine!
I'm from Hollywood!

23:45.073 --> 23:47.098
Wait. Hold on.
There's more.

23:47.175 --> 23:49.803
I'll pay Mr. Dobbs' fine.
You release him to me.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.507
No dice, precious.

23:52.581 --> 23:57.314
What if I told you that I'd take him
out of this town, the county...

23:57.385 --> 24:00.548
wait a second...
the entire state, for good?

24:02.224 --> 24:03.589
For good?

24:05.894 --> 24:07.452
He's yours.

24:08.463 --> 24:11.398
But if he ever
shows up here again,

24:11.466 --> 24:13.730
I'm gonna put him in jail
for the rest of his life.

24:13.802 --> 24:17.636
And I ain't hardly bullshitting!
You understand me, boy?

24:17.706 --> 24:19.640
You've got yourself a deal!

24:20.909 --> 24:24.401
And I'll throw in
the fabulous Nickel Holder!

24:24.479 --> 24:27.414
The problem with nickels is,
you're always losing them!

24:27.482 --> 24:29.382
It holds one nickel!

24:38.727 --> 24:40.718
Man, where you from, anyhow?

24:41.763 --> 24:44.698
I'm from Britain.
There. My green card.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.763
<i>- Terry Twillstein?
- At your service.</i>

24:48.837 --> 24:50.862
What's all these?

24:50.939 --> 24:52.873
Those are my babies.

24:52.941 --> 24:55.876
That's the Salad Evaporator.
Sucks dressing off of salads.

24:55.944 --> 24:57.434
No one bought it.

24:57.512 --> 25:00.777
That's the Vomit Whip.
Turns vomit back into food!

25:00.849 --> 25:03.750
And the Fish Magician hides fish.

25:03.818 --> 25:05.479
No one bought it.

25:05.554 --> 25:09.217
Man, look, what do you want
with me, anyway?

25:09.291 --> 25:11.282
You're my latest product.

25:11.359 --> 25:15.056
I'm gonna take you to Hollywood
and build a TV show around you

25:15.130 --> 25:16.461
and your talents.

25:16.531 --> 25:18.726
What talents?

25:18.800 --> 25:20.290
For getting arrested.

25:20.368 --> 25:22.928
- I don't want to get arrested.
- I know you don't.

25:23.004 --> 25:25.165
That's why you run so fast
from the coppers

25:25.240 --> 25:28.004
and you spin
such fabulous yarns.

25:29.044 --> 25:31.410
My talents.

25:31.479 --> 25:32.571
That's right!

25:32.647 --> 25:35.013
All you'll have to do
is what you already do do.

25:35.083 --> 25:37.313
I hope you don't mind
becoming rich and famous.

25:38.353 --> 25:39.581
Hell no!

25:43.592 --> 25:46.060
I could get into that, man.

25:46.761 --> 25:49.924
You know, Ronnie,
you and I are a lot alike.

25:49.998 --> 25:51.989
We both come
from a place where...

25:52.067 --> 25:54.001
Shut the fuck up a second.
Pull in here.

25:54.069 --> 25:57.038
- Something I want to get for the trip.
- Okay. Sure.

25:57.105 --> 26:00.632
Just take a second, a'ight?
Just keep the car running, a'ight?

26:00.709 --> 26:02.904
- Sure, Ronnie.
- Hey, Ronnie!

26:02.978 --> 26:04.206
Hey, Clay!

26:04.279 --> 26:07.680
Sorry about that bus flipping over.
Next time you gotta drive.

26:07.749 --> 26:10.217
That's all right.
It was my fault.

26:10.285 --> 26:13.686
Doesn't matter. Doesn't hurt anyway.
I can't feel my legs.

26:13.755 --> 26:16.485
- You lucky.
- Rock on.

26:16.558 --> 26:18.526
- A'ight.
- A'ight.

26:20.862 --> 26:24.389
- Hello.
- This here's a right nice car.

26:26.067 --> 26:29.696
I'm a friend of Ronnie's,
so I'll just slip in the backseat.

26:29.771 --> 26:31.898
No, that's not necessary.

26:31.973 --> 26:34.498
License and registration, please.

26:34.576 --> 26:37.511
- You're frightening me, hillbilly.
- Am I?

26:37.579 --> 26:40.446
Listen, why don't you
get me in this golden chariot

26:40.515 --> 26:42.506
and take me once
around the gas pumps?

26:42.584 --> 26:44.575
Why don't you
go bother someone else?

26:44.653 --> 26:48.180
- Just let me in there!
- No! Please, no!

26:48.256 --> 26:51.885
Mercy sakes! You're not from around
these here parts, are you, fish 'n' chips?

26:51.960 --> 26:52.949
- Dobbs!
- Run, Clay!

26:53.028 --> 26:54.655
- Come back!
- Free six-pack!

26:55.697 --> 26:58.097
Little dogies!
Get over here now!

26:58.166 --> 26:59.793
A'ight, let's go.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.062
Behind you!

27:02.937 --> 27:05.030
- My bad.
- Just go.

27:05.106 --> 27:07.267
Dobbs!
Goddamnit!

27:07.342 --> 27:09.139
- You little son of a...
- Go, go, go, go!

27:10.612 --> 27:11.601
Come back here!

27:11.680 --> 27:13.443
Next stop, Hollywood.

27:13.615 --> 27:16.140
Next stop, Hollywood!

27:16.318 --> 27:19.048
Next stop, Hollywood!

27:21.056 --> 27:24.116
Yeah, come here.
Sweet relief.

27:25.860 --> 27:27.487
<i>? Look at that sky?</i>

27:27.562 --> 27:29.189
<i>? Look at that hooker?</i>

27:29.264 --> 27:31.129
<i>? She's blowin' that guy?</i>

27:31.199 --> 27:33.724
<i>? I loathe L.A.?</i>

27:35.036 --> 27:36.697
<i>? I loathe L.A.?</i>

27:36.771 --> 27:39.501
<i>That's I Loathe L.A.
By Daffy Mal Yinkle-Yankle,</i>

27:39.574 --> 27:42.509
<i>a hilarious takeoff
on that other song.</i>

27:42.577 --> 27:46.035
<i>Come to Hummers in Redondo Beach
tonight from 9:00 until 2:00.</i>

27:46.114 --> 27:49.242
<i>Guys, bring your boners,
'cause we're giving away tits!</i>

27:49.317 --> 27:52.912
It's a regular dream factory!

27:52.987 --> 27:56.650
Well, wake up, Ronnie,
'cause it's all too real!

27:56.725 --> 28:00.456
Now, let's get in there
and grab 'em by the nuts!

28:00.528 --> 28:03.190
What?
Let's do what to who?

28:16.745 --> 28:20.647
Okay. I'm holding
the deciding ballot.

28:22.417 --> 28:23.714
Let's see who's voted out.

28:35.530 --> 28:37.555
Bring me your torch.

28:46.307 --> 28:47.831
Tough break, kid.

28:59.654 --> 29:00.643
All right.

29:10.098 --> 29:11.122
And now...

29:13.368 --> 29:14.767
...we feast!

29:32.120 --> 29:33.815
This show is killing us,

29:33.888 --> 29:37.221
but we need one of these
reality-based shows to compete.

29:37.292 --> 29:38.884
Absolutely, Bob.
Well?

29:38.960 --> 29:41.952
<i>Mr. Webber, Terry Twillstein
is here to see you.</i>

29:42.030 --> 29:43.463
Send them in.

29:45.633 --> 29:47.965
Hello-hello!
My name's Terry Twillstein.

29:48.036 --> 29:51.096
Hello, how are you?
That's a fine how-do-you-do.

29:51.172 --> 29:53.663
I have a TV show that features

29:53.741 --> 29:57.905
cops, mayhem, chases,
and roustabouts!

29:57.979 --> 29:59.503
What do you think?

30:00.715 --> 30:03.309
<i>Sounds a lot like the show Fuzz.</i>

30:03.985 --> 30:06.385
Been there, done that.

30:06.454 --> 30:08.422
You drive a hard bargain, sir.

30:08.490 --> 30:10.890
What if I told you I'd take you
to a place you'd never been

30:10.959 --> 30:13.450
and do something to you
that's never been done?

30:13.528 --> 30:16.964
See, my show features
just one man, a single man,

30:17.031 --> 30:20.228
getting arrested every week
in a different city.

30:20.301 --> 30:23.668
That way people could feel for him
and grow to love him,

30:23.738 --> 30:25.797
and he could be a hero,
a man of the people,

30:25.874 --> 30:29.435
a common man with a silver tongue
and wings on his feet.

30:29.511 --> 30:32.378
I'm talking about Ronnie Dobbs.

30:34.949 --> 30:36.883
Don't mind if I do.

30:38.686 --> 30:39.948
Well...

30:40.922 --> 30:43.982
My immediate reaction is no,

30:44.058 --> 30:46.390
but I've got kind of
a "yessy" aftertaste.

30:47.228 --> 30:50.220
Part of me loves it,
and then this other part of me

30:50.298 --> 30:54.064
hates the first part for loving it,
'cause the second part hates it.

30:54.135 --> 30:55.193
Fran?

30:57.672 --> 30:59.139
I'm forgainst it.

31:16.491 --> 31:20.018
Well, I gotta say, I love it.

31:21.062 --> 31:22.154
Really?

31:23.197 --> 31:27.793
Well, it looks to me like
you've got yourself a show!

31:27.869 --> 31:30.269
Congratulations!

31:30.338 --> 31:32.863
- Twillstein, right?
- Yeah.

31:36.144 --> 31:39.602
<i>That Terry fellow,
he masterminded the whole thing</i>

31:39.681 --> 31:44.709
<i>like some genius Einstein from hell
meets the Wolf Man on steroids.</i>

31:44.786 --> 31:46.219
Then Ronnie gets arrested.

31:46.287 --> 31:48.050
Get him in the car,
get the car pulling away.

31:48.122 --> 31:50.556
Boom! Magic! Perfect!

31:50.625 --> 31:52.388
<i>That was it.</i>

31:52.460 --> 31:54.360
<i>Ronnie was off and running...</i>

31:54.429 --> 31:58.331
<i>but not too fast,
or there wouldn't be no show!</i>

31:58.399 --> 31:59.388
<i>Good dog!</i>

31:59.467 --> 32:02.732
<i>May I have one second to pet the dog
and let him know I'm friendly?</i>

32:02.804 --> 32:04.396
<i>I mean you no harm, dog!</i>

32:04.472 --> 32:07.737
<i>Look at me!
I'm like an astronaut!</i>

32:09.143 --> 32:12.237
<i>I want my right to remain silent!</i>

32:12.313 --> 32:15.407
<i>This goat ate my shoes
and my shirt and my hat...</i>

32:15.483 --> 32:17.747
<i>...and my wallet and my ring.
- Put the goat down.</i>

32:17.819 --> 32:20.413
<i>You put the goat down!</i>

32:20.488 --> 32:22.581
<i>Arrest this goat!
Arrest him!</i>

32:22.657 --> 32:23.885
<i>Listen here.</i>

32:23.958 --> 32:25.585
<i>You think people liked it?</i>

32:25.660 --> 32:26.649
Run, Ronnie, run!

32:26.728 --> 32:29.754
<i>Hell, yes, they liked it,
and if they paid attention,</i>

32:29.831 --> 32:32.459
<i>they just might learn
a thing or two.</i>

32:32.533 --> 32:34.262
You come down from there!

32:34.335 --> 32:36.565
<i>I'm the one who called.
He's right over here.</i>

32:36.638 --> 32:39.198
<i>We're checking out
a possible B & E at Al's Auto Shop.</i>

32:39.273 --> 32:40.706
<i>There he is, right there.</i>

32:40.775 --> 32:43.403
<i>I don't know what to tell y'all.</i>

32:43.478 --> 32:46.538
<i>This crazy drunk maniac
comes running in here...</i>

32:46.614 --> 32:48.206
<i>I have a complaint to make.</i>

32:48.282 --> 32:50.307
<i>I want to register a reward for me</i>

32:50.385 --> 32:53.218
<i>because this man
was impersonating Elvis,</i>

32:53.287 --> 32:54.982
<i>and I stopped him.</i>

32:55.056 --> 32:57.889
<i>Officer, he took my hair.
I've got a show to do tonight.</i>

32:57.959 --> 33:00.757
<i>I took Elvis' hair.
I'm gonna go return it to him.</i>

33:00.828 --> 33:02.386
<i>He hit me!</i>

33:02.463 --> 33:06.729
<i>Fake Elvis has been perpetrating
a crime against a true American hero!</i>

33:06.801 --> 33:09.235
<i>I don't need this, officer.
I got three kids.</i>

33:09.303 --> 33:11.294
<i>I don't need maniacs in my show...</i>

33:11.372 --> 33:12.532
<i>What happened?</i>

33:13.875 --> 33:15.866
<i>Man, I was hanging out here,</i>

33:15.943 --> 33:18.844
<i>and this crazy, drunk more therfucker
came running up and...</i>

33:18.913 --> 33:20.904
<i>There he goes, officers!
There he goes!</i>

33:20.982 --> 33:23.746
<i>Look at him!
There's the perpetrator! 10-20!</i>

33:23.818 --> 33:24.910
<i>Police department.</i>

33:24.986 --> 33:26.419
<i>Stay back.</i>

33:26.487 --> 33:28.318
<i>Not too close.</i>

33:28.389 --> 33:31.415
<i>- You seen anybody in here?
- Went through there.</i>

33:31.492 --> 33:32.857
<i>Here he is.</i>

33:32.927 --> 33:34.792
<i>What are you doing in here?</i>

33:34.862 --> 33:36.830
Look at Daddy!

33:36.898 --> 33:38.126
<i>Do you live here?</i>

33:38.199 --> 33:40.360
<i>Yeah, I lived here first,</i>

33:40.435 --> 33:42.335
<i>and then these people
built a house around me</i>

33:42.403 --> 33:44.234
<i>and didn't even check with me.</i>

33:44.305 --> 33:47.206
<i>You think Tammy didn't notice?
Is that what you think?</i>

33:47.275 --> 33:51.541
<i>Listen, think again,
and think right this time, will ya?</i>

33:51.612 --> 33:53.102
<i>Can't a man sleep
in his cabinet?</i>

33:58.286 --> 34:00.914
<i>Y'all got banana on me!</i>

34:12.033 --> 34:15.059
Y'all got the wrong man.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.331
Okay, listen up.
I was just stealing myself, okay?

34:17.405 --> 34:20.067
<i>I signed a contract
with the devil at a restaurant.</i>

34:20.141 --> 34:22.507
<i>I have the contract,
and the devil...</i>

34:22.577 --> 34:25.478
<i>The devil took my soul!
Dude, we got this off the devil!</i>

34:25.545 --> 34:28.572
<i>The devil's loose
amongst men in New York City!</i>

34:28.649 --> 34:31.208
<i>Begone, Satan!</i>

34:31.284 --> 34:34.014
<i>No, you got the wrong man!</i>

34:34.088 --> 34:35.851
<i>Have you had
some thing to drink tonight?</i>

34:35.922 --> 34:37.686
<i>- Drink?
- Yeah. Alcohol.</i>

34:37.759 --> 34:40.523
<i>I ain't... up.</i>

34:40.594 --> 34:43.655
<i>I was on my way to get... up,
but you... that up.</i>

34:43.731 --> 34:44.719
<i>Congratulations to you.</i>

34:44.799 --> 34:44.899
That's four bleeps, man.

34:44.899 --> 34:46.696
That's four bleeps, man.

34:46.768 --> 34:48.201
Let's do it!

34:48.268 --> 34:50.897
Drink, drink, drink, drink!

34:55.443 --> 34:56.876
<i>I don't speak French!</i>

34:56.944 --> 34:59.606
<i>Fuck!</i>

35:01.282 --> 35:03.250
<i>Speak English,
more therfucker! Come on!</i>

35:03.317 --> 35:05.410
<i>You are under arrest.
Shut up!</i>

35:05.486 --> 35:07.249
<i>Okay.
I understood that one.</i>

35:10.291 --> 35:13.226
<i>I'm being chained!
I am a chained man!</i>

35:13.294 --> 35:17.321
<i>Boy, did it take off,
quicker than Ronnie could count to 20.</i>

35:17.398 --> 35:19.332
<i>I'm king of Alaska Mountain!</i>

35:19.400 --> 35:21.391
<i>He was the new prince
of Hollywood...</i>

35:21.469 --> 35:25.428
<i>Hollywood, California, that is.</i>

35:25.506 --> 35:28.236
Take a look around, Ronnie.
It's all yours.

35:28.309 --> 35:31.710
Terry, I don't believe it.
Man...

35:31.779 --> 35:35.681
If six months ago you would have said
that someday I, Ronnie Dobbs,

35:35.750 --> 35:38.310
would be eating
the world's biggest hotdog,

35:38.386 --> 35:41.878
I wouldn't have believed a goddamned
word out of your lying mouth.

35:43.090 --> 35:45.058
Only in Hollywood!

35:45.593 --> 35:49.723
That's not all. I have another surprise
for you, and you're gonna love it.

35:49.797 --> 35:51.389
There's a bigger hotdog?

35:51.465 --> 35:53.933
It's much better than that!

36:00.274 --> 36:02.105
Here we are, Ronnie!

36:03.110 --> 36:04.634
Hell.

36:07.915 --> 36:09.815
I don't like museums.

36:09.884 --> 36:11.818
No, it's a house.

36:11.886 --> 36:14.116
It's your house.

36:22.129 --> 36:27.089
It's glorious,
like an angel-sparkling loogie!

36:33.074 --> 36:35.338
- Damn!
- What is it?

36:35.409 --> 36:39.846
I like it and all, Terry, but it's gonna take
an awf ul long time to fuck it up.

36:39.914 --> 36:44.408
I did foresee that eventuality.
You won't be alone.

36:46.454 --> 36:50.584
Kyle, Tonya!
Fucked-up dog!

36:51.626 --> 36:53.116
Hey, man!
All right!

36:53.194 --> 36:55.685
Hey, Clay.
Man, I'm sorry about...

36:55.763 --> 36:59.563
That's all right, Ronnie.
It's kind of my fault anyway.

36:59.634 --> 37:03.070
Good part is, I don't have
no feeling below my chin.

37:03.137 --> 37:04.297
All right!

37:04.372 --> 37:07.068
Let's have us
a champagne jam!

37:11.379 --> 37:13.711
What are you doing,
you drunken cripple?

37:15.583 --> 37:17.175
Ronnie!
You're fabulous, man!

37:17.251 --> 37:19.344
I love your stuff, Ronnie.
Welcome to the club.

37:19.420 --> 37:21.411
- Show biz forever!
- Forever!

37:21.489 --> 37:22.888
Here's to you.

37:22.957 --> 37:24.891
Come on, dog,
eat that vomit.

37:24.959 --> 37:26.586
Eat it! Lick it!

37:26.661 --> 37:29.255
There he goes!
Look at him!

37:29.330 --> 37:31.093
Lick it up.
Good for his coat.

37:31.165 --> 37:32.996
- John Stamos.
- I'm Rebecca.

37:33.067 --> 37:35.058
Give him a kiss.
Give him a good one.

37:35.136 --> 37:37.263
That's Ronnie Dobbs.
Give him a little tongue.

37:37.338 --> 37:38.327
Okay!

37:38.406 --> 37:40.306
You've got to come over
and rob us sometime.

37:40.374 --> 37:42.808
- Will do, will do.
- We won't even call the police.

37:42.877 --> 37:45.675
- Nice mullet.
- Colin, man, what's up?

37:47.148 --> 37:48.479
Hey, buddy!

37:48.549 --> 37:50.779
Like always, man.
Thank you very much.

37:50.851 --> 37:52.716
Anytime.
Yo, Ronnie.

37:53.354 --> 37:56.152
- Okay. A'ight, man.
- You look in good shape, huh?

37:56.223 --> 37:58.418
Ronnie Dobbs!
What's up?

37:59.727 --> 38:01.718
Why weren't you at my party?

38:01.796 --> 38:05.493
That's okay. I'm gonna have
another one tonight... in my pants.

38:05.566 --> 38:07.193
- I'm just kidding!
- A'ight.

38:07.268 --> 38:09.668
- Am I? Of course I am...
- Okay.

38:09.737 --> 38:10.999
...not.

38:11.072 --> 38:13.472
- Big fan, big fan!
- A'ight, man.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.532
Ronnie Dobbs,
you are brilliant!

38:15.609 --> 38:18.601
<i>- You have to do me a favor.
- At your service.</i>

38:18.679 --> 38:20.271
Tell me to fuck off!

38:20.848 --> 38:22.679
Come on!
It's her birthday!

38:22.750 --> 38:24.911
A'ight.
Fuck you, bitch!

38:24.986 --> 38:27.079
Oh, my God.

38:27.154 --> 38:28.883
In fact, fuck all y'all!

38:30.191 --> 38:33.456
Man, like that?
Check this out!

38:40.801 --> 38:42.894
That one was for next year.

38:42.970 --> 38:43.959
Happy birthday.

38:44.038 --> 38:46.506
Ronnie, there you are.
Come along.

38:48.509 --> 38:50.977
Birthday girl,
you need a spanking.

38:51.045 --> 38:53.809
Someone very special
came here just to see you.

38:53.881 --> 38:55.940
His name's Chow-Chow,
and he's here on behalf

38:56.017 --> 38:58.144
of the Make-Your-Last-Wish
Foundation.

38:58.219 --> 38:59.379
Picture.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.979
Peyton!

39:06.861 --> 39:09.193
Chow-Chow, what's up?

39:09.263 --> 39:12.130
- I'm sad.
- Why's that?

39:12.199 --> 39:15.100
The doctor says I need
special shoes for my fat feet

39:15.169 --> 39:18.866
so I can be like a normal kid
and run and play!

39:18.939 --> 39:23.308
Kiddo, no more tears,
'cause Uncle Ronnie Dobbs is here.

39:23.377 --> 39:25.208
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

39:25.279 --> 39:28.305
I'm gonna go out in this world
and get everything I can get.

39:28.382 --> 39:30.942
I'm gonna be rich, super rich.

39:31.018 --> 39:34.784
I'm gonna be spending money
like a chimp in a beat-off contest.

39:34.855 --> 39:35.947
Yeah?

39:36.023 --> 39:37.786
- Don't interrupt me, now.
- So sorry.

39:37.858 --> 39:39.951
Then I'm gonna get
1,000 pair of special shoes,

39:40.027 --> 39:43.827
put 'em in a big ol' pile,
and just burn 'em all!

39:44.899 --> 39:46.958
- Mr. Ronnie!
- Don't interrupt me!

39:47.034 --> 39:49.468
- I done told you once.
- So sorry. No interrupt.

39:49.537 --> 39:52.529
I'm gonna get
a diamond crystal speedboat,

39:52.606 --> 39:56.235
and I'm gonna paint it gold,
and I'm gonna get so much pussy.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.301
But I ain't gonna leave you out.

39:58.379 --> 40:00.643
You gonna get some.
I'll get you laid.

40:00.714 --> 40:02.045
What kind you like?

40:02.583 --> 40:04.414
That's a tough one.
Don't answer yet.

40:04.485 --> 40:05.679
Save it. Okay.

40:05.753 --> 40:08.654
Then I'm gonna find the dude
what makes special shoes

40:08.722 --> 40:11.282
<i>and pay him not to make
special shoes!</i>

40:13.928 --> 40:16.089
How about that?
Damn, look at them!

40:19.633 --> 40:22.067
...I drew an arrow up
to where my bedroom's at.

40:23.070 --> 40:24.435
- Ronnie Dobbs.
- Yeah.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.166
- Scott Thompson.
- Okay.

40:26.240 --> 40:29.767
Man, I love your work!
Is it real, though?

40:29.844 --> 40:32.278
<i>Do you really get arrested?</i>

40:32.346 --> 40:33.643
Hell, yeah, bitch!

40:35.182 --> 40:37.446
This music is awf ul.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.782
Mind if I raid your CD cabinet?

40:39.854 --> 40:42.948
Raid my...
No, man.

40:43.023 --> 40:44.615
You want to...
no, man.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.751
My CD cabinet is "exit only."

40:47.361 --> 40:50.353
Thought you was gonna try
to turn me gay when I wasn't looking?

40:50.431 --> 40:53.730
I know all about y'all's
gay conspiracy agenda.

40:53.801 --> 40:56.429
- Please!
- Nice try.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.802
Lucky Pierre, this is Ramrod.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.241
<i>We have a breach of security.
He knows everything.</i>

41:03.310 --> 41:05.835
<i>Code re d.
I repeat... code red!</i>

41:13.854 --> 41:16.687
We just received
our numbers from overseas.

41:16.757 --> 41:18.418
Combined with our efforts here,

41:18.492 --> 41:21.154
everything is proceeding
precisely according to plan...

41:21.228 --> 41:24.925
gay bars are up,
straight men are experimenting,

41:24.999 --> 41:26.990
the priesthood
is still our number one...

41:27.067 --> 41:28.056
What?

41:32.740 --> 41:33.968
We got a leak.

41:34.041 --> 41:35.030
What?!

41:37.011 --> 41:39.002
We're gonna have to shut down

41:39.079 --> 41:43.243
this entire worldwide
multibillion-dollar gay conspiracy.

41:43.317 --> 41:45.410
What about the gay-dar machine?

41:45.486 --> 41:48.717
- And the $3 bill?
- What about the skin flute?

41:48.789 --> 41:51.257
Sorry, ladies.

41:51.325 --> 41:52.553
It's over.

41:53.961 --> 41:56.452
Tell our source to get
back into the closet, pronto.

41:58.532 --> 42:01.000
<i>- Damn it!
- Ramrod, code blue.</i>

42:01.068 --> 42:03.059
<i>Get back in the closet.
Repeat... code...</i>

42:06.640 --> 42:10.041
Ladies!
You both have beautiful posture.

42:10.110 --> 42:12.101
Could I get you a drink?

42:12.346 --> 42:13.608
What's up, Ronnie?

42:16.150 --> 42:20.052
Damn!
It's the cardboard beer girl!

42:42.276 --> 42:46.474
My name is Kayla.
I am so excited to meet you.

42:46.547 --> 42:48.742
I am such a huge fan of yours.

42:50.084 --> 42:54.885
My agent's been telling me
how hot you are... and I agree.

42:58.626 --> 43:02.255
I'm hot... hot for you,
if you know what I mean.

43:03.397 --> 43:05.058
I know what you mean.

43:05.132 --> 43:10.092
Tell me, is that a beer in your pocket,
or are you just happy to see me?

43:10.170 --> 43:12.161
No, I ain't got no beer.

43:13.707 --> 43:15.368
No, that's a hard-on.

43:15.442 --> 43:18.775
That's 'cause of you.
You gave that to me.

43:18.879 --> 43:25.580
Well, maybe your big dog
could train my naughty pussycat.

43:25.653 --> 43:30.249
Well, I ain't into pets
or nothing, so, nah.

43:30.324 --> 43:32.383
But I got a better idea.

43:32.459 --> 43:35.758
How' s about Dr. Ronnie
takes this here hard-on

43:35.829 --> 43:39.492
and writes you a prescription
for a hot beef injection?

43:40.200 --> 43:43.567
Maybe it's time
you showed me your bedroom.

43:44.805 --> 43:47.239
I could do that,
but I got a better idea.

43:47.308 --> 43:49.242
How' s about you and I go fu...

44:09.797 --> 44:11.264
<i>? Damn?</i>

44:22.142 --> 44:23.905

45:11.291 --> 45:14.727

45:21.368 --> 45:24.565

45:24.638 --> 45:26.401
<i>? To get you hot?</i>

45:26.473 --> 45:28.566
<i>? It's just a small confection?</i>

45:28.642 --> 45:32.408
<i>? To signify my affection?</i>

45:32.479 --> 45:34.071
<i>? How 'bout a collection?</i>

45:34.148 --> 45:37.015

45:44.858 --> 45:48.157

46:05.412 --> 46:09.439
<i>? It's gonna make

46:09.516 --> 46:11.882

46:13.620 --> 46:15.053

46:15.122 --> 46:16.384

47:03.537 --> 47:05.664

47:05.739 --> 47:09.197
<i>? This was the greatest love
in history?</i>

47:09.276 --> 47:12.268
<i>? A guarantee of depravery...?</i>

47:21.288 --> 47:24.280
Well, Ronnie,
you've bedded your dream girl.

47:27.361 --> 47:28.760
What is it?

47:31.965 --> 47:34.798
I don't know.
Terry, man, it's weird.

47:35.302 --> 47:38.396
She's hot and all,
you know, but it's weird.

47:38.472 --> 47:40.667
When I'm making
the sweetest of loves to her...

47:40.741 --> 47:43.073
doing it for real, you know?

47:43.143 --> 47:47.341
I'm loving on her, and I'm pulling out
in time and everything,

47:47.414 --> 47:49.746
and it's just like...

47:50.751 --> 47:53.652
I don't know.
I can't help but think of Tammy.

47:54.655 --> 47:56.987
Maybe I should see
a doctor or something.

47:59.493 --> 48:03.259
I'll give you a diagnosis for free.
You're in love.

48:07.067 --> 48:09.262
Since we're pouring
our hearts out to each other,

48:09.336 --> 48:11.429
I've got a little secret to share,

48:11.505 --> 48:14.474
something I've never shared
with anyone before.

48:14.541 --> 48:16.008
My accent...

48:17.344 --> 48:18.811
...it isn't real.

48:18.879 --> 48:20.403
You ain't from England?

48:21.481 --> 48:23.142
No, I'm from England,

48:23.216 --> 48:27.152
but I was born
without an accent.

48:32.292 --> 48:33.725
That's cool.

48:34.695 --> 48:36.925
I wonder if Tammy
would take me back.

48:38.265 --> 48:41.234
Man, get me a bus ticket
back home tomorrow.

48:41.301 --> 48:42.734
No, sir!

48:42.803 --> 48:44.930
You have a TV show to do.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.734
I'm gonna go back home.

48:46.807 --> 48:50.208
You're not going anywhere,
but I'll tell you what I will do.

48:50.277 --> 48:53.405
I'll get Tammy a bus ticket
to come out here!

48:53.480 --> 48:56.574
When she sees
what you've done... the house,

48:56.650 --> 49:00.780
the monster truck
in the garage, the beer girl...

49:03.123 --> 49:06.752
I mean, it'll only make her jealous,

49:06.827 --> 49:09.887
and that's the number one
motivation for women.

49:09.963 --> 49:11.260
Right.

49:11.331 --> 49:13.629
Right, man.
Jealousy.

49:14.635 --> 49:17.229
That's like women's kryptonite.

49:30.651 --> 49:31.982
Anybody home?

49:33.320 --> 49:35.049
<i>Enchant?</i>

49:35.122 --> 49:40.424
<i>Mach? Rie has arrived,
and your knight in finery awaits.</i>

49:40.494 --> 49:43.054
Ronnie, this place is amazing.

49:43.130 --> 49:46.998
Yes, my dear, and it is
a mere pittance of my vast estate,

49:47.067 --> 49:49.058
some of which
you can't even see.

49:49.136 --> 49:53.505
I got a bank account now,
and I'm wearing socks.

49:54.374 --> 49:58.538
Behold, glorious gifts
from God and above...

49:58.612 --> 50:03.481
a toilet paper rosette
for a true lady of the evening,

50:03.550 --> 50:08.146
and an Italian cottage
made of international cheeses.

50:09.156 --> 50:12.922
You can eat the whole thing,
except for the bottom. That's cardboard.

50:14.127 --> 50:15.458
I almost forgot.

50:15.529 --> 50:19.090
Let me introduce to you
my secret weapon.

50:25.672 --> 50:27.105
Who's she?

50:27.174 --> 50:29.039
Only the girl I been fucking.

50:31.511 --> 50:33.172
Jealous much?

50:38.585 --> 50:40.212
Way to go, bitch.
You fucked up.

52:05.472 --> 52:06.564
Hey, bro.

52:06.640 --> 52:10.804
You look like you could use something
to make you feel a whole lot better.

52:12.145 --> 52:13.737
Come inside, man.

52:13.814 --> 52:14.803
It's okay.

52:19.719 --> 52:21.414
<i>And newly elected governor
Hark Trellis</i>

52:21.488 --> 52:23.251
<i>is making national news</i>

52:23.323 --> 52:26.417
<i>with a record number of executions

52:26.493 --> 52:28.927
<i>So far, 35 thrilled prisoners...</i>

52:28.995 --> 52:31.259
<i>Sorry, the word is "doomed."</i>

52:31.331 --> 52:34.926
<i>Make that doomed prisoners
excitedly skipped towards death row.</i>

52:35.001 --> 52:36.866
<i>No, they didn't.
They were led.</i>

52:36.937 --> 52:40.202
<i>What the hell are we paying
Malaysians 35 cents a T-shirt for</i>

52:40.273 --> 52:44.175
<i>when we can get them

52:44.244 --> 52:47.008
<i>Time magazine is accusing you
of exploiting Ronnie!</i>

52:47.080 --> 52:50.311
Great! More publicity
for my musical!

52:53.453 --> 52:54.977
Come on!

52:55.889 --> 52:57.186
I want to hear this!

52:57.257 --> 53:04.322
? I thought that my home
was my castle?

53:04.965 --> 53:10.699
? With no one scrutinizing me?

53:11.972 --> 53:15.237
? No pigs, no lyin' bitch?

53:15.308 --> 53:18.277
? No hassle?

53:19.279 --> 53:24.478
? Y'all are brutalizin' me?

53:25.485 --> 53:27.749
? Can't a man?

53:27.821 --> 53:33.054
? Not drink his beer in silence??

53:33.126 --> 53:35.253
? Can't a man?

53:35.328 --> 53:40.356
? Not crudely lie and scream??

53:40.433 --> 53:42.230
? Can't a man?

53:42.302 --> 53:47.262
? Not control his bitch
with violence??

53:48.942 --> 53:56.610
? Y'all are brutalizin' me?

53:57.784 --> 54:00.014
? Y'all?

54:00.086 --> 54:05.854
? Are brutalizing?

54:05.926 --> 54:15.665
? Me?

54:15.735 --> 54:20.866
No, no, no!
That was shite, pure shite!

54:22.142 --> 54:25.543
- I don't disagree.
- Really?

54:25.612 --> 54:27.978
I think it's ridiculous like this.

54:28.048 --> 54:32.075
It's like a lie, and we've spent
the whole play getting to this point.

54:32.152 --> 54:34.484
We've unpeeled the onion.
He should be naked.

54:34.554 --> 54:36.715
It's a naked,
beautiful moment.

54:36.790 --> 54:38.257
Let's try it your way.

54:38.325 --> 54:40.691
- Please.
- Mr. Twillstein.

54:40.760 --> 54:42.694
- It's about Ronnie.
- What about Ronnie?

54:42.762 --> 54:44.992
He can't get arrested.

54:46.199 --> 54:48.258
Get me on the next flight out.

54:50.603 --> 54:52.696
My golden goose.

54:52.772 --> 54:54.763
Okay, take it from the beginning.

54:55.442 --> 54:57.706
? Can't a man?

54:57.777 --> 55:00.974
? Not drink his beer in silence??

55:03.782 --> 55:07.548
It's hard to say what you want

55:07.619 --> 55:09.883
without putting up
those old masks

55:09.955 --> 55:12.219
of "I'm not good enough,"

55:12.290 --> 55:15.225
or "I couldn't possibly obtain this."

55:16.361 --> 55:19.728
Complete this sentence...
"I want...

55:19.798 --> 55:22.028
"I want...

55:22.100 --> 55:27.936
In my fondest moments
of wantonness, I want..."

55:31.443 --> 55:34.139
Mary Lynn.
What does Mary Lynn want?

55:34.946 --> 55:36.937
I want a magenta horse.

55:38.784 --> 55:41.014
And I want to fly away with it

55:41.086 --> 55:43.350
into a reddish background,

55:43.421 --> 55:46.185
and I want pixies.

55:46.258 --> 55:47.850
I want pixies!

55:47.926 --> 55:51.362
Good.
Those are all doable.

55:51.429 --> 55:52.521
Good.

55:53.598 --> 55:56.829
Jim. What does Jim want?

55:56.902 --> 56:02.534
I want to write a hemp cookbook
using hemp ink,

56:02.607 --> 56:07.442
and I want to build houses
out of hemp for the homeless,

56:07.512 --> 56:13.382
and I want to make clothes
out of hemp for the world,

56:13.451 --> 56:16.443
and I just...

56:16.521 --> 56:20.116
It's okay. I know it's hard, Jim.
Say it. You're among friends.

56:21.159 --> 56:23.457
I want to smoke
some of the hemp.

56:24.629 --> 56:26.119
Just a little. Just...

56:27.632 --> 56:28.929
...a little.

56:30.001 --> 56:32.026
Good.
Getting more honest.

56:32.103 --> 56:33.968
Yeah.

56:34.039 --> 56:36.371
Jeff Goldblum.

56:36.441 --> 56:39.672
What does
Jeff Goldblum want?

56:39.744 --> 56:42.611
I want my money back.

56:46.218 --> 56:52.088
And I want angels
to give it to me.

56:53.625 --> 56:56.389
And pixies

56:56.461 --> 57:00.557
to count it out for me,

57:00.632 --> 57:04.227
and a gnome or a hobbit

57:04.302 --> 57:08.568
or an elf to sleep
at the foot of my bed,

57:08.640 --> 57:12.201
and have... I just want them
all over my backyard.

57:12.277 --> 57:15.838
No matter what happens with any
of that, I do want my money back.

57:17.649 --> 57:19.708
Ronnie Dobbs.

57:19.784 --> 57:22.412
Our newest recruit.
Thank you, Greg.

57:23.455 --> 57:27.323
What does Ronnie want?

57:28.927 --> 57:30.588
I think I got it.

57:32.597 --> 57:35.430
I want to love people,

57:35.500 --> 57:38.230
and I want people
to love on me.

57:39.404 --> 57:40.769
And I want...

57:41.773 --> 57:43.331
...pecan pie.

57:43.408 --> 57:45.399
I want angels
to make me that pie.

57:45.477 --> 57:47.468
I want angels
to make me that pie so good!

57:47.545 --> 57:52.642
And I want whipped cream
and straw berries on top!

58:02.694 --> 58:04.423
<i>I'll tell you what I want.</i>

58:04.496 --> 58:07.329
Terry! I thought
you was in New York.

58:07.399 --> 58:10.630
A lot of people
think a lot of things about New York.

58:10.702 --> 58:13.933
- I want...
- He didn't pay.

58:14.005 --> 58:17.668
<i>It's $1,500
to say what you want.</i>

58:17.742 --> 58:20.108
Stuff it!
I want the old Ronnie back!

58:20.178 --> 58:22.840
Tonya and Kyle told me
you've become a vegetarian,

58:22.914 --> 58:24.973
and you haven't
drank with them in weeks.

58:25.050 --> 58:29.111
Hey, Tonya, Kyle,
fucked-up dog.

58:29.187 --> 58:32.156
Hey, Clay.
Sorry 'bout that spinal thing.

58:32.223 --> 58:34.350
<i>It's okay, Ronnie.</i>

58:34.426 --> 58:36.656
<i>I was drunk, too.</i>

58:36.728 --> 58:38.889
Have you read
these letters I'm getting?

58:38.964 --> 58:41.432
"Dear Ronnie,
my name is Maurice.

58:41.499 --> 58:44.093
"I am eight years old.
I am your biggest fan.

58:44.169 --> 58:46.694
"How come you are
not so drunk anymore?

58:46.771 --> 58:50.764
"My daddy says you were never
really drunk, just a Hollywood phony!

58:50.842 --> 58:53.470
I told him he was wrong.
He beat the shit out of me."

58:53.545 --> 58:56.036
I've got sacks of these
back at my office!

58:56.114 --> 58:57.843
Terry, man, it's hard!

58:57.916 --> 59:00.510
You don't know what it's like
being a superstar!

59:00.585 --> 59:04.851
You get all these people going,
"What can I do for you, Mr. Dobbs?"

59:04.923 --> 59:07.289
You've got to think of things
they've got to do.

59:07.359 --> 59:09.122
You just don't know.
It's hard.

59:09.194 --> 59:10.456
Here. Have a drink.

59:10.528 --> 59:12.792
- It's no fun anymore.
- I know, I know.

59:12.864 --> 59:14.695
Take a break, there.

59:16.601 --> 59:18.296
Everybody's giving you free...

59:18.370 --> 59:21.396
A little bit more.
Drink, drink, drink.

59:25.710 --> 59:26.836
A little bit more.

59:30.749 --> 59:32.910
I got my beer goggles on now!

59:32.984 --> 59:36.249
That's right!
I'm starting to see clearly.

59:36.321 --> 59:38.186
This does smell like bullshit.

59:38.256 --> 59:40.656
Y'all get out of my house.
Get on out of here!

59:40.725 --> 59:43.751
Freaky new wave hippie!
Get out of here, blondie!

59:43.828 --> 59:46.922
You, too, Jeff Goldenstein!
Go on! Get going!

59:46.998 --> 59:50.263
Yeah! 'cause old
Ronnie Dobbs is back!

59:54.239 --> 59:56.571
Oh, Ronnie,
I love you!

01:00:00.979 --> 01:00:02.640
Hello.
It's me again.

01:00:02.714 --> 01:00:05.205
<i>The scene you were
about to see has been cut</i>

01:00:05.283 --> 01:00:09.344
so the film you're watching could obtain
the rating mandated by the studio.

01:00:09.421 --> 01:00:14.290
It's a shame, as it was a beautifully shot
and poignant scene of love...

01:00:14.359 --> 01:00:16.623
a thing of the past, I suppose.

01:00:16.694 --> 01:00:19.060
Many famous films
have had scenes cut

01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:21.564
to reach a specified audience.

01:00:21.633 --> 01:00:24.693
Here's a scene cut
from a popular children's film.

01:00:29.441 --> 01:00:32.933
? There are several ways
to irritate a lady?

01:00:33.478 --> 01:00:36.572
? You could mention
that her hat's gone out of style?

01:00:36.648 --> 01:00:38.445
? That's sure to get her miffed?

01:00:38.516 --> 01:00:40.450
? It's bound to cause a tiff?

01:00:40.518 --> 01:00:46.423
? But here's a little trick
to go the extra mile?

01:00:47.058 --> 01:00:49.492
? Give her?

01:00:49.561 --> 01:00:52.257
? Just a little kick in the cunt?

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:54.423
A kick in the cunt?

01:00:54.499 --> 01:00:56.296
? A kick in the cunt?

01:00:56.367 --> 01:00:59.461
? How' s about
a nice kick in the cunt??

01:01:00.238 --> 01:01:03.639
? You'll sure have her stumped
if you go for the punt?

01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:06.677
? With a jolly good
kick in the cunt?

01:01:07.178 --> 01:01:09.510
? Now, you might want to sock her
a clop in the choppers?

01:01:09.581 --> 01:01:11.208
? Or shock her by making
a grab at her knockers?

01:01:11.282 --> 01:01:13.045
? But she'll call the coppers
and you'll land in jail?

01:01:13.118 --> 01:01:14.949
? Where you eat bread and water
and shit in a pail?

01:01:15.019 --> 01:01:16.646
? So if you've enough
of her womanly guff?

01:01:16.721 --> 01:01:18.416
? No need to be rough...
it'll be quite enough?

01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:20.287
? To call her bluff
with a huff and a puff?

01:01:20.358 --> 01:01:23.122
? Just stuff your foot
straight into her muff?

01:01:24.195 --> 01:01:27.164
I'm sorry. That was
an inappropriate scene to showhere,

01:01:27.232 --> 01:01:29.666
as it was cut for time,
not content.

01:01:29.734 --> 01:01:32.168
Let's rejoin the film
you've been watching.

01:01:32.237 --> 01:01:34.762
<i>Ronnie returned
to his home town a hero.</i>

01:01:38.042 --> 01:01:41.170
Come on, Ronnie,
aren't you excited?

01:01:41.246 --> 01:01:42.406
I guess.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:46.473
I was just kind of expecting Tammy
to come down and see me, that's all.

01:01:48.553 --> 01:01:49.645
Thank you.

01:01:49.721 --> 01:01:52.519
Thank you.
A'ight, come on, now.

01:01:57.595 --> 01:02:00.587
I'd like to thank Mr. Dobbs
for farting the alphabet.

01:02:00.665 --> 01:02:02.929
He's definitely a man
of many talents.

01:02:03.001 --> 01:02:04.434
Now, here of course...

01:02:04.502 --> 01:02:06.402
Okay, P.S.

01:02:06.471 --> 01:02:08.200
I just want to say, okay,

01:02:08.273 --> 01:02:11.538
<i>some of y'all think
that I don't deserve a second chance,</i>

01:02:11.609 --> 01:02:14.703
and I swear,
if I were to get a second chance

01:02:14.779 --> 01:02:17.213
or even a fourth chance,

01:02:17.282 --> 01:02:20.217
I would make a good husband
to these people.

01:02:20.285 --> 01:02:22.549
That's God's honest truth.

01:02:29.561 --> 01:02:31.961
Baby, you see me farting?

01:02:32.997 --> 01:02:35.158
Arrest this piece of shit, boys.

01:02:35.233 --> 01:02:36.632
What the hell?

01:02:36.701 --> 01:02:38.498
You're going down
for good this time.

01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:40.265
He didn't do nothing.

01:02:40.338 --> 01:02:42.704
That's really true this time.

01:02:42.774 --> 01:02:47.040
It's my new policy, a little thing
I like to call "no strikes and you're out."

01:02:47.979 --> 01:02:49.310
You can't do that!

01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:51.814
Governor, please,
Ronnie's a celebrity now.

01:02:51.883 --> 01:02:54.010
Don't you make
an exception for them?

01:02:54.085 --> 01:02:56.645
We had a deal, Twillstein.

01:02:56.721 --> 01:02:58.780
I want to file a reward!

01:02:58.856 --> 01:03:00.153
Make a hole.

01:03:00.225 --> 01:03:03.422
Y'all seen that! Do something!
Don't just stand there!

01:03:12.804 --> 01:03:14.931
Man, what's up?

01:03:15.006 --> 01:03:16.769
I can't hear you.

01:03:16.841 --> 01:03:20.004
Yes, Ronnie. The phone.
Pick up the phone.

01:03:20.078 --> 01:03:21.773
The phone!

01:03:21.846 --> 01:03:23.177
Pick up the phone!

01:03:23.248 --> 01:03:24.738
Hang on.

01:03:24.816 --> 01:03:25.942
Yeah-lo?

01:03:26.017 --> 01:03:27.450
Ronnie, it's Terry.

01:03:27.518 --> 01:03:29.076
Hang on.
He's right here.

01:03:29.153 --> 01:03:30.882
Man, it's for you.

01:03:30.955 --> 01:03:31.944
No.

01:03:32.023 --> 01:03:35.720
No, it's me on the phone.
I'm on the phone!

01:03:36.728 --> 01:03:38.127
Okay.

01:03:38.196 --> 01:03:40.858
It looks like he's on another call.
Can you call back?

01:03:40.932 --> 01:03:45.869
Ronnie, it's me, Terry,
speaking to you via the telephone.

01:03:45.937 --> 01:03:47.302
Oh, man!

01:03:48.973 --> 01:03:51.134
Okay, I got it now.

01:03:51.209 --> 01:03:54.610
Man, how are you?
You know you've got a phone call?

01:03:54.679 --> 01:03:56.806
Yes, I realize that.

01:03:56.881 --> 01:03:58.974
<i>Ronnie, how are you?</i>

01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:01.644
I'm good.
I can't complain, man.

01:04:01.719 --> 01:04:03.914
Check out the threads. Free.

01:04:04.622 --> 01:04:07.648
You know, Ronnie,
this is all my fault.

01:04:07.725 --> 01:04:10.751
I was so busy
exploiting you that...

01:04:10.828 --> 01:04:12.295
Yeah. Hang on.
That's cool.

01:04:12.363 --> 01:04:15.696
They asked me if I wanted
to get electrocuted or injected.

01:04:15.767 --> 01:04:17.701
I was like,
"Wait a minute.

01:04:17.769 --> 01:04:20.602
"What say I jump out
of an airplane what's on fire,

01:04:20.672 --> 01:04:24.108
"no parachute,
but straight into a shark tank

01:04:24.175 --> 01:04:27.508
filled with poisonous razorblades?"

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.542
That's crazy talk!

01:04:30.615 --> 01:04:32.981
You're not jumping
out of any fiery airplane

01:04:33.051 --> 01:04:35.383
into a shark tank of razors!

01:04:35.453 --> 01:04:38.047
I know.
They said I had to get electrocuted.

01:04:38.122 --> 01:04:39.783
What are you talking about?

01:04:39.857 --> 01:04:42.348
I'm on death row.
Didn't you hear?

01:04:42.427 --> 01:04:45.157
Part of the governor's
new Get-Tough campaign.

01:04:45.229 --> 01:04:47.561
He's finally cleaning this state up.

01:04:47.632 --> 01:04:49.532
That can't be.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.534
They gonna kill me tomorrow.

01:04:51.602 --> 01:04:53.126
Let's go, Dobbs.

01:04:53.204 --> 01:04:55.229
I'll see you in hell, Terry.

01:04:56.107 --> 01:04:58.871
Do something real bad
so I can see you in hell, okay?

01:05:09.821 --> 01:05:11.049
Ronnie Dobbs.

01:05:12.523 --> 01:05:14.423
Naive bumpkin.

01:05:15.126 --> 01:05:16.491
What'd you call me?

01:05:16.561 --> 01:05:19.121
Sack of manure for brains.

01:05:21.566 --> 01:05:24.034
<i>We regrettably
interrupt Fishin' with Guns</i>

01:05:24.102 --> 01:05:25.933
<i>with this special news bulletin.</i>

01:05:26.003 --> 01:05:27.527
<i>Good evening.</i>

01:05:27.605 --> 01:05:28.970
<i>We have confirmed reports</i>

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.134
<i>that the son of governor Hark Trellis
has been kidnapped.</i>

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:35.077
<i>The kidnappers have demanded
the immediate turnover...</i>

01:05:35.146 --> 01:05:38.274
<i>- Inbred baboon.
- Of TV superstar Ronnie Dobbs.</i>

01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:39.373
<i>We now go live...</i>

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:41.918
- That's it!
- Shut up, you illiterate butterbean!

01:05:41.986 --> 01:05:44.682
Get him out of here!
Out the door, through the window!

01:05:44.756 --> 01:05:46.690
Get him out of here!

01:05:46.758 --> 01:05:50.524
Unhand me, hairy hillfolk.
I'm trying to watch this!

01:05:50.595 --> 01:05:54.554
<i>The lucky boy...
sorry, the unlucky boy...</i>

01:05:54.632 --> 01:05:58.090
<i>is being held hostage
by approximately four gentlemen.</i>

01:05:58.169 --> 01:05:59.227
Gentlemen?!

01:05:59.303 --> 01:06:02.238
No! Try "terrorists"!
Stupid tongue. Sorry.

01:06:02.306 --> 01:06:04.740
Four terrorists
who are demanding the release

01:06:04.809 --> 01:06:08.040
of a prisoner named Ronnie Dobbs
from Georgia's death row,

01:06:08.112 --> 01:06:10.307
a swank, luxurious
place of enchantment...

01:06:10.381 --> 01:06:12.076
What did I just say?

01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:15.347
This tongue of mine,
it's all twisted up!

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:16.910
<i>... make a de al.</i>

01:06:16.988 --> 01:06:19.479
<i>You hear me?
We will make a deal.</i>

01:06:21.025 --> 01:06:23.016
<i>Real simple.</i>

01:06:26.731 --> 01:06:30.724
<i>Real simple.
There 's no need for violence.</i>

01:06:30.802 --> 01:06:32.861
I want you to stay calm.

01:06:32.937 --> 01:06:34.666
This can be worked out.

01:06:36.908 --> 01:06:40.901
All right in there, listen up.
This is the governor talking to you.

01:06:40.978 --> 01:06:42.809
I heard your demands.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.542
Now I want to tell you
my demands.

01:06:46.083 --> 01:06:50.019
Let my son go
and shoot yourselves in the head!

01:06:50.087 --> 01:06:51.850
How' s that sit with you?

01:06:51.923 --> 01:06:56.292
I didn't get a nickname like "Get Tough"
by caring about my son!

01:06:58.629 --> 01:07:00.028
- Give me that.
- Twillstein!

01:07:00.097 --> 01:07:02.861
Don't listen to him!
He's not on your side!

01:07:02.934 --> 01:07:04.834
You can do
whatever you can dream!

01:07:04.902 --> 01:07:06.699
Twillstein!
Get him!

01:07:13.611 --> 01:07:16.705
We ain't makin'
no deals here, pal.

01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:18.749
I'm not with the bobbies.

01:07:18.816 --> 01:07:21.182
No, I've come here to assist you.

01:07:21.853 --> 01:07:24.879
Look, I realize
that you're fans of Ronnie's,

01:07:24.956 --> 01:07:28.687
and you want to get him out and get
an autograph and maybe a photo,

01:07:28.759 --> 01:07:31.284
but when you're done,
I'll take him.

01:07:31.362 --> 01:07:35.458
You ain't taking him now here!
He's staying right here.

01:07:35.533 --> 01:07:38.400
We got special plans for Dobbs.

01:07:38.469 --> 01:07:40.528
That's wonderful.
What could they be?

01:07:40.605 --> 01:07:43.733
We're gonna kill
the son of a bitch!

01:07:43.808 --> 01:07:45.742
Kill Ronnie?

01:07:47.311 --> 01:07:49.745
Why would you want
to do that?

01:07:57.889 --> 01:08:00.357
<i>You're from
that Elimination program.</i>

01:08:00.424 --> 01:08:01.857
You got that right.

01:08:01.926 --> 01:08:04.292
We was shittin' in high cotton.

01:08:04.362 --> 01:08:07.763
We had the number one show,
then when Dobbs showed up,

01:08:07.832 --> 01:08:10.266
network pulled the plug
on our show!

01:08:10.334 --> 01:08:13.269
Yeah!
They forgot all about us!

01:08:13.337 --> 01:08:16.795
Hell, they left us out there
on that goddamned island to die!

01:08:16.874 --> 01:08:20.810
We had to make a goddamned canoe
out of the fat guy!

01:08:20.877 --> 01:08:23.471
But he's on death row.
Isn't that enough?

01:08:23.548 --> 01:08:26.608
No, that ain't enough!
We gonna kill him our way!

01:08:26.684 --> 01:08:29.551
And then we're gonna eat him.

01:08:30.654 --> 01:08:34.283
What in the hell do you think
I'm talking about here, pinhead?

01:08:48.538 --> 01:08:51.234
Man, this is hard.

01:08:51.309 --> 01:08:54.971
You live your whole life,
you think you've got it all worked out,

01:08:55.046 --> 01:08:57.810
and then comes
the toughest choice of all.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.993
I hope I'm doing the right thing.

01:09:25.876 --> 01:09:27.969
Dobbs, you got more visitors.

01:09:28.045 --> 01:09:30.069
Hey, little beans!

01:09:30.147 --> 01:09:32.774
Gonna give you a few minutes
to say good-bye.

01:09:33.517 --> 01:09:36.782
Right on!
Look at y'all.

01:09:36.854 --> 01:09:39.687
You guys run along
and let me talk to Daddy, okay?

01:09:45.796 --> 01:09:46.990
Sorry.

01:09:47.064 --> 01:09:48.361
Do those hurt?

01:09:49.265 --> 01:09:50.665
They a'ight.

01:09:52.837 --> 01:09:54.464
Tammy, I love you so much.

01:09:54.538 --> 01:09:57.200
I mean...
You're the only one I ever loved.

01:09:57.274 --> 01:09:59.435
I don't know what happened.

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:00.943
Ronwell...

01:10:01.012 --> 01:10:05.278
sometimes God shines
His magic light beam from outer space,

01:10:05.349 --> 01:10:07.579
and it works in mysterious ways.

01:10:08.686 --> 01:10:11.120
I may not always know
what He's thinking,

01:10:11.188 --> 01:10:13.679
but I know that inside,
you're a good man.

01:10:14.225 --> 01:10:17.683
Oh, baby.
I wish I had a magic genie bottle.

01:10:17.762 --> 01:10:20.959
I'd rub it so hard that genie'd be like,
"What the fuck you doin'?"

01:10:21.032 --> 01:10:24.024
I'd be like,
"I need some wishes bad!"

01:10:24.101 --> 01:10:27.662
That genie'd be like, "You keep rubbin'
my bottle-home so hard,

01:10:27.738 --> 01:10:31.139
I'll give you a foot-shaped wish
up your ass," and I'll be like...

01:10:34.545 --> 01:10:36.342
Okay, let's go.
Time's up.

01:10:36.414 --> 01:10:37.711
Let's go.

01:10:38.749 --> 01:10:40.410
What the hell?

01:11:00.204 --> 01:11:03.173
<i>Let's kill the kid and the sissy.</i>

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.003
<i>I'm starvin'.</i>

01:11:05.076 --> 01:11:07.544
I'd like a snack, too.

01:11:16.754 --> 01:11:18.745
Sorry we have to do this, kid...

01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:25.686
...but your daddy,
he is one tough bastard.

01:11:25.763 --> 01:11:27.526
Like father...

01:11:29.967 --> 01:11:31.025
...like son.

01:11:43.481 --> 01:11:44.641
Come on!

01:11:44.715 --> 01:11:46.580
Hut!

01:11:54.825 --> 01:11:55.814
Who's next?

01:12:10.908 --> 01:12:12.000
Fat little prick!

01:12:56.086 --> 01:12:58.953
United States Marine Corps taught me
how to kill a man in six seconds

01:12:59.023 --> 01:13:00.547
before they kicked me out.

01:13:00.624 --> 01:13:02.387
Let's get it on, sweetheart.

01:13:47.104 --> 01:13:48.935
Son!

01:13:53.677 --> 01:13:55.770
I got some demands of my own.

01:13:56.313 --> 01:13:58.975
<i>It's confirmed. Governor's approved
the pardoon of prisoner Dobbs.</i>

01:13:59.049 --> 01:14:00.311
<i>10-4.
Open the perimeter gate.</i>

01:14:00.384 --> 01:14:01.874
Where are we going?

01:14:01.952 --> 01:14:04.352
I didn't get my last meal!
What about my waffles?

01:14:04.421 --> 01:14:06.412
I was supposed to have
a wonderful breakfast

01:14:06.490 --> 01:14:09.755
of delicious waffles,
and I didn't get nothing,

01:14:09.827 --> 01:14:11.761
not even a bowl
of good-bye mints!

01:14:11.829 --> 01:14:13.262
What about my waffles?

01:14:13.330 --> 01:14:16.891
You mind if I buy you
those waffles, stranger?

01:14:16.967 --> 01:14:20.562
Nah, man, I ain't in...
Terry?

01:14:20.638 --> 01:14:23.436
What are you doing
picking up guys out here?

01:14:23.507 --> 01:14:26.032
I'm only here
to pick up one man.

01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:28.772
Fuck that guy.
Give me a ride.

01:14:38.889 --> 01:14:41.915
Come on, Ronnie.
Hollywood awaits.

01:14:41.992 --> 01:14:45.951
<i>Ronnie was in what the scholars
call a real shit pickle,</i>

01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:49.124
<i>but we know two heads
is always better than one,</i>

01:14:49.199 --> 01:14:51.793
<i>so Ronnie, Tammy, and Terry</i>

01:14:51.869 --> 01:14:55.134
<i>came up with some thing
that would make 'em all happy.</i>

01:15:04.882 --> 01:15:06.975
Look at me!
I'm on a river!

01:15:07.051 --> 01:15:09.349
Riverdance!

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:13.686
This is the greatest day
in the moment of American history!

01:15:13.757 --> 01:15:14.985
Ever!

01:15:15.059 --> 01:15:17.186
I'm Ronnie Dobbs!

01:15:18.362 --> 01:15:19.693
Catch the ring!

01:15:19.763 --> 01:15:21.196
<i>You catch the ring!</i>

01:15:21.265 --> 01:15:23.426
I'm not going, motherfucker!

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.832
We're trying to save your life!

01:15:28.105 --> 01:15:30.300
That's it, chum!

01:15:30.374 --> 01:15:32.968
Terry, did you see that?

01:15:33.043 --> 01:15:36.410
I drove backwards
right off the thing, man!

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.879
It was awesome!

01:15:37.948 --> 01:15:38.015
<i>A drunken Ronnie remained
in the water for six hours</i>

01:15:38.015 --> 01:15:40.279
<i>A drunken Ronnie remained
in the water for six hours</i>

01:15:40.351 --> 01:15:44.048
<i>before a crew of Navy SEALs
forcibly rescued him.</i>

01:15:44.121 --> 01:15:46.385
<i>We'll see that tonight,</i>

01:15:46.457 --> 01:15:48.891
<i>as well as Ronnie repelling rescuers</i>

01:15:48.959 --> 01:15:50.790
<i>from a treacherous cliff top.</i>

01:15:50.861 --> 01:15:53.557
<i>Bring on that "heliocopter."
I don't need you.</i>

01:15:53.630 --> 01:15:55.359
<i>Get on out of here.</i>

01:15:56.367 --> 01:16:00.497
<i>Then later,
in an alpine skiing tragedy,</i>

01:16:00.571 --> 01:16:04.405
<i>Ronnie comes perilously close
to dying of frostbite</i>

01:16:04.475 --> 01:16:08.070
<i>and humiliates a rescue team
with snowballs,</i>

01:16:08.145 --> 01:16:12.081
<i>all tonight on
Ronnie Dobbs Gets Rescued.</i>

01:16:14.418 --> 01:16:15.680
Cut!

01:16:15.753 --> 01:16:18.187
Brilliant! That's a wrap!

01:16:18.255 --> 01:16:21.019
You make Bob Stack
look like an amateur, Kent.

01:16:21.091 --> 01:16:24.026
100!
Who likes cake?

01:16:24.094 --> 01:16:25.686
Everybody.

01:16:25.763 --> 01:16:27.594
Yes. That's right.

01:16:28.766 --> 01:16:30.028
Where's Ronnie?

01:16:35.606 --> 01:16:37.836
Looks like you got
your truck lowered.

01:16:37.908 --> 01:16:40.843
Tammy, is that you?
You look glamorous!

01:16:40.911 --> 01:16:43.004
I'm a regular
Hollywood trophy wife.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.675
You are. Thank you
for loaning me your husband.

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:50.049
As long as he's not getting arrested,
it's okay by me.

01:16:51.288 --> 01:16:53.586
I feel like I'm ready to party!

01:16:53.657 --> 01:16:55.955
I got lungs of steel!

01:16:56.026 --> 01:16:58.494
A'ight, Clay, I heard that!

01:16:58.562 --> 01:17:00.120
Uncle! Uncle!

01:17:00.197 --> 01:17:01.528
Hey, little dude.

01:17:01.598 --> 01:17:04.328
You'll never guess.
I got my special shoes!

01:17:04.401 --> 01:17:05.891
I don't give a goddamn.

01:17:05.969 --> 01:17:07.197
Come on, Chow-Chow.

01:17:07.271 --> 01:17:10.104
Come on, y'all,
let's have us a champagne jam!

01:17:10.174 --> 01:17:11.539
Champagne!

01:17:11.608 --> 01:17:15.203
Let's party, for real this time!

01:17:15.279 --> 01:17:17.679
We're off, everybody.

01:17:22.019 --> 01:17:24.180
Ronnie, you ain't got
a hair on your ass

01:17:24.254 --> 01:17:26.245
if you don't give it some gas!

01:17:27.291 --> 01:17:28.724
Look out.

01:17:30.294 --> 01:17:33.559
Too fast, Uncle!
Uncle Ronnie, too fast!

01:17:36.633 --> 01:17:38.726
Look out!

01:17:43.874 --> 01:17:46.604
- That was a nasty right turn!
- You guys okay?

01:17:46.677 --> 01:17:48.076
Y'all all right?

01:17:48.145 --> 01:17:52.138
Uncle Ronnie,
you broke my special shoes!

01:18:02.493 --> 01:18:04.859
Then he stole some tires.

01:18:04.928 --> 01:18:07.362
He stole...

01:18:10.467 --> 01:18:12.958
Shouldn't he be
coming up by now?

01:18:15.172 --> 01:18:17.640
Go!

01:18:27.951 --> 01:18:30.943
This goat ate my shoes
and my shirt and my wallet

01:18:31.021 --> 01:18:33.353
and my diamond rings and...

01:18:37.694 --> 01:18:39.924
Goddamnit!

01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:49.234
Really? That's fabulous!

01:19:04.121 --> 01:19:07.056
Where's that ambulance at?

01:19:07.124 --> 01:19:10.287
Can't catch me!

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:14.660
Fuck! Jesus Christ!
Fuck! Troy!

01:19:25.275 --> 01:19:28.335
She's a lying bitch, officer.
You can't trust a word she's saying.

01:19:28.412 --> 01:19:30.277
Look at this stupid bitch!

01:19:31.682 --> 01:19:34.116
Get her off of me!
She's an old lady!

01:19:34.184 --> 01:19:35.583
What's wrong with you?

01:19:37.521 --> 01:19:38.886
Let me go!

01:19:38.956 --> 01:19:41.288
I want her fired.
I want her off the set.

01:19:52.903 --> 01:19:54.768
<i>It's called acting.</i>

01:23:39.696 --> 01:23:44.156
<i>Well, there you have it...
the Ronnie Dobbs story,</i>

01:23:44.234 --> 01:23:49.035
<i>from the bottom to the top
to the bottom and then back to the top.</i>

01:23:49.105 --> 01:23:51.573
<i>Who wants to bet
the bottom's next?</i>

01:23:51.641 --> 01:23:54.508
<i>What a story!
What about me?</i>

01:23:54.578 --> 01:23:57.979
<i>Well, look at me.
I'm fine.</i>

01:23:59.916 --> 01:24:01.713
<i>Now, that hit the spot.</i>

01:24:01.785 --> 01:24:04.117
<i>Anyway, I don't blame Ronnie.</i>

01:24:04.187 --> 01:24:07.281
<i>See, I was a little bit drunk
my own self.</i>

01:24:07.357 --> 01:24:09.348
<i>Live and learn, I guess.</i>

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:14.494
<i>I'm so tired,
but, hell, I can't go to sleep.</i>

01:24:14.564 --> 01:24:18.432
<i>Well, I guess
I'll just tell the story again.</i>

01:24:18.502 --> 01:24:23.064
<i>This here is the story
of one Ronwell Dobbs...</i>

01:25:18.502 --> 01:25:23.064
<i>Ripped by moksmid</i>
