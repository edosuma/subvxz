ISN'T SO MUCH THE CRAB.

14:07.533 --> 14:10.367
IT'S THESE GUYS SAFELY
STACKING THIS POT.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.867
THE WEATHER IS JUST
GETTING REALLY BAD,

14:14.900 --> 14:18.367

WORSE BY THE HOUR.

WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE BIT
OF A LATE START

15:53.467 --> 15:55.800
BECAUSE WE HAD TO FISH COD,

15:55.833 --> 15:59.633
SO, YOU KNOW,
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IT.

15:59.667 --> 16:05.200
HOPEFULLY, WE CAN FIND SOME
FRESH GROUND AND GO FROM THERE.

16:05.233 --> 16:07.333

WITH DOWN QUOTA, THIS YEAR,
I MEAN, OPIES IS CUT IN HALF.

PUT EVEN MORE PRESSURE

16:18.067 --> 16:20.600

16:20.633 --> 16:22.100
I GOT TO TAKE CARE
OF THE BUSINESS.

16:22.133 --> 16:25.233
I GOT TO SUPPORT MYSELF,
MY FAMILY, AND MY CREW.

16:25.267 --> 16:30.100
BOTH MY DAD AND I UNDERSTOOD
THAT, WHEN HE WAS GONE,

16:30.133 --> 16:33.100
I WAS GONNA CARRY THIS ON
SO THAT MY MOM

16:33.133 --> 16:37.400

TO WORRY ABOUT THE BUSINESS.
