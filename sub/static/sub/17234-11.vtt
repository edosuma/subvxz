<i>Previously on "Nashville"...</i>

00:03.347 --> 00:05.346
Evening, Mr. Mayor.

00:06.161 --> 00:07.355
Peggy?!

00:07.356 --> 00:09.427
We hear you're to blame
for the Wentworth separation.

00:09.452 --> 00:11.683
- Back up!
- How's it feel to be a home wrecker?

00:11.684 --> 00:15.220
All I want is to be a person
who gets to say "I love you."

00:15.238 --> 00:16.347
Scarlett.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.799
(Gunnar) You can't take this
personally.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.911
My ex is sleeping with my best friend,
and I can't take this personally?

00:20.912 --> 00:22.611
- What's this?
- Market research.

00:22.612 --> 00:25.447
- The album's not gonna sell.
- I'm buying myself out of Edgehill.

00:25.448 --> 00:27.682
How's it going with Layla?
Just great.

- Hey.

02:35.540 --> 02:37.478
I didn't expect to see you here.

02:37.479 --> 02:39.675
Glenn said you were, uh,
adding our song to your set,

02:39.676 --> 02:42.033
invited me to hear you
rehearse it. Sounds beautiful.

02:42.051 --> 02:43.501
Thank you.

02:43.536 --> 02:48.388
That was nice of him.
I'd better get back to it.

02:49.208 --> 02:51.509
(Footsteps depart)

02:51.543 --> 02:52.910
(Daphne) Is he gonna cry?

02:52.911 --> 02:55.558
I think he's... he's trying
really hard not to.

02:55.559 --> 02:58.946
<i>My wife, as you all know,</i>
<i>was...</i>

02:58.947 --> 03:01.886
<i>Shot and killed by a man</i>
<i>who clearly targeted me.</i>

03:01.887 --> 03:05.819
That man, Donald Stoffel,
was found early this morning

03:05.820 --> 03:09.345
by Nashville P.D., dead
of an apparent suicide in his home.

03:09.346 --> 03:13.331
Does that mean this is all over?
No one's trying to hurt dad anymore?

03:13.366 --> 03:16.201
Yeah. That's exactly
what it means.

03:16.235 --> 03:18.368
(Camera shutters clicking) ...Harbored
ill will toward my administration,

03:18.369 --> 03:21.741
and, in fact, blamed me
for his chronic unemployment.

03:22.781 --> 03:25.453
Because of
this man's delusion...

03:26.095 --> 03:28.343
The woman I loved is...
(Voice breaks) Gone.

03:28.344 --> 03:30.348
(Camera shutter clicking)
(Clears throat)

03:35.104 --> 03:38.504
I'm grateful for the help
of the Police Department...

03:38.505 --> 03:41.411
- What can we see dad again?
- Soon.

03:42.027 --> 03:46.095
He said the only thing that helps him
right now is having y'all around.

03:47.216 --> 03:49.557
I'll see you guys later.

03:50.352 --> 03:52.358
Hey, you still here?

03:52.359 --> 03:56.653
Yeah, the song wasn't
the only reason I came by.

03:56.654 --> 04:00.257
Just wanted to check in.
Left a couple messages and...

04:00.258 --> 04:04.084
Yeah. Uh, sorry.
I've just been swamped.

04:04.085 --> 04:05.704
Figured you were, too.

04:05.705 --> 04:09.450
Oh, yeah. You know, those dirty glasses
at the Bluebird come in fast and furious.

04:09.475 --> 04:10.800
(Chuckles)

04:12.275 --> 04:14.944
You're late, and where's
my nonfat latte, Emily?

04:14.945 --> 04:16.880
It's good to see you, too.
(Chuckles)

04:16.914 --> 04:18.723
Mmm!

04:18.724 --> 04:22.395
Well, I'm glad your aunt's okay, if
for no other reason than I get you back.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.731
- Uh, I'll catch you later. All right?
- Yeah.

04:25.896 --> 04:28.013
So you up to speed
on everything?

04:28.064 --> 04:30.301
Think so. The new head
of Edgehill's an ass.

04:30.302 --> 04:32.221
You have a 19-year-old twit
opening up for you,

04:32.222 --> 04:35.851
and, um, oh, everybody thinks you broke
up the world's most beloved couple.

04:35.852 --> 04:38.727
Yep, welcome back to my life.
(Laughs)

04:38.728 --> 04:40.843
And you told Will that
we were doing this today?

04:40.844 --> 04:43.831
Left voice messages,
though he never confirmed.

04:43.832 --> 04:47.635
Just assumed he'd show or...
you guys'd come together.

04:47.719 --> 04:48.819
Yeah. Me, too.

04:48.854 --> 04:51.188
But the last time we talked
was at the festival.

04:51.223 --> 04:54.058
- You never saw him after your show?
- No.

04:55.475 --> 04:59.845
- Talk to his roommate at all?
- No, I haven't really met his roommate.

04:59.879 --> 05:03.298
We're dating, but, um,
it's not like I know Will that well.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.289
(Knock on window)

05:05.422 --> 05:08.255
D.J.'s ready. Looks like you'll
have to talk for both of you.

05:08.273 --> 05:10.911
- Yep.
- I'll keep looking.

05:11.309 --> 05:15.195
So this new material
of yours... it's solid.

05:15.230 --> 05:19.212
That's one step above "interesting,"
but, you know, two below you liked 'em.

05:19.213 --> 05:22.742
It's not about like.
(Chuckles) It's about fit.

05:22.743 --> 05:25.443
You're Deacon Claybourne.
You've got a story.

05:25.494 --> 05:29.230
These songs? I hate to say it,
but they just skim the surface.

05:29.528 --> 05:31.580
So they're solidly
superficial songs.

05:31.581 --> 05:35.397
Look, I want you to tap into the magic
you had when you wrote with Rayna.

05:35.398 --> 05:38.418
My partners are gonna be back next
week, just for a couple of days.

05:38.457 --> 05:42.645
You think that you can dig deep,
come up with some gold by then?

05:42.993 --> 05:44.843
You bet.

05:49.958 --> 05:52.358
- I know you're in the zone, but...
- Buh-buh-buh-buh.

05:52.359 --> 05:54.811
- Seriously?
- I've just gotta get this verse down.

05:54.829 --> 05:57.316
Mr. Man wrote a Luke Wheeler/
Rayna Jaymes song,

05:57.317 --> 05:59.051
does not mean he's above answering
the door. (Doorknob rattles)

05:59.085 --> 06:00.636
Can you not bust my balls,
please?

06:00.687 --> 06:03.889
Hey. My name's Brent.
Uh, I work for Jeff Fordham.

06:03.924 --> 06:05.774
Oh, come in.

06:05.825 --> 06:06.858
Thanks.

06:06.910 --> 06:09.478
Brent. Hey.
(Door cles)

06:09.563 --> 06:11.971
You come for, uh,
another one of my songs?

06:12.002 --> 06:14.554
No. I'm actually looking
for Will.

06:14.753 --> 06:16.520
Well, he's...
he's not here.

06:16.555 --> 06:19.925
- Any idea where he might be?
- Something wrong?

06:19.926 --> 06:21.575
Uh, he had a radio interview

06:21.576 --> 06:24.445
with Layla and Watty White today
and just never showed up.

06:24.479 --> 06:26.541
- That doesn't sound like him.
- No.

06:26.542 --> 06:29.737
The tour's been on break, and no one's
heard from him since the festival.

06:29.738 --> 06:30.888
Has he been home at all?

06:30.889 --> 06:33.764
We don't really cross paths
much anymore, so...

06:33.765 --> 06:37.029
So he wouldn't have told you
where he was headed or...

06:37.030 --> 06:39.203
Um, what's going on
with him?

06:39.204 --> 06:40.471
Probably not. (Chuckles) No.

06:40.506 --> 06:43.007
Is this like a "Call the cops"
kind of situation?

06:43.041 --> 06:44.955
Maybe I'm just overreacting.

06:45.337 --> 06:47.422
Probably just needed
to clear his head.

06:47.456 --> 06:50.591
But if you guys hear from him,
uh, tell him to return my calls

06:50.604 --> 06:52.300
and that the tour's back on
in two days,

06:52.301 --> 06:55.563
and if he's not there,
then... he'll get dropped.

06:55.597 --> 06:58.744
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

07:00.014 --> 07:01.214
- Hey!
- Hey!

07:01.248 --> 07:02.580
(Giggles) (Sighs)

07:02.581 --> 07:05.668
- I'm so sorry I couldn't pick you up.
- Oh, no. Mnh-mnh.

07:05.669 --> 07:08.147
(Sighs) Glenn had me over
at sound check

07:08.148 --> 07:10.750
to hear Juliette rehearse
the song we wrote together.

07:10.751 --> 07:13.405
- Well, how's it sound?
- Honestly?

07:13.496 --> 07:15.366
It sounded pretty great.
(Bottle cap fizzes)

07:15.367 --> 07:19.263
Is that why Juliette came by,
like, 2:00 A.M. the other week?

07:19.264 --> 07:20.409
What?

07:20.410 --> 07:23.599
Well, just to tell you that
she was gonna do your song?

07:23.940 --> 07:25.339
Uh...

07:25.865 --> 07:29.367
I guess. Who knows why stars
do what they do?

07:29.402 --> 07:30.735
(Cell phone buzzing)

07:30.892 --> 07:32.818
I mean, she could have called
or something.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.629
(Buzzing continues)

07:34.630 --> 07:35.921
(Cell phone beeps)

07:35.922 --> 07:38.950
It's my publisher. Sorry.
Hello?

07:39.907 --> 07:42.704
Yeah. I'm sitting down.

07:43.269 --> 07:45.414
What? S-sorry.

07:47.708 --> 07:48.808
What?

07:48.833 --> 07:50.551
Yeah. Just...

07:50.585 --> 07:53.854
Let me know, please,
as soon as you can.

07:53.872 --> 07:55.656
Thank you.
(Cell phone beeps)

07:55.657 --> 07:58.615
Kelly Clarkson wants
to record "Fade into You."

07:58.616 --> 08:01.963
- Are you serious? That's...
- (Laughs) That's awesome.

08:01.964 --> 08:04.979
She... she wants to meet up,
like, really soon.

08:04.980 --> 08:06.544
- With you?
- Yeah.

08:06.911 --> 08:08.660
And Gunnar.

08:09.066 --> 08:11.119
Right. Yep.

08:11.873 --> 08:13.976
Cross that bridge when we come to it.
Oh, my God!

08:13.977 --> 08:15.912
Kelly Clarkson wants
to record my song!

08:15.913 --> 08:17.280
(Laughs)

08:17.999 --> 08:22.736
I'm just glad you were there that night
to take the girls home. Oh, my gosh.

08:22.942 --> 08:25.682
So how long are you gonna stay there?
(Indistinct conversations)

08:25.707 --> 08:28.175
Oh, my goodness.
All right, well,

08:28.209 --> 08:31.512
don't let the seaweed wraps
turn you green or whatever.

08:31.546 --> 08:34.523
All right, honey.
Love you. Bye.

08:34.961 --> 08:36.917
Tandy is at a spa.

08:36.951 --> 08:38.051
Oh.
(Phone ringing)

08:38.865 --> 08:40.421
- (Sighs) You okay?
- Yeah.

08:40.455 --> 08:41.917
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:41.952 --> 08:43.586
What's going on? Are they...
how are they doing?

08:43.636 --> 08:46.923
Oh, it's fantastic. And we've
almost got the web site up, and...

08:46.974 --> 08:50.710
(Cell phone chimes) The Highway 65
train has officially left the station.

08:50.728 --> 08:52.479
This just got posted...
front page news.

08:52.513 --> 08:55.265
Well, if it hits the trades,
it must be at least half-true.

08:55.266 --> 08:57.600
(Chuckles) Of course,
Edgehill put out a blurb,

08:57.651 --> 08:59.552
and they spun it like
they were getting rid of you.

08:59.570 --> 09:02.655
Nobody's gonna believe that,
especially after the record comes out.

09:02.690 --> 09:04.891
So I'm gonna go over and meet
with Liam this afternoon

09:04.909 --> 09:06.906
so we can start sequencing
the album,

09:06.907 --> 09:08.942
and then all we have to do
is figure out a release date

09:08.968 --> 09:10.245
and what single
we're gonna use.

09:10.246 --> 09:11.614
Probably should get
some market research done,

09:11.665 --> 09:13.602
see which track has
the potential to pop.

09:13.603 --> 09:17.449
- Jeff gave me his market research.
- Wait. Jeff <i>gave</i> it to you?

09:17.450 --> 09:19.935
I mean, it's probably just the same
crap they used for my last album.

09:19.936 --> 09:21.371
You saw how well
that turned out.

09:21.372 --> 09:22.340
Mm-hmm.

09:22.341 --> 09:26.430
I will be damned if I'm gonna let
Highway 65 use the Edgehill model.

09:26.597 --> 09:27.964
Yeah, I don't know.

09:27.976 --> 09:30.003
(Crowd chanting)
Oh, lovely. There they are...

09:30.004 --> 09:32.283
The kooks who protest
everything under the sun.

09:32.284 --> 09:33.902
I thought the Wentworth scandal
was over.

09:33.903 --> 09:36.292
Apparently, they didn't
get the memo.

09:36.699 --> 09:38.433
You're a disgrace!

09:38.434 --> 09:40.496
(Sighs) Do you want me
to call security?

09:40.528 --> 09:43.980
It's all right. They're just exercising
their First Amendment rights.

09:44.031 --> 09:46.566
(Window whirs)
And here's mine.

09:46.567 --> 09:48.067
(Man) Burn in hell!

09:48.092 --> 09:52.696
Season 2, Episode 11
"I'll Keep Climbing"

09:56.094 --> 09:59.094
Synced by Reef
www.addic7ed.com

10:03.595 --> 10:05.687
- Oh, crap.
- What?

10:05.828 --> 10:07.463
He left his hat on the bed,

10:07.497 --> 10:10.215
which ans he was not thinking
straight when he left.

10:10.216 --> 10:11.799
How so?

10:12.302 --> 10:16.446
(Chuckles) Everybody knows it's bad
luck to leave a hat on the bed.

10:18.248 --> 10:21.167
We should check his search history.
(Typing)

10:21.249 --> 10:24.336
Uh, you know what? Maybe...
maybe I should do that.

10:24.531 --> 10:28.096
Could be some... Some guy stuff
on there you wouldn't wanna see.

10:32.739 --> 10:35.157
(Clicks keys)

10:35.191 --> 10:38.508
What's there to do
at the Echo Ridge this time of year?

10:42.206 --> 10:45.922
Ahem. I, um, heard you're looking
for new artists to sign.

10:46.253 --> 10:49.311
What are you doing here? I thought
we were meeting at the studio.

10:49.312 --> 10:52.528
Come on. I couldn't wait.
You're saying "screw you" to the man,

10:52.529 --> 10:55.864
you buy yourself out
of Edgehill? That's awesome.

10:55.865 --> 10:57.912
(Chuckles) Such a big
turn-on, you know?

10:57.913 --> 10:59.330
(Giggles)

10:59.331 --> 11:02.417
Uh, I'm kind of seeing
somebody, actually.

11:02.784 --> 11:05.695
- Sort of dating.
- Who are we talking about?

11:05.870 --> 11:07.354
Luke Wheeler.

11:07.372 --> 11:09.873
No wonder you looked
so miserable when I walked in.

11:09.907 --> 11:11.191
(Laughs)

11:11.209 --> 11:15.028
Why am I not shocked that
you don't like Luke Wheeler?

11:15.838 --> 11:17.409
What's this crap?

11:17.410 --> 11:22.242
Mm. This is why I looked
so miserable when you walked in.

11:22.398 --> 11:25.933
Research on our album from Edgehill.
Shouldn't have looked at it, but I did.

11:25.934 --> 11:27.102
(Scoffs)
You should burn it.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.006
You know that
this market research says

11:29.007 --> 11:32.193
that "Better Days" is not
the single to launch our album.

11:32.194 --> 11:35.771
(Chuckles) Okay.
All right. (Thud)

11:35.903 --> 11:39.179
"Better Days" <i>is</i> the single.
You're the artist.

11:39.180 --> 11:42.884
Don't start second-guessing yourself.
Trust the vision. (Clears throat)

11:43.253 --> 11:46.347
Yeah, I do.
I do.

11:49.063 --> 11:51.398
(Sighs)

11:51.416 --> 11:52.899
(Slurps)

11:55.169 --> 11:58.171
(Tapping rhythmically)

11:58.206 --> 12:02.175
(Discordant chords play)

12:02.210 --> 12:04.580
- (Singsongy) Hello!
- Oh, hey!

12:04.846 --> 12:07.037
Man, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

12:07.038 --> 12:09.037
Oh. Mmm.
Mmm.

12:09.154 --> 12:10.802
- Mmm! Oh!
- What?

12:10.810 --> 12:12.155
I come bearing gifts.

12:12.156 --> 12:14.791
Souvenirs from Dayton.
Are you kidding me? (Chuckles)

12:14.840 --> 12:19.149
When you told me about your A&R
meeting, I stopped by a music store.

12:19.174 --> 12:20.227
Ohh.

12:20.228 --> 12:21.560
That is so nice.

12:21.561 --> 12:22.596
Mm.

12:22.630 --> 12:24.948
But I was really hoping
for a snow globe.

12:25.505 --> 12:26.653
No?

12:26.654 --> 12:27.809
- No.
- All right.

12:27.860 --> 12:33.693
You're under a deadline and I wanted you
to have something special to write on.

12:33.900 --> 12:37.630
Well... thank you very much.
I missed the hell out of you.

12:37.631 --> 12:40.255
I missed the hell
out of you, too. Mmm.

12:40.256 --> 12:43.289
- Ohh. Ohh.
- What?

12:43.304 --> 12:45.556
The last thing I wanna be
is a distraction.

12:45.557 --> 12:48.309
(Laughs) Well,
it's a little late for that.

12:48.343 --> 12:49.999
Hmm.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here

12:58.094 --> 12:59.194
Dad?

12:59.229 --> 13:00.179
(Rustles)

13:00.213 --> 13:01.380
Yeah, honey?

13:02.887 --> 13:05.601
You don't have to hide
how sad you are around us.

13:05.635 --> 13:07.569
'Cause we know you are.

13:08.057 --> 13:10.275
(Whispers) Come here.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.913
(Sighs) I'm not nearly as sad when
y'all are with me, you know that?

13:19.008 --> 13:21.085
Okay, so what am I gonna
make us for dinner?

13:21.086 --> 13:23.229
You're not.
We're cooking tonight.

13:23.230 --> 13:24.134
- Really?
- Yes.

13:24.135 --> 13:25.369
Mac and cheese
with hot dogs.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.490
How'd you know that's
what I wanted? (Chuckles)

13:27.884 --> 13:29.501
Thanks, honey.

13:29.536 --> 13:31.520
(Footsteps depart)

13:31.914 --> 13:33.648
She was nice.

13:35.258 --> 13:36.761
Yeah.

13:36.829 --> 13:38.908
(Sighs)

13:45.854 --> 13:48.256
(Under breath) There you are.

13:48.446 --> 13:50.874
Are these the same people
that were in Nashville?

13:50.878 --> 13:53.896
What do these guys have, frequent
flyer miles? (Unfastens seatbelt)

13:53.947 --> 13:55.865
Or nothing better to do.

13:55.916 --> 14:00.009
(Indistinct conversations)

14:00.010 --> 14:02.889
(Under breath) Anyone that girl
will <i>not</i> give an autograph to?

14:02.890 --> 14:05.942
(Crowd shouting indistinctly)

14:05.993 --> 14:07.806
Aren't you Layla Grant?

14:08.337 --> 14:11.157
- Oh. Hi.
- What do you think you're doing?

14:11.158 --> 14:12.926
Nothing. They just
called me over.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.761
And you just decided to
mix it up with some haters?

14:14.762 --> 14:18.148
Hey, sinner! What are you teaching
our children with your evil ways?

14:18.149 --> 14:19.458
Case in point.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.521
Is that what your mother
taught you?!

14:21.569 --> 14:24.359
You know she's in hell,
just like you'll be,

14:24.360 --> 14:26.461
because God punishes
the wicked,

14:26.462 --> 14:29.135
and you're just as wicked
as your junkie whore mother.

14:29.136 --> 14:32.922
There is no God that would
listen to a crackpot like you.

14:32.923 --> 14:35.164
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
What are you doing?

14:35.165 --> 14:36.950
Don't engage
with those people.

14:36.984 --> 14:39.155
No respect for Juliette.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.555
(Gunnar) Lexington!

14:43.328 --> 14:45.479
What the hell
are you doing, huh?

14:45.513 --> 14:48.699
I've been driving all over this
damn mountain trying to find you.

14:48.733 --> 14:51.808
You realize when people...
when people disappear in my life,

14:51.809 --> 14:53.972
- ...they tend to end up in a morgue.
- Don't look at me.

14:53.973 --> 14:55.085
Hey.

14:56.161 --> 14:58.472
- You all right?
- No!

14:58.847 --> 15:00.954
No, I'm not all right!

15:01.429 --> 15:02.679
I'm... (Breathing heavily)

15:02.994 --> 15:04.911
I'm disgusting.

15:05.457 --> 15:07.362
What are you...
what are you talking about?

15:07.363 --> 15:09.426
Just leave me
the hell alone!

15:11.606 --> 15:13.290
Will!

15:19.801 --> 15:22.486
(Knocks on door)

15:23.388 --> 15:25.056
(Knob turns)

15:25.387 --> 15:26.821
Hey.

15:27.538 --> 15:29.581
Um, just looking
for Gunnar.

15:29.858 --> 15:32.293
He's... not here.

15:32.942 --> 15:35.777
Well, he's not returning
my calls, and I need him to.

15:35.812 --> 15:38.724
So... (Scoffs) Would you mind
asking him to?

15:38.725 --> 15:40.309
Yeah, I can do that.

15:41.309 --> 15:44.591
- Thanks.
- You wanna come in and talk?

15:44.795 --> 15:46.045
No, thanks.

15:46.447 --> 15:49.947
You know what?
I am done feeling guilty.

15:49.969 --> 15:53.029
I've tried to apologize to you
I don't know how many times.

15:53.030 --> 15:55.503
But I fell for Gunnar
for the same reasons you did,

15:55.504 --> 15:58.719
and if you don't understand that,
I don't know what else I can do.

16:01.692 --> 16:04.493
- To your aunt's recovery.
- Ah, to employment.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.297
(Clink)
Cheers to that.

16:06.331 --> 16:07.431
(Chuckles)

16:07.449 --> 16:09.083
(Alert chirps)
Mm.

16:09.134 --> 16:12.231
Must be Juliette Barnes Press.
I've got a Google alert set for you.

16:12.232 --> 16:16.103
If it's not about me winning another
award, I do not want to hear about it.

16:16.104 --> 16:18.924
<i>There is no God.</i>
<i>There is no God.</i>

16:18.925 --> 16:20.592
<i>There is no God.</i>

16:20.627 --> 16:22.094
What?
(Glass clatters)

16:22.128 --> 16:24.096
<i>There is no God.</i>
<i>There is no God.</i>

16:24.130 --> 16:25.931
<i>There is no God.</i>
<i>There is no God.</i>

16:25.965 --> 16:28.071
I did not say that.

16:28.072 --> 16:30.022
This is ridiculous. I'll call
your lawyer and Glenn,

16:30.023 --> 16:31.576
tell 'em
it's fabricated footage.

16:31.577 --> 16:33.743
I can't believe they can put
something like that in your mouth

16:33.744 --> 16:35.392
and have it look so real.

16:35.393 --> 16:38.473
- It is real. It's...
- What, you said there is no God?

16:38.474 --> 16:40.812
"That would listen
to a crackpot like you."

16:40.813 --> 16:43.531
This is taken completely
out of context.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.142
It's just one gossip site.

16:46.143 --> 16:49.056
Maybe we can get it pulled before
anyone bothers to take it seriously.

That was amazing!

17:27.934 --> 17:29.146
Great, guys.

17:29.147 --> 17:30.668
Thank you so much
for having us.

17:30.669 --> 17:32.287
- Thanks for coming down.
- Thank you.

17:32.288 --> 17:35.425
Man, the Cadillac Three.
I can see ya on Highway 65.

17:35.426 --> 17:37.092
- I really do.
- Us, too.

17:37.093 --> 17:38.798
- We'll get back to you guys soon.
- Yeah.

17:38.832 --> 17:39.831
- Nice.
- (Man) Thank you so much.

17:39.849 --> 17:41.200
Now y'all have
a good one.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.535
(Cell phone buzzes) (Lowered
voice) They are good.

17:43.570 --> 17:44.653
- (Man) How about that, huh?
- (Man) That was nice, huh?

17:44.688 --> 17:46.107
- Oh, wow.
- What?

17:46.108 --> 17:47.929
- That duet you did with Luke?
- Yeah?

17:47.930 --> 17:50.077
Just hit number 6 on iTunes.
Still climbing.

17:50.078 --> 17:51.320
Well, look at that.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.412
Yeah. It's a hell of a parting
gift you gave Jeff Fordham.

17:53.413 --> 17:55.811
Well, it's a good parting gift for me,
'cause if that single does well,

17:55.812 --> 17:58.285
- ...it's gonna help me sell my album.
- True. True, true.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.732
So, uh, you still thinking
"Better Days" for the single?

18:00.733 --> 18:05.589
I did a really stupid thing. I looked
at that market research of Jeff's.

18:05.656 --> 18:09.552
- (Sighs) And I wish I hadn't.
- So "Better Days" isn't the single?

18:09.553 --> 18:12.429
According to the research, it says
there is not a single on the album.

18:12.430 --> 18:14.181
- Did you talk to Liam?
- Yeah.

18:14.182 --> 18:16.549
He says we're artists. We made
the album we wanted to make,

18:16.584 --> 18:20.482
and we weren't thinking about
any of that stuff, which is true.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.806
Except that...

18:23.027 --> 18:26.213
Now that it's my label, I have
to think about that stuff.

18:26.777 --> 18:28.228
(Exhaling)

18:28.262 --> 18:32.465
(Fire crackling,
crickets chirping)

18:34.578 --> 18:38.580
Wasn't sure when you were coming back,
so went ahead and made a fire.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.723
I'm guessing this had
something to do with Brent?

18:48.826 --> 18:52.629
I remember you telling me
about some guy from Austin.

18:53.163 --> 18:54.563
Is that him?

18:57.983 --> 19:01.152
- Look, I know how you're feeling.
- Really?

19:02.097 --> 19:07.181
- You get what it feels like to wanna die?
- That's why you came up here?

19:08.253 --> 19:09.870
To kill yourself?

19:10.725 --> 19:13.040
I came 'cause I couldn't.

19:13.813 --> 19:17.500
I stood on those tracks, and
I watched that train come right at me.

19:17.501 --> 19:20.019
(Exhales and sniffles)

19:20.109 --> 19:22.994
That light was so bright,
it was like... (Chuckles)

19:22.997 --> 19:27.401
Relief. (Sighs) Like a light
at the end of a tunnel

19:27.942 --> 19:30.877
and loud enough
to just drown it all out.

19:32.481 --> 19:35.483
I... I hate it.

19:35.518 --> 19:38.486
(Voice breaking)
I hate living this.

19:38.521 --> 19:40.872
I-I hate being this.

19:40.906 --> 19:43.435
(Exhales and sniffles)

19:43.853 --> 19:46.371
- You stupid son of a bitch!
- Uhh!

19:46.422 --> 19:47.790
What the hell, man?!

19:47.791 --> 19:50.261
Next time you feel like
you can't take it anymore,

19:50.262 --> 19:52.297
you don't go trying
to off yourself, okay?

19:52.298 --> 19:54.211
You find me.
You do anything but...

19:54.212 --> 19:56.530
But pull crap like this!
You hear me?!

19:59.101 --> 20:01.285
I am your friend.

20:02.764 --> 20:04.357
Look at me.

20:05.044 --> 20:06.965
Look at me.

20:09.009 --> 20:13.315
I want you to say it.
Say you promise that you will call me.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.017
I promise I'll call.

20:18.449 --> 20:19.916
Okay.

20:28.105 --> 20:29.782
It's not what I hoped.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.226
Is it ever?

20:34.393 --> 20:36.678
(Crickets chirping)

20:37.346 --> 20:38.646
(Plays chord)

20:40.724 --> 20:44.986
- Sustenance for the artiste.
- (Sighs) I'm not hungry.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.096
(Sighs) Okay.

20:47.147 --> 20:50.543
For the record,
I hate that word... "artiste."

20:51.592 --> 20:53.609
Okay. Well, I can just
put this in the fridge,

20:53.610 --> 20:55.544
- ...and you can have it later.
- I don't want it, all right?

20:55.545 --> 20:58.816
So just... take it with you.
I didn't ask for it.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.693
So you're saying
you want me to leave?

21:01.728 --> 21:04.963
I'm saying I want you to stop
bothering me, if that's all right.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.738
Okay. I wasn't aware
I was bothering you.

21:06.749 --> 21:08.951
Yeah, well,
all this niceness...

21:08.985 --> 21:10.451
this "can I help you?
Is there anything you need?"

21:10.452 --> 21:14.245
That... I'm not a kid doing
my homework here, all right?

21:14.246 --> 21:16.582
I'm... I'm workin',
and it can't be forced.

21:16.583 --> 21:18.919
Okay, you're under a lot
of pressure. I get it...

21:18.920 --> 21:21.888
You don't get it, Megan.
You don't. 'Cause you know why?

21:21.922 --> 21:24.624
You're a lawyer, all right?
I'm not writing a brief here.

21:24.642 --> 21:26.660
I'm writing a song.
It's a different ball game.

21:26.980 --> 21:28.080
(Plate thuds)

21:28.081 --> 21:31.884
You know what?
You wanna fight, go ahead.

21:31.935 --> 21:34.837
But you don't get to accuse me
of doing things I'm not doing.

21:34.838 --> 21:37.828
I tell you what you <i>are</i> doing,
is you're bugging the hell out of me.

21:38.825 --> 21:40.509
Now I'm not.

21:50.299 --> 21:53.418
(Sighs) Look, man,
it's the 21st century.

21:53.523 --> 21:57.609
It is okay to...
Be whatever.

22:00.306 --> 22:02.866
Not if I'm gonna keep
doing what I do for a living.

22:02.867 --> 22:03.967
(Sniffles)

22:03.968 --> 22:06.404
You're too good
to give up...

22:06.405 --> 22:09.122
On anything,
especially your life.

22:09.157 --> 22:13.426
Yeah, well, truth is, if it ain't happened
yet, it's probably not gonna happen.

22:14.019 --> 22:16.813
- You mean hurting yourself?
- Yeah.

22:17.898 --> 22:21.219
And if that's not
gonna happen, then, uh...

22:21.242 --> 22:23.466
Something else has got to.

22:28.887 --> 22:31.165
Like me getting some sleep
for the first time

22:31.166 --> 22:33.734
in I don't think how long, so...
(Clatter)

22:33.735 --> 22:35.135
(Sighs)

22:35.384 --> 22:37.322
You go on home.

22:38.517 --> 22:40.187
I'll be fine.

22:44.337 --> 22:46.672
(Inhales deeply)

22:50.277 --> 22:52.979
- Detective, come on in.
- Mr. Mayor, you wanted to see me?

22:52.980 --> 22:56.642
Yes. Yes, I did. I wanted
to follow up, because...

22:56.643 --> 22:59.453
I've been going over
the evidence of this case, and...

22:59.454 --> 23:02.692
Sir, for your own sake, I strongly
suggest you not reviewing this material.

23:02.693 --> 23:05.109
Well, I-I'm just trying
to make sense of it to...

23:05.110 --> 23:06.994
To understand
this man's motives.

23:07.124 --> 23:08.642
Now we didn't know
each other.

23:08.693 --> 23:10.911
I have only been mayor
for less than a year,

23:10.945 --> 23:13.992
and this guy lost his job
five years ago.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.465
That doesn't make sense.

23:15.466 --> 23:18.061
Sir, with respect, making sense
of an obviously disturbed mind...

23:18.062 --> 23:21.142
Yeah, but... yeah, but what...
what did... what had I done to him?

23:21.143 --> 23:23.852
Or anyone
to justify what happened?

23:23.866 --> 23:26.418
Are we absolutely sure
that there's not more to it?

23:26.452 --> 23:28.703
That there... there isn't
a continued threat?

23:28.737 --> 23:31.950
We can provide you with additional
security if you have concerns.

23:31.951 --> 23:34.603
It's not me
that I'm worried about.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.748
(Crowd)
No respect for Juliette!

23:36.749 --> 23:38.766
No respect for Juliette!

23:38.767 --> 23:42.841
What is wrong with these people?
This is not news.

23:42.870 --> 23:47.490
(Crowd shouting indistinctly
in slow motion)

23:47.784 --> 23:53.406
(Crowd cheering)

24:06.765 --> 24:08.632
(Cell phone chimes)

24:10.628 --> 24:14.555
<i>Hi, Gunnar. It's Scarlett. Uh, Kelly
Clarkson's people just called me...</i>

24:14.556 --> 24:16.788
(Gasps) <i>And they wanna
record "Fade into You."</i>

24:16.789 --> 24:19.123
<i>So, yeah, call me back. Bye.</i>

24:19.141 --> 24:23.594
- Thought you'd be gone.
- Slept in the truck.

24:24.981 --> 24:28.967
(Sighs) Wanted to stick around,
see how you're feeling.

24:29.916 --> 24:35.008
- You looked pretty happy on that phone.
- Scarlett, of all people.

24:35.933 --> 24:39.484
Seems Kelly Clarkson wants
to record a song we wrote together.

24:42.149 --> 24:44.668
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

24:45.156 --> 24:46.256
(Thud)

24:48.953 --> 24:50.607
That's what matters, man.

24:50.658 --> 24:52.013
(Grunts)

24:52.124 --> 24:53.941
Making it happen.

24:55.922 --> 24:57.380
You gonna be all right?

24:58.724 --> 25:00.942
You go on.
I'll see you back there.

25:00.993 --> 25:03.962
I gotta pack up
and catch a plane to Pittsburgh.

25:03.996 --> 25:05.113
(Chuckles)

25:05.164 --> 25:06.948
(Cell phone rings)

25:06.983 --> 25:09.351
(Ring)

25:09.385 --> 25:12.037
(Ring)

25:12.071 --> 25:13.471
(Ring)

25:16.089 --> 25:18.568
- Hey, Joey, how you doing, man?
- How's the magic coming?

25:18.575 --> 25:19.909
Could not be better.

25:19.943 --> 25:23.239
<i>Fantastic, 'cause I set up a meeting
with the partners in two days.</i>

25:23.240 --> 25:25.307
Two days. That's...

25:27.017 --> 25:29.411
- That's perfect.
- See you then.

25:33.824 --> 25:35.933
(Sighs)

25:38.768 --> 25:40.807
Are you okay?

25:42.817 --> 25:45.121
Did you see their faces?

25:46.344 --> 25:49.753
I've never seen that before.
They hated me.

25:49.754 --> 25:51.354
They are in the minority.

25:51.389 --> 25:53.955
Don't forget about the millions
who love you. (Cell phone rings)

25:53.956 --> 25:55.192
(Ring)

25:55.226 --> 25:57.551
It's Avery.
Do you wanna take it?

25:57.576 --> 25:58.895
(Ring)

25:59.634 --> 26:01.587
No, talking gets me
in trouble.

26:01.588 --> 26:03.639
I need to learn how
to keep my mouth shut.

26:03.674 --> 26:05.758
You didn't say
anything wrong.

26:05.781 --> 26:08.711
It's just too bad we don't have
the full footage to prove it.

26:08.712 --> 26:11.114
They'll never give that to us.
Are you kiddin'?

26:11.115 --> 26:15.692
And even if they did, the press will
probably accuse me of doctoring it.

26:17.528 --> 26:19.646
You know what
the craziest part is?

26:20.165 --> 26:24.472
I could go out there, stand
in the middle of the stage, and...

26:25.368 --> 26:29.171
Scream the truth at the top of my lungs,
and nobody would believe me.

26:29.172 --> 26:32.977
Do you think they would believe Layla?
She was right there, wasn't she?

26:34.538 --> 26:35.955
(Knock on door)

26:35.956 --> 26:37.476
(Rayna) Thank you.

26:38.143 --> 26:39.299
Hey.

26:39.526 --> 26:42.383
- Hey. Thanks. For coming.
- Yeah, of course.

26:42.384 --> 26:45.912
Look, I know it's my week with the girls,
but I really need you to take them.

26:45.913 --> 26:46.850
Okay.

26:46.851 --> 26:49.332
I don't mean to scare you,
but the man who tried to kill me...

26:49.333 --> 26:52.233
- He may not have acted alone.
- Oh, my God.

26:52.234 --> 26:56.133
I mean, we... we don't know for sure, but
a lot of this isn't adding up, and...

26:56.134 --> 27:00.010
I mean, the bottom line is, I was
the target, and I'm still alive, so...

27:01.028 --> 27:04.615
I don't wanna take a chance
with the girls' safety or yours.

27:05.133 --> 27:06.486
I just...

27:06.627 --> 27:09.810
I just think it's best that I keep
my distance for a while, okay?

27:09.811 --> 27:12.870
Um, yeah.
You know, whatever you need.

27:12.911 --> 27:16.263
I don't know. Just tell the girls
that I'm busy at work or...

27:16.477 --> 27:18.226
Okay.

27:19.330 --> 27:21.731
Yeah, Lord knows they've been
through enough this year.

27:22.139 --> 27:24.660
I need you
to do me a favor.

27:25.369 --> 27:28.360
Of course. Anything.

27:29.106 --> 27:33.442
I need you to tell the media
what I really said to those lunatics.

27:33.981 --> 27:37.055
Gee, I'd love to,
but I don't...

27:37.056 --> 27:40.033
But what? You were
standing right there.

27:40.694 --> 27:42.834
It was really loud
and chaotic.

27:42.835 --> 27:46.020
(Scoffs) Oh, come on.
You heard every word.

27:48.406 --> 27:51.325
I just need you
to repeat it publicly.

27:51.326 --> 27:53.279
Why would anyone
believe me?

27:53.313 --> 27:56.434
Because as far as anybody who
doesn't know you is concerned,

27:56.435 --> 27:59.370
you're as pure
as the driven snow.

27:59.405 --> 28:04.446
And I'm supposed to put that
reputation on the line for you?

28:04.447 --> 28:07.140
Yeah, you are,
because it's the truth,

28:07.141 --> 28:11.871
and because if this does not
go away, our tour will.

28:14.545 --> 28:17.789
And I will owe you one.

30:05.843 --> 30:07.027
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

30:07.061 --> 30:08.929
Do you have any other
new material?

30:08.963 --> 30:12.499
Oh. We haven't written
together recently, no.

30:12.533 --> 30:15.414
Well, would you ever consider
writing with me in mind?

30:15.415 --> 30:18.271
That would be... amazing.
Right?

30:18.272 --> 30:19.623
That would be an honor.

30:19.657 --> 30:22.392
Good, good, because
it's just emotionally so honest.

30:22.426 --> 30:24.894
It's such a special connection
that you two have,

30:24.929 --> 30:27.247
and there's really nothing else to say.
Y'all just sound great together.

30:27.298 --> 30:30.400
I guess we just kind of,
uh, just kind of clicked...

30:30.434 --> 30:31.568
Me and Scarlett.

30:31.848 --> 30:33.382
Wow, you are very lucky.

30:33.450 --> 30:36.847
But I'm getting together songs right
now for my next album pretty quickly,

30:36.918 --> 30:38.285
and I was just hoping

30:38.319 --> 30:40.170
that y'all wouldn't mind locking
yourselves away for a few days,

30:40.204 --> 30:42.072
just to write some stuff,
see what happens.

30:42.106 --> 30:44.791
Miss Clarkson, I'm thrilled
that you wanna record our song,

30:44.826 --> 30:47.594
and I'm so grateful
for this opportunity

30:47.595 --> 30:49.426
that you've given us
to work with you. I just...

30:49.427 --> 30:51.478
I thought I could make it work,

30:51.682 --> 30:54.730
but... I can't.

30:55.722 --> 30:56.889
Uh...

30:56.923 --> 30:59.109
Gunnar and I are not
really at a place

30:59.110 --> 31:01.195
where we can write
together anymore.

31:01.229 --> 31:03.430
Um, what... what... what Scarlett
means is

31:03.465 --> 31:05.232
- That we're trying to...
- We've had our differences.

31:05.267 --> 31:10.474
I'm afraid that... the songs
that you would be wantin'...

31:10.475 --> 31:12.520
Are not the ones
that you would get.

31:12.521 --> 31:16.402
So I'm really sorry. I just
didn't wanna waste your time.

31:19.182 --> 31:21.149
(Door opens and closes)

31:24.269 --> 31:26.153
It's complicated.

31:35.258 --> 31:38.126
Oh, my God. You made it.

31:40.198 --> 31:42.783
I was worried sick.

31:43.048 --> 31:47.972
Yeah. I, uh, I probably should've left
you a note or something. I'm sorry.

31:48.044 --> 31:50.878
Where'd you go?
Is everything all right?

31:50.879 --> 31:54.730
Yeah. I just needed to get away from
everything for a little while, you know?

31:55.528 --> 31:57.262
You mean me, don't you?

31:57.569 --> 32:00.421
No. (Chuckles) Layla...

32:00.456 --> 32:05.259
We're good. We're fine.
I-I just need to focus on my music, too.

32:09.758 --> 32:11.802
(Button clicks, elevator
bell dings) You comin'?

32:11.827 --> 32:13.127
(Liam) What's up?

32:13.128 --> 32:15.462
- I wanna talk to you about "Better Days."
- Okay.

32:15.783 --> 32:19.993
So I took the liberty of
sending it out to a few people...

32:19.994 --> 32:24.103
Friends and family, some programmers
who I really respect and trust.

32:24.104 --> 32:28.112
And I have to tell you, the consensus
across the board is that...

32:28.796 --> 32:30.812
You know,
it's... it's a great song,

32:30.813 --> 32:33.616
but it's just not the song
that's gonna launch our album.

32:33.617 --> 32:36.186
Okay, that's exactly like
what that research thing

32:36.220 --> 32:37.921
- ...from Edgehill said, right?
- Yeah.

32:37.955 --> 32:40.671
Yeah. Since when do you start caring
so much about what other people think?

32:40.672 --> 32:42.447
It's not that I care so much
about what other people think...

32:42.448 --> 32:43.881
No, come on.
You're saying "to hell"

32:43.882 --> 32:46.467
"with my instincts and my gut.
I'm just gonna play it safe."

32:46.622 --> 32:49.240
I... play it safe?
I have leveraged everything...

32:49.241 --> 32:52.683
<i>Everything</i> for this label...
my house, my stocks.

32:52.684 --> 32:54.752
I have risked everything
that I have.

32:54.770 --> 32:56.237
That's what you do
as an artist.

32:56.271 --> 32:59.156
It's so easy for you 'cause you
only have yourself to answer to.

32:59.191 --> 33:01.320
I have two daughters...

33:02.673 --> 33:06.092
Who have been through so much,
and if anything happens...

33:06.127 --> 33:09.896
If anything goes wrong with
this album or with this label,

33:09.931 --> 33:13.331
it's just gonna be more upheaval
for them, and I'm not gonna risk that,

33:13.332 --> 33:17.141
not for my artistic
integrity or anything.

33:20.601 --> 33:22.107
You're right.

33:23.594 --> 33:27.220
- You're so sexy when you're right.
- (Scoffs) You never quit.

33:27.221 --> 33:28.965
I couldn't pretend that
I could work with him again,

33:28.966 --> 33:32.113
and I can't pretend every time I see his
stupid face, I don't just wanna punch it.

33:32.114 --> 33:33.934
Really? Really? You wanna
punch him in the face?

33:33.935 --> 33:35.837
I'm not actually
going to punch him in the face.

33:35.838 --> 33:37.861
You broke up with the guy.

33:38.048 --> 33:40.651
Now he's seeing someone else
now, and so are you.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.453
Why... why is it so hard
to be around him?

33:42.454 --> 33:43.772
I mean, you still have
feelings for him?

33:43.773 --> 33:45.817
I don't know. Do you have
feelings for Juliette?

33:46.038 --> 33:47.939
- You're kidding me, right?
- No.

33:47.940 --> 33:50.088
You don't turn up
at somebody's house at 2:00 A.M.

33:50.089 --> 33:51.930
- ...unless something's pulling you there.
- She has nothing to do with this.

33:51.931 --> 33:54.132
I saw the way
you looked at her, Avery.

33:57.394 --> 34:00.932
We're like old slippers.
Aren't we?

34:00.965 --> 34:05.672
We just... Stepped back in and tried
to pick up where we left off.

34:05.914 --> 34:08.754
Yeah. We did. (Huffs)

34:10.581 --> 34:12.706
But we're not the same.

34:13.322 --> 34:14.589
No.

34:15.713 --> 34:17.581
I guess we're not.

34:17.762 --> 34:21.148
Ugh! I can't believe she just
tanked a meetg with Kelly Clarkson.

34:21.181 --> 34:23.147
I never thought
Scarlett would be like this.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.255
I just thought...

34:24.257 --> 34:26.234
I really thought if we could
work together again,

34:26.235 --> 34:28.219
we might be able to put all
this stuff behind us, you know?

34:28.254 --> 34:30.571
Maybe be friends again.
(Sighs)

34:30.873 --> 34:32.407
(Whispers) Yeah.

34:32.440 --> 34:34.983
(Normal voice) Well,
that's not happening.

34:35.706 --> 34:39.437
Hey, I'm sorry.
Okay? I'm sorry.

34:39.694 --> 34:42.844
(Sighs) You know what?
I'm not.

34:43.664 --> 34:47.638
I'm not sorry at all,
because I love you.

34:55.777 --> 34:57.160
I love you, too.

35:04.068 --> 35:07.919
I appreciate you coming over,
you know, especially after I, uh...

35:07.920 --> 35:10.455
Behaved like a complete
and total asshat?

35:10.892 --> 35:14.828
I was gonna say "jerk,"
but... yeah. That.

35:15.330 --> 35:19.299
Can I ask how it's going without
getting my head bitten off?

35:19.333 --> 35:21.184
You can.

35:21.600 --> 35:24.087
- How's it going?
- Not great.

35:24.705 --> 35:28.405
- You wanna know who I blame?
- It'd better not be me.

35:29.090 --> 35:30.991
It's you.

35:31.353 --> 35:32.960
Partially.

35:33.937 --> 35:37.290
A couple of hours ago, I was sitting
in front of a liquor store in my truck.

35:37.898 --> 35:40.985
I was wondering if the answer to all
this was in the bottom of a bottle.

35:40.986 --> 35:44.772
- I didn't go in. I didn't drink.
- Good. I'm glad.

35:46.966 --> 35:50.423
My whole life, I've known
how to write songs...

35:50.458 --> 35:54.904
From a place of pain,
you know, or chaos.

35:55.379 --> 35:58.999
Heartache. And right
now I'm just...

35:59.603 --> 36:03.420
Trying every damn thing I can to figure
out how to do that when I'm happy.

36:05.222 --> 36:06.389
So...

36:07.420 --> 36:09.967
- You're happy.
- Yeah.

36:11.607 --> 36:15.405
'Cause of you, 'cause of Maddie,
'cause of this music,

36:15.451 --> 36:18.123
I'm... happy, and...

36:19.369 --> 36:22.109
It's just gonna take
some getting used to.

36:22.823 --> 36:24.524
(Chuckles)

36:28.737 --> 36:32.857
Just so you know, my management team
is really against me doing this.

36:32.891 --> 36:36.960
(Chuckles) They're amateurs. And if
they drop you, I'll manage you myself.

36:38.977 --> 36:42.867
What they don't understand
is all we're asking you to do

36:42.868 --> 36:45.186
is go up there
and tell the truth.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.271
(Glenn) It's time.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.740
<i>(Man speaking indistinctly)</i>

36:49.774 --> 36:51.906
(Under breath)
Here goes nothing.

36:52.234 --> 36:54.412
(Indistinct conversations)

36:54.479 --> 36:55.980
Thank you all
for being here today.

36:56.014 --> 37:00.354
I'm the last person in the world
who would defend Juliette Barnes

37:00.355 --> 37:02.803
if she actually said
what was on that tape,

37:03.023 --> 37:07.961
because as some of you may know,
I hold very deep religious beliefs,

37:07.995 --> 37:11.347
and I would not betray those
beliefs for anyone or anything.

37:11.398 --> 37:14.100
I was there that day.
I heard it myself.

37:14.134 --> 37:19.005
The clip that's making the rounds
doesn't tell the whole story.

37:19.039 --> 37:22.572
When those protestors were screaming
horrible things about her mother,

37:22.573 --> 37:24.330
Juliette responded.

37:24.331 --> 37:27.468
She said, "There is no God..."

37:28.849 --> 37:31.768
"Who would listen
to a crackpot like you."

37:31.819 --> 37:33.888
She killed it.

37:34.318 --> 37:38.324
She better have,
or something else is gonna die,

37:38.359 --> 37:40.302
like my career.

37:49.199 --> 37:50.449
(Door closes)
All right.

37:50.467 --> 37:52.612
I know that was quite
an entrance, but... (Chuckles)

37:52.613 --> 37:54.689
Your duet with Luke Wheeler
just hit number one.

37:54.723 --> 37:55.957
Ohh.

37:55.991 --> 37:58.276
- Well, how about that?
- Yeah, how about that?

37:58.490 --> 38:00.224
Jeff Fordham
must be thrilled.

38:00.448 --> 38:03.475
Yeah, but did you her the latest
Juliette Barnes thing?

38:03.476 --> 38:05.710
Yeah.
You know, I have to say,

38:05.745 --> 38:07.879
she's said a lot of
crazy stuff before,

38:07.914 --> 38:09.871
but I can't believe
she said that.

38:09.872 --> 38:11.536
You know Jeff's
freaking out, though.

38:11.537 --> 38:13.622
Oh. (Chuckles)
(Laughs)

38:13.667 --> 38:16.235
Forget about Jeff.
Focus. Highway 65.

38:16.236 --> 38:18.337
- Here we go. Um...
- All right.

38:18.355 --> 38:19.606
I did make a decision.

38:20.132 --> 38:22.700
I'm not gonna use "Better Days"
for our single.

38:22.735 --> 38:25.417
- Means we need a song.
- Well, write one.

38:25.418 --> 38:26.644
Yeah, no pressure.

38:26.645 --> 38:28.950
Well, it's not like you haven't
done it before, right?

38:29.074 --> 38:31.459
Look, don't let this
market research

38:31.510 --> 38:33.244
and your last record
shake your confidence.

38:33.278 --> 38:36.248
You can write a hit single
for this new album.

38:36.249 --> 38:38.349
- You know why?
- Because I have to.

38:38.367 --> 38:40.566
Because you're
a brilliant songwriter.

38:40.567 --> 38:42.001
Heck, I remember when
you and Deacon

38:42.035 --> 38:44.737
used to knock out future number
ones between dessert and coffee.

38:44.771 --> 38:47.756
Boy, that seems
like a long time ago.

38:47.791 --> 38:50.134
(Indistinct conversations)
Will.

38:50.326 --> 38:53.984
- I was worried. Where were you?
- Uh, don't do that.

38:53.985 --> 38:55.185
What's going on?

38:55.186 --> 38:57.161
Look, I'm not gonna need
a minder on the road.

38:57.162 --> 39:00.331
I got things under control,
so you tell Jeff thanks but, uh...

39:00.366 --> 39:02.366
- You can go on back to Nashville.
- Wait, Will...

39:02.384 --> 39:03.585
- It's...
- Don't!

39:03.636 --> 39:05.186
It's okay.

39:05.516 --> 39:08.488
You're just freaking out a little bit.
Everything's gonna be fine.

39:08.489 --> 39:10.671
Nothing's gonna be fine
between us...

39:10.672 --> 39:12.719
Ever again.

39:16.037 --> 39:18.201
I tell you what.
That is not half-bad.

39:18.202 --> 39:20.370
I'd say
it was pretty half-good.

39:20.404 --> 39:22.038
(Chuckles)
(Chuckles) You're right.

39:22.466 --> 39:24.177
(Knock on door) Come in. Hey!

39:24.178 --> 39:27.026
Mom, you have got to hear
the song Deacon and I just wrote.

39:27.044 --> 39:29.079
(Deacon) Yeah. I mean, we wrote
it in, like, five minutes.

39:29.080 --> 39:31.331
- Well, maybe ten.
- Maybe ten.

39:31.332 --> 39:32.449
I wanna hear it.

39:32.521 --> 39:33.750
- I wanna hear it.
- (Deacon) Let's do it.

39:33.801 --> 39:34.911
- 10-minute song.
- (Maddie) Okay.

39:34.912 --> 39:36.920
- (Daphne) Yes.
