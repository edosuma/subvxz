00:02.700 --> 00:04.699
# We're not going out

00:04.700 --> 00:06.699
# Not staying in

00:06.700 --> 00:09.699
# Just hanging around
With my head in a spin

00:09.700 --> 00:11.699
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

00:11.700 --> 00:15.699
# We're not going out

00:15.700 --> 00:18.700
# We are not going out. #

00:22.050 --> 00:24.049
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm going to get you!</font>

00:24.051 --> 00:26.050
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm going to get you!</font>

00:26.051 --> 00:28.050
Blimey, have you seen
Molly's Barbie doll?

00:28.051 --> 00:30.160
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, what's the matter?</font>

00:30.162 --> 00:34.294
One of the kids has
drawn... something on it.

00:34.295 --> 00:36.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> I think the word you're looking for
is nipples. </font>Yeah, all right.

00:36.360 --> 00:39.027
<font color="#00FFFF"> What? There's nothing wrong
with the word nipples.</font>

00:39.028 --> 00:41.359
There is when it's in the same
sentence as Barbie doll.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.360
It's like saying your
Action Man's got chlamydia.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> What type of action
has he been getting?</font>

00:49.360 --> 00:52.359
Don't you think it's a bit weird?

00:52.360 --> 00:54.760
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, maybe they should
have used a pink felt tip.</font>

00:54.761 --> 00:58.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> I've only ever seen
orange ones on Love Island.</font>

00:58.360 --> 01:01.359
They're a bit young for that sort
of thing, aren't they?

01:01.360 --> 01:04.760
<font color="#00FFFF"> Benji, Molly?
Who drew nipples on Molly's doll?</font>

01:04.760 --> 01:07.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Me. </font>And why did you do that, Benji?</font>

01:07.360 --> 01:09.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> Because she took
my Match Attax album</font>

01:09.360 --> 01:12.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> and drew a willy on Harry Kane.</font>

01:12.360 --> 01:16.028
Why have my little angels suddenly
turned into Roy Chubby Brown?

01:17.761 --> 01:19.294
Where are they off now?

01:19.295 --> 01:21.359
To draw a foofoo
on Mrs Potato Head?

01:21.360 --> 01:24.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> They're just a bit giddy
because they had RSE at school.</font>

01:24.360 --> 01:27.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> What, using the keyboards too much?</font>
That's RSI.</font>

01:27.360 --> 01:30.360
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh. </font>RSE is relationship
and sex education.</font>

01:30.361 --> 01:34.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> Sex education? They're not learning
that already, surely? </font>Yeah.</font>

01:34.360 --> 01:37.027
<font color="#00FFFF"> And you're all right with that?</font>
I'm fine.</font>

01:37.028 --> 01:39.359
But you don't let them
watch Doctor Who?

01:39.360 --> 01:41.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> Doctor Who is not the same
as the facts of life -</font>

01:41.360 --> 01:44.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> it's got nothing to do with how the
kids came to exist in the world.</font>

01:44.360 --> 01:46.294
Yes, it has. You got pregnant
with the twins

01:46.295 --> 01:48.895
after we watched that Christmas
episode with the Cyberwoman.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.359
They're far too young
for sex education.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, how old were you?</font>
Well, we didn't have it.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.359
I waited until I was a teenager
and learned everything

01:58.360 --> 02:00.627
I needed to know from old
copies of Razzle.

02:00.628 --> 02:03.360
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm surprised you never got RSI.</font>

02:04.494 --> 02:06.027
I'm not happy about this.

02:06.028 --> 02:09.161
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, do you want us to go and talk
to the teacher? </font>Yes, I do.

02:09.162 --> 02:11.162
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's Miss Anstice. </font>No, I don't.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.360
She doesn't like me.

02:13.361 --> 02:15.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> Doesn't like you?
She doesn't know you.</font>

02:15.360 --> 02:17.493
<font color="#00FFFF"> If she knew you,
she wouldn't like you.</font>

02:17.494 --> 02:20.294
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, right, I'll make an appointment
to see her. </font>Fine.

02:20.295 --> 02:23.359
Let's go find out what filth this
pornmonger is forcing on our babies.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.360
<font color="#00FFFF"> That's the spirit -
go with an open mind.</font>

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.360 --> 02:39.295
<font color="#FFFF00"> So, what questions
do you have exactly?</font>

02:42.360 --> 02:45.294
<font color="#FFFF00"> You don't need to raise your hand.</font>

02:45.295 --> 02:49.359
We just wanted to know, you know,
what exactly you're teaching them

02:49.360 --> 02:51.161
during these lessons.

02:51.162 --> 02:53.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> RSE covers a wide spectrum.</font>

02:53.360 --> 02:56.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> Reproduction is obviously one
of them, but also social themes</font>

02:56.360 --> 03:01.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> like emotional wellbeing,
families and, of course,</font>

03:01.360 --> 03:03.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> good bodily hygiene.</font>

03:03.360 --> 03:07.161
<font color="#00FFFF"> I don't expect you've got
a spare pamphlet, have you?</font>

03:07.162 --> 03:10.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> This week we were learning the
differences between boys and girls</font>

03:10.360 --> 03:12.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> and the correct name
for the body parts.</font>

03:12.360 --> 03:15.359
So that's why Benji keeps yelling
out about his... you know...

03:15.360 --> 03:17.162
<font color="#FFFF00"> Penis?</font>

03:18.295 --> 03:19.361
<font color="#FFFF00"> Or testicles?</font>

03:21.360 --> 03:24.360
Do the kids get multiple choice,
or is it just me?

03:25.628 --> 03:28.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> The children learn the correct name
for their body parts</font>

03:28.360 --> 03:31.294
<font color="#FFFF00"> to reduce the level of giggling
and smuttiness.</font>

03:31.295 --> 03:34.359
Well, there's another way
of reducing giggling and smuttiness.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> How? </font>Teach them maths
and English instead.

03:36.628 --> 03:40.361
<font color="#FFFF00"> We are teaching them English -
with new words, like testicles.</font>

03:42.360 --> 03:44.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> And by teaching them
that boys have two,</font>

03:44.360 --> 03:46.360
<font color="#FFFF00"> that's the maths covered, as well.</font>

03:49.360 --> 03:52.493
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I see the importance
of using the correct terminology.</font>

03:52.494 --> 03:55.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> It could cause all sorts
of confusion and emotional turmoil</font>

03:55.360 --> 03:58.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> if the kids are all running
around using different slang words</font>

03:58.360 --> 04:00.360
<font color="#FFFF00"> for body parts. </font>Oh, bollocks.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.360
For example.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.360
<font color="#FFFF00"> Exactly.</font>

04:05.361 --> 04:07.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> Wrong terminology.</font>

04:07.360 --> 04:09.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> Which they often
pick up from parents.</font>

04:09.360 --> 04:11.359
Oh, what's wrong
with having a willy?

04:11.360 --> 04:14.360
I've got a feeling
you're going to tell me.

04:15.628 --> 04:18.358
So what other things
are you teaching them?

04:18.360 --> 04:21.894
<font color="#FFFF00"> In the next lesson, we begin
the module on human reproduction.</font>

04:21.894 --> 04:24.760
<font color="#FFFF00"> As the children put it,
where do babies come from?</font>

04:24.761 --> 04:26.494
<font color="#FFFF00"> Sex. </font>Well done.</font>

04:28.360 --> 04:32.027
<font color="#FFFF00"> I might put you on
the good child rainbow.</font>

04:32.028 --> 04:34.359
I mean, just say it like it is -
you're teaching them sex.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, we're teaching
them reproduction.</font>

04:36.628 --> 04:38.359
Is there a difference?

04:38.360 --> 04:40.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> Would you like
to join us for a lesson?</font>

04:40.360 --> 04:43.360
<font color="#FFFF00"> You'd be surprised
what some parents don't know.</font>

04:46.360 --> 04:50.627
I know she doesn't look
well enough to have sex.

04:50.628 --> 04:55.360
Why is there a picture of
a piglet's head over her whatsit?

04:59.162 --> 05:02.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> I appreciate your concern, but
we feel that unless we teach them</font>

05:02.360 --> 05:05.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> from a very early age,
all kinds of playground gossip</font>

05:05.360 --> 05:07.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> gets embedded in their minds.</font>

05:07.360 --> 05:10.027
<font color="#FFFF00"> For example, one child recently
announced to the class</font>

05:10.028 --> 05:13.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> that if a woman fills a washing-up
bowl full of Coca-Cola</font>

05:13.360 --> 05:15.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> and sits in it,
she can't get pregnant.</font>

05:15.360 --> 05:17.493
Well, that's true, isn't it?

05:17.494 --> 05:20.360
She needs to have sex, as well.

05:25.361 --> 05:27.359
I told you she didn't like me.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I didn't like you
to start with.</font>

05:29.360 --> 05:32.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> Give her a couple of decades
and a lot of alcohol...</font>

05:32.360 --> 05:35.359
I do not want that woman
teaching my kids the facts of life.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> I bet she's never even done it.</font>
Done it?</font>

05:37.360 --> 05:39.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> Why don't you put your finger
in your fist</font>

05:39.360 --> 05:41.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> and give me the full practical,
professor?</font>

05:41.360 --> 05:43.894
If she ever got a man into bed,
it wouldn't be reproduction -

05:43.895 --> 05:45.359
it would be abduction.

05:45.360 --> 05:48.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> Look, I know she's a little uptight,
but she's a good teacher.</font>

05:48.360 --> 05:50.760
<font color="#00FFFF"> You don't have a problem
with how she teaches geography.</font>

05:50.761 --> 05:52.894
No-one ever grew up to be
a crackhead or a porn star

05:52.895 --> 05:56.359
because they were scarred
by a lesson on oxbow lakes.

05:56.360 --> 05:57.360
So what next?

05:57.361 --> 05:59.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'll tell you exactly what next.</font>

05:59.360 --> 06:02.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> You're going to drop this right now
and let her do her job.</font>

06:02.360 --> 06:05.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> Agreed? </font>Oh, fine.

06:05.360 --> 06:08.161
But I still think kids grow up
far too quickly nowadays.

06:08.162 --> 06:10.359
No wonder there's so many
teenage pregnancies.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.360
<font color="#00FFFF"> Just because kids understand sex,</font>

06:11.361 --> 06:14.294
<font color="#00FFFF"> it doesn't mean they immediately
rush out and do it.</font>

06:14.295 --> 06:16.162
<font color="#00FFFF"> You know what reading is.</font>

06:22.360 --> 06:23.360
Toby, you're a doctor.

06:23.361 --> 06:25.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> I've got a rule on my day off.</font>

06:25.360 --> 06:27.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> If I can't see it without
you getting undressed,</font>

06:27.360 --> 06:29.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm not looking at it.</font>

06:29.360 --> 06:32.359
It's about... sex.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.161
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, that's very flattering,</font>

06:34.162 --> 06:36.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> but can we wait until
my lemon muffin has settled?</font>

06:36.360 --> 06:39.359
When did your Jack start asking
about the facts of life?

06:39.360 --> 06:41.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> Ah, a couple of years ago.</font>

06:41.360 --> 06:44.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> Anna bought him a book. </font>What book?

06:44.360 --> 06:47.360
<font color="#00FFFF"> A Harry Potter
first edition, I think.</font>

06:48.761 --> 06:50.294
Well, how did that help?

06:50.295 --> 06:52.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> It didn't, it was
a distraction technique.</font>

06:52.360 --> 06:54.027
<font color="#00FFFF"> Stop him asking awkward questions.</font>

06:54.028 --> 06:57.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> When that didn't work, she bought
him a pair of Adidas trainers.</font>

06:57.360 --> 06:58.360
<font color="#00FFFF"> He may not know much about girls,</font>

06:58.361 --> 07:00.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> but at least he can run
away from them.</font>

07:00.360 --> 07:04.359
The twins have started
sex education at school.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> Good. </font>It's not good.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.359
They should be waiting until
they're much, much older.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.894
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah, let's not tell kids
about all that kind of stuff</font>

07:10.895 --> 07:14.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> until they're into their
second or third pregnancy.</font>

07:14.360 --> 07:17.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> They don't want any spoilers,
do they?</font>

07:17.628 --> 07:20.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> Why don't you talk to the kids
about the facts of life?</font>

07:20.360 --> 07:22.359
Because I don't want
them knowing about it.

07:22.360 --> 07:25.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, sounds like they're going
to know, whether you like it or not.</font>

07:25.360 --> 07:28.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> You might feel better
if it comes from you first.</font>

07:28.360 --> 07:30.894
<font color="#00FFFF"> And if they've only
just started the lessons,</font>

07:30.895 --> 07:35.360
<font color="#00FFFF"> they might not have been told about
all the messy, squelchy bits yet.</font>

07:37.360 --> 07:39.360
Are you definitely a doctor?

07:41.162 --> 07:42.894
<font color="#00FFFF"> What did your dad tell you
when you were a kid?</font>

07:42.895 --> 07:44.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm assuming he gave you the talk.</font>

07:44.360 --> 07:47.359
My dad? He only taught me
two things about sex.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.359
One was to always check for
wedding rings and escape routes

07:50.360 --> 07:52.359
and the other was
something about Coca-Cola,

07:52.360 --> 07:54.360
which I now know to be bullshit.

07:58.360 --> 08:00.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> So are you going to talk to them?</font>

08:00.360 --> 08:01.360
Yeah, why not?

08:01.361 --> 08:04.360
I'm sure I can do this in a mature
and intelligent way.

08:04.361 --> 08:07.359
Do you think I should get puppets?

08:07.360 --> 08:08.360
<font color="#00FFFF"> Might be a bit much.</font>

08:16.360 --> 08:17.627
So where were we up to?

08:17.628 --> 08:23.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> There's a mummy and a daddy and
they love each other very much.</font>

08:23.360 --> 08:26.359
Right. We're still only there,
are we?

08:26.360 --> 08:31.359
So, when they decide
they want to have a baby,

08:31.360 --> 08:33.359
the mummy lies...

08:33.360 --> 08:35.027
<font color="#00FFFF"> She tells lies?</font>

08:35.028 --> 08:36.359
No, no.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.760
She lies down next to the man.

08:39.094 --> 08:41.692
Although I have had a woman
lie to me in bed.

08:41.693 --> 08:44.692
I say woman -
turns out it was a man.

08:44.693 --> 08:46.692
Know your audience, Lee.

08:46.693 --> 08:50.693
So, the woman lies down
next to the man and...

08:52.694 --> 08:55.627
..this next bit is going
to sound a little bit odd,

08:55.628 --> 08:58.692
but they love each other very much,
so you've got to factor that in.

08:58.693 --> 09:00.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> You've already said
they love each other.</font>

09:00.693 --> 09:03.227
<font color="#FFFF00"> Right, and they're married -
did I mention that? </font>Yes.</font>

09:03.228 --> 09:05.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> To each other. Was that clear? </font>Yes.</font>

09:05.693 --> 09:06.826
Good.

09:06.827 --> 09:09.692
And they've got a mortgage

09:09.693 --> 09:12.693
and they've got rid of his old van

09:12.694 --> 09:18.692
and exchanged it for a nice sensible
five-door Skoda, so they are ready.

09:18.693 --> 09:20.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> Ready for what?</font>

09:22.693 --> 09:23.693
To have a baby.

09:23.694 --> 09:25.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> And how do they do that?</font>

09:25.693 --> 09:27.693
Well, they...

09:29.693 --> 09:32.693
..have a lie down together and...

09:35.094 --> 09:38.227
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, nine
months later, the mummy has a baby.

09:38.228 --> 09:40.692
Right, who wants to play on the PS4?

09:40.693 --> 09:42.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> But how does the baby
get inside the mummy?</font>

09:44.228 --> 09:45.960
<font color="#FFFF00"> Right. </font>Do you know?</font>

09:45.961 --> 09:47.692
Yes.

09:47.693 --> 09:50.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> Tell us where babies come from.</font>

09:52.693 --> 09:55.692
You know puppies?
<font color="#FFFF00"> Are we getting a puppy? </font>No.

09:55.693 --> 09:57.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Mummies make puppies? </font>No.

09:57.693 --> 10:02.692
When a daddy dog and a mummy dog
love each other very much...

10:02.693 --> 10:04.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Can dogs get married?</font>

10:04.693 --> 10:06.692
Yeah, sure.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> How do their little
top hats stay on?</font>

10:08.693 --> 10:10.692
Never mind that.

10:10.693 --> 10:14.692
When the daddy dog and the mummy dog
want to have a puppy,

10:14.693 --> 10:18.692
they go into the kennel together.

10:18.693 --> 10:21.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> And then what happens?</font>

10:21.693 --> 10:23.692
Well, the daddy dog,

10:23.693 --> 10:28.361
he is very excited
about being in there.

10:29.693 --> 10:30.693
And so he...

10:34.693 --> 10:37.627
Actually, it's worse using dogs,
let's go back to humans.

10:37.628 --> 10:39.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> This is so boring.</font>

10:39.693 --> 10:41.692
Exactly. It's really boring.

10:41.693 --> 10:44.093
You won't have to worry about it
for a very long time. It's like...

10:44.094 --> 10:48.692
Erm, I don't know, what's really
boring that only grown-ups like?

10:48.693 --> 10:50.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> Ikea. </font>Perfect example.

10:50.693 --> 10:51.693
It's like Ikea.

10:51.694 --> 10:54.494
Nobody wants to go to Ikea,
it's really boring.

10:54.495 --> 10:57.693
But when you're older,
much older, and your body...

10:58.693 --> 11:02.692
..changes and is ready
to go to Ikea,

11:02.693 --> 11:07.692
you'll suddenly be really
interested in going to Ikea.

11:07.693 --> 11:09.692
You'll be wanting to go
to Ikea every night.

11:09.693 --> 11:12.692
Sometimes two or three
times a night.

11:12.693 --> 11:15.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> Is that where you get
the seeds from - Ikea?</font>

11:17.361 --> 11:21.093
<font color="#00FFFF"> What? </font>My friend Amy said you
need seeds to make a baby.</font>

11:21.094 --> 11:24.960
<font color="#00FFFF"> Right. </font>Well, do you get
the seeds from Ikea?</font>

11:24.961 --> 11:26.692
Of course not.

11:26.693 --> 11:29.495
<font color="#FFFF00"> So where do the seeds come from?</font>

11:31.694 --> 11:33.827
Oh, B&amp;Q.

11:35.693 --> 11:36.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> B&amp;Q?</font>

11:36.694 --> 11:39.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Making a baby sounds
like way too much shopping.</font>

11:39.693 --> 11:41.360
You're right.

11:41.361 --> 11:44.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> I wouldn't worry about it
for a very long time. </font>We won't.</font>

11:44.693 --> 11:46.692
And what's the most important thing
about this little chat

11:46.693 --> 11:47.960
that I said
right at the start?

11:47.961 --> 11:50.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> That mummies and daddies
love each other very much</font>

11:50.693 --> 11:53.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> and we are a very special
miracle of that love.</font>

11:53.694 --> 11:55.826
No, not that. The other thing.

11:55.827 --> 11:58.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> Don't tell Mum we had this chat?</font>

11:58.693 --> 11:59.693
That's the one.

11:59.694 --> 12:01.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Can we get a puppy?</font>

12:01.693 --> 12:03.693
Oh, whatever you want.

12:10.693 --> 12:13.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Did she say why she wanted
to see us again? </font>No.</font>

12:13.693 --> 12:15.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> She just said there'd
been some disruption</font>

12:15.693 --> 12:18.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> in the sex education class and she
wanted to talk to us one-to-one.</font>

12:18.693 --> 12:22.495
Well, maybe I should go,
otherwise it will be two-to-one.

12:23.693 --> 12:26.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> So, where to begin?</font>

12:26.693 --> 12:30.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> Even before today's lesson on
reproduction we had problems.</font>

12:30.693 --> 12:34.360
<font color="#FFFF00"> During story time, a boy and girl
lay down next to one another</font>

12:34.361 --> 12:37.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> and Molly made them sit up in
case the girl got pregnant.</font>

12:37.693 --> 12:40.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> What, she thought if a boy lies down
next to a girl she'll have a baby?</font>

12:40.693 --> 12:41.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> No.</font>

12:41.694 --> 12:44.361
<font color="#FFFF00"> She thinks she'll have puppies.</font>

12:46.693 --> 12:49.360
<font color="#FFFF00"> And when I showed the class
this diagram,</font>

12:49.361 --> 12:52.227
<font color="#FFFF00"> Benji said I wasn't allowed to show
the class one of these</font>

12:52.228 --> 12:54.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> until they'd all bought
a five-door Skoda.</font>

12:59.693 --> 13:01.693
Kids, eh?
Where do they get this stuff?

13:02.693 --> 13:06.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, don't look at me.</font>
They said from their father.</font>

13:06.693 --> 13:09.093
All right, now you can look at me.

13:09.094 --> 13:10.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well?</font>

13:10.693 --> 13:12.692
Look, I just thought,
as a good parent,

13:12.693 --> 13:14.692
I should be the one telling them
about the facts of life.

13:14.693 --> 13:16.360
<font color="#00FFFF"> Without discussing it with me first?</font>

13:16.361 --> 13:19.692
I said I was a good parent,
I didn't say I was a good husband.

13:19.693 --> 13:23.494
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, your use of euphemism and
metaphor has given them quite</font>

13:23.495 --> 13:25.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> a vividly inaccurate idea
of human reproduction.</font>

13:25.693 --> 13:27.692
All right, I didn't use
all the right words,

13:27.693 --> 13:29.093
but what was I supposed to do?

13:29.094 --> 13:31.692
Take this home and go, "Oh,
look, kids, it's a vagina"?

13:31.693 --> 13:33.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, you definitely
shouldn't have done that.</font>

13:33.693 --> 13:35.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> Exactly. </font>Because that is the vulva.</font>

13:38.693 --> 13:40.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> The vagina is the muscular canal</font>

13:40.693 --> 13:42.227
<font color="#FFFF00"> that connects the vulva
to the uterus.</font>

13:42.228 --> 13:44.227
Look, I might not know
all the right words,

13:44.228 --> 13:45.692
but I know enough
to teach the basics.

13:45.693 --> 13:47.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Are you sure about that? </font>Yes.

13:47.693 --> 13:51.627
You know, the eggs and
the seeds and all that.

13:51.628 --> 13:52.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> OK.</font>

13:52.693 --> 13:54.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> So where do the eggs come from?</font>

13:54.693 --> 13:55.693
What?

13:56.693 --> 13:58.826
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm just checking you know
the basics.</font>

13:58.827 --> 14:01.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> You know, make sure we're teaching
the same curriculum.</font>

14:01.693 --> 14:04.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> So where do the eggs come from?</font>

14:04.694 --> 14:06.228
The woman.

14:07.693 --> 14:08.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well done.</font>

14:08.694 --> 14:10.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> Can you be more specific?</font>

14:10.693 --> 14:12.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> Whereabouts in the woman?</font>

14:12.693 --> 14:14.692
You know...

14:14.693 --> 14:16.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> I know, yes, do you?</font>

14:18.693 --> 14:19.693
The tummy.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> The tummy?</font>

14:21.694 --> 14:23.693
The egg dispenser.

14:25.827 --> 14:28.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> You mean the ovary?</font>
That's what I meant.

14:28.693 --> 14:31.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> And of course, they travel
from the ovary to the uterus,</font>

14:31.693 --> 14:33.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> via the...</font>

14:35.693 --> 14:36.961
<font color="#FFFF00"> What are these called?</font>

14:40.693 --> 14:42.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> F... </font>F...

14:42.694 --> 14:45.494
<font color="#00FFFF"> F... </font>Filipino.

14:45.495 --> 14:46.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, God.</font>

14:47.693 --> 14:48.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> And this?</font>

14:50.694 --> 14:53.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> How the hell did you
ever get me pregnant?</font>

14:53.693 --> 14:56.627
This is ridiculous, you don't
need to know the name

14:56.628 --> 14:58.692
of all the engine parts to
teach a child how to drive.

14:58.693 --> 15:00.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> And why are you teaching
them to drive?</font>

15:00.693 --> 15:04.826
<font color="#FFFF00"> Is that so they can nip out and buy
the seeds to get the woman pregnant?</font>

15:04.827 --> 15:07.628
<font color="#FFFF00"> You know, from B&amp;Q?</font>

15:15.693 --> 15:17.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> You absolute knobhead.</font>

15:20.827 --> 15:23.628
Don't you mean penis cranium?

15:25.693 --> 15:28.692
I'm not happy about her attitude,
I'm taking this to the head.

15:28.693 --> 15:30.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Knowing your anatomical knowledge,</font>

15:30.693 --> 15:32.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> you'll mistakenly take
it to the arse.</font>

15:32.693 --> 15:35.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Talk about the blind
leading the blind.</font>

15:35.693 --> 15:38.227
What's that supposed to mean?

15:38.228 --> 15:39.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well...</font>

15:39.693 --> 15:42.692
I might not know my technical
gubbins, but I know where all

15:42.693 --> 15:44.692
the important bits are
and what you do with them.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.693
Don't I?

15:51.693 --> 15:53.692
Don't I?

15:53.693 --> 15:55.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> Sometimes.</font>

15:56.693 --> 15:58.692
Sometimes?

15:58.693 --> 16:01.093
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, let's put it this way...</font>

16:01.094 --> 16:03.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> If you were a postman
delivering a package,</font>

16:03.693 --> 16:06.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> you know where the front door is,
but you're not exactly clear</font>

16:06.693 --> 16:08.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> on the location of the bell.</font>

16:15.693 --> 16:18.227
Where exactly is this bell?

16:18.228 --> 16:22.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> About half an inch from where
you've been jabbing away.</font>

16:24.827 --> 16:27.693
Well, maybe next time
I'll leave it behind the bins.

16:27.694 --> 16:29.692
So why haven't you said
anything before?

16:29.693 --> 16:33.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, you're just so coy when
it comes to talking about sex.</font>

16:33.693 --> 16:35.692
I talk about sex.

16:35.693 --> 16:38.227
<font color="#00FFFF"> Talking about sex is not, "Come on,
Lucy, we've got ten minutes</font>

16:38.228 --> 16:39.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> "before Deliveroo arrives."</font>

16:42.361 --> 16:43.693
Well, he always knocks.

16:44.827 --> 16:48.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> What? </font>I'm just saying, I'm not the
only one who can't find the bell.

16:48.693 --> 16:50.692
So how come if I don't
know what I'm doing,

16:50.693 --> 16:52.692
you always sound like
you're enjoying yourself?

16:52.693 --> 16:55.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, you know... </font>No, tell me.

16:55.693 --> 16:58.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, sometimes it's real
and sometimes...</font>

17:00.693 --> 17:01.693
You're faking it?

17:03.361 --> 17:05.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, not all the time but,
you know, sometimes I'm tired</font>

17:05.693 --> 17:09.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> and you're in a rush because
you want to watch Line Of Duty.</font>

17:10.827 --> 17:12.692
I don't believe this.

17:12.693 --> 17:15.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Look, I don't always have time
to help you with all the moves.</font>

17:15.693 --> 17:17.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Up, down, left a bit, right a bit.</font>

17:17.693 --> 17:19.692
Sorry, are we still talking
about making love?

17:19.693 --> 17:23.692
Or winning on the grabber machine
at Blackpool Pleasure Beach?

17:23.693 --> 17:26.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Look, there's more to being a good
husband than just sex, you know.</font>

17:26.693 --> 17:27.693
Like what?

17:27.694 --> 17:29.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Grouting.</font>

17:29.693 --> 17:30.960
Grouting?

17:30.961 --> 17:32.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah.</font>

17:32.628 --> 17:33.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> You're excellent at that.</font>

17:33.693 --> 17:36.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> And that's something
I can't do for myself.</font>

17:41.693 --> 17:43.692
Sorry?

17:43.693 --> 17:48.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, what do you think I'm doing
while you're watching Line Of Duty?</font>

17:52.693 --> 17:56.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> But they only saw it
on the X-ray ten days later.</font>

17:57.693 --> 17:58.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> What's up with you?</font>

17:58.694 --> 18:01.093
<font color="#00FFFF"> You normally love my
anecdotes about surgeons</font>

18:01.094 --> 18:03.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> accidentally leaving
tools inside people.</font>

18:06.628 --> 18:08.692
You know what we were
talking about before -

18:08.693 --> 18:11.628
you know, sex?

18:14.693 --> 18:16.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> You know it's worse if you whisper?</font>

18:16.693 --> 18:19.093
<font color="#00FFFF"> It makes everyone more interested
in what you're saying.</font>

18:19.094 --> 18:21.693
Perhaps you should start
whispering your anecdotes.

18:25.693 --> 18:29.360
Do you ever worry that
you don't quite know as much

18:29.361 --> 18:32.494
about sex as you thought you did?

18:32.495 --> 18:35.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> Did Pointless do a round
on erogenous zones?</font>

18:37.693 --> 18:40.692
I always thought I had a good handle
on the way women's bodies work.

18:40.693 --> 18:44.494
I'd done all the research in various
bus shelters when I was a teenager.

18:44.495 --> 18:47.692
Turns out I might not be
all that in the bedroom.

18:47.693 --> 18:50.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> Maybe you should try it
in the bus shelter.</font>

18:51.693 --> 18:52.826
I'm finding this difficult enough -

18:52.827 --> 18:55.360
can you not just use it
as an opportunity to mock me?

18:55.361 --> 18:56.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> And what did she say to that?</font>

18:58.694 --> 19:01.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Sorry, carry on. I won't laugh.</font>

19:01.693 --> 19:03.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> Actually, is that what she says?</font>
Forget it.

19:03.694 --> 19:05.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> Look, no, sorry. Look, sit down.</font>

19:06.693 --> 19:09.494
<font color="#00FFFF"> You've never mentioned this before.</font>

19:09.495 --> 19:11.692
I never knew, did I?

19:11.693 --> 19:16.692
Turns out, sometimes
Lucy... fakes it.

19:16.693 --> 19:19.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, there's nothing wrong
if it's sometimes.</font>

19:19.693 --> 19:21.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's the same in my
marriage, as well.</font>

19:21.693 --> 19:23.692
Anna sometimes fakes it?

19:23.693 --> 19:26.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, I sometimes fake it.</font>

19:27.693 --> 19:31.227
<font color="#00FFFF"> I can't keep going like I used to.
My back isn't what it was.</font>

19:31.228 --> 19:34.360
Well, you'd feel different
if it was the other way round.

19:34.361 --> 19:37.093
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I suppose that might help
keep my spine straight.</font>

19:37.094 --> 19:39.692
I mean, if Anna was doing
the faking.

19:39.693 --> 19:41.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, she probably is sometimes.</font>

19:41.693 --> 19:44.360
Oh, I don't know. Anna strikes me
as the kind of person

19:44.361 --> 19:45.693
whose moans are always genuine.

19:47.693 --> 19:50.360
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I think you're worrying
unnecessarily, but if you feel</font>

19:50.361 --> 19:52.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> really strongly about it,
it's never too late to learn.</font>

19:52.693 --> 19:54.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> Learn? </font>I can help you.</font>

19:58.693 --> 20:01.692
I'm not wearing a wig.

20:01.693 --> 20:04.494
<font color="#00FFFF"> Here's a list of books and DVDs.</font>

20:04.495 --> 20:07.494
<font color="#00FFFF"> How come you know all this stuff?</font>
Homework from Anna.</font>

20:07.495 --> 20:10.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> She doesn't like any wishy-washy
time-wasting in that department.</font>

20:10.693 --> 20:13.093
<font color="#00FFFF"> I do my research, I have a map.</font>

20:13.094 --> 20:16.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Clearly delineated targets
for a bombardment.</font>

20:16.693 --> 20:19.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> And a clear exit strategy.</font>

20:19.693 --> 20:22.694
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm the Andy McNab
of clinical lovemaking.</font>

20:24.628 --> 20:26.693
Blimey, does she make
you wear a balaclava?

20:30.693 --> 20:32.693
Please don't answer that.

MUSIC: Let's Do It
(Let's Fall In Love) by Rudy Vallee

20:38.693 --> 20:43.227
# Let's do it, let's fall in love

20:43.228 --> 20:46.692
# In Spain the best upper sets do it

20:46.693 --> 20:49.692
# Lithuanians and Letts do it

20:49.693 --> 20:53.692
# Let's do it, let's fall in love

20:53.693 --> 20:58.692
# The Dutch in old Amsterdam do
it... #

20:58.693 --> 21:02.360
BUZZING

21:02.361 --> 21:04.692
# Think of Siamese twins

21:04.693 --> 21:07.692
# Those Argentines
without means do it

21:07.693 --> 21:10.692
# People say in Boston
even beans do it

21:10.693 --> 21:15.692
# Let's do it, let's fall in love

21:15.693 --> 21:18.692
# Sponges, they say, do it

21:18.693 --> 21:21.692
# Oysters down in Oyster Bay do it

21:21.693 --> 21:25.692
# Let's do it, let's fall in love

21:25.693 --> 21:29.692
# Cold Cape Cod clams,
'gainst their wish, do it

21:29.693 --> 21:32.360
# Even lazy jellyfish do it

21:32.361 --> 21:36.692
# Let's do it, let's fall in love

21:36.693 --> 21:39.826
# Electric eels, I might add, do it

21:39.827 --> 21:42.692
# Though it shocks 'em, I know

21:42.693 --> 21:46.692
# Let's do it, let's fall in love

21:46.693 --> 21:50.692
# And all sedate barnyard fowls
do it

21:50.693 --> 21:53.692
# When a chanticleer cries

21:53.693 --> 21:55.692
# Old high-hat owls do it

21:55.693 --> 21:57.826
# And they're supposed to be wise

21:57.827 --> 22:01.227
# The longest worms
on the walks do it

22:01.228 --> 22:04.360
# Even little cuckoos
in their clocks do it... #

22:04.361 --> 22:05.692

MUSIC: Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus
by Serge Gainsbourg

22:21.693 --> 22:23.360
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well done.</font>

22:23.361 --> 22:26.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, that really is quite remarkable.</font>

22:26.693 --> 22:28.692
Yeah, all right, David Coleman.

22:28.693 --> 22:30.826
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, oh! That's new.</font>

22:30.827 --> 22:33.692
What, the body part
or what I'm doing to it?

22:33.693 --> 22:34.826
<font color="#00FFFF"> What you're doing to it.</font>

22:34.827 --> 22:37.692
Thank God for that.
I thought I'd found a growth.

22:37.693 --> 22:41.360
<font color="#00FFFF"> I couldn't have done it better
myself.</font>

22:41.361 --> 22:42.692
Oh, hang on a minute.

22:42.693 --> 22:44.693
It's getting a bit hot in here.

22:50.361 --> 22:52.693
I couldn't do an eight-hour
shift in this.

22:54.693 --> 22:57.692
Tell me, honestly,
that thing we did before...

22:57.693 --> 22:59.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> What, with the thing? </font>Yeah.

22:59.694 --> 23:01.692
With the thing...

23:01.693 --> 23:04.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Were they real noises
you were making? </font>Oh, yes.</font>

23:04.693 --> 23:06.692
Oh, wow.

23:06.693 --> 23:08.693
I thought you had fur balls.

23:09.827 --> 23:11.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> Wait.</font>

23:13.228 --> 23:16.692
Don't worry, I've got a spare jar
for the kids' breakfast.

23:16.693 --> 23:18.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> The bedroom door.</font>

23:18.693 --> 23:20.361
<font color="#00FFFF"> Was it open before?</font>

23:26.961 --> 23:30.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> I expect you're wondering why
I've called you in again.</font>

23:30.693 --> 23:33.093
<font color="#00FFFF"> No idea.</font>

23:33.094 --> 23:34.692
Me neither.

23:34.693 --> 23:36.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> Your children have been...</font>

23:36.693 --> 23:38.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> ..joining in in class again.</font>

23:41.628 --> 23:44.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> I wrote it down to capture
all the lovely details.</font>

23:44.693 --> 23:47.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Would you like to hear
what they said? </font>Is it necessary?</font>

23:48.693 --> 23:51.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> We're more than happy
to just consider expulsion.</font>

23:53.827 --> 23:56.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> "When a mummy and daddy
love each other very much</font>

23:56.693 --> 23:58.494
<font color="#FFFF00"> "and want to make a baby,</font>

23:58.495 --> 24:00.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> "the daddy wears
a funny rubber face mask...</font>

24:02.693 --> 24:07.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> "..the mummy handcuffs him
to the bed so he can't run away,</font>

24:07.693 --> 24:10.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> "then the mummy puts on some
rubber gloves and tells him off</font>

24:10.693 --> 24:12.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> "for being very, very naughty."</font>

24:14.495 --> 24:16.693
Well, that's the last time
they watch CBeebies.

24:18.693 --> 24:23.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> There's a lot more, some of it
really quite impressive.</font>

24:23.693 --> 24:25.360
<font color="#FFFF00"> I don't know where a mummy and daddy</font>

24:25.361 --> 24:27.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> would get fresh asparagus
out of season.</font>

24:29.693 --> 24:33.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> I think maybe the twins
must have been speaking to... others.</font>

24:34.693 --> 24:37.692
Vegetarians, by the sound of it.

24:37.693 --> 24:40.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> I don't think we can blame
the vegetarians.</font>

24:40.693 --> 24:42.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> A saveloy was also mentioned.</font>

24:47.693 --> 24:49.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Did the twins seem upset
by all of this?</font>

24:49.693 --> 24:51.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> More confused than anything.</font>

24:51.693 --> 24:56.093
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Although Molly was a little
concerned about one thing. </font>What?</font>

24:56.094 --> 25:00.628
<font color="#FFFF00"> Apparently, some mummies keep
a rabbit in their bedside drawer.</font>

25:02.693 --> 25:05.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> And she's worried it'll suffocate.</font>

25:06.693 --> 25:08.693
If she's worried
it'll suffocate in there,

25:08.694 --> 25:11.693
it's a good job she doesn't know
where it's headed next.

25:14.693 --> 25:16.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, we're sorry that they
interrupted the class,</font>

25:16.693 --> 25:18.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> and we'll talk to them.</font>

25:18.693 --> 25:21.692
<font color="#00FFFF">Please do.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00"> I think perhaps we should go.</font>

25:21.693 --> 25:22.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> Of course.</font>

25:22.694 --> 25:26.693
<font color="#FFFF00"> You're clearly very... busy people.</font>

25:41.693 --> 25:44.692
All I wanted to do was protect
the children's innocence

25:44.693 --> 25:46.692
and I've ended up doing
the complete opposite.

25:46.693 --> 25:48.494
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, don't worry.</font>

25:48.495 --> 25:50.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> We put the kids straight
with our little chat.</font>

25:50.693 --> 25:53.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> And anyway, it's good that we faced
up to it and talked to them</font>

25:53.693 --> 25:55.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> in a sensible and grown-up way.</font>

25:55.693 --> 25:58.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> By pretending we were
playing cops and robbers? </font>Yes.</font>

25:59.693 --> 26:04.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Daddy had just stolen Mummy's
big pink electric toothbrush,</font>

26:04.628 --> 26:08.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> so she arrested him and sentenced
him to a great big tickle fight.</font>

26:08.693 --> 26:12.627
And Mummy stubbed her toe and that's
why she was making all those noises.

26:12.628 --> 26:15.961
<font color="#00FFFF"> And why she had to put her toe
in... in Daddy's mouth.</font>

26:17.693 --> 26:20.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> Maybe we should also pretend
that I stubbed my... </font>No.</font>

26:22.693 --> 26:24.227
Oh, well.

26:24.228 --> 26:26.692
There is one silver lining.

26:26.693 --> 26:28.693
At least the postman knows
where the doorbell is now.

26:28.694 --> 26:32.692
<font color="#FFFF00"> And anyway, I'm sorry
about all of that. </font>How do you mean?

26:32.693 --> 26:35.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I might have slightly
exaggerated your fumbling</font>

26:35.693 --> 26:36.693
<font color="#00FFFF"> because I was cross with you</font>

26:36.694 --> 26:38.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> for talking to the kids
without telling me.</font>

26:38.693 --> 26:40.693
So I was never that bad
in the first place?

26:40.694 --> 26:42.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> Not really.</font>

26:42.693 --> 26:45.692
<font color="#00FFFF"> In fact, it's your grouting
that's actually rubbish.</font>

26:45.693 --> 26:47.693
I'll take that.

26:50.693 --> 26:52.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Lock the door.</font>

26:52.628 --> 26:53.693
Oh, yeah.

26:57.693 --> 26:59.692
# We're not going out

26:59.693 --> 27:00.826
# Not staying in

27:00.827 --> 27:04.692
# Just hanging around
with my head in a spin

27:04.693 --> 27:06.826
# But there's no need
to scream and shout

27:06.827 --> 27:10.692
# We're not going out

27:10.693 --> 27:13.693
# We are not going out. #
