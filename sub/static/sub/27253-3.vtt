01:20.480 --> 01:23.840
-We are in serious trouble, Cosimo.
-We have run the bank from Trebbio before.

01:23.920 --> 01:25.920
-That's not the point.
-Stefano, hide it well.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.720
We owe more than we have
and there will be no trade now.

01:28.800 --> 01:29.720
Help Mother along.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.360
All this fussings.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.480
Since when did the rich
become such cowards?

01:35.560 --> 01:38.720
-Just get on, Mother.
-Yes, yes, yes.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.240
The city guard will raise the cordon
any moment. We must go.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.640
Get on board.
I'll be with you in a moment.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.520
L.C.

01:50.600 --> 01:54.560
The dagger that killed Tancredi
belongs to Lupo Corona.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.280
He's a friend of the Albizzi.
He would have no love from my father.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.160
The Coronas are staying in Florence.

01:59.240 --> 02:02.720
The horses were still unbridled
in the stables when I came here.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.000
Once the cordon is raised, you will
not be able to leave the city, Marco.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.680
The plague will be sick of me,
not I of it.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.160
People don't tend to get it twice.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.920
- Be careful, my friend.
- I will!

02:15.000 --> 02:16.120
Messer Cosimo.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.040
Ricciardo, what are you doing here?
You need to leave the city.

02:19.120 --> 02:23.280
-We have nowhere to go.
-Cosimo! Come on!

02:23.360 --> 02:25.520
We want to keep on working,
my builders and I.

02:25.600 --> 02:30.600
We want to finish your dome. I only ask
that you continue to pay for our work.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.440
If God wills us to die,

02:32.520 --> 02:35.960
at least let our families
not die in hunger.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.800
Please, Messer Cosimo.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.880
God found cause to send us this plague.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.840
Perhaps with this,
you will give him cause to end it.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.120
My father gave me this.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.920
It will protect you.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.840
God go with you, Messer.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.560
Thank you for coming at this inhuman hour.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.360
We shall be quick. Rations will be halved.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.640
The people will have to manage
as best they can.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.680
We should have left the city.

03:45.760 --> 03:49.640
- And surrender this opportunity?
- Order!

03:51.040 --> 03:53.360
Signor Albizzi.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.120
- I know how uncertain you must feel.

03:58.200 --> 04:03.520
This plague is God's anger
at Florence's sins.

04:03.600 --> 04:09.080
And as leaders of Florence,
we are responsible for those sins.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.800
Where is Cosimo de' Medici?

04:18.880 --> 04:22.120
Cosimo is not alone in his absence,
Signor Albizzi.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.160
But it is his sin that has wrought
this anguish upon our city!

04:25.240 --> 04:27.600
--We can't let you leave the city.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.800
You have to stand back!
Stand back!

04:29.880 --> 04:32.920
How does Cosimo afford his dome, hmm?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.840
Usury! A sin!

04:35.920 --> 04:39.160
And to build this dome
with a usurer's coin,

04:39.240 --> 04:40.760
is just as great a sin!

04:43.040 --> 04:44.480
No! No!

04:44.560 --> 04:46.680
I'm telling you! Stand back, get back!

04:49.920 --> 04:51.440
Don't.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.280
We must expel Cosimo de' Medici
from the Signoria

04:57.360 --> 04:59.320
and seize all documents
pertaining to his wealth,

04:59.400 --> 05:03.760
so we may fully investigate
these charges of usury and corruption.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.240
Your charges.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.680
No gold to be taken out of the city.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.760
Signor Guadagni...

05:15.840 --> 05:19.920
what we witness now is the consequence
of exempting the powerful

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
from the law of God.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.720
Well, I'd hate to go against the Signoria.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.560
Perhaps you can look after this for me.

05:35.200 --> 05:40.200
If we have a sinner in our midst,
he should be treated so accordingly.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.520
Of course, Messer de' Medici.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.080
You are a credit to your Masters, captain.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.320
We are all sinners, signor Albizzi.

05:51.640 --> 05:54.760
And I am yet to meet a banker
who has not been accused of usury.

05:56.520 --> 05:57.720
Drive on!

05:59.720 --> 06:03.080
Stand back! Open the gate!

06:03.160 --> 06:04.160
Get back!

06:11.280 --> 06:14.560
Our Priori number too few
to take a vote on this matter.

06:14.640 --> 06:18.000
--This house is in recess! Dismissed!

06:32.360 --> 06:35.080
Every man here has some stake
in Medici's fiefdom.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.040
We won't move against him,
not without cause.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.360
They do not see Cosimo for what he is.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.120
Nor seen how low he can stoop.

06:46.040 --> 06:50.920
We are all at the mercy of the mob.
At present they love Cosimo.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.800
Change that, and one by one,
his followers will fall away.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.840
Like scales from a snake.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.720
Cosimo, we have barely enough
funds to pay off a cheap whore.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.400
What are you going to tell the Pope?

07:12.480 --> 07:14.960
Or our creditors for that matter?

07:16.200 --> 07:21.440
Did you just expect them to wait
while you toss more money into loans,

07:21.520 --> 07:23.840
eh, artists, into the duomo...

07:23.920 --> 07:26.680
We keep our business steady,
we raise enough coin to repay our debts.

07:26.760 --> 07:29.520
War and plague have closed
every border from here to Venice.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.880
There is no business!

07:30.960 --> 07:33.280
We have promised loans to half
the merchants in the Papal states.

07:33.360 --> 07:36.440
If we sit and hoard our Florins,
we will loose their confidence.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.760
The Pope and his creditors
will pick the flesh from our bones.

07:39.840 --> 07:43.360
Look, I just don't see how we're going
to bring in any actual money...

07:43.440 --> 07:46.680
We are owed repayment on loan
from our sister bank in Siena.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.840
They have not been hit by plague.
They will be able to make good.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.680
--And it will be enough to tide us over,

07:55.760 --> 08:00.360
not enough to pay our debts in full,
but keep everyone sated at least

08:00.440 --> 08:02.960
until the plague is over
and the trade routes reopened.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.640
-You should have told me about this.
-I'm telling you now.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.080
Go to Siena. Speak to the owner Niccolo.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.560
Buy his silence if you have to,

08:11.640 --> 08:15.800
but remind him it is in everyone's
interest to keep the Medici bank afloat.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.120
Brother...

08:26.360 --> 08:27.360
Return with the coin.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.560
I wish you'd told me.

08:34.560 --> 08:35.640
What is our situation?

08:37.600 --> 08:41.120
- Twenty-thousand Florins.
- Twenty-thousand...

08:43.680 --> 08:45.640
-What do you suggest?
-Prioritize the loans.

08:46.800 --> 08:51.160
Pay each man a sum from 15,000,
rather than 20,000.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.680
We need something to live on ourselves.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.120
I'll write to the merchants
and tell them the money will be coming.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.200
Send word to the Pope
and our peace creditors.

09:00.480 --> 09:04.320
Would it not be wiser to wait
until the Siena's money is in our coffers?

09:04.400 --> 09:06.320
Lorenzo will not let us down.

09:50.520 --> 09:51.760
Corona!

10:17.640 --> 10:20.520
I'm not here to loot.
Where is your master?

10:20.600 --> 10:22.360
Where is he?

10:22.440 --> 10:24.280
He's upstairs.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.080
Go.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.400
- Corona!

10:54.000 --> 10:56.040
- Is this yours?

10:56.120 --> 10:58.880
Did you kill Tancredi with this?

10:58.960 --> 11:01.640
-Who poisoned Giovanni de' Medici?
-I didn't.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.600
Don't let your last words be lies.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.520
I didn't.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.800
- Who commanded you? Albizzi?

11:08.880 --> 11:10.880
- Speak, damn you! Speak!

11:22.640 --> 11:25.600
The vineyards are looking lovely,
Contessina.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.400
I was admiring them on our way here.

11:29.800 --> 11:30.800
Thank you.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.960
We used to walk through them together,
Giovanni and I.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.280
He would say a vine
was like a great family.

11:44.360 --> 11:47.880
It's worth determined
by the quality of its fruit.

11:47.960 --> 11:51.040
It was not he or the vine that mattered,

11:51.120 --> 11:53.960
but the grape what the vine leaves behind.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.880
Good thing he was a banker
and not a philosopher.

12:00.960 --> 12:04.640
- You must miss him very much.
- One has to stop missing people

12:04.720 --> 12:08.800
when you get to my age, dear.
Nothing would ever get done.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.640
Is it a boy?

12:10.720 --> 12:13.480
- It is hard to tell, Grandmother.
- Ugh. Nonsense.

12:13.560 --> 12:17.080
I knew I was carrying two boys
the moment I first conceived.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.680
Two boys?
Cosimo, I didn't know you were a twin.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.520
Forgive me. I was prying.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.080
-Don't you worry.
-Excuse me.

12:41.760 --> 12:45.360
Emilia, more wine.

12:45.440 --> 12:51.080
The Signoria does nothing!
Or why should they?

12:51.160 --> 12:55.960
Far easier for you to suffer
than for them to bring the tyrant

12:56.040 --> 12:58.960
who wrought this plague
upon you to justice!

13:00.320 --> 13:05.040
But every day
as Medici's impunity persists,

13:05.120 --> 13:07.240
so too does God's rage!

13:07.320 --> 13:10.760
- Medici says the dome is for God!

13:13.200 --> 13:16.520
The dome is for Cosimo.

13:17.720 --> 13:24.520
He tries to buy God like he buys men!
But God is not blind!

13:24.600 --> 13:30.360
Usury has funded this atrocity.

13:30.440 --> 13:33.120
Yes.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.280
And now Cosimo hides behind his gold

13:37.360 --> 13:41.920
and abandons you
to suffer the consequences!

13:49.440 --> 13:51.320
I beg you.

13:52.440 --> 13:58.440
Tear down the walls of this sinful dome,
denounce Cosimo de' Medici before God,

13:58.520 --> 14:04.160
and God will save you from this plague.

14:07.120 --> 14:11.960
I will feed and pay any man who does so.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.120
Lucrezia was not to know.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.120
Mother knew what she was saying.

14:47.080 --> 14:51.280
You must let go of this animosity.
Your mother is old.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.720
Don't let things end with her
the way they ended with your father.

14:54.800 --> 14:58.840
You can tell her if she's concerned
about dying without my affections,

14:58.920 --> 15:01.320
she can beg my forgiveness
whenever she chooses.

15:07.560 --> 15:08.840
Contessina.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.200
You are not the only one
she's hurt, Cosimo.

15:28.440 --> 15:29.560
You're leaving?

15:30.560 --> 15:32.040
Father is sending me to Rome.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.400
-We're only just married.
-I'm sorry.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.000
-Will you see her?
-See who?

15:43.320 --> 15:44.360
Your woman from Rome.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.640
Who told you about her?

15:50.240 --> 15:51.280
Your mother.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.120
Do you love her?

15:59.680 --> 16:04.160
-You understood the circumstances of our--
-I do not ask to judge.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.320
I ask only to know you better.

16:17.840 --> 16:18.760
Why did you tell her?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.400
-Excuse me.
-Mother.

16:23.720 --> 16:27.000
- Why did you tell her?
- Piccarda, what is this about?

16:27.080 --> 16:29.880
She told my wife that I am still in love
with another woman.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.240
Why would you tell her?

16:32.320 --> 16:35.320
I told her it was possible
that your affections had not cooled.

16:35.400 --> 16:39.240
You've not conceived.
You work late to avoid her chamber.

16:39.320 --> 16:44.360
I was concerned, and I felt
that Contessina deserved an explanation.

16:44.440 --> 16:48.320
The explanation is I was not given leave
to marry a woman of my own choosing.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.960
Mind how you speak.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.760
And I have accepted that,
I will grow used to that,

16:52.840 --> 16:55.680
but, Mother, this was not concern,

16:55.760 --> 16:58.360
- this was sabotage.

16:58.440 --> 17:02.680
Cosimo, this family needs
your marriage to succeed.

17:02.760 --> 17:06.040
It depends on it.
No one's here to sabotage you.

17:06.120 --> 17:08.280
You conjure up these stories of injustice,

17:08.360 --> 17:10.800
so you never have to feel guilt
about your own failings.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.760
How could I feel no guilt?

17:14.720 --> 17:18.080
You may find new causes
to justify your dislike of me.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.360
But the truth is,
you've resented me since I was a boy.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.280
Because I should have been
the one to drown, not Damiano.

17:27.240 --> 17:31.680
Your twin brother was your responsibility,
as you were his.

17:33.200 --> 17:37.800
And you never said sorry. Not once.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.280
That was not your fault.

17:42.360 --> 17:43.360
It's all you ever said.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.640
I was just a boy.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.960
Even now.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.440
It's not my fault.

17:58.560 --> 18:01.600
I did not sabotage you.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.040
Your father requested that I intervene.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.880
You have not just inherited
a bank, Cosimo.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.160
You have inherited a family.

18:09.240 --> 18:12.360
Without them, everything your father
and I have built will disappear.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.560
So grow up.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.560
Take responsibility.

18:15.640 --> 18:20.600
You may be difficult to love,
but Contessina is prepared to do her duty.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.000
So you do yours.

18:23.840 --> 18:27.480
Legacies make great families, Cosimo.

18:27.560 --> 18:28.600
Not men.

18:28.680 --> 18:32.920
Never question your mother
like that again. Ever.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.000
- Cosimo!
- Marco!

19:12.120 --> 19:15.400
How did you escape the city?
Thank God you're alive.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.680
They are tearing down the dome.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.040
-On whose authority?
-Albizzi's.

19:18.120 --> 19:21.480
He tells the people
that it was paid for by usury.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.760
That if they renounce you
and tear it down,

19:23.840 --> 19:25.080
God will end this plague.

19:31.120 --> 19:33.400
I should have never left Florence.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.040
What are you doing?

19:35.120 --> 19:37.520
-Your place is here with your family.
-Father...

19:37.600 --> 19:40.240
If he can turn the people against me,
he can turn the Signoria

19:40.320 --> 19:43.400
-and if he does that, we are finished.
-Cosimo, I implore you.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.560
I can't stay here
and let him destroy everything

19:46.640 --> 19:48.840
-this family has fought to build.
-Cosimo...

19:54.720 --> 19:56.840
Lucrezia!

20:07.680 --> 20:08.880
We should all leave.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.880
Lucrezia and the baby are not safe here.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.680
You should keep as far
from this room as possible.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.680
-Mother, it's not enough.
-It will be enough.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.880
We cannot run. Not from a thing like this.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.080
Not from God.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.080
We stay together.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.200
Emilia will make up a chamber
in the east wing.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.720
You should not be in here.

20:33.760 --> 20:34.760
What will you do?

20:37.240 --> 20:38.600
I'm so sorry.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.800
-I came as soon as I heard.
-Where is the money?

21:09.440 --> 21:12.800
-It will come.
-I told you to bring it with you.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.800
Well, it would have taken
another five days to return.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.760
- You must be exhausted. Come and eat.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.120
Perhaps you were right about me, Mother.

22:00.640 --> 22:03.880
I am loosing our city, our bank,

22:05.360 --> 22:06.760
our family...

22:08.400 --> 22:09.720
Perhaps even God himself.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.240
I am failing your...

22:16.960 --> 22:18.960
"Grand Medici vine."

22:22.680 --> 22:24.760
I know you've always wanted me to say it.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.760
So if I can please you just once,

22:30.840 --> 22:33.080
then let it be with this.

22:34.360 --> 22:35.520
I am...

22:37.840 --> 22:39.320
I am sorry.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.320
Truly.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.880
I am always right, Cosimo.

23:03.120 --> 23:06.000
I have spent too long dreaming

23:07.640 --> 23:09.960
of the man Damiano might have become.

23:11.560 --> 23:17.200
And not enough time admiring the man
that you have become.

23:18.960 --> 23:23.680
You have become someone great, Cosimo.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.560
Neither of us have made things easy.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.560
But I am pleased with you.

23:34.280 --> 23:39.200
And I am proud of you.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.840
Go back, back to Florence.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.880
Don't wait around here for me to die.

23:54.320 --> 23:58.520
You can't save this family
from the Albizzi

23:58.600 --> 24:03.600
by being stuck in these wretched hills.

24:07.280 --> 24:11.560
Go home, Cosimo.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.360
Curse on you, Medici!
You caused this!

25:03.920 --> 25:07.640
No, you're not doing this! Leave it!

25:07.720 --> 25:09.680
Give it back! It's my work!

25:09.760 --> 25:12.760
- Come on. Move!

25:17.640 --> 25:19.280
Get off me!

25:26.480 --> 25:28.760
Sinner! You killed my son!

25:28.840 --> 25:34.200
- You killed my son!
- You killed my son!

25:43.920 --> 25:46.600
Where is Brunelleschi?

25:46.680 --> 25:48.920
Ricciardo?

25:49.000 --> 25:50.840
Albizzi!

25:50.920 --> 25:52.680
- Florence's prodigal God returns.
- Wait, Cosimo!

25:52.760 --> 25:56.120
You are desecrating a holy church!
Command these men to leave now!

25:56.200 --> 25:58.800
They wish to spare their families.
I won't order them not to.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.160
The dome is a monument
to faithful men like them.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.600
You twist its meaning!

26:03.680 --> 26:06.720
-You hide your motives behind the people!
-I do?

26:06.800 --> 26:09.640
Your family disguises itself
as the vox populi

26:09.720 --> 26:14.680
to sin without consequence, but the people
have seen the truth, Cosimo. Hmm?

26:14.760 --> 26:17.200
And now you will have consequences.

26:17.280 --> 26:21.000
Destroying the dome
will not end this plague!

26:21.080 --> 26:24.320
We are God's voice, God's hands!

26:24.400 --> 26:28.880
-He wills us to create in his name!
-Hey. Thinks he speaks for God!

26:28.960 --> 26:30.920
He thinks he speaks for you!

26:31.000 --> 26:33.760
- Usurer! Bastard! Sinner!
- Please, listen to me!

26:33.840 --> 26:36.800
Listen to me! Listen! Please!

26:46.360 --> 26:47.560
Step back!

26:47.640 --> 26:49.360
Fight the guards!

26:49.440 --> 26:51.880
Stand back! Let's go, Cosimo.

26:51.960 --> 26:55.240
- Let's go. Stand back!

26:58.600 --> 27:03.360
He's taunting me. Even now.
After everything he's done to my family.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.920
And as of today, we can see no end
to this present crisis.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.440
Yours, Bernardo Guadagni.

27:14.520 --> 27:18.000
-How could you let this happen?
-Ah, Cosimo.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.480
The Signoria cannot condone
what Albizzi is doing!

27:20.560 --> 27:23.280
Technically, the demolition of the dome
is the people's doing.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.560
Don't be a fool.
He plays them, like a pipe.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.800
What do you want me to do?
Arrest every man for civil disorder?

27:28.880 --> 27:30.880
The jails are as filled
with the sick as the hospitals,

27:30.960 --> 27:33.080
and even if they weren't,
I would lack support.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.800
Why? Surely the Signoria
can see his true intentions.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.400
They're tired of this infighting, Cosimo!

27:38.480 --> 27:40.480
They see this latest problem is yours,
not theirs.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.160
They have no love for your bloody dome.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.480
-This isn't about the dome!
-I know that.

27:44.560 --> 27:47.720
But if I force the Signoria
to move against Albizzi,

27:47.800 --> 27:51.360
the people could rise up against us
and we're in no state to quash a mob.

27:51.440 --> 27:52.760
I'm sorry, Cosimo.

27:52.840 --> 27:57.560
But my hands are tied. I cannot risk
causing further instability to Florence

27:57.640 --> 28:01.040
when it is already so close
to open revolt.

28:01.120 --> 28:04.080
Until this plague has ended,
the Signoria will not be able to help,

28:04.160 --> 28:07.880
and I advise you to keep the peace.

28:07.960 --> 28:12.480
Don't give Albizzi cause
to do you more harm in the Signoria.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.600
A courier from Siena.

29:06.760 --> 29:07.760
Plague in Siena.

29:08.920 --> 29:13.080
All the money was withdrawn
and the bank has collapsed.

29:17.720 --> 29:21.120
- It's like we've been cursed.
- You have to close the bank.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.800
Temporarily. We must seize trading
and save what we have

29:25.880 --> 29:28.440
if you want any hope of reopening,
once the plague has passed.

29:32.120 --> 29:36.040
-You would advise Cosimo the same?
-I would, yes.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.760
-But he would not agree.
-He would have other ideas.

29:40.840 --> 29:44.720
If we continue spending,
we'll become insolvent within the week.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.920
If we close now,
at least we're in control.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.920
What about the Pope's funds?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.880
We've already pilfered thousands
building the dome.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.640
We can't rob from Peter to pay Peter!

29:54.720 --> 29:57.840
Your only alternative
is to find an asset to sell.

29:57.920 --> 30:01.560
Valuable enough to attract a buyer,
but not so valuable as to ruin us.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.120
I need a day to think.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.120
Lorenzo, we don't have a day!

30:20.480 --> 30:22.280
Out here is no place for the sick.

30:22.360 --> 30:26.560
The hospitals are full.
The only place left is the street.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.920
It's here.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.640
Ricciardo?

30:43.880 --> 30:44.880
Messer Cosimo.

30:44.960 --> 30:49.040
You weren't at the church.
I was worried that--

30:52.000 --> 30:53.880
I'm so sorry, my friend.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.440
He said this would happen.

31:00.200 --> 31:03.480
Albizzi said it was a grave sin
to take your money.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.840
Do you believe him?

31:06.200 --> 31:07.720
Do you believe him?

31:10.680 --> 31:11.920
I don't know.

31:13.880 --> 31:17.800
If God does what he does,
it is not for me to explain.

31:27.840 --> 31:31.680
Giovanni, Giovanni.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.880
--Lucrezia.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.640
How much could we get for the wool mills?

33:00.720 --> 33:04.720
I think this is something
you should take up with Contessina.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.880
-The Pazzi have made offers in the past.
-And Cosimo refused every time.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.240
Neither he, nor Contessina
want those mills sold.

33:11.320 --> 33:13.480
Especially to the Pazzi of all people.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.920
Cosimo has never been in this position.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.760
Mother!

33:21.840 --> 33:23.240
You said it yourself!

33:23.320 --> 33:26.600
This is my only option,
and we need the money.

33:26.680 --> 33:29.240
Sell off the mills
for the amount that we need.

33:29.320 --> 33:32.320
Send a rider tonight.
The Pazzi villa isn't far.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.720
-You would go over my head.
-This is not your decision.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.480
My husband, your brother,
entrusted those mills to me.

33:37.560 --> 33:40.240
- This is my decision.
- Madonna.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.680
-Is it Mother?
-No, Messer. Madonna Lucrezia.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.480
She may lose her child.

33:48.640 --> 33:50.480
Is Albizzi right?

33:51.840 --> 33:55.560
- Other people being punished for my sins?
- No.

33:57.360 --> 34:01.840
- You are not a usurer.
- But I am other things.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.880
We have done other things.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.000
This is the work of a jealous noble.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.080
Not an angry God.

34:18.320 --> 34:24.440
Whatever Albizzi's intentions,
they do not make me blameless.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.680
They chose him
because they found me wanting.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.880
--Bastards!

34:31.320 --> 34:35.160
They want me to oversee
the deconstruction of the dome. My dome!

34:36.960 --> 34:39.160
Stupid, bloody ignorants.

34:40.560 --> 34:41.560
I refuse.

34:41.640 --> 34:46.320
Oh, but now, of course,
because of this, I'm in hiding.

34:50.640 --> 34:56.200
These shits survive and claim
they have been saved by God.

34:56.280 --> 34:58.880
But no one who says that deserves to be.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.720
If God should save anyone,
it should be the sick and poor.

35:04.280 --> 35:05.760
And me.

35:10.480 --> 35:13.120
Gather all the carts
and servants you can find.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.880
- Meet me at the church.
- What?

35:18.960 --> 35:20.440
Just do it.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.440
I'm sorry.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.520
What will happen to me
if I can't bear children?

35:47.080 --> 35:49.120
You will bear children.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.320
This happens to many women.

35:54.680 --> 35:59.760
But what if the only thing
you expect me to do is--

35:59.840 --> 36:02.640
Parents expect everything
from their children.

36:04.400 --> 36:08.880
And then they die,
and what they expect ceases to matter.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.280
One day, this family will fall to Piero.

36:14.280 --> 36:18.280
And he will need you
to keep him on course.

36:18.360 --> 36:22.600
Make yourself indispensable
and no one will find cause to exclude you.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.760
Believe me.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.400
And there are more ways
for a woman to be indispensable

36:39.480 --> 36:40.960
than in just bearing children.

36:55.120 --> 37:01.840
Lorenzo, Lorenzo.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.000
I'm here.

37:04.280 --> 37:07.880
-Cosimo?
-He's gone to Florence.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.840
Good.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.440
Piero.

37:17.760 --> 37:23.880
Name the child... "Giovanni,"

37:26.160 --> 37:28.880
after your grandfather.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.720
I will, Grandmother.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.840
Thank you, Father Daniele.
There's room over there by the nave.

38:16.960 --> 38:19.960
This is a kind thing you do,
Messer Cosimo.

38:20.040 --> 38:23.560
First they tear it down,
now you fill it with the plague.

38:23.640 --> 38:27.960
-What are you trying to tell me, Cosimo?
-Trust me, my friend.

38:32.400 --> 38:37.320
Medici brought the sick inside.
He's turned the church into a pesthouse.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.840
And the workers fear they will catch
the plague if they go inside.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.600
Medici!

38:48.680 --> 38:52.120
- Medici, come out here!

38:56.360 --> 38:58.480
Where is your master?

39:00.040 --> 39:01.040
With the sick!

39:02.080 --> 39:04.640
But you are welcome
to speak to him inside.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.640
He makes a mockery of the dying now.

39:11.440 --> 39:14.160
- Get back in there.

39:16.720 --> 39:20.080
You heard me!
Get back in there and destroy that dome!

39:28.560 --> 39:31.440
You should choose your enemies
more carefully, Messer Albizzi.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.760
Cosimo's minion
has been loitering around the city,

39:41.840 --> 39:44.400
even when the Medici had left.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.040
Find out what he was up to.

39:52.600 --> 39:56.080
I don't think anyone is showing up
for the demolition today.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.920
You cunning bastard.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.360
- You brought in the sick to save the dome.
- Messer Cosimo.

40:09.880 --> 40:11.640
His fever has broken.

40:11.720 --> 40:14.040
Others too are showing signs of recovery.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.800
God is merciful.

40:20.480 --> 40:21.480
Bless you, sister.

40:23.600 --> 40:27.000
Take the Corona guard back there.

40:38.960 --> 40:40.720
- Ah!

40:42.360 --> 40:43.520
Don't panic.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.640
I just want to ask you a question.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.080
Do you know who owned this?

41:01.400 --> 41:06.280
Ah! Wait, wait.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.840
It belonged to my master.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.040
-But he lost it.
-Lost it how?

41:11.120 --> 41:12.800
Cards.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.720
To whom?

41:19.520 --> 41:21.480
To Lorenzo de' Medici.

42:12.920 --> 42:17.000
- It is so good to see you.
- It is good to see you too.

42:18.440 --> 42:22.920
I'm so sorry about your mother.
It was peaceful.

42:24.760 --> 42:27.720
-How are the others? Vieri?
-Vieri is recovered.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.040
- Annoying his father.

42:31.120 --> 42:33.280
Everyone else is well.

42:35.720 --> 42:36.760
What is it?

42:38.040 --> 42:39.440
The baby.

42:45.800 --> 42:46.800
There will be others.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.200
You should speak to Piero.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Brother, a word later, about the money.

43:34.520 --> 43:39.040
Those mills were the making
of this family, and you sold them.

43:44.240 --> 43:47.160
I'm not apologizing
for myself this time, Cosimo.

43:47.240 --> 43:51.480
-I took a risk and it saved this family.
-You made our problems public.

43:51.560 --> 43:53.400
Do you have any idea
how much that might cost us?

43:54.720 --> 43:56.800
I advised him, Cosimo.

43:56.880 --> 43:58.680
The fault lies with me
as much as your brother.

44:00.200 --> 44:02.640
You just better pray
this does not come back to bite us.

44:13.760 --> 44:16.880
I can't believe Lorenzo
would be so reckless.

44:16.960 --> 44:20.960
- He is not you.
- And he's no fool either.

44:22.880 --> 44:24.280
We've all been through a great deal.

44:26.040 --> 44:27.760
Mistakes will be made.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.000
I will not let him or Ugo
bypass you again.

44:31.760 --> 44:32.960
I promise.

44:38.120 --> 44:39.720
I value you.

44:41.080 --> 44:43.040
And you know that.

44:47.400 --> 44:48.520
Without you, I...

44:54.040 --> 44:56.400
--A message, Messer.

45:05.120 --> 45:06.680
They've recalled the Signoria.

45:16.480 --> 45:19.440
Stay. Please.

45:21.160 --> 45:22.160
I would.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.640
But I must put Albizzi in his place.

45:26.720 --> 45:27.720
Now the plague is over,

45:27.800 --> 45:30.480
the Signoria will be less cowed
by the threat of revolt.

45:34.720 --> 45:36.880
-What is it?
-Nothing.

45:39.480 --> 45:40.560
I will see you later.

45:49.640 --> 45:54.720
-Do you want me to go with you?
-No, my friend. I shouldn't take long.

45:57.600 --> 45:59.400
Are you all right?

46:02.920 --> 46:03.920
I am.

46:25.440 --> 46:27.800
I was summoned to a meeting
of the Signoria.

46:27.880 --> 46:29.880
That's not why we're here.

46:38.920 --> 46:40.320
Unhand me!

46:42.160 --> 46:44.360
-You have no right!
-Oh, I have every right.

46:44.440 --> 46:46.960
-On what grounds?
-You had your man break into

46:47.040 --> 46:48.520
and loot the home of Lupo Corona.

46:48.600 --> 46:52.880
Corona's loyal guard confirmed it
with his dying breath.

46:52.960 --> 46:56.600
-Perhaps it was a mission of murder?
-Not even you can believe that.

46:56.680 --> 47:00.240
I believe you are a usurer and a thug.

47:00.320 --> 47:03.680
But if this is the only way to bring you
to justice before the Signoria,

47:03.760 --> 47:06.360
then my conscience is clear.

47:08.480 --> 47:10.760
You cannot barricade yourself
behind the sick now.

47:17.560 --> 47:20.000
See?

47:20.080 --> 47:22.000
I can meet you at your level.

47:22.080 --> 47:25.440
The Signoria will not swallow
your petty slander.

47:25.520 --> 47:29.840
I certainly won't look kindly
on Marco Bello's crimes.

47:29.920 --> 47:33.680
People are wondering who killed
the surgeon and the apothecary.

47:36.760 --> 47:43.320
If you are indeed innocent, as always,
then perhaps I should arrest him instead.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.440
Hmm?

47:57.640 --> 47:59.040
Take him.
