19:06.395 --> 19:07.396
Sorry. Just trying to help.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.570
[Trevor]
Oh, uh, Mom hates her birthday.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.030
Yep, even when we were kids,

19:16.113 --> 19:18.282
she wouldn't let us get her

19:18.366 --> 19:19.033
a cake.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.452
My dad would make
a lasagna,

19:21.535 --> 19:24.246
stick a candle in it,
and that'd be it.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.498
Birthday finito.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.709
What a shock you left him.

19:30.795 --> 19:31.837
I didn't, actually. He left me.

Hello again.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.383
[Sasha]
Hi.

19:35.466 --> 19:36.884
How's your baby?

19:36.967 --> 19:39.553
Uh, he's asleep. Thank God.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.263
[Sasha] See,
that's why I never had kids.

19:41.347 --> 19:45.351
I'm just absolutely useless
without my sleep.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.562
[Stacey]
<i>So,</i>

19:48.646 --> 19:49.647
it's set in the future.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.399
Two astronauts meet by chance

19:51.482 --> 19:53.401
on the International
Space Station.

19:53.484 --> 19:56.946
They fall desperately in love,
but their love is doomed

19:57.029 --> 19:59.990
because they're being sent off
on two different missions

20:00.074 --> 20:02.451
in opposite directions
deep in the bowels of space.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.787
Ooh.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.873
Quite the little tragedian,
isn't she?

20:07.957 --> 20:10.084
I wasn't finished.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.044
Anyways, they try
to forget each other.

20:12.128 --> 20:15.214
They build
completely new lives

20:15.297 --> 20:17.758
with new people.
But it hurts, you know?

20:17.842 --> 20:20.594
Because deep down, they
secretly still love each other.

20:20.678 --> 20:24.265
Until one day,
they run into each other again

20:24.348 --> 20:26.726
on the opposite side
of the galaxy.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.228
Out in space?

20:29.311 --> 20:30.771
That's very convenient,
isn't it?

20:30.855 --> 20:31.856
[Stacey]
Because all this time

20:31.939 --> 20:34.608
they thought they were
moving away from each other,

20:34.692 --> 20:36.235
they were actually in orbit.

20:36.318 --> 20:40.072
They were always meant
to meet again.

She says the money's hers.

25:14.096 --> 25:15.931

about Lily's trust, did she?

25:16.015 --> 25:18.434
‐Yeah.
‐Mm‐hmm.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.394

she's writing a book?

25:20.477 --> 25:21.729

No.

Mm‐hmm.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.945
Listen, I know
she can be very convincing,

25:30.029 --> 25:31.530
but she's lying.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.949
She's full of
horseshit. I mean,

25:34.033 --> 25:36.368
Lily and I loved each other,
Helen.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.454
I met her
when Christianna was five,

25:38.537 --> 25:39.621
and I helped raise her.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.123
We were a family.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.499
But when Christianna
became a teenager,

25:42.583 --> 25:45.335
she got this
asshole boyfriend

25:45.419 --> 25:47.087
that convinced her
to break into Lily's phone

25:47.171 --> 25:49.465
and steal these photos
of me and Lily naked,

25:49.548 --> 25:51.425
and Christianna went
and sold them.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.427
After that, Lily
put a stipulation

25:53.510 --> 25:54.970
in Christianna's trust

25:55.054 --> 25:56.263
that if she wanted

25:56.346 --> 25:58.015
her grandparents' money
when she was an adult,

25:58.098 --> 26:00.392
she could not disparage
me or Lily publicly.

26:00.476 --> 26:04.605
‐And has she?
‐No, not yet.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.399
But she's written
this tell‐all book,

26:07.483 --> 26:09.151
and she wants to publish it.

26:09.234 --> 26:12.279
She gets her inheritance in full
when she's 25,

26:12.362 --> 26:13.822
which gives me four years
to change her mind.

26:15.741 --> 26:16.950
I mean, why...

26:17.034 --> 26:18.744
why did Lily put you
in charge of her trust?

26:18.827 --> 26:21.497
Because she trusted me, Helen.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.707
Christianna says
you never send the checks.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.000
Mm‐hmm, because I don't
know where she lives.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.460
She's a grifter.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.712
She moves around
every six months.

26:28.796 --> 26:30.297
You know, why don't you
just give her the money

26:30.380 --> 26:32.299
and let her publish the book
if you have nothing to hide?

26:32.382 --> 26:33.717
For fuck's sake!

26:33.801 --> 26:35.803
That would ruin my career.

for too long

is angry that her mother died

on somebody.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.577
What?

27:41.660 --> 27:43.120
You can stay here
as long as you like,

27:43.203 --> 27:46.206
and I'll try to find someone
to come here and help you.

27:46.290 --> 27:47.583
What are you doing?

27:47.666 --> 27:49.418
She's his mother.
I don't think

27:49.501 --> 27:51.169
they should be
separated right now.

27:51.253 --> 27:53.714
[exhales]

27:53.797 --> 27:54.840
Hey, I'm beat.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.592
I've been awake for 24 hours,

27:56.675 --> 27:59.386
so if you'll excuse me.

27:59.469 --> 28:01.263
‐Um, Adeline,
wonderful to see you.
‐[Adeline] Mwah!

28:01.346 --> 28:03.807
‐Call me.
‐I will.

28:03.891 --> 28:06.018
‐We'll have lunch or something.
‐We will. Bye.

28:08.395 --> 28:11.231
[Adeline sighs]

28:11.315 --> 28:14.359
I‐I can tell you care
about my daughter.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.237
Many people do.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.489
She has a knack
for finding those people

28:19.573 --> 28:22.159
who want to save her,

28:22.242 --> 28:24.161
but then they just end up
enabling her addictions

28:24.244 --> 28:25.621
and laziness

28:25.704 --> 28:28.916
and her refusal
to accept any responsibility

28:28.999 --> 28:30.167
for her life.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.794
Excuse me?

28:32.878 --> 28:35.547
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not saying you're...

28:35.631 --> 28:37.174
one of those people.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.300
I‐I don't know you.

28:38.383 --> 28:42.512
But I do know my daughter.

28:43.597 --> 28:47.184
She's sweet and beautiful,

28:47.267 --> 28:50.771
but she's also a fuckup,
and she needs professional help.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.774
She doesn't need another...

28:53.857 --> 28:57.277
well‐intentioned hanger‐on.

28:57.361 --> 29:00.072
What the fuck is wrong with you?

29:02.407 --> 29:04.743
Why do you think
I'm such a fuckup, Mom?

29:04.826 --> 29:06.912
Did you know
that until I met Helen,

29:06.995 --> 29:08.705
I didn't even realize
there were people in the world

29:08.789 --> 29:12.125
who loved their kids
just for being alive?

29:12.209 --> 29:14.962
Just because
they fucking existed?

29:15.045 --> 29:17.005
You should see her
with her kids.

29:17.089 --> 29:17.464
She's amazing.

29:17.547 --> 29:18.507
She loves them.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.802
She just fucking loves them.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.054
They can fuck up or,
or say something stupid

29:24.137 --> 29:26.264
and it's like
she doesn't even notice.

29:26.348 --> 29:29.768
If I ever had
a‐a pimple on my face,

29:29.851 --> 29:30.811
you would tell me
you couldn't even look at me.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.562
I stopped eating
because you said

29:32.646 --> 29:34.648
you'd rather have
a dead daughter than a fat one.

29:34.731 --> 29:35.816
I was kidding.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.567
It wasn't fucking funny.

29:38.902 --> 29:39.486
You didn't want
a daughter.

29:39.569 --> 29:41.905
You just wanted a doll

29:41.989 --> 29:44.157
that you could dress up
and parade around

29:44.241 --> 29:45.826
and bring to interviews
when you needed

29:45.909 --> 29:47.411
‐to seem more human.
‐Oh, my God, oh, my God,

29:47.494 --> 29:49.454
oh, my God.
I tried so hard.

29:49.538 --> 29:50.455
My parents were useless.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.582
Rich and famous

29:52.666 --> 29:54.292
‐and useless.
‐Oh, my God.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.335
They had their assistant

29:55.419 --> 29:58.964
take me to get my tonsils out
when I was five.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.550
I did not want that
to be your childhood.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.177
I wanted you with me.

30:04.261 --> 30:07.389
I‐I‐I wanted us to be
in this together.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.474
You know, but I guess
I fucked up.

30:09.558 --> 30:12.394
I‐I pushed you too hard
or I protected you too much.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.271
I don't know.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.189
I think I was just so afraid

30:16.273 --> 30:18.108
of the scrutiny
you were gonna be under

30:18.191 --> 30:21.194
because you were my kid.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.697
It's a scary world,
Sierra.

30:26.116 --> 30:28.493
The only thing
that I'm scared of, Mom,

30:28.577 --> 30:31.246
in the whole world,

30:31.329 --> 30:33.707
the whole entire world...

30:33.790 --> 30:35.876
is you.

30:42.883 --> 30:45.010
How do you two
know each other again?

30:48.472 --> 30:50.140
Don't do that, Mom.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.893
Oh. [sighs] Right.

30:54.227 --> 30:55.729
She...

30:55.812 --> 30:58.231
fucked your dying husband

30:58.315 --> 31:01.526
and then got pregnant
and had his baby?

31:02.861 --> 31:06.114
Well, technically,
he wasn't my husband.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.158
Mm‐hmm.

31:08.241 --> 31:11.203
And you really feel you have
her best interests at heart.

31:13.580 --> 31:16.500
Life is short, Adeline.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.337
Okay.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.423
Sierra, I'll see you tomorrow.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.426
[footsteps retreating]

31:28.678 --> 31:29.763
[exhales]

31:29.846 --> 31:32.724
‐[sighs]
‐[door closes]

31:36.103 --> 31:38.438
Um...

31:38.522 --> 31:39.481
Do you mind if I just go to bed?

31:39.564 --> 31:41.733
I'm... very tired.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.276
Of course.

31:44.402 --> 31:46.446
Happy birthday.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.281
Thank you.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.711
[knocking at door]

32:09.094 --> 32:11.513
Happy birthday.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.978
[Noah] <i>Well, I kind of like
the cover art they chose.</i>

32:18.061 --> 32:18.937
<i>It's, like,</i>

32:19.020 --> 32:20.480
bare trees
in a winter wood.

32:20.564 --> 32:21.565
It's kind of haunting.

32:21.648 --> 32:22.732
It's a beautiful book, Noah.

32:22.816 --> 32:23.984
‐It really is.
‐Thanks.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.069
Thank you. And thank
you for your blurb.

32:26.153 --> 32:28.113
‐I'm really grateful.
‐Ah, I loved reading it.

32:28.196 --> 32:31.700
[sighs] I'm sorry about
your mom, by the way.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.368
That part was true,
wasn't it?

32:33.451 --> 32:34.161
Mm‐hmm.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.705
I had no idea
back at school.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.665
Well, nobody did.

32:38.748 --> 32:40.208
You know what I find
sort of interesting,

32:40.292 --> 32:42.335
now that I'm getting older?

32:42.419 --> 32:44.921
All those people I thought were
so cool back when I was young?

32:45.005 --> 32:47.465
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐Just effortlessly cool...

32:47.549 --> 32:50.135
Those people were
in so much pain.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.678
‐You think?
‐Ah.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.180
To a person.

32:53.263 --> 32:55.015
There's no such thing
as being cool when you're young.

32:55.098 --> 32:56.725
‐[laughs]
‐There's just different degrees

32:56.808 --> 32:59.060
of terrified and how adept
you are at hiding it.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.563
Which is inversely proportional,
in my opinion.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.273
I love you, Ariel.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.066
I love you, too, Noah.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.404
It feels like
things are finally

33:09.487 --> 33:11.823
coming back together
for you, huh?

33:12.866 --> 33:15.035
Hey, you want to get a coffee?

33:15.118 --> 33:16.119
I'm buying.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.245
Sure.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.003
Can I ask you something?

33:26.171 --> 33:27.881
I got a call a couple
of days ago

33:27.964 --> 33:29.758
from a reporter who's doing
this long‐form story

33:29.841 --> 33:32.385
about me and my "resurrection."

33:32.469 --> 33:33.887
Where? For what?

33:33.970 --> 33:34.679
<i>Vanity Fair.</i>

33:34.763 --> 33:36.556
‐Wow.
‐Mm.

33:36.640 --> 33:37.766
No, it's great, but...

33:37.849 --> 33:41.937
she asked me about this, uh,

33:42.020 --> 33:45.023
publicist I had
on the <i>Descent</i> tour...

33:45.106 --> 33:49.527
who, apparently,
has said that I...

33:49.611 --> 33:52.405
I don't know, tried
to seduce her or something.

33:52.489 --> 33:54.157
Tried to seduce her?

33:54.241 --> 33:56.826
Pressured her
into sleeping with me.

33:57.744 --> 33:59.412
That's different.

33:59.496 --> 34:01.581
I know... I know.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.208
I mean, I‐I don't know
what she meant,

34:03.291 --> 34:04.918
but, I mean,
she kind of blindsided me.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.044
What did you say?

34:06.127 --> 34:07.295
Well, I told her it wasn't true.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.420
Which it wasn't.

34:08.505 --> 34:09.547
The opposite, in fact.

34:09.630 --> 34:13.510
I mean, she was throwing herself
at me the whole time.

34:15.762 --> 34:16.846
[chuckles]
What, you don't believe me?

34:16.929 --> 34:18.139
[chuckles]
I didn't say that.

34:18.223 --> 34:19.808
But you don't.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.143
I'm telling you, she was,
she was pretty aggressive.

34:22.226 --> 34:25.605
Okay, so what
are you worried about?

34:25.688 --> 34:27.815
Well, I don't know.
Nothing, I guess.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.777
It's probably fine.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.362
The reporter didn't seem
that interested, actually.

34:32.445 --> 34:36.658
She was probably
just doing due diligence, but...

34:38.034 --> 34:39.536
I mean, this publicist, Eden,

34:39.619 --> 34:41.371
she can't just make shit up
about me, right?

34:41.454 --> 34:44.123
You know you don't have
the best reputation

34:44.206 --> 34:46.001
around this stuff, right?

34:46.083 --> 34:47.835
Ariel, that was in college,
that was 30 years ago.

34:47.918 --> 34:50.255
That's not what
I'm talking about.

34:50.338 --> 34:52.924
I'm talking about
your current reputation, Noah.

34:53.007 --> 34:53.591
In the community.

34:53.675 --> 34:55.719
What community?

34:55.802 --> 34:57.804
The publishing world.

34:57.887 --> 35:00.724
You're seen as something
of a loose cannon.

35:00.807 --> 35:01.349
What?

35:01.433 --> 35:03.560
Why?

35:03.643 --> 35:06.896
Well, you've had a storied past.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.648
You went to prison, after all.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.525
Well, that's just
fucking ridiculous.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.694
I went to prison for my...

35:14.404 --> 35:15.655
For what?

35:15.739 --> 35:17.824
Never mind.

35:17.907 --> 35:19.284
I don't deserve that.

35:19.367 --> 35:22.287
I‐I‐I have
the most boring fucking life.

35:22.370 --> 35:25.040
I work, I write, I see my kids,

35:25.123 --> 35:28.001
and I try to be
a good person, that's it.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.378
I know you do.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.840
But, look...
when you got out of prison,

35:33.923 --> 35:37.093
you were a little bit angry,
right?

35:37.177 --> 35:38.678
A little bit bitter?

35:38.762 --> 35:40.597
Sure. Prison sucks.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.682
Right, well...

35:42.766 --> 35:44.225
Do you remember teaching a class

35:44.309 --> 35:45.977
with a student named Audrey
in it?

35:46.061 --> 35:48.021
Audrey Nelson?

35:48.104 --> 35:50.982
Uh... yeah.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.568
Were you not very nice
to her?

35:55.028 --> 35:56.696
Well, I was as nice
to her as I was

35:56.780 --> 35:58.615
to anyone else
in that class. Why?

35:58.698 --> 36:00.742
She's written a book.

36:00.825 --> 36:01.368
Good for her.

36:01.451 --> 36:03.620
Apparently, you're in it.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.872
Really?

36:05.955 --> 36:08.583
She doesn't name you directly,
but it's a memoir

36:08.667 --> 36:11.961
about her abusive relationship
with an older male professor.

36:12.045 --> 36:14.589
She's going around town,
telling people

36:14.673 --> 36:18.093
that the character
is based on you.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.011
The book is getting
a lot of buzz.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.407
that I am entirely
surprised.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.909
Nowadays, you can't
be too careful.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.911
These accusations are
coming from anywhere.

Luckily, we are prepared.

You're gonna really love Joyce.

Harry filled me in
on most of the details.

37:18.653 --> 37:22.115
The reporter is Petra Ranes
from <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

37:22.198 --> 37:23.825
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐And this woman,

37:23.908 --> 37:26.453
uh, Eden Ellery, she used
to work with us, right?

37:26.536 --> 37:29.164
Right, she was our in‐house
publicist about ten years ago.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.167
She left a few years
before you arrived.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.878
Okay.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.921
And this alleged incident
happened over ten years ago?

37:37.005 --> 37:39.132
"Alleged incident"?

37:39.215 --> 37:40.717
‐Nothing happened.
‐[Harry] That's right.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.177
It seems a little convenient,
doesn't it?

37:42.260 --> 37:43.970
Just when he's got a movie

37:44.053 --> 37:45.638
and a new book coming out,
suddenly she remembers

37:45.722 --> 37:49.100
‐being harassed?
‐No, I didn't harass her.

37:49.184 --> 37:50.685
Noah, it's okay.
We're on your side.

37:50.769 --> 37:51.436
[Joyce]
And so you want to know

37:51.519 --> 37:53.146
what to give her as a statement?

37:53.229 --> 37:55.106
He already gave her a statement.

37:57.066 --> 37:58.485
Without talking to anyone?

37:58.568 --> 38:00.069
I didn't know I was supposed to.

38:00.153 --> 38:02.071
Well, what did you say?

38:02.155 --> 38:05.158
Uh, basically, I said no.

38:05.241 --> 38:08.369
Mm. Do you remember
exactly what you said?

38:08.453 --> 38:08.953
Uh...

38:09.037 --> 38:12.040
But you denied it?

38:12.123 --> 38:13.958
‐Yeah.
‐[Harry] Well, we can call

38:14.042 --> 38:15.794
and we can find out
exactly what he said, can't we?

38:15.877 --> 38:17.253
I don't know. We can try,
but she may not give it to us.

38:17.337 --> 38:20.548
Guys, there's no truth
to this story.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.007
None at all?

38:21.090 --> 38:24.844
No. I mean...

38:24.928 --> 38:27.722
I remember
Eden was very flirtatious,

38:27.806 --> 38:30.058
and I think maybe I kissed her

38:30.141 --> 38:31.851
in my hotel room, but...

38:31.935 --> 38:33.686
it was totally consensual.

38:33.770 --> 38:34.979
And you weren't married
at the time.

38:35.063 --> 38:37.816
No, I‐I was married.

38:37.899 --> 38:38.900
I was married to Alison,

38:38.983 --> 38:41.528
but, look, I know I wasn't
the best guy at that time.

38:41.611 --> 38:42.821
I know that.
Everybody knows that.

38:42.904 --> 38:45.240
I mean, so much of what
the <i>Jack Hunter</i> book is about

38:45.323 --> 38:47.992
is me wrestling with who I was
and what I did and why.

38:48.076 --> 38:49.118
But there's a difference
between poor judgment

38:49.202 --> 38:52.121
and being a criminal, right?

38:52.205 --> 38:53.289
[scoffs]
Well...

38:53.373 --> 38:54.874
For fuck's sake,
of course there is.

38:54.958 --> 38:57.043
All I'm saying is that
the court of public opinion

38:57.126 --> 39:00.547
isn't as... rigorous

39:00.630 --> 39:02.215
as the court of law these days.

39:02.298 --> 39:03.258
But, unfortunately,
that's where many

39:03.341 --> 39:05.635
of these cases are being tried.

39:05.718 --> 39:09.097
Do we have any way of getting
to Eden at this point?

39:09.180 --> 39:11.474
Surely we‐we have her contact
information somewhere.

39:11.558 --> 39:13.935
That would leave us
incredibly exposed.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.563
God forbid she turns that around
and gives it to the reporter.

39:16.646 --> 39:18.147
Oh, fuck,
I didn't think of that‐‐

39:18.231 --> 39:18.940
Guys, this is idiotic.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.608
I misspoke.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.570
I should just call up Petra
and tell her, okay, yes,

39:23.653 --> 39:24.404
there was a flirtation,

39:24.487 --> 39:26.531
but it was
completely consensual.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.908
‐That's the truth.
‐What do you think?

39:28.992 --> 39:32.161
I think it's risky,
reopening the subject.

39:32.245 --> 39:35.540
She might potentially interpret
that as an admission of guilt.

39:35.623 --> 39:38.001
We could try to kill
the piece completely.

39:38.084 --> 39:39.168
‐What?
‐I‐I'd rather we didn't, Joyce.

39:39.252 --> 39:43.506
This is a very important moment
for Noah and his career.

39:43.590 --> 39:46.551
Not to mention, such great PR
for the book.

39:46.634 --> 39:50.763
Look, if we do go back to Petra,

39:50.847 --> 39:54.475
we need to arm you with
some very specific language.

39:54.559 --> 39:57.103
I need you to talk about
how much you admire Eden‐‐

39:57.186 --> 39:59.981
actually, no, Ms. Ellery‐‐
for stepping forward.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.775
How you respect women

40:02.859 --> 40:04.068
and support
the #MeToo movement

40:04.152 --> 40:08.114
as a long‐overdue correction
of the wrongs in our society.

40:08.197 --> 40:10.450
How you assumed
that your interactions

40:10.533 --> 40:12.535
with Ms. Ellery were consensual,

40:12.619 --> 40:14.621
but if you misread
her intentions,

40:14.704 --> 40:15.455
you truly apologize

40:15.538 --> 40:17.206
‐for any‐‐
‐I‐I'm not apologizing.

40:17.290 --> 40:18.291
Eh, that's not what I'm saying‐‐

40:18.374 --> 40:20.543
You literally
just said "apologize."

40:20.627 --> 40:23.129
I'm just trying to help you
get ahead of this.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.173
‐If she's going to accuse you‐‐
‐She can't accuse me

40:25.256 --> 40:26.799
if I did nothing wrong.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.885
We're both adults,
we had a flirtation.

40:28.968 --> 40:29.886
That's just the fucking truth.

40:29.969 --> 40:33.431
Harry, you know me.
Come on, back me up here.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.933
[exhales]

40:35.016 --> 40:36.809
I think you should do
just what Joyce says.

40:36.893 --> 40:39.479
Look, she's handled a few of
these scandals for us already.

40:39.562 --> 40:43.191
She knows what she
is talking about.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.986
You can't just invent reality.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.322
Certain things happen,
other things don't.

40:49.405 --> 40:50.156
The reason it's called "truth"
is 'cause you can prove it.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.617
If you can't prove it,

40:52.700 --> 40:54.243
then it's just
your fucking opinion.

40:54.327 --> 40:56.955
Okay. I will set a call

40:57.038 --> 40:59.499
with you, me and Petra,
and I will explain

40:59.582 --> 41:01.542
that you would like
to clarify your comment.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.294
No, ple... no,
I can do that on my own.

41:03.378 --> 41:04.921
We should do this call together.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.589
Yeah, with all due respect,

41:06.673 --> 41:09.217
that's gonna look like
I‐I have something to hide.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.636
Look, I'm in town,
maybe I just go see her.

41:11.719 --> 41:12.595
‐Is that a good idea?
‐No.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.806
Oh, for fuck's sake, Harry,
you ask her

41:14.889 --> 41:16.015
when you want to wipe
your own ass?

41:16.099 --> 41:17.558
Is she running this place now?

41:17.642 --> 41:20.603
Noah. These are very precarious
times, and men like you

41:20.687 --> 41:22.647
have a target
on their backs.

41:24.023 --> 41:26.651
Okay, fine. Sorry.

41:26.734 --> 41:29.362
Look, I‐I gave an answer
that was glib.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.114
I just want to go back
and correct it.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.366
Can't I do that?

41:34.951 --> 41:37.078
Noah, let us handle this.

41:42.208 --> 41:44.210
<i>♪ tense, ominous music ♪</i>

41:44.293 --> 41:46.379
<i>♪♪♪</i>

42:00.852 --> 42:03.855
So, thanks for letting me
drop in on you like this.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.940
Are you kidding?
I'm delighted.

42:06.024 --> 42:08.526
It's nice
to see you again.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.445
I, uh, I just happened
to be down here

42:10.528 --> 42:12.030
in the neighborhood,
and it occurred to me

42:12.113 --> 42:13.656
that your office was
around here somewhere, so...

42:13.740 --> 42:15.533
Please.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.912
‐It's such a great building.
‐It really is.

42:19.996 --> 42:21.539
Where were your offices
before the,

42:21.622 --> 42:22.290
before the Towers came down?

42:22.373 --> 42:26.210
You know, um, I wasn't here.

42:26.294 --> 42:27.587
I was still in school.

42:27.670 --> 42:29.297
Of course.
[chuckles]

42:29.380 --> 42:31.632
‐Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
‐Don't be.

42:31.716 --> 42:33.801
Where were you?

42:33.885 --> 42:34.927
I was in Brooklyn.

42:35.011 --> 42:36.304
My daughter was, uh,

42:36.387 --> 42:38.264
I had just dropped her
at preschool

42:38.347 --> 42:39.098
and, uh, I was walking back
to the subway

42:39.182 --> 42:41.350
and I heard the news.

42:41.434 --> 42:42.894
Now she's getting married.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.312
In fact, that's why
I'm over here.

42:44.395 --> 42:45.188
I'm helping her plan
the wedding.

42:45.271 --> 42:47.774
Wow. Time flies.

42:47.857 --> 42:48.733
It really does.

42:52.945 --> 42:54.447
So, anyway, I was, uh,
I was thinking about

42:54.530 --> 42:56.365
the conversation
we had the other day,

42:56.449 --> 42:59.869
and, uh, uh,
while I was driving,

42:59.952 --> 43:02.205
and I just wanted to clarify
my answer to you,

43:02.288 --> 43:04.290
‐if that's okay with you.
‐Of course.

43:04.373 --> 43:06.125
Would you mind if we,
if we talked without the‐‐

43:06.209 --> 43:08.294
Off the record?

43:08.377 --> 43:10.046
Yeah, that's...
yeah, that's the term.

43:10.129 --> 43:12.090
Of course.

43:12.173 --> 43:13.716
Thank you.

43:13.800 --> 43:17.970
So I think I was just surprised
by your question, uh,

43:18.054 --> 43:20.139
because it's been
so long since, uh,

43:20.223 --> 43:21.724
Ms. Ellery and I had any,

43:21.808 --> 43:24.644
had any, uh, involvement
with each other, and...

43:24.727 --> 43:26.896
So much has happened since then,
I‐I guess I needed more time

43:26.979 --> 43:29.649
to‐to really, truly remember
what‐what happened between us

43:29.732 --> 43:31.734
on that book tour
all those years ago.

43:31.818 --> 43:34.320
And the truth is that, uh,

43:34.403 --> 43:38.574
Ms. Ellery and I, we did engage
in some flirtation.

43:38.658 --> 43:40.868
But it never went beyond that.

43:40.952 --> 43:41.828
I see.

43:41.911 --> 43:43.496
Thanks for the clarification.

43:43.579 --> 43:45.373
Do you mind
if I ask

43:45.456 --> 43:47.208
some follow‐up questions?

43:48.084 --> 43:50.002
Of course.
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

43:50.086 --> 43:52.088
I want to be
completely transparent.

43:52.171 --> 43:54.006
So, then you never had sex?

43:55.550 --> 43:57.593
Uh, no. No.

43:58.845 --> 44:00.346
No. I mean,
I, I respected Eden‐‐

44:00.429 --> 44:03.641
Ms. Ellery.
I‐I...

44:03.724 --> 44:05.852
And she was a colleague
doing a, doing a job,

44:05.935 --> 44:07.812
and I‐I supported that.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.397
Ms. Ellery, when we spoke,

44:09.480 --> 44:10.731
mentioned a party
in the Hamptons

44:10.815 --> 44:14.068
at the home of a producer
named Rodney Callahan.

44:14.152 --> 44:16.362
Okay.

44:16.445 --> 44:18.114
You didn't pressure her
into sex that night?

44:18.197 --> 44:19.198
Absolutely not.

44:19.282 --> 44:20.241
Are you sure?

44:20.324 --> 44:21.075
Yeah, I'm sure.

44:21.159 --> 44:23.411
I‐I remember the night
very well.

44:23.494 --> 44:26.873
It was... it was the night
my second wife went into labor.

44:26.956 --> 44:28.791
And there was a giant hurricane,
which was flooding the roads,

44:28.875 --> 44:32.086
and I‐I was...
doing everything in my power

44:32.170 --> 44:33.880
to try and make it home to her.

44:33.963 --> 44:34.589
That sounds dramatic.

44:34.672 --> 44:38.759
Yeah... well, it all worked out.

44:38.843 --> 44:40.469
Okay.

44:40.553 --> 44:42.054
Well, I...

44:42.138 --> 44:43.097
appreciate your candor.

44:43.181 --> 44:44.265
Thank you.

44:45.808 --> 44:47.560
[exhales]
Thank you.

44:47.643 --> 44:50.062
Thank you.

44:50.146 --> 44:52.273
Actually, Noah,

44:52.356 --> 44:54.066
do you mind if I ask
a few more questions?

44:54.150 --> 44:56.235
I was gonna have someone
call you to fact‐check,

44:56.319 --> 44:58.988
but as long
as I've got you here...

44:59.071 --> 45:01.199
Of course.

45:01.282 --> 45:03.409
Do you mind if we...
go on the record?

45:03.492 --> 45:05.953
Sure.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.663
[exhales]

45:07.747 --> 45:10.041
Okay, so I wanted
to go back

45:10.124 --> 45:11.959
to the origins of <i>Descent.</i>

45:12.043 --> 45:15.755
I found out, from other
interviews you gave at the time,

45:15.838 --> 45:18.257
that much of it was written
in a rubber room

45:18.341 --> 45:21.344
where you were sent on probation
from your teaching job

45:21.427 --> 45:22.428
at Kings Science
and Tech.

45:22.511 --> 45:23.429
That's right.

45:23.512 --> 45:25.932
Why were you there?

45:27.975 --> 45:29.936
Uh, I'd recently split
with my wife,

45:30.019 --> 45:32.063
and I'd had a, uh...

45:32.146 --> 45:36.567
completely consensual liaison
with another teacher.

45:36.651 --> 45:37.568
"Liaison"?

45:37.652 --> 45:41.155
I can't think
of any other way to describe it.

45:41.239 --> 45:42.657
Zoe Sobler, right?

45:42.740 --> 45:44.492
She was a student teacher
at the time.

45:44.575 --> 45:45.326
So, under
your supervision?

45:45.409 --> 45:48.037
No, no, she wasn't...

45:48.120 --> 45:49.664
[stammers]
She‐she was a student teacher,

45:49.747 --> 45:50.790
but she wasn't
under my supervis...

45:50.873 --> 45:51.916
I mean, she‐she never...

45:51.999 --> 45:53.501
she didn't teach
in my classroom.

45:53.584 --> 45:54.210
She didn't report directly
to you‐‐

45:54.293 --> 45:55.461
is that what you're saying?

45:55.544 --> 45:56.504
No. I mean, yes.

45:56.587 --> 45:57.630
That‐that is what I'm saying.

45:57.713 --> 45:58.798
She didn't report to me.

45:58.881 --> 46:00.633
Okay. So I had that wrong.

46:00.716 --> 46:01.717
Well, I'm sure there are records
that could prove‐‐

46:01.801 --> 46:03.552
Likewise,
do you remember a student

46:03.636 --> 46:06.806
from your seminar at Livingston?

46:06.889 --> 46:08.391
Audrey Nelson.

46:10.935 --> 46:12.311
Uh, yes. Yeah.

46:12.395 --> 46:14.480
I understand she has
a new memoir coming out.

46:14.563 --> 46:16.357
I'm so proud
of her, it's...

46:16.440 --> 46:18.359
Yeah, I read it.

46:18.442 --> 46:19.902
It's very good.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.780
But, uh,
most of it centers

46:22.863 --> 46:25.241
around the main character's
relationship

46:25.324 --> 46:27.201
with her seminar
professor,

46:34.083 --> 46:39.880
that she can't be a writer
because she has no inner life.

46:39.964 --> 46:42.133
She also describes
a conversation

46:42.216 --> 46:43.843
in which the professor claims

46:43.926 --> 46:46.095
that sex doesn't need
to be consensual

46:46.178 --> 46:48.681
in order for a woman
to enjoy it.

46:55.646 --> 46:59.567
I, I mean, possibly, I...

46:59.650 --> 47:03.946

a few very nuanced

47:04.030 --> 47:05.531
and complicated conversations,

47:05.614 --> 47:07.575

47:08.409 --> 47:10.202

47:10.286 --> 47:11.370

unapologetic misogynist.

I‐I had even attempted suicide,
so, yes,

in my state of mind
at that time of my life,

47:29.013 --> 47:31.057
I was probably...

47:31.140 --> 47:33.392

of instructor.

47:33.476 --> 47:35.644

47:35.728 --> 47:38.356

to her material

47:38.439 --> 47:39.523
is not a criminal act.

47:39.607 --> 47:42.443

47:42.526 --> 47:44.570
conflate
the current political climate

47:44.653 --> 47:46.655
with my very brief association
with her

56:50.449 --> 56:52.117
I just came by to...

56:52.200 --> 56:54.161
wish you a happy birthday.

56:54.244 --> 56:55.621
I brought dinner.

56:55.704 --> 56:57.789
‐I don't know if you guys have‐‐
‐Oh, that's so sweet.

56:57.873 --> 56:59.291
I mean, we ate already,
but the kids made cake.

56:59.374 --> 56:59.958
Do you want to come in?

57:00.042 --> 57:02.836
Sure.

57:05.213 --> 57:06.798
[Stacey]
Dad!

57:06.882 --> 57:08.133
Hey. Hey, Stacey.

57:08.216 --> 57:11.178
<i>[music playing faintly]</i>

57:11.261 --> 57:12.095
Perfect timing.
We were just about

57:12.179 --> 57:14.306
to sing "Happy Birthday."

57:14.389 --> 57:16.642
[chuckles]
Great.

57:16.725 --> 57:18.226
‐Hey, Dad.
‐Hey, Trev.

57:18.310 --> 57:19.811
Nice cake.

57:19.895 --> 57:21.563
Thank you.

57:23.190 --> 57:26.151
Lasagna for my birthday.

57:26.234 --> 57:26.610
Thank you.

57:28.737 --> 57:30.489
How's Whitney?

57:30.572 --> 57:31.448
Uh, she's good.
She's‐she's great.

57:31.531 --> 57:34.034
[Helen] Thank you again
for doing that.

57:34.117 --> 57:35.661
No, no. It was my pleasure.

57:35.744 --> 57:38.038
And Martin called today.

57:38.121 --> 57:40.248
He says he made
the dean's list.

57:40.332 --> 57:42.209
‐You're kidding me.
‐Nope.

57:42.292 --> 57:45.003
[exhales]
We did good, Solloway, somehow.

57:47.089 --> 57:49.007
Uh, do you want some?

57:49.091 --> 57:50.258
The kids and I
are about to have a toast.

57:50.342 --> 57:52.052
What, even Stacey?

57:52.135 --> 57:53.595
‐She can have a little.
‐[phone ringing]

57:53.679 --> 57:54.596
Sure.

57:58.475 --> 58:00.185
That's so weird.
This New York number

58:00.268 --> 58:02.729
has been calling me all day, and
they won't leave a voice mail.

58:02.813 --> 58:03.480
Hello.

58:03.563 --> 58:07.025
Yeah, this is Helen Solloway.

58:07.109 --> 58:10.278
I'm sorry,
from what magazine?

58:10.362 --> 58:13.031
[quietly]
<i>Vanity Fair.</i>

58:13.115 --> 58:14.491
‐Helen‐‐
‐Uh, okay. I need two minutes.

58:14.574 --> 58:16.660
Can we start drinking
without you?

58:16.743 --> 58:18.870
[whispers]
It's just two minutes.

58:18.954 --> 58:20.038
‐Helen‐‐
‐Okay, Petra,

58:20.122 --> 58:22.040
