00:06.840 --> 00:08.242
Previously on ER:

00:08.276 --> 00:09.443
CARTER:
I want to help you.

00:09.477 --> 00:10.344
You want to fix me?

00:10.378 --> 00:11.412
No, I want it to work.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.114
Yeah, well, I'm not broken.

00:13.147 --> 00:15.216
I'm Glass Half-Full,
I'm Silver Lining Girl

00:15.249 --> 00:16.250
I'm an optimist.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.651
Um... I guess I do

00:17.685 --> 00:19.587
get a little blue sometimes.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.590
CARTER:
Gallant, what did I just tell
you about Stella?

00:22.623 --> 00:24.225
I still need to rule
out ..., don't I?

00:24.258 --> 00:25.193
Yes. Do it.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.560
Get her out of here.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.696
Screen her before she presents
with something else.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.231
She's going to
suck him dry.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.432
Yes, she is.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:21.649 --> 01:24.218
Time of death: 7:36 A.M.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.853
Oh, your fish coded?

01:25.886 --> 01:27.555
Yup, third
time this week.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.191
Every afternoon
I restock the
little pond here

01:30.224 --> 01:33.361
and every morning,
it's like the Exxon
Valdez blew through.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.896
Why don't you get somebody else
to do this for you?

01:35.929 --> 01:36.797
No, I'm committed now.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.266
Committed fish killer.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.800
Don't, don't, don't, don't...

01:39.833 --> 01:41.269
Thank you.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.171
Been meaning to cut
down on my caffeine.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.239
How come I have
to wait out here now?

01:45.273 --> 01:46.907
Uh, so you won't kill us.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.177
I never even touched you.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.544
Whose idea was
this, anyway?

01:50.578 --> 01:52.480
Hospital Beautification
Committee.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.415
Years to get a
decent security system.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.217
Two weeks to
get an aquarium.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.452
Yeah, metal detectors,
bulletproof glass.

01:58.486 --> 01:59.887
We'll all be much safer.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.422
Gang go out again
last night?

02:01.455 --> 02:02.890
It's not a gang;
it's a club.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.259
Not another stage-diving
incident, I hope.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.594
First rule of girls' club

02:06.627 --> 02:08.529
is you don't talk
about girls' club.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.697
You're not going
to tell me

02:09.729 --> 02:11.299
what you did?
The usual.

02:11.332 --> 02:14.902
Crank calls, pillow fights,
lesbian experimentation.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.237
They're going live
in a minute.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.271
We need your outlet.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.539
What channel
is it on?

02:18.572 --> 02:20.241
Four, and you guys
are going to keep it down

02:20.274 --> 02:21.275
once we're rolling,
right?

02:21.309 --> 02:22.843
Nothing new on the board, huh?

02:22.876 --> 02:25.213
It's been three
hours since we
had a real patient.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.780
Five hours since the
last ambulance run.

02:26.814 --> 02:27.815
What's that all about?

02:27.848 --> 02:29.350
Mission General reopened.

02:29.383 --> 02:30.618
Oh, don't sound
so depressed.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.885
I'm waiting
on some action.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.221
When I was in school

02:33.221 --> 02:34.688
we ate dried eel
and bitter almond.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.590
Uh, I think I'll live
with the headache.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.658
CARTER:
Eel?

02:37.691 --> 02:38.926
Yeah, for Susan's hangover.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.328
Ah. Kudzu.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.595
PRATT:
What?

02:41.629 --> 02:43.931
Asian root;
you make a tea with it.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.899
Hair of the dog
that bit you.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.336
Yeah, it feels
like a pack of dogs

02:48.369 --> 02:50.504
and they all had a Mexican tag.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.805
Thank you
for getting me home.

02:51.839 --> 02:52.973
I'm so sorry
about your shoes.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.308
Wow, sounds
like some party.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.576
They're starting.

02:55.609 --> 02:56.977
MAN:
Okay, folks,
a little quiet.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.279
We're coming

02:58.312 --> 02:59.813
to you from the
ambulance bay

02:59.847 --> 03:01.882
of County General Hospital.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.851
( everybody laughing )

03:03.884 --> 03:05.319
We've asked Dr. Kerry
to demonstrate

03:05.353 --> 03:06.987
how easy it can be
to get your flu shot.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.257
SUZY:
Tell us, Dr. Kerry, any risks
associated with this?

03:09.290 --> 03:12.926
Yes. You may experience
some mild flu-like symptoms

03:12.960 --> 03:14.595
muscle ache, low fever

03:14.628 --> 03:18.266
but it's really a very safe
prophylactic measure.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.268
Now, a week or more of
misery is a lot worse

03:20.301 --> 03:22.770
than one little shot,
isn't it, Dr. K?

03:22.803 --> 03:24.838
Yes, and that's why we recommend

03:24.872 --> 03:28.309
flu shots for the elderly,
those with chronic illnesses

03:28.342 --> 03:31.712
and anyone taking care of
or exposed to sick people.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.381
Wow, that
was like butter.

03:33.414 --> 03:37.351
So... what's the
other one for?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.557
Tell me she didn't forget
to switch needles.

03:43.591 --> 03:48.296
She forgot to switch needles.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.449
Pretty nice setup
you got here.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.616
Ought to keep the riffraff out.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.051
So, how did you
manage to score

04:44.084 --> 04:45.553
opening day triage duty?

04:45.586 --> 04:47.555
You know, I'm thinking
some nice doctor

04:47.588 --> 04:48.722
put in a good word for you.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.057
Mmm, I hate triage.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.892
Nothing to do, Pratt?

04:51.925 --> 04:53.361
I'm orienting Lola.

04:53.361 --> 04:54.462
Mona.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.529
Melanie Shepherd?

04:55.563 --> 04:56.630
Yes.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.765
Take you in now.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.601
Mommy, Mommy...

05:00.634 --> 05:01.869
I'll be back in a minute, hon.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.571
He can come if you want.

05:03.604 --> 05:04.938
No, we'll wait here.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.574
Bobby, come
over here.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.908
Where's Mommy going?

05:07.941 --> 05:09.743
Stop whining
and sit down.

05:09.777 --> 05:10.911
When can we go home?

05:10.944 --> 05:12.079
I want to go home.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.647
What, are you
a baby, huh?

05:13.681 --> 05:14.648
Is this what
big boys do?

05:14.682 --> 05:15.949
( whimpering )

05:15.983 --> 05:18.118
Hey, shut up!

05:18.151 --> 05:19.653
( whimpering )

05:19.687 --> 05:21.422
Mommy's not going
to get any better

05:21.455 --> 05:22.590
if you don't
knock it off.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.425
Excuse me, sir,
do you need anything?

05:24.458 --> 05:25.626
No, not anymore, thanks.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.694
( whimpering ):
I want Mommy.

05:26.727 --> 05:27.828
I want Mommy.

05:27.861 --> 05:28.929
Hey, hey.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.564
If you do
not shut up...!

05:30.598 --> 05:32.466
Sir, look, I don't mean
to interrupt you...

05:32.500 --> 05:33.667
Then don't,
okay, pal?

05:33.701 --> 05:35.903
You're real
helpful now.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.838
Where were you three hours ago
when we got here?

05:37.871 --> 05:39.673
( crying )

05:39.707 --> 05:40.874
Stop it.

05:40.908 --> 05:41.875
I said stop it.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.010
Are you a
baby? Huh?

05:43.043 --> 05:44.612
See you almost
earned yourself

05:44.645 --> 05:45.746
a badge there, Mikey.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.780
Excuse me?

05:46.814 --> 05:48.549
I'm guessing Eagle Scout.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.150
Look, I didn't want to make
it any worse than it was.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.752
Well, did you make it
any better?

05:51.785 --> 05:52.586
At least I tried.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.988
Karate-- really?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.924
but I want something
a little more aggressive.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.526
Oh, so, you like
it rough, huh?

05:58.559 --> 06:00.428
A gun to the head brings out
the fighter in a girl.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.962
Oh, so, now you're
showing off.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.997
Gallant, your
girlfriend's
asking for you.

06:04.031 --> 06:04.898
Girlfriend?

06:04.932 --> 06:06.667
Stella Willits, 45

06:06.700 --> 06:09.737
frequent flyer, going on 60,
with a borderline personality.

06:09.770 --> 06:10.938
Yes, that sounds
about right.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.773
Asking for Michael
Gallant, M.D.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.075
I've had to see her four times
in the last week.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.977
Well, you're doing
an excellent job.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.111
Get her exam going.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.179
I'll be there in a minute.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.448
The tests
are just a precaution.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.149
They should take
about an hour.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.452
And then I'll know
if she infected me
with anything.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.619
Don't be such a jerk.

06:25.653 --> 06:26.954
She used to date a bisexual.

06:26.987 --> 06:27.888
He wasn't a bisexual.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.723
He was just open-minded.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.159
Great, I'll, uh,
be back when the
results are in.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.628
You wanted to do
the freaking medical spot.

06:34.662 --> 06:35.729
Shut up, Leland.

06:35.763 --> 06:36.664
You shut up!
No, you shut up.

06:36.697 --> 06:37.965
No, you shut up!
Shut up!

06:37.998 --> 06:39.833
Is anyone aware that
according to this

06:39.867 --> 06:41.602
there aren't enough
nurses on duty

06:41.635 --> 06:43.937
to reach the
maximum patient-
to-nurse ratios?

06:43.971 --> 06:45.706
LEWIS:
I'll take a look at it.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.476
And there's not even
an MICN scheduled for Friday.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.543
Randi, get Haleh
on the phone.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.978
She's off today.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.813
I don't care.
She's the Nurse Manager.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.815
Nope. She resigned
in September.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.684
Well, have they appointed
a replacement?

06:56.717 --> 06:58.118
Yeah. She resigned
last week.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.687
Why wasn't I informed of this?

06:59.720 --> 07:01.689
Because you haven't
been around that much.

07:01.722 --> 07:02.723
Dr. Weaver

07:02.756 --> 07:05.526
your makeup
looked great.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.160
Abby.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.029
Could you come by
my office later?

07:09.062 --> 07:11.799
Sure. Dr. Romano's office?

07:11.832 --> 07:13.033
1:30.
Why?

07:13.066 --> 07:14.902
Let's make it 2:00.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.739
GALLANT:
Breathe in deep.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.940
( breathing deeply )

07:19.973 --> 07:20.941
Good. Again.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.576
( breathing deeply )

07:22.610 --> 07:25.012
I gave up cholesterol, Michael,
after our little talk.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.246
You'll thank me later.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.781
I'll thank you now.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.583
CARTER:
Find anything?

07:29.617 --> 07:30.684
Some chest pain

07:30.718 --> 07:31.652
reproducible
by palpation.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.753
Hey, you know Howdy Doody?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.087
You look like
Howdy Doody.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.188
Thanks.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.557
I hate Howdy Doody.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.591
Sorry to hear that,
Miss Willits.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.626
Call me Stella.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.528
It means "star,"
you know.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.664
Listen, what I'm concerned about
is her dyspnea on exertion.

07:43.697 --> 07:44.898
My what?

07:44.932 --> 07:46.800
Uh, it's your shortness
of breath.

07:46.834 --> 07:47.968
Congestive
heart failure?

07:48.001 --> 07:49.069
Or her lungs are dry.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.738
It could be
symptomatic ischemia.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.641
Flat T waves in
her lateral leads.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.810
Yeah, but I'd still
recommend O2, aspirin

07:56.844 --> 07:58.111
nitropaste,
and a cards consult.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.913
She should go upstairs
for monitoring.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.114
I think that
might be

08:01.148 --> 08:02.550
a little
premature.

08:02.550 --> 08:03.984
Why don't we send off
some enzymes?

08:04.017 --> 08:05.819
Get her old chart

08:05.853 --> 08:08.155
take a look
at her previous 12 lead.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.123
If the changes are acute?

08:10.157 --> 08:12.560
Have Cardiology
come down.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.927
So

08:13.961 --> 08:15.696
you going to run some tests now?

08:15.729 --> 08:17.665
Yes, ma'am.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.834
Can I go out
and grab a smoke first

08:20.868 --> 08:23.737
How long have you
been retired, Thomas?

08:23.771 --> 08:25.573
I ain't retired.
I'm not.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.640
Oh.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.642
A nurse's work is never done.

08:28.676 --> 08:29.677
Thank you.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.745
How's the hangover?

08:31.779 --> 08:33.714
Oh, I'm going with aspirin

08:33.746 --> 08:34.881
and caffeine.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.216
Ow!
Sorry.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.684
Yeah.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.653
Abby said it
was a good time.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.822
Don't worry,
she hasn't cheated on you

08:41.855 --> 08:43.756
since that stripper
named Thor.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.626
I can be concerned, right?

08:45.659 --> 08:47.928
Don't be. He was wearing
an American flag thong.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.230
No, I mean about
her drinking.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.699
Did I bring my lunch?

08:51.732 --> 08:52.800
We'll get you
something.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.835
I'm the one who barfed.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.704
Yeah, but she's
the alcoholic.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.939
It's not easy to
stay in the program

08:58.972 --> 09:01.742
when you're out
bar hopping.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.243
Uh, "the program"?

09:03.276 --> 09:04.712
Yeah, I thought you knew.

09:04.745 --> 09:08.716
Would you take Mr. Evans
upstairs to CT?

09:08.749 --> 09:10.317
She doesn't drink
that much.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.152
I never even thought
about it.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.787
What's "not that much"?

09:13.821 --> 09:16.089
Well, if you're worried,
you should talk to her.

09:16.123 --> 09:19.359
Carter, films are back
on your patella fracture.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.994
What's wrong?

09:21.028 --> 09:23.931
Nothing. The same one?

09:23.964 --> 09:25.866
Oh, what's the best way
to rule out PE--

09:25.899 --> 09:26.900
a spiral CT
or a VQ scan?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.268
( chuckling )

09:28.301 --> 09:30.037
Okay, I'm only going
to say this once.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.271
I hate surprise
parties.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.906
Carter assumed
I was in the loop.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.341
What loop?

09:34.374 --> 09:36.176
The drinking loop.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.748
Oh...

09:40.781 --> 09:45.185
He's concerned...
which I think is very sweet.

09:48.121 --> 09:51.124
I'm, I-I didn't
want you to feel
weird about it.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.760
It's none
of my business.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.195
And I just wanted us
to have a good time.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.664
I understand.

09:56.664 --> 09:57.731
It's not like
I'm, I'm...

09:57.765 --> 09:58.799
It's between you
and Carter.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.804
I'm sorry he got you into it.

10:03.837 --> 10:04.772
No, it was an accident.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.040
He thought I knew.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.777
Yeah. Well, it's, it's
not like it's a big
secret, either. It's...

10:09.810 --> 10:10.844
( clattering )

10:19.286 --> 10:20.754
( sighing softly )

10:22.790 --> 10:25.258
Kerry.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.895
Susan.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.130
Abby.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.802
You don't think
she could be...
No chance.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.069
That's what it
looked like.
Weaver?

10:36.103 --> 10:37.671
The straightest gay
woman since Janet Reno?

10:37.705 --> 10:39.039
I don't think so.
Yeah, you're
right.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.140
She was probably
just practicing

10:40.173 --> 10:41.374
her flu shot
technique.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.776
Yeah, she could use
the practice.

10:42.810 --> 10:43.811
My turn now?

10:43.844 --> 10:44.912
Not yet.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.313
When is my turn?

10:46.346 --> 10:47.314
Later.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.882
I was here before.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.417
Go back to your
seat, Phil.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.785
( sighs )

10:51.819 --> 10:53.754
We should have left
him in Triage.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.923
The other patients
were complaining.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.357
Abby--

10:57.390 --> 10:59.392
the junkie in Four
fell out of bed
and lost his IV.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.862
Okay, I'll be right there.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.399
Listen...

11:06.433 --> 11:10.370
it's just not something
I talk about much.

11:10.403 --> 11:11.905
We're friends, Abby.

11:11.939 --> 11:14.241
If you want to talk,
you know where I am.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.376
And if not, that's
okay, too.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.410
Thank you.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.146
So, did you get some meat loaf

11:19.179 --> 11:20.914
this trip, Miss Willis?

11:20.948 --> 11:21.815
I'm a vegan now.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.216
Good for you.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.818
It's a simple case
of costochondritis.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.319
Look, I think the
DOE could be

11:26.353 --> 11:27.254
her anginal
equivalent.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.455
Or it could be simply be

11:28.488 --> 11:30.290
that the only exercise
the old bird gets

11:30.323 --> 11:32.225
is lifting a match
to her cigarettes.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.094
Send her home on Naprosyn.
Do you still work here?

11:34.127 --> 11:35.996
Last time
I checked.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.198
Shouldn't we be
concerned with the
progressive dyspnea?

11:38.231 --> 11:40.801
When you become
an actual doctor, Mr. Gallant

11:40.834 --> 11:42.435
then you can make
the diagnosis.

11:42.469 --> 11:46.206
Just thought you might want
to monitor her in cardiology.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.041
You know, I don't know
why your student

11:48.075 --> 11:49.176
calls me in
for a consult

11:49.209 --> 11:50.410
and then refuses
to accept my advice.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.212
He's just trying
to be thorough.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.181
She's had ten unnecessary
admissions for rule-out MI

11:54.214 --> 11:55.448
in the last two
years alone

11:55.482 --> 11:57.284
and she has always
had flat T-waves.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.218
Next time, check the records.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.352
I did.
Ah--

11:59.386 --> 12:02.255
then you know
I already cathed her.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.256
So much for thoroughness.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.359
Did you check the chart?

12:06.393 --> 12:08.061
No, there is no record
of a cath in there.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.930
I looked at volumes eight
and nine, everything since 2000.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.298
Maybe he cathed her before that.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.400
Well, a lot could
have changed since then.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.302
Well, if he won't admit
her, there's not much
we can do about it.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.404
Dr. Carter, can we keep her
for observation?

12:17.437 --> 12:19.106
No, we cannot;
we don't have any beds.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.440
We've got ten
patients waiting.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.508
She needs to be
on a monitor.

12:21.541 --> 12:22.475
Do you
have a minute?

12:22.509 --> 12:23.977
Yeah, I can give you two.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.445
The best we can do
is park her in the hall

12:25.478 --> 12:27.014
until a bed opens up--

12:27.047 --> 12:29.817
until her Treponin
comes back from the lab.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.218
I talked to Susan.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.254
Hey, Abby, 11-year-old girl
with possible UTI.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.322
Okay, I'm coming.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.357
HARMS:
A little help, folks?

12:37.390 --> 12:41.995
Unidentified Latino found
seizing at a phone booth.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.396
Head atraumatic.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.933
Pulse ox 99, glucose 110,
GCS five on scene.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.234
Dude's post-ictal

12:47.267 --> 12:49.269
but he's got
a good DBI.
DBI?

12:49.302 --> 12:51.972
Dirt Ball Index.
Big dog, lots
of tattoos.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.073
Oh, so he's going
to be all right

12:53.106 --> 12:54.207
'cause he's got tattoos?

12:54.241 --> 12:55.843
Good guys die,
bad dogs walk.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.178
This one looks
like he's going
to be okay.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.580
He's got a little
abrasion to his chin.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.884
No prison tats;
too bad, they
count double.

13:03.917 --> 13:04.852
He's military.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.353
Sats 98, BP 110/76.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.055
MAN:
I don't know
if I'm supposed to.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.389
Slow down.
Sorry about
that.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.324
It's all right, Thomas,
it's all right.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.259
Now, how about
that signature?

13:12.292 --> 13:13.493
Margaret usually signed.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.228
Yes, well, she
can't right now

13:15.262 --> 13:17.030
that's why I need
you to do it.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.031
Dr. Corday,
she's waking up.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.967
Oh, okay.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.170
Thomas, I want you
to stay right here
for a moment, okay?

13:23.203 --> 13:24.571
Third unit going in.

13:24.604 --> 13:27.407
Have them hold the FFP
until we're upstairs.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.177
Margaret... Margaret

13:30.210 --> 13:32.612
I'm Dr. Corday.
You were in an accident.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.947
Is Thomas okay?

13:33.981 --> 13:35.348
Yes, he's fine

13:35.382 --> 13:37.050
but you've suffered
a splenic laceration

13:37.084 --> 13:39.352
and your husband feels unable
to sign the consent

13:39.386 --> 13:40.320
for your surgery.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.289
Operation? I can't.

13:42.322 --> 13:46.493
There is some risk involved,
but it needs to be done.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.929
I can't stay in
bed so long.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.131
He couldn't cope
without me.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.966
I'm sure he'll make do.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.402
He's has Alzheimer's.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.372
Well, you shouldn't be
incapacitated very long

13:59.406 --> 14:01.241
but you need to sign this
so we can help you.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.409
Please.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.145
Can't we just wait
and see?

14:05.178 --> 14:09.216
Margaret... splenic fractures
can form clots

14:09.249 --> 14:11.318
that may hold for awhile,
but if the clot breaks

14:11.351 --> 14:13.921
you might bleed to death
before we can fix it.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.493
Meds are in.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.494
P.E.R.R.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.263
What?

14:23.296 --> 14:25.098
Pupils equal, round,
and reactive.
( chuckles )

14:25.132 --> 14:25.966
Airway's good.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.100
Gato, you okay, man?

14:27.134 --> 14:28.301
We've given him
some medication

14:28.335 --> 14:30.137
to prevent him
from having seizures.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.438
So, has he been
sick recently?

14:31.471 --> 14:32.973
We were out late last
night going hard

14:33.006 --> 14:34.074
but he seemed fine.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.308
We just got back
on leave.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.177
He hasn't even seen
his girl yet.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.346
Nothing involved besides
alcohol, right?

14:40.280 --> 14:41.281
Coke, Ecstasy?

14:41.314 --> 14:42.950
Just beer and bourbon.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.317
No liberty stunts, right?

14:44.351 --> 14:45.152
How's that?

14:45.185 --> 14:46.119
He shows signs

14:46.153 --> 14:47.454
of toxicity; you guys

14:47.487 --> 14:48.588
didn't play any pranks on him,
did you?

14:48.621 --> 14:49.689
Roofies, Quaaludes?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.324
Hey, he's our buddy,
all right?

14:51.358 --> 14:54.161
Look, easy, Sergeant;
we just need to be sure.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.462
We wouldn't do that.
Okay.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.097
You guys can wait
in the hall.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.365
Gallant

14:58.398 --> 15:00.367
send off a Dilantin
level in 15 minutes.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.368
Got it.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.435
( coughs )

15:02.469 --> 15:04.972
So, you guys
are rangers?

15:04.972 --> 15:08.008
75th Regiment,
Special Forces Group.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.442
Where are they taking him?

15:09.476 --> 15:12.145
He needs a CT to check
for any sign of a tumor

15:12.179 --> 15:13.380
or intercranial
bleeding.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.514
So, you guys see
any action?

15:14.547 --> 15:16.349
Nothing
to talk about.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.618
I did a summer duty
down at Fort Houston
a few months back.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.652
You Army?

15:19.686 --> 15:20.988
Yeah, Medical Corps.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.022
Why are you here?

15:22.055 --> 15:23.423
I'm finishing med school.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.059
( scoffs ):
Must be rough.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.461
We spent the last three months
jumping out of Blackhawks

15:28.495 --> 15:30.663
on the Pakistani border.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.066
Hey, let us know when
our buddy's back.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.039
It burns when she pees

15:39.072 --> 15:41.008
she's achy and sick
to her stomach.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.042
Low-grade fever.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.443
I think it's from
the trip.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.377
On vacation?

15:44.411 --> 15:45.712
No, just
a weekend away.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.547
We're supposed to go
to the Shadd Aquarium.

15:47.580 --> 15:48.681
Has she had any
UTIs before?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.050
Yeah, a bunch.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.484
It usually clears up
with antibiotics.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.021
Her doctor gave us
some Bactrim

15:54.054 --> 15:56.023
but I left it
in Milwaukee.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.091
Okay, let's dip
a urine.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.560
I don't want a catheter, okay?

16:00.593 --> 16:02.162
You're the boss.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.696
So, what kind of accent is that?

16:05.132 --> 16:07.434
What accent?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.036
Come on,
where are you from?

16:09.036 --> 16:10.570
Um, I don't think
you've heard of it.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.539
Place called
"Idaho."

16:12.572 --> 16:13.440
( chuckles )

16:13.473 --> 16:15.375
Well, that explains it.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.078
You like potatoes?

16:18.111 --> 16:19.612
Who doesn't?
Mom...

16:19.646 --> 16:21.114
I'm hungry.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.316
Oh, okay. Let me, uh...
go get you a sandwich.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.086
Here you go, Abby.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.220
Why are you giving
me this?

16:27.254 --> 16:28.655
Next Friday,
I need it off.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.158
Oh. Well, I'd like a
month in the Bahamas.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.460
I'll settle for
a long weekend
at my cousin's.

16:33.493 --> 16:37.397
Jerry, are the labs
back on my UTI girl?

16:37.430 --> 16:39.799
No. But look--
I made origami.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.101
It's a swan.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.269
No, it's not.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.503
I think it is.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.505
Then we should hang it
on the refrigerator

16:45.538 --> 16:47.240
next to your
report card.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.641
Thanks, Mom,
you're the best.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.642
Hello.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.544
We are waiting
for your labs.

16:51.578 --> 16:55.382
I got bored in there,
there's too many
sick people.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.284
Mmm.
Where's your mom?

16:57.317 --> 16:59.086
She went to the
cafeteria.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.353
To get food?

17:00.387 --> 17:02.189
That's not a good idea.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.392
We were supposed to
do all this fun
stuff today.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.560
I wanted to see
the aquarium.

17:07.594 --> 17:08.428
The aquarium?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.130
Really?

17:10.163 --> 17:12.499
Well, you should have said so
in the first place.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.700
Hey, Abby,
open room?

17:13.733 --> 17:14.733
Try Exam Two.

17:14.767 --> 17:15.801
How was his CT?

17:15.835 --> 17:17.204
It was all clear.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.172
Hey, what's going
on, Stella?

17:19.205 --> 17:20.640
Nicotine fits
are a bitch.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.242
Hey, look, we're
checking on a bed
for you, okay?

17:23.276 --> 17:24.277
How about a decent
cup of coffee?

17:24.310 --> 17:25.712
How's he doing?

17:25.744 --> 17:27.714
There's no sign
of a tumor; that's good.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.549
What's up
with his mouth?

17:29.582 --> 17:31.484
We gave him a
charcoal slurry to
soak up any drugs

17:31.518 --> 17:32.552
that might be in
his GI tract.

17:32.585 --> 17:33.753
Look, I already
told you guys...

17:33.786 --> 17:35.722
Look, there's
something toxic

17:35.755 --> 17:37.390
in your buddy's system, okay?

17:37.424 --> 17:40.160
We're just trying to fix him up.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.232
Hey.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.233
How you feeling, bro?

17:46.266 --> 17:47.567
( breathing weakly )

17:47.600 --> 17:48.401
Perk?

17:48.435 --> 17:49.636
Hey, man.

17:49.669 --> 17:50.537
Who's that?

17:50.570 --> 17:51.571
It's Sammo.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.873
Hey, is-is Elena here?

17:53.906 --> 17:56.476
No, we called her,
she wasn't home.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.445
Where are we?
I'm Dr. Gallant.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.612
Felix, you're in
County Hospital.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.781
Hey, my eyes...
are my eyes open?

18:01.814 --> 18:02.782
Shut up, fool.

18:02.815 --> 18:03.716
No, I can't see you.

18:03.750 --> 18:04.751
Cut it out.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.419
No, I can't see anything!

18:06.453 --> 18:08.188
Okay, okay, hold still.

18:10.557 --> 18:15.528
Okay, uh, bring me a scope,
page Optho, find Carter.

18:15.562 --> 18:16.796
Not quite the Shadd Aquarium

18:16.829 --> 18:18.398
but it's the best
we got.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.333
You could be
overfeeding them.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.202
Do you think the
water smells weird?

18:22.235 --> 18:23.870
Or someone
else could be.

18:23.903 --> 18:27.240
Or maybe it's just
our funny way of
warning people

18:27.274 --> 18:29.576
they're entering
the house of death.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.611
Are you really
a good nurse?

18:31.644 --> 18:33.413
( sighs )

18:33.446 --> 18:35.282
I'm technically proficient

18:35.315 --> 18:37.550
despite certain
attitude issues.

18:37.584 --> 18:41.188
Well, then maybe I should have
stayed in Milwaukee.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.789
Is that where
your dad is?

18:42.822 --> 18:44.491
He moved away.

18:44.524 --> 18:48.195
My parents are getting
divorced.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.497
Sorry.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.531
It sucks big-time.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.266
Mmm.

18:53.300 --> 18:57.204
Well, you know,
you get to double up
on presents, right?

18:57.237 --> 18:58.438
Christmas,
and your birthday.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.506
I guess.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.807
Then there's always the fun

19:00.840 --> 19:02.509
of playing one
against the other.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.777
Well, actually,
I did that before, anyway.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.513
Now I just live with my mom.

19:06.546 --> 19:09.882
You know, moms can be cool.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.784
I grew up with just a mom.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.220
And it was good?

19:15.422 --> 19:16.389
Yes.

19:16.423 --> 19:17.590
Have you seen Phil?

19:17.624 --> 19:18.558
No.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.859
Her labs aren't back?

19:19.892 --> 19:20.860
Not yet.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.729
Whatever she says about pet care

19:22.762 --> 19:23.896
disregard.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.398
Yeah, I kind of
got that idea.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.333
Thanks.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.734
Hey, Ken

19:27.767 --> 19:29.736
where do you keep
the oral contrast?

19:29.769 --> 19:31.538
What, did you lose
a drunk again?

19:31.571 --> 19:32.639
Try the hall.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.580
Oh... uh...

19:40.613 --> 19:45.585
( clears throat ):
...excuse me.

19:45.618 --> 19:46.719
( sighs )

19:49.556 --> 19:51.558
I, uh, misplaced an x-ray.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.526
Did you find it?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.528
I've checked everywhere.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.307
Boy, I keeping walking
through the wrong doors today.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.441
Luka and UTI mom?

20:08.475 --> 20:10.543
Yeah. Is this
kind of thing

20:10.577 --> 20:11.544
normal in Croatia?

20:11.578 --> 20:12.745
Oh, yeah.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.314
They call it
alternative medicine.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.382
( laughs )

20:15.415 --> 20:16.549
I'm not supposed to laugh.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.584
It's a patient's mother.

20:17.617 --> 20:18.818
Where did you find them?

20:18.851 --> 20:20.553
In the storage
closet in radiology.

20:20.587 --> 20:21.921
That's so strange.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.291
Neuro's so much
more cozy.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.525
Is that what
you two were like?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.360
No. We stuck to beds mostly.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.528
Too bad.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.629
I think you should talk to him.

20:29.662 --> 20:30.963
Me? Forget it.
You know him better.

20:30.997 --> 20:31.898
You walked
in on him.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.533
I'm not the sex police.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.767
Do we have
the labs back
on Hernandez?

20:34.801 --> 20:36.403
Optho can't
give a good assessment

20:36.436 --> 20:38.638
until we've identified
the cause of vision loss.

20:38.671 --> 20:39.772
Here you go.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.308
What's his blood
alcohol level?

20:41.341 --> 20:42.409
None detected.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.510
I'm going
for coffee.

20:43.543 --> 20:44.677
Does anybody
want anything?

20:44.711 --> 20:45.845
Uh-uh.

20:45.878 --> 20:48.014
No, I'm good. Thanks.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.583
No methanol
or ethanol in his system.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.452
What about
tricyclics?
Tox screen's negative.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.354
Well, I did think
of something else.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.456
There's an antimalarial used
in the service.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.457
Quinine.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.591
Yeah. Something
he might

20:58.625 --> 20:59.692
have access to,
and it wouldn't

20:59.726 --> 21:01.328
be detectable in a tox screen.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.695
He'd have to take
a lot of quinine

21:02.729 --> 21:04.431
to get that sick.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.466
I know.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.034
You want me to talk to him?

21:08.067 --> 21:09.569
No.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.338
Why don't you let
Gallant handle it?

21:11.338 --> 21:12.405
Mm.

21:12.439 --> 21:16.443
Give it your best shot, Mikey.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.511
( chuckling )

21:18.545 --> 21:20.780
You may actually come
see Milwaukee sometime.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.482
Yeah, I hear
they have good beer.

21:22.515 --> 21:23.650
( chuckling )

21:23.683 --> 21:24.951
You're very
informed

21:24.984 --> 21:26.753
about U.S.
regional
consumables.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.555
Excuse me, Dr. Kovac?

21:28.588 --> 21:29.789
Yeah.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.624
Um, I'll be back
when her labs are in.

21:31.658 --> 21:32.959
Yeah, okay.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.527
Can we discharge
this patient?

21:34.561 --> 21:36.429
They've been here
for over four hours.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.631
Yeah, we're still waiting
on a chem seven.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.833
I saw the chart.
It looks like
a simple UTI.

21:40.867 --> 21:43.436
I'm concerned
about vesicoureteral reflux.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.905
Luka, come on.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.374
What?

21:47.374 --> 21:48.441
Well, let's clear
this patient

21:48.475 --> 21:49.576
as soon as possible.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.411
Her workup is
not finished.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.579
Well, her mother's is.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.381
And unless
you have unusual stamina

21:54.414 --> 21:56.383
there's no further reason
to keep them here.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.386
The girl's at risk for
renal insufficiency.

21:59.386 --> 22:00.687
( sighs )

22:00.720 --> 22:02.522
Okay, what I'm trying
to say is

22:02.555 --> 22:05.525
that when you're waiting
on a patient's results

22:05.558 --> 22:07.560
it's not necessary
for you to boff

22:07.594 --> 22:09.496
that patient's mother
in the storage closet.

22:09.529 --> 22:10.797
Oh.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.098
Get the labs back.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.132
Write a scrip.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.501
Dispo the girl.

22:18.037 --> 22:21.508
Chemistries
on your little girl.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.643
Is she a renal patient?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.745
Oh.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.782
She is now.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.656
Did my girl call back?

22:36.689 --> 22:37.890
Not yet.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.492
I guess she won't then.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.027
How's your vision?

22:41.060 --> 22:42.495
I'm starting
to see shapes.

22:42.529 --> 22:45.432
You get my peepers going,
I'll be fine.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.500
So, you were
in the Philippines, right?

22:47.534 --> 22:48.535
Before Pakistan, yeah.

22:48.568 --> 22:49.869
You ever hear of quinine?

22:49.902 --> 22:51.003
What about it?

22:51.037 --> 22:52.905
The service
gives it out

22:52.939 --> 22:54.106
to prevent malaria.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.442
So?

22:55.442 --> 22:56.643
It also induces blindness

22:56.676 --> 22:58.077
when ingested
in large quantities.

22:58.110 --> 22:59.679
Maybe they gave me too much
overseas.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.881
This would have been something
you ingested

23:01.914 --> 23:04.451
in the last
12 hours, Felix.

23:07.119 --> 23:09.456
Maybe because
you found out something

23:09.456 --> 23:10.490
when you got home.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.459
Like about your girl maybe.

23:12.459 --> 23:13.826
You don't know anything
about me.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.595
Look, I know that
when you're in combat

23:15.628 --> 23:17.464
home is the only thing
that keeps you going.

23:17.464 --> 23:18.665
Okay, you want
everything to
be the same

23:18.698 --> 23:19.632
when you get back.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.601
Are you a shrink or a doctor?

23:21.634 --> 23:23.903
Only it's not,
and it's like
what's the point?

23:23.936 --> 23:25.171
Felix, man, to
make you better

23:25.204 --> 23:26.639
I got to know
what made you sick.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.140
When you're in country

23:28.174 --> 23:30.610
it's easy to forget
that life keeps going.

23:30.643 --> 23:31.611
Sometimes without you.

23:31.644 --> 23:34.514
Elena?

23:34.547 --> 23:37.484
She waited for me a long time.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.719
I guess she got tired
of waiting.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.589
Just fix me up, okay?

23:42.622 --> 23:44.791
Just fix it.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.726
All right.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.561
We'll get you some
bicarbonate to, uh...

23:48.595 --> 23:49.596
( clears throat )

23:49.629 --> 23:51.498
...eliminate
the toxins.

23:51.498 --> 23:54.033
And I'll, uh, get
somebody down here
to talk to you.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.535
I'm Special Forces.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.504
This gets out,
I'm through.

23:57.504 --> 24:00.640
Look, Felix, I'm-I'm concerned
about getting you healthy.

24:00.673 --> 24:03.610
It was a split second.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.947
Please.

24:09.248 --> 24:10.683
Okay. Um...

24:10.717 --> 24:12.118
( clears throat )

24:12.151 --> 24:14.153
If I can put you
in touch with a clinic...

24:14.186 --> 24:16.022
I'll do the counseling,
I promise.

24:16.055 --> 24:17.924
Look, I'll follow
it up, Felix.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.058
You won't have to.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.195
I'll be okay this time.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.867
Hey, have they croaked yet?

24:27.900 --> 24:28.935
Your fish?

24:28.968 --> 24:30.202
Honey.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.539
I'm much better
with human patients.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.073
You must not
be a Pisces.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.542
Okay, just for that

24:35.575 --> 24:38.210
you're getting meat loaf
for lunch today.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.713
JANET:
Oh, we were wondering
where you went.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.715
Marlene's blood tests

24:42.749 --> 24:44.617
are back.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.553
They show a high
creatinine level
consistent

24:46.586 --> 24:47.954
with chronic renal failure

24:47.987 --> 24:49.722
and we need to send her
for an ultrasound.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.758
But I thought you said
it didn't look like anything.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.159
No. It's still not clear.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.694
That's why we need
to image the kidneys

24:54.727 --> 24:56.563
and bladder.
A renal ultrasound is fast.

24:56.596 --> 24:57.897
It's very easy,
and it'll help us

24:57.930 --> 24:59.932
figure out what
the problem is.

24:59.966 --> 25:01.267
But I thought it was
just an infection.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.703
That's what we
were hoping for.

25:03.736 --> 25:04.771
And...

25:04.804 --> 25:06.105
it's completely painless

25:06.138 --> 25:07.907
so you don't have
to be afraid of anything.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.642
Well, that's as long
as I'm not a fish.

25:09.676 --> 25:10.943
( laughing ):
That's right.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.311
Ready to go
for a spin?

25:12.344 --> 25:13.913
It's okay, Mom.
They're just going

25:13.946 --> 25:15.281
to take some
pictures.
Okay.

25:15.314 --> 25:16.716
You better call Dad.
All right.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.217
Hey, can you pop
a wheelie again?

25:18.250 --> 25:19.952
Sure, if you'll hold on tight.
Okay.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.621
Should I be scared?

25:21.654 --> 25:24.156
It won't make it any easier.

25:29.996 --> 25:32.064
It's going to be
like a ride, right?

25:32.098 --> 25:34.100
Kind of.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.068
I bet you say that
to all the kids.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.670
( laughs )

25:37.704 --> 25:39.138
Can I have some
Brevital in two?

25:39.171 --> 25:40.773
Sure.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.008
Dislocated elbow?

25:42.041 --> 25:44.677
Mm-hmm.

25:44.711 --> 25:45.945
How long you on for?

25:45.978 --> 25:48.681
I have to stick around
for the shift change.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.349
I can hang around.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.684
How does, uh...

25:51.718 --> 25:54.253
a couple of burgers,
some shakes

25:54.286 --> 25:57.289
and maybe see
if you get lucky sound?

25:57.323 --> 25:58.791
I haven't had an
offer that good

25:58.825 --> 26:00.026
since the
eighth grade.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.293
Yeah, but I'm treating.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.329
13-year-old girls
never treat.

26:03.362 --> 26:04.864
In boarding school they do.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.633
Well, make me
a counter-offer.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.168
Are you, uh...

26:09.201 --> 26:10.970
out of Brevital?

26:11.003 --> 26:14.040
Only Versed.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.942
Plus 200 of Fent.

26:15.975 --> 26:19.311
We going to talk
about this?

26:19.345 --> 26:20.647
Carter?

26:20.647 --> 26:21.981
I got a patient
waiting.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.349
Okay, is this, uh,
"backing off"

26:23.382 --> 26:25.785
because if I get to choose,
I prefer "butting in."

26:25.818 --> 26:28.020
Yeah, I think
I took care of
that this morning.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.321
Who?
I think I blew
your cover.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.190
I don't care about that.
Then what?

26:31.223 --> 26:32.792
I just want us
to be clear, that's all.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.260
Well, I think
it's pretty clear.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.227
My time sheet.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.362
Why are you giving me that?

26:36.395 --> 26:37.864
You're the Nurse Manager,
right?

26:37.897 --> 26:39.031
No, I'm not.

26:39.065 --> 26:40.266
Oh, uh, guess again.
Memo from Weaver.

26:40.299 --> 26:41.834
What?

26:41.868 --> 26:44.370
Weren't you
supposed to
see her today?

26:44.403 --> 26:46.706
Yeah, I kind of dodged that.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.207
Oh, funny how
that happens.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.876
I had rounds.

26:49.909 --> 26:51.310
You kids fighting?

26:51.343 --> 26:52.679
Shut up, Jerry.

26:52.712 --> 26:53.946
You should
talk to her.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.414
What? I'm just

26:55.447 --> 26:58.751
trying to help navigate
love's wavy waters.

26:58.785 --> 27:01.988
What do you people
have against paper?

27:02.021 --> 27:03.956
Hey, Jerry, what's
the guard there for?

27:03.990 --> 27:05.091
Uh, psych hold.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.192
What? Why?

27:06.225 --> 27:07.694
The guy's suicidal.

27:07.694 --> 27:09.696
They're moving him up
to a locked ward.

27:09.696 --> 27:11.230
Do you have his chart?

27:11.263 --> 27:14.333
Yeah, it's right here.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.869
Where's Pratt?

27:16.903 --> 27:18.404
Try Curtain two.

27:18.437 --> 27:20.707
I'll be right back,
Mr. Geary.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.041
Don't throw up just yet.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.811
Do you know where Dr. Pratt is?

27:24.844 --> 27:26.245
Uh, Exam one
with the Valium OD.

27:26.278 --> 27:27.880
PRATT:
ABG results?

27:27.914 --> 27:29.415
MALIK:
Yeah, it's on
the clipboard.

27:29.448 --> 27:30.750
You re-did the Hernandez chart?

27:30.783 --> 27:32.451
Get RT to
drop to 80%

27:32.484 --> 27:35.421
and check her
gas in an hour.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.224
Because you marked it
accidental.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.258
So what?

27:39.291 --> 27:40.326
So?

27:40.359 --> 27:41.728
Nobody takes
that many pills

27:41.728 --> 27:43.295
without meaning
to off themselves.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.264
Look, that was not
your call to make.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.999
What's your problem,
brother man?

27:47.033 --> 27:48.167
I'm trying to
watch your back.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.368
You know, I have a lot
of brothers.

27:49.401 --> 27:50.803
I don't need another one.

27:50.837 --> 27:53.072
Don't need a malpractice suit,
either.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.473
Why are you always riding me?

27:54.506 --> 27:57.309
You need to learn
when to stick up for yourself.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.444
( scoffs )

27:58.477 --> 28:00.446
I told Kayson
what I thought.

28:00.479 --> 28:02.982
You didn't make him hear you.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.283
Look, okay,
you know what?

28:04.316 --> 28:05.351
I do things

28:05.384 --> 28:06.753
the way I do things, okay?

28:06.786 --> 28:08.254
You and me--
we're different.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.022
No, no, no. We're
not that different.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.490
We're both trying
to fit in here.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.459
The only difference
is that I'm doing it

28:13.492 --> 28:16.295
by being a man.

28:16.328 --> 28:17.496
Hey, Gallant,
Stella's crashing.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.998
Come on, Stella.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.399
Watch it.
Hey, help me
get her up.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.034
Watch it, watch it!

28:22.068 --> 28:23.235
One, two, three.

28:23.269 --> 28:24.336
( grunting )

28:24.370 --> 28:25.437
GALLANT:
Come on, Stella, wake up.

28:25.471 --> 28:26.472
Gal's looking a little white.

28:26.505 --> 28:27.807
Abby go get
a crash cart.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.008
Shouldn't we move her
to a room?

28:29.041 --> 28:30.209
Get a cart. Start
compressions.

28:30.242 --> 28:31.510
GALLANT:
Come on, Stella,
wake up.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.979
Wake up.

28:33.012 --> 28:35.047
What was her diagnosis?
Unstable angina.

28:35.081 --> 28:36.382
Shouldn't she have been
on a monitor?

28:36.415 --> 28:40.086
CARTER:
Gallant, take
the paddles.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.788
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
V-fib.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.355
Charging to 200. Clear.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.524
LOCKHART:
No change.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.826
300.

28:47.459 --> 28:48.160
Clear.

28:49.395 --> 28:50.997
Jerry, page Kayson.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.065
Okay, should we push epi?

28:53.099 --> 28:54.500
You really want to do this here?

28:54.533 --> 28:56.368
CARTER:
Can you start a line?
Carter.

28:56.402 --> 28:59.305
Uh, all right, yeah,
let's move her.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.907
Go, go, go, go, go!

29:00.940 --> 29:02.008
Come on, man.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.810
Come on, man,
we got to roll.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.377
Out of the
way, everybody.

29:05.411 --> 29:06.979
Watch it, watch it.

29:08.915 --> 29:11.383
Lidocaine's on board.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.085
Second bolus
of 50 going in.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.286
Still V-fib.
360 again.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.322
LOCKHART:
Charged.
Clear.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.093
Resume compressions.

29:21.127 --> 29:22.461
Hang a gram
of Pronestyl?

29:22.494 --> 29:24.864
You should push it.
He's right.

29:24.897 --> 29:26.398
Decreased breath sounds
on the left.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.399
You put the tube in

29:27.433 --> 29:28.534
too far.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.169
22 centimeters at the lips.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.337
It's in the right mainstem.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.272
I just put the balloon
past the cords.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.140
Pull it back to 20.

29:34.173 --> 29:35.407
That might pull it out.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.409
Just do it.
Ah, the girl who cried wolf.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.045
PRATT:
V-fib arrest.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.980
How long she been down?

29:41.013 --> 29:42.481
CARTER:
12 minutes.
Charge to 360.

29:42.514 --> 29:43.349
Charged and ready.

29:43.382 --> 29:43.916
Clear.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.188
Dermabond
looks good.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.322
That's nice.

29:50.356 --> 29:51.390
CT?

29:51.423 --> 29:52.458
Negative.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.026
Negative?
Is that okay?

29:54.060 --> 29:55.427
You're fine, Thomas

29:55.461 --> 29:57.163
but we had to remove
Margaret's spleen.

29:57.196 --> 29:58.430
She has some
liver damage.

29:58.464 --> 29:59.531
It caused a lot
of bleeding

29:59.565 --> 30:00.933
and for a while

30:00.967 --> 30:02.401
her blood pressure
was very low.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.503
Hmm. Oh, that's not good.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.605
No. We had to put her
on a breathing machine.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.474
A ventilator.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.442
We're not sure
when she'll be able
to come off it.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.111
Oh, dear.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.113
Would you like
to go and see her?

30:14.146 --> 30:15.281
I can take you up.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.515
See who?

30:16.548 --> 30:18.017
Margaret, your wife.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.886
My wife couldn't come today.

30:19.919 --> 30:22.388
Yes, Thomas.

30:22.421 --> 30:23.489
She's upstairs.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.324
Margaret.

30:25.357 --> 30:27.026
Margaret? Margaret who?

30:27.059 --> 30:30.562
Thomas, do you remember
why you're here?

30:30.596 --> 30:32.364
Oh, I remember.

30:32.398 --> 30:35.501
I remember everything.

30:39.371 --> 30:40.572
GALLANT:
Charge to 360.

30:40.606 --> 30:41.908
LOCKHART:
Good to go.
Clear.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.175
( zap and flatline alarms )

30:43.209 --> 30:44.376
Asystole.
Okay.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.378
It's been
39 minutes.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.449
360 again.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.485
360!

30:53.519 --> 30:54.520
It's done.

30:54.553 --> 30:58.157
Call it.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.459
Time of death, 16:57.

31:02.561 --> 31:06.398
Is there any
family we need
to talk to?

31:06.432 --> 31:09.468
Uh... nobody.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.437
She didn't have nobody.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.305
Frequent flyer with
atypical presentation.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.241
99 times out of 100

31:15.274 --> 31:16.475
nothing happens to this patient.

31:16.508 --> 31:17.509
You go with the odds.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.078
If you like to gamble.

31:19.111 --> 31:21.180
Sometimes there's nothing else
you can do.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.514
You'll learn that soon enough.

31:22.548 --> 31:25.517
Progressive
symptoms of,
uh, dyspnea

31:25.551 --> 31:27.086
suggesting
cardiac ischemia.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.287
Gallant.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.557
I let you miss the signs.

31:31.590 --> 31:32.591
She was a batty

31:32.624 --> 31:34.093
self-medicating
hypochondriac.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.162
Who you did not feel
like dealing with.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.163
Let it go now.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.497
If she had been admitted

31:38.530 --> 31:40.299
we could have
picked up the V tach.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.201
We could have gotten her back
with early cardioversion.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.269
If you felt
that strongly

31:43.302 --> 31:44.470
about it, maybe you should

31:44.503 --> 31:46.038
have spoken up.
He tried to.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.439
Is anyone to talking to you?

31:47.473 --> 31:48.674
Dr. Kayson,
with all due respect

31:48.707 --> 31:50.276
you're the Chief
of Cardiology.

31:50.309 --> 31:52.078
Gallant is a fourth year
medical student.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.180
Exactly, and I offered him
my expertise and guidance.

31:55.581 --> 31:57.516
And what did it get me?

31:57.549 --> 31:59.051
What did it get her?

31:59.085 --> 32:00.419
Nothing!

32:00.452 --> 32:01.620
She is dead!

32:01.653 --> 32:02.521
Easy, son.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.458
I am not your son.

32:06.492 --> 32:07.726
Pratt, take him for a walk.

32:07.759 --> 32:08.594
Come on, let's go.

32:08.627 --> 32:09.695
All right.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.197
PRATT:
You said everything.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.398
Are you training doctors
or pit bulls?

32:12.431 --> 32:13.699
You're pissed off,
that's okay.

32:13.732 --> 32:15.401
He's upset with her loss.
Maybe you should

32:15.434 --> 32:16.635
have put her on a monitor.

32:16.668 --> 32:17.736
Maybe you should
have paid

32:17.769 --> 32:19.438
a little bit
more attention.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.673
Patient care is all about
taking calculated risks.

32:21.707 --> 32:22.674
Go and fight
the man?

32:22.708 --> 32:24.010
I thought it was about

32:24.043 --> 32:25.244
taking care of the patient.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.578
Let it go,
and learn from it.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.280
GALLANT:
Get up off me.
I'm on your side.

32:28.314 --> 32:29.515
It's really something

32:29.548 --> 32:31.417
the way you guys
stick together down here.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.386
Mikey, listen, what
you did in there--

32:34.420 --> 32:35.554
that was a man.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.023
That's what
being a man is.

32:37.056 --> 32:39.391
Come here,
listen to me.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.060
Guys, come on.
CARTER:
Let's all calm down.

32:42.061 --> 32:43.029
Oh.

32:43.062 --> 32:46.098
Do not call me Mikey.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.309
Lucky I know
how to take a punch.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.677
So that's what you
were doing on the floor.

32:58.710 --> 32:59.678
Hey, how's that feel?

32:59.711 --> 33:01.313
You should see
the other guy.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.714
Maybe I should
go talk to him.

33:02.748 --> 33:04.583
I'd wait a bit on that.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.418
WEAVER:
Susan, can you get
the nursing schedules together

33:06.452 --> 33:07.786
for Abby to work on.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.655
I was hall monitor for
a day in fifth grade

33:09.688 --> 33:12.258
and they fired me for selling
passes to the other kids.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.459
Well, I'm sure
you've matured since.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.261
Not that much, really.

33:15.294 --> 33:17.596
It's my understanding that
the position comes with a raise.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.365
It's not the money.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.433
If it was about the money
why would I be working here?

33:21.467 --> 33:24.203
Look, the Director of Nursing is
on board with my recommendation.

33:24.236 --> 33:25.671
The job is yours,
like it or not.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.706
"Like it or not"?

33:27.739 --> 33:29.108
I don't care to argue about it.

33:29.141 --> 33:30.709
Okay, how much?

33:30.742 --> 33:31.743
Excuse me?

33:31.777 --> 33:33.179
How much is the raise?

33:33.212 --> 33:34.446
I'll get back to you.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.148
LEWIS:
Kerry.

33:36.182 --> 33:38.084
Romano sent this.

33:42.688 --> 33:43.689
What'd it say?

33:44.690 --> 33:47.626
"Your 15 minutes
is up."

33:47.659 --> 33:50.162
( chuckling )

33:58.370 --> 34:01.173
Hey, Pratt wants you to hit him
on the other side of his face

34:01.207 --> 34:02.774
kind of even it out.

34:02.808 --> 34:06.345
You know, she had
a daughter who died
in a car crash

34:06.378 --> 34:11.550
and she's been
alone since then.

34:11.583 --> 34:14.620
You know, Kayson knows
what happened in here today.

34:14.652 --> 34:17.688
Yeah, he was right,
I backed down.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.658
That's not
how I saw it.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.659
Well, I always
back down.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.795
We're supposed to be
saving people's lives

34:23.829 --> 34:25.731
and sometimes
it just seems like

34:25.764 --> 34:27.565
we end up
fighting each other.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.568
I mean, I should...

34:29.601 --> 34:31.670
I should
have fought for her.

34:31.703 --> 34:35.440
I could have tried harder
with Kayson, too.

34:38.543 --> 34:40.478
Nah, she was
my patient.

34:40.512 --> 34:43.782
You know,
she trusted me.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.552
And she'd be
alive now

34:46.585 --> 34:49.455
if I wasn't so scared
of being wrong.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.489
Everybody gets scared.

34:51.523 --> 34:52.724
Not Pratt.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.460
( chuckles )

34:55.494 --> 34:56.895
Sure he does.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.798
Why do you think he acts
so cocky all the time?

34:59.831 --> 35:02.368
Everybody that
comes in here does

35:02.401 --> 35:04.203
but you learn
to work through it.

35:04.236 --> 35:06.238
And when does that happen?

35:06.272 --> 35:09.275
As soon as
you've killed a patient.

35:13.479 --> 35:14.813
Well, I just did.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.651
No, you didn't.

35:19.685 --> 35:22.188
Maybe you won't have to.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.761
Don't stay in here for too long.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.409
Marlene's ultrasound
came back positive

35:43.442 --> 35:45.211
for bilateral
renal scarring.

35:45.244 --> 35:46.745
Are her kidneys shot?

35:46.778 --> 35:47.713
I don't know.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.281
She definitely needs surgery.

35:49.315 --> 35:50.949
All those UTIs
back in Milwaukee

35:50.982 --> 35:52.684
and nobody
ever caught it?

35:52.718 --> 35:54.286
( sighs )

35:54.320 --> 35:55.387
Yeah.

35:55.421 --> 35:56.922
Somebody should have.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.690
VCUG first?

35:58.724 --> 36:00.492
Let's start her on Gentamycin.

36:00.526 --> 36:01.860
And the moral
of the story is...

36:01.893 --> 36:04.863
Never sleep with
a patient's mother.

36:04.896 --> 36:06.932
At least not until
the labs are back.

36:06.965 --> 36:09.735
Oh...

36:09.768 --> 36:11.703
You know, a little girl's sick.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.872
Next to that,
nothing much matters.

36:13.905 --> 36:15.807
Yeah.

36:18.810 --> 36:19.711
Janet?
Yeah?

36:19.745 --> 36:21.380
Can I speak
to you?

36:23.482 --> 36:26.252
Hey, Chuni, can you do me a
favor and mix me a bag of Gent?

36:26.252 --> 36:27.653
Sure, what room?

36:27.686 --> 36:28.954
I'll take it there
if you just get me started.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.289
All right.
Thanks.

36:32.691 --> 36:33.792
Hey.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.429
Hey.

36:37.463 --> 36:38.897
I thought
you were on till 7:00.

36:38.930 --> 36:41.533
Deb's covering the shift change.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.474
I'll call you later.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.309
Okay, hey.

36:50.342 --> 36:52.811
I'm not really sure
what we're not talking about.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.713
Can't this wait until
we're both off duty?

36:54.746 --> 36:55.747
Who's angry at who?

36:55.781 --> 36:56.782
I'm not angry
at you.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.650
Okay, and I never lied to you.

36:58.684 --> 37:01.587
Well, then I guess I must have
talked myself into something.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.754
Well let's figure it out.

37:02.788 --> 37:05.357
No, I agreed
not to rescue you

37:05.391 --> 37:06.458
or help you
or fix you

37:06.492 --> 37:07.793
so I'm just going to shut up

37:07.826 --> 37:09.628
and wait for the car wreck.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.365
Wait a minute.
What is that supposed to mean?

37:13.399 --> 37:14.933
Come on, Abby, we both
know where this is going.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.568
No, I don't.

37:16.602 --> 37:18.770
And, you know, everything
would have been fine

37:18.804 --> 37:20.372
if you had just come to me...

37:20.406 --> 37:21.973
in the first place.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.842
Well, then I'm the
overprotective boyfriend.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.612
ABBY:
You know, I'm not drinking
to get drunk.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.814
I'm hardly drinking at all.

37:28.847 --> 37:29.748
Good night.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.483
Okay, wait.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.319
Do you want to know how much
I've been drinking?

37:33.352 --> 37:34.420
Last night I had two beers.

37:34.453 --> 37:35.854
Wednesday I had a cosmo.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.623
Last week I had nothing.

37:37.656 --> 37:38.724
The week before that

37:38.757 --> 37:40.359
I had a beer and a pink drink.

37:40.392 --> 37:41.627
I don't know what it was.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.928
You're keeping
very close track.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.430
Yeah, because
it's under control.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.898
Well... I just
don't understand

37:46.932 --> 37:48.567
why you'd want
to go back to that?

37:48.600 --> 37:50.336
I was drinking last year,
you knew that.

37:50.336 --> 37:51.870
Well, it was
a little different then.

37:51.903 --> 37:54.873
Yeah, now it's not about
being scared and alone.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.074
It's still drinking.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.843
Look, look, wait.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.878
I used to drink
because I was miserable.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.913
I was in a lousy marriage

38:01.947 --> 38:04.816
and a life I didn't want,
and now I'm happy.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.918
With you, things are good.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.588
And being able to have
a casual drink with my friends

38:09.621 --> 38:11.790
just makes me feel like
I'm past the bad part.

38:11.823 --> 38:12.858
Okay.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.428
You know, maybe...

38:16.462 --> 38:19.531
maybe I just have a little bit
more faith in me than you do.

38:19.565 --> 38:20.866
Oh, is that how
you translate my concern--

38:20.899 --> 38:21.900
as not having faith?

38:21.933 --> 38:22.768
I don't know.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.404
Yeah.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.475
Carter.

38:32.444 --> 38:33.879
Forget it,
let's not do this.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.681
All right, look,
I'm a pro at walking away.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.048
I've done it one million times

38:37.082 --> 38:40.386
and I'm asking you,
please, don't do this.

38:40.419 --> 38:41.887
Stay here
and talk to me.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.778
CHEN:
Uh, what about the girl in one?

39:06.812 --> 39:08.447
LOCKHART:
Alisha Murphy,
she's off the vent.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.815
And the guy in two?

39:09.848 --> 39:11.750
He's still puking up
his shrimp platter.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.419
Oh, uh, mm.

39:13.419 --> 39:16.488
KOVAC:
A transplant would
only be a last resort.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.425
I should, um...

39:19.458 --> 39:22.794
I should call my husband.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.730
There's a phone right there.

39:30.802 --> 39:32.003
I'm sorry.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.640
Could I have
some privacy, please?

39:35.941 --> 39:38.444
Yeah, sure.

39:40.612 --> 39:41.913
Hello there.

39:41.947 --> 39:44.783
If you want to know
what I want for my last meal

39:44.816 --> 39:45.884
the answer's pizza.

39:45.917 --> 39:48.687
Well, your kidney
is sick.

39:48.720 --> 39:49.988
We're going to give
you some medicine

39:50.021 --> 39:51.457
to help stop
the infection

39:51.490 --> 39:52.958
then the doctors are
going to figure out

39:52.991 --> 39:55.060
exactly what they need
to do to make it better.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.695
How did I get like this?

39:56.728 --> 39:58.997
It's a genetic
condition, probably.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.466
From my parents?

40:00.466 --> 40:02.534
A combination
of their DNA.

40:02.568 --> 40:03.935
Maybe that's why.

40:03.969 --> 40:07.906
They had a fight one night
and my dad left.

40:07.939 --> 40:10.576
They never told me why,
they just gave up.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.145
Well, I'm sure it
seemed that way.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.915
I think they made a mistake.

40:16.948 --> 40:20.686
Maybe the reason I'm sick is so
I can bring them back together.

40:25.991 --> 40:28.994
I'm going
to give you some medicine...

40:29.027 --> 40:30.929
in your vein.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.798
Might sting
a little bit.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.165
I'm not scared.

40:34.199 --> 40:38.604
I really think
this could fix everything.

40:43.108 --> 40:46.612
Glad to see Romano hasn't
lost his sense of humor.

40:46.645 --> 40:48.847
I've made Abby
the new nurse manager.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.649
Yeah, I heard.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.884
I'd like you to let me know
if she's not satisfying

40:52.918 --> 40:54.720
the responsibilities
of the position.

40:54.753 --> 40:55.821
Okay.

40:55.854 --> 40:57.122
I'd also like you to make sure

40:57.155 --> 40:58.857
that there are
at least two MICN's

40:58.890 --> 41:00.492
and no more than three LVN's
on duty

41:00.526 --> 41:01.927
on any
given shift.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.529
Kerry, is everything okay?

41:03.562 --> 41:06.164
Look, I made a small mistake
on a television program.

41:06.197 --> 41:08.534
I wish everyone
would just get over it.

41:08.534 --> 41:09.635
That's not
what I meant.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.002
In the ladies' room?

41:12.971 --> 41:14.205
Yeah?

41:14.239 --> 41:16.908
You dropped a syringe.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.011
What? No.

41:20.045 --> 41:22.681
Kerry, I know what I saw.

41:24.683 --> 41:26.752
I'm taking hormones.

41:27.786 --> 41:29.154
Good night.

41:29.187 --> 41:30.656
Good night.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.161
Pratt, Jing Mei.

41:36.194 --> 41:37.295
Mm, night.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.798
Watch out for
the paparazzi, Dr. K.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.901
Hey, Gallant,
I understand that

41:42.934 --> 41:44.936
you were involved in
an altercation today.

41:44.970 --> 41:45.971
Uh, yes, ma'am.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.305
You hit another doctor?

41:47.338 --> 41:48.306
Yeah, Dr. Pratt.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.841
Oh.

41:49.875 --> 41:53.812
Well, in that case
I'll overlook it.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.882
Night, Dr. Chen.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.249
Take it easy, Iron Mike.

41:58.283 --> 41:59.585
Hey.

41:59.618 --> 42:00.852
Gallant.

42:00.886 --> 42:02.220
Hey.

42:02.253 --> 42:04.155
Hey, look.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.591
I'm sorry about Hernandez.

42:05.591 --> 42:07.158
Well, you should have
stayed out of it.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.895
Well, you were going from
the gut, which I respect

42:09.928 --> 42:12.163
but for once, I was
the one thinking clearly.

42:12.197 --> 42:14.065
So he went up to Psych?

42:14.099 --> 42:16.334
I'll check on him
before I leave.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.336
How's your face?

42:18.369 --> 42:19.838
Ah, don't even sweat it.

42:19.871 --> 42:20.906
I know it wasn't really me.

42:20.939 --> 42:22.207
You were
punching Kayson.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.610
Uh, actually, no,
it was you.

42:26.311 --> 42:27.312
Hey.

42:27.345 --> 42:30.616
Next time
I hit back.

42:30.649 --> 42:32.818
Yeah.
Tell Leon I said hey.

42:36.354 --> 42:39.157
Ah, all right.

42:39.190 --> 42:42.360
Daddy's back and it's chow time.

42:42.393 --> 42:45.230
Come on. Come on.

42:45.263 --> 42:48.266
Come on, come get some.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.649
You should have
your keys already out.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.654
You never know
who might be lurking.

43:15.927 --> 43:20.732
Look, the drinking...

43:20.766 --> 43:23.969
The drinking is the drinking;
you know where I stand on that.

43:28.206 --> 43:30.308
It's just how far
are we going to go

43:30.341 --> 43:32.678
if we keep
hiding from each other?

43:39.818 --> 43:41.920
I won't hide anymore.

43:41.953 --> 43:43.989
( train passing )

43:50.762 --> 43:55.100
Look, I didn't mean
to leave like that.

43:55.133 --> 43:57.936
It just seemed
kind of complicated

43:57.969 --> 44:00.438
and I wanted
a little time

44:00.471 --> 44:06.111
to figure out where we were.

44:15.020 --> 44:20.191
Here we are.
