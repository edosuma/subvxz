00:02.202 --> 00:04.536
Good evening.

00:04.538 --> 00:07.272
Dobriy vecher.

00:07.274 --> 00:09.508
Good morning.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.676
Dobroye utro.

00:11.678 --> 00:12.677
( On radio ) Dobroye utro.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.145
Thank you!

00:14.147 --> 00:15.647
Spasibo.

00:15.649 --> 00:19.217
( On radio ) Spasibo.

00:19.219 --> 00:22.621
Lanthanoids, lanthanum,

00:22.623 --> 00:25.891
cerium, praseodymium.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.931
During viral transcript--

00:32.933 --> 00:37.102
during the influenza's
viral transcription.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.036
Jonah, you ready to head out?

00:38.038 --> 00:40.539
All set!

00:40.541 --> 00:41.640
During the viral--

00:45.312 --> 00:48.113
( creaking sound )

00:56.089 --> 00:57.989
Dad?

01:00.327 --> 01:02.060
DA--

01:02.062 --> 01:03.094
( knock on door )

01:03.096 --> 01:04.962
Jonah?

01:09.169 --> 01:10.335
( Pounding )

01:10.337 --> 01:13.004
Jonah, are you
all right in there?

01:31.224 --> 01:33.158
Jenkins?

01:33.160 --> 01:35.293
What are you doing here?
It's our day off.

01:35.295 --> 01:37.162
Is that a brain in a jar?

01:37.164 --> 01:39.764
My research doesn't
have a day off.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.367
And it's a brain jar,

01:42.369 --> 01:45.770
what else would one put in it?

01:45.772 --> 01:47.305
What are you doing here?

01:47.307 --> 01:50.141
Have access to every art
portfolio in history.

01:50.143 --> 01:51.977
Where else would I be?

01:55.248 --> 01:56.781
Jenkins, do you have
any more yellow pens?

01:56.783 --> 01:59.284
Second drawer under
the thing that looks

01:59.286 --> 02:02.153
like a space helmet but is not.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.824
She's making her own map
of the ley lines

02:05.826 --> 02:08.627
based on the observation
you've made since

02:08.628 --> 02:10.794
taking up residence here,
blighting my work.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.931
Why are you blighting me today?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.799
I'm researching magical threats,

02:14.801 --> 02:16.668
getting a little sick

02:16.670 --> 02:20.171
of blindly fighting
minotaurs and giant trolls.

02:20.173 --> 02:21.406
( Rattling )

02:21.408 --> 02:24.309
( Whirring )

02:24.311 --> 02:26.344
( Sirens wailing )

02:37.724 --> 02:39.391
Why is everybody here?

02:39.393 --> 02:40.725
Isn't this our day off?

02:40.727 --> 02:42.327
- Yeah.
- Yes.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.298
What is this?

02:47.300 --> 02:48.700
Someone left it
on that doorstep.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.201
( Rattling )

02:57.377 --> 02:59.411
Has it ever done that before?

02:59.413 --> 03:04.182
No.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.118
Must be a magical threat
of truly epic proportions

03:07.120 --> 03:10.855
or something absolutely
apocalyptic going on at the...

03:10.857 --> 03:13.892
The chicagoland stem fair

03:13.894 --> 03:15.927
sponsored by the
McCabe learning foundation.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.729
What the hell is a stem?

03:17.731 --> 03:20.899
Stem? Stem?

03:20.901 --> 03:24.269
Science, technology,
engineering and mathematics!

03:24.271 --> 03:26.371
It's a science fair!
Yes!

03:26.373 --> 03:31.376
Jenkins, give this baby a
spin, we're going to chi town.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.311
( Whirring )

03:35.382 --> 03:39.150
Whoo!

03:39.152 --> 03:42.053
Stem fairs are the cutting
edge of the amateur research.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.723
I'm just saying, what kind of
magical world-ending apocalypse

03:44.725 --> 03:48.893
could possibly happen at a
cheesy high school science fair?

03:55.435 --> 03:58.436
Robotics.

03:58.438 --> 04:00.772
These kids take science
very seriously.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.240
God, yes.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.310
Blood on the floor,
best mind wins.

04:05.312 --> 04:08.947
Participants and spectators,

04:08.949 --> 04:12.751
welcome to the 6th annual
chicagoland stem fair,

04:12.753 --> 04:16.521
brought to you by the McCabe
learning foundation.

04:16.523 --> 04:20.125
Please welcome our title sponsor
and foundation president,

04:20.127 --> 04:25.497
science education
expert Lucinda McCabe.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.898
Whoo-hoo!

04:26.900 --> 04:28.433
- Hi.
- Whoo-hoo!

04:32.806 --> 04:35.273
Hello, everyone.

04:35.275 --> 04:39.978
Our organization,
the McCabe learning foundation,

04:39.980 --> 04:45.917
is committed to encouraging and
rewarding academic excellence.

04:45.919 --> 04:49.120
This is why, along with
our corporate partners,

04:49.122 --> 04:53.224
we support the chicagoland
stem fair and other

04:53.226 --> 04:55.293
science events like it
throughout the country.

04:55.295 --> 05:00.031
We will not only be rewarding
the winners today

05:00.033 --> 05:02.567
with full college scholarships

05:02.569 --> 05:07.472
but also internships and
even research grants.

05:07.474 --> 05:11.543
Like we always say in
stem world, "science..."

05:11.545 --> 05:13.478
"Works!"

05:13.480 --> 05:14.445
Whoo!

05:16.016 --> 05:17.448
I love that.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.384
I know.

05:19.386 --> 05:22.854
Robots, semiconductors,
virtual reality.

05:22.856 --> 05:26.090
Whatever happened to a good old
fashioned baking soda volcano?

05:26.092 --> 05:30.328
Paper mache volcano with baking
soda, a little vinegar, psss.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.864
Okay, stem fairs are
where the best and brightest

05:32.866 --> 05:34.265
come to show off the future.

05:34.267 --> 05:37.001
They are so far beyond
baking soda volcanoes.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.004
I like a baking soda volcano.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.139
Hello.
Hi, there.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.941
I'm Lucinda McCabe.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.410
Are you all parents
or family members?

05:45.412 --> 05:47.412
Oh, hi.
How are you?

05:47.414 --> 05:48.580
- Yeah.
- Good.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.281
We are the librarians.

05:50.283 --> 05:53.284
Oh, you're the judges from
the county library. Welcome.

05:53.286 --> 05:56.387
I'm so glad you were able to find
it okay with the directions.

05:56.389 --> 05:59.190
Your welcome packs are
right over with Mrs. schwager.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.392
So enjoy.

06:01.394 --> 06:05.897
Someday, that cover story
is not going to fly.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.165
All right.
Split up.

06:07.167 --> 06:10.268
Find something magical.

06:10.270 --> 06:13.137
Climatological changes
environmental impact

06:13.139 --> 06:14.906
on shifting migratory
patterns of enhydra lutris.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.941
( Yawns )

06:16.943 --> 06:19.444
As you can see, I'm combining
a multistage ultraviolet

06:19.446 --> 06:21.546
treatment with hybrid silicon
nitrate materials

06:21.548 --> 06:22.580
in the water filtration system.

06:22.582 --> 06:23.615
So cool.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.553
In molecular cloning, the DNA
of the target molecule...

06:28.555 --> 06:31.022
By which she means the subject
of the experiment,

06:31.024 --> 06:32.624
not the target
replication molecule.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.359
Mom.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.928
That DNA is treated with
enzymes and broken down

06:36.930 --> 06:38.563
into smaller DNA chains.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.432
Both ergodic theory and
statistical physics will be

06:41.434 --> 06:44.903
revolutionized by my approach
to extremal combinatorics.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.274
It's a baking soda volcano.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.276
Finally!

06:51.278 --> 06:54.312
Hello and welcome
to the world of magma.

06:54.314 --> 06:59.217
My project today is a--
I can't do this.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.152
What's wrong?

07:01.154 --> 07:02.620
I'll tell you what's wrong.

07:02.622 --> 07:05.056
He brought a paper
mache volcano to a--

07:05.058 --> 07:06.057
I'm not even supposed
to be here.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.226
I'm way out of my league.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.295
Uh-uh, no way.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.930
You know what you are, Leonard?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.698
You are an underdog.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.433
I am?

07:15.435 --> 07:18.236
Yes. And all the greats
were underdogs.

07:18.238 --> 07:21.239
Come on, show us what you got.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.052
Good hustle on
the nonradioactive isotopes.

07:34.054 --> 07:39.290
Ooh, vibrational multidynamics,
that's a little hacky.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.259
You were one of these kids.

07:41.261 --> 07:44.963
I don't mean to brag,
but I was a monster.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.998
I had this whole, like,
wall full of trophies.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.633
And I bet you still own
every single one of them.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.202
No, no.

07:51.204 --> 07:54.272
You know, things change.

07:54.274 --> 07:57.175
And some things never change.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.142
- Look at all these.
- Why are we even here?

07:58.144 --> 07:59.978
Nice glasses.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.147
Goths and geeks
should be friends.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.049
High school's like prison.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.719
You find a crew to run with and
keep all the other crews down.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.020
Which crew were you in?

08:14.327 --> 08:16.427
Hey, is that supposed
to do that?

08:16.429 --> 08:18.162
No, I mean were you a goth,
a geek or a cool kid?

08:24.637 --> 08:25.570
( Rumbling )

08:27.207 --> 08:29.040
( Explosion )

08:43.390 --> 08:47.525
Well, is that magical
enough for you?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.530
All right, everything's fine.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.733
Looks like one of our
contestants got

08:55.735 --> 08:58.469
a little too enthusiastic
with his display and

08:58.471 --> 09:01.139
mixed his chemicals
a little too strongly.

09:01.141 --> 09:05.743
It's like we always say, it's not
science until something's on fire.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.715
Even now, that contestant
is getting a firm talking to

09:10.717 --> 09:13.184
by some librarians

09:13.186 --> 09:17.422
who are judges
and also librarians.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.091
Tell us what happened, Leonard.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.093
What happened?

09:22.095 --> 09:24.362
My volcano freaking exploded.
I mean, did you see that?

09:24.364 --> 09:27.065
It was insane.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.199
I need to sit down.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.401
You are sitting down.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.503
Leonard, you know what I think?

09:32.505 --> 09:35.173
I think you created an
amateur-looking project,

09:35.175 --> 09:37.708
so no one would suspect
you were actually competing

09:37.710 --> 09:39.444
and then you used, let us say,

09:39.446 --> 09:42.413
unnatural means to create
an amazing effect to win.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.815
But we're not mad.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.716
You're not?

09:45.718 --> 09:48.119
No, Leonard, we're not.
We're here to help you.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.488
I'm here to help you.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.223
You are?

09:52.225 --> 09:53.458
Yes, Leonard.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.827
I'm here to work
with you to fix this.

09:55.829 --> 10:00.765
I just need you to take
a deep breath,

10:00.767 --> 10:03.701
and tell me the absolute truth.

10:09.442 --> 10:14.745
When you say my name, it's
like a thousand angels singing.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.347
About the volcano,
Leonard, I meant...

10:16.349 --> 10:22.153
- Oh.
- The volcano.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.222
Hey, man.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.890
Her eyes are like opals.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.693
I know, buddy.

10:28.695 --> 10:31.462
Now, what did you mean when you said
you weren't supposed to be here?

10:31.464 --> 10:32.897
I was, like,
the fifth alternate.

10:32.899 --> 10:36.400
I hate these fairs,
but my dad made me enter.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.903
What happened to the five
students ahead of you?

10:38.905 --> 10:40.538
I don't know.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.173
When I got here this morning,
I heard a bunch

10:42.175 --> 10:43.541
of freaky stuff
happened to them.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.443
Jonah Gordon,
he's like Einstein.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.178
He got paralyzed by a virus.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.514
And this other kid,
I heard that she got

10:49.516 --> 10:52.283
an allergy so rare only like one
in ten million people ever get it.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.288
He's telling the truth.

10:57.290 --> 10:57.922
Are you sure?

10:57.924 --> 10:59.824
Yeah.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.430
Hey.

11:06.432 --> 11:08.566
Okay.

11:08.568 --> 11:12.470
Colonel baird says that whoever's
doing this is still out there.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.405
Leonard isn't
the source of the magic.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.407
A hundred contestants,
twice as many spectators,

11:16.409 --> 11:18.309
really narrows things down.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.944
Okay, we need to move
methodically through all

11:19.946 --> 11:21.546
of the displays and find
one that doesn't belong.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.348
Or, we could follow my hunch.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.250
Hunch?

11:26.252 --> 11:27.518
No, no, no, no, no.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.320
Hunch is not
a scientific method.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.922
It's my method.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.757
I'm a librarian, too.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.225
I even had some trophies
myself back in the day.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.294
What did you win?

11:36.296 --> 11:38.429
Win? No.
Stolen.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.964
A whole wall of 'em.

11:46.940 --> 11:47.905
( Camera shutter clicks )

11:50.543 --> 11:52.743
That? It's a
Newton's cradle.

11:52.745 --> 11:55.346
It's an exercise in
conservation of momentum.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.647
Magic.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.716
Oh, I rather doubt that.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.918
- Huh.
- You're out of the annex.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.987
Yes. I was just going
to stand around all day

12:02.989 --> 12:04.355
waiting for you to call,

12:04.357 --> 12:06.424
and then I remembered,
I have free will.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.459
Besides, a science fair?

12:08.461 --> 12:12.263
As an underappreciated, albeit
innovative scientist myself,

12:12.265 --> 12:14.498
I admire these
clever young people.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.701
Splendid.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.936
All right, check it,
this last ball here,

12:18.938 --> 12:22.340
right before the volcano,
it was all floaty-like.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.908
Looks normal now.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.279
- Oh.
- What the?

12:30.950 --> 12:33.618
Huh.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.554
Magic is rewriting
local reality.

12:36.556 --> 12:40.424
The laws of physics in this
auditorium are starting to bend.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.726
So this thing's magic.

12:41.728 --> 12:46.430
No, this is sort of
an early warning device.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.999
But this makes no sense, I mean,
there's already enough power

12:48.001 --> 12:50.034
in play than could be
summoned by a single amateur.

12:52.472 --> 12:56.407
You're looking for a coven, a group
of magic users working together.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.975
How do we find a coven?

12:57.977 --> 13:01.812
Three. Look for
the pattern of three.

13:01.814 --> 13:05.650
Fructose and water
poured over frozen water.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.685
Let's go.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.587
Miraculous.

13:09.589 --> 13:10.888
( Slurps )

13:20.533 --> 13:22.433
Good spot?

13:22.435 --> 13:24.335
Perfect.

13:29.609 --> 13:30.541
Did she say where they went?

13:30.543 --> 13:32.543
Who? Stem-head?

13:32.545 --> 13:35.513
Yeah, she said they passed
the dynamic something project,

13:35.515 --> 13:38.582
and then turned behind the blabidee
blah, blah math theory thingy.

13:38.584 --> 13:39.884
Two lefts and a right.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.726
( Whispering )

13:58.738 --> 14:02.406
Okay, remember, magic is power,

14:02.408 --> 14:04.442
focus, and effect.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.678
The power in this case comes
from the desires of the coven,

14:07.680 --> 14:11.382
the focus, that
could be an artifact,

14:11.384 --> 14:13.617
it could be a spell,
and the effect...

14:13.619 --> 14:15.419
Is like that?

14:16.789 --> 14:19.690
They were all
focused on one girl.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.796
( Sighs )

14:34.374 --> 14:36.507
It's time.
Get your instrument.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.677
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

14:39.679 --> 14:40.845
Hi. Yes.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.747
That girl who was here,
where is she?

14:42.749 --> 14:45.449
Hi. Oh my, you're
the judges, aren't you?

14:45.451 --> 14:47.618
This is Amy meyer's booth.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.754
don't worry, I can take
you through the project.

14:49.756 --> 14:50.788
Please, don't dock
her any points.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.623
( Static, rumbling )

14:52.625 --> 14:54.125
Okay. So...

14:54.127 --> 14:56.994
- Ouch!
- The molecular cloning...

14:58.798 --> 15:00.097
( Sniffs )

15:01.734 --> 15:03.467
( Vocalizing )

15:06.406 --> 15:08.539
Hey, stop what you're doing.

15:08.541 --> 15:09.940
Stop what you're doing.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.813
What are you doing?

15:15.815 --> 15:20.985
I'm asking Amy to
put the past behind us,

15:20.987 --> 15:23.154
and move into
the future with me,

15:23.156 --> 15:25.856
holding only each other's
hands and hearts,

15:25.858 --> 15:27.658
for all eternity.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.462
Dashell, you know
I can't date right now.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.730
School is too important.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.632
Winning this
stem fair comes first.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.768
Just prom, please.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.638
We had something great.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.542
Nothing is more important than
getting into a good college and I...

15:48.581 --> 15:51.682
( Wind blowing, thunder )

16:03.996 --> 16:06.530
Excuse me, Amy meyer,
do you know her?

16:06.532 --> 16:08.632
Are you kidding?

16:08.634 --> 16:10.568
You're not kidding.
Of course.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.870
( Coughs )

16:12.872 --> 16:13.938
( Clears throat )

16:13.940 --> 16:19.743
Yeah, I...

16:19.745 --> 16:21.479
I guess I swallowed a...

16:26.586 --> 16:28.919
Holy shit.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.667
So, what we have established
is that the insects

16:43.669 --> 16:46.604
were in a nest below
the auditorium floor

16:46.606 --> 16:49.273
and they were attracted
to the chemicals

16:49.275 --> 16:52.843
in the student's
experiments, probably.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.613
So the student is now
resting comfortably,

16:55.615 --> 16:56.847
he's at the hospital.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.916
Shouldn't we cancel the fair?

16:58.918 --> 17:02.019
If we do that,
we will have to forfeit

17:02.021 --> 17:04.655
all of these projects
and unfortunately,

17:04.656 --> 17:06.824
we will disqualify your students

17:06.826 --> 17:08.893
from the scholarship
competition.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.994
Or you could just
award it to Amy.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.063
We all know who's going to win.

17:13.065 --> 17:16.767
I think in the true spirit of
science, we will soldier on.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.570
Oh, the librarians.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.306
Have you turned in
your judging slips yet?

17:22.308 --> 17:24.008
Oh, so much to see.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.010
And some distractions.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.810
Can you believe
this year's luck?

17:27.813 --> 17:30.648
First, the entire top rung
of competitors drops out sick,

17:30.650 --> 17:32.816
then there's
that chemical explosion,

17:32.818 --> 17:35.119
and now Tim is swarmed by bugs?

17:35.121 --> 17:38.822
I swear, it's almost like there's a
curse on the stem fair this year.

17:38.824 --> 17:42.026
Hah! Magic, that's funny.

17:42.028 --> 17:44.929
That's it.
Nobody's trying to win.

17:44.931 --> 17:47.031
They're trying to get
everyone else to lose.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.199
That would be an
extraordinarily bad idea.

17:49.201 --> 17:52.803
So, the rule of three
amplifies the spell,

17:52.805 --> 17:53.971
for good or bad.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.807
Any direct harm you do
unto others with

17:56.809 --> 18:01.011
malicious intent will be
visited back upon you threefold.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.813
We think there
are multiple victims.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.716
Then somebody has a wallop
of a backlash coming.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.586
Fatal, at least.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.788
All right, here.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.123
This will help you
find the focus.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.792
There's no way that amateurs,
I don't care how many,

18:14.794 --> 18:16.994
are wielding that kind
of power without a focus,

18:16.996 --> 18:19.830
either artifact or spell.

18:19.832 --> 18:23.601
Are we even sure somebody would go to
these lengths to win a science fair?

18:23.603 --> 18:25.035
Yes. Yes.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.870
These kids live
for this competition.

18:26.872 --> 18:29.006
I mean, it can define
your whole future.

18:29.008 --> 18:32.309
Whoever is using this magic doesn't
know about the rule of three.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.011
They're just trying
to break out from the pack,

18:34.013 --> 18:36.614
make their parents proud.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.782
Look, I know the pressure
that these kids feel.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.785
When I was in school, if someone
had given me a magic wand

18:41.787 --> 18:44.655
or a spell that would've
helped me win the stem fair

18:44.657 --> 18:47.925
or get into a good college,
I would've used it.

18:47.927 --> 18:50.861
But where'd a bunch of science
kids get a magic focus?

18:50.863 --> 18:53.130
Well, it's like tracking a wmd.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.332
Figure out who's using it,
trace it back to the source.

18:55.334 --> 18:58.168
We need intel and all the kids
who might be involved

18:58.170 --> 19:01.839
but from a source who isn't
part of the suspect pool.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.273
I got this.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.777
Hey.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.979
How'd you know I was in here?

19:08.981 --> 19:10.881
Well, this is her place, right?

19:10.883 --> 19:14.051
I mean, this is--
this is her world.

19:14.053 --> 19:16.687
This is where it all started.

19:16.689 --> 19:20.124
You guys had a lab together.

19:20.126 --> 19:24.395
Probably dissected a frog, hmm?

19:24.397 --> 19:26.163
She's reaching
for the scalpel, you...

19:26.165 --> 19:29.099
It was a dumb idea.
She's an Alpha kid.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.902
I'm going through
the most cliched

19:31.904 --> 19:34.905
and un-ironic of
all teenage phases.

19:34.907 --> 19:38.709
I don't belong with her,
the alphas or the sports

19:38.711 --> 19:41.278
or the 420s or the bees.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.987
"She walks in beauty
like the night

19:49.989 --> 19:54.124
of cloudless climes
and starry skies,

19:54.126 --> 19:57.795
and all that's best
of dark and bright

19:57.797 --> 20:02.966
meet in her aspect
and her eyes."

20:02.968 --> 20:08.939
That's lord Byron,
technically a romantic,

20:08.941 --> 20:14.311
but then he pretty much gave gothic
tradition a boost in the early 1800s.

20:14.313 --> 20:16.080
So, what you kids think gothic
is with the--

20:16.082 --> 20:20.184
with the painted fingernails
and the pale--

20:20.186 --> 20:21.151
you know what I'm talking about,

20:21.153 --> 20:25.289
but I mean, he was a badass.

20:25.291 --> 20:29.193
You see, so the jocks
and the alphas and the geeks

20:29.195 --> 20:31.428
and the goths, those are
all the roles we play.

20:31.430 --> 20:35.733
Those are costumes we wear,
and it's just to fit in

20:35.735 --> 20:38.402
with whoever at the time
you want to fit in with.

20:38.404 --> 20:42.773
I bet nobody ever beat
you up for saying poetry.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.208
No, they didn't.
Not for that.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.976
Not for reciting poetry.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.278
You know why?

20:48.280 --> 20:52.182
Because I wore my costume.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.251
I wore it like a second skin.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.122
And I wore it for too long.

20:58.124 --> 21:00.257
- Do you like the girl?
- Yeah.

21:00.259 --> 21:04.962
So then, don't let your costume,
yours or Amy's stop you.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.830
You think?

21:06.832 --> 21:08.031
Yeah.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.266
Tell me about Amy.

21:09.268 --> 21:13.370
Tell me about Amy
and her friends.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.272
All right, so, Tim, the bug boy

21:15.274 --> 21:17.207
who also dated Amy, by the way

21:17.209 --> 21:19.443
who zahir hates
because she won last year,

21:19.445 --> 21:21.311
had forced elysse to
break up their partnership

21:21.313 --> 21:23.013
so she could go
for the gold solo

21:23.015 --> 21:24.481
against the Ortiz twins,

21:24.483 --> 21:26.850
who allegedly, now,
I said allegedly

21:26.852 --> 21:29.086
may or may not have stolen
research from kneisha

21:29.088 --> 21:30.454
which forced her to
switched projects,

21:30.456 --> 21:33.023
so she's going direct
competition with, again,

21:33.025 --> 21:38.862
Tim, Silas and a girl known
only as "the robot chick."

21:38.864 --> 21:41.231
Okay, I take it back.
It's easier to find wmds.

21:41.233 --> 21:42.900
There is one common link.

21:42.902 --> 21:47.337
Everybody except
dashell hates Amy.

21:47.339 --> 21:49.373
Because she's the frontrunner.

21:49.375 --> 21:52.810
Most likely the target
just hasn't been hit yet.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.278
Huh.

21:58.350 --> 22:02.152
Excuse me. Hi, we're here for
some follow-up questions.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.321
Oh, ask Amy anything,
we're ready.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.090
Everyone says
she's the frontrunner.

22:07.092 --> 22:08.959
Oh, we've been winning these
since first grade.

22:08.961 --> 22:11.395
Mit and dartmouth have been
after us since middle school.

22:11.397 --> 22:13.597
Well, balance is also important.

22:13.599 --> 22:16.033
You make sure you have
hobbies and social life.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.836
Distractions, ma'am.
Distractions.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.338
My Amy is laser-focused
and we will not stop

22:21.340 --> 22:22.372
until we get what we want.

22:22.374 --> 22:24.208
What is that, that thing?

22:24.210 --> 22:27.010
This is the Jones-o-meter.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.847
It calculates based
on stem fair criteria

22:29.849 --> 22:32.015
using algorithms
and vertical compliance.

22:32.017 --> 22:37.187
It predicts the winner,
99% accuracy.

22:37.189 --> 22:40.390
Oh, well, please Jones us
as much as you want.

22:41.927 --> 22:43.060
Oh.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.262
Some people use the term
"tiger mom."

22:45.264 --> 22:47.231
I'm the Wolverine of mothers.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.232
( Growls )

22:49.401 --> 22:51.235
Oh, wow.
Nice.

22:51.237 --> 22:54.071
That's admirable.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.973
What about you, Amy?

22:55.975 --> 22:59.243
I'm totally ready to
kick butt and take names.

22:59.245 --> 23:00.944
Okay.

23:00.946 --> 23:01.945
Well, I think we've seen enough.

23:01.947 --> 23:03.513
Thank you.

23:03.515 --> 23:06.083
Oh, you saw enough the second
you laid eyes on our booth, huh?

23:06.085 --> 23:07.951
Yeah.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.887
They loved us.

23:11.290 --> 23:13.123
All right, show me the magic.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.625
What do you got?

23:14.627 --> 23:16.927
You got a wand,
a Jewel, a monkey's paw?

23:16.929 --> 23:18.362
You sure?

23:18.364 --> 23:20.430
I mean, Jenkins said
we need a powerful focus,

23:20.432 --> 23:22.332
that thing's barely registering.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.334
And who's the third?
Rule of three.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.937
Amy, her mom,
they want the same thing.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.405
Not so sure about that.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.506
Who's the third member
of the coven?

23:29.508 --> 23:32.175
( Rattling )

23:32.177 --> 23:33.644
What'd you do?

23:33.646 --> 23:36.079
I just hit this
page here, this app.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.482
A.L.B.

23:38.484 --> 23:41.184
It's a magic spell.

23:41.186 --> 23:43.387
Someone turned a
magic spell into an app.

23:46.525 --> 23:48.258
So, are you familiar
with the quote,

23:48.260 --> 23:50.093
"any sufficiently
advanced technology

23:50.095 --> 23:51.161
is indistinguishable
from magic?"

23:51.163 --> 23:52.663
Uh-hmm.

23:52.665 --> 23:55.499
It turns out, any
sufficiently disguised magic

23:55.501 --> 23:57.968
is indistinguishable
from technology.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.304
That is a wish
fulfillment spell.

24:00.306 --> 24:02.539
It's disguised as one of
those brain trainer things,

24:02.541 --> 24:04.474
the "advanced learning buddy."

24:04.476 --> 24:06.310
You know, list how many words
that rhyme with "mash"

24:06.312 --> 24:08.312
in under a minute, and your
IQ goes up 20 points.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.147
Mash, lash, dash,
rash, crash, slash.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.649
Right, distracts you with
the test, but each level,

24:12.651 --> 24:15.052
as you advance, it tells you
to focus on a goal,

24:15.054 --> 24:17.187
before kicking you up to
the next level.

24:17.189 --> 24:20.657
And the player has unknowingly
performed basic rituals

24:20.659 --> 24:24.328
embedded in the code, once
that is completed successfully

24:24.330 --> 24:26.396
is prompted to "wish."

24:26.398 --> 24:29.333
Structurally, it's witchcraft,

24:29.335 --> 24:32.369
without all the
"eye of newt" nonsense.

24:32.371 --> 24:35.272
How did a teenager create
something like this?

24:35.274 --> 24:37.307
No way Amy built this.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.009
I mean, if you look into
the code,

24:39.011 --> 24:41.745
even looking past
all the glowy bits,

24:41.747 --> 24:43.580
it's way more complex than
anything I've ever hacked,

24:43.582 --> 24:46.249
and I've hacked the NSA.

24:46.251 --> 24:48.151
Allegedly.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.688
The magic, too,
is powerful, even brutal.

24:51.690 --> 24:54.558
An expertise in the craft that I
have not seen in a very long time.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.593
And this is what's
hurting these kids.

24:56.595 --> 24:59.396
Certainly. I mean, you wish
that you defeat your opponent,

24:59.398 --> 25:02.032
even subconsciously,

25:02.034 --> 25:03.467
the spell is so powerful,

25:03.469 --> 25:06.103
it amplifies that wish
and makes it so.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.337
Cassandra was right.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.306
Amy's using this to get ahead

25:09.308 --> 25:10.407
but she has no idea
the blowback that's coming.

25:10.409 --> 25:12.209
No, she's not.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.044
Well, the harm will return
to her, Mr. Jones.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.480
No, what I mean is,
look at the usage data.

25:16.482 --> 25:18.648
I mean, this is a
powerful magic spell

25:18.650 --> 25:23.020
transformed into an app but
Amy has never, ever used it.

25:23.022 --> 25:28.125
So, the one person I can prove is
using magic is not using magic.

25:28.127 --> 25:32.029
Great. So who is?

25:49.381 --> 25:51.114
Excuse me.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.155
Dashell.

25:58.157 --> 26:01.291
No, but wait.
Please don't go.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.627
You're not librarians, are you?

26:03.629 --> 26:09.733
You saw Leonard's volcano.

26:09.735 --> 26:12.736
What happened to Tim,
everybody else,

26:12.738 --> 26:18.408
all of the weird sicknesses
and accidents?

26:18.410 --> 26:19.676
This is going to sound crazy,

26:19.678 --> 26:21.545
but you have an app
on your phone...

26:21.547 --> 26:23.380
I knew it.

26:23.382 --> 26:24.848
My mom gave it to me
but I didn't use it.

26:27.352 --> 26:28.418
Your mom made it?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.320
No, no.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.456
She got it off this
website for proactive parents.

26:32.458 --> 26:34.591
That's what they call
themselves, get together

26:34.593 --> 26:37.594
and talk about being
awesome parents.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.564
I opened it once
but it felt wrong,

26:40.566 --> 26:42.699
like, greasy in my head.

26:42.701 --> 26:44.701
Everyone else was using it,
and the more they used it,

26:44.703 --> 26:45.735
the more they focused.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.671
And the more they focused,

26:47.673 --> 26:49.339
the more their wishes came true.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.108
But you still didn't use it.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.642
Because my wishes weren't
about being smarter,

26:52.644 --> 26:55.312
they were about being normal.

26:55.314 --> 26:58.548
I mean, I didn't want to not
be smart, I just didn't...

26:58.550 --> 27:03.286
Want it to be the only
thing that you were.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.489
You wanted another adjective.

27:05.491 --> 27:09.659
You were one of us.

27:09.661 --> 27:13.463
I had a whole wall
full of trophies.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.565
So, were your parents the same?

27:15.567 --> 27:16.700
No dates.

27:16.702 --> 27:17.734
No movies.

27:17.736 --> 27:19.870
No social life.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.738
No hobbies that don't look good
on a college application, just...

27:21.740 --> 27:24.808
Working towards
the perfect future

27:24.810 --> 27:26.576
that they had in their minds.

27:26.578 --> 27:29.479
Yeah, pretty much.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.152
Did it get better?

27:38.223 --> 27:42.459
No.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.327
It just ended.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.730
I think they dreamed
that they had in their head

27:46.732 --> 27:49.733
was too big for me to carry.

27:49.735 --> 27:52.636
I think they loved it more.

28:03.248 --> 28:06.583
She gave me the website
for the app.

28:06.585 --> 28:07.751
How much did you hear?

28:07.753 --> 28:12.789
Hmm?
Didn't hear a thing.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.659
Whatever happened to
your wall full of trophies?

28:15.661 --> 28:18.728
When this went from
super-math to hallucinations,

28:18.730 --> 28:21.231
I dropped out of school.

28:21.233 --> 28:24.568
I came home one day, my parents had
just tossed all of my trophies.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.803
They thought they'd be
a painful reminder

28:26.805 --> 28:28.638
that I wasn't who I used to be.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.674
We should be finishing
the judging.

28:30.676 --> 28:32.642
Which room did we
put the trophies in?

28:32.644 --> 28:35.579
Why are you asking me?

28:35.581 --> 28:39.382
No, I'm dodging one
of the crazy mothers.

28:59.671 --> 29:03.240
Oh, my.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.544
I'm in through the main website.

29:07.546 --> 29:08.812
There are thousands
of downloads,

29:08.814 --> 29:11.648
but at this location
right now there are...

29:11.650 --> 29:13.717
27 active users.

29:13.719 --> 29:16.519
Three times three times three,
that's a rule of three thrice over.

29:16.521 --> 29:19.256
- ( Phone rings )
- So--

29:19.258 --> 29:21.625
- so, any backlash?
- Increases exponentially.

29:21.627 --> 29:23.893
( Phone rings )

29:23.895 --> 29:25.729
Jenkins?
We found something.

29:25.731 --> 29:28.665
There's some sort of accidental
super-coven--

29:28.667 --> 29:29.466
what, right now?

29:29.468 --> 29:31.801
Okay. Okay.

29:31.803 --> 29:33.536
Jenkins freaking
out about something.

29:33.538 --> 29:34.704
Okay. If all of those kids
are using

29:34.706 --> 29:36.606
that spell against each other,

29:36.608 --> 29:37.941
then a giant feedback loop is
building inside that stem fair.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.743
Okay, I'll handle Jenkins.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.678
You make sure these kids
don't turn this school

29:41.680 --> 29:43.280
into a smoking crater.

29:49.888 --> 29:51.688
Whoa.

29:51.690 --> 29:52.656
Yes.

29:54.393 --> 29:55.892
Hi, there.

29:55.894 --> 29:58.328
Oh, hi.
This is amazing.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.965
Is she meant to be here as
in the library recruited her?

30:01.967 --> 30:05.969
Assuredly not.

30:05.971 --> 30:09.606
I'm assuming we have one of
those memory-wiping doohickeys.

30:09.608 --> 30:10.640
You might want to get that.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.575
Colonel baird...

30:12.577 --> 30:13.743
Miss McCabe, I'm sure you must
be very confused right now.

30:13.745 --> 30:15.945
No, actually.

30:15.947 --> 30:19.549
You fell, you bumped your--
no, actually?

30:19.551 --> 30:21.651
No, actually.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.755
Everything just got
much, much clearer.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.097
Colonel baird.

30:34.099 --> 30:37.834
I would like you
to meet Morgan le fay.

30:47.979 --> 30:52.582
Lucinda McCabe is Morgan le fay.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.484
I know that name.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.486
And you're a librarian?

30:56.488 --> 30:57.754
I sort of know that name.

30:57.756 --> 30:59.622
Oh, guardian.
Sorry, I'll talk slower.

30:59.624 --> 31:01.524
Hey.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.726
Sister of king Arthur,

31:02.728 --> 31:05.695
responsible for
the downfall of Camelot.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.930
Oh, come now.

31:06.932 --> 31:10.834
We both know that's
not true, galeas.

31:10.836 --> 31:12.001
The most powerful witch
on the planet

31:12.003 --> 31:14.904
raised an army
and killed Arthur.

31:14.906 --> 31:16.706
No, I prefer sorceress.

31:16.708 --> 31:20.076
"Witch" has too much
gender baggage.

31:20.078 --> 31:22.912
Oh, you found one.

31:22.914 --> 31:24.013
It's lovely, isn't it?

31:24.015 --> 31:26.850
A word to the wise,
I'd stay in here

31:26.852 --> 31:28.618
for the next few minutes
if I were you.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.588
It's all about to begin,
the feedback loop.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.524
All this magic flying around,

31:34.526 --> 31:35.992
the rule of three

31:35.994 --> 31:39.729
coming to punish all those
naughty little boys and girls.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.598
Now, if you'll excuse me.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.932
Colonel, shoot her.

31:42.934 --> 31:43.733
don't tell me who
to shoot, Jenkins.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.635
Thank you, guardian.

31:45.637 --> 31:47.170
Oh, I will shoot you,
but not because he says so.

31:47.172 --> 31:48.972
What happens to those kids
when the backlash begins?

31:48.974 --> 31:50.106
She is one of the most
evil creatures...

31:50.108 --> 31:51.574
Hold your tongue.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.542
( Gags )

32:04.089 --> 32:06.156
Please. If shooting me
was an option,

32:06.158 --> 32:09.125
how do you think I would've
survived the 19th century?

32:09.127 --> 32:12.462
When Tennyson became popular,
it was a nightmare.

32:14.132 --> 32:17.000
She has left a trail of
blood a thousand years long.

32:17.002 --> 32:20.603
Go, get her whatever the cost.

32:20.605 --> 32:21.604
( Chokes )

32:27.212 --> 32:29.446
Morgan le fay, she's the one
who built the app.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.714
Actually, Ukrainian
programmers built the app;

32:31.716 --> 32:33.116
I just built the wish spell.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.984
You hurt kids.
That's awful.

32:34.986 --> 32:37.020
I never hurt anyone, darling.

32:37.022 --> 32:38.822
That's the scam.

32:38.824 --> 32:40.757
You put magic in the hands
of mortals, and they will,

32:40.759 --> 32:42.725
inevitably, destroy each other.

32:42.727 --> 32:44.861
I just sit back and wait
for the rule of three

32:44.863 --> 32:46.763
to kick out its backlash.

32:46.765 --> 32:48.965
So you're doing it
for a cheap thrill then?

32:48.967 --> 32:50.800
Please.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.870
All that magic floating around,
all that destruction,

32:53.872 --> 32:55.772
I just skim off the top,

32:55.774 --> 32:58.608
recharge my powers, stay young.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.049
Whoa.

33:06.051 --> 33:08.084
She could be
anywhere in history.

33:08.086 --> 33:10.753
No. She's still here
because she's not done yet.

33:10.755 --> 33:12.822
I'll go north, you go south.

33:12.824 --> 33:16.993
All right, pull the fire alarm,
evacuate everyone.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.496
No, those 27 kids,
they're linked by magic.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.231
The rule of three
can find them anywhere.

33:21.233 --> 33:23.733
So, we got to protect
them from here.

33:23.735 --> 33:26.069
A Faraday cage.

33:26.071 --> 33:28.938
It's like a container that
energy can't get into or out of.

33:28.940 --> 33:31.841
Right, protects everything inside
from an electrical charge.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.977
We don't have time to construct
something like that.

33:33.979 --> 33:36.546
Somebody already did.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.985
Hey, hey.
What are you doing?

33:41.987 --> 33:43.887
Are you crazy?

33:43.889 --> 33:46.222
You were assigned this booth,
this table, weren't you?

33:46.224 --> 33:47.223
Yeah, we're all
assigned our booths

33:47.225 --> 33:48.725
by the McCabe foundation.

33:48.727 --> 33:49.792
Why--

33:49.794 --> 33:51.294
okay. Stone, look at this.

33:51.296 --> 33:54.797
Five legs on a round table,
it's a pentagram.

33:54.799 --> 33:57.000
Le fay wanted to keep
Amy in the fair.

33:57.002 --> 33:59.302
The longer you're in, the more
hostility be thrown at you.

33:59.304 --> 34:01.671
More backlash, better harvest.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.006
Okay. So, we need to take
the legs off the table,

34:03.008 --> 34:04.807
spread them out,

34:04.809 --> 34:06.042
and then get everyone
inside the pentagram.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.744
And you think that'll work?

34:07.746 --> 34:09.178
It will if we supercharge it.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.781
The app, it's a focusing spell.

34:11.783 --> 34:14.984
So, if we plant the stakes
and then use it

34:14.985 --> 34:17.887
to focus all of our energy
on creating the Faraday cage,

34:17.889 --> 34:20.790
protecting the kids.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.891
Do you think you
can map out the pentagram?

34:22.893 --> 34:24.694
I was a surveyor for 10 years,

34:24.696 --> 34:26.295
I can estimate distance
like a tachymeter.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.097
- Just do it.
- I'll find Jones.

34:28.099 --> 34:29.933
Get some more phones.

34:29.935 --> 34:33.002
Five legs but
there's only four of us.

34:33.004 --> 34:34.337
No, five.
You have me.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.272
No, they most certainly
do not have you.

34:36.274 --> 34:38.341
You never used the app for bad.

34:38.342 --> 34:39.876
Look, I don't know
what's going on here,

34:39.878 --> 34:40.944
but you are trying to
make us lose this...

34:40.946 --> 34:43.279
Mom, stop. Stop.

34:43.281 --> 34:45.748
It's me.
Not us.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.750
It's my life.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.188
Magic's real?

34:52.190 --> 34:54.190
Magic's real.

34:54.192 --> 34:56.893
Awesome.

34:56.895 --> 34:58.194
Okay, let's break this table.

34:58.196 --> 35:01.097
Hi, there.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.165
I'm a very important judge.

35:02.167 --> 35:03.900
Impress me.

35:03.902 --> 35:06.970
Oh.
Oh, okay.

35:06.972 --> 35:09.372
The sea otter is generally
considered adorable,

35:09.374 --> 35:11.975
but it is in fact
history's greatest monster.

35:11.977 --> 35:13.710
And if we don't take
action immediately,

35:13.712 --> 35:16.946
they will take over
the planet and destroy us all.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.915
Sorry, what?

35:31.396 --> 35:34.230
This stops right now.

35:34.232 --> 35:39.268
I've always wondered whether guardians were
envious of or annoyed by the librarians.

35:39.270 --> 35:41.204
What are you going to do?

35:41.206 --> 35:42.972
We've already established
you can't shoot me.

35:45.110 --> 35:47.076
How did you touch me?

35:47.078 --> 35:49.112
There's no magic in
the world stronger...

35:49.114 --> 35:50.780
Except your magic.

35:50.782 --> 35:52.982
Your advanced learning
buddy helped me visualize

35:52.984 --> 35:56.886
something I wished for,
an even playing field.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.988
Ow.

35:58.990 --> 35:59.989
( Thunder rumbles )

35:59.991 --> 36:02.191
( Cackles )

36:02.193 --> 36:03.426
You've got about five seconds to
stop what's going on out there.

36:03.428 --> 36:05.395
Tick tock.

36:13.238 --> 36:14.237
Stop the tricks.

36:14.239 --> 36:16.139
I'm not doing it.

36:16.141 --> 36:19.175
This is blowback for all their
evil deeds coming for them,

36:19.177 --> 36:23.212
multiplied by three
by three by three.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.183
I couldn't stop it
if I wanted to.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.285
Looks like you have
a choice, guardian.

36:29.287 --> 36:32.155
Either you kill me
or you save the kids.

36:32.157 --> 36:34.791
No time for both.

36:36.061 --> 36:38.461
I do believe you have a chance.

36:38.463 --> 36:41.164
It's the first time
I've hurt in centuries.

36:41.166 --> 36:42.865
( Thunder )

36:44.969 --> 36:50.006
But you still have to make a
choice, kill me or save them.

36:52.243 --> 36:53.843
This isn't over.

36:59.084 --> 37:01.084
Promises, promises.

37:06.357 --> 37:07.390
All right, it's marked.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.825
The final x is on the stage.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.493
They're not all
inside the pentagram.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.895
If they're not in the
middle, it won't work.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.932
Attention, everyone.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.067
I'm Amy meyer, and the
electrical disturbances

37:18.069 --> 37:19.902
you're seeing are just a
side effect of

37:19.904 --> 37:22.805
my last minute project, a
five-sided Tesla coil field.

37:22.807 --> 37:26.275
One hundred thousand volts will
soon pulse through this room.

37:26.277 --> 37:29.378
Now, there is a downside
to my awesome experiment.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.481
If you're not all in the center of
the room, you may be electrocuted.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.082
Sorry.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.317
No way.
That's impossible.

37:34.319 --> 37:36.119
I'm Amy meyer.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.321
I've won every ribbon,
every medal, every trophy

37:38.323 --> 37:40.189
that you've wanted since
we were five years old.

37:40.191 --> 37:42.458
Do you really think
I'm bluffing?

37:42.460 --> 37:44.861
So, center of the room, right.

37:46.498 --> 37:50.199
All right. Center of the room,
in the middle.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.168
Hey, good job, kid.

37:52.170 --> 37:53.970
Go to your spot.

37:55.039 --> 37:55.972
Go.

38:53.298 --> 38:56.199
( Creaking )

38:56.201 --> 38:58.000
( Pants )

39:03.508 --> 39:06.075
Wow.

39:06.077 --> 39:10.246
More power than forever.

39:10.248 --> 39:11.414
Where is everyone?

39:11.416 --> 39:13.449
don't worry, you did it.

39:13.451 --> 39:16.252
You saved them all.

39:16.254 --> 39:20.089
They're out there
somewhere in the world.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.357
And where are we?

39:21.359 --> 39:23.860
We're stuck between the seconds,

39:23.862 --> 39:27.029
between the tick and the tock.

39:29.467 --> 39:31.467
So, let's finish this then.

39:31.469 --> 39:34.203
Guardian, on your best day,

39:34.205 --> 39:36.939
you might be able
to muss up my hair.

39:36.941 --> 39:39.475
And you already
had your best day.

39:41.246 --> 39:42.879
( Sizzling )

39:44.349 --> 39:46.182
So now what?

39:46.184 --> 39:49.485
You bring magic back
to the world, rule it?

39:49.487 --> 39:52.255
Bring magic back?

39:52.257 --> 39:54.090
Oh, my.

39:54.092 --> 39:57.293
No.

39:57.295 --> 40:01.364
Thanks to you, I finally
have enough power

40:01.366 --> 40:02.899
to hide.

40:02.901 --> 40:06.502
You did all this
so you could hide?

40:06.504 --> 40:10.506
Maybe even open a door
to the fae or the mirrorlands,

40:10.508 --> 40:14.377
anywhere but this doomed
little world when it happens.

40:14.379 --> 40:16.545
- When what happens?
- You'll understand.

40:16.547 --> 40:19.015
You've already been woven
into the loom of fate.

40:23.454 --> 40:26.455
Noli timere malum,

40:26.457 --> 40:29.558
sed time heroa.

40:31.963 --> 40:34.530
Tell that to, what
did he call himself?

40:34.532 --> 40:37.199
Jenkins?

40:37.201 --> 40:38.668
He'll understand.

41:09.233 --> 41:12.735
With the disqualification
of Amy meyer's project

41:12.737 --> 41:15.504
for its flagrant
disregard of the safety

41:15.506 --> 41:18.474
of her fellow students
and bystanders,

41:18.476 --> 41:20.676
and Lucinda McCabe,

41:20.678 --> 41:22.278
according to this note,

41:22.280 --> 41:25.381
taken away to the hospital
for her injuries,

41:25.383 --> 41:28.617
we will award the winner of
the fair based on the decision

41:28.619 --> 41:33.422
of our remaining judges,
the county librarians.

41:33.424 --> 41:38.361
The winner of the 6th annual
chicagoland stem fair is...

41:42.300 --> 41:44.533
Leonard Cole.

41:44.535 --> 41:46.035
Yes.

41:59.517 --> 42:00.483
Where's that trophy?

42:00.485 --> 42:02.184
Yes.

42:03.788 --> 42:05.521
Oi.

42:05.523 --> 42:06.722
Hey.

42:06.724 --> 42:08.657
Good job with the pentagram.

42:08.659 --> 42:12.328
That was easy, maybe too easy.

42:12.330 --> 42:15.131
Well, that was science
project of the day

42:15.133 --> 42:17.033
and you saved everybody's lives,

42:17.035 --> 42:19.368
so I think that deserves...

42:22.306 --> 42:24.073
Wow.

42:24.075 --> 42:27.076
First place in?

42:27.078 --> 42:28.611
In the category of mathemagics.

42:28.613 --> 42:31.447
Mathemagics.

42:31.449 --> 42:34.050
I like it.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.085
You stole this, didn't you?

42:36.087 --> 42:39.155
Yeah, I stole it,

42:39.157 --> 42:42.691
but you won it, without a doubt.

42:42.693 --> 42:45.161
So, focus on that.

42:49.767 --> 42:54.603
That was a mistake.

42:54.605 --> 42:56.505
We saved a hundred lives.

42:56.507 --> 42:58.107
And doomed her
next thousand victims.

42:58.109 --> 43:02.178
You had her.

43:02.180 --> 43:04.713
For the first time in centuries,

43:04.715 --> 43:06.749
she was caught off-guard.

43:06.751 --> 43:09.718
I'm a guardian.
I'm not a hired gun.

43:09.720 --> 43:11.587
I'm not here just to kill.

43:11.589 --> 43:16.559
And if she's so terrible,
why are the two of you so cozy?

43:16.561 --> 43:20.463
We've both lived a long time.

43:20.465 --> 43:22.531
Paths crossed.

43:22.533 --> 43:26.435
My experience, you don't hate
strangers quite that much.

43:29.307 --> 43:31.607
She said the end of
the world is coming.

43:31.609 --> 43:34.777
Well, Morgan has many vices,
but she never, ever lies.

43:34.779 --> 43:38.547
She also had a little
love note for you.

43:38.549 --> 43:42.751
Noli timere malum,
sed time heroa.

43:42.753 --> 43:46.155
What does that mean?

43:46.157 --> 43:50.893
"Do not fear the villain,
fear the hero."

43:50.895 --> 43:55.231
The end-- an end,
is coming, colonel.

43:55.233 --> 43:58.167
And trust me, if you do not
learn how to fight the war

43:58.169 --> 44:01.704
instead of just
winning the battles,

44:01.706 --> 44:03.506
none of us will survive.
