WEBVTT

00:02.133 --> 00:05.736
(thunder rumbling)

00:05.736 --> 00:07.578
(Callie) I AM TELLING YOU, ONCE
WE GOT THESE DOCTORS TALKING,

00:07.578 --> 00:09.040
IT WAS A HORROR SHOW.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.742
SHH. I JUST GOT
SOFIA BACK DOWN.

00:11.742 --> 00:15.786
(lowered voice) OH, AND, UH,
PORTLAND GEN HAS QUOTAS NOW.

00:15.786 --> 00:18.049
YEAH. IT'S UNSPOKEN,
BUT IT'S UNDERSTOOD

00:18.049 --> 00:20.321
THAT YOU HAVE TO CHURN OUT
A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PROCEDURES.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.492
AND NO RESEARCH?

00:21.492 --> 00:22.793
NOPE.
PEGASUS IS ONLY INTERESTED

00:22.793 --> 00:24.295
IN HIGH-VOLUME,
HIGH-PRICE-TAG PROCEDURES.

00:24.295 --> 00:25.756
BARELY
ANY PATIENT INTERACTION.

00:25.756 --> 00:27.798
SO NO RESEARCH, NO INNOVATION,

00:27.798 --> 00:31.031
NO OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT IT IS
WE GOT INTO MEDICINE TO DO.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.533
WELL, WE WON'T LET THAT
HAPPEN TO US HERE.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.235
OH, YEAH? THAT'S WHAT
THEY SAID AT FIRST.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.607
AND THEN THE PEOPLE THAT
FOUGHT MANAGEMENT GOT FIRED,

00:36.607 --> 00:39.039
AND THE REST WORE DOWN
OR THEY LEFT.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.741
(Meredith) THEY SAY
THERE'S ONE SURE SIGN

00:40.741 --> 00:42.813
OF A SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATION.

00:42.813 --> 00:44.745
NOW I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.
NONE OF US DO.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.577
YOU GUYS, COME ON.
WE HAVE TO DO THIS.

00:46.577 --> 00:48.319
WE HAVE TO BUY THE HOSPITAL.

00:48.319 --> 00:49.550
WHOA. HOLD ON.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.821
MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT.
JUST WAIT.

00:50.821 --> 00:53.224
IT'S THAT WHEN THE PARTIES
LEAVE THE TABLE...

00:53.224 --> 00:54.625
WHAT IF WE DON'T WANT TO?

00:54.625 --> 00:57.057
THEY BOTH FEEL LIKE
THEY'VE BEEN SCREWED.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.389
YES. AH, YES.

00:58.389 --> 01:00.131
IS IT--IS IT THIS?

01:00.131 --> 01:02.062
OR... OR THAT?

01:02.062 --> 01:04.135
OH, THAT.
OH, EXACTLY THAT.

01:04.135 --> 01:05.296
(laughs)

01:05.296 --> 01:06.597
THE GOAL IS A COMPROMISE...

01:06.597 --> 01:08.068
MM.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.101
OKAY.

01:12.143 --> 01:13.304
YOUR TURN.

01:13.304 --> 01:16.107
A SITUATION
WHERE EVERYBODY WINS.

01:16.107 --> 01:17.578
(dings)

01:17.578 --> 01:19.550
(Arizona) I'M SORRY. IT'S NEVER
BEEN MY DREAM TO RUN A HOSPITAL.

01:19.550 --> 01:21.512
OKAY, WELL, YOU MIGHT NOT
HAVE TO RUN IT.
CRISTINA SHOULD BE HERE.

01:21.512 --> 01:22.683
I HAVE BEEN TEXTING HER.

01:22.683 --> 01:23.854
(Arizona)
I JUST GOT BACK TO WORK.

01:23.854 --> 01:25.186
AND, DEREK,
YOU JUST GOT YOUR HAND BACK.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.357
DON'T YOU WANT TO JUST WORK?

01:26.357 --> 01:27.518
WORK WHERE?

01:27.518 --> 01:28.689
I DON'T WANT SOMEBODY
TELLING ME

01:28.689 --> 01:29.790
WHICH PATIENTS I CAN
AND CAN'T TREAT.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.162
(Meredith)
OR PUTTING A STOPWATCH

01:31.162 --> 01:32.323
ON HOW MUCH TIME
YOU CAN SPEND WITH THEM.

01:32.323 --> 01:33.724
YEAH, IF WE RAN THE PLACE,

01:33.724 --> 01:35.866
WE COULD MAKE POLICY DECISIONS
BASED ON EXPERIENCE. DO Y--

01:35.866 --> 01:37.798
UH, NO OFFENSE, BUT THAT IS
A NAIVE WAY OF PUTTING IT.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.400
THE JOB IS MUCH HARDER
THAN YOU THINK.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.801
I WANTED IT ONCE,
AND I HATED IT.

01:40.801 --> 01:41.872
WE SHOULD STAY THE COURSE.

01:41.872 --> 01:43.574
I MADE A DEAL WITH PEGASUS

01:43.574 --> 01:44.875
THAT APPARENTLY WILL HELP
THE SALE.

01:44.875 --> 01:45.836
WHAT... DEAL?

01:45.836 --> 01:47.178
NOTHING, IT'S STUPID.

01:47.178 --> 01:48.839
BUT MAYBE THAT'S
HOW WE MAKE IT WORK,

01:48.839 --> 01:50.781
FROM THE INSIDE.
(Arizona) WHAT ABOUT HUNT?

01:50.781 --> 01:52.313
I MEAN, HE'S PUSHING
FOR THE PEGASUS SALE.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.644
HE THINKS
IT'S A GOOD DEAL.

01:53.644 --> 01:54.885
SO WHAT'S HE GONNA SAY?

01:54.885 --> 01:55.846
(cell phone rings and buzzes)

01:55.846 --> 01:57.218
(groans)
(thunder rumbling)

01:57.218 --> 01:58.689
OH, IT'S CAHILL.

01:58.689 --> 02:00.851
YOU KNOW, SHE JUST WANTS
TO STRATEGIZE.

02:00.851 --> 02:02.723
AT 3:00 A.M.?

02:02.723 --> 02:04.795
(scoffs) I BET SHE DOES.

02:04.795 --> 02:06.126
YOU KNOW THE NURSES
ARE THREATENING A WALKOUT,

02:06.126 --> 02:08.128
AND I HAVE TO TALK THEM DOWN?

02:08.128 --> 02:09.230
YOU KNOW WHAT? NO.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.431
LET'S JUST NOT
TALK ABOUT THIS.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.204
I JUST WANT TO BE HERE
FOR A FEW HOURS WITH YOU

02:13.204 --> 02:15.706
WHERE THERE ARE
NO PROBLEMS.
OKAY.

02:15.706 --> 02:17.568
YOU KNOW, THE SALE TO PEGASUS
CLOSES IN THREE DAYS.

02:17.568 --> 02:19.910
AND CAHILL SAYS THE BUYERS
ARE GETTING TWITCHY,

02:19.910 --> 02:21.772
AND IF THERE IS A MASS EXODUS
OF THE STAFF--

02:21.772 --> 02:23.143
EVEN IF THERE'S
A TINY EXODUS--

02:23.143 --> 02:24.645
I MEAN,
BASICALLY IF ANYBODY LEAVES,

02:24.645 --> 02:26.577
THEN THE BUYERS
ARE GONNA BACK OUT,

02:26.577 --> 02:27.878
AND WE LOSE THE SALE,
AND...

02:27.878 --> 02:29.250
(snaps fingers)

02:29.250 --> 02:31.382
THE HOSPITAL CLOSES.

02:33.384 --> 02:35.186
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

02:35.186 --> 02:36.687
YOU SURE?

02:36.687 --> 02:37.828
(thunder rumbling)

02:37.828 --> 02:39.190
MAYBE?

02:39.190 --> 02:40.531
YOU CAN BE A LITTLE MORE...
MAYBE?

02:40.531 --> 02:41.862
CONVINCING.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.234
OKAY.
(laughing)

02:43.234 --> 02:45.736
(deepens voice)
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:45.736 --> 02:46.867
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT, LIKE
$100 MILLION, $200 MILLION?

02:46.867 --> 02:48.639
(Derek) YOU KNOW WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:48.639 --> 02:50.871
WE HAVE MORE THAN WE'RE EVER
GONNA BE ABLE TO SPEND ANYWAY.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.743
WE HAVE MORE THAN
WE'LL EVER BE--

02:52.743 --> 02:53.874
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.246
(Arizona) BUT I DON'T KNOW.

02:55.246 --> 02:56.407
THIS IS A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING.

02:56.407 --> 02:57.908
NOBODY KNOWS
WHAT IT'S GONNA COST.

02:57.908 --> 02:59.250
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

02:59.250 --> 03:00.911
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
THEY TAKE EVERYTHING?

03:00.911 --> 03:03.654
I MEAN, EVERYTHING FROM
THE LAWSUIT, FROM ALL OF US?

03:03.654 --> 03:05.886
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S GONNA
COST TO BUY SEATTLE GRACE,

03:05.886 --> 03:07.418
BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU

03:07.418 --> 03:08.619
IT'S MORE THAN
THE FOUR OF US HAVE COMBINED.
I--

03:08.619 --> 03:09.820
THAT'S ONLY $60 MILLION.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.422
I HAD SOME MONEY
BEFORE ALL THIS.

03:11.422 --> 03:12.763
I'VE GOT ABOUT...

03:12.763 --> 03:14.425
700 GRAND I CAN GET TO
RIGHT AWAY.

03:14.425 --> 03:16.667
IT'S TRUE. WE HAVE MONEY IN
THE I.R.A. AND WE HAVE ABOUT--

03:16.667 --> 03:17.828
NO, LET'S NOT GET
AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

03:17.828 --> 03:19.470
WELL,
JUST THE LAWSUIT DAMAGES THEN.

03:19.470 --> 03:20.931
AND, UH,
WE'VE GOT MARK'S SHARE, TOO.

03:20.931 --> 03:22.303
MARK'S SHARE?

03:22.303 --> 03:24.305
YEAH, AND LEXIE'S MAYBE?
IS THAT RUDE OF ME--

03:24.305 --> 03:25.806
I MEAN, I WOULD HAVE TO ASK
HER F--OUR--OUR FATHER--

03:25.806 --> 03:27.838
DON'T WORRY. EXCUSE ME.
YES, THIS IS RUDE OF YOU.

03:27.838 --> 03:29.480
OKAY, I'M SORRY, BUT WE CAN'T
WASTE TIME ON POLITENESS HERE.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.642
AND MARK'S SHARE IS NOT
OUR MONEY. IT'S SOFIA'S.

03:31.642 --> 03:33.784
YOU SHOULD'VE TALKED
ABOUT THIS WITH ME--
UM, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

03:33.784 --> 03:35.716
I MEAN PRIVATELY
WITH YOUR WIFE.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.718
(thunder rumbling)

03:37.718 --> 03:38.919
WHERE IS CRISTINA?

03:38.919 --> 03:40.491
I DON'T KNOW.
I KEEP TEXTING HER.

03:40.491 --> 03:42.723
SHE WOULD SAY YES
TO THIS.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.395
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
(Callie and Derek) SHE KNOWS.

03:44.395 --> 03:45.556
(dings)
(Cristina and Owen groan)

03:45.556 --> 03:47.898
LEAVE US ALONE.

03:49.930 --> 03:50.961
(exhales)

03:50.961 --> 03:52.803
OH, GET SOME SLEEP.

03:52.803 --> 03:54.965
THIS ISN'T
ALL ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

03:54.965 --> 03:56.537
IT SHOULDN'T BE.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.808
(scoffs) IT IS RIGHT NOW.

03:57.808 --> 03:59.570
IF I CAN'T, YOU KNOW,
IF I CAN'T TALK THE NURSES

03:59.570 --> 04:01.772
INTO STAYING--

04:01.772 --> 04:04.845
YOU WILL.

04:04.845 --> 04:07.448
(sighs) I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,

04:07.448 --> 04:08.949
WITH OR WITHOUT PEGASUS.

04:08.949 --> 04:12.283
I KEEP RUNNING THROUGH
THE WORST-CASE SCENARIOS AND...

04:12.283 --> 04:14.455
(thunderclap)

04:14.455 --> 04:16.727
ALL I KNOW IS...

04:16.727 --> 04:19.460
THAT I'M HAPPY HERE
WITH YOU.

04:19.460 --> 04:22.533
WHATEVER'S FALLING APART,
I JUST...

04:22.533 --> 04:24.695
YOU AND I, WE'RE...

04:24.695 --> 04:26.437
WE'RE SAFE.

04:26.437 --> 04:28.569
RIGHT. RIGHT?

04:28.569 --> 04:29.740
(laughs)

04:29.740 --> 04:31.041
EXACTLY RIGHT.

04:33.704 --> 04:36.347
I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S RIGHT
TO SPEND ALL OF OUR MONEY.

04:36.347 --> 04:37.678
IT IS AN INVESTMENT.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.279
OF ALL OF OUR MONEY,
CALLIE.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.352
IF YOUR PARENTS HAD EVER
MADE YOU HAVE A SUMMER JOB...

04:41.352 --> 04:42.913
OH, COME ON.
THAT IS SO UNFAIR.
YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND.

04:42.913 --> 04:44.054
NO, YOU ARE READY
TO BANKRUPT US.

04:44.054 --> 04:45.416
YOU'RE READY TO LET
PEGASUS HORIZONS

04:45.416 --> 04:46.587
TURN US
INTO A BUNCH OF ROBOTS.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.619
YOU ARE READY TO SINK
$50 MILLION

04:48.619 --> 04:50.060
INTO MAINTAINING A GOOD VIBE.

04:50.060 --> 04:52.893
SO WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE,
WE LEAVE?

04:52.893 --> 04:54.625
NO, I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.827
THIS HOSPITAL IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT WE LUCKED INTO.

04:56.827 --> 04:58.569
THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT WE MADE.

04:58.569 --> 05:01.071
AND WEBBER HIRED US,
AND HE SET A TONE.

05:01.071 --> 05:02.603
HUNT SETS A TONE,

05:02.603 --> 05:03.934
AND IT'S SOMETHING
I AM PROUD TO BE A PART OF,

05:03.934 --> 05:06.977
AND IT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR.
(baby crying)

05:06.977 --> 05:08.909
SHOOT. SORRY.
IS THAT MINE OR YOURS?

05:08.909 --> 05:10.981
IT'S MINE,
BUT SHE'S GONNA WAKE YOURS.

05:10.981 --> 05:12.683
(Derek)
I THINK CALLIE'S RIGHT.

05:12.683 --> 05:14.785
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
A FINANCIAL INVESTMENT.

05:14.785 --> 05:16.316
IT'S A MUCH BIGGER
OPPORTUNITY...
RIGHT.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.048
TO STAY AND MAKE THE PLACE
WE DREAMED OF WORK AGAIN.

05:18.048 --> 05:19.820
YES.
OH, GOD.
WILL YOU TWO STOP IT?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.822
WE ARE NOT SPENDING
THIS MONEY.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.824
IF I HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING
IN THE PAST YEAR,

05:23.824 --> 05:26.056
IT'S THAT WE DON'T GET TO KNOW
WHAT'S COMING AROUND THE CORNER.

05:26.056 --> 05:30.060
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN,
TO YOU, TO ME. ANYTHING.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.432
AND OUR DAUGHTER DESERVES

05:31.432 --> 05:32.963
AS MUCH PROTECTION
AS WE CAN GIVE HER.

05:32.963 --> 05:35.005
AND WE HAVE THE CHANCE
TO NOT HAVE TO WORRY

05:35.005 --> 05:36.537
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

05:36.537 --> 05:39.069
A CHANCE TO BE PREPARED
SHOULD THE WORST HAPPEN--

05:39.069 --> 05:41.341
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
LIKE THAT... (scoffs)

05:41.341 --> 05:43.874
GETTING READY FOR DISASTERS
THAT MAY NEVER HAPPEN.

05:43.874 --> 05:44.845
WELL, WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
RIGHT NOW

05:44.845 --> 05:46.116
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

05:46.116 --> 05:47.548
AND MAYBE WE HAVE
A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT--

05:47.548 --> 05:48.719
OH, DON'T TRY
AND MAKE ME FEEL SELFISH.

05:48.719 --> 05:49.880
DON'T TRY AND MAKE ME
FEEL GUILTY

05:49.880 --> 05:50.951
JUST BECAUSE YOU DO.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.122
WHO SAID I FELT GUILTY?

05:52.122 --> 05:53.484
I THINK--I THINK
YOU FEEL, UH, GUILTY.

05:53.484 --> 05:54.655
BUT THAT'S NOT--IT'S NOT--

05:54.655 --> 05:56.787
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
LET'S--GO AHEAD.

05:56.787 --> 05:57.958
TELL ME.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.460
(thunder rumbles)
MM.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.691
(rainfall)

06:00.691 --> 06:01.862
SOME OF US DIED.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.694
AND SOME OF US ARE GONNA
LIVE WITH CHALLENGES

06:03.694 --> 06:05.666
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.798
AND YOU--
YOU GOT THE MONEY.

06:07.798 --> 06:08.939
AND THEN YOU GOT
YOUR HAND BACK

06:08.939 --> 06:10.471
AND YOU GOT YOUR CAREER BACK,

06:10.471 --> 06:12.403
AND I THINK
THAT YOU FEEL GUILTY.

06:12.403 --> 06:14.875
I THINK YOU FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT YOUR DECISION TO SUE

06:14.875 --> 06:16.006
AND I-I THINK
THAT YOU FEEL GUILTY

06:16.006 --> 06:17.408
ABOUT HAVING ALL THIS MONEY.

06:17.408 --> 06:18.709
AND NOW I THINK THAT YOU WANT
TO BE THE ONE

06:18.709 --> 06:19.880
THAT COMES IN
AND SAVES EVERYONE,

06:19.880 --> 06:20.981
AND YOU HAVE TO BE
THE HERO.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.152
AND IT'S SELFISH
AND IT'S EGOMANIACAL,

06:22.152 --> 06:23.684
AND NOW IT'S AFFECTING
MY FAMILY.

06:23.684 --> 06:24.915
SO JUST STOP. OKAY?

06:24.915 --> 06:26.156
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE
TO MAKE IT BETTER

06:26.156 --> 06:27.688
HAS ACTUALLY MADE IT WORSE.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.620
SO PLEASE STOP.

06:29.620 --> 06:32.993
(rainfall continues)

06:32.993 --> 06:34.825
I THINK WE SHOULD GO.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.929
YOU SHOULD.

06:40.701 --> 06:43.804
(sighs)

06:43.804 --> 06:53.884
(thunder rumbling)

06:53.884 --> 06:56.146
(rainfall continues)

07:00.991 --> 07:02.523
HEY, DEREK.
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.694
OH, NO. THERE'S NO NEED.

07:03.694 --> 07:04.895
NO, NO, I DO.

07:04.895 --> 07:06.426
IT WAS LATE, AND I WAS TIRED
AND STRESSED OUT.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.598
WELL, WE WERE ALL
STRESSED OUT.

07:07.598 --> 07:08.959
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO DO OUR BEST.

07:08.959 --> 07:10.430
NO, I KNOW, BUT I HAD NO RIGHT
TO CALL YOU EGOTISTICAL.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.762
IT WAS "EGOMANIACAL,"
I THINK.

07:11.762 --> 07:14.465
YEAH. (sighs)
I WAS OUT OF LINE.

07:14.465 --> 07:16.066
(elevator bell dings)

07:16.066 --> 07:18.108
ON THE OTHER HAND...

07:18.108 --> 07:20.040
(people speaking indistinctly,
telephone ringing)

07:20.040 --> 07:22.973
YOU'RE PEGASUS'
"FACE OF THE HOSPITAL"?

07:22.973 --> 07:24.915
CAHILL SAID IT WOULD BE
SOME BROCHURES,

07:24.915 --> 07:26.617
SOME SCHMOOZING, NOT...

07:26.617 --> 07:28.178
ALL OF THIS.

07:28.178 --> 07:30.080
NOT A WHOLE LOT OF
PRACTICING MEDICINE EITHER.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.982
I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR.

07:31.982 --> 07:33.153
(ding)

07:33.153 --> 07:34.625
NO OFFENSE, DEREK.

07:34.625 --> 07:35.956
I MEAN, IT'S A GREAT FACE,
BUT...

07:35.956 --> 07:38.559
THIS IS A LOT OF IT.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.460
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

07:40.460 --> 07:42.593
(Meredith) I MEAN,
THIS IS KIND OF GROSS.

07:42.593 --> 07:43.934
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.

07:43.934 --> 07:45.235
(Shane)
DR. SHEPHERD, HOLD UP!
(clicking buttons)

07:45.235 --> 07:46.597
YEAH?

07:46.597 --> 07:47.798
LOVE THE PICTURE.

07:47.798 --> 07:49.940
LOVE IT.
YOUR HEAD IS GIGANTIC.

07:49.940 --> 07:51.241
I'M PREPPING FOR OUR A.V.M.

07:51.241 --> 07:53.073
DO YOU PREFER
O.R. TWO OR FOUR?

07:53.073 --> 07:55.045
HE'S DOING AN A.V.M.
UNDER HYPOTHERMIC ARREST

07:55.045 --> 07:56.476
WHERE HE DROPS
THE BRAIN'S TEMPERATURE

07:56.476 --> 07:57.948
TO AVOID STROKE RISK.
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

07:57.948 --> 07:59.850
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
IN THE REGION WHO DOES IT.
I KNOW.

07:59.850 --> 08:01.251
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO SEE IT UP CLOSE.
CAN WE GO NOW?

08:01.251 --> 08:03.113
I'M NOT DOING IT. CAHILL
WANTS ME TO MEET THE BUYERS.

08:03.113 --> 08:04.985
HE'S THE NEW FACE
OF THE HOSPITAL NOW.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.687
AND THE HAIR. LUCKY US.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.259
GREAT.
JUST MAKE IT GO AWAY.

08:09.259 --> 08:10.821
(clicks button)

08:10.821 --> 08:11.992
(gasps) OH.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.223
OH, MY GOD.

08:13.223 --> 08:15.095
CAN WE TALK ABOUT
THE GIANT PICTURES OF MYSELF?

08:15.095 --> 08:16.066
DO YOU LOVE THEM?

08:16.066 --> 08:17.227
I WANT 'EM DOWN,
ALL OF THEM.

08:17.227 --> 08:18.769
I AGREED TO A BROCHURE.

08:18.769 --> 08:21.201
"AND OTHER MARKETING MATERIALS
AND COLLATERAL."

08:21.201 --> 08:22.973
THIS IS THAT.

08:22.973 --> 08:24.535
WHAT ARE YOU ASHAMED OF,

08:24.535 --> 08:26.036
TELLING PEOPLE
THAT YOUR HOSPITAL

08:26.036 --> 08:29.039
IS MORE THAN JUST A SET OF
CLINICALLY STERILIZED WALLS

08:29.039 --> 08:30.541
AND EQUIPMENT,

08:30.541 --> 08:33.243
THAT IT IS FULL OF PEOPLE
WHO ARE INTELLIGENT

08:33.243 --> 08:35.045
AND PASSIONATE ABOUT CARING
FOR THEM?

08:35.045 --> 08:37.688
'CAUSE THAT IS WHAT
YOUR FACE TELLS PEOPLE.

08:37.688 --> 08:38.849
SAYS WHO?

08:38.849 --> 08:40.150
WELL, THREE FOCUS GROUPS
CAN'T BE WRONG.

08:40.150 --> 08:42.252
SO JUST GIVE IT A FEW DAYS.

08:42.252 --> 08:43.824
YOU'LL GET USED TO YOU.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.155
YOU READY
FOR THE NURSES?

08:45.155 --> 08:46.827
MM.

08:46.827 --> 08:47.928
(woman over P.A.)
MARCIA LOWE TO C.T.U...

08:47.928 --> 08:50.901
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME,
DEREK.

08:52.102 --> 08:53.634
(exhales) I KNOW
THIS IS NOT YOU.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.165
I KNOW THIS IS A SACRIFICE,

08:55.165 --> 08:57.067
BUT THIS SALE
IS OUR LAST SHOT,

08:57.067 --> 08:59.710
AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
FIGHTING THIS BATTLE ALONE.

08:59.710 --> 09:02.643
AND TO HAVE YOU IN THE FIGHT
WITH ME...

09:02.643 --> 09:04.114
THAT MEANS A LOT.

09:12.723 --> 09:14.084
I DON'T, UH...

09:14.084 --> 09:16.026
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

09:16.026 --> 09:18.929
OH. OH, I, UM--

09:18.929 --> 09:20.761
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NOT--NOT THIS.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.992
I WANT TO DO THIS.

09:21.992 --> 09:23.163
LOTS OF THIS.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.866
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO DO IT... HERE.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.668
I WANT TO TAKE YOU OUT
ON A DATE.

09:27.668 --> 09:28.939
SOMEPLACE THAT DOESN'T HAVE...
(laughs)

09:28.939 --> 09:30.100
WHEELS...

09:30.100 --> 09:32.572
YES, OKAY. THAT WOULD--
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.605
AND WHERE FEWER PEOPLE
HAVE BLED TO DEATH.

09:34.605 --> 09:35.776
OH, WELL,
NOW I'M TOTALLY SOLD.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.878
(laughs) TONIGHT?

09:37.878 --> 09:39.910
TONIGHT?

09:39.910 --> 09:41.852
OKAY.

09:41.852 --> 09:43.083
GREAT.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.886
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU
OUT OF THOSE CLOTHES.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.789
I MEANT... SCRUBS.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.692
UH, IN REGULAR... CLOTHES.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.323
NOT THAT YOU DON'T
LOOK GREAT IN SCRUBS,

09:53.323 --> 09:54.995
'CAUSE YOU WOULD LOOK GREAT
IN ANYTHING...
(giggles)

09:54.995 --> 09:57.067
LIKE, UH, COVERALLS
OR--

09:57.067 --> 09:58.999
OR PARKA.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.200
7:30?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.002
7:30.
MM-HMM. (giggles)

10:02.002 --> 10:05.035
OH, AND IF I'M LATE,

10:05.035 --> 10:06.737
IT'S BECAUSE I'M STILL
BANGING MY HEAD INTO A WALL

10:06.737 --> 10:08.008
OVER HOW THIS JUST WENT.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.110
IT WENT GREAT.

10:12.342 --> 10:13.714
(baby crying)

10:13.714 --> 10:14.945
COULD BE A VOLVULUS.

10:14.945 --> 10:17.187
LET'S INTUBATE
AND PUT IN AN N.G. TUBE.

10:17.187 --> 10:18.348
DRAW .8 OF ETOMIDATE.

10:18.348 --> 10:19.890
WHEN WAS
THE BABY DELIVERED?

10:19.890 --> 10:22.022
25 MINUTES AGO. VOMITING,
DISTENDED ABDOMEN.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.623
I NEED THOSE FILMS BACK,
STAT.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.797
(crying continues)

10:26.797 --> 10:28.158
GIVE ME THE ETOMIDATE.

10:28.158 --> 10:29.329
MM-HMM.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.331
SEDATIVES IN A NEWBORN
NEED A LIGHT TOUCH,

10:31.331 --> 10:33.363
SO I LIKE TO DO IT MYSELF.
(crying continues)

10:33.363 --> 10:35.035
SHH. SHH, SHH.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.907
IT'S OKAY, BUDDY.
YOU GO TO SLEEP.

10:36.907 --> 10:39.139
I PROMISE YOU WON'T REMEMBER
ANY OF THIS CRAP.

10:41.171 --> 10:42.713
WHAT ARE YOU SMILING ABOUT?

10:42.713 --> 10:44.044
NOTHING.
CUT IT OUT.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.045
WE NEED TO TELL HIS PARENTS

10:45.045 --> 10:47.217
THEIR BRAND-NEW BABY
NEEDS SURGERY.

10:47.217 --> 10:50.020
HIS BOWELS HAVE TWISTED
AROUND THE BLOOD SUPPLY,

10:50.020 --> 10:51.321
CAUSING AN OBSTRUCTION.

10:51.321 --> 10:52.683
SO...

10:52.683 --> 10:54.024
(computer beeps)
WE NEED TO DO

10:54.024 --> 10:56.256
AN EMERGENCY SURGERY
TO CORRECT THAT IMMEDIATELY.

10:56.256 --> 11:00.090
(thunderclap)

11:00.090 --> 11:03.433
SO... WE ARE GOING TO...

11:03.433 --> 11:06.396
DO THAT.

11:06.396 --> 11:09.099
(telephone ringing in distance)

11:11.842 --> 11:14.074
MR. FINCH, UH, CAN I, UH,

11:14.074 --> 11:15.706
SPEAK WITH YOU OUTSIDE
FOR A SEC?

11:18.949 --> 11:20.781
I KNOW THIS IS
A LOT TO TAKE.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.153
UM, ARE YOU
AND YOUR WIFE OKAY?

11:23.153 --> 11:24.885
WHO, LANGER? (chuckles)

11:24.885 --> 11:27.357
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW HER THAT WELL.

11:27.357 --> 11:29.359
THAT'S MY KID, BUT SHE--
BUT SHE'S NOT MY WIFE.

11:29.359 --> 11:30.861
WE WORK TOGETHER.

11:30.861 --> 11:32.022
WE HOOKED UP ONE TIME.

11:32.022 --> 11:33.263
WE TORE ONE OFF
AT AN OFFICE PARTY...

11:33.263 --> 11:34.424
AND HIS CONDOM BREAKS

11:34.424 --> 11:36.096
BECAUSE HE'S TOO CHEAP
AND STUPID

11:36.096 --> 11:37.427
TO BUY DECENT ONES.

11:37.427 --> 11:39.229
I'M ALMOST 40, I WANT A BABY,
SO I TOLD HIM,

11:39.229 --> 11:41.131
"YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK,
BUT I'M KEEPING IT."

11:41.131 --> 11:43.333
AND HE SAYS THAT HE WANTS
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.105
I'M GONNA RAISE THAT BABY.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.107
I MEAN, FINANCIALLY, YEAH,
BUT I'M GONNA BE THERE.

11:47.107 --> 11:50.480
I WANT TO, YOU KNOW...
BE A FATHER TO THAT KID.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.482
HE'S A COMPLETE ASSHAT,
BUT HE MAKES A GOOD LIVING.

11:52.482 --> 11:54.014
SHE'S A BITCH ON WHEELS,

11:54.014 --> 11:55.315
BUT SHE'S SMART
AND SHE'S TOUGH.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.887
A KID COULD DO WORSE.

11:56.887 --> 11:59.089
AND RIGHT NOW ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS MY BABY.

11:59.089 --> 12:00.991
IS MY BABY GONNA BE OKAY?

12:00.991 --> 12:02.422
TELL ME MY KID'S
GONNA BE OKAY.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.854
CAN YOU DO THAT?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.227
(whispers) WHOA.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.900
(elevator bell dings)

12:09.900 --> 12:11.161
(thunder rumbling)

12:11.161 --> 12:13.003
SO THE CHEMO DIDN'T WORK?

12:13.003 --> 12:15.035
JUST LIKE THE RADIATION.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.467
A.J.'s CANCER
HAS CONTINUED TO SPREAD.

12:17.467 --> 12:19.369
SO WHAT, SURGERY NOW?

12:19.369 --> 12:21.241
I MEAN, YOU SAID THAT
SURGERY COULD KILL HIM.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.373
YOU SAID HE WAS TOO WEAK.

12:23.373 --> 12:25.515
WELL, DR. BAILEY HERE IS
SUGGESTING ANOTHER APPROACH.

12:25.515 --> 12:28.048
YEAH,
IT'S CALLED GENOME MAPPING.

12:28.048 --> 12:31.021
IF WE CAN IDENTIFY
THE SPECIFIC D.N.A. SEQUENCE

12:31.021 --> 12:32.522
OF A.J.'s TUMOR,

12:32.522 --> 12:35.085
IT COULD OPEN UP
A VARIETY OF TREATMENT OPTIONS

12:35.085 --> 12:36.887
AND TARGETED DRUG THERAPIES.

12:36.887 --> 12:38.088
A-AND NO SURGERY?

12:38.088 --> 12:39.429
YOU CAN DO THAT HERE?

12:39.429 --> 12:40.961
UH, NO, NOT--NOT YET.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.033
WE WOULD HAVE TO CONTRACT OUT
TO ANOTHER FACILITY.

12:43.033 --> 12:44.895
I'M JUST WAITING FOR APPROVAL

12:44.895 --> 12:46.266
FROM
THE HOSPITAL ADVISORY BOARD,

12:46.266 --> 12:48.198
AND I THINK
WE'LL HAVE THAT TODAY.

12:48.198 --> 12:50.200
WE WOULD JUST NEED
TO HAVE YOUR CONSENT

12:50.200 --> 12:51.972
TO TRY--

12:53.003 --> 12:57.277
(crying)

12:57.277 --> 12:59.209
UM...

12:59.209 --> 13:02.312
WE WILL TAKE THIS AS A "YES."

13:02.312 --> 13:03.984
(continues crying)
OKAY.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.256
OKAY, I HAVE SALARY
AND BONUS BREAKDOWNS,

13:06.256 --> 13:08.819
BENEFITS PACKAGES,
PENSION STUFF--

13:08.819 --> 13:09.960
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.862
I'M NOT.
I CAN TALK TO MY PEOPLE.

13:11.862 --> 13:13.023
WELL, I HOPE SO,

13:13.023 --> 13:13.994
'CAUSE IF NOT,
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.165
YOU TRYING
TO MAKE ME NERVOUS?

13:15.165 --> 13:16.326
(Miranda)
HEY, UH, DR. HUNT?

13:16.326 --> 13:17.497
UH, BAILEY, I HAVE TO--

13:17.497 --> 13:18.869
NO, I-I JUST WONDERED

13:18.869 --> 13:20.100
WHAT YOU HEARD BACK
FROM THE ADVISORY BOARD.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.431
UH, ABOUT?

13:21.431 --> 13:23.503
ABOUT M-MY GENOME MAPPING.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.035
THE REQUEST I SUBMITTED
TO SEQUENCE--

13:25.035 --> 13:28.138
RIGHT, RIGHT. SORRY.
UM, THEY TURNED IT DOWN.

13:28.138 --> 13:30.140
WELL, NO, NO, NO. IT'S--
IT'S JUST ONE SEQUENCE...

13:30.140 --> 13:31.882
IT'S A "NO."
FOR...

13:31.882 --> 13:33.183
SORRY.

13:33.183 --> 13:36.116
(indistinct conversations)

13:36.116 --> 13:38.949
(Cristina) OKAY, SO WHAT IS
THE BIG SECRET PLAN?

13:38.949 --> 13:41.121
WE WANT TO POOL OUR WINNINGS
FROM THE LAWSUIT

13:41.121 --> 13:43.854
AND BUY THE HOSPITAL.

13:43.854 --> 13:47.297
(laughing)

13:47.297 --> 13:49.299
I WAS HOPING
YOU'D BE ON BOARD.

13:49.299 --> 13:51.161
(continues laughing)

13:51.161 --> 13:52.332
(sighs)

13:52.332 --> 13:53.864
MAYBE I MISSPOKE.

13:53.864 --> 13:56.236
(continues laughing)
SO THAT IS THE PLAN?

13:56.236 --> 13:58.408
YES.
THAT IS SO STUPID!

13:58.408 --> 14:00.410
YOU DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING
ABOUT OWNING A HOSPITAL

14:00.410 --> 14:03.173
OR RUNNING ONE,
AND NEITHER DO I.

14:03.173 --> 14:05.845
WELL, PEGASUS HORIZONS KNOWS
HOW NOT TO RUN A HOSPITAL.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.078
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD HEAR
CALLIE'S STORIES.

14:08.078 --> 14:09.219
IT'S THIS
OR GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

14:09.219 --> 14:10.850
NO. N-NO ONE LEAVES.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.182
OWEN SAYS IF PEOPLE
START LEAVING,

14:12.182 --> 14:14.154
THE SALE WON'T GO THROUGH,
AND WE'RE SCREWED.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.855
THAT'S WHY WE WANT
TO BUY IT,

14:15.855 --> 14:18.058
BECAUSE WE'RE DOCTORS,
AND WE KNOW HOW IT RUNS.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.990
DID YOU KNOW YOU'LL HAVE
TO FILE

14:19.990 --> 14:21.291
A DECLARATION FOR LAND USE

14:21.291 --> 14:23.233
FOR APPROVAL BY
THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL?

14:23.233 --> 14:24.394
WILL WE?

14:24.394 --> 14:25.565
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST MADE THAT UP.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.397
BUT SEE? WE DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

14:27.397 --> 14:30.340
I'M SURPRISED.
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE ON BOARD.

14:30.340 --> 14:31.501
OR YOU'D LEAVE AGAIN.

14:31.501 --> 14:33.143
HEY, NO ONE LEAVES.

14:33.143 --> 14:36.306
OWEN IS KILLING HIMSELF TRYING
TO KEEP THE HOSPITAL OPEN.

14:36.306 --> 14:37.647
CAN WE PLEASE
STOP TALKING NONSENSE

14:37.647 --> 14:39.109
AND HAVE HIS BACK?

14:39.109 --> 14:43.984
(thunder rumbling)

14:49.019 --> 14:51.021
(suction gurgling)

14:51.021 --> 14:52.192
HEY.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.623
OUR, UH, PANNICULECTOMY
WAS DISCHARGED.

14:53.623 --> 14:55.065
SAID TO SAY THANKS.

14:55.065 --> 14:56.596
(clicks tongue)

14:56.596 --> 14:57.968
LIPOSUCTION DAY?

14:57.968 --> 14:59.299
HIGH-VOLUME, HIGH-PRICE-TAG,

14:59.299 --> 15:02.532
'CAUSE WHEN PEGASUS TRIMS
THE FAT, SO DO I.

15:02.532 --> 15:04.474
(suction continues gurgling)

15:04.474 --> 15:07.077
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

15:07.077 --> 15:08.608
NOPE.
CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.210
WHY, 'CAUSE OF HER?

15:10.210 --> 15:11.581
MRS. BERKUS.

15:11.581 --> 15:14.314
(singsongy) MRS. BERKUS.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.446
(normal voice) MRS. BERKUS!
(laughs)

15:16.446 --> 15:18.949
UH, SHE'S BLOTTO.
WHAT'S UP?

15:18.949 --> 15:20.420
NO, I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT
TO YOU.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.953
I COULD WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS,
BUT NOW--

15:22.953 --> 15:24.254
OH, WE SERIOUSLY
CAN'T BE FRIENDS NOW?

15:24.254 --> 15:25.555
YES, WE CAN.

15:25.555 --> 15:27.257
JUST...

15:27.257 --> 15:28.959
THIS IS TOO MUCH.

15:28.959 --> 15:30.130
HOW ABOUT THIS?

15:30.130 --> 15:31.431
I WILL TELL YOU A THING

15:31.431 --> 15:33.703
I WOULD TELL YOU
WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS.

15:33.703 --> 15:37.137
MY MOM--SHE IS DRIVING ME NUTS

15:37.137 --> 15:39.409
ABOUT TAKING A BIGGER ROLE
IN THE HARPER AVERY FOUNDATION.

15:39.409 --> 15:42.272
"GROW UP, CHILD.
GET YOUR LEGACY ON."

15:42.272 --> 15:43.673
IT'S NOT BAD ADVICE.

15:43.673 --> 15:45.215
I KNOW THAT, BUT I'M
WORKING MY ASS OFF HERE,

15:45.215 --> 15:46.376
AND I'M NOT EVEN
AN ATTENDING YET.

15:46.376 --> 15:47.577
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE A CRAPPY FRIEND.

15:47.577 --> 15:48.948
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SIDE
WITH ME.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.120
I D-- (laughs)

15:50.120 --> 15:51.721
SEE? NOW YOU GO.

15:51.721 --> 15:53.683
UM...

15:53.683 --> 15:56.326
SO I'VE BEEN SEEING
THIS PARAMEDIC.

15:56.326 --> 15:58.158
I'M AWARE.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.429
TOO MUCH?

15:59.429 --> 16:02.332
NO. I TOLD YOU I WAS SEEING
STEPHANIE THE INTERN.

16:02.332 --> 16:03.463
WAS THAT TOO MUCH?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.035
NO.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT A THING.

16:05.035 --> 16:07.197
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
FUN AND--

16:07.197 --> 16:08.438
WE'RE NOT SERIOUS.

16:08.438 --> 16:10.240
WE BOTH KNOW
HOW THAT CAN TURN OUT.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.201
THAT IS TRUE.

16:11.201 --> 16:13.443
OKAY, YOUR TURN.

16:13.443 --> 16:15.305
UH, OKAY.

16:15.305 --> 16:16.976
SO...

16:16.976 --> 16:18.378
HE ASKED ME OUT...
ON A DATE,

16:18.378 --> 16:20.410
LIKE OUR FIRST REAL DATE.

16:20.410 --> 16:23.153
AND IT'S REALLY, LIKE,
OUR FIFTH DATE.

16:23.153 --> 16:25.015
AND--AND THIS REAL DATE

16:25.015 --> 16:27.317
IS PROBABLY GONNA WIND UP
AT SOMEONE'S APARTMENT.

16:27.317 --> 16:29.719
AND IT'S... GOING
IN A DIRECTION, YOU KNOW?

16:29.719 --> 16:31.221
AND IT'S ONE THING
TO TELL A GUY

16:31.221 --> 16:32.722
THAT YOU'RE A VIRGIN
AND HOPE HE UNDERSTANDS,

16:32.722 --> 16:34.764
BUT TO TELL HIM THAT I WAS
A VIRGIN AND THEN WASN'T

16:34.764 --> 16:36.426
AND NOW AM AGAIN--

16:36.426 --> 16:38.098
I JUST FEEL LIKE THERE'S NO WAY
HE'S GONNA UNDERSTAND THAT.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.269
I MEAN, WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT?

16:39.269 --> 16:41.271
BUT I REALLY LIKE HIM
AND I JUST...

16:41.271 --> 16:44.204
(exhales deeply)
IT'S ALL GONNA END TONIGHT.

16:44.204 --> 16:47.006
(chuckles)

16:48.338 --> 16:49.309
OH.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.242
OH, GOD. TOO MUCH.

16:52.242 --> 16:53.213
NOPE.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.444
OH, WAY TOO MUCH, APRIL.

16:54.444 --> 16:56.446
LOOK, TELL HIM
EXACTLY WHAT YOU TOLD ME,

16:56.446 --> 16:59.149
AND HE WON'T CARE
WHETHER YOU'RE A VIRGIN OR NOT.

16:59.149 --> 17:00.320
HE WON'T?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.092
HE'LL BE WORRIED
YOU'RE MENTALLY ILL,

17:02.092 --> 17:03.423
BECAUSE YOU SOUND LIKE
A NUT JOB.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.096
(suction gurgling)

17:06.096 --> 17:07.697
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK,
PAL.

17:07.697 --> 17:09.159
(door opens)
HEY, I'M KIDDING.

17:09.159 --> 17:10.660
NO, I KNOW. SEE YA.

17:10.660 --> 17:13.233
COME ON, APRIL.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.605
(Cristina) I GUIDE THE PARACHUTE
INTO THE HEART,

17:15.605 --> 17:17.237
OPEN IT...

17:17.237 --> 17:20.440
SO IT WILL BLOCK OFF THE DAMAGE
CAUSED BY HIS HEART ATTACK.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.771
IT SHOULD KEEP THE REST OF
HIS HEART

17:21.771 --> 17:23.243
FROM WORKING SO HARD
WHILE IT HEALS.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.544
THAT IS CRAZY BALLS.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.745
I'M IN POSITION NOW.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.077
(Stephanie, lowered voice)
WHAT DID YOUR FRIEND

17:27.077 --> 17:28.318
AT U.C. DAVIS SAY?

17:28.318 --> 17:29.419
ARE THE OTHER INTERNS
STILL DROPPING LIKE FLIES?

17:29.419 --> 17:30.580
(lowered voice) YEAH.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.222
THERE'S AT LEAST
FOUR OPENINGS.

17:32.222 --> 17:33.683
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:33.683 --> 17:35.425
MOUSY, SPEAK.

17:35.425 --> 17:37.157
(normal voice) UM,

17:37.157 --> 17:40.790
SOME OF US ARE TALKING
ABOUT...

17:40.790 --> 17:42.292
(clears throat)
LOOKING ELSEWHERE.

17:42.292 --> 17:44.264
WHY?

17:44.264 --> 17:45.435
(Stephanie, normal voice)
LAST YEAR, SEATTLE GRACE

17:45.435 --> 17:47.497
WAS THE RESIDENCY MATCH
YOU DREAMED OF GETTING.

17:47.497 --> 17:48.838
THE LAST FEW WEEKS,

17:48.838 --> 17:51.441
IT FEELS LIKE
AUTOMOTIVE TRADE SCHOOL.

17:51.441 --> 17:53.243
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

17:53.243 --> 17:54.404
GOD.

17:54.404 --> 17:56.676
WHERE IS YOUR SENSE
OF LOYALTY?

17:56.676 --> 17:58.208
THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE

17:58.208 --> 18:00.350
FIGHTING TO MAKE SURE
THIS HOSPITAL STAYS OPEN AT ALL.

18:00.350 --> 18:01.651
AND AT THE FIRST SIGN
OF TROUBLE,

18:01.651 --> 18:03.253
YOU SHOW THEM YOUR ASS?

18:03.253 --> 18:05.115
NO. NO, IT'S JUST THAT--

18:05.115 --> 18:06.586
I'M SORRY.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.118
I ONLY HAVE FIVE YEARS

18:08.118 --> 18:09.859
TO GET AS GOOD AT THIS
AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

18:09.859 --> 18:11.461
AND I WANT TO BE EXCELLENT.

18:11.461 --> 18:13.293
I WANT TO BE THE BEST,

18:13.293 --> 18:15.795
SO I CAN'T WASTE
ANOTHER MINUTE.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.797
I MEAN, WOULD YOU HAVE
WHEN YOU WERE AN INTERN?

18:17.797 --> 18:20.270
HONESTLY?

18:20.270 --> 18:24.304
(beeping continues)

18:24.304 --> 18:25.605
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:25.605 --> 18:27.507
THERE'S THE VOLVULUS.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.179
ALL RIGHT. RETRACT THERE.
MM-HMM.

18:29.179 --> 18:30.510
I'LL DISSECT.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.881
DO YOU THINK THEY CAN WORK,

18:31.881 --> 18:33.843
WORKPLACE RELATIONSHIPS?

18:33.843 --> 18:36.416
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:36.416 --> 18:37.587
LOOK AT THESE TWO--

18:37.587 --> 18:39.349
COWORKERS WHO WANTED
A QUICKIE

18:39.349 --> 18:40.450
AND GOT A BABY.

18:40.450 --> 18:42.152
WELL, THEY BOTH SEEM
TO WANT THE BABY.

18:42.152 --> 18:43.423
YEAH, BUT THEY
DON'T WANT EACH OTHER.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.255
AND NOW THEY'RE STUCK
SEEING EACH OTHER

18:45.255 --> 18:47.227
AT THE KID'S RECITALS
AND AT STAFF MEETINGS?

18:47.227 --> 18:48.428
IT'S A DISASTER, RIGHT?

18:48.428 --> 18:51.361
AH, I DON'T KNOW.
EVERYBODY'S DIFFERENT.

18:51.361 --> 18:53.603
TRUE.

18:53.603 --> 18:56.436
MM. YOU'VE HAD RELATIONSHIPS
WITH COWORKERS.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.607
YEAH.

18:57.607 --> 18:58.768
AND LOOK HOW THOSE
PLAYED OUT.

18:58.768 --> 19:00.210
YOU'RE SINGLE AND ALONE.

19:00.210 --> 19:02.372
WHEN I MET YOU, YOU HAD
A MATTRESS AND ONE BOWL.

19:02.372 --> 19:04.374
COME ON. THAT'S...

19:04.374 --> 19:07.547
YEAH, WELL...

19:07.547 --> 19:11.351
IT'S JUST... MORE TROUBLE
THAN IT'S WORTH, RIGHT?

19:11.351 --> 19:13.223
(monitor beeping erratically)

19:13.223 --> 19:14.184
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:14.184 --> 19:15.685
HEMATOMA ON THE LIVER.
IT BURST.

19:15.685 --> 19:16.886
2-0 CHROMIC.

19:16.886 --> 19:18.188
(beeping continues)

19:18.188 --> 19:19.359
CRAP. IT'S TEARING.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.390
PACK HIM.
PACK HIM GENTLY.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.932
I NEED, UH, THROMBIN
AND FIBRIN GLUE.

19:22.932 --> 19:25.735
GET SOME FACTOR VII
IN HERE NOW.
RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.

19:25.735 --> 19:27.797
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

19:27.797 --> 19:30.200
I GOT YOUR PAGE. I THOUGHT
YOU WEREN'T DOING THE A.V.M.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.471
OH, WE'RE NOT.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.274
PEGASUS WANTS TO DO
SOME PHOTOS OF ME IN SURGERY.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.206
IT'S NOT REAL.
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST PRETEND.

19:36.206 --> 19:37.377
BUT WE NEED SOME MORE BODIES.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.748
I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE
TO COME IN THERE.

19:38.748 --> 19:40.950
UH...
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR,

19:40.950 --> 19:42.212
MAY I NOT?

19:42.212 --> 19:43.683
WHAT?

19:43.683 --> 19:45.215
DR. YANG'S TESTING
A NEW PROTOCOL.

19:45.215 --> 19:46.316
I'D LEARN MORE
FROM WATCHING THAT

19:46.316 --> 19:47.717
THAN PRETENDING
TO DO SURGERY.

19:47.717 --> 19:49.319
I MEAN,
IF YOU REALLY NEED ME TO--

19:49.319 --> 19:50.460
NO.

19:50.460 --> 19:52.422
IT'S OKAY. GO.

19:52.422 --> 19:55.265
THANK YOU.

19:55.265 --> 19:57.627
(telephone ringing in distance)

20:03.373 --> 20:05.505
(exhales deeply)

20:08.238 --> 20:09.679
(people speaking indistinctly)

20:09.679 --> 20:10.840
(woman) THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

20:10.840 --> 20:14.244
I HAVE HAD THE SAME SCHEDULE
FOR SIX YEARS.

20:14.244 --> 20:15.585
AND NOW
WE'RE SPLITTING SHIFTS?

20:15.585 --> 20:18.217
MY HUSBAND WORKS TWO JOBS.
WHO PICKS UP MY KID NOW?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.720
PEGASUS BREAKS UP SHIFTS
DIFFERENTLY.
I DON'T NEED THIS.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.922
AND WE GET SHAFTED.
I'M NOT TAKING THIS.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.324
WHO'S TAKING THIS?

20:24.324 --> 20:26.356
(nurses all speaking at once)

20:26.356 --> 20:27.697
IF YOU KNOW HOW TO TALK
TO YOUR PEOPLE,

20:27.697 --> 20:29.228
YOU SHOULD START NOW.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.930
I AM.
THEY KEEP COMING BACK--
CAHILL, CHIEF.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.462
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK.

20:32.462 --> 20:34.404
NO, SHEPHERD. I'M SORRY. I'VE
BEEN WAITING FOR 20 MINUTES.

20:34.404 --> 20:36.005
CHIEF, I JUST WANTED TO
ASK YOU AGAIN

20:36.005 --> 20:37.937
ABOUT THE GENETIC SCREENING.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.709
BAILEY, I'M SORRY...
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I AM TRYING
TO WORK WITH YOU.

20:39.709 --> 20:41.771
BUT IT CANNOT BE NOW.
BUT I'M NOT GONNA RESCHEDULE
MY SURGERIES

20:41.771 --> 20:44.444
SO I CAN DO A PHOTO OP.
MAYBE WHEN THIS HOSPITAL IS ON
A FIRMER FINANCIAL FOOTING--

20:44.444 --> 20:45.945
NO, THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME
LOOKING FOR EXTRA CREDIT.
(Alana) IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF
SHOTS OF YOU IN ACTION.

20:45.945 --> 20:46.746
THIS IS ABOUT A SPECIFIC--
NO, YOU HAVE ENOUGH PICTURES
OF ME.

20:46.746 --> 20:47.917
BAILEY--
I WANT--

20:47.917 --> 20:49.279
NOW LOOK, IF YOU JUST
READ THE CHART,

20:49.279 --> 20:50.850
THEN YOU CAN TALK
TO THE STUPID BOARD...

20:50.850 --> 20:52.352
BAILEY...
AND MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND--

20:52.352 --> 20:53.553
BAILEY, THEY DIDN'T SAY NO.
I DID.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.325
I DIDN'T BRING IT UP TO THEM

20:55.325 --> 20:57.357
BECAUSE IT WILL NOT
BE APPROVED.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.959
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA--

20:59.959 --> 21:01.331
THE ANSWER'S NO, BAILEY.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.465
YES, SIR.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.597
NEVER MIND THEN.

21:12.001 --> 21:13.773
WHAT IS IT, SHEPHERD?

21:13.773 --> 21:15.845
NOTHING. I'M GOOD.

21:20.750 --> 21:22.582
IT'S DEREK SHEPHERD.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.584
I HAVE AN IDEA,
A CRAZY IDEA,

21:24.584 --> 21:31.591
AND I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
HOW CRAZY.

21:36.496 --> 21:39.499
(thunder rumbling)

21:44.474 --> 21:47.337
(clicks)

21:50.309 --> 21:51.511
WHOA.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.842
THIS ISN'T WEIRD.

21:52.842 --> 21:54.814
I KNOW. I WANTED TO MEET
OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.315
AND THEN WITH THE RAIN--

21:56.315 --> 21:58.087
NO, I LIKE IT.
IT'S VERY CLOAK-AND-DAGGERY.

21:58.087 --> 21:59.789
YOU MUST BE DR. TORRES.
OH, GOD!

21:59.789 --> 22:01.521
CALLIE TORRES,
STAN GROSSBERG.

22:01.521 --> 22:02.992
HE'S MY FINANCIAL ADVISOR.

22:02.992 --> 22:04.994
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE DIED
FOR A SECOND.

22:04.994 --> 22:06.856
I ASKED HIM ABOUT
THE FEASIBILITY OF OUR IDEA.

22:06.856 --> 22:08.858
STAN, TELL HER
WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

22:08.858 --> 22:10.360
UNDER FEDERAL LAW,

22:10.360 --> 22:12.632
PHYSICIANS CANNOT OWN
AND RUN THE HOSPITAL

22:12.632 --> 22:14.464
FOR WHICH THEY WORK.

22:14.464 --> 22:15.805
SO WE'RE HOSED.

22:15.805 --> 22:18.668
HOWEVER, YOU COULD ALLY
YOURSELVES WITH A FOR-PROFIT

22:18.668 --> 22:20.640
OR NOT-FOR-PROFIT AGENCY,

22:20.640 --> 22:22.572
WHICH WOULD BE
OWNER PRO FORMA.

22:22.572 --> 22:25.815
THEN THE FIVE OF YOU COULD FORM
YOUR OWN MANAGEMENT COMPANY,

22:25.815 --> 22:28.818
WHICH WOULD BE HIRED
BY THIS FOUNDATION.

22:28.818 --> 22:30.850
SO WE'RE NOT HOSED.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.383
BASICALLY, YOU WOULD RUN
THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS,

22:33.383 --> 22:35.625
MUCH LIKE
A BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

22:35.625 --> 22:38.458
AND AGAIN I ASK,
WHO WANTS TO DO THAT?

22:38.458 --> 22:40.089
JUST LET HIM FINISH.

22:40.089 --> 22:41.991
I'M SORRY, BUT I'D RATHER
BE IN AN OPERATING ROOM

22:41.991 --> 22:43.362
THAN A BOARDROOM.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.664
BESIDES, I THOUGHT
WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

22:44.664 --> 22:45.835
TO DO THIS ANYWAY.

22:45.835 --> 22:47.366
WELL, I'M WORKING ON THAT.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.838
ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF BEDS,

22:48.838 --> 22:50.640
THE, UH,
OVERALL OPERATING BUDGET,

22:50.640 --> 22:52.141
THE PROPERTY
AND BUSINESS TAXES,

22:52.141 --> 22:54.404
THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD
PAYMENTS...

22:54.404 --> 22:55.675
OKAY, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.507
I'M ASKING, IS IT POSSIBLE
FOR US TO DO?

22:57.507 --> 23:00.009
THAT'S WHAT HE'S SAYING.
IT IS POSSIBLE.

23:00.009 --> 23:01.911
IT IS VERY POSSIBLE.

23:01.911 --> 23:04.153
OKAY, WELL, HOW MUCH
MORE MONEY WOULD WE NEED?

23:04.153 --> 23:06.015
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING,
I-I DON'T KNOW.

23:06.015 --> 23:09.018
NOT UNTIL I SEE
A HOSPITAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT.

23:09.018 --> 23:10.560
HOW DO WE GET THAT?

23:10.560 --> 23:13.122
OWEN CAN GET THAT FOR US.

23:14.724 --> 23:16.526
UM...

23:16.526 --> 23:18.768
IF WE HAVE A HOPE
OF OUTBIDDING PEGASUS,

23:18.768 --> 23:21.771
THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE
IS SORT OF CRUCIAL HERE.

23:21.771 --> 23:23.703
OWEN CAN'T KNOW
ANY OF THIS.

23:23.703 --> 23:26.405
WE'RE GONNA GO BEHIND OWEN'S
BACK TO STEAL THE HOSPITAL?

23:26.405 --> 23:27.707
NO,
OWEN WILL STILL BE CHIEF.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.109
HE'S LEGALLY OBLIGATED
TO TELL THEM OF ANYTHING

23:30.109 --> 23:31.781
THAT MIGHT INTERFERE
WITH THE SALE.

23:31.781 --> 23:34.113
HE SIGNED NONCOMPETES,
NONDISCLOSURES.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.045
IF HE BREACHES THEM,
THEY WILL FIRE HIM.

23:36.045 --> 23:37.517
THEY WILL SUE HIM.

23:37.517 --> 23:40.950
THERE COULD EVEN BE
JAIL TIME.

23:40.950 --> 23:42.191
HE CAN'T KNOW
ANY OF THIS.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.525
YOU WANT ME TO LIE TO HIM.

23:45.525 --> 23:48.027
NO, I WANT YOU TO JUST
NOT SAY ANYTHING FOR NOW.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.959
YOU WANT ME TO LIE TO HIM.

23:49.959 --> 23:51.831
(door opens)

23:51.831 --> 23:53.463
(door closes)

23:53.463 --> 23:55.164
THE NURSES
AREN'T BEING UNREASONABLE.

23:55.164 --> 23:56.736
THEY HAVE VALID CONCERNS.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.067
AND I'M WORRIED

23:58.067 --> 23:59.809
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS.

23:59.809 --> 24:01.140
YEAH, WELL, I'M WORRIED
YOU'RE ASKING ME

24:01.140 --> 24:02.812
TO SELL THEM SOMETHING
THAT I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE IN.

24:02.812 --> 24:04.443
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.215
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
SWALLOW SOME BITTER PILLS

24:06.215 --> 24:07.577
IN ORDER TO GET WELL.

24:07.577 --> 24:08.778
THIS IS A BAD PILL.

24:08.778 --> 24:09.979
YEAH, WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL 'EM THAT?

24:09.979 --> 24:12.451
THEY NEED TO HEAR IT
FROM SOMEONE THEY TRUST.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.123
(pen clatters)

24:14.123 --> 24:15.725
OKAY.

24:15.725 --> 24:18.888
DO YOU REMEMBER LAST WEEK
WHEN WE OPERATED, THE LOGGER?

24:18.888 --> 24:22.231
BEFORE THAT, I DIDN'T THINK
THAT I EVER WOULD

24:22.231 --> 24:25.464
OR COULD STEP UP
TO AN O.R. TABLE AGAIN.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.467
I WAS SCARED
THE WHOLE TIME.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.239
AS SCARED AS I HAVE
EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE.

24:30.239 --> 24:32.602
I HAD NO IDEA.
I KNOW.

24:34.604 --> 24:38.477
THE ONLY REASON
I WAS ABLE TO DO IT...

24:38.477 --> 24:40.479
WAS BECAUSE YOU WERE THERE.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.652
AND I BARELY EVEN KNEW YOU.

24:42.652 --> 24:46.856
BUT YOU WERE SO CALM
AND SURE.

24:46.856 --> 24:51.490
AND IF YOU WERE OKAY,
I WOULD BE OKAY.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.123
NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE
THIS QUALITY.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.569
WHAT HAPPENED? CAN I ASK?

24:59.569 --> 25:02.201
IT'S NOT A GOOD STORY.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.903
SORRY.
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.676
NO, I MEAN, IT'S--
IT'S NOT AN INTERESTING STORY.

25:06.676 --> 25:08.778
YOU'VE HEARD IT
A HUNDRED TIMES.

25:08.778 --> 25:11.510
I CHOKED IS ALL.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.112
(exhales)

25:18.548 --> 25:20.119
LISTEN...
(taps tabletop)

25:20.119 --> 25:22.251
I AM GOOD AT THIS JOB.

25:22.251 --> 25:25.224
SO YOU CAN BELIEVE ME
WHEN I TELL YOU

25:25.224 --> 25:29.058
THAT ONLY YOU CAN HELP
THESE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

25:29.058 --> 25:32.101
THAT SOMETHING THAT HURTS THEM
IN THE SHORT RUN

25:32.101 --> 25:34.533
WILL HELP THEM
IN THE LONG RUN.

25:34.533 --> 25:39.839
WHEN YOU TELL SOMEONE
THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY,

25:39.839 --> 25:42.642
THEY'LL TRUST YOU.

25:44.774 --> 25:46.275
YOU KNOW
YOU HOLD THIS PLACE TOGETHER.

25:46.275 --> 25:50.620
EVERY DOCTOR AND EVERY PATIENT
HERE KNOWS THAT.

25:50.620 --> 25:52.321
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE
THE CORNERSTONES.

25:52.321 --> 25:54.754
I NEED YOU TO BE STRONG
RIGHT NOW

25:54.754 --> 25:56.656
IN THIS TRANSITION.

25:56.656 --> 25:57.827
(door squeaks)

25:57.827 --> 26:00.830
TRANSITIONS ARE SCARY,
I KNOW.

26:00.830 --> 26:03.593
BUT BELIEVE ME, I...

26:03.593 --> 26:06.065
I WOULD NOT BE ASKING YOU
TO GO THROUGH THIS

26:06.065 --> 26:09.238
IF I DID NOT BELIEVE THAT WHAT
PEGASUS HORIZONS OFFERS

26:09.238 --> 26:12.171
IS THE BEST THING
FOR ALL OF US.

26:12.171 --> 26:16.305
I MEAN, IF I DIDN'T,
I WOULD LEAVE WITH YOU.

26:16.305 --> 26:17.276
(rainfall)

26:17.276 --> 26:19.578
I'M ASKING YOU TO STAY,

26:19.578 --> 26:21.080
TRUST ME,

26:21.080 --> 26:22.311
WORK WITH ME.

26:22.311 --> 26:24.083
JUST...

26:24.083 --> 26:27.056
HELP ME
GET US THROUGH THIS.

26:28.958 --> 26:30.189
CAN WE DO THAT?

26:35.765 --> 26:38.297
WE CAN TRY.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.269
RIGHT?

26:40.269 --> 26:42.231
(woman) I'LL TRY.
(man) GIVE IT A GO.

26:42.231 --> 26:45.134
(nurses murmuring)

26:50.179 --> 26:52.281
(Alex) I CAN TRY TO REPAIR
THE LIVER,

26:52.281 --> 26:53.983
BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY DELICATE,

26:53.983 --> 26:57.316
AND THERE'S A HIGH RISK THAT
IT WILL BE PERMANENTLY DAMAGED.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.688
AND THE BABY DIES.

26:58.688 --> 26:59.849
IT'S A RISK.

26:59.849 --> 27:01.250
THE OTHER OPTION IS,
WE SIT TIGHT

27:01.250 --> 27:03.392
AND HOPE THE BLEEDING
STOPS ON ITS OWN.

27:03.392 --> 27:04.754
AND HOPE HE SURVIVES THAT.

27:09.358 --> 27:10.730
WHAT?
WHAT, WHAT?

27:10.730 --> 27:11.901
SAY SOMETHING.

27:11.901 --> 27:13.763
DECIDE. (huffs)

27:13.763 --> 27:16.065
(sighs)

27:16.065 --> 27:18.267
WELL, I SAY WE WAIT.
DON'T DO ANYTHING.

27:18.267 --> 27:19.939
RIGHT.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.240
NO, THAT'S STUPID.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.843
DO THE SURGERY.
NO, I DON'T KNOW.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.314
I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T...

27:25.314 --> 27:27.747
(crying) I CAN'T DECIDE.

27:27.747 --> 27:30.079
I CAN'T.
I CAN'T DO THIS.

27:30.079 --> 27:31.220
YOU DO IT. I CAN'T.

27:31.220 --> 27:32.752
HEY, HEY, HEY!
(exhales)

27:32.752 --> 27:34.223
LISTEN,

27:34.223 --> 27:36.826
WE BOTH DECIDE.

27:36.826 --> 27:38.157
OKAY? I'M SCARED, TOO.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.789
I'M--I'M AS SCARED AS YOU ARE,

27:39.789 --> 27:42.732
BUT YOU ARE THE BIGGEST,
MEANEST, BALLBUSTING,

27:42.732 --> 27:45.394
ICE-QUEEN, NIGHTMARE BITCH
THAT I HAVE EVER MET.

27:45.394 --> 27:49.268
SO IF I CAN DO THIS,
YOU CAN.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.440
OKAY?

27:51.440 --> 27:53.843
(exhales)

27:53.843 --> 27:56.675
(rainfall)

27:56.675 --> 27:58.247
L-LET'S...

27:59.849 --> 28:01.210
WAIT.

28:01.210 --> 28:02.782
(exhales)

28:02.782 --> 28:05.014
OKAY.

28:05.014 --> 28:06.756
CAN I HAVE A GLASS OF WATER,
PLEASE?

28:06.756 --> 28:08.387
AND A MAXI PAD
FOR MY GIRLFRIEND HERE.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.259
NICE.

28:10.259 --> 28:11.360
(sniffles)

28:11.360 --> 28:12.892
(Derek) LOOK AT THAT.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.463
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT
THEY'RE UP THERE AT ALL,

28:14.463 --> 28:16.325
AND NOW I HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THIS?

28:16.325 --> 28:17.366
WE'LL PUT A STOP TO IT.

28:17.366 --> 28:18.898
I'LL HAVE THIS ONE
TAKEN DOWN.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.299
I WANT THEM ALL
TAKEN DOWN.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.071
(sighs)
(elevator bell dings)

28:22.071 --> 28:23.272
I DIDN'T DO IT.

28:23.272 --> 28:24.774
(telephone ringing)

28:30.980 --> 28:32.311
DO YOU BELIEVE IT?

28:32.311 --> 28:33.312
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

28:33.312 --> 28:34.844
WHAT YOU SAID
TO THE NURSES--

28:34.844 --> 28:36.916
"PEGASUS WILL LEAD US
TO A BRIGHTER TOMORROW."

28:36.916 --> 28:38.918
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

28:38.918 --> 28:40.089
(exhales)

28:40.089 --> 28:41.320
IT IS THE ONLY OPTION
THAT WE--

28:41.320 --> 28:43.392
HEY, IT'S JUST US NOW.

28:43.392 --> 28:44.493
IT'S ME.

28:44.493 --> 28:45.925
(sighs)

28:45.925 --> 28:47.757
(rainfall)

28:47.757 --> 28:49.198
NO.

28:49.198 --> 28:52.201
NO, OKAY? NO.
NO, I DON'T.

28:52.201 --> 28:54.233
IT'S A BITTER PILL,
AND WE JUST HAVE TO SWALLOW IT.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.335
AND HONESTLY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF THIS IS GONNA MAKE US

28:56.335 --> 28:58.367
BETTER OR WORSE.
THEN WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING
SO HARD FOR SOMETHING--

28:58.367 --> 28:59.869
THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE.

28:59.869 --> 29:01.370
THIS IS OUR ONLY SHOT.

29:01.370 --> 29:03.372
OKAY, BUT WHAT--
WHAT IF IT WASN'T, THOUGH?

29:03.372 --> 29:05.344
WHAT IF IT'S NOT ALL ON YOU
TO FIX EVERYTHING--

29:05.344 --> 29:07.316
BUT IT IS. IT IS ALL ON ME.
NO, OWEN, OWEN, LISTEN--

29:07.316 --> 29:09.378
IT'S--
I PUT YOU ALL ON THAT PLANE.

29:09.378 --> 29:11.080
(cell phone rings and buzzes)

29:11.080 --> 29:13.222
(rings and buzzes)

29:13.222 --> 29:15.124
I'M SORRY. IT'S... CAHILL.

29:15.124 --> 29:16.285
(beeps)
YEAH.

29:17.987 --> 29:19.758
WHAT?

29:21.831 --> 29:24.193
TODAY? (huffs)

29:24.193 --> 29:25.995
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, THAT IS--

29:25.995 --> 29:27.897
THAT'S... AMAZING.

29:27.897 --> 29:30.399
UM, I'LL COME FIND YOU.
OKAY.

29:30.399 --> 29:31.370
(beep)
WHAT?

29:31.370 --> 29:33.042
(sighs)

29:33.042 --> 29:35.004
IT'S ALMOST OVER.

29:35.004 --> 29:38.007
(rainfall continues)

29:38.007 --> 29:39.348
(people speaking indistinctly)

29:39.348 --> 29:40.379
THIS IS SO STUPID.

29:40.379 --> 29:41.480
(lowered voice)
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY

29:41.480 --> 29:42.852
I CAN THINK
OF GETTING IN THERE.

29:42.852 --> 29:44.013
SO WE'RE
IN A HEIST MOVIE NOW?

29:44.013 --> 29:45.314
STAN NEEDS TO SEE
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

29:45.314 --> 29:47.286
I WILL SCHMOOZE, DISTRACT,
AND THEN YOU--

29:47.286 --> 29:48.457
WHAT,
STICK ONE DOWN MY SHIRT?

29:48.457 --> 29:50.459
I DON'T KNOW.

29:50.459 --> 29:53.222
ALL RIGHT, JUST...
LET'S GO. GET ME IN THERE.

29:53.222 --> 29:55.995
(Derek clears throat,
door opens)

29:55.995 --> 29:58.397
GENTLEMEN AND LADIES,
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU,

29:58.397 --> 30:00.269
BUT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY WIFE, DR. MEREDITH GREY.

30:00.269 --> 30:02.171
WHAT A PLEASURE IT IS
TO MEET YOU, SIR.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

30:02.171 --> 30:03.332
OH! OH, MY GOODNESS.
OH, OH.

30:03.332 --> 30:04.573
I'M SO SORRY.
MEREDITH.

30:04.573 --> 30:06.575
OH, NO. I-I AM
A LITTLE CLUMSY.
I AM SO SORRY.

30:06.575 --> 30:09.839
(Arizona) THEY ARE NOT APPROVING
THE GENOME MAPPING AT THIS TIME.

30:09.839 --> 30:11.040
BUT YOU SAID THAT--

30:11.040 --> 30:12.942
WE WERE SURE THAT IT WAS
GONNA GO THE OTHER WAY.

30:12.942 --> 30:14.113
SO I'M SORRY.

30:14.113 --> 30:16.315
SO NOW WE'RE BACK
TO A COLECTOMY.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.848
I WANT TO WAIT ANOTHER DAY
TO SEE IF A.J. IMPROVES,

30:18.848 --> 30:21.520
BUT... IT NEEDS TO BE SOON.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.053
I-IS THAT
OUR ONLY OPTION?

30:24.053 --> 30:25.524
YEAH,
I'M AFRAID THAT THAT'S--

30:25.524 --> 30:27.396
NO.
THERE'S ONE OTHER OPTION.

30:27.396 --> 30:30.329
YOU CAN GO

30:30.329 --> 30:33.062
SOMEPLACE THAT WILL FIND
AN APPROACH

30:33.062 --> 30:34.403
THAT WORKS FOR HIM,

30:34.403 --> 30:36.835
SOMEPLACE THAT WILL GIVE HIM
THE CARE THAT HE DESERVES.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.267
HE WON'T GET THAT HERE.

30:38.267 --> 30:40.469
I SAY LEAVE.

30:40.469 --> 30:45.274
LEAVE SEATTLE GRACE
AND GO SOMEPLACE ELSE, FAST.

30:53.182 --> 30:54.323
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

30:54.323 --> 30:55.454
THAT WAS
THE ONLY MEDICAL ADVICE

30:55.454 --> 30:56.555
I COULD GIVE THEM
IN GOOD CONSCIENCE.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.157
I'M THINKING I NEED
TO TAKE IT MYSELF.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.628
HEY, WHOA.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

30:59.628 --> 31:01.230
I TRIED.

31:01.230 --> 31:03.392
I TRIED TO PUT ON THE SMILE
AND KNUCKLE DOWN

31:03.392 --> 31:04.894
AND MAKE IT WORK,

31:04.894 --> 31:06.365
BUT MAYBE I CAN GET A JOB
IN L.A.,

31:06.365 --> 31:07.897
BE WHERE MY HUSBAND IS,

31:07.897 --> 31:09.438
AND TUCK... (whimpers)

31:09.438 --> 31:12.071
TUCK'S DAD'S NEVER GONNA LET ME
MOVE HIM OUT OF THE CITY--

IS AN ART FORM.

40:36.765 --> 40:37.906
(door slams)

40:37.906 --> 40:40.008
YET, WHEN WE NEGOTIATE...

40:40.008 --> 40:44.072
HIS B.P. LOOKS GOOD.
HIS LABS LOOK GREAT.

40:44.072 --> 40:45.443
WE'LL WATCH HIM CLOSELY
OVERNIGHT,

40:45.443 --> 40:46.675
BUT I THINK
HE'S GONNA BE JUST FINE.

40:46.675 --> 40:47.776
(Finch and Langer) THANK YOU.

40:47.776 --> 40:49.578
WE HAVE A STRATEGY,
WE USE TACTICS.

40:49.578 --> 40:51.019
ALL RIGHT, CAN YOU PLEASE
MOVE YOUR FAT HEAD

40:51.019 --> 40:52.551
SO I CAN GET A LOOK?

40:52.551 --> 40:54.783

THAT KID'S NEXT 18 YEARS.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.492
HEY, YOU WANT TO GO
GET A BEER?

41:03.492 --> 41:05.834
OH, I WOULD LOVE TO,
ESPECIALLY AFTER TODAY,

41:05.834 --> 41:07.736
BUT, UM, I ACTUALLY

41:07.736 --> 41:09.538
ALREADY HAVE PLANS.

TOMORROW NIGHT?
IS THAT COOL?

41:10.669 --> 41:11.840
YEAH, THAT'S COOL.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.902
OKAY.

41:13.902 --> 41:15.704
HEY.
HMM?

41:15.704 --> 41:17.506
WHO IS THAT GUY?

41:17.506 --> 41:19.608
THAT IS...

41:19.608 --> 41:20.749
CHEST PECKWELL.

41:20.749 --> 41:22.050
WHAT?

41:22.050 --> 41:23.582
IT'S NOT HIS REAL NAME.

41:23.582 --> 41:24.953
WE JUST CALLED HIM THAT
BEFORE WE KNEW IT.

41:24.953 --> 41:26.585
(both speaking indistinctly)
O.B. RESIDENT.

41:26.585 --> 41:27.916
JO'S BEEN MOONING OVER THE GUY
SINCE HE GOT HERE,

41:27.916 --> 41:29.788
AND SHE FINALLY GREW HERSELF
A PAIR AND ASKED HIM OUT.

41:29.788 --> 41:31.489
YAY, JO. (chuckles)

41:31.489 --> 41:32.821
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT HIM?

41:32.821 --> 41:34.623
YEAH, SHE DID.

41:34.623 --> 41:37.065
OKAY. (laughs)

THOSE ARE WORDS
FOR GOING TO WAR.

41:55.283 --> 41:57.115
THE FIRST THING YOU'LL NEED
TO DO IS TO FORM AN L.L.C.

41:57.115 --> 42:00.118
SO THAT YOU CAN LEGALLY GET
ALL YOUR FUNDS IN ONE PLACE.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.751
AND YOU'LL NEED A NAME
FOR YOUR NEW CORPORATION.

42:02.751 --> 42:04.092
(rainfall)

42:04.092 --> 42:05.654
WHAT DID WE JUST DO?

42:05.654 --> 42:07.556
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'D LIKE
TO CALL YOURSELVES?

42:07.556 --> 42:10.098
HOW ABOUT
"THE BITTER PILLS"?

42:10.098 --> 42:11.660
(sets glass down)
"EPIC FAILURE"?

42:11.660 --> 42:12.801
"DEATH SPIRAL"?

42:12.801 --> 42:15.203
"BLIND LEADING THE BLIND,
INCORPORATED"?

42:15.203 --> 42:18.867
IT COULD BE ANYTHING.
