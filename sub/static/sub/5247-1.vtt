them, the blood-gatherer,</i>

<i>I've brought them the lost ones,</i>

the desperate ones.</i>

00:29.819 --> 00:32.270
<i>Now I am free,</i>

00:36.609 --> 00:38.442
<i>They are thirsty for revenge,</i>

00:38.528 --> 00:40.578
<i>and nothing will stop them.</i>

<i>No boundaries, no borders.</i>

00:43.616 --> 00:45.249
<i>They will come for me,</i>

You don't have to stop there.

02:26.469 --> 02:29.637
It's payday. You know
about our bonus program?

[Buzzing sound]

02:36.813 --> 02:38.896
Damn, you've got a tight little body.

02:39.032 --> 02:40.448
A dancer's body.

02:41.951 --> 02:44.368
Maybe you can dance for me.

02:44.470 --> 02:46.287
<i>¿Baila para</i> me?

02:46.406 --> 02:48.239
That's my specialty.

You speak English.

02:50.543 --> 02:52.076
[Hammer cocks]

02:52.161 --> 02:53.911
A private dance will cost you.

02:54.047 --> 02:55.230
You want to see her paperwork?

02:55.231 --> 02:56.274
I've got her papers, man.

02:59.218 --> 03:00.501
Okay, places, everyone.

03:14.434 --> 03:15.766
Hey.

03:15.902 --> 03:18.436
You're running cash in
your trucks, Mister...

03:18.538 --> 03:20.654
Balthazar Ambrose.

03:20.773 --> 03:24.241
What are you, a Hanna-Barbera character?

03:24.327 --> 03:26.444
We're here to take it.

03:26.579 --> 03:28.112
You ain't takin' diddly.

03:28.247 --> 03:29.864
Actually, that's true.

03:31.534 --> 03:33.534
You're gonna give it to us.

03:34.871 --> 03:36.837
[Shrieking]

03:40.042 --> 03:42.311
I asked her to leave the drama at the door.

03:42.312 --> 03:43.925
That's supposed to scare me?

03:43.926 --> 03:46.180

03:48.968 --> 03:50.634
Well, look at you.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.353
They let you in the club?

03:52.472 --> 03:55.556
I'm not of the tribe,
if that's what you mean.

03:55.641 --> 03:58.609
I like my summers on the
beach, thank you very much.

03:58.694 --> 04:00.978
I sure as shit know your ways.

04:01.063 --> 04:04.031
I know you two, now
I've seen you in action.

04:04.150 --> 04:08.652
You're the showgirl who thinks
she's going to take down an empire.

04:08.788 --> 04:10.704
No.

04:10.823 --> 04:13.124
I'm just going to kill the emperor.

04:13.209 --> 04:15.826
- Good luck with that.
- This isn't your fight.

04:15.912 --> 04:18.495
Make it easy on yourself.

04:19.548 --> 04:21.048
Take us to the loot.

04:29.142 --> 04:30.891
Tell your boys to step off.

04:30.977 --> 04:33.511
It's all right, guys. It's okay.

04:33.646 --> 04:35.479
Just want to see the cash truck.

04:37.016 --> 04:39.433
Want my best guys out here to help unload.

04:44.857 --> 04:46.023

[Fearsome growl]

05:04.377 --> 05:06.427
Still grosses me out, kiddo.

05:06.546 --> 05:10.047
Put 'em on ice, get ready for transport.

05:10.183 --> 05:14.101

06:36.552 --> 06:40.137
- Meatpacking plant.
- Just outside Houston.

06:40.222 --> 06:42.306
Pretty sure it's part of the syndicate.

06:42.441 --> 06:46.060
Did a little recon, but now
it's time for the real work.

06:46.145 --> 06:47.811
I want you with me.

06:47.897 --> 06:50.814
Not another stakeout, please.

06:53.069 --> 06:54.151
So, uh...

06:54.287 --> 06:56.620
that whole thing.

06:57.790 --> 07:00.124
That was new.

07:00.209 --> 07:03.661
- You didn't like it?
- I didn't say that.

07:03.796 --> 07:04.828
Good.

07:22.148 --> 07:25.182
Oh, boy. He's back to the turquoise.

07:27.236 --> 07:29.069
This guy's got a bolo collection

07:29.188 --> 07:31.021
like Uncle Eddie's video stash.

07:31.107 --> 07:32.990
This one's got nice aiguillettes.

07:33.075 --> 07:36.327
Richard, it's daytime.
We should be sleeping.

07:36.412 --> 07:39.530
Like that guy in that moving
picture you made me watch,

07:39.665 --> 07:40.998
with the tuxedo.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.166
Belushi?

07:42.251 --> 07:44.585
Lugosi. Bela Lugosi.

07:44.704 --> 07:46.870
I would like to sleep like him.

07:46.956 --> 07:50.507
We've got to do this.
This is why I came back.

07:50.593 --> 07:54.428
His operation is connected
north of the border.

07:54.547 --> 07:56.430
There's no borders for this man.

07:56.549 --> 07:58.048
Just find and kill him.

07:58.184 --> 08:00.217
We need him to make a move.

08:00.353 --> 08:02.052
We've got to jack this place.

08:02.188 --> 08:05.105
We hit him where he lives,
find out where he lives.

08:05.224 --> 08:09.226
Look for the man in black
with the dirty smile.

08:09.311 --> 08:11.895
I asked about a cartel that comes at night.

08:11.981 --> 08:12.701
We're not a cartel.

08:12.725 --> 08:13.948
Yeah. I'm kidding.

08:13.949 --> 08:16.567
Ask enough grunts, they'll tell you.

08:16.652 --> 08:20.070
There's an outfit. They got their
fingers real deep in Houston.

08:20.094 --> 08:20.973
Nobody knows their name.

08:20.974 --> 08:24.462
They've got pot houses, count
houses, stash houses. You name it.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.877
But none of the product is actually theirs.

08:26.962 --> 08:29.380
They just hold, transport, deliver.

08:30.549 --> 08:32.049
And take their cut.

08:32.134 --> 08:34.918
They don't take. It's given to them.

08:35.004 --> 08:37.254
For centuries, it's tribute.

08:37.390 --> 08:40.090
- Tribute?
- Tribute, yeah.

08:40.176 --> 08:44.260
Of all the Nine Lords, Malvado
was the <i> pochtecatl.</i>

08:44.346 --> 08:45.896
Collector of tribute.

08:45.981 --> 08:48.732
When their armies would
destroy your village,

08:48.818 --> 08:50.567
they would take everything,

08:50.653 --> 08:52.603
take what was theirs:

08:52.738 --> 08:55.773
women, gold, weapons.

08:55.908 --> 08:56.908
Children.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.994
When they took you,
they took you completely.

09:02.448 --> 09:04.698
He who dies with the most toys wins.

09:04.784 --> 09:07.084
Amancio Malvado...

09:08.621 --> 09:12.005
doesn't own anything.

09:12.124 --> 09:13.874
He possesses it.

09:15.261 --> 09:17.594
When he has you, it's like...

09:18.764 --> 09:21.799
<i>the air you breathe is a gift.</i>

09:23.636 --> 09:26.186
<i>He who dies with the most toys wins.</i>

09:28.057 --> 09:29.807
He never dies.

[Music playing]

09:44.707 --> 09:46.707
What are you looking at?

09:46.826 --> 09:49.793
I'm captivated by the show.

09:49.879 --> 09:52.296
Let me know if someone stops to watch it.

[Chains rattle]

09:54.917 --> 09:55.917
Man: <i> Jefe.</i>

09:57.553 --> 09:58.669
He's here.

_

10:33.196 --> 10:33.945
<i>Jefe.</i>

10:34.039 --> 10:35.539
You call this a show?

10:35.624 --> 10:37.207
You insult me.

10:37.309 --> 10:39.593
You disrespect her.

10:39.712 --> 10:43.514
Until she's back, this place is shut down.

10:43.599 --> 10:46.049
<i>Jefe,</i> there is a thirst.

10:46.135 --> 10:48.769
We need the souls this place provides.

10:48.888 --> 10:51.638
This was her palace.

10:51.724 --> 10:52.724
And hers alone.

10:55.277 --> 10:57.861
You are nothing but a <i> descarado.</i>

10:57.947 --> 10:59.813
<i>Jefe,</i> I meant no disrespect.

11:01.567 --> 11:04.735

I'm fine. I was just reading
the Bible and praying.

12:57.576 --> 13:01.294
Okay. Sorry. I had to
make sure you were safe.

13:01.413 --> 13:04.965
Servants of God need all the
protection they can get around here.

13:05.084 --> 13:07.134
Don't I know that. Thank you.

No.

- <i>Gracias.
- Bueno.</i>

_

13:23.102 --> 13:24.735
What the hell was that?

13:26.572 --> 13:28.438
That was you obfuscating.

13:28.524 --> 13:30.607
That's not what I meant.
I meant the check cashing store.

13:30.692 --> 13:33.160
- What happened?
- Nothing.

13:33.278 --> 13:35.862
Things got a little dicey, that's all.

13:35.948 --> 13:39.082
Oh, dicey? I thought you said everything
was going to be lean and mean.

13:39.168 --> 13:41.618
I don't know that I used those exact words.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.703
"Stroll" was the word you used.

13:43.789 --> 13:46.289
You said: "Kate, I'm going to
stroll out like Paul Newman,

13:46.425 --> 13:49.926
you'll be waiting in the car and then we'll
drive away like we got a free toaster."

13:50.012 --> 13:52.045
- I owe you a toaster.
- Not funny.

13:52.131 --> 13:54.892
The manager tried to be a hero. So I
had to rough him up a little bit.

13:55.801 --> 13:59.302
Some knucklehead called his cousin, a cop.

13:59.438 --> 14:03.056
How was he able to do that? Weren't
you keeping an eye on him?

14:03.142 --> 14:04.691
I only have two eyes.

14:04.810 --> 14:07.490
That's what I mean. You need more
than two eyes. You need a partner.

14:07.529 --> 14:09.112
Okay. Will you stop? We won.

14:12.734 --> 14:13.867
Here.

14:13.986 --> 14:14.986
Huh?

14:19.408 --> 14:22.209
- These are canceled checks.
- What?

14:23.796 --> 14:25.829
- Unbelievable!
- Son of a bitch!

14:25.964 --> 14:29.466
Three months of stupid towns
and the same old bullshit.

14:31.220 --> 14:35.005
It's kinda been a downhill slide
ever since the Corvette was stolen.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.224
I feel like I joined a freaking circus.

14:37.342 --> 14:38.508
Okay, I get it.

14:38.644 --> 14:42.145
Maybe I would have been better off alone.

14:42.231 --> 14:46.233
I probably would have made a killing
as Richie's knife-throwing girl.

14:46.351 --> 14:48.652
Hey. Now it's not a total lost.
We still have the cash.

14:48.737 --> 14:50.237
That is not enough.

14:50.355 --> 14:53.523
You said it yourself. We need
passports, we need new names.

14:53.609 --> 14:54.908
I want to get out of here.

14:55.027 --> 14:56.326
And go where?

14:57.362 --> 14:58.528
To find Scott.

14:59.748 --> 15:02.199
I said that I would forget him but I can't.

15:02.334 --> 15:05.702
Listen to me very carefully. He's dead.

15:05.787 --> 15:08.371
Even if he's alive, he's dead.

15:08.457 --> 15:10.457
- I don't believe that.
- Just forget about him.

15:11.677 --> 15:14.211
Kind of like how you forgot about Richie.

15:46.795 --> 15:48.578
Your brother found the best vein.

15:48.714 --> 15:49.913
That's hilarious.

15:50.048 --> 15:52.415
Would you rather he turned you?

15:52.551 --> 15:56.002
[Grunts] No, he can keep
that venom shit to himself.

15:59.808 --> 16:01.508
You found your own venom.

16:05.180 --> 16:06.180
Moron.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.448
Richie: Well, well, well.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.951
Sun goes down, things get busy.

16:28.086 --> 16:29.169
<i>Culebras?</i>

16:29.288 --> 16:30.587
I can't tell.

16:30.672 --> 16:32.789
They got their own Lou Ferrigno.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.507
Their own <i> qué?</i>

16:34.626 --> 16:37.344
That is one big bastard.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.717
He doesn't own you anymore.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.021
You know that, right?

16:48.140 --> 16:51.641
I know this is our first move against them
but we do this job like all the others.

[Heavy footsteps]

33:28.316 --> 33:29.316
Richie.

33:30.701 --> 33:31.701
Richie, get up.

33:32.987 --> 33:35.487
Let's go. It's too cold in here.

33:44.415 --> 33:48.217
[Gunshots]

33:55.559 --> 33:57.393

35:08.416 --> 35:10.966
What the hell happened in there, man?

35:11.085 --> 35:12.251
It's all good.

35:12.386 --> 35:14.086
Get this loaded on the truck.

35:24.899 --> 35:27.376
_

35:27.399 --> 35:29.592
_

35:29.616 --> 35:31.060

35:49.123 --> 35:50.672
It's a beautiful thing.

35:50.791 --> 35:51.791
Yeah.

35:52.793 --> 35:54.176
Hurry it up.

36:01.936 --> 36:03.352
You all right?

36:05.139 --> 36:08.023
He's using trucks to ship
people back to Mexico.

36:08.142 --> 36:09.858
The Twister's closed.

36:09.977 --> 36:11.477
There's a thirst.

36:11.562 --> 36:14.062
That's how we find him.

36:14.148 --> 36:15.814
We follow the flesh.

36:15.900 --> 36:17.900
Follow the flesh?

36:17.985 --> 36:20.369
It'd be better if we had our own.

36:20.488 --> 36:23.071
Where we could track
'em, use 'em as bait.

36:23.157 --> 36:24.656
That's a great plan.

36:32.550 --> 36:34.630
If you don't like it I can
get you a different style.

36:34.668 --> 36:35.668
Richard...

36:37.388 --> 36:41.340
I can give you what you
want, but not what you need.

36:43.010 --> 36:44.560
Not until I'm finished with them.

36:50.935 --> 36:52.518
Jimmy: Sorry to interrupt.

36:53.521 --> 36:54.853
This gig was nice.

36:54.939 --> 36:58.190
So nice, it's gonna pay me twice.

36:58.325 --> 37:00.075
How you figure?

37:01.912 --> 37:03.111
Security tapes.

37:03.197 --> 37:05.113
We never shut down the cameras.

37:05.199 --> 37:08.250
We've got footage of you
two robbing the place.

37:08.369 --> 37:09.868
You didn't watch the tape?

37:10.004 --> 37:12.671
Don't need to. We heard the shots.

37:12.756 --> 37:14.923
So, we're not only getting the loot,

37:15.042 --> 37:17.960
we're getting a reward for information

37:18.045 --> 37:20.879
leading to the apprehension
of Richard Gecko.

37:20.965 --> 37:23.465
Well, in this case, his dead body,

37:23.551 --> 37:24.933
which was found

37:25.052 --> 37:28.437
right next to that of his
smoking hot beaner girlfriend.

37:28.556 --> 37:32.140
Baby,<i> tengo hambre.</i>

37:32.226 --> 37:34.059
Just one bite.

37:34.144 --> 37:35.561
Really?

37:35.646 --> 37:37.229
They've got to last us.

37:40.568 --> 37:42.234
Holy fuckin'...!

37:50.800 --> 37:52.850
Can't believe I missed it.

37:52.969 --> 37:56.721
Goddamn security tapes. It's the
one thing I should have been on.

37:56.806 --> 37:59.140
See? All that thinking for nothing.

37:59.276 --> 38:01.025
No, I should have done more.

38:01.144 --> 38:03.728
Can you imagine if this had gotten out?

38:03.813 --> 38:06.814
Every lawman's still
looking for the Geckos.

38:06.950 --> 38:08.900
Then we make them stop looking.

38:10.654 --> 38:12.987
If we are gonna fight this war,

38:13.123 --> 38:15.573
we have to be stronger.

38:15.659 --> 38:18.459
We have to shed the old skin.

38:31.675 --> 38:33.675
Santanico: <i>However
lost we might feel,</i>

38:33.760 --> 38:36.844
<i>we have to find our
way in the night.</i>

38:40.734 --> 38:45.269
<i>To do that, we have
to disguise ourselves.</i>

38:47.824 --> 38:50.942
<i>Our new face might appear
the same to others,</i>

38:51.027 --> 38:53.194
<i>but something has changed</i>

38:53.279 --> 38:56.664
<i>because it has to change, Richard.</i>

38:59.669 --> 39:01.336
<i>We have to start over.</i>

39:03.757 --> 39:06.591
<i>We have to let go of who we were,</i>

39:06.710 --> 39:08.292
<i>to become who we are.</i>

39:09.379 --> 39:12.046
Malvado: I want you to dance for me.

39:12.132 --> 39:15.350
<i>I want them to see
how beautiful you are,</i>

39:15.435 --> 39:16.551
<i>in every way.</i>

39:16.686 --> 39:18.553
<i>Make them your slaves.</i>

39:18.638 --> 39:20.722
<i>Let them see inside of you.</i>

Santanico.

40:44.390 --> 40:45.773
She's gone?

40:45.859 --> 40:48.276
She was taken. Two brothers.

40:48.361 --> 40:50.278
Some people say it's prophecy.

40:50.363 --> 40:52.897
I say they're already history.

40:55.151 --> 40:56.484
Time to regulate.

40:57.654 --> 40:59.821

- Morning.
- What's going on, brother?

43:48.992 --> 43:52.960
Something you might want to see.
Think you can I.D. these two?
