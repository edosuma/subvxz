(ALARM CLOCK BUZZING)

03:31.909 --> 03:36.579
[JENNA] Uh... tell him I need to
put those ones out back, okay?

03:36.581 --> 03:38.550
[JENNA]
Yeah, out the back, great.

03:43.656 --> 03:45.325
[JENNA]
That one goes upstairs.

03:52.730 --> 03:54.564
(CAR APPROACHING)

03:54.566 --> 03:57.770
(MUFFLED MUSIC PLAYING)

04:02.441 --> 04:03.940
- There she is.
- [JENNA] Hey, babe.

04:03.942 --> 04:08.578
Hey! How's it going? Yeah.

04:08.580 --> 04:10.617
- Exhausted.
- Yeah?

04:13.519 --> 04:15.719
Hey... I'm gonna go say hello
to the neighbor real quick.

04:15.721 --> 04:16.889
Yeah.

04:18.557 --> 04:23.493
Hey! Scott Maravich.

04:23.495 --> 04:25.961
- Mike, Mike Prentiss, hi.
- Hey.

04:25.963 --> 04:28.932
- You're leasing from the Brents?
- We are, yeah.

04:28.934 --> 04:30.867
I tell you, it's hard to find
a decent place...

04:30.869 --> 04:32.536
for a good price around here.

04:32.538 --> 04:34.471
The pool sealed the deal.

04:34.473 --> 04:37.541
Yeah, well, with this weather
lately, it's a good thing.

04:37.543 --> 04:41.545
Hey! Jenna! Come over and meet
Mike, our new neighbor.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.546
- Okay.
- This is exciting.

04:43.548 --> 04:45.748
Welcome.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.683
Nice car you have.

04:47.685 --> 04:52.622
Oh, sure is. You know, I can get
you in one of those babies...

04:52.624 --> 04:54.123
for under $800 a month.

04:54.125 --> 04:56.959
Oh, uh... you sell them?

04:56.961 --> 04:59.562
Stop by sometime, take one
for a test drive.

04:59.564 --> 05:01.565
- No pressure.
- Okay.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.065
- Hi, I'm Jenna.
- Hi.

05:03.067 --> 05:05.538
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Mike.

05:09.007 --> 05:11.408
We should have you over
for a barbecue on Sunday...

05:11.410 --> 05:13.409
a little meet the neighbors.

05:13.411 --> 05:14.810
- Great.
- Yeah, what time?

05:14.812 --> 05:16.646
Well, I'll have to check
with the missus...

05:16.648 --> 05:20.082
but early afternoon will
probably work out.

05:20.084 --> 05:21.918
That sounds great, I'll bring
the beer.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.855
Just call me on that number when
you get a time, it's my cell.

05:24.857 --> 05:26.522
- We should finish unloading.
- Yeah.

05:26.524 --> 05:28.125
These guys charge by the hour.
Nice meeting you.

05:28.127 --> 05:29.425
Nice to meet you.

05:29.427 --> 05:30.629
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:42.708 --> 05:45.578
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

05:46.644 --> 05:49.745
- Hi.
- Hello.

05:49.747 --> 05:51.447
Mm... pasta.

05:51.449 --> 05:55.822
Frozen ravioli, but the tomatoes
are fresh from the garden.

05:59.858 --> 06:01.658
How was your day?

06:01.660 --> 06:04.694
Aw, kids are still in summer
vacation mode.

06:04.696 --> 06:06.529
I have to repeat everything
three times...

06:06.531 --> 06:08.767
and even then, half of them
are somewhere else.

06:11.103 --> 06:13.437
I saw a car in the driveway
next door.

06:13.439 --> 06:15.137
Did the neighbors move in?

06:15.139 --> 06:19.909
Yeah, yeah, a young couple...
I invited them over...

06:19.911 --> 06:23.712
for a meet the neighbors
barbecue on Sunday.

06:23.714 --> 06:29.219
I figured we'd invite the
Getners, and Brian and Marla.

06:29.221 --> 06:33.156
I wished you'd asked me first.

06:33.158 --> 06:35.959
I have essays I have to look
at this weekend.

06:35.961 --> 06:40.930
It's just a barbecue.
I'll handle everything.

06:40.932 --> 06:42.531
I don't see why we have
to be the ones.

06:42.533 --> 06:43.699
I mean, if we're gonna
have a cookout...

06:43.701 --> 06:46.069
I'd rather friends come over.

06:46.071 --> 06:49.839
The Getners bore me to tears.

06:49.841 --> 06:52.209
They invite us to everything,
I can't exactly...

06:52.211 --> 06:53.944
So let them host it.

06:53.946 --> 06:55.745
I'm just trying to be
neighborly...

06:55.747 --> 06:58.548
I'll call them and tell
them it's off.

06:58.550 --> 07:04.086
No, no, no, no, it's fine,
I'm sorry.

07:04.088 --> 07:05.458
Never mind.

07:07.559 --> 07:09.896
I'll go take a shower
before dinner.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.569
[MARLA] No mayonnaise?

07:19.571 --> 07:21.974
One test drive...

07:23.774 --> 07:27.077
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

07:27.079 --> 07:28.945
All right, you're at an
amusement park...

07:28.947 --> 07:30.747
and you're on that roller
coaster, and just about to go...

07:30.749 --> 07:32.916
into descent, you know,
and it's a jolt of speed...

07:32.918 --> 07:35.151
that adrenaline, that's a
freakin' Corvette, Brian.

07:35.153 --> 07:37.286
- You say about 190 miles an hour?
- Maybe.

07:37.288 --> 07:39.788
You know, where am I gonna drive
a car 190 miles an hour?

07:39.790 --> 07:41.658
Anywhere you want, Brian.

07:41.660 --> 07:44.793
That... that fucking cockpit is
built for like a chimpanzee...

07:44.795 --> 07:46.195
or something like that.

07:46.197 --> 07:47.998
A guy like my size, I don't fit
in that fucker.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.598
You'd be surprised.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.567
Like, don't tell me you
never wanted a Corvette?

07:51.569 --> 07:53.202
- Ah...
- Take a test drive, then tell me.

07:53.204 --> 07:55.971
You know, Corvettes are kind
of for guys with small dicks.

07:55.973 --> 07:57.841
- You know? No offense.
- Oh, yeah?

07:57.843 --> 08:01.777
What did Paxton say? "If you're
in a 'Vette, girls are wet."

08:01.779 --> 08:03.812
Who the fuck is Paxton?

08:03.814 --> 08:07.884
True Lies, man. Tom Arnold,
Schwarz...

08:07.886 --> 08:09.885
- Hey, babe!
- Yeah.

08:09.887 --> 08:11.721
[SCOTT] Can you see if our
burgers are ready?

08:11.723 --> 08:13.022
Yeah, sure.

08:13.024 --> 08:15.959
I love you. She's so sweet.

08:15.961 --> 08:17.993
I love wives.

08:17.995 --> 08:20.630
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:20.632 --> 08:21.731
How's it going?

08:21.733 --> 08:23.098
Oh, good, what can I get
for you?

08:23.100 --> 08:26.168
Ah, Scott likes his rare.

08:26.170 --> 08:28.938
Um, rare coming up.

08:28.940 --> 08:31.774
- This one right... right there.
- Great.

08:31.776 --> 08:33.010
Thank you.

08:36.347 --> 08:38.914
How long have you been married?

08:38.917 --> 08:40.816
Oh, just four months, actually.

08:40.818 --> 08:43.822
But we were together a long time
before that.

08:46.692 --> 08:52.027
Hey, I actually noticed that
you're really into gardening.

08:52.029 --> 08:55.765
Yeah, it's sort of a hobby,
it gets me out of the house.

08:55.767 --> 08:57.334
Right.

08:57.336 --> 08:59.201
- Do you garden?
- No, no.

08:59.203 --> 09:02.137
You know, I'd like to,
but I've never really been...

09:02.139 --> 09:04.143
in one place long enough
to pick it up.

09:06.177 --> 09:08.677
Hey, what do you do, Mike?

09:08.679 --> 09:12.616
I'm a technical writer.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.618
Don't ask, it's as boring
as it sounds.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.653
But I get to work from home
and set my own hours.

09:17.655 --> 09:19.224
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

09:22.027 --> 09:24.761
Hey, would it be weird
if I asked you to come over...

09:24.763 --> 09:26.396
and take a look at my back yard?

09:26.398 --> 09:29.398
It's a mess, and I don't know
what to pull out...

09:29.400 --> 09:33.837
or what to plant, and...
I'd appreciate it.

09:33.839 --> 09:36.039
- Anytime.
- Yeah? That'd be great.

09:36.041 --> 09:37.973
- [SCOTT] Hey, Jenna!
- Yeah?

09:37.975 --> 09:41.111
Don't let those burgers get cold
and don't forget the mustard.

09:41.113 --> 09:44.013
- Just wait a second.
- [SCOTT] Yellow.

09:44.015 --> 09:45.283
Thanks, Mike.

09:59.664 --> 10:01.698
Well, they seemed nice enough.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.767
Hopefully we didn't bore them
to death.

10:04.769 --> 10:07.837
Good looking couple, too.

10:07.839 --> 10:10.309
They're just young.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.310
Probably rather be hanging out
with people...

10:14.312 --> 10:17.180
their own age, you know.

10:17.182 --> 10:21.117
She seemed a little quiet,
bland even.

10:21.119 --> 10:23.389
That Scott has enough
personality for the two of them.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.758
Didn't you think he was
a bit of a jerk?

10:29.760 --> 10:33.829
Not really, a little forward
maybe...

10:33.831 --> 10:36.968
but I actually thought he was
kind of funny.

10:39.471 --> 10:42.173
Just because you laugh,
it doesn't make you funny.

10:58.889 --> 11:02.427
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

12:49.267 --> 12:51.971
Sweetie, I have to get up
at 6:00.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.883
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

13:56.433 --> 13:58.203
Oh, boy.

14:08.145 --> 14:10.280
[MIKE] Hey, neighbor!

14:10.282 --> 14:12.448
Hey!

14:12.450 --> 14:14.416
I don't think anyone's done
anything...

14:14.418 --> 14:17.322
with that garden in, oh,
ten years.

14:19.157 --> 14:22.425
It looks it, right?

14:22.427 --> 14:26.296
Oh, I don't know if I'm ready
for a project this big.

14:26.298 --> 14:30.369
You'd be amazed at how quickly
you can get that into shape.

14:32.703 --> 14:36.274
Want to come over here and
give me some pointers?

14:42.547 --> 14:44.980
Once you pull out all the weeds
and the grasses...

14:44.982 --> 14:47.950
and then you'll be able to see
exactly what you have.

14:47.952 --> 14:49.252
Uh-huh.

14:49.254 --> 14:51.353
I mean like these lilacs here...

14:51.355 --> 14:54.723
they're beautiful,
but it's completely overgrown.

14:54.725 --> 14:56.425
Yeah, it looks it, right?

14:56.427 --> 14:59.262
You know, you could divide them
up and replant them...

14:59.264 --> 15:03.065
in different places in the yard,
spread them out a little bit.

15:03.067 --> 15:06.401
But I was actually thinking
about an herb garden... maybe.

15:06.403 --> 15:09.705
Sure, sure, you could mix them
in with some draught-tolerant...

15:09.707 --> 15:13.209
natives, and that way you won't
have to water them that much.

15:13.211 --> 15:15.111
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:15.113 --> 15:16.713
Huh.

15:16.715 --> 15:19.449
Hey, well do you think maybe you
could help me pick out a couple?

15:19.451 --> 15:25.088
No, I'm a busy guy, I'm sorry.
Yes, of course, I can.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.959
Thank you. I appreciate it.

15:31.763 --> 15:34.998
So do you have any kids?

15:35.000 --> 15:39.167
I only ask, because I saw some
photos in your house, and...

15:39.169 --> 15:42.238
Yes, I have a son, his name
is Alex.

15:42.240 --> 15:46.376
- Alex.
- Alex.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.180
He's probably about your age.

15:51.482 --> 15:54.449
That's beautiful, that's
beautiful.

15:54.451 --> 15:57.255
[MIKE]
That's a nice plumbago.

15:58.355 --> 16:00.455
Scott wants kids...

16:00.457 --> 16:05.294
but I, uh, I think I'd like to
work a little first, you know.

16:05.296 --> 16:08.664
He says, "What's the point
in having a career...

16:08.666 --> 16:11.767
"if you just have to quit
to raise the children?"

16:11.769 --> 16:13.169
So...

16:13.171 --> 16:14.804
You could do both.

16:14.806 --> 16:16.472
[JENNA] Yeah.

16:16.474 --> 16:18.473
You could figure out something
to do from home.

16:18.475 --> 16:21.276
I mean, if that's what you
wanted.

16:21.278 --> 16:25.614
Yeah, I don't know.

16:25.616 --> 16:29.484
I was studying dance when
I first met Scott...

16:29.486 --> 16:31.753
but you know, it's not like you
can really make a career...

16:31.755 --> 16:33.725
out of that, so...

16:35.326 --> 16:37.259
Well, I can tell you from
experience...

16:37.261 --> 16:40.128
that even if you think you
know what you want...

16:40.130 --> 16:42.765
it's often times not what
you really want.

16:42.767 --> 16:47.236
And usually, we end up
settling for less.

16:47.238 --> 16:48.570
All right, now you're gonna
depress me.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.138
I know, it's depressing,
isn't it?

16:50.140 --> 16:51.807
- Yes, it is.
- I'm sorry. I'm a realist.

16:51.809 --> 16:54.310
It's a fatal flaw, don't
listen to me.

16:54.312 --> 16:56.145
I won't.

16:56.147 --> 17:00.483
I'll limit myself to keeping up
that facade of blissful...

17:00.485 --> 17:05.654
contentedness, and just dole out
sage gardening tips.

17:05.656 --> 17:07.489
- Does that work?
- Yeah, that sounds a lot better.

17:07.491 --> 17:09.461
[MIKE] Okay.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.865
I should probably get back
to work.

17:16.867 --> 17:19.069
- Right.
- Yeah.

17:20.805 --> 17:23.338
That's the one problem with
making your own hours...

17:23.339 --> 17:27.343
it's so easy to start the day...
tomorrow.

17:27.345 --> 17:30.712
- Thanks for your help today.
- You're welcome.

17:30.714 --> 17:33.649
- Hey, Mike!
- Yeah?

17:33.651 --> 17:35.250
You are going to come
to the nursery with me...

17:35.252 --> 17:36.521
when it's time to plant,
right?

17:38.789 --> 17:41.426
Whenever you're ready.

17:54.705 --> 17:57.373
Alex is coming home this
weekend.

17:57.375 --> 18:00.409
Here comes the laundry.

18:00.411 --> 18:03.179
- It'd be nice to have him around.
- Mm.

18:03.181 --> 18:06.518
Have you spoken to him lately?

18:09.487 --> 18:10.756
A couple of weeks ago.

18:14.659 --> 18:18.161
I don't know about this new
principal.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.595
She's pushing these review
guidelines with no input...

18:20.597 --> 18:22.331
and there are teachers who have
been there for 20 years...

18:22.333 --> 18:24.933
and they know what does
and doesn't work.

18:24.935 --> 18:27.839
It's not like we have that
much flexibility anyway.

18:29.606 --> 18:31.340
You know, I've seen it before,
they come in...

18:31.342 --> 18:35.244
and it's all about making
themselves look good.

18:35.246 --> 18:38.247
What's good for the school and
the students is secondary.

18:38.249 --> 18:42.517
You teach to the test, the test
scores go up, it's no mystery.

18:42.519 --> 18:44.756
Yep.

18:50.228 --> 18:52.163
You're not listening to me.

18:53.330 --> 18:55.730
Sure, I am, yeah.

18:55.732 --> 18:59.535
[LISA] No, you're not.
What did I just say?

18:59.537 --> 19:03.642
You mentioned, uh, the testing,
and, um...

19:05.442 --> 19:09.211
Sorry, this is so boring,
it's just my career.

19:09.213 --> 19:13.516

is not... it's not here.

was about 150 in dog years...

anyway, but Gary panics.

tell everyone the dog ran
away...

37:07.056 --> 37:08.856
have the dog cremated.

for a drink...

37:31.681 --> 37:34.481
he literally stops at a bar
with a dead dog in a suitcase.

37:34.483 --> 37:37.351
And while he's at the bar,
okay?

37:37.353 --> 37:40.322
He goes to take a piss, comes
back, out of the john...

37:40.324 --> 37:41.623
suitcase is gone!

37:41.625 --> 37:42.891
[ALEX] No way.

37:42.893 --> 37:45.760

dead dog!

37:45.762 --> 37:48.762

suitcase with a dead dog...

37:51.702 --> 37:53.668
out of the fucking bar.

37:53.670 --> 37:55.704

a payday...

37:55.706 --> 37:58.606

in a suitcase.

interested in hanging out...

40:14.844 --> 40:16.846
with the neighbors,
than with us.

40:18.648 --> 40:20.081

There's just something
about that guy that I...

I don't think he's that good
for... for her, you know.

I just want Alex to be careful
around him, that's all.

You should let Alex enjoy
himself...

to pry.

But I heard the fight that you
and Scott had the other day.

Oh, um... I'm...
that's embarrassing.

right now...

43:18.762 --> 43:21.896

nothing.

43:25.235 --> 43:27.101
You don't have to explain.

43:27.103 --> 43:32.041
You know he has to uh, watch his
temper when he's been drinking.

43:34.177 --> 43:42.115
Maybe he should stop
drinking.

43:42.117 --> 43:45.722
Thank you for worrying
about me, though... I mean it.

in a grocery bag on the floor,
right at my feet.

the flashlight...

45:47.976 --> 45:50.110
all over the inside of the car.

45:50.112 --> 45:52.313

point...

45:52.315 --> 45:55.115
that Brian has peed himself,
maybe twice.

And, I'm so stoned that I...

45:57.820 --> 46:00.588
I'm positive that I can talk us
out of the situation.

I'm getting there, don't rush me
on this.

46:03.827 --> 46:06.860
- So, we would have, but, so...
- Okay, okay.

46:06.862 --> 46:09.229
- Brian reaches for his wallet.
- Uh-huh.

46:09.231 --> 46:10.965
He's trying to get his I.D.,
but he's so nervous...

46:10.967 --> 46:12.833
he drops the wallet
on the floor.

46:12.835 --> 46:15.101
So, he bends over to pick up the
wallet, and the cop freaks out.

46:15.103 --> 46:17.572
He starts screaming, "Just get
your hands on the dashboard...

46:17.574 --> 46:19.173
"right now, you idiots!"

46:19.175 --> 46:20.941
I remember the "you idiots"
part.

46:20.943 --> 46:22.476
You are idiots.

with at that point.

- No!

of the police car.

46:34.056 --> 46:35.856
- No!
- No...

46:35.858 --> 46:39.559
Drives it, then he backs up, and
he takes off down the highway.

46:39.561 --> 46:42.929
So the cop is standing there and
he's shocked, he's stunned.

46:42.931 --> 46:44.264
- He's looking around, he's like...
- I'm shocked.

46:44.266 --> 46:46.233

46:47.536 --> 46:49.403
and couldn't figure out
what was going on.

46:49.405 --> 46:52.206
So the cop turns, he runs...

46:52.208 --> 46:54.008
and he just runs back
to his car...

46:54.010 --> 46:55.876
he hops in his car and he
takes off.

46:55.878 --> 46:58.246
And the two of us are sitting
there, we stop for a second...

46:58.248 --> 46:59.546
and look at each other like...

46:59.548 --> 47:01.916
"Okay, what the fuck just
happened?"

47:01.918 --> 47:03.483
And then we bust out laughing.

47:03.485 --> 47:05.418
- What? That is insane!
- I know!

47:05.420 --> 47:08.188

47:08.190 --> 47:15.195

it was safer to grow my own.

as some like big, pot smoker.

he's always had a temper.

I mean, he got a little crazy
at first.

50:41.336 --> 50:44.041
When he got mad, it was
still scary.

50:46.108 --> 50:51.644

thought that once we got married...

50:51.646 --> 50:55.485
you know, he'd be happier.

that wanted to get married.

to have kids.

him?

51:43.465 --> 51:44.835

wise idea to have a child...

51:57.480 --> 52:00.583
with anyone, unless you're sure.

52:12.494 --> 52:16.863
I really shouldn't be giving
you advice on this.

52:16.865 --> 52:19.436
No, no, you're right. I mean...

52:22.271 --> 52:28.245
I think this whole thing...
marriage, Scott...

52:30.813 --> 52:32.883
...was a mistake.

something out.

something breaking...

01:03:46.021 --> 01:03:47.354
so I went next door.

[LISA] And?

01:03:49.056 --> 01:03:51.557
And the sliding glass doors,
they were open... so...

01:03:51.559 --> 01:03:54.561
You went inside?

01:03:54.563 --> 01:03:56.896

much as told me that...

01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:03.003
[LISA] Why didn't you tell me?

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:05.070
I didn't want to freak you out.

01:04:05.072 --> 01:04:06.139
If you knew that he was
violent...

01:04:06.141 --> 01:04:08.008
why didn't you call the police?

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.541
I didn't have time to call
the police, because I heard...

01:04:09.543 --> 01:04:11.510
something breaking and then
there was this scream.

01:04:11.512 --> 01:04:13.345
Was she hurt?

01:04:13.347 --> 01:04:17.583
No, no, I don't... I don't think
so. I don't think so.

01:04:17.585 --> 01:04:19.119
[MIKE]
She's afraid of him, Lisa.

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:21.121
Why is she telling you this?

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:23.657
You know what he said?
He said that a lamp broke.

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:25.958
That she tripped over a lamp
and that's what broke.

this happens again...

who said that I could stay
at his place in San Diego.

really there.
