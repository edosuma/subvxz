00:05.175 --> 00:06.754
Chomsky, come here.

00:06.755 --> 00:08.297
Come here, Chomsky.

00:08.298 --> 00:10.209
Abed, I'm really sorry.

00:10.210 --> 00:11.109
I told you cats don't like me.

00:11.110 --> 00:12.929
They consider me a competitor
because of my natural

00:12.930 --> 00:14.309
stealth and ambivalence.

00:14.310 --> 00:17.419
Oh, did she get high again and
forget she doesn't wear contacts?

00:17.420 --> 00:19.439
Before Britta moved her
cats into our apartment,

00:19.440 --> 00:21.839
she wanted to introduce them
to us on neutral ground.

00:23.410 --> 00:25.419
One of them scratched Abed
and ran under the couch.

00:25.420 --> 00:26.469
Oh, I'll get it.

00:26.470 --> 00:26.990
Cats love me.

00:28.090 --> 00:28.684
What? Are you sure?

00:28.685 --> 00:30.595
Mm-hm.

00:30.596 --> 00:33.590
[SOUND] Hello there.

00:33.591 --> 00:35.066
Well, she is.

00:35.067 --> 00:36.539
Is it a he or a she?

00:36.540 --> 00:39.550
He. Well, he's really got his
teeth in my flesh right now.

00:41.580 --> 00:42.388
Okay, he's touching bone.

00:42.389 --> 00:44.849
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:44.850 --> 00:45.919
I'm just waiting for him to finish up.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.270
Not a lot I can do at this point.

00:49.270 --> 00:50.550
This was a pretty big mistake.

00:52.010 --> 00:52.529
Okay.

00:52.530 --> 00:55.949
This is done.

00:55.950 --> 00:57.911
Oh.

00:57.912 --> 00:59.259
See you tomorrow.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.621
I'm pretty embarrassed about this.

01:01.620 --> 01:02.199
Chomsky.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.239
I didn't know Britta was
moving in with Annie and Abed.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.359
That's-. Expository?

01:06.360 --> 01:07.869
Yeah, Britta's fallen on hard times and

01:07.870 --> 01:09.989
our apartment is the cheapest game in town.

01:09.990 --> 01:13.190
Abed, it's a little embarrassing
when you put it that way.

01:14.460 --> 01:16.249
Britta's a rich genius
with super powers and

01:16.250 --> 01:18.779
she's gonna live on our sofa for no reason.

01:18.780 --> 01:19.649
Oh, no.

01:19.650 --> 01:22.149
Dinosaurs. My tax documents.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.157
Facts about Native Americans.

01:23.158 --> 01:25.749
[LAUGH] Just kidding.

01:25.750 --> 01:29.610
Guess what I just purchased for the
school from a local manufacturer,

01:29.611 --> 01:32.758
Greendale's first virtual
reality operating system.

01:32.759 --> 01:33.571
[SOUND].

01:33.572 --> 01:36.857
Did Greendale need a
virtual reality system?

01:36.858 --> 01:38.779
Like a hole in the head.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.829
A hole in the head is something
that you don't need.

01:42.830 --> 01:44.960
She said through a huge hole in her head.

01:46.020 --> 01:47.539
Didn't VR go out in the 90s?

01:47.540 --> 01:50.629
The last people I saw using it
were in the Honeycomb Hideout.

01:50.630 --> 01:52.119
We mock what we don't understand.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.289
We also mock what's silly.

01:53.290 --> 01:55.631
Jeffrey. Abed, you're
more machine than man.

01:55.632 --> 01:57.769
You wanna give me a hand setting
up the equipment after lunch?

01:57.770 --> 02:00.051
We're all going to help Britta
move into our place today.

02:01.720 --> 02:02.319
Jeffrey?

02:02.320 --> 02:04.009
Britta, something's come up.

02:04.010 --> 02:04.559
I'd love to.

02:04.560 --> 02:07.819
Oh, yeah, yeah, at least you don't
have to bust out your usual excuse.

02:07.820 --> 02:10.499
You don't know for sure that I'm not
a veteran, and nobody can say for

02:10.500 --> 02:11.719
sure that today isn't Veteran's Day.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.989
Hi. I got bit by a cat.

02:14.990 --> 02:15.590
Chang, we know.

02:16.810 --> 02:19.489
Why are you guys and all these

Dean, where did you get this, and
for how much of the school's money?

02:55.350 --> 02:57.181
Relax, my little bean countess.

02:57.182 --> 02:58.387
Don't worry about it.

02:58.388 --> 03:00.918
You pay me to worry about that.

03:00.919 --> 03:02.661
Oh, and how much do I pay you?

03:02.662 --> 03:03.543
That's you.

03:03.544 --> 03:06.445
It was only $5000.

03:06.446 --> 03:07.026
What?

03:07.027 --> 03:11.007
Frankie, jack me up.

03:11.008 --> 03:14.408
I would like to see this company's website.

Sure.

03:24.409 --> 03:26.499
Read the instructions, analog man.

03:26.500 --> 03:30.499
When entering virtual reality, you
should calibrate the system by looking

03:30.500 --> 03:33.279
at your own hands, then
turning them over and

03:33.280 --> 03:37.309
looking at the backs of them
with a sense of wonder.

03:37.310 --> 03:38.528

03:49.590 --> 03:52.631
It's incredible.

03:52.632 --> 03:54.210
I can see all around.

03:56.280 --> 04:00.580
I gotta take a closer look at
these structures, they're!

free corn nuts which I feel like have
a small but significant resale value.

It's okay.

05:14.742 --> 05:17.099
Do I do this too? Okay. This is going
to be good for all of us, right?

05:17.100 --> 05:19.090
It's like a fresh start.

Don't worry.

We got a good deal.

05:36.083 --> 05:38.892
Why's my name on here?

05:38.893 --> 05:41.063

05:41.064 --> 05:42.719
And we told the sales guy that.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.179
So. So he put your friend's

It's Portugal's answer to Gremlins
if Gremlins' question was how can

06:02.871 --> 06:04.466
you totally rip us off without
spending any money and

06:04.467 --> 06:05.455
having watched us maybe twice?

Now you just have to print that file out.

You can do that by dragging it to the

All right.

10:52.055 --> 10:54.659
I'll go see if I can get
the school's money back.

10:54.660 --> 10:56.650
You keep White Morpheus inside the matrix.

10:59.890 --> 11:00.839
Jeff.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.179
Britta. You look distraught.

11:02.180 --> 11:04.979
You have ten seconds to tell me
it's not about stupid politics.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.309
I just found out that Annie and

11:06.310 --> 11:08.229
Abed have been cheating
on me with my parents.

11:08.230 --> 11:11.679
They've been sabotaging my life from
the shadows by paying off my debts and

11:11.680 --> 11:12.739
buying me things.

11:12.740 --> 11:13.259
Thank God.

11:13.260 --> 11:14.399
What are you?

11:14.400 --> 11:15.109
Thank God?

11:15.110 --> 11:16.949
The charade can finally end.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.969
Now you know everything
you thought you owed us,

11:18.970 --> 11:20.759
you can actually just
owe to Deb and George.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.059
Deb and George?

11:22.060 --> 11:24.309
You know my parents too?

11:24.310 --> 11:25.269
Since when?

11:25.270 --> 11:27.759
I don't know, since
thousands of dollars ago?

11:27.760 --> 11:28.549
I'm bad with dates.

11:28.550 --> 11:31.709
I remember the New Year's
glasses having zeros for eyes.

11:31.710 --> 11:33.119
And when did Stella get her groove back?

11:33.120 --> 11:35.459
You've all been lying to me for years.

11:35.460 --> 11:37.169
What kind of friends are you?

11:37.170 --> 11:37.839
Poor.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.239
We're poor friends.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.109
And you mooch off us
because you're too proud

11:41.110 --> 11:42.629
to use your own support system.

11:42.630 --> 11:44.699
What kind of friend are you?

11:44.700 --> 11:47.689
And having met them, what
were you rebelling against?

11:47.690 --> 11:50.549
Was it generosity,
whimsical game nights, or

11:50.550 --> 11:52.999
delicious lobster bacon mashed potatoes?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.819
You ate the potatoes?

11:54.820 --> 11:55.999
You, you don't even eat carbs.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.449
I eat love, Britta.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.010
Hot, delicious love that you were
willing to wipe your ass with.

12:00.780 --> 12:01.280
Oh, my God.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.749
I have no friends.

12:04.750 --> 12:06.229
Can we not be so dramatic about this?

12:06.230 --> 12:08.710
There are people in this
world with serious problems.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.180
Chang, go see the nurse!

12:15.150 --> 12:15.700
I'm trying.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here

12:28.680 --> 12:29.579
Yeah? Elroy Ptasnik?

12:29.580 --> 12:32.489
Who's asking? Well, that's always a yes.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.049
Nobody ever says, who's
asking, to the wrong name.

12:34.050 --> 12:35.779
They just say, that's not my name.

12:35.780 --> 12:39.149
When my phone rings and I say hello,
and they say, is Pablo there?

12:39.150 --> 12:42.179
I don't say, who's asking,
I say, wrong number.

12:42.180 --> 12:43.999
You're a clever young man.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.117
I'm 40. Come in.

12:45.118 --> 12:49.946
[SOUND] So?

12:49.947 --> 12:54.739
You sold a Virtu Good 6500 to Craig
Pelton at Greendale Community College,

12:54.740 --> 12:56.250
and we need to return it.

12:57.260 --> 12:58.269
I'll need the serial number.

12:58.270 --> 13:00.551
He deleted the serial number
because he loves the system.

13:01.650 --> 13:02.529
So what's the problem?

13:02.530 --> 13:05.889
The problem is in order to copy a file,
you have to throw a fireball at it,

13:05.890 --> 13:09.499
then absorb the fire, then drop the
flaming file into a crystal lake,

13:09.500 --> 13:12.189
then take out both copies and throw
them into the side of a mountain.

13:12.190 --> 13:13.030
Worlds within worlds.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.519
That doesn't mean anything.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.619
I can copy a file by holding
my finger down on a phone.

13:17.620 --> 13:18.639
Well, so can a monkey.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.460
Now, you're describing
a system for animals.

13:22.110 --> 13:24.880
Terrestrial slobs bound to the
earth by their meaty feet.

13:26.100 --> 13:28.619
I designed a system for gods.

13:28.620 --> 13:29.349
Oh, come on.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.309
You know what you've done.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.949
You know how lame virtual reality is.

13:32.950 --> 13:35.319
You know the damage it
caused mid-90s cinema.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.989
I mean, Michael Douglas walking
around like a jackass,

13:37.990 --> 13:40.279
moving files with a magic glove?

13:40.280 --> 13:40.949
Lawnmower Man?

13:40.950 --> 13:42.389
Did you see Lawnmower Man?

13:42.390 --> 13:44.879
You bet your sweet ass I saw Lawnmower Man.

13:44.880 --> 13:45.929
I consulted on it.

13:45.930 --> 13:47.479
Took Brigitte Nielsen to the premiere.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.429
We were building worlds within worlds.

13:49.430 --> 13:52.519
And now you're living in homes within
campers within parking lots, and

13:52.520 --> 13:56.429
using an iPad to clearly design what
looks like a ripoff of Angry Birds.

13:56.430 --> 13:56.930
Get out.

13:58.540 --> 13:59.109
Get out of my Winnebago!

13:59.110 --> 14:02.259
You're not allowed to say
that like it's a punishment.

14:02.260 --> 14:05.079
I know what it's like to
lie for a living, Elroy!

14:05.080 --> 14:07.430
And you should know, it
feels better to stop.

14:09.930 --> 14:15.641
And my feet aren't meaty!

14:15.642 --> 14:24.360
[SOUND].

14:24.361 --> 14:26.685
[LAUGH]. Britta, honey.

14:26.686 --> 14:27.822
An unexpected treat.

14:27.823 --> 14:31.171
This is a check for all the dirty
money you have used to control and

14:31.172 --> 14:32.857
monitor me without my consent.

14:32.858 --> 14:34.158
But we're not gonna cash this.

14:34.159 --> 14:34.808
Well you can't.

14:34.809 --> 14:36.108
I postdated it a year.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.111
And in that year, I'm gonna get a new job,

14:39.112 --> 14:43.969
new friends, in a new city where you
and your spies can never find me.

14:43.970 --> 14:44.599
Oh, please.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.839
Don't do this.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.231
What choice do you leave me?

14:47.232 --> 14:51.179
Who acts this dishonestly
towards their own daughter?

14:51.180 --> 14:52.711
What choice do you leave us?

14:52.712 --> 14:56.310
I mean, every time we get
too close, you run off.

14:56.311 --> 14:59.087
We sent you a birthday card to
your apartment in New York, and

14:59.088 --> 15:02.038
then next week you're setting fire
to a Jamba Juice in San Jose.

15:02.039 --> 15:04.099
How long is that gonna stick with me?

15:04.100 --> 15:07.135
Until arson is legal, sweetie,
but your father's point is,

15:07.136 --> 15:10.185
we've arrived at the closest
relationship you can tolerate.

15:10.186 --> 15:10.731
Mm-hm.

15:10.732 --> 15:15.111
We've learned, after a decade,
how to love and admire and

15:15.112 --> 15:20.294
finance you from afar, through your
friends, and the social media.

15:20.295 --> 15:21.913
The Tinder and the like.

15:21.914 --> 15:23.819
It's called Tumblr, dad.

15:23.820 --> 15:24.959
No, I mean Tinder.

15:24.960 --> 15:29.110
It's a matchmaking app, and by
the way, if you were on Tinder-.

15:29.111 --> 15:32.009
[LAUGH] Your mom and I think
you'd be the prettiest.

15:32.010 --> 15:35.769
Absolutely, the boys
would be swiping right.

15:35.770 --> 15:36.549
Or girls! Yes!

15:36.550 --> 15:37.999
Whatever makes you happy.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.149
Totally.

15:39.150 --> 15:40.819
What has happened to you two?

15:40.820 --> 15:45.349
Who are these doddering
open-minded geezers?

15:45.350 --> 15:47.999
Where are the people who wouldn't
let me dress up like Prince for

15:48.000 --> 15:48.679
Halloween?

15:48.680 --> 15:52.709
Or told me that the cat ran
away because I tried alcohol?

15:52.710 --> 15:57.399
Or had me drug tested when I
was 11 because they said I was

15:57.400 --> 15:59.075
laughing too much?

15:59.076 --> 16:02.862
We are definitely sorry
about all of that stuff.

16:02.863 --> 16:05.497
Quite frankly, we don't
remember that stuff.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.634
Oh, it's true.

16:07.635 --> 16:09.323
[LAUGH] Woodstock, oh!

16:09.324 --> 16:10.116
Oh, my god.

16:10.117 --> 16:11.837
[CROSSTALK]. I remember Woodstock!

16:11.838 --> 16:14.860
Woodstock was amazing [CROSSTALK] but

16:14.861 --> 16:19.248
you have to realize, Britta,
that your Woodstock,

16:19.249 --> 16:24.239
which was us being bad parents,
that has more to do with you.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.399
So that's what you remember, see?

16:26.400 --> 16:28.942
Mm-hm.

16:28.943 --> 16:30.602
Where are they?

16:30.603 --> 16:31.601
Hm. I'm sorry.

16:31.602 --> 16:34.906
Get out here!

16:34.907 --> 16:37.274
Britta, let me explain.

16:37.275 --> 16:41.449
We were worried about you,
so we just came over.

16:41.450 --> 16:45.169
You can explain to each other in hell.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.809
Friends don't visit each other's parents.

16:48.810 --> 16:52.502
I hope you have a wonderful life.

16:52.503 --> 17:00.455
[SOUND].

17:00.456 --> 17:03.393
Oh.

17:03.394 --> 17:04.426
George, George, yes.

17:04.428 --> 17:07.118
Britta, at least take some
money and fix your car!

17:07.119 --> 17:08.259
Or at least get a cab, or

17:08.260 --> 17:10.598
there are apps we can call
where strangers pick you up.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.179
I don't want your help.

17:12.180 --> 17:13.957
Stop infantilizing me!

17:13.958 --> 17:15.306
Hey, stop.

17:15.307 --> 17:16.035
Stop!

17:16.036 --> 17:17.898
Get out of here.

17:17.900 --> 17:18.608
Hey!

17:18.608 --> 17:22.867
[NOISE].

17:22.868 --> 17:24.446
Green Machine, nice.

17:24.448 --> 17:27.189
Here, Greg, here, take some cash.

17:27.190 --> 17:29.128
Holy crap!

17:29.129 --> 17:31.380
What's her problem?

17:31.381 --> 17:32.711
She's growing up.

17:32.712 --> 17:38.795
[MUSIC]

17:38.796 --> 17:44.676
[SOUND] Oh my god.

17:44.677 --> 17:47.555
I put a tilde on this n!

17:47.556 --> 17:51.096
I can do anything.

17:51.097 --> 17:53.313
[LAUGH].

17:53.314 --> 17:55.403
Any luck?

17:55.404 --> 17:59.200
Ugh, I'm going home.

17:59.201 --> 18:04.445
Oh, and to warn you, he joked about
wanting a pee jar earlier and

18:04.446 --> 18:07.861
it's gradually becoming less of a joke.

18:07.862 --> 18:09.335
Hey, Dean.

18:09.336 --> 18:11.495
I'm coming over and I'm
pulling you out of there.

18:11.496 --> 18:12.087
I'll bite you.

18:12.088 --> 18:12.702
I'll beat you up.

18:12.703 --> 18:15.616
I'll like it and then I'll fire you
and then I'll get right back in it.

18:15.617 --> 18:16.916
I'll still get to beat you up.

18:16.917 --> 18:17.417
Hold it.

18:17.418 --> 18:19.923
Hold it.

18:19.924 --> 18:20.875
Who is that?

18:20.876 --> 18:22.378
I recognize that baritone voice and

18:22.379 --> 18:24.414
the scent of Tic Tacs with
a tinge of Naugahyde.

18:24.415 --> 18:27.723
It's Elroy Patashnik.

18:27.724 --> 18:29.619
The architect.

18:29.620 --> 18:32.540
Listen, I've come to tell you something
very important about this system.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.731
It's lame.

18:36.732 --> 18:38.403
What?

18:38.404 --> 18:42.533
I wasted your time with it and 10
crucial years of America's time.

18:42.534 --> 18:44.391
I'm giving Mr. Williams your refund.

18:44.392 --> 18:45.656
I don't want a refund.

18:45.657 --> 18:51.452
I wanna stay in here forever
and you can't stop me.

18:51.453 --> 18:52.996

18:57.292 --> 18:59.172
How long has he been in there?

18:59.173 --> 19:00.507
Four hours.

19:00.508 --> 19:04.166
Oh, I was thinking weeks.

19:04.167 --> 19:07.849
Ha. Yep!

19:07.850 --> 19:11.681
This guy runs your school?

[SOUND] To use a phrase I coined
in the 90s, [SOUND] I'm going in.

19:18.567 --> 19:19.610
You coined that?

Oh yeah, lock and load.

19:23.526 --> 19:25.824
That's mine too.

I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

19:36.793 --> 19:38.534
What are you doing in my car?

19:38.535 --> 19:41.088
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

19:41.089 --> 19:42.780
No where else but my car?

19:42.781 --> 19:50.326
Do you know how big the planet is?

19:50.327 --> 19:53.948
What is going on, Britta?

19:53.949 --> 19:56.452
My friends, they all think
my parents are adorable, and

19:56.453 --> 19:58.746
they think that I'm the bad
guy for hating them, but

19:58.747 --> 20:01.999
I have a right to hate them, cuz I
had to be there when they sucked.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.459
Yeah.

20:03.460 --> 20:04.419
Jimmy Fallon syndrome.

20:04.420 --> 20:05.869
I get it.

20:05.870 --> 20:07.699
I had that with my parents, too.

20:07.700 --> 20:08.350
You did? Yeah.

20:09.880 --> 20:14.639
You know, one of the most unfair
lessons we're forced to learn

20:14.640 --> 20:17.199
is that our parents are human beings.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.799
We wanna think of them as gods or

20:18.800 --> 20:21.519
demons, because then that
would make us heroes.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.879
But give me a break.

20:23.880 --> 20:24.680
We all suck.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.551
What can I do to help you tonight, Brita?

20:55.711 --> 20:57.800
Yes, more than anything.

Should I order dinner, cuz a lot of
good delivery places are closing?

less real we want it.

21:06.820 --> 21:08.309
I just wanna be a good dean.

21:08.310 --> 21:12.149
I can give you a device
that will accomplish that.

21:12.150 --> 21:13.299
Oh!

21:13.300 --> 21:15.961
You can use this to manipulate worlds.

Here's your power.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.323
Yeah.

21:38.324 --> 21:42.735
Now, manipulate worlds.

21:42.736 --> 21:45.103
Yeah.

Brita, we were so worried.

What happened to the kids Green Machine?

22:09.972 --> 22:10.691
What?

22:10.692 --> 22:11.629
I, I don't know.

22:11.630 --> 22:12.289
I ditched it.

22:12.290 --> 22:13.929
Where and how long ago?

22:13.930 --> 22:15.739
Okay, assume that's not
what's important here.

22:15.740 --> 22:16.959
Brita, we-.

22:16.960 --> 22:17.509
It's okay, Dad.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.719
I have something that I wanna say.

22:19.720 --> 22:23.065
I ran away from home at 17
to become an adult, but

22:23.066 --> 22:26.651
maybe all that did was leave
a part of me stuck at 17,

22:26.652 --> 22:31.135
the part that tends to run away when
I am confronted with the truth.

22:31.136 --> 22:32.552
The truth is good, Brita.

22:32.553 --> 22:33.713
Mom, shut up!

22:33.714 --> 22:35.249
Frankie taught me something important.

22:35.250 --> 22:39.929
It doesn't matter how mature we
are or what resentments we carry.

22:39.930 --> 22:45.944
All that matters is that
we're all going to die.

22:45.945 --> 22:50.402
You have a lovely home.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.029
Thank you.

22:51.030 --> 22:52.859
So, we're really getting our daughter back?

22:52.860 --> 22:54.669
Yeah, but it's not gonna
be that big of a deal.

22:54.670 --> 22:56.179
I mean, you guys missed the good years.

22:56.180 --> 22:58.099
Now, it's just gonna be
margaritas, Pottery Barn,

22:58.100 --> 23:01.969
fighting our family's tendency toward
obesity as we slide into oblivion.

23:01.970 --> 23:04.549
First you guys, and then
me quickly thereafter.

23:04.550 --> 23:05.620
Well, I'll drink to that.

23:05.621 --> 23:12.517
Oh, Abed.

23:12.518 --> 23:13.770
Benjamin.

23:13.771 --> 23:15.883
I got bit by a cat, Deb.

23:15.884 --> 23:18.205
No!

23:18.206 --> 23:21.920
I'll get the antibiotics.

23:21.921 --> 23:24.126
Thank you for the refund, Elroy.

23:24.127 --> 23:25.366
No, thank you for

23:25.367 --> 23:29.519
one last taste of what it was
like when my work was valuable.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.379
Oh, it's still valuable.

23:31.380 --> 23:38.062
Here, $500 for the taste
I got of being powerful.

23:38.063 --> 23:41.220
[BLANK_AUDIO]

23:41.221 --> 23:43.333
Dean, the school can't afford 500-.

23:43.334 --> 23:47.071
Wait for it.

23:47.072 --> 23:49.602
I have no idea what to do
with the rest of my life now.

23:49.603 --> 23:55.778
We offer a wide variety of classes.

23:55.779 --> 23:58.580
And that, my friend, is
the Greendale effect.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.090
I'll never get out of here, will I?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.354
I haven't met many that do.

[LAUGH] Let's walk arm in arm. [MUSIC]

24:09.538 --> 24:13.903
There are times when change
needs to be different,

24:13.904 --> 24:17.873
then there's changes
that are more the same.

24:17.874 --> 24:22.589
But the same changes don't tend to be
different than the changes that came

24:22.590 --> 24:23.206
before.

24:23.207 --> 24:26.313
If you change everything that's different,

24:26.314 --> 24:29.986
sometimes you find out
everything's still the same.

24:29.987 --> 24:37.974
As for me, I'm just changing
everything that's different.

24:37.975 --> 24:40.458
