But he put his knife
to my stomach

31:28.277 --> 31:30.845

31:30.932 --> 31:33.674
The same mark
that was on his logs.

31:33.761 --> 31:36.068

would know I was his.

31:50.734 --> 31:53.433

31:53.520 --> 31:55.609
And that'’s why I came here.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.987
and lance the wicked boil
of jealousy

33:09.074 --> 33:11.598
and come to an arrangement
that is suitable for us all.

33:11.685 --> 33:12.773
There will be no arrangement.

33:12.860 --> 33:15.428
In time, there must be.

33:15.515 --> 33:18.126
You have brought your child
bride to our Doma.

33:19.867 --> 33:21.347
I'’m leaving this place.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.915
You'’re leaving to where?

33:25.003 --> 33:27.440
-Wobik, the Wyandot.
I don'’t know.
-And do what?

33:29.181 --> 33:32.097
Before you came here,
you were welcome nowhere.

33:32.184 --> 33:34.621
Do not take one step
outside my Doma

33:34.708 --> 33:37.624
unless you wish to feel
the gloom of your former path.

33:37.711 --> 33:40.801
Before I took you in and put
clothes on your back

33:40.888 --> 33:42.629
and shared my Doma with you

33:42.716 --> 33:45.371
and lent you the seed
that bore my son.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.286
You are here in this place
because of me.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.331
Never forget that.

33:49.418 --> 33:50.985
He is our son.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.640
Yes, and the only one it seems

33:53.727 --> 33:56.947
you are able to bring
into this world for me.

33:57.035 --> 34:00.212
And Theo favors your wild heart

34:00.299 --> 34:03.650
and will slink back into the
woods the first chance he gets.

34:05.652 --> 34:09.134
Your child bride will bear you
no children, either.

34:09.221 --> 34:12.354
BOUCHARD:
Bonjour, Monsieur Trepagny.

34:12.441 --> 34:14.574
TREPAGNY:
Captain.

34:14.661 --> 34:17.751
If you have come to lay
some peace on my Doma,

34:17.838 --> 34:19.970
you have indeed arrived
at the crucial moment.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.537
All is in disarray.

34:22.799 --> 34:25.802
It'’s not that, I can assure you.

34:29.023 --> 34:32.548
We need your help,
Monsieur Trepagny.

34:32.635 --> 34:35.725
The Iroquois have
taken Father Gabriel.

34:38.554 --> 34:42.515
And how is that my problem?

34:51.741 --> 34:55.441
Yes. Yes, I saw
the tree of dead Indians.

34:55.528 --> 34:58.444
I knew the bill would
come due for Wobik.

34:58.531 --> 35:01.577
It'’s the only way
to deal with the savages.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.362
Then why do you need me?

35:03.449 --> 35:07.017
Go forth and slaughter
and hide behind your walls,

35:07.105 --> 35:09.411
but do not enjoin me
in your fool'’s mission.

35:09.498 --> 35:12.022
I don'’t care
what happens to Wobik.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.329
And what of Father Gabriel?

35:14.416 --> 35:16.114
Another martyr.

35:16.201 --> 35:18.768
The cost of collecting souls,
I suppose.

35:18.855 --> 35:20.553
I will pray for him, Father.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.207
I have problems of my own.

35:22.294 --> 35:25.210
There is the matter
of a proper ceremony

35:25.297 --> 35:28.561
for my beautiful new bride
Melissande.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.780
And my man Rene Sel
has, uh, run off

35:30.867 --> 35:34.175
when I was in town
securing my new bride.

35:34.262 --> 35:35.611
Perhaps you overtasked him.

35:35.698 --> 35:37.657
-Hmm.
-This Doma seems to eat men.

35:37.744 --> 35:40.660
He is not the sort of man
to shy from work.

35:42.314 --> 35:44.968
Intendant De Fer himself
has asked that you

35:45.055 --> 35:47.232
-parley with the Wyandot
-[laughs]: Oh,

35:47.319 --> 35:48.842
-to discover the whereabouts
of the Iroquois.
-no, no, no, no, no, no

35:48.929 --> 35:50.148
no!

35:53.020 --> 35:56.545
He asked to convey the matter
of a debt owed to him.

35:56.632 --> 35:58.765
The debt of your Doma.

35:58.852 --> 36:00.854
Ah, yes, the debt.

36:00.941 --> 36:03.378
That toad skull
has a... a talent

36:03.465 --> 36:06.120
for twisting all into debt.

36:06.207 --> 36:09.036
Will you help us or not?

36:13.606 --> 36:16.130
I will take you
to the Wyandot camp

36:16.217 --> 36:18.176
with no promises,

36:18.263 --> 36:21.266
and that will be
the end of my duty.

36:21.353 --> 36:22.571
Thank you.

36:22.658 --> 36:24.965
All right.
We will make haste.

36:25.052 --> 36:27.185
I must return
to manage my affairs

36:27.272 --> 36:29.361
into some semblance of order.

36:29.448 --> 36:30.579
MELISSANDE:
Will we be safe

36:30.666 --> 36:32.146
in your absence?

36:32.233 --> 36:34.017
Yes, of course, ma chérie.

36:34.104 --> 36:37.238
If the Iroquois come,
how will we defend ourselves?

36:37.325 --> 36:39.849
I will leave one of my deputies

36:39.936 --> 36:42.112
to watch over you, Mademoiselle.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.985
I will fetch my weapon
and we will be off.

36:50.425 --> 36:51.731
If you kill that priest,

36:51.818 --> 36:55.213
you'’ll stir up the French.

36:55.300 --> 36:58.607
They'’ll muster soldiers,
send them against your father.

36:58.694 --> 36:59.739
He'’ll be caught out.

36:59.826 --> 37:02.089
I am not my father.

37:02.176 --> 37:03.482
I just want you
to know the tinder

37:03.569 --> 37:05.266
before you set a spark to it.

37:20.803 --> 37:21.935
[grunts]

37:22.022 --> 37:24.154
[pained grunting]

37:27.332 --> 37:28.898
[groaning]

37:42.782 --> 37:44.566
I have never harmed your people.

37:44.653 --> 37:47.047
I could never.

37:47.134 --> 37:48.788
You'’re not even my own man.

37:50.398 --> 37:53.401
Please.
The priest is a servant.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.709
He'’s a servant of God.

37:58.885 --> 38:01.583
And that doesn'’t matter to you.

38:07.502 --> 38:09.591
Then you don'’t matter to me.

38:11.506 --> 38:13.639
[grunting]

38:22.256 --> 38:24.432
YVON:
We have to follow orders,
Hamish.

38:24.519 --> 38:25.738
HAMISH:
You asked me to go to Wobik

38:25.825 --> 38:27.305
to help find your
brother-in-law.

38:27.392 --> 38:30.133
Both of us swore
to the Hudson Bay Company.

38:30.220 --> 38:33.354
I did that because
I owe you one life.

38:33.441 --> 38:34.834
I do not see it that way.

38:34.921 --> 38:37.576
You saved my life, Hamish.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.534
That debt is now squared.

38:39.621 --> 38:42.363
Now we have orders
from our employer.

38:42.450 --> 38:44.887
The company is careful.

38:44.974 --> 38:47.325
Plainly dressed
and quietly spoken.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.892
That is its strength.

38:49.979 --> 38:53.331
It does not act
on brutality alone.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.550
Seems we work for
different companies.

38:55.637 --> 38:58.640
I will not work
with that man Cooke.

38:58.727 --> 39:02.296
You will do as the company
commands, as will I.

39:02.383 --> 39:05.430
I will not be made unclean
in my dealings with Cooke.

39:21.315 --> 39:22.969
It'’s Lafarge'’s boy.

39:34.067 --> 39:36.374
We should take him
back to town.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.724
How will that look
to the French?

39:38.811 --> 39:40.421
The same man who told a story
about the boy'’s father

39:40.508 --> 39:42.597
being run through
by a burnt giant?

39:42.684 --> 39:46.384
Mm. Then let us
find a suitable tree

39:46.471 --> 39:48.734
and put him to rest under it.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.222
[both grunting]

40:05.141 --> 40:07.666
You'’ve done wonderfully
with Renardette.

40:07.753 --> 40:09.755
The inn is her home now.

40:09.842 --> 40:12.148
Isn'’t that right, Renardette?

40:12.235 --> 40:14.629
So, what of Miss Langois'’
marriage

40:14.716 --> 40:16.588
to Pierre Gasquet?

40:16.675 --> 40:19.373
SABRINE:
It did not work out
as we imagined.

40:19.460 --> 40:21.419
I see.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.725
I was hoping that there might
be a place for her

40:23.812 --> 40:25.379
here at the inn.

40:25.466 --> 40:27.555
It is true...

40:27.642 --> 40:30.210
I am shorthanded
since the loss of Francis.

40:30.297 --> 40:32.299
Delphine will earn her keep.

40:32.386 --> 40:34.910
Delphine, come here, child.

40:41.221 --> 40:44.485
[chuckles] There is a surplus
of stray men in Wobik.

40:44.572 --> 40:47.880
I'’m sure there will soon be a
long line of suitors at the inn.

40:47.967 --> 40:49.359
It will be good for business.

40:49.447 --> 40:52.798
Delphine, do you want
to work for me?

40:52.885 --> 40:54.364
Yes.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.845
I would be grateful
for the opportunity.

40:56.932 --> 40:58.325
Good.

40:58.412 --> 41:00.153
We will begin immediately.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.024
There is a goose to be plucked

41:02.111 --> 41:03.069
and bread to be made.

41:03.156 --> 41:05.332
Come, I show you.

41:30.662 --> 41:32.794
It will do for now.

41:32.881 --> 41:36.276
I'’ve not had such a jacket,
ever.

41:36.363 --> 41:38.278
You must wear it as though

41:38.365 --> 41:41.673
you have owned
many such fine things.

41:41.760 --> 41:44.676
Straighten your back so that
you may look men in the eye

41:44.763 --> 41:46.199
until they give way.

41:46.286 --> 41:48.506
You must summon your voice forth
from your balls,

41:48.593 --> 41:50.377
every word sure-footed.

41:50.464 --> 41:53.902
Let them think every handshake
is a sacred pact.

41:53.989 --> 41:57.253
That you are a man
shot through with fairness.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.212
To the core, a square dealer.

41:59.299 --> 42:01.040
I will try.

42:01.127 --> 42:02.737
You will prosper

42:02.824 --> 42:05.653
with little more than
words and a handshake.

42:05.740 --> 42:09.135
I'’m not fit
for the grind of labor.

42:09.222 --> 42:10.789
No.
No, that is the province

42:10.876 --> 42:13.574
of a lower order of man.

42:13.661 --> 42:16.795
The sort this town
welcomes in abundance.

42:16.882 --> 42:18.884
That is where you and I
have an unfair advantage.

42:18.971 --> 42:20.886
We are hawks

42:20.973 --> 42:23.105
in a pen of rabbits.

42:23.192 --> 42:25.499
Do not forget that.

42:25.586 --> 42:27.936
I won'’t.

42:28.023 --> 42:30.373
I will be sure to repay you
for the jacket.

42:30.460 --> 42:33.594
The only outlay that you owe me

42:33.681 --> 42:36.771
is loyalty.

42:36.858 --> 42:38.599
That as I draw you
into my confidence,

42:38.686 --> 42:41.080
you will not question
what is asked of you.

42:42.821 --> 42:44.562
Yes, sir.

42:44.649 --> 42:46.607
Good.

42:48.740 --> 42:52.482
Then find me Randall Cross
if he is to be found.

42:52.570 --> 42:55.094
He has something of mine.

42:55.181 --> 42:57.618
He worked
for the Hudson'’s Bay Company.

42:57.705 --> 42:59.272
That'’s right.

42:59.359 --> 43:01.796
Now I am off
to show Intendant De Fer

43:01.883 --> 43:04.277
that I remain
mercilessly in thrall

43:04.364 --> 43:06.714
to the rabbits of Wobik.

43:17.507 --> 43:20.510
HAMISH:
Lord, watch over this young man.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.644
Forgive him for his trespasses

43:23.731 --> 43:26.255
and receive him
into your good grace.

43:27.474 --> 43:28.606
Young man, you were

43:28.693 --> 43:31.130
an inconvenience in life, and...

43:31.217 --> 43:34.350
you'’ve wasted our time
yet again today.

43:41.314 --> 43:43.708
We will keep no fire for you.

43:43.795 --> 43:45.144
But let the light
of your ancestors

43:45.231 --> 43:48.016
guide you back home to them.

43:48.103 --> 43:50.932
Walk strong and walk well
upon the road

43:51.019 --> 43:53.674
to those that await
your return back to spirit.

43:55.371 --> 43:57.678
Are we done with the words?

43:57.765 --> 44:00.638
On this, yes.

44:00.725 --> 44:03.075
I believe my brother-in-law
yet lives.

44:03.162 --> 44:05.599
I cannot simply
put that aside, Yvon.

44:05.686 --> 44:07.470
But you must.

44:07.557 --> 44:09.385
Whether Cross is dead or alive,
it doesn'’t matter anymore.

44:09.472 --> 44:11.213
You work for the company.

44:11.300 --> 44:13.302
Not if that means consorting
with the likes of Cooke.

44:13.389 --> 44:15.653
I will tell you
there are far worse men

44:15.740 --> 44:18.873
that we shall meet
in the company'’s employ.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.453
TREPAGNY:
My dear friend.

44:33.540 --> 44:35.455
Your man isn'’t here, Trepagny.

44:35.542 --> 44:36.848
He'’s with the Iroquois.

44:36.935 --> 44:40.329
Likely dead.
The fat priest, too.

44:40.416 --> 44:42.810
Are you certain?

44:42.897 --> 44:46.640
He had no business with the
Iroquois, nor they with him.

44:50.296 --> 44:53.821
I was always a friend to you.

44:53.908 --> 44:56.041
That has been the way of things.

44:56.128 --> 44:59.087
Can you help us
retrieve our men?

45:05.180 --> 45:07.139
I don'’t make that decision.

45:08.227 --> 45:10.577
Then take me to her.

45:10.664 --> 45:13.536
Pray my touch with women

45:13.623 --> 45:15.843
has not permanently deserted me.

45:33.208 --> 45:35.080
TEYARONHIÏIO'’:
No.

45:35.167 --> 45:37.647
The priest and your man
are likely dead.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.606
TREPAGNY:
All I ask is for an escort

45:39.693 --> 45:41.608
to show us where they are.

45:41.695 --> 45:44.176
An escort, for dead men?

45:44.263 --> 45:45.568
TREPAGNY:
My great fear

45:45.655 --> 45:47.919
is they are still alive.

45:48.006 --> 45:49.703
And I should risk my warriors?

45:49.790 --> 45:52.184
The Iroquois
will do as they please.

45:52.271 --> 45:54.447
And there is no benefit here
for them. Nor for us.

45:54.534 --> 45:56.623
I have always kept my promise.

45:56.710 --> 45:58.668
For years.

45:58.756 --> 46:01.889
You shield me from them,
I shield you from Wobik.

46:01.976 --> 46:04.587
The trade has been good for you.

46:06.154 --> 46:08.853
The Iroquois will not stop

46:08.940 --> 46:11.856
at a priest
and an indentured man.

46:11.943 --> 46:14.510
I humbly ask your assistance

46:14.597 --> 46:16.338
to recover innocent men

46:16.425 --> 46:19.428
from the roil
of barbarous torture

46:19.515 --> 46:20.995
or, if they have passed,

46:21.082 --> 46:24.694
that I might put them
into a proper grave.

46:24.782 --> 46:26.653
You would do the same.

46:30.657 --> 46:32.006
Delphine.

46:32.093 --> 46:34.052
C'’est bon.

46:36.097 --> 46:39.405
Oh.
The brandy is excellent.

46:39.492 --> 46:42.016
MATHILDE:
Ah. [chuckles]

46:42.103 --> 46:44.279
-It'’s cognac.
-Mmm.

46:44.366 --> 46:47.021
From Charente.
For our most esteemed guests.

46:47.108 --> 46:48.283
Oh.

46:55.160 --> 46:57.031
Hudson'’s Bay men.

46:57.118 --> 46:59.729
And what do they swill?

46:59.817 --> 47:01.079
They drink what I give them.

47:01.166 --> 47:02.776
Though, to their credit,

47:02.863 --> 47:05.997
they did save Renardette
from the savages.

47:06.084 --> 47:09.304
Mm.
The Crown tolerates Englishmen

47:09.391 --> 47:11.002
who know their place.

47:11.089 --> 47:14.440
Oh. I am expert
at keeping men in their place.

47:14.527 --> 47:16.355
Do not test me, Intendant.

47:16.442 --> 47:18.009
[both laugh]

47:23.188 --> 47:25.843
[chatter stops]

47:34.329 --> 47:37.028
[chatter resumes]

47:37.115 --> 47:39.073
Mmm.

47:41.467 --> 47:44.383
Bonsoir, Intendant.

47:44.470 --> 47:45.558
May I sit with you a while,

47:45.645 --> 47:48.604
that I may bend your ear?

47:49.649 --> 47:51.172
Very well.

47:54.219 --> 47:56.699
Do not think we are equals,

47:56.786 --> 47:58.223
Monsieur Cooke.

47:58.310 --> 48:01.791
Of course not.
I merely wish to point out

48:01.879 --> 48:03.750
a number
of our common interests.

48:03.837 --> 48:06.535
No man is above punishment.

48:06.622 --> 48:08.798
-Well, that is true.
-SULZE: We could also
have you let

48:08.886 --> 48:11.627
outside the walls
to trade with the savages.

48:11.714 --> 48:14.979
If you did, Wobik
would be the poorer for it.

48:15.066 --> 48:17.329
-That is plain truth.
-De FER: What is also true

48:17.416 --> 48:20.810
is that you are
a blackhearted merchant.

48:20.898 --> 48:22.638
My barrels...

48:22.725 --> 48:24.945
and the trade they create
built Wobik.

48:25.032 --> 48:28.427
[scoffs]
Have you not prospered at all?

48:28.514 --> 48:30.690
But of course.
I have.

48:30.777 --> 48:33.345
And so may you.

48:35.390 --> 48:37.523
Let'’s eat.

48:37.610 --> 48:39.699
While I contemplate your use.

48:41.396 --> 48:43.007
He was a little one, as they go.

48:43.094 --> 48:45.270
Jumped on my back, cut me up.

48:45.357 --> 48:48.273
He was gone before I had time
to gather my wits.

48:48.360 --> 48:51.102
It was a dirty ambush.

48:51.189 --> 48:53.582
-But I see the world
more clearly now.
-MATHILDE: Ah.

48:53.669 --> 48:55.628
You can run your mouth
in here all you like,

48:55.715 --> 48:58.152
but you will still your hands.

49:01.851 --> 49:04.463
Renardette, more cups.

49:08.380 --> 49:10.121
Bonsoir.

49:10.208 --> 49:13.037
Mr. Goames.

49:13.124 --> 49:15.213
What were the results
of your meeting?

49:15.300 --> 49:17.345
We'’ll be staying on
a bit longer.

49:17.432 --> 49:19.782
The prune tart has ahold of him.

49:19.869 --> 49:22.002
[chuckles]
Flatter on, Mr. Goames.

49:22.089 --> 49:23.482
HAMISH:
It'’s true.

49:23.569 --> 49:25.527
I am partial to it, Mathilde.

49:25.614 --> 49:27.268
[scoffs, chuckles]

49:27.355 --> 49:29.009
Monsieur?

49:29.096 --> 49:31.272
Can I offer you a pour?
Or perhaps the plate

49:31.359 --> 49:34.014
of the evening: the hen?

49:35.494 --> 49:37.496
Monsieur.

49:44.764 --> 49:46.766
Mr. Cross.
