42:20.238 --> 42:23.609
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT INFECTION.
BUT THEY SAY IN A WEEK OR SO
HE SHOULD BE FINE.

42:25.243 --> 42:27.779
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?

42:27.813 --> 42:29.615
TOO MUCH.

42:41.793 --> 42:43.929
HEY.

42:53.438 --> 42:56.975
WHEN THEY CALLED ME
AND TOLD ME HOW YOU WERE,
I GOT SO SCARED.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.779
AND I DID SOMETHING.

43:03.782 --> 43:05.817
WAITING FOR THE RIDE,

43:05.851 --> 43:08.019
I REALIZED I WAS PRAYING.

43:09.254 --> 43:11.957
NOT HANDS CLASPED,
NOT ON MY KNEES,

43:11.990 --> 43:15.093
BUT SOMETHING
OVER AND OVER.

43:16.795 --> 43:18.930
"DON'T LET HIM DIE."

43:20.098 --> 43:23.301
AND THAT'S PRAYER.
RIGHT?

43:23.334 --> 43:26.371
AND IF THAT'S PRAYER,
IT'S GOTTA BE
A KIND OF FAITH.

43:27.706 --> 43:29.808
YOU'RE A LITTLE
BIT AHEAD OF ME
IN THE FAITH DEPARTMENT,

43:29.841 --> 43:32.477
BUT I'M WORKING ON IT.

43:32.510 --> 43:34.780
YOU REALLY GOT ME
WORKING ON IT, BABY.

43:37.649 --> 43:39.985
SHH.

43:40.018 --> 43:42.821
SHH.
JUST GO TO SLEEP.

43:44.890 --> 43:47.225
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

43:48.326 --> 43:50.461
JUST SLEEP.
