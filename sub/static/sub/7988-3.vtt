00:06.256 --> 00:08.007
Where are you going?

00:08.175 --> 00:09.472
I have to go
to the work.

00:09.635 --> 00:13.640
There's a party tonight
in Bloomsbury.

00:13.805 --> 00:19.403
It's an exhibition or a book
or a birthday or something.

00:19.561 --> 00:22.861
I've actually no idea, but
everyone's gonna be there.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.401
I have a business event.

00:28.529 --> 00:32.159
Of course, don't give it
another thought.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.788
You can come with me.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.960
Really?

00:45.128 --> 00:47.130
But I have nothing
to wear.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.675
I think you're fine
just the way you are.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.718

Morning.

Is there any coffee?

01:14.825 --> 01:17.954
They've just bought up
a fresh pot, let me.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.838
They not have coffee where
you spent the night?

01:19.997 --> 01:22.216
Wherever that was.

01:22.374 --> 01:26.049
Violette was just saying
that we still need to decide

01:26.211 --> 01:27.929
on the epitaph for Grandma,

01:28.088 --> 01:30.136
and the funeral director called

01:30.299 --> 01:31.892
to ask if we'd chosen
a memorial stone.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.552
I don't have time
to think about that now.

01:33.719 --> 01:34.811
It's been a week
since the funeral,

01:34.970 --> 01:36.313
you can't run away from this.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.098
I'm not running away
from anything.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.017
Pa, you're out every night,

01:40.183 --> 01:41.730
the gossip columns
are full of stories.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.863
I appreciate your concern,
Violette, but I'm fine.

01:45.022 --> 01:46.569
No, Pa, you're not.

01:46.732 --> 01:49.827
I don't need my children
telling me how I should behave.

Oh, you've heard.

Mmm.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.752
It wasn't my fault.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.255
All I did was tell the truth.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.962
Oh, you never know, it might
all work out for the best.

02:46.124 --> 02:49.128
You did say you were willing
to start at the bottom.

02:49.294 --> 02:52.969
You could speak
to Mrs. Towler.

If she thinks you belong

Now, where's my hat?

03:00.847 --> 03:01.973
You left it upstairs.

03:02.140 --> 03:02.936
Ah.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.444
What's the point of having
a father in management

03:05.602 --> 03:07.900
if he isn't willing to indulge
in a bit of favoritism?

03:08.063 --> 03:10.816
You see that's the problem
with the young generation.

03:10.982 --> 03:14.202
Absolutely no respect

Sorry.

Are you hurt?

03:24.413 --> 03:26.336
Just my dignity.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.677
Look closely.
It's fine.

03:30.836 --> 03:33.259
Fine's not good enough,
it's got to be flawless.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.516
You look lovely.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.222
Oh, why ask a man?

03:38.385 --> 03:39.853
This is Elizabeth Arden.

I've got one chance
to make a good impression.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.731
What's so special
about her anyway?

03:45.809 --> 03:48.483
She invented
astringent, Frank.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.740
Without her, we'd all still be
washing our faces with soap.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.696
I do wash my face
with soap.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.327
Well there you are.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.505
Whatever's the matter,
Mr. Grove?

04:10.667 --> 04:13.170
A slight disagreement
with a flight of stairs.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.009
What's all this?

04:15.172 --> 04:17.641
Nothing you...
nothing you need

04:17.798 --> 04:19.016
concern yourself with,
Mr. Crabb.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.224
Mr. Grove, are you in pain?

04:25.599 --> 04:27.317
Mr. Selfridge and Miss Arden
will see you now.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.281
Oh, Mrs. Edwards, good morning,
I would like to introduce you

04:40.447 --> 04:42.700
to my very good friend,
Miss Elizabeth Arden.

04:44.576 --> 04:45.953
You've been here
since the beginning,

04:46.119 --> 04:47.245
haven't you, Mrs. Edwards?

04:47.412 --> 04:48.755
Your department
took make-up

04:48.914 --> 04:51.008
from under the counter
and put it on display.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.669
Well, I don't think,
I can take the credit...

04:53.835 --> 04:56.554
No, you can't,
because I did it first.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.135
But Selfridge's
was the first to do it

04:58.298 --> 04:59.390
this side of the Atlantic,

04:59.549 --> 05:02.268
and for that
you should be applauded.

05:03.512 --> 05:04.764
Shall we get started?

05:04.930 --> 05:05.977
Oh, right now?

05:06.139 --> 05:07.891
We have three days
to get this concession

05:08.058 --> 05:09.310
up and running after that.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.069
I got to get back
to New York.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.447
I'll leave you in the capable
hands of Mrs. Edwards.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.733
Hurry up,
Mrs. Edwards.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.027
You really must cultivate
a sense of urgency.

05:20.445 --> 05:23.073
Violette called to ask
if you're free for lunch.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.833
Your diary is clear.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.039
Tell her I'm unavailable.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.005
Very well, Mr. Selfridge.

05:34.543 --> 05:34.589
It's the wrong color.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.257
It's the wrong color.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.515
Oh, well it's baby pink,

05:40.674 --> 05:42.176
the exact shade
you specified.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.434
It doesn't fit.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.061
No, I couldn't agree more.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.973
I did in fact send a telegram
to your New York office

05:48.139 --> 05:50.107
expressing precisely
that opinion,

05:50.267 --> 05:53.191
but I was informed that this
is the official color

05:53.353 --> 05:55.902
for all Elizabeth Arden
concessions.

05:56.064 --> 06:00.661
Mr. Lyons, Freddy,
the public can't see this;

06:00.819 --> 06:02.617
it's got to change.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.702
Don't you agree,
Mrs. Edwards?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.412
Mrs. Edwards?

06:06.575 --> 06:09.545
Well it... it does stick out,
rather.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.377
The store opens
in 20 minutes,

06:12.539 --> 06:14.507
it's not possible
to change it now.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.839
If you had two minutes
and it was Christmas Eve,

06:17.002 --> 06:19.551
I'd still make you do it.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.760
I simply can't.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.048
19 minutes.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.595
You're wasting time,
Mr. Lyons.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.609
Mr. Jones.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.691
Never settle for anything
less than perfection.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.652
Let's get breakfast.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.662
I've already had
my breakfast.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.698
Not like this you haven't.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.285
This is intolerable,
I'm perfectly well.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.045
You can barely stand.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.125
I'm quite comfortable.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.541
If I require medical assistance
I shall ask for it myself.

06:55.707 --> 06:56.799
What exactly
is the problem?

06:56.958 --> 06:58.175
It's his leg, he had a fall.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.427
I can speak for myself,
thank you.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.508
I'm just trying to be helpful.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.718
Best that you leave
the patient to me.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.181
Now, let's have
a look at the injury.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.573
You've given yourself
a nasty bruise.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.609
You'll need an x-ray.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.278
I haven't time
for such things.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.448
And in the meantime,
you need to get off that leg.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.958
I'll call the Middlesex and
tell him you're on your way.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.084
I can't leave the store,
I'm far too busy.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.870
You can take a car
to the hospital

07:34.037 --> 07:36.961
or I can push you there
in a wheelchair myself.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.217
It's entirely
your choice.

07:39.376 --> 07:43.222
Elizabeth Arden isn't just
about promoting make-up,

07:43.380 --> 07:45.929
it's about helping women
to become the wives

07:46.091 --> 07:49.721
their husbands
need them to be.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.183
An Elizabeth Arden negligee

07:51.346 --> 07:53.769
isn't just a pretty
piece of chiffon,

07:53.932 --> 07:56.606
it's something a woman
can put on at 6:00 p.m.,

07:56.768 --> 07:59.897
to greet her husband home
after a hard day's work.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.407
It's past 6:00 now,

08:02.565 --> 08:05.114
one might ask why you
aren't at home in chiffon

08:05.276 --> 08:06.869
awaiting your husband?

08:07.028 --> 08:09.122
Whenever I can, I do.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.033
But I'm prepared to make
sacrifices for women everywhere.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.329
You talk a great deal about
how a woman's life should be,

08:15.495 --> 08:17.543
doting on her
husband, children.

08:17.706 --> 08:18.798
But you've left
your husband

08:18.957 --> 08:20.925
on the other side
of the Atlantic

08:21.084 --> 08:24.805
and you've chosen not
to have children yourself.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.931
May I ask which beauty
magazine you represent?

08:27.090 --> 08:28.512
I'm from the
Christian Herald.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.677
That well known
cosmetics title.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.061
(chuckling)

08:34.139 --> 08:35.311
You're right.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.350
I am married

08:37.517 --> 08:39.394
and I continue to work.

08:39.561 --> 08:42.188
I feel no shame about it.

08:42.355 --> 08:49.204
I work because children
were a gift the Lord

08:49.362 --> 08:53.663
chose not to bestow
upon my husband and me.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.419
But Thomas has
his hands full

08:56.578 --> 08:58.580
running our concessions
nationwide.

08:58.747 --> 09:03.093
And I... well, I just
try to bring some beauty

09:03.251 --> 09:04.594
into women's lives.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.005
(applause)

09:06.171 --> 09:08.219
Thank you.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.553
Thank you for
your questions.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.932
Who the hell let
the bible-basher in?

09:17.098 --> 09:19.726
We don't make a habit of
excluding the press here.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.146
You can't control them,
you can't control the story.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.529
And that's everything.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.574
Well, if you'll excuse me,

09:26.733 --> 09:29.532
I have a few more things to do
before my day is quite over.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.831
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

09:33.990 --> 09:35.617
some very
stimulating questions.

09:35.784 --> 09:38.788
(whispering): She had no right
to ask those questions.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.923
Oh, I made all that up.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.710
I never wanted children.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.131
But tell that to a room
full of women

09:50.298 --> 09:51.675
and they'll burn you
at the stake.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.598
I know that feeling
very well.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.641
Good for you.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.320
GORDON: So Cambridge will be out
of debt by the end of next year,

10:04.479 --> 10:05.696
and at Sheffield
we've managed

10:05.855 --> 10:07.402
a one and a half percent
rise in profits.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.363
One and a half,
we should send a hamper.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.154
Everyone's been working
very hard for you,

10:12.320 --> 10:13.822
and no one more than Gordon.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.241
And I'm grateful,
Grace, truly.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.704
After expansion,
all businesses

10:17.867 --> 10:19.869
go through periods
of consolidation, Pa.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.788
Consolidation--
sounds like something

10:21.955 --> 10:23.457
you need castor oil for.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.966
Our investments
are growing steadily.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.342
You just need a little patience.

Come on I want to hear

10:37.595 --> 10:39.939
Ah, you came,

Good to see you.

10:42.851 --> 10:43.977
It's been a while.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.609
I see things have progressed
in my absence.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.948
Another reason
to celebrate?

10:55.113 --> 10:57.207
Listen, how've you been
since the funeral?

10:57.365 --> 11:00.665
Tonight is not the night
to talk of maudlin things.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.044
Shall we go in?

11:06.541 --> 11:07.838
You look
beautiful tonight.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.634
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

11:11.796 --> 11:13.013
or as you should be
more accurately described,

11:13.173 --> 11:14.595
shareholders.

11:14.757 --> 11:18.512
I bring you news from
the London Stock Exchange.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.308
The newly floated Queensway
Theatre Trust shares

11:22.473 --> 11:24.976
closed at up 57.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.316
Not only have you
saved your theater,

11:27.478 --> 11:31.073
but you have tripled the
value of your investments.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.779
(applause)

11:35.904 --> 11:37.781
Impressive, isn't he?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.039
He is.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.499
Excuse me gentlemen,
I smell a free bar.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.296
The money men
are the future.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.836
The day of the
salesman is over.

11:51.002 --> 11:54.472
Now John Lewis is dead,
there's only you.

11:54.631 --> 11:58.807
How does it feel to be
a dinosaur, Harry?

11:58.968 --> 12:01.596
You should know, you're the
biggest dinosaur of them all.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.231
(chuckles)

12:03.389 --> 12:06.893
As long as there is news,
they'll be papers.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.904
Print is forever.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.738
DILLON: So tonight, it
is your bold enthusiasm

12:13.900 --> 12:17.700
for this new and exciting
opportunity that allows us

12:17.862 --> 12:20.615
not only to celebrate
the prosperity of the trust,

12:20.782 --> 12:22.034
but the
Queen's Way Theatre.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.292
Congratulations.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.625
(applause)

12:35.380 --> 12:37.303
Guess what, Harry.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.513
The star of the night.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.428
Mr. Dillon,
my husband was trying

12:41.594 --> 12:43.141
to explain your trust to me.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.977
I'm afraid he wasn't
very successful.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.062
No, no it's perfectly straight
forward, Mrs. Selfridge.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.898
Okay, the theater sells
the shares to a trust

12:49.060 --> 12:50.312
that it already owns.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.980
The trust then splits
the shares in two

12:52.146 --> 12:54.569
and sells each new share
for the price of the old one.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.451
Essentially the theater
sells the shares

12:57.610 --> 12:58.736
and keeps half
at the same time.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.621
Is that entirely ethical?

13:00.780 --> 13:01.952
It's entirely legal.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.994
It's entirely brilliant,
that's what it is.

13:05.159 --> 13:05.955
Thank you.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.089
We should set up
one of your trusts.

13:09.247 --> 13:10.339
To sell what?

13:10.498 --> 13:12.626
The provincial stores.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.887
Well, hold on a minute.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.798
It would... it would give us
a huge influx of cash.

13:18.965 --> 13:23.641
I've... I've spent ten years
building up those stores.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.056
And it's time that you
reaped the rewards.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.519
What do you say?

13:27.682 --> 13:29.650
It's never been attempted
on that scale before.

13:29.809 --> 13:30.856
Are you interested?

13:31.019 --> 13:33.647
Of course I'm interested.

13:43.614 --> 13:46.242
DILLON: The trust would have a
capital of two million shares

13:46.409 --> 13:48.457
divided into one million
six percent cumulative

13:48.619 --> 13:50.587
preference shares
of one pound each

13:50.747 --> 13:52.124
and one million
ordinary share,

13:52.290 --> 13:53.507
same value.

13:53.666 --> 13:54.963
How many would
Selfridge's retain?

13:55.126 --> 13:59.131
900,000, divided
between Gordon and Harry.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.264
Well?

14:03.426 --> 14:05.975
It's certainly an
unorthodox proposal.

14:06.137 --> 14:09.107
And it's certainly not what
these trusts were intended for.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.643
We'd be...

14:13.102 --> 14:15.230
Exploiting a loophole
in the law.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.443
Excellent.

14:16.606 --> 14:17.698
That's settled then.

14:17.857 --> 14:18.949
Hold on.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.406
If there's low uptake
our shares would devalue

14:21.569 --> 14:23.571
or we could lose control
of the stores.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.991
That's 15 stores, 5,000 staff,

14:26.157 --> 14:27.909
many of whom have worked for us
for a decade.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.420
It's their livelihoods
we'd be gambling with.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.876
You saw how successful
the theater flotation was,

14:33.039 --> 14:35.167
if we don't move now
others will get the same idea.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.337
Pa, we should wait until you can
make a considered decision.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.255
This is my considered opinion.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.298
We've only just
buried Grandma.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.557
I am getting weary

14:43.716 --> 14:44.888
of this conversation.
Pa, please!

14:45.051 --> 14:46.894
This is great for the store,
and it is great for us.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.396
Get on board.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.937
Mr. Dillon, my father's just
suffered a major bereavement.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.902
His mother was
everything to him.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.156
Yes, I understand.

14:59.315 --> 15:02.194
Given my father's...
situation,

15:02.360 --> 15:04.954
I would consider it a favor
if you would withdraw

15:05.113 --> 15:07.241
your proposal at this time.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.750
I can't do that.

15:08.908 --> 15:12.538
You know, Mr. Dillon,
it would be unfair

15:12.703 --> 15:14.831
to take advantage of
someone who is grieving.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.874
I find that offensive.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.135
My father could
lose a fortune.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.546
If you disapprove
of the trust,

15:21.712 --> 15:25.182
you should speak
to your father, not me.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.523
You have a visitor.

15:32.682 --> 15:33.934
Hello.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.226
Arthur.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.487
I wasn't expecting anyone.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.522
I can't stay long.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.158
Here.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.568
It's for you.

15:43.734 --> 15:44.860
Ah, thank you.

15:47.572 --> 15:48.915
How's the leg?

15:49.073 --> 15:51.496
Sore.

15:51.659 --> 15:56.460
But it's the enforced idleness
that's killing me.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.670
We're working men,
we always have been.

15:58.833 --> 16:03.304
I had X-rays and endless
tests at the hospital.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.057
Well, I shall see my doctor
in a couple of days time

16:06.215 --> 16:08.343
and if I can persuade him
to give me the all clear,

16:08.509 --> 16:10.932
I shall be back at my desk.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.058
Open it up.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.150
"Build your own
radio receiver."

16:25.359 --> 16:27.236
I already have a wireless.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.529
I bought it for Ernest.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.159
Oh, right yes.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.418
Of course.

16:34.577 --> 16:35.703
Of course.

16:37.788 --> 16:38.960
You could always
do it with him.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.211
Splendid idea.

16:44.170 --> 16:44.216
(children singing)

16:44.212 --> 16:48.763
(children singing)

17:13.950 --> 17:15.452
May I?

17:15.617 --> 17:17.461
Of course.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.671
I didn't know you were
a member of this church.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.130
No.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.215
I was just passing.

17:26.378 --> 17:31.055
I wanted to light a candle
for my grandmother.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.595
So sorry to hear.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.069
It was very sudden.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.572
We're all still reeling.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.949
(children singing)

17:59.078 --> 18:01.547
Lord Wynnstay,
Sally would like to say

18:01.706 --> 18:04.585
something to you on behalf
of all the children.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.128
Thank you.

18:07.295 --> 18:09.468
What are they
thanking you for?

18:09.630 --> 18:11.724
Lord Wynnstay
is our patron.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.179
Of the choir?

18:13.342 --> 18:14.468
Of the orphanage.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.933
Without him these children
would not have a roof

18:17.096 --> 18:18.188
over their heads.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.644
I really must be going,
excuse me.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.650
Thank you for coming
and thank you once again.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.026
Lord Wynnstay,
wait!

18:26.188 --> 18:27.656
Bye bye .

18:35.615 --> 18:37.834
I lost my son in the war,

18:37.992 --> 18:41.667
so I give these
war orphans a home

18:41.829 --> 18:44.457
and I get to put
a balm on my sorrow.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.752
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.794
Quite the opposite.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.588
Mrs. de Bolotoff,
I would hate my tragedy

18:50.755 --> 18:53.759
to become the
subject of gossip.

18:53.924 --> 18:57.554
Of course, I'll keep
your confidence.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.181
On one condition.

19:00.348 --> 19:01.816
Oh yes?

19:01.974 --> 19:05.103
You let me do something
for the children.

19:05.269 --> 19:09.024
Perhaps a charity
event at the store'?

19:14.445 --> 19:15.992
(Sighs)

19:16.155 --> 19:17.407
I don't understand,

19:17.573 --> 19:20.452
we followed the
instructions to the letter.

19:20.618 --> 19:24.122
It's a toy, it's meant
for little children.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.835
Well, it was
still fun to make.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.592
Yes.

19:28.751 --> 19:29.843
Hold on.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.128
Yeah.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.306
There's the offender.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.763
A loose wire.

19:36.926 --> 19:40.351
(radio static)

19:40.513 --> 19:43.642
Right, let's see
what we can find.

19:43.808 --> 19:46.106
<i>♪ Must always wear his hat ♪</i>

19:46.268 --> 19:48.942
<i>♪ Where did you get that hat? ♪</i>

19:49.105 --> 19:52.075
Oh, now your mother
used to love this song.

19:52.233 --> 19:56.113
She'd make me dance
with her to it.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.997
She used to drag me
to the dance floor.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.334
She was a wonderful dancer
your mother.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.339
Wonderful.

20:07.498 --> 20:08.624
Show me.

20:12.253 --> 20:13.800
Other way.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.386

20:34.942 --> 20:36.034

20:47.246 --> 20:48.418
Ah, very good.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.920
ROSALIE: Grandma looks
so beautiful here.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.716
"Wisconsin, 1870."

20:57.882 --> 20:59.509
That must be Pa.

20:59.675 --> 21:00.597
I can't imagine
him young.

21:00.760 --> 21:01.852
What are you doing?

21:03.929 --> 21:06.307
We're sorting Grandma's things;
we're almost through.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.897
Please leave her things alone.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.606
We're just trying to help.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.193
You won't talk about it, you
won't do what needs to be done,

21:13.355 --> 21:14.948
meanwhile Grandma's
grave is unadorned.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.359
It's not right.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.778
I will attend to it
in my own good time.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.787
Let's sort it out now.
I have to go.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.118
Oh, that will really help.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.373
Pa, please.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.079
Stay.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.415
We can do it together.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.589
I'll see you all
in the morning.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.917
HARRY:
<i>£250.</i>

21:38.672 --> 21:40.470
Raise the pot.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.308
<i>£500 .</i>

21:45.471 --> 21:47.018
Too rich for my blood.

21:47.181 --> 21:49.559
DEALER:
£500 to you, sir.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.148
You've got a tell,
Miss Dolly.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.779
I've figured you out.

21:53.938 --> 21:56.157
Put your money where
your mouth is, Mr. Selfridge.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.862
(chuckles)

22:07.660 --> 22:10.584
The lady wins.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.123
FRANK: Right, time
for bed, I'm out.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.916
No one's leaving, no excuses.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.677
No, I've got to be up
in the morning.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.134
I have a very
demanding employer.

22:20.631 --> 22:22.304
I'd stay but
I'm all out.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.105
The Dollies win,
you lose.

22:29.265 --> 22:30.357
The Dollies lose,
you also lose.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.564
They are an
expensive hobby, Harry.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.491
You've had
a bad run of luck.

22:43.654 --> 22:44.621
I'm up tonight.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.703
It's the other nights
that concern me.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.244
You know I'm good for it.

22:49.410 --> 22:50.707
I'll know you're
good for it

22:50.870 --> 22:53.168
when you've paid me,
Mr. Selfridge.

22:53.330 --> 22:54.547
Not before.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.016
(door closes)

23:08.178 --> 23:10.556
(phone ringing)

23:13.100 --> 23:16.070
Maida Vale double two one?

23:16.228 --> 23:18.322
Well, you can't,
she's asleep.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.444
Oh, it's for you.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.705
At this hour?

23:28.741 --> 23:29.913
Hello?

23:45.841 --> 23:47.309
What is it?

23:47.468 --> 23:48.594
What's wrong?

23:52.723 --> 23:53.849
I'm fine.

23:55.476 --> 23:56.648
Really.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.327
That's my husband.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.740
With the girl
he's screwing.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.874
Who took these pictures?

24:11.033 --> 24:13.456
A private detective.

24:13.619 --> 24:14.745
I had him followed.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.634
She's 22,
one of my staff.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.716
I trained her.

24:24.588 --> 24:25.840
Probably desperate
to give him

24:26.006 --> 24:27.849
a whole brood
of little brats.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.939
Well, if he thinks
I'll settle

24:34.098 --> 24:35.850
for the sake
of the Arden name,

24:36.016 --> 24:37.188
he's got another thing coming.

24:37.351 --> 24:39.729
He won't see a dime.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.445
(sobs)

24:50.280 --> 24:52.829
(sobbing): I thought we
were a team, you know'?

24:55.369 --> 24:57.337
I need my pills,
I can't find them.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.510
These won't do
you any good.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.050
Give me them.

25:11.927 --> 25:12.928
Give me.

25:19.852 --> 25:20.978
I need two or I won't sleep.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.459
Stay with me till I sleep.

25:45.669 --> 25:46.795
Please.

25:48.005 --> 25:50.383
(door opens and shuts)

25:54.386 --> 25:55.478
What was the crisis?

25:55.637 --> 25:57.310
Had she run out of rouge?

26:02.853 --> 26:04.105
She's all alone.

26:07.149 --> 26:11.450
All that money and success

26:11.612 --> 26:15.242
and it's just her

26:15.407 --> 26:17.830
in a huge, empty room.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.370
Where's her husband?

26:21.622 --> 26:22.748
Gone.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.804
You'll always have me.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.941
Good morning,
Mrs. Edwards.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.448
Good morning.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.984
What a beautiful day.

26:59.743 --> 27:06.376
Apparently it has a top speed
of 45 miles per hour.

27:06.542 --> 27:07.668
Gosh!

27:07.835 --> 27:09.257
Now wouldn't that
be something?

27:09.419 --> 27:12.343
Driving along at
45 miles per hour?

27:12.506 --> 27:14.224
It really would.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.635
(door opens)

27:15.801 --> 27:19.806
Well, I've got some
news for you.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.441
Whose car is that
parked outside?

27:22.599 --> 27:23.521
It's ours.

27:23.684 --> 27:26.062
We've got a car?

27:26.228 --> 27:27.320
(honking)

27:27.479 --> 27:28.480
ERNEST:
How fast are we going?

27:28.647 --> 27:31.400
27 miles per hour.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.777
Wow!

27:35.320 --> 27:37.618
You know, I think
I'd be rather good

27:37.781 --> 27:39.124
at this driving lark.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.377
Absolutely not.

27:41.535 --> 27:42.627
(engine revs)

27:42.786 --> 27:43.912
(laughs)

27:44.079 --> 27:45.501
Father!

27:45.664 --> 27:46.836
One more thing, Frank.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.467
Don't let the press
at the champagne

27:48.625 --> 27:50.673
until after they've filed
their report.

27:50.836 --> 27:54.215
I want to be on the front
of every paper tomorrow,

27:54.381 --> 27:56.054
not the next day.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.639
I'll get you a list
of who needs a quote.

27:58.802 --> 28:00.804
Gordon, you're late.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.143
We're on stage
in 30 minutes.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.354
Frank wrote you a speech
for the launch party.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.314
I need to talk to you
about Jimmy Dillon.

28:08.103 --> 28:10.071
I'll leave you to it.

28:11.523 --> 28:15.403
He... has a reputation
in the city.

28:15.569 --> 28:17.321
I would expect no less.

28:17.487 --> 28:18.989
I've done some digging

28:19.156 --> 28:21.409
and not all of his enterprises
have been successful.

28:21.575 --> 28:22.326
I know.

28:22.492 --> 28:24.460
You do?

28:24.620 --> 28:26.293
Of course.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.423
This isn't just
your reputation.

28:28.582 --> 28:29.834
Those stores look to me.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.254
Gordon, I need you on
that stage to support me.

28:35.631 --> 28:38.510
I hope I can rely on you
to do the right thing.

28:50.479 --> 28:51.571
Miss Ellis,

28:51.730 --> 28:53.858
it's 5:00 o'clock.

28:54.024 --> 28:56.197
I do have eyes in my head,
thank you very much.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.665
Very well, off you go.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.542
(cheers)

29:04.701 --> 29:08.205
You are not to talk to anybody
unless addressed directly.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.545
This is a very
exclusive party.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.459
No one wants to hear
from the likes of you.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.428
(excited chatter)

29:22.803 --> 29:25.352
Oh, Miss Brockless...

29:25.514 --> 29:27.061
I need this lot
sent out tonight.

29:27.224 --> 29:29.568
Can you take it down to
Miss Grove in the stock room?

29:29.726 --> 29:32.400
Dispatch has already gone.

29:32.562 --> 29:34.280
It'll give us a
head start tomorrow.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.621
(door opens)

29:41.780 --> 29:45.125
Too late, you've missed
the dispatch collection.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.581
I know.

29:46.743 --> 29:48.495
So why are you here?

29:48.662 --> 29:49.754
You're missing the party.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.586
Miss Ellis sent me.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.131
Come with me.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.137
I'll sneak you in.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.173
I better get on.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.684
I can't afford
to get into trouble.

30:02.843 --> 30:04.937
Enjoy the canapés.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.149
HARRY: Tonight we
announce the flotation

30:09.308 --> 30:13.313
of our department stores
in every major British city.

30:13.478 --> 30:17.358
And to do that we have the
chief executive of those stores,

30:17.524 --> 30:19.197
although I know him
better as my son.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.033
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gordon Selfridge.

30:22.195 --> 30:25.825
(applause)

30:41.798 --> 30:43.516
15 department stores,
5,000 employees.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.761
15 department stores,
5,000 employees.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.516
The Gordon Selfridge's Trust

30:51.683 --> 30:53.310
offers the public the chance

30:53.477 --> 30:56.902
to be a part of the biggest
chain of stores in the country

30:57.064 --> 30:59.032
and who wouldn't
want a piece

30:59.191 --> 31:00.738
of Selfridge's
in their pocket'?

31:00.901 --> 31:03.700
(applause)

31:12.120 --> 31:13.246
Great so far.

31:20.587 --> 31:21.759
GEORGE: But it's a
good investment.

31:21.922 --> 31:23.219
Don't start on this again,
George.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.884
I've told you.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.724
Stocks and shares are just
gambling for rich people.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.604
It's immoral.

31:29.763 --> 31:31.561
You were happy
enough to come.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.851
Well of course I'm gonna come,
there's canapés.

31:35.852 --> 31:36.944
It's French.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.106
(giggles)

31:39.272 --> 31:43.448
I was wondering when you might

31:43.610 --> 31:44.953
put me back on
the shop floor,

31:45.112 --> 31:46.989
Mrs. Towler?

31:47.155 --> 31:49.704
When you're good and ready.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.038
When's that gonna be?

31:52.619 --> 31:53.871
When I'm good and ready!

31:59.960 --> 32:01.086
Excuse me.

32:11.388 --> 32:13.265
I missed lunch.

32:13.432 --> 32:16.561
♪♪

32:22.899 --> 32:24.025
Thank you.

32:25.610 --> 32:28.705
We haven't actually met,
but I feel like I know you.

32:28.864 --> 32:29.990
I'm Jenny Dolly.

32:30.157 --> 32:31.704
I know who you are.

32:31.867 --> 32:34.461
I know your father.

32:34.619 --> 32:35.711
I know that, too.

32:35.871 --> 32:39.751
I feel like we could be
great friends, you and I.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.793
Whatever gave you
that impression?

32:42.961 --> 32:44.679
You're not so special.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.182
Who are you to judge me?

32:48.341 --> 32:49.809
Oh my word!

32:49.968 --> 32:52.187
Sorry.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.813
Here let me get it,
let me get it.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.440
Please, please!

32:55.599 --> 32:57.693
Jesus, you guys
are all so uptight, huh?

32:57.851 --> 32:58.943
Come on!

32:59.102 --> 33:00.945
Time to get you home.

33:01.104 --> 33:03.027
No, I'm having a good time
with my new friends.

33:03.190 --> 33:04.282
Enough.
Get off!

33:04.441 --> 33:05.363
(glass shatters)

33:05.525 --> 33:06.617
What's going on?

33:06.776 --> 33:08.198
Is she all right?

33:08.361 --> 33:10.455
Are these the people you
choosing to associate with?

33:10.614 --> 33:12.491
I'm standing
right here.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.000
Look, Jenny is just a little
emotional right now.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.206
We both know what she is.

33:15.368 --> 33:17.541
She's a friend.

33:17.704 --> 33:19.502
What would Grandma think
of your friends?

33:28.340 --> 33:29.762
Thank you.

33:29.925 --> 33:31.802
I'm used to society
people seeing my face

33:31.968 --> 33:33.390
and jumping to conclusions,

33:33.553 --> 33:36.853
but I expected more from
Harry Selfridge's son.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.688
You can dig all
you like, Gordon,

33:38.850 --> 33:40.852
but you won't find
any dirt on me.

33:45.190 --> 33:48.239
What does Pa
see in those women?

33:48.401 --> 33:50.153
It's an infatuation.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.698
You know Pa,
it won't last.

33:52.864 --> 33:55.913
Jimmy Dillon's just another
kind of infatuation.

33:56.076 --> 33:57.168
That'll pass, too.

33:57.327 --> 33:58.499
I don't know what you mean.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.336
Of course you don't.

34:05.669 --> 34:07.216
I'm going back to Paris.

34:07.379 --> 34:12.431
Vi, you can't,
not with him like this.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.139
I should never
have come back.

34:14.302 --> 34:15.428
He's all yours.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.356
MERYL:
Try one.

34:21.518 --> 34:22.610
They're delicious.

34:22.768 --> 34:26.239
Those ones have
cream fillings.

34:36.699 --> 34:37.871
(door opens)

34:38.034 --> 34:40.661
Here's some more
for you.

34:40.829 --> 34:41.920
What's that?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.458
They're just canapés.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.670
Does your father know what
you're doing down here?

34:48.837 --> 34:50.464
I work here.

34:50.630 --> 34:51.426
You know what I mean.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.638
It's none of your business
what I do

34:53.800 --> 34:56.553
or who I speak to.

34:56.719 --> 34:57.846
If you want back

34:58.013 --> 34:59.481
on the shop floor,

34:59.639 --> 35:01.232
you're not
helping yourself.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.696
That showed her.

35:10.859 --> 35:13.487
She didn't like me anyway,
now she's got good reason.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.326
Sorry.

35:15.488 --> 35:16.580
Jobs in fashion do not
come around often.

35:16.740 --> 35:17.992
Not for people like me.

35:18.158 --> 35:19.751
I can't lose it.

35:28.418 --> 35:29.544
HARRY
Jenny?

35:31.087 --> 35:33.465
I can't find
any damn cream.

35:40.138 --> 35:43.642
Rosie's right--
anything we build up,

35:43.808 --> 35:44.934
I have to tear it down.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.779
There's something
very wrong with me, Harry.

35:48.938 --> 35:51.157
I don't believe that
for a moment.

35:53.109 --> 35:54.907
You're with Rosie, not me.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.196
That says something.

35:56.363 --> 35:58.286
That doesn't mean that
I don't think you're great.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.576
Really?

36:00.742 --> 36:02.119
Really.

36:02.285 --> 36:05.164
What would of happened
if you'd met me first?

36:08.083 --> 36:10.962
I hope you're going
to make her pay for that.

36:11.127 --> 36:14.176
I don't want Miss Arden
accusing us of stealing.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.966
There you are,
I've missed you.

36:24.516 --> 36:28.862
ROSIE: Come on, let's
get back to the party.

36:29.020 --> 36:29.066
KITTY: I already run
the biggest department

36:29.062 --> 36:30.735
KITTY: I already run
the biggest department

36:30.897 --> 36:33.650
of the best department store
in the world.

36:33.817 --> 36:35.490
You've been doing
that for a decade.

36:37.987 --> 36:40.365
What's the next step
for you at Selfridge's?

36:40.532 --> 36:42.910
Is there one?

36:43.660 --> 36:45.003
Well...

36:45.161 --> 36:48.415
I want you to run my
department store concessions.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.834
All of them.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.877
My husband isn't
at my company anymore.

36:53.044 --> 36:56.264
I'll double your salary

36:56.423 --> 36:59.017
and provide you an apartment
on the West Side.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.769
West Side of what?

37:01.928 --> 37:03.601
New York, silly.

37:03.763 --> 37:06.141
I want you to work
for me in New York.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.020
(laughs)

37:15.442 --> 37:16.739
Why me?

37:16.901 --> 37:18.323
You barely know me.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.409
I know you better
than you think,

37:20.572 --> 37:22.415
because you're just like me.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.202
You're a modern woman.

37:25.368 --> 37:27.962
In New York, a woman can
choose to be in business

37:28.121 --> 37:30.340
without being a pariah.

37:30.498 --> 37:32.842
Isn't that what you want?

37:36.004 --> 37:37.597
New York?

37:39.466 --> 37:41.844
I've never even
dreamt of it.

37:44.053 --> 37:47.728
I'd have to talk to Frank.

37:52.312 --> 37:55.737
MAN:
Mr. Grove, please sit down.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.536
The diagnosis is based
on the test we did

37:59.694 --> 38:02.163
(fading out): to your blood and
sputum for suspicious cells

38:02.322 --> 38:04.791
and the results
from the pathology lab...

38:04.949 --> 38:07.372
(voice not audible)

38:23.134 --> 38:25.512
WOMAN:
Sir, are you all right'?

38:28.014 --> 38:30.938
I'm quite all right,
really.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.062
There's no need
to make fuss.

38:35.605 --> 38:37.983
Is there someone
I can call?

38:42.320 --> 38:43.492
FRANK: <i>"Harry Selfridge
doesn't so much</i>

38:43.655 --> 38:45.453
"push the boundaries
of good taste

38:45.615 --> 38:47.492
"as dance across them with
a cocktail in one hand

38:47.659 --> 38:50.458
and a chorus girl in the other."

38:50.620 --> 38:52.247
This is not good.

38:58.503 --> 39:00.881
I've some news.

39:02.215 --> 39:04.434
Elizabeth Arden
offered me a job.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.469
How is the old witch?

39:06.636 --> 39:10.357
She's difficult,
I know, but...

39:10.515 --> 39:14.145
she wants me to come and
work for her in New York.

39:17.981 --> 39:20.530
What did you say?

39:20.692 --> 39:24.322
I said I'd discuss
it with you.

39:27.282 --> 39:29.580
What's to discuss?

39:31.828 --> 39:33.580
Well, it's good money.

39:35.123 --> 39:36.420
It could support us both.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.335
You wouldn't have
to run around doing

39:38.501 --> 39:40.924
your publicity,
you could write

39:41.087 --> 39:42.839
full-time.

39:43.006 --> 39:44.883
"Run around"?

39:45.049 --> 39:46.551
You want me to give up
my position,

39:46.718 --> 39:49.141
cross the Atlantic,
just so you can go

39:49.304 --> 39:51.523
touting your
facial powders?

39:51.681 --> 39:55.276
This is my chance.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.563
Take the next step
in my career.

39:57.729 --> 39:58.901
At the expense of mine.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.035
I didn't realize you thought
so little of what I do.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.370
Roger, how are you?

40:14.537 --> 40:16.539
They said you needed
help returning home.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.586
It's neuropathy.

40:23.046 --> 40:25.890
Damage to the nerves
in my foot.

40:26.049 --> 40:28.017
That sounds painful.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.554
It comes and goes.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.149
Why I fell in
the first place.

40:35.308 --> 40:38.938
I didn't... slip,
I knew I hadn't.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.355
Right.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.148
Shall we get you home?

40:42.315 --> 40:44.443
I've never driven before,
but I'm sure if you give me

40:44.609 --> 40:48.284
some guidance I can get
us to our destination.

40:48.446 --> 40:52.076
The neuropathy is caused
by a tumor on my brain.

40:54.327 --> 40:58.423
There are more in
my lungs.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.003
And my liver.

41:05.338 --> 41:07.716
What can they do?

41:09.175 --> 41:10.347
Nothing.

41:15.056 --> 41:17.559
How much...?

41:17.725 --> 41:20.103
Not long.

41:25.441 --> 41:28.786
You don't have to face
this on your own.

41:28.945 --> 41:30.242
Do you understand?

41:31.823 --> 41:32.949
You're not alone.

41:42.667 --> 41:45.591
(children arguing)

41:57.849 --> 42:00.853
MERYL: Sit down so we can all listen
to the radio and just enjoy it.

42:01.019 --> 42:03.272
ERNEST: Daddy, can you tell her that
she can't always have her own way.

42:03.438 --> 42:06.191
Dad, he's been fiddling
with the radio all evening.

42:07.650 --> 42:08.742
Who fancies a drive?

42:08.901 --> 42:10.403
Yes!

42:10.570 --> 42:12.117
Supper is almost ready,
Mr. Grove,

42:12.280 --> 42:15.250
and I was about
to give Ernest his bath.

42:15.408 --> 42:17.627
He has school tomorrow.

42:17.785 --> 42:24.885
Well, we can worry
about tomorrow... tomorrow.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.386
Who wants to ride
up front with me?

42:33.134 --> 42:34.477
CHILDREN:
♪ Where did you get that hat'? ♪

42:34.635 --> 42:37.058

42:37.221 --> 42:41.818

42:41.976 --> 42:46.231

HARRY:
When does trading start?

42:55.948 --> 42:57.074
FRANK:
Any minute now.

42:58.367 --> 43:01.086
Ah, where's the champagne?

43:01.245 --> 43:02.667
I organized a crate
to be sent up.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.548
I'll check, they were
putting it on ice.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.552
You love it, don't you?

43:11.714 --> 43:13.091
The roll of the dice.

43:15.259 --> 43:19.309
The highs are great,
but the lows...

43:19.472 --> 43:21.975
Sometimes I think it's only
the pain of the lows

43:22.141 --> 43:24.564
that really lets me
actually feel something.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.532
I don't understand.

43:29.690 --> 43:32.239
I don't think I ever have.

43:32.401 --> 43:33.493
I know.

43:33.653 --> 43:34.779
DILLON:
Harry!

43:37.240 --> 43:38.583
Jimmy does.

43:40.868 --> 43:41.710
(bell dinging)

43:41.869 --> 43:42.995
We're off.

43:44.288 --> 43:45.380
MAN:
Here we go, gentleman!

43:45.540 --> 43:48.293
(excited chatter)

43:50.419 --> 43:52.467
That's where you
should be looking.

43:52.630 --> 43:54.928
The share price is 71
that's a good start.

43:56.467 --> 43:57.719
(excited chatter)

43:57.885 --> 44:00.183
You, five?

44:01.764 --> 44:02.890
DILLON:
Yes!

44:06.102 --> 44:09.777
(indistinct chatter)

44:13.109 --> 44:14.986
It's going
through the roof.

44:15.153 --> 44:16.996
(cheering)

44:21.367 --> 44:22.459
Harry...

44:22.618 --> 44:23.870
Oh my apologies,
wrong Dolly.

44:24.036 --> 44:25.288
Easy mistake.

44:25.454 --> 44:26.546
I'm so sorry.

44:26.706 --> 44:27.832
I'm fine.

44:29.208 --> 44:31.176
Really, it's fine.

44:31.335 --> 44:32.507
Ladies, allow me.

44:34.589 --> 44:37.934
Congratulations, Harry,
we've pulled off quite a coup.

44:38.092 --> 44:39.469
Feels great, doesn't it?

44:39.635 --> 44:41.182
It does.

44:45.474 --> 44:46.566
Well done.

44:46.726 --> 44:49.104
(exhales)

44:58.070 --> 45:00.368
Ah, good to see you, son.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.408
I wanted to talk to you
about what we do

45:02.575 --> 45:04.998
with our first dividends
from the trust.

45:05.161 --> 45:08.165
You're right, we reward
all the hard work

45:08.331 --> 45:09.127
by reinvesting...

45:09.290 --> 45:10.667
Whatever you want.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.710
Just call me when you need me
to sign on the dotted line.

45:12.877 --> 45:15.050
Well, that's a
little ungrateful.

45:15.213 --> 45:16.965
I just made you a
millionaire many times over.

45:17.131 --> 45:19.304
You gambled with everything
I've built to do it.

45:19.467 --> 45:21.265
And I won; we won.

45:21.427 --> 45:23.850
That's all that matters
to you, isn't it?

45:25.806 --> 45:27.058
You've lost Violette.

45:27.225 --> 45:29.603
Did you even
notice she'd gone?

45:31.103 --> 45:33.481
(scoffs)

45:36.817 --> 45:37.943
You're in danger
of losing everyone

45:38.110 --> 45:40.579
who truly cares about you.

45:44.367 --> 45:46.165
