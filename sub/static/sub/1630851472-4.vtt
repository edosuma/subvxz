01:24.920 --> 01:26.320
Argh!

01:26.880 --> 01:28.080
Woah, what's going on?

01:30.080 --> 01:31.800
A severe placenta abruption.

01:31.880 --> 01:33.800
Okay we need to get a line in.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.120
Okay, come on.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.840
Somebody tell me what's happening!

01:37.920 --> 01:38.920
Let's go.

02:18.920 --> 02:20.280
Hello. Alright.

02:57.800 --> 02:58.720
Mummy?

03:03.600 --> 03:04.440
Mummy?

03:09.520 --> 03:10.360
Mummy?

03:18.880 --> 03:20.400
Mummy, where are you going?

03:33.240 --> 03:34.640
<i>Were you trying to escape?</i>

03:35.200 --> 03:36.160
<i>Again?</i>

03:36.960 --> 03:38.160
Oh, shut the fuck up.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.200
What's that?

03:40.280 --> 03:41.080
Nothing.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.120
I'm going into the office
before the hospital, okay?

03:45.200 --> 03:46.960
I'm gonna take the car out today.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.040
You're not supposed to drive,
you know.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.120
You might hurt yourself
or somebody else.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.360
Okay, I'll take a taxi.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.200
Sorry.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.480
- See you later.
- See you!

04:22.680 --> 04:25.680
<i>I like it.
You're going to hell anyway.</i>

04:26.760 --> 04:28.080
<i>Taking out the odd pedestrian</i>

04:28.160 --> 04:30.360
<i>won't make much of a difference
at this stage.</i>

06:13.120 --> 06:13.920
Oh.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.120
Wasn't who I was expecting.

06:20.800 --> 06:21.880
Can I come in?

06:24.600 --> 06:25.800
Of course.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.560
I'm here to see you.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.720
Am I in trouble? I can't wait.

07:02.520 --> 07:03.880
How's your head today?

07:11.520 --> 07:12.320
Thomas,

07:13.960 --> 07:15.280
what have we been up to?

07:18.640 --> 07:19.520
Mum?

07:19.600 --> 07:21.120
Oh, Sash.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.520
Mum, hi.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.960
Sash.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.840
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

07:28.480 --> 07:29.520
You alright?

07:30.680 --> 07:32.400
I'm tired

07:32.480 --> 07:34.880
and my head hurts.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.560
I shouldn't have come.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.240
Mum, here, sit down.

07:46.680 --> 07:47.480
Bye, Jo.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.240
- Sash.
- Yeah.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.520
When you're having a baby,

08:04.520 --> 08:06.200
you're going to have to depend

08:07.040 --> 08:08.400
on that person.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.760
So it's...

08:11.840 --> 08:14.400
You have to be really sure

08:15.760 --> 08:16.720
of that.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.600
I am sure, mum.

08:19.840 --> 08:21.640
Yeah, where's this coming from?

08:23.320 --> 08:24.520
Oh, Sash.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.320
Fuck.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.400
What?

09:01.160 --> 09:03.280
Is there something on your mind?

09:06.080 --> 09:09.600
What was I like last year to you?

09:12.600 --> 09:14.840
You dipped a bit
when Finn went to uni,

09:14.920 --> 09:17.440
but he is the sun, moon and stars.

09:17.520 --> 09:18.680
No, he's not.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.040
I know.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.000
Dad was worried about you, I know,

09:25.080 --> 09:28.560
but then you started working
for that charity

09:28.640 --> 09:30.600
and doing all that amazing stuff.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.360
To be honest, you grew last year mum,
you blossomed.

09:36.600 --> 09:37.560
- I did?
- Mm.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.280
Oh.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.840
You're gonna be fine, mum.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.520
You're gonna get through this.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.160
Hi.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.880
You really shouldn't be driving.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.560
Are you offering to drive for me?

10:17.640 --> 10:20.440
Mum, this is awkward
so I'm just gonna say it.

10:20.520 --> 10:25.440
Can you not just drop by
unannounced again?

10:26.080 --> 10:27.600
Has he told you to say that?

10:28.520 --> 10:30.120
No, no.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.440
Okay, look, for as long
as I can remember you have always,

10:34.600 --> 10:35.920
my friends always loved you

10:36.000 --> 10:37.840
and they'd come to the house
to see me

10:37.920 --> 10:40.000
and they'd end up
spending most of the time

10:40.080 --> 10:41.640
in the kitchen talking to you.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.160
I just, I thought

10:45.480 --> 10:48.800
with Thomas that for once...

10:52.040 --> 10:54.200
I love you mum, but can you just

10:54.800 --> 10:56.720
fucking stick to people your own age?

10:58.600 --> 10:59.400
Please.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.200
Fuck!

11:34.360 --> 11:35.240
Fuck!

12:00.840 --> 12:01.960
Do you need some help?

12:08.640 --> 12:11.400
Great night, Mrs. Harding. Thanks.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.720
I've been getting bits of memories.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.240
I just can't piece them together

12:24.640 --> 12:25.720
and sometimes they're

12:26.640 --> 12:27.800
quite upsetting.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.720
But you're getting
some memories back at least.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.120
Well that's good, isn't it?
She's making progress.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.960
Sometimes I think

12:42.360 --> 12:44.560
I see and hear things and

12:45.520 --> 12:47.320
I'm not sure if they're real.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.920
Hallucinations?

12:51.360 --> 12:52.640
They're getting more vivid

12:54.160 --> 12:54.960
and...

12:55.840 --> 12:59.160
it's like I'm drowning and...

13:01.160 --> 13:02.480
it's very frightening.

13:03.160 --> 13:03.960
Okay.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.560
Well, those aren't a consequence
of your head injury,

13:11.320 --> 13:13.880
but they can be an effect
of your time in ICU.

13:16.480 --> 13:20.320
I'm going to refer you

13:21.080 --> 13:22.680
to a neuro psychologist.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.120
The good news is
there's no further bleeding

13:27.680 --> 13:28.760
or collection.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.040
I can't make any promises
about you making a complete recovery.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.560
You both know that, right?

13:38.520 --> 13:41.560
I think you should probably
also tell her about fucking Thomas.

13:45.720 --> 13:46.640
You okay?

13:54.400 --> 13:55.240
Mm.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.000
You know what?

14:02.440 --> 14:04.280
I think I forgot my phone back there.

14:04.840 --> 14:08.400
Why don't you just go off
to the office and I will get a taxi?

14:08.480 --> 14:10.680
- Okay, you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:19.640 --> 14:20.760
Dr. Cadell?

14:20.840 --> 14:21.680
You're back.

14:22.200 --> 14:25.000
I want to see my medical records
from last year, all of them.

14:25.080 --> 14:28.040
Jo, I have another patient
in about five minutes.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.480
I know it's my right.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.480
Can you just please look them up?
They're right there.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.520
They're not actually,
they're with your GP.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.200
What is it exactly that you want?

14:41.240 --> 14:42.040
It's...

14:45.920 --> 14:47.640
It's the memories I've been having.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.280
I don't recognise myself in them,

14:51.360 --> 14:54.080
I need to know
what was my state of mind.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.240
Is there something specific
that you've remembered?

14:59.800 --> 15:01.000
I can't make sense of it.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.880
Was I struggling before I fell?

15:07.960 --> 15:08.760
Jo,

15:09.640 --> 15:12.520
you are a woman of a certain age...

15:14.760 --> 15:16.440
mood swings, lack of motivation,

15:17.280 --> 15:18.200
anxiety.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.240
They can be symptoms of depression,

15:23.200 --> 15:25.000
but also of the menopause.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.840
And yes, for many women
it is a struggle,

15:30.920 --> 15:34.880
but for some
it can be a time of re-invention.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.120
Hi, Jo.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.040
I'm Nick.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.520
Oh, right.

16:46.760 --> 16:47.560
Nick.

16:48.960 --> 16:49.920
Mm.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.400
Rose mentioned
what happened to you, um.

16:53.120 --> 16:53.960
I'm really sorry.

16:56.800 --> 16:57.840
Thank you.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.040
Could we talk somewhere?

17:03.400 --> 17:06.320
I don't remember anything
about this place.

17:08.360 --> 17:09.160
Okay.

17:10.840 --> 17:11.640
Sure.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.320
So I...

17:24.680 --> 17:25.600
I worked here

17:26.320 --> 17:27.640
for several months,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.480
but then you fired me?

17:33.080 --> 17:34.080
It's...

17:35.760 --> 17:37.600
It's very strange that you've come.

17:39.240 --> 17:42.120
And, you know,
you leaving wasn't a big deal.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.440
We just came to the end
of a big project and, you know.

17:48.320 --> 17:51.800
Could you just please fill me in
on everything?

17:54.080 --> 17:57.000
Look, Jo, when you first walked
through those doors,

17:58.360 --> 17:59.400
you lacked a little

18:00.680 --> 18:01.520
self-belief,

18:02.840 --> 18:03.680
maybe.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.840
Trying to choose my words
carefully here.

18:06.920 --> 18:07.720
Don't.

18:08.960 --> 18:09.880
Just say it.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.040
You were unhappy.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.120
You were searching for something and

18:18.720 --> 18:20.400
I think you found it here.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.720
Is everything okay at home?

18:28.400 --> 18:29.280
With Rob?

18:31.800 --> 18:33.240
Why are you asking me that?

18:33.320 --> 18:35.360
Oh, Christ, this is difficult.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.320
I think you felt that Rob's

18:42.560 --> 18:43.360
temper

18:44.280 --> 18:46.200
was responsible for a lot of things.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.760
You said his business
had been struggling

18:50.640 --> 18:54.520
and the atmosphere
between you both was strained.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.040
I think you felt restricted
by your life.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.760
I think it blossomed working here.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.480
<i>There's that word again.</i>

19:08.600 --> 19:09.520
<i>Blossomed.</i>

19:10.080 --> 19:11.600
And I don't think he liked it.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.000
I have to go.

19:24.000 --> 19:24.800
Helen.

19:25.440 --> 19:28.480
Helen, this is Jo,
Jo from the Headbangers Group.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.720
I really need
to speak to you right away.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.000
I knew Rob had money problems,

19:34.080 --> 19:36.000
but they may be worse than I thought.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.160
He told me
to follow the breadcrumbs, Helen,

19:38.240 --> 19:41.040
and I don't like
where they've fucking taken me.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.000
Oh.

19:57.000 --> 19:57.880
Oh, my god!

19:59.800 --> 20:00.600
Oh!

20:40.760 --> 20:43.120
<i>I opened up the jewellery box</i>

20:44.400 --> 20:47.240
<i>and found a charming copper fox.</i>

20:51.640 --> 20:53.720
I then could simply not resist

20:54.320 --> 20:58.920
to slide it gently on my wrist.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.040
<i>I held my hand up in the air,</i>

21:04.120 --> 21:07.920
<i>admiring his wildly stare.</i>

21:11.640 --> 21:13.840
I'm sorry
for when I've been a bad mummy.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.920
What the fuck?

21:48.000 --> 21:48.800
Wendy?

21:50.480 --> 21:52.480
I just wanted
to talk to you for a second.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.680
I am really sorry,
I am in a hurry. Can this...

21:54.760 --> 21:56.120
It's just...

21:56.960 --> 21:58.880
I was at the nursing home

21:59.640 --> 22:00.760
seeing your father.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.160
We're actually friends.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.800
He was very lonely
when your mum died and we...

22:07.880 --> 22:09.720
He was not lonely, he had us.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.640
Have you been hitting on my father?

22:13.720 --> 22:15.640
Look, even if he doesn't know
who I am

22:15.720 --> 22:18.800
most of the time he's still
a human being, and I am too.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.320
I don't think you've been comfortable
seeing your father

22:22.400 --> 22:23.640
over the last few months.

22:24.880 --> 22:28.400
I think it upset you
watching his demise,

22:28.480 --> 22:32.200
and you saved yourself the pain
and there's no shame in that,

22:32.280 --> 22:34.880
only in pretending there's not,
but you're sorry...

23:29.200 --> 23:31.440
Oh, Jesus, Rob.

23:52.600 --> 23:55.120
- Helen.
- I came straight round.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.000
Thank you.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.240
You sounded so frightened
on the message.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.880
It's so good to see you.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.400
Come on in.

24:06.480 --> 24:07.320
This way.

24:08.600 --> 24:09.960
Do you wanna have a seat?

24:13.720 --> 24:14.720
Listen,

24:15.760 --> 24:17.440
there's so much going on here.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.800
Last year,
Rob was losing a lot of money.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.280
His firm was leaking cash,

24:25.360 --> 24:26.800
so he's been very stressed.

24:28.360 --> 24:31.800
And then the money,
it's all mine.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.200
I inherited it
from my grandparents, you see, so

24:36.840 --> 24:38.080
and then I...

24:40.520 --> 24:43.000
I did something unimaginable, okay?

24:44.280 --> 24:46.040
I did the worst thing

24:47.200 --> 24:49.240
anyone can do to their family,

24:49.760 --> 24:52.880
with the worst possible person.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.640
Okay, okay. It's okay.

24:56.720 --> 24:59.160
No, it's not okay.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.400
I don't know what to do.

25:05.640 --> 25:06.680
Sh!

25:12.680 --> 25:15.480
Just talk to me.
I'm not gonna judge you.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.680
I think he did it.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.360
I think Rob hurt me.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.880
- Oh, my god.
- Jo, are you in there?

25:26.960 --> 25:28.000
What do I do?

25:28.680 --> 25:31.480
You need to just keep yourself safe.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.440
- We can get out of here.
- Who are you talking to?

25:33.520 --> 25:35.840
Through the garden.
if I could get this door open.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.080
Jo open the door.

25:37.840 --> 25:38.960
I need you to let me in.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.480
No, I'm not letting you in!

25:41.560 --> 25:42.720
- I can't let him in.
- Jo!

25:42.800 --> 25:44.440
- Are you sure about this?
- Go away!

25:44.520 --> 25:46.320
You thought
you did it to yourself and,

25:46.400 --> 25:48.120
and now you're convinced it's Rob.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.480
I need you to let me in.

25:53.640 --> 25:54.480
He'll kill me.

25:55.680 --> 25:56.720
He'll kill me.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.640
- How do you know where I live?
- Jo.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.000
No!

26:08.080 --> 26:09.520
Stay away from me!

26:09.600 --> 26:10.520
Helen!

26:13.440 --> 26:14.400
She was right there.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.640
No, she was right there.

26:18.600 --> 26:21.520
She was right there!
She was right there!

26:21.600 --> 26:22.520
Jo what's going on?

26:28.320 --> 26:29.720
Don't do that. Hey, hey.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.840
Sshh, don't do that.

26:34.520 --> 26:36.160
Sshh.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.400
It's okay.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.200
It's okay.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.160
it's okay.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.120
I love you.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.120
I'm right here, I'm here.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.680
I'll always be here.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.080
Jo, you okay?

27:22.560 --> 27:23.360
Yeah.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.280
Finn?

28:36.960 --> 28:37.800
Hello, dad.

28:38.880 --> 28:39.760
It's Jo.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.520
I brought you a pie.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.040
Ah.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.840
It's plum, like mum used to make.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.440
How are you, Finn?

28:53.520 --> 28:56.160
I was just
explaining to Finn that I,

28:56.240 --> 28:58.080
I want to go up in a firework.

28:58.160 --> 29:00.600
Grandad says you can have your ashes
put in a firework.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.680
That's how I wanna go out as well,
out with a bang.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.880
Can we like,
not talk about that right now?

29:04.960 --> 29:07.200
Oh, she's squeamish.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.480
No-one leaves this place

29:10.560 --> 29:12.440
unless they land laid in a box.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.040
Susan.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.720
Dad, I'm not mum.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.080
It's me, Jo.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.480
I'm worried about you.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.400
Why are you worried
about her, grandad?

29:26.480 --> 29:30.240
I don't think
she feels loved enough by us.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.240
By you, Susan.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.880
I don't think,
I don't think that's true.

29:36.960 --> 29:38.760
But you need to be a better mother.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.760
- I'll be back next week.
- Yeah!

29:45.400 --> 29:46.520
Finn.

29:49.640 --> 29:53.280
I'm so sorry for what I did
to you and Josh.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.320
I didn't mean to hurt you.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.040
But I was just trying to protect you.

29:59.720 --> 30:00.920
I don't need protecting.

30:05.520 --> 30:06.480
Bye, mum.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.360
So,

30:14.080 --> 30:15.160
my daughter Jo.

30:17.480 --> 30:18.360
Dad.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.280
I know who you are.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.960
I'm not a goddamned idiot.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.480
You were the naughty one.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.200
I was your only one.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.920
And I'm not that naughty.

30:35.800 --> 30:36.600
That looks good.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.920
She used to act out this one.

30:40.040 --> 30:43.680
Sort her dolls in half
and writing on walls

30:44.600 --> 30:46.320
and set fire to her cat.

30:46.400 --> 30:47.280
I didn't.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.760
I didn't set fire to a cat.

30:50.760 --> 30:54.680
She pressed
a hot iron into her own arm.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.720
I'm sorry, I don't speak Danish.

30:56.800 --> 30:57.960
Why did I do that?

30:58.920 --> 31:00.480
I'll just put this in the fridge.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.800
There must have been a reason.

31:08.040 --> 31:08.840
Dad,

31:10.360 --> 31:12.840
do you remember
I had an accident last month?

31:14.040 --> 31:15.360
I fell down the stairs.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.320
Oh, my baby.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.520
Who did this?

31:23.160 --> 31:24.280
I don't know.

31:25.520 --> 31:26.880
I don't know what to think.

31:27.560 --> 31:28.360
It's like

31:28.880 --> 31:30.760
I can't keep things straight in here.

31:32.840 --> 31:33.640
Do you think...

31:35.840 --> 31:38.280
I could have done something so awful

31:38.360 --> 31:39.360
to myself

31:40.160 --> 31:40.960
again?

32:22.520 --> 32:25.600
What the hell were you thinking?

32:26.200 --> 32:27.600
That's horrible.

32:29.560 --> 32:33.040
What do you think Dad will say?

32:47.360 --> 32:49.280
<i>Ring a ring a roses</i>

32:49.360 --> 32:51.160
<i>A pocket full of posies</i>

32:51.240 --> 32:53.080
<i>A tissue, a tissue</i>

32:53.160 --> 32:54.760
<i>We all fall down</i>

32:55.480 --> 32:56.280
Josh.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.520
I heard your mum here, Ella,
in the garden

32:59.600 --> 33:01.880
so, I just let myself in.

33:01.960 --> 33:02.960
Course you did.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.920
<i>A pocket full of posies</i>

33:12.000 --> 33:14.240
<i>A tissue, a tissue</i>

33:14.320 --> 33:16.440
<i>We all fall down</i>

33:16.520 --> 33:18.440
<i>A tissue, a tissue</i>

33:18.520 --> 33:20.120
<i>We all fall down</i>

33:20.200 --> 33:21.240
You're out?

33:22.160 --> 33:23.440
In the world?

33:23.520 --> 33:24.400
Yes, I am.

33:25.960 --> 33:26.800
Hi, Ella.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.760
Ella, it's Jo.

33:30.360 --> 33:31.440
Can we talk?

33:32.440 --> 33:35.320
<i>Fire away, a tissue, a tissue</i>

33:35.400 --> 33:37.000
<i>We all fall down</i>

33:37.080 --> 33:40.440
<i>And we all get down</i>

33:47.160 --> 33:49.040
Do you remember when we lost Lucas

33:49.600 --> 33:52.000
and I was in that really,
really dark place?

33:52.560 --> 33:53.880
Bounce, mummy, bounce.

33:53.960 --> 33:57.040
Just a minute, Ella, okay?
I'm just gonna talk to Jo.

33:57.800 --> 33:58.960
Look at me, Ella.

33:59.040 --> 34:00.760
Just five minutes, okay?

34:02.480 --> 34:03.440
Yeah.

34:07.960 --> 34:10.080
I have a history
of doing dark things, Cathy.

34:10.160 --> 34:12.200
<i>Ring a ring a roses</i>

34:12.280 --> 34:13.560
<i>A pocket full of posies</i>

34:13.640 --> 34:14.720
<i>A tissue, a tissue</i>

34:14.800 --> 34:16.400
I did something terrible last year.

34:16.480 --> 34:17.760
<i>We all fall down</i>

34:18.400 --> 34:19.400
Hey.

34:19.480 --> 34:20.800
I don't understand.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.560
I don't know
what could have possessed me to.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.080
Mummy!

34:26.960 --> 34:28.720
- Ella it's okay, it's...
- I...

34:30.160 --> 34:31.040
I...

34:31.120 --> 34:32.960
<i>Ring a ring a roses</i>

34:33.040 --> 34:34.400
<i>A pocket full of posies</i>

34:34.480 --> 34:36.800
I think there was something wrong
with me last year.

34:36.880 --> 34:41.600
I found all these tiny
little hidden messages,

34:42.240 --> 34:45.000
saying help to myself
all over my house.

34:45.920 --> 34:49.800
I used to do that when I was a kid,
every time I felt numb.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.080
Listen, I told you before.

34:52.160 --> 34:54.320
You did not fall down
that rabbit hole.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.200
Mummy!

34:55.280 --> 34:57.000
Ella, don't bite your hand.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.120
Okay, sweetheart?

35:00.880 --> 35:05.560
Jo, you arranged
that amazing charity event.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.880
I don't think you were depressed.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.960
The last time I saw you,
you were radiant.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.000
What is it?

35:17.720 --> 35:18.800
Is this about Rob?

35:18.880 --> 35:19.760
Rob?

35:19.840 --> 35:21.880
Christ. Ella it's okay, it's, oh...

35:23.360 --> 35:24.280
Oh, Jesus.

35:25.040 --> 35:25.920
Twice.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.640
Ella, it's okay, it's okay.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.480
Ella, Ella.

35:30.440 --> 35:31.320
Cathy!

35:32.520 --> 35:33.880
What are you not telling me?

35:33.960 --> 35:36.240
- Want some help mum?
- Yes, please.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.320
Do you need some help?

35:43.600 --> 35:45.440
I'm just going to get my bag.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.600
Great night, Mrs. Harding.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.680
Thanks. By the way,

36:03.600 --> 36:06.240
you probably should know
your husband's screwing Anna.

37:00.360 --> 37:02.120
He was fucking someone else

37:02.640 --> 37:04.360
and you didn't tell me?

37:10.240 --> 37:11.520
I suspected, but

37:12.400 --> 37:13.800
I didn't know.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.360
You should have told me.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.840
He denied it.

37:20.440 --> 37:21.280
Jo!

37:22.280 --> 37:24.280
- You should have told me.
- Jo!

37:26.000 --> 37:26.880
Jo!

37:45.280 --> 37:46.160
Where is he?

37:46.920 --> 37:48.880
Oh, I think Mr. Harding's gone home.

37:49.800 --> 37:50.600
He said,

37:51.720 --> 37:53.040
he might finish early today.

37:53.600 --> 37:57.080
He said the secret is
never fall out of love

37:58.040 --> 37:59.080
at the same time.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.640
Very good. Excuse me.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.160
Pru, feeling better?

38:06.240 --> 38:07.160
No.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.160
One of you
has always got to be in love.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.600
How are you, Mrs. Harding?

38:15.960 --> 38:17.400
Uh, excellent.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.640
I'm starting
to remember things now so,

38:21.760 --> 38:23.080
fun times for everyone.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.200
This is where she sits, isn't it?

38:31.120 --> 38:33.680
Where is she? Where's she gone? Anna?

38:36.360 --> 38:37.560
She left last week.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.920
You don't remember
the last time we met, do you?

39:55.200 --> 39:56.080
<i>It's a shame.</i>

40:43.680 --> 40:46.480
Well, well, well. What have we here?

40:46.560 --> 40:47.840
Where's Sash?

40:49.160 --> 40:51.880
She ain't here. Sorry.

40:51.960 --> 40:54.280
I need to tell her something.

40:56.800 --> 40:57.640
Hi there.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.360
Hello, Jo.

41:04.240 --> 41:05.520
I need to talk to you.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.720
You look like you're having
a really bad day, Jo.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.480
I need the bathroom.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.600
Where's the bathroom?

41:21.680 --> 41:22.600
Wrong way.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.000
Just a minute...

41:55.480 --> 41:58.080
I'll get Rob to come
and pick you up, take you home.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.000
Who?

42:01.120 --> 42:01.920
Rob?

42:03.480 --> 42:05.160
Doesn't live here anymore,

42:06.080 --> 42:07.400
as of today.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.520
I'm shedding my skin.

42:13.280 --> 42:15.280
And if you tell my kids...

42:17.600 --> 42:20.440
I'm gonna feed you to the sharks.

42:39.800 --> 42:41.000
I was throwing him out.

42:43.160 --> 42:43.960
Yeah.

42:47.480 --> 42:50.760
I was really looking forward to what
the new year was gonna look like,

42:51.760 --> 42:53.040
was gonna do.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.040
Like having more sex with you.

43:07.600 --> 43:08.560
What?

43:15.640 --> 43:16.920
Are you serious?

43:18.520 --> 43:19.840
You think I'm the sort of man

43:19.920 --> 43:23.000
that would have sex with the mother
of his pregnant girlfriend?

43:25.560 --> 43:28.080
And you're the sort of woman
to go along with that?

43:29.800 --> 43:31.120
No, uh.

43:35.360 --> 43:37.080
Have you been thinking about...?

43:47.320 --> 43:48.480
Oh!

43:50.520 --> 43:52.320
Oh, my god.

43:52.400 --> 43:53.560
Yes!

43:54.360 --> 43:55.800
Yes!

43:59.440 --> 44:01.480
Oh! Yes!

44:13.480 --> 44:15.440
<i>Okay, you fantasised about it.</i>

44:16.000 --> 44:17.120
<i>Not great.</i>

44:18.360 --> 44:19.800
<i>But your fucking husband</i>

44:20.520 --> 44:21.800
<i>went through with it.</i>

44:32.720 --> 44:34.360
<i>What are you gonna do now, Jo?</i>

44:35.120 --> 44:36.560
<i>She's pregnant.</i>

44:37.760 --> 44:39.280
<i>And you knew that.</i>

44:41.400 --> 44:43.760
<i>But did he know you knew?</i>

46:18.600 --> 46:20.840
Get out my fucking house!

47:10.480 --> 47:12.480
