00:21.280 --> 00:22.081
Roofie?

00:22.081 --> 00:23.215
Down here, fool!

00:23.215 --> 00:24.216
Oh, hi...

00:24.216 --> 00:25.885
Uh, who are you?

00:25.885 --> 00:27.153
Who da fuck is you?

00:27.153 --> 00:28.220
I'm the fuck Pac.

00:28.220 --> 00:29.688
I'm Roofie's BFF.

00:29.688 --> 00:30.890
Oh, that's right.

00:30.890 --> 00:31.991
You the medium!

00:31.991 --> 00:33.292
Yes, yes, that I am.

00:33.292 --> 00:35.928
But I'm not also a psychic, so...

00:35.928 --> 00:38.264
How'd you know I was gon' ask that?

00:38.264 --> 00:39.999
I don't know.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.600
Uh, who... who are you again?

00:41.600 --> 00:43.035
I'm Tyson, Roofie's number two guy.

00:43.035 --> 00:44.303
- Got it.
- Roofie's out

00:44.303 --> 00:45.704
reupping with one of his suppliers.

00:45.704 --> 00:46.806
That's cool. You just here

00:46.806 --> 00:47.706
holding down the fortress?

00:47.706 --> 00:48.841
- I dig.
- Nah.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.042
I'm just doing my laundry.

00:50.042 --> 00:51.177
Word. I'm here for a twofer.

00:51.177 --> 00:52.678
- A twofer?
- Yeah.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.013
I need some drugs for my work problem,

00:54.013 --> 00:55.781
and some advice for my girly problem.

00:55.781 --> 00:57.183
You know, having two problems at once

00:57.183 --> 01:00.786
is like, it's hard.

01:00.786 --> 01:01.987
- Come here.
- Yeah, what's up?

01:01.987 --> 01:03.189
Ahh!

01:03.189 --> 01:04.290
Is you kiddin' me with this?

01:04.290 --> 01:05.691
You wanna talk about hard?

01:05.691 --> 01:06.859
You wanna know how hard it is

01:06.859 --> 01:08.661
for me to do what I do?

01:08.661 --> 01:10.296
Look at me!

01:10.296 --> 01:11.897
The one white guy

01:11.897 --> 01:13.799
in Roofie's entire drug operation.

01:13.799 --> 01:16.068
I gotta be smarter, act tougher,

01:16.068 --> 01:18.671
be stronger just to get my respect.

01:18.671 --> 01:19.905
Don't come to me with your

01:19.905 --> 01:20.940
cracker-ass problems!

01:20.940 --> 01:22.141
Oh, shit.

01:22.141 --> 01:23.976
Do I have crackers on my ass again?

01:23.976 --> 01:25.277
How could you even see my ass?

01:25.277 --> 01:26.612
I didn't even turn around.

01:26.612 --> 01:27.646
Motherfucker.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.954
Hello? Hey... hi.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.256
I'm so sorry I'm late;

02:10.256 --> 02:12.057
I had a hard trouble finding the place.

02:12.057 --> 02:13.626
It's an old folks' home today, huh?

02:13.626 --> 02:15.895
Mmm, silly security guard.

02:15.895 --> 02:17.229
My show isn't just about

02:17.229 --> 02:19.131
a gorgeous celebrity medium

02:19.131 --> 02:20.866
making high-paying house calls.

02:20.866 --> 02:23.068
It's also about my extensive charity work!

02:23.068 --> 02:24.203
You do charity work?

02:24.203 --> 02:25.538
Why, yes!

02:25.538 --> 02:27.673
I've always done charity work.

02:27.673 --> 02:29.008
Just because I'm getting paid for this

02:29.008 --> 02:30.142
doesn't mean it's not charity.

02:30.142 --> 02:31.911
- Oh.
- Yeah, good?

02:31.911 --> 02:33.245
It's lovely, thank you.

02:33.245 --> 02:36.048
See you on set. Thank you, darling.

02:36.048 --> 02:37.049
Oh, nice.

02:37.049 --> 02:38.184
Oh, boy.

02:38.184 --> 02:40.019
Listen to me, you little shit.

02:40.019 --> 02:41.554
Nothing can go wrong today.

02:41.554 --> 02:42.988
I've got the president of Alt TV

02:42.988 --> 02:44.023
coming down to set.

02:44.023 --> 02:45.090
You have the president

02:45.090 --> 02:46.759
of all TV coming here?

02:46.759 --> 02:48.260
- Alt TV.
- Oh.

02:48.260 --> 02:49.828
The network that airs my show?

02:49.828 --> 02:50.863
Alt, yeah.

02:50.863 --> 02:52.198
You have one job to do,

02:52.198 --> 02:54.099
and that's to keep yourself and any ghosts

02:54.099 --> 02:55.301
away from me and my cameras.

02:55.301 --> 02:56.735
Mhm.

03:03.075 --> 03:04.877
If that's a ghost,

03:04.877 --> 03:06.111
take care of it.

03:06.111 --> 03:07.513
Yes, ma'am.

03:11.650 --> 03:12.818
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:12.818 --> 03:14.086
Security! Security.

03:14.086 --> 03:15.588
I'm gonna need you to cut it out

03:15.588 --> 03:16.956
with all the haunty stuff, all right?

03:16.956 --> 03:19.258
Well, hot dog! You can see me?

03:19.258 --> 03:21.093
I haven't been seen in nearly sixty years.

03:21.093 --> 03:22.094
Yes, yes. I can see you,

03:22.094 --> 03:23.128
for the love of god.

03:23.128 --> 03:24.196
Now just put down the walker.

03:24.196 --> 03:27.032
Well, not before the big finish.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.067
Ta-da.

03:28.067 --> 03:29.034
Uh-huh.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.102
That was good.

03:30.102 --> 03:34.106
Goddamn made in Taiwan bullshit!

03:34.106 --> 03:35.808
Sing it loud and proud, sister!

03:35.808 --> 03:37.876
U-S-A. What's cookin', copper?

03:37.876 --> 03:39.778
I'm not a copper, I'm... it's security!

03:39.778 --> 03:41.647
God, this shirt doesn't work at all.

03:41.647 --> 03:43.282
You lookin' for a cop?

03:43.282 --> 03:45.284
I... I'm an undercover cop

03:45.284 --> 03:46.685
for over thirty years.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.721
All right, Sid. Keep it down.

03:48.721 --> 03:49.888
We're all trying to watch

03:49.888 --> 03:51.156
Jason's bar mitzvah video.

03:51.156 --> 03:53.259
You gotta get me outta here!

03:53.259 --> 03:56.128
I got intel for the precinct.

03:56.128 --> 03:57.696
- Woah.
- You wanna go

03:57.696 --> 03:59.064
take care of that and I'll stay here?

03:59.064 --> 04:00.833
All right. I'll deal with that later.

04:00.833 --> 04:02.167
Listen, I'm gonna have to
ask you to step outside.

04:02.167 --> 04:03.636
We're shooting a reality show here.

04:03.636 --> 04:05.104
I don't care what kind of picture

04:05.104 --> 04:06.238
you're trying to make,
I'm not going anywhere!

04:06.238 --> 04:07.740
In case you haven't noticed,

04:07.740 --> 04:08.974
I'm quite the Ducky Shincracker...

04:10.676 --> 04:12.177
... and I'm sticking
around for one last dance

04:12.177 --> 04:13.979
with my old swing partner, Edith.

04:13.979 --> 04:15.180
She's still alive, and she lives

04:15.180 --> 04:16.615
right here in this very home.

04:16.615 --> 04:17.916
Okay. So you get your dance...

04:17.916 --> 04:19.151
- ... and you'll scram?
- Why, sure.

04:19.151 --> 04:20.252
So long as we hoof it tonight

04:20.252 --> 04:21.553
in front of the audience

04:21.553 --> 04:22.821
at the weekly talent show.

04:22.821 --> 04:24.757
They have a weekly talent show here?

04:24.757 --> 04:26.725
What can I say, they got a high turnover.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.595
Get me that dance, and I'll steer clear

04:29.595 --> 04:30.929
of your picture, but if not

04:30.929 --> 04:32.798
I'll flip my wig and snap my cap...

04:32.798 --> 04:33.799
That doesn't sound so bad!

04:33.799 --> 04:34.800
Like so.

04:36.101 --> 04:38.237
- Oh.
- Ta-da!

04:38.237 --> 04:42.141
Goddamn made in Korea bullshit!

04:42.141 --> 04:43.275
Yeah.

04:43.275 --> 04:44.877
I love messing with that guy.

04:47.946 --> 04:50.115
You may enter!

04:50.115 --> 04:51.250
That's my Edith.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.718
Quite the dame!

04:52.718 --> 04:54.286
Uhhh... hello.

04:54.286 --> 04:56.555
Good morrow to you, dame Ednith.

04:56.555 --> 04:57.990
I am Kevin Pacalioglu.

04:57.990 --> 04:59.325
Oh, my.

04:59.325 --> 05:01.160
Aren't you a round drink of water?

05:01.160 --> 05:02.828
What can I do for you, Kevin?

05:02.828 --> 05:04.296
Uh, well, I'm a medium,

05:04.296 --> 05:06.832
and I happened to meet a ghost here today

05:06.832 --> 05:07.933
who would like very much

05:07.933 --> 05:09.568
to have one last dance with you

05:09.568 --> 05:10.936
at tonight's talent show.

05:10.936 --> 05:13.172
He's quite the Dicky Schumacher.

05:13.172 --> 05:18.544
Ah, Edith Jane does not
just dance with anyone.

05:18.544 --> 05:21.513
I had a partner, many years ago,

05:21.513 --> 05:24.049
who dropped me once mid-dance.

05:24.049 --> 05:25.517
- What?
- Broke my hip.

05:25.517 --> 05:27.186
I thought I'd never dance again!

05:27.186 --> 05:28.854
Tell her it's Fred Myers.

05:28.854 --> 05:30.055
Oh, he says,

05:30.055 --> 05:31.557
"Tell her it's Fred Myers."

05:31.557 --> 05:32.858
- Fred Myers?
- Yeah!

05:32.858 --> 05:36.662
I'd dance any night of the week with Fred.

05:36.662 --> 05:37.896
Good, great.

05:37.896 --> 05:39.832
But I mean, specifically tonight.

05:39.832 --> 05:40.899
Fred!

05:40.899 --> 05:42.267
Pull me out of the dark,

05:42.267 --> 05:44.770
put me back on my feet, the very feet

05:44.770 --> 05:48.207
that danced on the Great White Way.

05:48.207 --> 05:50.776
I owe him my life.

05:50.776 --> 05:52.177
It would be an honor

05:52.177 --> 05:54.780
to have a last dance with Fred.

05:54.780 --> 05:56.682
- Good.
- If you'd be so kind

05:56.682 --> 05:59.685
as to hand me my wheelchair please?

05:59.685 --> 06:00.786
Your wheelchair?

06:00.786 --> 06:02.054
- Yes.
- Huh.

06:02.054 --> 06:04.523
Uh, ow. Ow!

06:08.093 --> 06:10.162
It feels worse than it looks.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.196
Ah!

06:16.034 --> 06:18.604
Ow, ahh, oh, ahh!

06:20.005 --> 06:22.241
All right, I'm thinking
we got enough foot ju...

06:22.241 --> 06:23.675
enough foot juice.

06:23.675 --> 06:24.543
Your thoughts?

06:24.543 --> 06:26.111
Ah!

06:26.111 --> 06:27.312
At this point, I don't think

06:27.312 --> 06:30.649
I can stand, let alone dance.

06:30.649 --> 06:34.253
But if these gams can save Fred's soul,

06:34.253 --> 06:35.954
I'm gonna keep trying.

06:35.954 --> 06:37.990
That's... that's actually really sweet.

06:37.990 --> 06:39.158
Oh!

06:39.158 --> 06:40.125
Ew, ew, ew!

06:40.125 --> 06:42.227
Ew, ew, oh, ew!

06:42.227 --> 06:43.228
Okay!

06:43.228 --> 06:44.229
Take ten.

06:44.229 --> 06:45.197
Take ten, everybody!

06:45.197 --> 06:46.165
Take ten!

06:46.165 --> 06:47.733
Ew, ew, ew!

06:49.501 --> 06:50.769
Woah, woah. Pac, Pac, Pac.

06:50.769 --> 06:51.971
- Woah, woah!
- Woah, Roofie!

06:51.971 --> 06:53.439
Yes, thank God you're here!

06:53.439 --> 06:54.440
You got something on your face, man.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.474
What is that?

06:55.474 --> 06:56.542
What are you doing here?

06:56.542 --> 06:57.676
Wait a minute, did Tyson

06:57.676 --> 06:58.777
tell you I was gonna be here?

06:58.777 --> 06:59.778
Wait a minute, did I tell Tyson

06:59.778 --> 07:00.713
I was gonna be here?

07:00.713 --> 07:01.647
Is Tyson real?

07:01.647 --> 07:02.881
Look, chill, Pac.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.383
I'm here to see my Nana.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.951
- 'Sup, Pac.
- Hey, 'sup, Nana.

07:05.951 --> 07:07.686
Hey, man, listen. You
gotta keep it down, right?

07:07.686 --> 07:10.055
There's a lot of drugs
in this place, all right?

07:10.055 --> 07:11.824
Nana's my connect, all right?

07:11.824 --> 07:13.392
- Cracker?
- No, no, thank you.

07:13.392 --> 07:14.727
They just get all over my ass.

07:14.727 --> 07:16.061
Time out, wait, what are you doing here?

07:16.061 --> 07:17.563
Oh, Camomile's shooting here today,

07:17.563 --> 07:18.931
and I got this ghost who wants to dance

07:18.931 --> 07:20.532
with this old lady, but
she's got this, like,

07:20.532 --> 07:22.868
black, crusty, puss-filled swollen foot!

07:22.868 --> 07:24.470
I don't think she's gonna be able to dance,

07:24.470 --> 07:25.771
I don't want to piss off the ghost,

07:25.771 --> 07:26.972
so I've been pussyfooting around

07:26.972 --> 07:28.474
her pussy foot issue all day.

07:28.474 --> 07:29.975
Uh, dude, let me stop you

07:29.975 --> 07:31.543
right there before I throw up.

07:31.543 --> 07:32.945
Hey, I got something that can help.

07:32.945 --> 07:35.547
- Oh, really?
- Check this out.

07:35.547 --> 07:37.049
Tell her to pop a couple of these.

07:37.049 --> 07:39.518
What is it?

07:39.518 --> 07:42.821
It's a non-FDA approved
drug called Cinderella.

07:42.821 --> 07:45.724
- Nice.
- It helps with the pain and the swelling.

07:45.724 --> 07:47.493
Girls pop them in the club all the time

07:47.493 --> 07:50.562
so they can dance all night
in their heels pain-free.

07:50.562 --> 07:53.399
Just like the fairytale.

07:53.399 --> 07:55.501
Nothing like the fairytale.

07:57.503 --> 07:59.004
Dottie, someone... someone

07:59.004 --> 08:01.640
is desperately trying to reach you.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.610
It's, um...

08:04.610 --> 08:06.078
it's a man.

08:09.748 --> 08:12.584
His name is

08:12.584 --> 08:13.986
G... Gil...

08:13.986 --> 08:15.454
No, not Gordon.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.423
Gil...

08:20.025 --> 08:23.962
Gilbert Benjamin?

08:23.962 --> 08:26.065
Does that ring a bell?

08:26.065 --> 08:27.633
Sure.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.768
Was he important to you?

08:29.768 --> 08:31.837
My husband Gil?

08:31.837 --> 08:34.640
Sure.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.041
He wants you to know,

08:36.041 --> 08:39.078
he loves you very much.

08:39.078 --> 08:40.511
Phenomenal.

08:40.511 --> 08:42.414
Tell him I said hi.

08:42.414 --> 08:44.850
Now can I go take a nap, please?

08:44.850 --> 08:48.487
And cut.

08:48.487 --> 08:51.557
Thank you so much, Dottie.

08:51.557 --> 08:54.727
You've been a big bitch.

08:54.727 --> 08:56.028
Ah, there she is!

08:56.028 --> 08:57.796
Alt TV's Brittiest star!

08:57.796 --> 08:59.398
You see what I did there? Eh?

08:59.398 --> 09:00.966
I made "prettiest" and "British"

09:00.966 --> 09:02.935
one word, so it's clever,

09:02.935 --> 09:04.603
and not sexual harassment.

09:04.603 --> 09:05.738
Oh, Barrold!

09:05.738 --> 09:06.939
Call me Barry.

09:06.939 --> 09:08.340
Barry Weinbergerstein.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.842
Oh, Barry! I'm so glad

09:09.842 --> 09:11.443
you could make it down to set today.

09:11.443 --> 09:12.611
Please, please.

09:12.611 --> 09:14.113
The pressure's all mine.

09:14.113 --> 09:17.316
I need this show to do well, Ms. White.

09:17.316 --> 09:18.717
Alt TV has been getting killed

09:18.717 --> 09:20.452
in the ratings by every network.

09:20.452 --> 09:22.955
You're doing worse than
every other network?

09:22.955 --> 09:25.023
No, just our rival, Every Network.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.492
- EN.
- Ohhh.

09:26.492 --> 09:28.026
The point is, we're counting

09:28.026 --> 09:29.661
on Midtown Manhattan Medium

09:29.661 --> 09:32.097
to inject a little bit of...

09:32.097 --> 09:34.032
a little life into the line-up.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.902
Don't you worry, Barry.

09:36.902 --> 09:41.140
I predict huge ratings for this show.

09:41.140 --> 09:42.574
- I'm not worried.
- No?

09:44.710 --> 09:46.678
If the show stinks, we'll just cancel it

09:46.678 --> 09:49.681
before it airs, and save some money.

09:49.681 --> 09:50.816
Okay!

09:50.816 --> 09:53.018
I'm gonna hit the head.

09:53.018 --> 09:54.453
Okay, so,

09:54.453 --> 09:56.889
does the carpet match the drapes?

09:56.889 --> 09:58.323
You know, I mean, do your legs

09:58.323 --> 10:00.092
feel as okay as they look?

10:00.092 --> 10:02.528
Ow, ow, ah, ow!

10:09.968 --> 10:12.404
Sorry, force of habit.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.106
I feel great!

10:14.106 --> 10:17.709
Ba-di-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, baaa!

10:18.777 --> 10:20.546
That is some good shit.

10:20.546 --> 10:21.980
Yeah, let's dance!

10:24.716 --> 10:25.684
You ready for this?

10:25.684 --> 10:26.718
Bend your knees, fatty.

10:26.718 --> 10:27.653
Here we go.

10:27.653 --> 10:28.554
Ba-da ba!

10:28.554 --> 10:29.655
Now you.

10:29.655 --> 10:31.023
5-6-7-8!

10:31.023 --> 10:32.524
Ba-da-ba!

10:32.524 --> 10:33.459
Okay!

10:33.459 --> 10:34.827
Ba-da-ba-ba!

10:34.827 --> 10:37.062
Okay, now you're cookin' with gas!

10:37.729 --> 10:38.964
Oh, oh!

10:38.964 --> 10:40.532
If they can teach a bear to ride a bicycle,

10:40.532 --> 10:41.633
I can teach you how to dance. Here we go.

10:41.633 --> 10:43.435
5-6-7-8.

10:44.870 --> 10:46.939
You are a burly piece of work, sir.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.073
Throw in a little flair, right?

10:48.073 --> 10:49.608
Ba-ba-ba-ba!

10:49.608 --> 10:50.609
Please.

10:51.944 --> 10:53.846
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

10:53.846 --> 10:55.514
No, no, take five!

10:55.514 --> 10:56.815
I don't want to take five!

10:56.815 --> 10:58.650
She's never gonna get this. Okay.

11:00.319 --> 11:01.787
Oh, my God.

11:04.423 --> 11:06.492
Your husband is dead...

11:13.632 --> 11:15.400
Open the door, open
the door, open the door!

11:15.400 --> 11:17.436
Yeah, now give me some sass.

11:18.837 --> 11:20.372
Shakin' boobies.

11:25.878 --> 11:26.912
Oh!

11:29.915 --> 11:31.817
And now for the kicker!

11:34.263 --> 11:35.764
What the hell is going on in here?

11:35.764 --> 11:37.299
You told me to distract the ghost

11:37.299 --> 11:38.634
while you did your TV show!

11:38.634 --> 11:40.269
Well now you've distracted everyone.

11:40.269 --> 11:41.570
- So there is no show!
- I don't know

11:41.570 --> 11:42.938
what those people are doing out there!

11:42.938 --> 11:44.373
I'm just... I'm just training a ghost

11:44.373 --> 11:45.741
and his dame for the talent show!

11:45.741 --> 11:47.543
- What?
- Woah, woah, woah, woah.

11:47.543 --> 11:49.411
A show involving ghosts?

11:49.411 --> 11:51.313
And talent? And dames?

11:51.313 --> 11:52.915
That sounds like an exciting

11:52.915 --> 11:54.650
and sexy and spooky

11:54.650 --> 11:57.653
third act set piece for this episode!

11:57.653 --> 11:59.922
Of Midtown Manhattan Medium.

11:59.922 --> 12:01.390
But what do I know?

12:01.390 --> 12:02.758
I'm just the president of Alt TV!

12:02.758 --> 12:03.892
Barrold!

12:03.892 --> 12:05.727
Barry! Barry Weinbergerstein.

12:05.727 --> 12:07.563
You must be psychic.

12:07.563 --> 12:09.264
That was exactly what I was planning to do.

12:09.264 --> 12:10.732
Great minds think alike, huh?

12:10.732 --> 12:12.801
Ms. White, you continue to impress me.

12:12.801 --> 12:14.369
Thank you, Barry.

12:14.369 --> 12:16.738
All right, I'm gonna go hit the head.

12:16.738 --> 12:18.807
Bye.

12:18.807 --> 12:19.942
Owiee!

12:19.942 --> 12:21.477
You had one job to do

12:21.477 --> 12:22.845
and that was to keep ghosts off the set,

12:22.845 --> 12:24.580
and you managed to do the exact opposite!

12:24.580 --> 12:26.348
Yeah, but my heart was in the right place?

12:26.348 --> 12:27.749
Lucky for you, you know, I know

12:27.749 --> 12:29.017
exactly how to spin this.

12:29.017 --> 12:30.719
I'm just gonna...

12:30.719 --> 12:32.621
I'm just gonna slip into something sparkly

12:32.621 --> 12:33.822
and host the talent show myself.

12:33.822 --> 12:35.591
And then I'll channel a couple

12:35.591 --> 12:37.793
of former residents to be ghost judges!

12:37.793 --> 12:40.496
Can I be in charge of the prizes?

12:40.496 --> 12:42.865
You can be in charge of one thing,

12:42.865 --> 12:45.667
and one thing only:

12:45.667 --> 12:47.436
making sure this ghost dance

12:47.436 --> 12:48.871
goes off without a hitch.

12:48.871 --> 12:49.972
Yeah.

12:49.972 --> 12:51.473
Boy, she seems like a real

12:51.473 --> 12:53.408
see-you-next-Tuesday-on-a-Wednesday.

12:53.408 --> 12:54.409
I'd still hit it, though,

12:54.409 --> 12:55.544
don't get me wrong.

13:02.235 --> 13:04.538
Welcome to the Leaky Springs

13:04.538 --> 13:07.474
Retirement Community Talent Show!

13:09.109 --> 13:12.012
Tonight, our residents use their talents

13:12.012 --> 13:15.549
to win your hearts and impress our judges.

13:15.549 --> 13:19.019
Let's meet our panel of experts now.

13:19.019 --> 13:22.489
Please welcome two
recently deceased members

13:22.489 --> 13:25.091
of the Leaky Springs community,

13:25.091 --> 13:27.327
the ghosts of Gilbert Benjamin

13:27.327 --> 13:30.063
and Rose Bailey!

13:32.365 --> 13:36.136
And, as the star of
Midtown Manhattan Medium,

13:36.136 --> 13:37.270
I'll be rounding off

13:37.270 --> 13:38.939
your judging panel tonight.

13:38.939 --> 13:41.141
It's me, Camomile White!

13:42.409 --> 13:43.610
Okay, okay, guys.

13:43.610 --> 13:44.611
Everyone feeling all right?

13:44.611 --> 13:45.645
Need anything?

13:45.645 --> 13:47.113
Need some pills, ointment, huh?

13:47.113 --> 13:48.248
Large-font reading material?

13:48.248 --> 13:49.683
Cool it there, eager-beaver.

13:49.683 --> 13:51.651
Our dance is gonna be killer-diller.

13:51.651 --> 13:53.019
I'll take some ointment.

13:53.019 --> 13:54.221
Yes, yes. 'Cause the dance

13:54.221 --> 13:55.555
has got to be perfect.

13:55.555 --> 13:56.957
Not to worry. We're prepared.

13:56.957 --> 13:58.091
We haven't been rehearsing

13:58.091 --> 14:00.093
all mid-to-late afternoon for nothing.

14:00.093 --> 14:01.294
Good, fantastic.

14:01.294 --> 14:03.063
Though, there is one thing

14:03.063 --> 14:04.431
we're not prepared for.

14:04.431 --> 14:07.567
- What's that?
- The big lift at the end of the dance.

14:07.567 --> 14:09.236
That limey hussy out there

14:09.236 --> 14:10.604
stopped our rehearsal
before we had a chance

14:10.604 --> 14:12.205
to give it a whirl.

14:12.205 --> 14:13.607
Okay, well, I'm not taking any chances.

14:13.607 --> 14:15.141
We gotta practice that
big lift at least once

14:15.141 --> 14:16.243
before we get out there, right?

14:16.243 --> 14:17.344
Let's do it, chop-chop.

14:17.344 --> 14:19.012
All right.

14:21.114 --> 14:23.416
All right. Ha! Ha! Ha!

14:28.455 --> 14:30.056
Oh! Oh, my god!

14:30.056 --> 14:31.558
Do you see what I mean now?

14:31.558 --> 14:33.093
If that had to happen on stage,

14:33.093 --> 14:35.262
that would have been a disaster!

14:35.262 --> 14:36.129
Get her up.

14:36.129 --> 14:39.132
Edith, Edith?

14:39.132 --> 14:40.600
Edith, honey?

14:42.435 --> 14:43.637
Herro?

14:43.637 --> 14:46.673
♪ What I wouldn't do ♪

14:46.673 --> 14:50.644
♪ for love ♪

14:55.148 --> 14:56.449
Well, they used to love it

14:56.449 --> 14:58.084
down at the precinct.

14:58.084 --> 15:00.120
Hey, come on!

15:00.120 --> 15:01.388
I... I think I got

15:01.388 --> 15:03.623
a little crick in my neck.

15:03.623 --> 15:05.258
Uh, actually...

15:05.258 --> 15:06.459
You're dead.

15:06.459 --> 15:08.128
Oh...

15:08.128 --> 15:10.530
Horsefeathers.

15:10.530 --> 15:13.133
I'm sorry to let you down...

15:13.133 --> 15:14.234
Milton?

15:14.234 --> 15:16.136
Who's Milton?

15:34.421 --> 15:36.089
My first partner.

15:36.089 --> 15:38.124
The son of a bitch who dropped me.

15:38.124 --> 15:40.026
All because he was a weak lifter!

15:40.026 --> 15:41.461
I wasn't a weak lifter.

15:41.461 --> 15:42.629
You were a weight shifter!

15:42.629 --> 15:43.930
And you still are!

15:43.930 --> 15:45.231
- Weak lifter!
- Weight shifter!

15:45.231 --> 15:47.534
- Weak lifter!
- Weight shifter!

15:50.470 --> 15:53.540
Those lights are a sign
from Gilbert and Rose.

15:53.540 --> 15:56.609
You really got a rise out of them!

15:58.244 --> 15:59.546
Okay, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, guys!

15:59.546 --> 16:01.247
Guys, hold on! Guys, stop fighting.

16:01.247 --> 16:02.382
Don't you see? You're both dead.

16:02.382 --> 16:03.917
You can see each other now.

16:03.917 --> 16:05.518
Dancing is going to be super duper easy.

16:05.518 --> 16:08.488
Dance with him over my dead body!

16:08.488 --> 16:10.090
Oh yeah, I mean, I guess we could,

16:10.090 --> 16:11.424
like, move it onto the stage?

16:11.424 --> 16:12.926
What are you so scared of?

16:12.926 --> 16:14.160
That this will prove once and for all

16:14.160 --> 16:15.595
that this was your fault?

16:15.595 --> 16:19.065
That's all the proof I need, weak lifter!

16:19.065 --> 16:21.901
Exit stage, I'm right!

16:24.892 --> 16:26.026
Horsefeathers!

16:26.026 --> 16:27.094
I've been waiting around

16:27.094 --> 16:28.695
60 years to do that lift

16:28.695 --> 16:30.397
so I could prove I wasn't a weak lifter!

16:30.397 --> 16:32.566
Now I'll never finish
my unfinished beeswax.

16:32.566 --> 16:35.736
Okay, so we're cool, then?

16:35.736 --> 16:37.938
If I'm not performing tonight,

16:37.938 --> 16:39.473
no one is.

16:41.541 --> 16:43.577
Up the pole,

16:43.577 --> 16:45.846
down the pole,

16:45.846 --> 16:48.215
Astroglide,

16:48.215 --> 16:49.983
any hole!

16:49.983 --> 16:52.052
I love that dirty slut!

16:52.052 --> 16:54.655
That's why I trust her butt!

16:57.524 --> 16:58.558
Holla!

16:58.558 --> 16:59.593
Ah.

16:59.593 --> 17:00.827
Uh, hey, Milt. Milton, listen.

17:00.827 --> 17:01.995
Calm down, listen, buddy!

17:01.995 --> 17:03.530
Listen, you know, Edith,

17:03.530 --> 17:05.132
she probably would have shifted her weight

17:05.132 --> 17:06.599
no matter what you did, man.

17:06.599 --> 17:07.968
Once... once a filthy weight shifter,

17:07.968 --> 17:09.903
always a filthy weight shifter, right?

17:09.903 --> 17:11.038
Yeah!

17:11.038 --> 17:12.638
- You really think so?
- I do!

17:12.638 --> 17:13.773
As a matter of fact, I don't think

17:13.773 --> 17:14.942
you need to waste your time

17:14.942 --> 17:16.076
trying to impress that dame.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.444
You got nothing to prove to her!

17:17.444 --> 17:18.612
- You're right!
- Actually,

17:18.612 --> 17:19.913
don't you think maybe you need

17:19.913 --> 17:21.982
to prove it to somebody else?

17:21.982 --> 17:23.550
You know what?

17:23.550 --> 17:25.185
You're right, fatso!

17:25.185 --> 17:26.954
I need to prove it to myself!

17:26.954 --> 17:28.488
Ye... Oh, yeah! That's, yeah,

17:28.488 --> 17:29.690
way better than what I was gonna say.

17:29.690 --> 17:30.724
But how?

17:30.724 --> 17:32.025
I'm down a dance partner.

17:32.025 --> 17:33.093
Milty? Hello?

17:33.093 --> 17:34.428
You forgetting something?

17:34.428 --> 17:35.562
I trained you guys.

17:35.562 --> 17:36.797
I taught you the routines.

17:36.797 --> 17:38.699
I can totally train someone else.

17:38.699 --> 17:41.735
Or...

17:41.735 --> 17:43.537
ta-da!

17:43.537 --> 17:44.638
Oh boy.

17:44.638 --> 17:45.906
If I can successfully lift

17:45.906 --> 17:47.641
your pear-shaped, jalopy body,

17:47.641 --> 17:49.576
I'll prove to everyone for once and for all

17:49.576 --> 17:51.011
that I'm not a weak lifter!

17:51.011 --> 17:52.879
I stand by my "Oh boy."

17:52.879 --> 17:55.615
Now it's time for a very special treat

17:55.615 --> 17:57.551
on the Leaky Springs Stage.

17:57.551 --> 18:00.520
Please welcome legendary Broadway dancer

18:00.520 --> 18:01.688
Edith Jane,

18:01.688 --> 18:03.590
with her former dance partner

18:03.590 --> 18:07.027
and current ghost, Fred Myers!

18:53.106 --> 18:54.508
Ah, it worked,

18:54.508 --> 18:56.143
you magnificent son-of-a-bitch!

18:56.143 --> 18:57.210
It worked!

19:01.148 --> 19:02.049
Oh!

19:03.550 --> 19:07.120
Oh, ow, ow!

19:07.120 --> 19:08.655
That's a man!

19:08.655 --> 19:09.990
Owww, my dick.

19:12.092 --> 19:13.894
So you think you can dance?

19:13.894 --> 19:15.929
If you ever pull a stunt
like that, I will...

19:15.929 --> 19:18.465
I will order two more seasons!

19:18.465 --> 19:19.633
Barry Weinbergerstein,

19:19.633 --> 19:20.801
president of Alt TV.

19:20.801 --> 19:22.202
What you just did out there

19:22.202 --> 19:24.538
is gonna be the most exciting episode

19:24.538 --> 19:26.173
of TV since Maude

19:26.173 --> 19:28.575
had an abortion on Maude.

19:28.575 --> 19:30.944
Do you remember when she had the abortion?

19:32.879 --> 19:34.481
That was a good one. Listen.

19:34.481 --> 19:36.116
I just love the new, fun direction

19:36.116 --> 19:37.584
you're taking the show.

19:37.584 --> 19:39.219
A comedic take on the medium genre.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.754
- It's pure genius.
- Thank you, Barry.

19:40.754 --> 19:42.122
I just knew you'd love it!

19:42.122 --> 19:44.825
All right. I've got two words for you:

19:44.825 --> 19:47.727
Nichols. May.

19:47.727 --> 19:49.729
So, what you're saying is...

19:49.729 --> 19:51.164
Camomile White, say hello

19:51.164 --> 19:52.799
to your new partner.

19:52.799 --> 19:54.000
The beautiful medium,

19:54.000 --> 19:55.602
and her bumbling security guard.

19:55.602 --> 19:56.837
It's ratings gold!

19:56.837 --> 19:57.704
Or...

19:57.704 --> 20:00.440
Or, what?

20:00.440 --> 20:03.510
The psychic and her sidekick?

20:03.510 --> 20:04.845
Boom!

20:04.845 --> 20:07.114
Camomile, you're blowing my mind.

20:07.114 --> 20:08.615
Thank you, Barry.

20:08.615 --> 20:10.083
I'm so pleased you share my vision.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.119
That was actually what today was all about.

20:12.119 --> 20:13.653
It was really to prove to you

20:13.653 --> 20:15.155
that this dynamic works.

20:15.155 --> 20:16.990
Yeah.

20:16.990 --> 20:19.126
Well, I should get back to the office.

20:19.126 --> 20:20.994
Alt TV is not gonna president itself,

20:20.994 --> 20:22.162
you know?

20:22.162 --> 20:24.965
Look out, Every Network!

20:24.965 --> 20:26.600
I know... I know you're upset right now,

20:26.600 --> 20:28.468
but listen to me, one quick question:

20:28.468 --> 20:29.970
am I in charge of moving this,

20:29.970 --> 20:32.439
or is that like a union thing?

20:32.439 --> 20:33.473
No, no, no!

20:46.493 --> 20:47.861
Hi.

20:47.861 --> 20:48.995
Hey.

20:49.085 --> 20:50.987
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

20:50.987 --> 20:53.923
It was a really crazy day at the newsstand.

20:56.126 --> 20:57.761
So, listen, I know that

20:57.761 --> 20:59.996
I've been really neglectifying you lately,

20:59.996 --> 21:01.298
and I... I'd really like the chance

21:01.298 --> 21:02.966
to change that, if I can.

21:08.972 --> 21:11.007
May I have this dance?

21:20.050 --> 21:21.951
Where'd you learn to dance like this?

21:21.951 --> 21:24.187
Just some guy named Fred.

21:24.187 --> 21:25.588
I mean, Milton.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.023
Some guy named Milton.
