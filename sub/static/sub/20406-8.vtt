<i>(Male announcer)
Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.723 --> 00:05.991
<i>Chef Ramsay announced
a special event.</i>

00:06.069 --> 00:07.636
Their fiftieth wedding anniversary.

00:07.704 --> 00:08.804
<i>(Announcer)
In the challenge,</i>

00:08.872 --> 00:10.472
<i>the chefs were tested
on updating</i>

00:10.540 --> 00:12.174
<i>the couple's
original wedding menu.</i>

00:12.742 --> 00:13.608
How you guys feeling
the chicken?

00:13.676 --> 00:15.310
We probably have five minutes.

00:15.378 --> 00:16.812
<i>(Announcer) Ben took control
of his new team.</i>

00:16.879 --> 00:18.046
If you put
the bread crumbs on now,

00:18.114 --> 00:19.414
the tuna'll brown
before it's cooked inside.

00:19.482 --> 00:20.549
(Fran)
Okay.

00:20.616 --> 00:21.883
Benjamin was definitely
our leader.

00:21.951 --> 00:24.453
There was, like,
this calmness.

00:24.520 --> 00:25.587
<i>(Announcer)
And when it came time</i>

00:25.655 --> 00:27.456
<i>to show what he was made of...</i>

00:27.523 --> 00:28.690
They're both very good dishes.

00:28.758 --> 00:30.025
<i>(Announcer)
Ben clinched the victory</i>

00:30.093 --> 00:31.226
for the red team.

00:31.294 --> 00:32.861
(Gordon)
The edge is in the red team.

00:32.929 --> 00:34.629
- Thank you, Chef.
- Ben is [bleep] dope.

00:34.697 --> 00:35.997
(Nilka)
The tables have turned.

00:36.065 --> 00:37.599
<i>(Announcer)
But at the anniversary dinner,</i>

00:37.667 --> 00:39.768
<i>Ben was cocky.</i>

00:39.836 --> 00:41.870
<i>And Chef Ramsay
was disappointed.</i>

00:41.938 --> 00:43.205
- Benjamin!
- Yes, Chef.

00:43.272 --> 00:44.373
(Gordon)
They've all gone to [bleep]

00:44.440 --> 00:45.607
burned [bleep] [bleep].

00:45.675 --> 00:47.109
(Ben)
I screwed up the crab cakes.

00:47.176 --> 00:48.877
Chef Ramsay's screaming
and yelling at me.

00:48.945 --> 00:50.746
- Come on, Benjamin!
- I mean, it's embarrassing.

00:50.813 --> 00:51.913
When it's brown,
it's cooked.

00:51.981 --> 00:53.648
When it's black,
it's [bleep].

00:53.716 --> 00:55.016
<i>(Announcer)
In the blue kitchen...</i>

00:55.084 --> 00:56.251
Salvatore, you got to talk
to me, buddy.

00:56.319 --> 00:57.419
Come on!

00:57.487 --> 00:58.453
<i>(Announcer)
Salvatore was lost</i>

00:58.521 --> 00:59.388
<i>on garnish.</i>
[bleep].

00:59.455 --> 01:00.789
When Sal gets flustered,

01:00.857 --> 01:02.524
his brain shuts down.

01:02.592 --> 01:03.792
(Gordon)
Come on, Salvatore!

01:03.860 --> 01:04.992
I'm getting sick of this.

01:05.061 --> 01:06.895
<i>(Announcer)
The red team lost</i>

01:06.963 --> 01:08.397
<i>- and nominated...</i>
- Fran, Chef.

01:08.464 --> 01:09.531
<i>(Announcer) and...</i>
- Siobhan.

01:09.599 --> 01:10.699
<i>(Announcer)
And Ben was not shy</i>

01:10.767 --> 01:11.867
<i>about giving his opinion.</i>

01:11.934 --> 01:13.935
Siobhan lacks experience

01:14.003 --> 01:15.137
or passion for food.

01:15.204 --> 01:16.138
<i>(Announcer)
But Chef Ramsay</i>

01:16.205 --> 01:18.073
<i>had another idea.</i>

01:18.141 --> 01:19.241
(Gordon)
There is one Chef

01:19.308 --> 01:20.575
that had the worst service.

01:20.643 --> 01:21.877
Salvatore.

01:21.944 --> 01:22.811
<i>(Announcer)
And even though Salvatore</i>

01:22.879 --> 01:24.079
<i>was not on the losing team,</i>

01:24.147 --> 01:26.381
<i>Chef Ramsay ended his dream</i>

<i>of becoming head chef
at the Savoy in London.</i>

02:34.105 --> 02:35.605
Get out.
Good night.

02:35.673 --> 02:37.273
(All)
Good night, Chef.

02:44.782 --> 02:47.417
From this day on,
you have to stop talking

02:47.485 --> 02:49.886
and just work.

02:49.954 --> 02:51.154
Yeah, you're
not very technical.

02:51.222 --> 02:52.255
I don't see
the passion.

02:52.323 --> 02:53.990
(Siobhan)
You know what, Ben?

02:54.058 --> 02:56.526
I wouldn't be sitting here if
I didn't have [bleep] passion.

02:56.594 --> 02:57.861
So he can go [bleep] himself.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.362
Would you guys say that you know
what's going on

02:59.430 --> 03:00.964
with service
if something's easy?

03:01.031 --> 03:02.265
(Ben) I don't want
to hear the word easy

03:02.333 --> 03:03.933
out of anybody
on the red team's mouth.

03:04.001 --> 03:05.835
I'm ready to put
my [bleep] weight on the line.

03:05.903 --> 03:08.538
I ain't turning back.

03:08.606 --> 03:09.973
Ben, wait
till that next challenge.

03:10.040 --> 03:10.974
You haven't seen the fire
in my eyes.

03:11.041 --> 03:12.542
Well, guess what?

03:12.610 --> 03:15.712
Next time, I'll cook your ass
under the table,

03:15.780 --> 03:16.913
and I'll prove to you

03:16.981 --> 03:17.914
that I'm a good cook.

03:19.283 --> 03:20.917
[sighs]

03:20.985 --> 03:21.918
(Ben) We could have done
so much better.

03:21.986 --> 03:23.086
Like... like
with Siobhan.

03:23.154 --> 03:24.621
She's not passionate
or technical.

03:24.688 --> 03:26.389
And she talks
so [bleep] much.

03:26.457 --> 03:28.925
It's, like,
people say it's easy.

03:28.993 --> 03:29.959
Like, with Siobhan,
"I understand. I understand."

03:30.027 --> 03:31.361
Shut the [bleep] up.

03:31.429 --> 03:32.228
"You don't understand
anything."

03:32.296 --> 03:34.097
You're lucky to be here.

03:34.165 --> 03:35.532
He's just being
so [bleep] negative.

03:35.599 --> 03:37.367
You may be a great cook,

03:37.435 --> 03:38.368
but don't be rude.

03:38.436 --> 03:39.436
Siobhan's going to go...

Benjamin speaking.

03:52.917 --> 03:54.350
Benjamin, Chef Ramsay
will be taking you guys

03:54.418 --> 03:57.020
to one of L.A.'s oldest and most
famous French restaurants.

03:57.087 --> 03:58.154
So I need everyone up.

03:58.222 --> 04:00.824
Yes, Chef.
We have to wake up.

04:00.891 --> 04:03.526
(Autumn) I'm excited
to be getting out of here,

04:03.594 --> 04:05.562
get pretty,
smell good.

04:05.629 --> 04:08.698
No real heel, so if I have
to cook, I can cook.

04:08.766 --> 04:09.766
Or if I have to run,
I can run.

04:09.834 --> 04:12.101
I have no idea
what's happening.

04:19.577 --> 04:21.043
Let's go.

04:23.681 --> 04:25.448
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Chef.

04:25.516 --> 04:27.784
Why are you looking
so smart?

04:27.852 --> 04:29.652
There was sawdust
on the floors.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.689
It was all old
and rustic,

04:32.756 --> 04:34.390
and Chef Ramsay
was looking at us

04:34.458 --> 04:36.493
like we were stupid,
so overdressed.

04:36.560 --> 04:37.494
First of all,
welcome to Philippe's.

04:37.561 --> 04:39.095
This restaurant has been here

04:39.163 --> 04:40.964
for over a hundred years.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.166
(All)
Wow.

04:43.234 --> 04:46.636
This restaurant is the birth
place of the French Dip.

04:46.704 --> 04:48.304
I had no idea
that the French Dip sandwich

04:48.372 --> 04:50.306
originated there.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.575
I actually didn't know that Los
Angeles was noted for anything.

04:52.643 --> 04:54.244
Let me introduce you
to someone very, very special.

04:54.311 --> 04:55.178
Richard Binder,
come on.

04:55.246 --> 04:56.312
How are you, sir?

04:56.380 --> 04:57.380
- Fine, Chef. How are you?
- Good to see you.

04:57.448 --> 04:59.849
The legendary French Dip
started how?

04:59.917 --> 05:00.850
Quite by accident.

05:00.918 --> 05:02.986
Philippe was making
a sandwich,

05:03.053 --> 05:06.089
and he actually dropped the roll
into the pan of gravy.

05:06.156 --> 05:08.591
And the customer says,
"I'll take it that way."

05:08.659 --> 05:10.493
So that's kind of the start
of the French Dip sandwich.

05:10.561 --> 05:13.363
Let's go find out what exactly
made this restaurant famous

05:13.430 --> 05:14.430
all over the world,
yes?

05:14.498 --> 05:15.398
(All)
Yes, Chef.

05:15.466 --> 05:16.299
- Let's go.
- Great.

05:16.367 --> 05:17.400
Chef Ramsay was such a delight.

05:17.468 --> 05:18.735
I even had the nerve
to sit

05:18.802 --> 05:19.869
next to him this time, so,

05:19.937 --> 05:21.871
you know, it was a good day
for me.

05:21.939 --> 05:23.072
We're gonna do this together.

05:23.140 --> 05:24.874
Everyone, pick up your sandwich.
Yeah?

05:24.942 --> 05:27.343
One, two, j...

05:27.411 --> 05:28.811
What's the matter with you?

05:28.879 --> 05:30.313
What's wrong with you?

05:30.381 --> 05:32.782
Me? I'm just trying
to get this

05:32.850 --> 05:34.150
- right when you bite down.
- Okay.

05:34.218 --> 05:35.752
For real, this time,
yes?

05:35.819 --> 05:39.188
One, two, three.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.957
Mm.

05:41.025 --> 05:42.058
This is good.

05:42.126 --> 05:43.126
This melts
in your mouth.

05:43.193 --> 05:44.561
Quite amazing.

05:44.628 --> 05:46.296
Something so simple
can be so popular

05:46.363 --> 05:47.397
and can translate
across the world.

05:47.464 --> 05:48.731
For your next challenge,

05:48.799 --> 05:50.333
I want to test each
and every one of you

05:50.401 --> 05:52.135
for your level
of creativity.

05:52.202 --> 05:54.270
When we get back
to Hell's Kitchen,

05:54.338 --> 05:56.439
you've each got thirty minutes

05:56.507 --> 05:59.509
to create
an amazing gourmet sandwich.

05:59.577 --> 06:00.910
These are the ingredients.

06:00.978 --> 06:02.579
Have a good look.

06:02.646 --> 06:04.247
(Ed) I thought it was
a pretty neat challenge.

06:04.315 --> 06:05.815
But, you know,
it's still hard.

06:05.883 --> 06:07.650
I still got to come up
with all these ingredients

06:07.718 --> 06:09.953
to make the sandwich taste
as good as that French Dip did.

06:10.020 --> 06:11.054
Did you enjoy the French Dip?

06:11.121 --> 06:13.423
(All)
Yes, Chef.

06:13.490 --> 06:14.857
(Gordon) Now create something
just as exciting, yes?

06:14.925 --> 06:16.359
(All) Yes, Chef.
- Okay, let's go.

06:16.427 --> 06:17.527
About this challenge,
I'm totally psyched.

06:17.595 --> 06:19.596
I love when we can cook
our own food.

06:19.663 --> 06:21.798
The sandwich is going
to be [bleep] awesome.

06:21.865 --> 06:22.966
(Siobhan) I'm kind of one of those people,
I can be sweet,

06:23.033 --> 06:24.567
I can be salty,
I can be spicy.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.903
So I think I need
to put more of my personality

06:26.971 --> 06:29.339
into my food, and my sandwich
is really gonna represent

06:29.406 --> 06:30.406
who I am.

06:32.443 --> 06:33.242
<i>(Announcer)

06:47.124 --> 06:48.391
Got it.

06:48.459 --> 06:49.792
<i>(Announcer)
He will be looking for each chef</i>

06:49.860 --> 06:51.260
<i>to come up
with a unique combination</i>

06:51.328 --> 06:54.197
<i>that will result in an
outstanding gourmet sandwich.</i>

06:54.264 --> 06:55.398
Is anybody looking
for tuna?

06:55.466 --> 06:57.100
I got my tuna already.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.202
Make sure you cut the blood line
off it, Siobhan.

06:59.269 --> 07:00.303
My tuna doesn't have

07:00.371 --> 07:01.904
much of the blood line
on it actually.

07:01.972 --> 07:04.474
(Siobhan) By far,
Benjamin has it out for me.

07:04.541 --> 07:06.442
He thinks he's this hot shot
and stuff.

07:06.510 --> 07:07.977
If I can prove to myself

07:08.045 --> 07:09.312
that I can kick some butt,

07:09.380 --> 07:10.713
Chef Ramsay sees that,

07:10.781 --> 07:12.015
that's all that matters.

07:12.082 --> 07:13.950
His opinion, to me,
I don't give a [bleep].

07:16.020 --> 07:17.020
(Ben)
Hallah?

07:17.087 --> 07:18.788
(Siobhan)
Challah bread.

07:18.856 --> 07:19.656
(Ben)
Hallah bread?

07:19.723 --> 07:21.858
Challah bread?

07:21.925 --> 07:24.127
Siobhan is driving me
[bleep] nuts.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.194
Last ten minutes,
yes?

07:25.262 --> 07:27.030
- Yes, Chef.
- Ten minutes, Siobhan.

07:27.097 --> 07:28.064
Ten minutes,
Siobhan.

07:28.132 --> 07:29.399
Thank you, Ben, yes.

07:29.466 --> 07:30.566
<i>(Announcer)
While Siobhan works hard</i>

07:30.634 --> 07:32.101
<i>to prove herself
to her teammates,</i>

07:32.169 --> 07:33.469
<i>over in the blue kitchen,</i>

07:33.537 --> 07:34.704
<i>every chef is working to make</i>

07:34.772 --> 07:35.905
<i>something truly original.</i>

07:35.973 --> 07:37.240
Foie gras mayonnaise

07:37.307 --> 07:38.307
may be one of the best things
ever.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.409
Jay, I was thinking that.

07:39.476 --> 07:40.543
I didn't go with it.

07:40.611 --> 07:41.744
I think Jay's

07:41.812 --> 07:43.279
my biggest competition
absolutely.

07:43.347 --> 07:45.748
Jay's ready to work hard,
and I'm ready to work hard.

07:45.816 --> 07:47.750
What do you think, Jay?

07:47.818 --> 07:49.185
Last minute, guys.
Let's go.

07:51.655 --> 07:52.955
(Gordon)
Okay, guys.

07:54.191 --> 07:56.592
Fifteen seconds to go, guys.
Let's go.

07:56.660 --> 07:58.227
That's the sandwich.
That's it.

07:58.295 --> 07:59.629
(Gordon)
And time, guys, yeah?

08:01.365 --> 08:03.733
Red team. One, two,
three, four, five of you.

08:03.801 --> 08:05.068
Against the blue team.

08:05.135 --> 08:06.169
Let's make it even,
shall we?

08:06.236 --> 08:08.371
Decide who
has the worst sandwich.

08:08.439 --> 08:09.539
Thirty seconds.

08:09.606 --> 08:11.140
Is anybody not happy
with theirs?

08:11.208 --> 08:12.842
- I mean, come on.
(All) I like mine.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.444
The bread is not good.
It's a soft bread.

08:14.511 --> 08:15.545
And the sear looks light.

08:15.612 --> 08:16.546
I like mine.
I don't care.

08:16.613 --> 08:17.547
I like my sandwich.

08:17.614 --> 08:18.715
I'm not backing down.

08:18.782 --> 08:19.982
If I got Siobhan's sandwich

08:20.050 --> 08:20.983
when I was eating
at a restaurant,

08:21.051 --> 08:22.151
I'd be [bleep] pissed.

08:22.219 --> 08:23.453
And I would [bleep] want
my money back.

08:23.520 --> 08:24.554
I think
it's the worst sandwich here.

08:24.621 --> 08:25.722
I think it is too.

08:25.789 --> 08:26.856
I think it is too.
I'm sorry.

08:26.924 --> 08:28.624
- Yeah.
- It doesn't look cooked enough.

08:28.692 --> 08:31.861
Every time, it's bang down,
bang down, bang down, bang down.

08:31.929 --> 08:32.828
Who's standing out?

08:32.895 --> 08:34.397
Siobhan, Chef.

08:34.465 --> 08:35.465
Siobhan.

08:37.568 --> 08:39.501
(Gordon)
Let's go. Ed and Ben.

08:39.570 --> 08:42.238
Okay, Benjamin.

08:42.306 --> 08:43.438
I have a pan-seared ahi,
Chef

08:43.506 --> 08:46.042
with a salad of watercress,
spiced olives,

08:46.110 --> 08:47.944
on a ciabatta.

08:50.214 --> 08:51.681
(Gordon)
Tuna cooked beautifully.

08:51.749 --> 08:53.216
Lemon juice at the end just
wakes up the whole sandwich.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.284
- Very nice.
- Thank you, Chef.

08:55.352 --> 08:56.319
Ed,

08:56.386 --> 08:57.320
what is it?

08:57.387 --> 08:58.488
Rolled ahi open-face sandwich.

08:58.555 --> 09:00.990
It sits
atop a grilled sesame bread.

09:01.058 --> 09:02.558
Wasabi mayonnaise underneath.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.026
A little bit of fresh mint
and chive.

09:06.396 --> 09:08.197
That's delicious.

09:08.265 --> 09:09.599
This is tough.
Very tough.

09:09.666 --> 09:14.103
Um, it goes to...

09:14.171 --> 09:15.238
Both of you.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.472
- Well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

09:16.540 --> 09:18.541
1-1.
Really good start.

09:20.410 --> 09:22.645
Holli and Jason, please,
let's go.

09:25.749 --> 09:26.649
Holli, ladies first.
What is that?

09:26.717 --> 09:27.950
Okay, it's pumpernickel bread

09:28.018 --> 09:30.553
smoked duck breast,
caramelized onions,

09:30.621 --> 09:32.321
and also a little bit
of prosciutto.

09:32.389 --> 09:34.490
It's definitely
an ambitious sandwich.

09:34.558 --> 09:35.458
It worked.

09:35.526 --> 09:36.659
Thank you, Chef.

09:36.727 --> 09:38.427
You know, I know
it was a good sandwich.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.929
I'm just glad
that he enjoyed it as well.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.397
Jason, what is that,
please?

09:41.465 --> 09:43.366
Lobster coleslaw Sloppy Joe
sandwich, Chef.

09:43.433 --> 09:45.201
How did you cook
the lobster?

09:45.269 --> 09:47.170
Steamed the lobster
in the steamer, Chef.

09:47.237 --> 09:48.738
Nice seasoning
on the slaw.

09:48.806 --> 09:50.740
Decision.
Tough one this one.

09:50.808 --> 09:52.675
Congratulations,
Holli.

09:52.743 --> 09:54.010
Thank you, Chef.

09:54.077 --> 09:55.711
And Jason.
Both you got it.

09:55.779 --> 09:56.746
(Both)
Thank you, Chef.

09:56.814 --> 09:57.847
Well done.

09:57.915 --> 09:59.048
Great start.
Really good start.

09:59.116 --> 10:01.951
2-2, guys.

10:02.019 --> 10:02.952
Fran and Jay,
let's go.

10:04.621 --> 10:05.888
Fran, off we go.
What is that?

10:05.956 --> 10:09.592
It's balsamic chicken
with roasted peppers.

10:09.660 --> 10:10.927
(Jay) I think chicken
with roasted peppers,

10:10.994 --> 10:13.362
that's, like, circa 1982.

10:13.430 --> 10:15.865
You've managed
to make that chicken delicious.

10:17.601 --> 10:19.502
- Thank you.
- Jay.

10:19.570 --> 10:21.137
Explain to me
what it is, please.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.538
I did a country pork pâté

10:22.606 --> 10:23.906
with a little bit
of foie gras fat,

10:23.974 --> 10:25.474
and then I made
a quick slaw

10:25.542 --> 10:26.776
of sort of
Vietnamese influence

10:26.844 --> 10:27.910
and a little bit
of romaine hearts.

10:29.179 --> 10:30.880
- It stands up well.
- Thank you, Chef.

10:30.948 --> 10:32.281
- It tastes delicious.
- Thank you.

10:32.349 --> 10:33.983
To identify a winner
out of those two sandwiches,

10:34.051 --> 10:37.320
there's one significant,
upsetting item

10:37.387 --> 10:38.754
that you never, ever
want to see on a sandwich.

10:38.822 --> 10:40.656
And that is soggy bread.

10:42.459 --> 10:44.894
Soaking soggy
on the inside.

10:44.962 --> 10:46.529
My biggest mistake
was not toasting

10:46.597 --> 10:48.764
the inside of the bread,
but that's just the way,

10:48.832 --> 10:50.666
I guess, Italians like it.

10:50.734 --> 10:51.767
(Gordon)
Congratulations.

10:51.835 --> 10:53.035
- Thank you.
- Well done.

10:53.103 --> 10:54.437
- Thank you.
- What a shame.

10:54.504 --> 10:57.240
3-2 to the blue.

10:57.307 --> 10:59.108
Autumn and Nilka,
let's go.

10:59.176 --> 11:00.076
Right.

11:00.143 --> 11:01.744
This is?

11:01.812 --> 11:04.213
A roasted pork with arugula,
red onions,

11:04.281 --> 11:05.781
and I did
a truffle mayonnaise.

11:05.849 --> 11:07.717
Very adventurous.

11:07.784 --> 11:09.485
It tastes delicious.

11:09.553 --> 11:10.920
Autumn.
What is that?

11:10.988 --> 11:13.256
Roasted pork loin
with sautéed vegetables

11:13.323 --> 11:17.126
that have a little balsamic
reduction added to it.

11:17.194 --> 11:18.661
Tastes good.

11:19.963 --> 11:21.497
What happened there?

11:21.565 --> 11:22.798
Why is it cut awkwardly?

11:22.866 --> 11:24.100
Did you have a problem
with the knife?

11:24.167 --> 11:27.737
No, I thought it was fine.

11:27.804 --> 11:29.739
You thought it was fine?

11:29.806 --> 11:31.474
Well, let me tell you,
presentation looks shocking.

11:31.541 --> 11:33.342
That's the kind of thing
I'd expect

11:33.410 --> 11:35.311
from a sort
of first-year culinary student,

11:35.379 --> 11:36.846
not from you.

11:36.914 --> 11:38.047
Congratulations,
Nilka.

11:38.115 --> 11:38.981
- Thank you, Chef.
- Well done.

11:39.049 --> 11:40.616
Thank you.

11:40.684 --> 11:41.918
It sucks. It sucks
that everybody gets a point

11:41.985 --> 11:43.252
on your team,
except for you.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.821
And it just makes you feel
like a loser.

11:47.224 --> 11:49.325
Unfold your arms, Autumn,
please.

11:49.393 --> 11:50.993
You may be upset
with your boring sandwich,

11:51.061 --> 11:52.395
but don't take it out
on your team.

11:54.598 --> 11:55.765
Okay, I got to break
the tie.

11:57.668 --> 11:59.735
Siobhan.

11:59.803 --> 12:01.170
- Let's go.
- Thank you, Chef.

12:01.238 --> 12:02.905
- I appreciate that.
- That just sucks.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.473
(Ben) I mean,
we're gonna have to rely

12:04.541 --> 12:05.608
on her
to get the job done.

12:05.676 --> 12:07.276
- There's no [bleep] way.
- What is it?

12:07.344 --> 12:09.378
It's a ahi tuna
on challah bread

12:09.446 --> 12:11.614
with San Andreas cheese.

12:11.682 --> 12:12.848
There's some grilled pineapple,

12:12.916 --> 12:14.750
oranges,
and prosciutto.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.074

<i>- Now with the score tied...</i>
- What is it?

12:31.012 --> 12:33.514
It's a ahi tuna sandwich.

<i>(Announcer) Chef Ramsay is tasting
Siobhan's sandwich</i>

12:35.350 --> 12:36.417
<i>before he declares a winner.</i>

12:38.920 --> 12:41.455
I actually prefer that
to Fran's.

12:41.523 --> 12:42.556
Thank you, Chef.

12:42.624 --> 12:44.158
Red team, you should have sent

12:44.226 --> 12:45.226
Siobhan's dish

12:45.293 --> 12:46.460
instead of Fran's.

12:46.528 --> 12:48.495
For that, blue team,
you win.

12:51.766 --> 12:53.701
(Siobhan)
I am so sick of it.

12:53.768 --> 12:55.369
They think
I can't [bleep] cook?

12:55.437 --> 12:57.805
My sandwich was better
than Fran's.

12:57.873 --> 12:58.906
They didn't want
to put me up there?

12:58.974 --> 13:00.274
It's their [bleep] fault.

13:00.342 --> 13:01.542
We lost a challenge
because of it.

13:03.011 --> 13:04.278
Blue team,
listen to me.

13:04.346 --> 13:05.546
Very pleased
with that performance.

13:05.614 --> 13:07.448
- Really well done.
- Thank you.

13:07.515 --> 13:09.316
Uh, red team,
dear, oh dear,

13:09.384 --> 13:10.784
for tomorrow night's service,

13:10.852 --> 13:13.220
I'm gonna put out
a really nice amuse-bouche.

13:13.288 --> 13:15.222
Peanut butter, jam,

13:15.290 --> 13:16.357
and sautéed foie gras
sandwich.

13:16.424 --> 13:17.892
(All)
Yes, Chef.

13:17.959 --> 13:19.827
Now this peanut butter
and jelly needs to be

13:19.895 --> 13:21.495
at its highest quality,
okay?

13:21.563 --> 13:22.463
So you'll be making
the peanut butter

13:22.530 --> 13:23.964
and jelly from scratch.

13:24.032 --> 13:25.232
Shelling the peanuts,

13:25.300 --> 13:26.800
grounding them by hand,

13:26.868 --> 13:28.135
and putting together
the most amazing

13:28.203 --> 13:30.037
smooth peanut butter.

13:30.105 --> 13:31.505
450,000 peanuts.

13:31.573 --> 13:33.807
That's a lot, huh?

13:33.875 --> 13:35.075
Blue team,

13:35.143 --> 13:37.511
we're all going
on a trip, yes?

13:37.579 --> 13:40.814
To California's
central wine country.

13:40.882 --> 13:42.549
Yes?

13:42.617 --> 13:43.884
We're gonna be indulging
in some phenomenal wines

13:43.952 --> 13:46.487
from the Rosemount Estates.

13:46.554 --> 13:49.056
Unfortunately,
it's a four-hour drive.

13:49.124 --> 13:50.090
But we've got a private jet.

13:50.158 --> 13:51.992
Okay?

13:52.060 --> 13:53.560
So hurry up and get ready,
yes?

13:55.530 --> 13:56.730
(Ed) A private jet.
- Dude!

13:56.798 --> 13:58.899
Losers, get cracking.

13:58.967 --> 14:01.335
I love it.

14:01.403 --> 14:02.603
One of my goals was to get
on that private jet

14:02.671 --> 14:03.671
one way or another.

14:03.738 --> 14:04.972
My other goal, obviously,

14:05.040 --> 14:06.340
is to have Chef say, "Perfect."

14:06.408 --> 14:07.574
He said it was perfect.

14:07.642 --> 14:08.976
- I can't ask anything else.
- You can't.

14:11.846 --> 14:13.047
(Siobhan) I'm tired
of being underestimated.

14:13.114 --> 14:14.114
I'm tired of it.

14:14.182 --> 14:15.282
I'm [bleep] sick of it,

14:15.350 --> 14:16.350
and I'm [bleep] pissed off.

14:16.418 --> 14:17.651
He said he liked

14:17.719 --> 14:18.819
my sandwich better than Fran's.

14:20.789 --> 14:21.956
My sandwich would have won it
for us.

14:23.558 --> 14:24.959
Siobhan lacks
a lot of confidence.

14:25.026 --> 14:26.226
But I think
she's getting pissed off.

14:26.294 --> 14:28.128
Sometimes that's
what people need.

14:28.196 --> 14:29.396
I knew it was good.

14:29.464 --> 14:30.698
I tasted it ahead of time.
It was delicious.

14:30.765 --> 14:32.366
They didn't want
to put me up there.

14:32.434 --> 14:34.234
My team
can go [bleep] themselves,

14:34.302 --> 14:37.671
'cause my sandwich was better
than Fran's.

14:37.739 --> 14:38.572
Hey, Siobhan,
if you want to win,

14:38.640 --> 14:39.840
we got to win as a team.

14:39.908 --> 14:41.208
We need to make sure
that the best food

14:41.276 --> 14:42.343
goes up there, okay?

14:42.410 --> 14:43.577
I know mine
was one of the best.

14:43.645 --> 14:45.012
Okay.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.314
Your sandwich,
not good.

14:47.382 --> 14:49.350
Your dish got voted off.

14:49.417 --> 14:50.584
I would not serve
that sandwich out of my kitchen.

14:50.652 --> 14:52.453
That's fine.
That's your personal opinion.

14:52.520 --> 14:53.620
It's not my personal opinion.

14:53.688 --> 14:54.655
This is
my professional opinion.

14:54.723 --> 14:56.490
When I tell you something,

14:56.558 --> 14:57.858
it's not because I'm trying
to undercut you.

14:57.926 --> 15:00.294
But you don't have
the experience that I have.

15:00.362 --> 15:01.795
If you don't know what you're
doing and you just start

15:01.863 --> 15:03.063
putting stuff together,
and you need to ask for help,

15:03.131 --> 15:04.431
you need to do that.

15:04.499 --> 15:06.266
I'm purely confident
in my decision.

15:06.334 --> 15:07.901
You need
to take a step down,

15:07.969 --> 15:09.103
get off your podium,

15:09.170 --> 15:11.672
and stop being
a [bleep] bossy bastard.

15:11.740 --> 15:14.441
(Ben) Cheese, oranges, pineapple,
and tuna do not go together.

15:14.509 --> 15:16.510
They went together
on mine.

15:16.578 --> 15:17.611
I'm confident
in what I did.

15:17.679 --> 15:19.480
- And that's the end of it.
- Okay.

15:19.547 --> 15:20.647
You guys obviously have it out
for me,

15:20.715 --> 15:21.749
and I don't really give
a [bleep].

15:21.816 --> 15:23.150
They all think
they're better than me?

15:23.218 --> 15:24.151
[bleep] them.

15:24.219 --> 15:25.185
Like Chef is brutally honest,

15:25.253 --> 15:26.153
I'm brutally honest too.

15:26.221 --> 15:27.621
[bleep].

15:30.658 --> 15:32.426

15:39.067 --> 15:40.067
Let's go, guys.

15:40.135 --> 15:41.668
Follow me.

15:41.736 --> 15:43.203
(Jay)
I love Chef Ramsay.

15:43.271 --> 15:44.271
I can't wait to hang out
with him.

15:44.339 --> 15:45.539
- Is it nice inside?
- Beautiful.

15:45.607 --> 15:47.107
I'm probably mostly psyched
about that.

15:48.576 --> 15:49.443
(Gordon)
Well done, well done.

15:49.511 --> 15:50.811
- Done.
- Thank you.

15:50.879 --> 15:52.012
Enjoy, yeah?

15:52.080 --> 15:53.280
Just don't get drunk
before we get

15:53.348 --> 15:54.581
to the [bleep] vineyard.

15:54.649 --> 15:55.949
Get drunk
at the vineyard.

15:56.017 --> 15:57.484
Jason, you smiled again
for the third time today.

15:57.552 --> 15:59.386
- I'm happy.
- You're happy.

15:59.454 --> 16:00.954
Yeah, I am.
I'm happy.

16:01.022 --> 16:03.824
When they say winning
is not everything,

16:03.892 --> 16:04.825
they lie.

16:04.893 --> 16:05.893
Here's to peanuts.

16:05.960 --> 16:06.827
Yeah?

16:09.164 --> 16:10.998
These are your peanuts.

16:11.066 --> 16:12.299
De-shell them all.

16:14.536 --> 16:16.904
I'm still pissed off
that my dish didn't go up.

16:20.341 --> 16:22.076
(Siobhan)
It still really pissed me off.

16:22.143 --> 16:23.811
Benjamin still wants to [bleep],
you know,

16:23.878 --> 16:26.146
bust my ass
about my sandwich and stuff,

16:26.214 --> 16:27.848
but Chef Ramsay liked it.

16:27.916 --> 16:29.116
I feel like I've barely made

16:29.184 --> 16:31.018
a dent in my bag.

16:31.086 --> 16:33.387
(Ben) She didn't shell
too many peanuts.

16:33.455 --> 16:35.022
And her sandwich still sucks.

16:35.090 --> 16:36.557
I'm getting thirsty

16:36.624 --> 16:38.592
just looking
at all the peanuts.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.394
<i>(Announcer) While the red team
shucks peanuts,</i>

16:40.462 --> 16:42.496
<i>the blue team enjoys a lesson</i>

16:42.564 --> 16:44.498
<i>in blending Rosemount wines.</i>

16:44.566 --> 16:46.166
Let's look at the first one,
that Grenache.

16:46.234 --> 16:47.134
How about a bit of a taste
of that?

16:47.202 --> 16:48.569
Try that.

16:48.636 --> 16:50.471
Wonderfully fruit-driven
Grenache.

16:50.538 --> 16:51.638
Layers of flavor.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.340
Delicious.

16:53.408 --> 16:54.441
Autumn, small sips.

16:54.509 --> 16:55.742
We don't have
to drink it all.

16:55.810 --> 16:57.611
[laughter]

16:57.679 --> 16:58.812
Oh, jeez.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.280
(Matthew)
What I need you to do then

17:00.348 --> 17:02.149
is try
the Rosemount Estate GSM.

17:02.217 --> 17:03.584
Autumn was my dog.

17:03.651 --> 17:06.353
She was giggling
about everything.

17:06.421 --> 17:08.088
Fleshy, juicy flavors.

17:08.156 --> 17:10.858
[laughter]

17:10.925 --> 17:12.893
That's all she did was smile,
giggle, giggle, smile.

17:12.961 --> 17:15.295
I've got, like,
a twenty-pound disadvantage.

17:15.363 --> 17:17.798
A twenty-pound disadvantage?
Where's that?

17:17.866 --> 17:18.866
(Jay)
I've never seen her like this

17:18.933 --> 17:20.200
since we've lived together.

17:20.268 --> 17:21.401
"I'm fine.
I swear to God."

17:21.469 --> 17:22.603
[laughs]

17:22.670 --> 17:23.837
(Jay)
By far

17:23.905 --> 17:25.973
the most amazing
challenge award ever

17:26.040 --> 17:27.340
in the history
of Hell's Kitchen.

17:27.407 --> 17:29.343
I believe Autumn had the most
to drink.

17:29.410 --> 17:31.812
She definitely was a little
on the crippled side.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.113
(Gordon)
You're such a lightweight.

17:33.181 --> 17:34.314
Aren't you?

17:34.382 --> 17:36.049
This is all true.

17:36.117 --> 17:38.051
I'm drunk, I'm drunk.
That's the way it is.

17:38.119 --> 17:39.119
I don't weigh that much.

17:39.187 --> 17:40.254
It's not my fault.

17:40.321 --> 17:41.889
Matt, thank you.
Well done, guys.

17:41.956 --> 17:43.023
Well done,
well done.

17:43.091 --> 17:45.025
- Thank you for having us.
- Absolutely.

17:45.093 --> 17:46.793
You don't want to lose
a challenge.

17:49.097 --> 17:51.165
(Siobhan) This is the
worst punishment by far.

17:51.232 --> 17:52.799
(Fran)
It's like trying to put

17:52.867 --> 17:54.568
a bunch of rocks
through that grinder.

17:54.636 --> 17:56.837
I don't want to see a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich

17:56.905 --> 17:58.038
for the rest of my life.

17:58.106 --> 18:00.407
I don't know
how much more I can take.

18:00.475 --> 18:02.309
<i>(Announcer) The red team

18:02.377 --> 18:03.911
<i>of their situation.</i>

18:08.816 --> 18:10.083
He must be because I have never
seen him like that.

18:13.788 --> 18:17.391
If I go there drunk.

18:17.458 --> 18:18.959
(Ed) Hey, guys.
Everybody good?

18:19.027 --> 18:20.260
(Ben) We're doing good.
How you doing?

18:20.328 --> 18:21.828
(Jason)
You really don't want to know.

18:21.896 --> 18:23.964
Holding my wine.
Excuse me.

18:24.032 --> 18:24.998
I just have to know.
Are you happy?

18:25.066 --> 18:26.700
I can't talk.

18:26.768 --> 18:28.435
[laughter]

18:28.503 --> 18:29.503
(Fran)
The blue team came back,

18:29.571 --> 18:32.206
and they were so drunk.

18:32.273 --> 18:33.574
They couldn't even speak

18:33.641 --> 18:34.608
- they were so drunk.
- Whoo.

18:34.676 --> 18:35.776
You're so pissed right now,

18:35.843 --> 18:36.843
it's funny.

18:36.911 --> 18:38.512
(Fran)
So I'm hoping that

18:38.580 --> 18:39.780
that high they have

18:39.847 --> 18:41.415
is gonna affect their ability
tomorrow,

18:41.482 --> 18:43.217
and the red team
will persevere

18:43.284 --> 18:44.785
and beat them.

18:44.852 --> 18:47.054
This is, like,
the worst punishment ever.

18:50.625 --> 18:51.792
We had a great time.

18:51.859 --> 18:55.229
It was a great bonding
experience.

18:55.296 --> 18:57.864
I feel really great going
into the next dinner challenge,

18:57.932 --> 18:59.733
and...

19:01.903 --> 19:03.804
No more drinks
for Autumn.

19:05.573 --> 19:06.974
[Laughter]

19:07.041 --> 19:09.409
I may have encouraged Ed
to drink a little bit more.

19:11.679 --> 19:13.213
Ed is completely trashed.

19:13.281 --> 19:16.250
So it was kind of funny.

19:20.154 --> 19:21.622
A little encouragement...

19:23.091 --> 19:25.058
to add to his bad feelings

19:25.126 --> 19:27.427
in the morning never hurts.

19:33.835 --> 19:34.735
I come out
to the hot tub,

19:34.802 --> 19:37.170
and there's Ed and Holli.

19:37.238 --> 19:38.839
And I'm like, oh, God,
like, are they making out?

19:38.906 --> 19:42.709
And they're, like, fooling
around and being silly.

19:44.512 --> 19:45.445
Get crazy.

(Siobhan) Oh, my God,
the quiet, reserved Ed

19:50.351 --> 19:52.653

a wild animal.

Eddie?

on command right now.

Yeah, I could.

22:01.273 --> 22:03.407
I was just
a little bit groggy.

22:03.475 --> 22:05.309
I was a little hung over
when I first woke up.

22:08.246 --> 22:09.713
Then there was four.

22:09.781 --> 22:11.282
- Good morning, Chef.
- How's everybody?

22:11.349 --> 22:12.883
Uh.

22:12.951 --> 22:14.752
That was ridiculous.

22:14.819 --> 22:16.654

of work to do.

in our favor.

how those boys are feeling.

Anybody get potatoes on yet?

22:29.634 --> 22:30.534

to the restroom real quick

22:34.105 --> 22:35.139
- before we get started.
(Jason) Go right ahead.

22:35.207 --> 22:36.273
Throw up number one.

22:37.676 --> 22:39.076
[mock-vomits]

22:39.144 --> 22:41.679
I think the prep today
is lagging

22:41.746 --> 22:43.080
because some
of the team members

22:43.148 --> 22:44.381
overindulged yesterday.

22:44.449 --> 22:45.950
Do you have the potatoes
for those already?

22:46.017 --> 22:48.352
I did them
for the crab.

22:48.420 --> 22:49.920
You're supposed to save half
of 'em.

22:49.988 --> 22:51.088
[bleep].

22:52.691 --> 22:55.025
So you seared
the halibut immediately?

22:55.093 --> 22:56.060
Halibut's not on the menu
tonight.

22:56.127 --> 22:57.494
[bleep].

22:57.562 --> 22:58.896
They've all been messing up
over there.

22:58.964 --> 23:00.464
I'm standing over there

23:00.532 --> 23:01.865
making the pommes Anna,
and all I hear's is...

23:04.302 --> 23:06.036
(Ben)
You know, I do think

23:06.104 --> 23:07.471
we do have a little edge
on the blue team.

23:07.539 --> 23:09.206
I would like to send a message
to them

23:09.274 --> 23:10.174
they're not
[bleep] untouchable.

23:10.242 --> 23:11.542
Chicken breast has been done.

23:11.610 --> 23:12.943
We got the Pommes Anna.

23:13.011 --> 23:14.678
- Is the cream whipped?
- Yeah, cream's whipped.

23:14.746 --> 23:16.180
If we all cook the best
we can,

23:16.248 --> 23:18.082
we can win tonight.

23:22.292 --> 23:23.960
- Right, Jean-Philippe.
- Chef.

23:24.027 --> 23:25.061
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.
Let's go.

<i>(Announcer)

23:38.208 --> 23:40.676
I'm gonna do
the creamy lobster risotto.

23:40.744 --> 23:41.911
<i>(Announcer)

23:46.683 --> 23:48.017
Let's go.

23:48.085 --> 23:49.085
Two scallops,
two risotto entree.

23:49.153 --> 23:50.186
Two salmon,
two beef.

23:50.254 --> 23:51.254
Both beef medium.
Get them in.

23:51.321 --> 23:52.388
Yes, Chef.

23:52.456 --> 23:53.456
I've never made
a risotto here yet,

23:53.524 --> 23:55.291
so I just want to get that down.

23:55.359 --> 23:56.626
The rest of the station
I'm fine with.

23:56.693 --> 23:58.060
Fran, do you have the chives
and the lemon in there?

23:58.128 --> 23:59.829
- I do.
- I am worried about Fran.

23:59.897 --> 24:00.963
If we have a slow start,

24:01.031 --> 24:02.799
that's gonna screw us up.

24:02.866 --> 24:04.767
- Where's the risotto?
- It's coming right now, Chef.

24:04.835 --> 24:06.102
- One sec.
- Move, Fran.

24:06.170 --> 24:07.937
- Risotto's right here.
- Let's go.

24:08.005 --> 24:09.138
Hot pan.
Get out of my way.

24:09.206 --> 24:10.306
It's a pain
in the ass

24:10.374 --> 24:11.574
to make a good risotto.

24:11.642 --> 24:12.575
Tough is not the word.

24:12.643 --> 24:14.877
Madam!

24:14.945 --> 24:16.946
(Fran)
Yes, Chef?

24:17.014 --> 24:18.181
Very nice that risotto.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.916
Thank you very much,
Chef.

24:19.983 --> 24:21.918
- That was good timing, Fran.
- Just stay confident.

<i>Chef Ramsay's looking

24:29.026 --> 24:30.593
Two scallops, one capellini,
one risotto, then, yes.

24:30.661 --> 24:32.128
- Yes, Chef.
- Jay, how long?

24:32.196 --> 24:34.063
- Four minutes.
- 'Cause...

24:34.131 --> 24:36.499
Oh, no.
The scallops, they ready.

24:36.567 --> 24:37.633
Pick it up.
Let's go.

24:37.701 --> 24:38.935
Four, three, two, one
together, yes?

24:39.002 --> 24:40.203
(All) Yes, Chef.
- Come on, guys.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.838
Three minutes.
Jason.

24:41.905 --> 24:43.940
I'm hoping that we can
sort of gel as a team,

24:44.007 --> 24:45.141
and we just need
to communicate well,

24:45.209 --> 24:46.409
and hopefully
I don't screw it up.

24:46.476 --> 24:48.811
Scallops coming
out of the pan.

24:48.879 --> 24:50.780
I need a minute
and a half still.

24:50.848 --> 24:52.048
[bleep].

24:52.115 --> 24:53.716
Everybody needs
to be on the same page.

24:53.784 --> 24:54.784
It has to be perfect.

25:00.490 --> 25:01.657
(Gordon)
Uh, Jason.

25:01.725 --> 25:03.025
Yes, Chef.
Overcooked scallops.

25:03.093 --> 25:04.260
Rubbery as [bleep].
Like a [bleep] ping pong ball.

25:04.328 --> 25:05.795
- Jay.
- Yes, Chef.

25:05.863 --> 25:07.463
- More salt.
- More salt, Chef.

25:07.531 --> 25:08.531
And it's [bleep] raw,
Jay.

25:09.900 --> 25:10.766
- Yes, Chef.
- [bleep] now, guys.

25:10.834 --> 25:11.901
It's elementary, this stuff.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.302
This first table's important.

25:13.370 --> 25:14.503
Yes, Chef.

25:14.571 --> 25:15.805
It sets up the tone
for the evening, yes?

25:15.873 --> 25:17.240
- Exactly. Yes, Chef.
- Come on, guys.

25:17.307 --> 25:18.774
- I got it. I got it.
- [bleep] now.

25:18.842 --> 25:20.209
(Jason) We did get off
to a rough start.

25:20.277 --> 25:21.210
The scallops were rubbery.

25:21.278 --> 25:22.378
Point taken.

25:22.446 --> 25:23.813
I start off
with a starter like that,

25:23.881 --> 25:25.314
it make me
[bleep] really nervous.

25:25.382 --> 25:26.716
- Yes, Chef.
- Poor service.

25:26.783 --> 25:28.150
I thought we got rid
of the weakest link in here.

25:28.218 --> 25:29.385
Already, you're acting
like a bunch of idiots.

25:29.403 --> 25:30.401
We may have had some fun
in the [bleep] vineyard,

25:30.420 --> 25:31.487
but that's [bleep] gone.

25:31.555 --> 25:32.521
What I need now
is serious cooking.

25:32.589 --> 25:34.023
Yes, Chef.

- More [bleep] seasoning.

Talk to me.
Look at me.

29:36.993 --> 29:38.160
Excuse me.
Hey, hey.

29:38.228 --> 29:39.628
Don't come in here
acting, like, jumped up

29:39.696 --> 29:40.729
like some little gym bunny.

29:40.797 --> 29:42.431
Now do me a favor.
That's his job.

29:42.499 --> 29:43.466
You [bleep] off, yes?

29:45.102 --> 29:46.769
Poison you?
What a [bleep].

29:46.837 --> 29:48.304
It's beef,
you [bleep] idiot, tartare.

29:48.371 --> 29:50.806
You've never heard
of that, have you?

29:50.874 --> 29:51.907
Go get a shave,
you [bleep] [bleep].

29:51.975 --> 29:53.843
Let's go.

29:53.910 --> 29:55.611
Standing there
like some [bleep] jerk.

29:55.679 --> 29:56.679
Stand strong, buddy.

29:56.746 --> 29:58.280
Stand nice and strong.

29:58.348 --> 30:00.382
Push your arms out.
You look like a [bleep] quail.

30:01.918 --> 30:03.586
<i>(Announcer)
Now that Chef Ramsay</i>

30:03.653 --> 30:05.454
<i>has dealt
with the foul customer,</i>

30:05.522 --> 30:07.022
<i>he can refocus
his attention on...</i>

30:07.090 --> 30:09.158
- Nilka!
- Yes, Chef.

30:09.226 --> 30:11.127
- Two beef, two chicken, let's go.
- Yes, Chef.

30:11.194 --> 30:12.728
(Holli)
All right, I'm ready

30:12.796 --> 30:13.896
- with the sides.
- All right, bring it up.

30:13.964 --> 30:15.464
I'm coming right behind you.

30:15.532 --> 30:16.398
(Holli)
Coming right now?

30:16.466 --> 30:18.267
(Nilka)
Yeah.

30:18.335 --> 30:19.935
Garnish the two chicken.

30:20.003 --> 30:22.638
Right here, Chef.

30:22.706 --> 30:23.772
It feels [bleep] cold.

30:25.075 --> 30:27.243
No, we got
a pink chicken.

30:27.310 --> 30:28.611
All of you,
come here.

30:30.914 --> 30:32.114
Pink chicken.

30:32.182 --> 30:34.617
Not just pink,
but [bleep] raw.

30:34.684 --> 30:36.919
And you will look
like it cooked raw.

30:36.987 --> 30:37.887
Raw, raw!

30:40.457 --> 30:41.390
It's sliced.

30:41.458 --> 30:42.358
You can obviously see

30:42.425 --> 30:43.392
that it's [bleep] raw.

30:43.460 --> 30:44.426
You can't send up raw chicken,

30:44.494 --> 30:45.828
no matter what.

30:45.896 --> 30:47.263
I would respect you
ten times more

30:47.330 --> 30:48.764
when you tell me
the chicken's raw.

30:48.832 --> 30:50.666
(Nilka)
Oh, why?

30:50.734 --> 30:52.134
I tried so hard.

30:52.202 --> 30:53.702
I did not want
to [bleep] up tonight.

30:53.770 --> 30:55.204
It's not fair.
You can't just do that.

30:55.272 --> 30:56.438
"My chicken's raw."

30:56.506 --> 30:57.873
You're right.

30:57.941 --> 30:59.675
<i>(Announcer)
As Nilka starts over</i>

30:59.743 --> 31:01.143
<i>on her chicken,
Chef Ramsay has a question</i>

31:01.211 --> 31:02.578
<i>for the blue team.</i>

31:02.646 --> 31:03.779
Beef, where is it?

31:03.847 --> 31:04.947
Well done, beef,
right here, Chef.

31:05.015 --> 31:06.182
Salmon, sauces.
Let's go.

31:06.249 --> 31:07.149
Come on, Autumn.

31:08.618 --> 31:09.685
Ed, you got to pick it up.

31:09.753 --> 31:10.619
Two salmons waiting,
one beef.

31:10.687 --> 31:11.587
How long?

31:11.655 --> 31:12.555
I'm ready for it right now.

31:12.622 --> 31:14.023
Then why aren't we going then?

31:14.090 --> 31:15.224
You've sliced the waiting time.

31:15.292 --> 31:16.625
Let's go.
Thirty seconds.

31:16.693 --> 31:18.093
Autumn, did you hear that?

31:18.161 --> 31:19.762
Autumn.

31:19.829 --> 31:21.397
There's got to be
some teamwork here, guys.

31:21.464 --> 31:22.431
(Ed)
We had no communication.

31:22.499 --> 31:23.532
It was actually terrible.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.201
I was trying to talk
to Autumn,

31:25.268 --> 31:27.002
and she wasn't giving me
any answers.

31:27.070 --> 31:28.370
- Come on, guys, come on.
(Autumn) Yes, Chef.

31:28.438 --> 31:30.272
At least bring
the [bleep] salmon, big boy.

31:30.340 --> 31:31.807
- Where is it?
- Yes, Chef. Right here, Chef.

31:31.875 --> 31:33.776
Don't start [bleep] killing me
now, guys.

31:33.843 --> 31:35.177
Hot coming now.

31:35.245 --> 31:36.011
- Hot pan.
- Where's the duck?

31:37.847 --> 31:38.747
Where's the duck?

31:38.815 --> 31:40.082
Ten seconds, Chef.

31:40.150 --> 31:41.450
Slicing right now.

31:41.518 --> 31:42.851
(Gordon)
Don't do this to me, guys.

31:42.919 --> 31:44.153
I'm getting a bit of this,

31:44.221 --> 31:45.654
a bit of that,
a bit of this,

31:45.722 --> 31:47.389
and a bit of that.
Come together!

31:47.457 --> 31:50.125
Sorry, Chef.
Duck.

31:51.828 --> 31:53.896
Oh, what a [bleep].

31:53.964 --> 31:55.631
Just all of you come here
a minute.

31:55.699 --> 31:57.433
No, Jay,
it's not good enough.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.468
It's not... that's how
it comes in sliced.

31:59.536 --> 32:01.604
But, yeah,
it's [bleep] raw.

32:01.671 --> 32:02.938
It's not good enough, guys!

32:03.006 --> 32:04.373
(Ed)
Let's go, guys.

32:04.441 --> 32:06.442
Hey, Ed, come here.
Hold your hands out.

32:06.509 --> 32:07.977
Yeah, look at me.

32:08.044 --> 32:09.211
You, you,
you,

32:09.279 --> 32:11.313
and you, get the [bleep] out.

32:11.381 --> 32:13.782
Leave me alone.
Get out.

32:13.850 --> 32:14.817
Get out!

32:14.884 --> 32:15.851
Get out!

32:21.079 --> 32:22.246
<i>(Announcer)

<i>into a disappointing

32:23.815 --> 32:26.217

32:26.285 --> 32:27.918
<i>(Announcer) Ed's raw duck

32:27.986 --> 32:29.620

32:29.688 --> 32:31.022
- Hey, Ed, come here.
- Yes, Chef.

32:31.089 --> 32:32.623
Come here.
Hold your hands out.

32:32.691 --> 32:34.125
Look at me.
You, you,

32:34.192 --> 32:36.394
you, and you,
get the [bleep] out.

32:36.461 --> 32:38.663
Leave me alone.

32:38.730 --> 32:41.098
Get out!

32:41.166 --> 32:41.866
[bleep] off.

32:44.503 --> 32:45.536
My bad, guys.

32:45.604 --> 32:47.171
No, we was doing fine.

32:47.239 --> 32:48.139
- Yeah.
- My bad.

32:48.206 --> 32:49.373
That's some [bleep].

32:49.441 --> 32:50.241
I don't think
we were doing awesome.

32:50.309 --> 32:51.342
I wouldn't go that far.

32:51.410 --> 32:52.376
You don't think we was doing
too good?

32:52.444 --> 32:53.511
- No.
- Why not?

32:53.578 --> 32:54.945
Our timing was off.

32:55.013 --> 32:56.647
Every single ticket,
there was things not together.

32:56.715 --> 32:58.416
His biggest thing
is communication and timing.

32:58.483 --> 33:00.818
My teammates always,
you know, "It was good enough."

33:00.886 --> 33:02.186
Like, good enough
is not good enough

33:02.254 --> 33:03.321
for Chef Ramsay,
and I think the sooner

33:03.388 --> 33:04.922
people understand that,

33:04.990 --> 33:06.090
the better off
we'll all be.

33:06.158 --> 33:08.059
Coming up thirty seconds after,

33:08.126 --> 33:09.527
technically,
is not right.

33:09.594 --> 33:11.095
That's the thing.

33:11.163 --> 33:12.263
(Woman)
What happened?

33:12.331 --> 33:13.064
The blue team
kind of disappeared.

33:13.131 --> 33:14.398
What happened?

33:14.466 --> 33:15.533
You noticed as well.

33:15.600 --> 33:16.400
(Women)
Yeah.

33:16.468 --> 33:18.903
Hey, madam,

33:18.970 --> 33:20.738
I can't even get
a [bleep] salad dressed.

33:20.806 --> 33:22.506
Look, it's not even dressed.
Look, like rabbit food.

33:22.574 --> 33:24.809
I think Fran talks like she
knows how to [bleep] cook,

33:24.876 --> 33:26.043
but she can't do [bleep].

33:26.111 --> 33:27.278
Not one piece,

33:27.346 --> 33:28.679
not two piece,
look.

33:28.747 --> 33:30.448
Nothing.
Not even dressed.

33:30.515 --> 33:32.450
- I'll redo it, Chef.
- That's a salad.

33:32.517 --> 33:35.419
You know,
there's only so much

33:35.487 --> 33:36.921
one person can do
at that starter.

33:36.988 --> 33:37.855
(Gordon) Two risotto.
How long?

33:37.923 --> 33:39.090
It's coming right now.

33:39.157 --> 33:40.558
Come on, Fran.
You can do it. Come on.

33:42.027 --> 33:43.194
It's raw.

33:43.261 --> 33:45.196
Every [bleep] bit.

33:45.263 --> 33:47.498
Your risotto...
madam, madam.

33:47.566 --> 33:49.367
Touch the risotto.
Taste the rice.

33:49.434 --> 33:51.535
Up and down,
up and down,

33:51.603 --> 33:53.237
up and [bleep] down.

33:53.305 --> 33:54.939
Do me a favor.
Look at me.

33:55.006 --> 33:56.707
You, you,

33:56.775 --> 33:59.276
you, and him,
get out.

33:59.344 --> 34:00.644
Get out.
Get out of my sight.

34:00.712 --> 34:02.213
Get out.
Just get out.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.615
Useless bits of crap.

34:04.683 --> 34:06.584
The man is nuts.
Not us.

34:06.651 --> 34:08.452
This is ridiculous.
Every day.

34:08.520 --> 34:10.286
It was a cluster [bleep]
is what it was.

34:10.355 --> 34:12.156
(Fran)
I don't understand.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.623
Why'd you guys
get kicked out?

34:13.692 --> 34:15.025
[bleep].
We both got kicked out?

34:15.092 --> 34:16.193
Yeah, they got kicked out
before us.

34:16.261 --> 34:18.161
(Ben)
It's ridiculous.

34:18.230 --> 34:19.397
We [bleep] get thrown out
of the kitchen

34:19.464 --> 34:20.531
because they're a
[bleep] bunch of yahoos,

34:20.599 --> 34:21.465
and it's so
[bleep] frustrating.

34:23.168 --> 34:24.268
(Fran)
How is this possible?

34:24.335 --> 34:25.503
We were
all communicating.

34:25.570 --> 34:26.670
We weren't doing well,
guys.

34:26.737 --> 34:27.737
We weren't doing well.

34:28.974 --> 34:30.674
We're gonna get
[bleep] reamed

34:30.742 --> 34:32.943
when we go back in there.

34:36.882 --> 34:38.081
Where do I start?

34:38.150 --> 34:39.150
Someone tell me

34:39.217 --> 34:40.885
what the [bleep] was going on

34:40.952 --> 34:42.520
- in there tonight.
- I [bleep] up.

34:42.587 --> 34:44.221
I tried to do too many things
at once.

34:44.289 --> 34:45.723
Period. I take
full responsibility

34:45.791 --> 34:46.657
for my mistakes tonight.

34:46.725 --> 34:47.658
And that's it?

34:47.726 --> 34:48.926
I went wrong definitely.

34:48.994 --> 34:50.628
I undercooked the chicken.

34:50.695 --> 34:51.661
I [bleep] that one up,
and right now,

34:51.730 --> 34:52.929
there shouldn't be no errors.

34:52.998 --> 34:53.898
Right now, we should be cooking
at our best.

34:53.965 --> 34:56.266
It was pink
and cold.

34:56.333 --> 34:57.368
Anyone else?

34:57.436 --> 34:58.469
I [bleep] up too,
Chef.

34:58.537 --> 34:59.570
Hmm. Oh, really?

35:00.772 --> 35:01.872
Blue team?

35:03.475 --> 35:04.575
What the [bleep]
were you doing, Ed?

35:04.643 --> 35:05.676
- Wasn't listening.
- Were you drunk?

35:05.744 --> 35:06.510
Were you drinking
a little bit

35:06.578 --> 35:07.645
too much of the white wine

35:07.712 --> 35:08.479
as opposed to put it
in the risotto?

35:08.547 --> 35:10.748
No, Chef.

35:10.816 --> 35:12.049
I have had enough.

35:12.117 --> 35:13.517
Winning team?

35:13.585 --> 35:14.552
Winning what?

35:17.155 --> 35:18.889
All of you are going
upstairs to the [bleep] dorm.

35:18.957 --> 35:20.391
And the blue team
and the red team

35:20.459 --> 35:22.827
come up with two individuals
in each team

35:22.894 --> 35:25.396
and think who is going
to be leaving Hell's Kitchen.

35:25.464 --> 35:26.697
Now [bleep] off
out of here.

35:30.302 --> 35:32.403
(Jay) The blue team losing
doesn't happen a lot.

35:32.471 --> 35:34.939
So when we lose,
we take it twice as hard.

35:35.006 --> 35:36.707
It definitely screws
with our morale.

35:36.775 --> 35:38.642
Unfortunately, we're gonna have
to make a hard decision.

35:42.547 --> 35:43.547
Autumn,

35:43.615 --> 35:45.049
I think my first choice
is you.

35:45.116 --> 35:48.719
Ed, my second choice
is you.

35:48.787 --> 35:49.954
I think you made
a lot of little mistakes.

35:50.021 --> 35:51.288
And I think you made
one major mistake.

35:51.356 --> 35:53.190
What he said.

35:53.258 --> 35:55.426
(Autumn) There's no way
that I deserve to be nominated.

35:55.494 --> 35:56.994
I made a bunch
of little mistakes.

35:57.062 --> 35:58.395
It sucks.
It sucks.

35:58.463 --> 35:59.663
It's awful.

36:01.766 --> 36:03.100
(Ed)
Get it organized.

36:03.168 --> 36:06.237
I've only had one bad service,

36:06.304 --> 36:07.538
but one bad service
can mean everything now,

36:07.606 --> 36:08.906
so, you know,
you can't go by that.

36:08.974 --> 36:11.041
I'm just gonna fight.

36:11.109 --> 36:12.510
It still sucks...

36:12.577 --> 36:14.945
(Jay)
No, it sucks. No, I know.

36:20.051 --> 36:22.553
I... I pick Siobhan.

36:22.621 --> 36:25.222
I almost [bleep] threw you
out of the kitchen myself.

36:25.290 --> 36:26.857
I really did.

36:26.925 --> 36:28.893
(Siobhan) The difference
between Benjamin and myself

36:28.960 --> 36:31.595
is Benjamin has been
classically French trained.

36:31.663 --> 36:33.330
He loves French everything.

36:33.398 --> 36:34.899
[bleep] the French.

36:34.966 --> 36:36.600
I'm gonna have
to pick Siobhan and Fran.

36:36.668 --> 36:37.735
Here I go again.

36:37.802 --> 36:39.036
And why is it me?

36:39.104 --> 36:41.238
Because it just seems
like you was going so slow.

36:41.306 --> 36:42.406
You know what?

36:42.474 --> 36:44.041
Listen.
Just listen.

36:44.109 --> 36:45.509
I had to refire
those risottos

36:45.577 --> 36:46.744
because it was too late.

36:46.811 --> 36:48.012
If I brought them up there,

36:48.079 --> 36:49.280
then he was going to bring them
back to me.

36:49.347 --> 36:50.581
(Fran)
Nilka, she still [bleep] up.

36:50.649 --> 36:52.283
She deserves to go home
and not me,

36:52.350 --> 36:53.450
and I'm gonna make sure
I fight

36:53.518 --> 36:54.852
every [bleep] minute
to stay here,

36:54.920 --> 36:56.120
because I deserve
to be here.

36:56.187 --> 36:59.156
I'm gonna have to go
with Siobhan and Nilka.

36:59.224 --> 37:00.257
It was one chicken,
but okay.

37:00.325 --> 37:02.560
- But you know, I don't...
- Yeah, I know.

37:02.627 --> 37:03.594
(Nilka)
I'm not gonna put myself up

37:03.662 --> 37:04.662
for one piece of chicken.

37:04.729 --> 37:06.063
I don't think that's grounds

37:06.131 --> 37:08.699
for elimination.
No, no, no, no.

37:12.604 --> 37:14.438
And we have to choose two.

37:28.987 --> 37:30.220
Okay.

37:30.288 --> 37:31.722
Jay?

37:31.790 --> 37:32.823
Blue team, first nominee,
and why, please.

37:32.891 --> 37:35.492
Autumn, Chef.

37:35.560 --> 37:36.994
We believe that it was hard
to keep a good pace

37:37.062 --> 37:38.963
when the garnishes were late
to the pass.

37:39.030 --> 37:41.332
It slowed us down.

37:41.399 --> 37:42.666
Second nominee and why, please.

37:42.734 --> 37:44.702
Second nominee, Chef,
was Ed.

37:44.769 --> 37:45.903
We decided that serving
a raw duck to you

37:45.971 --> 37:48.005
was unacceptable.

37:48.073 --> 37:49.807
Benjamin,
red team.

37:49.874 --> 37:52.443
- First nominee, and why.
- Siobhan, Chef.

37:52.510 --> 37:53.477
(Gordon)
Siobhan.

37:53.545 --> 37:54.979
(Ben)
We chose Siobhan

37:55.046 --> 37:56.146
because she couldn't handle
any of the dishes.

37:56.214 --> 37:57.748
And she brought us down
in appetizers

37:57.816 --> 37:58.649
as well as entrees.

38:00.018 --> 38:01.819
Second nominee, and why.

38:17.235 --> 38:19.637
<i>(Announcer) After a disastrous
dinner service,</i>

38:19.705 --> 38:20.971
<i>Chef Ramsay has asked
both teams</i>

38:21.039 --> 38:22.606
<i>to nominate two
of their own</i>

38:22.674 --> 38:23.741
<i>for elimination.</i>

38:23.809 --> 38:26.377
<i>The blue team has put up
Autumn and Ed.</i>

38:26.445 --> 38:29.113
<i>The red team's first nominee
is Siobhan.</i>

38:29.181 --> 38:30.514
(Ben)
Second nomination, Chef,

38:30.582 --> 38:32.116
is Fran.

38:33.618 --> 38:34.719
Again?

38:34.786 --> 38:36.020
Again, Chef.

38:36.088 --> 38:37.722
She's disorganized.

38:37.789 --> 38:38.989
It's difficult
to work with her

38:39.057 --> 38:41.025
'cause she doesn't communicate
as clearly,

38:41.093 --> 38:42.960
and every time she talks back
to you, Chef,

38:43.028 --> 38:44.795
it's disrespectful,
and it hurts this kitchen.

38:44.863 --> 38:46.097
Let's go.

38:46.164 --> 38:47.398
Autumn, Ed, Siobhan,

38:47.466 --> 38:49.166
Fran,

38:49.234 --> 38:50.234
get your ass up here.
Let's go.

38:55.307 --> 38:58.142
Ed, you've been in the kitchen
for ten years.

38:58.210 --> 38:59.543
Yes, Chef.

38:59.611 --> 39:00.811
Why can't you cook
a duck breast?

39:00.879 --> 39:02.012
I should have waited.

39:02.080 --> 39:03.013
Take an extra minute.

39:03.081 --> 39:04.415
I should have told you that.

39:04.483 --> 39:05.883
You know, and let it rest
completely,

39:05.951 --> 39:06.751
instead of slicing it
right away.

39:06.818 --> 39:07.952
And I was rushing.

39:08.019 --> 39:09.186
The only thing
that was missing

39:09.254 --> 39:10.054
was the [bleep] feathers
and the beak.

39:10.122 --> 39:12.723
It was that [bleep] raw.

39:12.791 --> 39:15.292
Autumn, here's the conclusion
with you.

39:15.360 --> 39:17.395
Couldn't settle with the ladies
in the red team.

39:17.462 --> 39:18.929
The guys like you.

39:18.997 --> 39:21.365
But within the first hour
of service tonight,

39:21.433 --> 39:23.667
you were highlighted
as the weakest.

39:25.036 --> 39:26.570
I can come back
from this.

39:26.638 --> 39:28.539
I can show you
that I can move fast

39:28.607 --> 39:29.707
and hit the ground running.

39:29.775 --> 39:31.542
I can do better.
I know I can do better.

39:31.610 --> 39:32.910
And I will.

39:32.978 --> 39:34.111
Truthfully,
I haven't got time

39:34.179 --> 39:35.179
to wait any longer.

39:35.247 --> 39:37.915
Fran,

39:37.983 --> 39:39.417
why the [bleep] should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

39:39.484 --> 39:41.986
I have been here a ridiculous
amount of times, granted.

39:42.053 --> 39:43.788
Everything you say to me,

39:43.855 --> 39:45.489
regardless if you're yelling,

39:45.557 --> 39:46.757
I know it's for a reason.

39:46.825 --> 39:49.927
You've spent more time
on that spot

39:49.995 --> 39:51.061
than you have
on your section.

39:51.129 --> 39:53.831
Siobhan,

39:53.899 --> 39:56.133
somebody in the red team tonight
threw you

39:56.201 --> 39:58.702
off your section,
and you allowed it.

39:58.770 --> 39:59.904
Can I help you?

39:59.971 --> 40:02.072
- Stay on desserts.
- Stay on desserts.

40:02.140 --> 40:05.242
Why do you think
you should stay here

40:05.310 --> 40:08.012
when you can't even say no?

40:08.079 --> 40:09.413
Chef, when that happened
in the kitchen,

40:09.481 --> 40:12.383
i felt that it was for the best
of the team,

40:12.451 --> 40:13.717
and I wasn't,
in a professional standpoint

40:13.785 --> 40:15.019
in an open kitchen

40:15.086 --> 40:16.787
going to bicker
with another teammate.

40:16.855 --> 40:18.389
And there was no excuse
for what I did tonight.

40:18.457 --> 40:20.724
Done.
I can't do anymore.

40:20.792 --> 40:23.627
Siobhan, give me your jacket.

40:28.834 --> 40:30.034
I cannot do it
anymore.

40:30.101 --> 40:32.403
You work hard,
you bust your ass,

40:32.471 --> 40:34.338
you mean well,

40:34.406 --> 40:36.207
you just have not got enough
experience to stay any longer.

40:36.274 --> 40:37.641
Do you know why?

40:37.709 --> 40:38.809
Because it's going to get harder
from now in.

40:38.877 --> 40:40.077
And I can't carry you
any longer.

40:40.145 --> 40:41.679
Thank you
for the opportunity.

40:41.746 --> 40:43.614
- Thank you so much.
- Good night.

40:46.184 --> 40:47.685
I'm definitely leaving
Hell's Kitchen

40:47.752 --> 40:49.386
with a lot of confidence,
and I'm very proud

40:49.454 --> 40:51.655
to at least have gotten
this far.

40:51.723 --> 40:53.924
It would be nice
to run the Savoy Grill,

40:53.992 --> 40:56.360
but to take this experience
and to learn so much from it

40:56.428 --> 40:57.628
is priceless.

40:57.696 --> 40:59.196
All-in-all,
I stayed professional.

40:59.264 --> 41:00.764
I stayed true to myself.

41:00.832 --> 41:03.367
And I was brave and fearless
the entire way through.

41:06.605 --> 41:08.105
(Gordon)
There's 50% of you left.

41:08.173 --> 41:10.174
So that means something
quite significant for me.

41:10.242 --> 41:11.375
I've got the best half.

41:13.411 --> 41:15.913
If I've got the best half
left in Hell's Kitchen,

41:15.981 --> 41:17.147
[bleep] prove your worth.

41:19.518 --> 41:20.618
Good night.

41:23.522 --> 41:25.289
(Fran)
I feel like it's every day

41:25.357 --> 41:26.957
I'm fighting
for my life here.

41:27.025 --> 41:29.460
But I know I've really got
to push even harder than ever

41:29.528 --> 41:31.462
to stay in Hell's Kitchen.

41:31.530 --> 41:33.097
(Autumn)
I want to prove

41:33.164 --> 41:34.265
Chef Ramsay wrong.

41:34.332 --> 41:35.466
I just want him
to eat his words.

41:35.534 --> 41:37.401
I want to show him

41:37.469 --> 41:38.402
there is a fire in me

41:38.470 --> 41:39.537
and that I deserve to be here.

41:39.604 --> 41:41.772
(Ed)
I feel very nervous

41:41.840 --> 41:43.307
because you got
to really turn it up a notch.

41:43.375 --> 41:45.543
But I'm gonna be more careful
with everything I do.

41:45.610 --> 41:47.478
I'm not going in the hot tub
tonight, that's for sure.

41:47.546 --> 41:50.247
(Gordon) Siobhan got
pushed around a lot in Hell's Kitchen.

41:50.315 --> 41:52.383
So it was up to me
to finally push her out.

41:59.591 --> 42:01.859
<i>(Announcer)
Next time on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:01.927 --> 42:03.227
(Gordon)
It's time

42:03.295 --> 42:04.762
for the blind taste test.

42:04.829 --> 42:06.330
<i>(Announcer) A highly
anticipated challenge...</i>

42:06.398 --> 42:07.498
Who has got
the best palate?

42:07.566 --> 42:08.899
- I have a good palate.
- Give me a break.

42:08.967 --> 42:10.634
I know Fran doesn't have
a better palate than me.

42:10.702 --> 42:11.802
<i>(Announcer)
ends in disaster.</i>

42:11.870 --> 42:12.870
- Roast beef?
- What?

42:12.938 --> 42:14.271
Almonds.
[bleep].

42:14.339 --> 42:15.906
- Prunes.
- No, damn!

42:15.974 --> 42:17.274
<i>(Announcer)
At dinner...</i>

42:17.342 --> 42:19.243
It's crispy and burned
and tastes like [bleep].

42:19.311 --> 42:20.444
<i>(Announcer)
tensions boil over.</i>

42:20.512 --> 42:21.779
Can you please
get out of my way?

42:21.846 --> 42:22.980
Fran's just crazy,

42:23.048 --> 42:24.214
and I don't want her
[bleep] near me.

42:24.282 --> 42:25.449
<i>(Announcer)
Rivalries turn to hatred.</i>

42:25.517 --> 42:26.650
Okay.
Get the [bleep] out.

42:35.360 --> 42:36.894
Where's the pork?
Do you wanna go home?
