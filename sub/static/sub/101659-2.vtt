Your husband has blood

He's developed
heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia.

We need to stop
the heparin.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.862

put him at risk
for another clot?

13:14.995 --> 13:16.964
Yes, if he's not
on the heparin,

13:17.097 --> 13:18.665
he could
have a stroke,

13:18.798 --> 13:20.968
and if he's on it,
he could have
a fatal internal bleed,

13:21.101 --> 13:22.402
and he still has
an infection,

13:22.535 --> 13:24.071
so we can't stop
the antibiotics

13:24.204 --> 13:25.338
