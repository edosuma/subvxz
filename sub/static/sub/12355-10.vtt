WEBVTT

00:08.146 --> 00:09.679
Previously on <i>House of Lies</i>...

00:09.680 --> 00:10.846
This,

00:10.923 --> 00:12.156
"W-O-N" stands

00:12.157 --> 00:14.923
for "wholesome,
organic nutrition."

00:15.957 --> 00:17.156
This is a grand slam.

00:17.157 --> 00:18.456
I just need your team

00:18.457 --> 00:20.090
to get me to that IPO, and...

00:21.357 --> 00:25.756
Until you can get
your shit together, we're done.

00:25.757 --> 00:26.789
<i>Go to the board,</i>

00:26.790 --> 00:28.222
tell them you're stepping aside

00:28.223 --> 00:30.189
for personal reasons, and ask
that they vote Marissa

00:30.190 --> 00:31.389
to be the new chairwoman.

00:31.390 --> 00:32.522
And just turn everything over

00:32.523 --> 00:35.322
to our little junkie sister who
treats rehab like winter vacation.

00:35.323 --> 00:37.022
Oh, we're gonna need
to move this along,

00:37.023 --> 00:38.656
'cause this is usually
when I shoot up.

00:38.657 --> 00:40.956
Well, there's no fucking way
you guys make it to an IPO now.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.222
Yeah.

00:42.223 --> 00:43.756
There's no way you can go public
with either one of you

00:43.757 --> 00:45.122
being the face of the company.

00:45.123 --> 00:46.456
But we can make it work

00:46.457 --> 00:48.022
because you don't have
any other choice.

00:48.023 --> 00:49.656
Well, I know one
thing's for sure.

00:49.657 --> 00:51.289
We're not gonna be
the blood brothers

00:51.290 --> 00:52.989
on the corners
that we once were.

00:52.990 --> 00:54.690
Damn sure ain't brothers
no more.

00:57.490 --> 01:01.022
<i>These assholes</i>
<i>and their Prop 8 bullshit.</i>

01:01.023 --> 01:02.856
When I think
about the courage you had,

01:02.857 --> 01:06.522
coming out to us in college, and
this is where we are in society?

01:06.523 --> 01:08.656
It's enough to move
out of the state.

01:08.657 --> 01:10.422
Okay.

01:10.423 --> 01:12.789
How are you and Kate?

01:12.790 --> 01:15.456
Not so great, Jeannie.
We broke up two years ago.

01:15.457 --> 01:18.622
Whoa. Are you seeing anyone new?

01:18.623 --> 01:21.656
Look, Jeannie, I know you don't
do social calls, that's fine.

01:21.657 --> 01:25.256
Pretending like that's what
this is... a little insulting.

01:25.257 --> 01:27.522
So, what can I do for you?

01:27.523 --> 01:29.722
The Department of
Justice is taking bids

01:29.723 --> 01:31.589
on a new consulting contract

01:31.590 --> 01:34.022
that Kaan & Associates
would be perfect for.

01:34.023 --> 01:36.489
And I just thought,
with your appointment

01:36.490 --> 01:38.256
to Special Assistant
Attorney General...

01:38.257 --> 01:39.689
congrats on that, by the way...

01:39.690 --> 01:41.122
Thank you.

01:41.123 --> 01:44.689
--if there was anything that
you could do to help us land it,

01:44.690 --> 01:50.689
I would just be, um...
really, really grateful.

01:50.690 --> 01:52.789
Wow. Really?

01:52.790 --> 01:55.489
I'm sorry. It's a force of habit.
Mm-hmm.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.722
This is a big contract.

01:56.723 --> 01:59.256
I always thought
of you guys as more boutique.

01:59.257 --> 02:01.789
Well, we're growing fast.
We just signed McClintock Media.

02:01.790 --> 02:04.522
Um, we have
U.S. National Bank,

02:04.523 --> 02:06.356
DollaHyde Apparel,
Colossal Foods...

02:06.357 --> 02:07.989
DollaHyde?

02:07.990 --> 02:09.622
As in Dre Collins
and Lukas Frye DollaHyde?

02:09.622 --> 02:11.222
You know them?

02:11.223 --> 02:13.322
Yeah, and not 'cause
I'm such a big swag whore.

02:13.323 --> 02:15.056
When I was
at the D.A.'s Office,

02:15.057 --> 02:17.389
Lukas Frye was a major fixture
in the drug world.

02:17.390 --> 02:19.289
He still is.

02:19.290 --> 02:21.257
I don't know anything
about that.

02:22.657 --> 02:24.156
That will be the last time

02:24.157 --> 02:26.922
I insult your intelligence, I promise.

02:26.923 --> 02:28.656
Look, Jeannie,
I could make a few calls

02:28.657 --> 02:29.822
and get you this contract.

02:29.823 --> 02:31.222
I mean, hell, I want to.

02:31.223 --> 02:34.122
Having someone with your ambition
owing me a favor this big?

02:34.123 --> 02:36.089
But? But you are in business
with a drug dealer.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.922
This is a contract
with the Department of Justice.

02:37.923 --> 02:39.122
It's a non-starter.

02:39.123 --> 02:42.322
What if we dropped DollaHyde?

02:42.323 --> 02:44.222
Well, then, we'd be in business.

02:44.223 --> 02:46.056
But you better drop 'em soon.

02:46.057 --> 02:49.022
Like, today.
The longer you wait,

02:49.023 --> 02:51.322
the harder it is
to sell your shock and outrage

02:51.323 --> 02:53.856
at the discovery
of their situation.

02:53.857 --> 02:55.189
All right.

02:55.190 --> 02:56.522
I will be in touch.

02:56.523 --> 02:58.189
What? Wait a second.
Where you going?

02:58.190 --> 03:00.522
Don't you want to see
some pictures of my niece?

03:00.523 --> 03:02.823
I deserve that.

03:06.182 --> 03:09.236
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

03:09.257 --> 03:11.722
Hey.
Hey. We got

03:11.723 --> 03:13.722
to go over these DollaHyde
projections before

03:13.723 --> 03:14.989
the Bloomingdale's meeting.

03:14.990 --> 03:18.523
Okay, I have news, and
you're gonna want to sit down.

03:20.657 --> 03:23.322
Oh, no. Wait a minute.

03:23.323 --> 03:25.956
Jeannie, how many times do
I have to say it? Birth control.

03:25.957 --> 03:27.622
No. No.
No?

03:27.623 --> 03:29.156
This is good news.
Oh.

03:29.157 --> 03:32.989
I think that I just landed us
a multiyear contract

03:32.990 --> 03:34.856
with the Department of Justice.

03:34.857 --> 03:36.556
That is huge.
Yes.

03:36.557 --> 03:41.356
And the small caveat is
that we need to dump DollaHyde,

03:41.357 --> 03:42.622
like, today.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.289
Oh, so that's a <i> big</i> caveat.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.856
Well...

03:45.857 --> 03:47.522
my connection made it very clear

03:47.523 --> 03:49.522
that they're not interested in...
A friend? It's a friend?

03:49.523 --> 03:53.089
Yes. A friend, and
she's very high up over there.

03:53.090 --> 03:55.556
Well, she must be
atmos-fuckin'-pheric

03:55.557 --> 03:57.956
if she can just hand out
government contracts like that.

03:57.957 --> 04:00.122
You know, there's usually
a whole process that...

04:00.123 --> 04:01.756
That's the point, Marty.
That's why we need

04:01.757 --> 04:03.189
to dump DollaHyde...
for the vetting process.

04:03.190 --> 04:04.556
Marty, do you have any idea?

04:04.557 --> 04:06.489
This would put us
in a league with

04:06.490 --> 04:09.089
Kinsley, with DeMark,
with Galweather.

04:09.090 --> 04:12.556
Or with the Galweather
before I destroyed them.

04:12.557 --> 04:14.722
Well, look, I appreciate the effort.
Fuck the effort.

04:14.723 --> 04:16.656
Appreciate the accomplishment.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.522
Jeannie, I don't think
this is the time

04:18.523 --> 04:20.956
to jettison
a top-tier client just because

04:20.957 --> 04:22.256
a friend of yours Marty...

04:22.257 --> 04:23.822
promised you some big contract.

04:23.823 --> 04:25.256
I...
Listen,

04:25.257 --> 04:26.622
DollaHyde is about
to pay dividends.

04:26.623 --> 04:28.289
Do you understand that?

04:28.290 --> 04:29.856
Do you really think,

04:29.857 --> 04:31.556
after everything
that happened in Compton,

04:31.557 --> 04:33.356
this little detente

04:33.357 --> 04:35.589
between Lukas and Dre
is really gonna stick?

04:35.590 --> 04:37.589
Now is the time
to cut our losses.

04:37.590 --> 04:40.289
After everything
that's happened,

04:40.290 --> 04:42.022
we are this close
to the finish line.

04:42.023 --> 04:44.289
Doesn't...
Listen, let's just take the meeting

04:44.290 --> 04:46.622
with Bloomingdale's, and then
we'll see where we're at.

04:46.623 --> 04:48.522
Okay.
Okay.

04:48.523 --> 04:50.057
Yeah, okay.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:17.323 --> 05:19.389
What are you doing?

05:19.390 --> 05:20.789
Rubbing your shoulders.

05:20.790 --> 05:22.656
It helps soothe my mother
when she's upset.

05:22.657 --> 05:24.156
I'm fine, thank you.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.256
You don't look fine.

05:25.257 --> 05:27.589
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
she said she's fine, all right?

05:27.590 --> 05:29.489
Don't you have a creepy motel
to go run?

05:29.490 --> 05:33.489
Yeah. 'Cause fuck me
for caring, right?

05:33.490 --> 05:36.389
Good Lord, get out of here.

05:36.390 --> 05:38.556
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Don't you say...

05:38.557 --> 05:39.622
No.
It's so unprofessional.

05:39.623 --> 05:42.189
It's fine.
It's just...

05:42.190 --> 05:43.957
My boyfriend and I broke up
last night.

05:46.590 --> 05:48.389
S... S... Sucks.
That sucks.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.956
God...
I know.

05:49.957 --> 05:52.422
Yeah.
It's just, like, one bump in the road,

05:52.423 --> 05:53.622
and he was just out.

05:53.623 --> 05:55.389
It's typical. So t...

05:55.390 --> 05:57.889
God, that just ticks me off.

05:57.890 --> 06:00.023
Hey, you know what?
You know what?

06:01.423 --> 06:05.022
I'm kind of going through
the same thing with my wife.

06:05.023 --> 06:07.056
God, what am I saying?

06:07.057 --> 06:08.889
My, um,<i> former</i> wife.

06:08.890 --> 06:11.656
You can still work things out.

06:11.657 --> 06:13.689
No, thank you. Thank...

06:13.690 --> 06:15.589
No, no, no.

06:15.590 --> 06:17.522
I think that ship has sailed.

06:17.523 --> 06:21.056
Yeah. Looks like you and I
are in the same boat.

06:21.057 --> 06:24.322
Snug, tight little boat.

06:24.323 --> 06:26.189
I'm so sorry.

06:26.190 --> 06:27.389
Oh, don't say that.

06:27.390 --> 06:28.756
I should be saying sorry to you.

06:28.757 --> 06:30.557
You're the one going
through a fresh breakup.

06:40.157 --> 06:43.089
Hey, you know what we should do?

06:43.090 --> 06:44.356
We should go out tonight.

06:44.357 --> 06:45.456
Yeah.

06:45.457 --> 06:46.789
Take our minds off things.

06:46.790 --> 06:48.856
I don't know
if I would be any fun.

06:48.857 --> 06:50.289
Okay, so, what are we gonna do?

06:50.290 --> 06:52.622
Sit at home alone, in the dark,
staring at the walls?

06:52.623 --> 06:54.356
I mean, no.

06:54.357 --> 06:56.722
We're gonna let those people,
those people who have vastly

06:56.723 --> 06:58.656
disappointed us, those...

06:58.657 --> 07:02.456
dare I say,
emotional terrorists... win?

07:02.457 --> 07:05.789
You know what?

07:05.790 --> 07:06.822
You're right.

07:06.823 --> 07:09.389
Uh-huh.
Let's go out tonight.

07:09.390 --> 07:10.689
Yeah, I think...
Yeah.

07:10.690 --> 07:11.922
I think it's probably good.

07:11.923 --> 07:13.256
I think it's good.
Yeah.

07:13.257 --> 07:14.657
Thank you.

07:16.223 --> 07:18.357
I think so. Yeah.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.456
Be cool, Doug. Be cool.

07:22.457 --> 07:24.390
Don't shit the bed on this one.

07:29.090 --> 07:32.822
Oh. Listen, I love it
when you come to town,

07:32.823 --> 07:35.022
but you are a master
of distraction.

07:35.023 --> 07:37.089
Well, then this shouldn't come
as a surprise.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.156
Do you remember when
you were in sober living

07:39.157 --> 07:41.489
because your siblings
concocted this insane lie

07:41.490 --> 07:44.222
that you had a drug problem?

07:44.223 --> 07:46.822
No, but this is just a little
treat while I'm on vacation.

07:46.823 --> 07:49.722
Oh. Okay, you know, you've been
in charge for two weeks, right?

07:49.723 --> 07:51.122
Right, and now

07:51.123 --> 07:52.889
I'm on vacation, so,
are you gonna join me or what?

07:52.890 --> 07:55.289
No, no. I'm really late
for work. I got to get going.

07:55.290 --> 07:57.656
Fuck work.
Are you serious?

07:57.657 --> 07:58.889
After everything
you've done for them?

07:58.890 --> 08:00.222
Fuck being late.
They should be

08:00.223 --> 08:01.389
sucking your dick right now.

08:01.390 --> 08:02.622
By the way, I'm with you, dude.

08:02.623 --> 08:03.856
I've been making the old

08:03.857 --> 08:06.689
"you guys should be sucking my dick"
argument for fucking years now.

08:06.690 --> 08:09.056
Here it is...
of course, next to the butter.

08:09.057 --> 08:12.022
Seriously, you brought them me,
the biggest piece of business.

08:12.023 --> 08:14.456
Not to mention,
the sweetest piece of ass.

08:14.457 --> 08:16.322
Stop deflecting.
But at the same time...

08:16.323 --> 08:18.656
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
They should be treating you like

08:18.657 --> 08:20.322
a king.
Yeah, well, we've already got a king.

08:20.323 --> 08:21.889
Fine, then at least a prince.

08:21.890 --> 08:23.122
But the handsome one
with the baby...

08:23.123 --> 08:25.556
not the creepy ginger...
nobody wants

08:25.557 --> 08:27.022
a creepy ginger.
Okay. Yeah.

08:27.023 --> 08:28.989
Okay, hey?
Yup.

08:28.990 --> 08:30.922
Come do some lines with me, or
McClintock Media's not gonna be

08:30.923 --> 08:33.289
needing the services
of Kaan & Associates.

08:33.289 --> 08:35.357
Really? Just like that, huh?

08:38.557 --> 08:40.256
You're kidding, right?

08:40.256 --> 08:42.556
That's a joke?
You're making funnies?

08:42.557 --> 08:43.688
Of course I'm kidding.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.922
I mean, I think I'm kidding.

08:45.923 --> 08:46.989
No.

08:46.990 --> 08:48.456
I am, I'm kidding.

08:48.457 --> 08:50.022
I'm totally kidding.
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

08:50.023 --> 08:51.489
Am I kidding?

08:51.490 --> 08:53.222
You know what?

08:53.223 --> 08:54.356
Fuck it.

08:54.357 --> 08:56.422
Move over.

08:56.423 --> 08:58.589
I'm about to treat your
pussy like a bad dog.

08:58.590 --> 09:00.222
Like a bad dog.
Get in here.

09:00.223 --> 09:01.823
Get in here!

09:08.290 --> 09:10.056
...Saks Fifth
Avenue, maybe H&M,

09:10.057 --> 09:12.056
we should be chillin',
you know what I mean?

09:12.057 --> 09:13.722
Mm-hmm, well, checking out
this here bottom line,

09:13.723 --> 09:14.922
I'm actually interested

09:14.923 --> 09:16.989
in hearing what
Barneys has to say.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.722
I'm with that.

09:19.723 --> 09:21.922
Fellas, fellas.

09:21.923 --> 09:23.289
Hey, what's happening?
Hey.

09:23.290 --> 09:24.922
Marty.

09:24.923 --> 09:27.322
So, uh, Jeannie is in with the
Bloomindgale's rep right now

09:27.323 --> 09:29.289
Oh.
going over some numbers.

09:29.290 --> 09:30.989
Mm. Is she?

09:30.990 --> 09:32.523
Let's do this.

09:34.823 --> 09:37.756
So, Dre, lis... listen,
I got to tell you, um...

09:37.757 --> 09:39.756
We got to make a fucking deal, man.

09:39.757 --> 09:41.922
I mean, Bloomingdale's today,

09:41.923 --> 09:43.689
got Barneys tomorrow,
H&M next week.

09:43.690 --> 09:46.256
Personally, I-I don't give a
fuck which one it is, but...

09:46.257 --> 09:49.456
this has to happen,
okay? Or... or I'm done.

09:49.457 --> 09:51.122
We're done.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.756
Look, whatever you have to do to
make the deal happen, all right?

09:53.757 --> 09:55.756
And, once again,
I really appreciate

09:55.757 --> 09:57.156
you sticking with
me through this.

09:57.157 --> 09:57.889
Yeah, you should.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.089
Let's do it.

09:59.090 --> 10:00.322
Now, look...

10:00.323 --> 10:02.522
about that whole...
Zhang incident,

10:02.523 --> 10:04.756
No... Let's just... Let's...
I just wanted to let you know I wasn't

10:04.757 --> 10:06.689
let's squash it. Let's squash it, okay?
On some bullshit.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.156
Fuck that, let's do this.

10:08.157 --> 10:10.123
Fuck it, let's do it.

10:11.357 --> 10:12.656
<i>Vincent, you have created</i>

10:12.657 --> 10:14.422
<i>an incredible product.</i>

10:14.423 --> 10:16.356
<i>And with it, we can</i>
<i>build you an empire.</i>

10:16.357 --> 10:18.789
<i>But not if you</i>
<i>tie my hands like this.</i>

10:18.790 --> 10:20.256
No, no, forget it, forget it.
If-if we just...

10:20.257 --> 10:22.189
No. If we make a real push
in the youth market

10:22.190 --> 10:23.856
where this product has
shown significant growth,

10:23.857 --> 10:27.589
then I really...
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:27.590 --> 10:29.922
The fact is college
kids are using this

10:29.923 --> 10:31.956
as a diet supplement
and an energy stimulant.

10:31.957 --> 10:33.422
And we would be crazy

10:33.423 --> 10:36.189
not to capitalize on that...
WON is not a diet supplement.

10:36.190 --> 10:37.956
It's not an energy
stimulant, okay?

10:37.957 --> 10:41.056
I-It's a <i> meal replacement,</i>
okay?

10:41.057 --> 10:42.789
Can you wrap your-your
little "material girl"

10:42.790 --> 10:44.789
brain around what that means?

10:44.790 --> 10:46.322
This product
could end world hunger!

10:46.323 --> 10:48.389
And you want to sell it
as an energy drink?

10:48.390 --> 10:49.922
Fuck... that.

10:49.923 --> 10:51.989
Uh-huh.
Fuck it.

10:51.990 --> 10:53.156
I agree, I agree...

10:53.157 --> 10:55.956
Dinner... that's
the play, right?

10:55.957 --> 10:58.157
I'd think so... I mean,
you can sit, talk, connect.

10:59.523 --> 11:01.189
Or is that
a little cliché? Maybe.

11:01.190 --> 11:04.456
Ooh, there is that, uh, Fellini
retrospective on at the Egyptian.

11:04.457 --> 11:05.956
You know what?
I bet she'd love that.

11:05.957 --> 11:06.756
That feels better.
Yeah.

11:06.757 --> 11:09.589
Don't you think?
Clyde? Hello?

11:09.590 --> 11:12.056
Clyde, are you listening?
What? Yes, I'm listening.
I am absolutely listening.

11:12.057 --> 11:14.022
Caitlin's in a vulnerable place,
so you're gonna try to use that

11:14.023 --> 11:15.956
to fuck her brains out,
I got you, so shut the fuck up.

11:15.957 --> 11:19.789
How dare you! Don't cheapen it.
No, uh, uh-uh. How dare <i> you!</i>

11:19.790 --> 11:21.656
Okay? You don't just
fuck a girl like Caitlin. Oh, my God,

11:21.657 --> 11:23.489
I'm so sorry, Polite Doug.

11:23.490 --> 11:25.122
Um, make love her brains out.

11:25.123 --> 11:26.889
No. That's not what's going on here.
No?

11:26.890 --> 11:29.089
Then what is it?
Uh, Caitlin and I happen to have

11:29.090 --> 11:30.130
a very special connection.

11:33.721 --> 11:35.922
You're a fucking child. I'm not.
You're a fucking child.

11:35.923 --> 11:37.756
You are.
Okay? Is it a coincidence

11:37.757 --> 11:38.956
that Sarah and I have separated

11:38.957 --> 11:41.656
at the exact same time that Caitlin's
broken up with her boyfriend?

11:41.657 --> 11:43.389
I think not.
I think not. I think so.

11:43.390 --> 11:44.656
I think so.
I think not.

11:44.657 --> 11:46.289
♪ I think so... ♪
♪ I think not... ♪

11:46.290 --> 11:48.189
♪ Oh... ♪
♪ Not... ♪

11:48.190 --> 11:49.656
That was pretty cool, actually.
Nice. Okay.

11:49.657 --> 11:51.756
Who is that guy, by the way,
going toe-to-toe

11:51.757 --> 11:54.089
with the dragon lady?
Oh, shit, that's Vincent.

11:54.090 --> 11:56.322
The-the-the creator of WON.
What is that?

11:56.323 --> 11:59.122
Is that that brown, disgusting
stuff you drink like come?

11:59.123 --> 12:01.356
Uh, okay, that disgusting, brown drink
that I guzzle down like come

12:01.357 --> 12:03.922
has saved me from having to
purchase a meal in over a week,

12:03.923 --> 12:05.322
so I'll take the come.
I can't believe

12:05.323 --> 12:07.022
Marty took her on
as a client, man.

12:07.023 --> 12:08.522
That's bullshit.
That's a slap in the face,

12:08.523 --> 12:09.922
is what that is, man.
After all the fuckin' work

12:09.923 --> 12:11.522
I've done for this company,
now he has the balls

12:11.523 --> 12:12.556
to just bring that fuckin' bitch back.
Shh, shh.

12:12.557 --> 12:14.056
Would you calm down?

12:14.057 --> 12:16.622
Get the fuck out of my face.
Okay, okay.

12:16.623 --> 12:18.156
Oh, God, he looks pissed.
That's not good.

12:18.157 --> 12:19.856
He must have found out
about the focus groups today.

12:19.857 --> 12:22.222
What is that?
What focus groups?

12:22.223 --> 12:23.789
Well, Monica's exploring market
segmentation strategies,

12:23.790 --> 12:26.222
so she asked me to set up
these focus group testing,

12:26.223 --> 12:27.989
but Vincent would be pissed
if he found out about it.

12:27.990 --> 12:30.456
Oh, God, she's coming this way,
she's coming this way.

12:30.457 --> 12:32.656
Monica, I swear I didn't say
a word about the focus groups.

12:32.657 --> 12:33.856
He doesn't know anything.

12:33.857 --> 12:35.422
Now, if you're done
shitting yourself,

12:35.423 --> 12:36.756
you follow me.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.522
What is that? Why?

12:39.523 --> 12:40.656
Oh, I don't know.

12:40.657 --> 12:41.722
You're just, you're funny.

12:41.723 --> 12:43.522
Like a...
not in a funny ha-ha way,

12:43.523 --> 12:44.622
but more of, like,

12:44.623 --> 12:46.256
a sad-clown funny.
Oh...

12:46.257 --> 12:48.356
Come on.

12:48.357 --> 12:49.890
Let's get to work.

12:54.123 --> 12:56.322
Hey, Vincent? Vincent?

12:56.323 --> 12:57.922
Vincent?
What's going on, man?

12:57.923 --> 12:59.789
I'm Clyde Oberholt.
I'm a huge fan.

12:59.790 --> 13:02.056
Why don't you let me
buy you lunch, huh? What?

13:02.057 --> 13:04.022
I don't eat lunch.
Okay, right, of course.

13:04.023 --> 13:05.789
You're a genius...
why would you eat lunch?

13:05.790 --> 13:07.856
Why don't you watch me eat?

13:07.857 --> 13:09.356
This, like, a sex thing, or...?

13:09.357 --> 13:11.622
No. No, but it'll still
be worth your while.

13:11.623 --> 13:14.089
I promise.

13:14.090 --> 13:17.489
What you've created here
is very impressive.

13:17.490 --> 13:19.156
I appreciate that.

13:19.157 --> 13:21.656
Well, you know, you won't
find a tighter-run ship

13:21.657 --> 13:23.356
in the apparel industry.

13:23.357 --> 13:25.022
And that ain't braggin'.
That's all due

13:25.023 --> 13:27.156
to the business acumen
of my man Dre here.

13:27.157 --> 13:30.456
However, it isn't business

13:30.457 --> 13:32.922
that Bloomingdale's is
interested in, is it?

13:32.923 --> 13:35.589
It's the very swagger
and essence...

13:35.590 --> 13:37.289
that <i> is</i> DollaHyde.

13:37.290 --> 13:38.889
And that, I must say,

13:38.890 --> 13:40.189
would be me.

13:40.190 --> 13:42.556
If we were to strike
a deal, Mr. Vincent,

13:42.557 --> 13:44.356
I would need a say

13:44.357 --> 13:47.622
over our marketing
and our presence in your store.

13:47.623 --> 13:50.223
You want final approval
on our floor displays.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.622
Well, I can't have you
fuckin' up my essence,

13:54.623 --> 13:55.956
now, can I, Mr. Vincent?

13:55.957 --> 13:57.889
And that would be
a deal breaker.

13:57.890 --> 13:59.456
Mr. Vincent,
DollaHyde has

13:59.457 --> 14:02.889
been in double-digit growth
in its profit margin

14:02.890 --> 14:04.456
since its inception.

14:04.457 --> 14:06.889
What Lukas is offering you
isn't a deal <i> breaker,</i>

14:06.890 --> 14:08.090
it's a deal <i> maker.</i>

14:12.790 --> 14:15.557
Okay. We could
make that work.

14:17.623 --> 14:20.656
All right, so first thing you
got to do is change the taste,

14:20.657 --> 14:23.256
'cause it tastes like
fuckin'... ass.

14:23.257 --> 14:25.089
I kind of like the taste.

14:25.090 --> 14:27.189
Does anyone else hate the taste?
Oh, my God! Monica,

14:27.190 --> 14:28.556
we are shocked!

14:28.557 --> 14:31.389
Shocked that there's focus group
testing going on in here!

14:31.390 --> 14:32.622
Vincent!

14:32.623 --> 14:34.989
We are just collecting data.

14:34.990 --> 14:36.222
It's very standard.

14:36.223 --> 14:38.222
Okay, also, my friend says that

14:38.223 --> 14:40.189
it makes his girlfriend
super horny.

14:40.190 --> 14:41.789
Is-is he full of shit?

14:41.790 --> 14:43.122
Uh, Vincent...
Uh, it's...

14:43.123 --> 14:45.822
it's a... it's...
Vincent...

14:45.823 --> 14:47.089
All right, next question...

14:47.090 --> 14:50.289
I am going to literally
kill you for this.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.456
You might want to put a leash on
your former meal ticket first.

14:52.457 --> 14:54.756
- Fuck you!
- Fuck...

14:54.757 --> 14:56.989
you, you fuckin' asshole!

14:56.990 --> 14:59.922
No, do not look at me like that.
Fuck her.

14:59.923 --> 15:01.389
This has been
a long time coming.

15:01.390 --> 15:03.289
All that shit she put me through?
Okay, yeah, but you know

15:03.290 --> 15:05.289
she's gonna tell Marty.
Yes, fine, and he'll have a good laugh.

15:05.290 --> 15:07.656
I don't think so, man.
Fine! If he doesn't, then fuck him!

15:07.657 --> 15:08.889
Fuck him?
Yes!

15:08.890 --> 15:10.422
What's the matter with you?
N... Oh.

15:10.423 --> 15:12.556
You're acting crazy.
Just take a breath. Why?

15:12.557 --> 15:14.456
Why should I take
a fucking breath?

15:14.457 --> 15:17.022
Because it took you a long time
to get out of Marty's doghouse.

15:17.023 --> 15:19.322
Okay? It wasn't easy,
but you did it, huh?

15:19.323 --> 15:21.589
Who let the dogs out, huh?
You! You!

15:21.590 --> 15:23.122
You! You! You!
No, no, no, no.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.622
That business that
Monica's bringing him,

15:24.623 --> 15:26.056
that's fucking
penny-ante bullshit

15:26.057 --> 15:27.922
compared to the work
that I brought to Marty,

15:27.923 --> 15:29.156
so I feel like
I earned this moment.

15:29.157 --> 15:31.222
Okay! If you take that away
from me, fuck you, man!

15:31.223 --> 15:32.589
Focus group over!
Everybody...

15:32.590 --> 15:34.722
get out!
Thank you very much.

15:34.723 --> 15:36.122
Sorry, who's this?

15:36.123 --> 15:38.889
Who am I? I'm the guy
about to end world hunger.

15:38.890 --> 15:40.556
You're the assholes
with nothing better to do

15:40.557 --> 15:43.222
in the middle of the afternoon
on a fucking Wednesday.

15:43.223 --> 15:45.422
And I'm so sorry, bro,

15:45.423 --> 15:47.122
guess you'll have
to stick with Rohypnol

15:47.123 --> 15:49.156
and Zima to get laid, man.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.756
What the fuck is Zima?

15:50.757 --> 15:52.256
What's Zima?

15:52.257 --> 15:53.322
Man, you haven't lived.

15:53.323 --> 15:54.822
Okay, Vincent,

15:54.823 --> 15:56.089
I think you made your point.

15:56.090 --> 15:57.422
No, no, here's my point.

15:57.423 --> 15:58.822
Fuck him!

15:58.823 --> 16:00.222
Fuck them!

16:00.223 --> 16:01.089
Yes.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.722
And most of all, fuck... you!

16:03.723 --> 16:04.889
Hm.

16:04.890 --> 16:05.789
Oh...

16:05.790 --> 16:07.889
And that's...

16:07.890 --> 16:09.056
the ball game.

16:09.057 --> 16:10.189
Holy shit.

16:10.190 --> 16:11.656
I'm so happy you could see it.

16:11.657 --> 16:13.989
Damn it!

16:13.990 --> 16:15.756
Damn it!

16:15.757 --> 16:16.789
Thank you.

16:16.790 --> 16:17.922
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

16:17.923 --> 16:19.056
My, my my.

16:19.057 --> 16:21.322
That could not have gone better,

16:21.323 --> 16:23.122
could it?
All right.

16:23.123 --> 16:25.422
Now who's looking out
for that DollaHyde name?

16:25.423 --> 16:26.922
You looking out for
that DollaHyde name.

16:26.923 --> 16:28.222
Goddamn right.
So we have

16:28.223 --> 16:29.822
Barneys tomorrow, right?
Yep.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.422
Well, hey, man, why don't we go
and have us a little dinner.

16:32.423 --> 16:35.056
My treat. We could do a little
strategizing and whatnot, man,

16:35.057 --> 16:37.089
and I'll put down
for somewhere fancy...

16:37.090 --> 16:39.156
don't even worry about it, Dre.
Somewhere chi-chi enough

16:39.157 --> 16:40.789
that they serve that dish

16:40.790 --> 16:42.622
that they banned everywhere
that Dre likes so much.

16:42.623 --> 16:45.489
What the fuck is it called, the one
with the exploding ducks and shit?

16:45.490 --> 16:46.656
Foie gras.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.656
Yeah, man!
"Four-a-gwah," man.

16:48.657 --> 16:49.756
We gonna have some

16:49.757 --> 16:52.256
"four-a-gwah" for
my man Dre here, man.

16:52.257 --> 16:54.856
Hey, uh, Marty, Jeannie,
expect a call from my secretary,

16:54.857 --> 16:57.856
'cause they will be hitting you
up with the details, all right?

16:57.857 --> 16:59.822
- See you guys later?
- Great.

16:59.823 --> 17:02.922
Hey, which one of y'all
motherfuckers is my secretary?

17:02.923 --> 17:04.521
To my office, expeditiously.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.955
Goddamn Lukas... I'm telling you
that motherfucker is a trip.

17:06.957 --> 17:09.556
And you're okay with
what just happened?

17:09.557 --> 17:11.689
Being marginalized?

17:11.690 --> 17:13.990
You think because I was laughing
that I'm okay with it?

17:15.060 --> 17:16.622
Way to keep the deal
in play, Marty boy.

17:16.623 --> 17:19.122
Good shit, as always.

17:19.123 --> 17:20.321
Thank you.

17:20.323 --> 17:21.556
See you at dinner?

17:21.557 --> 17:22.589
Yeah.
Dinner it is.

17:26.656 --> 17:28.156
Unbelievable.

17:28.156 --> 17:29.989
Yeah, "being marginalized"?
You have to say that?

17:29.990 --> 17:32.589
We're still not dumping them?
After that?

17:32.590 --> 17:35.522
Listen, we are way past the
point of no return with them.

17:35.523 --> 17:38.556
The only way to get through
this fucking quagmire is to
No, we're not...

17:38.557 --> 17:41.622
push through.
Are you really trying to sell me
that this is what's best

17:41.623 --> 17:44.663
for our company, Marty?
Does everything has to be a
fucking argument with you?

17:47.457 --> 17:48.589
Okay.

17:48.590 --> 17:50.489
What? What does "okay" mean?

17:50.490 --> 17:53.857
Okay, I'm done arguing with you.

17:57.723 --> 17:59.057
Okay.

18:02.176 --> 18:04.256
He was fucking yelling at her,
really yelling at her,

18:04.257 --> 18:05.922
then out of nowhere, bam!

18:05.923 --> 18:07.989
Bitch slap.
A real bitch slap. Yeah?

18:07.990 --> 18:11.489
Partnership over.
It was fucking magnificent.
Yeah, that sounds great.

18:11.490 --> 18:14.822
Are you fucking serious? Stop.
That's all you have to say
to me? "It sounds great"?

18:14.823 --> 18:17.222
Yeah.
Are you nuts, dude? Haven't
you worked for her before?

18:17.223 --> 18:18.989
I never had a problem
with Monica.

18:18.990 --> 18:21.356
Of course you didn't have
a problem with Monica.
I didn't.

18:21.357 --> 18:23.789
Asshole!

18:23.790 --> 18:27.922
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

18:27.923 --> 18:29.856
No. Vincent. I had no idea
you were gonna be here, buddy.

18:29.857 --> 18:31.556
What's going on?
I have nothing to say to you, Clyde.

18:31.557 --> 18:33.122
No, we can chat
for a little bit, though.

18:33.123 --> 18:34.689
Vincent!
So...

18:34.690 --> 18:36.389
it's a funny story, actually.
I don't...

18:36.390 --> 18:39.189
After our little,
uh, mm, unpleasantness,

18:39.190 --> 18:40.956
Vincent saw the light.

18:40.957 --> 18:42.456
I'm usually so much better

18:42.457 --> 18:44.422
at spotting the ones that
need a good slap though.

18:44.423 --> 18:46.022
I don't know what happened.

18:46.023 --> 18:48.222
But anyways, he finally
opened up to the idea

18:48.223 --> 18:51.722
of soaking these college kids
for untold millions,

18:51.723 --> 18:53.589
which is a necessary evil

18:53.590 --> 18:55.456
to finance the changing
of the world.

18:55.457 --> 18:58.622
I'm gonna make so much

18:58.623 --> 19:01.656
fucking money off of this,

19:01.657 --> 19:04.056
and I just wanted to...

19:04.057 --> 19:05.456
thank you.

19:05.457 --> 19:07.189
Great. All right. Cool.

19:07.190 --> 19:08.822
All right.
Hmm.

19:08.823 --> 19:10.389
Oh, another piece of advice.

19:10.390 --> 19:12.289
What?

19:12.290 --> 19:14.122
Don't come to work high.

19:14.123 --> 19:16.289
Some people can pull it off.

19:16.290 --> 19:17.889
I can pull it off.

19:17.890 --> 19:21.222
You just look silly.

19:21.223 --> 19:23.756
The fuck ever happened
to karma, man?

19:23.757 --> 19:24.989
'Cause this is insane, dude.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.922
What the fuck ever
happened to karma

19:26.923 --> 19:29.122
because this is bullshit.
Do you see that?!

19:29.123 --> 19:31.556
You can do whatever the fuck
you want! It doesn't matter!

19:31.557 --> 19:33.523
Do whatever you want, guys!

19:40.490 --> 19:43.856
I love that this is becoming,
like, our little spot.

19:43.857 --> 19:45.989
We're not dropping DollaHyde.

19:45.990 --> 19:48.122
Okay.

19:48.123 --> 19:49.956
Then what are we doing here?

19:49.957 --> 19:53.056
What if I could deliver some
incriminating financial records

19:53.057 --> 19:54.856
on Lukas Frye and Dre Collins?

19:54.857 --> 19:57.789
Could we trade that for
the DOJ contract?

19:57.790 --> 19:59.122
Absolutely.

19:59.123 --> 20:01.723
Then that's what we'll do.

20:03.190 --> 20:05.289
What?

20:05.290 --> 20:07.489
What's your play here, Jeannie?

20:07.490 --> 20:09.122
I mean, don't get me wrong,

20:09.123 --> 20:10.956
I'll gladly take
what you're offering, but...

20:10.957 --> 20:13.189
it just seems like a messier way
to get what you want.

20:13.190 --> 20:15.123
Yes, it is.

20:18.290 --> 20:20.622
What are we gonna do tonight?
Okay.

20:20.623 --> 20:22.789
Well, I was thinking we get some dinner.
Mm-hmm.

20:22.790 --> 20:25.222
Uh, but there's a Fellini retrospective
on at the Egyptian later,

20:25.223 --> 20:27.789
if you're interested.
Oh, my God. Doug. Shut up.

20:27.790 --> 20:29.422
You shut up.
I love Fellini.

20:29.423 --> 20:30.789
I thought you might.

20:30.790 --> 20:32.622
Good night, guys.

20:32.623 --> 20:34.322
"Good night, guys."

20:34.323 --> 20:35.856
What the fuck is that?

20:35.857 --> 20:38.789
Um, I'm not sure.
I don't know.

20:38.790 --> 20:42.156
So, hey, uh, I'm just gonna grab
my stuff and let's make a move.

20:42.157 --> 20:45.156
Yeah.
Okay.

20:45.157 --> 20:47.856
So, what do you think of Will?

20:47.857 --> 20:49.522
Will?
Yeah.

20:49.523 --> 20:51.722
Uh, Will's... the worst.

20:51.723 --> 20:54.156
So... I mean, why are
we talking about Will?

20:54.157 --> 20:56.856
Okay... because he's
kind of the reason

20:56.857 --> 20:58.922
that my boyfriend
broke up with me.

20:58.923 --> 21:02.289
We were drunk on the road
one night and we hooked up.

21:02.290 --> 21:04.022
And it was a huge mistake.

21:04.023 --> 21:05.989
Huh.

21:05.990 --> 21:08.756
Okay. Naughty.

21:08.757 --> 21:12.056
But, uh, you know, a-as long
as you learned from it, right?

21:12.057 --> 21:14.356
Yeah. No, I definitely
know better than to hook up
Yeah.

21:14.357 --> 21:16.889
with someone at work.
Ooh, no... hold on... I'll stop you there.

21:16.890 --> 21:18.856
I don't think that's
the lesson, actually.
No, I mean, he's cute, but...

21:18.857 --> 21:20.556
Is he though?
I don't really see it.

21:20.557 --> 21:23.922
But he cost me a relationship
with a really great guy.

21:23.923 --> 21:25.556
Mmm.

21:25.557 --> 21:28.189
God, I guess that Chicago trip
was really a disaster

21:28.190 --> 21:30.090
for both of us.

21:33.590 --> 21:35.889
Hold on. You... you and...

21:35.890 --> 21:39.056
- you and Will hooked up in, uh...
- in Chicago?

21:39.057 --> 21:40.989
Yeah.

21:40.990 --> 21:42.922
You know what, I shouldn't
have brought this up.

21:42.923 --> 21:46.189
Can we just forget about it?
Yeah. Right.

21:46.190 --> 21:48.922
I'm sorry. But when-when
did you have the time?

21:48.923 --> 21:51.022
Just because we were together
for so much of it.

21:51.023 --> 21:52.989
We went to the art exhibit,
and I'm just trying to think Doug...

21:52.990 --> 21:54.656
of when you squeezed him in, so to speak.
Can we not?

21:54.657 --> 21:56.489
But... Yeah. Mm-hmm.

21:56.490 --> 21:58.822
Sure. Not another word.

21:58.823 --> 22:01.157
So...

22:02.857 --> 22:04.857
Chicago...

22:06.423 --> 22:09.122
Right under my fucking nose.
You know,

22:09.123 --> 22:10.722
Doug, um...

22:10.723 --> 22:13.089
I'm not really sure
what you want from me here,

22:13.090 --> 22:15.222
but I could really
just use a friend right now.

22:15.223 --> 22:17.122
Okay, well...

22:17.123 --> 22:19.556
maybe you should've thought
of that before you...

22:19.557 --> 22:21.822
went and fucked Will
in Chicago, okay?

22:21.823 --> 22:23.589
Oh, my God.

22:23.590 --> 22:25.189
I can't believe this.

22:25.190 --> 22:27.189
You were gonna use
my painful breakup,

22:27.190 --> 22:28.722
your separation from your wife

22:28.723 --> 22:30.822
to manipulate me?
So that

22:30.823 --> 22:33.322
you could do what,
try to fuck me?

22:33.323 --> 22:35.122
I... No. Okay, no. All right?

22:35.123 --> 22:36.722
I was gonna wait a respectful

22:36.723 --> 22:39.956
amount of time before...
Wow. You know what, Doug, fuck you, okay?

22:39.957 --> 22:42.756
You're the emotional terrorist.

22:42.757 --> 22:44.256
<i>I'm</i> the emotional terrorist?

22:44.257 --> 22:46.122
That's what I said!

22:46.123 --> 22:48.122
Well, you... you're...

22:48.123 --> 22:50.456
You're... Um...

22:50.457 --> 22:53.222
Come on.

22:53.223 --> 22:55.789
Your pussy's
ground zero... shit.

22:55.790 --> 22:58.956
Shit!

22:58.957 --> 23:00.389
Hey.

23:00.390 --> 23:02.856
Hey... Hey, I have moved
from this spot

23:02.857 --> 23:04.422
since you last saw me.
I was on a conference call

23:04.423 --> 23:06.789
for, like, at least an hour.
What are you doing tomorrow?

23:06.790 --> 23:07.989
What? Nothing.

23:07.990 --> 23:08.922
I'm in.

23:08.923 --> 23:10.122
Do you have any more coke?

23:10.123 --> 23:11.123
How dare you.

23:11.957 --> 23:13.456
Of course I have more coke.

23:13.457 --> 23:14.423
Get it out. Let's go.

23:25.948 --> 23:28.189
I'm telling you, the dinner
must have weighed like, what,

23:28.190 --> 23:31.156
200 pounds...
we still outran the fat fuck.
Yeah, yeah.

23:31.157 --> 23:32.789
Y'all are all right, man.

23:32.790 --> 23:35.489
Oh, will you look at who
decides to join us finally.

23:35.490 --> 23:36.922
Oh, very sorry I'm late.

23:36.923 --> 23:39.056
Well, Lukas took the liberty
of ordering for you.

23:39.057 --> 23:40.389
Yes, I did...
I got you

23:40.390 --> 23:42.889
the duck breast...
I remember how much you liked it

23:42.890 --> 23:44.689
last time, and this
place even has

23:44.690 --> 23:46.356
maple and shit in theirs.
Wow.

23:46.357 --> 23:48.656
It's even got maple and shit
in theirs, you hear that,

23:48.657 --> 23:50.689
Jeannie? I heard. Thank you.
That's very thoughtful.

23:50.690 --> 23:53.623
Well, you're very welcome,
and you are well worth the wait.

23:56.890 --> 23:58.456
Mmm.

23:58.457 --> 24:00.690
Eat up.

24:07.523 --> 24:11.090
Oh, God.

24:13.390 --> 24:15.122
Once.
Oh.

24:15.123 --> 24:17.389
Okay? Once we hooked up.
Once.

24:17.390 --> 24:19.456
Maybe a few times.
Oh!

24:19.457 --> 24:21.289
What is the big deal?
What?

24:21.290 --> 24:24.222
No, it's just interesting,
all the shit you were giving me

24:24.223 --> 24:26.922
about Dre being my good friend.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.989
I never fucked the dude.

24:28.990 --> 24:30.989
I never let it affect
my decision-making, Marty.

24:30.990 --> 24:32.456
I doubt that, I doubt that.

24:32.457 --> 24:34.022
Oh, Marty...

24:34.023 --> 24:35.322
you ain't that bad after all...

24:35.323 --> 24:37.289
I don't care what
nobody else say about you.

24:37.290 --> 24:38.722
I'll catch y'all at the...

24:38.723 --> 24:41.256
I'll catch y'all at the Barneys meeting.
Yeah.

24:41.257 --> 24:42.656
A'ight, now.

24:42.657 --> 24:43.989
Mm-hmm.

24:43.990 --> 24:46.389
You picking up what I'm putting down.
Oh, boy.

24:46.390 --> 24:49.057
God, he's so cute.
