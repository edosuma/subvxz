00:10.010 --> 00:12.240
I know we haven't been
formally introduced...

00:12.412 --> 00:15.942
...but I was wondering.
when you get off from work...

00:16.116 --> 00:18.176
...if you haven't made
any dinner p|ans...?

It says here they're down to
three candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:38.004 --> 00:41.134
I would kill for one of those.

00:42.541 --> 00:45.031
I don't know how to be delicate.
but it would seem...

00:45.211 --> 00:49.881
...that one of the prerequisites for winning
a humanitarian award is that you be....

00:50.049 --> 00:51.919
Human.

00:53.451 --> 00:56.151
Why are you interested
in a Nobel Peace Prize. Dan?

00:56.654 --> 00:58.754
Career advancement.

00:59.357 --> 01:02.787
Of course.
I lost my head there for a second.

01:04.194 --> 01:07.095
Excuse me. I'm afraid I'm a little lost.

01:07.265 --> 01:09.095
I was wondering if you could direct me.

01:09.267 --> 01:13.427
Certainly. first left. take the corridor.
and then follow the yellow brick road.

01:19.878 --> 01:22.108

01:38.830 --> 01:43.030

02:54.605 --> 02:58.055
Florence. I was thinking.
before we rushed into things...

02:58.241 --> 03:02.641
...maybe it would be a good idea
if we got to know each other a little better.

03:03.580 --> 03:04.840
Why?

03:05.549 --> 03:09.489
Well. there are a million questions
I'd like to ask you.

03:09.653 --> 03:12.353
And I'm sure there are a million
you could ask me.

03:12.522 --> 03:17.322
Go ahead. ask me any little thing

03:30.204 --> 03:33.044

You ever discuss jurisprudence

I hate him.

03:56.395 --> 03:58.255
-Because?
-That job was mine.

03:58.430 --> 04:00.490
I busted my chops for years.
what do they do?

04:00.666 --> 04:04.156
-They give it to Santa's favorite elf.
-Oh. Dan.

04:04.336 --> 04:06.236
And then he lectures me.

04:06.405 --> 04:10.705
He sits with his little feet
on top of his little desk and lectured me.

04:10.876 --> 04:14.006
He happens to be one of the
best-qualified prosecutors in the state.

04:14.179 --> 04:16.769
Perhaps he beat you out
for that job fair and square.

...or "altitude"?

whole life go down the tubes like that.

10:10.747 --> 10:15.837
It's like the 17th century mathematician
and philosopher RenÃ© Descartes once said:

"You hoist your boss. you pay the price."

10:21.524 --> 10:24.054
-Here he is.
-Thank you. Bull. where did you find him?

14:02.603 --> 14:04.833

that I think Dan Fielding...

14:05.005 --> 14:08.735
...is ignorant. bull-headed
and just plain stupid.

14:09.543 --> 14:12.073
About that recommendation . . ..

14:12.646 --> 14:16.236
And I'm probably crazy for thinking this.
much less saying it out loud...

14:16.416 --> 14:22.786
...but I believe that underneath all this junk
there is something that is salvageable.

14:23.422 --> 14:25.412
Would you reconsider?

14:29.729 --> 14:33.499
I suppose. If he apologized.

all the way to brain damage.

15:01.792 --> 15:04.632
-You do?
-You've got your pride.

15:04.795 --> 15:06.725
You've been humiliated.

15:06.897 --> 15:11.227

who sits on booster seats in restaurants.

15:12.603 --> 15:14.093

15:14.271 --> 15:16.471

15:19.009 --> 15:22.709

Kids can be very creative
when they tease you. you know.

15:34.590 --> 15:37.650
You see. I stopped growing
when I was 11 years old.

15:39.595 --> 15:42.685
But. then. apparently. so did you.

15:45.168 --> 15:50.568
Look. I am sorry you were born that way.

15:50.740 --> 15:52.140
Hm.

15:52.308 --> 15:55.008
That's exactly what my father said...

15:55.878 --> 15:57.538
...just before he left.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.380
Your father left?

15:59.547 --> 16:01.947
I guess it was rough on him.

16:02.116 --> 16:07.416

his carried the water bucket.

16:07.588 --> 16:12.688
His friends' sons played football.
his carried the water bucket.

16:12.860 --> 16:16.630
To this day. I go crazy
every time I go by a drinking fountain.

16:19.099 --> 16:22.829
You mean your father walked out
just because you were...

16:24.237 --> 16:26.297
'--Petite?

16:29.109 --> 16:30.699
The night before he left...

16:30.876 --> 16:34.936
...I heard him tell my mother
that it was his fault.

16:35.848 --> 16:39.908
He said that I was
a punishment from God.

16:42.554 --> 16:45.724
But my mother was a intelligent
and caring woman.

16:45.891 --> 16:48.021
And she finally explained it to me...

16:48.193 --> 16:52.393
...that it wasn't my inadequacies
he couldn't deal with.

16:55.501 --> 16:57.471
It was his own.

17:07.179 --> 17:10.148
Is it true you can hang yourself
with your own belt?

17:10.314 --> 17:12.944
You can do it with your own words.

17:19.123 --> 17:23.723
Vincent. I am truly sorry
for everything that I said and did.

17:23.895 --> 17:27.845
You may shoot me
in the vital organ of your choice.

17:31.803 --> 17:34.033
AP0|ogy accepted.

17:34.205 --> 17:37.295
I'll get back to you on which organ.

17:39.877 --> 17:43.137
In the meantime. get those cases together
for the rest of the session.

17:45.450 --> 17:46.680
You're taking me back?

17:47.117 --> 17:50.947
Yes. Because I think
you're being sincere.

17:51.120 --> 17:55.020
Also. I've seen your conviction record.
You're good.

17:56.759 --> 17:59.389
But most of all. I'm taking you back...

17:59.562 --> 18:04.402
...because it will give me the opportunity
to make your life a living hell.

18:06.835 --> 18:09.065
You think you're a tough customer?

18:09.237 --> 18:11.427
Well. move over. buster.

18:11.606 --> 18:14.006
Because I'm the toughest.
I'm the meanest...

18:14.175 --> 18:18.435
...I'm the nastiest little man
God ever put on this earth.

18:18.613 --> 18:21.213
I'm going to make you run.
I'm going to make you jump...

18:21.381 --> 18:26.341
...I am going to make you
slither on the ground like a snake.

18:26.787 --> 18:29.777
God bless you. sir!

18:37.631 --> 18:40.901
-I don't understand him.
-Neither do I.

18:41.068 --> 18:45.368
But together we can have some fun
abusing him till we do.

18:49.176 --> 18:51.976
Dan apologized? Our Dan?

18:52.145 --> 18:54.405
Very same.
It was really kind of beautiful.

18:54.581 --> 18:56.211
He really listened.

18:56.383 --> 19:00.083
-So he's working?
-Well. I wouldn't exactly call it working.

19:00.253 --> 19:03.093
Yes. sir. I can pick up
your dry cleaning on the way home.

19:03.656 --> 19:06.626
It's more like groveling for dollars.

19:06.791 --> 19:09.521
And you typed up all the plea bargain
motions for December?

19:09.694 --> 19:11.354
-Yes. sir.
-The conviction ratios?

19:11.529 --> 19:14.159
Oh. yeah. stuck in my pants.

19:14.331 --> 19:16.921
Oh. Fine.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.120
Now. about my car....

19:19.601 --> 19:22.371
Light wash. no wax.
I can have it first thing tomorrow.

19:22.538 --> 19:25.908
Fine. Tomorrow. what?

19:26.341 --> 19:30.041
Tomorrow. my lord.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.566
Good. Now toss me a salad.

19:40.087 --> 19:41.647
Oh. and Fielding...

19:41.822 --> 19:44.122
...got any spare change
for the vending machine?

19:44.291 --> 19:47.161
I'm a little short right now.

19:49.529 --> 19:51.189
Did you hear me. Fielding?

19:51.363 --> 19:56.303
I said. I'm a little short right now.

19:58.938 --> 20:00.698
Anything you would care to say?

20:11.684 --> 20:13.584
A little nervous about your date. Bernie?

20:13.752 --> 20:17.752
No. I'm afraid for my life.

20:17.922 --> 20:22.422
Oh. come on. Bernie.
It's just sweet. little old Flo.

20:22.594 --> 20:26.124
She sent me a box of whips.

20:28.833 --> 20:30.893
That must be a joke.

20:31.069 --> 20:34.799
Oh. I see the party favors arrived.

20:35.573 --> 20:38.913
Florence. about dinner tonight.

20:39.077 --> 20:40.667
Oh. forget dinner.

20:40.844 --> 20:43.644
What the hell. let's just shack up.

20:44.348 --> 20:48.338
I can live off your savings
and devote myself to my hobbies.

20:48.517 --> 20:50.707
Did I ever mention the motorcycle club?

20:51.887 --> 20:54.047
Actually. it's more of a gang.

20:54.222 --> 20:56.692
Florence. we have to talk.

20:56.858 --> 20:58.488
Sure. what topic?

20:58.660 --> 21:02.060
Well. it's kind of private.

21:06.300 --> 21:09.290
That roast should be done by now.

21:12.940 --> 21:16.670
-Florence. it's not going to work.
-It's not?

21:16.844 --> 21:20.114
Don't get me wrong.
it's not that I don't find you attractive...

21:20.280 --> 21:22.410
...it's just. well...

21:22.583 --> 21:27.613
...I'm used to a certain pace
when it comes to relationships.

21:27.788 --> 21:28.848
Like?

21:29.023 --> 21:32.933
Like you're a Corvette
and I'm a milk truck.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.690
Oh.

21:35.896 --> 21:38.016
I'm sorry. really I am.

21:38.198 --> 21:42.468
Well. I guess if that's the way you feel.

21:42.636 --> 21:43.826
It is.

21:44.004 --> 21:46.344
And listen. who knows?

21:46.507 --> 21:48.437
In a few years...

21:48.609 --> 21:53.209
...after you'll have gotten all of this
out of your system....

21:55.014 --> 21:56.314
Goodbye. Florence.

21:58.016 --> 21:59.576
Goodbye. Bernie.

22:12.931 --> 22:15.831
Ee-vah!

22:16.868 --> 22:18.198
-He bought it?
-Bought it?

22:18.370 --> 22:20.930
That c|own's gotta be halfway
over the river by now.

22:21.106 --> 22:23.506
All right!

22:25.711 --> 22:28.841
-I sense a conspiracy.
-Yes. sir.

22:29.014 --> 22:33.084
See. I told Florence
what a nuisance Bernie was with Selma.

22:33.251 --> 22:36.521
I figured it was a matter of time
before he started bothering Florence.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.678
So we just decided
to beat him to the punch.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.327
Being irresistible must be tough. huh?

22:41.893 --> 22:43.193
We manage.

22:43.360 --> 22:44.950
You know. I still can't believe...

22:45.128 --> 22:47.858
...Bernie actually bought
all that stuff we concocted.

22:48.798 --> 22:52.428
The line about the motorcycle gang
was my favorite.

22:52.602 --> 22:54.262
Motorcycle gang?

22:55.404 --> 22:56.434
Ready. angel?

22:57.272 --> 23:00.212
FLORENCE: Oh. anytime. doll.
-We better get a move on.

23:00.375 --> 23:02.895
We gotta link up
with 50 guys from Sickle and Skull...

23:03.078 --> 23:08.038
...and still make the Jersey border before
the highway patrol throws up a barricade.

23:08.584 --> 23:10.314
Some of us were born to run.
