Lisa, we have

14:30.278 --> 14:32.595
We had a party
and didn't invite you.

14:33.598 --> 14:36.190
It was a week ago.
We watched a cool TikTok.

14:36.284 --> 14:38.042
But anyone
who watches the TikTok

14:38.211 --> 14:40.286
dies after seven days.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.622
I watched it first. (grunts)

14:42.716 --> 14:44.107
Oopsie!

14:44.200 --> 14:46.384
Finally, I'm not a twin anymore.

14:46.535 --> 14:49.536
I can have the top bunk and...
(yells)

14:49.631 --> 14:52.632
I killed Jerry and Larry.

14:52.784 --> 14:55.376
Bart, have you heard
about this deadly TikTok?

14:55.395 --> 14:58.471
Oh, yeah. Everyone was invited
to that party except you.

14:58.623 --> 15:01.457
-Even Milhouse?
-I was the bouncer.

15:01.476 --> 15:03.884
(laughing)

15:03.978 --> 15:06.796
Then I watched that
TikTok eight times.

15:06.889 --> 15:08.648
(groans)

15:08.742 --> 15:11.534
I didn't watch it.
But you can if you want.

15:13.396 --> 15:14.303
Nice try.

15:14.472 --> 15:16.748
If we knew
what was in that video,

15:16.899 --> 15:18.625
maybe we could stop it.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.812
We just have to find someone

15:22.830 --> 15:24.480
who isn't afraid of death

15:24.499 --> 15:26.332
and likes to watch TV.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.242
I'm your man.

15:28.261 --> 15:33.322
But, Grampa, if you do watch,
you die in seven days.

15:33.416 --> 15:35.582
That's three more

15:35.677 --> 15:37.418
(laughs)

15:37.512 --> 15:38.511
Okay.

15:38.663 --> 15:40.846
First,
there's an evil-looking ring.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.348
Then an empty chair.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.350
Then a lady combing her hair.

15:44.502 --> 15:47.837
I like the old movies
where the combing was implied.

15:47.930 --> 15:49.781
Now there's a bunch of maggots.

15:49.932 --> 15:50.949
Satan head.

15:51.025 --> 15:53.308
More maggots. More maggots.

15:53.436 --> 15:55.194
No, wait,
that's an ad for Chipotle.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.455
Now a woman's jumping
off a cliff,

15:57.606 --> 15:59.532
and we end up
with an abandoned well.

15:59.684 --> 16:01.793
This is the kind of movie
you watch in a museum

17:32.460 --> 17:34.535
Shouldn't you have
told the police first?

17:34.554 --> 17:36.128
I tried to tell Wiggum.
