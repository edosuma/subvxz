00:00.618 --> 00:02.050
<i>Previously on rescue me...</i>

00:02.085 --> 00:04.449
boo!

00:04.484 --> 00:05.767
Jesus Christ, stack.

00:05.802 --> 00:07.009
Hey, laurel and hardy.

00:07.044 --> 00:08.182
Hey, how's the family?

00:08.217 --> 00:09.518
Oh, they're fine, you know?

00:11.317 --> 00:12.350
73 is stuck in there.

00:12.385 --> 00:13.318
Probie went in after him.

00:13.353 --> 00:14.251
There was a huge collapse.

00:14.286 --> 00:15.435
This thing's blocked.

00:15.470 --> 00:16.549
Stack! I'm gonna get you

00:16.584 --> 00:18.351
Out of here. Stay with me, OK.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.284
You told me you were a

00:19.319 --> 00:20.116
One-Guy guy.

00:20.151 --> 00:21.216
I am. That's why I'm

00:21.251 --> 00:22.617
Screwing around with a woman.

00:22.652 --> 00:23.968
See, see, I knew it, man.

00:24.003 --> 00:25.910
You're such a jerk-Off, Mike.

00:25.945 --> 00:27.681
I'm confused. I miss pussy.

00:27.716 --> 00:29.216
We show up there. We totally

00:29.251 --> 00:30.682
Act like we're together.

00:30.717 --> 00:32.000
By 11 o'clock tonight, she can't

00:32.034 --> 00:33.126
Keep her hands off the phone.

00:33.161 --> 00:34.217
Johnny and Janet cursing our

00:34.252 --> 00:35.551
Souls to eternal hell.

00:35.586 --> 00:36.850
Maggie Gavin, will you

00:36.885 --> 00:38.282
Marry me?

00:38.317 --> 00:39.367
I already said yes, doofus.

00:39.402 --> 00:40.417
Come on, you're totally

00:40.452 --> 00:41.101
Serious?

00:41.136 --> 00:41.715
Yes.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.451
You're gonna marry me?

00:42.486 --> 00:43.149
Yes.

00:43.184 --> 00:44.615
Oh, that is awesome.

00:44.650 --> 00:46.017
Just so I'm clear. I marry

00:46.052 --> 00:47.384
Her, I get to have conjugal

00:47.419 --> 00:48.182
Visits?

00:48.217 --> 00:49.017
Once every 10 days for an

00:49.052 --> 00:50.015
Hour at a time.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.251
Perfect. You got any

00:51.286 --> 00:52.135
Breath spray?

00:52.170 --> 00:52.949
I'm Natalie.

00:52.984 --> 00:54.850
Hi, Natalie. I'm Franco.

00:54.885 --> 00:57.267
So, this shit you're trying

00:57.302 --> 00:59.650
To forget. What's her name?

00:59.685 --> 01:00.815
No, no. No, no, no.

01:00.850 --> 01:01.850
I think it's a little too soon

01:01.885 --> 01:03.201
For that much truth.

01:03.236 --> 01:04.483
I had an epiphany, Tom.

01:04.518 --> 01:06.584
I'm turning over a new leaf.

01:06.619 --> 01:07.483
A new leaf?

01:07.518 --> 01:09.050
Yeah, I got closure.

01:11.251 --> 01:12.249
Shit.

01:12.284 --> 01:13.082
That's got to be tough,

01:13.117 --> 01:14.667
Huh, Tommy? Knowing I'm banging

01:14.702 --> 01:16.217
Your ex. Knowing you're never

01:16.252 --> 01:17.484
Gonna get mine.

01:17.519 --> 01:19.068
Tommy...

01:19.103 --> 01:20.583
yeah...

01:20.618 --> 01:21.683
I always knew that you'd

01:21.718 --> 01:22.882
Be good at that.

01:22.917 --> 01:23.850
I think I'm... I think I'm

01:23.885 --> 01:24.551
Ready to go again.

01:24.586 --> 01:25.785
Oh...

01:25.820 --> 01:26.949
what?

01:26.984 --> 01:28.015
Hey, stud.

01:28.050 --> 01:29.717
Is that Janet?

01:29.752 --> 01:31.349
Is that angie?

01:31.384 --> 01:33.117
Well, the moment is complete.

01:33.152 --> 01:34.568
She's got a lot of stuff that

01:34.603 --> 01:35.927
She left here that she still

01:35.962 --> 01:37.723
Comes to pick up sometimes.

01:37.758 --> 01:39.484
She's probably... like maybe

01:39.519 --> 01:41.750
Pick up a dress?

01:44.050 --> 01:45.251
Got a long way to go. Is it

01:45.286 --> 01:46.382
Anywhere we know?

01:46.417 --> 01:47.467
Smells like food on the

01:47.502 --> 01:48.518
Stove to me, doesn't it?

01:48.553 --> 01:49.416
Yeah.

01:49.451 --> 01:51.449
FDNY. Hello.

01:51.484 --> 01:52.817
Fire department. Open up.

01:52.852 --> 01:54.351
FDNY, let's go!

01:54.386 --> 01:56.249
Pop it.

01:56.284 --> 01:59.782
All right. FDNY.

01:59.817 --> 02:03.184
Oh, my God. We got a customer

02:03.219 --> 02:05.201
Right in here.

02:05.236 --> 02:06.877
Holy shit.

02:06.912 --> 02:08.347
Jesus Christ.

02:08.382 --> 02:09.747
That's one guy?

02:09.782 --> 02:11.133
Yeah. You believe this?

02:11.168 --> 02:12.726
We got two thirds of

02:12.761 --> 02:14.284
The million man march

02:14.319 --> 02:15.615
Right here.

02:15.650 --> 02:16.567
Let's get him up and get

02:16.602 --> 02:17.484
Him back to the circus.

02:17.519 --> 02:18.583
Or the knicks.

02:18.618 --> 02:20.301
Same thing really. Ready?

02:20.336 --> 02:21.676
With your legs.

02:21.711 --> 02:22.982
Lift your knees.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.650
Oh, Jesus! God. It's like

02:24.685 --> 02:25.901
Trying to lift rhode island.

02:25.936 --> 02:27.117
Rhode island's not this

02:27.152 --> 02:28.049
Tall, pal.

02:28.084 --> 02:29.717
Guys, I got another broad

02:29.752 --> 02:30.483
Back there.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.801
OK. Hey, we got another

02:31.836 --> 02:33.177
Girl in the back. Grab her.

02:33.212 --> 02:34.518
OK. Holy shit, is that

02:34.553 --> 02:35.385
Dennis rodman?

02:35.420 --> 02:36.182
Go get the girl.

02:36.217 --> 02:39.949
All right.

02:39.984 --> 02:40.750
Michael, give us a hand,

02:40.785 --> 02:41.549
Will you?

02:41.584 --> 02:43.484
Holy shit. Kareem abdul

02:43.519 --> 02:44.483
Jabbar.

02:44.518 --> 02:45.815
He looks really young.

02:45.850 --> 02:47.133
That's such a positive issue

02:47.168 --> 02:48.417
With black people. They always

02:48.452 --> 02:49.501
Look a lot younger than

02:49.536 --> 02:51.426
They are, you know?

02:51.461 --> 02:53.282
Let me try.

02:53.317 --> 02:54.149
Jesus, look at the size of

02:54.184 --> 02:55.484
That guy. No wonder it took you

02:55.519 --> 02:56.882
So long to get him out.

02:56.917 --> 02:57.983
Yeah, we were thinking about

02:58.018 --> 02:59.484
Cutting him up and bringing him

02:59.519 --> 03:00.701
Down in pieces or something.

03:00.736 --> 03:01.884
That would have meant an extra

03:01.919 --> 03:03.317
Trip down to get a saw.

03:05.717 --> 03:06.715
You OK?

03:06.750 --> 03:07.700
I've got dry mouth.

03:07.735 --> 03:08.650
Yeah, man. My mouth is

03:08.685 --> 03:09.982
Dry, too.

03:10.017 --> 03:11.518
I'm starving. Are you hungry?

03:11.553 --> 03:12.683
I could eat.

03:12.718 --> 03:14.417
Pizza.

03:14.452 --> 03:16.082
Yeah.

03:16.117 --> 03:17.033
And chips.

03:17.068 --> 03:17.915
And dip.

03:17.950 --> 03:19.717
Dip. Yeah, man. Dip.

03:22.184 --> 03:23.567
Hey, Chief, are you there?

03:23.602 --> 03:25.659
Yeah, Garrity. Go ahead.

03:25.694 --> 03:27.238
Uh, listen, Chief. Mikey

03:27.273 --> 03:28.783
And I, we got into this back

03:28.818 --> 03:29.817
Room here.

03:29.852 --> 03:30.782
Yeah?

03:30.817 --> 03:31.648
Looks like a goddamn

03:31.683 --> 03:33.284
Greenhouse. Chief, it's amazing.

03:33.319 --> 03:34.735
There's like beds with dirt

03:34.770 --> 03:36.027
And plants and all kinds of

03:36.062 --> 03:37.284
Sunlamps. I think that must be

03:37.319 --> 03:38.349
What caused the fire.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.684
Are we talking about what I

03:39.719 --> 03:41.535
Think we're talking about?

03:41.570 --> 03:43.316
Uh, yeah...

03:43.351 --> 03:44.251
I don't know, Chief. What are

03:44.286 --> 03:44.982
We talking about?

03:45.017 --> 03:46.416
Pot, marijuana, weed.

03:46.451 --> 03:48.167
Yes, yes. That's definitely

03:48.202 --> 03:49.726
What we're talking about.

03:49.761 --> 03:51.216
This guy is growing, like,

03:51.251 --> 03:52.834
Hundreds of plants. At least he

03:52.869 --> 03:55.026
Used to be. They've all gone up

03:55.061 --> 03:57.172
In smoke now. Smells like the

03:57.207 --> 03:59.284
Inside of a bong in here.

03:59.319 --> 04:00.748
Bonggg...

04:00.783 --> 04:01.816
that's such a funny word.

04:01.851 --> 04:02.850
Garrity, get your ass out

04:02.885 --> 04:03.884
Here on the double.

04:03.919 --> 04:04.884
Hey, uh, Chief?

04:04.919 --> 04:06.015
What?

04:06.050 --> 04:07.550
Should I, uh, should I

04:07.585 --> 04:09.015
Bring mikey with me?

04:09.050 --> 04:10.750
Yes, goddammit, yes.

04:10.785 --> 04:11.884
Hey, come on.

04:14.284 --> 04:16.349
Bong.

04:16.384 --> 04:18.634
Bonggg...

04:18.668 --> 04:20.849
bong!

04:20.884 --> 04:21.783
Goons. I'm surrounded by

04:21.817 --> 04:23.516
Goons.

04:23.551 --> 04:24.549
Hey, boys, do me a favor.

04:24.584 --> 04:25.784
Keep an eye on my friend here.

04:25.819 --> 04:27.185
I got to notify the cops. This

04:27.220 --> 04:28.551
Is now officially a crime scene.

04:28.586 --> 04:29.718
Dude.

04:29.753 --> 04:30.815
Dude?

04:30.850 --> 04:31.850
Yeah, there's nothing

04:31.885 --> 04:32.850
In there. Just growing

04:32.885 --> 04:34.082
Flowers in there.

04:34.117 --> 04:35.451
What kind of flowers?

04:35.486 --> 04:37.285
Geraniums.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.084
Geraniums.

04:40.417 --> 04:41.750
Settle down, boys, will you?

04:41.785 --> 04:43.084
Get me some cd73s out of

04:43.119 --> 04:44.116
My rig.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.267
Hey, we got any Bob marley?

04:45.302 --> 04:46.384
I'm ready for some reggae,

04:46.419 --> 04:47.216
Chief.

04:47.251 --> 04:48.317
Cd73s, they're exposure

04:48.352 --> 04:49.349
Forms. You guys have been

04:49.384 --> 04:50.467
Exposed to a foreign substance

04:50.502 --> 04:51.551
During the course of operations

04:51.586 --> 04:52.782
Which means we have to

04:52.817 --> 04:54.050
Report it. Which means we have

04:54.085 --> 04:55.351
To wait around and fill the

04:55.386 --> 04:56.618
Forms out. You guys are not

04:56.653 --> 04:58.168
Paying attention to me anyway.

04:58.203 --> 04:59.683
So, I think what he's saying

04:59.718 --> 05:00.950
Is there's no cds, man.

05:00.985 --> 05:01.934
No music.

05:01.969 --> 05:02.849
Wow.

05:02.884 --> 05:04.618
Screw the cds, I want pizza.

05:04.653 --> 05:05.915
Yeah, man.

05:05.950 --> 05:07.067
All right, guys. All that

05:07.102 --> 05:08.184
Stuff I said about God over

05:08.219 --> 05:08.968
The years.

05:09.003 --> 05:09.682
Yeah.

05:09.717 --> 05:11.084
I take most of it back.

05:11.119 --> 05:13.251
Why? Oh...

05:13.286 --> 05:15.349
yeah.

05:15.384 --> 05:16.382
Hey, brother.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.783
God's pizza. We deliver.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.351
I'd do her.

05:19.386 --> 05:20.849
You would?

05:20.884 --> 05:22.084
Oh, yeah, in a heartbeat.

05:22.119 --> 05:23.149
That's interesting.

05:23.184 --> 05:25.017
Wait a minute. Who are we

05:25.052 --> 05:26.015
Talking about here?

05:26.050 --> 05:27.815
Heather mills mccartney.

05:27.850 --> 05:29.850
Ex-Wife of former beatle Paul.

05:29.885 --> 05:31.384
Yeah. I'd hit that.

05:31.419 --> 05:32.149
Really?

05:32.184 --> 05:33.082
Oh, yeah, man.

05:33.117 --> 05:34.017
Even though she only has

05:34.052 --> 05:34.782
The one leg.

05:34.817 --> 05:35.750
Tommy, it's a bonus.

05:35.785 --> 05:36.551
How is it a bonus?

05:36.586 --> 05:37.585
It gives you an extra

05:37.620 --> 05:39.252
Sexual position to enjoy,

05:39.287 --> 05:40.719
For one. That being, her

05:40.754 --> 05:42.369
Laying on her side, OK, the

05:42.404 --> 05:44.060
Side with the leg, you straddle

05:44.095 --> 05:45.356
Said leg, and do her sideways

05:45.391 --> 05:46.754
Without worrying about the

05:46.789 --> 05:48.117
Extra pesky leg getting in

05:48.152 --> 05:48.849
The way.

05:48.884 --> 05:49.815
What about the stub?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.750
I didn't think about that.

05:51.785 --> 05:52.417
Yeah.

05:52.452 --> 05:53.015
Pass.

05:53.050 --> 05:53.850
How you doing with those

05:53.885 --> 05:54.715
Forms, boys?

05:54.750 --> 05:56.084
Still working on it, Chief.

05:56.119 --> 05:57.015
Here you go.

05:57.050 --> 05:58.717
Since when are you kenneth

05:58.752 --> 05:59.984
Mills mccartney?

06:00.019 --> 06:01.217
Did I write that?

06:01.252 --> 06:02.282
Come on.

06:02.317 --> 06:04.117
Hey, probie. Wake up.

06:04.152 --> 06:05.382
Anymore pizza?

06:05.417 --> 06:06.867
Your social security number,

06:06.902 --> 06:08.317
Mike. You're missing a few

06:08.352 --> 06:09.282
Digits.

06:09.317 --> 06:10.417
Oh, what did I put down?

06:10.452 --> 06:11.516
6.

06:11.551 --> 06:12.516
6 digits?

06:12.551 --> 06:14.516
No. Just the number 6.

06:14.551 --> 06:16.184
Come on. Work on it. Come on.

06:19.717 --> 06:20.650
Look.

06:23.217 --> 06:23.882
What's up, Garrity?

06:23.917 --> 06:25.849
Guess what? What if the

06:25.884 --> 06:26.751
Government is, like, secretly

06:26.786 --> 06:27.951
Recording everything that we

06:27.986 --> 06:29.085
Do and say with secret devices

06:29.120 --> 06:30.068
That are planted, like, right

06:30.103 --> 06:31.076
Out in the open, right under

06:31.111 --> 06:32.097
Our noses? This parking meter

06:32.132 --> 06:33.274
Right here? I was walking by,

06:33.309 --> 06:34.196
And it started blinking. And

06:34.231 --> 06:35.224
Then it started making this,

06:35.259 --> 06:36.305
Like, camera shutter clicking

06:36.340 --> 06:37.351
Sound. I think it took my

06:37.386 --> 06:38.116
Picture.

06:38.151 --> 06:39.017
Was it your good side?

06:39.052 --> 06:39.884
It was straight on.

06:39.919 --> 06:40.682
Oh.

06:40.717 --> 06:41.567
I was squinting though.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.417
You better get back and

06:42.452 --> 06:42.915
Do it again.

06:42.950 --> 06:43.817
You're right. I'm gonna

06:43.852 --> 06:44.516
Go back.

06:44.551 --> 06:45.518
Hey, fix your hair, dude.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:00.351 --> 07:02.000
* on another day,

07:02.035 --> 07:03.615
Come on, come on,

07:03.650 --> 07:05.151
With these ropes I tied,

07:05.186 --> 07:06.917
Can we do no wrong?

07:06.952 --> 07:08.382
Now we grieve

07:08.417 --> 07:10.017
'Cause now is gone,

07:10.052 --> 07:11.651
Things were good

07:11.686 --> 07:13.216
When we were young,

07:13.251 --> 07:14.717
With my teeth locked down

07:14.752 --> 07:16.351
I can see the blood

07:16.386 --> 07:17.915
Of a thousand men

07:17.950 --> 07:19.917
Who have come and gone,

07:19.952 --> 07:21.282
Now we grieve

07:21.317 --> 07:22.917
'Cause now is gone,

07:22.952 --> 07:24.534
Things were good

07:24.569 --> 07:26.109
When we were young,

07:26.144 --> 07:27.764
Is it safe to say?

07:27.799 --> 07:29.349
Come on, come on,

07:29.384 --> 07:31.017
Was it right to leave?

07:31.052 --> 07:32.668
Come on, come on,

07:32.703 --> 07:34.293
Will I ever learn?

07:34.328 --> 07:35.906
Come on, come on,

07:35.941 --> 07:37.646
Come on, come on,

07:37.681 --> 07:39.351
Come on, come on *

07:57.151 --> 07:58.518
Jesus. You scared me.

07:58.553 --> 08:00.285
How you doing?

08:00.320 --> 08:01.982
Not so good.

08:02.017 --> 08:04.667
I go to the bathroom twice an

08:04.702 --> 08:07.209
Hour and cry my eyes out.

08:07.244 --> 08:09.717
Just, I don't want John to

08:09.752 --> 08:11.349
Hear me.

08:11.384 --> 08:12.884
I thought they were just

08:12.919 --> 08:14.316
Taking one leg.

08:14.351 --> 08:17.518
Oh, no, no. That's, uh...

08:17.553 --> 08:19.583
that was yesterday.

08:19.618 --> 08:20.417
They took the other one this

08:20.452 --> 08:23.549
Morning.

08:23.584 --> 08:24.451
What am I gonna tell him when

08:24.486 --> 08:26.849
He wakes up?

08:26.884 --> 08:28.917
I just... hope he doesn't

08:28.952 --> 08:31.382
Blame me.

08:31.417 --> 08:32.783
No, no, no. He won't

08:32.818 --> 08:35.381
Blame you.

08:35.417 --> 08:36.783
Look at him. He's half

08:36.818 --> 08:38.049
A man.

08:48.417 --> 08:49.982
Sorry.

08:50.017 --> 08:51.451
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

08:51.486 --> 08:54.151
It's OK.

08:57.117 --> 08:59.351
You go home. Hang out with

08:59.386 --> 09:01.351
The kids, OK?

09:01.386 --> 09:03.282
Are you sure?

09:03.317 --> 09:05.017
Yeah. I'll stay with him.

09:05.052 --> 09:05.882
Yeah?

09:05.917 --> 09:06.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:06.835 --> 09:07.683
OK. Thank you.

09:07.718 --> 09:08.717
OK.

09:42.050 --> 09:43.082
What are you doing?

09:43.117 --> 09:44.433
Just getting some of my

09:44.468 --> 09:45.750
Clothes. Some of my stuff.

09:45.785 --> 09:47.082
Moving out?

09:47.117 --> 09:48.284
Yeah, I guess so.

09:48.319 --> 09:49.615
I think so.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.033
So, were you gonna tell me,

09:51.068 --> 09:52.192
Or were you just gonna sneak

09:52.227 --> 09:53.317
Off in the middle of the night

09:53.352 --> 09:54.718
Like a goddamn pussy?

09:54.753 --> 09:56.049
It's morning, dude.

09:56.084 --> 09:57.167
You know what I mean, man.

09:57.202 --> 09:58.442
Look, I don't want to make

09:58.477 --> 09:59.648
A big thing out of this,

09:59.683 --> 10:02.133
You know? You're a great guy,

10:02.168 --> 10:03.843
But it was just a mistake.

10:03.878 --> 10:05.314
Don't call it that, Mike.

10:05.349 --> 10:06.715
It's not right for me.

10:06.750 --> 10:07.983
You know, I thought, maybe I'd

10:08.018 --> 10:09.617
Get a little more comfortable

10:09.652 --> 10:11.234
With the idea, but now I know

10:11.269 --> 10:13.143
That that's never gonna happen.

10:13.178 --> 10:14.764
Oh, oh. So all those times

10:14.799 --> 10:16.158
I was going down on you, you

10:16.193 --> 10:17.372
Were uncomfortable. Well, you

10:17.407 --> 10:18.429
Seemed pretty comfortable to

10:18.464 --> 10:19.457
Me, Mike. I mean, if you didn't

10:19.492 --> 10:20.421
Like what was happening, why

10:20.456 --> 10:21.351
The hell didn't you just

10:21.386 --> 10:22.483
Speak up, man?

10:22.518 --> 10:24.316
You know how it is when

10:24.351 --> 10:25.967
Someone's going down on you.

10:26.002 --> 10:27.584
You don't want to be rude.

10:28.850 --> 10:30.351
Well, I catch you here again,

10:30.386 --> 10:31.484
I'm gonna kick your ass.

10:31.519 --> 10:32.516
Now get out.

10:32.551 --> 10:33.384
What about the rest of

10:33.419 --> 10:34.182
My stuff?

10:34.217 --> 10:35.000
You got 2 minutes. Anything

10:35.035 --> 10:36.226
You leave behind is going in

10:36.261 --> 10:37.417
The garbage. I'd start moving

10:37.452 --> 10:38.484
If I were you.

10:45.850 --> 10:47.251
Good morning.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.034
Somebody needs to smile.

10:51.069 --> 10:52.551
Yeah, give me a couple

10:52.586 --> 10:54.182
Of days.

10:54.217 --> 10:55.182
Where'd Jeannie go?

10:55.217 --> 10:57.167
Nurse took her outside for

10:57.202 --> 10:58.543
Some fresh air. You know, I

10:58.578 --> 10:59.897
Thought I was gonna have to

10:59.932 --> 11:01.508
Move her out of here. With

11:01.543 --> 11:02.730
This place costing so much.

11:02.765 --> 11:04.357
She nearly fell apart when I

11:04.392 --> 11:05.871
Mentioned that possibility.

11:05.906 --> 11:07.128
So for the last month or so,

11:07.163 --> 11:08.490
I've been out there busting my

11:08.525 --> 11:09.817
Ass trying to earn a little

11:09.852 --> 11:11.050
Extra scratch.

11:12.518 --> 11:15.367
Now, I tell her she can stay.

11:15.402 --> 11:18.426
Everything's all right, and...

11:18.461 --> 11:21.451
she completely falls apart.

11:21.486 --> 11:23.615
A real meltdown.

11:23.650 --> 11:26.267
She doesn't even know who I am.

11:26.302 --> 11:28.159
Mr. Reilly, you might want

11:28.194 --> 11:30.017
To get a little alzheimer's

11:30.052 --> 11:31.601
Of your own.

11:31.636 --> 11:33.116
Excuse me?

11:33.151 --> 11:35.050
Despite this little episode,

11:35.085 --> 11:36.950
Jeannie's happy here. Now you

11:36.985 --> 11:38.401
Have to be happy, too.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.043
If the visits disturb you,

11:40.078 --> 11:41.281
Stop remembering to come.

11:41.316 --> 11:42.484
You telling me forget about

11:42.519 --> 11:43.648
My wife?

11:43.683 --> 11:45.151
She's forgotten about you.

11:45.186 --> 11:46.316
Because she's sick.

11:46.351 --> 11:47.251
Does it matter what the

11:47.286 --> 11:48.349
Reason is?

11:48.384 --> 11:49.116
Who the hell do you think

11:49.151 --> 11:50.850
You are talking to me like that?

11:50.885 --> 11:54.750
Karleen simpson. Nice to

11:54.785 --> 11:55.915
Meet you.

11:55.950 --> 11:57.416
Get the hell out.

11:57.451 --> 11:59.167
I'm sorry if I upset you,

11:59.202 --> 12:00.884
Really. I was only trying

12:00.919 --> 12:02.151
To help.

12:06.317 --> 12:07.934
Don't let the disease claim

12:07.969 --> 12:09.160
Both of you, Mr. Reilly.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.351
That's what I was trying

12:10.386 --> 12:11.750
To say.

12:18.351 --> 12:19.517
Hey. I thought I smelled

12:19.552 --> 12:20.683
Something. What you making,

12:20.718 --> 12:21.682
Baby?

12:21.717 --> 12:23.116
Huevos rancheros.

12:23.151 --> 12:24.984
Oh, looks like scrambled

12:25.019 --> 12:26.015
Eggs to me.

12:26.050 --> 12:27.117
Well, you didn't have any

12:27.152 --> 12:28.451
Tomatoes, onions, chiles, or

12:28.486 --> 12:29.968
Cheese, so that's what it is.

12:30.003 --> 12:31.451
You want to grab me some juice?

12:31.486 --> 12:34.216
Yeah.

12:34.251 --> 12:38.750
Oh, snap. Look at this.

12:38.785 --> 12:39.815
Surprise.

12:39.850 --> 12:41.116
Wow, baby, I don't know who

12:41.151 --> 12:42.783
This guy is, but he is stunning.

12:42.818 --> 12:44.717
Work that camera, biotch.

12:44.752 --> 12:45.915
You like?

12:45.950 --> 12:47.382
Yeah, yeah. It's nice.

12:47.417 --> 12:49.550
You are an excellent subject.

12:49.585 --> 12:52.251
You have depth. Stuff working

12:52.286 --> 12:54.201
Beneath the surface. Secrets.

12:54.236 --> 12:56.117
No. No, no, no. No secrets

12:56.152 --> 12:57.516
Here, babe.

12:57.551 --> 12:58.634
So the little girl's room

12:58.669 --> 12:59.717
Down the hall. That's not

12:59.752 --> 13:00.817
A secret?

13:02.984 --> 13:04.316
Apparently not.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.783
You want to tell me?

13:07.317 --> 13:11.750
I had a daughter. She's not

13:11.785 --> 13:13.084
Here anymore.

13:13.119 --> 13:14.349
She died?

13:14.384 --> 13:15.549
Don't worry. She's fine.

13:15.584 --> 13:16.800
Very much alive. Living a life

13:16.835 --> 13:17.982
Only about a thousand times

13:18.017 --> 13:19.650
Better than I can ever give her.

13:19.685 --> 13:21.017
You want to explain?

13:21.052 --> 13:22.648
Another time.

13:22.683 --> 13:24.666
What about you though, huh?

13:24.701 --> 13:26.650
Any secrets you want to share?

13:26.685 --> 13:28.750
I'm an open book.

13:28.785 --> 13:29.849
You think?

13:29.884 --> 13:31.517
How come you're always coming

13:31.552 --> 13:32.768
Over here? I mean, I mentioned

13:32.803 --> 13:33.860
Going to your place a couple

13:33.895 --> 13:34.882
Of times, you always manage

13:34.917 --> 13:36.584
To sidestep it. What's the deal?

13:36.619 --> 13:38.251
Maybe my place is a pig sty.

13:38.286 --> 13:40.168
No. I don't think so.

13:40.203 --> 13:42.050
So, anything you want to

13:42.085 --> 13:43.748
Tell me?

13:43.783 --> 13:45.084
OK. There is one thing.

13:46.917 --> 13:47.915
You're late for work.

13:47.950 --> 13:49.617
Have some eggs. I'm gonna grab

13:49.652 --> 13:51.284
My stuff and walk out with you.

13:51.319 --> 13:52.801
Uh-Huh.

13:52.836 --> 13:53.926
Both legs?

13:53.961 --> 13:54.982
Yeah.

13:55.017 --> 13:55.715
How's he doing?

13:55.750 --> 13:56.717
He's so doped up, he doesn't

13:56.752 --> 13:57.817
Even know, you know?

13:57.852 --> 13:58.685
How about deb,

13:58.720 --> 13:59.483
She holding up?

13:59.518 --> 14:00.451
I think she's afraid he's

14:00.486 --> 14:01.384
Gonna blame her when he comes

14:01.419 --> 14:03.484
Out of it. What's wrong

14:03.519 --> 14:04.516
With you?

14:04.551 --> 14:05.884
Rough morning.

14:05.919 --> 14:07.583
Oh.

14:07.618 --> 14:09.151
Hey, thanks for noticing,

14:09.186 --> 14:10.251
Buddy.

14:13.484 --> 14:14.717
All right.

14:17.284 --> 14:18.950
OK. OK.

14:22.551 --> 14:23.667
What the hell was that?

14:23.702 --> 14:24.783
Probably a holdover from

14:24.818 --> 14:25.782
The weed.

14:25.817 --> 14:26.967
Hey, bro. What's going on?

14:27.002 --> 14:28.117
How you doing, brother?

14:28.152 --> 14:28.982
Do me a favor.

14:29.017 --> 14:30.117
Stop touching me, OK?

14:30.152 --> 14:31.217
Mike just touched you.

14:31.252 --> 14:32.049
I saw him.

14:32.084 --> 14:32.915
Mike got a special...

14:32.950 --> 14:34.100
you know how the pope gives

14:34.135 --> 14:35.159
Out special dispensations

14:35.194 --> 14:36.184
Sometimes? That's what Mike

14:36.219 --> 14:37.282
Got, OK?

14:37.317 --> 14:38.017
All right. Well, I mean,

14:38.052 --> 14:38.851
You're gonna have to start

14:38.886 --> 14:39.752
Getting used to the fact that

14:39.787 --> 14:40.618
In real life, we're gonna be

14:40.653 --> 14:41.949
Bros, bro, so...

14:41.984 --> 14:42.783
you're not married to my

14:42.818 --> 14:43.648
Sister yet.

14:43.683 --> 14:44.782
But it's happening soon,

14:44.817 --> 14:45.850
You know, and even if I try to

14:45.885 --> 14:47.118
Not call you bro, I'm still

14:47.153 --> 14:48.351
Gonna be giving you bro energy

14:48.386 --> 14:49.149
Loud and clear.

14:49.184 --> 14:50.249
Stop calling me bro.

14:50.284 --> 14:51.217
You call me bro anymore, I'm

14:51.252 --> 14:52.151
Gonna punch you in the face.

14:52.186 --> 14:52.882
Very hard.

14:52.917 --> 14:53.783
See, that kind of talk, used

14:53.818 --> 14:54.615
To make me think that you

14:54.650 --> 14:55.750
Hated me, but now I know, it's

14:55.785 --> 14:57.118
Sibling rivalry.

14:57.153 --> 14:58.202
Get your hands...

14:58.237 --> 14:59.251
yo, guys. Come check

14:59.286 --> 15:00.516
This out.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.351
What does he want?

15:02.386 --> 15:04.068
I don't know.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.715
Oh, yeah.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.217
You gotta be kidding me.

15:07.252 --> 15:08.784
Nice hog, Lou.

15:08.819 --> 15:10.282
Hey, thanks.

15:10.317 --> 15:11.500
That is some sweet machine.

15:11.535 --> 15:12.576
Jesus, you know what we got

15:12.611 --> 15:13.581
To do, we got to get a couple

15:13.616 --> 15:14.500
Of those bikes, you know what

15:14.535 --> 15:15.443
I mean? Start our own little

15:15.478 --> 15:16.351
Family gang. The gatlin family

15:16.386 --> 15:18.082
Ramblers.

15:18.117 --> 15:19.017
Go inside the house.

15:19.052 --> 15:19.715
Why, why?

15:19.750 --> 15:20.584
Go inside the house

15:20.619 --> 15:21.416
Right now.

15:21.451 --> 15:23.250
Family squabble. No biggie.

15:23.285 --> 15:25.050
So how do you guys like

15:25.085 --> 15:25.748
The ride?

15:25.783 --> 15:26.416
Nothing like a new set of

15:26.451 --> 15:27.917
Shiny wheels to turn a midlife

15:27.952 --> 15:29.082
Crisis around.

15:29.117 --> 15:30.334
At this point, jer, I'm not

15:30.369 --> 15:31.460
Interested in turning it

15:31.495 --> 15:32.806
Around, I'm interested in

15:32.841 --> 15:33.895
Outrunning the goddamn thing.

15:33.930 --> 15:34.823
Yo, Lou, let me take it for

15:34.858 --> 15:35.820
A spin around the block.

15:35.855 --> 15:36.748
I don't think so. You got

15:36.783 --> 15:38.050
A recruitment roster to report

15:38.085 --> 15:39.317
On inside. And then you got a

15:39.352 --> 15:40.351
Sink full of dishes.

15:40.386 --> 15:41.249
It's a mess.

15:41.284 --> 15:42.617
Nice. Make the puerto rican

15:42.652 --> 15:44.018
Guy wash the dishes. Thanks a

15:44.053 --> 15:45.202
Lot, Chief. Now you know why

15:45.237 --> 15:46.351
I'm taking that lieutenant's

15:46.386 --> 15:47.483
Exam. All right?

15:47.518 --> 15:48.817
Hey, don't crack your head

15:48.852 --> 15:50.117
On this thing. I need you

15:50.152 --> 15:50.984
Around here.

15:51.019 --> 15:52.084
Bikes.

15:54.117 --> 15:55.483
So, I guess this is what the

15:55.518 --> 15:56.850
Terminator looks like without

15:56.885 --> 15:58.282
The steroids, huh?

15:58.317 --> 15:59.767
Very funny, very funny.

15:59.802 --> 16:01.182
It's the new me. Yeah, I'm

16:01.217 --> 16:02.300
Getting the rest of my leathers

16:02.335 --> 16:03.809
Next week. I'm gonna find some

16:03.844 --> 16:05.647
Nice, chunky blonde girl with

16:05.682 --> 16:07.451
A tattoo right on her ass crack.

16:07.486 --> 16:08.715
Mm-Hmm.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.033
Then you know, after that,

16:10.068 --> 16:11.309
Probably be working security

16:11.344 --> 16:12.947
For the stones. You want me to

16:12.982 --> 16:14.551
Get you backstage, meet mick?

16:14.586 --> 16:15.684
OK, what's going on?

16:15.719 --> 16:16.748
Come on, Tom. A little

16:16.783 --> 16:18.050
Support. I'm trying... I'm trying

16:18.085 --> 16:18.815
New things.

16:18.850 --> 16:21.533
Uh-Huh. I don't get it.

16:21.568 --> 16:24.182
Look, for the first time

16:24.217 --> 16:25.950
In a long time, you know, I feel

16:25.985 --> 16:27.751
Like I have possibilities.

16:27.786 --> 16:29.185
I feel like I can maybe turn

16:29.220 --> 16:30.549
Things around. Maybe even,

16:30.584 --> 16:32.584
You know, God forbid, be happy.

16:32.619 --> 16:34.035
What's the point in getting

16:34.070 --> 16:35.451
There if you're gonna burn up

16:35.486 --> 16:36.683
In a fire, huh?

16:36.718 --> 16:37.682
Right.

16:37.717 --> 16:39.984
Look, I got this cousin

16:40.019 --> 16:41.084
Down in Florida.

16:41.119 --> 16:41.982
Yeah.

16:42.017 --> 16:43.667
He's got this fishing boat.

16:43.702 --> 16:45.076
Charter boat. Takes rich

16:45.111 --> 16:46.930
Tourists out for the day.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.424
Fishing, you know. Makes a

16:48.459 --> 16:49.849
Whole boatload of money.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.251
Got a first mate, the guy got

16:51.286 --> 16:52.835
Married, he's not coming back.

16:52.870 --> 16:54.384
He asked me if I was interested,

16:54.419 --> 16:56.234
I said, no. But now I'm

16:56.269 --> 16:57.959
Thinking, the guy's got a

16:57.994 --> 16:59.705
Guest house for me, you know.

16:59.740 --> 17:01.679
A beautiful boat. Fresh air,

17:01.714 --> 17:04.531
Sunshine. Now, I'm thinking yes.

17:04.567 --> 17:06.559
I mean, it's an interesting

17:06.594 --> 17:08.550
Plan. It's a beautiful boat,

17:08.586 --> 17:09.917
But, not for you.

17:09.953 --> 17:11.215
Well, why not?

17:11.251 --> 17:13.384
Well... Florida. First of all.

17:13.419 --> 17:15.518
I mean jeb Bush, Florida, OK?

17:15.553 --> 17:16.215
Yeah.

17:16.251 --> 17:17.050
That's number one. Number

17:17.085 --> 17:18.017
Two, have you heard about the

17:18.051 --> 17:19.050
Alligators. It's been all over

17:19.086 --> 17:20.018
Cnn the last couple of weeks,

17:20.053 --> 17:21.135
There have been alligators

17:21.170 --> 17:22.344
Climbing out of the swamps

17:22.378 --> 17:23.513
Down there, and eating joggers

17:23.549 --> 17:24.465
Right off the jogging path.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.392
There was, like, two women

17:25.426 --> 17:26.284
Jogging, and they got eaten by

17:26.319 --> 17:26.785
Alligators.

17:26.819 --> 17:27.215
I don't jog.

17:27.251 --> 17:27.949
When they're done eating

17:27.983 --> 17:29.617
The joggers, they're gonna come

17:29.652 --> 17:31.251
After the sedentary people, OK?

17:31.286 --> 17:32.501
And then, the bermuda triangle

17:32.536 --> 17:33.626
Which is right off the coast

17:33.661 --> 17:35.289
Of Florida. I mean, you could

17:35.324 --> 17:36.882
Just, disappear, OK? Not to

17:36.917 --> 17:38.750
Mention, cubans. I'm not talking

17:38.785 --> 17:39.882
Cigars, I'm talking actual

17:39.917 --> 17:42.518
Cubans. Wall to wall. All right?

17:42.553 --> 17:44.368
Florida's not for you.

17:44.403 --> 17:46.149
I don't know, you know?

17:46.184 --> 17:48.067
Maybe you didn't hear me ask

17:48.102 --> 17:49.950
About a little support before.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.017
Lou, I'm just saying.

18:00.151 --> 18:01.884
Ahh...

18:04.284 --> 18:05.116
yeah.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.534
Look who decides to pick up.

18:06.569 --> 18:08.343
Listen, man. Something's

18:08.378 --> 18:09.981
Come up, you know. Something

18:10.016 --> 18:11.833
That you got to know. Something

18:11.868 --> 18:13.292
That I don't want to tell you

18:13.327 --> 18:14.638
About over a telephone, so I was

18:14.673 --> 18:15.845
Kind of hoping you and me, you

18:15.880 --> 18:17.032
Know, we could get together.

18:17.067 --> 18:18.192
Have a little face to face.

18:18.227 --> 18:19.317
I could tell you in person.

18:21.817 --> 18:23.284
Tommy, are you there?

18:27.317 --> 18:28.600
Listen, Tommy, man. How long

18:28.635 --> 18:29.726
Are we gonna keep on doing this,

18:29.761 --> 18:30.755
You know? I mean, you and I,

18:30.790 --> 18:31.720
We go a lot of years ahead of

18:31.755 --> 18:32.869
Us, brother, and I just, what

18:32.904 --> 18:34.343
Do you say, we work together

18:34.378 --> 18:35.797
And just try to put this

18:35.832 --> 18:37.658
Bullshit behind us, man?

18:37.693 --> 18:39.484
You know? When can we get

18:39.519 --> 18:40.284
Together?

18:47.650 --> 18:48.316
Seanster.

18:48.351 --> 18:49.149
Hey, hey. What's up?

18:49.184 --> 18:49.917
Hey, man. You want to go

18:49.952 --> 18:50.782
Grab a drink?

18:50.817 --> 18:52.017
I can't, man. I got stuff to

18:52.052 --> 18:53.384
Take care of for the wedding

18:53.419 --> 18:54.717
With the lovely bride to be.

18:54.752 --> 18:55.417
You're still marrying

18:55.452 --> 18:56.485
Maggie, right?

18:56.520 --> 18:57.483
Of course, why?

18:57.518 --> 18:58.683
The "lovely" thing threw me

18:58.718 --> 18:59.949
Off.

18:59.984 --> 19:00.849
Hey, speaking of lovely,

19:00.884 --> 19:02.384
How's it going with Natalie? She

19:02.419 --> 19:03.715
Sounds great, dude.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.417
Yeah. She is. Possibly.

19:05.452 --> 19:07.084
Possibly, why is something

19:07.119 --> 19:07.849
Wrong?

19:07.884 --> 19:08.767
I don't know, man. I think

19:08.802 --> 19:09.710
She might have another guy on

19:09.745 --> 19:10.618
The hook. A guy she could be

19:10.653 --> 19:11.535
Living with.

19:11.570 --> 19:12.382
No shit.

19:12.417 --> 19:13.467
Yeah. She never wants to go

19:13.502 --> 19:14.809
Back to her place for some

19:14.844 --> 19:16.064
Reason. Plus every time we're

19:16.099 --> 19:17.374
Together, her phone rings like

19:17.409 --> 19:18.729
100 times an hour. I could swear

19:18.764 --> 19:20.050
It's the same person every time.

19:20.085 --> 19:21.084
Pretty sure it's a dude.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.149
Man, that sucks.

19:22.184 --> 19:23.349
Yeah. Tell me about it.

19:23.384 --> 19:24.434
Finally found a girl I can get

19:24.469 --> 19:25.484
Serious about, turns out she

19:25.519 --> 19:26.615
Could be playing me.

19:26.650 --> 19:27.700
Goddamn karma again, right?

19:27.735 --> 19:28.742
You got to confront her,

19:28.777 --> 19:29.750
You know, see if it's true.

19:29.785 --> 19:30.782
See what's going on.

19:30.817 --> 19:32.317
Yeah, I know. Love's a pain

19:32.352 --> 19:33.249
In the balls.

19:33.284 --> 19:34.284
Tell me about it.

19:41.217 --> 19:42.983
You know, what have I told

19:43.018 --> 19:44.701
You a million, zillion,

19:44.736 --> 19:46.384
Gajillion goddamn times.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.483
Uh, no.

19:48.518 --> 19:50.434
About the car, OK?

19:50.469 --> 19:52.316
Oh, I don't...

19:52.351 --> 19:53.817
what do we do every 3,000

19:53.852 --> 19:54.849
Miles?

19:54.884 --> 19:56.850
We check the oil.

19:56.885 --> 19:57.615
Oh, right.

19:57.650 --> 19:58.584
Check the oil, check the

19:58.619 --> 19:59.751
Oil, check the oil.

19:59.786 --> 20:00.849
OK, OK. Check the oil.

20:00.884 --> 20:01.950
I got it. Look, I'm very busy.

20:01.985 --> 20:03.017
I got lots of things. I got

20:03.052 --> 20:03.982
Lots of lists.

20:04.017 --> 20:05.550
OK, on one of the lists, put

20:05.585 --> 20:07.018
Check the oil, OK? Do you want

20:07.053 --> 20:08.218
Me to put one of them little

20:08.253 --> 20:09.318
Stickers in, you know when you

20:09.353 --> 20:10.384
Go to the shop, they put the

20:10.419 --> 20:11.668
Sticker in the window.

20:11.703 --> 20:12.882
No, bossy. I got it.

20:12.917 --> 20:13.949
I'm not being bossy. I'm

20:13.984 --> 20:15.618
Just trying to help you have a

20:15.653 --> 20:16.583
Safe vehicle.

20:16.618 --> 20:18.517
You are being very...

20:18.552 --> 20:20.167
stick up the assy.

20:20.202 --> 20:21.593
Stick up the what?

20:21.628 --> 20:22.984
Honey, what is wrong

20:23.019 --> 20:23.949
With you?

20:23.984 --> 20:25.251
Nothing's wrong with me.

20:25.286 --> 20:26.518
Come on, you're so, you're,

20:26.553 --> 20:27.985
Like, on edge.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.269
I'm not on edge.

20:29.304 --> 20:30.483
Tommy, Tommy.

20:30.518 --> 20:31.551
Don't, don't, don't start

20:31.586 --> 20:32.717
With the tommys.

20:32.752 --> 20:34.518
Tommy...

20:36.783 --> 20:37.817
OK. I think the crew may be

20:37.852 --> 20:38.650
Breaking up.

20:38.685 --> 20:39.551
What?

20:39.586 --> 20:40.382
Yeah.

20:40.417 --> 20:41.316
Frank's taking the

20:41.351 --> 20:42.284
Lieutenant's test, and probie's

20:42.319 --> 20:43.017
Put...

20:44.683 --> 20:46.483
come here.

20:46.518 --> 20:47.182
Probie's been thinking of

20:47.217 --> 20:48.367
Putting in for a transfer, and

20:48.402 --> 20:49.518
I think even Lou's thinking of

20:49.553 --> 20:50.418
Leaving.

20:50.453 --> 20:51.368
No way.

20:51.403 --> 20:52.260
Yeah.

20:52.295 --> 20:53.122
Sheila.

20:53.157 --> 20:53.915
Oh, hi.

20:53.950 --> 20:55.249
Hi. How you doing?

20:55.284 --> 20:56.451
I'm good. How are you?

20:56.486 --> 20:57.251
Good to see you.

20:57.286 --> 20:57.982
Good to see you.

20:58.017 --> 20:59.050
Garrity, your mom's on the

20:59.085 --> 20:59.748
Phone.

20:59.783 --> 21:00.783
All right. I'll see you

21:00.818 --> 21:01.668
Later.

21:01.703 --> 21:02.483
Bye.

21:02.518 --> 21:03.317
See you, bro.

21:03.352 --> 21:04.317
Yeah.

21:05.484 --> 21:06.317
Bro?

21:09.683 --> 21:11.216
What else? What do you mean?

21:11.251 --> 21:12.650
You work with a bunch of

21:12.685 --> 21:13.951
Guys, you laugh your ass off

21:13.986 --> 21:15.351
When you're together, and you

21:15.386 --> 21:16.901
Know, blah blah blah, things

21:16.936 --> 21:19.026
Click. And then, you know, I'm

21:19.061 --> 21:20.889
Expected to work with a bunch

21:20.924 --> 21:22.387
Of college age kids who decide

21:22.422 --> 21:23.669
They want to be heroes after

21:23.704 --> 21:24.760
9/11, you know what I mean?

21:24.795 --> 21:25.722
I don't want to get my ass

21:25.757 --> 21:26.670
Melted off working with these

21:26.705 --> 21:27.661
Guys who don't know what the

21:27.696 --> 21:28.906
Hell they're doing. Losing Lou

21:28.941 --> 21:30.117
Would be bad enough, but losing

21:30.152 --> 21:31.484
Franco, I mean, come on.

21:31.519 --> 21:32.885
OK. What about Sean?

21:32.920 --> 21:33.985
Sean's marrying Maggie.

21:34.020 --> 21:35.050
He's gonna be dead in 31/2

21:35.085 --> 21:36.216
Months tops anyways.

21:36.251 --> 21:37.584
If I lose Lou and Franco, I

21:37.619 --> 21:38.917
Don't think I can do this job

21:38.952 --> 21:39.817
Anymore.

21:48.650 --> 21:49.715
Let me help you.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.367
I can do that. I can make a

21:51.402 --> 21:52.984
Better life for the both of us.

21:53.019 --> 21:55.015
OK, we can go anywhere. We

21:55.050 --> 21:57.416
Could, um, we could buy a place

21:57.451 --> 21:59.284
On the beach, and we can spend

21:59.319 --> 22:00.735
The rest of our lives for the

22:00.770 --> 22:02.093
Next 30 years watching the kids

22:02.128 --> 22:03.739
Grow up and getting married

22:03.774 --> 22:05.312
And their grandkids play in

22:05.347 --> 22:08.265
The ocean, and in the sand.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.375
I am so rich. I have all that

22:10.410 --> 22:13.014
Widow money just sitting in the

22:13.049 --> 22:15.033
Bank untouched. The only thing

22:15.068 --> 22:16.676
I've done since Jimmy went is

22:16.711 --> 22:18.014
Change houses a couple times,

22:18.049 --> 22:19.383
And I made a pretty penny on

22:19.418 --> 22:21.134
The profit, thank you very much.

22:21.169 --> 22:22.993
All I have to do is call the

22:23.028 --> 22:26.422
Bank, and the next day, I would

22:26.457 --> 22:28.553
Have a check for $3.1 million.

22:28.588 --> 22:30.650
How do you have that much

22:30.685 --> 22:31.583
Money?

22:31.618 --> 22:33.783
Interest, Tommy. I mean, it's

22:33.818 --> 22:36.015
Been 5 years.

22:36.050 --> 22:38.117
Shit, it has been 5 years.

22:38.152 --> 22:39.151
Jesus Christ.

22:42.551 --> 22:43.750
What's the matter?

22:46.351 --> 22:47.184
You know Johnny stackhouse.

22:47.219 --> 22:48.082
Of course I do.

22:48.117 --> 22:49.551
You hear about what happened?

22:49.586 --> 22:50.648
Yes.

22:50.683 --> 22:51.984
They took his legs.

22:52.019 --> 22:53.549
Oh, God.

22:53.584 --> 22:54.349
We went to probie school

22:54.384 --> 22:56.533
Together. Me, him, and Jimmy.

22:56.568 --> 22:59.326
Makes you think, you know?

22:59.361 --> 23:01.356
Honey, look at me. I won't

23:01.391 --> 23:03.154
Let anything happen to you.

23:03.189 --> 23:04.636
Look at me. I would never let

23:04.671 --> 23:06.027
Anything happen to you. Just

23:06.062 --> 23:07.384
Tell me to call the bank. I will

23:07.419 --> 23:08.750
Call the bank.

23:08.785 --> 23:09.615
Shh.

23:09.650 --> 23:10.351
Hey, Sheila.

23:10.386 --> 23:10.982
Hi.

23:11.017 --> 23:11.715
How you doing?

23:11.750 --> 23:13.817
Damn, girl, you look fantastic.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.118
How you been, huh?

23:15.153 --> 23:16.349
Good to see you.

23:16.384 --> 23:17.384
It's good to see you, too.

23:17.419 --> 23:18.451
You smell good, too.

23:18.486 --> 23:19.149
I do?

23:19.184 --> 23:20.084
Nice perfume. Yeah.

23:20.119 --> 23:21.117
Yeah, see you.

23:24.451 --> 23:25.567
Oh, that's it, baby.

23:25.602 --> 23:27.026
Oh, yeah, ride the pony.

23:27.061 --> 23:28.416
Ride the baloney pony.

23:28.451 --> 23:30.150
Theodore, is this is as good

23:30.185 --> 23:31.834
As you thought it was gonna be?

23:31.869 --> 23:33.243
Don't talk. I want you to put

23:33.278 --> 23:34.714
All your focus and all your

23:34.749 --> 23:35.966
Energy into the sex. That's

23:36.001 --> 23:37.292
Your goal for the next 40

23:37.327 --> 23:38.584
Minutes. If it isn't sex,

23:38.619 --> 23:39.618
Don't do it.

23:40.518 --> 23:41.717
Goddamn it, get off. I got

23:41.752 --> 23:42.849
To answer the phone.

23:42.884 --> 23:45.434
Goddamn guards calling every

23:45.469 --> 23:47.460
10 minutes. How in the hell do

23:47.495 --> 23:49.451
They expect us to get into a

23:49.486 --> 23:50.349
Rhythm?

23:50.384 --> 23:51.867
They need to know that you're

23:51.902 --> 23:53.351
Still here, and I'm not dead.

23:53.386 --> 23:54.516
What am I gonna do?

23:54.551 --> 23:55.917
Strangle you with your own

23:55.952 --> 23:57.182
Panties?

23:57.217 --> 23:58.884
Oh, you want to try that?

24:01.217 --> 24:02.251
Yeah.

24:04.518 --> 24:06.316
Hello. Oh, hello, mo.

24:06.351 --> 24:08.184
Yeah, I'm still here. And she's

24:08.219 --> 24:09.817
Still alive.

24:09.852 --> 24:11.815
Hi.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.715
Listen, I knew the deal

24:13.750 --> 24:15.517
Coming in, but this is goddamn

24:15.552 --> 24:17.249
Disruptive. Trying to get a

24:17.284 --> 24:18.750
Little pussy here. It's not like

24:18.785 --> 24:20.317
I'm gonna climb up inside there

24:20.352 --> 24:21.718
And have her smuggle me out.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.084
Jesus, Mike, you try and

24:23.119 --> 24:24.682
Flush a dictionary?

24:24.717 --> 24:25.634
Will you keep it down in

24:25.669 --> 24:26.709
There. I'm trying to have a

24:26.744 --> 24:27.713
Private conversation here.

24:27.748 --> 24:28.882
It's like the battle of

24:28.917 --> 24:29.983
The bulge in there.

24:30.018 --> 24:31.015
Bobby, give me five,

24:31.050 --> 24:32.084
Will you? I got something going

24:32.119 --> 24:33.316
Here, all right?

24:33.351 --> 24:34.251
I gotta go out ot the truck

24:34.286 --> 24:35.151
And pick up the heavy artillery

24:35.186 --> 24:35.949
Anyway.

24:35.984 --> 24:37.648
Don't go too far, OK?

24:37.683 --> 24:40.017
I got something wicked brewing

24:40.052 --> 24:41.516
Here.

24:41.551 --> 24:42.584
OK, see, here's the thing

24:42.619 --> 24:45.516
Is, sir. I, uh...

24:45.551 --> 24:48.051
see, my family, they really

24:48.086 --> 24:50.451
Raised me right. I think.

24:50.486 --> 24:52.782
And I wanted to do this

24:52.817 --> 24:54.783
Respectfully and officially.

24:54.818 --> 24:57.334
So that's why I'm here,

24:57.369 --> 24:59.493
Mr. Gavin. To ask you most

24:59.528 --> 25:03.105
Sincerely, and most...

25:03.140 --> 25:06.062
some other word, for your

25:06.097 --> 25:08.984
Daughter Maggie's hand in

25:09.019 --> 25:10.084
Marriage.

25:12.317 --> 25:14.915
Are you retarded?

25:14.950 --> 25:15.750
I can't believe Tommy's

25:15.785 --> 25:16.949
Missing it.

25:16.984 --> 25:18.717
I'm taking notes.

25:18.752 --> 25:19.483
OK.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.451
I just, I mean, I had some

25:20.486 --> 25:21.518
Reading comprehension issues

25:21.553 --> 25:22.751
In school. I had to take the

25:22.786 --> 25:23.950
Sats, like, 11 times, and I

25:23.985 --> 25:25.116
Still didn't pass.

25:25.151 --> 25:26.400
What's the point in asking

25:26.435 --> 25:27.676
Me for her hand in marriage

25:27.711 --> 25:28.917
When you've already asked her

25:28.952 --> 25:29.882
For it?

25:29.917 --> 25:31.767
That's a good point. That's

25:31.802 --> 25:33.143
A good point, dad. Is it OK

25:33.178 --> 25:34.398
If I call you that? It's not

25:34.433 --> 25:35.618
Too early to call you that.

25:35.653 --> 25:36.915
I don't know.

25:36.950 --> 25:38.950
Is it too early for me to call

25:38.985 --> 25:40.648
You asshole?

25:40.683 --> 25:43.050
... to call you

25:43.085 --> 25:44.451
Asshole.

25:47.317 --> 25:50.250
You do realize that she is

25:50.285 --> 25:53.184
A bloodsucking hell bitch.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.082
What?

25:54.117 --> 25:54.917
This is a private

25:54.952 --> 25:55.682
Conversation.

25:55.717 --> 25:56.416
You see these shoes, these

25:56.451 --> 25:57.484
Are gonna go right up your ass,

25:57.519 --> 25:58.349
Old man.

25:58.384 --> 25:59.717
You see how she talks to me?

25:59.752 --> 26:01.034
And I'm her father. Imagine

26:01.069 --> 26:02.176
What she'll say to you.

26:02.211 --> 26:03.284
I don't have to imagine.

26:03.319 --> 26:04.216
She really, she...

26:04.251 --> 26:06.284
you know, you seem like

26:06.319 --> 26:08.735
A nice kid. A little slow,

26:08.770 --> 26:11.151
But nice. You see that door

26:11.186 --> 26:11.968
Over there?

26:12.003 --> 26:12.715
Mm-Hmm.

26:12.750 --> 26:14.733
Use it. And never look back.

26:14.768 --> 26:16.682
You know what, that's it,

26:16.717 --> 26:18.017
You're out. You're not invited

26:18.052 --> 26:19.317
To the wedding. No invitation

26:19.352 --> 26:20.216
For you.

26:20.251 --> 26:21.251
What about the wedding after

26:21.286 --> 26:22.251
This one? Am I banned from

26:22.286 --> 26:23.216
That, too?

26:23.251 --> 26:23.982
OK, please. Will you guys

26:24.017 --> 26:25.450
Just please not fight, really.

26:25.485 --> 26:27.117
As a member, future member of

26:27.152 --> 26:28.750
The family. Please don't fight.

26:28.785 --> 26:31.051
OK, listen, sir. Marrying

26:31.086 --> 26:32.968
Maggie, it's the biggest and

26:33.003 --> 26:34.577
The scariest decision I've ever

26:34.612 --> 26:36.151
Made in my life, but it's also,

26:36.186 --> 26:37.149
It's the smartest and the

26:37.184 --> 26:39.517
Surest, and I just, I love her,

26:39.552 --> 26:41.651
You know? I love her fire and

26:41.686 --> 26:43.618
Her passion. And I even love

26:43.653 --> 26:45.551
Her anger. So it, really, it's

26:45.586 --> 26:46.882
Important to me, to us,

26:46.917 --> 26:48.783
Mr. Gavin, if we could have...

26:48.818 --> 26:50.917
your blessing.

26:55.683 --> 26:57.416
Oh... oh, hell.

26:57.451 --> 27:00.950
Welcome to the family...

27:00.985 --> 27:02.451
retard.

27:02.486 --> 27:03.882
That's...

27:03.917 --> 27:06.284
that's so great.

27:11.050 --> 27:13.217
Goddammit!

27:13.252 --> 27:15.349
Sheesh!

27:15.384 --> 27:18.084
And they wonder why we kill.

27:18.119 --> 27:18.815
Hello?

27:18.850 --> 27:19.849
Hey, girl. It's me.

27:19.884 --> 27:21.715
You must be psychic. I've

27:21.750 --> 27:23.184
Been thinking about you all day.

27:23.219 --> 27:24.282
Yeah, I've been thinking

27:24.317 --> 27:25.817
About you, too. Where you at?

27:25.852 --> 27:27.349
I'm at home.

27:27.384 --> 27:29.783
Really? Hey, uh, how about

27:29.818 --> 27:30.551
I come over there.

27:30.586 --> 27:34.249
Uh...

27:34.284 --> 27:35.217
how about I meet you out

27:35.252 --> 27:36.151
Somewhere, or we go back to

27:36.186 --> 27:36.618
Your place?

27:38.950 --> 27:39.583
Franco?

27:39.618 --> 27:40.683
Nat, what's going on, huh?

27:40.718 --> 27:41.715
What do you mean?

27:41.750 --> 27:42.800
I think you got something

27:42.835 --> 27:43.776
Going on over there, OK?

27:43.811 --> 27:44.682
Something you don't want me

27:44.717 --> 27:45.650
Knowing about. Now are you gonna

27:45.685 --> 27:47.301
Come clean or what?

27:47.336 --> 27:48.960
It's complicated.

27:48.995 --> 27:50.549
Is it a guy?

27:50.584 --> 27:54.683
Yeah. But it isn't what

27:54.718 --> 27:55.583
You think.

27:55.618 --> 27:56.951
Yeah, well, then why don't

27:56.986 --> 27:58.284
You explain it to me then, OK?

28:07.284 --> 28:08.451
Let it ring.

28:13.534 --> 28:15.834
Mr. Reilly. Hello.

28:15.869 --> 28:18.099
What do you want?

28:18.134 --> 28:19.468
I came to apologize for

28:19.503 --> 28:21.533
The other day.

28:21.568 --> 28:22.501
You're lucky I didn't talk

28:22.536 --> 28:23.935
To your supervisor.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.299
The shit you said.

28:25.334 --> 28:26.732
You have to understand,

28:26.767 --> 28:29.900
I see the pain. So much of it.

28:29.935 --> 28:32.184
The afflicted, they are free

28:32.219 --> 28:34.399
From it as far as we know.

28:34.434 --> 28:37.134
But the families, the loved ones

28:37.169 --> 28:39.834
Left behind. If you don't want

28:39.869 --> 28:41.899
To let go, I understand.

28:41.934 --> 28:44.550
But your Jeannie, just because

28:44.585 --> 28:46.843
She living in another world,

28:46.878 --> 28:49.101
That doesn't mean you have to

28:49.136 --> 28:52.068
Stop living in this one.

28:52.103 --> 28:53.968
I wish you the best.

28:54.003 --> 28:55.834
What did you say your

28:55.869 --> 28:57.900
Name was? Karla?

28:57.935 --> 28:58.932
Karleen.

28:58.967 --> 29:01.333
Thanks, karleen.

29:01.368 --> 29:03.665
Thanks a lot.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.216
My heart's a lot lighter now.

29:06.251 --> 29:08.733
I'll see you soon. I hope.

29:14.234 --> 29:15.633
So, dude, she gets all quiet.

29:15.668 --> 29:17.034
Big moment of drama.

29:17.069 --> 29:17.868
Oh, boy.

29:17.903 --> 29:18.632
Yeah.

29:18.667 --> 29:19.600
Hey, Chief. Good morning.

29:19.635 --> 29:20.765
Good morning, boys.

29:20.800 --> 29:21.967
What's up, Chief. Anyway,

29:22.002 --> 29:23.134
She cops to it, man. She is

29:23.169 --> 29:24.132
Living with a dude.

29:24.167 --> 29:25.383
Holy shit. You were right.

29:25.418 --> 29:26.692
Well, almost. It's her

29:26.727 --> 29:28.014
Brother. He's, like, uh,

29:28.049 --> 29:29.175
A little slow. So she looks

29:29.210 --> 29:30.288
After him. I'm going over there

29:30.323 --> 29:31.367
Tonight, I'm gonna meet him.

29:31.402 --> 29:32.199
Crisis averted.

29:32.234 --> 29:34.034
Oh, jeez. Good work, brother.

29:34.069 --> 29:34.900
Nice to hear.

29:34.935 --> 29:35.932
Yeah.

29:35.967 --> 29:36.783
Hey, how's it going?

29:36.818 --> 29:37.600
Hey, how are you, can I

29:37.635 --> 29:38.266
Help you?

29:38.301 --> 29:39.733
Uh, yeah, Mike Siletti works

29:39.768 --> 29:40.533
Here, right?

29:40.568 --> 29:41.598
Uh, yeah. He's upstairs.

29:41.633 --> 29:42.633
No, that's OK. I just wanted

29:42.668 --> 29:44.251
To drop this off. He left it

29:44.286 --> 29:45.560
At my place. I'm Chris. He's

29:45.595 --> 29:46.834
Probably never mentioned me.

29:46.869 --> 29:48.101
No, I don't think so.

29:48.136 --> 29:49.299
Well, I'm not surprised.

29:49.334 --> 29:50.717
Anyway, I didn't know if this

29:50.752 --> 29:52.101
Was important. It looks kind of

29:52.136 --> 29:53.334
Official.

29:55.967 --> 29:57.300
This is a transfer.

29:57.335 --> 29:58.598
What is this, a joke?

29:58.633 --> 30:00.083
I don't think so. That is

30:00.118 --> 30:01.293
Mike's signature right there.

30:01.328 --> 30:02.414
Jesus Christ. You work day

30:02.449 --> 30:03.558
In and day out with a guy,

30:03.593 --> 30:04.632
You think you know him.

30:04.667 --> 30:06.700
Well, I'm sure there are some

30:06.735 --> 30:07.568
Other things about Mike

30:07.603 --> 30:08.632
You don't know.

30:08.667 --> 30:09.266
Oh, yeah, like what?

30:09.301 --> 30:10.199
Well, let's just say, he's

30:10.234 --> 30:11.717
<i>A big fan of sex in the city.</i>

30:11.752 --> 30:13.059
Oh, me, too. It's a great

30:13.094 --> 30:14.247
Show. You know what I never

30:14.282 --> 30:15.291
Understood? Why we never got

30:15.326 --> 30:16.280
To see Sarah Jessica parker's

30:16.315 --> 30:17.374
Tits. You know, I mean cynthia

30:17.409 --> 30:18.488
Nixon, sure. Kim cattrell,

30:18.523 --> 30:19.568
Why not? Never Sarah Jessica

30:19.603 --> 30:20.199
Parker's.

30:20.234 --> 30:21.650
All right, let's just put it

30:21.685 --> 30:23.067
This way. He's playing for the

30:23.102 --> 30:24.301
Other team, dude.

30:24.336 --> 30:27.067
No way.

30:30.767 --> 30:31.732
What's up, dude?

30:31.767 --> 30:32.600
What's up, dude, that's all

30:32.635 --> 30:33.534
You got to say to me?

30:33.569 --> 30:34.332
Pretty much.

30:34.367 --> 30:35.232
OK, for your information,

30:35.267 --> 30:36.583
Chris was just here. All right,

30:36.618 --> 30:37.900
I know everything. I know what's

30:37.935 --> 30:38.632
Going on.

30:38.667 --> 30:39.967
Chris was here?

30:40.002 --> 30:41.434
That's right.

30:41.469 --> 30:42.832
Oh, shit.

30:42.867 --> 30:43.632
Yeah, I mean, we're such

30:43.667 --> 30:44.867
Good friends. Huh, Mike, when

30:44.902 --> 30:45.600
Were you gonna tell me

30:45.635 --> 30:46.267
About this?

30:46.302 --> 30:46.984
Never.

30:47.019 --> 30:47.632
Asshole.

30:47.667 --> 30:48.399
I was confused.

30:48.434 --> 30:49.334
Yeah, OK, well, now I'm

30:49.369 --> 30:50.184
Confused, too, all right?

30:50.219 --> 30:50.965
Why didn't you talk to me

30:51.000 --> 30:52.101
About it? Maybe I would've gone

30:52.136 --> 30:53.201
The same way.

30:53.236 --> 30:54.232
Get out of here.

30:54.267 --> 30:55.834
Yeah, bro. I like to keep it

30:55.869 --> 30:57.535
Fresh. I like to try new things.

30:57.570 --> 30:58.918
Switch hit. Different positions.

30:58.953 --> 31:00.267
How can you go around behind

31:00.302 --> 31:01.234
Our backs and do this?

31:01.269 --> 31:02.401
Sean, you gotta know the

31:02.436 --> 31:03.534
Truth. It was just Chris.

31:03.569 --> 31:04.734
Oh, don't pin this on him.

31:04.769 --> 31:05.818
But it was him. I mean, we're

31:05.853 --> 31:06.977
Talking maybe a half a dozen

31:07.012 --> 31:08.056
Blow jobs. It was always him

31:08.091 --> 31:09.101
Blowing me, I never kissed him

31:09.136 --> 31:10.099
Or slept in the same bed

31:10.134 --> 31:11.234
With him. It was just the blow

31:11.269 --> 31:12.468
Jobs, I swear.

31:17.000 --> 31:17.900
OK, what are we talking

31:17.935 --> 31:19.132
About here?

31:19.167 --> 31:20.134
I'm talking about what Chris

31:20.169 --> 31:20.799
Told you.

31:20.834 --> 31:21.499
Yeah, all Chris told me

31:21.534 --> 31:23.201
About was this transfer order.

31:23.236 --> 31:24.965
Holy shit!

31:25.000 --> 31:26.700
Sean, please, just don't tell

31:26.735 --> 31:28.032
Anybody.

31:28.067 --> 31:29.817
Ba ba ba boom .

31:29.852 --> 31:31.533
Mike's gay.

31:31.568 --> 31:32.650
Oh, hell. I know that.

31:32.685 --> 31:33.733
You talked to Chris, too?

31:33.768 --> 31:34.732
Who's Chris?

31:34.767 --> 31:38.000
Chris is his lover man,

31:38.035 --> 31:39.266
Uh, guy.

31:39.301 --> 31:40.301
I can explain, Lou. Please,

31:40.336 --> 31:41.134
Just don't let anybody

31:41.169 --> 31:41.901
Else know.

31:41.936 --> 31:42.668
Know what?

31:42.703 --> 31:43.366
Mike's gay.

31:43.401 --> 31:44.134
Yeah. Tell me something

31:44.169 --> 31:45.134
I don't know.

31:48.167 --> 31:50.267
Oh, you mean, gay gay.

31:55.234 --> 31:56.132
You know, the place I used

31:56.167 --> 31:57.334
To live, they were putting this

31:57.369 --> 31:59.468
New building up across the

31:59.503 --> 32:01.485
Street, and every morning on

32:01.520 --> 32:03.433
My way to work, I'd pass by

32:03.468 --> 32:05.501
The construction guys out there.

32:05.536 --> 32:08.134
And there was this one guy,

32:08.169 --> 32:10.701
Chris, and I noticed him a

32:10.736 --> 32:13.268
Couple of times, and one day,

32:13.303 --> 32:15.800
I was passing by, he sort of,

32:15.835 --> 32:17.665
Like, smiled at me.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.050
OK, I think I'm gonna puke.

32:19.085 --> 32:20.366
It freaked me out, too.

32:20.401 --> 32:22.667
You know, every morning, he'd,

32:22.702 --> 32:24.834
Like, give me this, like, smile.

32:24.869 --> 32:26.967
And one day, when I stepped out,

32:27.002 --> 32:28.598
He wasn't there.

32:28.633 --> 32:30.401
Did you check the end of

32:30.436 --> 32:31.299
Your cock?

32:31.334 --> 32:34.033
Lou. Let him talk.

32:34.068 --> 32:36.698
Go ahead, kid.

32:36.733 --> 32:38.900
He was gone, and I sort of,

32:38.935 --> 32:41.201
Like...

32:41.236 --> 32:43.433
missed him.

32:43.468 --> 32:45.384
All right. My balls just

32:45.419 --> 32:47.266
Went up behind my lungs.

32:47.301 --> 32:48.517
I don't know how to describe

32:48.552 --> 32:49.733
The way I was feeling, you know?

32:49.768 --> 32:52.618
He was a nice guy. And we

32:52.653 --> 32:54.793
Started talking, and, um,

32:54.828 --> 32:56.698
You know, I guess, I was,

32:56.733 --> 32:58.750
Like, lonely or something.

32:58.785 --> 33:00.576
So I moved into his place,

33:00.611 --> 33:03.189
And it was great at first,

33:03.224 --> 33:05.212
And... then it got weird.

33:05.247 --> 33:07.166
Oh. Then it got weird.

33:07.201 --> 33:08.201
'Cause I was wondering when

33:08.236 --> 33:10.018
That was gonna kick in.

33:10.053 --> 33:11.765
He was into me in...

33:11.800 --> 33:15.234
that way. That's when the blow

33:15.269 --> 33:16.698
Jobs started.

33:16.733 --> 33:19.866
And it freaked me out at first,

33:19.901 --> 33:22.250
Guys. I knew it wasn't right

33:22.285 --> 33:24.559
For me, you know? L-L-I...

33:24.594 --> 33:26.581
he's gone, I'm not with him.

33:26.616 --> 33:28.568
It's over, I left, and that's

33:28.603 --> 33:29.865
The whole story.

33:29.900 --> 33:30.834
Bullshit, Mike, what about

33:30.869 --> 33:31.899
The transfer?

33:31.934 --> 33:33.067
I filled the form out, but I

33:33.102 --> 33:34.499
Didn't turn it in.

33:34.534 --> 33:35.499
Cut the shit, Mike. You

33:35.534 --> 33:36.334
Already got your new house all

33:36.369 --> 33:37.199
Picked out.

33:37.234 --> 33:37.899
How do you know that?

33:37.934 --> 33:38.733
Because, he's playing for

33:38.768 --> 33:39.667
Their softball team.

33:39.702 --> 33:40.518
What?

33:40.553 --> 33:41.299
Yeah.

33:41.334 --> 33:42.084
Your boyfriend, Chris, he

33:42.119 --> 33:42.834
Told me that you were batting

33:42.869 --> 33:43.733
For the other team.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.399
What?

33:47.434 --> 33:49.583
OK, ignoring that, we have

33:49.618 --> 33:51.226
A serious issue here. It's a

33:51.261 --> 33:52.847
Matter of what everyone is

33:52.882 --> 33:54.241
Comfortable with. Given the

33:54.276 --> 33:55.738
Close quarters we share on a

33:55.773 --> 33:57.201
Daily basis, I don't know where

33:57.236 --> 33:58.051
The hell to even start.

33:58.086 --> 33:58.893
Yeah, I'll tell you where

33:58.928 --> 33:59.731
To start, Chief. I don't want

33:59.766 --> 34:00.866
Him showering with us, that's

34:00.901 --> 34:01.850
For sure. Nothing personal,

34:01.885 --> 34:02.876
Mikey, I just don't need you

34:02.911 --> 34:03.867
Staring at my hangdown like it's

34:03.902 --> 34:05.067
The ala carte special at

34:05.102 --> 34:06.199
Chez homo.

34:06.234 --> 34:06.983
You know what, and another

34:07.018 --> 34:07.859
Thing, I don't want to know

34:07.894 --> 34:08.830
About your new boyfriends, or

34:08.864 --> 34:09.899
Your new clothes, or nights out

34:09.934 --> 34:11.217
At the disco, or liza minnelli

34:11.252 --> 34:12.501
Or ass toys. Off limits from

34:12.536 --> 34:13.533
Now on.

34:13.568 --> 34:15.568
I'm not gay. I didn't do

34:15.603 --> 34:17.902
Anything sexual to him, you

34:17.937 --> 34:20.952
Know? I'm totally into chicks.

34:20.987 --> 34:23.159
Totally. And... I'm... seeing

34:23.195 --> 34:25.333
This girl for the past couple

34:25.369 --> 34:26.232
Of weeks.

34:26.266 --> 34:28.632
Yeah. A girl named dave.

34:28.668 --> 34:30.601
You know what? If this is

34:30.636 --> 34:32.201
The way it's gonna be, if I

34:32.235 --> 34:33.701
Can't make a little mistake in

34:33.735 --> 34:35.167
My personal life, then maybe

34:35.202 --> 34:36.601
I should transfer!

34:36.636 --> 34:37.965
Hey, hey, kid. Wait.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.733
Wait, wait, wait. Come here.

34:40.768 --> 34:43.366
Come here.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.632
Listen, guys. Better or worse,

34:45.668 --> 34:47.232
I think we all consider

34:47.266 --> 34:48.699
Ourselves kind of a family here.

34:48.735 --> 34:49.466
Correct?

34:49.501 --> 34:50.433
Yeah, right?

34:50.467 --> 34:51.433
All right?

34:51.467 --> 34:53.333
Now whether Mike's a fag...

34:53.369 --> 34:55.701
sorry, Mike. Or not, he's a

34:55.735 --> 34:57.818
Part of that family. Correct?

34:57.853 --> 34:59.900
I think as a firefighter, he's,

34:59.935 --> 35:01.834
You know, been starting to

35:01.869 --> 35:03.518
Pull his own weight. You know?

35:03.553 --> 35:04.827
You know, and maybe he acts

35:04.862 --> 35:06.066
A little faggy from time to

35:06.101 --> 35:07.934
Time. Sorry, Mike. But you know,

35:07.969 --> 35:09.484
In the shit, he's been learning,

35:09.519 --> 35:10.860
He's been performing. I mean,

35:10.895 --> 35:12.201
Johnny stack would not be alive

35:12.236 --> 35:14.318
Today without mikey here.

35:14.353 --> 35:16.343
Right? As far as it goes here

35:16.378 --> 35:18.005
In the house, I trust the kid.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.770
You know? I feel like if I'm,

35:19.805 --> 35:21.653
You know, if I'm stuck somewhere

35:21.688 --> 35:23.561
In the job, that he's got my,

35:23.596 --> 35:25.532
Uh, you know, he's got me

35:25.567 --> 35:27.468
Covered. Come here, kid.

35:27.503 --> 35:29.232
Come here.

35:29.267 --> 35:30.667
Thanks, Tommy.

35:30.702 --> 35:32.032
I love you, man.

35:32.067 --> 35:33.533
I got no problem with this.

35:33.568 --> 35:35.000
10 bucks says mikey's hard.

35:35.035 --> 35:36.167
I heard that.

35:36.202 --> 35:36.999
I'm in.

35:37.034 --> 35:38.401
I'll take a piece of that.

35:45.901 --> 35:48.000
Hey. So how you doing?

35:48.035 --> 35:50.065
Good. Come on in.

35:50.100 --> 35:54.132
Yeah. Wow. Incredible.

35:54.167 --> 35:54.934
I'm finally getting to look

35:54.969 --> 35:55.832
At the place.

35:55.867 --> 35:57.083
Starting to think you lived

35:57.118 --> 35:58.659
In a cardboard box somewhere.

35:58.694 --> 36:00.014
Richard, come say hi. He

36:00.049 --> 36:01.334
Loves meeting new people.

36:01.369 --> 36:02.632
Great.

36:02.667 --> 36:04.267
This is my big brother rich.

36:04.302 --> 36:06.200
Rich, this is Franco.

36:06.235 --> 36:08.299
How's it going?

36:08.334 --> 36:10.299
Oh, uh, great, man.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.667
How you doing? I mean, other

36:11.702 --> 36:13.701
Than the obvious stuff.

36:13.736 --> 36:15.065
Sorry.

36:15.100 --> 36:17.250
If you want to run, do it

36:17.285 --> 36:19.109
Now and get it over with.

36:19.144 --> 36:20.934
No, sweetheart. Not me.

36:20.969 --> 36:21.966
I'm sticking.

36:22.001 --> 36:23.767
Play checkers with me.

36:23.802 --> 36:25.499
Checkers? Yeah, sure.

36:25.534 --> 36:27.766
I thought the three of us

36:27.801 --> 36:29.901
Could go out and get something

36:29.936 --> 36:31.502
To eat. I'll just go wash up.

36:31.537 --> 36:33.068
You guys play a game, and I'll

36:33.103 --> 36:34.468
Change and come back.

36:34.503 --> 36:35.799
Don't take long.

36:35.834 --> 36:36.968
You'll be fine. Let him

36:37.003 --> 36:38.068
Win, rich.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.800
Sit down.

36:44.835 --> 36:47.065
Oh, yeah.

36:47.100 --> 36:48.500
What's your name again?

36:48.535 --> 36:50.766
Oh, I'm Franco.

36:50.801 --> 36:54.267
Franco. I go first.

36:54.302 --> 36:55.801
Sure.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.232
Now you go.

37:03.267 --> 37:06.098
All right, um...

37:06.133 --> 37:07.550
you know, I really, I don't

37:07.585 --> 37:08.968
Know this game that well.

37:09.003 --> 37:10.934
I'll move for you.

37:10.969 --> 37:12.300
OK.

37:18.100 --> 37:22.634
Thanks, rich.

37:26.334 --> 37:29.098
You suck.

37:29.133 --> 37:30.183
Yeah. Well, uh... I don't

37:30.218 --> 37:31.198
Think the learning curve's

37:31.233 --> 37:32.716
That steep. I'll figure it out.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.442
Uh, dude, I really don't think

37:34.477 --> 37:36.133
You should be... plastic's not

37:36.168 --> 37:37.934
For eating, man. Nat!

37:37.969 --> 37:39.933
Don't tell her.

37:39.968 --> 37:44.334
I will kick your goddamn ass.

37:48.133 --> 37:49.383
No problem.

37:49.418 --> 37:51.509
Your move.

37:51.544 --> 37:53.566
All right.

37:53.601 --> 37:55.334
What have you got there?

37:55.369 --> 37:56.668
Just a little motivation.

37:56.703 --> 37:58.118
I don't know if he can get

37:58.153 --> 37:59.527
Through this, Tom. God knows

37:59.562 --> 38:00.901
If anybody can, it's him.

38:05.001 --> 38:07.451
We picked this place out.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.901
To retire to. Bought it last

38:09.936 --> 38:10.933
Fall. I've been buying

38:10.968 --> 38:15.501
Furniture and patio furniture,

38:15.536 --> 38:20.034
And pillows. Lots of pillows.

38:20.069 --> 38:22.232
God, he hates pillows.

38:22.267 --> 38:24.968
Anyways, he kept, he kept saying

38:25.003 --> 38:26.868
He was gonna put in for his

38:26.903 --> 38:28.368
Pension, you know? Not that he

38:28.403 --> 38:30.218
Was serious. I think he was

38:30.253 --> 38:31.999
Just yessing me to death.

38:32.034 --> 38:35.450
He lived for the job. But now,

38:35.485 --> 38:38.193
If he goes, what do I get?

38:38.228 --> 38:41.431
At least the widows from 9/11,

38:41.466 --> 38:44.116
Not that you can put a price

38:44.151 --> 38:46.309
On any one life, I know that,

38:46.344 --> 38:50.572
But at least they have some

38:50.607 --> 38:54.801
Money to carry on. Me, I got

38:54.836 --> 38:56.732
Nothing.

38:56.767 --> 39:02.001
Half a husband. And a house.

39:02.036 --> 39:05.165
Full of pillows.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.250
I don't know, maybe if he wakes

39:06.285 --> 39:07.859
Up and sees this, maybe it will

39:07.894 --> 39:09.431
Give him some strength. Maybe

39:09.466 --> 39:10.968
We'll both end up there somehow.

39:27.534 --> 39:30.034
That wasn't so bad. You're

39:30.069 --> 39:31.065
Really good with him.

39:31.100 --> 39:31.983
Yeah, well, you know, I've

39:32.018 --> 39:32.909
Had a lot of practice. Couple

39:32.944 --> 39:33.766
Guys in my house are only a

39:33.801 --> 39:34.934
Notch or two above your brother,

39:34.969 --> 39:36.001
If that.

39:37.434 --> 39:38.934
Man, how did I get so lucky?

39:38.969 --> 39:40.399
I don't know. I was just

39:40.434 --> 39:41.634
Thinking the same thing myself.

39:41.669 --> 39:42.966
Nigger.

39:43.001 --> 39:44.132
Did he just...

39:44.167 --> 39:45.884
Richard, watch your language.

39:45.919 --> 39:47.526
Did he just call me a nigger?

39:47.561 --> 39:48.947
He has a little tourette's

39:48.982 --> 39:50.334
Thing going on in addition to

39:50.369 --> 39:51.499
Everything else.

39:51.534 --> 39:52.832
Right, uh, papa, I'm

39:52.867 --> 39:53.867
Puerto rican. If you want to

39:53.902 --> 39:54.884
Call me a name, at least try to

39:54.919 --> 39:55.867
Keep it in the right ballpark,

39:55.902 --> 39:57.033
OK?

39:57.068 --> 39:58.834
Keep walking. I'm tired.

39:58.869 --> 40:00.832
OK.

40:00.867 --> 40:02.198
Nigger.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.334
Whoa, whoa. What did you

40:03.369 --> 40:04.299
Just call me, man?

40:04.334 --> 40:06.300
Uh, hey, brother. It's cool.

40:06.335 --> 40:07.566
He was talking to me.

40:07.601 --> 40:08.732
Oh, it's cool, it's cool?

40:08.767 --> 40:09.684
He just calls you a nigger and

40:09.719 --> 40:10.601
That's cool? What kind of stupid

40:10.636 --> 40:11.818
Ass nigger are you?

40:11.853 --> 40:13.460
I'm puerto rican, man.

40:13.495 --> 40:15.033
Oh, goddamn spic.

40:15.068 --> 40:16.817
Look, man. We don't want any

40:16.852 --> 40:18.567
Problems, all right? It's cool.

40:24.267 --> 40:25.484
Nigger.

40:25.519 --> 40:26.626
OK, we got to go.

40:26.661 --> 40:27.781
Sorry, man. Sorry.

40:27.816 --> 40:28.901
Come on, guys.

40:30.534 --> 40:31.383
What the hell happened to my

40:31.418 --> 40:32.233
Bunker gear? It's like somebody

40:32.268 --> 40:33.501
Washed it and it shrank.

40:33.536 --> 40:34.734
That's mine. That's my

40:34.769 --> 40:35.851
New gear.

40:35.886 --> 40:36.899
What?

40:36.934 --> 40:38.100
You know, Maggie, she didn't

40:38.135 --> 40:39.351
Want to take my name after we

40:39.386 --> 40:40.593
Get married, so I thought I'd

40:40.628 --> 40:41.801
Take hers, you know? I'm gonna

40:41.836 --> 40:42.933
Be Sean Garrity-Gavin.

40:42.968 --> 40:44.734
You're shitting me, right?

40:44.769 --> 40:45.551
No. God, not at all.

40:45.586 --> 40:46.299
I mean, it's too many

40:46.334 --> 40:47.233
Goddamn letters to put on the

40:47.268 --> 40:48.250
Back. Plus there's that slashy

40:48.285 --> 40:49.233
Dashy thing. What's that called?

40:49.268 --> 40:50.098
The hyphen.

40:50.133 --> 40:51.367
Yeah, so I just, I thought

40:51.402 --> 40:52.685
I'd use yours. I mean, I know

40:52.720 --> 40:53.827
It's gonna be problematic seeing

40:53.862 --> 40:54.881
Us two brothers working at the

40:54.916 --> 40:55.901
Same house, but we'll figure

40:55.936 --> 40:57.866
It out.

40:57.901 --> 40:59.451
My life's officially in

40:59.486 --> 41:00.727
The shitter, by the way.

41:00.762 --> 41:01.933
Listen, don't look now,

41:01.968 --> 41:03.701
But you're going for another

41:03.736 --> 41:04.801
Lap around the bowl.

41:06.434 --> 41:07.434
Christ.

41:11.767 --> 41:13.365
Um...

41:13.400 --> 41:14.550
I'd call the cops, but looks

41:14.585 --> 41:15.701
Like they're already here.

41:15.736 --> 41:16.766
You all right?

41:16.801 --> 41:17.934
Yeah, I'll be all right.

41:23.801 --> 41:24.867
Hey.

41:27.934 --> 41:30.167
I'm here because, uh... you know,

41:30.202 --> 41:32.400
I didn't want you finding out

41:32.435 --> 41:33.667
From somebody else.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.901
Janet's pregnant.

41:44.734 --> 41:46.033
It wasn't planned.

41:46.068 --> 41:49.434
You know, it just happened.

41:49.469 --> 41:51.635
It is what it is.

41:51.670 --> 41:53.766
And we're happy.

41:53.801 --> 41:56.317
Obviously, we don't know what

41:56.352 --> 41:58.409
The sex of the child is, but

41:58.444 --> 42:00.605
Look at the upside, Tommy.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.687
If it's a boy, then dad can

42:02.722 --> 42:04.477
Stop with that whole male heir

42:04.512 --> 42:06.233
Bullshit thing that he keeps

42:06.268 --> 42:07.934
Talking about.

42:07.969 --> 42:09.601
OK, Tommy?

42:11.867 --> 42:15.701
You're asking me if it's OK?

42:15.736 --> 42:16.767
Yeah.

42:30.734 --> 42:32.233
Congratulations.

43:20.701 --> 43:21.968
You coming?

43:22.003 --> 43:23.367
Yeah.
