WEBVTT

00:01.336 --> 00:02.302
Last week...

00:02.337 --> 00:03.337
Whew!

00:03.371 --> 00:04.337
Oh, my gosh.

00:04.372 --> 00:05.605
- Ugh.
- Oh, my God.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.640
- Does anyone smell that?
- Ugh!

00:07.676 --> 00:09.377
After a smelly
elimination test...

00:09.457 --> 00:10.203
Whoo!

00:10.283 --> 00:12.679
Adam and Jaeclyn's time
in the MasterChef kitchen...

00:12.714 --> 00:15.121
You've been brilliant.
Keep that head up high.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.278
Came to an end.

00:19.906 --> 00:21.254
Whee!

00:21.289 --> 00:22.255
Tonight...

00:22.290 --> 00:23.656
Hold on, guys!

00:23.692 --> 00:25.425
Oh, my God!

00:25.644 --> 00:27.244
This is awesome.

00:27.279 --> 00:28.090
Go, go, go, go!

00:28.170 --> 00:30.881
The top 16 face
their first team challenge.

00:30.916 --> 00:32.029
Let's go!

00:32.109 --> 00:33.675
Cooking in the biggest
celebration

00:33.710 --> 00:34.943
in MasterChef Junior history.

00:34.978 --> 00:37.212
This is kids cooking
for a lot of kids.

00:37.247 --> 00:38.615
I don't know if we can do this.

00:38.695 --> 00:40.428
I feel like I'm gonna faint.

00:40.463 --> 00:42.797
Will the pint-sized chefs
rise to the occasion?

00:42.832 --> 00:44.599
- Agh!
- These ones are burnt!

00:44.634 --> 00:45.600
Or will the party...

00:45.635 --> 00:46.601
That is raw fish!

00:46.636 --> 00:47.936
End in disaster?

00:47.971 --> 00:50.505
They could be throwing up
and in the hospital.

00:57.213 --> 00:59.847
30 miles northwest
of the MasterChef kitchen...

01:03.119 --> 01:05.486
The remaining
16 junior home cooks

01:05.522 --> 01:08.489
have embarked on a field trip
to the Calamigos ranch

01:08.525 --> 01:10.458
in Malibu, California.

01:10.493 --> 01:11.859
This is really cool,

01:11.895 --> 01:13.372
being outside
of the MasterChef kitchen

01:13.396 --> 01:14.662
and getting some fresh air.

01:14.698 --> 01:16.631
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo!

01:17.901 --> 01:19.200
Hold on, guys!

01:21.671 --> 01:24.205
I'm not sure if Christina
knows how to drive this thing,

01:24.240 --> 01:27.008
and I'm not sure
she has her tractor license.

01:27.043 --> 01:30.111
Where are we going?

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.523 --> 01:42.156
We're pulling up in the tractor,

01:42.192 --> 01:43.658
and I see a Ferris wheel,

01:43.693 --> 01:45.360
I see a big, inflatable slide,

01:45.395 --> 01:47.028
I see games, I see rides.

01:47.063 --> 01:49.063
It's like pulling up
to, like, heaven.

01:49.099 --> 01:51.532
Oh, my God!

01:51.568 --> 01:54.369
I love bouncy houses.

01:54.404 --> 01:57.705
I wish my house
was a bouncy house.

01:57.741 --> 01:59.474
So this is awesome.

01:59.509 --> 02:02.010
Wait, where is Gordon
and Graham?

02:04.381 --> 02:06.514
Whoo!

02:07.684 --> 02:09.484
They're on the Ferris wheel!

02:09.519 --> 02:12.186
- Come on, guys!
- Whee!

02:12.222 --> 02:14.822
Oh, yeah, baby!

02:14.858 --> 02:17.025
Gordon!
Graham!

02:17.060 --> 02:18.426
Excellent.

02:18.461 --> 02:20.661
Guys, let's go!

02:20.697 --> 02:21.829
Sorry, guys.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.711
Line up over there.
Good to see everybody.

02:25.735 --> 02:28.269
Whoo!

02:28.304 --> 02:31.739
All of you, welcome
to Calamigos Ranch.

02:31.775 --> 02:34.108
Now, who likes
to have a good time?

02:34.144 --> 02:36.444
I do!

02:36.479 --> 02:40.048
Good, because we have invited

02:40.083 --> 02:43.184
a lot of very special people
to come and have fun

02:43.219 --> 02:45.286
at a very special birthday party
here today.

02:47.791 --> 02:50.625
You guys are all ages 8 to 13,

02:50.660 --> 02:53.361
and this birthday party
is for 8-year-olds

02:53.396 --> 02:55.530
and 9-year-olds
and 10-year-olds

02:55.565 --> 02:56.931
and 11-year-olds
and 12-year-olds

02:56.966 --> 02:59.133
and 13-year-olds.

02:59.169 --> 03:04.472
That's right, we have invited
a table of kids of each age.

03:04.507 --> 03:08.209
And you guys will be cooking
all the party food

03:08.244 --> 03:10.812
in two teams of eight.

03:13.483 --> 03:16.217
And all those birthday boys
and girls

03:16.252 --> 03:18.152
will be the ones deciding

03:18.188 --> 03:20.288
the winning team
of this challenge.

03:21.591 --> 03:24.459
Now, along with those 48 kids,

03:24.494 --> 03:28.129
there will be another table
of very special young guests.

03:28.164 --> 03:31.165
They won't be voting,
but they will be eating,

03:31.201 --> 03:33.668
and it'd be nice if you could
make them happy,

03:33.703 --> 03:37.138
because sitting at that table
will be my four children.

03:37.173 --> 03:39.740
Oh, my God!

03:39.776 --> 03:41.843
And of course,
Graham's three children.

03:41.878 --> 03:43.111
Whoo!

03:43.146 --> 03:44.245
I'm a little bit nervous,

03:44.280 --> 03:45.680
because Gordon and Graham's kids

03:45.715 --> 03:49.117
probably eat really
sophisticated dishes at home.

03:49.152 --> 03:50.852
So I know we really
have to elevate

03:50.887 --> 03:53.287
whatever we're making.

03:53.323 --> 03:54.589
Addison and Nate, since you had

03:54.624 --> 03:56.235
the best two dishes
from the last challenge,

03:56.259 --> 03:58.593
today you both will be
team captains.

03:58.628 --> 04:00.995
Please, come over here
and pick up your aprons.

04:02.398 --> 04:05.433
I am so happy
to be a team captain.

04:05.468 --> 04:07.835
On my softball team
back home in Illinois,

04:07.871 --> 04:10.938
I love to step up
and lead them to victory,

04:10.974 --> 04:12.640
and that's what
I'm gonna do today.

04:12.675 --> 04:15.042
Right, Addison,
you had the best dish

04:15.078 --> 04:16.377
in the previous challenge,

04:16.411 --> 04:18.646
so therefore,
you get to pick first.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.848
I think that this person

04:20.884 --> 04:23.384
is one of the best
young home cooks here,

04:23.419 --> 04:26.387
and I think she could
really inspire

04:26.422 --> 04:27.755
lots of home cooks.

04:27.790 --> 04:29.290
I am picking Kya.

04:29.325 --> 04:31.859
Kya, let's go, my darling.

04:33.329 --> 04:35.329
The youngest girl
is the first picked.

04:35.365 --> 04:37.398
I'm so happy that Addison
picked me first,

04:37.433 --> 04:40.168
because she is
a really strong competitor,

04:40.203 --> 04:43.237
and we work
really good together.

04:43.273 --> 04:44.405
Nate?

04:44.440 --> 04:47.208
I am choosing this person
because I think

04:47.243 --> 04:49.744
he has a lot of strength
in the kitchen.

04:49.779 --> 04:50.845
I choose Derek.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.313
Derek, wow.

04:52.348 --> 04:53.614
Back in Philly,

04:53.650 --> 04:56.150
I'm on a baseball team
and a football team,

04:56.186 --> 04:58.719
and I do very well
in a team environment.

04:58.755 --> 05:01.088
There's no way we're
gonna be losing this one.

05:01.124 --> 05:02.390
- Addison?
- Mia.

05:02.425 --> 05:03.524
- Let's go.
- Oh, yeah!

05:03.560 --> 05:04.870
- Mia, excellent.
- Thank you, Addison.

05:04.894 --> 05:06.227
Stand next to Kya, please.

05:06.262 --> 05:08.029
- Nate?
- I choose Sam.

05:08.064 --> 05:10.198
Sam, wow, let's go.
Well done, Sam.

05:10.233 --> 05:12.166
- Addison.
- Kaitlyn.

05:12.202 --> 05:13.612
- Kaitlyn, great choice.
- Thank you.

05:13.636 --> 05:15.036
Apron on, my darling, please.

05:15.071 --> 05:17.138
- JJ.
- JJ, let's go, bud.

05:17.173 --> 05:18.839
Thank you.
Apron on.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.575
- Addison.
- Corey.

05:20.610 --> 05:22.510
- Oh, thank you.
- Corey, great.

05:22.545 --> 05:24.345
- Apron on, bud.
- I choose Amaya.

05:24.380 --> 05:26.113
Amaya, let's go, little lady!

05:26.149 --> 05:28.182
Go and stand next to JJ,
please, let's go.

05:28.218 --> 05:30.017
- Zac.
- Wow, Zac, let's go.

05:30.053 --> 05:32.053
- Welcome to the Blue Team.
- Jesse.

05:32.088 --> 05:35.022
Jesse, welcome.
Good choice.

05:35.058 --> 05:36.123
Kamilly.

05:36.159 --> 05:38.192
Kamilly, put on the apron,
please, gorgeous.

05:38.228 --> 05:39.193
I choose Avery.

05:39.229 --> 05:41.229
Avery, let's go.

05:41.264 --> 05:43.731
Wow, thank you for that, Avery.

05:43.766 --> 05:44.932
Welc...

05:44.968 --> 05:47.368
Okay, last pick.

05:47.403 --> 05:49.437
I am picking Tae-Ho.

05:49.472 --> 05:51.706
Wow, let's go.

05:51.741 --> 05:53.174
Welcome to the Blue Team,
Tae-Ho.

05:53.209 --> 05:55.209
Which means, Ian,
you are on the Red Team.

05:55.245 --> 05:56.755
Come pick up your apron,
please, thank you.

05:56.779 --> 05:58.379
Hey, Ian, you know
what they say,

05:58.414 --> 05:59.914
they save the best for last.

05:59.949 --> 06:01.249
- Right.
- Let's go.

06:01.284 --> 06:03.951
Nate and Addison,
go and join your teams.

06:03.987 --> 06:05.786
I am so happy to be
on Nate's team,

06:05.822 --> 06:08.723
'cause he has
a lot of sophisticated skills,

06:08.758 --> 06:11.325
and I like red color,
and I'm wearing a red shirt.

06:11.361 --> 06:13.828
So go red!

06:13.863 --> 06:17.398
Today you're gonna be serving
the people at this party

06:17.433 --> 06:19.300
three of our kids'
favorite dishes:

06:19.335 --> 06:20.768
Awesome fish tacos,

06:20.803 --> 06:23.604
incredible chicken wings
with an amazing sauce,

06:23.640 --> 06:26.440
and a stellar
homemade turkey burger

06:26.476 --> 06:29.076
with toppings of your choice.

06:29.112 --> 06:31.479
Each team is gonna have
just one hour

06:31.514 --> 06:34.749
to make all those dishes
and 40 minutes to serve 'em.

06:34.784 --> 06:37.752
Now, guys, you can interpret
those three dishes

06:37.787 --> 06:40.221
any way you'd like, but remember

06:40.256 --> 06:44.225
who you're cooking for:
Kids just like you.

06:44.260 --> 06:46.294
The team with the most votes
will win the challenge

06:46.329 --> 06:49.230
and move on to the next stage
of the competition.

06:49.265 --> 06:52.199
The losing team will be
facing a pressure test

06:52.235 --> 06:54.001
back in the MasterChef kitchen.

06:55.271 --> 06:58.639
The first pressure test
of "MasterChef Junior."

06:58.675 --> 07:00.775
Red Team, Blue Team,
are you ready?

07:00.810 --> 07:02.276
Yes, Chef!

07:02.312 --> 07:05.680
Your time starts...

07:05.715 --> 07:07.515
now.

07:07.550 --> 07:09.517
Both teams of junior home cooks

07:09.552 --> 07:11.552
must quickly decide
on a strategy

07:11.587 --> 07:13.454
to prepare the three
different menu items

07:13.489 --> 07:15.856
for today's
birthday celebration.

07:15.892 --> 07:18.125
For the fish tacos,
we're gonna make mango salsa.

07:18.161 --> 07:19.226
Write that down.

07:19.262 --> 07:20.895
For my turkey burgers,

07:20.930 --> 07:23.364
I want sesame seed buns
and tomatoes, red onion.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.366
And then honey barbecue wings,
okay?

07:25.401 --> 07:26.367
And a sauce?

07:26.402 --> 07:27.968
Lemon zest Sriracha
and mayonnaise.

07:28.004 --> 07:29.370
Got it.

07:29.405 --> 07:32.039
Back home in Illinois, we cook
these things all the time.

07:32.075 --> 07:33.841
So we gotta hit this
out of the park

07:33.876 --> 07:35.376
and win this challenge.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.122
Kya, all right,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

07:37.146 --> 07:39.613
As the Blue Team
confidently executes

07:39.649 --> 07:44.051
Captain Addison's menu,

07:44.087 --> 07:46.887
over on the Red Team,
Captain Nate

07:46.923 --> 07:50.358
is struggling to find
his voice as the leader.

07:50.393 --> 07:51.670
Hang on, hang on.
Everybody back up.

07:51.694 --> 07:53.227
I need space, I need space.

07:53.262 --> 07:54.929
Me and Amaya are doing burgers.

07:54.964 --> 07:56.564
All right, you two
are gonna do burgers.

07:56.599 --> 07:57.732
But we have a disagreement.

07:57.767 --> 07:59.345
She wants to put vegetables
on the burger.

07:59.369 --> 08:01.402
Who doesn't love tomatoes
on their burger?

08:01.437 --> 08:03.104
Yeah, I don't like tomatoes.

08:03.139 --> 08:05.406
Nate may not be
the strongest leader.

08:05.441 --> 08:07.241
He's not in control right now.

08:07.276 --> 08:09.276
If our team's going to win
this challenge,

08:09.312 --> 08:11.112
he has to get everybody
working together.

08:11.147 --> 08:12.613
That's too many people!

08:12.648 --> 08:14.882
Guys, guys, please don't argue.

08:14.917 --> 08:16.217
I don't want this to go bad.

08:16.252 --> 08:17.930
I really want to stay
in this competition, guys.

08:17.954 --> 08:19.120
- Don't you?
- Yes.

08:19.155 --> 08:22.289
Now let's get to work.

08:22.325 --> 08:24.091
- Wow, this is it.
- This is intense.

08:24.127 --> 08:27.094
I mean, this is kids
cooking for a lot of kids.

08:27.130 --> 08:28.907
Let's look at the captains.
Addison, for instance.

08:28.931 --> 08:30.698
I mean, she plays
a lot of sports.

08:30.733 --> 08:32.366
Can she bring that level
of assertiveness

08:32.402 --> 08:33.366
to her team today?

08:33.403 --> 08:34.635
Go, go, go, go, go!

08:34.669 --> 08:36.102
Addy, how much more guac
do we need?

08:36.139 --> 08:38.105
Just make as much as you can.

08:38.140 --> 08:39.273
Nate as a captain?

08:39.308 --> 08:41.708
Nate needs his team
to really take him seriously,

08:41.744 --> 08:43.744
and I think he operates great
as a one-man team.

08:43.780 --> 08:46.113
Can he operate great
as a team captain?

08:46.149 --> 08:48.215
Oh, the wings.
Why did we sauce 'em?

08:48.251 --> 08:49.251
This is not the sauce.

08:49.285 --> 08:50.251
We're just putting
a little coating.

08:50.286 --> 08:51.786
Oh, okay, Sam.

08:51.821 --> 08:53.098
I think that
the most important thing

08:53.122 --> 08:54.299
for any captain is not to panic.

08:54.323 --> 08:55.423
Yep.

08:55.458 --> 08:56.602
It's about being
a vocal leader too, right,

08:56.626 --> 08:59.293
so that each member knows
what they're playing

08:59.328 --> 09:01.162
into the team's victory.

09:02.632 --> 09:04.732
Where are the baskets, guys?

09:04.767 --> 09:06.500
- You're making a mess, Ian.
- I'm not.

09:06.536 --> 09:08.102
Yes, you are!

09:08.137 --> 09:10.337
Right from the get-go,
the team is all over the place,

09:10.373 --> 09:12.184
and no one's doing
what they're supposed to do.

09:12.208 --> 09:13.285
- Nate! Hey, Nate!
- Nate, can we start

09:13.309 --> 09:14.642
to work on the fish?
Hey!

09:14.677 --> 09:16.622
- Aw, Nate! I'm helping you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

09:16.646 --> 09:18.112
We gotta... Ugh!

09:18.147 --> 09:19.658
Everybody is running
around the kitchen,

09:19.682 --> 09:20.915
they're asking me questions,

09:20.950 --> 09:22.110
they're asking me what to do.

09:23.286 --> 09:25.152
Guys, guys, guys, guys!

09:25.188 --> 09:26.265
I feel like I'm gonna faint.

09:26.289 --> 09:27.588
Ugh!

09:27.623 --> 09:28.767
Red Team's all over the place.

09:28.791 --> 09:30.090
- Hey, Nate!
- Guys, let me...

09:31.260 --> 09:32.660
Taste this, taste this.

09:32.695 --> 09:33.961
Oh, my God!

09:41.165 --> 09:42.865
For this team challenge,

09:42.900 --> 09:45.034
the junior home cooks
have 60 minutes

09:45.069 --> 09:47.870
to prepare three different
kid-friendly menu options

09:47.905 --> 09:49.538
for the young guests

09:49.574 --> 09:52.808
at the "MasterChef Junior"
mega birthday bash.

09:52.844 --> 09:55.111
Everyone's doing awesome.
Keep up the good work.

09:55.146 --> 09:58.280
Over on the Red Team,
Nate is feeling overwhelmed

09:58.316 --> 10:01.150
by the responsibility
of being team captain.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.169
Hey, Nate, taste this.

10:04.205 --> 10:05.504
Oh, my God!

10:07.341 --> 10:09.741
Please get a grip.
We gotta do this, come on!

10:09.777 --> 10:11.910
Red Team's all over the place.

10:11.946 --> 10:13.712
Nate isn't making decisions.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.348
No one knows what they're doing
or what they're making.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.484
Nate, two seconds, please.

10:18.519 --> 10:20.085
Sure.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.787
I'm seeing a few of the Red Team

10:21.822 --> 10:23.366
walking around with their hands
in their pockets,

10:23.390 --> 10:25.691
and it doesn't look like
you organized them.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.927
And FYI, over that wall there
in the Blue Team,

10:28.963 --> 10:32.097
Addison is organizing
her team beyond belief.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.932
- Fry all the wings.
- Yes, Chef!

10:33.968 --> 10:36.435
We're good, guys.
We're gonna win this challenge.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.036
Get organized, young man.
Let's go.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.372
Gordon Ramsay's right.

10:40.407 --> 10:43.342
I need to pull my team together
and lead them to victory.

10:43.377 --> 10:44.977
Derek, you're doing the burgers.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.845
Start prepping more.
Salt and pepper 'em.

10:46.881 --> 10:50.516
I'm putting JJ, Avery,
and Derek on burgers.

10:50.551 --> 10:51.795
Jesse, how are
those wings doing?

10:51.819 --> 10:53.151
Good.

10:53.187 --> 10:54.598
I'm putting Jesse and Sam
on chicken wings

10:54.622 --> 10:55.754
with an Asian sauce.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.367
Amaya, you're gonna work
with me and Ian.

10:57.391 --> 11:00.559
I'm cooking fish tacos
with mango pineapple salsa

11:00.594 --> 11:03.095
with Amaya and Ian.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.230
That's great!
All right, guys, come on!

11:05.266 --> 11:07.065
We can pull ourselves
back together!

11:07.101 --> 11:10.335
With only 20 minutes left
before the guests arrive,

11:10.371 --> 11:12.070
a newly organized Red Team

11:12.106 --> 11:14.907
hustles to make up
for lost time,

11:14.942 --> 11:17.342
while the Blue Team
continues to work

11:17.378 --> 11:19.978
on Captain Addison's fiery menu.

11:20.014 --> 11:22.814
Addison, tell me exactly what
you have going on.

11:22.850 --> 11:26.051
For my fish tacos,
we have spice crusted fish.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.119
And who's on wings?

11:27.154 --> 11:28.353
Tae-Ho and Zac.

11:28.389 --> 11:30.956
We are making Sriracha
with lemon.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.791
- Wow, so you're going spicy?
- We are.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.060
Think about... a lot of these kids
are used to eating

11:35.095 --> 11:36.495
kind of like everyday food,

11:36.530 --> 11:38.697
but if this fish taco's
too spicy,

11:38.732 --> 11:42.100
if the Sriracha aioli
going with barbecued wings

11:42.136 --> 11:43.280
are too hot, then they're gonna

11:43.304 --> 11:45.037
have to vote for the Red Team
just because

11:45.072 --> 11:47.372
that's gonna be the one that's
not killing their palates.

11:47.408 --> 11:49.374
Tae-Ho, a little bit,
not too much.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.810
- Okay, good luck.
- Thank you.

11:51.845 --> 11:55.147
Okay, guys, I'm gonna add
a little bit more lemon pepper.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.449
Red Team, Blue Team!

11:57.484 --> 12:00.152
Your birthday party kids
are arriving!

12:01.455 --> 12:04.690
And they're led by our children!

12:04.725 --> 12:06.325
Oh, my gosh!

12:06.360 --> 12:07.426
Welcome, guys!

12:08.862 --> 12:10.963
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

12:14.902 --> 12:17.936
It's very exciting that kids
our age are cooking for us.

12:17.972 --> 12:20.038
Definitely something
that doesn't happen every day.

12:20.074 --> 12:23.842
I can't wait to see what food
comes out of the kitchen.

12:23.877 --> 12:26.778
I'm so excited that kids,
like, my age cooking this food,

12:26.814 --> 12:29.414
but these kids are 8 years old,
and I'm 12,

12:29.450 --> 12:31.617
and they can do
way more than I can even do.

12:31.652 --> 12:34.620
I'm ready for the food.
I can't wait to eat.

12:34.655 --> 12:36.288
Hey, Sam, how do you think
these look?

12:36.323 --> 12:37.522
A little longer, right?

12:37.558 --> 12:38.890
No, that looks good.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.593
Me and Sam have never even
worked with a fryer before,

12:41.629 --> 12:43.562
so it's really hard.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.998
Guys, what's happening here?

12:46.033 --> 12:49.167
Jesse, these ones are burnt!

12:49.203 --> 12:51.637
I don't know why
Jesse and Sam think

12:51.672 --> 12:53.105
chicken wings need to be black.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.551
They're supposed to be
a nice crispy golden brown.

12:54.575 --> 12:55.941
If we keep burning everything,

12:55.976 --> 12:57.520
then we're not gonna have
any more food!

12:57.544 --> 13:00.345
Those are all overcooked.
You gotta throw 'em all away.

13:00.381 --> 13:02.180
Yeah, if they're
black like this,

13:02.216 --> 13:04.182
we can't use 'em.
That just makes people sick,

13:04.218 --> 13:06.785
so start going
with this new batch, okay?

13:06.820 --> 13:09.054
Just worry about how
these come out.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.589
So as quickly as possible,

13:10.624 --> 13:13.225
me and Sam are trying
to redo the chicken wings.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.349
I do not want to go
into that pressure test,

13:15.429 --> 13:17.896
so I'm watching them
super carefully,

13:17.931 --> 13:19.531
making sure
they don't get burnt.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.944
Don't let that chicken
get too dark!

13:20.968 --> 13:22.534
Okay.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.403
While Sam and Jesse
hustle to correct

13:24.438 --> 13:28.073
the wing issues
for the Red Team...

13:28.108 --> 13:29.508
All right, Kaitlyn.

13:29.543 --> 13:30.776
Over on the Blue Team,

13:30.811 --> 13:32.377
Chef Ramsay is concerned

13:32.413 --> 13:35.614
about the preparation
of the fish for their tacos.

13:35.649 --> 13:36.915
What's the seasoning on this?

13:36.950 --> 13:38.383
Um, I don't know, Mia...

13:38.419 --> 13:40.130
You don't know?
You should know what's seasoning

13:40.154 --> 13:41.765
on there, 'cause you're
cooking it, my darling.

13:41.789 --> 13:43.021
- Mia!
- Yeah?

13:43.057 --> 13:44.256
What's on the fish?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.091
It's, like, a mixture
of cumin, paprika...

13:46.126 --> 13:47.426
Why is it so spicy?

13:47.461 --> 13:50.195
These are for kids,
you know that, right?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.431
There's too much spice
on the fish.

13:52.466 --> 13:54.332
We have a really big problem.

13:54.368 --> 13:56.268
This would be fine
if we were cooking

13:56.303 --> 13:57.847
for, like, Gordon, Graham,
and Christina,

13:57.871 --> 13:59.237
but we're cooking for kids.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.239
If it's too spicy,
we're gonna lose their vote.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.675
Guys, we need to start over
on the fish.

14:03.711 --> 14:06.144
We don't have any more fish.

14:06.180 --> 14:10.215
Blue Team, ten minutes
before we start serving!

14:10.250 --> 14:12.617
We have just ten minutes left.

14:12.653 --> 14:15.721
What are we going to do?

14:15.756 --> 14:17.122
I don't know if we can do this.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.962
Join me and some of
your favorite past contestants

14:23.997 --> 14:26.498
as we set sail
on a "MasterChef" cruise

14:26.533 --> 14:30.335
Experience the excitement live
with cooking demos, challenges,

14:30.370 --> 14:32.237
and mystery boxes.

14:32.272 --> 14:35.373
Got to fox.com/masterchef
to learn more.

14:39.042 --> 14:42.497
Blue Team, there's
too much spice on the fish.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.766
Guys, we need to start over
on the fish.

14:44.802 --> 14:47.169
We don't have any more fish.

14:47.204 --> 14:49.671
I am so sorry.
I need to rinse it off.

14:49.707 --> 14:52.007
So I know we
have to fix this fast.

14:52.042 --> 14:55.877
I rinse off the fish,
scrape off the original rub,

14:55.913 --> 14:57.879
and then I put on a new rub,

14:57.915 --> 15:00.315
which is olive oil,
salt, and pepper.

15:00.350 --> 15:01.683
We need tacos now.

15:01.719 --> 15:04.453
Red Team, Blue Team,
60 seconds to go

15:04.488 --> 15:06.121
before we start serving!

15:06.156 --> 15:07.122
Yes, Chef!

15:07.157 --> 15:10.459
All right, guys, come on!
Go, go!

15:10.494 --> 15:13.628
For service today,
the Red Team is offering

15:13.664 --> 15:15.764
a turkey burger
with cheddar cheese

15:15.799 --> 15:17.566
on a toasted wheat bun,

15:17.601 --> 15:20.969
Asian style chicken wings
with a hoisin sauce,

15:21.004 --> 15:25.340
and fish tacos with coleslaw
and a pineapple mango salsa.

15:25.375 --> 15:29.611
I need 16 of everything!
Kaitlyn, we need tacos now.

15:29.646 --> 15:31.646
I got it!
Hurry.

15:31.682 --> 15:34.216
The Blue Team is serving
a turkey burger

15:34.251 --> 15:38.186
with swiss and cheddar cheese
on a sesame seed bun,

15:38.222 --> 15:42.023
honey barbecue wings
with a Sriracha aioli sauce,

15:42.059 --> 15:47.262
and fish tacos with puréed
mango salsa and guacamole.

15:47.297 --> 15:48.597
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

15:48.632 --> 15:50.065
The winner of today's challenge

15:50.100 --> 15:52.701
will be decided
by the birthday party guests,

15:52.736 --> 15:54.736
who will taste
an identical menu item

15:54.772 --> 15:58.740
from each team and then vote
for the one they like best.

16:00.110 --> 16:01.576
Blue Team, are you ready?

16:01.612 --> 16:02.811
Yes, Chef!

16:02.846 --> 16:04.079
Red Team, are you ready?

16:04.114 --> 16:05.247
Yes, Chef!

16:05.282 --> 16:07.616
Let's go!

16:07.651 --> 16:08.784
Ay-yi-yi!

16:08.819 --> 16:09.851
- Nate?
- What?

16:09.887 --> 16:11.231
- I need servers.
- I got it, Nate!

16:11.255 --> 16:12.966
The kids are arriving.
Get on the front, let's go.

16:12.990 --> 16:14.890
I got it!
Here you go.

16:14.925 --> 16:17.325
Step right up,
get your turkey burgers!

16:17.361 --> 16:18.627
Guys, well done!

16:18.662 --> 16:20.695
My team's actually doing
pretty well.

16:20.731 --> 16:23.565
The fish tacos are going great,
JJ's doing well on the burgers,

16:23.600 --> 16:25.567
and Sam's sauce
for the chicken wings

16:25.602 --> 16:26.935
is very, very good.

16:26.970 --> 16:28.414
It's not how you start,
it's how you finish,

16:28.438 --> 16:29.838
and we are just
pulling it together.

16:29.873 --> 16:30.939
Hope you enjoy.

16:33.677 --> 16:35.188
- Chicken.
- Chicken wings, here you go.

16:35.212 --> 16:37.946
We are getting
all the plates out fast,

16:37.981 --> 16:40.482
and Addison is being
a really great team leader.

16:40.517 --> 16:42.717
- I need more burgers, guys!
- Okay.

16:42.753 --> 16:43.985
We are very organized

16:44.021 --> 16:45.687
and everyone is
getting the work done.

16:45.722 --> 16:47.088
I think we're gonna do
pretty good.

16:47.124 --> 16:48.423
Chicken wings.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.003
Keep it going, Blue Team,
well done, let's go!

16:50.027 --> 16:52.060
There you go.

16:53.230 --> 16:54.507
- Hungry people!
- Come on, come on!

16:54.531 --> 16:55.864
Turkey burger, please.

16:55.899 --> 16:56.865
- Here you go.
- Turkey.

16:56.900 --> 16:57.866
Thank you so much.

16:57.901 --> 16:59.501
Could I have chicken wings,
please?

16:59.536 --> 17:01.403
I think Gordon's kids
are definitely

17:01.438 --> 17:04.138
like little mini Gordons
with cool accents.

17:04.174 --> 17:05.473
Thank you.

17:05.509 --> 17:08.042
And Graham's kids are
just like Mini-Mes of him.

17:08.078 --> 17:09.044
Oh, my gosh,
it's Gordon Ramsay's son.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.244
Hi.
Hi.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.946
Turkey burger, please.

17:11.982 --> 17:12.948
Oh, my gosh, I love his accent.

17:12.983 --> 17:14.316
Thank you so much.

17:14.351 --> 17:17.551
Jack is so cute!
Whoa.

17:17.588 --> 17:19.454
- Thank you.
- They're amazing, trust me.

17:19.489 --> 17:21.957
Can I steal your accent?

17:21.992 --> 17:25.393
Out in the dining area, some
of the birthday party guests

17:25.429 --> 17:27.762
are beginning to vote
by taking the plunge

17:27.798 --> 17:30.232
down the giant slide
and ringing the bell

17:30.267 --> 17:32.701
for the team whose food
they preferred.

17:32.736 --> 17:35.470
I had the fish tacos
and I like the Red Team,

17:35.505 --> 17:38.373
because it was juicy and sweet.

17:38.408 --> 17:41.743
Hey, guys, I got
a big tray of fish here.

17:41.778 --> 17:44.412
The Blue Team did a better job
with the turkey burger.

17:44.448 --> 17:46.348
They put onions,
which made it have

17:46.383 --> 17:49.551
more flavor than the Red Team.

17:49.586 --> 17:54.689
While the votes
continue to pour in...

17:54.725 --> 17:56.024
back in the kitchen,

17:56.059 --> 17:58.526
the Red Team hits a road block
in their service.

17:58.562 --> 18:00.240
Wings, wings!
We got another order of wings!

18:00.264 --> 18:01.930
- Wings!
- We're out of wings.

18:01.965 --> 18:03.965
What?

18:04.001 --> 18:05.834
If he ordered a wing,
we have to give him

18:05.869 --> 18:09.204
an empty basket, because
we burnt some of our wings.

18:09.239 --> 18:12.274
We ran out of chicken wings
because they're all burnt,

18:12.309 --> 18:14.075
and we're gonna lose votes.

18:14.111 --> 18:16.278
This is bad, really bad.

18:16.313 --> 18:17.579
Ugh!

18:17.614 --> 18:20.548
All right, guys, make the best
fish tacos of your life!

18:20.584 --> 18:24.085
As the Red Team races to serve
their final few customers

18:24.121 --> 18:26.254
and cross the finish line
on a high note...

18:26.290 --> 18:27.956
We can do this!

18:27.991 --> 18:30.792
Over on the Blue Team,
Captain Addison has discovered

18:30.827 --> 18:33.628
a major problem
with their fish tacos.

18:33.664 --> 18:34.996
Wait, is this cooked?

18:35.032 --> 18:36.598
- That isn't cooked.
- Raw!

18:36.633 --> 18:38.633
That is raw fish.

18:38.669 --> 18:42.938
It's embarrassing.
If we serve the kids raw food,

18:42.973 --> 18:45.140
they could be throwing up
and in the hospital.

18:45.175 --> 18:48.276
I'm sorry.
We've lost two votes, guys.

18:48.312 --> 18:50.679
With service winding down,
the Blue Team must

18:50.714 --> 18:54.082
quickly make a new batch
of fish to stop losing votes.

18:56.586 --> 18:58.298
You're throwing down
on those wings, how are they?

18:58.322 --> 18:59.654
I think I like the Red Team.

18:59.690 --> 19:02.257
Who's going with Red Team?

19:03.327 --> 19:05.660
Right, who had the burgers?

19:05.696 --> 19:07.028
Which one do you prefer?

19:07.064 --> 19:09.331
The burger from the Blue Team
had a sesame seed bun,

19:09.366 --> 19:13.001
and it was juicier and
I thought it tasted better.

19:14.604 --> 19:15.804
Holly, what did you have?

19:15.839 --> 19:18.139
I had fish tacos.
I prefer the Blue Team taco

19:18.175 --> 19:21.276
because the mango was puréed
and had guacamole to go with it.

19:21.311 --> 19:22.510
Nice.

19:22.546 --> 19:24.913
Fish tacos are perfect.
Keep going them like that.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.316
There you go, big man.

19:28.352 --> 19:29.384
Have a nice day.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.252
We're done serving.
Well done!

19:31.288 --> 19:34.055
Even though we had rough
patches, we had good food,

19:34.091 --> 19:35.557
we had really good teamwork,

19:35.592 --> 19:37.592
we had pretty good
communications.

19:37.627 --> 19:40.061
As team captain, I'm feeling
pretty confident right now.

19:40.097 --> 19:41.329
Good luck, guys.

19:43.967 --> 19:46.334
We did it.
Everyone is served.

19:46.370 --> 19:48.570
Being a team captain
was definitely

19:48.605 --> 19:50.739
one of the hardest things
I've ever done,

19:50.774 --> 19:53.641
but I learned so much,

19:53.677 --> 19:56.978
and I think that we did
an amazing job.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.550
With service now complete,

20:02.586 --> 20:05.153
the final few votes
are being cast to determine

20:05.188 --> 20:08.456
the winner of today's
birthday party challenge.

20:16.767 --> 20:21.336
Did you all enjoy
your birthday lunches?

20:21.371 --> 20:23.204
Yeah!

20:23.240 --> 20:24.873
I'm glad to hear it.

20:24.908 --> 20:28.676
Now, Red Team, Blue Team,
great job all around,

20:28.712 --> 20:31.379
but like any competition,

20:31.415 --> 20:35.350
there can only be
one winning team.

20:35.385 --> 20:37.952
Unfortunately, the other team

20:37.988 --> 20:40.021
will have to face
the pressure test

20:40.057 --> 20:42.524
back in the MasterChef Junior
kitchen.

20:44.161 --> 20:47.962
The winning team,
by the smallest of margins...

20:49.866 --> 20:51.066
Congratulations...

20:55.205 --> 20:56.371
Blue Team!

21:00.877 --> 21:04.813
We won, and I am
so proud of my team.

21:04.848 --> 21:08.516
Being a team captain
and leading my team to victory

21:08.552 --> 21:11.019
is just an amazing feeling.

21:11.054 --> 21:14.889
Right, Red Team, before we head
back to the MasterChef kitchen,

21:14.925 --> 21:18.660
please give both kitchens
a good clean-down,

21:18.695 --> 21:22.030
and Blue Team, with Christina,
Graham, and myself,

21:22.065 --> 21:23.998
let's all go
to the bounce house!

21:26.336 --> 21:28.103
Let's go, bounce house!

21:28.138 --> 21:31.239
Let's go, let's go!
Yay!

21:31.274 --> 21:32.607
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Yay!

21:34.144 --> 21:37.212
One, two, three.

21:38.782 --> 21:41.149
It's so fun jumping
in the bouncy house

21:41.184 --> 21:43.284
with Christina, Graham,
and Gordon.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.687
Bounce house!
Come on!

21:45.722 --> 21:48.957
I feel like it's
my whole team's birthday!

21:48.992 --> 21:50.658
Good job, Blue Team.
Well done.

21:54.764 --> 21:57.165
Guys, come here.
You did great today.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.667
You all made me proud,
you made your families proud,

21:59.703 --> 22:01.569
you made Gordon, Christina,
and Graham proud.

22:01.605 --> 22:03.238
It was beautiful.
Way to go, guys.

22:03.273 --> 22:06.841
Even though we lost,
we had a great time.

22:06.877 --> 22:08.109
I think today was my fault.

22:08.145 --> 22:10.645
I mean, I could've
done better as a captain,

22:10.680 --> 22:13.181
but I'm just really happy
for the Blue Team.

22:13.261 --> 22:14.349
Let's go.

22:14.384 --> 22:16.784
We win as a team
and we lose as a team.

22:25.415 --> 22:26.381
All right.

22:26.416 --> 22:29.184
Ain't no thing
but a chicken wing.

22:34.523 --> 22:35.490
Oh.

22:35.525 --> 22:37.025
Come on down, guys, please.

22:37.060 --> 22:39.928
We just lost the team challenge.
It's kind of a bummer,

22:39.963 --> 22:42.330
because now we have to face

22:42.365 --> 22:44.199
the first pressure test
in MasterChef Junior.

22:44.234 --> 22:46.167
Oh, my gosh, what is that?

22:46.203 --> 22:48.770
I have no idea what's behind
that orange curtain of theirs

22:48.805 --> 22:53.508
and we have no idea
what they're gonna do to us.

22:53.543 --> 22:57.045
Red Team, it is time
to face the pressure test.

22:58.615 --> 23:01.049
And I'm sorry to say,
at the end of the challenge,

23:01.084 --> 23:03.118
we're gonna be sending
some of you home.

23:04.921 --> 23:06.054
Are you ready to find out

23:06.089 --> 23:08.389
what all of you
are gonna have to make tonight?

23:08.425 --> 23:09.958
Yes, Chef.

23:13.730 --> 23:17.165
So, guys, it's a dessert.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.166
Oh, God.

23:18.201 --> 23:21.636
But not just any dessert.

23:21.671 --> 23:23.671
It's a classic French dessert.

23:26.243 --> 23:29.577
A stunning...

23:32.282 --> 23:36.217
Oh!
Oh, my God, no!

23:36.253 --> 23:38.520
It's a Christmas tree
of cream puffs!

23:38.555 --> 23:41.823
That's right,
a stunning croquembouche.

23:41.858 --> 23:43.324
Oh, God,
this can't be happening.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.293
Spectacular cone of cream puffs

23:45.328 --> 23:48.463
bound with threads
of delicious caramel.

23:49.466 --> 23:50.765
Oh, boy.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.345
Croquembouche,
I have never made 'em before.

23:52.369 --> 23:53.768
I've never tasted one before.

23:53.803 --> 23:55.448
I've never even heard
of croquembouche before.

23:55.472 --> 23:58.473
I mean, back in Philly, we're
all cheesesteaks and pleasure.

23:58.508 --> 24:00.408
I mean, we don't have
croquembouche.

24:00.443 --> 24:03.444
Look at that light, delicious,
crunchy pastry.

24:03.480 --> 24:06.214
It's stuffed with a rich
cream filling inside.

24:06.249 --> 24:09.384
They are piled high to make
a delicious, death-defying,

24:09.419 --> 24:11.786
very decadent dessert.

24:14.224 --> 24:15.190
- Oh.
- You got it.

24:15.225 --> 24:16.191
Graham, you got two seconds,
please?

24:16.226 --> 24:17.192
Yeah.

24:17.227 --> 24:18.437
Sorry, just stand there
a little bit.

24:18.461 --> 24:19.539
- Yeah, of course.
- To the left a little bit.

24:19.563 --> 24:21.229
One, two, three.

24:24.167 --> 24:25.133
- Thank you very much.
- You got it?

24:25.168 --> 24:26.234
- Yeah, down.
- All right.

24:26.269 --> 24:27.235
- Excellent, thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

24:27.270 --> 24:30.104
Wow.
How beautiful is that?

24:30.140 --> 24:32.407
- Wow.
- It's gorgeous.

24:32.442 --> 24:34.909
Now, this is the best part,
trust me.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.812
- Ooh, can we eat some?
- Ooh!

24:37.847 --> 24:38.847
Ohh.

24:39.849 --> 24:40.815
Yum.

24:40.850 --> 24:41.894
Sorry, Graham, this is all mine.

24:41.918 --> 24:44.652
Oh, man.

24:44.688 --> 24:46.654
Mmm!

24:46.690 --> 24:51.059
Guys, a cream puff tower
of this size

24:51.094 --> 24:52.994
is really tough to make.

24:53.029 --> 24:56.064
Pastry chefs spend years
learning to make it.

24:56.099 --> 24:57.232
I know I did.

24:57.267 --> 24:59.334
It has so many
different elements

24:59.369 --> 25:01.402
that all have to work together,

25:01.438 --> 25:05.940
and it all has to stay
standing up tall.

25:05.976 --> 25:09.143
Luckily for you guys, you don't
have to make one this tall.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.613
Yeah, baby, whoo-hoo!

25:11.648 --> 25:16.017
You only have to make it...

25:16.052 --> 25:17.052
This tall.

25:18.288 --> 25:20.321
You guys have just 90 minutes
to make us

25:20.357 --> 25:22.824
a stunning, delicious
croquembouche

25:22.859 --> 25:25.426
just like this one.

25:25.462 --> 25:27.895
It's time to head
to your stations.

25:29.366 --> 25:32.367
I am a pro at desserts,

25:32.402 --> 25:37.972
so I think that this is gonna be
a piece of croquembouche.

25:38.008 --> 25:39.807
Now, on your stations,
you all have

25:39.843 --> 25:41.943
the exact same ingredients

25:41.978 --> 25:44.779
to make your incredible
cream puff tower.

25:44.814 --> 25:47.015
Right, is everybody ready?

25:47.050 --> 25:48.750
Yes, Chef!

25:48.785 --> 25:51.619
Your 90 minutes...

25:51.655 --> 25:55.957
starts...

25:55.992 --> 25:57.225
now!
Whoo!

25:57.260 --> 25:58.660
- Come on, guys!
- Come on, guys!

25:58.695 --> 26:00.295
Ugh.

26:01.898 --> 26:03.442
Come on, Amaya, you can do this!
Hurry up.

26:03.466 --> 26:05.333
I'm one of the only people here

26:05.368 --> 26:06.734
who's made a croquembouche
before.

26:06.770 --> 26:08.214
I think that's a pretty good
advantage for me.

26:08.238 --> 26:12.140
90 minutes is plenty of time.
I got it.

26:12.175 --> 26:14.776
A croquembouche is
an unfamiliar dish to me,

26:14.811 --> 26:17.979
but I'm gonna try to pull myself
together and get this done.

26:18.014 --> 26:19.781
You gotta have
the right time management.

26:19.816 --> 26:21.349
Otherwise, you're going home.

26:22.919 --> 26:25.253
I'm feeling pretty good
about this croquembouche.

26:25.288 --> 26:28.890
I've never done this before,
but I love cream puffs,

26:28.925 --> 26:31.793
so I'm gonna try to do
the best I can.

26:31.828 --> 26:33.628
So 90 minutes.
It sounds a long time,

26:33.663 --> 26:34.807
but come on, this is technical.

26:34.831 --> 26:36.364
First things first, cream puffs.

26:36.399 --> 26:38.466
Water, butter, sugar, and salt.

26:38.501 --> 26:39.834
- Yes.
- From there,

26:39.869 --> 26:43.071
you take a wooden spoon
and you spoon in your flour.

26:43.106 --> 26:45.173
I'm gonna get
a whole lot stronger doing this.

26:45.208 --> 26:47.408
And then you take that mixture,

26:47.444 --> 26:50.645
you add it to a stand mixer
with a paddle attachment

26:50.680 --> 26:52.714
to cool down that pastry dough.

26:52.749 --> 26:56.317
After 20 minutes, they should be
in a position to start piping.

26:56.353 --> 26:59.187
Pipe, pipe, pipe, into the oven.

26:59.222 --> 27:01.189
This mini croquembouche tonight,

27:01.224 --> 27:02.435
how many puffs
in one recipe? I mean...

27:02.459 --> 27:05.026
I would look to make
about 30 cream puffs,

27:05.061 --> 27:07.295
but it's also not just
about building the structure,

27:07.330 --> 27:09.831
and I think there's nothing
more disheartening

27:09.866 --> 27:11.299
than a dessert that
looks beautiful

27:11.334 --> 27:13.301
and doesn't taste great.
It needs to be both.

27:16.339 --> 27:18.806
I'm nervous for Nate.
He's on his third piping bag,

27:18.842 --> 27:21.743
and every time he's put in
more mixture inside those bags,

27:21.778 --> 27:23.845
you lose at least
two or three profiteroles.

27:23.880 --> 27:27.181
Nate, you need to get
all that dough, everything.

27:27.217 --> 27:28.449
I know!

27:28.485 --> 27:30.029
Addison, what can you see
from up there?

27:30.053 --> 27:32.720
It looks like Nate doesn't have
enough of his dough.

27:32.756 --> 27:35.757
He might have to make
a very small croquembouche.

27:35.792 --> 27:36.924
Yeah, I agree.

27:36.960 --> 27:40.061
Got it.

27:40.096 --> 27:41.863
60 minutes to go!

27:41.898 --> 27:45.266
Everybody's profiteroles
should be in the oven now.

27:45.301 --> 27:46.434
Come on, guys.

27:47.971 --> 27:49.937
Come on, Amaya, you can do it!

27:49.973 --> 27:51.539
All right, Miss Amaya.

27:51.574 --> 27:52.807
Hello.

27:52.842 --> 27:54.920
All right, so, have you ever
made a croquembouche before?

27:54.944 --> 27:56.077
Yes.

27:56.112 --> 27:57.612
Now, what's the secret,
in your mind,

27:57.647 --> 27:59.414
to a great cream puff?

27:59.449 --> 28:01.616
It has to be
the perfect consistency

28:01.651 --> 28:03.763
and it has to be baked
for the correct amount of time.

28:03.787 --> 28:05.420
That's right.
Good luck, Amaya.

28:05.455 --> 28:06.587
Thank you.

28:08.057 --> 28:09.301
Right, Derek, how are you doing?

28:09.325 --> 28:11.070
- Great, Chef.
- So you're filling them up now?

28:11.094 --> 28:12.059
They're cooked properly,
are they?

28:12.095 --> 28:13.060
Yup.

28:13.096 --> 28:14.328
The secret here...
look...

28:14.364 --> 28:16.898
is to make sure the filling
goes on the inside.

28:16.933 --> 28:19.300
Otherwise, this pastry cream
on the outside

28:19.335 --> 28:22.837
will destroy the caramel and
it will start falling apart.

28:22.872 --> 28:24.016
- Yes, Chef.
- That's why it's called

28:24.040 --> 28:25.139
a filling.

28:25.175 --> 28:26.140
Yes, Chef.

28:26.176 --> 28:27.141
Try to keep it off that shirt.

28:27.177 --> 28:28.142
Yes, Chef.

28:28.178 --> 28:29.477
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

28:31.281 --> 28:33.848
Come on, JJ, let's go!

28:33.883 --> 28:35.049
JJ, how we doing?

28:35.084 --> 28:36.150
I'm doing good.

28:36.186 --> 28:37.385
You are the oldest kid

28:37.420 --> 28:38.786
in "MasterChef Junior"
right now.

28:38.822 --> 28:41.722
12 years old, you're a hunter,
you're from Texas.

28:41.758 --> 28:43.391
Do you ever do desserts
and stuff?

28:43.426 --> 28:46.694
I do brownies, cookies, cakes.

28:46.729 --> 28:48.262
But I mean, you're wearing
camouflage.

28:48.298 --> 28:49.675
You're not doing this
out in the woods.

28:49.699 --> 28:51.132
- I can.
- You can?

28:51.167 --> 28:53.301
Well, I've never tried,
but I'm pretty sure I can.

28:53.336 --> 28:54.535
Well, best of luck.

28:54.571 --> 28:57.905
20 minutes to go.

28:57.941 --> 29:01.342
By now you should all be
filling your profiteroles

29:01.377 --> 29:04.479
and getting ready to assemble
your croquembouche.

29:04.514 --> 29:07.114
What's burning in here?
You gotta be kidding me!

29:07.150 --> 29:08.115
What's wrong, Ian?

29:08.151 --> 29:09.283
Oh, gosh.

29:09.319 --> 29:10.585
Oh, no!

29:10.620 --> 29:13.721
Ian, your caramel's on fire.
Don't pull it.

29:13.756 --> 29:15.490
It's just the hottest.

29:15.525 --> 29:16.958
That's too hot.

29:16.993 --> 29:17.959
Oh, my God.

29:17.994 --> 29:19.227
Stand back, please.
Stand back.

29:20.263 --> 29:22.263
That looks really burnt,

29:22.298 --> 29:26.534
and when caramel burns, it turns
to a very bitter, bitter taste.

29:28.872 --> 29:30.671
Look at the color of that.

29:30.707 --> 29:33.541
Oh, my God, I can't watch.

29:33.576 --> 29:35.376
Ugh!

29:42.482 --> 29:45.383
That looks really burnt.

29:45.418 --> 29:48.086
Get another pan on
and start again, please.

29:48.121 --> 29:50.221
Come on, you've still got time.

29:50.257 --> 29:51.589
I can't watch.

29:51.625 --> 29:53.358
- Oh, dear.
- What's going on over there?

29:53.393 --> 29:55.660
Okay, Ian is in disarray.

29:55.695 --> 29:57.161
His caramel is burnt.

29:57.197 --> 29:58.663
Ugh!

29:58.698 --> 30:00.598
He has to start that again.

30:00.634 --> 30:02.634
I have enough time,
I have enough time.

30:02.669 --> 30:04.936
Eight minutes to go.

30:04.971 --> 30:09.574
You should now start assembling
your croquembouche.

30:12.512 --> 30:14.345
It smells delicious, guys.

30:14.381 --> 30:16.314
Watch your fingers, guys,
on this caramel.

30:16.349 --> 30:18.616
Please be very, very careful.

30:18.652 --> 30:19.829
- Good job, Ian!
- Come on, Ian!

30:19.853 --> 30:21.352
Whoo!

30:21.388 --> 30:22.687
60 seconds to go, guys.

30:22.722 --> 30:24.088
Come on!

30:24.124 --> 30:26.190
Nate's not gonna have enough.

30:26.226 --> 30:27.659
Nate, you need one more.

30:27.694 --> 30:29.861
Nate, have you
run out of profiteroles?

30:29.896 --> 30:30.896
Yes.

30:32.065 --> 30:33.142
Nate, don't worry.
It looks just fine.

30:33.166 --> 30:34.866
I'm sure they taste amazing.

30:34.901 --> 30:36.434
Finishing touches, let's go.

30:36.469 --> 30:37.969
Come on, guys!

30:38.004 --> 30:39.337
Last ten!

30:39.372 --> 30:44.375
Nine, eight, seven, six, five,

30:44.411 --> 30:47.845
four, three, two, one.

30:47.881 --> 30:50.348
And stop!
Hands in the air, well done.

30:50.383 --> 30:52.150
Whoo!

30:52.185 --> 30:54.252
- Brilliant!
- Whoo-hoo!

30:54.287 --> 30:58.189
Now it's time for all of us
to taste your croquembouche

30:58.224 --> 31:02.727
and then decide which of you
deserve to keep their place

31:02.762 --> 31:04.996
in the biggest
cooking competition

31:05.031 --> 31:06.698
anywhere in the world.

31:06.733 --> 31:08.833
First up, Sam.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.234
Whoo! Come on, Sam.

31:10.270 --> 31:11.636
- Sam.
- Come on, Sam. Go, Sam.

31:11.671 --> 31:14.172
I feel really confident
about my croquembouche.

31:14.207 --> 31:15.673
It looks really good.

31:15.709 --> 31:17.375
I just hope the taste is okay.

31:17.410 --> 31:22.246
All right, Sam, what is your
history with a croquembouche?

31:22.282 --> 31:23.559
I've never made a croquembouche.

31:23.583 --> 31:25.550
You've never made
a croquembouche before?

31:25.585 --> 31:27.418
- Nope.
- And this is what you made

31:27.454 --> 31:28.953
on your first try?

31:28.988 --> 31:29.954
Yup.

31:29.989 --> 31:33.224
If a new pastry cook at Milk Bar

31:33.259 --> 31:35.993
brought me this
on their first day at work,

31:36.029 --> 31:38.062
I would give them
a raise immediately

31:38.098 --> 31:39.764
and beg them to never leave.

31:39.799 --> 31:40.865
You want a job?

31:40.900 --> 31:42.500
I don't know about baking
as a job.

31:42.535 --> 31:43.568
You don't know about...

31:45.505 --> 31:47.839
I just...
I'm a little speechless

31:47.874 --> 31:50.975
that this is your first-ever
croquembouche.

31:52.078 --> 31:53.878
This is just stunning.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.446
You can hear...

31:55.482 --> 31:57.682
it's that hollow cream puff
that you can hear

31:57.717 --> 31:59.228
has been filled
with that pastry cream.

31:59.252 --> 32:02.787
That's a great sign for you,
Sam.

32:02.822 --> 32:03.988
And look at that.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.557
It's perfectly filled
with pastry cream.

32:06.593 --> 32:09.627
You have that caramel crunch
on the bottom.

32:09.662 --> 32:11.729
Beautiful.

32:11.765 --> 32:12.765
Mmm.

32:12.799 --> 32:14.432
Your pastry cream is delicious.

32:14.467 --> 32:17.935
Perfect ration of pastry cream
to pÃ¢te Ã choux.

32:17.971 --> 32:19.871
Picture perfect croquembouche.

32:19.906 --> 32:20.986
Thank you.
Well done, Sam.

32:22.542 --> 32:24.153
I'm not sure if I want
to bake for a living,

32:24.177 --> 32:26.511
but that's so awesome
that Christina would hire me.

32:26.546 --> 32:29.781
I definitely think that I did
enough to be in the top tonight.

32:29.816 --> 32:32.116
Next up, Nate.

32:33.486 --> 32:34.685
Come on, Nate.
Come on, Nate.

32:34.721 --> 32:37.955
- Nate, you got this, man.
- Whoo! Got this, buddy.

32:37.991 --> 32:42.026
It doesn't look like the one
that we presented.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.695
You looked like you were
pretty stressed out.

32:44.731 --> 32:46.531
I was.
This is probably

32:46.566 --> 32:47.943
one of the hardest things
I've ever done,

32:47.967 --> 32:51.402
but I just hope you like it.

32:53.039 --> 32:55.606
Our caramel is...
it's burned, and it's too much.

32:55.642 --> 32:57.675
It should be almost
like a slight give

32:57.710 --> 32:58.843
to hold 'em together.

32:58.878 --> 33:00.645
I don't want to be eating
big shards.

33:00.680 --> 33:02.013
Yes.

33:02.048 --> 33:06.083
The pastry itself is sadly
still wet and undercooked,

33:06.119 --> 33:08.453
and then there's just not
that much filling at all.

33:12.325 --> 33:15.626
The sad part is that
the flavor on the pastry cream

33:15.662 --> 33:17.328
is delicious,
it's perfectly seasoned,

33:17.363 --> 33:19.964
but obviously,
not enough of 'em.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.032
No.

33:21.067 --> 33:22.533
Not the height,
not enough filling.

33:22.569 --> 33:25.570
It's a super hard challenge, and
you have a lot of highs in here,

33:25.605 --> 33:27.772
but there are a lot of lows.

33:27.807 --> 33:33.010
- Okay? Thank you.
- Thanks.

33:33.046 --> 33:35.847
Next up, Jesse, please.
Let's go.

33:35.882 --> 33:38.049
Come on, Jesse!

33:39.819 --> 33:43.488
Visually, you have the perfect
shape of profiteroles.

33:43.523 --> 33:45.790
They're cooked beautifully,
they're crisp on the outside.

33:47.093 --> 33:49.293
You were nearly hitting
perfection,

33:49.329 --> 33:51.629
but the caramel is way too dark.

33:51.664 --> 33:52.830
- Okay.
- Good job.

33:52.866 --> 33:54.131
Thank you.

33:54.167 --> 33:55.600
Come on up, JJ.

33:57.337 --> 33:59.270
Bonjour, Monsieur.

33:59.305 --> 34:02.306
It is the leaning tower
of croquembouche.

34:03.543 --> 34:05.810
Mmm.
This is delicious.

34:05.845 --> 34:07.445
Construction needs work.

34:07.480 --> 34:10.014
Caramel, just the right color,
you definitely nailed that,

34:10.049 --> 34:12.149
and the pastry cream is
out of this world.

34:12.185 --> 34:13.484
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.753
Next, please, we'd like Avery.

34:19.391 --> 34:22.126
When's the last time
you ate a croquembouche

34:22.161 --> 34:23.127
back in Louisiana?

34:23.161 --> 34:24.161
Never.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.601
Visually, the shape
is not right,

34:30.637 --> 34:33.371
but you make up for that
by having

34:33.406 --> 34:36.706
one of the tastiest profiteroles
that I think we had tonight.

34:36.743 --> 34:38.342
Good job, thank you.

34:38.378 --> 34:40.777
Good job, Avery!

34:40.813 --> 34:42.746
Next up, Derek, please,
let's go.

34:44.717 --> 34:47.284
Nice and carefully.

34:47.320 --> 34:48.898
How long did you cook
your profiteroles for?

34:48.922 --> 34:50.688
I cooked them for 24 minutes.

34:50.723 --> 34:51.822
Did you test one?

34:51.858 --> 34:52.822
No.

34:52.859 --> 34:55.293
So inside, this is all wet here.

34:55.328 --> 34:56.994
What do you think
that dampness means?

34:57.030 --> 34:58.107
It wasn't cooked all the way.

34:58.131 --> 34:59.964
It's exactly that.

35:02.936 --> 35:04.769
Tonight's challenge is
all about perfection.

35:04.804 --> 35:06.771
I think you worked messy.

35:06.806 --> 35:08.906
It's almost like you
treated it as a race.

35:08.942 --> 35:12.443
Sadly, your profiteroles
are undercooked.

35:12.478 --> 35:15.079
The color of your cream puffs
are beautiful,

35:15.114 --> 35:17.048
but you've got to check
the inside.

35:18.084 --> 35:19.483
Thank you.

35:22.422 --> 35:24.255
Next up, Amaya.

35:25.725 --> 35:26.824
Whoo!

35:29.896 --> 35:32.463
Visually, you chose
to take the croquembouches

35:32.498 --> 35:35.066
and you sort of layered them
bottom to bottom to bottom.

35:35.101 --> 35:36.767
Typically, when you do
a croquembouche,

35:36.803 --> 35:38.436
you start to build up the sides

35:38.471 --> 35:40.938
so that the puff
of the cream puff is facing out,

35:40.974 --> 35:43.474
rather than being covered up.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.476
I think your cream puffs
definitely could've used

35:45.511 --> 35:46.978
a little bit more time
in the oven

35:47.013 --> 35:49.614
so that they hollowed out
a little bit better.

35:52.151 --> 35:55.052
Very tasty, balance of flavor
in your cream puff.

35:55.088 --> 35:57.655
Pastry cream itself is also
really delicious.

35:57.690 --> 36:00.625
I think the concerns are just
the shape, size, technique,

36:00.660 --> 36:02.193
and cook time
of those cream puffs,

36:02.228 --> 36:04.729
but really great effort.

36:04.764 --> 36:06.230
- Whoo!
- Great job, Amaya.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.198
Great job, Amaya.

36:07.233 --> 36:08.633
You did a great job.

36:08.668 --> 36:10.935
Next up, Ian, let's go.

36:10.970 --> 36:12.903
- Whoo-hoo, yeah.
- Come on, Ian.

36:12.939 --> 36:16.107
I look at my croquembouche.
I'm not too happy about it.

36:16.142 --> 36:18.509
My profiteroles are
really ugly...

36:18.544 --> 36:21.178
they are... but I hope
they taste really good,

36:21.214 --> 36:23.881
'cause I do not want to go home.

36:23.916 --> 36:27.084
Okay.

36:27.120 --> 36:28.252
So visually, that looks

36:28.287 --> 36:31.555
a little bit like
a "croquem-mess."

36:31.591 --> 36:32.623
Did you sit on it?

36:32.659 --> 36:33.724
No.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.660
Let's talk about the shapes.

36:35.695 --> 36:37.595
I seem to have a gerbil.

36:37.630 --> 36:38.630
Oh, my God.

36:38.665 --> 36:41.132
I seem to have
a drowned rat here.

36:42.402 --> 36:45.870
And this one here looks
like a squashed frog.

36:45.905 --> 36:48.272
They would hang you
from the Eiffel Tower in Paris

36:48.307 --> 36:50.374
if you called that
a profiterole.

36:52.979 --> 36:54.745
Oh, my God.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.300
Let's talk about the shapes.

37:02.336 --> 37:04.469
I seem to have a gerbil.

37:04.505 --> 37:05.505
Oh, my God.

37:05.539 --> 37:07.606
I seem to have
a drowned rat here.

37:08.642 --> 37:10.041
And this one here, what is that?

37:10.077 --> 37:12.110
What is it, like, a sparrow?

37:12.146 --> 37:14.513
They would hang you
from the Eiffel Tower in Paris

37:14.548 --> 37:16.848
if you called that
a profiterole.

37:16.884 --> 37:22.854
But, as you know,
it's all about the taste.

37:23.957 --> 37:25.223
Love this hard top on here.

37:25.259 --> 37:26.491
Thank you.

37:26.527 --> 37:28.527
Love that. That means
they're cooked properly.

37:28.562 --> 37:31.496
Sufficient cream?

37:31.532 --> 37:33.131
Yes.

37:36.236 --> 37:38.436
Here's the thing.

37:38.472 --> 37:41.673
Are they the best?
Definitely not.

37:41.708 --> 37:43.408
Are they in the bottom?

37:43.443 --> 37:44.676
Yes, they are.

37:46.380 --> 37:47.445
Thank you.

37:49.449 --> 37:50.849
Good job, bud.

37:50.884 --> 37:53.585
My croquembouche looked
really ugly,

37:53.620 --> 37:55.954
but at least it tasted good.

37:58.425 --> 38:01.760
Right, could all eight of you
please make your way down here?

38:08.302 --> 38:11.136
This was a very intense
pressure test.

38:11.171 --> 38:13.905
That was a very tall order.

38:13.941 --> 38:16.041
Please, all of you,
give us a moment,

38:16.076 --> 38:19.144
because we need to
discuss this at length.

38:22.115 --> 38:23.882
I'm going home.
I swear to God.

38:23.917 --> 38:25.784
Don't say that, Ian.

38:25.819 --> 38:27.719
Um, a technical dish
to pull off.

38:27.754 --> 38:29.221
Full of technique and skill.

38:29.256 --> 38:30.266
Some of 'em did great though,
right?

38:30.290 --> 38:32.057
I think mine was undercooked,

38:32.092 --> 38:34.359
but the pastry treat was great,
they liked that.

38:34.394 --> 38:35.360
It was missing half, though.

38:35.395 --> 38:36.628
- I mean...
- Yeah.

38:36.663 --> 38:39.197
You had a soggy, squashy pastry
needing more sugar.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.243
Dude, Derek, you all right, bud?

38:40.267 --> 38:41.267
Yeah.

38:41.301 --> 38:43.068
You can't put
so much pastry cream in

38:43.103 --> 38:45.370
that it starts coming out
of every top and side.

38:45.405 --> 38:47.050
Looks like somebody already
ate it and put it back.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.206
Yeah, yeah.

38:48.242 --> 38:49.574
16 people.
Who do you think it is?

38:49.610 --> 38:51.443
I don't know.

38:54.748 --> 38:58.984
Tonight was a very,
very tough challenge.

38:59.019 --> 39:04.289
One home cook did
a pretty extraordinary job,

39:04.324 --> 39:07.759
and not only is this home cook
just ten years old...

39:07.794 --> 39:09.060
It's you, buddy.

39:09.096 --> 39:11.329
They don't even want to be
a pastry chef,

39:11.365 --> 39:12.797
which I find quite offensive.

39:14.534 --> 39:16.334
Please step forward, Sam.

39:19.840 --> 39:23.074
Sam, that was brilliant.

39:23.110 --> 39:24.409
Congratulations,

39:24.444 --> 39:27.679
you are going nowhere
except for up to the balcony.

39:27.714 --> 39:28.813
Well done, buddy.

39:31.351 --> 39:33.752
It's amazing that I did
the best croquembouche,

39:33.787 --> 39:35.720
and I've never even
made one before.

39:35.756 --> 39:37.289
Great job, Sam.

39:37.324 --> 39:40.492
All right, Christina,
maybe I'll take the job.

39:41.695 --> 39:44.729
There were three other
young home cooks

39:44.765 --> 39:48.366
that did a pretty awesome job
tonight.

39:48.402 --> 39:51.202
Please step forward,

39:51.238 --> 39:53.672
Avery,

39:53.707 --> 39:56.007
Jesse,

39:56.043 --> 39:57.142
and JJ.

39:59.479 --> 40:01.279
You are all safe.
Please head to the balcony.

40:07.621 --> 40:11.022
Right, that leaves just four
of you talented youngsters.

40:11.058 --> 40:12.724
Two of you will be staying

40:12.759 --> 40:15.760
and two of you, sadly,
will have to leave.

40:18.298 --> 40:22.600
Christina, Graham, and I know
how difficult that task was,

40:22.636 --> 40:25.270
so whatever happens,
whatever the result,

40:25.305 --> 40:29.841
well done, all four of you.

40:29.876 --> 40:32.610
Ian and Amaya,
step forward, please.

40:34.348 --> 40:36.281
Oh, my God.

40:36.316 --> 40:41.052
You two... didn't have
a great night.

40:43.023 --> 40:45.523
But they weren't the worst.

40:46.560 --> 40:48.693
Please, both of you,
head upstairs.

40:48.729 --> 40:50.328
Nate's leaving.

40:50.364 --> 40:51.663
What? No, no.

40:52.899 --> 40:54.866
I'll miss you guys.

41:00.073 --> 41:04.209
Nate, Derek,
remember that you beat

41:04.244 --> 41:07.412
thousands and thousands
of other youngsters

41:07.447 --> 41:09.881
to get where you are
standing tonight.

41:09.916 --> 41:13.918
Top 16 is a big achievement.
Never forget that,

41:13.954 --> 41:19.691
and do not let those
culinary dreams disappear.

41:20.727 --> 41:21.893
Come here.

41:23.430 --> 41:26.631
Well done, bud.
Good job. Well done.

41:26.666 --> 41:28.066
I'm sad that I got eliminated,

41:28.101 --> 41:30.935
but I'm proud that I made it
to the top 16.

41:30.971 --> 41:32.437
The hardest part for me
is probably

41:32.472 --> 41:33.992
leaving all the friends
I've made here.

41:37.778 --> 41:40.478
But everything I learned here
in the MasterChef kitchen

41:40.514 --> 41:43.848
I'm gonna take home
and become a better chef.

41:43.884 --> 41:46.017
This is the greatest experience
of my life

41:46.053 --> 41:47.752
and I'll never forget
my time here.

41:47.788 --> 41:49.521
I mean, I got to cook
moon cheese.

41:49.556 --> 41:52.290
I got to filet and cook
a giant yellowfin tuna.

41:52.325 --> 41:54.392
I got marshmallow shot on me.

41:54.428 --> 41:56.361
There's nothing better
I could ask for.

41:56.396 --> 41:59.130
We'll miss you!

41:59.166 --> 42:00.832
Sure, I didn't get
the MasterChef trophy,

42:00.867 --> 42:05.070
but I get to see
my little brother and sister.

42:05.105 --> 42:06.704
It's just awesome.

42:11.144 --> 42:12.410
Next week...

42:12.446 --> 42:13.446
Lemonade, yeah!

42:13.480 --> 42:15.246
Lemonade is my thing.

42:15.282 --> 42:16.314
A juicy challenge...

42:16.349 --> 42:17.982
Hurry!

42:18.018 --> 42:19.629
Puts the squeeze
on the junior home cooks.

42:19.653 --> 42:21.586
The team that makes
the best lemonade

42:21.621 --> 42:23.655
will stay nice and dry.

42:25.258 --> 42:26.291
And then...

42:26.326 --> 42:27.292
Oh, my God!

42:27.327 --> 42:28.593
Groovy, baby.

42:28.628 --> 42:30.462
Things turn really sour...

42:30.542 --> 42:34.062
What the heck? She wears
underwear outside her pants!

42:34.335 --> 42:38.208
When the judges take
a trip down memory lane.

42:40.073 --> 42:43.129
I'm totally fine.
