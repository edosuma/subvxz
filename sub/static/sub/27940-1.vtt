WEBVTT

01:30.208 --> 01:32.642
I don't understand it.

01:32.666 --> 01:34.892
Nothing on here
indicates land for miles.

01:34.916 --> 01:37.059
What could we possibly have hit?

01:37.083 --> 01:39.017
Has it occurred to you

01:39.041 --> 01:41.226
that we're not where
you thought we were?

01:41.250 --> 01:43.476
It doesn't make any sense.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.226
Well, you're reading it wrong, sir.
Jim.

01:45.250 --> 01:46.476
What?

01:46.500 --> 01:47.892
The man's an idiot!

01:47.916 --> 01:49.934
He can't even read
a chart properly.

02:02.875 --> 02:06.250
Well, I don't know what he's
done what that. Jim, enough!

02:07.916 --> 02:11.226
It's all right, Ferris.

02:11.250 --> 02:14.017
I don't know where we are.

02:25.208 --> 02:27.125
Land!

02:29.041 --> 02:31.041
Land!

02:37.208 --> 02:39.892
Row, Bickley!

02:39.916 --> 02:41.875
Row! Row, man!

03:45.291 --> 03:48.351
We need to get you warm, sir.

03:48.375 --> 03:52.166
I could... try
and get a fire started.

03:54.708 --> 03:56.333
I'll give you a hand.

04:23.666 --> 04:25.541
Useless anyway.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.351
We'll be lucky if this works.
It's all pretty damp.

04:31.375 --> 04:33.791
But it's worth a shot.

04:38.458 --> 04:40.726
I can try and find some flint.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.476
Good idea, Cailean.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.476
I'll go and see
if I can find any shelter.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.517
We should stay together. We don't
know what's on this island.

04:47.541 --> 04:49.559
Come off it, man!

04:49.583 --> 04:51.434
Surely you couldn't
have got us so lost

04:51.458 --> 04:53.892
that we're somewhere
off the East Indies?

04:53.916 --> 04:58.142
I'm sure I can handle myself if I come
across a primitive Highland Pict.

04:58.166 --> 04:59.476
Jesus!

04:59.500 --> 05:01.934
Good morning, gentlemen.

05:01.958 --> 05:03.767
Morning!

05:03.791 --> 05:05.559
I'm Fingal MacLeod.

05:05.583 --> 05:07.517
Welcome to the island.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.517
We're extremely relieved to make
your acquaintance, Mr. MacLeod.

05:10.541 --> 05:14.267
Our ship sank in the mist, and our
row boat barely made it here.

05:14.291 --> 05:17.351
Might I presume that we're somewhere
off the west coast of Scotland?

05:17.375 --> 05:19.166
Thereabouts, aye.

05:21.250 --> 05:24.309
Well, looks like you could all
do with a restorative, hmm?

05:24.333 --> 05:25.892
Follow me.

05:25.916 --> 05:28.559
Our ship hit some rocks
not far from here.

05:28.583 --> 05:30.476
There may be some survivors.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.017
Perhaps if we built a fire,

05:32.041 --> 05:34.333
they might be able
to follow it to shore.

05:36.208 --> 05:37.726
I'll tell you what.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.559
You come and dry
yourselves at my cottage,

05:39.583 --> 05:41.601
and I'll come back
and light a fire.

05:41.625 --> 05:43.476
We'll make sure
if there's anyone out there,

05:43.500 --> 05:46.101
they'll know where to swim to.

05:46.125 --> 05:48.976
We do need to get you warm, sir,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.041
and take a look at your arm.

06:19.375 --> 06:21.351
There we go.

06:21.375 --> 06:24.416
Have your fill.
There's plenty more.

06:26.250 --> 06:29.059
We haven't much here,
but porridge we have.

06:29.083 --> 06:30.708
We're very grateful, sir.

06:36.583 --> 06:38.583
Bickley, have you the, um...

06:45.000 --> 06:47.309
Where'd you get this?

06:47.333 --> 06:50.559
We managed to salvage a little from
the ship before she went down.

06:50.583 --> 06:52.208
Thank you kindly.

06:54.291 --> 06:56.000
Now, eat.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.934
So tell me,
where are you from? Navy?

07:02.958 --> 07:04.559
Merchant.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.458
So you're on your own.

07:09.416 --> 07:11.309
Where were you headed?
New York,

07:11.333 --> 07:13.934
where I still intend to go.

07:13.958 --> 07:16.184
The land of opportunity.

07:16.208 --> 07:19.059
You certainly can't say that about
this place. Where are we exactly?

07:19.083 --> 07:20.958
Do you know
what happened out there?

07:22.375 --> 07:23.934
We got lost.

07:23.958 --> 07:25.726
Quite spectacularly.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.976
This island isn't on
any of the charts we had.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.642
No.
And then the mist came in.

07:30.666 --> 07:32.809
We couldn't see a thing
except a light in the distance.

07:32.833 --> 07:34.684
A light?

07:34.708 --> 07:37.767
Yes. It seemed a long way
off, so we carried on.

07:37.791 --> 07:41.101
Even though the first mate said we should
stop. It was the captain's decision.

07:41.125 --> 07:43.726
We ran aground, the ship sank,
and you're still defending him!

07:43.750 --> 07:46.333
That's enough, sailor!
Gentlemen.

07:51.041 --> 07:53.851
My apologies,
Mr. MacLeod.

07:53.875 --> 07:56.041
We've been through
quite the ordeal.

08:01.375 --> 08:04.101
Now, we need to get
that wound seen to.

08:04.125 --> 08:05.684
There's a farm a little way off.

08:05.708 --> 08:08.101
We'll get Lanthe Innis
to take a look at it.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.476
Thank you, sir, but perhaps we could
organize that fire on the beach first?

08:10.500 --> 08:12.392
Finish up.
I'll see to it now,

08:12.416 --> 08:14.017
and then we'll head to the farm.

08:14.041 --> 08:16.101
They'll have space
for you all to stay there

08:16.125 --> 08:18.184
until we can work out a way to
get you back to the mainland.

08:18.208 --> 08:20.642
I'll help you with the fire, sir.
No, lad.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.517
You rest,
get your strength back.

08:22.541 --> 08:25.642
When is the next boat
to the mainland, Mr. MacLeod?

08:41.832 --> 08:43.933
They're coming, Lanthe.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.559
What? Who are?

08:45.583 --> 08:47.708
Three of them.
Survivors.

08:51.166 --> 08:52.851
Wait. How?

08:52.875 --> 08:55.291
I don't know, but they're here.
And they can help us.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.559
Where are they now?

08:59.583 --> 09:01.267
MacLeod got to them first.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.833
Lanthe!

09:42.791 --> 09:44.916
Hmm.
What, sir?

09:46.083 --> 09:48.726
Nothing.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.333
Just that our host has
excellent taste in literature.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.791
September 22, 1841.

10:23.041 --> 10:26.601
Stop! Stop!
Turn back!

10:26.625 --> 10:28.851
It's happened again.

10:28.875 --> 10:31.809
Another ship has broken
upon the rocks.

10:31.833 --> 10:34.309
You're headed towards the rocks!

10:34.333 --> 10:37.226
I tried to help them,
but they couldn't hear me.

10:37.250 --> 10:40.517
That awful, deafening sound.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.726
Right that's done.

10:45.750 --> 10:47.250
All set then?

10:55.333 --> 10:57.351
How many people
are on the island, Mr. MacLeod?

10:57.375 --> 10:59.809
"Fingal," please.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.642
It's been a tough few years.

11:01.666 --> 11:03.976
The food plight
of '41 devastated

11:04.000 --> 11:07.559
what was once very fertile land.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.892
Most have moved on now.

11:10.916 --> 11:13.684
You mentioned earlier about
getting us back to the mainland.

11:13.708 --> 11:15.851
Is there a regular crossing?

11:15.875 --> 11:18.809
I wouldn't say it was
particularly regular, no.

11:18.833 --> 11:21.101
I see. So...
All in good time.

11:21.125 --> 11:22.684
Leave them be, old man!

11:22.708 --> 11:25.125
You can't keep them
for yourself.

11:28.583 --> 11:30.476
You've come back for me!

11:30.500 --> 11:32.375
You leave them be, Korrigan!

11:33.666 --> 11:36.000
Leave! Leave now.
You mustn't be here.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.791
Go home.

11:42.041 --> 11:43.958
Careful, Fingal.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.267
Sorry about that.
Ignore her.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.851
Just the ravings of a mad woman.

11:54.875 --> 11:58.017
Her brother was taken
by the sea a few years back.

11:58.041 --> 12:00.726
She's never quite recovered.

12:00.750 --> 12:02.500
Let's press on.

12:11.083 --> 12:13.708
She certainly took
a liking to you, Jim.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.458
Can you blame her?

12:47.416 --> 12:48.750
Douglas?

12:50.583 --> 12:52.708
I've some guests for you.

13:08.291 --> 13:10.476
Their brig hit upon
some trouble.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.934
These poor fellows were the only
ones that managed to survive.

13:13.958 --> 13:16.125
I thought they could
stay with you.

13:17.541 --> 13:19.517
No.
I don't think so.

13:19.541 --> 13:25.059
Master Gosling here is in a
pretty bad way, Douglas.

13:25.083 --> 13:27.392
Perhaps your Lanthe might be
able to take a look at him.

13:27.416 --> 13:30.750
They can't stay here, Fingal.
Lanthe's not been well.

13:31.833 --> 13:33.767
They managed to salvage a few

13:33.791 --> 13:35.916
interesting supplies, Douglas.

13:38.541 --> 13:41.601
Rum.
Pleased to meet you, sir.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.892
I'm Midshipman Oliver Gosling,
and these gentlemen

13:43.916 --> 13:46.125
are Able Seamen Jim Bickley
and Cailean Ferris.

13:51.416 --> 13:54.041
Rum, sir.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.267
You'll have to forgive Douglas.

13:59.291 --> 14:01.416
We don't have
many visitors these days.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.476
Thank you, MacLeod.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.226
Aye, well, I'll be off then.

14:07.250 --> 14:10.226
I'll let you know if we have any
luck with that fire of yours.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.226
Thank you for your kindness, Mr. MacLeod.
And that boat you mentioned?

14:13.250 --> 14:15.351
The boat?

14:15.375 --> 14:17.684
To the mainland.
Oh, yes.

14:17.708 --> 14:19.934
MacLeod...

14:19.958 --> 14:21.666
Good day.

14:25.166 --> 14:27.142
You'd better
sit yourselves down.

14:31.625 --> 14:35.059
I'll go make the room up for the young
officer, get blankets for the other two.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.642
He is not staying
in William's room.

14:37.666 --> 14:39.267
They can all sleep down here.

14:39.291 --> 14:41.976
Uncle, he's wounded.
He needs a proper bed.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.726
Aye, well, you get
yourself back upstairs

14:44.750 --> 14:47.208
soon as you've tended
to him, hmm?

15:11.916 --> 15:13.767
So how many were aboard?

15:13.791 --> 15:16.642
Sixteen.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.642
And you were the only survivors?
We couldn't see.

15:19.666 --> 15:22.101
It was thick with fog.

15:22.125 --> 15:25.142
Couldn't even see
a yard in front of you.

15:25.166 --> 15:26.666
Just hear the screaming.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.333
Sorry.

15:34.791 --> 15:36.559
It was chaos.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.500
I didn't know
what was happening.

15:40.333 --> 15:43.333
But I thought I heard singing.

15:51.708 --> 15:53.166
Excuse me.

15:57.208 --> 15:58.642
I'm sorry.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.583
Was it something I said?

16:02.208 --> 16:03.976
You're all right.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.791
It's not you.

16:07.625 --> 16:09.125
Rum.

16:21.250 --> 16:24.809
A few years ago now,

16:24.833 --> 16:27.541
one of our fishing boats sank.

16:29.625 --> 16:32.125
All the young men were drowned.

16:36.791 --> 16:39.458
It hit this wee community hard.

16:43.041 --> 16:44.416
Good night.

16:51.375 --> 16:54.458
There's something
really weird going on here.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.500
Pull yourself together.

18:55.875 --> 18:57.583
Guide us home, eh?

19:08.875 --> 19:11.041
Jacob!

21:05.083 --> 21:06.559
Bickley.

21:06.583 --> 21:08.726
Sir.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.500
Did you sleep?

21:11.708 --> 21:13.166
Some.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.208
How's the arm?

21:17.541 --> 21:19.226
Good, thank you.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.476
Morning, sir.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.726
Goodness, Bickley,
you look awful.

21:25.166 --> 21:27.083
Thanks, Ferris.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.166
Gentlemen,

21:32.166 --> 21:35.517
I think we should have a look to see if
we can get off this island ourselves.

21:35.541 --> 21:38.601
Why, sir? Didn't Fingal say he was
going to help us with a boat?

21:38.625 --> 21:42.166
No, you're right, sir. We
should have a look ourselves.

21:43.416 --> 21:45.351
We don't want to
burden these people

21:45.375 --> 21:47.000
any longer than we have to.

21:48.083 --> 21:49.976
We can see who else is
on the island,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.517
bargain some rum
for a decent boat, but...

21:53.541 --> 21:56.601
let's not mention
anything to our hosts.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.166
Agreed?

21:59.583 --> 22:02.226
Good morning.
I hope you all slept well.

22:02.250 --> 22:04.392
Perfectly, thank you, Lanthe.

22:04.416 --> 22:06.434
I trust your arm's feeling
better, Mr. Gosling?

22:06.458 --> 22:10.017
"Oliver," please.
And yes.

22:10.041 --> 22:12.684
Yes, much better, thank you.
Remarkably so, in fact.

22:12.708 --> 22:15.916
Good. I'm glad. I'll make a
start on breakfast then.

22:18.083 --> 22:22.125
We were thinking of
exploring the island today.

22:23.416 --> 22:24.726
Why?

22:24.750 --> 22:26.726
Stretch our legs,
get some fresh air,

22:26.750 --> 22:28.726
see what your lovely
home has to offer.

22:28.750 --> 22:30.833
There's nothing out there.
Not anymore.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.976
Still...
You should stay inside, Oliver.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.267
Get your rest.
You won't heal if you don't.

22:37.291 --> 22:39.809
Let the others go if they must.

22:39.833 --> 22:43.000
We can report back anything we find, and you
can take a look when you're feeling stronger.

22:44.875 --> 22:48.809
Very well.
Thank you, Bickley.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.666
You can tell me about your home.

22:52.041 --> 22:54.517
What's this?
Mr. Bickley and Mr. Ferris

22:54.541 --> 22:56.476
were going to have
a wee look around the island,

22:56.500 --> 22:59.226
but I told Mr. Gosling
he should stay here and rest.

22:59.250 --> 23:00.726
There's nothing
for you out there.

23:00.750 --> 23:02.476
Just thought
we'd take the opportunity

23:02.500 --> 23:04.226
of having an explore,
that's all.

23:04.250 --> 23:08.267
There's nothing
for you to explore.

23:08.291 --> 23:10.434
This is a dead isle.

23:10.458 --> 23:14.142
We're only here
'cause we've no choice.

23:14.166 --> 23:16.267
Besides,

23:16.291 --> 23:18.184
there's a storm coming.

23:18.208 --> 23:20.041
We'll wrap up warm.

23:23.791 --> 23:25.458
Suit yourselves.

23:32.958 --> 23:35.458
I'll make a start
on the porridge then.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.791
It's a good job I like porridge.

24:16.041 --> 24:18.684
I can't find anything.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.583
I'm looking, I am.

24:33.666 --> 24:35.767
No.

24:35.791 --> 24:38.625
No, I don't want to.
Not this one.

24:40.375 --> 24:42.041
Yes.

24:43.666 --> 24:46.000
Yes, of course I know they did.

24:48.916 --> 24:50.250
Aye.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.625
Anything?

25:05.625 --> 25:08.226
No.
It's completely empty.

25:08.250 --> 25:09.916
Another one.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.166
What on earth happened here?

26:29.500 --> 26:31.392
Douglas was right.

26:31.416 --> 26:32.809
There's nothing here.

26:32.833 --> 26:34.976
The place is dead.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.059
What do you think?
Go back?

26:37.083 --> 26:41.059
There must be an old
boat or something here.

26:41.083 --> 26:42.892
Where did they all go?

26:42.916 --> 26:45.750
Why are you so desperate to leave?
Because...

26:47.750 --> 26:50.559
Because there are only four people on
this island, and they're all weird.

26:50.583 --> 26:52.958
You'd be a weird too
if you lived here too long.

26:54.041 --> 26:56.416
They've been kind to us so far.

26:57.708 --> 26:59.434
Why did they stay
when everyone else

26:59.458 --> 27:01.642
clearly had the sense to leave?

27:01.666 --> 27:03.476
I suppose they...

27:05.375 --> 27:07.184
Maybe we should go.
Let's split up.

27:07.208 --> 27:08.892
We'll cover
more ground that way,

27:08.916 --> 27:10.392
hopefully find something useful.

27:10.416 --> 27:12.184
Jim, I don't think...
Cailean, just...

27:12.208 --> 27:14.184
Okay.

27:14.208 --> 27:16.750
But if it starts to rain,
I'm going back.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.226
Good lad.

27:20.250 --> 27:22.083
See you in an hour.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.875
What were you talking
to her about?

29:52.916 --> 29:54.476
Nothing.
She just wanted food.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.476
Ah, don't give me that, Lanthe.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.333
What was she doing here?

29:59.625 --> 30:02.892
She's worked herself up
over the sailors.

30:02.916 --> 30:06.017
You must've noticed
the resemblance to Jacob.

30:06.041 --> 30:08.642
Aye. Well, I don't want
you getting worked up.

30:08.666 --> 30:11.125
You stay away from her,
do you hear me?

30:13.125 --> 30:15.125
I'll make a start on supper.

30:47.125 --> 30:49.000
Typical.

30:50.458 --> 30:52.208
Where am I?

31:02.208 --> 31:03.833
Bickley?

31:13.875 --> 31:15.375
Bickley?

31:18.000 --> 31:19.791
Bickley!

31:55.458 --> 31:57.351
He's not in.
Jesus, man!

31:57.375 --> 31:59.851
Oh I'm sorry, laddie.
How can I help?

31:59.875 --> 32:02.291
Oh, I just, uh...

32:04.333 --> 32:05.476
Where is everyone?

32:05.500 --> 32:07.750
We've been all round the island.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.309
What happened?
Oh.

32:12.333 --> 32:14.267
That's a very long story.

32:14.291 --> 32:16.309
And it's time
you got back to the farm.

32:16.333 --> 32:19.375
It gets awful dark awful
quick around these parts.

32:21.583 --> 32:24.184
Fingal, how do we get back
to the mainland?

32:24.208 --> 32:27.458
There must be a...
Oh, I almost forgot. Your matches.

32:29.375 --> 32:31.666
You must have left
them yesterday.

32:33.875 --> 32:36.375
Best get inside
before it gets too dark.

32:38.250 --> 32:39.500
Mind your way.

32:40.833 --> 32:42.458
Yeah.

32:43.458 --> 32:45.250
Thank you.

32:52.250 --> 32:53.916
Bickley?

32:57.458 --> 32:59.166
Gosling?

33:02.083 --> 33:04.000
Bickley!

33:04.791 --> 33:06.708
Somebody!

33:14.833 --> 33:17.726
What have you been doing out there?
Oh!

33:17.750 --> 33:19.892
I just got muddled as to
where I was, that's all.

33:19.916 --> 33:21.559
It gets pretty dark quick.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.809
You shouldn't be out after dark.

33:23.833 --> 33:26.934
It's not safe out there.
There's cliffs and bogs,

33:26.958 --> 33:29.226
rabbit holes
you snap your ankle in,

33:29.250 --> 33:30.916
all sorts of things.

33:32.791 --> 33:34.476
Anything of interest, Bickley?

33:34.500 --> 33:37.267
Uh, no.
The place is deserted.

33:37.291 --> 33:40.375
I told you. There's nothing
for you out there.

33:43.583 --> 33:46.000
Did Ferris find anything?

33:47.083 --> 33:49.000
Is he not with you?

33:50.375 --> 33:51.666
What?

33:52.791 --> 33:54.833
Why weren't you together?

33:55.708 --> 33:57.809
Well, we... Uh, he...

33:57.833 --> 34:00.017
he just wanted to have
a look by himself.

34:00.041 --> 34:02.351
Explore and all that.

34:02.375 --> 34:04.934
I thought he'd be back
by now though.

34:04.958 --> 34:07.226
We need to look for him.
No, no, no, no.

34:07.250 --> 34:08.976
You're not gonna...

34:09.000 --> 34:10.833
Bickley?

34:12.041 --> 34:13.916
Gosling?

34:15.791 --> 34:17.391
Somebody!

34:17.416 --> 34:19.416
Right, Lanthe?
What?

34:22.125 --> 34:23.851
Oh, yes.

34:23.875 --> 34:25.666
He'll be fine.

34:26.500 --> 34:28.184
Excuse me.

34:28.208 --> 34:29.851
I'm sorry.
I just need to...

34:29.875 --> 34:33.250
Miss Innis?
No, it's all right.

34:34.791 --> 34:37.125
She has bad nerves is all.

34:43.666 --> 34:45.101
Stay here.

34:45.125 --> 34:48.291
What you doing?
You should get warm.

34:55.166 --> 34:57.791
Get you away from that window.

35:00.833 --> 35:02.500
Don't touch me!

35:03.291 --> 35:06.166
Come on!
No! No!

35:21.791 --> 35:24.059
Quiet!

35:27.291 --> 35:29.458
Shh!

36:05.875 --> 36:09.101
So if you came
back past Fingal's cottage,

36:09.125 --> 36:12.851
then you must have split up...

36:12.875 --> 36:15.875
somewhere around here, correct?

36:19.708 --> 36:20.767
Bickley!

36:20.791 --> 36:23.184
What?

36:23.208 --> 36:25.726
At first light, we'll set
out along this route

36:25.750 --> 36:28.041
and see if we can
retrace his steps.

36:43.166 --> 36:45.166
Do you hear that?

37:16.291 --> 37:17.833
Cailean.

37:20.333 --> 37:21.708
Ferris?

37:22.833 --> 37:24.142
Ferris?

37:24.166 --> 37:25.851
There's no one there, Bickley.

37:25.875 --> 37:27.875
Oliver?

37:29.041 --> 37:30.642
I didn't see anything.

37:30.666 --> 37:32.291
Cailean?

40:10.833 --> 40:14.767
Another ship
has broken upon the rocks.

40:14.791 --> 40:16.892
This time it was one of ours.

40:16.916 --> 40:20.309
I found the bodies washed up
on the shore this morning.

40:20.333 --> 40:23.476
No. Not "washed up."

40:23.500 --> 40:26.392
It was if they'd
been placed there,

40:26.416 --> 40:29.434
all in a perfect line.

40:29.458 --> 40:31.934
Poor Billy.

40:31.958 --> 40:34.601
He should never have gone out.

40:34.625 --> 40:38.101
He wasn't a fisherman,
but he wanted to help.

40:38.125 --> 40:40.541
We're so desperate for food.

41:01.833 --> 41:03.583
Was this our fault?

41:05.333 --> 41:08.166
I can't help but think
we're being punished.

42:53.625 --> 42:55.250
Oh, no.

43:19.083 --> 43:21.208
Do you think it's Ferris?

43:31.333 --> 43:33.851
He must have fell in the storm.

43:33.875 --> 43:37.476
These cliffs become
treacherous in bad weather.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.726
What do you think
happened to his face?

43:39.750 --> 43:42.791
Probably fell into
all sorts on his way down.

43:49.625 --> 43:52.333
He should be buried at sea.

43:53.250 --> 43:56.142
We need a boat.

43:56.166 --> 43:58.184
Fingal, can we borrow yours?

43:58.208 --> 44:00.666
Don't be ridiculous.
In this storm?

44:02.208 --> 44:04.583
The boat's too small.
It's far too dangerous.

44:12.333 --> 44:14.458
Help me wrap him, Bickley.

44:31.833 --> 44:34.559
We bury him tonight.

44:34.583 --> 44:37.458
We're not waiting for good weather. It
could be months in a place like this.

44:38.416 --> 44:40.250
I have a bad feeling, sir.

44:41.500 --> 44:43.309
It's this island.

44:43.333 --> 44:46.166
It's not just the island.
It's the people.

44:48.500 --> 44:50.976
I've been stashing
supplies, sir...

44:51.000 --> 44:52.976
Food, oil, water.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.059
I think we should make
a break for it tonight.

44:55.083 --> 44:57.351
And we take Ferris with us,
give him to the sea.

44:57.375 --> 45:00.517
It doesn't look like this ship's
going to materialize anytime soon.

45:00.541 --> 45:03.392
I'll make a start in getting
things in order, sir.

45:03.416 --> 45:04.958
Bickley.

45:07.250 --> 45:08.833
Good lad.

45:16.250 --> 45:18.517
Please don't leave.

45:18.541 --> 45:19.976
Lanthe.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.833
Sorry. I didn't mean
to frighten you.

45:22.958 --> 45:24.791
How long have you been there?

45:26.583 --> 45:28.458
Don't go. Not yet.

45:30.083 --> 45:33.000
We need to give Ferris
a proper seaman's burial.

45:34.458 --> 45:36.500
You're not coming back.

45:38.708 --> 45:40.458
I know you're not.

45:47.041 --> 45:48.916
Why don't you come with us?

45:53.166 --> 45:54.791
I can't leave.

45:56.250 --> 45:58.267
Why?

45:58.291 --> 46:01.267
You could have a life here.
Help us rebuild the island.

46:01.291 --> 46:03.750
We don't belong here, Lanthe.
Neither do you.

46:06.250 --> 46:09.208
Lanthe?

46:10.625 --> 46:12.333
Are you all right?

46:24.208 --> 46:26.000
Stay, Oliver.

46:43.625 --> 46:45.083
Excuse me.

46:55.250 --> 46:56.791
I'm feeling a little unwell.

46:57.916 --> 47:00.726
Why don't you come inside,

47:00.750 --> 47:02.958
and I'll take a look at you.

47:06.500 --> 47:09.226
No! Leave him alone!
Lanthe, stop!

48:02.500 --> 48:03.958
No!

48:51.041 --> 48:52.791
Where have you been?

48:55.166 --> 48:56.958
Let's go.

49:24.416 --> 49:26.767
Oh, shit.

49:26.791 --> 49:28.750
It looks like he's in.

49:31.416 --> 49:34.184
Well, you take
Ferris down to the boat.

49:34.208 --> 49:36.000
I'll go and check.

50:04.041 --> 50:06.642
Jesus, man!

50:06.666 --> 50:09.250
Sorry, sir.
Is he in there?

50:10.416 --> 50:13.583
He's asleep.
Let's be quick.

50:22.541 --> 50:24.642
Sorry.

50:24.666 --> 50:26.458
It's my shoulder.

50:39.625 --> 50:42.500
Shh! Quiet, boy.

50:48.333 --> 50:50.916
Sorry, Ferris.
Cold hands.

51:24.083 --> 51:26.166
This is as good a place as any.

51:27.250 --> 51:28.750
Oars in.

51:38.041 --> 51:39.541
Uh...

51:41.500 --> 51:43.250
Jim?

51:48.166 --> 51:49.583
Well...

51:52.833 --> 51:55.166
You were a good lad, Cailean.

51:57.250 --> 51:59.017
Awful sailor, but a good lad.

52:01.416 --> 52:04.708
I never heard you speak
a bad word against anyone.

52:07.625 --> 52:09.559
I'm sorry I wasn't there,

52:09.583 --> 52:11.541
I should have been.

52:16.291 --> 52:17.791
Come on.

52:45.666 --> 52:47.833
God be with you,
Mr. Ferris.

53:01.291 --> 53:03.726
Maybe we should go back.

53:03.750 --> 53:06.642
Leave at first light instead.
What? No.

53:06.666 --> 53:10.017
We've got everything with us,
I'm not going back there.

53:10.041 --> 53:12.642
I can't see anything out here.

53:12.666 --> 53:15.476
No, I won't be able to navigate.
We'll have to go back.

53:15.500 --> 53:17.392
That doesn't make sense, sir.

53:17.416 --> 53:20.309
We knew it was going to be hard.
Look, we can't give up now.

53:20.333 --> 53:22.767
No. No, it's no good.
We'll have to turn back.

53:22.791 --> 53:25.017
Stop! Stop!

53:25.041 --> 53:27.476
We have to get out of the mist!
We have to turn back!

53:27.500 --> 53:29.267
It's her, isn't it?

53:29.291 --> 53:31.226
What has she done to you?

53:31.250 --> 53:32.976
We can't be out here!

53:33.000 --> 53:35.059
Shit!
Which way's South?

53:35.083 --> 53:36.934
What?
I can't hear you.

53:40.125 --> 53:41.833
What was that?

53:43.000 --> 53:45.541
Bickley, what was that?
Quiet, sir!

53:49.333 --> 53:51.208
It's a ship.

53:53.500 --> 53:55.017
Hello!

53:55.041 --> 53:56.601
Hello?
Can you hear me?

53:56.625 --> 53:58.892
A light!
Head for the light.

53:58.916 --> 54:01.559
No! No, turn about!

54:01.583 --> 54:03.726
Stay away from the light!

54:21.000 --> 54:22.767
Oh! Oh!

54:22.791 --> 54:24.934
Oh, my God!
We need to help them!

54:24.958 --> 54:27.476
I, I don't know where they are!
It's like they're all around us!

54:27.500 --> 54:29.684
Where, where are you?
Swim to us!

54:29.708 --> 54:31.434
Swim to us!

54:31.458 --> 54:34.684
Bickley! Help me!

54:34.708 --> 54:36.434
Ferris?

54:36.458 --> 54:37.726
What?

54:37.750 --> 54:39.226
I heard him calling me.

54:39.250 --> 54:41.601
That's impossible.
He called my name!

54:41.625 --> 54:43.934
Ferris! Ferris!

54:43.958 --> 54:46.767
Ferris! Ferris!

54:46.791 --> 54:48.684
It's coming towards us!

54:58.208 --> 55:00.809
Oliver! Jim!

55:00.833 --> 55:04.101
Can you hear me?
Come back to shore!

55:19.000 --> 55:22.392
Quickly! Come with me!
We have to help them!

55:22.416 --> 55:24.684
There's a ship that's
broken up on the rocks!

55:24.708 --> 55:26.684
We need to do something, Fingal!

55:26.708 --> 55:28.476
No, we don't!

55:28.500 --> 55:30.559
Get inside.
They're drowning out there!

55:30.583 --> 55:33.166
We heard them!
MacLeod!

55:53.166 --> 55:55.601
Sit.
Fingal, why won't you help them?

55:55.625 --> 55:58.642
There was no boat tonight!

55:58.666 --> 56:02.083
We heard...
What you heard happened five years ago.

56:04.750 --> 56:07.517
When the food plight
really took hold,

56:07.541 --> 56:09.392
our boys stayed out
at sea for days,

56:09.416 --> 56:12.351
trying to catch
anything they could.

56:12.375 --> 56:16.851
One night, they got caught
in a dreadful storm,

56:16.875 --> 56:19.392
the likes none of us
had witnessed before.

56:19.416 --> 56:22.434
And you think that's what we heard?
I know that's what you heard.

56:22.458 --> 56:24.434
I hear it.

56:24.458 --> 56:26.892
Hear them calling for my help.

56:26.916 --> 56:30.000
I think you've been
alone here too long.

56:34.791 --> 56:36.125
Sit.

56:46.625 --> 56:48.392
A few years back,

56:48.416 --> 56:51.517
I found the body of a young
woman washed up on the shore.

56:53.416 --> 56:55.666
Aye, it was a fine evening.

56:56.958 --> 56:59.434
Ah, but I think
my dancing days are over.

56:59.458 --> 57:01.142
Did you ever have any?

57:01.166 --> 57:04.434
I'll have you know I cut
a fine caper in my day.

57:04.458 --> 57:06.642
Here, your Korrigan
was in fine form.

57:06.666 --> 57:09.642
Aye. Had to drag
her away in the end.

57:09.666 --> 57:12.166
Jacob was in a strange mood.

57:13.250 --> 57:14.976
Ah.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.976
Our Billy's always
in a strange mood.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.017
What's he up to now?
Better go and fetch him.

57:22.041 --> 57:23.916
Aye. Come on then.

57:38.041 --> 57:40.059
It wasn't long after that

57:40.083 --> 57:42.517
that the crops started failing.

57:42.541 --> 57:44.767
Nothing would grow.

57:44.791 --> 57:48.267
The livestock took ill
and slowly died.

57:48.291 --> 57:50.101
People's livelihoods
were destroyed.

57:50.125 --> 57:52.517
Whole families were starving

57:52.541 --> 57:54.958
and had no choice but to leave.

57:56.750 --> 57:59.309
It's a curse placed
on the island...

57:59.333 --> 58:01.017
by her.

58:01.041 --> 58:04.476
By who?
The drowned woman?

58:04.500 --> 58:06.559
I call her Persephone.

58:06.583 --> 58:08.684
After the Greek myth.

58:08.708 --> 58:10.458
What?

58:12.333 --> 58:16.726
I read it in Fingal's book. She was
known as the goddess of death.

58:16.750 --> 58:19.476
Persephone was
abducted by Hades,

58:19.500 --> 58:22.351
and it was believed that,
because of this,

58:22.375 --> 58:24.851
nothing grew
and the people starved.

58:24.875 --> 58:27.559
What's that got to do
with shipwrecked fishermen?

58:27.583 --> 58:30.226
It's her curse.

58:30.250 --> 58:33.500
She torments us
with the sound of death.

58:50.208 --> 58:51.809
Where have you been?

58:51.833 --> 58:54.000
What are you doing
sitting in the dark, man?

58:55.791 --> 58:57.434
Where are they?

58:57.458 --> 58:59.476
I don't know.
Where are they, Lanthe?

58:59.500 --> 59:01.892
I was out looking for them.

59:01.916 --> 59:04.541
Don't lie to me! Lanthe.

59:10.041 --> 59:12.309
No!
No! Upstairs.

59:12.333 --> 59:13.934
No!
It's for your own good!

59:13.958 --> 59:15.601
No, Uncle! Please don't!

59:15.625 --> 59:17.458
I can help! No!

59:27.375 --> 59:28.708
You!

59:31.166 --> 59:33.434
I want a word with you.

59:33.458 --> 59:36.517
I've warned you before.

59:36.541 --> 59:39.875
I don't want you going
anywhere near her!

59:41.791 --> 59:44.642
I saw the two of you
up by the farm.

59:44.666 --> 59:47.416
You know you can't be
talking to Lanthe.

59:48.416 --> 59:50.226
I know what's happening!

59:50.250 --> 59:53.809
You keep away from her!

59:53.833 --> 59:55.809
You go back to the cottage,

59:55.833 --> 59:57.934
and I'll go and see
what the commotion is about.

59:57.958 --> 59:59.851
Would you like me
to come with you?

59:59.875 --> 01:00:02.500
No, you go back.
And stay inside.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.851
"Persephone had
two sirens as companions.

01:00:08.875 --> 01:00:11.851
When they failed to stop
her abduction by Hades,

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:14.851
their song, a beautiful,
sad melody,

01:00:14.875 --> 01:00:17.767
eternally called for her return.

01:00:17.791 --> 01:00:21.559
It lured ships
onto the rocks."

01:00:21.583 --> 01:00:22.726
Ships...

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:25.642
Stop! Stop!

01:00:25.666 --> 01:00:27.934
Turn back! Turn back!

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:30.142
I tried to help
them, but they couldn't hear me.

01:00:30.166 --> 01:00:32.767
That awful deafening sound.

01:00:32.791 --> 01:00:35.434
I still hear it constantly
in my head...

01:00:35.458 --> 01:00:39.416
The cries of all those poor,
lost souls.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.392
More families have left.

01:00:43.416 --> 01:00:45.583
Fled in fear.

01:00:51.833 --> 01:00:53.642
This is going to have to stop.

01:00:53.666 --> 01:00:56.267
You're gonna end up killing her.

01:00:56.291 --> 01:00:57.916
I'm trying.

01:00:59.791 --> 01:01:01.958
What are you doing, man?

01:01:07.291 --> 01:01:09.309
What's got into you,
for goodness sake?

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.184
Come off it, MacLeod.

01:01:11.208 --> 01:01:13.642
You know as well as I do
this is happening again.

01:01:13.666 --> 01:01:15.601
We don't know that.

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:16.934
Your daughter is dangerous.

01:01:16.958 --> 01:01:19.017
You to keep a closer eye on her.

01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:21.708
And I suppose your Lanthe is
doing well, is she? Coping?

01:01:23.875 --> 01:01:27.250
We just need to keep them
away from each other.

01:01:29.041 --> 01:01:31.625
Aye. Agreed.

01:02:08.416 --> 01:02:12.476
What have you got there?
We were right.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.309
There is no supply boat.

01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:17.892
The last boat logged
was a year ago,

01:02:17.916 --> 01:02:19.851
almost to the day.

01:02:19.875 --> 01:02:21.250
Look what happened to it.

01:02:22.958 --> 01:02:25.101
"All souls lost."

01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:26.601
Here's another.

01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:29.333
Almost the same date
the year before.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.541
"All souls lost."

01:02:38.458 --> 01:02:40.666
Bickley...

01:02:47.833 --> 01:02:50.517
Now, what do you say
to another drop of rum,

01:02:50.541 --> 01:02:52.625
to keep the nightmares at bay?

01:03:17.916 --> 01:03:19.684
No.

01:03:19.708 --> 01:03:20.916
Sir?

01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:24.517
You go on ahead,
Bickley. I...

01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:27.142
I think I might explore
the island a little.

01:03:27.166 --> 01:03:30.142
Are you sure, sir? I really
think we should stick together.

01:03:30.166 --> 01:03:33.291
I just want to try and find out a little
more about what actually happened here.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.809
Something's very much amiss,

01:03:36.833 --> 01:03:40.041
but I refuse to believe that
a mythical being is to blame.

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:43.166
What?

01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:48.059
I'll see you back
at the farmhouse, Jim.

01:03:48.083 --> 01:03:50.125
I won't be long.

01:05:03.083 --> 01:05:05.250
Oliver.

01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:07.875
Hello?

01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:11.958
Hello?

01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:23.291
Hello?

01:05:26.833 --> 01:05:28.166
Hello?

01:05:29.666 --> 01:05:33.208
Hello!

01:06:48.541 --> 01:06:51.583
September 20, 1840.

01:06:53.083 --> 01:06:55.851
Tonight is the Mabon dance.

01:06:55.875 --> 01:06:58.559
The village is alive
with comings and goings,

01:06:58.583 --> 01:07:02.184
everyone gathering what they can to
celebrate the last of the harvest

01:07:02.208 --> 01:07:04.559
and stockpiling
for the long, dark days ahead.

01:07:04.583 --> 01:07:05.976
Morning, Lorna.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.017
Our bounteous isle giving way

01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:10.708
to the inevitable
cold grasp of winter.

01:07:12.583 --> 01:07:14.309
I went out this morning.

01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:16.226
Managed to hit
a couple more brace of grouse

01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:18.976
and bumped into Lorna Elliot.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.267
Morning, Jacob.
How are you on this fine day?

01:07:22.291 --> 01:07:25.351
Very well, thank you.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.726
I hope I'll be seeing
you at the dance.

01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:29.684
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

01:07:29.708 --> 01:07:32.333
I'm off to pick flowers
for the hall now.

01:07:35.041 --> 01:07:38.392
I actually managed to pluck up the
courage and ask her for a dance.

01:07:38.416 --> 01:07:40.184
Save a dance for me.

01:07:40.208 --> 01:07:42.017
Maybe she does like me.

01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:45.017
Ridiculous.
Running away with myself.

01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:47.642
She only smiled at me,
for God's sake.

01:07:47.666 --> 01:07:50.017
And there's Billy Innis,
of course.

01:07:50.041 --> 01:07:51.934
He'll be prowling around her,

01:07:51.958 --> 01:07:54.309
marking his territory
as if she belongs to him.

01:07:54.333 --> 01:07:55.476
I was hoping I'd see you here.
Oh!

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.976
I didn't see you there.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.476
Hope I didn't frighten you.
No. No.

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.684
I just need to get these
flowers picked for tonight.

01:08:03.708 --> 01:08:05.517
Funny you should mention that.

01:08:05.541 --> 01:08:07.351
What time should I pick you up?

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:09.476
Oh, no, I'm fine.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.434
I'll make my own way there.

01:08:11.458 --> 01:08:12.916
Thank you.

01:08:13.833 --> 01:08:16.142
But I'll see you there.

01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:17.500
Good day.

01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:55.082
Right!

01:09:00.541 --> 01:09:03.166
Come on!
Show yourself!

01:09:04.125 --> 01:09:05.916
Where are you?

01:09:19.457 --> 01:09:21.225
It was a bonnie night.

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:23.350
Everyone was in high spirits.

01:09:23.375 --> 01:09:26.375
Douglas Innis could
barely stand by the end.

01:09:27.541 --> 01:09:30.059
I saw something on my way home,

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:32.000
and I've been turning it
over and over.

01:09:34.291 --> 01:09:37.142
At first I couldn't make out
who it was with Billy.

01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:39.041
And then I saw her dress.

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.725
It just doesn't make any sense.

01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:45.392
She'd been dancing
with me all night.

01:09:45.416 --> 01:09:48.184
What are you reading?

01:09:48.207 --> 01:09:49.832
Lanthe!

01:10:01.458 --> 01:10:04.291
I'm sorry I left. I...
It's fine.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:07.517
We had to bury Ferris.

01:10:07.541 --> 01:10:09.416
I said it's fine.

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:14.125
Lanthe, I...

01:10:15.916 --> 01:10:18.809
Why did you go out in the dark?

01:10:18.833 --> 01:10:20.375
It isn't safe.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.125
What happened?

01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:29.916
It's nothing.

01:10:35.583 --> 01:10:37.976
We have to get off this island,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.250
and you have to come with us.

01:10:47.875 --> 01:10:49.458
They won't let me.

01:10:52.375 --> 01:10:53.833
Who won't?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.958
It doesn't matter.

01:11:26.125 --> 01:11:28.476
You have to stay away from me.

01:11:31.958 --> 01:11:34.875
Lanthe. Lanthe!

01:11:38.541 --> 01:11:40.541
Lanthe, please.

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.559
Let me help you.

01:11:43.583 --> 01:11:46.601
Leave me alone!

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:33.601
Jacob! Jacob!

01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:41.226
God's sake.
Were you born in a field?

01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:43.041
You're letting...

01:12:44.791 --> 01:12:47.267
Bickley?

01:12:47.291 --> 01:12:49.583
Oh, damn it.
Bickley!

01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:02.333
Jim!

01:13:03.583 --> 01:13:05.416
Jim!

01:13:10.791 --> 01:13:12.875
Jim!

01:13:56.791 --> 01:13:58.250
Oliver.

01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:01.333
You need to get up.

01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:04.666
Something's happened.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.642
No.

01:14:10.666 --> 01:14:12.726
Jacob, please, no!

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:15.517
That's not Jacob, Korrigan.
Leave him be.

01:14:15.541 --> 01:14:18.476
But she killed him!

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.976
Please, Korrigan, darling,
come away now.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.083
No.
Oh, dear God.

01:14:25.125 --> 01:14:27.434
Please, no, no!

01:14:27.458 --> 01:14:30.059
She did this.

01:14:30.083 --> 01:14:31.642
You killed him.

01:14:31.666 --> 01:14:34.434
You know I didn't do this,
Korrigan.

01:14:36.875 --> 01:14:39.976
Korrigan!
Take hold of her!

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.166
Get hold of her, Fingal.

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.958
Lanthe?

01:14:48.333 --> 01:14:50.476
What's happening to her?

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.833
Fingal, please!
Hold her still.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.833
Hold her head steady.

01:15:02.333 --> 01:15:05.267
Shh, Lanthe.
Lanthe, it's all right.

01:15:05.291 --> 01:15:08.500
It's all right. Shh.

01:15:09.333 --> 01:15:11.500
Lanthe?

01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:31.684
Lanthe! Where the
hell have you been, Innis?

01:15:31.708 --> 01:15:33.184
Lanthe!
What happened?

01:15:33.208 --> 01:15:35.517
She had one of her fits.
Where were you?

01:15:35.541 --> 01:15:37.976
I had to go out searching
for that idiot, Bickley.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.851
He took off in the night.
Then the mist came down.

01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:43.059
My lantern went out.
I had to shelter till light.

01:15:43.083 --> 01:15:45.583
Well, "that idiot Bickley"
is dead.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.351
Enough!

01:15:56.375 --> 01:15:58.642
No more excuses.

01:15:58.666 --> 01:16:01.476
What the hell is going on? You tell
me the truth, and you tell me now!

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:04.184
Calm down, Oliver.
You're scared. I understand.

01:16:04.208 --> 01:16:06.267
Of course I'm fucking scared!
Will you...

01:16:06.291 --> 01:16:09.309
You stay away from me.
You be quiet, Oliver.

01:16:09.333 --> 01:16:13.851
Lanthe is upstairs sleeping.
Now, get control of yourself.

01:16:13.875 --> 01:16:15.601
I want to know what is going on,

01:16:15.625 --> 01:16:17.726
and then I want to get off
this God forsaken island.

01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:21.208
And we want to help you, Oliver.
Will you just listen?

01:16:23.833 --> 01:16:26.166
Remember that drowned woman
I told you about?

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:29.375
Yes.

01:16:30.583 --> 01:16:33.309
The night before I found her,

01:16:33.333 --> 01:16:35.642
there'd been a dance.

01:16:35.666 --> 01:16:38.684
Evening, Billy. Good night for it.
Aye.

01:16:38.708 --> 01:16:41.541
Good to see you're
pacing yourself, lad.

01:16:44.583 --> 01:16:47.375
Take it easy, son.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.767
I haven't seen you dancing
much this evening, Billy.

01:16:52.791 --> 01:16:55.101
You're dancing enough
for the whole family.

01:16:55.125 --> 01:16:57.517
Oh, you're such a killjoy,
William Innis.

01:16:57.541 --> 01:17:00.726
Well, I might consider it if
my woman would dance with me.

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:02.476
Oh, and who might
that be, Billy?

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.601
I hope that's not me
you're referring to.

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:06.392
I'm nobody's woman.

01:17:06.416 --> 01:17:09.642
Aye, until it suits you, Lorna.
Says you, you strumpet.

01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:12.267
I'm not the one that's been flirting
with Davey Campbell all evening.

01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:15.958
Oh, ho, ho! I'll have no sister
of mine talking to a Campbell!

01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:22.559
Well, I'm ready
for another reel.

01:17:22.583 --> 01:17:25.392
Aye. Maybe a wee bit more
of that punch as well.

01:17:25.416 --> 01:17:28.309
I think I might head back.
I'm feeling pretty tired.

01:17:28.333 --> 01:17:30.625
As you wish.
Mind how you go.

01:17:33.375 --> 01:17:35.017
I'll keep you
company if you like.

01:17:35.041 --> 01:17:36.642
No, I'll take her home.
Billy...

01:17:36.666 --> 01:17:39.559
No worries.
I'll be fine on my own.

01:17:39.583 --> 01:17:41.875
I'll see you
in the morning, Jacob.

01:17:48.583 --> 01:17:50.767
Come on.
Let's have a drink.

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:52.934
Listen, MacLeod!

01:17:52.958 --> 01:17:55.351
She and I have an understanding.

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:57.541
She doesn't think so, Billy.

01:17:58.833 --> 01:18:00.892
Are you saying I'm lying?

01:18:07.541 --> 01:18:09.517
What's going on here?

01:18:09.541 --> 01:18:11.875
Nothing, Uncle.

01:18:13.125 --> 01:18:16.226
Jacob, your the wants to...

01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:18.166
Better go in to...

01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:29.000
Billy...

01:18:29.833 --> 01:18:31.375
I'll be in.

01:19:20.333 --> 01:19:22.601
Stop, you...

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:25.809
Stop! Stay quiet, woman!
Shut it!

01:19:25.833 --> 01:19:28.559
We don't want anyone to hear.

01:19:28.583 --> 01:19:31.559
This has to be our secret, okay?

01:19:34.458 --> 01:19:35.601
Okay?

01:20:09.291 --> 01:20:11.101
Quiet!

01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:14.476
Shush!

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.500
Stay still, for fuck's sake!

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:47.559
No.
No, please don't.

01:20:47.583 --> 01:20:51.434
Wake up. Wake up!
Please...

01:20:51.458 --> 01:20:54.059
No, please don't.

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:56.434
I'm s...
I'm sorry.

01:20:56.458 --> 01:20:59.375
I didn't mean to.

01:21:00.666 --> 01:21:03.267
Lorna Elliot.

01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:04.958
Poor thing.

01:21:08.375 --> 01:21:12.351
She must have fallen over the cliffs
on her way home from the dance.

01:21:12.375 --> 01:21:14.601
This was no accident, Douglas.

01:21:14.625 --> 01:21:17.184
Look at the bruising.

01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:20.226
What if this was
one of our lads?

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:23.517
You said you'd caught them
arguing over her last night.

01:21:23.541 --> 01:21:26.017
God, Fingal.

01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:28.226
You know what this'll mean.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:30.791
They'll come here
looking for who did this.

01:21:33.083 --> 01:21:35.166
Someone will hang.

01:21:37.958 --> 01:21:39.767
Right.

01:21:39.791 --> 01:21:42.267
We'll bury her properly at sea.

01:21:42.291 --> 01:21:44.601
Then we'll never
speak of this again.

01:21:44.625 --> 01:21:47.309
We can't do that.
What about her family?

01:21:47.333 --> 01:21:49.559
What about our families?

01:21:49.583 --> 01:21:51.892
Billy? Your Jacob?

01:21:51.916 --> 01:21:53.708
They're young men.

01:21:55.875 --> 01:21:58.309
Aye.

01:21:58.333 --> 01:22:00.809
They've both got
their lives ahead of them.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:02.791
So you covered it up.

01:22:05.125 --> 01:22:07.017
And no one knew
what happened to her?

01:22:07.041 --> 01:22:09.916
Aye. And now
she haunts us.

01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:15.309
She uses the women.
She controls them.

01:22:15.333 --> 01:22:17.434
Lanthe and Korrigan
don't know what they're doing,

01:22:17.458 --> 01:22:19.916
and we're powerless to stop her.

01:22:21.958 --> 01:22:25.142
Then all of you need
to get off the island.

01:22:25.166 --> 01:22:27.583
Do you not think we've tried?

01:22:31.416 --> 01:22:33.166
Where are they?

01:22:38.041 --> 01:22:39.767
No.

01:22:39.791 --> 01:22:41.476
No, no, no, no, please.

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:44.476
Please.
Korrigan. Korrigan!

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.767
Korrigan! It's Jacob. It's me!
It's your brother!

01:23:12.791 --> 01:23:15.642
Stop!
Please stop!

01:23:15.666 --> 01:23:17.892
Jacob! Jacob!

01:23:21.083 --> 01:23:24.017
She'll never let us forget.
Jacob!

01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:26.892
This is our punishment...

01:23:26.916 --> 01:23:31.166
To have to watch our innocent
girls take everyone we care for.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.208
We'll have to try and get you away
from here as soon as possible.

01:23:42.375 --> 01:23:43.976
I'll make sure
Lanthe can't get out.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.226
Oliver, you get
your things together.

01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:49.267
Fingal and I will then make sure
that Korrigan's locked up.

01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:50.666
We'll meet you on the beach.

01:23:52.458 --> 01:23:54.000
Douglas...

01:24:14.625 --> 01:24:16.708
See that Lanthe
gets that, please.

01:24:36.333 --> 01:24:37.958
Lanthe...

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:41.416
I'm sorry.

01:24:45.458 --> 01:24:47.559
I know.

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:49.809
It's all right.

01:24:49.833 --> 01:24:51.625
Good girl.

01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:54.517
Quick, lad. In.

01:25:54.541 --> 01:25:57.184
Oliver!
You need to get away.

01:25:57.208 --> 01:26:00.017
Keep true North for six miles,
then North-Northeast,

01:26:00.041 --> 01:26:02.726
and the gods willing, you'll
find the mainland eventually.

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:05.184
Here. You're going to need these.
Put them in your ears.

01:26:05.208 --> 01:26:08.142
Don't take them out till
you're away from the mist.

01:26:08.166 --> 01:26:10.184
It's their song.

01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:11.934
That's why we wrecked in the first place.
Aye, aye, aye.

01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:14.226
And if you hear it, you'll be powerless.
Now, come on.

01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:16.684
The wax. It worked
for Odysseus laddie.

01:26:16.708 --> 01:26:19.809
Whatever happens,
don't take them out.

01:26:19.833 --> 01:26:23.333
Good luck. Try not to think
too harshly of us.

01:26:25.541 --> 01:26:27.500
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:26:36.250 --> 01:26:37.892
Lanthe?

01:26:37.916 --> 01:26:41.642
We have to stop him.
They've helped him escape.

01:26:41.666 --> 01:26:45.142
You...
He must not leave!

01:26:45.166 --> 01:26:47.351
You know what'll happen to us.

01:26:47.375 --> 01:26:50.833
I'll not help you anymore.
Let her go.

01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:55.017
Lanthe, listen to me.

01:26:55.041 --> 01:26:57.083
You have to fight her.
Lanthe!

01:27:09.291 --> 01:27:13.333
You will
do as we want, Korrigan.

01:27:43.041 --> 01:27:44.976
He's on his own now.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.625
Aye.
