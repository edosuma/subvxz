Not my fault, sir. The rifle's broken.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.920
We don't deal with excuses
in this establishment, Groff.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.160
Keep practicing,

02:00.600 --> 02:02.720
and try asking
some of your peers to help you.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.960
I don't need help, sir.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.040

02:19.880 --> 02:21.480
Fall out!

02:25.760 --> 02:28.120
Everyone inside.
Get your breakfast.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.760
-Come on, man, give it--
-What's wrong?

02:29.840 --> 02:31.520
This isn't funny,
just give me back the hat.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.240
-What's wrong with him?
- Hey!

02:33.320 --> 02:34.760
Give me the hat.

02:34.840 --> 02:37.320
-Give me the hat.
-Don't be a pussy, Luke. Oi, Groff!

02:39.520 --> 02:41.160
Nice one, muppet!

02:45.440 --> 02:46.560
Sorry.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.840
Bad luck, new kid.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.080
-War.
- Yeah, all right.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.200
Um, I'm late for school.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.440
Yeah...

03:43.520 --> 03:45.120
How long are you going to be?

03:54.840 --> 03:56.680
- Morning.
-Has Jakob moved in?

03:57.920 --> 03:59.680
No. Why?

03:59.760 --> 04:00.880
Bathroom is free.

04:05.280 --> 04:08.480
Darling, I've been looking through
your SRE textbook.

04:09.240 --> 04:13.640
There is no mention
of female pleasure at all.

04:14.840 --> 04:18.400
I was thinking of talking about it today
in assembly, what do you think?

04:19.080 --> 04:20.160
I don't know.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.120
Otis.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.200
I'd like your opinion, please.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.680
-Why?
-I've never worked with teenagers before,

04:26.760 --> 04:28.680
and you are a teenager.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.600
Yep, I'm a teenager who...

04:31.320 --> 04:34.840
doesn't want their mother
talking about sex at his school.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.680
There has been a sexual health crisis,

04:38.120 --> 04:40.160
and it's my duty to help.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.400
You know, he is right.

04:41.920 --> 04:42.920
It is a bit strange.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.120
Mmm, I mean,

04:44.200 --> 04:47.200
my mum's a sexual health expert
so it's not that strange, actually.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.640
Which doesn't mean
you should have said yes.

04:51.920 --> 04:56.720
Would you prefer to call me Mum
or Dr. Milburn at school?

04:56.800 --> 04:59.080
Neither.
I'll be pretending you don't exist.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.320
Otis.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.440
Okay. Just try and...

05:07.280 --> 05:08.400
Try and be a bit...

05:16.520 --> 05:18.960
Try and be less intense.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.440
It freaks people out.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.760
And it's embarrassing.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.800
I don't know, Mum, just be normal.
Try and be more relatable.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.920
Whatever, just don't humiliate me.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.320
Bye, darling. I'll see you later.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.000

06:24.920 --> 06:26.840
It's like it's her mission
to ruin my life.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.360
-Were you up all night wanking again?
-No.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.960
I've got a handle on that, actually.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.400
I didn't sleep much
because I've been doing research.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.240
-Research?
-Yeah.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.360
So, Ola and I were kissing the other night

06:38.440 --> 06:42.360
and she kept guiding my hand down
to her... area.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.480
-So I've been looking up--
-Fingering!

06:44.560 --> 06:46.360
Don't yell "fingering," please.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.280
-But, yes,

06:48.360 --> 06:52.320
she's coming over later,
and I think I'm fully prepared.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.120
Well, Otis, it's a vagina.
It's not an exam.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.720
Actually, it's very complicated.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.320
-Okay.
-I've been learning about something

06:58.400 --> 07:00.400
-called the clock technique.
-Oh, my God.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.360
Otis,
I think you might be overthinking this.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.480
She knows I'm a sex therapist now.
I need to get this right.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.400
Why is Angel Man staring at me
like he's plotting my death?

07:27.280 --> 07:29.880
I don't know. French people are intense.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.920
-Morning, dickhead.
-Oh, hey.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.880
-I've got an 8:30 and an 8:45.
-Okay.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.200
Why... why do you look so clean?

07:42.040 --> 07:44.520
-What does that mean?
-It's just an observation.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.680
Your aptitude scheme, of course.
Very professional, Maeve.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.800
Shut up.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.520
Can you do a session after school today,
by the way?

07:52.600 --> 07:54.400
Uh, I can't. I'm going to the fair.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.840
I thought you hated rides.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.960
Yeah, but Ola loves them, so...

08:01.200 --> 08:02.520
Are you going to be there?

08:03.400 --> 08:06.200
Funfairs are simply a distraction
from the inevitability of death.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.160
Oh, I guess they are.

08:08.680 --> 08:10.760
-Hmm.
-Have fun with the smart kids.

08:11.840 --> 08:12.760
You look great.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.960
-Oh, hey! How you doing?
-Hey. I'm good.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.640
This is nice. Shall we, uh...

08:23.000 --> 08:24.800
Oh, hi, Jackson.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.240
Hey, I'm sorry about your hand.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.280
-At least you don't have to swim anymore.
-What are you talking about?

08:36.800 --> 08:39.280
-You said you didn't want to swim.
-Listen, Maeve,

08:39.360 --> 08:41.040
you're not my girlfriend anymore,
all right?

08:41.480 --> 08:43.600
So you don't need to pretend
that you care.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.800
Whatever it is you thought I said,
you're wrong.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.560
Don't worry. You're gonna be fine.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.840
-May I sit here?
-Uh...

09:14.600 --> 09:15.520
Yes.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.080
Yeah, we'll find other seats.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.680
No. No, no. I mean next to you.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.320
Okay, sure.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.360
Rahim, you may sit with us.
These people are insignificant.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.280
No, I'm fine here. Thank you.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.920
Good morning, Moordale.

09:33.720 --> 09:38.880
Today we shall be hearing from
a sexual health expert

09:38.960 --> 09:42.800
who is here to review
the school's sex education curriculum.

09:42.880 --> 09:46.800
Please give Ms. Milburn...
a very warm welcome.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.240
Hello.

09:54.320 --> 09:58.080
My name is Dr. Milburn,

09:58.160 --> 10:02.480
and I'm here to start an open conversation

10:03.000 --> 10:06.560
about S-E-X.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.520
Uh, sex.

10:07.600 --> 10:12.320
We adults know
that some of you are having sex

10:12.400 --> 10:17.520
because when we were your age,
some of us were having sex.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.840
-In fact, many of us still have sex.

10:21.960 --> 10:27.320
I'm sure even Headmaster Groff
sometimes has sex.

10:28.280 --> 10:32.360
And so, I would like you to tell me

10:32.440 --> 10:37.080
what you would like
on your sex education curriculum.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.240
Take control.

10:46.360 --> 10:50.480
Perhaps you'd like to know about
the female orgasm...

10:51.480 --> 10:54.360
...or mutual masturbation.

10:56.440 --> 10:59.320
Or maybe you've always wondered,

10:59.400 --> 11:03.040
is my labia a normal length?

11:11.560 --> 11:13.480
What I'm saying is...

11:19.920 --> 11:22.920
<i>-♪ Let's talk about sex, baby ♪</i>

11:23.000 --> 11:25.960
<i>♪ Let's talk about you and me ♪</i>

11:26.040 --> 11:28.480
Didn't you wank off a courgette?

11:30.160 --> 11:32.240
Courgette! Courgette!

11:32.320 --> 11:34.200
Courgette! Courgette!

11:34.280 --> 11:36.160
Courgette! Courgette!

11:36.240 --> 11:38.320
Courgette! Courgette!

11:38.400 --> 11:40.400
Courgette! Courgette!

11:40.480 --> 11:41.760
Anyway...

11:43.000 --> 11:45.920
...there will be an empty box
at reception.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.560
If you have any questions,
it is anonymous,

11:48.640 --> 11:51.400
so put anything in there
that you would like to see

11:51.920 --> 11:54.000
-in the curriculum.
-Courgette wanker!

11:59.680 --> 12:02.240
Thank you very much, Moordale.

12:02.320 --> 12:06.080
I'm sure we would like
to say thank you to Ms., uh--

12:06.160 --> 12:08.520
Forgive me, Dr. Milburn, for her...

12:08.600 --> 12:11.200
I don't understand why
everyone is laughing at this nice lady.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.160
Uh, uh...

12:12.240 --> 12:13.880
Because it's high school.

12:13.960 --> 12:17.760
...happening this evening,
um, available at all prices.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.560
-Please be careful...
-I'm Rahim.

12:19.640 --> 12:20.840
...nut allergies...

12:20.920 --> 12:22.600
Uh, I'm Eric.

12:22.680 --> 12:23.960
...said issues...

12:24.040 --> 12:25.200
Goodbye, Eric.

12:27.720 --> 12:28.600
Bye.

12:28.680 --> 12:32.240
...nice place to go. I highly recommend
you, uh, you sign up to that.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.360
What was that?

12:40.960 --> 12:44.600
-Ah. Emily, howdy.
-Good morning, Mr. Hendricks.

12:47.520 --> 12:50.400
Now I see where you get
your terrible sex therapy skills from.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.640
Fancy putting in a question?

13:00.040 --> 13:02.160
No. Nay. Thank you.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.280
Um...

13:03.360 --> 13:06.080
I'm usually the person who answers
the awkward questions.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.120
-I'm Colin Hendricks.
-Oh...

13:08.200 --> 13:10.680
-You're the SRE teacher.
-Yes.

13:10.760 --> 13:11.920
Mr. Groff?

13:13.640 --> 13:18.400
I'd really like to observe
one of Colin's SRE classes, please.

13:18.480 --> 13:22.600
As I keep saying Ms. Milburn,
our curriculum is quite satisfactory.

13:22.680 --> 13:24.440
Well, if it's as...

13:25.040 --> 13:27.880
satisfactory as you keep saying,
then you won't mind

13:27.960 --> 13:29.640
if I sit in on one of the classes.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.400
Of course not.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.760
But I'm sure that any questions
that appear in this box

13:34.840 --> 13:38.240
will very easily be answered
by Mr. Hendricks, isn't that right, Colin?

13:38.320 --> 13:39.400
Uh...

13:39.480 --> 13:40.480
Absolutely.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.920
Yes. Yes.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.280
I am, um, I'm-I'm a master of sex.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.640
Very good.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.000
Good day.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.920
The school is right behind you, Jackson.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.560
We will do everything in our power
to support your speedy recovery.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.560
Thank you, sir.

14:08.160 --> 14:12.240
However, your parents and I feel
it would be in your best interest

14:12.320 --> 14:15.440
to be paired with an academic tutor
for the rest of term.

14:15.520 --> 14:16.360
A peer.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.160
But my... my grades are fine.

14:18.240 --> 14:22.000
Well, you can get by on fine
when you're a star in the pool,

14:22.080 --> 14:25.800
but when you're not... you have to work
as hard as everybody else.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.120
Good morning, brains of the future.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.800
I'm very happy to welcome Maeve Wiley
to the program.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.320
Make her feel at home, please.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.440
All right.

14:38.520 --> 14:41.480
Let's read out our ten-years'-time essays.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.520
We have to read them out loud?

14:44.720 --> 14:46.080
Who wants to go first?

14:48.480 --> 14:50.640
I strive for excellence
in everything I do.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.160
The points I gain
from my extracurricular activities

14:54.240 --> 14:56.560
will earn me a place in Oxbridge
where I will...

14:56.640 --> 15:00.240
Compete in the IFBB
Bodybuilding Championships whilst...

15:00.320 --> 15:03.360
Keeping me on track to become
the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom

15:03.440 --> 15:04.960
by the age of 30, which will...

15:05.040 --> 15:09.080
Land me an Erasmus scholarship
to NYU Film and Television School

15:09.560 --> 15:12.160
and then I'll make
investigative documentaries using my...

15:12.240 --> 15:13.400
Purple penis hands.

15:14.680 --> 15:18.080
<i>The Chronicles of Glenoxi</i>
is an epic alien love comic book series

15:18.160 --> 15:20.200
that will be made into
a global movie franchise

15:20.280 --> 15:21.760
and eventually be screened in space.

15:25.080 --> 15:27.320
Right, last but not least.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.880
Maeve, you're up.

15:33.840 --> 15:38.320
I left my essay at home,
Miss Sands. Sorry.

15:38.920 --> 15:42.120
Maeve, this class is for people
who want to plan for their future

15:42.200 --> 15:43.920
and optimize their opportunities.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.280
Organizational skills are key.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.760
Don't let it happen again.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.720
All right, uh, thanks to Maeve,
you can all...

15:52.240 --> 15:53.600
head off to lunch early.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.080
Oh... eh, um, uh...

15:56.160 --> 16:00.360
On a side note,
since Nigel moved back to Australia,

16:00.440 --> 16:03.280
the Moordale Quiz Heads
are looking for a new member

16:03.360 --> 16:04.960
to join the team and compete

16:05.040 --> 16:08.400
at the National Student Quiz Championships
this year.

16:08.480 --> 16:11.680
So, who's interested in joining
Viv, Dex and Steve

16:11.760 --> 16:13.120
in representing their school?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.040
Oh, right, all of you then?

16:18.720 --> 16:22.640
Okay, well, I'll make my decision
by tomorrow. Off you go.

16:30.360 --> 16:34.040
Man, I just don't get why
Maeve Wiley is in this class.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.920
Are you Vivienne Odesanya?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.200
Yeah, that's me, why?

16:44.280 --> 16:46.240
-Jackson Marchetti.
-I know who you are.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.080
Okay.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.760
So, Headmaster Groff said
you'd tutor me this term?

16:50.840 --> 16:51.680
Did he now?

16:51.760 --> 16:53.680
Apparently, you're the smartest kid
in the school.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.040
That's true, but I'm also busy.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.200
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.320
Headmaster Groff said he'd give you
extra credit if you'd help me out.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.320
And we don't actually have to do any work.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.920
I've just got to keep Groff happy
until I'm back in the pool.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.320
-Okay. Your first session's tonight.
-Yeah?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.600
Yeah, but it's the fair tonight.

17:08.680 --> 17:11.600
Listen, my schedule's organized
for optimum time management.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.600
Take it or leave it.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.720
Picnic tables, six o'clock.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.080
Bring your maths homework,
and don't be late.

17:25.120 --> 17:27.400
Should have seen this smug look
Ola gave me earlier.

17:29.040 --> 17:29.960
I don't like her.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.560
Why? She seems nice.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.400
She's still hung up on Otis.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.680
It's got nothing to do with Otis.
I'm over him.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.800
-How you getting on with your form?
- Everyone has a thing except me.

17:43.880 --> 17:47.000
I'm hoping this form
is gonna tell me what my thing is.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.040
-Your thing?
-Yes, my thing.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.680
You have your feminine books.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.920
-Feminist.
-Steve has his Quiz Brains thing.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.040
Quiz Heads.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.880
So great being part of the team.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.400
What's so good about it?

18:00.480 --> 18:02.080
Well, facts are fun,

18:02.160 --> 18:06.360
and if we get through to the final,
it's going to be a very big deal.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.160
What's your form say?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
It says I should be a baker.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.000
Aims, I think it might be banker.
Baker's not on there.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.760
Banker?

18:19.440 --> 18:20.400
Hmm.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.320
I think I'm going to stick with baker.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.360
I do really like toast.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.160
Wow.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.760
Maeve thinks she's so scary
and revolutionary

18:37.840 --> 18:39.640
just because she used to have pink hair.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.920
Is it because she hangs out
with your boyfriend all the time?

18:42.000 --> 18:42.920
No.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.400
She's just not my kind of person.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.040
Why? Do you think it's weird
that they run the sex clinic together?

18:51.600 --> 18:52.440
Yes.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.240
-So, how's it going with Otis?
-Good.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.040
Yeah, well, kind of.
Yeah, we're taking things slow.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.200
Which is fine.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.560
I sometimes just wish
we'd move along a bit, you know.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.120
Not overthink so much.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.840
Has he touched your vagina?

19:09.920 --> 19:10.800
Not yet.

19:11.320 --> 19:13.800
He sort of hovers
and then loses his nerve.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.920
It's... really frustrating.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.160
-Just tell him what you want.
-I think it'll freak him out.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.440
Human boys are so fragile.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.600
- Such an idiot.
-What are you laughing at?

19:41.920 --> 19:43.000
Nothing.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.800
Then what's so funny?

19:45.880 --> 19:48.520
Luke spilled some water
and it looks like he's pissed himself.

19:50.520 --> 19:51.880
You need to chill out, man.

19:52.760 --> 19:53.680
Look...

19:56.920 --> 19:58.240
grab it with your right...

19:58.880 --> 20:01.080
and let your left slap it.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.840
Took me ages to get it as well.

20:25.760 --> 20:26.760
Is this okay?

20:26.840 --> 20:27.880
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.080
Okay.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.200
Yep.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.520
Oh!

20:52.920 --> 20:54.160
Oh. Ah.

20:54.240 --> 20:58.720
Twelve o'clock,
three o'clock, six o'clock, nine o'clock.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.720
Did you say something?

21:01.480 --> 21:02.840
No, sorry.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.640
Are you enjoying it?

21:11.120 --> 21:15.040
-Then spread it. Back to 12 o'clock...

21:15.120 --> 21:17.080
...three o'clock, nine o'clock.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.400
-Ooh.
-Ooh?

21:27.480 --> 21:28.840
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.320
-Wow.
-Yeah.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.440
It was good?

21:31.520 --> 21:33.920
It was... so nice.

21:36.440 --> 21:37.480
Okay.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.680
It was really, really bad.

21:41.760 --> 21:45.160
He was moving his fingers
like he was dialing a 1920s telephone,

21:45.240 --> 21:48.080
but really fast, with no rhythm.

21:48.160 --> 21:50.960
And then he was kind of, like,
jabbing at the same time.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.920
And then he kept looking at the clock
on his wall

21:53.000 --> 21:55.040
like he was timing himself or something.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.200
You need to tell him it was bad.

21:57.280 --> 21:58.960
Uh-uh. It'll hurt his feelings.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.560
Maybe it will be better next time?

22:03.480 --> 22:05.240
I-I definitely have to tell him.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.720
- Did you do it?
-Uh-huh.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.560
-I know!

22:08.640 --> 22:11.120
I knew you had
a freshly-fingered glow about you!

22:11.200 --> 22:12.920
-Tell me everything.
-So...

22:13.000 --> 22:16.560
I think I might have facilitated
a crescendo.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.000
-The big O?
-Yeah.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.480
-First time round?
-Yeah.

22:20.560 --> 22:23.720
I stuck to my clock technique,
and I don't know, bingo.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.680
-My God.
-Orgasm town.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.560
I feel like maybe fingering
is my sexual superpower or something.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.160
Oh, dude, I'm so proud of you.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.760
-Thanks, man.
-Let's go celebrate.

22:32.840 --> 22:35.440
-What shall we do first?
-You don't think it was beginner's luck,

22:35.520 --> 22:37.040
-do you?
-No.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.440
No, no, no, no, no,
you're definitely Fingertron.

22:39.920 --> 22:43.560
Oh, my God!
They have Crazy Jungle, come on.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.000
Why am I here? I hate fairs.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.160
You're here because
Steve is doing extra study

22:56.240 --> 22:59.080
for your stupid altitude scheme.
You're my date.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.120
-Aptitude scheme, Aimee.
-Yeah, that's what I said.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.920
-Yeah.
-Can you win me a giant pig?

23:05.680 --> 23:06.600
Hi.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.600
Hey.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.640
And we have a winner.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.520
I need to go find Otis.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.480
That's the kind of competitive spirit

23:38.560 --> 23:40.760
you should be bringing
to aptitude scheme, Maeve.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.000
See you tomorrow in class.

23:50.640 --> 23:51.680
I'll be right back.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.440
Ms. Sands. Ms. Sands.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.480
Um...

23:57.560 --> 24:00.280
I did write the...
the ten-years'-time essay.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.120
I didn't realize we had to read it out,
so I got embarrassed.

24:05.040 --> 24:08.520
"In ten years' time, I want to live
in a house with big windows,

24:08.600 --> 24:12.120
I want the house to be large enough
to have a kitchen table with four chairs

24:12.200 --> 24:15.200
but not too roomy
to ever feel the depth of my aloneness.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.600
Because I'll probably be alone.

24:19.840 --> 24:23.320
But I think aloneness won't feel
so all-consuming with windows

24:23.400 --> 24:26.360
that protect me from the world
but still let me watch it."

24:26.440 --> 24:28.160
I'm sorry. Sorry.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.120
I don't think I belong in the class.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.720
You're a beautiful writer, Maeve.

24:40.560 --> 24:44.360
You can have more expansive dreams
than four chairs and some windows.

24:47.440 --> 24:48.520
Think about it.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.640
-What? What?
-You're really not good at this.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.200
Have you got a problem with me
or something?

25:06.280 --> 25:08.080
Look, uh, it's simple.

25:08.160 --> 25:10.440
So this is hidden quadratics.

25:10.520 --> 25:13.360
You need to substitute the Y...

25:13.440 --> 25:16.160
-Mm-hmm.
-...and then back substitute...

25:17.000 --> 25:18.120
the X.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.720
Oh. See, no one's ever explained it
to me like this before.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.760
You dating Pythagoras, Jackson?

25:24.840 --> 25:26.600
Nah, mate, we're just studying.

25:28.680 --> 25:29.880
They were just being idiots.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.640
It's fine.

25:31.720 --> 25:34.120
Men who engage in sporting activities
at school

25:34.640 --> 25:38.160
are statistically more likely
to work in menial jobs as adults.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.120
Well, that's a bit harsh.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.160
No, it's realistic.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.880
Look, if your hand doesn't heal,

25:45.760 --> 25:47.160
what is your backup plan?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.760
And even if it does heal,

25:49.840 --> 25:53.000
professional athletes
statistically peak at 21.

25:53.840 --> 25:57.720
So it might be worth
acquiring some other skills.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.840
Statistics are a real buzzkill,
you know that?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.720
Parade, shun!

26:12.280 --> 26:14.320
Slope arms!

26:16.720 --> 26:18.160
General salute!

26:18.960 --> 26:21.800
Present arms!

26:24.920 --> 26:27.280
Slope arms!

26:39.000 --> 26:39.880
That...

26:40.720 --> 26:42.920
is a real improvement, Groff.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.880
To your duties.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.440
Fall out!

26:55.120 --> 26:56.960
-Well done, mate.
- Good job, man.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.920
-We're going on the Ferris wheel.
-Wind isn't good for my hair.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.400
I don't think I was clear.
Rahim's going on the Ferris wheel,

27:08.480 --> 27:10.000
so we're going on the Ferris wheel.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.520
You can squeeze in with me and Anwar
for the next ride, Rahim.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.960
No, thank you.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.040
What do you mean why are we going on it?
It's fun.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.200
It's the least safe
of any of the rides here.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.840
-It's fun.
-How do you know it's fun?

27:22.920 --> 27:25.320
Because I'm telling you that it's fun,
that's how I know.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.040
Oh, I am going to die.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.400
- Come on then.
-I'm coming, I'm coming.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.840
- Ooh!

27:30.920 --> 27:33.160
-What was that? That was really unsafe.
-Calm down.

27:33.240 --> 27:38.160
-Eric. Ahh, I'm sorry. I feel vulnerable.
-Excuse me, Oatcake! Get back here!

27:38.240 --> 27:39.640
It'll be fine, you're fine.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.440
-Hello.
-Hi. Hello.

27:54.040 --> 27:57.200
-Why won't he notice me?
-Do you think they do vegan hotdogs?

28:01.240 --> 28:03.000
Milburn, can I have a word, please?

28:03.080 --> 28:04.000
Um...

28:04.080 --> 28:06.480
It's about your... biology test.

28:07.360 --> 28:09.760
What... What biology test, sir?

28:10.600 --> 28:13.440
It's not really about a test.
There is no test. Listen...

28:13.520 --> 28:18.560
I heard on the grapevine
that you deal with matters of the heart.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.720
And I'm desperate for some advice.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.160
Thing is, I have a friend
who speaks Spanish

28:24.240 --> 28:26.440
and I can't understand her at all.

28:26.520 --> 28:27.880
She says things like, <i>"Hola...</i>

28:30.520 --> 28:33.160
...and... all I can hear is...

28:33.880 --> 28:35.320
Shakira, Shakira.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.560
I don't speak Spanish, sir.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.320
I can't do dirty talk.

28:41.640 --> 28:42.960
I find it mortifying.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Oh...

28:46.200 --> 28:47.400
Well, uh...

28:48.720 --> 28:52.080
sometimes when we learn new skills,
we can feel exposed.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.440
Right? And you wouldn't go
to a foreign country

28:54.520 --> 28:57.880
without some basic understanding
of the language.

28:57.960 --> 29:01.280
So why don't you write a script
for yourself

29:01.360 --> 29:04.280
and practice speaking the words
until they feel more comfortable?

29:05.520 --> 29:08.960
It's about making an effort
to take little steps to meet her halfway.

29:09.920 --> 29:10.960
Does that makes sense?

29:12.200 --> 29:13.120
Yes.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.560
<i>Muchas gracias, maestro.</i>

29:17.560 --> 29:19.800
-What shall we say, a pony?
-Ah... Uh...

29:19.880 --> 29:21.920
-Or a monkey?
-Please don't pay me.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.360
Let's not speak of this again.

29:26.760 --> 29:27.760
You bet.

29:43.760 --> 29:46.160
-So, what are the interesting landmarks...
-Um...

29:46.240 --> 29:47.280
...around here?

29:47.360 --> 29:50.320
There's nothing interesting
to see round here.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.640
Very boring.

29:53.440 --> 29:54.280
Sorry.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.560
Only boring people get bored.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.960
"As if you were on fire from within.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.400
The moon lives
in the lining of your skin."

30:12.200 --> 30:13.160
Uh, pardon?

30:13.920 --> 30:16.560
-It's about finding beauty in the world.
-Oh.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.760
-It's a poem by Pablo Neruda.
-Oh.

30:21.640 --> 30:22.760
I don't know her.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.640
-Goodbye.
-Uh, bye.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.680
I think you're jabbing the duck
too hard, Otis.

30:52.760 --> 30:55.960
Maybe you should just try it
a bit softer...

30:56.600 --> 30:58.320
a bit slower maybe.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.680
Yes! See, I got... See.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.160
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

31:04.600 --> 31:05.680
Ta-da!

31:05.760 --> 31:06.720
For you.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.680
-There you go.
- Tell him.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.880
Okay. Um, thank you.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.520
I need to tell you something.

31:13.600 --> 31:14.600
-Um...
-Sure.

31:15.360 --> 31:16.680
Okay. Uh, I...

31:19.640 --> 31:22.800
Uh, I really, really don't like...

31:26.080 --> 31:26.920
goldfish.

31:27.800 --> 31:28.640
Here you go.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.400
-Yeah.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.360
Okay, thanks.

31:32.440 --> 31:33.480
Yeah.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.600
Hey, do you wanna hang at mine?

31:36.680 --> 31:38.960
-We could, you know...
-No.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.760
I've got loads of homework
that I need to do.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.320
-In fact, I need to go... now.
-Okay.

31:44.400 --> 31:49.320
-But thank you so much for the bear. Dog.
-Thank you for the fish.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.440
Okay, I'll see you.

31:54.840 --> 31:57.520
My friend's boyfriend doesn't know
how to finger her properly.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.280
I'm off duty, sorry.

32:00.360 --> 32:01.720
He's really bad at it.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.440
Tell your friend's boyfriend

32:03.520 --> 32:05.600
to look up something called
the clock technique.

32:05.680 --> 32:08.000
It looks a bit complicated at first,
granted,

32:08.080 --> 32:11.240
but once you get it right,
the results are astounding.

32:11.880 --> 32:12.720
It's you.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.600
You're my friend's boyfriend.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.320
You're bad at fingering.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.640
Please don't tell Ola
I said anything, but...

32:19.040 --> 32:19.920
sort it out?

32:34.960 --> 32:36.400
I'm ready to talk dirty.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.160
I'm gonna do nasty things to you.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.480
-Yeah.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.040
I'm gonna get you so wet.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.560
You're going to feel like
your water just broke.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.240
-What?
-I'm gonna treat you so badly,

32:59.320 --> 33:01.840
you'll be late for work tomorrow
and I'm gonna get you fired,

33:01.920 --> 33:03.440
completely ruin your life.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.160
Wait that's not... Is that right?

33:07.240 --> 33:08.280
Um...

33:12.680 --> 33:14.920
Uh... this isn't working.

33:17.480 --> 33:18.480
Isn't it?

33:31.480 --> 33:33.640
Grab your stuff. Come with us.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.840
Here you go. That'll keep you warm.

33:59.440 --> 34:00.720
Are you homesick yet?

34:01.400 --> 34:03.440
I was proper homesick
when I first got here.

34:04.000 --> 34:04.840
Yeah.

34:05.520 --> 34:08.040
-He used to cry every night for his mummy.
-Did not.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.720
I miss my mum a bit, but...

34:13.240 --> 34:14.600
not my dad though. He's--

34:14.680 --> 34:15.800
An arsehole?

34:16.720 --> 34:18.720
Yep, my dad's a dick too.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.320
My dad's a pussy.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.360
A mean one.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.440
Fuck all the mean dads.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.680
Fuck 'em!

34:31.200 --> 34:32.720
Fuck all the dads.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.040
-You got a girlfriend?
-Yep.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.000
Her name's Aimee.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.360
Big tits.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.000
You a boob or an arse man?

34:47.800 --> 34:49.680
I like elbows.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.000
-I love you.
- Oh, hold on, darling.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.000
I'm not training, Mum.

35:14.080 --> 35:15.680
Got to keep on track.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.440
You'll be swimming again
before you know it.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.360
Well, what if I'm not?

35:21.480 --> 35:24.480
You know, maybe I should get,
like, a new hobby or something.

35:24.960 --> 35:26.520
But your hand is going to heal.

35:27.720 --> 35:28.640
-Yeah.
-Yes?

35:28.720 --> 35:29.760
-Yeah.
-Okay.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.240
Go on.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.880
-Have a good day.
-Yeah, you too.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.600
-Well, what do I do?

35:40.680 --> 35:43.280
You're kind of asking the wrong guy
about fingering, dude.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.360
I don't know. Shit.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.520
For you to read.

35:50.680 --> 35:51.640
Thanks.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.640
Thank you.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.560
First, he looks at me
like he wants to kill me,

36:00.640 --> 36:02.680
then he calls me boring,
and now he's giving me books.

36:02.760 --> 36:05.480
-Maybe he wants to be your friend.
-Or maybe he's a teenage Ted Bundy.

36:05.560 --> 36:06.840
This is serious, okay?

36:06.920 --> 36:10.440
I need to find someone
who understands vaginas.

36:10.520 --> 36:11.400
Your mum.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.960
-I'm being serious.
-No, Otis, your mum is here.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.480
Okay. All right.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.920
Good luck, Fingertron.

36:39.920 --> 36:42.000
I'm branching out. You should audition.

36:42.760 --> 36:45.240
That's not really my thing.

36:45.640 --> 36:46.480
Thanks, though.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.280
But you're acting all the time.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.720
And you'll probably get a sword.

37:04.520 --> 37:05.480
No hats.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.280
Take it to your dorm.

37:08.840 --> 37:09.760
Come on.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.840
I've still got your, uh, hat.

37:19.840 --> 37:22.760
-We're not poofs or anything.
-Yeah, I was thinking about my girlfriend.

37:22.840 --> 37:26.360
And I was thinking of your girlfriend,
you know... with the big tits.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.320
I won't tell anyone.

37:56.280 --> 37:57.680
I need your advice.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.160
I'm pretty...

38:00.720 --> 38:04.680
I'm bad at fingering. Really bad.
And my girlfriend is actively avoiding me.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.040
Please help.

38:07.360 --> 38:08.240
Okay.

38:10.320 --> 38:11.800
But only because I pity you.

38:17.160 --> 38:19.520
-Show me what you did then.
-I was about to eat that.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.040
-You want me to...
-Mm-hmm.

38:29.120 --> 38:30.240
Okay. Um...

38:32.280 --> 38:33.360
Sorry.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.480
Well, I...

38:35.440 --> 38:36.560
I started at...

38:37.440 --> 38:38.560
I started at 12 o'clock...

38:39.200 --> 38:40.760
and went to three o'clock,

38:40.840 --> 38:42.320
and then back down to six.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.320
Oh, it's juicy. And then there was nine.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.200
Congratulations, you can tell the time.

38:47.920 --> 38:52.080
Then I carried on, clockwise,
then I flipped it anti-clockwise.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.720
So you DJ-ed on her vag.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.240
What's with the clock thing?

38:55.720 --> 38:57.280
-It's a technique.
-It's weird.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.400
Continue.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.600
Well, I sort of continued that motion...

39:03.680 --> 39:05.160
Oh, then I had a spread,

39:05.240 --> 39:07.560
which was kind of like that. That's...

39:07.640 --> 39:11.400
-And continued to apply pressure, and--
-Stop jabbing.

39:11.480 --> 39:14.760
-It's not, I'm not really jabbing.
-I think I'd know, it's my orange.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.520
-Actually, it's my orange.
-Shh.

39:16.600 --> 39:17.560
Okay, um...

39:17.640 --> 39:20.920
-This is ridiculous. I'm sorry.
-Look...

39:23.600 --> 39:26.280
there's no magic technique that works
with all women.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.280
Every orange is different,

39:29.360 --> 39:32.960
but you shouldn't be asking me,
you should be asking your girlfriend.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.760
Tune into her orange.

39:35.320 --> 39:36.280
Yeah.

39:37.240 --> 39:38.360
Okay, we're done now.

39:40.280 --> 39:41.320
Thank you.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.840
Okay, everyone.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.520
It's SRE question time.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.560
Okay?

39:59.440 --> 40:02.320
In the old box, and... Ah!

40:03.440 --> 40:05.680
It doesn't matter.

40:06.880 --> 40:07.880
Okay.

40:08.960 --> 40:12.840
"Can I get pregnant
from only giving hand jobs?"

40:14.880 --> 40:16.560
Okay, um...

40:16.640 --> 40:21.920
Well, fertilization only occurs
when Mr. Sperm enters Mrs. Egg.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
So, no is the answer.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.240
Okay...

40:28.840 --> 40:29.720
Good.

40:30.480 --> 40:31.600
Um...

40:32.520 --> 40:34.920
"My boyfriend
doesn't want to wear a condom.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.240
What should I do?"

40:37.760 --> 40:39.760
Uh... Hell.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.960
Condoms protect the egg
from fertilization.

40:43.520 --> 40:44.880
-Okay.
<i>-Monsieur,</i>

40:44.960 --> 40:46.520
what about gay sex?

40:47.320 --> 40:51.200
Well, you can't get pregnant
from, um, homosexual activity.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.840
But what about pleasure?

40:53.360 --> 40:55.720
People don't always have sex
to make a baby.

40:56.640 --> 40:57.880
Mm. Um...

41:00.440 --> 41:02.280
Where was I? The, uh... The egg--

41:02.360 --> 41:06.760
What type of lubricant would you recommend
for doing anal sex?

41:10.400 --> 41:12.640
Well, you should always use
a water-based lubricant.

41:12.720 --> 41:17.280
Oil-based products will decompose
the latex in the condom.

41:18.800 --> 41:22.560
And, sorry, just to answer
the previous question,

41:22.640 --> 41:25.760
no matter how persistent
a sexual partner is

41:25.840 --> 41:28.520
about not using contraception,

41:29.120 --> 41:33.320
remember it is always your right
to say no.

41:33.760 --> 41:34.720
Always.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.240
Cool.

41:40.640 --> 41:41.720
Uh, Ms. Milburn?

41:42.400 --> 41:44.760
Has that given you enough information
for your report then?

41:44.840 --> 41:48.080
Well, quite frankly, Mr. Groff,
I'm shocked by the ineptitude.

41:48.920 --> 41:51.360
I'll be spending the next few weeks
getting to know the students

41:51.440 --> 41:52.800
and their needs a bit better.

41:52.880 --> 41:54.560
I'm not sure the board will agree
to anything that drastic.

41:54.640 --> 41:58.000
I've already spoken to Maxine Tarrington,
and she approves.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.720
I'm looking forward
to working with you, Mr. Groff.

42:08.240 --> 42:09.760
Oh, for God's sake!

42:12.760 --> 42:17.520
Did you know you need, like,
sugar and flour and an oven to bake?

42:17.600 --> 42:21.520
And you don't just shove it all in,
you have to follow all these rules.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.040
Yeah, it's called a recipe.

42:23.120 --> 42:26.080
Hey, Maeve,
you're our new Quiz Head. High five.

42:27.840 --> 42:28.920
Don't let me down.

42:30.320 --> 42:33.040
Hey, have you guys...
Have you seen Ola anywhere?

42:34.080 --> 42:37.440
-Maeve got on the quiz team.
-Oh, good job.

42:37.520 --> 42:39.520
If you see Ola, I'm looking for her.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.240
Are you happy, babes?

42:45.440 --> 42:46.960
I don't think I'm over Otis.

42:48.320 --> 42:50.040
That is what I keep saying.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.320
Oh, my God! Your mum is everyting.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.760
She talked about anal sex
in front of Mr. Groff.

43:01.840 --> 43:05.600
-Jean actually gives me life.
-That's not good news, Eric.

43:05.680 --> 43:08.640
Oh, and I think Rahim is gay.

43:10.560 --> 43:13.120
-That actually makes a ton of sense.
-Mm-hmm.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.400
Staring at you,
wanting to sit next to you all the time,

43:15.480 --> 43:17.040
giving you books. He probably likes you.

43:17.120 --> 43:18.200
Otis, I don't think so.

43:18.280 --> 43:20.840
Read the signs, Eric. I have to go.

43:35.160 --> 43:40.600
Sir! I was wrong. I was wrong.
You have to tune into <i>her </i>orange.

43:40.680 --> 43:44.960
Just listen to what she's actually saying.
That's how you learn Spanish, huh?

43:46.400 --> 43:47.360
Good luck!

43:51.720 --> 43:52.760
It's an apple.

44:03.640 --> 44:04.480
Hi.

44:05.720 --> 44:06.920
I know I'm bad at fingering.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.680
I was really busy trying to get it right,
and I wasn't listening to you.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.960
We don't ever have to do it again.

44:16.720 --> 44:17.640
Or...

44:18.400 --> 44:19.640
I could show you what I like?

44:36.120 --> 44:40.520
Could you explain why you enjoy dirty talk
so that I can understand?

44:41.080 --> 44:42.880
If not, I bought dips.

44:45.320 --> 44:46.240
Loads of them.

44:53.880 --> 44:57.080
I feel like a dowdy teacher all day, so...

44:57.760 --> 45:00.800
when I'm at home,
I want to escape and to feel...

45:02.480 --> 45:03.720
Like a female dog?

45:03.800 --> 45:04.960
No.

45:05.040 --> 45:07.160
Colin, I don't care what you say.

45:07.720 --> 45:08.600
I just...

45:09.640 --> 45:10.840
want to feel sexy.

45:14.840 --> 45:16.400

45:23.120 --> 45:24.240
