Quincy, get up!

03:05.728 --> 03:08.168
It's after 7:00, and you're going to be
late for school again!

03:11.651 --> 03:14.861
Quincy Powell, did you hear me?
I said get up.

03:14.946 --> 03:16.526
Bullshit.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.624
Excuse me, young man,
what did you say?

03:18.700 --> 03:21.790
- Nothin', Ma.
- That's what I thought. Get up.

03:45.643 --> 03:48.353
Gerard, Eric, time to get up!

03:59.741 --> 04:02.201
Come on, man, move it, man.
Move your fat feet, man.

04:02.285 --> 04:05.035
You're too fat to be smelling bad, man.

04:05.121 --> 04:07.541
Come on, man, you gonna
never get anywhere but... Stop!

04:12.045 --> 04:13.755
No! You little bitch!

04:16.048 --> 04:18.009
Boy, didn't I tell you
to get your rusty butt up?

04:18.176 --> 04:19.716
I'm up, Pop. I'm up.

04:19.844 --> 04:21.894
- And do something about this room!
- Sure thing.

04:29.145 --> 04:31.015
Fatness never Prospereth.

04:38.279 --> 04:42.279
- Morning, Grandma.
- Oh, morning, baby. Breakfast is ready.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.697
See if your father's hungry!

05:01.719 --> 05:04.309
<i>You can't do it, John Henry!</i>

05:04.389 --> 05:06.219
<i>I have to!</i>

05:08.726 --> 05:11.186
Raheem, you know
I got a job interview this morning.

05:11.270 --> 05:14.610
Let me in. Come on, I'm late as is.

05:14.691 --> 05:17.321
Raheem, let me in the bathroom!

05:19.028 --> 05:21.818
- How much?
- How much what?

05:21.906 --> 05:23.746
How much you willing
to give me to get in here?

05:23.825 --> 05:26.325
Fuck you, Raheem! I ain't givin' you shit!

05:26.411 --> 05:28.661
Raheem, let me in. I'll give you $1.

05:33.584 --> 05:36.844
Quincy, I was talking to Louise
that lives down the hall in 4-A.

05:36.921 --> 05:38.841
She was telling me
that her boy, Tyrone...

05:38.923 --> 05:41.803
You know Tyrone, that tall, skinny boy?
Nice kid.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.444
She was telling me that he's looking
to get into the Acme school,

05:44.512 --> 05:46.615
you know, that school where
they teach you to fix cars

05:46.639 --> 05:48.679
and washing machines
and stereos and whatnot.

05:48.766 --> 05:50.646
Quincy, you can make
some good money doing that.

05:50.727 --> 05:51.847
Are you listening to me?

05:51.936 --> 05:55.726
I'll give you $5, Raheem. Now let me in.

05:55.815 --> 05:58.355
- Did you say $5?
- Yes, I did.

05:58.443 --> 06:00.113
Cool. $5. I'm with that.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.164
Look at you, baby.
Have you been working out?

06:02.238 --> 06:04.948
- You look nice. You look real fine.
- Really?

06:05.033 --> 06:07.203
I'll give it to you later.

06:07.285 --> 06:09.365
Myra, you better give me my $5!

06:09.454 --> 06:12.254
- What's going on out here?
- Nothin', Ma.

06:58.961 --> 07:02.381
<i>Puppy, oh, puppy, speak to me.</i>

07:02.465 --> 07:04.545
<i>Good ol' doggy. Nice puppy.</i>

07:04.634 --> 07:07.434
<i>Oh, you poor thing.</i>

07:07.512 --> 07:09.562
Take it easy, Pop.

07:09.639 --> 07:11.809
Get outta here.
Button up your coat. It's cold out.

07:11.891 --> 07:13.744
And don't be coming back here
all hours of the night.

07:13.768 --> 07:14.808
I won't.

07:14.894 --> 07:17.864
And clean up that room, boy,
or it's gonna be me and you.

07:29.951 --> 07:32.596
You can't play that music
for the rest of your life, you know.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.210
What time are you coming home?

07:38.626 --> 07:41.456
And you're not going in the army either.
Remember that.

07:41.546 --> 07:43.706
Quincy, where are your books?

07:43.798 --> 07:45.984
Yo, man. What's up, Lenny, man?
Better hurry that ass up.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.468
Mrs. Sanders ain't going
for that late shit no more.

07:48.553 --> 07:50.893
Yo, man, I need those notes
for biology class.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.313
If I flunk, I'm gonna
have to kick your ass.

07:53.391 --> 07:55.431
Ooh, I'm sorry. Damn, baby, what's up?

07:55.518 --> 07:57.398
- Can I get that number?
- Eric!

07:57.478 --> 07:59.398
Eric, come back here
and make up your bed!

07:59.480 --> 08:00.980
- Damn!
- Busted!

08:05.403 --> 08:06.783
Yo, Raheem!

08:09.532 --> 08:11.162
Yo, Raheem!

08:15.580 --> 08:17.870
Keesha. Keesha, wait.

08:18.583 --> 08:21.623
Come on. I didn't come out here to
argue with you. I'm so tired of that shit.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.799
What the fuck do you
want then, Raheem?

08:23.880 --> 08:26.510
I ain't got all day.
I gotta take the baby to the sitter.

08:26.591 --> 08:28.841
But I could help with that.
That's my baby, too.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.926
- If we got back together...
- Get real, Raheem.

08:31.012 --> 08:33.142
I ain't even about to
let you have my baby

08:33.222 --> 08:35.022
so you can have him hangin' out
in the streets

08:35.099 --> 08:36.599
with you and your fucked-up friends.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.193
Getting into all kinds of shit.

08:38.269 --> 08:40.229
Oh, yeah. And how would
Charlene feel about that?

08:40.313 --> 08:43.363
How many times I gotta tell you?
I ain't messin' with Charlene no more.

08:44.025 --> 08:45.895
Raheem, you ain't even foolin' nobody.

08:45.985 --> 08:48.445
Everybody knows.
It's all over the school.

08:48.613 --> 08:51.533
I don't have time. You can come back
and talk to me when you're serious.

08:51.616 --> 08:52.866
Well, I'm serious now.

08:52.950 --> 08:55.910
Well, I'm serious, too, Raheem!
And this does not make you a man.

08:55.995 --> 08:58.115
I need a real man, Raheem.

08:58.206 --> 09:00.576
I'm not letting my child
grow up to be fucked up

09:00.666 --> 09:02.876
like you and your stupid-ass friends.

09:04.629 --> 09:06.259
Yeah, well, fuck you, then.

09:06.339 --> 09:10.469
Because I don't need
your tired ass anyway, bitch.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.091
That was real smooth, man.

09:12.178 --> 09:14.888
I'm squashin' her.
That shit is too much work.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.642
I should've let you have her.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.814
Don't you remember? I let you have her.

09:19.310 --> 09:21.810
- Just buggin', man. What's up?
- Yeah. I thought so.

09:24.357 --> 09:26.277
Yo, Bishop!

09:27.860 --> 09:29.820
What you want?

09:31.530 --> 09:33.200
Your ass, punk!

09:34.242 --> 09:37.872
People been saying
that you say you can bust my ass.

09:38.704 --> 09:41.674
- You believe that shit?
- So?

09:44.710 --> 09:47.340
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.341
Smile, man, smile. See this?

09:50.424 --> 09:53.094
Take a real good look at him,

09:53.177 --> 09:55.847
'cause that's how
a dumb nigga commits suicide.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.598
You think your shit is that bad, man?

10:00.685 --> 10:02.185
You got that much juice?

10:02.270 --> 10:05.820
Goddamn right.
Don't nobody fuck with me.

10:05.898 --> 10:08.108
'Cause you already fucked up, man.

10:08.192 --> 10:10.532
You can't fuck up something
that's already fucked up.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.161
Man, if you wasn't
as fucked up as you are...

10:13.239 --> 10:15.569
You see that shit, man?

10:15.658 --> 10:18.158
Some nigga, man.
What a dumb nigga, man.

10:18.244 --> 10:20.874
Fuck you, you beans and rice
son of a bitch!

10:20.955 --> 10:22.182
You need to have respect for me.

10:22.206 --> 10:25.036
I was almost your father,
but the line was too fucking long!

10:25.126 --> 10:29.166
Hey, hey, it's cool, man. It's cool.

10:29.255 --> 10:31.965
Now, Raheem, man,
you better tell your boy somethin', man,

10:32.049 --> 10:34.179
'cause I don't care if he's crazy or not.

10:34.885 --> 10:37.095
I'll stomp the shit out of his ass.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.059
You ain't saying nothin' but a word.

10:39.140 --> 10:40.730
Yo, man, it's just bullshit, man.

10:40.808 --> 10:41.978
He didn't mean it.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.559
Shit if I didn't mean it.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.814
Fuck that little Puerto Rican <i>Maricón.</i>

10:45.896 --> 10:47.226
<i>Maricón? Maricón?</i>

10:47.315 --> 10:50.460
Man, if you're looking for faggots, you
ain't gotta look no farther than your pa.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.904
My boys be telling me
he likes being a prison yard ho!

10:53.988 --> 10:56.118
Fuck you, motherfucker!

10:56.407 --> 10:58.657
Break it up.

10:58.743 --> 11:00.203
Stay away from my store,

11:00.286 --> 11:01.826
I'm warning you.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.432
I'm gonna shoot your pee pee off, man.

11:08.336 --> 11:11.336
- Tell me that wasn't just sick!
- You're crazy, man.

11:11.422 --> 11:13.400
- Ain't had no fun like that in a while.
- Nigga is crazy.

11:13.424 --> 11:16.054
- Get outta here.
- It was great.

11:16.135 --> 11:18.045
That nigga had you
all up by your neck and shit.

11:18.137 --> 11:19.757
I swear to God...

11:19.847 --> 11:21.887
What's up, fat chops?

11:21.974 --> 11:24.944
- What's up, man?
- Hey, how you doin'?

11:25.019 --> 11:27.519
- You're late, man.
- I feel good.

11:27.605 --> 11:31.065
Sorry, man. I was busy, man.
I had a hard time gettin' away, man.

11:31.150 --> 11:32.990
If you give those chubby palms a rest,

11:33.069 --> 11:34.789
you can get here
with the rest of us, buddy.

11:34.987 --> 11:36.923
Can I tell y'all why I'm really late?

11:36.947 --> 11:38.317
No, why you really late?

11:38.407 --> 11:40.657
I was doin' the hootchy-kootchy
with Donna Bromwell.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.536
Oh, so, you boned Donna Bromwell?

11:44.622 --> 11:46.252
Yeah, man. She liked it, too.

11:46.332 --> 11:48.712
My man, finally got that ass.
I heard that.

11:48.793 --> 11:51.213
Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.

11:51.295 --> 11:52.455
So, how was it, man?

11:52.546 --> 11:54.756
Yeah, it was good.
What do you think, man?

11:54.840 --> 11:57.430
I could believe that. I heard
Donna Bromwell was a real freak.

11:57.510 --> 12:00.550
She is a real freak.
The bitch tried to fuck me on the stove.

12:00.638 --> 12:03.098
Hey, uh, she still got that, uh, tattoo?

12:03.224 --> 12:06.144
No, man. I wasn't lookin' for no tattoo.

12:06.227 --> 12:10.557
I was doin' the hootchy-kootchy,
my friend.

12:10.648 --> 12:13.248
You could tell it was Donna
from all that hair on her face, right?

12:13.275 --> 12:15.355
- What?
- Yeah, man, come on.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.614
You didn't know
about Donna Bromwell, man?

12:17.696 --> 12:19.236
What, man, what?

12:19.323 --> 12:22.743
That she used to be Donald Bromwell?

12:24.662 --> 12:27.462
- Don Juan.
- Fuck you all, man!

12:27.540 --> 12:30.580
Come here, big, hefty,
tub-of-a-man you!

12:30.668 --> 12:32.128
Don't make me come after you!

12:32.670 --> 12:35.210
Get the fuck off me!

12:35.506 --> 12:36.626
My man.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.675
- You big fathead jalopy.
- You gotta stop that lyin'!

12:40.261 --> 12:41.261
'Reckin' crew!

12:43.806 --> 12:45.575
I hope you're feelin'
lucky today, my brother,

12:45.599 --> 12:47.519
'cause I'm getting ready
to bust your ass.

12:48.811 --> 12:51.111
Look, look, look.
What you want me to do? Lie to you?

12:51.188 --> 12:52.938
Just because you pour syrup on shit

12:53.023 --> 12:54.626
don't make it pancakes.
You know what I'm saying?

12:54.650 --> 12:56.820
- Q!
- What's up?

12:56.902 --> 13:00.162
What's happenin'?
You got that party tape for me, man?

13:00.239 --> 13:01.739
Yeah. I got it.

13:01.824 --> 13:04.664
My brother, my brother,
my brother, my brother.

13:04.743 --> 13:05.793
Yo, bad news, though.

13:05.870 --> 13:09.790
Being that we in a recession and all,
the shit's gonna cost $15 instead of 10.

13:09.874 --> 13:11.464
- $15?
- $15.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.707
Hit the button! Hit the button!

13:15.713 --> 13:17.723
Kiss? Money?
What you gonna do, sweetheart?

13:17.798 --> 13:18.878
I ain't got all day.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.256
Do what you're told. Give me a kiss.
Yeah, I knew it.

13:22.261 --> 13:24.761
Yo, was the last party serious?
You know what I'm saying?

13:24.847 --> 13:26.241
- It was slammin'?
- It was all right.

13:26.265 --> 13:27.635
People liked the music?

13:27.725 --> 13:30.225
It was dope, right?
Yo, did you hit Brenda's skins?

13:30.311 --> 13:31.481
What?

13:31.562 --> 13:33.312
Did Brenda Witherspoon
shine your silver?

13:33.397 --> 13:35.357
My mother shines the silver
in my house, G.

13:35.441 --> 13:37.991
All you could see was
that number one thing, that butt.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.148
I don't even know
why you thought that was so tough.

13:40.237 --> 13:42.027
'Cause she got
the Snappy Nappy Dugout.

13:42.114 --> 13:43.914
- Snappy Nappy Dugout?
- Snappy Nappy Dugout.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.242
Did you fuck Brenda Witherspoon?

13:49.121 --> 13:51.961
- Yeah, I did, man.
- Yeah? You did, right?

13:52.583 --> 13:53.833
$15, G.

13:53.918 --> 13:56.588
Lord, I came at the perfect time.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.510
Pop two quarters in,
Pop-Tart, and let's get it on.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.010
Let me get in that ass.

14:01.091 --> 14:04.681
What makes you think
you can beat me?

14:04.762 --> 14:07.352
- Tell me. I would like to know.
- Two reasons.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.601
For one, if I lose,
I'm going to beat that ass.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.733
For two, if I lose,
I'm going to beat that ass.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.810
So, if you don't put
two motherfucking quarters in

14:13.896 --> 14:15.856
and get this goddamn game started...

14:15.940 --> 14:17.918
- Bring it on! Come on.
- Tugboat-ass motherfucker.

14:17.942 --> 14:19.169
- Fat bastard.
- What's up? What's up?

14:19.193 --> 14:20.837
- What you got? Hey.
- I'm gonna beat that fat ass.

14:20.861 --> 14:21.861
Hey.

14:24.865 --> 14:25.945
Hey, here they come!

14:26.033 --> 14:28.203
They gonna put your asses
back in school!

14:28.285 --> 14:30.195
Hey. What's up? What's up? Outta there.

14:31.830 --> 14:34.460
Steel, come on!
Steel, come the fuck on!

14:35.167 --> 14:36.957
Hey, what the fuck?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.380
- Go!
- See ya!

14:39.463 --> 14:41.673
Out back.
They're going through the back.

14:43.634 --> 14:46.684
Bam! Kick! You're out of there.

15:41.859 --> 15:43.239
Stop!

15:44.361 --> 15:47.071

You can't play with this, yo, yo.

Stupid bitch!

16:28.072 --> 16:29.822
Yo, he ain't coming. Let's go.

16:29.907 --> 16:31.947
We ain't goin' nowhere without Steel.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.244
Fat fuck...

16:36.497 --> 16:39.287

- Yo, what time is it?
- Almost 12:00.

17:09.613 --> 17:12.282
How much money we make
at the arcade today?

17:12.449 --> 17:15.868
Uh, I can count!

17:15.953 --> 17:17.252
25.

17:17.329 --> 17:19.499
All right. Bad.
Let's go chill out somewhere.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.376
Yo! Yo, you see this shit?
Check this shit out.

17:24.461 --> 17:28.221
I was tellin' you all about this.
This shit is mine, word up.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.298
We gotta worry
about runnin' into Radames,

17:30.384 --> 17:33.144
and this nigga talking about
some bullshit-ass DJ contest.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.447
What do you mean bullshit, man?

17:34.471 --> 17:37.561
Yo, first prize is custom gold 1200s.

17:37.683 --> 17:39.661
And a six-month contract
to Deejay at the Ruffhouse.

17:39.685 --> 17:41.413
Yo, it's better than running
around with you Niggas

17:41.437 --> 17:43.647
with this pool hall
nickel and dime bullshit.

17:43.731 --> 17:45.691
Yo, DJ Plaz, DJ Rich E. Rich,

17:45.774 --> 17:48.074
Pete Rock, and DJ Scratch

17:48.152 --> 17:49.742
- So what?
- So,

17:49.820 --> 17:52.110
they're the ones
who won both the contests last year.

17:52.322 --> 17:54.952
That was at Hott Boxx, yo.
Anybody could have won in that shit.

17:55.033 --> 17:57.053
We talkin' 'bout the Ruffhouse,
you know what I'm saying?

17:57.077 --> 17:58.221
The comp is gonna be serious.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.806
You know there ain't
no greater comp than me.

17:59.830 --> 18:01.670
Oh! Oh!

18:01.749 --> 18:05.839
Y'all ain't got no confidence in me now?
Y'all supposed to be my boys. The crew.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.919
Wake up, man.
They been all over, man.

18:08.005 --> 18:10.045
Everybody know them. You just local.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.012
Local?

18:12.217 --> 18:13.587
I'm just local now. Yeah.

18:13.719 --> 18:15.799
Yo, kiss my local ass,
you know what I'm saying?

18:16.138 --> 18:18.388
All right. Come on, Q.

18:18.474 --> 18:20.524
You're still my favorite local deejay.

18:20.601 --> 18:22.954
Yeah, well, I'm gonna pick up
some party tapes from the Record Rack

18:22.978 --> 18:24.188
for my audition tape.

18:24.271 --> 18:27.481
- That's all right with you, Raheem?
- Yeah, man. That's all right with me.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.947
Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:14.404 --> 19:15.704
Hi. Can I help you?

19:19.451 --> 19:21.081
Uh, yeah.

19:21.995 --> 19:27.205
Let me get EPMD's new album,
and your name and your phone number.

19:27.292 --> 19:30.592
Oh! Okay. I can get you the tape.

19:30.671 --> 19:32.261
And you want my name and my number?

19:32.381 --> 19:33.801
Yeah.

19:33.882 --> 19:36.182
Okay, here's my name.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.260
It's Juaniqua Ross.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.595
And here's my number.

19:45.769 --> 19:47.413
Why don't you put
your address on there?

19:47.437 --> 19:49.147
Oh, okay.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.209
Does this mean we're going out
and you're picking me up?

19:51.233 --> 19:52.943
Yeah.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.526
- You got three friends?
- Yeah.

19:55.612 --> 19:56.702
Who look just like you?

19:56.780 --> 19:59.092
I don't know.
I'm kind of one of a kind, you know?

19:59.116 --> 20:02.906
- What's your name?
- My name is, um, Ed.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.326
- Ed?
- Yeah, Eddie.

20:04.538 --> 20:06.307
Eddie, okay.
So, you going to call me?

20:06.331 --> 20:08.711
- Put that shit back.
- When should I phone?

20:08.792 --> 20:11.882
Anytime.
Anytime you want. Uh-huh.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.296
You know, you are sexy.

20:14.882 --> 20:16.802
Thank you. Okay.

20:16.884 --> 20:18.403
That's a gold tooth
in your mouth? I like it.

20:18.427 --> 20:19.677
- You like it?
- Yeah.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.364
- I'm going to get another one.
- Oh, really?

20:21.388 --> 20:23.218
Yeah. I want to cover up the whole front.

20:23.307 --> 20:25.637
When are we going out, Saturday?

20:25.809 --> 20:27.059
I don't know.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.309
Sir? Sir!

20:29.396 --> 20:32.016
- Sir, can I check that newspaper?
- So, can I call you tonight?

20:32.107 --> 20:35.527
Wait a second. Sir!
Sir, where are you going?

20:35.611 --> 20:39.321
Give back my tape! You can't leave.
I'm not paying for this tape, you know.

20:39.406 --> 20:42.406
It's not Christmas.
Get a job, why don't you?

20:50.167 --> 20:52.417
All right, man, yo, I'm hungry.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.252
Let's go someplace,
get something to eat.

20:54.338 --> 20:56.628
Yo, let's go to Steel's house.
His moms ain't home.

20:56.715 --> 20:59.635
- Taxi! Taxi!
- What she got in the refrigerator?

20:59.718 --> 21:01.888
She still got them turkey wings?
Turkey wings?

21:01.970 --> 21:03.720
No, man. She ain't been shoppin', man.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.765
Well, I believe we need
to go over to your crib

21:05.849 --> 21:07.639
- and just see what's in the fridge.
- Yeah.

21:09.186 --> 21:10.226
Hi.

21:10.312 --> 21:13.072
Yo, Q, man,
go in and get me some cigarettes.

21:13.148 --> 21:14.398
Why I gotta go get them?

21:14.483 --> 21:17.493
'Cause it's your turn, motherfucker!
Now, go on.

21:17.569 --> 21:19.213
- Hold on, I'll go...
- I got it. I got it.

21:19.237 --> 21:23.527
- Oh, man. That's cold.
- Lucky son of a...

21:56.692 --> 22:00.032
Blizz, man, what's up, man?
What's going on? It's Q.

22:00.112 --> 22:01.452
Yo, what's up, Q, man?

22:01.530 --> 22:03.330
How you doing, man?
It's good to see you, man.

22:03.407 --> 22:04.987
I'm all right, man. How's your crew?

22:05.075 --> 22:06.235
They outside waiting.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.179
Yo, what's up with you?
When you got paroled, man?

22:08.203 --> 22:10.163
Yo, man,
I just got paroled the other day, man.

22:10.247 --> 22:12.976
That shit is cool, man. I hope
you're taking care of yourself, word up.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.500
Come on, man, it's Blizz.
Of course I'm taking care of myself.

22:15.585 --> 22:16.875
It's nice to see you, man.

22:16.962 --> 22:19.342
Yeah, pardon me for a second.
I'm about to rob this place.

22:19.423 --> 22:24.183
All right, everybody, put your hands
in the air and face the fucking bar!

22:24.261 --> 22:25.721
Oh, shit!

22:25.804 --> 22:29.564
Don't look at me, God damn it!
Hey, yo, Q, you want a piece of this?

22:30.392 --> 22:32.142
No, man. I'm all right.

22:32.227 --> 22:35.517
All right, everybody, strip!

22:35.605 --> 22:37.685
Take your fucking clothes off!

22:38.734 --> 22:41.284
Hurry up, God damn it,
'cause you look good!

22:42.404 --> 22:44.874
As fat as you are,
there ain't no food in the house?

22:44.948 --> 22:46.092
Yeah,
she's going shopping tonight.

22:46.116 --> 22:47.366
We can go over there tomorrow.

22:47.451 --> 22:50.621
No, we're going today. Ah, thank you.

22:50.704 --> 22:54.794
Yo, Blizzard is in there right now
stickin' the place up.

22:54.875 --> 22:57.085
- Word, right now?
- He let you out?

22:57.169 --> 22:59.379
Nigga asked me
if I wanted a piece of the action.

22:59.463 --> 23:01.553
- And you said no?
- Hell, yeah, I said no.

23:01.631 --> 23:03.971
What is you? Crazy? Let me in there.

23:04.051 --> 23:06.641
I don't think so.
Let me tell you something right now.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.720
That crazy motherfucker is goin' down.

23:08.805 --> 23:11.925
I'm making for goddamn sure
that none of us is goin' with him.

23:12.017 --> 23:15.397
You know how much money is in there?
We are in there, man. Let's just go.

23:15.479 --> 23:19.399
I said no, man!
That shit is out. Now come on.

23:23.820 --> 23:26.320
Come on, man. Come on, man.

23:48.053 --> 23:49.683
I thought that was your woman.

23:51.348 --> 23:53.058
Man, what you gonna do?

24:04.402 --> 24:05.952
Steel's kitchen.

24:09.324 --> 24:10.834
Almost empty.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.246
Mmm!

24:20.210 --> 24:22.210
Gotta get it right, buddy.

24:30.929 --> 24:33.099
All right, there he goes.
There he goes.

24:33.181 --> 24:34.851
Bust 'em! Bust 'em!

24:34.933 --> 24:37.393
Boo-yah! Boo-yah! Boo-yah!

24:37.936 --> 24:40.226
Pow! Boo-yah! Aw, shit!

24:41.273 --> 24:42.613
Word.

24:47.445 --> 24:50.985
Damn, Steel.
What the fuck is this mess, man?

24:51.074 --> 24:54.584
Bacon and eggs and hot sauce, man.
I mix it like this all the time.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.458
I'm too hungry
to throw this shit away.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.170
<i>But I only did it for you, Ed.</i>

25:02.836 --> 25:05.506
<i>Cody still ain't gonna like to
hear that she got it in the back.</i>

25:05.589 --> 25:08.219
Oh, shit! Shot his moms in the back.

25:08.300 --> 25:11.220
Yo, Steel, man, why don't you let me
borrow these two till tomorrow.

25:11.303 --> 25:12.513
This shit is dope.

25:12.596 --> 25:14.846
Excuse me, partner,
can you keep that shit down?

25:14.931 --> 25:16.601
You see we watching TV.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.091
<i>Made it, Ma!
Top of the world!</i>

25:32.115 --> 25:33.551
"Made it, Ma! Top of the world!"

25:33.575 --> 25:36.365
Top of the world! Yo!

25:40.040 --> 25:42.540
If you gotta go out,
that's how you go out.

25:42.626 --> 25:45.956
That motherfucker
took his destiny in his own hands.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.304
Mmm, some destiny.

25:47.464 --> 25:48.924
What you know about it, big chops?

25:49.216 --> 25:52.796
- What you ever control?
- I control my life.

25:53.094 --> 25:54.304
That's bullshit.

25:54.387 --> 25:56.467
I got more control
over your life than you do.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.270
How you figure that?

25:58.350 --> 26:00.020
I'm lettin' you breathe, ain't I?

26:00.352 --> 26:03.062
You can't even walk
your own block

26:03.146 --> 26:04.936
without getting fucked up by Radames,

26:05.023 --> 26:06.573
let's not forget.

26:07.651 --> 26:09.441
Oh, shit! It's Blizzard!

26:10.320 --> 26:12.740
<i>A gunman was killed
in a shootout with police</i>

26:12.822 --> 26:15.122
<i>as he attempted to rob
the Harlem Wood bar in Harlem</i>

26:15.200 --> 26:17.040
<i>just under an hour ago.</i>

26:17.118 --> 26:20.208
<i>The gunman, identified as
20-year-old Barnett Jenkins,</i>

26:20.288 --> 26:23.168
<i>wounded two officers
before he himself was killed.</i>

26:23.250 --> 26:25.630
<i>On the news at 7:00,
we'll have more on this story,</i>

26:25.794 --> 26:27.354
<i>as well as an update on the campaign...</i>

26:27.504 --> 26:29.924
Yo, man, we was just down there.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.859
<i>To have the already
financially strapped city</i>

26:31.883 --> 26:34.933
<i>provide more police protection
on the subway els after dark.</i>

26:43.019 --> 26:46.439
- Where are you going, man?
- Go get him, man!

26:46.523 --> 26:48.443
- Fucking Radames.
- Fuck that shit, man.

26:51.278 --> 26:52.698
We ain't shit.

26:54.030 --> 26:57.030
- Man, what's your problem?
- You're my fucking problem!

26:57.742 --> 27:00.412
People sweat us on the street
and you don't even give a fuck!

27:01.288 --> 27:04.578
- I think you're exaggerating.
- That's bullshit, man!

27:04.666 --> 27:07.246
We run from the cops.
We run from Radames.

27:07.335 --> 27:08.795
We run from security guards.

27:08.878 --> 27:11.968
We run from old man Quiles
and his fucking bullshit store

27:12.048 --> 27:14.298
when he come with that bullshit gun.

27:14.384 --> 27:16.804
All we do is fucking run!

27:16.928 --> 27:18.598
I feel like I'm on
the goddamn track team.

27:18.722 --> 27:20.432
I'm serious!

27:21.808 --> 27:23.808
What's the matter, Raheem?
Nothin' to say?

27:27.063 --> 27:28.523
That's 'cause you know I'm right.

27:28.606 --> 27:30.026
In your heart, you know I'm right.

27:30.108 --> 27:33.108
Yo, big man!
If you want respect, you gotta earn it.

27:33.236 --> 27:35.986
You damn right!
You gotta be ready to go down,

27:36.072 --> 27:39.912
stand up, and die for that shit like
Blizzard did if you want some juice.

27:39.993 --> 27:42.543
Blizzard? Blizzard ain't
stickin' up to nothin' now.

27:42.620 --> 27:45.140
That's 'cause we wasn't there
to back him up! If we was there...

27:45.206 --> 27:48.206
If we was there, there'd be
five dead Niggas instead of one!

27:50.128 --> 27:52.508
You ain't saying nothin' now,
right, big man?

27:52.756 --> 27:56.126
Never thought I'd see the day
when you talk like a fucking punk, Q.

27:56.217 --> 27:57.257
Fuck you, man.

27:57.344 --> 28:00.644
- Yo, chill!
- Yo, fuck chill! Check yourself, Q.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.352
You gotta snatch some collars
and let them motherfuckers know

28:03.433 --> 28:07.233
you're there to take them out
anytime you feel like it.

28:07.312 --> 28:09.612
You gotta get the ground
beneath your feet, partner,

28:09.689 --> 28:12.359
get the wind behind your back,
and go out in a blaze if you got to.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.435
Otherwise, you ain't shit.

28:14.611 --> 28:17.071
You might as well be dead
your damn self.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.091
You trying to tell me I ain't shit?

28:19.115 --> 28:21.785
I ain't trying to tell you shit.

28:21.868 --> 28:24.158
I tell your mama you ain't shit.

28:26.998 --> 28:29.128
Yo, man, what are we fightin' for?

28:29.376 --> 28:31.086
I don't know, nigga. You ready to die?

28:32.504 --> 28:33.804
You're fucked up, man.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.670
Don't turn your fucking
back on me, nigga!

28:36.633 --> 28:39.683
You broke the fucking vase, man!

28:39.761 --> 28:43.851
What the fuck is y'all doin', man?
Damn, man. What the fuck?

28:43.932 --> 28:46.432
- Stop messin' up my shit, man!
- Come on, man, chill.

28:46.518 --> 28:48.808
- Feed y'all! Watch TV!
- Sorry, man. Here!

28:48.895 --> 28:52.565
Fuck that money, man! Look at that shit!
I gotta tell my mother and father...

28:52.649 --> 28:57.649
- Shut the fuck up!
- Cool out. All right, that's it! That's it!

28:59.072 --> 29:02.622
Bishop, I want you and Q
to settle this shit right now!

29:03.827 --> 29:05.327
Come on, y'all.

29:05.412 --> 29:08.212
You're like brothers.
Fuck that, you are brothers.

29:08.289 --> 29:10.829
No, fuck that.
We used to be like brothers.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.457
All right, we're gonna squash it.

29:14.838 --> 29:16.668
What do you say? Bishop?

29:19.843 --> 29:21.343
Yeah, it's cool.

29:42.532 --> 29:43.622
All right.

29:55.295 --> 29:57.795
I'm not making sense!
You're not making sense!

29:57.881 --> 29:59.381
You know why?

30:01.676 --> 30:03.006
What?

30:03.761 --> 30:06.431
Uh, how you doin'? Is Yolanda there?

30:06.514 --> 30:09.984
- Who the hell are you?
- Hi, Q. Let him in, Frank.

30:16.608 --> 30:19.938
Have a seat. I'm just cleaning out
some of Frank's things.

30:20.028 --> 30:22.568
Um, Frank, Q. Q, Frank.

30:31.331 --> 30:32.501
How you doin'?

30:43.134 --> 30:44.514
Q.

30:44.594 --> 30:49.434
What, did names like Mustafah
and Akbar become too hard to spell?

30:50.517 --> 30:52.187
My real name is Quincy,

30:52.268 --> 30:54.348
and I'm not too fond of that name,

30:54.437 --> 30:57.227
so people call me Q,
or Gee-Q, you know,

30:57.357 --> 30:58.897
like a nickname, abbreviation?

30:59.609 --> 31:01.609
Well, uh, Quincy,

31:01.694 --> 31:04.114
shouldn't you be out
stealing hubcaps or something like that?

31:04.405 --> 31:05.775
Asshole.

31:05.865 --> 31:08.825
Excuse me? Speak up.
I can't hear you, boy. What'd you say?

31:08.910 --> 31:12.710
Okay, Frank, I found it.
Remember these?

31:14.207 --> 31:16.667
What the hell are you laughing at,
you chain snatcher?

31:16.876 --> 31:20.126
Yolanda, look, who is this kid,
and what is he doing here?

31:20.505 --> 31:22.665
Oh, please, Frank,
don't you think it's a little late

31:22.757 --> 31:24.377
to try acting like a husband now?

31:24.467 --> 31:26.362
Look, I just think you're taking
this save-the-children shit

31:26.386 --> 31:27.613
a little bit too far. That's all.

31:27.637 --> 31:28.637
Bye.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.533
Look, I just wanted to tell you
what's up for your own good.

31:30.557 --> 31:33.307
- Bye, Frank.
- I can't express concern, what?

31:39.274 --> 31:40.534
So, that's him, huh?

31:42.402 --> 31:43.862
That's him.

31:43.945 --> 31:46.235
You know, he got a real
attitude problem.

31:46.322 --> 31:47.662
Definitely.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.168
Mmm, baby.

32:05.508 --> 32:08.338
- You're sweatin' already.
- I've been working out.

32:09.637 --> 32:11.467
You don't mind a little sweat, do you?

32:12.974 --> 32:14.934
<i>DJ Ralph McDaniels here.</i>

32:40.835 --> 32:42.625
- Want some?
- Mmm-mmm.

32:43.421 --> 32:44.921
What time is it?

32:47.967 --> 32:51.387
- A little past 10:00.
- I gotta get ready for work.

32:56.559 --> 32:59.689
Hmm. Why you playin' with my spot?

32:59.771 --> 33:02.521
You say you gotta get ready for work.

33:02.607 --> 33:05.567
- Is that your spot?
- Yeah. You know that's my spot.

33:06.194 --> 33:07.404
Mmm.

33:10.782 --> 33:13.622
Wish I could spend the night,
know what I'm saying?

33:13.701 --> 33:17.211
That would be nice. Sleep all day.

33:21.125 --> 33:24.995
I could make you breakfast in bed.

33:25.088 --> 33:27.128
That'd be dope.
That'd be the move. Word up.

33:30.051 --> 33:32.391
I think you'd better
let me deal with breakfast.

33:32.470 --> 33:34.010
- I can cook.
- Mmm-hmm.

33:35.515 --> 33:37.425
- You can cook, all right.
- Ha.

33:53.741 --> 33:55.871
- What's up?
- Yo, what's up, money?

33:55.952 --> 33:59.372
- What are you doin' here, man?
- We got a meeting at the ball court.

33:59.455 --> 34:01.245
- When is it?
- Tomorrow morning.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.538
I can't make it, man.

34:03.626 --> 34:05.626
What do you mean, you can't make it?

34:06.629 --> 34:08.129
I got a real important appointment.

34:08.214 --> 34:11.304
- Well, how important is it?
- It's my deejay audition.

34:11.426 --> 34:13.466
Oh, man.

34:15.638 --> 34:16.717
All right, Q.

34:16.806 --> 34:18.951
I'm going to straighten this out
with the rest of the boys,

34:18.975 --> 34:21.554
but make sure
you get there after you're done.

34:21.811 --> 34:25.521
This is serious business,
so we're gonna wait for you.

34:25.606 --> 34:26.726
That's cool.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.146
Why don't you tell me what it is now?
Get it over with?

34:29.235 --> 34:30.355
Later.

34:32.237 --> 34:35.318
By the way, good luck, man.

34:38.619 --> 34:39.789
Smooth.

36:52.086 --> 36:54.006
What do you mean it ain't good enough?

36:54.088 --> 36:55.758
What do you mean it ain't good enough?

36:55.840 --> 36:58.720
My name is Flex.
Look, this brother look like Gumby.

36:58.801 --> 37:00.404
What you talkin' about
I ain't good enough?

37:00.428 --> 37:03.598
I mean exactly what I said.
You need more experience, all right?

37:03.681 --> 37:05.731
You need to work on your mixing more.

37:05.808 --> 37:07.728
My... My... What you mean?

37:07.810 --> 37:09.520
What the fuck is wrong with my mix?

37:09.604 --> 37:11.164
Wait, I know
you didn't just snatch that from me.

37:11.188 --> 37:14.818
- What's wrong with my mix?
- Look, the shit is totally sloppy.

37:14.901 --> 37:16.941
Only a fool would open up
the way you do.

37:17.028 --> 37:19.358
Nobody likes the records
that you play, all right?

37:19.447 --> 37:23.077
It's just completely whack!
Face it! Face it.

37:23.159 --> 37:24.199
Fuck you!

37:24.285 --> 37:27.745
Well, you might have a chance
if that shit wasn't so small.

37:27.830 --> 37:29.000
Next!

37:49.977 --> 37:51.437
You ever deejay before?

37:51.520 --> 37:55.320
Yeah, you know, around the way,
make tapes for my boys, stuff like that.

37:55.399 --> 37:58.239
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, you local.

38:12.833 --> 38:14.353
- I really liked your tape.
- Thank you.

38:14.377 --> 38:16.297
- I'll see you Saturday night.
- That's cool.

38:16.379 --> 38:18.148
By the way, what is your name?
What do you go by?

38:18.172 --> 38:19.632
Gee-Q.

38:19.715 --> 38:21.335
Gee-Q. Come on.

38:26.555 --> 38:27.675
Yes!

38:31.185 --> 38:33.015
You know,
I think you and me can be closer

38:33.104 --> 38:35.524
than two breaths together
coming out of one nostril.

38:35.606 --> 38:38.276
- What's happenin', Trip?
- Yo, yo, my brother.

38:38.359 --> 38:41.609
Heard you made that deejay comp.
Congratulations. Mmm-hmm.

38:41.696 --> 38:43.906
Gee-Q, you know what I'm saying?
All right.

38:52.331 --> 38:53.671
What's up, man?

38:53.749 --> 38:56.669
I made that deejay contest Saturday
night, you know what I'm saying?

38:56.752 --> 38:59.052
- Once again, it's on.
- What you talkin' about?

38:59.130 --> 39:00.260
It's on.

39:00.464 --> 39:02.474
Man, what this nigga talking about now?

39:02.800 --> 39:04.680
Stickin' up
old man Quiles Saturday night.

39:04.927 --> 39:06.007
What?

39:06.095 --> 39:08.115
Man, you better stop bullshitting me,
you know what I'm saying?

39:08.139 --> 39:10.429
I ain't bullshitting you.
What, is you scared?

39:10.516 --> 39:12.494
- Steel ain't scared, are you, Steel?
- Here come Raheem.

39:12.518 --> 39:15.148
- Yo, what's up, Q?
- What's up, man?

39:15.229 --> 39:17.309
- Chillin'.
- You got it?

39:17.398 --> 39:21.238
- Yeah, I got it. Come on. Let's walk.
- What's goin' on with this?

39:21.444 --> 39:24.864
- Check this out.
- Oh, shit.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.833
Hmm.

39:29.910 --> 39:33.040
- This shit is sweet.
- I got it from Sweets.

39:33.122 --> 39:34.599
Yo, man,
I ain't never shot nobody before.

39:34.623 --> 39:37.593
Yo, be careful with that, man.
It's loaded.

39:37.668 --> 39:41.838
Look, old man Quiles is not gonna draw
on somebody that got a gun on him.

39:41.922 --> 39:44.052
Don't worry about it
It's gonna be a piece of cake, Q.

39:44.133 --> 39:45.973
Yeah, man, it'll be a piece of cake.

39:46.052 --> 39:49.682
We go in right before 11:00,
get the loot, and jet.

39:49.764 --> 39:52.854
The whole thing won't take
no longer than three fucking minutes.

39:52.933 --> 39:55.693
When did you all decide this?
This morning when I wasn't there?

39:55.770 --> 39:58.690
Yeah. While you was
at your, uh, appointment.

39:58.898 --> 40:00.318
Check this here, man.

40:00.483 --> 40:02.294
I gotta deejay Saturday night,
you know what I'm saying?

40:02.318 --> 40:03.878
I'm not tryin' to miss that for nobody.

40:03.903 --> 40:05.653
Guess you gotta
disappoint them then, huh?

40:05.738 --> 40:07.358
I ain't disappointing shit.

40:07.531 --> 40:08.991
Maybe not.

40:09.325 --> 40:11.219
There's going to be
a lot of deejays there, right?

40:11.243 --> 40:13.413
- Yeah.
- So, how do they pick who goes when?

40:13.788 --> 40:18.498
There's 40 deejays, 20 sets...
All I know is I go seventh.

40:18.876 --> 40:21.246
See, 'cause we're going to
need an alibi.

40:21.337 --> 40:24.547
Since you're going seventh,
that'll give us an opportunity to go in,

40:24.632 --> 40:26.432
do what we gotta do, and jet.

40:26.509 --> 40:27.639
Get the fuck out of there.

40:27.718 --> 40:29.048
I think that'll work.

40:29.136 --> 40:32.136
- What about the cops, man?
- Bishop checked it out.

40:32.223 --> 40:34.933
There's two overlapping patrols
about three minutes apart.

40:35.017 --> 40:36.437
So, we just gotta be fast.

40:36.769 --> 40:38.809
Yo, I think we should
plan this another time.

40:39.188 --> 40:40.608
This nigga's scared!

40:40.689 --> 40:43.210
Ain't nobody scared. I just told
you I had to deejay Saturday night.

40:43.234 --> 40:44.364
Fuck that shit!

40:44.610 --> 40:46.700
We're goin' Saturday night, and that's it.

40:47.404 --> 40:50.034
- I'll hold on to the gun.
- Why should he hold on to the gun?

40:50.199 --> 40:52.159
'Cause I already got it, motherfucker!

40:52.326 --> 40:54.429
Just let him hold the gun.
It ain't worth starting no shit over.

40:54.453 --> 40:56.083
- Now nigga be acting stupid.
- Come on.

40:56.163 --> 40:57.163
Shut the hell up!

40:57.248 --> 40:59.628
- Suck my dick.
- What time you gotta be there?

40:59.708 --> 41:00.878
Before 9:00.

41:00.960 --> 41:04.800
All right then, we'll pick up your shit,
go over there, we'll set you up.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.470
And you'll be straight, man.

41:15.683 --> 41:17.813

47:36.063 --> 47:39.273
Hey! We're closed.
No more customers. That's it.

47:39.358 --> 47:41.419
Freeze, motherfucker!
Turn around! Turn around!

47:41.443 --> 47:43.379
- At the wall! Quick!
- Don't shoot. Please don't shoot.

47:43.403 --> 47:46.373
- Turn around, motherfucker!
- I don't see nothing. Look. I won't.

47:46.448 --> 47:48.408
Shut the fuck up!

47:48.492 --> 47:49.886
I don't give a fuck about you!

47:49.910 --> 47:51.230
Take everything you want.

47:51.286 --> 47:52.746
Shut the fuck up!

47:52.829 --> 47:54.349
Please just don't shoot me, that's all.

47:54.373 --> 47:56.423
You're not going to shoot me, are you?

47:56.500 --> 47:59.500
- Please don't shoot me, all right?
- Shut the fuck up!

47:59.586 --> 48:00.916
Just tell me you won't shoot me.

48:01.004 --> 48:02.440
I'm gonna blow your ass away
if you don't keep quiet.

48:02.464 --> 48:04.934
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hang on to the fucking wall!

48:06.677 --> 48:08.257
Shut the fuck up, old man!

48:08.345 --> 48:09.385
- Clear?
- Yeah.

48:09.513 --> 48:11.223
All right! Let's go!

48:11.473 --> 48:12.893
Let's go!

48:21.483 --> 48:23.323
- Five-o!
- Five-o!

48:31.326 --> 48:32.616
Come on!

49:01.356 --> 49:03.356
What the fuck!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

49:03.567 --> 49:05.295
What the fuck you have
to shoot him for, man?

49:05.319 --> 49:06.588
You didn't have to shoot him, man.

49:06.612 --> 49:08.992
- He made a move!
- He didn't make no fucking move, man!

49:09.072 --> 49:11.832
- He did!
- You're lyin'! I was lookin' right at you!

49:11.908 --> 49:13.788
Yo, man. He's dead, isn't he, man?

49:13.910 --> 49:17.120
- What we going to do?
- Shut up, Steel! He knew who we was!

49:17.205 --> 49:19.785
Fat boy said your name.
He knew who the fuck we was!

49:19.875 --> 49:21.495
Everybody just shut up!

49:25.672 --> 49:28.342
Yo, man, what the fuck, man?
What we gonna do now?

49:28.425 --> 49:30.361
Raheem, man,
we gots to get rid of the fucking gun!

49:30.385 --> 49:32.095
Yeah, you're right, man.

49:32.346 --> 49:34.806
- Yo, Bishop, man, give me the piece.
- No.

49:34.890 --> 49:37.430
No? What the hell you mean, no?
Give me the gun.

49:37.517 --> 49:41.097
I mean, I'm holdin' on to this
till I say so. I'm not playin'.

49:42.105 --> 49:43.565
Oh, really?

49:43.649 --> 49:44.979
Stop this shit, man!

49:45.067 --> 49:46.817
Q, stop it, man!

49:46.902 --> 49:48.652
Yo, stop!

49:50.322 --> 49:51.912
Oh, shit!

49:56.787 --> 49:59.747
Hey! What's going on down there?

50:54.970 --> 50:56.680
Shut up, Steel!

51:01.935 --> 51:04.095
Don't you want to see
how much money we got?

51:11.862 --> 51:13.242
Here we go.

51:21.204 --> 51:23.084
What the fuck are you lookin' at?

51:23.915 --> 51:25.205
You goin' crazy, B!

51:26.084 --> 51:27.645
Don't you ever fucking
call me crazy again.

51:27.669 --> 51:29.129
I'll blow your fucking brains out.

51:29.212 --> 51:31.512
- You understand?
- I got it.

51:35.927 --> 51:38.507
Steel, bring your ass here. Come on!

51:41.850 --> 51:45.770
Come on, man, don't go fucking
crackin' up on me now, nigga!

51:45.854 --> 51:47.484
We all in this shit together!

51:47.564 --> 51:49.404
Fight that shit, come on!

51:56.031 --> 51:59.951
Look, if I go down, you go down.

52:00.035 --> 52:02.785
Those motherfuckers
don't give a fuck who shot who.

52:06.750 --> 52:08.080
Come on.

52:10.045 --> 52:11.505
Raheem.

52:13.048 --> 52:14.508
Damn.

52:16.635 --> 52:19.175
I warned him. You saw that!

52:19.304 --> 52:20.684
I told him, man.

52:20.764 --> 52:23.144
He had no business
grabbing the gun like that.

52:23.225 --> 52:26.185
- But it was Raheem, man!
- I don't give a fuck who it was!

52:26.269 --> 52:28.899
Nobody's supposed to
do that shit! Nobody!

52:29.231 --> 52:32.401
And if anybody got a problem with it,
we can deal with it right now.

52:33.985 --> 52:35.105
You got a problem with it?

52:37.906 --> 52:39.316
I'm warning you, Q.

52:46.206 --> 52:48.246
We gotta get the fuck back to the club.

52:49.543 --> 52:50.753
Um...

52:51.169 --> 52:55.379
If anybody asks about Raheem,
we don't know.

52:55.465 --> 52:56.965
We ain't seen him.

52:57.050 --> 52:59.720
You can't fucking keep up
with a man at a party.

52:59.803 --> 53:01.143
So...

53:02.848 --> 53:04.098
Um...

53:13.984 --> 53:15.194
Come on.

53:19.906 --> 53:21.276
Come on!

53:23.702 --> 53:24.872
Let's go.

53:28.373 --> 53:30.463
Come on! Let's go!

53:32.210 --> 53:33.340
Let's go.

54:06.828 --> 54:07.868
Good luck.

54:10.999 --> 54:12.379
Fuck that, you are brothers.

54:14.419 --> 54:15.419
Piece of cake, Q.

54:19.090 --> 54:21.300
<i>Round 2!</i>

54:22.677 --> 54:25.007
Q! Q! Q!

54:31.645 --> 54:34.645
<i>Once again, we have DJ,</i>

54:34.731 --> 54:37.361
<i>that fly guy, Gee-Q!</i>

54:38.360 --> 54:41.700
<i>And from Detroit, DJ Plaz!</i>

55:03.551 --> 55:06.891
Hey! Hey!
Get down here, you! Get down here!

55:08.473 --> 55:10.393
Shut up! Keep your mouth shut!

55:16.231 --> 55:18.651
Yo, Raheem is dead.
Somebody shot him.

55:18.733 --> 55:20.743
Hey, just sit back and be cool.

55:20.819 --> 55:23.069
I'm Detective Markham.
This is Detective Kelly.

55:23.196 --> 55:24.736
We want to ask you boys
some questions.

55:25.031 --> 55:26.531
Will you come here, please?

55:26.616 --> 55:27.906
Let's go.

55:30.912 --> 55:33.962
Let's open it up right now!

55:34.040 --> 55:36.080
Break away! Move it!

55:38.920 --> 55:41.590
When was the last time
you saw Raheem Porter breathin'?

55:41.756 --> 55:43.506
- Tonight at the club.
- What time?

55:43.717 --> 55:46.007
About a hour or two before Q set up.

55:46.261 --> 55:49.811
Where did he go after you last saw him?

55:49.889 --> 55:50.889
I have no idea...

55:50.932 --> 55:52.284
<i>Why do you think he left the club?</i>

55:52.308 --> 55:54.768
I don't know.
I thought he was checkin' out.

55:54.853 --> 55:57.863
So, he was talking to a girl,
clockin' the hos.

55:57.939 --> 56:00.029
- Clockin' the hos?
- Clockin' the hos?

56:00.150 --> 56:02.294
I'll ask you again, did you
leave the club at any time tonight?

56:02.318 --> 56:05.318
- I went to the basement for a little while.
- What for?

56:06.448 --> 56:08.868
I ran into an old girlfriend.

56:11.119 --> 56:13.289
So, what were you doing
down in the basement?

56:14.456 --> 56:17.126
- Do you know Fernando Quiles?
- Yes.

56:17.292 --> 56:20.187
We know you got popped
for boostin' in Quiles' store last June!

56:20.211 --> 56:21.881
Yes or no?

56:21.963 --> 56:24.383
- Well, I...
- Yes or no?

56:24.466 --> 56:25.716
Yes.

56:25.800 --> 56:29.720
Look, we know that Mr. Quiles
was regularly harassed by local gangs.

56:29.804 --> 56:32.314
Do you boys have any rivalry
with the other gangs?

56:32.474 --> 56:34.894
Puerto Rican gang, <i>Rapido Muerte.</i>

56:34.976 --> 56:36.476
Yeah. We know who they are.

56:36.561 --> 56:39.111
Radames. They always fucking with us.

56:39.189 --> 56:41.649
- Radames?
- Tell us about Radames.

56:41.733 --> 56:45.243
Puerto Rican gang.
They think they rule the fucking world.

56:45.320 --> 56:47.860
Isn't it true that your gang
regularly harassed Mr. Quiles?

56:47.947 --> 56:49.817
No. 'Cause we're not a gang.

56:49.908 --> 56:53.288
- Yeah. We didn't kill him, though.
- We didn't say you killed him!

56:53.369 --> 56:56.999
We said that you regularly harassed
Mr. Quiles! That's what we said.

56:58.166 --> 56:59.746
How about Porter?

57:00.710 --> 57:02.090
Did they harass him, too?

57:02.170 --> 57:06.380
If anybody had a motive to do Raheem
in, it would have been Radames.

57:07.509 --> 57:09.009
Q got loud on you.

57:09.094 --> 57:10.684
They screamed on you.

57:10.762 --> 57:12.323
That's why.
We just want to get the full confession.

57:12.347 --> 57:15.097
We want to get the story from you,
this way we can protect you.

57:15.183 --> 57:16.303
So we know what's happening.

57:16.351 --> 57:19.271
Look, when it goes down,
I can talk to the DA.

57:19.354 --> 57:20.984
And everything's going to be cool.

57:21.064 --> 57:23.944
- I didn't do nothing.
- You won't get much time.

57:24.025 --> 57:27.315
They say that you was the cat
that blew Raheem away.

57:29.948 --> 57:33.538
Now, who the fuck killed Porter?
Who killed him? Talk to me!

57:33.618 --> 57:35.498
I don't know, man! I don't know.

57:36.412 --> 57:38.122
Why do you seem so nervous?

57:38.206 --> 57:39.576
What are you nervous about?

57:40.500 --> 57:43.040
'Cause we're three Niggas
in a police station.

57:43.128 --> 57:44.408
It doesn't matter what happened.

57:44.462 --> 57:47.092
If y'all want us to be guilty,
we'll be guilty.

57:47.173 --> 57:50.763
If you didn't do nothing,
then you got nothing to worry about.

58:21.499 --> 58:24.919
Quincy, please eat something.

58:25.003 --> 58:27.923
- I don't feel like eating right now, Ma.
- I know, but just try, okay?

58:28.006 --> 58:32.296
Just try for me. Come on. Okay.

58:50.486 --> 58:52.856
Yo, man. I'm scared.

58:53.907 --> 58:55.527
You scared?

59:21.893 --> 59:24.733
You don't have to be doing all this.
I wish you would go sit down.

59:24.812 --> 59:26.916
- I got this, Myra.
- I know, but I can take care of this.

59:26.940 --> 59:28.570
Be with the people. It's okay.

59:28.650 --> 59:31.240
- I'm okay.
- How you doing, Mrs. Porter?

59:31.319 --> 59:33.399
- I'm fine, Eric.
- Hey, Steel.

59:33.488 --> 59:35.908
Help me. Bring in the corn bread.

59:35.990 --> 59:38.160
- This one?
- Yes.

59:39.327 --> 59:41.157
- What's up, Myra?
- Q!

59:42.247 --> 59:44.457
I haven't seen you in a long time.

59:44.540 --> 59:46.420
Yeah. Sorry it had to be like this.

59:46.501 --> 59:47.881
How you doing?

59:48.378 --> 59:50.878
Under the circumstances, I'm all right.

59:51.422 --> 59:55.012
I feel like I gotta stay strong
for Ma, though.

59:55.093 --> 59:57.223
She's trying
to deal with this by keeping busy,

59:57.303 --> 59:59.513
and she just keeps
going and going nonstop.

59:59.597 --> 01:00:03.057
And I just don't think
she's even cried yet or...

01:00:05.728 --> 01:00:08.728
Hey, Roland. How you doing?

01:00:08.815 --> 01:00:11.225
I should be asking you that.

01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:13.277
We're staying strong.

01:00:13.361 --> 01:00:17.371
I'd feel better if I knew the police
had somebody, though, you know?

01:00:18.366 --> 01:00:22.286
They say there was no witnesses,

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:26.370
and they don't have any leads or...
I don't know.

01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:29.133
We been askin' around, too.

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:32.420
Nobody's seemed to have seen
or heard anything.

01:00:32.964 --> 01:00:35.404
Find those motherfuckers
and the police don't have to do shit.

01:00:37.135 --> 01:00:38.715
Eric, put them here.

01:00:39.846 --> 01:00:41.426
- Uh, Myra?
- Yes, Ma.

01:00:41.514 --> 01:00:44.604
I've got to take care of that.

01:00:44.684 --> 01:00:45.854
Excuse me.

01:00:46.853 --> 01:00:49.063
You remember me, Mrs. Porter?
Roland Bishop?

01:00:49.147 --> 01:00:51.517
Yes, Roland. Thanks for coming.

01:00:51.607 --> 01:00:53.477
You don't have to thank me for that.

01:00:53.568 --> 01:00:55.568
Raheem was one of my best friends.

01:00:56.446 --> 01:00:58.424
It's really nice to see
people come together like this

01:00:58.448 --> 01:01:00.488
when something bad happens,
you know?

01:01:00.575 --> 01:01:04.825
I mean, personally, for me, though,
Raheem was like my brother.

01:01:04.912 --> 01:01:07.172
I mean, he was more than a brother.

01:01:07.248 --> 01:01:10.248
I mean, we did everything together,
just kickin' it every day.

01:01:11.294 --> 01:01:13.424
If there's anything I can do,
just let me know.

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:45.204
Who is it?

01:01:46.204 --> 01:01:48.834
- Hey, Q.
- Come on in, man.

01:01:49.916 --> 01:01:52.376
I heard about Raheem.
I really liked Raheem.

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.300
He's always nice to me.
Did somebody shoot him?

01:01:54.337 --> 01:01:55.377
Yeah.

01:01:55.463 --> 01:01:58.383
- Do you know who shot him?
- Nah, man.

01:01:58.466 --> 01:02:00.466
Hmm. Heard you got arrested.

01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:02.391
What? Where'd you hear that?

01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:04.010
- From Ishmal.
- Who?

01:02:04.097 --> 01:02:07.387
Ishmal, from the second floor.
And Wendy, Clarence, and Rashid.

01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:09.438
No, man. I ain't get arrested.

01:02:09.519 --> 01:02:11.309
Hey, Q!

01:02:11.646 --> 01:02:12.686
Ow!

01:02:12.897 --> 01:02:14.107
Shut up!

01:02:15.108 --> 01:02:16.438
Yo, Q!

01:02:20.363 --> 01:02:21.823
Hey, Q!

01:02:24.242 --> 01:02:25.952
Where is he?

01:02:26.035 --> 01:02:27.905
Motherfucker, you hurt my arm.

01:02:27.995 --> 01:02:30.115
- What'd you call me?
- You heard me!

01:02:30.832 --> 01:02:33.113
See, I told you about that word, all right?

01:02:34.001 --> 01:02:36.421
You gotta learn
not to use that bad language, man.

01:02:38.297 --> 01:02:40.297
Come on, man, seriously, though.

01:02:40.383 --> 01:02:42.803
- Yo, B, man, do me a favor, all right?
- What?

01:02:42.885 --> 01:02:45.425
If Bishop calls or if he comes by,
tell him I ain't here.

01:02:45.513 --> 01:02:46.865
Why? Don't you like Bishop anymore?

01:02:46.889 --> 01:02:49.519
- Why you ask so many questions?
- 'Cause I like Bishop!

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.520
- Why?
- 'Cause he's cool.

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:53.272
He's cool, huh?

01:02:53.354 --> 01:02:56.694
Well, you just tell Mr. Cool man, if he
calls or if he comes by, that I ain't here.

01:02:56.774 --> 01:02:58.944
What's in it for me?

01:02:59.026 --> 01:03:01.646
Man, you get to keep your own teeth,
that's what's in it for you.

01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:04.867
That's no good. On account that
I'm losin' my teeth anyway.

01:03:06.409 --> 01:03:07.699
I can't believe this, man.

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:10.785
I'm getting blackmailed
by my own baby brother?

01:03:12.206 --> 01:03:14.916
- I tell you what. You like that radio?
- Yeah.

01:03:15.001 --> 01:03:16.791
- It's dope, right?
- Right.

01:03:16.878 --> 01:03:19.008
- Go ahead. You can have it. It's yours.
- Really?

01:03:19.088 --> 01:03:22.048
- You just do what I tell you.
- Fine by me.

01:03:23.009 --> 01:03:25.009
Go ahead. It's yours.

01:03:26.512 --> 01:03:27.762
What do you say, man?

01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:30.180
Thank you.

01:03:51.913 --> 01:03:54.253
Damn, man. Has it been that long?

01:03:55.708 --> 01:03:58.748
You want to try that again outside
after school, you punk?

01:04:36.582 --> 01:04:37.922
What's up?

01:04:40.545 --> 01:04:43.375
I ain't seen you in a couple days.
What's been happenin'?

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.970
Man, get off that shit.

01:04:48.844 --> 01:04:51.894
It's over! There ain't nothin'
nobody can do about it now.

01:04:52.723 --> 01:04:55.143
- What do you want from me, man?
- Nothin'!

01:04:56.519 --> 01:05:00.359
Just came to see if you was all right,
see how you been doin'.

01:05:00.982 --> 01:05:02.732
Well, I ain't...

01:05:02.817 --> 01:05:04.897
I ain't talked to nobody, all right?

01:05:04.986 --> 01:05:08.236
I know. We crew.

01:05:08.322 --> 01:05:10.452
Always will be.

01:05:10.533 --> 01:05:12.333
I just came to see what's up.

01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:14.580
Let me tell you somethin', B.

01:05:14.662 --> 01:05:17.922
I'm only playin' your fucking game
'cause there ain't shit else to do.

01:05:17.999 --> 01:05:20.419
But don't you ever
pull a gun on me again in your life!

01:05:20.501 --> 01:05:22.091
Well, I hope I won't have to.

01:05:22.169 --> 01:05:25.299
Yeah, we all go down if you do,
'cause we all crew.

01:05:25.381 --> 01:05:27.171
Just try me if you think I'm bullshittin'!

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:34.389
Excuse me.

01:05:34.473 --> 01:05:36.183
Look at this!

01:05:37.018 --> 01:05:42.398
The brother finally decides to
stand up like a man and throw down.

01:05:42.481 --> 01:05:45.031
Too bad Raheem had to die first, huh?

01:05:47.361 --> 01:05:50.871
It's over. Everything starts from now.

01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:52.988
We all go down unless we stay together.

01:05:53.075 --> 01:05:55.945
Ain't no one man above the crew.
You know that shit.

01:05:57.204 --> 01:05:58.714
You're crazy, man.

01:06:02.877 --> 01:06:04.297
You know what?

01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:08.668
When you said that last time,
I was kind of trippin', right?

01:06:08.758 --> 01:06:12.758
But now, you right.

01:06:14.513 --> 01:06:16.223
I am crazy.

01:06:16.307 --> 01:06:18.227
But you know what else?

01:06:20.436 --> 01:06:23.266
I don't give a fuck.

01:06:23.356 --> 01:06:26.936
I don't give a fuck about you,
I don't give a fuck about Steel,

01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:29.816
and I don't give a fuck
about Raheem, either.

01:06:29.904 --> 01:06:32.574
I don't give a fuck about myself.

01:06:32.657 --> 01:06:35.697
Look, I ain't shit.
I ain't never gonna be shit.

01:06:35.785 --> 01:06:39.825
And you less of a man than me, so soon
as I decide that you ain't gonna be shit...

01:06:40.373 --> 01:06:41.623
Pow.

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:44.173
So be it.

01:06:44.251 --> 01:06:46.091
You remember that, motherfucker,

01:06:46.212 --> 01:06:48.422
'cause I'm the one
y'all need to be worried about,

01:06:51.425 --> 01:06:52.675
partner.

01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:25.747
Hey, baby, can I get you...

01:07:25.793 --> 01:07:27.963
- Don't do that!
- Sorry.

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:30.715
Don't ever scare me like that.
You better watch that shit.

01:07:30.798 --> 01:07:32.048
I said I was sorry.

01:07:32.133 --> 01:07:33.694
Didn't your mom ever teach you
to make yourself known

01:07:33.718 --> 01:07:34.778
before you enter a fucking room?

01:07:34.802 --> 01:07:36.682
You watch your mouth
in my house, Quincy.

01:07:36.804 --> 01:07:38.144
Fuck you.

01:07:42.643 --> 01:07:44.603
I am not one of your
high school playmates,

01:07:44.687 --> 01:07:46.287
and if you cannot respect me
in my house,

01:07:46.355 --> 01:07:48.355
then get out of my house.

01:07:48.441 --> 01:07:50.111
Go on! Out!

01:07:57.408 --> 01:08:00.828
Come on, nigga. I got what you need.

01:08:03.831 --> 01:08:07.921
Well, well, lookee here.

01:08:08.002 --> 01:08:10.132
Get the fuck out of here!

01:08:14.175 --> 01:08:16.755
I want to talk to your sorry ass outside.

01:08:16.844 --> 01:08:20.894
Yo, man. I think Bishop's lost it, man.

01:08:20.973 --> 01:08:22.063
What else is new, man?

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.520
I mean seriously, man.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.100
He was talkin'
some way-out shit last night,

01:08:26.187 --> 01:08:28.687
about how he got more juice
than everybody else on the street,

01:08:28.773 --> 01:08:30.332
and everybody learn
not to fuck with him,

01:08:30.357 --> 01:08:32.187
or else they end up
like Raheem and Quiles.

01:08:32.318 --> 01:08:34.068
He say that shit in front of people?

01:08:34.153 --> 01:08:39.453
No, only to me, but he meant it, man.
I could see it in his face.

01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:41.993
Something's gonna happen, man.
I can feel it.

01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:45.327
- Yo!
- Get the fuck off me!

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:55.377
What's the idea
of tellin' the cops I killed Raheem?

01:08:56.216 --> 01:08:58.216
Look, I ain't tell the cops a damn thing.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:01.062
Don't give me that shit, man.

01:09:01.138 --> 01:09:06.848
They brought me in for questioning.
And they said you said I did it.

01:09:08.562 --> 01:09:11.322
I didn't tell 'em shit! You got it wrong.

01:09:11.398 --> 01:09:15.028
Nah, punk, you the one that got it wrong.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.490
You've been askin' for an ass-kickin'
for a long time.

01:09:17.613 --> 01:09:18.912
Come on, let's go help.

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:25.124
Raheem ain't here
to protect you no more.

01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:32.417
I don't need Raheem or nobody
for no fucking punk spic!

01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:38.180
He's fucking suicidal.

01:09:46.433 --> 01:09:51.483
Ever see <i>Chinatown?</i>

01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:54.686
Motherfucker.

01:09:54.775 --> 01:09:57.185
- I must have missed that!
- Oh shit! Shit.

01:09:57.278 --> 01:09:58.398
- Yo!
- Get him!

01:09:58.487 --> 01:09:59.777
Get in there!

01:10:05.411 --> 01:10:08.411
Yo, man, you think he saw us?

01:10:09.623 --> 01:10:11.543
Yeah.

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:13.285
What you think he gonna do?

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.680
I think we lost 'em.

01:10:27.266 --> 01:10:29.176
Riverside, motherfucker.

01:10:55.502 --> 01:10:57.382
I'm here to see Sweets.

01:11:23.906 --> 01:11:25.406
Uh, excuse me, Sweets?

01:11:27.242 --> 01:11:28.992
Do I know you?

01:11:29.078 --> 01:11:32.408
No. Um, I'm here to, uh...

01:11:33.374 --> 01:11:35.544
Come on, come on.
I don't have all night.

01:11:37.169 --> 01:11:38.839
I need some protection.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:45.340
How much we talkin' about?

01:11:45.427 --> 01:11:47.047
I got about 25.

01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:50.311
Damn, baby, you can't
get a slingshot for that.

01:11:57.856 --> 01:12:00.986
- Are you Lorraine Powell's son?
- Yes.

01:12:02.903 --> 01:12:05.493
Tell your mother Jackie said hi. Here.

01:12:14.164 --> 01:12:15.334
Come on!

01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:19.957
What'd you do to my machine?

01:12:21.088 --> 01:12:23.918
- Nothin'.
- You fucked up my machine!

01:12:24.925 --> 01:12:26.795
What the fuck's the matter with him?

01:12:44.945 --> 01:12:46.735
What do you want?

01:12:46.822 --> 01:12:49.202
I was thinkin'
you might like some company.

01:12:49.283 --> 01:12:50.703
Well, you thought wrong.

01:12:57.499 --> 01:12:58.629
Damn.

01:13:06.258 --> 01:13:07.468
You still here?

01:13:18.645 --> 01:13:20.725
- Hey!
- Yo, man! Damn!

01:13:20.814 --> 01:13:24.284
- 'Bout time you came home.
- What you doin' here, man?

01:13:24.359 --> 01:13:27.029
I thought we supposed to meet
at the pool hall. What happened, man?

01:13:27.112 --> 01:13:28.782
I thought...

01:13:28.864 --> 01:13:32.164
Just come on, I need you to help me
make this money back, okay?

01:13:32.242 --> 01:13:34.332
- Yeah.
- Just come on.

01:13:55.307 --> 01:13:56.847
Something wrong with the food?

01:14:00.521 --> 01:14:02.521
You thinkin' about Raheem?

01:14:06.652 --> 01:14:08.952
I know who killed him.

01:14:09.029 --> 01:14:10.609
What?

01:14:10.697 --> 01:14:13.407
- I know who killed Raheem.
- Who?

01:14:13.492 --> 01:14:15.292
I can't tell you that, Yolanda.

01:14:15.369 --> 01:14:18.789
- Did you tell the police?
- Hell no, I ain't tellin' no police.

01:14:20.707 --> 01:14:22.247
You're mixed up in it, aren't you?

01:14:22.334 --> 01:14:24.344
I didn't kill him,
if that's what you're thinkin'.

01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:25.919
Well, what are you gonna do about it?

01:14:30.342 --> 01:14:31.432
I don't know.

01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:35.555
You don't know? Excuse me?
I thought he was your best friend.

01:14:48.944 --> 01:14:50.284
Yes?

01:14:51.363 --> 01:14:53.913
Oh, hold on.

01:14:53.991 --> 01:14:55.371
It's Steel.

01:15:03.834 --> 01:15:04.964
What up?

01:15:05.043 --> 01:15:08.213
Q, man, I'm down here at the pool hall
with Bishop, man.

01:15:08.297 --> 01:15:11.337
What are you still doin'
down there, man? I told you about that.

01:15:11.425 --> 01:15:12.819
<i>He met me in my hallway, man.</i>

01:15:12.843 --> 01:15:14.893
What was I supposed to do, say no?

01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:17.180
Just come down here, man.
I'm scared as hell.

01:15:17.264 --> 01:15:18.434
Who is that?

01:15:19.433 --> 01:15:22.643
- No... No... No...
- Who the fuck is this?

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.870
- Yo, I'm out.
- Wait a minute, Q.

01:15:35.949 --> 01:15:38.869
- What's up?
- I'll speak to you later, Yolanda.

01:15:38.952 --> 01:15:40.042
Q, let me help you.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.931
I'll speak to you later, all right?
I gotta go.

01:15:41.955 --> 01:15:44.875
Okay, Q, listen. If you need me,
I'll be at the hospital later.

01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:46.538
Cool. Later.

01:15:51.089 --> 01:15:52.339
Shit.

01:15:53.842 --> 01:15:55.432
Yo, man, where we goin'?

01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:57.300
Just down here.

01:15:57.387 --> 01:16:00.767
Stop being a punk.
It ain't gonna take but a minute.

01:16:02.809 --> 01:16:04.809
You know, big chops,

01:16:06.021 --> 01:16:08.111
I really wanted all this to work.

01:16:09.066 --> 01:16:13.396
But you and Q, you ain't crew no more.

01:16:17.616 --> 01:16:20.826
See? That's what it's all about.

01:16:20.911 --> 01:16:22.411
See how scared you are?

01:16:22.496 --> 01:16:26.576
Don't you get tired of this shit?
What the fuck do you want from me?

01:16:26.792 --> 01:16:27.962
Nothin'.

01:16:34.174 --> 01:16:37.184
I'm not your common,
ordinary kind of guy.

01:16:39.137 --> 01:16:40.847
I got things that I could show you...

01:16:43.517 --> 01:16:45.387
Excuse us for a minute. Mmm.

01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:52.585
- What's happenin', young blood?
- What's up, Trip?

01:16:52.609 --> 01:16:55.029
Lookin' for that P-funk.

01:16:58.782 --> 01:17:01.082
- You seen Q around?
- Mmm-mmm.

01:17:01.159 --> 01:17:02.369
Somethin' I can do for you?

01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:06.710
Watch that nigga, man.

01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:08.830
He on some shit.

01:17:08.917 --> 01:17:10.787
I don't know what's wrong with him.

01:17:10.877 --> 01:17:12.957
He ain't been actin' like his-self lately.

01:17:13.046 --> 01:17:14.966
I mean, it kinda hurtin'

01:17:15.048 --> 01:17:17.798
because we been best friends
since we was in the second grade!

01:17:17.884 --> 01:17:18.934
Did you know that?

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:21.720
And I try to talk to him.

01:17:23.098 --> 01:17:26.598
He don't even hear me. He gone.

01:17:27.853 --> 01:17:30.403
I mean, I can look out for myself,

01:17:32.399 --> 01:17:35.109
but, man, I don't know
what he might do to Steel,

01:17:35.277 --> 01:17:37.527
the way he been actin' lately.

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:44.410
Q my man and everything,
but I'll do him in if I have to.

01:17:45.412 --> 01:17:46.462
Word up.

01:18:23.742 --> 01:18:26.095
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- Hello, Mrs. Thurman, this is Q.

01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:29.959
I mean, this is Quincy Powell.
Is Steel... Is Eric home?

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:31.768
<i>No. He was supposed to be home
a long time ago.</i>

01:18:31.792 --> 01:18:33.112
- Damn!
<i>- Do you know where he is?</i>

01:18:33.168 --> 01:18:34.798
Uh, thanks a lot, Mrs. Thurman.

01:19:08.078 --> 01:19:09.498
Shit!

01:19:51.037 --> 01:19:52.787
Hey, you! Come here!
I want to talk to you!

01:20:09.473 --> 01:20:10.813
Check down the hill.

01:20:45.509 --> 01:20:49.219
Thought you'd be lookin'
for transportation out of town by now.

01:20:49.846 --> 01:20:53.266
Trip, man,
you gotta tell me what's goin' on, man.

01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:57.690
You done slid down a razor blade
and landed in a alcohol river.

01:20:57.771 --> 01:21:01.321
Word is, you killed Raheem.

01:21:01.399 --> 01:21:03.649
And Quiles. And Radames.

01:21:03.902 --> 01:21:06.112
That's bullshit man!
You know me better than that!

01:21:06.404 --> 01:21:07.534
I don't know that.

01:21:07.614 --> 01:21:09.704
Come on, Trip.
You known me since I was a kid!

01:21:09.783 --> 01:21:12.293
I known a lot of killers
since they was kids.

01:21:12.869 --> 01:21:15.459
All right, I need you to
get word to Bishop for me.

01:21:15.622 --> 01:21:17.872
I'm listenin'.

01:21:17.958 --> 01:21:19.958
I want him to meet me tonight, alone.

01:21:20.168 --> 01:21:21.668
When? Where?

01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:23.759
Uh...

01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:27.680
125th Street, by the Henry Hudson,
by the diner?

01:21:28.677 --> 01:21:30.297
Tell him meet me there at 12:00.

01:21:33.306 --> 01:21:34.806
Yo, thanks a lot, man.

01:21:45.569 --> 01:21:47.239
That's all I got, G.

01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:04.746
<i>Damn. I've gotta stop this nigga, man.
It's me or him.</i>

01:22:18.226 --> 01:22:20.556
Don't shoot me! Please! Please!

01:22:22.272 --> 01:22:26.032
Don't shoot me!
Please! Please! Don't shoot me!

01:22:30.614 --> 01:22:32.954
<i>Damn, man!
What the fuck is happenin' to me?</i>

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.270
Excuse me just a minute.

01:23:02.354 --> 01:23:04.614
Will you excuse me? No, excuse me.

01:23:12.447 --> 01:23:14.067
He's going to be fine.

01:23:16.493 --> 01:23:20.213
Steel, it's Yolanda. What happened?

01:23:20.997 --> 01:23:26.087
Bishop shot me. He shot everybody.
He's tryin' to frame Q.

01:24:10.964 --> 01:24:14.844
What's up, partner? Don't fucking move!

01:24:15.635 --> 01:24:16.675
Where's the gun?

01:24:16.761 --> 01:24:19.181
Heard you copped a piece
from Sweets today.

01:24:19.264 --> 01:24:20.974
I ain't come out here for that, G.

01:24:21.057 --> 01:24:25.557
- Don't give me that bullshit!
- Check this here, man. I'm not you.

01:24:26.396 --> 01:24:30.226
We been tight since the second grade,
that's true, but I'm not you.

01:24:30.316 --> 01:24:33.066
You want the gun? I threw it in the river.

01:24:34.779 --> 01:24:36.239
You stupid motherfucker.

01:24:36.322 --> 01:24:39.492
Come on, man,
all this shit ain't worth it, man!

01:24:39.576 --> 01:24:42.116
Yo! You might get me now,
but sooner or later,

01:24:42.203 --> 01:24:43.333
it's gonna come back to you!

01:24:44.247 --> 01:24:46.917
Nah, brother. You got it wrong.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.540
See, this is your gun, Q.

01:24:48.626 --> 01:24:50.416
You was coming to get me,

01:24:50.503 --> 01:24:55.883
just like you got Raheem,
Radames, Quiles, and Steel.

01:24:55.967 --> 01:24:58.297
I was just the only one
man enough to take it from you.

01:24:58.386 --> 01:24:59.926
Self-defense, nigga.

01:25:00.013 --> 01:25:02.353
Come on, Bishop, man.
Let's cut out all this bullshit!

01:25:02.432 --> 01:25:05.192
We could end it right here!
It's me and you, Q and Bishop!

01:25:05.268 --> 01:25:07.188
You ain't gotta put on
no front for me, man!

01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:10.770
Nah, I ain't gots to do nothin'.

01:25:10.857 --> 01:25:14.187
You the past, bro. My time is now.

01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:17.360
You ready to die, nigga?

01:25:19.991 --> 01:25:21.081
Yeah.

01:26:58.047 --> 01:27:00.287
What the fuck are you gonna do?
Shoot me in the elevator?

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:06.390
Get down! Damn! Lisa, come here!

01:27:06.472 --> 01:27:08.392
You okay, brother? You okay?

01:28:30.056 --> 01:28:31.596
Bishop, come here!

01:29:29.615 --> 01:29:30.775

01:29:32.952 --> 01:29:35.122
Come on! Come on!

01:29:46.549 --> 01:29:51.349

01:29:51.971 --> 01:29:53.351
Now!

01:30:09.322 --> 01:30:10.662
It's over!

01:30:16.829 --> 01:30:18.459
Come on, Q. Don't let me go!

01:30:18.539 --> 01:30:20.709
I got you, Bishop, man!
Come on, hold on!

01:30:20.792 --> 01:30:23.172
- Q, don't let me go!
- Hold on, man!

01:30:23.252 --> 01:30:24.672
I can't hold on, man!

01:30:31.177 --> 01:30:32.677
Bishop!

01:31:02.041 --> 01:31:06.341
Yo. You got the juice now, man.

01:31:25.064 --> 01:31:28.404
- You big fathead jalopy.
- You gotta stop that lyin'!

01:31:28.484 --> 01:31:30.114
