02:02.840 --> 02:06.833
Thanks for inviting me over
to play strip study, Bud.

02:09.360 --> 02:14.718
Well, just like it says on the box,
'' lt's a game with no losers.''

02:17.280 --> 02:19.191
Okay, Ariel.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.914
'' Ulysses S. Grant was a general
in which war?''

02:25.000 --> 02:27.230
The war on drugs?

02:28.280 --> 02:30.157
-Oh, close.
-Oh, man.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.630
No, the correct answer
is the Civil War.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.397
They named a war
after '' Civil'' Shepherd?

02:37.880 --> 02:39.632
Oh, man.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.918
Now, you know the rules.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.993
For each wrong answer
you must remove one piece of clothing.

02:51.160 --> 02:56.109
Gee, if l'd known the rules,
l would have worn underwear.

03:02.040 --> 03:05.271
Okay. ''Who was the first president
of the United States?''

03:05.520 --> 03:07.954
-George Washington.
-Wrong.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.955
Gosh, Bud, l'm not that smart.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.760
l can't figure out
why you'd want to study with me.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.153
Well, you make every
subject come to life.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.033
Bud, finals are a week away...

03:30.280 --> 03:33.795
...and every time we try to study,
we end up having sex.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.995
Trust me, Ariel. ln two minutes,
we'll be right back to studying.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.909
Bud, wake up.

03:52.360 --> 03:53.315
What is it?

03:53.520 --> 03:57.991
George Washington was the first
president of the United States.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.993
Oh, my God.
Do you know what time it is?

04:05.240 --> 04:06.593
Six o'clock?

04:06.840 --> 04:10.355
-No, it's 8:00.
-Damn.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.829
No, we're not playing that game
anymore, Ariel. lt's morning.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.514
What am l gonna do?
lf l don't pass these exams...

04:20.720 --> 04:23.632
...l won't graduate.
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

04:23.880 --> 04:27.077
Won't it be awkward when your family
sees me coming out of your room?

04:27.320 --> 04:29.993
No, l have girls over here
all the time.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.639
They won't even bat an eye.
Come on. Let's go.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.229
That's my boy!

04:44.120 --> 04:48.671
Congratulations, son.
Your first sleep-over date.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.352
And with a girl too.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.513
Unless it's one of those
Crying Game kind of things.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.798
How did you guys
know Ariel was here?

05:01.040 --> 05:03.076
Well, for once the cries of:

05:03.320 --> 05:06.756
''Oh, Bud. Oh, Bud,''
wasn't just you throwing your voice.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.557
Yeah, and then about 1 a.m.
you suddenly yelled out the window:

05:12.800 --> 05:14.950
'' l just got busy.''

05:15.880 --> 05:18.872
Now, being down with the lingo
you youngsters use today...

05:19.080 --> 05:22.629
...l knew that you had just done
the function at the junction.

05:25.600 --> 05:29.149
So you spent the night
with my brother, Bud.

05:29.360 --> 05:33.035
Could you--? Could you bend
your head forward, please?

05:33.440 --> 05:35.635
Nope, no air nozzle.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.197
Will you leave her alone?

05:43.400 --> 05:46.358
The girl just had
the best sex of her life.

05:47.400 --> 05:51.916
l didn't say it was the best.
l said you did your best.

05:54.960 --> 06:00.080
So, Bud, shall l study your brains out
again tonight?

06:01.720 --> 06:05.156
No, no, no.
l really have to study alone.

06:05.360 --> 06:09.751
l have to get my diploma
so l can get the hell out of this house.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.072
Bud, come here a second, son.

06:13.280 --> 06:17.193
You're gonna do the right thing
by this girl now, aren't you?

06:18.200 --> 06:22.512
-You mean marry her?
-No, l mean never call her again.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.475
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks for the advice, Dad.

06:27.240 --> 06:31.358
Look, Ariel, l really need
to get my grades up, all right?

06:31.600 --> 06:34.717
So until finals are over,
l'm swearing off sex.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.278
That's a good idea.
l'm gonna get my grades up too.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.399
So you'll swear off sex also?

06:40.640 --> 06:43.950
No. l'm gonna sleep
with all my teachers.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.392
Thanks.

06:50.440 --> 06:53.716
E equals MC...

06:53.960 --> 06:55.359
...cup.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.189
l have to concentrate.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.912
And....

07:13.960 --> 07:16.269
She's still too sexy.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.393
Bud?

07:31.680 --> 07:33.636
What the hell is that?

07:33.880 --> 07:38.237
-Dad, l'm trying to study.
-What, why presidents marry ugly?

07:39.200 --> 07:41.998
But, son, actually,
l'm glad you're studying...

07:42.240 --> 07:44.231
...because you'll be quiet
while l watch TV.

07:44.440 --> 07:48.319
Today's the premiere of the new
Big 'Uns Network, B-U-N.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.555
Or BUN.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.955
Why do you have to watch it
down here on my small TV?

07:55.200 --> 07:58.237
We're not watching the BUN
on your small TV.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.557
You guys wanna give me a hand here
with Marcie's TV?

08:04.800 --> 08:07.678
-Sure.
-Put it right there.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.198
Dad, l'm not gonna be able to study...

08:10.400 --> 08:12.595
...with you guys sitting there
watching bimbo TV.

08:12.800 --> 08:16.839
They're not bimbos.
They're '' hooteracious'' Americans.

08:17.520 --> 08:20.876
And secondly, son, you're not even
gonna notice that we're here.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.679
Welcome to the premiere
of the Big 'Uns Network.

08:26.360 --> 08:29.750
I'm former Senator Bob Packwood...

08:30.480 --> 08:33.597
...and this is a real
dear-diary day for me.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.471
Yeah, shake them. Shake them.

08:40.840 --> 08:44.992
This is ridiculous. l'm gonna have
to find a place to study...

08:45.200 --> 08:47.760
...where there's absolutely
nothing that can turn me on.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.594
Why, Bud, what was that for?

08:55.480 --> 08:57.311
Just for being you, Miss Hardaway.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.596
You're so cute.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.838
What can l do for you?

09:03.040 --> 09:06.476
Be as creative as you like
with your answer.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.032
l would just like...

09:12.280 --> 09:15.033
...the reserved reading
for these classes, please.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.355
By the way, do you have
a poster of yourself...

09:18.560 --> 09:20.551
...l could hang up over my desk?

09:22.920 --> 09:25.832
Well, l don't have
a poster of myself...

09:26.040 --> 09:28.508
...but l was featured
in this magazine.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.549
''Library 'Uns''?

09:35.480 --> 09:37.550
l'm the centrefold.

09:45.640 --> 09:46.868
Here are the books.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.755
l've marked the parts you're supposed
to read and l've taken the liberty...

09:51.000 --> 09:53.594
...of putting my home phone number
on the bookmark.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.674
Oh, Bud, if you're looking
for a quiet place to study...

09:58.920 --> 10:03.277
...try that reading room there.
lt's very private.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.554
Thanks. l'll give it a try.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.274
Oh, this is perfect.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.152
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

10:17.360 --> 10:21.319
Now l can finally forget about sex...

10:21.520 --> 10:23.988
...and concentrate on my studies.

10:24.200 --> 10:28.637
Oh, l guess l'll start
with Shakespeare here.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.629
''Her breasts, lik e iv ory globes
circled with blue...

10:33.840 --> 10:36.877
...a pair of maiden worlds
unconquered. ''

10:37.840 --> 10:41.879
God, what I wouldn't give
for a pair of globes right now.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.354
Okay. l've gotta calm down.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.430
Okay, what could be less stimulating
than Biology?

11:07.560 --> 11:11.030
''The woman indicates
her readiness by--''

11:11.640 --> 11:15.315
''When the female has reached
peak arousal.... ''

11:16.240 --> 11:19.550
Oh, I'd lik e to peak at some arousal.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.471
Okay, no sex. No sex.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.995
No sex. No sex.

11:26.240 --> 11:29.471
Okay, Anthropology
will definitely cool me down.

11:29.720 --> 11:34.077
'' Costumes
of the Trobriand Islanders.'' Okay.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.551
The women use coconut shells
as clothing.

11:41.080 --> 11:45.358
Hey, those aren't coconut shells.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.960
But those are coconuts.

11:51.920 --> 11:55.117
A man can only take so much.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.797
l wonder what's up with Bud.

12:19.880 --> 12:24.795
This is Senator Packwood
live from the Big 'Uns Olympics.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.270
The officials are on the field
measuring.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.317
It's a new world record.

12:30.560 --> 12:34.394
Seventy-two and one half inches.
She's won the gold.

12:34.640 --> 12:38.599
Yes. Yes, l knew
she had what it takes.

12:39.720 --> 12:40.994
What event is it, long jump?

12:41.240 --> 12:43.800
No, they're just measuring her chest.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.473
Dad, l need to talk to you.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.036
The university
just put me on probation.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.475
Way to go, son.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.674
What did you do,
paint the school mascot?

12:56.920 --> 12:58.876
Go on a panty raid?

12:59.960 --> 13:04.078
l was caught
having sex in the school library.

13:05.760 --> 13:09.230
All right-o. That's my boy.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.990
Who's the lucky girl?

13:21.240 --> 13:23.071
You're shaking her.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.679
Dad, l'm gonna be tried
by the university deans.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.879
l might not be able to graduate.
Would you give me a hand?

13:37.560 --> 13:40.836
Obviously, you have too many
as it is.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.590
Dad, if l don't graduate,
l might just live here forever.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.278
Son...

13:48.760 --> 13:52.753
...you need the best defence
no money can buy.

14:01.080 --> 14:04.675
We will now try the case
of Trumaine College v. Bud Bundy.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.150
We have convened here
at the scene of the crime.

14:07.800 --> 14:12.874
You're not going to re-create it,
are you?

14:13.880 --> 14:16.713
No, that was not my intention,
Dean Markwand.

14:16.920 --> 14:20.276
But l cannot speak for Mr. Bundy.

14:20.640 --> 14:24.394
Perhaps he should be handcuffed
during these proceedings?

14:25.640 --> 14:27.915
That will not be necessary.

14:28.120 --> 14:31.874
l am confident that my client
can control himself.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.714
Then obviously you haven't seen
the videotape.

14:35.920 --> 14:40.710
l think l can defend Mr. Bundy
without viewing the tape.

14:40.960 --> 14:46.114
ln fact, that was the one condition
on which l agreed to take the case.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.232
Bud Bundy, how do you plead?

14:50.560 --> 14:53.870
Absolutely 1 00 percent not guilty.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.272
Yeah, it was really nice of Bud...

14:58.480 --> 15:02.109
...to let us watch the Big 'Uns
Extreme Games in his room.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.877
By the way, where is your son?

15:05.120 --> 15:07.315
l have no son.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.508
Haven't you heard?

15:09.760 --> 15:12.035
Bud was caught
in the Trumaine library...

15:12.280 --> 15:15.511
...doing what will soon be
referred to as...

15:16.000 --> 15:17.831
...''The Bundy.''

15:19.560 --> 15:21.949
Try to raise a kid
with values and decency--

15:22.200 --> 15:24.634
Oh, look, Big 'Uns freefall.

15:25.640 --> 15:29.474
You don't need a parachute
when you've got 'Uns.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.515
lt's enough to make you
wanna do ''The Bundy.''

15:35.520 --> 15:39.149
Oh, l give Bud credit.
The library's a pretty creative place.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.868
Most creative place l ever did it
was on an airplane.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.758
You did it in a bathroom on a plane?

15:44.640 --> 15:46.232
Who said anything
about a bathroom?

15:48.400 --> 15:51.597
And so in light
of the videotape evidence...

15:51.840 --> 15:55.549
...and the eyewitness account
of the now-traumatized student...

15:55.800 --> 15:59.873
...who had the misfortune of opening
the door at exactly the wrong moment...

16:01.160 --> 16:06.837
...we must conclude that Bud Bundy
is absolutely 1 00 percent guilty.

16:08.640 --> 16:11.791
Does the defence possibly have
anything to say...

16:12.000 --> 16:15.959
...other than the obvious
'' l'm so, so sorry''?

16:16.880 --> 16:20.077
We do not dispute the evidence
of this case.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.675
Then you admit
the defendant committed this crime.

16:22.920 --> 16:27.675
He committed the act.
There was no crime.

16:27.920 --> 16:32.277
Allow me to quote
from your official student handbook.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.799
''Abstinence saves lives.''

16:37.960 --> 16:43.353
And what guarantees abstinence
better than self-love?

16:45.680 --> 16:49.309
Constant, never-ending self-love.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.239
l ask you to look
at this young man.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.631
Would you rather
he do what he did...

16:56.880 --> 16:58.632
...or be out there breeding?

17:01.640 --> 17:04.632
And l did the Bundy
at the lce Capades.

17:06.119 --> 17:09.669
During my driving test.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.515
Watching Shaft.

17:14.839 --> 17:17.194
On my honeymoon.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.029
-On your honeymoon?
-That doesn't count.

17:24.280 --> 17:27.078
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

17:27.319 --> 17:31.108
l think l may have been
a little it too harsh on my son.

17:31.880 --> 17:36.192
The only thing he really did wrong was
going to the library in the first place.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.154
The rest is totally understandable.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.312
l mean, we men have our needs.

17:46.120 --> 17:50.272
lt's women who tell us
these things are wrong.

17:52.120 --> 17:55.157
And why? Because they wanna take
away the only good sex we have.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.360
l know now what we must do.

18:00.840 --> 18:06.995
And so in conclusion,
l say if touching yourself is a crime...

18:07.400 --> 18:10.949
...then who among us
does not deserve the chair?

18:17.400 --> 18:18.958
All right.

18:19.200 --> 18:25.275
We concede that what Bud did
was not in itself a crime.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.876
But how do you explain
doing it in the library?

18:29.120 --> 18:30.792
Well, l'm glad you asked that.

18:31.040 --> 18:35.318
Bud, how the hell do you explain it?

18:37.280 --> 18:38.918
Easily.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.151
l was set up.

18:42.080 --> 18:45.834
l direct the attention of the court
to Miss Hardaway...

18:47.120 --> 18:50.157
...who has had a crush on me
for years.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.953
ln fact, at this very moment...

18:53.200 --> 18:56.351
...she's thinking about
what l must look like under my clothes.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.838
That is a tight little lie.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.709
l-- l mean a little white lie.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.516
Can you deny
that on the night in question...

19:08.720 --> 19:10.790
...you gave me
your home phone number?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.673
This number?

19:17.040 --> 19:19.235
Did you not tell me
which study room to sit in...

19:19.480 --> 19:22.438
...knowing full well it had
a surveillance camera?

19:25.440 --> 19:28.830
And did you not give me
erotic textbooks...

19:29.040 --> 19:31.110
...with all the good parts marked?

19:32.360 --> 19:35.670
You gave him Costumes
of the Trobriand Islanders?

19:38.200 --> 19:41.192
-l did.
-My God.

19:41.440 --> 19:44.193
The boy is only human.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.072
So you see l was entrapped...

19:53.520 --> 19:58.992
...by a middle-aged librarian who saw
a hot little tushie and wanted more.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.678
That is not true.

20:01.920 --> 20:07.358
l dare you to take a look at this
and still deny your feelings.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.238
All right, l confess.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.192
l am in love with Bud Bundy.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.957
Whenever he comes in the library...

20:18.200 --> 20:22.557
...l turn the heat up so he'll have to
strip down to his tank top.

20:23.920 --> 20:28.391
When he returns a book late,
l always hope he'll say:

20:28.640 --> 20:31.871
'' l've been a bad boy, Miss Hardaway.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.994
Spank me hard.''

20:40.040 --> 20:43.510
The court will excuse me if l heave?

20:45.320 --> 20:48.790
l've read every book
on loving in this library.

20:49.040 --> 20:53.079
l could do things to him
he's never even dreamed of.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.313
Really?

21:02.720 --> 21:05.280
l think we have a unanimous verdict.

21:05.520 --> 21:09.991
We will dismiss this case,
allow Mr. Bundy to graduate...

21:10.240 --> 21:12.754
...and seal the records...

21:13.000 --> 21:18.313
...so as to maintain the good name
of the Michael Milken Library.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.758
Oh, thank you, Mrs. D'Arcy.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.228
Oh, you were great.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.916
And best of all, nobody's ever gonna
know about this ugly little incident.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.593
Free the Bundy one!

21:34.840 --> 21:38.230
Free the Bundy one
Free the Bundy one

21:38.480 --> 21:41.790
Free the Bundy one
Free the Bundy one

21:42.040 --> 21:45.237
This is Miranda Veracruz
de la Jolla Cardenal...

21:47.520 --> 21:49.795
...broadcasting live
at Trumaine College...

21:50.000 --> 21:52.309
...where the group called NO MA'AM
is picketing...

21:52.520 --> 21:56.433
...in support of Bud Bundy's
inalienable right as an American...

21:56.680 --> 21:59.672
...to touch himself in the library...

22:00.000 --> 22:02.833
...or anywhere else for that matter.

22:03.080 --> 22:06.755
Four, three, two, one
Bud's alone but he has fun

22:07.000 --> 22:09.992
Two, four, six, eight
It's his only steady date

22:10.240 --> 22:13.073
One, two, three, four
He shouldn't have to lock the door

22:14.320 --> 22:16.151
Free the Bundy one!
