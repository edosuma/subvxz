WEBVTT

01:49.401 --> 01:52.168
If I spoke about it...

01:52.170 --> 01:53.738
If I did...

01:54.570 --> 01:57.005
what would I tell you?

01:57.007 --> 01:58.375
I wonder.

02:00.443 --> 02:02.878
Would I tell you about the time?

02:02.880 --> 02:05.613
It happened a long time ago, it seems...

02:05.615 --> 02:08.818
in the last days of a fair prince's reign.

02:10.454 --> 02:12.823
Or would I tell you about the place?

02:13.724 --> 02:16.458
A small city near the coast...

02:16.460 --> 02:18.829
but far from everything else.

02:22.265 --> 02:24.134
Or, I don't know.

02:25.367 --> 02:27.638
Would I tell you about her?

02:28.805 --> 02:31.174
The princess without voice.

02:33.508 --> 02:35.643
Or perhaps I would just warn you

02:35.645 --> 02:37.614
about the truth of these facts...

02:39.215 --> 02:41.084
and the tale of love and loss...

02:42.618 --> 02:47.657
and the monster who tried to destroy it all.

03:41.209 --> 03:42.708
My Lord Hedak.

03:42.710 --> 03:46.446
So, you are troubled.
Tell me.

03:49.282 --> 03:50.982
I've...

03:50.984 --> 03:54.785
I have sinned.
I've offended the god.

03:54.787 --> 03:56.720
I am deep in sin, my Lord Hedak.

03:56.722 --> 03:58.290
Let me judge of that.

04:00.727 --> 04:03.896
I've doubted the ceremony of the sacrifice.

05:22.574 --> 05:24.473
I don't want to go up there.

05:24.475 --> 05:27.343
Why, everybody's got to go upstairs, Miss Lloyd,

05:27.345 --> 05:29.846
if they wants to go to bed.

05:29.848 --> 05:33.083
The sirens wake you up?
There was a fire.

05:33.085 --> 05:34.987
The chocolate factory.

05:37.288 --> 05:38.654
Do you smell that?

05:38.656 --> 05:40.490
Oh, my!

05:40.492 --> 05:41.859
Toasted cocoa.

05:42.693 --> 05:45.630
Tragedy and delight, hand in hand.

05:45.456 --> 05:46.786
Something to eat?

05:46.763 --> 05:49.431
Oh, my dear child.

05:49.433 --> 05:52.600
I would waste away if you
weren't here looking after me.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.703
I am the proverbial starving...

05:54.705 --> 05:57.039
Watch this.

05:57.041 --> 05:59.677
It's Bojangles, the stair dance.

06:00.611 --> 06:03.778
Oh, that's so hard.
Cagney did it.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.248
Different, but beautiful.

06:05.226 --> 06:06.856
It's beautiful.

06:06.816 --> 06:08.917
- I wanna do that, too.
- All right!

06:08.919 --> 06:10.385
- Are you ready?
- Yup.

06:10.387 --> 06:11.585
Come on.

06:11.587 --> 06:14.092
Ah!

06:15.592 --> 06:17.361
Say, you catch on quick.

06:18.694 --> 06:20.663
Look out now.
Here's your last one!

06:55.964 --> 06:56.831
Elisa!

06:57.765 --> 06:59.732
Next time you come to bring the rent...

06:59.734 --> 07:02.869
I want you to stay and see the Bible movie, huh!

07:02.871 --> 07:04.470
I have...

07:04.472 --> 07:07.206
You bring your neighbor Giles.
He's a good boy.

07:07.208 --> 07:08.677
Bible movie and comedy!

07:09.511 --> 07:10.609
Nobody's coming to the theater, huh?

07:10.611 --> 07:14.047
I'll throw in a free popcorn and soda!

07:14.049 --> 07:15.014
Oh, no!

07:15.016 --> 07:17.016
For God's sake, there are two "S's" there!

07:17.018 --> 07:21.086
Come on! Two "S."
"Mardi Grass!" "Mardi Grass!"

07:21.088 --> 07:22.155
Two "S."

08:26.718 --> 08:28.819
All new personnel, be advised that sector 12

08:28.821 --> 08:30.689
has now been cleared to level A safety.

08:30.691 --> 08:34.457
Elisa! Come on.
I'm here already.

08:34.458 --> 08:35.725
You gotta learn to be on time.

08:35.727 --> 08:38.395
Hey! What are you doing?
Don't cut in, dummy!

08:38.397 --> 08:40.532
Leave her alone, woman.
I was keeping her place.

08:40.534 --> 08:43.534
I get reported, I come after you and the mute.

08:43.535 --> 08:46.372
You do that, Yolanda.
You do that.

08:59.818 --> 09:02.752
My feet are already killing me.

09:02.754 --> 09:04.820
I made Brewster pigs in a blanket

09:04.822 --> 09:06.623
tonight before leaving...

09:06.625 --> 09:09.625
and boy, he just ate 'em up.

09:09.627 --> 09:12.162
No "thank-yous", no "yum-yums".

09:12.164 --> 09:13.997
Not a peep.

09:13.999 --> 09:16.599
Man is as silent as a grave.

09:16.601 --> 09:19.035
But if farts were flattery...

09:19.037 --> 09:21.872
honey, he'd be Shakespeare.

09:21.874 --> 09:24.240
Then I get home and I make him breakfast.

09:24.242 --> 09:26.777
Eggs, bacon, and buttered toast.

09:26.779 --> 09:28.810
I butter the man's toast, Elisa.

09:28.812 --> 09:30.478
Mmm-hmm, both sides....

09:30.480 --> 09:31.881
as if he was a child.

09:31.883 --> 09:34.150
And I don't even get a thank-you.

09:34.152 --> 09:36.252
You'd be grateful

09:36.254 --> 09:38.119
because you're an educated woman.

09:38.121 --> 09:39.988
But my Brewster, all he had going for him

09:39.990 --> 09:42.190
was animal magnetism back in the day.

09:42.192 --> 09:44.560
Hasn't worked in a while.

09:44.562 --> 09:47.295
What in the Sam Hill? No!

09:47.297 --> 09:49.731
You boys mind putting the trash in the can?

09:49.733 --> 09:51.269
That's what it's there for.

09:52.470 --> 09:54.837
Hard to believe, huh?
That's what it's there for.

09:54.839 --> 09:56.472
All right, all right.
Sorry, Zelda! Sorry!

09:56.474 --> 09:58.107
I don't know what they're doing.

09:58.109 --> 10:00.008
Making a goddamn mess is what I think.

10:00.010 --> 10:02.512
Zelda!
Stop that chatter, please.

10:02.514 --> 10:03.679
Yes, sir.

10:03.681 --> 10:05.948
There's no call for the blasphemy.

10:05.950 --> 10:07.885
Sorry, Mr. Fleming, sir.

10:10.019 --> 10:12.252
A moment of your time!

10:12.254 --> 10:14.522
Today, we are receiving a new team

10:14.524 --> 10:16.723
and asset here in T-4.

10:16.725 --> 10:18.059
This is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler

10:18.061 --> 10:20.161
from our sister facility in Galveston.

10:20.163 --> 10:24.366
Now, I don't wanna bolster
or overstate the matter

10:24.368 --> 10:28.136
but this may very well be
the most sensitive asset

10:28.138 --> 10:30.972
ever to be housed in this facility.

10:48.590 --> 10:52.024
- How was your trip?
- Fine. Who's security here?

10:52.026 --> 10:54.030
Just one moment, please.

10:55.296 --> 10:58.532
Security! Who's security?

10:58.534 --> 11:00.201
Welcome to T-4, sir.

11:00.203 --> 11:02.302
Yes, sir, I am Fleming, head of Security.

11:02.304 --> 11:04.670
And if there are questions
you have or concerns...

11:04.672 --> 11:05.972
you just come talk to me.

11:16.319 --> 11:19.421
Do you understand?
I'll be in charge from now on.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.270
Get them out.

11:37.237 --> 11:39.672
Help me move this cylinder into the compressor.

11:43.611 --> 11:45.213
Bring it here.
Bring it here.

11:48.915 --> 11:51.350
Bring it over here.
There. Mount the cylinder.

11:51.352 --> 11:52.951
We need to pressurize it immediately.

11:52.953 --> 11:55.424
- From there to there.
- Elisa! Elisa!

11:56.290 --> 11:57.724
Come on!

11:57.726 --> 11:59.892
Lord, what goes on in this place?

11:59.894 --> 12:00.959
Did you see that?

12:20.947 --> 12:22.446
Yes, I'm wearing the hairpiece.

12:22.448 --> 12:23.381
How does it look?

12:23.383 --> 12:26.019
Oh! Be careful of the car.

12:27.221 --> 12:28.887
And it's not a hairpiece.

12:28.889 --> 12:31.024
It's a toupee. It's French.

12:32.726 --> 12:33.758
It's eternal, see?

12:33.760 --> 12:37.195
Tantalus never achieved the escape of death....

12:37.197 --> 12:38.896
because the fruit on the branches

12:38.898 --> 12:41.098
was just always out of his reach...

12:41.100 --> 12:42.800
and the water in the stream receded

12:42.802 --> 12:44.602
every time he stooped down to drink.

12:44.604 --> 12:47.338
And so that's why we say things today like..

12:49.842 --> 12:51.909
"Look at those tantalizing pies."

12:51.911 --> 12:55.047
Thank you!
Y'all come back now, you hear?

12:55.781 --> 12:57.580
Yes, pies for breakfast.

12:57.582 --> 12:59.151
Just trust me on this.

13:00.153 --> 13:03.253
Hey, folks!
Welcome to Dixie Doug's.

13:03.255 --> 13:04.854
I've seen you in here before, right?

13:04.856 --> 13:06.156
Yes.

13:06.158 --> 13:07.724
I've been here a couple
of times, as a matter of fact.

13:07.726 --> 13:09.059
Partial to key lime pie?

13:09.061 --> 13:12.896
I am, I am.
Two to go.

13:12.898 --> 13:15.064
Just go with it, please. Please.

13:15.066 --> 13:18.535
Uh, I, uh, it's a craving that I indulge in.

13:18.537 --> 13:21.471
Can't possibly be good for me,
but nothing I like is.

13:21.473 --> 13:24.173
No, no, it's a mighty fine pie, key lime.

13:24.175 --> 13:25.308
You wouldn't happen to be

13:25.310 --> 13:26.909
the famous "Dixie Doug" himself, would you?

13:26.911 --> 13:28.078
Oh, heck no.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.511
The pies are trucked throughout the country.

13:29.513 --> 13:32.115
- They call it "franchising," see?
- Oh.

13:32.117 --> 13:34.049
They give us the spinners, the signage.

13:34.051 --> 13:35.986
That there's "Pie Boy," our mascot.

13:35.988 --> 13:37.118
I don't talk like that.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.456
I'm from Ottawa.

13:39.458 --> 13:40.459
No.

13:41.258 --> 13:43.394
I completely bought it.

13:45.330 --> 13:46.764
"That's-a-great-a-pie."

13:49.200 --> 13:51.333
The... The, uh...

13:51.335 --> 13:54.204
The little... little guy,
is he supposed to be Italian?

13:54.905 --> 13:56.337
I guess so.

13:56.339 --> 13:58.175
Well, it's very clever.

14:01.179 --> 14:03.514
Y'all come back now, you hear?

14:05.815 --> 14:07.517
"Y'all come back now."

14:09.319 --> 14:12.154
Do you think he meant it?

14:12.156 --> 14:14.791
He had noticed me.
I mean, you... you heard that.

14:17.627 --> 14:20.629
This pie is rather sordid.

14:20.631 --> 14:22.197
But don't spit it out.

14:22.199 --> 14:23.332
Next time we go,

14:23.334 --> 14:25.167
we'll just try a different flavor. Hmm?

14:27.938 --> 14:30.538
Save it for later, put it away.

14:30.540 --> 14:33.340
6:00 AM eastern standard time.

14:33.342 --> 14:34.743
The skies are beginning to lighten...

14:36.411 --> 14:38.613
as a cool North wind rustles across...

14:38.615 --> 14:40.081
...groups of Negroes have been swarming

14:40.083 --> 14:42.048
in front of and behind the advancing police.

14:42.050 --> 14:43.985
Oh, dear God!
Change that awfulness.

14:43.987 --> 14:45.856
I do not wanna see that.

14:47.189 --> 14:48.592
I do not wanna see it.

14:50.326 --> 14:51.557
Pretty baby

14:51.559 --> 14:54.061
Oh, that's better, that's better.

14:54.063 --> 14:56.029
Oh, look at Betty.

14:56.031 --> 14:58.032
Oh, God, to be young and beautiful.

14:58.034 --> 15:01.469
If I could go back to when I was 18...

15:01.471 --> 15:02.903
I didn't know anything about anything,

15:02.905 --> 15:04.507
I'd give myself a bit of advice.

15:04.417 --> 15:06.247
What would you say?

15:06.241 --> 15:08.743
I would say, "Take better
care of your teeth...

15:08.745 --> 15:10.609
and fuck a lot more."

15:10.611 --> 15:12.512
Oh no, no, that's very good advice.

15:12.514 --> 15:15.282
Pretty baby of mine

15:20.322 --> 15:22.725
Pretty baby of mine

16:05.331 --> 16:07.235
Will you look at this?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.401
Look.

16:09.403 --> 16:10.902
Some of the best minds in the country

16:10.904 --> 16:13.939
peeing all over the floor
in this here facility.

16:13.941 --> 16:15.375
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

16:16.377 --> 16:19.243
There's pee freckles on the ceiling now.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.948
How'd they get it up there?

16:22.316 --> 16:25.485
Just how big a target do they need, you figure?

16:27.253 --> 16:29.623
They get enough practice, that's for sure.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.124
My Brewster...

16:33.126 --> 16:35.326
no one's ever called him a great mind,

16:35.328 --> 16:39.731
but even he manages to hit the can

16:39.733 --> 16:40.968
70% of the time.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.404
Excuse us, sir.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.506
No, no, no, that's all right.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.676
Go ahead.

16:51.543 --> 16:54.978
You ladies seem to be chatting enjoyably.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.682
Girl talk, no doubt.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.286
Don't mind me.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.792
Elisa.

17:11.561 --> 17:13.029
Look, don't touch.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.396
That lovely dingus right there

17:14.397 --> 17:15.932
is an Alabama Howdy-do.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.433
Molded grip handle...

17:17.435 --> 17:20.336
low current, high-voltage,
electric shock cattle prod.

17:20.338 --> 17:22.873
Name's Strickland, Security.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.973
Fleming's security.

17:32.783 --> 17:33.916
Oh, no.

17:33.918 --> 17:35.585
No, a man washes his hands

17:35.587 --> 17:38.654
before or after tending to his needs.

17:38.656 --> 17:40.925
It tells you a lot about a man.

17:41.992 --> 17:44.460
He does it both times...

17:44.462 --> 17:46.731
points to a weakness in character.

17:50.166 --> 17:51.368
Ladies.

17:54.204 --> 17:56.907
It was very pleasant chatting with you both.

18:18.395 --> 18:20.627
Short people are mean.

18:20.629 --> 18:22.064
I never met a short man

18:22.066 --> 18:23.998
that stayed nice all the way through.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.366
No, sir.

18:25.368 --> 18:27.737
Mean little backstabbers, all of them.

18:28.538 --> 18:30.604
Maybe it's the air down there,

18:30.606 --> 18:32.408
not enough oxygen or something.

19:00.403 --> 19:02.134
Help! He's losing blood!

19:02.136 --> 19:03.202
Help!

19:03.204 --> 19:04.505
Come on, come on.

19:09.745 --> 19:11.478
You think the Russians broke in?

19:11.480 --> 19:12.912
I don't think so.

19:12.914 --> 19:14.081
And if they did...

19:14.083 --> 19:16.683
Duane's meatloaf will kill them all, honey.

19:16.685 --> 19:19.318
It was two shots.
Did you hear them?

19:19.320 --> 19:21.654
All right, three.
And that scream.

19:21.656 --> 19:23.457
Lord, what ever happens in this place?

19:23.459 --> 19:25.528
You two, come with me.

19:26.261 --> 19:27.695
Right now, Mr. Fleming, sir?

19:27.697 --> 19:29.696
Any chance we get to conclude our dinner?

19:29.698 --> 19:31.534
Now!

19:34.201 --> 19:35.668
Oh, heavens to Betsy.

19:35.670 --> 19:37.102
We are in a pickle.

19:37.104 --> 19:39.139
We are in such a pickle.

19:48.350 --> 19:50.815
You will have exactly 20 minutes

19:50.817 --> 19:53.584
to render this... this lab
immaculate, and so on and so forth.

19:53.586 --> 19:55.623
20 minutes.

19:57.357 --> 19:59.794
It's a lot of blood.
What went on in here?

20:00.961 --> 20:02.564
I can handle pee.

20:03.498 --> 20:05.398
I can handle poo.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.499
But blood... Ugh.

20:07.501 --> 20:10.369
Blood just does something to me.

20:10.371 --> 20:12.838
Here, hon. Help me mop it up.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.042
The sooner we get outta here
the better.

20:28.955 --> 20:30.791
Is that a tater tot?

20:32.191 --> 20:33.460
Oh!

20:34.026 --> 20:35.629
It's a finger.

20:36.964 --> 20:38.463
There's two fingers.

20:38.465 --> 20:39.630
Okay, okay.

20:39.632 --> 20:41.533
Put them away.
And just wait here.

20:41.535 --> 20:43.603
I'm gonna go get Mr. Fleming.

21:16.669 --> 21:19.270
Where are these body parts?

21:19.272 --> 21:20.540
The body parts?

21:26.711 --> 21:28.578
No, I believe you, honey.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.782
But are you sure it was alive?

21:30.709 --> 21:31.579
I'm sure.

21:31.815 --> 21:34.050
Because I saw a mermaid once
in a carnival tent...

21:34.052 --> 21:37.285
and it was a monkey sewn to the tail of a fish.

21:37.287 --> 21:38.289
Looked real to me.

21:39.322 --> 21:41.156
All right, I apologize.

21:41.158 --> 21:42.860
Oh! I have a deadline.

21:43.527 --> 21:45.093
Do you know,

21:45.095 --> 21:48.065
corn flakes were invented
to prevent masturbation.

21:49.234 --> 21:50.302
Didn't work.

21:52.370 --> 21:54.771
Oh, Alice Faye just started.

21:56.241 --> 21:57.807
She was a huge star, huge.

21:57.809 --> 21:59.675
And one day, she couldn't take the bullshit

21:59.677 --> 22:00.879
and the backstabbing anymore.

22:01.979 --> 22:04.147
She just walked away from it all.

22:04.149 --> 22:05.247
Ta-da!

22:05.249 --> 22:06.316
That's not bad, is it?

22:06.318 --> 22:07.752
For being shit.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.210
It's not shit.

22:09.086 --> 22:13.120
Listen.

22:13.122 --> 22:16.157
And when I get paid...

22:16.159 --> 22:19.897
I'm so blue without you

22:20.464 --> 22:21.765
we get pie!

22:21.634 --> 22:22.554
Nothing for me.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.398
No, we don't get pie.
I get pie.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.936
You get whatever you want.

22:27.204 --> 22:28.172
Wish me luck.

22:28.641 --> 22:29.981
Good luck.

22:29.906 --> 22:35.111
Then I have only this to say

22:36.880 --> 22:40.750
You'll never know just how much

22:41.385 --> 22:44.989
I miss you

22:46.856 --> 22:51.224
You'll never know just how much

22:51.226 --> 22:53.228
I care

22:57.032 --> 23:00.466
Green.

23:00.468 --> 23:02.636
- I was told red.
- New concept.

23:02.638 --> 23:05.004
That's the future now.
Green.

23:05.006 --> 23:08.308
Oh, and they want them happier, the family.

23:08.310 --> 23:10.211
- Happier? Happier?
- Mmm.

23:10.213 --> 23:11.077
The father looks like

23:11.079 --> 23:12.378
he just discovered the missionary position.

23:12.380 --> 23:13.513
Giles.

23:13.515 --> 23:16.282
Well, what are they supposed
to be happy about?

23:16.284 --> 23:19.119
The client wanted photographs,
I sold them on this.

23:19.121 --> 23:21.154
It's too bad.
This is nice work.

23:21.156 --> 23:24.059
It is nice, isn't it?
I think it's one of my best.

23:25.927 --> 23:28.326
How are you holding up?
You drinking?

23:28.328 --> 23:30.829
No, not a drop. No.

23:30.831 --> 23:34.099
Are you getting any work since
you left Klein and Saunders?

23:34.101 --> 23:36.603
You mean since I was asked to leave by you.

23:36.605 --> 23:39.305
We are not getting into this now.

23:39.307 --> 23:40.909
I wanna come back, Bernie.

23:42.609 --> 23:45.680
We'll see.
Now, do this.

23:47.749 --> 23:49.615
I think we're making great progress.

23:49.617 --> 23:50.853
Good work.

25:49.087 --> 25:50.587
Egg.

26:10.622 --> 26:11.823
Elisa.

26:13.391 --> 26:14.558
What are you doing in there?

26:16.728 --> 26:18.263
Cleaning, huh?

26:19.296 --> 26:20.662
Listen, honey.

26:20.664 --> 26:23.431
Mr. "I pee with my hands
on my hips"

26:23.433 --> 26:25.001
wants to see us both.

26:25.003 --> 26:26.802
"Zelda D. Fuller."

26:26.804 --> 26:29.705
How long have you two known each other, Zelda?

26:29.707 --> 26:31.575
About 10 years, sir.

26:33.243 --> 26:35.208
No siblings, Zelda?

26:35.210 --> 26:36.209
No, sir.

26:36.211 --> 26:38.881
That's not common, is it?
For your people?

26:39.815 --> 26:42.018
My mama died after me.

26:42.885 --> 26:44.420
After I was born.

26:46.989 --> 26:48.458
What does that "D" stand for?

26:49.892 --> 26:52.560
Delilah, sir.

26:52.562 --> 26:53.895
On account of the Bible.

26:53.897 --> 26:56.196
Delilah, she betrayed Samson.

26:56.198 --> 27:00.001
Lulled him to sleep, cut his hair.

27:00.003 --> 27:02.969
Philistines tortured him, humiliated him...

27:02.971 --> 27:04.907
burned his eyes out.

27:06.543 --> 27:08.943
Guess my mama didn't read
the good book close enough.

27:08.945 --> 27:10.147
And you...

27:11.613 --> 27:14.080
"Elisa Esposito."

27:14.082 --> 27:16.250
Doesn't "Esposito" mean orphan?

27:16.252 --> 27:18.984
"Our Lady of Sorrows

27:18.986 --> 27:21.355
They found her by the river

27:21.357 --> 27:22.892
in the water.

27:23.926 --> 27:26.896
It was you that found my fingers.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.129
Oh!

27:30.131 --> 27:31.531
Thanks.

27:31.533 --> 27:33.132
Three hours in surgery.

27:33.134 --> 27:36.436
They rebuilt the first phalanx here...

27:36.438 --> 27:37.838
sutured the tendons.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.609
Don't know if it's gonna take or not.

27:40.676 --> 27:43.743
There was mustard on them.
A paper bag?

27:43.745 --> 27:45.378
It was all we had, sir.

27:45.380 --> 27:48.448
I answer mostly on account that she can't talk.

27:48.450 --> 27:50.384
She can't? She deaf?

27:51.485 --> 27:52.954
Mute, sir.

27:53.620 --> 27:55.256
She said she can hear you.

28:00.261 --> 28:03.128
All those scars on your neck.

28:03.130 --> 28:05.600
That's what did it.
Cut your voice box, right?

28:06.667 --> 28:08.768
She said since she was a baby.

28:08.770 --> 28:11.102
Who would do that to a baby?

28:11.104 --> 28:13.304
The world is sinful.

28:13.306 --> 28:15.107
Wouldn't you say so, Delilah?

28:15.109 --> 28:17.078
Well, let me say this upfront.

28:18.580 --> 28:21.146
You clean that lab, you get out.

28:21.148 --> 28:24.149
The thing we keep in there is an affront.

28:24.151 --> 28:26.752
Do you know what an affront is, Zelda?

28:26.754 --> 28:28.420
Something offensive.

28:28.422 --> 28:30.154
That's right, and I should know.

28:30.156 --> 28:33.991
I dragged that filthy thing...

28:33.993 --> 28:36.528
out of the river muck in South America

28:36.530 --> 28:38.032
all the way here.

28:38.965 --> 28:40.030
And along the way,

28:40.032 --> 28:42.032
we didn't get to like each other much.

28:44.538 --> 28:45.636
Now...

28:46.740 --> 28:50.077
you may think that thing looks human.

28:50.811 --> 28:53.010
Stands on two legs, right?

28:53.012 --> 28:56.149
But we're created in the Lord's image.

28:57.484 --> 28:59.550
You don't think that's what
the Lord looks like, do you?

28:59.552 --> 29:03.088
I wouldn't know, sir,
what the Lord looks like.

29:03.090 --> 29:06.024
Well, it's human, Zelda.
He looks like a human, like me.

29:06.958 --> 29:09.125
Or even you.

29:09.127 --> 29:11.330
Maybe a little more like me,
I guess.

29:14.666 --> 29:16.034
That's all.

29:19.038 --> 29:21.238
General Hoyt, thank you for calling me back, sir.

29:21.240 --> 29:23.507
- Feeling better?
- Oh, yes, sir, much better.

29:23.509 --> 29:24.741
Pain pills is all.

29:24.743 --> 29:26.210
- Close the door.
- You lost two fingers, was it?

29:26.212 --> 29:28.278
Two fingers, yeah.
He got two fingers.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.713
But I still got my thumb,

29:29.715 --> 29:30.981
my trigger, and my pussy finger.

29:30.983 --> 29:32.816
Sounds to me like you'll do all right then.

29:32.818 --> 29:35.018
Yes, sir, that's right.

29:35.020 --> 29:37.019
Looking forward to your visit, sir.

29:37.021 --> 29:39.623
Decisions need to be made about the asset.

29:52.448 --> 29:54.238
Egg.

30:16.293 --> 30:18.359
Flavors of fruity pies await you.

30:18.361 --> 30:20.762
Three new locations in downtown Baltimore.

30:20.764 --> 30:22.463
The future is here.

30:22.465 --> 30:23.664
Get some rest.

30:23.666 --> 30:24.798
Pumpkin, banana...

30:24.800 --> 30:26.767
Pick me up at 9:30.

30:26.769 --> 30:28.705
2130 hours. Yes, sir.

30:29.339 --> 30:32.606
That's-a-great-a-pie.

30:32.608 --> 30:33.741
I'm home.

30:35.110 --> 30:36.477
I made you an omelet.

30:36.479 --> 30:38.513
- Hey, Dad. Guess what?
- No pancakes?

30:38.515 --> 30:40.215
I've been through half the boxes
and I can't find the griddles.

30:40.217 --> 30:42.450
- Guess what?
- I made you a cheese and broccoli omelet.

30:42.452 --> 30:43.517
How are you feeling?
Does it hurt?

30:43.519 --> 30:45.987
- A little bit. Pills help.
- Guess what?

30:45.989 --> 30:47.255
What?

30:47.257 --> 30:50.025
We're burying a time capsule at the new school.

30:50.027 --> 30:51.593
I wanted to ask you...

30:51.595 --> 30:54.962
Do you think we'll all have
jetpacks in the future?

30:54.964 --> 30:56.431
Believe it, son.

30:56.433 --> 30:57.567
Oh! Bus is here.

30:59.134 --> 31:00.670
This is America.

31:02.005 --> 31:03.406
Bye, Dad!

31:07.509 --> 31:08.441
Finish your omelet,

31:08.443 --> 31:09.876
then wash your hands real good...

31:09.878 --> 31:11.545
and come upstairs, sweetie.

31:11.547 --> 31:14.581
I kind of like it here.
The kids like the lawn.

31:14.583 --> 31:17.320
Plus DC is just half an hour away, isn't it?

31:18.820 --> 31:22.324
It's still Baltimore, Elaine.
No one likes Baltimore.

31:25.126 --> 31:26.729
You know what I'm thinking?

31:28.131 --> 31:31.500
I'm thinking I need a new car.

31:38.273 --> 31:40.109
You need a new car, do you?

31:41.808 --> 31:44.312
How about a Cadillac, mister?

31:44.778 --> 31:46.079
Richard.

31:48.717 --> 31:50.115
Oh, Richard!

31:53.220 --> 31:54.419
Sweetie, Sweetie?

31:54.421 --> 31:56.756
Sweetie, your, um, your hand is bleeding.

31:56.758 --> 31:57.990
Silence. Don't talk.

31:57.992 --> 31:59.859
Don't talk.
I want you in silence.

31:59.861 --> 32:02.128
Silent, silent. Yes.

32:03.765 --> 32:04.633
Silence.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.941
Dr. Levensen to Aeronautics.

32:17.943 --> 32:19.180
Dr. Levensen to Aeronautics.

33:23.154 --> 33:24.694
Music.

33:33.330 --> 33:35.000
Music.

34:00.611 --> 34:05.982
Why do robins sing in December?

34:05.984 --> 34:11.652
Long before the springtime is due

34:11.655 --> 34:17.958
And even though it's snowing,
violets are growing

34:17.960 --> 34:22.666
I know why, and so do you

34:23.632 --> 34:28.670
When you smile at me

34:28.672 --> 34:32.909
I hear gypsy violins

34:32.888 --> 34:34.007
Music.

34:35.043 --> 34:39.380
When you dance with me

34:39.382 --> 34:45.585
I'm in heaven when the music begins

34:45.588 --> 34:51.324
I can see the sun when it's raining

34:51.326 --> 34:55.230
Hiding every cloud from my view

34:56.766 --> 35:02.737
And why do I see rainbows
when you're in my arms?

35:02.739 --> 35:04.074
I know why And so do you

35:06.004 --> 35:07.134
Are you okay?

35:08.377 --> 35:14.583
I know why and so do you

35:23.893 --> 35:24.894
Hey!

35:28.397 --> 35:29.930
- Gotcha.
- No, you didn't.

36:05.166 --> 36:09.101
"The sparrow nests on the window..."

36:09.103 --> 36:10.302
What?

36:10.304 --> 36:15.173
"The sparrow nests on the window sill!"

36:15.175 --> 36:17.342
"And the eagle takes the prey."

36:17.344 --> 36:18.512
What?

36:18.366 --> 36:19.366
That's the password...

36:19.408 --> 36:21.748
"And the Eagle takes the Prey."

36:24.622 --> 36:25.832
Let's go.

36:49.729 --> 36:50.859
Bob!

36:50.897 --> 36:52.147
How are you?

36:52.190 --> 36:55.280
I was sitting like a moron on a concrete block

36:55.318 --> 36:57.068
in the middle of nowhere for an hour.

36:57.112 --> 36:59.122
We meet in this shitty restaurant every time!

36:59.156 --> 37:00.406
I could change my mind.

37:02.159 --> 37:03.789
But you don't.

37:03.827 --> 37:04.867
Tell us,

37:04.911 --> 37:06.541
-"Bob."
-Dimitri.

37:06.580 --> 37:08.580
Comrade. Not "Bob."

37:09.332 --> 37:10.282
What is this?

37:10.333 --> 37:11.583
Dimitri.

37:11.626 --> 37:14.376
Anatomical notes...

37:15.213 --> 37:16.583
and...

37:16.631 --> 37:19.930
layout of the laboratory where
the asset is being studied.

37:19.967 --> 37:22.347
Everything we need for the extraction.

37:22.386 --> 37:24.516
I will pass it on to the directorate.

37:24.555 --> 37:27.055
We must do it as soon as possible.

37:28.893 --> 37:29.893
Mihalkov...

37:29.935 --> 37:31.475
This creature...

37:31.520 --> 37:34.150
I think it may be able to communicate.

37:34.190 --> 37:36.200
-Communicate?
-Yes, communicate with us.

37:39.528 --> 37:42.488
I have reason to believe it is intelligent.

37:44.241 --> 37:45.951
It responds,

37:47.017 --> 37:49.267
It responds to...

37:48.287 --> 37:50.497
language, music...

37:52.750 --> 37:55.630
Will you please pass that up also?

37:55.669 --> 37:56.718
I will.

37:58.796 --> 38:01.926
Now... eat, Dimitri.

38:03.009 --> 38:04.849
They call this...

38:09.682 --> 38:12.352
The lobsters are boiled right here.

38:12.393 --> 38:13.893
They squeak a little,

38:13.937 --> 38:15.647
but they are...

38:16.356 --> 38:18.526
so soft and sweet.

38:23.767 --> 38:26.301
Elisa! Hurry, hurry, come on.

38:26.303 --> 38:27.738
I swear to God, girl.

38:29.339 --> 38:31.306
You're doing it again, Zelda.

38:31.308 --> 38:32.877
Oh, give it a rest, Yolanda.

38:58.367 --> 38:59.434
Whoo!

38:59.436 --> 39:01.035
Hey, Zelda, want a smoke?

39:01.037 --> 39:02.702
That shit ain't good for you, Duane.

39:02.704 --> 39:04.173
Yeah, but it feel good.

39:05.175 --> 39:07.541
It does, doesn't it?

39:07.543 --> 39:09.410
Come on, Elisa. Just one.

39:09.412 --> 39:10.945
Come on, come on, come on.

39:10.947 --> 39:13.982
Don't worry about that camera.
We push 'em up at break time.

39:15.083 --> 39:17.754
Mmm-hmm.
- This here is a blind spot.

39:18.687 --> 39:21.422
Man can't make meatloaf...

39:21.424 --> 39:22.989
It adds a little spice.

39:25.794 --> 39:27.194
Sector Five,

39:27.196 --> 39:30.632
must ready energy test starting in two hours.

39:45.714 --> 39:47.581
Fleming, I have to finish some things in here.

39:47.583 --> 39:49.683
Fetch the general, will you?

40:03.832 --> 40:05.267
Aww, you missed me, huh?

40:07.202 --> 40:09.204
I took a candy break.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.508
This is what scares you, huh?

40:15.510 --> 40:16.975
Well, gee, you should be used to it by now.

40:19.881 --> 40:22.981
There you go again, making that god-awful sound.

40:22.983 --> 40:25.986
Is that you crying, huh?
Is that what it is?

40:25.988 --> 40:27.089
Are you hurting?

40:28.255 --> 40:30.954
Or maybe you're angry!

40:30.956 --> 40:33.194
Maybe you'd like to get another bite of me.

40:33.525 --> 40:35.025
Go ahead.

40:38.331 --> 40:39.699
I can't tell.

40:41.335 --> 40:43.067
I mean, are you begging?

40:43.069 --> 40:44.335
Because to me,

40:44.337 --> 40:47.404
it's just the worst fucking
noise I ever heard.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.066
Paging Captain Walters.

41:16.068 --> 41:19.203
Captain Walters, please pick up the courtesy call.

41:19.205 --> 41:20.273
Elisa.

41:21.173 --> 41:22.207
Elisa!

41:33.452 --> 41:35.785
General Hoyt!
Welcome, sir!

41:35.787 --> 41:37.754
Everything's ready.
Glad to have you, sir.

41:37.756 --> 41:39.589
- Good to see you, son.
- Thank you.

41:39.591 --> 41:42.124
Good God Almighty!
Is that it?

41:42.126 --> 41:43.727
Hell of a lot bigger than I thought.

41:43.729 --> 41:45.260
Ugly as sin.

41:45.262 --> 41:48.831
You know, the natives in the
Amazon worshiped it like a god.

41:48.833 --> 41:51.900
Doesn't look like much of a god now, does it?

41:51.902 --> 41:53.369
Well, they're primitive, sir.

41:53.371 --> 41:55.371
You know, they would toss
offerings into the water.

41:55.373 --> 41:57.306
Flowers, fruits, crap like that.

41:57.308 --> 41:59.275
Then they tried to stop the oil drill

41:59.277 --> 42:00.577
with bows and arrows.

42:00.579 --> 42:01.945
That didn't turn out too well.

42:01.947 --> 42:03.882
He's bleeding.

42:05.083 --> 42:06.215
What happened?

42:06.217 --> 42:08.217
It's an animal, Hoffstetler.
Just keeping it tame.

42:08.219 --> 42:11.887
"Oxygen osmosis and dioxide exchange."

42:11.889 --> 42:13.456
What the hell have we got here, son?

42:13.458 --> 42:14.590
This creature, sir...

42:14.592 --> 42:16.025
it can alternate between two

42:16.027 --> 42:17.927
entirely separate breathing mechanisms.

42:17.929 --> 42:20.262
- A mudskipper can do that.
- No.

42:20.264 --> 42:21.864
Look.

42:21.866 --> 42:23.732
You want to put a man in space.

42:23.734 --> 42:25.301
He's gonna have to endure conditions

42:25.303 --> 42:27.736
the human body just wasn't made for.

42:27.738 --> 42:30.573
This gives us an edge against the Soviets.

42:30.575 --> 42:32.607
How long can it breathe outside the water?

42:32.609 --> 42:33.776
The reality is, sir,

42:33.778 --> 42:35.480
we don't know jack shit about this thing.

42:37.881 --> 42:40.748
Well, the Soviets want it.
We know that much.

42:40.750 --> 42:42.350
Those cockeyed bastards.

42:42.352 --> 42:45.287
You know, we let 'em send a dog up into space,

42:45.289 --> 42:46.355
and we get a good laugh.

42:46.357 --> 42:48.656
Then the next thing you know,
they send a human up,

42:48.658 --> 42:49.792
a Russki,

42:49.794 --> 42:52.227
orbiting the planet, doing God knows what.

42:52.229 --> 42:55.263
Who's laughing then?
Khrushchev, that's who.

42:55.265 --> 42:58.133
Let him send a dog up into space, and he laughs.

42:58.135 --> 43:00.601
Then he puts a commie
up in space, and he laughs.

43:00.603 --> 43:02.972
And then he puts
missiles into Cuba.

43:03.606 --> 43:04.938
Have we learned nothing?

43:04.940 --> 43:06.874
Sir, we need to get him back in the water.

43:06.876 --> 43:09.043
See, these scientists,
they're like artists, sir.

43:09.045 --> 43:10.711
They fall in love with their plaything.

43:10.713 --> 43:12.246
Now, right here, see?

43:12.248 --> 43:13.481
Along the middle.

43:13.483 --> 43:15.883
This creature has a thick-jointed cartilage

43:15.885 --> 43:18.519
that separates the primary and secondary lungs.

43:18.521 --> 43:19.720
Am I explaining this correctly, Bob?

43:19.722 --> 43:20.820
Yes, but we have...

43:20.822 --> 43:23.624
It makes the X-rays inconclusive.

43:23.626 --> 43:24.958
In principle, sir, yes. But...

43:24.960 --> 43:26.894
Now, I believe if we want to
get an edge on the Soviets

43:26.896 --> 43:28.963
we need to vivisect this thing.

43:28.965 --> 43:29.929
- No, no.
- Take it apart,

43:29.931 --> 43:31.032
- learn how it works.
- No.

43:31.034 --> 43:33.036
No! That would defeat the purpose.

43:34.237 --> 43:36.239
Sir, he's passed out.
Please.

43:36.905 --> 43:38.304
Put him in the tank.

43:38.306 --> 43:39.475
Let him pressurize.

43:40.341 --> 43:41.810
General Hoyt, sir?

43:43.979 --> 43:45.812
You cannot, under any circumstance,

43:45.814 --> 43:47.016
kill this creature.

43:51.620 --> 43:54.053
Count these stars with me, son.

43:54.055 --> 43:55.455
There are five of them.

43:55.457 --> 43:57.790
Means I can do whatever the hell I want.

43:57.792 --> 43:59.058
Now, you want to plead your case,

43:59.060 --> 44:00.326
I'll listen to it.

44:00.328 --> 44:03.964
But at the end of the day,
it is my damn decision.

44:49.242 --> 44:52.077
So crack the damn thing open,
learn what you can,

44:52.079 --> 44:54.112
and close up shop here.

44:54.114 --> 44:56.514
Give yourself a good pat on the back, Strickland.

44:56.516 --> 44:57.648
You've done it.

44:57.650 --> 44:58.783
Thank you, sir.

44:58.785 --> 45:00.918
Now, hurry up and finish the job, son.

45:00.920 --> 45:02.522
Absolutely, sir.

45:04.156 --> 45:05.623
Get him out?

45:05.625 --> 45:07.558
What are you talking about?

45:07.560 --> 45:09.562
No. Absolutely not.

45:09.550 --> 45:10.800
Why not?

45:10.631 --> 45:12.730
Because it's breaking the law,
that's why.

45:12.732 --> 45:15.002
We're probably breaking
the law just talking about it.

45:14.847 --> 45:16.767
He's alone. All alone.

45:16.803 --> 45:18.638
Oh, he's alone? Oh.

45:19.506 --> 45:20.938
Does this mean that whenever

45:20.940 --> 45:22.239
we go to a Chinese restaurant

45:22.241 --> 45:25.342
you wanna save every fish in the tank?

45:25.344 --> 45:28.314
So what if he's alone?
We're all alone.

45:30.783 --> 45:32.048
The loneliest thing you've ever seen?

45:32.050 --> 45:33.950
Well, you just said it right there.
You just said it!

45:33.952 --> 45:35.954
You called it a thing.
It's a thing. It's a freak.

45:35.783 --> 45:37.703
Say what I sign.

45:37.756 --> 45:38.925
I can understand you.

45:38.744 --> 45:39.914
You're not hearing me.

45:41.372 --> 45:42.582
Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.

45:42.660 --> 45:44.597
Calm down. God, calm down.

45:44.584 --> 45:45.464
Say what I sign.

45:45.631 --> 45:47.199
All right, I will repeat it to you.

45:52.870 --> 45:54.307
"What am I?

45:59.010 --> 46:02.047
"I move my mouth, like him.

46:03.282 --> 46:06.450
"I make no sound, like him.

46:08.921 --> 46:10.722
"What does that make me?

46:13.156 --> 46:15.223
"All that I am...

46:15.225 --> 46:17.692
"all that I've ever been...

46:17.694 --> 46:20.429
"brought me here, to him."

46:20.431 --> 46:23.467
See, you're saying "him."
It's a "him" now.

46:24.569 --> 46:26.502
You just hit me!

46:26.504 --> 46:27.969
Elisa, let go of me.

46:27.971 --> 46:29.204
I'm looking. I'm looking!

46:29.206 --> 46:31.407
You've never hit me.

46:36.681 --> 46:40.251
"When he looks at me, the way he looks at me...

46:41.118 --> 46:45.155
"He does not know what I lack...

46:46.324 --> 46:48.125
"or how...

46:49.492 --> 46:51.028
"I am incomplete.

46:52.963 --> 46:55.530
"He sees me...

46:55.532 --> 46:58.066
"for what I am...

46:58.068 --> 46:59.570
"as I am.

47:03.106 --> 47:04.308
"He's happy...

47:05.142 --> 47:08.245
"to see me, every time...

47:08.977 --> 47:10.380
"every day.

47:11.847 --> 47:15.284
"And now I can either...

47:16.086 --> 47:17.488
"save him...

47:23.026 --> 47:24.261
or let him die."

47:26.094 --> 47:29.096
Oh, God. I'm leaving.

47:29.098 --> 47:32.065
Elisa, no. I have to leave.

47:32.067 --> 47:33.467
Just... Elisa, please stop.

47:33.469 --> 47:35.101
Listen to me.
Just listen to me.

47:35.103 --> 47:36.969
I have to go.

47:36.971 --> 47:39.139
I'm leaving now because, Elisa,

47:39.141 --> 47:40.273
this is very important to me.

47:40.275 --> 47:41.875
This is a second chance for me.

47:41.877 --> 47:44.043
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

47:44.045 --> 47:45.612
Oh, God.

47:45.614 --> 47:46.880
When I come back, we just will not talk

47:46.882 --> 47:48.514
about this ever again.

47:48.516 --> 47:50.050
Elisa, there's...

47:50.052 --> 47:51.117
All right!

47:52.420 --> 47:54.554
What are we?
What are you and I?

47:54.556 --> 47:56.623
Do you know what we are?
We're nothing!

47:56.625 --> 47:58.458
Nothing! We can do nothing!

47:58.460 --> 48:02.295
I'm sorry, but this...
this is just...

48:02.297 --> 48:04.465
Oh, God, it's not even human. God!

48:09.437 --> 48:10.739
What?

48:11.351 --> 48:13.941
If we do nothing

48:14.563 --> 48:15.523
neither are we.

48:27.589 --> 48:28.590
Giles.

48:33.995 --> 48:35.662
- I've been waiting.
- I know. Sorry.

48:35.664 --> 48:36.665
It's okay.

48:37.899 --> 48:39.101
We going in?

48:39.968 --> 48:41.766
You should have just mailed the art.

48:41.768 --> 48:42.733
No.

48:42.735 --> 48:45.603
I want to show it to you and the team in person.

48:45.605 --> 48:47.572
I think it's some of my best work.

48:47.574 --> 48:50.342
And it's green as can be.

48:50.344 --> 48:54.380
It's, uh, it's not a good time.
Maybe later.

48:56.849 --> 48:58.615
Oh. Well, sure.

48:58.617 --> 48:59.786
No problem.

49:01.721 --> 49:04.625
What would be a good time for you, Bernie?

49:12.331 --> 49:14.333
You painted that?

49:14.335 --> 49:15.633
Yeah.

49:15.635 --> 49:17.434
Wowee!

49:17.436 --> 49:18.702
You're good.

49:18.704 --> 49:21.170
Apparently, not as good as a photograph.

49:22.475 --> 49:24.741
But it is good, isn't it?

49:24.743 --> 49:26.743
I couldn't paint anything like that.

49:26.745 --> 49:29.078
Here. On me.

49:29.080 --> 49:30.247
For me?

49:30.249 --> 49:31.748
Well, we don't get many like you in here.

49:31.750 --> 49:34.888
You seem very educated, and I like talking to you.

49:35.955 --> 49:39.290
The thing is that's...

49:39.292 --> 49:41.759
the only reason that I come in here is...

49:41.761 --> 49:43.627
- The conversation.
- And?

49:43.629 --> 49:45.728
The pie is mighty fine, too, isn't it?

49:45.730 --> 49:46.732
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:47.667 --> 49:50.303
It's no key lime, but it's good.

49:54.038 --> 49:56.339
You know, I work alone...

49:56.341 --> 50:00.776
and my best friend's not much
of a conversationalist.

50:00.778 --> 50:02.477
You see, that's part of doing the job here.

50:02.479 --> 50:04.579
It's like being a bartender.

50:04.581 --> 50:06.682
You serve people pie.
You listen to their problems.

50:06.684 --> 50:08.253
You get to know them.

50:10.454 --> 50:12.722
I'd like to get to know you better.

50:12.724 --> 50:14.289
What the hell are you doing, old man?

50:14.291 --> 50:16.559
- Let's sit down.
- Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

50:16.561 --> 50:17.425
Hey, no, no, no.

50:17.427 --> 50:18.961
Not the counter.
Takeout only.

50:18.963 --> 50:20.229
You can't sit there.

50:20.231 --> 50:21.831
If you want something, you order, you take it out.

50:21.833 --> 50:24.267
But it's empty.
The... the counter's empty.

50:24.269 --> 50:26.872
All reserved, all day.
You don't sit down.

50:29.708 --> 50:32.244
Y'all come back now, you hear?

50:33.244 --> 50:34.780
You don't need to talk to them like that.

50:36.212 --> 50:38.446
You should go, too.

50:38.448 --> 50:41.384
And don't come back.
This is a family restaurant.

50:51.928 --> 50:54.429
So come back to my arms

50:55.866 --> 50:59.804
And show me how wrong I can be

51:00.737 --> 51:02.904
I have no one.

51:02.906 --> 51:05.442
And you are the only person that I can talk to.

51:06.243 --> 51:09.513
Now, whatever this thing is...

51:10.214 --> 51:11.748
you need it.

51:12.783 --> 51:14.881
So...

51:14.883 --> 51:16.917
you just tell me what to do.

51:22.124 --> 51:26.126
So come back to my arms

51:26.128 --> 51:28.961
And show me

51:28.963 --> 51:35.401
How wrong I can be

51:35.403 --> 51:38.573
- "All hope fades."
- "As the spring recedes."

51:38.575 --> 51:39.609
Let's go.

51:42.224 --> 51:45.064
Moscow will not support your plan.

51:45.435 --> 51:46.565
Why?

51:47.855 --> 51:49.605
Too risky.

51:50.482 --> 51:51.601
Too soon.

51:51.649 --> 51:52.769
What?!

51:52.817 --> 51:56.697
We only have two choices, Dimitri.

51:57.113 --> 51:57.993
One...

51:58.739 --> 52:01.699
you delay the procedure,

52:01.742 --> 52:03.282
one week, minimum.

52:03.327 --> 52:04.627
It's happening tomorrow.

52:05.788 --> 52:06.738
Which...

52:07.457 --> 52:09.587
brings us to option two.

52:12.462 --> 52:14.592
Israeli "Popper".

52:15.840 --> 52:19.470
You set it next to a fuse box,

52:19.510 --> 52:23.090
it will buy you five to ten minutes in the dark.

52:23.139 --> 52:26.759
No cameras, no containment doors.

52:28.978 --> 52:30.017
Then...

52:33.064 --> 52:35.694
you inject it with this.

52:37.402 --> 52:38.612
Inject it.

52:39.404 --> 52:40.704
Kill it.

52:41.364 --> 52:43.114
Destroy it.

52:43.992 --> 52:45.872
Are you feeling okay?

52:49.956 --> 52:54.466
I came to this country to learn what I could

52:56.213 --> 52:57.423
as a patriot, yes...

52:58.173 --> 52:59.923
but also as a scientist.

53:01.843 --> 53:04.513
There is still so much we can learn.

53:05.597 --> 53:08.396
We don't need to learn.

53:08.432 --> 53:13.192
We need Americans not to learn.

53:19.438 --> 53:22.840
There's a summer place

53:26.145 --> 53:30.547
Where it may rain or storm

53:30.549 --> 53:34.787
Yet I'm safe and warm

53:36.723 --> 53:39.556
Cadillac DeVille.
Best car ever made.

53:39.558 --> 53:43.594
V8, 390 CID, clean and crisp
like a fresh dollar bill.

53:43.596 --> 53:45.227
I'm just idling around.

53:45.229 --> 53:46.662
And I'm just talking.

53:46.664 --> 53:48.464
AM radio, air conditioner,

53:48.466 --> 53:52.435
power windows, power brakes,
power steering, power seats.

53:52.437 --> 53:54.437
All deluxe interior appointment choices,

53:54.439 --> 53:55.971
143 options.

53:55.973 --> 53:57.707
Now, this...

53:57.709 --> 54:00.509
- is the Taj Mahal on wheels.
- Hmm.

54:00.511 --> 54:02.111
I'm not sure about the green.

54:02.113 --> 54:03.513
It's not green, my friend. Teal.

54:03.515 --> 54:05.647
- Well, teal looks green to me.
- But it isn't, see?

54:05.649 --> 54:07.850
It's a limited edition, 12 coats of paint...

54:07.852 --> 54:09.151
polished by hand,

54:09.153 --> 54:11.254
all authentic chrome detailing.

54:11.256 --> 54:13.156
Four out of five successful men in America

54:13.158 --> 54:14.323
drive a Cadillac.

54:14.325 --> 54:15.457
That a fact?

54:15.459 --> 54:16.658
This here is the future.

54:16.660 --> 54:19.095
And you strike me as a man who is headed there.

54:19.097 --> 54:20.796
- Where?
- Why, the future.

54:20.798 --> 54:24.001
You're the man of the future.
You belong in this car.

55:18.689 --> 55:19.853
Wow!

55:19.855 --> 55:22.258
Sir, that is a...
that is a beautiful car!

55:23.593 --> 55:24.792
What can I say?

55:24.794 --> 55:26.596
You gotta feel good driving that, huh?

55:27.729 --> 55:30.163
And what a wonderful shade of green, huh?

55:30.165 --> 55:31.732
Teal.

55:31.734 --> 55:32.903
Teal.

55:41.543 --> 55:43.943
Tomorrow, I'll make a mean meatloaf.

55:43.945 --> 55:44.945
Mmm-hmm.

55:44.947 --> 55:47.617
Just for you, extra raisins.

56:12.874 --> 56:14.708
So, at 5:00 AM, I drive my car

56:14.710 --> 56:15.943
down the loading ramp.

56:15.945 --> 56:18.277
And the shifts are changing, and I have...

56:18.279 --> 56:20.246
How much time do I have?

56:20.248 --> 56:21.846
Five minutes? I'll remember.

56:21.848 --> 56:24.283
5:00 AM, five minutes.
Five-five, five-five.

56:24.285 --> 56:26.786
So, you're going to move the cameras, right?

56:26.788 --> 56:28.853
And I'm gonna be synchronizing our watches

56:28.855 --> 56:30.755
just like they do in the movies.

56:30.757 --> 56:33.426
Oh, God! I'm so proud of you.

56:33.428 --> 56:35.763
God! You're not afraid!

56:37.098 --> 56:39.632
You are? Very?

56:39.634 --> 56:42.435
Don't tell me that.
I'm terrified.

56:47.475 --> 56:49.141
I think this is some of my best work.

56:49.143 --> 56:51.509
"Michael Parker."

56:51.511 --> 56:52.645
It's a little butch.

56:52.647 --> 56:54.716
Yes, age 51.

56:55.948 --> 56:56.950
54?

56:59.485 --> 57:00.688
You don't have to be rude.

57:02.021 --> 57:03.356
57.

57:04.425 --> 57:05.490
If I put the hair on,

57:05.492 --> 57:07.091
I can pull it off.
I can wear this...

57:07.093 --> 57:08.059
or I have...

57:08.061 --> 57:10.762
Thor, go. Off, off, off! Go!

57:10.764 --> 57:11.896
Or I have this.

57:11.898 --> 57:14.198
Now this, I think it says "working man."

57:14.200 --> 57:16.769
But this, now this says...

57:17.805 --> 57:19.771
this says with the butterscotch tie...

57:19.773 --> 57:23.474
This says "casual, but still stylish."

57:23.476 --> 57:26.477
So, you like this?
I agree, I agree.

57:26.479 --> 57:27.912
I think we're ready.

57:48.199 --> 57:50.534
Mr. Strickland!

57:50.536 --> 57:52.268
Sally, could you call Miss Esposito

57:52.270 --> 57:54.006
to clean up a spill?

57:57.476 --> 58:00.576
You know, I can't figure it out myself.

58:00.578 --> 58:02.147
You're not much to look at...

58:03.315 --> 58:04.648
but go figure.

58:04.650 --> 58:06.717
I keep thinking about you.

58:06.719 --> 58:09.719
When you say you're mute,
are you entirely silent...

58:09.721 --> 58:11.789
or do you squawk a little?

58:12.957 --> 58:15.524
Some mutes squawk.
Not pretty, but...

58:15.526 --> 58:16.861
Hmm?

58:19.430 --> 58:21.433
I just want you to know...

58:23.235 --> 58:25.133
I don't mind those scars.

58:25.135 --> 58:27.970
I don't mind that you can't speak, either.

58:27.972 --> 58:30.408
When you come right down to it...

58:31.408 --> 58:32.878
I like it.

58:33.878 --> 58:35.212
A lot.

58:36.414 --> 58:38.149
It kind of gets me going.

58:45.823 --> 58:47.325
I bet I can make you squawk a little.

59:20.657 --> 59:22.426
Hey, honey. You okay?

59:23.594 --> 59:25.626
Hurry up.

59:25.628 --> 59:27.162
My feet are killing me.

59:53.921 --> 59:55.891
We need to delay the procedure.

59:56.691 --> 59:58.558
Knock before you enter my office.

59:58.560 --> 59:59.829
This is urgent!

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.162
Go back out, knock,

01:00:02.164 --> 01:00:03.363
then I'll let you in and we'll talk.

01:00:03.365 --> 01:00:06.033
That's the protocol.
Follow the protocol.

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.340
Come in.

01:00:13.342 --> 01:00:15.177
Would you get the door for me, please?

01:00:20.882 --> 01:00:23.282
See? That's the way.
Now, we talk.

01:00:23.284 --> 01:00:24.816
I need more time.

01:00:24.818 --> 01:00:26.820
Don't let the fact that you feel like a loser

01:00:26.822 --> 01:00:29.088
now that you've let your competitive tendencies...

01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:31.724
I'm not competitive!
I don't want an intricate,

01:00:31.726 --> 01:00:33.161
beautiful thing destroyed!

01:00:37.498 --> 01:00:39.132
This thing dies...

01:00:39.134 --> 01:00:41.902
you learn, I leave, out of here.

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.868
I settle down.

01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:46.672
My family settles down somewhere nice.

01:00:46.674 --> 01:00:48.342
A real city.

01:00:54.115 --> 01:00:56.948
This creature is intelligent...

01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:58.883
capable of language...

01:00:58.885 --> 01:01:01.321
of understanding emotions.

01:01:02.189 --> 01:01:04.254
So are the Soviets, the Gooks.

01:01:04.256 --> 01:01:07.192
And we still kill them, don't we?

01:01:07.194 --> 01:01:09.893
The bottom line is, this isn't a petting zoo

01:01:09.895 --> 01:01:12.330
and I don't wanna be in this shit hole

01:01:12.332 --> 01:01:13.864
any longer than need be.

01:01:13.866 --> 01:01:15.368
Do you?

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:19.407
Bob. Do you?

01:01:21.273 --> 01:01:22.842
No, I don't.

01:01:43.929 --> 01:01:45.932
Hey, what are you waiting for?

01:01:46.666 --> 01:01:48.532
Have you seen Elisa?

01:01:48.534 --> 01:01:50.202
Come on, Zelda!

01:02:03.482 --> 01:02:06.015
Did you move the camera on the loading dock?

01:02:06.017 --> 01:02:07.650
Is that where you're taking him?

01:02:07.652 --> 01:02:09.118
Through the service tunnels?

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.022
That's very smart.

01:02:11.656 --> 01:02:13.589
Who do you work for?

01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:35.812
His water must be kept at 5 to 8% salinity.

01:02:35.814 --> 01:02:37.380
Table salt will do.

01:02:37.382 --> 01:02:41.351
Mix one of these in his water every three days.

01:02:42.253 --> 01:02:45.387
Raw protein diet is a must.

01:02:45.389 --> 01:02:47.055
In five minutes...

01:02:47.057 --> 01:02:48.590
I'll meet you at the loading dock.

01:02:48.592 --> 01:02:50.024
The lights will go out...

01:02:50.026 --> 01:02:51.595
so be prepared.

01:03:11.113 --> 01:03:12.881
Mr. Strickland, sir?

01:03:12.883 --> 01:03:15.248
Twelve hours to the vivisection of the asset.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.653
And I need your signature here, please.

01:03:21.558 --> 01:03:23.857
...this
sudden, clandestine decision

01:03:23.859 --> 01:03:25.360
to station strategic weapons

01:03:25.362 --> 01:03:28.031
for the first time outside of Soviet soil...

01:03:29.065 --> 01:03:31.232
Hold it right there.

01:03:31.234 --> 01:03:33.569
...an unjustified change in the status quo...

01:03:52.053 --> 01:03:54.153
"Michael Parker." Is that you?

01:03:54.155 --> 01:03:55.624
My whole life.

01:04:12.907 --> 01:04:14.409
Are you out of your mind?

01:04:16.544 --> 01:04:20.081
Don't do this, Elisa.
Don't do this!

01:04:25.253 --> 01:04:27.553
What's that?
What's that vehicle?

01:04:27.555 --> 01:04:31.422
Gosh, sir, I'm not sure.
It's a laundry van?

01:04:31.424 --> 01:04:33.460
But it's not scheduled.

01:04:38.165 --> 01:04:39.598
And finally,

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.666
I call upon Chairman Khrushchev

01:04:41.668 --> 01:04:43.304
to halt and eliminate...

01:04:44.203 --> 01:04:46.137
this clandestine, reckless,

01:04:46.139 --> 01:04:48.373
and provocative threat to world peace

01:04:48.375 --> 01:04:51.212
and to stable relations between our two nations.

01:04:57.317 --> 01:04:58.150
Sir?

01:04:58.152 --> 01:05:00.953
- Meet me at the loading dock.
- Sir!

01:05:00.955 --> 01:05:02.554
- Sir, what do you need me to do?
- Get backup.

01:05:06.293 --> 01:05:07.759
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

01:05:07.761 --> 01:05:09.327
Oh, God. I'm not good at this.

01:05:09.329 --> 01:05:11.462
Out of the vehicle now.
I will not say it again.

01:05:11.464 --> 01:05:13.330
- Oh, God. Please don't shoot me!
- Get out!

01:05:13.332 --> 01:05:14.568
Oh, God.
Don't shoot me. Please.

01:05:24.611 --> 01:05:26.780
What are you waiting for?
We're out of time!

01:05:28.448 --> 01:05:29.483
Get out now!

01:05:31.584 --> 01:05:33.318
You have to go. Hurry!

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.819
Oh, woman, we're gonna burn in hell.

01:05:35.821 --> 01:05:37.055
Come on, push.

01:05:37.057 --> 01:05:38.459
Push!

01:05:40.227 --> 01:05:42.459
I swear, I'm not doing this on purpose!

01:05:42.461 --> 01:05:44.664
Mechanical objects and I just don't get along!

01:05:48.699 --> 01:05:49.699
What the...

01:05:49.701 --> 01:05:52.068
She's waiting for you at the dock.

01:06:07.652 --> 01:06:09.385
Who's that man?

01:06:11.790 --> 01:06:13.759
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:06:28.839 --> 01:06:30.642
Are we ready, are we ready?

01:06:37.048 --> 01:06:38.816
He's so beautiful.

01:06:47.526 --> 01:06:48.527
Did I do that?

01:06:51.229 --> 01:06:52.564
I'm just not good at this.

01:06:53.798 --> 01:06:55.198
Move! Move!

01:07:37.574 --> 01:07:39.543
Come on. No.

01:07:43.879 --> 01:07:45.347
No!

01:08:06.334 --> 01:08:08.737
Salt? What are you talking about, salt?

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:12.408
Elisa!

01:09:02.988 --> 01:09:03.991
There.

01:09:21.809 --> 01:09:22.910
Israeli Popper.

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:27.014
You can smell the magnesium.

01:09:28.447 --> 01:09:29.779
Russians hate the Jews,

01:09:29.782 --> 01:09:32.352
but they can't get enough of their gadgets.

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:35.452
How'd they get in here?

01:09:35.453 --> 01:09:38.388
Forged ID, painted plates,
and so on and so forth.

01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:42.059
And they moved the main
video camera on the dock, sir.

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:43.225
Well, no one has to know.

01:09:43.228 --> 01:09:44.962
We got 24 hours before I bounce it up.

01:09:44.964 --> 01:09:46.895
No, I called it in.

01:09:46.898 --> 01:09:48.032
You called it in?

01:09:48.033 --> 01:09:49.568
The moment it happened, I...

01:09:50.268 --> 01:09:51.804
Mr. Strickland, sir.

01:09:53.339 --> 01:09:54.605
What is it, Sally?

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:57.275
Sir, General Hoyt is on the phone.

01:09:57.277 --> 01:10:00.043
That thing was our space dog, Strickland.

01:10:00.045 --> 01:10:01.177
You know that.

01:10:01.179 --> 01:10:03.012
Sir, I'm getting it back.

01:10:03.014 --> 01:10:06.949
I can't be in a negative frame of mind, sir.

01:10:06.951 --> 01:10:08.319
So, you're feeling good?

01:10:08.321 --> 01:10:10.520
Feeling strong.
Getting it back.

01:10:10.522 --> 01:10:13.456
You can get it done.
You're gonna get it done.

01:10:13.458 --> 01:10:15.928
For me, son. For me.

01:10:57.167 --> 01:10:59.867
That's when you're planning on releasing him?

01:10:59.869 --> 01:11:01.471
On the 10th?

01:11:02.707 --> 01:11:04.572
So, what if the rains are late?

01:11:04.574 --> 01:11:06.042
What happens with the canal?

01:11:06.023 --> 01:11:07.653
It will rain.

01:11:07.811 --> 01:11:08.879
All right.

01:11:12.949 --> 01:11:14.418
What's that?

01:11:15.452 --> 01:11:17.989
Let me see it.
Is that for me?

01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.564
Yeah, that's good.
Keep that up.

01:12:01.598 --> 01:12:04.565
Looking like you don't know anything.

01:12:04.567 --> 01:12:08.200
Lord help me, if they ask me if I do.

01:12:08.202 --> 01:12:09.569
I'm not a good liar.

01:12:09.571 --> 01:12:10.870
Except to Brewster.

01:12:10.872 --> 01:12:13.539
It takes a lot of lies
to keep a marriage going.

01:12:13.541 --> 01:12:14.940
All personnel,

01:12:14.942 --> 01:12:17.509
prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.

01:12:17.511 --> 01:12:21.114
Lord! What in the...

01:12:21.116 --> 01:12:22.981
Attention. All personnel,

01:12:22.983 --> 01:12:26.352
prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.

01:12:26.354 --> 01:12:28.488
You done got us in a world of trouble.

01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:29.722
My opinion, we're looking

01:12:29.724 --> 01:12:31.391
at a highly-trained group, sir.

01:12:31.393 --> 01:12:33.159
I'm thinking, conceivably, sir,

01:12:33.161 --> 01:12:35.695
like special forces or so on and so forth.

01:12:35.697 --> 01:12:37.430
Red Army Special Forces?

01:12:37.432 --> 01:12:38.631
Conceivably.

01:12:38.633 --> 01:12:40.065
And they're highly trained.

01:12:40.067 --> 01:12:42.903
They were well-financed, an elite group.

01:12:42.905 --> 01:12:45.871
Highly efficient, ruthless, clockwork precision.

01:12:45.873 --> 01:12:47.805
Infiltration took less than five minutes, sir.

01:12:47.807 --> 01:12:49.675
My conservative estimate is that this was

01:12:49.677 --> 01:12:51.545
a strike force of at least 10 men.

01:13:04.258 --> 01:13:06.126
My master sends this dress.

01:13:07.094 --> 01:13:08.896
Have you always been alone?

01:13:13.534 --> 01:13:15.169
Did you ever have someone?

01:13:16.736 --> 01:13:18.904
Do you know what happened to you?

01:13:18.906 --> 01:13:21.075
Because I don't.

01:13:22.508 --> 01:13:23.840
I don't know.

01:13:23.842 --> 01:13:26.277
I look in the mirror and the
only thing that I recognize

01:13:26.279 --> 01:13:27.848
are these eyes...

01:13:28.681 --> 01:13:30.917
in this old man's face.

01:13:36.021 --> 01:13:38.255
You know, sometimes I think
I was either born too early

01:13:38.257 --> 01:13:39.625
or too late for my life.

01:13:42.695 --> 01:13:46.096
Maybe we're both just relics.

01:13:46.098 --> 01:13:48.132
Security measures have been increased

01:13:48.134 --> 01:13:49.332
to maximum levels.

01:13:49.334 --> 01:13:52.972
Prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.

01:13:56.409 --> 01:13:57.841
Attention.

01:13:57.843 --> 01:14:00.643
Security measures have been
increased to maximum levels.

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:02.778
Sir, I've got them.

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:05.283
Zelda, Elisa. All right.

01:14:08.119 --> 01:14:09.255
Here we go.

01:14:11.222 --> 01:14:12.254
Mmm-hmm.

01:14:12.256 --> 01:14:15.090
Looks like you two punched out
before the incident.

01:14:15.092 --> 01:14:16.860
Still.

01:14:16.862 --> 01:14:19.394
If you know something about what transpired here

01:14:19.396 --> 01:14:22.131
it's your obligation...

01:14:22.133 --> 01:14:23.733
to report any detail,

01:14:23.735 --> 01:14:26.769
no matter how small or trivial it may seem.

01:14:26.771 --> 01:14:28.972
"Trivial" means unimportant.

01:14:28.974 --> 01:14:33.009
I didn't see nothing out of the ordinary, no.

01:14:33.011 --> 01:14:34.443
Or trivial.

01:14:34.445 --> 01:14:36.213
See, my feet were hurting.

01:14:36.215 --> 01:14:37.382
What about you?

01:14:39.483 --> 01:14:41.385
She didn't see anything.

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:44.321
Mmm.

01:14:51.161 --> 01:14:53.228
Hoffstetler, Dr. Hoffstetler.

01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:55.998
Did either of you see him
coming in or out of the lab?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.967
He works there, doesn't he?

01:14:57.969 --> 01:15:02.306
I mean in a different way,
doing something different.

01:15:03.706 --> 01:15:05.843
Something trivial?

01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:07.746
No, sir.

01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:26.095
What am I doing, interviewing the fucking help?

01:15:27.464 --> 01:15:29.166
The shit cleaners.

01:15:30.166 --> 01:15:32.035
The piss wipers.

01:15:35.370 --> 01:15:37.740
You two, go ahead. Leave.

01:15:42.745 --> 01:15:46.215
All right, you're clear.
So, back to work. Go on.

01:15:47.983 --> 01:15:49.419
What'd you say to me?

01:15:51.677 --> 01:15:54.136
F-U-C-K

01:15:54.257 --> 01:15:55.692
What is she saying?

01:15:55.513 --> 01:15:57.393
Y-O-U

01:15:57.459 --> 01:15:58.761
I didn't catch it.

01:15:59.594 --> 01:16:00.926
What is she saying?

01:16:00.928 --> 01:16:03.432
She... she is saying thank you.

01:16:13.609 --> 01:16:14.977
Next!

01:16:32.426 --> 01:16:36.929
I didn't see you last night

01:16:36.931 --> 01:16:38.363
I'm sorry, Ed,

01:16:38.365 --> 01:16:40.032
but now that I'm spending
all day long in the office,

01:16:40.034 --> 01:16:42.535
Carol feels that I... I should
spend my evenings with her.

01:16:42.537 --> 01:16:45.371
Well, if you spend the evenings with her,

01:16:45.373 --> 01:16:46.606
when will I?

01:16:54.114 --> 01:16:57.184
There's only one thing left to do.

01:16:58.185 --> 01:16:59.384
Volunteer.

01:17:28.348 --> 01:17:30.050
No! No, no, no, no, no!

01:17:53.938 --> 01:17:56.306
I wanna get home early.

01:17:56.308 --> 01:17:59.412
Brewster's been in a bad mood lately.

01:18:02.348 --> 01:18:03.347
Holy Jesus!

01:18:03.349 --> 01:18:05.015
What are you doin' standing in the shadows

01:18:05.017 --> 01:18:06.350
of the women's locker room?

01:18:06.352 --> 01:18:08.285
They may be watching me,
and there are no cameras here.

01:18:08.287 --> 01:18:09.320
For good reason.

01:18:09.322 --> 01:18:11.187
But have you caught us at an inconvenient moment!

01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:13.022
I need to know that he's alright.

01:18:13.024 --> 01:18:15.092
- He is.
- When will you release him?

01:18:15.094 --> 01:18:16.293
Soon.

01:18:16.295 --> 01:18:19.399
When the rain fills the canal
that flows to the sea.

01:18:22.533 --> 01:18:24.400
If you need anything...

01:18:24.402 --> 01:18:25.971
Release him. Soon.

01:18:29.473 --> 01:18:31.172
What did she say?

01:18:31.174 --> 01:18:33.846
She said you're a good man, Dr. Hoffstetler.

01:18:36.882 --> 01:18:38.549
My name is Dimitri.

01:18:41.887 --> 01:18:43.355
Honored to meet you.

01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:47.457
Hey, dummy!
Phone call for you.

01:18:47.459 --> 01:18:49.324
It's urgent.

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.434
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:57.318
You're hurt!

01:18:57.434 --> 01:18:58.437
Believe me. I'm fine.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.400
You're bleeding.

01:18:59.504 --> 01:19:00.869
He ate Pandora.

01:19:00.871 --> 01:19:03.271
Wasn't his fault.
He's a wild creature.

01:19:03.273 --> 01:19:05.572
We can't ask him to be anything else.

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:07.375
Elisa, go find him.

01:19:07.377 --> 01:19:09.376
Go. Go.

01:19:09.378 --> 01:19:10.711
Go!

01:19:12.315 --> 01:19:13.415
You're lucky.

01:20:15.778 --> 01:20:17.314
Ow.

01:20:18.713 --> 01:20:21.114
I stayed awake as long as I could.

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:23.085
You know, I'm not even mad anymore.

01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:25.321
Is he all right?
You sure?

01:20:28.623 --> 01:20:29.955
Where you going?

01:20:29.957 --> 01:20:31.426
No, no.

01:20:32.493 --> 01:20:33.325
Okay, don't... no, no.

01:20:33.327 --> 01:20:34.793
Don't... don't play with the kitties.

01:20:34.795 --> 01:20:35.895
No, no.

01:20:35.897 --> 01:20:37.530
Don't play with the kitties.

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:39.300
I'm not... I'm not angry.

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:45.672
Oh, my!

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:55.281
You did that. It's okay.

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:56.986
It's... ooh.

01:21:00.821 --> 01:21:02.357
Enough.

01:21:05.726 --> 01:21:07.594
Oh, God.

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:14.568
Interesting guy.

01:21:18.104 --> 01:21:19.538
All personnel prepare to present

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.739
your identity and clearance cards.

01:21:21.741 --> 01:21:23.276
You wanted to see me?

01:21:26.746 --> 01:21:28.078
How's it going?

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.015
The investigation?

01:21:30.017 --> 01:21:31.652
Well, we have a promising lead.

01:21:32.486 --> 01:21:33.621
Really?

01:21:35.821 --> 01:21:37.089
That's good to hear.

01:21:38.325 --> 01:21:40.056
You joined us in Galveston,

01:21:40.058 --> 01:21:42.059
but where were you before, Hoffstetler?

01:21:42.061 --> 01:21:43.694
- Doctor.
- Excuse me?

01:21:43.696 --> 01:21:45.632
Doctor Hoffstetler.

01:21:47.866 --> 01:21:49.201
Protocol.

01:21:51.103 --> 01:21:53.037
Wisconsin. Madison.

01:21:53.039 --> 01:21:54.238
Oh that's right.

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.774
You gave up a tenure track position, didn't you?

01:21:56.776 --> 01:22:00.414
Gave it all up for us.

01:22:02.981 --> 01:22:04.582
I suppose...

01:22:04.584 --> 01:22:07.952
you'll be getting ready
to leave us now then, huh?

01:22:07.954 --> 01:22:09.688
Only if the creature isn't found.

01:22:12.991 --> 01:22:14.189
Well, what do you think?

01:22:14.191 --> 01:22:15.424
You think we will find it?

01:22:15.426 --> 01:22:17.829
Well, you said you had a lead.

01:22:18.997 --> 01:22:20.499
I do.

01:25:10.797 --> 01:25:12.266
Why you smiling, hon?

01:25:14.168 --> 01:25:15.770
Stop looking like that.

01:25:18.373 --> 01:25:19.841
What happened?

01:25:23.576 --> 01:25:24.778
Why?

01:25:25.944 --> 01:25:27.413
How?

01:25:28.448 --> 01:25:29.550
How?

01:25:30.750 --> 01:25:32.752
Does he have a...?

01:25:38.891 --> 01:25:40.260
Mm-hmm.

01:25:41.728 --> 01:25:42.962
Mm-hmm.

01:25:50.502 --> 01:25:52.704
Oh!

01:25:52.706 --> 01:25:54.772
Never trust a man.

01:25:54.774 --> 01:25:57.107
Even when he looks flat down there.

01:26:11.321 --> 01:26:13.701
Please, come in.

01:26:13.741 --> 01:26:18.121
Your extraction papers will be ready soon.

01:26:19.621 --> 01:26:22.631
First, I have a question for you.

01:26:24.042 --> 01:26:25.672
Yes? Go ahead.

01:26:27.087 --> 01:26:28.797
Would you like some...

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:30.970
butter cake?

01:26:31.008 --> 01:26:31.838
Yes, please.

01:26:38.056 --> 01:26:40.385
The asset after you injected it,

01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.400
what did you do with the corpse?

01:26:43.895 --> 01:26:45.185
I am a little curious.

01:26:48.691 --> 01:26:50.491
I performed an autopsy-

01:26:52.528 --> 01:26:54.528
Unenlightening.

01:26:56.074 --> 01:26:58.114
As Lenin said,

01:26:58.159 --> 01:27:01.619
There is no profit in last week's fish.

01:27:04.707 --> 01:27:07.087
Lenin said that?

01:27:17.288 --> 01:27:18.556
Hmm.

01:27:19.012 --> 01:27:20.922
Great cake!

01:27:20.972 --> 01:27:22.132
Do you have any milk?

01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.400
Perhaps...

01:27:31.108 --> 01:27:32.398
Perhaps...

01:27:37.072 --> 01:27:41.502
Perhaps, you're misremembering.

01:27:45.789 --> 01:27:47.459
Wait for our call.

01:27:49.793 --> 01:27:51.293
Shouldn't be much longer.

01:27:59.427 --> 01:28:02.461
You rang?

01:28:02.463 --> 01:28:05.432
Oh, hi, Maynard.

01:28:05.434 --> 01:28:08.701
We're gonna hold class in the
Amazon jungle in South America.

01:28:08.703 --> 01:28:10.637
South America?
Ooh, man, Dob.

01:28:10.639 --> 01:28:12.372
You're gonna have to get up awful early
in the morning. That's a long hike.

01:28:12.374 --> 01:28:14.273
No, Maynard, we're gonna stay down there.

01:28:14.275 --> 01:28:17.178
- We are?
- Oh, no, you're not coming along, too.

01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:20.749
This is a gelatin parfait.

01:28:21.383 --> 01:28:22.782
You're gonna love it.

01:28:22.784 --> 01:28:23.951
Dad, can we watch Bonanza?

01:28:23.953 --> 01:28:26.353
Bonanza is much too violent.

01:28:26.355 --> 01:28:27.621
You know what I was thinking today?

01:28:27.623 --> 01:28:30.758
We get the kids a P-U-P-P-Y.

01:29:48.033 --> 01:29:49.202
You

01:29:49.242 --> 01:29:50.702
and me

01:29:50.743 --> 01:29:52.743
together.

01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:31.608
Let's go. Come on.

01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:32.845
Let's get out of here.

01:31:19.657 --> 01:31:20.755
What is going on?!

01:31:20.757 --> 01:31:23.125
I've got water pouring into my theater!

01:31:23.127 --> 01:31:25.827
I have four paying customers!
I've got to offer refunds.

01:31:25.829 --> 01:31:27.196
It's probably a pipe.
I'll take care of it.

01:31:27.198 --> 01:31:28.998
- You don't fix it, no more rent!
- I will fix it.

01:31:46.282 --> 01:31:48.819
Elisa?

01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:52.823
Dear God. Elisa!

01:32:22.483 --> 01:32:24.320
I'm toweling my hair!

01:32:25.254 --> 01:32:26.856
It's my hair.

01:32:27.656 --> 01:32:29.655
Ah, just...

01:32:29.657 --> 01:32:31.190
Oh! Look at my arm.

01:32:31.192 --> 01:32:33.426
The wound.

01:32:33.428 --> 01:32:34.829
Look at that.

01:32:35.496 --> 01:32:37.029
Now you said that...

01:32:37.031 --> 01:32:38.297
you know, he was worshiped like a god.

01:32:38.299 --> 01:32:39.867
Now, is he a god?
I don't know if he's a god.

01:32:39.869 --> 01:32:41.967
I mean, he ate a cat, so I don't...

01:32:41.969 --> 01:32:43.569
I don't know, but, I mean,

01:32:43.571 --> 01:32:45.173
we have to keep him around awhile.

01:32:46.674 --> 01:32:48.043
Little while.

01:33:07.328 --> 01:33:08.430
Hello?

01:33:08.436 --> 01:33:11.606
Extraction is ready.

01:33:11.856 --> 01:33:15.946
Same place, in 48 hours.

01:33:17.570 --> 01:33:19.120
48 hours?

01:33:19.906 --> 01:33:21.986
48 hours.

01:34:49.394 --> 01:34:50.529
Your water, sir.

01:34:52.096 --> 01:34:55.364
- And sir, General Hoyt...
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

01:34:55.366 --> 01:34:56.531
Tell him I'm not here.

01:34:56.533 --> 01:34:58.699
Tell him I'll call him back.
Don't put him through.

01:34:58.701 --> 01:35:00.002
No, sir...

01:35:00.004 --> 01:35:01.872
He... he's in your office.

01:35:05.042 --> 01:35:08.110
At this point, our only concern is the asset.

01:35:08.112 --> 01:35:10.549
- Do you have it?
- Still in the winds, sir.

01:35:11.648 --> 01:35:12.917
Well, that won't do.

01:35:13.785 --> 01:35:15.353
Yes, sir, I know.

01:35:17.522 --> 01:35:19.955
You've known me how long, sir?

01:35:19.957 --> 01:35:22.257
Thirteen years.
Battle of Pusan.

01:35:22.259 --> 01:35:23.993
Yes, sir.

01:35:23.995 --> 01:35:27.062
A man is faithful, loyal, efficient all his life.

01:35:27.064 --> 01:35:29.632
All of it. And he is...

01:35:29.634 --> 01:35:30.599
useful.

01:35:30.601 --> 01:35:33.204
And he expects...

01:35:34.838 --> 01:35:37.541
He has certain expectations in return.

01:35:39.476 --> 01:35:42.010
And then, he fails once.

01:35:42.012 --> 01:35:44.778
Only once.
What does that make him?

01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:46.416
That make him a failure?

01:35:50.353 --> 01:35:52.386
When is a man done, sir?

01:35:52.388 --> 01:35:54.555
Proving himself?

01:35:54.557 --> 01:35:56.690
A good man?

01:35:56.692 --> 01:35:58.395
A decent man?

01:36:02.231 --> 01:36:03.868
"Decent?"

01:36:08.303 --> 01:36:12.171
A man has the decency not to fuck up.

01:36:12.173 --> 01:36:13.907
Now that's one thing.

01:36:13.909 --> 01:36:16.143
That's real decent of him.

01:36:16.145 --> 01:36:18.879
But the other kind of decency?

01:36:18.881 --> 01:36:20.014
It doesn't really matter.

01:36:20.016 --> 01:36:23.116
Well sell it, but it's an export.

01:36:23.118 --> 01:36:25.521
We sell it, because we don't use it.

01:36:26.855 --> 01:36:28.721
36 hours from now...

01:36:28.723 --> 01:36:32.528
this entire episode will be over.

01:36:34.396 --> 01:36:35.631
And so will you.

01:36:37.199 --> 01:36:40.367
Our universe will have a hole in it

01:36:40.369 --> 01:36:42.469
with your outline.

01:36:42.471 --> 01:36:44.772
And you will have moved on

01:36:44.774 --> 01:36:47.208
to an alternate universe.

01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:50.279
A universe of shit.

01:36:52.346 --> 01:36:55.016
You'll be lost to civilization.

01:36:57.217 --> 01:37:00.087
And you will be unborn.

01:37:01.421 --> 01:37:03.457
Unmade.

01:37:04.725 --> 01:37:06.295
And undone.

01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:15.503
So go get some real decency, son.

01:37:16.637 --> 01:37:18.571
And unfuck this mess.

01:37:54.474 --> 01:37:56.173
36 hours.

01:37:56.175 --> 01:37:58.142
36 hours. Well, shit.

01:37:58.144 --> 01:37:59.945
You deliver.

01:37:59.947 --> 01:38:02.013
You deliver! Right? Right?!

01:38:39.008 --> 01:38:40.717
Egg.

01:38:48.684 --> 01:38:50.814
You'll...

01:38:50.853 --> 01:38:53.313
never...

01:38:54.999 --> 01:38:56.768
know...

01:38:55.023 --> 01:38:56.733
know...

01:39:04.275 --> 01:39:08.344
You ask me if I'm lonely

01:39:08.346 --> 01:39:11.747
Then I have only this

01:39:11.749 --> 01:39:15.818
To say

01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:17.423
You'll...

01:39:18.655 --> 01:39:20.557
never know...

01:39:21.658 --> 01:39:24.594
just how much...

01:39:26.864 --> 01:39:28.731
I...

01:39:28.733 --> 01:39:31.769
love you.

01:39:33.871 --> 01:39:36.571
You'll...

01:39:36.573 --> 01:39:38.907
never know...

01:39:38.909 --> 01:39:41.142
just how much...

01:39:41.144 --> 01:39:45.213
I care

01:39:51.221 --> 01:39:53.888
And if I try

01:39:53.890 --> 01:39:56.290
I still couldn't hide

01:39:56.292 --> 01:39:58.625
My love

01:39:58.627 --> 01:40:01.762
For you

01:40:01.764 --> 01:40:03.963
You ought to know

01:40:03.965 --> 01:40:09.771
For Heaven told me so

01:40:17.814 --> 01:40:19.879
You went away

01:40:19.881 --> 01:40:25.654
And my heart went with you

01:40:27.090 --> 01:40:28.888
I speak your name

01:40:28.890 --> 01:40:35.861
In my every prayer

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:40.167
If there is some other way

01:40:40.169 --> 01:40:43.436
To prove that I love you

01:40:43.438 --> 01:40:48.144
I swear I don't know how

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:51.878
You'll never know...

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:56.016
if you don't know now.

01:41:18.505 --> 01:41:19.673
Elisa...

01:41:21.976 --> 01:41:23.545
What is it, honey?

01:41:50.235 --> 01:41:51.837
This isn't good.

01:41:54.608 --> 01:41:56.543
I'm gonna call Dr. Hoffstetler.

01:41:58.677 --> 01:42:00.546
We gotta release him tonight, honey.

01:42:01.213 --> 01:42:02.849
I'll come back and help you.

01:42:27.272 --> 01:42:28.606
He's coming out.

01:42:34.613 --> 01:42:36.245
Ah, fuck.

01:42:40.819 --> 01:42:43.186
Sir, if you don't mind me saying, you...

01:42:43.188 --> 01:42:44.556
you don't look so well.

01:42:45.224 --> 01:42:46.592
Shut up.

01:42:48.926 --> 01:42:50.893
Can you smell that?
I mean...

01:42:50.895 --> 01:42:52.996
I think it's your fingers.
They're... they're...

01:42:52.998 --> 01:42:55.467
- Mmm.
- black.

01:43:00.005 --> 01:43:01.839
There he is.

01:43:01.841 --> 01:43:03.505
Doctor-fucking-shirtbird.

01:43:03.507 --> 01:43:05.308
Oh, there's no cause for cursing, sir.

01:43:10.081 --> 01:43:12.050
Get out of the car.
I'm taking it.

01:43:13.251 --> 01:43:14.482
This is my car.

01:43:14.484 --> 01:43:16.017
Get the fuck out.

01:43:16.019 --> 01:43:17.522
Out of my car?

01:43:18.188 --> 01:43:19.790
Did I stutter?

01:44:02.615 --> 01:44:07.165
It's raining like hell, isn't it?

01:44:11.916 --> 01:44:13.256
No password today?

01:44:23.843 --> 01:44:24.933
No-- no-- comrade--

01:44:24.969 --> 01:44:26.549
No, no, no!

01:44:26.596 --> 01:44:27.966
No, please!

01:44:52.582 --> 01:44:54.014
Strickland! Thank God!

01:44:54.016 --> 01:44:56.583
You were speaking Russian...

01:44:56.585 --> 01:44:57.650
Bob.

01:45:09.529 --> 01:45:10.763
What's your name?

01:45:10.765 --> 01:45:13.598
- Hoffstetler.
- No, no. Don't lie.

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:14.899
You don't need to.

01:45:14.901 --> 01:45:17.836
You took a bullet to the gut.

01:45:17.838 --> 01:45:19.071
You're dead.

01:45:19.073 --> 01:45:20.673
I need the names, ranks

01:45:20.675 --> 01:45:23.041
and location of the entire strike team.

01:45:23.043 --> 01:45:24.710
"Strike team?"

01:45:24.712 --> 01:45:27.613
The ones who took the asset!

01:45:36.423 --> 01:45:39.824
This candy.
It's cheap candy, but I love it.

01:45:39.826 --> 01:45:42.627
Ever since I was a kid.

01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:45.896
Now some folks favor
more sophisticated snacks,

01:45:45.898 --> 01:45:49.366
nougat center and all that foo-foo shit.

01:45:49.368 --> 01:45:51.538
But not me, Bob!

01:45:52.372 --> 01:45:53.707
This is it for me.

01:45:56.576 --> 01:45:59.177
Now sometimes if I'm feeling anxious,

01:45:59.179 --> 01:46:00.214
I just bite right into it.

01:46:00.947 --> 01:46:02.914
But mostly,

01:46:02.916 --> 01:46:04.617
I take my time.

01:46:05.118 --> 01:46:06.485
I make it last.

01:46:11.791 --> 01:46:13.424
Names, ranks,

01:46:13.426 --> 01:46:15.427
and location
of the strike team.

01:46:19.130 --> 01:46:21.364
Names! Ranks! Now!

01:46:26.037 --> 01:46:27.540
No names.

01:46:28.808 --> 01:46:30.210
No ranks.

01:46:31.043 --> 01:46:32.579
They...

01:46:33.312 --> 01:46:34.610
They just clean.

01:46:45.823 --> 01:46:48.025
Alright, Brewster, I'm gonna fix your dinner,

01:46:48.027 --> 01:46:50.797
and then I'm gonna run out for a
little while and help a friend.

01:46:52.197 --> 01:46:53.496
Help with what?

01:46:53.498 --> 01:46:55.031
Help a friend.

01:46:57.368 --> 01:46:59.201
Zelda...

01:46:59.203 --> 01:47:00.638
the door.

01:47:04.075 --> 01:47:06.708
Well, you could help me
and answer the door, Brewster.

01:47:06.710 --> 01:47:08.978
You're sitting right here
just ten feet away from it!

01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:10.846
My back's aching me, woman.
Now, move!

01:47:10.848 --> 01:47:13.118
Your back, your back?
Always your back!

01:47:16.353 --> 01:47:17.722
Mr. Strickland.

01:47:18.455 --> 01:47:20.256
What are you doing here?

01:47:20.258 --> 01:47:21.591
Who's that man, Zelda?

01:47:21.593 --> 01:47:22.891
Where is it?

01:47:22.893 --> 01:47:24.426
- What are you talking about?
- Where did you take it?

01:47:24.428 --> 01:47:26.197
- What are you talking about? I... I don't...
- Zelda!

01:47:28.533 --> 01:47:31.601
The thing in the lab.

01:47:32.903 --> 01:47:33.835
Where is it?

01:47:33.837 --> 01:47:35.973
- Listen, fella...
- Sit down!

01:47:45.382 --> 01:47:46.514
I'm sorry, sir.

01:47:46.516 --> 01:47:48.952
If I knew anything, I would surely tell you.

01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:55.560
That story about Samson.

01:47:56.525 --> 01:47:58.660
I never told you how it ends.

01:47:58.662 --> 01:48:03.234
After the Philistines
torture him and blind him...

01:48:04.668 --> 01:48:07.872
Samson asks God for the strength he needs.

01:48:09.572 --> 01:48:12.673
And at the last minute, he is spared.

01:48:12.675 --> 01:48:17.445
And the Lord gives him his strength back...

01:48:17.447 --> 01:48:18.815
one last time.

01:48:21.484 --> 01:48:23.987
And he holds...

01:48:24.854 --> 01:48:28.222
the columns of the temple...

01:48:28.224 --> 01:48:29.690
with his powerful arms.

01:48:29.692 --> 01:48:32.596
And he crushes them.

01:48:44.073 --> 01:48:45.772
And he brings the whole building

01:48:45.774 --> 01:48:47.875
down on the Philistines.

01:48:53.314 --> 01:48:54.814
He dies...

01:48:54.816 --> 01:48:59.121
but he gets every single
one of those motherfuckers.

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:01.089
That is his will!

01:49:05.059 --> 01:49:09.831
Now, do you know what that
particular story means...

01:49:10.765 --> 01:49:13.266
for us, Delilah?

01:49:13.268 --> 01:49:15.735
It means if you know something
you're not telling me

01:49:15.737 --> 01:49:17.704
you're gonna tell me

01:49:17.706 --> 01:49:21.807
either before or after

01:49:21.809 --> 01:49:24.213
I bring this particular temple...

01:49:25.545 --> 01:49:29.247
down upon our heads.

01:49:29.249 --> 01:49:31.682
Gal stole that thing right out the lab,

01:49:31.684 --> 01:49:33.251
whatever it is.

01:49:33.253 --> 01:49:35.619
Mute girl took it.

01:49:35.621 --> 01:49:38.425
I heard my wife talking on the phone about it.

01:49:42.929 --> 01:49:45.230
Thank you very much, Mr. Fuller,

01:49:45.232 --> 01:49:47.034
for your assistance.

01:49:58.146 --> 01:49:59.979
What have you done?

01:49:59.981 --> 01:50:00.779
Zelda.

01:50:00.781 --> 01:50:01.913
I gotta warn her.

01:50:01.915 --> 01:50:03.613
He's going after her.

01:50:03.615 --> 01:50:05.815
You will do
no such thing, woman.

01:50:05.817 --> 01:50:07.151
Why are you worrying about her?

01:50:07.153 --> 01:50:08.551
She broke the law.

01:50:08.553 --> 01:50:10.723
Shut up, Brewster!
You shut up!

01:50:11.423 --> 01:50:13.325
Years, you don't talk...

01:50:14.694 --> 01:50:17.595
and now you can't shut your mouth!

01:50:17.597 --> 01:50:18.965
Damn you, Brewster.

01:50:21.301 --> 01:50:23.201
You wouldn't understand.

01:50:23.203 --> 01:50:27.671
Couldn't understand,

01:50:27.673 --> 01:50:29.806
- Hello?
- Giles, is that you?

01:50:29.808 --> 01:50:31.811
- Yes.
- Okay. Put Elisa on the phone.

01:50:32.412 --> 01:50:33.413
It's Zelda.

01:50:35.114 --> 01:50:38.148
Elisa, honey, make a sound
on the phone if you can hear.

01:50:39.351 --> 01:50:40.352
Okay, good.

01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:42.552
He's coming for you.

01:50:42.554 --> 01:50:45.222
You gotta go now, and you gotta
take that thing with you.

01:50:45.224 --> 01:50:46.324
What? Elisa?

01:50:54.832 --> 01:50:57.435
Hey! Watch out!
Learn how to drive!

01:51:27.465 --> 01:51:28.867
Damn it.

01:51:40.444 --> 01:51:42.045
We have to go.

01:51:44.415 --> 01:51:46.080
Where are you?

01:51:46.082 --> 01:51:47.682
Where the fuck are you?

01:52:59.054 --> 01:53:00.924
You

01:53:01.556 --> 01:53:03.056
and me

01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:05.060
-Together.
-Together.

01:53:05.977 --> 01:53:07.477
No - without me.

01:53:07.477 --> 01:49.401
Without me.

01:54:11.324 --> 01:54:13.126
I do not fail.

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:16.195
I deliver.

01:54:21.335 --> 01:54:22.469
Elisa!

01:54:23.670 --> 01:54:25.339
Elisa.

01:54:34.147 --> 01:54:35.148
No.

01:55:23.328 --> 01:55:24.428
Fuck.

01:55:25.629 --> 01:55:27.264
You are a god.

01:56:01.664 --> 01:56:03.033
Look, man on the ground.

01:56:03.866 --> 01:56:05.302
Watch him.

01:56:12.141 --> 01:56:14.477
You there! Call an ambulance!

01:57:34.288 --> 01:57:36.188
If I told you about her,

01:57:36.190 --> 01:57:38.257
what would I say?

01:57:38.259 --> 01:57:41.193
That they lived happily ever after?

01:57:41.195 --> 01:57:43.729
I believe they did.

01:57:43.731 --> 01:57:47.733
That they were in love,
that they remained in love?

01:57:47.735 --> 01:57:49.737
I'm sure that's true.

01:57:50.504 --> 01:57:52.573
But when I think of her...

01:57:53.508 --> 01:57:55.708
of Elisa...

01:57:55.710 --> 01:57:58.676
the only thing that comes to mind is a poem

01:57:58.678 --> 01:58:03.614
whispered by someone in love,
hundreds of years ago.

01:58:03.616 --> 01:58:06.586
Unable to perceive the shape of You

01:58:07.487 --> 01:58:10.322
I find You all around me

01:58:10.324 --> 01:58:13.728
Your presence fills my eyes with Your love

01:58:14.728 --> 01:58:17.027
It humbles my heart

01:58:17.029 --> 01:58:19.063
For You are everywhere

01:58:56.767 --> 01:58:59.502
You'll never know

01:58:59.504 --> 01:59:04.676
Just how much I miss you

01:59:09.047 --> 01:59:15.888
You'll never know
just how much I care

01:59:21.526 --> 01:59:24.826
And if I tried

01:59:24.828 --> 01:59:31.769
I still couldn't hide
my love for you

01:59:34.138 --> 01:59:37.205
You ought to know

01:59:37.207 --> 01:59:41.245
For haven't I told you so

01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:46.581
A million or more times?

01:59:46.583 --> 01:59:48.717
You went away

01:59:48.719 --> 01:59:53.992
And my heart went with you

01:59:58.395 --> 02:00:04.902
I speak your name
in my every prayer

02:00:09.038 --> 02:00:13.240
If there is some other way

02:00:13.242 --> 02:00:17.211
To prove that I love you

02:00:17.213 --> 02:00:21.751
I swear I don't know how

02:00:23.219 --> 02:00:30.326
You'll never know
if you don't know now

02:01:24.547 --> 02:01:29.514
You'll never know
just how much

02:01:29.516 --> 02:01:33.120
I miss you

02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:43.964
You'll never know
just how much I care

02:01:48.970 --> 02:01:56.140
You said goodbye
Now stars in the sky

02:01:56.142 --> 02:02:02.014
Refuse to shine

02:02:02.016 --> 02:02:04.616
Take it from me

02:02:04.618 --> 02:02:10.321
It's no fun to be alone

02:02:10.323 --> 02:02:14.526
With moonlight and memories

02:02:14.528 --> 02:02:19.363
You went away and my heart

02:02:19.365 --> 02:02:22.703
Went with you

02:02:26.506 --> 02:02:30.340
I speak your name

02:02:30.342 --> 02:02:34.614
In my every prayer

02:02:35.849 --> 02:02:41.152
If there is some other way

02:02:41.154 --> 02:02:44.721
To prove that I love you

02:02:44.723 --> 02:02:49.761
I swear I don't know how

02:02:50.929 --> 02:02:56.165
You'll never know
if you don't

02:02:56.167 --> 02:02:59.171
Know

02:03:00.238 --> 02:03:03.776
Now
