WEBVTT

00:00.668 --> 00:01.835
Hey, okay, Mom, um,

00:01.902 --> 00:03.137
Chale just got off the phone
with his parents.

00:03.204 --> 00:04.905
Oh, please tell me
June 17th works
for the wedding.

00:04.972 --> 00:06.607
Luckily, my mother
had to pull out

00:06.674 --> 00:08.242
of her archery tournament.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.578
She refuses to wear
her new glasses,

00:10.644 --> 00:13.514
and last month,
she killed a dairy cow.

00:15.649 --> 00:16.850
S-So...?

00:16.917 --> 00:19.987
So, what Chale is trying
to say is, we're good.

00:20.054 --> 00:20.988
The 17th is on.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.190
Okay, great!

00:22.256 --> 00:23.824
So, we got -- we got parents,
we got deejay,

00:23.891 --> 00:24.958
we got reception hall.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.494
Yeah, not only
does that date work,

00:26.560 --> 00:28.028
it's the only date
that does work.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.898
Hey, honey, um, looks like
June 17th for the wedding,

00:30.964 --> 00:33.734
so let's talk to Father Philip
about reserving the church.

00:33.801 --> 00:36.036
Hold up. The 17th?

00:36.104 --> 00:37.471
Nobody checked with me.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.707
My dance card
is pretty full. Hold on.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.643
Yeah, no go.

00:42.710 --> 00:43.811
Mets are playing
the Padres,

00:43.877 --> 00:45.379
and I'm probably going
with the boys.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.981
You'd choose a Met game
over your daughter's wedding?

00:52.586 --> 00:53.854
You think
I would really do that?

00:53.921 --> 00:55.356
You're my little peanut,
and I love you.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.624
Come on.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.626
You just realized
it's an away game, didn't you?

00:58.692 --> 01:01.295
I did.
They're in San Diego.

01:01.362 --> 01:05.899
* I am not your ordinary guy

01:14.041 --> 01:16.043
Mass is really packed.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.045
I-I-- It's gonna be tough
finding a spot.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.681
Yeah, well, that's why I said
we should have left earlier.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.516
Ooh, ooh! Family getting in
an SUV right there.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.385
Yeah, exactly --
it's a family, Donna.

01:24.452 --> 01:25.919
That's three kids
you got to get buckled in,

01:25.986 --> 01:28.356
hand out juice boxes
before you even start the car.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.390
It's a whole ordeal.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.658
Oh, oh! Dad, look.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.393
11:00 -- single male
headed towards his Corolla.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.527
Yep. I'm on it.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.795
That guy?
He's on his phone.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.130
Yeah. He's got pep
in his step.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.665
He's got things going on.
I like it.

01:37.731 --> 01:38.732
He's already in his car.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.368
Ah! I think
you're making a mistake.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.803
Kids are already
in their seats.
They have their juice.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.705
Yeah, that family's
pulling out any second.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.507
Are you kidding me?
He's adjusting the mirrors.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.776
Oh, come --
It's a straight backup, guy!
Yes.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.110
Car's about to pull out.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.179
You already got it
in reverse!

01:51.245 --> 01:52.680
Take your foot
off the brake, idiot!

01:52.746 --> 01:54.615
Church parking lot, Dad.
Yep. Gotcha.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.150
The space is open.
Go, go, go!

01:56.217 --> 01:57.418
All right.
( Engine revs )

01:57.485 --> 01:58.419
( Tires screech )
Oh, man!

01:58.486 --> 01:59.487
Aah! Old lady.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.389
Really, Mrs. Dooley?!

02:01.455 --> 02:02.523
With your big calves.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.524
Hustle!

02:03.591 --> 02:04.925
( Horn honks )

02:04.992 --> 02:07.395
Did you see that? He pulled in
right in front of me!

02:07.461 --> 02:09.163
That was my spot!
That son of a...

02:09.230 --> 02:11.131
Church, Dad!
Yep. Gotcha.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.066
Don't we know that guy?

02:13.133 --> 02:14.402
That's Terry Labasco.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.637
Who's Terry Tabasco?

02:16.704 --> 02:19.607
Labasco. He's this guy
your dad hates
from high school.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.375
I don't hate him, okay?
I don't hate anybody.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.177
Hey, we don't use
that word "hate"
in this family.

02:25.246 --> 02:28.249
K-Gable!
Hey, Meatball!

02:28.316 --> 02:29.650
Were you waiting
for that spot?

02:29.717 --> 02:30.651
Did you beep?

02:30.718 --> 02:32.520
I can't hear a thing
in my Benz.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.954
With those Bose speakers
playing,

02:34.021 --> 02:36.089
it sounds like Tony Bennett's
in the back seat.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.391
( Both laugh )

02:37.458 --> 02:40.027
It's fine. I-I'll just find
another place to park.

02:40.093 --> 02:42.496
Okay. If I was you,
I'd park it at Dunkin' Donuts.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.498
That way, you can kill
a couple of birds
with one stone.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.234
( Both laugh )

02:48.302 --> 02:49.503
Man, I hate that guy.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.171
**

02:51.239 --> 02:53.374
All right, now, your mother
and I got to talk
to Father Philip,

02:53.441 --> 02:55.576
so, uh, why don't you
go find some seats, okay?

02:55.643 --> 02:56.744
Okay.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.315
Terry!
I hear Bridget's engaged!

03:01.382 --> 03:02.516
Congratulations!

03:02.583 --> 03:03.684
Thank you, Father.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.052
We are so excited.

03:05.118 --> 03:08.289
Um, we'd like to reserve
the church for June 17th.

03:08.356 --> 03:09.757
I'm sorry --
June 17th?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.859
Yeah, um, 'cause that actually
was the date

03:11.925 --> 03:13.961
that we wanted to reserve
for Kendra's wedding, so --

03:14.027 --> 03:18.366
Well, you know, we call this
in theology "awkward."

03:18.432 --> 03:20.200
Well, Father,
I did kind of ask first.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.702
Wait -- But I --
But I waved,

03:21.769 --> 03:23.170
and I kind of
wiggled my fingers,

03:23.237 --> 03:25.573
which is sign language
for "We need to talk," so...

03:25.639 --> 03:27.708
Um, I've got
a ton of deaf friends.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.577
Pretty sure
that's not true.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.613
Okay, look, you stole
my parking spot.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.348
You're not stealing
our wedding date, okay?

03:34.415 --> 03:35.683
I didn't take your spot,
Gable.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.184
I just didn't want
to be late for Mass,

03:37.251 --> 03:38.652
like some families are.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.522
Okay. I was waiting
for Mrs. Dooley.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.457
I try every day
to put others before me --

03:43.524 --> 03:45.893
mostly because of
your teachings, Father.

03:45.959 --> 03:49.229
Thank you, Kevin, but, guys,
this is not a competition.

03:49.297 --> 03:50.230
Of course not.
No!

03:50.298 --> 03:51.765
It's just that
the thing is,

03:51.832 --> 03:53.233
our son-in-law's
parents,

03:53.301 --> 03:55.202
they are traveling
from England,

03:55.269 --> 03:56.770
and so it's really
the only date

03:56.837 --> 03:58.238
that works
for all of us.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.140
I got peeps
coming from Wichita.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.110
Wichita.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.813
I could ride a bike
from Wichita, okay?

04:05.879 --> 04:08.649
Enough with the eyes, okay?
I get it.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.952
The bottom line is,
I cannot budge on the date.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.354
Well, neither can we.
But --

04:13.421 --> 04:15.356
Well, then,
we've got ourselves
a situation, pork chop.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.491
Well, then, maybe we do,
because, listen to me --
Well, well --

04:17.558 --> 04:20.060
Guys, guys, guys, please.
Let me think about this.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.529
I'm running
on two hours' sleep.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.431
Sister Mary
polished off the Red Bull.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.998
I will get back to you.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.934
Absolutely. Thank you, Father.
God bless.
Thank you, Father.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.436
Thank you.
Y-yes.
God bless you, Father.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.203
God bless you all.
And everybody here
at Saint Rocco's.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.673
Everybody. Blessings,
blessings. Blessings.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.375
**

04:34.442 --> 04:36.410
Congratulations
to Father Benedict,

04:36.477 --> 04:39.046
who crushed
in the dance competition

04:39.112 --> 04:40.648
at the parish picnic.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.283
Pfft! Robot.
Who knew?

04:43.351 --> 04:45.553
Unfortunately,
he did shatter his knee,

04:45.619 --> 04:47.455
so, bottom line,
he's not gonna be able to host

04:47.521 --> 04:48.989
this Saturday's
pancake breakfast.

04:49.056 --> 04:52.225
So if I can get someone
to fill in,

04:52.292 --> 04:53.661
I'd really owe them.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.664
Sign-up sheet for that
is on the bulletin board
in the hallway.

04:56.730 --> 05:00.167
It's also time
for our annual mission trip.

05:00.233 --> 05:01.234
( Suspenseful music plays )

05:01.301 --> 05:02.870
If you've never been
a part of this,

05:02.936 --> 05:06.607
I'm telling you,
it's a life-changing event.

05:06.674 --> 05:10.143
This year, we will be
heading to Guatemala

05:10.210 --> 05:12.413
to help the people there.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.548
We're roughing it.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.585
Hey, hey!

05:17.651 --> 05:20.020
No, no, no, no, no!

05:20.087 --> 05:21.288
You looking for this?

05:21.355 --> 05:23.190
Well, you ain't got a shot
at getting that date.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.926
You know why? 'Cause once
Father Philip sees me...

05:25.993 --> 05:29.630
teach breastfeeding
to first-time mothers?

05:29.697 --> 05:33.000
Oh. Meatball,
you grabbed the wrong one.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.935
Now while you're busy
taking off your blouse,

05:35.002 --> 05:36.336
I'll be flipping
and dishing out pancakes

05:36.404 --> 05:37.705
all the way
to my kid's wedding.

05:37.771 --> 05:38.839
Sweet.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.841
**

05:43.744 --> 05:45.913
Hey, baby.
I made you lunch.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.180
Whoa. Nice tool belt.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.916
Is that the last belt
you got that fits?

05:48.982 --> 05:50.718
( Stammers mockingly )

05:52.453 --> 05:54.221
Just doing
a little volunteering
down at the church.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.723
From time to time,
I like to give back.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.190
( Chuckles )
Since when?

05:57.257 --> 06:00.661
Ah, it's been, what, uh,
got to be three days,
huh, hon?

06:00.728 --> 06:03.163
Since we've been trying
to lock down the date

06:03.230 --> 06:04.264
for your wedding.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.099
Wait -- "trying"?
Is there a problem?

06:06.166 --> 06:07.935
We didn't want to tell you,
but the Labascos

06:08.001 --> 06:09.937
kind of want the same date
for their daughter's --

06:10.003 --> 06:13.040
( Babbles )

06:13.106 --> 06:14.475
We're gonna get you the date,
all right?

06:14.542 --> 06:15.609
And you know why?

06:15.676 --> 06:16.910
'Cause good things
happen to good people,

06:16.977 --> 06:18.345
and we --
we're good people.

06:18.412 --> 06:19.547
Exactly.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.348
Now, if Terry Labasco
tries any crap today,

06:21.415 --> 06:22.483
you take him down.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.752
Oh, he's going down
"good people" style.

06:24.818 --> 06:28.522
Dad, the Gables
have assured me June 17th,

06:28.589 --> 06:30.357
so, uh,
we can lock you in.

06:30.424 --> 06:33.293
Well, consider me
locked, then.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.394
Uh-oh!

06:34.462 --> 06:36.764
What is that
I feel behind me?

06:36.830 --> 06:39.900
Hello, Chalie-puss!

06:39.967 --> 06:41.802
( Chuckles )
Hello, Mums.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.370
Hi, guys!
( Giggles )

06:43.437 --> 06:44.605
Oh. Hello, Kendra.

06:44.672 --> 06:45.973
Hello.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.444
I see you're in
your waitress uniform.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.414
Uh --
Okay, uh,
I'll let you guys go,

06:54.482 --> 06:56.283
and, uh, I'll see you
on the 17th.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.351
Bye-bye, Chalie-puss!
( Smooches )

06:58.418 --> 07:01.254
Bye, guys!
I can't wait to see...

07:01.321 --> 07:03.290
you.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.625
( Chuckles )

07:04.692 --> 07:05.926
You know,
if I didn't know any better,

07:05.993 --> 07:08.228
I'd say your parents
aren't crazy about me.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.697
Hey, that's not true!

07:11.164 --> 07:14.334
Okay, maybe they're not
100% sold on you.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.770
Sold on me?
Well, you're the one
doing the selling.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.371
I mean, what are you
telling them?

07:18.438 --> 07:22.242
Well, I've been hitting the
law-school thing pretty hard,

07:22.309 --> 07:25.879
but they really locked in
on the pizza-waitress thing.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.347
Oh, and the short temper.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.381
Short temper?!

07:28.448 --> 07:29.783
Yeah, that one.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.521
So it's true --
They don't like me.

07:33.587 --> 07:36.557
Well, look, at least
my parents are in England,

07:36.624 --> 07:39.493
so we just tap a button
and they go away.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.695
What's that
supposed to mean?

07:41.762 --> 07:45.733
Just that you have to suffer
a Skype for 30 seconds,

07:45.799 --> 07:48.636
and I have had to suffer
for a year.

07:48.702 --> 07:51.238
( Scoffs )
Like it's been that bad.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.140
What?!

07:53.206 --> 07:54.508
With your father?

07:54.575 --> 07:57.277
( As Kevin )
"Oh, uh, guy, guy!
That's the good bologna.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.246
Yeah, don't touch it.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.815
Guy, if that's the last
ice cream sandwich,

08:01.882 --> 08:04.985
I'm gonna end your life."

08:05.052 --> 08:08.021
( Normal voice ) He threatened
to kill me over ice cream.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.356
Is it really
that hard to take?

08:09.422 --> 08:11.124
They let you live here
for free.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.594
Oh, great. Thank you
for reminding me.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.830
No one's said that to me
in, like, over 12 minutes.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.599
All right, you know what?
I got to go to work.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.233
I just came in here
to kiss you goodbye.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.369
Oh, great.
Well, let's tick that
off your to-do list.

08:22.435 --> 08:23.436
Fine!

08:24.605 --> 08:25.539
Mmm!

08:25.606 --> 08:28.441
Oh, fireworks!

08:28.508 --> 08:31.645
Yeah, right back at you,
Chalie-puss.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.547
**

08:33.614 --> 08:34.948
Oh, hey,
Father Philip.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.383
Dimmer switch
is installed.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.251
Oh, a little
late-night Bible reading,

08:38.318 --> 08:39.753
but you don't have
enough light?

08:39.820 --> 08:41.154
You just kick it up
a notch.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.625
Oh --
Some older nuns visiting,

08:44.692 --> 08:46.894
not quite the lookers
they once were.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.428
You bring it down.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.799
Very nice, Kevin.
Thank you.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.768
Uh, Father, I noticed
that the door was creaking,

08:54.835 --> 08:56.236
so I replaced the hinges,

08:56.303 --> 08:58.305
and you know
what they sound like now?

08:58.371 --> 09:00.407
That.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.809
Father, I put up
those pictures right there,

09:01.875 --> 09:02.876
so I just want you
to know that.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.244
Did you use a level,
Kevin?

09:04.311 --> 09:06.079
They look a little crooked.
Maybe it's me.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.915
No, it's you.
They're perfect.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.249
All right, guys, listen --

09:09.316 --> 09:11.118
the church appreciates
all the work that you've done,

09:11.184 --> 09:13.486
but I think maybe it's time
we call it a day.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.488
Absolutely, Father.
I agree. I agree.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.257
Although, Father, I did notice
a few marks on the floor.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.892
I could buff those out
in the blink of an eyeball.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.560
Really not necessary.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.199
( Rock music plays )

09:36.109 --> 09:37.444
Hey, Gable!

09:37.510 --> 09:39.479
That's a cute little machine
you got there.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.548
My grandma's got one
just like it.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.884
They let her use one of these
in prison?

09:43.951 --> 09:45.686
Yeah, you know what,
Labasco?

09:45.753 --> 09:47.988
You're not winning
this thing. I am.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.357
Why don't you do yourself
and that poor machine a favor?

09:50.423 --> 09:53.661
Unsaddle, go home,
pick another wedding date.

09:53.727 --> 09:54.795
Not happening.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.730
Here's something
you don't know about me.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.232
What, your cholesterol's
under 550?

09:59.299 --> 10:01.268
No -- I never give up!

10:01.334 --> 10:03.336
Rrrrrrrr!!

10:03.403 --> 10:05.338
( Grunting )

10:07.841 --> 10:09.309
Hey! Hey! Hey!

10:09.376 --> 10:10.911
What is going on?

10:10.978 --> 10:13.213
Gable's out of control,
Father. He's been...

10:13.280 --> 10:15.282
No, I-I was just cleaning
the floors.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.484
Just be more careful.
I have a lot
on my plate today.

10:17.550 --> 10:18.752
Sister Connie's sick,

10:18.819 --> 10:21.889
and I have no one
to teach her Catechism class.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.957
Oh, I think you do.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.093
**

10:26.159 --> 10:29.129
I am Mr. Gable, and I will be
filling in for Sister Connie,

10:29.196 --> 10:30.998
who's a little bit
under the weather.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.700
Is Sister going to die?

10:32.766 --> 10:33.566
What?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.235
Oh.
No, no, no, no, no.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.137
I mean, I guess someday,
she's gonna die.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.206
I mean, we're all gonna die
someday, right?

10:39.272 --> 10:40.373
We're gonna die?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.409
Uh, you know what?
Let's switch it up.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.777
Everybody stand up.
We're gonna stretch it out.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.145
Let's stretch things out --
Let's get the arms going,

10:45.212 --> 10:46.546
get some blood flowing.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.515
Now let's go the other way,
circles back the other way.

10:48.581 --> 10:49.683
This is weird.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.551
No, no, no.
This is Catechism.

10:51.618 --> 10:55.322
Aren't we supposed to be
learning about religion?

10:56.523 --> 10:58.258
Okay, fine.
Everybody sit down.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.027
Okay, let's --
let's talk about religion.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.862
Uh...

11:01.929 --> 11:03.363
What do you want to know?

11:03.430 --> 11:06.233
Is God real?
'Cause my uncle says he's not.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.768
Of course God's real.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.036
How do you know?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.505
Well, um...

11:12.572 --> 11:13.841
Okay.

11:13.907 --> 11:17.510
**

11:17.577 --> 11:20.180
1986 -- The Mets
are one out away

11:20.247 --> 11:23.183
from losing the World Series
to the Boston Red Sox.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.252
Mookie Wilson hits
an easy ground ball

11:25.318 --> 11:27.487
towards first base
that will end it all.

11:27.554 --> 11:32.225
Across town, a wiry
16-year-old from Massapequa
says a prayer,

11:32.292 --> 11:34.261
and God heard me.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.929
'Cause He opened the legs
of the great Bill Buckner,

11:35.996 --> 11:39.800
that ball rolled through,
and the Mets won the Series.

11:39.867 --> 11:43.670
Um, didn't people also pray
for the Red Sox to win?

11:43.737 --> 11:45.672
Mm, apparently,
not hard enough, right?

11:45.739 --> 11:47.140
( Chuckles )

11:47.207 --> 11:48.776
Kevin?
Oh.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.778
I was kind of hoping
you'd stick
to the source material.

11:50.844 --> 11:51.945
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.513
Um, I hit them
with a little straight talk,

11:53.580 --> 11:54.782
and then
I get to this stuff.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.751
Actually, Father,
if you don't mind, uh...

12:02.355 --> 12:05.358
Kids, we know
that God exists,

12:05.425 --> 12:09.029
because, well,
He is existence.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.663
He's in every single one
of us.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.833
He's in our heart,
He's in our minds,

12:12.900 --> 12:15.268
His beauty's in the sun
that rises,

12:15.335 --> 12:19.139
and the moon that gives off
that perfect night light.

12:19.206 --> 12:23.310
The fact that we exist
is proof positive

12:23.376 --> 12:27.047
that God Himself exists.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.648
( Groans )

12:30.683 --> 12:33.686
Actually,
that is spot-on.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.855
( Applause )

12:34.922 --> 12:36.857
Oh, no, no.
No, no.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.726
That a-and --
and the Mets.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.061
The sun, the moon,
and the Mets.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.495
It's all spot-on.
Spot-on.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.866
**

12:45.933 --> 12:47.200
Hey.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.668
We need to up our game.

12:48.735 --> 12:49.769
What?

12:49.837 --> 12:51.438
Labasco --
He's leaving us in the dust.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.806
I can't stand the guy!

12:52.873 --> 12:55.542
Okay, all right. Relax,
because I'm way ahead of you.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.211
There is a big fundraising
dinner at the church.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.948
I'm gonna make a pan
of my famous teriyaki chicken.

13:01.014 --> 13:01.748
Hmm?

13:01.815 --> 13:03.783
Oof.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.218
What?
Well, it's mostly famous

13:05.285 --> 13:07.287
for me not being able
to go to work the next day.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.491
Uh, what should I make,
then?

13:11.558 --> 13:13.093
Two words -- lasagna.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.595
Okay. ( Snaps fingers )
That's one word.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.365
No, it's Italian.
"La zagna" -- "the zagna."

13:18.431 --> 13:19.599
( Door opens )

13:19.666 --> 13:21.234
Hey, guys.
Hey.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.703
Um, okay, so,
I-I know that you guys

13:23.770 --> 13:25.772
have been trying really hard
to get that wedding date --

13:25.839 --> 13:27.841
Yeah, and we're gonna get it
for you. You're good.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.742
Yeah, well, we were
actually thinking, you know,

13:29.809 --> 13:31.811
maybe it'd be better
to push it back a bit.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.713
What's...the matter?

13:33.780 --> 13:36.783
Well, it turns out Chale and I
still have
a lot to talk about.

13:36.850 --> 13:39.052
Y-Yes, this morning,
we discovered

13:39.119 --> 13:42.956
we have some issues
festering beneath the surface.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.491
Okay, well, you're
getting married on the 17th,

13:44.557 --> 13:47.460
so slap a Band-Aid
on your issues, okay?

13:47.527 --> 13:48.795
'Cause there's no way
Terry Labasco

13:48.862 --> 13:50.230
is winning this one.

13:50.297 --> 13:53.466
**

13:53.533 --> 13:55.135
Hey.
That's my spot.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.669
What, are you trying
to take my job?

13:56.736 --> 13:59.406
( Laughs )
That's a good one, Father.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.541
No, no, no,
I -- I-I heard you saying

14:01.608 --> 14:03.843
how run-down
the confessional was getting,

14:03.911 --> 14:05.512
so I just -- I just wanted
to fix the hinge,

14:05.578 --> 14:07.948
and I replaced the ripped
cushion with a new one.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.616
W-Why don't you give it
a try?

14:09.682 --> 14:10.717
All right.

14:12.485 --> 14:15.188
Oh, wow!
This is a sweet ride!

14:15.255 --> 14:15.989
Huh?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.224
Yeah.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.525
Thank you, Kevin.

14:18.591 --> 14:19.826
Don't thank me.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.262
Thank the Lord.
He's the one guiding me.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.669
( Groans )

14:40.180 --> 14:42.282
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.253
It's been three weeks
since my last confession.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.988
Oh, uh, no, no.
I'm n--

14:48.055 --> 14:50.723
I have been very unkind
to a fellow parishioner.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.559
It goes back
to grade school.

14:52.625 --> 14:56.029
Who knew that Kevin Gable
would turn out to be
a good guy?

14:57.630 --> 14:58.865
Go on.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.372
Back in the day,
I was so jealous of him.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.574
He was so funny.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.609
He was a --
He was a large boy.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.847
Everybody loves the large boy,
you know?

15:17.250 --> 15:20.653
And now I'm just acting
like a jerk all over again,

15:20.720 --> 15:23.090
because we want
the same stupid wedding date.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.924
And I know, Father,
I should be charitable

15:24.992 --> 15:26.559
and just let him have it.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.830
But...

15:30.897 --> 15:33.233
you know, it just comes back
to my heart issues,

15:33.300 --> 15:34.968
my -- my -- my --
my ticker.

15:35.035 --> 15:38.338
My cardiologist wants to try
the baboon heart.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.672
It's not gonna match.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.108
They never match.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.613
( Voice breaking )
I just want to
last long enough

15:46.679 --> 15:48.481
to see my little girl
get married.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.382
You know?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.151
**

15:54.954 --> 15:56.923
**

15:56.990 --> 15:57.924
( Sighs ) Hey.

15:57.991 --> 16:00.127
Hey!

16:00.193 --> 16:03.096
Introducing
Donna Gable's...

16:03.163 --> 16:07.700
( Italian accent )
authentic Italian lasagna!

16:07.767 --> 16:11.104
( Normal voice )
Heads-up -- I may have
lost an earring in that one.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.373
Yeah, we got to give, uh,
Terry Labasco the date.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.774
What?

16:14.841 --> 16:17.244
Trust me, it means a lot more
to him than it does to us.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.146
What happened?
( Exhales sharply )

16:19.212 --> 16:22.249
I learned some stuff today --
some personal stuff.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.717
He...has
a heart condition.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.587
Really? Are you sure?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.822
I'm sure. He was
in my confessional today.

16:31.758 --> 16:32.759
What?

16:32.825 --> 16:34.127
( Sighs )
He thought I was a priest.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.328
Look, if I walk you
through it,

16:35.395 --> 16:37.130
you'd realize
it's not a big deal.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.402
So...he's really sick?

16:42.469 --> 16:44.571
Yeah, he might not even
make it
to his daughter's wedding.

16:44.637 --> 16:45.772
Oh, man.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.739
Yeah.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.809
Oh, that's really sad.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.312
It makes you
think about stuff.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.381
And this was
a big, fat waste of time!

16:54.447 --> 16:56.383
What are we gonna do
with all this lasagna?

16:56.449 --> 16:58.618
I'll take care of it
for you.

17:01.254 --> 17:04.324
No. It's going
to the church.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.759
Absolutely. All right, I will
just load them in the car.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.061
Not a chance.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.229
Hey. Guys.

17:09.296 --> 17:12.432
Um, okay, so, we just wanted
to apologize.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.368
Yes. You were right,
Mr. Gable. We were being
very silly.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.669
Yeah, and we talked,

17:16.736 --> 17:19.272
and we realized just how much
we love each other.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.874
So we are good to go
on the 17th!

17:21.941 --> 17:24.344
Yeah, it's not gonna happen.
She'll fill you in
on the deets.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.280

17:32.552 --> 17:35.488
You're not gonna
usher your way
to that date, pal.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.824
Terry, you can have
the date, okay?

17:37.890 --> 17:38.858
What?

17:38.925 --> 17:40.327
I already talked
to Father Philip.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.429
It's yours.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.197
Wow.
Yeah,

so hap-- happy.

17:55.007 --> 17:55.875

18:01.548 --> 18:03.783
( Organ playing )

18:06.119 --> 18:07.854
Linda.
Hey.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.689
I wanted to let you know
that Kevin and I

18:09.756 --> 18:11.824

the date.

Also, I'm a nurse,
so if you need anything

18:18.931 --> 18:22.802
or you want any referrals,
please reach out to me, okay?

18:22.869 --> 18:24.271
What are you
talking about?

18:24.337 --> 18:26.473
( Clicks tongue )

18:26.539 --> 18:28.708
Terry's heart condition.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.446
Okay.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.348
Thank you.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.451
Oh, there you go.
Beautiful. Thank you.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.519
Thank you.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.890
You know my situation.

18:46.025 --> 18:48.428
Why would you do this
to me?

18:55.868 --> 18:58.505
He's lying. He doesn't have
a heart condition.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.407
He played you.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.508
He confessed.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.643
No, he knew it was you.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.312
I just talked
to his wife.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.516
I lit a candle for him!

19:15.388 --> 19:17.457
Hey, Labasco,
how you feeling?

19:17.524 --> 19:19.226
What are you
talking about?

19:19.292 --> 19:21.060
I know you're not dying.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.162
Oh, yeah?
Who said I was?

19:23.230 --> 19:25.898
"Father Kevin"?

19:25.965 --> 19:28.635
Well, you know what?
You can
kiss that date goodbye.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.603
Oh, no.
No. It's mine.

19:32.439 --> 19:33.973
Never.

19:34.040 --> 19:34.974
Mine.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.477
( Sighs deeply )

19:37.544 --> 19:39.646
( Dramatic music plays )

19:42.315 --> 19:44.451
( Both grunting )

19:44.517 --> 19:47.287
( Music stops )

19:47.354 --> 19:48.321
Father.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.928
( Music, grunting resume )

20:08.708 --> 20:10.042
**

20:10.109 --> 20:12.144
I was just trying to do
something nice
for my daughter,

20:12.211 --> 20:14.947
and...well,
it got away from me.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.583
Mm-hmm.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.151
Of course, you know about the
stick fight
outside the church.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.622
That's probably why neither
family is getting the 17th.

20:22.689 --> 20:23.656
Mm-hmm.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.392
Is that a done deal,
by the way?

20:27.294 --> 20:28.795
Yes.
Yeah.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.663
Is that all?

20:30.730 --> 20:31.464
Yes.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.265
All right.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.501
No.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.437
About an hour ago, I sat
in a handicapped parking spot

20:37.504 --> 20:38.905
and ate
an entire tray of lasagna

20:38.971 --> 20:41.874
that I promised my wife
I would give to the church.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.946
So...
there's nothing left?

20:47.013 --> 20:48.615
There may be a corner.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.285
There isn't.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.954

20:55.021 --> 20:58.325

no sweet perfume *

20:58.391 --> 21:01.928

go bust your move *

21:01.994 --> 21:04.130

21:04.196 --> 21:05.665

21:05.732 --> 21:09.268

21:09.336 --> 21:12.339

no high-heel shoes *

21:12.405 --> 21:14.974
* I just don't want no...
