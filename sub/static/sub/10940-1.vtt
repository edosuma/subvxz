the Heartland brand.

13:49.595 --> 13:52.621
A small investment
with very large returns.

13:52.731 --> 13:54.756
Dad totally agrees with me.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.802
Well, that makes it
just about perfect.

13:57.903 --> 13:59.268
And where are those dudes
gonna stay?

13:59.371 --> 14:01.896
We don't have any place for them.
Where are you going to put them?

14:03.642 --> 14:04.404
In cabins.

14:05.477 --> 14:07.172
And who's gonna pay for this?

14:07.279 --> 14:08.303
We got a loan.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.109
Who's we?

14:10.883 --> 14:12.077
Dad and I.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.515
Look, it'll pay for the buildings.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.746
Yeah? And where are you
gonna build your buildings?

14:15.855 --> 14:18.255
Grandpa, we have 600 acres.

14:18.357 --> 14:22.259
That's right. And last I checked,
they were my 600 acres!

14:31.904 --> 14:34.805
We need the extra money,
and it's a good way to make it.

14:34.907 --> 14:37.307
It's a funny way
of making money to me.

14:37.409 --> 14:40.640
Paying a whole pile of interest
to a bank for a loan.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.976
That's just the initial investment.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.414
Do you remember the fire?

14:45.584 --> 14:47.347
Do you remember how much
it would have cost us

14:47.453 --> 14:49.182
to repair the barn
if people hadrt helped us out?

14:49.288 --> 14:51.119
Well, It's none of my business,

14:51.223 --> 14:53.714
but I don't know anybody
that got rich runnir a dude ranch.

14:53.893 --> 14:58.853
Okay. Just so everyone is clear,
it is not a dude ranch.

14:58.964 --> 15:00.226
Whatever.

15:00.799 --> 15:03.029
I think the dude ranch
is a great idea.

15:03.135 --> 15:07.629
I could teach lessons.
Help out over the summer holidays.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.436
But that's still under consideration.
Right, Jack?

15:13.245 --> 15:15.236
I'll be back later.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.114
You haven't said much.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.714
I still think it's a good idea.

15:22.821 --> 15:24.516
Thank you, Mallory.

15:24.623 --> 15:27.387
So, Amy, what are you gonna do
for your birthday?

15:27.493 --> 15:29.859
If it were up to me,
I'd have a huge party with a DJ,

15:29.962 --> 15:32.157
but that's obviously
not gonna happen.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.754
My mom watches this show

15:33.899 --> 15:37.062
where girls have massively expensive
sweet 16 parties.

15:37.169 --> 15:38.500
They get everything they want,

15:38.604 --> 15:41.334
and they still end up hating
everybody for doing it for them.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.465
Have you seen the show?

15:45.144 --> 15:46.668
So, what are you gonna do?

15:46.912 --> 15:49.346
I don't know.
It's no big deal.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.506
I totally understand.

15:50.683 --> 15:53.208
I can't even think
how excruciating it'd be

15:53.319 --> 15:55.344
having a birthday without your...

15:55.454 --> 15:56.352
Ow!

15:58.691 --> 16:02.457
Okay. I'm gonna go
do my homework.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.494
So, what are you doing
for her birthday?

16:06.598 --> 16:08.225
Never you mind, Mallory.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.699
Are you having a surprise party?

16:09.802 --> 16:10.769
Mallory!

16:12.371 --> 16:13.360
How did you know?

16:13.539 --> 16:15.905
I promise not to tell.
But you gotta help me out, too.

16:16.075 --> 16:17.975
You have to convince Jack to let me
stay here for the summer.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.907
I could die at that camp.

16:20.012 --> 16:23.345
Malnutrition, West Nile,
multiple bee stings.

16:23.449 --> 16:27.215
My mom's allergic to bees.
It could be genetic.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.343
Is that a hint?

16:28.454 --> 16:30.445
Good-bye, Mallory.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.051
[Horn honking]

16:40.933 --> 16:44.130
Where do you get off making
all these plans behind my back?

16:44.303 --> 16:45.861
We werert deliberately
keeping it from you

16:45.971 --> 16:47.563
if that's got you all wound up.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.073
Lou didn't want to say anything until
we knew it was even possible to do.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.506
I'm just trying to help her
make it work.

16:51.610 --> 16:52.872
Oh, well, that's real big of you.

16:52.978 --> 16:56.038
These corporate retreat things
can be pretty lucrative, Jack.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.378
She's got an MBA, for God's sake.
Let her use it.

16:58.484 --> 17:01.510
Well, I would have appreciated it,
since it's on my land,

17:01.620 --> 17:03.349
if you guys came to me first
and not last.

17:03.455 --> 17:05.286
Okay, you got a point.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.655
We should have.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.025
Just try to get behind her on this.

17:11.730 --> 17:14.597
She's got something to prove.
That's not a bad thing.

17:14.700 --> 17:19.728
No, Tim. I think it's you
that's got something to prove.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.313
[Horse nickers]

17:33.419 --> 17:36.354
I can take care of that guy
if you're in a hurry to get to school.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.582
Thanks.
That would be great.

17:38.724 --> 17:43.252
Hey, you wanna hang out sometime?
Saturday night?

17:43.362 --> 17:46.923
Maybe catch a movie,
or, I don't know, do something?

17:47.032 --> 17:49.523
Um, that would be...

17:49.668 --> 17:51.192
Oh, my God! Come here!

17:51.303 --> 17:52.861
What?

17:54.706 --> 17:55.934
What are you looking at?

17:56.041 --> 17:58.134
I saw him again.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.210
You saw who?

17:59.311 --> 18:01.711
The ghost horse.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.611
The ghost horse.

18:04.049 --> 18:05.038
This Mustang.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.448
I saw him get driven away
from his herd the other day.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.316
And now I just keep seeing him.

18:09.488 --> 18:11.012
Okay.

18:11.123 --> 18:12.556
Shut up, I do.

18:12.658 --> 18:14.057
I saw him yesterday
on Plummers Road.

18:14.159 --> 18:16.525
He just keeps getting closer
and closer to Heartland.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.152
I know it sounds crazy,

18:18.263 --> 18:20.527
but it's almost like
he's looking for me or something.

18:20.632 --> 18:22.259
I'm sure he is.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.098
Look, there he is.

18:36.215 --> 18:39.742
We should really try to get him
in a pen or something.

18:40.352 --> 18:42.980
Look at those wounds.

18:43.722 --> 18:48.216
How do you figure that you're gonna
get anywhere near that horse?

18:48.794 --> 18:51.058
Thought you were
a prize-winning cowboy.

19:04.409 --> 19:05.967
Come on!

19:07.412 --> 19:09.277
Good boy.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.743
Come on!

19:18.157 --> 19:19.089
Yeah!

19:19.191 --> 19:20.055
[Amy laughs]

19:23.228 --> 19:26.356
You all right down there, cowboy?

19:38.377 --> 19:39.969
[Horse squeals]

19:47.286 --> 19:48.810
What a beauty.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.621
Sure is.

19:52.724 --> 19:55.557
So, what about Saturday night?

19:56.795 --> 19:58.990
Oh, my God! School.

19:59.398 --> 20:00.956
Bye!

20:04.970 --> 20:07.939
I'll definitely have a chat with her.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.237
Fine, Mrs... .
Miss Adams.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.277
I've got your number.
I sure do.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.245
You have a nice day now.

20:16.548 --> 20:21.417
So, we need to talk.
Like adults.

20:22.588 --> 20:24.215
And you need to talk to Dad.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.192
Already have.

20:27.426 --> 20:28.358
Oh.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.621
I thought partners were supposed
to tell each other everything.

20:31.763 --> 20:35.130
Look, I know you're still probably
100% against the idea...

20:35.234 --> 20:40.228
You know, Lou. I'm a man
who likes his privacy,

20:40.472 --> 20:43.134
and the thought of sitting
at this table making small talk

20:43.242 --> 20:45.472
with folks I don't know
or care to know

20:45.577 --> 20:46.771
does not sit too well with me.

20:46.878 --> 20:49.506
The dining in the house situation
would only be temporary.

20:49.615 --> 20:52.413
It's hard enough to get along
without some stranger's big ears

20:52.517 --> 20:54.610
flapping at every little
single thing you say.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.813
I know. I see your point, but...

20:58.457 --> 21:00.652
Look, can I show you something?

21:02.027 --> 21:05.861
Okay, so this is
your typical equine retreat.

21:05.964 --> 21:08.194
Not nearly as good as ours will be.

21:08.367 --> 21:14.203
And just look at these rates.
And that is per day.

21:14.306 --> 21:15.898
Unbelievable.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.306
Grandpa, people will pay top dollar
for an experience like this.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.934
Look, I have my MBA.

21:20.045 --> 21:20.977
So I've heard.

21:21.079 --> 21:22.410
I need to use my skills,

21:22.514 --> 21:24.880
or I'm gonna go nuts
and drive everyone around me crazy.

21:24.983 --> 21:27.474
I know that, too.
You already have.

21:27.653 --> 21:29.280
Just be on my team, Grandpa.

21:29.521 --> 21:32.149
Your team?
Is that equine retreat lingo?

21:32.257 --> 21:33.519
No!

21:33.625 --> 21:34.683
Maybe.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.227
Look, Lou, you got to remember,

21:37.329 --> 21:39.889
old dogs do not like
to learn new tricks.

21:39.998 --> 21:42.398
Just keep an open mind about it.

21:42.501 --> 21:43.763
I'll tell you one thing, though.

21:43.869 --> 21:44.858
Equine retreat or no,

21:44.970 --> 21:47.165
I'm not gonna be a full-time
baby-sitter all summer.

21:47.272 --> 21:49.331
Well, the jury is still out
on that one, too.

21:49.441 --> 21:50.999
I love Mallory.
She's a sweetheart.

21:51.109 --> 21:54.670
But she's just going to be underfoot
in the house.

22:00.419 --> 22:03.820
So, she totally freaked,
gave me all this extra homework,

22:03.922 --> 22:06.220
and it's the weekend,
and it's my birthday.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.793
Do you have any big plans?

22:08.894 --> 22:09.883
I might.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.587
What?

22:11.697 --> 22:12.686
A date.

22:12.798 --> 22:14.390
With who?

22:14.499 --> 22:15.830

Oh, yeah.

22:31.683 --> 22:35.141
Got a call from your teacher,
a Miss Adams.

22:35.253 --> 22:36.447
She called?

22:36.555 --> 22:39.820
Something about a study session
you never showed up for.

22:39.925 --> 22:41.654
I'm sorry.
I just totally forgot.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.354
I got involved with... something.

22:44.463 --> 22:46.897
That wouldn't be
the something, would it?

22:46.998 --> 22:49.831
Where the hell did he come from?

22:49.935 --> 22:51.766
He's the one the rancher's
almost shot.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.861
He just kind of followed me home.

22:54.773 --> 22:57.173
You don't think
you can keep him here, I hope.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.106
I'm gonna try.

23:02.347 --> 23:04.281
He's a wild horse, Amy.
Not easy to gentle.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.442
Wild horses are gentled all the time.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.610
There's even a penitentiary
in Colorado

23:08.720 --> 23:10.244
where the convicts work with them.

23:10.355 --> 23:12.255
It's like they learn from each other.
To trust.

23:12.357 --> 23:15.349
Too much trust
is not necessarily a good thing.

23:15.460 --> 23:16.950
Now, you take him even halfway,

23:17.062 --> 23:20.896
and he'll lose his abilities
to cope in the wild.

23:20.999 --> 23:23.968
Let me at least try.

23:24.970 --> 23:25.902
Fine.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.632
But don't let it interfere
with school, you got it?

23:30.609 --> 23:34.306

You don't care
about my training program,

23:52.364 --> 23:53.524
about my jump configurations.

23:53.632 --> 23:54.997
It looks like a pretzel.

23:55.167 --> 23:58.261
You are so annoying!
You never listen to me!

24:01.840 --> 24:04.900
I do. Okay?
I do listen to you.

I will listen.

25:00.966 --> 25:02.797
Mallory, what are you doing here?

25:04.302 --> 25:07.032
What are you doing here?

25:07.138 --> 25:09.368
I heard you.

25:10.075 --> 25:11.406
Why are you up here?

25:11.510 --> 25:13.876
Lou thinks I'll get in the way
if I stay here all summer.

25:13.979 --> 25:16.038
So, I was thinking
of sleeping up here,

25:16.147 --> 25:17.808
so I don't bother her at all.

25:18.984 --> 25:20.747
The mattress isn't that bad.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.786
I could definitely make the place
a little more girly,

25:22.888 --> 25:24.287

25:28.326 --> 25:31.318
I mean, is he coming back?

25:31.429 --> 25:32.487
I hope he does.

25:32.597 --> 25:35.031
Ty chose to leave, Mallory.

25:35.133 --> 25:37.966
Besides, it's gonna be really hot
here in the summer,

25:38.069 --> 25:39.798

at dealing with bats?

25:41.673 --> 25:43.800
Bats?

25:43.909 --> 25:45.376
Amy, wait!

25:46.211 --> 25:48.406
You know what I like best
about you?

25:48.513 --> 25:49.571
No.

The way that you absolutely
embrace change

25:53.084 --> 25:56.952

and adventurous attitude.

over the last year.

26:00.258 --> 26:02.453
I know. You're right.
It hasn't been easy.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.292
But you've asked my advice,
and I'm going to give it to you.
