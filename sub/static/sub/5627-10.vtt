WEBVTT

00:14.380 --> 00:18.380
Okay, this sounded like a lot
more fun after three margaritas.

00:18.380 --> 00:20.380
You were the one craving frog's legs.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.420
Yeah, in a restaurant with an AC

00:22.420 --> 00:25.210
and a nice little
arugula salad on the side.

00:25.670 --> 00:27.210
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

00:27.210 --> 00:30.580
Of course. My dad must have taken me
frog gigging a thousand times.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.580
And, that, ladies and gentlemen,

00:38.580 --> 00:40.290
is how it's done.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.620
Gross.

00:41.620 --> 00:43.040
No, it's not.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.830
Where do you think
your food comes from?

00:45.830 --> 00:47.420
The supermarket.

00:47.420 --> 00:49.040
Give me the flashlight.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.710
It's your turn.

00:50.710 --> 00:52.380
Go on.

00:52.710 --> 00:54.830
Hold it up like that. There you go.

01:14.380 --> 01:15.580
Oh!

01:17.040 --> 01:18.330
I got it.

01:18.330 --> 01:19.750
All right. That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:19.750 --> 01:21.620
Wow, that was actually kind of fun.

01:21.620 --> 01:24.000
Must be stuck.

01:25.710 --> 01:26.750
Oh!

01:38.540 --> 01:39.920
I'm in.

01:41.500 --> 01:42.920
Well, I think you're bluffing.

01:42.920 --> 01:46.880
So I will see your fuzzy pencil...

01:47.540 --> 01:49.330
And raise you,

01:49.710 --> 01:51.750
from the Dominican Republic,

01:51.750 --> 01:55.210
one Fuente Fuente Opus X.

01:55.210 --> 01:56.580
I don't understand why we're betting.

01:56.580 --> 01:58.080
I don't smoke.

01:58.080 --> 02:02.000
Because poker is not fun unless
you have something on the line.

02:02.420 --> 02:04.210
Fine. Give me three cards.

02:04.580 --> 02:05.830
Yeah, I'm good.

02:10.540 --> 02:13.080
What

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
You have heard the expression
"a poker face" before?

02:24.960 --> 02:28.960
This will not go on forever, Penelope.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.710
It feels like it will.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.330
I'm scared.

02:32.330 --> 02:34.250
There are people out there
that want to hurt me.

02:34.250 --> 02:35.880
I'm scared I'm gonna be stuck in here

02:35.880 --> 02:37.540
because there's people out there
that wanna hurt me.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.790
It's Hotch. We have a case.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.120
Listen...

02:46.120 --> 02:48.580
We're gonna take these guys down.

02:48.580 --> 02:50.670
In the meantime,

02:50.670 --> 02:53.170
you just have to stay strong.

02:53.620 --> 02:56.420
St. Augustine, Florida,
two bodies were found

02:56.420 --> 02:58.170
early this evening
in a remote wooded area

02:58.170 --> 03:00.540
just west of the city.
Neither have been identified yet.

03:00.540 --> 03:01.880
This woman's complexion...

03:01.880 --> 03:03.210
She was exsanguinated,

03:03.210 --> 03:04.960
which is a really fun word to say,

03:04.960 --> 03:06.750
but I didn't know its terrible meaning

03:06.750 --> 03:08.250
until I started working here.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.080
Odd that only the female
had her blood removed.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.040
Well, the male victim
might have been collateral damage,

03:12.040 --> 03:14.250
or a witness that needed to be silenced.

03:14.250 --> 03:15.460
I mean,
it is the kind of message

03:15.460 --> 03:17.040
that rival drug gangs
would send to each other.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.540
The Curiel syndicate recently
set up shop in Florida.

03:19.540 --> 03:21.290
Except it looks like
these two were meant

03:21.290 --> 03:23.170
to vanish without anyone the wiser.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.670
How is that a message?

03:24.670 --> 03:26.080
Well, cartels have also been known

03:26.080 --> 03:27.580
to use murder as a form of voodoo.

03:27.580 --> 03:29.830
In 1989, a University of Texas student

03:29.830 --> 03:32.500
was murdered by a satanic gang
while on spring break.

03:32.500 --> 03:35.120
Well, my gut says
it has nothing to do with drugs.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.750
More like straight-out vampirism
or someone with a blood fetish.

03:38.290 --> 03:40.790
It's late and we need to hit the
ground running. Wheels up in 30.

04:21.880 --> 04:22.920
Hello?

04:33.290 --> 04:34.790
Are you ready?

04:36.750 --> 04:38.040
Yes.

04:40.210 --> 04:42.000
Wait. What's that?

04:42.960 --> 04:44.710
Don't you trust me?

04:44.710 --> 04:48.620
Uh... You never said anything
about a blindfold.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.210
It's required.

04:52.170 --> 04:53.710
You know what? Uh...

04:54.460 --> 04:56.830
This is kind of freaking me out.

04:58.790 --> 05:00.620
I changed my mind.

05:46.460 --> 05:48.250
"The clock talked loud.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.170
"I threw it away.

05:50.170 --> 05:51.670
"It scared me when it talked."

05:52.250 --> 05:53.580
Tillie Olsen.

05:54.170 --> 05:57.500
The coroner attributes the lacerations
on the bodies to animal bites.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.540
Apparently there's a lot of
raccoons in the area.

05:59.540 --> 06:02.750
Maybe so, but the media's going all-in
with satanic mutilation.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.920
It's happened before.
The West Memphis Three case

06:04.920 --> 06:06.330
showed how animal activity on a corpse

06:06.330 --> 06:08.170
can be mistaken for ritualized torture.

06:08.170 --> 06:10.460
After the first bite,
the insect infestation

06:10.460 --> 06:12.380
expands and distorts the open wound.

06:12.380 --> 06:14.080
Okay, here's my finger,
here's the mute button.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.380
Are you guys done talking
about the critter damage?

06:16.380 --> 06:18.170
You can put your finger down, baby girl.
We're done.

06:18.170 --> 06:21.500
Thank you. And JJ's right,
local news and radio outlets

06:21.500 --> 06:25.750
are going wild with this being
a blood-worshipping cult murder.

06:26.830 --> 06:29.830
Hey, new information. Both of those
bodies have just been identified.

06:29.830 --> 06:31.500
Cheyenne Pravato, 23,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.540
and George Henning, 71.

06:34.540 --> 06:35.750
Any connection?

06:35.750 --> 06:37.080
My level one search
says no.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.880
My level two through 20 await.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.250
Cheyenne was a waitress
that is currently unemployed.

06:42.250 --> 06:44.710
Henning was a retired
steelworker from Pennsylvania.

06:45.210 --> 06:47.080
Lived in Florida a few years.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.830
They both went missing
three days ago.

06:48.830 --> 06:51.710
Three days?
The coroner estimated the time of death

06:51.710 --> 06:53.580
as less than 24 hours
from the time of discovery.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.620
Means the UnSub had the vics
for two full days before killing them.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.170
Preliminary indicators
show no sign of torture

07:00.170 --> 07:02.460
or sexual assault.
What was he doing with them?

07:02.460 --> 07:04.000
Dave, you find out
what you can about Cheyenne

07:04.000 --> 07:06.500
from friends and family.
Morgan, you do the same for Henning.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.420
Lewis, you go to the M.E., and JJ,
I need you to rein in the media.

07:09.420 --> 07:11.170
Hysteria's growing
and we need to contain it.

07:13.670 --> 07:16.620
ST. AUGUSTINE, FLORIDA

07:20.380 --> 07:21.830
Thanks for coming so quickly.

07:21.830 --> 07:23.000
Of course.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.040
It's crazy.
People are talking about devil worship,

07:27.040 --> 07:28.330
human sacrifice.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.790
Thought this might be a good place
for you and your team to work?

07:31.790 --> 07:33.290
It's great. Thank you.

07:33.290 --> 07:35.080
We need to debrief the press
as soon as possible.

07:35.380 --> 07:37.210
You don't mind doing
double duty on this, do you?

07:37.210 --> 07:38.880
I'm looking forward to it, actually.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.670
Dust off the old media liaison skills.

07:40.670 --> 07:42.290
Yeah, it's important. Publicity like this

07:42.290 --> 07:45.040
could encourage the UnSub
or inspire a copycat.

07:45.620 --> 07:47.880
Still waiting on the full
tox screen from the male victim.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.670
We think they may have been
held for up to two days. Were they fed?

07:50.670 --> 07:52.330
Stomach contents were empty,

07:52.330 --> 07:54.170
but nutrition and hydration
levels were normal.

07:54.170 --> 07:56.670
My guess is they were both fed
through an IV.

07:56.670 --> 07:58.460
I did find one curiosity.

07:58.460 --> 07:59.830
It looks like another animal bite.

07:59.830 --> 08:01.330
Not under magnification.

08:01.330 --> 08:03.500
It's actually
a surgically precise triangle.

08:06.540 --> 08:07.880
Dr. Gaylen.

08:10.460 --> 08:11.830
You're positive of that?

08:13.290 --> 08:16.420
The tox screen and DNA tests
on George Henning just came back.

08:16.420 --> 08:17.790
Are you ready for this?

08:17.790 --> 08:20.620
Most of the blood in his body isn't his.

08:20.620 --> 08:21.920
It's Cheyenne's.

08:24.210 --> 08:27.250
Agent Hotchner.
A missing persons report just came in

08:27.250 --> 08:29.330
that I think might be
connected to the case.

08:29.330 --> 08:31.920
Andrea Gambrell. Her car was found

08:31.920 --> 08:34.670
abandoned at a cemetery
up near Jacksonville this morning.

08:34.670 --> 08:35.920
What makes you think it's related?

08:35.920 --> 08:38.670
Andrea and Cheyenne
waitressed at the same restaurant.

08:38.670 --> 08:40.880
Roommate said Andrea
was meeting some new guy.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.960
It involved something mysterious.

08:54.420 --> 08:56.420
Where... Where am I?

09:08.880 --> 09:10.330
Please...

09:14.250 --> 09:16.290
The blood drained from Cheyenne was
put into George Henning?

09:16.290 --> 09:17.960
I agree that that is strange.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.710
And a triangle was cut
from his calf muscle.

09:20.710 --> 09:23.290
Dear Diary, just when I thought
I'd heard it all...

09:23.290 --> 09:25.620
And there's still something
in the toxicology screen

09:25.620 --> 09:26.960
the M.E. can't identify.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.420
Yeah. We're hoping
we're gonna find out

09:28.420 --> 09:30.040
something more in the next few hours.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.500
So, it took a little arm-wrestling,

09:31.500 --> 09:32.790
but the media finally saw the wisdom

09:32.790 --> 09:35.000
in toning down
the whole demon worship angle.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.290
Don't take a victory lap just yet.

09:38.580 --> 09:39.750
You're kidding.

09:39.750 --> 09:42.290
I'm just trying to work out
this whole calf muscle business.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.750
Triangles are big in
Illuminati symbolism.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.620
This is bending back
toward cult behavior.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.330
What did you find out
about George Henning?

09:48.330 --> 09:49.960
According to the neighbors,
the guy was a shut-in.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.420
No friends or family,
a lot of health problems.

09:52.420 --> 09:53.920
Hypertension, Parkinson's.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.000
Cheyenne was the opposite.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.250
Vegan, into New Age lifestyles.

09:58.580 --> 10:02.580
Never met a harmonic convergence
she didn't want to converge on.

10:02.580 --> 10:04.210
I get it with him, he was a recluse,

10:04.210 --> 10:06.830
but how did nobody notice her missing
for three days?

10:06.830 --> 10:09.170
Her friends said that
Cheyenne was flighty.

10:09.170 --> 10:12.580
It was not unusual for her to
take off without notice for a week or two.

10:12.580 --> 10:14.000
This UnSub did
his homework.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.170
He knew that both victims could go
missing without any alarms going off.

10:17.170 --> 10:19.750
Transfusions and
sustained IV feeding take

10:19.750 --> 10:22.170
skill, planning, and access to materials.

10:22.170 --> 10:23.580
And crude as it was,

10:23.580 --> 10:25.830
the replacing of
the old blood with new is dialysis.

10:26.210 --> 10:30.380
What if the triangle isn't a symbol
but a tissue sample?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.330
Could this be medical experimentation?

10:32.330 --> 10:35.960
Yeah, I mean, you've got a
youthful, healthy host in Cheyenne

10:35.960 --> 10:37.540
and a sick test subject in Henning.

10:37.830 --> 10:39.920
If the new missing girl's his next victim,

10:39.920 --> 10:41.500
the UnSub could be getting
ready to try again.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.620
And this experiment takes two to tango.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.540
If Andrea mirrors Cheyenne,

10:45.920 --> 10:47.620
then who mirrors George?

10:54.420 --> 10:57.250
Please, don't do this.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.920
I have to go to work now,

10:59.210 --> 11:00.880
but I'll be back this evening.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.250
What...

11:02.250 --> 11:04.710
Don't worry.
I promise I'm not gonna hurt you.

11:21.790 --> 11:23.080
How you feeling, sweetheart?

11:23.710 --> 11:25.080
I'm okay.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.170
It's a long drive,

11:27.460 --> 11:29.500
but I feel good about this time.

11:30.460 --> 11:32.080
I miss home.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.290
So do I.

11:33.670 --> 11:35.420
But this could be our answer.

11:35.420 --> 11:36.880
They do cutting-edge stuff here.

11:37.210 --> 11:39.540
All those tests. I don't know, Ben.

11:40.170 --> 11:43.290
Maybe it's better just to accept things

11:43.290 --> 11:44.460
as they are.

11:44.460 --> 11:48.080
Don't talk like that.
A positive attitude is half the battle.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.210
Mr. and Mrs. Kebler.

11:49.210 --> 11:50.420
Yes.

11:50.420 --> 11:52.290
The lab results are back
from Eileen's tests.

11:52.290 --> 11:53.670
Let's go into my office and talk.

11:59.420 --> 12:00.620
Sir, yes, sir.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.790
Garcia, I need you to do a search

12:01.790 --> 12:03.920
of doctors and medical
professionals in the region

12:03.920 --> 12:05.170
and see what kind of red flags pop up.

12:05.170 --> 12:08.000
But of course. Carmine, scarlet, cherry,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.210
crimson, maroon

12:10.210 --> 12:12.460
Ethics violations, improper protocol.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.250
This person may have
washed out of medical school

12:14.250 --> 12:15.920
or gotten in trouble
with the licensing board

12:15.920 --> 12:17.250
for unorthodox practices.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.330
That's a deep shade.
Hit you back when I have something.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.580
I'm sorry.

12:25.170 --> 12:28.330
There are drugs that can
minimize the symptoms.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.170
How long does she have?

12:32.500 --> 12:34.830
Mr. Kebler, I would rather
talk about how we can

12:34.830 --> 12:37.250
-begin a strategy to help...
-How long?

12:38.290 --> 12:40.540
My wife and I want to know the truth.

12:43.210 --> 12:44.540
Six months.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.710
Maybe a little more.

12:51.790 --> 12:54.670
Ben, it's all right.

13:02.040 --> 13:07.290
I had a carpet store
back home, Dr. Braga.

13:08.120 --> 13:12.380
My wife taught middle school
for 35 years.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.960
We scrimped and we saved
our whole lives

13:16.960 --> 13:19.710
because we knew this time was coming.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.960
Retirement.

13:23.040 --> 13:27.460
The freedom to do all those things
we love to do, together.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.580
It's not fair.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.250
No, it's not.

13:33.420 --> 13:35.920
I'd like to start her with this,

13:35.920 --> 13:38.170
and I'd like to see Eileen
tomorrow morning

13:39.080 --> 13:41.830
to talk about a treatment strategy.

13:44.170 --> 13:45.880
Duloxetine. What's that?

13:45.880 --> 13:46.960
An anti-depressant.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.710
We drove 12 hours
to come to this office.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.420
We even rented an apartment in town.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.380
According to your website,
there are treatments at this hospital

13:59.380 --> 14:00.790
you can't get anywhere else.

14:00.790 --> 14:02.040
Clinical trials.

14:02.290 --> 14:04.710
Not for what Eileen is suffering from.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.710
It's important that you and your wife

14:07.710 --> 14:10.540
cherish the time
you do have left together.

14:10.540 --> 14:12.500
Each and every day is precious.

14:15.710 --> 14:19.710
00 tomorrow,

14:19.710 --> 14:21.380
if that works for you.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.210
What have you got, Garcia?

14:35.210 --> 14:37.330
Nothing on my crimson flag
doctor search,

14:37.330 --> 14:41.080
but I did learn about something
with a super cool name.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.880
The Mad Scientist club.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.000
And what's that?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.380
They're a student group

14:45.380 --> 14:47.500
from the Florida College of Medicine
in Jacksonville.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.120
Before they disbanded,
they used to get together

14:49.120 --> 14:51.710
and talk about experimental
ways to cure disease.

14:51.710 --> 14:52.960
Do you have the names
of the people in the club?

14:53.540 --> 14:55.120
Uh, kinda, sorta, not really.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.500
They were totally informal.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.540
Here's the part
that made me sit up straight.

14:58.540 --> 15:00.040
They used to meet at a local cemetery.

15:00.710 --> 15:03.960
Let me guess. The same cemetery
where Andrea Gambrell disappeared.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.120
Yeah, the very one.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.460
All right, keep working on the names

15:06.460 --> 15:08.580
and see if you can find out why the club
was disbanded.

15:08.580 --> 15:10.080
Okay.

15:13.460 --> 15:14.790
Agent Lewis.

15:14.790 --> 15:18.210
Yes, Agent. I've got the full tox screen
on George Henning.

15:18.210 --> 15:21.040
There were massive levels of
Levodopa in his system.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.210
The Parkinson's drug?

15:22.210 --> 15:23.330
Correct.

15:23.330 --> 15:25.540
Okay, but his blood
was replaced with Cheyenne's,

15:25.540 --> 15:27.790
so does that mean the Levodopa
was introduced into his system

15:27.790 --> 15:29.000
after the transfusion?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.710
Yes, ma'am. And we got the results

15:30.710 --> 15:33.620
of the other DNA samples
and the surprises keep coming.

15:33.960 --> 15:37.460
Found traces of mesoglea
and testudinata keratin.

15:37.710 --> 15:39.040
Which is?

15:39.040 --> 15:41.040
Jellyfish and turtle.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.960
George Henning had
animal DNA in his system.

15:52.210 --> 15:54.620
If only you could talk,

15:55.330 --> 15:58.460
what secrets you could tell.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.830
No!

16:03.330 --> 16:04.670
Stop!

16:05.460 --> 16:06.500
Don't die.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.830
Breathe.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.420
Breathe!

16:12.290 --> 16:13.750
Breathe!

16:15.620 --> 16:17.620
Breathe! Breathe!

16:18.880 --> 16:20.380
Breathe!

16:20.380 --> 16:21.790
Breathe!

16:21.790 --> 16:23.330
Breathe!

16:27.620 --> 16:29.580
No!

16:30.290 --> 16:31.460
No!

16:31.460 --> 16:32.880
No!

16:33.120 --> 16:34.330
No!

16:34.330 --> 16:35.920
No! No!

16:35.920 --> 16:37.710
No! No!

16:41.920 --> 16:44.920
Garcia's tracking recent aquarium
and exotic fish sales in the area.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.040
Aquarium sales in Florida.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.460
That's like tracking snow shovel sales
in Alaska.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.920
But jellyfish have unique
dietary and habitat needs,

16:51.920 --> 16:53.330
so hopefully that'll
narrow it down a little.

16:53.330 --> 16:54.750
A body's just been found.

16:54.750 --> 16:57.170
Officer on the scene thinks
it might be the work of our guy.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.420
Thanks.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.290
All right, so a homeless man found him.

17:09.290 --> 17:11.040
ID'd as Harold McDermott.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.040
Long-time local resident.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.830
No attempt to
hide the body this time, either.

17:16.210 --> 17:18.250
Our UnSub might be unraveling.

17:20.120 --> 17:22.380
Must have been
the new George Henning.

17:22.380 --> 17:27.420
Hate to think what's
swimming around in his bloodstream.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.330
Well, no obvious tissue removal.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.120
Bruising on his face and chest.

17:33.710 --> 17:34.880
Ah.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.120
Thought I might find something
like this in here.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.330
Medical ID card.

17:39.880 --> 17:43.670
Our victim suffered from epilepsy
and corticobasal degeneration.

17:43.960 --> 17:46.000
We'd better deliver the profile.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.580
We believe we're looking for
a male between the ages of 25 and 35.

17:49.580 --> 17:51.120
He may have had
some medical training,

17:51.120 --> 17:54.620
and he's able to obtain large quantities
of controlled pharmaceuticals.

17:54.620 --> 17:57.330
This guy's working off
the legal and ethical grid,

17:57.330 --> 17:59.580
doing highly dangerous
medical experimentation.

17:59.960 --> 18:03.580
We believe he's searching for a cure
for degenerative neurological diseases,

18:03.580 --> 18:05.080
but we don't know why.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.420
It could be personal.

18:06.420 --> 18:09.250
Either he or a loved one
suffers from a disease

18:09.250 --> 18:11.330
and it's a way to leapfrog
conventional research

18:11.330 --> 18:12.960
in an attempt to find a cure.

18:13.790 --> 18:15.710
Or it might not be
personal at all.

18:16.250 --> 18:17.880
This could be the UnSub playing God,

18:17.880 --> 18:20.540
assuming the role of savior and
rescuer of those in need.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.960
Another motive is old-fashioned greed.

18:23.250 --> 18:26.620
Financial rewards for medical
breakthroughs are substantial.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.920
Whatever the case,
two divergent methodologies

18:28.920 --> 18:30.460
are at work in this UnSub.

18:30.460 --> 18:33.000
On the one hand, he does show signs
of logic and reason.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.540
The scientific method of trial and error.

18:35.540 --> 18:38.380
On the other hand,
this person injected animal DNA

18:38.380 --> 18:39.880
into George Henning's body,

18:39.880 --> 18:42.540
revealing an irrational,
almost fantastical approach

18:42.540 --> 18:43.960
to achieving these medical goals.

18:44.330 --> 18:47.080
And this dichotomy may be evident
in his everyday life.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.120
He might appear charming
and trustworthy,

18:49.120 --> 18:52.170
which allows him to abduct his victims
with little or no difficulty.

18:52.170 --> 18:54.710
But the other half of his
Jekyll-and-Hyde personality

18:54.710 --> 18:56.920
would clash with authority figures.

18:56.920 --> 18:58.460
We believe that he had a conflict

18:58.460 --> 19:00.620
with the medical establishment
in the past.

19:00.620 --> 19:03.250
We have reason to believe that the
most recent victim, Andrea Gambrell,

19:03.250 --> 19:04.460
is still alive.

19:04.790 --> 19:06.670
The younger person is needed alive

19:06.670 --> 19:08.170
to provide healthy blood.

19:08.170 --> 19:10.790
But a new sick subject
to receive that blood

19:10.790 --> 19:12.420
will almost certainly be sought out.

19:12.420 --> 19:14.670
Postmortem violence found
on the most recent victim

19:14.670 --> 19:17.290
is a strong indicator that the killer
is losing control.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.080
This increased volatility
is cause for concern.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.580
If there are two voices in his head,

19:23.580 --> 19:24.920
the violent one is taking over.

19:45.710 --> 19:47.080
Listen to this one.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.710
Six days and seven nights cruising
the fjords of Norway.

19:51.380 --> 19:53.080
Sounds like fun.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.920
What we do is fly into Oslo,

19:54.920 --> 19:56.500
cruise up and down the coast,

19:56.500 --> 19:58.460
and it says if we go in winter,

19:58.460 --> 20:00.750
there's a good chance of seeing
the Northern Lights.

20:00.750 --> 20:03.580
You've always wanted to see
the Northern Lights.

20:03.580 --> 20:05.500
I'm sorry.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.750
For what?

20:06.750 --> 20:08.210
Letting you down.

20:08.210 --> 20:10.670
We were gonna do so many things,
and then I got sick.

20:10.670 --> 20:12.710
No, no, no. Don't say that.

20:12.710 --> 20:14.500
Listen to me, Ben.

20:14.500 --> 20:17.000
When I'm gone, I want you
to continue on.

20:17.580 --> 20:18.750
Eileen...

20:18.750 --> 20:20.170
No, I mean it.

20:20.170 --> 20:23.250
I want you to live the life
that we talked about.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.120
I'll be there with you.

20:30.210 --> 20:32.330
You are going to get better,

20:32.330 --> 20:36.250
and we are going to see
the Northern Lights. Together.

20:38.580 --> 20:40.420
I should sleep now.

20:40.420 --> 20:42.040
Of course, sweetheart.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.500
I'm sorry. You get your rest.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.120
Who is it?

21:24.120 --> 21:26.080
Mr. Kebler, my name is Robert Boles.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.420
I'm from the hospital.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.460
Can we talk?

21:36.170 --> 21:38.290
I have something
that could save your wife.

21:43.170 --> 21:45.290
Garcia was able to locate
one of the former members

21:45.290 --> 21:49.000
of this Mad Scientist Club, Diane Haller.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.540
She's coming in to talk to Lewis.

21:50.540 --> 21:53.040
The M.E. found more animal DNA
in George Henning's body.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.250
Sea urchin and some type
of tropical parrot.

21:55.250 --> 21:56.880
What the hell's next,

21:56.880 --> 21:58.460
emulsified auto parts?

21:58.460 --> 22:00.380
Unless the UnSub's having
a complete psychotic break,

22:00.380 --> 22:02.500
these transfusions have
to make some sense medically.

22:02.500 --> 22:05.120
I've done some Dr. Reid research
since he's on leave.

22:05.120 --> 22:08.710
Jellyfish have been used to treat
cardiovascular disease

22:08.710 --> 22:10.790
but not something like Parkinson's.

22:10.790 --> 22:13.000
Well, maybe the UnSub's
looking beyond neurology.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.790
He's trying to cure
a wider range of diseases.

22:15.830 --> 22:18.330
These creatures he's using,
they're exotic.

22:18.330 --> 22:20.670
Hard to acquire, difficult to maintain.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.000
There are a number
of private zoos in the region.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.290
I'll have Garcia look into it.

22:25.330 --> 22:27.580
Why should I trust you?
You're not even a doctor.

22:28.040 --> 22:30.460
A doctor can't offer you
what I'm offering.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.210
Because it's not legal, right?

22:37.620 --> 22:40.420
If your wife is cured,
do you care if you broke a few rules?

22:45.580 --> 22:48.120
This treatment you're talking about,

22:48.120 --> 22:49.620
what does it involve?

22:49.620 --> 22:51.500
-Transfusions.
-Of what?

22:52.380 --> 22:54.420
A formula that I've been working on.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.380
Oh, this sounds too risky.

22:58.380 --> 23:00.380
Mr. Kebler, if you do nothing,

23:01.210 --> 23:02.620
your wife will die.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.920
What are you risking?

23:11.710 --> 23:13.960
If I agreed,

23:13.960 --> 23:15.290
when would it start?

23:15.710 --> 23:17.670
Right now.

23:18.120 --> 23:20.080
I have everything I need in my vehicle.

23:23.580 --> 23:27.380
So, the Mad Scientist Club.
It sounds interesting.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.620
Yeah, it was fun.

23:29.620 --> 23:31.040
What did you guys talk about?

23:31.710 --> 23:34.250
Advancements in
medical research mostly.

23:34.620 --> 23:36.710
Stem cell, chromatin looping.

23:37.080 --> 23:40.460
Honestly, it was more of a drinking club
after the first hour.

23:41.750 --> 23:44.080
I'm curious, why the cemetery?

23:44.080 --> 23:45.670
It made it spookier.

23:45.670 --> 23:48.670
We were talking about all this
out there kind of stuff, you know?

23:49.580 --> 23:52.830
Was there anyone in the group
who made you feel uncomfortable?

23:52.830 --> 23:54.790
Someone who gave off an odd vibe?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.710
There was this one guy.

23:57.710 --> 23:59.420
He only came a couple times,

23:59.420 --> 24:01.460
-but he gave everyone the creeps.
-How so?

24:01.460 --> 24:04.620
He started going off about how
we were in a magical place

24:04.920 --> 24:09.830
and none of us realized because
only he was from around here.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.960
We called him the "Magic Man."

24:14.750 --> 24:15.960
Do you remember his actual name?

24:16.380 --> 24:18.460
Richard or Robert, maybe.

24:18.460 --> 24:19.710
How about a last name?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.380
No. Sorry.

24:21.380 --> 24:24.120
What do you think he meant
by "magical place"?

24:24.120 --> 24:25.500
I have no idea.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.920
Like I said, he only came
a few times and that was it.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.380
No one ever saw him again.

24:32.460 --> 24:34.790
All done, ma'am.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.830
You should try and get some rest.

24:38.830 --> 24:40.790
Thank you so much.

24:41.540 --> 24:45.040
I'll check back in later
to see how you're doing.

24:53.830 --> 24:56.670
Your wife will need another transfusion
in three days.

24:56.670 --> 24:57.960
When will we see results?

24:59.040 --> 25:01.290
There are a lot of unknowns,

25:01.290 --> 25:03.790
but it could be soon.

25:04.380 --> 25:05.960
Very soon.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.080
Is he gone?

25:20.580 --> 25:22.290
Yes. How are you feeling?

25:22.290 --> 25:23.710
Tired.

25:24.170 --> 25:28.460
I wonder, why didn't
Dr. Braga tell us about this

25:28.460 --> 25:30.170
when we were in her office?

25:30.170 --> 25:33.420
Well, she's a busy woman.

25:33.420 --> 25:35.750
It must have slipped her mind.

25:35.750 --> 25:36.790
Oh.

25:37.170 --> 25:39.420
Garcia, look, I need you to
check something out for me.

25:39.420 --> 25:40.830
It is not much to run with, but...

25:40.830 --> 25:43.120
Mmm, I will be the judge of that.
Gimme, gimme.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.500
All right, we're looking for a student,

25:44.500 --> 25:46.250
first name Richard or Robert,
no last name,

25:46.540 --> 25:49.000
who attended the Florida
College of Medicine in Jacksonville

25:49.000 --> 25:51.120
at the time that the Mad Scientist Club
was active.

25:51.420 --> 25:53.880
Richard or Robert and no last name.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.880
So my judgment is that Bartholomew

25:56.880 --> 26:00.040
or Oglethorpe with no last name
would be easier?

26:00.040 --> 26:02.000
Well, his interest may have been
in neuroscience,

26:02.000 --> 26:03.380
and he claims he was from the area.

26:03.380 --> 26:04.960
That helps, milady. My love to you,

26:04.960 --> 26:07.790
my sneakers are on,
I'm running with this.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.710
Honey, is everything okay?

26:14.170 --> 26:15.790
The strangest thing.

26:16.670 --> 26:18.080
I feel much better.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.000
You do?

26:20.290 --> 26:23.290
That medicine
that Dr. Braga prescribed,

26:23.620 --> 26:25.080
I think it's working.

26:25.330 --> 26:27.290
-I can't believe it.
-

26:27.290 --> 26:29.830
Maybe we could take a short walk,

26:29.830 --> 26:31.040
just to the corner.

26:31.580 --> 26:34.750
I haven't felt the air on my face
for so long.

26:37.540 --> 26:39.380
Mmm.

26:55.540 --> 26:56.880
What's going on?

26:59.710 --> 27:01.040
I'm calling security.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.420
Doctor Pierel to Radiology,

27:08.420 --> 27:10.710
Doctor Pierel to Radiology.

27:23.210 --> 27:24.330
How are you feeling?

27:25.040 --> 27:26.120
Happy.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.460
It's a miracle.

27:28.460 --> 27:30.460
Well, I'm not cured yet,

27:30.460 --> 27:34.790
but this is the closest I've felt
to my old self in months.

27:35.380 --> 27:37.620
Well, I'm never letting you go.

27:37.620 --> 27:39.380
I love you, Ben.

28:42.380 --> 28:43.960
Dr. Laura Braga,

28:43.960 --> 28:46.750
00 last night.

28:46.750 --> 28:50.080
She was heading back to the office
to grab some files she'd forgotten.

28:50.080 --> 28:52.080
Guessing the blood is hers.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.750
I wonder how he got her out of here

28:57.000 --> 28:58.330
with no one noticing.

28:58.330 --> 28:59.580
She's a neurologist.

29:00.120 --> 29:01.750
There's the connection.

29:02.210 --> 29:05.830
The UnSub could have gotten
extra Levodopa from here.

29:05.830 --> 29:07.460
Better check to see
if she was George Henning's

29:07.460 --> 29:09.290
or Harold McDermott's physician.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.000
And we should also check
her current patients.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.040
If this is where the UnSub
is getting his victims,

29:13.040 --> 29:14.380
one of them could be next.

29:41.460 --> 29:44.790
Well, Garcia compiled a list
of every medical student

29:44.790 --> 29:47.540
in the north Florida area with
the first name of Richard or Robert,

29:47.540 --> 29:49.710
and I gotta tell you guys,
it is a long list.

29:49.710 --> 29:51.920
So which one is our Magic Man?

29:55.380 --> 29:56.960
What's up, Rossi?

29:56.960 --> 29:59.120
They identified the bird DNA in Henning

29:59.120 --> 30:01.170
as coming from a scarlet macaw.

30:01.750 --> 30:03.420
Mmm-hmm. And?

30:03.420 --> 30:07.330
Well, it got me thinking
about Turritopsis dohrnii.

30:07.330 --> 30:09.040
Turri... What?

30:09.380 --> 30:11.210
It's called the immortal jellyfish.

30:11.670 --> 30:13.830
Uh, endlessly recycles its own cells

30:13.830 --> 30:15.920
through a process
called transdifferentiation,

30:15.920 --> 30:18.170
a kind of lineage reprogramming.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.040
Oh, my goodness.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.670
Dr. Spencer Reid, master of disguise.

30:22.670 --> 30:24.710
No disguise. I called a kid last night.

30:25.790 --> 30:27.420
But think about it.

30:27.420 --> 30:30.120
Jellyfish, turtles, sea urchin,

30:30.120 --> 30:31.920
and now scarlet macaw.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.500
What do they all have in common?

30:36.330 --> 30:37.960
A long lifespan.

30:37.960 --> 30:40.040
Exactly. Longer than a human's.

30:40.040 --> 30:42.080
So it means the UnSub

30:42.080 --> 30:44.960
may not be focused
on a specific disease,

30:44.960 --> 30:46.120
but longevity.

30:47.790 --> 30:51.380
Oh, God.
Guys, I think I know why the Magic Man

30:51.670 --> 30:53.460
thought this place is so magical.

30:53.920 --> 30:57.830
We are right around the corner
from the legendary Fountain of Youth.

31:04.420 --> 31:08.920
Please, please let me go.
I swear I won't tell anybody.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.460
You're beautiful.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.540
Your face is so youthful.

31:22.540 --> 31:23.920
Don't.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.670
Smooth and perfect.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.000
Soft, like it should be.

31:32.080 --> 31:33.380
You know...

31:35.210 --> 31:37.000
When I was seven years old,

31:37.500 --> 31:41.960
I went with my parents to visit an uncle
who was living in a nursing home.

31:44.830 --> 31:46.250
I got lost for a minute.

31:46.250 --> 31:48.500
I went into the wrong room by mistake.

31:49.750 --> 31:53.210
I thought it was my uncle, but it wasn't.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.500
He was terrible-looking.

31:57.500 --> 32:00.000
His face, it hardly looked human.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.380
And then he said,

32:01.380 --> 32:04.290
"What are you staring at, boy?"

32:04.290 --> 32:07.500
I couldn't answer, but I couldn't
stop looking at him, either.

32:10.210 --> 32:12.000
And then he said,

32:12.670 --> 32:14.920
"I'll tell you what you're staring at.

32:19.830 --> 32:21.000
"A mirror."

32:23.000 --> 32:24.420
No matter what you do,

32:25.170 --> 32:27.670
you'll end up just like me.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.710
Just like me.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.710
For months after that

32:46.710 --> 32:49.500
I would check my face
in the mirror every day

32:51.250 --> 32:53.000
to see if it was happening yet.

32:53.710 --> 32:55.120
You were just a child.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.120
You didn't know any better.

32:57.120 --> 32:59.290
But the old man was right.

33:00.250 --> 33:01.920
I knew unless I did something,

33:01.920 --> 33:03.290
I'd end up like that.

33:03.750 --> 33:05.080
Everybody would.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.420
People get old.

33:06.670 --> 33:07.960
It's natural.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.830
No.

33:12.170 --> 33:13.670
The answer is right here,

33:15.620 --> 33:17.330
practically under our feet.

33:17.330 --> 33:19.000
It has been for centuries.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.670
I need to apologize, Andrea.

33:38.540 --> 33:39.670
Apologize?

33:40.210 --> 33:41.380
I lied to you before.

33:42.500 --> 33:43.580
About what?

33:46.040 --> 33:47.580
That I wasn't going to hurt you.

33:47.580 --> 33:49.420
No, no. Stop!

34:11.210 --> 34:12.290
Ben.

34:12.670 --> 34:14.040
Honey, what's wrong?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.080
It's me, Ben Kebler.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.120
Something's gone wrong.

34:34.500 --> 34:37.000
-What's the matter?-My wife is having trouble breathing.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.500
-I'm going to call 911.-No!

34:40.500 --> 34:42.330
I have to. She's sick. She needs help.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.920
She needs another
transfusion, that's all.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.620
Well, then you come over here now

34:45.620 --> 34:47.380
-and you give her one!-I can't.

34:47.670 --> 34:48.830
Why not?

34:48.830 --> 34:50.790
It's safer if we do
the transfusions at my lab.

34:51.710 --> 34:52.750
What's going on?

34:55.290 --> 34:57.750
Does this have something to do
with what happened to Doctor Braga?

34:57.750 --> 34:59.830
The only chance your wife
has is with me.

35:00.210 --> 35:02.620
Now, here are the directions to my lab.

35:04.540 --> 35:06.420
I've got Garcia on the line.
She's got something.

35:06.420 --> 35:07.670
What is it, Garcia?

35:07.670 --> 35:09.460
Sir, you were right
about the scarlet macaw.

35:09.460 --> 35:10.710
They are very hard to find.

35:10.960 --> 35:13.040
When you can find one,
they're real pricey.

35:13.040 --> 35:16.540
However, a private zoo
outside of St. Augustine

35:16.540 --> 35:18.380
reported a macaw stolen.

35:18.380 --> 35:21.040
The owner suspected it
to be a former employee,

35:21.040 --> 35:23.040
but they didn't have any proof.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.750
I checked out this former employee,

35:25.170 --> 35:27.330
Bobby Boles, Bobby being
short for Robert,

35:27.330 --> 35:29.000
Robert being maybe our mad scientist.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.920
Did Robert Boles ever
go to medical school?

35:30.920 --> 35:35.170
Yeah, he totally did. He flunked out
in the middle of his first year, though.

35:35.170 --> 35:37.040
He's always been
sort of a misfit, it seems.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.210
How so?

35:38.210 --> 35:39.500
He was home-schooled
from an early age

35:39.500 --> 35:40.960
'cause he didn't fit in with other kids.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.250
Lots of childhood therapy.

35:42.250 --> 35:44.290
What did Boles do after he
dropped out of med school?

35:44.290 --> 35:46.000
Lots of part-time jobs.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.080
He currently works as an orderly

35:48.080 --> 35:50.250
at the same hospital as Dr. Braga.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.080
Where is he now?

35:53.080 --> 35:54.540
Uh, I can't find a physical address.

35:54.540 --> 35:56.120
He hasn't had one for a while.
I'll keep searching.

35:56.670 --> 35:58.040
Look, he's probably long gone,

35:58.040 --> 36:00.880
but we can check to see if Boles reports
for his next shift at the hospital.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.040
He might not know we're onto him.

36:02.040 --> 36:04.000
Only one of Dr. Braga's
patients didn't show up

36:04.000 --> 36:05.920
for their scheduled appointment
over the last two days,

36:05.920 --> 36:07.040
Eileen Kebler.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.170
We need to check her residence.

36:09.170 --> 36:11.880
Down this way at the end of the hall.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.080
What is this place?

36:13.080 --> 36:14.790
It's a former medical research facility.

36:14.790 --> 36:16.880
It's been closed up for years.
I'm leasing out a section.

36:16.880 --> 36:20.540
No! She needs help, real help.

36:21.710 --> 36:25.420
There's no time for anything else.
She needs a transfusion now.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.170
Stay here. Don't leave this room.

36:36.170 --> 36:37.330
I'll bring what we need.

36:37.330 --> 36:38.460
Hurry!

36:45.210 --> 36:46.830
I should have thought of this before.

36:46.830 --> 36:50.170
It's not just medicine.

36:50.170 --> 36:51.830
It's not just ingredients,

36:51.830 --> 36:53.580
it's an entire belief system.

36:53.580 --> 36:55.960
Aztecs...

36:56.710 --> 37:00.500
They were here first,
before anyone else.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.290
They understood...

37:04.420 --> 37:06.380
The power of the beating heart.

37:08.250 --> 37:09.330
Don't...

37:15.880 --> 37:18.000
When this is all through,

37:18.000 --> 37:21.830
people will remember you
and the sacrifice you made.

37:22.960 --> 37:26.460
Your name will be linked
with mine for all eternity.

37:32.460 --> 37:33.920
Hotch, I think I got something.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.080
What is it?

37:35.080 --> 37:37.750
It's Garcia's list of recent
saltwater aquarium customers.

37:37.750 --> 37:38.920
Is Robert Boles on the list?

37:38.920 --> 37:40.380
No, but he could have
used a fake name.

37:40.380 --> 37:42.750
It's where one shipment was delivered.

37:42.750 --> 37:44.960
The parking lot
of a closed medical facility.

37:48.120 --> 37:49.880
Okay, thanks, Garcia.

37:49.880 --> 37:51.420
All right, so, in high school

37:51.420 --> 37:53.420
Robert Boles got a summer job
at a gift shop

37:53.420 --> 37:55.420
near the Fountain of Youth
Archaeological Park.

37:55.420 --> 37:57.330
He got fired for breaking in after-hours.

37:57.330 --> 37:59.330
Maybe that's where the obsession
with eternal youth started.

38:07.710 --> 38:10.790
Hold on, Eileen. It's gonna be okay.

38:11.710 --> 38:13.880
It's cold.

38:15.420 --> 38:17.580
That's it. I'm getting an ambulance.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.500
No! You should have
stayed where you were.

38:34.120 --> 38:35.460
What are you doing?

38:35.460 --> 38:36.960
Do you want your wife to recover or not?

38:36.960 --> 38:38.120
You're not touching my wife.

38:38.120 --> 38:41.040
I'm gonna cure her,
and I won't let you get in the way.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.290
Robert Boles, drop the weapon.

38:45.750 --> 38:47.670
It's over, man. You're not getting out.

38:47.670 --> 38:49.540
Put the knife down, slowly.

38:53.380 --> 38:54.540
My wife needs help.

38:54.540 --> 38:55.920
-Where is she?
-In the next room.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.880
-Show me.
-Call an ambulance, please.

39:03.460 --> 39:05.120
I can do my research from prison.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.750
No one can stand
in the way of the future!

39:11.960 --> 39:13.580
-It's okay.
-

39:15.290 --> 39:16.380
You're okay.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.290
You're okay.

39:19.670 --> 39:21.380
It's okay. You're okay.

39:30.540 --> 39:31.620
Medics are on their way.

39:32.790 --> 39:34.000
How is she?

39:39.710 --> 39:40.920
What have I done?

39:42.380 --> 39:44.170
I'm cold.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.460
Eileen, stay with me.

39:47.330 --> 39:49.580
I'm always with you.

39:50.250 --> 39:52.170
Always.

40:04.830 --> 40:08.080
"The first condition
of immortality is death."

40:09.670 --> 40:11.000
Stanislaw Lec.

40:40.330 --> 40:42.920
Ice cream bad, yogurt good.

40:44.380 --> 40:46.830
Yogurt with ice cream, best.

40:48.330 --> 40:49.380
Ah...

40:51.250 --> 40:52.790
Well done, Penelope.

40:53.920 --> 40:55.250
You're making...

40:55.250 --> 40:57.210
You're making excellent choices.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.710
You're talking to yourself
way too much these days.

41:00.710 --> 41:03.420
But who wouldn't?
I'm cooped up in here all by myself.

41:04.290 --> 41:05.500
Garcia.

41:05.500 --> 41:07.290
- Sir, you scared me.
-You need to come with me right now.

41:07.290 --> 41:09.330
-Now now?
-Yes, now.

41:09.330 --> 41:11.080
But should I change? I'm in my PJs.

41:11.080 --> 41:13.580
I'll have someone bring you some
clothes. We don't have time to waste.

41:13.580 --> 41:15.170
Okay. Um...

41:16.120 --> 41:18.420
Sir, I'm scared. What's going on?

41:18.420 --> 41:20.710
There's been a major break in the case
of the hit men hunting you.

41:20.710 --> 41:22.000
There has?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.250
And we may have found a way
to bring the whole network down.

41:27.750 --> 41:31.250
