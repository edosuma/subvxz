00:45.840 --> 00:48.070
In the time of the Messiah,

00:48.680 --> 00:52.992
the Roman Empire grows
to span thousands of miles.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.673
It is an empire nourished by blood

00:56.800 --> 00:58.916
and secured by fear.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.112
They will take everything you have.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.636
They will invite you
to their games to watch others suffer

01:05.720 --> 01:07.119
and forget what you have lost.

01:09.520 --> 01:12.796
They will leave you with
nothing but bitterness...

01:14.960 --> 01:17.030
and desire for revenge.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.231
You should have stayed away.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.716
You should have killed me.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.032
I will.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.709
Don't burn out
your horse too soon.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.711
Three laps to go!

01:42.800 --> 01:44.438
Try keeping up, Judah!

01:44.520 --> 01:45.873
Don't embarrass yourself!

01:46.000 --> 01:47.228
Watch your back, brother!

01:47.320 --> 01:49.276
You're a prince, not a warrior!

01:49.360 --> 01:52.193
Prince Judah Ben-Hur, a Jew.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.549
Messala Severus,
his adopted brother, a Roman.

01:59.200 --> 02:03.671
They were as devoted to each
other as they were competitive.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.074
You're a cheat!

02:09.160 --> 02:10.798
Cheat? All is fair to you Romans!

02:10.880 --> 02:12.029
Oh, that's low!

02:12.120 --> 02:13.872
Judah's father passed away

02:14.000 --> 02:16.116
holding onto the hope
that the two brothers

02:16.240 --> 02:19.676
could be an example of unity
in this divided land.

02:19.760 --> 02:20.760
Cheat!

02:23.560 --> 02:24.720
One more lap to go!

02:55.560 --> 02:56.595
Judah.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.239
Judah!

03:02.800 --> 03:03.800
Judah!

03:07.920 --> 03:09.273
Help!

03:36.760 --> 03:39.274
Mother?

03:39.360 --> 03:41.669
Judah's hurt! Someone help!

03:41.760 --> 03:42.760
Mama!

03:42.840 --> 03:45.638
Nanny. Nanny, help.
Take him. Take him.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.669
- Careful, careful.
- What happened? Judah?

03:49.160 --> 03:50.354
Judah!

03:50.840 --> 03:52.640
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- Is he all right?

03:52.720 --> 03:54.336
- What happened?
- There was a rock.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.952
Mother?

03:56.040 --> 03:57.712
Quick, fetch a doctor for your brother.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.796
Tirzah! Run!

03:59.880 --> 04:01.120
- Esther?
- Yes, Father?

04:01.200 --> 04:02.952
Prepare the room for Master Judah.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.720
- Get water.
- Hurry, Esther.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.993
Careful, careful.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.873
Get some water.

04:08.960 --> 04:09.960
Up.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.428
He's badly hurt. What have you done?

04:13.520 --> 04:15.397
I haven't done anything.
It was an accident.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.197
Judah was thrown from his horse.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.874
- We were riding and...
- Racing!

04:19.959 --> 04:20.959
Mum...

04:22.120 --> 04:23.633
What should I do?

04:23.720 --> 04:26.553
You've done enough. Now pray.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.279
My son, will he live?

04:31.600 --> 04:32.976
- Minerva...
- He will recover.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.736
- The doctor reassured us.
- Mother Goddess,

04:34.760 --> 04:35.954
restore him by the skin.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.016
But, Mother, he looks
like he's in so much pain.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.996
Thank your Messala for that.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.831
Be strong, Master Judah.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.829
Wait. Wait.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.513
You are like an angel.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.434
Tirzah.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.119
Go to bed.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.873
Good night.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.589
We have different gods, Messala.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.633
Did we have fun?

07:38.160 --> 07:40.515
- Esther, dance with me.
- I'm not allowed.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.995
Well, we can give people
something to talk about.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.832
We can cause a scandal. Come on.

07:56.840 --> 07:57.875
Oh, let me help you.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.632
I have it. It's not your place.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.150
You know there's a whole
world beyond Jerusalem.

08:04.240 --> 08:07.152
Greece, Persia, Egypt.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.400
I just want to experience it.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.118
I'm tired of reading about it,

08:10.200 --> 08:12.236
hearing about it from travelers.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.436
- Are you?
- Yes.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.114
- But you make it sound so easy.
- It's not easy.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.634
But that's life.

08:19.720 --> 08:20.835
Tirzah.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.638
Could you help me
to my bedroom, please?

08:58.240 --> 09:01.198
You spend
too much idle time with Messala.

09:01.720 --> 09:04.837
If I didn't,
you'd have nothing to complain about.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.513
"Oh, have mercy on me, world!

09:12.600 --> 09:16.195
"Not one of my 359 gods
will smile upon me."

09:16.280 --> 09:18.350
Don't mock.

09:18.440 --> 09:21.318
What's wrong with you?
It's supposed to be a celebration.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.516
It's a celebration of your faith, not mine.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.239
Well, that's the virtue of wine.
It doesn't discriminate.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.016
So what happened with you and Tirzah?

09:28.040 --> 09:30.031
Your mother doesn't want us speaking.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.553
And who cares what Mother wants?

09:31.640 --> 09:33.358
Your mother cares.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.509
And?

09:35.880 --> 09:38.792
- Listen, Judah, I...
- You have feelings for Tirzah.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.199
Messala, admit it.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.918
What am I supposed to do with them?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.513
You and your family are royalty.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.556
And what does that matter?

09:45.640 --> 09:47.056
I'd rather she was paying attention to you

09:47.080 --> 09:48.559
than some other brute.

09:48.640 --> 09:49.675
Thanks.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.656
I'm not saying you're a brute,
I'm saying you're brutish.

09:51.680 --> 09:52.749
Oh...

09:52.840 --> 09:55.593
Simonides, go to bed. Messala!

09:56.320 --> 09:58.515
- You and Tirzah would be like...
- Like what?

09:58.600 --> 10:02.309
Like we were family.
We're not family, are we?

10:02.600 --> 10:03.874
Are we?

10:03.960 --> 10:06.633
I'm just a lowly orphan
your family took in.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.631
Oh, my God. Of course we're family!

10:08.720 --> 10:10.995
You're my brother.
You'll always be my brother.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.911
Everything I own is yours.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.832
No. I'll never have your name.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.296
And every time my name is spoken,

10:16.320 --> 10:19.039
it will be spoken alongside
stories of my grandfather.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.439
Until I earn it back.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.438
Messala, wait. Wait!

10:27.760 --> 10:29.079
Messala.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.840
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Rome.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.280
Wait. What do you mean,
you're going to Rome?

10:34.320 --> 10:35.435
Messala, stop.

10:35.520 --> 10:38.796
The Emperor's called for men to put
down the rebellion in Germania.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.869
He's called for idiots to fight and die.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.069
I can't believe this.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.456
After everything we've done for you,

10:46.480 --> 10:48.480
you still want to go and fight
for those murderers!

10:48.560 --> 10:49.993
The pay's steady.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.308
"The pay's steady"?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.550
So I can come back to Tirzah
with stature and wealth.

10:53.640 --> 10:54.993
But wealth doesn't mean anything.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.040
- It never does if you're rich.
- Messala, please.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.189
Look, tell Tirzah...

10:58.280 --> 10:59.976
If you have something
to say to her, say it yourself.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.036
Otherwise you're just walking away.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.069
Judah?

11:19.680 --> 11:21.033
Where's Messala?

11:32.040 --> 11:33.473
Messala,

11:33.560 --> 11:36.199
I hope this letter finds
you well, if at all.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.679
As with all the others
I've sent over the past three years,

11:39.800 --> 11:41.836
I expect no response.

11:44.760 --> 11:48.992
I can only hope that it is by your choice
and not by the way of your demise.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.310
I always prefer
not to see my food before I eat it.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.674
That's probably the best idea.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.751
You would hardly recognize
your Jerusalem now.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.056
What? What are you looking at?

11:57.080 --> 11:58.149
The circus.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.736
The Romans continue
to leave their mark

11:59.760 --> 12:01.637
and build their circus.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.473
When you come home,
I will honor the monstrosity

12:04.560 --> 12:07.358
by humiliating you in one of those
chariots you Romans so love.

12:07.440 --> 12:08.440
Yes, of course.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.994
But, brother, I do have news to tell you.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.115
Here, try it.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.349
Two months ago,

12:14.440 --> 12:17.352
Esther's father found
a wealthy Roman for her to marry.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.317
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.120
We still have to find you
something special.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.776
Oh, no, that's okay. I don't want anything.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.473
I gave my blessing knowing
in my heart it was a mistake.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.040
I was reminded of how
I used to jest to Mother

12:29.080 --> 12:30.200
that one day we would wed...

12:30.280 --> 12:31.793
Go with God.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.351
Knowing the thought
of her son, a prince,

12:34.480 --> 12:37.233
marrying a servant
would send her to an early grave.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.319
I couldn't let her go.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.471
If you leave me,
you leave me with nothing.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.470
She is now my wife, brother.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.877
Despite the wonderful life
we have together,

13:07.960 --> 13:10.315
Rome has come to lay
a hard hand on the city.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.119
Repeated attacks have left
them with little patience.

13:13.880 --> 13:17.236
Thankfully,
we've been able to retain their favor.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.673
Well, for now.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.239
Hear my plea.

13:21.560 --> 13:24.233
Be safe. Return home.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.550
I will listen to stories of your travels.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.675
Judah.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.000
- What have you found?
- I don't know what it is.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.270
I know what this is!
This is a Senet board.

13:32.360 --> 13:33.760
- How much for this?
- Five shekels.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.594
A Zealot,
and that he will be subject today

13:37.680 --> 13:42.071
to the customary punishment
of crucifixion.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.276
- No!
- May his punishment

13:44.360 --> 13:47.397
stand as a warning.

13:51.880 --> 13:55.111
- Ah, the Zealots.
- All they want is freedom.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.474
And at what cost?

13:56.560 --> 13:57.629
If they had their way,

13:57.720 --> 13:58.816
they'll bring the whole
of Rome down on us.

13:58.840 --> 13:59.856
Then where will our freedom be?

13:59.880 --> 14:01.536
- How much is it? Five?
- Thank you, My Lord.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.551
There's freedom elsewhere.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.869
Excuse me?

14:06.280 --> 14:07.759
Love your enemies.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.231
"Love your enemies."
Well, that's very progressive.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.233
It's the truth.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.556
God is love.
He made us to share that love.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.536
And where will your love be
when the Romans

14:21.560 --> 14:23.232
turn their anger on the rest of us?

14:23.440 --> 14:25.271
Hate and fear are lies.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.040
They turn us against each other.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.993
Those are the lies that make us slaves.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.230
He has a path planned for you.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.719
If He has a path planned for me,

14:34.800 --> 14:36.392
how am I better off than a slave?

14:39.200 --> 14:40.918
Why don't you ask her?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.228
Esther.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.717
There's truth to what he's saying.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.199
There must be something better.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.672
Better than what?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.155
Look around you.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.376
The roads are lined
with the sick and poor.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.736
We should be grateful
we're not one of them.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.936
- Can you spare something, please?
- We can be more than grateful.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.475
Esther, I'm not denying
the fact that the world is a cruel place.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.376
But it's our responsibility
to take care of ourselves

15:15.400 --> 15:16.719
and the ones we love.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.473
If people took care
of themselves, we'd all be saved.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.433
If God is righteous,
then we should do righteous things.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.353
If there is a God, then why
doesn't He do right by the world?

15:45.320 --> 15:46.912
Come. Follow me.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.878
Follow me.
Follow me. This way.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.551
Let's go. Stay with me.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.073
Who's there?

16:26.560 --> 16:30.599
Jacob, stop. He's my brother.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.398
Put the knife down.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.873
Put it down.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.198
Judah.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.315
- What happened to him?
- He's wounded.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.960
- Yes, I can see that. How?
- The cemetery.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.992
Romans take the stones of our ancestors

17:05.079 --> 17:06.308
to build their circus.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.470
Not anymore.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.119
- You're Zealots!
- We fight for your freedom.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.079
From what I can see,
you get young boys injured.

17:13.760 --> 17:14.760
We need a doctor.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.836
No, a doctor would
inform the centurions.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.672
Go and get a candle. Go.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.039
I need your knife.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.039
What's your name?

17:34.920 --> 17:37.036
- Dismas.
- Dismas.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.428
I hope you're proud of yourselves.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.638
You know our aim.

17:45.720 --> 17:49.030
Independence from Caesar,
ending the occupation of the Holy Land.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.350
- By killing Romans?
- We settle scores.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.431
Not here. Not in Jerusalem.

17:53.520 --> 17:57.479
Dismas, it's a little bit
of pain and then it's done.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.119
Let me see.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.079
You're a part of this?

18:09.520 --> 18:11.192
The man you love is a Roman!

18:11.280 --> 18:12.508
We don't kill all Romans.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.670
Well, that's not very
comforting to the dead ones.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.397
If your father was alive,
he would support us.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.516
You, I don't know,
so you can shut your mouth.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.194
This is your home,
this is your land, too.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.838
They turn our brothers into slaves

18:23.920 --> 18:25.512
and that doesn't move you?

18:25.600 --> 18:27.192
Killing doesn't get us up from under.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.714
- Being passive has done what?
- It keeps the peace.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.199
You confuse peace with freedom.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.594
Jacob.

18:32.680 --> 18:36.070
The High Priests,
you in the privileged class...

18:36.160 --> 18:38.993
You get Caesar's favor
in exchange for obedience.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.192
The rest of us get scraps.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.513
I won't condone violence.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.999
Nobody's asking your permission.

18:57.560 --> 19:01.792
You keep my family
and my house clean of this.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.599
Now get out.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.240
- The boy?
- He's safe here.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.639
Safer than with you.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.832
I said get out!

19:24.440 --> 19:26.556
You know, Mother has
hopes for a grandchild.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.631
She asks me every day. I tell her, "Soon."

19:30.120 --> 19:32.998
But I know "soon"
isn't soon enough for her.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.119
That sounds wonderful.

19:48.440 --> 19:49.440
Judah Ben-Hur?

19:49.840 --> 19:51.193
- Yes?
- Follow us.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.536
Where are you taking him?

19:52.560 --> 19:54.080
Don't worry, we've done nothing wrong.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.917
It's all right, go inside.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.713
I've brought the Jew.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.910
I haven't changed that much, have I?

20:33.160 --> 20:34.752
You look like one of those statues

20:34.840 --> 20:36.990
you Romans insist on
putting everywhere.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.630
You look like the clay
they make them from.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.757
Statues are made of marble, not clay.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.353
Not the one they'd make of you.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.353
Look at this.

21:08.720 --> 21:09.789
Wow.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.710
Well, come on, tell me.
Tell me everything.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.308
Up Mars!

21:26.880 --> 21:28.472
Move forward!

21:28.840 --> 21:30.671
Move forward!

21:31.600 --> 21:33.536
I'm not sure
you want to hear everything.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.516
And you were right
about life as a soldier.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.108
Sleepless nights in the mud.
Cold and wet.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.592
Drusus, move forward!

21:42.680 --> 21:45.069
- If we stay here, we'll die!
- Then you go!

21:45.520 --> 21:46.748
One night in Persia...

21:46.840 --> 21:47.909
Your name?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.274
I met him.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.955
- Your name!
- Messala Severus.

21:53.080 --> 21:57.596
Captain Messala Severus.
These are your men now.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.590
- Start leading!
- Sir!

22:00.680 --> 22:02.910
His name was Pontius Pilate.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.592
He gave me a chance.

22:04.680 --> 22:07.319
He reminded me of
what we were fighting for.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.038
Things you and I believe in, Judah.

22:09.720 --> 22:13.554
A civilized world, progress,
prosperity, stability.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.271
I battled and marched through countries

22:17.360 --> 22:20.477
and across continents
I'd once dreamed of.

22:31.560 --> 22:34.870
I led my men from battle to battle,
to the heights of glory.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.520
But we crushed the freedom
of innocent civilizations

22:38.560 --> 22:40.790
simply because they were different.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.631
I saw much blood spilled.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.755
More than I can describe.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.399
Attention!

22:52.480 --> 22:54.994
My true fight became
with my commander,

22:55.080 --> 22:56.399
Marcus.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.158
Why haven't you attacked the city?

23:00.240 --> 23:02.595
An attack wasn't needed.
My orders were to pacify the city.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.477
Leaving no able-bodied man alive.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.477
Well, who will till the field or harvest...

23:06.600 --> 23:09.876
We need to stamp out
revolt in every corner of the Empire.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.996
If you want to offer up
another lifeless husk

23:12.080 --> 23:13.752
- to the Empire...
- Messala Severus?

23:14.200 --> 23:16.919
We've heard the stories
about your grandfather.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.271
His hand in betraying Julius Caesar.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.590
And how he wailed
when he was crucified.

23:24.760 --> 23:28.116
In spite of that,
I'm thankful Pilate's on my side, brother.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.915
More thankful to see you.

23:31.960 --> 23:33.188
Me, too.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.520
To think you were just
a lowly Hur before you left.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.000
Well, Mother missed you every day.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.636
Ah, I'm sorry I left you alone with her.

23:46.480 --> 23:47.629
Tirzah?

23:48.120 --> 23:49.473
How is she?

23:49.880 --> 23:51.711
Tirzah's good, she's well.

23:53.880 --> 23:54.960
Judah, will you tell her...

23:55.040 --> 23:57.120
No, you can tell her yourself.
She's not yet married.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.119
My God, you still have it.

24:04.320 --> 24:05.639
Why didn't you write?

24:06.680 --> 24:08.193
What would I say?

24:09.920 --> 24:13.151
I don't know.
That you're alive? That you're well?

24:13.760 --> 24:15.716
Anything would have sufficed.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.153
Judah,

24:17.280 --> 24:19.953
I had to be able to come back
on my own terms.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.238
Your family gave me everything.

24:23.040 --> 24:25.713
I wanted to be able to return the favor.

24:25.800 --> 24:26.915
Now I can.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.957
Mmm. Judah, listen.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.520
- I need your help.
- Messala.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.754
You're needed outside.
There's been another attack.

24:48.840 --> 24:50.637
Stretcher bearer, over here.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.436
What's being said about Pontius Pilate?

24:53.520 --> 24:54.919
To be honest, nothing good.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.016
In a few days, he wants
to ride through Jerusalem

24:58.040 --> 24:59.473
at the head of a legion.

24:59.720 --> 25:00.869
Why?

25:01.720 --> 25:03.472
The Zealots.

25:03.560 --> 25:06.518
I've tried to deal with them peacefully.
Peace doesn't work.

25:07.040 --> 25:10.396
- So now you try a legion.
- That's not my choice.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.751
All they want from Rome
is their land back.

25:14.440 --> 25:17.318
It was never their land.
It belonged to you, the wealthy.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.960
You don't really believe
in a return to the Age of Solomon.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.216
When the Zealots
are done with us, they'll turn on you.

25:22.240 --> 25:25.118
I don't care about their politics.
I just care about keeping the peace.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.269
Then we're agreed!

25:26.360 --> 25:28.635
Look, Zealots are the common enemy.

25:28.720 --> 25:31.871
Listen, you're a prince.
You have the ear of your people.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.994
Pontius Pilate has to
ride through Jerusalem with no trouble.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.911
That's all I'm asking.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.918
Brother, I've been away a long time.

25:40.880 --> 25:44.190
If I come back now,
believe me, it's important.

25:47.440 --> 25:48.919
I want to give you this.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.631
I've done a lot of work with this.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.473
It would give me nothing but joy

25:56.560 --> 25:59.074
to know it was in your hands
and lay forever idle.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.789
I'll speak to my people,
find out what I can.

26:10.920 --> 26:11.920
Thank you.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.312
- But you must come to dinner.
- I will.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.595
But nothing special. Just a simple meal.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.711
I promise. A simple meal.

26:22.920 --> 26:23.936
What's this about?

26:23.960 --> 26:26.872
There's been an attack
at the cemetery. Zealots.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.188
Breathing still?

26:28.280 --> 26:30.430
This is Vilarius. I know him.

26:30.520 --> 26:33.034
Pull him out. Brother...

26:33.120 --> 26:35.680
Lost quite a bit of blood.

26:36.800 --> 26:37.994
Messala.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.192
What happened, Lucius?

26:52.640 --> 26:53.993
Zealots.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.475
They poured through
the encampment under cover of night.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.231
We had no way of...

27:00.320 --> 27:03.710
The people's gratitude
for your bloodless suppression.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.199
What were your men doing here?

27:06.160 --> 27:08.913
Orders were to gather stones
to build the circus.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.672
You understand this is sacred land.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.677
These are Judean graves.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.111
I'm informing Pilate.

27:15.680 --> 27:19.912
If you rule as occupiers,
you will be met with disaster, I promise.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.958
Are you as treasonous
as you are useless?

27:28.400 --> 27:29.958
That's my brother's bow.

27:30.360 --> 27:31.679
You should be resting.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.274
I'm fine.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.791
I need to redress the wound.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.189
Sit.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.480
Well, if you want to
call anywhere home again,

27:50.560 --> 27:51.879
you'll need to be more careful.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.111
The people you run with now are trouble.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.336
I see they've sold you
on the romance of fighting,

27:57.360 --> 27:58.496
but the reality is very different.

27:58.520 --> 27:59.999
How would you know?

28:01.400 --> 28:04.198
I know when I found you,
you were almost dead.

28:04.680 --> 28:06.352
And for what?

28:06.440 --> 28:07.936
So you can say
you evened up with the Romans?

28:07.960 --> 28:10.155
We're not trying to balance anything.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.520
We want the freedom we were born with.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.056
And if the Romans won't give it to us,
we'll have to take it by force.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.911
How many Romans do you even know?

28:17.560 --> 28:20.677
Have you ever had a conversation
with a single one in your life?

28:21.320 --> 28:23.601
Don't spit your hate for all
when you don't even know one.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.595
Now, you're welcome to stay
here as long as you need.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.576
When you're well,
you should go back to your family.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.919
I should.

28:31.520 --> 28:34.671
But my father was able-bodied,
so the Romans killed him.

28:35.920 --> 28:39.435
My mother was fertile,
so they did other things to her.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.033
Everybody, just act normal.

28:53.680 --> 28:54.680
He's coming.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.911
Oh, for God's sake, more normal.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.439
Welcome home.

29:04.920 --> 29:08.276
This is Captain Drusus,
my second-in-command.

29:08.360 --> 29:10.191
- Greetings.
- To you, Prince.

29:10.280 --> 29:11.679
I owe this man my life.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.280
We have something in common, at least.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.200
I have a small gift from my travels.

29:29.280 --> 29:32.113
The finest silk in all of Egypt.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.957
It reminded me of you.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.353
Your return is gift enough for me.

30:01.520 --> 30:02.999
So

30:03.680 --> 30:05.796
You never got married.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.553
Don't they teach subtlety
in Caesar's army?

30:10.600 --> 30:12.591
You must have a hundred men
fighting over you.

30:12.680 --> 30:13.829
A few.

30:14.760 --> 30:16.512
But you spoiled me for others.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.670
- Oh, don't say that!
- It's true.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.272
Well, you should be happy.
You deserve to be.

30:25.440 --> 30:28.432
I know. I look like a monster.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.998
Nothing like one.

30:31.640 --> 30:34.393
You know this scar, of course.

30:34.520 --> 30:37.080
- This one I got in Germania.
- Germania?

30:37.160 --> 30:38.957
The other one I can't show you. I...

30:39.040 --> 30:40.760
I was run through,
I thought fatally, and...

30:43.160 --> 30:44.878
As I lay there, I...

30:45.960 --> 30:47.837
I wished I could see you again.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.150
Talk to you one last time.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.519
Messala!

30:57.720 --> 30:59.233
Let me show you something.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.869
I may kill your brother one day.

31:07.440 --> 31:09.237
I may kill him first.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.240
You know, your mother
used to interrupt us.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.315
Now you do.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.152
- We have a lot to catch up on.
- Indeed.

31:15.880 --> 31:17.279
It is striking.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.669
Now tell me something
honestly. Look me in the eyes.

31:19.760 --> 31:22.120
How many men does it take
to get you dressed in the morning?

31:24.280 --> 31:26.475
- That's an honest question.
- Yeah.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.551
Doesn't he look just like Zeus?

31:28.760 --> 31:30.955
You know, he's twice as fast, though.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.758
And I knew you'd appreciate him.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.592
Cost me a small fortune.

31:37.720 --> 31:40.188
He really is a beautiful horse.

31:40.280 --> 31:41.508
Yes, he is.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.953
So you spoke with your people.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.036
Yes. I spoke to some of the local rabbis

31:45.120 --> 31:47.000
and opinion makers,
and most of them want peace.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.753
So who's against us?

31:49.560 --> 31:52.472
Some local thugs and radicals.
No one of any importance.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.913
Right, but who?

31:54.520 --> 31:56.078
Messala, they don't matter.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.016
But, Judah, if they don't matter,
then tell me who they are.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.155
What are their names?

31:59.960 --> 32:01.757
I'm not going to name names.

32:01.840 --> 32:03.040
So you're going to stand idle,

32:03.120 --> 32:05.111
even though you know who the guilty are.

32:05.920 --> 32:09.754
To be honest, no one's guilty of anything
except being sick of Rome's oppression.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.915
Are you aware who's riding to this city?

32:13.320 --> 32:15.038
Did I make that clear?

32:15.160 --> 32:16.912
Death or peace.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.198
I've tried every other way.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.056
And they spit my grandfather's
name in my face

32:21.080 --> 32:22.399
- and ridicule me!
- Oh, my God.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.896
After all these years, you still sound like

32:23.920 --> 32:25.956
that Roman orphan who
turned up on our doorstep.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.190
Judah, you promised to help me!

32:28.280 --> 32:30.840
No, I said I would speak
to the people. And I have.

32:30.920 --> 32:33.753
I don't need you to speak to them.
I need you to sway them.

32:33.840 --> 32:35.068
And if you can't do that,

32:35.160 --> 32:37.071
then I need you to tell me
who our enemies are.

32:37.160 --> 32:38.878
Because we've run out of time.

32:39.560 --> 32:41.278
Judah, please.

32:42.320 --> 32:45.676
Please, I need you to help me.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.072
Messala, I won't be bullied
into this decision.

32:54.520 --> 32:55.520
Judah!

32:55.840 --> 32:58.149
- Messala! Dinner!
- Oh...

32:58.920 --> 33:01.434
Come on, let's get something to eat.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.235
This is how Jerusalem welcomes us?

33:53.320 --> 33:56.357
Tribune Messala has promised
there'll be no trouble.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.712
I've spoken to prominent citizens.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.997
Your safety is their highest priority.

34:11.560 --> 34:12.993
What is that?

34:13.080 --> 34:14.478
- Stay here.
- Why?

34:14.560 --> 34:15.754
Please.

34:16.239 --> 34:17.389
Tirzah?

34:17.480 --> 34:19.277
Tirzah, wait for me.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.355
No!

35:18.960 --> 35:19.960
Sir!

35:20.160 --> 35:21.673
Testudo!

35:22.440 --> 35:24.317
- Testudo!
- Protect!

35:25.640 --> 35:26.789
Shields up!

35:28.640 --> 35:29.993
Ready arrows!

35:30.080 --> 35:31.080
Judah!

35:31.600 --> 35:33.716
Down! Mother, get Tirzah down!

35:34.840 --> 35:37.673
Find the ones who did this and kill them!

35:38.480 --> 35:40.391
You're responsible! Fix it!

35:41.680 --> 35:43.910
Tirzah, move! Get inside. Inside!

35:44.200 --> 35:45.519
Move!

35:46.800 --> 35:48.472
Step aside!

35:48.840 --> 35:50.876
Open this door!

35:51.000 --> 35:52.672
Break down the door.

35:58.360 --> 36:00.157
Open the door!

36:01.160 --> 36:03.469
Open this door!

36:03.560 --> 36:04.959
Dismas!

36:07.120 --> 36:08.269
What have you done?

36:08.360 --> 36:10.715
Do you realize what you've just done?

36:11.040 --> 36:12.536
Then get ready
to down this door!

36:12.560 --> 36:14.278
- Run!
- Take cover!

36:14.400 --> 36:16.152
Go. Go!

36:18.040 --> 36:19.314
We're friends of Rome.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.789
This house is sovereign. This house...

36:21.880 --> 36:23.757
Simonides!

36:23.840 --> 36:25.910
On the ground with all of them!

36:26.000 --> 36:28.150
- Search every room.
- Mother!

36:28.240 --> 36:29.960
Drag every one
of them in here, now!

36:30.040 --> 36:32.270
I have to speak
to Messala Severus. He knows me!

36:32.360 --> 36:34.510
If they resist, kill them.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.830
- Come with me!
- Please, don't leave them!

36:36.920 --> 36:38.717
- Tirzah!
- Get down here!

36:38.880 --> 36:40.791
What are you doing?
Leave my daughter alone!

36:40.880 --> 36:43.678
Wait, please! Please! No!

36:44.880 --> 36:46.074
Please!

36:48.560 --> 36:49.834
Listen to us!

36:49.920 --> 36:51.433
I'll take all collaborators!

36:51.560 --> 36:52.560
Judah!

36:52.640 --> 36:54.995
Who shot the arrow?

36:56.320 --> 36:57.639
Who shot the arrow?

36:59.400 --> 37:01.197
Who shot...

37:08.720 --> 37:10.438
No, wait! Please!

37:10.520 --> 37:11.589
Wait!

37:28.520 --> 37:31.193
Confess your crime!

37:31.280 --> 37:33.111
We've done nothing.
We've done nothing!

37:33.200 --> 37:36.431
Confess your crime,
or they all stand accused!

37:36.520 --> 37:37.794
Accused of what?

37:39.280 --> 37:40.554
Messala!

37:40.640 --> 37:42.119
Messala, help us!

37:42.800 --> 37:44.791
Messala, please help us!

37:45.800 --> 37:47.677
Search every room!

37:48.080 --> 37:49.080
Messala!

37:49.160 --> 37:50.673
The arrow!

37:50.760 --> 37:52.910
Who shot the arrow?

37:55.160 --> 37:58.152
Who shot the arrow?

38:10.440 --> 38:11.839
Brother, don't!

38:12.160 --> 38:13.513
Ah, here's your friend.

38:13.600 --> 38:14.919
Messala?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.513
Messala, please help us.

38:16.760 --> 38:18.591
So you don't harbor Zealots.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.510
Messala? Messala?

38:23.520 --> 38:26.956
No one here has done anything.
I beg you, please,

38:27.040 --> 38:28.871
defend this house.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.232
You make the order.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.193
It was me.

38:40.200 --> 38:42.111
It was me, I did it. I confess!

38:42.200 --> 38:44.191
Judah, what are you doing?

38:44.640 --> 38:46.278
Please, take me.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.351
My family, they have done nothing wrong.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.958
I confess, please.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.632
He's confessed.

38:52.720 --> 38:54.233
Zealots don't use women, Marcus.

38:54.360 --> 38:55.998
There's no reason to keep them here.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.036
You promised entry without incident.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.195
Did you lie or do you collaborate?

39:01.320 --> 39:04.392
- You're calling me a traitor?
- Messala, what's the order?

39:09.880 --> 39:11.871
Messala, please don't do it.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.719
Take them all.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.673
Take them all!

39:15.880 --> 39:17.791
- Come on then.
- No!

39:17.880 --> 39:20.678
Get up. On your feet.

39:20.760 --> 39:21.909
No!

39:22.400 --> 39:24.520
Be quick about it.
Bring the servants, too.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.152
Please, Messala! No!

39:38.320 --> 39:40.896
Drusus, this is insanity!
You know we've done nothing wrong.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.040
Women to the cross, men to the galleys!

39:44.360 --> 39:46.749
- No! No!
- Judah!

39:47.760 --> 39:49.273
I've taken the blame!

39:50.080 --> 39:52.753
I've taken the blame!
I've taken the blame!

39:52.840 --> 39:54.273
Stop it.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.233
Calm down, Judah!

39:58.040 --> 39:59.109
Stay back.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.434
Stay back!

40:03.440 --> 40:05.556
Stay back! I'll kill him!

40:13.360 --> 40:14.429
I'll kill him.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.713
I swear, I'll kill him!

40:17.040 --> 40:18.632
It won't save them.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.791
Where have they taken them?

40:21.200 --> 40:23.270
- Where are they?
- They're gone.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.598
They're beyond us both.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.233
Step back!

40:38.800 --> 40:40.313
They'll kill them.

40:40.560 --> 40:41.880
Messala, please, I'm begging you.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.069
I begged you!

40:43.160 --> 40:45.071
I asked you
brother-to-brother to help me.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.639
And you chose the traitors over me!

40:47.080 --> 40:48.911
And they betrayed you.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.936
Rome's calling for blood.
I have to give them some.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.279
Look at me, please, brother.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.316
I would never do this to you.
I would never...

40:55.640 --> 40:57.312
You killed them both.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.714
Whatever happens now, you did this!

41:10.480 --> 41:11.833
Keep moving!

41:15.360 --> 41:17.669
All the way back. Back!

41:19.600 --> 41:20.669
Judah!

41:23.160 --> 41:24.388
Judah!

41:25.160 --> 41:26.195
Esther.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.669
Where are you going?

41:32.680 --> 41:34.193
- Hold!
- Please!

41:34.520 --> 41:37.193
- On your feet.
- Please show mercy!

41:39.080 --> 41:40.399
On your feet!

41:41.800 --> 41:43.950
I said on your feet!

41:47.640 --> 41:49.676
- Not here.
- Please, he needs water.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.716
- Please!
- No water for him!

41:52.680 --> 41:54.159
Someone help us.

42:18.360 --> 42:19.509
Drink.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.393
Thank you.

42:41.320 --> 42:43.231
You would do the same.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.958
Get up, Judah.

42:57.760 --> 42:58.760
- Now.
- Move.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.199
Judah!

43:02.400 --> 43:05.312
- Where are you taking them?
- To the Port of Tyrus.

43:06.760 --> 43:08.318
To the galleys?

43:08.400 --> 43:09.640
- You can't!
- My family.

43:12.760 --> 43:14.113
Judah.

43:44.440 --> 43:45.640
- Move!
- Go on.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.869
Move! Move!

44:04.560 --> 44:05.959
Number 61.

44:06.800 --> 44:08.313
Sit down.

44:11.320 --> 44:13.311
Sit down.

44:27.160 --> 44:29.276
Starboard side clear!

44:31.360 --> 44:33.749
Stand by, bow!

44:33.840 --> 44:35.193
Hands on.

44:37.480 --> 44:40.677
Let's lift the line, oarsmen!

44:40.760 --> 44:43.877
Please, sir, this has been a mistake.

44:43.960 --> 44:46.793
- My family, they're innocent...
- You won't see them again.

44:47.680 --> 44:48.680
Not in this life.

44:48.760 --> 44:51.069
- Put it down!
- Follow me now!

44:52.560 --> 44:54.790
Drum! And...

44:54.920 --> 44:55.920
Row!

44:58.480 --> 44:59.674
Trident!

45:02.080 --> 45:03.080
Move!

45:12.240 --> 45:13.719
Wake up!

45:14.200 --> 45:15.633
Quickly.

46:01.240 --> 46:03.435
Ionian water!

46:03.800 --> 46:05.279
Contact imminent!

46:08.320 --> 46:11.232
Give yourselves over to the drum!

46:20.040 --> 46:21.996
Why are we so slow?

46:23.080 --> 46:25.833
We will not lose this battle
before we start.

46:27.280 --> 46:28.838
- Ladder down!
- Coming down!

46:29.720 --> 46:31.472
Prepare for battle!

46:32.320 --> 46:35.232
Full speed! Stick to it!

46:43.800 --> 46:45.119
Oars up.

46:45.560 --> 46:47.039
Oars up!

46:48.680 --> 46:50.511
Why are we so slow?

46:52.320 --> 46:53.355
We need to wake them up.

47:14.920 --> 47:16.433
Change him out.

47:19.200 --> 47:21.714
- No, please. Please, I'm fine.
- Get out!

47:21.960 --> 47:23.279
I'm... Please.

47:23.400 --> 47:24.913
- I said, out!
- Please!

47:26.960 --> 47:28.313
You're done!

47:29.680 --> 47:32.990
- Get out!
- I can row! I am a strong man.

47:33.120 --> 47:35.080
- Give me that!
- I beg you. No, please!

47:35.240 --> 47:36.355
Enough!

47:36.440 --> 47:37.555
No, don't.

47:37.640 --> 47:39.278
Take him out.

47:39.360 --> 47:40.998
Don't care.

47:41.080 --> 47:42.080
Just survive.

47:42.160 --> 47:43.798
Forget about them!

47:44.200 --> 47:46.668
For there is no "you" anymore!

47:47.400 --> 47:50.153
This ship is your body.

47:50.520 --> 47:53.751
That drum is your heartbeat!

47:54.120 --> 47:56.076
And your god

47:56.480 --> 47:58.550
is the glory of Rome!

48:00.720 --> 48:03.029
If this ship goes down,

48:03.520 --> 48:04.999
so do you.

48:06.240 --> 48:07.832
Chains.

48:07.920 --> 48:09.672
Raise the trident!

48:09.760 --> 48:12.797
Free to engage! Quickly!

48:12.880 --> 48:13.949
Ready!

48:16.120 --> 48:17.640
Get ready!

48:20.680 --> 48:21.715
Chains!

48:26.440 --> 48:27.440
You, too!

48:28.560 --> 48:29.959
Catapults ready!

48:30.440 --> 48:33.273
Fire pit ready! Open the oil barrels!

48:33.680 --> 48:35.033
We should do something.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.997
- We should do something.
- We should.

48:37.480 --> 48:39.516
When they pass,
you should bow your head.

48:39.600 --> 48:41.158
When they strike, take it.

48:41.320 --> 48:42.355
You can't beat them.

48:42.480 --> 48:43.480
Climb the ladder!

48:44.160 --> 48:46.435
All you can do is outlive them.

48:46.680 --> 48:49.353
We ram! We ram hard!

48:49.920 --> 48:51.751
Reverse with everything we have.

48:52.480 --> 48:54.198
Oars!

48:54.600 --> 48:55.874
Sink them.

48:55.960 --> 48:59.316
Not one Greek will step aboard my ship.

49:00.080 --> 49:01.752
Do you understand me?

49:02.760 --> 49:03.760
Drum!

49:07.480 --> 49:09.436
All together!

49:09.520 --> 49:10.520
And...

49:11.400 --> 49:13.072
Row!

49:18.080 --> 49:19.877
- Catapults.
- Catapults ready!

49:21.240 --> 49:22.514
Fireballs.

49:23.520 --> 49:24.520
And move!

49:24.600 --> 49:27.239
Let us make this a glorious day

49:28.000 --> 49:29.319
for Rome!

49:31.160 --> 49:32.309
Battle speed!

49:32.600 --> 49:34.352
Battle speed!

49:35.000 --> 49:36.194
Approaching!

49:36.920 --> 49:38.592
Twenty-nine!

49:38.680 --> 49:40.318
Twenty-eight!

49:40.400 --> 49:41.719
Twenty-seven!

49:41.800 --> 49:43.518
In the pitch!

49:44.200 --> 49:45.235
Twenty-five!

49:45.320 --> 49:47.151
Ramming speed!

49:47.720 --> 49:49.711
Ramming speed!

49:49.960 --> 49:51.598
Twenty-two!

49:51.680 --> 49:54.148
Twenty-one! Twenty!

49:54.240 --> 49:56.515
Ship down on the starboard side!

50:05.720 --> 50:07.472
Thirteen!

50:07.560 --> 50:08.834
Twelve!

50:09.040 --> 50:11.873
Eleven! Ten!

50:11.960 --> 50:13.279
Blades in!

50:16.920 --> 50:18.831
Brace for impact!

50:31.200 --> 50:33.668
Drum! Where's the drum?

50:35.560 --> 50:36.709
Reverse!

50:41.760 --> 50:44.399
And row!

50:54.720 --> 50:56.312
Greeks on board!

50:56.400 --> 50:57.594
Reverse!

50:58.920 --> 50:59.920
Reverse!

51:02.320 --> 51:03.753
Reverse on my count!

51:09.600 --> 51:11.431
- Help me!
- Die!

51:13.080 --> 51:14.399
Hands on! Hands on oar!

51:15.600 --> 51:17.511
Arrows!

51:19.760 --> 51:20.909
Watch the oil!

51:21.240 --> 51:23.595
Keep rowing if you want to live!

51:25.560 --> 51:27.835
- All hands on deck!
- Reverse!

51:28.240 --> 51:29.958
Keep rowing!

51:33.240 --> 51:34.468
Pull back!

51:34.560 --> 51:35.913
Heed my drum!

51:37.320 --> 51:39.595
Keep rowing if you want to live!

51:43.400 --> 51:44.628
Get away from me!

51:44.920 --> 51:46.056
All you Romans will die!

51:46.080 --> 51:47.080
Keep rowing!

51:47.160 --> 51:49.196
This is a Greek sea now!

51:51.080 --> 51:52.229
Reverse!

51:54.560 --> 51:55.629
Reverse!

52:00.400 --> 52:01.992
We need to keep moving.

52:02.840 --> 52:04.478
We need to keep moving!

52:05.000 --> 52:08.549
Everyone! Listen to me!
We need to keep moving!

52:08.800 --> 52:10.870
If we stay idle, we all die.

52:11.680 --> 52:12.999
Hands on oars!

52:13.400 --> 52:16.676
Hands on oars! On my count!

52:17.000 --> 52:19.992
And row!

52:20.760 --> 52:22.113
And...

52:22.600 --> 52:23.749
Row!

52:25.000 --> 52:26.274
Together...

52:26.880 --> 52:29.075
And row!

52:30.960 --> 52:32.313
And...

52:32.920 --> 52:33.920
Row!

52:35.640 --> 52:38.074
And row!

52:41.120 --> 52:43.156
And row!

52:43.240 --> 52:45.708
Battering ram
on the starboard side!

55:30.200 --> 55:31.519
Messala!

55:33.120 --> 55:35.680
Messala, a notice has come
from the lonian Sea.

55:35.760 --> 55:37.557
The Astroea was lost in battle.

55:37.640 --> 55:39.358
Greek rebels ambushed our ships.

55:40.560 --> 55:41.595
Any survivors?

55:41.680 --> 55:43.398
The entire third fleet is lost.

55:43.640 --> 55:45.358
All are dead to the last man.

55:45.440 --> 55:47.351
Caesar demands that we retaliate.

58:18.080 --> 58:20.469
How long were you
a galley slave?

58:34.360 --> 58:36.078
One never knows.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.356
Dangerous territory.
Pirates and marauders.

58:41.480 --> 58:42.515
And which are you?

58:43.200 --> 58:45.270
The one not in chains.

58:47.400 --> 58:51.916
You wash ashore shackled,
your back striped.

58:52.560 --> 58:55.028
You were a galley slave. How long?

58:56.480 --> 58:57.879
Five years.

58:58.320 --> 58:59.992
What were you accused of?

59:00.680 --> 59:03.069
- I committed no crime.
- And I lay no blame.

59:03.160 --> 59:05.993
I asked what you were accused of.

59:07.400 --> 59:08.719
Sedition.

59:09.080 --> 59:11.150
That's a serious charge.

59:11.920 --> 59:13.560
I'll have to turn you over to the Romans.

59:13.600 --> 59:14.999
No. No.

59:15.080 --> 59:17.833
You are an escaped prisoner.

59:17.920 --> 59:20.036
To do otherwise would put
my camp in jeopardy.

59:20.280 --> 59:21.713
They'll kill me.

59:22.680 --> 59:24.352
I'm sure they will.

59:25.920 --> 59:28.070
We will discharge him
outside the garrison

59:28.160 --> 59:29.388
before we leave for Jerusalem.

59:29.480 --> 59:31.118
Jerusalem.

59:31.200 --> 59:32.952
That's where I'm from.

59:33.360 --> 59:34.998
I have family there.

59:35.080 --> 59:37.833
Your private affairs
are no concern of mine.

59:41.320 --> 59:43.436
You race chariots?

59:43.520 --> 59:45.954
Young men race chariots.

59:46.040 --> 59:49.555
Old men wager on young men
who race chariots.

59:49.880 --> 59:52.792
How will you race
with only three horses?

59:54.960 --> 59:56.916
Aliyah is sick, but that's my dilemma.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.956
No. She's dying.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.432
I can help her.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.798
I know horses.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.192
I've seen it before. It's called farcy.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.075
It can be treated with charcoal.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.513
I can help her.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.835
All I ask in return,

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.558
take me with you.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.992
Let me find my family.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.960
Or at least let me find out
what happened to them.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.272
What is your name?

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.749
Judah.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.273
Judah Ben-Hur.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.513
The bargain is this, Judah Ben-Hur.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.195
You owe me your life.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.560
I expect that bill to be paid.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.079
Release him.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.632
Kill the leper!

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.073
Look at yourself!

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.313
Kill the leper!

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.038
Don't! Please don't!

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.356
- This man is your neighbor.
- Wait!

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.397
- The Torah tells us to...
- Wait! Stop!

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.550
Love your neighbor
as we love ourselves.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.916
Wait. Stop! Stop!

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.353
Stop. Stop.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.670
Hate, anger, fear.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.399
Those are lies they
use to turn you against each other.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.716
When you set aside the hate
they force you to carry,

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.072
that's when you know

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.556
love is our true nature.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.470
Do you see what's
happening here?

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.795
Mark my words, Messala,
this is the poison.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:31.348
But that man offers
the people something more,

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.829
and calms them with compassion.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.990
This Jesus of Nazareth

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.277
is more dangerous
than all of the Zealots combined.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.396
Wake up. Come on.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.630
Up we go, come on. Up. Up.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.038
Up we go. Good girl.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.196
Up we go. Come on. Come on.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.309
Ilderim.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.553
Good girl. Good girl.

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.677
Good girl. Here we are.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.759
Here we are.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.833
Good girl.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.675
She looks well.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.318
No, not yet.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.789
She is taking the charcoal, though.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.552
Very nice.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.828
Aliyah.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.359
I had one just like her.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.316
- Did you now?
- Yes.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.988
So you do know something about horses.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:33.840
Thank you,

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.513
Judah Ben-Hur.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.560
They're harnessed wrong.
Aliyah should be here.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:00.720
Kadeem?

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.952
Mind your business.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.640
Listen to me.
If you take them into a gallop...

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.792
Judah.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.598
They're going to bolt.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.949
The horses! Get the horses!

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.800
Stop those horses!

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.560
- Stay away! Stay away!
- Hold it! Hold it!

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.988
Ilderim, be careful.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.672
Ilderim, move out of the way!

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.233
Whoa, now! Whoa!

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.795
Get out of the way!

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.600
Kadeem!

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.189
Aliyah!

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.430
Stop! Stop! Stop her!

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.512
- Kadeem!
- Hold it! Hold it!

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.673
- Aliyah!
- Judah, no!

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.034
Aliyah... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.639
No, Judah!

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.120
Hang on!

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.718
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Aliyah.

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.308
Here, take the reins.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.308
Is she hurt?

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.436
Oh. Oh, Aliyah. Shh.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.555
It's all right.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.432
- You're fine.
- Easy, girl. Easy.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.040
- Easy, girl. Shh.
- How did you know?

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.830
I told him Aliyah should be on the inside.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.396
She hasn't run in a while.
She couldn't keep the pace.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.148
When she broke stride,
she incited the others.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:34.640
Kadeem.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:35.680
How's he?

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.439
Not good.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.835
How is it you weren't put
directly to the sword?

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.471
I was born to station.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.752
A rich Jew sentenced to a slow death.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.390
I imagine there were many in Rome who
found that very entertaining.

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:09.789
Was there ever a kind
more obsessed with the obscene?

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:14.556
People starve, the masses are enslaved,

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:19.311
and Caesar answers with
less bread and more circuses.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.517
But I can't complain.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:26.391
Their excessive nature lines my purses.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.875
Is that why you're going to Jerusalem?

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.994
There'll be opportunities to race.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.278
The Prefect is celebrating
himself with a tremendous circus

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.715
and his champion, Messala.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.349
Messala Severus?

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.936
- I hope this keeps you warm.
- Thank you.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.598
My love to your family.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.354
- Thank you.
- God bless you.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.228
Esther.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:27.951
Good to see you, Simon. God bless you.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.278
Esther, what is it?

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:06.799
My husband.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.158
Oh, I've missed you.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.951
I've missed you so much.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.874
Oh, Judah.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.477
Judah. Judah.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:28.915
Judah.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.791
I shouldn't have run.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.791
They would have killed you, too.

01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:46.430
I would have died with my family.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.511
That's better than
being alone with my guilt.

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.554
I've filled my life in other ways.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.158
By serving others?

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.158
I've found people to care for.
People who care for me.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.670
When I can, I spread the Word.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:05.957
The message of Jesus.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.631
That carpenter, he showed you kindness

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.198
when no one else would.

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:13.352
I've seen him do acts of grace so small,

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:14.960
but so much more than other people do.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.359
Every day for five years
I asked myself the same questions.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.511
What happened to you?

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.679
What happened
to my mother and sister?

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.439
Were they crucified?

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.837
Where are they buried?

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.479
I don't know.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.872
Someone must know.

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:55.474
Messala.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.516
He's become the pride of Roman Judea.

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.000
He's the commander of the garrison,

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.310
races chariots in Caesar's name.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.400
You couldn't go near him.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.272
You won't go near him.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.875
Get up.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.976
You can't stay in Jerusalem.
This isn't the place...

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.696
No, no, no, I'm safe. I'm staying
in a cabin outside the garden gate.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.029
I will find
a way for us if that's what you still want.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.318
Wait to hear from me.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.320
Judah?

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.992
So, charlatans,
religious indoctrinators,

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.554
holy men.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.631
We will work with local people.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.756
We will make arrests.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.278
Anyone who doesn't get the message,

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.112
we'll find an answer for.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.200
What's this?

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.511
A gift brought by a messenger
with an invitation to meet.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:49.068
- Meet where?
- He said you would know.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.550
Have no fear of the Zealots.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.755
They fight, they disrupt.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.630
I haven't changed that much,
have I, brother?

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.313
What do you want?

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.872
Where is my mother and sister?

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.999
They're dead.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.317
It was a quick death?

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.357
Where are they buried?

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:54.195
You forced my hand, Judah.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.995
You chose the Zealots over me.

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.991
Listen, Judah, your pride...

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.593
Onwards! Quickly!

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.120
Surround this house!

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:03.640
Walk through the portal!

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.720
Coward.

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.793
Catch him! Do not let him escape!

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:04.600
Esther.

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.750
Faith brought you back to me.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.434
The same faith that kept you alive.

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.792
That wasn't faith.

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.476
Faith wasn't strong enough.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:38.079
That was hate.

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.278
I became hate.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.716
That's what kept me alive.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.911
Let Messala go.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:56.715
Don't you see
we've been given a second chance?

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.875
Spend it on hatred,
then you're still a slave.

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.557
What else do I have?

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.759
Me.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.718
You have me.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.831
Messala was down
when we entered.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.515
There was at least one man.
He escaped over this balcony.

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.031
Were they Zealots?

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.997
I don't know, Prefect.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.711
And at the house of Hur.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.872
You were in uniform.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.031
An attack on you is an attack on Rome.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.396
An example needs to be made.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:01.960
What's the value of a Jew to a Roman?

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.109
Ten to one.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.429
Twenty, I would say.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.830
Pull twenty Jews from the streets.

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.314
Execute them
in the name of the Emperor.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.635
And let the people know, Messala,

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.271
the days of forgiveness are behind them.

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.278
Five, six, seven, eight, nine,

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.789
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16...

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.096
What are doing?
We've done nothing!

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.416
- Marcus!
- 17, 18, 19.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.078
I have two!

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:44.237
We have 19! Take one, leave the other!

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.315
Judah!

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.798
Have you been to the hillside?

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.600
Have you seen the twenty
they've crucified?

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.114
What twenty?

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:01.158
There's talk. A Roman
attacked at the house of Hur.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:02.909
You did that.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.400
If people are dead, that's on Rome.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.754
You tried to kill Messala.

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:08.793
I told you to stay away from him, Judah.
I warned you!

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.873
I won't let him
go unpunished for what he's done to us.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:12.995
I can't.

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:15.275
I watched my father be killed.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.000
I know what it's like to
want to take your feelings out on others.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:21.591
They deserve justice
for what's happened to them.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.550
There's nothing here for you anymore.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:28.834
Nothing.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.190
Know the world you live in, Judah.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.516
The world you live in is Rome's.

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.435
Their laws.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.873
Their power.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.999
You cannot fight them in the streets.

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.192
But there is another way.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.313
The circus.

01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.480
In the circus,

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.078
there is no law.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.275
There is no right,

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.759
no wrong.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.879
What happens there is sport,

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.154
not vengeance.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.598
Do as you please.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.956
Give them a show,
the people will cheer you.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.430
How pathetic it must be
when your sole motivator is greed.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:25.436
You feed my beauties.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.876
Don't think you know me.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.308
Five years in the gut of a slave ship.

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.231
I know what motivates.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:35.795
Five years of pain
after twenty of privilege,

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:39.236
and now you think you know
something about suffering.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.068
Your situation is not unique, Judah.

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.838
Neither are you.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.639
My son spoke up for liberation.

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.792
He was branded a rebel.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:56.718
Dragged through the streets,
his throat slit like a hog.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.796
I traveled my
"all Romans must die" phase,

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:05.108
same as you.

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.430
All Romans won't die.

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.078
They can't die.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.268
You can't kill them quickly enough.

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.076
If Messala is the pride of Rome,

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.798
take their pride.

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.831
Beat him in their circus.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:28.034
Give them a shame they will understand.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.552
I was accused.

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.472
I'm meant to be dead.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.473
They won't let me race.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.797
They're Romans, Judah.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:43.631
For the right price,
they'll let you do anything.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:14.118
I bring greetings
and congratulations

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.111
on the opening of your games, Prefect.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.035
This is a private gathering,
old man. Move on.

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.671
I'm not here to cause trouble.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.834
Same as you, I'm here
for the love of sport.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.791
So, where do I have to go to make a bet?

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.195
What's the wager?

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.319
My chariot.

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.876
The entries are long closed.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.790
Three thousand gold pieces.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.230
That enough to make you reconsider?

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:49.153
If that's not enough, how about this?

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.833
I'll give 3-to-1 odds on all bets.

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:57.472
My book is open.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.516
That's very generous
against a strong field.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.756
I'm not betting the field.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:07.434
I'm betting that my driver
will be victorious over

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:08.589
Messala.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.635
A bet like that's not customary.

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.352
And it's not appropriate.

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.919
Not appropriate for who?

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:19.712
All of those citizens who stand to
gain when you beat my man?

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.590
You will beat him, won't you?

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.398
He's just a Jew.

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.680
Oh, I'm sorry. I failed to mention that.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.469
But you've crushed an entire people.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:33.950
I should think
crushing one man wouldn't be difficult.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.350
You're on soft ground.

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:38.113
My money

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.911
against your pride.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.433
Seems even.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:49.472
3-to-1 not enough? How about 6-to-1?

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.199
With the agreement

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:56.230
that should my driver cross the line first,

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:00.472
any and all claims against him are quit.

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:04.513
Any, and all.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.309
Good.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.276
I will leave this with you

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.918
until the race is settled.

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.470
African! What's the name of the driver?

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:23.872
You know his name.

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:29.640
Judah!

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:31.631
Shorten those reins!

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:34.393
Go, go, go!

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.308
Go!

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.108
Step forward!

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:48.879
Good. Steady.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.149
Okay.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.469
Okay.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.079
Good. It will get better.

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.633
I couldn't see anything.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.160
In the circus,

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.476
be aware of the drivers' tricks.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:07.074
Two riders part,
suck you in between them,

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.957
and crush you under their wheels.

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.075
It's called the "gate."

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.957
I just need to get to Messala.

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:15.191
Well, you think they're just
gonna give it to you?

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.716
No. The circus is a blood sport,

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.994
but it is sport.

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.753
There is strategy,
and you have to know it.

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.389
Good?

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.800
Esther.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.376
Esther, I need to ask something of you.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.958
There's nothing to speak of.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.712
I'm going to race Messala in the circus.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.871
It's the only way to end this.

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:41.360
Please.

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.159
You always cared deeply for my family.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.078
If you ever find their graves,

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:50.597
bury us together, put us all to rest.

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:52.956
Judah, you can't give up hope.

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:55.235
You must believe there's a better way.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.593
There's not.

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.592
Messala rides like the devil.

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.910
He will do whatever he must to win.

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.268
Now, when you cut first,
they'll tend to put you up on one wheel.

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.635
So, you have to learn how to tilt.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:26.551
It's all about balance, Judah.

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:28.915
It's a dangerous maneuver, of course,

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.759
but with courage and practice,
it can be mastered.

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.995
This is the spina.

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.518
This is where I'll be.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.192
And I will try to guide you.

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.752
Now, when the race begins,
do not try to take the lead.

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:50.234
Lay back.
Let the other drivers fight for position.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.536
- And the best strategy...
- But if I'm in the back,

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:54.152
how do I get to him?

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.798
The race will bring him to you.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.756
With each successive lap,

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:02.480
there will be fewer and fewer chariots.

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:06.157
Which is why it's important
for you to stay back.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:10.151
And remember, Judah, first to finish,

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.952
last to die.

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:22.475
Messala.

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.034
She wants you.

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.233
Messala! Messala!

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.320
Calm down.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:38.398
Messala! Messala! Messala!

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.910
Messala! Messala!

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:47.634
You can't race him.

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.679
There's no stopping it.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.474
I'm asking you to remember
that Judah is your brother.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:55.752
The Hurs are your family.

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.273
My past is lost to me.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.390
Each one of us has a choice.

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.237
You and Judah can make things right.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:06.874
How?

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.188
Disqualify him,

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.032
or, disqualify yourself.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:13.879
And be branded as a coward?
I'll die first.

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:17.039
Yes, one of you will die.

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.395
There is no victory in this.

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.911
Oh, so, you've come
to ask for my public humiliation.

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.398
No, Messala.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:30.234
I've come to tell you
of the hell you'll unleash.

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:35.554
God punishes just as God forgives.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.636
We have different gods.

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:40.720
Marcus!

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.353
She's asking for too much.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.469
Judah.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.034
Get up.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.228
You recognize him?

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:14.720
No.

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:15.875
Then he's a thief.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.672
Take him, and give him a thief's reward.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.876
No, Judah Ben-Hur.

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:23.599
You don't remember.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.991
I remember you.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.275
You never forget a man
who's held a knife to your throat.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.634
I'll kill him!

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:31.755
I'll kill him! I swear!

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:35.030
Drusus. What's happened to you?

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.236
I know where your family is.

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.149
- My family are dead.
- No, they're not.

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.355
He's lying.

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.670
Rome doesn't keep prisoners,
it executes them.

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.474
Pilate ordered your family to be crucified,

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.640
but I had them intercepted.

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.315
Sent to the caves at Timnath-Serah.

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.153
Please, pay me,

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:54.829
and I can take you to your family.

01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.354
I have to go with him.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.438
Ilderim, you must allow me this.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.715
I beg you. If there's even
a chance they're alive...

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.114
They are.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Let him up.

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:24.278
Prepare a horse for him.

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.715
I'll be back, I swear.

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:35.791
- Take this.
- What for?

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:38.235
He's a Roman.
That's all the reason you need.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.789
Why would you save them?

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.395
I did it for Messala.
He cherished your sister.

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.152
If he wouldn't save her himself,

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.435
then I would save him
from his own mistake.

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:28.320
Judah, please, wait.

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.594
Mother?

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.916
Oh, my God, you're alive.

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.636
Mother, it's me. It's Judah.

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:01.393
It's Judah.

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:05.348
Judah?

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.119
It's Judah.

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:09.680
It's your son.

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.631
I miss my boy.

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:27.109
- Mother, I'm here.
- No.

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:30.475
He's outside playing in the sun.

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:33.315
No, I'm Judah. I'm Judah.

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.233
You can't help us.

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:39.319
Tirzah, what's happened?

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.311
If you love us, forget about us.

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.400
What's happened?

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:43.856
- You are not my boy!
- Mother, what's wrong?

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:44.880
We're lepers. Get out.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.840
- We're unclean, Judah!
- We're lepers!

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:48.136
- Get him out now!
- We're lepers!

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:50.216
- Get him out! Get him out!
- Judah, get out!

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:51.514
- Go away!
- Get him out!

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.953
You go away!

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.152
Gesius, they are dying. Let us take them.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.991
- They have leprosy.
- Judah, please.

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.231
I did what I could. It's better this way...

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:03.878
I'll be back for them.

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.896
They're lepers,
they'd be stoned in the street!

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:07.194
I will be back for you!

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:11.231
Judah, I tried.
I saved them. I saved them!

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.429
You didn't save them!

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:14.829
You condemned them
to a life worse than death.

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.878
A life worse than death!

01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:20.390
He'll pay for what he's done to us.

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.395
People of Jerusalem.

01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:06.076
Friends of Rome!

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:10.239
We celebrate the power of man!

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:13.159
You idiot!

01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.389
Get it now!

01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:16.277
Men gathered here today

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.594
hailing from Persia,

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:22.358
Greece,

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.998
Arabia,

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.079
Syria...

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.832
Ethiopia,

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.713
Egypt,

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.599
Judea.

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.435
And the unbeaten

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:45.919
Rome!

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.834
Going to run this. One time.

01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.831
Good girl. Good girl.

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:02.115
We pay tribute to Caesar

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:07.072
and give thanks for his
virtue and his mercy

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:10.716
in this circus.

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:14.634
A grand arena, ten years in the making.

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:17.510
You will have the pleasure...

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:20.068
for the first time in Judean history.

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:21.360
Ready?

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:23.351
Don't look so worried.

01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:26.148
This wise old man once told me,

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.800
"First to finish, last to die."

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.479
Good advice.

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.832
You will see them race for glory.

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:43.472
You will see them fight for honor.

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:45.915
You will see them die for you!

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.913
You should have stayed away.

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.792
You should have killed me.

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:16.028
I will.

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:40.589
Judah! Judah! Pull back! Pull back!

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:43.189
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:47.879
What is going on?

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.912
Enjoy this lap!

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:14.912
I'll kill you on the next one!

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:49.800
Get back!

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.909
My helmet.

01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.795
Hurry up!

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.551
The "gate," Judah! The "gate"!

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:41.679
Good move, Judah. Good move.

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:54.190
Another trick for you!

01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:14.634
Fetch him! Fetch him!

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.438
Move him! Come on, move him!

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:20.238
Quick, get him on the rack.

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.033
Hurry up! Hurry up!

01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:28.120
Come on! Come on.

01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.428
Stand back! Stand back!

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:31.033
Hurry up! Move!

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.270
- Out of the way!
- Back up!

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.588
Get us up there!

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:35.816
- Move!
- Get out of the way!

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:36.955
Hurry!

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.752
I'll kill you!

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.717
Are you not Roman?

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.711
Come on, Messala!

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:41.515
Horses!

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.588
Go, Aliyah!

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:23.795
Go, go!

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:26.872
Judah! Judah! Judah! Judah!

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:30.391
Judah! Judah! Judah!

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:31.709
Judah! Judah!

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.034
- No shame to be second!
- We're riding now!

01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.908
Come on! Come on!

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.069
Come on!

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:35.551
Are we having fun now, brother?

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:50.593
Messala!

01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.910
Judah! Judah! Judah!

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.797
And row!

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:12.600
Yes!

01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:14.435
Go!

01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:20.240
Move!

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:27.798
Shorten up your reins, Judah!

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:33.197
Judah! Judah! Judah!

01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.280
Come on, Judah.

01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:42.400
Kill him!

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:44.434
Messala, kill him!

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.319
Judah!

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.550
Judah! Judah! Judah!

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:37.993
Judah! Judah!

01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.271
Judah! Judah! Judah!

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.596
Wait. Wait!

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:38.192
Congratulations, African.

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:40.680
Take your winnings.

01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:42.992
Condolences on your loss.

01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:44.080
Loss?

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:47.393
Look at them.

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.592
They want blood.

01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:53.871
They're all Romans now.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.149
Judah?

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.359
What's wrong?

01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:58.391
You've won! You should be celebrating.

01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:02.836
Do you know what's ahead for us?

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:06.432
The riches we can make in Rome? Eh?

01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:10.430
Wandering around the desert
with nothing, for nothing.

01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:12.518
What kind of life is that?

01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:15.554
It's something other than loneliness.

01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:17.676
It's the only life I know.

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.510
Find something for yourself.

01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.640
Peter.

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:46.160
Jesus!

01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:47.595
Soldiers!

01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:54.110
- Jesus of Nazareth...
- Stop!

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:55.920
In the name of Caesar,
you are under arrest.

01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:59.914
Peter! Peter! No trouble.

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:02.111
Not from any of you.

01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:05.113
Those who live by the sword,
will die by the sword.

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:12.435
Jesus! Jesus!

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:15.836
Dear Lord, please help us!

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:17.717
He's our Savior! Please let him go!

01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:20.639
Please help!

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:23.158
Esther!

01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:24.514
Esther!

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.240
Esther!

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:29.754
You heard him, stand back!

01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:31.429
Esther?

01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:35.355
Esther? Esther?

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:42.998
Impostor!

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:45.275
Move!

01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:02.438
No water for him.

01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:05.313
No water for him!

01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:08.109
Drink. Please drink.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:10.238
No water for him!

01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:16.994
No, Judah.

01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:20.478
My life,

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:23.597
I give it of my own free will.

01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:47.640
Someone should help him.

01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:51.032
I thought you were
the son of God!

01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:57.554
Put him to death!

01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:00.359
You'll get what you deserve!

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:17.068
We deserve to die
for our crimes!

01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:20.119
But this man has done nothing wrong!

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:22.720
Jesus?

01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:26.712
Remember me when you come
into your kingdom.

01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:33.392
Today, you will be with me in paradise.

01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:43.199
Father,

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:45.359
forgive them,

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:48.754
for they know not what they do.

01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:04.229
It's

01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:07.040
finished.

01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:23.109
Come on.

01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:25.477
That's it! Come on!
Let's move out!

01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:37.760
Come on!

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:40.029
We're healed.

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:48.874
Judah...

01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:02.032
How could this be?

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:08.399
I will take them.

01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:13.040
Come.

01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:14.714
You are free.

01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:24.991
I lost him.

01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:26.479
I've lost my brother.

01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:28.232
No, you must have faith, Judah.

01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:11.953
I see you.

01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:17.835
Don't stand so far away. Come close.

01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:22.233
Come see what you did to me.

01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:25.711
I won't go that easy.

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:29.190
As long as I live, I'll claw at you.

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:31.794
And if I die, I'll drag you
beneath the ground beside me!

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:34.630
With the last of me,
I'll choke the life from you!

01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:35.720
No.

01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:37.320
I'll make myself whole again, I swear,

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.634
and when I do, I'll kill you!

01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:40.878
- No more killing.
- You did this to me!

01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:43.235
- No more slaughter.
- You did this!

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:49.790
Remember when we were young?

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.831
When I was hurt and you carried me

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:56.074
with all your strength
for as long as you could.

01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:58.836
I can't fight anymore.

01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:00.991
I can't hate anymore.

01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:06.159
All I can do is carry you.

01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:16.519
Oh, Judah, forgive me.

01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:18.958
No, forgive me.

01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:21.153
Forgive me.

01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:32.080
There were
many miracles that day,

01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:35.317
and in the days that followed.

01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:39.154
As time passed,

01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:43.708
forgiveness and understanding
had reunited the family.

01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:51.512
To give hope and promise
for a better way.

01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.630
To fight the good fight,

01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:55.720
to finish the race,

01:56:57.720 --> 01:56:59.676
to keep the faith.

01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:14.031
Don't look back, J udah.

01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:16.397
Your whole life is ahead of you.

01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:22.194
You ready, brother?

01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:23.912
Hmm?
