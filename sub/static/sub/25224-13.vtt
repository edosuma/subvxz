01:00.480 --> 01:03.600
So, Michael, let me ask you.
Why are you doing it now?

01:03.680 --> 01:06.880
If you're-- What-- I guess,
why would a person who's innocent...

01:07.560 --> 01:11.240
take a plea, even if it is an Alford plea?
And that's a long question.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.400
I'll give you a long answer. Uh...

01:14.480 --> 01:15.600
Deaver is gone,

01:16.960 --> 01:19.080
but that atmosphere, that culture

01:19.840 --> 01:24.800
of doing anything possible
to convict someone is still there.

01:24.880 --> 01:28.280
Fifteen years ago, I believed absolutely,
if the police arrested somebody,

01:28.760 --> 01:31.600
you know, a rich white guy,
that person must be guilty.

01:31.720 --> 01:35.400
If they shot somebody, always justified.
Nobody believes that anymore.

01:36.240 --> 01:40.720
We now know that the police
and district attorneys will do anything

01:41.160 --> 01:42.160
to convict a person.

01:42.240 --> 01:46.560
And once they've done that,
they are never going to back up.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.360
They lied once...

01:48.760 --> 01:49.800
"Let me try it again.

01:50.280 --> 01:53.640
Let me trust these people who put me away,
let me trust the SBI,

01:53.720 --> 01:57.520
let me trust the police law enforcement,
let me trust the DI."

01:57.800 --> 01:59.440
No, I'm not about to do that,

01:59.520 --> 02:02.560
because I don't believe
they would play fair.

02:02.840 --> 02:04.560
And then we find that

02:04.640 --> 02:09.039
Freda Black writes a note that says
Deborah Radisch, the medical examiner,

02:09.120 --> 02:13.960
told her that she did not
initially believe

02:14.040 --> 02:17.080
that it was blunt force trauma
that was the cause of death,

02:17.160 --> 02:19.360
but that she had to put that in there

02:19.440 --> 02:22.480
because John Butts, who was the chief
medical examiner at the time,

02:22.560 --> 02:23.960
told her to, in essence.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.760
So there's that note.

02:26.920 --> 02:33.000
And then we find a fax
from Candace Zamperini to Deborah Radisch,

02:33.080 --> 02:36.760
thanking her for explaining
why Michael was guilty.

02:36.840 --> 02:37.760
Mm-hmm.

02:37.840 --> 02:39.360
And you put all that together

02:39.440 --> 02:41.920
and I think the bottom line
from Michael was...

02:42.840 --> 02:47.040
he could not put his faith
in that system again.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.200
You know, he put his faith there once,

02:49.520 --> 02:51.720
and he was convicted
and spent eight years in prison.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.520
Hadn't it been for Greg Taylor,

02:55.760 --> 02:57.200
I'd probably still be in prison.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.760
Greg Taylor...

02:59.360 --> 03:00.400
Takayama test.

03:01.600 --> 03:06.040
Right. When it finally came out
that Duane Deaver had falsified

03:06.120 --> 03:08.080
or withheld evidence, whatever,

03:09.680 --> 03:10.840
then it turned to me.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.320
And in my-- And in my case,

03:13.400 --> 03:18.520
he didn't withhold evidence
like he did in Greg Taylor's case.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.560
He invented evidence.

03:20.880 --> 03:25.800
What role do you think bisexuality and
the testimony about Elizabeth Ratliff--

03:25.880 --> 03:30.760
Oh, just more mud, sure!
Anything, just throw that up. Uh...

03:31.680 --> 03:35.400
I think the bisexuality probably,
whether anybody wanted to admit it--

03:35.480 --> 03:40.760
Well, my God, there's Freda Black,
"Pure-T filth!" screaming about it.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.160
Of course that had to have an impact.

03:44.480 --> 03:48.360
Why does that translate into murder?
I mean, that makes no sense at all.

03:48.760 --> 03:49.800
But it certainly would...

03:49.880 --> 03:52.920
"Oh! Oh, my God."
There it is in the juror's head.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.920
I think one of the reasons
they were able to get in the bisexuality

03:56.000 --> 04:00.320
is because of the description
of the idyllic marriage.

04:00.800 --> 04:05.160
- Do you regret saying that?
- That was the truth!

04:05.600 --> 04:12.160
They-- They had the kind of marriage
that everybody wants to have.

04:12.560 --> 04:17.360
We interviewed dozens of their friends.
Dozens!

04:17.959 --> 04:20.720
And every one of them said the same thing.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.600
"They got along great.
They never argued."

04:24.960 --> 04:27.040
"They were like two peas in a pod."

04:27.800 --> 04:34.720
I mean, couple after couple after couple
after couple said the same things.

04:35.040 --> 04:38.680
Okay, I have friends
who would disagree

04:38.760 --> 04:40.800
that you have the idyllic marriage

04:40.880 --> 04:42.520
- if one of the partners...
- Sure.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.720
...wants to have relationships,
or whatever word you choose to use,

04:45.800 --> 04:47.880
'cause I know you have problems
with the words

04:47.960 --> 04:50.640
"relationships" and "affairs,"
outside the marriage.

04:50.720 --> 04:51.920
- Regardless...
- I understand.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
...of the sex of the other person, right?

04:54.080 --> 04:56.480
Your wife knew about those things
and was comfortable?

04:56.560 --> 04:59.520
- I think she was comfortable with it.
- Mm-hmm.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.680
Yeah, absolutely.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.400
- Did y'all talk about it?
- Not really.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.760
Not really.
It was sort of...

05:09.960 --> 05:11.680
in an oblique type of way.

05:40.520 --> 05:45.760
We had just this closeness.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.960
She'd come home
and I could hear her footsteps.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.880
Knowing where she's going.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.920
She's going to the refrigerator
to get a drink, or get some wine.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.200
I can hear her all the time.
I-- I can. I can.

06:01.120 --> 06:01.960
I, uh...

06:03.160 --> 06:04.440
I think about her all the time.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.440
All the time, as I know Candace does
and I know Lori does.

06:08.520 --> 06:12.840
As Margaret and Martha do--
As... as we do, you see?

06:14.040 --> 06:18.720
You know, everybody keeps talking,
"Oh, Kathleen's lost in this tragedy."

06:19.400 --> 06:20.600
No, she is not!

06:21.880 --> 06:23.880
We all think of her all the time.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.880
She's as alive...

06:26.600 --> 06:27.520
We all think about her.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.800
She's...

06:35.200 --> 06:36.200
just part of us.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.200
God!

06:52.880 --> 06:53.720
Mm.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.440
And I told you that.
That would have been...

07:13.040 --> 07:17.240
fun, almost, to discuss that,
my sexuality.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.720
And I wonder, "What would she have said?"

07:22.800 --> 07:24.720
Right? I don't know.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.560
I don't know. She would have...

07:28.920 --> 07:30.360
She would have made it right.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.800
I was lying about certain things.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.720
I had to. I mean it was part of who I...

08:25.320 --> 08:28.640
was trying not to reveal.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.920
Well, you get to a certain point.
"Well, what's the point?"

08:32.080 --> 08:34.200
Come on. You know, let's be honest here.

08:34.720 --> 08:38.840
And it was the short stop
on my baseball team.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.200
I used to play baseball. I was catcher,
sometimes I was the pitcher,

08:43.440 --> 08:44.400
And I was...

08:45.840 --> 08:46.920
you know, really confused.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.600
You know, what's...
what's this all about?

08:49.680 --> 08:56.160
I had never, before that time,
ever had a male-male thought

08:56.240 --> 08:58.200
as far as I realized. Never did.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.000
And then suddenly he was there

09:00.520 --> 09:05.760
in that fantasy along with Melanie.

09:07.600 --> 09:11.920
And I was very confused by that,

09:12.840 --> 09:16.400
but it didn't take me--
But it didn't go away from my fantasies.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.200
We played on the ball team
and, you know...

09:19.640 --> 09:21.960
And I realized at that time

09:22.600 --> 09:27.600
I had felt a great attraction for females,
but for guys also.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.120
It was just there.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.480
Where did it come from?
I have no idea.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.920
Well, my God, this was 1954, 1955.

09:38.440 --> 09:42.240
60 years ago.
That was not going to happen.

09:42.760 --> 09:46.160
Certainly not on a military base,
you know, athletics.

09:46.440 --> 09:49.800
It just didn't--
It was not a possibility.

10:22.880 --> 10:27.760
I wasn't brave enough to say,
"Oh, fuck you! This is how I am."

10:28.040 --> 10:32.360
You didn't do that in 1950s, uh...

10:33.440 --> 10:34.280
America.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.360
They finally evolved
to "Don't ask, don't tell."

10:38.000 --> 10:41.800
But when I was growing up,
it was a simple matter of "Don't!"

10:43.520 --> 10:47.080
And I lived by that rule.

10:48.720 --> 10:52.960
And so it was just suppressed there.

10:53.040 --> 10:56.880
Never went away and never...

10:57.920 --> 11:01.160
As I got older,
it never was a matter of,

11:01.440 --> 11:04.320
"Oh, I'm going to go to hell.
It's awful, it's terrible."

11:05.240 --> 11:08.040
It's mostly terrible
in the eyes of other people.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.440
It's terrible in the eyes of society.

11:10.520 --> 11:15.040
It's terrible how people would view me,
not how I really felt.

11:15.440 --> 11:19.520
So I really gave into this,
let's say, peer pressure.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.920
I didn't think God was gonna punish me.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.840
Well, I've given up that thought
a long time ago.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.120
It was just something that I had...

11:30.040 --> 11:33.280
hidden, and it stayed hidden.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.320
That's all.

11:35.400 --> 11:42.280
In the beginning, from guilt, and then
just because it was a part of my life.

12:03.640 --> 12:08.080
I had suppressed it
and kept it hidden for so long

12:08.960 --> 12:12.240
that it was just a pattern of my life.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.000
Could I have fallen in love with a guy
had I opened myself up to that?

12:17.680 --> 12:23.400
I think now, no, but I...
It's possible.

12:24.600 --> 12:28.320
But my life would have been
completely different.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.160
I would have certainly never been
in the Marines,

12:31.240 --> 12:32.880
never would have written
the books I wrote.

12:32.960 --> 12:37.080
Never would have had my sons.
Uh...

12:39.040 --> 12:42.440
It would have just been
a completely different life,

12:42.920 --> 12:44.840
one I cannot even imagine.

12:45.960 --> 12:46.800
I don't know.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.320
I have never talked to a soul about it.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.480
This is the first time I've ever
even remotely touched on it.

13:15.960 --> 13:16.800
Uh...

13:18.320 --> 13:19.320
and it's okay.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.920
It takes you a long time
to get to that point.

13:23.000 --> 13:23.920
That's who I am.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.880
But when you live that so long--
"Oh, this is who I am."

13:30.200 --> 13:33.560
To make that leap is very difficult.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.320
And I didn't make that leap with Kathleen.
Yeah, it would have been better.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.520
I probably wasn't
that comfortable with it.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.760
I couldn't have been that comfortable
with it because I was hiding it.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.160
No getting around that one.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.840
And I'm sure that I felt guilty, uh...

13:52.600 --> 13:53.440
But...

13:55.000 --> 13:56.640
it's like when you get away
with something,

13:56.720 --> 13:59.960
you keep getting away with it,
and then it becomes, "Oh, it's all right."

14:01.160 --> 14:02.000
You see.

14:38.760 --> 14:39.880
Going up.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.560
Good morning.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.600
- How you feeling today?
- Good. Good.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.280
Okay, I got that.
All right.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.280
Oh, good.
I get to go in.

15:39.000 --> 15:39.840
Perfect.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.400
Good morning, Michael.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.600
- Did you see Candace?
- No.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.400
- Oh, my God.
- What's she doing?

15:59.480 --> 16:01.320
Oh, she insulted my suit.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.120
- She told me--
- Should have worn that dress.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.120
She told me to get a new suit
because I look poor.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.040
Oh, my God.

16:10.320 --> 16:14.120
And she said, she started,
"Oh, pleading guilty."

16:14.200 --> 16:16.440
I said, "No.
Actually, we're not pleading guilty."

16:16.520 --> 16:18.680
"Alford schmal-ford."

16:18.760 --> 16:19.960
God, that woman.

16:21.080 --> 16:25.320
What I found out today from Tommy and Stu
is that in June of 2002,

16:25.400 --> 16:27.320
- when they searched your house...
- Right.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.720
- ...they went down to the boiler room...
- Right.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.760
...and they found the blow poke.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.800
- Which they thought was a coat hanger.
- Hold on.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.000
- It gets better.
- Oh.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.600
They took it outside.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.720
Campen and Dan George were there.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.480
- They photographed it...
- Oh, my God.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.480
...with one of them holding it.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.360
- We never got that photograph.
- Is it too late to change all of this?

16:53.440 --> 16:56.640
Come on. Oh, Christ.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.960
They photographed it
and it was Campen and George.

17:00.320 --> 17:05.079
So, they knew back in June of 2002

17:06.319 --> 17:09.880
that this whole blow poke theory
was bullshit.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.800
And they got on the witness stand.

17:14.680 --> 17:18.400
And that picture never got... given to us.
Never.

17:19.359 --> 17:22.160
Well, is it possible to retrieve it now?

17:22.640 --> 17:24.079
- The photo?
- Yeah.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.520
- Oh, I'm sure it's gone.
- I'm sure that's gone. All right.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.600
-
-

18:42.880 --> 18:44.000
How are you doing?

18:44.640 --> 18:45.480
So...

18:48.000 --> 18:48.840
Listen.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.080
He's gonna read this.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.960
"Do you understand you are pleading guilty
pursuant to Alford?"

18:56.200 --> 18:59.000
- guilty pursuant to Alford.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.160
"Are you going to plead guilty
pursuant to Alford?"

19:05.360 --> 19:06.200
That was the deal.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.880
"Defendant pleads guilty
pursuant to Alford."

19:16.400 --> 19:20.000
Now I can get the three?
And take them back?

19:20.080 --> 19:24.000
Yeah. Yeah, we'll come back.
I wanna show him these.

19:24.560 --> 19:27.280
"You understand that filing a plea
of guilty pursuant to Alford--"

19:27.360 --> 19:30.720
- OK, I can see that.
- And you understand that may impact...

19:30.800 --> 19:32.400
- Okay, I agree.
- Okay.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.880
- I'll go make copies.
- Okay. Thank you very much.

19:35.960 --> 19:36.920
Oyez, oyez.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.040
The Superior Court of of Durham
now sitting for the dispatch of business.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.520
Honorable Judge Orlando F. Hudson, Jr.
presiding.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.680
God save the state and court.
You may be seated.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.720
- Good morning, Your Honor.
- Good morning.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.680
Your Honor, at this time, we're here
to address how Mr. Peterson pleads

19:53.760 --> 19:55.400
to the charge of voluntary manslaughter.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.360
All right.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.400
All right, Miss Clerk,
you can swear the defendant.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.000
Do you solemnly swear
the answers to questions

20:15.080 --> 20:17.080
that the court shall ask you
are true and accurate

20:17.160 --> 20:19.280
to the valid of your knowledge,
so help you God?

20:19.600 --> 20:21.240
- I do.
- Be seated.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.200
Mr. DA, is there a factual basis
from the state?

20:24.280 --> 20:27.000
Yes, Your Honor.
In December 9, 2001,

20:27.160 --> 20:30.560
911 received a call at approximately
2:40 am from the defendant

20:30.960 --> 20:35.840
indicating the condition of his wife
at their Cedar Street address

20:35.920 --> 20:37.440
here on Durham, North Carolina.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.440
Within seven to eight minutes,
paramedics had arrived.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.280
At that time, his son Todd
was just arriving as well.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.240
Upon entry,
they viewed Kathleen Peterson.

20:46.320 --> 20:49.760
She was prone on the floor
near the bottom of the staircase.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.240
There was a significant amount
of what appeared to be blood

20:52.320 --> 20:53.560
about her person.

20:53.640 --> 20:56.440
There was no pulse,
nor was she breathing at that time.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.640
And some of the blood
had already started to clot

20:59.720 --> 21:01.520
and was dried around her person.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.880
There's no evidence
that there was any other individuals

21:03.960 --> 21:06.360
present within the household
in the time frame

21:06.440 --> 21:08.320
the defendant was present
as well as his wife,

21:08.400 --> 21:11.360
suffered of injuries
that resulted in her death.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Kathleen Peterson was examined
by Dr. Radisch

21:14.080 --> 21:16.280
with the medical examiner's office
and autopsy.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.760
The autopsy indicated that
there were seven lacerations to the head.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.040
There was also injury to the neck,

21:22.120 --> 21:24.560
which was a fracture
with associated hemorrhage

21:24.640 --> 21:27.480
of the superior cornu
of the left thyroid cartilage.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.520
Dr. Radisch did indicate that her opinion
that the injury to the neck

21:31.600 --> 21:33.480
was consistent with strangulation

21:33.720 --> 21:36.080
and also that the injuries
were not consistent

21:36.160 --> 21:38.640
with a fall, but rather with a beating.

21:38.840 --> 21:42.240
Anything else
to the factual basis from the defense?

21:42.320 --> 21:43.320
Yes, sir, Your Honor.

21:44.080 --> 21:47.120
Your Honor,
you sat through a four-month trial

21:47.640 --> 21:52.840
at which we disputed
every single one of the facts

21:52.920 --> 21:55.680
that Mr. Dornfried just articulated.

21:56.160 --> 22:00.120
And this court has already found
that Mr. Deaver committed perjury

22:00.640 --> 22:02.320
at Mr. Peterson's trial.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.600
As for Deborah Radisch,

22:05.120 --> 22:08.320
we found a note
within the last two months,

22:09.040 --> 22:12.200
which indicated
that contrary to her testimony,

22:12.280 --> 22:15.640
which indicated that the cause of death
was blunt force trauma...

22:16.080 --> 22:20.120
In fact, she believed the cause of death
was the loss of blood,

22:20.200 --> 22:24.440
which is exactly what we posited
as the cause of death,

22:24.520 --> 22:26.560
although that's not what she testified to.

22:26.640 --> 22:31.440
Finally, with regard to her testimony
about blows to the head,

22:31.520 --> 22:35.120
she held up a blow poke,
she was shown a blow poke.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.360
And she testified,

22:36.440 --> 22:40.880
"Oh, yes, this is consistent
with the injuries that we saw."

22:41.760 --> 22:44.080
Of course thereafter,
as Your Honor well knows,

22:44.760 --> 22:49.200
that blow poke was found
in the garage of Mr. Peterson's house.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.120
Your Honor, I was actually present
when it was found

22:52.200 --> 22:54.160
and photographed with cobwebs,

22:54.480 --> 22:57.360
and it was subsequently introduced
into evidence.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.960
I found out in the last two days

23:00.360 --> 23:04.560
that, in fact, that blow poke
had been found by the police

23:05.000 --> 23:07.200
in June of 2002,

23:07.320 --> 23:10.200
before Miss Zamperini came in
with her theory

23:10.280 --> 23:12.120
that the blow poke was the murder weapon.

23:12.720 --> 23:16.800
And in fact, they took it out,

23:17.600 --> 23:20.640
photographed it
with Dan George and Eric Campen,

23:20.720 --> 23:22.520
the two crime scene techs,

23:23.120 --> 23:25.560
and then put it back
not where they had gotten it,

23:25.760 --> 23:29.640
but rather where we found it a year later
with cobwebs.

23:30.120 --> 23:35.800
Dan George and Eric Campen
both testified at Mr. Peterson's trial.

23:36.400 --> 23:40.240
They never said a word,
although they obviously knew

23:40.320 --> 23:42.440
what the prosecution's theory was.

23:43.240 --> 23:47.680
That they had found that blow poke
a year and a half earlier.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.320
Mr. Peterson is not guilty.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.240
He never was guilty.

23:52.600 --> 23:55.560
He's not admitting
that he was guilty in this.

23:55.920 --> 23:59.920
He is entering this plea because based on
all of those circumstances,

24:00.000 --> 24:03.960
including Mr. Deaver's
being all over the scene of the house,

24:04.080 --> 24:07.560
he does not feel, number one,
that he got a fair trial,

24:07.640 --> 24:09.000
based not on Your Honor's rulings,

24:09.080 --> 24:12.680
but on the conduct
of the law enforcement officers involved,

24:12.760 --> 24:15.360
and he is simply not willing to play again

24:15.440 --> 24:19.680
at what he perceives to be
an unfair or crooked table.

24:20.160 --> 24:24.000
So he's entering this plea
not based on any of the evidence

24:24.120 --> 24:26.640
that Mr. Dornfried has just articulated.

24:27.040 --> 24:30.520
He is entering this plea
because it's 15 years.

24:30.960 --> 24:34.000
He served eight years
for a crime he did not commit.

24:34.640 --> 24:40.160
He's 73 years old, and he has no faith
in Durham law enforcement

24:40.480 --> 24:44.880
being interested in the truth
as opposed to being interested

24:44.960 --> 24:48.240
in convicting him
and twisting evidence to that purpose.

24:48.440 --> 24:52.680
So I just wanna make clear that that's why
we're entering this Alford plea,

24:52.760 --> 24:55.560
not for any of the reasons
that Mr. Dornfried indicated.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.560
All right,
the court does find as a fact

25:00.640 --> 25:04.440
that the state has offered
a sufficient factual basis.

25:04.720 --> 25:08.560
Mr. Peterson, are you able to hear
and understand me, sir?

25:09.040 --> 25:09.880
Yes, sir.

25:09.960 --> 25:13.440
Do you understand that you do have
the right to remain silent

25:13.520 --> 25:16.320
and that any statement you make
may be used against you?

25:16.480 --> 25:17.320
Yes, sir.

25:17.560 --> 25:20.680
Mr. Peterson, you've indicated
on the transcript here

25:20.760 --> 25:24.680
that you believe you can read, write,
communicate at the college level.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.200
- Is that correct, sir?
- Yes, sir.

25:26.560 --> 25:30.960
Mr. Peterson, has this charge
been explained to you by your lawyer?

25:31.320 --> 25:33.800
Do you understand the nature of the charge

25:33.880 --> 25:36.600
and do you understand
every element of this offense?

25:36.720 --> 25:37.560
Yes, sir.

25:37.640 --> 25:40.080
And, sir, have you
and your lawyer discussed

25:40.160 --> 25:44.080
possible defenses, if any,
to this charge?

25:44.600 --> 25:45.440
Yes, sir.

25:45.520 --> 25:49.440
Mr. Peterson, are you satisfied
with your lawyer's legal services?

25:49.600 --> 25:50.440
Yes, sir.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.120
Do you understand, sir,
that you do have the right

25:53.200 --> 25:56.560
to plead "not guilty"
and have a jury trial?

25:56.640 --> 25:57.640
Yes, sir.

25:57.720 --> 26:01.680
And do you understand, Mr. Peterson,
that when you enter a plea of guilty,

26:01.760 --> 26:06.080
you give up all those rights
and that there will not be a jury trial?

26:06.400 --> 26:07.240
Yes, sir.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.240
Mr. Peterson, you're pleading guilty

26:09.320 --> 26:15.240
pursuant to North Carolina v. Alford case
of voluntary manslaughter.

26:15.320 --> 26:21.560
That's a class D felony that carries
the maximum penalty of up to 229 months.

26:21.640 --> 26:22.800
Do you understand, sir?

26:26.520 --> 26:27.360
Yes, sir.

26:27.440 --> 26:32.200
And do you now personally
plead guilty pursuant to the Alford case?

26:32.280 --> 26:33.120
Yes, sir.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.960
Do you understand
that when you enter a plea of Alford

26:37.240 --> 26:39.760
and you do not admit
the fact of your guilt,

26:39.840 --> 26:44.000
the court will treat you as being guilty
for purposes of sentencing you?

26:44.080 --> 26:44.920
Yes, sir.

26:45.120 --> 26:48.640
And do you consider it to be,
Mr. Peterson, in your best interest

26:48.720 --> 26:52.560
to enter a plea of guilty
pursuant to Alford

26:52.640 --> 26:56.040
even though you do not admit
the fact of your guilt?

26:56.640 --> 26:57.480
Yes, sir.

26:57.560 --> 27:01.640
The defendant shall serve an active term
of 64 months minimum

27:01.920 --> 27:04.240
to 86 months maximum.

27:04.600 --> 27:08.520
The defendant shall be given credit
for any time already served

27:08.600 --> 27:10.400
in relation to this offense.

27:10.800 --> 27:15.680
Mr. Peterson, is that correct
as being your full plea arrangement?

27:16.360 --> 27:17.200
Yes, sir.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.920
And do you now
personally accept this arrangement?

27:20.000 --> 27:20.840
Yes, sir.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.320
Mr. Peterson, do you enter this plea
of your own free will,

27:24.400 --> 27:26.200
fully understanding
what you're doing, sir?

27:26.440 --> 27:27.640
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

27:27.720 --> 27:32.080
Court finds that the defendant
is satisfied with his lawyer,

27:32.640 --> 27:34.800
he is competent to stand trial,

27:35.360 --> 27:39.320
his willingness to plead guilty
pursuant to Alford

27:39.640 --> 27:42.800
is the informed choice of the defendant,

27:42.880 --> 27:46.480
that it is made freely, voluntarily,
and understandingly.

27:47.400 --> 27:50.360
Anything as to argument
as to any aspect of sentencing

27:50.440 --> 27:52.360
from the state, Mr. Dornfried?

27:52.440 --> 27:54.360
Your Honor, family members are present

27:54.440 --> 27:56.720
and do wish to address the court
at this time.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.600
- Hear them.
- All right.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.480
My name is Lori Campbell.

28:04.240 --> 28:08.960
Kathleen Peterson was my sister,
Your Honor, Judge Hudson.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.360
It's right that Michael Peterson
finally acknowledges in court

28:13.440 --> 28:17.280
that there is enough evidence
for the prosecution to convict him

28:17.680 --> 28:20.000
for the horrific death
of my sister Kathleen.

28:21.040 --> 28:24.840
Yet it's wrong that after a jury
sentenced him to life in prison

28:24.920 --> 28:26.240
for the murder of his wife,

28:26.480 --> 28:29.480
he gets to be a free man
while Kathleen lies in a grave.

28:30.440 --> 28:34.560
Closure, it's for a door,
not for my murdered sister.

28:36.040 --> 28:36.880
Thank you.

28:42.560 --> 28:43.400
Good morning.

28:46.560 --> 28:47.400
Good morning.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.600
I'm Candace Zamperini,
Kathleen's other sister.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.320
Two months after Kathleen's death,

28:53.720 --> 28:58.000
my husband, Lori, and I drove
in February 2002 for the first time

28:58.080 --> 29:00.600
to meet with district attorney Jim Hardin.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.320
I didn't wanna believe she'd been
murdered. I was sure this was an accident.

29:05.080 --> 29:06.280
At the end of the meeting,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.880
Jim Hardin asked if I wanted to see
the autopsy pictures

29:09.960 --> 29:11.280
and some crime scene photos.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.200
He handed me a large envelope.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.440
It was my Pandora's box.

29:17.560 --> 29:20.960
All the evils of my sister's death
leaped into my eyes.

29:21.400 --> 29:24.040
The horrors of my sister's beating
were shown.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.120
The assaulting of her body.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.880
Instead of leaving me with Pandora's hope,

29:29.720 --> 29:32.960
what was left in the envelope for me
was to bear responsibility

29:33.840 --> 29:35.480
to witness and fight for justice.

29:37.760 --> 29:41.040
Learn the truth and agony
of Kathleen's prolonged death.

29:41.600 --> 29:46.440
Her autopsy states
over 35 cuts, bruises, wounds,

29:46.520 --> 29:48.440
contusions all around her body.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.640
She was strangled,

29:50.080 --> 29:51.960
and the seven death blows
to the back of her head

29:52.040 --> 29:54.040
causing her to bleed slowly to death.

29:56.080 --> 29:59.080
The next confrontation came
from a French film company,

29:59.360 --> 30:02.480
that wanted to make a pseudo-documentary
about my sister's murder,

30:02.800 --> 30:05.600
without my family's cooperation
or consent.

30:06.240 --> 30:09.120
Michael Peterson would have a movie made
that he could pontificate.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.440
He could tell everyone, all of you,
how incompetent

30:12.760 --> 30:14.760
the Durham police and justice system was.

30:14.920 --> 30:17.520
He could proclaim in this film, again,
his complete innocence.

30:18.080 --> 30:21.200
The Staircase film was made,
and twice,

30:21.520 --> 30:26.360
episodes were used to threaten
and scare Kathleen's daughter and myself.

30:26.920 --> 30:29.000
Michael Peterson states in the film,

30:29.480 --> 30:33.960
"If not for Candace and Caitlin,
I would not be here in a courtroom."

30:34.320 --> 30:37.280
And in Episode 8,
filmed in the courtroom,

30:37.360 --> 30:40.080
Michael Peterson, again, clearly says,

30:40.160 --> 30:43.360
"Candace just can't keep
her fucking mouth shut.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.880
I don't think I'd be here
if she shut her mouth."

30:47.840 --> 30:50.240
These statements were threatening to me.

30:50.320 --> 30:52.960
And anyone for eternity
can replay them on YouTube.

30:53.320 --> 30:57.480
And that hurts me and hurts my niece,
and we did nothing to hurt you.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.280
The correct ending to The Staircase

30:59.360 --> 31:05.680
is Michael Peterson was correctly charged
with murder and is pleading guilty today.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.800
I was very innocent 15 years ago

31:08.880 --> 31:11.200
and unprepared for dealing
with press, journalists,

31:11.280 --> 31:14.120
much less a murder trial
for someone I loved.

31:14.760 --> 31:16.360
Now, David Rudolf.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.600
You wanted Michael Peterson to appear
to be the victim.

31:20.760 --> 31:23.120
You went out of your way
to never say my sister's name.

31:23.200 --> 31:26.960
As a matter of fact, in opening arguments,
you called her Kathryn, not Kathleen.

31:27.040 --> 31:30.440
Rudolf picked up Kathleen's clothes
with bare hands--

31:30.520 --> 31:32.960
real good technique there--
in front of the jury,

31:33.040 --> 31:35.960
he handled them,
he threw her clothes on side tables.

31:36.160 --> 31:39.160
You would stare down witnesses,
you would try and stare me down,

31:39.640 --> 31:42.000
you'd try and threaten me,
you'd loudly rant in the courtroom

31:42.080 --> 31:45.280
to the point a juror actually put
his fingers in his ears to drown you out.

31:47.080 --> 31:51.040
I was and I still am astonished
that Michael Peterson and David Rudolf

31:51.120 --> 31:55.520
spent so much time, thought,
energy to focus on me.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.840
I actually think David Rudolf
and Michael Peterson believe

31:57.920 --> 31:59.560
I have some supernatural power,

32:00.160 --> 32:02.600
or maybe I'm the all-powerful
Wizard of Oz!

32:03.000 --> 32:04.800
Both of you tried to shut me down,

32:05.160 --> 32:07.320
or shut my "effing" mouth,
as you said, Michael.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.520
But you know what? It didn't matter.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.040
Jury focused on the crime scene pictures,

32:12.880 --> 32:16.520
Kathleen's blood washed and splattered
all over the staircase walls,

32:16.840 --> 32:19.520
Kathleen's blood splattered up
inside your shorts

32:19.600 --> 32:20.720
that you wore that night.

32:21.280 --> 32:24.280
They also focused on just her battered,
beaten body.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.120
Lastly, Michael Peterson.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.800
The words "Alford plea,"
they're meaningless.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.280
Alford schaml-ford!

32:32.520 --> 32:34.120
It means nothing. Guilt.

32:35.680 --> 32:38.720
You brutally took the life of a woman
that provided for you

32:39.080 --> 32:40.960
and guided your children,
loved your children.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.120
She loved you.

32:42.880 --> 32:46.120
She made a home people complimented.
She cooked extravagantly.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.040
She opened her heart and home with joy.

32:48.120 --> 32:51.760
Kathleen was the best person
you ever had in your life.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.760
Michael Peterson, you are pleading guilty
to voluntarily manslaughter,

32:56.840 --> 33:00.360
you will be treated as guilty
for murdering my sister Kathleen

33:00.520 --> 33:03.400
and you will be a convicted felon
forever.

33:04.400 --> 33:08.360
This hearing today is as close to justice
as anything I think can be found.

33:09.480 --> 33:13.200
You served almost 9 years in prison,
you lost your reputation,

33:13.400 --> 33:15.560
you lost your home, you're indigent,

33:16.480 --> 33:17.760
and now finally today,

33:17.840 --> 33:20.720
what my family has always,
always wanted to hear:

33:20.960 --> 33:22.720
You are pleading guilty today

33:23.880 --> 33:25.800
to beating my sister Kathleen to death.

33:26.840 --> 33:31.240
Michael Peterson, not only can you wear
the scarlet letter "A" for "adultery,"

33:31.840 --> 33:34.320
but also the black letter "G"
for "guilty."

33:35.000 --> 33:37.280
Not perfect justice, but justice.

33:37.920 --> 33:38.840
Thank you, Your Honor.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.040
All right,
anything else from the defense?

33:49.320 --> 33:51.360
- Do you want to say something?
- I don't think so.

33:52.000 --> 33:52.840
You sure?

33:53.640 --> 33:54.480
No, Your Honor.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.080
All right.
The defendant Mr. Peterson is sentenced

34:00.160 --> 34:05.200
pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this negotiated arrangement.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.719
His plea of guilty pursuant to Alford
is accepted by the court.

34:11.239 --> 34:15.280
He is sentenced to an active term
of 64 months minimum,

34:15.360 --> 34:19.920
86 months maximum
in the Division of Adult Correction.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.880
Mr. Peterson served,
unjustly, I might add, 98 months

34:25.480 --> 34:30.840
in the Department of Correction,
which exceeds his sentence.

34:30.920 --> 34:34.000
And he doesn't need to report anywhere
and he's free to go at this point.

34:34.480 --> 34:37.159
All right, the court does find
that he has served his term

34:37.239 --> 34:38.360
and he is free to go.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.159
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you, sir.

34:41.560 --> 34:44.440
- Anything else, Counselor?
- Nothing, Your Honor.

34:44.520 --> 34:47.080
- All right, shut us down, Mr. Deputy.
- All rise.

34:49.480 --> 34:50.400
Oyez, oyez.

34:50.480 --> 34:53.560
This session is cleared, the courtroom
of Durham County is now in recess.

34:53.639 --> 34:54.480
Signed out.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.280
- Okay.
- We'll have a seat.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.120
Wait for all these people
get out of here.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.320
Yup, yup, yup. Okay.

35:01.120 --> 35:01.960
Okay.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.040
Michael Peterson, to me,

35:04.720 --> 35:06.880
lives a fictional life
and does not tell the truth.

35:06.960 --> 35:09.120
Anything he has to say
is absolutely meaningless.

35:09.760 --> 35:10.840
I beat my chest.

35:11.520 --> 35:14.040
He plead guilty.
It felt good, it really did.

35:14.480 --> 35:18.600
An innocent man does not plead guilty.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.960
Mr. Peterson plead guilty today,

35:22.040 --> 35:24.320
and that is how
he will be treated forever.

35:25.480 --> 35:26.560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:26.640 --> 35:28.520
- Thank you very much.
- You're more than welcome.

35:35.360 --> 35:38.000
It's not fair, it's not right.

35:38.400 --> 35:41.840
I am innocent,
and yet I've got this verdict there.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.720
Pleas are deals.
That's all there is to it.

35:46.760 --> 35:49.920
This deal is not a good one for me

35:50.320 --> 35:54.160
because I've got that "manslaughter"
on my record.

35:54.800 --> 35:58.200
It is a great deal
for the district attorney.

35:58.880 --> 36:03.200
One thing that Lori said today is true.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.120
There is no closure.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.160
This is not an end.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.560
We all lost someone precious.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.800
That person's gone, and...

36:17.280 --> 36:21.880
I will bear that loss far, far more

36:22.480 --> 36:25.640
than the verdict that came out today.

36:26.520 --> 36:27.480
That's all I got to say.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.920
-
- Okay, guys, thank you much.

37:23.840 --> 37:26.480
I'm not sure I'd say
the liars have won.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.280
I mean, Michael's gonna continue
to live his life.

37:30.200 --> 37:35.040
Whether he was found not guilty
at a next trial, or this is the result,

37:35.240 --> 37:39.600
is not gonna make one bit
of practical difference to Michael.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.960
What will make a difference to the system,

37:43.760 --> 37:49.880
maybe going forward,
is that these lies were exposed.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.160
And what was exposed was that

37:52.600 --> 37:58.240
the state wasted millions
and millions of dollars in resources

37:58.720 --> 38:00.840
to convict an innocent person.

38:01.880 --> 38:07.960
And it happens more frequently
than people want to admit.

38:09.240 --> 38:15.440
Although he spent eight years in prison,
maybe time that he should not have spent,

38:15.920 --> 38:19.240
certainly his conviction was reversed.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.160
That is very strong evidence

38:22.240 --> 38:25.200
that the criminal justice system
does work.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.960
I thought the jury got the case fairly,

38:28.480 --> 38:35.240
which meant that they got the evidence
that both parties wanted them to have.

38:35.640 --> 38:36.560
Um...

38:37.440 --> 38:42.320
Over the years, though,
you can see how with time

38:42.400 --> 38:47.400
and more examination of...
of the evidence that did come in,

38:47.960 --> 38:48.800
how...

38:49.680 --> 38:53.320
maybe it wasn't without prejudice.

38:54.640 --> 38:57.040
And so, if you get a chance
to do it over again,

38:57.120 --> 38:59.960
which I certainly
would have gotten that chance,

39:00.600 --> 39:03.560
there were things that I would have--
I would have changed.

39:06.080 --> 39:11.400
You know, I think over time,
the introduction of the death in Germany

39:11.760 --> 39:17.080
was very prejudicial to the defendant.

39:17.880 --> 39:22.160
I thought
that all the homosexual evidence,

39:22.240 --> 39:24.120
however it was used,

39:24.960 --> 39:29.360
would have been unduly prejudicial
to the defense

39:29.440 --> 39:32.320
and probably should not
come into evidence.

39:32.680 --> 39:37.560
And I believe, ultimately,
a fair and reasonable juror

39:38.680 --> 39:42.760
could make a different decision
that was made by that first jury.

39:45.520 --> 39:47.520
I think I could have had
a reasonable doubt.

40:08.400 --> 40:10.040
- Hey, Dad!
- Oh, my God!

40:10.120 --> 40:12.400
- I watched the... the hearing...
- Uh-huh.

40:12.480 --> 40:13.720
...online this morning.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.040
And?

40:16.560 --> 40:19.680
- Candace is crazy.
- Yeah. Yeah.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.800
Oh, God, I didn't realize it was that bad.

40:22.880 --> 40:23.840
Yeah. Yeah.

40:24.680 --> 40:27.600
Here's some news for you, though, okay?
I know you wanna know about Caitlin.

40:27.680 --> 40:28.520
She was there.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.240
I hope she's doing well.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.760
Well, you know what?
I think, I guess she is.

40:32.840 --> 40:33.840
Caitlin has twins.

40:34.720 --> 40:37.120
Caitlin has twins, that's so cool!

40:37.200 --> 40:41.200
Yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah, yeah.
And I had a long talk with your sister.

40:41.800 --> 40:45.640
She's thinking maybe down the road,
it'd all work out with you three.

40:45.720 --> 40:46.560
What do you think?

40:48.880 --> 40:49.720
Oh...

40:51.400 --> 40:54.720
She's such a distant part
of my life that...

40:55.640 --> 40:57.080
I don't know, right now,

40:57.160 --> 41:01.040
I've really been trying
not to go backwards at all.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.200
And just move forward.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.560
But are you okay, dear?

41:05.280 --> 41:07.640
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. I, um...

41:08.200 --> 41:10.560
You know, it's just,
it's a lot of emotions.

41:10.640 --> 41:13.920
Just going through it, and I know,
like, tomorrow it will be easier.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.360
It's just today is the day.

41:16.440 --> 41:19.440
- It's the day that it happened, so...
- I know, I know.

41:20.360 --> 41:24.040
I just kind of took off the afternoon
to calm down and take care of myself.

41:24.120 --> 41:26.760
I was like, "Hey, I think
I'm gonna leave after lunch.

41:26.840 --> 41:28.520
I'll get you through
your morning meetings

41:28.600 --> 41:30.760
and then there's nothing going on
in the afternoon.

41:30.840 --> 41:34.480
You know, I'm just dealing with, like,
some sad family stuff, but, you know,

41:34.560 --> 41:35.520
I'll be fine on Monday."

41:35.600 --> 41:37.120
Well, they all know, don't they?

41:37.760 --> 41:39.920
- No. No way!
- Oh.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.960
I don't tell anybody, Dad.

41:42.040 --> 41:44.560
- Oh, oh, oh.
- No.

41:44.640 --> 41:47.320
Well, I understand.
No, same way with Todd.

41:47.400 --> 41:50.040
He doesn't want this.
Exactly. Who needs it? Right.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.840
- Yeah, 'cause it's my own life, you know?
- Right.

41:52.920 --> 41:57.960
I want people to know me,
not the crazy circumstances around me.

41:58.120 --> 41:59.960
Excellent. That's how it should be.

42:00.520 --> 42:01.360
Yeah.

42:01.480 --> 42:04.320
- It does feel good that it's over.
- Mm-hmm.

42:04.840 --> 42:08.520
I mean, we don't have to go
to any more hearings, there's nothing.

42:08.600 --> 42:14.800
It's-- It's-- We can just all hang out
and not have to talk about legal stuff.

42:14.880 --> 42:18.760
Right. Right.
Well, until somebody else fucks up, right?

42:19.000 --> 42:20.640
-
- Well...

42:20.720 --> 42:22.440
at least your legal stuff.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.680
Well, I'm planning my next one,
all right?

42:26.960 --> 42:28.680
I don't wanna be forgotten, Margaret.

42:46.840 --> 42:48.600
- Hello.
-

42:48.680 --> 42:50.680
Alexa.

42:52.560 --> 42:54.720
I'm gonna have Alexa play
my favorite song. Just a sec.

42:54.800 --> 42:58.440
- Alex, play "Every--"
- Shall I play you music?

42:58.640 --> 42:59.480
Sweet.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.800
- Alexa!
-

43:05.200 --> 43:07.920
Play "Everybody Knows."
Leonard Cohen.

43:09.560 --> 43:11.640
"Everybody Knows"
by Leonard Cohen.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.800
I love this. You know this song?

43:17.080 --> 43:18.880
- Alexa!

"All are punishèd."

45:17.120 --> 45:19.440
It's not the final line.
The final line, of course, is,

45:19.520 --> 45:22.560
"The sun, for sorrow,
will not show his head.

45:22.640 --> 45:26.760
Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.

45:27.320 --> 45:29.760
Some shall be pardoned,
and some punished.

45:30.800 --> 45:36.640
For never was a story of more woe
than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

45:38.640 --> 45:40.320
But I think the real line is...

45:42.360 --> 45:43.680
"All are punishèd."
