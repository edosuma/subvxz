00:32.829 --> 00:35.531
Dude, are you okay?

01:43.818 --> 01:45.352
All right, guys, we're closed.

01:45.420 --> 01:47.788
Everybody up.

01:47.856 --> 01:49.824
Time to go home.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.100
Come on, man.

02:00.536 --> 02:02.203
Dude, wake up.

02:02.271 --> 02:05.039
Come on, man. Gotta go.
Party's over.

02:06.475 --> 02:09.309
Open this door,
or I'm gonna open it <i>for</i> you.

02:16.451 --> 02:17.885
Hey, man?

02:18.887 --> 02:21.021
Hey, man, it's time to go, ma...

02:24.326 --> 02:26.060
keys in his pocket.

02:26.161 --> 02:27.428
No wallet.

02:27.496 --> 02:30.731
Don't step in here yet.
I have to preserve... The fluids.

02:31.399 --> 02:32.399
God.

02:32.501 --> 02:33.534
So he didn't valet.

02:33.602 --> 02:35.002
Yeah, the guy drives a Ford.

02:35.070 --> 02:37.339
See if you can find it parked close by.

02:38.074 --> 02:42.845
Why am I here
at 3:30 <i>A.M.?</i>

02:42.913 --> 02:45.014
Because, instead of calling 911,

02:45.082 --> 02:47.684
the owner of the club
called his really good friend.

02:47.752 --> 02:49.419
Chief of police William Henry Pope.

02:49.487 --> 02:52.289
The bouncer, however, phoned paramedics,

02:52.357 --> 02:55.426
and they pronounced the guy
at 2: <i>A.M.</i>

02:55.494 --> 02:58.229
And the body is still in the bathroom stall

02:58.296 --> 03:00.398
a full hour later because...?

03:00.465 --> 03:03.100
'Cause in order to do a proper
alcohol-consumption test,

03:03.168 --> 03:05.002
we need the guy's stomach contents,

03:05.070 --> 03:06.670
a lot of which is on the floor

03:06.738 --> 03:08.372
around the toilet where he threw up.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.609
Kendall needs to collect his vomit, too.

03:10.676 --> 03:13.478
I don't have to film that, do I?

03:13.546 --> 03:14.747
I don't know.

03:15.648 --> 03:17.282
Yes, yes...
film, film.

03:17.350 --> 03:20.953
I mean, even if the guy
drank himself to death,

03:21.021 --> 03:24.189
until we know better, we got to
handle this like a murder.

03:25.658 --> 03:26.925
The men's room...

03:26.993 --> 03:28.960
join the L.A.P.D,
see the world, right?

03:29.028 --> 03:30.962
None of the staff...
hold on, hold on.

03:31.063 --> 03:32.364
What's the matter?

03:34.033 --> 03:35.834
There's no visible wounds.

03:35.901 --> 03:38.103
And the guy looks like he's in great shape.

03:39.238 --> 03:42.040
Hey, I've been there before,
but I always got up.

03:42.108 --> 03:44.075
Why didn't the bartenders cut him off

03:44.143 --> 03:45.311
if he was this drunk?

03:45.378 --> 03:47.058
None of the staff I cycled through earlier

03:47.108 --> 03:49.148
recognized our dead guy,
except for one bartender,

03:49.215 --> 03:50.670
who said he stumbled up to a stool

03:50.671 --> 03:51.951
a couple hours before last call.

03:52.019 --> 03:53.481
Victim didn't order anything,

03:53.482 --> 03:55.922
but doesn't mean that someone
else wasn't buying him drinks.

03:55.990 --> 03:57.324
Yeah, maybe his partner.

03:57.391 --> 03:58.825
Partner?

03:58.893 --> 04:00.527
You mean, as in the guy is gay?

04:00.595 --> 04:03.631
No, sir, as in the guy's
a Detective from Las Vegas.

04:03.698 --> 04:04.765
Michael v. Adams.

04:04.833 --> 04:05.953
I found his official vehicle

04:05.954 --> 04:07.794
parked out front, sir,
with all this stuff...

04:07.803 --> 04:11.305
guy's badge, gun, wallet, I.D.,
two keys to a hotel room,

04:11.373 --> 04:14.175
$128 in cash, and a few business cards.

04:14.276 --> 04:15.944
400 people in this bar...

04:16.011 --> 04:18.613
one guy dies, and it happens
to be a police Detective?

04:18.680 --> 04:19.982
<i>That,</i> I don't like.

04:20.048 --> 04:22.089
Andy, can I have that badge?
I want to call Vegas.

04:23.220 --> 04:24.320
Flynn.

04:26.223 --> 04:27.624
Yeah, sure.

04:28.526 --> 04:31.982
If Detective Adams came here
in his police car,

04:31.983 --> 04:33.263
he could have been here on duty.

04:33.331 --> 04:34.998
Well, then, where's his partner?

04:35.066 --> 04:37.100
Why didn't they check in
with L.A.P.D.?

04:37.168 --> 04:40.936
Flynn, how many times have
we been to Vegas on business?

04:41.004 --> 04:43.305
We never notify them.

04:44.207 --> 04:47.109
Well, we're notified now.

04:47.177 --> 04:49.878
So, we think too much of a good thing?

04:49.946 --> 04:51.279
Possibility, yeah.

04:51.347 --> 04:53.648
Well, unless they've been
overconsuming for years,

04:53.716 --> 04:57.318
people usually pass out before
they kill themselves drinking.

04:57.386 --> 05:01.155
And this guy does not
look like an alcoholic to me.

05:01.223 --> 05:03.190
What about asphyxiating on his own vomit?

05:03.258 --> 05:05.526
Nothing in his throat, no.

05:05.594 --> 05:07.962
I'll run tests, but I think they'll say

05:08.030 --> 05:09.731
that the victim had a couple of drinks

05:09.798 --> 05:11.132
about six hours before death.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.734
And you can tell that how?
Two ways.

05:12.835 --> 05:15.637
I poured the vomit that Kendall
collected into this tray.

05:15.705 --> 05:17.105
Would you like to take a whiff?

05:17.173 --> 05:18.540
What's the other way?

05:18.608 --> 05:20.208
Turn off the light.

05:22.045 --> 05:24.112
Watch this.

05:27.650 --> 05:29.218
How 'bout that,

05:29.285 --> 05:31.419
Looks like he had a hell of a Margarita,

05:31.487 --> 05:32.621
but what does it mean?

05:33.723 --> 05:34.789
That you have a murder.

05:34.857 --> 05:35.991
And your visiting Detective

05:36.058 --> 05:38.260
died from Ethylene Glycol poisoning.

05:38.361 --> 05:39.294
Antifreeze.

05:39.362 --> 05:40.663
Correct.

05:40.730 --> 05:43.532
The fluorescent agent is added
to detect leaks in cars.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.301
Very, very deadly stuff.

05:45.368 --> 05:47.503
And you were able to smell this?

05:47.570 --> 05:49.605
Such is the life I lead.

05:49.672 --> 05:50.973
Okay, Dick Tracy,

05:51.040 --> 05:53.542
how'd you know
this green glop was antifreeze?

05:53.610 --> 05:56.445
Guys stop drinking.
They throw out all the alcohol.

05:56.546 --> 05:57.546
Wife's happy.

05:57.613 --> 05:58.780
Then they get the urge,

05:58.848 --> 06:00.615
and they sneak out into the garage

06:00.683 --> 06:03.452
and they strain the antifreeze,
thinking it'll be okay.

06:03.553 --> 06:04.720
And they end up dead.

06:05.555 --> 06:06.989
Not a bad way to poison someone.

06:07.056 --> 06:09.024
Can you taste this stuff in a drink?

06:09.092 --> 06:10.660
Well, they say it's sweet.

06:12.096 --> 06:15.565
I think it would mix very well
with a... Mojito.

06:15.633 --> 06:16.799
Or a kamikaze.

06:16.867 --> 06:19.202
Okay, look, Detective Adams drives

06:19.269 --> 06:22.138
from Vegas to L.A.
in his police car,

06:22.206 --> 06:24.407
but he wasn't wearing a suit.

06:24.475 --> 06:26.476
He left his gun and his badge in the car.

06:26.544 --> 06:29.079
Was he here on business or not?

06:30.415 --> 06:33.016
His partner didn't think
Adams was working a case.

06:33.084 --> 06:35.151
He was surprised
he was in L.A. at all.

06:35.219 --> 06:36.319
No friends or family.

06:36.386 --> 06:37.586
What's the partner's name?

06:37.654 --> 06:39.388
Detective Richard Conner.

06:39.456 --> 06:42.258
He gave me the victim's basics.

06:42.326 --> 06:45.161
Adams was a 10-year veteran
of Vegas P.D.

06:45.229 --> 06:47.349
He and Conner worked fraud
for the last three years.

06:47.350 --> 06:48.631
Quite a few open cases.

06:48.699 --> 06:51.834
You'll be surprised to learn
Vegas has a lot of scams.

06:51.902 --> 06:53.636
What?
Shocking, I know.

06:54.371 --> 06:58.274
Conner has some investigations
with connections to L.A.

06:58.342 --> 07:00.109
Did he identify any of those connections?

07:00.177 --> 07:01.412
No, but,

07:01.413 --> 07:03.013
When I searched the victim's hotel room,

07:03.080 --> 07:05.649
I did find some DMV runs
for a Laura Elkins.

07:05.717 --> 07:08.985
She lives in Silver Lake,
married, two children.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.487
No criminal record.

07:10.554 --> 07:12.754
Adams ran her name three times
in the last two months.

07:12.755 --> 07:14.195
She's on her way down to talk to us,

07:14.196 --> 07:15.525
but she doesn't know why, ma'am.

07:15.593 --> 07:18.194
Did Adams meet or speak with
Mrs. Elkins while he was here?

07:18.262 --> 07:19.462
Not at his hotel.

07:19.530 --> 07:21.364
But the hotel security footage

07:21.432 --> 07:24.034
had a great angle
on the hallway to his room.

07:24.102 --> 07:25.569
And no one but Adams and the maids

07:25.637 --> 07:27.505
ever went in or out of the door.

07:28.874 --> 07:30.041
I'll be in the break room.

07:30.143 --> 07:31.783
And if Mr. Dunn
ever bothers to show up,

07:31.784 --> 07:33.904
tell him that I am not
spending the weekend with him

07:33.905 --> 07:35.546
till he learns to tell time.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.820
Where's the victim's cellphone?

07:41.887 --> 07:44.655
He didn't have it on him.
Not in his car or at the hotel.

07:44.723 --> 07:45.790
Pinging it.

07:45.858 --> 07:47.125
Nothing.

07:47.192 --> 07:48.752
I'll let you know if I get back online.

07:48.753 --> 07:50.861
Detective, anything else in the hotel room?

07:50.929 --> 07:52.162
Just an overnight bag.

07:52.230 --> 07:54.131
Though, you know, he had two keys,

07:54.198 --> 07:55.932
and the room
had a king-size bed.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.200
Two keys is standard,

07:57.268 --> 07:59.936
even if it's only one person checking in.

08:00.004 --> 08:01.904
But also... Condoms.

08:01.972 --> 08:03.740
He was a single guy.

08:03.808 --> 08:06.476
Boy scouts aren't the only ones
who like to be prepared.

08:06.544 --> 08:08.178
But <i>wasn't</i> prepared, was he?

08:08.246 --> 08:09.761
I mean, Adams went into a bar

08:09.762 --> 08:12.082
and wound up lying dead on
the floor of a bathroom stall.

08:12.149 --> 08:14.549
I mean, I'm pretty sure that's
not what he came here to do.

08:14.550 --> 08:17.086
He drove to Los Angeles
in his official vehicle,

08:17.154 --> 08:19.255
he had his gun and his badge with him,

08:19.323 --> 08:21.424
and someone that he wanted to talk to.

08:21.492 --> 08:23.426
And his partner doesn't know?

08:24.228 --> 08:25.762
Andy's right...
doesn't add up.

08:25.830 --> 08:28.064
If it means anything, without my asking,

08:28.093 --> 08:29.933
Detective Adams' partner,
Conner, volunteered

08:30.000 --> 08:32.934
to put all their cases that have
even the smallest link to L.A.

08:33.003 --> 08:35.772
In his car and drive them
straight to our offices.

08:35.873 --> 08:37.573
He'll be here any minute now.

08:38.876 --> 08:40.544
Sorry I'm late.

08:42.380 --> 08:44.048
One moment, Daniel.

08:44.849 --> 08:47.685
Lieutenant Tao,
let's check on Detective Conner

08:47.752 --> 08:50.455
and find out just how far away he is.

08:50.556 --> 08:52.724
And please let me know the moment that...

08:52.791 --> 08:53.892
what... what's her name?

08:53.959 --> 08:54.959
Laura Elkins.

08:55.060 --> 08:56.261
Laura Elkins comes.

08:56.329 --> 08:59.464
And, I will be in the break room.

09:00.633 --> 09:01.666
Excuse me.

09:02.902 --> 09:05.737
Daniel, this way.

09:07.006 --> 09:08.239
We have a little problem.

09:09.442 --> 09:12.143
Antifreeze isn't the only thing
here that smells off.

09:13.045 --> 09:14.546
You got that right.

09:18.302 --> 09:20.696
So, what's the problem?

09:23.538 --> 09:25.372
You were supposed to pick Rusty up

09:25.440 --> 09:27.775
to spend your first weekend
together last night,

09:27.842 --> 09:30.944
and you threw him by saying
you couldn't come until today,

09:31.012 --> 09:32.746
and now you are two hours late,

09:32.814 --> 09:35.082
and Rusty doesn't want to go anymore.

09:35.150 --> 09:36.217
<i>That's</i> the problem.

09:36.285 --> 09:38.119
I...Didn't realize

09:38.186 --> 09:40.621
that being late was such a big deal.

09:40.689 --> 09:43.491
For a child abandoned
by his mother at a Zoo

09:43.558 --> 09:46.227
and then stood up by her at a bus station,

09:46.294 --> 09:48.395
not showing up is a very big deal.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.364
And I will not make Rusty go with you today

09:50.432 --> 09:52.232
if he doesn't want to, because, frankly,

09:52.300 --> 09:55.803
I find your behavior
both insensitive and suspicious.

09:55.871 --> 09:58.271
S-s-suspicious? What? It's like
you're testing this boy out

09:58.272 --> 10:00.107
to see if he fits in with your life.

10:00.175 --> 10:02.377
And I also find it a little odd

10:02.445 --> 10:04.913
that Rusty's grandparents
and your sister haven't called.

10:04.980 --> 10:10.085
Why is it that <i>no one</i> from
your family has contacted DCFS?

10:10.152 --> 10:11.553
Just... h-hold on.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.989
Look, I haven't told my parents
about Rusty yet

10:14.056 --> 10:15.590
because this problem is...

10:16.926 --> 10:17.859
it...

10:19.995 --> 10:22.130
I've been honest with you from the start.

10:22.197 --> 10:23.631
My fiancÃ©e, Annie...

10:23.699 --> 10:25.467
she's got...
she's got daughters.

10:25.534 --> 10:28.069
They're <i>young</i> daughters.

10:28.137 --> 10:30.506
And she's much...

10:30.573 --> 10:32.541
she's much better off
than I am financially.

10:32.609 --> 10:34.809
So for me to pop up with a son,
to spring that on her,

10:34.810 --> 10:36.810
I was afraid that it would look
like I was trying

10:36.811 --> 10:38.251
to take advantage of her generosity.

10:38.282 --> 10:40.717
And it may be hard for you to grasp,

10:40.785 --> 10:42.820
but telling Annie about Rusty

10:42.887 --> 10:44.822
has created a very difficult
situation for me.

10:44.889 --> 10:47.825
<i>Rusty</i> is the one with
a difficult situation, Daniel,

10:47.893 --> 10:49.961
and the fact
that you don't understand that,

10:50.028 --> 10:51.095
I find disturbing.

10:51.163 --> 10:53.364
You do have DCFS' permission

10:53.432 --> 10:56.367
to take your son for the weekend,

10:56.435 --> 10:57.668
but I'm not making him go.

10:57.736 --> 10:59.536
No, wait.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:59.604 --> 11:01.404
Annie's expecting to meet him.
I <i>need</i> Rusty.

11:01.464 --> 11:02.824
I don't give a damn what you need.

11:02.825 --> 11:04.775
And, by the way,
usually, when people tell me

11:04.843 --> 11:07.011
that I don't understand their situation,

11:07.079 --> 11:08.579
they end up under arrest.

11:10.716 --> 11:11.582
H-hold on.

11:11.650 --> 11:15.519
Just...
just hold on.

11:16.655 --> 11:20.391
I...Want to fix this.

11:21.193 --> 11:22.427
How do I fix this?

11:22.495 --> 11:26.432
I'm looking forward to seeing you try.

11:38.879 --> 11:41.780
I gather that you're angry with me

11:41.848 --> 11:45.317
because, all the schedule changes.

11:45.385 --> 11:49.355
And, on top of everything else,
I was on the freeway much...

11:49.423 --> 11:51.357
does your cellphone not work or something?

11:51.425 --> 11:53.259
Because calling
when you're going to be late

11:53.326 --> 11:56.261
is just, like, good manners, dude.

11:56.329 --> 11:57.530
I'm sorry, bud.

11:57.631 --> 11:58.664
I...

11:59.854 --> 12:01.774
I thought that
if I pulled off the road to call

12:01.775 --> 12:02.935
that I would be even later...

12:03.003 --> 12:04.883
when I am really
looking forward to something,

12:04.884 --> 12:06.806
I'm like an <i>hour</i> early.

12:08.175 --> 12:09.709
But forget that.

12:09.776 --> 12:13.378
What you need to know
is that I... Wait...10...Minutes,

12:13.446 --> 12:14.880
and then I'm gone.

12:14.947 --> 12:17.082
Because <i>my</i> time is worth something, too.

12:18.450 --> 12:20.951
Sharon, it's okay.
I got this.

12:21.019 --> 12:24.956
If you decide to leave,
just talk to me before you go.

12:25.791 --> 12:26.857
Daniel.

12:33.732 --> 12:36.533
So, anyway, Mrs. Elkins is here
with her two kids.

12:36.601 --> 12:38.302
She's in interview room 2.

12:38.369 --> 12:40.670
Doesn't seem to be expecting any bad news,

12:40.738 --> 12:42.205
but I'd like to try to find out

12:42.273 --> 12:43.640
why Adams was so interested in her

12:43.708 --> 12:45.875
before we tell her
anything about his murder.

12:47.579 --> 12:49.980
Captain... Adams' partner,
Detective Conner,

12:50.048 --> 12:51.081
is on his way up.

12:51.149 --> 12:52.549
I'm gonna meet him at the elevator.

12:52.583 --> 12:53.683
Thank you, Lieutenant.

12:53.751 --> 12:55.151
Let him join you in electronics

12:55.219 --> 12:56.586
while we talk
to Mrs. Elkins.

12:56.687 --> 12:58.188
See if he recognizes her.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.689
Yeah.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.894
Hi, Mrs. Elkins.

13:05.729 --> 13:08.864
I'm Lieutenant Andy Flynn
of the L.A.P.D,

13:08.932 --> 13:11.967
and this is captain Sharon Raydor.

13:12.034 --> 13:13.201
Hello.

13:13.269 --> 13:15.149
Does this mean
that someone found my computer?

13:16.039 --> 13:16.905
Please say yes.

13:16.973 --> 13:18.740
Well, that was easy.

13:18.808 --> 13:22.844
<i>Well, it all depends, ma'am.</i>

13:22.912 --> 13:25.379
<i>Unfortunately, we're not allowed</i>

13:25.447 --> 13:26.380
to just show it to you.

13:26.448 --> 13:27.448
O...

13:27.516 --> 13:29.083
In determining ownership,

13:29.151 --> 13:31.852
we need for you
to review with us once again

13:31.920 --> 13:33.687
how you lost possession of your property

13:33.754 --> 13:35.555
and what steps you took to try to find it.

13:35.623 --> 13:37.757
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

13:37.825 --> 13:40.193
I was at check-in
at the temple resort and casino.

13:40.261 --> 13:41.361
In Las Vegas?

13:41.429 --> 13:42.896
Yes, and I put my computer bag down

13:42.964 --> 13:44.966
while I was hunting for my credit card.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.868
And then I stepped away from the front desk

13:46.936 --> 13:48.970
because I couldn't find my wallet,

13:49.037 --> 13:51.472
and when I came back, my laptop was gone.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.742
Were you there on business
or... Vacation?

13:53.809 --> 13:56.111
No.
It's always business.

13:56.178 --> 13:59.314
I've been traveling
a lot lately... too much.

13:59.382 --> 14:00.482
<i>That must be hard...</i>

14:00.550 --> 14:01.783
Hey, guys.

14:01.851 --> 14:04.586
This is Detective rich Conner from Vegas.

14:06.121 --> 14:07.221
He's our victim's partner.

14:07.289 --> 14:08.923
That's Buzz, there at the controls.

14:08.991 --> 14:11.259
Lieutenant Mike Tao,
that you spoke with earlier.

14:11.326 --> 14:14.061
Thanks, Detective,
for driving down so fast.

14:14.129 --> 14:15.196
So sorry for your loss.

14:15.263 --> 14:16.631
Thanks.

14:16.698 --> 14:19.133
Is this the woman
whose license Mike was running?

14:19.201 --> 14:20.568
Yes.

14:20.635 --> 14:22.503
We were hoping you might recognize her.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.371
So am I, Lieutenant.

14:24.438 --> 14:26.718
<i>I absolutely can't
conduct my business without a laptop.</i>

14:26.740 --> 14:29.775
<i>Did you make a theft
report to the Las Vegas police?</i>

14:29.843 --> 14:32.478
<i>Well... Yeah.</i>
<i>I mean, of course I did.</i>

14:32.545 --> 14:34.246
That's why you called me in, right?

14:35.715 --> 14:38.283
Well, they sent out this
very nice Detective Adams...

14:39.252 --> 14:41.386
<i>who looked for my laptop all over the place</i>

14:41.454 --> 14:42.921
<i>and then talked to me</i>

14:42.989 --> 14:45.924
about how not to become
a victim of identity theft.

14:45.992 --> 14:48.227
Did Detective Adams
ever follow up with you?

14:48.295 --> 14:49.228
Yes.

14:49.296 --> 14:50.663
I spoke to him...

14:50.730 --> 14:53.399
I don't know...
several times.

14:53.467 --> 14:54.834
He was convinced

14:54.902 --> 14:57.503
that someone was going to use
the info on my computer

14:57.571 --> 15:00.340
to, like, establish a line of credit

15:00.407 --> 15:02.241
based on our home equity or something.

15:02.309 --> 15:05.044
Did he say why he was worried about that?

15:05.112 --> 15:08.748
Well, apparently, he and his partner

15:08.816 --> 15:11.317
<i>have been investigating</i>
<i>a lot of cases just like mine.</i>

15:11.385 --> 15:13.119
<i>You know, computers stolen from resorts</i>

15:13.187 --> 15:14.821
<i>used to tap into people's credit.</i>

15:14.889 --> 15:17.390
<i>And then he also said</i>

15:17.458 --> 15:19.259
that the thieves were dangerous,

15:19.326 --> 15:21.928
which... which, for me,
was a little scary.

15:21.996 --> 15:24.063
<i>Well, he was right about the danger part.</i>

15:24.164 --> 15:26.632
I didn't think they were <i>that</i> dangerous.

15:26.700 --> 15:27.833
Damn it.

15:27.901 --> 15:29.435
This is the case she's talking about.

15:29.503 --> 15:31.803
Let me get some forms
that we would like you to sign

15:31.871 --> 15:34.739
that would allow us
to monitor your finances.

15:34.807 --> 15:36.374
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>That would be great.</i>

15:36.442 --> 15:37.642
So, you don't know this woman?

15:37.643 --> 15:39.077
Never saw her before.

15:39.144 --> 15:41.579
Any reason your partner might
not have told you about this?

15:43.349 --> 15:47.851
I can't say, but I can tell you
what I <i>do</i> know.

15:49.153 --> 15:50.495
About nine months ago,

15:50.496 --> 15:52.856
several of our hotels were
reporting laptops being stolen.

15:52.924 --> 15:54.524
We later caught some of these thefts

15:54.592 --> 15:56.093
using hotel surveillance footage.

15:56.194 --> 15:58.195
Suspects appeared to be
in their older teens,

15:58.263 --> 16:00.197
but they never looked the same way twice.

16:00.265 --> 16:02.633
16 of these stolen laptops were later used

16:02.701 --> 16:05.703
in a big
identity-theft scheme that...

16:06.738 --> 16:08.018
looked to be based
here in L.A.

16:08.019 --> 16:09.874
All right, hold on a minute.

16:09.942 --> 16:12.382
How come you brought all this
stuff and your partner didn't,

16:12.383 --> 16:14.379
when he was the one out here
working the case?

16:14.447 --> 16:16.248
I told you I don't know.

16:16.316 --> 16:17.350
Yeah?

16:17.417 --> 16:18.613
Well, why didn't he notify us

16:18.614 --> 16:21.054
that he was in our jurisdiction
conducting an investigation?

16:21.121 --> 16:22.789
Probably 'cause
we called the L.A.P.D.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.590
10 times in the last year.

16:24.658 --> 16:26.378
I'd mention credit fraud or identity theft,

16:26.379 --> 16:29.162
and whoever I was talking to
would practically hang up on me.

16:29.229 --> 16:30.549
Now you're all really interested.

16:30.550 --> 16:32.198
Because now someone is dead.

16:32.266 --> 16:35.768
Murder does raise the stakes
somewhat, Detective Conner.

16:35.836 --> 16:37.170
Please continue.

16:38.740 --> 16:40.707
We contacted all the credit agencies

16:40.775 --> 16:42.283
about the victims I've put up here,

16:42.284 --> 16:44.644
set up spreadsheets tracking
all their financial accounts.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.046
Looks like the thieves

16:46.061 --> 16:47.781
mined all these identities for a few months

16:47.782 --> 16:49.342
before taking out loans in their names.

16:49.343 --> 16:51.585
And then invested
the illegally borrowed money

16:51.653 --> 16:52.987
in overseas funds.

16:53.088 --> 16:55.823
Well, that verifies Laura Elkins' story.

16:55.925 --> 16:58.927
How come she's not up on your board,

17:00.997 --> 17:03.558
Okay, so, if I understand your paperwork,

17:03.559 --> 17:04.999
the thieves kept up regular payments

17:05.001 --> 17:06.601
on all the improper loans they took out,

17:06.669 --> 17:09.171
which amount to about $12 million.

17:09.239 --> 17:11.240
Is it even theft
if they're paying back the loans

17:11.308 --> 17:12.934
and making money for these people?

17:12.935 --> 17:15.095
At some point, they'll withdraw
the investment income

17:15.096 --> 17:16.976
and make off with
everything they've borrowed.

17:16.977 --> 17:19.537
Probably right before the I.R.S.
Sends the victims their 1099s.

17:19.605 --> 17:22.244
Right, so we have until then to
figure out who's behind all this.

17:22.246 --> 17:24.526
Don't you think your partner
may have already done that?

17:25.021 --> 17:27.790
Isn't that why he ended up dead
on the floor of a men's room?

17:29.093 --> 17:30.160
Maybe.

17:30.228 --> 17:31.695
You're the homicide expert, not me.

17:31.796 --> 17:34.030
When it comes to investigating
identity fraud,

17:34.098 --> 17:35.699
I try not to jump to conclusions.

17:35.767 --> 17:37.300
Here's a conclusion I'm surprised

17:37.368 --> 17:39.035
you haven't already reached, Detective.

17:39.137 --> 17:41.705
It's no longer identity fraud.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.841
Now it's murder.

17:48.513 --> 17:49.813
I'm going.

17:52.249 --> 17:53.949
Are you sure, Rusty?

17:54.017 --> 17:56.852
I know when people want something from me,

17:56.919 --> 17:58.820
and he wants something.

18:00.856 --> 18:03.458
I wish I could go with you.

18:03.526 --> 18:05.126
Me too.

18:05.194 --> 18:07.128
Come here.

18:19.175 --> 18:20.175
Okay.

18:24.214 --> 18:26.349
Call me if you need me.

18:26.417 --> 18:27.350
I will.

18:27.418 --> 18:28.385
Say it again.

18:28.452 --> 18:30.053
I <i>will.</i>

18:30.121 --> 18:31.188
Thank you.

18:35.860 --> 18:37.500
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of him.

18:37.501 --> 18:38.729
Okay.

18:38.796 --> 18:41.164
Rusty, be...

18:41.999 --> 18:43.533
have a good time.

19:26.381 --> 19:27.381
Tao. Go.

19:27.448 --> 19:28.949
Lieutenant Tao.
Captain.

19:29.050 --> 19:31.852
I may have had an idea how
to find our identity thieves.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.454
Go ahead, Captain.
I'm putting you on speakerphone.

19:34.522 --> 19:36.623
You have me and Andy.

19:36.691 --> 19:39.459
I'm thinking we need to move
this Vegas case along a little.

19:39.527 --> 19:40.860
Me too.

19:40.928 --> 19:42.728
If Adams was here
working his investigation,

19:42.729 --> 19:44.169
it looks like he may have been offed

19:44.170 --> 19:45.490
because he figured something out.

19:45.558 --> 19:48.118
And whoever poisoned the guy has
to know we're looking for him.

19:48.119 --> 19:50.471
But <i>where</i> do we look for them?
That's the question.

19:50.538 --> 19:52.572
These identity thieves

19:52.640 --> 19:55.141
have set up highly compartmentalized

19:55.209 --> 19:57.277
independent investment accounts

19:57.344 --> 20:00.780
inside each of their victims' finances.

20:00.848 --> 20:02.968
Yeah, complete with e-mail
addresses, phone numbers,

20:02.969 --> 20:04.150
and post office boxes.

20:04.218 --> 20:06.538
It's like these criminals
built themselves an extra space

20:06.587 --> 20:08.054
inside these people's lives,

20:08.122 --> 20:10.057
with their own
separate lines of communication,

20:10.125 --> 20:14.028
which we can now use to smoke them out.

20:14.095 --> 20:15.455
So what are you thinking, captain?

20:15.523 --> 20:17.403
I'm thinking that we take
these credit reports

20:17.404 --> 20:18.666
and we send a message

20:18.734 --> 20:21.269
to each one of
these criminal e-mail accounts

20:21.324 --> 20:23.204
with a warning
about potential identity fraud.

20:23.272 --> 20:24.972
The thieves might try to move

20:25.040 --> 20:26.974
all the cash they collected at once.

20:27.042 --> 20:29.522
Exactly, and things are easier
to see when they're in motion.

20:29.544 --> 20:32.479
You want us to do this without
informing Detective Conner?

20:32.547 --> 20:33.947
Yes, I do.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.117
So, what do you want
the e-mail to say, Captain?

20:36.184 --> 20:39.253
"The Los Angeles police
department has reason to believe

20:39.321 --> 20:42.490
"that you may have been
the victim of identity theft

20:42.558 --> 20:45.660
"and that fraudulent investments

20:45.727 --> 20:47.395
and illegal loans may..."

20:47.462 --> 20:49.582
"...may have been improperly
taken out in your name.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.833
"If you will contact
our major crimes division,

20:51.900 --> 20:54.702
"we will, at your request,
put an investigatory hold

20:54.770 --> 20:57.339
"on any and all financial
accounts and instruments

20:57.406 --> 20:59.541
"currently bearing
your social security number.

20:59.609 --> 21:00.942
Signed,
captain Sharon Raydor."

21:01.010 --> 21:02.250
You just warned these criminals

21:02.251 --> 21:04.012
we've got them under surveillance.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.647
Maybe they were already onto you.

21:05.714 --> 21:07.014
Why do you say that?

21:07.082 --> 21:09.162
Because Mike did some DMV runs
of this Elkins woman

21:09.217 --> 21:10.685
and came to Los Angeles?

21:10.752 --> 21:12.520
We say your surveillance was blown

21:12.588 --> 21:15.590
because Detective Adams,
your partner, was murdered.

21:15.658 --> 21:18.193
Or do you not find that suspicious?

21:18.261 --> 21:20.221
I know sending this e-mail out
risked everything

21:20.222 --> 21:22.262
that Mike and I were working on
for the last year.

21:22.263 --> 21:23.232
Not really.

21:23.333 --> 21:25.468
Look how we're spending our Saturday.

21:25.536 --> 21:27.670
...400,000 U.S. dollars.

21:27.738 --> 21:29.172
Let me take a guess...

21:29.240 --> 21:31.400
for income tax purposes,
you also need the name of...

21:31.401 --> 21:32.881
That e-mail
you're complaining about

21:32.882 --> 21:34.677
freaked out our identity thieves.

21:34.745 --> 21:36.146
As you can see, we've gotten ahold

21:36.213 --> 21:38.381
of everyone's credit reports,
and we're watching

21:38.449 --> 21:40.416
the movement of
their illegally invested funds.

21:40.518 --> 21:43.086
All of the money, including
the borrowed principal,

21:43.187 --> 21:45.722
is being transferred into the same account

21:45.790 --> 21:47.891
at one of our finer investment banks.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.292
Now, we have the account number,

21:49.360 --> 21:51.294
and we're freezing everything
as it comes in.

21:51.361 --> 21:53.761
Now all we need to determine
is who the account belongs to.

21:53.828 --> 21:56.188
It's gonna be someone else
whose identity has been stolen,

21:56.189 --> 21:57.500
and you'll only have the money.

21:57.568 --> 22:00.236
Wai... hang on, hang on, hang on.
Julio... julio has it.

22:00.303 --> 22:05.106
Yes, ma'am, account number...
26-17-52-4-6-3.

22:05.174 --> 22:10.044
Dr. Jeremy Thomas durban Jr.

22:10.112 --> 22:14.081
Date of birth... 3/14/66.

22:14.149 --> 22:15.116
Okay.

22:15.183 --> 22:17.551
Buzz, sending you his social.

22:18.186 --> 22:20.421
And when did Dr. Durban
open this account?

22:20.489 --> 22:22.924
Three hours ago?
Okay, that's very interesting.

22:22.991 --> 22:24.191
Could you e-mail me
that form

22:24.192 --> 22:25.712
to the address on the warrant, please?

22:25.761 --> 22:27.295
Thank you, ma'am.

22:27.396 --> 22:28.963
Okay, I'm showing
Dr. Jeremy Durban...

22:29.031 --> 22:30.751
same social security, same date of birth...

22:30.752 --> 22:35.136
Professor of economics
at Santa Monica university.

22:35.203 --> 22:38.272
Highly unusual coming in on
a Saturday for a consultation.

22:38.340 --> 22:39.940
And I'm especially busy today.

22:40.008 --> 22:42.543
Which is why I offered to pay you $5,000

22:42.611 --> 22:44.278
for the inconvenience.

22:44.346 --> 22:48.248
Look, Dr. Durban, I've heard
such really good things

22:48.316 --> 22:50.050
about your insights.

22:50.118 --> 22:52.485
And I've only inherited this
money a couple of years ago,

22:52.553 --> 22:54.521
and I'm not sure
I have it invested properly.

22:54.588 --> 22:56.089
I <i>know you can help me.</i>

22:56.156 --> 22:59.006
Well, taking your check
feels a little like cheating

22:59.007 --> 23:01.327
since I'm only going to tell you
what I tell my students,

23:01.395 --> 23:03.229
which is...
all things being equal,

23:03.296 --> 23:05.031
most people aren't even experienced enough

23:05.098 --> 23:07.634
to manage their own checking
accounts, much less investments.

23:07.702 --> 23:09.869
And that's even truer
of <i>your</i> demographic...

23:09.937 --> 23:11.371
black and female...

23:11.439 --> 23:13.273
<i>which lacks a considerable depth of field</i>

23:13.340 --> 23:15.242
<i>when it comes to money management.</i>

23:15.309 --> 23:17.043
Be careful in there, Sykes.

23:17.111 --> 23:19.812
If Professor Durban turns out
to be our identity thief,

23:19.879 --> 23:21.914
then he's probably also our murderer.

23:22.783 --> 23:24.950
I understand, and if you think I should

23:25.018 --> 23:27.186
stop supervising this portfolio myself,

23:27.253 --> 23:30.655
I'll be happy to put it
right where you recommend.

23:30.723 --> 23:31.857
Okay, Sykes,

23:31.925 --> 23:33.258
keep your fingers off the glass,

23:33.326 --> 23:35.928
and let's see if this guy
is who he says he is.

23:35.996 --> 23:38.364
Okay, print program is up and running.

23:38.465 --> 23:40.233
<i>Would you like me to open it?
No.</i>

23:40.301 --> 23:41.801
<i>No, I'm well acquainted</i>

23:41.830 --> 23:43.670
<i>with much more advanced</i>
<i>technology than this.</i>

23:43.738 --> 23:44.805
It's almost too simple.

23:44.873 --> 23:46.228
I preferred computing

23:46.229 --> 23:48.709
before it was just another way
of distracting the Hoi Polloi.

23:49.778 --> 23:52.012
<i>All right, let's see.</i>

23:52.080 --> 23:53.714
Okay, Amy, I'm getting started.

23:53.782 --> 23:55.950
Encourage him to touch the device.

23:56.017 --> 23:58.152
The stocks are, on this page,

23:58.220 --> 24:00.621
and if you push the links, you can go to

24:00.689 --> 24:02.490
<i>the individual</i>
<i>real-estate investments</i>

24:02.557 --> 24:03.958
<i>and bonds, et cetera.</i>

24:04.026 --> 24:07.295
Buzz, keep isolating and sending
me copies of his prints.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.729
Markets are jumpy right now.

24:08.797 --> 24:12.066
<i>My God. You have</i>
<i>$20 million here.</i>

24:12.167 --> 24:13.834
<i>$6 million in reits alone.</i>

24:13.901 --> 24:15.135
<i>What's your return on those?</i>

24:15.202 --> 24:17.137
Okay, I'm getting a name...

24:17.205 --> 24:19.906
Ronald David Andrews.

24:19.974 --> 24:22.308
And he has a record...
for fraud.

24:22.376 --> 24:24.243
So he a crook.

24:24.311 --> 24:26.246
That's pretty impressive.

24:26.313 --> 24:28.515
Do you think this guy could kill someone?

24:29.383 --> 24:30.983
Lieutenant, you're getting another name.

24:30.984 --> 24:33.786
Jeffrey Myers Breimer.

24:33.854 --> 24:36.789
And... God...
Donald Clayton Bridge Jr.

24:36.857 --> 24:39.058
He's beginning to sound like a crowd.

24:39.125 --> 24:40.965
Come on, Julio,
before we have to call backup

24:40.994 --> 24:42.094
to arrest all of him.

24:42.161 --> 24:43.762
Flynn, I really don't see this guy

24:43.829 --> 24:46.365
as having been hanging out at
the club where we found Adams.

24:46.432 --> 24:48.900
I don't know... the kids
stealing computers in Vegas?

24:48.968 --> 24:50.435
Probably
Dr. dumb dumb's students.

24:50.536 --> 24:52.871
Maybe one of them
slipped Adams the antifreeze.

24:52.938 --> 24:54.618
It doesn't matter...
I want to arrest him

24:54.619 --> 24:56.499
'cause I can't stand
listening to him anymore.

24:56.542 --> 24:58.676
He's also
Franklin G. Robinson.

24:58.744 --> 25:00.745
Wonder what the "G" stands for.

25:00.813 --> 25:01.613
"Goof ball."

25:01.681 --> 25:02.781
All right, Amy.

25:02.849 --> 25:04.884
He's the bad guy.
Here they come.

25:04.951 --> 25:07.553
Well, good news is, you're rich.

25:07.621 --> 25:10.141
Bad news is, you aren't gonna
make any money off your capital,

25:10.142 --> 25:11.958
because it's improperly invested.

25:12.025 --> 25:13.893
Hie thee to one of the bigger brokerages.

25:13.961 --> 25:15.461
I'm not a fan of their fees,

25:15.562 --> 25:18.564
which tend to eat up
too much of your gains over...

25:21.034 --> 25:22.354
my God.
What... what's going on?

25:22.355 --> 25:23.402
Thanks for the advice.

25:23.469 --> 25:25.237
Now we have some for <i>you,</i>
<i>Dr. Blowhard.</i>

25:25.305 --> 25:26.906
You're under arrest for the murder

25:26.973 --> 25:29.608
of Detective Michael Adams of
the Las Vegas police department.

25:29.676 --> 25:31.577
You have the right to remain silent,

25:31.644 --> 25:32.978
and I can't wait for that.

25:33.046 --> 25:34.613
You have the right to an attorney...

25:34.681 --> 25:38.083
I feel that there have been some
very serious errors made here.

25:38.150 --> 25:39.984
I am a Professor of economics...

25:40.052 --> 25:42.220
and here's a statistic
you might not know...

25:42.288 --> 25:45.056
almost 100% of people
in the cop-killing demographic

25:45.124 --> 25:46.991
end up earning the death penalty.

25:53.310 --> 25:56.627
Let me ask you Ronald David
Jeffrey Myers Donald

25:56.752 --> 26:00.188
Clayton Franklin G.
Dr. Jeremy Thomas durban,

26:00.289 --> 26:02.991
are you sure that none of you
want an attorney?

26:03.059 --> 26:04.392
I've committed no crime.

26:04.460 --> 26:06.161
No one ever lost any money or even paid

26:06.229 --> 26:09.098
an extra penny in taxes
because of what I've done.

26:09.165 --> 26:11.000
And I didn't kill anyone last night.

26:11.067 --> 26:14.037
<i>The idea I was out clubbing</i>
<i>anywhere is ridiculous.</i>

26:14.104 --> 26:15.405
And Vegas?

26:16.674 --> 26:18.341
I...Never... Gamble.

26:18.408 --> 26:20.543
And the people who go there...

26:20.611 --> 26:23.079
No, I don't do Vegas.
Check my travel.

26:23.147 --> 26:25.281
Under what name?

26:25.349 --> 26:28.784
We found 30 driver's licenses
in your residence alone.

26:28.852 --> 26:30.553
The lady has a point,

26:30.621 --> 26:33.723
Dr. John Jacob
Jingleheimer Schmidt.

26:35.126 --> 26:36.359
Okay, look.

26:36.427 --> 26:38.128
Let's try a little informal agreement,

26:38.195 --> 26:39.429
I won't call an attorney

26:39.497 --> 26:40.857
if you don't charge me with murder

26:40.858 --> 26:42.858
before you let me explain
how everything was done

26:42.901 --> 26:45.970
and prove conclusively
that I have never killed anyone

26:46.038 --> 26:47.104
or committed fraud.

26:47.172 --> 26:48.373
No fraud?

26:48.440 --> 26:50.541
What about the college
where you're teaching,

26:50.609 --> 26:53.211
impersonating
the real Dr. Jeremy Durban,

26:53.278 --> 26:56.747
who actually teaches in Missoula, Montana?

26:58.417 --> 27:00.918
When you check Dr. Durban's
credit report, as you should...

27:00.986 --> 27:03.354
as you should with <i>all</i>
<i>these identities you've found...</i>

27:03.422 --> 27:04.955
those credit reports...
which are

27:05.004 --> 27:07.324
the best way of monitoring
identity theft, as you know...

27:07.392 --> 27:08.558
all those credit reports

27:08.626 --> 27:10.493
<i>will tell you that I never, ever,</i>

27:10.561 --> 27:13.096
<i>even once, stole anything</i>
<i>or failed to repay a loan.</i>

27:13.163 --> 27:14.597
What's up, captain?

27:14.665 --> 27:16.032
He's right.

27:16.099 --> 27:18.401
Credit reports aren't just the <i>best</i> way

27:18.469 --> 27:22.571
to monitor identity theft...
they're almost the <i>only</i> way.

27:22.639 --> 27:24.040
That's true, yeah.

27:24.108 --> 27:25.441
So why does Detective Adams

27:25.509 --> 27:27.743
keep running up
Laura Elkins' driver's license?

27:27.811 --> 27:30.780
Her credit report wasn't in the package

27:30.848 --> 27:32.816
that Conner brought from Las Vegas, was it?

27:32.883 --> 27:34.150
No, it wasn't.

27:34.218 --> 27:37.653
We had to ask permission
to monitor her finances.

27:37.721 --> 27:40.590
Buzz, keep an eye on nutty Professor
here for a minute, will you?

27:40.657 --> 27:43.058
If he admits to killing anyone...
I'll come find you.

27:43.126 --> 27:45.661
<i>I promise you, I am fully</i>
<i>capable of defending myself...</i>

27:45.729 --> 27:48.531
We didn't find any of
the computers that were stolen.

27:48.598 --> 27:50.533
They were probably stripped and dumped.

27:50.601 --> 27:52.301
But we do have a lot of flash drives.

27:52.403 --> 27:54.070
Did you find one for Laura Elkins?

27:54.138 --> 27:57.240
Now that you mention it...

27:58.943 --> 27:59.909
No.

28:01.345 --> 28:03.613
It's not with any of
her other stuff, either, ma'am.

28:04.581 --> 28:07.784
May I see Laura's financial report, please?

28:07.851 --> 28:09.486
Look, guys, I just want to remind you,

28:09.487 --> 28:11.687
I never said this woman's laptop
had anything to do...

28:11.755 --> 28:14.490
you knew that she wasn't
involved in your investigation

28:14.558 --> 28:16.992
from the beginning,
and you let us believe so.

28:17.060 --> 28:18.427
No. In fact,
just the opposite.

28:18.495 --> 28:20.496
I told you I didn't know
anything about her.

28:20.597 --> 28:23.499
I told you not to jump to conclusions.

28:34.209 --> 28:35.977
Can you think of any other reason

28:36.044 --> 28:38.680
your partner was doing dmv runs
on Laura Elkins

28:38.781 --> 28:41.015
three times in the past six weeks?

28:41.083 --> 28:43.018
I'd only be guessing, ma'am.

28:43.119 --> 28:45.321
Have a seat.

28:47.957 --> 28:51.526
This might be a good time
to tell you that I've spent

28:51.594 --> 28:54.563
almost my entire career
in internal affairs,

28:54.631 --> 28:57.600
and I am <i>this</i> close
to calling your department

28:57.668 --> 29:00.736
and starting an inquiry into your conduct.

29:00.804 --> 29:02.838
She ain't kiddin', pal.

29:04.374 --> 29:06.442
Okay. All right.

29:06.509 --> 29:08.610
I don't know if this is related,

29:08.678 --> 29:10.879
but this Elkins woman...
she was Mike's type.

29:12.115 --> 29:13.215
Type in what way?

29:13.283 --> 29:14.617
Here's how it worked with him.

29:14.684 --> 29:17.119
He'd... he'd go out
and interview victims,

29:17.187 --> 29:18.888
and if he could end up helping them

29:18.955 --> 29:21.924
and they were, you know,
an attractive woman, he'd...

29:24.227 --> 29:25.795
he'd talk them into
a one-nighter.

29:26.663 --> 29:28.164
Maybe even
a two-nighter.

29:28.231 --> 29:29.965
Mike was just one of those guys

29:30.033 --> 29:32.568
that fell in love every time
he pulled his pants down.

29:32.636 --> 29:35.504
And if the girl gave him any
kind of encouragement at all,

29:35.572 --> 29:37.240
even complimenting his shoelaces,

29:37.307 --> 29:38.474
you know, he'd pursue it.

29:38.542 --> 29:40.776
Pursue?
As in stalk?

29:42.112 --> 29:43.434
I'm gonna find out.

29:43.435 --> 29:45.795
A woman filed a complaint
against Mike about 7 months ago,

29:45.796 --> 29:47.316
and the department gave him a warning.

29:47.384 --> 29:48.704
And when I look into this warning

29:48.705 --> 29:50.519
that your partner was issued,

29:50.587 --> 29:52.521
will it say that you knew nothing

29:52.589 --> 29:55.091
about that incident, either, Detective?

29:55.158 --> 29:59.895
How many women did he do this to
before he was caught?

29:59.963 --> 30:02.498
Mike...

30:04.334 --> 30:05.401
Mike was my partner.

30:05.469 --> 30:07.103
We didn't talk about...

30:07.204 --> 30:08.871
hey!
Listen to me, Conner.

30:08.939 --> 30:12.275
We just ran our asses off
solving your identity-theft case

30:12.343 --> 30:14.777
while you stood here
withholding information

30:14.845 --> 30:17.312
on the murder of a police officer.

30:19.416 --> 30:20.750
Now, the captain asked you...

30:20.817 --> 30:24.820
how many women
did Adams treat like Elkins?!

30:24.888 --> 30:25.888
I-I don't think any.

30:25.956 --> 30:27.122
It looks to me,

30:27.190 --> 30:29.257
if he drove out here for this Elkins woman,

30:29.325 --> 30:31.661
his behavior may have been escalating.

30:31.728 --> 30:32.461
You think?

30:32.529 --> 30:33.796
Is there anyone else

30:33.864 --> 30:36.599
that we should be
looking at in L.A.,

30:36.667 --> 30:38.701
or is Mrs. Elkins
the only one?

30:38.769 --> 30:42.537
I just found a big problem
on her financial statement.

30:42.605 --> 30:43.705
And that would be...?

30:43.773 --> 30:45.807
She said the computer was necessary

30:45.908 --> 30:48.576
for her to conduct her business, right?

30:49.912 --> 30:52.880
You...

30:52.948 --> 30:54.649
You found my laptop.

30:54.716 --> 30:56.017
Yes, we did.

30:56.084 --> 30:59.920
You gave us permission to
monitor your financial history,

30:59.988 --> 31:01.322
and we noticed

31:01.390 --> 31:04.526
that you hadn't purchased
another computer anywhere.

31:04.593 --> 31:08.230
And there were no charges
from anyone in your family

31:08.298 --> 31:10.599
on any of the credit cards over $200

31:10.667 --> 31:12.634
since your trip to Vegas.

31:12.702 --> 31:14.862
<i>The Detectives that called
you back down here tonight</i>

31:14.863 --> 31:16.703
were waiting
down the street from your house.

31:16.704 --> 31:17.972
And when you left,

31:18.040 --> 31:20.308
they entered your residence
with a search warrant.

31:20.376 --> 31:22.443
And surprise, surprise.

31:22.511 --> 31:25.146
Look what we found
sitting right on your desk...

31:25.213 --> 31:27.915
the laptop you reported stolen.

31:27.983 --> 31:30.684
So, given the miraculous nature
of this discovery,

31:30.752 --> 31:32.753
I thought that it would be a good idea

31:32.821 --> 31:35.689
to give you a chance
to explain, once again,

31:35.757 --> 31:38.392
your relationship with Detective Adams.

31:38.460 --> 31:40.862
That is why we read you your rights...

31:40.929 --> 31:43.564
because we want to hear
your side of the story

31:43.632 --> 31:46.267
before we talk with your husband.

31:49.271 --> 31:52.074
You don't... you don't know

31:52.141 --> 31:53.675
what that guy put me through.

31:53.743 --> 31:57.145
Then tell us what happened.

31:57.213 --> 31:59.146
<i>All right.</i>

31:59.214 --> 32:02.617
<i>So, I was checking in to my hotel in Vegas,</i>

32:02.684 --> 32:05.252
and I left my laptop downstairs,

32:05.320 --> 32:07.421
and Mike found it for me.

32:07.489 --> 32:13.393
He explained to me how, by losing it...

32:13.461 --> 32:15.562
I had exposed myself potentially

32:15.630 --> 32:17.397
to this
identity-theft ring

32:17.465 --> 32:20.934
and that...
I was no longer safe.

32:21.002 --> 32:24.538
And, well...

32:24.606 --> 32:27.441
He offered to spend the night.

32:27.509 --> 32:30.010
Look, I know it was a mistake.

32:30.078 --> 32:31.579
But I just...
I thought...

32:31.646 --> 32:33.347
you thought you could put it behind you?

32:33.415 --> 32:36.016
<i>Go home?</i>
<i>No one would ever find out?</i>

32:36.084 --> 32:37.118
<i>But then...</i>

32:37.185 --> 32:40.254
<i>Then he kept calling me.</i>

32:40.322 --> 32:41.856
<i>And at first,</i>

32:41.923 --> 32:44.191
yeah, it was all,
"are you okay?"

32:44.259 --> 32:47.428
And "did you check your credit
report, like I told you to?"

32:47.496 --> 32:49.663
But then it became all about

32:49.731 --> 32:52.900
did I have feelings for him,
like he did for me.

32:52.968 --> 32:54.502
And I-I said no.

32:54.570 --> 32:58.672
And I <i>kept</i> saying no
through about 30 phone calls

32:58.740 --> 33:01.209
and I-I don't know
how many text messages.

33:01.276 --> 33:05.480
And then...

33:05.548 --> 33:09.651
I came home one day...

33:09.719 --> 33:13.889
And he was sitting in my house

33:13.956 --> 33:17.059
with my husband, Jonathan,

33:17.126 --> 33:18.727
and our children,

33:18.795 --> 33:21.396
explaining to them
how he wanted to make sure

33:21.464 --> 33:24.066
that I wasn't involved in this...

33:24.133 --> 33:25.901
Identity-theft thing.

33:25.968 --> 33:27.135
And...

33:28.671 --> 33:31.940
I wanted to scream.

33:32.008 --> 33:36.512
But instead, I walked him to his car,

33:36.579 --> 33:41.417
and I said to stay away
from me and my family.

33:41.484 --> 33:44.519
And then he said,
"or what?"

33:45.621 --> 33:49.124
Please...
please just say

33:49.192 --> 33:51.193
you understand the situation I was in.

33:51.260 --> 33:54.530
<i>Yeah, we understand.</i>
<i>The guy was threatening you.</i>

33:54.598 --> 33:56.599
<i>Yes, exactly, and that's...</i>

33:56.666 --> 33:58.634
that's why, when he asked...

33:58.702 --> 34:00.603
actually, no. You know what?
He <i>insisted.</i>

34:00.670 --> 34:04.039
<i>Insisted</i> that I meet him at that club.

34:04.107 --> 34:07.375
<i>And he was saying all these...</i>
<i>all these crazy things,</i>

34:07.443 --> 34:10.444
<i>like...</i>
<i>like how I had to go</i>

34:10.512 --> 34:11.978
to his hotel room with him

34:12.047 --> 34:15.716
and walk away from my home
and set myself free.

34:15.784 --> 34:20.388
So I pretended to think about it
while we were drinking,

34:20.455 --> 34:22.523
and...

34:22.591 --> 34:24.291
God, please.

34:24.359 --> 34:26.928
Please tell me you understand
what I was going through.

34:26.996 --> 34:27.895
Yeah.

34:27.963 --> 34:29.429
I mean, you'd be surprised

34:29.498 --> 34:31.299
how often we hear this kind of story.

34:31.366 --> 34:32.800
I mean, no kidding.

34:32.868 --> 34:35.469
But let's go back to
the bar, because it seems like

34:35.538 --> 34:38.840
you were trying to give the guy
a chance to back off.

34:38.908 --> 34:41.610
And you only
brought the antifreeze with you

34:41.678 --> 34:43.079
in case he wouldn't.

34:46.116 --> 34:48.518
That kind of thing could happen to anybody.

34:48.585 --> 34:51.621
<i>Yeah. He was</i>
<i>completely off his rocker.</i>

34:51.688 --> 34:53.322
Marriage is tough enough.

34:53.389 --> 34:55.224
You add a third person...

34:55.292 --> 34:57.593
and he was going to talk
to my husband <i>himself</i>

34:57.661 --> 34:59.429
if I wouldn't do it.

34:59.497 --> 35:02.165
So...

35:02.233 --> 35:05.501
I-I slipped about
an ounce

35:05.569 --> 35:08.037
of the antifreeze into his drink

35:08.105 --> 35:10.807
<i>when he went to the bathroom.</i>

35:10.875 --> 35:12.876
But then I got him another drink,

35:12.944 --> 35:15.345
and I put some more antifreeze in it.

35:15.413 --> 35:17.681
And I played like

35:17.749 --> 35:20.250
I was gonna go along with him, you know?

35:21.719 --> 35:23.854
And I took his phone without him noticing,

35:23.921 --> 35:25.956
and I told him I was gonna go home

35:26.023 --> 35:29.625
to say goodbye
to my husband and my children.

35:29.693 --> 35:33.396
Thank God he didn't physically assault you.

35:33.463 --> 35:35.764
No. Yeah.
Thank God.

35:35.832 --> 35:38.200
<i>I mean, could you even imagine</i>
<i>if he had tried</i>

35:38.268 --> 35:39.301
to force himself on me?

35:42.405 --> 35:45.173
Okay, look...

35:45.241 --> 35:47.601
We don't... we don't have to
tell my husband about this...

35:47.611 --> 35:48.911
about this, right?

35:48.979 --> 35:50.012
No, we don't.

35:50.079 --> 35:52.481
But we do have to have a little chat

35:52.549 --> 35:54.783
with the deputy district attorney,

35:54.851 --> 35:56.051
<i>right, Lieutenant?</i>

35:56.119 --> 35:57.719
<i>Definitely.</i>

35:57.787 --> 35:59.867
<i>I mean, we get how terrible</i>
<i>this is for you, ma'am,</i>

35:59.868 --> 36:02.428
but we still need to arrest you
for murder in the first degree.

36:02.429 --> 36:06.261
And your husband could
very well find out about <i>that.</i>

36:06.329 --> 36:07.529
<i>No, I... wait!</i>

36:07.597 --> 36:09.665
<i>Wait! Listen!</i>
<i>He was threatening me!</i>

36:09.732 --> 36:11.266
What else could I have done?!

36:11.334 --> 36:13.869
You could have called the Las
Vegas police and turned him in.

36:13.937 --> 36:15.804
You could have told your husband,

36:15.872 --> 36:18.307
refused to go to a bar
with antifreeze in your purse,

36:18.375 --> 36:20.909
or maybe not have slept
with the guy to begin with.

36:20.977 --> 36:23.512
But you know what? That's not
really any of my business.

36:23.579 --> 36:26.381
But if I were you right now,
Mrs. Elkins,

36:26.449 --> 36:28.283
I would stop talking

36:28.351 --> 36:30.920
before you explain yourself onto death row.

36:32.323 --> 36:33.890
Don't get too excited back there, guys.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.458
<i>This is</i>
<i>pretty cut-and-dry,</i>

36:35.526 --> 36:38.294
<i>but I still have a deal to make</i>
<i>before we close shop.</i>

36:40.731 --> 36:42.498
Look out, Dr. Goof ball.

36:42.599 --> 36:43.866
You're next.

36:52.688 --> 36:56.077
See here's the best I can do
for you Professor Durban.

36:56.438 --> 36:58.060
We've looked over everything you've done

36:58.061 --> 36:59.941
in the state of California,
and we can't prove

37:00.009 --> 37:03.177
that you intended to
permanently deprive your <i>victims</i>

37:03.245 --> 37:05.346
of the money you <i>borrowed</i> from them.

37:05.413 --> 37:07.214
Which is what I said, so...

37:07.282 --> 37:09.649
So, since your more serious offenses

37:09.717 --> 37:11.951
appear to have occurred in Nevada...

37:12.019 --> 37:14.553
unh! Unh!
I was never in Nevada.

37:14.621 --> 37:15.921
It's time you went.

37:15.989 --> 37:18.029
So, if you will sign
these waivers of extradition,

37:18.030 --> 37:21.526
you can go with Detective Conner
here and you can see Las Vegas.

37:21.594 --> 37:22.908
And then you can deal with

37:22.909 --> 37:24.429
whatever charges they have against you

37:24.497 --> 37:25.798
the same way you did here.

37:25.865 --> 37:27.066
If I must.

37:28.468 --> 37:31.271
And please don't be too hard
on those young people I enlisted

37:31.338 --> 37:32.772
in this little laptop escapade.

37:32.840 --> 37:35.141
All they really got out of it
was good grades.

37:35.209 --> 37:36.510
Detective Conner,

37:36.577 --> 37:38.612
I look forward
to explaining Nevada law to you

37:38.680 --> 37:40.280
all the way back to your hometown.

37:40.348 --> 37:41.006
Hey, Conner.

37:41.131 --> 37:43.963
I'd say I felt sorry for you,
but you earned it.

37:50.258 --> 37:52.192
You know, I'd be willing to bet

37:52.260 --> 37:54.394
that he's able
to talk his way out of Nevada

37:54.462 --> 37:55.662
just like he did here.

37:55.730 --> 37:57.364
But then he still has to deal

37:57.432 --> 37:58.999
with all his outstanding warrants

37:59.067 --> 38:01.869
in, Illinois, Montana,
Kentucky, Florida, and Vermont.

38:01.937 --> 38:02.937
<i>You</i> caught him.

38:04.106 --> 38:05.626
Let someone else pay to prosecute him.

38:05.627 --> 38:06.747
And somewhere down the line,

38:06.748 --> 38:08.543
we'll find out who this Durban really is.

38:08.611 --> 38:10.779
People always give themselves away.

38:12.950 --> 38:14.283
Sooner or later.

38:38.075 --> 38:40.143
Rusty?

38:40.211 --> 38:42.412
Rusty, are you home?

38:45.950 --> 38:47.351
What happened?

38:47.452 --> 38:49.185
Can we talk about it in the morning?

38:49.253 --> 38:52.122
Is everything all right?

38:53.024 --> 38:55.025
Do I owe Daniel a call?

38:55.093 --> 38:57.194
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. I'm coming.

38:57.262 --> 39:00.464
Just... just don't freak out, okay?

39:03.502 --> 39:04.735
My God.

39:04.803 --> 39:07.071
Look, don't worry.
I-I didn't hit him back.

39:07.139 --> 39:10.408
I just ran, and I used the $100
you gave me to get a cab.

39:10.476 --> 39:12.877
My God. My God.
What did he do to you?

39:12.978 --> 39:16.181
Come up here and let me see you
in the light.

39:20.319 --> 39:22.053
What happened?

39:23.956 --> 39:26.658
Annie, his obnoxious fiancÃ©e,

39:26.726 --> 39:29.895
was asking me all these, like,
really personal questions

39:29.963 --> 39:34.200
about, like, how I'd
gotten along without my mother.

39:34.267 --> 39:35.668
And then I thought, you know, like,

39:35.735 --> 39:38.504
why not just get the whole
gay-hustling thing out there?

39:38.572 --> 39:41.040
And then when I did that,
Annie kind of freaked out.

39:41.108 --> 39:42.208
And then...

39:42.276 --> 39:43.810
Daniel took me outside to talk.

39:43.878 --> 39:46.318
And then he accused me of, like,
trying to ruin his wedding.

39:46.319 --> 39:49.079
And then I told him that I could
care less about his stupid wedding.

39:49.117 --> 39:51.552
And then...
then he hit me.

39:51.619 --> 39:53.421
Why didn't you call me?

39:53.489 --> 39:55.356
Because, Sharon, I knew you would be upset.

39:55.424 --> 39:57.224
And I wanted
to think things through, and...

39:57.225 --> 39:59.427
we're past the ice stage on my face.

39:59.495 --> 40:00.795
How can you be so sure?

40:00.863 --> 40:02.396
I'm sure.

40:04.266 --> 40:06.667
My,

40:06.735 --> 40:09.070
My mother's boyfriend used to do
this sort of thing to me

40:09.137 --> 40:10.404
like once a week.

40:13.208 --> 40:15.276
Until I beat the crap out <i>him.</i>

40:15.344 --> 40:17.077
And then, the next day,

40:17.145 --> 40:19.546
he and my mom dropped me off at the zoo.

40:23.618 --> 40:25.418
So now you know everything.

40:27.822 --> 40:30.957
Look, did I do anything
I need to apologize for?

40:31.025 --> 40:32.459
No.

40:32.526 --> 40:35.295
We are past the apology stage

40:35.363 --> 40:37.330
of our relationship
with Mr. Dunn,

40:37.398 --> 40:38.798
and we have moved on

40:38.866 --> 40:41.568
to the "please don't let me
drive over to his house"

40:41.636 --> 40:44.771
and shoot him in the head" phase.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.207
On the bright side,

40:48.229 --> 40:50.709
I guess I don't have to go back
to Daniel's house now, right?

40:52.212 --> 40:53.246
No.

40:53.314 --> 40:54.814
But there's a good chance

40:54.882 --> 40:57.250
that he's going to come over here.

40:57.318 --> 40:59.552
Wait a minute.

40:59.620 --> 41:01.423
Before I put this stuff on your bottom lip,

41:02.447 --> 41:03.702

41:13.370 --> 41:14.337
One more.

41:17.575 --> 41:20.377
