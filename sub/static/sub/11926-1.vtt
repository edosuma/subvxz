00:50.383 --> 00:52.384
It is the dawn of the 17th century.

00:54.345 --> 00:56.221
After the assassination of his father,

00:56.306 --> 00:59.683
the young King Louis XIII
ascends to the French throne.

01:01.728 --> 01:05.480
His once peaceful nation
is surrounded by enemies on all sides.

01:08.777 --> 01:12.696
Within the borders of France itself,
Cardinal Richelieu, the King's advisor,

01:12.781 --> 01:15.365
plots in secret to seize power for himself.

01:16.034 --> 01:19.078
The inexperienced Louis
and his new bride, Queen Anne,

01:19.162 --> 01:21.246
find themselves without a single friend.

01:21.664 --> 01:24.208
Europe is a powder keg waiting to explode

01:24.292 --> 01:26.919
in a war that will engulf
the entire continent.

01:27.796 --> 01:31.090
And only a few men
can prevent the coming apocalypse.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.985
Move out!

02:36.614 --> 02:37.698
Halt!

02:59.929 --> 03:01.096
Don't.

03:01.764 --> 03:02.890
Getting careless?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.517
The feeling is mutual.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.612
For future reference, "I love you"
would have been a more suitable reply.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.950
Could have just said, "Hello."

03:22.035 --> 03:23.994
What would be the fun in that?

03:24.120 --> 03:26.788
- How was the bishop?
- Not as good as you.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.707
You are incorrigible.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.127
I bet you say that to all the girls.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.841
But, sir! Remember I am a lady!

03:37.967 --> 03:39.051
Let me touch your bosom.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.802
Sir, keep your hands to yourself!

03:41.804 --> 03:44.514
Hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come,

03:44.682 --> 03:47.809
thy will be done, on earth
as it is in heaven.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.686
Give us this day our daily bread,

03:50.063 --> 03:51.647
and forgive us our trespasses,

03:51.731 --> 03:54.316
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.359
Amen.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.032
That's enough wine, I can assure...

04:17.548 --> 04:19.466
- What?
- Key.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.810
You mean this key?

04:39.445 --> 04:40.529
Who are you?

04:47.203 --> 04:49.913
- I'm not a priest.
- I'm not really a lady.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.373
I have 10 minutes.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.795
♪ There once was an aunt from Lorraine.

04:56.879 --> 05:00.048
♪ With an incredible tolerance for pain.

05:00.091 --> 05:04.261
♪ She had a nasty habit
♪ Involving a chicken, a frog, and a rabbit

05:04.345 --> 05:07.222
I expected more
from a man of your reputation.

05:08.516 --> 05:12.352
I don't suppose you have any idea
where I could find Athos and Aramis?

05:14.689 --> 05:16.898
Never heard of them.

05:18.109 --> 05:22.571
You French spies.
You're very, very arrogant. And foolish.

05:22.655 --> 05:23.780
And you're so...

05:23.865 --> 05:25.240
Sexy?

05:26.075 --> 05:27.951
Lt's a wonder it took me so long
to catch you.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.619
You didn't!

05:29.746 --> 05:30.787
I beg your pardon?

05:32.415 --> 05:34.750
You didn't catch me.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.377
And what exactly are you doing here?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.129
Catching you.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.110
Key.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.949
Vive la France!

06:09.827 --> 06:11.453
Da Vinci's Vault.

06:12.121 --> 06:15.957
Leonardo designed it to protect
the plans of his greatest inventions.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.133
Shall we?

06:30.932 --> 06:31.973
Now.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.453
Your part's done. Why don't you stay back?
We'll meet at the rally point.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.330
We came together,

06:56.499 --> 06:58.333
we leave together.

07:20.648 --> 07:21.648
I'll go.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.066
Wait, wait.

07:23.734 --> 07:24.901
Too easy.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.881
- Pressure plates under the floor.
- Oh!

07:46.340 --> 07:48.717
- I could scale the walls.
- Run a cable along the roof.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.052
- Could be booby-trapped, too.
- Hmm.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.415
Well? We don't have all night.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.086
You're absolutely certain
there are no hidden passages?

08:25.129 --> 08:26.254
And no secret tunnels?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.089
Positive, sir. lt's a vault.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.633
One way in, one way out.

08:29.759 --> 08:33.929
Excellent! I want these Musketeers dead!
I want them dead!

08:33.971 --> 08:36.515
The guards change in two minutes,
maybe less.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.517
Less!

08:43.731 --> 08:44.773
What now?

08:44.857 --> 08:46.733
- C'est la vie?
- No.

08:47.818 --> 08:48.985
Contingency plan.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.448
Got it.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.792
Athos, you do know what's up there?

09:03.834 --> 09:05.585
Just hold your breath.

09:21.644 --> 09:22.811
Get out!

09:22.853 --> 09:25.522
Hey! Get back down there! Now!

09:37.952 --> 09:39.452
Go ahead, say it!

09:39.495 --> 09:40.495
I love you.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.875
I hate to ruin the mood,
but perhaps we could go elsewhere?

09:46.002 --> 09:49.004
You know, for once I think
the padre may be right.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.469
All for one.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.138
And one for all.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.518
So, what's next?

10:03.853 --> 10:05.270
Back to Paris, I guess.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.688
And then what?

10:06.856 --> 10:09.190
Wherever they send us,
whatever France needs.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.359
Lt's who we are. lt's what we do.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.071
I do love you.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.323
I know.

10:16.657 --> 10:19.993
Then please try and understand
that this isn't personal.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.162
Lt's strictly business.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.373
He made me a better offer.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.051
Ah! Athos.

10:36.677 --> 10:37.844
Buckingham.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.521
A toxin.

10:51.400 --> 10:56.071
In case you were wondering, it wasn't
in your drink, it was on your cup.

10:56.197 --> 10:59.741
Inactive until it came into contact
with the liquid.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.746
Don't worry.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.749
Lt isn't fatal.

11:09.293 --> 11:12.128
Although I suspect
a part of you wishes it was.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.383
You take all the risk and I get the reward.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.927
Hardly seems fair.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.806
Well, just so you don't leave empty-handed,

11:22.932 --> 11:24.641
a word of advice.

11:29.230 --> 11:32.565
Trust no one, especially women.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.069
You'll live longer.

11:43.244 --> 11:47.247
Telling him you loved him
right before you betrayed him.

11:48.124 --> 11:52.460
I must say, that was cruel,
even by my standards.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.172
I only took away his prize.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.800
You took a lot more than that.

12:08.477 --> 12:11.855
At last, the war machine.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.355
Look down.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.526
Lt's a trick an old friend taught me.

12:59.403 --> 13:03.323
Your adversary will not always be
as noble as you.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.366
Remember that,

13:06.410 --> 13:08.369
and I have nothing left to teach you.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.537
I doubt that, Father.

13:12.666 --> 13:13.875
Keep it.

13:14.877 --> 13:18.755
Lt's passed down from generation
to generation, from father to son.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.381
Lt's yours now.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.096
The weapon of a Musketeer.

13:27.431 --> 13:29.557
The real weapon of a Musketeer

13:30.351 --> 13:31.601
is here.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.770
All for one.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.563
And one for all.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.857
You remind me of somebody.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.984
Let me guess. You.

13:40.486 --> 13:44.572
No, no.
The man I wish I was when I was your age.

13:46.408 --> 13:49.327
Well, you should really be on your way.

13:50.329 --> 13:54.749
Take this purse. There's 1 5 crowns in it.
Lt's enough to get you to Paris.

13:54.959 --> 13:59.254
And you'll need a mount.
Your mother's insisting you take Buttercup.

13:59.421 --> 14:02.257
- I know it's not much, and...
- It's plenty.

14:07.596 --> 14:10.974
Take care of yourself, my son.
Try not to get into any fights.

14:11.058 --> 14:15.436
If I'm to be a Musketeer, I think I might
have to do a little bit of fighting.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.605
Stay at the back if you can.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.315
Yes, Mother.

14:19.775 --> 14:23.444
- There's one more piece of advice.
- I know, I know. Don't get into any trouble.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.779
Wrong.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.322
Get into trouble.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.241
Make mistakes.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.161
Fight, love, live.

14:34.164 --> 14:39.127
And remember, always,
you're a Gascon and our son.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.173
Now go. Go.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.214
In the name of God,
what kind of beast is that?

15:25.716 --> 15:28.176
And the beast he's riding
doesn't look much either.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.636
- Ostler.
- Sir?

15:29.803 --> 15:31.971
- Please see that my horse is watered and fed.
- Oh!

15:32.139 --> 15:33.890
Lt's a horse, is it?

15:34.266 --> 15:36.351
My friends here thought it was a cow.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.313
Excuse me.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.858
See, I know you men
are just kidding around.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.610
Buttercup,

15:46.612 --> 15:49.072
well, she gets a little sensitive.

15:50.532 --> 15:52.617
I'm afraid I must ask you to apologize.

15:53.619 --> 15:57.205
Well, I'm afraid I'm not in the habit
of apologizing to Gascon yokels.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.082
Not to me.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.167
To my horse.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.172
You've hurt her feelings.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.135
And if I don't?

16:11.762 --> 16:13.346
I shall have to kill you.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.192
You shot me!

16:26.527 --> 16:28.736
Most observant of you, young man.

16:28.904 --> 16:31.739
But the real question is,
why are you not dead?

16:33.242 --> 16:34.701
Flesh wound.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.079
Sight must be off.
Who takes care of my pistols?

16:38.372 --> 16:39.872
Captain Rochefort, I...

16:43.585 --> 16:44.919
Whoa, whoa, steady.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.046
Wouldn't want to dirty my blade
with peasant blood.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.757
So, boy,

16:50.175 --> 16:51.718
consider this a lesson.

16:51.885 --> 16:52.885
Your last.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.430
No.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.561
He's too pretty for that.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.064
As you wish, Milady.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.943
Rochefort, come.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.069
We're expected in Paris.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.446
Thank you.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.277
Make way!

18:40.244 --> 18:41.869
I think you've had enough.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.248
Where's my tankard?

18:46.416 --> 18:47.875
Excuse me!

18:50.546 --> 18:51.879
You think you're better than me?

18:52.047 --> 18:53.548
No.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.133
Watch yourself, boy!

18:55.384 --> 18:57.135
All for one.

18:57.719 --> 18:59.178
Excuse me!

19:00.222 --> 19:02.140
- Sorry! I'm sorry!
- Are you blind?

19:02.307 --> 19:04.225
Look, I'm chasing after a man
who insulted my horse

19:04.309 --> 19:05.518
and tried to kill me, so let me go!

19:05.561 --> 19:08.229
That's not good enough.
You spilled my drink and ruined my shirt.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.814
I'm in a hurry.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.902
- Here.
- 1 0 sous?

19:15.237 --> 19:18.364
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- The town drunk, from the smell of you.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.867
Now that, my boy, is fighting talk.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.996
- What are you saying exactly?
- Blind and deaf.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.373
Fortunately for you,
I'm somewhat of a doctor.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.250
Great! When can you fit me in?

19:29.960 --> 19:32.003
12:00, Cooper's Yard, St. Germain.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.254
I'll be there.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.258
Excuse me!

19:37.342 --> 19:39.302
I just can't decide.

19:39.386 --> 19:43.723
Well, if I might point out,
this does make you look very dignified,

19:43.807 --> 19:47.101
whereas the blue one
brings out your dashing side.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.811
Equally important.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.315
Dignified. Dashing.

19:52.941 --> 19:56.110
In the words of King
Solomon, I'll take both!

19:56.236 --> 19:58.237
A most excellent choice, sir.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.617
Darling, you spoil me.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.952
I don't know how I shall ever repay you.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.705
- Watch yourself!
- My apologies.

20:08.123 --> 20:10.499
Matter of life and death. Won't happen
again. Believe you dropped this.

20:11.960 --> 20:12.960
This isn't mine.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.712
I saw the lady hand this to you,
I'm not blind.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.673
Are you implying that
I take money from this woman?

20:17.799 --> 20:20.301
Are you saying that I cannot afford to pay
for my own wardrobe?

20:20.385 --> 20:22.845
Do you know who I am?

20:23.013 --> 20:24.055
No!

20:24.139 --> 20:25.473
Then we're even.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.310
You're in luck, boy.

20:29.478 --> 20:33.481
Ordinarily, I would slaughter you on the
spot, but this is a brand-new jacket.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.859
Cooper's Yard, St. Germain, 1:00.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.403
I suggest you dress for a funeral!

20:39.821 --> 20:40.905
What?

20:51.166 --> 20:53.584
- Lottery!
- There you go.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.087
Lottery ticket, sir?
Might be your lucky day!

21:02.552 --> 21:03.844
What the hell?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.013
5 francs?

21:07.057 --> 21:08.140
Hey! Hey!

21:09.184 --> 21:10.393
What is this?

21:10.936 --> 21:12.353
Lt's a citation.

21:13.855 --> 21:15.189
Lt's a ticket.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.359
Failure to remove animal bowel movements
from public area.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.527
French.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.947
Your horse took a dump on the street.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.366
You're joking.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.910
That's what they all say.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.870
You know what?

21:32.874 --> 21:35.626
Cooper's Yard, St. Germain, 2:00.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.048
Strange boy.

22:02.237 --> 22:03.237
Milady de Winter!

22:21.465 --> 22:23.007
Close game, Your Eminence.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.842
- Hmm.
- Who's the opponent?

22:24.926 --> 22:28.262
Myself. No one else proved to be
a sufficient challenge.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.103
Hmm.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.438
What news of England?

22:38.482 --> 22:39.940
He's coming.

22:40.734 --> 22:41.942
- Buckingham?
- Hmm.

22:42.944 --> 22:43.944
And...

22:44.321 --> 22:45.321
And?

22:46.948 --> 22:48.324
He built it.

22:48.950 --> 22:50.242
The war machine.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.036
And he doesn't question your loyalty.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.247
He thinks he's so cunning.

22:55.957 --> 22:57.416
So evil.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.460
Evil is just a point of view.

23:00.670 --> 23:01.712
Ah!

23:01.797 --> 23:02.797
Richelieu.

23:08.470 --> 23:09.929
Is this lady the emissary from England?

23:10.097 --> 23:12.264
Your Majesty is exceptionally alert.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.811
So, madam,

23:18.980 --> 23:20.064
what of Buckingham?

23:21.817 --> 23:22.817
Majesty?

23:22.901 --> 23:24.985
Well, what's he wearing these days?

23:26.988 --> 23:28.697
Green, Your Majesty.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.492
- Green?
- Hmm.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.702
Very interesting.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.830
And you had the gall to recommend blue?

23:37.207 --> 23:38.332
Of course it should be green.

23:38.375 --> 23:42.545
Why am I surrounded
by incompetent idiots?

23:44.172 --> 23:45.965
Green, green, green!

23:46.007 --> 23:48.300
Do I have to do everything myself?

23:59.563 --> 24:00.604
Ah!

24:00.689 --> 24:03.732
There you are. Shall we get to it?

24:04.192 --> 24:06.527
So, are you eager
to meet your maker?

24:06.778 --> 24:08.070
I have other appointments.

24:08.363 --> 24:09.780
You'll miss them, I'm afraid.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.241
Well, I'll try my best to be on time.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.076
My seconds.

24:14.244 --> 24:15.244
You!

24:16.037 --> 24:17.079
You're fighting this rascal?

24:18.874 --> 24:20.541
My appointments.

24:21.042 --> 24:23.544
1:00. 2:00.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.089
How long have you been in Paris?

24:27.257 --> 24:29.133
- Arrived this morning.
- You have been busy.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.386
Patience is not one of my virtues.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.679
Well, neither are good manners.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.056
Wait for your turn, old man.

24:38.643 --> 24:41.812
What would you like me to put
on your headstone? "Little shit"?

24:42.647 --> 24:45.816
D'Artagnan.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.152
I'm Athos.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.904
This is Porthos and Aramis.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.283
The Three Musketeers.

24:54.743 --> 24:55.743
I've heard of you.

24:56.786 --> 25:00.414
From my father, a Musketeer himself.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.333
In fact, I came to Paris to be one of you.

25:02.417 --> 25:03.834
I'm afraid you're a little late.

25:04.586 --> 25:05.628
What happened?

25:05.712 --> 25:07.922
Oh, a bad mission. Budget cuts.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.840
Cardinal, progress.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.300
Take your pick.

25:12.844 --> 25:15.471
Well, then, welcome to Paris.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.264
Pity we'll have to kill you.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.978
Well, if I can't become a Musketeer,
I might as well fight one.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.522
Or three.

25:25.315 --> 25:28.526
Kill him already.
Lt's lunchtime and I'm starving.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.246
Halt!

25:43.458 --> 25:44.458
Jussac.

25:45.252 --> 25:49.255
Well, well, well.
How the mighty have fallen.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.423
Dueling in defiance of the edicts?

25:52.217 --> 25:54.718
You got tired of rolling peddlers
for spare change?

25:56.137 --> 25:57.972
- Now...
- Seal the square!

25:58.390 --> 26:01.934
Surrender your weapons
and come along with us.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.060
Seal it off!

26:03.270 --> 26:06.730
Unless, of course, you would rather resist.

26:06.898 --> 26:07.898
New plan.

26:08.358 --> 26:12.236
Kill the boy, kick their asses,
and then go get some lunch.

26:12.445 --> 26:14.029
I could do with some exercise.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.288
Seal it off, boys!

26:22.998 --> 26:24.039
You were saying?

26:24.791 --> 26:28.627
On the other hand,
discretion is the better part of valor.

26:28.795 --> 26:30.004
You're the Musketeers.

26:30.213 --> 26:31.297
Wrong.

26:31.590 --> 26:35.092
We were the Musketeers.
Now we're just...us.

26:49.357 --> 26:50.691
Rochefort.

27:38.657 --> 27:39.698
Shall we?

27:57.425 --> 27:59.051
Finish them off.

28:02.722 --> 28:03.847
Let's even the odds.

29:08.663 --> 29:09.747
Enjoying the show?

29:10.248 --> 29:11.373
- You!
- Watch out!

29:29.017 --> 29:30.684
You didn't
answer my question.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.019
Are you always this cocky?

29:32.812 --> 29:33.812
Only on Tuesdays

29:38.193 --> 29:39.693
and whenever beautiful women are involved.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.196
Damn you!

29:46.075 --> 29:47.951
Can't you see
we're trying to have a conversation?

30:04.219 --> 30:05.886
What is your name?

30:07.263 --> 30:08.555
Constance.

30:09.349 --> 30:12.267
Constance. Sounds very steadfast.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.603
A quality you seem to know little about.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.355
Oh, I beg to differ.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.233
Deep down, I am a hopeless romantic.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.235
Back for more?

30:32.288 --> 30:35.791
Musketeers! Musketeers! Musketeers!

30:38.962 --> 30:41.088
I'd forgotten what it feels like.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.048
We all have.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.803
The name is D'Artagnan.

30:49.222 --> 30:50.973
You must come from a very small town.

30:51.224 --> 30:52.266
How did you know?

30:52.433 --> 30:54.726
Lines like yours
might actually work there.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.771
This is Paris.
I suggest you stick to swordplay.

30:58.481 --> 31:02.568
In the battle of wits,
you, sir, are unarmed.

31:08.575 --> 31:09.741
She's right, lad.

31:09.909 --> 31:13.161
The ladies of Paris
are infinitely more complicated.

31:13.329 --> 31:16.498
They have 1,000 ways of saying, "No,"
and only some of them mean, "Yes."

31:16.624 --> 31:18.417
I hate to ruin the mood,
but they will be back.

31:18.459 --> 31:21.420
And unless you wish to
fight an entire army.

31:23.923 --> 31:25.299
Elsewhere.

31:29.637 --> 31:32.764
So, now what?
Do we pick up where we left off?

31:32.932 --> 31:34.892
I think there's been enough fighting
for one day.

31:35.059 --> 31:38.478
Besides, any man who's an enemy
of Rochefort is a friend of mine.

31:38.605 --> 31:39.646
Who's Rochefort?

31:39.731 --> 31:41.982
Captain of the Cardinal's guards.

31:42.066 --> 31:44.443
The right hand of the most powerful man
in France.

31:44.485 --> 31:46.862
Rochefort is the most feared swordsman
in Europe.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.823
You certainly know how to pick your fights.

31:49.991 --> 31:52.910
Like I said, he insulted my horse.

31:54.829 --> 31:58.665
You're reckless,
arrogant, impetuous,

31:58.833 --> 32:01.835
probably be dead by sundown,
but I like you, lad.

32:03.838 --> 32:06.089
- Where are you staying?
- No idea.

32:06.257 --> 32:08.091
Ah! Do you have any money?

32:11.512 --> 32:12.679
Well, good sir,

32:12.847 --> 32:17.184
you and your fine steed
are welcome in our humble home.

32:18.478 --> 32:19.811
For the time being.

32:20.647 --> 32:23.273
That goes in there.

32:25.860 --> 32:27.194
Come on.

32:28.696 --> 32:30.322
What shall we drink to?

32:31.699 --> 32:32.783
How about the King?

32:32.867 --> 32:37.663
He's a child. Cardinal rules in all
but name, might as well drink to him.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.707
To France.

32:40.875 --> 32:44.544
We served it, fought for it and bled for it.
Look where it got us.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.296
Friendship? Love?

32:46.923 --> 32:50.550
Word of advice, boy.
Trust no one.

32:52.553 --> 32:55.055
Must be something you still believe in.

32:55.765 --> 32:59.059
This.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.561
And this.

33:04.524 --> 33:07.609
Anyone who tells you otherwise is either
a fool or trying to sell you something.

33:14.909 --> 33:19.746
I know Athos may seem cold and unfriendly,
but don't let it fool you.

33:20.248 --> 33:23.583
- Deep down...
- He really is cold and unfriendly.

33:24.377 --> 33:25.711
What happened to him?

33:26.045 --> 33:29.089
What happens to any man, a woman.

33:30.633 --> 33:33.051
You know, I don't want to offend anybody,

33:34.804 --> 33:38.432
but I thought you'd all be
a little bit more...heroic.

33:42.437 --> 33:45.105
What my esteemed colleague
was trying to say, in his own way,

33:45.189 --> 33:47.566
is that we are obsolete.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.820
We're warriors,
but there's no war for us to fight.

33:52.488 --> 33:56.283
And so we drink and brawl
and quarrel with the Cardinal's guards

33:56.367 --> 33:58.201
and then we drink some more.

33:59.620 --> 34:02.122
What we need is a great cause.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.625
But there are no great causes left.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.587
Which is why I keep telling you it's not
too late to do that priest thing again.

34:08.629 --> 34:09.838
Beats working for the city.

34:10.172 --> 34:13.132
Free booze at wakes and weddings.
And then there's the nuns.

34:13.676 --> 34:14.842
You were a priest?

34:15.011 --> 34:17.054
Until I realized being a man of God

34:17.138 --> 34:19.473
and a man of the cloth
aren't always the same thing.

34:19.974 --> 34:22.893
And yet, he still says prayers
for those he kills.

34:22.976 --> 34:25.020
- Old habit.
- On the contrary.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.647
The men I kill deserve to die.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.150
But they also deserve peace.

34:30.193 --> 34:32.527
After all, they must have believed
in something.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.822
We all do. Even the worst of us.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.033
I'll drink to that!

34:39.659 --> 34:41.411
Planchet! More wine!

34:43.331 --> 34:44.664
Planchet!

34:45.166 --> 34:46.875
Sorry, sirs.

34:48.168 --> 34:49.168
I'm afraid

34:50.338 --> 34:52.255
there's none left. You've drunk the lot.

34:52.422 --> 34:53.672
What sort of answer's that?

34:54.382 --> 34:56.134
Well, go get some more, man!

34:56.302 --> 34:58.512
Very good, sir. It's just, I can't, sir.

35:00.473 --> 35:01.848
We've run out of money.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.353
Planchet, what are you?

35:06.729 --> 35:09.064
- Complete and utter waste of space, sir?
- And?

35:09.190 --> 35:11.358
- As much use as a fart in a bottle, sir?
- Right.

35:11.567 --> 35:14.736
In short, sir, a total tit, sir.
But I can't work bleeding miracles!

35:15.655 --> 35:16.863
Planchet?

35:18.741 --> 35:19.866
Oh!

35:22.620 --> 35:23.954
Thank you very much, sir!

35:24.163 --> 35:28.041
That's incredibly generous
from such a handsome, young man.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.210
Thank you very, very much.

35:30.336 --> 35:32.420
Will you be staying here tonight?

35:32.588 --> 35:33.839
He'll be taking your bed, Planchet.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.343
Right, and so I'll be sleeping...

35:38.386 --> 35:39.886
You may take the balcony.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.347
Outside? The balcony outside in the cold?

35:42.515 --> 35:45.392
With birds shitting on my head all night?

35:45.768 --> 35:47.269
Great, can I just say you...

35:47.436 --> 35:48.728
Wine! Wine!

35:48.896 --> 35:52.065
- Wine! Wine! Wine! Wine!
- Yes! Of course! Wine it is, sirs!

36:14.630 --> 36:15.630
Check.

36:15.882 --> 36:18.300
This is a ridiculous game.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.011
Surely the King
should be the most powerful piece?

36:21.220 --> 36:23.847
The King is the most important piece.

36:23.931 --> 36:26.349
But he's vulnerable, he needs protection.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.643
May I suggest you castle him?

36:36.444 --> 36:37.944
Checkmate.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.160
There. What do you think of that?

36:46.120 --> 36:48.788
Your Majesty is a force of nature.

36:49.457 --> 36:52.709
- Took you by surprise, eh?
- Yes, indeed, you did.

36:55.129 --> 36:57.297
May we speak a little about foreign policy?

36:57.715 --> 37:00.926
- It's not about Buckingham, is it?
- Oh, I'm afraid it is.

37:01.677 --> 37:03.887
He's arriving in Paris tomorrow.

37:04.055 --> 37:08.266
His master, King James, has agreed
to hear our peace proposal.

37:08.851 --> 37:12.938
Good, good. Well, he knows better
than to mess with me, then.

37:13.397 --> 37:14.397
There's also another matter.

37:15.274 --> 37:17.525
A dangerous rivalry has sprung

37:17.652 --> 37:20.195
between Your Majesty's Musketeers
and my personal guards.

37:20.655 --> 37:21.863
Who was involved?

37:22.323 --> 37:25.200
Athos, Porthos, Aramis.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.827
The usual suspects.

37:27.995 --> 37:30.413
And a young man called D'Artagnan.

37:31.165 --> 37:36.002
I have summoned them to the palace so that
Your Majesty can punish them severely.

37:56.232 --> 37:58.066
His Majesty, the King!

37:58.776 --> 38:00.360
Well, well, well.

38:03.406 --> 38:05.407
Brawling with the Cardinal's guards.

38:05.908 --> 38:07.409
That's very bad.

38:07.868 --> 38:09.536
What have you got to say for yourselves?

38:09.870 --> 38:13.164
- We...
- Humbly beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

38:13.332 --> 38:15.709
Yes.
Yes, I should hope so, too.

38:16.210 --> 38:19.087
So, tell me, how many
were involved in the altercation?

38:19.672 --> 38:22.882
There were four of us against 40 of them,
Your Majesty.

38:23.509 --> 38:24.551
Four against 40?

38:27.638 --> 38:29.556
And you beat them like a drum?

38:29.807 --> 38:32.767
And, yes, you shall have to be reprimanded,
of course,

38:32.852 --> 38:34.602
most harshly, I'm afraid.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.230
- You do understand that, don't you?
- We do, Your Majesty.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.398
Her Majesty, the Queen.

38:46.282 --> 38:47.365
Anne.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.826
What a... What a pleasant surprise!

38:50.745 --> 38:53.246
My ladies and I wanted to see
the valiant Musketeers

38:53.331 --> 38:55.040
who stood against the Cardinal's guards.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.751
Four against 40?

38:57.793 --> 38:59.002
Or was it 400?

39:00.421 --> 39:02.005
Just 40, Your Majesty.

39:02.256 --> 39:03.631
Lt was an off day.

39:04.842 --> 39:06.343
That's my Musketeers for you.

39:06.427 --> 39:09.179
By the time they write songs about them,
it'll be 4,000.

39:09.263 --> 39:10.764
I hope you won't be too harsh with them.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.059
After all, boys will be boys.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.107
You must be D'Artagnan.

39:22.234 --> 39:26.446
My lady in waiting has told me about
how brave and dashing you were yesterday.

39:27.114 --> 39:29.324
But you must try not to be so reckless.

39:29.408 --> 39:30.784
Can't help myself, Your Majesty.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.286
- Your Majesty, the culprits.
- Ah! Yes, yes.

39:35.831 --> 39:36.915
Well, stand up, then.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.215
Athos.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.300
Porthos.

39:47.968 --> 39:49.302
Aramis.

39:51.889 --> 39:56.810
Forgive me for saying this, D'Artagnan,
but you do look a little underdressed.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.397
My father is a poor man, Your Majesty.

40:00.981 --> 40:03.191
A former Musketeer as well.

40:03.651 --> 40:06.027
These are the only clothes I have.

40:07.029 --> 40:09.155
Oh, Lord.
We shall have to rectify that.

40:09.573 --> 40:13.660
Can't have my Musketeers,
or the son of one, looking like tramps.

40:14.912 --> 40:17.455
New suits all around, I think.

40:18.207 --> 40:20.917
Yes. You'll see to that, Cardinal?

40:21.168 --> 40:25.630
And, yes, I think a purse of gold for each
as a reward for your courage.

40:25.714 --> 40:27.257
You'll see to that as well, Cardinal.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.259
And, yes, before I forget,

40:29.343 --> 40:32.137
no more fighting
with His Eminence's guards.

40:32.513 --> 40:33.596
Hmm?

40:36.642 --> 40:38.351
Or there'll be none of them left.

40:40.896 --> 40:42.856
Your Majesty, might I suggest a more...

40:42.940 --> 40:44.858
Forgive my impudence, Cardinal,

40:45.025 --> 40:47.402
but I doubt the King
requires your advice in this matter.

40:47.486 --> 40:49.654
After all, they are his Musketeers.

40:50.197 --> 40:51.197
Good day, gentlemen.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.581
Well, now,
off with you rascals.

41:00.207 --> 41:05.003
But be there for the parade tomorrow.
New suits and all.

41:06.922 --> 41:08.923
I tire of these royal children.

41:09.884 --> 41:12.218
Lt's time to make our move.

41:12.845 --> 41:16.181
We shall use Buckingham's arrival
to our advantage.

41:16.348 --> 41:18.266
During his visit, we will reveal

41:18.434 --> 41:21.811
that he arranged a secret rendezvous
with the Queen.

41:21.979 --> 41:25.398
May I inquire how Your Eminence
has uncovered this scandalous affair?

41:25.483 --> 41:30.111
By reading Buckingham's letters
to the Queen, found in her possession.

41:30.279 --> 41:33.198
Written in Buckingham's hand,
then authenticated by his seal?

41:33.741 --> 41:37.076
A woman of your talents
should have no trouble procuring either.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.746
Hmm. Your Eminence is too kind.

41:39.830 --> 41:42.081
However, I doubt that the King
will accept such letters

41:42.166 --> 41:45.627
as definitive proof of
his wife's indiscretion.

41:46.629 --> 41:50.048
Then we shall provide him
with something a bit more substantial.

41:50.216 --> 41:54.886
A piece of the Queen's jewelry given
to Buckingham as a token of affection.

41:54.929 --> 41:57.096
Buckingham will be humiliated.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.640
The King will be outraged.

41:58.766 --> 42:01.267
The Queen will be executed.

42:01.685 --> 42:04.687
France will have no
choice but to go to war.

42:05.523 --> 42:10.068
And in times like these, France will
naturally turn to a stronger leader.

42:11.278 --> 42:16.324
Someone better equipped to rule a nation
than a cuckolded teenager with a grudge.

42:17.117 --> 42:18.159
Hmm.

42:20.496 --> 42:22.914
Someone like Your Eminence.

42:34.468 --> 42:37.136
About face!

42:54.029 --> 42:57.657
Well, where is he, then?
Lt's just appalling manners.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.640
Drop anchor!

43:23.017 --> 43:24.100
Anchor aweigh!

43:38.866 --> 43:40.366
Damn his impudence!

43:41.493 --> 43:44.203
What is that thing called
anyway, Richelieu?

43:44.705 --> 43:46.873
An airship, Your Majesty.

43:53.756 --> 43:56.799
- Why don't I have one of those?
- An oversight on our part.

43:56.884 --> 44:00.136
Right, right. Well, build me one.

44:14.693 --> 44:16.069
Secure the lines!

44:16.528 --> 44:17.987
All lines secured!

44:35.714 --> 44:36.964
Buckingham.

44:39.426 --> 44:40.510
Blue.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.012
Oh.

44:48.018 --> 44:49.644
Your Majesty.

44:51.063 --> 44:52.271
Love the outfit.

44:52.606 --> 44:54.023
Very retro.

44:54.191 --> 44:55.525
We were all wearing those in London,

44:56.110 --> 44:59.862
when was it, last year or the year before?

45:01.281 --> 45:05.034
Lord Buckingham, I trust your journey
wasn't too uncomfortable.

45:05.119 --> 45:06.953
Not at all. No.

45:07.079 --> 45:08.287
On the contrary.

45:08.455 --> 45:12.333
Handles like a dream and keeps me
one step closer to heaven.

45:13.127 --> 45:14.627
Cardinal.

45:19.299 --> 45:23.970
Of course, being a servant of God,
you have no need for such crude devices.

45:25.305 --> 45:28.307
King James is most eager
to hear your peace proposal.

45:28.392 --> 45:30.143
- Lord Buckingham.
- Anne.

45:30.728 --> 45:31.728
Your Majesty.

45:32.396 --> 45:36.315
I must say your beauty is far more radiant
than I remember.

45:36.400 --> 45:37.942
You've met before?

45:38.110 --> 45:39.527
A long time ago.

45:39.611 --> 45:42.572
An evening I shall cherish forever.

45:44.408 --> 45:46.159
Right. Well, shall we?

45:50.998 --> 45:52.915
Now this is a pleasant surprise.

45:54.001 --> 45:55.793
Another acquaintance of yours, I see.

45:56.211 --> 45:57.670
We've met, yes.

45:57.838 --> 46:01.758
As I recall, last I saw you,
you were on your knees as well.

46:02.384 --> 46:04.552
Most unfortunate habit.

46:04.762 --> 46:07.346
Lt's a habit I shall have to break
during our next encounter.

46:08.974 --> 46:10.850
I look forward to it.

46:11.643 --> 46:14.020
In the meantime, shall we talk peace?

46:19.735 --> 46:22.904
You must pass me the name
of your interior decorator.

46:23.572 --> 46:24.572
Wine?

46:25.032 --> 46:26.199
I don't drink.

46:26.784 --> 46:29.994
What about that rather nice bottle of
Bordeaux in your middle left-hand drawer?

46:31.079 --> 46:33.831
You must pass me the name
of your spy in the palace.

46:34.666 --> 46:36.334
And yours in mine.

46:39.046 --> 46:41.672
England cannot afford a war on two fronts.

46:41.840 --> 46:44.383
Both our nations
are stretched to breaking point.

46:44.468 --> 46:48.554
A peace treaty would be
of immense strategic advantage.

46:48.722 --> 46:51.015
Whose advantage? Yours?

46:51.099 --> 46:52.099
Ours.

46:53.185 --> 46:58.231
I have a feeling my new war machines
will readdress the balance.

47:00.776 --> 47:02.401
Very impressive.

47:03.570 --> 47:08.491
And march!
Left, left, left, right, left!

47:12.037 --> 47:13.621
Hold your line!

47:13.872 --> 47:14.872
Halt!

47:14.957 --> 47:16.749
About face!

47:18.961 --> 47:20.086
Stay where you are!

47:20.170 --> 47:22.255
This is the Queen's wing.
You can't be up here.

47:22.422 --> 47:23.673
Oh, thank goodness.

47:23.841 --> 47:28.135
I got so lost. I took a wrong turn
and then a door slammed behind me.

47:28.387 --> 47:32.682
I've been trapped up here, in the sun,
in this heat.

47:32.933 --> 47:35.017
- It's going to be all right.
- Oh, I'm gonna faint.

47:35.102 --> 47:37.395
- You're in safe hands.
- Thank you.

47:37.646 --> 47:38.938
And march!

48:01.003 --> 48:02.003
Halt!

48:02.629 --> 48:05.214
You can't shoot. They'll hear you.

48:05.465 --> 48:06.591
Shh!

48:07.342 --> 48:08.634
Wait for it!

48:18.312 --> 48:19.979
Left, left!

48:21.982 --> 48:25.067
Constance! Constance!
Hey, hey, excuse me!

48:25.819 --> 48:27.737
Pardon, Your Majesty.

48:27.905 --> 48:29.739
This will only take a moment.

48:31.992 --> 48:33.659
What are you doing here?

48:33.827 --> 48:36.704
His Majesty wants a word with me.
Imagine that.

48:36.872 --> 48:39.206
Yes, lovely. Now, excuse me.

48:39.374 --> 48:40.458
I was...

48:40.626 --> 48:45.046
I was thinking, after I'm finished
with His Majesty, maybe we could talk?

48:45.130 --> 48:46.881
I can't. I have plans.

48:46.965 --> 48:47.965
What about tomorrow?

48:48.091 --> 48:49.091
I have a lot of plans.

48:49.217 --> 48:50.801
- Well, I...
- Look, D'Artagnan.

48:50.844 --> 48:53.846
You may have a new set of clothes
and the King's favor,

48:54.014 --> 48:56.223
but you still act like
a clumsy country boy.

48:56.433 --> 48:57.975
Now excuse me.

49:15.035 --> 49:16.369
And halt!

49:17.496 --> 49:19.163
About face!

49:20.248 --> 49:21.916
And march!

49:23.126 --> 49:25.419
Left! Left, right, left!

49:29.257 --> 49:32.885
Two summons in two days.
Your Majesty honors me.

49:32.928 --> 49:35.930
Cut it out.
Please, think nothing of it.

49:36.348 --> 49:38.891
You're a good fellow, D'Artagnan.

49:38.976 --> 49:42.728
So, how are the ladies
treating you these days?

49:43.605 --> 49:45.690
- Can't complain.
- Yes, indeed.

49:45.857 --> 49:48.025
Well, same here, of course. Thing is...

49:50.946 --> 49:53.656
I've got this friend.

49:54.616 --> 49:56.450
Just a regular chap, like you and me.

49:56.827 --> 49:58.536
He got married very young.

49:59.037 --> 50:02.081
Political alliance, arranged marriage,
you know the sort of thing.

50:02.249 --> 50:03.374
Hardly knew the girl.

50:03.542 --> 50:06.460
- But he likes her?
- Oh, yes.

50:06.628 --> 50:07.670
Mmm-hmm.

50:07.754 --> 50:08.754
Very much.

50:09.172 --> 50:10.881
Well, does she like him?

50:11.049 --> 50:14.719
Well, funny you should say that.
That's the problem.

50:14.928 --> 50:16.971
He's... He's not sure.

50:18.890 --> 50:21.308
Well, he just feels like a fool
when he's around her.

50:21.643 --> 50:24.937
He's always saying the wrong thing.
His palms are sweating.

50:25.564 --> 50:28.899
His heart's pumping so loud
he's afraid she might hear it.

50:29.151 --> 50:30.693
Lt's torture just to look at her.

50:31.653 --> 50:34.530
- Have you ever felt this way?
- Not until recently.

50:36.450 --> 50:40.494
So, what do we do?
I mean, my friend. What does he do?

50:42.372 --> 50:44.832
He should speak his heart.

50:45.584 --> 50:48.878
Be someone who cares for her
and isn't afraid to show it.

50:51.590 --> 50:53.007
Be himself.

50:53.425 --> 50:55.176
Well, that's what I told him.

50:55.302 --> 50:57.094
Well, then he's doubly lucky.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.972
After all, he does have
Your Majesty as a friend.

51:00.140 --> 51:03.893
Yes. Yes. lt's good to have friends.

51:07.355 --> 51:09.315
Will you excuse me just for one moment?

51:10.233 --> 51:11.650
I don't believe it.

51:18.825 --> 51:19.867
How are you?

51:20.535 --> 51:21.786
Very well.

51:24.372 --> 51:25.831
I'm wearing blue.

51:26.666 --> 51:28.000
And you look very handsome in it.

51:29.503 --> 51:34.090
Thank you. Yes, I...
You're looking just very lovely.

51:34.174 --> 51:38.094
In fact, I was only just remarking
to D'Artagnan how...

51:40.097 --> 51:41.555
How beautiful you are.

51:43.475 --> 51:44.558
Thank you, My Lord.

53:18.486 --> 53:20.738
- How did it go?
- Clockwork.

53:21.198 --> 53:22.281
Good.

53:23.033 --> 53:26.535
You'll go back to London
with Buckingham and the diamonds.

53:26.703 --> 53:28.329
And what should I do with them?

53:28.496 --> 53:32.249
Put them in his personal vault,
the most secure location in all of England.

53:32.417 --> 53:34.293
- The Tower of London.
- Yup.

53:35.420 --> 53:38.464
When the scandal breaks,
he'll deny everything.

53:38.798 --> 53:41.133
But once the diamonds
are discovered in his possession...

53:41.384 --> 53:44.011
He would have led England to war
through his indiscretion.

53:45.764 --> 53:48.891
And what of the future of France?

53:51.269 --> 53:52.645
I am France.

54:02.322 --> 54:03.989
One last thing.

54:06.993 --> 54:10.162
I suppose it's quite easy,
perhaps even tempting,

54:10.205 --> 54:13.332
for a double agent to play both sides.

54:14.542 --> 54:17.795
Have I given Your Eminence
any reason to doubt my loyalty?

54:17.837 --> 54:19.463
Spare me the rhetoric.

54:20.757 --> 54:23.550
I know who you are. I know what you are.

54:25.011 --> 54:28.597
You have a gift for corruption
and a penchant for betrayal.

54:28.682 --> 54:30.516
I admire such skills.

54:31.393 --> 54:33.936
But I'll destroy you the moment I suspect

54:34.187 --> 54:36.438
you might be using them against me.

54:38.316 --> 54:40.317
Do we understand one another?

54:42.570 --> 54:43.696
There

54:44.864 --> 54:47.074
is another side to that coin.

54:47.867 --> 54:51.912
Lt's quite easy for an employer
to sever all ties with his operative,

54:52.622 --> 54:55.874
in the event that they are compromised,
leaving them to

54:55.917 --> 54:58.961
rot in jail or on the gallows.

55:01.256 --> 55:02.965
Your point being?

55:04.634 --> 55:08.178
I require a guarantee
that I shall not suffer a similar fate.

55:10.056 --> 55:12.558
An insurance policy, if you will.

55:13.643 --> 55:15.644
My word should suffice.

55:16.813 --> 55:19.690
I'm afraid I'll need something a bit more

55:21.192 --> 55:22.568
substantial.

55:25.405 --> 55:28.991
"It is by my order
and for the good of the State

55:29.075 --> 55:33.162
"that the bearer of this
has done what has been done."

55:33.747 --> 55:35.122
Satisfied?

55:35.540 --> 55:36.623
Immensely.

55:43.048 --> 55:44.381
Your Majesty.

55:44.841 --> 55:45.841
Purple?

55:48.094 --> 55:50.304
Fashion favors the bold.

55:51.681 --> 55:52.681
Here.

55:52.974 --> 55:54.600
Try this for size.

55:56.144 --> 55:57.144
Oh, well.

55:57.354 --> 55:58.937
Do give my regards to the Queen.

55:59.397 --> 56:03.317
I will convey your diplomatic proposal
to King James immediately.

56:03.485 --> 56:06.320
Cardinal Richelieu, a pleasure.

56:07.030 --> 56:08.280
All mine.

56:14.412 --> 56:15.829
Your Eminence.

56:35.600 --> 56:36.600
Richelieu!

56:36.643 --> 56:37.768
Richelieu!

56:38.603 --> 56:40.687
There has been
the most distressing development.

56:40.814 --> 56:42.147
Certain letters,

56:42.190 --> 56:45.234
love letters, were discovered
in the Queen's possession.

56:45.318 --> 56:46.568
Letters from him.

56:46.986 --> 56:49.238
Buckingham, of course! Who else?

56:49.322 --> 56:51.407
Have you spoken to the Queen
about these letters?

56:51.616 --> 56:54.827
No. Of course I haven't.
She'll just deny the whole thing!

56:55.161 --> 56:56.203
Hmm.

56:56.287 --> 56:58.997
I can see Your Majesty's dilemma.

56:59.916 --> 57:03.252
Is there any mention
of a specific encounter? A detail?

57:04.337 --> 57:06.755
- A token of affection, perhaps?
- Yes.

57:06.923 --> 57:08.298
Yes, there is.

57:08.800 --> 57:12.553
A necklace. The one I gave her
for our anniversary. Here.

57:12.720 --> 57:16.432
"I shall always cherish
the 1 2 studded diamonds you gave me,

57:17.016 --> 57:19.268
"the proof of our consummated love."

57:20.270 --> 57:23.355
Does "consummated" mean
what I think it means?

57:23.565 --> 57:25.274
Yes, I'm afraid it does.

57:27.193 --> 57:28.569
Oh, my God!

57:29.571 --> 57:32.239
All Your Majesty has to do is throw a ball.

57:33.158 --> 57:34.867
What? How would that help?

57:35.034 --> 57:38.454
Lt would give Your Majesty the pretext
to suggest to the Queen

57:38.538 --> 57:39.746
that she wear your gift.

57:41.458 --> 57:44.877
Oh, Richelieu, that's very clever.
That's very clever.

57:45.837 --> 57:47.504
So, if she has the diamonds...

57:47.755 --> 57:49.381
Your Majesty can rest easy.

57:51.217 --> 57:52.634
And if she doesn't?

57:54.053 --> 57:57.055
He wants to have a celebration ball,
five days from now.

57:57.474 --> 57:59.892
Send my diamonds to the jeweler's
to be polished.

58:00.226 --> 58:02.936
I want the King's undivided attention
that evening.

58:23.208 --> 58:24.416
I hope I am not interrupting.

58:24.626 --> 58:27.336
Hardly, Your Majesty. To what do I owe...

58:27.420 --> 58:28.420
I know.

58:29.547 --> 58:32.299
Perhaps Your Majesty
would care to be a bit more specific?

58:32.926 --> 58:34.134
I know.

58:34.802 --> 58:35.844
Yeah.

58:35.929 --> 58:38.805
I assume this is the part
where I'm supposed to laugh maniacally

58:38.890 --> 58:42.893
and regale Your Majesty with the details
of some diabolical plot.

58:43.478 --> 58:46.104
However, I regret to inform Your Majesty

58:46.272 --> 58:48.815
that I have no idea of
what you're talking about.

58:48.900 --> 58:50.526
I thought you'd say that.

58:50.777 --> 58:54.154
Then why did you grace me
with the honor of your visit?

58:54.614 --> 58:56.281
To look into your eyes when you said it.

59:05.833 --> 59:07.251
Your Majesty.

59:10.797 --> 59:12.631
All may not be lost yet.

59:18.304 --> 59:20.013
Coming, coming!
Hold your horses!

59:20.557 --> 59:22.558
Lt's not a matter of
life or death, you know?

59:22.642 --> 59:24.476
Actually, it is.

59:24.811 --> 59:26.478
You want me to go to England,

59:26.563 --> 59:28.313
retrieve the diamonds,
which the Queen suspects

59:28.356 --> 59:30.315
might be in Buckingham's possession,

59:30.608 --> 59:32.734
which will naturally involve breaking into
some heavily fortified,

59:32.986 --> 59:35.070
highly impregnable facility?

59:35.154 --> 59:36.280
The Tower of London.

59:36.364 --> 59:39.241
Since the Cardinal's spies
are trying to implicate the Duke,

59:39.325 --> 59:40.617
it is the most logical choice.

59:41.452 --> 59:45.163
Then return to Paris
with every soldier, assassin,

59:45.498 --> 59:48.208
mercenary, bounty hunter,

59:48.585 --> 59:52.045
on both sides of the Channel
out to stop me from doing so.

59:52.422 --> 59:53.839
Did I miss anything?

59:54.340 --> 59:55.507
All in five days.

59:55.675 --> 59:57.801
A minor detail. Anything else?

59:58.011 --> 59:59.011
No.

01:00:00.346 --> 01:00:02.097
Well, I really only have
one question for you.

01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:05.142
Why in the world would I do that?

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:14.943
England it is.

01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:20.198
Diamonds, Buckingham,
Tower of London, five days,

01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:22.659
Queen's reputation
and the fate of France as we know it.

01:00:23.536 --> 01:00:24.745
Who's with me?

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:32.628
Well, I should imagine
the Queen would be quite generous.

01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:37.716
Count Porthos. Hmm? What do you think?
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:42.346
Besides, I hear the English women are a
lot like a frosted bottle of champagne.

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:45.182
Ice on the outside,
but once you warm them up...

01:00:45.933 --> 01:00:49.978
This isn't a great cause,
but it'll have to do.

01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:57.444
Buckingham's there, so is she.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:58.904
Who?

01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:00.906
Countess de Winter.

01:01:01.407 --> 01:01:02.532
Charlotte Backson.

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:05.160
Anne de Breuil. Lady Clarick.

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:07.412
Milady.

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:09.081
Milady?

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.626
I know her. I saw her with Rochefort.

01:01:13.127 --> 01:01:14.544
She's switched sides again.

01:01:14.712 --> 01:01:16.588
She's working for the Cardinal, no doubt.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.131
What are you going to do if you catch her?

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:23.428
Musketeers, open up
and surrender by order of the Cardinal!

01:01:23.721 --> 01:01:25.597
- You were followed.
- It's Rochefort.

01:01:26.307 --> 01:01:30.769
Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan,

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:34.147
surrender your weapons
and no harm will come to you.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:37.901
The moment they step out,

01:01:38.736 --> 01:01:39.986
kill them.

01:01:42.156 --> 01:01:43.615
Light the torches!

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:46.410
I'll count to five, then
we'll burn you out!

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.208
One!

01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:54.751
Two!

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:56.294
Three!

01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:58.380
Oh! Sorry! Didn't see you there.

01:01:58.464 --> 01:01:59.673
Damn you!

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:04.970
Fire!

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:21.361
Let me guess.

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:23.739
You've come to tell me
that the Musketeers are dead,

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:26.575
our plan is proceeding on schedule,

01:02:26.659 --> 01:02:29.536
and I have absolutely, positively,
nothing to worry about.

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.831
We were taken by surprise, Your Eminence.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:35.542
Somehow I was laboring
under the assumption

01:02:35.626 --> 01:02:38.587
that the plan was for you
to take them by surprise.

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:42.257
- Was it not?
- Eminence...

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:44.009
Yes, you are quite fond of that word,
aren't you?

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:47.095
Sadly, repeating it
doesn't get you into my good graces.

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:49.723
Alert Milady. Watch the ports.

01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:52.601
No one is to leave for England
without my official permission.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:54.686
Post a bounty on their heads.

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:56.605
The bigger, the better.

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:58.523
Yes, Your Eminence.

01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:00.066
Rochefort.

01:03:03.362 --> 01:03:05.322
Do not fail me again.

01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:19.503
Jussac and a lot of help.
There's no way past.

01:03:20.087 --> 01:03:21.546
How the hell did he get here so fast?

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:27.719
- Now what?
- We need a distraction.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.346
- I'll go.
- I'll go.

01:03:29.388 --> 01:03:30.680
I could go.

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:32.390
Probably not.

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:33.517
Wrong.

01:03:33.559 --> 01:03:36.394
Wrong on all counts.
You'll need every sword where you're going.

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:39.105
I can't help you there, but I can help.

01:03:39.565 --> 01:03:41.399
Right here, right now.

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:42.734
- If they catch you...
- They won't.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:45.445
- If they catch you...
- I'm the Queen's lady-in-waiting.

01:03:45.738 --> 01:03:47.614
You, on the other hand,
are a wanted fugitive,

01:03:47.865 --> 01:03:50.742
and about to steal
from the most powerful man in England.

01:03:51.577 --> 01:03:53.411
Which one of us should be worried?

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:54.955
Go.

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:57.207
Go so that you can come back.

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.428
Now give me that hat.

01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:19.104
D'Artagnan!

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:20.313
Get after him!

01:04:36.956 --> 01:04:37.956
Wait!

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:43.461
The diamonds will be
in Buckingham's personal vault,

01:04:43.629 --> 01:04:47.132
located in the lowest, most secure level
of the Tower, next to the crown jewels.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.259
The lock is state of the art.

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:52.137
Lt requires a key that Buckingham
carries on his person at all times.

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:53.805
Corridor leading up to it is booby-trapped.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.390
Oh, I'm glad that's straightforward.

01:04:55.933 --> 01:04:58.727
Tempt anyone
with some bread and cheese, if you...

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:01.229
You hadn't finished the briefing, actually.
I'm so sorry.

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.023
Please don't tell me off.

01:05:03.482 --> 01:05:05.984
Then it gets worse, a lot worse.

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:08.945
We have to cross three stone walls
and a moat.

01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:11.072
And there's just a couple of hundred
highly trained soldiers

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:12.657
with a predilection for not being robbed.

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:16.494
Although, since Buckingham undoubtedly
knows we're coming, thanks to Milady,

01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:18.079
that number is likely to be greater.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:20.999
And why can't we just tell
Buckingham Milady is plotting against him?

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:25.170
Because he wouldn't believe us.
Why should he? We're his sworn enemies.

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:28.757
Besides, Milady would have made sure.

01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:31.760
Athos is coming.

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:34.429
Tell me.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.016
What do you suppose he's after?

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:39.893
What does it matter?

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:45.607
Whatever it is, it's merely an excuse.
He wants revenge for Venice.

01:05:47.234 --> 01:05:48.735
He wants me.

01:05:49.695 --> 01:05:51.446
And he wants you.

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:56.409
We shall have to be ready for him.

01:05:57.703 --> 01:05:58.870
Won't we?

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:03.875
We can't outshoot them,
but we can outsmart them.

01:06:04.251 --> 01:06:06.795
He'll naturally favor
misdirection and deception.

01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:10.799
He knows we're expecting him,
but that just ups the ante.

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:12.884
She knows us.

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:16.388
What we look like, how we move,
how we think.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:18.890
He'll divide his forces, independent teams,

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:22.102
each with their own point of entry
to maximize their chances.

01:06:22.186 --> 01:06:24.270
There are four of us. So we use...

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:27.190
Well, there's five of
us, actually, if you...

01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:33.196
He's a skilled diver. He'll take the
aquatic route, through the Traitor's Gate.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:40.412
Aramis will undoubtedly rely
on agility and stealth.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.873
Check every tower, every rooftop.

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:50.422
Porthos, on the other hand,
will employ brute strength.

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:54.259
One of his preferred methods
is getting captured by the opposition.

01:06:59.223 --> 01:07:02.475
All the more reason
to take none of them alive.

01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:06.187
One more thing.

01:07:09.775 --> 01:07:12.527
They may try and drive a wedge between us.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.529
Claim to have secret information

01:07:14.613 --> 01:07:17.240
about some plot to get us
to turn against one another,

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:21.661
like, say, I'm a double agent
working for the Cardinal

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:25.248
or you're looking to get rid of me.

01:07:27.918 --> 01:07:32.630
I assure you,
nothing could be further from the truth.

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.259
Although,

01:07:38.971 --> 01:07:42.015
I suppose I should

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:46.603
search you for concealed weapons.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:50.899
That's how it's done.

01:07:52.818 --> 01:07:54.903
And that's exactly what she'll expect.

01:07:55.112 --> 01:07:58.406
So we do the unexpected.

01:07:59.825 --> 01:08:02.952
We go in broad daylight.
One man, hiding in plain sight.

01:08:02.995 --> 01:08:06.539
With all the extra security, there'll be
a lot of new faces, that's their weakness.

01:08:06.624 --> 01:08:09.834
And you, D'Artagnan, you're the wild card.

01:08:11.378 --> 01:08:13.463
We are the decoys.

01:08:13.839 --> 01:08:17.300
Now we'll try and create a distraction,
keep them occupied,

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:19.260
keep them away from you
as much as possible,

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.554
but, ultimately, it's down to you.

01:08:22.848 --> 01:08:24.808
You wanted to be a Musketeer?

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.600
You want to serve France?

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:28.645
This is your chance.

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:39.488
Left, right, left, right, left!

01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:40.948
I thought you saw the signal!

01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:44.118
- I saw you waving like an idiot!
- Well, that was the bloody signal!

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.953
I'm trying to see things
from your point of view,

01:08:46.037 --> 01:08:48.497
but, unfortunately,
I can't get my head that far up my ass!

01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:50.041
- Up your ass? I'll tell you what...
- Yes!

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.417
That's enough of that!

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.421
Finally, good,
at last, a peace officer!

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:58.466
Now listen, Sergeant,
I would like you to arrest this man!

01:08:58.551 --> 01:08:59.551
Arrest me?

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:00.926
You can't arrest me!

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:03.388
Don't you tell me that!
I've lost my prized bantam!

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:06.432
- Bantams? They are rotten!
- They are not rotten!

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:33.501
Sir! The first of the Musketeers
has been arrested!

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.920
The game is afoot.

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:40.091
Bring him to me and double the guards.
Double the troops.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:43.011
Double everything.

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:44.679
Sir!

01:09:45.346 --> 01:09:47.515
They'll come to us.

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:50.768
Well, then.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.645
I think Your Lordship
has everything under control.

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:57.108
You won't mind if I don't stay
to see how it all turns out?

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:01.613
- Do you think I might lose?
- On the contrary.

01:10:01.655 --> 01:10:04.449
I have no issues with you killing Athos,

01:10:04.491 --> 01:10:06.951
but, if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather not watch him die.

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:13.416
Tell me, what's your favorite color?

01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:20.965
Red.

01:10:21.967 --> 01:10:23.051
Why?

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:26.262
I wanted to see
if you were capable of telling the truth.

01:10:27.973 --> 01:10:28.973
Hmm.

01:10:39.151 --> 01:10:40.693
As far from here as possible.

01:10:54.708 --> 01:10:56.334
Well, well, well.

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:01.798
Look at what the cat dragged in.

01:11:03.467 --> 01:11:05.551
So, how's the old Athos, eh?

01:11:07.471 --> 01:11:10.515
Still his surly,
insufferable self, I'm sure.

01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:14.143
Sending a boy to do a man's job.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.938
I should feel insulted.

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:22.110
Well, what were you after anyway, eh?

01:11:24.196 --> 01:11:27.573
Secrets, spies, it's all a game, really.

01:11:27.866 --> 01:11:31.411
Although the price of loss,
as you'll come to discover,

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:33.663
is a little bit higher.

01:11:35.749 --> 01:11:36.833
What?

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:39.502
No last words?

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:41.838
No insults?

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.674
- Pleas for mercy or...
- What time is it?

01:11:47.219 --> 01:11:51.848
About 2:00, I'd say.
Why? Are you in a hurry?

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:56.686
Look out of the window.

01:12:04.236 --> 01:12:06.863
They weren't the decoys. I was.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.270
Ahhh!

01:13:12.012 --> 01:13:13.471
Permission to come aboard?

01:13:13.514 --> 01:13:14.639
Granted.

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:34.158
Athos!

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:56.013
The wonderful thing about fighting
an imaginary opponent, Captain Rochefort,

01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:59.684
is that he's always greatly skilled
yet easily defeated.

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.102
Eminence.

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:05.481
The pride of victory
without the risk of loss.

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:09.152
I trust you didn't come here to impress me
with your swordsmanship.

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:12.321
No, Your Eminence. I have some good news.

01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:14.449
Such as?

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:33.176
So what about the diamonds?
Doesn't Buckingham still have them?

01:14:33.218 --> 01:14:34.302
Nope.

01:14:35.179 --> 01:14:36.679
Milady likes hedging her bets.

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:37.722
She'd never have taken the chance

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:39.390
we'd actually succeed
in breaking into the vault.

01:14:41.101 --> 01:14:42.852
So where are they now?

01:14:43.228 --> 01:14:45.688
With the only person she trusts.

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:53.488
Which means we've lost her
and all this has been for nothing.

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:55.114
I wouldn't say that.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.789
You were the decoy, we were the extraction,

01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:07.335
but the real linchpin of the plan, well,

01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:10.171
that was someone else entirely.

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:15.968
Someone even Milady would never suspect.

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:23.267
Driver! What the hell is going on?

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.479
Just following your instructions, ma'am.
"As far away from here as possible."

01:15:56.134 --> 01:15:57.885
Whoo-hoo!

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:13.818
Planchet. Never thought
I'd hear myself say this, but

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:15.528
well done.

01:16:16.154 --> 01:16:17.154
Thank you, sir.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.824
That means a lot,
especially coming from you.

01:16:19.866 --> 01:16:20.950
Shut up, Planchet.

01:16:21.034 --> 01:16:22.159
Yes, sir.

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:30.668
Don't.

01:16:33.964 --> 01:16:36.299
We took the precaution
of removing the gunpowder.

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:44.515
What now?

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:48.144
You give me the diamonds
or I take them off your corpse.

01:16:48.186 --> 01:16:49.520
Dealer's choice.

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:55.443
- Anything else you'd like me to take off?
- Outside.

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:09.665
Boys.

01:17:10.542 --> 01:17:11.917
Been a while.

01:17:15.255 --> 01:17:17.048
This must be the young Gascon.

01:17:18.216 --> 01:17:19.550
We've met before.

01:17:21.178 --> 01:17:22.178
Ah, yes.

01:17:22.846 --> 01:17:24.805
Small world.

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:28.851
I didn't let Rochefort kill you.

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:32.438
You do remember that, don't you?

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:42.406
- Did you kill Buckingham?
- No.

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:45.451
- But you will kill me?
- Yes.

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.247
You would spare him, but kill me?

01:17:50.582 --> 01:17:53.167
Yes. I don't hate Buckingham.

01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:03.552
Here.

01:18:04.262 --> 01:18:05.971
You may find use for this.

01:18:09.226 --> 01:18:10.476
Move.

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:45.469
Athos.

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:08.159
At least she died the way she lived,
on her own terms.

01:19:11.621 --> 01:19:13.205
She did it for me.

01:19:15.208 --> 01:19:19.462
I wouldn't have been able to live
with myself had I pulled the trigger.

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.674
Come on, let's go home.

01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:38.773
But I can't get it.

01:19:39.357 --> 01:19:40.858
How marvelous!

01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:45.196
Oh! So great!

01:19:52.829 --> 01:19:54.705
Oh!

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.875
Your Majesty.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.543
My dear.

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:01.712
You look troubled.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.840
Hardly. Your Majesty just startled me.

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:07.092
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:20:07.552 --> 01:20:10.054
I just wanted to drop by

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:11.972
and tell you how much
I was looking forward to tonight.

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:17.561
Should be quite spectacular, you know.
Costumes, fireworks and such.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:19.772
But you,

01:20:21.441 --> 01:20:23.859
you shall be
the most spectacular sight of all.

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:27.446
And especially since
you'll wear the diamonds.

01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:29.949
You will wear them, won't you?

01:20:31.576 --> 01:20:33.994
Well, it's very important
to me that you do.

01:20:36.122 --> 01:20:38.374
Then I shall wear them, Your Majesty.

01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:41.126
Until tonight, then.

01:20:51.137 --> 01:20:52.763
She promised she'll wear them.

01:20:54.432 --> 01:20:56.267
You do think she'll wear them,
don't you, Richelieu?

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:59.395
I'm sure she will, Your Majesty.

01:20:59.604 --> 01:21:01.105
I'm sure she will.

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:31.135
I hate air travel!

01:21:46.359 --> 01:21:47.443
Damn!

01:22:17.682 --> 01:22:19.683
Hard to starboard!

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:35.407
Well, now that we have their attention,

01:22:35.492 --> 01:22:37.701
let's see if we can settle this
in a peaceful manner.

01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:39.745
More or less.

01:22:41.748 --> 01:22:43.624
Ah, Gascon!

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:47.211
So you've traded up
when it comes to transport.

01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:49.171
But, once again, you're outmatched.

01:22:49.547 --> 01:22:51.382
You can thank Milady for that.

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:54.343
She passed on Buckingham's plans
a long time ago.

01:22:54.427 --> 01:22:57.012
As you can see,
we made some improvements.

01:22:59.015 --> 01:23:00.224
Isn't she a beauty?

01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:01.684
What do you want?

01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:05.020
The diamonds.

01:23:05.563 --> 01:23:07.398
- Come and take them.
- Gladly!

01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:11.360
You see, I can blast you out of the sky
with total impunity.

01:23:11.444 --> 01:23:12.778
If you fire on me, on the other hand,

01:23:12.862 --> 01:23:14.989
you'll be killing
Miss Oh-so-young-and-pretty.

01:23:18.368 --> 01:23:20.411
You have 60 seconds.

01:23:22.372 --> 01:23:24.206
He'll shoot us down
the moment he has the diamonds.

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:25.290
We can't outrun them.

01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:26.917
And we can't fight them, damn it! We can't.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.253
- Oh, D'Artagnan.
- What?

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:32.381
Do you think
you have the monopoly on loss?

01:23:32.549 --> 01:23:33.716
What if she dies?

01:23:33.758 --> 01:23:35.300
The life of one woman
or the future of France,

01:23:35.427 --> 01:23:37.302
what would you do
if you were in my position?

01:23:39.764 --> 01:23:42.266
I've made a lot of sacrifices,
a lot of hard choices.

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:45.436
For honor, for King, for country.
You wanna know what I've learned, boy?

01:23:45.478 --> 01:23:48.605
Hard choices and sacrifices
do not keep you warm at night.

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:53.068
Life is too damn short and too damn long
to go through without someone at your side.

01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:54.778
Don't end up like me.

01:23:55.655 --> 01:23:58.949
Choose the woman.
Fight for love, D'Artagnan.

01:23:59.784 --> 01:24:01.785
France will take care of itself.

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:04.955
Time's up!

01:24:08.585 --> 01:24:09.626
An exchange.

01:24:10.795 --> 01:24:14.048
I go aboard your ship with the diamonds,
the girl comes aboard ours.

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:16.258
Once I know she's safe,

01:24:16.968 --> 01:24:18.802
I give them to you.

01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:22.806
Fine. But I want to see the diamonds first.

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:24.725
Planchet.

01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:28.812
Cut her loose.

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:33.650
- Deploy the gangway!
- Deploy the gangway!

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:44.661
Satisfied?

01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:32.543
You never learn, do you?

01:25:39.843 --> 01:25:40.884
Fire!

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:47.057
Hard right!

01:25:47.559 --> 01:25:49.159
Fire!

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:19.923
Good.

01:26:20.508 --> 01:26:22.593
I really want you to see this.

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.052
Finish them off!

01:26:26.264 --> 01:26:28.265
We can't outrun them
and we can't outgun them.

01:26:28.391 --> 01:26:31.226
We could try asking them to surrender,
but somehow I don't think it would work.

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:33.103
We hide. In there.

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:41.612
Fire!

01:26:41.779 --> 01:26:42.946
Fire!

01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:02.799
Lay in a pursuit course!

01:27:02.967 --> 01:27:05.260
Lay in a pursuit course!

01:27:05.303 --> 01:27:06.428
Fire!

01:27:11.976 --> 01:27:13.769
He's persistent, I'll give him that!

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:16.313
Fire!

01:27:20.652 --> 01:27:23.695
But, sir! We can't go into the storm!

01:27:28.034 --> 01:27:29.076
Anyone?

01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:32.120
Anyone else who wants to question orders?

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:35.749
Good.

01:27:51.557 --> 01:27:55.477
Sir, now might be a good time
to talk about the possibility of a raise?

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.687
Shut up, Planchet.

01:27:56.813 --> 01:27:58.021
Yes, sir.

01:28:15.832 --> 01:28:16.873
Where are they?

01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:21.420
You're never gonna find them in there.

01:28:22.213 --> 01:28:24.006
I beg to differ.

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:41.815
Keep after them!

01:28:41.983 --> 01:28:44.067
I'll take the Gascon!

01:28:45.903 --> 01:28:47.154
Hard to starboard!

01:29:14.849 --> 01:29:16.683
You know what your problem is, boy?

01:29:16.768 --> 01:29:21.021
You read too many books,
and then you believed them.

01:29:22.273 --> 01:29:24.149
Courage, honor.

01:29:25.318 --> 01:29:26.443
All for one.

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:30.530
But history isn't written by heroes,
it's written by victors.

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:32.657
Keep your eyes open!

01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:44.002
Round two.

01:29:44.170 --> 01:29:45.295
Oh...

01:29:55.848 --> 01:29:57.349
Return fire!

01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:08.360
Pull up, damn it!

01:30:08.528 --> 01:30:09.694
We're too heavy!

01:30:11.489 --> 01:30:13.698
You scared to take me in a fair fight?

01:30:15.034 --> 01:30:16.284
Hardly.

01:30:17.203 --> 01:30:18.912
I just don't fight fair.

01:30:20.873 --> 01:30:25.752
Captain Rochefort!

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:27.712
Oh, well.

01:30:45.231 --> 01:30:46.690
Drop the ballast!

01:30:46.941 --> 01:30:48.316
Drop everything!

01:30:48.734 --> 01:30:50.444
And fire up the burners!

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:52.237
Over the side!

01:30:53.156 --> 01:30:54.573
Drop those barrels!

01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:56.658
Faster! Move!

01:31:08.504 --> 01:31:09.629
Shall we?

01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:20.974
Hold on!

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:26.438
Get out of the way!

01:31:27.732 --> 01:31:29.232
Go! Run!

01:32:41.764 --> 01:32:45.433
I still have the diamonds.
What do you propose to do about that?

01:32:45.977 --> 01:32:47.060
Kill you.

01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:56.987
If you insist.

01:33:06.872 --> 01:33:07.998
Oh!

01:35:29.098 --> 01:35:30.807
You should've stayed in Gascony, boy.

01:35:39.483 --> 01:35:42.026
You should've apologized to my horse.

01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:19.689
Surround the palace!
Shoot the Musketeers on sight!

01:36:19.732 --> 01:36:23.359
Use every man at your disposal!
Any means necessary!

01:36:23.527 --> 01:36:25.278
- Your Eminence!
- Don't interrupt!

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:27.280
These men must not...

01:36:53.265 --> 01:36:54.599
Arrest these men!

01:37:02.233 --> 01:37:03.274
What is the meaning of this?

01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:07.070
Your Majesty, these men...

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:10.406
Are delivering a gift for Your Majesty.
Compliments of the Cardinal.

01:37:12.117 --> 01:37:14.577
Cardinal, you shouldn't have.

01:37:16.914 --> 01:37:20.542
Well, Your Majesty did ask me
to get you one of those, so...

01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:22.293
So I did.

01:37:25.506 --> 01:37:27.340
But what happened to it?

01:37:27.675 --> 01:37:30.176
Buckingham's spy, Rochefort,
attempted to sabotage the craft.

01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:32.095
- He's been dealt with.
- Rochefort?

01:37:32.805 --> 01:37:34.639
He's Captain of your guards, isn't he?

01:37:34.807 --> 01:37:35.849
Actually,

01:37:36.225 --> 01:37:39.644
His Eminence was the one
who uncovered the traitor.

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:46.526
"lt is by my order
and for the good of the State

01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:50.738
"that the bearer of this
has done what has been done."

01:37:52.324 --> 01:37:55.910
- That's your signature, isn't it, Richelieu?
- It would appear so, Your Majesty.

01:37:56.078 --> 01:37:57.996
Well, let me get this right.

01:37:58.163 --> 01:38:02.750
You brought me an airship
and exposed a snake in our midst?

01:38:03.335 --> 01:38:05.420
How can I ever repay you?

01:38:05.588 --> 01:38:07.505
I could think of a few ways.

01:38:08.757 --> 01:38:09.757
Anne.

01:38:11.135 --> 01:38:13.469
I was just returning from the jewelers.

01:38:16.473 --> 01:38:18.433
Well, I realize it's a little early,

01:38:19.101 --> 01:38:21.644
but the orchestra's here and so are we.

01:38:22.646 --> 01:38:24.814
Would Your Majesty care to dance?

01:38:25.399 --> 01:38:26.941
I would love to.

01:38:30.112 --> 01:38:31.988
Well, mind out, you fellows!

01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:33.448
D'Artagnan.

01:38:34.491 --> 01:38:35.491
Well, well, well.

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:40.163
Looks like you aren't the only one
who gets the girl.

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:42.457
Your Majesty is a natural.

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:45.043
Guess I am.

01:38:46.128 --> 01:38:47.837
As a matter of fact,

01:38:48.005 --> 01:38:51.424
I think you'll start noticing
a few more changes around here.

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:53.760
Thank you.

01:38:55.679 --> 01:38:56.888
For everything.

01:38:57.139 --> 01:38:58.431
Any time.

01:39:00.351 --> 01:39:01.601
Well, strike up, then!

01:39:01.769 --> 01:39:02.977
Your Majesty!

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:05.229
Positions, please, gentlemen!

01:39:10.653 --> 01:39:11.778
Well-played.

01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:23.289
I could use men like you.

01:39:28.754 --> 01:39:29.837
I already have a job.

01:39:29.922 --> 01:39:32.215
- I'm a drunk.
- I'm independently wealthy.

01:39:32.383 --> 01:39:34.050
Thanks, but no.

01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:38.596
The day will come
when you'll wish you had said, "Yes".

01:39:38.764 --> 01:39:39.889
Maybe.

01:39:40.057 --> 01:39:41.265
But not today.

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.393
Maybe not today.

01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:55.446
Enjoying the show?

01:39:55.739 --> 01:39:57.573
Are you always this cocky?

01:39:57.741 --> 01:39:59.075
Only on Tuesdays

01:39:59.118 --> 01:40:01.452
and whenever beautiful women are involved.

01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.579
So you think I'm beautiful.

01:40:04.957 --> 01:40:06.666
Actually, it's Tuesday.

01:40:33.444 --> 01:40:36.487
- So, what now?
- We drink.

01:40:36.947 --> 01:40:37.947
And then what?

01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:41.242
Wherever they send us.
Whatever France needs.

01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:44.328
I thought you didn't believe
in that stuff anymore.

01:40:45.497 --> 01:40:46.998
I believe in us.

01:40:47.791 --> 01:40:49.167
Till the day I stop believing that,

01:40:49.293 --> 01:40:52.628
there are still things in this world
worth fighting and dying for.

01:40:58.594 --> 01:40:59.677
All for one!

01:40:59.762 --> 01:41:01.304
And one for all!

01:41:03.098 --> 01:41:04.807
You know, sirs,

01:41:04.975 --> 01:41:10.146
I know you can be mean, tough,
foul-tempered bastards,

01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:14.192
but sometimes I get the feeling
that deep down you're all...

01:41:14.318 --> 01:41:16.694
Shut up, Planchet!

01:41:17.154 --> 01:41:18.863
Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:41:32.169 --> 01:41:35.838
In case you're wondering,
this isn't the afterlife.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:38.341
I'm not dead,

01:41:38.675 --> 01:41:40.593
and neither are you.

01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:46.265
What?

01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:49.852
How did you...

01:41:50.145 --> 01:41:52.146
Followed Athos.

01:41:52.689 --> 01:41:54.524
We fished you out of the Channel.

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:02.698
- Where are we going?
- To France, of course.

01:42:04.535 --> 01:42:06.035
Sail away!

01:42:06.203 --> 01:42:10.998
To get back what's mine
and pay back, with interest.

01:42:11.166 --> 01:42:13.000
