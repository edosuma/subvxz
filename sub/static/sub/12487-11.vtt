WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.869
All right, Bulldogs,

00:03.969 --> 00:05.437
     if we beat the Mustangs
           this week,

00:05.538 --> 00:07.239
     we'll be sittin' pretty
        for the playoffs.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.074
     - Ah, that's no problem
         for me, Coach.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.809
      I already sit pretty.

00:10.910 --> 00:14.013
       I also stand pretty
     and kneel pretty, see?

00:14.114 --> 00:17.349
          - You're also
       "pretty" annoying.

00:17.450 --> 00:20.753
Okay, QB, run the offense.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.755
Everybody, lineup!

00:22.856 --> 00:25.491
       Okay, trick right,
       wide hook, x-post.

00:25.592 --> 00:26.892
         On one, on one.

00:26.993 --> 00:30.496
           Set! Hike!

00:36.836 --> 00:38.537
  - Dawson, are--are you okay?

00:38.638 --> 00:40.339
        - I--I think so.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.542
- Oh, maybe not.
- Oh! Oh!

00:43.643 --> 00:45.077
        - I'm hurt, too.

00:45.178 --> 00:47.079
   - Are you all right, Bella?
         What happened?

00:47.180 --> 00:49.114
       - It's my shoulder.
        - It's my pinky!

00:49.215 --> 00:50.783
  - Oh, no, we need you, Bella.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.053
We need you,
           too, Newt.

00:54.154 --> 00:55.921
 - Oh, this can't be happening.

00:56.022 --> 00:57.256
     - All right, keep going
         with practise.

00:57.357 --> 00:59.091
      I'm gonna take Bella
         to the doctor.

00:59.192 --> 01:02.261
I'm sorry, Newt.

01:02.362 --> 01:04.229
 I thought you were just faking
       for the attention.

01:04.330 --> 01:06.365
        - No, I seriously
       stubbed this thing.

01:06.466 --> 01:09.368
      - All right, come to
        the doctor, too.

01:09.469 --> 01:12.337
  - Wait up! I can't walk that
     fast with a bad pinky.

01:12.439 --> 01:15.808
      Ow! Ow! Ow! Wait up!
           Come back!

        I have to sit out

01:52.278 --> 01:54.046
    today's practise to rehab
        my bruised pinky.

01:54.147 --> 01:57.950
      - Take the week off.
        - See ya, Monday.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.052
        - Oh, no, Bella,
    did you break something?

02:00.153 --> 02:01.787
 - You're not gonna have to quit
       football, are you?

02:01.888 --> 02:03.455
    - If you do, can we have
          your towels?

02:03.556 --> 02:04.857
       - They're so soft.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.825
        - How do you know
        about my towels?

02:06.926 --> 02:08.794
         - We should go.

02:08.895 --> 02:12.698
 - Relax, guys, the doctor said
 it's just a sprained shoulder.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.733
  - I'm sorry. I once had a pig
  who had a sprained shoulder.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.935
 We had to ice him and nurse him
 back to health for two months.

02:17.036 --> 02:18.103
      - Did he get better?

02:18.204 --> 02:19.972
       - Yep, just in time
      for Christmas dinner.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.407
- What?
- What?

02:22.509 --> 02:24.009
         He had his own
       seat at the table.

02:24.110 --> 02:25.878
      He was an indoor pig.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.713
      - BELLA, TROY, COACH:
             Ahhh...

02:27.814 --> 02:29.248
   - I appreciate the concern,

02:29.349 --> 02:31.416
but I should be back and playing
     again in a week or so.

02:31.518 --> 02:34.253
- Well, it looks like you're our
 QB until Bella gets back, Troy.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.155
    - The Wonder Boy is back.

02:36.256 --> 02:38.257
         - Yeah, I guess
     the Wonder Boy is back.

02:38.358 --> 02:39.825
     ♪ Uh-huh, I'm awesome ♪

02:39.926 --> 02:41.393
          ♪ Uh-huh-- ♪
           - Uh, yeah.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.428
 Dawson, when you have a second,
       can I have a word?

02:43.530 --> 02:44.696
         - Sure, Coach.

02:44.797 --> 02:46.899
    - Hey, Bella, do you have
     the red practise jersey

02:47.000 --> 02:48.800
for your new QB?

02:48.902 --> 02:51.670
     - Yeah, uh, right here.
            - Thanks.

02:51.771 --> 02:53.605
           Uh, Bella?
            - Sorry.

02:53.706 --> 02:56.808
    Oh, and I had to widen it
    a bit in the bicep area.

02:56.910 --> 03:00.512
  You're workin' with some real
   pipe cleaners there, kiddo.

03:00.613 --> 03:03.715
      - Hey, I am built for
        speed, not power.

03:05.285 --> 03:08.320
             Right?
          - Yeah, sure.

03:08.421 --> 03:11.190
 - Look, Dawson, the best thing
   for a bad shoulder is rest.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.925
        If you don't let
        it heal properly,

03:13.026 --> 03:14.860
    you could end up like me.

03:14.961 --> 03:18.330
  I wake up in the morning and
 I sound like microwave popcorn.

03:22.068 --> 03:24.369
      - But, Coach, I don't
          want to rest.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.905
    If I miss a lot of games,
      you might replace me.

03:27.006 --> 03:29.341
  - You're our best QB, Dawson.

03:29.442 --> 03:32.477
  My point is your job is safe.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.479
Thanks, Coach.

03:34.581 --> 03:35.781
        I'm so relieved.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.115
   Hey, while I'm healing up,

03:37.217 --> 03:38.984
       I could teach Troy
        the new offense.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.719
       - Uh, yeah, I don't
          know, Dawson.

03:40.820 --> 03:43.989
 I don't wanna take any chances
 with the sprain getting worse.

03:44.090 --> 03:45.824
     - Hey, guys, good news.

03:45.925 --> 03:48.527
I just came up with a play where
    I throw a pass to myself!

03:48.628 --> 03:51.430
            I call it
 "The Troy to Troy Connection."

03:53.866 --> 03:55.601
         So, we'll talk?

03:58.104 --> 04:00.739
      - Teach him, Dawson.
         Teach him now.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.978
     - Attention, everyone.
   We're starting a new unit.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.113
     So we will be switching
          lab partners.

04:08.214 --> 04:10.382
        - Aw, he's gonna
          break us up.

04:10.483 --> 04:11.984
       - Pete, you're with
            Jonathan.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.852
    Pepper, you're with Alan.

04:13.953 --> 04:16.255
   Sophie, you're with, uh...
  - Please be me. Please be me.

04:16.356 --> 04:17.956
       - ...Newt. Sophie,
        you're with Newt.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.690
             - Yes!

04:19.791 --> 04:21.459
        - But, Mr. Matu--
   - I don't want to hear it.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.262
 It took me 45 minutes to figure
     out this seating chart.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.464
    It's not going to change.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.301
    - Ready to have some fun?
    You don't know this yet,

04:29.402 --> 04:32.337
  but I'm the best lab partner
      in all of Silverado.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.707
          Right, Alan?
  - It's true. He's a lab god.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.911
         - Good to know.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.146
  - Oh, and I smell good, too.

04:41.247 --> 04:42.514
       Wanna take a whiff
         of my cologne?

04:42.615 --> 04:44.983
I already have.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.052
      - The whole room has.

04:47.153 --> 04:49.321
    - Okay, Troy, we've added
       a lot of new plays

04:49.422 --> 04:51.056
         since the last
        time you were QB.

04:51.157 --> 04:52.624
          So, I'm gonna
      get you up to speed.

04:52.725 --> 04:54.326
     - Yeah, well, don't do
       too good of a job,

04:54.427 --> 04:56.028
     or else I might end up
        taking your spot.

04:57.497 --> 04:59.398
   - Yeah, right, like that's
       ever gonna happen.

04:59.499 --> 05:01.400
    Okay, let's look at some
    film from our last game.

05:01.501 --> 05:03.735
        The defense is in
        a cover two zone.

05:03.836 --> 05:05.804
     You have three possible
         receivers here.

05:05.905 --> 05:07.739
  See how I find Sawyer open--

05:07.840 --> 05:09.741
      - Great oogly-moogly,
       Troy the Wonder Boy

05:09.842 --> 05:11.143
   is blazin' down the field.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.911
     He's so fast, he's got
         time to spare.

05:13.012 --> 05:14.112
   Oh, he's even headin' over

05:14.213 --> 05:15.580
     to the opposing team's
          cheerleaders.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.749
    Get those figures, Troy.
             - Troy!

05:17.850 --> 05:20.552
    Stop playing with dollies
       and pay attention.

05:20.653 --> 05:24.456
 Now, open up your playbook and
  let's go over the game plan.

05:24.557 --> 05:26.625
     - Bella, look, I don't
        need a game plan.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.795
      We both know The Troy
        already has game.

05:29.896 --> 05:32.331
 Ooh, I wonder if Coach has any
     magnetic cheerleaders.

05:32.432 --> 05:34.266
- Give me that!

05:34.367 --> 05:38.470
- Ow! Oh, no, it's getting
        worse.

05:38.571 --> 05:42.007
- Sorry, that was me.

05:42.108 --> 05:48.046
               - ♪

05:48.147 --> 05:50.148
       - Something pretty
       for someone pretty.

05:50.249 --> 05:55.053
          - Uh, thanks.
     Uh, I'll cherish this.

05:56.889 --> 05:59.825
    Okay, today I just wanna
       focus on chemistry.

05:59.926 --> 06:04.629
     - So do I--specifically
        "our" chemistry.

06:04.731 --> 06:06.198
        - Come on, Newt.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.666
       - Even he knew that
         was a bit much,

06:07.767 --> 06:09.801
      and he knows nothing
          about women.

06:09.902 --> 06:12.104
             Sorry.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.740
        - No, It's true.
       I'm an only child.

06:14.841 --> 06:17.142
      And I have two dads.

06:17.243 --> 06:18.543
          - All right,
     time to start the lab.

06:18.644 --> 06:21.813
       Let's flip on those
         Bunsen burners.

06:21.914 --> 06:23.949
      - How about a little
         romantic music

06:24.050 --> 06:25.650
   to go with the candlelight?

06:28.554 --> 06:31.923
             - Okay.
      - What are you doing?

06:32.024 --> 06:33.358
     - Mr. Matu, I'm sorry.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.427
  I know you worked really hard
      on the seating chart,

06:35.528 --> 06:37.796
        but can I please
     have a new lab partner?

06:37.897 --> 06:39.364
     - Why? What's going on?

06:39.465 --> 06:41.400
   - Newt is driving me crazy.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.571
     - Yeah, I can see that.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.874
         How about Alan?
      - Great. I love Alan.

06:48.975 --> 06:50.709
           Who's Alan?
           - I'm Alan.

06:50.810 --> 06:54.112
     - Oh, sweet, that dude.
         Let's do this.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.951
  - Okay, who are you throwing
        to when you call

07:00.052 --> 07:02.053
    a jet 2, wide 6, x-post?

07:02.155 --> 07:03.622
Nice try, Bella.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.490
       I know a fake play
        when I hear one.

07:05.591 --> 07:09.261
       - It's right there
   on the armband I made you.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.096
      It's the first play!

07:11.197 --> 07:13.498
          - Oh. My bad.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.400
        It's okay, okay?
 I don't need that play anyway.

07:15.501 --> 07:18.403
    - Come on, Troy, we face
    the Mustangs in two days.

07:18.504 --> 07:21.339
 - Bella, quit riding me, okay?
     I know what I'm doing.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.508
          I have played
       quarterback before.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.844
     - Okay, then how about
       a little challenge?

07:25.945 --> 07:27.245
      You play quarterback
        with the offense

          - Good news?
    That's spectacular news.

       So, what's fun Newt
     have planned for today?

16:50.909 --> 16:52.777
     - Well, after we finish

16:52.878 --> 16:54.946
       I'm gonna make some
         Italian sodas.

16:55.047 --> 16:56.581

    beautiful cherry blossom.

         romantic Newt?

17:15.166 --> 17:17.300
Newt, please.

17:17.403 --> 17:19.904
     - I'm sorry. It's just
    you're asking for a lot.

17:20.005 --> 17:21.873
       - Okay, how's this?

17:21.973 --> 17:23.840

        I like fun Newt.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.983
       I want to hang out
      with him more often.

17:32.084 --> 17:34.018
       - You know, I think
         I can do that.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.120
        - Great. I'm glad
        we had this talk.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.456
         So, let's start
       making some sodas.

   - Wait a minute, I thought
       you were with Newt.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.495
  - I'm sorry. We switched back
      without telling you.

    Whatever she has to say,
      don't listen to her.

    - I'm here to apologize.
           - Proceed.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.351
       - I'm sorry for how
        I've been acting.

18:07.453 --> 18:09.020
    Because, the truth is...

18:09.121 --> 18:10.955
      whether I'm starting
       quarterback or not,

18:11.056 --> 18:13.091
       I still wanna help
          the Bulldogs.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.226
      - Well, I appreciate
          that, Dawson.

18:15.327 --> 18:16.894
       - If Troy is going
       to be the starter,

18:16.995 --> 18:19.097
      then I'll be the best
        backup I can be.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.199
   I'll help get him ready for
    games, review game film,

18:21.300 --> 18:23.201
        and I'll even let
       him use my towels.

         No, seriously,
     ask them how they know.

18:30.242 --> 18:33.778
      - Yeah, look, Dawson,
  Troy and I have been talking

18:33.879 --> 18:36.147
         and you need to
      understand something.

18:36.248 --> 18:37.949
   When you're all healed up,

18:38.050 --> 18:41.352
      you're going back to
 being my starting quarterback.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.553
       - Are you serious?

18:42.654 --> 18:45.089
         - Bella, look,
       I hate to say this,

18:45.190 --> 18:47.024
        I mean, I really
        hate to say this,

     I mean, in the future,
 I might deny saying this, but--

18:50.229 --> 18:53.564
             - Troy!

18:53.665 --> 18:56.367
      - Look, Bella, you're
     the better quarterback.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.802
      In one week, you were
         able to show me

18:57.903 --> 18:59.804
         a whole new way
      to play the position.

18:59.905 --> 19:01.239

     the last game for us--
