00:00.114 --> 00:01.603
<i>Previously on "Switched at birth"...</i>

00:01.674 --> 00:03.828
I'm wondering where you got
my lucky guitar pick.

00:03.871 --> 00:04.682
Your guitar pick?

00:12.186 --> 00:14.020
Let's talk about Sarah Lazar.

00:14.054 --> 00:16.289
She was a reporter for
the "Kansas City Herald"'s sport section.

00:16.323 --> 00:18.827
Yeah, I know who she is,
but why are you bringing her up?

00:18.967 --> 00:20.119
You are incredible.

00:20.119 --> 00:22.241
I'm out of comebacks.
Can we make out now?

00:22.508 --> 00:25.377
There is a space for rent around
the corner from my apartment.

00:25.411 --> 00:26.872
It would be perfect for a salon.

00:26.872 --> 00:28.840
I saved up enough money to cover the lease

00:28.874 --> 00:30.608
and whatever you need for the equipment.

00:30.643 --> 00:33.087
If you wanna sue this hospital,
I say I'm your guy.

00:33.087 --> 00:35.297
Okay, Craig Tebbe, let's make some noise.

00:35.297 --> 00:37.498
- All right.
- I don't wanna disappear.

00:37.533 --> 00:39.334
I've already missed out on so much.

00:51.714 --> 00:55.350
Uh, if I had known

00:55.384 --> 00:58.419
that we'd have to carry
this stuff eight blocks,

00:58.454 --> 01:00.388
I would've sprung for a sherpa.

01:00.969 --> 01:01.983
Oh.

01:02.624 --> 01:05.911
Now I'm sweaty and I look more
nervous than I already am.

01:08.922 --> 01:12.400
Yeah, 'cause that worked
out so well with your mom.

01:31.601 --> 01:33.321
I can't tell you how...

01:33.355 --> 01:35.356
Okay, friendly. Hi.

01:52.962 --> 01:55.476
Yeah, we would've parked closer,

01:55.511 --> 01:58.746
but some idiot decided
that his small-penis car

01:58.781 --> 02:00.548
was too good for one space.

02:02.317 --> 02:03.233
Yeah, that's the one.

02:06.065 --> 02:06.971
Hello!

02:09.741 --> 02:11.492
That was her car?

02:18.400 --> 02:21.992
- Hello.
- No big deal.

02:21.992 --> 02:24.439
No, you're right. I am a terrible parker.

02:24.473 --> 02:26.507
Uh, it's really nice to meet you.

02:26.542 --> 02:28.409
You're signing is really awesome.

02:28.444 --> 02:30.511
I can't believe you've just been
practicing for a few months.

02:30.653 --> 02:33.414
- Really? Thank you.
- Yeah. Good.

02:34.583 --> 02:38.619
I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.

02:38.654 --> 02:40.455
Are you deaf?

02:40.489 --> 02:42.623
I'm hard of hearing,
but if you're looking at me,

02:42.658 --> 02:44.725
I'm pretty much gonna get everything,
so you're fine.

02:44.760 --> 02:48.396
How long have you been hard of hearing?

02:48.430 --> 02:50.298
Hard of hearing. Right, very good.

02:50.332 --> 02:52.433
I started losing it in high school,

02:52.468 --> 02:55.369
amongst other things.

02:57.339 --> 02:58.639
Sorry.

02:58.674 --> 03:01.852
You know I say inappropriate
things when I'm nervous.

03:02.792 --> 03:04.088
Where should I put this stuff?

03:04.160 --> 03:06.314
I think near the bookcase would be fine.

03:06.348 --> 03:08.649
- So just over here?
- Yeah.

03:11.587 --> 03:15.289
Right next to the giant bong. Uh...

03:28.531 --> 03:30.271
We were always so good at that.

03:30.305 --> 03:33.474
Oh yeah, but not much else.

03:33.509 --> 03:35.643
Well, hopefully that will change.

03:38.656 --> 03:41.415
Do you remember that hotel in Cocoa Beach?

03:43.452 --> 03:46.487
That was awful! It rained the whole time.

03:46.522 --> 03:48.656
Well, staying indoors has its benefits.

03:48.690 --> 03:53.112
Those maids kept asking us
if we needed turn-down service.

03:53.386 --> 03:56.597
- Strange we never did...
- Nope.

04:00.085 --> 04:01.022
- Oh my god.
- What?

04:01.065 --> 04:03.471
It's almost 4:00.
I gotta get back before Daphne gets home.

04:03.505 --> 04:06.407
- Relax, Regina.
- No, I just...

04:06.712 --> 04:09.510
I don't want to lie to her
about where I was.

04:11.872 --> 04:13.648
I... I'm sorry, I just... you know,

04:13.682 --> 04:15.516
I don't know what I would tell Daphne

04:15.551 --> 04:17.317
or Bay, for that matter.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.253
And when are we going to tell them?

04:20.355 --> 04:22.523
Um, I don't know.

04:22.558 --> 04:24.559
Whoa whoa whoa, wait.
When do I see you again?

04:24.593 --> 04:26.460
Uh, I don't know.

04:26.495 --> 04:28.563
Okay, bye.

04:29.320 --> 04:29.630
Bye.

04:32.747 --> 04:34.949
Buckle up. We have a date set for trial.

04:36.370 --> 04:38.786
I guess this is really happening.

04:39.138 --> 04:41.491
My sources tell me this is
the private investigator

04:41.491 --> 04:43.991
the hospital wants to hire
to dig up dirt on you.

04:44.286 --> 04:46.894
Many bothans died to bring
us this information.

04:48.797 --> 04:51.599
"Return of the Jedi"? Anyone?

04:51.633 --> 04:53.000
Not important.

04:54.736 --> 04:56.637
That P.I. is very good.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.556
If there's anything you don't
want anyone to know about,

04:58.556 --> 05:01.876
- chances are he already does.
- So who are we gonna hire?

05:01.910 --> 05:05.012
Him. I got to him first,
so now he's working for us.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.098
Working?

05:07.849 --> 05:09.487
As in digging up dirt on the hospital?

05:09.487 --> 05:11.652
No, on you two.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.621
Shouldn't he be
investigating the hospital?

05:13.655 --> 05:16.757
Eventually, but right now
I wanna know where the bodies are buried.

05:16.791 --> 05:18.659
Hopefully that's just a metaphor.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.895
Great we've told you everything.

05:21.108 --> 05:24.598
Yes, but I wanna know the things
that even you don't know are out there.

05:34.910 --> 05:36.944
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

05:36.978 --> 05:38.879
- What?
- Don't look at me. Look at the road.

05:38.914 --> 05:40.981
There is no road!

05:41.648 --> 05:42.950
All right, sand trap.

05:42.984 --> 05:45.819
- Daphne, Daphne, sand trap. Sand trap!
- What?

05:50.725 --> 05:52.593
Ah. Okay.

05:52.627 --> 05:53.861
I get that your ears don't work so good,

05:53.895 --> 05:55.863
but your eyes are no picnic either.

06:00.001 --> 06:01.735
You didn't really hurt yourself, did you?

06:01.770 --> 06:03.837
No. No, I just have a bad back...

06:04.897 --> 06:05.873
pre-existing condition.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.842
A "Prius-cyst-shun"?

06:08.877 --> 06:11.812
No, pre-existing condition.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.583
I had scoliosis when I was a kid.

06:15.617 --> 06:17.145
Scoliosis?

06:18.484 --> 06:20.521
Right. Only girls get that.

06:20.555 --> 06:23.524
Yeah, that's what the kids who
made fun of me used to say.

06:24.703 --> 06:25.693
You're serious?

06:25.727 --> 06:27.695
Yeah, I was 10,

06:27.729 --> 06:29.697
had to have surgery to get it corrected.

06:30.183 --> 06:32.666
- 10?
- Yeah, it sucked.

06:32.701 --> 06:35.903
I had to wear this brace 23 hours a day...

06:35.937 --> 06:38.906
A Boston Brace, which is ironic

06:38.940 --> 06:41.453
considering I hate the Red Sox.

06:43.011 --> 06:45.779
Needless to say, I didn't do a lot
of pool parties or sleepovers.

06:46.678 --> 06:47.161
Hmm.

06:48.387 --> 06:50.684
You thought my life was
one giant keg stand.

06:50.983 --> 06:52.686
I did not.

06:54.311 --> 06:55.581
Okay, fine, I did.

06:59.359 --> 07:01.629
Your back's fine now, though, right?

07:02.864 --> 07:04.898
- Yeah.
- Good.

07:21.500 --> 07:21.882
Mmm!

07:21.916 --> 07:23.456
I'll take that one. Thank you.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.697
- Thank you very much.
- Kathryn?

07:36.731 --> 07:38.732
I thought it was you.

07:38.767 --> 07:40.701
- Nice to see you, Angelo.
- Hi.

07:41.970 --> 07:44.805
- Fennel?
- Oh, I'm making a risotto.

07:45.075 --> 07:47.708
Oh, you know what brings out
the flavor of the fennel?

07:47.742 --> 07:49.810
- Hm-mmm.
- A splash of pastis.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.879
Oh, well, it's my grandmother's recipe

07:51.913 --> 07:54.715
and you do not mess
with italian tradition.

07:54.749 --> 07:56.950
Your grandmother was italian?

07:56.985 --> 07:58.986
- Yeah.
- From where?

07:59.020 --> 08:02.656
Um, a small town... Torca.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.725
Torca? Are you joking?

08:04.759 --> 08:06.927
It's only a few kilometers from Sorrento.

08:06.961 --> 08:09.463
It's where my father's family comes from.

08:09.497 --> 08:11.498
- Really?
- Yeah, this is crazy.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.567
I mean, to think that
we might have a chance

08:13.601 --> 08:15.936
that our families have known each other.

08:16.567 --> 08:17.938
Here we are.

08:18.973 --> 08:20.098
Here we are.

08:22.115 --> 08:22.975
What is it?

08:25.547 --> 08:27.548
Your eyes... they...

08:28.717 --> 08:30.186
they remind me of Bay's.

08:31.123 --> 08:31.817
Really?

08:33.268 --> 08:34.688
Really.

08:37.669 --> 08:38.926
I... I have to go,

08:38.960 --> 08:42.730
- but it was good to see you.
- Okay.

08:51.027 --> 08:53.774
Blue is payable, red is receipts.

08:53.808 --> 08:55.609
I want you to enter the dates paid

08:55.643 --> 08:56.844
into the calendar on the computer.

08:56.878 --> 08:59.613
- Got it.
- Good.

08:59.647 --> 09:00.781
Let me get the rest of the files.

09:01.396 --> 09:03.617
- There's more?
- Oh yeah.

09:11.626 --> 09:13.594
Hi, is John here?

09:13.628 --> 09:16.563
No, he just stepped out,
but he'll be right back.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.532
You must be Daphne.

09:19.868 --> 09:21.535
I'm sorry, I'm Sarah Lazar.

09:21.569 --> 09:23.871
- I'm a friend of your dad's.
- Oh.

09:26.808 --> 09:28.742
- There's something wrong?
- No no.

09:28.777 --> 09:32.140
It's just you look so much like Kathryn.

09:32.213 --> 09:33.480
Oh.

09:34.849 --> 09:37.451
- Sweetie, I promise this is the...
- There he is.

09:37.485 --> 09:39.653
- Oh hey.
- Hi, I was just meeting Daphne.

09:39.687 --> 09:42.689
Oh great. Great.

09:42.724 --> 09:45.925
Great. Daphne, can you
give Sarah and me a minute?

09:47.662 --> 09:48.862
Um, sure.

09:53.635 --> 09:54.835
Heh. Thank you.

10:02.483 --> 10:05.579
- Hi.
- Hey, I just ran into Angelo.

10:05.613 --> 10:07.915
- Wh... what did he say?
- Nothing.

10:08.478 --> 10:10.517
Uh, it was at the farmers' market.

10:10.552 --> 10:12.820
He likes his fresh fruit and vegetables.

10:12.854 --> 10:14.755
I'm not sure I can keep
him from shopping there.

10:14.789 --> 10:17.758
No no, it was actually nice.

10:17.792 --> 10:20.158
He was... he was quite nice.

10:20.254 --> 10:22.729
- Oh.
- And I was thinking that maybe

10:22.764 --> 10:25.532
I'd invite him over for dinner.

10:26.219 --> 10:28.535
I know, I know. I just think that dinner

10:28.570 --> 10:31.361
might be a great opportunity
to start all over again.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.576
Do you think Daphne
would be okay with that?

10:36.678 --> 10:37.774
I'll have to find out.

10:38.947 --> 10:40.781
You think John'll be okay with that?

10:41.850 --> 10:43.951
I'll have to find out.

10:51.220 --> 10:52.726
Come on in.

10:53.795 --> 10:55.013
What's up?

10:57.051 --> 10:58.988
Do you know a Sarah Lazar?

10:59.734 --> 11:00.834
Where'd you hear that name?

11:00.869 --> 11:03.503
I met her today at the car wash.

11:03.538 --> 11:04.771
She came by to see your dad,

11:04.806 --> 11:08.575
but things were weird between them.

11:08.610 --> 11:10.677
It's nothing you need to worry about.

11:11.090 --> 11:12.713
But who is Sarah Lazar?

11:14.234 --> 11:15.010
Nobody.

11:16.029 --> 11:18.585
Look, she's... she's just a reporter,

11:18.620 --> 11:21.455
and dad is a famous guy.

11:21.489 --> 11:23.824
So, you know, there's
bound to be some rumors.

11:25.497 --> 11:27.527
But your mom knows about her, right?

11:27.562 --> 11:29.496
There's nothing for my mom to know.

11:29.530 --> 11:31.765
And if you think that
my dad is the kind of guy

11:31.799 --> 11:32.809
who's gonna cheat on my mom,

11:32.810 --> 11:34.868
then you clearly haven't been
in this family long enough.

12:07.202 --> 12:08.402
Aww. No.

12:08.437 --> 12:11.979
'Cause then my pores would
be the size of hubcaps.

12:13.993 --> 12:15.409
So you think

12:15.444 --> 12:19.036
that my pores need to be photoshopped?

12:21.561 --> 12:22.232
No.

12:27.389 --> 12:29.290
Oh, that is not a good idea.

12:29.324 --> 12:31.359
It's illegal street art.

12:31.393 --> 12:33.628
I'm trying to remain undercover here.

12:37.366 --> 12:39.333
Oh, funny.

12:39.505 --> 12:42.336
I just don't think that axe girl

12:42.371 --> 12:46.307
sends the best message to
your dad about your girlfriend.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.243
Oh, you know what?

12:49.278 --> 12:51.312
Maybe we'll just do a big blow-up

12:51.346 --> 12:52.613
of your mug shot.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.286
No, we're not doing that.

12:59.439 --> 13:01.556
Is this one of yours?

13:03.056 --> 13:04.425
I love it.

13:05.077 --> 13:06.227
Wow.

13:06.261 --> 13:09.297
The colors are bright,
but the lines are... rawr... angry.

13:13.468 --> 13:15.436
It was meant to be an exercise.

13:15.470 --> 13:17.438
If he's not gonna hang it,
do you mind if I buy it?

13:17.472 --> 13:19.540
- Uh, it's yours.
- Really?

13:19.575 --> 13:21.409
- Mm-hmm.
- Sweet!

13:23.212 --> 13:25.246
You are going into the dining room.

13:26.248 --> 13:29.417
Um, are you staying for dinner?

13:29.451 --> 13:31.519
Oh no, I gotta get home.

13:31.553 --> 13:34.222
Aww. You're welcome anytime,

13:34.256 --> 13:35.623
and feel free to stay here if you like.

13:35.657 --> 13:39.140
- It's totally cool.
- Umm, thanks.

13:39.140 --> 13:41.462
I mean beds are more
comfortable than the back seat.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.465
I'm gonna go now.

13:51.206 --> 13:54.442
Oh, she can't get it,
but Kennish grabs it out

13:54.476 --> 13:56.310
of the left-field stand. There you go.

13:56.345 --> 13:58.212
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:59.281 --> 14:01.349
So I email Craig,

14:01.383 --> 14:04.252
you know, making sure
his investigator's discreet

14:04.286 --> 14:06.354
if he ever contacts people we know,

14:06.388 --> 14:11.325
and he emails me back "True d-a-t."

14:12.188 --> 14:15.196
True dat, like "True that,"

14:15.230 --> 14:18.232
as in "That is true."

14:19.931 --> 14:20.826
I am so relieved one of

14:20.827 --> 14:23.304
us is young enough to
know what that means.

14:23.558 --> 14:24.760
True dat.

14:25.641 --> 14:27.475
- What should I make tomorrow?
- I don't know.

14:27.509 --> 14:30.177
Italian, french or...

14:30.212 --> 14:32.146
- Mmm.
- Both?

14:32.180 --> 14:33.614
What are you thinking?

14:35.566 --> 14:36.651
Angelo.

14:39.288 --> 14:41.222
I want to invite him over for dinner

14:41.256 --> 14:44.225
- with all of us.
- Are you serious?

14:45.227 --> 14:46.460
Yeah.

14:46.495 --> 14:48.462
If we can't sit down for a meal with him,

14:48.497 --> 14:50.398
we shouldn't be walking into a courtroom...

14:50.432 --> 14:53.301
- Is Bay asking for this?
- No, I am.

14:53.335 --> 14:57.538
I... I bumped into him at
the farmers' market and...

14:59.474 --> 15:01.375
when he laughs, his eyes, they're...

15:01.410 --> 15:03.311
they're just like Bay's.

15:05.247 --> 15:08.282
And for the first time
I could see that he is her...

15:11.253 --> 15:12.453
There's a genetic link,

15:13.856 --> 15:16.390
and like it or not,
that makes him part of this family.

15:20.077 --> 15:22.096
How does Daphne feel?

15:22.130 --> 15:24.398
- It's fine.
- Are you sure?

15:25.567 --> 15:27.468
Well, I don't think that we'll be doing

15:27.502 --> 15:29.303
"The amazing race" anytime soon,

15:29.338 --> 15:32.440
but if John and Kathryn can survive

15:32.474 --> 15:37.211
dinner with Angelo, then I can too.

15:37.801 --> 15:38.479
Okay.

15:41.936 --> 15:43.584
Angelo's better than I thought.

15:43.618 --> 15:45.032
I can't believe he managed

15:45.033 --> 15:47.154
to work his way into the Kennish house.

15:47.392 --> 15:49.593
Ma, stop. He's making an effort.

15:49.627 --> 15:51.562
Yes, because he has an agenda.

15:52.134 --> 15:54.431
He is not the man you remember.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.769
You're sleeping with him, aren't you?

16:04.315 --> 16:05.509
- Yes.
- Oh.

16:05.543 --> 16:07.998
But you know what?
This isn't any of your business.

16:08.297 --> 16:11.265
Maybe, but it is Daphne's.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.201
What's going to happen
when the girls find out?

16:16.948 --> 16:18.949
- There she is.
- Oh.

16:18.983 --> 16:21.985
So Priya and some other
girls who I won't mention...

16:22.019 --> 16:24.821
me... are dying to know how
your date with Wilke went.

16:24.855 --> 16:26.825
Honestly, kinda awesome.

16:27.191 --> 16:28.553
I don't know what I was expecting,

16:28.553 --> 16:32.963
but he was so sweet and romantic.

16:32.997 --> 16:34.998
Wow, he must really like you.

16:35.032 --> 16:37.000
On our first date,
all he did was get drunk

16:37.034 --> 16:38.556
and take me to the golf course.

16:39.971 --> 16:40.988
Yeah, me too.

16:42.940 --> 16:44.301
He took you to the golf course.

16:46.010 --> 16:49.012
Doesn't change things.
He still clearly likes you.

16:50.101 --> 16:52.412
Wait, so he took all of

16:52.412 --> 16:54.020
you to the golf course on your first date?

16:54.325 --> 16:56.593
If it makes you feel better,
he took me to world of fun.

16:58.496 --> 17:00.530
- Ugh.
- Come on, come on.

17:13.127 --> 17:13.948
Oh.

17:18.355 --> 17:20.450
It's not a nude, is it?

17:26.257 --> 17:28.692
But, I mean, is that weird?
I just met her.

17:46.957 --> 17:49.512
She thinks that we're sleeping together.

17:53.684 --> 17:56.908
I... I wouldn't know.

18:01.259 --> 18:02.584
Yes, I'm a virgin.

18:03.883 --> 18:04.661
What?

18:11.984 --> 18:14.271
Well, what are you? A vegetable?

18:16.407 --> 18:19.276
Oh. One of the other food groups.

18:22.158 --> 18:23.513
Did you do it with...

18:31.522 --> 18:33.356
I got it.

18:40.061 --> 18:41.498
No.

18:42.633 --> 18:45.635
Yes. No. I... I don't know.

18:46.399 --> 18:47.737
Is it weird that I am?

19:53.082 --> 19:56.685
Hey. When I heard you were
working at the car wash,

19:56.719 --> 19:58.754
I was hoping for a bikini
and a whole lot of suds.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.891
You get my text about this weekend?

20:03.074 --> 20:06.595
World of fun has this new
rollercoaster... the boomerang.

20:06.629 --> 20:07.963
So intense that you vomit up your lunch

20:07.997 --> 20:10.732
at the top of the loop and swallow
it back down on the bottom.

20:10.767 --> 20:12.801
And then we'll hook up
in the gravitron, right?

20:12.835 --> 20:15.937
- Wh...
- That's your big second-date move.

20:17.907 --> 20:21.977
Ah. You've been talking to
the girls on the basketball team.

20:23.038 --> 20:24.880
And some of the volleyball squad.

20:27.583 --> 20:27.916
There's only so many

20:27.950 --> 20:29.651
cool things to do in this town.

20:29.685 --> 20:31.987
It's kind of like the greatest hits.

20:32.021 --> 20:34.890
You know what? I have a
lot of work to do here.

20:34.924 --> 20:36.992
I should probably get back to it.

20:37.026 --> 20:38.960
But Daphne...

20:38.995 --> 20:40.729
Daphne!

20:47.070 --> 20:49.004
Uh...

20:50.104 --> 20:51.215
what's this?

20:59.082 --> 21:02.050
Uh, you skipped school?
Does your dad know?

21:07.931 --> 21:08.746
Wow.

21:08.813 --> 21:10.352
Can your dad write me a note

21:10.353 --> 21:12.683
to get me out of all of second semester?

21:18.342 --> 21:21.211
U mmm, uh, before I forget...

21:21.561 --> 21:22.760
and you're such a good kisser

21:22.761 --> 21:24.793
that it's a very real possibility...

21:25.612 --> 21:29.278
J. and K. invited Angelo to family dinner.

21:33.374 --> 21:34.426
Well, there's no need.

21:34.754 --> 21:37.961
There's a ringside seat
just for you. It's tonight.

21:50.178 --> 21:51.862
It might be kinda late.

22:01.667 --> 22:06.176
You mean stay-over stay over?

22:17.408 --> 22:18.406
Me too.

22:20.414 --> 22:22.731
I'll try to come by as soon as I can.

22:26.919 --> 22:28.944
Look, we set it off by accident.

22:30.054 --> 22:32.381
If I knew the code,
I wouldn't need your help!

22:35.000 --> 22:37.888
Okay, my husband changes
the code every three months

22:37.889 --> 22:39.457
and he forgot to tell us what it is.

22:39.458 --> 22:42.388
It's not his home run
record or his R.B.I. stats.

22:42.524 --> 22:44.627
Try his on-base percentage.

22:44.848 --> 22:47.828
Look, please, you have
to do something. Hurry.

22:47.857 --> 22:50.800
Please, you've gotta help us.
We're all going deaf here.

22:53.413 --> 22:55.540
Listen, if I was robbing the house,

22:55.541 --> 22:57.674
I'd be robbing the house,
not talking to you.

23:03.366 --> 23:05.066
It's Mrs. Kennish.
She's trying to get ahold of John,

23:05.067 --> 23:06.335
but he's not answering his cell.

23:06.336 --> 23:08.019
He said he went to the driving range.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.847
Daphne says he went to the driving range.

23:10.961 --> 23:13.803
Oh, okay. Well, we'll tell him
to call you when we see him.

23:14.188 --> 23:16.019
Mrs. Kennish says
she already tried the club.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.242
They said he's not there.

24:02.807 --> 24:04.648
Hey, man, I need a favor.

24:04.649 --> 24:05.455
I told you if you got

24:05.455 --> 24:07.954
a rash from the capybara
that it's your problem.

24:08.611 --> 24:09.958
I need your help with Daphne.

24:11.599 --> 24:12.525
Oh.

24:13.006 --> 24:14.943
Look, I need you to put
in a good word for me.

24:14.944 --> 24:16.816
She thinks I'm, like, this man-slut.

24:17.357 --> 24:19.025
It took her this long to figure that out?

24:19.026 --> 24:20.884
I'm serious. Daphne's got it in her head

24:20.885 --> 24:23.095
that she's just another
girl on some to-do list.

24:24.428 --> 24:25.670
Look, I really like her.

24:26.698 --> 24:27.900
Dude, you know me.

24:28.244 --> 24:29.757
Yeah, I know you, and I know that

24:29.758 --> 24:32.083
you never stick with a girl
for more than two weeks.

24:32.382 --> 24:33.584
Daphne's different.

24:33.942 --> 24:36.025
Yeah, she's different... she's my sister.

24:36.549 --> 24:37.413
I...

24:38.706 --> 24:39.751
You're a fun guy

24:39.805 --> 24:41.347
who happens to like fun girls,

24:41.348 --> 24:43.326
but there's more to Daphne than that.

24:43.410 --> 24:44.769
You think I don't know that?

24:47.664 --> 24:50.676
Oh, you don't think
there's more to me than that.

24:52.905 --> 24:53.895
Good to know.

24:57.230 --> 24:59.303
Come on, dude.
Let's just start from the top.

25:04.029 --> 25:05.832
Hey, you're home early.

25:05.833 --> 25:07.957
What, no basketball practice with John?

25:08.333 --> 25:09.235
Nope.

25:11.649 --> 25:12.751
Is everything okay?

25:13.969 --> 25:17.843
Do I have to go to this dinner thing?

25:17.844 --> 25:19.820
Oh, sweetie, of course not.

25:19.969 --> 25:23.127
No one is trying to force
you and Angelo together.

25:24.125 --> 25:25.146
It's not that.

25:26.653 --> 25:27.735
It's something else?

25:32.456 --> 25:35.667
Do you think that John
would have an affair?

25:36.985 --> 25:38.856
He lied about where he was

25:38.857 --> 25:43.231
and then I saw him with this woman.

25:44.235 --> 25:47.053
Okay, I don't know what you saw,

25:47.465 --> 25:50.270
and you know what?
Maybe it's what you think,

25:50.959 --> 25:53.852
but maybe it's not.

25:54.177 --> 25:57.025
I mean, Angelo was sure
that I had an affair,

25:57.621 --> 25:58.830
but I hadn't.

26:01.048 --> 26:02.380
I don't know what to do.

26:03.949 --> 26:07.005
I don't think
it's your place to do anything.

26:07.342 --> 26:08.905
Well, it's just that...

26:09.072 --> 26:12.483
When I was growing up and it
was just you, me and grandma,

26:13.043 --> 26:14.040
I couldn't help it.

26:14.041 --> 26:16.462
Sometimes I would wonder about

26:16.660 --> 26:18.200
what it would be like to be a part

26:18.201 --> 26:21.109
of a perfect family like the Kennishes.

26:21.633 --> 26:22.470
But...

26:23.732 --> 26:26.565
it was all just a lie.

26:28.510 --> 26:31.354
Even if John is having an affair,

26:31.613 --> 26:35.020
it doesn't mean that
he doesn't love Kathryn.

26:36.615 --> 26:37.515
These things...

26:39.291 --> 26:42.040
these things aren't black or white.

27:01.232 --> 27:03.347
Hi.

27:03.429 --> 27:04.539
Sorry I'm early.

27:04.658 --> 27:06.454
Oh no, don't worry about it.

27:06.881 --> 27:09.660
I'm sorry that the place
is a little messy.

27:09.661 --> 27:11.107
Of course, you're an artist.

27:11.327 --> 27:14.782
I'm so happy I finally get
the chance to see your studio.

27:14.898 --> 27:18.244
Uh, yeah, this is where
the oil and acrylic magic happens.

27:19.362 --> 27:21.859
So when do I get the chance

27:21.860 --> 27:24.608
- to meet the boyfriend?
- Uh, anytime.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.358
I just wanna make sure that

27:26.377 --> 27:29.151
his intentions are
honorable with my daughter.

27:29.829 --> 27:31.933
They're honorabl... ish.

27:32.123 --> 27:33.786
- Hey, Angelo.
- Oh.

27:33.842 --> 27:36.008
- Glad you could make it.
- Thank you so much for having me.

27:36.009 --> 27:39.383
- Sure.
- I just wanted to show Angelo some of my artwork.

27:39.384 --> 27:41.661
- Yeah.
- This is the piece that I'm working on right now.

27:41.662 --> 27:45.049
I was trying something new where
organic becomes mechanical

27:45.050 --> 27:47.684
and, well, mechanical becomes organic.

27:47.685 --> 27:49.767
It was inspired by H.R. Giger.

27:50.233 --> 27:52.036
Emmett is really into him.

27:52.037 --> 27:54.349
- Giger, yeah.
- Oh, you know him?

27:54.606 --> 27:56.927
Right, have you ever
seen his necronomicon?

27:57.300 --> 28:00.126
Oh, it's awesome. I have to show you.

28:02.829 --> 28:04.845
You have no idea who Giger is, do you?

28:04.846 --> 28:06.934
- No.
- Welcome to the club.

28:07.755 --> 28:09.751
- Dinner's ready.
- John: My son Toby.

28:09.752 --> 28:11.441
- Ah, the musician.
- Yes.

28:12.160 --> 28:15.478
So you are Bay's dad.

28:15.822 --> 28:18.204
- Not what you expected?
- Uh...

28:18.880 --> 28:20.946
- I guess not.
- Let me guess...

28:20.994 --> 28:23.233
Horns, pointed tail, pitchfork.

28:23.234 --> 28:24.760
I was gonna say scary clown.

28:25.580 --> 28:26.300
I'm glad Bay had

28:26.301 --> 28:28.119
a big brother to look after her.

28:29.865 --> 28:31.916
- Nice guitars.
- Toby: Oh thanks.

28:32.821 --> 28:36.137
You know, once I saw Eric Clapton
at this little bar in Austin.

28:36.138 --> 28:38.941
And he was all ready to play,
except he forgot his pick.

28:38.942 --> 28:41.625
So I reached down in my pocket,
gave him mine.

28:41.626 --> 28:43.576
- He played the whole set with it.
- No way.

28:43.577 --> 28:46.505
- Yeah.
- And you just got kicked out of the club.

28:48.154 --> 28:49.907
Please tell me you still have that pick.

28:50.268 --> 28:52.646
No, Bay does.

28:53.542 --> 28:55.774
- Okay, here it is.
- Oh, fantastic.

28:55.775 --> 28:57.743
- Oh, it smells wonderful.
- Thank you.

28:57.744 --> 28:59.368
- Regina, please.
- Thank you.

28:59.369 --> 29:00.827
I hope I made enough salad.

29:00.828 --> 29:02.738
Yeah, you made enough salad.

29:02.739 --> 29:04.595
- Angelo.
- Thank you.

29:15.938 --> 29:16.657
Hi.

29:16.658 --> 29:17.728
I'm so glad you're here.

29:26.428 --> 29:29.141
If we don't have some
kind of pleasant exchange,

29:29.142 --> 29:31.493
they're not gonna stop staring at us.

29:32.578 --> 29:33.426
Yeah.

29:36.657 --> 29:37.748
Thank you for coming.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.833
- Thank you, John.
- Welcome.

29:53.994 --> 29:55.427
So, Kathryn,

29:55.428 --> 29:59.110
I heard you had problems
with your alarm earlier.

29:59.708 --> 30:03.727
Yes, my husband changed the code
and he neglected to tell us.

30:04.186 --> 30:06.618
Honey, I don't get cell
reception on the golf course.

30:06.619 --> 30:08.824
- I told you that.
- I called the clubhouse

30:08.825 --> 30:10.685
and they said they hadn't seen you.

30:10.787 --> 30:12.898
Well, that's 'cause I didn't
check in at the clubhouse

30:12.899 --> 30:13.781
because if I had,

30:13.782 --> 30:15.952
I'd have to spend 30 minutes
talking to that caddy

30:15.953 --> 30:19.698
trying to sell me on his amazing
investment opportunities.

30:21.158 --> 30:22.975
The only reason I forgive him

30:22.976 --> 30:25.198
is that I found out that the code

30:25.528 --> 30:27.940
- is the night of our first date.
- That's right.

30:28.285 --> 30:32.022
- November 2nd, 1990.
- 1990.

30:35.424 --> 30:36.416
I got it.

30:39.930 --> 30:42.667
Mmm. Kathryn,

30:43.757 --> 30:45.683
this risotto is delicious.

30:45.684 --> 30:47.024
- Mmm.
- Thank you.

30:47.189 --> 30:49.407
The secret is the pastis.

30:55.346 --> 30:56.853
It's Craig Tebbe.

30:57.965 --> 31:00.660
- Oh.
- Actually, he asked for mom.

31:00.661 --> 31:01.682
Oh.

31:03.155 --> 31:04.260
Kathryn: Excuse me.

31:07.356 --> 31:10.250
- Hi, Craig.
- Ah. Angelo, you're empty there. May I?

31:10.264 --> 31:12.233
Oh, none for me please. Thank you.

31:12.594 --> 31:13.514
Ah.

31:16.781 --> 31:17.639
John.

31:18.929 --> 31:20.757
Can I speak with you
in the kitchen, please?

31:20.758 --> 31:22.632
Yeah, sure. Excuse me.

31:27.034 --> 31:29.712
What, did Craig's investigator
dig up something on us?

31:32.419 --> 31:34.021
Kathryn, how bad are we talking?

31:34.986 --> 31:36.126
It's not about us.

31:38.895 --> 31:40.957
There's a warrant for Angelo in Italy.

31:41.662 --> 31:42.947
He's a fugitive.

31:44.844 --> 31:45.628
What?

31:51.870 --> 31:53.859
They say you're **
for assault and battery.

31:53.979 --> 31:54.666
Why did you lie to us again?

31:54.667 --> 31:56.570
Who the hell is Adam
Sorrento, by the way?

31:56.571 --> 31:58.525
- And why do you have an alias?
- Regina: Okay, stop.

31:59.117 --> 32:01.522
- This has to be a mistake.
- No, it isn't.

32:03.819 --> 32:05.834
I needed another name for my work visa,

32:06.325 --> 32:08.745
otherwise they would not let
me back into the country.

32:08.746 --> 32:10.099
Oh, well, that's just great.

32:10.100 --> 32:12.392
Um, okay, so we can all hear you,

32:12.393 --> 32:13.233
except for Daphne,

32:13.234 --> 32:15.704
so you might as well include
us in this conversation.

32:16.323 --> 32:17.869
- Okay.
- Fine.

32:17.870 --> 32:18.681
What?

32:18.682 --> 32:19.833
Okay. Umm...

32:21.421 --> 32:23.624
When... when I was in Italy,

32:24.313 --> 32:25.412
I was engaged.

32:25.649 --> 32:29.008
And two months before the wedding,

32:29.125 --> 32:31.297
I went out celebrating
with my friend Aldo.

32:32.671 --> 32:33.503
And...

32:34.906 --> 32:37.798
we were drinking and he admits to me that

32:38.567 --> 32:40.213
he was sleeping with my fiancee.

32:43.579 --> 32:45.080
I was angry, I was drunk

32:46.909 --> 32:48.049
and I beat him...

32:50.465 --> 32:51.382
hard.

32:54.332 --> 32:56.845
And the next day I woke up in jail.

32:57.857 --> 33:00.012
The police let me go after I sobered up,

33:01.413 --> 33:04.829
but Aldo's father was a prosecutor,

33:04.830 --> 33:08.064
so he had it out for me.

33:09.631 --> 33:10.945
So you just fled.

33:15.748 --> 33:17.809
- They didn't give me any choice.
- Really?

33:28.417 --> 33:29.250
Gina.

33:32.584 --> 33:34.824
I'm telling you... they had it out for me.

33:38.022 --> 33:39.465
What are you planning to do?

33:39.982 --> 33:41.759
- I don't know.
- Leave?

33:42.042 --> 33:44.313
No, of course not.

33:49.211 --> 33:50.809
Look, it's all going to be fine.

33:51.512 --> 33:52.919
We can't just tell ourselves that.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.551
We have to face it head-on.

33:55.396 --> 33:57.812
We can get a good lawyer
and we can fight it.

33:58.240 --> 33:59.853
And how would I pay for that, Gina?

34:00.208 --> 34:01.874
All my money's been tied up.

34:04.786 --> 34:05.737
The salon.

34:09.143 --> 34:10.855
I just can't believe I got taken in.

34:10.856 --> 34:12.882
I... I invited him to dinner

34:13.172 --> 34:14.693
in my house.

34:15.556 --> 34:16.668
I feel just like I did

34:16.670 --> 34:18.742
when we found out that
Regina knew about the switch.

34:18.743 --> 34:20.827
- Honey, I'm right there with you.
- You know what?

34:20.828 --> 34:23.643
We should've trusted our first
instincts about that man.

34:23.690 --> 34:24.920
Let me tell you something...

34:25.112 --> 34:26.850
I make one phone call to immigration...

34:26.851 --> 34:28.690
bam... he is right back in Italy.

34:28.692 --> 34:31.869
If you guys have Angelo deported,
I will never forgive you.

34:37.257 --> 34:39.577
Sure that there is nothing you can do?

34:43.127 --> 34:44.315
No, I understand.

34:47.237 --> 34:51.248
- What is it?
- I can't get out of the salon lease,

34:51.597 --> 34:54.781
which means there is no way
to free up Angelo's money.

34:55.725 --> 34:58.744
Wait, you want to help him?

34:58.910 --> 35:01.790
- I don't understand.
- I don't want him deported

35:02.246 --> 35:03.475
or arrested.

35:05.036 --> 35:05.923
Do you...

35:08.413 --> 35:09.464
Are you two...

35:10.696 --> 35:11.917
back together?

35:21.479 --> 35:22.395
Having him back

35:23.132 --> 35:24.804
and seeing him again

35:25.217 --> 35:27.307
stirred up some old feelings.

35:27.461 --> 35:29.564
He walked out on you.

35:31.226 --> 35:32.729
I don't understand how you can

35:32.730 --> 35:36.253
fall back in love with someone like that.

35:38.594 --> 35:40.513
I didn't fall back in love.

35:41.365 --> 35:44.379
I think that I might never
have fallen out of it.

35:46.796 --> 35:47.841
Oh.

35:52.843 --> 35:55.147
They have no right to do this.
They just don't like him.

35:58.672 --> 35:59.199
Like what?

36:03.944 --> 36:05.896
Whose side are you on?

36:07.364 --> 36:10.092
Wow, my signing must be really bad,

36:10.093 --> 36:12.648
because it sounds like
you are defending them.

36:15.946 --> 36:18.522
He is my dad, and what about your dad?

36:18.523 --> 36:20.558
He has a bong the size of
the space needle in there!

36:21.949 --> 36:23.758
It's not the same thing, okay?

36:23.759 --> 36:27.211
Because my dad is not dating
a chick who's half his age,

36:27.212 --> 36:28.070
who incidentally has been

36:28.071 --> 36:30.991
trying to mate us like we're giant pandas.

36:35.009 --> 36:36.097
Oh, if you think there's

36:36.098 --> 36:37.900
any chance of us sleeping
together tonight,

36:37.901 --> 36:40.036
then you are higher than your dad.

36:55.271 --> 36:58.117
Oh, you cannot take a hint, can you?

36:58.369 --> 37:01.175
Tell you what... you make that shot,
I'll never bother you again...

37:01.267 --> 37:02.619
but if you miss...

37:05.434 --> 37:06.458
Two out of three.

37:08.934 --> 37:13.104
Oh! What are you, four?
You cannot do that.

37:14.594 --> 37:16.794
Listen, I am willing to
do whatever it takes.

37:16.795 --> 37:18.422
You should probably just give up.

37:18.475 --> 37:19.066
Tell me about it.

37:19.067 --> 37:21.363
I have never worked
this hard for anybody in my life.

37:21.638 --> 37:25.688
Oh, right. How hard is it to
tell some phony scoliosis story?

37:26.061 --> 37:29.163
- It's not phony.
- How come Toby didn't know anything about it?

37:30.290 --> 37:32.119
It was before I moved to Mission Hills.

37:32.432 --> 37:33.939
The reason nobody knows about it is

37:33.940 --> 37:36.638
because you're the first
person I've ever told.

37:38.130 --> 37:39.010
Oh crap.

37:40.422 --> 37:41.442
I'm sorry.

37:41.581 --> 37:45.728
You think scoliosis is something
you roll out to get chicks?

37:49.513 --> 37:51.672
Anyways, with you blabbing
about my curvy spine,

37:51.673 --> 37:55.256
I'm never gonna get another date again,
so you're stuck with me.

37:55.503 --> 37:56.498
Come on, admit it...

37:56.499 --> 37:58.827
we're pretty good together,
like ketchup and eggs.

37:58.828 --> 38:01.116
Ketchup and eggs is disgusting.

38:01.250 --> 38:02.415
Which is why that is

38:02.416 --> 38:04.240
a perfect analogy for me
and you as a couple...

38:04.241 --> 38:05.313
Not everybody gets it.

38:08.097 --> 38:10.933
All right, but I have another shot still.

38:10.934 --> 38:15.085
What, seriously?
That's not... that's not fair.

38:23.206 --> 38:24.204
Don't do it.

38:25.855 --> 38:27.588
Don't call the police on Angelo,

38:27.589 --> 38:29.405
or whoever it is you call.

38:31.806 --> 38:34.912
Uh, well, honey,
I don't really have a choice.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.093
It's a very serious matter.

38:37.318 --> 38:38.243
I know.

38:40.028 --> 38:41.620
Angelo's not perfect.

38:41.985 --> 38:42.974
And believe me, a week ago,

38:42.975 --> 38:45.323
I would've been begging
you to do it. But my mom...

38:48.440 --> 38:50.227
she's happier than she's ever been.

38:51.274 --> 38:52.493
She deserves that.

38:54.404 --> 38:55.246
Okay.

38:56.211 --> 38:59.709
I will call our attorney and
see what options we have.

39:00.437 --> 39:01.844
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:09.854 --> 39:11.383
I saw you at that cafe

39:12.630 --> 39:13.572
with that woman.

39:16.185 --> 39:18.711
You mean Sarah? Sarah's a reporter who...

39:18.712 --> 39:20.807
Why did you lie about meeting with her?

39:23.781 --> 39:28.120
- Oh no, this is not what you think it is.
- Then what is it?

39:32.367 --> 39:35.713
Sarah is writing a book about the switch.

39:36.686 --> 39:39.518
And you know how hard
your mom has been working on hers.

39:39.519 --> 39:40.823
And I was very concerned

39:40.824 --> 39:44.503
that with Sarah's experience and contacts

39:44.504 --> 39:46.398
that she'd beat your mom to the punch.

39:47.076 --> 39:49.254
I mean, come on, look, let's face it.

39:49.255 --> 39:51.870
How many "Real story"

39:51.871 --> 39:55.055
"of the switched at birth family"
books can there be out there?

39:57.056 --> 40:00.101
- A book.
- Yeah, a book.

40:02.113 --> 40:05.982
I had lunch with Sarah to
convince her not to write it.

40:09.318 --> 40:11.881
And you don't believe me.

40:15.901 --> 40:17.188
You know what? It's none of my business.

40:17.189 --> 40:19.767
- It is your business.
- In fact, I don't even wanna know.

40:20.479 --> 40:22.019
No, it... it's okay.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.811
What I'm doing isn't fair. It's stupid.

40:24.812 --> 40:26.217
- No, sweetie, it's not...
- I had this fantasy

40:26.218 --> 40:29.598
of what other people's perfect
families would be like...

40:29.599 --> 40:32.432
mom, dad, siblings, plates that matched

40:32.433 --> 40:33.975
I found you guys and I thought

40:33.976 --> 40:35.905
- I had finally...
- Okay okay okay, you're wrong.

40:36.324 --> 40:37.772
We are not perfect.

40:39.244 --> 40:40.167
I know.

40:41.863 --> 40:42.790
It's just...

40:47.119 --> 40:48.780
my dad walked out,

40:49.686 --> 40:52.477
and I always fantasized that

40:52.932 --> 40:56.077
someday he'd come back,
beg for my forgiveness

40:56.078 --> 40:58.432
and finally be the dad
that I always wanted.

40:59.602 --> 41:01.313
And instead... big twist...

41:05.247 --> 41:06.873
I got a totally new dad.

41:10.370 --> 41:11.656
My real dad.

41:15.988 --> 41:18.839
And you're afraid of what's gonna happen

41:18.840 --> 41:21.403
when he turns out to be
a schmuck too, right?

41:25.957 --> 41:26.789
Okay.

41:31.794 --> 41:33.359
I will disappoint you...

41:35.392 --> 41:36.761
I promise you that...

41:39.622 --> 41:41.092
but I won't lie to you

41:43.973 --> 41:46.890
and I will never leave.

42:01.474 --> 42:02.446
Hello?

42:04.900 --> 42:06.071
Angelo?

42:07.670 --> 42:08.852
Angelo?

42:10.932 --> 42:12.113
Angelo?

42:23.850 --> 42:26.973
He's gone. I went to Angelo's
apartment and he wasn't there.

42:26.974 --> 42:28.441
- He's gone.
- What do you mean "Gone"?

42:28.442 --> 42:30.436
His clothes were gone.
The door was kicked in.

42:30.437 --> 42:32.628
- What's going on?
- Like you don't know.

42:32.802 --> 42:35.230
- What?
- I cannot believe you did this.

42:35.231 --> 42:37.711
- Did what?
- You turned Angelo in!

42:37.712 --> 42:39.077
- You what?
- Honey?

42:39.078 --> 42:40.497
I didn't turn anybody in, okay?

42:40.498 --> 42:42.473
We were gonna help him work all this out.

42:42.474 --> 42:44.282
Stop lying to me!

42:44.283 --> 42:45.690
They're telling the truth.

42:46.491 --> 42:48.419
Your parents didn't turn Angelo in.

42:49.619 --> 42:50.711
I did.
