[helicopter flying]

01:40.099 --> 01:41.101
[radio chatter]

01:55.915 --> 01:59.185
It's so goddamn
black out there.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.755
Pilots won't come here
unless there's a new moon.

02:02.855 --> 02:04.390
No moonlight.

02:04.490 --> 02:07.126
Alisa was really freaked when
I told her I was coming here.

02:07.226 --> 02:09.094
Do yourself a favor, man.

02:09.193 --> 02:10.697
Don't call home.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.832
Like Sergeant Romesha.

02:12.932 --> 02:16.402
Fucks with his head too much
to call home, right, Ro?

02:16.502 --> 02:20.306
I'll call home when I'm on
a bird out of this valley.

02:20.406 --> 02:23.342
Until then, don't
think about your wives.

02:23.442 --> 02:25.879
[helicopter flying]

02:33.185 --> 02:35.788
Goddamn it, fuck.

02:35.889 --> 02:39.626
Sir, sir.

02:39.726 --> 02:42.394
Is he fucking
smoking hash again?

02:42.494 --> 02:44.230
Come on, Faulkner,
for fuck's sake.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.565
HUSKY 2 PILOT: Black night
X-ray, this is Husky 2.

02:46.665 --> 02:49.802
We're one minute from bringing
the boys and deliver the blow.

02:49.902 --> 02:50.903
Roger, that Husky 2.

02:51.003 --> 02:52.037
This is X-ray.

02:52.137 --> 02:53.206
Thanks for making
our troop whole.

03:06.119 --> 03:07.019
Unload on the right.

03:07.119 --> 03:08.788
Home, sweet home, warriors.

03:08.888 --> 03:10.155
All right, Sergeant.

03:10.255 --> 03:11.957
[radio chatter]

03:12.057 --> 03:13.560
Holy shit, guys, we're here.

03:16.562 --> 03:18.464
Hey, how you doing, guys?

03:18.565 --> 03:19.264
Captain!

03:19.364 --> 03:20.933
How you doing, sir?

03:21.033 --> 03:24.136
Welcome to the dark side
of the moon, gentlemen.

03:24.236 --> 03:25.438
Delighted, sir.

03:25.538 --> 03:29.609
Jesus, Yunger, get
your fucking head down.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.411
Carter?

03:32.511 --> 03:33.613
I'll get the supplies, sir.

03:37.149 --> 03:40.185
All right, real
men have arrived!

03:40.285 --> 03:42.288
Hey, Central, [inaudible].

03:42.388 --> 03:44.090
You guys are late
to the party, man.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.625
Got my fucking bunk ready?

03:45.725 --> 03:47.427
Hey, new guys, bunks with
the folded blankets are open.

03:47.527 --> 03:48.427
Make yourselves at home.

03:48.527 --> 03:50.196
Hey, you fucking pussies.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.931
Where am I bunking, cowgirl?

03:53.032 --> 03:54.533
I won't ask, if
you won't tell.

03:54.634 --> 03:55.667
Ah, shit.

03:55.768 --> 03:57.202
Picking up tricks from
the locals, I see, huh?

03:57.303 --> 03:58.104
Good to see you, man.
Good to see you, man.

03:58.204 --> 03:59.372
Good to see you, bud.

03:59.472 --> 04:01.373
God, you smell like
a bag of dicks.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.876
Well, I thought that
was the musk you like.

04:03.977 --> 04:04.877
[laughter]

04:04.977 --> 04:06.312
Hey, not that one, Cherry.

04:06.412 --> 04:07.213
That's Libert's.

04:07.313 --> 04:08.247
Find a different bunk.

04:08.347 --> 04:09.848
Who's Libert?

04:09.948 --> 04:11.017
What the fuck, man.

04:11.117 --> 04:12.885
Hey, show some
respect, goddamn it.

04:12.985 --> 04:13.986
Who's Libert?

04:14.086 --> 04:15.588
Fuck you is who he is.

04:15.688 --> 04:16.422
Put that down.

04:16.522 --> 04:18.024
Go grab your bunk right there.

04:18.124 --> 04:19.257
Grab your goddamn bunk, man.

04:19.358 --> 04:20.726
Hey, nice to meet
you, too, Sergeant.

04:20.826 --> 04:22.094
There's no way I'm going
underneath you unless it's

04:22.194 --> 04:24.263
fucking made out of titanium.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.597
You understand?
MAN: What are you talking about?

04:25.697 --> 04:26.899
I'm gonna kick that
fucking ass, man.

04:26.999 --> 04:28.901
You don't know what
muscle looks like, boy.

04:29.001 --> 04:29.868
MAN: Yeah, fuck you, too.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.237
Come here.

04:31.337 --> 04:32.538
Give me a fucking hug.

04:32.639 --> 04:34.807
MAN: Hey, you can't move
the castle diagonally.

04:34.907 --> 04:36.075
MAN: I'm your superior.

04:36.175 --> 04:37.710
I can move it however
the fuck I like.

04:40.079 --> 04:41.180
That's what I'm saying.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.048
I don't think I
would stand a chance.

04:45.183 --> 04:47.053
At least we have a garden.

04:47.153 --> 04:48.387
A real Garden of Eden.

04:48.487 --> 04:50.156
Gotta be shitting me.

04:50.256 --> 04:51.657
MAN: Look at this place.

04:51.757 --> 04:53.593
MAN: Yeah, the Taliban have
a nice fucking view of us,

04:53.693 --> 04:54.060
don't they?

04:57.496 --> 04:58.497
MAN: Fuck me, man.

04:58.597 --> 04:59.999
MAN: Fucking retarded, I know.

05:00.099 --> 05:03.068
They usually come up that
draw, on the back side,

05:03.168 --> 05:04.436
take a few fucking
shots, and then

05:04.536 --> 05:07.039
just, like, get the hell out.

05:07.139 --> 05:09.108
SCUSA: Aren't we supposed
to be on top of the mountain

05:09.208 --> 05:10.142
to win this thing?

05:10.242 --> 05:11.477
KIRK: Don't be logical, Scusa.

05:11.577 --> 05:12.879
MAN: Yeah, let's get moving.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.850
This is a joke, right?

05:17.950 --> 05:19.518
Not funny ha ha.

05:19.618 --> 05:21.020
It's more like a black comedy.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.288
Shit.

05:22.388 --> 05:23.489
I love getting fucked
in this shit bowl.

05:23.589 --> 05:24.990
Man, we're not fucked.

05:25.090 --> 05:27.259
Maybe this place is like
an opportunity, you know?

05:27.359 --> 05:29.194
Yeah, how do we protect
this piece of shit?

05:29.295 --> 05:30.296
Better question
would be "why?"

05:30.396 --> 05:31.731
What do you mean, boys?

05:31.831 --> 05:33.399
Like they say,
freedom ain't free.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.235
Tighten this
motherfucking right.

05:36.335 --> 05:37.402
Good morning.

05:37.502 --> 05:38.571
Hey there, Martin.

05:38.671 --> 05:39.805
Hello, brother Martin.

05:39.905 --> 05:40.506
Well, hello.

05:40.606 --> 05:41.841
Must be the honkies.

05:41.941 --> 05:43.309
Heard someone talking
about freedom.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.477
Speaking of a black comedy.

05:45.577 --> 05:46.712
Already at it, huh?

05:46.813 --> 05:48.381
Oh, yeah.

05:48.481 --> 05:51.083
Working on a beast, this
big motherfucker right here.

05:51.183 --> 05:52.484
How'd it get out here?

05:52.584 --> 05:54.887
Some colonel in Jalalabad
had something to prove.

05:54.987 --> 05:56.488
Brought this big
motherfucker over here

05:56.588 --> 05:58.558
through these shitty ass roads.

05:58.658 --> 06:00.793
Yeah, risked life and
limb, but just not his own.

06:00.893 --> 06:01.961
Fucking officers.

06:02.061 --> 06:03.429
Yeah, heard that story before.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.731
Yeah, it's the
Tali's favorite target.

06:05.832 --> 06:09.301
They take at least one
shot at it every day.

06:09.401 --> 06:10.636
[speaking pashto]

06:11.804 --> 06:13.973
Hey, leave that dog alone!

06:14.073 --> 06:15.141
[speaking pashto]

06:15.241 --> 06:17.042
What the fuck you doing?

06:17.142 --> 06:17.977
Hey, hey, it's OK.

06:18.077 --> 06:19.545
What the fuck was that?

06:19.645 --> 06:22.181
The dog, it has, uh, fleas.

06:22.281 --> 06:23.716
Yeah, we all
have fucking fleas.

06:23.816 --> 06:25.117
It doesn't mean you gotta
fucking kill it, motherfucker!

06:25.218 --> 06:25.851
[shouting]

06:25.952 --> 06:28.388
[gunfire]

06:32.224 --> 06:33.392
Red Dragon, contact.

06:33.492 --> 06:35.695
Taliban's firing from
the olive garden!

06:35.795 --> 06:36.462
Got it!

06:36.562 --> 06:39.031
[explosion]

06:39.132 --> 06:41.601
[gunfire]

06:42.367 --> 06:42.968
I see 'em, man.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.236
I see 'em.

06:44.336 --> 06:44.937
Fuck.

06:45.037 --> 06:47.373
Woohoo!

06:47.473 --> 06:49.875
Come on, you motherfuckers!

06:49.975 --> 06:50.809
Asshole!

06:50.909 --> 06:52.111
Fucking watch it,
fucking Yunger!

06:56.481 --> 06:57.683
What do we got?

06:57.783 --> 06:59.251
Sir, we've got RPGs
from the Olive Garden

06:59.351 --> 07:02.221
and a fuck load of rifle fire.

07:02.321 --> 07:04.223
Damn.

07:04.323 --> 07:05.591
Bundy won again, huh?

07:05.691 --> 07:06.759
I'm fucking out, Ro.

07:06.859 --> 07:07.727
What?

07:07.827 --> 07:09.094
Ugh, I only brought
my starter belt!

07:09.194 --> 07:10.663
Mace, mace, we need more 240!

07:10.763 --> 07:12.698
Give me that
2-fucking-40, Mace!

07:12.798 --> 07:15.401
This is LRAS 2, we
need more ammo, over!

07:15.501 --> 07:17.770
Let's show 'em some
love with the 1-20s.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.204
Willie and Pete.

07:19.305 --> 07:20.640
[shouting]

07:20.740 --> 07:21.107
Carter!

07:25.044 --> 07:25.945
Can I help you, Carter?

07:26.045 --> 07:27.980
What the fuck you
doing with my 240?

07:28.080 --> 07:29.014
What the fuck you mean?

07:29.114 --> 07:31.350
Where the fuck is
my 240 ammo, a man?

07:31.450 --> 07:32.918
Mace said LRAS 2,
which is a 50 cal.

07:33.019 --> 07:33.452
Bullshit.

07:33.552 --> 07:34.486
I said 240!

07:34.586 --> 07:36.121
Go get my fucking ammo, man!

07:36.222 --> 07:37.222
Well, then why
didn't you say--

07:37.322 --> 07:38.491
I fucking did!

07:38.591 --> 07:39.358
Stop talking, and
go get the right ammo.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.126
Go, go!

07:41.226 --> 07:42.161
Fucking Carter.

07:42.261 --> 07:43.396
I mean, do your fucking job!

07:43.496 --> 07:44.797
Mortars, this is X-ray.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.565
Co wants you to put some
1-20s in the Olive Garden.

07:46.665 --> 07:48.334
I'll say again, 1-20s
in the Olive Garden.

07:48.434 --> 07:49.502
Over.

07:49.602 --> 07:50.469
Thomson, we got
Olive Garden, baby.

07:50.569 --> 07:51.670
Here we fucking go again!

07:51.770 --> 07:53.272
Let's light these
motherfuckers up!

07:53.372 --> 07:55.775
[explosion]

07:56.342 --> 07:58.210
[gunfire]

07:58.310 --> 07:59.478
Whoa, ceasefire.

07:59.578 --> 08:01.781
Mace, ceasefire!

08:01.881 --> 08:02.481
We got 'em.

08:02.582 --> 08:03.315
MAN: Woo!

08:03.415 --> 08:04.350
Good job, fellas.

08:04.450 --> 08:05.250
MAN: Oh, he gone.

08:05.350 --> 08:06.385
MAN: Hey, baby!

08:06.485 --> 08:07.453
Well, that really
blew some minds.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.020
MAN: Damn, that's cold, bro.

08:09.121 --> 08:09.989
Too soon?

08:10.089 --> 08:12.057
Mortaritaville
saves the day again.

08:12.157 --> 08:13.425
This is Red 2.

08:13.525 --> 08:14.226
End of mission.

08:14.326 --> 08:15.627
Target destroyed.

08:15.727 --> 08:18.230
Thank you for your
service, D-Rod and Thomson.

08:18.330 --> 08:21.266
Oh, man, that
was the shit, man.

08:21.366 --> 08:22.568
I got it all.

08:22.668 --> 08:23.402
You wait till you see
this footage, boys.

08:23.502 --> 08:24.336
Yunger, you dick!

08:24.437 --> 08:26.104
[groaning]

08:26.205 --> 08:27.239
[coughing]

08:27.339 --> 08:28.140
MAN: Uh-oh.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.107
Welcome home, Cherry.

08:29.207 --> 08:30.643
You listen to me, Yunger.

08:30.743 --> 08:33.845
You ever a fucking fire a
weapon to me that close again,

08:33.946 --> 08:35.715
and I'll fucking
kill you myself.

08:35.815 --> 08:36.615
ROMESHA: Gallegos, stop.

08:36.715 --> 08:37.448
Fucking understand me?

08:37.549 --> 08:38.918
ROMESHA: Gallegos!

08:39.018 --> 08:39.684
Fuck you, Yunger.

08:42.587 --> 08:43.556
SCUSA: You OK, Yunger?
YUNGER: I'm fine.

08:43.655 --> 08:44.890
SCUSA: You good, man?

08:44.991 --> 08:46.124
Goddamn Cherry shoots
over my fucking head.

08:46.224 --> 08:47.092
Hey, Yunger.

08:47.192 --> 08:48.427
ROMESHA: All right, guys.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.028
GALLEGOS: What, he could
have fucking killed me!

08:50.128 --> 08:52.030
Get up, get up.

08:52.130 --> 08:53.799
GALLEGOS: What, are
you his mother now, Ro?

08:53.899 --> 08:55.067
We all learn lessons out here.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.168
GALLEGOS: Leave that
fucker in the dirt.

08:56.268 --> 08:57.035
You're doing good, kid.

08:57.135 --> 08:57.603
I'm cool, Sergeant.

08:57.703 --> 08:58.570
I'm Sergeant.

08:58.670 --> 08:59.739
MAN: You're cool, Yunger.

08:59.839 --> 09:00.772
GALLEGOS: Ah,
check it out, Mace.

09:00.872 --> 09:02.608
Here comes my fucking 240 ammo.

09:02.708 --> 09:03.642
Typical Carter.

09:03.742 --> 09:05.110
GALLEGOS: What a fucking day.

09:05.210 --> 09:07.479
Is that it?

09:07.579 --> 09:08.648
Is that all?

09:12.251 --> 09:14.820
You can't argue and
fight at the same time.

09:14.920 --> 09:15.921
What?

09:16.021 --> 09:18.390
You can't argue and
fight at the same time.

09:18.490 --> 09:19.091
Don't do it again.

09:21.994 --> 09:22.595
Go on.

09:26.365 --> 09:27.299
Whatever.

09:27.399 --> 09:28.400
It's not gonna work that way.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.068
Get back here.

09:35.741 --> 09:36.842
Go to parade rest.

09:42.614 --> 09:43.815
Repeat after me.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.485
"I will not argue and
fight at the same time."

09:46.586 --> 09:49.455
I will not argue and
fight at the same time.

09:49.555 --> 09:50.990
Sound off this time.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.091
I will not argue.

09:52.191 --> 09:53.092
Sound off!

09:53.192 --> 09:54.293
I will not argue.

09:54.393 --> 09:55.594
Let's not ruin a beautiful
morning, gentlemen.

09:55.694 --> 09:56.662
And fight.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.663
Thank you for your service.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.630
Thank you for your service.

09:58.730 --> 09:59.765
At the same time.

09:59.865 --> 10:01.099
MAN: Medic needs
a fucking litter!

10:01.199 --> 10:02.067
MAN: Aw, fuck!

10:02.167 --> 10:03.235
Fucking move!

10:03.335 --> 10:04.302
You're gonna be OK, man.
You're gonna be OK.

10:04.402 --> 10:05.137
You're gonna be OK.

10:05.237 --> 10:06.538
Jacobs, come on.

10:06.638 --> 10:08.306
Stay with us, pal.

10:08.406 --> 10:09.274
Doc, what you need?

10:09.374 --> 10:10.443
Just keep everyone back.

10:10.543 --> 10:11.576
Jacobs, you're
gonna be all right.

10:11.676 --> 10:13.412
I'm gonna need
a fucking litter!

10:13.512 --> 10:15.448
I lost two of my
brother's back home,

10:15.548 --> 10:16.848
fucking gang banging.

10:16.948 --> 10:20.653
They looked just
fucking like that.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.588
I told you this
place is a shithole.

10:22.688 --> 10:23.489
Yeah.

10:23.589 --> 10:24.490
Well, it's ours now.

10:24.590 --> 10:25.924
I'm coming, I'm coming.

10:26.024 --> 10:27.325
Jesus, what the fuck happened?

10:27.425 --> 10:28.360
The motherfuckers.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.228
All right, what do you need?

10:30.328 --> 10:31.130
That's it, this way.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.002
It's all you, Larson.

10:37.102 --> 10:38.904
My bad.

10:39.005 --> 10:41.673
MAN (ON RADIO): Jacobs
got out of surgery OK.

10:41.774 --> 10:43.642
They even say he's gonna
fucking come back here.

10:43.742 --> 10:44.843
MAN 2 (ON RADIO):
Holy shit, man.

10:44.943 --> 10:46.545
The guy lost half
his fucking face.

10:46.645 --> 10:47.579
Out.

10:47.679 --> 10:49.214
That's fucking unbelievable.

10:49.314 --> 10:51.951
There's no way I thought he'd be
back out here after that shit.

10:52.051 --> 10:53.953
Jacobs is a squared
away dude, man.

10:54.053 --> 10:56.288
Squared away ain't got nothing
to do with it, ham balls.

10:56.388 --> 10:57.122
You're a cherry.

10:57.222 --> 10:57.689
You're a private.

10:57.789 --> 10:58.591
You don't know.

10:58.691 --> 10:59.558
Fenty was squared away.

10:59.658 --> 11:00.960
Fritchy was squared away.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.494
Snail.

11:02.594 --> 11:03.828
Who's Snail?

11:03.929 --> 11:06.065
Snail was one of the
best soldiers we knew.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.700
And just like that, he was
shot in the face in Iraq,

11:08.800 --> 11:09.935
out of nowhere.

11:10.035 --> 11:11.103
Yeah.

11:11.203 --> 11:14.940
Doesn't matter what
kind of soldier you are.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.408
Good, bad.

11:16.508 --> 11:20.345
As far as I'm concerned, we all
stay alive out here, we win.

11:20.445 --> 11:23.749
You guys got any other
charges for the shitters?

11:23.849 --> 11:24.783
By the wack shack, man.

11:24.883 --> 11:25.751
There's an ammo can full of 'em.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.320
Take 'em all.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.422
[prayer in the distance]

11:30.522 --> 11:32.557
Jesus, call to prayer.

11:32.657 --> 11:33.893
Five times a fucking day, man.

11:33.993 --> 11:36.529
Ro, you in or you out?

11:36.629 --> 11:37.696
MAN: I'll play for him.

11:37.796 --> 11:38.964
MAN: I'll take two.

11:39.064 --> 11:39.899
MAN: Sit here, look
through these cards.

11:42.735 --> 11:45.171
[prayer in the distance]

11:47.606 --> 11:50.442
Smoking hash isn't the answer.

11:50.542 --> 11:51.476
There's only 54 of us.

11:51.577 --> 11:52.511
That's it.

11:52.611 --> 11:54.947
And we all count on each other.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.483
You being high out there
endangers all of us.

11:58.583 --> 12:00.919
It's not gonna
happen again, sir.

12:01.019 --> 12:02.388
You're not the only
one who came here

12:02.488 --> 12:05.557
with substance abuse issues.

12:05.657 --> 12:08.660
You're the only
one who persists.

12:08.760 --> 12:09.862
I should kick you out of here--

12:09.962 --> 12:11.196
I don't have a
substance abuse issue.

12:11.296 --> 12:13.332
Yes, you do.

12:13.432 --> 12:14.033
You do.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.938
I'm busting you down to
private, and you're burning

12:20.038 --> 12:21.340
shit till I tell you to stop.

12:25.977 --> 12:28.547
One more chance, OK?

12:28.647 --> 12:29.515
Sir.

12:29.615 --> 12:32.150
You're dismissed.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.752
Thank you, sir.

12:33.852 --> 12:36.521
Evening, sir.

12:36.621 --> 12:39.357
Maybe he should
forfeit some pay.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.227
Pay don't mean nothing
to these guys out here.

12:45.230 --> 12:49.802
You take away their free time,
it's like being in prison.

12:49.902 --> 12:52.138
[chattering]

12:52.738 --> 12:55.274
Hi, guys.

12:55.374 --> 12:57.710
Hey, hey, listen up.

12:57.810 --> 12:58.410
Hello!

13:00.913 --> 13:02.280
Is this thing working?

13:02.381 --> 13:02.881
Yes, sir.

13:02.981 --> 13:04.550
Loud and clear.

13:04.650 --> 13:07.452
The army made it, nope.

13:07.552 --> 13:08.420
This everybody?

13:08.521 --> 13:09.287
Yes, sir.

13:09.387 --> 13:09.955
OK.

13:13.225 --> 13:17.663
Look, we're making great
progress here in Kamdesh,

13:17.763 --> 13:21.767
but we still got a
lot of work to do.

13:21.867 --> 13:24.870
Our outpost, still a
target of insurgents,

13:24.970 --> 13:26.905
in case you hadn't noticed.

13:27.005 --> 13:29.074
Hm, oh, right.

13:29.174 --> 13:32.845
So how do we do our
jobs and stay safe?

13:35.681 --> 13:39.184
We need to keep a good
relationship with the locals.

13:39.284 --> 13:41.387
Hm?

13:41.487 --> 13:43.455
Respect keeps us safe.

13:46.091 --> 13:48.827
So we'll call for another shura.

13:48.927 --> 13:52.063
The lead elders in the
valley will attend.

13:52.163 --> 13:56.068
They will bring some of
the younger men with them,

13:56.168 --> 13:58.670
probably some of those assholes
who've been shooting at us.

13:58.770 --> 13:59.571
MAN: That's right.

13:59.671 --> 14:00.239
You know they are.

14:03.508 --> 14:07.279
I will continue to speak
softly in the valley,

14:07.379 --> 14:09.548
offering more projects
and handshakes.

14:13.118 --> 14:17.055
But on the other hand,
I will carry all of you

14:17.155 --> 14:18.791
like a big fucking stick.

14:18.891 --> 14:19.825
MAN: Fuck, yeah, sir.

14:19.925 --> 14:20.826
Sir.

14:20.926 --> 14:22.160
Only way this thing works.

14:22.261 --> 14:23.695
I'm afraid you don't
have a big enough stick.

14:23.795 --> 14:24.696
That's right.

14:24.796 --> 14:25.397
All right.

14:28.766 --> 14:30.336
With your shield or on it.

14:30.436 --> 14:31.937
On our shields, sir.

14:32.037 --> 14:32.871
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

14:32.972 --> 14:33.572
Yes, sir.

14:36.608 --> 14:37.275
Salam alaykum.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.244
Salam alaykum.

14:39.344 --> 14:39.912
Salam alaykum.

14:44.616 --> 14:46.051
[speaking pashto]

14:52.524 --> 14:54.326
Carter, Griffin.

14:54.426 --> 14:55.160
Sir.

14:55.260 --> 14:57.829
Sir.

14:57.929 --> 14:58.931
You boys are joining me.

15:02.801 --> 15:04.403
Sir, some of those
dudes are armed.

15:04.503 --> 15:06.038
I noticed.

15:06.138 --> 15:09.107
Sir, there is a
price on your head.

15:09.207 --> 15:10.809
That's why you're joining me.

15:10.909 --> 15:14.546
Keep your alien
invader costumes on.

15:14.646 --> 15:16.548
fuck the cigarette.

15:16.648 --> 15:18.984
Sorry, Dad.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.020
[speaking pashto]

15:28.861 --> 15:29.928
He says, "why
have you come here?"

15:30.028 --> 15:31.931
[speaking pashto]

15:34.566 --> 15:36.335
He says you haven't
been here for 40 years.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.769
No, no.

15:37.869 --> 15:38.837
[speaking pashto]

15:38.937 --> 15:40.072
That was the Russians.

15:40.172 --> 15:40.839
[speaking pashto]

15:40.939 --> 15:41.673
We're American.

15:41.773 --> 15:43.308
[speaking pashto]

15:43.409 --> 15:43.909
American.

15:44.009 --> 15:45.276
[speaking pashto]

15:45.377 --> 15:46.545
They really not
understand this

15:46.645 --> 15:47.879
or they just fucking with me?

15:47.979 --> 15:48.580
[speaking pashto]

15:49.447 --> 15:50.749
Sir, it's 556.

15:50.849 --> 15:54.086
It's one of our bullets.

15:54.186 --> 15:57.189
Our job is to
separate the Taliban

15:57.289 --> 15:58.990
and the ordinary people.

15:59.090 --> 16:00.092
[speaking pashto]

16:01.193 --> 16:02.094
We do that, the
ordinary people won't

16:02.194 --> 16:02.928
get caught in the crossfire.

16:03.028 --> 16:04.129
[speaking pashto]

16:05.363 --> 16:10.002
I can give you
money, contracts,

16:10.102 --> 16:13.805
projects, if you help.

16:13.905 --> 16:16.075
[speaking pashto]

16:22.747 --> 16:23.682
You know what this means?

16:23.782 --> 16:25.384
[speaking pashto]

16:26.451 --> 16:27.853
This man fired
his rifle yesterday.

16:27.953 --> 16:29.087
[speaking pashto]

16:29.187 --> 16:30.756
We were attacked yesterday.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.491
[speaking pashto]

16:32.591 --> 16:34.860
I must report the
attack on my outpost.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.462
[speaking pashto]

16:37.862 --> 16:39.398
I will lose honor--

16:39.498 --> 16:40.031
[speaking pashto]

16:40.131 --> 16:41.099
--With my elders.

16:41.199 --> 16:42.468
[speaking pashto]

16:43.501 --> 16:46.538
I can regain my
honor in two ways.

16:46.638 --> 16:47.239
[speaking pashto]

16:48.574 --> 16:50.542
One way is for all of
you to lay down your arms--

16:50.642 --> 16:51.210
[speaking pashto]

16:52.811 --> 16:54.345
--And watch as
your communities

16:54.445 --> 16:57.883
flourish with the help of
the United States and Allah.

16:57.983 --> 16:59.385
[speaking pashto]

17:03.221 --> 17:06.992
And what is the other way?

17:07.092 --> 17:08.693
Why get into such ugliness?

17:08.792 --> 17:09.627
[speaking pashto]

17:11.262 --> 17:14.900
And of course, the United
States will compensate anyone--

17:15.000 --> 17:16.402
[speaking pashto]

17:17.603 --> 17:18.537
--Lays down their arms.

17:20.271 --> 17:21.940

shot at us yesterday.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.541
You wanna let 'em go?

17:23.642 --> 17:25.544
Yes, I do.

17:25.644 --> 17:27.079
[speaking pashto]

17:47.999 --> 17:51.070
[speaking pashto]

18:05.817 --> 18:06.652
You are a good guest.

18:09.187 --> 18:10.823
We will call you "Amat."

18:15.660 --> 18:17.596
"Highly praised."

18:17.696 --> 18:19.832
[speaking pashto]

18:25.904 --> 18:26.872
I love you.

18:26.972 --> 18:27.606
I love you.

18:27.706 --> 18:28.440
I love you.

18:28.540 --> 18:29.474
I love you.

18:29.574 --> 18:30.642
If you don't say
it like you mean it,

18:30.742 --> 18:31.176
you'll be there all night.

18:31.276 --> 18:31.810
I love you.

18:31.910 --> 18:32.544
Louder.

18:32.644 --> 18:34.479
I love you!

18:34.579 --> 18:35.079
Holy shit, man!

18:35.179 --> 18:35.747
What the fuck?

18:41.420 --> 18:44.022
Fuck.

18:44.122 --> 18:46.925
Doing this gives
you fucking cancer.

18:47.025 --> 18:47.926
Cancer?

18:48.026 --> 18:49.227
You fucking serious?

18:49.327 --> 18:50.295
Well, shit, who knows
what these assholes

18:50.395 --> 18:51.629
are shitting out.

18:51.730 --> 18:55.467
Could stop while I got
my fucking face in it?

18:55.567 --> 18:58.837
Shit detail is the
Agent Orange of today.

18:58.937 --> 19:02.073
Just stop talking, man.

19:02.173 --> 19:05.377
Doing should be against UCMJ.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.812
This shit gives you cancer.

19:07.912 --> 19:11.116
Fucking kills you.

19:11.216 --> 19:13.552
[chuckling]

19:14.352 --> 19:15.653
What's so funny, Carter?

19:15.753 --> 19:18.590
Hey, this ain't no fucking
laughing matter, man.

19:18.690 --> 19:22.694
That you think it's cancer
that's going to kill you.

19:22.794 --> 19:24.262
Yeah, he fucking
got you there, Mace.

19:24.362 --> 19:25.597
Good of you to
make it, Faulkner.

19:27.865 --> 19:28.900
What's that?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.502
Late as always.

19:31.602 --> 19:33.939
I was thinking of charges
for Mortaritaville, asshole.

19:36.641 --> 19:38.910
Well, fucking done here, man.

19:39.010 --> 19:39.911
I've seen the pictures, bro.

19:40.011 --> 19:41.279
She's a classy lady.

19:41.379 --> 19:42.514
They've been making the rounds.

19:42.614 --> 19:44.616
Classy?

19:44.716 --> 19:45.250
What the fuck?

19:45.350 --> 19:45.984
They're good, man.

19:46.084 --> 19:47.085
Shit.

19:47.185 --> 19:49.154
Look, fuck it, anyway.

19:49.254 --> 19:50.822
I'm remarrying the
woman I divorced.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.225
And she's pregnant by
some other fucking dude.

19:53.325 --> 19:55.193
Yeah, well, have
fun with that, buddy.

19:55.293 --> 19:57.062
I'll raise the kid
like they're my own.

19:57.162 --> 19:57.996
Great idea.

19:58.096 --> 19:59.564
Huh.

19:59.664 --> 20:02.334
I never really took you for
the saint type there, Gallegos.

20:02.434 --> 20:03.735
Love is love, Hardt.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.504
Love is fucking love.

20:05.604 --> 20:06.604
I hear you.

20:06.704 --> 20:07.305
There he is.

20:07.405 --> 20:09.441
Camel lights, right?

20:09.541 --> 20:10.876
Thanks.

20:10.976 --> 20:11.877
These are not Camel Lights.

20:19.117 --> 20:22.420
Hey, Taliban motherfuckers!

20:22.520 --> 20:26.090
Not so tough without
night vision, huh?

[pop music playing]

20:28.560 --> 20:30.229
(SINGING): Party every day.

20:34.666 --> 20:35.834
I love you.

20:35.934 --> 20:36.601
Hey, Mace.

20:36.701 --> 20:37.802
Yes, Sergeant?

20:37.902 --> 20:40.205
Trying to wake up all
of fucking Nuristan here?

20:40.305 --> 20:42.006
Sorry, Sergeant.

20:42.106 --> 20:43.742
You smell like dog shit, Mace.

20:43.842 --> 20:45.677
Thank you, Sergeant.

20:45.777 --> 20:46.311
I love you.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.546
I love you.

20:47.646 --> 20:48.212
I love you.

20:48.312 --> 20:49.848
Love is in the air.

[chuckling]

20:53.218 --> 20:54.686
Oh, shit.

20:54.786 --> 20:56.355
Goddamn, Mace.

20:56.455 --> 20:58.923
I picture you more of
like a name tag kind of guy.

20:59.023 --> 21:00.091
Like a waitress.

21:00.191 --> 21:01.759
I was a Home Depot salesman.

21:01.859 --> 21:04.563
Was that Before or after you
got kicked out of the Marines?

21:04.663 --> 21:05.030
Here you go.

21:05.130 --> 21:06.431
Thanks.

21:06.531 --> 21:09.234
I didn't get kicked out
of the Marines, Sergeant.

21:09.334 --> 21:13.371
I got demoted for fighting.

21:13.471 --> 21:15.139
I had a little bit of a
temper problem back then,

21:15.239 --> 21:16.674
so I got out.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.310
So you took your marine
skills to Home Depot?

21:19.410 --> 21:22.781
No, then I was
a cook at Denny's.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.449
I was a lumberjack,
projectionist

21:24.549 --> 21:25.783
at my local theater.

21:25.884 --> 21:29.087
And then I was a sales
associate at Home Depot,

21:29.187 --> 21:31.523
but only at Christmas
time, Sergeant.

21:31.623 --> 21:34.425
After that, I cleaned, helped
take care of the elderly,

21:34.525 --> 21:37.862
worked on cars for a
little while as a mechanic.

21:37.962 --> 21:40.699
Not certified, but still
a fucking mechanic.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.201
I was a barnacle sweeper
for a small period of time.

21:43.301 --> 21:47.338
After that, I was lugging around
hot tubs to different houses,

21:47.438 --> 21:50.142
but we call them hot
tub transporters.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.277
then the Army took me.

21:52.377 --> 21:53.378
I love you.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.579
You hearing this guy?

21:54.679 --> 21:55.613
Remind me not to
stand next to him

21:55.713 --> 21:57.115
in the middle of a firefight.

21:57.215 --> 21:58.216
Excuse me, Sergeant?

21:58.316 --> 21:59.818
You heard me, Carter.

21:59.918 --> 22:02.453
OK, OK, we're gonna settle
this Mini-Me and Gary Coleman

22:02.553 --> 22:04.655
argument once and for all.

22:04.755 --> 22:09.227
And, uh, no
temper problem now?

22:09.327 --> 22:11.796
Carter?

22:11.896 --> 22:14.466
Oh, I love you.

22:14.566 --> 22:16.934
Touch glove, make love.

is it gonna be?

navigate these shit ass roads.

get used to the queen's
pheromones and don't kill her.

I wouldn't touch anybody else's
fucking honey except my own.

25:36.101 --> 25:38.570
And hear I thought we'd run
out of things to talk about.

25:42.106 --> 25:42.673
Don't worry.

you to call home, Ro.

25:53.484 --> 25:54.819
No, no.

25:54.919 --> 25:57.221
I call home, and-- and
I'll end up doing is lying.

make us friends, Carter.

for it, Sergeant.

what happens around here.

of your shit, OK?

27:58.242 --> 27:59.810
You wanna know why
no one likes you?

27:59.910 --> 28:01.679
It's because you're
always the odd man out.

fucking sidelines.

shit," Larson's right.

they can trust you.

I'm a specialist.

29:18.589 --> 29:21.359
Ready, aim, fire.

29:21.459 --> 29:23.428
Ready, aim, fire.

29:49.787 --> 29:52.089
God, please watch
over him and grant

29:52.189 --> 29:55.093
him passage into the next life.

29:55.193 --> 29:55.794
Amen.

30:08.906 --> 30:10.341
All right, guys.

30:10.441 --> 30:11.009
Back to work.

30:17.848 --> 30:20.351
[helicopter flying]

30:23.388 --> 30:26.123
I pledge allegiance
to your pussy.

30:26.223 --> 30:27.825
Time's almost up, Griff.

30:27.925 --> 30:30.427
Specialist.

30:30.528 --> 30:32.930
Is that how mama taught
you how to wear panties?

30:33.030 --> 30:36.801
Griffin, this is your new
commander, Captain Yllescas.

30:36.901 --> 30:38.302
How are you doing, sir?

30:38.402 --> 30:39.803
[chuckling]

30:39.904 --> 30:42.506
Sir, those were Maria
Kirilenko's tennis star.

30:42.607 --> 30:45.209
She sent 'em as a gift,
if you can believe that.

30:45.309 --> 30:46.177
Is that right?

30:46.277 --> 30:47.178
Ah, well, who needs
Toby Keith, when

30:47.278 --> 30:48.679
you can fucking sniff those.

30:48.779 --> 30:49.880
Yeah, we're a little short
on recreation around here.

30:49.980 --> 30:50.748
Chris Cordova.

30:50.848 --> 30:51.582
Hey, Rob Yllescas.

30:51.682 --> 30:52.583
Nice to meet you.

30:52.683 --> 30:53.584
And this is Dr. Courville.

30:53.684 --> 30:54.718
Ah, good to meet you, sir.

30:54.818 --> 30:56.353
Griffin, help
him with his begs.

30:56.453 --> 30:57.321
Ah, yes, sir.

30:57.421 --> 30:58.022
Thanks.

31:00.457 --> 31:03.093
To ever think we were
enemies with the Russians.

31:03.193 --> 31:04.862
I guess the guys come in
here a lot for these, huh?

31:04.962 --> 31:06.998
That and the working
internet, sometimes.

31:07.098 --> 31:08.299
What do you guys
deal with here mostly?

31:08.399 --> 31:10.534
Ah, it's mostly
aid to the locals.

31:10.634 --> 31:14.539
Gunshot wounds when the
assholes are firing at us.

31:14.639 --> 31:15.840
You guys got a MASCAL plan?

31:15.940 --> 31:17.341
It's not fucking good.

31:17.441 --> 31:20.077
We got this room for two and
the cafe outside for two.

31:20.177 --> 31:21.678
We can't refrigerate blood.

31:21.778 --> 31:23.180
Once we drop the 9 line, it's
almost two hours before we get

31:23.280 --> 31:26.950
any helos in for here medevacs.

31:27.050 --> 31:28.319
All right, what can I do?

31:28.419 --> 31:30.487
You can close this
damn place down.

31:30.587 --> 31:31.822
Amen to that.

31:31.922 --> 31:34.558
Over here are ANA troops.

31:34.658 --> 31:36.794
In the back is our mortar pit.

31:36.894 --> 31:37.495
Sir.

31:37.595 --> 31:38.830
Oh, Lakis.

31:38.930 --> 31:40.398
He's our ANA trainer.

31:40.498 --> 31:41.032
Nice to meet you.

31:41.132 --> 31:42.366
Nice to meet you.

31:42.467 --> 31:43.534
I'm your, uh, coalition
force from Latvia, sir.

31:43.634 --> 31:44.501
Great.

31:44.601 --> 31:45.903
How are the ANA soldiers?

31:46.003 --> 31:48.139
Some of them
are OK, when I can

31:48.239 --> 31:49.974
get them off of their asses.

31:50.074 --> 31:53.544
The 6th Kandek don't have
the best reputation, sir.

31:53.644 --> 31:56.380
Hey, it's your chance to put
your leadership on display.

31:56.480 --> 31:57.614
Embrace the suck.

31:57.714 --> 31:59.751
Embarrass the suck?

31:59.851 --> 32:01.953
Like I was saying,
our mortar pit,

32:02.053 --> 32:04.889
those guys Thomson,
Rodriguez, Breeding, they

32:04.989 --> 32:06.290
really save our asses, sir.

32:06.391 --> 32:07.425
That so?

32:07.525 --> 32:08.393
Yeah.

32:08.493 --> 32:10.161
Yeah, it's all
numbers and angles.

32:10.261 --> 32:12.930
The mortars are the only thing
that reach that ridge line.

32:13.030 --> 32:14.465
Without 'em, we're fucked.

32:14.565 --> 32:15.699
KIRK: Hey, brother Ro.

32:15.799 --> 32:16.367
Oh, perfect.

32:16.467 --> 32:17.268
Kirk.

32:17.368 --> 32:18.336
KIRK: Yeah.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.872
He's one of our best
team leaders, sir.

32:20.972 --> 32:22.340
Meet Captain Yllescas.

32:22.440 --> 32:22.840
Nice to meet you.

32:22.940 --> 32:23.874
Sir.

32:23.974 --> 32:25.009
I wish we don't have to meet.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.644
I'll try to live
up to all that.

32:26.744 --> 32:27.879
Good to have you, sir.

32:27.979 --> 32:28.846
Grab a fucking sponge.

32:28.946 --> 32:29.881
Get my back.

32:29.981 --> 32:31.783
Yeah, fuck yourself.

32:31.883 --> 32:34.518
Over here is our mosque.

32:34.618 --> 32:36.921
[explosion]

32:37.021 --> 32:38.922
MAN: Return fire!

32:39.022 --> 32:40.491
Motherfuckers!

32:40.591 --> 32:41.492
Goddamn it, shit!

32:41.592 --> 32:43.894
MAN: Treetops!

32:43.994 --> 32:46.597
[inaudible]

32:46.697 --> 32:47.798
Brace yourself, boys!

32:47.898 --> 32:48.466
Get up!

32:55.973 --> 32:58.809
Hey, what do you think?

32:58.909 --> 33:00.377
You think new boss
is gonna make us

33:00.477 --> 33:02.480
do a fucking patrol every time
they take a pot shot at us?

33:02.580 --> 33:04.615
Never try to
understand officer, Mace.

33:04.715 --> 33:06.184
A different breed.

33:06.284 --> 33:07.551
They even fuck
with the lights on.

33:07.651 --> 33:09.620
Goddamn it, quit
your bitching, man.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.122
This ain't so bad.

33:12.222 --> 33:14.191
Fucking nature walk
with God, right, boys?

33:14.291 --> 33:16.527
If God was real,
then these guys

33:16.627 --> 33:18.462
wouldn't be trying to
kill us every goddamn day

33:18.562 --> 33:20.131
and Keating would
still be around here.

33:20.231 --> 33:21.732
God works in mysterious
ways, Sergeant.

33:21.832 --> 33:25.202
Yeah, so I guess God's
plan is our chaos, then, huh?

33:25.302 --> 33:27.104
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

33:27.204 --> 33:29.073
What you looking at, Sergeant?

33:29.173 --> 33:30.674
Seeing what they say.

33:30.774 --> 33:33.110
GALLEGOS: What's that, Ro?

33:33.210 --> 33:35.379
Dead Americans.

33:35.479 --> 33:39.216
Goddamn, you're a
fucking buzzkill, man.

33:39.317 --> 33:40.351
Every time they
take a pot shot

33:40.451 --> 33:42.686
at us, they're figuring us out.

33:42.786 --> 33:46.524
When the big one comes,
they'll have us dialed in.

33:46.624 --> 33:48.659
And how would do
it, if you were them?

33:48.759 --> 33:49.927
What?

33:50.027 --> 33:53.497
How would you do
it, if you were them?

33:53.597 --> 33:54.365
How would I do it?

33:57.768 --> 34:00.104
Well, first I"d knock
out our mortar pit.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.039
Without that, we're fucked.

34:02.139 --> 34:04.074
Then I'd start hammering
our stand-to trucks,

34:04.174 --> 34:07.244
armored Humvees,
especially LRAS 2.

34:07.344 --> 34:09.079
That protects our mortars.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.449
Take out our ammo depot,
so we can't resupply.

34:13.817 --> 34:18.121
And then I'd hit our generator,
effectively kill our comms.

34:21.291 --> 34:24.362
And then I'd start sending
fighters on the switchbacks.

34:24.462 --> 34:27.664
It'd be a race to get inside
the wire before air support.

34:27.764 --> 34:30.134
Yeah, but even then it's
gonna take a few hours.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.268
The B1s come all the
way from fucking Qatar.

34:32.369 --> 34:34.472
Yeah, that's right, Carter.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.706
Yeah.

34:36.806 --> 34:41.779
I'd get inside our cab, take
our ECP, divide us in half.

34:41.879 --> 34:43.081
Pretty much then we're fucked.

34:45.748 --> 34:47.284
Goddamn it, Ro.

34:47.384 --> 34:48.753
Who the fuck pissed
in your Cheerios?

34:51.355 --> 34:53.090
Well, sorry, pal.

34:53.190 --> 34:55.960
But that's life at Camp Keating.

34:56.060 --> 34:59.996
Any thought how
we stop 'em, Sarge?

35:00.097 --> 35:01.499
We don't.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.835
[chuckling]

35:04.902 --> 35:06.069
[groaning]

35:06.169 --> 35:06.737
There you go.

35:06.838 --> 35:07.471
I'm good.

35:07.571 --> 35:08.706
Hey, guys.

35:08.806 --> 35:10.174
You think what fucking
happened to Captain Keating

35:10.274 --> 35:11.742
made it back to the
news in the States?

35:11.842 --> 35:13.977
The only news people give a
shit about back in the States

35:14.077 --> 35:15.346
is who's fucking Paris Hilton.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.481
Who the fuck hasn't?

35:17.581 --> 35:19.950
I saw her picture
getting out of the car.

35:20.050 --> 35:23.087
Goddamn it, even the fucking
hajis have seen her snatch.

35:23.187 --> 35:25.289
Yeah, One Night in
Paris, Taliban bestseller.

35:25.389 --> 35:28.058
Ah, there you go.

35:28.158 --> 35:29.527
Goddamn it.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.595
It's a good day when God
made my ass, right, Sergeant?

35:31.695 --> 35:32.162
Careful, Sergeant.

35:32.262 --> 35:33.564
You know what?

35:33.664 --> 35:34.798
Somebody's gotta be fit
around here for when we go

35:34.898 --> 35:36.000
hand-to-hand with these fucks.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.201
Know what I'm saying?

35:37.301 --> 35:38.202
[inaudible],, you
go mouth-to-mouth,

35:38.302 --> 35:39.436
this war would be over.

35:39.536 --> 35:41.438
I'll fuck you till
you love me, boy.

35:41.538 --> 35:44.107
You just keep working on
those man tits, Gallegos.

35:44.207 --> 35:45.542
They're intimidated by it.

35:45.643 --> 35:48.645
Somebody's gotta win
this fucking war, man.

35:48.745 --> 35:49.479
OK.

35:49.580 --> 35:50.681
Let's go.

35:50.781 --> 35:51.581
Let me spot you, boy.
[praying in the distance]

35:51.682 --> 35:52.249
Hey, Ro.

35:52.349 --> 35:53.183
Let's go, let's go.

35:53.283 --> 35:54.018
- Hey, Ro.
- Come on.

35:54.118 --> 35:54.685
What's going on?

36:04.094 --> 36:05.796
Hey, how's it going, man?

36:05.896 --> 36:06.463
How you doing?

36:06.564 --> 36:07.231
Come here.

36:07.331 --> 36:09.400
Come here, come here!

36:09.500 --> 36:11.836
Fuck!

36:11.936 --> 36:12.503
Shit.

36:15.305 --> 36:16.206
Warning shot!

36:16.307 --> 36:17.141
[gunshot]

36:17.241 --> 36:19.910
Fuck!

36:20.010 --> 36:20.844
Motherfucker.

36:20.944 --> 36:22.246
Jesus Christ!

36:22.346 --> 36:23.981
Watch where you're
going, you haji fuck!

36:24.081 --> 36:24.948
Motherfucker.

36:25.048 --> 36:26.117
I should fucking wax you.

36:26.217 --> 36:27.384
What the fuck, is he blind?

36:27.484 --> 36:28.652
What's going on, Sergeant?

36:28.752 --> 36:29.286
What's this?

36:29.386 --> 36:30.888
What's this, huh?

36:30.988 --> 36:31.655
What's this?

36:31.755 --> 36:32.689
What is this?

36:32.789 --> 36:34.392
He's taking photos
of our camp, sir.

36:34.492 --> 36:35.960
I'll fucking kill him.

36:36.060 --> 36:37.094
Fucker's taking photos.

36:37.194 --> 36:38.395
[speaking pashto]

36:38.495 --> 36:40.731
Must be to show the
enemy what we see here.

36:40.831 --> 36:41.432
[speaking pashto]

36:42.199 --> 36:43.601
Huh, what is this?

36:43.701 --> 36:44.134
[speaking pashto]

36:44.234 --> 36:46.003
What is this?

36:46.103 --> 36:47.171
Is this a gift?

36:47.271 --> 36:50.341
Is this a gift from the Taliban?

36:50.441 --> 36:51.809
So, do you want one?

36:54.912 --> 36:56.380
You're looking at my scars?

36:56.480 --> 36:58.682
Yeah, you'd be fucked up, too,
if you had a kid-beating dad

36:58.782 --> 36:59.816
like my old man.

36:59.916 --> 37:00.818
And he was a fucking cop.

37:04.555 --> 37:07.291
Americans can have
fucked up lives, too.

37:07.391 --> 37:10.861
Drunk a whole bottle
of carpet cleaner once.

37:10.961 --> 37:12.096
I puked that up.

37:12.196 --> 37:13.231
Couldn't go through with it.

37:16.233 --> 37:18.535
I did have a great mom, though.

37:18.635 --> 37:22.272
I should probably
call her, but--

37:22.372 --> 37:26.643
did-- did you ever see
your mom, because of the--

37:26.743 --> 37:28.545
Didn't sign up for
Jeopardy, Thomson.

37:28.646 --> 37:29.846
Shit me.

37:29.947 --> 37:31.081
Sergeant.

37:31.181 --> 37:33.984
It's called a fucking burka.

37:34.084 --> 37:34.719
A burka, yeah.

37:37.420 --> 37:40.691
Um, what did he do?

37:40.791 --> 37:42.726
Told us the elders
from Kamu paid

37:42.826 --> 37:45.830
him to take photos
of our camp, probably

37:45.930 --> 37:47.931
for the fucking Taliban.

37:48.031 --> 37:52.670
We'll call another shura, find
out what the fuck happened.

37:52.770 --> 37:55.306
It is important that we
find out which elders in Kamu

37:55.406 --> 37:56.240
paid Nasir.

37:56.340 --> 37:57.008
[speaking pashto]

38:00.644 --> 38:03.414
Good boy, good
boy, not bad boy.

38:03.514 --> 38:05.749
What he was doing
was a red flag for us.

38:05.850 --> 38:06.450
Red flag?

38:06.550 --> 38:07.618
A communist flag?

38:07.718 --> 38:08.185
A warning sign.

38:08.285 --> 38:09.019
Oh.

38:09.119 --> 38:10.021
[speaking pashto]

38:11.288 --> 38:13.123
It is important
that we investigate.

38:13.223 --> 38:13.858
[speaking pashto]

38:14.959 --> 38:15.926
Your son will not be hurt.

38:16.026 --> 38:16.627
[speaking pashto]

38:18.062 --> 38:19.697
If he is innocent, he'll
be back in two or three days.

38:19.797 --> 38:20.598
[speaking pashto]

38:27.872 --> 38:29.639
He says, you have broke
Commander Keating's promise.

38:29.739 --> 38:33.777
You haven't paid them, and now
you steal their children, too.

38:33.877 --> 38:34.411
This money?

38:34.511 --> 38:35.445
[speaking pashto]

38:35.545 --> 38:36.280
It's for building the school.

38:36.380 --> 38:36.981
[speaking pashto]

38:38.249 --> 38:40.050
For bringing
power and water to--

38:40.150 --> 38:40.918
what's that place called?

38:41.018 --> 38:42.019
Urmul, sir.

38:42.119 --> 38:43.053
Urmul.

38:43.153 --> 38:43.854
[speaking pashto]

38:44.922 --> 38:45.956
But now I have
to hold on to this.

38:46.056 --> 38:46.724
[speaking pashto]

38:47.457 --> 38:48.492
Until you help me.

38:48.592 --> 38:49.927
[speaking pashto]

38:51.628 --> 38:54.164
It is an honor to be
among such courageous men.

38:54.264 --> 38:55.533
[speaking pashto]

38:57.267 --> 38:58.302
Men who love peace.

38:58.402 --> 38:59.570
[speaking pashto]

39:00.637 --> 39:02.306
Men who want that
peace to spread.

39:02.406 --> 39:03.541
[speaking pashto]

39:04.508 --> 39:06.009
And the projects will spread.

39:06.109 --> 39:07.244
[speaking pashto]

39:07.344 --> 39:08.879
If we all work together.

39:08.979 --> 39:11.382
[speaking pashto]

39:11.482 --> 39:12.182
Inshallah.

39:12.282 --> 39:12.916
Inshallah.

39:13.016 --> 39:13.784
Inshallah.

39:13.884 --> 39:14.318
Inshallah.

39:14.418 --> 39:15.285
Inshallah.

39:15.385 --> 39:16.920
Inshallah.

39:17.020 --> 39:21.258
Half the Afghan men from
the last shura are gone.

39:21.358 --> 39:23.294
Yeah.

39:23.394 --> 39:26.463
The fighting age ones.

39:26.563 --> 39:28.198
Griffin, come here.

39:28.298 --> 39:28.866
Sure.

39:32.669 --> 39:33.937
You got a good handle
on this shit, right?

39:34.037 --> 39:36.440
I mean, you're Cherokee or
something, I don't know.

39:36.540 --> 39:37.207
You're a tribe.

39:37.307 --> 39:38.375
They're a tribe.

39:38.475 --> 39:41.645
It's Chippewa, sir.

39:41.745 --> 39:43.080
But, uh, you know,
I didn't grow up

39:43.180 --> 39:45.983
smoking a peace pipe around
the fire with my father

39:46.083 --> 39:48.452
and the tribal elders.

39:48.552 --> 39:52.823
But, uh, you know, I know
not to piss them off.

39:52.923 --> 39:54.658
I know that we get
shot at a lot less

39:54.758 --> 39:57.361
when the villagers are happy.

39:57.461 --> 40:00.330
That way we can
focus on the mission.

40:00.430 --> 40:01.565
You know what our mission is?

40:05.002 --> 40:06.270
Not really, sir.

40:06.370 --> 40:09.707
Well, we can't accomplish our
mission if we can't survive.

40:09.807 --> 40:11.609
The elders will come around.

40:11.709 --> 40:14.878
They need us as much
as we need them.

40:14.979 --> 40:15.713
Yes, sir.

40:18.648 --> 40:20.551
Hey, Larson,
you're SOG, right?

40:20.651 --> 40:21.485
Yeah, what's up, Sergeant?

40:21.585 --> 40:22.486
Muhammad, come here.

40:24.955 --> 40:26.323
Tell him exactly
what you told me.

40:26.423 --> 40:27.024
Salam alaykum, sir.

40:27.124 --> 40:28.225
Salam, bro.

40:28.325 --> 40:29.760
I've just been to
the village, sir.

40:29.860 --> 40:32.128
My sources are telling me the
Talibans are coming on us.

40:32.228 --> 40:33.297
OK.

40:33.397 --> 40:34.865
The villagers
are not happy, sir.

40:34.965 --> 40:37.667
They are complaining about their
money, the school, the road.

40:37.767 --> 40:39.269
The previous shura
didn't go well, sir.

40:39.369 --> 40:40.804
Everything-- and
I really believe,

40:40.904 --> 40:42.973
sir, this time my sources are
telling me that the Talibans

40:43.073 --> 40:43.807
are coming on us.

40:43.907 --> 40:45.275
How many are gonna come on us?

40:45.375 --> 40:46.142
A lot, sir.

40:46.242 --> 40:47.678
I don't know, a lot.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.813
You think like, um, in a
row, or at the same time, or--

40:49.913 --> 40:51.215
Sir, are you laughing at me?

40:51.315 --> 40:51.949
No, no.

40:52.049 --> 40:53.016
I'm sorry.

40:53.116 --> 40:54.885
Sir, do you know
what the problem is?

40:54.985 --> 40:57.454
The British invaded us, and
they didn't listen to us.

40:57.554 --> 40:58.555
They thought we were stupid.

40:58.655 --> 40:59.523
They were crushed down.

40:59.623 --> 41:00.490
All right.

41:00.590 --> 41:02.026
The Russians invaded us.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.093
They thought we were stupid,
and they were crushed down.

41:03.193 --> 41:04.361
Mohammed, Mohammed!

41:04.461 --> 41:05.862
And now you make
the same mistake, sir!

41:05.962 --> 41:07.398
Mohammed, we don't need a
fucking history lesson, OK?

41:07.498 --> 41:08.932
You know why we
don't listen to you?

41:09.032 --> 41:10.167
Why?

41:10.267 --> 41:11.768
Because every week, you
tell us the same damn thing!

41:11.869 --> 41:12.469
Because--

41:12.569 --> 41:13.770
You're always crying--

41:13.870 --> 41:16.573
you're always crying wolf.

41:16.673 --> 41:18.375
Of course, we-- we
have the Taliban

41:18.475 --> 41:19.743
surrounding us all the time.

41:19.843 --> 41:21.078
We're in the middle
of Afghanistan.

41:21.178 --> 41:22.479
We get hit every single day.

41:22.579 --> 41:24.014
You coming in and yelling
"the Taliban is coming,

41:24.114 --> 41:25.949
the Taliban is coming" is
just added pressure, man.

41:26.049 --> 41:28.084
I don't need to learn about
the fucking battle of Normandy

41:28.185 --> 41:29.386
from you.

41:29.486 --> 41:30.420
It's cool, man.

41:30.520 --> 41:31.722
We heard you.

41:31.822 --> 41:32.522
It's OK.

41:32.622 --> 41:34.091
Sir, thank you.

41:34.191 --> 41:35.392
I have a little family.

41:35.492 --> 41:36.292
I really don't want to die.

41:36.393 --> 41:37.527
We know.

41:37.627 --> 41:38.295
And I don't want
you to die as well.

41:38.395 --> 41:39.163
That's all, sir.

41:39.263 --> 41:40.064
Thank you.

41:40.164 --> 41:40.898
We won't let you down.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.199
I've done my job.

41:42.299 --> 41:43.467
Thank you, Mohammed.

41:43.567 --> 41:45.502
You're still my second
favorite Mohammed.

41:45.602 --> 41:47.738
Guy hates dick jokes.

41:47.838 --> 41:48.439
Yeah.

41:48.539 --> 41:50.006
Think he's you serious?

41:50.107 --> 41:51.608
I think he'll be
serious when he's the one

41:51.708 --> 41:53.877
that's running and hiding.

41:53.977 --> 41:54.545
Yeah.

41:59.649 --> 42:01.485
I wouldn't trade
this for anything.

42:01.585 --> 42:02.986
YLLESCAS: That right, private?

42:03.086 --> 42:05.456
You'd rather hump gear or
a couple of porn stars?

42:05.556 --> 42:06.690
I'd rather hump gear.

42:06.790 --> 42:07.791
Well, shit, Yunger.

42:07.891 --> 42:09.626
Thank you for your service.

42:09.726 --> 42:10.894
Thank you for your service!

42:10.994 --> 42:12.362
It's worth it for
the brotherhood, man.

42:12.462 --> 42:15.666
Look at us, band of brothers!

42:15.766 --> 42:17.701
Like me and Sergeant Martin.

42:17.801 --> 42:20.504
We can just say
anything to one another,

42:20.604 --> 42:22.272
and we're still tight
as fuck, man, always

42:22.372 --> 42:23.907
will be after this, right?

42:24.007 --> 42:26.843
Shit, he can call me a
white trash motherfucker,

42:26.943 --> 42:29.413
and I could call him a nigger,
and it doesn't even matter.

42:29.513 --> 42:30.547
Wait, what?

42:30.647 --> 42:32.116
What the fuck you
just say to me?

42:32.216 --> 42:33.450
You can call me what?

42:33.551 --> 42:34.651
Yo, Yunger, you about
to get your ass whooped.

42:34.751 --> 42:36.954
You Whiskey Tango
cousin fucker you.

42:37.054 --> 42:37.921
Chill, man.

42:38.021 --> 42:39.222
Go ahead, say that
shit again, man.

42:39.322 --> 42:40.657
I'll slap your fucking nose off.

42:40.757 --> 42:42.493
All right, knock it off!

42:42.593 --> 42:43.760
You got my blessing
to kick his Whiskey

42:43.860 --> 42:45.395
Tango ass when we get back.

42:45.495 --> 42:46.563
You're a dead man, Yunger.

42:46.663 --> 42:47.764
What are they saying?

42:47.864 --> 42:50.367
Can't even make
out this dialect.

42:50.467 --> 42:52.769
I think they're
talking about scarves.

42:52.869 --> 42:56.373
You don't-- you don't
speak the goddamn dialect?

42:56.473 --> 42:58.975
All right, secure
the far side.

42:59.075 --> 43:00.911
Sir, let us.

43:01.011 --> 43:02.179
Carter.

43:02.279 --> 43:04.147
Carter, come here.

43:04.247 --> 43:05.282
Kirk, you go.

43:05.382 --> 43:06.316
You got it.

43:06.416 --> 43:07.184
Yunger, on me.

43:09.686 --> 43:11.388
Welcome the Denny's.

43:11.488 --> 43:13.490
I'll be your server, Carter.

43:13.590 --> 43:15.525
Don't mind the Goth makeup.

43:15.625 --> 43:18.095
I just hate myself.

43:18.195 --> 43:20.331
[chuckling]

43:21.831 --> 43:26.403
Well, OK, rock star, I'll
have a grand slam, then.

43:26.503 --> 43:28.705
What?

43:28.805 --> 43:29.806
Carter, that was
pretty good, man.

43:29.906 --> 43:31.040
MAN: OK, good to go!

43:31.140 --> 43:32.175
No?

43:32.276 --> 43:34.911
Captain Yllescas, this
bridge is for shit, sir.

43:35.011 --> 43:36.980
Embrace the suck, Yunger.

43:37.080 --> 43:37.647
Yes.

43:37.748 --> 43:38.615
Yes, sir.

43:38.715 --> 43:39.749
I got a question.

43:39.849 --> 43:42.119
Your old man in the military?

43:42.219 --> 43:44.988
Yes, sir, West
Point, class of '84.

43:45.088 --> 43:45.455
Really?

43:45.555 --> 43:46.656
Yeah.

43:46.756 --> 43:49.626
You know a guy
named Nick Coddington?

43:49.726 --> 43:51.095
Yeah, I think
he did, actually.

43:51.195 --> 43:52.963
He's a fucking prick.

43:53.063 --> 43:54.865
[chuckling]

43:54.965 --> 43:56.332
You like football, sir?

43:56.432 --> 43:57.367
I do like football, yeah.

43:57.467 --> 43:58.601
Thanks for asking.

43:58.701 --> 43:59.536
Are you, uh-- you
a basket fan, right?

43:59.636 --> 44:00.570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:00.670 --> 44:01.538
Yeah, I think they're gonna--

44:01.638 --> 44:03.573
[explosion]

44:03.674 --> 44:05.909
[shouting]

44:06.009 --> 44:07.177
We got someone down there.

44:07.277 --> 44:09.480
Goddamn it, man, where's
that coming from?

44:09.580 --> 44:11.048
Get the fuck down now!

44:11.148 --> 44:13.417
Fuck!

44:13.517 --> 44:14.417
Goddamn it!

44:14.517 --> 44:15.652
Anyone got eyes?

44:15.752 --> 44:16.653
Thomson, call it in.

44:16.753 --> 44:18.756
I see movement, 11 o'clock.

44:18.856 --> 44:20.924
Norman, get your fucking
ass down there and grab him.

44:26.196 --> 44:27.664
Yunger.

44:27.764 --> 44:29.400
Hey, you OK?

44:42.779 --> 44:45.249
[playing guitar]

44:57.827 --> 45:01.331
(SINGING) Everybody dies.

45:04.434 --> 45:07.738
Did you take the lonely path?

45:07.838 --> 45:10.307
[chattering]

45:13.944 --> 45:20.150
Beneath the darkening sky,
we start to question why.

45:20.250 --> 45:21.985
[chattering]

45:26.323 --> 45:31.361
I think I had like a piece
of his brain in my mouth, man.

45:31.461 --> 45:32.396
Blew him right up.

45:32.496 --> 45:35.131
Oh, Yunger.

45:35.231 --> 45:36.733
Yunger, you OK?

45:36.833 --> 45:39.102
He just blew him up, Sergeant.

45:39.202 --> 45:40.336
Yeah.

45:40.436 --> 45:41.071
Yeah, I know.

45:41.171 --> 45:42.538
I was there.

45:42.638 --> 45:45.041
He just blew him up, man.

45:45.141 --> 45:49.613
I think I had like a piece
of his brain in my mouth.

45:49.713 --> 45:52.315
Yeah.

45:52.415 --> 45:53.617
Yeah, I know, man.

45:53.717 --> 45:56.119
That was-- it was bad.

45:56.219 --> 45:58.522
I'm a bad soldier, Sergeant.

45:58.622 --> 45:59.790
You know, my dad was right.

45:59.890 --> 46:00.557
I don't think I can--

46:00.657 --> 46:01.592
No, no, no, no.

46:01.692 --> 46:03.794
You're a good soldier.

46:03.894 --> 46:04.995
You're a good soldier, Yunger.
- Don't fucking bull--

46:05.095 --> 46:06.363
don't bullshit me, man.

46:06.463 --> 46:08.999
I'm not bullshitting you, OK?

46:09.099 --> 46:11.668
I feel so fucked
up, Sergeant, man.

46:11.768 --> 46:14.304
So-- I feel so fucked up.

46:14.404 --> 46:15.906
I know.

46:16.006 --> 46:18.542
I know what you're
going through, OK?

46:18.642 --> 46:21.310
The same thing
happened to me in Iraq.

46:21.411 --> 46:24.647
I watched my best friend
die, a fucking sniper.

46:24.747 --> 46:30.287
But, Yunger, Yunger,
you listen to me.

46:30.387 --> 46:32.755
I got a wife and
kids to come home to,

46:32.855 --> 46:35.859
and I made them promises.

46:35.959 --> 46:37.694
So I need you to make a choice.

46:37.794 --> 46:39.162
You gotta get your
shit together,

46:39.262 --> 46:41.197
or we're gonna get
you out of here.

46:41.298 --> 46:43.867
Sergeant.

46:43.967 --> 46:47.070
I'm fucking--
fucking trying, man.

46:47.170 --> 46:47.637
I just--

46:47.737 --> 46:48.738
Listen to me.

46:48.839 --> 46:49.406
Sergeant!

46:52.943 --> 46:53.844
Get him to the aid station.

46:53.944 --> 46:54.978
We're gonna medevac him out.

47:02.953 --> 47:04.021
All right, guys, let's go.

47:06.823 --> 47:09.159
Yunger, it's time to go.

47:09.259 --> 47:10.360
We'll see you in a few months.

47:15.765 --> 47:16.900
Don't let him touch the ground!

47:36.019 --> 47:37.354
HESCOS are pretty beat up.

47:37.454 --> 47:39.623
We got double-strand
Concertina wire and trip flares

47:39.723 --> 47:41.058
around the entire perimeter.

47:41.158 --> 47:42.692
We're thinking about making
it triple-strand, sir.

47:42.792 --> 47:44.227
And given all
the attacks here,

47:44.327 --> 47:46.529
sir, I really think we should
change our Claymore mines.

47:46.629 --> 47:48.598
As I understand it, they've
been out there for over a year,

47:48.698 --> 47:50.667
and are probably ineffective.
- We'll get into all that later.

47:50.767 --> 47:52.135
How many ANA here?

47:52.236 --> 47:54.404
Uh, 80 on the payroll,
when they all show up,

47:54.504 --> 47:55.505
which is never.

47:55.605 --> 47:58.108
We get 20 at a time, at best.

47:58.208 --> 47:59.742
Sort of what I thought.

47:59.842 --> 48:00.577
This the TOC?

48:00.677 --> 48:01.378
It is, sir.

48:06.649 --> 48:08.018
New orders have come down.

48:08.118 --> 48:10.587
We're closing this
outpost come July.

48:10.687 --> 48:11.821
July, sir?

48:11.922 --> 48:13.357
July 6th.

48:13.457 --> 48:15.792
That's where I want you to
concentrate all your efforts,

48:15.892 --> 48:17.193
closing shop.

48:17.294 --> 48:18.495
Yes, sir.

48:18.595 --> 48:19.729
Goodnight, gentlemen.

48:19.829 --> 48:21.531
I'll see you in the morning.

48:21.631 --> 48:22.365
Good night, sir.

48:22.465 --> 48:22.933
Good night, sir.

48:27.337 --> 48:29.873
July, huh?

48:29.973 --> 48:30.540
Good night.

48:48.858 --> 48:49.926
What is this?

48:50.026 --> 48:52.195
It's an Afghan
voter ID card, sir.

48:52.295 --> 48:53.764
It was at the bridge
where Captain Yllescas

48:53.864 --> 48:55.465
was targeted-- targeted.

48:55.565 --> 48:57.100
It most likely fell
out of the prick's

48:57.200 --> 48:59.002
pocket that killed our captain.

48:59.102 --> 49:01.605
Tell him, Malik.

49:01.705 --> 49:03.506
I'm afraid it's true, sir.

49:03.606 --> 49:05.408
I, uh, remember this man.

49:05.508 --> 49:09.912
He was one of the workers
at the hydroelectric plant.

49:10.013 --> 49:11.281
Somebody who we
were employing.

49:11.381 --> 49:13.316
We're not sure
which village he's in.

49:13.416 --> 49:15.652
But I can saddle up
the men, find him.

49:15.752 --> 49:17.287
Absolutely not.

49:17.387 --> 49:20.557
The squadron has appointed
an investigating officer.

49:20.657 --> 49:22.092
We will wait on him to get here.

49:22.192 --> 49:24.261
Sir, by the time he gets
here, that suspect will be gone.

49:24.361 --> 49:26.463
I am not gonna have
you guys antagonize

49:26.563 --> 49:29.566
the population by rousing
families in the villages.

49:29.666 --> 49:32.202
Colonel Spicer will have my ass.

49:32.302 --> 49:34.437
With all due respect,
Captain Broward,

49:34.537 --> 49:36.106
I think the Colonel
would appreciate it if--

49:36.206 --> 49:39.376
What the Colonel would
appreciate is, we do our jobs

49:39.476 --> 49:44.247
and properly, especially
since we outta here come July.

49:44.347 --> 49:45.515
The man killed our commander.

49:50.720 --> 49:52.955
I know.

49:53.055 --> 49:56.226
Justice will be
served, Sergeant.

49:56.326 --> 49:57.894
Let's get this to the
proper authorities.

49:57.994 --> 49:59.762
Sir.

49:59.862 --> 50:02.398
OK?

50:02.499 --> 50:03.633
OK, sir.

50:03.733 --> 50:04.301
Thank you.

50:07.804 --> 50:08.438
Private.

50:08.538 --> 50:09.739
Sir.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.641
Let's get this
to the burn pit.

50:11.742 --> 50:13.743
Yes, sir.

50:13.843 --> 50:14.411
Aw, man.

50:18.147 --> 50:18.815
Thank you, sir.

50:18.915 --> 50:19.582
There you go.

50:19.682 --> 50:20.816
Have fun dreams.

50:20.917 --> 50:21.985
Take this.

50:22.085 --> 50:22.986
I don't want anybody
getting malaria

50:23.086 --> 50:24.020
and spitting blood and shit.

50:24.120 --> 50:24.754
Hey, Scusa.

50:24.854 --> 50:25.855
I finished.

50:25.955 --> 50:27.023
I finished my application.

50:27.123 --> 50:28.424
Application for what?

50:28.524 --> 50:30.260
This guy wants
to be an officer.

50:30.360 --> 50:31.027
No, no.

50:31.127 --> 50:32.229
I wanna go to flight school.

50:32.329 --> 50:33.496
Flight school, Scusa?

50:33.596 --> 50:35.198
Shit, I wouldn't let
you hand out peanuts

50:35.298 --> 50:36.766
on the Afghan Air, my friend.

50:36.866 --> 50:37.733
Thanks, Kirk.

50:37.833 --> 50:38.534
That's really nice of you.

50:38.634 --> 50:39.169
Hey, hey, hey.

50:39.269 --> 50:40.570
Goodbye, ladies.

50:40.670 --> 50:43.106
You're gonna be a good
pilot and a good officer.

50:43.206 --> 50:44.407
Thanks, Sergeant.

50:44.507 --> 50:46.109
But I ain't calling
you "sir" ever.

50:46.209 --> 50:47.243
Hey, it's all good, Sergeant.

50:47.343 --> 50:49.812
You can call me
whatever you want.

50:49.912 --> 50:51.547
I'll think of something.

50:51.647 --> 50:53.984
I'm sure you will.

50:54.084 --> 50:54.885
Really?

50:54.985 --> 50:56.519
An officer and a pilot?

50:56.619 --> 50:57.387
Yeah.

50:57.487 --> 50:58.622
Good luck with those goggles.

51:02.225 --> 51:03.659
What's up, guys?

51:03.759 --> 51:04.527
Morning, Sergeant.

51:04.627 --> 51:06.629
Morning, Sergeant.

51:06.729 --> 51:07.663
How you hanging?

51:07.763 --> 51:08.932
Not too bad.

51:09.032 --> 51:10.834
Scusa stole my fucking
cheese tortellini.

51:10.934 --> 51:12.068
Now I got Asian beef strips.

51:12.168 --> 51:14.103
Hey, my one-year-old
loves 'em?

51:14.203 --> 51:14.805
Let me see those.

51:17.573 --> 51:19.843
I'll show you what you do
with this Asian beef dicks.

51:23.647 --> 51:24.213
Come here.

51:24.313 --> 51:25.782
Come here, Franklin.

51:25.882 --> 51:27.383
Come on, buddy.

51:27.484 --> 51:28.351
Hey, see?

51:28.451 --> 51:29.686
Even the dogs don't
eat this shit.

51:29.786 --> 51:30.986
Don't abuse my dog, Sergeant.

51:31.087 --> 51:31.988
[gunfire]

51:32.088 --> 51:32.889
Shit!

51:32.989 --> 51:33.656
Shit!

51:33.756 --> 51:34.257
Recon, Sergeant!

51:38.161 --> 51:38.728
Scusa!

51:38.828 --> 51:39.428
Yes.

51:39.529 --> 51:40.163
Pre-fire!

51:40.263 --> 51:43.066
Yes, Sergeant!

51:43.166 --> 51:46.936
Six, Red 2, taking sniper
fire at LRAS 2, over.

51:47.036 --> 51:48.605
We have movement at the treetop.

51:48.705 --> 51:51.908
Requesting fire
mission CRP Bravo 5.

51:52.008 --> 51:53.042
This is Six.

51:53.142 --> 51:55.945
Can you positively
identify target?

51:56.045 --> 51:58.314
We have movement
at the tree farm.

51:58.414 --> 52:00.383
Our mortars are laid on, sir.

52:00.483 --> 52:02.352
BROWARD: Do you have PID?

52:02.452 --> 52:05.054
Captain Broward, our
mortars are laid on.

52:05.154 --> 52:06.789
We have dudes who we're
getting sniped from.

52:06.889 --> 52:10.159
It's fucking obvious where
we're being shot from, over.

52:10.259 --> 52:11.928
Do you have PID?

52:12.028 --> 52:13.796
Do you see a weapon?

52:13.896 --> 52:15.999
Fucking PID.

52:16.099 --> 52:16.666
Scusa!

52:16.766 --> 52:17.233
Yeah.

52:17.333 --> 52:18.134
We have PID?

52:18.234 --> 52:21.137
Uh, I see--

52:21.237 --> 52:22.405
I see movement!

52:22.505 --> 52:23.673
Great.

52:23.773 --> 52:25.308
We have PID, sir.

52:25.408 --> 52:26.876
Clear to engage.

52:26.977 --> 52:28.211
Fuck you.

52:28.311 --> 52:29.479
Tree farm!

52:29.579 --> 52:31.748
Thomson, pack of
smokes says you miss!

52:31.848 --> 52:32.749
Now you know I love a smoke!

52:36.519 --> 52:38.721
Rules of engagement
are different here.

52:38.822 --> 52:41.991
You cannot shoot someone
for acting suspicious.

52:42.091 --> 52:43.626
Suspicious?

52:43.727 --> 52:48.331
So where were the
bullets coming from, sir?

52:48.431 --> 52:52.502
You must PID a weapon or
a radio in an enemy's hand.

52:52.602 --> 52:54.637
That comes straight
from McChrystal.

52:54.738 --> 52:57.941
You want your next tour
to be in Leavenworth?

52:58.041 --> 52:59.275
Well, someone
should tell McChrystal

52:59.376 --> 53:01.378
that we're not out here
selling Popsicles, sir.

53:04.547 --> 53:09.351
Excessive force alienates the
locals and causes greater risk.

53:09.452 --> 53:11.921
You better grass that
fucking sentiment now.

53:12.021 --> 53:15.325
Furthermore, who knows
when we'll be resupplied?

53:15.425 --> 53:18.461
And we can't waste ammo.

53:18.561 --> 53:21.364
And one more thing, Sergeant.

53:21.464 --> 53:23.933
You ever speak to
me like that again,

53:24.033 --> 53:25.902
I'll send you to squadron.

53:26.002 --> 53:29.171
You wanna be a staff
bitch and leave your men?

53:29.272 --> 53:29.839
No, sir.

53:34.511 --> 53:36.980
President Karzai doesn't
want American forces to leave

53:37.080 --> 53:39.215
before the Afghan election.

53:39.315 --> 53:42.084
General McChrystal agrees.

53:42.184 --> 53:43.786
You need to let the men know.

53:43.886 --> 53:46.188
So we're not closing
the outpost in July?

53:46.288 --> 53:47.190
That's correct.

53:47.290 --> 53:47.924
Got it.

53:48.024 --> 53:48.991
I'm sorry.

53:49.091 --> 53:51.160
Maybe October.

53:51.260 --> 53:52.762
The good news is,
you'll all receive

53:52.862 --> 53:56.566
an extra $1,000 a month.

53:56.666 --> 53:59.335
That's all.

53:59.435 --> 54:00.636
Thanks, Bundy.

54:00.737 --> 54:02.204
Let's go.

54:02.304 --> 54:03.540
Afternoon, sir.

54:03.640 --> 54:05.207
Sir.

54:05.308 --> 54:06.909
Let's get these
to the burn pit.

54:07.009 --> 54:08.177
Where do you want these?

54:08.277 --> 54:09.512
Set them right
there on the desk.

54:16.419 --> 54:17.554
Let's get them to the burn pit.

54:21.424 --> 54:23.326
You got it, sir.

54:26.062 --> 54:28.465
Fucking unbelievable.

54:28.565 --> 54:30.934
You got another
picture from home, I see.

54:31.034 --> 54:32.301
Yeah, check out these.

54:32.401 --> 54:34.203
You are a man
obsessed, I swear.

54:34.303 --> 54:35.604
Who wouldn't be?

54:35.705 --> 54:37.540
You are a lucky
guy, but I don't

54:37.640 --> 54:40.110
know if it's healthy
to, uh, dwell on her out

54:40.210 --> 54:42.946
here, at least on guard
and all, you know?

54:43.046 --> 54:44.514
Yeah, I know, I just--

54:44.614 --> 54:46.882
I keep thinking about where
the big one's gonna come from.

54:46.982 --> 54:48.918
Hey, fuck it.

54:49.018 --> 54:49.853
If they come, they come.

54:49.953 --> 54:51.020
This is our reality now.

54:51.120 --> 54:51.754
I know, I know.

54:51.854 --> 54:52.222
OK?

54:52.322 --> 54:54.490
Focus.

54:54.591 --> 54:55.925
Only thing that keeps
running through my head

54:56.025 --> 54:58.461
is how ungrateful I
was when I was at home.

54:58.561 --> 55:00.730
Look, man, we're
gonna get out of here

55:00.830 --> 55:02.966
and see our friends,
our families,

55:03.066 --> 55:04.667
our loved ones, Sophie.

55:04.767 --> 55:06.536
We're gonna have a chance
to make things right.

55:06.636 --> 55:07.002
Yeah.

55:07.102 --> 55:07.937
OK?

55:08.037 --> 55:09.171
Yeah.

55:09.271 --> 55:09.839
That's where I need
you at right now.

55:09.939 --> 55:11.741
OK, OK.

55:11.841 --> 55:14.343
Hey, you know what I'm gonna
do when I get back home?

55:14.444 --> 55:15.577
Tell me.

55:15.678 --> 55:16.913
I'm gonna take
her in her room.

55:17.013 --> 55:17.814
Yeah.

55:17.914 --> 55:18.214
Yeah, gonna hug her.

55:18.314 --> 55:18.948
Mm-hm.

55:19.048 --> 55:19.816
Gonna hold her.

55:19.916 --> 55:20.650
Mm-hm.

55:20.750 --> 55:21.751
And let her kiss me all over.

55:21.851 --> 55:22.519
Yeah.

55:22.619 --> 55:23.920
Never gonna let her go.

55:24.020 --> 55:25.255
Yeah, that's one lucky girl.

55:25.355 --> 55:26.388
Mm-hm.

55:26.488 --> 55:27.924
Belly rubs for days.

55:28.024 --> 55:28.591
Yeah.

55:59.355 --> 56:00.256
Sir.

56:00.356 --> 56:02.191
What's up, Carter?

56:02.291 --> 56:05.028
Can I speak to you under the
commander's open door policy?

56:05.128 --> 56:05.995
yeah, What's going on?

56:13.369 --> 56:16.739
Everyone's worried
about the new CO.

56:16.839 --> 56:19.341
OK, how so?

56:19.442 --> 56:20.443
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

56:20.543 --> 56:21.210
He's scared.

56:21.310 --> 56:22.544
It's obvious.

56:22.645 --> 56:24.413
He doesn't leave the TOC
except to take a shit.

56:24.513 --> 56:25.781
Even then, he does
it with an escort.

56:25.881 --> 56:29.419
I carry his piss every
other day to the burn pit.

56:29.519 --> 56:33.423
The men call him
Broward the Coward.

56:33.523 --> 56:36.158
Carter, take a seat.

56:36.258 --> 56:36.893
Take a seat, Carter.

56:36.993 --> 56:37.560
Come on.

56:41.164 --> 56:46.201
You ever heard of, uh, Captain
Bostick or Colonel Fenty?

56:46.302 --> 56:48.270
No, sir.

56:48.370 --> 56:49.806
They're two
commanders who lost

56:49.906 --> 56:52.708
their lives in this shithole
before Keating and Yllescas.

56:52.808 --> 56:53.776
OK.

56:53.876 --> 56:55.678
This commander is a
37-year-old captain,

56:55.778 --> 56:56.746
who has seen a
whole lot of death

56:56.846 --> 56:58.614
in Iraq before he got here.

56:58.714 --> 57:00.483
And he's probably
seen more firefights

57:00.583 --> 57:03.453
than you've seen in the movies.

57:03.553 --> 57:05.788
And despite all that, despite
the shitty odds stacked

57:05.888 --> 57:09.325
against him, he's here, anyway.

57:09.425 --> 57:11.795
People much smarter than you or
I put him here, and that's it.

57:15.164 --> 57:17.634
We will all do as he
fucking says, Carter.

57:20.370 --> 57:20.937
Yes, sir.

57:23.740 --> 57:27.643
And, Carter, I
better never, ever,

57:27.744 --> 57:30.412
ever hear that fucking
nickname again, from you

57:30.512 --> 57:32.882
or anybody else.

57:32.982 --> 57:35.784
Good to go?

57:35.885 --> 57:36.453
Yes, sir.

57:39.255 --> 57:39.823
Thank you.

57:55.471 --> 57:56.840
GALLEGOS (ON RADIO):
You awake, Carter?

58:01.911 --> 58:05.080
Yeah, I'm awake, Sergeant.

58:05.180 --> 58:06.516
GALLEGOS (ON RADIO): Good.

58:06.616 --> 58:08.051
'Cause I don't exactly feel
like lugging my ass out

58:08.151 --> 58:11.087
there to check on you.

58:11.187 --> 58:15.825
Well, all-- all good out here.

58:15.925 --> 58:17.560
GALLEGOS (ON RADIO): Just
because I'm not watching

58:17.660 --> 58:18.695
doesn't mean God isn't.

58:23.165 --> 58:27.203
You know, Jesus was
a pacifist, Sergeant.

58:27.303 --> 58:31.473
I joined--
volunteered for a war.

58:31.573 --> 58:33.342
You understand?

58:33.442 --> 58:34.977
I think that, uh--

58:35.077 --> 58:39.882
I think that tells you
where-- where God and I stand.

58:39.983 --> 58:42.151
GALLEGOS (ON RADIO): You
read the Bible, Carter?

58:42.251 --> 58:43.786
Violent as hell.

58:43.886 --> 58:46.956
Full of stories about
Christians using force for good.

58:47.056 --> 58:48.257
Yeah, I've read it.

58:48.357 --> 58:51.594
Muslims think they're good,
using force for good, too.

58:51.694 --> 58:53.530
GALLEGOS (ON RADIO): Well,
we can't both be right.

58:56.799 --> 58:58.101
We can both be wrong.

59:00.970 --> 59:03.305
GALLEGOS (ON RADIO):
Keep your ass awake.

59:03.405 --> 59:05.274
Out.

59:05.374 --> 59:06.242
Yeah, fuck you.

59:14.016 --> 59:16.619
I see movement, but
I don't see a weapon.

59:16.719 --> 59:17.687
Maybe it's a spotter.

59:21.090 --> 59:22.224
[explosion]

59:22.324 --> 59:22.892
Shit, shit, shit!

59:26.261 --> 59:28.164
Well, that one was closer!

59:28.264 --> 59:30.366
Yeah, 150 meters.

59:30.466 --> 59:32.067
They're walking them in.

59:32.167 --> 59:34.536
I can't believe these
fuckers have mortars now.

59:34.636 --> 59:35.571
Son of a bitch!

59:35.671 --> 59:36.506
BROWARD (ON RADIO): Shots fired.

59:36.606 --> 59:39.909
Yankee, Foxtrot, 15627.

59:40.009 --> 59:42.578
Sir, those grid coordinates
are 40 miles away.

59:42.678 --> 59:44.013
You mean Yankee, Echo?

59:44.113 --> 59:45.247
Yeah, shit.

59:45.347 --> 59:46.181
Yankee, Echo.

59:46.281 --> 59:47.616
Now he's fucking spooked.

59:47.716 --> 59:50.252
He's calling the wrong
fucking coordinates!

59:50.353 --> 59:54.890
15627890.

59:54.990 --> 59:58.361
Let's get some Willie
Pete on their asses.

59:58.461 --> 01:00:00.897
[explosion]

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:04.933
They were walking
mortars in and at night.

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.936
Which means they have
night vision now, sir.

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:08.403
BROWARD: Has this
ever happened before?

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:09.672
No, sir.

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:10.573
BROWARD: Well, where'd
they get 'em from?

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:11.907
Fucking ANA?

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:13.609
I don't know, but we'll
get accountability, sir.

01:00:13.709 --> 01:00:14.510
Captain Broward.

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:15.811
Captain.

01:00:15.911 --> 01:00:18.114
OK, make sure that happens.

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:18.815
You got it, sir.

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:20.115
What is it, Specialist?

01:00:20.215 --> 01:00:22.485
There's a situation
at the ANA gate, sir.

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:23.619
What's the situation?

01:00:23.719 --> 01:00:27.023
There's elders
from the village.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:27.724
Fuck.

01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:32.895
[barking]

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:37.233
You killed his daughter,
Captain, with white phosphorous

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:38.801
in the mortar attack last night.

01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:39.935
If his daughter
is dead, then you

01:00:40.035 --> 01:00:42.471
have my sincerest condolences.

01:00:42.571 --> 01:00:43.906
No "if," sir.

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:50.412
Sir, this isn't job, This
girl's been dead for days.

01:00:50.512 --> 01:00:51.714
This is what Americans bring.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:52.682
This is the death you bring.

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:53.983
No, this is Taliban.

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:55.384
This isn't us.

01:00:55.484 --> 01:00:57.053
The American government will
pay a condolence fee of 3,500

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:57.819
once--

01:00:57.919 --> 01:00:59.255
Sir, permission to speak.

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:00.256
Speak, Sergeant.

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:01.423
They killed this girl, sir.

01:01:01.523 --> 01:01:03.493
Another fucking cashing in, sir.

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:04.760
I understand, Sergeant.

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:06.695
Let me handle this.

01:01:06.795 --> 01:01:09.298
Everybody knows
you are leaving soon.

01:01:09.398 --> 01:01:12.701
If we do not get paid now,
we will never get paid.

01:01:12.801 --> 01:01:14.103
Why do you say, we're leaving?

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:14.937
We're not leaving.

01:01:15.037 --> 01:01:15.704
Why does he say we're leaving?

01:01:15.804 --> 01:01:16.605
No idea, sir.

01:01:16.705 --> 01:01:18.541
[screaming]

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:21.444
[speaking pashto]

01:01:25.781 --> 01:01:27.283
He claims the
dog bit him, sir.

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:28.351
Get this man to our medic.

01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:29.251
We'll take care of him.

01:01:29.351 --> 01:01:30.419
It's not so simple.

01:01:30.519 --> 01:01:31.821
To be bitten by a
dog is extremely

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:33.256
shameful in our culture.

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:34.490
They expect retribution.

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.159
[speaking pashto]

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.460
They want retribution, sir.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.964
This is fucking bullshit.

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:43.299
[gunshot]

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:44.266
Fuck!

01:01:44.366 --> 01:01:46.969
What the fuck?

01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:48.370
It'd be great if we
could all hang out,

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:51.740
just playing with dogs,
Witness Specialist Scusa,

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.575
but we're soldiers
in Afghanistan.

01:01:53.675 --> 01:01:55.278
We're not in a fucking dog park.

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:03.752
Pay this man from the
commander's discretionary fund.

01:02:03.852 --> 01:02:05.254
[speaking pashto]

01:02:14.463 --> 01:02:22.004
1,000, 2,000, 3,000,
4,000, 5,000, 6,000!

01:02:22.104 --> 01:02:23.472
I don't care what
anyone fucking says,

01:02:23.572 --> 01:02:25.240
man, that shit's torture.

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:26.809
[laughter]

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:27.776
Fuck that.

01:02:27.876 --> 01:02:29.912
Broward should have a go.

01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:32.714
I lasted 10 seconds.

01:02:32.814 --> 01:02:33.416
A year ago in Iraq.

01:02:38.687 --> 01:02:40.355
Boosting morale?

01:02:40.455 --> 01:02:41.057
Trying, sir.

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:49.131
I've been relieved
of duty, gentlemen.

01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:51.067
A bird's gonna get me out
of here in a day or two.

01:02:53.368 --> 01:02:56.138
Captain Stoney Portis is gonna
take over in a couple of weeks.

01:02:56.238 --> 01:02:59.107
And the sorties to close down
Combat Outpost Keating October

01:02:59.207 --> 01:02:59.776
6th.

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:05.748
You're in charge until
then, Lieutenant.

01:03:05.848 --> 01:03:06.415
Sir.

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:13.189
Gentlemen.

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:13.990
Sir.

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:15.224
Sir.

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:16.158
Sir.

01:03:16.258 --> 01:03:16.859
Sir.

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.127
[whistling]

01:03:18.227 --> 01:03:19.728
Stoney Portis is bad ass, man.

01:03:19.828 --> 01:03:20.763
Dude's legit.

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:21.998
Didn't you fuckers hear him?

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:22.631
What?

01:03:22.731 --> 01:03:24.199
We're going home.

01:03:24.299 --> 01:03:25.701
Just when I was starting to
have some fucking fun, right?

01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:27.236
I mean, we've heard
this shit before, right.

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:28.937
Yeah, they wouldn't have
scheduled the birds, man, if--

01:03:29.037 --> 01:03:31.107
if it wasn't happening for real.

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:31.907
He's right.

01:03:32.007 --> 01:03:33.776
It's a good point.

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:36.578
The Taliban cannot
fucking find out about this.

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:37.847
All right?

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:39.048
None of this gets
talked about in Skype,

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:41.283
radio, emails, nothing.

01:03:41.383 --> 01:03:41.751
Check?

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:43.019
Check.

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:44.186
They ain't getting
the drop on us, LT.

01:03:44.286 --> 01:03:45.454
Because, guys,
our mission from now

01:03:45.554 --> 01:03:47.356
on is what it's always been.

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:48.157
Yeah.

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:48.825
To survive.

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:55.898
Hey, hey, can you hear me?

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:57.300
You think I don't like being--

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.133
being there with him?

01:03:58.233 --> 01:04:00.570
He-- he's growing up without me.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:04.607
Just-- you know
this is how it goes.

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:07.342
Remember, it's all good.

01:04:07.442 --> 01:04:09.445
You know I love you.

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:12.715
If it's getting that bad
for you, I'll get out, OK?

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:16.018
I'll finish this deployment,
and-- and we'll start a family.

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:17.786
I gotta go now, baby.

01:04:17.886 --> 01:04:19.255
I love you.

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:22.057
All right, keep me
in your prayers, OK?

01:04:22.157 --> 01:04:24.693
And tell Dad to stop
being a wise ass.

01:04:24.793 --> 01:04:26.195
OK, God bless, mama.

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:29.231
Love to you and Dad, all right?

01:04:29.331 --> 01:04:31.334
I poured the whole
thing on his head.

01:04:34.436 --> 01:04:36.171
Yeah, I know.

01:04:36.271 --> 01:04:37.673
Oh, yeah, no, it was fine.

01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:39.975
He didn't really--
all right, uh, I--

01:04:40.075 --> 01:04:42.945
I gotta go, Mom.

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:45.580
I love you, too.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.049
Brittany, is that my son?

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:49.351
Put him on the phone.

01:04:49.451 --> 01:04:50.586
Hazim, hey, man!

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:57.460
I'm just working
on my fucking tan.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.395
I'm not fucking cussing.

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:02.464
I love you, blue eyes.

01:05:02.564 --> 01:05:03.833
Bye.

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:07.536
Yeah, yeah, eating enough.

01:05:07.636 --> 01:05:09.572
Love you, Gram-gram.

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:11.740
Trust me, babe, I quit.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.677
I wouldn't touch those things.

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.378
Uh, me too.

01:05:16.478 --> 01:05:18.614
Me too.

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:21.083
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:25.288
I put that fish
right back again.

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:28.124
I have to go sweetheart,
and you have to get to bed.

01:05:31.059 --> 01:05:31.661
Aw, fuck it.

01:05:34.496 --> 01:05:38.234
OK, on-- on the news, when
you watch the news on TV,

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:41.002
you see bad guys doing
bad things to good

01:05:41.102 --> 01:05:42.471
people like you and mommy?

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:47.142
It's my job to take care of
the bad guys, to find them

01:05:47.242 --> 01:05:48.377
and to kill them, sweetie.

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:05.428
OK, Miller, go
get some sleep, man.

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:17.072
Hey, Gallegos.

01:06:17.172 --> 01:06:20.942
Walked around this whole
base like a half hour ago.

01:06:21.042 --> 01:06:23.312
Fresh batteries.

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:25.447
Everyone's fucking good, man.

01:06:25.547 --> 01:06:27.249
Get some rack, man.

who would it be?

01:06:43.131 --> 01:06:45.100
No gun necessary.

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:15.416
You got him, got him?

01:14:15.516 --> 01:14:16.918
Come on, goddamn it!

01:14:17.018 --> 01:14:17.885
We got you.

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:18.687
Come on!

01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:20.154
You're gonna be all right.

01:14:20.254 --> 01:14:21.256
Oh, fuck, what the fuck?

01:14:21.356 --> 01:14:22.357
Fuck!

01:14:22.457 --> 01:14:24.125
Hey, shut your fucking mouth!

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:25.360
Get down!

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:26.528
We need to figure
out who needs what.

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:30.131
Everyone needs
fucking everything.

01:14:30.231 --> 01:14:31.566
Griffin, the Shura building.

01:14:31.666 --> 01:14:33.802
Shura building, check.

01:14:33.902 --> 01:14:36.004
LRAS 1, check.

01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:39.040
Scusa, get this to
Gallegos at LRAS 2.

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.108
[explosion]

01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:41.075
OK?

01:14:41.175 --> 01:14:42.010
It's all good, Sergeant.

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.778
All right.

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:43.244
All right.

01:14:43.344 --> 01:14:44.312
Go.

01:14:44.412 --> 01:14:46.214
Yes, Sergeant!

01:14:46.314 --> 01:14:47.548
Fuck.

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:50.284
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:52.887
[gunfire]

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:55.257
[groaning]

01:14:57.359 --> 01:14:59.261
It's all right, Scusa.

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:00.629
Fuck!

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:01.830
We're coming, Scusa.

01:15:09.037 --> 01:15:10.772
I got this.

01:15:10.872 --> 01:15:12.073
Come on.

01:15:12.173 --> 01:15:13.809
Scusa, let's go!

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:14.575
Go, go, go.

01:15:14.675 --> 01:15:15.610
We're coming in to medic.

01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:16.611
All right, stay with me, Kirk.

01:15:16.711 --> 01:15:17.612
Come on, buddy.

01:15:17.712 --> 01:15:18.379
Doc, where do you want him?

01:15:18.479 --> 01:15:19.648
Scusa's hit.

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:20.515
Get out of the way,
get out of the way.

01:15:20.615 --> 01:15:21.849
Scusa's fucking hit.

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:23.184
All right, stay with me, Kirk.
Stay with me.

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:24.152
Talk to me, guys, talks to me.
What happened?

01:15:24.252 --> 01:15:25.186
I'm not sure.

01:15:25.286 --> 01:15:26.421
I think he got hit in the neck.

01:15:26.521 --> 01:15:27.623
How's Kirk doing?

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:29.024
I got a pulse,
sir, but it's weak.

01:15:29.124 --> 01:15:30.459
It's really weak.

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:31.527
What have you got, man?

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:34.463
He's gone.

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:35.330
What?

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:36.431
No.
- He's gone.

01:15:36.531 --> 01:15:37.866
Put him in my room.
He's gone.

01:15:37.966 --> 01:15:38.700
- I sent him out there, man.
- Just get out of here.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.169
You're in the way.

01:15:41.269 --> 01:15:41.936
Holy shit.

01:15:42.036 --> 01:15:43.271
Is that Kirk?

01:15:43.371 --> 01:15:44.273
Fuck this hell, man.

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:49.043
We gotta help Gallegos.

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:51.012
Generator.

01:15:51.113 --> 01:15:53.381
[gunfire]

01:15:53.481 --> 01:15:54.616
Understood, sir.

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:55.784
Sir.
- SOG.

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:56.785
Sir.

01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:58.686
Apaches are wheels
up in 40 minutes.

01:15:58.787 --> 01:16:00.021
If we don't get
these guys ammo,

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:01.522
we're not gonna be here
in 40 fucking minutes.

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:04.059
[gunfire]

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:09.197
[explosion]

01:16:09.298 --> 01:16:09.865
Ah, shit!

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:11.600
Fuck!

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.035
Fucking gun's down, man.

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:14.269
Larson talk to me, man.

01:16:14.369 --> 01:16:15.503
The 50 cal's broken!

01:16:15.603 --> 01:16:16.538
Larson, talk to me.

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:17.639
They fucking blew it up, man!

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.007
Oh, for fuck-- goddamn it!

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:19.808
This is LRAS 2.

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:21.143
Where the fuck is our ammo?

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.643
MAN (ON RADIO): Moving
as fast as we can.

01:16:22.743 --> 01:16:24.112
We don't fucking
need the ammo, man.

01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:25.413
The fucking gun is down.

01:16:25.513 --> 01:16:27.048
Ammo, Larson.

01:16:27.148 --> 01:16:27.982
Goddamn it!

01:16:28.082 --> 01:16:29.651
What the fuck
is going on, man?

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:31.286
We need more ammo
at LRAS 2, ASAP.

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:37.859
I'm good.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.162
[gunfire]

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:40.829
Fuck!

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:33.848
[gunfire]

01:17:33.948 --> 01:17:35.183
Open the fucking door, Mace.

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:36.651
Get it open.

01:17:36.751 --> 01:17:37.986
Get the fuck in here, bro.

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:39.187
I have the 240.

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:40.589
240's fucking down, bro.

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:43.291
Get the fuck in here
or get the fuck out!

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:44.358
Ammo's--

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:45.460
Close the door,
close the door!

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.828
I'm trying!

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:48.363
What else you got?

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:50.698
I got-- here you go.

01:17:50.798 --> 01:17:52.233
Let him in, Carter.

01:17:52.333 --> 01:17:53.135
Who's that?

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:53.769
Oh, shit, I need ammo!

01:17:56.437 --> 01:17:57.405
Come on, get in.

01:17:57.505 --> 01:17:58.673
Get in, get in!

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:00.208
Hurry up!

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:02.109
Let him in here!

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:03.578
Oh, fuck!

01:18:03.678 --> 01:18:05.146
Nice of you to join
the party, Martin.

01:18:05.246 --> 01:18:05.847
You must like this.

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:06.647
It's like Cinco de Mayo.

01:18:06.748 --> 01:18:07.382
Oh, shit!

01:18:07.482 --> 01:18:09.851
[explosion]

01:18:11.686 --> 01:18:13.521
[explosion]

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:14.789
Oh, fuck!

01:18:14.889 --> 01:18:16.257
Gallegos, how you
holding up over there?

01:18:16.357 --> 01:18:17.425
Ro?

01:18:17.525 --> 01:18:18.960
I don't know, man.

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.728
We got a shitload of gunfire
from the fucking south, man.

01:18:20.828 --> 01:18:22.798
Well, other than that,
you're fine, right?

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:24.032
GALLEGOS (ON RADIO):
Yeah, I guess.

01:18:24.132 --> 01:18:27.002
Look, I got a
machine gun set up.

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.803
You think you guys can make
it back to the barracks?

01:18:28.903 --> 01:18:31.139
I don't know if you can
lay down enough fucking fire,

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:32.173
but go for it.

01:18:32.273 --> 01:18:32.707
Over.

01:18:32.807 --> 01:18:33.708
All right.

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:35.076
Be ready.

01:18:35.176 --> 01:18:36.210
Gregory, ready?

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:37.012
GREGORY: Good to go!

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:38.546
Good.

[gunfire]

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:55.396

[gunfire]

01:18:58.065 --> 01:18:59.768

01:19:07.208 --> 01:19:08.276
You OK

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:09.945
Yeah.

01:19:10.045 --> 01:19:11.580
Are you?

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.715
Holy fuck, your arm!

01:19:13.815 --> 01:19:15.951
Are you all right?

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:16.717
Yeah.

01:19:16.817 --> 01:19:17.485
Displace to the trenches.

01:19:17.585 --> 01:19:18.486
Are you sure?

01:19:18.586 --> 01:19:21.422
Go, go on, get out of here!

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:23.892
[coughing]

01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:28.596
Hey, brother.

01:19:28.696 --> 01:19:30.264
I'm sorry, I can't stay here.

01:19:30.364 --> 01:19:31.833
They're all over us.

01:19:31.933 --> 01:19:35.536
Thanks for trying, Ro.

01:19:35.636 --> 01:19:37.439
We'll just chill
here for a while.

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:38.673
Hey, Ro.

01:19:38.773 --> 01:19:40.375
Keep everyone the
fuck away from here.

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:42.309
Fuck!

01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:44.846
[gunfire]

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:47.983
Gregory.

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:48.616
Yeah.

01:19:48.716 --> 01:19:49.317
You all right?

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:49.985
Yeah.

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:54.222
The only way we're getting
those guys out there--

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:55.156
hey, Ro.

01:19:55.256 --> 01:19:56.525
We're gonna lose
another vehicle.

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:57.425
- Ro, hear me out here, man.
- What?

01:19:57.525 --> 01:19:58.292
LRAS 2 is stranded, OK?

01:19:58.392 --> 01:19:59.627
They are inoperable.

01:19:59.727 --> 01:20:00.962
I'm taking Truck 1.

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:01.829
I'm going with Faulkner.

01:20:01.929 --> 01:20:03.031
I'm going, too.

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:03.798
We're gonna get
those guys out of here.

01:20:03.898 --> 01:20:05.132
Yo, yo, yo, Ro.

01:20:05.233 --> 01:20:06.000
Listen, we gotta get
this arm checked out.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:06.901
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:20:07.001 --> 01:20:07.768
I just came from there.

01:20:07.868 --> 01:20:08.770
It's a cluster fuck.

01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:10.138
What, you wanna bleed out?

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:11.539
Listen, Gallegos is
telling everybody to stay

01:20:11.639 --> 01:20:12.640
back for a fucking reason.

01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:13.874
Fuck that, man.

01:20:13.974 --> 01:20:14.942
Dead bodies attract
more dead bodies.

01:20:15.042 --> 01:20:17.178
We have two KIAs already, OK?

01:20:17.278 --> 01:20:19.180
And we got Kirk in the
fucking aid station, man.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.515
Kirk's in the
fucking aid station.

01:20:20.615 --> 01:20:21.549
Kirk?

01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:24.786
Yeah, fucking Kirk, Sergeant.

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:28.723
OK, OK.

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:30.057
Check this.

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:32.560
You do this, you
do it smart, OK?

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:33.761
Fine.

01:20:33.861 --> 01:20:34.863
Use that maintenance
shed for cover.

01:20:34.963 --> 01:20:36.131
You don't go up the middle.

01:20:36.231 --> 01:20:38.433
No, that's too far
out of the way, man.

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:41.302
Don't rush for failure.

01:20:41.402 --> 01:20:42.337
Fine, OK, come on.

01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:44.773
Let's go, Griffin.

01:20:44.873 --> 01:20:46.074
Don't worry about that.

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:48.109
Just set it, set it,
splint it, move on, OK?

01:20:58.919 --> 01:21:00.888
I tried everything, man.

01:21:00.988 --> 01:21:02.690
MAN (ON RADIO): Six,
this is LRAS 1, I got

01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:03.959
a fucking sniper over here.

01:21:06.894 --> 01:21:10.031
I need your sniper rifle!

01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:12.199
Where's that ammo?

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:14.569
[gunfire]

01:21:17.638 --> 01:21:19.507
Koppes, you OK?

01:21:19.607 --> 01:21:20.841
Where's that sniper?

01:21:20.941 --> 01:21:22.076
He's behind me.

01:21:22.176 --> 01:21:23.511
Same guy who killed Scusa.

01:21:23.611 --> 01:21:24.512
Fuck.

01:21:24.612 --> 01:21:25.513
MAN: Allahu akbar!

01:21:25.613 --> 01:21:26.914
Shit.

01:21:41.462 --> 01:21:44.265
Man, come here.

01:21:44.365 --> 01:21:44.933

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:55.776
[gunfire]

01:21:55.876 --> 01:21:57.411
Keep doing what you're doing.

01:21:57.511 --> 01:21:58.646
I'm up the ECP.

01:21:58.746 --> 01:22:00.114
KOPPES: I got you.

01:22:00.214 --> 01:22:02.050
Sir, I hear them fucking
laughing, right outside--

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:04.586
Hey, hey, Claymores.

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:05.287
Roger.

01:22:08.856 --> 01:22:10.825
Fucking Claymores
aren't working.

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:12.193
Goddamned fucking Broward.

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:13.594
Hey, hey.

01:22:13.694 --> 01:22:16.297
We may die today, but let's kill
as many of these motherfuckers

01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:17.532
as we can.

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:18.733
Roger that.

01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:20.869
Frag these dudes,
frag these dudes.

01:22:20.969 --> 01:22:21.770
Roger.

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:24.572
Smoke 'em for three.

01:22:24.672 --> 01:22:27.475
one 1,000, two 1,000, three.

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:29.477

01:22:42.857 --> 01:22:45.126
[explosion]

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:47.495
Friendlies Friendlies!

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:49.264
Friendlies, hold!

01:22:49.364 --> 01:22:51.599
[explosion]

01:22:51.699 --> 01:22:53.901
Find cover!

01:22:54.002 --> 01:22:55.936
[gunfire]

01:22:56.036 --> 01:22:58.439
You got ammo?

01:22:58.539 --> 01:22:59.273
Yeah, man.

01:22:59.373 --> 01:23:00.508
What are we doing, Sergeant?

01:23:00.608 --> 01:23:02.209
You're gonna drive
us over to LRAS 2,

01:23:02.309 --> 01:23:03.244
and we're gonna get those
guys the fuck out of there.

01:23:03.344 --> 01:23:04.278
Sergeant, fucking that we are.

01:23:04.378 --> 01:23:05.213
Quick, get up in the turret.

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:07.748
Close that fucking door.

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:09.750
Oh, shut!

01:23:09.850 --> 01:23:10.652
Motherfucker.

01:23:10.752 --> 01:23:11.553
Ammo.

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:12.753
Gallegos, this is Hardt.

01:23:12.853 --> 01:23:13.721
We're driving to you now.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:14.855
Stay put.

01:23:14.955 --> 01:23:16.257
We're gonna get
you out of there.

01:23:16.357 --> 01:23:18.359
Do not drive that fucking
truck over here, Hardt.

01:23:18.459 --> 01:23:19.060
Do you hear me?

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.061
Keep fucking pushing!

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:20.729
GALLEGOS (ON RADIO): Hardt.

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:26.834
Are you good?

01:23:26.934 --> 01:23:27.769
Are you good?

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:28.736
Look at me.

01:23:28.836 --> 01:23:30.738
Griff, get down!

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:33.308
[gunfire]

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:34.308
Fuck, fuck.

01:23:34.409 --> 01:23:35.710
You good?

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:36.411
Can you drive?

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:37.044
Yeah.

01:23:37.144 --> 01:23:38.146
OK, OK, let's go.

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:39.713
We gotta get over there.

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:40.548
You good?

01:23:40.648 --> 01:23:41.216
Yes.

01:23:44.585 --> 01:23:45.186
We're fucking stuck.

01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:46.621
I think we're on a bump.

01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:47.622
Fuck!

01:23:47.722 --> 01:23:50.225
[explosion]

01:23:55.096 --> 01:23:55.996
GALLEGOS (ON RADIO): Hardt?

01:23:56.096 --> 01:23:57.232
Hardt, are you good?

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:57.965
Fuck.

01:23:58.065 --> 01:23:59.200
Gallegos, I'm sorry.

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.234
Fucking [inaudible], Gallegos.

01:24:00.334 --> 01:24:02.603
I'm sorry we couldn't help.

01:24:02.703 --> 01:24:03.871
Fuck, I'm sorry.

01:24:03.971 --> 01:24:04.973
Fuck!

01:24:05.073 --> 01:24:08.075
I fucking told you, man!

01:24:08.176 --> 01:24:10.478
Will you please get the
fuck out of here, man?

01:24:10.578 --> 01:24:12.447
Hang in there.

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:14.649
Sergeant, those
ANA don't look good.

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:16.050
What?

01:24:16.150 --> 01:24:16.951
I think we got people
in the fucking wire, man.

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:18.086
Jesus.

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:19.621
Those fucking Taliban.

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:21.889
Those fucking Taliban, let's
fucking kill those fuckers.

01:24:21.989 --> 01:24:23.024
All right, all
right, all right.

01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:24.025
Look at me.

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:25.226
This is what we're gonna do.

01:24:25.326 --> 01:24:26.393
You two are gonna
make a run for it.

01:24:26.493 --> 01:24:27.995
You're gonna run
like fucking hell.

01:24:28.095 --> 01:24:30.098
I'm gonna get in this turret,
and I'm gonna cover fire you.

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:30.931
- Yes.
- OK.

01:24:31.031 --> 01:24:32.200
Yes, Sergeant!

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:32.933
- I'll see you soon, guys.
- Fucking go.

01:24:33.034 --> 01:24:33.668
Let's go!

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:34.402
Fuck, yeah!

01:24:34.502 --> 01:24:34.802
Fuck yeah!

01:24:34.902 --> 01:24:36.337
Fuck!

01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:38.673

01:24:44.078 --> 01:24:45.546

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:48.849

01:24:48.949 --> 01:24:51.786
Allahu akbar!

01:24:51.886 --> 01:24:53.687
Lakis, on me!

01:24:53.788 --> 01:24:56.224
[gunfire]

01:24:57.358 --> 01:24:58.292
Friendly, friendly, friendly!

01:24:58.392 --> 01:24:59.460
- Whoa, shit.
- Sergeant.

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.561
Fuck!

01:25:00.661 --> 01:25:01.529
Charlie in the wire,
Charlie in the wire!

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:02.463
Who's Charlie?

01:25:02.563 --> 01:25:04.198
Fucking enemy,
enemy in the wire!

01:25:04.298 --> 01:25:06.066
HARDT (ON RADIO): Holy fuck.

01:25:06.166 --> 01:25:08.503
They've got an RPG
pointed right at me.

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:09.470
Hardt?

01:25:09.570 --> 01:25:10.438
[explosion]

01:25:10.538 --> 01:25:11.973
Hardt?

01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:14.942
Sarge, Griffin's dead, too.

01:25:15.042 --> 01:25:17.645
[speaking pashto]

01:25:17.745 --> 01:25:18.779
These your ANA?

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.615
Not mine.

01:25:20.715 --> 01:25:23.384
These cocksuckers
think they already won.

01:25:23.485 --> 01:25:25.720
[gunfire]

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:31.158
On me, hit 'em with the 203.

01:25:31.258 --> 01:25:32.360
MAN (ON RADIO): This is X-ray.

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.994
Enemy in the wire,
enemy in the wire.

01:25:34.094 --> 01:25:34.962
Everybody fall back.

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:35.963
You see?

01:25:36.063 --> 01:25:37.097
They're fucking everywhere.

01:25:37.197 --> 01:25:38.533
Sergeant, what
the fuck do we do?

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:40.334
MAN (ON RADIO): Enemy in
the wire, enemy in the wire.

01:25:40.434 --> 01:25:42.169
Everyone into Alamo position.

01:25:42.269 --> 01:25:44.471
No, not today.

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:45.072
Romesha.

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:46.307
Sergeant!

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:47.741
MAN (ON RADIO): This
is Black Knight 6.

01:25:47.842 --> 01:25:50.044
Quick reaction force has
landed on the mountain.

01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:51.645
We will be there
as soon as we can.

01:25:51.745 --> 01:25:52.814
Out.

01:25:52.914 --> 01:25:53.948
Roger, Captain Portis.

01:25:54.048 --> 01:25:55.349
We're gonna hang
onto what we can.

01:25:55.449 --> 01:25:58.052
But it'd be really fucking
nice to see you, sir.

01:25:58.152 --> 01:26:00.387
Over.

01:26:00.487 --> 01:26:02.656
Guidons, Guidons, Guidons.

01:26:02.756 --> 01:26:04.125
Alamo, Alamo, Alamo.

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:05.059
Collapse to the core.

01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:05.760
Fuck that.

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:09.964
We need to retake this camp.

01:26:10.064 --> 01:26:14.068
We don't have any mortars,
air support, the manpower.

01:26:14.168 --> 01:26:15.903
We don't have any
accountability.

01:26:16.003 --> 01:26:17.171
LT's right, Ro.

01:26:17.271 --> 01:26:18.806
We need to dig in,
hold on to what we can,

01:26:18.906 --> 01:26:19.941
and wait for support.

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:21.342
Stop.

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:24.111
Helicopters alone won't save us.

01:26:24.211 --> 01:26:26.347
Our ammo depot is 40 yards away.

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:28.749
It has everything we need
to stay in this fight.

01:26:28.849 --> 01:26:32.686
We start there, and
we plug our leaks.

01:26:32.786 --> 01:26:34.889
Take back our front
gate, where the enemy

01:26:34.989 --> 01:26:36.423
is just walking the fuck in.

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:39.494
And you get a machine
gun on that dining hall.

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:41.796
[explosion]

01:26:42.863 --> 01:26:43.964
Everybody good?

01:26:44.064 --> 01:26:44.732
We lost power!

01:26:44.832 --> 01:26:46.166
Everybody good?

01:26:46.266 --> 01:26:47.801
Hey, you good?

01:26:47.901 --> 01:26:48.669
LT.

01:26:48.769 --> 01:26:49.603
Are the radios up?

01:26:49.703 --> 01:26:53.807
LT, our men are
trapped out here.

01:26:53.907 --> 01:26:58.179
Let me do this, sir.

01:26:58.279 --> 01:27:00.081
You're sure you
can make it happen?

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:01.716
Yes.

01:27:01.816 --> 01:27:03.084
All right, if
we're gonna do this,

01:27:03.184 --> 01:27:04.184
we gotta call a net switch.

01:27:04.284 --> 01:27:05.453
We got enemy in the wire.

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:07.455
They probably got
one of our radios.

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:08.756
The men out there
that are trapped,

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:10.224
they're gonna be cut
off, but we gotta do it.

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:11.692
All right?

01:27:11.792 --> 01:27:12.160
Check?

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:13.461
Check.

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:16.697
Ro, wait for Hill's
machine gun, all right?

01:27:16.797 --> 01:27:17.365
Check.

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:24.239
X-ray, X-ray, do you copy?

01:27:26.406 --> 01:27:27.375
Motherfucking cocksucker!

01:27:30.010 --> 01:27:31.412
We lost comms, boys.

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:33.514
What's the plan, G?

01:27:33.614 --> 01:27:34.982
Gallegos, what are
we doing, Sergeant?

01:27:35.082 --> 01:27:36.450
OK, here's what we do.

01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:37.852
We take cover at the rocks.

01:27:37.952 --> 01:27:39.253
We go to latrins.

01:27:39.353 --> 01:27:41.155
We'll pass latrines, past
the laundry trailers,

01:27:41.255 --> 01:27:43.958
and then we haul ass to the TOC.

01:27:44.058 --> 01:27:45.559
I'll hang back
and provide cover.

01:27:45.659 --> 01:27:47.028
It's gonna take a
long fucking time.

01:27:47.128 --> 01:27:48.196
- I'll cover with you.
- Everybody in?

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:49.196
It's not up to us, man.

01:27:49.296 --> 01:27:49.931
You're senior.

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:50.864
It's on you.

01:27:50.964 --> 01:27:52.166
It's your decision.

01:27:52.266 --> 01:27:53.434
Mace, keep the fuck up.

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:54.735
Martin, you're gonna OK.

01:27:54.835 --> 01:27:55.836
Let's do it.

01:27:55.936 --> 01:27:57.138
Come on, bitch.

01:27:57.238 --> 01:27:58.105
Carter!

01:27:58.205 --> 01:27:59.073
Is everybody fucking in?

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:00.774
We're going first, Carter.

01:28:00.874 --> 01:28:01.709
I love you faggots.

01:28:01.809 --> 01:28:02.776
Larson, Carter,
you're out first.

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:03.478
Let's go.

01:28:03.578 --> 01:28:04.178
Fire!

01:28:04.278 --> 01:28:04.945
Let's fucking move it.

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:12.954
[shouting]

01:28:13.054 --> 01:28:13.921
RPG!

01:28:14.021 --> 01:28:16.257
[explosion]

01:28:16.357 --> 01:28:18.760
You guys OK?

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.594
Go, I got you covered!

01:28:20.694 --> 01:28:21.362
Go!

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:23.631
Get out of here!

01:28:23.731 --> 01:28:24.465
Get up.

01:28:24.565 --> 01:28:25.967
Mace is hurt, guys.

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:27.034
We're on you, we're on you.

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:28.201
Come on!

01:28:28.302 --> 01:28:29.770
Cover me!

01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:33.006
Carter, cover me!

01:28:33.106 --> 01:28:34.741
Shit, these motherfuckers!

01:28:34.841 --> 01:28:35.576
Go!

01:28:35.676 --> 01:28:38.045
Quit dragging your ass, shit!

01:28:38.145 --> 01:28:39.380
[explosion]

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:40.414
Come on, man.

01:28:40.514 --> 01:28:43.350
We're nearly there.

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:44.785
Gallegos!

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:46.019
[shouting]

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.021
I'm good.

01:28:48.122 --> 01:28:49.056
[gunfire]

01:28:49.156 --> 01:28:49.757
Motherfuckers!

01:28:53.093 --> 01:28:55.396
Gallegos is down!

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:56.964
How bad is it?

01:28:57.064 --> 01:29:00.334
Hey, watch your six!

01:29:00.434 --> 01:29:01.903
Coming to you!

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:02.636
Carter!

01:29:02.736 --> 01:29:03.705
Carter, get in the truck!

01:29:08.375 --> 01:29:10.278
What the fuck happened
to Mace and Martin?

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:11.445
Fuck!

01:29:11.545 --> 01:29:12.780
What happened to
Mace and Martin?

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.482
I don't know!

01:29:14.582 --> 01:29:19.553
Hey, Red Platoon,
I need volunteers.

01:29:19.653 --> 01:29:21.388
We're taking this bitch back.

01:29:21.488 --> 01:29:22.389
Hell yeah, Ro.

01:29:22.489 --> 01:29:23.057
Count me in.

01:29:23.891 --> 01:29:24.559
You got me?

01:29:24.659 --> 01:29:25.026
Good.

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:26.593
Gregory?

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:29.263
I don't think I
can make it, Ro.

01:29:29.363 --> 01:29:30.464
I've got his gun.

01:29:30.564 --> 01:29:32.032
Jones, good man.

01:29:32.132 --> 01:29:34.635
Miller, Danelly, let's go.

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:36.904

01:29:41.074 --> 01:29:43.544
Ow, mother-- shit.

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:51.952
[explosion]

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:55.322
Red 2, X-ray, where the
fuck's that machine gun?

01:29:55.422 --> 01:29:57.157
The machine gun is on its way.

01:29:57.257 --> 01:29:59.126
Just hang on.

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:01.729
[gunfire]

01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:04.699
X-ray, we gotta move.

01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:06.100
We gotta get to
the front gate now.

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.368
They're right on top of us.

01:30:07.468 --> 01:30:08.235
Negative, Red 2.

01:30:08.335 --> 01:30:09.236
Hold your position.

01:30:09.336 --> 01:30:10.404
Wait for cover fire.

01:30:10.504 --> 01:30:11.305
Sorry, what was that?

01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:12.473
You're coming in broken.

01:30:12.573 --> 01:30:13.874
BUNDERMANN (ON RADIO):
Goddamn it, Ro.

01:30:13.974 --> 01:30:16.109
No.

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:17.444
Oh, fuck.

01:30:17.544 --> 01:30:18.145
All right, guys.

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:19.913
Let's go.

01:30:20.014 --> 01:30:22.149
[gunfire]

01:30:22.249 --> 01:30:23.518
I've never killed
anyone before.

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:30.024
Me too.

01:30:30.124 --> 01:30:31.292
You got any smokes in that?

01:30:31.392 --> 01:30:32.193
What?

01:30:32.293 --> 01:30:34.896
A pack of cigarettes.

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:35.963
Wouldn't you be lucky.

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:43.671
[explosion]

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:45.006
Fuck.

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:45.973
Mace.

01:30:46.073 --> 01:30:47.441
Mace, he's crawling to us.

01:30:47.541 --> 01:30:48.275
Help me, please.

01:30:48.375 --> 01:30:50.377
Shit, it's Mace!

01:30:50.477 --> 01:30:52.580
He's crawling to us.

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.015
Mace is calling at us!

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:55.783
Tell him to get behind
that fucking rock for cover.

01:30:55.883 --> 01:30:56.417
Mace!

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:57.685
Behind the rock!

01:30:57.785 --> 01:30:58.752
Get the rock, get
cover behind the rock!

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:00.321
We'll come after
you in a second!

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:00.988
Fuck!

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:04.525
He's OK, man.
He has cover.

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:05.492
He's fucking bleeding.

01:31:05.592 --> 01:31:06.661
He's fucking bleeding out.

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:08.629
Carter, he has cover.

01:31:08.729 --> 01:31:09.764
Carter, what are you doing?

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:10.430
Take cover.

01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:11.665
I'm going out there.

01:31:11.765 --> 01:31:13.267
Carter, what the
fuck are you doing?

01:31:13.367 --> 01:31:14.268
Carter!

01:31:14.368 --> 01:31:15.335
What are you fucking doing, man?

01:31:15.435 --> 01:31:16.637
What the fuck?

01:31:16.737 --> 01:31:18.038
What do you mean, what
the fuck am I doing?

01:31:18.138 --> 01:31:19.307
He's bleeding out!

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:21.441
Dude, he has
fucking cover there.

01:31:21.541 --> 01:31:23.210
We have cover here.

01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:25.312
There are only two of us!

01:31:25.412 --> 01:31:26.547
wanna fucking die
trying to save him?

01:31:26.647 --> 01:31:28.549
Mace, wait, Mace, wait!

01:31:37.958 --> 01:31:40.927

You keep that gun up until
we get the front gate, OK?

01:32:22.169 --> 01:32:25.172
We take back the front gate,
we take back this outpost.

01:32:25.272 --> 01:32:26.707
Love the pressure, Ro.

01:32:26.807 --> 01:32:29.143
This net, any station, this
net, this is Red Dragon over.

I got half a mag left.

01:32:30.911 --> 01:32:33.180
You?

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:34.815
Take some of mine.

this is Red Dragon, over.

01:32:39.386 --> 01:32:41.722
Think there's any
one of us alive?

01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:44.558
Think we're it, huh?

01:32:44.658 --> 01:32:45.626
I don't know, man.

01:32:45.726 --> 01:32:46.794
I can get to him.

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:48.228
Larson, I can
fucking get to him.

01:32:48.328 --> 01:32:49.530
He's right fucking there.

01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:51.832
Dead bodies attract
dead bodies, all right?

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:55.269
I don't want you trying
to win a fucking medal.

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:58.205
Hey, Mace, stay right
there, don't fucking move!

01:32:58.305 --> 01:33:00.875
We're coming as soon as we can!

Stop.

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.522
What are you gonna do
when you get to him?

01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:16.523
I'm gonna render
him fucking aid, man.

01:33:16.623 --> 01:33:18.092
Where are you gonna take him?

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:20.360
His best chance
is in here with us.

01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:21.028
I agree.

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:21.528
Agreed?

01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:22.529

I'll cover you, OK?

Conserve your fucking ammo.

Oh, baby, you're looking good.

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:10.277
All right, man, just

No, you're not.

No, you're not, fucker.

You're dying of fucking cancer.

01:35:17.311 --> 01:35:17.778
Get in the truck.

01:35:17.878 --> 01:35:20.180
I'll cover you!

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:20.848
Thanks!

01:35:24.284 --> 01:35:25.185
Get in the truck!

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:27.187
Fuck me.

01:35:27.287 --> 01:35:27.888
Fuck me.

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:32.059
Mace!

01:35:32.159 --> 01:35:34.428
Mace!

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:35.428
Mace!

01:35:35.528 --> 01:35:38.064
You guys got a cigarette?

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:42.736

01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:44.205
Stop, Raz.

01:35:58.151 --> 01:36:00.020
Friendly, friendly, friendly.

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:03.590
Geez, Raz, hit him
with a CS grenade?

01:36:03.690 --> 01:36:05.759
No, high explosive, standard.

01:36:05.859 --> 01:36:06.760
Get the fire extinguisher.

01:36:06.861 --> 01:36:08.028
Good shot.

01:36:08.128 --> 01:36:10.230
Go.

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:11.198
ECP clear.

01:36:11.298 --> 01:36:12.132
Take the guards out.

01:36:12.232 --> 01:36:14.001
Go.

01:36:14.101 --> 01:36:17.103
Just a little air
support now, boys.

01:36:22.008 --> 01:36:23.376
X-ray, we're at the front gate.

01:36:23.476 --> 01:36:25.145
No one's getting in here.

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:27.515
[gunfire]

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:33.053
Oh, shit.

01:36:39.359 --> 01:36:39.960
Oh.

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.227
Oh, come on, come on.

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:41.862
Oh, shit.

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:44.264
There's too many.

01:36:44.364 --> 01:36:47.500
God help us all.

Thank you for
your service, ma'am.

01:37:17.397 --> 01:37:19.166

more where that came from.

01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:35.382
He's not gonna make it.

01:37:35.482 --> 01:37:36.616
Yeah, I know.

01:37:36.716 --> 01:37:37.717
So I'm gonna go on recon.

01:37:37.817 --> 01:37:39.286
If I'm not back in
10 minutes, then

01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:40.587
I made it or don't
worry about me.

01:37:40.687 --> 01:37:42.389
Eyes open.

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:43.190
You got me?

01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:43.958
Hm, yeah. fuck.

01:37:49.597 --> 01:37:50.497
Yo, Mace.

01:37:50.597 --> 01:37:51.632
No, fucking what?

01:37:51.732 --> 01:37:53.533
Gun to your head.

01:37:53.633 --> 01:37:54.802
Gun to my head?

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:55.502
Gun to your head,
a guy you gotta fuck.

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:56.336
Who is it?

01:37:56.436 --> 01:37:57.237
Gun to your head.

01:37:57.338 --> 01:37:57.771
Oh, fuck.

01:37:57.871 --> 01:37:58.672
Which guy?

01:37:58.772 --> 01:38:00.740
Fucking, uh--

Keep your eyes open, Mace.

01:38:50.623 --> 01:38:51.358
Keep them open.

01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:52.559
Mace, look, look.

01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:56.764
I heard American voices!

01:38:56.864 --> 01:38:58.031
Get in here, get
in here, get in here!

01:38:58.131 --> 01:38:59.767
You hear that, Mace?

01:38:59.867 --> 01:39:01.401
X-ray, X-ray, this
is Red Dragon, over.

01:39:01.501 --> 01:39:03.971
This is the high
point right there.

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:04.938
Red Dragon, go ahead.

01:39:05.038 --> 01:39:06.540
What's going on?

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.708
We're still trapped in LRAS 2.

01:39:08.808 --> 01:39:10.043
Gallegos is KIA.

01:39:10.143 --> 01:39:11.544
Hardt's missing.

01:39:11.644 --> 01:39:12.979
Carter and I are OK.

01:39:13.079 --> 01:39:14.014
And Mace is pretty jacked up.

01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:15.582
He's hurting surgical.

01:39:15.682 --> 01:39:17.551
He's gonna need to get the aid
station as soon as possible.

01:39:17.651 --> 01:39:20.086
We need some serious
covering fire, over.

01:39:20.186 --> 01:39:22.222
Glad to hear you boys
are still breathing.

01:39:22.322 --> 01:39:24.892
I'm gonna wrangle
you some cover.

01:39:24.992 --> 01:39:27.127
We got a B1 bomber
coming in from Qatar.

01:39:27.227 --> 01:39:29.996
When it drops its payload,
it's gonna be a son of a bitch.

01:39:30.096 --> 01:39:33.633
When it hits, I need every
weapon we have on camp.

01:39:33.733 --> 01:39:35.569
LRAS 2, that ought to be
enough cover for you guys

01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:36.903
to make a run for it, over.

01:39:37.003 --> 01:39:37.804

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:44.010
Let these fuckers go.

01:39:44.110 --> 01:39:45.011
Hey, stay put.

01:39:45.111 --> 01:39:46.479

We're gonna get close.

01:39:57.991 --> 01:39:59.826
Carter, good luck, man.

01:39:59.926 --> 01:40:00.927

Let's go!

01:40:08.135 --> 01:40:09.168
Hang the fuck on, Mace!

01:40:09.268 --> 01:40:12.906
We're hauling fucking ass!

01:40:15.509 --> 01:40:16.042

There's Griffin!

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:25.786

01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:26.787
Move!

01:40:26.887 --> 01:40:28.021
Come on!

01:40:28.121 --> 01:40:28.755
You got it, Carter.

01:40:28.855 --> 01:40:30.357
Keep going.

We're coming in!

01:40:45.839 --> 01:40:46.473
We got Mace!

01:40:46.573 --> 01:40:47.174
We're coming in!

01:40:49.743 --> 01:40:50.977
Make way!

01:40:51.078 --> 01:40:53.980
Make way!

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:54.948
Carter, let go.

01:40:55.048 --> 01:40:55.782
Let go, Carter.

01:40:55.882 --> 01:40:56.549
Carter!

01:40:56.649 --> 01:40:57.151
Let go, Carter!

01:41:00.821 --> 01:41:03.290

01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:08.929
Stay with us.

01:41:09.029 --> 01:41:13.033
I put the tourniquet
on 15 minutes ago.

01:41:13.133 --> 01:41:15.669

01:41:15.769 --> 01:41:17.437
15 minutes.

01:41:17.537 --> 01:41:18.571
45.

01:41:18.671 --> 01:41:21.675
He's been bleeding
out for 45 minutes.

01:41:21.775 --> 01:41:24.144
[screaming]

01:41:26.846 --> 01:41:28.548
Come on, Mace, hang in there.

01:41:28.648 --> 01:41:29.650
hang in there, Mace!

01:41:33.353 --> 01:41:36.590
Fuck yeah, you
beautiful fuckers!

01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:37.791

01:41:37.891 --> 01:41:38.959

01:41:39.059 --> 01:41:39.926
Damn glad to see you.

01:41:40.026 --> 01:41:40.827
Yellow.

01:41:40.927 --> 01:41:41.828
I love you, too, man.

Activity on the Northface.

01:41:44.097 --> 01:41:45.899
Hardt and Martin are missing.

01:41:45.999 --> 01:41:49.769
Griffin and Gallegos are KIA.

01:41:49.869 --> 01:41:52.439
Hey, you know where they are?

01:41:52.539 --> 01:41:53.940
Got a stent in
your carotid artery.

01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:57.010
His body's sending all his
blood to his vital organs.

01:41:57.110 --> 01:41:58.178
- That's good.
- No, no, no, stay with me.

01:41:58.278 --> 01:41:59.512
Hey, Cordova,
that's good, right?

01:41:59.613 --> 01:42:01.181
No, it's not.
His blood pressure's too weak.

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:02.015
If he doesn't get out of
this valley in the next hour,

01:42:02.115 --> 01:42:03.583
he won't make it.

01:42:03.683 --> 01:42:04.852
And there's no birds getting
in here till after nightfall.

01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:09.156
It's time to get radical.

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:10.356
As you can hear, air
support is out there, doing

01:42:10.456 --> 01:42:12.892
the Lord's fucking work, right?

01:42:12.992 --> 01:42:15.362
Captain Portis and the quick
reaction force is on their way.

01:42:15.462 --> 01:42:16.897
We're almost done, guys.

01:42:26.806 --> 01:42:29.275
X-ray, this is Black
Knights 6 with the QRF.

01:42:29.375 --> 01:42:31.578

01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:35.815

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:44.691

01:42:46.526 --> 01:42:48.394
I think I see the last of 'em.

500 meters north, 50 degrees.

01:42:51.031 --> 01:42:52.065
Let's end this thing.

01:42:52.165 --> 01:42:53.200

01:43:22.895 --> 01:43:24.264
Glad they're on our side.

01:43:27.767 --> 01:43:28.801
A positive.

01:43:28.901 --> 01:43:29.569
I'm A positive.

01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:30.403
I'm A positive.

01:43:30.503 --> 01:43:31.170
Hey, Doc, What Does that mean?

01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:32.405
What's going on?

01:43:32.505 --> 01:43:33.940
We can't perform
surgery on him here.

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:35.609
And what the fuck
does that mean?

01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:37.777
Medevac won't be
here for a few hours,

01:43:37.877 --> 01:43:40.079
which means he needs fresh
blood, if he wants to live.

01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:41.481
This is the only
thing we can do.

01:43:41.581 --> 01:43:42.749
We're not sterile, and we
can't test for disease.

01:43:42.849 --> 01:43:43.883
OK.

01:43:43.984 --> 01:43:45.419
Our fresh blood is all
we can do to save him.

01:43:45.519 --> 01:43:45.952
Fuck.

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:46.652
Come on.

01:43:46.753 --> 01:43:47.520
Hey, Mace.

01:43:47.621 --> 01:43:48.422
Mace, come on.
Stick with me.

01:43:48.522 --> 01:43:49.755
You'll be good, buddy.

01:43:49.856 --> 01:43:51.224
You might be a little
light in the loafers,

01:43:51.324 --> 01:43:52.725
because it's fucking
officer blood, but--

01:43:52.825 --> 01:43:54.427
All right, I need you to
put a call in on the radio.

01:43:54.527 --> 01:43:55.395
Everybody with A positive
blood needs to get their ass

01:43:55.495 --> 01:43:56.696
to the aid station, OK?

01:43:56.796 --> 01:44:00.033
We need as much fucking
blood as we can get.

01:44:00.133 --> 01:44:02.603
[helicopter flies overhead]

01:44:08.007 --> 01:44:08.875
Fuck, Mohamed.

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:16.316
I told you the
Taliban would attack.

01:44:16.416 --> 01:44:17.217
I know my country.

01:44:17.317 --> 01:44:18.652
All right, go, go, go.

01:44:18.752 --> 01:44:20.153
Heard on the radio
you guys need blood.

01:44:20.253 --> 01:44:21.688
Yeah, we need a second bag.
You A positive?

01:44:21.788 --> 01:44:22.522
A fucking positive.

01:44:22.622 --> 01:44:24.123
All right, give me this.

01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:25.458
All right.

01:44:25.559 --> 01:44:26.359
- You all right, Mace?
- Stay with me, buddy.

01:44:26.459 --> 01:44:27.627
You all right, Mace?

01:44:27.727 --> 01:44:28.595
We're gonna get you
medevac soon, Mace.

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:29.729
How's he doing?

01:44:29.829 --> 01:44:30.763
We fucking won, man.

01:44:30.863 --> 01:44:31.431
We fucking won.

01:44:44.845 --> 01:44:46.446
We'll get you back home
to Amanda and Mac, man.

01:44:46.546 --> 01:44:47.914
Come on, you're good.

01:44:48.014 --> 01:44:49.015
Come on, motherfucker.

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:50.417
Let's go.

01:44:50.517 --> 01:44:51.284
Come on.
You got him?

01:44:51.384 --> 01:44:51.985
You got him?

01:44:52.085 --> 01:44:52.752
Yeah.

01:44:52.852 --> 01:44:53.386
Come on, bro.

01:44:53.486 --> 01:44:54.887
Come on, bro.

01:44:54.987 --> 01:44:56.456
Come on, bro.

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:57.324
You're good, man.

01:45:17.043 --> 01:45:18.745
I'm Lieutenant Bundermann.

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:19.713
Captain Portis.

01:45:19.813 --> 01:45:20.814
Welcome to Outpost
Keating, sir.

01:45:23.616 --> 01:45:25.785
All your men accounted
for, Lieutenant?

01:45:25.885 --> 01:45:32.192
27 wounded, seven dead, a
dozen ANA severely wounded.

01:45:32.292 --> 01:45:33.593
Specialist Mace is
pretty banged up.

01:45:33.693 --> 01:45:36.430
The medics are--
they're optimistic, sir.

01:45:38.898 --> 01:45:40.067
He's got all of
our blood in him.

01:45:46.406 --> 01:45:47.273
[sniffling]

01:45:47.373 --> 01:45:48.241
I'm sorry, sir.

01:45:48.341 --> 01:45:48.942
I know now's not the time.

01:45:52.311 --> 01:45:54.781
It is the time.

01:45:54.881 --> 01:45:59.652
Lieutenant, you did
a hell of a job here.

01:45:59.752 --> 01:46:00.921
You took fucking command.

01:46:07.727 --> 01:46:11.163
What do you
wanna salvage, sir?

01:46:11.264 --> 01:46:13.800
Nothing.

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:16.837
Tomorrow, we blow this shithole
off the face of the earth.

01:46:23.176 --> 01:46:24.444
That Hardt?

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:25.112
Yes, Sergeant.

01:46:33.487 --> 01:46:34.054
Sergeant?

01:46:37.057 --> 01:46:37.657
Yeah, OK.

01:46:55.441 --> 01:46:57.911
[singing in the distance]

01:47:05.285 --> 01:47:05.886
A smoke?

01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:15.461
Thanks.

01:47:15.561 --> 01:47:16.429
(SINGING) Beneath
the darkening sky,

01:47:16.529 --> 01:47:18.665
we start to question why.

01:47:18.765 --> 01:47:26.106
And fear wakes up the beast,
and the devil comes to feast,

01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:36.049
as we sink in mortal sand on
the road to the edge of man.

01:47:40.486 --> 01:47:45.691
And who will be the last to die?

01:47:45.791 --> 01:47:49.496
Fucking weird, isn't it?

01:47:49.596 --> 01:47:53.033
I kind of wish we were given
the same consideration.

01:47:53.133 --> 01:47:53.700
Yeah.

01:47:56.603 --> 01:47:59.072
[helicopter flying overhead]

01:48:01.107 --> 01:48:01.675
Medevac.

01:48:06.579 --> 01:48:10.049
How you doing, dickhead?

01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:11.050
Fuck you.

01:48:11.150 --> 01:48:12.052
[chuckling]

01:48:12.152 --> 01:48:15.055
Yeah.

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:17.624
You, you saved my life.

01:48:21.127 --> 01:48:23.029
Be good, Carter.

01:48:23.129 --> 01:48:23.929
What?

01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:24.598
Be good!

01:48:29.102 --> 01:48:31.905
Carter!

01:48:32.005 --> 01:48:32.606
Carter, let's go.

01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:35.842
Faulkner, Ro, you
guys are injured.

01:48:35.942 --> 01:48:37.977
I need you to get on that
bird and leave tonight.

01:48:38.077 --> 01:48:41.080
I wanna leave with everybody
else, sir, if that's OK.

01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:42.015
We're good, sir.

01:49:29.262 --> 01:49:30.196
Yo, run the line all the way.

01:49:33.466 --> 01:49:35.769
It won't fit on the truck,
you put it where it'll burn.

01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:44.110
[helicopter flying]

01:50:07.133 --> 01:50:08.001
Yeah, roger.

01:50:14.206 --> 01:50:15.909
Mace didn't make it.

01:50:16.009 --> 01:50:17.644
What?

01:50:17.744 --> 01:50:19.079
Mace didn't make it!

01:50:36.429 --> 01:50:38.898
[explosions]

01:50:53.679 --> 01:50:56.149
[chattering]

01:51:11.264 --> 01:51:13.767
[dialing]

01:51:21.608 --> 01:51:24.878
[ringing]

01:51:24.978 --> 01:51:26.079
WOMAN (ON PHONE): Hello?

01:51:29.549 --> 01:51:30.383
Hello?

01:51:30.483 --> 01:51:31.184
Hon, is-- is that you?

01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:37.890
I'm happy you came to talk.

01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:40.893
Well, Sergeant
Hal said I had to.

01:51:40.993 --> 01:51:42.228
Well, you don't have to.

01:51:42.328 --> 01:51:42.929
Only if you want to.

01:51:43.029 --> 01:51:44.431
He said I needed to.

01:51:49.401 --> 01:51:50.636
You're very pretty.

01:51:50.736 --> 01:51:51.304
Thank you.

01:51:54.139 --> 01:51:55.742
So can you tell
me what happened?

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:01.381
What?

01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:03.449
When?

01:52:03.549 --> 01:52:04.184
During the battle.

01:52:07.487 --> 01:52:09.922
What-- what about it?

01:52:10.022 --> 01:52:13.026
Do you remember what happened
with you in the battle?

01:52:13.126 --> 01:52:13.493
Mm-hm.

01:52:25.438 --> 01:52:26.606
I didn't save him.

01:52:26.706 --> 01:52:28.641
I didn't save him.

01:52:28.741 --> 01:52:31.244
Who?

01:52:31.344 --> 01:52:33.612
Mace.

01:52:33.712 --> 01:52:37.182
Mace, he was your friend.

01:52:37.282 --> 01:52:38.684
No.

01:52:38.784 --> 01:52:39.953
No, he was not.

01:52:51.597 --> 01:52:52.131
I'm scared.

01:52:52.231 --> 01:52:53.466
I know.

01:52:53.566 --> 01:52:54.801
It's scary, but I promise it
will help to talk about it.

01:52:57.637 --> 01:52:59.104
I'm sorry.

01:52:59.205 --> 01:52:59.872
It's OK.

01:52:59.972 --> 01:53:01.340
Give me a sec.

01:53:01.441 --> 01:53:02.041
It's OK.

01:53:10.716 --> 01:53:12.751
Ty, can you breathe for me?

01:53:12.851 --> 01:53:15.555
[breathing quickly]

01:53:15.655 --> 01:53:17.823
In and out.

01:53:17.923 --> 01:53:20.392
I'm breathing.

01:53:20.492 --> 01:53:22.528
I'm breathing.

01:53:22.628 --> 01:53:26.099
I'm-- I'm breathing.

01:54:08.474 --> 01:54:14.347
SONG: Everybody
cries, everybody dies.

01:54:14.447 --> 01:54:17.884
It's the truth that
makes sense one.

01:54:17.984 --> 01:54:21.487
It's the center of our sun.

01:54:21.587 --> 01:54:29.095
As we take the lonely path on
the road to the edge of man.

01:54:32.298 --> 01:54:37.136
Beneath the darkening
sky, we curse and wonder

01:54:37.236 --> 01:54:45.611
why as fear wakes up the beast
and the devil comes to feast,

01:54:45.711 --> 01:54:57.023
and we sink in mortal sand on
the road to the edge of man.

01:54:58.458 --> 01:55:07.600
Who will be the last to die
In a land where empires cry?

01:55:10.503 --> 01:55:15.607
Who will be the
last to remain where

01:55:15.707 --> 01:55:22.648
there's only God and pain?

01:55:22.748 --> 01:55:28.754
There's nothing more brave than
those voices from the grave.

01:55:28.854 --> 01:55:32.925
Only they can tell us why.

01:55:33.025 --> 01:55:35.194
Only they will never lie.

01:55:35.294 --> 01:55:43.603
About the reason that we stand
on the road to the edge of man.

01:55:46.472 --> 01:55:57.583
Who will be the last to die
in a land where empires cry?

01:55:58.851 --> 01:56:04.156
Who will be the
last to remain where

01:56:04.256 --> 01:56:08.294
there's only God and pain?

01:56:12.198 --> 01:56:17.136
They warn us of the lie
with a mournful battle

01:56:17.236 --> 01:56:25.777
cry of the reckoning at hand
as we reach the edge of man

01:56:25.877 --> 01:56:30.716
and make our final stand.

01:56:30.816 --> 01:56:34.520
There's nowhere
left to pray where

01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:45.732
there's only God and pain,
where there's only God.

01:57:05.517 --> 01:57:06.785
He was on his--

01:57:06.885 --> 01:57:10.456
he was on his forearms, and
his elbows, and he went behind.

01:57:10.556 --> 01:57:13.659
He went towards--
towards Gallegos.

01:57:13.759 --> 01:57:16.762
And that's when I said, "hey,
Sergeant Larson, Mace is alive.

01:57:16.862 --> 01:57:17.596
I can get to him.

01:57:17.696 --> 01:57:18.865
He's right there."

01:57:18.965 --> 01:57:21.167
And, uh, I think he
looked, and he says,

01:57:21.267 --> 01:57:22.668
"no, you can't get to him."

01:57:22.768 --> 01:57:23.769
I says, "no, he's right there.

01:57:23.869 --> 01:57:25.070
I can get to him."

01:57:25.170 --> 01:57:26.506
And he says, "you're
no good to him dead."

01:57:26.606 --> 01:57:27.840
And-- uh, and I knew.

01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:32.412
I knew he was right, but it--
it-- it ate me up so bad.

01:57:35.748 --> 01:57:36.682
I need a break.
Hold on.

01:57:36.782 --> 01:57:37.350
Yeah.

01:57:39.251 --> 01:57:40.353
Take as much time as you need.

01:57:45.591 --> 01:57:48.828
Finished out the belt
and scurried on back,

01:57:48.928 --> 01:57:53.266
and I called Gallegos
and told him--

01:58:00.873 --> 01:58:03.875
I told him I was sorry.

01:58:03.975 --> 01:58:08.246
Clint, you're one guy with no
ammunition, facing 400 Taliban,

01:58:08.347 --> 01:58:11.950
all of whom have
the high ground.

01:58:12.050 --> 01:58:13.286
You could always try, though.

01:58:15.688 --> 01:58:20.593
We'd landed, uh, at
nighttime, but even

01:58:20.693 --> 01:58:23.896
at night, you could tell the
silhouettes of the mountain

01:58:23.996 --> 01:58:25.264
and the sky were--

01:58:28.033 --> 01:58:30.736
did not give us-- it did not
give you a very good sense

01:58:30.836 --> 01:58:32.004
of "this is a safe place."

01:58:32.104 --> 01:58:34.206
It gave me a quick
sense of impending doom,

01:58:34.307 --> 01:58:35.741
that it was just
a matter of time

01:58:35.841 --> 01:58:39.545
before a bad thing happens,
and-- and we're gonna--

01:58:39.645 --> 01:58:40.780
we'll be in trouble.

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:45.350
I remember when I first
landed at-- at-- at Keating.

01:58:45.450 --> 01:58:46.519
I got off the helicopter.

01:58:46.619 --> 01:58:48.220
And when you got
off the helicopter,

01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:49.788
you're supposed to take a
knee, because the propeller

01:58:49.888 --> 01:58:54.026
blades create such a prop blast
that it, like, pushes you over.

01:58:54.127 --> 01:58:55.795
But I was just, like,
staring with my mouth

01:58:55.895 --> 01:58:57.363
open, looking at the--

01:58:57.463 --> 01:58:59.665
at all, like, the mountains,
and just being in the valley,

01:58:59.765 --> 01:59:01.033
and it was so strange.

01:59:01.133 --> 01:59:03.302
I remember being down
in the middle of it,

01:59:03.402 --> 01:59:05.671
and just looking
up, and up, and up.

01:59:05.771 --> 01:59:11.677
And finally, I could see, like,
the-- the top of-- of the--

01:59:11.777 --> 01:59:13.212
the switchbacks.

01:59:13.312 --> 01:59:15.080
And it was just like
that all the way around.

01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:17.482
Being able to play myself is--

01:59:17.583 --> 01:59:18.184
is unique.

01:59:18.284 --> 01:59:19.719
You know, it's a very--

01:59:19.819 --> 01:59:22.287
I don't know if that happens
very often in this industry.

01:59:22.387 --> 01:59:25.324
But as we were saying,
just the realness of here,

01:59:25.424 --> 01:59:26.926
it's put me back
into that mindset,

01:59:27.026 --> 01:59:30.395
and I've tried to embrace that,
you know, with the uniform

01:59:30.495 --> 01:59:33.933
and, you know, the names of all
those soldiers that were lost,

01:59:34.033 --> 01:59:35.468
that are still
walking around here,

01:59:35.568 --> 01:59:37.770
you know, doing their role.

01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:39.038
I think it's special, you know.

01:59:39.138 --> 01:59:40.939
And to be able to
play myself, I'm very

01:59:41.039 --> 01:59:42.741
grateful that I'm still alive.

01:59:42.841 --> 01:59:46.878
And it's almost an obligation,
I feel, to-- to bring

01:59:46.978 --> 01:59:48.748
authenticity to this film.

01:59:48.848 --> 01:59:53.952
At-- at LRAS 2, five men
gave their lives to save mine.

01:59:54.052 --> 01:59:57.156
They were either directly at
that position or supporting it.

01:59:57.256 --> 01:59:59.491
And so when I wear the
medal, I think about them.

01:59:59.591 --> 02:00:04.129
I also wear the-- the memorial
bracelet, and in fact,

02:00:04.229 --> 02:00:06.231
most people think
of Memorial Day

02:00:06.331 --> 02:00:09.034
as a-- a time to celebrate or--

02:00:09.134 --> 02:00:12.371
or have hot dogs, but it's
actually a very somber time,

02:00:12.471 --> 02:00:17.643
to where we recognize what a lot
of men and women have died for.

02:00:17.743 --> 02:00:20.679
When I came in with the
QRF down the switchbacks,

02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:24.349
it was nighttime, and
you could see the flames

02:00:24.449 --> 02:00:26.852
against the canyon walls.

02:00:29.488 --> 02:00:33.358
Um, and in the-- the flicker
of the flames kind of dancing

02:00:33.458 --> 02:00:36.629
on the canyon walls behind
it, and in the buildings

02:00:36.729 --> 02:00:39.331
over the course of
that night, started--

02:00:39.431 --> 02:00:40.632
they-- they were razed.

02:00:40.732 --> 02:00:42.601
I mean, they started
falling to the ground.

02:00:42.701 --> 02:00:43.902
Yeah.

02:00:44.002 --> 02:00:49.374
Um, and I remember as I--
as I walked the outpost when

02:00:49.474 --> 02:00:52.611
the-- when the battle was
over, and the buildings were

02:00:52.711 --> 02:00:55.914
literally falling to
the ground, I would see,

02:00:56.014 --> 02:01:01.620
um, black spots on the ground
that were dark as motor oil.

02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:04.056
And then the-- the
flame, the light

02:01:04.156 --> 02:01:07.126
of the flames from the buildings
would kind of illuminate it,

02:01:07.226 --> 02:01:11.296
just enough for me to see
that it was a very deep color

02:01:11.396 --> 02:01:12.865
of red, and that's
when I realized,

02:01:12.965 --> 02:01:17.169
oh, this is where-- this is
where one of our soldiers died.

02:01:17.269 --> 02:01:23.742
It's a very hard
terrain out in Nuristan.

02:01:23.842 --> 02:01:26.679
It's is incredibly
difficult to--

02:01:26.779 --> 02:01:29.982
to win a battle when you're
in the low ground like that.

02:01:30.082 --> 02:01:31.550
It's-- it's near impossible.

02:01:31.650 --> 02:01:33.119
I mean, the only reason it was
possible for these guys was

02:01:33.219 --> 02:01:37.689
because of some very strong
leadership, uh, at the camp

02:01:37.789 --> 02:01:42.995
itself, and because they had an
immense amount of air support,

02:01:43.095 --> 02:01:44.897
um, once it finally came in.

02:01:44.997 --> 02:01:48.033
I want people to know
about Stephan Mace.

02:01:48.133 --> 02:01:52.104
I want, you know, more people to
know about Justin Gallegos, uh,

02:01:52.204 --> 02:01:53.639
and the six others
who died that day.

02:01:53.739 --> 02:01:56.141
Vernon Martin, I knew him for--

02:01:56.241 --> 02:01:58.176
for about three or four years.

02:01:58.276 --> 02:01:59.612
Scusa, I knew him
for about three

02:01:59.712 --> 02:02:01.047
or four years from our
deployment to Iraq together.

02:02:01.147 --> 02:02:04.016
And so, I mean, these, they
were incredible people,

02:02:04.116 --> 02:02:06.618
incredible humans.

02:02:06.718 --> 02:02:09.921
Uh, that-- I think
it's important, uh,

02:02:10.021 --> 02:02:14.059
for more people to know,
uh, about these eight that

02:02:14.159 --> 02:02:16.595
sacrificed themselves and
hopefully spark an interest

02:02:16.695 --> 02:02:19.665
in learning more about
others that have sacrificed

02:02:19.765 --> 02:02:21.867
themselves for the greater
good of-- of the United

02:02:21.967 --> 02:02:23.435
States' security.

02:02:23.535 --> 02:02:25.137
In my own words,
I would describe

02:02:25.237 --> 02:02:28.740
Combat Outpost Keating as a--

02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.108
I don't know.

02:02:30.208 --> 02:02:33.411
I read somewhere in the-- in
the Bible, the gates of heaven

02:02:33.512 --> 02:02:36.014
and the gates of hell
are in the same spot.

02:02:36.114 --> 02:02:39.885
So at the time of the
firefight, this was the--

02:02:39.985 --> 02:02:41.253
the gates of hell.

02:02:41.353 --> 02:02:45.857
But watching men, you know,
sacrifice themselves to protect

02:02:45.957 --> 02:02:49.094
each other, you can see
the true form of what, uh,

02:02:49.194 --> 02:02:50.662
brotherhood and love is.

02:02:50.762 --> 02:02:53.899
And so therefore, it would be
the gates of heaven as well.

02:02:53.999 --> 02:02:56.802
That's the best way
I can describe it.
