WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:10.040
This programme contains
some strong language

00:11.440 --> 00:15.040
'Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys!'

00:15.040 --> 00:18.320
# She's Mrs Brown

00:18.320 --> 00:20.960
# That's Mrs Brown

00:20.960 --> 00:24.120
# Our Mrs Brown. #

00:26.240 --> 00:28.560
KNOCK AT DOOR
Door!

00:29.720 --> 00:31.240
KNOCKING CONTINUES

00:31.240 --> 00:32.600
Door!

00:34.160 --> 00:35.760
KNOCKING PERSISTS

00:35.760 --> 00:37.520
The door!

00:37.520 --> 00:39.520
Is that where it is, Grandad?

00:39.520 --> 00:43.120
Thanks very much!
Me very own feckin' sat-nav!

00:44.680 --> 00:46.600
KNOCK AT DOOR

00:46.600 --> 00:48.960
You better be a buckin' woodpecker!

00:49.960 --> 00:51.840
Oh. Thank you.

00:52.840 --> 00:56.640
Ah, that's nice.
Someone's getting flowers.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.640
Are they for me? No, Grandad.
It's a bouquet, not a wreath!

01:03.600 --> 01:08.160
"To the most beautiful woman
in the world." They're for me!

01:08.160 --> 01:12.480
"To my wife,
just because I love you." Aw!

01:12.480 --> 01:14.960
That'll brighten Maria's day.

01:14.960 --> 01:17.800
It's nice to see Dermot
doing things like that.

01:17.800 --> 01:21.760
Especially so close to the birth
of the twins. Just weeks to go.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.520
Morning. Look! Flowers!

01:24.520 --> 01:27.080
Yes, for you!
They're beautiful. But why?

01:27.080 --> 01:30.720
Just because. That's romance, Maria.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.840
And that's the Brown way.

01:32.840 --> 01:38.480
I haven't got time to put them in a
vase. I'll look after them. Thanks,
Mrs Brown. Ah, they're so lovely!

01:40.360 --> 01:45.520
Dermot. His father wasn't
like that. You must be joking.

01:45.520 --> 01:49.240
The only time I saw Redser
in the same room as flowers
was his funeral!

01:50.880 --> 01:54.040
No, Dermot's a romantic.
He gets that from me.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.640
It's that time of year
and love is in the air.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.920
I hate you! I hate you!

02:00.920 --> 02:05.280
You can sit down! I don't want
to sit down! Suit yourself!
Don't you worry. I will!

02:05.280 --> 02:08.280
Like you always do...
I've had a good teacher!

02:13.120 --> 02:16.640
That one's mine. And that one.
And I think this is mine.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.520
You can think again.
That's buckin' mine.

02:19.520 --> 02:26.680
There should be another one
with this. It's a double album.
Where is it? I ate it! Ooh-hoo-hoo!

02:26.680 --> 02:28.600
Bastard!

02:30.400 --> 02:33.040
Are you two fighting?

02:33.040 --> 02:35.280
Mammy, did you hear that?!

02:35.280 --> 02:39.000
I know. Come here. Ssh, now, now.
I know.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.120
Me, a bastard!

02:44.160 --> 02:46.240
Technically you're not!

02:46.240 --> 02:49.360
Technically?! Oh!

02:49.360 --> 02:51.200
Rory!

02:51.200 --> 02:52.760
Granny!

02:52.760 --> 02:54.840
Bono!

02:54.840 --> 02:57.280
Oh, me little man,
let me look at you.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.560
Ooh, now, what's all this?
I'm a Indian, Granny!

03:00.560 --> 03:05.120
An Indian! Here, little Indian,
go in and play with your grandad.
I'll be in to you in a minute.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.320
Thanks for keeping an eye on him.
I won't be long at the dentist.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.520
No problem. I love having him
around. He brightens up the place.

03:11.520 --> 03:15.760
And you're going to be longer
at the dentist than you think
with those buck teeth!

03:17.360 --> 03:19.280
Hello, Ma. Hello, son!

03:19.280 --> 03:22.440
Oh, what beautiful flowers.
Flowers? Who got them?

03:22.440 --> 03:25.840
Maria. They came this morning.
Actually... Maria was delighted!

03:25.840 --> 03:27.640
Was she? Yes.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.760
Is it an anniversary or something?
No. Just because.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.800
Och, that's so romantic. Isn't it?

03:33.800 --> 03:36.080
Yeah. Very romantic.

03:36.080 --> 03:40.400
I wish you'd do something like that
for me. You're not romantic at all.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.960
He used to be...
before he married you!

03:44.080 --> 03:46.200
Ma!
I'm just saying, you know.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.880
You get married,
you forget things, you get so busy.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.480
He forgets to get flowers,
she forgets to work out.

03:51.480 --> 03:54.920
Saggy arse, pimples popping out,
teeth going bad,

03:54.920 --> 03:57.600
wrinkles popping up everywhere,
you know...

03:57.600 --> 04:02.200
Now, now, don't be so hard
on yourself. I'm sure Mr Brown
loved you anyway!

04:02.200 --> 04:05.160
Right, we'd better go.
Won't be long.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.960
Take your feckin' time!

04:09.080 --> 04:11.080
I haven't got feckin' wrinkles.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.760
Ha-ha-ha, Bono!

04:15.760 --> 04:17.840
What are you doing?

04:22.160 --> 04:24.880
Now, Bono, if you're going to
do that to Grandad,

04:24.880 --> 04:27.360
take the rubber tip off.

04:29.240 --> 04:33.040
Is he your grandad? No, he's not
my grandad, he's my husband's daddy.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.800
But I call him Grandad.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.480
Among other things...

04:37.960 --> 04:40.960
And I'm your daddy's mammy,
so you call me...

04:40.960 --> 04:44.480
Granny! That's right.
And Daddy calls me...

04:44.480 --> 04:46.960
Mammy! Yes!
And your mammy calls me...

04:46.960 --> 04:49.680
An auld cow. An auld co...

04:52.920 --> 04:54.720
Does she, now?

05:00.200 --> 05:02.480
SHE LAUGHS

05:02.480 --> 05:04.640
"Pyschic wanted.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.600
"You know where to apply."

05:10.080 --> 05:13.600
I'm ordering meself a pizza, Mammy.
Will I order you something?

05:13.600 --> 05:16.960
Give me the menu. It's in Italian.
Will I just pick something for ya?

05:16.960 --> 05:21.680
I'm well capable of ordering
for myself in any feckin' language!

05:23.360 --> 05:26.200
Hello? I'd like to order
a delivery, please.

05:27.640 --> 05:31.160
Mammy? I'm only after getting it!
Give me a feckin' second!

05:32.200 --> 05:34.000
Yes, 92 James Larkin Court.

05:35.080 --> 05:41.000
Brown. Er, a medium thin-crust
Hawaiian, please. Yeah, and, erm...

05:41.000 --> 05:43.680
I'll have the pageone!

05:43.680 --> 05:46.040
And a lasagne, please.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.000
Thanks.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.200
Excuse me. I said a pageone!

05:52.200 --> 05:54.760
That's "page one".

06:02.280 --> 06:03.720
Howya, Cathy.

06:03.720 --> 06:07.840
You still having that dream
where I'm covered in oil
and you're sliding up and down me?

06:09.160 --> 06:12.720
I've never had a dream about you.
Ah! That was my dream.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.840
Is Dermot here? No.

06:16.840 --> 06:20.440
I'll call later. If you see him, will
you say I got that thing organised?

06:20.440 --> 06:22.720
What thing? I have a friend...

06:22.720 --> 06:24.960
We don't need to know.
Good night, Buster!

06:24.960 --> 06:26.360
I'll see yous.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.960
SHE SIGHS

06:28.960 --> 06:32.160
What's up? I wish Rory and Dino
would stop fighting so much.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.200
I don't think they understand
how much it upsets other people.

06:35.200 --> 06:39.760
You could learn a lesson from that
yourself. I beg your pardon?

06:41.120 --> 06:43.960
Sorry, will you give that
to your son?

06:43.960 --> 06:46.320
I love you, Cathy. Piss off!

06:49.480 --> 06:52.240
What do you mean,
I could learn a lesson?

06:52.240 --> 06:56.840
I don't think you realise
how much you not getting on
with Mrs Nicholson upsets Maria.

06:58.760 --> 07:02.800
Here, what's in the envelope?
Two tickets for a weekend in Venice.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.800
God! Dermot's gone romance mad!
Hasn't he?

07:06.800 --> 07:10.640
Here, I've to pick me dress up
from the cleaners.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.720
Hiya, Rory. You feeling any better?

07:16.920 --> 07:18.920
HE SIGHS

07:18.920 --> 07:23.320
I got to go. Mammy, when the pizza
comes, just put it in the oven.
I won't be long. All right.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.560
Dermot's taking Maria
off to Venice for the weekend.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.680
Going to be going up and down
in their gonorrhoea.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.600
I think you mean "gorgonzola".

07:43.600 --> 07:46.120
You're right. Gorgonzola.

07:48.080 --> 07:52.280
It's in the gorgonzola.
It's the gonorrhoea that rows it.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.920
Rory, why are you so sad?

08:22.720 --> 08:26.080
Rory, I wish there was something
I could do to make things better.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.640
There's nothing. It's over!

08:29.640 --> 08:32.080
I know - I could beat him up!

08:32.080 --> 08:35.320
What?! No! I'm only joking.

08:35.320 --> 08:38.680
But you didn't want anything to
happen to him all the same, did you?

08:38.680 --> 08:41.160
See. You care. It's not over.

08:41.160 --> 08:42.720
KNOCK AT DOOR

08:42.720 --> 08:44.320
It's open!

08:45.320 --> 08:48.400
Hey, Mrs Brown.
Hello, Barbara. Sit down.

08:48.400 --> 08:52.240
How are you, Rory?
I just dropped over to see
how you are. Not there...

08:55.320 --> 08:58.080
He's not great, Barbara.
He's not great at all.

08:58.080 --> 09:02.760
I don't blame you. That Dino is
a bitchy diva at times. Wha'?

09:02.760 --> 09:05.160
DOORBELL RINGS
There's the Italian food.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.400
I don't know how
I haven't killed him before.

09:07.400 --> 09:11.000
He treats me like dirt sometimes.
Shouts at me like I'm a trainee.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.880
Well...you are a trainee!

09:15.600 --> 09:18.120
Hello, Dino! Hello, Mrs Brown.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.920
I just called round to see
if I left my white jacket here.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.360
Here, son.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.800
Dino...how are you?

09:26.800 --> 09:30.200
How am I? How am I?

09:30.200 --> 09:34.120
I haven't slept for two days.
I've a blinding headache,
bags under my eyes

09:34.120 --> 09:37.800
and last night I just curled up
in the corner and I cried
like a baby.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.480
I'm sorry I fuckin' asked now!

09:43.640 --> 09:45.160
Dino...

09:45.160 --> 09:47.920
Look, son, I know
I didn't take to you at first.

09:48.920 --> 09:52.600
And I don't pretend to know too much
about Los Homos...

09:54.720 --> 09:56.760
But I love my son.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.520
And all I ever wanted
was for Rory to be happy.

09:59.520 --> 10:04.200
And I have to say,
I've never seen Rory as happy
as he is when he's with you.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.400
HE MOUTHS

10:08.440 --> 10:10.120
SHE MOUTHS

10:12.320 --> 10:13.720
Dino...

10:13.720 --> 10:15.640
why don't you come in, son?

10:17.040 --> 10:19.040
Rory's in the kitchen.

10:19.040 --> 10:24.280
He says he cares for you
but anyone'll tell you he's always
talking about you behind your back.

10:24.280 --> 10:29.120
And who would HE be, Barbara?
The cat's mother?

10:29.120 --> 10:30.640
Hey, Dino!

10:30.640 --> 10:35.520
I was just saying that the boss
doesn't realise how good Rory...
Yous both are, wasn't I Rory?

10:35.520 --> 10:39.120
No, you weren't! You were
back-biting about the man I love!

10:39.120 --> 10:41.760
I better go, so. Yes, you better.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.560
Be in early in the morning,
Barbara.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.040
I've a new sweeping brush
for you to try out.

10:49.760 --> 10:53.360
Were you defending my honour?
Bit late for that.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.120
Oh, Rory! Ah, Dino!

10:56.120 --> 10:58.600
Oh, Jaysus!

11:01.400 --> 11:05.160
Let's start again. A new beginning.
We'll go on a date!

11:05.160 --> 11:06.320
DOORBELL RINGS

11:06.320 --> 11:09.200
There's that feckin'
Italian food now!

11:09.200 --> 11:14.360
I've a friend. He owns an indoor
horse-riding school. I'll pick you
up Thursday, seven o'clock.

11:14.360 --> 11:18.200
But I was never on a horse before.
Ach! Neither have I!
It'll be an adventure!

11:21.320 --> 11:24.280
He seemed happy.
We're going on a date!

11:29.720 --> 11:34.920
See how relieved you are now they're
not fighting? Yes. Wouldn't it be
nice if Maria could feel that way?

11:36.800 --> 11:39.680
Ring Mrs Nicholson.
I don't think so.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.440
I've dialled the number.
Speak to her!

11:47.040 --> 11:48.480
Hello, Hidley?

11:48.480 --> 11:50.800
Yes, how do do do?

11:52.440 --> 11:53.720
It's Agnes.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.480
Agnes Brown.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.880
How many fuckin' Agneses
do you know?

11:59.920 --> 12:01.440
Mammy!

12:01.440 --> 12:02.760
Sorry.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.960
No. Look, Hillary,
I was just thinking.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.920
You know, we're going to have twins
in the family.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.480
You're going to be one granny,
I'm going to be their real granny...

12:15.200 --> 12:18.880
I just thought, you know...
I'd like to take you to dinner.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.480
No, no, not here.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.880
I'll take you out.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.920
We'll go somewhere nice.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.680
We come here all the time.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.280
That's nice.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.000
Would you like some ketchup?
No, thank you.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.800
Here. Put them in your bag,
say nothing.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.080
You'll have a drink, will you?
I have a sherry.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.640
No, you'd have a DRINK, though. Mr
Foley, two pints of cider, please!

12:56.640 --> 13:00.520
You're very lucky to have
your husband at home, Mrs Nicholson.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.760
Yes, I suppose.
Mine's in hospital most of the time.

13:03.760 --> 13:07.200
Oh, I'm so sorry. Thanks, Mr Foley.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.880
Do you be gettin' it regular, now?

13:10.880 --> 13:11.920
Winnie!

13:13.080 --> 13:15.720
That's not the kind of question
you ask.

13:21.200 --> 13:25.000
Getting what?
The bonky-bonky thing!

13:27.920 --> 13:31.680
Where can one powder one's nose?
On one's face.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.000
Oh, the toilet? It's back there.

13:39.160 --> 13:42.440
BOTH: She's not getting it.
No, she's not.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.960
So, how's Sharon?
She's taking cookery lessons now.

13:46.960 --> 13:51.920
That's no harm. Do you remember
she tried to make French toast and
caught her tongue in the toaster?

13:56.040 --> 14:01.080
She made a carrot cake last night.
A carrot cake? How did it turn out?

14:01.080 --> 14:03.560
She didn't grate the carrots.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.520
What she feckin' needs is a man!
You're right, Agnes.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.640
Especially her being a virgin.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.880
Yeah!

14:17.920 --> 14:20.720
Amazing time, losing your virginity.

14:20.720 --> 14:24.520
Oh, it is! I remember it,
I remember mine. Oh, now!

14:24.520 --> 14:29.400
I was sitting there,
me mother and father downstairs
looking across from me.

14:29.400 --> 14:33.240
I gave him a nudge, I said,
"Shall we sneak upstairs?"
So we sneaked upstairs.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.640
Well, we... Hrrrr!

14:35.880 --> 14:38.280
Oh, it was such fun,
and when we finished

14:38.280 --> 14:40.280
everybody on the bus just clapped!

14:47.880 --> 14:51.080
I remember mine. Oh?

14:51.080 --> 14:54.880
Pictures first,
then home for a quiet drink.

14:54.880 --> 14:59.200
I'd left the electric blanket on
so the bed was nice and cosy.

14:59.200 --> 15:03.560
And afterwards, just lay there,
smoking me cigarette.

15:03.560 --> 15:07.200
God, I was in heaven! I can imagine.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.640
I only wish Jacko had been there!

15:16.600 --> 15:20.440
We were just talking -
how did you meet Jonathan?

15:20.440 --> 15:22.600
Well, I met him in France.

15:22.600 --> 15:26.960
Ooooh! Winnie went out with a
French man once, didn't you? I did.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.840
Really? What was his name?

15:28.840 --> 15:31.560
Creme de Monty!

15:32.760 --> 15:34.400
That's a liquor!

15:34.400 --> 15:36.160
BOTH: Do you know him?!

15:42.040 --> 15:44.200
Dermot sent Maria flowers.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.120
Where is she? What?

15:46.120 --> 15:48.640
Maria. Where did he send
the flowers to?

15:48.640 --> 15:50.000
Our house, home.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.960
But they both live there -
why didn't he bring them home
and save a few bob?

15:53.960 --> 15:55.720
You're missing the point, Winnie.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.720
It's a surprise,
the romance of it all.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.280
Ah, right.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.080
Dermot's father
wasn't like that at all.

16:02.080 --> 16:05.440
Ah, now, Agnes,
he did give you that surprise party!

16:05.440 --> 16:07.040
That was his funeral!

16:11.040 --> 16:14.240
Mr Foley! Another pint of cider
for the Queen of Sheba!

16:23.400 --> 16:27.240
Howya, Maria. Is Dermot here?

16:27.240 --> 16:29.800
No, he's still in work -
the shop's open till ten.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.400
I'll call back later
and see him. Do you have to?

16:32.400 --> 16:35.760
Do you have to call at all? What?

16:35.760 --> 16:38.520
Every time Dermot tries to
go straight you turn up,

16:38.520 --> 16:40.760
and he's back being
the master burglar.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.960
Oh, thanks very much,
it's no bother!

16:42.960 --> 16:45.760
It's not a compliment.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.280
Just leave us alone.

16:48.280 --> 16:51.680
Just go away and leave us alone!
SHE GROANS

16:51.680 --> 16:54.200
OK.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.320
AUDIENCE: Awww.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.240
Will you give that to Dermot?

16:58.240 --> 16:59.480
What is it?

16:59.480 --> 17:01.600
I knew yous two
were looking for a place

17:01.600 --> 17:04.160
and a friend of mine
just moved out of an apartment.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.280
The rent's cheap.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.280
That's the keys.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.560
Buster...

17:09.560 --> 17:11.400
Buster, look, I'm sorry.

17:11.400 --> 17:15.040
Don't mind me. My hormones
are all over the place.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.560
Do you want me
to help you look for them?

17:25.360 --> 17:27.080
Howya, Dermot! Howya, Buster!

17:27.080 --> 17:28.320
Uuurgh!

17:28.320 --> 17:30.040
Are you all right, love?

17:30.040 --> 17:31.800
She can't find her harmonica.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.960
I think the babies are coming.

17:35.960 --> 17:38.120
Jaysus! Jaysus!

17:38.120 --> 17:40.160
Get the suitcase! The suitcase!

17:40.160 --> 17:42.360
Call the ambulance! The ambulance!

17:42.360 --> 17:45.920
Breathe, in and out, in and out!

17:45.920 --> 17:47.560
Feel any better?

17:47.560 --> 17:49.400
Bit dizzy, Dermot.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.760
Not you!

17:51.760 --> 17:53.320
Yes, it's easing.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.960
Good! Dermot, you look very pale.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.200
I'm grand.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.280
Aaaargh!

17:59.280 --> 18:00.880
Oooooh...

18:03.320 --> 18:05.000
Eh...

18:05.000 --> 18:07.640
It has two bedrooms
and there's a lift that goes...

18:07.640 --> 18:09.160
Buster, go and get help!

18:09.160 --> 18:11.400
Get help, get help...

18:11.400 --> 18:13.720
HELP! HELP!

18:13.720 --> 18:17.280
Buster, will you get someone?!
Get someone. Get someone...

18:17.280 --> 18:19.840
JUST GO! I'm going!

18:19.840 --> 18:22.560
ALL: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go...

18:26.840 --> 18:28.640
ALL: Yes!

18:30.320 --> 18:32.240
The winner!

18:32.240 --> 18:34.840
Free drink for everyone!

18:34.840 --> 18:37.000
Mrs Brown, you have to go home.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
I'm having a good time, leave me
alone. No, you have to come now.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.600
Buster, I don't remember
marrying you, now piss off!

18:42.600 --> 18:44.920
They're coming! Who's coming?

18:44.920 --> 18:47.400
The babies, they're coming! Winnie!

18:47.400 --> 18:48.760
It's Maria's time!

18:48.760 --> 18:50.920
Where's Dermot? He's at your house.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.000
I think he's dead!

18:54.280 --> 18:57.360
Winnie, come on, let's go.
You, get Hillary.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.960
Where was I?

19:02.960 --> 19:04.880
Breathe, in and out...

19:04.880 --> 19:06.400
Aaaargh!

19:06.400 --> 19:08.360
Oooh...

19:09.840 --> 19:12.400
Maria, how far apart are the pains?

19:12.400 --> 19:16.160
Oh, not too far, a few minutes.
Where's Dermot?

19:16.160 --> 19:18.800
He's on the floor -
he's not able for this!

19:18.800 --> 19:21.800
Winnie, we'd better
get things started. Right, Agnes,

19:21.800 --> 19:24.560
I'll get hot water,
whisky, a lamp and newspapers.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.920
Winnie!

19:25.920 --> 19:28.520
I'm not feckin' John Wayne!

19:28.520 --> 19:30.160
Just call an ambulance!

19:31.920 --> 19:33.760
Mammy, thank God you're here!

19:33.760 --> 19:35.200
Just relax.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.120
Son, look after your wife.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.920
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

19:42.840 --> 19:46.120
Mother, are you all right?
I'm fine, thank you.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.160
Come on, I can take you!

19:48.160 --> 19:50.840
Aaargh!

19:50.840 --> 19:52.400
Ooooh...

19:52.400 --> 19:54.200
Oh, God, Maria, are you all right?

19:54.200 --> 19:56.720
She's fine, the babies are coming.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.120
The babies are...
THE BABIES ARE COMING! Calm down!

19:59.120 --> 20:00.920
THE BABIES ARE COMING! Calm down.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.760
THE BABIES ARE COMING!

20:02.760 --> 20:04.840
ECHOING THUMP

20:11.240 --> 20:13.400
ECHOING THUMP

20:19.040 --> 20:21.480
ECHOING CRACK

20:25.320 --> 20:28.400
Maria, come on, lie down.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.960
Everybody else, into the kitchen!

20:30.960 --> 20:32.760
Come on, love, lie down.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.720
Lie down, get your feet up.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.720
Remember your classes -
breathe in, breathe out...

20:38.720 --> 20:40.160
Can't see the telly!

20:40.160 --> 20:41.680
Piss off, you!

20:41.680 --> 20:43.480
Breathe in...

20:43.480 --> 20:45.160
I can't see the telly!

20:49.280 --> 20:50.720
Breathe in, breathe out...

20:50.720 --> 20:53.280
Oh, Dermot, good man,
look after your wife.

20:53.280 --> 20:55.640
What will I do?! Encourage her!

20:55.640 --> 20:57.240
Go, Maria! Go, Maria!

20:57.240 --> 20:59.800
Shut up, you moron! Aargh!

21:03.320 --> 21:05.880
Mammy, have her waters gone yet?
No, not yet!

21:05.880 --> 21:07.080
Uuurgh!

21:07.080 --> 21:09.080
WATER GUSHES

21:10.800 --> 21:12.560
Scratch that last message!

21:12.560 --> 21:14.160
Give me a towel!

21:14.160 --> 21:16.840
SIREN WAILS

21:18.960 --> 21:21.000
Oh, you're here, thank God!

21:21.000 --> 21:23.080
Maria, the ambulance is here.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.400
Everything's going to be fine!

21:25.400 --> 21:27.040
NOT HIM! HER!

21:29.480 --> 21:31.960
Not her! THIS her!

21:34.000 --> 21:35.400
Dermot, Dermot...

21:35.400 --> 21:38.840
Dermot, son,
you go in the ambulance with Maria.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.600
For God's sake,
don't you dare faint again, go!

21:41.600 --> 21:43.880
She's close, five centimetres!

21:43.880 --> 21:46.160
Aaargh!

21:46.160 --> 21:49.560
She's close, five kilometres!

21:54.040 --> 21:56.520
REPETITIVE TAPPING

22:00.240 --> 22:01.840
Buster, stop it.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.760
Sorry.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.640
I'm not able
for this feckin' waiting!

22:08.640 --> 22:12.040
Your father was great -
he was so cool.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.920
I remember when I was in on Rory.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.640
He just came in and said,
"Any news of the baby?"

22:16.640 --> 22:18.800
I said, "He's two."

22:22.520 --> 22:24.800
PHONE RINGS

22:28.440 --> 22:30.040
Hello?

22:31.600 --> 22:34.120
Kieron? Yes, hold on, he's here.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.520
Kieron, it's for you.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.120
PHONE RINGS

22:48.120 --> 22:50.360
Is that your phone? No!

22:50.360 --> 22:52.680
Of course not -
you wouldn't be silly enough

22:52.680 --> 22:54.880
to leave your phone on
in a feckin' studio!

22:57.040 --> 22:59.080
It's OUR phone!

23:04.360 --> 23:05.880
Hello?

23:07.080 --> 23:09.920
Fuck's sake, Kieron!

23:14.840 --> 23:17.400
REPETITIVE TAPPING

23:18.840 --> 23:20.960
Stop, Buster!

23:20.960 --> 23:22.800
Sorry.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.120
PHONE RINGS

23:27.680 --> 23:30.040
Hello?

23:30.040 --> 23:31.880
Dermot!

23:31.880 --> 23:33.400
Yes?

23:33.400 --> 23:34.880
Hold on.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.280
The first one was born
an hour ago - it's a boy!

23:37.280 --> 23:39.640
Yes! Yes, love.

23:39.640 --> 23:44.200
The second was born ten minutes
ago - it's another boy! Twin boys!

23:44.200 --> 23:45.720
Yes!

23:45.720 --> 23:48.160
I'm still here, love, yes.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.080
You what?

23:53.080 --> 23:54.800
Well, I...

23:57.920 --> 24:01.080
They're expecting the third
any minute now.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.360
Yes!

24:02.360 --> 24:04.800
My God,
life doesn't get better than this!

24:04.800 --> 24:06.080
Well done, Mammy!

24:06.080 --> 24:10.320
I must bring her night clothes
in the morning.
And I'll bring her flowers tomorrow.

24:10.320 --> 24:13.600
They're not her flowers. They are -
the ones you got for Dermot.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.360
I didn't get them for Dermot,
I got them for Mark.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.240
For Mark?

24:18.240 --> 24:19.560
DOOR OPENS

24:19.560 --> 24:20.960
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

24:20.960 --> 24:23.040
Oh, Rory, Rory, great news!

24:26.240 --> 24:28.160
Rory, are you all right?

24:28.160 --> 24:31.600
Ah, it's me back, Mammy,
I feel like I'm two foot tall.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.760
Did you fall? No, Mammy.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.680
Me and Dino were
up in the park, riding!

24:36.680 --> 24:40.440
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

24:45.200 --> 24:49.040
Three beautiful boys,
and they're the image of me.

24:49.040 --> 24:51.840
That'll be the trauma of the birth,
Agnes.

24:51.840 --> 24:53.440
It'll wear off.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.520
Sorry.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.840
Three beautiful new Brown boys!

24:59.840 --> 25:02.720
You won't know yourself
with babies in the house.

25:02.720 --> 25:06.760
I know! Mind you, they're
moving out shortly. I should make
the most of it while I can.

25:06.760 --> 25:07.880
Yeah.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.760
Triplets!

25:09.760 --> 25:11.800
What a way to end the series. Yeah.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.040
What? This isn't the last episode?
Yes, it is.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.800
But it can't be -
there's been no song!

25:19.800 --> 25:22.280
You're right, Winnie!

25:23.720 --> 25:24.760
We have a problem.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.600
Well, just hold on.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.960
First, I have a problem.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.800
Betty, I didn't want
to upset Maria -

25:31.800 --> 25:33.880
but I got those flowers for you.

25:33.880 --> 25:38.800
I know. And the tickets to Venice
weren't for Dermot and Maria -
I got them for us.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.480
I know.
And I'm fed up with being told...

25:41.480 --> 25:44.520
You know?
Yes, Buster told me everything.

25:44.520 --> 25:45.920
The hero again.

25:47.040 --> 25:50.120
OK, then. Fine.

25:50.120 --> 25:54.000
Sorry, Ma, what's your problem?
Well, it's much bigger than yours!

25:54.000 --> 25:57.400
This is the last programme
in the series - we've no song!

25:57.400 --> 25:59.320
I'll give you a song, Ma.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.720
Mark, love, you can't sing.
Want to bet?

26:01.720 --> 26:03.800
MUSIC: Macy Gray's "I Try"

26:03.800 --> 26:08.240
# Games, changes and fears

26:08.240 --> 26:10.520
# Where do they go from here?

26:12.040 --> 26:13.680
# When do they stop?

26:13.680 --> 26:18.960
# I believe that fate
has brought us here

26:20.600 --> 26:24.560
# And we should be together, babe

26:24.560 --> 26:26.920
# But we are not

26:28.960 --> 26:33.440
# I play it cool
but I'm thinking of you

26:34.880 --> 26:38.920
# I keep my cool, but I'm feelin'

26:38.920 --> 26:43.120
ALL: # I try to say goodbye
and I choke

26:43.120 --> 26:46.640
# Try to walk away and I stumble

26:46.640 --> 26:49.280
# Though I try to hide it, it's clear

26:49.280 --> 26:53.640
# My world crumbles
when you are not near

26:53.640 --> 26:55.720
# Goodbye and I choke

26:55.720 --> 26:58.960
# Try to walk away and I stumble

26:58.960 --> 27:01.960
# Though I try to hide it, it's clear

27:01.960 --> 27:06.040
# My world crumbles
when you are not near

27:06.040 --> 27:08.560
# Goodbye and I choke

27:08.560 --> 27:11.600
# Try to walk away and I stumble

27:11.600 --> 27:14.400
# Though I try to hide it, it's clear

27:14.400 --> 27:18.400
# My world crumbles
when you are not near. #

27:24.600 --> 27:28.200
You see?! It always works out
the way it's supposed to.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.680
Good night!

27:29.680 --> 27:31.200
One more time!

27:33.320 --> 27:36.680
# I try to say goodbye and I choke

27:36.680 --> 27:39.760
# Try to walk away and I stumble

27:39.760 --> 27:43.320
# Though I try to hide it, it's clear

27:43.320 --> 27:46.920
# My world crumbles
when you are not near

27:46.920 --> 27:50.040
# Goodbye and I choke

27:50.040 --> 27:53.160
# Try to walk away and I stumble

27:53.160 --> 27:56.200
# Though I try to hide it, it's clear

27:56.200 --> 28:00.600
# My world crumbles
when you are not near. #

28:08.280 --> 28:09.960
That's nice!
