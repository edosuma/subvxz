02:15.200 --> 02:17.156
All right, l've had it.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.113
l'm sick of coming home,
seeing you holding down the couch...

02:20.320 --> 02:22.993
...watching Oprah
and stuffing your face full of bonbons.

02:23.240 --> 02:28.360
Now, you either get your lazy ass in the
kitchen and cook me a meal or get out.

02:32.760 --> 02:36.275
Come on, Al, Marcie won't let me back
in the house until l have a job.

02:36.520 --> 02:40.559
lf you kick me out too,
where will l go?

02:41.280 --> 02:43.191
Don't know, don't care.

02:43.880 --> 02:47.714
Sure, you working people don't know
how tough it is to find a job these days.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.354
Kelly, l got you another job.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.516
Damn, l'm a good agent.

03:02.760 --> 03:06.196
lf l was a hot young chick,
l couldn't keep my hands off myself.

03:07.160 --> 03:10.436
Well, l guess that makes you
a hot young chick.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.440
Just for that, l'm not gonna tell you
who got the part...

03:15.640 --> 03:17.471
...in the next Romantic Roast
commercial.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.629
Oh, please, Bud, please tell me.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.434
Well, she's blond.
She's standing right next to me...

03:24.640 --> 03:27.598
...and she doesn't have a brain
in her head.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.753
Could you be
a little bit more specific?

03:32.800 --> 03:35.234
-You, you dullard.
-What?

03:35.480 --> 03:38.119
-l got the job? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-You got the job.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.117
All l did was read lines
at the audition.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.550
l mean, l didn't even have to
uncross my--

03:45.440 --> 03:47.715
My fingers or anything.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.469
Look, you start shooting tonight.

03:50.720 --> 03:54.156
Congratulations, pumpkin.
But what exactly is Romantic Roast?

03:54.400 --> 03:57.119
lt's this brown powder stuff
that when you add hot water...

03:57.320 --> 03:59.117
...it becomes coffee.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.318
l know. l know, l didn't believe it either,
but it's true.

04:04.560 --> 04:08.075
That settles it. lf someone with
the lQ of a french fry can get a job...

04:08.280 --> 04:09.952
...you can too.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.113
Yeah.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.351
Wait-- Hey.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.238
Now, listen, Jefferson.

04:16.480 --> 04:19.199
l also want you to drive these kids
anywhere they wanna go.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.158
You want me to be a chauffeur?

04:21.360 --> 04:22.588
That's humiliating.

04:22.840 --> 04:26.879
No, Jefferson, sleeping
in Peg's couch dust is humiliating.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.112
This is just a job
so Marcie will take you back.

04:30.360 --> 04:35.150
Look, l appreciate that, Al,
but l can't take money from your kids.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.749
Sure you can.
You're stronger than the boy.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.592
Just shake him down
when the girl's not looking.

04:45.960 --> 04:50.033
Okay, folks,
Romantic Roast commercial, take one.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.916
Yep, Lance, the really cute
building super, is on his way up...

04:55.120 --> 04:58.954
...so l've cleverly jammed
the disposal.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.959
Yep, l put ABBA's greatest hits
on the stereo...

05:05.160 --> 05:10.234
...and, well, of course,
l made two cups of Romantic Roast.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.552
l'll let you know how it goes.
Okay, bye.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.879
l'm here to fix the disposal.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.633
Cut.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.431
Very amusing Mike Tyson
impression.

05:32.240 --> 05:37.360
This time, could you try it in a register
everyone can hear, not just dogs?

05:38.800 --> 05:42.429
And of course,
l made two cups of Romantic Roast.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.638
l'll let you know how it goes. Bye.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.469
l'm here to fix the disposal.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.119
Cut.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.272
l'm curious.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.830
Exactly what part on Baywatch
did you play?

06:08.800 --> 06:11.917
Well, the voice of Lex,
the friendly dolphin.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.036
All right, Lex, you're fired.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.750
Okay. Let's just call it a day,
shall we?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.558
Bite me.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.876
Mr. Director...

06:25.920 --> 06:27.797
...look, l think l know
who can play Lance.

06:28.040 --> 06:32.556
Oh, l don't think you're right
for the part. You look like he sounds.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.798
l heard that.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.188
Not me.
l'm talking about my other client.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.399
Yeah, and put 50 bucks
on Agile Angus to place.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.073
Yeah.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.198
Mr. D'Arcy, l think l can get you a job
in this commercial.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.914
Why? What have l ever done to you?

06:52.720 --> 06:55.553
lt's a job so Mrs. D'Arcy
will let you back in the house.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.472
Hey, yeah. Maybe you're right.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.508
l mean, you know,
it's not really work.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.396
lt's acting.

07:07.680 --> 07:13.073
And of course,
I made two cups of Romantic Roast.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.836
Okay. I'll let you know
how it goes. Bye.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.831
I'm here to fix the disposal.

07:23.240 --> 07:26.118
You know, I can't figure out
what happened.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.589
I see this all the time.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.110
Can I thank you
with a cup of coffee?

07:45.960 --> 07:47.279
Romantic Roast?

07:48.080 --> 07:50.036
Romantic Roast.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.871
Long after the coffee's gone...

07:56.120 --> 07:58.759
... the romance lingers on and on.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.356
Romantic Roast.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.113
Congratulations, pumpkin.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.476
As you know,
acting careers are fleeting.

08:06.680 --> 08:10.593
So you should give me your money
so l can invest it wisely for you.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.509
Oh, Daddy, you do love me.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.318
l do now.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.394
This commercial is the best thing
that happened to us.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.710
Well, for once, Al, we agree.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.953
With Jefferson employed,
our relationship has never been better.

08:29.920 --> 08:34.232
There he is. lt's Lance,
Mr. Romantic-Roast-Coffee-Guy.

08:37.720 --> 08:43.669
Excuse me. Excuse me. But you know,
l'm Mrs. Romantic-Roast-Coffee-Guy.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.791
Only on TV.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.271
l'm the real
Mrs. Romantic-Roast-Coffee-Guy.

08:52.560 --> 08:55.518
Oh, you're his mother.

08:58.160 --> 09:01.630
No, you twit. l'm his wife.

09:01.880 --> 09:05.634
That's impossible. This map to
the star's homes says he lives alone.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.871
Give me that.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.513
What lowlife would sell you this?

09:13.200 --> 09:15.760
Two hundred seventy-five, 300...

09:16.320 --> 09:17.594
...350.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.636
Al, you've got to do something...

09:22.840 --> 09:25.718
...about this ruthless exploitation
of our families.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.239
You're right, and l will.

09:30.840 --> 09:31.909
There you go.

09:32.120 --> 09:36.432
May l present
the autographed Lance pump.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.110
Price: 79.95.

09:40.760 --> 09:44.435
Price Gary thinks
we're selling it for: 9.95.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.834
Let the purse-jacking begin.

09:58.680 --> 10:02.559
Ma'am, groping Lance
will cost you 1 00 bucks.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.148
Grope on.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.437
Jefferson?

10:13.120 --> 10:15.953
-There you are.
-How did you find me here?

10:16.240 --> 10:17.468
Bud was also selling maps...

10:17.680 --> 10:21.309
...to ''where the stars are making
whorish public appearances.''

10:21.600 --> 10:25.991
Did you know that Michael Cane is
down at Orange Julius as we speak?

10:26.240 --> 10:27.958
Why would you sell
your good name...

10:28.160 --> 10:30.833
...to line the polyester pockets
of the lowest man on earth?

10:31.080 --> 10:34.390
And you wonder
why stars leave their wives.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.518
Look, Marcie,
this is all harmless fun.

10:38.760 --> 10:41.194
This is just Jefferson's
1 5 minutes of fame.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.115
Yeah, it will be over
before your hair grows out.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.670
Mr. D'Arcy, great news.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.992
The people from Romantic Roast called
and they want you and Kelly...

10:52.200 --> 10:54.236
-...for two more commercials.
-Hey, no way!

11:00.840 --> 11:03.638
Lance, why don't you finish
your Romantic Roast...

11:03.840 --> 11:06.798
... while it's still hot and steamy.

11:09.120 --> 11:14.148
Lila, that's not the only thing
that's hot and steamy.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.552
Oh, Lance.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.395
Oh, Lila.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.749
Oh, shoot me.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.192
Romantic Roast,
what Juan Valdez drinks...

11:32.400 --> 11:34.994
... when the missus is out of town.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.509
Al, don't you see where this is going?
Jefferson is getting famous...

11:40.720 --> 11:42.915
...and more women
are throwing themselves at him.

11:43.120 --> 11:46.317
He'll be gone. l'll be all alone.
lt will be just like when Steve left.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.114
lt's a very scary thing.
Do you understand?

11:50.880 --> 11:56.432
Yes, l do, Marcie, and to help you out,
l made a top 1 0 list of things...

11:56.640 --> 11:59.552
...to make you more attractive
for your--

12:00.560 --> 12:03.279
For your sex-symbol husband.

12:06.880 --> 12:12.716
Number 1 0, wear traditional lslamic
garb, covering all but the eyes.

12:13.760 --> 12:18.072
Number nine,
feather-removing electrolysis.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.400
Number eight, ski mask.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.594
Number seven,
sew up holes in ski mask.

12:26.360 --> 12:31.309
Number six, hire attractive woman
to stand in front of you at all times.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.836
Number five, beak job.

12:35.240 --> 12:39.279
Number four,
put paper bag over ski mask.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.352
Number three, shave head...

12:41.560 --> 12:44.711
...tattoo Cindy Crawford's face
on back of head...

12:45.600 --> 12:48.672
...learn to walk backwards.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.879
Number two, poke out eyes
of every man on earth.

12:58.680 --> 13:03.310
Number one, get president
to make every day Halloween.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.116
Yeah, l don't understand you, Al.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.072
Although perhaps that's the fault...

13:13.280 --> 13:17.239
...of that cow-sized tongue
inside your peanut-sized head.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.514
Hey, do l make fun of you?

13:25.440 --> 13:29.069
Doesn't it bother you
that your daughter and my husband...

13:29.280 --> 13:31.316
...are living a soap opera romance?

13:31.560 --> 13:32.788
No, Marcie.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.355
But the difference
between me and you, Marcie...

13:35.600 --> 13:39.673
...outside the fact that my feet
aren't a Chinese delicacy...

13:40.560 --> 13:43.552
...is that l know the difference
between fact and fiction.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.836
Well, l'm glad you feel that way, Dad.

13:46.040 --> 13:49.749
Because l was worried you might have
a problem with this next commercial.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.959
-Why? What's in this commercial?
-Well, Mr. D'Arcy and Kelly have to--

13:54.200 --> 13:56.589
-They have to kiss.
-What?

13:57.360 --> 13:59.351
l'll kill him first.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.479
Dad, it's only a commercial. One
that's gonna make us a lot of money.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.995
Bud, there's some things
more important than money.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.476
Kelly's lips are never gonna go
where Marcie's lips have been.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.756
Yeah? Well, my Jefferson's lips
are never gonna go...

14:16.960 --> 14:19.428
...where everyone else's lips
have already been.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.912
That's right!

14:23.440 --> 14:25.670
Hey, what are you hinting at?

14:26.120 --> 14:28.998
l'll break it to you later.
Now let's deal with this situation.

14:29.200 --> 14:32.317
Oh, well, what are we worried about?
Kelly will never go for this.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.112
Hey, did you hear the good news?

14:38.640 --> 14:41.916
We're gonna kiss on television.

14:46.720 --> 14:50.679
Jefferson, honey,
can l have a word with you...

14:50.880 --> 14:55.192
...in our own kitchen
by the recently sharpened knives?

14:56.560 --> 14:59.950
-Goodbye, Lila.
-Bye, Lance.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.390
Kelly, we have to have a talk.

15:04.640 --> 15:08.030
As her agent, l strongly advise
my client not to listen to you.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.312
Shut up or it's five across the eyes.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.915
Kelly, l've given you
good fatherly advice in the past.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.720
Daddy, you have never given me
fatherly advice.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.599
Then here's some advice
from someone 1 00 pounds heavier...

15:21.800 --> 15:25.509
...with an eight-inch reach advantage.
You are not kissing the neighbour.

15:25.760 --> 15:29.469
Daddy, l am grown up. And you can't
tell me what to do anymore, so:

15:29.720 --> 15:33.156
Kelly, l know you're grown up
even though you still live at home...

15:33.400 --> 15:36.517
...and occasionally pick up the phone
thinking it's the doorbell...

15:37.120 --> 15:38.348
...but, sweetheart, look.

15:38.560 --> 15:42.633
Why do you think l carry
your baby picture in my wallet?

15:42.880 --> 15:44.871
That's not me, Dad.

15:45.560 --> 15:48.233
That's the picture
that came with the wallet.

15:48.480 --> 15:52.234
Hey, when l bought this wallet, l had
a choice. A little boy or a little girl.

15:52.440 --> 15:57.355
-l picked a little girl. She's symbolic.
-She's Chinese, Dad.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.237
That's what l was hoping
you would be.

16:02.680 --> 16:06.719
Daddy, l'm sorry l'm not Chinese.
l didn't mean it.

16:06.920 --> 16:10.230
Oh, sweetheart, all right.
That's all right, now.

16:12.280 --> 16:14.555
Daddy, what is really the problem?

16:14.800 --> 16:18.395
Well, because
l wanna keep you pure.

16:22.560 --> 16:27.588
Well, we better call Mr. Peabody
and the WABAC machine.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.479
Daddy.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.915
This commercial is just pretend.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.436
And of course l'm gonna stay pure
until l meet the right man.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.033
ln the meantime, why don't you
come to the set tomorrow...

16:44.240 --> 16:46.037
...and you'll see how innocent it is.

16:46.280 --> 16:49.033
And if you don't like what you see,
you know what you can do.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.231
Beat everybody up?

16:53.480 --> 16:54.993
You are my daddy.

16:59.360 --> 17:02.193
Actors on the set for the reading.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.675
So, what kind of kiss
do you think it will be?

17:04.880 --> 17:06.711
There's only one kind.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.757
Man faces woman, closes his eyes...

17:08.960 --> 17:11.713
...imagines he's with someone else,
just like sex.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.358
You truly are a Neanderthal.

17:15.599 --> 17:19.832
l mean, there's all kinds of kisses.
Open mouth, closed mouth, tongues.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.672
Tongues?

17:22.160 --> 17:25.550
The tongue has no place in passion.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.589
Hey, excuse me, Mr. Director.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.593
l'd like to talk to you
about this kissing with tongues.

17:32.840 --> 17:36.310
Wrong set. They're casting
Show Boys down the hall.

17:36.560 --> 17:41.236
No, no. Kelly's my daughter. l wanna
make sure this kiss is quick and clean.

17:41.480 --> 17:44.631
Oh, well, they're not going to kiss
anymore. We did some research...

17:44.840 --> 17:49.072
...and the audience felt that kissing
after the third date was too '80s.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.069
l'm glad this country
has finally come to its senses.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.157
So, what are you gonna
have them do?

18:02.880 --> 18:04.757
What's that bed for?

18:05.520 --> 18:07.715
Oh, come on, Mr. Bundy.
You're a married man.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.393
Yeah?

18:11.120 --> 18:12.917
What's that bed for?

18:14.040 --> 18:16.634
We, in the business, call it sex.

18:16.880 --> 18:19.792
l don't care what you call it.
My daughter's not doing it.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.790
Mr. Bundy,
they're not really having sex.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.278
ln fact, the commercial takes place
after sex, when they're having coffee.

18:29.200 --> 18:33.512
How can someone drink coffee
in their sleep?

18:41.520 --> 18:45.035
l'll handle this, Magilla. Look...

18:45.920 --> 18:51.438
...my husband is not having
postcoital coffee with anyone.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.272
l don't care how much you pay him.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.796
How does $50,000 sound?

18:56.560 --> 18:58.710
Quiet on the set.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.478
-Dad, did you hear that?
-l just still can't figure it out.

19:02.680 --> 19:05.752
Sex, then coffee. lt's just wrong.

19:07.760 --> 19:10.957
Okay, l know you just got
these new lines.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.236
So we're gonna have
a cold reading on set...

19:13.440 --> 19:14.668
...and see what we've got.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.110
Good morning, darling.

19:22.360 --> 19:26.319
Wow, Lance,
you sure fixed the squeak in my bed.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.917
You're wonderful.

19:29.160 --> 19:32.709
So the sex
was good for you too, huh?

19:32.960 --> 19:35.190
No, it was awful...

19:35.480 --> 19:39.155
...but the coffee
makes it all worthwhile.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.512
Then you sip, and then you smile
and then we're done.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.318
Great. How do those lines feel?

19:45.800 --> 19:47.995
-Brilliant.
-Encore.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.949
Problem over here. Look.

19:51.200 --> 19:56.433
What exactly does she mean,
'' lt was awful''?

19:56.800 --> 19:59.030
-She means you're bad in bed.
-l am not.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.350
Okay, Lance is bad in bed.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.473
You don't seem to understand.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.319
To millions of women out there,
l am Lance.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.915
Okay? l can't have them thinking
that l'm bad in bed.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.839
Now, how about if l'm good,
and she's bad?

20:12.080 --> 20:14.196
That's the way it is in real life.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.148
You're gonna have to
rewrite this script, pal.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.472
We can't do that. See, this commercial
is geared towards women...

20:28.680 --> 20:31.956
...and we all know
they can never be satisfied.

20:33.240 --> 20:35.356
-That's true.
-That's true.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.313
Which works for us. Because if men
really were good in bed...

20:39.520 --> 20:42.318
...women wouldn't need
flavoured coffee.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.758
Look, pal, l'm a real man...

20:47.000 --> 20:51.039
...and l can't pretend
to be anything less.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.950
Marcie, could l have a ride home?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.833
Take the bus
with the other real men.

21:03.600 --> 21:07.878
Wait, Mr. D'Arcy. This happens
to older married men all the time.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.030
l've-- l've heard.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.070
Well, that's a wrap.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.353
Actors.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.478
Maybe we should rethink
this whole campaign.

21:21.720 --> 21:23.153
l've got it.

21:23.400 --> 21:27.996
Frogs. Coffee-drinking frogs.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.872
Mr. Director, listen.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.190
Before you go with frogs,
hear me out.

21:33.680 --> 21:34.999
Action.

21:35.240 --> 21:40.598
Wow, Vance, you fixed the squeak
in my bed. You're wonderful.

21:44.400 --> 21:48.393
So the sex was--
What? What's the line?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.153
Good for you.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.710
So the sex was good for you?

21:54.800 --> 21:56.677
No, it was awful.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.838
But that's what makes the coffee
all worthwhile.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.595
Cut. Cut.

22:04.280 --> 22:09.638
So the sex was good
for you too, huh?

22:11.120 --> 22:15.557
No, it was awful.

22:16.320 --> 22:19.949
Cut. Cut.
Thank you. That's enough.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.316
l'm going home. Someone get me
some frogs and some bourbon.

22:40.160 --> 22:45.871
So the sex was good for you too?

22:47.400 --> 22:49.595
No, it was awful.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.315
But that's what makes the coffee
all worthwhile.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.509
Hey, how was that?

22:58.280 --> 22:59.952
Great.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.236
Let's try it again, Al.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.557
So the sex was good for you too?

23:06.800 --> 23:08.711
No, it was awful.

23:08.920 --> 23:12.356
But that's what makes the coffee
all worthwhile.

23:12.880 --> 23:16.156
Well, that was good for me.
Was that good for you, Al?
