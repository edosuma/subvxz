40:08.364 --> 40:09.832
I have to tell you something.

40:14.829 --> 40:15.830
What?

40:19.292 --> 40:20.669
What if I told you
we could make it

40:20.752 --> 40:22.299
like none of this
everhappened?

No, not just that.

I mean, everything.

Including what happened
to our parents.

If we could take it all
back, from the beginning,

40:43.983 --> 40:46.577
what would you be willing
to sacrifice for that?

40:48.488 --> 40:50.365
Angela,
what you're talking about,

40:52.700 --> 40:54.202
that's not possible.

H ow?

41:09.008 --> 41:10.055
Never mind.

41:15.056 --> 41:17.479
I'm just tired.
I think I should go to bed.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.739
Can you stay here
tonight?

41:29.070 --> 41:30.947
It's been a rough
couple of months.

It's me.

42:34.761 --> 42:35.808
Come closer.

43:08.753 --> 43:10.426
I need to get dressed.

And then we'll go.

That's been taken care of.

43:40.868 --> 43:43.462
We need to pick up Darlene.
She should be a part of this.

43:43.579 --> 43:44.626
ANGELA: No.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.750
In fact, you need to stay
away from her.

43:47.375 --> 43:48.592
We can't trust her.

43:48.668 --> 43:50.386
She helped Elliot
close the backdoor.

43:51.045 --> 43:52.092
Come again?

43:54.674 --> 43:55.721
She did What?

Yes.

so calm about this?

We're going to find a way
to get back on the network.

Is that all?
We'll be fine.

44:11.190 --> 44:13.238
This isn't about the backdoor.
It's about him.

44:13.568 --> 44:15.696
Anything we do,
he will try to slow us down.

44:15.778 --> 44:18.622
As long as he exists,
he will stop us.

44:20.449 --> 44:24.044

to redirect his energy.

In case Elliot comes back.

44:44.849 --> 44:46.066
How can you tell?

44:47.685 --> 44:48.777
That it's me?

44:50.813 --> 44:53.236

not talking to him right now?

45:18.424 --> 45:19.550
When I saw him
earlier tonight,

45:19.634 --> 45:21.807
he was all hell-bent
on not doing this.

45:21.886 --> 45:23.138
How'd you change his mind?

45:24.639 --> 45:25.891

remember, he woke up

45:25.973 --> 45:28.192

in his stomach.

45:41.989 --> 45:43.957
he was looking at me
like we'd never met.

45:45.910 --> 45:47.708
You brought me in
to manage him.

45:48.329 --> 45:49.706
And that's exactly
what I've done.

45:49.789 --> 45:51.166

does it?

for getting me the time

45:57.672 --> 45:58.889
before checking in with her.

Don't thank me too quickly.

We're behind schedule now, and we both
know how she feels about punctuality.

46:04.804 --> 46:05.851
One more thing.

46:07.974 --> 46:09.726
I'm going to get him
a job at Evil Corp.

46:11.769 --> 46:14.397
Doesn't hurt to have him on the
inside, given our situation.

better aim, though.

I'm not going to talk to you

You and I,
we are not friends.

It's precisely
that you're besties with him

48:58.853 --> 49:02.574
that I'm trying to understand how
you can lie to him so blatantly.

right at him.

way to get out of this.

of Elliot's

What it is that I do,

we're going to have
to trust each other.

one more time.

Why,exacfly,
are you doing all of this?

Evil Corp killed my mom.

50:29.610 --> 50:31.112
And my whole life...

50:36.075 --> 50:40.797
I've always wanted justice
for her death.

justice to a

as untouchable as Evil Corp?

about your crazy plan,

it was possible.

It wasn't until
she opened my eyes

51:42.182 --> 51:44.310
all of the damage
that they've caused
