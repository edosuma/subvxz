spread to other people.

that their lungs imploded, too?

all out on the road.

No, but apparently, Mrs. Nunis here
nearly ran over Vince and Dave

13:26.556 --> 13:28.888
moments before
the pressure began.

13:29.017 --> 13:33.556

27:00.578 --> 27:03.411
So why even bother trying?

27:04.499 --> 27:06.410
[Cell phone rings]

27:09.796 --> 27:12.253
Damn it.
Nathan, stop calling me.

27:12.381 --> 27:14.713
Duke, it's Jack.
We found Aiden.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.833
Come talk to me.

27:23.476 --> 27:24.636
No.

27:25.603 --> 27:28.561
Look what's happening out there,
Duke. We can stop this.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.313
I said, "no".

27:32.193 --> 27:34.730
Hey, Duke, I don't love the idea,
but we ——

27:34.862 --> 27:36.477
Who are you to talk?

27:37.573 --> 27:40.280
That man is willing to die
to end one trouble,

27:40.409 --> 27:41.865
while you ——

27:41.994 --> 27:45.031
you decided that your life is worth
more than all of the troubles.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.449
—So don't.
—Hey.

27:47.250 --> 27:49.241
—[ Grunts]
—[ Gasps]

28:03.683 --> 28:05.639
Your trouble's gone.

28:07.895 --> 28:08.975
How?

28:22.577 --> 28:24.158
We cleared the ambulatory patients,

28:24.287 --> 28:27.074
but moving the bed-bound is going
to take more time than we have.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.867
Well, do whatever it takes.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.709
I don't want anyone near the hospital
when that generator blows.

28:33.921 --> 28:37.584
This pressure bubble is
over 1/4 mile across now.

28:37.717 --> 28:39.582
I thought it would have
some kind of natural ending point,

28:39.719 --> 28:41.050
but it just keeps growing.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.918
Bodies are gonna start piling up.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.760
Or you could kill me.

28:49.562 --> 28:50.597
No.

28:50.730 --> 28:51.594
Hey, guys.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.813
I've looked everywhere for Duke.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.181
I can't believe he abandoned Haven.

28:55.318 --> 28:57.183
Whatever cruel god
gave us the troubles,

28:57.320 --> 29:00.232
they designed the Crocker curse
exactly for this situation.

29:00.364 --> 29:02.616
Duke's not an option.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.528
We need another solution.

29:04.702 --> 29:07.614
We need a deep—sea pressure suit,
but I don't know where to find one.

29:12.168 --> 29:13.908
I do.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.213
Okay.

29:27.350 --> 29:28.635
—Ready?
—Yeah.

29:31.020 --> 29:33.306
Don't worry, I'll be operating
your suit from here.

29:36.192 --> 29:38.808
—Where'd you get these?
—Ah, I know a guy.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.401
—You sure they'll work?
—Hope so.

29:40.529 --> 29:43.441
—|'ve never worn one.
—AUDREY: I went snorkeling once.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.783
It's hard to move.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.781
They're made for the bottom
of the ocean.

29:59.090 --> 30:01.001
You should be getting
in the pressure zone now.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.509
Yup.

30:04.762 --> 30:06.423
Should we check on that guy?

30:06.555 --> 30:08.341
At this pressure,
he's already dead.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.858
We're in deep now.

30:23.489 --> 30:24.945
Not funny.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.369
Wuornos, this is topside.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.120
I'm seeing turbulence in your air.

30:41.257 --> 30:42.337
Check your line.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.680
Wuornos, I lost your reading.

30:48.806 --> 30:50.296
My line's leaking.

30:50.433 --> 30:51.593
I can't breathe.

30:52.643 --> 30:54.019
Get him out of there.

30:54.145 --> 30:55.385
l'm pullin' him out.

30:57.314 --> 30:59.145
—[ Groans]
—Come on, Nathan.

30:59.275 --> 31:01.561
[Gasping]

31:01.694 --> 31:03.605
I can't breathe.

31:03.738 --> 31:06.650
I can't take your helmet off, either.
So let's get out of here.

31:07.742 --> 31:09.482
Audrey, go on.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.700
—But Nathan ——
—I can help Nathan.

31:11.829 --> 31:13.990
You have to get Aiden to stop this.

31:14.123 --> 31:15.203
Go.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.585
Go! We don't have a lot of time.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.952
NATHAN:
I can't breathe. I need air.

31:22.089 --> 31:24.626
DUKE:
Come on, you can make it.

31:41.150 --> 31:42.765
Come on, Nathan,
a little bit further

31:42.902 --> 31:44.733
and we'll be outside
the pressure bubble.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.081
[Coughing]

31:56.207 --> 31:57.287
I know you're chokin', buddy,

31:57.416 --> 31:59.577
but you take that helmet off here
and you're dead.

32:04.340 --> 32:05.955
Jack?

32:06.884 --> 32:09.546
Aiden, I'm here to help.

32:09.678 --> 32:10.838
How can you help?

32:10.971 --> 32:13.553
—|'m doing this.
—|t's true.

32:13.682 --> 32:17.425
You have a trouble,
but you know what else you have?

32:17.561 --> 32:20.177
You have a brother and a wife,

32:20.314 --> 32:23.021
and they need you
to stop this trouble.

32:23.150 --> 32:24.936
My friend is running out of air
right now.

32:25.069 --> 32:28.812
So listen to me,
and I can help you.

32:28.948 --> 32:30.358
10 more feet.
Come on.

32:30.491 --> 32:34.075
I heard you and your wife,
you got some good news recently.

32:34.203 --> 32:36.319
Come on, Nathan.
We're almost there.

32:36.956 --> 32:38.571
We're gonna have a baby.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.572
But what does that have to do
with this?

32:40.709 --> 32:42.165
Well, that baby?

32:42.294 --> 32:45.411
That baby needs you
to learn to control this.

32:45.548 --> 32:48.255
I don't get it.
A Driscoll can't have a trouble.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.337
Okay, Nathan,
we're outside the pressure.

32:51.971 --> 32:55.964
Nathan!
Just hold on a few more seconds!

32:57.476 --> 33:00.434
Some truths are hard to accept,
but we have to accept them,

33:00.563 --> 33:02.804
or we hurt the people we love,

33:02.940 --> 33:05.647
the ones who need us
to do it for them.

33:05.776 --> 33:07.312
NATHAN: I can't breathe.

33:07.444 --> 33:08.980
DUKE: Nathan, hang in there.

33:09.155 --> 33:10.861
What do l have to do?

33:10.990 --> 33:16.735
You have to focus and just
breathe slowly to calm yourself,

33:16.871 --> 33:20.534
the same technique
you learned as a diver.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.202
You can do it.

33:24.587 --> 33:26.168
[Exhales]

33:30.426 --> 33:33.259
[Gasps, coughs]

33:36.307 --> 33:38.138
Good.

33:45.441 --> 33:46.772
It's working.

33:46.901 --> 33:48.186
You did it.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.484
[Panting]

34:01.207 --> 34:03.072
[Sighs]
Yeah.

34:10.674 --> 34:12.335
Your trouble's gone.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.377
Did you kill Wade?

34:18.891 --> 34:21.052
I didn't have a choice.

34:23.103 --> 34:25.230
What you said before...

34:27.274 --> 34:30.141
Do you really think
Audrey should kill me?

34:31.487 --> 34:34.775
How I feel about Audrey...

34:34.907 --> 34:35.896
[Sighs]

34:36.033 --> 34:37.523
...it's complicated.

34:39.328 --> 34:41.489
But no.

34:42.373 --> 34:44.364
l was angry.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.284
I mean, I'm selfish,
but I'm not that selfish.

34:49.213 --> 34:51.078
That's funny.

34:51.215 --> 34:54.548
In so many ways, you're
the least selfish person I know.

34:54.677 --> 34:58.920
Funny, that's the second time
I've heard that today.

35:01.350 --> 35:02.635
Who else said it?

35:02.768 --> 35:05.475
Someone a lot cuter than you.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.642
First, you tell me to pack up
and move out

35:09.775 --> 35:11.811
when you get
your precious bilge pump.

35:11.944 --> 35:13.935
And then you call me,
"Bring your things back."

35:14.071 --> 35:17.563
God, make up your mind,
businessman.

35:25.082 --> 35:27.289
Hi.
[Clears throat]

35:48.063 --> 35:50.224
NATHAN:
I can't stop thinking about it.

35:51.108 --> 35:54.350
It's like you said to Aiden...

35:54.486 --> 35:59.822
some truths are hard to accept,
but people need us to do it for them.

36:00.576 --> 36:02.988
Haven needs us to do this.

36:03.162 --> 36:06.029
I can't believe
we're actually talking about this.

36:06.165 --> 36:11.660
Jack Driscoll wanted to sacrifice
himself to end one trouble.

36:13.464 --> 36:15.000
My death ends 'em all.

36:21.180 --> 36:24.513
How can we walk away
from something like that?

36:27.186 --> 36:29.347
Especially now
that someone's altering the rules,

36:29.480 --> 36:32.847
putting troubles in families
that never had them.

36:34.068 --> 36:35.558
You know what that means, right?

36:35.694 --> 36:38.527
It means it's getting worse.

36:38.655 --> 36:41.146
Then how lucky are we

36:41.283 --> 36:45.196
that we can make
everything better...

36:46.872 --> 36:48.408
...with one bullet?

36:55.964 --> 36:59.957
You're supposed to help people
with their troubles.

37:00.094 --> 37:02.710
You're meant to do it karmically,
remember?

37:06.016 --> 37:09.053
What better way
than to cure them all forever?

37:19.655 --> 37:21.941
Mind if I bring your stuff back?

37:22.074 --> 37:24.656
Thank you.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.783
I'm an idiot.

37:44.805 --> 37:46.466
What's all this?

37:46.598 --> 37:50.682
lt belonged
to my biological parents.

37:50.811 --> 37:51.721
I went to their old house,

37:51.854 --> 37:54.186
but it turns out they moved away
a long time ago.

37:54.314 --> 37:57.272
The new owner gave me the stuff
they left in the attic.

37:58.152 --> 37:58.982
[Laughs]

37:59.111 --> 38:01.227
—O|d family treasures?
—[Laughs]

38:01.363 --> 38:03.945
No. Just old junk.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.115
Jennifer?

38:07.995 --> 38:09.576
—Jennifer.
—Oh, my God.

38:09.705 --> 38:10.490
[Clears throat]

38:10.622 --> 38:11.828
No,no,no,no,no.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.414
Come on in, you're not
interrupting anything.

38:14.543 --> 38:17.205
Sorry, Duke.
Did you find your parents?

38:17.337 --> 38:18.793
Oh, don't start with that, Dave.

38:18.922 --> 38:20.753
Start with,
"Sorry we abandoned you."

38:20.883 --> 38:22.464
You've just had a big day.

38:22.593 --> 38:24.333
Sorry we got sidetracked.

38:24.470 --> 38:27.086
Oh, Dave got you to read
whatever that is.

38:27.222 --> 38:30.931
This is the handwritten journal
of the explorer Sebastian Cabot,

38:31.059 --> 38:35.098
who spent the winter here in 1497
with the local Mi'kmaq Indians.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.482
Yeah ——
Oh, it's a fascinating account.

38:37.608 --> 38:39.189
DUKE: I'm sure it is.
Get out.

38:39.318 --> 38:40.433
Much of what he writes is accurate

38:40.569 --> 38:42.651
to the troubles
as we know them today.

38:42.779 --> 38:46.067
Cabot records
an ancient Mi'kmaq legend,

38:46.200 --> 38:50.944
a time they considered the blackest
in their long history.

38:51.079 --> 38:53.821
A time of great evil and suffering

38:53.957 --> 38:57.620
that started when someone opened
an otherworldly door

38:57.753 --> 38:59.459
that shouldn't have been opened.

38:59.588 --> 39:01.544
The door that Lexie came through.

39:01.673 --> 39:02.833
—You tried to stop it.
—Yeah.

39:02.966 --> 39:06.424
And you thought
that when the Driscolls got troubled,

39:06.553 --> 39:10.011
that this evil had come back.

39:10.140 --> 39:14.179
I did, but for once,
I can say I'm thrilled to be wrong.

39:14.311 --> 39:15.551
Well, mark your calendar.

39:15.687 --> 39:16.972
How do you know you're wrong?

39:17.105 --> 39:20.313
According to the legend,
the great evil

39:20.442 --> 39:23.809
has specific harbingers
we haven't seen...

39:23.946 --> 39:24.901
Mm.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.237
Horseshoe crabs with human eyes.

39:27.366 --> 39:28.526
[Both laugh]

39:28.659 --> 39:30.650
Um...

39:30.786 --> 39:33.118
I've seen them.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.541
What?

39:39.002 --> 39:42.039
Think of how many people
died today.

39:43.423 --> 39:47.666
Jill Nunis was married to Roger
for 20 years.

39:47.803 --> 39:50.089
They loved each other,

39:50.222 --> 39:53.214
just like us.

39:53.350 --> 39:56.387
How can I go on living
when that's the cost?

40:03.986 --> 40:05.226
Nathan's not picking up.

40:05.362 --> 40:06.693
Yeah, I can't reach Lexie either.

40:06.822 --> 40:11.031
Those crabs confirm the soft spot
has been ripped open.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.616
The great evil is at hand.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.452
An agony unlike we've ever known

40:16.582 --> 40:19.494
is about to arrive here in Haven.

40:19.626 --> 40:21.958
Okay, look,
let's just calm down and think.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.123
We need to tell Lexie and Nathan.

40:24.256 --> 40:28.295
Maybe Lexie learned something
in the barn about this great evil

40:28.427 --> 40:29.633
before she stepped
through that door.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.171
Could be she knows something
she doesn't even know

40:31.305 --> 40:33.091
she knows, you know?

40:33.223 --> 40:35.054
Does that make sense?

40:38.437 --> 40:41.019
Then there's Duke.

40:41.148 --> 40:43.389
He had to kill Wade,
his brother, because ——

40:43.525 --> 40:47.017
because the troubles haven't ended,
because you haven't killed me.

40:47.154 --> 40:48.940
And his pain...

40:50.532 --> 40:54.116
...the pain of everyone in this town,
it's on us.

40:58.373 --> 41:01.160
Maybe you can see it
the way I do?

41:03.587 --> 41:06.420
This is the most loving thing
we could possibly do.

41:06.548 --> 41:08.084
[Sighs]

41:19.895 --> 41:21.431
[Sighs]

41:24.399 --> 41:26.230
I love you.

41:29.738 --> 41:31.524
[Sighs]

41:33.408 --> 41:34.989
Well, that's all it says.

41:35.118 --> 41:37.655
Great suffering, agony, evil.

41:37.788 --> 41:40.450
—But what kind?
—It doesn't specify.

41:40.582 --> 41:43.790
Well, does it specify
something we can do about it?

41:43.919 --> 41:46.160
A solution to suffering
beyond imagining

41:46.296 --> 41:47.832
would be, you know, useful.

41:47.964 --> 41:50.671
Well, the Mi'kmaq
only gave Cabot a riddle.

41:50.801 --> 41:53.383
Now hang on,
let's see if I can find it.

41:56.181 --> 42:00.174
"What was once your salvation
is now your doom."

42:00.310 --> 42:01.516
That's it?

42:01.645 --> 42:03.681
Salvation is our doom?

42:03.814 --> 42:06.021
What do we think's our salvation?

42:06.149 --> 42:08.891
We think Nathan dying
will end the troubles.

42:09.027 --> 42:11.018
That's our salvation.

42:11.154 --> 42:15.147
But if this riddle is right,
then Audrey can't kill him now.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.444
I agree.
She'd better not.

42:18.537 --> 42:19.743
Wait a minute.

42:21.248 --> 42:23.284
Why did you call her Audrey?

42:23.417 --> 42:25.533
[Laughs]

42:25.669 --> 42:27.705
[Gunshot]
