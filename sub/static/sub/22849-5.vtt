22 UNANSWERED CALLS - HANNAH

01:12.250 --> 01:14.125
CAN WE TALK?

01:24.708 --> 01:25.708
CALL ENDED

03:07.333 --> 03:08.583
TRUTHS

03:08.666 --> 03:11.416
Winden. Another missing person's case
shocks the town.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.208
A nine-year-old boy
was reported missing this morning.

03:14.291 --> 03:15.125
MISSING

03:15.208 --> 03:17.916
Police officials have yet
to comment on the situation.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.125
But it can be assumed,
that this case, too,

03:20.208 --> 03:23.500
is connected to the disappearance
of two other children in Winden.

03:23.958 --> 03:27.625
The last case of a missing child
happened only three days ago.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.791
You know what happened to Erik and Mikkel?

03:31.875 --> 03:33.500
That they disappeared?

03:33.958 --> 03:36.375
The same thing happened to Yasin.

03:36.458 --> 03:37.875
My Yasin?

03:38.250 --> 03:43.125
Today he left home to go to school alone,
and he disappeared on the way there.

03:43.416 --> 03:45.458
If you know anything at all,

03:45.541 --> 03:47.916
then you have to tell me now.

03:55.041 --> 03:56.041
This Noah...

03:56.125 --> 03:59.541
What did he look like?
Can you describe him?

04:04.166 --> 04:06.541
Can you describe him?

04:09.416 --> 04:12.000
He was tall. As tall as Dad.

04:17.041 --> 04:18.625
He had a hat on.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.583
And blue eyes.

04:24.291 --> 04:26.500
Did Noah steal Yasin?

04:26.583 --> 04:27.833
I don't know.

04:28.166 --> 04:30.041
I'll send somebody by.

04:30.125 --> 04:34.375
And you will explain to him
exactly what this Noah looked like.

04:34.458 --> 04:35.291
Okay?

04:36.958 --> 04:39.708
Every little detail is important.

04:49.083 --> 04:52.583
What was that? You don't talk
to your eight-year-old daughter that way!

04:58.125 --> 05:00.416
Where were you the night Mikkel vanished?

05:02.750 --> 05:03.750
At the office.

05:04.458 --> 05:05.958
-I told you that.
-For how long?

05:07.041 --> 05:09.458
Until you called me. 11:00 p.m.

05:15.708 --> 05:17.666
I know you weren't in the office.

05:19.083 --> 05:21.958
If you have anything to do
with Mikkel's disappearance,

05:22.500 --> 05:26.250
or with Erik's or Yasin's,
then tell me now.

05:28.750 --> 05:30.833
I don't even want to know where you were,

05:30.916 --> 05:33.000
or what you were doing, or with whom.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.958
But I want you
to look into my eyes right now

05:36.041 --> 05:39.708
and assure me that you have nothing to do
with all of this.

05:47.333 --> 05:48.500
You're nuts.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.750
This is for you.

06:19.333 --> 06:21.416
Don't you finally want to talk to me?

06:28.250 --> 06:31.250
Is there maybe someone I should tell
that you're okay?

06:31.916 --> 06:33.791
Your parents, they...

06:34.916 --> 06:36.833
They must be worried.

06:38.416 --> 06:41.583
You don't have to say what happened to you
if you don't want to, but...

06:42.958 --> 06:44.375
If you want,

06:45.166 --> 06:47.791
no matter what it is, you can tell me.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.833
It's safe with me.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.750
I promise.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.333
WHERE (WHEN) IS MIKKEL

07:40.458 --> 07:43.125
Hey, this is Martha.
Leave a message after the signal.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.500
Hello?

08:23.583 --> 08:24.916
Hello, Bartosz.

08:25.375 --> 08:26.583
My name is Noah.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.291
How do you know my name?

08:39.125 --> 08:41.250
-Hello, Martha.
-Hello.

08:41.916 --> 08:44.375
I wanted Katharina to have...

08:46.541 --> 08:47.541
Hannah.

08:49.750 --> 08:53.500
I... I figured you weren't in the mood
to cook right now.

08:53.583 --> 08:54.750
With all of this.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.000
And...

08:56.083 --> 08:57.333
I thought...

09:02.875 --> 09:03.750
Thanks.

09:09.541 --> 09:10.375
Do you want to come in?

09:30.250 --> 09:33.500
How are Martha and Magnus?

09:41.666 --> 09:42.875
And Ulrich?

09:46.083 --> 09:47.416
I don't know.

09:51.125 --> 09:52.375
Where is he?

09:53.625 --> 09:55.000
In the shower.

10:04.666 --> 10:05.791
Hannah.

10:07.375 --> 10:08.708
What are you doing here?

10:09.583 --> 10:10.625
I...

10:13.291 --> 10:15.083
Hannah brought us some food.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.291
I have to go to the station.

10:27.166 --> 10:28.500
Could you give me a ride?

10:29.041 --> 10:30.208
I came by bike.

10:30.541 --> 10:31.666
It's raining so hard.

10:31.750 --> 10:34.125
-Only if...
-Of course Ulrich can give you a ride.

10:51.666 --> 10:52.875
Shall we?

10:57.958 --> 10:59.125
Hannah?

11:04.291 --> 11:05.500
Thanks for the food.

11:06.833 --> 11:07.666
Sure.

11:09.666 --> 11:12.125
And, really,
if you need anything, call me.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.791
Yes. No, I understand that.

11:33.875 --> 11:37.791
Still, on such short notice we have
to charge the full cancellation fee.

11:40.375 --> 11:42.750
Yes, well I'm sorry. Goodbye.

11:50.375 --> 11:52.458
Could you deliver this for me?

11:53.208 --> 11:55.875
-Here, locally.
-Are you leaving us already?

11:56.208 --> 11:58.208
I have to go away for a few days.

11:59.083 --> 12:01.083
But I'd like to keep the room if I can.

12:01.166 --> 12:04.916
-Certainly, that's no problem.
-It needs to be delivered by this evening.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.916
-It's important.
-Yes, of course.

12:29.500 --> 12:33.500
Where were you this morning?
I tried to reach you all morning.

12:35.208 --> 12:36.125
Therapy.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.833
Have you heard from Martha?

12:44.291 --> 12:46.291
She's not calling me back and...

12:46.375 --> 12:49.666
I don't know what she needs,
the whole thing is so fucked up.

12:52.791 --> 12:54.541
She'll get in touch when she's ready.

12:57.458 --> 13:00.500
Yeah, you're probably right.
Come on, let's play.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.583
-I follow you?
-Yeah, watch the corridors ahead.

13:14.041 --> 13:15.125
Can I trust you?

13:19.333 --> 13:20.958
If I tell you a secret.

13:21.666 --> 13:23.791
Can I trust you not to tell anyone else?

13:26.708 --> 13:27.583
Yeah, sure.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.375
I'm in contact with Erik's dealer.

13:31.708 --> 13:33.333
And I'm meeting him tonight.

13:33.416 --> 13:38.041
-You're doing what?
-Watch it! Shoot! Triangle! No!

13:38.875 --> 13:40.041
No!

13:43.625 --> 13:45.541
I'm going there tonight in any case.

13:46.791 --> 13:48.583
And I want you to come along.

13:50.333 --> 13:51.375
Can I count on you?

13:55.291 --> 13:57.000
Yeah, sure. Always.

13:57.916 --> 14:01.416
FOR CHARLOTTE

14:28.583 --> 14:29.833
I'm Noah.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.541
I'm a priest at St. Christopher's Church.

14:34.125 --> 14:35.500
Ines called me.

14:40.833 --> 14:41.958
Do you believe in God?

14:44.458 --> 14:46.750
How do you believe the world came to be?

14:46.833 --> 14:48.833
Who created all the beautiful things?

14:50.333 --> 14:52.416
The world came to be through the Big Bang.

14:53.125 --> 14:55.041
13.8 billion years ago.

14:55.583 --> 14:58.458
That's how space, time and matter
came to be,

14:58.541 --> 15:00.291
and Earth as well.

15:00.375 --> 15:02.000
The rest is evolution.

15:04.625 --> 15:06.291
And what was there before the Big Bang?

15:08.458 --> 15:10.458
Nothing can arise from nothing.

15:13.416 --> 15:17.125
Maybe the Big Bang is nothing more
than God's act of creation.

15:18.291 --> 15:21.791
My father says religion
is the brainwashing of the masses.

15:24.625 --> 15:26.625
I'm sure your father knows a lot,

15:27.416 --> 15:29.000
but he doesn't know everything.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.833
It's good that he raised you
to question things.

15:31.916 --> 15:35.958
But every now and then, it's good
to question those who question things.

15:38.625 --> 15:41.000
God has a plan for every human being.

15:41.666 --> 15:42.791
Including you.

15:54.916 --> 15:56.625
I want you to stop calling me.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.958
Okay? Just stop.

16:02.583 --> 16:05.125
-I can't do this anymore.
-Is that what I am to you?

16:06.916 --> 16:08.833
Some damn affair?

16:11.541 --> 16:13.666
It's not something
you can just switch off.

16:14.958 --> 16:16.208
I can't.

16:17.666 --> 16:19.083
And neither can you.

16:21.250 --> 16:22.541
Look at me.

16:24.791 --> 16:25.625
Look at me!

16:27.833 --> 16:30.375
And now tell me there's nothing there.

16:30.458 --> 16:32.333
That this doesn't mean shit to you.

16:36.291 --> 16:38.583
No matter what you need,
I'm here for you.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.416
What I need?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.541
Don't call me. Don't come by.
Just leave us alone.

16:57.625 --> 16:58.541
Okay?

17:06.250 --> 17:07.541
Get lost!

17:14.666 --> 17:17.208
Don't think
that I'm just going to let you go.

17:29.333 --> 17:32.041
And then she says,
"When you grow up your heart dies."

17:32.125 --> 17:36.041
That line hits you, bam!
Right in your face, you know?

17:37.166 --> 17:39.708
And in the end
you think they've become friends

17:39.791 --> 17:41.958
because that created a bond between them.

17:42.958 --> 17:46.000
But in the end, they're all stuck
in their little pigeonholes.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.458
Maybe you want to see it again with me?

17:51.291 --> 17:52.208
Hey!

17:52.291 --> 17:53.666
Are you even listening to me?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.083
Yeah.

17:55.166 --> 17:56.791
Let's talk later, okay?

18:02.833 --> 18:04.708
Hey, girls, what are you up to?

18:09.875 --> 18:12.125
-Want to go out for a smoke?
-Good idea.

18:31.958 --> 18:33.250
Are you sure?

18:38.041 --> 18:39.375
We don't have to if you don't want to.

18:41.708 --> 18:43.875
I'd rather do it with you
than some other guy.

18:47.208 --> 18:48.500
But you'll get condoms.

18:49.916 --> 18:51.791
I don't want AIDS and I don't want kids.

18:52.541 --> 18:54.041
No way, okay?

18:57.708 --> 18:59.541
-Yeah.
-I'm not joking.

19:01.250 --> 19:02.583
No kids.

19:03.458 --> 19:04.750
Never.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.250
I promise. No kids.

19:25.458 --> 19:28.000
Child Protective Services
will assume custody for now.

19:28.083 --> 19:33.000
So until we find his family
and can assess the situation better,

19:33.083 --> 19:34.750
he'll be put in a children's home.

19:35.125 --> 19:36.541
A children's home?

19:38.166 --> 19:41.333
Can't he stay here in the hospital
for a while?

19:41.916 --> 19:44.750
No. Unfortunately that's not possible.

19:45.458 --> 19:48.541
But I can assure you that
the people in the children's home

19:48.625 --> 19:52.375
will be able to attend
very specifically to his needs.

19:52.458 --> 19:53.958
It's best for him.

19:57.416 --> 19:58.916
Do you have children?

19:59.708 --> 20:00.708
No.

20:01.541 --> 20:04.208
I had a son
who died just after he was born.

20:05.791 --> 20:07.291
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:09.583 --> 20:13.125
I'm certain his family
will be in touch sooner or later.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.000
Or his school.

20:15.833 --> 20:18.000
We'll find out where he belongs.

20:20.916 --> 20:22.208
Well, then.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.583
He's a peculiar boy.

20:28.375 --> 20:30.041
Really very sensitive.

20:31.625 --> 20:33.291
Don't worry.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.500
I'll come get him on Wednesday.

20:45.458 --> 20:47.250
POLICE

20:47.333 --> 20:49.625
Do you know why I became a policeman?

20:51.125 --> 20:55.500
When my brother vanished back then,
they made every mistake in the book.

20:58.125 --> 21:00.541
The chief investigator
was a drunken moron.

21:03.708 --> 21:04.958
And I...

21:08.125 --> 21:10.291
I swore I'd do everything differently.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.583
That I'd do things right.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.541
That I wouldn't become
an incompetent asshole pig like him.

21:20.666 --> 21:22.208
That was 33 years ago.

21:26.708 --> 21:27.875
And now look at me.

21:28.916 --> 21:30.000
I'm a joke.

21:30.916 --> 21:32.458
I cheat on my wife.

21:33.833 --> 21:36.125
My son has vanished.
I can't do anything.

21:37.791 --> 21:39.166
Thirty-three years.

21:40.208 --> 21:41.333
Everything is the same.

21:42.791 --> 21:45.250
Just that now I'm the incompetent asshole.

21:47.333 --> 21:50.041
Have you ever heard of the 33-year cycle?

21:51.958 --> 21:55.208
Our calendars are wrong,
a year isn't 365 days long.

21:55.291 --> 21:57.708
We're always a bit "out of sync,"
so to speak.

21:58.166 --> 22:00.833
But every 33 years
everything is just like it was.

22:01.250 --> 22:06.125
The stars, the planets, the whole universe
returns to the exact same position.

22:07.416 --> 22:09.416
The lunar-solar cycle.

22:11.166 --> 22:14.583
My grandpa was obsessed with such things,
the Big Bang and the Big Crunch.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.750
Nietzsche's eternal recurrence.

22:19.583 --> 22:23.666
When I was little I always felt
that something was wrong with Winden.

22:24.375 --> 22:26.208
I have that same feeling again.

22:27.416 --> 22:29.583
That everything's repeating.

22:29.666 --> 22:31.583
That this has all happened before.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.916
Like a massive déjà vu.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.916
WINDEN BOY MISSING

23:00.250 --> 23:01.833
You look like him.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.250
Your father.

23:15.583 --> 23:16.583
Do we know each other?

23:21.708 --> 23:22.541
No.

23:23.708 --> 23:25.250
But I knew your father.

23:25.916 --> 23:28.958
It was a long time ago,
but I remember him well.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.416
He saved my life back then.

23:33.958 --> 23:36.000
But I only understood that much later.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.000
Life is a labyrinth.

23:40.666 --> 23:44.000
Some people wander around
their whole lives looking for a way out,

23:44.750 --> 23:47.250
but there's only one path
and it leads you ever deeper.

23:48.166 --> 23:51.125
You don't understand it
until you've reached the center.

23:56.583 --> 24:00.583
Death is incomprehensible,
but you can make peace with it.

24:05.750 --> 24:09.333
Till then you should ask yourself each day
if you've made the right decisions.

24:29.875 --> 24:31.875
DRY CLEANING

24:39.416 --> 24:40.625
This will take a while.

24:42.083 --> 24:43.625
Half an hour or so.

24:46.875 --> 24:48.875
Hey? Everything okay?

24:51.416 --> 24:52.458
Okay.

25:32.041 --> 25:34.375
I AM NOT AFRAID

25:47.333 --> 25:49.000
Do you think I'm pretty?

25:53.833 --> 25:55.041
Well, great.

26:03.041 --> 26:04.708
Know what I sometimes imagine?

26:05.875 --> 26:07.250
That I can do magic.

26:07.625 --> 26:10.958
I imagine that I want something.
Really badly.

26:11.041 --> 26:14.000
And then it happens, because I imagine it.

26:14.083 --> 26:15.416
Like moving that bottle cap.

26:21.041 --> 26:22.083
Do you know Houdini?

26:22.708 --> 26:23.541
Who?

26:23.625 --> 26:26.583
Harry Houdini,
one of the world's greatest magicians.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.958
There is no such thing as magic,
just illusion.

26:37.041 --> 26:39.458
Things only change when we change them.

26:39.875 --> 26:41.958
But you have to do it skillfully,

26:42.041 --> 26:43.541
in secret.

26:43.625 --> 26:45.208
Then it seems like magic.

26:48.750 --> 26:51.375
-Where did you learn that?
-I'm from the future.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.125
-You're cool.
-No, I'm Mikkel.

26:57.625 --> 26:59.958
Hi, Mikkel, boy from the future.
I'm Hannah.

27:43.291 --> 27:46.291
My mother told me about the old world.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.208
Before the flood.

27:49.416 --> 27:52.291
She said it had been of a different kind.
Foul.

27:53.583 --> 27:56.041
She would braid my hair
and recount harrowing tales,

27:56.875 --> 27:59.875
of my father
and of demons from the underworlds.

28:00.791 --> 28:03.166
She said all is forgiven
but nothing forgotten.

28:04.875 --> 28:07.333
Then the darkness in her eyes
was greater than usual.

28:07.416 --> 28:09.666
And her words flowed like waves.

28:10.875 --> 28:12.750
She said all was well now the way it was.

28:12.875 --> 28:13.708
MISSING

28:13.791 --> 28:17.583
That all occupied its own space,
in the past as in the here and now.

28:18.666 --> 28:21.833
When she spoke in this manner,
something would overcome her.

28:22.166 --> 28:23.625
She would pull my braids tightly

28:23.708 --> 28:27.208
as if to punish me for something
that dwelled in a place deep within her.

28:28.208 --> 28:30.375
Something that tugged at her
from the center,

28:30.458 --> 28:32.375
like a hunger that could not be satisfied.

28:32.833 --> 28:36.666
She spoke of yesterday
as though it were before her very eyes.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.208
As if today was but a veil

28:39.291 --> 28:42.750
that shrouded in shadow
all that was real to her.

28:44.875 --> 28:47.583
The old world came to haunt her
like a ghost

28:47.666 --> 28:52.625
that whispered to her in a dream how
to erect the new world, stone by stone.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.458
From then on,
I knew that nothing changes.

28:58.916 --> 29:00.625
That all things remain as before.

29:01.291 --> 29:02.875
The spinning wheel turns,

29:03.250 --> 29:05.458
round and round in a circle.

29:06.958 --> 29:09.375
One fate tied to the next.

29:09.875 --> 29:14.375
A thread, red like blood,
that cleaves together all our deeds.

29:15.541 --> 29:17.333
One cannot unravel the knots.

29:17.875 --> 29:19.708
But they can be severed.

29:20.291 --> 29:21.500
He severed ours,

29:22.541 --> 29:23.875
with the sharpest blade.

29:28.750 --> 29:31.125
Yet something remains behind
that cannot be severed.

29:33.583 --> 29:35.250
An invisible bond.

29:47.583 --> 29:48.500
CALL ENDED

29:53.000 --> 29:54.166
Fuck.

29:59.541 --> 30:01.416
On many a night, he tugs at it.

30:02.041 --> 30:05.458
And then I wake with a start,
knowing that nothing ceases to be.

30:08.208 --> 30:09.916
That all remains.

30:53.833 --> 30:54.833
That was great.

30:56.375 --> 30:57.208
You were great.

30:59.416 --> 31:01.750
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to tell you something.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.208
I wasn't in France.

31:11.125 --> 31:12.166
I was in the nuthouse.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.708
They call it post-traumatic stress.

31:16.166 --> 31:19.750
-Why didn't you say anything?
-I didn't want you to think I was a freak.

31:23.333 --> 31:27.875
What happened between us last summer,
that wasn't just nothing, was it?

31:31.041 --> 31:32.833
I mean, if my father hadn't...

31:36.041 --> 31:38.250
-If this all hadn't happened...
-It's okay.

31:43.625 --> 31:45.875
Why did you call me this morning
and not Bartosz?

32:53.083 --> 32:54.041
I'm Bartosz.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.083
I know.

32:57.208 --> 32:58.458
I'm Noah.

33:00.833 --> 33:02.333
Don't you want to get in?

34:08.833 --> 34:10.291
Are you cheating on me?

34:17.750 --> 34:19.541
Where did you get that idea?

34:23.625 --> 34:25.791
I'm only going to ask you this once.

34:26.916 --> 34:28.375
Are you cheating on me?

34:34.416 --> 34:36.166
I'd never do that.

34:52.875 --> 34:53.708
Dad?

34:57.708 --> 35:00.666
If you've seen something
you shouldn't have...

35:03.250 --> 35:04.083
What do you mean?

35:05.333 --> 35:08.291
Well, something that's not right.

35:08.791 --> 35:10.750
Not right in what sense?

35:11.375 --> 35:12.750
Well,

35:13.291 --> 35:18.000
if someone does something with someone
and it's wrong.

35:21.291 --> 35:22.458
What did you see?

35:25.625 --> 35:29.041
Ulrich touched her breasts
and laid on top of her.

35:30.208 --> 35:31.875
And she didn't want it.

35:34.916 --> 35:39.083
You're going to tell me
exactly what you saw, okay?

35:44.208 --> 35:46.625
And then he laid down on top of her

35:47.875 --> 35:50.583
and held her mouth shut.

35:51.208 --> 35:52.333
Like this.

35:54.208 --> 35:55.791
Did she resist?

35:58.875 --> 36:01.000
She yelled "stop" and struggled.

36:02.708 --> 36:04.458
But he was on top of her.

36:05.791 --> 36:07.000
Did he see you?

36:12.500 --> 36:14.083
What did he do then?

36:15.208 --> 36:19.625
-Did he...?
-He choked her and she went all red.

36:22.583 --> 36:27.208
-Then he pulled down his pants and...
-You don't have to continue.

36:29.125 --> 36:30.625
You did the right thing.

36:32.125 --> 36:33.708
You were very brave.

39:40.291 --> 39:42.833
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M.

39:49.208 --> 39:50.125
"Dear Jonas,

39:51.000 --> 39:55.041
by the time you read this everything
will have happened, irrevocably.

39:55.125 --> 39:56.750
It can no longer be changed.

39:59.125 --> 40:01.875
I would have liked
to explain things to you sooner,

40:02.666 --> 40:06.083
but I hope once you understand
how everything is connected,

40:07.333 --> 40:09.125
you will understand my decision.

40:09.208 --> 40:10.875
I AM NOT AFRAID

40:11.291 --> 40:13.708
The truth is a strange thing.

40:13.791 --> 40:16.041
You can try to suppress it,

40:16.125 --> 40:18.833
but it will always find its way
back to the surface.

40:19.833 --> 40:23.583
We make a lie into our truth
in order to survive.

40:24.375 --> 40:25.750
We try to forget.

40:26.708 --> 40:28.208
Until we can't anymore.

40:32.125 --> 40:35.041
We don't know
even half of the mysteries of this world.

40:36.625 --> 40:38.666
We are wanderers in the darkness.

40:39.458 --> 40:41.500
This is my truth.

40:43.125 --> 40:46.041
On November 4, 2019

40:46.125 --> 40:50.625
I traveled through time to the year 1986.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.125
The boy from the future stayed,

40:54.208 --> 40:56.250
and in time he became a man.

40:56.708 --> 40:59.208
Mikkel became Michael,

40:59.291 --> 41:01.333
who never knew where he belonged.

41:04.208 --> 41:07.083
By the time you read this
I'll already be gone.

41:08.875 --> 41:09.750
Mikkel?

41:10.166 --> 41:13.166
Both as a boy and as a man.

41:15.208 --> 41:17.166
I hope you can forgive me.

41:17.875 --> 41:20.000
Everything is connected.

41:21.250 --> 41:22.125
Mikkel,

41:22.708 --> 41:23.708
Michael."

41:36.541 --> 41:41.541
THIS BOOK BELONGS TO MIKKEL

42:09.916 --> 42:11.458
Can I help you?

42:14.166 --> 42:16.500
I'd like to talk to you about time.

45:02.750 --> 45:06.750
