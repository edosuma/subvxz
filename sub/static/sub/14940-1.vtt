Excuse me.

Let's share a cab.

[Gate squeaking]

12:12.525 --> 12:13.592
[Cell phone rings]

12:13.626 --> 12:14.926
It's the wife.

12:14.961 --> 12:18.130
Phone doesn't work inside.
I'll catch up.

12:18.164 --> 12:19.932
Hicks, what are you doing?

12:19.966 --> 12:21.033
You're not supposed to
take that off.

12:21.067 --> 12:22.835
Just letting her
have some fresh air.

12:22.869 --> 12:23.969
This is Binghamton.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.538
No, not just Binghamton.

12:25.572 --> 12:27.740
Nice girl like you
gets the upgrade.

12:29.476 --> 12:30.810
You think I'm scared?

12:30.844 --> 12:32.978
Go to hell, traitors.

12:35.048 --> 12:38.617
Hicks, that's why you're not
supposed to take that mask off.

12:38.652 --> 12:42.388
[Door buzzing open]

12:42.422 --> 12:44.022
Thank you, gentlemen.

12:44.057 --> 12:48.260
Please wait here
while I get her transfer papers.

12:48.294 --> 12:49.761
I hate this place.

12:49.796 --> 12:50.896
Well, it's part of the job.

12:50.930 --> 12:52.864
Just hold your nose,

12:52.899 --> 12:55.701
and think about that
government dental plan.

12:55.735 --> 12:58.737
Jamming pacifier chips
in the back of people's necks?

12:58.771 --> 13:00.405
It's not the job.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.907
It's <i>Night of the Living Dead.</i>

13:01.941 --> 13:04.275
What else we gonna do?
These people are violent.

13:04.310 --> 13:06.511
And they have abilities.
Lethal abilities.

13:06.546 --> 13:09.949
So at least this is humane.

13:09.983 --> 13:12.518
Humane?
What, like the S.P.C.A.?

13:12.552 --> 13:14.787
Alphas are rabid dogs now,
is that it?

13:14.821 --> 13:17.089
Megan Bates and her crew
pulled off 15 armed robberies,

13:17.124 --> 13:18.257
left five people dead.

13:18.291 --> 13:20.458
Now she definitely
belongs down here.

13:20.493 --> 13:23.395
All of these people
who are down here--

13:25.631 --> 13:26.965
Gary?

13:26.999 --> 13:29.401
It is Gary! Gary!

13:29.435 --> 13:31.570
Guard!

13:34.671 --> 13:36.982
This is from the National
Security Agency in Arlington

13:37.082 --> 13:38.583

13:38.617 --> 13:39.984
And you just
found out about this?

13:40.018 --> 13:41.919
N.S.A. won't tell you
what color the sky is

13:41.953 --> 13:43.321
without formal approval.

13:43.355 --> 13:46.257
We warned you about this
when you sent him over there.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.659
Gary's autistic.
He's got needs.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.227
He doesn't like to be touched.

13:50.261 --> 13:51.962
Gary's got a set routine,
specific food,

13:51.996 --> 13:54.465
and needs someone to listen
to him talk about cars.

13:54.499 --> 13:57.201
I told 'em.
You think they care?

13:57.235 --> 13:59.303
He sent two of their agents
to the hospital,

13:59.337 --> 14:03.007
they sent him here--
end of story.

14:14.151 --> 14:16.252
Hey, Dad?

14:16.287 --> 14:17.954
Ah, Dani, hi.

14:17.988 --> 14:20.055
You're early today.

14:20.090 --> 14:22.024
Yeah, yeah, I am.

14:22.058 --> 14:24.193
You okay?

14:24.227 --> 14:26.895
Yeah.
Yeah, it's just this...

14:26.929 --> 14:31.065
the level of sedation
is just completely gratuitous.

14:31.100 --> 14:33.902
Yeah.
Let me help.

14:39.107 --> 14:44.078
[Otherworldly swirling sound]

14:48.951 --> 14:50.217
Oh, thank you.

14:50.252 --> 14:53.988
Yeah, that's
a little bit better.

14:54.022 --> 14:57.258
I think your visits are
the only thing keeping me sane.

14:57.292 --> 15:02.130
So, how's everything
in your big bad world?

15:02.164 --> 15:03.331
Um...

15:03.365 --> 15:05.801
Dad, according to
your lawyers,

15:05.835 --> 15:09.304
the government is making you
look pretty bad.

15:09.339 --> 15:11.606
They brought up the LSD bust,

15:11.641 --> 15:13.575
everything that mom said
in the divorce papers.

15:13.609 --> 15:16.544
Well, I worry them
something fierce.

15:16.579 --> 15:18.880
They'll do whatever it takes
to discredit me.

15:18.914 --> 15:20.849
Well, Dad,
they're calling it

15:20.883 --> 15:23.519
a history of mental illness.

15:23.554 --> 15:27.056
I don't know if they're ever
gonna let you out of here.

15:27.091 --> 15:29.359
No, Dani, they are going to.

15:29.393 --> 15:31.794
And soon, I think.

15:31.829 --> 15:33.430
How can you be so sure?

15:33.464 --> 15:35.398
Because try as they might,
Dani,

15:35.433 --> 15:38.168
the government cannot
cover up everything.

15:38.203 --> 15:39.703
Plus...

15:39.738 --> 15:41.638
there's Stanton Parish.

15:41.673 --> 15:42.839
Hmm?

15:42.874 --> 15:45.976
Out there somewhere,
planning God knows what.

15:46.010 --> 15:47.511
Sooner or later,

15:47.545 --> 15:51.615
there will be an event--
or a series of events--

15:51.649 --> 15:54.851
they simply cannot control
without me.

15:54.885 --> 15:57.855
So that's what
I'm waiting for.

15:57.889 --> 15:59.656
An event.

15:59.691 --> 16:02.225
Okay, Miss Bates.

final diagnostic.

Why don't you just turn the
chip off for ten minutes, okay?

16:17.209 --> 16:18.242
So we can find out
what happened to our friend.

16:18.276 --> 16:20.244
There's nothing
that I can do.

16:20.279 --> 16:22.881
I understand, sir, but
it is our belief that Mr. Bell

16:22.915 --> 16:24.081
was simply mishandled.

16:24.116 --> 16:25.416
He is a valuable asset.

16:25.450 --> 16:26.818
They shouldn't have
stuck a chip in his brain!

16:26.852 --> 16:28.486

her in the whole damn system.

We're not negotiating.

But I'm here now,
and it's because I need you.

22:05.037 --> 22:08.506

you have to leave this room.

24:26.313 --> 24:27.546
What happened
between the two of you?

24:27.581 --> 24:28.781
- I woke up.
- Yeah? Is that what you call

24:28.815 --> 24:30.649
pushing everyone you meet?
You need help.

24:30.684 --> 24:32.351
You feel like
jumping off a building?

24:32.385 --> 24:33.753
- Nina.
- Please, both of you.

24:33.787 --> 24:35.788
You can discuss how much you
care about each other later.

24:35.823 --> 24:38.057
Right now, there are things
I need each of you to do

24:38.091 --> 24:39.325
while I'm out of contact.

24:39.359 --> 24:40.626
Out of contact?

24:40.661 --> 24:42.362
Yes. If I'm going to work with
the people inside,

24:42.396 --> 24:43.629
I need to be inside.

24:43.664 --> 24:47.066
Doc, you know, you...

24:47.101 --> 24:48.901
put a lot of these guys
in there.

24:48.936 --> 24:51.304
Now, what if all they wanna do
is get their hands on you, huh?

24:51.338 --> 24:54.841
Well, if that's the case,
this will all be over shortly.

24:54.875 --> 24:58.244
I'll do what I can in there,
and I'll relay what I discover

24:58.278 --> 24:59.712
to the three of you,
via Rachel.

24:59.746 --> 25:01.714
But if for some reason
I can't defuse the situation,

25:01.748 --> 25:04.517
then, Cameron...

25:04.551 --> 25:06.185
Right.
We play cavalry.

25:06.219 --> 25:07.252
Yes.
At the right moment.

25:07.287 --> 25:09.321
And only
if absolutely necessary.

25:09.356 --> 25:11.423
[Buzzer]

25:13.026 --> 25:14.526
Clear.

25:30.444 --> 25:32.211
Rachel?

25:32.245 --> 25:33.612
I'm in.

25:33.646 --> 25:36.482
I don't see anyone so far.

25:36.516 --> 25:38.651
If I bump into
any invisible Alphas,

25:38.685 --> 25:40.953
I'll let you know.

25:40.987 --> 25:43.489
It's deserted,
but I hear footsteps.

25:45.492 --> 25:47.526
I'm here to talk.

25:47.561 --> 25:49.028
[Footsteps]

25:49.062 --> 25:51.464
I'm not.

25:54.034 --> 25:55.568
Hello, Ted.

25:55.603 --> 25:57.804
You asked me
a lot of questions

25:57.838 --> 26:00.706
before you threw me in here.

26:00.741 --> 26:03.510
How I see weak spots,

26:03.544 --> 26:06.379
what they look like to me.

26:06.414 --> 26:09.650
Still curious?

26:09.684 --> 26:11.819
[Grunts]
Oh...ah...

26:11.853 --> 26:14.254
[Gasping]

26:14.288 --> 26:16.623
That's your radial nerve.

26:16.657 --> 26:18.358
Touchy, isn't it?

26:18.392 --> 26:20.493
I see Building Seven hasn't

26:20.527 --> 26:21.994
diminished your abilities any.

26:22.029 --> 26:25.931
Asher!

26:25.965 --> 26:27.933
This man is our guest.

26:30.103 --> 26:32.604
I'm sorry about that.

26:32.639 --> 26:34.673
Dr. Rosen?

26:34.707 --> 26:36.341
Cornell Scipio.

26:36.376 --> 26:38.844
I'm a big fan.

26:57.365 --> 27:00.401
Welcome to the monkey house.

27:11.468 --> 27:15.038
[Rosen's voice, muffled]

27:15.072 --> 27:17.707
Hey, Dr. Rosen's asking
to see Bill and Gary.

27:17.741 --> 27:19.275
Scipio's not going for it.

27:21.880 --> 27:24.415
[Muffled thuds]

27:24.449 --> 27:26.384
There's a banging...

27:26.418 --> 27:29.989
it's faint, but it's regular.

27:32.726 --> 27:35.261
Scipio's voice
just got angrier.

27:35.295 --> 27:36.395
He wants to know how Dr. Rosen

27:36.430 --> 27:38.431
can justify putting them
in there.

27:38.465 --> 27:39.766
How they've been treated.

27:39.800 --> 27:40.867
We are still
in building seven.

27:40.901 --> 27:42.468
We are rotting.

27:42.503 --> 27:43.836
Yes, I understand
your frustration.

27:43.871 --> 27:46.439
You all are
being treated deplorably.

27:46.473 --> 27:49.041
And...I want to change that.

27:49.076 --> 27:50.677
That's one of the main reasons

27:50.711 --> 27:52.879
I went public with the Alphas
situation in the first place.

27:52.913 --> 27:54.847
That's why I am here.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.883
I-I wa--I want to help.

27:56.917 --> 27:59.686
You wanna help.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.022
Okay...

28:02.056 --> 28:05.792
tell me--tell us
why we're so screwed up.

28:05.826 --> 28:08.962
You are not screwed up.

28:08.996 --> 28:11.398
If anything, you are all
extremely gifted.

28:11.432 --> 28:13.000
C'mon.

28:13.034 --> 28:14.034
I set things on fire.

28:14.068 --> 28:16.603
I make people's skin sizzle.

28:16.637 --> 28:19.472
Let's face it, they're never
gonna let us out of here.

28:19.507 --> 28:20.974
I'm a mistake.

28:21.008 --> 28:23.476
We are all mistakes.

28:23.511 --> 28:27.013
Maybe we all belong
in a cage.

28:27.048 --> 28:28.848
And here comes the line about
how there are no mistakes.

28:28.883 --> 28:31.084
We're all just people.

28:31.118 --> 28:32.319
Kumbaya.

28:32.353 --> 28:33.987
No.

28:34.022 --> 28:36.557
Actually Dr. Rosen isn't
giving him any sympathy at all.

28:36.591 --> 28:39.426
Your ability
isn't the mistake.

28:39.461 --> 28:41.862
The mistake is how you--
you choose to use it.

28:41.897 --> 28:44.265
Yes. That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

28:44.299 --> 28:46.434
What in my brain
makes me different?

28:46.468 --> 28:49.603
Can--hey--
can I turn it off?

28:49.638 --> 28:52.306
You really want to
talk about this right now.

28:52.340 --> 28:54.174
Yeah.

28:54.209 --> 28:57.011
Can't hear a damn thing.

28:57.045 --> 28:59.613
I get up at 7:42.

28:59.648 --> 29:01.115
What'd you say?

29:01.149 --> 29:02.416
Get up--

29:02.451 --> 29:04.752
I get up at 7:42.
Brush my teeth.

29:04.786 --> 29:05.786
Dress myself appropriately

29:05.820 --> 29:07.721
in shirt and pants.
Right.

29:07.756 --> 29:09.890
You have to wear pants,
even if they're uncomfortable.

29:09.924 --> 29:11.892
It's important to wear pants
when you leave the house.

29:11.926 --> 29:13.426
Right.

29:13.461 --> 29:15.362
It's important to wear pants,
and it's important

29:15.396 --> 29:19.032
to interact with people.
Right, Gary?

29:19.066 --> 29:21.634
I get up at 7:42.
Brush my teeth.

29:21.669 --> 29:23.970
And I dress myself--
Gary. No, Gary.

29:24.004 --> 29:25.705
[Sighs]

29:25.739 --> 29:28.408
Whenever you are stressed
or you feel threatened

29:28.443 --> 29:30.577
your sweat glands
produce two chemicals

29:30.611 --> 29:33.380
that when combined
combust.

29:33.414 --> 29:34.748
Oh, so I'm combustible.

29:34.782 --> 29:36.783
That's...cute.

29:36.818 --> 29:39.619
But, uh, actually,
at the moment you seem

29:39.654 --> 29:42.156
quite calm,
despite your condition.

29:42.190 --> 29:44.225
Which strikes me as, um...

29:44.259 --> 29:48.663
a bit odd, given the situation
we're in right now.

29:52.502 --> 29:55.939
Is this a delaying tactic,
Mr. Scipio?

29:55.973 --> 29:59.509
No, no, no, no, no,
my questions matter.

29:59.544 --> 30:02.846
'Cause if I'm a mistake
and I can't change that,

30:02.881 --> 30:05.182
where does that end?

30:05.217 --> 30:08.986
A mistake isn't human,
a mistake is...

30:09.020 --> 30:10.321
something else.

30:10.355 --> 30:12.456
A "them".

30:12.490 --> 30:15.725
Us versus them.

30:15.760 --> 30:19.296
And I don't get to choose
whose side I'm on.

30:19.330 --> 30:21.231
That, uh...
sounds like

30:21.265 --> 30:22.832
something coming from
Stanton Parish.

30:22.867 --> 30:25.469
Stanton Parish, where's that?
Somewhere near Baton Rouge?

30:25.503 --> 30:27.271
Baby?

30:27.305 --> 30:29.940
We're ready.

30:29.974 --> 30:33.777
Ready for what?

30:33.811 --> 30:36.279
What's going on?

30:36.313 --> 30:37.514
I was right.

30:37.548 --> 30:40.016
Th-this has all been a ruse.

30:40.051 --> 30:41.919
Listen to me, Cornell.

30:41.953 --> 30:43.487
There is no "us" or "them".

30:43.521 --> 30:45.789
You are not a mistake.

30:45.824 --> 30:47.358
Thinking that way
is the mistake, and--

30:47.392 --> 30:48.859
and you can prove it
to yourself,

30:48.894 --> 30:50.628
you can prove your humanity.

30:50.662 --> 30:52.396
Just let these hostages go,
and I promise--

36:07.299 --> 36:09.300
Asher's out cold.

36:09.335 --> 36:12.337
Where's Scipio?

36:12.371 --> 36:14.205
Rachel?

36:15.708 --> 36:19.210
He's gone.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.048
Let's face it, Nathan,

36:23.082 --> 36:24.782
you can't control
the Alphas situation.

36:24.817 --> 36:26.484
You haven't found Parish yet,

36:26.518 --> 36:28.786
and you, or whomever else
is in charge,

36:28.821 --> 36:30.889
can't cover this up forever.

36:30.923 --> 36:32.123
For the past eight months

36:32.157 --> 36:34.859
you've been fighting
a losing battle.

36:34.894 --> 36:37.028
Look, what happened in
Building Seven, it was bad.

36:37.062 --> 36:39.130
But those hostages
came out alive.

36:39.164 --> 36:40.398
You and your team
made that happen.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.667
Yeah, we did what we could.
Listen.

36:42.702 --> 36:44.736
Why don't you just tell me
what you want to tell me?

36:44.770 --> 36:47.071
We need you.

36:47.106 --> 36:48.673
We need you to pull
your team back together,

36:48.707 --> 36:50.141
and deal with the Building
Seven escapees,

36:50.176 --> 36:52.276
and keep a lid on
this entire mess.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.911
Well, why didn't
the government think of that

36:53.946 --> 36:56.180
before they
institutionalized me?

36:56.215 --> 36:57.982
The government is 100,000
feudal kingdoms

36:58.017 --> 37:01.019
all fighting for money
and control.

37:01.053 --> 37:02.387
Sure, you got some enemies
in D.C.,

37:02.421 --> 37:03.721
but you got some friends, too.

37:03.756 --> 37:06.390
And what are these friends
offering me?

37:06.425 --> 37:08.960
A full pardon.
A cause.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.828
And a fat consulting fee.

37:10.863 --> 37:12.063
It'll be just like
the old days.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.732
[Chuckles]

37:13.766 --> 37:16.802
Ah, you know, there's a reason
they call them the old days,

37:16.836 --> 37:18.937
is because they are old.

37:18.971 --> 37:21.672
Lee, I got you
a sweet deal here.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.207
Take it.

37:23.241 --> 37:27.144
Or you'll end up
back in your rubber room.

37:27.178 --> 37:31.181
All right, so, if uh,
you or whomever wants me back,

37:31.215 --> 37:32.716
I need to run the program.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.585
I decide what happens
to the Alphas we locate.

37:35.619 --> 37:38.554
I approve of the assignments,
and with no interference.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.524
Or I'm out.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.265
Hey, Gary.
My mom's hummus.

37:44.783 --> 37:46.184
Your favorite.

37:46.218 --> 37:47.485
Rachel, he's not
a dog, okay?

37:47.519 --> 37:48.619
He doesn't respond to treats.

37:48.654 --> 37:49.954
Dogs don't like hummus.

37:49.988 --> 37:51.255
Do they, Gary?

37:51.289 --> 37:52.289
I thought you said
he was talking.

37:52.324 --> 37:53.357
Yeah, he was.

37:53.391 --> 37:55.759
You know, Gary-babble,
but...

37:55.794 --> 37:56.760
after the crash, not a peep.

37:56.795 --> 37:58.662
I figured if you
bring him to us--

37:58.696 --> 38:01.865
familiar surroundings--
he'd feel something, or--

38:01.900 --> 38:04.134
Maybe he just needs some time,
okay, just to get adjusted.

38:04.169 --> 38:05.936
Come on, Gary.

38:05.970 --> 38:08.105
Gary, c'mon, look.
Gary.

38:08.139 --> 38:09.172
C'mon now,
look around here.

38:09.207 --> 38:11.275
All right?
Look.

38:11.309 --> 38:12.843
Everybody's here.

38:12.877 --> 38:16.847
You're back at work.
What do you do?

38:16.881 --> 38:19.383
You greet your co-workers
appropriately, right?

38:19.417 --> 38:22.786
So, come on.
Come on, greet me.

38:22.821 --> 38:24.788
Come on,
you bastard, greet me.

38:24.823 --> 38:26.991
Look, I'll let you drive--
no.

38:27.025 --> 38:28.259
You're--you're on
the right track.

38:28.293 --> 38:30.094
Still, um...

38:30.128 --> 38:32.964
may I?

38:32.998 --> 38:35.867
He's all yours.

38:35.901 --> 38:38.470
Uh, Gary?

38:38.504 --> 38:39.805
I, uh, understand why
you're not, uh,

38:39.839 --> 38:42.374
greeting everyone.

38:42.409 --> 38:45.611
Uh, greetings usually happen
at 9:00 a.m.

38:45.646 --> 38:48.815
Uh, so, now it is,
uh, 3:14.

38:48.849 --> 38:50.683
Now, we're not on a case.

38:50.718 --> 38:55.054
What do you usually do
around 3:14?

38:55.089 --> 38:57.023
Okay, this is hopeless.
He's exactly the same way

38:57.057 --> 38:58.491
as he was when we first met him.
Don't say that.

38:58.525 --> 39:00.026
Wait, wait wait, wait.
He just--

39:00.060 --> 39:02.395
he just looked at me.
You see that?

39:02.429 --> 39:03.862
Gary, let's imagine today.
All right?

39:03.897 --> 39:06.365
You, uh...
You got up at 7:42.

39:06.399 --> 39:08.567
You brushed your teeth, as--

39:08.601 --> 39:12.004
as usual, and then you--
you got dressed, you know?

39:12.038 --> 39:15.374
Shirt, socks,
shoes, pants, right?

39:15.408 --> 39:17.477
Right.
You gotta wear pants,

39:17.511 --> 39:20.379
because that's important, right?
Mmhmm.

39:20.414 --> 39:23.349
And then you, uh, went
downstairs, you got breakfast,

39:23.383 --> 39:24.750
and then you came in.

39:24.784 --> 39:27.553
And you greeted everyone.
Um...

39:27.587 --> 39:29.789
And then you worked, uh,
you had lunch,

39:29.823 --> 39:33.526
and now it is, uh--
well, you've been here all day.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.729
So, what do you
normally do then?

39:38.666 --> 39:39.933
She's worried about you, Gary.

39:39.967 --> 39:41.468
She hasn't heard from you.

39:41.502 --> 39:44.037
What are you going to do?

39:47.342 --> 39:49.977
[Phone beeps, line rings]

39:50.011 --> 39:51.144
This is Sandra Bell.

39:51.179 --> 39:53.180
Leave a message.
No, it's the voicemail.

39:53.214 --> 39:55.215
- I'll call you back. [Beeps]
- I hate the voicemail.

39:55.250 --> 39:57.217
Mom! I'm at the office,
and I'm fine.

39:57.252 --> 39:59.253
I don't have a chip in my head
anymore.

39:59.287 --> 40:00.988
Okay, bye.
[Phone beeps]

40:01.022 --> 40:02.890
- Gary--
- I--no, don't do that.

40:02.924 --> 40:04.658
I know, I know.
I didn't mean to. I--

40:04.693 --> 40:06.193
- My personal space.
- I know, I know--

40:06.228 --> 40:07.795
Too bad, 'cause here comes
another one.

40:07.829 --> 40:10.297
- No, Bill, get off me!
- There you go. C'mon!

40:10.332 --> 40:11.832
You called me a bastard.
That's not nice.

40:11.866 --> 40:13.400
You tell 'em, Gary.

40:13.435 --> 40:14.568
Yeah, uh--
Bill, you know what?

40:14.603 --> 40:15.836
You're the bastard.

40:15.870 --> 40:16.870
You're right.

40:16.905 --> 40:18.072
You left me with N.S.A.

40:18.106 --> 40:20.074
And they made me
spy on my friends.

40:20.108 --> 40:21.575
And then--and then,
they wouldn't answer

40:21.610 --> 40:23.377
when I greeted them
appropriately.

40:23.412 --> 40:25.547
And they put me
in Building Seven, Bill.

40:25.581 --> 40:26.948
And you just left me there.
I'm-

40:26.983 --> 40:28.483
You all left me there.

40:28.518 --> 40:29.918
Yes, Gary, uh--
that's right.

40:29.953 --> 40:31.619
W-w--I did.

40:31.654 --> 40:32.687
And, uh,
that was a mistake.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.256
Yeah! Mistake.

40:34.290 --> 40:37.526
But, now, we are
going to make them right.

40:37.561 --> 40:41.096
All of us.

40:41.131 --> 40:42.698
Together.

40:50.542 --> 40:52.209
We, uh...
We stored a few things

40:52.243 --> 40:54.645
in your office
while you were gone.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.213
I'm--I'm gonna
help you get 'em out.

40:56.248 --> 40:57.248
All right?
Okay.

40:57.282 --> 40:58.549
Thanks.

40:58.584 --> 41:00.551
Wait.
Hicks, why are you--

41:00.586 --> 41:01.753
what kinds of things?

41:01.787 --> 41:03.621
Smelly things?

41:03.655 --> 41:06.357
Hicks?

41:06.391 --> 41:07.692
I'm glad to have you back.

41:07.726 --> 41:09.761
Yeah. No, don't do that.
I don't like that.

41:09.795 --> 41:12.663
Too bad.

41:41.660 --> 41:45.329
Stanton.

41:45.363 --> 41:47.798
It's a little dramatic,
don't you think?

41:47.832 --> 41:50.535
Holding a meeting
in the wasteland?

41:50.569 --> 41:51.636
Hmm.

41:51.670 --> 41:53.237
Sentimental, actually.

41:53.272 --> 41:55.206
Marched through here
during the war.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.941
It was orchards then.

41:56.976 --> 41:59.010
All the way to the river.

42:00.812 --> 42:03.948
Now it's a pit.

42:03.982 --> 42:06.917
Yeah, people really do screw
everything up, don't they?

42:06.952 --> 42:11.055
The smokestack has ever
waged war on the apple tree.

42:11.089 --> 42:12.823
We'll put an end to that.

42:12.857 --> 42:16.293
Better people, better world.

42:16.328 --> 42:18.429
How's your father?

42:18.463 --> 42:21.265
He's free.
Like you said.

42:21.299 --> 42:22.266
I just got the call.

42:22.300 --> 42:24.135
Good.

42:24.169 --> 42:26.971
Such injustice,
him rotting away in there.

42:27.006 --> 42:30.808
I'm glad that he can
benefit from our efforts.

42:30.843 --> 42:32.243
Still...

42:32.278 --> 42:37.081
miles to go before we sleep.

42:37.116 --> 42:41.152
Let's get to work.
