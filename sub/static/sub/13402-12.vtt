WEBVTT

00:02.930 --> 00:04.921
- Read the tag.
- He wants us to play.

00:04.930 --> 00:06.522
(Hanna)
'No, Em,
it wants to play with us.‘

00:06.540 --> 00:07.734
Hannah, Katherine Daly.

00:07.740 --> 00:09.264
I'm doing a fundraiser
for my dad

00:09.270 --> 00:10.999
and [’0' laws to wear
someth/ng new.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.238
I would be thrilled
if you wore

00:12.240 --> 00:13.730
- one of my dresses.
- Absolutely.

00:13.740 --> 00:16.334
This is a .45,
and you were shot with a .22

00:16.350 --> 00:17.942
No, I'm saying there were
two guns

00:17.950 --> 00:19.144
_one_ of which
IS still missing

00:19.150 --> 00:21.243
just like Jenna Marshall
and Mary Drake.

00:21.250 --> 00:23.070
- I'm pregnant.
- Is it Archer's?

00:23.090 --> 00:25.240
- Of course.
- I support you.

00:25.250 --> 00:27.445
- Whatever you decide.
- This isn't your problem.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.655
Aria, you're gonna plan this
wedding, and it's going to be

00:29.660 --> 00:31.981
waiting for him
while he says goodbye to Nicole.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.150
Holden?
What are you doing here?

00:33.160 --> 00:34.991
This is my sister's business.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.491
She needed a brilliant
but affordable chef.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.024
- Mary Drake.
- What did she tell you?

00:39.040 --> 00:40.291
She said that
you are not my mother

00:40.300 --> 00:42.268
my birth mother.
That she is..

00:42.270 --> 00:43.999
(Hanna)
Well, if the note really did
come out of that thing

00:44.010 --> 00:45.705
I say we get a crowhar
and see what else is in there.

00:45.710 --> 00:46.938
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:46.940 --> 00:48.828
(Spencer)
'That's us digging up Rollins.‘

00:48.840 --> 00:50.637
'A.D. knows we killed him.'

00:53.520 --> 00:55.818
- 'Can it see us or not?'
- Guess.‘

00:55.820 --> 00:58.687
It's punishing Hanna for
attacking it with a steak knife.

00:58.690 --> 01:00.749
- This is ridiculous.
- 'Emily.‘

01:00.760 --> 01:02.648
If this person knows
we killed Rollins--

01:02.660 --> 01:04.287
Why are you giving them
that much power?

01:04.290 --> 01:06.281
"Them" is
a vindictive blind girl.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.222
- This can't be just Jenna.
- Why not?

01:08.230 --> 01:10.448
Because she's a vindictive
blind girl.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.165
How can she create a board game
when she can't even tell

01:12.170 --> 01:13.762
if her blouse is on inside out?

01:13.770 --> 01:15.590
Well, it didn't stop anyone
from selling her a firearm.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.137
Okay, we are not playing
this game.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.608
- Too late.
- I said that I was sorry.

01:20.610 --> 01:23.704
Spence, you don't have
to apologize. We get it.

01:23.710 --> 01:26.372
Get what?
That letter was bait, Aria.

01:26.380 --> 01:29.611
Like some fat, juicy worm that
was stuck on an electronic hook.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.180
- From Jenna, who had help.
- Her help is dead.

01:32.190 --> 01:34.681
His head rolled over
your feet, remember?

01:34.690 --> 01:38.182
Forget Noel Kahn. What about
that Sydney What's-Her-Face?

01:38.190 --> 01:39.885
Oh, please. Let's not go there.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.856
Em, you've already been there.

01:41.860 --> 01:44.090
Jenna once tried_to_ use her
as a spy, did It—-

01:44.100 --> 01:46.318
Okay, it's not about
who started the game.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.137
It's-it's how they are getting
exactly what they want.

01:48.140 --> 01:50.768
We're all scrambling like mice,
like we're still in high school.

01:50.770 --> 01:52.169
You are.

01:52.170 --> 01:53.569
I park in the faculty lot now,
Hanna. Okay?

01:53.580 --> 01:55.434
And I'm not gonna let
Jenna or Sydney

01:55.440 --> 01:57.476
or any other sadistic freak
who's watched "Jumanji"

01:57.480 --> 01:59.698
too many times turn me into
a tenth grade victim again.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.177
They have footage of us burying
Rollins' body.

02:02.180 --> 02:03.374
If that gets out to the police—-

02:03.390 --> 02:04.641
Then we tell the police
what we left out

02:04.650 --> 02:06.481
when we thought
Hanna was kidnapped.

02:06.490 --> 02:09.516
Alison was tortured by this
freak. He deserved way worse.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.181
I agree with you, Emily, and it
might not be first-degree murder

02:12.190 --> 02:14.124
but we still kind of
broke a few laws.

02:14.130 --> 02:16.052
Yeah, not enough
to play this game. Okay.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.651
I'm done. I mean it.

02:20.700 --> 02:23.669
[sighs]
Okay.

02:23.670 --> 02:25.831
She doesn't just get
to walk out like that.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.535
I may have been the one
driving the car

02:27.540 --> 02:30.703
but we have to be
in this together.

02:30.710 --> 02:32.678
We are, Hanna.

02:32.680 --> 02:33.840
'We are.‘

02:42.490 --> 02:44.651
Got a secret_
can you keep It?

02:44.660 --> 02:47.288
Swear this one you'll save

02:47.300 --> 02:49.951
Better lock it
in your pocket

02:49.970 --> 02:52.222
Taking this one to the grave

02:52.230 --> 02:57.395
If I show you then I know
you won't tell what I said

02:57.410 --> 03:00.129
'Cause two can keep a secret

03:00.140 --> 03:02.608
If one of them is dead

03:07.120 --> 03:08.974
Excuse me?

03:08.980 --> 03:10.538
Hi, uh, sorry.

03:10.550 --> 03:13.110
I just noticed you were coming
out of Ezra Fitz's loft.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.985
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- Oh.

03:14.990 --> 03:18.357
Uh, Jared Healy. I work
for the "Philly Inquirer."

03:18.360 --> 03:20.225
I've been trying to get
in touch with Ezra Fitz

03:20.230 --> 03:21.595
for a couple of days.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.056
I even left five messages,
but he, uh--

03:23.070 --> 03:24.526
What's this about?

03:24.530 --> 03:26.919
Oh, a human-interest story
my editor's hired on.

03:26.940 --> 03:30.330
Local author reunited
with his long-lost fiancee.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.364
They'd like to run it
next weekend.

03:31.370 --> 03:33.235
What do you mean reunited?

03:33.240 --> 03:35.504
Well, she was presumed dead.

03:35.510 --> 03:38.399
Um...yeah.

03:38.410 --> 03:41.777
Nicole Gordon
was never hIS fiancee.

03:41.780 --> 03:43.316
Iam.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.880
Oh, I didn't realize
there were two of you.

03:49.460 --> 03:51.257
Why did you put Lopez fourth?

03:51.260 --> 03:52.852
She performs well
under pressure.

03:52.860 --> 03:55.522
Her adrenaline kicks in, and
she goes into a complete zone.

03:55.530 --> 03:57.794
- I remember that feeling.
- Yeah.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.826
It's kinda hard to forget
when we're still standing here.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.592
It is crazy, isn't it?

04:05.940 --> 04:07.931
Em, I'm sorry.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.339
What I said
in the teachers' lounge

04:09.350 --> 04:11.375
bringing up
all that stuff about Alison.

04:11.380 --> 04:13.041
I know how much
she means to you.

04:13.050 --> 04:16.611
Don't apologize. It's my fault.

04:16.620 --> 04:19.748
I have this intense history
with the both of you.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.856
'You and Ali
have your own weird history.‘

04:23.860 --> 04:26.658
When you told me what she did
that night on my porch, I..

04:27.900 --> 04:30.653
...I fell for you hard.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.797
'Wanted to protect you
ever since.‘

04:32.800 --> 04:35.633
I'd like to think
I'm a little stronger now.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.858
You are.

04:37.870 --> 04:39.406
We all are.

04:40.940 --> 04:44.068
Post it. I've got to get
to a budget meeting.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.547
Go.

04:49.290 --> 04:53.078
Addison, I didn't know
you were in here.

04:53.090 --> 04:54.489
I'm a quiet dresser.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.354
You're late to first period.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.578
Yeah, well, it's computer lab.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.625
I've been typing
since I was two.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.494
Why did you miss
yesterday's practice?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.093
I went home early. I was sick.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.035
Mmm. You seemed to have
recovered pretty quickly.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.439
It was a headache.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.136
Why, are you sorry
it wasn't a tumor?

05:16.150 --> 05:17.799
You should get to class.

05:32.430 --> 05:34.079
What's the time frame?

05:35.960 --> 05:37.825
I see. Well, if..

05:37.830 --> 05:39.764
If you think
a couple more weeks will help..

05:41.570 --> 05:43.936
Can I call you back? Thanks.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.901
Hey, there.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.235
- What's that?
- Gil just left a message.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.468
They want to sign the lease
on the field office in Philly

05:53.480 --> 05:55.641
so do you wanna see that
before it becomes a reality?

05:55.650 --> 05:58.244
Sounds like that would be wise.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.980
Maybe you and I can go down
there this afternoon.

06:00.990 --> 06:02.457
We could stop
and have a nice lunch--

06:02.460 --> 06:04.018
Who was on the phone?

06:05.130 --> 06:06.882
Was it dad?

06:08.500 --> 06:10.525
How long is he gonna put off
coming home to face me?

06:10.530 --> 06:12.066
Honey, your father's
not avoiding you.

06:12.070 --> 06:13.321
He'll be back this Thursday.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.864
He's left you several messages.

06:14.870 --> 06:16.997
Yeah, this isn't really the kind
of conversation I wanna have

06:17.010 --> 06:19.433
while he's in a hotel lobby.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.874
He's hurting too, Spencer.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.701
This isn't how either one of us
wanted you to find out.

06:24.710 --> 06:27.770
What does Melissa know?

06:27.780 --> 06:31.079
Did she sign some secret family
pact to keep me in the dark too?

06:31.090 --> 06:32.648
Your sister loves you.

06:32.650 --> 06:34.186
'Cause she acted like
she was in shock

06:34.190 --> 06:36.784
when she found out
that we were related to Jason.

06:36.790 --> 06:39.020
I mean, if she knew that
dad had already strayed once

06:39.030 --> 06:40.679
then why did she put on
such a big show?

06:40.700 --> 06:42.850
Why didn't she just
tell me then?

06:42.870 --> 06:45.623
_Melissa isn't aware of _all the
Circumstances surrounding the--

06:45.630 --> 06:47.928
Wow. So only you and dad
could appreciate

06:47.940 --> 06:49.896
the bitter irony
of me checking into

06:49.910 --> 06:51.639
the same mental hospital
where I was born.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.006
Please don't do that.

06:54.010 --> 06:57.468
You have no idea how hard it was
for me to walk into that place.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.278
Yeah, well, you got to walk out.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.043
It feels like a part of me
will be living there

07:02.050 --> 07:03.847
for the rest of my life.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.919
[door opens]

07:09.590 --> 07:11.421
[knock on door]

07:12.900 --> 07:16.529
She drooled over all of them,
but she's desperate to wear

07:16.530 --> 07:18.361
what was behind
door number three.

07:18.370 --> 07:19.394
Okay, slow down.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.594
She kept droning on about gloves

07:20.600 --> 07:21.931
but I talked her out
of that one.

07:21.940 --> 07:23.760
I'm like "Katie, you start
covering up your arms

07:23.770 --> 07:25.533
"people are gonna think
that you're a stripper

07:25.540 --> 07:26.837
"or a junkie or both.

07:26.840 --> 07:30.003
Just hit refresh
on that spray tan, hon."

07:31.850 --> 07:34.978
Okay, those aren't from my rack.
You went through my closet?

07:34.980 --> 07:38.040
Well, I wanted her to see
the best, and you weren't here.

07:38.050 --> 07:40.382
And this was before
our boundaries treaty.

07:40.390 --> 07:42.756
So take a chill pill, Donatella.

07:44.060 --> 07:48.053
This...is what gave her
palpitations.

07:48.060 --> 07:49.789
[gaSPS]

07:49.800 --> 07:52.121
- What's wrong?
- She can't wear that.

07:52.130 --> 07:53.392
Why not? It fits her perfectly.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.038
Uh, she can't wear that dress.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.691
Okay, why are you eating
insecurity for breakfast?

07:57.710 --> 08:01.202
- Hanna, this dress is genius.
- It's not an option.

08:01.210 --> 08:03.474
I can't pull the sucker
out of her mouth, Hanna.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.629
She loves this one.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.845
Well, talk her into another one.

08:06.850 --> 08:07.999
Why?

08:08.020 --> 08:09.214
[sighs]

08:10.590 --> 08:13.889
Han, no masterpiece
is ever complete.

08:13.890 --> 08:16.552
If someone hadn't pulled
Mona Lisa off Da Vinci's easel

08:16.560 --> 08:18.778
he would have given her a perm.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.826
When did she have a perm?

08:20.830 --> 08:22.127
Okay, I can't do this right now.

08:22.130 --> 08:24.496
I have to go to
a jewelry designer in Milford.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.593
Call me after you've had
your coffee.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.066
[door closes]

08:32.070 --> 08:35.676
Alright, "Twelfth Night" paper
is due on Friday.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.932
If you haven't picked a theme,
please do so.

08:37.950 --> 08:40.407
It helps if you actually
read the play.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.980
[indistinct chatter]

08:44.620 --> 08:45.848
Can I talk to you?

08:45.850 --> 08:48.250
It's not a good time.

08:48.260 --> 08:51.582
Addison, there's no record
of you leaving sick yesterday.

08:51.590 --> 08:53.854
When did this become
a federal investigation?

08:53.860 --> 08:56.590
'Your teammates were
in that pool gIVIng a 110%.'

08:56.600 --> 08:58.227
If you miss practice
without a valid excuse--

08:58.230 --> 09:00.118
What do you need, an X-ray?

09:00.140 --> 09:01.289
'My head was throbbing.‘

09:01.300 --> 09:04.269
Listening to your rusty whistle
wasn't gonna help.

09:04.270 --> 09:05.703
[scoffs]

09:05.710 --> 09:08.338
You're off the line-up
for Saturday's meet.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.171
You sure you wanna do that?

09:12.280 --> 09:13.679
[scoffs]

09:21.060 --> 09:23.881
- Is it just me or she's-—
- She's worse.

09:23.890 --> 09:25.255
At least
when I threatened adults

09:25.260 --> 09:26.557
I looked up from my phone.

09:27.060 --> 09:28.618
[sighs]

09:28.630 --> 09:30.825
What if I have one like her?

09:30.830 --> 09:32.627
Or me?

09:32.630 --> 09:35.269
- So you decided—-
- No.

09:35.270 --> 09:38.535
I'm just trying to go one day
without thinking about it.

09:38.540 --> 09:40.906
Tick tock.

09:40.910 --> 09:43.629
Why don't I come over?
Bring you dinner.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.379
You shouldn't be alone
right now.

09:45.380 --> 09:46.699
I'm not.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.472
There's a mini-me waving to me

09:48.480 --> 09:50.710
from a board game next door.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.314
Probably scheming to make
my situation worse.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.083
If that's even possible.

09:57.490 --> 09:58.855
Come here.

10:08.870 --> 10:10.838
I left my phone on vibrate
while I was running.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.239
Sorry, I didn't
get your message until then.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.834
No, I'm.. You didn't have
to rush over, I--

10:14.840 --> 10:17.138
You sounded fragile.
What's wrong?

10:18.410 --> 10:19.775
Um..

10:21.620 --> 10:24.111
Hey, talk to me.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.747
I didn't come here
as a police officer.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.718
I thought the shorts
would've been a giveaway.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.321
What's going on?

10:32.330 --> 10:35.094
Are you feeling threatened
because Alison's husband

10:35.100 --> 10:36.522
is still at large?
We're gonna find him.

10:36.530 --> 10:38.395
No, it's not that. It's..

10:39.700 --> 10:41.361
Then what is it?

10:41.370 --> 10:42.894
[sighs]

10:42.900 --> 10:45.130
Are you still looking
for Mary Drake?

10:45.140 --> 10:46.960
Why?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.801
Would you consider
making that a top priority?

10:49.810 --> 10:51.971
Have you heard from this person?

10:55.320 --> 10:58.778
I, um...I found something

10:58.790 --> 11:00.348
'in my house.‘

11:03.490 --> 11:06.288
She wrote it a long time ago..

11:06.290 --> 11:08.394
...when she was
at Radley Sanitarium.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.664
It was addressed to me..

11:15.840 --> 11:18.229
...before I was born.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.310
[indistinct chatter]

11:52.470 --> 11:55.405
To this place to my heart..

11:55.410 --> 11:58.470
Hey. You wanna take a break?
Maybe get some lunch..

11:58.480 --> 12:00.448
...outside of this room?

12:01.620 --> 12:03.611
- Hanna?
- What?

12:03.620 --> 12:07.215
- You're obsessing.
- I'm working.

12:07.220 --> 12:10.553
Look, I'm the last one
to side with Mona.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.881
- Don't.
- She has a point.

12:12.890 --> 12:14.152
If this client
loves your design—-

12:14.160 --> 12:17.459
No, it's no mine.
Totally, I mean..

12:17.470 --> 12:19.665
I designed this
when I was working for Claudia.

12:19.670 --> 12:20.921
I showed her and she gagged

12:20.940 --> 12:23.033
and then she gave me, like,
20 suggestions.

12:25.740 --> 12:27.560
Well, how many of them
did you take?

12:27.580 --> 12:28.979
[sighs]
Nineteen.

12:28.980 --> 12:30.902
The beading, the belt,
the collar.

12:30.910 --> 12:33.970
Hanna, Claudia Greco
was a dragon.

12:33.980 --> 12:35.743
She stole your soul
for three years

12:35.750 --> 12:37.149
not to mention our relationship.

12:37.150 --> 12:39.584
I mean, the least that she could
give you was a belt.

12:39.590 --> 12:41.182
The belt makes the dress.

12:41.190 --> 12:43.249
If I lose the belt,
I have nothing!

12:43.260 --> 12:45.455
What do I have?
I have a hippie ballet costume.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.223
It's like the Sugar Plum Fairy
meets the Grateful Dead.

12:47.230 --> 12:50.199
That's what Claudia said,
and she was right.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.690
Hey.

12:51.700 --> 12:53.190
Can I just say one last thing?

12:55.640 --> 12:58.461
If you believed in your talent
half as much as I do

12:58.470 --> 13:01.405
you would see this moment
for what it is.

13:01.410 --> 13:03.901
Take it and run.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.275
But I'm stuck

13:05.280 --> 13:11.412
Back on the love
that we had

13:13.890 --> 13:15.289
(Addison)
'Ms. McCullers?‘

13:16.530 --> 13:18.680
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure.

13:18.690 --> 13:20.954
What is this about?

13:22.600 --> 13:24.192
I..

13:24.200 --> 13:26.919
I was gonna go
to Principal Hackett.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.498
But I thought..

13:28.500 --> 13:31.389
I thought it may be better
to talk to you..

13:31.410 --> 13:32.536
...first.

13:33.510 --> 13:35.808
Have a seat.

13:43.550 --> 13:47.338
You heard I was benched
for skipping practice, right?

13:48.920 --> 13:51.388
Well, there's a reason
I wasn't here.

13:52.260 --> 13:54.125
I..

13:55.230 --> 13:57.824
I'm just not comfortable
with this new coach.

13:58.930 --> 14:01.831
And now I think I'm being
punished 'cause I..

14:03.940 --> 14:06.761
...I didn't respond
the way she wanted me to.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.907
Respond to what?

14:10.250 --> 14:13.606
Why do you think
you're being punished, Addison?

14:13.620 --> 14:17.010
She, Coach Fields..

14:17.020 --> 14:19.614
Ever since she got here,
she's been

14:19.620 --> 14:21.952
really inappropriate.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.087
Can you define inappropriate?

14:24.090 --> 14:27.025
I've caught her
staring at me while I changed

14:27.030 --> 14:29.248
when I was in the shower,
in the bathroom mirror.

14:29.260 --> 14:31.251
- Addison..
- She gets too close.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.990
And touchy, and it's not just me

14:35.000 --> 14:37.434
Chelsea Lopez
is freaked out too.

14:37.440 --> 14:40.762
I took a picture
at last Saturday's meet.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.475
I'll show you.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.677
She's always brushing her hand
up against Chelsea's thigh.

14:45.680 --> 14:49.275
Always? That was
Coach Fields' first meet.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.987
I-I don't know why I can't find
it, but if you saw this photo

14:51.990 --> 14:55.016
you'd understand
why everyone's so uncomfortable.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.386
So you think
it's the whole team?

14:58.230 --> 15:00.186
I can't speak for everyone

15:00.200 --> 15:03.749
but here...look at this.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.421
'She's even inappropriate
with other teachers.‘

15:07.870 --> 15:11.590
I'm not saying she's like
a predator, but..

15:11.610 --> 15:14.659
...she's definitely someone
who's way over the line.

15:17.510 --> 15:19.375
If you think I should go
straight to Mr. Hackett--

15:19.380 --> 15:21.644
You did the right thing
coming to me.

15:21.650 --> 15:23.072
I'll handle it.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.616
Can you forward this
to me, please.

15:27.990 --> 15:30.356
So when did
she come up with this?

15:30.360 --> 15:32.521
She's a bride. They're
allowed to change their minds

15:32.530 --> 15:33.929
ten times a day.

15:33.930 --> 15:35.921
So how many guests?

15:35.930 --> 15:37.818
Tomorrow night's
rehearsal dinner for 20

15:37.830 --> 15:40.264
is now a feast for 40.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.329
They're multiplying
like rabbits.

15:42.340 --> 15:44.592
Okay. Well, what can I do?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.908
No, you're not here to help me.

15:46.910 --> 15:49.936
You're supposed to be
working on your menu.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.441
- You need help.
- No, I don't.

15:53.450 --> 15:55.372
Yes, I do.
How are you with tabbouleh?

15:56.280 --> 15:58.441
Bulgur's there, parsley's done.

15:58.450 --> 16:00.179
Tomatoes just need
to be chopped.

16:00.190 --> 16:01.839
Can I trust you with a knife?

16:01.860 --> 16:03.953
Well, not that one.
It's bigger than me.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.155
Alright. Use this.

16:07.430 --> 16:08.624
And put on an apron.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.678
Ezra's still in New York?

16:25.680 --> 16:29.639
Yeah, her family found
a small apartment

16:29.650 --> 16:31.311
for him near the clinic.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.947
Sweet.

16:32.950 --> 16:36.556
Yeah. Sweet.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.688
Can I just say one more thing
that's like really bugging me?

16:39.690 --> 16:42.420
Besides the fact that you
can't say Nicole's name?

16:42.430 --> 16:46.526
I can. _
I just don't really like to.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.794
So what else bugs you?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.097
Besides her name and

16:50.110 --> 16:52.135
a jackass reporter
who didn't do his homework?

16:52.140 --> 16:54.904
I mean, where did he
even read that?

16:54.910 --> 16:57.003
Did Ezra propose to her first?

16:57.010 --> 16:59.444
Y-you wrote a book with the guy.

16:59.450 --> 17:02.510
You've known him forever.
Why would he keep that a secret?

17:02.520 --> 17:04.078
Don't you think
he would have told you?

17:04.090 --> 17:06.479
Why would he? She was gone.

17:06.490 --> 17:09.709
Well, I don't see why it matters
now. You've got the ring.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.711
So why does he keep
putting it off?

17:11.730 --> 17:14.483
She still doesn't even know
that we're engaged.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.958
Is Ezra the only person who's
ever told you he loved you?

17:17.970 --> 17:19.221
What?

17:19.230 --> 17:22.438
In all these years,
was there anyone else..

17:22.440 --> 17:26.160
...in college, after college,
when you moved to Boston?

17:26.170 --> 17:28.730
Well, yeah.

17:28.740 --> 17:30.935
But what does that
have to do with this?

17:30.950 --> 17:33.009
Have you shared that with Ezra?

17:33.010 --> 17:36.309
- That's totally different.
- Why?

17:36.320 --> 17:37.719
Everyone's got history.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.984
Just 'cause you met him
when you were in 11th grade

17:39.990 --> 17:42.686
doesn't mean
he's frozen In amber.

17:42.690 --> 17:46.478
Hey, I'm not the same person
I was in high school.

17:46.490 --> 17:48.720
Are you?

17:51.830 --> 17:53.320
(Emily)
You've gotta be joking.

17:53.330 --> 17:55.560
I mean, this kid
is out of control.

17:55.570 --> 17:57.834
- I'm gonna go talk to Hackett.
- Emily, wait, before you do—-

17:57.840 --> 17:59.205
No, why wait?
The girl's a snake.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.837
She needs to be
kicked off the team.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.479
I agree, but she is dangerous.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.608
Why? Because she snapped a pic
of me taking care of a friend?

18:06.610 --> 18:08.817
Hackett knows what Alison
and I have been through.

18:08.820 --> 18:10.048
Everyone in this town does.

18:10.050 --> 18:11.312
No one's gonna let her
subvert a hug into-—

18:11.320 --> 18:12.787
It's not about that picture.

18:12.790 --> 18:14.485
She's accused you
of hitting on her.

18:14.490 --> 18:15.912
- Oh, my God.
- And others.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.251
And who's gonna believe that?

18:17.260 --> 18:18.784
It's your word against hers.

18:18.790 --> 18:20.553
And if she strong-arms
any of her other teammates

18:20.560 --> 18:21.925
and files a formal complaint--

18:21.930 --> 18:24.194
Okay. I'll let Hackett
handle this.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.020
I mean, if I confront the kid,
it'll be worse.

18:26.030 --> 18:27.622
Like I do have
something to hide.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.359
And if you challenge her, she'll
turn you into a predator too.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.203
I don't think so. She doesn't
have any pictures of me.

18:34.940 --> 18:36.430
What's that supposed to mean?

18:36.440 --> 18:38.203
I'm just saying
you need to be careful.

18:38.210 --> 18:39.746
Alison brings her drama
to school

18:39.750 --> 18:40.739
it's easy to get sucked in--

18:40.750 --> 18:42.547
Okay, this has nothing
to do with Alison.

18:42.550 --> 18:45.246
This is about a vile brat who's
determined to take down an adult

18:45.250 --> 18:47.548
that dared to discipline her.
She's a bully.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.017
I won't let her get away
with this.

18:50.020 --> 18:51.578
How do you plan to stop her?

18:51.590 --> 18:54.582
Let me supervise practice today.
You take the night off.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.693
I'll talk to some
of the other teammates

18:56.700 --> 18:58.622
put out any fires
before they spread.

19:03.540 --> 19:07.032
She checked into this motel
last Tuesday.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.359
She didn't sign in
under Mary Drake

19:08.380 --> 19:10.530
but matches_ _
the character description.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.905
Did you talk to anybody?
Any idea where she was headed?

19:12.910 --> 19:15.447
No. There's a lead
out of Scranton.

19:15.450 --> 19:18.248
Two Mary Drakes listed
as permanent residents.

19:18.250 --> 19:19.683
Well, do you have any photos?

19:19.690 --> 19:22.989
Well, they both appear
to have been born before 1950.

19:22.990 --> 19:24.412
[sighs]

19:25.760 --> 19:27.250
Hey..

19:27.260 --> 19:28.852
...you sure
you really want this?

19:30.770 --> 19:33.921
You've seen some
gruesome stuff, Spencer.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.067
And this person could've been
the one who pulled the trigger.

19:36.070 --> 19:37.765
She wasn't, she..

19:39.070 --> 19:40.901
I don't see her
that way anymore.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.875
Where did you find it
in the house? The letter.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.171
Your parents hung on to it.

19:49.180 --> 19:52.513
They might still know
where to contact her.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.281
[walking stick tapping]

19:59.260 --> 20:01.820
[intense music]

20:08.840 --> 20:11.638
Detective Furey, I believe
you've been looking for me?

20:12.740 --> 20:14.833
- I'm J-—
- I know who you are.

20:16.380 --> 20:18.530
- Where have you been?
- Hiding.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.815
But I can't do that anymore.

20:24.020 --> 20:25.840
I need to tell somebody
the truth.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.614
We're not alone right now,
Ms. Marshall.

20:28.620 --> 20:31.316
I know. I can hear her breathe.

20:33.660 --> 20:34.854
Hello, Spencer.

20:43.470 --> 20:45.461
Are you sure he's dead?

20:45.470 --> 20:48.030
If you're referring
to Noel Kahn, yes.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.076
But if you'd like
to make a statement, Jenna

20:50.080 --> 20:51.206
I'd recommend you--

20:51.210 --> 20:52.370
He wasn't just out to get you

20:52.380 --> 20:53.745
and your friend, Spencer.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.672
- He wanted to kill me too.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.887
Sara Harvey was first.
I was next.

21:02.860 --> 21:05.249
What do you know
about Sara Harvey's death?

21:05.260 --> 21:06.989
There were no accidents
with Noel.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.858
He was a sociopath who knew
exactly how to trap you.

21:11.870 --> 21:12.996
[chuckles]

21:13.000 --> 21:15.560
He kept telling me
that some of the money

21:15.570 --> 21:19.336
that Charlotte_left behind
was mine.

21:19.340 --> 21:24.835
She promised to pay
for another surgery for my eyes.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.978
So he recruited me
for that treasure hunt

21:27.980 --> 21:30.574
because he thought
I had the answers.

21:30.590 --> 21:34.185
He only wanted the money
for himself.

21:34.190 --> 21:36.181
Why would he need money?
His parents--

21:36.190 --> 21:38.511
They cut him off.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.851
Noel was broke.

21:40.860 --> 21:42.293
And he wasn't gonna
share it with anyone

21:42.300 --> 21:45.349
so he lured me in
to my old school

21:45.370 --> 21:48.897
so that he could
get rid of me too.

21:48.900 --> 21:51.061
I had to play along..

21:51.070 --> 21:53.209
...and act like his partner.

21:53.210 --> 21:55.804
Are you implying that
he put that gun in your hand?

21:55.810 --> 21:59.803
No. I brought it
to protect myself.

21:59.810 --> 22:02.449
But everything I said to you
and your friend, Spencer

22:02.450 --> 22:04.771
was for Noel's benefit, so..

22:08.020 --> 22:09.419
...so I could..

22:11.630 --> 22:13.052
...make it out alive.

22:13.060 --> 22:14.288
Oh, my God. You're so full--

22:14.300 --> 22:16.598
You don't need
to comment on this.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.022
[sighs]

22:18.030 --> 22:19.497
Kevin?

22:21.040 --> 22:23.361
Could you take Ms. Marshall
to the conference room?

22:27.180 --> 22:28.602
I'll join you shortly.

22:32.180 --> 22:33.340
Do you wanna see
a real sociopath?

22:33.350 --> 22:34.476
Because you have one walking

22:34.480 --> 22:35.674
into your conference room
right now.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.648
Spencer,
the bullet that hit you

22:37.650 --> 22:39.186
did not match the gun
that Jenna was holding.

22:39.190 --> 22:40.487
And we have
plenty of evidence

22:40.490 --> 22:41.980
that will support
her assessment of Noel Kahn.

22:41.990 --> 22:44.857
She is worse than he is. You
have to lock her up right now!

22:44.860 --> 22:48.023
We cannot charge her
with anything formally yet.

22:48.030 --> 22:49.759
[panﬂng]

22:49.760 --> 22:51.625
Unless there's something
you're not telling me.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.939
Hello, is anyone there?

22:55.940 --> 22:57.828
(female #1)
'Hello, may I help you?‘

22:57.840 --> 23:00.058
I'm still holding for Claudia.

23:00.070 --> 23:01.469
(female #1)
'May I have your name please?‘

23:01.480 --> 23:03.471
I've left three messages.

23:04.110 --> 23:05.805
Hanna Marin.

23:05.810 --> 23:07.277
(female #1)
'I'm sorry.
Could you repeat that please?‘

23:07.280 --> 23:08.941
Marin.

23:08.950 --> 23:10.611
Look, you're sitting
at my old desk

23:10.620 --> 23:12.042
if she doesn't wanna talk
to me, then..

23:12.050 --> 23:13.483
[phone disconnects]

23:14.320 --> 23:16.754
Hello?

How could she just
walk in there?

23:31.470 --> 23:33.700
I'll tell you how,
because she has balls

23:33.710 --> 23:35.007
the size of church bells.

23:35.010 --> 23:36.773
Okay. Well, I didn't need
that image.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.146
Why didn't he just ask her who
was shooting off the second gun?

23:39.150 --> 23:41.368
I'm sure he will,
but he couldn't do that

23:41.380 --> 23:43.814
in front of you.

23:43.820 --> 23:45.071
Do you know how hard it was not
to tell him

23:45.090 --> 23:46.512
about that freakin' game?

23:46.520 --> 23:48.511
Why were you even down there?
At the precinct?

23:49.220 --> 23:51.017
These are really good.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.827
Okay. Stop eating those.

23:52.830 --> 23:54.650
Holden had to drive
all the way to Amish country

23:54.660 --> 23:56.321
to get these mushrooms.

23:56.330 --> 23:58.389
- Yeah, where is he?
- Tomato run.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.697
He'll be back soon
so talk fast.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.396
Why were you in Furey's office?

24:02.400 --> 24:04.436
Because he's helping me
find her..

24:04.440 --> 24:06.499
...Mary.

24:06.510 --> 24:09.138
Are you sure that's a good idea?

24:09.140 --> 24:13.179
I mean, if you saw her again,
what are you gonna say?

24:13.180 --> 24:17.947
I'm not sure. I guess, um..

24:17.950 --> 24:20.282
I'm still trying to
figure out things about me

24:20.290 --> 24:22.679
that have never made sense.

24:22.690 --> 24:26.057
It might make sense
if I could just..

24:26.060 --> 24:27.584
...get to know her.

24:27.600 --> 24:31.889
You know, not as someone
to fear, but..

24:31.900 --> 24:33.197
...to forgive.

24:39.710 --> 24:42.099
I tried calling Spence.
She won't pick up.

24:42.110 --> 24:44.203
(Hanna)
'No one's taking
my calls today.‘

24:44.210 --> 24:45.871
Wait, so who was hiding Jenna?

24:45.880 --> 24:48.872
Sydney What's-Her-Face?
Was she at the station too?

24:48.880 --> 24:50.438
I got the same text
as you, Hanna

24:50.450 --> 24:51.872
didn't come
with the footnotes.

24:51.890 --> 24:55.018
Don't bite me.
I was just asking.

24:55.020 --> 24:58.183
Look, I'm sorry. I guess she's
been to seventh circle of hell

24:58.190 --> 25:00.021
and just keeps getting..

25:06.800 --> 25:10.588
Yes, and so is Jenna
with bookends.

25:11.410 --> 25:13.298
I'll call you back.

25:13.310 --> 25:14.709
[scoffs]

25:18.110 --> 25:19.270
Send.

25:24.420 --> 25:25.773
[cell phone beeps]

25:46.370 --> 25:48.008
Oh, there you are.

25:48.010 --> 25:49.637
I thought maybe you decided
not to come after--

25:49.640 --> 25:53.303
No, I was just with Aria.
I'm ready.

25:53.310 --> 25:55.778
Gil faxed over a blueprint.

25:55.780 --> 25:57.839
It's a nice place.

25:57.850 --> 26:00.978
But he said that the corner's
loud, lots of traffic.

26:00.990 --> 26:03.083
'Maybe if I took the backroom'

26:03.090 --> 26:04.785
'and we put your desk
outside my office--'

26:04.790 --> 26:08.351
I won't be needing a desk.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.523
Uh, I promised you that
I would help you get settled

26:11.530 --> 26:13.088
and I will.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.193
But I'm gonna be looking
for other work.

26:16.170 --> 26:17.398
I have to.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.662
[cell phone rings]

26:19.670 --> 26:22.468
If that's dad, just take it.
I'll wait in the car.

26:22.480 --> 26:26.177
No, it's not your father.

26:26.180 --> 26:28.239
It's, uh, it's a realtor.

26:30.150 --> 26:32.345
Your dad and I have decided
to sell this house.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.547
What? When?

26:35.560 --> 26:37.289
We figured
the sooner the better.

26:37.290 --> 26:41.852
Severing ties with this town
would be healthy for all of us.

26:43.130 --> 26:45.894
I didn't tell you this morning
because I..

26:45.900 --> 26:47.765
I knew that you were already
hurting, and I didn't want to--

26:47.770 --> 26:51.228
Sell it! Fine,
do what's best for you guys.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.038
- It's just a house.
- No, it's not.

26:55.610 --> 26:57.669
It's our home.
It's-it's your home.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.874
It's the only home
you've ever known.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.201
Well, it feels different now.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.915
Not to me.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.514
Spencer, it's not about walls
and a roof

27:05.520 --> 27:08.842
and-and a staircase,
it's about a family..

27:08.860 --> 27:10.282
...that lived here.

27:12.190 --> 27:13.851
A family that I've tried
to hold together

27:13.860 --> 27:17.751
in spite of all the lies
and losses and crap

27:17.770 --> 27:19.397
that life's thrown at us.

27:20.530 --> 27:22.634
My children made even

27:22.640 --> 27:24.335
the worst moments bearable.

27:26.070 --> 27:28.038
We got through them together,
not because

27:28.040 --> 27:30.702
we have the same blood
flowing through our veins

27:30.710 --> 27:32.644
but because we're a family.

27:34.350 --> 27:38.241
All I ever wanted to do
was to make you feel safe

27:38.250 --> 27:39.410
and nurtured and..

27:41.190 --> 27:42.384
...and loved.

27:44.060 --> 27:45.982
That's what made it
a home for me.

27:52.470 --> 27:55.428
We should probably go.

- What?

'Oh, yeah.'

- Sorry, I forgot to eat lunch.
- No worries.

Uh, no. I—I should get going.

28:41.880 --> 28:44.246
I'll talk to you tomorrow?

Oh, we never got around
to discussing the menu

28:45.950 --> 28:47.110
for you and Ezra.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.883
Yeah. That's okay. Next time.

lick this.

wear the same srze.

- Yeah.

in Philly.

is gonna find out. Now.

You don't have_ to introduce me
to your little posse.

29:46.310 --> 29:48.039
Just tell me
where you got the dress?

29:48.050 --> 29:50.575
- Excuse me?
- The dress.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.787
Where did it come from?

29:52.790 --> 29:54.678
- It was a gift.
- From who?

29:54.690 --> 29:58.012
That was Hanna. This is me.
Who gave you the dress?

29:58.030 --> 30:00.021
I'm sorry,
I can't talk right now.

30:00.030 --> 30:03.329
We have an Uber waiting
for us. Bye.

30:03.330 --> 30:04.524

30:05.870 --> 30:07.724
I thought the police
were looking for her.

30:07.740 --> 30:09.059
What is she doing
shuffling around in that

30:09.070 --> 30:10.799
instead of an orange jumpsuit?

30:10.810 --> 30:12.459
[sighs]
It's all part of the game.

30:12.470 --> 30:13.539
What game?

30:14.780 --> 30:16.532
Hanna, what game
are we talking about?

30:16.540 --> 30:18.770
You know what?
I can't do this right now.

30:18.780 --> 30:20.077
Later.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.770
I thought you had
a spare key.

30:22.780 --> 30:23.849
What's going on?

30:23.850 --> 30:24.919
Spencer's in Philly
with her mom

30:24.920 --> 30:26.182
and I need to get into
that barn.

30:26.190 --> 30:27.714
- Why?
- That nasty little mean girl

30:27.720 --> 30:29.142
in your class is a pawn. Okay?

30:29.160 --> 30:31.116
Another Sydney deployed
by Jenna to destroy me.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.188
- Hold on.
- No.

30:32.190 --> 30:33.452
I need to see that board game.

30:33.460 --> 30:35.189
If AD. is behind this
and is threatening me

30:35.200 --> 30:37.919
to play that game, then I want
some confirmation. Something.

30:37.930 --> 30:40.160
Em, I don't think
it takes questions.

30:40.170 --> 30:41.523
It's not a Ouija board.

30:41.540 --> 30:42.768
Addison Derringer is making

30:42.770 --> 30:44.089
some very serious allegations

30:44.100 --> 30:45.965
about me being inappropriate.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.369
And if this is all
about breaking me down

30:47.370 --> 30:48.906
so I have to admit other things
to Hackett--

30:48.910 --> 30:50.571
Wait. What other things?

30:50.580 --> 30:52.377

30:52.380 --> 30:54.974
I_took a shortcut
to getting my degree, okay?

30:54.980 --> 30:58.245
I-I missed a final exam,
and AD. took it for me.

30:58.250 --> 30:59.615
So you already played the game?

30:59.620 --> 31:01.212
No, it wasn't a game back then.

31:01.220 --> 31:02.380
But I'm pretty sure
that Jenna Marshall

31:02.390 --> 31:04.756
was the mastermind
behind that one too.

31:04.760 --> 31:06.284
Where is the damn key?

31:06.290 --> 31:07.951
Em, if you roll the dice again,
you're basically

31:07.960 --> 31:09.689
taking all of us with you.

31:09.700 --> 31:10.894
I'm living proof.

31:10.900 --> 31:12.094
Once you invite the devil in

31:12.100 --> 31:14.364
a horde of little seeds
start to sprout.

31:14.370 --> 31:16.065
Please.

You're not doing this alone.

31:35.190 --> 31:37.988
[indistinct chatter]

31:42.430 --> 31:44.898
(Hanna)
'1 don't believe it.
Tenerelli's in that building'

31:44.900 --> 31:46.788
- Who's Tenerelli?
- The cobbler.

31:46.800 --> 31:47.960
The old man
who's repairing my shoes.

31:47.970 --> 31:49.995
She's gonna steal my shoes too.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.764
- Hanna, stop. Let me do this.
- Do what?

31:52.770 --> 31:55.102
I don't need help ripping
the dress off her back.

31:56.980 --> 31:59.335
She's not even going inside.
Only they are.

32:02.150 --> 32:04.209
You stay here.
I'm gonna handle Jenna.

32:04.220 --> 32:06.017
We need answers, not a brawl.

32:14.860 --> 32:17.988
Yes. Yes.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.696
Uh, yeah, maybe.
I will, I will try, okay?

32:24.040 --> 32:26.531
Hanna, is that you?

32:26.540 --> 32:29.839
Close. Guess again.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.637
I don't have to.

32:31.650 --> 32:34.005
Her smell clings to you.

32:34.010 --> 32:35.705
What are you doing here, Jenna?

32:35.720 --> 32:37.073
I'm meeting friends
to rehearse.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.275
- Rehearse for what?
- A concert.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.087
In a shoe repair shop?

32:41.090 --> 32:44.685
[chuckles]
There's a studio
on the top floor.

32:44.690 --> 32:46.578
And my friends are waiting, 50..

32:46.590 --> 32:49.354
Yeah, I saw your friends. They
didn't have any instruments.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.794
Unless they're the kind
that you pack in holsters.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.859
Caleb, I suggest you back off.

32:53.870 --> 32:56.395
Hm. That's my suggestion.

32:57.770 --> 33:00.034
Who brought you back
to Rosewood this time?

33:00.040 --> 33:01.837
Why do you assume
I didn't come alone?

33:01.840 --> 33:04.035
Because you couldn't make
a dress from a stolen sketch

33:04.040 --> 33:05.337
without a little help.

33:08.380 --> 33:11.213
You better think twice about why
you came back to town, Jenna.

33:11.220 --> 33:12.676
The cops are already
punching holes

33:12.690 --> 33:15.716
in that little bedtime story
about you and Noel.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.051
Well, they shouldn't.

33:17.060 --> 33:19.551
Because the last time I checked,
the only person

33:19.560 --> 33:23.326
who could contradict
that story was dead.

33:29.970 --> 33:32.598
[door creaking]

33:33.910 --> 33:35.605
Mr. Tenerelli, are you here?

33:56.030 --> 33:58.624
Mr. Tenerelli, are you in here?

34:05.740 --> 34:07.765
[thuds]

34:07.780 --> 34:09.463
Mr. Tenerelli, is that you?

34:10.840 --> 34:12.239
[gaSPS]

34:18.290 --> 34:20.815
(Emily)
'Was that piece over there the
last time we looked at this?‘

34:29.130 --> 34:31.394
Do it. Or I will.

34:34.540 --> 34:38.294
What is that?
A security footage?

34:38.310 --> 34:41.063
Looks like the alley
behind The Brew.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.536
Who's that in the car?

34:43.880 --> 34:45.472
(Alison)
'That would be Addison.‘

34:45.480 --> 34:47.675
(Emily)
And her boyfriend.

34:47.680 --> 34:49.238
Look at the time code.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.514
'Isn't that when
she was too sick for practice?‘

35:07.600 --> 35:08.794
[sighs]

35:12.240 --> 35:14.060
Excuse me.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.560
- Hello_. Hi.
- Hi.

35:15.580 --> 35:18.378
- Do they lock the doors?
- 7:00.

35:18.380 --> 35:20.541
Visiting hours are over at 7:00.

35:20.550 --> 35:21.699
Really?

35:21.720 --> 35:23.915
[sighs]
Could've sworn they said 8:00.

35:23.920 --> 35:26.616
No. It's always been 7:00.

35:26.620 --> 35:27.746
Hm.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.987
[scoffs]
I knew this was crazy.

35:30.990 --> 35:34.187
My friend, she's a patient here,
she was really craving

35:34.190 --> 35:36.693
salt water taffy,
so I ran out to get it

35:36.700 --> 35:38.429
and I knew I wasn't gonna make
it back in time.

35:38.430 --> 35:40.364
I got stuck
in this horrible traffic.

35:40.370 --> 35:44.067
- Who's the patient?
- Nicole Gordon.

35:44.070 --> 35:47.062
Um, I-I think she's in room--

35:47.070 --> 35:49.903
- 317.
- That's right.

35:49.910 --> 35:51.400
317, yes.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.378
Just give her the bag
and make it quick.

35:53.380 --> 35:56.838
And don't tell anyone
that I'm gonna let you in.

35:56.850 --> 35:59.478
It's gonna cost you
more than a bag of candy.

36:00.890 --> 36:02.141
(Holden)
'Aria!‘

36:03.990 --> 36:05.412
Don't do it.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.658
(Hanna)
Caleb?

36:10.860 --> 36:13.055
Caleb? Help!

36:13.070 --> 36:14.867
Someone, please, open the door.

36:14.870 --> 36:17.464
[machinery whirring]

36:19.070 --> 36:20.435
[whirring]

36:26.010 --> 36:27.238
Oh!

36:27.250 --> 36:29.343
Helo me. Stop.

36:29.350 --> 36:30.908
'Mr. Tenerelli.‘

36:43.300 --> 36:45.894
[cell phone beeping]

36:53.710 --> 36:54.859
(Caleb)
'Hanna?

36:57.980 --> 36:59.231
Hanna?

37:03.050 --> 37:04.472
Hanna!

37:06.920 --> 37:07.989
What happened?

37:16.900 --> 37:18.299
[grunts]

37:18.300 --> 37:20.268
Hanna, you alright?

37:22.670 --> 37:26.197
You okay?

37:26.210 --> 37:29.008
[breathing heavily]

37:35.750 --> 37:39.675
Hey, Carly, would you mind
giving us a moment? Thanks.

37:41.990 --> 37:43.457
We need to talk.

37:43.460 --> 37:44.757
What is this about?

37:44.760 --> 37:46.751
This is about you,
and where you were yesterday

37:46.760 --> 37:48.489
when you were supposed
to be here.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.389
And what you're willing to do
to protect a lie.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.799
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.792
Yeah, you do. You know exactly
how dangerous you are.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.734
And if you don't retract
those accusations

37:57.740 --> 37:59.662
then I'll have to share
some pretty damaging evidence

37:59.670 --> 38:03.401
about your extracurricular
activities behind The Brew.

38:03.410 --> 38:06.299
So now you're following me too?

38:06.310 --> 38:09.575
Maybe you wanna use your time
more wisely, Coach Fields.

38:09.580 --> 38:12.344
- Like finding a lawyer.
- Stop it, Addison.

38:12.350 --> 38:13.886
You will not have the last word.

38:13.890 --> 38:16.609
- Why, you're gonna smack me?
- No, I can't do that.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.554
But somebody should have
a long time ago.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.983
Probably some poor kid who got
off the bus three stops early

38:20.990 --> 38:22.981
because they couldn't deal
with your dirty looks

38:23.000 --> 38:25.355
or the sounds of your snickering
two rows behind them.

38:25.370 --> 38:27.622
You wanna know _
what's inappropriate, Addison?

38:27.630 --> 38:29.518
You. You're inappropriate!

38:29.540 --> 38:31.462
And you need to be stopped
because I was that kid

38:31.470 --> 38:32.960
on the bus,
and I will not let you--

38:32.970 --> 38:34.562
(Paige)
Emily?'

38:35.780 --> 38:37.407
I thought you weren't
coming tonight?

38:37.410 --> 38:39.469
'You got another obligation.
Remember?‘

38:39.480 --> 38:41.698
What was that,
stalking another student?

38:41.720 --> 38:45.315
Addison, save your breath
for the principal.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.878
He was just forwarded a copy
of an e—mail

38:46.890 --> 38:48.846
you sent to a friend
in computer lab.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.613
Gloating about how you were
getting rid of Coach Fields.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.825
- I never sent--
- Save it, Addison.

38:53.830 --> 38:55.457
It was also sent
to your parents.

38:55.460 --> 38:57.394
Your dad's in my office.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.049
Here's a copy to refresh
your memory.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.365
Come on. Your dad's waiting.

39:20.190 --> 39:22.488
I can't believe
you followed me here.

39:22.490 --> 39:25.789
I didn't want you
to make another mistake.

39:25.790 --> 39:29.954
The road to every altar
is paved with bad decisions.

39:31.530 --> 39:34.021
Do you think I should give
the ring back?

39:34.030 --> 39:36.760
What? God, no.

39:36.770 --> 39:39.762
I think you should stare
at that diamond real hard

39:39.770 --> 39:43.979
and think how long it took for
a lump of carbon to become that.

39:43.980 --> 39:46.005
I mean, it's like..

39:46.010 --> 39:48.604
...a million years plus.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.645
Talk about patience.

39:52.790 --> 39:56.783
You can't expect him
to be on your timetable, Aria.

39:56.790 --> 40:01.625
If the man needs another week
or two, give it to him.

40:01.630 --> 40:04.394
He's probably more torn up
inside than you.

40:07.300 --> 40:09.359
[sighs]

40:09.370 --> 40:10.769
Thank you.

40:12.310 --> 40:13.607
No sweat.

40:15.410 --> 40:18.129
Try the pizza. It's good.

40:19.310 --> 40:21.073
It's not as good as mine, but..

40:33.330 --> 40:36.754
Hey. You ready?

40:36.760 --> 40:37.920
Yeah.

40:37.930 --> 40:39.557
Let me get my stuff,
I'll give you a ride.

40:51.610 --> 40:54.204
[dramatic music]

40:56.920 --> 40:58.444
(Paige) .
'Emily, you ready?

40:58.450 --> 40:59.872
Coming.

41:03.360 --> 41:06.215
[cell phone ringing]

41:18.970 --> 41:20.460
(Aria)
'Em, I don't get it.'

41:20.470 --> 41:22.734
'What did you have to do
to get this piece?‘

41:22.740 --> 41:25.709
Jenna reduced her to
blackmailing a tenth grader.

41:25.710 --> 41:27.177
Well, you got off easy.

41:27.180 --> 41:30.570
One of her goons tried to grind
my hand into a moccasin.

41:30.580 --> 41:32.138
Is that a map?

41:32.150 --> 41:33.788
- What?
- Look.

41:33.790 --> 41:35.610
That dark area
is shaped like Rosewood

41:35.620 --> 41:37.258
'and then these three lines
are the three roads'

41:37.260 --> 41:39.717
that lead out of it, this one
curves just like Route 37

41:39.730 --> 41:41.948
and this long slanted one
leads to the turnpike.

41:41.960 --> 41:44.349
- Why are we getting a map?
- Seriously.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.999
It's not like this game wants
to help us escape.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.163
No, but maybe it wants us
to find something.

41:50.170 --> 41:51.592
Or someone.

41:51.610 --> 41:54.204
[intense music]

42:12.590 --> 42:15.787
[theme music]
