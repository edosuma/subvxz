WEBVTT

00:09.128 --> 00:12.461
(soft foreboding music)

00:16.796 --> 00:19.382
- [Man] I had a really
good time with you tonight.

00:19.382 --> 00:21.439
- [Woman] Me too.

00:21.439 --> 00:22.794
- [Man] I'll see you tomorrow?

00:22.794 --> 00:24.080
- Yeah.
(man chuckling softly)

00:24.080 --> 00:25.997
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

00:44.579 --> 00:46.829
- No, no, no, no, no, fuck!

00:49.530 --> 00:51.225
What the fuck?

00:51.225 --> 00:54.558
(dark foreboding music)

01:07.299 --> 01:10.049
(Abby gasping)

01:14.944 --> 01:18.361
(orchestral waltz music)

01:22.225 --> 01:26.150
- Are you sure you don't
wanna cancel this weekend?

01:26.150 --> 01:26.983
- What are you talkin' 'bout?

01:26.983 --> 01:29.251
Why would we cancel?

01:29.251 --> 01:31.282
- My brother just got outta rehab.

01:31.282 --> 01:33.718
Tyler seems depressed or something.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.459
I don't even know the last
time we talked to Margot.

01:35.459 --> 01:37.014
I just feel like we'd have more fun

01:37.014 --> 01:39.181
if it was just you and me.

01:41.158 --> 01:42.911
- C'mon, it's my birthday.

01:42.911 --> 01:44.235
Do you realize it's been almost two years

01:44.235 --> 01:45.959
since the five of us
all hung out together?

01:45.959 --> 01:47.399
It'll be like old times.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.068
(door knocking)

01:49.068 --> 01:50.151
Hey, come in.

01:51.062 --> 01:52.479
Abby's here, hun.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.067
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:58.211 --> 01:59.671
- What's wrong?

01:59.671 --> 02:02.142
- [Abby] (weeps) Oh god, I'm so--

02:02.142 --> 02:04.646
- Abby, you didn't do
anything wrong, okay?

02:04.646 --> 02:06.301
If he was cheating on you, you
should not beat yourself up.

02:06.301 --> 02:09.009
- I didn't say he was cheating.

02:09.009 --> 02:11.870
- I mean, he's got pictures
of girls on his phone.

02:11.870 --> 02:14.787
What's the best-case scenario here?

02:15.664 --> 02:19.537
You should just come with
us, have fun, let loose,

02:19.537 --> 02:22.003
forget about the stress for one weekend.

02:22.003 --> 02:23.798
- And Winston won't mind?

02:23.798 --> 02:24.692
- No, not at all.

02:24.692 --> 02:25.525
Are you kidding?

02:25.525 --> 02:27.192
He'll be thrilled.

02:27.192 --> 02:28.718
- Abby?

02:28.718 --> 02:30.137
Why would Abby come?

02:30.137 --> 02:31.684
- I think it'd be good for her.

02:31.684 --> 02:34.101
Mitch is kind of a douchebag.

02:35.143 --> 02:37.897
- Okay well, it seems like
you're meddling again.

02:37.897 --> 02:38.779
- Again?
- Yeah.

02:38.779 --> 02:40.228
Do you remember that
girl that you catfished

02:40.228 --> 02:42.238
that your brother was dating?

02:42.238 --> 02:44.571
- That girl was white trash.

02:47.344 --> 02:48.177
- But do you remember

02:48.177 --> 02:51.057
when we used to hang out every weekend?

02:51.057 --> 02:55.057
Now all we do is work and
sleep, work and sleep.

02:56.231 --> 02:59.390
I know everyone has stuff goin' on.

02:59.390 --> 03:02.270
I just wanted one weekend where

03:02.270 --> 03:05.531
we could hang out like we used to.

03:05.531 --> 03:06.654
- You're gonna get that, okay?

03:06.654 --> 03:08.265
I'm sure it's gonna be great.

03:08.265 --> 03:09.150
- Promise?

03:09.150 --> 03:09.983
- Yes.

03:11.204 --> 03:12.037
I'll make sure.

03:12.037 --> 03:13.312
- Okay, thank you.

03:13.312 --> 03:14.525
- You're welcome.

03:14.525 --> 03:15.948
(lips smacking)

03:15.948 --> 03:17.178
- [Margot] Hey, it's Margot.

03:17.178 --> 03:18.011
You know what to do.

03:18.011 --> 03:19.696
- Hey, it's Winston.

03:19.696 --> 03:21.443
I haven't heard from you,

03:21.443 --> 03:23.449
but I'm just gonna text you the address

03:23.449 --> 03:25.034
and hope to see you there.

03:25.034 --> 03:26.107
- Look, don't let him force you.

03:26.107 --> 03:27.765
This is typical Winston bullshit.

03:27.765 --> 03:29.171
- I'm not letting him force me.

03:29.171 --> 03:30.292
It could be fun.

03:30.292 --> 03:33.450
And it might be nice to you know,

03:33.450 --> 03:35.453
put it behind me after
everything that happened.

03:35.453 --> 03:38.025
Get outta my head for the weekend.

03:38.025 --> 03:39.596
If you don't go,

03:39.596 --> 03:41.632
who am I going to make
sarcastic comments to

03:41.632 --> 03:42.691
all weekend long?

03:42.691 --> 03:43.524
Please.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.954
Please, please, please,
please, please, please.

03:46.954 --> 03:48.079
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Please, please, please.

03:48.079 --> 03:48.938
- Okay, fine.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.411
I will go.

03:50.411 --> 03:52.468
I'm gonna be late.

03:52.468 --> 03:53.968
- You're an angel.

03:56.340 --> 03:57.173
(birds chirping)

03:57.173 --> 03:58.673
- He is not ready.

03:59.886 --> 04:00.719
- You know what?

04:00.719 --> 04:03.496
We probably just need to wait
'til the end of the cartoons.

04:03.496 --> 04:05.917
When the cartoons are done, he'll be done.

04:05.917 --> 04:07.139
- Okay, all right.

04:07.139 --> 04:10.114
Can you please just take it
easy on him this weekend?

04:10.114 --> 04:10.947
- I didn't say anything.

04:10.947 --> 04:13.614
- I know, just give him a break.

04:14.648 --> 04:16.963
Listen, I have something to tell you,

04:16.963 --> 04:18.846
but I don't want you to be mad at me.

04:18.846 --> 04:20.678
- That's a good start.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.333
- Julia invited Abby.

04:24.665 --> 04:25.498
She didn't tell me.

04:25.498 --> 04:26.915
I just found out.

04:28.352 --> 04:29.185
I think its gonna be fun.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.616
I think it's gonna be good for you.

04:30.616 --> 04:32.057
I don't think it's gonna be a problem.

04:32.057 --> 04:33.307
I really don't.

04:35.532 --> 04:36.910
I think it'll be fine.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.077
I honestly do.

04:40.177 --> 04:41.010
Car ride'll be fun.

04:41.010 --> 04:42.949
We could do stuff in
the car that you like.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.366
(orchestral waltz music)

04:47.521 --> 04:48.440
- This fuckin' sucks, dude.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.137
- I know, I'm sorry.

04:50.137 --> 04:51.208
I'm gonna get your bag.

04:51.208 --> 04:56.208
(soft orchestral music)
(birds chirping)

04:58.362 --> 04:59.653
(Winston vocalizing)

04:59.653 --> 05:02.320
- Winston fucking Russo, my man.

05:03.716 --> 05:05.908
(Nate laughing)

05:05.908 --> 05:07.438
Happy birthday.

05:07.438 --> 05:10.605
Gosh dang it, it's so good to see you.

05:12.444 --> 05:14.704
(Nate chuckling)

05:14.704 --> 05:18.037
(soft intriguing music)

05:22.878 --> 05:24.819
- (chuckles softly) Hey.

05:24.819 --> 05:25.765
- Oh.
- I'll get this.

05:25.765 --> 05:27.609
You can get in.
- Hi.

05:27.609 --> 05:28.442
- You can take the outside.

05:28.442 --> 05:29.275
I'll sit in the back.

05:29.275 --> 05:30.108
- Hey bud, you scooch?

05:30.108 --> 05:31.736
- Yeah.
- Scooch a little bit.

05:31.736 --> 05:32.569
Can you move over a little bit?

05:32.569 --> 05:34.201
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.034
- Okay.

05:36.582 --> 05:39.094
Hi. (chuckles softly)

05:39.094 --> 05:41.254
- So did you guys pick a date?

05:41.254 --> 05:42.087
- What?

05:43.267 --> 05:44.100
What?

05:45.630 --> 05:46.689
What?

05:46.689 --> 05:47.659
- Did you guys pick a date?

05:47.659 --> 05:48.742
Sorry.
- What?

05:50.087 --> 05:53.384
- I was just asking about your wedding.

05:53.384 --> 05:55.181
- Oh.
- It's kinda hard to.

05:55.181 --> 05:57.294
- Yeah, no we'll talk later.
(Nate chuckling)

05:57.294 --> 05:58.746
- Hey, check this out.
- For sure.

05:58.746 --> 05:59.591
- Isn't that tight?

05:59.591 --> 06:00.424
- Yeah.

06:00.424 --> 06:02.924
- Dude, look at that.
- So funny.

06:02.924 --> 06:04.892
(soft intriguing music)

06:04.892 --> 06:08.300
- Hmm, I don't have any service out here.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.176
- Yeah it's kinda nice, right?

06:10.176 --> 06:13.089
- Yeah, we're in the middle of the desert.

06:13.089 --> 06:16.005
- It's kind of the point.

06:16.005 --> 06:21.005
(wind whooshing)
(soft intriguing music)

06:43.996 --> 06:47.329
(soft orchestral music)

06:55.571 --> 06:58.071
(crow cawing)

07:02.616 --> 07:04.700
- Here we are, huh?
- Yeah.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.183
- Look at this place.

07:06.183 --> 07:08.657
(crow cawing)

07:08.657 --> 07:11.856
- It says to park outside the
gate, so that's what we'll do.

07:11.856 --> 07:13.920
- [Tyler] We stopped (speaks faintly).

07:13.920 --> 07:14.753
- This is.

07:14.753 --> 07:15.586
C'mon.

07:15.586 --> 07:18.336
(wind whooshing)

07:19.564 --> 07:22.642
- [Tyler] Nate, I think that's
where your bunking (mumbles)

07:22.642 --> 07:24.266
(Tyler drowned out by crow cawing)

07:24.266 --> 07:26.099
- Okay, you take this.

07:27.457 --> 07:28.624
Here.
- Thank you.

07:28.624 --> 07:29.874
- That's for you.

07:30.740 --> 07:32.740
This is also for you.

07:33.816 --> 07:36.030
All right, I'll take these.

07:36.030 --> 07:37.030
- Thank you.

07:38.971 --> 07:42.161
- [Tyler] Oh yeah, look at this.

07:42.161 --> 07:44.728
(people muttering)

07:44.728 --> 07:47.789
Perfect.
- Yeah, it's great.

07:47.789 --> 07:49.056
- [Tyler] Very humble.
174
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:49,929
Uh oh.

07:49.929 --> 07:52.679
(wind whooshing)

07:59.751 --> 08:02.501
(door squeaking)

08:03.493 --> 08:04.326
- [Tyler] I think the Pentagon

08:04.326 --> 08:06.230
uses a similar security system

08:06.230 --> 08:07.648
where you just slightly
push the door open.

08:07.648 --> 08:08.815
- Oh, stop it.

08:11.703 --> 08:12.536
Aha.
- Ooh.

08:13.391 --> 08:14.363
- Look at this place, hun.
- I thought you said

08:14.363 --> 08:16.279
that I go in first.
- Mm-hmm.

08:16.279 --> 08:17.524
- Nice.
- Very nice.

08:17.524 --> 08:18.635
- Very nice.

08:18.635 --> 08:19.623
- Very cool.

08:19.623 --> 08:20.623
- Oh, hello.

08:23.348 --> 08:27.848
- (grunts) Welcome to Casa Bandaresa.

08:29.898 --> 08:31.219
I'm Doug, property owner.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.811
- Winston, nice to meet you.

08:32.811 --> 08:35.144
- Nice to meet you, Winston.

08:36.544 --> 08:38.289
Well why don't I give you quick tour, huh?

08:38.289 --> 08:39.121
- Okay.

08:41.715 --> 08:43.464
(soft intriguing music)

08:43.464 --> 08:48.381
- You got your two spare bedrooms
here and across the hall.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.386
You got the master for you and the Mrs.

08:52.386 --> 08:53.627
- Oh, this is great.

08:53.627 --> 08:54.713
- Private bathroom.

08:54.713 --> 08:56.235
- Okay.

08:56.235 --> 09:00.075
- Yup, you got the whole side
of the house for yourself,

09:00.075 --> 09:03.086
so nobody'll be able
to hear ya. (chuckles)

09:03.086 --> 09:06.165
(Winston chuckling softly)

09:06.165 --> 09:07.635
You got your washer/dryer.

09:07.635 --> 09:08.552
- Oh, nice.

09:09.663 --> 09:10.496
- Yeah.

09:10.496 --> 09:12.079
- Is this a closet?

09:13.524 --> 09:15.717
- This is private.

09:15.717 --> 09:18.050
This is my private property.

09:19.191 --> 09:21.279
I'll ask you to respect that.

09:21.279 --> 09:23.612
- [Winston] Sure, I'm sorry.

09:25.076 --> 09:27.726
- I wanna show you something.

09:27.726 --> 09:29.544
I think you'll enjoy it.

09:29.544 --> 09:30.961
- [Winston] Okay.

09:36.513 --> 09:38.059
What is this?

09:38.059 --> 09:42.777
- These are some of the
rarest instruments of combat

09:42.777 --> 09:45.360
in the history of civilization.

09:48.676 --> 09:51.259
This is my piece de resistance.

09:53.864 --> 09:54.697
This

09:55.926 --> 09:58.569
is a special limited edition

09:58.569 --> 10:00.902
Deutsche Waffen und Fabriken

10:02.427 --> 10:04.594
manufactured Luger pistol.

10:10.388 --> 10:12.305
Number eins neun sechs.

10:14.528 --> 10:17.389
Do you realize what that means?

10:17.389 --> 10:18.294
- I do not, no.

10:18.294 --> 10:20.732
- It was issued to an officer.

10:20.732 --> 10:23.216
That piece of machinery in your hand

10:23.216 --> 10:26.883
belonged to a high-ranking
member of the SS.

10:27.977 --> 10:30.568
It's impossible to say which.

10:30.568 --> 10:32.289
- [Winston] Why do you have this?

10:32.289 --> 10:36.039
- It was passed down to
me by my grandfather.

10:39.397 --> 10:40.263
- [Winston] So your grandfather

10:40.263 --> 10:42.763
took that from a Nazi officer?

10:47.179 --> 10:48.722
- No.

10:48.722 --> 10:52.055
(dark foreboding music)

11:01.065 --> 11:04.565
I always lock this up before I leave town.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.691
Better safe than sorry.

11:13.691 --> 11:15.243
- (chuckles) Right.

11:15.243 --> 11:16.326
- Right here.

11:18.123 --> 11:21.748
Kept you pretty well-stocked
with water and perishables.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.938
The nearest store is about 20 miles.

11:23.938 --> 11:26.050
- Yeah, I noticed that.

11:26.050 --> 11:28.589
- Got your pool and hot tub out there.

11:28.589 --> 11:31.231
That's (sniffles) self-explanatory.

11:31.231 --> 11:32.682
- Self-explanatory, right.

11:32.682 --> 11:35.617
So hey, I noticed there's
some cell-dead spots up here.

11:35.617 --> 11:38.228
- Oh yeah, the cells generally drop

11:38.228 --> 11:40.603
once you pass Caya Tamazula.

11:40.603 --> 11:43.275
But there's some you know,

11:43.275 --> 11:46.827
random spots where you
can pick up service.

11:46.827 --> 11:47.660
- Oh cool.

11:47.660 --> 11:51.201
Do you know where those spots are?

11:51.201 --> 11:52.034
- No.

11:53.928 --> 11:55.325
- What if something happens,

11:55.325 --> 11:57.175
like an emergency or I don't know?

11:57.175 --> 11:58.221
- Emergency, yeah.

11:58.221 --> 12:00.970
Well you got the landline right there

12:00.970 --> 12:04.656
and for anything else, use the WiFi.

12:04.656 --> 12:07.739
That modem is the best money can buy.

12:08.681 --> 12:11.764
Most governments don't even allow it.

12:17.989 --> 12:21.108
(door squeaking)

12:21.108 --> 12:22.764
Well, I've got a flight to catch.

12:22.764 --> 12:25.347
But one last thing before I go.

12:26.823 --> 12:29.815
I know the Airgency has terms and agreement,

12:29.815 --> 12:31.866
but I like to do mine face-to-face,

12:31.866 --> 12:33.191
you know, friendly-like.

12:33.191 --> 12:35.392
- [Winston] Yeah, I see that.

12:35.392 --> 12:36.225
- So,

12:37.785 --> 12:39.479
you just sign it.

12:39.479 --> 12:40.967
- [Winston] Sign what?

12:40.967 --> 12:43.384
- [Doug] Terms and agreement.

12:45.183 --> 12:46.600
- [Winston] Okay.

12:47.782 --> 12:50.865
- We'll just take this out right now.

12:56.969 --> 12:58.525
Take care of my house, Warren.

12:58.525 --> 13:00.275
- Okay, it's Winston.

13:02.285 --> 13:05.035
(door squeaking)

13:11.535 --> 13:14.056
Is it just me or did anyone else think

13:14.056 --> 13:14.889
that guy's completely normal?

13:14.889 --> 13:15.855
(Julia chuckling)

13:15.855 --> 13:17.344
- Normal guy.
- Normal guy.

13:17.344 --> 13:18.421
- Normal guy.
- Lovely guy.

13:18.421 --> 13:19.504
- [Nate] Yup.

13:20.802 --> 13:23.748
âª There is just one thing âª

13:23.748 --> 13:26.665
âª Left here to say âª

13:28.344 --> 13:30.694
- [Nate] Ooh baby, hittin' that vape-vape.

13:30.694 --> 13:32.126
- Yeah.

13:32.126 --> 13:32.959
- Oh, man.

13:34.418 --> 13:35.669
How you doin'?

13:35.669 --> 13:37.625
- Doin' good, just tryin'
to deejay this thing.

13:37.625 --> 13:38.458
- Yeah.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.055
Well that's kinda why I
came over here actually.

13:41.055 --> 13:43.241
You think I could change
the music by chance

13:43.241 --> 13:44.074
to somethin' like--

13:44.074 --> 13:45.397
- [Tyler] Not really feelin' it?

13:45.397 --> 13:46.939
- I don't know, maybe
somethin' more upbeat

13:46.939 --> 13:48.017
or party-like, you know?

13:48.017 --> 13:48.850
- Sure, yeah.

13:48.850 --> 13:49.683
What're you thinkin'?

13:49.683 --> 13:50.516
- Literally anything else.

13:50.516 --> 13:51.349
- [Tyler] Yeah.

13:51.349 --> 13:52.390
- Get off of your phone.

13:52.390 --> 13:53.633
- What if he's tryin' to reach me,

13:53.633 --> 13:55.540
but he can't because I don't have service?

13:55.540 --> 13:56.705
- I'm gonna throw it in the pool.

13:56.705 --> 13:57.538
This is what I'm gonna do.

13:57.538 --> 13:59.082
I'm gonna throw it in the pool.

13:59.082 --> 14:00.916
Who cares if he's tryin' to reach you?

14:00.916 --> 14:02.885
He's the one that asked for a break.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.065
You deserve to have fun.

14:05.065 --> 14:06.565
Right?
- One night.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.187
- Taste this, this is very good.

14:12.770 --> 14:16.702
- It's about animals, but
it's commenting on society.

14:16.702 --> 14:19.777
It's actually an allegory for gun control.

14:19.777 --> 14:20.610
- See, we're done.

14:20.610 --> 14:21.443
You have fun.
- Yup, one night.

14:21.443 --> 14:22.276
- We're gonna put this here

14:22.276 --> 14:24.098
and we're not gonna think about him.

14:24.098 --> 14:25.798
We're not gonna talk about him

14:25.798 --> 14:27.202
and we're gonna have fun
'cause we deserve it.

14:27.202 --> 14:29.826
- [Tyler] I'm really excited
to put it out actually.

14:29.826 --> 14:31.651
- Hey, sorry to cut you off.

14:31.651 --> 14:32.665
I'll be right back.

14:32.665 --> 14:33.498
- Sure, yeah.

14:33.498 --> 14:34.790
- [Nate] Thank you for
changing the music though.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.290
- Okay, yeah.

14:36.290 --> 14:38.197
You're right.

14:38.197 --> 14:39.085
- Right about what?

14:39.085 --> 14:40.263
(Abby chuckling softly)

14:40.263 --> 14:42.746
I couldn't help but overhear.

14:42.746 --> 14:44.799
I don't know, I been going
through some rough times

14:44.799 --> 14:48.434
and I have gone through some rough times.

14:48.434 --> 14:49.613
- Be back, sorry.

14:49.613 --> 14:50.613
- Excuse us.

14:52.364 --> 14:53.197
She's great.

14:53.197 --> 14:54.030
- [Winston] Havin' fun?

14:54.030 --> 14:56.440
- [Tyler] Yeah, just deejayin' this thing.

14:56.440 --> 15:00.336
I'm like Funkmaster Flex in here, ya know?

15:00.336 --> 15:01.386
- Yeah.

15:01.386 --> 15:05.217
I don't wanna get too sentimental,
but I'm glad you came.

15:05.217 --> 15:06.478
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

15:06.478 --> 15:08.619
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

15:08.619 --> 15:09.739
'Cause we used to do this all the time.

15:09.739 --> 15:11.713
- Yeah, boys gettin' back out there.

15:11.713 --> 15:12.660
- [Winston] Boys gettin' back out there.

15:12.660 --> 15:13.717
- With some girls in the mix.

15:13.717 --> 15:14.550
- [Winston] Yes.

15:14.550 --> 15:16.853
- With some douches in the mix.

15:16.853 --> 15:21.514
- One step forward, two or
three steps back, right?

15:21.514 --> 15:22.612
- Yeah.

15:22.612 --> 15:24.823
- Just by powers of deduction,

15:24.823 --> 15:27.663
I could probably guess guy trouble?

15:27.663 --> 15:29.571
- Is it that obvious?

15:29.571 --> 15:33.411
- No, I mean you keep fidgeting with that.

15:33.411 --> 15:35.674
- Except I'm tryin' to find faster music

15:35.674 --> 15:38.277
so that Nate can hit on
the woman I'm in love with

15:38.277 --> 15:39.505
at the speed he'd like to.

15:39.505 --> 15:40.338
- Stop it.

15:40.338 --> 15:41.868
Don't worry, he's harmless.

15:41.868 --> 15:43.526
- He's harming me.

15:43.526 --> 15:46.388
- It didn't work out and
that's okay, you know?

15:46.388 --> 15:49.501
We are the sum of our
experiences and I'm here with you

15:49.501 --> 15:52.878
because that didn't work
out and I like who I am.

15:52.878 --> 15:54.126
- Have you heard from Margot?

15:54.126 --> 15:55.610
- [Tyler] No, why?

15:55.610 --> 15:56.645
- She hasn't responded to anything

15:56.645 --> 15:58.267
and she was supposed to be here.

15:58.267 --> 16:01.260
She doesn't seem just
different to you lately?

16:01.260 --> 16:02.392
(Tyler sighing)

16:02.392 --> 16:03.529
Doesn't she?

16:03.529 --> 16:04.362
- I don't know.

16:04.362 --> 16:05.424
No.

16:05.424 --> 16:07.129
No.
- Maybe it's me.

16:07.129 --> 16:08.350
- [Tyler] You're overthinking it.

16:08.350 --> 16:09.183
- That could be.

16:09.183 --> 16:10.016
- Oh man, I'm so sorry.

16:10.016 --> 16:11.237
You look really sad right now.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.542
- No, it's fine.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.003
No, it's gonna be great.

16:14.003 --> 16:15.293
- Knock, knock.

16:15.293 --> 16:16.126
- Who's there?

16:16.126 --> 16:16.959
- Interrupting cow.

16:16.959 --> 16:19.042
- Interrupting cow.
- Moo.

16:20.036 --> 16:20.869
Yeah, see?

16:20.869 --> 16:22.974
- Thank you. (chuckles)
- There you go.

16:22.974 --> 16:24.917
That smile looks pretty good on you.

16:24.917 --> 16:25.750
- Thanks.

16:27.624 --> 16:28.457
- You know.

16:28.457 --> 16:29.904
- [Abby] Oh hey, Winston.

16:29.904 --> 16:30.874
- Hey, Abby.

16:30.874 --> 16:32.944
- I know me coming was kind of last minute

16:32.944 --> 16:35.701
and I just really appreciate
you letting me tag along.

16:35.701 --> 16:36.996
- Yeah, no, I'm glad you came.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.185
- Yeah, you did some
BuzzFeed stuff, right?

16:39.185 --> 16:42.462
- Yeah, I mean they asked me
to do a couple things for 'em.

16:42.462 --> 16:43.822
- I love BuzzFeed.

16:43.822 --> 16:44.789
List, list, list.

16:44.789 --> 16:45.622
Very clickable.

16:45.622 --> 16:47.218
- Well I want you to have a nice birthday.

16:47.218 --> 16:48.051
- [Winston] Thank you.

16:48.051 --> 16:48.884
- You're welcome.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.137
- I hope you're havin' a good time.

16:50.137 --> 16:51.442
- Hope you're havin' a good time.

16:51.442 --> 16:52.557
- I'm havin' a great time.
- Are ya?

16:52.557 --> 16:54.176
- Nate just got outta prison, right?

16:54.176 --> 16:56.267
- It was court-ordered rehab, but sure.

16:56.267 --> 16:57.973
He's actually been so open about it

16:57.973 --> 16:58.837
and he has such a good heart.

16:58.837 --> 17:01.090
It's really been a good experience.

17:01.090 --> 17:02.152
- That's great.
- Yeah.

17:02.152 --> 17:03.728
- I've heard from several people

17:03.728 --> 17:07.892
that coming back from prison's
a typically great experience.

17:07.892 --> 17:08.724
I'm gonna grab something from the kitchen.

17:08.724 --> 17:10.012
- Well it wasn't like that, but okay.

17:10.012 --> 17:10.954
- Do you want anything?
- No thanks.

17:10.954 --> 17:11.787
- Want more wine?
- No thanks.

17:11.787 --> 17:13.035
- No?

17:13.035 --> 17:13.867
What's poppin'?

17:13.867 --> 17:14.914
- What's up, dude?
- Tyler, hey.

17:14.914 --> 17:15.747
- What's goin' on?

17:15.747 --> 17:16.579
Hey.

17:16.579 --> 17:17.413
- I feel like I haven't had a chance

17:17.413 --> 17:18.666
to talk to you all night.

17:18.666 --> 17:20.646
- Yeah, it's kind of been...

17:20.646 --> 17:21.872
I was very busy.

17:21.872 --> 17:24.040
I just feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

17:24.040 --> 17:24.938
Everything's good?

17:24.938 --> 17:26.105
Mitch is good?

17:27.378 --> 17:29.043
- Yeah.
- Good.

17:29.043 --> 17:30.077
- Yeah, everything's good.

17:30.077 --> 17:30.910
How 'bout you?

17:30.910 --> 17:31.868
What've you been up to?

17:31.868 --> 17:34.153
- Super great, actually.

17:34.153 --> 17:37.713
Kind of cool news: I am
getting published this summer.

17:37.713 --> 17:38.973
I just hooked up with a little publisher,

17:38.973 --> 17:40.832
so been doin' some short stories.

17:40.832 --> 17:41.665
- That's amazing.

17:41.665 --> 17:43.631
I'm so happy for you.
- It's no big deal.

17:43.631 --> 17:45.060
But it is a big deal, yeah.

17:45.060 --> 17:46.392
- Are you drinking again?

17:46.392 --> 17:48.606
- Yeah mom, like a couple.

17:48.606 --> 17:49.504
- [Julia] I hate when you call me mom.

17:49.504 --> 17:51.477
- Okay, well don't be mom.

17:51.477 --> 17:52.564
- Well just be careful.

17:52.564 --> 17:53.431
I'm just looking out for you.

17:53.431 --> 17:54.663
- I know.
- But like, just be careful.

17:54.663 --> 17:55.496
- I know, I know.

17:55.496 --> 17:56.426
- Okay, I trust you.
- Thank you.

17:56.426 --> 17:58.790
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:58.790 --> 18:00.077
- It's a new year, okay?

18:00.077 --> 18:00.910
For me.
- New you.

18:00.910 --> 18:01.890
- This is just a couple of these.

18:01.890 --> 18:04.460
- Maybe it'll be a wedding gift, right?

18:04.460 --> 18:06.100
It should be comin' out around that time.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.058
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

18:07.058 --> 18:11.286
That must be exciting and
stressful and crazy, yeah?

18:11.286 --> 18:12.368
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

18:12.368 --> 18:15.055
- [Julia] Are you interested?

18:15.055 --> 18:16.472
- In Abby?
- Yeah.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.642
- I mean, she's a little hottie.

18:18.642 --> 18:20.272
But she's engaged.
- Yeah.

18:20.272 --> 18:21.193
No, she's not.

18:21.193 --> 18:23.378
Just between you and I, okay?

18:23.378 --> 18:24.391
You can't tell anyone.

18:24.391 --> 18:26.387
They're split.

18:26.387 --> 18:29.515
- Are you seein' anyone?

18:29.515 --> 18:31.210
- No, no, no.

18:31.210 --> 18:32.078
- Well, good.

18:32.078 --> 18:32.911
Single.
- Yeah.

18:32.911 --> 18:33.749
- Single, livin' it up single.

18:33.749 --> 18:35.660
- Yup, livin' it up, livin' it down.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.808
- It's very recent, but they've
been over it for so long.

18:37.808 --> 18:38.659
He's bad.

18:38.659 --> 18:39.492
He's bad for her.

18:39.492 --> 18:40.325
She's ready.

18:40.325 --> 18:41.455
They've been over it for a while.

18:41.455 --> 18:42.455
She's ready.

18:44.309 --> 18:45.485
We did say we're gonna go slow.

18:45.485 --> 18:46.368
- [Nate] Mom, mom.

18:46.368 --> 18:48.069
- Okay, I'm not tryin' to be mom.

18:48.069 --> 18:50.030
(soft intriguing music)

18:50.030 --> 18:51.665
- [Nate] There's the guy.

18:51.665 --> 18:52.582
Yes, this guy.

18:52.582 --> 18:53.415
- Yes.

18:53.415 --> 18:54.659
- We are here because of you.

18:54.659 --> 18:55.586
- All right.
- Having fun.

18:55.586 --> 18:56.419
- All right.

18:56.419 --> 18:57.252
- Cheers.

18:57.252 --> 18:58.775
What do you guys think, shots?

18:58.775 --> 19:00.013
- Sure, yeah.
- Yeah.

19:00.013 --> 19:00.846
Do a little shot?

19:00.846 --> 19:01.734
- I will do one.
- One tiny one?

19:01.734 --> 19:03.195
- I will do a light shot.
- A little one.

19:03.195 --> 19:05.799
- [Nate] Tyler, there's no
such thing as a light shot.

19:05.799 --> 19:07.256
- Pass this along to him.
- Thank you very much.

19:07.256 --> 19:08.672
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

19:08.672 --> 19:10.176
- [Nate] All right, put your glasses up.

19:10.176 --> 19:11.009
- Okay.

19:11.009 --> 19:12.585
- [Nate] This is to Winston.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.418
To Winston.

19:13.418 --> 19:15.164
- Winston.
- Happy birthday.

19:15.164 --> 19:17.181
- [Winston] Thank you.

19:17.181 --> 19:18.894
- [Nate] I love you, pal.

19:18.894 --> 19:20.593
- Whoa, I love you too.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.221
- [Nate] Thank you for getting older.

19:22.221 --> 19:23.208
- You're welcome.

19:23.208 --> 19:24.041
I'll keep doin' it.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.357
I have an idea.

19:25.357 --> 19:26.508
Hot tub?

19:26.508 --> 19:27.508
Hot tub, hun?
- Sure.

19:27.508 --> 19:28.600
- Do you wanna do it?
- Yeah.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.133
- Hot tub time?
- Yeah, you know yes.

19:30.133 --> 19:30.966
- Let's do it.

19:30.966 --> 19:31.981
- Hot tub adjacent.

19:31.981 --> 19:33.036
- Yeah, you can sit on the side.

19:33.036 --> 19:33.952
- I'll sit on the side.
- That's great.

19:33.952 --> 19:34.785
- [Nate] Tyler, get in the tub.

19:34.785 --> 19:35.618
What're you doin'?

19:35.618 --> 19:36.451
- He doesn't have to
if he doesn't want to.

19:36.451 --> 19:38.368
- [Julia] Yeah, get in.

19:58.872 --> 19:59.887
- Hot tub workin'?

19:59.887 --> 20:00.720
- I'm callin' Doug.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.303
This is ridiculous.

20:04.446 --> 20:07.113
(phone ringing)

20:07.964 --> 20:11.571
- [Doug] Can't figure
out the hot tub, can you?

20:11.571 --> 20:13.356
- Yeah hi, it's Winston.

20:13.356 --> 20:14.651
How'd you guess?

20:14.651 --> 20:17.805
- [Doug] I get the same
call every Friday at 10 p.m.

20:17.805 --> 20:19.985
You're actually ahead of schedule.

20:19.985 --> 20:20.818
- Right, I checked the--

20:20.818 --> 20:22.778
- [Doug] Control panel by the wall,

20:22.778 --> 20:25.842
then the remote, then you
gave up and called me.

20:25.842 --> 20:27.056
No worries, my friend.

20:27.056 --> 20:29.427
I'll send over Joe and
he'll take care of it.

20:29.427 --> 20:30.584
- Wait, who's Joe?

20:30.584 --> 20:31.881
Aren't you in Mexico?

20:31.881 --> 20:35.934
(soft foreboding music)

20:35.934 --> 20:37.230
Fucking creep.

20:37.230 --> 20:38.063
- What was that?

20:38.063 --> 20:39.445
- [Winston] I don't know.

20:39.445 --> 20:40.278
- [Tyler] What do you
mean, you don't know?

20:40.278 --> 20:42.901
- I don't know what that was.

20:42.901 --> 20:44.887
- Lotta people are just reclaiming wood

20:44.887 --> 20:46.666
and then charging double for it

20:46.666 --> 20:48.601
'cause it used to be in a barn,

20:48.601 --> 20:50.434
which is why you get stuff like this.

20:50.434 --> 20:51.267
- Right.

20:52.220 --> 20:53.303
(door knocking)

20:53.303 --> 20:54.577
There he is.

20:54.577 --> 20:55.577
There he is.

20:57.929 --> 20:59.534
Hey.
- Hey, party police.

20:59.534 --> 21:01.446
- Joe?
- Yeah that's me, Joe.

21:01.446 --> 21:03.406
I'm not really a police officer.

21:03.406 --> 21:05.785
Whoa, hello model club.
- That's the gang.

21:05.785 --> 21:08.794
- This is a handsome crew
and a beautiful crew.

21:08.794 --> 21:10.726
What are we celebratin' here?

21:10.726 --> 21:11.662
- It's my birthday.

21:11.662 --> 21:12.883
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

21:12.883 --> 21:13.757
- What is it, sweet 16?

21:13.757 --> 21:14.628
Quinceanera?

21:14.628 --> 21:15.461
- Wow.

21:15.461 --> 21:16.359
Yeah, right.

21:16.359 --> 21:17.192
It's just out here.

21:17.192 --> 21:18.025
- Yeah, sure.

21:18.025 --> 21:18.858
- So I'm pushin' buttons.

21:18.858 --> 21:20.258
I don't know what I'm doin' out there.

21:20.258 --> 21:21.091
- Oh okay, yeah.

21:21.091 --> 21:22.480
No, it's no big deal.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.750
Honestly, like really anyone can do it.

21:24.750 --> 21:25.583
- Okay.

21:29.498 --> 21:30.931
- The adults are a little too old.

21:30.931 --> 21:32.560
It'd be freaky if there were no kids.

21:32.560 --> 21:33.393
- Wow.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.602
- Anyway, this thing gives people fits.

21:34.602 --> 21:36.497
Don't beat yourself up too much.

21:36.497 --> 21:39.605
It's just really basically that.

21:39.605 --> 21:40.621
- [Winston] It's just one button?

21:40.621 --> 21:42.531
- Yup, just the one.

21:42.531 --> 21:43.408
Tub time.

21:43.408 --> 21:46.104
- Oh, I thought Doug could've
told me that over the phone.

21:46.104 --> 21:47.614
- Happy birthday.

21:47.614 --> 21:49.168
- Okay, all right.

21:49.168 --> 21:51.377
(water gurgling)

21:51.377 --> 21:53.033
- Basically hit just a couple buttons.

21:53.033 --> 21:54.508
It's so easy a caveman can do it.

21:54.508 --> 21:55.341
You remember those?

21:55.341 --> 21:56.972
How did they find cavemen
in this day and age?

21:56.972 --> 21:58.208
- I don't know.
- That always kills me.

21:58.208 --> 21:59.041
- Very easy.

21:59.041 --> 22:00.352
All right, thank you
so much for coming by.

22:00.352 --> 22:01.185
- Yeah.

22:01.185 --> 22:02.018
No, my pleasure.

22:02.018 --> 22:02.851
Seems like a great group.

22:02.851 --> 22:04.793
You guys look like you're gonna
have a great time tonight.

22:04.793 --> 22:06.685
And you know, that's good
that some people out there

22:06.685 --> 22:08.358
are gonna have fun because you know,

22:08.358 --> 22:10.192
we shouldn't all feel lonely, right?

22:10.192 --> 22:13.723
It's good to have people
havin' a good time.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.881
You know, I got some
action figures I've been

22:15.881 --> 22:16.964
playin' a Survivor game with.

22:16.964 --> 22:18.293
I got little tiki torches for 'em

22:18.293 --> 22:20.537
and I think Captain America's
on his way out tonight,

22:20.537 --> 22:22.130
so I gotta get back to that.

22:22.130 --> 22:23.137
- All right, all right.

22:23.137 --> 22:24.202
Well, stay safe.

22:24.202 --> 22:27.785
- No, you should stay
and hang out with us.

22:30.010 --> 22:31.187
- Can't interrupt this.

22:31.187 --> 22:32.020
The birthday boy.

22:32.020 --> 22:33.992
Joe doesn't wanna overshadow anybody.

22:33.992 --> 22:34.884
- No.

22:34.884 --> 22:36.384
- Can't have too many
hunks in the house, right?

22:36.384 --> 22:38.313
- Yeah, you came all the way
out here to fix our hot tub.

22:38.313 --> 22:39.894
Of course.

22:39.894 --> 22:40.804
- No, it's my pleasure.

22:40.804 --> 22:42.065
It's actually my obligation.

22:42.065 --> 22:42.898
It's my job.

22:42.898 --> 22:45.641
So if I didn't, I'd be in big trouble.

22:45.641 --> 22:47.814
(chuckles softly) Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:47.814 --> 22:50.734
Are you sure that this is
gonna be cool with Doug?

22:50.734 --> 22:52.525
'Cause he said, he was like,
"No drinking, no partying."

22:52.525 --> 22:53.733
- Oh yeah, no, no.

22:53.733 --> 22:54.830
No, Doug is super laid back.

22:54.830 --> 22:57.109
He just wants you guys to
come out here and have fun.

22:57.109 --> 22:58.524
- Great, that's great.
- Yeah.

22:58.524 --> 23:00.007
- He seems like a very laid back fella.

23:00.007 --> 23:01.317
- Yeah.
- Okay good, good.

23:01.317 --> 23:02.992
Good, good, good.

23:02.992 --> 23:03.950
- Yeah, let's just kick it.

23:03.950 --> 23:04.783
Let's kick it, let's kick it.

23:04.783 --> 23:05.715
Is that cool?

23:05.715 --> 23:07.043
- Ladies and gentlemen.

23:07.043 --> 23:09.664
- [Winston] Oh boy, whatcha got there?

23:09.664 --> 23:10.874
- My little treat.

23:10.874 --> 23:11.707
- [Winston] Whatcha got there, Nate Dog?

23:11.707 --> 23:12.630
- A little treat for my baby boy.

23:12.630 --> 23:13.588
- Whatcha got?
- Yeah.

23:13.588 --> 23:14.726
- Wow.
- You know.

23:14.726 --> 23:15.995
- [Tyler] A real health guru.

23:15.995 --> 23:16.828
- Yeah, you know.

23:16.828 --> 23:17.661
It's not bad.

23:17.661 --> 23:19.309
Just a little MDMA.

23:19.309 --> 23:21.924
Some Molly for the laymen.

23:21.924 --> 23:22.757
- [Winston] Okay.

23:22.757 --> 23:24.550
- Okay.
- It's fine.

23:24.550 --> 23:27.904
- [Tyler] And no one's
ever died on this stuff?

23:27.904 --> 23:28.737
- I don't know, man.

23:28.737 --> 23:31.820
I don't work for the cops.
- For sure.

23:32.698 --> 23:35.185
- Lemme get a good bit of that.

23:35.185 --> 23:36.348
- They're not even that hard.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.874
It's like 100 milligrams a pill, you know?

23:38.874 --> 23:39.707
- [Winston] That seems like it's a lot.

23:39.707 --> 23:41.416
- Opens your mind a little bit.

23:41.416 --> 23:42.792
That's it.
- Great.

23:42.792 --> 23:45.042
So if I can just put this
is in proper context:

23:45.042 --> 23:47.231
You were in prison and
now you're not in prison

23:47.231 --> 23:48.690
and now you're on parole.

23:48.690 --> 23:51.549
And while you're on parole,
you have a bottle of MDMA.

23:51.549 --> 23:52.382
- What?

23:52.382 --> 23:53.761
What's he talkin' about?

23:53.761 --> 23:55.042
- I wasn't in prison.

23:55.042 --> 23:58.696
There's a difference between
jail and prison, all right?

23:58.696 --> 24:01.288
So that's harmful to tell
people that I was in prison.

24:01.288 --> 24:02.121
- [Tyler] For sure, sure.

24:02.121 --> 24:02.954
- First of all.

24:02.954 --> 24:04.192
Yeah I don't know, man.

24:04.192 --> 24:05.609
My past is rocky.

24:06.911 --> 24:09.371
My life hasn't been great
and I made mistakes.

24:09.371 --> 24:12.610
But you know, I'm tryin'
to do right by my own self

24:12.610 --> 24:14.264
and everybody else around me.

24:14.264 --> 24:16.192
And I feel like right now,
I'm havin' a good time.

24:16.192 --> 24:18.023
I'm not denying that I fucked up.

24:18.023 --> 24:18.856
I fucked up.

24:18.856 --> 24:20.609
My past sucks, you know?

24:20.609 --> 24:23.712
But like I think everybody's
done shit that they all--

24:23.712 --> 24:25.369
- I think that is so brave, man.

24:25.369 --> 24:27.723
Can I give you a hug?

24:27.723 --> 24:28.556
C'mon.

24:28.556 --> 24:30.175
Lemme just flop on you, Sammy.

24:30.175 --> 24:32.204
You know, you're in quite a happy place.

24:32.204 --> 24:33.539
When a man trusts himself,

24:33.539 --> 24:36.706
he is finally free to trust the world.

24:37.905 --> 24:39.502
- I like that.
- You're a brave guy.

24:39.502 --> 24:41.171
- Thank you for sharing that with us.

24:41.171 --> 24:44.465
- Yeah, it's you know, tough
to be vulnerable sometimes.

24:44.465 --> 24:45.298
- Yeah.

24:45.298 --> 24:46.548
No, I get that.

24:47.733 --> 24:49.233
- You want?
- Sure.

24:52.201 --> 24:53.638
- [Nate] Joe-blow.

24:53.638 --> 24:54.531
- [Joe] Here goes nothin'.

24:54.531 --> 24:55.504
- [Nate] Here, man.

24:55.504 --> 24:58.138
- I'm a Flintstone kid.

24:58.138 --> 24:58.971
- No.

25:00.341 --> 25:03.125
I mean, maybe just one of the other.

25:03.125 --> 25:04.171
- What?

25:04.171 --> 25:06.247
- You know, you been
drinking a lot tonight.

25:06.247 --> 25:07.643
Just maybe wait 'til tomorrow

25:07.643 --> 25:08.681
when you haven't been drinking.

25:08.681 --> 25:10.012
- That's a great idea.

25:10.012 --> 25:11.033
Because it would be terrible

25:11.033 --> 25:13.500
if Winston actually had
any fun on his birthday.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.157
That would actually be tragic
to the whole happy birthday.

25:16.157 --> 25:17.117
- I'm gonna go.

25:17.117 --> 25:18.174
- No.

25:18.174 --> 25:19.268
- Yeah.
- No.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.447
- Come back, come back.
- No.

25:21.447 --> 25:23.096
- [Nate] They're not even that potent.

25:23.096 --> 25:23.929
I'm tellin' ya.

25:23.929 --> 25:25.080
- [Julia] Sorry I said anything.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.163
- Okay, well.

25:29.188 --> 25:30.480
- C'mon, man.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.171
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

25:32.171 --> 25:33.768
- Ooh, man.
- I was just bein' a goof.

25:33.768 --> 25:35.307
I was bein' a goofer.

25:35.307 --> 25:36.691
- Oh man, c'mon.

25:36.691 --> 25:37.524
Really?

25:39.813 --> 25:40.924
Hey, hun?

25:40.924 --> 25:41.757
Julia.

25:41.757 --> 25:42.957
- What?

25:42.957 --> 25:43.790
- C'mon.

25:44.681 --> 25:45.902
- He's being an asshole.

25:45.902 --> 25:46.995
- I know, I'm gonna talk to him.

25:46.995 --> 25:48.256
It's just his sense of humor.

25:48.256 --> 25:49.526
- No, it's not a sense of humor.

25:49.526 --> 25:50.894
It's directly to my brother.

25:50.894 --> 25:51.780
It's been all night.

25:51.780 --> 25:53.762
- Okay, I'm gonna talk to him.

25:53.762 --> 25:55.586
We're all just havin' fun.

25:55.586 --> 25:57.203
- Yeah yeah, you're all having fun.

25:57.203 --> 25:59.233
You're like slamming drinks.

25:59.233 --> 26:00.066
- What?

26:00.066 --> 26:01.116
- You said you were gonna go lighter

26:01.116 --> 26:02.405
and now you're like slamming drinks.

26:02.405 --> 26:03.565
- Oh, come on.

26:03.565 --> 26:05.529
Everyone.
(window tapping)

26:05.529 --> 26:07.612
Someone at the back door?

26:08.481 --> 26:09.859
- I can't go like this.

26:09.859 --> 26:10.828
- All right.
- You have to go.

26:10.828 --> 26:12.995
- Well, I'll check it out.

26:15.622 --> 26:16.459
(window tapping)

26:16.459 --> 26:17.292
- [Man] Oh, there he is.

26:17.292 --> 26:18.309
There's our boy.

26:18.309 --> 26:19.480
Yeah I'm right here, sir.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.236
Please open up the
sliding glass door, sir.

26:21.236 --> 26:22.964
- Hi, how're you doin'?
- Hey, how's it goin'?

26:22.964 --> 26:24.969
- Hey there, officer.
- What's goin' on?

26:24.969 --> 26:26.305
- No, not officer.

26:26.305 --> 26:27.472
- No, not yet.

26:28.954 --> 26:30.099
- Community Task Force.

26:30.099 --> 26:30.974
Voice of these people, sir.

26:30.974 --> 26:32.197
- Oh wow.

26:32.197 --> 26:33.243
- [Man] We got a call from the station.

26:33.243 --> 26:34.490
Heard you guys were havin' a party.

26:34.490 --> 26:36.100
Got a noise complaint from your neighbors.

26:36.100 --> 26:36.933
Just wanted to come by

26:36.933 --> 26:38.391
and make sure everything was okay,

26:38.391 --> 26:39.460
make sure you guys were safe.

26:39.460 --> 26:40.863
- A noise complaint?

26:40.863 --> 26:42.176
- Yeah.
- From who?

26:42.176 --> 26:43.856
I haven't seen another house for miles.

26:43.856 --> 26:45.263
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:45.263 --> 26:46.150
Now take it easy, okay?

26:46.150 --> 26:47.421
You're makin' him nervous.
- All right.

26:47.421 --> 26:48.927
- I'm not nervous.

26:48.927 --> 26:49.937
- [Man] I think he's a little nervous.

26:49.937 --> 26:50.770
- No, I'm just confused

26:50.770 --> 26:52.477
'cause we haven't seen any other houses.

26:52.477 --> 26:54.101
- We're all on the same side here, okay?

26:54.101 --> 26:57.248
We just wanted to come by and
make sure you guys were okay.

26:57.248 --> 26:58.882
Looks like you guys are
partying, havin' a good time.

26:58.882 --> 27:00.818
Wanted to make sure you
guys were safe, okay?

27:00.818 --> 27:02.477
- Okay, yeah.
- Are you okay?

27:02.477 --> 27:03.633
- Yeah, definitely.
- Okay.

27:03.633 --> 27:08.437
- Is it normal for you guys
to come to the backdoor?

27:08.437 --> 27:09.354
- This guy.

27:10.965 --> 27:11.798
All right, random guess.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.295
Are you from LA?

27:13.295 --> 27:14.128
- Yeah, he is.

27:14.128 --> 27:15.456
Look at him.
- You're from Los Angeles.

27:15.456 --> 27:17.219
- Look at his haircut, man.
- The city of angels.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.288
You got angels all over you.

27:19.288 --> 27:21.309
(laughs) Look at this guy.

27:21.309 --> 27:22.392
- [Man] Oh, man.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.548
(cellphone buzzing)

27:24.548 --> 27:26.931
We know you like come
out here to party it up.

27:26.931 --> 27:29.042
Gotta have fun, drink a little beer, yeah?

27:29.042 --> 27:30.496
Smoke a little hashish, yeah?

27:30.496 --> 27:32.393
You know what I'm talkin'
about, a little reefer?

27:32.393 --> 27:33.226
- [Winston] Oh, I don't know.

27:33.226 --> 27:35.751
- You have a little chronic.
- He knows, he knows.

27:35.751 --> 27:36.603
- Oh, man.

27:36.603 --> 27:38.105
Hey, just keep it down, okay?

27:38.105 --> 27:40.419
'Cause everyone around here,
they're like 90 years old.

27:40.419 --> 27:42.137
Like they'll wake up like that, okay?

27:42.137 --> 27:44.149
They don't like to be woken up
and they call us, all right?

27:44.149 --> 27:44.982
- Yeah.
- All right.

27:44.982 --> 27:46.289
We're gonna take off, all right?

27:46.289 --> 27:48.339
We don't wanna put another
damper on your night.

27:48.339 --> 27:49.172
- Okay, sure.

27:49.172 --> 27:50.005
Thank you.
- Have a good one, sir.

27:50.005 --> 27:51.029
- All right, you too.
- Have a good night.

27:51.029 --> 27:51.862
- Goodnight.

27:51.862 --> 27:52.695
- Ooh, wait.

27:52.695 --> 27:54.645
One more thing.

27:54.645 --> 27:56.880
If anything happens, anything goes wrong,

27:56.880 --> 27:58.954
don't call the sheriff's department, okay?

27:58.954 --> 28:00.544
They are ruthless.

28:00.544 --> 28:01.377
- Ruthless?

28:01.377 --> 28:02.862
- Yeah.
- Yup, ruthless.

28:02.862 --> 28:04.161
- Zero tolerance.

28:04.161 --> 28:05.677
Doesn't matter what you could be doin'.

28:05.677 --> 28:07.310
You make a little noise,
shout a little bit,

28:07.310 --> 28:08.933
wake someone up, call him in there.

28:08.933 --> 28:10.110
He's gonna come in here so pissed off,

28:10.110 --> 28:11.977
he's gonna throw you in
jail (snaps) like that.

28:11.977 --> 28:12.810
- Yeah.
- No shit.

28:12.810 --> 28:14.309
- He's a dick.
- Real dick.

28:14.309 --> 28:15.142
- Okay.

28:15.142 --> 28:15.975
- [Man] Yeah and we know
him from high school.

28:15.975 --> 28:17.094
- Yeah.
- Wow.

28:17.094 --> 28:18.141
- Go Cougars.

28:18.141 --> 28:20.026
- Okay, good to know.

28:20.026 --> 28:20.859
All right.

28:20.859 --> 28:21.692
- [Man] Well anyways, man.

28:21.692 --> 28:22.650
- Okay.
- Have a good night, sir.

28:22.650 --> 28:23.483
- Thank you so much.

28:23.483 --> 28:24.316
- All right.
- Have a good night, sir.

28:24.316 --> 28:25.466
- See ya around.
- All right.

28:25.466 --> 28:26.299
Thanks, guys.

28:26.299 --> 28:28.020
- Ooh, tell Doug we said hi.

28:28.020 --> 28:29.120
- Oh, okay.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.116
- [Man] Love that Doug, man.

28:30.116 --> 28:31.616
- Okay, all right.

28:32.461 --> 28:35.378
(gravel crunching)

28:44.467 --> 28:46.396
Hey, everything okay?
- Hey.

28:46.396 --> 28:47.396
Yeah.
- Yeah?

28:49.296 --> 28:50.517
- Who was that?

28:50.517 --> 28:53.131
- That was neighborhood watch.

28:53.131 --> 28:54.464
Pretty nice guys.

28:54.464 --> 28:55.509
Yeah.

28:55.509 --> 28:56.843
You wanna go back out there?

28:56.843 --> 28:57.867
- Yes.
- Yeah?

28:57.867 --> 28:59.450
- I do.
- All right.

29:02.319 --> 29:04.528
- No, that's how I got real sick one time.

29:04.528 --> 29:05.996
I ate a lotta K crab.

29:05.996 --> 29:07.417
Not real, imitation.

29:07.417 --> 29:09.038
I just went hog-wild on it.

29:09.038 --> 29:11.076
- That's terrible.
- Crabby, crabby, crabby.

29:11.076 --> 29:14.278
- [Julia] So you guys wanna
take a picture for Instagram?

29:14.278 --> 29:16.112
- Oh my god.
- Yeah, do it.

29:16.112 --> 29:17.388
- Yes.
- One little pic.

29:17.388 --> 29:18.411
- Sorry about that earlier.

29:18.411 --> 29:19.853
I didn't mean it.
- That's okay.

29:19.853 --> 29:20.910
It's fine.

29:20.910 --> 29:23.458
Okay, everybody get close.

29:23.458 --> 29:24.291
- Of course.
- All right,

29:24.291 --> 29:27.614
I'm gonna sign up for Instagram
and then you better tag me.

29:27.614 --> 29:30.380
- [Julia] One, two, three.

29:30.380 --> 29:31.213
Aww.

29:31.213 --> 29:33.059
- You get it?
- Yeah.

29:33.059 --> 29:34.196
That's really nice.

29:34.196 --> 29:36.203
- [Joe] I wish my grandpa
was alive to see this.

29:36.203 --> 29:37.664
- Aw, man.
- He would freak.

29:37.664 --> 29:39.253
- Oh, jeez.
- He loved pictures.

29:39.253 --> 29:40.086
- Oh yeah?

29:40.086 --> 29:41.705
- Yeah, stared at 'em for hours.

29:41.705 --> 29:42.983
He has dementia and we lost him.

29:42.983 --> 29:44.107
- Oh.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

29:44.107 --> 29:44.985
- No, it's okay.

29:44.985 --> 29:46.647
We were close, we were very close.

29:46.647 --> 29:47.480
- [Tyler] Yeah.

29:47.480 --> 29:48.492
- [Winston] What do you do again for work?

29:48.492 --> 29:49.578
- Well you know, basically

29:49.578 --> 29:52.502
I'm a handyman here and help Doug out.

29:52.502 --> 29:53.335
I'm here, you know.

29:53.335 --> 29:55.301
I try and spread happiness if I can.

29:55.301 --> 29:57.760
I'm feeling great right now, by the way.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.387
I don't know what you gave me,

29:59.387 --> 30:02.554
but I'm havin' different expectations.

30:04.379 --> 30:05.806
- Is that Margot?

30:05.806 --> 30:08.806
(soft serene music)

30:11.961 --> 30:13.092
Hi, Margot.

30:13.092 --> 30:14.509
Glad you made it.

30:15.450 --> 30:18.150
- Tyler, do you wanna
come help me with my bags?

30:18.150 --> 30:19.567
- Yeah, I gotcha.

30:29.055 --> 30:30.705
This is it.

30:30.705 --> 30:32.038
This is the presidential suite.

30:32.038 --> 30:32.871
- Really?

30:33.724 --> 30:36.337
- Think Princess Diana
stayed in here once.

30:36.337 --> 30:38.261
- God.
- A little while ago.

30:38.261 --> 30:40.087
- Yo, it looks like a shit show out there.

30:40.087 --> 30:41.233
- [Tyler] It sucks.

30:41.233 --> 30:42.266
- Yeah.
- It sucks.

30:42.266 --> 30:44.246
- I saw a couple bars coming in from town.

30:44.246 --> 30:45.328
Do you wanna just go out?

30:45.328 --> 30:47.809
- No, no, no, no, no.

30:47.809 --> 30:52.554
It's Winston's birthday, so
I think I'll stay out there.

30:52.554 --> 30:54.515
You wanna come out with a beer?

30:54.515 --> 30:56.220
- Nah, I think I'm just gonna turn in.

30:56.220 --> 30:57.053
Are you okay?

30:57.053 --> 30:57.886
I don't wanna leave you hangin'.

30:57.886 --> 30:58.719
- Yeah no, I'm good.

30:58.719 --> 31:00.493
You sure you don't wanna come outside?

31:00.493 --> 31:02.026
Listen, Nate's got awesome stories.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.123
Julia has this fun thing

31:03.123 --> 31:06.278
where she invents a rule every 15 seconds.

31:06.278 --> 31:07.141
- [Margot] Okay, cool.

31:07.141 --> 31:08.828
- [Tyler] And I wanna drown
myself in the jacuzzi.

31:08.828 --> 31:09.661
- [Margot] Night.

31:09.661 --> 31:11.212
- There's a giant weird person.

31:11.212 --> 31:12.045
Okay.

31:13.070 --> 31:14.152
- [Nate] It's kind of
awesome that you know

31:14.152 --> 31:16.101
how to save somebody
in a drowning scenario.

31:16.101 --> 31:18.452
- [Tyler] Did anybody die yet?

31:18.452 --> 31:20.656
- Is Margot comin' out?

31:20.656 --> 31:24.208
- No, I think she's just
gonna turn in for the night.

31:24.208 --> 31:25.041
Go to bed.

31:25.041 --> 31:26.788
She seemed tired.

31:26.788 --> 31:27.960
- She's gonna turn in for the night?

31:27.960 --> 31:29.460
- [Tyler] Yeah, she said
to just say goodnight.

31:29.460 --> 31:30.429
- Okay, all right.

31:30.429 --> 31:31.262
- Where are you going?

31:31.262 --> 31:32.095
- I'm gonna go talk to her.

31:32.095 --> 31:32.928
- Don't go talk to her.

31:32.928 --> 31:33.761
- [Winston] Yes, take two seconds.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.276
- Winston, it's not worth it.

31:35.276 --> 31:36.607
- I'll be right back.
- It's your birthday.

31:36.607 --> 31:37.607
- It's fine.

31:39.698 --> 31:40.955
(door knocking)

31:40.955 --> 31:41.955
Hey, Margot?

31:44.572 --> 31:46.040
(door knocking)

31:46.040 --> 31:49.540
Margot, could you come out here for a sec?

31:50.518 --> 31:52.518
I'd love to talk to you.

31:53.806 --> 31:55.578
(door knocking)

31:55.578 --> 31:57.334
(Margot speaking faintly)

31:57.334 --> 32:00.642
I would love to know what I
did that was so fucking bad.

32:00.642 --> 32:02.630
(Margot speaking faintly)

32:02.630 --> 32:04.804
- This is bullshit.

32:04.804 --> 32:08.304
(Margot speaking faintly)

32:14.139 --> 32:16.298
- [Tyler] (sighs) I'm okay.

32:16.298 --> 32:18.687
- [Julia] It's nice you
can actually see the stars.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.737
- Yeah, it's great.
- Oh yeah.

32:20.737 --> 32:22.929
- Yeah, one time a plane was
careening towards the earth

32:22.929 --> 32:25.088
and I thought it was a shooting star.

32:25.088 --> 32:26.004
- Hey.
- And it turned out

32:26.004 --> 32:27.804
it was just a United flight.
- How'd it go?

32:27.804 --> 32:28.881
- It was awesome.
- Into a field.

32:28.881 --> 32:30.212
Everyone lived.
- Is this all whiskey?

32:30.212 --> 32:32.740
God.
- No, it's other stuff.

32:32.740 --> 32:35.479
- [Joe] The plane's speed a
pun 'cause it was an airplane.

32:35.479 --> 32:36.312
- [Tyler] Right, right.

32:36.312 --> 32:38.245
- You okay?
- Yeah, great.

32:38.245 --> 32:41.342
- (chuckles) He's funny.
- He's so funny. (chuckles)

32:41.342 --> 32:42.342
- I am beat.

32:43.414 --> 32:44.247
All right, guys.

32:44.247 --> 32:47.810
Well the cuckoo clock in my
brain says it's about time

32:47.810 --> 32:49.911
for Cinderella to turn
back into a pumpkin.

32:49.911 --> 32:51.676
I'm gonna head back to my house.

32:51.676 --> 32:52.509
- All right.
- Yeah.

32:52.509 --> 32:53.830
- All right, thank you for the help.

32:53.830 --> 32:54.663
- Take it easy.

32:54.663 --> 32:55.660
Ooh, I'm gettin' a little dizzy right now.

32:55.660 --> 32:56.493
- No, wait.

32:56.493 --> 32:58.136
You're not thinkin' of
driving home like that.

32:58.136 --> 32:58.969
- I didn't drive.

32:58.969 --> 32:59.802
I'm just gonna walk.

32:59.802 --> 33:01.379
I mean the roads are mostly
snake-free at this hour,

33:01.379 --> 33:03.463
so it should be good.

33:03.463 --> 33:04.394
Think they're seasonal animals.

33:04.394 --> 33:05.289
- No.
- All right.

33:05.289 --> 33:06.355
Well goodnight, bud.

33:06.355 --> 33:07.937
- Yeah, have a great night.
- Nice meeting you.

33:07.937 --> 33:10.359
- No, it's freezing outside.

33:10.359 --> 33:11.778
Even the drinking and the pills,

33:11.778 --> 33:13.525
I don't think that's safe.

33:13.525 --> 33:14.777
No, you should really just stay here

33:14.777 --> 33:16.048
and head home in the morning.

33:16.048 --> 33:17.623
- You mean it?
- Yeah.

33:17.623 --> 33:19.575
- Okay gimme a hug, you crazy cook.

33:19.575 --> 33:20.700
- Oh, okay.

33:20.700 --> 33:22.075
- A little squish for you.

33:22.075 --> 33:23.985
Bring it in, you are so soft.

33:23.985 --> 33:25.576
- [Abby] Oh, thanks.

33:25.576 --> 33:27.491
- You're like a blossom.

33:27.491 --> 33:30.054
I'm gonna call you Blossom.
- Okay. (chuckles)

33:30.054 --> 33:31.096
- All right, guys.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.266
Well just gonna head back in the house

33:33.266 --> 33:37.409
and wash my face so I
don't breakout. (chuckles)

33:37.409 --> 33:39.370
#30sProblems. (chuckles)

33:39.370 --> 33:40.240
- All right.
- All right.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.653
- Okay.
- Okay guys,

33:41.653 --> 33:42.568
have a great night.

33:42.568 --> 33:44.604
- Goodnight, Joe.
- Whoa, man overboard.

33:44.604 --> 33:46.447
(Abby and Joe chuckling)

33:46.447 --> 33:47.992
- Oh man.
- You guys are fun.

33:47.992 --> 33:49.846
- Sure.
- Yeah, we like to laugh.

33:49.846 --> 33:51.929
- [Nate] Old Bazooka Joe.

33:53.829 --> 33:56.154
- What are we possibly thinking?

33:56.154 --> 33:58.400
- This is a classic shitty idea.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.012
- Why, what?
- What?

34:00.012 --> 34:02.492
- Why would you invite
this guy to stay with us?

34:02.492 --> 34:03.924
- What do you mean, why not?

34:03.924 --> 34:04.865
- Why not?

34:04.865 --> 34:06.033
- He's off his rocker.

34:06.033 --> 34:06.901
- He's not bad.

34:06.901 --> 34:07.789
He's hilarious.

34:07.789 --> 34:09.574
He's just a big fuckin' dope.

34:09.574 --> 34:11.154
- You're stoned.

34:11.154 --> 34:12.371
He's insane.

34:12.371 --> 34:13.339
- He's like a little kid.

34:13.339 --> 34:14.842
He doesn't seem like he could hurt a fly.

34:14.842 --> 34:15.676
- [Nate] Right.

34:15.676 --> 34:16.646
Does he look like he could hurt a fly?

34:16.646 --> 34:17.855
- Okay, you guys.

34:17.855 --> 34:19.945
You're making it a much bigger
deal than it needs to be.

34:19.945 --> 34:20.976
It's gonna be one night.

34:20.976 --> 34:21.810
- [Abby] No, it is that.

34:21.810 --> 34:22.757
- You're fantastically comfortable

34:22.757 --> 34:25.206
sleeping with that man in our house?

34:25.206 --> 34:27.010
- I'm not comfortable, but it's one night.

34:27.010 --> 34:28.415
- It is a big deal.
- And he's not.

34:28.415 --> 34:29.344
- He might not hurt a fly.

34:29.344 --> 34:30.309
But I promise you,

34:30.309 --> 34:31.896
you'll wake up with
him fuckin' jerkin' off

34:31.896 --> 34:33.237
or he'll do somethin'.
- Oh my god.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.577
- [Tyler] He's a fuckin' weirdo.

34:34.577 --> 34:35.770
- You are just being a bully.

34:35.770 --> 34:36.650
Why are you bein' such a jerk?

34:36.650 --> 34:38.339
He didn't do anything to you.

34:38.339 --> 34:41.705
(singers vocalizing)
(water gurgling)

34:41.705 --> 34:42.538
- I'm sorry.

34:42.538 --> 34:43.371
No, you're right.

34:43.371 --> 34:45.427
Okay, I'm gonna go to bed.

34:45.427 --> 34:46.260
- No.

34:46.260 --> 34:47.092
- And I'm not lookin' out for the group,

34:47.092 --> 34:48.116
so I'm gonna go ahead.
- Tyler, wait.

34:48.116 --> 34:49.043
I didn't mean it.

34:49.043 --> 34:52.435
- [Tyler] Sorry I ruined
your night, you guys.

34:52.435 --> 34:53.440
- I didn't mean it.

34:53.440 --> 34:56.190
- It's okay, I'll go talk to him.

35:06.656 --> 35:07.613
Hey.

35:07.613 --> 35:08.446
- Hey.

35:09.463 --> 35:11.296
- That was rough, huh?

35:12.810 --> 35:14.643
- Honestly, it's cool.

35:16.886 --> 35:18.464
Why the fuck is she into him, man?

35:18.464 --> 35:19.350
I know you entertain him,

35:19.350 --> 35:21.347
but you know he's a fuckin' piece of shit

35:21.347 --> 35:23.749
and her fiance's garbage.

35:23.749 --> 35:24.644
I honestly don't understand

35:24.644 --> 35:27.407
what the fuck is so wrong with me.

35:27.407 --> 35:29.240
- [Winston] I'm sorry.

35:30.424 --> 35:33.276
- [Tyler] I wanna go home tomorrow.

35:33.276 --> 35:34.109
- [Winston] Okay.

35:34.109 --> 35:34.942
- I'm gonna have Margot take me.

35:34.942 --> 35:36.144
I'm sorry.

35:36.144 --> 35:36.977
- No, that's fine.

35:36.977 --> 35:37.810
I understand.

35:37.810 --> 35:38.643
No, that's good.

35:38.643 --> 35:42.532
- I'm not gonna have a good time like this

35:42.532 --> 35:43.995
and I wanna celebrate
your birthday with you,

35:43.995 --> 35:46.771
but it fuckin' sucks for me, dude.

35:46.771 --> 35:47.985
- It's okay.

35:47.985 --> 35:49.192
I get it.

35:49.192 --> 35:50.025
It's all right.
(Tyler sighing)

35:50.025 --> 35:51.347
Get some rest, all right?

35:51.347 --> 35:53.052
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

35:53.052 --> 35:55.053
- [Tyler] No no, it's fine.

35:55.053 --> 35:55.886
It's fine.

35:55.886 --> 35:57.469
- All right.
- Okay.

35:59.614 --> 36:00.973
- [Winston] Hey, what're you doin'?

36:00.973 --> 36:02.465
- Goin' to bed.
- No.

36:02.465 --> 36:03.313
- Yes.
- Why?

36:03.313 --> 36:04.979
- 'Cause I'm sleepy.

36:04.979 --> 36:06.105
It's late.

36:06.105 --> 36:08.523
- Well who's even still
out there, Nate and Abby?

36:08.523 --> 36:09.693
- Yeah.

36:09.693 --> 36:10.526
- All right.

36:10.526 --> 36:11.359
Well I think I'm gonna go.

36:11.359 --> 36:12.716
I'm gonna have one more.

36:12.716 --> 36:14.309
- [Julia] You're gonna have one more?

36:14.309 --> 36:15.631
Don't drink a lot.

36:15.631 --> 36:16.882
- What?

36:16.882 --> 36:18.715
- Just don't pound it.

36:19.694 --> 36:23.522
- No, I'm gonna bring one
out to sip on to be social.

36:23.522 --> 36:25.439
Here we go, here we go.

36:27.284 --> 36:28.530
What up?

36:28.530 --> 36:29.735
What up, what up?
- Oh, hey.

36:29.735 --> 36:30.568
- Hey.

36:30.568 --> 36:31.609
- Look what I got.
- How're you doin'?

36:31.609 --> 36:33.192
What do you got?
- Check it out.

36:33.192 --> 36:34.300
- Oh wow.
- Wow.

36:34.300 --> 36:36.435
- Huh?
- All right, all right.

36:36.435 --> 36:37.268
- We're gonna do it.

36:37.268 --> 36:38.351
- Somebody's enjoyin' the birthday.

36:38.351 --> 36:39.184
- [Winston] We're doin' it.

36:39.184 --> 36:40.023
- Are you havin' fun, bud?

36:40.023 --> 36:41.114
- Fuck yeah.
- Yeah, man.

36:41.114 --> 36:42.364
- It's awesome.

36:44.352 --> 36:45.646
Oh, that's nice.

36:45.646 --> 36:47.396
Oh baby, that's nice.

36:48.416 --> 36:50.147
Fuck, that is nice.

36:50.147 --> 36:51.480
All right, boom.

36:52.551 --> 36:56.062
(Abby chuckling softly)

36:56.062 --> 36:57.946
Good stuff.
- Yeah.

36:57.946 --> 36:59.614
- You guys wanna do yours?

36:59.614 --> 37:00.807
- What?
(Nate speaking faintly)

37:00.807 --> 37:02.731
Like what?
- It's stupid.

37:02.731 --> 37:03.564
- Why?
- Here we go.

37:03.564 --> 37:04.397
- [Nate] I just feel great, I don't know.

37:04.397 --> 37:05.230
- [Abby] It felt great.

37:05.230 --> 37:06.260
- This is great.
- I feel great.

37:06.260 --> 37:09.343
(Winston vocalizing)

37:10.559 --> 37:11.666
- [Nate] Coming out here was--

37:11.666 --> 37:12.950
- Should make that stuff taste better.

37:12.950 --> 37:14.667
- Weird, I guess 'cause it was cold.

37:14.667 --> 37:16.994
- [Winston] You guys want one?

37:16.994 --> 37:18.244
- I don't know.

37:20.495 --> 37:21.800
Bottoms up, man.
- Bottoms up.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.023
- Cheers, buddy.
(Abby chuckling)

37:24.023 --> 37:25.845
- Don't gotta tell me twice.

37:25.845 --> 37:27.518
- [Nate] I didn't know what to expect.

37:27.518 --> 37:28.651
- [Abby] Yeah.

37:28.651 --> 37:29.900
- Oh, this is nice.

37:29.900 --> 37:31.942
Right, it used to be?

37:31.942 --> 37:34.503
Get the gang back together.

37:34.503 --> 37:35.565
The gang back together.
- It's great, right?

37:35.565 --> 37:36.398
Isn't it great?
- Yeah.

37:36.398 --> 37:37.231
- Right, buddy?
- Really great.

37:37.231 --> 37:38.064
Yeah, man.

37:38.064 --> 37:38.897
- This is awesome.
- Back together.

37:38.897 --> 37:39.730
- Thank you guys for comin'.

37:39.730 --> 37:40.678
This is awesome.

37:40.678 --> 37:41.633
(Abby whispering and chuckling)

37:41.633 --> 37:42.466
This is insane.

37:42.466 --> 37:43.299
This is what I needed.

37:43.299 --> 37:45.071
This is exactly what I needed.

37:45.071 --> 37:45.904
Right?

37:45.904 --> 37:48.125
(Nate singing faintly)

37:48.125 --> 37:52.553
It's 'cause I think things
have been not what I thought.

37:52.553 --> 37:54.005
- Things are great.
- Not what I thought.

37:54.005 --> 37:54.838
- Yeah?
- It's so great.

37:54.838 --> 37:56.294
- (laughs) Not what I thought either.

37:56.294 --> 37:57.127
- I know.

37:57.127 --> 37:59.824
I know, I didn't think it'd
be like this, you know?

37:59.824 --> 38:03.005
But we're here now
together for the weekend.

38:03.005 --> 38:05.725
I really appreciate it.

38:05.725 --> 38:07.939
It's nice, you know?

38:07.939 --> 38:12.528
I didn't think Jules is never
really not working, you know?

38:12.528 --> 38:14.642
And I'm tryin' to get my stuff goin'

38:14.642 --> 38:18.523
and it's just not been good.
(Abby chuckling)

38:18.523 --> 38:22.356
Not been great, so it's
great to see you guys.

38:23.444 --> 38:24.950
Right?

38:24.950 --> 38:28.194
(Abby chuckling)
(Nate whispering)

38:28.194 --> 38:29.892
All right, I'm gonna head in.

38:29.892 --> 38:30.725
- Are you?
- Yeah.

38:30.725 --> 38:31.676
- Aw, man.

38:31.676 --> 38:32.509
Hey.

38:33.612 --> 38:35.037
- What?
- Happy birthday. (chuckles)

38:35.037 --> 38:37.720
- [Abby] (chuckles) Happy birthday.

38:37.720 --> 38:40.553
- All right, happy birthday to me.

38:42.269 --> 38:43.519
Happy birthday.

38:45.122 --> 38:47.342
- Isn't it so beautiful?

38:47.342 --> 38:48.175
- Yeah.

38:54.100 --> 38:56.183
- What's wrong?
- Nothin'.

39:00.832 --> 39:01.665
- 'Kay, you're obviously upset.

39:01.665 --> 39:02.998
What's going on?

39:06.307 --> 39:08.332
- I don't know, maybe
that your engaged friend

39:08.332 --> 39:10.406
is out there hooking up with your brother.

39:10.406 --> 39:13.594
- Really? (chuckles)

39:13.594 --> 39:14.973
- That's funny?

39:14.973 --> 39:16.063
- [Julia] It's not a big deal.

39:16.063 --> 39:17.294
- Not a big deal?

39:17.294 --> 39:18.127
- No.

39:20.904 --> 39:22.692
They split up.

39:22.692 --> 39:23.843
- What?

39:23.843 --> 39:25.344
- [Julia] Abby and Mitch split up.

39:25.344 --> 39:26.810
- Does Nate know that?

39:26.810 --> 39:28.937
- Yeah, I told him.

39:28.937 --> 39:32.668
- (scoffs) Unbelievable.

39:32.668 --> 39:34.959
Why didn't you tell me?

39:34.959 --> 39:37.162
- Because you would've told Tyler.

39:37.162 --> 39:38.317
- Oh, no no no no.

39:38.317 --> 39:39.424
Yeah, it's 'cause that would mess up

39:39.424 --> 39:41.098
your whole matchmaker weekend, right?

39:41.098 --> 39:43.387
- Why are you coming in here so nasty?

39:43.387 --> 39:44.648
You're like yelling at me.

39:44.648 --> 39:46.454
- Tyler tried to fuckin' kill himself

39:46.454 --> 39:47.870
when he found out that Abby was engaged.

39:47.870 --> 39:48.703
- What?

39:48.703 --> 39:49.601
- Oh, c'mon stop.

39:49.601 --> 39:50.785
You knew that.

39:50.785 --> 39:52.728
- You never told me that.
- You fuckin' knew.

39:52.728 --> 39:53.742
- How am I supposed to know that?

39:53.742 --> 39:54.774
- I didn't know Abby was gonna be coming

39:54.774 --> 39:56.461
on this fucking trip.

39:56.461 --> 39:58.238
I've been spending this entire weekend

39:58.238 --> 39:59.651
tryin' to make sure Tyler's okay

39:59.651 --> 40:01.355
and now--
- Oh my god.

40:01.355 --> 40:04.295
Okay, this whole weekend's
about you taking care of Tyler.

40:04.295 --> 40:05.128
Come on.

40:05.128 --> 40:06.856
This whole weekend is just
another reason for you

40:06.856 --> 40:08.773
to get fucked up again.

40:10.753 --> 40:11.586
- Wow.

40:11.586 --> 40:14.100
(soft foreboding music)

40:14.100 --> 40:14.933
Fuck you.

40:17.491 --> 40:18.324
- Wow.

40:37.081 --> 40:39.253
- It's so beautiful.

40:39.253 --> 40:42.164
- Yeah, everything is
just better out here.

40:42.164 --> 40:44.057
- You just feel happier.

40:44.057 --> 40:45.138
- Yeah.
(Abby chuckling)

40:45.138 --> 40:47.638
Yeah, everything looks better.

40:48.735 --> 40:50.985
- Everything sounds better.

40:52.121 --> 40:55.397
- Everything feels better.
- Feels better?

40:55.397 --> 40:56.346
Yeah.

40:56.346 --> 40:57.209
Yeah.

40:57.209 --> 41:00.227
(leaves rustling)
(soft foreboding music)

41:00.227 --> 41:02.240
- Oh my god.
- What?

41:02.240 --> 41:04.357
What are you doing?

41:04.357 --> 41:05.580
- I think somebody's
coming onto the property.

41:05.580 --> 41:07.083
- What? (chuckles)
- Yeah.

41:07.083 --> 41:08.707
- No.

41:08.707 --> 41:09.621
I think you're crazy.

41:09.621 --> 41:11.918
You're being ridiculous right now.

41:11.918 --> 41:16.918
(soft foreboding music)
(lips smacking)

41:20.639 --> 41:23.389
(water gurgling)

41:27.032 --> 41:29.954
- I had a really good
time with you tonight.

41:29.954 --> 41:30.787
- Me too.

41:31.748 --> 41:33.921
- I'll see you tomorrow?

41:33.921 --> 41:34.754
- Yeah.

41:34.754 --> 41:35.667
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:35.667 --> 41:36.500
- Okay.

41:39.249 --> 41:40.636
- I'm gonna go get changed.

41:40.636 --> 41:42.426
- All right.

41:42.426 --> 41:43.756
- Yeah.

41:43.756 --> 41:45.701
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

41:45.701 --> 41:49.034
(dark foreboding music)

42:29.223 --> 42:32.056

43:10.545 --> 43:13.462

43:53.125 --> 43:54.708
- This fuckin' guy.

44:18.990 --> 44:19.823
Hi.

44:21.275 --> 44:22.358
- [Julia] Hi.

44:23.876 --> 44:27.376
- Yikes.
(Julia chuckling)

44:29.776 --> 44:30.609
I'm sorry.

44:32.917 --> 44:33.917
- It's okay.

44:35.958 --> 44:39.208
- Just with the Margot thing and Tyler.

44:42.093 --> 44:45.359
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

44:45.359 --> 44:46.576
Sorry.

44:46.576 --> 44:48.532
- It's okay, I forgive you.

44:48.532 --> 44:50.032
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

44:50.974 --> 44:52.557
It's your birthday.

44:54.093 --> 44:57.438
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Abby.

44:57.438 --> 45:00.056
- [Winston] It's okay.

45:00.056 --> 45:01.478
- Did you sleep out there?

45:01.478 --> 45:03.061
- [Winston] Mm-hmm.

45:03.955 --> 45:05.503
- Do you wanna come to bed?

45:05.503 --> 45:06.336
- Mm-hmm.

45:09.970 --> 45:12.637
(lips smacking)

45:14.228 --> 45:16.895
(Julia wincing)

45:22.745 --> 45:24.888
- Did you sleep okay out there?

45:24.888 --> 45:27.665
- No, no.
(Julia chuckling softly)

45:27.665 --> 45:29.457
- I didn't really either.

45:29.457 --> 45:30.676
- You didn't?

45:30.676 --> 45:35.676
- No, there was like
(yawns) some weird popping.

45:39.381 --> 45:43.450
I don't know, it sounded like gunshots.

45:43.450 --> 45:44.283
- What?

45:52.771 --> 45:55.521
(wind whooshing)

45:57.743 --> 45:58.782
(cabinet door thudding)
(bowl clanking)

45:58.782 --> 46:00.949
- [Julia] What time is it?

46:06.526 --> 46:07.499
- 8:30.

46:07.499 --> 46:08.332
- Ooh.

46:17.973 --> 46:18.806
- Morning.

46:27.960 --> 46:28.793
You all right?

46:28.793 --> 46:30.082
You seemed a little weird last night.

46:30.082 --> 46:31.499
- No, just tired.

46:34.354 --> 46:35.187
- You sure?

46:35.187 --> 46:36.221
'Cause I came to your door.

46:36.221 --> 46:37.101
It was locked.

46:37.101 --> 46:38.363
Thought that was a little weird.

46:38.363 --> 46:39.781
- I was sleeping in a strange house.

46:39.781 --> 46:41.448
It's not that weird.

46:43.650 --> 46:44.483
- Mm-hmm.

46:45.938 --> 46:47.516
What is your deal?

46:47.516 --> 46:50.214
You won't text me back,
you won't call me back.

46:50.214 --> 46:52.216
You won't talk to me right now.

46:52.216 --> 46:55.133
- Way too early for this.
- Chewing.

47:05.367 --> 47:06.408
- [Automated Voice] Access denied.

47:06.408 --> 47:08.408
- Okay, for fuck's sake.

47:13.674 --> 47:17.088
(phone ringing)
(soft foreboding music)

47:17.088 --> 47:18.853
- [Doug] Door's locked on you?

47:18.853 --> 47:19.686
- Yeah, Doug.

47:19.686 --> 47:21.268
How'd you guess?

47:21.268 --> 47:22.302
- [Doug] Darn security system

47:22.302 --> 47:24.912
goes into full lockdown sometimes.

47:24.912 --> 47:26.504
- Security system?

47:26.504 --> 47:29.554
- [Doug] Maybe a coyote got in
the floodlight or somethin'.

47:29.554 --> 47:32.164
- Do I need to set something
up or how does this work?

47:32.164 --> 47:34.195
- [Doug] I showed you how to yesterday.

47:34.195 --> 47:35.489
- Pretty sure you didn't.

47:35.489 --> 47:36.744
- Access granted.
- Have you forgotten?

47:36.744 --> 47:39.244
It's definitely in the binder.

47:43.724 --> 47:47.936
If you need anything else,
I'm only a phone call away.

47:47.936 --> 47:49.186
- Thanks, Doug.

48:01.311 --> 48:04.250
(kettle whistling)

48:04.250 --> 48:05.297
- [Julia] Did I hear my tea?

48:05.297 --> 48:06.130
- Hey.

48:06.130 --> 48:06.963
Oh yeah, sorry.

48:06.963 --> 48:07.796
I got caught up cleaning.

48:07.796 --> 48:08.777
- That's okay.

48:08.777 --> 48:11.919
(kettle whistling)

48:11.919 --> 48:12.836
Margot, hi.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.438
We didn't see a lot of you last night.

48:16.438 --> 48:17.521
You were sad.

48:22.206 --> 48:26.902
- [Margot] Yo, who's that
random guy on the couch?

48:26.902 --> 48:27.735
- Oh, right.

48:27.735 --> 48:29.348
It's Abby's little friend, Joe.

48:29.348 --> 48:31.693
Remember she invited
him to spend the night?

48:31.693 --> 48:32.526
Yeah.

48:32.526 --> 48:33.713
No, this is great.

48:33.713 --> 48:36.463
What a fantastic idea all 'round.

48:37.621 --> 48:40.204
- Hey you got a new job, right?

48:41.220 --> 48:45.293
- I just make personalized
goods and sell them.

48:45.293 --> 48:47.082
If you wanna call it a job, sure.

48:47.082 --> 48:48.999
- Oh, that's like Etsy.

48:51.622 --> 48:52.865
- Yeah.

48:52.865 --> 48:53.698
Yeah.

48:53.698 --> 48:54.531
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

48:54.531 --> 48:55.801
- Good for you.

48:55.801 --> 48:57.925
What are you selling?

48:57.925 --> 49:01.945
- You know, I heard some
shouting by the pool last night.

49:01.945 --> 49:04.139
Like it was loud enough to wake me up.

49:04.139 --> 49:05.275
- Shouting?

49:05.275 --> 49:06.531
We didn't hear any shouting last night.

49:06.531 --> 49:07.903
Right, Jules?

49:07.903 --> 49:09.326
- Mm-mmm, no.

49:09.326 --> 49:11.134
I didn't hear shouting.
I heard like popping.

49:11.134 --> 49:12.551
- Oh my goodness.

49:13.801 --> 49:18.175
(grunts) I got real good last night.

49:18.175 --> 49:19.595
- How did we sleep?

49:19.595 --> 49:21.373
- [Nate] Oh, like a drunken log.

49:21.373 --> 49:23.080
- (chuckles) Okay.

49:23.080 --> 49:25.967
Do you wanna talk with
me outside real fast?

49:25.967 --> 49:27.355
- [Nate] Yeah, okay.

49:27.355 --> 49:29.808
- Did you hookup with Abby?

49:29.808 --> 49:30.641
- What?

49:30.641 --> 49:31.474
Yes.

49:31.474 --> 49:32.307
- You did?

49:32.307 --> 49:33.140
- You told me to.

49:33.140 --> 49:34.633
- Okay, well I'm not like your pimp.

49:34.633 --> 49:36.842
- Okay, but like you know.

49:36.842 --> 49:38.757
- Yeah.
- Your boy closed.

49:38.757 --> 49:40.636
Sealed the deal.
- Okay.

49:40.636 --> 49:42.053
That feels weird.

49:43.614 --> 49:45.154
- I have to tell you something.

49:45.154 --> 49:46.414
- Okay.

49:46.414 --> 49:48.003
- Do you promise not to freak out?

49:48.003 --> 49:49.601
- It depends.

49:49.601 --> 49:50.890
- No, we can't do that.

49:50.890 --> 49:52.507
You have to either say yes or no.

49:52.507 --> 49:54.672
I can't tell you unless you promise.

49:54.672 --> 49:56.309
- Okay, I promise.

49:56.309 --> 49:57.764
- You know Tyler?

49:57.764 --> 49:58.860
- [Nate] Yeah.

49:58.860 --> 50:03.777
- He tried to kill himself over
Abby's engagement to Mitch.

50:06.656 --> 50:07.498
- What?

50:07.498 --> 50:09.331
When?
- Yeah, recently.

50:10.670 --> 50:11.892
- Are you kidding me?

50:11.892 --> 50:12.725
- Yeah.

50:12.725 --> 50:14.598
- Why wasn't that brought
to my attention before?

50:14.598 --> 50:15.431
- I don't know.

50:15.431 --> 50:16.292
I just found out.

50:16.292 --> 50:17.552
- Oh my god.
- I know.

50:17.552 --> 50:19.214
- [Nate] Man, I can't go for it now.

50:19.214 --> 50:20.047
- Yes, you can.

50:20.047 --> 50:20.880
Yes, you can.
- No way.

50:20.880 --> 50:21.839
- I love her.

50:21.839 --> 50:22.672
Everybody loves her.

50:22.672 --> 50:25.014
She's a great girl and
you can continue this.

50:25.014 --> 50:28.048
Just like keep it
together for this weekend.

50:28.048 --> 50:30.092
It's not a big deal.

50:30.092 --> 50:31.958
- Oh man, well Jesus.

50:31.958 --> 50:33.630
- Can you do that for me?

50:33.630 --> 50:35.096
- Yeah, I mean you know I will.

50:35.096 --> 50:36.182
- Thank you.

50:36.182 --> 50:37.182
- It just sucks, you know?

50:37.182 --> 50:39.138
Like knowing that

50:39.138 --> 50:40.671
and then this whole
weekend's gonna be ruined.

50:40.671 --> 50:42.373
I saw this guy in the bushes last night

50:42.373 --> 50:44.012
when I was makin' out with Abby.

50:44.012 --> 50:45.028
- What?

50:45.028 --> 50:46.460
- [Nate] Yeah, yeah.

50:46.460 --> 50:47.458
I didn't tell you that?

50:47.458 --> 50:48.352
- No.

50:48.352 --> 50:51.438
- Yeah, we're in the hot tub
and like I was leanin' in

50:51.438 --> 50:53.328
and I saw somethin' behind her.

50:53.328 --> 50:54.319
There was like a guy.
- You saw a guy?

50:54.319 --> 50:55.466
- [Nate] I mean it looked like a guy.

50:55.466 --> 50:56.299
- You know what's so weird?

50:56.299 --> 50:59.076
I thought I was hearing like gunshots,

50:59.076 --> 51:00.005
it's what it sounded like.

51:00.005 --> 51:01.587
It was like popping.

51:01.587 --> 51:03.171
- Out here?
- Yeah.

51:03.171 --> 51:05.412
- The fuck is going on here?

51:05.412 --> 51:06.956
- I have no idea.

51:06.956 --> 51:08.839
(door squeaking)
(Julia wincing)

51:08.839 --> 51:10.505
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

51:10.505 --> 51:11.338
- Hey, dawg.
- How're you doin', man?

51:11.338 --> 51:12.171
- How're you doin'?

51:12.171 --> 51:13.004
Enjoy your b-day.

51:13.004 --> 51:13.837
- Yes.

51:13.837 --> 51:15.110
Hi, honey.
- Hi.

51:15.110 --> 51:16.193
- Hey, man.

51:16.193 --> 51:17.224
- [Tyler] Hey.

51:17.224 --> 51:18.807
- How're you doin'?
- I'm good.

51:18.807 --> 51:19.640
- There's the guy.

51:19.640 --> 51:21.481
How're you doin', bud?

51:21.481 --> 51:22.370
- I'm good.

51:22.370 --> 51:23.203
- Did you get some sleep?

51:23.203 --> 51:24.533
- Yeah.

51:24.533 --> 51:25.366
Where's Margot at?

51:25.366 --> 51:26.846
Is she up yet or what's up?

51:26.846 --> 51:28.563
- Margot is in her room.

51:28.563 --> 51:29.396
- Ah 'kay.

51:32.902 --> 51:34.402
Is anyone hungry?

51:34.402 --> 51:35.235
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51:35.235 --> 51:36.799
- Starving actually.
- You hungry?

51:36.799 --> 51:37.776
- I saw a grill outside.

51:37.776 --> 51:40.348
Thinkin' we could grill up a
little lunch, some hamburgers.

51:40.348 --> 51:41.433
- Which'd be good.
- Yeah?

51:41.433 --> 51:42.540
- [Nate] Yeah.

51:42.540 --> 51:43.438
- Okie-doke.

51:43.438 --> 51:44.438
- All right.

51:45.851 --> 51:46.684
- Here we go.

51:46.684 --> 51:47.774
Let's get this baby fired up.

51:47.774 --> 51:52.607
- It's probably (claps) the Clapper, huh?

51:54.181 --> 51:55.014
Grill on.

51:57.037 --> 51:57.870
- [Nate] You boys need help?

51:57.870 --> 51:58.703
- Nope, we got it.

51:58.703 --> 52:00.086
- No thank you.

52:00.086 --> 52:01.341
- [Nate] Old Nathaniel knows his way

52:01.341 --> 52:03.686
around the old propane grills.

52:03.686 --> 52:05.713
- Why don't you just stare
at a rock for a while, buddy?

52:05.713 --> 52:07.839
- Why's everything gotta be
very complicated in this house?

52:07.839 --> 52:08.965
- [Nate] Been doin' that all day.

52:08.965 --> 52:10.708
- It's fine, it's not.

52:10.708 --> 52:13.478
- (yawns) Hey, everybody.

52:13.478 --> 52:14.311
- Hi, Joe.

52:14.311 --> 52:15.144
- What's goin' on?

52:15.144 --> 52:16.722
Oh birthday grillin' feast, huh?

52:16.722 --> 52:18.221
- Yeah, well tryin'.

52:18.221 --> 52:20.040
- Havin' a little trouble?

52:20.040 --> 52:22.839
It's certainly not too hard.

52:22.839 --> 52:23.672
Here you go.

52:23.672 --> 52:25.524
Turn that one on too if you want it.

52:25.524 --> 52:28.004
Pretty simple, but it
does throw a lotta people.

52:28.004 --> 52:30.006
So again, don't feel too bad.

52:30.006 --> 52:32.626
(sighs) Table of champion.
- Bazooka Joe.

52:32.626 --> 52:33.459
- Hi.

52:33.459 --> 52:34.292
- So you're dumb.

52:34.292 --> 52:36.414
- Hi.
- And you are?

52:36.414 --> 52:37.247
- [Joe] I like your necklace.

52:37.247 --> 52:38.168
- Oh okay, nice to meet you.

52:38.168 --> 52:39.001
- [Joe] I'm Joseph.

52:39.001 --> 52:41.207
- [Margot] Thank you, Margot.

52:41.207 --> 52:43.653
- I don't know, you shoulda
seen her this morning.

52:43.653 --> 52:45.748
She was being fucking crazy to me.

52:45.748 --> 52:46.752
- Margot?
- It's so weird.

52:46.752 --> 52:47.585
Yes.

52:48.858 --> 52:50.939
- I'd let it go, man.

52:50.939 --> 52:51.772
She's fine.

52:51.772 --> 52:54.828
She was goin' through a little
bit of a thing this year.

52:54.828 --> 52:55.661
- [Winston] She was?

52:55.661 --> 52:58.119
- Yeah, she had to borrow a
little bit of money from me.

52:58.119 --> 52:59.326
But she paid me back right away.

52:59.326 --> 53:00.947
- What?
- And she's good.

53:00.947 --> 53:02.151
- She borrowed money from you?

53:02.151 --> 53:02.984
- Yeah.

53:02.984 --> 53:04.018
- Why would she borrow money from you?

53:04.018 --> 53:04.851
Why didn't she ask me?

53:04.851 --> 53:05.684
I make more money than you.

53:05.684 --> 53:08.709
- It's not about how much
money a person makes.

53:08.709 --> 53:11.890
Just you guys aren't close right now.

53:11.890 --> 53:13.712
- That's not true.

53:13.712 --> 53:14.848
We used to talk all the time.

53:14.848 --> 53:15.765
- You used to talk.

53:15.765 --> 53:16.938
- Exactly, so what's going on?

53:16.938 --> 53:18.977
- Okay, I'd like to let it go.

53:18.977 --> 53:19.828
- Let it go.
- It's fine.

53:19.828 --> 53:22.441
She's fine, you're fine, everyone's fine.

53:22.441 --> 53:24.046
- Okay.

53:24.046 --> 53:24.879
Okay.

53:24.879 --> 53:26.046
- Okay?
- Yeah.

53:27.450 --> 53:28.775
- I think I'm gonna go.

53:28.775 --> 53:31.275
- You are?
- Yeah, after lunch.

53:33.547 --> 53:35.471
- Come on, my birthday weekend.

53:35.471 --> 53:37.764
- I fucking can't, dude.

53:37.764 --> 53:38.597
- All right, it's okay.

53:38.597 --> 53:39.430
I get it.

53:39.430 --> 53:40.263
- I'm sorry.

53:40.263 --> 53:41.096
- No, it's totally fine.

53:41.096 --> 53:42.253
- I'm sorry, man.

53:42.253 --> 53:43.086
- Don't worry 'bout it.

53:43.086 --> 53:44.030
I get it.

53:44.030 --> 53:45.735
And also the last thing
I'm gonna say about it,

53:45.735 --> 53:47.320
she's definitely hiding something.

53:47.320 --> 53:48.976
- Let's let that be the last
thing you say about that.

53:48.976 --> 53:50.132
- Done.

53:50.132 --> 53:52.453
Done and burgers are done.

53:52.453 --> 53:54.048
- Done.

53:54.048 --> 53:54.881
- Okay.

53:54.881 --> 53:56.477
All right, here we go.

53:56.477 --> 53:58.630
- Ooh, baby boy.

53:58.630 --> 53:59.881
All right.

53:59.881 --> 54:01.797
Those look great.

54:01.797 --> 54:03.636
Hey Emeril, thumbs up.

54:03.636 --> 54:04.928
- Oh, thank you.

54:04.928 --> 54:09.678
- Oh, I'm gonna wake up Abby
and tell her lunch is ready.

54:10.525 --> 54:13.858
(soft foreboding music)

54:14.958 --> 54:15.791
Abby?

54:27.938 --> 54:29.194
- [Abby] Hey, you've reached Abby.

54:29.194 --> 54:30.027
Sorry I couldn't get to the phone.

54:30.027 --> 54:35.027
Leave me a message and I'll
call you back as soon as I can.

54:35.191 --> 54:36.387
- I'll tell you if I did jujitsu,

54:36.387 --> 54:38.393
I could crack someone open.

54:38.393 --> 54:40.056
- Well, you gotta get class first.

54:40.056 --> 54:41.684
- Have any of you seen Abby?

54:41.684 --> 54:43.711
I can't find her.

54:43.711 --> 54:44.544
- No.

54:44.544 --> 54:45.767
- Did she sleep in your room last night?

54:45.767 --> 54:47.955
- No, I don't even know
her last name, dude.

54:47.955 --> 54:50.288
Why would she sleep with me?

54:51.482 --> 54:53.109
- Is she in the bathroom or somethin'?

54:53.109 --> 54:55.109
- No, I looked all over.

54:56.329 --> 54:58.132
- Nate, would you possibly have any idea

54:58.132 --> 55:00.382
where she slept last night?

55:01.228 --> 55:04.141
- I mean, I can tell you
where she didn't sleep

55:04.141 --> 55:06.132
'cause she didn't sleep with us.

55:06.132 --> 55:07.863
- [Joe] Maybe she
slept-walk the whole night.

55:07.863 --> 55:09.117
- So nobody knows?

55:09.117 --> 55:10.958
- Still give a solid eight if
you're walkin' all the time.

55:10.958 --> 55:12.248
- I'll come help you find her.

55:12.248 --> 55:13.985
- Thank you.

55:13.985 --> 55:14.923
Is she over there?

55:14.923 --> 55:17.300
- No and her luggage is missing too.

55:17.300 --> 55:18.846
- Her luggage is missing?

55:18.846 --> 55:20.023
- [Winston] It's not here.

55:20.023 --> 55:21.528
- Well where could she be?

55:21.528 --> 55:22.361
- I don't know.

55:22.361 --> 55:25.059
She's gotta be here somewhere.

55:25.059 --> 55:26.060
- I don't feel like she's here.

55:26.060 --> 55:28.561
I feel like we've
searched the whole house.

55:28.561 --> 55:33.561
(gravel crunching)
(soft foreboding music)

55:42.944 --> 55:45.258
- That was very filling.

55:45.258 --> 55:47.008
- We cannot find her.

55:48.379 --> 55:49.760
- Margot this might sound weird,

55:49.760 --> 55:52.182
but I think maybe Abby took your car.

55:52.182 --> 55:53.229
- I Ubered here.

55:53.229 --> 55:54.186
I didn't drive.

55:54.186 --> 55:55.019
- [Winston] What?

55:55.019 --> 55:56.214
- So that's not really possible.

55:56.214 --> 55:58.396
- You took an Uber from LA?

55:58.396 --> 55:59.300
- [Margot] Yeah.

55:59.300 --> 56:02.259
- (chuckles softly) Why?

56:02.259 --> 56:03.671
- [Margot] I didn't feel like driving.

56:03.671 --> 56:05.620
- So you took a 2 1/2 hour Uber?

56:05.620 --> 56:06.661
- Can we just focus up here?

56:06.661 --> 56:09.639
I'm a little concerned
about my missing friend.

56:09.639 --> 56:13.689
- Okay, I got up and went to bed at 5:30

56:13.689 --> 56:15.149
and the house was on lockdown

56:15.149 --> 56:19.144
'til the security system
turned off at nine.

56:19.144 --> 56:20.283
- Okay.
- All right.

56:20.283 --> 56:21.116
- And then.

56:21.116 --> 56:22.205
- What time did you go to bed?

56:22.205 --> 56:26.288
- I mean, I came in from
the hot tub around 2:30-3.

56:27.380 --> 56:28.478
Straight to bed.

56:28.478 --> 56:31.756
- So somewhere between three and 5:30.

56:31.756 --> 56:33.945
- All right, this might
sound kind of crazy.

56:33.945 --> 56:38.024
What if she got kidnapped by
the drug cartel or somethin'?

56:38.024 --> 56:38.979
We're in like meth country right now.

56:38.979 --> 56:39.812
- Oh come on.

56:39.812 --> 56:42.439
I mean, I told you this is
a sleepy old folks town.

56:42.439 --> 56:44.180
- Honestly, she probably
just went into town.

56:44.180 --> 56:46.462
That's like the most
realistic option here.

56:46.462 --> 56:49.197
- No, she was drinking a
lot and she never drinks.

56:49.197 --> 56:51.035
She probably, I don't know,

56:51.035 --> 56:53.613
if anything she wandered
off into the desert.

56:53.613 --> 56:55.317
- Well, that would be very bad

56:55.317 --> 56:57.104
if she wandered off into the desert alone

56:57.104 --> 56:58.653
because that's usually a one-way trip

56:58.653 --> 57:00.394
unless you know what you're doing.

57:00.394 --> 57:04.507
I happen to have a desert
survival pack that I will go get.

57:04.507 --> 57:06.225
I see you all looking
very nervous right now

57:06.225 --> 57:08.636
and I'm taking that energy
and I'm gonna collect it

57:08.636 --> 57:10.266
and hold that burden for you

57:10.266 --> 57:12.351
and send out some positivity real quick.

57:12.351 --> 57:13.679
Okay, I'll be right back.

57:13.679 --> 57:18.659
Nothin' to worry about.
(imitates blasting)

57:18.659 --> 57:20.950
- Okay, no one thinks he's at
least a little bit suspicious.

57:20.950 --> 57:23.895
No one thinks that's weird at all.

57:23.895 --> 57:26.739
- Like I said last night he's
a goof, but he's harmless.

57:26.739 --> 57:28.084
He slept on our couch the whole night.

57:28.084 --> 57:29.306
- I don't think it's a coincidence, man.

57:29.306 --> 57:30.767
He's the only person
here that we don't know

57:30.767 --> 57:32.603
and all of a sudden Abby's missing.

57:32.603 --> 57:35.279
And if someone did something
to Abby, it would be that guy.

57:35.279 --> 57:37.391
- Who said anyone did anything to her?

57:37.391 --> 57:40.724
(soft foreboding music)

57:43.596 --> 57:44.847
- [Nate] Sounds very wide.

57:44.847 --> 57:46.073
(Tyler drowned out by doorknob clacking)

57:46.073 --> 57:46.906
- All right, guys.

57:46.906 --> 57:48.899
Do not worry, Joe is back

57:48.899 --> 57:50.409
and I got the gear to find Abby.

57:50.409 --> 57:51.576
- [Tyler] Dear god.

57:51.576 --> 57:54.162
- Okay, I got some stuff
to illuminate our path

57:54.162 --> 57:56.692
in case that beating sun
doesn't do the trick.

57:56.692 --> 57:58.326
Couple extra flashlights.

57:58.326 --> 58:00.234
All right, Sport Sunscreen Spray.

58:00.234 --> 58:01.067
That's very important.

58:01.067 --> 58:04.176
We're gonna wanna keep our
bodies protected from the sun.

58:04.176 --> 58:05.243
This here, very important.

58:05.243 --> 58:07.733
This'll suck poison outta anything, okay?

58:07.733 --> 58:10.543
Do not let anyone tell you to
suck it out with their mouths.

58:10.543 --> 58:13.694
Now I got three bottles of water here.

58:13.694 --> 58:15.034
All right and this right here

58:15.034 --> 58:16.738
is not just a fun-looking keychain.

58:16.738 --> 58:17.852
This is a flint stick.

58:17.852 --> 58:18.871
Chink, chink, chink.

58:18.871 --> 58:20.109
Fire, okay?

58:20.109 --> 58:20.942
All right.

58:20.942 --> 58:21.821
Well, who's with me?

58:21.821 --> 58:23.992
Margot, just the two of
us out in the desert?

58:23.992 --> 58:25.666
Could be fun.

58:25.666 --> 58:27.491
- I really appreciate you thinking of me,

58:27.491 --> 58:29.314
but no, absolutely not.

58:29.314 --> 58:30.823
- All right, moving on.

58:30.823 --> 58:31.677
Winston?

58:31.677 --> 58:33.024
- [Julia] We're driving into town.

58:33.024 --> 58:33.857
- Oh, that's great.

58:33.857 --> 58:34.690
You'll love it there.

58:34.690 --> 58:36.080
It's beautiful.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.503
- [Julia] Thank you.

58:37.503 --> 58:40.955
- So looks like it's
the three amigos, huh?

58:40.955 --> 58:42.421
I'm just glad you guys
are gettin' a chance

58:42.421 --> 58:44.828
to see our little community.

58:44.828 --> 58:46.419
- [Nate] So you're writin' more, man.

58:46.419 --> 58:47.303
That's cool.

58:47.303 --> 58:48.789
- Yeah, man.

58:48.789 --> 58:49.651
It's been good.

58:49.651 --> 58:50.778
This trip's kinda nice, you know?

58:50.778 --> 58:53.543
- Dinosaurs come here
to fertilize their eggs.

58:53.543 --> 58:56.480
- Writing's important
to like observe people

58:56.480 --> 59:01.052
and there's a lot of fascinating
characters on this trip.

59:01.052 --> 59:02.467
- She's still not answering her phone.

59:02.467 --> 59:03.739
- I'm sure she's fine.

59:03.739 --> 59:04.788
- She probably went into town

59:04.788 --> 59:06.567
to call whatever the fuck his name is.

59:06.567 --> 59:08.060
- [Winston] Why wouldn't
she just use her cellphone?

59:08.060 --> 59:09.721
- 'Cause there's no service.

59:09.721 --> 59:12.383
It's like 10 miles away in
the middle of the night.

59:12.383 --> 59:15.890
(soft intriguing music)
(ignition whirring)

59:15.890 --> 59:17.751
- [Winston] And the car won't start.

59:17.751 --> 59:18.910
- You fuckin' serious?
- What?

59:18.910 --> 59:19.871
- [Winston] Yeah, I don't know.

59:19.871 --> 59:21.394
I had a half a tank yesterday.

59:21.394 --> 59:23.398
- [Margot] Did you leave the
lights on overnight, dude?

59:23.398 --> 59:26.406
- [Winston] No I didn't leave
the lights on overnight, dude.

59:26.406 --> 59:27.902
- [Julia] Do you want my
brother to take a look?

59:27.902 --> 59:29.260
- Your brother?
- He's good with cars.

59:29.260 --> 59:30.093
- Oh, your brother's good with cars?

59:30.093 --> 59:30.926
- [Julia] Yes.

59:30.926 --> 59:32.956
- Your brother doesn't know
shit about cars.

59:32.956 --> 59:36.694
- [Julia] Goddammit,
this is just what we need.

59:36.694 --> 59:37.861
- Shit.
- What?

59:41.704 --> 59:42.537
What?

59:49.096 --> 59:50.351
Is that hers?

59:50.351 --> 59:53.251
- [Julia] (sighs) Yes.

59:53.251 --> 59:55.984
- Emergence of Airbnb, VRBO.

59:55.984 --> 59:57.737
One guy named Sneaky Pat tried to open up

59:57.737 --> 01:00:01.099
just a bunch of mats on the ground.

01:00:01.099 --> 01:00:04.220
So you know, we've had a
lotta extra income comin' in.

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.373
Doug's making good money,

01:00:05.373 --> 01:00:07.213
but not everybody's thrilled about it.

01:00:07.213 --> 01:00:10.305
I mean I personally love
you kids comin' in from LA

01:00:10.305 --> 01:00:12.104
and you know, show your wild side off.

01:00:12.104 --> 01:00:14.428
But a lotta people are
tryin' to get you all banned

01:00:14.428 --> 01:00:15.915
from being here.

01:00:15.915 --> 01:00:17.745
- I don't understand that.

01:00:17.745 --> 01:00:20.495
- Yeah, it seems wrong to me too.

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:24.407
- I'm just gonna go to my room.

01:00:24.407 --> 01:00:25.731
- I'm gonna try and call Abby.

01:00:25.731 --> 01:00:26.977
- Okay.

01:00:26.977 --> 01:00:30.310
(soft intriguing music)

01:00:48.207 --> 01:00:50.874
(phone ringing)

01:00:51.716 --> 01:00:55.512
- [Brent] (chuckles) Okay, okay, hold on.

01:00:55.512 --> 01:00:56.616
Hey, what's up, man?

01:00:56.616 --> 01:00:58.392
How's the hangover, dude?

01:00:58.392 --> 01:00:59.723
- Hey guys, how's it goin'?

01:00:59.723 --> 01:01:01.874
- [Brent] Hey, that drunk hits
you really hard out here.

01:01:01.874 --> 01:01:02.763
It's the dehydration.

01:01:02.763 --> 01:01:04.536
If you're not used to it, the dryness,

01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:06.747
it gets you really hard out here.

01:01:06.747 --> 01:01:07.823
- Right.

01:01:07.823 --> 01:01:10.530
Listen, we got a bit of a problem here.

01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:13.857
- [Brent] What's goin' on, man?

01:01:13.857 --> 01:01:15.279
- This is gonna sound crazy.

01:01:15.279 --> 01:01:18.425
We can't find one of our friends.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:19.883
- [Brent] What do you
mean you can't find them?

01:01:19.883 --> 01:01:21.912
- We woke up and she's just gone.

01:01:21.912 --> 01:01:23.399
We think she may have gone into town,

01:01:23.399 --> 01:01:24.566
but nobody knows where she is.

01:01:24.566 --> 01:01:25.554
- [Brent] Holy shit, LA.

01:01:25.554 --> 01:01:27.806
Well hey, you did the right
thing by callin' us first.

01:01:27.806 --> 01:01:28.827
If you had called the sheriff,

01:01:28.827 --> 01:01:31.513
things would be much, much worse by now.

01:01:31.513 --> 01:01:33.885
- That's exactly what I was
thinking, so I called you guys.

01:01:33.885 --> 01:01:35.888
We were gonna go into town,
but the car won't start.

01:01:35.888 --> 01:01:36.749
- [Brent] What?

01:01:36.749 --> 01:01:38.124
- [Chip] Oh, man.

01:01:38.124 --> 01:01:39.459
I hate it when that happens.

01:01:39.459 --> 01:01:40.292
That's the worst.

01:01:40.292 --> 01:01:41.125
- [Brent] That's not good.

01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:42.733
- We don't really know what to do here.

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:45.225
- [Brent] Well shit,
we're like all the way

01:01:45.225 --> 01:01:47.424
out here in Hemet right now
takin' care of some business.

01:01:47.424 --> 01:01:48.753
But we can call Tony,

01:01:48.753 --> 01:01:50.726
see if he can give you a tow into town.

01:01:50.726 --> 01:01:52.392
- Tony?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:01:52.392 --> 01:01:53.581
He's the only shop in
town with a tow truck.

01:01:53.581 --> 01:01:55.697
Really good guy.
- [Chip] He's a great guy, great guy.

01:01:55.697 --> 01:01:56.530
Best guy I know.

01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:57.363
- [Brent] We'll call him up

01:01:57.363 --> 01:02:00.623
and tell him to get
over there to you ASAP.

01:02:00.623 --> 01:02:01.559
- Yeah, that would awesome.

01:02:01.559 --> 01:02:02.661
Thank you guys so much.

01:02:02.661 --> 01:02:04.229
- [Brent] Yeah you got it, good buddy.

01:02:04.229 --> 01:02:05.080
Good luck, LA.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.633
- Thank you so much.

01:02:06.633 --> 01:02:07.883
All right, bye.

01:02:08.901 --> 01:02:09.907
- What'd they say?

01:02:09.907 --> 01:02:13.865
- Well, they're gonna send a tow truck.

01:02:13.865 --> 01:02:16.203
- Okay, should we call the cops?

01:02:16.203 --> 01:02:17.580
- Call the cops?

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.596
- [Julia] Yeah.

01:02:18.596 --> 01:02:20.355
- No, I don't think we need to overreact.

01:02:20.355 --> 01:02:21.188
This is gonna be fine.

01:02:21.188 --> 01:02:24.158
We're gonna get into town.

01:02:24.158 --> 01:02:25.466
We don't need to overreact.

01:02:25.466 --> 01:02:26.828
These guys are takin'
care of it, all right?

01:02:26.828 --> 01:02:27.995
- I'm worried.

01:02:30.973 --> 01:02:32.877
This: again, I know I sound crazy,

01:02:32.877 --> 01:02:35.970
but I have to just speak it out loud.

01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:38.672
But I just can't get what you told me

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:41.784
last night outta my head about Tyler.

01:02:41.784 --> 01:02:45.506
You don't think he'd like
do anything to her, do you?

01:02:45.506 --> 01:02:46.339
- What do you mean?

01:02:46.339 --> 01:02:48.260
You think he like hurt her?

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:49.776
- No, no, no.

01:02:49.776 --> 01:02:51.761
Not hurt her, just I don't know.

01:02:51.761 --> 01:02:54.018
He's obviously very fragile right now

01:02:54.018 --> 01:02:55.878
and he's like locked in on her.

01:02:55.878 --> 01:02:58.102
- No look, Tyler's not
capable of hurting anybody.

01:02:58.102 --> 01:02:59.725
We're all friends here.

01:02:59.725 --> 01:03:00.735
Nothing like that happened.

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.565
I'm positive.

01:03:02.565 --> 01:03:03.565
Okay?
- Okay.

01:03:04.443 --> 01:03:06.491
- Wanna take a shower?
- Yeah.

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:07.718
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:03:07.718 --> 01:03:10.232
- I'm gonna try to talk to Margot.

01:03:10.232 --> 01:03:12.815
- Good luck with that.
- I know.

01:03:15.529 --> 01:03:19.634
- So is this like drug cartel land, man?

01:03:19.634 --> 01:03:20.479
- Nah, no way, man.

01:03:20.479 --> 01:03:23.179
You been watchin' way too much cable TV.

01:03:23.179 --> 01:03:25.914
This is as innocent as apple pie out here.

01:03:25.914 --> 01:03:27.743
Although, we did have a dog stealin' bacon

01:03:27.743 --> 01:03:28.576
from the local diner,

01:03:28.576 --> 01:03:31.869
so I guess they don't all
go to Heaven. (chuckles)

01:03:31.869 --> 01:03:33.059
- [Nate] I don't know, man.

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:36.962
I feel like I get a
gritty-meth vibe out here.

01:03:36.962 --> 01:03:39.420
- [Joe] Oh no, I don't
think that's the case.

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:40.753
- Hey, you guys.

01:03:42.039 --> 01:03:42.872
Bullet shells.

01:03:42.872 --> 01:03:44.385
- Oh, there are a lotta hunters out here

01:03:44.385 --> 01:03:45.786
and it is buck season.

01:03:45.786 --> 01:03:47.944
- A lotta people hunting with pistols.

01:03:47.944 --> 01:03:49.801
- Sometimes you gotta
shoot 'em execution-style

01:03:49.801 --> 01:03:51.027
to prove your point.

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:51.860
- I don't know, man.

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:52.747
I think this is weird.

01:03:52.747 --> 01:03:54.767
- [Nate] Yeah that does
seem kinda weird, Joe.

01:03:54.767 --> 01:03:55.600
- Hey, you guys.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.730
I think we should just
go up this way, honestly.

01:03:56.730 --> 01:03:58.275
There's a little shortcut.

01:03:58.275 --> 01:03:59.108
- [Nate] Yeah, but.

01:03:59.108 --> 01:03:59.941
- Let's get back to the house.

01:03:59.941 --> 01:04:01.120
- [Nate] We came from this way, didn't we?

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.496
- Yeah, the thing is that there's a lot of

01:04:03.496 --> 01:04:04.805
slips and falls that way.

01:04:04.805 --> 01:04:06.914
And if you just go up this
way, it's a clear path.

01:04:06.914 --> 01:04:11.664
Honestly, it's in your best
interest to just go this way.

01:04:13.857 --> 01:04:16.524
(door knocking)

01:04:23.021 --> 01:04:26.085
- Hey, can we talk for a second?

01:04:26.085 --> 01:04:26.918
- Sure.

01:04:27.999 --> 01:04:29.120
- Can I come in?

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:29.953
- No.

01:04:31.329 --> 01:04:32.162
- Okay.

01:04:33.966 --> 01:04:35.419
Tyler mentioned that you're goin' through

01:04:35.419 --> 01:04:36.409
a bit of a rough patch,

01:04:36.409 --> 01:04:38.371
so I just wanted to talk to you

01:04:38.371 --> 01:04:42.621
and let you know that I'm
a friend and I wanna help

01:04:44.851 --> 01:04:45.702
if you just talk to me.

01:04:45.702 --> 01:04:47.724
- Yeah, so now you wanna
be a fucking friend?

01:04:47.724 --> 01:04:48.557
- What?

01:04:48.557 --> 01:04:50.928
- You knew I lost my job and
the first time I hear from you

01:04:50.928 --> 01:04:52.077
is for your birthday weekend?

01:04:52.077 --> 01:04:54.273
- That's not true.
- What about Tyler?

01:04:54.273 --> 01:04:55.106
I'm the one who's been there

01:04:55.106 --> 01:04:56.340
for every fucking mental breakdown

01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:58.237
and every phone call at three a.m.

01:04:58.237 --> 01:04:59.070
- [Winston] Okay, you know what?

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:01.079
- He calls you the day
that he attempts suicide

01:05:01.079 --> 01:05:02.050
and you didn't fucking answer.

01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:02.883
- [Winston] That's not what this is about.

01:05:02.883 --> 01:05:03.716
- But what, you pick
him up from the hospital

01:05:03.716 --> 01:05:05.004
and now you get to be a fucking friend?

01:05:05.004 --> 01:05:06.553
- It's not what this is about.
- That's what this is?

01:05:06.553 --> 01:05:08.182
- No, that's not what this is.

01:05:08.182 --> 01:05:10.192
I wanna talk to you because
ever since you've gotten here,

01:05:10.192 --> 01:05:11.872
you been so fucking weird.

01:05:11.872 --> 01:05:13.271
You took an Uber here.

01:05:13.271 --> 01:05:14.647
You're guarding your
door and your luggage.

01:05:14.647 --> 01:05:15.486
I haven't talked to you in a month.

01:05:15.486 --> 01:05:16.319
- You know what?

01:05:16.319 --> 01:05:17.480
This entire fucking weekend
was supposed to be canceled

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.162
and you knew that, but
you wanna make it Tyler.

01:05:19.162 --> 01:05:19.995
No, it's about you.

01:05:19.995 --> 01:05:21.570
It's about you doing
drugs, getting fucked up.

01:05:21.570 --> 01:05:22.966
- That's fuckin' bullshit.

01:05:22.966 --> 01:05:23.799
That's bullshit.

01:05:23.799 --> 01:05:24.632
You know what?

01:05:24.632 --> 01:05:25.465
You're hiding something.

01:05:25.465 --> 01:05:28.161
- I will fucking scream.

01:05:28.161 --> 01:05:30.578
- [Nate] Honeys, we're home.

01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:36.517
(door slamming)

01:05:38.091 --> 01:05:40.924
(Winston sighing)

01:05:42.068 --> 01:05:45.017
- Yeah, I mean the block seems pretty good

01:05:45.017 --> 01:05:47.267
and belts are all lubed up.

01:05:48.372 --> 01:05:49.662
You know, I'm gonna level with you, man.

01:05:49.662 --> 01:05:51.217
I'm used to American muscle.

01:05:51.217 --> 01:05:53.237
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

01:05:53.237 --> 01:05:57.522
- Okay well, we'll tell
Julia you put on a good show.

01:05:57.522 --> 01:05:58.355
C'mon.

01:05:58.355 --> 01:05:59.613
- I mean it's gotta be somethin', right?

01:05:59.613 --> 01:06:01.867
- [Winston] Definitely something.

01:06:01.867 --> 01:06:03.034
- God dang it.

01:06:04.101 --> 01:06:09.101
(door squeaking)
(water blooping)

01:06:15.419 --> 01:06:17.836
- Hey.
- Hey, what's goin' on?

01:06:20.218 --> 01:06:22.501
- You know, kinda freaked out.

01:06:22.501 --> 01:06:24.460
How're you doin'?
- I'm doin' good.

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:26.104
I'm a little tired from that hike.

01:06:26.104 --> 01:06:27.543
- Yeah.

01:06:27.543 --> 01:06:31.219
- All things considered, I guess I'm fine.

01:06:31.219 --> 01:06:32.349
- You're fine.

01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:33.485
- Yeah.

01:06:33.485 --> 01:06:36.373
- I'm very concerned about Abby.

01:06:36.373 --> 01:06:37.411
- Yeah, me too.

01:06:37.411 --> 01:06:38.244
- Yeah.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:39.991
- I hope she's okay.

01:06:39.991 --> 01:06:42.241
- Yeah, you're freaked out?

01:06:43.306 --> 01:06:44.712
- Yeah, I mean

01:06:44.712 --> 01:06:47.115
we didn't really catch a
trace of her out there.

01:06:47.115 --> 01:06:50.906
- You guys were looking pretty hard.

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:52.739
- Yeah, yeah, as hard as one can look

01:06:52.739 --> 01:06:54.989
at a bunch of fuckin' sand.

01:06:56.651 --> 01:06:58.321
- Well, I'm really concerned

01:06:58.321 --> 01:07:00.834
'cause obviously she means a lot to me.

01:07:00.834 --> 01:07:02.304
- Yeah, yeah.

01:07:02.304 --> 01:07:04.387
- She means a lot to you.

01:07:06.529 --> 01:07:10.388
- Yeah I mean, everyone
cares about her, right?

01:07:10.388 --> 01:07:12.368
- Yeah, but like you'd be concerned

01:07:12.368 --> 01:07:15.034
if something happened to her.

01:07:15.034 --> 01:07:18.548
(soft somber music)

01:07:18.548 --> 01:07:20.512
- What are you tryin' to say?

01:07:20.512 --> 01:07:21.937
- I'm just saying like it's nice.

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:24.354
Like I can tell you'd be very

01:07:26.378 --> 01:07:29.968
concerned if something happened to her.

01:07:29.968 --> 01:07:31.232
- We don't know, what?

01:07:31.232 --> 01:07:32.065
- Right?

01:07:32.065 --> 01:07:32.999
- Yeah I mean, yeah.

01:07:32.999 --> 01:07:37.465
Yeah, I'd be concerned if
anything happened to her.

01:07:37.465 --> 01:07:40.105
Okay, I'm gonna go inside.

01:07:40.105 --> 01:07:41.772
- Cool.
- Yeah, cool.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.543
- Hey, my man.
- No.

01:07:47.571 --> 01:07:48.571
- All right.

01:07:50.759 --> 01:07:52.968
(door squeaking and slamming)

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:54.431
- Everything okay?

01:07:54.431 --> 01:07:56.467
- [Tyler] Yeah, everything's
fucking fantastic, Winston.

01:07:56.467 --> 01:07:59.134
(phone ringing)

01:08:02.693 --> 01:08:03.526
- Hello?

01:08:03.526 --> 01:08:05.491
- [Brent] Hey LA, did
you find your friend?

01:08:05.491 --> 01:08:06.324
- Not yet.

01:08:06.324 --> 01:08:07.401
How's it goin'?

01:08:07.401 --> 01:08:08.538
- [Brent] Hey, I got a little more

01:08:08.538 --> 01:08:10.600
bad news for you, unfortunately.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.743
We talked to Tony.

01:08:11.743 --> 01:08:13.127
He's willing to come by,

01:08:13.127 --> 01:08:15.913
but he's way a way at his
daughter's soccer game

01:08:15.913 --> 01:08:19.924
out El Centro, so he's not gonna
be done for a couple hours.

01:08:19.924 --> 01:08:21.277
- Fuck.

01:08:21.277 --> 01:08:23.277
Isn't there anyone else?

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.283
- [Brent] There's really
nothin' else for it,

01:08:26.283 --> 01:08:27.734
but the sheriff.

01:08:27.734 --> 01:08:29.066
If you want, we can go ahead

01:08:29.066 --> 01:08:30.908
and we can call him on your behalf.

01:08:30.908 --> 01:08:32.332
We can let him know you're a good guy,

01:08:32.332 --> 01:08:33.661
we'd mention we spoke to you

01:08:33.661 --> 01:08:36.697
and that whatever happened, happened.

01:08:36.697 --> 01:08:38.265
You know, it's not totally your fault.

01:08:38.265 --> 01:08:39.716
And it's way better than you calling

01:08:39.716 --> 01:08:41.734
and having him put an
APB on a missing person.

01:08:41.734 --> 01:08:42.567
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:08:42.567 --> 01:08:44.363
- [Chip] Yeah, we'd do that for ya.

01:08:44.363 --> 01:08:45.533
- Yeah, I get it.

01:08:45.533 --> 01:08:47.292
- [Brent] All right,
so think long and hard

01:08:47.292 --> 01:08:49.139
and figure out if that's
somethin' you wanna do.

01:08:49.139 --> 01:08:49.971
It's a big deal.

01:08:49.971 --> 01:08:52.292
Let us know.
- Yeah.

01:08:52.292 --> 01:08:53.475
- Will do.

01:08:53.475 --> 01:08:54.308
- [Brent] All right, man.

01:08:54.308 --> 01:08:55.140
We're gonna wrap this up over here

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:55.974
and as soon as we're done with this,

01:08:55.974 --> 01:08:57.657
we're gonna race over
there, help you out, buddy.

01:08:57.657 --> 01:08:58.625
All right, LA?

01:08:58.625 --> 01:08:59.827
We're gonna get you outta this.

01:08:59.827 --> 01:09:01.160
- [Chip] Getcha.

01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:04.426
- Fuck.

01:09:04.426 --> 01:09:05.259
Fuck.

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:08.321
- Look, her bags are still here.

01:09:08.321 --> 01:09:09.966
- That's not a good sign.
- Right?

01:09:09.966 --> 01:09:12.663
- Why wouldn't she have taken her bags?

01:09:12.663 --> 01:09:13.600
- Maybe she's comin' back, you know?

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.091
Maybe she just went into town

01:09:15.091 --> 01:09:17.015
to grab a bite to eat or somethin'.

01:09:17.015 --> 01:09:18.765
- It's 10 miles away.

01:09:19.783 --> 01:09:20.688
I don't think.

01:09:20.688 --> 01:09:21.716
She hates walking.

01:09:21.716 --> 01:09:24.366
- Look, I don't know where she is, okay?

01:09:24.366 --> 01:09:26.332
We can speculate all we want.

01:09:26.332 --> 01:09:28.054
But she's gonna turn up, all right?

01:09:28.054 --> 01:09:29.745
Everything's gonna be better

01:09:29.745 --> 01:09:33.412
and then we'll look back
on this day and laugh.

01:09:33.412 --> 01:09:35.727
- I mean, I wish I had your positivity.

01:09:35.727 --> 01:09:37.305
I really appreciate it.

01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:39.965
I hope that you're right.

01:09:39.965 --> 01:09:40.993
What're you doing?

01:09:40.993 --> 01:09:42.586
What's going on?

01:09:42.586 --> 01:09:45.419
(water splashing)

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:47.540
What is that?

01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:50.872
(soft foreboding music)

01:09:54.939 --> 01:09:57.571
We absolutely have to call the cops.

01:09:57.571 --> 01:09:58.770
I'm not sure why we're waiting.

01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:00.250
We need help right now.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:01.740
We can't call the cops.

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:03.355
I'm on court-ordered rehab

01:10:03.355 --> 01:10:05.104
and we were doin' drugs last night.

01:10:05.104 --> 01:10:06.532
- I'm sorry, I just think it's strange

01:10:06.532 --> 01:10:07.728
that the last person who was with her

01:10:07.728 --> 01:10:09.406
doesn't wanna call the police.

01:10:09.406 --> 01:10:11.243
- Okay, well the guy who
tried to kill himself over her

01:10:11.243 --> 01:10:12.076
would probably be a little upset.

01:10:12.076 --> 01:10:13.357
- All right.
- The fuck, dude?

01:10:13.357 --> 01:10:14.190
- It's not what you think.

01:10:14.190 --> 01:10:18.109
I told her so that he
wouldn't hook up with Abby.

01:10:18.109 --> 01:10:19.214
- Cool, man.

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:20.974
Cool and that worked.

01:10:20.974 --> 01:10:23.101
Abby wasn't even supposed
to fucking be here, Winston.

01:10:23.101 --> 01:10:24.973
This whole fuckin' trip sucks.

01:10:24.973 --> 01:10:26.391
It's all about you draggin' people along

01:10:26.391 --> 01:10:27.498
for your fuckin' birthday.

01:10:27.498 --> 01:10:28.559
The whole thing fuckin' sucks.

01:10:28.559 --> 01:10:29.392
- You're absolutely right.

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:31.113
It's my fault for my
have a birthday party.

01:10:31.113 --> 01:10:31.952
I'm the asshole.

01:10:31.952 --> 01:10:33.954
I didn't have anything
to do with Abby missing.

01:10:33.954 --> 01:10:34.787
I'm the bad guy, I'm the bad guy.

01:10:34.787 --> 01:10:36.590
- [Tyler] You're making it all
about you, dude.

01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:37.756
- No.
- It's fucking not.

01:10:37.756 --> 01:10:38.589
- Stop.

01:10:38.589 --> 01:10:39.923
It's not his fault, okay?

01:10:39.923 --> 01:10:41.040
He was trying to help.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.287
He's trying to be helpful.

01:10:42.287 --> 01:10:43.551
- Yeah and for the record, I think

01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:47.027
it's probably some sort of
drug-coyote-cartel situation.

01:10:47.027 --> 01:10:47.860
- Oh, come on.

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:48.693
This is a quiet town.

01:10:48.693 --> 01:10:50.630
It's mostly senior
citizens paintin' ceramics.

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:51.463
- Seriously, dude.

01:10:51.463 --> 01:10:53.469
Why are you so convinced
that somebody killed Abby?

01:10:53.469 --> 01:10:55.532
Like this is getting fucking ridiculous.

01:10:55.532 --> 01:10:56.365
- [Tyler] Hey, you guys.

01:10:56.365 --> 01:10:57.615
The gun's gone.

01:11:03.083 --> 01:11:04.741
- [Winston] Oh good, great.

01:11:04.741 --> 01:11:06.161
- [Tyler] Where's the gun, Nate?

01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:08.174
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off, dude.

01:11:08.174 --> 01:11:09.867
- [Nate] What am I gonna do, steal a gun?

01:11:09.867 --> 01:11:11.924
- Yeah, I think you're gonna steal a gun.

01:11:11.924 --> 01:11:15.327
(group chattering)

01:11:15.327 --> 01:11:17.744
I don't know, I'm not a violent person.

01:11:17.744 --> 01:11:19.994
Your brother is a criminal.

01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:23.518
I don't have a fucking criminal record.

01:11:23.518 --> 01:11:25.092
This guy's been to prison more times

01:11:25.092 --> 01:11:26.641
than fuckin' (drowned out
by chattering) actually

01:11:26.641 --> 01:11:27.925
if you fuckin' think about it.

01:11:27.925 --> 01:11:30.559
(phone ringing)
- Fucking relax.

01:11:30.559 --> 01:11:32.208
(muffled chattering)

01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:34.161
- [Tyler] I'm talking
about your lifestyle.

01:11:34.161 --> 01:11:36.172
- [Joe] I'm sorry your friend lied to me.

01:11:36.172 --> 01:11:37.005
- It's Doug.

01:11:37.005 --> 01:11:37.922
Guys, guys.

01:11:40.702 --> 01:11:41.535
Hello?

01:11:41.535 --> 01:11:42.785
- [Doug] Winston, my boy.

01:11:42.785 --> 01:11:44.371
How is everything goin' there?

01:11:44.371 --> 01:11:45.964
- [Winston] Everything's fine here, Doug.

01:11:45.964 --> 01:11:49.281
- [Doug] No issues with the
security system or the hot tub?

01:11:49.281 --> 01:11:51.084
- Nope, shipshape.

01:11:51.084 --> 01:11:54.588
- [Doug] Say, I haven't heard
from Joe since last night.

01:11:54.588 --> 01:11:55.715
Have you?

01:11:55.715 --> 01:11:57.436
- Can't say that I have.

01:11:57.436 --> 01:12:00.215
- [Doug] He hasn't been
there since last night.

01:12:00.215 --> 01:12:01.048
- Nope.

01:12:02.012 --> 01:12:03.262
- [Doug] I see.

01:12:05.274 --> 01:12:07.475
You sure everything's all right?

01:12:07.475 --> 01:12:08.361
- Yup.

01:12:08.361 --> 01:12:09.572
- [Doug] Well if you see him,

01:12:09.572 --> 01:12:12.378
you tell him to call
me as soon as possible.

01:12:12.378 --> 01:12:13.461
- You got it.

01:12:16.877 --> 01:12:19.314
Doug knows somethin's wrong.

01:12:19.314 --> 01:12:21.521
If anyone took the gun and if
you have anything else to say,

01:12:21.521 --> 01:12:22.771
now's the time.

01:12:27.252 --> 01:12:29.802
Okay, everyone go get their luggage.

01:12:29.802 --> 01:12:32.575
We're gonna see who has the gun.

01:12:32.575 --> 01:12:35.411
We're gonna get to the
bottom of this right now.

01:12:35.411 --> 01:12:37.125
Somebody's got the gun.

01:12:37.125 --> 01:12:38.802
We're gonna go around, we're
gonna open our suitcases

01:12:38.802 --> 01:12:41.249
and we're gonna find out who's
got somethin' to hide, okay?

01:12:41.249 --> 01:12:42.416
I'll go first.

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:46.616
Okay, all right.

01:12:46.616 --> 01:12:47.455
See?

01:12:47.455 --> 01:12:48.795
Nothin'.

01:12:48.795 --> 01:12:50.878
Jules, she's got nothin'.

01:12:54.705 --> 01:12:56.239
Okay, all right.

01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:57.249
Tyler.

01:12:57.249 --> 01:13:01.999
- Yeah I mean, pretty much
the standard Tyler experience.

01:13:02.938 --> 01:13:05.922
Some antidepressants for ya,

01:13:05.922 --> 01:13:08.005
my journal, some clothes.

01:13:08.993 --> 01:13:11.142
- Is this a picture of you
and Abby from our wedding?

01:13:11.142 --> 01:13:12.483
- That's mine.

01:13:12.483 --> 01:13:14.389
- You ripped us out.

01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:17.995
- That's the only picture
I have with her, and yeah.

01:13:17.995 --> 01:13:20.037
- That's so weird.
- It's not weird.

01:13:20.037 --> 01:13:23.075
I think everyone knows I kinda
have feelings for her, okay?

01:13:23.075 --> 01:13:26.095
- [Winston] All right okay, Nate.

01:13:26.095 --> 01:13:28.831
- This is screwed, you know?

01:13:28.831 --> 01:13:30.720
You guys know I didn't do anything.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:31.553
- [Julia] Just do it or I'll do it.

01:13:31.553 --> 01:13:32.619
- I'm doing it.

01:13:32.619 --> 01:13:33.934
I got the Molly from last night.

01:13:33.934 --> 01:13:34.829
- [Tyler] Very nice.

01:13:34.829 --> 01:13:36.321
- Some weed.
- Good.

01:13:36.321 --> 01:13:37.247
- Some other stuff.
- Yeah.

01:13:37.247 --> 01:13:38.080
- [Nate] Some cocaine.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.348
- It's nice to see that
the court-mandated rehab

01:13:40.348 --> 01:13:41.313
is going so well for someone.

01:13:41.313 --> 01:13:42.146
- You know what?

01:13:42.146 --> 01:13:43.555
It's a party and I wanna let loose, okay?

01:13:43.555 --> 01:13:44.388
- Good, very good.

01:13:44.388 --> 01:13:45.357
- [Winston] All right, it doesn't matter.

01:13:45.357 --> 01:13:46.539
- [Tyler] The noble drug dealer.

01:13:46.539 --> 01:13:48.235
- All right, Joe.
- It's the classic.

01:13:48.235 --> 01:13:49.573
- No luggage.

01:13:49.573 --> 01:13:51.325
- Yeah, I'll just be transparent here.

01:13:51.325 --> 01:13:54.456
You know, I just got kinda
some basic stuff in here.

01:13:54.456 --> 01:13:56.443
There's a phone, you know?

01:13:56.443 --> 01:13:57.472
I got a baseball card I
laminate for good luck.

01:13:57.472 --> 01:13:59.488
- That's fine.
- I got my wallet.

01:13:59.488 --> 01:14:00.378
Guys, I'm clean.

01:14:00.378 --> 01:14:02.002
You guys are my friends. That's a penny.

01:14:02.002 --> 01:14:04.039
- Okay thanks, Joe.

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:05.724
Well that leaves you, Margot.

01:14:05.724 --> 01:14:06.822
- You can't be serious.

01:14:06.822 --> 01:14:07.828
- I'm dead serious.

01:14:07.828 --> 01:14:09.688
We all know you been hidin' in that room.

01:14:09.688 --> 01:14:10.916
- Seriously, dude?
- You're doing God-knows-what.

01:14:10.916 --> 01:14:11.960
You're the most suspicious one here.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:12.793
- Doing God-knows-what.

01:14:12.793 --> 01:14:14.807
What are you doing screaming
outside at four in the morning?

01:14:14.807 --> 01:14:15.640
- Oh, come on.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:16.947
Open the suitcase like we all just did

01:14:16.947 --> 01:14:17.780
if you have nothing to hide.

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:18.613
- Fine, fine.

01:14:18.613 --> 01:14:19.446
Do you want me to open the suitcase?

01:14:19.446 --> 01:14:20.279
- [Winston] Yes.

01:14:20.279 --> 01:14:21.112
- I'm gonna open the suitcase for ya.

01:14:21.112 --> 01:14:21.945
Here you go.

01:14:21.945 --> 01:14:23.717
Oh, happy fuckin' day.

01:14:23.717 --> 01:14:24.566
- [Joe] Holy shit.

01:14:24.566 --> 01:14:25.852
- I sell panties.

01:14:25.852 --> 01:14:28.019
Are you fuckin' happy now?

01:14:29.688 --> 01:14:32.241
Look, I see you judging me, okay?

01:14:32.241 --> 01:14:33.215
I lost my fucking job.

01:14:33.215 --> 01:14:34.838
I had to sell my car to make rent.

01:14:34.838 --> 01:14:37.028
That ran out pretty quick.

01:14:37.028 --> 01:14:39.250
So I ran into this girl who
said she did this kinda shit

01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:41.880
and it seems easy enough.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.464
Look if you don't believe me, ask Tyler.

01:14:43.464 --> 01:14:44.297
He knew.

01:14:44.297 --> 01:14:45.774
- [Winston] What?

01:14:45.774 --> 01:14:46.774
- Well, yes.

01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:51.302
She asked me not to tell anyone.

01:14:51.302 --> 01:14:52.850
It's a very nuanced and complex area

01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:55.350
of feminism that. I knew, yeah.

01:14:56.246 --> 01:14:58.037
- So what, you do porn?

01:14:58.037 --> 01:14:59.213
- No, I'm not doing porn.

01:14:59.213 --> 01:15:01.333
I sell used panties.

01:15:01.333 --> 01:15:03.132
Look, one pair can get me like 50 bucks.

01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:05.870
If I take a picture,
I can get one to $200.

01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:08.155
- That's the story that
you want us to believe?

01:15:08.155 --> 01:15:09.488
- [Margot] Look.

01:15:11.191 --> 01:15:12.121
Exactly.

01:15:12.121 --> 01:15:15.489
- Okay, so I guess this
guy paid for your Uber.

01:15:15.489 --> 01:15:18.442
- So people just pay you for panties?

01:15:18.442 --> 01:15:19.279
- Yeah.

01:15:19.279 --> 01:15:21.610
I can sell panties, socks.

01:15:21.610 --> 01:15:25.081
God, if I write a guy's name on my arm,

01:15:25.081 --> 01:15:27.077
couple hundred at least.

01:15:27.077 --> 01:15:28.233
Okay, so if we're gonna
go through my phone,

01:15:28.233 --> 01:15:29.412
I get to go through all of yours.

01:15:29.412 --> 01:15:30.807
Let's start with you, Winston.

01:15:30.807 --> 01:15:32.886
Wanna show me your phone?

01:15:32.886 --> 01:15:34.093
- That's fine, I don't give a shit.

01:15:34.093 --> 01:15:35.054
I don't have anything to hide.

01:15:35.054 --> 01:15:35.887
- Perfect.

01:15:39.956 --> 01:15:41.956
"To Tyler," and I quote.

01:15:43.119 --> 01:15:44.522
"Yeah, I know Nate's a douchebag,

01:15:44.522 --> 01:15:46.598
"but just bear with me for the night."

01:15:46.598 --> 01:15:47.431
Wow.

01:15:47.431 --> 01:15:48.264
- [Nate] I'm a douche?

01:15:48.264 --> 01:15:49.985
- I'm just tellin' him
what he wants to hear.

01:15:49.985 --> 01:15:51.489
- Oh, cool.

01:15:51.489 --> 01:15:52.493
- No, I didn't mean.

01:15:52.493 --> 01:15:53.572
- No, no, thank you.

01:15:53.572 --> 01:15:54.743
I appreciate that.

01:15:54.743 --> 01:15:57.331
- [Margot] Whatever, on to the next.

01:15:57.331 --> 01:15:58.164
Julia?

01:16:01.048 --> 01:16:02.585
- This is so dumb.

01:16:02.585 --> 01:16:03.418
Okay?

01:16:03.418 --> 01:16:04.657
Nothing to hide.

01:16:04.657 --> 01:16:06.074
- Lemme see that.

01:16:07.287 --> 01:16:09.317
That's not nothing, Julia.

01:16:09.317 --> 01:16:11.884
You have about 10 missed calls from Mitch

01:16:11.884 --> 01:16:13.433
and several text messages too.

01:16:13.433 --> 01:16:14.651
What the fuck is that?

01:16:14.651 --> 01:16:15.702
- Who cares?

01:16:15.702 --> 01:16:16.705
- Who cares?

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:18.788
Oh, you have a voicemail also.

01:16:18.788 --> 01:16:20.815
Let's see what that's about.

01:16:20.815 --> 01:16:22.909
- [Mitch] Seriously fuck you, Julia.

01:16:22.909 --> 01:16:24.535
This is the same fuckin' bullshit

01:16:24.535 --> 01:16:26.209
every time you two hang out.

01:16:26.209 --> 01:16:27.635
She's not answering my calls.

01:16:27.635 --> 01:16:28.781
She won't text me back.

01:16:28.781 --> 01:16:30.069
I check your fucking Instagram

01:16:30.069 --> 01:16:31.339
and there's some picture with her

01:16:31.339 --> 01:16:34.118
with some random guy in a fucking hot tub.

01:16:34.118 --> 01:16:36.592
Tell Abby to call me right fucking now.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:37.938
Fuckin' bitch.

01:16:37.938 --> 01:16:39.101
- [Tyler] I could play that again

01:16:39.101 --> 01:16:40.286
if anyone wants to hear it again.

01:16:40.286 --> 01:16:41.119
- [Margot] Yeah.

01:16:41.119 --> 01:16:43.183
- What picture is he talkin' about, hun?

01:16:43.183 --> 01:16:45.467
- (chuckles) Okay, this is the picture

01:16:45.467 --> 01:16:46.305
that he is talking about.

01:16:46.305 --> 01:16:47.844
This is the one that she posted.

01:16:47.844 --> 01:16:50.838
Her engaged best friend in a hot tub

01:16:50.838 --> 01:16:52.908
with her drug dealing brother

01:16:52.908 --> 01:16:56.067
with the rest of the gang
conveniently cropped out.

01:16:56.067 --> 01:16:57.012
Maybe that's the picture
that he's talkin' about.

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:57.845
- Okay Tyler, yes.

01:16:57.845 --> 01:17:00.209
Yes, yes, I posted the picture, okay?

01:17:00.209 --> 01:17:02.742
Yes, I cropped everyone else out.

01:17:02.742 --> 01:17:04.614
I was trying to break them up

01:17:04.614 --> 01:17:06.444
and I was trying to set you guys up.

01:17:06.444 --> 01:17:07.702
She was in a horrible relationship.

01:17:07.702 --> 01:17:09.778
I was just helping her, okay?

01:17:09.778 --> 01:17:11.170
That doesn't prove anything.

01:17:11.170 --> 01:17:13.925
Gimme my fucking phone back.

01:17:13.925 --> 01:17:16.484
- You guys are welcome to my phone.

01:17:16.484 --> 01:17:17.536
- Yeah, here.

01:17:17.536 --> 01:17:18.919
You assholes can look at my phone.

01:17:18.919 --> 01:17:20.821
I don't give a shit.

01:17:20.821 --> 01:17:23.068
- [Winston] All right
Joe, I guess your phone.

01:17:23.068 --> 01:17:24.472
- You guys don't need to see my phone.

01:17:24.472 --> 01:17:27.700
I mean I just came over to help out

01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:29.420
and we ended up just hangin' out,

01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:32.577
so there's no reason to see my phone.

01:17:32.577 --> 01:17:33.710
- Here, buddy.

01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:35.807
I'll just take a little peek at it.

01:17:35.807 --> 01:17:36.640
- Okay.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.814
Yeah sure, of course.

01:17:37.814 --> 01:17:38.724
- [Margot] Thank you, babe.

01:17:38.724 --> 01:17:40.141
- No, no problem.

01:17:43.305 --> 01:17:46.805
- It's just a bunch of texts from his dad.

01:17:50.352 --> 01:17:52.185
- "Guests are having a
problem with the hot tub.

01:17:52.185 --> 01:17:54.768
"Can you go over and check it?"

01:17:56.041 --> 01:17:57.458
Is Doug your dad?

01:17:59.183 --> 01:18:00.016
- No.

01:18:01.664 --> 01:18:03.164
Doug's not my dad.

01:18:05.710 --> 01:18:08.989
Okay, he's my dad technically.

01:18:08.989 --> 01:18:10.484
But when he goes outta town,

01:18:10.484 --> 01:18:12.170
I don't even live inside
the house anymore.

01:18:12.170 --> 01:18:13.683
He makes me go and live out in a tent

01:18:13.683 --> 01:18:16.063
and just kinda act as the
groundskeeper and help out.

01:18:16.063 --> 01:18:18.591
And normally that is all I would do,

01:18:18.591 --> 01:18:21.122
I would just come in and
I would fix the hot tub.

01:18:21.122 --> 01:18:23.973
But somethin' happened and
you guys were nice to me.

01:18:23.973 --> 01:18:25.139
Even the ones of you who didn't like me,

01:18:25.139 --> 01:18:27.782
at least you put up with me
and I've never had that before.

01:18:27.782 --> 01:18:29.585
I have no friends.

01:18:29.585 --> 01:18:30.721
I've never had any friends.

01:18:30.721 --> 01:18:33.484
There's people here are like 70 years old.

01:18:33.484 --> 01:18:35.438
And all of a sudden I'm
having fun with you guys

01:18:35.438 --> 01:18:39.546
and I don't know, it just got
easier and easier to pretend

01:18:39.546 --> 01:18:42.075
that I was you know, just one of you

01:18:42.075 --> 01:18:43.893
and we're all hanging out.

01:18:43.893 --> 01:18:45.712
And I'm sorry that I did it.

01:18:45.712 --> 01:18:47.716
I feel bad for lying, I really do.

01:18:47.716 --> 01:18:52.716
But I don't feel bad for
hanging out because honestly,

01:18:52.985 --> 01:18:54.865
I don't think I've had this
much fun in my life ever

01:18:54.865 --> 01:18:57.772
and it feels crazy that
we've known each other

01:18:57.772 --> 01:18:59.720
for less than a couple days

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.332
and I don't think I have any friends

01:19:01.332 --> 01:19:03.988
that are better than you guys.

01:19:03.988 --> 01:19:06.170
- So you been lying to us this whole time.

01:19:06.170 --> 01:19:08.001
- Basically, yes.

01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:09.883
- Okay, you know what?

01:19:09.883 --> 01:19:11.808
You can tell it to the
Community Task Force.

01:19:11.808 --> 01:19:12.641
- Community Task Force?

01:19:12.641 --> 01:19:14.271
What are you talking about?

01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:15.594
- The Neighborhood Watch guys.

01:19:15.594 --> 01:19:17.243
- What are you talking about?

01:19:17.243 --> 01:19:18.875
There's no Community Task Force.

01:19:18.875 --> 01:19:21.792
- Oh yeah, then who are these guys?

01:19:22.966 --> 01:19:24.070
- These guys?

01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.903
No, they're locals.

01:19:24.903 --> 01:19:26.555
They dress up like cops to scare you

01:19:26.555 --> 01:19:27.923
when you come into town.

01:19:27.923 --> 01:19:30.375
They're tryin' to keep you
from staying here anymore.

01:19:30.375 --> 01:19:32.958
- The phone line's dead.
- What?

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.144
- [Joe] Smart scorpions out here

01:19:36.144 --> 01:19:37.643
that are just snip, snippin'.

01:19:37.643 --> 01:19:39.851
- That's kinda weird.
- Yeah, I'm sure it's fine.

01:19:39.851 --> 01:19:43.384
- What is this?
- It's like a phone line.

01:19:43.384 --> 01:19:44.353
- [Joe] Accidents happen.

01:19:44.353 --> 01:19:45.186
- Accidents?

01:19:45.186 --> 01:19:47.113
This is a clean cut.

01:19:47.113 --> 01:19:49.874
That's some shady business.

01:19:49.874 --> 01:19:51.554
Oh my gosh, what is this?

01:19:51.554 --> 01:19:53.731
This is an aux cable, dude.

01:19:53.731 --> 01:19:55.197
This is for like...

01:19:55.197 --> 01:19:57.697
Hey Joe, what is this aux for?

01:19:59.936 --> 01:20:00.769
Joe?

01:20:02.829 --> 01:20:04.480
Joe.

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.313
- Honestly Julia, I think
you're bored and you're sad.

01:20:05.313 --> 01:20:07.303
- [Margot] So really I
have nothin' to hide.

01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:09.107
- [Julia] Are you serious?

01:20:09.107 --> 01:20:10.702
I'm bored and sad?
- Yeah.

01:20:10.702 --> 01:20:11.840
- [Julia] My mediocre life?

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.129
- Hey, guys.

01:20:13.129 --> 01:20:14.076
Guys.

01:20:14.076 --> 01:20:15.338
Hey, guys.

01:20:15.338 --> 01:20:17.129
Someone cut the phone line outside.

01:20:17.129 --> 01:20:17.962
- What?

01:20:17.962 --> 01:20:20.379
- Yeah and Joe's disappeared.

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:22.692
Yeah, so check it out.

01:20:22.692 --> 01:20:24.577
I come out here.

01:20:24.577 --> 01:20:26.163
Phone line, cut.

01:20:26.163 --> 01:20:26.996
Look at this.

01:20:26.996 --> 01:20:28.786
A separate cord kinda coming out.

01:20:28.786 --> 01:20:30.662
I point that out to Joe and he takes off.

01:20:30.662 --> 01:20:31.495
- Well where is he?

01:20:31.495 --> 01:20:32.328
- I don't know, man.

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:33.608
I can't find him.

01:20:33.608 --> 01:20:35.309
I'm freakin' out, man.

01:20:35.309 --> 01:20:36.234
You know?

01:20:36.234 --> 01:20:38.688
Something is not right.

01:20:38.688 --> 01:20:39.660
- We should've just called the cops

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:42.827
when I said I wanted to call the cops.

01:20:47.452 --> 01:20:50.285
- [Tyler] Hey, I found Joe's tent.

01:20:51.583 --> 01:20:53.000
You see it?
- Yup.

01:20:54.485 --> 01:20:55.820
We should go check it out.

01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:59.294
- What's happening?
- We found Joe's tent.

01:20:59.294 --> 01:21:00.127
Why don't we go look?

01:21:00.127 --> 01:21:00.960
You guys stay here.

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.007
- [Julia] You're not going out there.

01:21:02.007 --> 01:21:03.469
- We gotta check it out.

01:21:03.469 --> 01:21:04.302
It'll be fine.

01:21:04.302 --> 01:21:05.564
I'll be right back.

01:21:05.564 --> 01:21:07.636
I'll be fine, all right?
- Oh my god.

01:21:07.636 --> 01:21:10.553
- [Margot] I don't need to be here.

01:21:12.621 --> 01:21:14.313
Yup, you know, I shouldn't have come.

01:21:14.313 --> 01:21:16.489
Definitely should not have come.

01:21:16.489 --> 01:21:18.572
- [Nate] They'll be fine.

01:21:23.035 --> 01:21:26.677
- Are you getting anything?
- Nothing.

01:21:26.677 --> 01:21:28.260
- This is so weird.

01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:33.512
Oh my god.

01:21:35.421 --> 01:21:36.254
Oh my god.

01:21:37.999 --> 01:21:38.832
Holy shit.

01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:41.896
Oh my gosh.

01:21:43.337 --> 01:21:44.170
Holy shit.

01:21:45.704 --> 01:21:49.172
(chuckles) You son of a bitch.

01:21:49.172 --> 01:21:51.505
- [Julia] What're you doing?

01:21:53.627 --> 01:21:55.848
- This is a camera.

01:21:55.848 --> 01:21:57.029
This whole place has cameras.

01:21:57.029 --> 01:21:59.378
He's been watching this whole thing.

01:21:59.378 --> 01:22:00.211
- What?

01:22:03.341 --> 01:22:05.091
- [Winston] Joe, Joe.

01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:10.883
(soft foreboding music)

01:22:21.654 --> 01:22:23.321
- [Tyler] Holy shit.

01:22:35.129 --> 01:22:36.793
- Guys, guys.
- Hey.

01:22:36.793 --> 01:22:38.737
- Look what we found in Joe's tent.

01:22:38.737 --> 01:22:39.695
- What is that, a gun?
- Fuckin' gun.

01:22:39.695 --> 01:22:41.712
- [Winston] Yeah, we
gotta call the cops now.

01:22:41.712 --> 01:22:42.810
- Look what I found.

01:22:42.810 --> 01:22:43.643
- So what?

01:22:43.643 --> 01:22:44.476
You don't understand.

01:22:44.476 --> 01:22:45.757
The gun was in Joe's tent.

01:22:45.757 --> 01:22:46.672
End of story.

01:22:46.672 --> 01:22:47.572
We gotta call the cops.

01:22:47.572 --> 01:22:48.405
- Okay, man.

01:22:48.405 --> 01:22:50.248
But look, this is a camera, right?

01:22:50.248 --> 01:22:51.199
I found a bunch of 'em.

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:52.408
And this one was pointed at the pool

01:22:52.408 --> 01:22:53.691
where I found Abby's phone.

01:22:53.691 --> 01:22:55.686
So if we can find the tape,

01:22:55.686 --> 01:22:57.398
we can find out what happened to Abby.

01:22:57.398 --> 01:22:58.581
- Well we've been all
over the house all day.

01:22:58.581 --> 01:22:59.631
Where would that be?

01:22:59.631 --> 01:23:02.837
- [Nate] Is there any
room we haven't looked in?

01:23:02.837 --> 01:23:04.381
- Here it is, but it's locked.

01:23:04.381 --> 01:23:05.601
Doug took the key.

01:23:05.601 --> 01:23:08.934
(soft foreboding music)

01:23:09.786 --> 01:23:11.078
- You know what?

01:23:11.078 --> 01:23:12.287
Fuck this.

01:23:12.287 --> 01:23:14.387
- [Julia] Nate, what're you doing?

01:23:14.387 --> 01:23:16.165
(doorknob bashing)
- Jesus Christ.

01:23:16.165 --> 01:23:16.998
- Open.

01:23:19.831 --> 01:23:20.831
- Holy shit.

01:23:23.628 --> 01:23:25.378
What the actual fuck?

01:23:26.525 --> 01:23:27.576
- Who's that?
- Look at this.

01:23:27.576 --> 01:23:31.743
He's got records of other
people that stayed here.

01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:35.579
This one's still recording, look.

01:23:35.579 --> 01:23:38.288
Hold on, let's see if we can play it.

01:23:38.288 --> 01:23:39.301
- [Winston] Whoa.

01:23:39.301 --> 01:23:40.714
- So here's Nate finding the footage.

01:23:40.714 --> 01:23:43.797
Lemme see if I can rewind this thing.

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.400
Oh.
- Okay, in my fucking room?

01:23:50.788 --> 01:23:53.121
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Oh god.

01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:55.811
- He has a camera in the bathroom?

01:23:55.811 --> 01:23:59.422
- That's disgusting.
- What does he want that for?

01:23:59.422 --> 01:24:01.911
- [Winston] There's Joe with the gun.

01:24:01.911 --> 01:24:03.547
- I fuckin' knew it.
- Oh, man.

01:24:03.547 --> 01:24:06.797
- There's something off about him, man.

01:24:08.816 --> 01:24:10.233
And there's Abby.

01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:15.363
Winston, what?

01:24:15.363 --> 01:24:16.707
You said that you didn't see her.

01:24:16.707 --> 01:24:17.640
- I didn't.

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.631
- Well you did though.

01:24:19.631 --> 01:24:20.886
- I fucking knew it.
- What?

01:24:20.886 --> 01:24:22.127
- I knew I heard you screaming out there

01:24:22.127 --> 01:24:24.145
at four in the fucking morning, dude.

01:24:24.145 --> 01:24:25.857
Denying it this entire fucking time!

01:24:25.857 --> 01:24:27.932
- Hang on, I'm obviously
blacked out there.

01:24:27.932 --> 01:24:28.977
That doesn't mean anything.

01:24:28.977 --> 01:24:30.807
- What, she wasn't invited to the party

01:24:30.807 --> 01:24:31.977
and ruin your little birthday bash?

01:24:31.977 --> 01:24:32.810
Is that what you do?

01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:33.937
- Are you kidding me right now?

01:24:33.937 --> 01:24:34.795
- I wouldn't fuckin' do anything.

01:24:34.795 --> 01:24:35.813
Jules, tell them.

01:24:35.813 --> 01:24:36.646
- Hey, man.

01:24:36.646 --> 01:24:37.479
What're you doing?
- I don't know what to say.

01:24:37.479 --> 01:24:38.727
- What, you of all people,

01:24:38.727 --> 01:24:40.074
why are you out there?

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:40.907
- [Winston] Why?

01:24:40.907 --> 01:24:41.740
I blacked out.

01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:42.826
I wouldn't hurt Abby.
- You of all people.

01:24:42.826 --> 01:24:44.033
I stood up for you!

01:24:44.033 --> 01:24:45.741
- Okay, all right.
- Just calm down.

01:24:45.741 --> 01:24:46.997
- [Margot] Who calls the cop when,

01:24:46.997 --> 01:24:48.175
you try and turn this shit on me?

01:24:48.175 --> 01:24:49.008
No, dude.

01:24:49.008 --> 01:24:50.812
- Are you all fucking crazy right now?

01:24:50.812 --> 01:24:51.990
I didn't do anything.

01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.996
- [Nate] Are you serious right now?

01:24:52.996 --> 01:24:54.741
- Are you?
- Yeah.

01:24:54.741 --> 01:24:55.574
- Get the fuck away from me, Nate.

01:24:55.574 --> 01:24:56.407
- [Nate] Or what, motherfucker?

01:24:56.407 --> 01:24:57.890
- She got in the car.

01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:59.101
- Bullshit.
- Stop.

01:24:59.101 --> 01:24:59.934
- [Winston] Get the fuck away from me.

01:24:59.934 --> 01:25:01.253
- Or what?
- Calm down.

01:25:01.253 --> 01:25:02.811
- Or what, motherfucker?

01:25:02.811 --> 01:25:03.644
(grunts) Goddammit!

01:25:03.644 --> 01:25:05.148
- The fuck just happened?
- [Automated Voice] Power failure.

01:25:05.148 --> 01:25:07.085
- Power's out.
- You fucking hit Nate.

01:25:07.085 --> 01:25:08.661
- [Nate] You fuckin' hit me, man!

01:25:08.661 --> 01:25:09.494
- [Winston] I'm sorry.

01:25:09.494 --> 01:25:10.835
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

01:25:10.835 --> 01:25:12.841
- [Nate] (winces) Jesus Christ!

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:15.407
- [Automated Voice] Power failure.
- Oh my god!

01:25:15.407 --> 01:25:16.363
- [Tyler] What's going on?

01:25:16.363 --> 01:25:18.124
- [Margot] Winston fucking attacked Nate.

01:25:18.124 --> 01:25:19.241
- Fucking hit me right in the head, dude.

01:25:19.241 --> 01:25:21.170
- (gasps) Oh my god.
- Oh my god.

01:25:21.170 --> 01:25:22.172
- (winces) Fuck.

01:25:22.172 --> 01:25:23.779
- [Julia] I think he's
really hurt, you guys.

01:25:23.779 --> 01:25:24.747
- Oh fuck.

01:25:24.747 --> 01:25:26.344
- [Julia] Isn't there any light?

01:25:26.344 --> 01:25:28.568
- [Tyler] Yeah, I think Joe
has a lantern back in the tent.

01:25:28.568 --> 01:25:30.392
Hold on, hold on.
- Oh my god.

01:25:30.392 --> 01:25:31.809
- [Winston] Shit.

01:25:33.116 --> 01:25:34.615
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

01:25:34.615 --> 01:25:36.016
- Is he all right?
- Oh my god.

01:25:36.016 --> 01:25:37.829
He's really hurt, you guys.
- No no no no.

01:25:37.829 --> 01:25:39.856
- Okay guys, I know I don't
wanna fuckin' admit this,

01:25:39.856 --> 01:25:40.938
but I think it's pretty obvious

01:25:40.938 --> 01:25:42.400
that Winston did something to Abby.

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.835
- Okay Margot, slow down.

01:25:43.835 --> 01:25:45.296
You know, we didn't see all the tape.

01:25:45.296 --> 01:25:46.994
We're not 100% sure he did it.

01:25:46.994 --> 01:25:48.228
- Can we just figure out
something to do please?

01:25:48.228 --> 01:25:49.126
I think it's really bad.

01:25:49.126 --> 01:25:50.610
- Okay yeah, yeah.

01:25:50.610 --> 01:25:53.333
Julia, don't you have a
first aid kit in the car?

01:25:53.333 --> 01:25:54.166
- Yes.

01:25:54.166 --> 01:25:54.999
Yeah, I do.

01:25:54.999 --> 01:25:55.832
- [Tyler] Okay, why don't you go get that?

01:25:55.832 --> 01:25:56.665
Okay, easy.

01:25:56.665 --> 01:25:57.998
Easy, easy, pal.

01:25:59.276 --> 01:26:02.609
(soft foreboding music)

01:26:04.775 --> 01:26:09.069
(gravel crunching)
(Winston breathing heavily)

01:26:09.069 --> 01:26:11.569
(car dinging)

01:26:24.602 --> 01:26:27.435
(Winston wincing)

01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:36.270
- [Julia] What the fuck?

01:26:40.507 --> 01:26:42.133
- Just follow it.

01:26:42.133 --> 01:26:44.332
You got a concussion, man.

01:26:44.332 --> 01:26:46.474
- You guys, the car's missing.

01:26:46.474 --> 01:26:47.307
- [Tyler] What?

01:26:47.307 --> 01:26:48.140
- Are you fuckin' kidding me?

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:49.556
- [Julia] I don't know,
somebody must've stolen it.

01:26:49.556 --> 01:26:50.389
- [Nate] What do you mean
someone stole the car?

01:26:50.389 --> 01:26:52.086
- Okay, guys seriously.
- It's missing!

01:26:52.086 --> 01:26:53.217
- We need to go into town.

01:26:53.217 --> 01:26:54.265
- How are we gonna go into town, Margot?

01:26:54.265 --> 01:26:56.068
It's 10 fucking miles.
- You think he can walk?

01:26:56.068 --> 01:26:57.617
There's no other choice at this point.

01:26:57.617 --> 01:26:58.450
- Yeah, yeah.

01:26:58.450 --> 01:26:59.283
- Can you get up?
- I think so, yeah.

01:26:59.283 --> 01:27:01.793
- [Tyler] All right, well
let's get him up then.

01:27:01.793 --> 01:27:02.626
(Nate groaning)

01:27:02.626 --> 01:27:03.508
- Okay, yup.

01:27:03.508 --> 01:27:04.341
- Okay.
- Lean on me.

01:27:04.341 --> 01:27:06.174
- All right.
- Come on.

01:27:08.769 --> 01:27:10.650
Careful, careful.

01:27:10.650 --> 01:27:11.903
- Oh my god.
- Holy shit.

01:27:11.903 --> 01:27:13.569
- We got your friend.

01:27:13.569 --> 01:27:15.930
You better pack up and get out.

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:17.173
- Holy shit.
- What the fuck?

01:27:17.173 --> 01:27:18.629
Oh my god.
- Fuck these guys.

01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:19.462
- No, no, no.

01:27:19.462 --> 01:27:20.295
Nate, Nate, Nate, Nate.
- Nate, stop.

01:27:20.295 --> 01:27:21.657
- Nate, get back.
- Nate.

01:27:21.657 --> 01:27:23.936
- Okay.
- Go, we need to go.

01:27:23.936 --> 01:27:27.483
- Let's get him back on the couch.

01:27:27.483 --> 01:27:30.643
(Nate wincing)
Get him down.

01:27:30.643 --> 01:27:32.081
- I knew it, man.

01:27:32.081 --> 01:27:33.987
That's like meth gangs, dudes.

01:27:33.987 --> 01:27:34.820
- Stop.

01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:35.717
They have Winston, you guys.

01:27:35.717 --> 01:27:36.550
- We can't go out there.

01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:37.383
They might fuckin' kill us.

01:27:37.383 --> 01:27:38.216
- Well if we stay in here,

01:27:38.216 --> 01:27:39.049
they're gonna kill Winston.

01:27:39.049 --> 01:27:39.882
- Okay, well what do you wanna do?

01:27:39.882 --> 01:27:40.715
- I don't know.

01:27:40.715 --> 01:27:41.589
- You wanna sacrifice the whole fuckin'--

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:43.382
- Everybody shut the fuck up!

01:27:43.382 --> 01:27:45.460
I did not come out here in
the middle of bum-fuck nowhere

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:46.953
to get attacked by some inbred hicks.

01:27:46.953 --> 01:27:48.907
There's two of them
and there's four of us.

01:27:48.907 --> 01:27:50.606
Everybody grab a goddamn weapon.

01:27:50.606 --> 01:27:52.075
If they want a fight,
(gun cocking)

01:27:52.075 --> 01:27:53.390
I'm gonna give 'em a fight.

01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:54.277
- Dude, this is so badass.

01:27:54.277 --> 01:27:55.110
Oh my god.

01:27:56.839 --> 01:27:58.345
- Oh my god, they have guns?
- They have guns.

01:27:58.345 --> 01:27:59.178
- Oh my god, oh my god.

01:27:59.178 --> 01:28:00.011
Oh, hey hey hey.

01:28:00.011 --> 01:28:00.844
The guns are fake.

01:28:00.844 --> 01:28:01.677
Wait, wait.

01:28:01.677 --> 01:28:04.448
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
- Fuck you guys!

01:28:04.448 --> 01:28:06.502
- He's okay, he's okay.
- Oh my god,

01:28:06.502 --> 01:28:07.927
what is wrong with you?

01:28:07.927 --> 01:28:08.760
Are you okay?
- He's fine, he's fine.

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:09.593
Seriously, he's fine.

01:28:09.593 --> 01:28:10.426
He's okay.

01:28:10.426 --> 01:28:11.317
- Are you guys out of your fucking mind?

01:28:11.317 --> 01:28:12.240
- We can explain.

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:13.929
Some of the locals didn't like the whole

01:28:13.929 --> 01:28:15.102
home-sharing tourism thing.

01:28:15.102 --> 01:28:16.277
Thought you guys were ruining

01:28:16.277 --> 01:28:18.198
like their retirement community and stuff.

01:28:18.198 --> 01:28:19.584
- Some of the locals?

01:28:19.584 --> 01:28:20.563
- Our parents.

01:28:20.563 --> 01:28:21.742
We really didn't wanna hurt you guys.

01:28:21.742 --> 01:28:23.113
It was really just supposed to be a goof.

01:28:23.113 --> 01:28:24.117
We just wanted to prank you guys

01:28:24.117 --> 01:28:25.835
and make sure you guys
never wanted to back here.

01:28:25.835 --> 01:28:27.552
- You guys have been doing
this this whole weekend,

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:28.424
the gunshots?

01:28:28.424 --> 01:28:30.672
- Spying on us in the bushes?
- Cutting the phone line?

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:32.018
- Taking our car?

01:28:32.018 --> 01:28:33.757
- Hey now, we didn't steal the car.

01:28:33.757 --> 01:28:35.100
We only took the spark plug.

01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:37.143
- (grunts) Spark plug.

01:28:37.143 --> 01:28:38.373
I knew it was somethin'.

01:28:38.373 --> 01:28:41.128
- Hey assholes, why is my car missing?

01:28:41.128 --> 01:28:42.872
- Shoot, that must've been Tony.

01:28:42.872 --> 01:28:43.763
He must've came by.

01:28:43.763 --> 01:28:45.310
- Is Joe in on this with you?

01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:46.648
- No, not Joe.

01:28:46.648 --> 01:28:47.481
He hates our guts.

01:28:47.481 --> 01:28:48.314
- Yeah, fuck Joe.

01:28:48.314 --> 01:28:49.147
- Where is our friend?

01:28:49.147 --> 01:28:50.260
Where's Abby?

01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:51.809
- We have nothing to do with Abby.

01:28:51.809 --> 01:28:52.687
Ours is all fun and games.

01:28:52.687 --> 01:28:54.387
It was supposed to be one big joke, okay?

01:28:54.387 --> 01:28:56.306
- A lotta fuckin' fun everyone's having.

01:28:56.306 --> 01:28:57.687
- Gimme your phone, I'm callin' the cops.

01:28:57.687 --> 01:28:59.270
- Buddy, no.

01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:00.732
Don't call the sheriff please.

01:29:00.732 --> 01:29:02.202
We had a thing goin' on, right buddy?

01:29:02.202 --> 01:29:03.035
If you can't do it.

01:29:03.035 --> 01:29:04.243
Remember us?

01:29:04.243 --> 01:29:05.410
C'mon, please.

01:29:10.536 --> 01:29:12.453
- Oh my god, oh my god.

01:29:13.407 --> 01:29:16.157
- My god, is that my blunderbuss?

01:29:18.069 --> 01:29:19.069
My tomahawk.

01:29:21.835 --> 01:29:22.668
My luger.

01:29:24.001 --> 01:29:26.879
Hans Goebeler could've touched that.

01:29:26.879 --> 01:29:29.067
Put that down right now.

01:29:29.067 --> 01:29:30.944
- Hey, we thought your little golf buddies

01:29:30.944 --> 01:29:31.777
were gonna kill us.

01:29:31.777 --> 01:29:33.016
They been fuckin' with us all weekend.

01:29:33.016 --> 01:29:35.036
- Doug seriously, it's not how it looks.

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:36.079
Please, man.

01:29:36.079 --> 01:29:37.079
- Goddammit.

01:29:39.408 --> 01:29:42.382
Brent, Chip, I told your parents

01:29:42.382 --> 01:29:44.379
that I would shoot you on the spot

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.528
if I saw you on my property again.

01:29:46.528 --> 01:29:47.536
- It's not the way it looks, man.

01:29:47.536 --> 01:29:48.369
It was a goof.

01:29:48.369 --> 01:29:49.202
We were just messin' around.

01:29:49.202 --> 01:29:50.035
We were just prankin' 'em, please.

01:29:50.035 --> 01:29:51.306
- This is not the way
it was supposed to go.

01:29:51.306 --> 01:29:52.337
- [Winston] You put a bag over my head

01:29:52.337 --> 01:29:53.170
and pointed a gun at me.

01:29:53.170 --> 01:29:54.123
It was the air pistol.

01:29:54.123 --> 01:29:56.587
- So help me God, you're goin' to Chino

01:29:56.587 --> 01:29:59.504
if I have anything to say about it.

01:30:02.455 --> 01:30:03.379
You,

01:30:03.379 --> 01:30:07.963
you treated my beautiful
home like a frat house.

01:30:07.963 --> 01:30:10.283
You're goin' to jail too.

01:30:10.283 --> 01:30:11.450
You're all goin' behind bars.

01:30:11.450 --> 01:30:15.264
- We didn't do anything
illegal for the most part.

01:30:15.264 --> 01:30:19.248
- You deliberately violated
section six, article three

01:30:19.248 --> 01:30:22.434
of the signed terms and conditions.

01:30:22.434 --> 01:30:24.801
Joe, get me my dossier.

01:30:24.801 --> 01:30:26.708
- Are you fuckin' kidding me?

01:30:26.708 --> 01:30:27.541
- You only know that

01:30:27.541 --> 01:30:29.505
because you put some
kinda surveillance system.

01:30:29.505 --> 01:30:31.373
- It's a security system.

01:30:31.373 --> 01:30:34.006
- You record and then you keep the files.

01:30:34.006 --> 01:30:36.247
- I delete them when the guests leave.

01:30:36.247 --> 01:30:39.180
- You have 2 1/2 years
worth of footage, bro.

01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:40.658
- It's my right as an American.

01:30:40.658 --> 01:30:42.528
- Oh, so you just record people showering

01:30:42.528 --> 01:30:43.361
and then watch it?

01:30:43.361 --> 01:30:44.672
What kind of a pervert are you?

01:30:44.672 --> 01:30:45.589
No offense.

01:30:46.835 --> 01:30:48.472
- Not what I do.

01:30:48.472 --> 01:30:50.726
- Then you get your son
to come over and what,

01:30:50.726 --> 01:30:52.729
pretend like he's a
repairman to fix a jacuzzi?

01:30:52.729 --> 01:30:54.702
I mean, what's the angle on that one?

01:30:54.702 --> 01:30:55.824
- I mean if it means anything,

01:30:55.824 --> 01:30:57.036
I had a really nice time, guys.

01:30:57.036 --> 01:30:58.934
- Okay, well if you had
such a nice time Joe,

01:30:58.934 --> 01:31:00.785
why'd you steal the gun in
the middle of the night?

01:31:00.785 --> 01:31:01.785
- Allegedly.

01:31:04.928 --> 01:31:07.011
- You touched the pistol?

01:31:09.481 --> 01:31:10.314
- Dad.

01:31:10.314 --> 01:31:14.668
- Look, we've talked about
this 1,000 times, Joe.

01:31:14.668 --> 01:31:16.168
That is not a toy.

01:31:17.251 --> 01:31:19.108
It is not a prop.

01:31:19.108 --> 01:31:21.114
It is not a video game.

01:31:21.114 --> 01:31:23.537
It is not something to show the girls.

01:31:23.537 --> 01:31:27.037
It's not something to touch yourself with.

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.987
- Well when do I get to touch it?

01:31:29.987 --> 01:31:31.222
You know, you keep it locked up

01:31:31.222 --> 01:31:34.002
like it's some kind of Vatican treasure

01:31:34.002 --> 01:31:36.354
and then people check in
and you wave it around

01:31:36.354 --> 01:31:37.198
and you let them touch it.

01:31:37.198 --> 01:31:39.770
Everyone gets to touch
it, but not old Joe.

01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:41.398
Well when is it gonna be goddamn time

01:31:41.398 --> 01:31:43.028
for Joe to touch it?

01:31:43.028 --> 01:31:46.111
(muffled chattering)

01:31:51.376 --> 01:31:54.339
(phone chiming)

01:31:54.339 --> 01:31:55.172
- Hello?

01:31:55.172 --> 01:31:56.130
- [Abby] Julia.

01:31:56.130 --> 01:31:56.963
Oh thank, god.

01:31:56.963 --> 01:31:58.580
I've been trying to get
in touch with you all day,

01:31:58.580 --> 01:31:59.663
are you okay?

01:32:01.348 --> 01:32:02.431
- Yeah, yeah.

01:32:03.406 --> 01:32:04.978
We're okay, are you okay?

01:32:04.978 --> 01:32:05.921
- [Abby] Yeah.

01:32:05.921 --> 01:32:08.072
Winston told me about what Tyler did.

01:32:08.072 --> 01:32:08.905
Oh god, Jules.

01:32:08.905 --> 01:32:09.738
I just felt so horrible.

01:32:09.738 --> 01:32:11.679
I couldn't be there when you guys woke up.

01:32:11.679 --> 01:32:13.178
I ran back in town and called Mitch

01:32:13.178 --> 01:32:14.477
and he came and got me.

01:32:14.477 --> 01:32:15.758
I'm so sorry to do that to you.

01:32:15.758 --> 01:32:17.231
Is everything okay?

01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:19.482
- Yup, yeah, all good.

01:32:19.482 --> 01:32:21.645
- [Abby] Well, I'm
gonna get back to Mitch.

01:32:21.645 --> 01:32:23.731
But let's chat when you
guys get back, all right?

01:32:23.731 --> 01:32:24.591
- Okay.
- Have fun.

01:32:24.591 --> 01:32:25.424
- Yup.

01:32:26.362 --> 01:32:27.704
- Who was it?

01:32:27.704 --> 01:32:28.542
- That was Abby.

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:29.375
- What?

01:32:29.375 --> 01:32:30.208
Is she okay?

01:32:30.208 --> 01:32:32.509
- Yeah, she ran into town
and she's with Mitch.

01:32:32.509 --> 01:32:33.726
She's okay.

01:32:33.726 --> 01:32:36.809
(muffled chattering)

01:32:42.793 --> 01:32:43.626
Shut up!

01:32:44.632 --> 01:32:46.715
There's an easy solution.

01:32:56.235 --> 01:32:57.404
- Happy birthday.

01:32:57.404 --> 01:32:58.404
- Thank you.

01:33:03.353 --> 01:33:06.111
How was your daughter's soccer game?

01:33:06.111 --> 01:33:08.278
- I don't have a daughter.

01:33:19.389 --> 01:33:22.056
- (grunts) Yup.

01:33:26.497 --> 01:33:30.573
Well good news: I don't have concussion.

01:33:30.573 --> 01:33:32.795
Bad news: they wouldn't give me drugs.

01:33:32.795 --> 01:33:35.930
You know, on account of the rehab.

01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:37.097
My head hurts.

01:33:38.006 --> 01:33:43.006
(soft orchestral music)
(wind whooshing)

01:34:23.358 --> 01:34:26.858
(lively orchestral music)
