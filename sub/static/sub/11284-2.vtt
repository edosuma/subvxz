WE GOT ELEVEN SUBJECTS
APPREHENDED

27:19.138 --> 27:20.337
AND HELD FOR QUESTIONING.

27:20.339 --> 27:21.572
<i> PARKER:</i>
<i> WELL, THAT'S GOOD WORK.</i>

27:21.573 --> 27:22.806
PUBLIC ORDER UNIT'S
HOLDING GROUND NOW,

27:22.808 --> 27:24.675
THIS RIOT'S
PRETTY MUCH OVER.

27:24.677 --> 27:25.676
ANYTHING?

27:25.677 --> 27:26.676
CHECKED EVERY DURST FAMILY
IN TOWN.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.529
NO PHILIPPA.

27:28.530 --> 27:30.380
WELL, THIS CASE WAS PERSONAL.
MAYBE SHE KNEW THE VICTIM.

27:30.383 --> 27:32.383
WHERE DID LUC GO TO SCHOOL?

27:32.385 --> 27:34.084
SEE,
THERE'S A MEMORIAL PAGE.

27:35.187 --> 27:36.854
<i>HE WAS AT GLADWELL HIGH SCHOOL.</i>

27:36.856 --> 27:38.155
LOOK AT THAT.
LUC DID EVERYTHING:

27:38.157 --> 27:40.891
<i> CHESS CLUB, FRENCH,</i>
<i> DEBATING...</i>

27:40.893 --> 27:42.359
HE WAS SUPER-SMART.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.826
<i> JULES:</i>
<i> YEAH. LOOK, IT'S PIPPY.</i>

27:43.829 --> 27:45.896
<i> PERFECT MATCH</i>
<i> TO THE GARAGE CCTV.</i>

27:46.832 --> 27:49.266
(PHONE BUZZES)

27:49.268 --> 27:51.001
JULES: CALLAGHAN.
PARKER: HEY, SPIKE.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.169
WE NEED TO TALK
TO LUC'S FAMILY

27:52.171 --> 27:53.671
BEFORE THIS DAY
GETS ANY DARKER.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.706
<i> I WANT YOU TO DO IT.</i>

27:57.043 --> 27:59.410
CRUISERS SPOTTED GREALY'S CAR
AT JARVIS AND WELLESLEY.

27:59.412 --> 28:00.711
WHICH DIRECTION?

28:00.712 --> 28:02.011
THAT'S ALL WE GOT.
THEY LOST SIGHT.

28:02.012 --> 28:03.311
<i> ED:</i>
<i> OKAY, SAM, ALERT ALL UNITS.</i>

28:03.315 --> 28:05.849
ALERT ALL UNITS,
EYES OPEN.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.651
SORRY, SAM.

28:07.652 --> 28:09.452
NO WORRIES,
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

28:11.257 --> 28:13.023
<i> REGINE:</i>
<i> SHE WAS LUC'S BEST FRIEND.</i>

28:13.025 --> 28:14.825
THEY WERE BOTH
IN THE GIFTED PROGRAM.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.193
THEY STUDIED TOGETHER.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.028
BUT MY HUSBAND
KNOWS HER BEST.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.797
DO YOU THINK MAYBE I COULD
TALK TO HIM FOR A SEC?

28:19.799 --> 28:21.398
<i> REGINE:</i>
<i> HE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.</i>

28:21.400 --> 28:23.100
IT'S FIVE,
HE'S AT THE GREENHOUSE.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.703
THE GREENHOUSE.

28:25.705 --> 28:26.403
WHERE IT HAPPENED?

28:26.405 --> 28:29.273
JEAN-PAUL GOES EVERY DAY.

28:30.409 --> 28:31.341
YOU HEAR THAT?

28:31.343 --> 28:32.810
ALLAN GARDENS;

28:32.811 --> 28:34.278
THAT'S CLOSE TO JARVIS
AND WELLESLEY.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.480
PIPPY'S TAKING GREALY
TO LUC'S FATHER.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.782
<i> PARKER:</i>
<i> IT'S POETIC JUSTICE -</i>
<i> KILL HIM WHERE HE KILLED LUC.</i>

28:38.784 --> 28:40.084
LET'S STEP ON IT.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.985
SPIKE, YOU KEEP AT IT,
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

28:41.987 --> 28:43.120
<i> SPIKE:</i>
<i> COPY. </i>

28:44.056 --> 28:45.956
DID PIPPY HAVE
ANY FAMILY?

28:45.958 --> 28:48.726
SHE NEVER REALLY TALKED
ABOUT THEM.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.794
SHE WOULD COME OVER
AFTER SCHOOL,

28:50.796 --> 28:52.763
THEY WOULD DO
THEIR HOMEWORK TOGETHER.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.234
<i> I DON'T THINK SHE HAD</i>
<i> ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO. </i>

28:57.236 --> 28:58.969
<i> PIPPY:</i>

29:03.976 --> 29:05.776
PLEURO-SOMETHING.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.344
PLEUROTHALLIS.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.313
ORCHIDS.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.915
<i> WHAT WERE WE THINKING?</i>

29:10.916 --> 29:12.516
<i> LUC:</i>
<i> TOTALLY SHOULD'VE WENT</i>
<i> WITH DAISIES.</i>

29:12.517 --> 29:14.117
<i> PIPPY:</i>
<i> YEAH. (LAUGHS)</i>

29:14.120 --> 29:16.320
<i> REGINE:</i>
<i> IT DIDN'T TAKE TIME BEFORE</i>
<i> THERE WAS A PLATE SET FOR HER</i>

29:16.322 --> 29:17.421
<i> MOST NIGHTS.</i>

29:17.423 --> 29:20.191
(CHUCKLES WARMLY)

29:20.192 --> 29:22.960
<i> REGINE:</i>
<i> IT WAS BEAUTIFUL</i>
<i> TO SEE PIPPY BLOSSOM.</i>

29:22.962 --> 29:24.461
SHE HAD A FUTURE.

29:24.463 --> 29:29.233
<i>JEAN-PAUL HELPED HER WITH HER</i>
<i>UNIVERSITY APPLICATIONS.</i>

29:29.235 --> 29:31.802
SHE WAS ACCEPTED
IN THE SAME PROGRAM AS LUC.

29:31.804 --> 29:33.771
AND WHEN YOUR SON DIED?

29:33.773 --> 29:35.539
SHE HAD A BREAKDOWN;

29:36.475 --> 29:39.777
SHE FAILED HER CLASSES
AND DROPPED OUT.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.245
DID YOU STAY IN TOUCH
WITH HER?

29:41.247 --> 29:44.982
FOR A WHILE,
BUT NOTHING WAS THE SAME.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.187
<i> (WEEPING)</i>

29:56.061 --> 29:57.528
I FAILED YOU, SON.

29:57.530 --> 30:00.197
I FAILED YOU
ON EVERY FRONT.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.099
FORGIVE ME,
I TRIED...

30:02.101 --> 30:03.867
I TRIED HARD, YOU KNOW.

30:04.804 --> 30:05.803
I MISS YOU.

30:05.805 --> 30:08.539
(APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS)

30:09.942 --> 30:11.475
HOW DARE YOU?!

30:11.477 --> 30:12.810
GET OUT!

30:12.812 --> 30:13.811
GET OUT NOW!

30:13.813 --> 30:15.529
PIPPY:
I KNEW IT!

30:15.530 --> 30:17.246
I KNEW YOU COULDN'T LET HIM
WALK AWAY EITHER,

30:17.249 --> 30:19.116
LIKE YOU SAID
AT THE COURTHOUSE.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.517
PIPPY,
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

30:20.519 --> 30:22.386
<i> PIPPY:</i>
<i> WHY DOES HE GET TO LIVE?</i>

30:22.388 --> 30:24.388
WELL, HE DOESN'T.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.193
EDDIE, WHAT'S UP?

30:29.194 --> 30:30.327
BILL GREALY
WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY,

30:30.329 --> 30:33.063
GREG.
SO WHAT?
YOU'RE HUMAN.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.501
I GOTTA MAKE GOOD
ON THIS CALL, GREG.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.969
WHY'S THAT?

30:38.971 --> 30:40.571
BECAUSE IT'S MY LAST.

30:48.447 --> 30:51.114
(SUVS ROAR,

30:56.589 --> 30:57.888
<i> PARKER:</i>
<i> OKAY, TEAM,</i>

SAM:
OKAY, WORDY, BOSS,
YOU GO IN STEALTH, GREEN WALL.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.197
JULES, GO BLACK.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.032
I'LL COVER THE CATWALK.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.368
ED, WE'RE STRETCHED THIN,
CAN YOU COVER RED WALL?

31:11.370 --> 31:13.303
YOU GOT IT.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.872
SPIKE,
DOWN TO THE WIRE HERE.

31:14.874 --> 31:17.441
ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN GET
ABOUT PIPPY AND JEAN-PAUL?

31:19.478 --> 31:24.414
I TOLD HIM THAT ALL THAT TALK
WOULD JUST DRAG PIPPY DOWN.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.184
I BEGGED HIM TO MOVE ON,

31:28.487 --> 31:30.587
BUT HE COULDN'T.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.189
<i> PIPPY:</i>
<i> DO YOU SEE THIS?</i>

31:32.191 --> 31:34.224
<i> NOT A SINGLE MENTION</i>

<i> OH WAIT! NOT IN THE PAPER,</i>
<i> NOT ON THE RADIO!</i>

31:36.962 --> 31:37.961
<i> JEAN-PAUL:</i>
<i> LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.</i>

31:37.963 --> 31:39.596
OH, BECAUSE GOD FORBID

31:39.598 --> 31:42.332
PEOPLE SHOULD THINK
WE HAVE A RACE PROBLEM HERE.

31:42.334 --> 31:45.435
WE MIGHT LOSE TOURISTS.
YOU SEE?

31:46.372 --> 31:49.606
JEAN-PAUL:
HE JUST WANTED TO GO AWAY.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.441
<i> PIPPY:</i>

DO YOU THINK
THEY MAY BE CAPABLE

32:11.563 --> 32:14.498
OF KILLING OFFICER GREALY?

AND AT YOUR WIFE,

36:34.927 --> 36:36.693

HOW LUCKY I WAS...

40:14.112 --> 40:19.983
AND HOW EASY EVERYTHING
CAN BE TAKEN AWAY,

40:19.985 --> 40:21.985
