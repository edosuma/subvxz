00:01.333 --> 00:03.542
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.542 --> 00:05.667
XANAX. THAT'S FOR
SEVERE DEPRESSION
AND ANXIETY.

00:05.667 --> 00:06.959
THEY'RE MY MOTHER'S.

00:06.959 --> 00:09.750
MY SCRIPT,
NEW AND IMPROVED.

00:09.750 --> 00:12.000
OH, SO DAWSON AND JOEY
FINALLY GET IT ON, HUH?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.333
ACTUALLY, THE SO-CALLED
DAWSON CHARACTER DOES IT

00:13.333 --> 00:15.417
WITH
THE BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBOR
FROM THE BIG CITY.

00:15.417 --> 00:16.750
CAN'T SEEM TO
FIND A LEADING LADY.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.875
THE PART REQUIRES
A CERTAIN MIXTURE
OF SPIRITED PASSION,

00:18.875 --> 00:21.583
A WIDE-EYED
INNOCENCE,

00:21.583 --> 00:23.708
AND UNPARALLELED
EXTERNAL BEAUTY.

00:23.708 --> 00:26.041
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
A JULIA ROBERTS.

00:26.041 --> 00:29.041
LOOKING FOR A YOU.

00:32.667 --> 00:37.250
[MOVIE THEME MUSIC
PLAYING ON TV]

00:39.250 --> 00:40.917
SO...

00:40.917 --> 00:43.333
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:43.333 --> 00:45.166
THAT WAS THE DIRECTOR'S
CUT, RIGHT?

00:45.166 --> 00:47.208
I MEAN, IT SEEMED
A LOT BLOODIER.

00:47.208 --> 00:49.667
NO, NO, I MEANT
WITH YOU AND ME.

00:49.667 --> 00:50.667
WE DID IT.

00:50.667 --> 00:52.041
DID WHAT?

00:52.041 --> 00:54.291
OUR FIRST OFFICIAL MOVIE
NIGHT, POST-BREAKUP.

00:54.291 --> 00:56.750
AND I'D SAY IT
WENT RATHER WELL.

00:56.750 --> 00:59.375
YEAH. WELL, CONGRATS.
I SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

00:59.375 --> 01:02.333
UH, WHERE ARE
YOU GOING, JOEY?
IT'S EARLY.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.792
WELL, DAWSON, WE WATCHED
THE MOVIE, YOU KNOW.

01:04.792 --> 01:06.750
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
HOLD ON A SECOND.

01:06.750 --> 01:09.250
I GOT SOME PICTURES
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT.

01:12.375 --> 01:14.834
YOU'RE REALLY OK
WITH ALL THIS.

01:14.834 --> 01:15.792
WHAT, YOU AND ME?

01:15.792 --> 01:18.417
YEAH.
YEAH.

01:18.417 --> 01:21.917
I'M JUST SO HAPPY THAT
WE'RE FINALLY PAST ALL THAT
RELATIONSHIP TRAUMA.

01:21.917 --> 01:24.333
GOOD. ME, TOO.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.583
GREAT. SO,

01:26.583 --> 01:29.875
THE BIG DILEMMA,
NOW THAT YOU'RE OFFICIALLY
HELPING ME IN THE MOVIE,

01:29.875 --> 01:32.417
IS WHO DO WE CAST
AS SAMMY?

01:32.417 --> 01:34.417
JOEY, YOU'RE A--

01:34.417 --> 01:37.583
YOU'RE A DISTINCT,
UNATTAINABLE ORIGINAL.

01:37.583 --> 01:40.208
WELL, DAWSON, MAYBE
YOU SHOULD PROGRESS
BEYOND THE NOTION

01:40.208 --> 01:41.250
THAT THE CHARACTER
OF SAMMY IS ME.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.750
I MEAN, WHY DON'T YOU
LOOK FOR AN ACTRESS

01:43.750 --> 01:46.708
WHO CAN BRING HER OWN
UNIQUE INTERPRETATION
TO THE ROLE?

01:46.708 --> 01:48.667
AH...

01:48.667 --> 01:51.625
I'M KIND OF...
AMAZED AT--

01:51.625 --> 01:55.041
AT HOW TOGETHER YOU ARE
ABOUT US.

01:55.041 --> 01:57.959
WELL, I'VE LEARNED
TO LET GO.

01:57.959 --> 02:01.750
PLUS, YOU LET ME GO.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.667
I MEAN, GRANTED,
AT FIRST IT WAS REALLY HARD
FOR ME TO--TO ACCEPT,

02:04.667 --> 02:06.208
BUT...

02:06.208 --> 02:10.291
YOU'VE MOVED ON.
YOU'RE WITH JACK, AND...

02:10.291 --> 02:11.792
YOU LET GO.

02:11.792 --> 02:14.875
SO I IN TURN...
LET GO OF YOU.

02:17.834 --> 02:20.458
YEAH, WELL, UH,

02:20.458 --> 02:22.792
SINCE WE'RE LETTING
GO OF EACH OTHER,

02:22.792 --> 02:25.959
I SHOULD--I REALLY
SHOULD GO THIS TIME.

02:25.959 --> 02:28.750
UH...ANYWAY, YEAH,
'CAUSE I'M REALLY TIRED

02:28.750 --> 02:32.375
AND YOU OBVIOUSLY
HAVE A LOT TO DO, SO...

02:32.375 --> 02:33.792
I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW, JOEY.

02:33.792 --> 02:35.250
YEAH.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.959
UM, GOOD NIGHT.

02:36.959 --> 02:38.583
GOOD NIGHT, JO.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.208
NOW, THE TASK HERE

03:38.208 --> 03:42.500
IS NOT JUST TO REPRESENT
THE SUBJECT.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.708
YOU'RE TRYING TO EVOKE
A FEELING THAT YOU HAVE
FOR THE SUBJECT.

03:45.708 --> 03:50.083
NOW, REMEMBER, THIS--
THIS IS YOUR WORK,
SO PERSONALIZE IT.

03:50.083 --> 03:54.917
IF YOU SEE THE WORLD
IN TRIANGLES,
THEN GO WITH IT.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.208
EXCELLENT WORK,
JOEY.

03:58.208 --> 03:59.834
YOU'RE COMING
ALONG NICELY.

03:59.834 --> 04:02.125
THANKS.

04:09.834 --> 04:12.750
JOEY, HEY.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.333
DAWSON, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:15.333 --> 04:17.250
I HAD TO DO SOME RESEARCH
AT THE COLLEGE LIBRARY,

04:17.250 --> 04:20.166
BUT I WANTED TO GIVE
YOU MY NEW REVISED DRAFT
HOT OFF THE PRESSES.

04:20.166 --> 04:21.875
THANKS,
BUT I'M IN CLASS.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.458
DAWSON.

04:25.834 --> 04:26.834
SHE--SHE'S NAKED.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.375
YEAH, OK,
PEEP SHOW'S OVER.
GET OUT.

04:28.375 --> 04:30.917
NOW, YOU'RE GONNA
GET ME IN TROUBLE.

04:30.917 --> 04:32.375
SORRY, THIS CLASS IS CLOSED
TO WIDE-EYED VISITORS.

04:32.375 --> 04:35.333
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.500
SORRY.

04:47.166 --> 04:50.500
IT SAYS IN HERE I CAN HAVE
THE BUTT I ALWAYS WANTED
IN 3 WEEKS.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.375
Andie: PACEY,
I'VE SEEN YOUR BUTT.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.375
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

04:53.375 --> 04:56.291
I TELL YOU,
IT'S REALLY NO WONDER

04:56.291 --> 04:58.959
WE HAVE SUCH AN OBSESSION
WITH THE POSTERIOR.

04:58.959 --> 05:02.208
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO GET A GOOD SENSE OF
ONE'S OWN BUTT, YOU KNOW?

05:02.208 --> 05:04.834
PACEY, ARE YOU CHECKING
OUT YOUR OWN BUTT
IN THE MIRROR?

05:04.834 --> 05:07.834
ME? NO.

05:31.792 --> 05:33.750
YOU KNOW, I DO AGREE
WITH YOU, THOUGH.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.834
THIS BUTT BELONGS
IN THE HALL OF FAME.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

05:35.834 --> 05:37.000
MMM,

05:37.000 --> 05:38.458
NICE TRY.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.041
SEE ANYTHING YOU LIKE?

06:18.625 --> 06:20.458
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE THE--

06:20.458 --> 06:22.417
MODEL.

06:22.417 --> 06:23.708
MY NAME'S DEVON.

06:23.708 --> 06:25.417
HI. DAWSON.

06:25.417 --> 06:28.875
UM...YOU MUST THINK
I'M A TOTAL PERV.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.875
ACTUALLY, I WAS LEANING
MORE TOWARDS DEVIANT.

06:31.875 --> 06:35.708
MY, UH, PSYCH PROFESSOR WOULD
SAY THAT YOU WERE SUFFERING

06:35.708 --> 06:37.708
FROM SOME SORT OF,
UH, LATENT DESIRE,

06:37.708 --> 06:39.000
THE NEED FOR SOMEONE
TO WATCH YOU

06:39.000 --> 06:41.750
WATCHING.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.208
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

06:43.208 --> 06:44.917
I WAS ACTUALLY
JUST DROPPING SOMETHING
OFF TO A FRIEND.

06:44.917 --> 06:45.792
NO UNDERLYING PSYCHOSIS.

06:45.792 --> 06:48.208
OH, PSYCH'S
NOT MY MAJOR ANYWAY.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.792
UM...

06:50.792 --> 06:52.959
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

06:52.959 --> 06:54.500
UH, MODEL NAKED.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.917
I MEAN, IT'S GOT
TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.500
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I'M A DRAMA MAJOR,

06:58.500 --> 06:59.625
SO I JUST KIND OF LOOK AT IT
AS AN ACTING EXERCISE.

06:59.625 --> 07:02.458
PLUS IT HELPS THAT
THE MONEY DOESN'T SUCK.

07:02.458 --> 07:03.917
SO YOU'RE AN ACTRESS.

07:03.917 --> 07:04.708
MM-HMM.
THAT'S INTERESTING.

07:04.708 --> 07:07.333
I'M, UH,
DIRECTING A MOVIE.

07:07.333 --> 07:10.083
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THEY
HAD A FILM SCHOOL HERE.

07:10.083 --> 07:12.583
THEY DON'T.
I'M, UH, I'M STILL
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

07:12.583 --> 07:14.750
OH. AND YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE YOUR FIRST FILM.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.583
THAT'S CUTE. GOOD LUCK.

07:16.583 --> 07:19.083
IT'S MY SECOND FILM,
ACTUALLY.

07:19.083 --> 07:22.917
MY FIRST FILM WON
THE JUNIOR DIVISION
BOSTON FILM FESTIVAL,

07:22.917 --> 07:25.041
AND THEY
GAVE ME THE FUNDS TO
MAKE MY SECOND EFFORT.

07:25.041 --> 07:26.041
IMPRESSIVE.

07:26.041 --> 07:28.917
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:28.917 --> 07:30.417
I--I'M ACTUALLY
STILL CASTING.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.625
THERE--THERE'S ONE PART
I HAVEN'T CAST YET.
IT'S ONE OF THE LEADS.

07:33.625 --> 07:36.375
UM, AND WE, UM, START
SHOOTING IN 2 DAYS.

07:36.375 --> 07:38.750
IT'S KIND OF
A CRUNCH SITUATION,

07:38.750 --> 07:41.291
BUT, UM, I'D LOVE IT
IF YOU'D READ IT.

07:41.291 --> 07:44.250
AND IT'S FUNDED BY

07:44.250 --> 07:46.166
THE BOSTON FILM FESTIVAL?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.667
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.959
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR SKEPTICISM,

07:49.959 --> 07:52.834
BUT, UH, GIVE IT A READ.

07:52.834 --> 07:54.500
IT'S THE PART OF SAMMY.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.583
UH, MY ADDRESS
AND PHONE NUMBER
ARE ON THE FRONT.

07:55.583 --> 07:58.125
I'D LOVE TO HEAR
WHAT YOU THINK.

07:58.125 --> 07:59.208
CAREFUL, DAWSON.

07:59.208 --> 08:03.375
STRONGER MEN HAVE BEEN
CRUSHED BY WHAT I THINK.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.834
OH, GRAMS,
YOU'RE A GODSEND.

08:12.834 --> 08:16.125
WE ARE IN DESPERATE
NEED OF SNACKS
FOR REHEARSAL.

08:16.125 --> 08:17.625
OH.

08:17.625 --> 08:20.583
OH, JENNIFER, DEAR,
THIS IS TYSON HICKS.

08:20.583 --> 08:24.208
HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO
HELP ME WITH MY GROCERIES.

08:24.208 --> 08:25.500
UH, TY, ACTUALLY.
IT'S GREAT TO MEET YOU.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.000
NICE TO MEET YOU,
TOO, TY.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.542
SO YOUR GRANDMA TELLS ME
THAT, UH, YOU'RE WORKING
ON A MOVIE.

08:30.542 --> 08:33.542
YEAH. YEAH, UM,
WE'RE JUST GEARING UP
TO START.

08:33.542 --> 08:37.291
WELL, JENNIFER, TYSON
HAS EXPRESSED AN INTEREST

08:37.291 --> 08:38.625
IN HELPING OUT
WITH THE PICTURE.

08:38.625 --> 08:41.166
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE
SHORT-STAFFED?

08:41.166 --> 08:44.542
YEAH. YEAH, UM,

08:44.542 --> 08:47.000
DO YOU HAVE ANY
EXPERIENCE WORKING ON
A FILM SET BEFORE?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.667
WELL, NO, BUT, UM,
I'VE WORKED ON A BUNCH
OF THEATER PRODUCTIONS,

08:50.667 --> 08:52.917
AND I'M PRETTY
GOOD WITH MY HANDS

08:52.917 --> 08:54.458
AND A FAST LEARNER.

08:54.458 --> 08:57.333
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
WE CAN USE ALL THE HELP
THAT WE CAN GET, TY.

08:57.333 --> 09:00.333
EVEN GRAMS HAS BEEN
DOING CRAFT SERVICE,
SO...

09:00.333 --> 09:03.375
WELL, GREAT. UH, WELL,
YOU CAN USE ME FOR ANYTHING.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.166
EXCELLENT.

09:05.166 --> 09:07.834
SO YOU FOUND A BOTTLE
OF PRESCRIPTION PILLS.
SO WHAT, PACEY?

09:07.834 --> 09:10.708
TAKE A LOOK IN MY PARENTS'
MEDICINE CABINET.

09:10.708 --> 09:12.375
IT'S A VERITABLE PHARMACY.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.250
YEAH, BUT THIS
IS XANAX, DAWSON.

09:14.250 --> 09:15.417
NOT EXACTLY YOUR TYPICAL
SATURDAY NIGHT
MUSCLE RELAXANT.

09:15.417 --> 09:18.458
IT'S FOR SEVERE ANXIETY.

09:20.041 --> 09:24.041
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED
ANDIE BEING ANY MORE
HIGH-STRUNG LATELY, HAVE YOU?

09:24.041 --> 09:28.667
UH, NO. I'VE BEEN TOO
BUSY WATCHING HER BOUNCE
OFF THE WALLS.

09:28.667 --> 09:30.166
PACEY,
IF YOU'RE WORRIED,

09:30.166 --> 09:31.750
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
JUST ASK HER ABOUT IT?

09:31.750 --> 09:33.750
BECAUSE, MAN,
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
THE SITUATION ANY WORSE.

09:33.750 --> 09:36.542
SHE'S ALREADY UNDER
ENOUGH STRESS AS IT IS
WITH HER FAMILY.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.875
YOU KNOW,
THE WAY I FIGURE IT,

09:38.875 --> 09:41.041
IF SHE WANTS TO OPEN UP
TO ME, SHE WILL, YOU KNOW.

09:41.041 --> 09:42.583
BUT IT'S ALSO NOT
REALLY IN MY NATURE

09:42.583 --> 09:44.291
TO JUST SIT BY
WHILE THE GIRL SUFFERS.

09:44.291 --> 09:45.792
I MEAN, I WANT
TO HELP HER, BUT...

09:45.792 --> 09:47.667
IF SHE'S OPERATING
UNDER A LOT OF STRESS
THOUGH, PACEY,

09:47.667 --> 09:49.250
THE ONLY THING
YOU CAN REALLY DO

09:49.250 --> 09:50.667
IS MAKE SURE
THAT THE TIME
SHE SPENDS WITH YOU

09:50.667 --> 09:51.917
IS AS STRESS-FREE
AS POSSIBLE.

09:51.917 --> 09:54.542
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
HELP HER HAVE FUN.

09:54.542 --> 09:56.792
DAWSON, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING, MAN?

09:56.792 --> 09:59.708
WE JUST PUT
THE E.T.  POSTER UP.

09:59.708 --> 10:01.291
WHY ARE YOU
TAKING IT DOWN?

10:01.291 --> 10:02.333
UP THERE,
IT'S NOT IN THE SHOT.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.792
OVER HERE, IT'D BE
IN THE PERFECT POSITION.

10:04.792 --> 10:06.750
YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND
THAT WE HAVE BUDGETARY
CONSTRAINTS,

10:06.750 --> 10:09.500
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
TELLING YOUR LIFE STORY
IN YOUR OWN BEDROOM

10:09.500 --> 10:11.250
IS A LITTLE PERVERSE,
EVEN FOR YOU?

10:23.166 --> 10:24.750
HEY THERE.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.750
HEY. HOW ARE YOU?

10:26.750 --> 10:28.959
GOOD.
I READ YOUR SCRIPT.

10:28.959 --> 10:30.583
YOU DID? GREAT.
AND, UH,

10:30.583 --> 10:33.500
WHAT DID YOU--
WHAT'D YOU THINK?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.083
I DIDN'T LOVE IT.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.375
REALLY?

10:36.375 --> 10:37.792
I MEAN, ALL THE--ANGST
AND THE OVERANALYZING,

10:37.792 --> 10:40.625
AND THE HESITANCY
TO ACT ON ANYTHING.

10:40.625 --> 10:43.792
I MEAN, I REALLY HAD
TO SEARCH MY PSYCHE AND
CALL BACK MY ADOLESCENCE.

10:43.792 --> 10:46.041
HUH. 2 WHOLE YEARS AGO.

10:46.041 --> 10:49.125
DAWSON, THERE--THERE'S
A VAST DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US.

10:49.125 --> 10:54.083
ANYWAY, THE SCRIPT'S
A LITTLE HEAVY-HANDED
AND OVERLY VERBOSE.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.792
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED.

10:56.792 --> 10:58.458
WHAT I'M SAYING IS

10:58.458 --> 11:01.041
THAT I MANAGED
TO MUDDLE THROUGH
THE $20 WORDS

11:01.041 --> 11:03.875
AND THE PSYCHO-SPEAK
AND GOT TO THE CORE OF
THE SAMMY CHARACTER.

11:03.875 --> 11:07.667
LOOK, I THINK WHAT I'M SAYING
IS I'M NOT INTERESTED.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.667
I MEAN, JUST--
THE MORE--THE MORE
I THINK ABOUT IT,

11:10.667 --> 11:13.417
YOU'RE JUST--
YOU'RE REALLY JUST
NOT RIGHT FOR THE PART.

11:13.417 --> 11:14.750
YOU'RE A LITTLE...
SMALL.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.708
WAIT. SO--SO
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

11:16.708 --> 11:19.125
BECAUSE I HAD AN OPINION
OF YOUR SCRIPT,

11:19.125 --> 11:20.166
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET ME
READ FOR THE PART?

11:20.166 --> 11:22.417
WELL, HERE'S THE COLD,
HARD TRUTH, DAWSON.

11:22.417 --> 11:26.291
IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM,
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA MAKE IT.

11:26.291 --> 11:29.000
GOOD LUCK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.291
I'M SORRY
I WASTED MY TIME.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.166
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE. DEVON.

11:33.166 --> 11:37.208
I'M--I'M SORRY.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE I OVERREACTED.

11:37.208 --> 11:38.834
HERE--I MEAN, YOU CAME
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE.

11:38.834 --> 11:40.875
THE LEAST I COULD
LET YOU DO IS AUDITION,
RIGHT?

11:43.166 --> 11:47.917
SO, UH, WE--WE
CAN READ SCENE 5.
IT STARTS ON PAGE--

11:47.917 --> 11:50.250
ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT
WE'D DO SCENE 15,
CLOSER TO THE MIDDLE.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.917
OK.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.792
OK, JUST, UH,
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

12:00.208 --> 12:01.750
SURE.

12:08.917 --> 12:10.208
OK.

12:10.208 --> 12:16.041
SAMMY, IF YOU COULD
ONLY SEE YOURSELF
THROUGH MY EYES.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.625
YOU KNOW,
FOR THE LONGEST TIME

12:17.625 --> 12:20.625
I THOUGHT THAT
WAS WHAT I WANTED,

12:20.625 --> 12:23.291
FOR THE BOY
ACROSS THE CREEK,

12:23.291 --> 12:26.125
MY BEST FRIEND,

12:26.125 --> 12:28.500
TO SEE ME AS BEAUTIFUL.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.583
BUT THIS IS JUST...

12:32.583 --> 12:35.708
COSMETIC ENHANCEMENT...

12:37.166 --> 12:39.125
AND HAIR SPRAY.

12:48.291 --> 12:51.291
I'M STILL THE SAME
OLD SAMANTHA,

12:51.291 --> 12:55.458
THE GIRL WHO RESIDES ON
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE CREEK.

12:55.458 --> 12:58.750
AND IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY,
WADE, YOU'LL SEE...

13:01.917 --> 13:03.708
IT'S JUST ME.

13:07.917 --> 13:11.417
IS THAT KIND OF
WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND?

13:11.417 --> 13:14.291
THAT--THAT WAS
KIND OF...

13:14.291 --> 13:16.500
PERFECT.

13:30.417 --> 13:32.583
OH. HEY, UM,

13:32.583 --> 13:34.417
I GOTTA GET OUT
OF HERE EARLY

13:34.417 --> 13:38.041
'CAUSE I PROMISED
DAWSON I'D HELP HIM WITH
TOMORROW'S SHOOT, OK?

13:38.041 --> 13:39.458
OK. UM,

13:39.458 --> 13:41.834
YOU THINK HE'LL HAVE US
WORKING, UH, ALL DAY?

13:41.834 --> 13:43.083
US?

13:43.083 --> 13:45.625
YEAH. YEAH, JEN, SHE
SAID THEY WERE UNDERSTAFFED.

13:45.625 --> 13:49.917
SHE ASKED ME TO HELP OUT,
AND BESSIE SAID SHE'D
COVER MY SHIFTS, SO...

13:52.542 --> 13:55.166
AND HOW DOES DAWSON
FEEL ABOUT THIS?

13:55.166 --> 13:56.083
I DON'T KNOW.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.917
OK.

14:06.792 --> 14:09.917
CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

14:15.500 --> 14:16.625
UM, ARE YOU
READY TO ORDER?

14:16.625 --> 14:19.208
READY TO ORDER?

14:19.583 --> 14:21.667
ORDER?

14:23.041 --> 14:25.041
IS EVERYTHING OK?

14:25.041 --> 14:27.500
YEAH. I'LL, UM,

14:27.500 --> 14:31.333
I'LL HAVE A HAMBURGER,
FRIES, AND A DIET COKE.

14:33.500 --> 14:38.125
OK. UM, I'LL BE RIGHT
BACK WITH YOUR DRINK.

14:40.125 --> 14:41.458
THANKS.

14:45.041 --> 14:47.834
UH, JACK, CAN YOU GO

14:47.834 --> 14:49.625
HELP THAT GIRL
OVER THERE?

14:49.625 --> 14:52.250
I MEAN, SHE'S REALLY
WEIRDING ME OUT.

15:00.583 --> 15:01.542
THERE YOU GO.

15:01.542 --> 15:03.708
THANK YOU.

15:03.708 --> 15:04.792
EXCUSE ME, UM,

15:04.792 --> 15:07.333
DO YOU KNOW
THAT WAITRESS?

15:09.125 --> 15:11.417
UH, YEAH, YOU COULD--
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

15:11.417 --> 15:14.750
WOULD YOU MIND
TELLING ME EVERYTHING
YOU KNOW ABOUT HER?

15:18.583 --> 15:20.792
HEY, McPHEE.

15:20.792 --> 15:21.750
HEY.

15:21.750 --> 15:24.959
HOW'S IT HANGIN', GIRL?

15:24.959 --> 15:29.083
OH, I'VE BEEN READING
THE SAME PARAGRAPH FOR
THE LAST 20 MINUTES.

15:29.083 --> 15:31.083
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.333
I'VE GOT
A TON OF HOMEWORK.

15:34.542 --> 15:35.750
[SIGHS]

15:35.750 --> 15:37.500
UM, LISTEN.

15:37.500 --> 15:42.166
I'VE BEEN WRESTLING
WITH WHETHER OR NOT TO
CONFRONT YOU ABOUT THIS,

15:42.166 --> 15:46.166
AND, UH,
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GONNA
GET IT OUT IN THE OPEN.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.458
SO, UH...

15:48.583 --> 15:51.041
DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO
ME ABOUT THE PILL BOTTLE

15:51.041 --> 15:53.375
THAT I SAW IN YOUR
BATHROOM YESTERDAY?

15:53.375 --> 15:55.333
THE XANAX?

15:55.333 --> 15:58.125
IT'S MY MOTHER'S.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.166
IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT,
THAT'S FINE, ANDIE,

16:03.166 --> 16:05.208
BUT DON'T LIE TO ME.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.583
PLEASE.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.708
I STARTED TAKING IT
RIGHT AFTER TIM DIED.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.625
IT HELPS EVEN OUT
MY MOOD SWINGS.

16:20.041 --> 16:22.917
SO WHY DO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU HAD TO HIDE IT FROM ME?

16:24.917 --> 16:26.333
I DON'T KNOW.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.959
I GUESS I WAS AFRAID.
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
YOU'D REACT,

16:29.959 --> 16:33.959
AND, UH...BUT IT DOESN'T
MATTER NOW, ANYWAY,
YOU KNOW.

16:33.959 --> 16:37.000
MY DOCTOR'S NOT GONNA
REFILL MY PRESCRIPTION.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.166
SHE WANTS ME TO TRY
THERAPY FOR MY STRESS,

16:39.166 --> 16:41.667
BUT JUST THINKING
ABOUT THAT MAKES ME EVEN
MORE STRESSED OUT, SO--

16:41.667 --> 16:45.333
WELL, MAYBE THERAPY'S
NOT SUCH A BAD IDEA.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.500
I MEAN, IT COULDN'T HURT.

16:49.125 --> 16:52.625
LOOK, PACEY, I CAN
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
DON'T LOOK SO WORRIED.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.500
I'M OK,

16:56.500 --> 16:58.792
OK?

17:01.417 --> 17:04.165
BUT IF YOU WEREN'T OK,

17:04.165 --> 17:06.290
YOU WOULD TELL ME, RIGHT?

17:06.290 --> 17:08.375
YEAH.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.125
Dawson: OK, SO
THE SCENE WILL OPEN UP

17:10.125 --> 17:11.000
WITH YOU TWO
SITTING ON THE BED.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.959
SAMMY,
YOU'RE ON THE LEFT,

17:12.959 --> 17:14.500
AND, WADE, YOU'LL
BE ON THE RIGHT.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.165
IT'S, UM,
WHEREVER'S COMFORTABLE.
IT'S REALLY CASUAL.

17:17.165 --> 17:20.416
HEY. HOW ARE YOU?
UH, SINCE ABBY'S
LATE AGAIN,

17:20.416 --> 17:22.834
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU COULD READ
THE PART OF KIM?

17:22.834 --> 17:25.834
ENTER FROM OVER HERE.

17:25.834 --> 17:27.875
YEAH. YEAH,
SURE. OK, UM,

17:27.875 --> 17:30.083
UH, WHAT PAGE
ARE YOU GUYS
STARTING ON?

17:30.083 --> 17:30.291
17.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.875
OK, YOU GUYS READY?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.959
AND, ACTION.

17:36.959 --> 17:38.542
HEY, GUYS.

17:38.542 --> 17:40.834
HEY.

17:40.834 --> 17:42.667
I THOUGHT IT
WAS VIDEO NIGHT.

17:42.667 --> 17:46.166
OH, IT IS. KIM DOESN'T
REALLY KNOW ANYONE
HERE IN CREEK SIDE,

17:46.166 --> 17:47.250
SO I JUST INVITED HER
TO JOIN US.

17:47.250 --> 17:50.917
ISN'T WATCHING MOVIES
A LITTLE, OH, MUNDANE

17:50.917 --> 17:53.083
FOR SOMEONE
FROM THE BIG CITY?

17:53.083 --> 17:55.834
Jen: UH, LISTEN,
IF--IF I'M INTRUDING,
I CAN--

17:55.834 --> 17:57.625
Chris:
NO. NO, NOT AT ALL.

17:59.041 --> 18:00.667
THE MORE THE MERRIER.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.041
Dawson: NO, NO, WAIT.

18:02.041 --> 18:03.208
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOLD ON.

18:03.208 --> 18:06.166
CHRIS, THE WAY
YOU'RE SAYING IT NOW,

18:06.166 --> 18:07.041
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
TRYING TO GET THEM
INTO A MENAGE A TROIS.

18:07.041 --> 18:09.250
I MEAN, YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN KIM,

18:09.250 --> 18:10.917
BUT SAMMY'S
JUST YOUR FRIEND.

18:10.917 --> 18:13.625
I MEAN, SHE'S
YOUR BEST FRIEND,
BUT SHE'S JUST A FRIEND.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.375
THE NUANCES, THEY'RE
SUBTLE, BUT THEY'RE
VERY SPECIFIC.

18:16.375 --> 18:19.792
BUT, DAWSON, IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT SAMMY'S INTO ME.

18:19.792 --> 18:20.917
WHAT, AM I JUST
SUPPOSED TO IGNORE THAT?

18:20.917 --> 18:23.917
YEAH--NO, NO, ACTUALLY.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.708
I MEAN, YOU'RE
NOT IGNORING IT,
YOU'RE JUST--

18:25.708 --> 18:27.291
YOU'RE NOT
AWARE OF IT YET.

18:31.375 --> 18:33.208
UM, DAWSON, COME HERE
FOR A SECOND.

18:33.208 --> 18:35.208
THAT'S WHAT I GET
FOR CASTING A JOCK.

18:35.208 --> 18:36.375
HE'S GOT THE INSIGHT
OF A WARTHOG.

18:36.375 --> 18:41.333
Jen:
OK, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST EASE UP A LITTLE.

18:42.917 --> 18:44.500
JOEY.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.458
HEY!

18:47.458 --> 18:50.291
TERRIF. UM, THERE'S--
COME THERE, THERE'S SOMEBODY
I WANT YOU TO MEET.

18:51.291 --> 18:52.875
DEVON, THIS IS JOEY.

18:52.875 --> 18:54.375
JOEY, THIS IS DEVON.

18:54.375 --> 18:56.750
YEAH, YOU CAME
INTO THE ICE HOUSE
YESTERDAY.

18:56.750 --> 19:00.000
YEAH. NOW YOU KNOW WHY
I WAS ACTING SO PECULIAR.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.500
I WAS STUDYING YOU,

19:02.500 --> 19:05.875
SINCE DAWSON TOLD ME
THAT MY CHARACTER WAS
BASED ON YOU, SO--

19:05.875 --> 19:07.708
YOU RECOGNIZE DEVON
FROM ART CLASS?

19:07.708 --> 19:10.875
OH, RIGHT, YEAH.
THE CLOTHES THREW ME
AT FIRST,

19:10.875 --> 19:12.041
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I FIGURED IT OUT.

19:12.041 --> 19:13.458
ALL RIGHT, I'VE GOT TO TALK
TO CHRIS FOR A MINUTE.

19:13.458 --> 19:16.250
SO--BUT YOU TWO TALK,
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

19:16.250 --> 19:19.333
AND, UH, YOU CAN
STUDY HER MANNERISMS.

19:19.333 --> 19:21.208
GREAT. CHRIS.

19:21.208 --> 19:24.875
SO I'M GOING FOR
KIND OF A METHOD APPROACH
TO SAMMY,

19:24.875 --> 19:29.041
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU HAD SOME, YOU KNOW,
CHARACTER INSIGHTS FOR ME.

19:29.041 --> 19:31.792
I HAVE A COUPLE DOZEN
QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK YOU.

19:33.417 --> 19:34.834
A FEW DOZEN?

19:34.834 --> 19:38.750
WELL, I THINK THAT SAMMY
AND WADE ARE SOUL MATES,

19:38.750 --> 19:43.959
WHO WILL BE FOREVER
CONNECTED BY AN OVERPOWERING
TRANSCENDENT LOVE.

19:43.959 --> 19:46.166
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:55.375 --> 19:57.166
WADE, PLEASE STOP.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.166
Dawson: DON'T STOP.
KEEP WALKING.

19:59.166 --> 20:01.208
WHY ARE YOU
RUNNING AWAY FROM ME?

20:01.208 --> 20:02.875
'CAUSE FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN 15 YEARS...

20:02.875 --> 20:07.125
Dawson: WHOA, I'M LOSING
THEM. I'M LOSING THEM.
HOLD ON, I'LL MOVE--

20:07.125 --> 20:08.291
HEY, WHOA!

20:08.291 --> 20:09.291
SORRY, DAWSON.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.250
SORRY, DAWSON.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.041
I'LL CATCH IT NEXT TIME.

20:12.792 --> 20:14.041
UM,

20:14.041 --> 20:17.041
YOU GUYS CAN TAKE 5.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.834
DAWSON, WE SHOULD REALLY
TRY AND GET THE FIRST SHOT OFF

20:19.834 --> 20:21.708
BEFORE WE START
TAKING BREAKS, OK?

20:21.708 --> 20:23.208
GUYS, AHEM,
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

20:23.208 --> 20:28.041
UH, JEN, I'D LIKE TO SAY
THAT THIS ACCIDENT COULD
HAVE BEEN AVOIDED,

20:28.041 --> 20:29.834
BUT WITH YOU
STANDING NEARBY,

20:29.834 --> 20:31.917
I LOSE ALL ABILITY
TO CONCENTRATE

20:31.917 --> 20:34.166
ON THE JOB AT HAND.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.375
DOWN, BOY.

20:37.125 --> 20:39.375
Jack: JOEY,
I WANTED TO ASK YOU,

20:39.375 --> 20:41.333
THIS WHOLE THING REALLY
BOTHERS YOU, DOESN'T IT?

20:41.333 --> 20:45.333
I MEAN, LIFE LAID OUT
FOR THE WORLD TO SEE.

20:45.333 --> 20:47.792
PLEASE, IT'S A MOVIE.
WHY SHOULD IT
BOTHER ME?

20:47.792 --> 20:49.708
'CAUSE
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.667
I MEAN, IF I WAS
TRYING TO GET OVER
SOMEBODY

20:51.667 --> 20:53.250
AND GET ON
WITH MY LIFE,

20:53.250 --> 20:54.708
I THINK
THE LAST THING
THAT I WOULD DO

20:54.708 --> 20:56.250
IS TO MAKE
A MOVIE ABOUT IT.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.708
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO
TELL OLIVER STONE
OVER THERE

20:57.708 --> 20:58.834
THAT THIS WHOLE WAR
IS OVER.

20:58.834 --> 21:01.542
LOOK, DAWSON IS CLEARLY
OVER ME. I PROMISE.

21:01.542 --> 21:03.083
WHERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE?

21:03.083 --> 21:04.500
'CAUSE I HAVE PROOF
TO THE CONTRARY.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.458
DON'T THINK SO MUCH,
JACK.

21:05.458 --> 21:09.041
I MEAN, EVERYTHING
IS GOING TO BE FINE.

21:09.041 --> 21:10.667
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

21:11.834 --> 21:13.542
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:13.542 --> 21:16.750
JUST AS LONG AS
YOU'RE OVER HIM,
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.

21:16.750 --> 21:19.166
DAWSON CAN DO
WHATEVER HE WANTS.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.792
[LOUD FEEDBACK]

22:27.667 --> 22:29.000
HEY.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
HEY. BEING A GOOD BOY?

22:31.000 --> 22:32.166
ALWAYS.

22:32.166 --> 22:32.834
WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.

22:32.834 --> 22:34.959
OHH!

22:34.959 --> 22:37.166
OH, MAN, I'VE
GOT THE WORST KINK.

22:37.166 --> 22:39.208
HERE, HERE, LET ME.

22:39.208 --> 22:40.667
MMM.

22:40.667 --> 22:43.291
FEELS LIKE YOU'VE GOT
SOME EXPERIENCE AT THIS.

22:43.291 --> 22:46.667
IN BEING MANIPULATED
INTO A NECK RUB, YEAH.

22:48.166 --> 22:52.500
MAYBE I CAN ALSO MANIPULATE
YOU INTO COMING OUT
WITH ME TONIGHT.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.917
I MEAN, I THINK THAT ONCE
WE GET THIS SCENE DONE,

22:54.917 --> 22:56.708
I'M REALLY GONNA
NEED TO LOOSEN UP.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.750
I THINK THAT
CAN BE ARRANGED.

22:58.750 --> 23:00.542
OF COURSE, THERE'S
ONE STIPULATION.

23:02.375 --> 23:04.250
YOU GOT TO PUT YOURSELF
IN MY HANDS.

23:04.250 --> 23:08.291
WELL, THEY ARE GOOD HANDS.

23:12.917 --> 23:15.000
Chris: DAWSON, ALL I'M SAYING
IS I DON'T THINK MY CHARACTER
WOULD PLAY IT HURT.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.458
Devon: AND WHERE'S
MY ANGER COMING FROM?
I'M REALLY CONFUSED.

23:18.458 --> 23:19.792
Dawson: I THINK
THAT'S IMPLICIT.

23:19.792 --> 23:21.667
Chris: YOU SEE, I THINK
HE'D TRY AND PLAY IT COOL.

23:21.667 --> 23:22.708
I MEAN, RETAIN
A LITTLE SELF-DIGNITY

23:22.708 --> 23:25.375
AND NOT WEAR ALL
HIS EMOTIONS ON HIS SLEEVE.

23:25.375 --> 23:27.125
AND I DON'T THINK
I'D BLOW A GASKET
OVER THIS.

23:27.125 --> 23:29.375
OK, ALL RIGHT, UM...

23:29.375 --> 23:34.542
CHRIS...OK, NOT EVERYBODY
IS AS COOL AS YOU, OK?

23:34.542 --> 23:38.750
UM, WHEN WADE FINDS OUT
THAT HIS GIRLFRIEND
KISSED ANOTHER GUY,

23:38.750 --> 23:40.917
HE'S...CRUSHED.

23:40.917 --> 23:43.417
OK, THE LAST THING
HE'S THINKING ABOUT IS
RESERVING ANY SELF-DIGNITY.

23:43.417 --> 23:46.792
OK, AND, DEVON,
YOU'RE AN ANGRY GIRL.

23:46.792 --> 23:49.750
I MEAN, THAT'S PART OF
THE ESSENCE OF WHO YOU ARE.

23:49.750 --> 23:52.417
OK, RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE FRUSTRATED THAT WADE

23:52.417 --> 23:54.750
CAN'T SEE THAT YOU'VE
MOVED BEYOND HIM.

23:54.750 --> 23:57.750
DAWSON, MAN,
I CAN'T RELATE.

23:57.750 --> 24:00.333
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.

24:00.333 --> 24:02.583
OK, UM...

24:08.917 --> 24:09.542
IT'S AGONY.

24:12.291 --> 24:15.792
COMPLETE,
EXCRUCIATING AGONY.

24:15.792 --> 24:19.125
IT'S LIKE YOUR HEART
HAS BEEN RIPPED OUT
OF YOUR CHEST

24:19.125 --> 24:20.792
AND STOMPED ON,

24:20.792 --> 24:21.959
AND YOU CAN'T BREATHE,

24:21.959 --> 24:26.166
YOU--YOU
DON'T WANT TO EAT,
YOU CAN'T FUNCTION.

24:26.166 --> 24:27.959
UH, IT'S...

24:30.875 --> 24:34.250
IT'S THE MOST
INTENSE PAIN THAT
YOU'LL EVER FEEL.

24:34.250 --> 24:36.333
AND THE WORST PART IS,
THERE'S NO WAY
TO RELIEVE IT.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.083
IT'S UNYIELDING,
MERCILESS TORTURE.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.333
AND YOU KNOW

24:39.333 --> 24:41.792
THAT IT'S YOURS
FOR LIFE.

24:43.291 --> 24:46.917
OK, AND, DEVON,
YOU'RE...

24:46.917 --> 24:49.000
YOU FEEL COMPLETELY
MISUNDERSTOOD.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.625
YOU THINK THAT THIS GUY,
WHO YOU BELIEVED IN
YOUR WHOLE LIFE,

24:52.625 --> 24:55.125
CAN'T SEE THAT THE HOPE
AND POTENTIAL OF WHAT
YOU CAN BECOME.

24:55.125 --> 24:56.875
AND SO...

24:56.875 --> 24:59.083
YOU'RE PETRIFIED,
YOU'RE CONFUSED.

24:59.083 --> 25:00.708
YOU'RE AFRAID
TO STAY WITH HIM,

25:00.708 --> 25:02.458
YOU'RE AFRAID
TO STAY WITHOUT HIM.
YOU'RE FRUSTRATED.

25:02.458 --> 25:04.000
YOU--

25:04.000 --> 25:07.583
YOU FEEL SO ALONE.

25:36.750 --> 25:39.959
SAMMY, I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD SPEAK WITH YOU
FOR A MOMENT.

25:39.959 --> 25:41.834
IT'S JOEY.

25:41.834 --> 25:43.625
RIGHT.

25:43.625 --> 25:46.417
ANYWAY, I'M HAVING
A PROBLEM WITH THIS SCENE.

25:46.417 --> 25:48.708
I DON'T REALLY GET
WHERE MY ANGER COMES FROM.

25:48.708 --> 25:52.792
I, PERSONALLY,
AM NOT ANGRY BY NATURE,

25:52.792 --> 25:56.375
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU COULD SHOW ME
HOW YOU DO IT.

25:56.375 --> 25:58.041
DO WHAT?

25:58.041 --> 25:59.291
BE ANGRY.

25:59.291 --> 26:03.542
OH, WELL, SEE,
I, PERSONALLY,
AM NOT ANGRY BY NATURE,

26:03.542 --> 26:07.792
SO THAT WOULD BE THE
FICTIONAL PART OF THIS
AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL TALE.

26:07.792 --> 26:09.000
RIGHT.

26:11.291 --> 26:13.750
SO TELL ME,
HOW DO YOU DATE ONE GUY

26:13.750 --> 26:15.542
WHILE YOU'RE STILL
IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER?

26:15.542 --> 26:19.125
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

26:19.125 --> 26:21.250
DON'T GO THERE.

26:21.250 --> 26:23.000
PLEASE, I SEE YOU
LIP-LOCKED
WITH THAT PUPPY DOG,

26:23.000 --> 26:26.708
AND YET YOUR HEART
IS STILL SO CLEARLY
WITH DAWSON.

26:26.708 --> 26:28.792
WHAT IS THIS JACK GUY,
A SAFETY NET?

26:28.792 --> 26:30.708
OH, YOU'RE GOOD,

26:30.708 --> 26:33.417
BUT I'M NOT THAT EASILY
MANIPULATED.

26:33.417 --> 26:35.875
IS EVERYTHING OK?

26:35.875 --> 26:38.792
TELL ME, JACK,
WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING
THE TRANSITION GUY?

26:38.792 --> 26:40.125
WOULD YOU STOP IT?

26:40.125 --> 26:41.542
YOU KNOW, IT
MUST BE REALLY HARD

26:41.542 --> 26:43.083
OPENING YOUR HEART
TO A GIRL

26:43.083 --> 26:45.750
WHOSE HEART IS RESERVED
FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

26:45.750 --> 26:48.417
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LOOK, YOU ANNOYING LITTLE
THIRD-RATE WANNABE,

26:48.417 --> 26:49.917
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR IRRITATING SELF

26:49.917 --> 26:51.750
AND PREY ON SOMEBODY
WHO DOESN'T SEE THROUGH
YOUR PATHETIC ATTEMPT

26:51.750 --> 26:54.417
TO MASQUERADE BITCHINESS
AS RESEARCH?

26:54.417 --> 26:56.458
THANK YOU.

26:59.917 --> 27:01.625
WHAT WAS THAT?

27:02.625 --> 27:07.667
SHE'S TOO SHORT
TO PLAY ME.

27:07.667 --> 27:11.083
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T HAVE IT?
IT WAS IN YOUR HAIR.

27:11.083 --> 27:12.500
WELL, NOW IT'S NOT.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.125
OK, THAT BARRETTE
IS A PROP, AND I'M
IN CHARGE OF ALL PROPS.

27:15.125 --> 27:16.625
I NEED TO
GET IT BACK.

27:16.625 --> 27:19.625
WELL, YOU'D BETTER
GO FIND IT.
I NEED TO PREPARE.

27:19.625 --> 27:22.083
OH, LIKE I HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE TO START LOOKING

27:22.083 --> 27:23.667
FOR SOME LITTLE TINY
BARRETTE, OK?

27:23.667 --> 27:25.667
YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE
ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE.

27:25.667 --> 27:28.959
HOW COULD YOU HAVE BEEN
SO CARELESS WITH SOMETHING
THAT WASN'T EVEN YOURS?

27:28.959 --> 27:31.542
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THAT PEOPLE HAVE JOBS TO DO,

27:31.542 --> 27:33.458
OR DOES THE WHOLE UNIVERSE
JUST REVOLVE AROUND DEVON?

27:33.458 --> 27:35.208
GET A GRIP,
PROP GIRL.

27:35.208 --> 27:36.792
OK.

27:36.792 --> 27:39.667
DID YOU SEE THAT?
DO YOU BELIEVE HER?

27:39.667 --> 27:42.959
YES, BUT I'M STARTING
TO GET A LITTLE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, McPHEE.

27:42.959 --> 27:44.959
WELL, DON'T BE.
I'M FINE.

27:44.959 --> 27:46.542
NO, YOU'RE REALLY
NOT FINE.

27:46.542 --> 27:48.542
OH, GREAT.
THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT,
PACEY.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.667
HEY, LISTEN.
JUST TELL ME
WHAT TO DO HERE.

27:50.667 --> 27:54.458
'CAUSE I'M STARTING
TO FEEL LIKE I'M GETTING
A LITTLE SCREWED EITHER WAY.

27:54.458 --> 27:56.041
MY DAD IS M.I.A.,

27:56.041 --> 27:57.625
MY MOTHER
IS BARELY LUCID,

27:57.625 --> 27:59.708
I'M HOLDING ON
BY MY FINGERTIPS,

27:59.708 --> 28:01.667
AND YET SOMEHOW
YOU'RE  THE ONE THAT'S SCREWED?

28:01.667 --> 28:03.083
OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

28:03.083 --> 28:04.500
IT'S ALWAYS GOTTA BE
ABOUT PACEY.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.000
DON'T DO THAT, ANDIE.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.625
DON'T MAKE ME
THE BAD GUY.

28:07.625 --> 28:10.125
I'LL BE YOUR SHOULDER
TO CRY ON, I'LL EVEN BE
YOUR PUNCHING BAG,

28:10.125 --> 28:11.542
BUT I'M NOT THE BAD GUY.

28:11.542 --> 28:13.834
PACEY, I KEEP ADDING
THINGS TO MY LIFE
INSTEAD OF SUBTRACTING.

28:13.834 --> 28:16.458
BETWEEN SCHOOL,
MY MOTHER, JACK, YOU,

28:16.458 --> 28:17.834
SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE,
AND THE WAY I SEE IT,

28:17.834 --> 28:21.708
THERE'S ONLY ONE EXPENDABLE
ON THAT LIST.

28:21.708 --> 28:23.291
COME ON, ANDIE.

28:23.291 --> 28:24.208
YOU'RE NOT
IN THE RIGHT PLACE

28:24.208 --> 28:28.166
TO MAKE THAT DECISION
RIGHT NOW, OK?

28:28.166 --> 28:29.500
I--I JUST--
YOU'RE NOT THINKING
STRAIGHT, OK?

28:29.500 --> 28:32.417
YES, I AM.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:32.417 --> 28:34.458
FOR THE FIRST TIME
I'M SEEING EVERYTHING CRYSTAL.

28:34.458 --> 28:37.041
IT'S YOU, PACEY.
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S GOTTA GIVE.

28:37.041 --> 28:39.792
WE NEED TO COOL IT,
BECAUSE US,
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

28:39.792 --> 28:41.708
ANDIE,
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

28:41.708 --> 28:42.625
YES, I DO!

28:42.625 --> 28:44.250
AND IF YOU REALLY
CARE ABOUT ME,

28:44.250 --> 28:45.834
IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO HELP ME,

28:45.834 --> 28:48.417
THEN YOU WOULD JUST
BACK OFF AND LEAVE ME ALONE!

28:56.708 --> 28:58.625
Dawson: AND...ACTION.

28:58.625 --> 28:59.708
AT LEAST LET ME EXPLAIN.

28:59.708 --> 29:03.166
WHAT PURPOSE COULD
THAT POSSIBLY SERVE?

29:03.166 --> 29:04.708
YOU KISSED
ANOTHER GUY.

29:04.708 --> 29:07.959
IN MY MIND,
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY,
UNEQUIVOCALLY

29:07.959 --> 29:10.041
NOTHING LEFT TO SAY.
EVER.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.125
YOU DON'T EVEN
WANT TO KNOW WHY, DO YOU?

29:12.125 --> 29:13.000
YOU'RE NOT EVEN LISTENING!

29:13.000 --> 29:15.625
WHAT JUSTIFIABLE REASON
IS THERE

29:15.625 --> 29:18.750
THAT THE GIRL
WHO SUPPOSEDLY SPENT
HER ENTIRE LIFE

29:18.750 --> 29:21.834
PRETENDING LIKE
I WAS THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERED...

29:23.125 --> 29:26.083
THREW IT ALL AWAY
FOR A 30-SECOND CHEAP THRILL?

29:29.708 --> 29:31.291
AND CUT.

29:31.291 --> 29:32.667
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

29:32.667 --> 29:33.792
THAT WAS GREAT.

29:33.792 --> 29:35.959
Jen: ALL RIGHT. GREAT, GUYS.
GREAT SHOT.

29:35.959 --> 29:39.250
UM, LET'S GET MOVING ON
AND SET UP THE NEXT ONE

29:39.250 --> 29:41.250
BEFORE WE LOSE THE LIGHT,
ALL RIGHT?

29:42.750 --> 29:43.667
WOW.

29:43.667 --> 29:44.667
THAT WAS GREAT.

29:44.667 --> 29:46.625
DID YOU SEE THAT?
WASN'T IT INCREDIBLE?

29:46.625 --> 29:48.000
YEAH.
LOOK, WE NEED TO TALK.

29:54.291 --> 29:56.792
DAWSON, WHY DO YOU INSIST
ON RELIVING

29:56.792 --> 29:58.291
IN EXCRUCIATING DETAIL

29:58.291 --> 30:00.834
ONE OF THE MOST PAINFUL
EXPERIENCES OF OUR LIVES?

30:00.834 --> 30:03.291
IS THIS YOUR PERVERSELY
SELF-DEFEATING WAY
OF MOVING ON,

30:03.291 --> 30:04.750
OR ARE YOU JUST
TRYING TO PUNISH ME?

30:04.750 --> 30:05.792
NEITHER.

30:05.792 --> 30:08.208
HOW CAN YOU BE SO OK
WITH THIS, DAWSON?

30:08.208 --> 30:09.708
I MEAN, DIDN'T WE
MEAN ANYTHING
TO EACH OTHER?

30:09.708 --> 30:12.125
ISN'T ANYTHING SACRED
WITH YOU?

30:12.125 --> 30:13.792
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT
YOU'VE GOTTEN OVER US

30:13.792 --> 30:16.166
AND EVERYTHING
THAT WE WENT THROUGH,

30:16.166 --> 30:18.125
BUT HAS IT EVER
OCCURRED TO YOU
THAT MAYBE I HAVEN'T?

30:18.125 --> 30:20.917
I MEAN, IT TAKES TIME.
I'M HAPPY YOU ARE.

30:20.917 --> 30:23.417
I'M GLAD THAT
YOU'VE FOUND IT SO EASY
JUST TO MOVE ON,

30:23.417 --> 30:26.291
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THIS MOVIE IS JUST
SELF-INDULGENT AND UNFAIR--

30:26.291 --> 30:29.750
WAIT A MINUTE.
LET'S TAKE A LITTLE
REFRESHER COURSE, JOEY.

30:29.750 --> 30:31.166
YOU  BROKE UP WITH  ME,  OK?

30:31.166 --> 30:33.792
YOU HAVE A NEW BOYFRIEND.
YOU'VE FOUND YOUR ART PASSION.

30:33.792 --> 30:34.458
YOU HAVE A WHOLE NEW LIFE.
WHAT DO I HAVE?

30:34.458 --> 30:37.166
A SELF-OBSESSED MOVIE.

30:37.166 --> 30:39.375
WELL, FORGIVE ME
FOR NOT LETTING GO OF
THE ONE THING I'VE GOT LEFT.

30:39.375 --> 30:41.417
BUT THAT'S NOT
HEALTHY, DAWSON.

30:41.417 --> 30:43.875
I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE
AND LISTEN TO YOU
BITCH TO ME

30:43.875 --> 30:44.542
ABOUT WHAT
I'VE DONE, OK, JOEY?

30:44.542 --> 30:47.041
YOU  LEFT  ME.

30:47.041 --> 30:48.834
YOU  DUMPED  ME.
I HAVEN'T MOVED ON.

30:48.834 --> 30:50.500
I HAVEN'T LET GO, OK?
AND THAT'S WHY,

30:50.500 --> 30:52.041
THAT'S WHY I'M CLINGING
FOR DEAR LIFE

30:52.041 --> 30:54.000
TO THE ONE THING THAT
IS KEEPING ME GOING.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.792
THANKS FOR A GOOD DAY.

31:10.792 --> 31:11.959
TOMORROW
CALL TIME'S 8:30.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.166
HEY.

31:18.166 --> 31:18.834
NEED SOME HELP,
GRAMS?

31:18.834 --> 31:21.208
OH, THANK YOU, JENNIFER.

31:22.125 --> 31:23.750
YOU KNOW,
I WATCHED YOU TODAY,

31:23.750 --> 31:24.917
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SAW?

31:24.917 --> 31:28.750
WHY DO I FEEL A LECTURE
COMING ON HERE?

31:28.750 --> 31:30.917
I SAW ALL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE

31:30.917 --> 31:33.375
WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM
FOR A COMMON GOAL,

31:33.375 --> 31:35.291
AND I WAS SO IMPRESSED,
AND...

31:35.291 --> 31:38.792
THEN I REALIZED
WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF EVERYONE,

31:38.792 --> 31:41.208
AND I WAS SO PROUD.

31:41.208 --> 31:43.125
I FOUND MYSELF WATCHING

31:43.125 --> 31:46.125
A BEAUTIFUL, ACCOMPLISHED
YOUNG WOMAN...

31:46.125 --> 31:49.667
WHO JUT HAPPENED TO BE
MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

31:51.208 --> 31:54.208
WELL, I HOPE THAT
I HAD EVERYBODY ELSE
FOOLED, BECAUSE I...

31:54.208 --> 31:57.750
I WAS DEFINITELY
FLYING BY THE SEAT
OF MY PANTS.

31:57.750 --> 32:00.875
OH. A WOMAN MOVIE PRODUCER.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.291
[CHUCKLES]

32:02.291 --> 32:05.333
IN MY DAY,
WOMEN DIDN'T HAVE
MANY OPTIONS.

32:05.333 --> 32:07.417
YOU GOT MARRIED,
YOU RAISED A FAMILY.

32:07.417 --> 32:10.375
BUT NOW...

32:10.375 --> 32:12.959
WHAT A WONDERFUL TIME
TO BE A WOMAN.

32:12.959 --> 32:17.041
YOU CAN DO OR BE
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

32:17.041 --> 32:21.083
AND WITHOUT A MAN
BY YOUR SIDE.

32:21.083 --> 32:23.750
COULDN'T RESIST
THAT ONE, HUH?

32:23.750 --> 32:25.208
WE JUST WRAPPED
THE LAST SHOT,

32:25.208 --> 32:27.291
SO I'M READY TO GO
WHENEVER YOU ARE.

32:28.917 --> 32:30.500
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND, OK?

32:30.500 --> 32:32.500
SURE.

32:33.959 --> 32:35.834
OK. GO AHEAD.

32:35.834 --> 32:39.750
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE DYING
TO GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.792
HAVE A NICE TIME, DEAR.

32:42.792 --> 32:44.708
YOU DESERVE IT.

32:45.792 --> 32:48.041
THANKS, GRAMS.

32:51.625 --> 32:54.333
JUST DON'T STAY OUT
TOO LATE.

32:54.750 --> 32:56.625
I KNOW.

33:05.917 --> 33:08.291
PACEY.

33:08.291 --> 33:10.834
GEE, YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

33:12.291 --> 33:15.583
YEAH, WELL, I SHOULD.
I MEAN...

33:15.583 --> 33:18.041
I KIND OF SCREWED UP
WITH ANDIE.

33:18.041 --> 33:20.333
I PUSHED TOO HARD.

33:20.333 --> 33:21.500
WHAT HAPPENED?

33:22.750 --> 33:25.500
UH...

33:25.500 --> 33:27.917
SHE TOLD ME THAT
I'M THE ELEMENT
IN HER LIFE

33:27.917 --> 33:29.417
THAT SHE CAN DO WITHOUT.

33:29.417 --> 33:30.959
DID SHE MEAN IT?

33:30.959 --> 33:33.250
YEAH, SHE MEANT IT.

33:34.917 --> 33:36.834
THEN LET HER GO.

33:38.583 --> 33:39.875
WHAT?

33:39.875 --> 33:41.917
I THINK YOU SHOULD
LET HER GO.

33:41.917 --> 33:43.792
I MEAN REALLY DO.
DON'T JUST PAY LIP SERVICE.
