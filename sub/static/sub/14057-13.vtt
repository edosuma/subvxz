00:01.067 --> 00:02.193
Previously on The O.C.:

00:02.369 --> 00:03.768
-I'm pregnant.
-Oh, my God.

00:03.937 --> 00:05.370
-My God.
-That's what I said.

00:05.538 --> 00:06.903
-I wanna see Ryan.
-Too soon.

00:07.073 --> 00:09.337
-I've worked hard to give--
-Not for you, for me.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.840
She is the girl for me.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.070
-You're gonna ask her to marry you?
-Julie.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.838
-Are you cheating on Bullit?
-No.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.949
-Will you marry me?
-Oh, my God.

00:25.592 --> 00:27.560
Really? Nothing?

00:27.727 --> 00:30.525
-lt may not sound like a good idea.
-It's not. We're dating.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.995
We just got back together,
and you're proposing...

00:33.166 --> 00:35.600
-...that for Valentine's Day, we do nothing.
-No, no.

00:35.769 --> 00:39.261
We don't have to spend the night apart.
We could just hang out, see a movie.

00:39.439 --> 00:42.203
Oh, God, stop, my head is spinning
from all of the romance.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.708
Taylor, this holiday, us,
it's a recipe for disaster.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.712
Why? I'm needy? I've, on occasion,
been known to stalk you?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.816
It's me too.
I'm distant and unemotional.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.384
And preoccupied?
Could we add that to the list?

00:53.553 --> 00:57.489
Because it just seems like lately
your mind is someplace else.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.827
Taylor, there's no hidden meaning here.

01:01.995 --> 01:05.055
I feel if we don't put pressure on this,
we might get through it.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.459
-So I shouldn't worry?
-No.

01:06.633 --> 01:09.397
Not even when I find
a suspicious address by your bed?

01:09.569 --> 01:12.333
I looked at it
when you were in the bathroom, sorry.

01:12.505 --> 01:13.733
-It's nothing.
-An address.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.341
Not of some girl,
if that's what you're thinking.

01:16.509 --> 01:19.478
Look, I gotta get to work.

01:19.646 --> 01:22.809
But I promise you,
there's nothing to worry about, okay?

01:23.683 --> 01:24.980
-Okay.
-All right.

01:25.151 --> 01:27.016
-So we're good?
-Yeah, we're good.

01:27.187 --> 01:28.916
All right.

01:50.977 --> 01:52.274
Taylor, right?

01:53.246 --> 01:54.474
So it's you.

02:29.749 --> 02:33.378
I don't get it. Ryan hasn't been
to see you at all?

02:33.553 --> 02:36.954
Well, I left a message with him
when I switched hotels.

02:37.123 --> 02:42.789
Told him I was here in case he wanted
to see me, but so far there's no luck.

02:42.962 --> 02:46.454
Taylor, don't mind me asking.
What are you doing here?

02:46.633 --> 02:48.794
Well, I found this address
by Ryan's bed.

02:48.968 --> 02:53.405
He's been distant lately. I thought it
may be a clue, so I came here and then l....

02:53.873 --> 02:56.535
I have emotional problems,
but I'm getting over it.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.939
Well, I'm glad Ryan
at least kept my address...

02:59.112 --> 03:01.376
...since, you know, he's not using it.

03:01.548 --> 03:02.981
Clearly, he wants to reach out.

03:03.149 --> 03:05.344
Maybe he's afraid
or doesn't know how to do it.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.816
Because, you know,
I'd love to talk to him.

03:07.987 --> 03:11.923
Apologize again for that cancer stunt.
But I'm scared if I make the first move--

03:12.091 --> 03:14.355
He's gonna pull away.
You're absolutely right.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.859
I've had a lot of experience with that.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.725
Wait a sec. Idea coming in.

03:18.898 --> 03:21.196
And here it is, okay.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.028
What if I were to get involved?

03:23.203 --> 03:26.195
I could help you guys smooth things over,
broker the peace talks.

03:26.372 --> 03:30.138
You'd be willing to do that,
get in the line of fire?

03:30.310 --> 03:33.609
It's just that there's something
kind of sad about Ryan.

03:33.780 --> 03:37.614
Maybe if he was to mend his relationship
with you, he could be a little happier.

03:37.784 --> 03:40.275
Well, I am all for it.

03:40.453 --> 03:43.013
-Do you have a plan in mind?
-Always.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.491
Is this a second breakfast
or an early lunch?

03:55.668 --> 03:58.193
It's either one.
I was craving French toast, want some?

03:58.371 --> 04:01.829
No, thanks. I'm having flashbacks
to when you were pregnant with Seth.

04:02.008 --> 04:04.977
I know, and all I did
was eat peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches.

04:05.144 --> 04:07.704
I made some of my finest sandwiches
in that era.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.508
And I haven't had
peanut butter and jelly since.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.911
I can't believe we're doing this again.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.718
All the times we tried
to have another one after Seth.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.156
We did have a second.
It just came later in life.

04:22.328 --> 04:23.556
The more, the merrier.

04:23.963 --> 04:26.124
Oh, I just lost my appetite.

04:26.299 --> 04:28.096
-I thought you were starving.
-Cravings.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.169
Up and down like a roller coaster.
I'm gonna get dressed.

04:34.807 --> 04:37.503
-Gordon, it's not Valentine's Day yet.
-Oh, I don't care.

04:37.677 --> 04:40.908
You're my wife, and I'll give you roses
any time I dang well please.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.846
Right. Well, these are certainly beautiful,
but I think I need to remind you--

04:45.018 --> 04:46.246
Oh, I know.

04:46.419 --> 04:49.320
You haven't given me the green light
on that marriage proposal.

04:49.489 --> 04:52.822
But I didn't make 900 million
by being a pessimist.

04:52.992 --> 04:55.256
Did I mention
that there will be no prenup?

04:55.428 --> 05:00.195
Well, yeah, that's so generous. But before
we get on with the rest of our lives--

05:00.366 --> 05:01.993
Right. Valentine's Day.

05:02.168 --> 05:05.433
And I made reservations
at the yacht club, as per your request.

05:05.605 --> 05:08.335
And I did take the liberty of booking us--

05:08.508 --> 05:12.205
That's you and me.
--a suite at the Four Seasons.

05:12.378 --> 05:16.144
Here we are, practically man and wife
and we still haven't sealed the deal.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.011
I guess I'm old-fashioned that way.

05:18.184 --> 05:21.711
Well, if I do say so myself,
you're in for quite a treat.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.188
Can we just not talk about it?

05:24.357 --> 05:26.086
-I can sum it up in one word.
-Don't.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.590
-Bang.
-Yeah.

05:28.561 --> 05:31.155
Oh, sorry, gorgeous.
I'm just a sucker for that pun.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.960
But seriously now, I can't wait
to take you down to Chinatown.

05:36.869 --> 05:39.030
Right. Me too.

05:40.239 --> 05:41.729
Kaitlin. Baby, hi.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.136
How are you?

05:43.309 --> 05:45.834
-What's up, nerd?
-Who you calling nerd, bird legs?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.673
You, nerd.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.748
-Okay, you up for Ping-Pong?
-Ready to get your ass kicked?

05:50.917 --> 05:52.782
-ln your dreams.
-You two play Ping-Pong?

05:52.952 --> 05:56.251
Yeah. We got a table at the office,
and Peanut's getting pretty good.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.017
You think that's lame?

05:59.192 --> 06:01.387
No, it's....

06:01.561 --> 06:03.893
It's, like, totally normal.

06:06.265 --> 06:10.201
Mom, it's just Ping-Pong.
There's no reason to get emotional about it.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.099
-Can I drive the Ferrari?
-No.

06:13.406 --> 06:16.398
Oh, what the hell.
Get her purring, I'll be there in a second.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.310
You're good with her, you know that?

06:22.482 --> 06:24.109
Well, she's like her mom.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.542
She's a special gal,
and a real kick in the pants.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.051
Bye, sweetie.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.868
Well, if the sea otters disappear, the entire
aquatic ecosystem will be disrupted.

06:45.037 --> 06:47.597
I know, we need the sea otters
to eat the sea urchins.

06:47.774 --> 06:50.607
Otherwise, there'd be
a sea urchin population explosion...

06:50.777 --> 06:53.940
...causing some catastrophe
involving the kelp forests.

06:54.113 --> 06:56.172
-I guess you're sick of otters.
-Not at all.

06:56.349 --> 06:59.011
If I have to share you,
I'm glad it could be with otters.

06:59.185 --> 07:01.585
Did you know my website
got 8000 hits yesterday?

07:01.754 --> 07:03.585
I'm gonna have a video conference...

07:03.756 --> 07:06.088
...with someone from Greenpeace
maybe next week?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.386
Hope you can squeeze me in
for Valentine's Day.

07:08.561 --> 07:09.858
Valentine's Day?

07:10.029 --> 07:11.519
Yeah, it's in two days.

07:11.697 --> 07:14.222
-You forgot, didn't you?
-No, of course not.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.890
Here's a psychic. Come on.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.059
-Do we have to?
-Yes.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.408
-Rhode lsland.
-Not bad.

07:23.576 --> 07:26.306
You will go there next year to study art.

07:27.013 --> 07:29.004
You'll do well.

07:30.216 --> 07:32.810
You're really good, psychic lady. Do me.

07:33.986 --> 07:36.216
Strong vibration from you, miss.

07:36.389 --> 07:39.449
Listen, you must beware of falling objects.

07:39.625 --> 07:40.853
Falling objects?

07:41.027 --> 07:43.359
And you're going to appear in the news.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.890
With Justin Timberlake.

07:47.366 --> 07:51.200
-Good. Okay, thank you for your time.
-Wait, this is important.

07:51.370 --> 07:54.271
I see the great love of your life.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.873
Me too.

07:56.042 --> 07:58.101
The name's coming to me. I see it.

07:58.277 --> 08:00.609
Let me give you a little help. Seth.

08:01.380 --> 08:02.938
-No.
-Seth.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.208
No. It's George.

08:05.384 --> 08:06.373
-George?
-George?

08:06.552 --> 08:08.383
A lot of heat surrounding this name.

08:08.554 --> 08:10.317
-You're leaving me for a George?
-No.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.355
She certainly is.

08:12.525 --> 08:15.187
Your destiny is with this George.

08:17.597 --> 08:21.727
Okay. Seth, why don't you go
get me some ice cream? Thank you.

08:22.368 --> 08:26.270
Look. All right, listen, psychic lady,
my boyfriend? His name is Seth.

08:26.439 --> 08:30.500
And if anyone's my destiny, it's him.
So please stop it with all this George stuff.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.212
-Sorry, Summer.
-He did it.

08:36.381 --> 08:38.212
-No, you did it.
-No, I didn't. You did.

08:38.384 --> 08:40.010
-You did.
-What was that?

08:41.419 --> 08:42.751
Destiny?

08:44.857 --> 08:47.223
So this has nothing to do
with Valentine's Day?

08:47.393 --> 08:48.917
No. Why would you think that?

08:49.095 --> 08:52.861
I don't know. You, me, romantic dinner,
you have some sort of surprise....

08:54.834 --> 08:58.395
-Hi, Ryan.
-Hi. Can I talk to you for a minute?

08:58.571 --> 09:00.664
-Would you excuse us?
-No problem.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.205
Thanks.

09:03.309 --> 09:06.642
Well, at least
it wasn't a romantic surprise.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.482
-The note by my bed.
-Yeah, I found it, I went there.

09:10.650 --> 09:14.245
I found your dad and I thought maybe
you were trying to reconnect with him?

09:14.420 --> 09:17.412
-Taylor, it's my business.
-I know. I'm a meddler.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.787
But don't worry, once I lick
my stalking addiction, that's next.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.521
But admit it, you can't tell me
you haven't been thinking about him, right?

09:26.332 --> 09:29.028
-Come on, it's just dinner.
-What are we gonna talk about?

09:29.201 --> 09:31.226
Never met an awkward silence
I couldn't fill.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.100
Consider your Valentine's gift.
Not that we're celebrating.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.070
Yeah, I knew I was gonna pay for that.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.869
Ryan, he's your dad.

09:40.379 --> 09:42.074
Yeah, all right. One dinner.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.716
-Okay.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.218
-Come on.
-Join us.

09:53.025 --> 09:55.926
-She gets her way, doesn't she?
-Yeah, woman's a bulldozer.

10:05.338 --> 10:08.239
So famous couples through time?

10:08.407 --> 10:12.070
Yeah, you know, Romeo and Juliet,
Fred and Wilma.

10:12.244 --> 10:15.304
Sandy and Kirsten Cohen.
Think that's a good idea for a collage?

10:15.481 --> 10:19.941
Seth's gonna love it. And I am very
flattered that Sandy and I made the cut.

10:21.654 --> 10:24.885
I have not looked in these
for a long time.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.820
Gosh, check out that permage.

10:26.993 --> 10:29.587
Top Gun had just come out.
I wasn't thinking clearly.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.593
Guess not.

10:32.264 --> 10:34.425
Is that you and Jimmy Cooper?
Holy guac.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.831
Yeah, that's us at a sweatshirt party.

10:38.704 --> 10:40.934
And here we are at the prom.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.439
Oh, Seth and I have the same picture.

10:45.211 --> 10:47.771
Did you ever think
that Jimmy was the one?

10:50.149 --> 10:52.811
Well, we had planned our lives together.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.577
He was gonna work for my father...

10:54.754 --> 10:57.382
...and I was gonna throw
fabulous dinner parties.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.317
We even had names for our kids.

11:05.364 --> 11:07.127
Then you broke up.

11:12.204 --> 11:13.831
We grew up.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.997
I loved Jimmy a lot when I was your age.

11:17.576 --> 11:20.170
But I changed. So will you.

11:21.447 --> 11:24.382
When you met Sandy,
how did you know that he was the one?

11:24.550 --> 11:26.984
I never imagined myself
with someone like Sandy.

11:33.292 --> 11:34.816
But it just felt right.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.989
Summer.

11:40.166 --> 11:43.033
If you're meant to be with Seth,
it'll happen.

11:43.202 --> 11:46.000
-You just have to be patient.
-I'm not very good at that.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.036
No one is.

11:50.142 --> 11:52.269
So nothing? Really?

11:52.445 --> 11:55.608
No, Frank, Ryan thinks it would be better
for our relationship...

11:55.781 --> 11:59.182
...if we didn't celebrate Valentine's Day.
It's counter-intuitive, I know.

11:59.351 --> 12:02.081
-How's that plan working out for you?
-Not great.

12:02.254 --> 12:03.482
So, Frank, how about you?

12:03.656 --> 12:06.454
Speaking of romance, you're single,
you're ruggedly handsome.

12:06.625 --> 12:09.093
Did you start up any romances
with ladies in Newport?

12:09.261 --> 12:11.126
I wouldn't know. You know, not really.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.898
Oh, my God, Frank, you're in love.

12:17.336 --> 12:18.598
Love? No.

12:18.771 --> 12:21.035
-I am not.
-Yes, you are. It's all over your face.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.141
Your lips are quivering, cheeks are rosy.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.606
Your cheeks are kind of red.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.506
Well, what the hell?
Frank Atwood!

12:26.679 --> 12:28.146
-How are you, bud?
-I'm good.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.906
-How are you, Bullit?
-Confused.

12:30.082 --> 12:33.574
Thought when you quit the business,
you were gonna hightail it up to Reno.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.416
Yeah, I just stayed a little longer.
Wanted to spend some time with my son.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.150
-What, this is your son?
-Yeah.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.418
Well, that's great.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.655
Here comes the lady. Every 1 0 seconds,
she's in the john, painting her face.

12:45.831 --> 12:48.891
Not that I'm complaining.
A number that hot? I don't ask questions.

12:49.068 --> 12:50.968
Hey, Taylor. Ryan.

12:51.137 --> 12:52.434
Hi.

12:55.574 --> 12:57.474
-Frank.
-Julie.

12:58.010 --> 12:59.739
I thought you were leaving town.

12:59.912 --> 13:03.075
I was. Am, am. I'll be gone soon enough.

13:03.249 --> 13:05.774
Old Frank is third-wheeling
on a date with his son.

13:05.951 --> 13:09.512
-We should get to our table. I'm starving.
-Yeah, and this one can eat.

13:09.688 --> 13:12.623
And if you ask me,
it goes to all the right places.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.316
Gordon, please.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.222
Well, enjoy your dinner.

13:16.395 --> 13:17.692
Goodbye, Frank.

13:17.863 --> 13:19.194
Later.

13:26.005 --> 13:27.370
So should we get that check?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.940
-Oh, my God. Frank.
-Yeah.

13:30.609 --> 13:33.169
-What?
-Are you in love with Julie Cooper?

13:40.953 --> 13:44.821
I mean, your dad and Julie Cooper.
It's just so--

13:44.990 --> 13:46.855
Incestuous, inappropriate.

13:47.026 --> 13:49.256
Well, look at you,
being all hyper-articulate.

13:49.428 --> 13:52.522
-No, I was gonna say it's romantic.
-How is it romantic?

13:52.698 --> 13:55.030
-She's with somebody else.
-Who she doesn't love.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.169
Doesn't mean she should be with my dad.

13:57.336 --> 14:01.204
What if they're meant for each other?
If we could help, they could have a chance.

14:01.373 --> 14:04.900
Taylor, I remember what he was like,
how he treated my mom and us.

14:05.811 --> 14:07.506
Ryan, you have customers.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.372
Hey, Taylor.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.277
Be right there.

14:11.450 --> 14:14.146
I know Julie isn't perfect,
but I also know my dad.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.617
She deserves better.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.620
Exactly.

14:46.952 --> 14:48.078
Say, "Go Trojans."

14:48.254 --> 14:49.551
-Go Trojans.
-Go Trojans.

14:50.089 --> 14:53.058
Oh, so cute. You guys are going
to college together.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.625
Oh, Taryn.
We wish you were coming too.

14:55.794 --> 14:59.389
Well, you know, my dad can't just make
a phone call and get me into USC.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.998
Oh, well, c'est la vie.

15:03.435 --> 15:04.663
Don't listen to her.

15:04.837 --> 15:08.568
I feel I'm gonna be listening to her
snide comments for the rest of my life.

15:08.807 --> 15:11.241
Next year at this time,
we're gonna have a new life.

15:11.477 --> 15:12.705
Without my dad.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.472
Without Taryn. Just us.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.377
Always.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.876
Hey, baby,
reservation for tomorrow night at 7.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.681
-ls that okay?
-Great.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.921
What are you looking at?

15:26.091 --> 15:29.652
Oh, just baby pictures of Seth.
I was feeling very nostalgic.

15:29.828 --> 15:32.353
Oh, who could blame you?
He was a cute kid.

15:32.898 --> 15:34.957
I should get ready. I have a work lunch.

16:00.859 --> 16:04.056
-Dude, it's a psychic.
-I know. Summer says she's not worried.

16:04.229 --> 16:07.426
But I can tell she is, which is why
I dug into the archives...

16:07.599 --> 16:11.330
...and came up with evidence that we are,
in fact, destined to be together.

16:11.503 --> 16:14.199
It's a piece of loose-leaf. Crumpled.

16:14.373 --> 16:18.070
-I dug it out of a trashcan nine years ago.
-Okay, explain that.

16:18.243 --> 16:22.475
This, my friend, marks the first moment
that I fell in love with Summer Roberts.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.843
It was the spring.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.678
-1 998.
-ls this a long flashback?

16:26.852 --> 16:28.843
-My break's almost over.
-Bear with me.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.717
It was the spring. 1 998.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.592
Hey, Luke.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.092
Good news.

16:45.270 --> 16:50.537
Only 1 1 months and six days
until The Matrix comes out.

16:50.709 --> 16:52.199
Eat it, nerd-brain.

16:55.647 --> 17:01.051
We're going to start today
with more readings of your original poems.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.387
Who are we up to?

17:03.555 --> 17:06.387
Summer Roberts. Summer?

17:18.604 --> 17:22.938
I wish I was a mermaid,
And was friends with all the fish.

17:23.108 --> 17:27.204
A shiny tail and seashells,
That would be my wish.

17:30.916 --> 17:34.784
And that is when I knew
Summer Roberts was the one.

17:36.622 --> 17:39.989
Dude, the flashback
did not take that long.

17:42.761 --> 17:45.457
Hi, Julie. Or should I say Mrs. Bullit?

17:45.631 --> 17:48.065
Julie's fine. I'm making smoothies,
you want one?

17:48.233 --> 17:51.566
Yeah, sure. So I haven't really talked to you
since you got engaged.

17:51.737 --> 17:55.036
-Congrats all over the place.
-Thank you, but I'm not exactly engaged.

17:55.207 --> 17:57.437
I'm mulling over Bullit's proposal
for a while.

17:57.609 --> 18:00.077
What's there to mull?
You're in love with him, right?

18:00.245 --> 18:03.146
You probably can't stop daydreaming
about your future together.

18:03.315 --> 18:07.274
And just think, for the rest of your life,
you get to be in a bed with Bullit.

18:07.453 --> 18:09.683
-Suddenly, not in the mood.
-Night after night...

18:09.855 --> 18:12.585
...you and Bullit making love
into the wee hours.

18:12.758 --> 18:16.216
You exploring his body as it gets older
and older, the skin slackening.

18:16.395 --> 18:19.023
-Still having to perform your wifely duties--
-Stop.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.666
Admit it, Julie.
You've got it bad for Frank Atwood.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.825
-What?
-I saw your face last night.

18:24.002 --> 18:26.869
You, Julie Cooper,
have a case of the Franks.

18:29.541 --> 18:31.441
Okay, I do-- I did.

18:31.610 --> 18:35.341
Or one time or another,
may have had a case of the Franks.

18:35.514 --> 18:40.213
But for reasons that are both personal
and complex, I'm staying with Bullit.

18:42.387 --> 18:44.218
Julie, you're different now.

18:44.389 --> 18:47.051
You are no longer the woman
who can marry for money.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.490
-You need more.
-I have a child. I have no job.

18:49.661 --> 18:52.687
I don't own this house.
Besides, I don't think Ryan would approve.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.060
God knows
I've put that kid through enough.

18:55.234 --> 18:57.202
Julie, Ryan's only concern is for you.

18:57.369 --> 19:00.634
He doesn't think
his dad's good enough for you.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.499
Ryan Atwood is worried about me?

19:04.576 --> 19:06.976
-Yeah.
-How about that?

19:11.049 --> 19:13.677
Our answer, right after this break.

19:13.852 --> 19:15.319
Hey, what are you watching?

19:16.121 --> 19:19.022
It's bad. It's really bad.

19:19.191 --> 19:20.886
Look.

19:21.059 --> 19:25.223
Coming up next, could this young woman
be the one to save Newport's sea otters?

19:25.397 --> 19:26.659
-Maybe so.
-You're a hero.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.426
And guess who 's bringing "SexyBack "
to Newport.

19:29.601 --> 19:33.037
That's right. Justin Timberlake
is coming to The Bait Shop.

19:33.205 --> 19:36.538
Just how does such a small venue
get such big names?

19:36.708 --> 19:40.701
Falling skateboards, Justin Timberlake.
Everything the psychic said is coming true.

19:40.879 --> 19:43.848
Any second, I'm gonna get whisked away
by some dude named George.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.450
Relax. I know that psychic
has a lot of credibility.

19:46.618 --> 19:49.951
She works at a kiosk and she doesn't
appear to charge for her services.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.852
But I think I'm a better judge
of whether you and l...

19:53.025 --> 19:56.222
...are destined to be together than her.
And I brought proof.

19:58.630 --> 20:01.656
Happy early Valentine's Day, Summer.

20:06.572 --> 20:10.565
-The mermaid poem.
-That's how I knew, even in fifth grade...

20:11.710 --> 20:14.338
...that you were the one.
It's pretty awesome, huh?

20:14.513 --> 20:15.980
-Oh, my God.
-I know.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.547
No, I didn't write this.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.014
What?

20:22.588 --> 20:23.816
I remember that day.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.058
Okay, Holly, watch this.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.668
Oh, my God, Summer,
you are Scary Spice.

20:39.638 --> 20:41.469
Taylor Townsend alert.

20:42.007 --> 20:44.237
Or more like Taylor Dorksend.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.400
Summer, are you finished
with your poem?

20:46.578 --> 20:49.445
-What poem?
-The original poem we're reading out loud?

20:49.615 --> 20:52.675
We're going in alphabetical order,
and we're on R.

20:52.851 --> 20:54.978
I already finished mine
even though I'm a T.

20:55.153 --> 20:56.984
I may spend my night doing a polish.

20:57.155 --> 20:58.850
Okay.

20:59.591 --> 21:04.585
We're going to start today
with more readings of your original poems.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.289
Who are we up to?

21:07.933 --> 21:11.232
Summer Roberts. Summer?

21:15.207 --> 21:19.644
-Give me your poem.
-Summer, have you no ethics whatsoever?

21:19.811 --> 21:22.609
Okay, you can come
to my birthday party.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.247
Really?

21:25.584 --> 21:26.812
Okay, here.

21:27.586 --> 21:30.384
Summer? We're waiting.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.504
I wish I was a mermaid--

21:49.675 --> 21:52.974
Speak up, Ms. Roberts.

21:53.812 --> 21:57.805
I wish I was a mermaid,
And was friends with all the fish.

21:57.983 --> 22:01.578
A shiny tail and seashells,
That would be my wish.

22:01.753 --> 22:02.981
Lovely.

22:05.891 --> 22:08.985
But this mermaid poem is....

22:09.161 --> 22:11.686
It's our roots. It's our mythology.

22:11.863 --> 22:15.663
What if our mythology is a sham?
Something that we invented?

22:15.834 --> 22:18.132
-What if we are each other's Jimmy Cooper?
-What?

22:18.303 --> 22:22.603
The one before the one. The one you think
is right before you meet your Sandy Cohen?

22:22.774 --> 22:26.335
Wait, are we saying that because Taylor
wrote the poem, she's my Sandy Cohen?

22:26.511 --> 22:29.173
As delicious a twist as that would be,
it's not gonna happen.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.613
No. What I'm saying is
what if we're not destined to be together?

22:35.087 --> 22:37.487
That is your cue, Seth,
to say that I am wrong.

22:38.156 --> 22:41.091
I'm wrong, right?
Cue to say I'm wrong, right?

22:41.259 --> 22:43.056
I don't know anymore.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.096
Julie. We're about to close up.

22:55.273 --> 22:57.605
I just wanted to talk to you.

22:59.344 --> 23:01.676
Look, I know you told Taylor
you were worried...

23:01.847 --> 23:04.077
...about me being involved
with your father.

23:04.249 --> 23:07.184
No, that's okay. It's over,
so no need to talk about it.

23:07.352 --> 23:09.252
Right. It is over between us.

23:09.421 --> 23:10.718
Good. I'm glad.

23:12.224 --> 23:16.092
But, Ryan, I just wanted you
to know...

23:16.261 --> 23:18.752
...that I've been with my fair share
of bad guys.

23:18.930 --> 23:22.923
And for the record,
your dad isn't one of them.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.246
-Hey.
-Hi. So, what's the plan?

23:39.251 --> 23:41.116
The Frank and Julie plan?

23:41.286 --> 23:42.776
-Yup.
-You're onboard.

23:43.321 --> 23:46.222
-I talked to Julie.
-So did l. Lady has a case of the Franks.

23:46.391 --> 23:48.655
But lucky for us,
it's Valentine's Day tomorrow.

23:48.827 --> 23:51.660
-She'll be going out with Bullit.
-We'll get rid of Bullit...

23:51.830 --> 23:54.822
...then get Frank and Julie together
for the most romantic night.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.093
Come over after work.
I'll start making lists.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.760
-All right, I'll see you later.
-Toodles.

24:03.508 --> 24:07.376
-What's up?
-Kaitlin, were you eavesdropping?

24:08.113 --> 24:10.308
Look, my mom loves the Bullit, okay?

24:10.482 --> 24:13.280
He's rich and he's funny,
and it's a total slam dunk.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.444
-Sweetie, it's more complicated than that.
-Not to me.

24:16.621 --> 24:19.317
Listen, Townsend,
I'm playing for Team Bullit, okay?

24:19.491 --> 24:21.959
And my team? We always win.

24:22.394 --> 24:26.296
Well, Ryan and I are playing for Team Frank,
and our team always wins.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.729
That's funny, because you're going down.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.731
-Are you threatening us?
-Totally.

24:30.902 --> 24:32.494
It's war, bitch.

24:36.842 --> 24:38.639
Hi, honey.

24:46.418 --> 24:49.945
Pancakes? When is this Valentine's Day
tradition going to die?

24:50.121 --> 24:53.716
I'm sorry I've been babying you lately.
I'm just feeling a little motherly.

24:53.892 --> 24:56.986
That's okay. I'm feeling a little sulky,
so we're a good match.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.494
Summer's going through something,
isn't she?

24:59.664 --> 25:02.599
She's wondering if I'm her Sandy Cohen
or her Jimmy Cooper.

25:02.767 --> 25:05.895
Well, I hope I didn't worry her.
So how about you, are you okay?

25:06.338 --> 25:09.466
Well, Summer and I have this history,
or at least I thought we did.

25:09.641 --> 25:13.338
Things that happened when we were kids
that convinced me we're meant to be.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.537
If those things
turn out not to be true--

25:15.714 --> 25:17.807
Seth, how long have you dated Summer?

25:17.983 --> 25:20.850
February.... Like, a million years.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.579
And in that time,
how many things has Summer done...

25:23.755 --> 25:26.280
...to convince you
that she's the girl for you?

25:29.494 --> 25:31.792
-A lot.
-So I think you should focus on that.

25:31.963 --> 25:35.364
The real Summer, and not the one
that you worshiped in grade school.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.933
-You know what I think?
-What?

25:37.102 --> 25:40.367
I think that you found your Sandy Cohen.

25:41.673 --> 25:43.504
Me too.

25:46.878 --> 25:50.245
Mom, why did you and Jimmy Cooper
break up anyways?

25:51.783 --> 25:53.341
Doesn't matter.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.532
Sorry I'm late.
Your dad's working me to the bone.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.364
-And not even paying you.
-That's an internship for you.

26:14.539 --> 26:16.439
He'll make it up to me after college...

26:16.608 --> 26:19.270
...when I sign my life away
to the Newport Group.

26:19.844 --> 26:21.744
Jimmy, we need to talk.

26:25.483 --> 26:28.816
I don't know if I can do this anymore.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.649
Do what?

26:31.656 --> 26:32.884
Us.

26:33.825 --> 26:36.089
-I need to end this.
-What are you talking about?

26:36.261 --> 26:38.286
We have a plan.
Go to college, come back.

26:38.463 --> 26:42.832
-Pick up where we left off.
-Jimmy, on paper, all that makes sense.

26:43.234 --> 26:45.896
But in my heart, it just doesn't feel right.

26:46.638 --> 26:48.162
I don't understand.

26:48.340 --> 26:52.572
You don't just wake up one morning
and decide to change your entire life.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.916
Whatever it is,
we'll figure it out together.

27:01.252 --> 27:04.949
It's already been figured out.
I know that I wanna do.

27:05.757 --> 27:07.748
Kirsten, what's going on?

27:17.302 --> 27:19.497
I got into Berkeley.

27:22.507 --> 27:24.304
And you're going?

27:51.369 --> 27:53.963
Don't you see we're supposed
to control our own destiny?

27:55.940 --> 27:59.501
Or else what's the point of life
if it's just something that happens to you?

27:59.678 --> 28:03.011
Summer? You have a visitor.

28:07.285 --> 28:08.513
George.

28:09.554 --> 28:13.354
Hi. I'm Paul. I'm here for GEORGE.

28:13.725 --> 28:14.953
-George?
-Yes.

28:15.126 --> 28:18.425
The Global Environmental Organization
Regarding Greenhouse Emissions.

28:18.596 --> 28:20.689
We've been reading your blog
about sea otters.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.629
I was in the area,
and I'm here to offer you a job.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.339
We'd like you to come work for us.

28:31.309 --> 28:32.936
GEORGE.

28:36.281 --> 28:37.748
It doesn't matter who it is.

28:37.916 --> 28:39.884
All you need to know
is the game's changed.

28:40.051 --> 28:42.611
If you wanna marry Mom,
gonna have to step your game up.

28:42.787 --> 28:47.121
Bullit knows how to romance a lady.
I've been married five times. Check this out.

28:47.859 --> 28:50.555
Emerald earrings for your mom.
Matches her eyes.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.697
Just toss these.
I want something better.

28:52.864 --> 28:55.856
-I want out-of-the-box thinking.
-Hot-air balloon ride.

28:56.534 --> 28:58.866
Hot-air balloon? A blimp?

28:59.337 --> 29:02.534
Oh, heck, squirt. All I care about
is that your mom is happy.

29:02.707 --> 29:05.403
-And if I'm not the man for that--
-No, Bullit, buck up.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.704
-You wanna marry my mom, right?
-Of course.

29:07.879 --> 29:11.440
-And you wanna be my stepdad.
-And play Ping-Pong till I'm gray. Let's go.

29:11.616 --> 29:13.106
Then we need to make a plan.

29:13.284 --> 29:18.347
I want nothing less than the most
spectacular Valentine's date ever.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.087
Is one of those planes yours?

29:25.096 --> 29:26.324
Two of them.

29:26.498 --> 29:29.899
Okay, they're gonna play the money card,
but we can play the emotion card.

29:30.068 --> 29:31.558
-Am I right, Ryan?
-You're right.

29:31.736 --> 29:35.194
Okay, Frank, tell me what it is
that you love about Julie.

29:37.142 --> 29:38.837
Well....

29:39.944 --> 29:41.468
She's....

29:42.647 --> 29:44.239
I forgot what we're dealing with.

29:44.415 --> 29:46.406
-Atwoods on Valentine's Day.
-I told you.

29:46.584 --> 29:50.111
Look, I really appreciate this,
but you guys don't have to do this for me.

29:50.288 --> 29:54.088
-It's not your job.
-No, we want to.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.392
Text from Kaitlin.

29:57.562 --> 30:00.190
"Y'all are going down. Team Bullit."

30:00.365 --> 30:04.324
Frank, if we're gonna win,
you need to give me something here.

30:04.502 --> 30:07.835
Okay, Julie's amazing, all right?

30:08.006 --> 30:09.803
She's pretty.

30:09.974 --> 30:13.273
-She totally gets me?
-Come on, dig deeper here. Look inside.

30:13.444 --> 30:15.639
What is it that connects you to her?

30:17.215 --> 30:19.183
We're just....

30:20.952 --> 30:22.544
From the same world.

30:33.531 --> 30:37.297
-You barely touched your chicken.
-I guess I wasn't in the mood for it.

30:37.468 --> 30:39.663
Well, you're feeling nauseous and tired...

30:39.838 --> 30:42.864
...so I can't expect you
to be dancing on the tables.

30:45.443 --> 30:48.970
If something else is bothering you,
tell me.

30:49.147 --> 30:52.014
-I hate keeping secrets from you.
-I didn't know you were.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.409
Well, there's one thing.

30:54.919 --> 30:58.218
Something that I never told you.

30:58.723 --> 31:00.054
Is this about Jimmy Cooper?

31:00.925 --> 31:03.587
Can we get the check
and talk about this at home?

31:06.130 --> 31:08.690
-Good evening, ma'am.
-Thank you.

31:11.502 --> 31:13.595
Hold up. There's been a change
in schedule.

31:13.771 --> 31:16.239
-What's up?
-We have way cooler plans.

31:16.407 --> 31:19.808
-Your ride should be here any second.
-What is this? What is this shirt?

31:21.145 --> 31:23.579
Nothing. I'm just getting
in the spirit of things.

31:23.748 --> 31:26.046
Last-minute ambush.
Should've seen this coming.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.981
-How'd you find us?
-Taylor activated the GPS on your phone.

31:29.153 --> 31:31.678
-Can I talk to you?
-GPS. I should've thought of that.

31:31.856 --> 31:34.188
-What are you, KGB? What's going on?
-I'll explain.

31:34.359 --> 31:36.122
Whatever he says, don't listen to him.

31:36.294 --> 31:39.695
Look, I know you have plans tonight,
but I was hoping you could cancel.

31:39.864 --> 31:42.025
Oh, you found out about my case
of the Franks.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.430
He's waiting for you.
He knows it's a long shot.

31:44.602 --> 31:46.729
But I said I'd try to get you to meet him.

31:46.905 --> 31:50.636
-I'll drive if you want.
-Mom? Come on, your ride is here.

31:51.542 --> 31:55.308
Tell your dad that in another life,
I'd be there.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.175
I'm sorry.

32:06.291 --> 32:09.954
-I told you, Atwood, my team always wins.
-Guess so.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.897
Wait, what? What the hell?

32:21.839 --> 32:23.568
Driver, could you turn the AC on?

32:23.741 --> 32:25.174
Yeah, sure, Ms. Cooper.

32:34.152 --> 32:37.121
-I cannot believe this.
-That's war, bitch.

32:39.390 --> 32:42.359
God, Ryan, how could you be so mean?

32:42.527 --> 32:44.051
I'm only 1 5.

32:45.229 --> 32:48.630
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know what I was thinking.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.064
Me either. You're going down.

32:51.235 --> 32:53.169
-Kaitlin.
-I'm following your decoy limo.

32:53.338 --> 32:55.363
Oh, but I'm following you.

33:02.947 --> 33:06.110
Did Bullit buy me a hotdog stand?

33:06.551 --> 33:08.542
Driver, I don't think this is right.

33:10.355 --> 33:12.482
-You're here.
-Taylor?

33:23.835 --> 33:25.393
Frank?

33:27.672 --> 33:29.970
I don't know what to say.
What is all this?

33:30.141 --> 33:32.905
Go, say it like we practiced. Go.

33:33.644 --> 33:34.633
Okay.

33:35.913 --> 33:40.043
This is sort of a testament
to where we came from.

33:40.218 --> 33:45.212
But I really want tonight
to be about where we could go.

33:51.929 --> 33:55.330
It's just a promise ring.
I know it's not fancy.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.901
I wish I could offer you more,
but this is all I have.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.804
And that is that I love you.

34:02.807 --> 34:04.536
The real you.

34:09.679 --> 34:12.045
-Frank--
-Mom.

34:12.216 --> 34:13.739
Bullit's waiting.

34:17.655 --> 34:18.882
Frank, I'm sorry.

34:22.927 --> 34:24.326
I have one daughter left.

34:25.163 --> 34:27.255
And she loves Bullit.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.924
Even if I don't.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.233
I'm sorry, Frank.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.589
After we had Seth
and were trying for a second...

34:55.760 --> 34:58.695
...and nothing was happening,
I thought it was karmic payback.

34:58.863 --> 35:02.594
Now you know it doesn't work like that.
Why didn't you ever say anything?

35:02.767 --> 35:05.201
Part of it was timing.
It had only been a month.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.798
But then, the best thing in the world
happened to me.

35:13.177 --> 35:14.838
Hey, thanks.

35:15.012 --> 35:16.445
Okay, thanks.

35:23.821 --> 35:25.379
Mondale and Ferraro.

35:25.857 --> 35:27.825
Mondale and Ferraro, path to equality.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.658
-No, thanks.
-What are you, a Republican?

35:32.196 --> 35:36.155
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you catch it
from your parents? I hear it's hereditary.

35:36.334 --> 35:38.393
I guess I did.

35:41.672 --> 35:44.869
Well, if you don't want a pamphlet,
here, have a pin, on me.

35:52.416 --> 35:55.510
I might wear it,
but only because it's stylish.

35:55.953 --> 35:59.411
You know, if you're not a pamphlet reader,
I could take you to coffee.

36:01.259 --> 36:04.422
Tell you all about
why Mondale and Ferraro are gonna lose.

36:05.463 --> 36:08.023
If you're so sure they're gonna lose,
why bother?

36:08.499 --> 36:11.195
I don't know. It feels right.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.371
So coffee?

36:19.510 --> 36:23.970
I guess I had fate on my mind
when I got you this gift.

36:26.250 --> 36:29.447
-Where on earth did you find this?
-I turned the house upside down.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.885
If it hadn't been for Mondale,
there never would have been a Seth.

36:33.057 --> 36:34.319
There wouldn't be a Ryan.

36:34.492 --> 36:37.461
And whoever this is gonna be.

36:37.628 --> 36:39.220
All because of that one day.

36:39.964 --> 36:41.295
My lucky day.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.095
My lucky day.

36:52.910 --> 36:56.846
Okay, I admit it.
I put way too much stock into that poem.

36:57.014 --> 37:01.417
-But I'm not the girl you thought I was.
-You're not. You, Summer, are better.

37:03.454 --> 37:06.912
Back then, you were just this fantasy.
You were this little girl who...

37:07.091 --> 37:09.491
...when I would see,
you would either ignore me...

37:09.660 --> 37:12.254
...or make an obscene gesture
and keep on walking.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.898
-Yeah, I remember that. Sorry.
-But now look at you.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.830
You fight for sea otters,
you've befriended Taylor Townsend.

37:18.002 --> 37:20.493
You're an incredible mom to that bunny.

37:20.671 --> 37:22.901
-I guess I have changed.
-You've evolved.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.907
And over the last 950 days
we've been dating.

37:26.077 --> 37:29.342
And yes, I've counted, and yes,
I counted the Zach era...

37:29.513 --> 37:31.606
...because, really, who were we kidding?

37:31.782 --> 37:34.250
I've watched you grow
into this incredible woman.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.419
And that is who I love.

37:39.857 --> 37:41.347
Thanks, Cohen.

37:47.031 --> 37:48.362
What's wrong?

37:50.034 --> 37:51.626
-I met GEORGE.
-I'll kill him.

37:51.802 --> 37:53.997
This guy came by from GEORGE
to recruit me.

37:54.171 --> 37:57.072
He heard about my work
and invited me to travel the country...

37:57.241 --> 37:59.801
...and talk to college kids
about voting next November.

37:59.977 --> 38:01.308
But what about Brown?

38:01.812 --> 38:04.645
I'd have to defer a year. Live on a bus.

38:05.249 --> 38:06.773
Sounds like a great gig.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.784
I don't know
that we could see each other.

38:12.423 --> 38:16.655
So you have to choose
between me and GEORGE.

38:16.827 --> 38:19.387
That's the thing.
I don't know that I have to.

38:19.563 --> 38:22.657
I do believe that you are my destiny.
I do, Seth.

38:22.833 --> 38:25.461
But I just don't know
that you're my only destiny.

38:28.205 --> 38:29.570
Here.

38:29.740 --> 38:31.401
Happy Valentine's Day.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.806
I picked couples through time.

38:41.519 --> 38:43.646
Well, where are we?

38:43.821 --> 38:46.619
I was hoping that someday
we could go in the middle.

39:00.738 --> 39:05.300
So can I tell you what Bullit's surprise is?
I can't hold it any longer.

39:05.943 --> 39:08.605
-Sure.
-His plane is sitting on the tarmac...

39:08.779 --> 39:12.545
...gassed up and ready to take you
anywhere in the world.

39:13.384 --> 39:16.717
You're gonna be spending Valentine's Day
anywhere that you wanna go.

39:16.887 --> 39:19.549
I mean, that's pretty amazing.

39:20.524 --> 39:24.290
Yeah. Yeah, it really is.

39:29.133 --> 39:32.432
Oh, no. Mom....

40:04.902 --> 40:08.099
Squirt, where the heck's your mom?

40:09.340 --> 40:13.834
I know I asked you to be my stepdad,
but do you mind being my friend instead?

40:17.148 --> 40:20.914
So Julie's had enough
of the old Bullit, eh?

40:23.020 --> 40:24.988
We can still play Ping-Pong together.

40:33.731 --> 40:35.028
Come on.

40:35.633 --> 40:37.430
-You know I let you win.
-No, you don't.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.728
-Yes, I do.
-ln your dreams.

40:39.904 --> 40:41.565
You ever see that movie, Casablanca?

40:41.739 --> 40:43.730
-No.
-lt goes like this:

40:43.908 --> 40:47.639
Peanut, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

40:47.812 --> 40:50.474
Oh, come on, luck be a lady,
luck be a lady....

40:51.415 --> 40:53.280
-I can't believe I didn't win.
-Shocking.

40:53.451 --> 40:57.012
Well, if it's any consolation, though,
this soft serve is outstanding.

40:57.188 --> 40:58.416
Would anyone like seconds?

40:58.589 --> 41:00.489
-Yeah, I would.
-Yeah, me too.

41:00.658 --> 41:02.319
Thank you.

41:06.330 --> 41:09.322
Sorry things didn't work out
with you and Julie.

41:12.303 --> 41:13.736
Hey.

41:14.104 --> 41:16.572
I'm sitting here sharing ice cream
with my kid.

41:16.740 --> 41:19.038
It's been a long time since I've done that.

41:31.755 --> 41:33.518
Tell me that's her.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.594
That's her.

41:40.197 --> 41:41.528
I'm suddenly nervous.

41:41.699 --> 41:43.428
You're gonna be great.

41:53.911 --> 41:56.209
I'm having the strangest craving
for a corndog.

41:57.781 --> 41:59.510
There may be one left.

42:02.253 --> 42:03.914
Seat?

42:10.694 --> 42:14.687
How about that? Fourth quarter,
Team Frank comes through in the clutch.

42:14.865 --> 42:16.230
Oh, yeah.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.062
True love on Valentine's Day.
What more could you ask for?

42:19.236 --> 42:20.498
Yeah.

42:21.672 --> 42:25.267
Hey, so, you know, we reserved the limo
for another two hours.

42:25.442 --> 42:27.637
What do you say we drive down
to the beach?

42:31.148 --> 42:33.343
I don't know.

42:33.517 --> 42:35.144

42:37.821 --> 42:40.119

42:40.991 --> 42:43.585

42:44.261 --> 42:45.728
-I have newfound faith.
-I agree.

42:45.896 --> 42:47.124
Okay.

42:55.606 --> 42:56.834
