It was about Barbie.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.087
What are you talking about?

34:57.887 --> 35:00.094
It was the military.
They know he's in here.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.556
Tell me exactly what they said.

35:05.020 --> 35:09.184
They said that he's the one.
The one that they've been looking for.

35:10.817 --> 35:11.852
Turn it on.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.360
ThiS iS Jim Rennie.

35:17.157 --> 35:21.025
I'm sorry to report that this has been
a very dark day in Chester's Mill.

35:21.202 --> 35:24.035
I need all citizens to be aware
and vigilant.

35:24.205 --> 35:28.539
Today, Maxine Seagrave and
her business associate Otto Aguilar

35:28.710 --> 35:32.043
were murdered,
shot execution style.

35:32.213 --> 35:34.295
Many of you may have known Max.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.337
She was a reputable businesswoman
from Westlake.

35:38.511 --> 35:42.675
In addition, an attempt was made
on the life of Julia Shumway.

35:42.849 --> 35:46.387
She suffered a gunshot to the chest
and may not survive.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.552
There was also an attempt made
on my own life.

35:48.730 --> 35:51.221
One person is responsible
for all this.

35:51.900 --> 35:55.358
Dale "Barbie" Barbara.

35:55.904 --> 35:58.065
A warrant has been issued
for his arrest.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.945
He ’3 been charged
with the attempted murders

36:00.116 --> 36:01.401
of Mrs. Shumway and myself.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.739
He's also been charged
with the murders of Max Seagrave,

36:04.913 --> 36:09.623
Otto Aguilar and
MS. Seagrave'S mother, Agatha.

36:09.793 --> 36:11.784
Barbie is on the run.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.043
He is armed and dangerous
and for those reasons,

36:14.214 --> 36:16.580
I am declaring
a state of emergency.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.624
ThiS senseless violence
will not be tolerated.

36:19.803 --> 36:23.921
What Barbie did is not who we are.
Even now. Especially now.

36:24.307 --> 36:28.767
When Barbie is taken into custody,
he'll be given a fair trial.

36:28.937 --> 36:34.227
The government, the people,
will seek the death penalty.

36:37.821 --> 36:41.313
Any bets on what will happen
when the four of uS touch it?

36:41.491 --> 36:43.527
All I want iS answers.

36:43.702 --> 36:48.787
Not a seizure or riddle.
Just answers.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.164
All right.

36:57.382 --> 37:01.546
Whatever happens, don't let go.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.512
Dad?

38:22.717 --> 38:24.378
Dad?

38:36.689 --> 38:38.475
Junior.

38:47.617 --> 38:49.107
No!

38:54.582 --> 38:55.867
Dad!

38:58.837 --> 39:00.247
I gotta go find my dad.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.081
Wait!

39:06.135 --> 39:07.966
Did we all see the same thing?

39:08.137 --> 39:10.514
- Big Jim?
- Yeah.

39:11.099 --> 39:14.057
What the hell was that? I thought
we were coming here for answers.

39:14.227 --> 39:18.095
We were, Joe. I think that was it.

39:18.481 --> 39:22.474
- What was it?
- Maybe the dome's coming down.

39:23.278 --> 39:26.896
First Big Jim haS to die.

39:29.409 --> 39:31.320
And I think we're supposed to do it.
