And then I realized,
that's why they call it a clock radio.

00:07.774 --> 00:10.800
'Cause it's got both.

00:10.877 --> 00:13.277
Hey, Donna.
Feast your eyes. All new stuff...

00:13.346 --> 00:16.076
for me and Joanne's weekend
away at tennis camp.

00:16.149 --> 00:20.017
BillieJean King's sister is leading
the campfire songs.

00:20.086 --> 00:22.213
We're gonna make quite the racket.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.582
Good one, Bob.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.924
Bob's goin' out of town
for the weekend?

00:29.996 --> 00:31.964
All right!
Party at Donna's!

00:32.031 --> 00:34.227
Okay. We're gonna need
beer, balloons...

00:34.300 --> 00:37.098
and girls with low self-esteem.

00:37.170 --> 00:41.573
Guys, hang on. Donna and I already
made plans this weekend.

00:41.641 --> 00:44.701
Well, then just leave us a key, man.
And don't worry. If anything bad happens...

00:44.778 --> 00:47.178
I know how to make it look
like a robbery-homicide.

00:48.348 --> 00:50.282
Look, Eric and I want
one weekend alone...

00:50.350 --> 00:52.875
where we don't have to be so secret
about being engaged.

00:52.952 --> 00:55.318
I could even wear my ring
if it weren't being resized for me.

00:55.388 --> 00:59.085
Can they make a ring big enough to fit
your Paul Bunyan hands?

01:00.860 --> 01:02.919
- Jackie?
- Well, I'm sorry, Donna...

01:02.996 --> 01:05.396
but if you're not gonna have a party,
you're gonna get insulted.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.399
It's just the way it is.

01:07.467 --> 01:11.130
The way I see it, unless Donna's blockin'
the door with her giant hands...

01:13.073 --> 01:15.507
- we're comin' over for a party.
- Oh-Oh!

01:15.575 --> 01:18.009
We should get one of those girls
that jump out of cakes.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.808
Yeah. They're great.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.110
You know, you two could do
a little less standin' around...

01:23.183 --> 01:25.174
and a little more
jumpin' out of cakes.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.654
Morning.

01:29.722 --> 01:32.919
Hey, Dad, I was thinking of spending
tonight and tomorrow over at Fez's.

01:32.992 --> 01:35.620
At whose's?

01:35.695 --> 01:37.629
The foreign boy
with the tight pants...

01:37.697 --> 01:39.892
wears a little too much cologne.

01:42.302 --> 01:47.239
I don't like him.
I caught him stealin' bacon out of our fridge.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.869
Why are you doing your homework
in the morning?

01:51.945 --> 01:54.209
Uh, I was out last night with Donna.

01:54.280 --> 01:58.546
Well, of course you were. That's why you
came in a half hour past the curfew.

01:58.618 --> 02:02.486
Oh, well, Donna had a flat.

02:02.555 --> 02:06.150
Ohh!
That's awful bad luck.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.626
Seein' how Donna doesn't have a car.

02:10.597 --> 02:13.395
I see you getting bigger...

02:13.466 --> 02:15.798
but you still act
like a 12-year-old.

02:15.869 --> 02:19.669
Now, when are you gonna grow up
and start thinkin' about your future?

02:19.739 --> 02:22.731
Red, don't get upset so early.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.676
You won't enjoy
your sausage and Tang.

02:25.745 --> 02:29.806
Sausage and Tang?
Is-

02:29.883 --> 02:32.113
Is that a little racy for breakfast?

02:36.823 --> 02:38.757
I don't get it.

02:38.825 --> 02:42.022
Well, I'm gonna leave
before someone explains it.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.326
Good morning.

02:48.401 --> 02:51.495
Steven.
You got a big tear in that jacket.

02:51.571 --> 02:55.371
Yeah. It's hard hoppin'
over a fence carrying two 12 packs.

02:58.611 --> 03:01.341
I mean, library books.

03:01.414 --> 03:05.441
Well, I'm gonna ignore that, 'cause you
don't even have parents to buy you a new coat.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.043
He doesn't have parents, Eric.

03:09.789 --> 03:13.384
He told me that sometimes
when he's all alone, he cries.

03:15.361 --> 03:19.229
Oh, that settles it.
I'm taking you shopping for a new coat.

03:24.637 --> 03:26.605
Here, here.
Take some Tang and go.

03:28.474 --> 03:31.500
Man, if I had a dollar for every time
I heard a chick say that.

03:31.578 --> 03:33.512
[Laughs]

03:35.248 --> 03:39.241
What? What? Never turn down Tang.
Growing boys need Tang.

04:47.387 --> 04:49.321
I brought the Slip 'n Slide.

Okay.
I'll get the hose.

No, we don't need
the hose, man.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.351
We'll just use beer.

04:56.429 --> 05:00.195
- Kelso, are you nuts?
- You're right.

05:00.266 --> 05:02.530
We don't wanna waste the beer.
Go get the hose, man.

05:02.602 --> 05:04.536
No! Guys, we said, no party.

05:04.604 --> 05:07.596
Oh, come on, Forman. Look, man,
you gotta help me out here.

05:07.674 --> 05:10.142
Jackie and I are going
through a really rough time...

05:10.209 --> 05:12.541
and maybe, just maybe,
we can start to heal...

05:12.612 --> 05:16.309
if you can find it in your heart to
let me trash your girlfriend's house!

05:16.382 --> 05:18.043
Don't care.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.051
But it's party time, man.

05:20.119 --> 05:23.987
I invited a girl in a halter top
who was on her fifth beer.

05:24.057 --> 05:28.221
- Fifth beer! Halter top!
- Forget it, Kelso.

05:28.294 --> 05:31.991
But do you know what a Slip 'n Slide
can do to a halter top?

05:32.065 --> 05:35.296
It turns it into a belt.

No, I'm sorry. You just missed him.
Can I take a message?

05:46.312 --> 05:49.110
Yes. This is, uh, Fenton
from All That Glitters.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.174
Um, Mr. Forman bought a ring here,
and I'm calling to tell him it's ready.

05:52.251 --> 05:55.948
And, ah, oh, it looks fabulous.

05:57.890 --> 06:01.587
He bought me a ring?

Oh, uh-
[Clears Throat] I, uh-

06:03.663 --> 06:07.497
I hope it wasn't a surprise.
Perhaps you shouldn't know that I called. Um-

Uh, could you let Mr. Forman
know that I called. I mean, um-

Okay.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.550
Okay, dinner is all ready.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.145
I just had to add
the secret ingredient-

06:30.223 --> 06:33.158
love.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.195
- By the way, "love" is salt.
- [Chuckles]

06:36.262 --> 06:39.060
All right.
Chicken Pinciotti for two.

06:44.003 --> 06:47.996
Um, is this red stuff
gravy or blood?

06:48.074 --> 06:50.372
There's no gravy.

06:51.577 --> 06:55.536
Oh. Well, I guess
it's just kinda moist then.

06:57.650 --> 07:00.175
Actually, it's kinda pink.
Is this ham?

07:00.253 --> 07:02.847
No, it's Chicken Pinciotti.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.720
Mine looks fine.
Well, if you don't wanna eat yours...

07:05.792 --> 07:07.987
we have some Fruity Pebbles.

07:08.060 --> 07:13.396
No- No. Grown-ups don't eat Fruity Pebbles.
They eat chicken.

What grown-ups?

07:16.135 --> 07:18.160
Where are these grown-ups?

07:18.237 --> 07:20.569
Donna, us.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.302
The whole point of this weekend
is to prove that we're grown up...

07:23.376 --> 07:26.209
and that Red doesn't know what he's
talking about when he says I'm immature.

07:26.279 --> 07:30.045
It is? I don't know.
I thought the point of this weekend...

07:30.116 --> 07:32.676
was to have, you know,
a fun, light weekend.

07:32.752 --> 07:36.381
Yeah. No, it will be fun and light.
It's just that in the next 36 hours...

07:36.456 --> 07:39.983
I would like to prove to myself that my father's
been wrong about me my entire life.

07:40.059 --> 07:42.892
But in a fun, light way.

07:42.962 --> 07:46.557
- Well, whatever. You don't have to eat the chicken.
- No! What? No.

It's like, I make fun of your cooking, you tell
me to put on pants when we have company.

Are you gonna stop wearing your pants?
'Cause I might have a problem with that.

Oh, nonsense.

look at that ring...

09:06.679 --> 09:09.648
you called Mr. Forman about
that he doesn't know I know about yet.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.912
Oh. I don't think I'm supposed
to show you, but-

09:12.985 --> 09:16.113
but I do a lot of things behind this counter
I'm not supposed to do.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.782
So, hmm.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.487
This is an engagement ring.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.555
An engagement ring?
Uh-oh.

09:29.535 --> 09:32.527
Why would Red give me
a diamond ring?

09:34.073 --> 09:36.007
Maybe it's a menopause diamond.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.913
You know, for a happy menopause.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.582
Oh, oh, it's engraved.

Well, we could make out
on the couch...

11:43.535 --> 11:46.868

we should just fight and go to bed.

Well, this is something that grown-ups
do in the same house.

like a normal person...

13:18.630 --> 13:23.499
he has stashed some highly
offensive photographic material.

13:23.569 --> 13:26.299
Well, this has gotta stop.

13:26.371 --> 13:29.238
Eric should have told me about
his engagement, because in this house...

13:29.308 --> 13:31.367
we do not keep secrets.

13:33.545 --> 13:36.742
What are you talkin' about?

13:36.815 --> 13:40.182
Cheesecake.
Different types of cheesecake.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.812
Oh.
Sorry I missed it.

13:47.593 --> 13:49.788
Don't judge me.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.058
Kelso, I need to use your bathroom.

13:57.135 --> 13:59.365
Nope.
There's nobody here.

13:59.438 --> 14:02.066
Of course, I can't see people who don't
have parties for their friends.

14:02.140 --> 14:06.873
So maybe there is somebody here,
and I just can't see 'em. I can't see you, Eric!

14:06.945 --> 14:10.073
Kelso, I really need
to use the bathroom.

14:10.148 --> 14:12.082
Well, maybe you should have
thought of that...

14:12.150 --> 14:14.414
before you kicked us out of Donna's house,
you party pooper.

14:14.486 --> 14:18.013
- Yeah.
- No party, no pooper!

14:18.090 --> 14:21.025
- Nice.
- Yeah, it really was. No party, no pooper!

14:28.367 --> 14:31.564
So then I said,
"No party, no pooper!"

14:31.637 --> 14:33.662
Because he wouldn't have a party.

14:35.073 --> 14:37.064
See, I think it's stupid
that Eric and Donna...

14:37.142 --> 14:39.201
need to practice being married.

14:39.278 --> 14:43.339
I mean, it's simple. The woman just
needs to be a cook in the kitchen...

14:43.415 --> 14:47.749
a maid in the living room,
and an acrobat in the bedroom.

14:47.819 --> 14:50.310
And I can hire a cook and a maid.

14:52.424 --> 14:54.688
I am liking you more and more.

14:56.628 --> 14:59.495
You know, I was thinkin'
about <i>The Incred/ble Hulk.</i>

14:59.564 --> 15:01.498
I like that show.

15:01.566 --> 15:04.433
Especially the part where he gets all,
like, mad and turns green...

15:04.503 --> 15:06.437
and then his shirt rips off.

15:06.505 --> 15:10.908
But then I was thinkin',
like what if he was purple?

15:10.976 --> 15:12.910
And a lady?

15:12.978 --> 15:16.573
Come on. Like an angry,
naked purple chick.

15:16.648 --> 15:19.640
That's better, right?

15:19.718 --> 15:21.743
<i>[Red]</i>
<i>What's go/n'on down here?</i>

15:23.188 --> 15:25.053
<i>Why doesn't anybody ever go home?</i>

15:27.259 --> 15:31.662
And then I realized, that's why
they call it a clock radio.

15:31.730 --> 15:34.858
[All]
Cause it's got both!

15:34.933 --> 15:38.061
What are you doin' here?
I thought Eric was with you.

15:39.204 --> 15:41.263
Eric is always with me...

15:41.340 --> 15:43.274
in spirit.

15:44.409 --> 15:46.468
Don't pussyfoot around.

15:46.545 --> 15:51.312
I make three phone calls,
you're back on that raft you floated in on.

15:54.953 --> 15:57.148
- Eric is at Donna's.
- Fez!

15:57.222 --> 15:59.850
I fear the open sea.

16:06.031 --> 16:09.000
Kitty. You know what I
just found out about Eric?

16:09.067 --> 16:10.762
You found out?

16:10.836 --> 16:14.636
He lied to us.
He's spending the night at Donna's.

16:14.706 --> 16:17.038
Oh!

16:17.109 --> 16:19.304
What did you think it was?

16:19.378 --> 16:23.508
He has dirty magazines
in his closet.

16:23.582 --> 16:26.676
Our son is a pervert.
I'm just gonna go pray for him.

16:34.626 --> 16:37.561
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

16:37.629 --> 16:40.325
Well, speak of the idiot.

16:43.034 --> 16:46.333
- I gotta use the bathroom.
- What's a matter with the foreign kid's bathroom?

16:46.405 --> 16:48.339
That is where you were, isn't it?

16:48.407 --> 16:52.309
Yeah, of course. Wh-Why would I lie
to you about something like that?

16:52.377 --> 16:54.538
I need bacon.

16:57.549 --> 17:00.109
Okay, uh, the reason
I'd lie about something like that is-

17:00.185 --> 17:03.086
What happened? You piss Donna off,
and she locked you out?

17:03.155 --> 17:05.646
- Donna? No.
- Oh.

17:05.723 --> 17:09.490
Well, you pissed me off,
so I'm lockin' you out.

17:10.561 --> 17:12.757
- Did you find-
- Don't stop loving me!

17:31.416 --> 17:34.579
Well, look who's here.

17:34.653 --> 17:38.589
Oh, say, Eric.
The morning paper didn't come.

17:38.657 --> 17:42.024
So I thought that you
could tell me a story while I eat.

17:44.563 --> 17:48.363
I know how good you are
at making up stories.

17:48.433 --> 17:51.368
Why don't you tell me things?

17:51.436 --> 17:54.496
You can tell me things,
even bad things.

17:54.573 --> 17:58.304
A mother's love is like
a flower that never wilts.

17:59.711 --> 18:02.703
Unless it's lied to.

18:02.781 --> 18:07.309
If you're done reciting poetry,
I'd like to yell at the kid.

18:07.385 --> 18:10.115
Hey, Forman,
this is about to get ugly.

18:10.188 --> 18:12.622
So if you have to go potty,
now's a good time.

18:15.260 --> 18:19.196
I'm sorry. Okay, I shouldn't have
told you I was at Fez's.

18:19.264 --> 18:23.860
[Exhales] Do you ever think about
what you're doing with your life?

18:23.935 --> 18:28.702
Hey, Dad. It's my life, okay?
I'm grown up now.

18:28.773 --> 18:30.707
Grown up?

18:30.775 --> 18:35.235
Well, you sure say that a lot,
so it must be true. Let me try it.

18:35.313 --> 18:39.340
Hey, everybody.
I'm Mr. Rogers.

18:44.122 --> 18:48.525
But wait, I'm not wearing a sweater.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.891
And I'm about to kick your ass.

18:58.169 --> 19:00.694
Maybe it doesn't work.

19:00.772 --> 19:04.868
Maybe you're just an immature pissant
who still lies to his parents.

19:04.943 --> 19:07.002
You know what, Dad?

19:09.781 --> 19:12.716
Oh, my God. You're right.
Y- I have been lying...

19:12.784 --> 19:15.378
and acting immature,
and keeping secrets.

19:15.453 --> 19:17.648
And I swear to God,
I'm just as sick of it as you are.

19:17.722 --> 19:20.691
So, here's the truth.
Donna and I are engaged.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.595
I get his room.

19:33.138 --> 19:36.539
- You're engaged?
- Yeah.

19:36.608 --> 19:40.738
- I already gave her the ring.
- Kitty, are you hearing this?

19:40.812 --> 19:42.803
Yes, I am.

19:44.816 --> 19:47.546
And for the first time too.

19:53.925 --> 19:56.393
Well, it's true.

19:56.461 --> 20:01.125
So, if I'm gonna be ready
to be married, which I am...

20:01.199 --> 20:05.568
then I guess I should be ready
to tell you the truth.

20:05.637 --> 20:07.628
So, there it is.

20:09.441 --> 20:12.842
Wow. That felt great.
[Chuckles]

20:15.847 --> 20:18.714
I'm gonna go see my fiancé.
Wow, that felt great too.

20:20.752 --> 20:22.686
What a great day!

20:27.425 --> 20:30.292
Okay.
Okay, this is good.

20:31.363 --> 20:34.560
We're all being open here.

20:34.633 --> 20:38.091
Does anybody have anything else
they wanna get off their chest?

20:43.041 --> 20:45.839
Mrs. Forman, I hate my jacket.

20:51.249 --> 20:54.650
Oh, well, now we're just
trying to hurt each other.

21:01.126 --> 21:03.720
Okay, now.
Come on, Steven.

21:03.795 --> 21:07.060
Give it another chance.
Oh, it's snazzy!

21:08.466 --> 21:12.527
Hey, there. Hi, there.
Check out my outerwear.

21:16.741 --> 21:19.801
I'll just give this to Goodwill.

21:19.878 --> 21:23.075
And read the arm- "stuntman."

21:23.148 --> 21:25.946
People are gonna think
I'm from Hollywood.

21:29.554 --> 21:31.021
