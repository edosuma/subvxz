WEBVTT

00:00.735 --> 00:01.807
My brothers and I

00:01.838 --> 00:03.652
are the first vampires in history...

00:03.660 --> 00:04.974
The Originals.

00:05.514 --> 00:08.290
300 years ago, we called New Orleans home.

00:08.548 --> 00:10.020
I was happy here...

00:11.641 --> 00:12.881
for a time.

00:13.833 --> 00:15.096
Now we've returned,

00:15.188 --> 00:16.596
only to find a miracle...

00:16.643 --> 00:19.181
Niklaus, the girl is carrying your child.

00:19.223 --> 00:21.234
And with it, a new responsibility...

00:21.235 --> 00:23.069
I will always protect you.

00:23.070 --> 00:24.385
You have my word on that.

00:24.416 --> 00:26.284
But our family has many enemies.

00:26.300 --> 00:28.451
Klaus destroyed everything good in my life.

00:28.471 --> 00:30.538
So I'm gonna take away
the thing he wants most.

00:30.539 --> 00:32.729
These threats should have united us.

00:33.073 --> 00:35.255
Instead, Klaus has driven us apart.

00:35.310 --> 00:37.422
Why should I help you after
what you did to Elijah?

00:37.429 --> 00:38.939
You're my family.

00:38.986 --> 00:41.442
Klaus will never stop
trying to control you.

00:41.562 --> 00:42.576
What do you want?

00:42.615 --> 00:44.445
My brother expects my loyalty,

00:44.446 --> 00:45.978
as he has for 1,000 years,

00:46.025 --> 00:48.770
but now, perhaps, it's time
to make a different choice.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:58.061 --> 01:00.117
I should never have come back here.

01:00.947 --> 01:02.965
This is the town where I fell in love

01:03.419 --> 01:05.929
and where love failed us.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.577
I assume you know who I'm talking about.

01:09.578 --> 01:11.667
You should know, Marcel and I aren't on the

01:11.787 --> 01:13.512
best of terms right now.

01:14.219 --> 01:16.729
But you are an active priest, are you not,

01:16.849 --> 01:18.880
ready and able to hear my confession?

01:19.115 --> 01:21.195
Usually, the word "willing"

01:21.234 --> 01:23.463
falls somewhere in that sentence.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.278
Are you even Catholic?

01:26.075 --> 01:28.051
I've been on this earth for 1,000 years.

01:28.094 --> 01:29.548
I can't say for certain that I believe

01:29.548 --> 01:31.543
in anything like a God, but

01:32.207 --> 01:33.811
I need absolution

01:34.468 --> 01:36.015
from someone,

01:36.469 --> 01:37.853
anyone.

01:39.722 --> 01:42.324
So will you hear my confession or not?

01:46.566 --> 01:49.772
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:50.226 --> 01:51.907
I am a liar,

01:52.768 --> 01:54.371
a betrayer.

01:55.195 --> 01:58.007
I have conspired against my own blood,

01:59.463 --> 02:02.277
and I doubt even your God could save me.

02:18.787 --> 02:21.571
Have you spoken to our
good friend Marcel today?

02:21.572 --> 02:22.893
No. Should I have?

02:22.908 --> 02:24.770
Well, he's been mysteriously silent,

02:24.817 --> 02:26.834
avoiding me, some might say.

02:27.307 --> 02:29.251
I thought, perhaps, he may have whispered

02:29.274 --> 02:31.238
reasons into your ear

02:31.512 --> 02:33.882
along with all of those sweet nothings.

02:33.882 --> 02:35.438
If I see him, I'll be sure to ask

02:35.476 --> 02:37.823
if he's still sore at you.

02:39.512 --> 02:42.312
Let me give a voice to
that look in your eyes.

02:42.313 --> 02:44.283
"My saintly, noble brother

02:44.403 --> 02:46.527
lies writhing in agony in the bayou,

02:46.559 --> 02:48.948
victim of my bastard brother's bite

02:48.949 --> 02:50.995
when just one or two drops

02:51.009 --> 02:53.330
of his blood would ease his pain."

02:53.450 --> 02:54.560
One the contrary, Nik.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.280
I am simply enjoying my brekkie

02:56.327 --> 02:57.861
waiting for Elijah's healthy return.

02:57.884 --> 02:59.135
Oh, come on, Rebekah.

02:59.159 --> 03:01.450
You've been giving me the
devil's eye all morning.

03:01.486 --> 03:02.576
Out with it.

03:02.696 --> 03:04.391
Perhaps I'm concerned

03:04.406 --> 03:05.666
that if I voice my opinion

03:05.689 --> 03:07.034
about what you did to Elijah,

03:07.066 --> 03:09.537
I will end up on the wrong
side of your toxic hybrid teeth.

03:10.608 --> 03:13.174
Poppycock. I would never bite you.

03:13.714 --> 03:16.052
Elijah made some very offensive accusations

03:16.083 --> 03:18.005
about my intentions towards my child.

03:18.046 --> 03:20.572
He deserves a day or two of discomfort.

03:21.879 --> 03:24.608
Besides, you know my preferred method

03:24.663 --> 03:26.657
of punishment for your indiscretions

03:26.673 --> 03:28.296
is the dagger.

03:35.865 --> 03:38.678
There's something
fundamentally wrong with you.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.370
Here. Drink this.

03:58.131 --> 04:00.265
Forgive me, please.

04:00.321 --> 04:02.104
It's ok.

04:03.856 --> 04:06.815
Remind me to annihilate your
brother once you're healthy.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.812
Yes. Remind me to remind
you to get in line.

04:10.269 --> 04:12.740
Doesn't help that we decided to shack up

04:12.771 --> 04:15.213
in the middle of a swamp, either.

04:20.942 --> 04:22.432
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine.

04:22.469 --> 04:24.058
Please just...

04:24.878 --> 04:26.197
return to your reading.

04:26.317 --> 04:29.108
Well, I went through
the whole thing. It's...

04:29.352 --> 04:31.117
just a regular Bible

04:31.992 --> 04:34.170
with an entry in the family tree

04:34.176 --> 04:35.846
that may or may not be me,

04:35.854 --> 04:37.241
but you know I've been a little busy

04:37.273 --> 04:38.411
worrying about you.

04:38.468 --> 04:39.663
Hayley, please.

04:39.725 --> 04:41.345
This fever will make me unstable.

04:41.358 --> 04:42.984
Now, once these hallucinations begin,

04:42.997 --> 04:45.155
I'll start to see things.

04:45.358 --> 04:47.132
I will start to say things.

04:47.158 --> 04:48.609
You must leave me here.

04:48.729 --> 04:50.411
I'm not leaving you like this.

05:23.150 --> 05:24.626
All right. I'm here.

05:25.039 --> 05:26.353
Let's do this.

05:28.624 --> 05:30.501
I'll keep this simple.

05:31.124 --> 05:33.224
This kid is an old enemy

05:33.225 --> 05:34.562
of your favorite person Klaus.

05:34.682 --> 05:36.307
Now, he's got plenty to say

05:36.427 --> 05:37.603
about what that traitorous

05:37.634 --> 05:39.836
son of a bitch has been
up to behind my back.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.307
Now, for those of you faint of heart,

05:43.477 --> 05:44.897
there's the door

05:45.967 --> 05:47.588
because those who stick around,

05:47.708 --> 05:49.665
you're signing up for battle.

05:58.417 --> 06:00.907
You all know Klaus
wasn't always the hybrid.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.382
When he broke the curse that
kept his werewolf side dormant,

06:03.397 --> 06:05.068
somewhere in all that,
certain parts were now able

06:05.093 --> 06:07.026
to trump his vampire side,

06:07.420 --> 06:10.199
like the ability to pass
on the werewolf gene.

06:10.668 --> 06:12.295
That's where the werewolf
girl he's been hiding

06:12.332 --> 06:13.483
from you all comes in.

06:13.603 --> 06:15.016
She rolled through my town,

06:15.048 --> 06:16.120
pretended to be my friend,

06:16.124 --> 06:17.794
and ended up hooking up with him.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.302
Now she's pregnant with his kid.

06:21.573 --> 06:22.756
What the hell is this?

06:22.786 --> 06:24.056
Just listen.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.725
When Klaus became the hybrid,

06:28.161 --> 06:30.144
he figured out a way to
turn full-bred werewolves

06:30.144 --> 06:31.815
into creatures like him.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.836
You're looking at one of them.

06:33.956 --> 06:36.726
On the plus side, we had all
the perks of being vampires.

06:37.020 --> 06:39.417
We were stronger, faster,

06:39.723 --> 06:42.226
and the toxins in our bites
could still kill a vampire,

06:42.551 --> 06:44.673
but on the downside, we were loyal to him,

06:44.998 --> 06:47.699
like, supernaturally loyal.

06:47.819 --> 06:49.366
Right, and that's why you're here

06:49.408 --> 06:50.772
spilling all his secrets?

06:50.797 --> 06:52.655
No. That's the point, Diego.

06:53.525 --> 06:55.096
He figured out a way to break free of it.

06:55.146 --> 06:57.035
And I helped the rest of them, too.

06:57.530 --> 06:59.707
Then Klaus killed them for their betrayal.

07:01.503 --> 07:04.225
Because that is what Klaus does.

07:08.810 --> 07:09.623
Don't mind me.

07:09.655 --> 07:11.644
I'm fascinated by this story.

07:12.289 --> 07:14.435
- Hello, Tyler.
- Rebekah.

07:14.555 --> 07:16.418
Long time, no see.

07:16.969 --> 07:19.370
What Tyler is about to
tell you is that my brother

07:19.490 --> 07:22.245
can use his baby's blood
to sire more hybrids.

07:22.702 --> 07:24.178
What you will all figure out is that

07:24.178 --> 07:26.268
vampires don't stand a chance.

07:28.267 --> 07:31.548
So, Tyler, I assume you
were trying to rally this lot

07:31.579 --> 07:33.387
into making sure the baby isn't born.

07:33.562 --> 07:34.889
Yeah.

07:35.470 --> 07:36.315
You don't like it,

07:36.347 --> 07:37.873
go ahead and take your brother's side,

07:37.873 --> 07:39.287
but you know I'm right.

07:39.407 --> 07:41.715
I believe you've mistaken
the lady's intentions.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.491
All right. What's going on?

07:43.523 --> 07:45.681
You're absolutely right, Tyler.

07:45.731 --> 07:48.690
My brother is a crap
enough individual as it is.

07:48.959 --> 07:52.357
The last thing he needs is
to sire a superior species.

07:54.396 --> 07:55.841
Go on. You can tell them.

07:56.511 --> 07:58.150
She's not here to fight us.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.845
She's here to help us.

08:02.998 --> 08:04.148
That's right,

08:04.505 --> 08:05.756
but first...

08:12.663 --> 08:14.897
That is enough talk
about harming that baby.

08:16.911 --> 08:19.164
Klaus is the one we're putting a stop to.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.172
They have all forsaken me.

08:27.848 --> 08:30.066
My siblings are as deceitful and diseased

08:30.100 --> 08:32.240
as my parents ever were,

08:34.048 --> 08:35.131
accusing me

08:35.155 --> 08:37.546
of using my baby for my own gain,

08:38.966 --> 08:42.389
trusting others before their own blood.

08:42.390 --> 08:43.878
Ohh, would a laptop kill you?

08:43.998 --> 08:46.205
That typewriter was good
enough for Hemingway.

08:46.243 --> 08:47.394
Can see the resemblance...

08:47.514 --> 08:49.296
booze and random acts of violence.

08:49.416 --> 08:52.018
Elijah and Rebekah have cut to the quick

08:52.049 --> 08:54.007
with their vicious lies about me

08:54.051 --> 08:55.240
when all I've done

08:55.360 --> 08:58.525
is tried to win this battle
of wills over Marcel's control

08:58.562 --> 09:01.590
of the quarter in order
to reclaim our home.

09:01.710 --> 09:03.048
Type, please.

09:03.086 --> 09:04.231
What's the point?

09:04.287 --> 09:07.159
You just repeat the same
thing over and over again.

09:07.209 --> 09:08.485
Rebekah is out to get you.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.024
Elijah is out to get you.

09:10.144 --> 09:12.709
Is there anyone who isn't
plotting your downfall?

09:12.740 --> 09:14.505
I doubt you trust your own reflection.

09:14.762 --> 09:16.263
You know, if the daggers weren't missing,

09:16.288 --> 09:18.414
I would put one in each of their hearts,

09:18.796 --> 09:20.917
rid myself of the burden of my siblings

09:20.961 --> 09:22.737
for a couple of centuries.

09:22.793 --> 09:23.882
Look at you,

09:24.351 --> 09:26.628
repeating the same destructive cycles

09:26.641 --> 09:28.281
over and over again.

09:28.692 --> 09:32.046
You are the architect
of your own unhappiness.

09:32.427 --> 09:34.961
I don't remember asking for your advice.

09:35.255 --> 09:36.438
Oh, really?

09:36.558 --> 09:38.196
So of all the people in New Orleans,

09:38.221 --> 09:40.142
you choose someone with
a master's in psychology

09:40.186 --> 09:41.775
to record your life story.

09:41.895 --> 09:43.151
You're over 1,000 years old.

09:43.178 --> 09:44.716
Pretty damn sure you know how to type.

09:44.903 --> 09:47.531
The truth is, you compel me to come here

09:47.544 --> 09:49.308
because you have no one else to talk to,

09:49.309 --> 09:51.016
and you want to be understood.

09:51.209 --> 09:52.843
Then you compel me to forget everything

09:52.850 --> 09:53.813
as soon as I leave your presence

09:53.831 --> 09:55.202
because you're too scared to trust.

09:55.396 --> 09:58.080
I am scared of nothing.

10:05.050 --> 10:06.651
What is this?

10:06.945 --> 10:09.873
It's an ancient, mystical
plot I'm using to destroy you.

10:10.830 --> 10:12.789
Relax. It's a tattoo design.

10:13.859 --> 10:15.354
Draw on your own time.

10:15.685 --> 10:17.199
This is my time.

10:17.237 --> 10:19.220
You steal it from me.

10:27.322 --> 10:28.417
Where do you want him?

10:28.474 --> 10:30.257
Well, just put him anywhere handy

10:30.294 --> 10:32.059
until Klaus is taken care of.

10:33.185 --> 10:35.175
Where are we gonna put Klaus?

10:37.658 --> 10:39.585
He needs to be away from all the others.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.775
We don't want him fomenting descent.

10:41.988 --> 10:43.502
You know he has a knack with words.

10:43.545 --> 10:44.653
He could talk his way out of hell.

10:44.695 --> 10:46.887
Yeah. I got a spot picked
out for him in the back.

10:47.181 --> 10:48.657
Only person he's gonna be talking to

10:48.682 --> 10:50.597
for the next 52 years is himself.

10:50.847 --> 10:52.097
52?

10:52.098 --> 10:55.408
One for each year that he
kept you daggered in the 1800s.

10:55.589 --> 10:57.986
You mean, you let him keep me daggered.

10:58.734 --> 11:01.564
And I'll spend every year Klaus is in here

11:01.796 --> 11:03.654
apologizing to you for it.

11:03.723 --> 11:05.343
Well, I'll settle for long enough

11:05.393 --> 11:07.045
to experience just

11:07.165 --> 11:08.784
a little bit of happiness

11:08.904 --> 11:10.723
and ensure that my niece isn't turned

11:10.772 --> 11:13.032
into a hybrid breeding machine.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.610
It's gonna be tough to keep him in here.

11:15.654 --> 11:16.830
That little witch of yours

11:16.836 --> 11:18.500
would put the odds in our favor.

11:18.620 --> 11:19.764
I can't risk it.

11:19.884 --> 11:21.172
She's got less and less control

11:21.216 --> 11:22.636
over her magic lately.

11:22.756 --> 11:24.526
I can't even get her
out of the church attic,

11:24.563 --> 11:27.122
much less rely on her to
go to battle against Klaus.

11:27.242 --> 11:29.074
Then we'll need your very best warriors.

11:29.093 --> 11:30.989
Klaus is strong and crafty,

11:31.109 --> 11:34.323
and betrayal makes him particularly nasty.

11:36.407 --> 11:37.910
What we're doing is

11:38.083 --> 11:40.923
nothing Klaus hasn't done
to both you and your brother

11:40.961 --> 11:42.657
a dozen times over.

11:43.363 --> 11:45.572
You're not getting second
thoughts now, are you?

11:46.054 --> 11:48.287
No. These aren't second thoughts.

11:49.551 --> 11:51.715
They're feelings of regret.

11:53.067 --> 11:55.544
I should've buried him a hundred years ago.

11:56.589 --> 11:59.189
It's a hundred years we
could've been together.

12:20.821 --> 12:22.617
It's ok. It's ok.

12:31.814 --> 12:33.923
Oh, Celeste.

12:43.505 --> 12:46.295
Hayley, I'm sorry.

12:46.415 --> 12:47.997
I thought you were someone else.

12:48.016 --> 12:49.836
- Celeste?
- Yes.

12:49.956 --> 12:53.108
Whoever she was, she was smoking hot.

12:53.228 --> 12:54.804
How...

12:56.086 --> 12:58.333
Did I let you enter my thoughts?

12:59.822 --> 13:01.762
I'm not well. I should go.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.654
- This is...
- This is fine.

13:05.774 --> 13:09.589
Elijah, you're sick.
I'm taking care of you.

13:13.487 --> 13:14.998
We're being watched.

13:23.902 --> 13:25.499
Hey!

13:26.703 --> 13:28.008
Hey!

13:50.456 --> 13:53.497
Oh, man, I'll never get used to that.

13:53.617 --> 13:55.843
Why do I get the feeling
you studied theater?

13:55.906 --> 13:58.462
All the world's a stage, young Joshua,

13:58.521 --> 14:01.436
and it just so happens I have
the role of a lifetime for you.

14:10.722 --> 14:11.911
What do you got, Josh?

14:11.936 --> 14:13.575
What do I got?

14:13.695 --> 14:15.821
Klaus wants me to steal some

14:15.941 --> 14:18.806
dagger from you. It's a test, ok?

14:18.812 --> 14:20.408
He knows I'm working
for you. I'm sure of it.

14:20.452 --> 14:22.147
That bastard wants to dagger us again.

14:22.203 --> 14:23.971
He deserves everything he's gonna get.

14:24.712 --> 14:25.713
Relax.

14:25.833 --> 14:27.234
If he knew, he would've
ripped out your spine

14:27.253 --> 14:28.679
through your nose by now.

14:28.723 --> 14:30.112
Oh, great.

14:30.232 --> 14:31.864
Now I feel totally at ease.

14:31.984 --> 14:33.766
- What am I supposed to do?
- You tell him

14:33.886 --> 14:36.380
you searched high and low but
you couldn't find the dagger.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.482
Oh, God, I'm so dead.

14:37.525 --> 14:39.821
Then you tell him you saw I had it on me,

14:39.830 --> 14:42.099
that if he wants it, he'll
have to come and get it,

14:42.143 --> 14:44.376
which won't be easy because I'm paranoid

14:44.426 --> 14:46.009
and I beefed up my posse.

14:46.935 --> 14:47.599
All right.

14:47.649 --> 14:49.895
So, not doubting your mad vampire skills

14:49.933 --> 14:51.183
of destruction or anything,

14:51.202 --> 14:52.866
but Marcel is on red alert,

14:52.986 --> 14:55.501
surrounded by, like, an army.

14:55.502 --> 14:56.820
You're totally boned,

14:57.352 --> 14:59.403
- unless...
- Unless what?

15:00.295 --> 15:01.937
I overheard him arguing with Diego.

15:02.213 --> 15:03.709
Apparently, he's clearing out

15:03.752 --> 15:05.704
the compound tonight
for a date or something.

15:06.249 --> 15:08.126
That's where Marcel will be.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.165
When I run New Orleans,

15:10.197 --> 15:13.394
there will be a permanent daylight
ring in it for you, Joshua,

15:13.514 --> 15:16.390
for services rendered
unto your true king...

15:18.167 --> 15:19.380
Cool.

15:20.506 --> 15:21.502
But...

15:22.497 --> 15:25.018
if you ever betray me,

15:26.132 --> 15:29.567
I will make sure you spend
the rest of your eternal life

15:29.578 --> 15:31.394
in exquisite agony

15:31.576 --> 15:33.959
wishing for a merciful death.

15:48.870 --> 15:50.428
Adios, Klaus.

16:00.915 --> 16:03.199
What do you want?

16:03.374 --> 16:05.483
It's poitin.

16:07.275 --> 16:08.580
It'd raise the dead,

16:08.592 --> 16:10.382
kill them, and raise them again.

16:16.423 --> 16:19.826
I'd like to talk to you
about your niece Camille.

16:19.857 --> 16:21.741
I'm sure you suspect this already

16:21.861 --> 16:23.517
by the gaps in her memory.

16:23.948 --> 16:25.688
I compel her.

16:27.090 --> 16:29.849
At first, it was because
she was a useful spy

16:29.850 --> 16:32.045
but now for her own protection.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.986
I assumed a vampire was
messing with her mind,

16:35.042 --> 16:37.288
though I never anticipated a confession.

16:37.408 --> 16:39.352
She won't leave things be.

16:39.615 --> 16:41.579
Her mind churns with the permutations

16:41.611 --> 16:42.836
of what happened in this church

16:42.836 --> 16:44.657
when her twin when on his slaughter spree.

16:44.701 --> 16:47.166
Now, if she finds out what really happened,

16:47.891 --> 16:49.743
that the vampires and witch hexes

16:49.750 --> 16:50.976
were involved, she will dig

16:51.013 --> 16:53.604
and dig and dig until she digs too deep

16:53.672 --> 16:55.581
and gets herself killed.

16:56.582 --> 16:59.116
New Orleans will be the death of her.

17:00.055 --> 17:02.150
She needs to leave,

17:03.589 --> 17:05.304
and, as ironic as it may seem,

17:05.335 --> 17:07.287
I believe it should be her choice.

17:07.868 --> 17:08.845
Yes.

17:09.345 --> 17:11.016
It is ironic discussing free will

17:11.047 --> 17:12.818
with a mind-controlling vampire.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.017
She's a clever girl.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.839
She gave me a piece of
her mind earlier today.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.666
I would've killed others for less.

17:25.669 --> 17:27.964
I care about her survival.

17:28.445 --> 17:30.548
I smell war in the air,

17:30.668 --> 17:31.906
and with every war,

17:32.125 --> 17:34.358
there is the innocent victim
who could have been spared

17:34.358 --> 17:36.742
if they had just walked away.

17:36.862 --> 17:40.746
Please convince her to
walk away from New Orleans,

17:43.230 --> 17:46.370
or I'll be forced to compel her to go.

18:12.547 --> 18:14.956
Assistance, please, good sir.

18:15.018 --> 18:16.514
No. I'm much happier

18:16.539 --> 18:18.491
taking in such a wondrous view.

18:18.866 --> 18:20.517
It's perfection.

18:22.025 --> 18:25.660
Your brother is again up to no good.

18:25.926 --> 18:27.907
He's challenging the gentry to duels

18:27.950 --> 18:30.121
as though they have any
chance of a fair fight.

18:30.241 --> 18:31.867
I do grow weary

18:31.987 --> 18:34.106
of sacrificing my joy

18:34.131 --> 18:36.208
to temper my brother's mischief.

18:37.047 --> 18:39.699
Surely, you can cast a spell,

18:39.819 --> 18:41.631
put him in his place.

18:41.751 --> 18:45.033
It will take 100 witches
to put him in his place.

18:45.153 --> 18:48.000
Besides, he only ever listens to you.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.360
Yes.

18:50.035 --> 18:53.120
He certainly needs a little discipline.

18:54.909 --> 18:57.405
Perhaps a spanking of
some kind is in order.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.402
I think I shall need some rehearsal. Come.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.080
Hayley, please.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.257
This fever. My mind

19:17.294 --> 19:19.966
is flooded with these tortuous memories.

19:19.979 --> 19:21.042
You have to leave.

19:21.079 --> 19:22.793
What is your deal?

19:22.913 --> 19:24.595
You don't like people taking care of you?

19:24.652 --> 19:27.486
There are consequences for those that care.

19:28.649 --> 19:31.109
I will not have you pay that price.

19:31.164 --> 19:33.604
So you're having weird retro sex dreams.

19:33.617 --> 19:35.751
Get over it. I'm staying.

19:38.873 --> 19:41.086
So what about our visitor?

19:41.087 --> 19:42.714
What does she want?

19:42.902 --> 19:45.786
I'm guessing she's the one
that left the mystery Bible

19:45.805 --> 19:46.969
on the doorstep last night.

19:47.089 --> 19:48.570
Would be nice if she'd stick around

19:48.589 --> 19:50.204
long enough to tell me why.

19:50.324 --> 19:52.613
Hayley, you came here to gather information

19:52.650 --> 19:54.865
about my family, not to play nursemaid to a

19:55.165 --> 19:57.480
vampire with a temperature. Please...

19:58.588 --> 20:00.490
find her. Learn what you can.

20:02.298 --> 20:03.499
No.

20:03.943 --> 20:05.157
I'm staying.

20:28.553 --> 20:30.361
Klaus.

20:31.906 --> 20:33.940
You've been avoiding my calls.

20:34.306 --> 20:36.042
A little pissed off lately.

20:36.162 --> 20:39.007
Apologies for my behavior can come later.

20:39.127 --> 20:41.084
You have something of mine.

20:41.372 --> 20:42.811
I want it back.

20:45.064 --> 20:48.048
Sorry, but I can't do that.

20:52.775 --> 20:54.064
What is this?

20:54.083 --> 20:55.753
Apologies for your behavior?

20:56.381 --> 20:58.948
You don't apologize, Nik. You just act.

20:58.949 --> 21:00.126
I've had enough.

21:00.608 --> 21:02.266
We have had enough.

21:03.242 --> 21:05.012
Well, look at you,

21:05.425 --> 21:08.022
finally in possession of the one thing

21:08.022 --> 21:09.505
that can take you down.

21:10.950 --> 21:13.684
- How does it feel?
- Great.

21:26.023 --> 21:27.575
So this is it.

21:27.812 --> 21:31.422
The evil bastard Klaus has gone too far,

21:31.627 --> 21:33.192
must be punished

21:33.312 --> 21:35.728
and by his own sibling, nonetheless.

21:35.848 --> 21:38.373
How positively biblical.

21:39.812 --> 21:41.530
And you, Marcel,

21:41.531 --> 21:44.212
is this your idea of a hit?

21:44.332 --> 21:48.032
I taught you better than this
paltry excuse for a takedown.

21:48.301 --> 21:51.630
You think you can subdue me

21:52.531 --> 21:53.945
with this?

21:54.303 --> 21:55.602
No,

21:56.697 --> 21:58.612
but I think I can with this.

22:35.388 --> 22:36.852
Celeste...

22:39.987 --> 22:41.619
Forgive me.

22:41.620 --> 22:43.353
I'm sorry.

22:46.118 --> 22:47.857
A l'outrance.

22:48.323 --> 22:51.129
Huit, sept, six, cinq,

22:51.249 --> 22:53.200
quatre, trois, deux...

23:01.215 --> 23:02.654
Is that it?

23:03.633 --> 23:06.508
Is this the best New Orleans has to offer?

23:11.395 --> 23:13.516
Brother, please.

23:13.554 --> 23:14.574
This is high folly.

23:14.591 --> 23:16.187
Is it not enough that you have slaughtered

23:16.210 --> 23:17.920
dozens in just these past several weeks?

23:17.958 --> 23:18.452
Well...

23:18.464 --> 23:19.760
Word of a city littered with bodies

23:19.778 --> 23:21.286
will surely travel the oceans.

23:21.406 --> 23:23.551
Do you want to bring our father upon us?

23:23.595 --> 23:25.216
Relax, brother.

23:25.217 --> 23:27.131
I've sent rumor that
the bodies are a result

23:27.132 --> 23:30.189
of the witches seeking blood
sacrifice for their rituals.

23:31.315 --> 23:32.500
You did what?

23:33.386 --> 23:35.971
Have you forgotten Celeste is one of those

23:36.002 --> 23:37.879
that you so recklessly
pointed your finger at?

23:37.999 --> 23:39.468
Who's Celeste?

23:39.588 --> 23:40.520
Oh, yes,

23:40.545 --> 23:42.259
the witch you've been knocking around with.

23:42.290 --> 23:42.847
Well, fear not.

23:42.891 --> 23:44.374
Harlots are like rats in the quarter.

23:44.393 --> 23:46.577
You trip over one every step you take.

23:53.620 --> 23:54.891
You care about her.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.825
Well, that is unfortunate.

23:56.868 --> 24:00.043
I hear they're rounding up
the town's witches as we speak.

24:07.607 --> 24:09.346
Elijah? 

24:09.384 --> 24:12.375
Niklaus, I'll kill you, you bastard.

24:13.132 --> 24:15.827
Elijah? 

24:29.495 --> 24:31.333
Hello to you, too.

24:35.466 --> 24:37.867
Let's end this charade, shall we?

24:40.395 --> 24:43.417
Vampires of New Orleans,

24:44.174 --> 24:45.538
do recall

24:45.989 --> 24:47.715
that I am an Original,

24:47.772 --> 24:50.913
a hybrid. I cannot be killed.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.598
Eternity is an awfully long time.

24:55.092 --> 24:56.494
How long

24:56.800 --> 24:59.816
do you think Marcel will stay in power?

25:00.886 --> 25:04.270
What if one of you lot

25:05.540 --> 25:07.205
were to release me,

25:07.325 --> 25:11.522
knowing I would be eternally in your debt?

25:12.685 --> 25:14.876
Oh, I would pity

25:14.996 --> 25:17.967
those of you who dared to cross me.

25:18.087 --> 25:19.975
I can assure you,

25:20.175 --> 25:24.291
your ends would be spectacular.

25:26.744 --> 25:28.223
To borrow a trick

25:29.478 --> 25:31.216
from an old friend...

25:33.564 --> 25:36.004
Whoever picks up

25:36.711 --> 25:38.369
this coin

25:39.228 --> 25:41.128
gets to live.

25:44.394 --> 25:46.040
Now, which of you magnificent

25:46.052 --> 25:47.641
bastards wants to join me?

25:47.698 --> 25:49.512
Anyone wants that coin,

25:49.750 --> 25:51.576
pledge allegiance to Klaus,

25:52.365 --> 25:54.073
take it now.

25:54.567 --> 25:55.843
Go ahead.

25:56.926 --> 25:58.696
The choice is yours.

26:08.660 --> 26:10.268
Take him.

27:30.446 --> 27:33.527
Marcel! Come and finish this!

27:33.792 --> 27:34.847
No.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.297
- Take the coin.
- What?

27:40.548 --> 27:41.969
He won't stop until everyone is dead,

27:41.981 --> 27:43.971
and he will kill you, too. End this.

27:44.346 --> 27:46.280
Pick up the coin.

27:57.222 --> 27:58.956
Yaagh!

27:58.957 --> 28:00.923
Enough!

28:19.213 --> 28:22.178
Well, well, well.

28:23.085 --> 28:24.449
The great Marcel,

28:24.518 --> 28:27.299
self-proclaimed king of New Orleans,

28:27.527 --> 28:29.717
bowing before me.

28:29.898 --> 28:31.850
There.

28:32.263 --> 28:35.007
I hereby pledge my allegiance to you.

28:36.971 --> 28:39.595
You have the keys to my kingdom.

28:41.804 --> 28:43.186
It's yours.

29:03.291 --> 29:05.080
I was on my way home,

29:05.462 --> 29:07.247
saw you duck in here,

29:08.171 --> 29:09.773
knew exactly where you'd be.

29:09.810 --> 29:11.512
This is getting old.

29:11.850 --> 29:13.251
It's the second time this week.

29:13.257 --> 29:14.603
Third,

29:15.247 --> 29:17.243
but I cleaned it off
the day before yesterday.

29:17.363 --> 29:19.527
It's pointless. They'll just do it again.

29:20.015 --> 29:21.819
Folks need time to heal.

29:22.849 --> 29:24.533
Sean killed innocent people.

29:25.308 --> 29:27.536
No one is getting over that any time soon.

29:29.538 --> 29:30.871
I think...

29:31.953 --> 29:34.474
I think I'm losing it like he did.

29:35.759 --> 29:38.026
I found this in my pocket.

29:40.387 --> 29:41.939
The lines,

29:42.461 --> 29:44.035
it's a secret code Sean and I

29:44.035 --> 29:45.725
used to use when we were kids.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.809
I have no memory of drawing it.

29:49.797 --> 29:50.805
Something is not right.

29:50.842 --> 29:52.638
I just can't figure it out.

29:52.700 --> 29:53.964
Come here.

30:00.135 --> 30:02.450
Maybe you should

30:02.650 --> 30:04.615
leave town for a while...

30:07.230 --> 30:09.395
Give your head some space.

30:09.902 --> 30:11.871
I know your Dean.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.868
You could put your thesis on hold.

30:13.899 --> 30:15.232
I can't.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.360
This means something.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.074
I just don't know what.

30:20.075 --> 30:21.971
Not everything has meaning.

30:22.809 --> 30:25.209
Sometimes you just have to let go.

30:25.749 --> 30:27.489
You should leave New Orleans.

30:27.811 --> 30:29.998
This town isn't for everybody.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.424
Please.

30:37.011 --> 30:38.851
I'm sure you got questions.

30:38.949 --> 30:40.848
Only a thousand of them,

30:40.849 --> 30:42.061
like who are you,

30:42.092 --> 30:43.737
why are you following me,

30:44.132 --> 30:45.358
where the hell is everyone,

30:45.377 --> 30:47.250
and if the people in this book

30:47.272 --> 30:49.218
really are my family,
what happened to them?

30:49.450 --> 30:51.085
I'm Eve.

30:51.086 --> 30:52.677
I'm following you because you brought

30:52.702 --> 30:54.329
an Original to werewolf country,

30:54.342 --> 30:56.356
which is pretty much the same reason

30:56.413 --> 30:58.051
why everybody else skedaddled,

30:58.239 --> 30:59.246
and if you want to know what happened

30:59.265 --> 31:01.223
to the people in that family tree,

31:01.692 --> 31:03.726
summing it up nice and quick,

31:04.239 --> 31:05.659
Marcel happened.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.325
What did he do?

31:07.326 --> 31:09.369
He killed most of them.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.190
Later, the

31:11.233 --> 31:13.786
descendents of the ones who dodged death,

31:13.836 --> 31:17.576
he strong-armed a witch
into putting a curse on them.

31:17.696 --> 31:19.442
What kind of curse?

31:19.797 --> 31:22.608
Swap nature around, inside out,

31:23.071 --> 31:26.237
made it so their natural state was wolves.

31:26.357 --> 31:28.922
They only turn back human on the full moon.

31:30.154 --> 31:32.313
We get hunted by the marks we carry,

31:32.344 --> 31:34.072
that Crescent moon birthmark.

31:35.029 --> 31:36.743
That's why I got rid of mine.

31:37.070 --> 31:39.014
I didn't want to get found out.

31:39.484 --> 31:40.647
Good evening.

31:44.501 --> 31:46.128
Think...

31:46.807 --> 31:49.418
I might have something
which belongs to you.

31:49.481 --> 31:51.364
Elijah, I've got this.

31:52.478 --> 31:53.667
Are you ok?

31:53.842 --> 31:55.757
The wound had healed, the fever has broken,

31:55.777 --> 31:58.754
but for some strange reason,

31:59.524 --> 32:03.484
I have this sharpened
lingering sensation in my back.

32:04.892 --> 32:06.893
I have to get him home,

32:07.269 --> 32:08.695
but I'll be back, ok?

32:09.082 --> 32:10.628
I need to know more.

32:10.748 --> 32:12.424
Keep that mark covered up.

32:18.638 --> 32:20.271
What happened?

32:24.769 --> 32:27.209
I just met part of my family.

33:06.779 --> 33:08.788
Looking at what you've wrought?

33:10.346 --> 33:11.821
Look. If you're gonna kill me,

33:11.941 --> 33:13.367
let's get this over with.

33:13.368 --> 33:15.026
Why would I kill you?

33:15.514 --> 33:17.266
You picked up the coin.

33:17.535 --> 33:19.782
There are rules of
engagement in battle, Marcel.

33:19.832 --> 33:21.828
Without them, you'd have anarchy.

33:22.871 --> 33:24.769
I would, however, like to talk

33:24.772 --> 33:26.709
about accommodations,

33:26.765 --> 33:29.943
your living quarters, for example.

33:30.431 --> 33:32.545
I believe they used to be mine.

33:33.075 --> 33:35.375
You want all this? Fine. It's yours.

33:35.376 --> 33:37.942
You can put me back on
the street for all I care,

33:39.333 --> 33:41.129
but let's make one thing clear.

33:41.249 --> 33:43.626
You'll never have this...

33:44.927 --> 33:46.698
Loyalty.

33:46.942 --> 33:49.432
You can't buy it. You can't own it.

33:49.488 --> 33:50.790
You can't force it.

33:50.802 --> 33:53.261
It comes only out of love and respect

33:53.283 --> 33:55.345
for the people who believe in you.

33:58.051 --> 34:00.863
You taught me many
things, Niklaus Mikaelson,

34:00.869 --> 34:02.897
but this I learned myself,

34:03.528 --> 34:06.863
and it is something
that you will never know.

34:11.524 --> 34:13.264
Enjoy your kingdom.

34:47.849 --> 34:50.039
So thanks for the ride.

34:50.915 --> 34:53.556
Quite the awkward, little
adventure, wouldn't you say?

34:54.664 --> 34:55.864
I'm sorry I tried to hurt you.

34:55.871 --> 34:57.554
I would never want that.

34:58.874 --> 35:00.381
Elij...

35:00.957 --> 35:02.577
Tell me what happened to Celeste.

35:02.584 --> 35:04.608
- That's not important.
- It is important.

35:04.861 --> 35:06.281
1,000 years of memories,

35:06.338 --> 35:09.053
and that's what breaks
through your fever brain?

35:09.835 --> 35:11.187
I want to know.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.314
Show me.

36:01.828 --> 36:03.673
It was a cruel and bloody time

36:04.512 --> 36:05.838
to be a witch,

36:06.245 --> 36:08.654
courtesy of my wonderful brother.

36:09.548 --> 36:12.666
- She died because of Klaus?
- She died because of me,

36:14.274 --> 36:16.664
because I cared too deeply for her.

36:16.939 --> 36:19.254
I had allowed my brother

36:19.302 --> 36:20.856
to slip through my grasp.

36:20.856 --> 36:22.263
I'd loosened the reins while Celeste

36:22.288 --> 36:24.071
consumed my every moment.

36:24.259 --> 36:27.105
I'd abandoned him in the
name of my own happiness.

36:28.839 --> 36:30.602
Celeste paid the price.

36:30.652 --> 36:31.815
I don't get it.

36:33.824 --> 36:35.544
Why are we here?

36:36.026 --> 36:38.679
Why are you trying to
put together your family

36:38.704 --> 36:41.491
when it's so clear that
one part of it is broken?

36:41.611 --> 36:43.727
To me, the very definition
of the word "broken"

36:43.759 --> 36:46.386
suggests that something can be fixed.

36:46.593 --> 36:47.856
I have all eternity

36:47.881 --> 36:50.953
to accomplish one single
task... my brother's salvation.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.486
If I surrender this, then, tell me,

36:52.511 --> 36:55.038
what value would I be to my family,

36:55.051 --> 36:56.628
to myself, to...

36:59.018 --> 37:00.852
to your child?

37:06.863 --> 37:09.597
Please, no, Hayley.

37:09.997 --> 37:11.749
You've seen what happens.

37:47.235 --> 37:49.621
Elijah is home. There's only one dagger.

37:49.883 --> 37:52.103
Which one of us will
you be punishing today?

37:52.104 --> 37:54.117
I contemplated a game

37:54.237 --> 37:57.279
of eeny meeny miny...

37:57.567 --> 37:58.823
moe.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.651
You betrayed me,

38:00.771 --> 38:02.779
my own sister.

38:02.816 --> 38:04.324
Niklaus, don't you dare.

38:04.374 --> 38:07.055
Well, perhaps it should be you, brother,

38:07.064 --> 38:09.773
stealing my child away
with every fawning moment

38:09.798 --> 38:11.557
of tenderness you show to Hayley.

38:11.581 --> 38:12.991
This has nothing to do with Hayley.

38:13.008 --> 38:15.955
It has everything to do with her!

38:16.843 --> 38:19.877
She's adored you since she arrived,

38:21.122 --> 38:24.162
and now my child, my blood,

38:24.188 --> 38:26.565
will grow up to call you father.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.405
Is that what this is?

38:29.449 --> 38:30.832
You are once again

38:30.876 --> 38:32.872
worried that you will be left behind?

38:33.898 --> 38:35.300
Has history taught you nothing?

38:35.319 --> 38:37.065
We don't abandon you, Nik.

38:37.108 --> 38:38.804
You drive us away.

38:40.963 --> 38:42.764
Is that so?

38:45.342 --> 38:47.088
What have I done lately

38:47.351 --> 38:48.952
other than cooperate?

38:49.009 --> 38:51.661
I bowed down to you, brother,

38:51.968 --> 38:53.788
to make up for daggering you

38:53.826 --> 38:55.208
for the greater good of our plan

38:55.246 --> 38:56.741
to reclaim our home;

38:56.861 --> 38:58.680
looked the other way, sister,

38:58.912 --> 39:01.615
while you repeat the
same cycle with Marcel,

39:01.663 --> 39:04.167
falling again for a man
you shouldn't be with

39:04.342 --> 39:06.945
while he controls the empire that we built

39:07.065 --> 39:08.798
that he took.

39:12.144 --> 39:14.259
Now, I make no excuses

39:14.659 --> 39:16.380
for past sins,

39:16.687 --> 39:19.145
but in the one moment
when you two could have

39:19.202 --> 39:21.842
chosen to stand by me,

39:21.962 --> 39:23.263
to believe in me

39:25.233 --> 39:28.910
and believe my intentions
for my own child were pure,

39:30.173 --> 39:32.638
you chose to stand against me,

39:32.707 --> 39:35.074
to side with my enemies.

39:40.922 --> 39:43.055
I wanted our home back.

39:44.182 --> 39:45.940
Now I have it.

39:46.321 --> 39:48.330
So I'm going to live there,

39:48.450 --> 39:51.127
and the two of you,

39:52.334 --> 39:54.905
you can stay here together

39:56.149 --> 39:57.840
and rot.

40:23.726 --> 40:25.421
You're coming with me, little wolf.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.549
Why would I go anywhere with you?

40:27.669 --> 40:29.524
Because, Hayley, that child you carry

40:29.532 --> 40:31.971
is the only thing on this
earth that matters to me.

40:32.091 --> 40:35.206
Now, you can fight me on
this, but you will lose,

40:38.084 --> 40:39.886
as will anyone else who tries

40:39.933 --> 40:41.778
to stop you getting in this car.

41:03.822 --> 41:05.400
I figured it out,

41:05.401 --> 41:06.981
the note.

41:07.188 --> 41:09.496
I was thinking about it... my lost time,

41:09.540 --> 41:10.966
my foggy brain.

41:11.185 --> 41:13.193
I thought I must be going crazy like Sean,

41:13.681 --> 41:15.477
but then I thought,

41:15.478 --> 41:17.379
"what if somewhere in my subconscious,

41:17.691 --> 41:20.275
I was trying to send myself a message?"

41:22.878 --> 41:24.354
I was.

41:30.392 --> 41:34.918
I found this in the "Picayune"
newspaper archives from 1919.

41:38.690 --> 41:40.880
Look at this photo.

41:45.209 --> 41:48.519
Those men, I know them.

41:50.177 --> 41:52.348
I know both of them.
