02:35.072 --> 02:36.870
Don't answer that.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.978
Right.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.188
Yeah.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.232
You Uncle's boy?

03:48.395 --> 03:50.363
- You Jerome?
- Yeah. Come on in.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.361
Come on. Hurry up.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.448
Have a seat.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.705
Make yourself comfortable.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.169
So you bring it?

04:20.552 --> 04:21.769
We good?

04:21.928 --> 04:23.475
Just a sec.

04:30.479 --> 04:31.947
There you go, little man.

04:37.694 --> 04:38.866
What you doing?

04:39.321 --> 04:40.823
You're 500 short.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.616
What are you talking about? The deal was 25.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.751
- No, the deal was 3.
- No, deal was for 25.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.083
- The deal was 3.
- Wanna call Uncle? Have him tell you?

04:47.245 --> 04:49.122
No, Uncle knows the deal. You call him.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.586
- Hey, you little shit.
- Hey.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.091
You better be easy with that.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.760
I started easy.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.678
Now...

04:59.841 --> 05:03.471
...you owe another 5.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.310
Go in the refrigerator.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.568
There's a stack of cash in there.
There's $1000.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.603
You can take the 5.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.031
No, I said you could take 5.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.575
- You lied.
- Oh, okay.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.540
Okay, don't even worry about it, little man.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.505
Thank you.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.753
Stop talking.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.216
Stop talking. Shut up.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.847
You're making my head hurt.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.760
You're late. Get in here. Sit down.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.553
Because that is your job.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.224
Shut the door.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.105
Shut the door!

06:37.355 --> 06:39.699
What is this? You have crumbs on your shirt.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.451
I didn't give you cash for food.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.863
That means you take from bag.

06:44.029 --> 06:47.204
Look at me.

06:47.365 --> 06:51.290
You want I cut the tip of your finger off
for stealing? Is that what you want?

06:51.953 --> 06:53.000
Give it to me.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.722
The pastry was 3.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.184
I used 20 and put the rest back.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.517
I got an extra 500 from the mark.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.268
You what?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.900
He tried to short us 5, so I handled it.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.902
Still doesn't mean you get to steal from me.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.315
Come on, Danny. We feed you here.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.484
You don't go starving.

07:21.650 --> 07:22.902
Your second time.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.662
It's the second time you steal from me.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.080
I was hungry.

07:33.828 --> 07:37.958
Next time you steal from me, I cut
your hand off. I put it in refrigerator.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.468
For that, I send you back out now. Get up.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.840
Hey!

08:24.004 --> 08:25.551
Hey! Asshole!

08:29.676 --> 08:31.098
Hey!

09:26.191 --> 09:28.285
Back from the dead, huh?

09:31.279 --> 09:32.326
Where am I?

09:34.157 --> 09:35.830
You're safe.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.578
You're in my apartment.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.791
And who the hell are you?

09:40.205 --> 09:41.957
I'm Mary.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.215
You were hurt. Passed out in an alley.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.221
Come on. Eat.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.551
- Where's my bag?
- You'll get it back.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.391
- Everything inside it too.
- I need it now.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.055
Sit down.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.019
I need to get back.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.068
Back where?

10:02.227 --> 10:04.321
I'm supposed to go to Back Bay.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.523
I tell you what.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.034
You sit down, have some food...

10:10.193 --> 10:12.867
...I'll take you to Back Bay myself.
How's that?

10:30.922 --> 10:32.424
Whoa, slow down.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.058
When's the last time you ate?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.316
So, what's in Back Bay?

10:41.808 --> 10:42.855
Your mother.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.571
- What, you got family or friends there?
- What's with all the questions, lady?

10:51.025 --> 10:52.072
You a cop?

10:52.944 --> 10:54.867
Not exactly.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.620
I'm just trying to help. That's all.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.752
Yeah? I don't need your help.

11:01.244 --> 11:04.589
See, I think you do, especially knowing
what's in that backpack of yours.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.969
Let me guess: two bricks of brown...

11:09.669 --> 11:13.469
...and a semiautomatic handgun?

11:21.306 --> 11:24.560
The man who gave you that bag,
what's his name?

11:24.726 --> 11:27.275
- He'll kill me for talking to you.
- He won't lay a finger on you.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.189
He'll kill us both.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.984
You know what happens...

11:33.151 --> 11:35.370
...if you get busted with that bag?

11:38.072 --> 11:41.542
- The cops will turn you into an informant.
- Yeah?

11:42.410 --> 11:45.585
- Well, I ain't no snitch, so...
- Yeah, well, that doesn't matter.

11:45.747 --> 11:49.001
All that matters is what people think.

11:49.167 --> 11:53.092
And nobody likes talking to kids
who talks to cops. Right?

11:53.254 --> 11:55.257
Especially where we come from.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.680
Look, I'm on your side.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.939
Come on, let's clean up that cut.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.525
You got blood all over your shirt.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.699
Stay right here.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.380
Here you go.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.350
Who did that to you?

12:40.969 --> 12:41.970
Uncle?

12:43.304 --> 12:46.103
- How you know Uncle?
- Don't worry about that.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.560
Did he do that to you?

12:51.354 --> 12:52.901
Where you going?

12:53.064 --> 12:54.987
To teach somebody some manners.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.493
Shit. I'm coming with you.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.772
- What are you about to do?
- You just stay in the car.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.642
Keep the doors locked. Okay?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.146
Put your hood on.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.044
What can I do for you?

13:56.419 --> 13:59.138
It's all there. He didn't touch a thing.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.177
A bit out of the way for you, isn't it?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.220
I thought I'd return it.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.684
- We don't want hard feelings.
- No hard feelings?

14:07.847 --> 14:09.349
Yeah.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.855
You think because you're
Benny goddamn Spencer's girl...

14:15.021 --> 14:20.403
...you get to walk in here and shoot
your mouth off like a parrot with tits?

14:22.320 --> 14:24.994
Okay, all right. Now you're just being rude.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.283
Danny belongs to me.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.076
Danny belongs to no one.

14:29.452 --> 14:33.332
It's all right. You know, I like your style.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.129
No hard feelings.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.758
Why don't you go get the little thief.
Bring him up here.

14:42.924 --> 14:44.801
And then in a few years...

14:45.927 --> 14:48.021
...if I don't want him anymore...

14:48.179 --> 14:51.149
...and if he's still alive,
maybe I sell him to you.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.981
I think you mean if you're still alive.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.285
Uncle?

15:33.641 --> 15:34.733
What did you do?

15:34.892 --> 15:36.940
I just fucked up.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.397
Bad.

16:02.545 --> 16:06.220
You sleeping on the sofa, okay?
You should be comfortable.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.896
I gotta run out for a bit.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.808
- You just gonna leave me in your house?
- Yeah. Why not?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.897
- I could rob you.
- Yeah, but you're not.

16:17.059 --> 16:20.108
Make yourself at home.
Get whatever you want out of the fridge.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.899
You know where the bathroom is.
Takes a minute for hot water to come up.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.863
One rule:

16:25.026 --> 16:26.744
Stay out of my room.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.884
You can't check in?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.720
My phone died.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.809
Someone took out Uncle and his crew.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.224
Kozlovs think it was us.

18:20.391 --> 18:21.734
Where's Benny?

18:22.977 --> 18:25.150
- His office.
- I'll be up.

18:42.913 --> 18:47.009
The Kozlovs think we did this
to take Uncle's territory.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.296
- That's ridiculous.
- Of course it is.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.089
Whoever killed that douche bag
did the world a favor.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.053
- Who did it?
- Asshole like him...

18:53.215 --> 18:55.263
- ...everyone's a suspect.
- Okay, Walter.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.520
We gotta make a move before they retaliate.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.602
- Last thing we want is another war.
- Maybe exactly what we need is a war.

19:00.765 --> 19:01.892
Maybe he's right, Pop.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.395
Mary?

19:08.648 --> 19:10.195
Mary.

19:10.358 --> 19:11.576
You've been so quiet.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.870
I was just thinking.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.372
You're right.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.077
We don't need another war.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.664
We need to put this to bed now.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.586
Tom.

19:22.745 --> 19:26.045
- Arrange a meeting for tomorrow.
- You got it, Pop.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.134
You went through my things last night.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.130
I thought I told you to stay out of my room.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.509
Oh, you think that's funny?

21:01.844 --> 21:03.266
No.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.185
Why you got guns in your room?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.396
You didn't see any guns.
Do you understand me?

21:12.605 --> 21:14.778
I said, do you understand me?

21:19.111 --> 21:20.238
Yeah, I got it.

21:22.782 --> 21:26.457
The next time I tell you to do something,
you better listen.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.416
We understand each other?

21:28.871 --> 21:30.373
I got it.

21:32.374 --> 21:35.093
Because I gotta leave, but I'll be back.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.970
Stay in this apartment. Lock the door.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.223
Do not answer it under any circumstance.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.758
Do you understand me?

21:40.925 --> 21:42.723
Yeah, whatever, man.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.391
Don't "whatever" me.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.647
What are you gonna do, huh?

21:46.806 --> 21:48.649
If you gonna hit me, just do it.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.112
Sorry.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.149
I'm sorry.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.938
Please spare me your sympathy.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.021
Take this. Here.

22:35.896 --> 22:40.402
Uncle was my father's youngest brother.
Not his brightest and not my favorite...

22:40.860 --> 22:42.078
...but he was family.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.198
What we want is justice.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.367
We're here to avoid any misunderstanding.

22:47.533 --> 22:51.128
Tell me, how do we know it wasn't
the pervert Walter King?

22:51.287 --> 22:53.585
He and Uncle always had bad blood.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.171
Whoever killed Uncle
was not sanctioned by me.

22:57.251 --> 23:01.848
But if they work for me, I can assure you
they will be dealt with immediately.

23:02.006 --> 23:04.725
You've always been a smart man.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.727
But what you asking me to do, Benny?

23:06.886 --> 23:08.889
Forgive and forget?

23:09.054 --> 23:11.773
He's telling you, be careful
where you point your fingers.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.902
Anyone could have done this,
but if it's one of my people...

23:15.352 --> 23:16.649
...you have my word.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.359
I appreciate that.

23:18.522 --> 23:21.947
And now there's something else
I would like to discuss.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.656
- The West End.
- What about it?

23:23.819 --> 23:26.072
- Give it to us.
- Are you out of your mind?

23:26.238 --> 23:29.663
- In the matter of reparation.
- I didn't come to renegotiate territories.

23:30.326 --> 23:35.128
But I will definitely give
this matter serious consideration.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.875
You do that, Benny.

23:42.212 --> 23:44.180
- I promise you, Luka.
- Good.

23:45.299 --> 23:46.972
Thank you, Benny.

24:33.263 --> 24:36.108
So they think they're gonna use
that bullshit as leverage...

24:36.266 --> 24:38.519
...to reallocate territory? No way.

24:38.936 --> 24:42.111
We need to find out who the hell started
this mess by wasting Uncle.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.108
Walter.

24:44.608 --> 24:47.532
Luka said Uncle and Walter had bad blood.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.496
Uncle called him a perv.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.242
He said Walter abused one of his boys.

24:52.408 --> 24:56.083
We need to find out who started this
and take that son of a bitch out.

24:56.245 --> 24:58.964
No. No, we just need to throw him a bone.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.420
That's bullshit.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.552
- We need to send the right message.
- Just give him Walter.

25:04.878 --> 25:08.178
- He targeted Uncle before. Luka said so.
- That was a long time ago.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.718
Come on, man, grudges don't die.
You know that.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.636
He hates him. You heard him.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.561
If anybody wanted Uncle dead,
it would be Walter.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.566
She's not wrong.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.649
Walter would be
the only one arrogant enough...

25:20.811 --> 25:23.314
...to make a move without my blessing.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.154
Mary. And you will do this?

25:27.276 --> 25:29.654
He jogs every day at 3 p.m.

25:30.404 --> 25:32.327
Like clockwork.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.702
- Done.
- So be it.

25:36.285 --> 25:37.582
I'll sell it to Luka.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.009
Hey.

25:52.634 --> 25:53.761
You okay?

25:54.720 --> 25:57.724
- What you mean about Uncle?
- What about him?

25:58.766 --> 26:00.769
You said I ain't have to worry
about him no more.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.186
You don't.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.154
No one does.

26:07.733 --> 26:08.780
Oh, shit.

26:08.942 --> 26:09.989
- Badass.
- Hey.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.951
- What the hell are you? Some kind of...?
- Your mouth.

26:14.615 --> 26:17.744
Look, I told you I wasn't gonna let
anybody touch you, and I meant it.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.169
So you do all that for me, huh?

26:23.332 --> 26:25.960
Damn sure didn't do it for myself.

26:26.710 --> 26:27.882
Well, thanks.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.672
That's dope.

26:31.799 --> 26:35.019
But you know he got friends.
They could be looking for me right now.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.849
Here.

26:42.643 --> 26:44.441
- So, lady...
- Mary.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.980
Please. Thank you.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.692
Fine. Mary.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.745
Why do you got all them guns in your room?

26:53.904 --> 26:55.281
The ones I didn't see.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.201
- Business.
- What kind of business?

26:58.367 --> 26:59.869
Security, okay?

27:00.035 --> 27:02.254
- "Security" like protection?
- Yep.

27:02.412 --> 27:03.914
Protection for who?

27:04.081 --> 27:07.130
- None of your business.
- Why you got that cash in your room?

27:07.292 --> 27:10.387
Okay, look, not your business again.
Do you like hot dogs, fat mouth?

27:10.546 --> 27:12.139
- No shit. Who don't like hot dogs?
- Watch your...

27:12.297 --> 27:14.015
I'm hungry as a mother...

27:14.550 --> 27:17.304
I got a lot of work to do with you.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.016
I'm playing with you, you know that, right?

27:19.179 --> 27:22.604
You need to be careful with how you play
with adults because I don't play.

27:23.225 --> 27:25.649
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.859
Better be glad you like hot dogs.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.991
I don't trust people
who don't like a good dog.

27:32.359 --> 27:33.611
How you like yours?

27:33.777 --> 27:34.949
I don't know. Ketchup?

27:35.112 --> 27:36.455
Ketchup? That's all?

27:36.613 --> 27:39.412
- I'd like mine with the works, please.
- What's "the works"?

27:39.575 --> 27:40.918
Everything.

27:41.952 --> 27:43.704
- Two with the works.
- Two?

27:44.997 --> 27:46.465
What you gonna eat?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.673
You better make that four.

27:50.878 --> 27:54.974
Yeah, I could eat these all day long.
I don't even want to know what's in them.

28:04.850 --> 28:08.605
How about we sit on that bench over there...

28:09.021 --> 28:10.523
...and knock these puppies out.

28:11.607 --> 28:12.699
I got a better idea.

28:25.537 --> 28:29.007
This is where I come to escape.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.378
Pretty cool, huh?

28:33.253 --> 28:35.301
Beyond cool.

28:36.506 --> 28:37.849
Yeah.

28:39.468 --> 28:40.515
Before she left us...

28:42.095 --> 28:43.938
...my mom used to take me here.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.812
Used to sit out on the water.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.979
Big sack lunches.

28:50.646 --> 28:51.818
Feed the seagulls.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.079
My father was killed.

29:02.449 --> 29:03.826
A year ago.

29:06.662 --> 29:10.838
After that, I went to go stay
with my grandma till she died.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.471
And then what?

29:19.132 --> 29:21.806
They wanted to send me to some home for boys.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.016
Who?

29:24.012 --> 29:26.356
Those assholes at Child Services.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.147
I ran.

29:29.726 --> 29:32.320
Lived in the parks for some time.

29:32.896 --> 29:35.365
Then one of Uncle's boys found me.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.364
I guess you know the rest.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.667
Finish your hot dog.

30:15.439 --> 30:18.659
Hey. Listen up.
I gotta talk to you for a second. Look.

30:19.860 --> 30:22.238
Listen, as long as you're here,
you keep that door locked...

30:22.404 --> 30:24.998
...and don't you open it. Don't go anywhere.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.911
You being here is our secret, right?

30:28.076 --> 30:29.828
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, no, no, look at me.

30:29.995 --> 30:33.124
No "yeah, yeah." This is serious. Okay?

30:33.915 --> 30:35.087
I got it.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.423
"I got it." Let me see that ball.

30:38.211 --> 30:40.430
Stop bouncing it on my wall.

30:42.215 --> 30:44.013
I'll be back.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.688
What did I say?

30:48.847 --> 30:51.145
You want me to come back over there?

32:41.418 --> 32:43.136
Cover him. Cover!

32:57.893 --> 33:00.612
They got five of our best guys.

33:00.770 --> 33:03.615
They put a bullet in Mateo's shoulder.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.120
Derek's in intensive care.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.911
It could've been you or me, Pop.

33:12.073 --> 33:16.124
There's only one thing these animals
understand, and that's an eye for an eye.

33:16.286 --> 33:19.005
I say we hit the Kozlovs back hard now.

33:19.581 --> 33:21.128
Slow...

33:21.958 --> 33:23.085
...down.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.670
We're not starting a war...

33:25.837 --> 33:29.592
...until we're absolutely sure it was them.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.135
You wouldn't have said that 20 years ago.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.395
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm not trying to say anything.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.897
If you can't handle it, I will.

33:47.484 --> 33:48.906
Omar, what are you thinking?

33:49.069 --> 33:51.493
- Kozlovs.
- Me too. I need proof.

33:51.655 --> 33:53.248
I got it, boss.

34:13.342 --> 34:16.722
<i>...your badge? He has a gun. Shoot him!</i>

34:38.118 --> 34:40.121
Who the hell are you?

34:40.286 --> 34:42.005
I'm Danny.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.341
Who are you?

34:44.498 --> 34:46.797
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

34:46.960 --> 34:49.384
Looking for Mary.
She's not answering her phone.

34:49.545 --> 34:51.422
You live around here?

34:52.215 --> 34:53.888
Yeah. Jamaica Plain.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.768
So how you know Mary?

34:59.556 --> 35:01.524
Let's try this again.

35:02.642 --> 35:03.985
How you know Mary?

35:05.395 --> 35:07.113
From around.

35:07.731 --> 35:10.280
- How you know Mary?
- We work together.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.614
In security business?

35:11.985 --> 35:13.328
Security business.

35:13.486 --> 35:16.865
That's a good one. As soon
as she gets home, you tell her to call me.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.701
It's very important.

35:19.159 --> 35:20.581
You understand that?

35:21.703 --> 35:22.750
Okay.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.002
Give her the message.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.336
Danny?

36:11.294 --> 36:12.796
I told you not to go...

36:12.962 --> 36:15.306
- ...in my goddamn room.
- You lied to me.

36:15.465 --> 36:17.388
- I lied to you?
- Yeah.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.052
What, you think I'm stupid?

36:19.219 --> 36:21.392
I told you not to go through my things,
Danny.

36:21.554 --> 36:24.273
Your friend came over. Nice guy.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.526
Tom? And you let him in?

36:26.685 --> 36:28.483
He had a key.

36:29.229 --> 36:31.357
- Is that your boyfriend?
- Not anymore.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.491
Yeah, but he was.

36:34.067 --> 36:37.537
- Look, it's complicated, kid.
- Complicated how?

36:39.572 --> 36:42.576
Let's just say,
Tom is now like a brother to me.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.915
- But he wasn't always.
- No, Oprah, he wasn't.

36:46.830 --> 36:49.424
- What the hell was he doing in here?
- I don't know.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.050
Well, what did he say?

36:51.209 --> 36:53.803
He said you're not in security,
that's for damn sure.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.839
Yeah, well, Tom is an asshole.

36:56.339 --> 36:59.093
- What else did he say?
- He said he wanted you to call him.

36:59.259 --> 37:00.932
It was important. It was urgent.

37:01.094 --> 37:02.471
He was pretty pissed.

37:03.096 --> 37:04.143
Lady...

37:06.057 --> 37:08.185
...what is it that you really do?

37:09.519 --> 37:11.988
I'm a nun. I'm a goddamn nun.

37:12.147 --> 37:14.070
What's it to you, you nosy, little shit?

37:14.232 --> 37:16.860
Okay, you know what?
You want me to leave? I'll go!

37:17.026 --> 37:19.199
Okay, fine. There's the door. Go.

37:21.448 --> 37:24.497
- Is that what you want?
- Did I say that's what I want? Did I?

37:36.713 --> 37:37.760
Look...

37:39.966 --> 37:42.139
...you don't have to worry about Tom, okay?

37:42.302 --> 37:45.147
This is about you and me.

37:45.305 --> 37:46.978
This is about us.

37:47.432 --> 37:48.854
You understand?

37:49.726 --> 37:51.023
Yeah.

37:51.186 --> 37:52.938
Good.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.128
You kept your key?

38:13.500 --> 38:16.049
Why can't I reach you no more?
Called you, no answer.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.589
Texted you, no answer.
Radio silence. Not a call.

38:18.755 --> 38:21.179
What's so goddamn important
you had to barge into...?

38:21.341 --> 38:24.265
Kozlovs tried to hit Pop.
That's what's important.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.555
- After we gave them Walter?
- They hit him before.

38:26.721 --> 38:27.768
They don't care about Walter.

38:27.931 --> 38:30.901
They're trying to use it
as an opportunity to take out Benny.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.735
How do you know?

38:32.894 --> 38:34.316
Come on.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.461
Look at me.

38:52.455 --> 38:53.547
No.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.983
I'm not asking you again.

39:26.739 --> 39:29.333
Do you know how long
he's been in there with Tom?

39:29.492 --> 39:31.119
Two hours.

39:31.995 --> 39:34.123
You know what he's told him?

39:35.081 --> 39:37.880
- Everything.
- What's our next move?

39:38.042 --> 39:40.887
Tom's new friend volunteered
that Luka will be hosting a meeting...

39:41.045 --> 39:43.844
...for all the members
of the family this Friday.

39:44.507 --> 39:48.353
I need you and Tom to deliver a message.

39:49.512 --> 39:50.934
I understand.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.941
I hear you've taken in a stray.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.609
Yeah, it's no big deal. I was gonna tell you.

39:58.771 --> 39:59.818
And yet, you didn't.

40:01.274 --> 40:02.821
So you're mad at me?

40:02.984 --> 40:04.486
Should I be?

40:04.861 --> 40:07.535
He was hurt. He needed help.

40:08.823 --> 40:11.167
He's only been with me a couple days.

40:11.326 --> 40:12.828
- How old?
- Twelve.

40:12.994 --> 40:15.292
Or 13. I don't really know.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.674
So bring him over to the house for dinner.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.339
It's Mina's birthday.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.254
What's up?

40:22.420 --> 40:25.139
We was just talking about
your mother's birthday party.

40:25.298 --> 40:27.141
With everything, we're having a party?

40:27.300 --> 40:30.645
You want to tell her that
her 65th birthday party's been canceled?

40:31.512 --> 40:33.981
- No.
- Okay.

40:39.979 --> 40:41.401
Hey.

40:42.065 --> 40:44.284
Let's get this done.

40:46.778 --> 40:50.032
Why do I need a sport coat?
I can't even pronounce half of this stuff.

40:50.198 --> 40:52.371
Because you've been invited somewhere.

40:52.533 --> 40:53.910
- So?
- And a proper young man...

40:54.410 --> 40:55.878
...wears a proper jacket.

40:56.412 --> 40:59.006
Besides, we need to get you a new sweatshirt.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.839
- What's wrong with my hoodie?
- When is the last time you washed it?

41:02.001 --> 41:03.969
- "Washed"?
- Exactly. Come here.

41:05.588 --> 41:07.340
Give it here.

41:07.507 --> 41:09.510
Thank you very much.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.182
- Here.
- We'll get a new... Watch the attitude.

41:12.345 --> 41:15.349
- And you gonna get some new jeans too.
- I like that hoodie.

41:17.558 --> 41:19.777
This is nice. Look at this.

41:19.936 --> 41:22.155
- Blue hoodie.
- It's all right.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.069
No?

41:25.650 --> 41:28.654
- I think this one suits you perfectly.
- Oh, that is nice.

41:28.820 --> 41:31.369
- I hate it.
- Excuse me.

41:31.531 --> 41:33.033
- What the hell is that?
- Come here.

41:33.199 --> 41:36.123
It's called respect, all right?
Put the damn jacket on.

41:36.285 --> 41:39.039
- I don't wanna put the damn jacket...
- Watch your mouth.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.837
- You look very handsome.
- Yes.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.132
I look like a douche bag.

41:48.297 --> 41:49.344
Language.

41:49.716 --> 41:51.639
Perhaps he'd be more comfortable at...

41:51.801 --> 41:54.145
- No, we're good right here.
- Oh, well...

41:56.723 --> 41:59.898
So who's gonna be at this thing
you keep telling me about?

42:00.059 --> 42:01.151
Family.

42:01.310 --> 42:04.405
Well, if it's family,
isn't a nice shirt good enough?

42:04.564 --> 42:05.861
No, it's not.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.992
- Not for Benny.
- Who's Benny?

42:08.151 --> 42:09.528
Tom's father.

42:09.694 --> 42:12.994
- You mean Tom, your boyfriend?
- Oh, shut up. He's not my boyfriend.

42:14.157 --> 42:15.625
Anyway, Benny's Tom's father...

42:15.783 --> 42:18.127
...and he used to take care of me
when I was a kid.

42:18.911 --> 42:21.881
Take care of you like you take care of me?

42:23.916 --> 42:25.384
Kind of.

42:26.419 --> 42:28.137
Kind of how?

42:33.509 --> 42:36.763
When I was a kid, my father,
he wasn't nice to me and my mom.

42:36.929 --> 42:39.182
So when I got old enough to run, I ran away.

42:41.017 --> 42:43.236
And I was living in the streets for a while.

42:45.646 --> 42:46.864
Like me?

42:48.775 --> 42:50.197
Yep, just like you.

42:53.738 --> 42:54.990
Here she come again.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.830
- How's this?
- Much better.

42:57.992 --> 43:00.416
Try it on. Here.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.085
- Try it on.
- I don't wanna try it on.

43:03.247 --> 43:05.591
- Come on, now. Move.
- I want out of this bougie-ass neighbor...

43:05.750 --> 43:06.922
Watch your mouth.

43:08.544 --> 43:10.012
Blue is classy.

43:10.171 --> 43:12.424
Yes, look at you. See, you like it.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.059
Change is good. Come on.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.144
<i>Remember what I told you about Benny, right?</i>

43:20.306 --> 43:21.979
<i>If he starts asking questions?</i>

43:22.141 --> 43:25.270
Don't tell him who I worked for,
and don't tell him about Uncle.

43:25.436 --> 43:27.063
That's right.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.027
Damn.

43:29.190 --> 43:30.692
Come here.

43:32.735 --> 43:33.987
What's your last name?

43:34.153 --> 43:36.747
- Warren.
- Danny Warren from...?

43:36.906 --> 43:39.125
- Dorchester.
- What street?

43:41.160 --> 43:43.037
Norfolk Avenue.

43:43.996 --> 43:45.498
What about your parents?

43:47.166 --> 43:48.793
I never met them.

43:49.710 --> 43:52.179
I was in a lot of foster homes,
but they didn't work out.

43:53.422 --> 43:54.844
That's right.

43:56.509 --> 43:57.556
Look...

43:58.719 --> 44:00.938
...I don't care how nice Benny is to you.

44:02.348 --> 44:04.442
He is not to be trusted.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.728
He is not your friend.

44:07.103 --> 44:08.150
Remember that.

44:10.565 --> 44:11.987
Okay.

44:12.775 --> 44:15.278
Now, let's go over this again.
What's your last name?

44:15.444 --> 44:17.697
- Danny Warren.
- Danny Warren, huh?

44:18.573 --> 44:21.076
- Where you from?
- Dorchester.

44:21.534 --> 44:25.630
One of my best friends growing up
was named Danny.

44:25.788 --> 44:28.291
We called him "Danny Boy."

44:28.958 --> 44:30.505
Anybody ever call you that?

44:31.043 --> 44:32.090
Some people.

44:32.253 --> 44:34.972
I wanna toast my wife.

44:35.131 --> 44:37.680
To 45 more years of happiness.

44:37.842 --> 44:40.266
- Happy birthday, Mina.
- Happy birthday, beautiful.

44:40.428 --> 44:41.805
Thank you. Thank you.

44:47.643 --> 44:51.398
- What do I hear? Shoot.
- Oh, Jesus. Oh, my God.

44:51.564 --> 44:54.909
You remember how we used to dance to this?

44:56.319 --> 44:59.243
- Benny move.
- Like Fred and Ginger.

44:59.405 --> 45:03.160
- Oh, no. Ginger's tired tonight, baby.
- Oh, no.

45:03.326 --> 45:06.045
Well, Mary, it's me and you.

45:12.501 --> 45:15.129
- Good luck, girl.
- Yes. I'm gonna need it.

45:21.761 --> 45:24.731
You've seemed distracted.
What's on your mind?

45:26.432 --> 45:28.651
Well, just...

45:29.101 --> 45:32.571
Just something I've been thinking about
the last couple of days.

45:33.147 --> 45:35.275
- What?
- Well, I...

45:35.441 --> 45:39.913
I'm just thinking that it's time for me
to move on, you know?

45:40.363 --> 45:43.833
I just wanna do something else with my life.

45:45.243 --> 45:47.166
Look at me, sweetheart.

45:47.328 --> 45:49.046
Is this about Tom?

45:49.205 --> 45:50.707
No, it's not about him.

45:50.873 --> 45:52.841
It's about me.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.048
Oh, okay, then.

45:55.795 --> 45:58.298
Well, this can wait till tomorrow.

46:00.591 --> 46:03.515
Because today is about Mina.

46:03.678 --> 46:06.306
- Of course.
- All right?

46:06.472 --> 46:08.065
Okay.

46:17.817 --> 46:21.742
Well, I could never understand how
people could just give up their children.

46:21.904 --> 46:23.827
I better get back out there to him.

46:25.241 --> 46:26.538
Hi, baby.

46:28.244 --> 46:30.417
- Red velvet.
- It's good.

46:30.579 --> 46:32.206
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- Thank you.

46:32.665 --> 46:34.508
Yes, please.

46:34.667 --> 46:37.842
Would you mind taking Danny a slice,
Mama? Give me a sec with Mary?

46:38.254 --> 46:39.631
- Sure.
- All right, thanks.

46:40.006 --> 46:41.428
Thank you.

46:44.885 --> 46:46.808
You look real beautiful tonight.

46:46.971 --> 46:49.565
So, what's on your mind, Tom?

46:51.517 --> 46:52.814
- The kid.
- What about him?

46:52.977 --> 46:55.196
Cleans up real nice.

46:56.022 --> 46:59.401
- Danny Warren from Dorchester.
- Yep.

46:59.567 --> 47:02.616
He told me Jamaica Plain. So I asked myself:

47:02.778 --> 47:06.703
"Why would a kid from Jamaica Plain say
he's from Dorchester?"

47:06.866 --> 47:07.993
What's your point?

47:08.159 --> 47:10.378
Then I seemed to remember,
wasn't there a hit...

47:10.536 --> 47:12.834
...on a bookie last year from Jamaica Plain?

47:12.997 --> 47:14.419
- What was the last name?
- I don't remember.

47:14.582 --> 47:16.084
Miller.

47:16.250 --> 47:19.925
Funny. I also remember a news story
that mentioned a kid that survived.

47:20.087 --> 47:22.806
- Don't make this about us.
- You said there was no kid.

47:22.965 --> 47:25.309
Yeah, because I don't do kids,
and you know that.

47:25.468 --> 47:27.095
- That's not the point.
- It was for me.

47:27.678 --> 47:28.975
- Did he see you?
- No.

47:29.138 --> 47:30.731
- Did you see him?
- No.

47:30.890 --> 47:34.485
Mary, is there any way that kid
can connect this family to that hit?

47:34.643 --> 47:37.192
- No.
- You better hope not.

47:38.314 --> 47:40.783
- Where'd you find him?
- I'm not doing this tonight.

47:40.941 --> 47:43.740
And I'm not doing it here.
Just leave the kid out of this.

47:43.903 --> 47:45.746
How you think the old man's gonna react
when he hears this?

47:45.905 --> 47:49.159
Maybe we should go over there
and tell him together.

47:50.534 --> 47:52.377
I mean, you know how he loves secrets.

47:53.746 --> 47:55.999
We don't need no more problems.

47:56.165 --> 47:58.168
This thing with the kid...

47:58.334 --> 48:01.088
...it could turn out
to be very dangerous, Mary.

48:01.962 --> 48:04.135
- People find out who...
- That's not gonna happen.

48:04.298 --> 48:08.019
- What if the old man doesn't like it?
- What if I go tell your father...

48:08.177 --> 48:09.770
...you called him "the old man"?

48:10.763 --> 48:13.892
- Oh, Tom, what are you doing?
- I'm trying to apologize.

48:14.809 --> 48:16.311
I'm sorry.

48:17.812 --> 48:19.906
I'm not gonna say nothing about the kid...

48:20.064 --> 48:22.613
...or his name to the old man.

48:23.067 --> 48:25.115
I just want us back the way we were.

48:26.362 --> 48:28.615
Tom, I can't do this with you, okay?

48:29.073 --> 48:31.121
Come here, come here, come here.

48:32.493 --> 48:35.918
Tell me you didn't love me.

48:36.664 --> 48:38.667
For so many years.

48:39.458 --> 48:42.303
And that girl never stopped loving you.

48:45.339 --> 48:48.639
- I'm just not that girl anymore.
- What's that even mean?

48:48.801 --> 48:51.646
It means I should probably get Danny home.

48:51.804 --> 48:53.226
You need to get some rest.

48:53.848 --> 48:55.225
We have a big job tomorrow.

49:06.485 --> 49:08.158
Good morning.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.663
You hungry?

49:10.364 --> 49:11.411
Cereal.

49:25.004 --> 49:26.927
He said I could come over whenever I want.

49:28.090 --> 49:29.467
Benny.

49:31.552 --> 49:32.679
What about him?

49:32.845 --> 49:35.348
He said I could come over whenever I want.

49:38.476 --> 49:40.729
Danny, look, I...

49:40.895 --> 49:44.650
You know that money you found
in my closet? With the guns?

49:44.815 --> 49:46.988
If something happens...

49:47.985 --> 49:50.238
...I want you to have it, okay? It's yours.

49:50.404 --> 49:51.997
Okay. What are you talking about?

49:52.156 --> 49:54.329
I just... I just want you
to be prepared, okay?

49:54.492 --> 49:58.372
You know where we from. If you stay
ready, you ain't gotta get ready, right?

49:59.079 --> 50:01.377
That money is your freedom.

50:02.374 --> 50:03.796
Okay?

50:06.837 --> 50:09.966
I want you to take that money,
and I want you to run.

50:10.132 --> 50:12.931
I want you to run as fast as you can.

50:13.093 --> 50:16.643
I want you to buy you a real nice life.

50:17.556 --> 50:19.058
Okay?

50:19.517 --> 50:20.689
Promise me that.

50:22.269 --> 50:23.816
Promise me.

50:25.564 --> 50:27.111
I promise.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.193
Okay.

50:29.944 --> 50:31.912
Go ahead and eat.

51:43.350 --> 51:46.104
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

51:46.729 --> 51:49.232
Pop says you're talking
about getting out again.

51:50.524 --> 51:53.653
- Is it because of me?
- No, it's not because of you.

51:53.819 --> 51:57.289
So why didn't you tell me?
You're just gonna retire?

51:57.448 --> 51:58.495
And then what?

51:58.657 --> 52:00.751
Open up a bed-and-breakfast with the kid?

52:01.702 --> 52:04.000
This is not a life you just choose to leave.

52:04.413 --> 52:05.540
Mary, you know that.

52:06.874 --> 52:09.377
The old man's not gonna let you
just walk out of here.

52:09.543 --> 52:12.388
Besides, you know too much.
You'd be a liability.

52:14.340 --> 52:16.968
He's telling you what you wanna hear.
Always has.

52:17.134 --> 52:19.057
What is it you're pretending
not to understand?

52:23.766 --> 52:25.359
Wake up.

52:26.060 --> 52:27.187
No one leaves.

55:23.320 --> 55:24.367
Where's Luka?

55:25.364 --> 55:26.616
Wrong answer.

55:38.335 --> 55:40.963
- I'm okay.
- Slow down, Mary.

55:42.673 --> 55:43.891
Would you just slow down?

55:44.049 --> 55:46.052
- Goddamn it.
- Stop.

55:46.218 --> 55:49.313
I'm not your responsibility no more, okay?

56:00.023 --> 56:03.072
We got them, Pop. Message delivered.

56:03.569 --> 56:05.412
- Where's Mary?
- She took a hit, but...

56:05.571 --> 56:07.198
- She took a hit?
- Yeah. She's fine.

56:07.364 --> 56:09.287
Well, where the hell is she?

56:09.783 --> 56:12.286
- She didn't want help.
- She didn't want your help.

56:12.452 --> 56:16.707
- Wasn't for me, she'd be dead right now.
- If it wasn't for you, she'd be here.

56:16.874 --> 56:18.296
- I'm not losing her.
- Think I want her to leave?

56:18.458 --> 56:20.552
- I don't know what you want.
- Well, I don't.

56:21.879 --> 56:24.382
Which is why you gotta know about the kid.

56:25.299 --> 56:27.552
What about the kid?

57:01.710 --> 57:03.804
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

57:06.089 --> 57:07.136
Just a scrape.

57:07.716 --> 57:09.138
It's fine, honey.

57:09.301 --> 57:10.928
It's just a scratch, okay?

57:11.094 --> 57:12.846
- You okay?
- Go back to bed. It's okay.

57:13.013 --> 57:14.231
Go back to bed.

57:14.389 --> 57:17.393
I just need to lay down for a minute, okay?

57:20.187 --> 57:22.941
Mary. What you need? Can I get you something?

57:24.191 --> 57:25.818
I just need to lay down and close my eyes...

57:25.984 --> 57:28.487
...for a couple of minutes, baby. That's all.

57:32.032 --> 57:34.456
When you're better, we'll go, right?

57:35.160 --> 57:36.457
We'll get out of here?

57:38.538 --> 57:40.757
Go somewhere far away, like you said?

57:46.755 --> 57:48.132
Tom was right.

57:49.925 --> 57:51.723
He ain't never gonna let me go.

57:53.261 --> 57:56.106
- I tried.
- Well, try again. That's bullshit, Mary.

58:01.436 --> 58:02.858
I tried.

59:19.014 --> 59:20.607
Danny?

59:31.943 --> 59:33.536
Danny?

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.447
I'm here to see Benny.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.950
Here to see Benny? Who the hell are you?

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:21.619
Danny.

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:24.129
- Friend of Mary's.
- All right. Hold on, man.

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:28.379
Yeah.

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:32.634
I got this kid here to see Benny.
Said he's a friend of Mary's.

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:34.548
Name's Danny.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:38.097
- Yeah.
- Tell him it's Danny Boy.

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.058
Danny Boy.

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:41.855
Yeah. No, he's alone.

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:43.811
All right.

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:45.979
Go ahead.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:30.444
Danny Boy.

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:33.615
Where's Mary?

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.283
I came alone.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:38.286
How is she? Tom says she was hurt.

01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:41.365
She's gonna be fine.

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.625
That's good.

01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:46.161
Something on your mind?

01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:52.880
Danny?

01:01:57.005 --> 01:01:58.132
You gotta let her go.

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:05.013
And I know Tom said
you're never gonna, but...

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:08.729
...you gotta.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:11.896
Danny, these are family matters.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:16.863
It's better you avoid getting mixed up
in something...

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:19.904
- ...you don't understand.
- I understand fine.

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:22.531
Okay?

01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:24.290
I mean, I'm not, like...

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.918
...stupid or nothing.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:31.172
Well, now that I know
you're not stupid or nothing...

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.174
...this is what you're gonna do.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:37.091
You're gonna run back home and tell Mary...

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:39.180
...that I would like to see her.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.225
And that if she's hurt...

01:02:42.384 --> 01:02:45.513
...we'll arrange for her
to receive proper medical treatment.

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:49.225
I don't think so.

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:51.731
Oh, you don't?

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.317
No.

01:02:56.648 --> 01:02:58.150
I don't.

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:02.867
She doesn't work for you anymore.

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:05.453
You're a brave boy.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.247
I see that.

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:11.337
But you're making a mistake.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.923
I'm gonna tell you a story, Danny.

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:21.849
Let's see. I guess it was about a year ago.

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:25.102
I sent Mary on a contract in Jamaica Plain.

01:03:26.428 --> 01:03:29.432
This particular mark was a bookie...

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:32.191
...who was in debt for over $100,000.

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:38.611
Marcus Miller.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:43.867
- You're lying.
- Mary didn't find you, Danny Miller.

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:47.032
She was following you.

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:48.416
- You're lying.
- Really?

01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:51.541
None of this sounds familiar?

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:55.836
I thought so.

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:59.428
You're upset. It's understandable.

01:04:00.879 --> 01:04:03.052
But put the gun down.

01:04:09.637 --> 01:04:13.232
Now, you can put it down on the floor...

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.979
...or I can come and take it from you.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.239
It's okay. I understand.

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:27.030
I love Mary too. We all love Mary.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.870
But she's not who you think she is.

01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:34.667
She's only looking after you...

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:36.331
...because she feels guilty.

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:40.593
And why shouldn't she?

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:43.046
She made you an orphan.

01:05:02.107 --> 01:05:03.199
Hey.

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:05.952
- Everything is gonna...
- Let him go.

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:11.040
Go get in the car.

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:13.744
Go.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:20.751
Tom says you were hurt.

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:23.879
- You don't look well.
- Put the gun down.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:38.356
Danny and I are getting out of here.

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:40.649
So I see.

01:05:40.812 --> 01:05:42.655
Yeah, my debt to you is paid.

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:44.782
Your debt?

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.244
I took care of you. Gave you a family.

01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:51.373
- Was like a father to you.
- Is that what you tell yourself?

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:53.283
I taught you to survive.

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:56.545
Yeah, well, it's time for me to move on now.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:01.383
Mary, baby.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.632
You're acting crazy. Stop it.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:07.551
You know how much I love you.

01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:10.846
Well, if you love me...

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:13.098
...Benny, let me go.

01:06:14.762 --> 01:06:16.230
Please let me go.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.023
No.

01:06:23.938 --> 01:06:25.690
You ungrateful bitch.

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:29.027
Debt?

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:31.238
You don't owe me a debt.

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:34.915
I own you.

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:37.751
And you're not going anywhere.

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:41.874
You're gonna stay in the family
and work for me.

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:47.342
And you will train Danny
to work for the family...

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.723
...just like I trained you.

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:52.516
If you leave...

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:56.221
...we will find you and the boy.

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:58.523
So you see?

01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:01.272
You're not going anywhere.

01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:05.188
Now...

01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:07.823
...look at me...

01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:10.447
...and tell me that you understand.

01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:17.788
Mary...

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:21.254
...I need you to look at me...

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.915
...and tell me you understand.

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:31.260
I understand.

01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:22.314
Of course.

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:39.032
- Where is he?
- Upstairs in his office.

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:41.660
- Cops know yet?
- No, not yet.

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:44.500
Shut this place down. No calls in or out.

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:47.549
- Nobody talks to nobody.
- You got it, Tom.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.343
- Give me a second.
- Everybody out.

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:15.368
- Tom.
- Not now.

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:18.701
Sorry, boss, but I think
you're gonna wanna hear this.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.240
Jerome.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:21.908
Get in here.

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:26.917
Tell him what you saw.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.502
- A kid.
- What kid?

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:30.792
One of Uncle's boys.

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:34.429
I was outside,
unloading the last of the containers...

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:37.432
...and I seen this kid come
into the warehouse.

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.011
He talked to Rick and Maurice.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:41.473
Maurice made a call
and let him come upstairs.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.265
And?

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:46.433
About 10 minutes later,
all of a sudden I see this kid...

01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:49.227
...come running down
like the place was on fire.

01:09:49.394 --> 01:09:50.816
You sure?

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:52.104
Yeah.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:54.444
Pulled a gun on me once.

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:01.038
And he was alone?

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:03.495
Yeah, as far as I could tell.

01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:05.577
Yeah, okay.

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.213
Hey.

01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:03.434
So it's true what Benny said?

01:11:05.052 --> 01:11:06.645
About my father.

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:08.272
Danny...

01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:11.067
...there's not a moment...

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:15.902
...of my life that I don't regret that hit
on your father.

01:11:16.063 --> 01:11:19.408
Mom left that son of a bitch
when I was seven.

01:11:21.569 --> 01:11:24.448
The only thing she forgot to take was me.

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:27.826
She forgot to take me.

01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:34.882
But he said you're only
taking care of me out of guilt.

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:36.793
No, that's not true.

01:11:41.589 --> 01:11:44.513
All right, maybe it was at first.

01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:46.097
But it's not now.

01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:48.016
You lied to me.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.057
I mean, you don't care about me.

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:52.521
- I do.
- No, you don't.

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:54.686
Danny, I do. I care about you, okay?

01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:56.320
That's why I found you.

01:11:58.022 --> 01:11:59.399
How?

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:04.737
How'd you find me?

01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:07.908
A photo from your house...

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:10.247
...from that day.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:16.587
I saw you too.

01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:23.552
So I asked around...

01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:26.513
...and eventually, I found out
you were one of Uncle's boys.

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.891
So I started watching you.

01:12:34.809 --> 01:12:38.029
I didn't know
how I was gonna approach you, so...

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:40.986
...that day, when I saw you in the...

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:43.697
In the alley, hurt...

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:49.791
I can understand if you hate me, Danny.

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:53.912
I can understand if you want me dead.

01:12:55.788 --> 01:12:57.756
But they're gonna come after you.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:02.966
They're gonna come after you.

01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:06.808
You gotta let me fix this, okay?

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.769
We gotta go. Come on.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:17.985
All right. Stay in the car.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:20.192
If you see anyone, hit the horn three times.

01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:21.572
- Got it?
- I got it.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:23.616
Be back.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.156
Shit!

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:39.021
- Where you going?
- Hey! Get your hands off me.

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:41.402
- Calm. Calm down.
- Mary!

01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:44.693
<i>I got the kid.</i>

01:14:44.855 --> 01:14:46.482
Says she's expecting us.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:47.821
<i>I'm sure she is.</i>

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:50.829
Bring him here. We got what she wants.

01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:53.322
Let her come get him.

01:15:10.798 --> 01:15:13.301
What I'm having a hard time believing...

01:15:13.801 --> 01:15:16.020
...is you walked in here...

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:18.101
...and killed him alone.

01:15:20.057 --> 01:15:21.684
Look at me!

01:15:23.394 --> 01:15:25.818
I didn't kill your old man.

01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:30.572
- You asshole.
- Yeah.

01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:33.238
I was afraid of that.

01:15:33.404 --> 01:15:35.077
Take him upstairs.

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:37.333
Make sure he stays there.

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:40.373
Let's go, kid.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.880
- She's still coming for me.
- Come on.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:45.007
- She's still coming for me.
- Move. Shut up.

01:15:52.339 --> 01:15:53.591
Damn.

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:01.641
Tom, that bitch is acting
like she done lost her goddamn mind.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:05.277
I want every man we got
at every entrance to this place.

01:16:08.856 --> 01:16:10.278
Let's go! Let's go!

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:34.562
Mary.

01:19:37.398 --> 01:19:38.945
You really fucked up.

01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:03.140
<i>Where is he?</i>

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:12.024
You okay?

01:20:13.017 --> 01:20:14.860
You killed Uncle.

01:20:15.019 --> 01:20:19.400
I asked myself, "Why would you
do something so stupid?"

01:20:24.194 --> 01:20:27.448
Tom, I'm leaving out of here,
and I'm taking the kid.

01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:28.866
I can't let that happen.

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:32.662
Come on, Tom.

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:34.296
He didn't do anything.

01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:36.632
Let him go.

01:20:37.207 --> 01:20:39.631
We can settle this without hurting the kid.

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:43.472
Danny.

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:46.471
I want you to get up and run out of here...

01:20:46.633 --> 01:20:48.761
- Not without you.
- Don't do it, kid. Stay where you are.

01:20:48.927 --> 01:20:50.850
I said, get up and go.

01:20:51.722 --> 01:20:53.395
- Go!
- Sit down!

01:20:54.141 --> 01:20:57.065
- I'll do it. I swear, I will.
- No, you won't, Tom.

01:20:57.227 --> 01:20:58.604
You and I both know you can't.

01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:02.236
Listen to me.

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:04.527
I need you to hear me.
I'm only gonna say this once.

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:07.655
I'm walking out of here,
I'm gonna find Danny...

01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:10.199
...and I'm leaving. I'm never coming back.

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:13.165
So if you wanna stop me,
you gonna have to kill me.

01:21:13.327 --> 01:21:15.330
If it weren't for this family...

01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:16.918
...your family, Mary...

01:21:17.081 --> 01:21:19.175
...the old man taking you off the streets...

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:22.553
...you'd be a guttersnipe
servicing cabbies for smack.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:25.385
News flash, Mary:
You ain't the mothering type.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:29.510
You're pathetic.

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:34.432
Don't turn your back on me.

01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:37.310
Do not walk away from me.

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:40.646
I will drop you, Mary!

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:54.786
News flash, asshole:

01:21:55.869 --> 01:21:57.792
I am the mothering type.

01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:19.230
Danny?

01:22:23.313 --> 01:22:24.815
Danny?

01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:31.200
Danny!

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:35.580
Danny!

01:22:36.326 --> 01:22:38.499
Danny!

01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:51.642
Danny...

01:24:02.412 --> 01:24:05.962
- What the hell happened to the door?
- I did that saving your ass.

01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:09.219
- Well, you took your damn sweet time.
- Hey, your mouth.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:15.434
So where we going?

01:24:15.592 --> 01:24:17.310
Anywhere you want to, kid.

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:19.563
How about someplace warm and nice?

01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:22.100
Now, I like that.

01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:23.859
Let's do it.

01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:25.481
Buckle up.

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.237
You buckle up.

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:30.241
- We ain't even got a damn door.
- Hey, your mouth.

01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:32.072
I'm gonna buckle up those lips.

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:34.995
Let's get out of here.
