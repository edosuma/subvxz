WEBVTT

01:09.903 --> 01:10.904
No!

03:44.433 --> 03:48.061
You're not allowed in Mum's room.
Seriously, if she catches you--

03:48.145 --> 03:50.522
-I'll just blame you.
-No change there then.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.608
Should we try it on?

03:52.691 --> 03:56.195
Firstly, I'm not seven years old anymore.
And second, I've got a list.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.988
-A what?
-A list, with timings.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.865
You should be in the shower.
We're behind schedule.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.658
I've been up for an hour
watching you sleep.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.202
-That's because you have jet lag.
-No.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.078
It's called
being pushed out of bed all night

04:05.162 --> 04:06.663
by your pointy-elbowed hobbit sister.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.333
You didn't have to bring me back
from New York, did you?

04:09.416 --> 04:11.460
-Where's her engagement ring?
-I don't know.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.546
Maybe she started wearing it again.
Come on. We need to get a move on.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.714
What are you doing in here?

04:16.798 --> 04:20.469
-Mum, where's your engagement ring?
-You concentrate on your wedding.

04:20.552 --> 04:21.845
Do you know what time it is?

04:21.928 --> 04:24.056
-See?
-And grow up, the pair of you.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.641
One of you needs to get in the shower

04:25.724 --> 04:27.601
before you start arguing
about that and all.

04:34.483 --> 04:35.734
Hey!

04:36.360 --> 04:37.361
Come on!

04:38.070 --> 04:39.738
Sorry. Thanks.

04:44.201 --> 04:47.412
Come on. Daisy, hurry up.

04:47.496 --> 04:50.415
-Have you seen this?
-We're both late. Come on.

04:50.499 --> 04:54.795
It's the Royal family. Well, the Queen,
Prince Charles, William, Kate.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.339
-It's sick!
-Can I have my phone back now, please?

04:58.340 --> 05:00.676
I thought you might have
gotten me a phone from New York.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.511
-I got you a gift.
-You got me a snow globe.

05:03.846 --> 05:07.099
Which is cool. But in this digital age,
there's only a certain amount you can do

05:07.182 --> 05:08.183
with a snow globe.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.061
Look, I know you're almost
as tall as me, but you're 11.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.021
-Exactly.
-Exactly!

05:14.773 --> 05:17.651
How was staying at Dad's at the weekend?
Did you miss me?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.695
I had a lot of homework to do, so…

05:21.154 --> 05:22.573
Well, I missed you.

05:24.908 --> 05:25.951
What?

05:26.869 --> 05:29.454
-I forgot my homework.
-If you're joking, that's not funny.

05:29.538 --> 05:32.207
And if I'm not? Still not funny?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.043
Okay.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.257
Right, don't worry. You go in.
I'll email the teacher or something.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.800
-Okay? Sort it.
-Okay.

05:42.759 --> 05:43.927
Thank you.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.977
-I did miss you.
-Go on.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.355
Shit.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.358
-Yo. Usain Bolt.
-Yeah, I thought you'd be gone.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.859
Yeah. I bet you did.

06:41.527 --> 06:43.820
-Lunch.
-Cheers, sis.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.113
Good run?

06:45.989 --> 06:48.825
Dad's a bit behind. He was asking
if you're going in with him today.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.619
I'm not a carpet salesman.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.080
He's been asking you to look at
the computer system for weeks.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.748
Yeah, but you know I'm waiting on a call.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.959
That's why they're called mobiles, Aadesh.
They go with you.

06:57.042 --> 07:00.003
Well, it's too noisy at the warehouse.
I need to sound professional.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.590
It's good that he wants your help.

07:04.216 --> 07:07.052
It's bad enough having to live with them
without having to work with them as well.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.263
Hey, man.
Coming to do a proper day's work?

07:12.057 --> 07:14.685
-I just need a shower.
-That's all right. The boys will wait.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.257
Hey, Scott. Glad you could make it.
Follow me.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.676
I know it's a rush,
but we're playing catch-up here.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.894
-You up to speed?
-Yeah.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.395
Young guy, Leo Newman,

07:58.478 --> 08:01.315
gets packed into a suitcase
by a masked gang.

08:01.398 --> 08:06.236
This film dropped on Go Leak,
and NYPD flags four suspects, all Brits.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.406
Well, we get a few hours max
before the film goes viral.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.201
-Demands?
-Not yet.

08:13.744 --> 08:16.038
-Cybercrime?
-Same.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.416
Look. Whoever took him left his cell phone
smashed in the stairwell

08:19.499 --> 08:20.501
and not a lot else.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.420
I'm waiting on an update
from the Brits on the suspects.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.464
So, when do we extradite?

08:26.423 --> 08:27.508
When I get evidence.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.801
Private elevator. Penthouse suite.

08:29.885 --> 08:33.388
If you want me to catch the next flight,
I gotta be at JFK in an hour.

08:33.472 --> 08:35.349
So, what is this exactly?

09:07.923 --> 09:12.594
Sorry, guys. I know it was me who asked
if we could bring this forward.

09:12.678 --> 09:16.849
I can never get to sleep on flights,
so I'm blaming jet lag.

09:20.853 --> 09:23.605
-Heather, you're late.
-So are you.

09:24.815 --> 09:27.067
True, but I apologized.

09:27.150 --> 09:30.362
I'm happy to apologize,
if you don't mind it not being sincere.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.030
Most people don't.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.035
Right. Let's get started, shall we?

09:40.455 --> 09:43.417
You know, Nora cannot be on
the same table as your Uncle Ray.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.585
-Yes.
-It's fine.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.212
I've checked the table plan,
and the venue has a copy.

09:47.296 --> 09:50.549
Mum, I'm still not comfortable
with you paying for the whole reception.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.551
It's a budget hotel in Peckham.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.845
It's not like the fancy places
you two stay in.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.514
If Nora's son sees Ray,

09:57.598 --> 09:59.391
-there will be a fight.
-I'm on it, Mum.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.768
He already stutters.
Don't want to make it any worse.

10:01.852 --> 10:02.853
Make yourself useful.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.813
Phone the car company
and reconfirm the times.

10:04.897 --> 10:06.440
Isn't it me who's supposed to be stressed?

10:06.523 --> 10:07.774
Yes!

10:07.858 --> 10:09.026
What's this?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.820
Some fool being packed
into a suitcase. No one sent it to you?

10:12.988 --> 10:15.157
-That's mine.
-Whoa!

10:15.741 --> 10:17.075
That'll be your Aunt Rose.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.663
God knows what the royal family
have got to do with it.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.502
Today, I want to talk about the crowd mind

10:26.585 --> 10:30.756
and how the impression of the universality
of behavior can influence people.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.802
We've seen experiments
in which even the wisest individuals,

10:35.886 --> 10:38.764
once part of a group, act irrationally.

10:38.847 --> 10:42.851
And when we look at Germany in the 1930s,
what we begin to see happening--

10:44.394 --> 10:48.982
Something amusing you, Heather?
Something inherently funny about Nazism?

10:50.150 --> 10:51.151
No.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.111
What then?

10:54.112 --> 10:56.490
Camilla getting stuffed into a suitcase
by the Queen.

10:57.032 --> 10:59.451
The same video my 11-year-old
was giggling at.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.162
What can I say? It's the crowd mind.

11:02.246 --> 11:05.249
-Everybody's trying to copy it now.
-Define everybody.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.419
You're social psychologists. I'm asking.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.340
Would you be interested in that video
if nobody else was?

11:13.423 --> 11:16.009
What ascribes meaning
to something culturally?

11:19.596 --> 11:21.974
I hope you're enjoying
today's flight from New York.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.935
We'll have an update
on the UK weather for you soon.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.354
But in the meantime,
please do stay in your seats

11:27.437 --> 11:28.647
and fasten your seat belts…

11:28.730 --> 11:31.316
Excuse me. Excuse me.

11:33.485 --> 11:36.780
Why don't you just leave the bottle?
Then I won't have to keep shouting.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.782
It's fine, sir. That's what I'm here for.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.785
-I know when I've had enough.
-Sorry, sir. I'm not allowed to--

11:41.869 --> 11:43.579
What? Think for yourself?

11:44.872 --> 11:47.207
I can top up your glass again
when you've finished.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.585
Excuse me!

11:52.337 --> 11:54.965
What have you got to do
to get some service on this plane?

11:56.842 --> 11:58.468
I'll just keep shouting, shall I?

12:02.723 --> 12:06.310
Hey, pal. Why don't you just chill out?

12:06.393 --> 12:09.229
Why don't you just chill out… pal?

12:21.700 --> 12:23.410
-Look at me.
-Yeah. Yep.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.541
-Are you gonna chill out?
-Yeah. It's all good.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.593
Thanks. Yeah.

13:04.910 --> 13:06.411
You watch that thing I sent you?

13:07.538 --> 13:10.207
That's crazy, man.
Is that kidnap video for real?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.209
What video? Why didn't I get it?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.711
-Have you fixed the computer?
-It's not broken.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.588
It's just old and slow.

13:16.672 --> 13:17.840
Yeah, like Dad.

13:19.383 --> 13:20.717
So, you fixed it then?

13:21.802 --> 13:23.387
Nearly. What video?

13:23.470 --> 13:26.765
Hey. Hey, I asked your dad
to log off at night.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.809
-Yeah, he does.
-No. No, he couldn't have.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.811
-I do.
-Yeah, but then who's…

13:30.894 --> 13:33.522
-Where's my tea?
-…who's doing this?

13:34.565 --> 13:35.732
What the--

13:37.401 --> 13:39.069
-You fix it?
-No, it's not broken.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.822
-So, you fixed it?
-Yeah, I'm working on it.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.490
You need a company shirt.

13:43.574 --> 13:44.783
No, I really don't.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.952
Is that video you sent a prank?

13:50.372 --> 13:51.874
Do I at least get a cup of tea?

13:57.087 --> 14:01.383
Kashco Carpets. Yes. He was actually
doing some work for a change.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.551
What's it about?

14:03.844 --> 14:04.845
It's for you.

14:06.555 --> 14:07.973
Sounds important.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.020
Hello, Aadesh Chopra speaking.

14:13.729 --> 14:15.355
Why is there no money
in our current account?

14:16.231 --> 14:17.316
Not now, Son.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.860
I checked online.
Thought it was a mistake, but it's not.

14:19.943 --> 14:22.779
There's a payment
to a travel company for £400.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.616
Why did you do that?
You know I take care of the finances.

14:25.699 --> 14:26.950
What's going on, Aadesh?

14:28.410 --> 14:31.121
Just-- Nothing.
I just had to move some money around.

14:31.205 --> 14:33.874
-All right? It's all fine.
-You're hiding something.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.375
Why won't you let your phone
out of your sight?

14:35.459 --> 14:37.544
-I told you.
-What was the money for?

14:37.628 --> 14:39.880
-What?
-The money you paid to the travel company.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.926
Listen, when I get home tonight,
we'll talk.

14:44.009 --> 14:47.012
-I want to talk now.
-I'm trying to fix your dad's computer!

14:49.181 --> 14:50.724
I thought you said it wasn't broken.

15:07.241 --> 15:08.242
Scott.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.955
Katherine Newman,
Special Agent Scott Anderson.

15:13.038 --> 15:14.039
Hello.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.750
Scott heads up our VCMO squad.

15:16.834 --> 15:20.212
He's got years of experience in kidnap,
abduction and extortion cases.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.214
If anyone can find your son, it's him.

15:24.341 --> 15:25.592
I'll leave you to it.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.973
I have a call with the White House
in one hour.

15:32.307 --> 15:33.684
And still,

15:33.767 --> 15:37.062
you're the most important person
I'll speak to all day.

15:38.772 --> 15:39.982
You know I'm about to--

15:40.065 --> 15:42.109
Leave for London? I know.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.736
And I know you're gonna find out
who these people are

15:44.820 --> 15:46.321
and bring Leo back to me.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.785
So I'm guessing they've already
spoken to you about potential enemies.

15:51.869 --> 15:54.997
I would call it the skeleton test.
We ask our clients,

15:55.080 --> 15:57.708
"Who would you least like to see
talking about you on TV?"

15:58.500 --> 16:00.460
So, are there any Brits on your list?

16:00.544 --> 16:02.838
Do you know
what strategic communication is,

16:02.921 --> 16:04.173
Special Agent Anderson?

16:04.715 --> 16:06.758
High-end public relations.

16:06.842 --> 16:12.055
We construct a version of reality that's
usually at odds with someone else's.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.767
Make a lot of friends,
meet a lot of people,

16:15.851 --> 16:17.186
most of whom hate you.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.605
And then there are the enemies.

16:20.689 --> 16:22.608
So you're saying
I might need a bigger notebook.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.735
Even just for London.

16:26.445 --> 16:29.823
And what about Leo?
He studied at Oxford, right?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.997
I know your guys chose
a different picture to put out,

16:37.080 --> 16:38.540
and I have to trust you now.

16:39.750 --> 16:40.751
But…

16:43.921 --> 16:45.589
this one's my favorite.

16:59.561 --> 17:00.812
Why were you late?

17:01.355 --> 17:03.649
It's nothing personal.
I'm late for everything.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.068
In fact, I usually make an effort for you.

17:06.151 --> 17:07.319
Where are you from, Heather?

17:07.986 --> 17:09.738
-Manchester.
-Specifically.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.824
A shithole in South Manchester.
What do you care?

17:12.906 --> 17:14.284
That's my question.

17:17.996 --> 17:22.251
There are 30 of them
for every one of you, at least.

17:22.835 --> 17:25.796
People who think they belong here
just because they're alive.

17:25.877 --> 17:26.964
People who already think

17:27.047 --> 17:30.300
somebody from South Manchester
has no ability and no business being here.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.886
And your only achievement so far
is to prove them right.

17:33.762 --> 17:36.557
Now if you're too scared
to prove them wrong,

17:36.640 --> 17:39.142
at least be honest about it
and piss off back where you came from

17:39.226 --> 17:42.938
because you are a liability to those of us
who have staked everything on this.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.034
Your accent comes out when you're angry.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.016
Where's Mum?

18:19.099 --> 18:20.309
Mum?

18:21.935 --> 18:24.563
-I'm just gonna put this out.
-What-- In your dress?

18:24.646 --> 18:26.773
-You can't move in there.
-I'll take it.

18:27.691 --> 18:28.692
Drink.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.028
Keep pouring. Keep pouring. There you go.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.882
Right. Let's make a toast.

18:52.466 --> 18:55.552
To my big girl on her big day.

18:57.137 --> 19:00.516
And to absent friends. To Dad.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.393
-Cheers, everyone.
-Cheers.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.563
Come with me.

19:06.647 --> 19:09.358
I never get used to this.
Bubbles always go up my nose.

19:10.359 --> 19:11.360
What's this?

19:12.277 --> 19:14.279
I've been waiting to give this to you.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.784
-Will you wear it today?
-Your engagement ring.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.537
I've had it reset and resized
in Hatton Garden.

19:21.620 --> 19:23.413
Man said he's done work for the Queen.

19:24.498 --> 19:26.792
It's beautiful, Mum. But…

19:28.669 --> 19:29.711
how much did it cost?

19:31.171 --> 19:34.383
I'm sorry. It's just, you've paid
for the reception as well.

19:34.466 --> 19:36.718
-Where did you get the money from?
-None of your business.

19:36.802 --> 19:39.304
But it is though, isn't it?
Or at least it will be.

19:39.388 --> 19:42.599
-I know you can't afford it.
-This is your wedding day.

19:42.683 --> 19:45.060
And I want you to have everything
that you would have had

19:45.143 --> 19:46.395
if your father was alive.

19:46.478 --> 19:49.022
And I am grateful, Mum. I am, but--

19:49.106 --> 19:50.107
Please.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.193
Let me do this.

19:55.070 --> 19:59.074
Something old and something new.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.368
See?

20:07.875 --> 20:09.126
Okay.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.879
Let's get started.
We've got a lot to get through.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.298
And given our subject,

20:14.381 --> 20:18.093
I don't expect to have to tell people
to pay full attention this afternoon.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.555
So let's talk about motivation.

20:26.351 --> 20:29.980
What are the impulses
that drive us to act the way we do?

20:30.063 --> 20:32.983
What are the needs
that we're seeking to satisfy?

20:33.066 --> 20:34.443
Are you Tara McAllister?

20:35.485 --> 20:36.778
Yes.

20:36.862 --> 20:38.113
Thames Valley Police.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.742
Daisy?

20:41.825 --> 20:44.411
No. We need you to come with us, please.

20:46.205 --> 20:48.165
-Why?
-Please.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.583
What is this?

20:49.666 --> 20:52.794
We can discuss that here
or somewhere more private.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.550
Is that your laptop?

20:59.885 --> 21:00.886
Yeah.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.055
Thank you.

21:25.661 --> 21:27.412
Where'd she get the money from, Mon?

21:28.163 --> 21:29.331
Maybe she sold something.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.041
-What?
-I don't know.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.669
But it makes her happy
to give us things. You know that.

21:35.629 --> 21:37.506
I haven't taken this off
since she gave it to me,

21:37.589 --> 21:40.175
-the day I left for America.
-It's her mother's.

21:40.259 --> 21:43.679
She's resourceful, Nat.
She's had to be, so stop worrying.

21:44.805 --> 21:46.139
What?

21:46.640 --> 21:48.100
Mum's call from Aunt Rose.

21:48.642 --> 21:50.894
She's never called
a mobile phone in her life.

21:50.978 --> 21:52.938
-Well--
-She's too mean to even call a landline

21:53.021 --> 21:54.731
-during the day.
-Okay, listen.

21:54.815 --> 21:56.149
Here's what's going to happen now:

21:56.233 --> 21:58.569
I'm gonna shower,
and you're gonna get changed.

22:00.279 --> 22:01.280
Agreed?

23:18.065 --> 23:19.399
Who the hell are you?

23:19.483 --> 23:20.609
-Drive.
-What?

23:20.692 --> 23:21.902
Drive, man!

23:23.111 --> 23:25.155
I'm her daughter. I'm here to sort this.

23:25.239 --> 23:27.115
How much does she owe?

23:27.199 --> 23:28.492
Two.

23:29.368 --> 23:30.369
K?

23:32.412 --> 23:34.081
I'll get your money.

23:35.207 --> 23:37.251
I'm gonna tell you where to drop me, okay?

23:37.793 --> 23:38.794
Are you listening?

23:39.962 --> 23:41.797
-What's up?
-We're being followed.

23:45.551 --> 23:47.177
-Are you sure?
-No, but I'm on parole.

23:47.261 --> 23:49.304
-I don't need to be sure.
-You think it's the police?

23:49.388 --> 23:52.182
-Should we stop and go ask them?
-I cannot get arrested, not today.

23:52.266 --> 23:53.684
No one's getting arrested.

24:01.400 --> 24:02.568
Shit!

24:04.987 --> 24:07.114
I can't die today either!

24:08.282 --> 24:11.493
Now we know the real reason
Harry and Meghan quit the Royal Family.

24:11.577 --> 24:13.829
They didn't wanna be implicated
with the rest of the family

24:13.912 --> 24:17.165
in whatever the hell is going on in
this viral video everyone's talking about.

24:17.791 --> 24:21.795
The other theory is the chap being packed
into the suitcase is the actual dude

24:21.879 --> 24:24.214
who introduced the Duke and Duchess
of Sussex in the first place.

24:24.298 --> 24:25.632
Shit!

24:29.303 --> 24:32.389
What are you doing here?
I told you we'd talk later.

24:33.849 --> 24:35.225
Why'd you go to America?

24:36.143 --> 24:39.104
Don't make it worse by lying, Aadesh.
I found your boarding pass.

24:39.188 --> 24:41.106
You said you was in Birmingham
seeing your family,

24:41.190 --> 24:42.983
but you were in New York. Why?

24:45.903 --> 24:47.029
I was gonna tell you.

24:47.112 --> 24:49.114
-You having an affair?
-An af--

24:49.698 --> 24:51.241
What? No.

24:53.327 --> 24:55.954
You know I've been pitching
to a few blue-chip clients,

24:56.038 --> 24:57.748
bespoke cybersecurity.

24:58.582 --> 24:59.875
Well, one of them bit.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.836
I told them I work
in America sometimes and--

25:02.920 --> 25:05.506
-But you don't.
-Yeah, but they invited me

25:05.589 --> 25:07.174
to meet them in New York.

25:09.927 --> 25:12.304
I didn't wanna tell you
'cause I thought you'd try to stop me.

25:12.387 --> 25:13.722
You'd say we can't afford it.

25:13.805 --> 25:15.516
-We can't afford it.
-That's the point, Son.

25:15.599 --> 25:18.101
If we carry on like this,
we're never gonna be able to afford it.

25:18.185 --> 25:20.270
No, the point is
our bank account is empty.

25:20.354 --> 25:24.483
The clients I've got here
don't have the budgets.

25:25.275 --> 25:27.986
We need to be more ambitious.

25:28.070 --> 25:29.905
And the meeting, it went well!

25:29.988 --> 25:32.366
They say they'd pay
for my travel expenses.

25:33.283 --> 25:36.328
They wanna call to talk more.
That's why I can't leave my phone.

25:40.165 --> 25:41.333
I'm sorry.

25:41.917 --> 25:43.961
All right? I'm sorry that I lied to you.

25:45.045 --> 25:47.965
But I can't apologize
for wanting more than this.

25:48.841 --> 25:51.385
For you, for the baby.

25:51.468 --> 25:53.470
-There is no baby.
-Yeah, but there will be soon

25:53.554 --> 25:54.847
like we talked about, right?

25:59.601 --> 26:01.436
-If you're lying to me now--
-I'm not.

26:02.563 --> 26:03.897
All right? I'm not.

26:35.971 --> 26:38.640
It's cool, Mum. I'm talking to her now.

26:38.724 --> 26:40.809
Hi, you've reached Natalie.
Leave a message.

26:41.393 --> 26:42.477
Where the hell are you?

26:42.561 --> 26:45.189
We're due in church in an hour
and your dress is still on the hanger.

26:45.272 --> 26:46.273
Call!

27:00.829 --> 27:01.830
Joe?

27:04.291 --> 27:07.211
-Joe? Joe!
-Wait, wait.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.087
Nat?

27:11.089 --> 27:12.049
What are you doing here?

27:12.132 --> 27:13.884
Thought it was bad luck
to see you before the church.

27:13.967 --> 27:15.594
Exactly, so stay where you are.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.639
-Has something happened?
-I just forgot something that's all.

27:18.722 --> 27:21.475
-I could've sent someone over there.
-It's… personal.

27:21.558 --> 27:23.852
Have you got your dress on?
Has she got her dress on?

27:23.936 --> 27:24.937
No, no, she hasn't.

27:25.020 --> 27:28.398
I'll be quick. And I've still got
some of Mon's stuff from New York,

27:28.482 --> 27:31.360
and we're not gonna come back here
between the reception and the honeymoon.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.987
Okay. Well, hold on.
We were ready to leave for the church.

27:34.071 --> 27:37.032
Well, in the old days,
the bride's parents were scared

27:37.115 --> 27:38.659
the groom would change his mind

27:38.742 --> 27:41.870
if he saw the bride
before he put a ring on it.

27:41.954 --> 27:44.248
That's why you can't see me.
Mum looked it up.

27:44.331 --> 27:48.585
That's the reason for the veil as well,
making it too late for you to back out.

27:48.669 --> 27:51.338
Nothing is gonna stop me
from marrying you, Nat.

27:51.421 --> 27:52.840
Are you sure everything's all right?

27:54.174 --> 27:55.926
That's the worst thing
about living with a lawyer,

27:56.009 --> 27:57.511
you're always suspicious.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.559
-What was that?
-Nothing!

28:04.226 --> 28:06.979
It-- It was Mon!

28:09.273 --> 28:11.567
Go back to the lounge. I'm coming out now.

28:12.776 --> 28:14.820
-Okay.
-And, Joe?

28:15.529 --> 28:16.655
Yeah?

28:18.031 --> 28:20.742
-I love you.
-Love you too.

28:27.958 --> 28:29.251
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:29.334 --> 28:32.713
we hope you've enjoyed this flight
from New York to Belfast International.

28:32.796 --> 28:34.423
We will shortly be starting our descent,

28:34.506 --> 28:37.593
so please ensure your seat belts
are fastened, your tray tables are stowed,

28:37.676 --> 28:40.554
and seats are returned
to the upright position. Thank you.

29:06.538 --> 29:08.498
Wow, sis. You look almost female.

29:08.582 --> 29:10.250
Where have you been?

29:11.210 --> 29:12.377
Something blue.

29:12.461 --> 29:15.422
I knew that it was at home,
but I just couldn't find it anywhere.

29:15.506 --> 29:16.507
Are you serious?

29:16.590 --> 29:18.842
And the clothes you left in my case
from New York.

29:18.926 --> 29:20.719
Have you lost your mind?

29:20.802 --> 29:22.221
Everything's sorted now, Mum.

29:22.304 --> 29:25.224
-There's no phone signal at your flat?
-What does your list say, Mon?

29:25.307 --> 29:27.476
Shall we stand here and argue,
or shall I go get changed?

29:27.559 --> 29:29.686
-Get changed!
-Get changed!

29:46.620 --> 29:48.205
My apologies, ladies and gentlemen,

29:48.288 --> 29:50.541
but I'm being told we have
a change of gate,

29:50.624 --> 29:52.876
which means there will be a short delay.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.670
Bear with us,
and please remain in your seats

29:54.753 --> 29:57.506
with your seat belts fastened
until the aircraft arrives at the gate.

29:57.589 --> 29:58.715
Thank you.

30:15.732 --> 30:17.109
Excuse me. Hey.

30:22.531 --> 30:23.782
-Hey.
-Hi.

30:24.658 --> 30:27.661
I am sorry, but I'm not feeling great,

30:27.744 --> 30:30.581
so… can I use the bathroom?

30:30.664 --> 30:32.583
I'm afraid the toilets
have to stay locked now.

30:32.666 --> 30:34.376
Yeah, I know, but…

30:37.337 --> 30:38.755
please?

30:41.717 --> 30:42.718
Okay.

30:52.436 --> 30:53.896
-There you are.
-Thank you.

32:06.051 --> 32:09.096
Okay? We need to bring everything
out of our seats.

32:09.179 --> 32:11.640
Okay? And Auntie Julie's so excited.

32:12.891 --> 32:16.270
-So sorry.
-We need to get all of our bags…

32:16.353 --> 32:20.482
-Hey. Can I help you?
-…I didn't sleep good during the flight.

32:21.441 --> 32:22.860
-Thank you.
-Yep.

32:22.943 --> 32:25.404
Okay, Ronan. Let's go.

32:28.240 --> 32:33.036
And finally, it's the viral video
everyone's been talking about.

32:33.120 --> 32:36.123
-An unknown figure…
-You fixed the computer then, Aadesh?

32:36.206 --> 32:39.084
It wasn't actually--
Yeah, yeah, I fixed it.

32:39.168 --> 32:42.462
You see? I told you.
He isn't a complete waste of space.

32:42.546 --> 32:44.173
He needs a company shirt.

32:44.256 --> 32:45.757
He really doesn't, Mum.

32:45.841 --> 32:47.718
-I'm gonna turn that down.
-Why?

32:47.801 --> 32:51.263
We're expecting an important call.
I mean, Aadesh. A business call, so…

32:51.346 --> 32:53.390
This time tomorrow
you're gonna be a millionaire, right?

32:54.975 --> 32:57.477
-I'll get it.
-Maybe that's the major investors now,

32:57.561 --> 32:59.605
here to make Aadesh
an offer he can't refuse.

33:03.317 --> 33:04.318
Aadesh Chopra?

33:06.862 --> 33:08.322
Metropolitan Police.

33:09.406 --> 33:11.325
We're gonna need you
to come with us, please.

33:19.208 --> 33:21.084
It's a long flight. You know?

33:21.168 --> 33:23.629
It's like--
Especially for Ronan, it's too much.

33:23.712 --> 33:25.964
You know, I need some real coffee.

33:26.048 --> 33:28.717
You know, like, actually,
like ground coffee beans.

33:29.301 --> 33:33.889
Not sort of that instant stuff that
they sort of chuck at you every few hours.

33:33.972 --> 33:35.891
Just like I need some actual sleep.

34:06.421 --> 34:07.798
Best be wearing that garter.

34:08.674 --> 34:11.385
-Something borrowed?
-Yep, got that covered.

34:11.467 --> 34:12.636
Girls?

34:20.893 --> 34:23.063
Come on then. Let's do this.

35:08.692 --> 35:10.235
Natalie Thompson.

35:11.028 --> 35:13.739
-What's going on? Joe!
-Who the hell are you?

35:13.822 --> 35:16.783
Apologies for the timing, but I'm afraid
you're gonna have to come with us.

35:16.867 --> 35:17.868
What is this about?

35:17.951 --> 35:18.952
What?

35:19.036 --> 35:20.329
Don't make this any harder, sir.

35:20.412 --> 35:21.496
-Are you joking?
-Okay, Natalie?

35:21.580 --> 35:23.332
-What's happening?
-Take your hands off me!

35:23.415 --> 35:24.958
-She's not going anywhere!
-You have to come with me now.

35:25.042 --> 35:27.211
-Joe!
-You can't do that!

35:30.005 --> 35:31.423
Please stay back.

35:32.049 --> 35:39.014
It's so hard to break a habit
Ooh

35:42.100 --> 35:44.561
Tried to move on
But got motion sick

35:44.645 --> 35:47.272
It's hard to forget
When the dark days hit

35:47.356 --> 35:50.025
It's cruel
Remember the things I didn't do

35:50.108 --> 35:52.819
-And a dark day hits once more
-It's so

35:52.903 --> 35:56.281
In disbelief at the depth of the skies

35:56.365 --> 35:58.408
Can't open my eyes

35:58.492 --> 36:01.370
Nothing holdin' me down
Yet there's weight inside

36:01.453 --> 36:03.914
-Reminds me I'm actually sinking
-It's so

36:03.997 --> 36:07.125
I've been thinking 'bout the future

36:07.209 --> 36:09.211
Feelin' things I didn't used to

36:09.294 --> 36:11.839
I was free, not before

36:12.464 --> 36:14.091
Natalie!

36:14.174 --> 36:18.887
But after my fall
Free to believe in words I didn't mean

36:18.971 --> 36:23.517
Just to get by
I'd rather die than to cry

36:24.309 --> 36:27.688
-It's a hard life
-It's a hard life

36:27.771 --> 36:32.025
Yeah, it's a hard life

36:40.117 --> 36:41.451
We're gonna go to immigration.

36:41.535 --> 36:43.537
That's where they stamp the passport,
remember?

36:43.620 --> 36:46.039
So you get different stamps
for different countries.

36:46.123 --> 36:47.833
We're really into collecting that.

36:47.916 --> 36:50.752
Thing is, I work, actually,
as an executive coach,

36:50.836 --> 36:52.045
-as a life coach.
-Uh-huh.

36:52.129 --> 36:55.340
I realized that my marriage--
Well, that's in the past now, but…

36:57.467 --> 37:00.429
…disconnected, because I find that
in our world it's all about, like,

37:00.512 --> 37:02.097
everyone's constantly available.

37:05.058 --> 37:07.311
But then her first message was,

37:07.394 --> 37:10.772
"I cannot believe someone let their kid
come to school with a cold."

37:10.856 --> 37:12.524
And I was like, are you kidding me?
Have you never--

37:13.525 --> 37:18.113
Passport time. Ronan, so come to Mommy.
Say thanks to this gentleman. Thank you.

37:18.197 --> 37:19.364
Yeah. Hey.

37:20.616 --> 37:22.075
Next, please.

37:23.410 --> 37:25.245
Where are you going on to today?

37:32.044 --> 37:38.550
Sean Tilson. Armed police.
Unlock the door very slowly, Mr. Tilson.

37:38.634 --> 37:40.219
Thank you very much.

37:40.302 --> 37:41.803
-Hey, that's for you.
-Got it.

37:41.887 --> 37:43.680
And you. I'll see you out there.

37:43.764 --> 37:44.765
Okay.

37:48.519 --> 37:51.563
-You together?
-Yes, but not married.

37:51.647 --> 37:54.983
Glad to get a break, to be honest.
You take as long as you like.

38:00.364 --> 38:02.449
-Take the glasses off, please.
-Sure.

38:19.049 --> 38:20.259
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

38:20.342 --> 38:21.385
Next.

38:24.513 --> 38:26.682
Armed police. Move.

38:27.641 --> 38:29.184
Come on. Out of the way.

39:50.307 --> 39:54.228
Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm so sorry.
I was just wondering if you could--

41:24.026 --> 41:26.153
My name is Vanessa Okoye.

41:26.236 --> 41:29.740
I'm a senior investigating officer
from the Anti Kidnap and Extortion Unit

41:29.823 --> 41:31.533
at the National Crime Agency.

41:32.034 --> 41:33.202
What's this about?

41:33.285 --> 41:36.163
I can tell you that you've been arrested
on suspicion of conspiracy

41:36.246 --> 41:40.542
to abduct Leo Newman
from the Park Madison Hotel in New York

41:40.626 --> 41:42.628
last Tuesday at 2:00 a.m.

41:42.711 --> 41:46.548
You're entitled to legal representation
during interview if you so choose.

41:46.632 --> 41:49.885
You can either give us your
representative's details, if you have one,

41:49.968 --> 41:52.971
or we can arrange for a duty solicitor
to offer legal advice

41:53.055 --> 41:55.015
and to be present during interview.

41:56.975 --> 41:58.310
What would you like to do?

42:47.359 --> 42:48.694
Ready to rock and roll?

42:54.199 --> 42:55.409
Ready.

42:55.492 --> 42:56.869
I'll be watching.
