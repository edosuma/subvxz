- Previously on <i> Good Witch...
- I saw you and Sam.</i>

00:03.300 --> 00:04.933
- Give me time.
- Of course.

00:04.969 --> 00:07.158
There were complications
with the patient and...

00:07.193 --> 00:08.993
- Sam.
- I couldn't save him.

00:09.018 --> 00:10.706
- Nick, this is...
- Courtney.

00:10.741 --> 00:12.975
- Courtney.
- Hey.

00:13.010 --> 00:14.888
Some mornings, right when I wake up,

00:14.913 --> 00:17.646
I realize I'm thinking
about Jake and I remember.

00:17.681 --> 00:20.149
- You lied to me?
- I was trying to protect you.

00:20.184 --> 00:24.653
You may have ruined my one chance
at reconnecting with my mother.

00:24.688 --> 00:28.824
When I woke up this morning,
I was thinking about you.

00:52.583 --> 00:54.026
Hello?

00:55.356 --> 00:58.020
You don't have to pick me up,
Brandon, I can just walk home.

00:58.055 --> 01:00.258
It's not that far.

01:01.058 --> 01:04.388
Okay, I'll look for you out front.

01:05.352 --> 01:08.030
I am going out for a bit.
Would you mind watching the store?

01:08.065 --> 01:09.681
- Sure.
- 'Kay.

01:19.143 --> 01:22.044
- Have you tried the Quadrivium?
- Excuse me?

01:22.079 --> 01:24.680
It's one of my favorite candles.

01:24.715 --> 01:27.583
It really helps when you have
a lot of thinking to do.

01:30.959 --> 01:33.222
Sounds like exactly what I need.

01:34.091 --> 01:36.458
- Thanks.
- Sure.

01:38.128 --> 01:40.128
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

01:40.164 --> 01:42.362
Oh, you look like you're in a hurry.
Where are you heading?

01:42.387 --> 01:44.014
Oh, just... out.

01:44.049 --> 01:46.898
- Oh. Well, enjoy "out."
- Hey,

01:46.934 --> 01:50.205
- these photos are really cool.
- Oh wow, yeah.

01:50.241 --> 01:52.874
I've never seen these before.
Are they new?

01:52.910 --> 01:55.560
Yeah, I just got them in today.

01:56.503 --> 01:58.833
I really liked how the photographer
captured nature

01:58.858 --> 02:00.582
from such a unique viewpoint.

02:02.207 --> 02:03.952
Life from a different perspective.

02:03.988 --> 02:06.352
Oh.

02:06.353 --> 02:08.100
_

02:08.125 --> 02:10.491
Uh, gotta run.

02:16.066 --> 02:19.342
I've got a place I need to be.
What time shall I be back?

02:19.367 --> 02:20.379
You've got a two o'clock

02:20.414 --> 02:22.141
and back-to-back
appointments after that.

02:22.166 --> 02:23.438
Better get moving.

02:24.141 --> 02:27.670
- Martha. Did you have an appointment?
- No, no, no.

02:27.705 --> 02:30.079
But I do need to see a physician at once.

02:30.104 --> 02:31.647
Someone's waiting to meet me.

02:31.682 --> 02:34.539
And I'm sure they won't mind
that you were tending to the mayor.

02:35.435 --> 02:38.754
- What seems to be the problem?
- Well, nothing too major, but I do get

02:38.789 --> 02:41.557
this odd, tingly feeling in my elbow

02:41.582 --> 02:43.792
every time I try to get
someone's attention by going...

02:43.827 --> 02:46.328
Yoo-hoo! Oh, look,
there it is right there.

02:46.363 --> 02:49.265
I know it's probably nothing. I just
want to hear it from a doctor.

02:49.301 --> 02:53.135
- I think I can do a quick exam.
- I feel better already.

03:11.522 --> 03:16.714
- Hello, Sam.
- Hi. Beautiful.

03:16.770 --> 03:19.461
Yeah, the Middleton Botanical
Gardens are very enchanting.

03:19.496 --> 03:24.051
Not talking about
the gardens. Sorry I'm late.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.515
I had a patient who was just,
um, desperate to see me.

03:27.550 --> 03:31.986
- Well, I'm glad you could make it out.
- Yeah, me too.

03:33.704 --> 03:37.825
Whoops. I didn't mean
to break up the party.

03:37.860 --> 03:40.528
That's okay, the party can move.

03:40.563 --> 03:43.264
Martha asked me to do some
plant care here at the garden.

03:43.299 --> 03:45.479
I wanted to get started
in the midday sun.

03:45.504 --> 03:48.102
We should get out of your way.

03:48.137 --> 03:50.838
- What is this?
- That's the Middleton Merriwick.

03:50.873 --> 03:52.046
The one and only.

03:52.071 --> 03:53.914
I figured you would've come
out to see it.

03:54.127 --> 03:56.633
I'm not really a "wander
through the garden" kind of guy.

03:56.658 --> 03:59.062
Everybody who lives here
knows about the Merriwick.

03:59.097 --> 04:01.082
That plant is very important
to our town.

04:01.117 --> 04:04.542
I like that I live in a town
that has an important plant.

04:04.567 --> 04:06.020
The flower on that thing,

04:06.055 --> 04:08.923
when it blooms... absolutely amazing.

04:08.958 --> 04:11.292
It's only bloomed 3 or 4
times since Elizabeth Merriwick

04:11.317 --> 04:13.257
planted it over 150 years ago.

04:13.744 --> 04:15.504
But when it does,

04:15.529 --> 04:18.565
wonderful and magical things
happen throughout Middleton.

04:19.389 --> 04:21.202
All because of a plant.

04:21.237 --> 04:24.138
Not just a plant. That's the Merriwick.

04:25.112 --> 04:28.442
- When's it supposed to bloom again?
- No one ever knows.

04:28.478 --> 04:31.479
But you can tell when
it's about to by how green the leaves get

04:31.514 --> 04:36.650
- and how tall the stalk shoots up.
- It looks pretty tall to me.

04:36.686 --> 04:39.928
Those leaves are about
as green as they can get.

04:41.124 --> 04:45.760
- Would you look at that.
- What are we looking at?

04:45.795 --> 04:48.129
The last time, just before
this plant bloomed,

04:48.164 --> 04:51.065
the Merriwick looked exactly like that.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.160
I remember because I was...

04:53.636 --> 04:58.239
- I was a little younger.
- So, what does that mean for now?

04:58.274 --> 05:02.510
This is the year
the Merriwick blooms again.

05:12.579 --> 05:20.449
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

05:34.278 --> 05:36.378
Did you hear the news?

05:36.414 --> 05:38.580
About the Middleton Merriwick? I know!

05:38.616 --> 05:40.471
It's exactly the shot
in the arm that this

05:40.496 --> 05:41.750
town needs so that everyone knows

05:41.786 --> 05:44.319
this could be one of our best years yet.

05:44.355 --> 05:46.255
I heard that one year, when it bloomed,

05:46.290 --> 05:48.257
there was a rainbow that lasted
for seven days in a row.

05:48.292 --> 05:51.560
That might be a rumor, but
no one can say it didn't happen,

05:51.595 --> 05:54.129
so who knows what that flower
might inspire this time?

05:54.165 --> 05:56.498
Well, I'm just excited
we all get to see it.

05:56.534 --> 05:58.801
Oh, Chief Sanders. Did we get

05:58.836 --> 06:01.437
those "Home of the Middleton
Merriwick" stickers in yet?

06:01.472 --> 06:03.272
I'm picking them up from the printers.

06:03.307 --> 06:06.211
Make sure and put one on every
traffic ticket you hand out.

06:06.246 --> 06:08.277
Wait, you're putting stickers
on traffic tickets?

06:08.312 --> 06:11.280
- To get the word out, yes.
- So right after someone hears,

06:11.315 --> 06:14.249
"Do you know how fast you were
going?" they'll be in the mood

06:14.285 --> 06:16.952
to learn about one of the best
things this town has to offer?

06:16.987 --> 06:20.361
Oh, perhaps I didn't think
this through carefully enough.

06:20.396 --> 06:23.459
You know what? Put a hold on
those stickers until I come up

06:23.494 --> 06:26.295
- with a better idea.
- Yes, Ma'am.

06:26.330 --> 06:29.298
I just want to document the
Merriwick for all of posterity.

06:29.333 --> 06:32.167
It's been known to all of us
here, but this is our big chance

06:32.203 --> 06:35.103
- to let the whole world know.
- I'll make sure and mention it

06:35.139 --> 06:37.806
to anyone who looks like
they're from out of town.

06:37.842 --> 06:40.309
Ooh, point out that one
of the first times it bloomed,

06:40.344 --> 06:43.278
marriage proposals in Middleton
tripled the following year.

06:43.314 --> 06:47.115
- Is that really true?
- Maybe. That's what they tell me.

06:48.804 --> 06:52.020
She could be the one.
Don't let him get away!

06:59.870 --> 07:01.237
Welcome to Grey House.

07:01.273 --> 07:03.662
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

07:03.697 --> 07:06.705
I was just admiring
your beautiful landscape.

07:06.705 --> 07:10.674
You know, I've never seen an apical bud
so large on top of a dichotomous plant.

07:10.709 --> 07:12.970
You sound like a woman who knows
her way around a garden.

07:12.995 --> 07:14.077
I'm a botanist.

07:14.112 --> 07:15.979
- Oh.
- I like to say that out loud

07:16.014 --> 07:18.475
so my parents know they didn't waste
their money on my degree.

07:18.510 --> 07:22.185
- I'm Cassie Nightingale.
- Daphne Randall. Nice to meet you.

07:22.221 --> 07:25.255
- Oh yes, I have your reservation.
- Thank you. You know,

07:25.290 --> 07:27.657
I've been hearing all of this
talk about some rare plant

07:27.693 --> 07:30.393
- here in town that's about to bloom.
- The Middleton Merriwick.

07:30.429 --> 07:33.786
Oh. I didn't realize
it already had a name.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.594
Well, it's more traditional
than phytological.

07:37.236 --> 07:39.936
Interesting. You know, the university

07:39.972 --> 07:42.672
sent me here to verify the plant
and I just can't wait

07:42.708 --> 07:44.650
to get to the Gardens
to determine its species.

07:44.675 --> 07:46.479
Then I should set you up with our mayor.

07:46.514 --> 07:49.379
She is very eager to show
people what's special about her town.

07:49.414 --> 07:51.548
And I'm just as eager to document what,

07:51.583 --> 07:54.048
as far as I can tell,
nobody's ever documented before.

07:54.488 --> 07:57.687
So this could be the chance
to make a name for yourself.

07:58.399 --> 08:01.308
Which would mean that degree
of mine was worth every cent.

08:01.694 --> 08:04.223
- Let me show you to your room.
- Thank you.

08:23.181 --> 08:27.317
- Can I help you?
- Yes. Do you have any flowers?

08:27.352 --> 08:29.920
Hm! Now, are they
for that special someone

08:29.955 --> 08:32.489
- in your life?
- They're for Cassie.

08:32.524 --> 08:35.491
Well, I guess this means
you two are officially a thing.

08:36.159 --> 08:37.739
Yeah, I guess we are.

08:37.764 --> 08:39.763
Although we haven't made any big
announcement.

08:39.798 --> 08:42.030
Well, I'll be sure
to keep it to myself, then.

08:42.056 --> 08:43.400
It's not exactly a secret.

08:43.434 --> 08:46.044
Hm, you never know
who has or hasn't heard.

08:46.576 --> 08:47.737
Why don't I pick out

08:47.773 --> 08:51.041
a big bouquet that Cassie can put
right in the middle of her kitchen?

08:51.076 --> 08:52.673
Sounds perfect.

08:52.698 --> 08:56.103
I'm always here to give
people exactly what they need.

09:00.902 --> 09:03.286
Wait, our school has a photography club?

09:03.322 --> 09:05.789
Yeah, and I'm thinking about joining.

09:05.824 --> 09:09.793
They give you a camera and let you
take pictures of whatever you want.

09:09.828 --> 09:11.761
Do you get out of class to do it?

09:11.797 --> 09:15.165
- I don't think so.
- Then I don't see the appeal.

09:15.200 --> 09:19.536
- Mm-mm.
- Hey.

09:19.571 --> 09:21.138
- Oh, hey.
- Where you headed?

09:21.173 --> 09:24.541
- Home.
- But mine is that way, so...

09:24.576 --> 09:27.010
I'll see you later. Bye. Bye.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.946
So, what did you guys do all day?

09:29.982 --> 09:33.483
School. Then walking home from school.

09:33.518 --> 09:35.952
Then running into you
walking home from school.

09:35.988 --> 09:37.941
Except we stopped at the park
because Courtney

09:37.966 --> 09:40.457
wanted to hang upside
down on the jungle gym.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.176
- Just for fun?
- Yeah.

09:42.201 --> 09:43.833
It looked like she was having fun,

09:43.868 --> 09:47.831
although her face was upside down so it
was very hard to tell if she was smiling.

09:47.866 --> 09:50.934
Maybe the next time you guys go there,
we could all meet up.

09:50.959 --> 09:52.175
Of course.

09:52.210 --> 09:55.105
Oh, hey, I've got
a biology test coming up.

09:55.130 --> 09:56.706
Do you think you could
help me study for it?

09:56.742 --> 09:57.761
Wait.

09:59.418 --> 10:01.551
Are you feeling okay?

10:01.576 --> 10:04.814
Nick Radford actually wants to study?

10:04.850 --> 10:08.752
Yes. I actually decided
I want to know stuff, alright?

10:08.787 --> 10:11.254
Yes. Okay, tomorrow,

10:11.289 --> 10:14.391
- after school, at the Bistro?
- That's where I'll be.

10:16.628 --> 10:19.307
The Middleton Botanical
Gardens are known

10:19.332 --> 10:21.131
for their breathtaking
floral collections.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.246
I wasn't aware there
was so much variety here.

10:23.271 --> 10:24.475
Oh yes, we like to think

10:24.511 --> 10:27.537
we have some of the best-kept secrets
in the state, not the least of which

10:27.572 --> 10:30.406
is right over here where
you can find... Cassie!

10:30.441 --> 10:32.842
- Oh, Martha. Daphne.
- Hi.

10:32.878 --> 10:34.359
I was just telling Ms. Randall

10:34.384 --> 10:36.146
about the natural wonders
of these surroundings.

10:36.181 --> 10:38.209
- Isn't it lovely?
- It's beautiful.

10:38.234 --> 10:39.310
I like to come here

10:39.345 --> 10:42.886
for inspiration. I especially get
inspired standing right here.

10:43.763 --> 10:47.357
- Is this the Merriwick?
- Named after Cassie's ancestors.

10:47.754 --> 10:49.893
I didn't know you and
the plant were connected.

10:50.235 --> 10:52.095
In a spiritual sense, very much so.

10:52.130 --> 10:53.889
But there are plenty
of others who feed off

10:53.914 --> 10:55.632
the energy
of the Merriwick just as much.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.301
That's why it's so important
to all of us.

10:58.336 --> 11:02.939
A sense of community is deeply
rooted here in Middleton.

11:02.974 --> 11:05.775
- Can I take a closer look?
- Oh, please. Be our guest.

11:05.811 --> 11:08.111
I do love being able
to get right up close.

11:08.146 --> 11:11.081
Where the plant's aura is strongest.

11:14.847 --> 11:16.753
Is there another plant
like this in the gardens?

11:16.788 --> 11:19.489
No. It lives on its own,
separate from all the rest.

11:20.190 --> 11:21.925
I've never seen anything like it.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.743
So many things in this
town are very unique.

11:24.768 --> 11:25.895
No, but this...

11:25.931 --> 11:29.933
this is more than that.
I suspect it might be sui generis.

11:31.770 --> 11:34.170
There might not be another one
like it on earth.

11:34.206 --> 11:37.703
Then I can see why
you're so interested in it.

11:37.738 --> 11:40.944
Isn't this spectacular, Cassie?
Just think, right here in Middleton

11:40.979 --> 11:44.347
we have something that is almost
certainly one-of-a-kind!

11:48.887 --> 11:51.610
These flowers are beautiful.
Thank you, Sam.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.623
I just wanted you to know
I was thinking about you.

11:53.658 --> 11:57.160
It's nice to know. And I just
happen to be washing these vases,

11:57.195 --> 11:59.596
so I have the perfect one picked out.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.965
Abigail says they can go right
in the middle of the kitchen.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.893
I'm afraid they'll get
knocked over there.

12:03.918 --> 12:05.268
I'll put them in the sun room.

12:05.303 --> 12:09.672
- The sun room it is, then.
- I'll be right back.

12:11.910 --> 12:16.446
- Oh, wow! Who are those from?
- Me.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.150
So you show up with flowers now?

12:20.807 --> 12:23.653
I just wanted to surprise your mom.

12:25.090 --> 12:26.990
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey.

12:27.025 --> 12:30.693
This guy is an expert on
the Middleton Merriwick now.

12:30.729 --> 12:33.329
I bumped into him and your mom
down at the Gardens.

12:33.365 --> 12:35.235
Gave him a little history lesson.

12:37.380 --> 12:40.443
You guys went to the Gardens together?

12:41.228 --> 12:44.307
Oops. Was that supposed to be a secret?

12:44.964 --> 12:47.143
Not exactly a secret.

13:04.832 --> 13:07.613
So how much longer are you
going to stand out there?

13:07.638 --> 13:13.165
I was waiting to find
the right time to knock.

13:13.595 --> 13:17.769
- Can I come in?
- The door's open.

13:19.618 --> 13:20.472
So...

13:20.507 --> 13:23.593
This whole "you and Sam" thing
is moving forward, huh?

13:23.618 --> 13:24.776
Faster than I thought.

13:24.812 --> 13:26.179
Yeah. You and me both.

13:27.792 --> 13:30.615
Last time we talked, you said you
needed time to think about it.

13:31.451 --> 13:34.353
Yeah, which is why

13:34.388 --> 13:36.688
it would've been nice to have
been told there was a ticking clock

13:36.724 --> 13:40.684
before the two of you
started... ticking.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.129
I had been meaning
to find the right time

13:44.164 --> 13:46.698
to ask you how you felt about all this.

13:46.734 --> 13:51.436
- So I guess the right time is now, huh?
- Seems like it.

13:53.507 --> 13:57.275
So, how do you feel about all this?

13:59.546 --> 14:03.215
I feel fine. I mean, I really like Sam,

14:03.250 --> 14:06.495
and I see how happy
he makes you. It's just...

14:07.965 --> 14:09.221
Go ahead.

14:10.151 --> 14:13.358
It's just, everything
has been "you and I"

14:13.735 --> 14:17.562
for so long, and now
it's going to be more...

14:18.671 --> 14:20.465
crowded than that.

14:21.263 --> 14:22.801
My life

14:22.836 --> 14:25.537
will never be too crowded for you.

14:25.943 --> 14:27.806
I know that.

14:28.359 --> 14:30.509
I just wish you would have
told me first.

14:31.182 --> 14:34.012
Because now it just feels like
I'm the last to find out.

14:35.682 --> 14:38.517
Even though I... think
I probably already knew.

14:38.552 --> 14:42.554
I should have known. There's
really no secrets in this house.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.490
But now everything is out in the open.

14:47.561 --> 14:50.395
Hey, those flowers were
very pretty that he got you.

14:50.934 --> 14:53.398
He has very good taste.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.867
He does.

15:11.919 --> 15:14.619
It's gonna be any day now.

15:14.655 --> 15:19.257
That flower is looking more ready to open
than a jar of jam on Sunday morning.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.081
It's hard to tell.

15:22.019 --> 15:25.367
I've been doing readings,
and checking the pH balance, but...

15:25.402 --> 15:28.733
You can check anything you want.
I'm just telling you what I know.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.303
You must be one of the gardeners here.

15:31.338 --> 15:35.207
- I show up when they need me.
- I'm from the university.

15:35.242 --> 15:37.776
They sent you out here
to dig in the dirt?

15:37.811 --> 15:40.926
They sent me here to study
botanical science.

15:40.962 --> 15:44.449
Well, the Merriwick doesn't
seem to care much about science.

15:44.931 --> 15:49.362
- She just opens up when she wants to.
- Oh.

15:49.398 --> 15:51.590
I didn't know anyone else was here.

15:51.625 --> 15:55.327
Just a gardener and a scientist
and now this town's very own

15:55.362 --> 15:58.130
flower shop owner, which makes you
the third expert out of three.

15:58.165 --> 16:01.233
That's me. Abigail the flower shop girl.

16:01.908 --> 16:04.640
Can you tell me anything about
the other Middleton plant life?

16:04.675 --> 16:07.557
I'm not quite the expert
George thinks I am.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.919
I've been trying to grow
potted plants at my shop

16:09.944 --> 16:11.243
to sell and I don't seem to have

16:11.278 --> 16:14.294
one of those... green thumbs.

16:14.917 --> 16:16.848
Are you looking for something?

16:16.884 --> 16:20.119
What? No. Just ideas.

16:20.695 --> 16:22.652
That's why I come here. Flower ideas.

16:23.484 --> 16:26.155
You must be as eager as I am
to see this one bloom.

16:27.007 --> 16:29.425
Yeah, I hear it's stunning.

16:29.460 --> 16:31.560
Maybe I can grow something just like it.

16:34.169 --> 16:35.526
Anyway, it was nice to meet you.

16:35.551 --> 16:38.124
- Nice to meet you.
- George, I'll see you.

16:39.771 --> 16:41.300
I should get back to work.

16:41.325 --> 16:43.863
- All right. Good luck.
- Thanks.

16:52.350 --> 16:56.252
What are the distinguishing
characteristics of a eukaryotic cell?

16:57.117 --> 17:00.256
- A you-carry-a-what-now?
- Eukaryotic.

17:00.291 --> 17:03.793
- It's a kind of cell.
- There's no way that's a word.

17:03.828 --> 17:07.630
- You're making that up.
- No, no. It is right here in the book.

17:07.665 --> 17:09.719
- Let me see.
- No peeking.

17:09.743 --> 17:11.252
Come on, let me see that!

17:11.287 --> 17:13.868
No, no, no, no. You are
supposed to know this.

17:13.905 --> 17:17.772
I'd know it if you gave me
that book, Grace!

17:18.976 --> 17:20.853
No.

17:21.876 --> 17:23.813
Fine, I give up.

17:23.848 --> 17:26.214
Good. Now.

17:26.250 --> 17:28.884
The nucleus and the organelles

17:28.920 --> 17:31.520
are enclosed in a membrane.

17:32.253 --> 17:34.056
Oh, okay,

17:34.092 --> 17:37.827
so it's like "Eukary" them
inside something else.

17:37.862 --> 17:41.564
Yes. Yeah, that is
a great way to remember it.

17:42.166 --> 17:44.867
It's 'cause I've got
the best teacher in town.

17:44.902 --> 17:46.346
Aw.

17:48.298 --> 17:50.740
Well, thanks for all the learning.

17:51.976 --> 17:55.244
I'll try to remember to thank
you during my graduation speech.

17:55.279 --> 17:57.286
Oh no, no, you'd better,

17:57.311 --> 18:00.216
since I'll be the one speaking
right after you're done.

18:00.251 --> 18:03.853
- Bye, Grace.
- Bye.

18:05.890 --> 18:07.890
- So...
- Hi.

18:07.925 --> 18:09.859
What's going on with you and Nick?

18:09.894 --> 18:12.561
Oh, nothing. We were just studying.

18:12.597 --> 18:16.532
- Uh-huh...
- What, "Uh-huh"?

18:16.567 --> 18:18.868
It's just that he practically
had his arm all the way

18:18.903 --> 18:21.412
around you, and then I saw him
acting all sweet.

18:21.448 --> 18:24.540
What? No. That is Nick just being Nick.

18:24.575 --> 18:27.676
- Well, I'll say it
again: uh-huh.

18:27.712 --> 18:29.779
There's nothing going on
between me and him!

18:29.814 --> 18:34.283
Okay. Just make sure to let me know
when the two of you start dating.

18:40.057 --> 18:42.935
Okay, here's a lollipop.
See you next time.

18:44.455 --> 18:46.862
Oh, Cassie. I'll let
Sam know you're here.

18:46.898 --> 18:50.366
Oh, except I came here
to bring something to you. - Oh.

18:50.401 --> 18:52.902
It's Malabathrum,
grown in northern India.

18:52.937 --> 18:56.572
Mmm!

18:56.607 --> 19:01.310
Oh, smells like cinnamon.
And I love cinnamon.

19:01.345 --> 19:03.411
It makes a great tea, very soothing.

19:03.436 --> 19:05.915
But when you drink it, tell people
it's Malabathrum...

19:05.950 --> 19:07.841
keeps them guessing.

19:07.866 --> 19:10.032
How did you know
I would like something like this?

19:10.068 --> 19:12.655
I thought it'd be something you
could keep here in the office,

19:12.690 --> 19:15.658
for those days when nothing
seems to be going right.

19:17.751 --> 19:21.230
- Hey. What are you doing here?
- She brought me some Malabathrum.

19:21.265 --> 19:23.614
That's "cinnamon tea" if you
were going to try to guess.

19:23.639 --> 19:24.618
I wasn't.

19:24.653 --> 19:25.947
Well, you never would have.

19:26.579 --> 19:28.671
You know, before there
were doctors like you,

19:28.706 --> 19:31.140
people used cinnamon
as an anti-inflammatory.

19:31.175 --> 19:34.810
Well, now that there are doctors
like me, it goes much better on toast.

19:35.130 --> 19:38.848
- What's next?
- You have a patient in exam room two.

19:38.883 --> 19:42.591
No matter what I do, people just
keep appearing in exam room two.

19:42.626 --> 19:46.223
- Then I better let you get in there.
- Thanks for stopping by.

19:47.471 --> 19:49.792
She actually came by
to bring me some tea.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.328
Well, then I'm glad
my assistant likes tea.

19:56.968 --> 19:58.355
I'll see you later.

19:58.380 --> 20:01.060
- Say hi to your mom for me.
- Yeah.

20:04.263 --> 20:06.345
Is everything okay?

20:07.178 --> 20:10.980
Uh... Nick just sent me a text.

20:11.015 --> 20:15.518
"Need to ask you something
important. Tomorrow okay?"

20:17.188 --> 20:20.890
You were right.
Nick is going to ask me out.

20:20.925 --> 20:23.459
Mm-hmm.

20:35.891 --> 20:39.156
- What are you making?
- Just something for dinner.

20:39.157 --> 20:42.125
Oh! - You okay? - Yeah, it didn't cut.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.716
Let me do that.

20:43.741 --> 20:45.261
- No, I've got it.
- Let me.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.290
Oh, I called the plumber, by the way.

20:48.325 --> 20:49.645
I said I was gonna call him.

20:49.670 --> 20:51.401
Yeah, but I know you
don't like having to deal

20:51.436 --> 20:53.870
with that kind of thing,
so now you don't have to.

20:53.905 --> 20:58.575
- You can stop acting this way.
- I'm acting? What?

20:58.610 --> 21:02.745
I already told you I forgive you.
For telling me that my mom didn't call

21:02.781 --> 21:06.216
when she really was trying to get in touch
with me. So you, acting like this

21:06.251 --> 21:09.192
and doing this... You don't have to.

21:09.227 --> 21:11.254
I just want you to know
that things are different.

21:11.289 --> 21:14.257
Yeah. They're way different.

21:14.292 --> 21:16.761
And now we just have
to figure out how to live

21:16.786 --> 21:18.085
with how different things are.

21:32.110 --> 21:33.751
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

21:33.786 --> 21:38.314
- Um, I wanna ask you something.
- Sure.

21:38.350 --> 21:41.993
I know it's been a long time
since you were my age, but...

21:42.028 --> 21:45.288
I'll try to remember back that far.

21:46.720 --> 21:48.958
There's this girl that I want to ask out

21:48.994 --> 21:51.828
and I'm trying to figure out
exactly what to say.

21:51.863 --> 21:54.524
A girl, huh? Who is she?

21:55.127 --> 21:57.500
I'm going to wait 'til after she says

21:57.536 --> 22:00.470
- yes to make that public.
- Of course she'll say yes.

22:00.505 --> 22:03.132
I mean, what girl could resist
the Radford charms?

22:04.060 --> 22:06.133
So far? Most of them.

22:06.169 --> 22:09.136
Speak for yourself. I might be
a little old fashioned,

22:09.172 --> 22:12.006
but I always like to buy flowers
and show up with them.

22:12.041 --> 22:15.309
Nobody buys flowers when all
you're doing is asking them out.

22:15.345 --> 22:18.125
Okay, maybe I'm a little more
old fashioned than I thought.

22:18.150 --> 22:19.955
But there's not much to it, really.
You just say,

22:19.980 --> 22:22.149
"Hey, do you want to go somewhere
some time and do something?"

22:22.185 --> 22:25.152
Then just stand there and wait,
see if she says, "Sure."

22:25.188 --> 22:27.154
You just stand there?

22:27.190 --> 22:30.358
Well, it helps if you have
flowers, you can hide behind those.

22:31.092 --> 22:35.062
So I guess it might be worth
picking a few.

22:39.822 --> 22:43.504
- Oh. How are things with the Merriwick?
- Still waiting for it to bloom.

22:43.539 --> 22:46.407
But you can't rush Mother Nature.

22:46.442 --> 22:49.020
Since when have you become a shutterbug?

22:49.055 --> 22:50.949
- What?
- The camera.

22:50.974 --> 22:54.548
Oh, I joined the photography
club at school.

22:54.584 --> 22:57.351
Well, don't forget your
grandpa if you need a model.

22:57.387 --> 23:00.221
The camera loves me.

23:00.256 --> 23:04.781
- Hey, so... how'd it go with Nick?
- What?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.871
- Studying.
- Oh.

23:06.907 --> 23:10.364
Yeah. Right. Good.

23:12.568 --> 23:14.057
Well, everything's almost done here.

23:14.082 --> 23:17.005
- You and Grace want to finish up?
- Sure.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.740
And I wanna see some of
those pictures you're taking.

23:19.776 --> 23:22.963
- When they're ready, yes.
- Okay.

23:29.252 --> 23:32.720
So... you want to talk

23:32.755 --> 23:35.523
- about something?
- I think I do.

23:35.558 --> 23:38.225
- It's a boy, isn't it?
- How did you know?

23:38.885 --> 23:42.229
Men are attracted to Merriwicks.
It's our blessing and our curse.

23:42.265 --> 23:44.425
It's mostly a blessing.

23:44.450 --> 23:46.500
Although thereare a few that I have
literally cursed.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.680
It's just, I can't talk with Mom

23:48.705 --> 23:50.705
about this because she and Sam
are dating,

23:50.740 --> 23:53.037
so it's weird to be thinking

23:53.062 --> 23:55.810
that my mom's boyfriend's son
is about to ask me out.

23:55.845 --> 23:58.412
Hang on, I need to follow
the genealogy here.

23:58.448 --> 24:01.033
Your mom's boyfriend's...

24:01.068 --> 24:04.185
- Nick is gonna ask you out?
- Yeah. Tomorrow.

24:04.220 --> 24:08.089
Well, he knows a good thing
when he sees it. - Except...

24:08.124 --> 24:11.225
- You're not sure you want him to.
- I don't know. I mean,

24:11.260 --> 24:14.261
Nick and I are such great friends,
right, but what if we dated

24:14.297 --> 24:17.732
and things didn't work out?
That could ruin everything.

24:17.767 --> 24:20.568
So you're going to say no?

24:20.603 --> 24:23.938
I don't know what I'm going to say.

24:23.973 --> 24:28.542
Look, I've been asked out
by way too many men to count.

24:28.578 --> 24:32.813
And there's a few of them I actually
wanted to stay friends with.

24:32.849 --> 24:36.484
So what you have to do is,
before he gets to the asking,

24:36.519 --> 24:39.220
you start talking about what
a great friend he is to you,

24:39.255 --> 24:41.822
and then very smoothly
transition into listing

24:41.858 --> 24:44.258
all the things you're looking
for in a romantic partner,

24:44.293 --> 24:47.461
but make sure that
nothing applies to him

24:47.497 --> 24:49.663
like, totally the opposite of him

24:49.699 --> 24:53.334
and he'll start to realize
that he's not the guy for you.

24:53.369 --> 24:57.304
He'll back down and eventually he won't
even look at you that way ever again.

24:58.131 --> 25:00.408
Well, he'll keep
looking at you that way,

25:00.443 --> 25:02.810
but you just have to make sure
you never look back.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.246
And you think that'll work?

25:05.833 --> 25:07.415
Well, there's always the curse thing,

25:07.440 --> 25:09.183
but I don't think we want to turn Nick

25:09.218 --> 25:12.740
- into a frog, do we?
- I don't think so.

25:13.356 --> 25:16.857
- No.
- Come on, let's finish up.

25:16.893 --> 25:18.937
You should probably make the salad.

25:18.962 --> 25:21.395
I'm not sure I should be handling food.

25:21.431 --> 25:23.782
I have so much dirt stuck
under my fingernails.

25:23.817 --> 25:26.470
Let me see. Oh yeah, you're a mess.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.537
I lost one of my favorite
gardening gloves,

25:29.572 --> 25:32.339
which is frustrating because
that thing fit like...

25:32.375 --> 25:34.742
- A glove?
- A glove, yeah.

25:39.615 --> 25:42.550
Cassie, I'm so glad
you came by to visit.

25:42.585 --> 25:43.654
I need your advice.

25:43.679 --> 25:45.352
I just came by to return
this book you gave me,

25:45.388 --> 25:48.656
- but I'm always available to talk.
- I wanna take advantage

25:48.691 --> 25:51.392
of the Middleton Merriwick blooming,
but I don't know the best way

25:51.427 --> 25:54.261
- to let the public know that it's here.
- I'm sure

25:54.297 --> 25:56.797
you'll find the right way
to make sure it gets seen.

25:56.833 --> 25:59.398
Cassie, you always
have such confidence in me.

25:59.423 --> 26:01.368
Much more than I have in myself!

26:01.404 --> 26:06.240
Let's see. Goodness, I really should
organize these shelves someday. Ooh!

26:08.111 --> 26:09.910
Oh my, look at this.

26:10.605 --> 26:13.414
I haven't seen this book in ages.

26:13.449 --> 26:17.384
The state tourism committee
publishes this eye-catcher

26:17.420 --> 26:19.449
to showcase the plant life in this
region.

26:19.484 --> 26:21.832
I sell copies of it in my store.
It's very popular.

26:21.857 --> 26:24.391
Yes, and it brings oodles of attention

26:24.427 --> 26:27.361
to whatever town has its flora
featured on the cover.

26:28.461 --> 26:31.932
Cassie, what if this year
it could be our town?

26:31.968 --> 26:35.236
With the Merriwick about to bloom,
I'm sure we'd be a shoo-in to be

26:35.271 --> 26:37.375
the cover of the next edition!

26:37.400 --> 26:39.907
Which would be the perfect way
to make sure the public knows.

26:39.942 --> 26:43.860
What a fantastic idea!
I'm so glad I thought of it.

26:43.896 --> 26:47.314
I will call the committee
and get them to come out

26:47.350 --> 26:48.821
and see our flower

26:48.857 --> 26:53.361
- when it is finally in full bloom.
- And then we can prepare

26:53.397 --> 26:56.590
for Middleton's most wonderful
and magical year yet.

27:17.813 --> 27:20.581
Cassie, are you all right?

27:20.616 --> 27:23.264
I don't know. I just felt...

27:24.342 --> 27:27.154
I don't know.

27:34.450 --> 27:36.292
I came here this morning
to take some pictures

27:36.317 --> 27:37.773
like the ones I saw in your shop.

27:37.850 --> 27:41.337
Now, I was shooting some cool angles
on the ground right next to the Merriwick

27:41.338 --> 27:42.831
and I didn't even notice
that anything was wrong

27:42.856 --> 27:46.773
until I took a step back and saw...
that.

27:47.944 --> 27:49.371
Oh, my goodness!

27:49.396 --> 27:51.212
I know. Somebody took
a stem right off of it.

27:51.248 --> 27:53.664
Does this mean that the flower
isn't gonna bloom?

27:53.689 --> 27:55.656
It's hard to tell.

27:55.691 --> 27:57.361
It has to bloom, so we can get the cover

27:57.386 --> 27:59.254
of that book and have
a wonderful and magical year.

27:59.289 --> 28:01.952
Cassie, I need this year
to be wonderful and magical.

28:01.977 --> 28:03.725
Wonderful and magical!

28:03.760 --> 28:06.160
Now, I'm going to need to see
those photos that you took.

28:06.196 --> 28:09.063
I'm going to ask Chief Sanders
to open an investigation

28:09.099 --> 28:11.900
so we can find out who did this
and we can use your pictures as evidence.

28:11.935 --> 28:14.869
- Yeah. Of course.
- Is something wrong?

28:14.905 --> 28:18.172
Yeah, this thing was at full power
but now it won't turn back on.

28:18.208 --> 28:21.509
Can't you just, you know, reach
in and pull the pictures out?

28:21.544 --> 28:24.178
It's digital. I'm gonna have
to take it home and charge it.

28:24.214 --> 28:26.147
- And then you'll bring me copies?
- Yeah, or email them.

28:26.182 --> 28:28.451
Oh, honestly, you kids
and your technology.

28:28.476 --> 28:30.695
Do you have the photos or not?

28:31.721 --> 28:34.522
I will try to get them to you.

28:34.557 --> 28:36.591
Thank you. That's what I wanted to hear.

28:36.626 --> 28:39.060
Oh dear. Look at that poor thing.

28:39.095 --> 28:43.097
- Do you think it's going to survive?
- It does look a bit off.

28:43.133 --> 28:46.234
But it has to be okay.

28:46.269 --> 28:49.604
It's going to be okay.

28:50.514 --> 28:53.508
I suppose we'll just
have to wait and see.

29:06.122 --> 29:09.891
- I bet she'd love those.
- Pardon me?

29:09.926 --> 29:13.494
Well, if a guy like you bought
flowers like this for a girl like me?

29:13.530 --> 29:15.897
I know how I'd react.

29:16.603 --> 29:20.969
Except, well, we're not
dating. At least not yet.

29:22.217 --> 29:25.039
I actually need something
for my aunt's funeral.

29:26.752 --> 29:28.409
Oh.

29:29.402 --> 29:31.212
I'll get them somewhere else.

29:34.751 --> 29:37.251
- Hey.
- What are you here for?

29:37.287 --> 29:41.456
- Flowers. For Cassie.
- Just making sure.

29:41.491 --> 29:44.825
Didn't you just get flowers for Cassie?

29:44.860 --> 29:46.366
Is there some kind
of rule about how often

29:46.391 --> 29:48.129
a guy can give a person flowers?

29:48.164 --> 29:50.932
Seems like overkill to me, but
whatever keeps me in business,

29:50.967 --> 29:54.905
- I guess.
- What did that thing ever do to you?

29:54.940 --> 29:59.073
- It's boring, that's what.
- Oh. So, what do you think she'd like?

29:59.109 --> 30:01.843
- Roses, perhaps?
- I was thinking roses.

30:01.878 --> 30:05.913
- I'm actually out of roses.
- I saw one outside in a bucket.

30:05.949 --> 30:08.850
Oh, I guess I still do have one left.

30:08.885 --> 30:13.287
- One rose can be romantic, right?
- If you say so.

30:23.833 --> 30:27.168
So, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

30:27.203 --> 30:30.705
Oh yes, I know. And I know
exactly what you're going to say.

30:30.740 --> 30:33.674
- How can you already know that?
- I mean, I have a feeling.

30:33.710 --> 30:35.239
You and your "feelings."

30:35.264 --> 30:37.979
Look, Nick, we are...
you mean a lot to me.

30:38.014 --> 30:40.713
- Okay.
- And we're really good friends.

30:40.738 --> 30:41.950
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

30:41.985 --> 30:43.733
Right. So let's say that something were

30:43.758 --> 30:45.520
to get in the middle of that friendship,

30:45.555 --> 30:48.623
- then...
- Oh. I'm starting to see

30:48.658 --> 30:52.160
- where this is going.
- Oh no. Oh no, shoot,

30:52.195 --> 30:54.395
Abigail told me I was
supposed to... Shoot!

30:54.431 --> 30:56.439
You think that me asking Courtney out

30:56.464 --> 30:57.978
is gonna get in the way of me and you

30:58.014 --> 30:59.455
being friends.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.404
You want to ask Courtney out?

31:03.440 --> 31:06.841
Yeah, and I wanted you to help
me with the right things to say.

31:07.368 --> 31:10.845
Oh. - But you don't
even think I should ask her.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.181
No, no, no, I didn't say that.

31:13.216 --> 31:16.851
- Then what are you saying?
- If you want to ask her,

31:16.886 --> 31:18.920
just go ahead and ask her.

31:18.955 --> 31:21.589
- But what should I say?
- I don't know.

31:22.385 --> 31:25.393
Just start off with "Hey" and then...

31:25.428 --> 31:28.196
fill in the blanks from there.

31:33.431 --> 31:35.336
Hey, do you want me to pick up
something for dinner tonight?

31:35.371 --> 31:37.772
- I can make something.
- Yeah, but you're working all day.

31:37.807 --> 31:40.575
And somehow there are people
who manage to do both.

31:40.610 --> 31:43.478
I just don't want you
to have to do so much because...

31:43.513 --> 31:45.330
Because you don't think I can handle it?

31:45.355 --> 31:46.781
I didn't say that.

31:46.816 --> 31:49.383
But you keep treating me
that way. You pick me up

31:49.419 --> 31:51.385
and take me places like
I'm in the third grade.

31:51.421 --> 31:54.646
You stand over me while I'm working
in the kitchen as if I can't do it.

31:54.682 --> 31:56.724
I know that you try
to protect me from my mom.

31:56.759 --> 31:58.783
You don't have to protect me, Brandon.

31:58.808 --> 32:01.073
You do enough protecting
as part of your job.

32:01.138 --> 32:03.226
So what do you want me to do?

32:03.251 --> 32:05.407
I want you to stop
treating me like a child.

32:05.443 --> 32:08.123
I want you to start letting
me make my own choices,

32:08.148 --> 32:10.380
even if that means I get hurt.

32:27.910 --> 32:30.365
Hey. How was lunch?

32:30.390 --> 32:32.259
- Fine.
- Yeah?

32:32.599 --> 32:35.082
- When did these come in?
- Oh, yesterday morning.

32:35.117 --> 32:38.352
- More Quadrivium candles.
- What does that word even mean?

32:38.387 --> 32:41.328
I think it's Latin for "crossroads."

32:42.690 --> 32:46.193
- Huh.
- Can you help me find something?

32:46.228 --> 32:50.530
- Of course.
- Ben's been working so hard lately,

32:50.566 --> 32:53.700
going from job to job, that
he says his whole body hurts.

32:53.736 --> 32:56.051
I just thought maybe
one of your herbal cream

32:56.076 --> 32:57.537
mixtures might take away the soreness.

32:57.573 --> 32:58.948
I'm sure we can find something.

32:58.973 --> 33:01.674
Which is why I always
come running to you.

33:06.382 --> 33:08.912
You know, I'm sure
any one of these is probably fine.

33:08.937 --> 33:10.717
I wanna find the right one.

33:10.753 --> 33:12.720
- Okay.
- Uh...

33:16.592 --> 33:20.193
- Well, what about this one?
- I think that might do it, yeah.

33:20.229 --> 33:21.703
Great. How much do I owe you?

33:21.728 --> 33:24.488
- Price is on the bottom.
- Oh.

33:26.402 --> 33:29.436
I was kinda hoping you'd say,
"It's a gift," like you always do,

33:29.471 --> 33:30.957
because I actually forgot
my wallet at work.

33:30.982 --> 33:32.906
Well, then it's a gift.

33:32.941 --> 33:36.943
- You are so nice!
- Mm-hmm.

33:43.920 --> 33:46.053
How bad is it?

33:46.085 --> 33:49.222
Well, it's not good, that's all I know.

33:49.258 --> 33:51.353
This was definitely done on purpose.

33:51.378 --> 33:53.493
It's a cut, not a break.

33:53.529 --> 33:56.596
- Will it affect the plant permanently?
- No, it shouldn't.

33:56.632 --> 33:58.097
A cutting from one stalk
doesn't generally

33:58.122 --> 33:59.733
affect the system down to the roots.

33:59.768 --> 34:03.170
Except as you said yourself,
the Middleton Merriwick is unique.

34:03.205 --> 34:05.639
I'll set up a room at the station.
Start gathering evidence.

34:05.674 --> 34:07.349
I want you to use the conference room so

34:07.374 --> 34:09.009
I can track your progress
minute by minute.

34:09.043 --> 34:11.945
- Yes, Ma'am.
- I hope you catch whoever did this.

34:11.980 --> 34:13.625
We'll do everything we can.

34:13.650 --> 34:17.117
It's nice to see others who care
about the well-being

34:17.152 --> 34:19.083
of a plant as much as I do.

34:19.120 --> 34:22.533
It's because of what that
plant means. To all of us.

34:22.568 --> 34:24.935
All my life I've heard
stories about the way

34:24.960 --> 34:27.627
this plant has inspired
the people of Middleton

34:27.663 --> 34:30.630
and the wonderful things that
happened whenever it bloomed.

34:30.666 --> 34:34.333
Which is why we need to get the
Merriwick back up to full power,

34:34.370 --> 34:37.838
or else... well,
I just can't even imagine

34:37.873 --> 34:42.109
what might happen to this town
if we ever had to live without it!

35:19.087 --> 35:23.322
Hey. So how did it go with...

35:23.899 --> 35:27.860
your friend that I hope
is still your friend?

35:27.895 --> 35:31.931
It went. But I think I should
talk to Mom about it.

35:31.966 --> 35:34.440
That's probably a good idea.

35:34.475 --> 35:37.503
Maybe she's got a clearer head
than I do right now.

35:40.742 --> 35:43.576
Who's this friend you wanted
to talk to me about?

35:44.074 --> 35:47.379
- Nick.
- Are you two not getting along?

35:47.415 --> 35:50.783
Oh no, we're getting along.
So much so that I thought

35:50.818 --> 35:52.956
he was going to ask me out.

35:53.072 --> 35:57.556
I was honestly ready for it.
Then he didn't ask me out.

35:57.592 --> 36:00.896
Instead, he wanted my advice
on how to ask Courtney out.

36:00.897 --> 36:04.565
- Hm. And you didn't see that coming.
- Not even a little bit.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.236
What would you have said
to him if he did ask?

36:09.239 --> 36:10.489
I would have said no.

36:10.514 --> 36:12.466
Then you should have
been honest with him

36:12.501 --> 36:14.375
and told him how you really feel.

36:15.138 --> 36:17.378
I guess I didn't realize
that was an option.

36:18.713 --> 36:20.769
Why don't you tell me
what you're feeling?

36:20.794 --> 36:22.307
About Nick?

36:25.744 --> 36:27.221
He's like a brother to me.

36:28.113 --> 36:30.943
He's the kind of guy that
stays in your life forever.

36:30.979 --> 36:34.194
Not just some guy who wants to go
out with me on a couple dates.

36:34.229 --> 36:36.186
And there are gonna
be a lot of other guys

36:36.211 --> 36:38.701
to ask you out on those.
I'm certain about that.

36:38.736 --> 36:42.677
I don't know, Mom. I just...
I'm just not certain

36:42.702 --> 36:46.771
- about anything today. It's kind of weird.
- Yeah.

36:46.806 --> 36:50.475
The whole town's been anxious,
waiting for that flower to bloom.

36:51.309 --> 36:54.512
- Do you think it ever will?
- I hope so.

36:55.773 --> 36:58.583
I can't wait to see it, if it does.

36:58.618 --> 37:00.085
Me, too.

37:00.820 --> 37:05.356
And then you'll have a wonderful,
magical year of your own.

37:18.238 --> 37:21.020
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:21.045 --> 37:22.340
I got you something.

37:22.375 --> 37:26.210
- What is it?
- Well, I called some guys on the force

37:26.246 --> 37:29.180
and I managed to get a current
phone number for your mom.

37:29.631 --> 37:32.383
- I thought she changed it?
- She did.

37:32.419 --> 37:34.886
And this is what it is right now.

37:38.556 --> 37:41.826
I never thought I'd be able
to get in touch with her again.

37:41.861 --> 37:45.063
Now you can. If you want to.

37:45.098 --> 37:46.580
It's up to you.

37:58.313 --> 37:59.877
<i>He wanted to give you flowers?</i>

37:59.913 --> 38:03.848
Mm-hmm. He looked so cute
standing there with them.

38:04.336 --> 38:06.417
I think he actually picked them himself.

38:06.453 --> 38:09.854
- Wow.
- And then he asked me

38:09.889 --> 38:11.346
if I wanted to go out.

38:12.425 --> 38:15.793
Really? What did he say?

38:15.829 --> 38:18.429
He started with "Hey,"

38:18.465 --> 38:21.277
then he just kind of mumbled
a bunch of stuff after that.

38:22.215 --> 38:25.132
Well, look, I think you guys
are gonna have a lot of fun together.

38:25.167 --> 38:29.083
- Except not. I told him no.
- What?

38:31.092 --> 38:32.110
Why?

38:32.145 --> 38:35.446
- Well, because...
- What?

38:35.482 --> 38:37.915
Because I thought you liked him,

38:37.951 --> 38:40.003
and I didn't want to get
in the way of all that.

38:40.038 --> 38:42.854
No, no. Nick and I are just friends.

38:42.889 --> 38:46.224
Really? Because you kind of
seem like a lot more than that.

38:47.131 --> 38:49.861
Because of how good of friends we are.

38:50.330 --> 38:53.898
So, it would be okay if...

38:53.933 --> 38:55.463
Oh my gosh,

38:56.143 --> 38:59.904
- you like him!
- Only if it's okay with you.

38:59.939 --> 39:03.908
- Yeah?... Yes.
- It is okay.

39:03.943 --> 39:06.444
So you'd better get back there

39:06.479 --> 39:09.580
and say yes before he throws
those flowers away.

39:09.616 --> 39:13.251
Right. Okay. I'll be next door.

39:13.286 --> 39:16.721
And now that I know that
you're not interested in Nick,

39:16.756 --> 39:18.891
is it okay if I give
your number to one of the guys

39:18.916 --> 39:20.958
from the photo-taking club you joined?

39:20.994 --> 39:23.928
Actually, two guys wanted to
know if they could ask you out.

39:23.963 --> 39:25.997
They hardly even know me.

39:26.032 --> 39:28.866
Look, I'm just saying
that you're popular

39:28.891 --> 39:31.469
with the picture-takers, so, you know,

39:31.504 --> 39:33.805
it's not a negative
that you joined their club.

39:34.254 --> 39:37.575
Because I want to see life
from a different perspective.

39:37.610 --> 39:39.634
Just like my mom said.

39:39.659 --> 39:42.113
Hey, maybe one of the guys can get
your camera to work.

39:43.022 --> 39:46.140
I think that might be dead forever.

39:49.060 --> 39:50.488
Now go!

39:50.523 --> 39:52.513
Okay. See ya.

40:16.203 --> 40:17.335
Guess who?

40:17.371 --> 40:22.040
- Sam? Sam.
- I never get to sneak up on you.

40:22.075 --> 40:26.011
- It's for you.
- Aw, beautiful. Thank you. Ow!

40:27.347 --> 40:29.347
Oh gosh.

40:29.383 --> 40:30.541
Abigail must not have
gotten all the thorns off.

40:30.566 --> 40:31.682
Let me get something for that.

40:31.717 --> 40:36.054
- No, no, that's okay.
- Let me take care of you. For once.

40:38.358 --> 40:40.225
Okay.

40:40.260 --> 40:44.329
Hey. I just got off the phone with Ben.

40:44.364 --> 40:46.143
That cream you gave me made
him break out in hives.

40:46.168 --> 40:48.233
That shouldn't have happened.

40:48.268 --> 40:49.946
I know, it's weird.

40:49.971 --> 40:52.337
Anyway, now I've got to go to the
drugstore

40:52.372 --> 40:54.322
and see if I can find
something to cure those.

40:58.758 --> 41:01.246
What is going on?

41:01.281 --> 41:03.110
I just cut myself, that's all.

41:03.111 --> 41:07.146
No. Not that. Everything.
I've felt off all day.

41:07.182 --> 41:11.417
Is something wrong?

41:11.453 --> 41:13.463
I don't know.

41:14.305 --> 41:20.533
