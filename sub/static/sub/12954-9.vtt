00:00.151 --> 00:01.213
<i>Previously on Alias...</i>

00:01.214 --> 00:04.211
Marshall counted 12 sources that make up Prophet Five.

00:04.212 --> 00:06.086
It's like the Alliance all over again.

00:06.087 --> 00:07.585
How are you feeling, Dr. Desantis?

00:07.586 --> 00:11.773
Girl's alive. She calls herself Renée Rienne. Works with the CIA.

00:12.275 --> 00:14.776
Then keeping an eye on her won't be a problem.

00:14.777 --> 00:17.649
A job well done, Mr. Sloane. I'm so glad you took our offer.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.338
I didn't have much of a choice, did I?

00:19.339 --> 00:20.839
There's always a choice.

00:21.587 --> 00:22.587
We got Dean.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.836
They insisted to kill Michael Vaughn.

00:26.337 --> 00:27.835
They have plans for you.

00:30.277 --> 00:31.273
What plans?

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

01:02.088 --> 01:03.088
I'm back.

01:03.777 --> 01:04.777
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:05.019 --> 01:06.211
What took you so long?

01:06.212 --> 01:07.962
Traffic light out on Venice.

01:13.903 --> 01:15.932
- Want to look at something for me?
- Sure.

01:15.964 --> 01:18.776
You see an eyelash? Something itches like hell.

01:18.777 --> 01:19.895
- No.
- You sure?

01:19.923 --> 01:21.207
Yeah. Maybe it's those contacts

01:21.208 --> 01:23.402
you wore on the Ireland mission irritated your eye.

01:23.403 --> 01:24.403
Yeah.

01:25.279 --> 01:26.279
What's this?

01:26.528 --> 01:28.024
What do you think about orecchiette?

01:28.025 --> 01:30.275
I don't think I've ever heard of it.

01:30.775 --> 01:32.901
Wait a minute. Don't tell me you cook?

01:32.902 --> 01:34.714
There is a lot of things about me you don't know.

01:34.715 --> 01:35.715
You clean, too?

01:35.716 --> 01:37.961
I've been known to. Why, you thinking about hiring me?

01:37.962 --> 01:40.774
Why would I hire you when I get you for free?

01:41.216 --> 01:42.341
You taking a bath?

01:43.526 --> 01:45.838
Maybe. Maybe we're gonna take a bath.

01:45.903 --> 01:46.903
Damn it.

01:47.526 --> 01:49.588
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:49.590 --> 01:50.590
Let me see.

01:50.966 --> 01:52.841
- It's nothing.
- Not nothing.

02:06.152 --> 02:07.713
There you go. All better.

02:07.714 --> 02:09.211
You're gonna make a great mom.

02:09.213 --> 02:10.213
Yeah, maybe.

02:23.591 --> 02:27.189
It's just my mom wasn't exactly the best role model, you know.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.963
Yeah, well, the good news is that you're nothing like your mother.

02:29.964 --> 02:31.776
You're not there yet, Sydney.

02:33.216 --> 02:34.341
Did you hear that?

02:34.527 --> 02:35.827
- What?
- Radio.

02:35.965 --> 02:37.715
You need to go further back.

02:38.339 --> 02:39.339
Follow Vaughn.

02:40.152 --> 02:41.714
It's just the radio, Syd.

02:42.341 --> 02:44.903
If you don't like it, we can turn it off.

02:45.279 --> 02:46.279
That's right.

02:50.341 --> 02:53.278
How about a nice bottle of wine with this bath?

02:54.339 --> 02:55.339
That'd be great.

03:17.028 --> 03:18.028
Who are you?

03:21.267 --> 03:22.267
Sit still.

03:23.716 --> 03:25.403
We're almost there, Sydney.

03:27.527 --> 03:29.277
We almost have what we need.

03:30.029 --> 03:32.679
We just need to go a little further.

03:35.153 --> 03:36.715
What are you doing to me?

03:38.592 --> 03:40.529
Nothing for you to worry about.

03:40.780 --> 03:42.905
I'm just trying to help you relax.

03:43.652 --> 03:46.614
Why? What do you want?

03:46.840 --> 03:49.627
I just need to find a vein...

03:49.655 --> 03:52.892
<i>Stop. Are you certain this won't harm the baby?</i>

03:53.153 --> 03:55.153
Quite certain.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.627
Wait. The baby? Don't...

03:58.028 --> 04:02.528
But if you want your answer, you're gonna need to let me do my job.

04:02.903 --> 04:05.029
Who is that behind there? Who's behind there?

04:05.030 --> 04:06.805
<i>Okay. You may proceed.</i>

04:10.214 --> 04:11.464
If you hurt my baby,

04:13.090 --> 04:15.090
I swear to you

04:16.714 --> 04:17.714
I will kill you.

04:34.799 --> 04:38.036
- You like?
- Yes. I like very much.

04:38.851 --> 04:41.597
It's nice to see a girl like you eating noodle.

04:41.598 --> 04:45.798
My granddaughter... she tell me "too many carbs".

04:50.910 --> 04:53.247
Thank you. I'm late for a date.

04:53.724 --> 04:54.724
Okay.

05:08.835 --> 05:10.160
Excuse me! Mister!

05:10.660 --> 05:11.910
- Yeah?
- Thank God.

05:12.225 --> 05:15.411
I'm supposed to meet some friends in the Mission District.

05:15.412 --> 05:18.324
But my cab driver from Oakland just drove me off here and zoomed off.

05:18.325 --> 05:20.925
I've been trying to find a cab, but no one here speaks English.

05:20.926 --> 05:22.850
There's a stand two blocks over to the right.

05:22.851 --> 05:23.851
Thank you.

05:23.974 --> 05:25.974
Oh, do you know what time it is?

05:27.287 --> 05:29.037
Yeah, it's a quarter to...

05:30.036 --> 05:31.036
Nice watch.

06:27.724 --> 06:28.724
Again, Turner?

06:29.287 --> 06:31.099
You're gonna miss your plane.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.725
If you miss that pickup in Cartagena,

06:34.726 --> 06:36.788
I'm gonna hear from the Director.

06:42.851 --> 06:44.601
What'd you forget this time?

07:45.165 --> 07:46.827
Mister, you okay?

07:48.165 --> 07:51.352
This is agent 4962 Bravo requesting the technician.

07:51.483 --> 07:52.540
This is he.

07:52.541 --> 07:54.728
Dr. Desantis, this is Kelly Peyton.

07:54.853 --> 07:57.789
<i>Were you able to retrieve agent Vaughn's files?</i>

07:57.790 --> 08:00.040
Yes. I'm exiting Cha-kow street now.

08:01.851 --> 08:04.103
I'll run the analysis and be in touch.

08:04.104 --> 08:06.666
Excellent. I'll let our benefactors know.

08:07.416 --> 08:08.673
What's all that noise?

08:08.674 --> 08:12.036
You know how it is... rough neighborhood.

08:43.741 --> 08:46.050
After your initial triage and check-in,

08:46.051 --> 08:48.489
we'll bring you up here to the labor and delivery rooms.

08:48.490 --> 08:50.450
So this is where I'll be getting my epidural?

08:50.451 --> 08:52.590
Yes, it is, if you want one.

08:52.678 --> 08:54.613
I do. I'm not a big fan of pain.

08:54.614 --> 08:55.644
Are there any adjustments

08:55.645 --> 08:57.415
Sydney should be making to her lifestyle?

08:57.416 --> 09:00.804
I'm sure her boss at the bank would be happy to lighten her workload.

09:00.805 --> 09:01.805
No, she's fine.

09:02.927 --> 09:06.864
I tell mothers staying active for as long as they can is a good thing.

09:06.865 --> 09:09.033
You must be excited. Won't be much longer now.

09:09.034 --> 09:10.985
Oh, no, the due date's still three weeks away.

09:10.986 --> 09:13.804
Sure it is, but you never know. Your baby may be in a hurry.

09:13.805 --> 09:16.240
And you're far enough along, if your water broke today,

09:16.241 --> 09:18.428
we could expect a healthy delivery.

09:18.806 --> 09:20.306
I didn't know that.

09:20.490 --> 09:24.426
My service. I need to run. I'll see you next week for your checkup.

09:24.427 --> 09:25.427
Okay.

09:27.804 --> 09:29.404
So... any day.

09:29.805 --> 09:31.992
Well, she said it could be any day.

09:41.617 --> 09:43.492
I have something for you.

09:43.493 --> 09:44.493
What?

09:44.929 --> 09:45.929
A gift?

09:46.367 --> 09:50.054
Technically, no. It's already yours. I'm just returning it.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.053
Your mother and I bought it when you were born.

10:00.054 --> 10:03.866
You wouldn't let it out of your sight till you were almost 3.

10:06.992 --> 10:09.992
Reminds me of a time when I could keep you safe.

10:12.177 --> 10:14.114
It's beautiful, dad. Thank you.

10:20.366 --> 10:21.555
You wanted to see me?

10:21.556 --> 10:24.243
Oh, yeah. Hey. Agent Grace.

10:25.053 --> 10:28.180
Listen, I was doing some housekeeping... logging aliases,

10:28.181 --> 10:30.927
safe house authorizations, family contacts... you know,

10:30.928 --> 10:32.366
the sucky part of my job.

10:32.367 --> 10:36.709
And I came across a mistake in your file, so I contacted Langley.

10:36.710 --> 10:39.123
Turns out I don't have proper clearance to do my own job.

10:39.124 --> 10:40.180
What did you find?

10:40.181 --> 10:42.241
Marriage certificate from seven years ago.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.556
Listen, if it's to support an outdated alias,

10:44.557 --> 10:46.929
I'd probably have it rescinded sooner than later.

10:46.930 --> 10:47.989
You know, tax issues... 

10:47.990 --> 10:50.866
It's not a mistake. I was married.

10:50.867 --> 10:51.867
Really?

10:52.860 --> 10:55.056
I'm sorry. I never heard you mention that.

10:55.057 --> 10:56.029
For three years. 

10:56.472 --> 10:57.806
Didn't work out.

10:57.807 --> 11:00.743
Totally understand. I mean, it's a... it's a struggle.

11:00.778 --> 11:01.928
Hey, do me a favor.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.366
Next time you have a question about my personal life,

11:04.367 --> 11:06.303
why don't you call me before Langley?

11:06.304 --> 11:09.316
Absolutely. I'm... really sorry.

11:14.243 --> 11:15.243
I'll get Jack.

11:16.179 --> 11:20.303
Four hours ago, an agency facility storing closed matters was breached.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.765
Security cameras identified the perpetrator

11:22.766 --> 11:24.443
as an operative of Prophet 5.

11:24.444 --> 11:26.274
- Kelly Peyton.
- Do we know what she took?

11:26.275 --> 11:27.464
Among the archives were files

11:27.465 --> 11:29.474
of all our agents killed in the line of duty...

11:29.475 --> 11:31.382
their contact protocols, audio field journals,

11:31.383 --> 11:32.274
biometric readouts...

11:32.275 --> 11:34.366
They were Vaughn's files, weren't they?

11:35.409 --> 11:37.245
You were going to have to say it eventually.

11:37.246 --> 11:38.371
Yes, that's right.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.931
Why would they want Vaughn's files?

11:40.932 --> 11:42.137
It's unclear at the moment,

11:42.138 --> 11:44.055
which leaves us in a vulnerable position.

11:44.056 --> 11:46.554
Vaughn's investigation of Prophet 5 was off the books.

11:46.555 --> 11:49.245
It's unlikely he kept those records in a CIA file.

11:49.246 --> 11:50.384
I've tasked Tom and Marshall

11:50.385 --> 11:52.496
with disabling all of Vaughn's official protocols.

11:52.497 --> 11:55.620
I'd like you to locate any of his old contacts and issue a warning.

11:55.621 --> 11:59.055
Sloane will oversee Rachel in analyzing the remainder of the intel.

11:59.056 --> 12:00.056
Me?

12:00.931 --> 12:03.116
Though I would prefer to keep you close by,

12:03.117 --> 12:04.867
I know that's not an option.

12:05.306 --> 12:07.367
Given her intimate knowledge of Prophet 5

12:07.368 --> 12:08.993
and her association with Vaughn,

12:08.994 --> 12:10.431
you should meet with Renée Rienne,

12:10.432 --> 12:12.556
see if she has any idea what they may be looking for.

12:12.557 --> 12:13.557
Yeah, okay.

12:19.058 --> 12:20.058
Sydney?

12:22.619 --> 12:25.181
You should know, when it comes to Vaughn,

12:25.559 --> 12:27.246
I take it quite personally.

12:27.744 --> 12:28.744
I know, dad.

12:30.056 --> 12:31.556
We're going to fix this.

12:46.872 --> 12:47.872
Anything?

12:49.059 --> 12:50.206
Listen to this.

12:50.727 --> 12:51.743
The location?

12:51.744 --> 12:55.494
Not quite, but I think Vaughn shared it with Sydney Bristow.

12:55.744 --> 12:57.568
<i>...and I met this afternoon to discuss</i>

12:57.569 --> 12:59.680
<i>the protocol for her SD-6 countermissions.</i>

12:59.681 --> 13:02.493
<i>I briefed agent Bristow on the full scope of their operation,</i>

13:02.494 --> 13:03.681
<i>how far it reaches.</i>

13:05.121 --> 13:06.121
Go back.

13:09.745 --> 13:12.305
<i>I briefed agent Bristow on the full scope of their operation,</i>

13:12.306 --> 13:13.493
<i>how far it reaches.</i>

13:16.494 --> 13:17.869
She knows where it is.

13:19.119 --> 13:23.494
And you're certain agent Vaughn communicated this intelligence to her?

13:24.056 --> 13:27.218
Yes, according to his own CIA reports.

13:28.244 --> 13:29.535
But it was several years ago.

13:29.536 --> 13:31.495
There's no guarantee Sydney will remember.

13:31.496 --> 13:32.808
<i>That's of no concern.</i>

13:32.933 --> 13:36.433
An associate of mine will be able to refresh her memory.

13:36.496 --> 13:40.308
<i>I'll forward you the contact protocol for Dr. Gonzalo Burris.</i>

13:40.763 --> 13:44.288
<i>He's going to ask for a lot of money. Tell him you'll pay half.</i>

13:44.289 --> 13:47.041
Have him waiting for me at the Athena facility.

13:47.042 --> 13:49.914
Then you're suggesting that we abduct Sydney Bristow,

13:49.915 --> 13:52.542
<i>which, you realize, may compromise our larger agenda?</i>

13:52.543 --> 13:55.293
We've been searching for more than 30 years,

13:55.418 --> 13:57.543
and this is the closest we've come

13:58.102 --> 13:59.727
to retrieving the Horizon.

14:00.731 --> 14:03.356
<i>If Sydney bristow can tell us where it is,</i>

14:04.165 --> 14:05.665
we must act immediately.

14:06.103 --> 14:07.978
<i>It's a chance we have to take.</i>

14:31.915 --> 14:32.915
Hello, Renée.

14:33.979 --> 14:35.166
You look beautiful.

14:36.354 --> 14:38.666
Doctor said it's my last week to fly.

14:40.853 --> 14:43.103
Which means this is a special visit.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.918
Prophet Five is targeting some of Vaughn's CIA files.

14:49.106 --> 14:52.289
I need to know... did he make a record of your investigation?

14:52.290 --> 14:54.040
No. It was all in our heads.

14:54.630 --> 14:56.917
Well, then was there anything that Vaughn was working on

14:56.918 --> 15:00.729
or any leads or contacts that might be of value to Prophet Five now?

15:00.730 --> 15:01.915
What's in the files?

15:01.916 --> 15:05.543
Presumably, everything he worked on... SD-6, the Covenant, the Alliance...

15:05.544 --> 15:07.106
Then no. It's impossible.

15:08.793 --> 15:11.479
All the way back to SD-6, he was only investigating...

15:11.480 --> 15:12.667
Where did you park?

15:13.230 --> 15:15.105
- I walked. Why?
- Let's move.

15:16.201 --> 15:18.449
There's a police center on the corner. You'll be safe.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.826
Just take it easy. It might be nothing.

15:20.827 --> 15:21.827
Go!

15:33.762 --> 15:34.762
Sydney!

16:07.387 --> 16:08.387
You.

16:09.327 --> 16:10.952
Where are they taking her?

16:12.077 --> 16:13.764
Where are they taking her?!

16:18.078 --> 16:20.952
I've just sedated her with a propofol cocktail

16:20.953 --> 16:23.765
which should take full effect within minutes.

16:23.887 --> 16:27.199
It's a chemical process of forced hypnosis which will

16:27.575 --> 16:32.387
effectively numb the body but leave the mind partially lucid,

16:33.355 --> 16:37.555
allowing me to access any part of her memory you'd like.

16:37.917 --> 16:38.917
Which means

16:39.917 --> 16:43.729
it's now time that you tell me what it is you're looking for.

16:43.979 --> 16:47.541
<i>First, I'd like some proof that this technique will work.</i>

16:47.642 --> 16:48.642
Of course.

17:01.082 --> 17:02.207
Tell me your name.

17:17.396 --> 17:18.521
Tell me your name.

17:21.957 --> 17:22.957
Sydney Bristow.

17:25.329 --> 17:31.241
That's a girl. Sydney, I want you to remember Michael Vaughn.

17:36.767 --> 17:42.267
Find him. Find him and remember a time when you were both happy,

17:43.143 --> 17:44.830
a time that was meaningful.

17:51.082 --> 17:54.007
Go back, Sydney. Find him.

17:56.793 --> 17:57.793
Vaughn...

18:17.355 --> 18:18.917
I had it all planned out.

18:20.170 --> 18:21.170
Vaughn?

18:21.481 --> 18:23.418
No, just please let me do this.

18:24.328 --> 18:25.342
Do what?

18:25.343 --> 18:27.482
I was going to take you to the beach, Santa Barbara.

18:27.483 --> 18:29.480
We'd go for a walk, maybe during a sunset.

18:29.481 --> 18:30.606
But now we're here,

18:30.607 --> 18:33.480
and I have no idea what we're about to jump into,

18:33.481 --> 18:36.917
and I don't know if I'll ever get another chance to do this.

18:36.918 --> 18:38.980
But, Vaughn, we already did this.

18:41.544 --> 18:42.731
I don't understand.

18:44.545 --> 18:45.545
I think I do.

18:47.108 --> 18:48.854
The people you were looking for,

18:48.855 --> 18:50.917
the people behind Prophet Five...

18:51.257 --> 18:53.041
I think they're holding me.

18:53.042 --> 18:54.487
How do you know about Prophet Five?

18:54.488 --> 18:55.970
You told me, and then they shot you.

18:55.971 --> 18:57.855
What? They shot me? No, I'm here.

18:58.607 --> 18:59.607
I know.

19:02.004 --> 19:04.979
They injected me with something. They hypnotized me.

19:04.980 --> 19:06.981
They're trying to get something out of my head.

19:06.982 --> 19:07.643
What?

19:07.717 --> 19:09.641
I don't know.

19:10.543 --> 19:13.292
But I think they're trying to use you against me.

19:13.293 --> 19:15.155
Stay with Vaughn, Sydney.

19:16.794 --> 19:18.981
Remember the love you feel for him.

19:32.524 --> 19:33.792
- I should go.
- No.

19:33.793 --> 19:35.106
I don't want to be without you.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.994
I know. I miss you.

19:41.545 --> 19:42.545
Look.

19:45.234 --> 19:47.359
Sydney Bristow, will you marry me?

19:50.108 --> 19:52.417
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.

19:52.418 --> 19:54.105
You're supposed to say yes.

19:57.668 --> 19:58.668
Yes.

19:59.233 --> 20:00.483
I want to marry you.

20:01.859 --> 20:03.446
Okay, we've got it.

20:05.859 --> 20:09.234
Now perhaps you should tell me what we're looking for.

20:11.857 --> 20:13.699
There's a call for you on the overseas line.

20:13.700 --> 20:18.110
They're following our contact protocol, but I don't recognize the voice.

20:19.544 --> 20:20.607
<i>This is the Director.</i>

20:20.608 --> 20:22.608
Is this Sydney Bristow's father?

20:23.858 --> 20:25.231
Prophet Five has Sydney.

20:25.232 --> 20:27.307
She was last seen in a black van heading west

20:27.308 --> 20:28.796
away from the Salamanca quarter.

20:28.797 --> 20:31.646
Rachel, access Madrid's surveillance infrastructure.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.456
Marshall, monitor all movement through local ports and airspace.

20:34.457 --> 20:36.304
- What's the timeline?
- She was abducted 40 minutes ago.

20:36.305 --> 20:38.484
Well, they could've had her to the city limits in 20.

20:38.485 --> 20:39.795
- Then move!
- Right.

20:39.796 --> 20:41.946
We're assuming Sydney's capture is connected to something

20:41.947 --> 20:43.486
Prophet Five found in Vaughn's files.

20:43.487 --> 20:45.017
I'll reassess them with that in mind.

20:45.018 --> 20:46.818
Dr. Aldo Desantis was present at the ambush,

20:46.819 --> 20:49.671
which implies they may intend to use Sydney for a medical procedure.

20:49.672 --> 20:50.799
My God. The baby.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.331
Renée Rienne has Desantis in custody.

20:52.332 --> 20:54.556
I'm gonna join her and assist with the interrogation.

20:54.557 --> 20:55.931
Do you want me to come with you?

20:55.932 --> 20:57.921
No. I need you to run operations until I return.

20:57.922 --> 20:59.489
I'll secure a flight to Spain for you.

20:59.490 --> 21:00.594
Where do you need me?

21:01.795 --> 21:04.544
You're sure you have no means left by which to contact Prophet Five?

21:04.545 --> 21:06.896
Jack, I told you that Gordon Dean was my only resource.

21:06.897 --> 21:08.610
With him dead, I have nothing.

21:09.795 --> 21:12.232
Okay. Then use your underworld contacts.

21:12.233 --> 21:15.045
The news of a federal agent in captivity may have made the rounds.

21:15.046 --> 21:16.671
See if they know anything.

21:17.111 --> 21:18.423
I'll get right on it.

21:23.673 --> 21:26.296
This is Arvin Sloane. I'd like to speak to Mr. Ehrmann.

21:26.297 --> 21:28.106
<i>Mr. Ehrmann is not available.</i>

21:28.107 --> 21:31.169
This is an urgent matter. I need to speak to him.

21:31.296 --> 21:35.360
<i>You're not playing by the rules, Mr. Sloane. Remember, we contact you.</i>

21:35.361 --> 21:40.298
A pregnant woman's life is at stake... someone very dear to me.

21:40.612 --> 21:43.800
<i>The only woman you can save is lying in a hospital bed.</i>

21:43.801 --> 21:46.363
<i>May I suggest you pick your battles, sir?</i>

21:47.548 --> 21:48.229
Please.

21:48.429 --> 21:50.223
<i>Good-bye, Mr. Sloane.</i>

22:06.737 --> 22:07.737
Jack?

22:09.736 --> 22:11.048
Do you have anything?

22:11.738 --> 22:14.175
Satellites lost her at the city limits.

22:16.363 --> 22:18.925
If we don't get him to a hospital, he's gonna die.

22:18.926 --> 22:20.113
Has he given us anything?

22:20.114 --> 22:23.176
He won't talk, but I pulled this from his jacket.

22:23.736 --> 22:25.361
It's got dates, addresses.

22:34.365 --> 22:36.052
So this is how you do it...

22:37.174 --> 22:42.286
bring in a man in a suit... to scare me into talking?

22:43.362 --> 22:44.362
You're right.

22:44.614 --> 22:46.426
The suit shouldn't scare you.

22:47.989 --> 22:52.014
What should scare you is that I'm a very concerned father.

23:04.714 --> 23:05.714
No!

23:12.027 --> 23:14.964
I'm going to continue the regressive process...

23:15.780 --> 23:17.967
attaching her to a memory of Vaughn

23:18.214 --> 23:22.151
and then taking her back through time until we get your answer.

23:31.779 --> 23:36.816
Now, Sydney, I want you to remember the last time you were with Vaughn.

23:39.465 --> 23:42.652
Think of the comfort you feel when you're with him.

23:43.904 --> 23:44.904
Live there...

23:45.967 --> 23:47.029
in your memories.

24:10.465 --> 24:11.465
Vaughn?

24:15.904 --> 24:16.904
Vaughn?

24:21.248 --> 24:23.614
Sorry. I guess I drifted off there.

24:24.612 --> 24:27.967
Hey, we should think about more names for the baby.

24:29.156 --> 24:31.531
There will be plenty of time for that.

24:31.822 --> 24:34.654
I know. What do you think about Oscar?

24:36.468 --> 24:39.405
- What if we have a girl?
- I meant for a girl.

24:43.771 --> 24:45.583
I wish she were here already.

24:45.895 --> 24:48.417
- I want to meet her.
- You will.

24:50.519 --> 24:51.519
I know.

24:57.836 --> 24:59.086
Are you comfortable?

25:02.583 --> 25:03.583
No.

25:04.019 --> 25:06.708
When he feels ready, make sure he drinks it slow.

25:06.709 --> 25:09.084
Don't overdo it. Just a sip at a time.

25:11.019 --> 25:13.081
- I'll be back soon.
- Thank you.

25:17.085 --> 25:19.150
Can I... I'm thirsty.

25:31.149 --> 25:33.524
I gave you this, and then you crashed.

25:34.958 --> 25:37.250
- Vaughn... I can't.
- Sh, sh...

25:37.352 --> 25:40.798
They can hear us. Come closer.

25:43.166 --> 25:46.478
You said it yourself... they're using me against you.

25:47.351 --> 25:51.618
The only way to defeat them... I need to go away.

25:52.788 --> 25:53.788
I don't care.

25:55.051 --> 25:56.790
I don't want to say good-bye to you again.

25:56.976 --> 26:00.451
I know. I know. It's okay. I need to go away.

26:05.038 --> 26:06.413
We'll find each other.

26:07.101 --> 26:08.726
We always find each other.

26:13.728 --> 26:14.728
Syd?

26:14.884 --> 26:16.038
The baby kicked.

26:17.420 --> 26:19.352
Really? What's it feel like?

26:21.789 --> 26:22.789
Here.

26:26.601 --> 26:28.601
- I don't feel anything.
- Wait.

26:29.352 --> 26:30.352
There.

26:30.603 --> 26:34.300
- No, I... that?
- Yeah.

26:36.292 --> 26:40.555
Very good, Sydney. I want you to stay with Vaughn.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.974
- Don't ever leave me.
- Never.

26:49.006 --> 26:51.693
- Where are they taking us?
- Nowhere good.

27:04.694 --> 27:05.694
<i>Syd?</i>

27:09.322 --> 27:10.322
Vaughn?

27:11.007 --> 27:12.522
<i>Don't let him go. </i>

27:14.004 --> 27:18.085
I want you to stay with Vaughn, Sydney.

27:26.323 --> 27:27.823
<i>Sydney, can you hear me?</i>

27:28.383 --> 27:29.758
Vaughn, where are you?

27:30.195 --> 27:31.945
<i>I'm losing... go to chann...</i>

27:33.573 --> 27:35.564
Vaughn? Vaughn!

27:37.821 --> 27:39.821
<i>Don't let him leave you, Sydney.</i>

27:41.446 --> 27:43.097
<i>Where is Vaughn?</i>

28:01.135 --> 28:02.135
I'm back.

28:02.197 --> 28:03.572
What took you so long?

28:05.385 --> 28:06.760
They're back together.

28:10.198 --> 28:12.134
Tell me where they have my daughter.

28:12.135 --> 28:13.510
I'll tell you nothing.

28:14.007 --> 28:17.382
You've been shot. You'll never survive the blood loss.

28:17.636 --> 28:20.883
Though I am prepared to draw this out to the last second,

28:20.884 --> 28:23.196
make it as painful as it needs to be,

28:23.259 --> 28:25.894
until you tell me where she is.

28:27.134 --> 28:29.989
Where she is does not matter.

28:31.385 --> 28:34.940
Your concern should be where she is going.

28:36.322 --> 28:37.322
Jack?

28:40.074 --> 28:42.570
I found a repeating address in the calendar.

28:42.571 --> 28:43.946
"Kristina Korut 37/E."

28:43.947 --> 28:44.950
That's in Hungary.

28:44.951 --> 28:47.758
He had it marked three times in the last fourth months

28:47.759 --> 28:50.840
and once on this date, three weeks from now.

28:54.271 --> 28:55.448
Jack, what is it?

28:56.449 --> 28:58.011
That's Sydney's due date.

28:58.323 --> 28:59.385
Give me your gun.

29:05.980 --> 29:09.026
What's gonna happen at Kristina Korut 37/e?

29:10.042 --> 29:11.167
You'll never know.

29:12.106 --> 29:13.793
Is Sydney being held there?

29:14.044 --> 29:16.044
- Of course not.
- You're lying.

29:16.167 --> 29:19.167
Very well. Maybe I am lying.

29:19.980 --> 29:21.713
What's there?

29:22.104 --> 29:24.104
You can't do anything to me now.

29:25.043 --> 29:26.668
I'm quite prepared to die.

29:33.296 --> 29:34.606
See if he means it.

29:39.451 --> 29:43.323
Dixon, it's Jack. I need you to prepare a transport to Hungary.

29:47.587 --> 29:52.131
Sydney, think back to a comforting time...

29:54.233 --> 29:56.270
the place you were the first time

29:56.271 --> 29:59.233
you realized that Vaughn really cared for you.

30:07.919 --> 30:10.544
I forget how beautiful it is... the ocean.

30:11.605 --> 30:12.605
Yeah.

30:14.292 --> 30:16.542
We should have come here more often.

30:25.295 --> 30:28.017
<i>Draw me a map... how far it reaches.</i>

30:33.481 --> 30:36.543
- They're pushing me closer.
- What do they want?

30:38.168 --> 30:39.168
I don't know.

30:39.919 --> 30:42.136
- Something about a map.
- A map?

30:48.609 --> 30:52.637
<i>Listen to me. Draw me a map... how far it reaches.</i>

30:57.543 --> 31:00.793
You just threw your phone into the Pacific... twice.

31:03.669 --> 31:04.669
I know.

31:16.483 --> 31:17.483
Listen to me.

31:19.733 --> 31:21.358
You have got to let me go.

31:22.981 --> 31:23.695
I can't.

31:23.696 --> 31:24.857
You have to.

31:24.858 --> 31:27.674
I can't, Vaughn. I can't stand it...

31:28.981 --> 31:30.278
being here without you. 

31:30.278 --> 31:30.732
Sydney...

31:30.733 --> 31:32.670
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

31:33.984 --> 31:34.984
I do.

31:36.045 --> 31:38.170
Like I don't know who I am anymore

31:39.858 --> 31:41.796
or what I'm doing or why I'm doing it.

31:41.797 --> 31:44.045
Okay, stop. Do you remember the last time we were here?

31:44.046 --> 31:46.006
Your contact had just been killed in Morocco,

31:46.007 --> 31:47.687
and your world was collapsing around you.

31:47.688 --> 31:50.295
And I told you that even in the middle of all this darkness,

31:50.296 --> 31:52.671
you could not allow it to swallow you.

31:56.109 --> 31:57.421
You gave me strength.

31:58.482 --> 32:02.357
Yeah, but the truth is... the truth has always been you are the one

32:02.358 --> 32:05.233
that has kept the darkness from overtaking me.

32:07.669 --> 32:09.732
You can do this. I know you can do this.

32:09.733 --> 32:12.358
I've seen you do this time and time again.

32:15.357 --> 32:16.357
I'm gonna go...

32:19.047 --> 32:22.848
and you are gonna take these guys down. Okay?

32:43.485 --> 32:45.172
She's fighting the process.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.860
I want you to stay with Vaughn, Sydney.

32:58.234 --> 33:00.859
If you don't say good-bye to me, they win.

33:01.548 --> 33:03.048
I can't do it on my own.

33:04.797 --> 33:05.797
I'm not here.

33:06.298 --> 33:08.964
This isn't real. None of this is real.

33:09.172 --> 33:11.734
It's real to me. That's all that matters.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.982
Don't say that. That's what they want you to say.

33:15.066 --> 33:16.673
Do you know what I want?

33:17.170 --> 33:19.420
I want the world to forget about us.

33:19.422 --> 33:20.782
I'm tired, Vaughn.

33:21.296 --> 33:24.769
I'm tired of having this weight on my shoulders.

33:24.922 --> 33:27.610
I don't want to be the one who has to save the world.

33:27.611 --> 33:31.001
I want you back. I want you all to myself.

33:33.547 --> 33:37.836
I want to go away, just you and me and our baby, somewhere

33:38.984 --> 33:41.609
no one can bother us... a deserted island.

33:47.484 --> 33:52.204
I want out. I don't care if they win, Vaughn. I don't care.

33:54.359 --> 33:56.359
I just want you to stay with me.

33:57.487 --> 33:58.487
That's it.

34:01.050 --> 34:02.050
We got her.

34:02.310 --> 34:05.245
<i>Excellent. Now I want the map of SD-6.</i>

34:10.181 --> 34:12.047
I want no more of this spy crap.

34:12.047 --> 34:13.047
I just...

34:14.360 --> 34:17.109
that's why I went to you in the first place.

34:17.110 --> 34:18.422
So just listen to me,

34:18.980 --> 34:21.172
and I will give you, in record time,

34:21.237 --> 34:24.447
the names of people who will render SD-6 useless.

34:24.859 --> 34:25.859
Record time?

34:26.985 --> 34:30.329
Two months tops, and then I'm out. I walk.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.862
Draw me a map of SD-6 and all its allies,

34:35.170 --> 34:36.922
how far you think it reaches.

34:36.924 --> 34:40.094
Draw me an SD-6 family tree and how deep you think it goes.

34:41.735 --> 34:42.735
Just do it.

35:13.734 --> 35:16.046
This is what you're in the middle of.

35:19.235 --> 35:21.298
This isn't about cutting off an arm of the monster.

35:21.299 --> 35:23.424
This is about killing the monster.

35:26.173 --> 35:28.606
Focus on the map.

35:30.944 --> 35:34.372
The upper right corner... what do you see?

35:39.345 --> 35:42.445
There's a name. What is it?

35:45.936 --> 35:47.235
Tell me what it is.

35:59.486 --> 36:01.008
X-23 Norte.

36:02.737 --> 36:03.737
Well done.

36:05.926 --> 36:06.926
Well done.

36:13.174 --> 36:14.174
Good...

36:15.215 --> 36:16.612
<i>Thank you, doctor.</i>

36:23.737 --> 36:25.014
I'll let my associates know

36:25.015 --> 36:27.236
we've discovered the location of the Horizon.

36:27.237 --> 36:28.924
I'll be back in a few days.

36:28.987 --> 36:31.049
Until then, keep her comfortable.

37:02.423 --> 37:03.485
Do you hear that?

37:04.675 --> 37:06.112
I didn't hear anything.

37:08.113 --> 37:09.113
I know.

37:10.551 --> 37:11.863
It's great, isn't it?

37:20.925 --> 37:23.675
I wish we could stay here like this forever.

37:25.364 --> 37:27.114
There's nothing I want more.

37:31.980 --> 37:33.424
They're gonna figure it out, Syd.

37:33.425 --> 37:36.423
Sooner or later, they're gonna know you gave'em the wrong name.

37:36.424 --> 37:38.299
And when they do, I can't be here.

37:38.300 --> 37:40.425
They'll keep using me against you.

37:40.427 --> 37:44.177
They won't stop until they get what they want. I have to go.

37:46.606 --> 37:47.606
I know.

37:50.919 --> 37:53.981
We'll find each other. We always find each other.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.918
Unit three is on the third floor.

38:34.919 --> 38:36.856
The lease expired 16 years ago.

38:37.542 --> 38:38.542
Nevertheless.

40:08.060 --> 40:09.060
Good Lord.

40:10.305 --> 40:16.762
