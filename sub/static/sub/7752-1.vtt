00:01.845 --> 00:04.417
Did you know
I'm writing a book?

00:05.389 --> 00:08.440
It's about what I went through
to get my son out of jail.

00:08.559 --> 00:10.726
I had to work as a maid
for six months.

00:10.861 --> 00:13.695
- But you leave Friday?
- When we get settled in D.C.,

00:13.781 --> 00:16.148
Michael says we can finally
start talking about adoption.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.649
I'm Sebastien.

00:17.735 --> 00:19.701
So, obviously,
I want to see you again.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.119
I think we can arrange that.

00:21.238 --> 00:24.489
- I really like you.
- And I like you.

00:24.575 --> 00:26.792
- Morning.
- Oh, crap.

00:26.911 --> 00:29.044
Dad says you two are
getting back together.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.212
Your father's confused.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.713
So you'd rather be with Javier?

00:31.799 --> 00:33.582
<i>I just thought
you might want to know.</i>

00:33.717 --> 00:35.918
- <i>You're pregnant.</i>
- Been 15 years since he died.

00:36.053 --> 00:38.503
All these years I've blamed you
for Barrett's death.

00:38.589 --> 00:40.055
Can you ever forgive me?

00:40.140 --> 00:42.224
I think it's time
we forgive each other.

00:42.309 --> 00:45.928
All I see when I look at you
is a wonderful man.

00:46.063 --> 00:47.429
I let you
get away from me once,

00:47.564 --> 00:49.598
and I don't want that
to happen again.

00:49.733 --> 00:51.650
We think you're protecting
that boy you've been dating.

00:51.769 --> 00:53.151
[Voice breaking]
He's part of that gang

00:53.270 --> 00:54.770
that's been robbing houses
in Beverly Hills.

00:54.905 --> 00:56.822
You can go to prison
for not telling!

00:56.941 --> 00:59.608
I've decided to tell the police
about Ethan.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.527
We have to get rid of Valentina.
I'll track her down eventually.

Rosie!

02:25.362 --> 02:27.229
She looks like she's still out.

02:27.331 --> 02:29.131
You think we should pinch her?

02:29.233 --> 02:32.367
N-No... p-pinching.

02:32.503 --> 02:33.869
[Laughter]

02:34.004 --> 02:37.589
Oh, my God. Honey!
You gave us quite a scare.

02:37.708 --> 02:39.875
What's going on?

02:40.010 --> 02:43.095
You're alive, that's what!
Hallelujah!

02:43.213 --> 02:45.380
Spence and Miguel
are on their way.

02:45.516 --> 02:47.933
- How do you feel?
- Weird.

02:48.052 --> 02:51.553
I hope I can still go
on my honeymoon.

02:54.892 --> 02:58.393
What?
It's on Saturday.

02:58.529 --> 02:59.694

02:59.780 --> 03:03.698
Rosie, when you got shot,
you fell,

03:03.784 --> 03:07.569
and you hit your head
really hard.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.656
Honey, you've been in a coma.

03:11.742 --> 03:13.792
A-A coma?

03:13.911 --> 03:16.745
You've been out

He's parking the car.

Why are you looking at me
like that?

04:16.795 --> 04:20.130
They just told me about Pablo
getting killed in the shooting.

04:20.265 --> 04:21.298
You must be so sad.

04:21.433 --> 04:22.799
It was hard.

04:22.935 --> 04:26.219
I mean, we ended it so badly,

04:26.305 --> 04:28.722
and... then he was gone.

04:28.807 --> 04:31.558
Now I understand
why you got a little...

04:32.694 --> 04:33.643
What?

04:33.779 --> 04:35.479
Fat.

04:35.614 --> 04:37.147
You got a little fat.

04:37.282 --> 04:38.899
Which is really rude of you
to say, Rosie.

04:38.984 --> 04:39.950
I am not fat.

04:40.035 --> 04:41.485
It's... this shirt.

04:41.620 --> 04:45.372

And it's on <i> The New York Times</i>
Best Seller list.

04:52.331 --> 04:53.713
That's wonderful!

04:53.832 --> 04:55.665

04:55.801 --> 04:57.501
Yeah, well,
it's been kind of hectic

04:57.636 --> 05:00.136

Well, you make time
for Evelyn Powell.

05:02.724 --> 05:04.474
What?

05:04.560 --> 05:07.010
This one is best friends
with Evelyn Powell now.

05:07.145 --> 05:08.228
Here we go.

05:08.347 --> 05:10.096
She's not my best friend.

05:10.182 --> 05:11.932
She happened to have liked
my book.

05:12.017 --> 05:15.402

Got her holed up in a big house
that he rented for her.

05:22.027 --> 05:23.276
He's a real-estate agent.

05:23.362 --> 05:24.995
He can afford
to treat me well, okay?

05:25.080 --> 05:28.031
He is keeping you for sex.
It's completely demeaning.

you'd moved back to town.

We've been here for a while.

06:05.404 --> 06:06.703
We would've called sooner,

06:06.788 --> 06:08.622
but we've been a bit busy
with our little angel.

06:08.740 --> 06:14.044
Yes. Little Katy.
Wherever did you find her?

06:14.129 --> 06:16.246
Argentina.

06:17.299 --> 06:18.748
Michael had business there,

06:18.834 --> 06:20.800
and we went and visited
one of the local orphanages.

06:20.919 --> 06:22.552
I don't mean to sound rude,

06:22.638 --> 06:24.638
but don't we have perfectly good
orphans here in the States?

06:24.756 --> 06:27.090
Yes, but we took
one look at Katy,

06:27.225 --> 06:30.093
and we just knew
that she was our daughter.

06:30.228 --> 06:31.144
Right, sweetheart?

06:31.263 --> 06:34.147
Are they all mute?

06:34.266 --> 06:36.933
That is such a wonderful quality
in a child.

06:37.019 --> 06:40.937
Katy has emotional problems.

06:42.407 --> 06:43.773
Oh, dear.

06:45.327 --> 06:47.611
She had a bit of
a tough start in life,

06:47.746 --> 06:48.778
but she'll adjust.

06:49.414 --> 06:50.746
Of course she will.

06:50.832 --> 06:53.749
Katy, I keep a stash
of Belgian chocolates

06:53.835 --> 06:54.834
in my pantry.

06:54.953 --> 06:56.419
Would you like some?

06:58.339 --> 07:00.540
I think that's a yes.

07:00.625 --> 07:02.125
I will be right back.

07:09.017 --> 07:11.851
Honestly, Michael...
emotional problems?

07:11.970 --> 07:15.471
Argentina? Well, we can't tell
people the truth, can we?

07:19.144 --> 07:21.144
[Door opens]

Where were you?
I called you a bunch of times.

07:30.788 --> 07:32.038
I had my phone off.

07:32.157 --> 07:34.657
I was visiting my dad
at the cemetery.

07:34.792 --> 07:37.243
Oh. Well, I would have
gone with you.

07:37.328 --> 07:39.078
I wanted to be alone.

07:39.164 --> 07:40.163
What's up?

07:40.298 --> 07:42.632
Uh...

07:42.717 --> 07:46.836
- I bought you something.
- Aww. That's nice.

07:50.141 --> 07:51.090
What is it?

07:51.176 --> 07:52.391
Pepper spray.

07:52.510 --> 07:55.178
So you'll be able to protect
yourself.

07:55.313 --> 07:57.513
That's why I have you.

07:57.649 --> 07:59.482
No, I'm serious, Val.
What if I'm not around?

07:59.567 --> 08:01.267
Remi, they caught Ty.
He's in jail.

08:01.352 --> 08:03.069
No one's trying to kill me
anymore.

08:03.188 --> 08:05.605
You never know who's lurking
around the corner, all right?

08:05.690 --> 08:07.073
Please, just take it.

08:07.192 --> 08:10.860
Fine, but the next time
you want to buy me a gift,

08:10.945 --> 08:12.862
try flowers.

Hi! Hi!

08:23.575 --> 08:25.108
So sorry I'm late.

08:25.243 --> 08:26.692

at the hospital.

08:26.778 --> 08:30.363
We were just talking about
your interview on NPR!

08:30.448 --> 08:33.082
Terry Gross
raved about your book.

08:33.168 --> 08:35.034
I know.
It's so flattering.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.702
Of course
her favorite character

08:36.788 --> 08:40.089
was the ice-cold, ball-busting,
rich-bitch employer,

08:40.174 --> 08:41.374
Mrs. P.

08:41.458 --> 08:43.376
Yes, Evelyn is famous
at the club now.

08:43.461 --> 08:46.963
Did she really say all those
horrible things you wrote?

08:47.098 --> 08:50.183
- Every word.
- I'm positively terrible.

08:50.301 --> 08:51.634
Okay, now, I have
a very serious question.

08:53.104 --> 08:55.555
Who's coming with me to
the Barney's sale after lunch?

08:55.640 --> 08:57.106
Well, you don't need to twist
<i>my</i> arm.

08:57.192 --> 08:59.058
Marisol?

08:59.144 --> 09:00.726
I don't know.

09:00.812 --> 09:02.895

we should be filling our days

09:02.981 --> 09:05.648
with something more meaningful
than shopping?

09:07.118 --> 09:09.902
Where's all this coming from?

09:09.988 --> 09:13.239
My friend Carmen
says I'm becoming frivolous.

Yeah.

- Well...

09:23.801 --> 09:25.168

09:25.303 --> 09:27.503
You've had success,
and she's still a maid.

09:27.639 --> 09:30.339
It's... It's jealousy,
plain and simple.

09:30.475 --> 09:34.310
- Maybe.
- Ooh, and that reminds me.

09:34.395 --> 09:37.897
I need a final head count
for the book signing.

09:38.016 --> 09:40.900
Shall I invite
the maid friends or no?

09:41.019 --> 09:43.269
I don't know
if they'd feel comfortable.

09:43.354 --> 09:44.904
Can I get back to you?

09:45.023 --> 09:47.573
Fine. Just be sure to give me
some advance notice.

09:47.692 --> 09:50.076
I need to know whether
to lock up the valuables.

09:50.195 --> 09:52.662
What?
That is classic Mrs. P.

09:52.747 --> 09:55.448
- You're awful.
- It takes one to know one.

10:06.511 --> 10:09.629

some of my best work here,

10:09.714 --> 10:11.597
and you're very quiet.

10:11.716 --> 10:12.965
I'm sorry.

10:13.051 --> 10:15.685
I'm just thinking
about my friend Marisol.

10:15.770 --> 10:17.220
Interesting.
Is she hot?

10:17.355 --> 10:18.888
Stop!

She said some things today
that really bothered me.

10:22.026 --> 10:23.192
Like what?

10:23.278 --> 10:24.727
Well...

10:24.862 --> 10:27.480
she doesn't think I should
let you rent me this house.

10:27.565 --> 10:29.065
[Chuckles] Why not?

10:29.150 --> 10:32.702

keeping me here for sex.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.405
Sebastien!

10:36.541 --> 10:37.707
What?

10:37.792 --> 10:39.158
You know I cannot
spend the night.

10:39.244 --> 10:41.043
And you have that audition
in the morning.

10:41.129 --> 10:42.328
Right.

10:42.413 --> 10:44.880
So shouldn't we
move things along?

10:44.966 --> 10:47.500
Keep talking.
We can do both.

10:47.585 --> 10:49.552
How about tonight we just talk,

10:49.637 --> 10:51.971
like people who care
about each other.

10:52.090 --> 10:55.057
You think I don't care
about you?

10:55.143 --> 10:56.726
I've been trying to help
your career.

10:56.811 --> 10:58.311
If you'd only meet
with my wife...

10:58.429 --> 11:01.264
I can't.
I'm screwing her husband.

11:01.399 --> 11:03.266
That's low, even for me.

11:03.401 --> 11:06.269
- Okay, then, what about this house?
- What about it?

11:06.404 --> 11:10.106
You think I go around renting
houses for people I don't care about?

11:10.241 --> 11:13.070
It's a symbol
of my commitment to you.

11:14.646 --> 11:15.979
It is?

11:16.114 --> 11:20.366
Carmen, my life was nothing
before I met you.

11:20.485 --> 11:23.119
Well, when you put it that way.

11:26.658 --> 11:27.957
Okay.

11:28.043 --> 11:30.960
Is there anything else
you want to talk about?

11:33.048 --> 11:35.832
I think we're done talking.

11:35.967 --> 11:37.166
[Sighs]

11:40.472 --> 11:43.723
Margaritas?
You hate margaritas.

11:43.842 --> 11:46.392
I did,
but it's the strangest thing.

11:46.511 --> 11:50.146
Ever since I got Pablo's kidney,
I've been craving them.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.264
Join me?

11:51.349 --> 11:53.349
I'm trying to stay healthy.

11:53.485 --> 11:56.152
Oh.
Because you've gotten fat.

11:56.237 --> 11:59.772
You've... noticed that, too?

11:59.858 --> 12:02.692
Oh, come on.
Everyone's talking about it.

12:02.827 --> 12:04.660
Who's everyone?

12:04.746 --> 12:06.112
Well, mostly just me.

12:06.197 --> 12:08.364
But people always nod
when I bring it up.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.665
Oh, no.

12:09.751 --> 12:12.201
Oh, no, no, no, no.

12:12.337 --> 12:14.504
Oh, honey,
don't be so sensitive.

12:14.589 --> 12:16.005
You'll lose the weight.

12:16.091 --> 12:17.757
- No, I won't.
- Here.

12:17.876 --> 12:20.176
Alcohol makes
everything better.

12:20.261 --> 12:21.511
Not this.

12:21.596 --> 12:23.212
[Chuckling] Why not?

12:23.348 --> 12:25.381
Because I'm pregnant.

12:27.352 --> 12:30.053
Sorry, it's just so shocking.

12:30.188 --> 12:32.221
Aren't you a little old
to be pregnant?

12:32.357 --> 12:33.606
Not helping!

12:33.725 --> 12:38.728
And don't you dare tell
anyone else. No one knows.

12:38.863 --> 12:40.196
Not even Javier?
He's the father.

12:40.281 --> 12:41.447
Well...

12:41.566 --> 12:45.485
Wait. You mean, when
you and Pablo...?

12:45.570 --> 12:47.570
- It's possible.
- Zoila.

12:47.705 --> 12:50.573
I know! I should've done
a paternity test by now.

12:50.708 --> 12:53.793
But Javi's been away in Vegas
opening the new restaurant,

12:53.912 --> 12:54.794
and Pablo's...

12:54.913 --> 12:56.629
Gone.

12:56.748 --> 12:58.414
But Javi gets back this week.

12:58.550 --> 13:00.583
I just have to find a way
to test him

13:00.668 --> 13:02.303
before I start to show.

13:07.758 --> 13:10.309
Are you sure
you don't want this drink?

13:14.686 --> 13:17.103
Hi! Sorry!

13:17.222 --> 13:19.188
My publisher took me to Spago.

13:19.274 --> 13:23.442
The lobster salad was amazing.
I brought you some leftovers.

13:23.561 --> 13:25.645
Leftover fish
for leftover friends. Pass.

13:25.730 --> 13:26.979
Ooh.
Are these pot stickers?

13:27.065 --> 13:28.481
- Hey, you're Marisol, right?
- Yeah.

13:28.566 --> 13:29.866
I'm Blanca.
Nice to meet you.

13:29.951 --> 13:32.034
I've heard so much about you.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.986
Oh. Nothing bad, I hope.

13:36.074 --> 13:38.040
No. All good here.

13:38.126 --> 13:40.159
So, how do you guys
know each other?

13:40.245 --> 13:41.627
Mm. We met
a couple of months ago.

13:41.746 --> 13:43.212
She works down the street
from Genevieve.

13:43.298 --> 13:44.213
These are so good.

13:44.299 --> 13:45.214
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

13:45.300 --> 13:46.966
So you're a maid, also?

13:47.085 --> 13:49.418
- Actually, I just got fired.
- What happened?

13:49.554 --> 13:51.337
I just asked to change my hours
to go to college part time.

13:51.422 --> 13:53.589
The next thing I know,
I don't have a job.

13:53.725 --> 13:56.676
Can you believe that? They fired her
because she wants to go to college.

13:56.761 --> 13:58.895
Yeah. And now I can't afford
classes because I'm super broke.

13:58.980 --> 14:00.680
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

14:00.765 --> 14:03.733
Well, I know that the Stappords
just moved back into town.

14:03.818 --> 14:05.902
I bet you they're looking
for someone.

14:05.987 --> 14:08.187
Tell them about Blanca!
She's the best!

14:08.273 --> 14:09.906
She even cleans
under the toilet seat.

14:09.991 --> 14:11.607
I mean, who does that?

14:11.743 --> 14:13.859
- Everyone but you.
- Do you really think

14:13.945 --> 14:15.995
they'd be okay with me
going to school part time?

14:16.114 --> 14:19.031
Definitely. They're great.
I'll call Taylor tomorrow.

14:19.117 --> 14:20.866
So cheer up.
Have a pot sticker.

14:20.952 --> 14:25.087
Oh, those were for everybody?

14:26.958 --> 14:30.293
Thank you for squeezing us in
today, Doctor.

14:30.428 --> 14:31.594
It's been some time.

14:31.679 --> 14:32.962
How is your marriage?

14:33.097 --> 14:37.717
Good. Very good.
Well, mostly. It's just...

14:37.802 --> 14:42.888
In the bedroom, uh, lately...
things have been a little...

14:42.974 --> 14:43.889
Limp.

14:43.975 --> 14:45.891
I see.

14:45.977 --> 14:47.944
- In the penis area.
- I think he got it the first time.

14:48.029 --> 14:50.196
You know, there are
a number of medications.

14:50.315 --> 14:52.648
We've tried them.
Nothing seems to do the trick.

14:54.319 --> 14:55.651
I-I can't help but feel like

14:55.787 --> 14:57.870
Adrian just isn't attracted
to me anymore.

14:57.989 --> 14:59.956
How long
has this been going on?

15:00.041 --> 15:01.207
The last month or so.

15:01.326 --> 15:03.242
It's strange
because our marriage

15:03.328 --> 15:05.044
is better than ever, really.

15:05.163 --> 15:07.413
We recently got some
much-needed closure

15:07.498 --> 15:09.665
- on... on the death of our son.
- Ah.

15:09.801 --> 15:11.667
So no more
of the constant fighting.

15:11.803 --> 15:13.719
How does that make you feel,
Adrian?

15:13.838 --> 15:17.056
Well, nobody enjoys
fighting <i> all</i> the time.

15:17.175 --> 15:18.307
Some people do.

15:18.393 --> 15:21.093
They thrive on conflict.
It excites them.

15:21.179 --> 15:24.897
You're saying being happy
is making me unhappy?

15:25.016 --> 15:27.483
I'm not saying anything.
I'm posing a question.

15:27.568 --> 15:29.685
I'd like to pose a question...
When are we having sex again?

15:29.821 --> 15:31.687
Well, Rome wasn't built
in a day.

15:31.823 --> 15:34.407
You two are gonna have to work
on this together.

15:34.525 --> 15:36.575
And it's going to be
very, very hard.

15:36.694 --> 15:38.494
Can I get that in writing?

15:41.366 --> 15:45.201
You need 10 of Javi's hairs
to do the DNA test.

15:45.336 --> 15:47.336
And I have to pull them
from the root. I know.

15:47.422 --> 15:49.171
Sweetheart,
just how do you plan

15:49.257 --> 15:51.457
to yank out his hair
without him noticing?

15:51.542 --> 15:52.842
Easy.

15:52.927 --> 15:55.294
I'm gonna distract him
with my sex appeal.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.346
[Laughs]

15:57.432 --> 15:59.882
Oh, wait, you're serious.

15:59.967 --> 16:02.551
[Doorbell rings]

16:05.556 --> 16:06.806
[Door closes]

16:06.891 --> 16:09.308
I mean it.
You look amazing.

16:09.394 --> 16:10.309
I do?

16:10.395 --> 16:11.360
[Both chuckle]

16:11.446 --> 16:12.778
Don't get me wrong,

16:12.897 --> 16:14.613
I've always thought
you were beautiful,

16:14.732 --> 16:16.115
but today you're glowing.

16:16.234 --> 16:18.868
That's because I'm happy
to see you.

16:22.856 --> 16:25.708
- Oh, I've missed this.
- Oh, me too.

16:25.793 --> 16:28.377
I've missed this face,
these ears, this hair.

16:28.463 --> 16:29.578
[Chuckles]

16:29.714 --> 16:30.746
Ow. Ow.

16:30.882 --> 16:31.914
Ow!
I'm sorry.

16:32.050 --> 16:35.801
I'm just excited to see you.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.803
Javier!
What a delight.

16:37.922 --> 16:39.805
I had no idea
you were back in town.

16:39.924 --> 16:41.807
Hello, Genevieve.

16:41.926 --> 16:44.894
Come here and give me a hug!

16:44.979 --> 16:48.013
Oh, we've missed you so much.

16:48.099 --> 16:50.015
Just wasn't the same
without you.

16:50.101 --> 16:51.600
Oh. That's so nice.

16:51.736 --> 16:52.935
[Chuckles]

16:53.071 --> 16:55.271
Anyway, I'll just get
out of your hairs now.

16:55.406 --> 16:56.655
Hair.

16:56.774 --> 16:57.740
Ta-ta.

16:57.825 --> 16:59.108
Where were we?

16:59.243 --> 17:02.862
I believe we were doing this.

17:04.415 --> 17:08.000
Zoila, I need you!

17:08.118 --> 17:10.586
Hold that thought.

17:16.127 --> 17:19.462
We need more hair.
Are you kidding me?

17:19.597 --> 17:20.887
You need 10.
You only got 8.

17:20.888 --> 17:22.181
I can't keep pulling the
hair out of his head!

17:22.300 --> 17:23.465
He's gonna notice!

17:23.601 --> 17:25.384
Then you'll
just have to get creative.

17:25.470 --> 17:29.889
Now go.
[Sighs]

17:31.420 --> 17:34.610
<i>Hey, there, mister. Do you
know what else I've missed?</i>

17:34.695 --> 17:35.728
<i>This chest!</i>

17:35.813 --> 17:37.480
<i>Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

17:40.485 --> 17:41.984
And how is Tucker?

17:42.120 --> 17:44.120
Good.

17:44.205 --> 17:45.571
I think.

17:45.656 --> 17:49.625
Actually, uh, Peri
doesn't let me see him much.

17:49.710 --> 17:50.743
Oh.

17:50.828 --> 17:53.662
I'm sorry.
That's terrible.

17:53.798 --> 17:55.297
So it's just been
me and Miguel.

17:55.383 --> 17:56.999
I had to give up the house.

17:57.135 --> 17:59.135
We moved into an apartment.
It's not so big, but...

17:59.220 --> 18:00.586
That's okay.

18:00.671 --> 18:02.972
Wherever you are,
that's my home.

18:03.057 --> 18:06.342
I feel the same way.

18:06.477 --> 18:09.145
But what about the money?

18:09.230 --> 18:11.897
Hospitals are so expensive,
and you lost your job.

18:12.016 --> 18:14.016
Well, I got another one.
I did a movie.

18:14.152 --> 18:16.152
That's exciting!

18:16.237 --> 18:18.521
It was for cable,
so no big deal.

18:18.656 --> 18:20.773
Sorry.
Visiting hours are over.

18:20.858 --> 18:22.525
We'll talk about it later.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.827
I want to hear more
about the movie.

18:24.912 --> 18:25.995
You heard the man.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.746
Besides,
I got to pick up Miguel.

18:27.865 --> 18:31.333
I'm so proud of you.

18:31.419 --> 18:35.254
Did you hear that?
My husband is a movie star.

18:35.373 --> 18:36.589
[Chuckles]

18:36.707 --> 18:37.590
I know.

18:37.708 --> 18:39.091
You've seen his movie?

18:39.210 --> 18:42.545
Yes, I have.
And you are one lucky girl.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.013
What do you mean?

18:44.098 --> 18:47.266
I mean, the guy's like, what, 50?

18:47.385 --> 18:51.313
- And he's naked in every scene.
- Naked?

18:51.348 --> 18:53.772
Yeah. And from the
looks of that thing,

18:53.891 --> 18:56.058
I don't blame you
for taking a four-month nap.

18:56.194 --> 18:57.977
<i>- [Moaning] Oh!
- Oh, God!</i>

18:58.062 --> 18:59.562
<i>Oh, God!</i>

18:59.697 --> 19:02.448
Oh... God!

19:06.405 --> 19:09.703
[Cellphone rings]

19:10.385 --> 19:11.851
Hi, Carmen.

19:11.937 --> 19:13.219
Hey.
Listen, we're taking dinner

19:13.355 --> 19:14.637
to Rosie
in the hospital tonight.

19:14.723 --> 19:15.688
What do you want to bring?

19:15.774 --> 19:20.109
Tonight? Oh.
I've got this party.

19:20.228 --> 19:21.894
For my book.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.397
Well, thanks
for the invitation.

19:24.532 --> 19:26.866
Well, I wasn't sure
that you'd want to go.

19:26.952 --> 19:29.285
- It's at Evelyn Powell's.
- Of course it is.

19:29.404 --> 19:31.821
You know, I am tired
of your hostility, Carmen.

19:31.906 --> 19:34.407
Is it really so bad
that I've made new friends?

19:34.542 --> 19:35.908
Yes!
Because you care more

19:36.044 --> 19:38.161
about those fancy people
than you care about us.

19:38.246 --> 19:40.296
That is completely unfair!

19:40.415 --> 19:41.998
Ay, Marisol, it's fine.
<i>No me importa.</i>

19:42.083 --> 19:43.716
Go to your party.
It's where you belong.

19:43.802 --> 19:45.585
What is that supposed to mean?

19:45.720 --> 19:47.420
It means you were never
really a maid.

19:47.555 --> 19:49.055
You were never
really one of us.

19:49.140 --> 19:51.557
<i>- Do you honestly feel that way?</i>
- Yes.

19:51.643 --> 19:53.810
<i>¿Qué demonios es esto?</i>

19:53.928 --> 19:55.595
Carmen!

19:55.730 --> 19:57.597
I got to go.

19:57.732 --> 19:58.982
[Gasps]

19:59.100 --> 20:00.316
Who the hell are you?

20:00.435 --> 20:01.985
Herb Anderson?

20:02.103 --> 20:03.820
What are you doing in my house,
Herb Anderson?

20:03.938 --> 20:06.155
And if you like
top-of-the-line,

20:06.274 --> 20:07.940
wait till you see this kitchen.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.108
Carmen?

20:09.244 --> 20:12.111
I-I just found her here.
I swear.

20:13.281 --> 20:14.998
I thought you had an audition.

20:15.116 --> 20:16.115
They moved it.

20:16.251 --> 20:18.117
You two, go check out the yard.

20:18.253 --> 20:20.203
It's great for entertaining.

20:23.100 --> 20:23.956
This is one of your listings?

20:24.092 --> 20:26.626
I'm living
in someone else's house?

20:26.761 --> 20:29.128
Yes, but it's
a really nice house.

20:29.264 --> 20:32.515
You said this house
was proof of how much you care.

20:32.634 --> 20:34.183
I wanted to do something
for you,

20:34.302 --> 20:35.601
but I could not afford it.

20:35.687 --> 20:38.471
What do you mean?
You're rich.

20:38.606 --> 20:40.189
Actually, my wife is rich.

20:40.308 --> 20:43.526
I haven't sold a house all year.
I'm sort of broke.

20:43.645 --> 20:45.028
Oh, my God!

20:45.146 --> 20:47.980
I'm mooching off a mooch!

20:50.485 --> 20:51.651
[Sighs]

20:51.786 --> 20:53.569
I am so glad
that Marisol recommended you.

20:53.655 --> 20:55.738
You have no idea
how grateful I am

20:55.824 --> 20:57.657
to have some help around here.

20:57.792 --> 20:59.042
Oh, no. No, please.

20:59.160 --> 21:00.493
You've been so cool
about my schedule.

- I'm the grateful one.
- Aww.

Damn it, Taylor!
For God's sakes!

21:03.381 --> 21:04.414
Look what Katy's done now!

21:04.499 --> 21:05.715
Michael!

21:05.834 --> 21:07.967
Blanca's here.
She's our new maid.

21:08.053 --> 21:09.335
Hi, Mr. Stappord.

21:09.471 --> 21:10.803
Hi.

21:10.889 --> 21:13.222
I needed these papers
for my deposition in Boston.

21:13.341 --> 21:15.892
Katy's a child.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.

21:16.010 --> 21:19.762
That's easy for you to say.
She doesn't keep ruining your things.

21:19.848 --> 21:21.647
Why is she dressed like that?

21:22.901 --> 21:26.486
She's coming to Marisol's
book party with us.

21:26.571 --> 21:28.321
Have Blanca watch her.

21:28.406 --> 21:30.690
Yeah. I don't mind.
Really.

21:30.825 --> 21:32.825
We can't leave Katy
with someone new.

21:32.911 --> 21:33.860
You know that.

21:35.530 --> 21:37.029
Hey, Katy?

21:37.165 --> 21:39.499
Hey, Sweetie, how about
I make us a little snack?

21:39.584 --> 21:40.917
Yeah, do that.

21:41.035 --> 21:42.201
All right.

22:32.053 --> 22:33.469
Aah!

22:33.588 --> 22:36.556
- Aah! Val, it's me! It's me!
- Remi? Oh, my God!

22:36.641 --> 22:38.090
You pepper-sprayed me!

22:38.226 --> 22:39.642
I thought you were
gonna attack me.

22:39.761 --> 22:41.677
- Why were you following me?
- You were jogging alone.

22:41.763 --> 22:44.313
- I wanted to make sure you were safe!
- By scaring the crap out of me?

22:44.432 --> 22:47.316
Hey, I am your boyfriend, all
right? It is my job to protect you.

22:47.435 --> 22:49.101
Well, if you keep "protecting"
me like that,

22:49.187 --> 22:51.237
you're not gonna be my boyfriend
for much longer.

22:57.245 --> 22:58.911
Come on.

23:06.171 --> 23:08.671
You know, Katy,
sometimes parents fight,

23:08.790 --> 23:10.756
but it doesn't mean anything.

23:12.293 --> 23:17.513
See, the important thing
is that they love each other,

23:17.632 --> 23:19.432
and they love you.

23:19.517 --> 23:22.351
Like you love them.
Right?

23:22.470 --> 23:24.520
I don't love Daddy.

23:24.639 --> 23:27.139
And neither does Mommy.

23:33.615 --> 23:35.815
[Cellphone rings]

23:38.703 --> 23:40.069
It's Dr. Stevens.

23:42.156 --> 23:44.457
Hello?

23:44.542 --> 23:49.078
Does he have the results?
Is Javier the father?

23:49.163 --> 23:50.830
I see.

23:50.965 --> 23:52.999
Thank you, Doctor.

23:58.473 --> 24:00.256
Well?

24:03.595 --> 24:06.846
It's Pablo's baby.

24:10.852 --> 24:13.519
What am I gonna do?

24:22.990 --> 24:25.523
Good morning, beautiful.

24:26.071 --> 24:28.122
How was your night?

24:30.108 --> 24:31.574
I saw your movie.

24:31.660 --> 24:33.076
<i>[Moaning]</i>

24:33.161 --> 24:35.411
<i>- Oh, God! Oh! God!
- Oh!</i>

24:35.497 --> 24:37.614
- I can explain.
- What's to explain?

24:37.699 --> 24:42.869
Your wife is in a coma,
and you were making pornos?

24:42.954 --> 24:44.504
Soft-core!
Soft-core!

24:44.623 --> 24:46.539
I wasn't actually having sex.

24:46.625 --> 24:48.758
Is that supposed to make me
feel better?

24:48.844 --> 24:50.710
You think I wanted to make
that movie?

24:50.796 --> 24:52.462
It's the only job I could find!

24:52.597 --> 24:54.881
You call that a job?
Ernesto was a policeman.

24:54.966 --> 24:56.850
That was a job
I could be proud of.

24:56.968 --> 24:58.434
- Rosie.
- But this...

24:58.520 --> 24:59.886
This is humiliating.

24:59.971 --> 25:01.771
Rosie, you don't understand.
Miguel had no one.

25:01.857 --> 25:03.306
He needed me
to put food on the table.

25:03.441 --> 25:06.559
I'm sorry I didn't
make you proud like Ernesto.

25:06.645 --> 25:11.197
But I did the best that I could
for Miguel.

25:11.316 --> 25:13.616
He's my son now, too.

25:20.208 --> 25:22.709
I'm sorry.

25:22.828 --> 25:24.828
You were just trying
to be a good father.

25:24.963 --> 25:26.496
Yeah.

25:29.551 --> 25:32.001
So, you understand?

25:32.137 --> 25:35.004
I do.

25:36.354 --> 25:40.143
But if you make a sequel,
I'll put <i> you</i> in a coma.

25:45.183 --> 25:48.301
Oh, Zoila.

25:48.386 --> 25:50.303
I hate to see you cry.

25:50.388 --> 25:51.771
I just keep wondering

25:51.890 --> 25:54.273
how I'm gonna tell Javi
about this.

25:54.392 --> 25:55.558
[Sighs]

25:55.693 --> 25:58.277
Well, maybe you don't.

25:58.396 --> 26:00.480
[Sniffles] Huh?

26:00.565 --> 26:03.616
Your baby still needs a father.

26:03.735 --> 26:05.785
Why can't it be Javier?

26:05.904 --> 26:07.620
Genevieve.

26:07.739 --> 26:10.123
You'll break his heart
if you tell him the truth.

26:10.241 --> 26:11.290
I know.

26:11.409 --> 26:13.743
- He could leave you.
- I know!

26:13.828 --> 26:16.412
But I'm not gonna lie to him.

26:18.466 --> 26:20.633
That's very brave of you.

26:20.752 --> 26:23.753
But if I were pregnant
and alone,

26:23.888 --> 26:25.972
I'd be scared to death.

26:30.261 --> 26:32.145
How do I look?

26:32.263 --> 26:34.063
Better.

26:34.149 --> 26:35.515
[Scoffs]

26:35.600 --> 26:38.901
Again, I am so sorry.

26:38.987 --> 26:40.069
Mm. Don't be.

26:40.155 --> 26:42.772
I wanted you
to use the pepper spray.

26:42.907 --> 26:44.073
You wanted me to blind you?

26:44.159 --> 26:46.526
Not me, but a bad guy.

26:46.611 --> 26:52.498
Remi, ever since the shooting,
you've been hovering over me.

26:52.617 --> 26:55.785
Texting me, calling me.

26:55.920 --> 26:57.670
You have to stop.

26:57.789 --> 26:59.288
I can't.

26:59.424 --> 27:00.790
Why not?

27:05.346 --> 27:06.762
I ducked.

27:06.848 --> 27:08.297
What?

27:08.433 --> 27:09.715
At the church,

27:09.801 --> 27:12.351
when the shooting started,
I didn't protect you.

27:12.470 --> 27:13.769
I...

27:13.855 --> 27:16.389
[Scoffs] I ducked.

27:16.474 --> 27:18.774
There was gunfire.
Everyone ducked.

27:18.860 --> 27:21.310
- But if you had been hit...
- I wasn't.

27:21.446 --> 27:25.198
[Sighs]

27:25.316 --> 27:29.485
Valentina, you're my whole life,
my future.

27:29.621 --> 27:31.654
I don't want to live in a world
without you.

27:31.789 --> 27:33.823
I feel the same.

27:33.958 --> 27:36.993
Even though
I was such a coward?

27:37.128 --> 27:38.377
[Sighs]

27:38.496 --> 27:42.548
That day was the worst day
of my life.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.250
I lost my dad.

27:44.335 --> 27:48.221
I couldn't imagine
losing you, too.

27:48.339 --> 27:50.590
I'm glad you ducked.

27:56.147 --> 27:57.396
[Chuckles]

27:57.515 --> 28:00.349
Your eyes look... terrible.

28:00.485 --> 28:01.851
[Laughs]

28:01.986 --> 28:03.069
Oops.

28:05.010 --> 28:08.441
Oh, I'm sorry, Valentina.
Let me just grab my glasses.

28:08.526 --> 28:10.776
Valentina is of today,
Mr. Powell.

28:10.862 --> 28:12.995

- Colette.
- Have you been drinking?

28:15.583 --> 28:17.416
[Gasps] Of course not.

28:17.535 --> 28:20.870
I'm just new to this job,
and, well, I hope my boss

28:21.005 --> 28:23.623
isn't the type
to take advantage of me.

28:23.708 --> 28:26.125
I've never been more confused.

28:26.211 --> 28:27.877
Adrian, Dr. Haskell
suggested role play

28:28.012 --> 28:29.212
to spice up our sex life,

28:29.347 --> 28:33.015
and you've always had a thing for
maids, so I thought you'd enjoy it.

28:33.301 --> 28:35.301
All right, I'm in.

28:35.420 --> 28:37.253
Let's try this.

28:41.476 --> 28:44.677
I couldn't help but overhear
the other maids

28:44.762 --> 28:47.646
whispering
about your <i> large</i> reputation.

28:47.765 --> 28:50.099
Is that Valentina's uniform?
Is that a problem?

28:50.234 --> 28:53.652
It's just... I've come to think
of Valentina like a daughter.

28:53.771 --> 28:58.157
Well, perhaps you should take
the uniform off of Colette.

28:58.276 --> 29:00.993
Hate to be a stickler...
Does it have to be Colette?

29:01.112 --> 29:02.020
What's wrong with Colette?

29:02.073 --> 29:04.497
My father's second wife was
Colette... ghastly woman.

How about...

29:06.942 --> 29:08.617

And try it
with a German accent.

Okay, I get it.
You're mad at me.

Don't sleep with a married man.
Don't depend on a man.

sexier than yours.

- Well, it is now.

And, lastly,

30:24.278 --> 30:27.997
don't fall in love with a man

You know I would be with you,
but there's a prenup.

I get nothing.

Am I nothing?

You're everything, okay?

33:44.350 --> 33:45.633
And you get to miss

33:45.768 --> 33:47.635
all the difficult parts
of child rearing.

33:47.770 --> 33:50.771
I can assure you, we're not
missing <i>all</i> the difficult parts.

33:50.857 --> 33:53.641
No one ever said that being
a parent was easy, Michael.

33:53.726 --> 33:55.643
Excuse me.

34:00.283 --> 34:01.315
[Chuckles]

34:01.451 --> 34:03.201
I know
it's none of my business,

34:03.319 --> 34:05.369
but it's natural
for a new child

34:05.488 --> 34:07.738
to bring some tension
to a marriage.

34:07.824 --> 34:09.373
You're right.

34:09.492 --> 34:12.460
It's none of your business.

34:36.485 --> 34:38.186
Good, you're here.

34:40.273 --> 34:42.156
I think tonight's the night.

_

34:51.668 --> 34:54.418
Sorry, Gail.

34:54.536 --> 34:56.871
- Should I personalize it?
- Oh, yes. To my maid Elida.

34:57.005 --> 34:58.539
Oh, that's nice. I want her
to read about the woman

34:58.675 --> 35:00.791
who cleaned the foyer
with a toothbrush,

35:00.877 --> 35:03.211
'cause I'm hoping
she's gonna take the hint.

35:03.346 --> 35:06.514
[Laughter]
Yours can read English?

35:06.599 --> 35:08.766
I'll give you $5,000 for her
sight unseen.

35:08.885 --> 35:10.051
[Laughs]

35:10.186 --> 35:11.435
- That's kind of offensive.
- Oh, come on.

35:11.554 --> 35:13.271
You know how hard it is
to find good help.

35:13.389 --> 35:14.939
That's what your whole book
is about.

35:15.519 --> 35:16.851
That's not what it's about.

35:16.987 --> 35:19.854
I'd give anything for a maid
that didn't steal from me.

35:19.990 --> 35:22.357
Hell, I'd settle for one
that just isn't stupid.

35:22.492 --> 35:25.076
Well, if they weren't stupid,
they wouldn't be maids.

35:25.195 --> 35:27.328
Okay, that's it.

35:27.414 --> 35:31.533
These women that you take
such pleasure in deriding,

35:31.668 --> 35:33.618
they work their asses off.

35:33.704 --> 35:36.504
They literally get on
their hands and knees for you.

35:36.590 --> 35:39.124
And you think that makes you
better than them?

35:39.209 --> 35:40.875
Well, it doesn't.

35:41.011 --> 35:46.097
These women may not have money,
but they do have class,

35:46.216 --> 35:48.466
which is more than I can say
for you people.

35:50.103 --> 35:52.303
Marisol!
Where are you going?

35:52.389 --> 35:54.606
This has all been lovely,
Evelyn,

35:54.725 --> 35:56.975
but I think
I'm at the wrong party.

[Indistinct conversations]

36:06.507 --> 36:07.839
Carmen.

36:07.925 --> 36:11.376
Am I too late?
I'd love to see Rosie.

36:11.512 --> 36:14.546
What about your big party
and all your fancy people?

36:14.682 --> 36:17.349
They're not my people.

36:17.434 --> 36:18.684
You are.

36:18.769 --> 36:20.519
You mean that?

36:20.604 --> 36:25.607
Carmen, I am so, so sorry.
I did not mean to ignore you.

36:25.726 --> 36:28.060
I guess I just...
I got caught up in all of this.

36:28.195 --> 36:31.613
It's okay.
I guess I did, too.

36:31.732 --> 36:32.731
Oh?

36:33.711 --> 36:35.984
I broke up with Sebastien.

36:36.070 --> 36:37.819
You were right, Marisol.

36:37.905 --> 36:39.905
I became someone
I didn't respect.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.623
I'm so sorry.

36:41.742 --> 36:45.127
The only bad part is now
I don't have a place to live.

36:45.245 --> 36:46.628
Well, I have
an empty guest room.

36:46.747 --> 36:47.746
No, no.
I-I couldn't impose.

36:49.717 --> 36:51.917
Oh, hell.
I'm desperate.

36:52.052 --> 36:54.970
- I'm imposing!
- Good! Come over tonight.

36:55.089 --> 36:58.223
In fact, I have an idea
that I'd love to run by you.

36:58.309 --> 37:01.927
Idea for what?
The next chapter of my life.

37:02.062 --> 37:03.261

[Chuckles]

37:21.582 --> 37:25.784
So, tell me.
What got into you this evening?

37:25.919 --> 37:27.536
I trust you're not complaining.

37:27.621 --> 37:32.040
Oh, on the contrary. I'm
hoping for a repeat performance.

37:32.126 --> 37:34.459
You think it was the music?

37:34.595 --> 37:37.679
Perhaps a certain food
you were eating?

37:37.798 --> 37:41.133
Actually, I met the most
fascinating woman.

37:41.268 --> 37:44.825
Oh, my God. I had sex with
another woman's erection?

37:44.898 --> 37:46.145
But the orgasm was all yours.

37:46.146 --> 37:48.640
You were thinking about this
other woman the whole time?

37:48.776 --> 37:50.108
- Not the woman, the pain.
- What?

37:50.194 --> 37:51.777
She's a dominatrix.

37:51.862 --> 37:55.447
She stepped on my hand.
It was a revelation.

37:55.532 --> 37:58.066
I think I've heard enough.

37:58.152 --> 38:00.569
But I discovered the solution
to our problem.

38:00.654 --> 38:02.371
You just have to be
cruel to me.

38:02.489 --> 38:05.407
It shouldn't be that hard. You're
practically a dominatrix already.

38:05.492 --> 38:07.751
- You disgust me, Adrian!
- Yes, like that!

38:07.905 --> 38:09.521
I am going to bed now,

38:09.656 --> 38:12.524
and you can sleep
on the couch tonight.

38:12.659 --> 38:14.276

for the Velvet Whip.

about this, but...

in here tonight.

- What's wrong?

in the living room.

to clean it up.
