03:15.308 --> 03:16.798
Out from the night,

03:16.877 --> 03:18.469
from the mist, steps the figure.

03:18.545 --> 03:21.446
No one really knows his name for sure.

03:21.515 --> 03:24.814
He stands at 6'6" head and shoulders.

03:24.885 --> 03:27.820
Pray he never comes
knocking at your door.

03:27.888 --> 03:30.152
Say that you once bought a heart

03:30.223 --> 03:31.520
or new corneas,

03:31.591 --> 03:34.685
but somehow never managed
to square away your debts?

03:34.761 --> 03:37.730
He won't bother to write or to phone you.

03:37.797 --> 03:40.789
He'll just rip the still-beating heart
from your chest!

03:53.680 --> 03:54.977
Now, you could run.

03:55.048 --> 03:57.175
You could hide. You could try to.

03:57.250 --> 03:59.980
But he always has a way of finding you.

04:00.053 --> 04:03.113
He will come at your weakest hour,

04:03.189 --> 04:06.818
when no one is around
who might rescue you.

04:06.893 --> 04:17.769
<i>Repo man</i>

04:19.305 --> 04:22.673
And none of us are free
from this horror,

04:22.742 --> 04:26.041
for many years ago, we all fell in debt.

04:26.112 --> 04:28.842
New body parts were needed
to perfect our image,

04:28.915 --> 04:30.780
and until our debts are clear,

04:30.850 --> 04:32.613
we will live in fear of the...

and keep repossessions legal.

If companies like GeneCo
couldn't repossess organs...

Vote no on Prop 598.

06:12.752 --> 06:14.447
You disgust me.

06:40.847 --> 06:43.372
I'm sorry, Mr. Largo.

06:43.450 --> 06:46.419
I'm afraid... I'm afraid it's terminal.

06:57.564 --> 06:59.293
You don't have much time.

Maggots. Vermin.

07:52.619 --> 07:54.849
You want the world for nothing.

07:54.921 --> 07:56.821
Commence your groveling.

07:56.890 --> 07:58.915
Rotti, your king, is dying.

07:58.992 --> 08:02.792
Even Rotti Largo cannot
prevent this passing.

08:02.862 --> 08:04.762
Who will inherit GeneCo?

08:04.831 --> 08:06.594
I'll keep those vultures guessing.

08:22.615 --> 08:24.344
Guessing, guessing, guessing.

09:22.709 --> 09:24.904
This will be quick

09:26.713 --> 09:29.648
It's in my sight

09:31.651 --> 09:34.051
I'll capture it

09:35.755 --> 09:38.724
Then run back inside

09:38.791 --> 09:41.089
And be back home in time

<i>Enjou GeneCo's dau and nighttime

<i>Ask a gentern if Zudrate is right for uou.</i>

10:02.048 --> 10:06.815
And in this wake, a market erected

10:06.886 --> 10:11.414
<i>Buuing Zudrate

10:11.491 --> 10:12.753
An entire city

26:55.360 --> 26:56.850
for Marni's sudden death,

26:56.929 --> 26:58.191

27:25.457 --> 27:28.756
I would have given you the world.

27:28.827 --> 27:31.057
It's been difficult to see you

Well, it looks like I'll be joining you.

27:38.937 --> 27:41.030

<i>...for GeneCol</i>

37:59.557 --> 38:01.422
What's that?

38:01.492 --> 38:02.754
What's what?

38:02.827 --> 38:04.055
That.

38:04.128 --> 38:05.060
Oh. That.

38:05.129 --> 38:06.721
My window, it's cracked

38:06.798 --> 38:09.494
Then why aren't you
wearing your mask?

38:09.567 --> 38:10.966
Should I head back?

38:11.035 --> 38:12.024
No, I'm fine

38:12.103 --> 38:14.571
I can be there in no time

38:14.639 --> 38:15.936
<i>That won't be needed</i>

38:16.007 --> 38:17.031
But, Shilo...

38:17.108 --> 38:18.837
Your patients need you

38:18.910 --> 38:20.343
<i>Dad, who's that?</i>

38:21.479 --> 38:22.468
Oh, that?

38:22.547 --> 38:24.674
One of my patients. He's sick.

38:25.917 --> 38:28.215
- Will he live?
- It's looking grim

38:28.286 --> 38:30.345
You should stay there for a while

38:30.421 --> 38:32.685
I will rush home when I'm done

38:32.757 --> 38:34.748
Take your time, nothing's wrong

38:34.826 --> 38:36.088
I love you

38:36.160 --> 38:37.149
<i>- Daughter
- Father</i>

38:37.228 --> 38:40.554
<i>Medicate immediatelu.</i>

38:45.670 --> 38:49.036
<i>Blood pressure warning.</i>

39:00.551 --> 39:01.643
Zydrate

39:01.719 --> 39:03.414
Get your fill of it

39:03.488 --> 39:04.750
Zydrate

39:08.960 --> 39:10.450
You're real?

39:10.528 --> 39:11.961
Don't bother me.

39:12.030 --> 39:14.123
- I'm sorry.
- You'll get me caught.

39:14.198 --> 39:15.756
I must get home.

39:16.834 --> 39:17.858
Follow me.

39:19.337 --> 39:20.827
Where are we going?

39:23.241 --> 39:25.106
Where are you taking me?

39:26.110 --> 39:28.578
Mr. Largo, how are you?

39:28.646 --> 39:31.774
The folks at home would like to know
your thoughts and views

39:31.849 --> 39:33.248
about Zydrate use...

39:33.317 --> 39:35.547
And its abuses

39:35.620 --> 39:38.612
Would you care to comment, sir?

39:38.690 --> 39:39.850
Well, thank you, sir.

39:39.924 --> 39:43.325
Let me direct the matter
to my daughter

39:43.394 --> 39:47.558
The mind behind
the Zydrate support network

39:47.632 --> 39:50.601
Welcome Amber to the stage

39:52.003 --> 39:55.700
Welcome Amber to the stage

40:40.218 --> 40:41.242
How old are you?

40:41.319 --> 40:42.547
17.

40:42.620 --> 40:45.350
I had my first surgery
when I was 13.

40:45.423 --> 40:47.015
And thanks to Z,

40:47.091 --> 40:50.117
I couldn't feel
or remember a thing.

40:50.194 --> 40:53.823
A month later, I was turning tricks.

40:57.935 --> 41:01.496
<i>I'll keep a lock on it all</i>

41:03.174 --> 41:05.699
Drug market

41:05.777 --> 41:07.870
Submarket

41:09.380 --> 41:13.282
Sometimes I wonder
why I ever got in

41:13.351 --> 41:16.115
Blood market

41:16.187 --> 41:18.781
Love market

41:20.124 --> 41:24.424
Sometimes I wonder
why they need me at all

41:24.495 --> 41:26.759
Zydrate comes
in a little glass vial.

41:26.831 --> 41:28.162
A little glass vial?

41:28.232 --> 41:29.164
A little glass vial.

41:29.233 --> 41:30.564
And the little glass vial

41:30.635 --> 41:32.830
goes into the gun like a battery.

41:34.172 --> 41:35.537
And the Zydrate gun

41:35.606 --> 41:39.167
goes somewhere
against your anatomy.

41:39.243 --> 41:41.234
And when the gun goes off, it sparks,

41:41.312 --> 41:42.939
and you're ready for surgery.

41:43.014 --> 41:44.174
Surgery.

41:46.484 --> 41:52.046
Grave Robber

41:52.123 --> 41:56.560
Sometimes I wonder
why I even bother

41:56.627 --> 42:02.427
Grave Robber

42:02.500 --> 42:06.960
Sometimes I wonder
why I need you at all

42:07.038 --> 42:09.802
And Amber Sweet
is addicted to the knife.

42:09.874 --> 42:12.299
Addicted to the knife?

42:12.376 --> 42:13.468
And addicted to the knife,

42:13.544 --> 42:16.172
she needs a little help with the agony.

42:16.247 --> 42:17.578
Agony.

42:17.648 --> 42:20.173
And a little help comes
in a little glass vial

42:20.251 --> 42:22.219
in a gun pressed
against her anatomy.

42:22.286 --> 42:23.719
And when the gun goes off,

42:23.788 --> 42:26.916
Miss Sweet is ready
for surgery, surgery.

42:26.991 --> 42:31.586
Grave Robber

42:33.297 --> 42:37.256
Sometimes I wonder
why I need you at all

42:37.335 --> 42:40.827
It's clean, it's clear, it's pure.

42:40.905 --> 42:42.532
- It's what?
- It's rare.

42:42.607 --> 42:44.632
It takes you there.

42:44.709 --> 42:45.676
It what?

42:45.743 --> 42:47.734
It takes you there

42:47.812 --> 42:49.871
It's clean, it's clear...

42:49.947 --> 42:52.347
Before the cut

42:52.416 --> 42:54.350
It's clean, it's clear...

42:54.418 --> 42:57.216
I can do nothing at all

42:57.288 --> 42:58.915
It's surgery, it's surgery.

42:58.990 --> 43:00.548
It's surgery.

43:00.625 --> 43:05.392
It's the way your friends
may change inside.

43:05.463 --> 43:10.423
Feel alive

43:20.544 --> 43:22.569
Hey, that's Blind Mag's song.

43:22.647 --> 43:24.171
Who did that?

43:26.851 --> 43:29.251
So you think you got heart

43:29.320 --> 43:31.447
So you think you got balls

43:31.522 --> 43:33.854
So you think Mag can sing

43:33.925 --> 43:36.826
I don't think nothing at all

43:36.894 --> 43:39.192
So you think Mag has pipes.

43:39.263 --> 43:41.823
Well, it's my turn to shine.

43:41.899 --> 43:44.231
When the Repo Man strikes!

43:44.302 --> 43:47.328
What are you talking about?

43:49.106 --> 43:51.734
Mag's contract's got
some mighty fine print.

43:51.809 --> 43:52.798
Some mighty fine print?

43:52.877 --> 43:54.105
Some mighty fine...

43:54.178 --> 43:55.202
And that mighty fine print

43:55.279 --> 43:57.611
puts Mag in a mighty fine predicament.

43:58.783 --> 43:59.909
If Mag up and splits,

43:59.984 --> 44:01.383
her eyes are forfeit.

44:01.452 --> 44:03.852
And if GeneCo and Rotti so will it,

44:03.988 --> 44:05.922
then a repo man will come,

44:05.990 --> 44:07.617
and she'll pay for that surgery.

44:07.692 --> 44:09.091
Surgery.

44:10.461 --> 44:11.655
Surgery.

44:11.729 --> 44:14.357
I can't feel nothing at all

44:18.769 --> 44:21.465
Cleanin' up the city since 030

44:21.539 --> 44:24.474
<i>I can't feel nothing at all</i>

44:26.177 --> 44:28.668
Sir, we have Amber.

44:28.746 --> 44:30.680
<i>We're bringing her in.</i>

45:18.229 --> 45:21.096
<i>Incoming message.</i>

45:21.165 --> 45:24.532
<i>Nathan Wallace, come to mu office at once.</i>

45:36.447 --> 45:37.607
Honey?

45:38.682 --> 45:40.172
Are you awake?

46:21.559 --> 46:23.550
Well, who ordered pizza?

46:23.627 --> 46:26.221
I could sure go for a slice!

46:26.297 --> 46:29.562
Oh, never too pressed
for that dramatical entrance

46:29.633 --> 46:31.191
You wanted to see me?

46:31.268 --> 46:32.360
Thank you for coming

46:32.436 --> 46:33.767
Have your new assignment

46:33.838 --> 46:34.964
Hot off the meat truck!

46:35.039 --> 46:36.199
Is there a reason why

46:36.273 --> 46:37.740
You couldn't phone me this target?

46:37.808 --> 46:40.606
This is a job of special importance.

46:40.678 --> 46:43.476
It is involving a GeneCo employee,

46:43.547 --> 46:44.912
a singer we all know.

46:44.982 --> 46:46.472
That has-been soprano

46:46.550 --> 46:47.915
A traitor to GeneCo

46:47.985 --> 46:49.179
Tonight is her last show

46:49.253 --> 46:50.686
I can't afford a scandal here

46:50.754 --> 46:52.585
Please handle Mag as best you can.

46:52.656 --> 46:55.523
Take her down

46:55.593 --> 46:57.026
But Mag's eyes...

46:57.094 --> 46:59.085
Are GeneCo's.

46:59.163 --> 47:01.290
I know this may seem hard

47:01.365 --> 47:03.925
Mag was Marni's best friend

47:04.001 --> 47:07.402
You break my friggin' heart

47:07.471 --> 47:10.804
You can reunite them.

47:10.875 --> 47:13.708
I cannot do this job

47:16.013 --> 47:18.413
Remember who you are.

47:19.783 --> 47:23.412
Remember what you did to Marni.

47:31.428 --> 47:33.988
Must I take you back there

47:34.064 --> 47:35.361
Please don't take me back there

47:35.432 --> 47:37.024
Why relive that moment?

47:37.101 --> 47:38.295
I can't relive it

47:38.369 --> 47:39.563
That dark, fateful night

47:39.637 --> 47:41.571
When you murdered your wife

47:41.639 --> 47:44.631
It's too painful

47:44.708 --> 47:48.505
Marni was past helping

47:48.579 --> 47:50.240
Shilo's life was slipping

47:50.314 --> 47:51.838
Shilo was slipping

47:51.916 --> 47:54.646
She needed her dad,
and I needed skilled hands

47:54.718 --> 47:58.017
So I fixed things

47:58.088 --> 48:01.057
We made an agreement

48:01.125 --> 48:04.288
I will honor that agreement

48:04.361 --> 48:06.454
- You'll do as you're told
- I'll do as I'm told

48:06.530 --> 48:08.122
So Shilo never knows

48:08.199 --> 48:11.362
About that dark and fateful night.

48:11.435 --> 48:16.031
Or my secret repo life

48:16.106 --> 48:22.636
Don't deny your repo life

48:26.817 --> 48:29.752
Dear Marni, I am so sorry

48:29.820 --> 48:33.051
Can you forgive me for this?

48:33.958 --> 48:36.552
Not the death doctor
with the hungry scalpel

48:36.627 --> 48:39.653
Here's my prognosis, will they live?

48:39.730 --> 48:41.061
Doubtful.

48:41.131 --> 48:42.792
You're the street physician

48:42.866 --> 48:44.959
Carving rare sculptures

48:45.035 --> 48:46.662
Paint your ass like a Rembrandt

48:46.737 --> 48:48.466
Ha! You like that?

48:48.539 --> 48:51.838
Better start praying
when you see him coming

48:51.909 --> 48:53.206
For tonight, it's curtains

48:53.277 --> 48:57.111
You're the night surgeon

48:57.181 --> 49:00.014
I remember

49:00.084 --> 49:03.019
Remember what you did to Marni

49:03.087 --> 49:04.054
And who you are

49:04.121 --> 49:06.749
I remember

49:06.824 --> 49:09.019
Remember what you did

49:09.093 --> 49:10.390
To your knife!

49:10.461 --> 49:11.553
See it glide.

49:11.629 --> 49:13.859
See it slice!

49:13.931 --> 49:15.330
Who's your night surgeon?

49:15.399 --> 49:17.424
I hope you have my money

49:17.501 --> 49:19.025
<i>Or it's buon viaggi</i>

49:19.103 --> 49:21.264
He'll do your ass like dishes

49:21.338 --> 49:23.067
Amputation

49:23.140 --> 49:25.040
Remember who you are

49:25.109 --> 49:27.703
- Please, please, please!
- I remember

49:27.778 --> 49:30.144
Remember what you did to Marni

49:30.214 --> 49:31.806
Remember who you are

49:31.882 --> 49:34.316
I remember

49:34.385 --> 49:36.876
Remember what you did to her

49:36.954 --> 49:38.478
Remember who you are

49:38.555 --> 49:41.285
I remember

49:41.358 --> 49:43.849
Remember what you did to Marni

49:43.927 --> 49:45.792
Remember who you are

49:45.863 --> 49:47.854
I remember

49:47.931 --> 49:50.764
Remember what you did to her

49:50.834 --> 49:53.598
I remember every dying whisper

49:53.671 --> 49:55.104
Every desperate murmur

49:55.172 --> 49:58.869
I remember when I gazed upon her

49:58.942 --> 50:00.534
She looks just like you

50:00.611 --> 50:04.310
I remember

50:04.381 --> 50:07.475
I remember working every victim

50:07.551 --> 50:08.984
With acute precision

50:09.053 --> 50:12.614
I remember every time I hold you

50:12.690 --> 50:14.715
My blunt companion

50:14.792 --> 50:16.555
I remember

50:16.627 --> 50:18.561
I dismember

50:18.629 --> 50:21.427
'Cause the claims medic gives no anesthetic

50:21.498 --> 50:24.626
90-day delinquent
gets you repo treatment

50:24.702 --> 50:28.160
Remember horror
on your street corner

50:28.238 --> 50:29.762
Make your mama boil you

50:29.840 --> 50:33.071
I'm a night surgeon

50:36.680 --> 50:43.108
I remember

50:46.724 --> 50:47.850
Nathan!

50:48.926 --> 50:50.154
I cannot do this job.

50:50.227 --> 50:52.923
Find someone else.

50:53.964 --> 50:55.363
No one walks away from me.

50:59.336 --> 51:02.669
He wants out?
Then I will take him out.

51:38.041 --> 51:40.271
Shilo? Is your name Shilo?

51:40.344 --> 51:42.312
Can I talk to you?

51:42.379 --> 51:43.812
Can you come down, please?

51:43.881 --> 51:46.406
- Why?
- So we can speak.

51:46.483 --> 51:48.542
I saw you at the show

51:48.619 --> 51:51.588
I thought I'd seen a ghost

51:51.655 --> 51:53.714
Your resemblance is striking.

51:53.791 --> 51:55.850
You have your mother's eyes, her hair

51:55.926 --> 51:57.621
I was told you died with her

51:57.694 --> 51:59.924
All these years have come and gone

51:59.997 --> 52:01.191
How do I put this?

52:01.265 --> 52:02.892
I'm your godmom

52:02.966 --> 52:04.558
State your business.

52:04.635 --> 52:05.727
Business?

52:05.803 --> 52:06.735
What do you want?

52:06.804 --> 52:07.793
I want, I want

52:07.871 --> 52:08.997
To finally meet you

52:09.072 --> 52:10.835
Something real
to cling to, leave you

52:10.908 --> 52:12.637
With the hope that you will go to

52:12.709 --> 52:14.734
All you're meant to, all I failed to

52:14.812 --> 52:16.780
In you is a world of promise

52:16.847 --> 52:18.781
We have both been
kept in bondage

52:18.849 --> 52:20.874
But you could learn
from all my failures.

52:20.951 --> 52:22.714
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

52:22.786 --> 52:24.117
Or let them through the gate?

52:24.188 --> 52:25.416
That, either. A big risk.

52:25.489 --> 52:26.421
- A big fence.
- A big mistake.

52:26.490 --> 52:27.548
A new friend.

52:41.004 --> 52:43.495
Oh, my God. Mom?

52:43.574 --> 52:44.768
How'd you do that?

52:44.842 --> 52:46.867
- Do what?
- That. That eye thing.

52:46.944 --> 52:48.639
These eyes can do more than see.

52:48.712 --> 52:50.907
I know. I mean, I've seen you sing.

52:50.981 --> 52:52.812
- Where?
- From my window.

52:52.883 --> 52:54.441
I can see the world from there.

52:54.518 --> 52:56.986
Name the stars and constellations.

52:57.054 --> 52:59.079
Count the cars
and watch the seasons.

52:59.156 --> 53:00.851
I wish we could have watched together

53:00.924 --> 53:01.856
I can't have guests.

53:01.925 --> 53:02.914
- Never?
- Ever.

53:02.993 --> 53:04.585
If Dad found out
that I'd been let out

53:04.661 --> 53:06.026
or that you'd been let in...

53:06.096 --> 53:07.893
I should go, then, before I do

53:07.965 --> 53:10.126
- Promise me you won't
- Better that you don't.

53:10.200 --> 53:11.963
Don't forget a sheltered rose

53:12.035 --> 53:13.764
It's best if I resume my life

53:13.837 --> 53:16.135
Needs a little room to bloom
outside her bedroom

53:16.206 --> 53:18.231
<i>Chase the morning</i>

53:20.878 --> 53:22.641
<i>Yield for nothing</i>

53:24.014 --> 53:26.608
<i>Chase the morning</i>

53:28.051 --> 53:30.519
<i>Yield for nothing</i>

53:31.922 --> 53:36.950
Let your life be a dream

53:37.027 --> 53:40.986
Integrity, honesty

53:41.064 --> 53:45.398
It's too late for me

53:45.469 --> 53:46.993
Don't look back

53:47.070 --> 53:52.565
Till you're free
to chase the morning

53:52.643 --> 53:56.409
<i>Yield for nothing</i>

53:56.480 --> 53:59.074
<i>Chase the morning</i>

54:00.751 --> 54:02.912
<i>Yield for nothing</i>

54:08.992 --> 54:12.826
<i>Yield for nothing</i>

54:30.781 --> 54:32.078
Hi, Nathan.

54:33.083 --> 54:35.142
Mag.

54:35.218 --> 54:37.311
How did you get in here?

54:37.387 --> 54:38.649
Don't you have a show tonight?

54:38.722 --> 54:40.587
- How are you, Nathan?
- Busy.

54:40.657 --> 54:41.988
You never were

54:42.059 --> 54:44.721
A man of many words, Nate

54:44.795 --> 54:47.559
- You told me Shilo died
- Listen...

54:47.631 --> 54:50.532
Nathan, I promised your late wife

54:50.601 --> 54:53.502
I'd be present in Shilo's life

54:53.570 --> 54:56.061
Please, Mag

54:56.139 --> 54:57.902
Shilo's very ill

54:57.975 --> 54:59.567
It's not safe

54:59.643 --> 55:01.736
For her to see people

55:01.812 --> 55:03.905
I need to give her her medication.

55:05.215 --> 55:08.082
Dad, let her stay in here

55:08.151 --> 55:09.550
No, she's leaving

55:09.620 --> 55:11.212
Please hide her here

55:11.288 --> 55:12.949
- From what?
- She'll be dead

55:13.023 --> 55:14.650
Look, I told her she was sick

55:14.725 --> 55:16.192
Nathan, you are hurting me

55:16.259 --> 55:17.556
- Dad!
- My daughter needs a rest

55:17.628 --> 55:20.893
I'll be fine, Shilo, don't you fret

55:20.964 --> 55:24.331
Repossessions are dangerous

55:24.401 --> 55:26.096
You're not safe

55:26.169 --> 55:27.830
- Dad, she's not safe
- Shilo, don't you fret

55:27.904 --> 55:29.394
- Leave my daughter
- Your daughter's

55:29.473 --> 55:30.701
She is sick

55:30.774 --> 55:33.402
You've turned this house

55:33.477 --> 55:35.069
- Into a zoo
- I can't have this

55:35.145 --> 55:36.772
Marni wouldn't want this for you

55:36.847 --> 55:39.111
Set her free

55:39.182 --> 55:40.945
- Please don't leave
- Set her free

55:41.018 --> 55:42.144
Come back

55:42.219 --> 55:44.187
- Keep it down, Shi
- Come back!

55:44.254 --> 55:46.347
It's your bedtime, it's late

55:46.423 --> 55:47.856
- Dad, am I...
- Please

55:47.924 --> 55:49.414
- She will die
- Nonsense

55:49.493 --> 55:51.393
- It's arrived, Dad
- Nonsense

55:51.461 --> 55:53.554
- It's a contract
- A contract?

55:53.630 --> 55:55.097
- Come and see
- Nonsense

55:55.165 --> 55:56.723
Come see

55:56.800 --> 55:58.768
Mag's in trouble, Dad

55:58.835 --> 56:00.029
Where'd you get this?

56:00.103 --> 56:02.731
Read it, Dad, a repo man will come

56:02.806 --> 56:05.036
and take Mag's eyes!

56:05.108 --> 56:06.837
There are things in life

56:06.910 --> 56:08.810
That we do best to leave alone

56:08.879 --> 56:10.471
She'll die, you must help her, Dad

56:10.547 --> 56:12.572
- That are beyond control
- You must stop her

56:12.649 --> 56:13.638
That you don't want to know

56:13.717 --> 56:15.082
Will you save Mag?

56:15.152 --> 56:16.210
She will lose her eyes

56:16.286 --> 56:17.685
Unless you stop this repo man

56:17.754 --> 56:19.119
Shilo, this is senseless

56:19.189 --> 56:20.713
- Dad, you have to try.
- Shilo

56:20.791 --> 56:22.816
- This is pointless.
- You can't let her die!

56:22.893 --> 56:24.121
Please, shut up!

56:40.877 --> 56:46.110
Your mother's death
taught me to accept

56:46.183 --> 56:50.051
That nothing ever lasts in this world

56:50.120 --> 56:54.887
Foolish dreams
can destroy a grown man

56:57.260 --> 57:00.752
What chance has a 17-year-old girl?

57:01.998 --> 57:06.298
I don't know what I was thinking

57:06.369 --> 57:09.998
There's no sense in girlish dreaming

57:10.073 --> 57:15.773
I'm just 17, 17

57:16.179 --> 57:18.079
And it's better than 40.

57:24.354 --> 57:26.151
Mama drama's got to go

57:27.524 --> 57:29.321
Nothing's gonna bring her back

57:30.961 --> 57:33.191
Experiment with something living

57:35.165 --> 57:37.565
Because I'm sweeter than 16

57:39.102 --> 57:40.569
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

57:52.182 --> 57:53.774
I've always longed for true affection

57:55.352 --> 57:57.115
But you compared me to a corpse!

57:57.187 --> 57:58.984
Dead, with the dead

57:59.055 --> 58:02.616
- I'm joining the living
- 17

58:02.692 --> 58:06.458
Because I'm freer than 16

58:06.530 --> 58:08.794
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

58:18.642 --> 58:20.200
Shilo.

58:30.587 --> 58:32.817
Something's changing

58:34.257 --> 58:37.226
I can feel it

58:37.294 --> 58:39.728
17 now

58:40.964 --> 58:43.228
Why can't you see it?

58:44.334 --> 58:47.667
17 and you can't stop me

58:47.737 --> 58:51.571
17 and you won't boss me

58:52.776 --> 58:56.007
You cannot control me, Father

58:56.079 --> 59:01.016
Daddy's girl's a fucking monster

59:08.992 --> 59:10.425
I'm sorry.

59:10.493 --> 59:11.858
<i>Shilo.</i>

59:18.835 --> 59:20.860
<i>Listen, alll</i>

59:42.425 --> 59:45.019
I've never been
so surgically maimed

59:45.095 --> 59:46.790
Amber, please, it's not that bad.

59:46.863 --> 59:49.627
I'll be the laughingstock of the stage

59:49.699 --> 59:51.223
Daughter, please, it's not that bad

59:51.301 --> 59:53.235
This is your fault,
I asked you to help me

59:53.303 --> 59:55.168
No, Amber, please

59:55.238 --> 59:56.865
I warned you about this

59:56.940 --> 59:59.773
Happiness is not a warm scalpel

59:59.843 --> 01:00:02.471
I don't care! It's not fair!

01:00:06.449 --> 01:00:11.250
Baby, baby, baby,
don't do this

01:00:11.321 --> 01:00:15.553
I will never sing again

01:00:15.625 --> 01:00:20.824
I gave you the life I wished I'd had

01:00:20.897 --> 01:00:25.960
I look like a crime scene, Dad

01:00:26.036 --> 01:00:30.530
All you ever do is take, take, take

01:00:30.607 --> 01:00:34.703
All I ever do is give

01:00:34.778 --> 01:00:39.772
That surgery was only 90 grand

01:00:39.849 --> 01:00:41.612
I did not complain

01:00:41.685 --> 01:00:43.312
When you changed your name

01:00:43.386 --> 01:00:45.479
From Largo to Sweet

01:00:45.555 --> 01:00:47.386
I need a stage name!

01:00:47.457 --> 01:00:49.015
You are a disgrace

01:00:49.092 --> 01:00:52.255
Your genes are not worthy of mine

01:01:09.846 --> 01:01:11.711
Are you okay, Daddy?

01:01:14.851 --> 01:01:16.785
I'll have one of my surgeons fix you up

01:01:16.853 --> 01:01:18.753
so you can sing tonight.

01:01:18.822 --> 01:01:20.187
Thanks, Daddy.

01:01:29.132 --> 01:01:31.692
Flesh is weak.

01:01:31.768 --> 01:01:35.670
Blood is cheap.

01:01:35.739 --> 01:01:38.833
Inconsistent.

01:01:38.908 --> 01:01:42.366
Consistently

01:01:42.445 --> 01:01:45.881
Use your sense

01:01:45.949 --> 01:01:49.214
Save your cents

01:01:49.285 --> 01:01:56.521
The only thing with persistence is

01:01:56.593 --> 01:01:58.493
Gold

01:01:58.561 --> 01:02:03.055
It makes the world go round

01:02:03.133 --> 01:02:05.567
Gold

01:02:05.635 --> 01:02:10.698
It makes the world go round

01:02:13.343 --> 01:02:14.935
But before I go

01:02:15.011 --> 01:02:16.137
My kids will know

01:02:16.212 --> 01:02:18.908
About the man they have crossed

01:02:18.982 --> 01:02:21.314
As Marni did the day she fled

01:02:21.384 --> 01:02:23.443
And became Nathan's wife

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.216
She forced my hand,
he dug her grave

01:02:26.289 --> 01:02:28.553
I will not be betrayed

01:02:28.625 --> 01:02:31.287
Empty the trash of all of them

01:02:31.361 --> 01:02:37.891
And leave it all to the kid

01:02:40.236 --> 01:02:41.931
Lay the bait

01:02:43.106 --> 01:02:46.075
Shilo's fate

01:02:46.142 --> 01:02:48.702
But only if

01:02:48.778 --> 01:02:52.646
And will she appreciate

01:02:52.715 --> 01:02:56.116
That gold

01:02:56.186 --> 01:02:59.747
It makes the world go round

01:02:59.823 --> 01:03:02.656
Gold

01:03:02.725 --> 01:03:08.095
It makes the world go round

01:03:08.164 --> 01:03:15.536
Gold

01:03:18.341 --> 01:03:20.366
<i>Shilo, I have uour cure.</i>

01:03:20.443 --> 01:03:22.604
<i>Tonight all will be revealed.</i>

01:03:22.679 --> 01:03:24.806
<i>See uou at the opera.</i>

01:03:24.881 --> 01:03:28.715
So Rotti thinks he can take Shilo.

01:03:28.785 --> 01:03:30.013
Dad?

01:03:30.086 --> 01:03:32.111
Nothing, Shilo, nothing

01:03:32.188 --> 01:03:34.918
Go to bed

01:03:38.361 --> 01:03:40.659
Why didn't you tell me
I had a godmother?

01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:43.062
What?

01:03:43.133 --> 01:03:45.294
What are you talking about, precious?

01:04:22.572 --> 01:04:27.874
<i>Lovelu, Mag, sing</i>

01:04:45.695 --> 01:04:47.925
<i>Attention, all GeneCo personnel.</i>

01:04:47.997 --> 01:04:50.431
<i>Apprehend the Repo Man
Nathan Wallace at once.</i>

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.660
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

01:04:51.734 --> 01:04:54.464
<i>I want Nathan Wallace taken out.</i>

01:05:00.677 --> 01:05:01.974
Shilo?

01:05:02.045 --> 01:05:05.378
Come to the opera with me

01:05:08.051 --> 01:05:09.416
Shilo!

01:05:15.625 --> 01:05:19.356
Tonight we are betrayed

01:05:21.064 --> 01:05:23.999
Keep Shilo safe

01:05:25.268 --> 01:05:29.432
Make Rotti pay

01:05:30.773 --> 01:05:33.936
I'll man his grave

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:36.843
At the opera...

01:05:36.913 --> 01:05:40.144
tonight.

01:05:46.289 --> 01:05:48.348
<i>Shilo, this dress</i>

01:05:48.424 --> 01:05:49.721
<i>once belonged to uour mother.</i>

01:05:49.792 --> 01:05:51.054
<i>I would be most honored</i>

01:05:51.127 --> 01:05:53.357
<i>if uou wore it to the opera.</i>

01:05:53.429 --> 01:05:55.989
I must be brave

01:05:58.067 --> 01:06:00.160
Come, come what may

01:06:01.971 --> 01:06:03.700
Can I be saved?

01:06:06.042 --> 01:06:11.605
Is there a way at the opera tonight?

01:06:18.421 --> 01:06:20.753
I've made my peace

01:06:20.823 --> 01:06:22.757
No chance for peace

01:06:22.825 --> 01:06:24.759
I hold no grudge

01:06:24.827 --> 01:06:27.057
I'll end this grudge

01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:28.757
I'm gonna sing

01:06:28.831 --> 01:06:30.822
I'll stain the streets

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:32.765
- My final song
- They'll run with blood

01:06:32.835 --> 01:06:39.570
At the opera tonight

01:06:42.712 --> 01:06:44.805
One more hit for the show

01:06:44.881 --> 01:06:46.712
- Make it fast
- Take it slow.

01:06:46.783 --> 01:06:48.774
One more hit of the glow

01:06:48.851 --> 01:06:50.216
Go get cut.

01:06:50.286 --> 01:06:51.685
For tonight's show

01:06:51.754 --> 01:06:53.346
Tonight I set the stage

01:06:53.423 --> 01:06:54.856
Tonight we set the stage

01:06:54.924 --> 01:06:57.825
My greatest play

01:06:57.894 --> 01:06:58.952
My greatest face.

01:06:59.028 --> 01:07:00.757
I'll take the lead

01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:02.855
- My greatest rage!
- Pavi gets laid.

01:07:02.932 --> 01:07:05.400
All debts are paid

01:07:05.468 --> 01:07:07.561
At the opera tonight

01:07:07.637 --> 01:07:10.936
<i>Repo man</i>

01:07:11.007 --> 01:07:13.635
<i>- Repo man
- Freezel</i>

01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:15.302
At the opera tonight

01:07:15.378 --> 01:07:21.544
Repo man, come take my hand

01:07:21.617 --> 01:07:23.551
At the opera tonight

01:07:23.619 --> 01:07:25.678
Repo Man

01:07:25.755 --> 01:07:28.417
My eyes

01:07:28.491 --> 01:07:32.086
<i>Repo man, at the opera tonight</i>

01:07:35.298 --> 01:07:36.788
Bloodbath

01:07:36.866 --> 01:07:39.164
It's gonna be a bloodbath

01:07:39.235 --> 01:07:41.294
'Cause no one crosses GeneCo

01:07:41.371 --> 01:07:43.839
No, not even Repo

01:07:43.906 --> 01:07:45.931
Will Rotti clean house?

01:07:46.008 --> 01:07:48.306
Damn, we're gonna find out

01:07:48.378 --> 01:07:49.675
At the opera

01:07:49.746 --> 01:07:51.008
Stay tuned.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.446
The winner of this blood feud

01:07:53.516 --> 01:07:55.484
Will take GeneCo

01:07:55.551 --> 01:07:56.813
<i>Tonight's opera</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

Everybody, everybody

Get down, get down now

01:08:38.027 --> 01:08:39.153
Stand up

01:08:39.228 --> 01:08:40.252
Don't be shy

01:08:40.328 --> 01:08:41.455
People, people, people

01:08:43.198 --> 01:08:44.461
Everybody, everybody

Everybody testify

01:08:57.846 --> 01:09:01.840
GeneCo helped me upgrade
my second-class heredity!

01:09:01.917 --> 01:09:03.475
Testify!

01:09:03.553 --> 01:09:04.884
My liver was wrecked,

01:09:04.953 --> 01:09:07.252
but now I can drink whatever I want!

01:09:07.323 --> 01:09:08.415
Testify!

01:09:08.491 --> 01:09:09.582
Before GeneCo,

01:09:09.658 --> 01:09:12.752
my anatomy was completely repressed!

01:09:18.301 --> 01:09:21.464
State your names!

01:09:22.471 --> 01:09:24.633
Genterns.

01:09:31.413 --> 01:09:33.506
Saved!

01:09:33.582 --> 01:09:35.448
Everybody, everybody

01:09:35.518 --> 01:09:37.281

01:09:37.353 --> 01:09:38.979
Stand up and don't be shy

People, people, people,
get up, get up, get up

01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:45.158
Everybody, everybody, testify

01:09:45.228 --> 01:09:48.857
I needed a kidney
transplant desperately

01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:53.390
GeneCo showed this
single mom sympathy

01:09:53.469 --> 01:09:57.701
This makeover came
for a small added fee

01:09:57.773 --> 01:10:03.541
Now I look smashing on live TV

01:10:04.614 --> 01:10:07.344
- Be healed!
- GeneCo's got it.

01:10:07.416 --> 01:10:09.077
You know you want it, baby.

01:10:09.151 --> 01:10:10.618
GeneCo's got it.

01:10:10.686 --> 01:10:11.880
You know you want it, baby.

01:10:11.954 --> 01:10:13.546
GeneCo's got it.

01:10:13.623 --> 01:10:14.851
You know you want it, baby.

01:10:19.362 --> 01:10:21.091

01:10:42.818 --> 01:10:44.251
Testify!

01:10:54.797 --> 01:10:57.095
<i>Shilo, uou've made it.</i>

01:10:57.166 --> 01:10:59.760
<i>You're close enough to taste it.</i>

01:10:59.835 --> 01:11:02.133
<i>Your cure, is waiting.</i>

01:11:02.204 --> 01:11:04.001
<i>There is but one thing pending.</i>

01:11:04.073 --> 01:11:06.598
<i>Help us catch him.</i>

01:11:06.676 --> 01:11:08.644
<i>This former GeneCo trainee</i>

01:11:08.711 --> 01:11:10.941
<i>who's lost his mind completelu</i>

01:11:11.013 --> 01:11:12.742
<i>and managed to escape me.</i>

<i>You saw him</i>

01:11:15.818 --> 01:11:19.811
<i>In the graveuard</i>

01:11:19.889 --> 01:11:22.187
<i>Thank God mu guards responded.</i>

01:11:23.693 --> 01:11:25.786
<i>It seems this fiend has
set his teeth on uou,</i>

01:11:25.861 --> 01:11:28.386
<i>so be on guard. He's coming.</i>

01:11:28.464 --> 01:11:29.726
<i>We'll use uou as bait</i>

01:11:29.799 --> 01:11:32.165
<i>to draw this snake out of his hole,</i>

01:11:32.234 --> 01:11:34.225
<i>and I am sorru, Shilo, for that,</i>

<i>Will uou let uourself be trapped,</i>

01:11:39.208 --> 01:11:42.234
<i>or will uou use uour trap to trap him?</i>

01:11:42.311 --> 01:11:43.835
<i>Put uour hands together</i>

01:12:02.832 --> 01:12:06.563
Blame not my cheeks

The pair with love they be

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.361
<i>Bring me Repo Man,</i>

<i>GeneCo proudlu presents Blind Mag.</i>

01:15:13.489 --> 01:15:18.927
Come take these eyes

01:15:21.931 --> 01:15:29.599
I would rather be blind

01:16:01.503 --> 01:16:03.494
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, don't panic.</i>

01:16:03.572 --> 01:16:06.370
<i>Stau in uour seats.
It's all part of the show.</i>

01:16:06.442 --> 01:16:07.500
Stay tuned, folks

01:16:07.576 --> 01:16:09.100
You don't want to move, folks

01:16:09.178 --> 01:16:11.772
'Cause there's more
excitement coming

01:16:11.847 --> 01:16:15.112
As an encore, GeneCo will cure

01:16:15.184 --> 01:16:17.652
A very sick and needy young girl

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.382
She's been caged up like a monster

01:16:20.456 --> 01:16:22.924
By her overbearing father

01:16:22.992 --> 01:16:25.927
But tonight we're gonna set him right

01:16:25.995 --> 01:16:28.623
And for all your viewing pleasures

01:17:00.562 --> 01:17:03.554
Didn't I tell you not to go out?

01:17:03.632 --> 01:17:04.758
Didn't I?

01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:07.233
You did, you did

01:17:07.303 --> 01:17:10.295
Didn't I say the world was cruel?

01:17:10.372 --> 01:17:11.430
Didn't I?

01:17:11.507 --> 01:17:13.372
You did, you did

01:17:13.442 --> 01:17:16.741
Then tell me how this happened

01:17:16.812 --> 01:17:19.975
What I did wrong, tell me why

01:17:20.049 --> 01:17:23.610
Can't we just go home, Shi

01:17:23.686 --> 01:17:26.849
And forget this dreadful night?

01:17:26.922 --> 01:17:30.289
Didn't you say that you were different?

01:17:30.359 --> 01:17:31.451
Didn't you?

01:17:31.527 --> 01:17:33.392
I am, I am

01:17:33.462 --> 01:17:36.829
Say you aren't that person

01:17:36.899 --> 01:17:38.196
Say it

01:17:38.267 --> 01:17:39.700
I am, I am

01:17:39.768 --> 01:17:43.363
Then tell me how to act, Dad

01:17:43.439 --> 01:17:46.306
What to say, Dad, tell me why

01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:49.902
All you've ever told me

01:17:49.979 --> 01:17:57.351
Every word is a lie

01:18:08.097 --> 01:18:11.123
Didn't you say that you'd protect me?

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.326
Didn't you?

01:18:12.401 --> 01:18:13.925
I tried, I tried

01:18:14.003 --> 01:18:17.029
Is that how you'd help me?

01:18:17.106 --> 01:18:18.869
Is it?

01:18:18.941 --> 01:18:19.999
I tried, I tried

01:18:20.075 --> 01:18:23.340
Don't help me anymore, Dad

01:18:23.412 --> 01:18:26.040
You are dead, Dad, in my eyes

01:18:26.115 --> 01:18:29.050
Someone has replaced you

01:18:29.118 --> 01:18:31.814
Dad, I hate you, go and die

01:18:31.887 --> 01:18:34.981
Didn't I build a house, a home?

01:18:35.057 --> 01:18:36.183
Didn't I?

01:18:36.258 --> 01:18:38.123
<i>A cure is waiting.</i>

01:18:38.193 --> 01:18:40.991
Didn't I raise her all alone?

01:18:41.063 --> 01:18:42.257
Didn't I?

01:18:43.732 --> 01:18:47.133
Then Rotti took her from me

01:18:47.202 --> 01:18:49.830
Stole my Shilo, he's to blame

01:18:49.905 --> 01:18:54.103
Have I failed my daughter?

01:18:54.176 --> 01:18:57.873
Then let the father die

01:19:01.183 --> 01:19:08.817
And let the monster run

01:19:14.696 --> 01:19:19.599
<i>Repo Man</i>

01:19:36.218 --> 01:19:37.845
Stop!

01:19:42.691 --> 01:19:45.319
You've exceeded all my plans

01:19:45.394 --> 01:19:48.261
More than you
could say for Amber

01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:50.560
More than I could say for you.

01:19:50.632 --> 01:19:52.099
What?

01:19:52.167 --> 01:19:54.465
Or your just-as-worthless brother

01:19:56.038 --> 01:19:58.336
I just want to get my cure

01:19:58.407 --> 01:20:00.807
And I promise to deliver

01:20:00.876 --> 01:20:02.935
Don't you lay a hand on her.

01:20:03.011 --> 01:20:04.808
Hold your tongue before an elder.

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:07.246
Touch her, and I swear I'll kill you.

01:20:07.316 --> 01:20:09.443
Bring it on, you cheap imposter.

01:20:12.654 --> 01:20:16.613
Even though I'm terminally ill

01:20:17.893 --> 01:20:19.417
I'm dying, you idiots.

01:20:19.495 --> 01:20:20.621
Please don't say you're dying, Father.

01:20:20.696 --> 01:20:22.027
Please say you ain't dying, Father.

01:20:22.097 --> 01:20:24.088
So I planned my perfect end

01:20:24.166 --> 01:20:26.157
A tale befitting any opera

01:20:26.235 --> 01:20:28.760
And ending only I could spin

01:20:28.837 --> 01:20:30.702
Ending you will be my pleasure.

01:20:30.772 --> 01:20:32.672
I no longer trust you, Dad.

01:20:32.741 --> 01:20:34.936
You can never trust a monster.

01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:37.171
And there's more beneath his mask.

01:20:40.549 --> 01:20:43.677
Did you know he killed your mother?

01:20:43.752 --> 01:20:46.414
It was just an accident

01:20:46.488 --> 01:20:50.117
- Accidents can end in murder.
- Shilo, believe me

01:20:50.192 --> 01:20:52.922
And that's not his greatest fib

01:20:52.995 --> 01:20:55.691
Someone tell me what is going on

01:20:55.764 --> 01:20:57.664
Tell her, tell her

01:20:57.733 --> 01:20:59.530
Someone tell me what is going on

01:20:59.601 --> 01:21:01.262
- Let's leave
- Tell her, tell her

01:21:01.336 --> 01:21:03.531
- Let's leave
- Someone tell me what is going on

01:21:03.605 --> 01:21:05.368
- No more
- Tell me, tell me

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.670
- Tell her, tell her
- Tell me

01:21:07.743 --> 01:21:08.732
No more.

01:21:10.245 --> 01:21:13.840
May I introduce you

01:21:13.916 --> 01:21:18.444
To the man who made you sick?

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:26.325
He's poisoned all your medicine

01:21:31.466 --> 01:21:34.435
- I can't breathe
- You've got to fight through it.

01:21:34.503 --> 01:21:38.371
Someone, please,
please help my daughter

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:41.375
This will pass.
You've got to fight through it.

01:21:41.443 --> 01:21:44.708
I've deceived the only one that matters

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:46.179
- I need my pill.
- You need to know

01:21:46.248 --> 01:21:47.738
- You've got to fight.
- It's not your fault

01:21:47.816 --> 01:21:48.748
Believe me, Shilo.

01:21:48.817 --> 01:21:49.875
It's me who failed you

01:21:49.952 --> 01:21:51.419
My stomach.

01:21:51.486 --> 01:21:53.886
- It's his medicine
- My medicine

01:21:53.956 --> 01:21:54.923
It's your medicine?

01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.922
I'm the cause

01:21:55.991 --> 01:21:57.390
Of all your sickness

01:22:06.401 --> 01:22:08.699
<i>Here's to the medi...</i>

01:22:13.041 --> 01:22:16.272
<i>That's all there is</i>

01:22:16.345 --> 01:22:18.040
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

01:22:52.848 --> 01:22:56.944
Your mother once
promised her love to me

01:22:57.019 --> 01:23:00.785
Had she never fled, you'd be mine.

01:23:00.856 --> 01:23:03.290
Deny your father now,

01:23:03.358 --> 01:23:05.656
for the world to see.

01:23:06.728 --> 01:23:08.787
Kill him.

01:23:08.864 --> 01:23:10.593
Kill him!

01:23:10.666 --> 01:23:11.792
No.

01:23:11.867 --> 01:23:13.027
And I'll leave you GeneCo

01:23:13.101 --> 01:23:15.001
- What?
- All of it?

01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:16.298
Oh, yes.

01:23:16.371 --> 01:23:17.360
Oh, no!

01:23:17.439 --> 01:23:18.872
So witness it, people.

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:21.431
All I have to do is sign the paper

01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:24.604
All you have to do is pull the trigger

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:27.979
- I want you to do what is right
- You want to pay me

01:23:28.050 --> 01:23:30.314
- to kill my father?
- This man killed your mother, your mother

01:23:30.385 --> 01:23:33.320
- Shilo
- He betrayed you both, he's a liar

01:23:33.388 --> 01:23:35.856
- And he poisoned you
- Force me to kill

01:23:35.924 --> 01:23:38.290
I am not a murderer

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.794
But you share your dad's genetics

01:23:40.862 --> 01:23:42.921
What if he passed this to you?

01:23:42.998 --> 01:23:45.091
I don't have to share his choices

01:23:45.167 --> 01:23:47.192
Didn't you say you were infected?

01:23:47.269 --> 01:23:49.965
Didn't you, didn't you?

01:23:52.407 --> 01:23:54.500
I poisoned you

01:23:54.576 --> 01:23:57.739
I'm worse than Rotti, imprisoned you

01:23:57.813 --> 01:24:01.510
I couldn't lose you,
what have I done?

01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:05.576
Forgive me, Shilo,
I drugged your blood

01:24:05.654 --> 01:24:08.555
Oh, God, what have I done to you?

01:24:08.623 --> 01:24:12.491
You used my mother's death
to use my father

01:24:12.561 --> 01:24:16.088
You used my father's death
to use me, too

01:24:16.164 --> 01:24:19.998
Your dad deserved
whatever happened to him.

01:24:20.068 --> 01:24:22.332
He needed me, and so do you.

01:24:22.404 --> 01:24:25.771
I remember

01:24:27.209 --> 01:24:29.109
Remember my mistakes

01:24:29.177 --> 01:24:31.372
Remember you can change

01:24:31.446 --> 01:24:34.745
Remember that I love you

01:24:34.816 --> 01:24:38.718
I'm sorry that I failed you

01:24:38.787 --> 01:24:42.553
Remember that it's up to you

01:24:42.624 --> 01:24:47.357
To go and shape your life into

01:24:47.429 --> 01:24:49.329
One that's worthy of remembering

01:24:51.867 --> 01:24:53.300
No!

01:24:59.508 --> 01:25:00.736
Dad!

01:25:00.809 --> 01:25:03.607
Dad, no, please!

01:25:03.678 --> 01:25:05.441
Somebody!

01:25:05.514 --> 01:25:07.778
Somebody, please help.

01:25:07.849 --> 01:25:10.613
Money-grubbing beggars,
no better than I am.

01:25:10.685 --> 01:25:13.813
You! Don't come near me.
You're embarrassing.

01:25:13.889 --> 01:25:15.948
You're disgusting.

01:25:16.024 --> 01:25:17.787
You're not men. You're creatures.

01:25:17.859 --> 01:25:18.985
I'm embarrassed by you.

01:25:21.897 --> 01:25:24.559
Get away. I don't need you,
not either one of you.

01:25:24.633 --> 01:25:26.123
Go away!

01:25:29.204 --> 01:25:31.764
Don't show your face to me.

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.171
You're disgusting.

01:25:33.241 --> 01:25:34.401
You're not my daughter.

01:25:34.476 --> 01:25:35.636
You're nothing.

01:25:44.386 --> 01:25:47.219
When I'm gone, GeneCo will crumble.

01:25:49.424 --> 01:25:51.517
I doubt the world will remember

01:25:51.593 --> 01:25:55.689
how lucky they were
to have Rotti Largo.

01:26:13.148 --> 01:26:16.208
Dad, be still

01:26:16.284 --> 01:26:19.481
There is nothing you need say

01:26:19.554 --> 01:26:22.455
It can wait

01:26:25.026 --> 01:26:28.928
Shi, your mother's calling me

01:26:32.133 --> 01:26:35.159
Sometimes I wanted to cry

01:26:35.237 --> 01:26:38.001
When the people on TV

01:26:38.073 --> 01:26:40.405
Were not quite the way we were

01:26:40.475 --> 01:26:43.501
Somehow I guess I just knew

01:26:47.883 --> 01:26:52.047
But I didn't know I love you so much

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:59.384
I didn't know I love you so much

01:26:59.461 --> 01:27:01.486
But I do

01:27:04.232 --> 01:27:07.065
Sometimes I'd stay up all night

01:27:08.370 --> 01:27:10.099
Wishing to God

01:27:10.171 --> 01:27:12.332
That I was the one who died

01:27:12.407 --> 01:27:16.366
And sometimes there's
not enough time

01:27:19.915 --> 01:27:23.681
But I didn't know I love you so much

01:27:23.752 --> 01:27:31.520
I didn't know I love you so much

01:27:31.593 --> 01:27:33.618
But I do

01:27:36.331 --> 01:27:47.672
I didn't know I love you so much

01:27:47.742 --> 01:27:49.607
But I do

01:27:51.346 --> 01:27:53.837
Shilo, go

01:27:53.915 --> 01:27:56.941
Dad, I will not leave you here

01:27:57.018 --> 01:27:59.009
You will live

01:27:59.087 --> 01:28:02.784
But you've already saved me, dear

01:28:02.857 --> 01:28:06.156
Go and change the world for me

01:28:07.562 --> 01:28:10.588
And we will always have each other

01:28:10.665 --> 01:28:13.065
In our time of need

01:28:13.134 --> 01:28:14.294
- Daddy
- Shilo

01:28:14.369 --> 01:28:15.461
You're the world

01:28:15.537 --> 01:28:17.528
To me

01:28:21.776 --> 01:28:24.939
Oh, Daddy, please, no.

01:28:25.013 --> 01:28:27.743
Please, please.

01:28:32.787 --> 01:28:34.049
Please, get up.

01:28:36.925 --> 01:28:38.153
Please.

01:28:52.774 --> 01:28:54.799
Years

01:28:54.876 --> 01:28:57.674
It's been so many years

01:28:57.746 --> 01:29:00.874
Resenting the years

01:29:00.949 --> 01:29:03.975
And my heredity

01:29:05.687 --> 01:29:10.454
Oh, I have hated and loved you

01:29:10.525 --> 01:29:13.858
I have hidden behind you

01:29:13.928 --> 01:29:17.056
But I finally see

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:23.401
You I've mistaken for destiny

01:29:23.471 --> 01:29:26.406
But the truth is my legacy

01:29:26.474 --> 01:29:30.535
Is not up to my genes

01:29:30.612 --> 01:29:35.447
True, though the imprint is deep in me

01:29:35.517 --> 01:29:39.044
It will always be up to me

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:42.487
Up to me

01:29:51.466 --> 01:29:54.492
Free at last

01:30:02.844 --> 01:30:09.340
Free at last

01:30:41.483 --> 01:30:43.951
Goth opera

01:30:44.018 --> 01:30:46.213
Blood saga

01:30:47.555 --> 01:30:51.685
Sometimes I wonder
how we ever got here

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:54.285
Old grudges

01:30:54.362 --> 01:30:56.159
Scorned lovers

01:30:57.632 --> 01:31:01.659
Sometimes I wonder
why we all don't move on

01:31:01.736 --> 01:31:04.899
'Cause we all wind up
in a tiny pine box.

01:31:04.973 --> 01:31:07.464
A mighty small drop
and a mighty dark plot.

01:31:07.542 --> 01:31:08.839
And the mighty fine print

01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:11.470
hastens the trip to our epilogue.

01:31:11.546 --> 01:31:12.604
Epilogue?

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.704
But the little girl fled,

01:31:13.782 --> 01:31:14.942
and the king is dead.

01:31:15.016 --> 01:31:17.280
And the castle is left for the taking.

01:31:17.352 --> 01:31:21.220
But GeneCo may survive
if it undergoes surgery,

01:31:21.289 --> 01:31:22.449
surgery.

01:31:22.524 --> 01:31:24.822
Surgery, surgery.

01:31:24.893 --> 01:31:27.191
- Surgery.
- Surgery.

01:31:33.668 --> 01:31:36.068
<i>Repo Man.</i>

01:31:42.610 --> 01:31:43.941
<i>Out from the...</i>

01:31:44.012 --> 01:31:46.207
Our heroes will not be forgotten.

01:31:47.382 --> 01:31:50.545
GeneCo will live on,
under new management.

01:31:51.719 --> 01:31:53.016
Me.

01:31:53.087 --> 01:31:56.989
<i>Prau he never comes

Amber Sweet, ladies and gentlemen.

01:32:01.996 --> 01:32:03.463
Amber Sweet.

01:32:03.531 --> 01:32:05.260
I can't hear you.

01:32:05.333 --> 01:32:07.358
I can't fucking hear you,
you fucking peasants!

01:32:07.435 --> 01:32:09.232
You gonna start applauding?

01:32:13.975 --> 01:32:16.409
I'll kill you all, you fucking mice!

01:32:17.478 --> 01:32:18.638
Dad.

01:32:18.713 --> 01:32:24.652

<i>Close to the line hupe of the sku?</i>

01:33:03.524 --> 01:33:08.291
<i>Or is it better from a distance</i>

01:33:08.363 --> 01:33:10.991
<i>To see it clear?</i>

01:33:11.065 --> 01:33:13.329
<i>To deal with uour fear</i>

01:33:13.401 --> 01:33:18.634
