00:17.851 --> 00:19.269
[narrator] <i>Michael Bluth had discovered</i>

00:19.353 --> 00:22.856
<i>that a feature story about him
<i>had appeared in a magazine.</i></i>

00:22.940 --> 00:23.815
Hi. Hello.

00:23.899 --> 00:25.859
Hey. Where are you heading today, sir?

00:25.943 --> 00:27.569
[narrator]
<i>It was only available on airplanes.</i>

00:27.653 --> 00:30.322
Actually, I just want a copy
of your in-flight magazine <i>Altitude.</i>

00:30.405 --> 00:33.450
This is ticketing.
You can get the magazine on the flight.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.662
I get it. But I'm actually...
I'm in the magazine.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.704
How many bags?

00:39.540 --> 00:40.624
I'm not checking these.

00:40.958 --> 00:43.335
Sorry, you actually
can't carry those on board.

00:43.835 --> 00:44.962
Let me start over.

00:45.087 --> 00:48.507
I am the star of <i>Altitude magazine
this month.</i>

00:48.590 --> 00:50.926
Or quarter actually.
It's an April-September issue.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.219
I just want a copy.

00:52.302 --> 00:56.139
[narrator] <i>Michael hoped the article would
<i>generate interest in his housing business,</i></i>

00:56.265 --> 00:58.350
<i>which had been going through a dry spell.</i>

00:58.475 --> 01:00.769
<i>This, combined with some other misfortunes</i>

01:00.852 --> 01:03.772
<i>had led Michael to sacrifice some
<i>of his privacy</i></i>

01:04.064 --> 01:06.024
<i>and move into the dormitory of his son...</i>

01:06.108 --> 01:07.442
Name one way we're different.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.361
[narrator]
<i>...with whom he'd always been close.</i>

01:09.444 --> 01:12.531
<i>But as exciting as the news
<i>about his magazine article was...</i></i>

01:12.614 --> 01:15.117
They're gonna be in seat backs today?
That's great news.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.452
[narrator]
<i>It was tempered by the intrusion...</i>

01:17.536 --> 01:19.788
Probably doesn't have it.
Tried finding a flight?

01:19.871 --> 01:21.790
[narrator]
<i>...of George Michael's other roommate.</i>

01:21.873 --> 01:23.500
Ever been on a plane, you [bleeps]

01:24.668 --> 01:27.129
[narrator] <i>It was the desire
<i>to be closer to his son...</i></i>

01:27.212 --> 01:28.338
P-Hound was suggesting

01:28.422 --> 01:31.592
that maybe we do a vote
to see who stays in the dorm room.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.260
Right, then he's gone in seconds.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.096
[narrator] <i>...that led Michael to embrace
<i>the voting idea as his own.</i></i>

01:36.179 --> 01:37.306
We gotta do it.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.558
-Not flying anywhere.
-Why do you have suitcases?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.893
-Those are irrelevant.
-Not to me.

01:42.144 --> 01:42.978
Okay.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.647
[narrator] <i>The suitcases were part
<i>of a series of solutions</i></i>

01:45.731 --> 01:47.274
<i>that Michael implemented...</i>

01:47.357 --> 01:48.942
It puts me in an awkward position.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.403
Everyone's going to know
who voted against who.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.698
[narrator]  <i>...to Salvage a highly fraught
<i>voting scheme.</i></i>

01:54.990 --> 01:56.325
What if I vote myself out?

01:56.408 --> 01:58.994
[narrator] <i>As whenever he found a solution
<i>to one problem...</i></i>

01:59.077 --> 02:00.287
Wouldn't that be a tie?

02:00.370 --> 02:01.705
[narrator] <i> ...another problem emerged.</i>

02:01.788 --> 02:02.706
All right, new plan.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.542
If it's two votes against me,
then P-Hound is being nasty...

02:05.626 --> 02:07.002
[narrator] <i>Then more problems...</i>

02:07.085 --> 02:08.045
Vote against P-Hound.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.297
-[narrator] <i>And so on.
-We all pack ahead of time.</i>

02:10.380 --> 02:13.133
Really pack a bag,
so it doesn't look rigged, you know?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.344
[narrator]
<i>So Michael can't be blamed for feeling...</i>

02:15.469 --> 02:18.555
I was mistakenly voted out
of a four-person housing situation

02:18.639 --> 02:20.932
in a pack-first,
no-talking-after scenario.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.142
Does that clear it up?

02:22.517 --> 02:24.186
What do you mean by "mistakenly"?

02:24.269 --> 02:27.856
[narrator] <i>The mistake was not realizing
<i>it was actually his son's idea...</i></i>

02:27.939 --> 02:30.359
-I voted against myself...
-...vote against himself.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.569
[narrator]
<i>...to get Michael to vote against himself.</i>

02:32.653 --> 02:34.404
Vote his own father out of his dorm.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.823
But that leaves three other votes.

02:37.949 --> 02:38.784
Michael.

02:38.909 --> 02:39.743
Michael.

02:39.910 --> 02:40.744
Michael.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.791
-Can I get a magazine, please?
-No, I'm sorry.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.334
They're actually for passengers.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.212
We don't even give out nuts,
so we can't give you a magazine.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.172
-Who wants nuts?
-I don't want nuts.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.883
I want to just jump onto the plane,
grab a magazine.

02:54.966 --> 02:58.011
Okay, sure. We just let people walk
onto the plane all the time.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.514
Do you want a box cutter also?

03:01.598 --> 03:02.432
Nice.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.017
These guys are jerks.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.435
I got your back.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.021
[man] <i>Attention passengers for flight...</i>

03:08.397 --> 03:11.400
Tell you what, give me a ticket
to your cheapest destination, please.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.276
[narrator]
<i>So, Michael found his seat...</i>

03:14.528 --> 03:16.738
<i>with no seat back in front of him.</i>

03:16.822 --> 03:17.698
Hello. Hi.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.742
Does each ticket entitle the passenger
to an in-flight magazine?

03:21.076 --> 03:22.619
No, it only guarantees you a seat.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.705
Perhaps I can ask
another passenger for one,

03:24.788 --> 03:26.123
or if I'd rather, you can.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.960
[narrator] <i>Michael had to go back four
<i>seats before someone would.</i></i>

03:31.211 --> 03:32.879
<i>And Michael kicked himself</i>

03:32.963 --> 03:35.424
<i>for a pose he thought
<i>would express humility</i></i>

03:35.507 --> 03:39.261
<i>to Sanjiv, the Altitude <i>photographer.</i></i>

03:40.887 --> 03:42.806
<i>Now the story of what happened</i>

03:42.889 --> 03:46.268
<i>when the one man
<i>who was holding his family together</i></i>

03:46.727 --> 03:48.061
<i>finally let go</i>

03:48.353 --> 03:51.440
<i>and the separate journeys
<i>that eventually gave them no choice...</i></i>

03:51.815 --> 03:53.150
<i>but to come back together.</i>

03:53.233 --> 03:55.193
<i>It's Arrested Development...</i>

03:55.569 --> 03:56.945
Fateful Consequences.

04:00.782 --> 04:04.578
<i>Michael was a man who, for years,
<i>had threatened to leave his family</i></i>

04:05.454 --> 04:07.456
<i>but had always stayed for his son.</i>

04:07.664 --> 04:09.875
<i>But now he no longer had that excuse</i>

04:10.584 --> 04:12.085
<i>nor anywhere to live</i>

04:12.586 --> 04:17.132
<i>and he found himself with nothing to lose
<i>in a town that he'd always imagined...</i></i>

04:17.799 --> 04:19.760
<i>would be his destiny.</i>

04:20.802 --> 04:23.221
<i>And for the first time
<i>in many years,</i></i>

04:23.847 --> 04:25.807
<i>Michael had hope.</i>

04:28.852 --> 04:30.562
<i>George Sr. also had hope...</i>

04:30.645 --> 04:31.646
[Herbert] <i>...to build a wall...</i>

04:31.730 --> 04:35.233
[narrator] <i>...because he had purchased
<i>a large swath of desert property</i></i>

04:35.317 --> 04:38.236
<i>where his twin brother
<i>was living with a bunch of weirdos.</i></i>

04:38.320 --> 04:39.446
Watch us make love?

04:39.529 --> 04:43.116
[narrator] <i>Yet despite making his brother
<i>think he was purchasing it for him...</i></i>

04:43.200 --> 04:44.034
We're staying?

04:44.117 --> 04:48.038
[narrator]<i> He bought it so he could
<i>low bid a government border wall project</i></i>

04:48.121 --> 04:49.372
<i>he was hoping to build.</i>

04:49.456 --> 04:51.166
We offer to build it for 150 million

04:51.249 --> 04:53.752
and we make up the difference
when we sell the land.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.253
If you support the wall...

04:55.337 --> 04:58.965
[narrator] <i>Which is why he needed
<i>to persuade a fairly right-wing politician</i></i>

04:59.049 --> 05:01.635
<i>to make it a third point
<i>in his three-point plan.</i></i>

05:02.052 --> 05:03.261
All I got right now is,

05:03.345 --> 05:06.097
you want to reach into my pocket
to pay for your birth control?

05:06.348 --> 05:08.809
I get to put my hand in your pocket
to put it in.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.852
Yeah, but when I unveiled it
in Garden Grove,

05:10.936 --> 05:13.313
I had to duck a woman's pump
and a mini pizza.

05:14.022 --> 05:14.856
Oops.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.317
[narrator]
<i>So it was a big victory for George Sr.</i>

05:17.400 --> 05:19.402
<i>-who'd been feeling emasculated of late.
-[cheering]</i>

05:19.569 --> 05:23.114
<i>And aside from hating the wrinkles he saw

05:34.918 --> 05:37.003
What the [bleeps] is he smiling about?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.005
Hello.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.300
Oh, we're doing a survey
for the US government, ma'am.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.469
Oh, no, I'm a man.

05:44.636 --> 05:47.222
I was just wearing this blouse

05:47.305 --> 05:49.558
because I was driving, and I hate my arms.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.226
What's the tape for?

05:51.309 --> 05:54.312
Laying out border coordinates
for when they put up the wall.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.857
You're not supposed to tell him
what it's for.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.651
Well, he already mentioned the tape,
and he looks American.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.236
Yeah, but he's in Mexico.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.698
Wait. Guys, no.
Mexico starts back there by the gully.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.659
Whoever told you that
is probably chomping on the maca.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.745
So, what you're saying
is that on this side of the tape,

06:10.829 --> 06:11.872
I'm in Mexico,

06:12.122 --> 06:13.373
but when I come over here--

06:13.456 --> 06:15.458
Whoa! We're gonna need
to see a passport, sir.

06:15.792 --> 06:16.668
<i>Pasaporte.</i>

06:17.127 --> 06:20.297
[narrator] <i>George Sr. liked to make
<i>men who disappoint him suffer.</i></i>

06:22.716 --> 06:23.758
<i>But things change...</i>

06:23.842 --> 06:26.303
You really hurt my feelings, guys.
[sobbing]

06:26.761 --> 06:28.555
-No touching, ma'am.
-I'm sorry.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.474
[narrator] <i>And George wasn't the only one

-Don't touch that.

Oh! Mother of God!

06:46.865 --> 06:50.118
Dear Lord! Whoo!

[Barry] <i>Hey, Michael.</i>

07:24.903 --> 07:26.696
<i>-You're in real estate again?
-Sort of.</i>

07:26.780 --> 07:29.407
[narrator] <i>Michael had tried

07:29.491 --> 07:31.451
<i>and get a job in the high-tech sector.</i>

07:31.534 --> 07:34.204
However, I will tell you that
in my last position,

07:34.287 --> 07:35.914
I had a company car provision.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.500
We may have something
that can get you a car.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.627
-Hey, Gare-Bear?
-Yeah?

07:40.710 --> 07:41.920
I think we got an ostrich.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.421
-Oh, God, grab him.
-What is it?

07:43.505 --> 07:46.925
Now, with this car,
you may get some stares.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.969
I'm used to a car
with some stairs.

I'm actually working in high tech,

08:05.402 --> 08:06.611
This is gonna be low.

08:07.612 --> 08:08.655
Oh, I hooked it.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.906
[narrator] <i>Michael was driving a car</i>

So, I got a really interesting call

He's directing now, apparently,

08:42.480 --> 08:44.149
Why does Ron Howard want to meet me?

08:44.232 --> 08:45.734
His office didn't say,

I will meet with him.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.415
-You're in front of a jury now?
<i>-And the looks I'm getting. Got to go.</i>

09:00.665 --> 09:02.625
Sorry, everybody.
I'm an attorney, too.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.003
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

09:05.086 --> 09:07.213
I'd like the defendant

09:07.464 --> 09:10.592
open it from the inside
and enter the school property, please.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.970
I can't reach it.
I can't reach the Chachi.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.848
If he can't reach,
this trial's a breach.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.142
Ooh, and that's what we call a law bomb.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.643
That's a low blow, Loblaw.

09:20.769 --> 09:21.853
A Bob Loblaw law bomb.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.315
[narrator] <i>As a client,
<i>Barry was hoping for a better fate</i></i>

09:25.398 --> 09:28.109
<i>than that of his own client,
<i>Lucille Bluth,</i></i>

<i>who, while being an inmate</i>

09:29.778 --> 09:33.740

09:37.786 --> 09:38.703
Talk about the wall.

09:38.787 --> 09:41.831
[narrator] <i>And in retribution
<i>to a brother who lied to him...</i></i>

09:42.499 --> 09:45.043
So we only did buy that land
for personal gain. Well!

09:45.126 --> 09:46.753
[narrator] <i>Oscar chose to lie...</i>

09:48.046 --> 09:49.881
-[narrator] <i>With George's wife.
-Call me Father B.</i>

09:51.049 --> 09:54.469
[narrator] <i> And although too explicit
<i>for an American audience,</i></i>

09:54.552 --> 09:56.763
<i>the lovemaking was intense and beautiful</i>

09:57.347 --> 09:59.849
<i>but for one small misunderstanding</i>

09:59.933 --> 10:01.559
<i>that occurred during the afterglow.</i>

10:02.769 --> 10:03.603
No.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.689
I mean, it's good
to be out of that sweaty old hot box

10:06.773 --> 10:07.857
at the compound.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.526
-No, this was amazing.
-Oh.

10:10.235 --> 10:13.488
[narrator] <i>And Oscar finally got more
<i>information about his brother's plans.</i></i>

10:14.030 --> 10:16.199
We may need to have
a president ready to go

10:16.491 --> 10:20.036
if something should happen to Lucille 2
while we're building the wall.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.038
So we are building a wall.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.416
Right where Oscar
thought he would be spending

10:25.500 --> 10:26.584
the rest of his life.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.921
[laughs] Turn him around three times,
put him in Fullerton.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.965
-He won't know the difference.
-Fullerton.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.135
You know, I think we should
send our son down there.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.179
Give him some training,
show that he has a job.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.347
Let him sweat a little.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.809
Buster? No. I won't hear of it.
It could kill him.

10:43.810 --> 10:44.811
I meant Gob.

10:45.228 --> 10:48.064
Oh! Fine.
Yeah, send him down. I love that.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.067
[narrator]
<i>But not before an ominous warning.</i>

10:51.151 --> 10:54.070
But, you know, he has magical abilities.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.532
He can handle a lot more
than we give him credit for.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.783
I know.

10:59.909 --> 11:00.743
What?

11:01.327 --> 11:05.081
[narrator]<i> In fact, Gob hadn't been
<i>feeling magical at all lately.</i></i>

11:05.165 --> 11:08.459
<i>Ever since he wasn't able to open
<i>a secret compartment.</i></i>

11:08.543 --> 11:10.086
<i>that held handcuff keys,</i>

11:10.587 --> 11:13.965
<i>at a wedding to a religious girlfriend
<i>he was hoping to escape from.</i></i>

11:14.549 --> 11:18.595
<i>And all in front of homosexual
<i>rival illusionist Tony Wonder.</i></i>

11:18.678 --> 11:20.680
<i>With his own career in shambles,</i>

11:20.930 --> 11:24.684
<i>Gobs understandably excited
<i>to receive a call from his mother.</i></i>

11:24.767 --> 11:28.479
<i>It's your mother. We're going to plan B.
<i>Go see your father in the desert.</i></i>

11:28.563 --> 11:31.816
<i>He wants you to prepare
<i>to be president of the Bluth company.</i></i>

11:31.900 --> 11:33.943
Finally. I will not disappoint you, Mom.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.571
I am the perfect person
to look out for this family.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.739
[horn honks]

11:37.822 --> 11:39.699
[narrator]
<i>But earlier that day, it was Michael</i>

11:39.782 --> 11:41.910
<i>who was entering the world
<i>of show business,</i></i>

11:42.619 --> 11:45.038
<i>as he arrived at Imagine Entertainment,</i>

11:45.288 --> 11:48.708
<i>the modest film, television
<i>and streaming colossus</i></i>

11:48.875 --> 11:50.877
<i>of Brian Grazer and Ron Howard.</i>

11:51.002 --> 11:54.047
<i>And he got his first taste
<i>of how cruel Hollywood can be.</i></i>

11:54.130 --> 11:55.256
That's not very nice.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.092
"Ankles" means "leaves"
in <i>Variety, Michael.</i>

11:58.551 --> 12:01.304
Kitty Sanchez.
What are you doing here?

12:01.512 --> 12:04.682
I work here. I'm a D girl.
No, I don't want to see them.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.310
I'm not going to show you my [bleeps]
you pig.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.020
It means "development."

12:09.229 --> 12:12.398
I'm a movie executive.
I work for Ron Howard now.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.817
[narrator]
<i>And she'd proven as loyal to him</i>

12:14.901 --> 12:17.779
<i>as she was to her former boss,
<i>Michael's father.</i></i>

12:17.862 --> 12:20.531
<i>But without
<i>the quote, unquote, "benefits."</i></i>

12:20.740 --> 12:23.368
Do you have any idea
why Ron Howard wants to see me?

12:23.451 --> 12:25.578
Believe me,
if I could think like Ron Howard,

12:25.662 --> 12:28.331
I'd own the second largest building
in Beverly Hills.

12:28.456 --> 12:32.001
[narrator]<i> Only Jerry Bruckheimer's
<i>building was technically taller.</i></i>

12:32.669 --> 12:34.337
<i>But who wants to be south of Wilshire?</i>

12:34.420 --> 12:36.297
-Mr. Howard will see you now.
-Oh, great.

12:36.381 --> 12:37.674
I'll take you to the private elevator.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.467
Going to meet the big man himself.

12:39.634 --> 12:43.012
[narrator]<i> But first, Michael
<i>would have to pass a few little Rons.</i></i>

12:43.513 --> 12:44.347
[woman] Michael Bluth.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.975
-[Michael] Hey.
-[Ron] Hey, nice try, mister.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.061
-We can't beat the original.
-That's what I said.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.312
-Hi. Hey.
-Oh, Michael.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.897
Hey! Thanks for coming down.

12:52.981 --> 12:55.733
I'm finishing up casting this
<i>Andy Griffith Show thing.</i>

12:56.234 --> 12:58.861
Hang on a second.
Are you guys finally making that movie?

12:58.945 --> 13:00.822
I've been reading about it for 40 years.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.950
Well, it's not a done deal yet,
but I want to talk about you.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.743
-Yeah.
-Hey, let's go inside the LEM.

13:05.827 --> 13:06.661
You want to?

13:07.161 --> 13:09.247
Is this the one that landed on the moon?

13:09.580 --> 13:12.041
-On a soundstage.
-Oh, right, from  Apollo 13.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.710
No, 1969.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.462
NASA did go to the moon in '71

13:16.671 --> 13:18.589
but in '69, they weren't ready,

13:18.923 --> 13:22.427
so they faked the whole thing
on the soundstage of  <i>Gentle Ben.</i>

13:22.760 --> 13:23.594
Boy.

13:23.678 --> 13:26.764
Me and my brother hid up in the rafters.
We seen the whole thing.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.516
But I want to talk to you.

13:28.683 --> 13:29.517
Okay.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.478
For the last year,
I've been going to Phoenix.

13:33.688 --> 13:37.567
Whoa. Hang on, now. Are you kidding me?
I'm a Phoenix....

13:37.650 --> 13:43.323
I've never met anyone else in person
that also goes there. That's amazing.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.742
That's the downside
of going to college online, huh?

13:45.825 --> 13:47.785
Well, I've just got a sick aunt
down there.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.037
-But...
-Oh, I see.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.288
On the last flight,

13:50.455 --> 13:52.707
I was flipping through the magazine,
and I...

13:53.041 --> 13:55.918
-I saw something.
-No, not the begging photo.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.255
I don't think you know this about me,
but most of my movies

13:59.380 --> 14:02.467
are based on<i>still photographs
that I find truly inspiring.</i>

14:02.675 --> 14:03.885
[narrator]<i> It was true.</i>

14:03.968 --> 14:07.555
Splash <i>was based on what turned out
<i>to be a counterfeit Hockney</i></i>

14:07.805 --> 14:10.016
<i>that Brian talked Ron into buying.</i>

14:10.600 --> 14:12.977
The Da Vinci Code
<i>was from this photo.</i>

14:14.395 --> 14:15.229
You know <i>Willow?</i>

14:15.313 --> 14:18.191
That was from a Soft 'n' Snuggly
coupon I got in the mail.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.235
But a man who is passionate enough to beg?

14:21.778 --> 14:25.073
Well, that's a character
whose story we really want to see.

14:25.156 --> 14:28.910
I've been dying to figure out a way
to do something about the market crash

14:28.993 --> 14:31.329
ever since my partner Brian Grazer
was tipped off

14:31.412 --> 14:33.039
that it was three months away
from happening.

14:33.122 --> 14:33.956
What's that?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.750
But I never had a face to put on it.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.668
Until now. You.

14:38.336 --> 14:39.712
Your wife is dying.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.756
You're trying to hold
your family together.

14:41.839 --> 14:46.177
Oh, gosh, no.
My wife died years before any of this.

14:47.470 --> 14:48.304
Oh, gee.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.600
I think it's a lot more
fun if we see her die.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.810
That is fun.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.021
And by the way, then it's a fantastic part
for a leading lady.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.191
In fact, my girl Rebel
would be great in that part.

15:00.525 --> 15:01.484
Your girl?

15:01.818 --> 15:04.112
Rebel Alley. She's an actress.
You know her.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.029
[narrator]<i> He didn't.</i>

15:05.113 --> 15:07.907
I do. Yes, of course I do.
Your girl, huh?

15:07.990 --> 15:09.909
Well, we like to keep that quiet.

15:09.992 --> 15:13.913
[narrator]<i> Michael assumed "my girl"
<i>was referring to his mistress...</i></i>

15:13.996 --> 15:15.790
I see why you're telling me in the LEM.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.584
[narrator]<i> ...but Ron was actually talking
<i>about his daughter.</i></i>

15:19.961 --> 15:22.672
You probably think I'm terrible
for even mentioning her.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.549
No, I'm not one to judge.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.884
I'm sure you've all got girls here
in Hollywood.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.302
Brian's got two boys.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.186
[narrator]<i> Michael was suddenly given
<i>the great opportunity</i></i>

15:37.270 --> 15:38.646
<i>to make something of himself.</i>

15:38.729 --> 15:40.731
You're a natural.
It could be a great movie.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.317
It's a real chance
to show you guys off, too.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.611
Us guys?

15:45.695 --> 15:47.447
Well, it's about the whole family.

15:48.072 --> 15:48.906
Them?

15:48.990 --> 15:52.869
We're gonna need everybody's signature
on these releases in order to make this.

15:52.994 --> 15:56.456
Although the real heartbeat of this thing
is the father-son dynamic.

15:56.539 --> 16:00.001
Yeah. You know, Ron,
I don't know if I can do this.

16:00.543 --> 16:03.588
We're not in a great way right now,
and it might not be worth...

16:03.671 --> 16:06.174
Take a few of these cards
and really think about it.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.759
-All right.
-I got a tough meeting coming up now.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.013
How do you tell Ed Harris
that he's simply not a Barney?

16:13.097 --> 16:15.641
[narrator]
<i>And while Ed was getting some bad news...</i>

16:16.476 --> 16:17.643
Am I a producer?

16:18.102 --> 16:19.645
[narrator] <i>Michael got some good news,</i>

16:20.396 --> 16:23.107
<i>which he promptly shared
<i>with the family attorney.</i></i>

16:23.191 --> 16:25.318
They want me to get
the family's signatures,

16:25.401 --> 16:27.653
especially my father's.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.406
Sounds like your thing
went a lot better than my thing.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.284
<i>Except, I haven't spoken to them
<i>for a long time.</i></i>

16:33.367 --> 16:36.537
I mean, since I...
Well, since my mom...

16:36.621 --> 16:38.498
-Left?
-[camera shutter clicks]

16:38.581 --> 16:41.292
Yeah, for prison.
You want to know what?

16:41.375 --> 16:42.752
Frankly, I think Ron Howard

16:42.835 --> 16:45.087
just wants to get a movie
for his girlfriend.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.924
It sounds like Ron Howard is casting
with his [bleeps]

16:48.508 --> 16:51.135
Well, it is hard to believe,

16:51.219 --> 16:53.387
but I guess
they've all got their mistresses

16:53.471 --> 16:55.014
up here in showbiz, you know?

16:55.097 --> 16:56.849
It's like it's their God-given...

16:56.933 --> 16:57.975
-Front?
-No, right.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.020
-No, right.
-Calm down, everybody. I got it.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.314
You think my dad would ever go for this?

17:03.397 --> 17:05.608
It's very hard
to get a signature out of him.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.693
It's like somebody,
a long time ago, said...

17:07.860 --> 17:11.239
What if you never sign anything,
and say you don't have a signature?

17:11.322 --> 17:13.658
-Just like you, Pop.
-You don't have a signature?

17:13.741 --> 17:15.201
No. He's never given me one card.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.410
Not one birthday card,

17:16.494 --> 17:18.996
which is why his presents
are money orders, right?

17:19.080 --> 17:20.331
I don't have a signature.

17:20.623 --> 17:24.460
Oh!
If you don't sign, you will be fine. Hey!

17:24.544 --> 17:26.963
Barry, I hear what you're saying.
My dad would never do this for me.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.049
I'm gonna head back in
and tell Ron Howard to forget about it.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.467
<i>-Yeah, you're screwed.
-Yeah.</i>

17:31.551 --> 17:32.510
<i>-Do me a favor.
-Okay.</i>

17:32.593 --> 17:34.804
-Bye, Barry.
<i>-Tell Ron to shove his waffle iron--</i>

17:34.887 --> 17:37.098
-Oh!
-Sorry. Oops. Whoa, sorry.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.058
-My fault. Looking at my phone.
-No.

17:39.141 --> 17:42.478
That's not too embarrassing walking around
with photographs of yourself.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.605
Well, it's part of your job.
You're an actress, huh?

17:44.689 --> 17:47.233
Yeah. Actually actress
is an overstatement because--

17:47.316 --> 17:50.653
Oh, thank you. I was just sucking
at this audition I went on.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.739
It was one of these ridiculous
meet-cute cliches,

17:53.823 --> 17:57.243
when a guy and a girl just bump
into each other, and they...

17:58.160 --> 17:59.328
They fall in love.

18:00.496 --> 18:01.581
God, you're handsome.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.626
I got maybe a lucky hair day.
You're the beautiful one.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.129
You have beautiful eyes.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.090
My deceased wife had red hair.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.969
Yep, garbage like that
and it's so unbelievable.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.013
Like they never get each other's names.

18:17.138 --> 18:17.972
Pretty stupid.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.600
-Oops. Gosh.
-Oh. Ow!

18:20.683 --> 18:22.310
-Are you okay?
-That really hurt.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.687
I wish I'd done that well in the audition.

18:24.770 --> 18:25.605
[Michael laughs]

18:25.688 --> 18:27.732
Where's a movie producer
when you need one, right?

18:27.815 --> 18:29.275
It was really nice to meet you.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.276
Yes, you, too.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.279
I'm a movie producer.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.781
Sorry. I'm a movie... Here, I've got...

18:36.157 --> 18:38.075
I got proof here, huh?

18:38.159 --> 18:39.744
-You are a movie producer.
-Yeah.

18:39.827 --> 18:43.164
Yeah, there's a part for a wife,
and you'd be perfect for the movie.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.249
-[Michael] Huh.
-[laughs]

18:45.666 --> 18:47.501
Do you like Scottish music?

18:47.585 --> 18:50.963
With the screeching horns and the silly--

18:51.047 --> 18:52.173
Yeah. I'm in a band.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.424
I love it. It's great.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.801
We're playing at the Ealing Club
tomorrow night.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.803
Maybe you could come
and just check it out.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.847
Oh, yeah? I don't even know what that is.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.599
[laughing]

19:01.724 --> 19:03.017
Sorry. That's funny.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.311
I should have said, "Where?"
I know what it is.

19:05.394 --> 19:09.899
No, it's on the top of that building,
but can you imagine driving that car?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.359
No, I can't. No.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.073
-[Gob] Get away!
-[horn honks]

19:17.156 --> 19:17.990
Sorry.

19:45.851 --> 19:46.686
Hello, Father.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.646
Don't call me that.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.147
What are you doing here?

19:50.231 --> 19:52.149
-You and Mom talked about it.
-We did?

19:52.441 --> 19:53.275
Oscar.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.946
I'd have been earlier, but I had to go
to San Diego and loop back

19:57.029 --> 20:00.616
because of that border ribbon,
which is new, and I wasn't expecting it.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.493
It's fine. Anyway, Father,

20:02.576 --> 20:06.288
You've got to give me a job
so I can be prepared to be president.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.748
You gotta keep this "father" stuff
to yourself.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.584
I can't have these people
think I raised a limo driver.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.002
I'm not a limo driver.

20:12.461 --> 20:15.589
I'm a gentleman honey farmer.
The only thing back there are my bees.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.007
-Beans?
-No, bees.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.634
-Peas?
-Bees.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.845
Bees! Oh, bees!

20:20.928 --> 20:24.348
The boxes fell over on the way
when I swerved to avoid an ostrich.

20:24.432 --> 20:27.309
You've got to do something.
These people paid a lot of money.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.353
They won't listen to me.
They've got CCD.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.522
-CCD?
-Colony Collapse Disorder.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.482
The guy sold me just really sick bees.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.527
Don't worry. Dad, they're gonna hive.
They always hive.

20:36.694 --> 20:40.239
[narrator]<i> Usually by seeking out
<i>a structure that most resembles a hive.</i></i>

20:40.406 --> 20:42.491
Bees. Wonderful bees.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.409
It's okay.

<i>Then George Sr. got some more bad news.</i>

20:46.078 --> 20:49.749
Hello, brother.<i>Thought I'd find you
in a blouse and a beekeeper hat.</i>

20:49.832 --> 20:52.752
What are you doing here?
No. We can't be seen next to each other.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.128
I'm Dr. Norman.

20:54.587 --> 20:58.132
Well, if you don't want to be seen,
then you go in the sweat lodge.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.759
You owe me.

20:59.842 --> 21:00.676
Is that a fact?

21:00.760 --> 21:04.096
Listen, you told me
the property was on the border.

21:04.180 --> 21:07.099
It is 50 feet south of the border, Oscar.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.852
Well, excuse me,
but they hadn't put up the tape yet,

21:09.935 --> 21:11.187
and you lied to me.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.689
You told me
you bought this property to live on.

21:13.773 --> 21:17.193
No, you bought this property
to put up a wall.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.694
I told one lie,

21:18.778 --> 21:20.946
but I was going to share the money
with you.

21:21.030 --> 21:21.864
Two lies.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.785
And why do I think that you charge
more than $5 for lemonade?

21:25.868 --> 21:27.787
Three small lies.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.747
Now do me a favor. Just get in the tent.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.833
Gob's getting rid of the bees.
We'll push the matinee to 3:00.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.085
No, I'm sick and tired
of being in that hut

21:35.169 --> 21:36.754
pretending to be you.

21:36.837 --> 21:40.299
Maybe I should go out there
and pretend to be you.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.302
So, goodbye, George.
This is the last you'll see of me.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.347
I'm just gonna use the can
for one second.
