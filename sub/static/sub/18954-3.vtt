'Each life is a journey

00:34.520 --> 00:38.790
'defined by the turns we
take and the roads we choose

00:38.840 --> 00:41.380
'or which fate chooses for us.'

00:43.160 --> 00:46.910
- Morning, Mr Chen.
- Morning, Miss Gilbert.

00:46.960 --> 00:51.150
'Some travel geographically,
trading home for home,

00:51.200 --> 00:53.710
'and one language for another.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.150
'But we all move from youth to maturity,

00:57.200 --> 01:02.310
'childhood to parenthood, as if
we were traversing continents.

01:02.360 --> 01:06.830
'The world shifts and the climate alters.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.190
'Safe passage cannot be bought

01:09.240 --> 01:12.640
'and we have no holy
passport to protect us.'

01:21.200 --> 01:24.200
It will be your turn very soon, Mr Chen.

01:29.760 --> 01:34.550
'And so we venture forward,
fragile maps in hand

01:34.600 --> 01:38.270
'flying our banners of
courage and of hope.'

01:38.320 --> 01:40.190
Oh, dear, Patrick

01:58.120 --> 02:01.470
- Good morning, Dr Turner.
- Good morning, Sister.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.630
Erm, I'm afraid you'll
have to excuse me --

02:03.680 --> 02:05.670
I'm on my way to a meeting.

02:05.720 --> 02:09.110
I imagine that would be the
meeting at the Board Of Health.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.960
About Mr Powell's new Hospital Plan.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.510
Yes, it is.

02:13.560 --> 02:18.190
There are interesting implications
for our district, I suspect.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.840
Which is why I've decided
that I ought to attend.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.550
Well, I imagine you'd like a lift, Sister.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.470
Thank you. That would be appreciated.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.720
Well? Do we pass the test?

02:46.920 --> 02:48.870
Approved for home birth.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.990
Thanks, Nurse. See, Ma,
I told you she was nice.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.190
Nurse Gilbert's from Liverpool like me.

02:55.240 --> 02:58.550
We have to talk about your plan
for afterwards, once baby's here.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.190
After baby comes it's zuo yue zi.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.910
It's the Chinese thing she wants me to do.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.870
Zuo yue zi means "sitting the month".

03:05.920 --> 03:07.510
It's confinement.

03:07.560 --> 03:10.430
Me and the baby stuck in here for 30 days

03:10.480 --> 03:13.420
with my mother-in-law looking after us.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.630
You don't sound terribly keen.

03:15.680 --> 03:20.550
It's just strange to me, that's
all, Nurse. Me mam was English.

03:20.600 --> 03:24.350
It's me dad who's Chinese and
I've not seen him since I was five.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.670
They deported him in '46.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.390
That's awful.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.510
Anyway, it's not how I was brought up.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.550
But I've said I'll do it.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.920
Well, so long as you're
sure, we'll support you.

03:41.040 --> 03:44.430
30 days is a very long time
for bed rest, isn't it?

03:44.480 --> 03:47.950
Proper hygiene after the birth
though -- on that we must insist,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.750
no matter what Mrs Chen Sr says.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.590
We don't want any nasty infections.

03:52.640 --> 03:56.470
I have a feeling that Mrs Chen
Sr might be a bit of a handful.

03:56.520 --> 04:01.150
I really hope Lucy can cope.
That's my biggest worry, actually.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.230
It's an awfully small flat.

04:03.280 --> 04:06.030
Chinese customs are quite complicated.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.230
I'm not sure Lucy feels
particularly Chinese.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.280
And that's at least part of the trouble.

04:14.440 --> 04:18.120
- I hope I'm not late.
- Not at all. Successful trip?

04:19.200 --> 04:21.269
A couple of blouses, thank goodness.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.470
Some of my clothes are barely decent now.

04:23.520 --> 04:27.390
Including my uniform, which
is rather embarrassing.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.670
I also got this.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.990
I wasn't going to buy anything yet.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.740
It seemed like tempting
fate. But it was so lovely.

04:36.040 --> 04:39.340
And I gave away most
of Angela's baby things.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.630
You're almost halfway through, Shelagh.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.590
You should be starting to prepare.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.110
Enjoy it.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.310
Oh, hello. How was your meeting?

04:51.360 --> 04:54.950
Eventful. They're trying to close us down.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.030
What?!

04:56.080 --> 04:59.830
It appears that the new Hospital
Plan For England And Wales

04:59.880 --> 05:03.070
wants to move women away from
small maternity homes like this one

05:03.120 --> 05:06.390
- and into big general hospitals.
- Oh, my goodness.

05:06.440 --> 05:10.150
We're to be inspected, apparently,
and then they decide our fate.

05:10.200 --> 05:13.750
They can't shut us down, we're
busy, there's obviously a need.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.440
Enoch Powell thinks otherwise,
as does Sister Ursula.

05:18.480 --> 05:21.550
But we're not going down without a fight.

05:21.600 --> 05:25.910
Shutting maternity homes across
the country -- whatever next?

05:25.960 --> 05:29.390
Only a man could think it's a good idea.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.230
Quite apart from anything else,

05:31.280 --> 05:33.670
it's going to lead to an
increase in hospital births.

05:33.720 --> 05:37.590
Hospital is the best environment
if specialist help is required.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.630
And, if it is not, a woman's home
should be perfectly adequate.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.950
With the greatest respect, Sister Ursula,

05:43.000 --> 05:46.430
some of the homes in Poplar
aren't adequate at all.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.990
Exactly, Sister.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.790
It's one of the reasons I opened
the home in the first place.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.990
And why it's still needed. Desperately.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.150
So...

05:55.200 --> 05:57.950
how long do we have and what
are we going to do about it?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.470
They haven't given us
much notice, I'm afraid.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.950
A little over a week.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.750
But we have drawn up a plan of action.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.830
The building itself
needs some minor repairs,

06:07.880 --> 06:09.990
so Fred will be seeing to all of that.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.310
On his own time, I assume.

06:12.840 --> 06:17.150
As you will see from the sheet, we
are then going to gather as many

06:17.200 --> 06:21.870
statistics on the maternity home as
we can get our hands on and present

06:21.920 --> 06:25.670
the inspector with black and white
evidence of our achievements so far.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.910
And how can we help?

06:26.960 --> 06:30.510
Just keep doing exactly what you've
been doing since the home opened.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.590
Providing our mothers and
babies with the very best care.

06:33.640 --> 06:37.430
We are very short of staff
at present, Mrs Turner.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.590
There have been departures

06:39.640 --> 06:43.140
and we still await the
return of Nurse Franklin.

06:43.640 --> 06:47.670
I'm afraid the maternity home
cannot be our principle concern.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.990
We too are under scrutiny.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.110
I think she's done now.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.230
Thank you, Mrs Evans.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.760
You can come in now.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.190
Morning, ladies.

07:19.240 --> 07:22.540
It's this one here. The
wheel keeps sticking.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.190
Sorry, Mrs Collier, we'll
try not to get in your way.

07:26.240 --> 07:29.070
That's all right. I ain't going anywhere.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.390
Any day now, Mrs Collier.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.550
Well, it looks easy
enough to fix, Mrs Turner.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.630
Good. Thank you, Fred.

07:38.680 --> 07:41.630
Right. Shall we see how
that blood pressure is today?

07:41.680 --> 07:44.390
You want to send that inspector in to me.

07:44.440 --> 07:45.870
I'll tell him what I think of him.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.390
Trying to get this place closed down.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.680
I'm not sure that would do anyone's
blood pressure much good, Mrs Collier.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.750
This is much better, though.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.390
135 over 85. Good for you.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.790
Not in uniform today, Mrs Turner?

08:00.840 --> 08:02.510
No. Not today.

08:10.880 --> 08:14.630
Good morning, Sister. Are
you looking for something?

08:14.680 --> 08:16.030
May I help you?

08:16.080 --> 08:18.270
No, thank you, Nurse Crane.

08:18.320 --> 08:22.020
I am merely making some
improvements to the roster.

08:24.440 --> 08:28.350
And what improvements might
those be, Sister Ursula?

08:28.400 --> 08:32.230
I'm introducing a 20-minute
time limit to all antenatal,

08:32.280 --> 08:34.750
postnatal and district calls.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.990
But, Sister, that's half
the time we usually allow.

08:38.039 --> 08:42.270
A 20-minute visit is ample time
for checks and small procedures.

08:42.320 --> 08:46.950
And it will enable each of you to
see three extra patients in a day.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.470
It may be ample time in a
hospital situation, Sister,

08:50.520 --> 08:53.230
but not in district practice, I'm afraid.

08:53.280 --> 08:56.840
Perhaps you would find it useful
to come out with us, Sister?

08:59.040 --> 09:04.270
My role here is to ensure the running
of Nonnatus House is efficient.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.310
Sadly, I have personal experience
of what happens to institutions

09:07.360 --> 09:09.630
that are deemed otherwise.

09:10.640 --> 09:14.440
20 minutes, please. It's for the best.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.510
I'm going to get a frame for this.

09:28.560 --> 09:32.260
Put me mam and dad up beside
your picture of Cyril.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.990
The baby can grow up
seeing them all together

09:37.040 --> 09:39.640
and work out who they look like.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.790
Shall I get a new frame for this one too?

09:47.840 --> 09:49.750
Going to fall to bits soon.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.990
Nothing wrong with frame. Leave it.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.710
Are you sure?

10:00.000 --> 10:04.280
Oh, Ma. You kept a piece of
his baby hair. That's lovely.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.390
I'm going to do that too.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.680
I said leave it. I will fix it.

10:17.920 --> 10:22.350
I'm sorry, Sister, I realise
this is an inopportune moment

10:22.400 --> 10:24.390
but I must speak with you.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.470
Of course. What is it?

10:26.520 --> 10:30.790
This 20-minute ruling imposed
on us by Sister Ursula

10:30.840 --> 10:33.190
is completely impractical.

10:33.240 --> 10:36.150
We are not machines and
nor are our patients.

10:36.200 --> 10:41.710
District practice has variables
that precludes such a rigid approach.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.790
We're treading a very fine line here.

10:44.840 --> 10:51.270
I am not certain that Sister
Ursula is altogether fit to be

10:51.320 --> 10:53.460
making these decisions.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.630
Nurse Crane...

10:58.680 --> 11:02.950
Sister Ursula was matron at
the Order's cottage hospital

11:03.000 --> 11:06.070
when it was closed for
inefficient practice.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.870
She took it very badly,
blaming herself entirely.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.590
I see.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.910
Sister Ursula's ways are different.

11:13.960 --> 11:17.060
But we must support her and show willing.

11:19.560 --> 11:23.280
Who knows? Maybe we'll all be surprised.

Oh, no.

Every "i" on these records is going
to be dotted and every "t" crossed.

12:38.360 --> 12:42.230
Dad, have they really
started closing places down?

12:42.280 --> 12:47.230
Not here. Not yet. But we can't
take anything for granted.

12:47.280 --> 12:50.670
Sister Ursula was Matron at a
Cottage Hospital that closed.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.910
That might have been because of her.

12:52.960 --> 12:55.230
I'm sure it was more
complicated than that.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.990
Mrs Henderson is on her way in.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.590
I'll go and get her settled.

12:58.640 --> 13:03.310
Oh, looks like I'll be on Beatrix
Potter duty tonight, young lady.

13:03.360 --> 13:06.910
And make sure it's Mrs
Tiggy-Winkle or the Flopsy Bunnies.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.900
No Squirrel Nutkin.

13:09.800 --> 13:14.150
Shelagh. Shouldn't we call
someone over from Nonnatus House?

13:14.200 --> 13:16.110
I don't want you doing too much.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.560
I'm in fine fettle, Patrick.

13:22.120 --> 13:26.080
Besides, I don't want to give Sister
Ursula the pleasure of saying no.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.590
Can you wait, Nurse?

13:31.640 --> 13:33.990
I'm really sorry but it'll get ruined.

13:34.040 --> 13:37.190
It's me who should be
sorry for being so late.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.230
Oh, come and join us.
Please. I've made plenty.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.880
- Oh, er...
- Let me take this.

13:43.320 --> 13:46.510
All right. That's very kind.

13:46.560 --> 13:49.100
I'll be late for my tea anyway.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.350
What this?

13:52.400 --> 13:55.710
Well, you're always complaining
about me Chinese cooking,

13:55.760 --> 13:58.300
so I've made something English.

14:01.920 --> 14:05.470
It's called... toad-in-the-hole.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.270
Toad?!

14:07.320 --> 14:09.990
Well, not really. It's a sausage.

14:16.360 --> 14:18.230
What's she saying?

14:18.920 --> 14:21.790
- Cyril? - Nothing. - It looks lovely.

14:33.030 --> 14:34.030
It would appear that

14:34.080 --> 14:37.670
neither Nurse Gilbert nor Sister
Monica Joan are intending to

14:37.720 --> 14:39.230
join us this evening.

14:39.280 --> 14:42.190
I must say, it's most unlike
Sister Monica Joan to miss

14:42.240 --> 14:45.230
an opportunity for Bakewell tart.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.030
She mentioned a walk.

14:47.080 --> 14:50.110
Another one? I hope she's
not becoming disorientated.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.160
She's become very unsettled since the...

14:54.600 --> 14:56.510
.. television went.

14:56.560 --> 15:01.350
Perhaps the time approaches for our
Sister's retirement to the Mother House?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.830
I'm sure that won't be necessary.

15:03.880 --> 15:08.310
You had to deal with an emergency,
I assume, Nurse Gilbert?

15:08.360 --> 15:10.550
No. Not an emergency.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.190
The 20-minute rule is not optional.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.830
Nor is it something which
applies only to your colleagues

15:15.880 --> 15:20.270
- and not to yourself.
- No, Sister. I'm sorry.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.510
Nonnatus House will not carry
slackers, Nurse Gilbert.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.700
Do I make myself clear?

15:26.680 --> 15:28.280
Yes, Sister.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.870
It won't happen again.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.790
Sister Winifred,

15:38.840 --> 15:42.040
would you be so kind
as to pass the custard?

15:56.080 --> 16:00.110
My mother is nothing
like Mrs Chen, I promise.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.350
She's going to adore you. Like I do.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.830
Well, she isn't going to
have to live with me, is she?

16:06.880 --> 16:08.670
Unless I've missed something?

16:08.720 --> 16:10.680
No. Just us.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.030
I can't wait.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.100
Me neither.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.260
Coming through.

16:23.200 --> 16:27.510
Young Nurse Busby is escaping her
revision by offering all and sundry

16:27.560 --> 16:30.710
- a cup of tea.
- And some toast.

16:30.760 --> 16:34.060
She thinks I haven't
spotted her cunning ruse.

16:34.720 --> 16:38.230
- Violet's jam. First of the year.
- Yes, please.

16:38.280 --> 16:42.120
I believe there's similar excitement in
France with the arrival of the Beaujolais.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.070
Barbara's been telling
me about her evening meal.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.630
My "slacking".

16:48.680 --> 16:51.950
Well, I don't think it's slacking to
try and build up a patient's trust.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.940
Of course it isn't.

16:54.520 --> 16:58.240
You are a good midwife, Barbara,
and I don't want you to forget it.

16:59.280 --> 17:03.110
But for the moment we just
have to do the best we can.

17:03.160 --> 17:06.630
P'raps things will be easier for
you all when Trixie gets back.

17:06.680 --> 17:11.670
I hope so. Right you are,
Nurse Busby. Chop chop.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.800
Back to cephalopelvic
disproportion for you.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.200
- What? What is it?
- Something's happening.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.310
Ma. Ma.

17:48.960 --> 17:52.190
I don't need your mother,
Cyril. I need a midwife.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.120
Go!

18:13.800 --> 18:15.590
This WILL help with the pain.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.720
Just hold the mask over your
face like that. That's it.

18:29.840 --> 18:33.320
Lucy. I'm going to ask your
mother-in-law to come in and help.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.350
Here we are, Mrs Evans.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.630
I'm just going to get a wrench.
Do you want me to answer that?

18:45.680 --> 18:47.950
No, I'll do it, thank you.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.520
Isn't it always the way?

18:51.120 --> 18:53.790
We need to open the
surgery, it's already...

18:53.840 --> 18:56.670
- Is no-one here to
help you again? - No.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.630
Pass them nappies over 'ere, Dr Turner.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.950
I got nothing else to do.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.710
Don't you dare get out
of bed, Mrs Collier.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.760
We'll sort this out.

19:06.840 --> 19:10.830
Another one like that, Lucy,
now. You're doing so well.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.110
Isn't she, Mrs Chen?

19:12.160 --> 19:15.480
Good, strong mother.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.950
That's it.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.720
Lucy, keep breathing... gentle, slowly.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.520
That's it. Head's born, Lucy.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.430
One more gentle push.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.230
That's it.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.950
Congratulations.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.440
You have the most beautiful daughter.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.920
Oh, look at her, Ma.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.510
That's it.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.990
Oh, she's lovely.

20:28.840 --> 20:32.640
What is it, Ma? Do you wish she was a boy?

20:34.240 --> 20:35.380
No.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.920
Girls very special too.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.630
Sister, my wife is spread too thinly.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.910
And although she wouldn't
thank me for the term,

20:55.960 --> 20:58.510
she is an elderly primigravida.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.830
Even if I cannot appeal
to your compassion,

21:00.880 --> 21:05.870
as a professional you must know
that extra strain is unwise.

21:05.920 --> 21:10.870
The Order Of St Raymond Nonnatus
is all compassion, Dr Turner.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.390
But what can I do? The
duties have been allocated.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.510
There is only myself.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.030
She's been out again.

21:28.680 --> 21:31.220
The changes have unsettled her.

21:31.720 --> 21:34.510
You don't think Sister
Ursula meant what she said?

21:34.560 --> 21:36.310
I hope not, Sister.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.070
To leave all that is familiar
would be the very worst thing for

21:39.120 --> 21:40.590
Sister Monica Joan.

21:40.640 --> 21:42.440
Sister Winifred?

21:43.600 --> 21:45.750
May I have your bag, Sister Winifred?

21:45.800 --> 21:50.270
You are to spend the morning at
the Maternity Home with Dr Turner.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.790
Mr Buckle.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.540
I require you to furnish
me with a bicycle.

22:18.680 --> 22:22.390
Draught very bad for you and baby.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.030
Careful with head!

22:25.080 --> 22:27.420
I know, Ma, it's all right.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.310
Do you have a name for her yet?

22:39.360 --> 22:42.150
I want to call her Linda. After me mam.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.190
No, no, no, no.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.870
Very bad luck to have
same name as dead relative.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.190
- Very bad.
- What?!

22:49.240 --> 22:53.110
Not here, Mrs Chen. Here
it's a lovely thing to do.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.300
It's a mark of respect.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.590
It's me mam, Cyril, please.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.390
You want baby to have bad luck?

23:01.440 --> 23:06.440
What about... Lin? A Chinese
name and honours your mother.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.070
I suppose.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.860
But she'll always be Linda in here.

23:26.520 --> 23:28.350
Hells bells!

23:28.400 --> 23:30.270
Patrick. I've told you. I'll do that.

23:30.320 --> 23:34.710
No, no. You're busy. Mending your dress.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.870
It's not a dress, it's my uniform.

23:37.920 --> 23:41.230
And I'm not mending it, I'm
letting it out at the seams.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.470
So that I can look cool, calm,

23:43.520 --> 23:46.560
collected and professional
during the inspection.

23:54.880 --> 23:58.550
We could try being cool, calm,
collected and professional now, really.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.030
Yes, we could

24:00.080 --> 24:02.590
but I'm not convinced that
would speed up my mending,

24:02.640 --> 24:04.380
or your typing.

24:05.520 --> 24:08.200
We'll pull through. We always do.

24:17.240 --> 24:19.710
I'll check on Lin in a minute.

24:21.280 --> 24:24.640
Everything seems to be going
nicely back into place, Lucy.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.230
She seems to be having a nice nap.

24:34.280 --> 24:37.510
At last. Honestly, Nurse. What a night.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.430
I don't think I've ever felt so tired.

24:40.740 --> 24:44.140
I've got this thumping
bloody headache and all.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.390
Ma, not again.

24:49.440 --> 24:55.230
Fish soup. Very good for milk.
Why you take covers off Lin?

24:55.280 --> 24:56.630
No. You'll wake her.

24:56.680 --> 25:00.190
It... It's lovely and
warm in here, Mrs Chen.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.070
I don't think Lin needs a blanket.

25:03.120 --> 25:06.590
All right. I go down to work.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.880
Rest and keep warm.

25:12.960 --> 25:17.120
Nurse... I'm sick of
that bloody fish soup.

25:18.360 --> 25:22.990
Perhaps it's revenge for
the toad-in-the-hole.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.990
Oh, Lucy.

25:25.040 --> 25:28.360
I could pour it away and
open the window, if you like.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.190
I won't tell if you won't.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.550
Oh, Lucy, mothers often
feel down in the dumps

25:57.600 --> 25:59.750
a few days after the birth.

25:59.800 --> 26:04.190
It's horrid but it'll pass, I promise.

26:04.240 --> 26:07.480
- It'll help if you can sleep.
- That's all I want to do.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.550
Oh, I'm so sorry, Lucy.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.910
But I think I'm going
to have to wake Lin up.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.990
I'm only allowed 20 minutes.

26:17.040 --> 26:20.550
Oh, no. Please, Nurse. It
took so long to get her down.

26:20.600 --> 26:24.270
Let her sleep. Please. I'm so tired.

26:24.320 --> 26:28.510
Oh, I really should be going anyway.

26:28.560 --> 26:31.030
We'll be back in the morning.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.310
- Present from Fred
from the allotment. - Ah.

27:09.360 --> 27:12.460
- He says good luck.
- Oh, that's so kind.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.670
Mrs Collier's had a show.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.670
Things are definitely on the move, Mrs T.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.350
Oh, that's good news, isn't it?

27:19.400 --> 27:24.350
Oh. Sorry, Mrs Collier. I've got the
most awful butterflies this morning.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.670
It's so silly.

27:25.720 --> 27:28.230
I thought it must just
be a touch of heartburn,

27:28.280 --> 27:31.310
what with you being in
the family way yourself.

27:31.360 --> 27:34.790
- You can't just come out
and say it. - Why not?

27:34.840 --> 27:36.670
Have you all been speculating?

27:36.720 --> 27:39.470
Speculating? She's been running a book.

27:39.520 --> 27:42.270
Well, I certainly don't approve
of gambling on the premises.

27:42.320 --> 27:46.350
And, yes, I am expecting a
baby and we're delighted.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.070
- Congratulations.
- It's lovely.

27:55.720 --> 27:58.440
No water on skin, only cloth.

28:00.480 --> 28:01.590
Need to be calm.

28:01.640 --> 28:06.950
Ma, I smell. I've got a thumping
headache and I'm too hot.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.790
You've got the bloody
fire on and it's June.

28:09.840 --> 28:12.350
I put fire out when skin dry.

28:12.400 --> 28:16.440
The skin hardly got wet.
I've had enough of this!

28:19.920 --> 28:21.390
Now give me me baby.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.910
You need to be calm.
Lin all right with me.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.590
Give me me baby, Ma.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.680
She's mine, not yours and I
don't want you to have her.

28:36.760 --> 28:40.270
I just think she's too hot, that's all.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.590
I try to do right by you.

28:43.200 --> 28:46.080
To keep you and baby safe and warm.

28:47.440 --> 28:50.180
You such a spoilt, ungrateful girl.

28:51.240 --> 28:55.590
You think lying in bed
for a few weeks is hard?

28:55.640 --> 29:01.320
You have no idea what
hard is! I go to work!

29:02.640 --> 29:03.780
Ma?

29:13.600 --> 29:14.990
This is Dr Turner.

29:15.040 --> 29:18.950
- Doctor, Mr Greenwood from the
Board Of Health. - Dr Turner.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.640
Nice to meet you, Mr Greenwood.
Welcome to the Maternity Home.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.630
Right, er, shall I show you round?

29:26.680 --> 29:28.990
Or would you like a cup
of tea before we start?

29:29.040 --> 29:31.190
We'll get going, shall
we? Quite a lot to do.

29:31.240 --> 29:32.670
Excellent idea.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.830
Please. After you.

29:34.880 --> 29:38.990
I might ask you a few questions about the
background of the place as we go. Is that all right?

29:39.040 --> 29:40.150
Of course.

29:40.200 --> 29:44.830
In fact, I've put together
some information on just that.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.790
I'm can write my own report,
thank you, Dr Turner.

29:47.840 --> 29:50.760
Of course. Please. This way.

29:54.520 --> 29:57.280
Oh. That one was a bugger.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.740
This is Mr Greenwood, everyone.

30:03.280 --> 30:06.230
We have a four-bedded
ward, as you can see.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.910
Three occupied at the moment.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.110
We also have a delivery room,

30:11.160 --> 30:15.790
a nursery and a sterile area
for autoclave and so forth.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.750
It's a lovely place,
Inspector. It's home from home.

30:18.800 --> 30:19.950
Better than MY home.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.120
It don't have my old
man in it for a start.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.630
Mrs Henderson and Mrs Evans
are postnatal patients.

30:27.680 --> 30:31.830
And Mrs Collier -- well, we hope to
meet Mrs Collier's baby later today.

30:31.880 --> 30:34.510
- And this is Nurse Gilbert.
- Hello.

30:34.560 --> 30:41.150
Nurse. Quite an infrastructure,
then, for only four beds.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.750
To be perfectly honest, Dr Turner,

30:43.800 --> 30:48.110
four beds could be absorbed into a
new general hospital in a blink.

30:48.160 --> 30:50.030
You must see that?

31:11.840 --> 31:15.600
Come on then, little one.
You're usually hungry by now.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.360
Lin?

31:23.360 --> 31:24.630
Lin?!

31:29.040 --> 31:31.110
No, no, no, no, no, no. Ma?

31:31.160 --> 31:32.320
Ma!

31:33.360 --> 31:36.960
Ma? Ma? She's not moving!

31:38.840 --> 31:40.240
Oh, God.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.630
Oh, no!

31:47.680 --> 31:49.470
Alive.

31:49.520 --> 31:52.600
What...? What do we do? What do we do?

32:00.280 --> 32:01.420
Ma!

32:08.560 --> 32:12.990
In the four years we've been open,
we've had just over 300 admissions.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.390
Most of them have given
birth on the premises.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.830
Some have been admitted
for postnatal care.

32:17.880 --> 32:22.510
And a handful have been referred on
to hospital for specialist attention.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.430
The thing is, Dr Turner,

32:24.480 --> 32:27.270
the new hospitals will
have beautiful facilities,

32:27.320 --> 32:31.240
the very latest equipment,
access to all specialisms.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.550
How can you compete with that?

32:38.160 --> 32:39.760
Not moving!

32:43.720 --> 32:46.110
- I'll take her in here.
- Why she no move?

32:46.160 --> 32:49.470
The doctor will find
out, Mrs Chen. This way.

32:49.520 --> 32:50.990
Mrs Chen?

32:52.200 --> 32:53.800
Lucy?

32:58.440 --> 33:00.440
Come on, little one.

33:02.960 --> 33:04.630
You can do it.

33:05.480 --> 33:06.880
Come on.

33:13.480 --> 33:14.550
Shall we?

33:14.600 --> 33:18.240
No response to painful
stimuli. Yes, let's try oxygen.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.310
Pulse is very fast.

33:22.360 --> 33:25.660
Mrs Chen's the same and
she's just been sick.

33:25.920 --> 33:29.950
Dr Turner, when I visited
yesterday, Mrs Chen was poorly.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.430
And the baby?

33:31.480 --> 33:33.630
We're only allowed to
stay for 20 minutes now.

33:33.680 --> 33:36.990
The baby was asleep and I didn't
have time to do all the checks.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.470
What was wrong with Mrs Chen?

33:39.520 --> 33:43.150
Bad headache but no
fever. Very out of sorts.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.910
I thought it was being
confined to the room.

33:44.960 --> 33:47.960
It was so stuffy and hot with the fire on.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.030
Look how red her gums are.

33:53.080 --> 33:55.390
Mrs Chen, do you any have gas appliances?

33:55.440 --> 33:59.270
Yes. Fire. Water heater. Cooker.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.590
We need an ambulance right away.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.590
High pulse rate, headaches, irritability.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.580
I think it's carbon monoxide poisoning.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.590
Is there room for Mrs Chen to come too?

34:16.639 --> 34:18.949
No problem, Nurse.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.310
Come on, this way.

34:20.360 --> 34:22.630
Good job with the quick
diagnosis, Dr Turner.

34:22.679 --> 34:26.159
Thank you. Please...

34:39.719 --> 34:42.190
It's not your fault, Barbara.

34:44.120 --> 34:49.110
I should've checked the baby.
I might have seen something.

34:49.159 --> 34:51.070
The headaches, the sealed room.

34:51.120 --> 34:55.150
I-I should've thought of it
but I didn't even smell gas.

34:55.199 --> 34:57.550
Barbara, we don't know how it happened.

34:57.600 --> 35:00.550
But we do know that you should never
have been put in the situation

35:00.600 --> 35:02.840
where there wasn't time.

35:05.320 --> 35:08.070
Look, do you want to go
home? I can manage here.

35:08.120 --> 35:10.960
No. No, I-I want to be here.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.190
Why don't you go and see how
Mrs Collier's getting on?

35:15.240 --> 35:17.110
I'll catch you up.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.390
These are patients currently registered

35:27.440 --> 35:29.710
and their due dates, here.

35:30.680 --> 35:32.630
You can see we're busy.

35:32.680 --> 35:35.350
If I didn't think the
Maternity Home was needed,

35:35.400 --> 35:38.110
I would close it down tomorrow.

35:38.160 --> 35:41.910
So why do you think they
chose to come to you?

35:41.960 --> 35:45.060
Because they want to
stay in the community.

35:45.440 --> 35:48.990
They want the midwives who saw
them through their pregnancy

35:49.040 --> 35:52.190
and they want their
families close at hand.

35:52.240 --> 35:55.790
Without the Maternity Home,
many of our patients would have

35:55.840 --> 36:00.550
the choice between giving birth
in damp, overcrowded housing,

36:00.600 --> 36:03.150
or a bus ride, while
in labour, to a hospital

36:03.200 --> 36:06.000
where their children couldn't visit.

36:07.520 --> 36:11.220
Personally, I don't think
that's any choice at all.

36:12.480 --> 36:16.600
Next question is about how you
would respond to an emergency.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.270
But I think that's been established.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.860
Sadly, yes.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.350
May I?

37:08.880 --> 37:11.270
'Nonnatus House. Midwife speaking.'

37:11.320 --> 37:17.150
Hello, Nurse Crane. It's Shelagh.
I need to get to St Cuthbert's.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.390
Do you think you could give me a lift?

37:19.440 --> 37:21.780
Don't worry, I'm on my way.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.430
Goodness!

37:29.480 --> 37:31.630
That was clever. I
didn't even ring the bell.

37:31.680 --> 37:34.630
Welcome home, Nurse Franklin. I
trust you had a pleasant voyage.

37:34.680 --> 37:37.620
I'm afraid I need you to man the phone.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.240
Sister Julienne?

38:04.920 --> 38:06.790
Lucy.

38:06.840 --> 38:09.030
The doctor say that if she wakes soon

38:09.080 --> 38:12.380
she has a very good
chance of getting better.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.020
But if she doesn't?

38:18.000 --> 38:21.160
Cyril? Cyril?

38:39.920 --> 38:45.110
- We're in the middle of an inspection, Patrick.
One of us has to... - Shelagh. I am taking you.

38:45.160 --> 38:47.390
I'm sure Nurse Crane would
be willing to hold the fort.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.640
- More than willing, Dr Turner.
- Thank you.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.070
Oh. Where's Dr Turner?

39:04.120 --> 39:07.200
Medical emergency, I'm afraid. No matter.

39:08.280 --> 39:11.470
We find the symbiotic
relationship with Nonnatus House

39:11.520 --> 39:14.950
means there's always someone
to take up the baton.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.440
Phyllis Crane, SRN, SCM. Pleased
to meet you, Mr Greenwood.

39:19.480 --> 39:22.720
Now, I believe you'd like to
hear about postnatal care.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.900
Why don't YOU hold her?

39:56.960 --> 40:00.060
Good morning. I'd like
to run some tests...

40:09.040 --> 40:11.590
Now, Nurse Gilbert.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.950
Go home as soon as you're done.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.830
You've had a long day, lass.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.910
Thank you, Phyllis.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.230
I'm dreading telling Sister
Ursula about baby Lin.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.550
No, you leave that to me.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.390
Are you leaving us, Mr Greenwood?

40:30.440 --> 40:33.430
Yes. Shame Dr Turner isn't back yet.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.750
He'll receive a copy
of my report, of course.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.670
I'll let him know.

40:37.840 --> 40:40.430
Would it be completely inappropriate

40:40.480 --> 40:44.790
if one were to inquire as to any
possible conclusions it may contain?

40:44.840 --> 40:47.950
Look... it's a good little place.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.190
Tightly run and serves
its patients very well.

40:51.240 --> 40:55.150
Dr Turner's arguments are
persuasive and his passion

40:55.200 --> 40:56.950
and commitment are admirable.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.670
Yet I sense a "but", Mr Greenwood.

41:00.520 --> 41:04.120
Progress is marching on
in a particular direction.

41:04.760 --> 41:08.350
None of these small places will
be here in ten years' time.

41:08.400 --> 41:13.150
The Maternity Home won't be
recommended for IMMEDIATE closure

41:13.200 --> 41:17.080
but I'm afraid that's the best I can do.

41:20.360 --> 41:24.060
We will content ourselves
with a stay of execution.

41:26.360 --> 41:27.830
Thank you.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.670
- Mr Turner?
- Mr Kenley.

41:43.720 --> 41:47.910
- You did the right thing bringing your wife
in. We're going to admit her. - Thank you.

41:47.960 --> 41:50.350
The bleeding's stopped. For now.

41:50.400 --> 41:54.710
But even with full bed rest, she
may still abort spontaneously.

41:54.760 --> 41:56.630
You do know that?

41:56.800 --> 41:58.800
Yes. I'm a doctor.

42:00.040 --> 42:03.320
It never makes it any easier...
where family are concerned.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.220
No, it doesn't.

42:47.760 --> 42:53.120
In war, when we run away
from Japanese, I pregnant.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.960
I give birth in rain at side of road.

43:00.440 --> 43:02.240
A woman help me.

43:05.880 --> 43:10.160
She put my daughter in my arms.

43:11.840 --> 43:16.110
A daughter? You had a daughter?

43:16.160 --> 43:19.390
She beautiful.

43:19.440 --> 43:21.800
So much black hair.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.940
But we cannot stop.

43:27.360 --> 43:29.230
We walk all night.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.200
I hold her next to my
skin to keep her warm.

43:39.520 --> 43:44.240
But it rain so hard and she get so cold.

43:47.440 --> 43:51.040
Colder and colder and then...

43:54.240 --> 43:55.840
.. she gone.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.150
But before they take her from me,

44:02.200 --> 44:06.270
I bite off a piece of her beautiful hair

44:06.320 --> 44:10.200
and I put it in my pocket,
here, next to my heart.

44:11.920 --> 44:16.360
I still have it. You saw it.

44:20.880 --> 44:29.390
I just want to keep Lin safe and
warm and I nearly lost her too.

44:29.440 --> 44:34.240
Ma. You got her here.

44:56.760 --> 44:59.990
- Good evening, Nurse Crane.
- Good evening, Sister.

45:00.040 --> 45:03.340
Might I trouble you for
a moment of your time?

45:08.040 --> 45:12.470
- You're back.
- Barbara!

45:12.520 --> 45:14.630
I can't tell you how
nice it is to see you.

45:14.680 --> 45:16.750
You too. But where's Patsy?

45:16.800 --> 45:20.040
And what on earth has Sister
Julienne done to her office?

45:22.040 --> 45:23.910
What's the matter?

45:25.800 --> 45:28.270
The baby remains unconscious.

45:32.440 --> 45:34.510
I will pray for them.

45:36.840 --> 45:41.120
I do not want Nurse Gilbert to face
any blame or censure, Sister Ursula.

45:42.400 --> 45:45.190
She was in a situation
where her hands were tied.

45:45.240 --> 45:49.070
20 minutes is enough time for
postnatal checks, Nurse Crane.

45:49.120 --> 45:50.550
We both know that.

45:50.600 --> 45:54.390
It's enough time in a hospital
where all you see is the patient

45:54.440 --> 45:55.990
and their symptoms.

45:56.040 --> 45:59.720
But in district practice one
must take in the bigger picture.

46:01.360 --> 46:04.600
I'm afraid it wasn't enough
time for Lucy and Lin Chen.

46:07.800 --> 46:11.990
I thank you for your
frankness, Nurse Crane.

46:12.040 --> 46:15.340
You have given me much
upon which to reflect.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.990
Thank you, Sister Ursula.

46:26.040 --> 46:29.070
No-one doubts your good intentions.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.390
We all want a tight ship.

46:39.560 --> 46:44.630
You should never have been put in a situation
where you couldn't use your clinical judgment.

46:44.680 --> 46:49.630
- Sister Julienne would never
do anything like that. - I know.

46:49.680 --> 46:52.080
We'll have to say something.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.110
Good evening.

47:00.240 --> 47:01.750
Nurse Franklin, I presume.

47:01.800 --> 47:05.310
Yes. Good evening, Sister Ursula.

47:06.860 --> 47:08.930
No, I won't interrupt.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.360
I simply wish to commiserate
with Nurse Gilbert.

47:16.520 --> 47:19.390
I understand you had a difficult day.

47:20.200 --> 47:21.800
I apologise.

47:23.360 --> 47:25.230
Thank you, Sister.

47:26.920 --> 47:30.390
The condition of Baby Chen
remains unchanged, I'm afraid.

47:30.440 --> 47:33.310
I will inform you if there's any news.

47:34.800 --> 47:39.760
And the 20-minute appointment
system will be reviewed.

48:06.240 --> 48:08.180
Sister Monica Joan?

48:12.880 --> 48:14.220
Sister?

48:20.720 --> 48:22.060
Sister?

48:29.600 --> 48:31.950
Ah, evening, Sister. You're
just in the nick of time.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.400
Come on.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.600
Sister?

48:56.080 --> 48:59.080
What are you doing here? It's very late.

49:02.680 --> 49:04.150
(Silence.)

49:06.760 --> 49:08.710
Is...? Is that our television set?

49:08.760 --> 49:11.840
Sh. It's starting.

49:18.800 --> 49:21.270
He really is very old.

49:21.320 --> 49:23.600
- Who is?
- Mr Steptoe.

49:28.200 --> 49:30.870
It's beautiful, Barbara. Perfect.

49:34.840 --> 49:40.390
Mmm. Ah. Tea tastes so
much better in Poplar.

49:40.440 --> 49:42.180
Nurse Franklin.

49:47.760 --> 49:50.280
We are complete.

49:51.320 --> 49:52.350
Iced buns.

49:52.400 --> 49:56.230
Sister Monica Joan, where have you
been? I was getting very worried.

49:56.280 --> 50:00.510
Let us simply say, the mystery
of the television has been solved.

50:00.560 --> 50:04.590
It was given to the Seaman's
Mission. Where's Sister Ursula?

50:04.640 --> 50:08.440
We must ask her to join us
for this happy gathering.

50:09.040 --> 50:13.520
Sister Ursula appears to have embarked
upon a regimen of prayer and fasting.

50:26.080 --> 50:29.790
I'm sorry, Sister, would
you prefer solitude?

50:29.840 --> 50:34.840
No. I would be grateful for your
company and for your prayers.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.940
Though I fear I am undeserving of both.

50:40.560 --> 50:43.560
No-one is undeserving of a prayer, Sister.

50:46.960 --> 50:49.900
A baby lies close to death in hospital.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.350
But when I kneel to pray for her

50:52.400 --> 50:55.400
I find I cannot stop the
entreaties on my own behalf.

50:57.920 --> 51:01.960
How will God hear the prayers for
the child in all the clamour?

51:03.480 --> 51:06.840
God hears it all, Sister. You know that.

51:10.400 --> 51:13.600
I failed in my last
mission. That is a fact.

51:15.120 --> 51:17.990
I failed the Order. And I failed Him.

51:18.400 --> 51:23.320
In Nonnatus House I
saw... a second chance.

51:24.840 --> 51:30.550
I told myself I was making a gift
of myself, to the Order, a gift of

51:30.600 --> 51:35.750
all the lessons I'd learned, so that
it would not suffer any more losses.

51:35.800 --> 51:38.540
But it was vanity, pure and simple.

51:41.120 --> 51:43.390
And now I've failed again.

51:45.960 --> 51:49.080
Failure is too strong a word, Sister.

51:51.600 --> 51:53.510
Misjudgement, perhaps...

51:53.560 --> 51:55.560
from which we learn.

51:59.600 --> 52:02.400
Will you pray with me for the child?

52:16.720 --> 52:18.430
Excuse me?

52:18.480 --> 52:21.750
Did you find the gas leak?
Was it the water heater?

52:21.800 --> 52:25.400
Wasn't a leak, love. Fitted
without a proper flue.

52:26.320 --> 52:29.190
'Bout time they pulled this lot down.

52:35.880 --> 52:37.910
I don't trust my eyes any more.

52:37.960 --> 52:39.870
You think you see a flicker and then...

52:39.920 --> 52:41.590
I know, love.

52:42.360 --> 52:46.160
She fighting on the
inside. She want to live.

52:52.480 --> 52:54.190
She's coming to kick us out.

52:54.240 --> 52:57.070
I don't want to leave her
again, Cyril. What if she...?

52:57.120 --> 52:59.460
- She move!
- She's awake?

53:01.720 --> 53:05.720
- I don't think so, Ma.
- She move. I see it.

53:23.040 --> 53:26.040
Baby Lin Chen is responding to stimulus.

53:26.480 --> 53:29.040
Our prayers were answered.

53:31.040 --> 53:33.380
Thank you, Sister Julienne.

53:36.440 --> 53:39.030
I shall return to the Mother House.

53:39.080 --> 53:41.150
You won't reconsider?

53:42.000 --> 53:44.870
This is your mission, Sister Julienne.

53:45.760 --> 53:48.300
I should never have usurped it.

54:05.120 --> 54:07.600
Sister? Sister?

54:13.400 --> 54:16.880
There is a vanity in excess penance.

54:19.440 --> 54:23.440
You must have sustenance.

54:25.920 --> 54:28.390
Thank you, Sister Monica Joan.

54:30.600 --> 54:32.070
Thank you.

54:50.880 --> 54:53.310
Your carriage to the station, Sister.

54:53.360 --> 54:55.830
And I will brook no argument.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.870
You are very kind.

55:37.320 --> 55:38.720
Come in.

55:39.840 --> 55:42.350
- Oh. - It's all looking
very nice, Sister.

55:42.400 --> 55:47.030
Thank you. It has been
an interesting few months.

55:47.080 --> 55:48.680
Do sit down.

55:50.960 --> 55:54.630
I wondered if you'd been given any
news about Sister Mary Cynthia.

55:54.680 --> 55:56.310
Not yet, I'm afraid.

55:56.360 --> 56:00.070
But I do know that she is safe and
being cared for at the Mother House.

56:00.120 --> 56:03.710
I stayed at the Mother House
the night that my ship docked.

56:03.760 --> 56:06.310
I'd hoped I might see her but I didn't.

56:06.360 --> 56:09.150
No-one would tell me anything about her.

56:09.200 --> 56:12.300
Sister Julienne, I don't
think she's there.

56:15.320 --> 56:17.590
'Sometimes there is no map

56:17.640 --> 56:20.550
'for the road we find ourselves upon.

56:20.600 --> 56:25.000
'It lies ahead, uncharted,
unfurling into mist.

56:26.760 --> 56:30.670
'We are all travelling through
one another's countries.

56:30.720 --> 56:33.790
'But it is no matter
if we meet as strangers,

56:33.840 --> 56:37.360
'for we can join forces and learn to love.

56:38.800 --> 56:42.550
'And where there is
friendship and affection

56:42.600 --> 56:45.840
'there is the place we can all call home.'

56:48.640 --> 56:52.670
We've received permission and
funds to engage a new midwife.

56:52.720 --> 56:55.630
I don't want the kind of help
you and Eugene are offering.

56:55.680 --> 56:58.230
Do you hear me? I don't want it.

56:58.280 --> 57:02.630
Spectacular Chariot Race --
prams, carts, wheelbarrows.

57:02.680 --> 57:08.950
Nursing treats young working class
girls the way the world treats women.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.230
Tell me, honestly. Did
I do the right thing?

57:11.280 --> 57:12.830
You did the only thing you could.

57:12.880 --> 57:14.990
We were happy enough before.

57:15.040 --> 57:18.480
And we will be happy
again, whatever happens.
