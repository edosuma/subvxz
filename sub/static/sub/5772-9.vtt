WEBVTT

00:02.636 --> 00:04.672
(Mindy)
DANNY, MY BELOVED SEX PARTNER,
GET IN HERE.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.607
WELCOME TO YOUR EROTIC BATH.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.609
I DON'T KNOW.
BATHS?

00:08.642 --> 00:10.578
ISN'T THAT LIKE MARINATING
IN YOUR OWN FILTH?

00:10.611 --> 00:11.512
DANNY, COME ON.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.181
COSMO SAYS THAT TAKING
A BATH TOGETHER

00:13.214 --> 00:15.516
IS THE #9 WAY
TO HAVE A HORNY AUTUMN.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.285
DON'T YOU WANT TO HAVE
A HORNY AUTUMN?

00:17.318 --> 00:18.552
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T THINK IT'S FOR ME.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.254
I'M GOOD.
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:20.288 --> 00:21.755
WHY WOULD YOU WANNA
TAKE A BATH?

00:21.789 --> 00:25.059
ONLY LOSERS TAKE BATHS
LIKE SCARFACE.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.394
I'M IN.

00:26.427 --> 00:30.131
[sighs] SCARFACE NEVER SAT
ON MICHELLE PFEIFFER'S LAP.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.433
HE SHOULD'VE.
MAYBE IN SCARFACE 2 THEY WILL.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.268
I FEEL LIKE I'M
IN A BABY BJORN.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.204
I'M LIKE A KANGAROO
AND YOU'RE IN MY POUCH.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.738
OW! YOUR KNEE'S
IN MY BUTT CHEEKS!

00:37.771 --> 00:39.373
WELL, YOU JUST ELBOWED ME
IN THE BREAST!

00:39.407 --> 00:40.374
OW!

00:40.408 --> 00:41.709
THIS IS NICE.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.477
WHAT? THIS SUCKS.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.246
I COULD TAKE A BATH
WITH BEVERLY LIKE THIS.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.247
THIS IS KIND OF NICE.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.381
IT'S NICE, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

00:47.415 --> 00:50.418
I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD TAKE
A BATH TOGETHER.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.155
(Annette)
DANIEL, ARE YOU IN HERE?

00:54.188 --> 00:56.157
THAT'S MA.
SHE CAN'T SEE US LIKE THIS.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.391
PRETEND I'M IN THE BATH

00:57.425 --> 00:58.826
AND YOU'RE ON THE TOILET
WATCHING.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.361
WHAT?
THAT'S SO MUCH WORSE!

01:00.394 --> 01:01.362
(Annette)
I'M COMING IN!

01:01.395 --> 01:03.397
DUCK!
[inhales]

01:04.665 --> 01:06.100
YOU'RE TAKING A BATH?

01:06.134 --> 01:08.302
ISN'T THAT JUST MARINATING
IN YOUR OWN FILTH?

01:08.336 --> 01:10.171
IT'S SEXY AND COOL.
WELL,

01:10.204 --> 01:12.373
ELLEN HAD ON THESE
TWO LITTLE BRITISH GIRLS,

01:12.406 --> 01:13.374
YOU KNOW, THOSE GIRLS?

01:13.407 --> 01:14.708
AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN
THAT GOOD!

01:14.742 --> 01:17.211
I MEAN, ONE OF THEM
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.312
I SHOULD'VE HAD YOU
AND RICHIE ON

01:18.346 --> 01:19.647
WHEN YOU WERE THAT AGE.
AH!

01:19.680 --> 01:21.882
OKAY, MA, I'M GONNA NEED
A LITTLE PRIVACY RIGHT NOW.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.185
I GOTTA CLEAN
MY BATHING SUIT AREA.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.653
ALL RIGHT.
BUT REMEMBER:

01:25.686 --> 01:29.089
THE BATHROOM DOOR
CAN'T BLOCK GOD'S EYES.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.660
GOOD-BYE, MA!

01:32.693 --> 01:35.363
[gasping]

01:35.396 --> 01:37.365
I'M SORRY!
I'M SO SORRY!

01:37.398 --> 01:38.399
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

01:38.432 --> 01:39.600
LET ME SAY SOMETHING.
I AM REALLY IMPRESSED AT HOW

01:39.633 --> 01:42.336
LONG YOU CAN HOLD YOUR BREATH.
YOU'RE LIKE A NAVY SEAL, BABE.

01:42.370 --> 01:46.674
(Annette)
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, DANNY.
ENJOY YOUR BATH, MINDY.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.309
YOU BLEW IT!

01:48.342 --> 01:51.312
[upbeat music]

01:51.345 --> 01:53.347
*

01:53.381 --> 01:54.748
DANNY, I STILL HAVE BUBBLE BATH
UP MY NOSE.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.184
THAT WAS THE WORST.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.851
YOUR MOTHER HAS TO LEARN
SOME BOUNDARIES.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.387
I SENT YOU A DIRTY TEXT
THE OTHER DAY.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.154
YOU KNOW WHAT I GOT BACK?

02:00.188 --> 02:01.655
"YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.823
THIS IS ANNETTE."

02:02.856 --> 02:04.325
SOMETIMES MA GOES
THROUGH MY PHONE.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.859
YOU'VE GOTTA STOP SENDING ME
ALL THOSE NUDIES.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.661
OH, I WILL NEVER STOP
SENDING NUDIES.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.297
THAT'S MY FIRST AMENDMENT
RIGHT.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.698
DANNY, I FEEL LIKE
SINCE WE'VE STARTED DATING,

02:10.731 --> 02:12.400
YOUR MOM'S BEEN AROUND
A LOT MORE.

02:12.433 --> 02:15.403
LOOK, WHENEVER I'M IN A SERIOUS
RELATIONSHIP, YOU KNOW,

02:15.436 --> 02:17.471
SHE GETS TERRITORIAL.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.407
LOOK, SHE STILL WANTS TO KNOW
THAT SHE'S MY NUMBER ONE GIRL,

02:19.440 --> 02:20.408
THAT'S IT.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.376
SHE'S YOUR NUMBER ONE GIRL?

02:22.410 --> 02:24.478
IF A TRAIN WAS COMING AND YOU
COULD ONLY SAVE ONE PERSON--

02:24.512 --> 02:25.679
MA. YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN PLAYING

02:25.713 --> 02:27.448
ON THE TRACKS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.449
LOOK, HERE'S THE THING.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.751
MY MA AND I,
WE DON'T HAVE A NORMAL

02:30.784 --> 02:32.253
MOTHER-SON RELATIONSHIP.

02:32.286 --> 02:35.356
I MEAN, SINCE MY DAD LEFT,

02:35.389 --> 02:36.757
I'VE BEEN THE ONLY MAN
IN HER LIFE.

02:36.790 --> 02:39.660
THAT IS VERY SAD.
AND SWEET.

02:39.693 --> 02:40.661
OKAY.
I GET IT.

02:40.694 --> 02:43.597
OKAY.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.906
"REMEMBER, YOU'RE NOT MARRIED.
IT'S A SIN.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.843
LOVE, ANNETTE."

02:55.876 --> 02:56.810
(Jeremy)
HELLO, DR. LEDREAU,

02:56.844 --> 02:59.613
HOW I LOVE THESE LONG,
COMPREHENSIVE CHATS.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.316
NOW THE TRICK WITH APHIDS IS,
YOU HAVE TO--

03:02.350 --> 03:03.451
CATCH THEM BEFORE THEY HATCH.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.487
YES, YOU DID MENTION THAT,
AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.521
OH, MINDY, HELLO.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.822
COME ON IN.
TAKE A LOAD OFF.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.525
JUST GIVING DR. REED
HERE SOME GARDENING TIPS.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.761
COOL!
WAIT, JEREMY,

03:13.794 --> 03:16.364
YOU SAID BEING OUTDOORS
WAS FOR, "PEASANTS."

03:16.397 --> 03:17.731
WHAT? NO!

03:17.765 --> 03:19.467
SHE MUST'VE MISHEARD MY THICK
FOREIGN ACCENT.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.571
WELL, I HAVE A DELIVERY,
BUT TO BE CONTINUED.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.340
YES. FAIR THEE WELL,
DR. LEDREAU.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.575
FAIR THEE WELL.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.245
WHY ARE YOU BEING SUCH A KISS-UP
TO DR. LEDREAU?

03:31.279 --> 03:32.112
HE'S SO BORING.

03:32.145 --> 03:35.015
BUT HE IS ABOUT TO RETIRE.
WHICH MEANS--

03:35.048 --> 03:36.484
HIS PARKING SPOT IS FREE?
I DON'T HAVE A CAR,

03:36.517 --> 03:37.718
BUT I DON'T WANT
ANYONE ELSE TO HAVE IT.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.388
NO, NO, NO. DR. LEDREAU IS GONNA
HAVE TO REFER ALL HIS PATIENTS

03:40.421 --> 03:41.455
TO A NEW PRACTICE.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.291
SO I HAVE BEEN
BUTTERING HIM UP

03:43.324 --> 03:46.460
TO GET MY HANDS ON THAT SWEET
PATIENT LIST OF HIS.

03:46.494 --> 03:47.295
DON'T DO THAT, JEREMY.
IT'S DORKY.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.429
OH, SORRY.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.830
I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL I GET
MY GREASY MITTS

03:49.863 --> 03:52.266
ON THAT PARKING SPOT.
VOILA!

03:52.300 --> 03:53.467
HOW IS THAT NOT DORKY?

03:53.501 --> 03:55.269
I LOOK COOL.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.439
EVERYONE, I HAVE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.342
I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T LIKE
WHEN I DRAG MY PERSONAL ISSUES

04:01.375 --> 04:02.410
INTO THE OFFICE--

04:02.443 --> 04:03.677
THAT'S ALL YOU EVER DO.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.646
IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.882
BUT YOU ALL DESERVE
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.584
TAMRA?

04:10.618 --> 04:13.654
I DUMPED MORGAN
LAST NIGHT.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.057
HOW COME NO ONE'S GASPING?

04:17.090 --> 04:18.692
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

04:18.726 --> 04:20.361
DID YOU SEE THE TWO
OF YOU IN A MIRROR TOGETHER?

04:20.394 --> 04:22.496
WAIT, WAIT, WHAT?
NO, WHAT?

04:22.530 --> 04:24.498
NO, I JUST FELT LIKE
WE WERE BETTER OFF AS FRIENDS

04:24.532 --> 04:26.467
WHO DON'T HANG OUT OR TALK.
YEAH.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.337
(Morgan)
WHY DO YOU KEEP NODDING?
THIS IS A TERRIBLE THING.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.638
MORGAN!
YES.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.840
WHY IS YOUR DESK
AND ALL YOUR STUFF IN MY OFFICE?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.074
OBVIOUSLY, I'M TOO HEARTBROKEN
TO WORK IN PHLEBOTOMY

04:34.107 --> 04:35.543
WITH TAMRA.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.845
SO YOU AND I WILL BE
OFFICE MATES UNLESS--

04:37.878 --> 04:39.012
DR. L ,
YOU WANNA TAKE ME IN?

04:39.046 --> 04:40.381
NO.
DR. C? MY MAN?

04:40.414 --> 04:41.682
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
DR. L?

04:41.715 --> 04:42.850
MAYBE DANNY DOES?

04:42.883 --> 04:44.017
DR. C?
NOPE.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.686
IT'S ALL ME AND YOU, BUDDY.

04:45.719 --> 04:46.920
NO I--
IT'S FINE. LOOK,

04:46.954 --> 04:48.121
WE'LL MAKE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS.
WE CAN...

04:48.155 --> 04:51.325
THE SIGN, WE'LL JUST ADD--
LIKE, I HAVE A BUMPER STICKER

04:51.359 --> 04:52.693
THAT SAYS "OREGON".

04:52.726 --> 04:54.094
AND WE CAN USE A SHARPIE
AND MAKE IT "MORGAN".

04:54.127 --> 04:55.195
NO!
NO "MOREGON."

04:55.228 --> 04:57.398
OKAY, CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT
THIS IN OUR OFFICE?

04:57.431 --> 04:59.533
STOP SAYING "OUR OFFICE."

04:59.567 --> 05:00.668
[glass shattering]

05:00.701 --> 05:02.470
YOU JUST SPILLED
ALL THE BLOOD SAMPLES!

05:02.503 --> 05:04.004
[glass shattering]
(Peter)
SON OF A BITCH!

05:13.447 --> 05:14.615
HEY, PETER.
HMM?

05:14.648 --> 05:17.117
DID YOU EVER DATE A GIRL AND HER
MOM'S ALWAYS HANGING AROUND?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.687
OH, YEAH,
IT WAS SUPER AWKWARD.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.623
AND IN YOUR SITUATION, ARE YOU
ALSO SECRETLY DATING THE MOM?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.425
OH, MY GOD.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.093
AND DANNY WON'T
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT

05:26.126 --> 05:29.797
BECAUSE HE'S THIS CREEPY,
NORMAN BATES-STYLE SON-HUSBAND.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.131
SO WHY DON'T YOU GET HER
A REAL HUSBAND?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.500
IF FINDING A HUSBAND
WAS THAT EASY,

05:32.533 --> 05:33.867
I WOULD NOT BE HERE WORKING.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.537
I'D BE MARRIED
AND IN CONNECTICUT.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.873
WINE-DRUNK ALL DAY,
AND WORKING ON MY SMUG MOM-BLOG

05:39.907 --> 05:41.909
CALLED
"DIAPERS AND DAYDREAMS."

05:41.942 --> 05:43.511
WELL,
YOU COULD GET HER A DATE.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.379
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE TO TAKE HER
OFF YOUR HANDS.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.847
THAT'S WHAT MY FRIENDS
ALWAYS DO WITH ME.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.049
BUT IT NEVER WORKS BECAUSE
THE WOMEN THEY SET ME UP WITH

05:49.082 --> 05:50.083
ALWAYS HATE ME.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.119
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, BUT I DON'T
HAVE ANY FRIENDS

05:52.152 --> 05:54.488
TO SET HER UP WITH.
DAMN IT!

05:54.522 --> 05:56.724
WHY IS MY POSSE
SO YOUNG AND FRESH?

05:58.759 --> 06:02.029
AND RIGHT AFTER THAT ROBIN
LEFT MY BIRDBATH,

06:02.062 --> 06:03.964
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHO SHOWED UP.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.166
[mumbles]
NO.
MY FRIEND BILL.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.968
HE'S ALSO A ROBIN.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.404
I SAID, "COME ON IN, BILL,
THE WATER'S FINE."

06:10.438 --> 06:11.839
OH, LOOK!
ANOTHER PERSON IS HERE!

06:11.872 --> 06:13.441
HELLO, DR. REED.
HI.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.908
DR. LEDREAU.
MM.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.009
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.045
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET
SET UP ON A DATE

06:18.078 --> 06:20.013
WITH DR. CASTELLANO'S MOTHER?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.014
[gasps]

06:21.048 --> 06:23.116
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LOVELY.

06:23.150 --> 06:27.455
BOY, EVERYONE IN YOUR PRACTICE
IS SO DARN NICE.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.321
JUST ME.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.023
(Annette)
I'M JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.093
I HAVEN'T BEEN ON A DATE
SINCE 1974.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.729
HAS A LOT CHANGED?
DO PEOPLE STILL DO COCAINE?

06:35.763 --> 06:37.097
HERE'S SOME TIPS.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.666
DO NOT BRING UP
YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND

06:38.699 --> 06:41.134
AND START TO CRY.
SOUNDS EASY, BUT IT HAPPENS.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.636
ALSO, IF HE MAKES A JOKE,
GO--

06:42.670 --> 06:44.572
[flirty laugh]
"YOU'RE BAD."

06:44.605 --> 06:46.006
THAT SOUNDS SLUTTY TO ME.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.208
I KNOW, EXACTLY.
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

06:48.241 --> 06:51.111
WEAR AN OUTFIT
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL BEAUTIFUL.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.846
YOU DON'T LIKE
WHAT I GOT ON?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.214
DOT PICKED IT!

06:54.247 --> 06:56.116
A IT'S A NEW ENGLAND
AQUARIUM SWEATSHIRT

06:56.149 --> 06:57.685
AND TAN PANTS.
NO.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.119
IT'S NICE.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.588
IT SHOWS SHE TRAVELS.

07:00.621 --> 07:03.056
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
IN MY CLOSET.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.725
YOU'RE A LOT SMALLER THAN ME,
BUT THIS ONE TIME,

07:04.758 --> 07:07.928
I HAD A STOMACH PARASITE
AND GOT REAL SKINNY.

07:11.499 --> 07:14.167
EAT YOUR HEART OUT,
SOFIA VERGARA.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.236
I FEEL SO BEAUTIFUL.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.205
I THINK A DATE IS EXACTLY
WHAT I NEEDED.

07:18.238 --> 07:21.074
WHAT DID DANNY SAY
WHEN YOU TOLD HIM?

07:21.108 --> 07:22.910
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

07:22.943 --> 07:27.180
WHY'S MA DRESSED UP LIKE
THE TART OF STATEN ISLAND?

07:27.214 --> 07:29.149
I DIDN'T EXACTLY TELL HIM.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.451
I SAID IT WAS SLUTTY.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.023
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!

07:36.056 --> 07:37.825
YOUR POOR, SWEET MOTHER
SEEMED LONELY.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.993
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD SET HER UP
ON A DATE WITH DR. LEDREAU.

07:40.027 --> 07:40.994
WHAT? NO!

07:41.028 --> 07:43.897
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
MA. MA, I DO NOT LIKE THIS.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.232
WHY NOT?
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

07:45.265 --> 07:46.867
YEAH, YOU'RE ACTING
AS MAD AS THAT TIME

07:46.900 --> 07:48.769
I USED YOUR SHOEHORN TO GET
MY PHONE OUT OF THE TOILET

07:48.802 --> 07:50.971
I HAD NO WAY OF GETTING
MY SHOES ON THAT DAY!

07:51.004 --> 07:52.139
I HAD TO WALK AROUND
WITH FLIP-FLOPS.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.874
STOP PIMPING OUT MY MA.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.208
SHE'S NOTHING BUT CLEAVAGE
RIGHT NOW.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.944
DANNY! THIS IS NOTHING COMPARED
TO THAT V-NECK

07:56.977 --> 07:58.946
THAT GAY GUY FROM THE MALL
TRICKED YOU INTO BUYING.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.215
OH, AND I GET HIT ON NON-STOP
WHEN I WEAR THAT THING.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.917
AND I DON'T WANT THAT FOR MA.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.218
WOULD YOU JUST RELAX?
IT'S ONE DATE,

08:05.252 --> 08:06.286
AND I'M GOING!

08:06.319 --> 08:07.721
YOUR DATE!

08:07.755 --> 08:08.989
HE'S HERE.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.891
AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS SEX
ON HIS MIND.

08:10.924 --> 08:11.892
[excited squeal]

08:11.925 --> 08:13.661
THAT'S NOT HELPFUL.
BYE.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.029
IF HE HAS A HEART ATTACK,

08:16.063 --> 08:17.665
IT'S BECAUSE HE TOOK ONE
OF THOSE SEX PILLS.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.199
JUST LEAVE HIM, MA.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.035
DANNY, I JUST WANT YOUR MOM
TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND

08:22.069 --> 08:24.204
SO VALENTINE'S DAY ISN'T
YOU, ME, AND MA

08:24.237 --> 08:25.873
KISSING AT THE TOP
OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

08:25.906 --> 08:26.807
THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN

08:26.840 --> 08:28.676
BECAUSE MA AND I LIKE TO GET
CHINESE FOOD,

08:28.709 --> 08:30.177
AND THEN WE WATCH
GOOFY MOVIES.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.812
YOU KNOW WHAT, DANNY?

08:31.845 --> 08:33.681
I THINK THAT YOU
ARE PART OF THIS PROBLEM.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.782
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:34.815 --> 08:36.083
YEAH, YOUR MOM IS OVERBEARING

08:36.116 --> 08:37.785
AND SHE'S CLINGY,
AND SHE CONSTANTLY LEAVES

08:37.818 --> 08:39.252
WEIGHT LOSS PAMPHLETS
IN MY PURSE.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.889
BUT SHE ONLY DOES THOSE THINGS
BECAUSE YOU LET HER.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.957
I THINK YOU LIKE HER BEING
AROUND ALL THE TIME.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.894
NO, I DON'T!
SHE'S NOT MY BEST FRIEND.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.929
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T KNOW
WHO THIS LEDREAU GUY IS.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.231
HE COULD BE A KILLER.
THEY NEVER CAUGHT ZODIAC.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.034
OKAY, DR. LEDREAU IS A SWEET,
NICE MAN.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.603
IF ANYTHING, I'M AFRAID
HE'S NOT GONNA LIKE HER.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.837
WHAT?
WHY WOULDN'T HE LIKE HER?

08:56.870 --> 08:57.871
MA'S A PERFECT TEN.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.139
KATE UPTON IS A PERFECT TEN.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.608
WHO'S THIS KATE UP-TOWN?

09:02.142 --> 09:04.044
(Mindy)
OOH, A MESSAGE FROM ANNETTE.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.914
(Annette)
OH, GOD, HELP ME!
PLEASE, HELP!

09:06.947 --> 09:08.816
OH, NO! HE WAS A MURDERER!

09:08.849 --> 09:09.950
(Annette)
SORRY, MINDY, I'M
IN THE GARDEN CENTER.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.919
SOME OF THESE GUYS
NO SPEAK-A THE INGLES.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.755
ANYWAYS, HAD A GREAT DATE
LAST NIGHT.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.824
IF YOU SEE DANNY, TELL HIM
I MIGHT NOT DO SUNDAY DINNER

09:16.857 --> 09:18.225
BECAUSE I'M GOING ON
ANOTHER DATE.

09:18.258 --> 09:21.028
YES!
ALSO, ELLEN HAD THIS

09:21.061 --> 09:22.295
DIETICIAN ON THE SHOW--
NO. NO.

09:24.231 --> 09:28.035
[Morgan groaning sadly]

09:28.068 --> 09:29.737
[sighs]

09:29.770 --> 09:30.804
[groaning louder]

09:30.838 --> 09:32.806
OH, MY GOD! DUDE, HOW LONG
ARE YOU GONNA BE HERE?

09:32.840 --> 09:35.676
WELL, NORMALLY THE AMOUNT
OF MONTHS I DATE SOMEONE,

09:35.709 --> 09:37.310
THAT'S HOW MANY YEARS IT TAKES
ME TO GET OVER THEM.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.614
SO...SEVEN YEARS.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.683
I THINK THAT I WOULD LIKE
TO HELP YOU

09:42.716 --> 09:44.618
CREATE
AN ONLINE DATING PROFILE.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.019
WHAT DO YOU SAY, HUH?

09:46.053 --> 09:48.822
SO THAT YOU CAN MEET THE WOMAN
OF YOUR DREAMS.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.724
YEAH, I ALREADY MET
MARKIE POST ONE TIME.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.793
AND HER PUBLICIST SAID
STOP SENDING HER EMAILS.

09:52.826 --> 09:56.229
COME HERE. THE TRICK
TO ONLINE DATING IS...

09:56.263 --> 09:57.965
YOU WANNA BOLD-FACED LIE.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.900
SO FOR EXAMPLE,
"WHAT ARE YOUR INTERESTS?"

09:59.933 --> 10:03.003
DOG HUSBANDRY AND SPENDING TIME
WITH GRANDMOTHER.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.238
I WILL SAY SURFING.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.040
NOW, "PROFESSIONAL INCOME"?

10:07.074 --> 10:08.141
IMPOVERISHED.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.710
I HEARD, "RATHER NOT SAY."
YEAH.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.012
NOW, WE NEED
TO UPLOAD A PHOTO.

10:12.045 --> 10:15.415
OH, MY GOD! I GOT ONE OF ME
COLLECTING BONES AT THE DUMP.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.549
IT'S GREAT.
I LOOK REALLY GOOD.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.152
THE TRICK TO ONLINE DATING
IS FINDING A PHOTO OF YOU

10:19.186 --> 10:21.955
SURROUNDED BY TWO UGGOS
SO YOU LOOK HOT BY COMPARISON.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.724
YUP.
I'M GONNA GO GET DR. REED

10:23.757 --> 10:26.059
AND DR. CASTELLANO.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.361
JUST GET DR. REED.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.967
PAGING DR. LEDREAU.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.003
PLEASE REPORT TO MINDY!

10:36.036 --> 10:37.971
JUST KIDDING.
DR. LEDREAU,

10:38.005 --> 10:40.207
I HEARD THAT YOU HAD
A GREAT DATE WITH ANNETTE.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.341
WELL, I THOUGHT WE DID,

10:41.374 --> 10:42.943
BUT SHE'S NOT
RETURNING MY CALLS.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.678
WAIT, WHAT?

10:44.712 --> 10:46.680
SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE HAD
ANOTHER DATE ON SUNDAY.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.015
HEY, DR. LEDREAU,

10:48.048 --> 10:50.150
FANCY JOINING ME
FOR A SPOT OF BREAKFAST?

10:50.183 --> 10:51.952
YOU CAN TELL ME FACTS
ABOUT TOAST.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.421
I'M NOT REALLY IN THE MOOD.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.225
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?

10:58.258 --> 11:00.961
NOTHING, I WAS JUST MY NORMAL,
CHARMING SELF.

11:00.994 --> 11:01.929
DR. LEDREAU, WAIT!

11:01.962 --> 11:03.030
HOW IS YOUR GRANDSON
DOING WITH THE TRUMPET?

11:03.063 --> 11:05.766
(Morgan)
DR. L, YOU GOTTA COME HERE
AND SEE THIS.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.434
MORGAN, I DON'T WANT TO SEE
YOUR ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE.

11:07.467 --> 11:08.268
IT'S LIKE 80 YEARS
TOO LATE.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.837
YEAH, BUT I DID MINE
WITH HOT WATER.

11:09.870 --> 11:10.904
IT DOESN'T MATTER--
NO, BUT COME HERE,

11:10.938 --> 11:12.139
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK!
THIS IS MY ONLINE DATING PROFILE

11:12.172 --> 11:13.741
THE MATCHES CAME BACK IN.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.242
[imitating computer voice]
YOUR FIRST MATCH IS SARAH.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.710
YES!
I LOVE YOU. I'M IN.

11:16.744 --> 11:17.711
DUDE, YOU GOTTA SEE THEM ALL.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.079
I FEEL LIKE SHE'S THE ONE.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.881
YOUR NEXT MATCH
IS ANNETTE.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.115
OH, MY GOD!

11:22.149 --> 11:23.951
SEEMS A LITTLE O-L-D.

11:23.984 --> 11:28.055
NOW, SHE PICKED AN EXCELLENT
CHOICE OF UGGOS.

11:28.088 --> 11:31.091
OH, NO! I'VE TURNED HER
INTO THE TART OF STATEN ISLAND!

11:33.260 --> 11:35.796
MINDY, DOT AND I
ARE WATCHING QVC.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.131
NOW, THE SAFARI VIXEN
COLLECTION.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.499
CAN WHITE WOMEN
WEAR THAT TOO?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.468
HEY, WHY ARE YOU DOING
ONLINE DATING?

11:41.501 --> 11:43.170
I THOUGHT YOU HAD A GOOD DATE
WITH DR. LEDREAU.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.238
OH, I DID.
I LOVE DATING!

11:45.272 --> 11:47.374
BUT I FIGURED,
IF I HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME

11:47.407 --> 11:50.744
WITH THAT FUDDY-DUDDY, I WANNA
SEE WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.846
HEY, THERE IS NOTHING ELSE
OUT THERE.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.182
TAKE IT FROM ME, NEW YORK CITY
IS JUST ALL HOT GAYS

11:55.215 --> 11:56.183
AND BALD STRAIGHTS.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.450
SAYS YOU.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.452
I'VE ALREADY BEEN TWIXTING
ONLINE

11:59.486 --> 12:00.888
WITH A COUPLE OF COOL GUYS.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.023
A PLUMBER FROM THE BRONX,

12:03.056 --> 12:05.759
AND A BLUE-EYED BLACK FELLOW
WHO'S A MODEL!

12:05.793 --> 12:07.961
BLUE-EYED BLACK GUYS
ARE NOT REAL.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.529
THEY'RE ALWAYS
A CATFISH.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.530
OH, MY GOD.
DANNY'S GONNA KILL ME.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.431
RELAX!

12:11.464 --> 12:13.466
SHE'S JUST HAVING
A SEXUAL AWAKENING.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.468
LIKE WHEN STELLA GOT
HER GROOVE BACK.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.404
THAT DOESN'T EXIST!
YOU GO TO THE CRIB

12:17.437 --> 12:18.839
AND YOU GET
NATALEE HOLLOWAY-ED!

12:18.872 --> 12:20.040
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT,
ANNETTE?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.775
THESE ONLINE GUYS?
THEY'RE ALL MURDERERS

12:21.809 --> 12:23.844
OR WEIRDOS--

12:27.080 --> 12:28.081
HEY!
HEY!

12:28.115 --> 12:31.551
WELCOME TO
PORGAN'S OFFICE!

12:31.584 --> 12:32.552
PETER AND MORGAN--

12:32.585 --> 12:33.620
OH!
VERY COOL.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.522
HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU THE STORY
ABOUT THESE GLASSES?

12:35.555 --> 12:36.990
YEAH!
GOT THEM AT THE--

12:37.024 --> 12:38.091
SALVATION ARMY.
SALVATION ARMY.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.526
THEY WERE THROWING--
GONNA THROW 'EM OUT.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.494
AND I SWOOPED IN AND SAID
"NOT ON MY WATCH."

12:41.528 --> 12:43.563
HEY, I NEED A FAVOR.
ANYTHING.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.899
WILL YOU TAKE DANNY'S
MOM OUT ON A DATE?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.467
REALLY?
YOU TAKE HER OUT

12:47.500 --> 12:49.102
ON A HORRIBLE DATE,
AND THEN SHE REALIZES

12:49.136 --> 12:50.503
THAT DR. LEDREAU
ISN'T THAT BAD.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.472
OH, YOU WANT ME TO
THROW THE DATE.

12:52.505 --> 12:53.473
NO, NO, NO--
WOMEN--

12:53.506 --> 12:55.508
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE YOURSELF.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.509
WOW.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.445
FIRST YOU TELL TAMRA
SHE CAN DO BETTER THAN ME,

12:58.478 --> 12:59.446
AND NOW THIS?

12:59.479 --> 13:01.181
YOU KNOW WHAT,
FORGET IT.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.249
BUT TO HAVE YOU--
GIVE YOU 200 BUCKS.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.917
[gasps]

13:03.951 --> 13:05.819
SHE CAN PICK ME UP
AT 8:00.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.821
(Danny)
HEY, SWEETHEART.

13:07.855 --> 13:09.189
OH, HEY, BABE.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.291
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.426
THEY'RE SO BEAUTIFUL!

13:13.460 --> 13:15.162
WAIT, DID YOU CHEAT
ON ME?

13:15.195 --> 13:16.429
WHAT?
I'LL KILL YOU.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.098
OW!
I'LL PLOW THROUGH
ALL YOUR FRIENDS!

13:18.131 --> 13:20.400
MINDY, RELAX!
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.534
I WANTED TO THANK YOU.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:21.568 --> 13:25.105
I DO NEED TO...

13:25.138 --> 13:27.174
LET MA GO A LITTLE.
I'M SORRY.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.009
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE, DANNY.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.410
I DIDN'T APOLOGIZE
WHEN I RAN OUT OF PLATES

13:30.443 --> 13:32.145
AND USED YOUR RECORDS
TO EAT OFF OF.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.180
OH, YEAH.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.281
WELL, THE GOOD
NEWS IS,

13:34.314 --> 13:36.216
I THINK SHE REALLY
LIKED DR. BORING.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.251
SHE'S GOT ANOTHER
DATE TONIGHT.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.619
AND YOU HAVE A DATE
TONIGHT,

13:39.652 --> 13:42.055
WITH DR. DAN, FOOT MASSEUSE
OF THE STARS.

13:42.089 --> 13:45.092
TELL YOUR ARCHES
IT'S JUDGMENT DAY.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.362
[line ringing]
(Annette)
HELLO?

13:49.396 --> 13:50.931
HEY, ANNETTE.
I'M JUST CALLING TO FIND OUT

13:50.964 --> 13:52.132
HOW YOUR DATE WENT
LAST NIGHT.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.266
MINDY, YOU WERE RIGHT.
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY

13:53.300 --> 13:54.401
THE FIELD ANYMORE.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.236
I'M TOO OLD TO BE MAKING IT
WITH RANDOS.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.071
OH, I AM SO HAPPY
TO HEAR THAT.

13:58.105 --> 14:00.173
I JUST WANT TO GO ON ANOTHER
DATE WITH MORGAN.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.408
WAIT, WHAT?

14:02.575 --> 14:03.676
BEVERLY?
WHERE'S MORGAN?

14:03.710 --> 14:06.579
HE'S OUT IN THE COURTYARD
PLAYING CATCH WITH DR. C.

14:06.613 --> 14:07.981
OH, GOD.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.083
YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD
WE DID THIS.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.985
USUALLY COME OUT
HERE TO SMOKE.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.187
THIS IS MUCH HEALTHIER.
GREAT IDEA, MORGAN.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.623
YOU KNOW, MY DAD LEFT
WHEN I WAS A KID, TOO, SO--

14:16.656 --> 14:18.025
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT CATCH WAS.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.659
TURNS OUT
IT'S JUST LIKE FETCH.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.129
BUT BOTH...PEOPLE
ARE THE...PERSON.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.163
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.464
GETTING SO BIG.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.233
I GOTTA LAY OFF
THE CREATINE?

14:26.266 --> 14:28.101
IT'S LIKE I'M WATCHING
YOU BECOME A MAN,

14:28.135 --> 14:31.071
BEFORE MY EYES.
I LOVE YA.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.973
MAYBE NEXT HALLOWEEN
WE CAN HANG OUT TOGETHER.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.241
YEAH, SURE.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.475
MAYBE I'LL BE BARNEY RUBBLE,
YOU BE BAM BAM.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.344
I'LL TAKE YOU TRICK OR
TREATING, THE WHOLE THING.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.379
YEAH, I DON'T REALLY
TRICK OR TREAT ANYMORE, THOUGH.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.581
MORGAN, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU, RIGHT NOW!

14:41.614 --> 14:43.250
LISTEN, I CAN'T DO
THIS ANYMORE.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.384
WE HAVE TO TELL HIM.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.585
NO, WE'RE NOT
TELLING HIM ANYTHING.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.921
BABE, YOU'RE--
SORRY. STOP, STOP, STOP.
STOP IT! STOP IT!

14:47.955 --> 14:49.289
WHAT'S GOING ON?
DANNY.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.958
YEAH?
I'M DATING YOUR MOM.

14:50.991 --> 14:51.959
YOU'RE WHAT?

14:51.992 --> 14:53.560
DO NOT FREAK OUT, DANNY!
DO NOT FREAK OUT, DANNY.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.328
WHAT?!
YOU SHUT UP.
SHUT UP.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.263
WHAT DID YOU JUST
SAY TO ME?

14:56.296 --> 14:57.564
DANNY, DO NOT FREAK OUT,
I JUST SET THEM UP

14:57.597 --> 14:59.032
TO TEACH YOUR MOTHER
A LESSON

14:59.066 --> 15:00.267
SO THAT SHE WOULDN'T
WANT TO PLAY THE FIELD.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.568
OKAY, THIS IS ALL
YOUR FAULT, OKAY?

15:01.601 --> 15:03.971
YOU PUT THOSE FLOOZY
IDEAS INTO MA'S HEAD!

15:04.004 --> 15:05.038
THIS IS WHAT MORGAN'S
GONNA DO.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.406
HE'S GONNA CALL ANNETTE,
RIGHT NOW,

15:06.439 --> 15:08.208
AND HE'S GONNA END THINGS
WITH HER.
NO!

15:08.241 --> 15:09.943
YES!
NO, YOU GUYS THINK

15:09.977 --> 15:11.578
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR TAMRA,

15:11.611 --> 15:13.180
AND I'M NOT GOOD
ENOUGH FOR YOUR MOM.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.581
WELL, YOU KNOW WHO LIKES
ME THE WAY I AM?

15:14.614 --> 15:16.016
NETTIE.
"NETTIE"?

15:16.049 --> 15:17.650
I CAN'T BREAK UP
WITH HER.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.452
DANNY CANNOT HAVE ANOTHER
FATHER WALK OUT ON HIM.

15:19.486 --> 15:20.653
ANOTHER FATHER?
NO, NO, NO...

15:20.687 --> 15:23.523
[overlapping muttering]

15:23.556 --> 15:25.058
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.194
I FORGIVE YOU.
I FORGIVE YOU.

15:28.328 --> 15:31.131
OKAY, OKAY, THAT'S IT.
CALM DOWN.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.532
DANNY,
I'M SO SORRY!

15:32.565 --> 15:34.334
YOU KNOW, THIS IS ALL
YOUR FAULT, MINDY.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.969
STAY AWAY FROM MY MA!

15:36.003 --> 15:37.337
GOT A TEMPER
LIKE HIS DAD.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.471
SHUT UP.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.108
HEY, DR. P.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.375
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
MORGAN IS?

15:42.409 --> 15:43.576
TAMRA CASUALLY ASKED.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.145
HE'S ON A DATE.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.646
SOME OLDER CHICK
HE'S REALLY INTO.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.616
EW, WHY?
OLDER WOMEN ARE HORRIBLE.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.751
DIDN'T YOU SEE JACQUELINE
BISSET'S GOLDEN GLOBE SPEECH?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.486
WHY DO YOU CARE?
DIDN'T YOU BREAK UP WITH HIM?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.488
I KNOW, DR. P.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.524
I FEEL BELL JAR AS HELL
RIGHT NOW.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.159
I'M GONNA GO WIN
HIM BACK.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.461
YES!
YOU KNOW WHAT? YES.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.696
GO WIN HIM BACK,
AND WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT,

16:03.730 --> 16:05.565
I'LL MOVE HIS DESK
BACK INTO PHLEBOTOMY.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.500
COOL.
OKAY.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.336
[grunts]

16:09.369 --> 16:11.538
SON OF A BITCH
BOLTED IT TO THE FLOOR!

16:12.572 --> 16:15.242
(Annette)
HI! SORRY I'M LATE.

16:15.275 --> 16:18.545
A STORE WAS SELLING
DISCOUNTED FALL DECORATIONS.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.014
I'M TALKING GOURDS!

16:21.048 --> 16:22.549
IT'S WAY COOL--
WE'RE GONNA PUT THAT BACK
IN THE BAG

16:22.582 --> 16:24.017
RIGHT NOW,
THANK YOU.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.185
BUT YOU SAID WE
NEEDED COOL--

16:25.218 --> 16:26.553
OKAY, THE REASON
WE'RE HERE, MA--

16:26.586 --> 16:27.787
THIS IS AN
INTERVENTION.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.356
YOU CAN'T JUST BE
GOING OUT WITH

16:29.389 --> 16:30.357
ANY RANDO
YOU MEET ONLINE.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.358
YOU CAN'T DO THAT,
OKAY?

16:31.391 --> 16:32.525
(Morgan)
HEY!

16:32.559 --> 16:34.527
WHOO! I RAN HERE.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.629
ALL RIGHT!
OH!

16:36.663 --> 16:37.664
HI!
HI!

16:37.697 --> 16:39.399
WHAT THE HELL IS HE
DOING HERE?

16:39.432 --> 16:43.436
I INVITED HIM!
LIKE FUN DOUBLE DATE.

16:46.606 --> 16:47.740
THIS IS FUN,
YOU KNOW?

16:47.774 --> 16:50.377
IT'S SO HARD FOR
A FAMILY TO SIT DOWN,

16:50.410 --> 16:51.611
YOU KNOW,
FOR A MEAL THESE DAYS.

16:51.644 --> 16:52.679
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.215
AH, COOL IT.
EAT AN ICE CUBE.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.050
I HAVE NEVER SAID THIS
IN THE HISTORY OF MY LIFE,

16:57.084 --> 16:58.418
BUT I THINK THAT
WE SHOULD SKIP DINNER.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.520
MA, YOU'RE NOT GOING
OUT WITH HIM ANYMORE, OKAY?

17:00.553 --> 17:02.255
DANIEL, DON'T TALK
TO YOUR MOTHER THAT WAY.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.356
NO, THAT'S IT.
(Annette)
THANK YOU.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.357
ANNETTE LUIGA CASTELLANO,

17:04.391 --> 17:05.525
COME ON, GET UP.
NO.

17:05.558 --> 17:06.559
WE'RE GOING OUTSIDE,
WE'RE TALKING.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.760
YOU DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.362
GET OUTSIDE, WE'RE
GONNA TALK RIGHT NOW.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.498
FAMILY TALK.
NO. SIT YOUR ASS DOWN.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.799
I WAS--I WANTED TO SIT
DOWN ANYWAYS.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.067
WANT YOU TO SHUT UP,

17:14.101 --> 17:15.368
I WANT YOU TO
BUTTON UP YOUR SHIRT.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.470
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
GOING ON DATES?

17:17.504 --> 17:18.471
PLAYING THE FIELD?

17:18.505 --> 17:19.439
COME ON!
THIS ISN'T YOU.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.773
WELL, MAYBE
I WANT IT TO BE.

17:20.807 --> 17:21.841
MINDY SAYS THAT
THERE--

17:21.874 --> 17:23.510
MINDY'S A SEX
MANIAC, OKAY?

17:23.543 --> 17:24.711
IT'S NOT HER FAULT,
IT'S A CULTURAL THING.

17:24.744 --> 17:25.812
THE SPICES, THE COLORS.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.314
WHY DO YOU THINK
THOSE GODS

17:27.347 --> 17:28.381
HAVE SO MANY HANDS?

17:28.415 --> 17:30.183
BUT YOU--YOU'RE
A GOOD CATHOLIC.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.384
BEHAVE LIKE ONE.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.253
MAYBE TOO GOOD
A CATHOLIC.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.621
THE ONLY REASON
I DIDN'T DATE

17:34.654 --> 17:36.656
WHEN YOU AND RICHIE
WERE GROWING UP

17:36.689 --> 17:38.525
WAS BECAUSE I FELT
TOO GUILTY.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.826
WHAT?

17:39.859 --> 17:41.561
YOU WANTED TO DATE
THIS WHOLE TIME?

17:41.594 --> 17:43.130
IT'S NOT LIKE MEN
WEREN'T INTERESTED.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.531
WHY DO YOU THINK
FATHER FRANK

17:44.564 --> 17:46.299
WAS ALWAYS OVER
THE HOUSE?

17:46.333 --> 17:47.534
TO AID MY RELIGIOUS
EDUCATION

17:47.567 --> 17:48.801
AND DO CRAFTS WITH ME.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.103
AND THERE WERE
OTHERS, TOO.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.104
OH...
YEAH.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.139
THERE WAS THE BUTCHER,

17:52.172 --> 17:53.440
THREE OF YOUR GYM
TEACHERS--

17:53.473 --> 17:54.474
OKAY...
MAYOR DINKINS--

17:54.507 --> 17:55.675
OKAY, I GET IT,
I GET IT!

17:55.708 --> 17:57.344
PEOPLE WERE
INTO YOU, MA.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.778
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO OUT
WITH ANY OF THESE GUYS?

17:58.811 --> 17:59.646
HUH? WHY DIDN'T YOU
GO OUT WITH THEM?

17:59.679 --> 18:02.815
BECAUSE YOU AND RICHIE
WERE SO LET DOWN

18:02.849 --> 18:05.352
WHEN YOUR DAD LEFT,

18:05.385 --> 18:07.120
I JUST COULDN'T BRING
ANOTHER GUY INTO THE HOUSE

18:07.154 --> 18:10.157
WHO COULD DISAPPOINT
YOU AGAIN.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.595
YOU'RE A SAINT, MA.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.497
NO, YOU ARE.
NOT THE BS KIND,

18:17.530 --> 18:20.333
LIKE MOTHER TERESA.
YOU...

18:20.367 --> 18:21.568
YOU ARE A REAL
SAINT.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.704
I DIDN'T MIND
GIVING UP DATING.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.306
YOU KNOW WHY?

18:26.339 --> 18:29.176
WHY?
'CAUSE I HAD YOU.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.611
MY NUMBER ONE BOY.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.481
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.815
YOU HURT MY FEELINGS.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.918
I KNOW I'M NOT BRAD PITT
OR GEORGE CLOONEY

18:38.951 --> 18:41.454
OR MATT DAMON
OR CASEY AFFLECK

18:41.488 --> 18:43.423
OR JAMES CAAN'S SON--
OKAY, PLEASE STOP NAMING

18:43.456 --> 18:44.424
THE CAST OF OCEAN'S ELEVEN.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.692
OCEAN'S THIRTEEN.
LOOK,

18:45.725 --> 18:48.528
I AM SORRY THAT I SAID THAT
TAMRA COULD DO BETTER THAN YOU.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.362
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.331
WHAT IF I CAN'T
DO BETTER THAN TAMRA?

18:51.364 --> 18:53.300
WHAT? OF COURSE
YOU CAN, MORGAN.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.467
YOU'RE THOUGHTFUL
AND KIND,

18:54.501 --> 18:55.535
AND YOU'RE THE BEST AT
LIFTING THINGS

18:55.568 --> 18:58.371
OF ANYBODY AT THE OFFICE.

18:58.405 --> 18:59.239
[grunting]

18:59.272 --> 19:01.474
YEAH, THAT'S REALLY
FUNNY AND COOL.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.410
AH...
FORGET ABOUT TAMRA.
THERE'S MANY GIRLS

19:03.443 --> 19:05.445
WHO WOULD BE LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU, I SWEAR.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.280
OW!
UH-UH!

19:07.314 --> 19:08.748
YOU'RE THE OLD LADY
WHO STOLE MY MAN?

19:08.781 --> 19:10.217
STOP IT!
I KNEW IT!

19:10.250 --> 19:11.851
I SEE THE WAY YOU
LOOK AT HIS BODY!

19:11.884 --> 19:13.520
I LOOK AT ALL MEN LIKE THAT!
I'M KIND OF A PERVERT!

19:13.553 --> 19:15.555
I HATE THIS, I HATE
WHEN LADIES FIGHT OVER ME.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.390
I AM NOT DATING MORGAN!

19:17.424 --> 19:18.491
LOOK AT ME!
LOOK AT HIM!

19:18.525 --> 19:19.892
AND HE'S NOT EVEN DATING

19:19.926 --> 19:21.861
DANNY'S MOM--HE'S JUST
DOING IT TO PROVE A POINT.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.530
OH!

19:23.563 --> 19:24.497
A PROVE-A-POINT DATE,
OKAY.

19:24.531 --> 19:27.534
I WENT ON ONE OF THOSE
ONCE WITH YAO MING.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.970
MORGAN...
I MADE A MISTAKE.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.172
WILL YOU TAKE ME BACK?

19:35.442 --> 19:36.909
NO.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.545
WHAT?
I'M SORRY, TAM,

19:38.578 --> 19:41.381
BUT SOMEONE TOLD ME
THAT I'M A GOOD GUY.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.915
AND THERE'S A LOT OF
OTHER LADIES OUT THERE

19:42.949 --> 19:45.485
THAT I NEED TO EXPERIENCE.
DANNY'S MOM.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.554
MAYBE DR. REED'S
GOT A HOT MOM.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.488
I UNDERSTAND.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.723
DO YOU?
MM-HMM.

19:50.757 --> 19:53.426
I UNDERSTAND I HAVE
TWO NEW ENEMIES.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.527
HEY, MOVE!
AH!

19:55.595 --> 19:57.630
SIR? CAN WE
WRAP THIS UP?

19:57.664 --> 20:01.000
(Dr. Ledreau)
MINDY, MINDY!
ANNETTE JUST CALLED,

20:01.033 --> 20:03.236
AND SHE WANTS TO GO
OUT AGAIN!

20:03.270 --> 20:05.338
OH, DR. LEDREAU,
THAT'S SUCH GREAT NEWS!

20:05.372 --> 20:07.440
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN FEELING
KINDA DOWN RECENTLY.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.676
ACTUALLY THINKING
OF RETIRING.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.512
NO!
REALLY? NO!

20:12.545 --> 20:15.382
BUT NOW I FEEL SO
DOGGONE YOUNG,

20:15.415 --> 20:17.484
I COULD WORK FOREVER!

20:17.517 --> 20:21.488
PLUS, ANNETTE'S GOT SOME
BODY ON HER, HUH?

20:29.696 --> 20:32.031
BYE, OLD GIRL.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.335
END OF AN ERA.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.438
MORGAN!
I'M WORKING IN HERE!

20:38.471 --> 20:40.440
SORRY.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.742
I LEFT HALF A REUBEN
SANDWICH IN HERE.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.544
NO IDEA WHERE IT IS.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.978
[thud, clatter]

20:47.447 --> 20:49.716
DR. P, I CAN'T WORK IN
PHLEBOTOMY ANYMORE, BECAUSE--

20:49.749 --> 20:51.584
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
JUST MOVE YOUR DESK IN HERE.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.653
THANK YOU.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.588
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE
THAT WOULD LIKE TO WORK

20:55.622 --> 20:56.923
FROM MY OFFICE?

20:56.956 --> 20:58.591
[knocking on door]
YUP.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.293
DANIEL.
EVEN THOUGH YOUR MOTHER AND I

21:00.327 --> 21:03.530
ARE NOT TOGETHER ANYMORE,
I STILL LOVE YOU.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.497
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW

21:04.531 --> 21:06.032
NOTHING HAPPENED.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.534
BUT SHE TRIED.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.972
(Danny)
THE TWINS ARE LOOKING GOOD
TONIGHT.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.541
(Mindy)
MM-HMM.

21:14.574 --> 21:15.508
AND IF YOU GOT ME THAT
BOOB JOB I'VE BEEN

21:15.542 --> 21:17.477
BEGGING FOR,
THEY'D ALWAYS BE THIS BUOYANT.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.645
GOD, THEY LOOK HUGE.

21:18.678 --> 21:21.314
[knocking at door]
(Annette)
DANNY,

21:21.348 --> 21:22.449
ARE YOU IN THERE?
I BROUGHT DOT.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.450
(Dot)
HI DANNY!

21:23.483 --> 21:24.884
WE'RE HAVING AN
EROTIC BATH!

21:24.917 --> 21:26.953
(Annette)
YOU WANT ME TO BRING
YOU IN SOME ZITI?

21:26.986 --> 21:29.589
MM, ZITI'S
PERFECT BATH FOOD.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.459
YEAH, MA,
BRING IN THE ZITI.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.527
(Mindy)
AT LEAST SHE KNOCKED.
