Let me tell you something: over the years,

02:46.792 --> 02:49.751
I have made more money out of gold

05:30.459 --> 05:33.001

don't have outstanding loans elsewhere

06:15.001 --> 06:18.751
or you can't guarantee that you'll
pay us back, then I can't help.

06:19.084 --> 06:20.542
Well, I can.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.292
I can guarantee it.

06:22.459 --> 06:25.834
What? That you'll pay it back
or you don't have outstanding loans?

06:25.959 --> 06:27.584

I thought my time had come.

12:51.792 --> 12:53.126
Quit while you were ahead.

12:53.251 --> 12:54.709
I wasn't ahead.

12:54.834 --> 12:56.251
That was the trouble.

12:57.459 --> 12:59.584
If you'd have been in, I might have been.

13:07.126 --> 13:09.042
There was a bit of talk at the funeral.

13:09.167 --> 13:11.292
No, there wasn't.

13:11.417 --> 13:13.126
- Not at that funeral.
- OK.

13:19.751 --> 13:22.626
I haven't been to Hatton Garden
in 25 years, son.

13:23.001 --> 13:24.959
- Not since the glory days.
- (chuckles)

13:27.126 --> 13:29.417
Well, if you don't have a go,
somebody else will.

13:41.126 --> 13:45.709
Turns out I know someone
who knows someone who has a key.

13:46.376 --> 13:47.959
As it happens.

13:48.084 --> 13:50.001
Someone in the business.

13:50.126 --> 13:51.459
Now you tell me.

13:52.626 --> 13:54.292
Yeah, well, I only just thought of it.

13:54.417 --> 13:57.751
Oh, get over it. You've been
wanting to tell me all evening.

13:58.376 --> 14:00.626
That's why you offered to mow my lawn.

14:04.834 --> 14:06.876
Why didn't you say so before?

14:08.376 --> 14:10.001
I'm nervous about it.

14:12.542 --> 14:13.876
So am I.

15:41.876 --> 15:44.167
<i>Tell me about this friend of yours.</i>

15:44.292 --> 15:46.126
<i>The one with the key.</i>

15:46.251 --> 15:47.334
<i>Her husband was in gold.</i>

15:47.459 --> 15:49.792
<i>- He had an office in the building.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

15:49.917 --> 15:52.126
<i>I used to sell him the odd thing
from time to time.</i>

15:52.792 --> 15:54.084
<i>When he died, she asked me</i>

15:54.209 --> 15:57.209
<i>if I could go into the office
and clear it out, you know.</i>

15:57.334 --> 15:59.459
<i>Get rid of anything
that could be connected to her.</i>

15:59.584 --> 16:01.209
<i>She trusted you with the key?</i>

16:01.334 --> 16:04.167
Yeah, she couldn't go in herself,
could she? It's too risky.

16:04.292 --> 16:06.084
Risky?

16:06.209 --> 16:07.959
Yeah, Brian.
There's a lot of crooks about.

16:08.084 --> 16:10.167
Oh, yeah, they're all bent down here.

16:10.459 --> 16:12.001
Part of the mystique.

16:14.251 --> 16:15.501
- (whirring)
<i>- Look, see this?</i>

16:15.626 --> 16:18.167
E, D, F, that's a pure diamond.

16:18.292 --> 16:21.334
It's colourless,
so it lets in the most light.

16:21.959 --> 16:24.334
Up there, X, Y, Z.

16:24.459 --> 16:27.126
You cut that too shallow,
you lose the light out of the bottom.

16:27.251 --> 16:30.459
You cut it too deep,
you lose the light out of the side.

16:31.042 --> 16:34.084
FL, that's a flawless diamond.

16:35.209 --> 16:39.334
A flawless diamond,
cut well, in the right light,

16:40.126 --> 16:42.167
is the strangest thing

16:42.292 --> 16:45.417
and the most beautiful thing
you will ever see.

16:46.542 --> 16:47.792
It's true.

16:48.751 --> 16:50.834
They'll be in the vault
over the weekend.

16:53.584 --> 16:56.042
How much is a flawless
six-carat diamond worth?

16:57.001 --> 16:59.084
A million quid to you.

17:00.084 --> 17:02.084
How many of those are in the vault?

17:02.209 --> 17:03.834
A few.

17:03.959 --> 17:05.584
You only need a few.

17:24.709 --> 17:27.291
One... three, nine.

17:27.791 --> 17:28.876
What's wrong?

17:29.001 --> 17:31.042
I'm just checking for wear on the pads.

17:31.167 --> 17:33.709
You can work out the code
by identifying the most worn ones.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.917
Oh, I see.

17:37.292 --> 17:38.626
No.

17:40.376 --> 17:42.417
Take your own time, son.

17:42.542 --> 17:44.751
It's just a process of elimination.

17:45.167 --> 17:46.417
No kidding.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.501
- (double bleep)
- Yeah.

17:49.626 --> 17:51.042
- Cor blimey.
- (alarm)

17:52.751 --> 17:54.959
Right, that's the 60-second alarm.

17:56.042 --> 17:59.209
There's another in the vault with
a GPS feed to a monitoring system.

17:59.876 --> 18:01.334
Does she know the code?

18:01.459 --> 18:03.001
No, I don't need the code.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.292
It's a 20-year-old wireless, unencrypted.

18:08.084 --> 18:10.626
- You know what that means?
- I don't as it happens.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.501
Unauthenticated signals.

18:20.792 --> 18:22.876
(alarm stops)

18:23.292 --> 18:26.584
You know this lift
won't go down to the basement.

18:26.792 --> 18:28.334
What? It's disabled?

18:28.459 --> 18:29.792
Why would they do that?

18:29.917 --> 18:32.751
Because the ride down
takes you to the airlock,

18:32.876 --> 18:35.001
where you can
open the security gate.

18:38.126 --> 18:40.917
Someone tried it, 20 years ago.

18:41.626 --> 18:46.292
Which is why the security company
stopped it from going down.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.084
But I got a better idea.

18:51.459 --> 18:54.709
If we can stop this lift
on the third floor,

18:55.167 --> 18:58.376
we can go down the shaft
and the vault is ours.

18:58.709 --> 19:01.209
Its a 20-foot drop.

19:03.167 --> 19:04.626
Don't sprain your ankle.

19:04.751 --> 19:06.876
Well, how do we
get through the vault door?

19:07.001 --> 19:09.167
We don't.
We go through a hole in the wall.

19:09.292 --> 19:11.209
We drill as big a hole as possible

19:11.334 --> 19:13.876
and we look for the most
undernourished thief we can find

19:14.001 --> 19:15.917
and it's off to the races.

19:25.792 --> 19:27.626
Are you counting?

19:27.751 --> 19:29.542
Counting?

19:29.667 --> 19:32.542
Yeah, aren't you supposed to be
counting the cameras?

19:33.167 --> 19:35.417
Oh, yeah, five in the street.

19:37.209 --> 19:40.376
Two here in the lobby,
two in the vault, two outside the vault.

19:40.876 --> 19:43.417
One in the entrance and then
whatever's on the upper floors.

19:43.626 --> 19:46.376
Fucking hell, what about my privacy?

19:49.542 --> 19:51.584
We take the gear in through the back door.

19:51.959 --> 19:55.792
It's Easter. They got two days
before they raise the alarm.

19:55.917 --> 20:00.501
And we can get the fuck out in 48 hours
and fence the gems.

20:00.626 --> 20:02.042
(dog barks)

20:04.209 --> 20:06.251
Why are you smiling?

20:06.376 --> 20:07.542
I'm just excited.

20:08.834 --> 20:13.001
If you enjoy this fucking job,
you're not doing it properly.

20:14.501 --> 20:16.167
All right.

20:16.292 --> 20:17.334
You enjoy it.

20:17.459 --> 20:19.042
Well, that's the point.

20:19.167 --> 20:20.834
I'm allowed.

20:20.959 --> 20:23.376
Things like this give me purpose.

20:28.709 --> 20:30.542
BRIAN:
You know what, Carl?

20:30.667 --> 20:34.251
Those lemon trees
are not gonna survive the winter.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.584
That's a cheery thought.
I didn't know that.

20:36.709 --> 20:39.751
You gotta wrap your lemons
against the cold, Carl.

20:40.292 --> 20:41.667
Everybody knows that.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.876
So what brings you out here, then, Brian?

20:47.417 --> 20:49.251
Have you lost weight?

20:50.792 --> 20:52.876
Just keeping fit sort of thing.

20:53.876 --> 20:55.626
Can you lose some more?

20:56.501 --> 20:58.376
What d'you mean?

20:58.501 --> 21:01.001
Well, a few more inches off your arse
for a start.

21:01.126 --> 21:03.209
- What?
- He said what?

21:03.334 --> 21:07.792
Yeah, I'm sensitive about it
cos I'm getting older.

21:08.542 --> 21:11.292
- It's harder the older you get.
- Yeah.

21:11.417 --> 21:13.959
I mean, I'm practically living
hand-to-mouth at the minute.

21:14.584 --> 21:15.626
Yeah?

21:15.751 --> 21:18.084
I'm on bleeding disability now, you know.

21:19.001 --> 21:21.834
- What is it, your bowel?
- No, they reckon it's a nervous thing.

21:21.959 --> 21:25.667
Yeah, well, nerves and bowels
go hand in hand, don't they?

21:26.959 --> 21:30.209
See, I don't, like, want,
like, a lavish lifestyle.

21:30.334 --> 21:33.626
- I don't have a lavish lifestyle.
- What are you talking about?

21:33.751 --> 21:37.126
- You got a bungalow.
- I deserve a fucking bungalow at my age.

21:37.709 --> 21:39.751
(phone rings)

21:39.876 --> 21:41.959
(groans)

21:45.376 --> 21:46.209
Hello, Tel.

21:46.626 --> 21:48.501
We're gonna take the Pentonville Road.

21:48.626 --> 21:50.251
<i>- Pentonville?</i>
- Pentonville.

21:50.376 --> 21:52.459
<i>All right, please yourself.</i>

21:52.834 --> 21:55.334
- Is Carl with ya?
<i>- Yes, he is.</i>

21:55.459 --> 21:58.001
- How's his arse?
- I don't know, I'll ask him.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.251
How's your arse?

22:00.376 --> 22:01.792
My arse?

22:01.917 --> 22:03.917
It's pretty relaxed as it goes.

22:05.126 --> 22:07.209
He says his arse is relaxed.

22:07.584 --> 22:08.792
<i>What are you driving?</i>

22:08.917 --> 22:11.459
<i>Not that fucking Mr Magoo football thing,
are you?</i>

22:11.584 --> 22:13.042
Oh, fuck off.

22:13.167 --> 22:14.209
What?

22:14.334 --> 22:16.584
He taking the piss
out of your motor again, is he?

22:16.709 --> 22:18.209
"Mr Fucking Magoo."

22:18.334 --> 22:21.167
I had the Mini, the Grenada,
the Ford Escort,

22:21.292 --> 22:24.167
the Morris Marina van
and the Astra Estate.

22:24.542 --> 22:26.126
I was on the run for 17 years.

22:26.251 --> 22:27.959
What does he expect, a fucking E-type?

22:28.084 --> 22:29.584
(laughs)

22:29.709 --> 22:32.292
♪ JOHN MAYALL'S BLUESBREAKERS:
Steppin' Out

22:54.209 --> 22:57.501
- Fucking state of that.
- It's a very nice motor, as it happens.

22:57.626 --> 22:58.959
BRIAN:
Hatton Gardens.

22:59.084 --> 23:00.251
Easter.

23:00.376 --> 23:01.626
Commercial company.

23:01.751 --> 23:03.084
No-one at home.

23:03.209 --> 23:04.584
No weapons.

23:04.709 --> 23:06.917
- No shooter?
- Well, that's a bit boring, innit?

23:07.042 --> 23:08.959
It's not boring if you get caught.

23:09.084 --> 23:11.542
It's 23 years for armed robbery.

23:11.667 --> 23:13.834
Without a shooter, it's five.

23:13.959 --> 23:16.584
Ain't a proper burglary if there's
no-one there, though, is it?

23:16.709 --> 23:19.709
What are you... You like
seeing people shit their self, you lads?

23:19.834 --> 23:22.334
- I like the buzz.
- Oh, there's monitored alarms

23:22.459 --> 23:25.542
if you wanna shit yourself. My young
friend with the key will deal with that.

23:25.667 --> 23:26.792
What's his story, Brian?

23:26.917 --> 23:30.334
I mean, why's he wanna come in with us
if he's got his own set of keys?

23:30.459 --> 23:31.584
He wants muscle.

23:31.709 --> 23:33.584
Barking up the wrong tree here,
then, ain't he?

23:33.876 --> 23:37.001
Yeah, well, I went after him
for the Bond Street job

23:37.126 --> 23:39.542
and he got cold feet at the last minute.

23:39.667 --> 23:42.042
- Well, he's no use to us, then, is he?
- He's all we've got.

23:42.167 --> 23:44.126
I'm not waiting around
for a load of Albanians

23:44.251 --> 23:45.959
to come across from the Dartford Gap.

23:46.084 --> 23:47.334
Or Poles.

23:47.459 --> 23:49.334
Poles?

23:49.459 --> 23:51.334
I won't hear a word
said against the Poles.

23:51.459 --> 23:55.334
You ever tried making a patio
without Poles in this country?

23:55.459 --> 23:57.917
Can they get me a nice diamond bit
for my drill?

23:58.042 --> 23:59.834
Someone on eBay'll have something.

23:59.959 --> 24:01.001
Fuck off, eBay!

24:01.126 --> 24:02.959
Don't even know how to get fucking eBay.

24:03.084 --> 24:05.917
- You just get it up on your screen.
- I don't have it on my computer.

24:06.042 --> 24:08.834
Course you got it. What you mean
you ain't got it on your computer?

24:08.959 --> 24:10.792
I don't have the technology!

24:10.917 --> 24:13.709
If you can find one, get one for us.

24:13.834 --> 24:15.084
Stop fannying about.

24:15.209 --> 24:18.334
Anybody'd think the whole world
revolved around the fucking internet.

24:18.459 --> 24:19.917
OTHERS:
Well, it fucking does!

24:35.876 --> 24:37.001
Well, come on, son.

24:37.126 --> 24:39.084
Get lively. Mingle.

24:39.209 --> 24:41.084
All right, son?

24:41.209 --> 24:42.709
Yeah, yeah, all right.

24:42.834 --> 24:45.417
I call him Basil Brush
cos he's a bit plummy.

24:45.542 --> 24:46.751
Yeah.

24:50.751 --> 24:52.501
He's a bloody good spark, though.

24:52.626 --> 24:54.834
He rewired my whole house.

24:56.917 --> 24:58.292
What's the matter with you?

24:58.417 --> 25:00.042
Well, he, he doesn't like crowds.

25:00.167 --> 25:01.459
- Don't he?
- No.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.792
What's up, son? Got cold feet?

25:06.167 --> 25:07.459
- Have you?
- What?

25:07.584 --> 25:08.667
- Got cold feet.
- No.

25:08.792 --> 25:10.292
- Good.
- You'll be all right.

25:10.417 --> 25:11.709
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:11.834 --> 25:13.001
He'll be all right.

25:13.209 --> 25:16.084
Right, obviously this is Hatton Garden
here and here's the entrance.

25:16.209 --> 25:18.251
We're gonna have an office
over here for lookout.

25:18.376 --> 25:19.834
And that's where you'll be, Kenny.

25:21.084 --> 25:24.751
- What's going on?
- 86 opens up at nine.

25:24.876 --> 25:26.876
Danny, you're gonna go up
to the first floor, call the lift.

25:27.209 --> 25:30.626
Right, that's where you'll disable...
That's the fuse box.

25:37.417 --> 25:38.459
(clunk of car door)

25:38.584 --> 25:40.459
This is inconspicuous.

25:40.584 --> 25:42.501
Like a liquorice fucking allsort.

25:42.626 --> 25:45.209
We could get a white van, like a gas man.

25:45.334 --> 25:47.376
Nobody talks to a gas man.

25:48.542 --> 25:49.667
(bleeping)

25:50.626 --> 25:51.917
(bleep)

26:01.459 --> 26:02.584
Come on.

26:05.876 --> 26:07.751
Think I've done my knee pinging that door.

26:07.876 --> 26:09.167
Put your ointment on it.

26:09.292 --> 26:10.959
It's not that kind of ointment.

26:13.792 --> 26:15.001
There you go, son.

26:27.417 --> 26:29.834
The hole that we're gonna drill
is gonna be here.

26:31.251 --> 26:33.292
Probably have to drill
three holes back to back.

26:33.417 --> 26:34.917
Takes 30 minutes each one.

26:35.042 --> 26:37.209
That's an hour and a half
of pure drilling.

26:37.626 --> 26:40.376
Your body'll go through
but your fucking head won't.

26:40.501 --> 26:41.709
Once we've drilled the holes,

26:41.834 --> 26:44.459
all we're gonna see
is the backside of one of the cabinets.

26:44.584 --> 26:46.667
BRIAN:
<i>We've gotta ram and we can move it.</i>

26:52.209 --> 26:53.626
Come on.

27:17.959 --> 27:19.501
Is that corned beef?

27:19.626 --> 27:21.834
Yeah, and a Thermos.

27:22.292 --> 27:24.042
How's your new hip going, Ken?

27:25.001 --> 27:26.126
Ken?

27:26.792 --> 27:28.042
Ken?

27:28.709 --> 27:30.584
He's deaf as a post.

27:31.251 --> 27:32.792
(bleep of signal)

27:32.917 --> 27:34.251
(amplified):
Ken!

27:34.376 --> 27:35.709
Your new hip, is it all right?

27:35.834 --> 27:37.001
Oh, yeah, lovely.

27:37.126 --> 27:38.334
Yeah, handsome.

27:39.001 --> 27:40.292
What's that?

27:40.417 --> 27:41.501
You type 2?

27:42.001 --> 27:43.751
- What?
- Your diabetes.

27:43.876 --> 27:45.584
- Are you type 2?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

27:45.709 --> 27:48.334
- Type 2, yeah. You?
- Yeah, I'm type 2 too.

27:48.459 --> 27:49.667
20 pills a day.

27:49.792 --> 27:51.959
Three insulin injections
or I'm Andy Pandy.

27:52.084 --> 27:55.209
- Straight up. I go all floppy.
- (laughs)

27:55.334 --> 27:57.626
You should take
a couple of days' supply with ya.

27:57.751 --> 27:59.876
I have to, or I'm a dead duck.

28:01.334 --> 28:03.042
(whines)

28:11.542 --> 28:12.751
(whines)

28:43.626 --> 28:45.751
What have you done to your barnet?

28:46.542 --> 28:48.459
I'm in disguise.

28:48.584 --> 28:50.501
There's cameras everywhere.

28:58.417 --> 28:59.501
(double bleep)

28:59.626 --> 29:01.709
(alarm)

29:04.709 --> 29:06.792
That's a proper fright wig, that is.

29:06.917 --> 29:08.167
That's a proper "Uncle Fester

29:08.292 --> 29:12.209
send-in-the-clowns, whoops-a-daisy,
have-an-away-day", that is.

29:12.334 --> 29:14.167
(alarm stops)

29:14.292 --> 29:16.417
You're not a fucking mod, are you?

29:18.251 --> 29:19.876
(lift bell pings)

29:20.001 --> 29:22.251
All ashore that's going ashore.

29:38.459 --> 29:40.876
Here he is. Digital Boy Wonder.

29:41.501 --> 29:43.959
- It's a nice little syrup you got there.
- No.

29:44.084 --> 29:46.876
What are you, Sugar Plum Fairy?
Are you on the pull or something?

29:47.001 --> 29:49.584
- Don't touch. I don't like being touched.
- I'll do whatever I like

29:49.709 --> 29:51.459
and you'll enjoy it.

29:59.584 --> 30:01.042
Bloody hell.

30:16.376 --> 30:17.542
(bleep of signal)

30:20.292 --> 30:22.001
That one, Brian.

30:23.626 --> 30:25.001
Get chiselling.

30:34.376 --> 30:35.626
All yours.

30:38.501 --> 30:40.001
Here.

30:42.876 --> 30:45.084
Why am I doing the dangerous bits?

30:45.834 --> 30:47.459
You're the youngest.

30:57.542 --> 30:58.834
All right?

30:59.042 --> 31:00.334
Fuck me.

31:00.667 --> 31:01.792
(groans)

31:02.251 --> 31:03.292
Come on.

31:03.417 --> 31:04.792
Easy, easy.

31:05.501 --> 31:07.501
You've done this before, son.

31:07.959 --> 31:09.167
All right?

31:22.501 --> 31:23.834
OK, it's in, it's in, it's in.

31:23.959 --> 31:26.417
All right, remember,
once the alarm goes,

31:26.834 --> 31:29.167
we got 60 seconds
before the monitored feed kicks in.

31:29.334 --> 31:32.209
If we don't get in there and stop it,
they'll be on to us.

31:32.334 --> 31:34.001
Come on, then.

31:37.709 --> 31:39.792
(alarm)

31:43.167 --> 31:44.584
Well done, mate.

31:47.584 --> 31:49.667
(alarm continues)

32:04.876 --> 32:06.334
Fuck...

32:13.459 --> 32:15.542
(alarm stops)

32:20.542 --> 32:21.876
(thudding)

32:22.751 --> 32:24.251
- (exhales)
- (chuckles)

32:26.251 --> 32:27.376
All right.

32:29.542 --> 32:31.501
Hello.

32:31.626 --> 32:33.417
Basil.

32:34.459 --> 32:35.917
(entry buzzer)

32:39.709 --> 32:42.126
What's that little red light blinking for?

32:47.751 --> 32:49.834
(alarm)

32:52.751 --> 32:54.834
- (alarm continues)
- (he snores)

32:55.709 --> 32:57.209
Is it going off now?

32:57.334 --> 32:59.542
Yeah, I think it probably is somewhere,
yeah.

32:59.667 --> 33:01.751
What do you propose to do about that?

33:03.459 --> 33:04.917
Kenny?

33:05.042 --> 33:06.959
Come in, Kenny.

33:08.501 --> 33:10.584
(alarm continues)

33:12.626 --> 33:13.917
Ken?

33:14.042 --> 33:15.084
Kenny?

33:15.209 --> 33:17.292
- (snoring)
<i>- Kenny, there's an alarm.</i>

33:17.417 --> 33:19.167
<i>I need you to respond appropriately.</i>

33:19.292 --> 33:20.626
(continues snoring)

33:27.417 --> 33:28.626
(door opens)

33:28.751 --> 33:31.292
Kenny! Wake up, you fucking wally.
We triggered an alarm.

33:31.417 --> 33:33.126
What the fuck
d'you want me to do about it?

33:33.251 --> 33:35.334
Just stay awake.

33:36.626 --> 33:38.376
Right, well, just keep your eyes skinned.

33:38.501 --> 33:40.584
And sort out your hearing aid.

33:52.126 --> 33:53.459
Excuse me, are you a member?

33:53.584 --> 33:55.667
Fucking am now.

33:59.376 --> 34:00.376
There and there.

34:00.501 --> 34:02.167
(alarm continues)

34:02.292 --> 34:03.959
Now let it go, let it go.

34:13.833 --> 34:15.333
Here we go.

34:15.458 --> 34:16.751
That's it, I'll hold it.

34:18.958 --> 34:20.167
(whirring)

34:22.583 --> 34:24.251
BRIAN:
Water, Carl.

34:32.876 --> 34:34.958
(alarm continues)

34:39.792 --> 34:41.667
(alarm stops)

34:43.251 --> 34:44.751
(coughs)

35:06.292 --> 35:07.626
Trouble up at mill, lads.

35:08.667 --> 35:11.709
<i>Security. White Astra.</i>

35:11.834 --> 35:13.626
<i>Uniform.</i>

35:13.751 --> 35:15.834
<i>Definitely casing us.</i>

35:17.042 --> 35:20.501
Either he's responding to the alarm

35:21.334 --> 35:24.459
or it's a coincidence
and he's just being nosy.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.334
<i>He's gone round the side.</i>

35:29.459 --> 35:31.292
Yeah.

35:31.417 --> 35:34.084
Yeah, I can't see him. I can't. He's...

35:37.709 --> 35:39.792
<i>Yeah, he's coming back. There he is.</i>

35:41.001 --> 35:42.584
Oh, he's...

35:42.709 --> 35:44.251
Oh, I think he's trying to get in.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.459
Fuck.

35:47.876 --> 35:50.584
Hang on. He's not trying very hard.

35:51.709 --> 35:54.001
Yeah. He's going.

35:55.001 --> 35:57.084
He's going.

35:58.167 --> 35:59.542
<i>He's effed off.</i>

36:02.417 --> 36:04.042
- Yeah, lovely.
- (engine starts)

36:04.626 --> 36:06.334
Thank Gawd for that.

36:06.459 --> 36:07.834
That was a close one, chaps.

36:07.959 --> 36:10.209
Carry on. Carry on working.

36:53.834 --> 36:55.334
DAN:
(echoes): Terry...

36:56.459 --> 36:57.709
Terence.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.834
You all right, Tel?

37:02.626 --> 37:04.542
(turns drill off)

37:04.667 --> 37:07.084
- (exhales)
- You all right? All right?

37:07.209 --> 37:08.959
Bit wobbly.

37:10.209 --> 37:11.292
How you doing, Carl?

37:11.417 --> 37:13.417
Get on there, Carl.

37:14.792 --> 37:16.292
He's a bit...

37:19.334 --> 37:21.167
- Oh.
- (whirring)

37:22.126 --> 37:24.001
- (clatter)
- Oh, fuck me.

37:25.251 --> 37:26.959
I saw it fall off.

37:30.542 --> 37:31.709
On there, yeah, on there.

37:31.834 --> 37:33.209
- Which one?
- Ow.

37:34.167 --> 37:35.876
Put it over your, oh, cor blimey!

37:36.001 --> 37:37.542
All right.

37:37.667 --> 37:39.751
(burst of whirring)

37:41.709 --> 37:44.834
Get out the fucking way, get out the way.
Get out the way.

37:45.626 --> 37:48.042
Look, look, look. Look, gentle. Gentle.

37:50.042 --> 37:52.126
All right? It ain't a fucking hammer.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.626
I've got it, Tel. Yep.

38:17.251 --> 38:19.126
Right.

38:19.334 --> 38:21.876
- There you go.
BRIAN: That's the back of the cabinet.

38:22.459 --> 38:23.709
- That's it.
- Look at that.

38:23.834 --> 38:26.626
All right, let's knock this fucker down.
Give us the bracket.

38:27.709 --> 38:29.792
All right.

38:31.751 --> 38:32.917
Sort the space...

38:35.709 --> 38:37.501
Looking good. Looking good!

38:39.834 --> 38:41.417
There you go.

38:41.542 --> 38:43.209
All right, Dan?

38:43.917 --> 38:45.167
- We in?
- Yeah, that lot can go.

38:45.292 --> 38:46.626
All right, here we go.

38:52.084 --> 38:54.084
- Give it some.
- I am giving it some.

38:56.876 --> 38:59.876
I don't think it's moving. That cabinet
must be bolted to the floor.

39:00.084 --> 39:01.917
I think you're right.

39:02.042 --> 39:03.876
You said it would move.

39:04.251 --> 39:06.084
I never said it would move.

39:06.209 --> 39:08.376
I said, you gotta move it.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.876
Go on. Go on.

39:16.334 --> 39:17.751
Ah, shit! Shit!

39:17.876 --> 39:19.667
- Fuck me!
- (cackles)

39:19.792 --> 39:22.501
- Oh, I don't believe it.
- All over my nuts.

39:22.709 --> 39:24.167
Fuck me.

39:24.292 --> 39:26.459
- What's it say on that?
- It's got to be perpendicular.

39:26.584 --> 39:29.001
- That's got to be perpendicular?
- It is perpendicular.

39:29.126 --> 39:30.959
- Got to be exactly...
- Perpendicular to what?

39:31.084 --> 39:32.459
- The wall.
- It's got to be bang on.

39:32.584 --> 39:35.751
It can't be slightly perpendicular
or vaguely perpendicular.

39:35.876 --> 39:38.376
- You said you could do this.
- I said I could get through the hole.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.917
- I didn't say anything about all this.
- Get through a hole?

39:41.042 --> 39:44.501
- Is that the limit of your expertise?
- You get through the bleedin' hole, then!

39:44.626 --> 39:47.917
That's destroyed. That's unfixable.
You have to get another one.

39:48.042 --> 39:51.834
- I thought you could fix anything.
- Anything electrical. Anything but this.

39:51.959 --> 39:54.876
- This and alarms.
- No, I deactivated the live alarm.

39:55.001 --> 39:56.542
It was the GPS that confused me.

39:56.667 --> 39:59.084
In this game, there's what you know
and what you don't know.

39:59.209 --> 40:02.792
If you don't even fucking know what
you don't know, you know fuck all!

40:03.542 --> 40:05.167
Well, that's great, innit?

40:05.292 --> 40:07.209
- What are we gonna do now?
- Fuck it.

40:10.376 --> 40:12.709
Stay here and I'll come back
in the morning with a new one.

40:12.834 --> 40:15.709
I ain't staying down here all night
with you lot farting and snoring!

40:15.834 --> 40:18.459
No, I ain't sleeping down here
with all this dust and shit.

40:18.584 --> 40:21.126
Make a bed in the corner
out of old newspapers and stuff.

40:21.251 --> 40:23.376
Bed in the corner?
What am I, an Aborigine?

40:23.501 --> 40:25.959
I'll make you a nice little bed
in the corner, Terry,

40:26.084 --> 40:27.376
tuck you up good and proper.

40:27.501 --> 40:30.126
Yeah, Dan, you tuck me up.
I'll enjoy that.

40:31.626 --> 40:33.459
It's like waiting
for a fucking egg to boil.

40:33.584 --> 40:36.001
- Who got you this job, your caseworker?
- Piss off.

40:36.126 --> 40:39.001
I did. And you know it.

40:39.126 --> 40:41.292
You're a piss-poor judge of character,
ain't you, Brian?

40:41.459 --> 40:44.292
"Oh, I'm so rotten, I'm a piss-poor
judge of character."

40:44.417 --> 40:46.459
Didn't your Lyn never teach you nothing?

40:46.584 --> 40:48.751
Leave her out of it.

40:48.876 --> 40:50.792
I can't believe she stayed with you.

40:51.834 --> 40:54.084
What's the matter with you, Terry?

40:54.626 --> 40:56.126
Still bitter?

40:56.584 --> 40:59.542
Still got an axe to grind
after all these years?

40:59.876 --> 41:03.709
If I had an axe to grind, Brian,
you'd be the first to know about it.

41:03.834 --> 41:05.709
Don't try and bully me, son.

41:06.459 --> 41:08.459
I know how to treat bullies.

41:09.251 --> 41:11.376
I'll have you in fucking chunks.

41:12.709 --> 41:14.334
Come on, then.

41:14.667 --> 41:16.376
Have a chunk.

41:17.167 --> 41:19.292
You can tuck me up while you're about it.

41:19.417 --> 41:21.334
Whoa, whoa, turn it in.

41:26.709 --> 41:29.876
We're supposed to be working. Stop puffing
your chests out and take it seriously.

41:30.001 --> 41:33.042
- What the fuck is going on?
- Fuck off, Basil.

41:33.167 --> 41:35.584
Yeah, fuck off, son. Leave it to me.

41:36.667 --> 41:40.376
- (bleep of signal)
KEN: <i>Everything tickety-boo down there?</i>

41:42.376 --> 41:44.292
Dig a grave.

41:44.417 --> 41:45.626
They're fucking killing me.

41:50.417 --> 41:52.292
BRIAN:
We're coming back tonight.

42:04.376 --> 42:07.584
RADIO: <i>Good morning and welcome to
a special Easter edition of the show...</i>

42:07.709 --> 42:09.334
KEN:
Special Easter edition.

42:09.459 --> 42:10.792
It's all right for some.

42:10.917 --> 42:13.084
DAN: Yeah, some of us
have to work for a living.

42:40.709 --> 42:43.501
(groans) Desperate for a piss.

42:50.126 --> 42:52.209

42:56.917 --> 42:59.001
(continues humming)

43:02.292 --> 43:04.376
(trickling)

43:09.209 --> 43:10.417
Fuck off!

43:15.209 --> 43:17.209
Fucking hell.

43:29.751 --> 43:34.334
Er, Brian, yeah.
Well, this is Milly's brother Billy.

43:35.709 --> 43:37.792
Milly's brother Billy?

43:38.251 --> 43:39.667
Fuck off.

43:39.792 --> 43:40.959
Billy Lincoln.

43:41.084 --> 43:42.751
Billy the Fish.

43:42.876 --> 43:44.626
Billy the bloody Fish?

43:44.751 --> 43:46.167
What kind of name's that?

43:46.292 --> 43:48.834
Well, he works at
Billingsgate Fish Market.

43:48.959 --> 43:50.667
He's brung you a present.

43:50.792 --> 43:52.167
See, he's a fence.

43:52.501 --> 43:55.584
Well, he was gonna help us out
moving the goods.

43:56.751 --> 43:58.042
Not today he ain't.

43:58.167 --> 44:00.542
Well, I thought we could use
an extra pair of hands.

44:00.667 --> 44:02.459
How much does he know?

44:02.584 --> 44:04.126
And what about the others?

44:04.459 --> 44:07.334
I was gonna tell them gradual.

44:07.751 --> 44:08.876
Gradual?

44:09.209 --> 44:13.334
You wanna tell Terry Perkins "gradual"
and see what he makes of it?

44:13.459 --> 44:14.917
Eh?

44:15.042 --> 44:17.292
This'll put the kibosh on everything.

44:18.751 --> 44:24.376
And you, you tell a single soul about this
and I'll cut your balls off.

44:25.459 --> 44:27.667
That makes no difference to me.

44:27.792 --> 44:29.917
You fat cunt.

44:30.334 --> 44:33.167
I'm out and I'm not coming back.

44:34.376 --> 44:36.376
- (front door slams)
- Nice bloke.

44:37.126 --> 44:38.584
KEN:
<i>Yeah, that's right, Danny.</i>

44:38.709 --> 44:40.834
<i>He says he's out
and he's not coming back.</i>

44:40.959 --> 44:43.042
Hold on.

44:43.167 --> 44:45.417
Reader's lost his arsehole.

44:45.542 --> 44:47.501
Fuck's sake.

44:47.626 --> 44:48.876
Yeah, I know, I know.

44:49.542 --> 44:52.292
Listen, Ken,
let me talk to Terry, all right?

44:54.292 --> 44:55.751
(sighs)

44:56.251 --> 44:59.417
I ain't being funny,
and I don't mean to be rude.

44:59.542 --> 45:02.459
But fuck Brian and fuck his old woman,
God bless her.

45:03.792 --> 45:06.501
I'm not doing this for them,
I'm doing it for me.

45:06.626 --> 45:09.001
He did fuck all down there last night.

45:09.167 --> 45:12.834
And I ain't in the business of
encouraging some old man's vanity.

45:14.542 --> 45:15.792
Do you think he's frit?

45:17.334 --> 45:19.542
Well, in our world
you either stay or you go.

45:20.126 --> 45:23.542
You don't spend all day pissing on
like a leaky colostomy bag, do you?

45:23.667 --> 45:25.417
It's pure cowardice.

45:25.542 --> 45:27.792
He don't wanna help his friends, Dan,
that's his problem.

45:27.917 --> 45:29.251
No, that's the point, Terry.

45:29.876 --> 45:31.667
He ain't got no friends.

45:42.917 --> 45:44.584
TERRY:
<i>All he did was put it together.</i>

45:44.709 --> 45:48.126
Yeah, well, technically he put it
together. Morally he fucked it up again.

45:50.084 --> 45:51.834
Where's Basil in all this?

45:51.959 --> 45:53.417
Taking off his make-up?

45:53.542 --> 45:54.751
What, you think he's a poof?

45:54.876 --> 45:56.459
He sounds like one.

45:56.584 --> 45:58.334
Nah, I just think he talks proper.

45:58.459 --> 46:01.376
He's probably from West London.
You know what they're like.

46:11.084 --> 46:13.167
(van drives off)

46:18.667 --> 46:21.917
- Some fucker's locked it!
- There might be someone in there.

46:22.042 --> 46:24.126
If this is a fit-up,
I'm gonna do my canister.

46:24.251 --> 46:26.709
I'll lose my loaf,
I'm fucking telling you now.

46:26.834 --> 46:28.292
Where the fuck is Basil?

46:32.459 --> 46:34.709
Everyone thinks you've lost your nerve.

46:36.542 --> 46:37.834
Crooks are like boxers.

46:37.959 --> 46:41.376
They lose their legs first.

46:41.501 --> 46:43.751
Then they lose their reflexes.

46:43.876 --> 46:45.667
Then they lose their friends.

46:46.876 --> 46:48.251
Yeah.

46:49.959 --> 46:51.542
It's just that...

46:53.167 --> 46:54.376
..that hole's there.

46:56.292 --> 46:58.251
Take my advice, son.

46:59.042 --> 47:01.167
Run for your fucking life.

47:04.001 --> 47:06.084
I don't think I can.

47:07.667 --> 47:09.251
<i>Hold up one minute.</i>

47:10.376 --> 47:11.792
<i>Where's my phone?</i>

47:13.584 --> 47:15.876
He won't answer that.
He reckons it's all traceable.

47:16.001 --> 47:19.126
- (ringing tone)
- Can't trace it till Tuesday.

47:19.251 --> 47:21.292
- Why's that?
- It's Easter weekend.

47:21.417 --> 47:22.501
Don't work Easter.

47:23.042 --> 47:25.334
What are you talking about?
They staff it from Bangalore.

47:25.459 --> 47:27.001
It ain't Easter out there, is it?

47:27.126 --> 47:29.876
- Could be Easter there.
- It's fucking India.

47:30.001 --> 47:31.792
It's Easter everywhere, isn't it?

47:33.709 --> 47:37.042
He ain't answering. What you wanna do?

47:37.417 --> 47:39.709
You tell me what to do.
What to look for.

47:40.834 --> 47:42.876
I'll give you 50%.

47:43.209 --> 47:44.626
Of anything I get.

47:51.376 --> 47:52.876
All right, son.

47:54.584 --> 47:56.459
50% it is.

48:01.751 --> 48:05.584
These boxes are the traders
I have done business with.

48:07.167 --> 48:09.334
And that's where
you'll find the best stuff.

48:12.084 --> 48:14.417
- Fucking hell.
- Yeah, fucking hell.

48:16.542 --> 48:17.876
I'm starting to panic now.

48:18.001 --> 48:19.292
I'm really starting to go.

48:19.417 --> 48:21.626
I'm so keyed up,
I'll go fucking ping in a minute.

48:21.751 --> 48:24.251
We're all keyed up, Carl.
We're burglars.

48:24.376 --> 48:26.876
Yeah, but I got problems.
I've got my mum to think about.

48:27.001 --> 48:28.876
She's got bleeding Alzheimer's.

48:29.001 --> 48:30.959
Kenny and Brian are practically dead.

48:31.084 --> 48:33.376
You don't hear them fucking complaining.

48:33.501 --> 48:35.626
You know what your problem is, don't you?

48:35.751 --> 48:37.126
You give it too much of that.

48:37.251 --> 48:38.876
You're a chatterbox, a blabbermouth.

48:39.001 --> 48:40.251
Are you saying I talk too much?

48:40.376 --> 48:42.459
Listen, if you're too scared to stay,
just go.

48:42.584 --> 48:44.917
Don't make a meal of it.
Don't piss down my leg.

48:45.209 --> 48:50.126
Bowels or no bowels, son,
if you wanna go, fuck off.

48:55.042 --> 48:56.459
BRIAN:
<i>Now, remember this.</i>

48:56.584 --> 48:59.959
Anything with an FL is flawless.

49:00.709 --> 49:04.251
Anything with a red dot is dross.

49:05.501 --> 49:08.792
- Are we gonna be able to shift all this?
- We're gonna meet my fence in Margate,

49:08.917 --> 49:12.001
then we're gonna get on a ferry at Dover
and get the fuck out of here.

49:12.834 --> 49:14.667
Oh.

49:14.792 --> 49:16.792
We have to leave the country?

49:16.917 --> 49:19.501
Well, if you carry this off,

49:19.626 --> 49:22.876
every scumbag, chiseller
and ne'er-do-well,

49:23.376 --> 49:25.334
whoever used that vault,

49:26.626 --> 49:28.459
is gonna wanna kill you.

49:30.334 --> 49:32.292
With a spoon.

49:46.459 --> 49:48.584
What sort of time d'you call this,
you cunt?

49:48.709 --> 49:51.501
Where you been? Doing your hair?

49:51.626 --> 49:53.459
What happened to Carl?

50:01.751 --> 50:03.834
- Here we go.
- Yeah.

50:07.626 --> 50:08.792
Yeah.

50:13.334 --> 50:14.876
That's it.

50:15.584 --> 50:17.334
Now.

50:39.834 --> 50:41.292
There. There you go.

50:42.542 --> 50:44.376
Fuck me.

50:44.667 --> 50:46.251
Go on, son.

50:55.709 --> 50:56.876
OK, up we go.

50:57.001 --> 50:58.459
Get me in, get me in.

50:58.584 --> 51:00.667
- Go on.
- Fucking hell.

51:02.709 --> 51:04.126
Go on! You're doing well.

51:04.251 --> 51:06.334
- Here we go.
- Oi, turn me, turn me.

51:06.751 --> 51:08.334
Fuck me sideways.

51:08.459 --> 51:10.542
All right?

51:11.376 --> 51:13.459
Jesus Christ.

51:15.876 --> 51:18.126
- All right?
- That's it. Go on, son.

51:18.751 --> 51:20.251
Well done, mate.

51:22.501 --> 51:24.584
All right?

51:24.834 --> 51:27.709
Don't eat anything while you're in there,
will ya?

51:32.709 --> 51:36.709
(cackles)

51:47.042 --> 51:48.167
That's it.

51:59.876 --> 52:01.251
Readies, Tel?

52:13.459 --> 52:14.709
You ready?

52:21.584 --> 52:23.084
Start loading it, Tel.

52:25.084 --> 52:26.626
Readies. That's one for Mum.

52:28.709 --> 52:30.084
Don't believe these.

52:33.459 --> 52:35.334
Gonna buy a nice little place in Portugal.

52:35.459 --> 52:36.959
Eat a lot of fish.

52:37.084 --> 52:39.584
In the season, rent it out,
charge a monkey a week.

52:39.709 --> 52:40.751
Seven grand a year.

52:40.876 --> 52:44.001
That's my pension, thank you very much.
That's my nest egg.

52:54.001 --> 52:55.501
How's it going?

52:59.917 --> 53:01.584
Bit more coming.

53:31.334 --> 53:32.751
Readies!

53:38.626 --> 53:39.876
Danny.

53:58.042 --> 53:59.751
Do you think he's dead?

54:03.542 --> 54:04.834
Oi.

54:05.584 --> 54:09.459
- Let's go, leave him to pay.
- Yeah. (chuckles)

54:11.626 --> 54:13.959
Let me tell you something about
the Governor.

54:14.084 --> 54:15.417
The master safe cracker.

54:15.542 --> 54:16.751
The master criminal.

54:17.001 --> 54:18.417
The king of thieves.

54:18.876 --> 54:20.376
He's lost his arsehole.

54:20.501 --> 54:21.917
Lost his arsehole. Exactly.

54:22.042 --> 54:23.667
Carl lost his arsehole an' all.

54:23.792 --> 54:26.084
Yeah, well,
that's two lost arseholes right there.

54:26.209 --> 54:28.709
Well, there you go.
The Dance of the Sugar Plum Arseholes.

54:28.834 --> 54:29.959
See?

54:30.084 --> 54:31.334
I don't care about Carl.

54:31.459 --> 54:34.209
Carl's a mushroom,
Carl likes it in the dark.

54:34.334 --> 54:37.417
If fucking Reader had have been there,
we'd have been cake-o bake-o.

54:37.542 --> 54:39.959
You're right, Dan.
He's cost us money when you think of it.

54:40.084 --> 54:41.751
How much has he cost us?
Work it out.

54:41.876 --> 54:43.459
Well, work out the fucking VAT alone.

54:43.751 --> 54:44.709
Yeah.

54:45.042 --> 54:48.001
- I'm a better man than he ever was.
- Yeah.

54:48.126 --> 54:49.667
I'm the fucking Guv now.

54:55.584 --> 54:57.251
"I'll have you in chunks."

54:57.959 --> 54:59.167
(laughs)

55:58.084 --> 56:00.126
(sirens)

56:51.042 --> 56:52.959
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>This is the Margate train.</i>

56:53.084 --> 56:55.751
<i>Stopping at Stratford, Ebbsfleet,</i>

56:55.876 --> 56:57.084
<i>Canterbury West,</i>

56:57.209 --> 56:59.667
<i>and terminating at Margate.</i>

57:00.834 --> 57:03.959
They were obviously highly intelligent
with great strength and stamina.

57:04.084 --> 57:05.376
A highly organised outfit.

57:05.501 --> 57:07.751
- So not English in other words?
- Next?

57:08.917 --> 57:10.792
<i>The overall value of the haul
may never be known</i>

57:10.917 --> 57:14.751
<i>but early reports put it
as high as 300 million pounds.</i>

57:14.876 --> 57:18.334
<i>That would make it the biggest robbery
in British criminal history.</i>

57:18.917 --> 57:21.209
<i>This is a very
highly sophisticated robbery.</i>

57:21.334 --> 57:24.042
<i>Professional team. There aren't
that many about nowadays.</i>

57:24.167 --> 57:25.542
<i>So it will narrow the field down</i>

57:25.667 --> 57:29.667
<i>from the intelligence that the Flying
Squad will have back at Scotland Yard.</i>

57:29.792 --> 57:33.917
REPORTER: <i>Is the crime a metaphor for the
decline of British ingenuity and skill?</i>

57:34.042 --> 57:37.167
<i>Do we now need to import
not only our plumbers,</i>

57:37.292 --> 57:40.542
<i>IT technicians, doctors, nurses
and footballers</i>

57:40.667 --> 57:42.584
<i>but our criminals as well?</i>

57:43.459 --> 57:44.959
That's Albanians.

57:45.084 --> 57:48.334
<i>My own speculation is that
unless they're complete idiots,</i>

57:48.459 --> 57:50.376
<i>the jewels must have
already left the country.</i>

57:51.084 --> 57:54.209
<i>And I say this just because
the UK market's not big enough</i>

57:54.334 --> 57:57.167
<i>to absorb such a vast quantity
of stolen gems.</i>

57:57.334 --> 57:58.709
<i>They could never sell them.</i>

57:58.834 --> 58:01.626
REPORTER: <i>Police have confirmed there
was a substantial amount of gold bullion</i>

58:01.751 --> 58:03.251
<i>stored in the vault</i>

58:03.376 --> 58:05.459
<i>along with hundreds of these brifkas.</i>

58:05.792 --> 58:10.667
<i>One of these could be worth
as much as five million pounds.</i>

58:32.459 --> 58:33.876
Don't open them.

58:34.001 --> 58:36.792
Look, the envelope tells you the value.

58:38.501 --> 58:43.459
Oh, yeah, we'll count the envelopes
and divide 'em up equally.

58:43.584 --> 58:46.792
Billy, he'll take the heavy stuff
away to store,

58:46.917 --> 58:50.626
and when we've got somebody
to evaluate everything,

58:50.751 --> 58:52.876
he'll bring it all back. Won't you, son?

58:53.001 --> 58:55.126
Yes, all right, lads. I'll do that, yeah.

58:55.251 --> 58:56.292
Yeah, good man.

58:56.417 --> 58:58.001
BASIL:
Sorry.

58:58.126 --> 59:00.084
What if I don't trust him
to bring it back?

59:00.209 --> 59:01.959
Sorry, you might not have a choice, mate.

59:02.084 --> 59:04.292
Sorry, but I haven't spent my life
robbing banks

59:04.417 --> 59:06.417
to be left with no fucking choice.

59:06.542 --> 59:07.834
Settle down, Terence.

59:07.959 --> 59:09.709
Slow and steady wins the race.

59:09.834 --> 59:13.417
Yeah, you're right, Ken. I mean,
all that rushing and bing-bonging about.

59:13.542 --> 59:15.751
- I mean, it's not our style, is it, mate?
- (chuckles)

59:15.876 --> 59:17.751
Not remotely, Daniel.

59:17.876 --> 59:19.626
Not remotely.

59:20.584 --> 59:22.667
Here you are, one for you, Ken.

59:23.001 --> 59:24.959
One for Terry, one for me,

59:25.084 --> 59:27.126
one for Terry, one for me.

59:27.251 --> 59:30.001
Just a minute, it needs to be
an equal split, don't you think?

59:30.959 --> 59:32.417
One for me.

59:32.542 --> 59:34.667
- No.
- One for Terry.

59:34.792 --> 59:37.292
Danny, it needs to be equal,
don't you think?

59:37.417 --> 59:40.376
Yeah, look. I'll get you in a minute, son.
Don't worry about it.

59:40.501 --> 59:42.626
- I mean, I'm just saying that we need...
- Me...

59:43.417 --> 59:45.626
We need to work out exactly what's here

59:45.751 --> 59:48.584
and then we need to divide it
exactly by five.

59:50.084 --> 59:51.459
Absolutely, son.

59:51.876 --> 59:56.376
When the dust settles, we'll get
round a smelter and do the gold.

59:56.501 --> 59:59.251
No, no. I'm not talking about the gold,
Kenny. I'm talk...

59:59.376 --> 01:00:01.001
all this.

01:00:01.126 --> 01:00:02.417
I mean, look at it.

01:00:03.126 --> 01:00:04.751
I mean, where do we even start?

01:00:05.334 --> 01:00:07.417
How do we know what's here?
We hav...

01:00:07.542 --> 01:00:09.626
No, hold on a second.

01:00:11.334 --> 01:00:12.876
We have to get hold of Brian.

01:00:14.042 --> 01:00:17.334
This was his idea. Technically
this is his intellectual property.

01:00:17.876 --> 01:00:20.751
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah. No, we need to get hold of Brian

01:00:20.876 --> 01:00:22.959
and bring him back here,
give him his share.

01:00:23.084 --> 01:00:24.709
Or give him your share. How's that sound?

01:00:24.834 --> 01:00:26.084
(Dan laughs)

01:00:27.459 --> 01:00:29.876
Well, that sounds like
a bit of a shafting.

01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:32.251
I think you like a bit of a shafting,
don't you, son?

01:00:32.376 --> 01:00:33.417
What?

01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:35.042
- No.
- (laughs)

01:00:35.167 --> 01:00:37.209
Why would I like that?

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:41.834
Well, you like wearing funny clothes.
Silly hats and fucking wigs. You do.

01:00:41.959 --> 01:00:44.001
If dressing up's your thing, I don't mind.

01:00:44.126 --> 01:00:45.876
- I don't mind.
- But if that's what you like,

01:00:46.001 --> 01:00:49.959
why don't you take this fucking cheap,
nasty jewellery off our hands?

01:00:50.084 --> 01:00:52.167
Put it in your dressing-up box,
find a use for it.

01:00:52.292 --> 01:00:53.792
And leave the grown-up stuff with us.

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:55.709
Well, hold on a second. I got you in.

01:00:56.667 --> 01:00:59.709
Now, I handled the keys and the alarms.
You wouldn't have been able to do

01:00:59.834 --> 01:01:02.001
- any of this without me.
- You invited us.

01:01:02.584 --> 01:01:04.917
No, look,
I was hired to facilitate a burglary.

01:01:05.042 --> 01:01:06.709
A burglary?

01:01:06.834 --> 01:01:08.792
- I don't think it was a burglary.
- No.

01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:10.292
- I thought it was a party.
- Yeah.

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:12.126
A what d'you call it,
a rave, weren't it?

01:01:12.251 --> 01:01:15.001
Yeah, a rave. You know,
you were there with the keys.

01:01:15.126 --> 01:01:17.459
We turned up, livened things up a bit.

01:01:17.584 --> 01:01:20.251
You know, if things went wrong,
well, that's down to you.

01:01:20.376 --> 01:01:22.626
That's your responsibility.

01:01:22.751 --> 01:01:25.959
You shouldn't have let us in
in the fucking first place.

01:01:26.667 --> 01:01:29.042
Go on, off you go.

01:01:29.167 --> 01:01:31.792
- Jog on.
- Go on, run along.

01:01:31.917 --> 01:01:34.834
We'll give you a tinkle
when it's all divvied up.

01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:38.501
(dog whines)

01:01:38.626 --> 01:01:42.084
Steady on, old son. That's French oak.

01:01:44.709 --> 01:01:46.292
Look, Terence,

01:01:46.417 --> 01:01:50.167
he, he's got about
80 grand in front of him.

01:01:50.292 --> 01:01:53.626
Give him his whack.
He'll forget about it by tomorrow.

01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:55.334
He's right, Tel.

01:01:57.584 --> 01:01:59.292
How's that sound, son?

01:02:38.792 --> 01:02:41.501
Right, that's one for Terry,
and one for me.

01:02:44.376 --> 01:02:46.459
No, no, no.

01:02:47.167 --> 01:02:49.834
You'll get your drink
when you bring our things back.

in a cruddy seaside town

01:07:29.459 --> 01:07:31.667
bickering over crumbs.

01:07:34.042 --> 01:07:35.751
Tell you what I think.

01:07:36.042 --> 01:07:39.876
I think they don't know what they've got.
They don't know what it's worth,

01:07:40.001 --> 01:07:43.042
how to fence it,
and they've no idea what to do about it.

01:07:43.167 --> 01:07:45.251
Those fucking dingbats!

01:07:45.501 --> 01:07:47.376
They've fucked this all up.

01:07:48.084 --> 01:07:49.584
You know what this means?

01:07:50.584 --> 01:07:54.542
This means that I am the only one
who will get nothing.

01:07:58.626 --> 01:07:59.917
Still,

01:08:01.167 --> 01:08:03.751
might as well be
hung for a sheep as a lamb.

01:08:04.876 --> 01:08:06.251
What does that mean?

01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:08.334
I want what is mine.

01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:10.084
Yeah, so do I.

01:08:10.542 --> 01:08:13.792
I want that tom
before it's returned to sender.

01:08:14.459 --> 01:08:16.542
Run like the wind, you said.

01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:19.459
- Eh? Know when to quit.
- Not now.

01:08:19.584 --> 01:08:21.667
Look where it's got us.

01:08:21.917 --> 01:08:25.251
- We've nothing to lose now.
- Yeah, I suppose you're right.

01:08:25.376 --> 01:08:28.042
I am gonna get what is due to me.

what Brian doesn't comprehend, Billy,

01:10:42.334 --> 01:10:45.709
is that I've actually saved our necks.

01:10:46.209 --> 01:10:48.376
- It's all about the fence.
- Well, he says it himself,

01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:50.917
getting rid of it, that's the hard part.

01:10:51.042 --> 01:10:52.917
(chuckles) Delegating.

01:10:53.042 --> 01:10:56.876
You see, Brian, he has to be the boss.

01:10:57.626 --> 01:11:01.334
Has to be the Guv.
But he's lost his desire, Billy.

01:11:01.459 --> 01:11:03.084
He doesn't have the heart no more.

01:11:03.209 --> 01:11:05.626
- All the more for us.
- (chuckling)

01:11:05.751 --> 01:11:08.876
I bet... I mean...
Sorry to say this, Billy, old fruit,

01:11:09.209 --> 01:11:10.876
but you've hit the nail on the head there.

01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:13.042
Well, I think so.

01:11:13.167 --> 01:11:14.751
You're the Guv now.

01:11:14.876 --> 01:11:16.876
Tell you what, Billy.

01:11:17.001 --> 01:11:19.042
- I reckon I must be.
- Yeah.

01:11:21.334 --> 01:11:23.417
- (bubbling)
- Ooh.

01:11:24.792 --> 01:11:26.042
Better out than in.

01:11:26.167 --> 01:11:27.334
(both laugh)

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:47.334
- There you go, son.
- Cheers, Dan.

01:11:49.001 --> 01:11:50.209
Kenny.

01:11:50.334 --> 01:11:52.834
He's a thick, wombat-headed old cunt.

01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:54.834
Now, what's he up to, Tel?

01:11:55.084 --> 01:11:56.376
He's devious.

01:11:56.501 --> 01:11:58.459
Devious, yeah.
That's exactly what he is.

01:11:58.584 --> 01:12:00.167
He's so fucking two-faced.

01:12:00.292 --> 01:12:01.292
Yeah, he's two-faced.

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:03.126
I hate him, Dan. Drives me mad.

01:12:03.251 --> 01:12:04.626
I fucking hate him too.

01:12:04.751 --> 01:12:05.959

01:12:06.084 --> 01:12:08.417
- Hello, Ken.
- Hello, Kenny, old son.

01:12:08.542 --> 01:12:10.376
Yeah, who's getting them in?

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.876
Yeah, I'll get you a drink.
What you want?

01:12:13.501 --> 01:12:15.042
Er, a drop of vodka.

01:12:15.167 --> 01:12:16.501
- Double?
- Why not?

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:38.167
(click of camera)

01:13:28.042 --> 01:13:29.376
What were you thinking, Ken?

01:13:29.959 --> 01:13:31.251
Well, I wasn't thinking.

01:13:31.376 --> 01:13:33.959
- You went behind our backs.
- Yeah, you did.

01:13:35.667 --> 01:13:36.959
Talking to Billy.

01:13:37.292 --> 01:13:40.501
Because Brian left us in the lurch, Terry.

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:43.334
He's a very selfish,
self-serving man is Brian.

01:13:43.459 --> 01:13:45.376
I do not trust him one little bit.

01:13:45.876 --> 01:13:48.251
Why don't you tell him
to his fucking face, then?

01:13:49.917 --> 01:13:51.542
He'll take it coming from you.

01:13:52.126 --> 01:13:53.542
I'm going to.

01:13:53.667 --> 01:13:55.084
Don't you worry.

01:13:55.209 --> 01:13:58.209
I'll have it out with him
the first fucking chance I get.

01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:02.542
- All right?
- Yeah, all right.

01:14:02.667 --> 01:14:04.167
D'you want a top-up, Ken?

01:14:04.292 --> 01:14:05.834
No, I'm all right.

01:14:51.667 --> 01:14:52.751
(front door shuts)

01:14:52.876 --> 01:14:54.709
(mutters)

01:14:55.542 --> 01:14:57.626
(hums)

01:15:02.126 --> 01:15:04.584
Come on, sweetie.
It's not bedtime yet, Tallulah.

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:05.834
(dog whines)

01:15:05.959 --> 01:15:08.042
(he continues humming)

01:15:10.167 --> 01:15:12.251
Christ.

01:15:14.959 --> 01:15:17.709
- Ooh. Fucking hell.
- Hello, Ken.

01:15:19.209 --> 01:15:20.751
You're out late.

01:15:21.167 --> 01:15:23.626
What're you sitting in the dark for,
Brian?

01:15:24.042 --> 01:15:25.917
Frightened me to death.

01:15:26.542 --> 01:15:28.626
I prefer the dark.

01:15:28.959 --> 01:15:31.792
People are frightened in the dark.
Makes them wanna talk.

01:15:34.917 --> 01:15:37.001
Brian.

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:40.584
- Brian.
- Yeah?

01:15:41.584 --> 01:15:45.626
The last thing I want is to upset you,
old son.

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:48.292
We need you back in the fold.

01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:50.792
I know you do.

01:15:52.292 --> 01:15:54.751
Basil said you hadn't counted it yet.

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:57.126
And you believed him?

01:15:57.251 --> 01:15:59.834
- What do you mean?
- Well, he got a drink.

01:15:59.959 --> 01:16:02.334
He went through a hole.
And he got a drink.

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:04.334
He got a drink?

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:08.042
Yeah, he got a ton and he had gold.

01:16:08.626 --> 01:16:09.876
Gold?

01:16:10.876 --> 01:16:12.501
He never told me he had gold.

01:16:12.626 --> 01:16:15.126
Yeah, Barney Rubble, that boy.

01:16:16.376 --> 01:16:18.417
What about the rest of the stuff?

01:16:18.542 --> 01:16:20.376
Well, you see, Brian,

01:16:20.501 --> 01:16:24.251
I've lodged the heavy stuff with Billy,

01:16:24.376 --> 01:16:25.751
just while the heat's on.

01:16:25.876 --> 01:16:27.876
I warned you about Billy.

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.251
You did, Brian. You did.

01:16:30.376 --> 01:16:32.042
But I've had it out with him.

01:16:32.167 --> 01:16:34.834
I've told him it is nothing to do with him

01:16:34.959 --> 01:16:37.417
and to keep his nose out of it.

01:16:37.917 --> 01:16:40.042
What about the other stuff?

01:16:40.167 --> 01:16:43.584
Yeah, well, he's very naughty is Terry.

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:46.167
Very, what's the word?

01:16:47.417 --> 01:16:49.667
Very duplicitous.

01:16:50.834 --> 01:16:52.542
So, we all took a bit to look after.

01:16:52.667 --> 01:16:55.667
We're gonna bring it all back
and get round the smelter.

01:16:58.251 --> 01:17:02.459
Danny and Terry, they're staunch?

01:17:03.417 --> 01:17:05.167
Danny, good as gold.

01:17:05.292 --> 01:17:08.042
Good as gold. But if only

01:17:08.167 --> 01:17:10.376
I could say the same for Terry.

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:14.709
You see, he's so unpredictable, Brian.

01:17:14.834 --> 01:17:19.292
I mean, he's a bit of a fucking old
psychopath is Terry, sometimes.

01:17:19.417 --> 01:17:22.542
- If you're asking me.
- I go back a long way with Terry.

01:17:24.751 --> 01:17:30.501
Which is why I think Danny,
he's probably the trouble-maker.

01:17:30.834 --> 01:17:33.084
You know, if you're asking me.

01:17:33.209 --> 01:17:35.292
I am fucking asking you.

01:17:36.334 --> 01:17:39.792
I can only tell it like I see it.

01:17:41.667 --> 01:17:43.751
Not as it is.

01:17:45.751 --> 01:17:48.042
That's it. Look behind you.

01:17:48.167 --> 01:17:49.792
And roll and...

01:17:49.917 --> 01:17:51.417
Thanks, Grandpa.

01:17:51.542 --> 01:17:54.876
Yeah, he's a very two-faced,
very weak man.

01:17:55.376 --> 01:17:58.334
Now it suits him to stroll back in,

01:17:58.459 --> 01:18:00.667
he don't care whose feelings he hurts.

01:18:01.834 --> 01:18:03.501
Here we go, stretch those feet.

01:18:03.626 --> 01:18:05.167
It does hurt my feelings

01:18:05.292 --> 01:18:07.334
to hear all this, Ken,
to be honest with ya.

01:18:07.626 --> 01:18:11.084
Cos when I was a lad, Brian
was someone I genuinely looked up to.

01:18:11.209 --> 01:18:12.959
D'you know what I'm saying?

01:18:13.084 --> 01:18:15.709
It's just so disappointing
when people stoop to backstabbing.

01:18:15.834 --> 01:18:17.584
Well, he doesn't have the passion no more.

01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:19.626
You and me, Terence,
we still have the passion.

01:18:19.751 --> 01:18:21.292
Crime is about passion.

01:18:22.501 --> 01:18:23.959
Hold on.

01:18:24.084 --> 01:18:25.667
Is that Frankie the Fence?

01:18:25.792 --> 01:18:27.501
Yeah, his daughter's in the class an' all.

01:18:27.626 --> 01:18:30.084
I thought we could have a word
while we're here.

01:18:30.209 --> 01:18:31.501
Just don't tell Brian.

01:18:31.626 --> 01:18:34.834
Nah, he'll be ringing up next.

01:18:34.959 --> 01:18:37.209
Wanting to meet us, see the loot.

01:18:38.126 --> 01:18:41.251
- Mark my words.
- Yeah, not on your fucking life, son.

01:18:42.501 --> 01:18:44.334
I won't even answer the phone.

01:18:44.917 --> 01:18:46.251
That's it.

01:18:46.376 --> 01:18:48.251
- Little steps.
- (mobile rings)

01:18:48.376 --> 01:18:50.126
Hello, Frankie, how are ya?

01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:56.001
Brian. Me old mucker.

01:18:56.126 --> 01:18:58.542
<i>It's time to open the fucking kimono, Ken.</i>

01:18:59.209 --> 01:19:00.834
<i>Tell the others I wanna meet.</i>

01:19:00.959 --> 01:19:02.001
<i>Tonight.</i>

01:19:02.126 --> 01:19:04.084
<i>I'm gonna sort this mess out.</i>

01:19:29.126 --> 01:19:30.251
(bleep)

01:19:31.959 --> 01:19:33.292
(bleep)

01:19:48.584 --> 01:19:52.334
Try not to be distracted by a perfectly
ordinary woman with a biro.

01:19:53.042 --> 01:19:54.834
And focus on the job in hand.

01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:59.001
Now,

01:20:00.167 --> 01:20:01.709
let's talk about Basil.

01:20:01.834 --> 01:20:03.376
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:20:03.501 --> 01:20:05.959
How much did he really walk off with, eh?

01:20:06.417 --> 01:20:10.709
Well, you know, like I said, Brian,
we gave him a drink.

01:20:11.459 --> 01:20:13.542
You said gold.

01:20:14.292 --> 01:20:17.167
How much really? Hm?

01:20:22.667 --> 01:20:23.792
Danny?

01:20:24.292 --> 01:20:26.084
What, you wanna know the exact amount?

01:20:27.334 --> 01:20:29.792
He never said anything to me about gold.

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:32.584
Oh, and you believe him?

01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:34.376
You trust him before you trust us?

01:20:34.501 --> 01:20:36.126
Is that what you're fucking saying?

01:20:46.959 --> 01:20:49.959
So, what's Billy got?

01:20:50.917 --> 01:20:56.209
Oh, I'm having a fucking nightmare
with old Billy, Brian.

01:20:56.667 --> 01:20:59.584
To be honest, he's proving
very difficult to work with.

01:20:59.709 --> 01:21:01.459
Very difficult indeed.

01:21:01.584 --> 01:21:02.917
What's the matter with him?

01:21:03.042 --> 01:21:06.751
Well, half the trouble, Brian,
is that Billy is incontinent.

01:21:06.876 --> 01:21:10.001
I'll be incontinent
if this goes on much longer.

01:21:10.126 --> 01:21:14.126
If he gets pinched, he's gonna say he's
got disabilities and they might not look.

01:21:14.251 --> 01:21:15.876
"It wasn't us, Officer.

01:21:16.001 --> 01:21:17.501
We're not capable."

01:21:18.334 --> 01:21:21.042
Bunch of harmless old raspberries
in the rub-a-dub.

01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:23.001
Who's gonna suspect us of being crooks?

01:21:23.126 --> 01:21:24.917
All the other fucking crooks for starters.

01:21:25.042 --> 01:21:26.917
We've stolen their pensions.

01:21:27.042 --> 01:21:29.917
So that's how they see us, is it?
The Lavender Hill Mob?

01:21:30.584 --> 01:21:33.876
A load of cuddly old crooks,
just having a laugh?

01:21:36.001 --> 01:21:38.084
What are you gonna say in the dock?

01:21:38.209 --> 01:21:40.834
"Oh, I've had two hip replacements.

01:21:40.959 --> 01:21:42.751
I've got diabetes.

01:21:42.876 --> 01:21:44.584
We were confused."

01:21:45.251 --> 01:21:47.834
You think they won't put you in jail
in case you suffer?

01:21:49.334 --> 01:21:51.417
They want you to suffer.

01:21:52.084 --> 01:21:54.876
- You should be proud of us.
- I'm not fucking proud.

01:21:55.001 --> 01:21:56.626
You could have been famous, Brian.

01:21:56.751 --> 01:21:59.001
I don't wanna be fucking famous.

01:22:00.542 --> 01:22:01.792
<i>Just get hold of Billy Lincoln.</i>

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.334
<i>When you've made the call,
get it all together,</i>

01:22:04.459 --> 01:22:07.417
<i>we'll meet in my garage,
chop it up, get out.</i>

01:22:12.959 --> 01:22:15.042
Dinner's on me.

01:22:19.084 --> 01:22:21.167
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:22:21.584 --> 01:22:23.917
Here you go.

01:22:25.417 --> 01:22:27.917
No problemo, Brian,
we'll just pop round your garage,

01:22:28.042 --> 01:22:31.001
give you all our sparkly stuff
and you can add it to your collection.

01:22:31.126 --> 01:22:32.792
It's disrespectful, Terence.

01:22:32.917 --> 01:22:35.542
His oldest friends and he treats us
like fucking navvies.

01:22:35.667 --> 01:22:37.459
He's getting a bit saucy, I'm telling ya.

01:22:37.584 --> 01:22:39.292
He needs a fucking slap.

01:22:39.417 --> 01:22:41.126
We're playing by my rules now, Danny boy.

01:22:41.251 --> 01:22:43.001
Ken. Get hold of Billy.

01:22:43.126 --> 01:22:45.251
We'll meet in the car park,
get the heavy stuff back.

01:22:45.376 --> 01:22:47.292
Give him the arse,
tell him to fuck off proper,

01:22:47.417 --> 01:22:49.001
and we'll get round the smelter.

01:22:49.126 --> 01:22:51.459
- What, in the fucking car park?
- I'll show you where, Dan.

01:22:51.584 --> 01:22:52.834
Don't worry your pretty little head.

01:22:53.209 --> 01:22:54.542
<i>I'll pick you up in the morning.</i>

01:22:54.667 --> 01:22:57.209
<i>Bring everything you've got.
We'll put it on the table.</i>

01:22:58.126 --> 01:22:59.542
And you, Ken.

01:22:59.667 --> 01:23:00.917
Look at me, Ken.

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:02.501
Look at me, Ken.

01:23:03.292 --> 01:23:05.709
No squirrelling it away for a rainy day,
eh?

01:23:07.292 --> 01:23:08.792
Or you know what'll happen.

01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:16.792
(mobile rings)

01:23:24.751 --> 01:23:25.792
Hi, Brian.

01:23:25.917 --> 01:23:28.917
I just treated
those old bastards to dinner.

01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:34.084
And they told me
that you got your whack after all.

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:36.209
Well, they would say that,
wouldn't they?

01:23:40.876 --> 01:23:42.959
What else didn't you tell me?

01:23:47.084 --> 01:23:50.209
Why would I come all the way to Margate
if I was bullshitting you?

01:23:50.334 --> 01:23:53.001
- Because you're greedy.
- They're lying, Brian.

01:23:53.667 --> 01:23:54.917
<i>I know they are,</i>

01:23:55.042 --> 01:23:59.334
<i>and I also know that those boxes
I gave you were all opened.</i>

01:24:00.917 --> 01:24:05.209
I warned you what those crooks
would do if you pulled this off.

01:24:06.001 --> 01:24:10.376
<i>You better pray they find you
before I fucking do.</i>

01:24:10.501 --> 01:24:11.959
(Brian hangs up)

01:27:19.542 --> 01:27:22.126
You gonna be all right with the injections
and everything?

01:27:22.251 --> 01:27:23.751
Got someone to do it in your bum?

01:27:23.876 --> 01:27:25.334
Who can I get to do it in my bum?

01:27:25.459 --> 01:27:27.917
- Kenny'll understand.
- Kenny's busy.

01:27:28.042 --> 01:27:29.417
What's he up to?

01:27:29.542 --> 01:27:33.126
Reckons he's done some silly burglary,
don't he? Over Easter or something.

01:27:33.251 --> 01:27:35.959
Well, he's bored, ain't he?
At his age he's got nothing else to do.

01:27:37.001 --> 01:27:39.459
Keeps trying to get me involved.
Mad bastard.

01:27:39.584 --> 01:27:42.959
You keep away from that Kenneth. He's
up to something. He'll lead you astray.

01:27:43.084 --> 01:27:45.001
Can I borrow your house while you're away?

01:27:45.917 --> 01:27:47.376
What are you up to?

01:27:47.667 --> 01:27:49.084
I'm your father.

01:27:51.209 --> 01:27:53.292
I'll pay ya.

01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:12.709
- Is that it?
- There you go. One smelter.

01:28:12.834 --> 01:28:14.167
All right, Dan?

01:28:14.292 --> 01:28:16.334
Well, seeing I'm the fucking Joey
on the firm.

01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:18.626
Fuck's sake.

01:28:18.751 --> 01:28:20.876
- There you go.
- Right, cheers.

01:28:22.626 --> 01:28:24.917
Frankie, I wanna show you something.
Come here.

01:28:25.709 --> 01:28:27.084
Have a look at that.

01:28:27.584 --> 01:28:29.084
What's it say?

01:28:29.584 --> 01:28:32.751
It says it's small,
yellow and highly flawed.

01:28:34.001 --> 01:28:35.501
What's it worth?

01:28:35.626 --> 01:28:36.876
Nah, nothing, mate.

01:28:37.917 --> 01:28:40.251
Maybe come back
when you're serious, yeah?

01:28:40.376 --> 01:28:41.959
Fuck.

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:44.751
Well, that's another fucker that knows.

01:28:45.376 --> 01:28:46.959
You didn't tell him anything, did ya?

01:28:47.084 --> 01:28:51.251
- What kind of arsehole d'you take me for?
- Just get in the fucking car and drive.

01:28:51.376 --> 01:28:53.376
- Someone's tired.
- Fuck off.

01:29:24.626 --> 01:29:27.792
TERRY: <i>I blame Brian for all these
negative feelings I've been having.</i>

01:29:28.459 --> 01:29:31.626
Have you got negative feelings,
then, have you, Terence?

01:29:31.751 --> 01:29:33.792
Oh, we all do, don't we?

01:29:33.917 --> 01:29:35.751
The fear.

01:29:35.876 --> 01:29:38.334
The paranoia and the loneliness and that.

01:29:39.042 --> 01:29:41.751
Nah, he's insecure.

01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:47.667
He's a very insecure,
undependable human being.

01:29:48.667 --> 01:29:50.417
I'm not insecure myself.

01:29:50.542 --> 01:29:53.667
But I do wonder why the whole
entire fucking world is our enemy

01:29:53.792 --> 01:29:55.917
and against us all the fucking time.

01:29:56.042 --> 01:29:57.167
Sometimes.

01:30:05.876 --> 01:30:07.959
Oh, here he comes.

01:30:08.334 --> 01:30:10.292
The dog's a better driver than he is.

01:30:13.084 --> 01:30:14.959
Fuck me, it's Lewis Hamilton, ain't it?

01:30:23.667 --> 01:30:25.376
<i>Terry Perkins is a convicted armed robber</i>

01:30:25.501 --> 01:30:27.292
<i>and a bit of a sadist
when he wants to be.</i>

01:30:27.417 --> 01:30:30.209
<i>Collins has a slightly bigger brain
but he's had two hip replacements,</i>

01:30:30.334 --> 01:30:31.751
<i>so he's not going anywhere in a hurry.</i>

01:30:31.876 --> 01:30:34.042
But be very careful of Danny Jones.

01:30:34.167 --> 01:30:36.751
Previous for resisting arrest
and always happy to mix it up

01:30:36.876 --> 01:30:38.667
unless he's completely outnumbered.

01:30:43.542 --> 01:30:45.334
Hello, mate. (chuckles)

01:30:45.459 --> 01:30:47.251
How are you? Let's have a drink, then.

01:30:47.376 --> 01:30:50.292
There are CCTV cameras in pubs now, Billy.

01:30:50.417 --> 01:30:51.542
Can't be too careful.

01:30:51.667 --> 01:30:53.167
Look, there's one up there, innit?

01:30:53.292 --> 01:30:54.876
<i>Your eyesight's better than mine.</i>

01:30:55.001 --> 01:30:56.834
<i>- Shit, yeah, let's get on with it.
- Right.</i>

01:30:56.959 --> 01:30:59.376
The real supremo is Brian Reader.

01:31:00.126 --> 01:31:01.667
He may seem like a sad old man

01:31:01.792 --> 01:31:04.667
but he's capable of severe nastiness
when he's cornered.

01:31:05.376 --> 01:31:08.167
<i>He's implicated
in the murder of a police officer.</i>

01:31:09.792 --> 01:31:11.876
<i>He doesn't like us.</i>

01:31:13.251 --> 01:31:15.334
<i>And we don't like him.</i>

01:31:16.834 --> 01:31:18.334
There you go.

01:31:18.459 --> 01:31:20.417
Yeah, there you go. Right.

01:31:20.542 --> 01:31:21.917
- All right, mate.
- See you, Billy.

01:31:22.042 --> 01:31:23.876
I'm gonna have a pint in here, all right?

01:31:24.209 --> 01:31:26.292
DAN:
<i>It's the blind leading the deaf.</i>

01:31:27.126 --> 01:31:29.376
- Where's he going?
- He's going for a drink.

01:31:29.501 --> 01:31:32.126
- And a piss.
- Not necessarily in that order.

01:31:32.251 --> 01:31:33.959
(Dan laughs)

01:31:35.667 --> 01:31:38.042
What a soppy old cunt.

01:31:38.792 --> 01:31:42.126
Banging about in his nutty white jam jar

01:31:42.917 --> 01:31:46.084
with that stupid poncey dog.

01:31:47.751 --> 01:31:50.334
Yeah, you treacherous pair of slags.

01:31:51.084 --> 01:31:53.126
I've got you by the cobblers now.

01:31:55.667 --> 01:31:58.167
<i>Surveillance is all over them.
Armed Response are ready.</i>

01:31:58.292 --> 01:32:00.417
<i>I just need to catch them red-handed.</i>

01:32:35.292 --> 01:32:37.376
Yours feels a bit light.

01:32:38.209 --> 01:32:39.626
So does yours.

01:32:41.626 --> 01:32:43.251
How do I know you haven't switched 'em?

01:32:43.376 --> 01:32:46.376
Taken all the good big ones out
and left the little yellow ones in?

01:32:46.792 --> 01:32:48.417
How do I know you ain't?

01:32:53.751 --> 01:32:55.834
Where the fuck's Kenny?

01:33:37.542 --> 01:33:38.876
(clatters)

01:33:42.334 --> 01:33:43.792
(whines)

01:33:47.251 --> 01:33:48.376
(doorbell)

01:33:56.001 --> 01:33:58.167
Here you are.

01:34:01.667 --> 01:34:03.751
Took your fucking time, Ken.

01:34:03.876 --> 01:34:05.459
Where the fuck you been?

01:34:06.542 --> 01:34:08.626
I haven't had a piss since Sunday.

01:34:11.834 --> 01:34:13.917
- Fucking old cunt!
- A bit fucking light.

01:34:14.042 --> 01:34:15.959
Are they? Is this everything?

01:34:16.876 --> 01:34:18.834
Where's all the big ones?

01:34:18.959 --> 01:34:21.834
Where's the fucking big 'uns?
Where's the big 'uns?

01:34:23.042 --> 01:34:26.751
- I reckon he's switched 'em.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:34:26.876 --> 01:34:29.042
I mean, what a cheek. What a cheek.

01:34:29.167 --> 01:34:31.876
And severe fucking badness.

01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:34.251
Such unprof...

01:34:34.876 --> 01:34:36.917
Unprofessionalism.

01:34:37.042 --> 01:34:38.334
Fuck!

01:34:39.584 --> 01:34:41.334
You fucking old thief.

01:34:41.459 --> 01:34:44.126
You fucker. You fucker.

01:34:50.001 --> 01:34:51.126
What's wrong?

01:34:53.417 --> 01:34:54.917
<i>This is Brian's doing.</i>

01:34:55.209 --> 01:34:57.792
He's made us all fucking paranoid.

01:34:57.917 --> 01:35:02.209
That man, he's so...
He's so manipulative.

01:35:13.209 --> 01:35:15.126
Let's have a look, shall we?

01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:16.917
Have a look at the gold.

01:35:18.084 --> 01:35:20.167
See what's left.

01:35:21.417 --> 01:35:22.626
Yeah?

01:35:22.751 --> 01:35:24.834
What you fucking done with it?

01:35:28.542 --> 01:35:30.626
- (mobile rings)
- Er...

01:35:31.084 --> 01:35:33.417
H-Hold on, Danny.

01:35:36.626 --> 01:35:39.709
What the fucking fuck are you up to?

01:35:40.084 --> 01:35:43.001
The place is crawling with cozzers.

01:35:43.126 --> 01:35:47.084
- Oh, fuck. He saw us.
- What? You think we stitched you up?

01:35:47.292 --> 01:35:49.959
No. I think
you were waiting for me to die.

01:35:50.084 --> 01:35:52.167
<i>- Put Terry on.</i>
- Yeah, here you are.

01:35:52.292 --> 01:35:54.126
Er, Terry. Terry.

01:35:55.334 --> 01:35:59.126
I'll be under the sod soon enough.
You know that.

01:36:00.959 --> 01:36:04.376
But I will be fucking waiting for you.

01:36:05.251 --> 01:36:07.417
And I can wait, Terry.

01:36:07.542 --> 01:36:09.292
You know I fucking can.

01:37:06.292 --> 01:37:07.959
Fuck. Get...

01:37:12.876 --> 01:37:14.417
- Go, go, go, go!
- Armed police!

01:37:14.751 --> 01:37:17.251
Armed police! Stay where you are!
Don't move!

01:37:17.376 --> 01:37:18.917
Stay where you are!

01:37:19.334 --> 01:37:20.709
Stay where you are!

01:37:23.084 --> 01:37:24.126
Armed police!

01:37:24.251 --> 01:37:26.667
Put your hands up. Now! Now!

01:37:26.792 --> 01:37:28.251
- Stay where you are.
- Stay still.

01:37:28.376 --> 01:37:32.001
Clear! Clear! Move! Move! Come on.

01:37:32.126 --> 01:37:34.626
- Get down.
- You fucking wanker, get down!

01:37:34.751 --> 01:37:36.626
- Get down!
- Get down now!

01:37:36.751 --> 01:37:38.417
- Turn around!
- Move! Come on!

01:37:38.542 --> 01:37:39.792
Move! Move!

01:37:39.917 --> 01:37:42.001
Don't even look at me.

01:37:42.334 --> 01:37:44.417
- Don't move.
- You're done now, Jonesy.

01:37:54.542 --> 01:37:56.626
Any chance of a cup of tea?

01:38:17.417 --> 01:38:19.459
Armed police! Show me your hands!

01:38:21.042 --> 01:38:23.667
Keep them in the air.
Walk slowly towards me.

01:38:26.792 --> 01:38:29.834
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

01:38:29.959 --> 01:38:34.251
if you do not mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

01:38:44.542 --> 01:38:45.792
Hands in front of you.

01:38:47.459 --> 01:38:50.542
- Hang on.
- Hang on a minute.

01:38:50.667 --> 01:38:52.126
Hey, take it easy, will you?

01:38:52.251 --> 01:38:54.084
Oh, God.

01:38:54.667 --> 01:38:57.876
I had nothing to do with this business,
you know?

01:38:58.376 --> 01:39:00.584
(dog barks)

01:39:09.126 --> 01:39:11.959
(barking and police radio)

01:39:32.001 --> 01:39:34.584
(dog barks)

01:40:24.584 --> 01:40:26.709
How old do you think I look, Ken?

01:40:26.834 --> 01:40:30.251
I mean, because, you know,
I don't think I'm that old.

01:40:30.376 --> 01:40:32.376
Well, I don't think I'm old.

01:40:32.501 --> 01:40:35.501
No-one thinks they're old. Not even
old people think they're old.

01:40:36.042 --> 01:40:40.084
The "old" business, it never works.
I mean, I've been trying it on for years.

01:40:40.209 --> 01:40:42.959
Yeah, you're in trouble if it backfires,
though.

01:40:43.084 --> 01:40:47.292
Yeah, when you're young,
they egg you on if you're bent.

01:40:48.584 --> 01:40:50.709
When you're old, they resent ya.

01:40:51.084 --> 01:40:54.167
The older you get, the more dangerous
you get as far as they're concerned.

01:40:54.292 --> 01:40:56.417
I feel 23 inside.

01:40:56.542 --> 01:40:58.626
You know, the thing that worries me
is that they...

01:40:58.751 --> 01:41:02.459
- Think you're young?
- Nah, they think I've still got a future.

01:41:02.584 --> 01:41:05.084
Well, that's the one thing
you don't wanna tell them.

01:41:05.209 --> 01:41:07.209
That you've got a future.

01:41:07.334 --> 01:41:09.334
None of us have got a future.

01:41:09.459 --> 01:41:10.917
That's the point.

01:41:11.042 --> 01:41:12.626
You just tell 'em you're dying.

01:41:12.751 --> 01:41:14.917
Not far off.

01:41:15.042 --> 01:41:17.042
(chuckles) I could work on my limp.

01:41:17.167 --> 01:41:19.334
- I've got Crohn's disease.
- Yeah, you know,

01:41:19.459 --> 01:41:21.167
there's diabetes, depression.

01:41:21.292 --> 01:41:23.542
Personality disorder's always a good one.

01:41:24.001 --> 01:41:25.542
Everybody, list your ailments.

01:41:25.667 --> 01:41:27.292
Get certificates.

01:41:27.417 --> 01:41:29.626
We want 'em to treat us gently.

01:41:29.751 --> 01:41:31.501
No, you fucking don't.

01:41:31.626 --> 01:41:33.917
- Why not?
- Because apart from anything else,

01:41:34.042 --> 01:41:36.167
it's too fucking patronising.

01:41:39.917 --> 01:41:41.167
- You ready?
- Yep.

01:41:42.251 --> 01:41:44.334
Let's go.

01:42:09.251 --> 01:42:11.501
What with all these fucking villains
running about,

01:42:11.626 --> 01:42:13.209
best place for us now is in the boob.

01:42:13.376 --> 01:42:14.917
No way.

01:42:15.042 --> 01:42:17.251
At my age I'll do anything to avoid jail.

01:42:17.376 --> 01:42:19.084
Well, at least you get
a decent cup of tea.

01:42:19.209 --> 01:42:21.626
Yeah, at least you can relax,
you know, put your feet up.

01:42:21.751 --> 01:42:23.376
See a doctor when you need one.

01:42:23.501 --> 01:42:25.709
No, no, I can't go through all that again.

01:42:25.834 --> 01:42:28.167
- My kids'll kill me.
- It's my mum I'm worried about.

01:42:28.292 --> 01:42:30.501
- She ain't getting any younger.
- Yeah, well,

01:42:30.626 --> 01:42:34.001
my Lyn'll be spinning in her grave
if I go back inside.

01:42:34.584 --> 01:42:36.584
- I promised her.
- Never told us that.
