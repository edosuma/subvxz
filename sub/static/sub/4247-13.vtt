WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:04.603
That's the first rule --
no families, no connections.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.538
I never really had
a family anyway.

00:06.540 --> 00:10.642
I'm more from this group
of people related by blood.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.378
Indiana --
middle of nowhere.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.113
She really liked
that tv channel

00:14.115 --> 00:15.781
Where you call in
and buy things --

00:15.783 --> 00:21.353
Fake porcelain dolls,
magic stain removers,

00:21.355 --> 00:24.156
Big pictures of puppies
wearing funny hats.

00:24.158 --> 00:27.126
He really liked drugs
and sex with underage girls.

00:27.128 --> 00:30.095
I had a sister, so...

00:30.097 --> 00:33.065
She's dead now.
She died. Anyway...

00:33.067 --> 00:36.268
Not having a family
makes you ripe, ready,

00:36.270 --> 00:40.406
A hunk of clay
waiting to be sculpted.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.541
No connections.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.610
No light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.046
No sun on the horizon.
Nothing to wish for.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.448
They could burn the wonderland
stamp on your brain,

00:49.450 --> 00:51.116
And no one would be the wiser,

00:51.118 --> 00:53.085
Because there's no one there
to miss you.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.154
You're now the property
of the United States government,

00:55.156 --> 00:57.356
Division b613.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.324
You come to work
at acme limited.

00:59.326 --> 01:02.194
You fake-sell fake paper,
and you run the world

01:02.196 --> 01:05.130
In a way that no one even
imagines exists in real life,

01:05.132 --> 01:09.134
And then, little by little,
you've been places...

01:09.136 --> 01:12.404
And you've done things,
and there's been so much blood.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.142
This becomes your home.

01:17.144 --> 01:19.611
This becomes your family.

01:19.613 --> 01:24.149
And you can't imagine
any other life.

01:24.151 --> 01:28.120
I-I don't think I understand.
The debate?

01:28.122 --> 01:30.722
Debate prep -- we're prepping
for the presidential debates,

01:30.724 --> 01:32.091
The big time.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.725
Langston versus reston
versus grant,

01:33.727 --> 01:35.627
A three-way,
heavyweight prize fight.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.197
We should discuss
confidentiality.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.832
Mr. Bergen,
it's just I'm not sure

01:39.834 --> 01:41.266
Why you've asked me
to come.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.435
To help sally --
debate prep.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.171
Anything she tells you
is confidential, right?

01:46.173 --> 01:48.574
Like preacher/sally
confidentiality or whatever.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.142
You took
some sort of vow.

01:50.144 --> 01:53.745
It's an honor to help
vice president langston

01:53.747 --> 01:55.180
In any way I can.
Good.

01:55.182 --> 01:57.416
I'm just not sure that I --
[ stammers ]

01:57.418 --> 01:59.351
Well, I'm not even
completely sure

01:59.353 --> 02:01.553
I understand
what "debate prep" means.

02:01.555 --> 02:04.590
You're close.
You're her spiritual advisor.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.391
Well, her family
has been worshipping

02:06.393 --> 02:08.160
At the good shepherd
baptist church

02:08.162 --> 02:09.595
Since before
the civil war.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.697
Okay, that's not
what I asked you, reverend.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.532
I know she's a member
of your church.

02:13.534 --> 02:16.135
I called you and put you
on a plane -- a private plane --

02:16.137 --> 02:18.170
Because apparently god's servant
won't fly coach,

02:18.172 --> 02:22.407
Reverend dale, does the
vice president listen to you,

02:22.409 --> 02:23.809
Come to you
for spiritual counsel,

02:23.811 --> 02:25.210
Or does she just,
you know,

02:25.212 --> 02:26.812
Throw a few coins
in your collection plate

02:26.814 --> 02:29.214
For the photo op whenever
she visits her home state?

02:29.216 --> 02:32.284
Mr. Bergen, please.
This is a very important
question, reverend. Think
before you answer.

02:32.286 --> 02:35.521
Are you an actual man of god who
can influence sally langston,

02:35.523 --> 02:37.322
Or are you a waste
of my time?

02:37.324 --> 02:39.658
I <i>am</i> a man of god.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.928
Wonderful. Then, welcome
to langston-for-president
debate prep.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.497
Sally: And where in hell
did <i>you</i> summon the audacity

02:45.499 --> 02:46.932
To accuse <i>me</i>
<i>of dirty politics</i>

02:46.934 --> 02:48.934
While you're the one
slathered in mud,

02:48.936 --> 02:50.936
Fornicating
with whatever slithers by

02:50.938 --> 02:53.939
While dining on your own filth
till you're too fat to stand?

02:53.941 --> 02:56.875
Time for the slaughter,
piggy, piggy!

02:56.877 --> 02:59.411
Time for the slaughter,
you filthy, cloven beast!

02:59.413 --> 03:02.181
I see the signs of the devil
branded into your flesh.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.282
We <i>all</i> see them.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.850
Time to serve your master.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.885
Time to make the bacon!

03:06.887 --> 03:09.621
Judgment is upon you,
and, on that day,

03:09.623 --> 03:10.789
You will no longer
roam the temple,

03:10.791 --> 03:17.563
For you will be frying
in the flames of hell...
She's all yours,
reverend. Fix her.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.732
...For you satanic master
to snack upon!

03:20.734 --> 03:22.267
Yum, yum, crispy piggy!

03:22.269 --> 03:27.372
Yum, yum!

03:27.374 --> 03:29.741
Mellie: The only way
to improve that standing

03:29.743 --> 03:32.411
And to keep our nation safe
is to replace you.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.547
And if it can't be me -- and
it <i>should</i> be me, of course --

03:35.549 --> 03:37.916
Then I'd rather see
governor reston
in the oval office.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.618
What a backhanded
compliment,

03:39.620 --> 03:41.253
Typical of the kind
of dysfunction

03:41.255 --> 03:42.754
We've witnessed
over the last three years

03:42.756 --> 03:44.590
With republicans
in power.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.425
Backhanded or not,
my intentions were sincere,

03:46.427 --> 03:47.726
I assure you,
governor reston.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.361
You want
to discuss decorum, sally?

03:49.363 --> 03:52.431
Let's discuss your choice
to split with my administration

03:52.433 --> 03:53.899
Without having the decency
to resign.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.768
Look, you're a hard worker,
and you're smart.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.704
It's why I chose you
to serve with me.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.973
But in the entire time
you've been in office,

04:00.975 --> 04:02.808
You have wasted
your intelligence

04:02.810 --> 04:05.944
And your efforts on one goal,
one task alone --

04:05.946 --> 04:07.512
Getting my job.

04:07.514 --> 04:08.847
That is preposterous.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.416
I have been
instrumental in --
let me finish.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.952
You can covet
and armchair-quarterback my job

04:13.954 --> 04:15.487
All the livelong day,

04:15.489 --> 04:18.790
But attacking my character
and quoting the bible

04:18.792 --> 04:22.261
Does not prepare you to help
struggling middle-class families

04:22.263 --> 04:24.663
Or to know when or how
or what it means

04:24.665 --> 04:26.965
To send our troops
into harm's way,

04:26.967 --> 04:30.302
To risk american lives
so that others in east sudan

04:30.304 --> 04:32.337
And in libya
and in the middle east

04:32.339 --> 04:36.675
Have a chance at peace
and prosperity and democracy.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.344
I am proud of what I've done
for this country.

04:39.346 --> 04:42.481
And while I am not proud
of my personal...
Liv,
he's killing it.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.983
He's back.
He's on fire.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.685
The phoenix from the ashes,
and you're missing it!

04:46.687 --> 04:50.889
Cyrus:
<i>Sally, it is not time.</i>
<i>[ cellphone chimes ]</i>

04:50.891 --> 04:52.457
<i>Do not give yourself over.</i>

04:52.459 --> 04:54.326
<i>D-do not move.</i>
<i>Do not call anyone.</i>

04:54.328 --> 04:55.827
<i>I am coming to you right now.</i>

04:55.829 --> 04:59.298
[ cellphone beeps ]
you told me daniel douglas
was drunk,

04:59.300 --> 05:00.966
That he hit his head
in the bathroom.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.668
Huck: The coroner
must have lied to us.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.403
David: Paid off
by cyrus beene, no doubt.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.470
Cyrus hates sally.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.672
He'd love to see her
go to jail.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.939
We'd have no opposition
in the election.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.642
It does
when you throw in the fact

05:10.644 --> 05:11.977
Cyrus set this all up
in the first place

05:11.979 --> 05:15.047
That's how james
got involved in this?

05:15.049 --> 05:18.083
So, he's working with you
against his husband?

05:18.085 --> 05:19.918
James is just as committed
to this as I am,

05:19.920 --> 05:21.887
And you should be, too.
This isn't the only tape, liv.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.890
We have one of him talking
to leo bergen about cleanup.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.892
We have an autopsy
that was rushed through

05:26.894 --> 05:29.061
Without so much
as a single photo of the body.

05:29.063 --> 05:31.930
Watergate
had less to go on.
This is ridiculous!

05:31.932 --> 05:36.401
If cyrus beene needed to cover
up a murder, he'd come to me.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.370
We <i>are</i> the best.
You chose us.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.073
Maybe, somehow, he was worried
you'd do the right thing.

05:41.075 --> 05:44.042
This is your chance to be
on the right side again, liv.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.677
Help me bring a murderer,

05:45.679 --> 05:48.613
The vice president of
the United States, to justice.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.624
[ knock on door ]

05:59.626 --> 06:01.860

to the debate prep?

06:01.862 --> 06:06.064

Sally doesn't stand a --
I know about
daniel douglas.

[ sighs ]

06:08.435 --> 06:09.835
I know everything.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.870
Liv, I have this under control.
You have to trust me.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.939
[ breathes deeply ]

06:17.043 --> 06:18.643
So, it's true.

06:18.645 --> 06:19.978
You did this?

Nothing.

it's -- it's not funny.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.178
It's just that --

What? It's just what?
What?

06:56.183 --> 06:58.717

they're all murderers --

06:58.719 --> 07:01.453

The presidential debate --

07:04.024 --> 07:05.991

No matter
who gets elected --

The fresh start...

07:31.585 --> 07:38.023
The chance we promised fitz
to run and run clean, it's gone.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.891
You took that from him

07:39.893 --> 07:41.860
The moment you sold your husband
to daniel douglas.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.628
You took his chance.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.597
You made this dirty.

07:45.599 --> 07:49.234
You huffed, and you puffed,
and you blew his house down.
No. No.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.937
That -- that candidate
down there in the debate room,

07:51.939 --> 07:54.940
That's a fitzgerald grant
we haven't seen in a long time.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.908
He's the candidate
that made us believe

07:56.910 --> 07:58.810
That giving up our lives
in service to him,

07:58.812 --> 08:01.112
To our country
was the noble thing to do.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.482
He never has to know
what happened.

08:03.484 --> 08:04.850
Oh, here we go.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.551
Liv, he's ready
to win this thing!

08:06.553 --> 08:09.955
So, now this is the part
where I say that he can't.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.823
Where I point out
that he can't win

08:11.825 --> 08:14.125
If his chief of staff
and his wife go to jail

08:14.127 --> 08:17.929
And then here's the part
where <i>you</i> say that you --

08:17.931 --> 08:20.799
All you have to do is
make sure we keep a lid
on this, fitz included.

08:23.202 --> 08:25.036
Right.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.238
Where you say <i>that.</i>

Okay, liv...

08:47.995 --> 08:50.862
You cannot tell fitz.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.964
Liv, I'm begging you.
You can't tell him.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.633
We just need
to get through.

What are you gonna do?

08:55.969 --> 08:57.002
You're on our side.

You cannot let this out.

You're on your own.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.225
I'm sorry.
You want me to what?

09:20.227 --> 09:22.761
Answer the phone when it rings,
which won't be that often,

09:22.763 --> 09:25.664
You say "acme limited"
in your friendliest voice

09:25.666 --> 09:27.165
And proceed to sell
the lucky caller some paper.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.301
Paper?
It's called
paying your dues.

Where's my gun?

Technically, you're
not an agent. Your
status is still pending.

Now, you're free to kill anyone
who walks through that door.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.113

with your boyfriend

20:28.428 --> 20:31.395
But it does hinge
on the american people

are not murderers.
