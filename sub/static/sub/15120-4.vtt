00:01.520 --> 00:07.599
This programme contains some violent
scenes and some scenes of a sexual nature.

00:08.640 --> 00:10.759
- I was set up.
- You think it was me?

00:10.760 --> 00:13.439
- Do you expect to come back to work?
- I'm your best operative.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.359
Target is Jack Turner.

00:15.360 --> 00:18.599
Mr Turner is currently bidding
to acquire the Upper Kyber Dam.

00:18.600 --> 00:19.999
- Hey!
- Dad!

00:20.000 --> 00:23.098
Dad, this is Alex Kent -
she saved Eddie.

00:23.223 --> 00:25.859
Keel says there's a mole on the team.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.900
What's it going to take
for you to trust me again?

00:27.901 --> 00:29.579
I should expose you to Keel right now.

00:29.580 --> 00:32.339
It's my future in there...
and yours.

00:32.340 --> 00:34.939
Make friends, find the case.
Do you think you can manage that?

00:34.940 --> 00:36.779
How about a drink?

00:36.780 --> 00:38.940
- I've seen one of those blokes before.
- Yeah, when?

00:38.941 --> 00:40.780
Dragging Hasan into the house.

00:43.940 --> 00:47.139
JTRP Holdings, £1 billion.

00:47.140 --> 00:50.379
Our bid was 970 million,

00:50.380 --> 00:53.219
we're short 30 million quid.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.259
These reports on Byzantium,

00:55.260 --> 00:57.419
where did they go?

00:57.420 --> 00:58.939
They're going to kill you.

00:58.940 --> 01:00.619
Hourglass.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.220
What's Hourglass?

02:50.660 --> 02:52.579
OK, there he goes.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.659
Yeah, but where?

02:54.660 --> 02:56.099
Are you seeing this, Fowkes?

02:56.100 --> 02:58.659
'Turner's on the move,
you better get going.'

02:58.660 --> 03:00.819
On it.

03:00.820 --> 03:02.340
Cretin.

03:06.340 --> 03:09.300
Sam's searching the office now.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.659
Sam? Fowkes is tailing Bingham.

03:39.660 --> 03:42.939
No, we picked up Turner saying he was
going to meeting a tonight. 'He is.'

03:42.940 --> 03:45.179
Bingham was a decoy. 'Shit.'

03:45.180 --> 03:48.459
I'll follow him. No, it's too risky, Sam.
I'll have Fowkes turn around.

03:48.460 --> 03:50.179
He won't make it back in time.

03:50.180 --> 03:52.419
OK, I'll go.
'You won't make it, either.'

03:52.420 --> 03:54.339
Just have Fowkes track my mobile signal.

03:54.340 --> 03:55.620
OK.

04:55.820 --> 04:57.140
Deacon.

04:59.020 --> 05:00.899
What brings you here?

05:00.900 --> 05:02.219
I need to talk.

05:02.220 --> 05:04.859
Our mole. Can't be anyone else.

05:04.860 --> 05:07.659
It's got to be Aidan.
But you've no proof.

05:07.660 --> 05:10.219
He's too smart. We're not going
to catch him in the act.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.699
What makes you think it's him?

05:11.700 --> 05:15.179
Unexplained phone calls, disappears
into dead ground for hours at a time.

05:15.180 --> 05:17.259
You've had him followed?

05:17.260 --> 05:18.780
I've had them ALL followed.

05:21.540 --> 05:24.420
- What do you propose?
- Set a trap. Draw him in.

05:26.060 --> 05:27.540
And if he sees through it?

05:28.980 --> 05:30.619
We can't just leave him in play.

05:30.620 --> 05:33.379
Not if he got Hasan captured.

05:33.380 --> 05:37.419
If we bring him in without evidence,
he may never admit to it.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.659
We need the answers
before we ask the questions.

05:39.660 --> 05:41.740
We can't just do nothing.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.700
Leave it with me.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.540
Yeah.

05:58.980 --> 06:00.380
I've got to go.

06:06.180 --> 06:07.220
Jack.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.659
Sam's sending the plate now.

06:23.660 --> 06:25.739
OK, I'm running it.

06:36.660 --> 06:39.179
Please, Vince...
At least consider it.

06:39.180 --> 06:40.739
There is nothing to consider.

06:40.740 --> 06:42.699
I'd say there is.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.859
Mr Turner's told you
how much he's willing to pay.

06:45.860 --> 06:48.019
It's a lot of cash.

06:48.020 --> 06:50.219
You think this is about money?

06:50.220 --> 06:53.099
You have perverted everything
I've taught you.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.899
I'm trying to help you,
I know you need the money.

06:55.900 --> 06:58.499
Please, Vince. You have to do this.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.059
No, I don't. And neither do you.

07:01.060 --> 07:02.499
We'll double it.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.659
Please, you've got to see sense.

07:04.660 --> 07:06.059
Lewis...

07:06.060 --> 07:07.939
You're better than this.

07:12.020 --> 07:14.380
Just tell me what you want, Vince.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.580
Whatever you want, I'll do it.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.379
I want both of you to stop this now.

07:22.380 --> 07:24.060
Or I'm calling the police.

07:31.620 --> 07:33.699
God...

07:33.700 --> 07:35.299
What have you done?

07:35.300 --> 07:38.379
You were wasting your time.
He was never going to go for it.

07:40.020 --> 07:41.780
Someone's there!

08:07.500 --> 08:09.740
- Fancy a ride?
- Where the hell have you been?!

08:17.940 --> 08:20.780
Get Everett down here.
We need a clean-up.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.058
You OK?

08:34.059 --> 08:35.220
Fine.

08:37.260 --> 08:38.739
What did you get?

08:38.740 --> 08:41.739
An ID on the victim.
Is this the guy you saw killed?

08:41.740 --> 08:44.139
Yes. Who was he?

08:44.140 --> 08:47.379
His name's Vincent Cage,
he was a left-wing economics expert,

08:47.380 --> 08:49.979
published papers on predatory capitalism.

08:49.980 --> 08:52.120
What about Turner's friend?

08:52.121 --> 08:54.521
His name's Lewis Conroy
. Billion-pound hedge-fund manager,

08:54.522 --> 08:56.659
handles some of the UK's
top venture capitalists.

08:56.660 --> 08:59.459
- Including Jack Turner?
- Yeah, they met through Stephen.

08:59.460 --> 09:01.219
He and Conroy roomed together at Oxford.

09:01.220 --> 09:03.899
Cage was threatening to go to the police.

09:03.900 --> 09:07.099
He said Conroy had perverted
everything he'd taught him.

09:07.100 --> 09:09.060
He didn't say how.

09:09.061 --> 09:11.861
Do you think this has something to
do with the 30 million Jack needs?

09:11.862 --> 09:15.019
It must be something important, for
him to have beaten a man to death.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.660
How did this happen?

09:17.940 --> 09:20.779
- I tore it getting away.
- Were you seen?

09:20.780 --> 09:22.660
Conroy saw me at the window.
It was a fraction

09:22.661 --> 09:24.460
of a second. Then
they came after me.

09:25.780 --> 09:27.800
You can't go back in that house, Sam.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.161
It was dark, my hood was up.
They couldn't see me clearly.

09:31.060 --> 09:33.500
If you're wrong, Jack will kill you.

09:34.860 --> 09:36.100
I can handle it.

09:39.020 --> 09:40.259
I said I can handle it.

09:40.260 --> 09:43.060
Now, let me go
before they find I'm missing.

10:43.140 --> 10:44.820
Sam...

10:53.820 --> 10:54.939
Who sent them?

10:54.940 --> 10:57.860
- Hourglass.
- What's Hourglass?

12:06.580 --> 12:09.459
Police have no prints,
no murder weapons and no suspects.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.440
Sam saw Turner bash in
this bloke's skull. One

12:11.441 --> 12:13.419
call to the cops, he's locked up for good.

12:13.420 --> 12:15.979
Right.
And then, Sam's cover is blown.

12:15.980 --> 12:19.179
And we lose all chance of
finding out what Turner's game is.

12:19.180 --> 12:21.160
Yep. Other than that,
it's really good thinking.

12:21.161 --> 12:23.139
So we just let the
bastard get away with it?

12:23.140 --> 12:27.339
What we need to know is where he's getting
the 30 million he needs to buy the dam.

12:27.340 --> 12:29.339
Can't do that if
he's sitting in a jail cell.

12:29.340 --> 12:30.859
What's he been up to this morning?

12:30.860 --> 12:32.899
Nothing.
No attempts to secure a loan.

12:32.900 --> 12:35.779
No trades placed with Conroy,
or anyone else, for that matter.

12:35.780 --> 12:39.299
Isn't that odd? For a man
that needs £30 million by tomorrow.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.139
Unless he's been buying lottery
tickets we don't know about.

12:44.700 --> 12:47.819
My new best mate, Dave Ryder.
Wants me back at the club.

12:47.820 --> 12:50.739
You still need to find that case
that Horst Goebel brought Turner.

12:50.740 --> 12:53.659
- Like I'd ever forget...
- Yeah.

12:53.660 --> 12:55.979
Where are <i>you</i> going?

12:55.980 --> 12:59.140
- You need me for something?
- You didn't answer my question.

13:01.380 --> 13:04.379
I'm going to go and talk to some
colleagues of the late Professor Cage

13:04.380 --> 13:06.819
to try and determine
why Turner killed him.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.460
If that's all right with you.

13:31.260 --> 13:33.060
Dad? You ready?

14:45.180 --> 14:47.299
It's been a year, Stevie.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.340
We've all got to move on, eh?

15:22.420 --> 15:25.019
Lewis! Jack, I need a word.

15:25.020 --> 15:26.700
Don't even think about it.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.419
Uncle Lewis!

15:30.420 --> 15:32.339
Hey! Eddie!

15:32.340 --> 15:34.099
How's my favourite godson?

15:34.100 --> 15:35.860
I'm your <i>only</i> godson.

15:35.861 --> 15:37.821
I've got you a present.
You're going to love it.

15:37.822 --> 15:39.859
Hi, I'm Alex, Eddie's tutor.

15:39.860 --> 15:42.979
Alex...
Stephen's told me all about you.

15:42.980 --> 15:45.059
I'm Lewis. Lewis Conroy.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.939
Hey, how have you been?

15:52.820 --> 15:55.580
- You all right?
- Yeah, how are you?

16:29.620 --> 16:31.340
Sir, may I have a word, please?

16:32.580 --> 16:33.740
What is it?

16:36.900 --> 16:38.300
There you go, champ.

16:45.100 --> 16:48.139
Wicked! This is Jackson
and Sammy's favourite game!

16:48.140 --> 16:50.539
- Zombie Killer Death-trap?
- It's educational.

16:50.540 --> 16:53.299
Teaches you about physics
and spatial co-ordination.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.300
There's a lot of maths
and coding goes into this.

16:55.301 --> 16:56.579
Ok, I'm convinced.

16:56.580 --> 17:00.220
- One hour, Eddie. No more.
- Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Lewis!

17:01.700 --> 17:03.459
I could do with a drink.

17:03.460 --> 17:05.979
Sounds like a brilliant idea.

17:05.980 --> 17:07.898
Alex?

17:07.900 --> 17:10.579
What about you? Fancy a drop?

17:10.579 --> 17:12.138
No, thanks.

17:12.140 --> 17:15.300
Come on, Alex. Eddie's going to be wasting
his brain for the next hour anyway.

17:16.180 --> 17:18.980
- Sure. I'll keep you company.
- Great.

17:25.700 --> 17:28.659
- You've looked everywhere?
- The jacket's not in the house.

17:28.660 --> 17:30.859
Maybe she dumped it outside.

17:30.860 --> 17:33.379
You said last night
you saw a woman and a man.

17:33.380 --> 17:34.939
It might not have been her.

17:34.940 --> 17:37.500
MIGHT not.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.820
Is Dave Ryder about?

17:46.220 --> 17:47.500
Cheers, mate.

17:59.420 --> 18:01.779
Why should I have to pay for this
out of my own pocket?

18:01.780 --> 18:04.020
You really don't want to make this
my problem, Ryder.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.179
Leave it with me, I'll sort it.

18:07.180 --> 18:10.220
Yeah, you do that. Call me after.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.780
- Who was that, then?
- Never you mind.

18:27.140 --> 18:30.659
All I do round here
is take flak for the guv'nor.

18:30.660 --> 18:32.620
I'm just trying to do my job.
For Christ's sake!

18:32.621 --> 18:34.380
Give us it here.

18:38.460 --> 18:40.740
Used to do this for my old man.

18:41.860 --> 18:43.779
He got one of his hands blown off,

18:43.780 --> 18:46.579
- fighting in the Gulf War.
- You a Forces boy, then?

18:46.580 --> 18:49.779
Yeah, moved around all over
the place when I was growing up.

18:49.780 --> 18:53.859
Germany, a lot.
Couple of years in Northern Ireland.

18:53.860 --> 18:56.099
I got some Irish in me, on my mum's side.

18:56.100 --> 18:59.380
Dad was East End, though.
Worked on the docks all his life.

19:00.420 --> 19:02.259
Thought I would, too.

19:02.260 --> 19:06.299
But here I am, in this old game.

19:06.300 --> 19:09.859
My mum and dad don't see me no more.

19:09.860 --> 19:12.619
Not since I did ten months
for breaking and entering.

19:12.620 --> 19:16.140
That's a shame. A lad needs family.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.340
You're all right, son.

19:26.140 --> 19:27.500
Thanks.

19:31.220 --> 19:33.059
So what did you get me over here for?

19:33.060 --> 19:35.420
- Do you want a job?
- If you got one going.

19:37.740 --> 19:39.540
Grab hold of that.

19:45.340 --> 19:47.900
Come on, while we're still young.

19:57.460 --> 19:58.660
This is Gary.

20:19.860 --> 20:22.260
- Then you lost the shoes, right?
- No, YOU lost the shoes.

20:22.261 --> 20:25.459
I fell on my arse.
In a bathrobe, bare backside...

20:25.460 --> 20:27.779
And the little Dutch girl's hat...

20:27.780 --> 20:31.059
- I was not wearing a Dutch girl's hat!
- So you two met at Oxford?

20:31.060 --> 20:34.499
We shared rooms our first year.
We were a good pair, though,

20:34.500 --> 20:38.099
The penniless Belfast chancer and
the heir to his old man's millions.

20:38.100 --> 20:40.059
Wasn't hard,
I just paid for all the drinks.

20:40.060 --> 20:42.379
And I introduced him to Becky.

20:42.380 --> 20:44.539
Actually, I met her first,
at a law lecture.

20:44.540 --> 20:46.299
And then she started going out with him.

20:46.300 --> 20:49.459
Alex, if you only knew the heartache.
When she dumped me for Steve...

20:49.460 --> 20:52.419
YOU broke up with her, like
he breaks up with all the girls.

20:52.420 --> 20:55.579
No, but Becky was different.
She was special.

20:55.580 --> 20:57.459
She made the right choice, though.

20:57.460 --> 21:00.620
She knew Stephen would make her
happier than I ever could.

21:08.940 --> 21:11.500
I... I'll be back in a minute.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.900
Steve.

21:23.980 --> 21:25.859
I'm sorry, I'm a moron.

21:25.860 --> 21:28.299
- She didn't make the right choice.
- Steve, don't...

21:28.300 --> 21:30.299
Look at you. You did it yourself.

21:30.300 --> 21:33.499
I've always had my father,
but you, you made your own fortune,

21:33.500 --> 21:34.859
with your own honest talent.

21:34.860 --> 21:38.580
And I'm still here in this house,
with all this dirty money.

21:41.660 --> 21:43.340
Becky wanted to be with you.

21:44.540 --> 21:46.459
She loved you so much.

21:46.460 --> 21:48.059
That's all that matters.

21:48.060 --> 21:52.020
I wasn't the man she thought I was.

21:54.620 --> 21:56.740
Of course I couldn't save her.

22:00.140 --> 22:02.140
You're the best man I know.

22:03.820 --> 22:07.380
If <i>you</i> couldn't save her,
then no-one could.

22:12.900 --> 22:15.420
Lewis. A word before you go?

22:34.340 --> 22:35.859
About last night...

22:35.860 --> 22:37.980
- We can't go through with this.
- Of course we can.

22:37.981 --> 22:39.859
No. No, we can't. It's too risky.

22:39.860 --> 22:43.779
The only risk was your Commie
professor shooting his mouth off.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.459
And I took care of that.

22:45.460 --> 22:48.699
The police will be looking for who
killed Vince. And they'll find him.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.059
You let me worry about the police.

22:51.060 --> 22:53.659
We'll need a list

22:53.660 --> 22:55.419
of all the women in your office,

22:55.420 --> 22:58.219
any women you've seen socially
in the past few months.

22:58.220 --> 23:00.779
What? What for?

23:00.780 --> 23:03.219
You might've been followed last night.

23:03.220 --> 23:07.380
- No-one followed me.
- All the same. Just to be safe.

23:10.460 --> 23:12.500
What will you do if you find her?

23:13.700 --> 23:16.540
You just get Bingham the list, all right?

23:19.020 --> 23:21.379
Cheer up, Lewis.

23:21.380 --> 23:25.060
This time tomorrow,
you'll be richer than ever.

23:38.780 --> 23:42.259
What was that about?
The 30 million?

23:42.260 --> 23:45.899
- 30 million...?
- You trying to tell me he hasn't told you?

23:45.900 --> 23:47.820
We're short on our bid for the dam.
If we don't

23:47.821 --> 23:49.739
raise 30 million by tomorrow, we're out.

23:49.740 --> 23:51.860
He just asked me about the
accounts, Steve, I swear.

23:51.861 --> 23:53.060
He never mentioned it.

23:54.780 --> 23:57.060
He keeps telling me not to
worry, that he's got it

23:57.061 --> 23:59.339
all under control, but I
know he's up to something.

24:00.620 --> 24:04.500
Listen, do you mind if I ask her out?

24:08.220 --> 24:11.339
What, are we back in school? Do you
want me to ask her out FOR you?

24:11.340 --> 24:13.740
It's OK, isn't it? I mean,
you're not that way about her...

24:13.741 --> 24:14.739
It's fine.

24:14.740 --> 24:17.380
- Go for it.
- Thanks.

24:33.860 --> 24:35.500
What are you doing tonight?

24:37.060 --> 24:38.819
Just looking after Eddie.

24:38.820 --> 24:40.300
And after that?

24:42.060 --> 24:45.060
See you, Eddie. See you, Lewis.

24:46.580 --> 24:49.940
Tonight, after she's put Eddie to bed.

24:51.300 --> 24:53.739
You take care of yourself.

24:53.740 --> 24:56.020
You too.

25:28.380 --> 25:31.899
- Where we off to, mate?
- Don't call me mate, right?

25:31.900 --> 25:34.819
- So what <i>do</i> I call you?
- Mr Tyrone.

25:34.820 --> 25:38.340
Ok. Mr T.

25:40.460 --> 25:41.860
So you've known Dave a while?

25:43.620 --> 25:45.420
Seems like a nice enough bloke.

25:48.780 --> 25:51.780
- Enjoy a bit of conversation, do you?
- Look, here's how it works.

25:53.020 --> 25:55.739
I tell you what to do.

25:55.740 --> 25:57.140
You keep your mouth shut.

25:59.780 --> 26:01.380
All right.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.580
You see that?

26:26.900 --> 26:28.060
Black pick-up.

26:31.380 --> 26:33.700
Just wait a second.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.220
Nice fella.

26:47.700 --> 26:50.059
Put the bag in the boot
before he comes back.

26:50.060 --> 26:52.740
- How do I do that?
- You ever use one of these?

26:53.980 --> 26:55.260
Once or twice.

26:58.060 --> 26:59.660
What's in the bag?

27:02.220 --> 27:03.700
Suit yourself.

27:24.220 --> 27:26.779
Oi! Who the shitting hell are you?

27:26.780 --> 27:29.859
- No-one, mate.
- Oi! Then, what you doing by my car?

27:29.860 --> 27:32.019
I made a mistake,
walked down the wrong street.

27:32.020 --> 27:33.419
Nah, you didn't.

27:33.420 --> 27:36.619
You walked into the wrong
bloody life, mate. So say sorry.

27:36.620 --> 27:38.500
Come on, say sorry.

28:49.140 --> 28:51.140
This the man you told me about?

28:53.420 --> 28:55.300
Your colleague who passed away?

29:02.460 --> 29:04.819
Yeah, that's him.

29:04.820 --> 29:07.699
You said you didn't even like him.

29:07.700 --> 29:09.380
Nobody did.

29:11.700 --> 29:14.900
That doesn't stop me
from praying for his soul.

29:18.940 --> 29:20.580
Come by for a drink sometime.

29:21.900 --> 29:23.700
You look like you could use one.

29:41.060 --> 29:43.739
Simran, my favourite fiancee.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.859
- How are the wedding plans coming on?
- Insane.

29:45.860 --> 29:47.659
Costing a bloody fortune.

29:47.660 --> 29:50.019
It'll be worth it.
Let me know if you need any help.

29:50.020 --> 29:54.699
I already owe you for this job.
You've done more than enough.

29:54.700 --> 29:57.139
Then, perhaps you wouldn't mind
doing me another favour.

29:57.140 --> 30:00.059
You need to fill out
the authorisation, Aidan.

30:00.060 --> 30:01.899
I'll get into so much trouble.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.180
Only if somebody finds out.

30:06.780 --> 30:08.819
OK. What is it?

30:08.820 --> 30:11.899
I've been following a lead,
but I keep hitting a dead end.

30:11.900 --> 30:16.099
- Do you know anything about Hourglass?
- What's Hourglass?

30:16.100 --> 30:19.260
That's what I need you to tell me, Ok?

30:32.740 --> 30:35.019
- Thank you for coming, Natalie.
- Not at all.

30:35.020 --> 30:37.180
Aidan!

30:39.860 --> 30:42.779
Have you met Natalie Thorpe?

30:42.780 --> 30:45.779
MI6's liaison officer for Byzantium.

30:45.780 --> 30:48.260
- Aidan Marsh. Pleased to meet you.
- You too.

30:56.660 --> 30:58.700
I squeezed in this meeting
because you said it

30:58.701 --> 31:00.739
was urgent, Mr Keel, but
I don't have much time.

31:00.740 --> 31:04.539
I'm fully appreciative of your time,
Natalie.

31:04.540 --> 31:07.699
Also, of your considerable track record.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.539
That's interesting.

31:09.540 --> 31:12.339
Considering my track record
is restricted information.

31:12.340 --> 31:14.219
When you leave your post at MI6,

31:14.220 --> 31:16.699
you'll be a highly sought-after
commodity.

31:16.700 --> 31:20.060
IF I leave. And
I don't consider myself a commodity.

31:21.580 --> 31:26.139
I'm prepared to advance your salary,
unofficially, of course.

31:26.140 --> 31:29.459
It could be accruing interest now
in a Zurich account.

31:29.460 --> 31:33.739
You didn't seriously ask me here
to offer me a bribe?

31:33.740 --> 31:35.819
I'm offering you a job.

31:35.820 --> 31:37.739
In exchange for?

31:37.740 --> 31:39.780
The name of your mole in my outfit.

31:43.180 --> 31:46.139
You're required by law
to share intelligence

31:46.140 --> 31:49.739
on issues of national security.
Why would I need a mole?

31:49.740 --> 31:51.420
You tell me.

31:53.260 --> 31:56.860
MI6 has no mole at Byzantium, Mr Keel.

31:59.660 --> 32:00.980
You're very good.

32:02.660 --> 32:07.339
Please, allow me to persuade you
to reconsider.

32:07.340 --> 32:12.099
So I can happily trot away to join your
bunch of quasi-criminal mercenaries?

32:12.100 --> 32:14.059
You've misread me.

32:14.060 --> 32:16.699
I'm touched by your faith
in Queen and Country.

32:16.700 --> 32:20.260
Do you believe in anything, Mr Keel?
Or are you wholly for sale?

32:23.620 --> 32:26.659
The men who employ me
use their power and influence

32:26.660 --> 32:29.699
to appoint the Government
whose orders you follow.

32:29.700 --> 32:32.139
You've been bought and paid for,
Natalie, just as I have.

32:32.140 --> 32:35.860
The only difference is...
I don't pretend otherwise.

32:43.700 --> 32:49.259
The offer remains open. If you
change your mind, I'll be waiting.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.660
Goodbye, Mr Keel.

33:02.220 --> 33:05.819
- How did it go?
- He said to come back tonight.

33:05.820 --> 33:07.579
Then, you done good.

33:30.140 --> 33:32.179
Got something?

33:32.180 --> 33:35.019
We have a direction
in which to look. How about you?

33:35.020 --> 33:38.699
I finally got into Jack's office...
Nothing.

33:38.700 --> 33:40.680
Zoe.

33:40.681 --> 33:43.001
So we know Turner made his
money from Docklands property.

33:43.002 --> 33:45.640
His income growth was steady,
if unspectacular, until

33:45.641 --> 33:48.619
2004, when he met Stephen's
friend from Oxford.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.819
With the help of his mentor, Vince Cage,

33:50.820 --> 33:54.619
Conroy was one of the first mathematicians
to develop a revolutionary idea.

33:54.620 --> 33:57.099
It's a trading algorithm he called Kismet.

33:57.100 --> 33:59.859
So decisions that took floor traders
hours to make

33:59.860 --> 34:02.019
were now made by computers in nanoseconds.

34:02.020 --> 34:03.459
Now, over the past eight years,

34:03.460 --> 34:06.099
Kismet has quadrupled
the value of Turner's portfolio,

34:06.100 --> 34:09.659
from £80 million to more than 300 million.

34:09.659 --> 34:12.579
Cage said Conroy had perverted
everything he'd taught him.

34:12.580 --> 34:16.739
Hard to see how. 300 million quid,
thanks to some bloody software.

34:16.739 --> 34:18.219
What about those spikes there?

34:18.219 --> 34:20.699
Yeah, Kismet capitalises
almost instantaneously

34:20.699 --> 34:24.059
on unexpected events,
so accidents, disasters...

34:24.060 --> 34:27.699
They're making key stock trades
before anyone else has time to react.

34:27.699 --> 34:30.018
Whatever Cage knew threatened Turner.

34:30.020 --> 34:33.418
Somehow, he needs to raise
30 million by tomorrow morning.

34:33.420 --> 34:35.940
I'll try and find out this evening.
I have a date with Conroy.

34:35.940 --> 34:36.780
That was quick.

34:38.219 --> 34:40.339
I'll need a sedative.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.980
I'll get you something discreet.

34:44.260 --> 34:46.418
- Thank you, everyone. Zoe.
- Yeah?

34:46.420 --> 34:47.978
Goebel's case has gone missing.

34:47.980 --> 34:50.139
Really?

34:50.139 --> 34:53.179
Yeah, I saw it at the club this morning.

34:53.179 --> 34:55.418
Gone by the time
I got back this afternoon.

34:55.420 --> 34:57.459
Goebel hasn't been seen
since the Turner House.

34:57.460 --> 35:00.179
Go to Amsterdam and find out
what was in that case. Right away.

35:00.180 --> 35:02.820
Bring us back some cheese, yeah?
Maybe some wooden shoes.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.059
I had a meeting with Natalie Thorpe today.

35:07.060 --> 35:10.579
And? I offered her a job in exchange
for the name of the mole.

35:10.580 --> 35:13.179
- She'll never accept.
- Of course not.

35:13.180 --> 35:15.179
But I don't intend
to take no for an answer.

35:15.180 --> 35:18.340
Meanwhile, the lives of my team
are still in danger.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.340
That's what we pay them for, Deacon.

35:23.060 --> 35:24.700
And you.

35:36.180 --> 35:37.620
Good afternoon, Lewis.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.779
Afternoon, Trudy.

35:55.780 --> 35:57.220
I'll call you back.

36:00.460 --> 36:03.979
Lewis, did you see the news?

36:03.980 --> 36:05.459
It's Professor Cage.

36:05.460 --> 36:08.140
He's dead.

36:11.420 --> 36:12.900
My God.

36:14.460 --> 36:16.060
What happened?

36:17.420 --> 36:20.580
They said...
they said he was murdered.

37:12.020 --> 37:14.619
You seen my keys?

37:14.620 --> 37:17.779
So that's it?
You just shag me and leave me.

37:17.780 --> 37:19.659
You know I've got a flight to catch.

37:19.660 --> 37:21.899
Just tell me where they are, you prick.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.500
On the table. Fab, thanks.

37:33.620 --> 37:35.299
You've not paid these.

37:35.300 --> 37:37.259
Yeah, I'll get round to it.

37:37.260 --> 37:40.260
- I'll take care of it, if you want.
- I said I'd do it, and I will.

37:41.380 --> 37:42.540
Andrew...

37:48.780 --> 37:50.780
It's not the same as it was before, is it?

37:52.140 --> 37:54.300
Well...

37:55.620 --> 37:56.860
Of course it's not, Andrew.

37:58.980 --> 38:00.860
But we're OK, right?

38:05.860 --> 38:07.340
What do YOU think, eh?

38:08.980 --> 38:11.380
Be brilliant.

38:17.660 --> 38:18.699
Yeah, as ever.

38:23.140 --> 38:24.939
Hey. How did you get on?

38:24.940 --> 38:26.699
Not great, I'm afraid.

38:26.700 --> 38:29.099
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing, anywhere.

38:29.100 --> 38:30.940
And then, finally, I
thought, "The Russians."

38:30.941 --> 38:32.619
They spy on everyone, or they used to.

38:32.620 --> 38:35.619
And they're so corrupt these days,
they're reasonably porous.

38:35.620 --> 38:37.339
But I only found one reference,

38:37.340 --> 38:40.100
and I'm not even sure
it's the same Hourglass you want.

38:41.260 --> 38:43.139
1978?

38:43.140 --> 38:44.739
What is this, Cold War stuff?

38:44.740 --> 38:47.779
I don't know. The Russians were
spying on an MI6 Officer

38:47.780 --> 38:50.860
called George Ballard,
who was posted to Moscow.

38:52.100 --> 38:55.939
He kept a case file on something
called Hourglass.

38:55.940 --> 38:58.099
So Hourglass was an MI6 case file?

38:58.100 --> 39:00.859
Ballard's the kind of
a Smiley figure, low profile,

39:00.860 --> 39:02.659
career professional.

39:02.660 --> 39:06.899
It appears he kept the file open
for decades, or at least until 2004.

39:06.900 --> 39:08.819
And what happened in 2004?

39:08.820 --> 39:11.619
He transferred to London.
The Russians stopped spying on him.

39:11.620 --> 39:14.859
- Is he still in London?
- Yep. He's a Head Of Section.

39:14.860 --> 39:17.299
Byzantium's liaison officer,
Natalie Thorpe,

39:17.300 --> 39:19.219
does she report to Ballard?

39:19.220 --> 39:21.580
Directly to him. He's her boss.

39:24.580 --> 39:26.699
Why? What do you know?

39:26.700 --> 39:28.979
I don't know anything yet.

39:28.980 --> 39:31.300
But you did better than you thought.
Thank you.

39:40.820 --> 39:42.819
Good night, Eddie.

39:42.820 --> 39:44.460
Good night.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.500
You OK?

39:57.540 --> 40:00.619
It was very cold at the cemetery
this morning.

40:00.620 --> 40:02.380
Yes, it was.

40:03.620 --> 40:05.100
My dad cried.

40:06.420 --> 40:08.340
It's OK to cry when you're sad.

40:09.460 --> 40:12.500
Did you cry when your mum died?

40:15.780 --> 40:17.020
Yes, I did.

40:19.100 --> 40:21.780
I wasn't much older than you are now.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.300
Could you wake me up when you come home?

40:32.820 --> 40:34.100
Of course I will.

40:46.860 --> 40:48.660
Can you leave the door open?

40:50.380 --> 40:51.860
Sure.

41:37.820 --> 41:40.699
This is the story of the Snow Maiden.

41:40.700 --> 41:42.099
Once upon a time...

41:42.100 --> 41:43.539
Stay in the car.

41:43.540 --> 41:46.100
No! No!

41:47.500 --> 41:49.860
Get off!

41:59.460 --> 42:01.419
One scratch.

42:01.420 --> 42:03.299
I'll get his key card.

42:03.300 --> 42:05.500
- Where will you be?
- Outside.

42:09.220 --> 42:11.659
I never wanted
to see you doing this again.

42:11.660 --> 42:13.660
It's my job.

42:15.140 --> 42:17.780
It was my job long before I met you.

42:19.740 --> 42:22.819
I know we can never get back
what we lost in Tangier.

42:22.820 --> 42:24.260
What <i>we</i> lost?

42:26.460 --> 42:28.819
I was the one who got shot.

42:28.820 --> 42:31.579
You nearly lost your life.

42:31.580 --> 42:35.260
But the baby...
That was my loss, too.

42:39.380 --> 42:41.620
Was it a boy or a girl?

42:50.500 --> 42:52.220
A girl.

43:03.300 --> 43:05.860
I'm going to help you find the men
who tried to kill you, Sam.

43:07.620 --> 43:11.060
Whatever it takes. I'll find them.

43:33.140 --> 43:35.300
Get a move on.

43:36.420 --> 43:37.700
Hello to you, too...

43:41.020 --> 43:42.500
..tosser.

43:44.180 --> 43:46.899
- What's this about?
- It's just a routine search, sir.

43:46.900 --> 43:49.739
Well, you can't do that.
Where's your search warrant?!

43:49.740 --> 43:53.299
All right, Bilal.
Pimped any 12-year-old girls lately?

43:53.300 --> 43:55.779
No, I ain't done nothing.

43:55.780 --> 43:56.940
Inspector.

44:04.740 --> 44:07.179
It's our lucky day.

44:07.180 --> 44:09.339
What, what's that?

44:09.340 --> 44:12.619
Oi, get off! What's that?!

44:12.620 --> 44:16.499
Get off me! Get off, get off me!

44:35.100 --> 44:37.900
Alex, come in.

44:48.300 --> 44:50.819
You really are rich.

44:50.820 --> 44:52.459
Drink?

44:52.460 --> 44:54.540
Sure.

44:57.540 --> 45:00.940
Sorry, started without you.

45:07.820 --> 45:10.620
Is everything OK?

45:12.460 --> 45:14.419
It was you, wasn't it?

45:14.420 --> 45:16.500
Last night?

45:17.820 --> 45:21.980
- What?
- Why do you think I asked you here?

45:23.540 --> 45:26.459
I knew it was you the moment
I saw you at the cemetery.

45:26.460 --> 45:30.299
I...I don't know
what you're talking about.

45:30.300 --> 45:32.059
Yes, you do.

45:32.060 --> 45:34.379
Who are you?

45:34.380 --> 45:36.299
Why were you following Jack Turner?

45:36.300 --> 45:39.939
Following him? What are you talking
about? Don't lie to me!

45:39.940 --> 45:42.859
Do you know what
he would do if he found out?!

45:42.860 --> 45:44.619
You're scaring me...

45:44.620 --> 45:46.939
You should be scared!
I bloody well am.

45:46.940 --> 45:48.659
Why haven't you gone to the police?!

45:48.660 --> 45:51.379
I swear... I don't know
what you're talking about...

45:51.380 --> 45:52.780
You're lying!

45:55.420 --> 45:58.060
You're... you're hurting me.

46:08.980 --> 46:10.659
I'm sorry.

46:10.660 --> 46:13.500
I should never have asked you here.

46:27.260 --> 46:29.060
Let me do that.

46:37.060 --> 46:38.940
I'm really sorry, Alex.

46:42.620 --> 46:44.100
You know you can talk to me.

46:45.780 --> 46:47.379
Maybe I can help.

46:47.380 --> 46:49.939
You can't help.

46:49.940 --> 46:52.259
My life's over.

46:52.260 --> 46:54.739
Everything...

46:54.740 --> 46:56.060
It's worthless.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.300
Tell me what happened.

47:04.420 --> 47:05.660
I can't tell you.

47:07.220 --> 47:10.100
I wish to God I could tell someone.

49:05.580 --> 49:08.220
I was cut up when your mum died.

49:09.780 --> 49:12.180
- She was an angel, she was.
- Please...

49:13.740 --> 49:16.340
Let's not talk about Mum.

49:17.340 --> 49:21.340
Course, I didn't sit on my arse,
drinking myself into a puddle of piss.

49:22.820 --> 49:25.699
I worked. For you and Eddie.

49:25.700 --> 49:27.939
Yeah. I can see the great work
you did.

49:27.940 --> 49:31.539
You know your trouble, Stevie? You
need to grow yourself some balls.

49:31.540 --> 49:33.459
My wife died last year

49:33.460 --> 49:36.099
and I just want a few minutes alone
to remember her.

49:36.100 --> 49:37.858
You want to dwell on the past, instead of

49:37.859 --> 49:39.779
seeing what you want and
bloody well taking it.

49:39.780 --> 49:42.140
Cos it ain't going to come round
begging you to shag it.

49:44.220 --> 49:45.780
What are you talking about?

49:48.500 --> 49:52.619
That little tart, Alex Kent.

49:52.620 --> 49:54.939
Anybody can see by the way
you look at her.

49:59.460 --> 50:00.860
Where is she, anyway?

50:04.220 --> 50:05.500
She's out with Lewis.

50:08.580 --> 50:09.860
With Lewis...?

50:37.740 --> 50:41.779
Six e-mails from Cage to Conroy
in the past month.

50:41.780 --> 50:43.620
Subject matter - Kismet.

50:45.740 --> 50:49.219
"Eleven injured in factory fire."
"Oil tanker accident."

50:49.220 --> 50:52.859
"Toxic Milk was contaminated."
"Blast kills ten..."

50:52.860 --> 50:55.099
Disasters, accidents...

50:55.100 --> 50:58.099
Some of these go back
six or seven years...

50:58.100 --> 51:00.260
Can you pull up Jack Turner's accounts?

51:07.460 --> 51:09.019
Stop there.

51:09.020 --> 51:11.419
Look at the dates
of these spikes in earnings.

51:11.420 --> 51:15.539
July 31st 2007 and August 12th 2008,

51:15.540 --> 51:19.779
March 11th 2009, September 17th 2011...

51:19.780 --> 51:21.979
That's when Kismet makes
its biggest profits.

51:21.980 --> 51:25.219
The dates are the same as the
accidents in the newspaper articles.

51:25.220 --> 51:27.939
This is what Cage
was going to tell the police.

51:27.940 --> 51:30.099
These weren't accidents.

51:30.100 --> 51:33.739
It's how Turner's making his money.
Something's going to happen tonight.

51:33.740 --> 51:35.300
Hey! Stop!

51:45.420 --> 51:49.340
Hey! Quick! Go, go, go, go!

52:25.380 --> 52:26.780
Come on.

52:43.100 --> 52:44.739
What do I pay you for?

52:44.740 --> 52:48.059
Her being with him doesn't prove anything.

52:48.060 --> 52:51.380
Conroy's a... a shag-merchant,
you know that.

52:53.460 --> 52:55.100
What's going on with Tyrone?

52:58.340 --> 53:00.140
He should be down there now.

53:20.580 --> 53:23.659
Hey, make sure
no-one comes down here.

53:23.660 --> 53:25.779
What are <i>you</i> going to do?

53:25.780 --> 53:28.500
Sorry, no questions. Forgot.

54:46.740 --> 54:48.259
Yeah.

54:48.260 --> 54:50.940
What?! When?

54:53.060 --> 54:54.339
I'll be right there.

54:54.340 --> 54:55.420
Alex?

55:01.980 --> 55:04.139
Are you OK?

55:04.140 --> 55:07.019
Something's come up at work. Sorry.

55:07.020 --> 55:09.340
It's OK, I can call myself a cab.

55:17.420 --> 55:20.219
Sir... Sir?

55:20.220 --> 55:21.460
Lewis.

55:22.820 --> 55:25.139
What is it, Lewis?

55:25.140 --> 55:27.299
There's been a break-in
at my office.

55:27.300 --> 55:29.379
Who broke in?

55:29.380 --> 55:31.939
I don't know, it was a woman
and a man. Same as last night.

55:31.940 --> 55:34.059
Is Miss Kent still with you?

55:34.060 --> 55:36.659
She was. She just left.

55:36.660 --> 55:39.019
Nice.
She been with you the whole time?

55:39.020 --> 55:42.179
Well, we fell asleep
for a couple of hours, but...

55:42.180 --> 55:45.459
You fell asleep, did you? Then, how
do you know that she was with you?

55:45.460 --> 55:47.899
Jack, you're being paranoid.

55:47.900 --> 55:49.260
Am I?

55:55.020 --> 55:56.539
What's Tyrone saying?

55:56.540 --> 55:59.820
Everything's in order.
It bloody well better be.

56:10.500 --> 56:11.939
'Aidan, you need to get down

56:11.940 --> 56:14.579
'to an old underground
tram station - Aldwych.'

56:14.580 --> 56:17.699
There was a photo of that
tram station in Turner's office.

56:17.700 --> 56:19.859
Fowkes thinks Turner's man
did some damage there.

56:19.860 --> 56:23.299
We think that's how he's making money -
staging accidents so Kismet can profit.

56:23.300 --> 56:25.579
Then, you don't have much time.
Going there now.

56:25.580 --> 56:28.780
No, you get back the house, Sam.
Turner's been asking about you.

57:28.380 --> 57:29.940
Deacon, I'm here.

57:35.140 --> 57:36.779
What can you see?

57:36.780 --> 57:38.619
Nothing. I can't see anything. But...

57:38.620 --> 57:41.660
..there's a strong smell of gas.

57:46.220 --> 57:48.139
You better get out of there now.

57:48.140 --> 57:49.699
'What's going on?'

57:49.700 --> 57:53.299
He's going to blow up a building.
Goncourt & Co, on Travers Street.

57:53.300 --> 57:54.860
Get out now - that's an order!

57:57.980 --> 58:00.260
We need to get this whole area
evacuated immediately.

58:08.260 --> 58:09.620
Wait! Stop!

58:17.100 --> 58:18.699
They're reporting a fatality.

58:18.700 --> 58:22.139
- I'm done, Jack.
- You don't stop until I tell you to stop.

58:22.140 --> 58:23.899
He's become a problem, hasn't he?

58:23.900 --> 58:25.099
We've got a situation.

58:25.100 --> 58:29.139
We just want to ask you about the work
you've been doing with Aidan Marsh.

58:29.140 --> 58:31.499
You infiltrated my organisation
with a mole.

58:31.500 --> 58:34.259
- What do you want?
- Everything, everything you know.

58:34.260 --> 58:36.779
Turner will look for the woman
that saw him murder Cage.

58:36.780 --> 58:38.460
Can you ensure Turner gets the names?

58:38.461 --> 58:40.301
- You know what he'll do.
- That's the point.

58:40.302 --> 58:43.059
- Two people are going to die.
- You have to stop it.

58:43.060 --> 58:45.260
Why did you ask to see me
again after all these years?

58:45.261 --> 58:46.660
Hourglass.
