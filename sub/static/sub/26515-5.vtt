03:29.514 --> 03:30.981

If trouble comes our way,
we should hear it first.

03:41.759 --> 03:46.759

about sleeping?

03:50.901 --> 03:55.072
Here we go. Four rooms.
All close to each other.

03:55.105 --> 03:57.140
Glad you had availability.

03:57.174 --> 03:59.409
Yeah, I guess
we're a little slow.

03:59.443 --> 04:01.177
It's the off-season.

04:01.211 --> 04:04.449
Huh. There's an on-season?

04:04.481 --> 04:06.550
About five years ago.

04:06.584 --> 04:09.353
That is when
my shitty ex-husband

Hey, where's the closest
place to eat around here?

Oh, uh, liquor store

has snacks.

04:18.930 --> 04:22.067
Other than that,
there's a pizza place nearby.

04:22.100 --> 04:24.367
It's, uh, Edder's.
It's actually pretty good.

04:24.401 --> 04:27.237
Okay. Appreciate it.

Oh, the, um,

So if you wanna
get it working,

04:38.281 --> 04:41.285
I'm always up late.

[Dick] All right, guys,
listen up.

04:53.463 --> 04:55.166
We're all in one piece,
more or less.

04:55.199 --> 04:58.401
We need to figure out
where we stand and determine
what's mission critical.

04:58.435 --> 05:00.303
"Mission critical"?

05:00.338 --> 05:02.841
Is that a cop thing?
Sounds like a cop thing.

05:02.874 --> 05:06.009
I had some combat training
when I was younger.

05:06.043 --> 05:06.944
And he's a cop.

05:06.978 --> 05:09.413
I'm sorry,
you were referring to "we"?

05:09.447 --> 05:12.550
"We" as of right now
are a group of people
who share a common enemy.

05:12.583 --> 05:17.120
Which makes us what?

05:17.153 --> 05:18.988
Let's call it an alliance.

05:19.023 --> 05:20.990
One born of mutual need.

05:21.024 --> 05:24.795
And what is that?

05:24.827 --> 05:25.997
To stay alive.

05:26.031 --> 05:27.966
We have no idea
how long we have
until they find us.

05:27.999 --> 05:30.401
You just said "they."
Who are they?

05:30.434 --> 05:32.036
What do they want?

05:32.069 --> 05:35.706
We don't know who they are,
but they want me.

05:35.740 --> 05:38.908
It's because of her...

05:38.908 --> 05:39.877
abilities.

05:39.877 --> 05:42.547
They make violence
look like an art form.

05:42.579 --> 05:44.149
[Dick] The people
that attacked us
fought in unison.

05:44.182 --> 05:46.783
They were perfectly
coordinated, we're not.

05:46.817 --> 05:50.920
We can't fight like that
unless we learn
each other's moves.

05:50.954 --> 05:52.557
Inspiring.

05:52.589 --> 05:55.459
And how do you
suggest we do that?

05:55.492 --> 05:57.995
We stick together

05:58.028 --> 05:59.375
and we train.

06:02.533 --> 06:04.269
Okay, in order
to work together,

06:04.302 --> 06:07.738
fight and defend yourselves
like a coordinated team,

06:07.771 --> 06:12.771
we gotta see what each other
can do. Any volunteers?

06:15.045 --> 06:19.083
Kory, Rachel said
you can create light.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.084
Heat. Is that right?

06:20.084 --> 06:22.052
Honestly, I'm still
trying to figure it out.

06:22.086 --> 06:24.487
Okay, so let's
figure it out together.

06:24.521 --> 06:25.555
How exactly does it work?

06:25.589 --> 06:28.358
I think it comes from the sun.

06:28.391 --> 06:32.329
I can absorb its power
and direct it.

06:32.362 --> 06:34.264
I'm weaker at night, though.

06:34.298 --> 06:36.567
I'm sometimes empty.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.468
And it takes me
a while to recharge.

06:38.502 --> 06:39.971
How long?

06:40.004 --> 06:43.240
A few hours, a day,
I don't know.

06:43.274 --> 06:45.242
Can you control it?

06:45.276 --> 06:46.976
Of course.

06:47.011 --> 06:48.278
Okay.

06:48.312 --> 06:51.382

28:43.961 --> 28:48.161
It's time to burn, assholes.

28:51.801 --> 28:55.251
[grunts] Fucking night!

29:06.750 --> 29:10.855
[bursting]

29:10.887 --> 29:13.124
[groans]

29:13.156 --> 29:17.761
[Gar and Rachel coughing]

29:17.795 --> 29:19.744
[metal rings]

29:27.904 --> 29:29.606
Dick?

29:29.640 --> 29:30.673
That's Robin.

29:30.708 --> 29:32.958
[both grunting]

29:48.058 --> 29:50.909
[Sis cries in pain]

29:53.464 --> 29:56.500
You should put
your toys away when
you're finished with them.

29:56.534 --> 30:00.971
[Robin grunts]

30:01.005 --> 30:02.772
[Dad groans]

30:02.807 --> 30:06.076
[growling]

30:06.109 --> 30:08.412
-[growling]
-[screams]

30:08.444 --> 30:10.847
[crashing]

30:10.882 --> 30:14.751
[distorted growling]

30:14.785 --> 30:15.920
[Sis yells]

30:15.952 --> 30:17.520
[both grunting]

30:17.555 --> 30:21.925
[Mom yelps, thuds]

30:21.959 --> 30:24.058
[tiger growls]

30:36.507 --> 30:38.942
Well...

30:38.976 --> 30:43.682
look at the mess we've made.

30:43.714 --> 30:48.353
Who are you people?
And why are you looking
for Rachel?

30:48.385 --> 30:51.923
Oh, dear, you're right.
How rude of us
to not introduce ourselves.

30:51.955 --> 30:54.425
I'm Dad. This is Mom.

30:54.459 --> 30:56.461
We're pleased to meet you,
Detective Grayson.

30:56.493 --> 31:01.164
And what a nice
bird suit that you have,
if I do say so myself.

31:01.199 --> 31:03.534
That was quite unexpected.

31:03.567 --> 31:05.001
Quite.

31:05.036 --> 31:06.503
I asked her a question.

31:06.538 --> 31:11.209
Yes, you did. My apologies.
All the fighting...

31:11.241 --> 31:13.477
to deliver her, of course.

31:13.509 --> 31:14.711
To who?

31:14.744 --> 31:16.681
Why, our employer, dear.

31:16.714 --> 31:20.517
Why are you
and your weird family
trying to kill me?

31:20.550 --> 31:22.853
You should come with us.

31:22.886 --> 31:24.855
Seriously.

31:24.888 --> 31:28.092
It'd be better for everyone.

31:28.125 --> 31:33.125
If not, we're all
going to be in trouble.

31:35.266 --> 31:37.401
You don't wanna be
in trouble.

31:37.433 --> 31:41.138
No, you do not.

31:41.172 --> 31:43.141
Who's your employer?

31:43.173 --> 31:46.743
I can't answer that.

31:46.777 --> 31:48.878
Loose lips sink ships.

31:48.913 --> 31:50.280
That's true.

31:50.315 --> 31:51.882
Nobody likes a tattletale.

31:51.915 --> 31:53.017
Okay, it's my turn.

31:53.049 --> 31:55.685
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Wait!

31:55.719 --> 31:58.722
Come here.

31:58.757 --> 32:01.292
The way they're reacting,
I've seen this behavior
before back in Gotham.

32:01.326 --> 32:04.060
They're brainwashed.
Beating the shit out of them
isn't gonna make a difference.

32:04.095 --> 32:05.229
Okay, so now what?

32:05.262 --> 32:08.432
Help yourselves.
Give us the girl.

32:08.465 --> 32:11.836
And we'll be on our way,
lickety-split.

32:11.868 --> 32:13.237
[Dick sighs]

32:13.270 --> 32:18.270
[Dick] I'm gonna check
their car, see what I find.

32:30.487 --> 32:35.259
[door opens]

32:35.292 --> 32:37.795
So you're Robin, huh?

32:37.827 --> 32:38.863
That's your big secret?

32:38.895 --> 32:42.867
I was gonna tell you.

32:42.901 --> 32:46.703
Look, when I was in Detroit,
I was planning on
leaving Robin behind.

32:46.737 --> 32:48.806
No luck, huh?

32:48.838 --> 32:51.674
Why?

32:51.709 --> 32:55.346
When I put on that mask...

32:55.380 --> 32:59.150
When I put it on,
I become someone...

32:59.182 --> 33:02.853
someone I can't control.

33:02.886 --> 33:06.223
Someone that likes
hurting people.

33:06.257 --> 33:07.958
I know the feeling.

33:07.991 --> 33:09.125
[chuckles softly]

33:09.160 --> 33:11.259
I know you do.

33:14.265 --> 33:18.602
So, uh, Batman...
[chuckles]

33:18.635 --> 33:19.971
you know him?

33:20.003 --> 33:21.704
[Rachel] Of course
he knows Batman.

33:21.739 --> 33:24.208
Are we gonna see him? Uh...

33:24.241 --> 33:26.978
I'd really like
to meet Batman.

33:27.010 --> 33:28.578
No, you're not.

33:28.612 --> 33:30.448
[Kory] Any luck?

33:30.481 --> 33:32.250
I'm gonna find out
who's running
this freak show.

33:32.282 --> 33:34.152
Yeah, I'll come with you.

33:34.184 --> 33:35.787
They'll kill any cops
who try to handle them.

33:35.820 --> 33:37.688
Oh, I know what to do
with them, all right.

33:37.721 --> 33:39.824
Kory, no killing.

33:39.856 --> 33:41.224
Please. There's been enough.

33:41.259 --> 33:42.893
I thought
we weren't splitting up.

33:42.926 --> 33:45.061
I'm coming back.

33:45.096 --> 33:47.765
I promise.

33:47.798 --> 33:51.998
-Keep them safe.
-Of course.

34:00.178 --> 34:04.377
[sirens wailing in distance]

34:41.085 --> 34:43.034
Butterscotch?

34:47.557 --> 34:48.791
Thank you.

34:48.826 --> 34:52.726
You're very welcome, dear.

35:15.985 --> 35:19.155
I think we got in trouble.

35:19.190 --> 35:20.539
[beeping]

35:28.432 --> 35:29.967
Nap time, kids.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.969
[beeping faster]

35:32.001 --> 35:33.652
[explosion]

35:38.175 --> 35:40.510
Oh, shit.

35:40.545 --> 35:45.248
Dick's gonna think I did it.

35:45.282 --> 35:47.682
[elevator dings]

36:13.043 --> 36:16.713
[food sizzling]

36:16.746 --> 36:18.847
[glass clinks]

36:25.489 --> 36:27.391
Detective Grayson.

36:27.425 --> 36:29.994
Are you Mr. Adamson?

36:30.027 --> 36:34.699
Dr. Adamson.
Are you hungry? I've got
something on the stove.

36:34.733 --> 36:37.235
You're not a vegetarian,
are you?

36:37.268 --> 36:38.869
I do prefer
an animal-based protein.

36:38.903 --> 36:42.972
Who are you people,
and what do you
want with Rachel?

36:43.007 --> 36:44.576
As much as I'd love to have

36:44.608 --> 36:48.579
a lengthy conversation
with you about
Rachel Roth, Detective,

36:48.612 --> 36:52.115
I'm afraid there's no time.

36:52.148 --> 36:54.318
You found me.

36:54.351 --> 36:57.688
I've been exposed.

36:57.722 --> 37:01.458
So the organization
is sending people to kill us.

37:01.492 --> 37:05.295
We have one minute.

37:05.329 --> 37:07.831
Unless we leave right now.

37:07.865 --> 37:12.369
Or we could stay
for one last glass
of champagne.

37:12.402 --> 37:14.704
No one knows I'm here.

37:14.737 --> 37:17.141
I do.

37:17.173 --> 37:20.911
So does
the old woman downstairs.

37:20.945 --> 37:23.795
They're everywhere.

37:26.751 --> 37:29.686
Does this organization
work for Rachel's father?

37:29.721 --> 37:33.224
Is he still looking for her?

37:33.257 --> 37:36.159
You could say that, yes.

37:36.193 --> 37:37.494
[food searing]

37:37.527 --> 37:41.233
Oh, dear,
my crepes are burning.

37:41.266 --> 37:43.601
If you don't give me
some answers, I'm gonna
stick your face in it.

37:43.635 --> 37:45.237
I'm sorry, Detective,

37:45.269 --> 37:48.672
but we have ten seconds
before the final answers
come for both of us.

37:48.706 --> 37:50.106
What do you want
with Rachel?

37:50.141 --> 37:51.842
I do love a good champagne.

37:51.875 --> 37:53.143
I want some answers.

37:53.177 --> 37:56.514
Five, four, three...

37:56.547 --> 37:58.282
Okay, you're coming with me.

37:58.315 --> 38:01.452
-One.

38:38.456 --> 38:41.458
Wow.
Dick Grayson in the flesh.

38:41.492 --> 38:43.092
Nice to meet you, bro.

38:43.126 --> 38:45.827
I'm the new Robin.

38:51.668 --> 38:53.871
