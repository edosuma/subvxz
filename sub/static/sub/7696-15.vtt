01:55.406 --> 01:57.450
Ew! P.U.!

01:58.326 --> 02:00.828
Of all the disgusting...

02:09.378 --> 02:10.963
Hey!

02:11.839 --> 02:14.508
Look out, you crazy...

02:58.427 --> 02:59.428
Ouch!

03:01.889 --> 03:04.350
Rough night of crime-fighting, sir?

03:04.809 --> 03:05.851
Very.

03:05.976 --> 03:08.562
Well, you'll be happy to know
I've drawn you a bath.

03:08.979 --> 03:10.147
Whenever you're ready.

03:13.442 --> 03:14.777
What's the deal, Alfred?

03:15.486 --> 03:18.364
I said I "drew" you a bath, sir.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.908
April Fool's.

03:21.325 --> 03:24.745
Very funny, Alfred.
I guess I'll just take a shower.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.832
Not a funny bone in his entire body.

03:30.584 --> 03:32.878
Alfred, hit the radio, would you?

03:33.212 --> 03:34.547
Right away, sir.

03:35.214 --> 03:37.717
<i>Traffic is at a standstill
on the Gotham expressway</i>

03:37.800 --> 03:40.886
<i>where a trailer full of eggs
has overturned. This just in.</i>

03:41.762 --> 03:43.305
<i>The Gotham police are investigating</i>

03:43.389 --> 03:46.350
<i>a series of near-fatal accidents
along the riverfront.</i>

03:46.434 --> 03:49.061
<i>Initial reports indicate
that hundreds of Gothamites</i>

03:49.145 --> 03:52.398
<i>have inexplicably begun acting
like total laughing fools.</i>

03:53.190 --> 03:54.984
<i>More details as they become available.</i>

03:55.693 --> 03:58.446
Sounds like a rather
dirty April Fools' prank.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.407
Sounds like the Joker.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.987
<i>At this hour,
Gotham City is in the grip of insanity.</i>

04:40.070 --> 04:42.281
<i>Everywhere, people
are turning into lunatics.</i>

04:42.364 --> 04:44.992
<i>The latest reports say that the wave
of foolish hysteria</i>

04:45.117 --> 04:47.077
<i>is moving down 7th Avenue towards...</i>

04:47.953 --> 04:49.997
<i>Towards the financial district.</i>

04:56.045 --> 04:57.630
That's my cue.

05:13.020 --> 05:15.856
Uh-huh. Hmm...

05:18.234 --> 05:20.402
Perfect.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.870
Now, everybody,
remember where we parked.

05:34.041 --> 05:38.087
When the going gets tough,
the tough go shopping.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.101
Who says crime doesn't pay?

06:54.413 --> 06:58.250
Now, this is what I call
a sidewalk sale.

07:08.385 --> 07:10.054
<i>Airborne gas emanating</i>

07:10.137 --> 07:11.388
<i>from riverfront district.</i>

07:11.472 --> 07:16.685
<i>Analysis, lengthy exposure to the gas
will result in permanent insanity.</i>

07:20.814 --> 07:24.109
Alfred, I left
the hex key upstairs in the den.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.402
Would you bring it down?

07:25.569 --> 07:30.074
Oh, go <i>fetch</i> it <i>yourself.</i>

07:30.741 --> 07:33.494
Very funny, Alfred,
but I've no time to play.

07:34.912 --> 07:37.039
Alfred? Alfred!

07:50.344 --> 07:53.097
Just a little spring cleaning, sir.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.729
The gas!

08:09.363 --> 08:10.364
Oh!

08:21.458 --> 08:25.004
I believe I've contracted
a giant case of the giggles.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.260
<i>Lengthy exposure to the gas</i>

08:31.343 --> 08:33.470
<i>will result in permanent insanity.</i>

08:51.864 --> 08:54.908
Okay, let's shoot it.
This place is giving me the creeps.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.452
I'm here in downtown Gotham

08:56.535 --> 08:59.455
where corporate CEOs
have gone stark raving mad.

08:59.538 --> 09:03.250
It would appear that the collapse
of the stock market is now imminent.

09:03.375 --> 09:04.418
<i>The question is,</i>

09:04.543 --> 09:08.464
<i>Will April Fools' Day mark the end
of Gotham City as we know it?</i>

09:09.173 --> 09:13.761
The only things gaining now
are the laughing stocks.

09:32.946 --> 09:35.657
Huh? Ah!

10:02.684 --> 10:05.979
Look who's come to trash the place.

10:06.271 --> 10:08.440
A fitting setting for you, Joker.

10:08.690 --> 10:12.027
Ooh, I just love to get down and dirty.

10:12.694 --> 10:14.613
Okay, boys,

10:14.696 --> 10:16.532
it's playtime!

10:17.991 --> 10:19.493
It's about time.

10:19.701 --> 10:21.537
What are we waiting for?

10:39.096 --> 10:43.225
Batman, you're a real party pooper.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.854
Why don't you take your mask off
and have a few laughs?

10:48.939 --> 10:50.774
Cut the clowning, Joker.

11:00.075 --> 11:01.285
Get him.

11:11.044 --> 11:15.966
Tsk-tsk. You shouldn't have made
Captain Clown mad.

11:20.929 --> 11:23.098
Time to take out the garbage!

11:32.524 --> 11:36.111
I just love these new Ziploc seals.

11:36.445 --> 11:41.241
We wouldn't want our little
caged rodent to suffocate,

11:41.325 --> 11:44.870
so we'll just punch some air holes.

11:51.126 --> 11:54.796
Okay, Captain, give it the old heave-ho.

12:10.062 --> 12:15.984
Oops! Looks like our air holes
are water holes too.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.986
What a shame!

12:43.136 --> 12:46.807
I never knew Batman could sink so low.

12:47.099 --> 12:51.436
Well, Captain, this could be the start
of a beautiful friendship.

14:15.103 --> 14:17.189
You want to play dirty, Joker?

14:24.571 --> 14:28.825
Get ready, boys. Here it comes.

14:30.827 --> 14:37.709
This will give those April fools
a lot more smiles per gallon.

14:53.517 --> 14:56.520
What are you fools... Batman!

15:59.791 --> 16:01.585
Hey, Batman!

16:02.961 --> 16:07.299
Looks like Captain Clown
is really getting attached to you.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.638
You killed Captain Clown.

16:55.263 --> 16:57.974
You killed Captain Clown!

16:58.767 --> 17:01.144
Just for that, Batman...

17:12.447 --> 17:14.699
Hey, Batman,

17:14.950 --> 17:18.912
you stink so bad
I can smell you from here!

17:20.121 --> 17:21.540
P-U-!

17:23.333 --> 17:24.960
Pyew, pyew, pyew!

19:14.736 --> 19:18.990
Yee-haw!

19:37.634 --> 19:40.470
Justice is served hot, Batman!

19:41.054 --> 19:45.809
You're going to melt
just like a grilled cheese sandwich.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.795
Justice will be served, Joker.

20:13.878 --> 20:15.755
Service with a smile?

20:18.800 --> 20:20.885
Clean up your act, Joker.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.305
Oh, that's a joke, right?

20:24.681 --> 20:27.100
Batman finally told a joke.

20:48.121 --> 20:52.876
Batman! You wouldn't let me fry,
would you?

20:55.712 --> 20:57.255
Batman!

21:12.854 --> 21:16.107
I've taken eight showers
and I still feel soiled.

21:16.232 --> 21:18.860
Ugh! I've never seen so much garbage.

21:20.278 --> 21:22.822
What's wrong, Alfred?
Aren't you feeling better?

21:22.906 --> 21:24.783
"What's wrong," sir?

21:25.366 --> 21:29.829
I destroy a priceless Ming vase,
and you ask me what's wrong?

21:31.623 --> 21:33.082
Don't worry about it.

21:33.166 --> 21:36.044
I'll just take it out of your salary
for the next couple of years.

21:40.298 --> 21:41.758
Very well, sir.

21:44.594 --> 21:45.804
Alfred.

21:46.513 --> 21:49.474
April Fool's.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.505
