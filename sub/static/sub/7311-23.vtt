WEBVTT

00:02.818 --> 00:04.677
Los Angeles, OSP.
They have the lead.

00:04.737 --> 00:06.908
NCIS's Office of Special Projects.

00:06.996 --> 00:09.555
They specialize
in undercover and surveillance.

00:09.657 --> 00:11.203
Macy still agent in charge there?

00:11.284 --> 00:13.164
- How are you, Callen?
- Did you see Mace?

00:13.245 --> 00:14.957
- Yeah, I saw her.
- Let me do my job.

00:15.118 --> 00:16.918
Like you did the first time we met?

00:17.583 --> 00:18.583
Kickoff's in 30.

00:18.625 --> 00:20.495
Guy on the right, Michael Rivkin.

00:20.710 --> 00:23.087
When he called the other day,
I thought he must have been here.

00:23.111 --> 00:25.634
No. Sadly, Michael is not here.

00:25.716 --> 00:27.386
Go tight on Liam.
What do you see?

00:27.467 --> 00:28.554
He's carrying...

00:30.060 --> 00:32.850
Liam Coyle, former IRA arms dealer.

00:32.930 --> 00:33.930
Motel.

00:34.807 --> 00:36.436
Four blank passports.

00:36.517 --> 00:38.428
Four suitcases filled with weapons.

00:38.494 --> 00:41.494
That means whoever Liam's supplying is
probably coming back to collect this.

00:41.552 --> 00:43.325
Looks like you're going
undercover as Liam.

00:43.385 --> 00:46.030
- Been expecting you.
- It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

00:48.487 --> 00:49.873
You have everything I want?

00:49.933 --> 00:50.983
Times four.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.200
Passports?

00:52.705 --> 00:53.705
Everything.

00:53.919 --> 00:55.116
And it's all here?

00:55.808 --> 00:56.999
It's all here.

00:58.332 --> 01:00.962
First the face, next the name.

01:07.058 --> 01:09.846
You know, I met a man in Damascus
who said you were dead.

01:10.882 --> 01:13.724
Well, let me know when he passes.
I'll come to his funeral.

01:14.063 --> 01:15.063
Too late.

01:16.918 --> 01:18.845
- Who are you?
- Abort, abort.

01:18.905 --> 01:20.940
Target center of the room,
weapon drawn.

01:21.226 --> 01:22.650
Federal agents! Don't move!

01:23.160 --> 01:24.568
Put down your weapon.

01:24.686 --> 01:25.862
Put it down!

01:26.927 --> 01:29.073
Come on, Mace,
he wasn't gonna shoot me!

01:30.111 --> 01:31.689
Tell her you weren't gonna shoot me?

01:31.749 --> 01:33.161
I wasn't going to shoot him.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.622
No tension in the upper body,
and the voice is all wrong.

01:36.702 --> 01:38.293
Probably wasn't gonna shoot him.

01:38.702 --> 01:41.302
- Be embarrassing if he had.
- There's no room for probably, Nate.

01:41.909 --> 01:43.059
Do we have a name?

01:43.998 --> 01:46.382
Well, we just started.
It's gonna take at least a...

01:48.131 --> 01:50.219
- We got a match here.
- Put it on the screen.

01:50.300 --> 01:53.347
Millions of possibilities,
we get a hit in six seconds?

01:55.930 --> 01:57.018
Michael Rivkin.

01:57.664 --> 01:59.019
His name's Michael Rivkin.

01:59.624 --> 02:00.624
FBI?

02:03.314 --> 02:04.314
CIA?

02:05.030 --> 02:06.030
NCIS.

02:06.108 --> 02:08.068
He's way too confident.

02:08.151 --> 02:09.851
Think we're about to go pear-shaped.

02:11.001 --> 02:12.001
Who are you?

02:12.591 --> 02:13.591
Mossad.

02:13.876 --> 02:14.993
You can prove that?

02:15.312 --> 02:17.705
No, but I know someone who can.

02:18.689 --> 02:20.374
Her name is Ziva David.

02:26.419 --> 02:30.241
NCIS Season 6 Episode 23
Legend Part 2 V1.0 LOL.

02:31.549 --> 02:32.762
Synchro: Gaillots.

02:34.051 --> 02:35.723
Rereading: Bruno.

03:03.994 --> 03:04.994
Morning.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.408
- Something up?
- Gibbs.

03:08.582 --> 03:10.132
- He's back?
- MTAC.

03:10.212 --> 03:12.301
Nice, three one-word answers.
Wanna go for a fourth?

03:12.361 --> 03:13.072
No!

03:13.132 --> 03:15.346
Now I'm gonna ask you a question
that's gonna demand

03:15.426 --> 03:16.798
more than a one-word answer.

03:16.858 --> 03:18.557
- Are you ready for that?
- No.

03:19.973 --> 03:22.442
All right, here comes the question.
Ready?

03:22.944 --> 03:25.398
No beverage is allowed in MTAC.

03:25.479 --> 03:28.609
Hey. Soy vanilla latte, no sugar added.
Didn't blow back.

03:28.689 --> 03:29.689
It's all yours.

03:29.714 --> 03:32.754
God, question was right on the tip of
my tongue, and now I can't remember it.

03:32.955 --> 03:34.519
How could I forget the question?

03:36.901 --> 03:39.653
Questions are of course,
well, they're relative.

03:39.904 --> 03:42.144
- And I don't mean that in a sense of...
- OSP's on-line.

03:45.834 --> 03:46.990
McGee, put it up.

03:50.821 --> 03:52.133
You recognize him?

03:56.510 --> 03:59.049
Yes, I know him.
His name is Michael Rivkin.

03:59.763 --> 04:01.100
He says he's Mossad.

04:01.460 --> 04:02.934
Yes, he's with the Mossad.

04:03.524 --> 04:06.152
Anything else you can tell us about him,
Officer David?

04:06.212 --> 04:07.212
No.

04:07.395 --> 04:09.150
I have not worked
with him in some time.

04:09.882 --> 04:11.843
We will talk more about this later.

04:12.274 --> 04:13.274
Of course.

04:17.449 --> 04:19.457
You did not think
I would identify him.

04:19.517 --> 04:21.055
That was not a question.

04:21.116 --> 04:22.529
Anything you want to tell me?

04:22.589 --> 04:23.589
No.

04:23.811 --> 04:25.000
One-word answer.

04:25.327 --> 04:26.327
I win.

04:29.125 --> 04:30.671
His cover is an Israeli banker.

04:30.899 --> 04:33.507
Flew in three days ago.
That's all we got, still looking.

04:33.919 --> 04:35.589
What the hell is he doing here?

04:35.649 --> 04:36.968
Same thing we are.

04:37.050 --> 04:38.763
Tracking down a terrorist cell.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.145
We're hunting the same cell.

04:47.528 --> 04:49.315
Your search started here,

04:49.395 --> 04:50.455
mine in Yemen.

04:50.901 --> 04:53.861
Okay, well, if I'm Liam Coyle,
arms supplier, who does that make you?

04:54.526 --> 04:56.338
Nick Quaderi, jihadist.

04:56.398 --> 04:59.406
The real Liam's in the morgue.
Where exactly is the real Nick Quaderi?

04:59.466 --> 05:00.501
In bed.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.828
221 Pacific Avenue,

05:03.031 --> 05:04.955
Apartment 27, Venice Beach.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.916
No need to be quiet.
You won't wake him.

05:08.026 --> 05:11.212
You should've called us. Would've
spared you a long ride from Yemen.

05:12.091 --> 05:13.255
Need to be sure.

05:13.968 --> 05:15.406
What did Quaderi tell you?

05:15.466 --> 05:17.701
Weapons pickup here,
a man named Liam.

05:18.132 --> 05:19.479
- Target?
- No.

05:20.031 --> 05:21.138
Rest of the cell?

05:21.431 --> 05:22.807
Fell asleep before he told me.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.894
I can tell you
that one of the others is named Haziq.

05:26.975 --> 05:27.975
Address.

05:30.334 --> 05:31.357
That's all I have.

05:31.793 --> 05:33.317
Give him your cell, Sam.

05:35.530 --> 05:36.530
Be polite.

05:38.279 --> 05:39.323
Good morning.

05:39.404 --> 05:41.909
As I'm sure you're aware,
foreign intelligence agencies

05:41.990 --> 05:45.412
are not authorized to act
within U.S. territorial borders.

05:45.592 --> 05:48.199
I would hate for your actions
to cause an incident

05:48.409 --> 05:50.251
by staying here any longer,
Mr. Rivkin.

05:50.657 --> 05:51.961
We each have a job to do.

05:52.249 --> 05:53.657
Yours is done.

05:53.717 --> 05:54.717
Go home.

05:57.642 --> 05:59.092
GPS tracker on his rental.

05:59.281 --> 06:01.095
Sam, let him go.

06:12.019 --> 06:13.023
Yeah.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.779
Four passports, four suitcases.

06:19.218 --> 06:21.282
Yeah, Rivkin's already put
one of them to sleep.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.536
One down, three to go.

06:24.865 --> 06:26.782
Eric, give me outside surveillance.

06:27.451 --> 06:28.531
On screen.

06:30.507 --> 06:32.460
Agent Renko, you got him?

06:35.845 --> 06:37.145
I got him, Mace.

06:39.468 --> 06:42.428
Callen, Sam, Venice Beach,
Quaderi's apartment.

06:42.659 --> 06:43.659
Kensi,

06:43.776 --> 06:44.791
shut it down.

06:47.096 --> 06:49.322
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Mumbai.

06:49.533 --> 06:51.003
They attack soft targets.

06:51.973 --> 06:53.719
Hotels, a railway station.

06:55.096 --> 06:57.937
We need a breathing suspect,
not a dead one.

06:59.279 --> 07:00.785
That's not Rivkin's plan.

07:01.048 --> 07:02.647
We have to stay ahead of him

07:02.939 --> 07:06.033
until I get approval to lock him up
or send him home.

07:09.722 --> 07:12.041
Officer David was sent back
to Israel

07:12.121 --> 07:14.540
- last year.
- Are you asking me: Do I trust her?

07:14.600 --> 07:16.781
Because my answer is:
Yes, with my life.

07:19.379 --> 07:21.399
You don't think
I'm very good at this, do you?

07:23.488 --> 07:25.888
The director must
or you wouldn't be doing this job.

07:27.877 --> 07:30.562
You shouldn't judge me
on past performance.

07:31.181 --> 07:32.887
It was 18 years ago.

07:35.595 --> 07:36.937
What'd you find?

07:59.335 --> 08:00.519
Okay, so...

08:01.009 --> 08:02.666
Mossad gets a lead in Yemen

08:02.726 --> 08:05.503
about a terrorist cell operating out
of Los Angeles, right?

08:05.841 --> 08:07.734
Sends Rivkin to eliminate them.

08:08.289 --> 08:11.016
Rivkin finds one of the terrorists,
Nick Quaderi, kills him,

08:11.101 --> 08:12.559
but not before Quaderi mentions

08:12.619 --> 08:14.748
that he's meeting
with an arms dealer named Liam.

08:15.267 --> 08:18.107
And the only problem is,
we're hunting the same terrorist cell.

08:18.384 --> 08:20.368
Terrorist cells are like families.

08:20.428 --> 08:23.607
I mean, close-knit,
always checking on each other.

08:24.278 --> 08:26.718
Now, if they lost contact
with one of their own,

08:26.917 --> 08:29.034
it may trigger them
to step up the attack.

08:29.166 --> 08:31.829
Next move is to find
the cell member Rivkin mentioned.

08:32.354 --> 08:33.054
Haziq.

08:33.327 --> 08:34.631
Before he panics.

08:36.352 --> 08:38.991
You think that Rivkin knows
the identities of the rest of the cell?

08:40.131 --> 08:42.255
It was right there
in his smug smile, McGee.

08:42.640 --> 08:43.640
He knows.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.964
You okay, Mace?

08:57.605 --> 08:59.899
I already told you
not to go there, Nate.

09:01.622 --> 09:02.622
Well...

09:03.466 --> 09:04.612
you know me too well.

09:05.238 --> 09:06.769
No one knows you, Nate.

09:07.141 --> 09:11.133
You, on the other hand, being
the psychologist you are, know everyone.

09:12.479 --> 09:13.479
Not Gibbs.

09:16.370 --> 09:17.958
So you go back 18 years, huh?

09:20.237 --> 09:21.411
I wasn't listening.

09:25.041 --> 09:26.688
Odd word, occasional phrase.

09:30.668 --> 09:33.390
Gibbs was a gunnery sergeant.

09:33.945 --> 09:37.552
I was a green,
young lieutenant in the Military Police

09:37.886 --> 09:39.521
determined to prove myself.

09:39.708 --> 09:41.273
You worked a case together?

09:42.608 --> 09:43.902
You could say that.

09:44.610 --> 09:46.946
It was a JAGMAN investigation,

09:47.027 --> 09:48.027
a murder.

09:49.608 --> 09:51.255
I was the lead investigator.

09:51.947 --> 09:53.353
And... Gibbs?

09:56.546 --> 09:57.777
Gibbs was the suspect.

10:07.870 --> 10:09.292
Nick Quaderi.

10:09.628 --> 10:11.877
- Guy's a ghost.
- Definitely is now.

10:13.519 --> 10:17.382
We got his name and his address.
Paid his rent in cash, utilities paid

10:17.463 --> 10:20.927
by his landlord, so no photo
I.D. there, and no credit cards.

10:21.009 --> 10:23.569
You have any idea how many times
your average law-abiding citizen

10:23.609 --> 10:25.231
is recorded every week, McGee?

10:25.872 --> 10:28.251
Yeah, probably north of 3,000 times.

10:28.311 --> 10:31.272
Way north.
Like northern Alaska north.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.775
Every phone call, credit card
transaction, Internet search,

10:34.873 --> 10:36.915
all swallowed up
and stored on hard drives

10:36.975 --> 10:39.004
so people can troll them
for personal information.

10:39.064 --> 10:40.823
You mean,
like we're doing right now.

10:40.903 --> 10:43.034
Yeah, that's okay 'cause
we work for the government.

10:43.115 --> 10:45.273
We've got a national
security letter to prove it.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.283
This guy really did not want
to be found.

10:47.343 --> 10:48.831
Well, Rivkin found him, McGee.

10:49.711 --> 10:52.667
- Are you still tracking Rivkin?
- Yeah, boss, we got him right there.

10:52.749 --> 10:55.807
Marina Del Rey.
We're pulling up the pictometry now.

10:56.168 --> 10:58.332
His car's parked at a hotel.

10:58.587 --> 10:59.800
Special Agent Renko?

11:00.841 --> 11:03.679
He's out of his car
and he's got a visual.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.473
- Let him know I'm coming.
- I'm on it.

11:09.124 --> 11:10.476
You got something else?

11:12.311 --> 11:13.781
No, that about covers it.

11:40.799 --> 11:42.677
I lived in a place like this
when I was a kid.

11:42.758 --> 11:44.428
I probably lived down the hall.

11:45.926 --> 11:48.182
This is it. Apartment 27.

12:15.069 --> 12:17.673
Nick Quaderi,
if you're inclined to believe Rivkin.

12:21.566 --> 12:23.384
What is it between Mace and Gibbs?

12:24.066 --> 12:25.539
They've never told me.

12:25.941 --> 12:27.429
Think they'll work it out?

12:27.753 --> 12:29.047
Not without some help.

12:30.377 --> 12:32.226
One-inch tear.
Looks like a stab wound.

12:32.306 --> 12:34.729
Clean and quick under the sternum,
up into the heart.

12:37.068 --> 12:39.066
There's a secret department
in the Mossad

12:39.512 --> 12:42.547
called the Kidon. I had dealings
with them when I was a Seal.

12:43.306 --> 12:44.739
Highly trained, fearless.

12:44.943 --> 12:47.241
They were formed
after the war to track down Nazis.

12:47.322 --> 12:50.036
Now they come after all enemies
who would harm Israel.

12:51.755 --> 12:53.414
I think Rivkin could be one of them.

12:54.680 --> 12:55.680
Kidon?

12:56.687 --> 12:58.164
Hebrew for "bayonet".

13:08.259 --> 13:09.386
Morning, Mike.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.016
Help yourself.

13:15.570 --> 13:16.670
Where is he?

13:17.252 --> 13:19.960
Hotel gazebo,
having coffee at the middle table.

13:20.354 --> 13:22.320
Went inside, came back out
a couple minutes later.

13:22.380 --> 13:23.765
He's been there ever since.

13:24.693 --> 13:27.365
- He's waiting for somebody.
- That's my guess.

13:27.917 --> 13:29.283
Whose boat is this?

13:30.194 --> 13:31.444
I have no idea.

13:34.595 --> 13:37.041
Sand with the grain
of the wood, Renko.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.253
You done this before?

13:41.634 --> 13:42.634
Yeah.

13:49.383 --> 13:51.673
Download complete.
Rest in peace.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.212
If that's what you want, sure.

14:02.438 --> 14:03.809
Next week, then.

14:05.583 --> 14:06.686
Yeah, ciao.

14:08.199 --> 14:09.199
Hi.

14:09.322 --> 14:10.408
Who are you?

14:10.489 --> 14:12.743
My name's Liam.
I'm a friend of Nick's.

14:12.948 --> 14:14.495
Sort of. And you are?

14:14.761 --> 14:16.290
Shakira, his girlfriend...

14:16.447 --> 14:17.447
sort of.

14:19.199 --> 14:21.421
- Nick, I'm here!
- But Nick's not.

14:24.261 --> 14:25.672
Then how did you get in?

14:28.964 --> 14:31.345
He's supposed to meet me here,
but he's late.

14:31.425 --> 14:32.918
I was just gonna leave him a note.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.076
Liam.

14:37.102 --> 14:38.811
- You got a plan?
- Hey, Nick.

14:39.524 --> 14:40.271
Clever.

14:40.352 --> 14:42.523
I'm in your apartment waiting.
Where the hell are you?

14:42.604 --> 14:45.067
- I'm in the next room.
- Calm down, take it easy, all right?

14:45.290 --> 14:47.571
Hey, Shakira just walked in.
Do you want to talk with her?

14:47.691 --> 14:48.863
Not particularly.

14:49.777 --> 14:51.490
Okay, no problem.

14:51.749 --> 14:54.451
- What do you have in mind?
- Haziq's place?

14:56.337 --> 14:58.456
Sure, if that's what you want,
we'll come right over.

15:00.411 --> 15:01.959
He didn't want to talk on the phone.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.240
He wants us to come
to his friend's place...

15:04.952 --> 15:05.952
Haziq?

15:06.096 --> 15:07.798
- Do you know him?
- You don't?

15:08.353 --> 15:09.353
No.

15:10.262 --> 15:11.262
Lucky you.

15:11.675 --> 15:13.503
- I'll call a cab.
- My car's out front.

15:13.563 --> 15:14.563
Great.

15:14.729 --> 15:16.328
Is the bathroom through here?

15:26.621 --> 15:28.267
Rivkin gives us Haziq's name.

15:28.327 --> 15:30.196
She leads us to him. Stay close.

15:30.444 --> 15:31.988
How you gonna play this?

15:32.300 --> 15:34.996
I gotta believe Haziq still wants
what Liam's got.

15:35.516 --> 15:36.574
And if he doesn't?

15:37.828 --> 15:39.038
You come rescue me.

15:42.571 --> 15:44.030
You think she's involved?

15:46.041 --> 15:47.581
They're sleeping together.

15:47.641 --> 15:49.465
She's involved
whether she knows it or not.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.166
Yeah.

15:57.636 --> 16:00.143
- What kind of car do you drive?
- A convertible.

16:00.517 --> 16:01.964
Convertible? Red?

16:02.384 --> 16:04.404
- Yellow.
- I like yellow.

16:07.457 --> 16:09.144
- Mace?
- What's happening, Sam?

16:09.204 --> 16:10.733
Callen's back in the game.

16:39.393 --> 16:42.774
We're stopping at an auto shop
downtown... 13th and Bakers Lane.

16:42.834 --> 16:46.134
This place creeps me out,
or maybe it's just Haziq.

16:47.472 --> 16:48.740
Nick bring you here often?

16:48.883 --> 16:50.033
Couple times.

16:50.132 --> 16:51.760
Haziq was trying to recruit him.

16:51.820 --> 16:53.453
- For what?
- Hey,

16:55.571 --> 16:56.831
who's this?

16:56.891 --> 16:58.958
Nick's friend. He called.

16:59.277 --> 17:00.668
Told us to meet him out here.

17:01.198 --> 17:02.417
He didn't call me.

17:03.767 --> 17:05.001
Nick's friend, huh?

17:05.198 --> 17:06.198
Liam.

17:07.374 --> 17:09.448
What can Nick's friend do for us?

17:11.598 --> 17:13.450
I can give you
what you've been waiting for.

17:16.508 --> 17:18.843
Come in, Nick's friend.

17:26.107 --> 17:28.442
He's just met a guy, probably Haziq.

17:28.627 --> 17:30.827
I'm downloading photos.
I need some more eyes down here.

17:31.009 --> 17:32.834
Kensi's on her way.
Eric, live feeds?

17:32.894 --> 17:33.839
No coverage.

17:33.899 --> 17:35.870
Kensi, you're gonna have
to get a camera in there.

17:35.951 --> 17:37.330
I'll come up with something.

17:58.598 --> 18:01.104
You want to bang on something,
baby, you found your man.

18:02.162 --> 18:04.774
Hey, relax. We're cool, eh?

18:05.431 --> 18:06.431
Not today, boys.

18:07.982 --> 18:09.779
Have a nice day.

18:26.854 --> 18:29.095
Shakira,
bring our guest a cold drink.

18:34.620 --> 18:35.820
Are you armed?

18:36.691 --> 18:37.691
Back.

18:44.995 --> 18:46.045
Cell phone?

18:50.248 --> 18:52.864
- She doesn't know?
- Why should she? She's just a woman.

18:54.587 --> 18:56.945
Nick is not the one
who's supposed to contact you.

18:57.626 --> 19:00.374
He called me,
told me to come to his apartment.

19:00.434 --> 19:02.761
- Then he changed the meeting here.
- Why?

19:04.499 --> 19:07.002
You're just gonna have
to ask him when he gets here.

19:09.586 --> 19:11.367
- Thank you.
- Come and sit down.

19:21.389 --> 19:24.807
The cell phone you are trying to reach
is switched off or out of range.

19:24.867 --> 19:26.600
Please try again later.

19:28.123 --> 19:29.317
Where is Rafi?

19:29.761 --> 19:30.902
How would I know?

19:31.376 --> 19:33.905
He's your brother.
You should be more respectful.

20:02.135 --> 20:03.135
Sweet.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.229
Eric, activate Callen's cell phone.

20:06.378 --> 20:08.495
Microphone and camera coming online.

20:09.937 --> 20:12.218
Phone cam's up at Haziq's auto shop.

20:12.899 --> 20:13.736
Cell phone.

20:13.817 --> 20:16.322
Trace it, and feed it through
to Sam to translate.

20:18.821 --> 20:20.326
"I need you here, Nasim."

20:21.491 --> 20:22.912
"Is Rafi with you?"

20:24.744 --> 20:27.083
"What about Nick?
Have you heard from him?"

20:29.612 --> 20:31.345
"I'm not sure
if there's something wrong.

20:31.405 --> 20:33.210
Just get down here
as soon as you can."

20:35.134 --> 20:36.217
He's anxious.

20:36.826 --> 20:38.011
Feeling pressured.

20:38.331 --> 20:40.555
- Wants his men around him.
- He's not the only one.

20:40.690 --> 20:42.407
Director Vance
on the line for you, Mace.

20:42.722 --> 20:43.761
Where's Kensi?

20:44.158 --> 20:45.158
Director?

20:53.948 --> 20:56.486
Hey. A guy just backed into me.

20:56.824 --> 20:58.865
- Do you think you could possibly...
- We're closed.

20:59.278 --> 21:01.741
Come on, man, I just need
to know if it's safe to drive.

21:06.536 --> 21:07.795
You have a bathroom?

21:08.192 --> 21:09.192
No, we don't.

21:10.912 --> 21:12.962
This is not so bad.
You are safe.

21:13.043 --> 21:15.590
It's cosmetic damage.
Just bring it back next week.

21:15.973 --> 21:16.973
Okay.

21:18.156 --> 21:19.927
- Is Wednesday okay?
- Wednesday's fine.

21:22.570 --> 21:23.570
Thank you.

21:28.792 --> 21:30.313
Camera's inside the door.

21:41.070 --> 21:42.856
Pulling up the new camera angle.

21:43.944 --> 21:45.995
I understand, Director. I will.

21:46.203 --> 21:47.271
Good-bye.

21:48.119 --> 21:49.885
Traced the call Haziq just received.

21:49.945 --> 21:51.876
Caller's name is Nasim Boutros.

21:52.132 --> 21:54.128
Home address is a long-stay hotel,

21:54.209 --> 21:55.762
room 1122,

21:55.822 --> 21:57.590
at 73 Promenade Way, Marina Del Rey.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.343
Mace, that's the hotel
Rivkin is staking out.

22:00.545 --> 22:02.551
Where was Nasim
when he made that call?

22:04.818 --> 22:07.517
- Less than a half mile from the hotel.
- On his way home.

22:07.801 --> 22:09.519
And Rivkin is waiting for him.
Get Gibbs.

22:21.029 --> 22:22.539
- Yeah.
- Vance has cleared it

22:22.599 --> 22:25.039
with the Attorney General.
We have a FISA warrant. Get Rivkin.

22:25.406 --> 22:26.821
Go around back!

22:56.092 --> 22:58.213
- Gibbs!
- Yeah. Clear.

23:20.879 --> 23:22.955
Any idea what they're arguing about?

23:23.354 --> 23:24.693
Cell phone coverage.

23:24.802 --> 23:26.945
Haziq can't reach anyone
on his phone. And...

23:27.051 --> 23:30.227
Jumah's telling him
it's a piece of American junk.

23:34.675 --> 23:36.330
How did Nick sound on the phone?

23:38.738 --> 23:40.103
He sounded okay.

23:41.364 --> 23:43.244
They're planning something,
aren't they?

23:44.890 --> 23:47.238
If they use
what they're buying from me...

23:48.651 --> 23:49.651
yeah.

23:52.234 --> 23:54.114
Do you have any idea what it is?

23:55.199 --> 23:56.199
No.

23:56.437 --> 23:57.913
Change of plans.

23:58.375 --> 24:00.938
You are going to make
the weapons delivery today.

24:01.242 --> 24:02.456
- Here?
- Yes, here.

24:02.782 --> 24:04.316
Call whoever you need to call.

24:04.429 --> 24:06.944
You have an hour,
and then our business is done.

24:15.848 --> 24:17.913
- He's calling Sam.
- Hey, it's Liam.

24:18.992 --> 24:22.045
Bring the suitcases to the auto shop
at 13th and Baker's Lane in one hour.

24:22.348 --> 24:24.252
Okay, let's make it happen.
One hour.

24:24.365 --> 24:25.885
McGee, anything on Rivkin?

24:26.726 --> 24:29.674
No. GPS marker says he didn't leave
the hotel parking lot.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.245
He must have found
the GPS tracker and dumped it.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.096
Got a BOLO out on his rental.
Nothing yet.

24:34.176 --> 24:35.889
- Keep on it.
- Yes, ma'am.

24:57.049 --> 24:58.451
It's him. It's Tim.

24:58.700 --> 25:00.268
He knows I'm sitting at his desk.

25:00.738 --> 25:02.583
Tell him you're in your lab.
He won't know.

25:02.932 --> 25:05.513
- He'll know. He knows everything.
- Gibbs knows everything.

25:05.573 --> 25:07.629
McGenius is smart,
but he doesn't know everything.

25:08.806 --> 25:09.979
Hi, Tim.

25:10.631 --> 25:12.384
I'm not upstairs in the squad room.

25:12.465 --> 25:14.636
I'm in my lab. I'm working.

25:14.717 --> 25:15.998
Are you sitting at my desk?

25:17.775 --> 25:18.599
No.

25:18.679 --> 25:20.170
Abby, listen, last night,

25:20.230 --> 25:23.357
you did a facial recognition search
on Michael Rivkin. Why?

25:23.952 --> 25:25.481
What makes you think that?

25:25.685 --> 25:27.107
You logged the search.

25:27.310 --> 25:28.310
I did?

25:28.843 --> 25:29.843
I did.

25:31.935 --> 25:33.633
Did Tony ask you to do it?

25:35.621 --> 25:37.284
I'm not at liberty to say.

25:37.433 --> 25:39.410
- You are at my desk, aren't you?
- Yeah.

25:39.495 --> 25:41.288
- And Tony is watching you?
- Yeah.

25:42.245 --> 25:43.540
Can I talk to Tony, please?

25:43.621 --> 25:44.790
Okay. It's for you.

25:45.042 --> 25:46.460
It's McGoo... McGee... Tim.

25:46.643 --> 25:47.643
Sorry, McGee.

25:49.126 --> 25:51.500
Ignore her, Probie.
She's suffering Gibbs withdrawal.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.765
Transferring it onto you because
of a deep-seated fear

25:53.825 --> 25:56.887
that Gibbs may withhold love
and give her first-time head slap

25:56.967 --> 25:59.598
if he came back and saw
his desk festooned in balloons

25:59.678 --> 26:01.475
and decorated like
some tacky tiki bar

26:01.704 --> 26:04.494
with messages of affection
written possibly in blood.

26:04.961 --> 26:06.522
She ain't missing you at all.

26:06.874 --> 26:09.197
In fact, I can't think
of a single person that's missing you.

26:09.221 --> 26:12.069
Well, I'll tell you who we're
all missing and that's Michael Rivkin.

26:13.668 --> 26:14.717
Define "missing".

26:15.139 --> 26:18.210
Two members of the terrorist cell
are dead after Rivkin paid them a visit,

26:18.270 --> 26:19.938
and now he's dropped out of sight.

26:21.670 --> 26:23.664
Do you think
that there is any chance Ziva...

26:23.745 --> 26:25.164
Don't ask that question.

26:25.246 --> 26:26.875
Well, Tony, someone has to ask it.

26:27.431 --> 26:28.725
I know, McGee.

26:29.777 --> 26:30.777
I know.

26:30.816 --> 26:31.926
Leave it to me.

26:32.323 --> 26:33.385
Here you go.

26:46.781 --> 26:47.854
Here's what we know.

26:47.935 --> 26:49.541
Nick Quaderi, dead.

26:49.601 --> 26:51.766
Almost certainly killed
by Michael Rivkin.

26:51.826 --> 26:54.084
Nationality, unknown.
Date of birth, unknown.

26:54.144 --> 26:56.237
Quaderi has a girlfriend, Shakira.

26:56.361 --> 26:58.508
Who has a brother, Rafi Zayd.

26:58.568 --> 27:01.488
No confirmed photo.
Moved back to Yemen when he was seven.

27:01.548 --> 27:04.121
No record of him returning to the U.S.
Probably here illegally.

27:04.770 --> 27:08.041
Nasim Boutros,
stabbed by Rivkin at his hotel.

27:08.122 --> 27:10.419
American citizen, born in Syria.

27:10.479 --> 27:13.087
Immigrated here when he was 14.
Has a degree in engineering.

27:13.169 --> 27:14.403
No criminal record.

27:15.170 --> 27:17.592
First name... Jumah.
Last name... unknown.

27:17.673 --> 27:20.416
Looks like he works at the auto shop,
but he's not listed

27:20.476 --> 27:23.015
as an employee with the IRS.
Possibly here illegally.

27:23.345 --> 27:24.850
And finally, Haziq Khaleel.

27:24.931 --> 27:28.437
Born in Syria. Immigrated 12 years ago.
Owns the auto shop.

27:28.551 --> 27:31.022
Pays his taxes,
and has no criminal record.

27:31.921 --> 27:34.985
Five men,
all born outside the United States.

27:35.771 --> 27:37.651
Very few personal details,

27:38.059 --> 27:39.488
no criminal activity.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.283
Not on anyone's watch list.

27:41.614 --> 27:43.200
It's a classic sleeper cell.

27:43.282 --> 27:45.203
Rivkin's making sure
none of them wake up.

27:45.619 --> 27:46.714
Five people.

27:46.993 --> 27:49.541
Four passports, four suitcases.
Something's missing.

27:50.145 --> 27:52.121
Then number five is the handler.

27:52.678 --> 27:53.804
Maybe Haziq?

27:53.864 --> 27:56.297
No, Haziq's an alpha male.

27:56.379 --> 27:58.133
A physical, take-charge kind of guy.

27:58.238 --> 27:59.839
Aggressive, angry.

28:00.225 --> 28:01.677
Handlers are more refined.

28:01.894 --> 28:03.899
Methodical planners, smooth talkers.

28:03.959 --> 28:05.805
They know how to get
under people's skin.

28:05.865 --> 28:08.351
You know, make 'em feel
things and do things, and...

28:10.989 --> 28:12.147
You get the idea.

28:12.991 --> 28:14.049
If it's not Haziq?

28:14.255 --> 28:16.485
Well, Shakira's brother
Rafi's too young.

28:16.566 --> 28:19.154
Wouldn't have the respect of the others
who all seem to be older.

28:19.623 --> 28:22.486
- Then that leaves Nick Quaderi.
- Yeah, but according to Rafi's sister,

28:22.546 --> 28:24.086
Nick Quaderi didn't know any of them

28:24.146 --> 28:26.023
till her brother
introduced him to Haziq.

28:26.978 --> 28:28.542
Then we're missing something.

28:28.834 --> 28:29.834
Yep.

28:30.059 --> 28:31.075
Or someone.

28:39.330 --> 28:40.330
What did I miss?

28:40.381 --> 28:42.677
Abby playing with crayons,
possibly blood.

28:42.757 --> 28:44.823
McGee calling.
And I made a paper airplane

28:44.883 --> 28:47.724
that was so fantastic
it broke the office gliding record.

28:47.805 --> 28:50.057
But really all the fun's happening
in another area code.

28:50.117 --> 28:51.525
Are we... fighting?

28:51.585 --> 28:53.563
If we were,
you would be on the floor bleeding.

28:54.367 --> 28:57.401
Okay, I accept that as a likely outcome.
So you're just annoyed with me?

28:58.869 --> 28:59.869
Angry?

29:00.528 --> 29:03.073
- You should not be surprised.
- Because of this morning?

29:03.153 --> 29:06.451
You thought I would not identify
Michael Rivkin as a Mossad operative.

29:06.806 --> 29:08.807
- I didn't say a word.
- You did not have to.

29:08.867 --> 29:10.622
So you think you did
the right thing?

29:10.807 --> 29:12.013
You think I didn't?

29:13.216 --> 29:15.001
Maybe
you should have told them more.

29:16.812 --> 29:18.521
Like how well you know him.

29:19.041 --> 29:21.049
How well do I know him, Tony?

29:21.463 --> 29:23.369
You know him better
than they think you do.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.561
And you know that how?

29:24.621 --> 29:26.805
You saw him when he was in D.C.
three days ago.

29:27.058 --> 29:30.218
You didn't tell when you had the chance.
And I'm just wondering why, that's all.

29:32.182 --> 29:34.426
Are you, by any chance,
questioning my loyalty?

29:34.933 --> 29:38.511
I'm questioning why you didn't tell them
you saw him three days ago.

29:39.935 --> 29:41.235
Are you jealous?

29:42.576 --> 29:43.576
No.

29:43.994 --> 29:45.022
I'm worried.

29:45.395 --> 29:48.373
Because you don't seem to understand
that your secret friend is interfering

29:48.433 --> 29:51.906
with this agency's ability
to shut down a terrorist cell.

29:52.268 --> 29:53.915
Interfering? How is he interfering?

29:53.995 --> 29:55.500
He's already killed two suspects.

29:55.581 --> 29:58.003
Well, in my country
that would be cause for celebration.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.559
You're not in your country,
and neither is he!

30:01.748 --> 30:02.806
Have you finished?

30:03.631 --> 30:04.445
Yes.

30:04.589 --> 30:05.589
Good.

30:05.616 --> 30:06.616
No.

30:07.497 --> 30:08.497
Another question.

30:08.867 --> 30:11.099
- You know where we can find him?
- No, I don't.

30:12.473 --> 30:14.609
And if you did, would you tell me?

30:16.436 --> 30:17.436
No.

30:19.823 --> 30:21.101
But I would tell Gibbs.

30:26.486 --> 30:29.626
I tried to stop my brother Rafi
from getting involved with them.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.952
Now he's dragged Nick into it.

30:33.563 --> 30:35.138
How long have you known him?

30:35.668 --> 30:36.905
Three months.

30:38.331 --> 30:41.615
He travels a lot. I don't get to see him
as much as I wanted.

30:43.626 --> 30:46.149
At first Rafi didn't want me
to see him at all, but...

30:46.443 --> 30:47.564
Nick was patient.

30:48.451 --> 30:50.030
Now, they're like brothers.

30:52.428 --> 30:54.075
I've never met Rafi.

30:55.113 --> 30:56.728
You don't have any photos, do you?

30:57.440 --> 30:58.440
Of course.

31:03.523 --> 31:04.716
Nick took it.

31:13.222 --> 31:16.200
And you've probably got tons
of photos of Nick in there, huh?

31:16.654 --> 31:18.625
Nick's so camera shy, it's crazy.

31:18.879 --> 31:20.418
Hard to believe, but...

31:20.740 --> 31:22.269
this is the only photo I have.

31:35.879 --> 31:37.434
Eric, talk to me.

31:37.698 --> 31:39.644
- Have we lost audio?
- They're whispering, Mace.

31:39.751 --> 31:41.367
- Who's whispering?
- Everybody.

31:41.427 --> 31:43.258
Why the hell are they whispering?

31:44.403 --> 31:46.277
- You ready?
- On your command, Mace.

31:49.193 --> 31:51.282
Stand by. If you were Rivkin,
where would you be?

31:54.698 --> 31:57.387
I wouldn't be far.
I'd want to finish the job.

31:57.447 --> 32:00.833
At our expense. If we're gonna find
their target and their support team,

32:00.914 --> 32:02.543
we need at least one of them alive.

32:03.716 --> 32:05.191
No, he doesn't think that way.

32:05.566 --> 32:08.424
- Where the hell are you going?
- Let you know when I get there.

32:18.131 --> 32:19.560
Come on, G, speak up!

32:25.278 --> 32:26.794
I need to contact Nick.

32:27.072 --> 32:28.944
You heard Haziq...
he's not answering.

32:29.193 --> 32:31.251
Well, I'm guessing he gave you
another number,

32:32.104 --> 32:34.074
in case something bad happened.

32:37.506 --> 32:39.673
Something bad is going to happen.

32:42.966 --> 32:44.600
You can't keep running away
from this,

32:44.660 --> 32:46.879
who they are,
what they're planning to do.

32:47.973 --> 32:49.935
Something bad's going
to happen to Nick?

32:51.630 --> 32:52.930
To your brother.

32:54.811 --> 32:55.811
Who are you?

32:56.434 --> 32:58.859
I'm someone you need
to trust right now.

33:02.683 --> 33:04.146
Okay, they've stopped whispering.

33:06.455 --> 33:08.994
I'm tired. I'm going home.
You can't keep me here.

33:10.797 --> 33:11.930
No one leaves.

33:12.276 --> 33:13.690
You can't stop me.

33:20.259 --> 33:21.747
Your friend better be on time.

33:31.145 --> 33:33.342
Promise me
nothing will happen to Rafi.

33:39.261 --> 33:40.311
Promise me.

33:42.071 --> 33:43.271
I promise you.

33:46.242 --> 33:47.600
Three-one-0...

33:47.759 --> 33:49.009
five-five-five...

33:49.197 --> 33:50.538
zero-one-three-zero.

33:54.197 --> 33:56.448
Nick Quaderi's real
name is Michael Rivkin.

33:57.060 --> 34:00.828
He can be contacted at 310-555-0130.

34:01.579 --> 34:04.498
I already have his number,
and I don't care what his real name is.

34:05.363 --> 34:06.363
Okay?

34:13.795 --> 34:16.592
- Searching for the number.
- Rivkin's been playing us all along.

34:16.884 --> 34:18.007
It's a cell phone.

34:18.068 --> 34:19.871
I need a GPS location now.

34:21.795 --> 34:23.851
Nick Quaderi's the name
Michael Rivkin used.

34:24.025 --> 34:27.438
He befriended Shakira so he could get
to know her brother Rafi.

34:27.518 --> 34:29.592
Won over the brother
to get invited into the cell.

34:30.387 --> 34:33.402
That means that the body Rivkin
told us was Quaderi is actually...

34:33.914 --> 34:34.987
Rafi Zayd,

34:35.303 --> 34:36.319
her brother.

34:37.661 --> 34:40.284
All right, we got Rivkin's location.
He's almost on top of him.

34:41.475 --> 34:43.245
Pass it on to the nearest team.

34:45.786 --> 34:47.172
I can't wait. Sam?

34:47.628 --> 34:49.793
- Game's yours.
- Okay, Mace. Moving in.

35:00.134 --> 35:01.317
Go, go, go!

35:01.426 --> 35:03.557
- Federal agents! Freeze!
- NCIS!

35:09.977 --> 35:11.749
Sam, I want him alive.

35:26.786 --> 35:28.040
- Clear!
- Clear!

35:28.121 --> 35:29.208
All clear!

35:30.372 --> 35:31.460
You'll live.

35:43.010 --> 35:44.093
Secured.

35:46.892 --> 35:47.892
Rivkin?

36:04.030 --> 36:05.077
I got him, McGee.

36:16.582 --> 36:17.671
You're Gibbs.

36:20.457 --> 36:21.868
Time for you to go home.

36:22.338 --> 36:23.338
Now.

36:23.896 --> 36:25.930
I don't like leaving
things unfinished.

36:26.415 --> 36:27.415
You're done.

36:27.793 --> 36:29.177
I'm finishing it for you.

36:30.571 --> 36:33.765
I leave, Washington
and Tel Aviv look the other way.

36:34.710 --> 36:36.062
That's not what I'd do.

36:37.351 --> 36:38.501
We fight the same war.

36:39.654 --> 36:41.451
Only ours began in Auschwitz.

36:42.957 --> 36:44.731
I have six million uniforms.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.333
- Every one is different.
- I got one.

36:58.954 --> 37:00.194
She works for me.

37:02.664 --> 37:03.664
Shalom.

37:36.431 --> 37:38.670
Guess
that drink's gonna have to wait.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.964
Well, my basement's always open.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.217
- It's good to see you, Jethro.
- Yeah.

37:46.884 --> 37:47.884
Stay low.

37:49.406 --> 37:51.330
- Red-eye, huh?
- Yeah.

37:55.955 --> 37:57.324
Always worked for me.

38:14.396 --> 38:15.396
Sorry.

38:16.966 --> 38:17.966
Thanks.

38:18.634 --> 38:19.888
No problem.

38:26.650 --> 38:27.850
Long day, huh?

38:28.092 --> 38:30.425
Yeah, yeah, long... day.

38:33.652 --> 38:35.534
Just getting some, uh, some air.

38:45.758 --> 38:46.758
Right.

38:48.945 --> 38:50.325
Agent Gibbs?

38:55.870 --> 38:57.124
Good to meet you, Nate.

38:57.318 --> 38:58.419
Likewise.

39:01.960 --> 39:02.960
I...

39:03.841 --> 39:06.491
I took an oath not to betray
confidences,

39:06.701 --> 39:07.701
but...

39:08.557 --> 39:11.160
I can't see any harm
in telling you a story.

39:12.477 --> 39:15.494
18 years ago, there was this young
lieutenant in the Military Police

39:15.554 --> 39:17.082
who investigated a murder.

39:17.636 --> 39:20.787
A Marine gunnery sergeant had taken out
this Mexican drug dealer

39:20.847 --> 39:22.566
who killed his family.

39:22.907 --> 39:25.991
The young lieutenant interrogated
the suspect, didn't hold back.

39:26.529 --> 39:28.517
He just wanted closure, and...

39:28.577 --> 39:31.482
she wouldn't leave his wife
and daughter to rest in peace.

39:33.070 --> 39:34.957
Kind of thing that stays with you.

39:36.370 --> 39:37.509
Anyway,

39:38.163 --> 39:40.673
she got all the evidence
together, and...

39:40.895 --> 39:42.002
then she buried it.

39:43.568 --> 39:44.775
Decided it was a...

39:45.319 --> 39:46.555
just killing.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.719
My guess is that the guy
never even knew

39:49.779 --> 39:52.077
that she'd been protecting him
all these years.

39:55.097 --> 39:56.097
Well...

39:57.086 --> 39:58.982
I think I had enough fresh air.

40:36.890 --> 40:38.352
Are you gonna get out?

40:39.482 --> 40:40.977
I think it's time to move.

40:41.711 --> 40:42.711
Again?

40:43.836 --> 40:45.607
That's 3 times
in the last 18 months.

40:45.922 --> 40:46.922
It's 4.

40:47.673 --> 40:48.817
I don't know, I...

40:50.036 --> 40:52.030
I just feel like
someone's watching me.

40:52.111 --> 40:54.324
It's probably that Russian girl
you told me about.

40:58.328 --> 40:59.704
You ever gonna settle down, G?

41:05.659 --> 41:06.659
One day.

41:30.697 --> 41:31.987
Crazy son of a...

41:39.282 --> 41:40.282
G!

41:54.317 --> 41:56.891
Come on, G.
Come on, G. Stay with me.

42:01.721 --> 42:04.246
Stay with me, G.
Don't do this to me, come on!

42:05.268 --> 42:06.563
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

42:06.667 --> 42:08.137
Ocean Front Road, Venice.

42:08.436 --> 42:10.068
Stay with me. Stay with me.

42:10.981 --> 42:12.478
Come on, buddy.

42:24.605 --> 42:25.855
I missed McGee.

42:26.416 --> 42:28.210
I would never have guessed that.

42:30.003 --> 42:31.880
Hey, you and Ziva want
to go get a drink?

42:32.586 --> 42:33.670
She is already gone.

42:33.730 --> 42:36.384
Did you do that secret thingy
I asked you to do?

42:36.541 --> 42:37.541
Yep.

42:38.669 --> 42:41.848
Rivkin flew out of Los Angeles today,
unescorted.

42:42.088 --> 42:43.197
Destination?

42:43.419 --> 42:44.419
Tel Aviv.

42:45.669 --> 42:46.727
With a stopover...

42:47.856 --> 42:48.856
in DC.
