00:05.361 --> 00:08.821
Geez, Gina, I can smell your perfume from the top of the stairs.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.184
I'm not wearing any perfume.

00:14.693 --> 00:16.798
The, uh, the bottle said "unisex."

00:18.826 --> 00:20.077
How are you this morning?

00:20.466 --> 00:23.637
I don't know. I'm a little frustrated about my career.

00:24.122 --> 00:26.417
I came out here a couple of months ago with all these goals

00:26.475 --> 00:27.787
and I haven't achieved any of them.

00:27.884 --> 00:28.713
Like what?

00:28.829 --> 00:30.792
I haven't been on the cover of a magazine.

00:31.062 --> 00:32.759
I haven't been nominated for an award.

00:33.101 --> 00:36.040
I haven't been on even one est Dressed" list. What's up with that?

00:38.029 --> 00:40.265
You were in a magazine. Last month you were in People.

00:40.397 --> 00:42.454
Unidentified male next to Nicole Kidman.

00:43.791 --> 00:45.769
Well, something good better happen for me soon.

00:45.863 --> 00:48.607
I want to feel like I made the right decision moving out here.

00:48.661 --> 00:50.667
Joey, why don't you do something about it?

00:50.822 --> 00:53.021
Yeah. Call your agent. Light a fire under her.

00:53.156 --> 00:57.573
Oh! Let me do it. I will rip her a...
No, no, no... I'll do it.

00:57.631 --> 01:00.862
But you're right. Yeah. I should call her. I need work.

01:01.267 --> 01:03.958
Not being on TV is even starting to affect my love life.

01:04.586 --> 01:05.512
- No.
- Yeah.

01:05.955 --> 01:09.149
Last night, I went out to meet a girl, you know, for sex?

01:11.126 --> 01:14.348
And I realized, when I moved out here, I lost a big part of my rap.

01:14.406 --> 01:17.591
I'm no longer...  "Joey Tribbiani, star of Days of Our Lives."

01:18.785 --> 01:20.622
Lines like that actually work?

01:20.741 --> 01:23.211
Well, not as good as your man perfume, but...

01:26.678 --> 01:29.084
You know, now that I don't have that, things are harder.

01:29.269 --> 01:31.692
You know, I gotta say, I hate to delight in this,

01:31.789 --> 01:34.490
but it's kind of nice that for once you're having a problem with women. I mean...

01:34.625 --> 01:36.274
Hey, Joey.

01:38.441 --> 01:40.933
- Thanks for a fun night.
- Oh, yeah.

01:41.197 --> 01:42.448
You take care.

01:47.493 --> 01:49.728
I said it was hard. I didn't say it was impossible.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.153 --> 02:31.499
Well, he's just walking in right now.

02:32.122 --> 02:33.500
I'll tell him.

02:33.801 --> 02:35.209
Great news, Joey.

02:35.421 --> 02:38.816
I just got you the lead in an industrial safety video!

02:41.027 --> 02:42.442
What?

02:43.140 --> 02:46.130
No, no, no, no, no. I don't want to do any more stuff like that.

02:46.207 --> 02:49.375
Look, Bobbie, I came to L.A. to take the next step in my career,

02:49.433 --> 02:51.190
and I feel like I'm taking a step back.

02:51.304 --> 02:54.190
You know, you got me doing these lame auditions, lousy commercials.

02:54.782 --> 02:58.023
That mystery theater thing at Ted Danson's house?

02:59.079 --> 03:01.312
I need things to change. Now.

03:01.595 --> 03:05.693
Ooh, there's the fiery Latin heartthrob that I took a chance on.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.315
I'm not Latin, I'm Italian.

03:10.117 --> 03:11.350
Italian?

03:11.977 --> 03:13.793
Oh, no!

03:15.387 --> 03:17.473
Italians are out this year.

03:18.565 --> 03:21.879
It may be time for you to call in your boy-band connections.

03:23.672 --> 03:25.699
I wasn't in a boy band.

03:25.863 --> 03:27.412
I can't catch a break.

03:29.601 --> 03:33.881
Look, Bobbie, you gotta do whatever it takes to get me something-- and something good.

03:34.299 --> 03:37.637
Otherwise I'm gonna go out and find someone else who will.

03:37.772 --> 03:38.943
Okay, look.

03:39.154 --> 03:40.728
Just give me one more chance.

03:41.026 --> 03:43.005
I will find you something.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.609
There's going to be no more celebrity parties, okay?

03:45.731 --> 03:47.442
No more cheesy commercials.

03:48.599 --> 03:53.134
Oh, and when you get home, just delete the message about emceeing the dog show.

03:54.527 --> 03:56.592
All right. Okay, that's more like it.

03:56.630 --> 03:58.347
Now, is there anything I can do on my end?

03:58.540 --> 04:01.200
Yeah. It'd be great if you had some connections.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.652
Who have you met in this business who's powerful?

04:04.825 --> 04:07.242
I mean, someone who loves you, someone you trust?

04:09.597 --> 04:11.019
Just you, I guess.

04:11.311 --> 04:12.765
Oh...

04:13.604 --> 04:15.822
You sweet thing, come here.

04:17.916 --> 04:21.853
Oh, God, I could slap a diaper on you and nurse you right now.

04:33.239 --> 04:35.435
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Alex.

04:35.627 --> 04:36.785
Uh... what's going on here?

04:36.862 --> 04:39.637
Oh, I'm hosting an alumni event for Northwestern University.

04:39.836 --> 04:42.397
No, no, I meant, there's no mustard for the pigs in the blanket.

04:43.563 --> 04:45.238
Where's your head at, girl?

04:46.961 --> 04:48.279
I'll take care of it.

04:48.318 --> 04:49.263
Hey, Alex.

04:49.533 --> 04:51.767
That guy looks familiar but I can't place him.

04:51.927 --> 04:53.914
Usually when I have that feeling it's someone I've slept with,

04:54.010 --> 04:55.580
but I don't think it's that.

04:56.792 --> 04:57.960
He's a movie producer.

04:58.018 --> 04:58.655
Ooh.

04:58.751 --> 05:00.099
Hey. Can you introduce me to him?

05:00.157 --> 05:02.395
My agent said I need to make some Hollywood connections.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.425
Oh, yeah. Sure. Hey, Steve!

05:05.740 --> 05:08.229
This is, uh, my friend, Joey Tribbiani. He's an actor.

05:08.306 --> 05:10.485
He just moved here from New York a couple months ago.

05:10.734 --> 05:11.949
Hey! Steve Carpenter, nice to meet you.

05:12.027 --> 05:12.914
Yeah, you, too.

05:12.972 --> 05:13.917
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:13.956 --> 05:17.240
there's a girl in there I hated in college and I'm now more successful than.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.428
So, Joey, you don't look familiar.

05:22.486 --> 05:23.586
Are you a Wildcat?

05:24.068 --> 05:26.929
Well, I don't like to brag about it, but I do okay.

05:28.844 --> 05:31.492
You can go ahead and brag. We're all proud we went to Northwestern.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.994
Go, Wildcats!

05:33.078 --> 05:34.120
Oh, I thought you meant...

05:34.197 --> 05:36.184
You know, you should come in and audition for me sometime.

05:36.416 --> 05:36.937
Really?

05:37.072 --> 05:39.023
Yeah, we like to look out for our own.

05:39.189 --> 05:41.304
That's  why they call us the Northwestern Mafia.

05:41.507 --> 05:45.497
We've got alumni at every studio, network, and major talent agency in this town.

05:46.330 --> 05:50.177
Then I am really glad I went there! Go, Wildcats!

05:51.230 --> 05:52.578
Say, what year did you graduate?

05:52.725 --> 05:54.990
Wait, let me guess. Uh... '91?

05:55.232 --> 05:56.248
W ow.

05:56.412 --> 05:59.273
Producer, or awesome year-guesser?

06:00.897 --> 06:04.775
Who do I know that was '91? Uh... Lance Beckman. Do you know Lance?

06:04.891 --> 06:06.373
- Uh, is he here?
- No.

06:06.587 --> 06:08.430
I was in his wedding!

06:09.422 --> 06:11.294
Well,  you know, if you're new in town,

06:11.371 --> 06:13.564
I should introduce you to the rest of the Northwestern Mafia.

06:14.084 --> 06:16.342
It's too bad-- I don't think there's anyone else here from '91.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.681
Oh, darn, that would have been a fun situation.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.423
Hey, guys, this is Joey.

06:26.652 --> 06:29.191
Joey, this is Dave. He's an executive at Universal.

06:29.621 --> 06:30.723
Mark's in television.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.875
And Paul is a feature director.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.869
Yeah, Joey's the Class of '91.

06:35.003 --> 06:36.547
Oh, yeah? What dorm were you in?

06:36.778 --> 06:40.081
Uh... a different one every night, if you know what I mean.

06:42.856 --> 06:44.090
So, what'd you study?

06:44.225 --> 06:46.940
Uh, uh... not much of anything, I'm afraid.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.781
Fight song time. Shall we?

06:52.384 --> 06:54.970
Spread far the fame of our fair name

06:55.355 --> 06:57.281
Go, Northwestern, win that game!

06:57.360 --> 06:58.460
And then we'll... Okay...

07:03.127 --> 07:04.156
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:07.533 --> 07:09.311
Where'd you get the Northwestern shirt?

07:09.424 --> 07:12.477
Oh, at an organizational meeting for next year's homecoming.

07:17.798 --> 07:18.473
Hello?

07:18.687 --> 07:19.574
Joey...

07:19.936 --> 07:21.345
I did it.

07:22.990 --> 07:25.428
I got you a huge audition for tomorrow.

07:25.718 --> 07:27.396
That was fast. What happened?

07:27.512 --> 07:31.101
Well, apparently your friend from Northwestern called the producer.

07:31.690 --> 07:34.255
And then the producer called me and offered you the audition.

07:34.566 --> 07:36.334
And I said, "Okay."

07:38.492 --> 07:40.804
That's great. Okay, well, what's it for?

07:41.002 --> 07:45.004
Well, it's a sexy new nighttime drama set in a mountain resort.

07:45.692 --> 07:47.569
It's called Deep Powder.

07:48.957 --> 07:51.438
It's Baywatch on skis,

07:52.821 --> 07:55.557
and it's the dumbest script I ever read.

07:56.396 --> 07:58.073
It's gonna be huge!

07:59.491 --> 08:00.440
All right!

08:00.519 --> 08:01.595
Yeah, I'm gonna have my assistant

08:01.777 --> 08:04.754
fax you the audition scene as soon as I get off the phone.

08:05.069 --> 08:07.140
Great, Bobbie. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.

08:07.990 --> 08:08.781
What was that about?

08:08.897 --> 08:10.853
I've got a huge audition for tomorrow.

08:11.044 --> 08:12.337
Oh, that's great. For what?

08:12.414 --> 08:15.636
It's a sexy nighttime drama set at a ski resort.

08:15.713 --> 08:17.769
- That sounds fantastic!
- Yeah!

08:17.924 --> 08:19.814
Oh my God, it's not on against J.A.G., is it?

08:21.197 --> 08:22.655
No, well, I don't know when it's going to be on.

08:22.694 --> 08:25.703
But this is definitely a part I can get, yeah.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.612
And it's all because I told that guy I went to Northwestern.

08:28.980 --> 08:30.327
Lying is awesome!

08:31.869 --> 08:32.969
Oh, I can't wait to see the script.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.397
Bobbie's going to fax it over right now.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.397
Hello? Stop calling here!

08:39.778 --> 08:44.293
Damn it, every time I'm expecting an important fax, this jerk prank calls me.

08:44.568 --> 08:45.745
- What does he say?
- Nothing!

08:45.822 --> 08:47.404
He just makes this annoying sound...

09:02.422 --> 09:05.614
- Did you go to Northwestern?
- Why, yes, I did.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.741
Well, I graduated from Purdue three years ago.

09:10.397 --> 09:13.833
- So?
- We're rival schools.

09:14.256 --> 09:16.595
Oh. Yeah. Grrr. I hate you.

09:18.909 --> 09:21.051
- Joey Tribbiani.
- Katie Harper.

09:21.499 --> 09:23.486
Yeah, listen, I've got this audition now,

09:23.506 --> 09:28.024
but maybe we can get together sometime and get to the bottom of this rivalry.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.359
Hmm. Maybe we can.

09:30.648 --> 09:33.407
Yeah, well, hey... why don't you give me a call sometime?

09:34.661 --> 09:37.333
- You have your number on a card?
- I do this a lot.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.585
But also, you are very special.

09:46.144 --> 09:47.880
Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani.

09:47.957 --> 09:50.427
I'm here to audition for the role of Langdon Powder,

09:50.504 --> 09:53.041
the sexy young snowboarder with the secret past.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.227
Now, I don't want to tell you to cancel the rest of your session,

09:55.324 --> 09:57.584
but I was born to play this role.

09:58.484 --> 10:00.147
You're not reading for Langdon.

10:00.396 --> 10:01.278
Huh?

10:01.499 --> 10:03.179
You're reading for Langdon's dad.

10:06.062 --> 10:07.648
Langdon's dad?!

10:08.477 --> 10:09.596
But I'm young and sexy.

10:09.673 --> 10:13.058
I'm not some old, gray-haired guy in a dumb-looking sweater.

10:14.799 --> 10:16.653
Hey, how you doing, buddy? Good luck on the audition.

10:25.859 --> 10:26.654
Hey.

10:26.890 --> 10:28.393
Hey. How did the audition go?

10:28.810 --> 10:31.057
I did the stupidest thing I've ever done.

10:31.584 --> 10:34.281
Come on, honey. Now we both know that is not true.

10:36.129 --> 10:37.905
Did they find out you didn't go to Northwestern?

10:38.111 --> 10:39.751
No, no, no, it's not that.

10:39.867 --> 10:42.592
I spent all this time preparing for the wrong role.

10:43.333 --> 10:44.452
You know, and they wouldn't even let me audition.

10:44.529 --> 10:46.574
And I would have been so great at it.

10:46.902 --> 10:49.217
"If thrashing's a crime, yo, lock me up

10:49.275 --> 10:52.420
"because I don't want to live in a world where I can't thrash to the extreme."

10:54.718 --> 10:56.439
- That is great.
- I know.

10:57.576 --> 10:59.235
So did you end up auditioning for the right part?

10:59.293 --> 11:01.221
No, it was for the father.

11:01.607 --> 11:04.003
I'm not old ough to play the father of a teenager.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.100
I had a teenager when I was your age.

11:06.399 --> 11:07.972
- But that's different.
- How?

11:09.472 --> 11:12.095
Look, I don't have time to pretend your life is okay. I have a problem.

11:15.187 --> 11:16.941
Joey, they called you in.

11:16.982 --> 11:19.458
I mean, you should just audition for the dad.

11:19.938 --> 11:21.813
Yeah, but I don't know if I can pull it off.

11:21.881 --> 11:24.582
I have all the heavy scenes with my kids in the show,

11:24.621 --> 11:25.991
and I don't know how to do that.

11:26.184 --> 11:28.325
Look, I know this isn't the kind of role you're used to doing,

11:28.383 --> 11:30.821
but you can't just give up because you're afraid to fail.

11:31.146 --> 11:32.911
And I don't think you're going to fail.

11:33.675 --> 11:34.466
Really?

11:35.778 --> 11:37.437
I hate doing this stuff to your face.

11:37.515 --> 11:38.942
Are you going to make me compliment you?

11:39.077 --> 11:40.190
I need it.

11:40.537 --> 11:41.784
Turn around.

11:45.197 --> 11:47.838
I have seen everything you have done, and you are a great actor.

11:48.096 --> 11:50.276
And on top of that, I know that you can play a dad

11:50.315 --> 11:52.397
because I've seen the way you are with Michael,

11:52.504 --> 11:54.280
and you're like a father to him.

11:59.659 --> 12:01.224
Thanks, Gina.

12:01.936 --> 12:03.546
Come here, give me a hug.

12:04.887 --> 12:06.669
God, you're such a girl.

12:13.711 --> 12:17.107
I've been meaning to make a contribution, but it keeps slipping my mind.

12:18.408 --> 12:22.085
Well,  yes, of course. I treasure my Northwestern experience.

12:22.456 --> 12:24.075
And I treasure mine.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.841
Now, if you're willing to pledge $1,000...

12:27.937 --> 12:28.651
Joey.

12:28.902 --> 12:31.231
- What are you doing?
- Oh, excuse me one second.

12:32.109 --> 12:36.026
Ma'am, can I call you back in a few minutes? I'm not able to speak freely.

12:36.527 --> 12:37.357
It's me.

12:39.267 --> 12:41.767
If you can hear this, wave your hand.

12:44.581 --> 12:47.154
Why are you calling me from my alumni association?

12:47.287 --> 12:50.489
Well, I didn't know it was you. The sheet says Alexis Garret.

12:50.528 --> 12:53.767
- That's my full name.
- Ooh. Sexy.

12:54.993 --> 12:57.953
Joey, why are you pretending like you went to Northwestern?

12:58.327 --> 13:02.233
Because your friend Steve thought I went there and he got me an audition.

13:02.421 --> 13:05.687
Now he's asking me to do all this alumni stuff. I can't say no.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.922
- But you're lying.
- Alex.

13:09.322 --> 13:13.611
Isn't doing whatever it takes to achieve your dreams what Northwestern's all about?

13:13.796 --> 13:15.008
No!

13:15.835 --> 13:18.769
Then what is it about? I have to give a speech at the next alumni dinner.

13:26.235 --> 13:27.429
- Hey.
- Hey, Howie.

13:28.083 --> 13:28.954
What are you doing?

13:29.068 --> 13:31.708
I've got a big audition later, so I'm just going over my lines.

13:32.318 --> 13:34.602
Can I help? I have acting experience.

13:35.050 --> 13:36.768
I was one of the Honeycomb kids.

13:39.476 --> 13:41.459
Sure. Okay. You have the first line.

13:48.237 --> 13:50.282
Did you have any lines in those Honeycomb commercials?

13:50.339 --> 13:51.651
No, I did not.

13:55.004 --> 13:59.017
Michael, listen, I'm leaving for my audition in a few minutes.

13:59.113 --> 14:00.386
Will you run through the lines with me?

14:00.618 --> 14:01.743
Sure. Yeah.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.852
What's the scene about?

14:03.949 --> 14:06.611
Uh, well, I'm being over-protective of my daughter

14:06.688 --> 14:10.189
because her mother died in an avalanche that I may or may not have caused.

14:11.361 --> 14:13.888
There's a great speech about it later where I curse the elements.

14:14.024 --> 14:16.900
"Damn you, mountain, bring her back!"

14:19.169 --> 14:20.964
-So I'm the daughter?
- Hmm.

14:21.179 --> 14:23.578
All right, do I have to read it with like a high, girly voice?

14:23.694 --> 14:24.176
No.

14:24.314 --> 14:24.970
- May I?
- No.

14:25.067 --> 14:28.475
Okay, um... All right, so...

14:29.566 --> 14:32.268
I could do it now. I want another shot.

14:33.438 --> 14:35.089
That's okay. Michael's already doing it.

14:35.243 --> 14:37.185
Can I be his understudy?

14:39.475 --> 14:40.939
- Sure.
- Great!

14:42.988 --> 14:43.837
"Hi, Daddy."

14:44.030 --> 14:46.187
"How are you doing? Is something the matter?

14:46.270 --> 14:48.334
"Why won't you let me go to Haley's sleepover party?"

14:48.744 --> 14:51.582
"Because there's a blizzard coming. You could get snowed in."

14:51.679 --> 14:53.280
"You don't have to worry about me so much.

14:53.454 --> 14:55.671
Look at me. I'm a big girl now."

14:56.888 --> 14:58.142
"I can see that.

14:58.277 --> 15:02.348
I bet your friends think it's pretty lame that your old man wants to hold on to you so tight."

15:06.575 --> 15:09.286
If I had functional tear ducts I'd be crying right now.

15:11.157 --> 15:12.881
Really? Was I good?

15:12.966 --> 15:15.609
Actually, I got a very strong dad vibe from you.

15:15.802 --> 15:18.724
Thanks, Michael. I got a strong little girl vibe from you.

15:20.393 --> 15:21.975
All right, thanks, you guys.

15:22.052 --> 15:24.445
I'm going to go get this part. I still got to go pick up your mom.

15:24.638 --> 15:26.837
She's coming with me for moral support.

15:27.074 --> 15:28.251
All right, wish me luck.

15:32.248 --> 15:35.393
Hi. My name's Thomas Wheeler. I'm here for my Northwestern alumni interview.

15:39.137 --> 15:43.225
The producer I met at Alex's asked me to interview this kid as a personal favor.

15:43.535 --> 15:44.892
I completely forgot.

15:45.557 --> 15:47.195
How are we going to get out of this?

15:54.224 --> 15:56.820
Hey, sorry about that. Come on in.

15:56.916 --> 15:58.035
Oh, thank you, sir.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.698
I brought a copy my high school transcript

16:00.775 --> 16:02.606
as well as a letter of recommendation from...

16:02.742 --> 16:04.189
Yeah, I'm kind of in a time cnch here.

16:04.227 --> 16:07.333
But you seem like a fine young man. I'm giving you my full recommendation.

16:07.623 --> 16:09.263
What...  what about all my questions?

16:09.311 --> 16:10.662
What about the English department?

16:10.797 --> 16:12.606
Is there a strong pre-law program?

16:13.914 --> 16:16.797
Uh... college isn't all about academics, Thomas.

16:17.445 --> 16:20.699
So why don't you hang out here and have a good time.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.343
That's kind of our motto at Northwestern.

16:22.478 --> 16:24.465
I thought it wasv Quaecumque Sunt Vera.

16:24.658 --> 16:26.361
No, no, we changed it.

16:36.933 --> 16:38.650
Okay, you go over your lines.

16:38.746 --> 16:40.482
I will take care of the competition.

16:42.447 --> 16:44.298
Hi. You reading for the role of Dad?

16:44.855 --> 16:45.527
Yeah?

16:45.874 --> 16:47.482
You like Jager? Huh?

16:50.276 --> 16:52.435
- Hey, Katie.
- Hey, Joey.

16:52.833 --> 16:54.234
It's good to see you again.

16:54.318 --> 16:55.669
Yeah, I was thinking about you.

16:55.707 --> 16:57.833
There's a Northwestern-Purdue game on this Saturday.

16:58.021 --> 17:01.426
- Mm, you want to come over?
- You read my mind.

17:02.266 --> 17:03.449
You like football?

17:03.739 --> 17:05.648
- No.
- Neither do I.

17:07.023 --> 17:09.319
Okay, I'll talk to you after my audition.

17:12.174 --> 17:14.932
Okay, thanks for your patience, everyone.

17:15.029 --> 17:16.704
We're going to start reading now.

17:17.112 --> 17:18.714
Oh, ma'am, I'm sorry,

17:18.810 --> 17:22.053
but we're not reading for the part of Angry Prostitute till tomorrow.

17:24.090 --> 17:26.025
Oh, I'm not an actress, but thank you.

17:28.820 --> 17:29.649
Okay, uh...

17:29.688 --> 17:31.019
Joey, we're ready for you now.

17:31.135 --> 17:33.618
And I'd like to introduce you to Katie Harper.

17:34.051 --> 17:35.306
You're going to be reading with her.

17:35.902 --> 17:38.584
Oh, uh, I thought the scene was with me and my daughter.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.653
That's right. We cast her in the part.

17:40.751 --> 17:43.075
We're going to see if you two have chemistry.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.463
I think we might.

17:54.029 --> 17:56.260
You can do this. She's your daughter.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.185
And you're going to jail.

18:01.378 --> 18:02.632
Whenever you're ready.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.677
Hi, Daddy.

18:05.678 --> 18:06.855
How you doing?

18:07.783 --> 18:08.806
I mean...

18:09.346 --> 18:12.025
How are you doing? Is everything all right?

18:12.226 --> 18:14.175
Why won't you let me go to Haley's sleepover party?

18:14.387 --> 18:18.151
Because there's a blizzard coming. You could get snowed in.

18:19.449 --> 18:21.205
You don't have to worry about me so much anymore.

18:21.533 --> 18:22.960
I mean, look at me.

18:23.153 --> 18:24.693
I'm a big girl now.

18:25.429 --> 18:27.059
I can see that.

18:28.604 --> 18:32.441
I-I-I bet your friends think it's pretty lame that your old man wants to...

18:33.689 --> 18:35.592
hold on to you so tight.

18:41.122 --> 18:43.189
I... I like it when you do that.

18:43.924 --> 18:47.970
You're my special... little girl.

18:50.298 --> 18:53.569
- I love you, Daddy.
- And I love you, too.

18:55.265 --> 18:57.503
Now come give Daddy a kiss.

18:58.219 --> 18:59.627
Okay, thank you.

19:00.846 --> 19:02.969
Please, never have a daughter.

19:07.900 --> 19:09.385
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Terrible.

19:09.559 --> 19:11.538
Why does my daughter have to be so hot?

19:11.775 --> 19:14.263
I told you I couldn't play a dad. Come on.

19:14.369 --> 19:15.083
No, no, no.

19:15.199 --> 19:17.205
You go back in there and try it again.

19:17.321 --> 19:19.829
I can't. I am too turned on by that girl.

19:19.906 --> 19:21.685
Joey, you are an actor. Act.

19:21.839 --> 19:24.041
But I can't stop thinking about sex.

19:24.216 --> 19:25.695
You want to stop thinking about sex?

19:30.725 --> 19:33.618
What the hell are you doing?! That's disgusting! You're my sister!

19:33.773 --> 19:34.795
And that is your daughter.

19:34.911 --> 19:36.784
That is even worse. Now you go back in there,

19:36.861 --> 19:39.203
and you ask if you can try again.

19:39.286 --> 19:41.101
Okay. Yeah, you're right.

19:41.499 --> 19:42.405
Thanks.

19:46.255 --> 19:47.898
- Hey.
- Hey. How'd it go?

19:47.975 --> 19:50.483
Joey sucked the first time, but then I, uh...

19:50.599 --> 19:53.417
Your mother helped me in a totally normal way.

19:54.163 --> 19:57.411
So you feel like it went pretty well, right?

19:57.817 --> 20:01.668
Wait a minute. What's that look on your face? You know something?

20:01.884 --> 20:03.824
What's the best news I could give you?

20:04.090 --> 20:06.260
Uh, they fixed the vending machine.

20:07.016 --> 20:09.640
Oh, we got a Ping-Pong table.

20:09.941 --> 20:12.950
Oh, no... Kool and the Gang got back together?

20:14.055 --> 20:17.045
Okay,  I'm going to have to try this a different way.

20:17.508 --> 20:20.885
Uh, you are Langdon Powder's dad.

20:21.877 --> 20:22.494
Who?

20:23.645 --> 20:25.054
You got the part!

20:25.401 --> 20:27.079
I got the par... I got the part?!

20:27.214 --> 20:29.317
I did it! I did it!

20:29.452 --> 20:32.045
- Congratulations.
- Oh, Joey, I'm so proud of you.

20:33.636 --> 20:35.542
Okay... but that's the last one.

20:40.826 --> 20:43.173
An all new Will & Grace is coming up next...

20:43.386 --> 20:44.763
right here on NBC!

20:48.106 --> 20:49.872
- Hey, Joey!
- Hey, Steve!

20:49.949 --> 20:51.233
How did that audition go?

20:51.354 --> 20:54.055
Great! Thanks so much fot setting that up. I got the part!

20:54.232 --> 20:58.559
- All right! Go Wild Cats!
- But not Purdue, we hate them!

20:59.496 --> 21:01.425
Wait a minute, I'm here with your buddy.

21:01.483 --> 21:03.890
Lance! Come here, you gotta see who this is!

21:06.330 --> 21:07.675
It's me, Lance Beckman!

21:09.705 --> 21:10.535
Joey.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.926
I was in your wedding.

21:13.158 --> 21:14.801
No, you weren't.

21:21.157 --> 21:23.678
Okay, look, Steve. I have something I have to tell you.

21:25.054 --> 21:27.216
This man is not Lance Beckman!
