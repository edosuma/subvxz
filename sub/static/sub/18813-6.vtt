WEBVTT

00:01.540 --> 00:02.440
- Previously, on
"Emerald City"...

00:03.370 --> 00:05.500
- I haven't seen our eastern
sister in years.

00:05.540 --> 00:08.480
If secrets were kept,
they were kept from me too.

00:08.510 --> 00:09.680
- What kind of magic is this?

00:09.710 --> 00:11.410
- Magic strong enough
to kill a witch.

00:12.450 --> 00:13.520
- What is it?

00:13.550 --> 00:15.620
- A bullet more powerful
than magic.

00:15.650 --> 00:17.360
- Sylvie, did you do this?

00:17.390 --> 00:19.630
- Can I count on you
to build my arsenal?

00:19.650 --> 00:21.420
How long have you been
ruling in his stead?

00:21.460 --> 00:22.900
- When The Beast Forever came,

00:22.920 --> 00:25.150
you left my kingdom to drown.

00:25.190 --> 00:28.890
I want to see Emerald City
laid to waste.

00:28.930 --> 00:31.240
- Your men were right about me.
I killed 'em.

00:31.270 --> 00:32.710
All of them.
- Do you know my mother?

00:32.729 --> 00:35.130
- Dorothy? You've come home.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.300
- I know much you've
invested in us,

01:05.330 --> 01:07.530
and it's paying off.

01:07.570 --> 01:09.240
- Dr. Andrews,
I was wondering...

01:09.270 --> 01:11.200
- We... yes.

01:11.240 --> 01:15.210
We can generate enough wind to
create clean, efficient energy.

01:58.620 --> 02:01.490
- Morning, Frank.
- Morning, Dr. Chapman.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.750
- Will you call me Karen,
for goodness sake?

02:03.790 --> 02:06.720
- You've busted your butt all
these years to earn that title.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.729
I'm gonna continue to
address you like that.

02:09.759 --> 02:11.630
Here you go.
- Oh.

02:11.670 --> 02:13.410
Well, aren't you
the gentlemen.

02:13.430 --> 02:15.330
- You never help me
with my lab coat.

02:15.370 --> 02:16.740
- Would you like
your own coat, Frank?

02:16.770 --> 02:19.640
- Karen?
- Oh.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.840
- Yeah.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.750
- Ah, well you do
so much around here,

02:24.780 --> 02:26.490
I don't see why not.

02:26.510 --> 02:28.340
Jane?

02:28.380 --> 02:30.680
- Okay, let's fire her up.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.490
- Let's put some energy
on the grid, shall we?

02:33.520 --> 02:36.020
- Frank?
- Yes?

02:36.060 --> 02:37.330
- Are you taking notes?

02:37.360 --> 02:38.730
- Always.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.600
- When we reach full power,
only hold a few seconds

02:41.630 --> 02:42.740
to minimize risk, understood?

02:42.760 --> 02:44.290
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.360
- Okay, let's have some fun.
Roberto?

02:46.400 --> 02:49.330
- Okay, safety off.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.830
- Smoke in the tube.

02:51.870 --> 02:53.770
And we got sheer conditions.

02:53.810 --> 02:54.810
Bring the heat, Roberto.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.610
- Opening vents.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.880
- It's consistent
with the last trial.

03:04.920 --> 03:08.430
Creating energy out of thin air.

03:08.460 --> 03:09.800
- How much?

03:09.820 --> 03:11.720
- Too much.
Backing her off.

03:13.430 --> 03:14.600
- Jane?

03:14.630 --> 03:15.600
Bring it down.

03:15.630 --> 03:16.670
- I'm trying.

03:18.870 --> 03:19.840
- It's not working.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.430
I'm locked out.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.770
- Heat shield's gonna melt.

03:33.450 --> 03:34.690
- I'm shutting it down manually.
- No!

03:34.720 --> 03:36.560
- No, Roberto!
- Just monitor me there.

03:36.580 --> 03:38.910
- Roberto, you can't...

03:41.960 --> 03:43.600
How hot is it in there?

03:43.620 --> 03:45.350
- 120 and climbing.

03:45.390 --> 03:48.120
- Maybe I could help.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.830
Let me get on the computer.
I'm sure I can help.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.710
- Ah!

03:58.170 --> 04:01.400
- Jane?
- Don't touch anything here.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.950
Oh, my God.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.510
- Override's not working.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.580
Roberto?

04:11.620 --> 04:12.760
- Roberto!

04:12.790 --> 04:14.590
- We've got to get him
out of here.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.880
- Answer me.

04:33.910 --> 04:36.920
How do you know my name?

04:38.510 --> 04:39.940
- I've known you since
the day you were born.

04:39.980 --> 04:44.380
Here. In Oz.

04:45.550 --> 04:47.980
I would never hurt you.

04:48.020 --> 04:50.620
- You've been trying to
kill me since I got here.

04:50.660 --> 04:53.200
- Yes, but how could I
know it was you?

04:53.230 --> 04:54.630
That you were no threat?

04:54.660 --> 04:55.820
- And what makes you
think I'm not?

04:55.860 --> 04:58.890
- Is that why you're here?
To kill me?

04:58.930 --> 05:01.630
To take me back home?

05:01.670 --> 05:06.510
Your mother wouldn't approve.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.540
I loved your mother very much.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.910
- You loved her?

05:12.950 --> 05:15.850
- And she...

05:15.880 --> 05:18.550
loved me.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.190
- For what purpose did you
butcher my men?

05:23.220 --> 05:24.950
Where did the tunnel
in Nimbo lead?

05:24.990 --> 05:27.990
- I've told you.

05:28.030 --> 05:32.440
The memory of it
is lost to me.

05:34.540 --> 05:36.980
- And you think torture
will see it returned?

05:37.000 --> 05:40.840
- I believe this is
what I deserve.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.650
- I, too,
did terrible things

05:47.680 --> 05:49.950
when I was a young man.

05:51.790 --> 05:53.790
A different man.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.020
But I wasn't tortured
for my sins.

05:56.060 --> 05:58.730
I was rewarded for them.

05:59.730 --> 06:01.870
My punishment...

06:01.900 --> 06:05.540
my punishment is
that I remember.

06:05.570 --> 06:08.770
As will you.

07:01.760 --> 07:05.600
- What else can you tell me
about my mother?

07:05.630 --> 07:07.100
- You could ask me
anything you want.

07:07.130 --> 07:09.030
I owe you that much.
- Stay back.

07:09.060 --> 07:12.600
- What?

07:12.630 --> 07:15.800
Just give me the gun, and I'll
answer all your questions.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.900
- No.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.910
- One bullet, then.
- A bullet?

07:22.940 --> 07:25.340
- One.

07:25.380 --> 07:28.620
As a gesture of trust.

07:38.730 --> 07:41.770
- One bullet.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.730
- It's how I'll
earn your trust.

07:46.770 --> 07:47.810
Eh.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.610
Stay back,
she's no threat!

07:49.640 --> 07:52.040
- I have a hole in my shoulder
that speaks otherwise.

07:52.070 --> 07:53.900
- She's my guest.

07:53.940 --> 07:57.670
I've extended
my friendship to her.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.780
- Please reconsider.

07:59.810 --> 08:02.180
When I came upon her
and the soldier from Nimbo,

08:02.220 --> 08:05.660
they seemed very close.

08:05.690 --> 08:09.090
- Lucas.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.820
Where is he?

08:10.860 --> 08:14.100
- Still think she poses
no threat?

08:14.130 --> 08:16.100
- Lucas is the one
who was hurt by your men

08:16.130 --> 08:17.870
and he lost his memory
because of it.

08:17.900 --> 08:19.070
So where is he?

08:19.100 --> 08:21.010
- She's wrong.

08:21.030 --> 08:23.070
Anna just confirmed it.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.970
His memory's intact.

08:25.010 --> 08:28.850
But it is protected by magic.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.980
- You want to earn my trust?

08:31.010 --> 08:34.039
You need to let me see him.

08:39.950 --> 08:40.980
- Dorothy.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.650
Dorothy.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.720
Are you okay?

08:51.000 --> 08:54.040
- I thought I'd never
see you again.

08:55.170 --> 08:57.740
Listen to me.

08:57.770 --> 09:00.100
I need you to lie
to The Wizard.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.740
I need you to tell him you
remember something... anything.

09:02.780 --> 09:03.950
If not, they're
going to kill you.

09:03.980 --> 09:05.780
- No, Dorothy...

09:05.810 --> 09:07.880
I need to know the truth.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.960
And they have
a way of getting it.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.880
- So this is what you want?

09:11.920 --> 09:15.990
- They can break the magic that
keeps me from knowing myself.

09:16.020 --> 09:18.250
- Who can?

09:35.940 --> 09:36.500
- The girl you call Dorothy,

09:38.050 --> 09:40.150
the girl we've been
searching for,

09:40.180 --> 09:42.240
the first true sign
of The Beast Forever,

09:42.280 --> 09:45.150
is in your custody
and you won't let us read her?

09:45.190 --> 09:47.060
- No woman in the High Council
is to touch her.

09:47.090 --> 09:48.990
- But we're
running out of time.

09:49.020 --> 09:52.960
The two moons grow closer and...
- Dorothy is not the problem.

09:52.990 --> 09:56.490
The soldier with the magic
upon his head is a problem.

09:56.530 --> 10:01.110
Ev not building our weapons
is a problem.

10:01.130 --> 10:03.470
You want to be
of service to me,

10:03.500 --> 10:06.740
then you'll solve one of
my real problems.

10:19.350 --> 10:22.320
I was hoping that
we'd have a moment alone.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.360
I want you to take over
for Elizabeth

10:24.390 --> 10:27.320
as head of the High Council.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.130
- If that's your wish.
- Sir?

10:34.330 --> 10:36.530
- Dorothy's reunion
with the soldier.

10:36.570 --> 10:38.340
Did it reveal anything new?

10:38.370 --> 10:40.000
- You knew it wouldn't.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.370
Yet you let her see him anyway.

10:42.410 --> 10:45.980
What sway does
she have over you?

10:50.180 --> 10:51.310
- You left...

10:51.350 --> 10:53.450
before I finished with you.

10:53.490 --> 10:56.190
I had such
grand plans for us.

10:59.290 --> 11:01.260
Go make me some tea.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.240
I'm about to exhaust myself.

11:04.260 --> 11:06.530
You can't hurt me.

11:06.570 --> 11:08.810
I'm protected by the Wizard.

11:14.140 --> 11:17.310
- But he's not.

11:17.340 --> 11:20.510
He's protected by magic.

11:20.550 --> 11:23.360
And the Wizard hates magic.

11:23.380 --> 11:25.050
- Can you break it?

11:25.090 --> 11:27.030
- I'll obliterate it.

11:27.050 --> 11:30.320
But it won't be pleasant.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.030
- Hey, hold on.

11:32.060 --> 11:33.830
I can talk to the Wizard.
I can stop this.

11:33.860 --> 11:37.290
- No, I don't want you to.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.360
- You don't have to do this.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.140
- In the past, you risked your
life to get answers.

11:42.170 --> 11:44.410
So let me do the same, please.

11:47.610 --> 11:50.150
- But I am not gonna stand by
and watch you suffer.

11:52.250 --> 11:56.050
- Then go.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.580
- I think she likes to watch.

12:02.590 --> 12:05.400
Shall we let her?

12:05.430 --> 12:09.300
- If this is what you want.

12:09.330 --> 12:12.600
- Let's see what lowly witch
has cast a spell on you.

12:41.230 --> 12:44.070
That's Glinda's magic!

12:44.100 --> 12:46.200
What secrets is she hiding
behind those

12:46.230 --> 12:48.160
pretty eyes of yours?

13:08.390 --> 13:10.660
- Come along now. Hurry up.

13:17.700 --> 13:20.940
- Jack?

13:21.700 --> 13:23.100
Jack, it's me.

13:23.140 --> 13:24.680
It's Tip.

13:24.700 --> 13:28.640
You're alive.
- No, don't touch me.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.420
- I can't believe
it's really you.

13:30.440 --> 13:33.240
- Why didn't you help me?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.710
- I thought I'd killed you.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.460
- So you just got on with it
and left me to die?

13:37.480 --> 13:38.650
- But you didn't.

13:38.690 --> 13:41.130
I can fix everything now.
Please let me...

13:41.150 --> 13:43.120
- No, we can't be fixed.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.400
I can't be fixed.

13:47.430 --> 13:48.500
- Jack, don't go.

13:48.530 --> 13:50.570
I love you!

13:50.600 --> 13:52.240
- What does that mean?

13:52.270 --> 13:53.540
- I don't know.

13:53.570 --> 13:57.240
I don't know what to say
or how to say it right.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.400
All I know is,
is you're my best friend.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.410
- I was your only friend!

14:01.440 --> 14:03.940
- Who's this, Jack?

14:04.740 --> 14:07.640
- It's no one.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.710
- Are you a no one, girl?

14:12.290 --> 14:15.430
You don't look like a no one.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.500
What is your name...

14:17.520 --> 14:19.290
little someone?

14:19.330 --> 14:21.430
- Tip.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.760
- And how do you know
my Jack?

14:24.800 --> 14:28.210
- We grew up together.

14:29.340 --> 14:31.440
We were best friends.

14:31.470 --> 14:35.000
- Is this the one
who killed you?

14:36.240 --> 14:39.610
Did you tell her
what you are now?

14:39.650 --> 14:40.720
Why?

14:40.750 --> 14:42.790
- I don't want to.

14:42.820 --> 14:45.760
- You have to.

14:45.790 --> 14:47.730
Children can't be corrected
if they don't know

14:47.750 --> 14:50.350
what they've done wrong.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.390
Show her.

14:53.430 --> 14:55.730
Show her what
she did to you.

15:19.790 --> 15:23.630
- The old Jack may have
been your friend...

15:23.660 --> 15:27.600
but the new Jack is mine.

15:27.630 --> 15:29.230
Come on, Jack.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.530
- Please.

15:44.740 --> 15:48.410
- Glinda's spell
is Cardinal Magic.

15:49.850 --> 15:53.430
Magic that can't be broken.

15:53.450 --> 15:54.650
- Well, then let him go.

15:54.690 --> 15:57.260
- I can't break it.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.650
But I can work around it.

15:58.690 --> 16:00.290
- How?

16:00.330 --> 16:03.270
- If I had a conduit.

16:03.300 --> 16:06.400
Someone close to you,
someone special...

16:06.430 --> 16:09.530
to slip past your defenses.

16:09.570 --> 16:10.810
- No.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.810
- Will this protect him?

16:12.840 --> 16:15.110
- Think of it as a back door

16:15.140 --> 16:17.870
into the mind
through the heart.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.370
If you're feeling sappy...

16:19.410 --> 16:20.810
- Dorothy,
don't listen to her.

16:20.850 --> 16:23.120
She's only trying to hurt you.
- Oh, absolutely.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.350
If your attachment
isn't strong enough,

16:25.390 --> 16:26.620
you'll both lose your minds.

16:26.650 --> 16:28.550
Either way works for me.

16:28.590 --> 16:30.460
- Look at me.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.690
Don't put yourself at risk.

16:44.670 --> 16:45.430
- Charcoal, saltpeter,
and brimstone.

16:49.210 --> 16:51.320
It can pierce
hardened steel.

16:51.340 --> 16:54.240
It's called a bullet.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.880
With your infrastructure,

16:55.920 --> 16:58.360
you can produce
thousands of these

16:58.390 --> 17:00.690
and the guns that fire them.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.420
You take half to
fortify your defenses,

17:03.460 --> 17:06.660
and I take half to defeat
The Beast Forever.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.430
- Where were these
20 years ago

17:11.460 --> 17:13.930
when the Beast rained down
on my kingdom?

17:13.970 --> 17:15.670
When they could have
saved my mother

17:15.700 --> 17:18.630
from being swallowed alive?

17:18.670 --> 17:22.869
- Bullets and guns are no match
for a beast made of water.

17:22.910 --> 17:26.380
The beast that's upon us now
is made of flesh and blood.

17:26.410 --> 17:30.880
A bullet is the fastest way
to stop a beating heart.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.720
- Where's Randall?

17:32.750 --> 17:34.920
Have you seen him?

17:34.950 --> 17:36.450
- Father.

17:36.490 --> 17:39.800
- I-I heard him barking
in my dreams,

17:39.830 --> 17:40.900
but when I woke, he...

17:40.930 --> 17:42.270
- The dog is dead.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.770
Father, he died when
I was a child.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.900
- No, no, I heard him!

17:46.930 --> 17:47.900
He's here.

17:47.930 --> 17:49.260
I heard him.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.970
- Yes.
Yes, of course you did.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.240
I'm sorry, Father, I'll... I'll
come and help you find him.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.850
You know I'm always
here for you.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.920
- Lady Ev, can you
commit to my cause?

18:03.280 --> 18:05.380
- With this?

18:05.420 --> 18:08.730
Bring me the gun and we'll talk.

18:52.030 --> 18:54.900
- Come on, Lucas,
let me in.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.270
Let me in.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.580
- What's in the wagon?

19:13.620 --> 19:14.850
What's in the wagon?

19:21.090 --> 19:24.990
- I suggest you let me pass.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.360
- Show me now.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.860
Or I'll cut you down,
I swear.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.810
- Ah!
- What is it?

19:40.080 --> 19:42.620
Ah! My eye!

19:49.420 --> 19:51.020
- Ah! Ah!

19:51.060 --> 19:53.430
Ah!

20:00.100 --> 20:01.640
- Don't kill him!

20:01.670 --> 20:05.110
Let's string him up.
- Girls! Run!

20:13.880 --> 20:15.110
- What's he got?

20:15.150 --> 20:17.420
- Don't let him swallow it!

20:25.960 --> 20:30.000
It can't be.

20:49.550 --> 20:52.590
I need that gun.

20:56.520 --> 21:00.120
- You could just take
the weapon from the girl.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.700
- I could've killed you,
Eamonn...

21:02.730 --> 21:05.470
when I took this city
from your king.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.610
But I spared your life.

21:07.630 --> 21:10.160
And gave it a new purpose.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.900
Because you are more valuable

21:11.940 --> 21:15.150
as my ally.

21:15.170 --> 21:18.640
Perhaps the same
is true for Dorothy.

21:23.020 --> 21:26.690
- The Mother Witch lives!

21:26.720 --> 21:29.930
And is breeding witches.

21:31.020 --> 21:33.520
For Glinda!

21:33.560 --> 21:37.020
She hid my own mother from me.

21:37.060 --> 21:39.460
- Mother South is dead.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.710
- No.

21:40.730 --> 21:43.160
She is alive.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.430
I saw young witches.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.200
Only she can make them.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.580
And the spell that held
the secret was Glinda's.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.040
- But Glinda, she watched the
last of the witches

21:53.080 --> 21:56.950
get slaughtered by The Beast.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.510
What good would new ones be?

21:58.550 --> 22:01.480
- Sober up, you fool!

22:01.520 --> 22:03.990
She's not going to use them
against the beast.

22:12.230 --> 22:12.960
- What did you think
Glinda would do?

22:15.200 --> 22:17.930
You imprisoned every witch
who practiced magic

22:17.970 --> 22:19.600
and repressed
the ones who didn't.

22:19.640 --> 22:22.480
And now they're going to
take Emerald City from you!

22:22.510 --> 22:24.650
They are going to take
Oz from you

22:24.680 --> 22:27.750
with the very elements
you outlawed!

22:27.780 --> 22:29.040
- And whose side
will you be on?

22:29.080 --> 22:30.680
- Oh, you'll be
the first to know.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.660
- Enough!

22:32.690 --> 22:36.190
I let her in.

22:36.220 --> 22:39.150
You put spies under my roof.

22:39.190 --> 22:41.920
Why?

22:41.960 --> 22:44.990
The High Council.

22:46.770 --> 22:48.610
Anna.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.010
They've all betrayed me.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.080
- I should return the
High Council in pieces,

22:52.100 --> 22:54.140
her little errand boy, too.

22:54.170 --> 22:57.200
- The soldier.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.940
When he surrendered,

23:00.980 --> 23:03.080
there was a child with him,
a young girl.

23:03.120 --> 23:06.160
- A witch.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.730
- Find her.

23:08.760 --> 23:12.260
All my soldiers on the hunt.

23:13.730 --> 23:15.630
- I killed men.

23:15.660 --> 23:19.030
Taking their skulls to Nimbo.

23:19.070 --> 23:21.040
You don't think me a monster?

23:21.070 --> 23:24.110
After what you saw?

23:24.140 --> 23:27.040
- No.

23:28.070 --> 23:30.710
You were protecting
those girls.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.240
And you risked your life
for them.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.990
- Why?

23:34.010 --> 23:38.650
- The tunnel in Nimbo would have
brought them to Glinda.

23:38.690 --> 23:41.090
You are sworn to her,
as am I.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.780
- He works for Glinda?

23:42.820 --> 23:44.050
- You know me?

23:44.090 --> 23:45.620
- There is a wagon
in the load-out

23:45.660 --> 23:47.200
that'll take you north
to Calcedon,

23:47.230 --> 23:50.100
Glinda's castle... she's ordered
me to free you.

23:50.130 --> 23:52.840
- There's, um... there's one of
the witch girls in the city.

23:52.870 --> 23:54.610
I have to find her.
- There is no time.

23:54.630 --> 23:56.660
You must leave before
The Wizard locks the gates.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.100
- I'll go find her.

23:58.140 --> 23:59.840
- You're on The Wizard's
side of this.

23:59.870 --> 24:03.040
- I'm not on anyone's side.

24:03.080 --> 24:05.280
- Well, then you better choose.

24:05.310 --> 24:07.240
War is coming to Oz.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.630
- It's late
to be wandering.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.020
- The Wizard told you
I'm his guest.

24:23.060 --> 24:24.790
I can leave when I want.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.830
- Or you could follow me.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.340
I'll take you to the girl.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.080
- I just... I don't get it.
What happened?

25:05.100 --> 25:08.140
- Just keep moving, or we'll
freeze to death.

25:09.440 --> 25:12.670
- I keep thinking
about Roberto.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.210
- Oh.

25:31.430 --> 25:34.660
- Frank, stop! Stop!

25:34.700 --> 25:37.900
We mean no harm or disrespect.

25:37.940 --> 25:39.380
We are lost.

25:39.410 --> 25:41.680
We need your help.

25:41.710 --> 25:45.280
My name is
Dr. Jane Andrews.

25:46.810 --> 25:49.180
I'm the leader
of this group.

26:19.380 --> 26:20.720
- Wait here.

26:30.390 --> 26:32.230
- Toto!

26:32.260 --> 26:33.800
Hey, boy.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.390
Is she...

26:39.430 --> 26:40.830
- Asleep.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.220
- Why are you helping me?

26:51.240 --> 26:53.010
- Not you.

26:57.850 --> 27:00.510
- I'll bring her safely
to Glinda's.

27:00.550 --> 27:03.480
- If you can get past my guards.

27:13.170 --> 27:16.210
- There's your wagon, Sylvie,

27:16.240 --> 27:18.210
but there's too many guards.

27:20.970 --> 27:23.040
You have to stay here.

27:23.080 --> 27:24.950
I'm gonna go get help.

27:24.980 --> 27:27.450
Stay here.

27:28.850 --> 27:31.990
Keep her safe, Toto.
Trust you. Good boy.

27:32.020 --> 27:33.390
I'll be right back.

27:38.260 --> 27:40.800
- When you come back home,

27:40.830 --> 27:42.100
I'll make you a big fire.

27:43.430 --> 27:45.200
You can lie in front of that,

27:45.230 --> 27:48.200
and then we go hunting
like we did in the old days.

27:48.230 --> 27:50.000
Just you and me.

27:54.140 --> 27:57.100
- Jack.

27:57.140 --> 27:59.140
I asked you
to find my father,

27:59.180 --> 28:01.190
yet I don't see my father.

28:01.210 --> 28:03.980
Were my instructions not clear?

28:04.020 --> 28:06.220
- He's gone.
He must've wandered.

28:06.250 --> 28:08.180
I can't find him anywhere.

28:14.130 --> 28:16.970
- Frank?

28:17.000 --> 28:19.900
Frank.

28:23.300 --> 28:27.030
Almost didn't recognize
my own name.

28:27.070 --> 28:29.170
- I need your help.

28:29.210 --> 28:31.580
- And I need yours.

28:31.610 --> 28:35.880
There's still a lot that
you don't know about me.

28:35.920 --> 28:39.820
- Are you my father?

28:42.090 --> 28:43.930
- Let's try this.

28:43.960 --> 28:47.100
Hey.
Come here.

28:49.060 --> 28:52.530
Oh.

28:53.970 --> 28:55.210
- Little Dorothy.

29:02.110 --> 29:06.950
- Oh. Baby okay?
- Yes, she's fine.

29:06.980 --> 29:10.050
- So was she really a witch?

29:10.080 --> 29:12.880
- Most Merciful and Stern
of the Eastern Wood?

29:12.920 --> 29:14.660
Yes.

29:14.690 --> 29:16.290
Real witch.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.050
- Can she help us?

29:18.090 --> 29:22.020
- She prefers to kill us.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.060
When we tore into this world,

29:24.100 --> 29:26.000
we caused a ripple effect.

29:26.030 --> 29:27.930
Something bad has come
to these people

29:27.970 --> 29:29.970
because of us,
and the only way to stop it

29:30.000 --> 29:33.330
is for us to leave.

29:36.310 --> 29:39.550
She's gonna send us home.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.140
- How?

29:42.180 --> 29:43.540
- She controls the weather.

29:43.580 --> 29:45.010
She can summon her own tornado.

29:45.050 --> 29:46.510
- But we're going home?

29:46.550 --> 29:47.580
- Yeah.

29:47.620 --> 29:48.690
- We're going home!

29:48.720 --> 29:51.990
- I'm not leaving.

29:52.020 --> 29:53.590
- We all are.

29:53.630 --> 29:55.700
- No, you can't decide things
here, not for me.

29:55.730 --> 29:57.200
I decide.

29:57.230 --> 30:00.370
- We all have to leave,
that's the deal.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.570
- Well, I'm not leaving.

30:01.600 --> 30:05.230
I brought us here.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.940
- It was...

30:07.970 --> 30:12.010
it was a mistake.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.210
My computer malfunctioned.

30:14.250 --> 30:15.550
- No.

30:15.580 --> 30:19.050
I locked you out
to destroy your machine.

30:20.650 --> 30:22.120
- Frank...

30:22.150 --> 30:23.650
- What? She treats me
like I was nothing.

30:23.690 --> 30:25.160
Like... you treat me
like I'm stupid.

30:25.190 --> 30:26.690
I'm not stupid.

30:26.730 --> 30:30.030
I can do things.
I'm smart, yeah?

30:30.060 --> 30:32.690
I found this new world here.

30:32.730 --> 30:35.300
Didn't I?
Me.

30:35.330 --> 30:38.300
I'm not leaving it.

30:38.340 --> 30:39.580
What?
I did!

30:39.610 --> 30:42.050
I did this.

30:42.070 --> 30:45.310
- Roberto, what about him?

30:45.340 --> 30:47.710
You killed him, Frank!

30:57.120 --> 31:00.720
- His name was Roberto.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.100
Your father.

31:02.130 --> 31:06.740
He was a smart man,
a kind man.

31:06.770 --> 31:11.310
He died in the accident
that brought us here.

31:14.270 --> 31:16.770
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

31:16.810 --> 31:20.980
I tried to save him.

31:21.780 --> 31:24.980
- I don't trust you.

31:27.120 --> 31:30.060
Look at you.

31:30.090 --> 31:33.030
The way you dress,
the way you act.

31:33.060 --> 31:34.430
That wig.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.620
You're just lying
to everyone.

31:39.800 --> 31:43.240
I could say
the same about you.

31:45.100 --> 31:49.340
We do what we need
to survive.

31:49.380 --> 31:52.420
Which is why I need to ask you,
where's the little witch?

31:54.510 --> 31:57.280
- I can't tell you that.

32:00.390 --> 32:03.160
But if you let her
go back to the north,

32:03.190 --> 32:05.200
she'll be safe,
and so will you.

32:16.500 --> 32:17.800
- Come!

32:17.840 --> 32:20.040
I have a proposition for you.

32:22.410 --> 32:24.750
- Where are you?

32:24.780 --> 32:27.520
You're here somewhere,
I know you are.

32:27.550 --> 32:28.790
I...

32:28.810 --> 32:30.380
I'm going to find you.

32:30.420 --> 32:32.190
Did you go running away again?

32:32.220 --> 32:35.130
Hmm?

32:36.860 --> 32:39.800
I know you're here...
Where are you, boy?

32:39.830 --> 32:40.860
Where are you?

32:40.890 --> 32:42.490
Randall?

32:48.470 --> 32:51.340
Here, boy. Randall.
No barking.

32:55.370 --> 32:56.340
Randall?

33:00.350 --> 33:03.120
Randall?

33:07.850 --> 33:10.250
- What is this?

33:10.290 --> 33:12.460
- All the power in
Emerald City

33:12.490 --> 33:15.490
is generated from
underneath us.

33:17.230 --> 33:19.840
I was brought to Oz

33:19.870 --> 33:22.270
in a vortex chamber.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.200
This one here...

33:24.240 --> 33:26.510
can send you home.

33:26.540 --> 33:28.910
- Now?

33:28.940 --> 33:32.170
- I just have one thing
to ask of you first.

33:33.380 --> 33:36.450
- I'll do anything.

33:36.480 --> 33:39.880
- You were born in Oz...

33:39.920 --> 33:42.790
Oz brought you back.

33:42.820 --> 33:47.190
Have you even
asked yourself why?

33:47.960 --> 33:50.500
Destiny.

33:50.530 --> 33:52.240
Your destiny.

33:52.260 --> 33:55.360
Just like mine
a long time ago.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.370
You were brought back to Oz

33:58.400 --> 34:02.170
to save us all.

34:02.210 --> 34:04.280
- I'm no savior.

34:04.310 --> 34:06.310
- Then what are you?

34:06.350 --> 34:09.350
Are you just a girl from Kansas?

34:09.380 --> 34:12.380
Just a girl who
misses her mother?

34:12.420 --> 34:15.429
Or are you more?

34:16.960 --> 34:20.429
More than just the things
that you've lost.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.469
- What do you want me to do?

34:25.500 --> 34:28.840
- Stop Glinda.

34:28.870 --> 34:32.440
Stop this war from killing
thousands of people

34:32.469 --> 34:34.800
and tearing this world apart.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.440
- But you have your giants.
So use them.

34:37.480 --> 34:41.920
- No, their power's locked
in the Prison of Abject.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.820
- How can I kill a witch?

34:43.850 --> 34:46.290
- With a gun.
You've already proven that.

34:46.320 --> 34:49.429
- I'm not gonna kill someone
just so that I can go home.

34:49.460 --> 34:52.000
- Are you sure?

35:15.380 --> 35:17.310
Magic.

35:42.970 --> 35:43.940
- Dorothy.

35:43.980 --> 35:45.620
Dorothy!

35:49.580 --> 35:50.580
- We need to find Sylvie.

35:50.620 --> 35:53.520
- I already have.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.390
- Dorothy!

35:58.420 --> 36:00.890
- Sylvie.

36:00.930 --> 36:02.870
I should have never
left you alone.

36:02.890 --> 36:06.660
I'm so sorry.

36:08.770 --> 36:10.510
- You're not
going with them.

36:10.540 --> 36:12.710
- I'm on your side.
- I have my orders.

36:12.740 --> 36:14.710
- I'm not leaving without her.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.640
- Glinda won't be pleased.

36:16.680 --> 36:18.780
- I don't care
what Glinda thinks.

36:23.010 --> 36:25.610
- Calcedon lies beyond
Gilliken Country.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.380
There's an abandoned
farmhouse half a day

36:27.420 --> 36:28.930
past the old mining road.

36:28.950 --> 36:31.920
Stay the night there
and continue north.

36:35.030 --> 36:36.400
- Thank you.

36:55.980 --> 36:58.980
- Was that her?

36:59.020 --> 37:01.530
The witch?

37:01.550 --> 37:03.650
- The less you know,
the better.

37:03.690 --> 37:04.960
- What did Glinda do?

37:04.990 --> 37:07.990
- She chose to fight back.

37:10.660 --> 37:12.690
- Was I never meant
to help The Wizard?

37:12.730 --> 37:14.730
- You were here
to learn his secrets.

37:14.770 --> 37:16.670
- And once they were known?

37:16.700 --> 37:18.060
- Then we wouldn't need
a Wizard anymore.

37:21.910 --> 37:25.820
Anna. Anna.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.880
- You see? They're all
working against me.

37:28.910 --> 37:30.810
- I cleared the guards.

37:30.850 --> 37:33.620
The wagon will pass without
being stopped.

37:33.650 --> 37:35.950
And no one will follow them.

37:35.990 --> 37:37.530
Clever plan.

37:37.560 --> 37:39.500
- It was Dorothy's.

37:39.530 --> 37:41.600
When she gets to Glinda's,
she'll stop this war

37:41.630 --> 37:43.530
before it even starts.

37:43.560 --> 37:47.060
- You place too much
trust in her.

37:47.100 --> 37:50.770
- Yet she trusts me even more.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.000
- But she gave you
the only weapon

37:52.040 --> 37:53.540
that could've
killed the witch.

37:53.570 --> 37:55.970
- Not the only one.

37:56.010 --> 37:58.620
Glinda's always been
cold as stone.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.710
Now she'll be dead like one.

38:41.020 --> 38:43.830
Can you put this
in some water?

38:51.100 --> 38:52.070
Yes.

39:00.710 --> 39:02.950
Yes.

39:08.610 --> 39:11.650
This is lead.

39:12.680 --> 39:13.980
Lead.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.660
Okay.

39:41.950 --> 39:44.120
This is a battery.

39:44.150 --> 39:45.790
Electricity.

39:45.820 --> 39:47.990
It's gonna change your lives.

39:49.760 --> 39:51.030
- No.
It's not magic.

39:51.060 --> 39:53.000
It's science.

39:53.020 --> 39:54.090
No magic.

39:54.130 --> 39:55.930
Science.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.730
Science... I'm a scientist.

40:02.030 --> 40:03.160
Hello.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.730
What's your name?

40:04.770 --> 40:07.130
- Nahara.

40:07.170 --> 40:10.800
- You want to see
my experiment, here?

40:50.920 --> 40:53.790
- Magic.

40:53.820 --> 40:54.930
- Yes.

41:23.980 --> 41:26.210
- No. Wait.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.150
- Lady Ev.
Whatever you wish...

41:28.190 --> 41:31.800
- I wished to leave
this place forever!

41:31.820 --> 41:33.790
Now I will return...

41:33.830 --> 41:36.770
with all the soldiers of Ev.

41:36.800 --> 41:39.840
And we will turn your
Emerald City red with blood.

41:39.870 --> 41:43.210
- Your call for vengeance
is just.

41:43.230 --> 41:45.970
But we are not your enemy.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
For it is Glinda
who claimed your father.

41:49.040 --> 41:53.070
And it is Glinda who should
feel your wrath...

41:53.110 --> 41:55.180
with this.

41:55.210 --> 41:59.780
Strong enough to kill a witch.

41:59.820 --> 42:01.830
Strong enough to kill
The Beast Forever.

42:03.790 --> 42:05.760
A demonstration.

42:17.400 --> 42:20.030
- Make these guns!

42:21.040 --> 42:23.080
We take them to war.

42:25.110 --> 42:26.840
A war on magic!

42:26.880 --> 42:28.920
For the very soul of Oz!
