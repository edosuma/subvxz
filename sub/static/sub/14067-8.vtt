00:14.400 --> 00:15.500

00:15.500 --> 00:18.000
to be honest, i don't really give a crap
about interest rates.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.900
if he didn't get the loan,
he's going into bankruptcy anyway.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.000
the investor's got money.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.900
let him go cry on the shoulder
of his, uh, trophy wife.

oh, you apologize?

00:43.200 --> 00:44.900

that might help.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.800
how about you demonstrate
a modicum of courtesy?

00:47.800 --> 00:48.800
that'u a nice accent.

gerry ence dresses like this all the time,
and he wins almost all his cases.

02:42.800 --> 02:43.900
so do you.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.500
gerry spence is a country lawyer.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.800
he tries his cases in wyoming and...

02:48.500 --> 02:50.100

02:52.200 --> 02:56.700
denny, it's good to have a gerry spence,
but we certainly don't need two.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.700
plus, we need a denny crane.

02:58.700 --> 02:59.800
mr.shore?

03:01.700 --> 03:02.600
yes.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.300
my name is kim wang shu.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.500
i need a lawyer.

03:05.500 --> 03:06.300
let me guess.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.900
they want to take back your gold medal,
but you really are 16.

03:09.100 --> 03:12.900
i don't have a gold medal,
and i'm only 15.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.400
how can i help you, ms.shu?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.200
i'm pregnant.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.400
i can't have an abortion
without parental consent.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.700
my father's dead.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.100
my mother won't give it to me.

03:22.200 --> 03:26.400
i need something called a judicial bypass,
and for that, i need a lawyer.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.400
well-- uh, hold on.

03:29.300 --> 03:33.800
alan, i don't talk about this much,
but i'm an icon.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.000
yes, you and gerry spence both.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.300
and icons, well...

03:39.900 --> 03:44.500
i like to pretend that everything i say and do
is on televisi for the whole world to see.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.400
it's just a little game
i play with myself.

03:47.300 --> 03:47.800
and?

03:47.800 --> 03:50.600
and who's gonna watch a show
about abortion?

03:51.400 --> 03:52.300
it's not fun.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.600
well, denny, you and i
could make it fun.

03:54.600 --> 03:55.600
i don't think so.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.400
try to look at it as a challenge.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.100
consider it your emmy episode.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.000
well, yeah, but then
there's the other thing.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.400
which is?

04:02.600 --> 04:05.500
well, look at her, alan--
a sweet, cute little kid.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.100
if we help her get an abortion,
she's gonna burn in hell forever and ever.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.800
we'll represent you.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.200
i can hear them changing the channel.

04:33.800 --> 04:34.900
what are you looking at?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.500
hey, don't start with me, mack.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.800
i just got finished cappin' one guy,
and there's two things you should know-- 

04:39.800 --> 04:42.600
it was fun, and the day's
just gettin' started.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.000
i've posted bond.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.100
arraignment's in half an hour.

04:49.100 --> 04:49.900
let's go.

05:00.700 --> 05:04.600
is there a particular reason
your mother opposes the abortion?

05:04.600 --> 05:05.800
oh, please.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.300
besides it not being fun.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.100
she just doesn't believe in abortion.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.000
she's very pro-life.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.200
when ias a kid, we'd just
go down to mexico.

05:14.300 --> 05:18.700
god doesn't care what happens in mexico
since it's already a kind of pre-hell, 

05:18.700 --> 05:21.600
which is why they wanna
come up here illegally.

05:23.200 --> 05:23.900
what?

05:25.800 --> 05:26.500
okay.

05:26.500 --> 05:30.000
obviously, it's in our best interest
to get just the right judge.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.600
what about the baby's best interest?

05:31.600 --> 05:32.500
does that matter?

05:34.100 --> 05:35.600
don't shove me!

05:35.600 --> 05:37.000
you listen to me right now.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.500
if you're gonna spew your politics
all over this, i-- 

05:38.500 --> 05:40.400
politics?
a baby's politics?

05:40.500 --> 05:43.000
denny, i respect your potion
on the issue.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.800
- you need to respect the clie's.
- no, i don't. she's a kid.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.700
- nevertheless, she has the right to choose--
- the right?

05:47.700 --> 05:49.500
the--what about her responsibility?

05:49.500 --> 05:50.700
- look--
- what about the baby's right?

05:50.700 --> 05:53.400
- the fetus doesn't have a legal--
- "fetus." 

05:53.600 --> 05:54.600
does that make it sound less human?

05:54.600 --> 05:55.500
does that make it easier, 

05:55.500 --> 05:59.000
like calling it a procedure instead
of an abortion, or what it really is-- 

05:59.000 --> 05:59.800
mr.crane.

06:01.100 --> 06:02.500
no disrespect.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.200
but you're fired.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.500
i told you it wouldn't be fun.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.400
he beat a man up?

06:15.000 --> 06:15.800
him?

06:15.800 --> 06:17.100
what's so surprising about that?

06:17.100 --> 06:18.000
i beat people up.

06:18.000 --> 06:18.800
jerry.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.300
your honor, it was an altercation.

06:20.300 --> 06:21.300
two people were fighting.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.200
after he committed the initiating assault.

06:23.200 --> 06:23.900
he threw a muffin.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.800
he provoked the fight
and broke a man's nose.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.500
many witnesses saw it unfold.

06:28.100 --> 06:28.900
him?

06:29.400 --> 06:29.900
jerry.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.000
it's an aggravated assault, judge.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.800
- with baked goods?
- with a fist.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.200
it's a he said/he said, judge.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.000
a 1-day case.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
let's just get it over with.

06:36.000 --> 06:36.800
we can't be serious.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.100
it s simply a dispute which escal-- 

06:38.100 --> 06:39.500
the defense stands ready for trial.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.100
jerry.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.300
- make my day.
- jerry.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.500
i want my day in court.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.400
fine.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.600
10:00 tomorrow.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.300
adjourned.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.300
what areou doing?

06:47.300 --> 06:48.600
and i'm representing myself.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.100
- don't be ridiculous.
- i am.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.500
you can second chair if you want,
but i'm defending myself.

06:52.500 --> 06:55.500
it's what i did in that coffee shop,
and it's what i'll do here.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.400
for you.

06:57.700 --> 06:58.400
what's this?

06:58.400 --> 06:59.200
subpoena.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.800
you're a witness for the prosecion.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.600
judge peyton?

07:09.600 --> 07:11.400
do y know where she stands on abortion?

07:12.600 --> 07:13.400
she's a woman.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.700
alan, manz women are pro-life.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.600
this doesn't split along gender lines.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.500
she should be a good judge for this.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.100
why do you need me?
it seems-- 

07:21.100 --> 07:23.000
because i want a woman
at the table

07:26.000 --> 07:27.800
i don't know if i'm your woman.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.700
mr.shore?

07:31.800 --> 07:32.700
yes.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.300
my name is ming wang shu.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.200
i believe you're representi my daughter.

07:36.200 --> 07:36.900
i am.

07:36.900 --> 07:37.500
please.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.700
and this is shirley schmidt.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.900
- hello.
- hello.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.100
if i may...

07:47.500 --> 07:51.400
i would ask you to respect that
this is a family matter.

07:52.700 --> 07:54.600
i do respect that, mrs.shu.

07:54.600 --> 08:00.300
but liket or not, at your daughter's instigation,
this has now become a legal matter as well.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.600
she's a child.

08:02.600 --> 08:03.700
legally...

08:03.800 --> 08:06.800
your daughter has a right
to ternate this pregnancy.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.500
with parental consent,
which i am withholding.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.900
or she can obtain a judicial bypass.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.600
they are almost always granted.

08:19.900 --> 08:24.400
have you ever had a child
of yours terminated, mr.shore?

08:25.800 --> 08:29.000
i suspect if you have, it haus you, 

08:30.100 --> 08:33.100
particularly if you participated
in that decision.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.600
mrs.shu, this is not...

08:38.000 --> 08:39.100
about me.

08:39.799 --> 08:43.400
and i must respectfully say,
it's not about you.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.900
she's my daughter.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.200
i know her.
you do not.

08:47.800 --> 08:51.400
and i know that if
she makes this decision...

08:52.700 --> 08:54.300
she'll never get over it.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.800
you need to defer to her mother on this.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.100
jerry.

09:24.000 --> 09:24.800
carl.

09:25.300 --> 09:26.400
you mind getting down?

09:26.800 --> 09:27.700
certainly.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.700
katie brought me up to speed.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.600
sounds like you got a little emotional.

09:36.600 --> 09:40.900
you know, conviction for aggravated assault
is more than just an inconvenience, jerry.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.800
it could affect your bar status.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.900
you also run the risk of serving time.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.400
jerry, look at me.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.600
let me defend you.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.300
no.

10:03.500 --> 10:06.300
first, he collides with me in line.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.000
i'm not sure it wasn't intentional.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.600
then he throws out some
hollow apology,you know, like..."sorry." 

10:11.600 --> 10:17.600
then while i'm ordering my coffee,
i get hit with a mfin right in my face.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.100
i approach him to say,
"what's up with that?" 

10:20.400 --> 10:24.200
and he hauls off and slugs me,
knocks me out.

10:25.100 --> 10:29.100
do you really believe
i collided with you on purse, sir?

10:29.100 --> 10:30.400
hey, i wouldn't know.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.100
you're clearly a vicious person.

10:32.100 --> 10:32.800
move to strike.

10:32.800 --> 10:33.500
oh, sorry.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.800
you stepped into that.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.700
did you not refer to me
as a demento?

10:39.700 --> 10:41.100
no, i did not.

10:41.100 --> 10:41.900
liar.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.600
see? he was making funny sounds
at me like that.

10:44.600 --> 10:49.300
you didn't say to the person you were speaking to
on the phone that i was a demento out with my nurse?

10:49.300 --> 10:50.900
- no, i did not.
- liar!

10:50.900 --> 10:52.100
mr.espenson!

10:52.100 --> 10:55.200
did you not come to attack me
after i threw the muffin?

10:55.500 --> 10:58.900
i was angry, but i wasn't
going to attack you.

10:58.900 --> 10:59.800
liar, liar.

11:00.700 --> 11:03.400
hey, you can try and make me out
to be the bad guy, 

11:03.400 --> 11:07.100
but, uh, i am not violent, i've
never been arrested like you have.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.600
i am a law-abiding person who was
simply looki to buy a cup of coffee.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.200
and look at me now?

11:12.400 --> 11:13.900
my nose is broken.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.100
you all set?

11:28.900 --> 11:31.900
kim's by the elevator waiting.

11:33.700 --> 11:34.600
set.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.100
what's wrong?

11:40.500 --> 11:44.200
alan, this--this does feel
like a family matter.

11:45.100 --> 11:50.100
shirley, you realize massachusetts has one
of the more restrictive policies on abortion.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.400
in this state, girls need
attorneys more than-- 

11:52.400 --> 11:54.500
is everything a case with you?

11:54.900 --> 11:56.000
- well--
- is that how it works?

11:56.000 --> 12:00.100
as soon as a client walks in,
you start preparing your closing argument?

12:00.100 --> 12:00.900
that's not fair.

12:01.000 --> 12:01.700
fair?

12:04.500 --> 12:06.100
you've never been a parent.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.700
i am one.

12:08.700 --> 12:13.500
and an attorney running interference with
a parental-child relationship 

12:13.700 --> 12:15.500
hardly feels fair.

12:15.900 --> 12:18.200
if it were my daughter, and a lawyer...

12:20.500 --> 12:21.800
i'd want to throttle him.

12:22.900 --> 12:26.000
and i can also tell you
from personal experience, 

12:26.000 --> 12:28.900
anyone who has an abortion--
you never get over it.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.200
trust me.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.300
no matter how pro-choice...

12:38.200 --> 12:42.200
are you saying that undage girls should
be forced to carry a baby to term 

12:42.200 --> 12:45.000
if the parent so orders, mrs.schmidt?

12:47.500 --> 12:49.600
no, i'm not saying that.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.600
well, then perhaps all you
can really do here 

12:51.600 --> 12:55.400
is advise of my legal rights
and represent those rights in court.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.700
kim, whatevechoice you make here...

13:00.400 --> 13:02.400
will follow you the rest of your life.

13:04.900 --> 13:08.400
i came to this country three years ago
for two reons-- 

13:08.900 --> 13:14.200
be with my mother and to become a citizen
in a country that prioritizes individual freedoms.

13:15.300 --> 13:19.500
my understanding is that attorneys are
in the busines of safeguarding those frdoms.

13:26.700 --> 13:31.600
mr.hellman was carrying on a rather loud
and abrasive conversation on his cell phone.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.400
we turned to look at him while in line,

13:33.400 --> 13:35.800
and he then assaulted us verbally,

13:35.800 --> 13:39.900
referring to us as mr.and mrs.snoopy,
i believe.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.300
then what happened?

13:41.500 --> 13:46.100
then after jerry placed his order,he turned
and inadvertently collided with mr.hellman.

13:46.100 --> 13:51.000
and mr.hellman reacted
in a threatening and discourteous manner.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.000
then.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.500
jerr has some verbal ticks.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.400
mr.hellman proceeded
to ridicule him for that.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.300
and as we were heading off,
he did refer to jerry as a demento.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.400
you're a close friend of mr.espenson.

14:03.400 --> 14:04.100
i am.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.700
in fact, you're testifying today
only under subpoena.

14:06.900 --> 14:07.800
that's correct.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.200
but you appreciate your obligation
to tell the truth.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.400
i do.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.700
what happened next, ms.lloyd?

14:14.700 --> 14:17.200
well, we proceeded to go
and wait for jerry's order.

14:17.300 --> 14:22.300
he was becoming increasingly upset
over mr.hellman's discourteous remarks.

14:23.700 --> 14:27.800
and then he tossed
a blueberry muffin at him.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.500
tossed it or threw it?

14:31.800 --> 14:32.700
threw it.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
threw it quite hard.

14:35.800 --> 14:36.700
it was only a muffin.

14:36.700 --> 14:37.800
and then what happened?

14:38.400 --> 14:40.200
mr.hellman charged at jerry.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.600
both appeared
to throw punches simultaneously.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.200
jerry's fist arrived first.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.000
mr.hellman was rendered unconscious.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
and then what?

14:47.300 --> 14:48.900
- uh, that's pretty much it.
- really?

14:49.100 --> 14:52.100
what did mr.espenson do
after he knocked mr.heman out?

14:52.100 --> 14:53.300
did he go to his aid?

14:57.400 --> 14:58.200
no.

14:58.700 --> 14:59.800
what did he do?

15:02.400 --> 15:03.600
he danced.

15:03.700 --> 15:04.600
he danced?

15:04.600 --> 15:05.300
yes.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.600
what kind of dance?

15:08.300 --> 15:09.300
it was...

15:09.600 --> 15:10.700
celebratory.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.600
did he yell anything?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.900
he yelled, "yes.yes."

15:16.600 --> 15:17.800
anything else?

15:19.400 --> 15:21.600
he inquired as to whether
there were any other takers.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.600
meaning did anyone else
want to fight him?

15:26.100 --> 15:27.300
i suppose.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.600
anything else?

15:30.600 --> 15:31.700
he sang.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.300
he seemed to enjoy the whole thing?

15:35.900 --> 15:37.000
he did.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.200
i hardly think she was deliberately
trying get you convicted.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.500
yes, she was.
i heard it.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.300
jerry, you never should've represented yourself.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.200
i mean, you never should've thrown a muffin-- 

15:56.200 --> 15:57.500
fine.
take her side.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.300
- i'm not taking her side.i'm just saying--
- why am i not surprised?

15:59.300 --> 16:01.200
- yes, you are!
- stop yelling at me.

16:01.300 --> 16:02.000
hey!

16:08.600 --> 16:09.600
he's losing?

16:10.400 --> 16:11.500
seems so.

16:16.600 --> 16:20.100
alan, if you don't mind, i'm...

16:20.800 --> 16:22.900
going to withdraw from this case.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
i do mind.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.100
why?

16:26.500 --> 16:28.300
i'm not comfortable arguing...

16:29.800 --> 16:32.600
i--i'm going to just pass on this case.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.100
shirley, how do you think the judg will
interpret you pulling out all of a sudden?

16:37.100 --> 16:39.700
- we haven't even gone to court yet.
- i need a woman at the table.

16:39.700 --> 16:40.900
- get another one.
- i want you...

16:40.900 --> 16:42.100
- you don't have--
- your credibility-- 

16:42.100 --> 16:43.300
what's your problem, shirley?

16:43.300 --> 16:46.400
i told you my problem.
i'm not comfortable.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.500
are you comfortable with
the government legislating abortion?

16:48.500 --> 16:49.600
check that--outlawing it?

16:49.600 --> 16:50.500
because that's the next step.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.100
oh, please.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.700
the supreme court already has the votes.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.100
stevens is 88 years old.

16:54.100 --> 16:54.800
once he goes--

16:54.800 --> 16:57.500
- this is not about politics, alan.
- of course it is.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.700
when-- no, it is not.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.200
when did you have your last abortion?

17:02.400 --> 17:06.099
until you know everything that goes with it,
don't you dare lecture me or anybody else-- 

17:06.099 --> 17:07.400
i know what goes with it!

17:08.599 --> 17:10.400
obviously i haven't
experienced the physical part,

17:10.400 --> 17:12.599
but i know the overwhelming emotion
that goes with it.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.300
i know the sense of loss,
i know the doubt, the guilt.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.300
so please don't...

17:17.099 --> 17:18.599
shirley, did it
ever occur to you 

17:18.599 --> 17:21.900
that one of the reasons i wanted you
on this case is precisely bec-- 

17:35.200 --> 17:36.700
maybe we should both get out.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.200
no, we shouldn't.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.900
we're lawyers here first.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.200
a young girl has come to us for help 

17:45.200 --> 17:48.100
to fight for a legal right
that we both happen to believe in.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.500
shirley, we separate ourselves
from our emotions all the time.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.500
it's what we do.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.700
it's what we have to do here.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.200
what?

18:49.800 --> 18:51.000
how's the case going?

18:52.400 --> 18:54.800
surprising difficult,
you'll be happy to know.

18:57.300 --> 18:58.700
something's happening.

18:59.000 --> 18:59.900
what do you mean?

19:00.100 --> 19:02.000
i mean it's getting close, denny.

19:03.800 --> 19:08.700
i can just feel roe vs.wade being chipped away
at this parental consent law, 

19:08.700 --> 19:10.400
the judicial bypass hoops.

19:12.300 --> 19:14.500
the wall's coming down.
can feel it.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.500
uh, may i say something,
friend to friend?

19:20.800 --> 19:23.200
you pro-choice people...

19:24.400 --> 19:27.000
you need roe vs.wade.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.600
you're desperate for it, 

19:29.300 --> 19:32.000
not because you're sure of your opinion,
but because you're not.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.600
you need to cling to that ruling
as moral validation

19:35.600 --> 19:38.600
for a position you're not
entirely comfortable with...

19:39.300 --> 19:40.600
deep down.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.600
i don't know exactly what he plans to do,
but it's not going well at all.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.000
does he plan to testify?

20:23.200 --> 20:24.600
he has to, otherwise...

20:26.300 --> 20:27.500
throw me under the bus, why don't you?

20:27.500 --> 20:28.800
and then back up over me.

20:28.800 --> 20:29.600
i did not throw you under a bus.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.100
oh, you most certainly did.

20:31.800 --> 20:32.500
ow.hey!

20:32.500 --> 20:34.500
he asked me questions.
i was under oath.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.700
what am i supposed to do now?

20:35.700 --> 20:36.700
thanks a lot.

20:38.500 --> 20:39.500
howdy, partner.

20:39.700 --> 20:40.300
hey!

20:40.300 --> 20:41.400
what did i do?

20:41.900 --> 20:43.000
ow!

20:50.400 --> 20:52.100
how dare you attack me like that?

20:52.100 --> 20:53.000
how dare you?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.200
i thought we were friends.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.200
i should've committed perjury?

20:55.200 --> 20:56.500
you didn't have to relish it.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.400
- i did not relish it.
- yes, you did.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.100
there was judgment in itkatie.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.000
you have been throwing out
judgment from the start.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.500
instead of having my back or supporting-- 

21:03.500 --> 21:05.000
jerry, you went bonkers!

21:05.000 --> 21:07.700
you launched a muffin,
knocked a man unconscious,

21:07.700 --> 21:10.400
challenged the rest of the caf
to a fight and then did a dance.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.500
it was grotesque.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.300
if anything, i've underplayed my dismay.

21:13.300 --> 21:15.700
and by the way, what if
you hadn't landed the first blow?

21:15.700 --> 21:17.100
maybe joe-bob might have turned on me.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.400
you might've put me in danger.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.200
how about taking a little responsibility?

21:20.400 --> 21:21.300
how about an apology?

21:21.300 --> 21:21.900
poop-head!

21:21.900 --> 21:23.300
poop-head yourself!

21:23.800 --> 21:25.300
let me tell ya, hot cakes.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.500
if you can't stand the heat,
get-- 

21:26.500 --> 21:28.000
i can take the heat just fine.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.600
and do not ever call me hot cakes.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.600
here's my problem-- 

21:45.100 --> 21:50.600
on the one hand, you're telling me she just had
an impulsive lapser of judgment fo months ago, 

21:50.900 --> 21:53.800
and yet, you are maintaining that she has the maturity 

21:53.800 --> 21:59.000
to make one of the most important and far-reaching
decisions that any person could be called upon-- 

21:59.000 --> 22:01.300
judge, that's how it works with abortion.
let's not kid ourselves.

22:01.300 --> 22:05.000
and let's t pretend you know better than her mother
the impact this will have for the rest of her-- 

22:05.000 --> 22:09.900
i'm considering the impact of a teenager
having to raise a child-- 

22:09.900 --> 22:11.000
she doesn't have to raise it.

22:11.000 --> 22:11.800
there's adoption.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.300
the law gives her the right
to terminate this pregnancy.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.500
no, only with parental consent,
which she does not have.

22:16.500 --> 22:17.700
the bypass is therefore-- 

22:17.700 --> 22:18.500
come on.

22:18.500 --> 22:21.700
let's at least wait
till the supreme crt repudiates roe v.wade.

22:21.700 --> 22:22.800
why rob them of all their fun?

22:22.800 --> 22:23.500
mr.shore-- 

22:23.500 --> 22:26.700
your honor, this bypass requirement
is unreasonable, 

22:26.700 --> 22:31.000
perhaps even unconstitutional,
as is the requirement of parental consent.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.500
the reality is, most kids
won't tell their parents.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.500
many will resort to unsafe methods.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.400
some just secretly have the child.

22:38.400 --> 22:38.900
mr.shore-- 

22:38.900 --> 22:42.200
and if we're really going to exalt human life
here,it should be pointed out 

22:42.200 --> 22:47.600
that death associated with childbirth is ten times
as high as that associated with abortion.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.900
you're talking about the mother.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.700
the death rate of the unborn child
is 100%.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.400
- a fetus is not-- 
- hey, hey.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.600
i am not going there.

22:55.300 --> 22:59.100
like you say, mr.shore, let us not step
on the supreme court's moment.

22:59.300 --> 23:03.400
all i care about today is the maturity
and the best interests of kim.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.800
may i be heard on that, your honor?

23:06.900 --> 23:07.800
please.

23:11.300 --> 23:13.600
this is a young lady who...

23:14.500 --> 23:17.800
is in love with a boy one day,
and then over him the next.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.300
last week, she was going
to be a marine biologist, 

23:21.300 --> 23:26.600
and as of this morning,
she planned to invent software games.

23:28.500 --> 23:32.300
she's only at the beginning of discovering
who she is, like any teenager, and-- 

23:32.300 --> 23:35.900
but that process could be nipped in the bud
if she becomes a teenage mother.

23:35.900 --> 23:38.200
i know the values she was raised with.

23:38.700 --> 23:40.400
i know her values.

23:40.600 --> 23:45.500
and i feel that she will evolve to
be a person who is very much pro-life, 

23:46.300 --> 23:49.800
and this decision might
emotionally devastate her.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.100
you do not know her.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.100
i do.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.100
may i respond, your honor?

23:58.000 --> 23:58.900
okay.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.600
i know i'm just a kid.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.000
i had unprotected sex.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.700
what better example is there
of immaturity or recklessness?

24:09.100 --> 24:12.300
but i also know my family is poor.

24:12.900 --> 24:17.700
i will likely have to go on welfare like
nearly 80% of teen mothers are forced to do.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.900
i will not be able
to continue my education.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.600
i will not be able to provide for my child,
give her a good education.

24:25.300 --> 24:27.200
know the odds facing me.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.400
i know the odds facing this child
ould i carry her to term.

24:32.800 --> 24:37.600
and i believe terminating this pregnancy
is in my best interest.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.500
this is very difficult.

24:44.800 --> 24:48.200
you do strike me as a conscientious
and mature young woman.

24:48.900 --> 24:53.600
and yet, i find the mothers
of 15 year olds

24:53.600 --> 24:58.300
typically know those 15 year olds
better than those children know themselves.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.500
i'm gonna take time to think about this.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.500
we will adjourn until 2:00.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.000
mom, please.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.500
you need to listen to me, kim,
not him, not him.

25:10.500 --> 25:14.600
mrs.shu, as odd as th sounds, i'll
ask you not to talk about this to my client.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.300
why don't you talk to her, mr.shore?

25:17.800 --> 25:19.400
you think you know what's going on?

25:21.800 --> 25:23.200
you have no idea.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.300
my suggestion would be
to let carl step in.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.100
let him mitigate some of the damage.

25:47.700 --> 25:49.000
it's a little too late.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.100
he could certainly help you
with your testimony.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.600
i'm gonna testify in the narrative.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.100
it'll double as my closing.

25:55.100 --> 25:57.000
i think i can be more compelling
that way.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.300
more compelling?

25:58.700 --> 26:02.300
that would suggest you've been the least bit
compelling so far, which you haven't.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.100
i don't mean to come in here
driving a bus.

26:06.100 --> 26:06.700
jerry...

26:07.900 --> 26:09.400
you know i'm on your side.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.700
if you're to absolve yourself, 

26:11.800 --> 26:15.300
you cannot simply get up there
and say the man had it coming.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.300
there are disagreements, disputes,
altercations every day.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.700
adults respond as adults.

26:21.100 --> 26:23.500
they don't hurl pastries,
they do not punch, 

26:23.500 --> 26:28.800
and they most certainly do not engage
in victory war dances over fallen bodies.

26:29.300 --> 26:32.100
i think you have to examine
where your behavior came from 

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
and make the jury want to excuse
your rather inexcusable actions.

26:52.800 --> 26:55.000
it's not that i don't think
it's her right.

26:55.000 --> 26:55.700
i do.

26:55.700 --> 26:59.500
and god knows she seems smart enough
to make the decision, but...

27:00.400 --> 27:01.100
but?

27:02.600 --> 27:05.800
but as someone
who's exercised that right...

27:06.400 --> 27:10.700
this girl just strikes me
as too struggle-free.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.300
you say she was raised
in china?

27:14.300 --> 27:15.800
until three years ago.
why?

27:15.800 --> 27:17.200
and the baby's female?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.600
don't be ridiculous.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.900
shirley, female infanticide in china
has been going on for a thousand years.

27:22.900 --> 27:24.200
well, in china, yes,b--

27:24.200 --> 27:25.400
also here.

27:26.100 --> 27:28.100
i don't believe it.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.100
in the united states?

27:30.100 --> 27:31.300
i can show you the studies.

27:31.700 --> 27:37.700
since china's "one child per family" policy
was introduced in 1980, sex selection spiked.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.100
they want boys.

27:40.500 --> 27:41.500
ultrasounds?

27:41.600 --> 27:44.800
not a good thing
for female chinese babies.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.600
he started the altercation
by throwing the muffin.

27:56.300 --> 27:59.900
he ended it with a vicious punch,
shattering the victim's nose, 

27:59.900 --> 28:01.200
knocking him unconscious.

28:01.800 --> 28:06.500
and instead of showing any concern
or contrition, he danced, 

28:06.800 --> 28:11.300
did a little jig, sang a song and
said to the bystanders, "who's next?" 

28:13.200 --> 28:16.400
violent, unrepentant, criminal...

28:17.500 --> 28:20.100
that's the only way to describe
the conduct of the defendant.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.000
the legal definition would
be aggravated assault.

29:01.600 --> 29:04.200
i have various emotional...

29:04.600 --> 29:09.300
deficits, some of which are
consistent with asperger's syndrome, 

29:10.000 --> 29:13.300
others simply reflective
of my lack of social development.

29:13.800 --> 29:17.100
even in my late 40s,
i am often childlike.

29:17.400 --> 29:22.200
all my life, i have been
picked on for being...weird.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.700
the thing about being bullied...

29:32.600 --> 29:34.200
it stays with you.

29:35.700 --> 29:40.400
i-i certainly don't mean i think
about it every day, but it's there.

29:41.400 --> 29:45.600
and when picked on now, today,
as i was by mr.hellman, 

29:45.700 --> 29:49.900
it wasn't just his actions that
were causing me to boil up and react, 

29:49.900 --> 29:53.900
but the actions of many
over many, many years, because...

29:55.400 --> 29:58.400
it never goes away.

30:03.500 --> 30:06.200
most victims...

30:06.500 --> 30:08.500
cower, run away.

30:08.500 --> 30:09.500
i always did.

30:09.500 --> 30:14.800
i probably would've here except this time,
the abuse happened in front of somebody i'm...

30:16.500 --> 30:17.400
well...

30:20.800 --> 30:22.300
so i threw a muffin.

30:23.100 --> 30:25.200
a small sture, but for me...

30:27.600 --> 30:32.900
then suddenly mr.hellman came charging,
and i had to defend myself-- 

30:32.900 --> 30:36.500
something i had never done, something
i thought myself incapable of doing.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.200
and i squeezed my hand...

30:40.700 --> 30:44.100
into a fist and i threw a punch.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.900
it's a wonder i hit him--
i had my eyes closed-- 

30:47.300 --> 30:51.400
and by some miracle,
the bully went down.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.700
for the first time in my picked-on,

30:56.200 --> 31:00.600
ridiculed, taunted, laughed-at life...

31:02.200 --> 31:04.300
i had stood up for myself.

31:04.700 --> 31:06.000
and it was joyous.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.500
it was a feeling that...

31:11.200 --> 31:14.700
yes, i sang and i danced
and i challenged everybody else,

31:14.800 --> 31:17.500
quickly, before they tumbled
to the truth that i was afraid.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
i, um...

31:19.800 --> 31:22.200
i certainly regret the celebrating.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.200
i wish i could take that back.

31:24.600 --> 31:28.300
but i will never take back that punch.

31:30.400 --> 31:33.500
it was a punch that had
been coming for over 40 years.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.500
shirley, we're due back.

32:32.100 --> 32:33.300
come in for a second.

32:37.300 --> 32:38.300
sit, kim.

32:44.600 --> 32:49.200
your mother told alan in court that he had
no idea what was really going on here.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.800
what did she mean by that?

32:52.300 --> 32:53.400
i don't know.

32:53.900 --> 32:56.900
she was probably just
being a little irrational.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.600
mothers are like that.

32:59.100 --> 33:00.500
she didn't strike me that way.

33:01.500 --> 33:04.100
why are you having this abortion, kim?

33:05.700 --> 33:07.800
i think i've been clear on that.

33:07.800 --> 33:08.700
clear?

33:08.800 --> 33:09.700
yes.

33:10.300 --> 33:11.500
truthful?
i wonder.

33:11.500 --> 33:12.800
shirley, what's going on?

33:12.800 --> 33:14.900
you refer to the baby as "she." 
it's a girl?

33:14.900 --> 33:15.700
i don't know.

33:15.700 --> 33:18.700
i was just saying "she"
instead of "he" or "it." 

33:18.800 --> 33:20.000
does it matter?

33:20.600 --> 33:21.600
you tell me.

33:23.500 --> 33:26.400
shirley, unless it's a monday
crossword, i'm lousy at puzzles.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.700
kim's culture has a prerence
for male offspring.

33:31.400 --> 33:35.500
what your mother knows but isn't
telling us, at least not directly, is...

33:36.000 --> 33:40.100
you're aborting this baby
because it's a girl, aren't you, kim?

33:45.600 --> 33:47.000
i asked you a question.

33:47.600 --> 33:51.800
the reason i want to terminate
this pregnancy has no legal relevance.

33:52.800 --> 33:57.000
i suspect if the clinic learns that
this is about sex selection, that they'll-- 

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
it's not.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.400
i'm a teenager.
i'm simply unfit to be a mother.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
my personal reasons are
none of your business.

34:12.100 --> 34:13.300
we're gonna be late.

34:29.900 --> 34:35.500
mrs.shu, admittedly, i cannot possibly know
your daughter as well as you do.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.400
but as i said, 

34:37.400 --> 34:42.300
i cant help but be impressed
by her apparent clarity on this.

34:43.199 --> 34:45.500
and as a judge, as a woman, 

34:46.100 --> 34:49.300
i simply cannot impose upon
her the duty to carry through-- 

34:49.300 --> 34:51.300
- your honor--
- shirley.

34:59.700 --> 35:02.700
in addition to being
kim's advocate, i'm also...

35:04.200 --> 35:05.200
well, a woman.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.200
thank you, ms.schmidt.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.900
i suspected, but one can
never be too sure.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
it is my opinion that my client seeks
to terminate this pregnancy 

35:14.000 --> 35:15.900
because the child she is carrying
is female.

35:15.900 --> 35:16.900
that isn't true.

35:17.900 --> 35:19.300
is it true, mrs.shu?

35:24.200 --> 35:25.600
as a matter of public policy...

35:25.600 --> 35:26.600
this is not your call.

35:26.600 --> 35:30.400
the abortion laws were intended
to liberate women, t eradicate them.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.800
ms.schmidt, i think
you're out of line.

35:32.800 --> 35:36.200
your honor, sex selection,
at least for this purpose, 

35:36.400 --> 35:39.600
it should shock
the sensibility of this court.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.200
this woman is fired as my attorney.

35:42.300 --> 35:46.300
kim, i'm going to say something that perhaps
only a mother should get to say-- 

35:47.400 --> 35:50.300
sit down and be quiet.

35:54.700 --> 36:00.700
in india, almost half a million female fetuses
are aborted every year because...

36:01.300 --> 36:03.500
the gender is considered inferior.

36:03.800 --> 36:08.700
in china, it's become epidemic,
and according to our own census polls, 

36:09.100 --> 36:12.800
u.s.-born children of chinese parents
tend to be male.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.600
it's female infanticide.

36:14.600 --> 36:19.500
it is sexism.it is vile,
and i am not going to be part of it. i...

36:20.600 --> 36:22.300
i'm not going to stay silent

36:22.300 --> 36:27.600
while we let the abortion license be exploited
to accomplish the holocaust of women.

36:27.600 --> 36:32.900
if that gets me disbarred for betraying
a client or revealing a privilege...

36:35.600 --> 36:36.800
so be it.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
and what do you propose we do, ms.schmidt?

36:45.500 --> 36:49.500
that we add to our current abortion law
the right of the government 

36:49.500 --> 36:53.700
to investigate why a woman chooses
to terminate her pregnancy?

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
you really want to go down that road?

36:57.400 --> 37:01.000
subject pregnant teens
to interrogation and discovery?

37:02.500 --> 37:05.500
i admire your moral instinct here.

37:06.400 --> 37:10.000
but it is logistically unenforceable.

37:11.600 --> 37:17.600
i am convinced that the minor is mature enough
to make the decision, and the bypass is granted.

37:37.100 --> 37:39.000
unbelievable.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.900
- at sounds promising.
- not necessarily.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.800
alan told me he was bullied as a kid.

37:42.800 --> 37:43.500
the judge?

37:43.500 --> 37:44.500
by his mother.

37:44.800 --> 37:47.100
mr.espenson, please rise.

37:48.400 --> 37:52.000
mr.foreman, the jury has
reached a unanimous verdict?

37:52.200 --> 37:53.200
we have, your honor.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.500
what say you?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.500
"in the matter of
"the commonwealth vs.jerry espenson

37:58.500 --> 38:00.600
"on the charge of aggravated assault, "

38:00.900 --> 38:03.700
we the jury find the defendant
jerry espenson"...

38:04.000 --> 38:05.100
not guilty.

38:06.600 --> 38:10.500
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
thank you for your service.

38:10.500 --> 38:11.400
adjourned.

38:12.300 --> 38:13.100
wow.

38:13.100 --> 38:15.300
well, a little dance
would certainly be in order now.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.200
i think i'll pass on that.

38:17.800 --> 38:18.800
thank you, katie.

38:19.300 --> 38:23.200
if i hadn't taken your littllecture to heart,
i might not have closed that way.

38:23.700 --> 38:24.600
thank you.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.300
how about you let me take you
to dinner to celebrate?

38:27.700 --> 38:28.900
that i accept.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.000
lesson to you, bub.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.500
tell a friend.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.900
not necessary.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.200
you did win.

38:52.900 --> 38:54.300
did she have the procedure?

38:58.500 --> 38:59.600
i don't know.

39:02.600 --> 39:03.700
you know, denny...

39:04.400 --> 39:06.500
i am very pro-choice.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.900
i believe it's a woman's right.

39:09.200 --> 39:12.000
but from a sentific
and human perspective, 

39:12.700 --> 39:16.000
it's hard to argue that
life doesn't begin at conception...

39:16.400 --> 39:19.700
even if it's only in organism form.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.900
i suppose i am...

39:22.700 --> 39:25.000
desperate for roe to remain law...

39:25.600 --> 39:26.800
in part, maybe to...

39:28.200 --> 39:30.700
reaffirm my own moral position.

39:32.700 --> 39:35.000
how many procedures were you a part of?

39:36.600 --> 39:37.500
two.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.300
and they, um...

39:42.700 --> 39:43.700
haunt you?

39:45.700 --> 39:47.600
let's just say they weigh on me.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.400
do you really think...

39:53.600 --> 39:55.300
roe will be overturned?

39:56.200 --> 39:57.400
i don't know.

39:58.800 --> 40:03.600
you know, sarah palin talks about how proud she is
of her teenager for choosing to have the baby, 

40:03.600 --> 40:09.600
but the truth is, if sarah gets her way,
her daughter won't have a choice at all.

40:11.800 --> 40:15.900
if it comes before the supreme court,
probably it's game over.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.200
probably.

40:18.300 --> 40:20.400
but they do purport
to be tough on crime.

40:20.900 --> 40:22.100
what's that got to do with it?

40:22.100 --> 40:26.300
well, it's possible roe v.wade
has brought our crime rates down.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.400
how do you figure?

40:27.500 --> 40:30.000
well, roe became law in the '70s, 

40:30.100 --> 40:34.700
and studies have shown that the typical child
that went unborn after roe 

40:34.700 --> 40:37.900
was more likely to have come
from poor families, single parents-- 

40:37.900 --> 40:41.500
the very children most likely
to grow up to become criminals.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.300
after roe became law, many of
those children were being aborted.

40:46.800 --> 40:49.700
the would-be criminals of the '90s
weren't around

40:49.700 --> 40:52.400
because they were never born in the '70s.

40:53.900 --> 40:55.000
you're making all this up.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.300
i'm not making it up.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.100
there's a book-- "freakonomics." 

40:58.100 --> 40:58.900
read it.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.700
you still not reading?

41:01.800 --> 41:02.900
just newspapers.

41:03.100 --> 41:04.400
it's anti-american.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.700
so legalized abortion might
actually bring down the crime rate?

41:14.000 --> 41:15.100
wow.

41:20.200 --> 41:23.900
does that make it easier for you
to feel okay about your procedures?

41:30.400 --> 41:31.500
no.

42:00.600 --> 42:06.600
