00:08.917 --> 00:10.083
Hey, guys.

00:10.166 --> 00:11.625
- Oh, hey, Jack.
- Hey, Jack.

00:11.709 --> 00:12.709
How was your family reunion?

00:12.792 --> 00:13.750
Good.

00:21.792 --> 00:22.875
What's going on?

00:28.000 --> 00:28.959
Guys.

00:29.083 --> 00:30.500
Stop. Hey, stop!

00:31.792 --> 00:32.875
Talk to me, Lincoln.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.959
Well...

00:35.792 --> 00:37.917
It all started
when Jerry got his new locker.

00:39.667 --> 00:41.417
-
- Dude, I can't believe

00:41.500 --> 00:42.834
you got locker 138.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.542
This is where the prettiest girls
in school have their lockers.

00:45.625 --> 00:46.667
I know, dude.

00:46.750 --> 00:47.750
Yo.

00:49.709 --> 00:51.875
Hello, neighbor.

00:51.959 --> 00:54.083
Care to step into Club Jerry?

01:03.834 --> 01:04.917
Sweet.

01:07.291 --> 01:09.750
I've never been rejected
by a girl that pretty.

01:09.834 --> 01:11.667
I have a feeling
there's a lot more of that coming.

01:13.291 --> 01:15.834
Our school president, Frank,
kicked me off the bus today,

01:15.917 --> 01:17.875
so I had to walk to school.

01:17.959 --> 01:19.458
I got my first tardy.

01:19.542 --> 01:21.417
Awesome.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.625
Tardy party after school.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.041
I'll probably be a little late.

01:30.125 --> 01:31.250
Huh?

01:33.166 --> 01:35.000
No, no, no!

01:35.208 --> 01:38.542
Frank just had his Black Dragon goons
confiscate my locker.

01:38.834 --> 01:42.041
Well apparently, as president
you can do whatever you want.

01:42.125 --> 01:44.625
If you don't like it,
guys, the school election's in four days.

01:44.709 --> 01:45.834
Run against him.

01:45.917 --> 01:47.917
Gotta go. I'll see you guys
when I get back from my trip.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.583
- All right, see you, Jack.
- Have fun, man.

01:49.667 --> 01:50.917
Take it easy.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.583
Man, can you believe this?

01:56.291 --> 01:58.417
Just came to check out my new address.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.458
138.

01:59.542 --> 02:00.750
Best in school.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.875
I don't know who that is,

02:06.041 --> 02:08.250
but there's some skinny dude dancing
in my locker.

02:18.291 --> 02:22.041

02:59.917 --> 03:03.750
For too long we have lived
in Frank's shadow of fear.

03:04.166 --> 03:07.083
I say we need change.

03:07.625 --> 03:10.875
That's why I'm running for president,
because I'm not afraid.

03:11.667 --> 03:12.917
I'm also not afraid

03:13.000 --> 03:15.417
because Frank's
at an orthodontist appointment.

03:18.250 --> 03:21.875
I have some sweet number two pencils
with my name on them.

03:21.959 --> 03:23.166
Come and get 'em.

03:24.959 --> 03:28.083
Oh, remain calm, people.
There's one for everybody.

03:30.041 --> 03:32.291
- Nice. Free pencil.
- Yeah.

03:32.375 --> 03:33.458
You got my vote.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.125
I'm Jerry.

03:37.208 --> 03:38.291
Running for president.

03:38.375 --> 03:39.500
Free pizza!

03:41.125 --> 03:42.875
- Oh, ow!
-

03:42.959 --> 03:44.458
Gah!

03:47.083 --> 03:49.125
Nice. Free pizza.

03:49.208 --> 03:50.333
You got my vote.

03:52.959 --> 03:54.583
Jerry, you can't run for president.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.792
I'm running for president.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.750
Ooh. This is awkward.

03:58.834 --> 04:00.000
See?

04:01.917 --> 04:04.750
Well, dude, how do you expect to win
if your pencil's not even number one.

04:06.291 --> 04:08.500
Surely the good citizens of Seaford High

04:08.583 --> 04:12.125
will not let their vote be swayed
by a mere slice of pizza.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.291
Oh, no, no. It's not just pizza.

04:14.709 --> 04:15.959
I got froyo, too.

04:16.542 --> 04:18.375
Whoa!

04:19.291 --> 04:20.709
Gah!

04:23.250 --> 04:26.583
Pencils, pizza, froyo?

04:26.875 --> 04:28.667
I love politics!

04:33.000 --> 04:34.333
You are looking at the man

04:34.417 --> 04:36.625
who's been asked
to direct <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>

04:36.709 --> 04:38.417
at the Seaford Community Theater.

04:38.917 --> 04:40.959
Kim, would you like
to be my assistant director?

04:41.041 --> 04:43.166
Absolutely! I love the theater.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.250
Excellent.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.625
Your duties will be important and vast.

04:46.834 --> 04:49.667
One day you might be picking up Brad Pitt
from the airport,

04:49.750 --> 04:52.625
the next, you will be washing my socks.

04:54.083 --> 04:57.208
May I present the next president
of Seaford High,

04:57.291 --> 04:58.583
Milton Krupnick!

05:01.875 --> 05:03.583
What's with the suit?

05:03.667 --> 05:04.834
As his campaign manager,

05:04.917 --> 05:07.875
I'm giving him a presidential makeover.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.083
Julie loaned me her grandfather's suit.

05:10.208 --> 05:12.709
Don't you think it makes me
look like Abraham Lincoln?

05:12.792 --> 05:16.542
Yes, and smell like muscle rub
and sardines.

05:18.709 --> 05:19.959
<i>Well, Milton,</i>

05:20.041 --> 05:21.792
I didn't plan on running against you,

05:21.875 --> 05:24.291
but I don't start something
without finishing it.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.291
And I've got a campaign manager, too.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.500
Kim.

05:28.834 --> 05:30.250
I'm busy with the play.

05:30.792 --> 05:32.250
Milton.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.625
I'm running against you.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.709
Oh, Rudy.

05:35.792 --> 05:37.125
I'm 30 years old.

05:39.709 --> 05:40.959
Eddie.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.500
I did not see this coming.

05:43.583 --> 05:44.500
I'm in!

05:44.583 --> 05:47.000
<i>♪ And no matter how much
I chop and punch ♪</i>

05:47.083 --> 05:50.083
<i>♪ It's not as cool
As kickin' it with you ♪</i>

05:50.166 --> 05:52.041
Is this where
you're holding the auditions?

05:52.583 --> 05:54.291
Uh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.166
I don't think you're right for the part.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.375
Oh, no.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.792
Then how about...

06:00.291 --> 06:02.166
Me!

06:02.250 --> 06:03.417
I fooled you.

06:04.792 --> 06:06.208
And do you know why?

06:06.291 --> 06:08.417
Because you're a rich, eccentric nutcase?

06:08.500 --> 06:09.959
Well, yes.

06:10.041 --> 06:14.291
But also because I am a great actor!

06:15.750 --> 06:18.458
"What light through yonder window breaks?

06:18.709 --> 06:22.792
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun."

06:24.417 --> 06:25.875
Well...

06:25.959 --> 06:27.208
I'm your boss.

06:27.291 --> 06:28.125
You're in!

06:28.208 --> 06:29.917
Huzzah!

06:30.667 --> 06:32.458
All we need now is a Juliet.

06:32.542 --> 06:35.291
You parked your peacock in a loading zone.

06:35.375 --> 06:36.542
Again.

06:36.625 --> 06:37.834
You ride a peacock?

06:37.917 --> 06:39.625
It's giant.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.834
<i>Every time you show up,</i>

06:41.917 --> 06:44.625
you make a scene,
and I'm getting pretty sick of it.

06:44.709 --> 06:46.667
Oh, good lord.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.417
So real, so honest.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.709
So full of verve.

06:50.792 --> 06:53.250
Oh, I'm stupid with verve.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.834
You must be my leading lady.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.250
Whoa. Excuse me.

07:00.333 --> 07:04.208
I am the director of this play
and I will say who Juliet is.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.250
I'm your boss.

07:05.291 --> 07:07.500
We have found our Juliet!

07:07.583 --> 07:09.458
Huzzah!

07:11.458 --> 07:13.166
And in conclusion,

07:13.250 --> 07:15.750
this is what will happen
if you don't vote for me.

07:21.083 --> 07:22.125
Thank you.

07:23.583 --> 07:24.667
Okay.

07:25.750 --> 07:29.834
And now for the candidate,
who I am in no way partial to,

07:29.917 --> 07:32.291
Milton, my cuddle bunny, Krupnick.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.291
Friends!

07:38.542 --> 07:40.291
The last time you voted for Frank,

07:40.375 --> 07:42.375
you did it so you wouldn't get beaten up,

07:42.709 --> 07:44.959
but he beat you up anyway.

07:48.250 --> 07:51.709
I say the dark days of fear are over!

07:51.792 --> 07:54.250
And the dawn of change is upon us.

07:58.166 --> 07:59.375
You think I can do this?

07:59.458 --> 08:01.792
Yeah, just read the speech
I wrote for you.

08:02.375 --> 08:04.000
- Good job.
-

08:04.083 --> 08:06.083
<i>Uh, thank you.</i>

08:06.625 --> 08:08.834
Dude, this is your mother's shopping list.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.333
Just make it work.

08:12.417 --> 08:14.500
Oh... Okay.

08:17.625 --> 08:18.750
"Potatoes,

08:20.166 --> 08:21.583
orange juice,

08:21.667 --> 08:23.625
light bulbs, and eggs."

08:25.291 --> 08:26.250
<i>Uh...</i>

08:26.291 --> 08:29.291
"Cream cheese, low fat and whipped."

08:31.166 --> 08:32.125
Uh...

08:32.458 --> 08:33.875
And in conclusion,

08:33.959 --> 08:35.375
I'd like to say...

08:37.291 --> 08:39.250
non-sheer pantyhose!

08:39.291 --> 08:42.667
Yeah! Whoo! Good job! Yeah! Whoo!

08:46.792 --> 08:48.750
Milton doesn't shower after gym class.

08:53.542 --> 08:55.125
We've got big problems.

08:55.208 --> 08:57.625
I read most of <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

08:57.709 --> 08:59.458
and this Shakespeare guy is a hack.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.667
But if I make some changes,
I can save this show.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.291
Do you really want to change it?

09:05.375 --> 09:06.375
I mean, it's a classic.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.000
A classic snoozefest.

09:08.083 --> 09:10.417
Rudy, I was just at lunch

09:10.542 --> 09:12.834
and I heard that the theater critic
from the <i>Seaford Herald,</i>

09:12.917 --> 09:15.583
Vic DeBlaze, is coming to our play!

09:15.667 --> 09:17.291
Oh, no. He hates everything.

09:17.417 --> 09:19.709
Oh, Rudy, calm down.
You're just panicking.

09:19.792 --> 09:20.959
No, I'm not.

09:21.041 --> 09:23.291
His last review of the ballet said

09:23.375 --> 09:26.917
the lead stumbled around the stage
like a dying pelican.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Really?

09:28.083 --> 09:30.125
Yeah, and that was
his 8-year-old daughter.

09:31.333 --> 09:32.834
We got work to do, people!

09:42.125 --> 09:43.583
How could this happen?

09:43.709 --> 09:45.208
There was nothing I could do

09:45.291 --> 09:48.542
once Jerry told everyone
that you don't shower after gym class.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.500
Don't judge me.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.375
That water is ice cold,

09:52.667 --> 09:54.208
and there are boys in there.

09:55.583 --> 09:57.875
I can't believe
Jerry's gonna win this thing.

09:59.083 --> 10:01.500
That backstabbing blabbermouth.

10:04.417 --> 10:07.000
You know how much trouble you're in
if you win this thing?

10:07.959 --> 10:11.959
First of all, you're gonna need to speak
to my campaign manager.

10:12.041 --> 10:13.834
Take it easy.

10:15.709 --> 10:16.875
Ew!

10:17.250 --> 10:18.709
What's that smell?

10:21.333 --> 10:22.834
Showerless, not powerless.

10:22.917 --> 10:25.333
Showerless, not powerless.
Showerless, not powerless.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.500
Milton, look!

10:26.583 --> 10:28.250
It's the other kids
who don't shower after gym.

10:28.333 --> 10:30.041
- They're voting for you.
-

10:34.250 --> 10:35.709
I don't believe it.

10:35.792 --> 10:38.000
<i>-
- Milton, the polls are closed.</i>

10:38.083 --> 10:39.000
You won!

10:39.083 --> 10:40.000
- Ah!
-

10:40.375 --> 10:44.083
Because of you,
we have overcome locker room ridicule.

10:44.166 --> 10:46.542
Come to me, you unwashed masses.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so close. Back up.

10:50.375 --> 10:52.083
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

10:54.625 --> 10:55.625
Krupnick!

10:55.709 --> 10:58.583
When you step off the school grounds,
you're gonna get it.

10:58.667 --> 10:59.875
Uh...

11:00.333 --> 11:01.208
You know--

11:01.291 --> 11:02.375
Really?

11:02.458 --> 11:04.166
The thing is that, uh--

11:04.250 --> 11:05.250
This pen?

11:06.375 --> 11:07.750
It's a spy camera.

11:08.750 --> 11:09.709
Yeah.

11:09.792 --> 11:12.875
Jack's always watching.

11:13.375 --> 11:14.792
Hey, Jack.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.709
Just talking to Milton,
our beloved new president.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.417
I hate pens that watch me.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.583
There he is.

11:26.667 --> 11:29.041
<i>El presidente.</i>

11:29.125 --> 11:31.792
Saw you kicked the Black Dragons
out of locker 138.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.333
Come on, give me some.

11:33.417 --> 11:35.542
You're not getting the locker, Jerry.

11:36.041 --> 11:37.375
You betrayed me.

11:37.458 --> 11:40.834
Took my secret and used it to embarrass me
in front of the whole school.

11:41.458 --> 11:42.375
We're done.

11:42.792 --> 11:43.750
What?

11:43.834 --> 11:45.500
Who's gonna move into 138?

11:45.959 --> 11:47.166
I'll give you a hint.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.458
You know, Rudy,

11:55.542 --> 11:58.583
do you really think you should have made
all these changes to <i>Romeo and Juliet?</i>

11:58.917 --> 12:00.792
Trust me, if Shakespeare were alive today,

12:00.875 --> 12:03.500
these are exactly the kinds of changes
he would have made.

12:03.750 --> 12:04.709
<i>All right!</i>

12:04.792 --> 12:07.750
Load the old woman into the cannon
and wait for my command.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.375
And you,
put those lemurs next to the cougar.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.625
We're gonna need more lemurs.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.375
All right! From the top, people.

12:23.291 --> 12:28.291
"Romeo, oh, Romeo,
wherefore art thou, Romeo?"

12:30.625 --> 12:33.709
I art saving the universe, baby.

12:34.542 --> 12:36.792
Die, alien slime!

12:41.792 --> 12:44.083
My space laser is jammed again.

12:44.166 --> 12:45.917
I can't work like this, Rudy.

12:46.458 --> 12:47.875
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

12:47.959 --> 12:50.041
Why is Romeo shooting me?

12:50.875 --> 12:54.709
Because you're an evil alien clone, duh.

12:54.792 --> 12:56.125
We've been over this, people.

12:56.417 --> 12:57.792
Fine.

12:57.875 --> 12:59.667
By the way, did you know that Bobby's name

12:59.750 --> 13:01.792
is above mine on the marquee?

13:01.875 --> 13:04.959
About that, did you know her name
is on the marquee?

13:10.041 --> 13:11.208
Hey!

13:11.291 --> 13:13.834
You guys, knock it off!

13:15.583 --> 13:19.250
This isn't about marquees, or aliens,
and special effects.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.291
This is community theater.

13:21.375 --> 13:22.583
It's about community.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.500
I mean, we have to believe in each other

13:24.583 --> 13:26.250
and the material, Rudy.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.041
Maybe she's right.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.792
You know what I say?

13:31.875 --> 13:34.458
Forget Vic DeBlaze.

13:34.542 --> 13:37.750
We will do this play
the way it was meant to be done.

13:38.792 --> 13:42.125
We will use our raw talent
to bring this show to life.

13:42.208 --> 13:45.583
And we will set
the theatrical world on fire.

13:45.667 --> 13:46.834
On fire!

13:46.917 --> 13:49.750
<i>-</i>

13:51.417 --> 13:52.875
Okay, people. That's a five.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.125
Oh, great.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.709
You're stuck on cleaning detail, too?

14:03.792 --> 14:05.667
This is the worst form of detention.

14:06.375 --> 14:07.291
What'd you do?

14:08.041 --> 14:09.792
Got caught trying to get to first base

14:09.875 --> 14:11.834
with the CPR doll in the Health Office.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.500
Nice.

14:14.583 --> 14:15.542
How about you?

14:15.625 --> 14:17.417
Got caught trying to get to first base

14:17.500 --> 14:19.500
with the statue of Amelia Earhart
in the library.

14:19.583 --> 14:21.375
Nice.

14:21.875 --> 14:23.792
Yeah, Milton ratted me out.

14:23.875 --> 14:25.208
Since he became president

14:25.291 --> 14:27.166
he thinks he's so much better
than everyone else.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.417
He's even got VIP seating
at the Seaford Community Theater

14:29.500 --> 14:30.709
for Rudy's play tonight.

14:30.792 --> 14:32.709
I saw <i>Man of La Mancha</i> there.

14:32.792 --> 14:35.291
It was to die for.

14:36.750 --> 14:39.458
I guess if Milton's seeing it,
Jack's seeing it, too.

14:40.333 --> 14:41.458
Wait, what are you talking about?

14:41.542 --> 14:44.250
Milton's got this James Bond pen
in his front pocket.

14:44.291 --> 14:47.291
Jack's watching over him 24-7.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.166
What?

14:51.250 --> 14:52.917
Dude, he's got no spy pen.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.709
He just told you that,
so you'd think Jack's protecting him.

14:55.792 --> 14:57.959
No, Jack's at his family reunion
in Colorado.

14:59.667 --> 15:02.250
So you're telling me
Jack's five states away?

15:02.333 --> 15:03.834
And Milton's going to be
off school grounds

15:03.917 --> 15:05.375
where I'm free to pummel him?

15:06.041 --> 15:07.750
Well, yeah. That's exactly what I'm say--

15:07.834 --> 15:09.875
Oh, really, Jerry? Really?

15:13.709 --> 15:15.166
<i>-</i>

15:16.375 --> 15:18.500
Looks like I've got a play to catch.

15:21.792 --> 15:23.291
Let me out!

15:23.375 --> 15:24.750
Somebody!

15:26.959 --> 15:28.291
Jerry?

15:29.583 --> 15:31.000
I was in the music room

15:31.083 --> 15:33.667
when I heard what sounded like
a little girl crying.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.375
It was probably
because she was really, really scared,

15:38.458 --> 15:41.583
and didn't know if she was ever
gonna see her mommy again.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.250
<i>-</i>

15:51.208 --> 15:52.875
But she's all right now.

15:54.875 --> 15:56.166
Come on, Eddie.

15:56.250 --> 15:57.834
We got a president to save.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.375
A night at the theater
is exactly the flame

16:08.458 --> 16:09.917
that will kindle my spirits.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.667
Uh-huh.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.125
Good night! Good night!

16:14.208 --> 16:16.417
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

16:17.917 --> 16:20.083
That I shall say good night

16:20.166 --> 16:22.834
till it be morrow.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.875
Oh, thanks a lot, Kim.

16:30.959 --> 16:33.792
"Romeo doesn't need to be
an alien hunter."

16:33.875 --> 16:35.834
DeBlaze is out there in a coma.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.917
Well, he ain't the only one.

16:43.375 --> 16:44.542
Juliet.

16:44.625 --> 16:45.959
Juliet.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.375
Juliet!

16:50.625 --> 16:52.250
Poke her with your sword.

17:01.750 --> 17:02.917
There he is!

17:03.041 --> 17:03.959
<i>Let's get him.</i>

17:10.083 --> 17:11.125
Ow.

17:11.208 --> 17:12.542
Ow, stop poking me.

17:13.041 --> 17:15.625
You can't act when you're asleep.

17:15.792 --> 17:17.542
You can't act when you're awake.

17:19.375 --> 17:21.917
-
- Oh, that's it.

17:25.291 --> 17:28.125
Juliet is also a security guard?

17:28.208 --> 17:30.083
I didn't see that coming.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.625
You love him.
Stop trying to beat him senseless.

17:37.709 --> 17:39.625
Get this maniac off my face!

17:39.709 --> 17:40.959
I'm trying!

17:41.041 --> 17:42.750
Come on, Bobby. Let go of Joan!

17:44.917 --> 17:46.250
What are you two doing here?

17:46.333 --> 17:47.291
We gotta save Milton.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.125
Frank's on his way down here
to beat him up.

17:49.208 --> 17:50.875
Oh, we might be too late!

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Holy Hannah!

17:53.083 --> 17:54.625
- They're gonna get Lincoln!
- Oh!

17:58.208 --> 17:59.458
Ha, ha!

18:01.875 --> 18:04.250
I probably shouldn't have done that.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.500
Quick. Get out of here.

18:06.959 --> 18:09.750
Mary Todd, save yourself!

18:13.542 --> 18:15.166
Whoa! Milton!

18:15.250 --> 18:16.709
- Aah!
-

18:16.792 --> 18:18.083
Mary Todd!

18:22.291 --> 18:25.417
Juliet, save thouself!

18:25.500 --> 18:29.250
I shan't leave you to die, Romeo.

18:29.333 --> 18:32.166
I don't think I'd die.
Probably just pull a hammie, you know.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.875
Whoa!

18:55.792 --> 18:57.250
Ohh!

19:00.417 --> 19:01.792
Oh, no, you don't.

19:32.542 --> 19:35.291
Bravo! Bravo!

19:39.250 --> 19:41.583
Rudy! I loved it.

19:41.667 --> 19:44.291
<i>In fact,
I'm coming back to see it tomorrow.</i>

19:44.417 --> 19:46.458
Don't change a thing.

19:46.542 --> 19:48.417
<i>Ha, ha!</i>

19:48.500 --> 19:49.667
You got it, Vic.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.875
Okay, so now all this makes sense...

19:56.083 --> 19:57.500
Except for one thing.

19:57.583 --> 19:59.625
Eddie, why are you dressed
like a mattress?

19:59.709 --> 20:01.041
Oh, I've got to get going.

20:01.125 --> 20:03.667
I've got a job handing out flyers
for Ned's Beds.

20:03.750 --> 20:04.625
Later.

20:04.709 --> 20:05.792
- Bye, guys.
Bye.

20:05.875 --> 20:07.166
See you, Eddie.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.250
Look, man.

20:12.333 --> 20:13.625
I owe you an apology.

20:13.709 --> 20:16.166
I shouldn't have used
your locker room secret against you.

20:16.667 --> 20:17.834
Well...

20:17.917 --> 20:20.959
What matters is that you were there
when I was about to be attacked.

20:21.083 --> 20:22.709
Thanks.

20:24.667 --> 20:25.834
What's this?

20:25.917 --> 20:28.083
It's a presidential decree.

20:28.166 --> 20:31.667
Locker 138 will be yours
till the day you graduate.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.625
Dude, these next ten years
are gonna be awesome!

20:35.709 --> 20:38.166
- Whoo!
<i>- ♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

20:41.166 --> 20:42.750
All right, come on out, Bobby.

20:47.291 --> 20:49.333
Now, Bobby,
I'm giving you a very big break

20:49.417 --> 20:50.875
by letting you be in this play.

20:50.959 --> 20:54.083
And I'm not gonna let you down, Pilgrim.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.917
Now, don't think of yourself
as a cowboy on a horse.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.041
Think of yourself
as a cowboy on a horse...

21:03.125 --> 21:04.291
On a trampoline.

21:04.375 --> 21:06.500
Now bounce, Bobby, bounce!

21:06.583 --> 21:08.750
<i>You got it, Rudy.
-</i>

21:08.834 --> 21:10.917
<i>Jump, Sapphire. Jump!</i>

21:11.000 --> 21:12.792
<i>-</i>

21:12.875 --> 21:13.834
Higher.

21:13.917 --> 21:15.750
<i>-</i>

21:15.834 --> 21:16.709
Higher.

21:18.375 --> 21:19.333
Higher!

21:24.000 --> 21:25.375
Too high.

21:26.834 --> 21:29.375
Kim, could you get Bobby and the horse
out of the ceiling?

21:29.458 --> 21:30.542
I have a lunch.
