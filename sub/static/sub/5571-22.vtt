00:00.001 --> 00:03.502
Gibbs:
<i> Previously on</i> NCIS...

00:03.504 --> 00:05.104
Bishop:
British prison break has left

00:05.106 --> 00:06.572
two convicted felons loose.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.540
McGee:
Jacob Scott. Former MI6.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.776
Caught selling
U.S. nuclear intel to Russia.

00:10.778 --> 00:14.046
NCIS are the ones who put
Jacob Scott in prison.

00:14.048 --> 00:16.648
I asked homeland senior division
chief morrow to join us.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.417
Formerly director of NCIS.
Gibbs:<i> McGee.</i>

00:18.419 --> 00:19.585
Got a network
security alert.

00:19.587 --> 00:20.719
What the hell is it?

00:20.721 --> 00:22.254
Someone accessed our records

00:22.256 --> 00:23.455
using a duress password.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.723
What did he get away with?

00:24.725 --> 00:26.258
McGee:
It's a single file. It's old.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.726
What was the operation in '02?

00:27.728 --> 00:29.128
Juniper strike.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.196
Russian national,
nika razin.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.431
She was his wife.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.665
Boss, this is a hit list?

00:33.667 --> 00:36.068
Where would he start, Gibbs?
Tom. Tom morrow.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.470
Fornell:<i> The man who ordered</i>
<i> the whole damn thing.</i>

00:46.313 --> 00:48.330
(Baby fussing)

00:48.331 --> 00:50.348
Marshall: I'll be back
real soon, okay?

00:50.351 --> 00:52.551
Daddy loves you, baby girl.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.552
Shh.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.820
Anne Marshall:
David?

00:54.822 --> 00:57.089
The Van's here.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.565
Listen...

01:06.567 --> 01:09.268
Six months is gonna fly by.

01:10.638 --> 01:11.837
No, it's not.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.772
Yeah, you're right.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.809
The pizza in Iraq tastes
like ketchup on cardboard.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.644
(Quiet, wry laugh)

01:20.347 --> 01:23.549
I need you to take care of your
mom and sister while I'm gone.

01:23.551 --> 01:24.716
Hmm?

01:24.718 --> 01:27.686
Protect them for me.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.188
I will.

01:33.094 --> 01:35.127
(Sighs gently)

01:35.129 --> 01:36.528
I love you, buddy.

01:39.433 --> 01:43.168
(Anxious breathing)

01:43.170 --> 01:44.303
Protect them for me.

01:44.305 --> 01:48.240
(Anxious breathing)
Dad:<i> Protect them...</i>

01:56.450 --> 01:58.750
Put it down.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.693
I had to do it.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.463
¶ ¶

02:39.793 --> 02:42.661
anyone want this?
I'm not hungry.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.696
You're bishop.
You're always hungry.
Eh...

02:44.698 --> 02:46.665
Not after funerals.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.167
Anyone else
find it weird

02:48.169 --> 02:49.701
that tom morrow
had so many friends?

02:49.703 --> 02:51.403
McGee:
Seriously.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.671
I mean, he wasn't exactly

02:52.673 --> 02:54.806
the warm, welcoming type.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.375
He always was with me.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.310
And me.
Me, as well.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.511
Really?
Mm-hmm.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.646
Ducky: Yep.
Abby: Me, too.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.281
Give me those waffles.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.283
Abby:
I prefer to celebrate life,

03:04.285 --> 03:05.584
instead of mourning it.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.519
So, like, when I die,
i want you guys

03:07.521 --> 03:09.221
to throw an all-night rager.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.656
When do you think
Tony will be back

03:10.658 --> 03:11.857
from his secret mission?

03:11.859 --> 03:13.225
Not a secret, Abby.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.493
Gibbs sent him to england

03:14.495 --> 03:16.195
to track down leads
on Jacob Scott.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.663
After killing morrow,

03:17.665 --> 03:19.398
every agency
is after Scott.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.234
Only so many places
he can hide.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.270
Ah! There you are.

03:25.272 --> 03:26.939
Hey, duck. Not staying.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.507
Grab your gear.
We got a home invasion

03:28.509 --> 03:29.708
in Jefferson county.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.709
Gibbs...

03:30.711 --> 03:31.910
Breakfast is the most important

03:31.912 --> 03:33.378
meal of the day.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.780
I insist that
you have something.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.585
(Slurps) Mmm!

03:45.392 --> 03:46.959
Officer fields: Minor's name
is Henry Marshall.

03:46.961 --> 03:48.360
Father's a marine,

03:48.362 --> 03:50.395
deployed in Iraq
for the last six months.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.232
When we found that out,
we got on the phone to you.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.766
Kid says he was
getting ready for school.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.935
Heard someone breaking in.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.904
Saw the intruder
entering with a knife,

03:58.906 --> 04:00.672
ran to his dad's safe for a gun,
shot the perp.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.609
(Siren approaching,
helicopter whirring)

04:03.611 --> 04:05.744
Where was he hit?
Left leg.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.479
Neighbor heard the shot.
Called 911.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.417
Bishop:
Gibbs...

04:12.419 --> 04:13.685
Got a bullet.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.988
Must've gone
through and through.

04:15.990 --> 04:18.423
Or he was grazed.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.425
Either way, it was enough
to send him packing.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.361
My third attempted
smash-and-grab this week.

04:22.363 --> 04:25.030
Likely looking for drug money.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.365
Is that a problem
in this area?

04:26.367 --> 04:27.733
Typically, no.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.868
A few blocks over,
it's a different story.

04:29.870 --> 04:30.969
How's Henry doing?

04:30.971 --> 04:32.437
EMT is checking him out.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.907
14 years old.
He's pretty shaken up.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.310
You know, you look at him,

04:38.312 --> 04:40.979
you wish you could
take it all away.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.653
I had to go to work
early this morning.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.656
Henry was going to get a ride
to school from a friend.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.892
(Sighs)
I wasn't home when it happened.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.460
Well, we're going to need him

04:55.462 --> 04:57.529
to come down to NCIS
and give a statement.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.531
He already talked
to the police.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.067
We prefer to hear it firsthand.

05:02.069 --> 05:05.003
I'm sorry, but he is in no
condition to talk to...

05:05.005 --> 05:07.005
Mom...

05:07.007 --> 05:09.007
I can do it.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.610
They need to catch this guy.

05:14.682 --> 05:15.881
Okay.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.983
Wait-- can we pick up Cora?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.351
Cora your sister?

05:19.353 --> 05:20.419
She's at daycare.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.687
It's out of the way.

05:21.689 --> 05:22.954
I-i don't want to
keep you waiting.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.725
Tell you what, Henry,
I'll drive.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.428
We'll pick your sister up
along the way, okay?

05:35.602 --> 05:37.502
And the crime scene's
been processed?

05:37.504 --> 05:39.771
Home invasion foiled by a kid.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.106
It could have ended up
a whole lot worse.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.107
Hmm.
(Knocking on door)

05:42.109 --> 05:43.375
Yeah.

05:43.377 --> 05:44.576
Ah! Agent fornell,

05:44.578 --> 05:45.744
thank you for joining us.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.346
What's he doing here?

05:47.348 --> 05:48.747
Good to see you, too.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.916
How come you never responded
to my snapchat?

05:50.918 --> 05:52.984
Leon, seriously,
what's he doing here?

05:52.986 --> 05:55.487
It's a joint update
on our progress overseas.

05:55.489 --> 05:58.457
Agent DiNozzo's been working
alongside MI6

05:58.459 --> 06:00.125
in their search for Jacob Scott.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.694
DiNozzo... with
British secret intelligence?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.463
Mm-hmm.
I can just hear

06:04.465 --> 06:06.665
the endearing bond impressions.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.968
So where exactly is
"the spy who loved me"?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.636
Well, he left London
this morning.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.605
He's following up a lead
in Russia, which...

06:13.607 --> 06:15.640
Brings me to why you're here.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.811
It's the top sheet

06:19.813 --> 06:21.947
Scott stole
on operation Juniper strike.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.648
It's the raid that
killed his wife.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.550
That's Scott's hit list?

06:25.552 --> 06:26.852
List is incomplete.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.754
Our files only
divulge the name

06:28.756 --> 06:30.822
of the NCIS agents involved.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.491
The identities
of the MI6 operatives

06:32.493 --> 06:33.859
were redacted.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.660
By whom?

06:35.662 --> 06:38.830
By the chief of MI6,
Jessica terdei.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.899
She fell off the grid
after her retirement

06:40.901 --> 06:43.135
in 2008, but agent DiNozzo

06:43.137 --> 06:44.870
left us intel
on her whereabouts,

06:44.872 --> 06:47.072
with an MI6 contact in London.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.807
I'm ready when you are.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.575
London?

06:50.577 --> 06:52.511
Glad I caught up
with<i> Sherlock</i> over the weekend.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.512
Gibbs...

06:53.514 --> 06:54.913
You already
have a case here.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.481
You won't be going anywhere.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.950
So... I'll be hunting

06:58.952 --> 07:00.786
the hound of the
baskervilles on my own?

07:00.788 --> 07:02.120
Not exactly.

07:04.491 --> 07:05.924
Tom morrow served this office

07:05.926 --> 07:07.692
with distinction.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.661
Scott took out
one of our own.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.696
And I want answers.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.033
Our plane leaves
in an hour...

07:15.035 --> 07:16.868
Dr. Watson.

07:30.184 --> 07:31.116
(Quiet laugh)

07:31.118 --> 07:32.551
No, Tony, I am not interested

07:32.553 --> 07:33.852
in a Russian mail-order bride,

07:33.854 --> 07:35.153
but thank you.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.521
What do you mean, "why"?

07:36.523 --> 07:38.790
'Cause I'm with Delilah.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.192
Yes, it's serious.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.461
<i> Dasvidaniya,</i> Tony.

07:42.463 --> 07:43.795
What's the latest?

07:43.797 --> 07:46.131
Tony is tailing Jacob Scott's
father-in-law.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.633
Where?
At a Russian bath house.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.903
Mm! At least he didn't
send us any visuals.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.905
(Both cell phones
blipping, chiming)

07:53.907 --> 07:54.940
Oh!

07:54.942 --> 07:57.742
I can't un-see that.
Spoke too soon.

07:57.744 --> 07:58.777
Give me an update.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.512
Uh, Abby got a DNA match

08:00.514 --> 08:02.481
to the blood found
at the marshalls' house.

08:03.717 --> 08:06.651
Our intruder
is Mickey Doyle, 36,

08:06.653 --> 08:08.787
an ex-con and violent offender.

08:08.789 --> 08:09.921
Been suspected in a number

08:09.923 --> 08:11.890
of drug-related
murders in the area.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.758
Doyle's last known
address is his rv;

08:13.760 --> 08:15.627
matches the description

08:15.629 --> 08:17.762
of the one seen on
Marshall's street

08:17.764 --> 08:19.898
before the break-in.
Got a bolo out on that.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.566
Checked with all local
hospitals.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.134
No patients matching
Doyle's description

08:23.136 --> 08:26.037
have been treated
for a GSW to the leg.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.873
Robbery isn't Doyle's mo.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.608
You think he broke in
for another reason?

08:29.610 --> 08:31.276
What do we know
about the family?

08:31.278 --> 08:33.144
Before moving to
West Virginia eight months ago,

08:33.146 --> 08:35.280
they were stationed
in California.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.916
Anne Marshall worked as

08:37.918 --> 08:40.719
an assistant district
attorney in San Diego,

08:40.721 --> 08:42.954
where she had quite
an impressive conviction record.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.256
What about the husband?

08:45.659 --> 08:46.958
Master sergeant
David Marshall.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.694
He has been
training Iraqi troops

08:49.696 --> 08:52.931
at al taqaddum airbase
for the last six months.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.666
Scheduled
to come home last month,

08:54.668 --> 08:57.102
but his deployment was extended
due to a security issue.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.103
Yeah, we haven't been
in contact with him yet.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.104
Base's comms are down.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.305
A special ops marine,

09:00.307 --> 09:01.973
and a former Ada.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.776
It's possible something in
their past made them a target?

09:04.778 --> 09:06.111
Find out.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.581
Anne Marshall:
<i> I don't think my work</i>

09:09.583 --> 09:10.982
made us a target.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.250
I'm a receptionist.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.653
People I deal with
don't even know my name.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.855
We thought you were a lawyer.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.924
Not since we moved
from California.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.258
To practice here,

09:20.260 --> 09:22.260
I have to pass
the West Virginia bar.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.963
But your husband must get
reassigned all the time.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.131
There's no provision

09:26.133 --> 09:27.265
for military spouses?

09:27.267 --> 09:28.833
Depends on which state.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.035
Hmm.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.269
(Baby fussing)
Anne: Okay, here we go.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.004
Good girl.

09:33.006 --> 09:36.341
Honestly, I would choose
to stay home if I could,

09:36.343 --> 09:38.877
but when my sister was ill,

09:38.879 --> 09:43.114
we took on her medical bills,
and it drained our savings.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.750
So I work during the day,

09:45.752 --> 09:48.286
and I study for
the bar at night.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.890
I never meant it
to affect my children this way.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.259
Do you know who
broke into our house?

09:54.261 --> 09:56.294
Yeah, we do.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.297
His name is Mickey Doyle.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.299
Is that him, honey?

10:01.301 --> 10:03.835
Yeah.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.304
Have either of you
seen this man before today?

10:06.306 --> 10:08.907
No.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.241
If he's after us,

10:10.243 --> 10:12.010
does that mean
he's going to come back?

10:12.012 --> 10:14.879
McGee: Well, we don't exactly
know what's going on.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.314
So until we do,
we're going to have

10:16.316 --> 10:18.183
an agent posted
outside your home.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.753
Does my dad know
what happened?

10:21.755 --> 10:23.121
Bishop:
We tried to make contact,

10:23.123 --> 10:24.723
but base communications
are still down.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.093
Can you find out
when he's coming back?

10:29.763 --> 10:32.330
We're going to do our best.

10:32.332 --> 10:35.133
(Horns honking,
brakes squeaking)

10:35.135 --> 10:38.670
Fornell: So, where is this
contact of DiNozzo's?

10:38.672 --> 10:40.138
What's with you?

10:40.140 --> 10:42.073
Haven't eaten since DC.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.876
The inflight meal was inedible.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.344
They didn't serve
you tea and biscuits?

10:46.346 --> 10:49.080
No, I wasn't
in first class.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.882
It was credit card points.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.756
It's a fine day
for a stroll, is it not?

10:58.692 --> 10:59.791
You from MI6?

11:01.728 --> 11:05.697
It's a fine day
for a stroll, is it not?

11:05.699 --> 11:08.366
Indeed it is,
but I prefer to saunter.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.907
Gentlemen...

11:16.877 --> 11:18.109
<i> ...semper occultus.</i>

11:27.287 --> 11:28.720
What the hell was that?

11:28.722 --> 11:30.922
Agent DiNozzo
left instructions

11:30.924 --> 11:33.258
for a coded exchange.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.459
You're kidding me.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.730
God save the queen.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.465
What is it?

11:40.467 --> 11:41.766
It's Jessica terdei's

11:41.768 --> 11:44.803
MI6 application
request from 1984.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.471
DiNozzo's highlighted her

11:46.473 --> 11:48.773
"in case of emergency" contact.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.041
It's an uncle.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.476
Hugo Radcliffe,

11:51.478 --> 11:53.411
from warwickshire.

11:53.413 --> 11:57.148
There was no mention of any
family in her personnel file.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.850
Well, then agent DiNozzo

11:58.852 --> 12:01.119
has left us one hell
of a breadcrumb.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.823
Gibbs, I want

12:04.825 --> 12:06.725
to celebrate the
fact that you are

12:06.727 --> 12:08.326
a builder and...

12:08.328 --> 12:09.961
A catcher of bad guys,

12:09.963 --> 12:11.863
and a man of

12:11.865 --> 12:13.465
gleaming silver hair.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.200
Abbs, what are you doing?

12:15.202 --> 12:17.202
People said
such nice things

12:17.204 --> 12:18.336
about tom morrow
this morning,

12:18.338 --> 12:19.938
and it just made me realize

12:19.940 --> 12:21.773
that we shouldn't wait
until people are gone

12:21.775 --> 12:23.775
to celebrate them,
so I'm starting a movement:

12:23.777 --> 12:26.010
#livingrocks.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.779
Although I'm a
little bit afraid

12:27.781 --> 12:29.748
that people might think
I'm talking about an actual

12:29.750 --> 12:31.783
rock that's alive, although

12:31.785 --> 12:32.984
that would be
really exciting, too.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.285
Abby, I think the fact

12:34.287 --> 12:35.854
that you're celebrating
people is awesome.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.890
McGee, I want to
celebrate that you

12:38.892 --> 12:40.792
can light up a room

12:40.794 --> 12:42.761
as fast as you can ping a phone.

12:42.763 --> 12:43.762
Well, thanks.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.363
#livingrocks.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.931
#gettothepoint.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.500
Oh, my god...

12:48.502 --> 12:51.936
Gibbs, you just
used the word hashtag

12:51.938 --> 12:53.772
in a sentence.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.441
Getting to the point.

12:56.443 --> 13:01.312
So... this is the 38 that
Henry used to shoot Mickey Doyle

13:01.314 --> 13:02.847
and this is the bullet.

13:02.849 --> 13:03.848
What'd they give us?

13:03.850 --> 13:05.183
Well, the fingerprints

13:05.185 --> 13:07.385
and the ballistics
match Henry's story,

13:07.387 --> 13:09.454
but the real conversation
piece is not this gun.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.422
It's where the
gun was kept.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.993
The Marshall family safe.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.461
It's equipped

13:16.463 --> 13:19.330
with a memory drive
that logs a time stamp

13:19.332 --> 13:20.865
whenever the safe
is accessed.

13:20.867 --> 13:21.933
McGee:
Henry said that

13:21.935 --> 13:23.168
he ran to go get the gun

13:23.170 --> 13:24.335
when he heard
Doyle breaking in.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.503
Yeah, but according

13:25.505 --> 13:27.238
to the log, the last time

13:27.240 --> 13:31.342
the safe was accessed
was two days ago.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.211
Got the weapon out
before the break-in.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.379
Why would he do that?

13:34.381 --> 13:36.414
Why would he
lie about it?

13:39.486 --> 13:40.952
Boss.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.987
You talked to Henry before,

13:42.989 --> 13:45.123
and you want to be the one
to talk to him now.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.392
Well, there's more to it
than that, but...

13:47.394 --> 13:50.428
How old were you when your
father was in the military?

13:51.998 --> 13:53.565
He was out
before I was born.

13:53.567 --> 13:56.367
Right, and with your family,
you were the one deploying.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.436
Meaning what, McGee?

13:58.438 --> 14:02.006
Boss, serving on the home front,
it's a very different thing.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.311
Well, you would know.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.580
I think I got a really good shot
at getting through to Henry.

14:08.582 --> 14:11.115
Okay.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.986
Henry:
<i> So, your dad was an admiral?</i>

14:14.988 --> 14:16.955
Yeah, four-star.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.591
Did he deploy a lot?

14:19.593 --> 14:22.026
Mm, all the time.

14:22.028 --> 14:27.465
I remember this one day,
before he was gonna leave,

14:27.467 --> 14:30.535
I accidentally fell out
of a tree, broke my arm.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.137
I was, uh, I was
six years old and, uh,

14:33.139 --> 14:35.306
I remember my arm
was killing me, but, uh,

14:35.308 --> 14:38.576
I was smiling all
the way to the E.R.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.212
'Cause you didn't think
he'd leave if you were hurt.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.881
Exactly.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.284
Did he?

14:46.286 --> 14:48.186
Dumb question.

14:49.956 --> 14:54.525
You know, I remember every
time my dad would leave,

14:54.527 --> 14:58.129
I'd get all these feelings,
you know, like...

14:58.131 --> 15:02.066
You're angry and
you're sad, and...

15:02.068 --> 15:04.669
And you're afraid, you know,
and you're proud...

15:04.671 --> 15:07.071
I understand it.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.007
I'll tell you what,
it's easier...

15:09.009 --> 15:11.943
If you don't keep
all that to yourself.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.479
(Sighs)

15:14.481 --> 15:17.015
I know why you brought me here.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.486
I lied because I thought
i could handle it on my own.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.688
Handle what?

15:23.690 --> 15:26.357
A couple nights ago,
i was out late.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.427
I was walking by this alley
when I heard yelling,

15:29.429 --> 15:32.697
and I saw these two guys.

15:32.699 --> 15:36.601
One of them...

15:36.603 --> 15:39.270
One of them stabbed
the other one.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.041
Did you see who did it?

15:44.210 --> 15:46.244
It was the picture
you showed me.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.512
Mickey Doyle.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.047
After he left,

15:49.049 --> 15:51.049
I went over to the guy
on the ground.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.720
He was dead.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.990
I heard Doyle
coming back, so...

15:58.992 --> 16:02.593
I ran home and I got my
dad's gun from the safe.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.263
And you've been holding
on to it since then, right?

16:05.265 --> 16:08.533
He knows what I saw.

16:08.535 --> 16:12.070
He's gonna kill me, isn't he?

16:22.115 --> 16:23.548
Hey, what do you got?

16:23.550 --> 16:24.983
Around midnight,

16:24.985 --> 16:26.250
last Sunday,

16:26.252 --> 16:27.385
Henry Marshall was walking

16:27.387 --> 16:28.653
down on dresner Avenue,

16:28.655 --> 16:30.321
passed an alley, and saw

16:30.323 --> 16:33.091
Mickey Doyle stab and kill
an unidentified man.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.726
Henry was the only witness,

16:34.728 --> 16:36.327
and the break-in
was to silence him.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.062
How did Doyle track him down?

16:38.064 --> 16:40.064
Well, we're not
exactly sure yet, but

16:40.066 --> 16:42.066
Henry's pretty sure
he wasn't followed.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.067
What about the body?

16:43.069 --> 16:44.402
County morgue says that

16:44.404 --> 16:46.237
they have two stabbing
victims that match

16:46.239 --> 16:48.439
the description Henry gave,
but neither are from an alley,

16:48.441 --> 16:50.475
so it's possible
the body was moved.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.310
That's good work, Tim.

16:52.312 --> 16:55.380
Loop in Harpers ferry pd.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.714
Gibbs, I was doing
background on Anne Marshall,

16:56.716 --> 16:58.483
and the situation she's
in is completely unfair.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.251
What situation?

17:00.253 --> 17:02.553
The only reason she can't
practice law here is because

17:02.555 --> 17:05.189
West Virginia's bar doesn't
reciprocate with California.

17:05.191 --> 17:08.059
So, her 15 years of
experience went to nothing

17:08.061 --> 17:10.028
just because she
crossed state lines.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.663
Bishop, focus on the case.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.165
It's not right, Gibbs.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.466
When troops fight
for their country,

17:15.468 --> 17:17.168
their families do, too.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.203
Anne Marshall, all the
military spouses out there,

17:19.205 --> 17:21.105
who-who fights for them?

17:21.107 --> 17:23.174
We do.

17:23.176 --> 17:27.745
Good, because I want to
reach out to joining forces.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.481
It's an initiative that
supports military veterans

17:30.483 --> 17:31.682
and their families and...

17:31.684 --> 17:33.084
I-i know what it is.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.118
I'm looking into it.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.353
I already made the call.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.822
Oh... thank you.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.323
You want to thank me?

17:39.325 --> 17:40.358
(Elevator chimes)

17:40.360 --> 17:41.793
Find Mickey Doyle!

17:45.231 --> 17:46.697
Anne:<i> I knew Henry</i>
<i> was acting strange,</i>

17:46.699 --> 17:49.167
but I just assumed
it was because

17:49.169 --> 17:51.169
his father's deployment
had been extended.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.806
I never could've
imagined this.

17:54.808 --> 17:58.776
Henry's situation is why
i wanted to talk to you alone.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.179
What about it?

18:01.181 --> 18:04.382
The homicide he witnessed,
the break-in at your house,

18:04.384 --> 18:06.150
they're connected.

18:06.152 --> 18:08.286
We need to put
your family

18:08.288 --> 18:10.221
into protective custody.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.491
Is my son's life in danger?

18:16.129 --> 18:17.862
Oh, my god.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.698
We need Henry's help
with the investigation.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.867
My son's been through
enough, agent Gibbs.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.603
What he needs right now
is to feel safe.

18:25.605 --> 18:29.474
The only way that happens
is we find Mickey Doyle.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.714
You're thinking he witnessed one
of our stabbings from last week?

18:36.716 --> 18:39.317
We're looking into it now.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.452
Lead investigator is
the same on both cases.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.588
Name is detective Swanson.
I briefed him.

18:43.590 --> 18:44.722
He'll take good care of you.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.691
All right, thank you.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.197
Swanson.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.365
Gibbs.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.666
Special agent McGee.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.667
Hi.
Hey.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.169
This is Henry.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.438
Good to meet you.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.141
Why don't you have a seat?

19:03.143 --> 19:04.675
Can I get you a water?

19:04.677 --> 19:05.810
Or a soda, or...?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.245
No, thank you.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.779
Swanson: Just want to get
this over with, huh?

19:08.781 --> 19:11.516
Yes, sir.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.520
These...

19:15.522 --> 19:17.221
Are my two victims.

19:17.223 --> 19:19.323
Do you recognize
either of them?

19:21.294 --> 19:22.760
I-i don't know.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.530
I'm... I'm not sure.

19:27.667 --> 19:31.202
Now, Henry, before you look
at these crime scene photos,

19:31.204 --> 19:33.237
you should know that
sometimes people look

19:33.239 --> 19:34.839
a little different
when they're dead, and...

19:34.841 --> 19:37.575
You don't have to look at them
if you don't want to.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.880
No, I... I want to.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.895
It's not him.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.964
Are you sure?

19:59.966 --> 20:01.799
I'm sure.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.802
Neither one's the guy I saw.

20:10.443 --> 20:14.512
(Dog barking)

20:14.514 --> 20:16.480
That doesn't bode well
for the health codes here.

20:16.482 --> 20:19.217
Traditional pub,
with charming locals.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.785
Doesn't get any
better than this.
Yeah.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.386
Vance:
Excuse me?

20:22.388 --> 20:24.288
All due respect,
you sound like a suit.

20:24.290 --> 20:25.656
We are suits.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.924
You have a better idea,
agent fornell?

20:26.926 --> 20:28.259
It's a local place.

20:28.261 --> 20:29.727
Speak like a local, you know?

20:29.729 --> 20:30.962
May I?

20:32.765 --> 20:34.365
Cheers, mate!

20:38.905 --> 20:40.304
Well, that was natural.

20:40.306 --> 20:41.806
Worked, didn't it?

20:41.808 --> 20:43.808
What can I get for you fellas?

20:43.810 --> 20:45.443
Hugo Radcliffe?

20:45.445 --> 20:46.777
Yeah.

20:46.779 --> 20:47.945
We're looking for your niece,

20:47.947 --> 20:49.280
Jessica terdei.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.314
It's imperative that

20:50.316 --> 20:51.449
we speak with her.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.550
Who's asking?

20:52.552 --> 20:53.651
NCIS.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.019
FBI.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.855
W.C. Ten Gauge.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.858
Now get the 'ell
off my property.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.860
Mr. Radcliffe...

21:02.862 --> 21:04.862
We're the good guys.

21:04.863 --> 21:06.863
Vance: And we don't have
time for this.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.966
A man that your niece put
in prison has escaped.

21:08.968 --> 21:12.003
He's targeting people and
she might know who's next.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.871
It could even be her.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.573
Fornell: See?

21:15.575 --> 21:17.675
The good guys.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.045
Let's take a drive.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.485
Hey. You okay?

21:27.487 --> 21:30.288
Oh, yeah, no, I was just
thinking about this

21:30.290 --> 21:32.857
movement that I'm spearheading
about celebrating people.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.325
Oh, yeah.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.893
How's that going?
Well, you know,

21:35.895 --> 21:37.428
I'm starting pretty
close to home,

21:37.430 --> 21:38.763
but you never know
with these things.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.865
It could spread like wildfire.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.633
Bishop, I want
to celebrate

21:42.635 --> 21:43.701
that you can

21:43.703 --> 21:45.036
eat like Paul bunyan,

21:45.038 --> 21:47.772
and your heart is
as big as his, too.

21:47.774 --> 21:51.309
Abby, I am touched.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.511
#livingrocks!

21:53.513 --> 21:54.645
Tell your friends.

21:54.647 --> 21:55.780
Hey, will you help
me with this?

21:55.782 --> 21:57.448
Yep.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.051
Here, hold this.

22:00.053 --> 22:03.387
So Henry said that
Doyle stabbed the guy

22:03.389 --> 22:05.790
just in front of this door.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.992
Hmm. Bluestar is good
on this surface?

22:07.994 --> 22:09.794
If there is a
trace of blood,

22:09.796 --> 22:13.064
this is going to light up
like a Christmas tree.

22:13.066 --> 22:16.567
There are 237 days
until Christmas,

22:16.569 --> 22:18.002
by the way.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.937
(Groans quietly)

22:19.939 --> 22:23.474
Uh... not seeing anything.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.876
Santa claus is definitely
not in town.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.714
If the stabbing happened here,
like Henry said,

22:29.716 --> 22:32.016
there'd be some trace of it.

22:34.721 --> 22:35.953
McGee:
<i> Can't sleep?</i>

22:37.724 --> 22:39.990
I have this dream.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.426
It wakes me up.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.795
It's about my dad
saying good-bye.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.068
Hey.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.737
I understand, okay?

22:52.739 --> 22:53.838
I know the feeling.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.606
You're worried
it's the last time

22:55.608 --> 22:56.941
you're going to see him.

22:56.943 --> 23:00.945
I'm not lying about what I saw,
agent McGee.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.581
Do you believe me?

23:03.583 --> 23:04.882
Absolutely.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.050
I believe you 100%, okay?

23:09.522 --> 23:12.423
What's wrong?

23:12.425 --> 23:14.625
TV reporter:
A body pulled from the anacostia
river has been identified

23:14.627 --> 23:16.861
as Wayne woods,
a convicted drug dealer,

23:16.863 --> 23:18.596
currently on probation...

23:18.598 --> 23:19.764
That's him.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.599
...with intent to sell
meth amphetamine.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.701
That's the guy I saw get killed.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.811
The body pulled
from the anacostia river

23:33.813 --> 23:35.513
was identified as Wayne woods.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.748
Local m.E.'S report
matches Henry's story.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.417
What do we know about woods?

23:39.419 --> 23:40.785
The streets are safer
with him gone.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.420
Thank you.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.854
Now, that's just my
professional opinion,

23:43.856 --> 23:45.623
but I'll let you decide,

23:45.625 --> 23:47.691
after reading his
greatest hits.

23:47.693 --> 23:48.859
You knew woods.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.161
Oh, yeah.

23:50.163 --> 23:51.896
He's partly responsible
for the escalating

23:51.898 --> 23:53.597
drug problem
in Jefferson county.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.132
Tried to bust
him for months,

23:55.134 --> 23:57.501
but I could never
get a charge to stick.

23:57.503 --> 23:59.503
He must have friends
in the right places.

23:59.505 --> 24:00.971
And his share of enemies.

24:00.973 --> 24:04.442
Woods most likely was taken out
by a rival.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.043
Poetic justice,
when you think about it.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.645
A rival?

24:07.647 --> 24:09.580
Like Mickey Doyle?

24:09.582 --> 24:10.981
That's a strong possibility.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.716
Woods and Doyle were both
criminal Alpha dogs

24:15.621 --> 24:16.821
trying to mark
the same territory.

24:16.822 --> 24:18.022
We'd like woods's body
transferred back to NCIS.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.523
I already made a call.

24:19.525 --> 24:20.724
You should be getting it

24:20.726 --> 24:22.026
within the hour.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.495
Like I said,
we're on the same side.

24:24.497 --> 24:26.564
<i> (Car engine)</i>

24:34.173 --> 24:36.173
Radcliffe:
Here we are.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.142
And in record time,
i might add.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.510
Fornell:
That was the most

24:39.512 --> 24:41.078
terrifying car ride
of my life,

24:41.080 --> 24:42.480
and I've driven with Emily.

24:42.482 --> 24:43.714
Watch out. (Grunts)

24:43.716 --> 24:45.983
Vance: I could have sworn
we lost a wheel.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.685
Ah, we hit a few bumps.

24:47.687 --> 24:48.719
Quit your moanin'.

24:48.721 --> 24:49.987
(Groans)

24:49.989 --> 24:51.555
Radcliffe:
Come on.

24:51.557 --> 24:52.890
This way.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.692
(Sheep bleating)
Vance: So why is your niece

24:54.694 --> 24:55.893
hiding off the grid?

24:55.895 --> 24:57.661
Who says she's hiding?

24:57.663 --> 24:59.997
Secluded cottage
in the middle of nowhere.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.066
Certainly seems like she's
running from something.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.634
(Laughs)

25:03.636 --> 25:05.970
You don't know Jessie.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.671
That's far enough.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.940
Quite the family resemblance.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.543
These aren't friends of yours,
are they uncle?

25:12.545 --> 25:15.079
These feds think
you're in danger.

25:15.081 --> 25:17.214
Doesn't look that way
from my point of view.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.649
State your business.

25:18.651 --> 25:20.518
Jacob Scott.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.586
He's escaped from prison.

25:22.588 --> 25:23.787
Then what the hell
are you doing here?

25:23.789 --> 25:25.022
The person you need to speak to

25:25.024 --> 25:27.024
is back in the states--
tom morrow.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.926
Morrow's dead.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.032
All right, then.
Come on in.

25:35.034 --> 25:38.002
I'll put the kettle on.
Come on.

25:45.177 --> 25:47.711
Henry's upstairs
with his sister.

25:48.681 --> 25:49.780
He was annoyed with me

25:49.782 --> 25:51.582
watching over him
like a hawk.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.651
Something he better get used to.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.790
Everything okay?

25:59.792 --> 26:01.559
I can't stop thinking
about how close Henry

26:01.561 --> 26:04.128
came to being a body
pulled from the river.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.829
That's not going to happen.

26:05.831 --> 26:08.732
Don't placate me, agent Gibbs.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.936
I've done my homework
on Mickey Doyle.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.139
You hacked NCIS files?

26:15.141 --> 26:16.807
No.

26:16.809 --> 26:19.677
I called in a favor with
a friend at the courthouse.

26:19.679 --> 26:22.212
I got access to
Doyle's record.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.582
I prosecuted
criminals like him.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.584
I know how they operate.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.653
They get away with murder by
not leaving any loose ends.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.890
My son is a loose end.

26:32.892 --> 26:36.160
Hey... he is safe here.

26:36.162 --> 26:37.861
You all are.

26:37.863 --> 26:39.863
If Doyle tracked
down Henry before,

26:39.865 --> 26:43.167
what makes you think
he can't do it again?

26:43.169 --> 26:45.369
My family's not safe.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.605
Anywhere.

26:50.910 --> 26:53.043
Hey, ducky.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.179
Detective Swanson came through
with the body, huh?

26:55.181 --> 26:56.347
Indeed.

26:56.349 --> 26:58.315
Meet Wayne woods.

26:58.317 --> 26:59.917
Although he was
pulled from the river,

26:59.919 --> 27:02.786
his lungs were
devoid of water.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.955
Mm. He was already dead
when his body was dumped.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.657
Precisely.

27:06.659 --> 27:10.060
His penultimate chapter
ended with quite a struggle.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.796
Contusions,
multiple stab wounds...

27:12.798 --> 27:14.732
One of which
pierced his aorta.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.101
That was the manner of death.

27:17.103 --> 27:21.372
Here, take a look
at the entry wounds.

27:21.374 --> 27:23.340
Ah, jagged.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.809
Yes, but with a pattern.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.078
The murder weapon had a...

27:28.080 --> 27:30.681
Distinctly serrated blade.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.283
Ducky!

27:33.285 --> 27:35.085
I want to celebrate

27:35.087 --> 27:38.355
the fact that you are a friend
with a scalpel.

27:38.357 --> 27:41.892
And you inspire
dead people to talk,

27:41.894 --> 27:44.294
and alive people to listen.

27:44.296 --> 27:46.797
Abby, what a lovely thing
to say.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.666
#livingrocks!

27:48.668 --> 27:52.336
Anthropomorphic stones,
how curious.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.338
Abby, any thoughts
on the murder weapon?

27:54.340 --> 27:56.940
Uh, yeah,
like one big thought.

27:56.942 --> 27:59.143
So based on the cutting pattern,

27:59.145 --> 28:00.678
it was a serrated combat knife,

28:00.680 --> 28:02.713
with a five-inch blade,
and that's not all.

28:02.715 --> 28:05.816
I ran the DNA from underneath
woods' fingernails.

28:05.818 --> 28:06.984
I got a match.

28:06.986 --> 28:08.852
(Abby typing)

28:10.122 --> 28:12.056
Mickey Doyle.
Abby: Yep.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.158
So... Henry was
telling the truth.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.060
He saw Doyle kill woods.

28:16.062 --> 28:19.830
So why wasn't there any evidence
at the crime scene?

28:19.832 --> 28:22.299
Maybe Doyle cleaned up his mess.

28:22.301 --> 28:25.135
We didn't find a single
trace of blood.

28:25.137 --> 28:27.304
I mean, if this guy
cleaned up after himself,

28:27.306 --> 28:29.907
he must be, like,
really good at it.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.175
Bishop.

28:31.177 --> 28:33.844
Hey, we had a bolo hit
on Doyle's rv.

28:33.846 --> 28:34.978
On my way.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.288
(Knocking on door)

28:44.290 --> 28:45.989
NCIS!

28:55.201 --> 28:56.500
Suspect's down.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.169
At least we know Mickey Doyle

28:59.171 --> 29:00.437
won't be bothering
Henry anymore.

29:00.439 --> 29:01.872
Yeah, well,
whoever killed Doyle

29:01.874 --> 29:03.140
had a reason.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.042
Henry could still be a target.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.744
Gibbs....

29:06.746 --> 29:08.846
Looks like the knife
Abby described.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.147
(Phone ringing)
Bag it, bishop.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.049
Bag all of it.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.084
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.118
(Agent speaking
indistinctly over phone)

29:14.120 --> 29:15.452
What?!

29:15.454 --> 29:16.687
When?

29:16.688 --> 29:17.921
(Agent speaking indistinctly
over phone)

29:17.923 --> 29:20.457
Well, you stay where you are.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.760
Agent on duty can't find Henry.

29:22.762 --> 29:23.761
Said he's gone.

29:23.763 --> 29:26.330
Bishop, you stay here.
McGee...

29:26.332 --> 29:28.165
I think I know where
he might be headed, boss.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.814
Henry.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.015
(Sighs with relief)

29:46.552 --> 29:47.951
How'd you know I was here?

29:47.953 --> 29:49.353
Well, if I were
looking for Doyle,

29:49.355 --> 29:52.856
I'd go to the first place
i saw him, too.

29:52.858 --> 29:54.958
He's not going to stop
until he finds me.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.226
I just...

29:56.228 --> 29:57.361
He's not going to find you.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.129
Yes, he will.
Henry...

29:59.131 --> 30:01.498
He's not going to find you--
Doyle's dead.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.966
Look, I need you to
come with me

30:02.968 --> 30:05.335
back to Gibbs' house, okay?

30:08.007 --> 30:10.207
You think someone else
is after me now.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.510
(Voice breaking):
What am I going to do?

30:13.512 --> 30:15.212
Come with me
back to the house, okay?

30:15.214 --> 30:16.380
Your mom is worried sick, man.

30:16.382 --> 30:17.881
No.

30:17.883 --> 30:20.117
I promised my dad
I'd protect them.

30:20.119 --> 30:22.085
It's my job to keep them safe.

30:22.087 --> 30:23.420
I understand that, okay?

30:23.422 --> 30:26.256
But it's my job
to keep you safe, too.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.959
So how about
you help me do my job,

30:28.961 --> 30:32.462
and I'll help you do yours.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.271
I might have been thrown
by the accent,

30:41.273 --> 30:44.274
but you didn't seem surprised
by morrow's death.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.243
I supposed I always
had a feeling

30:46.245 --> 30:48.912
that operation would come back
to bite us in the ass.

30:48.914 --> 30:51.348
Operation Juniper strike.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.484
There's more to what happened
than what's in the case files.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.987
Our objective
was to catch nika razin,

30:56.989 --> 30:59.256
the Russian buyer Scott
was selling secrets to.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.158
Who we now know
was also his wife.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.026
I figured as much.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.261
Vance:
So what exactly happened

31:04.263 --> 31:05.896
during the raid?

31:05.898 --> 31:08.332
We used one
of Scott's cell phones

31:08.334 --> 31:09.633
and lured razin

31:09.635 --> 31:11.568
out of the Russian embassy
in Istanbul.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.238
But the op went south,
almost immediately.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.207
An identified sniper
took her out.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.543
The Russians would rather
have her dead than captured.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.578
That was our assumption, too.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.513
But since the target
was neutralized,

31:23.515 --> 31:25.482
the mission
was deemed a success.

31:25.484 --> 31:30.153
And the conveniently-timed
sniper hit was just written off.

31:30.155 --> 31:31.655
Clearly someone
on the inside

31:31.657 --> 31:33.657
leaked the details of the op.

31:33.659 --> 31:37.027
Which is exactly why I conducted
an off-the-book investigation.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.129
All my operatives
were cleared.

31:39.131 --> 31:43.500
The leak did not come from MI6,
it came from NCIS.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.204
And why didn't you relay
this information to morrow?

31:47.206 --> 31:48.405
I did.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.173
Morrow's the one who buried it.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.945
(Sheep bleating
in distance)

31:54.947 --> 31:55.946
Gentlemen...

31:55.948 --> 31:57.681
(Sheep bleating)

31:57.683 --> 31:59.416
We've got company.

32:00.219 --> 32:01.351
We missing something?

32:01.353 --> 32:03.020
Radcliffe:
The herd.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.955
They're spooked.
Sheep?

32:04.957 --> 32:06.089
That's your early
warning system?

32:07.693 --> 32:09.559
Get down!
Fornell: Leon! Cover!

32:19.705 --> 32:21.538
Now!

32:26.145 --> 32:28.011
(Engine revs, tires squeal)

32:28.013 --> 32:29.313
I think they're gone.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.225
You're telling me Jacob Scott
is back in the uk?

32:42.227 --> 32:43.226
Can't say for certain.

32:43.228 --> 32:44.628
We were too busy dodging bullets

32:44.630 --> 32:46.363
to get a look
at the shooter's face.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.365
Someone must've
tailed us from London.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.500
Wait, who knew you
were there, Leon?

32:50.502 --> 32:54.438
Handful of people
from NCIS, MI6, FBI.

32:54.440 --> 32:57.040
We got a mole, Gibbs.

32:57.042 --> 32:59.042
Somebody doesn't want us
poking around this case.

32:59.044 --> 33:01.645
The list of people
to trust just got shorter.

33:01.647 --> 33:04.314
Okay, I'll get DiNozzo
back from Moscow asap.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.382
What about terdei?

33:05.384 --> 33:06.516
She's a target.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.585
We got to get her
someplace safe.

33:08.587 --> 33:10.053
We're on the next flight out.

33:10.055 --> 33:12.589
MI6 will follow up
on local leads.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.391
Watch your six, director.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.293
Got it.

33:16.295 --> 33:17.561
Gibbs.

33:17.563 --> 33:19.596
Hi, Andy.
Thanks for meeting me.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.431
First time I've seen you
without a coffee in your hand.

33:21.433 --> 33:22.666
I just had one.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.668
Although, I hear
the best coffee in DC

33:24.670 --> 33:26.269
is from the Navy mess.

33:26.271 --> 33:28.005
Oh, working at the
white house has its perks.

33:28.007 --> 33:29.172
(Chuckles)

33:29.174 --> 33:30.407
What do you got for me?

33:30.409 --> 33:32.042
Walk with me.

33:32.044 --> 33:34.077
After your call, I followed
up on Anne Marshall.

33:34.079 --> 33:36.346
Yeah, a talented lawyer
like that should be

33:36.348 --> 33:38.015
practicing,
not starting over.

33:38.017 --> 33:40.083
I agree, but transferring
professional certifications

33:40.085 --> 33:42.185
across state lines is
a complicated process.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.787
That kind of legislation
takes time, Gibbs.

33:43.789 --> 33:47.791
How long does it take
to do what's right?

33:47.793 --> 33:50.460
You and I both know
situations like these

33:50.462 --> 33:52.129
affect military families
all the time,

33:52.131 --> 33:54.031
but joining forces
is making headway.

33:54.033 --> 33:56.333
What about Anne Marshall?

33:56.335 --> 33:59.569
I'll route her case up
my chain of command.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.739
Look, I have to get to a
meeting, but I'll be in touch.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.408
Bishop:
<i> This stuff from</i>

34:04.410 --> 34:06.376
the rv give you anything?
Oh, yeah.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.646
Proof that Doyle and
his living situation are,

34:09.648 --> 34:11.148
in fact, disgusting.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.182
Tell me about it.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.517
Oh, I will.

34:13.519 --> 34:15.085
Exhibit a.

34:15.087 --> 34:17.320
The knife that was
confiscated from the camper.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.122
It's got Doyle's
fingerprints on the handle

34:19.124 --> 34:21.091
and woods' blood
on the blade.

34:21.093 --> 34:22.259
Definitely the
murder weapon.

34:22.261 --> 34:23.693
Definitely dirty.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.695
Why would he be so
careful to clean the alley,

34:25.697 --> 34:28.198
then not even bother to
wash off the murder weapon?

34:28.200 --> 34:31.835
That's exactly what I just
asked major mass spec.

34:31.837 --> 34:34.604
So, I tested some
swabs from the alley.

34:34.606 --> 34:37.441
It was scrubbed with
a professional grade cleaner

34:37.443 --> 34:39.743
and then covered over
with alley grime.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.479
Whoever did it knew how
to beat the bluestar.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.381
Could be the same person
that killed Doyle,

34:44.383 --> 34:46.516
trying to tie up loose ends.

34:46.518 --> 34:49.486
Abby, I celebrate

34:49.488 --> 34:51.455
that you can take a tiny clue

34:51.457 --> 34:54.324
and turn it
into a game changer.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.860
And you give
the best hugs ever.

34:56.862 --> 34:59.129
#livingrocks.

35:00.232 --> 35:01.231
(Chuckles)

35:01.233 --> 35:02.365
It's spreading
like wildfire.

35:02.367 --> 35:03.366
Mm-hmm.

35:03.368 --> 35:04.768
Hey, I got something.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.203
Go, McGee, go.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.472
The day after woods'
murder, traffic cams

35:08.474 --> 35:09.773
near the alley were accessed.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.541
Doyle I.D.'D Henry
from the footage?

35:11.543 --> 35:14.277
No, that's how they
tracked Henry back to his house.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.113
Doyle did the dirty work,
but he wasn't the one

35:16.115 --> 35:17.147
who accessed the cameras.

35:17.149 --> 35:19.549
Then who did?

35:19.551 --> 35:21.618
Harpers ferry police.

35:26.658 --> 35:27.724
Swanson.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.494
Got a lead you might
be interested in.

35:30.496 --> 35:31.661
Yeah, Doyle is dead, I heard.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.130
Bishop:
You hear who shot him?

35:33.132 --> 35:34.531
Dirty cop.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.299
On the take with the
drug gangs in the county,

35:36.301 --> 35:38.452
kept Doyle ahead
of the law.

35:38.453 --> 35:40.604
Well, you better start
thinking real hard

35:40.606 --> 35:41.838
before you start accusing.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.306
Not accusing.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.609
Arresting.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.179
What's this?

35:49.181 --> 35:51.748
Traffic cams were accessed
from your terminal.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.717
You told Doyle
where Henry lived,

35:53.719 --> 35:56.153
and then you killed him
to cover your tracks.

35:56.155 --> 35:57.320
What are you talking about?

35:57.322 --> 35:58.421
I didn't kill anyone.

35:58.423 --> 35:59.456
She's right.

35:59.458 --> 36:00.757
Cameras don't
prove anything.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.259
No, but the
unregistered drop gun

36:02.261 --> 36:03.293
we found at her
apartment does.

36:03.295 --> 36:04.561
Oh, yeah, there's that.

36:04.563 --> 36:05.562
Mm-hmm.

36:05.564 --> 36:06.630
Turn around.

36:07.432 --> 36:08.865
Kristin?

36:08.867 --> 36:10.634
I want a lawyer.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.436
(Phone rings)

36:15.440 --> 36:17.908
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

36:17.910 --> 36:20.710
Yeah, Andy.

36:20.712 --> 36:23.346
With who?

36:23.348 --> 36:26.483
Yeah, yeah, we'll be there.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.355
Anne:
<i> I am so honored</i>

36:32.357 --> 36:34.224
to have been a part of this.

36:34.226 --> 36:36.693
I still can't
believe I'm here.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.930
Listening to everyone's stories,

36:39.932 --> 36:42.265
it made me feel
like I'm not alone.

36:42.267 --> 36:44.534
Because you're not alone, Anne.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.337
One of the reasons we hold
these round tables is to stay

36:47.339 --> 36:49.372
connected to our
military families.

36:51.543 --> 36:52.842
Special agent Gibbs.

36:52.844 --> 36:55.345
I've been briefed on everything

36:55.347 --> 36:56.947
you've done for Anne's family,

36:56.949 --> 36:59.950
and from what I heard,
you've gone above and beyond.

36:59.952 --> 37:01.484
It's my job.

37:01.486 --> 37:03.553
Both NCIS and

37:03.555 --> 37:07.557
joining forces,
their support has been...

37:08.894 --> 37:10.627
I can't thank
you enough.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.495
Anne, we should be thanking you.

37:12.497 --> 37:15.999
I mean, we know the sacrifices
our military families are making

37:16.001 --> 37:17.901
and it doesn't go unnoticed.

37:17.903 --> 37:20.503
Nor do the sacrifices
of our veterans.

37:20.505 --> 37:22.505
Honor to serve, ma'am.

37:22.507 --> 37:26.343
Now, I understand that there's
somewhere else you need to be.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.378
Isn't that right,
special agent Gibbs?

37:28.380 --> 37:30.580
Absolutely.

37:35.721 --> 37:38.521
There you go.

37:38.523 --> 37:40.724
Just let that sit, let it dry

37:40.726 --> 37:42.926
repaint it and it'll be
like it never happened.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.462
Your dad teach you
how to do that?

37:45.464 --> 37:46.997
Yup.

37:46.999 --> 37:48.865
(Door opening)

37:50.802 --> 37:52.535
(Baby fusses)
Henry...

37:52.537 --> 37:54.404
What's wrong?

37:54.406 --> 37:57.674
The security threat
at your dad's base...

37:57.676 --> 37:58.842
It's over.

37:58.844 --> 38:01.478
So we get to talk to him?

38:03.882 --> 38:05.615
(Laughing):
Dad!

38:06.952 --> 38:08.351
Oh, I missed you, buddy.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.555
I love you guys.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.891
I love you so much.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.634
I won't be able to make it up
until tomorrow.

38:24.636 --> 38:26.970
Sorry, sweetheart, work stuff.

38:26.972 --> 38:30.040
Call me when you get this.

38:30.042 --> 38:31.841
A wife?

38:31.843 --> 38:33.343
Daughter.

38:33.345 --> 38:34.811
Emily.

38:34.813 --> 38:38.381
Smarter than I will ever be.

38:38.383 --> 38:40.417
She's in boarding
school up north.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.886
Then you live here alone?

38:42.888 --> 38:44.921
I do live alone, but not here.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.823
This is Gibbs's place.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.858
It's sort of a
floating safe house.

38:48.860 --> 38:49.893
Who's that?

38:49.895 --> 38:51.094
NCIS agent.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.729
Oh.

38:52.731 --> 38:55.332
He's on his way.
Should be here any minute.

38:55.334 --> 38:57.701
And this Gibbs, you,
uh, you trust him?

38:57.703 --> 38:59.903
Like no one else.

38:59.905 --> 39:03.506
Though, he did shoot
me in the ass once.

39:03.508 --> 39:04.708
(Laughs)

39:04.710 --> 39:06.743
Flesh wounds,
they heal easily enough.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.078
You sound like him.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.779
I'd offer you tea,
but he doesn't

39:09.781 --> 39:11.781
carry the stuff.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.886
Choices are...

39:16.888 --> 39:19.756
Water, beer, or bourbon.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.124
Whatever you're having.

39:27.666 --> 39:30.533
There's something I've
been meaning to tell you

39:30.535 --> 39:32.502
since we got back from england.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.404
What's that?

39:34.406 --> 39:36.873
I've come around
about your sheep.

39:38.477 --> 39:39.743
Is that right?

39:39.745 --> 39:41.411
They're very smart animals.

39:41.413 --> 39:43.713
Alert...

39:43.715 --> 39:45.815
Instinctive...

39:45.817 --> 39:48.518
I might be in
the market for one.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.388
