-Yeah.

to find.

probably fake, right?

08:38.909 --> 08:40.998
I'm not so sure.
Hollis's assistant confirmed

08:41.129 --> 08:43.392
he saw the treasure himself
before Hollis died.

08:43.479 --> 08:44.611
I didn't see that part on TV.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.482
He wanted
to keep it off the record.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.484
In case this thing gets crazy,

08:48.615 --> 08:50.051
he doesn't want anyone
to come looking for him.

08:50.181 --> 08:51.182
So this is real?

08:51.356 --> 08:53.794
There's $5 million out there

08:53.924 --> 08:55.360
just-just waiting to be found?

08:55.491 --> 08:57.667
-Looks like it.
-You know, uh,

08:57.798 --> 09:00.496
I bet if we compared notes,
we could probably

09:00.627 --> 09:02.063
figure out where
he buried that treasure.

09:02.237 --> 09:03.412
You're saying
you want to team up?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.370
Look for the treasure together?

09:05.501 --> 09:07.329
We'd be, uh,
we'd be doing a public service.

-Hmm.
-We find it so

09:08.852 --> 09:10.637
no one else has the chance
to get hurt.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.726
Yeah. And I mean,
clearly, it's my duty

09:12.856 --> 09:14.249
to keep the city informed.

09:14.379 --> 09:15.946
The sooner
that treasure is found,

09:16.077 --> 09:17.992
the safer the city will be.

09:18.079 --> 09:19.297
Everybody wins.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.244
He's been dead a week.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.811
Did we post uniforms
at his grave site?

You know, that's one

18:37.986 --> 18:39.596
maybe even a whole new house.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.511
I thought we could take
that honeymoon we never had,

18:41.642 --> 18:42.730
see the world.

18:42.860 --> 18:45.167
-Hmm.
-Hell...

18:45.298 --> 18:47.300
we could even decide to retire.

18:48.344 --> 18:49.563
Retire?

18:49.650 --> 18:51.652
I thought you loved your job.

18:51.826 --> 18:54.176
I do. But jobs like ours,
nobody does them forever.

18:54.307 --> 18:57.179
Eventually you hang it up
and go fishing.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.616
Not me. I mean,
you can have your fishing cabin

18:59.747 --> 19:02.663
or whatever at Lake Arrowhead.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.534
We can go up on the weekends.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.580
But I plan to be
out on those streets,

19:06.667 --> 19:08.756
until they force me off them.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.238
Somebody almost did.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.112
You nearly died last year,
Athena.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.680
I know you don't like
to talk about it, but it was

19:19.854 --> 19:21.551
a really close call.

19:21.682 --> 19:25.033
And most people would have
at least thought about quitting.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.469
Retiring.

19:26.643 --> 19:29.080
[sighs]:
I did. Elaine brought it up.

19:29.211 --> 19:32.475
She wanted me to seriously
consider it, so I did.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.260
And I decided not to.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.698
You never told me that.

19:37.785 --> 19:40.570
Well, I didn't see the point.
The decision was already made.

19:40.701 --> 19:43.138
I mean, what was there to say?
[chuckles]

19:43.269 --> 19:45.358
[Athena exhales]

19:45.532 --> 19:49.275
So, what was that
about that French toast?

19:53.148 --> 19:54.497
I see you've requested
the Willow Tree Suite.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.934
I think the two of you
will enjoy it.

19:57.108 --> 19:58.675
You and your, uh...?

19:58.806 --> 20:01.243
Oh, uh, boyfriend.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.637
-For now.
-Oh.

20:03.724 --> 20:05.639
Actually, you know,
just between us...

20:05.726 --> 20:07.815
I really think
this could be the weekend.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.817
Like theweekend, you know?

20:09.947 --> 20:12.167
I mean, just one last score.

20:12.298 --> 20:15.039
I... I mean,
your romantic setting

20:15.170 --> 20:17.781
is, uh...
I think he'll finally be ready.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.174
Love it.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.741
I'll send champagne up
to the room,

20:20.915 --> 20:22.917
-set the mood.
-[chuckles]

20:23.047 --> 20:26.616
-And where is the lucky fella?
-He's just outside. Yeah.

20:26.790 --> 20:29.880
Just, you know,
getting our stuff from the car.

20:31.099 --> 20:33.841
Uh, so, um...

20:34.755 --> 20:36.583
"River's Edge."

20:36.713 --> 20:37.975
You guys getting a lot
of business lately, or...?

20:38.149 --> 20:40.195
Actually, it's been,
uh, pretty good.

20:41.109 --> 20:42.719
Hey. Why you looking over there?

20:42.850 --> 20:44.504
Willow Tree Suite's that way.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.332
Wasn't over there, babe.
Trust me, I got a nose

20:46.506 --> 20:47.550
for this kind of thing.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.465
I do trust you.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.555
-Hey, babe?
-Yeah, babe?

20:52.642 --> 20:54.644
Look, you know
I love our adventures, right?

20:54.775 --> 20:55.906
Uh-huh.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.865
I was thinking...

20:57.995 --> 20:59.432
like, if we do find
this five mil,

20:59.562 --> 21:00.955
maybe we could call it quits
on the schemes.

21:01.085 --> 21:03.436
Check it out!
The ground here is super soft.

21:03.610 --> 21:07.091
-I bet somebody just dug it up.
-Yeah. Okay,

21:07.222 --> 21:08.310
the grass does not look dug-up.

21:08.441 --> 21:09.355
Baby, they're hiding treasure.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.531
It wouldn't look dug-up.

21:11.661 --> 21:13.837
-Okay.
-[chuckles]

21:13.968 --> 21:16.231

something down here.
-PERCY: Hey!

-Get away from there!
-[Richie sighs]

21:18.146 --> 21:19.626

I'll hold him off.

is likely full of methane.

some breathable air.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.784

of the woman down there?

-Keisha. She just fell in.
-Okay, gentlemen,

could still give way.

-River's Edge B&B?
