I can't wait to wake everyone up
and tell them the greatest news

01:30.047 --> 01:33.450
since we all got a year's supply of free
glitter gum with real glitter flavor!

01:35.185 --> 01:36.186
Hello.

01:36.219 --> 01:38.088
Cheeky, wake up!
Wake up!

01:51.634 --> 01:54.104
You what? They did?
No way!

01:54.137 --> 01:55.973
I gotta call Sprinkles.

01:56.006 --> 01:57.908
Hold on.
I'll group chat her in.

02:32.142 --> 02:34.211
I double-pinky
somersault swear!

02:34.244 --> 02:38.181
I heard from a friend, who heard
from a girl, who had a Shopkin pal,

02:38.215 --> 02:41.184
whose uncle worked at a store where
the assistant was a plumber,

02:41.218 --> 02:44.087
who overheard someone on their cell
phone say there's a new Shoppie

02:44.121 --> 02:46.356
and some new Shopkins
who've arrived in Shopville,

02:46.389 --> 02:49.326
and they starting a new cooking
club at the Cooking Academy!

02:53.663 --> 02:56.199
That would be so fun!
To the Cooking Academy!

02:57.267 --> 02:59.937

Who knew cooking needed so many
cooking things to cook with?

03:41.011 --> 03:43.146
What are these strange things?

03:43.180 --> 03:44.381
Some sort of hat?

03:44.414 --> 03:47.017
No, it's for cooking.

03:47.050 --> 03:49.352
And it doesn't go

03:49.386 --> 03:52.589

That says "Chef Club."
This must be the place!

04:12.675 --> 04:16.713
Or it could be a trap to make us think
it's the Chef Club, when it isn't.

04:16.745 --> 04:19.149
You think? OMG!

04:19.182 --> 04:21.651
Nah, I'm just messin' with ya.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.288
Whoa!

04:27.757 --> 04:30.327
Oh! Um, hi,
everybody?

04:30.360 --> 04:32.362
Hi!

04:35.698 --> 04:38.235
Uh, have you come
for the Chef Club?

04:38.268 --> 04:40.270
We sure have!

04:40.303 --> 04:43.473
Um, there sure are
a lot of you.

04:43.506 --> 04:46.443
I'm, uh, Peppa-Mint.
Welcome to Chef Club.

04:46.476 --> 04:48.078
Yay!

04:48.111 --> 04:51.181
And, this is-- is-- is--

04:51.214 --> 04:53.350
Now, Peppa, no need to be shy.

04:53.383 --> 04:55.352
But if you insist.

04:55.385 --> 04:57.187
I am Bessie Bowl.

04:57.220 --> 04:58.388
That is Buncho Bananas.

04:58.421 --> 05:01.058
La-la-la. I'm a top!

05:01.091 --> 05:02.659
And she is Nina Noodles.

05:02.692 --> 05:05.128
To eat or not to eat.

05:05.162 --> 05:07.230
That is the question.

05:07.264 --> 05:09.666
I'm Jessicake.
Nice to meet you all.

05:09.699 --> 05:13.136
Oh, um, uh,
you have pretty shoes!

05:14.271 --> 05:15.738
Thank you.

05:15.772 --> 05:17.740
And this is Donatina.

05:17.774 --> 05:20.477
Where? Oh, wait. That's me!

05:20.510 --> 05:23.680
Um, you have
a lovely... name?

05:23.713 --> 05:26.383
Thank you!
I've had it all my life.

05:26.416 --> 05:29.152

05:29.186 --> 05:31.054
Hi-hi-hi!

05:31.088 --> 05:33.423
Oh, aren't you...
enthusiastic?

05:35.492 --> 05:38.495
And this is Lippy Lips.

05:38.528 --> 05:41.231
Ah, what a lovely shade
of pink.

05:41.264 --> 05:43.100
So nice to meet you.

05:43.133 --> 05:45.202
Wait. Don't you
want to meet me?

05:45.235 --> 05:47.237
I'm wearing
a lovely shade of pink.

05:47.270 --> 05:49.239
Don't I get a compliment?

05:49.272 --> 05:53.076
Wow! That dress makes
you look like a zillion bucks!

05:53.110 --> 05:54.811
Really? You think so?

05:54.844 --> 05:59.382
It sure does, and it'd make you look like two
zillion bucks if you wore it right-side up.

06:14.864 --> 06:18.201
Was that a makeover,
or was that a makeover?

06:18.235 --> 06:19.836
That, was a makeover.

06:19.869 --> 06:21.438
Look out, world!

06:24.141 --> 06:27.277
Whoa! More pedal, Cheeky!

06:27.310 --> 06:29.446
Looking extra good, Lippy.

06:30.880 --> 06:34.351
Wait!
I look extra good too.

06:34.384 --> 06:36.853
Wow.
Now that I think about it,

06:36.886 --> 06:39.256
how come I never
get compliments?

06:39.289 --> 06:41.324
I have compliment needs.

06:41.358 --> 06:43.560
And that's Kooky Cookie.

06:43.593 --> 06:46.396
Well, um, I'm glad
to meet all of you.

06:46.429 --> 06:48.231
Glad to meet you!

Did I miss something?

09:28.658 --> 09:30.393
We're joining Chef Club.

09:30.427 --> 09:32.495
Okay!

09:32.529 --> 09:36.265
It sounds great, but how
do we get into Chef Club?

09:37.800 --> 09:41.037
To become a member, you will all
be asked to cook four recipes,

09:41.070 --> 09:45.041
from getting the ingredients, to cooking
the dish, to the final tasting.

09:45.074 --> 09:47.944
Um, we're not super chef-y,
though we want to be.

09:47.977 --> 09:49.746
Does that count?
We will help.

09:49.779 --> 09:52.315
Rome was not cooked in a day,
neither will you.

09:52.349 --> 09:54.451
I'm gonna cook up a storm,
then eat it!

09:54.484 --> 09:56.786
So, um, first,
if you don't mind,

09:56.819 --> 10:00.056
it would be really lovely
if you could please, maybe...

10:00.089 --> 10:02.559
get into groups,
you think?

10:04.994 --> 10:08.064
I want to be in their group!
Yes, groups are good.

10:08.097 --> 10:10.367
Remember,
"Too many chefs spoil the soup."

10:10.400 --> 10:13.370
- Ooh! Ooh! Are we making soup?
- I like soup!

10:13.403 --> 10:17.006
Okay, Donatina, Cheeky Chocolate and
Strawberry Tubs are in one group.

10:17.039 --> 10:18.441
Yay!

10:18.475 --> 10:20.677
Please-- Jessicake,
Apple Blossom, and...

10:20.710 --> 10:21.811
how about Miss Sprinkles?

10:21.844 --> 10:24.347
Yay! Whoo-hoo!

10:24.381 --> 10:26.516
Which leaves you three
as the final team.

10:28.084 --> 10:29.586
One for you.
One for you.

10:29.619 --> 10:31.421
One for you.
And one... for me?

10:31.454 --> 10:32.755
Yay me!

10:32.789 --> 10:35.392
The first recipe is-- is-- is--

10:35.425 --> 10:37.059
Spaghetti a la Boom!

10:37.093 --> 10:38.695
Ooh! I got a hint.

10:38.728 --> 10:40.563
Popcorn kernels.

10:42.131 --> 10:45.101
So, everyone,
let's get cooking!

10:45.134 --> 10:46.503
Good luck!

10:50.807 --> 10:53.410
I deserve a little
"attagirl."

10:53.443 --> 10:55.678
A little "Bubbleisha done good."

10:55.712 --> 10:57.414
I'm gonna get it.

10:57.447 --> 10:59.081
How hard can cooking be?

11:02.685 --> 11:06.623
Last one to the ingredients is
a squeaky shopping cart wheel!

11:06.656 --> 11:10.560
It's not who gets there
first, but who finds the stuff first.

11:10.593 --> 11:13.530
And we're great stuff finders.
Right, team?

11:13.563 --> 11:15.732
We're the stuffiest finders
around!

11:15.765 --> 11:18.435
Watch out! Incoming cans!

11:22.138 --> 11:24.474
Sorry! You okay?

11:26.175 --> 11:28.645
The cereal boxes
cushioned our wreck.

11:28.678 --> 11:31.781
Who says breakfast isn't the
most important meal of the day?

11:31.814 --> 11:33.716
Ready to grab spaghetti!

11:33.750 --> 11:36.118
Three, two, one...

11:36.152 --> 11:37.754
Grab!
Get it, Kooky!

11:37.787 --> 11:39.188
Get it!

11:39.221 --> 11:40.623
Kooky!

11:40.657 --> 11:42.058
Aah.

11:45.127 --> 11:46.529
Whoo!

11:46.563 --> 11:49.165
You almost ended up in Aisle Splat.
Thanks.

11:49.198 --> 11:51.434
I believe you dropped this.

11:51.468 --> 11:54.471
Kooky! I thought
you'd been pasta'd!

11:54.504 --> 11:56.473
And, you, Donatina.

11:56.506 --> 11:58.575
Spettacolare!

11:58.608 --> 12:00.710
One meatball,
if you please.

12:00.743 --> 12:03.480
Thank you very much.
And to you, Sprinkles.

12:04.747 --> 12:07.083
And another, my cooking chum.

12:07.116 --> 12:09.552
Much obliged, my apple amigo.

12:09.586 --> 12:10.920
- Buddy.
- Acquaintance.

12:10.953 --> 12:12.489
- Pal!
- Comrade.

12:12.522 --> 12:14.491
- Bestie.
- Girlfriend!

12:14.524 --> 12:17.193
I don't want to
break up your love fest, but...

12:17.226 --> 12:19.428
a little help!

12:22.765 --> 12:24.534
Tomato sauce!
Got it!

12:24.567 --> 12:26.168
Onions!
Got 'em.

12:27.570 --> 12:29.606
Onions are the saddest
of veggies.

12:29.639 --> 12:30.907
Oh!

12:30.940 --> 12:32.775
Parmesan cheese!

12:38.848 --> 12:41.651
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:41.684 --> 12:44.654
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:46.255 --> 12:49.626
Oh, my. What a wonderful
chopping job you did.

12:49.659 --> 12:52.495
Thanks.
I chop what I see.

12:52.529 --> 12:54.697
Come on. Go, girls, go!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

12:54.731 --> 12:56.833
Two cups of mushrooms.
Three cloves of garlic.

12:56.866 --> 12:58.868
Add the olive oil, anchovies,
mustard and parsley.

12:58.901 --> 13:01.237
Two pinches, a tweak
and a pinkie of oregano!

13:01.270 --> 13:03.840
Two what of what's
with a pinkie what?

13:05.942 --> 13:07.243
Thanks!

13:07.276 --> 13:09.245
Don't mention it.
Really. Don't.

13:09.278 --> 13:11.881
And, um, uh,
you're doing a great job.

13:11.914 --> 13:13.883
Thanks again!

13:13.916 --> 13:16.619
I did a great job too.

13:16.653 --> 13:18.220
Get back to it!

13:19.656 --> 13:21.524
How much spaghetti?

13:21.558 --> 13:25.194
Says exactly 100 strands.

13:25.227 --> 13:27.797
One piece of spaghetti.
Two pieces of spaghetti.

13:27.830 --> 13:31.601
Three pieces of spaghetti.
I, um, think that's 100.

13:32.268 --> 13:33.536
Really?

13:33.570 --> 13:34.837
One piece of spaghetti--

13:34.871 --> 13:36.739
Here. Let me.

13:38.307 --> 13:40.843
Thanks. We might have
been here all month.

13:40.877 --> 13:42.912
Oh. She's doing
a good job though.

13:46.348 --> 13:50.019
I wonder if spaghetti
has its own spaghetti needs,

13:50.052 --> 13:53.723
or if it's just boiling
in a sea of self-doubt.

13:53.756 --> 13:55.758
Okay, everyone. Everyone.

13:57.026 --> 13:59.562
Everyone?
Listen up!

13:59.596 --> 14:01.297
Oh, my!

14:01.330 --> 14:03.299
All right, everyone.
Let me explain.

14:03.332 --> 14:06.202
It's time to put
the popcorn in.

14:06.235 --> 14:10.239
So, carefully lower the kernels
into your heated sauce.

14:10.272 --> 14:12.942
I say again-- carefully,

14:12.975 --> 14:15.645
or you might get a big ka-boom!

14:15.678 --> 14:17.747
I like ka-booms.

14:22.852 --> 14:24.654
Kernels in the hole!

14:27.857 --> 14:29.759
Yeah, we did it!

14:29.792 --> 14:31.594
You can do it, Donatina!

14:31.628 --> 14:33.730
Go, Donatina! Go!

14:33.763 --> 14:35.665
One popcorn kernel,

14:35.698 --> 14:38.668
two popcorn kernels,
three popcorn kernels.

14:38.701 --> 14:40.703
Let me!

14:44.674 --> 14:47.009
Uh, did it work?
Did it work?

14:49.879 --> 14:52.348
- I hope I do this okay.
- Don't worry! We'll help!

14:52.381 --> 14:53.950
Whoa!

14:53.983 --> 14:55.084
Oh, no!

14:56.418 --> 14:57.820
Whoa!

14:58.721 --> 14:59.789
Ow!

15:03.359 --> 15:04.727
Oh, no!

15:10.667 --> 15:13.069
This is so clashing
with my shoes.

15:16.873 --> 15:19.308
I like it
when the meatballs blow up.

15:50.372 --> 15:54.110
You, um-- You, um-- Hmm?
You, um--

15:54.143 --> 15:56.713
What she's trying to say
is that you all passed.

15:58.915 --> 16:02.318
But this one really put the
"boom" in Spaghetti a la Boom!

16:02.351 --> 16:03.986
Great job!

16:04.020 --> 16:06.756
Great job! Great job!
Great job!

16:06.789 --> 16:09.358
We're gonna do better next time,
right, girls?

16:09.391 --> 16:11.761
It doesn't matter.
We all passed.

16:11.794 --> 16:14.764
Well, I think
we can pass better.

16:14.797 --> 16:17.767
I mean, don't we deserve
a little recognition too?

16:17.800 --> 16:20.369
Um, uh, your next recipe
will be--

16:20.402 --> 16:22.772
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Let me hand out the sheets.

16:25.742 --> 16:26.809
Ready?

16:26.843 --> 16:28.477
Your challenge is to build

16:28.510 --> 16:30.780
a chili-chocolate
leaning tower of licorice.

16:30.813 --> 16:32.481
The higher and chillier,
the better!

16:32.514 --> 16:34.150
Go! Cook!

16:35.885 --> 16:36.886
I think...

16:36.919 --> 16:38.187
I'm... doing...

16:38.220 --> 16:40.356
something... wrong.

16:40.389 --> 16:43.059
Nope, you're doing great,
Donatina!

16:43.092 --> 16:46.095
We're not just going to use
any ol' plain chili,

16:46.128 --> 16:49.832
we're going to grow
an ulti-milli-vanilli chili

16:49.866 --> 16:51.768
with these super-grow seeds!

16:51.801 --> 16:53.469
So let's get farm-y, ladies.

16:53.502 --> 16:55.805
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:55.838 --> 16:58.107
Way to put your face
into it, Donatina!

17:00.076 --> 17:02.144
Uh, is that--

17:02.178 --> 17:04.012
Yes. Yes, it is.

17:07.183 --> 17:11.387
I never believed that much
licorice even existed.

17:11.420 --> 17:13.388
Okay, how do we get up there?

17:15.858 --> 17:18.861
Whoa!

17:19.862 --> 17:21.964
You did it!

17:21.998 --> 17:25.101
Oh, that's not right.
Sprinkles must not weigh enough.

17:25.134 --> 17:27.536
Thank you!
I'm glad you noticed!

17:27.569 --> 17:30.139
I've been trying to eat healthy!
So now what?

17:33.442 --> 17:35.744
I did it!
You did it!

17:37.213 --> 17:39.515
Well, I can't throw myself.

17:39.548 --> 17:40.983
It's moving!

17:41.017 --> 17:44.553
Whoa!

17:44.586 --> 17:47.990
Hey! I think something's stuck
in my hair.

18:05.041 --> 18:09.111
There's a super secret double-hidden
freezer I know about back here,

18:09.145 --> 18:11.881
that's got
what we're looking for.

18:11.914 --> 18:14.550
Then we'll see who gets told how
great and wonderful they are.

18:14.583 --> 18:16.252
You are so great!

18:16.285 --> 18:18.520
You are so wonderful!

18:18.554 --> 18:22.524
You are so great!
You are so wonderful!

18:22.558 --> 18:24.493
What is with her?

18:26.628 --> 18:30.066
What are you two staring at?
We have cooking to do.

18:57.593 --> 19:00.529
...and the lil Shopkin learned, "If
you dream big, you'll be big!"

19:00.562 --> 19:02.331
That ending
always gets me.

19:02.364 --> 19:06.268
Oh, come on. Ugh!
You've got to be kidding me.

19:06.302 --> 19:07.937
Finally!

19:13.642 --> 19:16.913
How many more locks
can there be?

19:21.283 --> 19:24.120
Okay. Glasses on.

19:24.153 --> 19:27.256
What's inside is... nuclear.

19:28.324 --> 19:30.559
Who, me?
Not happening.

19:30.592 --> 19:32.261
Just get one.

19:32.294 --> 19:35.364
Anything more may cause a rift
in the space-time continuum

19:35.397 --> 19:38.234
unleashing quantum energies of
astounding proportions... You take it!

19:38.267 --> 19:40.569
reality itself is at risk...
Come on!

19:40.602 --> 19:43.172
and it'll totally
ruin your makeup.

19:47.944 --> 19:52.648
Behold, the radioactive
lava-lava chili pepper!

19:52.681 --> 19:55.918
It's said to be hotter
than the center of the sun!

19:55.952 --> 19:56.953
Quick! Quick!

19:56.986 --> 20:00.122
Before it reaches critical mass
and warps reality!

20:00.156 --> 20:03.993
At last, my ticket
to getting noticed.

20:05.261 --> 20:08.064
You shall be
my secre weapon.

20:08.097 --> 20:11.233
Yes, you will.
Yes, you really will.

20:11.267 --> 20:14.703
And I shall love you, and squeeze
you, and we will be together always.

20:16.372 --> 20:18.674
Bubbleisha's losing it!

20:18.707 --> 20:21.177
I hope she knows
what she's doing.

20:21.210 --> 20:25.581
I fear she's dabbling in things
Shopkins were not meant to know.

20:29.718 --> 20:32.388
It's like braiding hair,
only licorice.

20:32.421 --> 20:34.323
I don't have any hair!

20:34.356 --> 20:36.092
It's okay, Sprinkles.

20:36.125 --> 20:39.061
Now you have licorice!

20:49.138 --> 20:50.639
What's that?

20:56.445 --> 21:00.649
Behold Pepperzilla!

21:04.753 --> 21:07.156
B-B-B-But that's cheating!

21:07.189 --> 21:09.225
Oh, dear.
Is that cheating?

21:09.258 --> 21:11.760
I'm cool with it.
But you guys are the boss.

21:11.793 --> 21:15.331
Judges ruling-- It's a chili,
so it's not cheating.

21:15.364 --> 21:17.733
All is fair in love and cooking.

21:17.766 --> 21:21.770
Then we will fight fire with
fire, won't we, little pepper?

21:21.803 --> 21:24.406
Do unto peppers
before they do unto you.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.208
Is the chocolate sauce ready?

21:26.242 --> 21:28.110
Glasses on!

21:32.781 --> 21:36.218
- Too much.
- No! I want to use the whole thing.

21:36.252 --> 21:38.020
Too much is never enough, Kooky!

21:40.689 --> 21:42.691
Sorry.
Got something in my throat.

21:42.724 --> 21:45.294
Unleash the lava-lava!

21:46.828 --> 21:49.298
It's working. It's working.

21:49.331 --> 21:50.399
It's--

21:50.432 --> 21:52.334
Hit the floor!

21:56.272 --> 21:59.675
You know, maybe I did put
a little too much pepper in.

22:01.410 --> 22:03.779
I can't move!

22:03.812 --> 22:05.381
Mmm.

22:15.424 --> 22:17.693
We've tasted all the recipes.
And, well, um--

22:18.827 --> 22:21.130
Uh--

22:21.163 --> 22:24.266
- Mm. Eep!
- You all passed.

22:27.436 --> 22:30.439
But was one,
you know, wonderful?

22:30.472 --> 22:32.141
Great?

22:32.174 --> 22:35.777
You are so great!
You are so wonderful!

22:35.811 --> 22:38.247
- You are so great!
- Yes, yes, yes.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.249
Cheeky's group
was wonderfully tall.

22:40.282 --> 22:41.817
Good job on the tallness.

22:41.850 --> 22:44.753
We're so tall!

22:44.786 --> 22:48.190
And Jessicake's team
was artistically great.

22:48.224 --> 22:50.126
Nice and artsy, you guys.

22:50.159 --> 22:52.461
Thank you.

22:55.164 --> 22:56.732
A-And your group was...

23:01.170 --> 23:03.839
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

23:03.872 --> 23:06.108
Water, water, water!

23:08.577 --> 23:10.779
Ahh.

23:10.812 --> 23:12.448
Okay, show's over.

23:12.481 --> 23:14.750
The next recipe is--

23:14.783 --> 23:17.586
Um, Gum Gum Fruit
Stuffed with Gum Gum Fruit.

23:17.619 --> 23:19.555
BUNCHO
Coming through.

23:19.588 --> 23:21.089
Go! Go! Go, everyone!

23:21.857 --> 23:24.860
B-B-But my compliment!

23:28.930 --> 23:33.135
Remember, uh, Gum Gum trees
are v-very moody plants

23:33.169 --> 23:36.772
and don't like to have their fruit
touched by, well, um, anyone.

23:36.805 --> 23:39.575
So, good luck and be careful.

23:39.608 --> 23:42.544
Mmm. Mmm.
Stop that, Strawbs!

23:42.578 --> 23:44.480
That's for the Gum Gum tree.

23:44.513 --> 23:47.316
Cheeky thinks the sweets will get
the tree to give us some fruit.

23:47.349 --> 23:49.285
Mmm. That works for me.

23:49.318 --> 23:51.420
I'd do anything for cake.

23:55.857 --> 23:59.628
Oh, you want
my fruit, don't ya?

23:59.661 --> 24:01.797
I can tell.

24:01.830 --> 24:04.500
Everyone wants
my luscious fruit!

24:04.533 --> 24:07.369
Well, you can't have any,
so there!

24:08.304 --> 24:10.272
And get off my lawn!

24:11.307 --> 24:13.509
Oh, but we want to trade.

24:13.542 --> 24:16.645
We have cookies and cakes.

24:16.678 --> 24:19.248
And all sorts of
yummy-for-your-tummy goodies.

24:20.682 --> 24:22.884
I've never had
any of those things before.

24:22.918 --> 24:26.255
What if I don't like them?
I don't like most things.

24:26.288 --> 24:29.291
Well, all you can do
is try and see.

24:29.325 --> 24:32.261
Say, "Aaah."

24:33.562 --> 24:35.464
Mmm, that's not bad.

24:35.497 --> 24:37.533
Maybe I'll try a little more!

24:39.435 --> 24:41.303
Mm-mmm.

24:44.373 --> 24:47.943
Um, Cheeky, do you think
eating this many sweets is good?

24:47.976 --> 24:50.312
I always get
an upset tummy when I do.

24:50.346 --> 24:52.381
We'll never get our fruit
if that happens.

24:52.414 --> 24:56.518
Ooh. Ahh. I don't feel so good.

24:56.552 --> 25:00.522
My roots are twisting up in
knots, and I'm sweating sap!

25:00.556 --> 25:02.924
No, no, no, no, no, no.

25:06.995 --> 25:08.897
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

25:08.930 --> 25:10.999
Whew, glad those are
out of the way.

25:11.032 --> 25:13.602
Sometimes you gotta clear
the old food hole.

25:13.635 --> 25:15.871
I feel much better now.

25:15.904 --> 25:18.240
You three girls are
the sweetest.

25:18.274 --> 25:19.375
Thanks.

25:19.408 --> 25:22.711
Now, how about some more of
those little icing thingies?

25:22.744 --> 25:25.881
Great.
More compliments.

25:25.914 --> 25:28.450
You have the greatest
natural curl to your leaves.

25:28.484 --> 25:30.018
How do you do it?

25:30.051 --> 25:31.720
Uh, gusts of wind
and small beetles?

25:31.753 --> 25:33.522
It's to die for.

25:33.555 --> 25:35.891
And when I get done
with this "stemicure,"

25:35.924 --> 25:37.926
you're gonna feel
like a whole new tree.

25:37.959 --> 25:40.929
The polish is going to totally
highlight your bark.

25:40.962 --> 25:43.632
Really? I like shiny bark.
Who doesn't?

25:43.665 --> 25:46.034
And it brings out the color
of your roots too.

25:46.067 --> 25:48.604
I'm going to be a new tree.

25:48.637 --> 25:50.739
Wow. How nice was the tree

25:50.772 --> 25:54.009
to give us all this fruit
just for being friendly?

25:54.042 --> 25:57.346
That is the sweetest
and most stylish tree I know.

25:57.379 --> 25:59.681
Great. Even the tree
gets compliments.

25:59.715 --> 26:03.685
Okay, our turn.
And I've got just the plan.

26:03.719 --> 26:07.356
I gotta get out more,
branch out and meet new people.

26:07.389 --> 26:10.258
Today has really
broadened my horizons.

26:15.797 --> 26:18.567
Ha. Ha.
All's fair in love and cooking!

26:18.600 --> 26:22.003
I'll teach you to scare a poor
defenseless tree.

26:22.037 --> 26:23.939
Aaah.

26:23.972 --> 26:25.641
How 'bout this one?

26:25.674 --> 26:26.942
More fruit for me.

27:45.487 --> 27:47.789
Oh, my. I, um--
Really, it's, um--

27:47.823 --> 27:50.492
It's all quite wonderful.

27:50.526 --> 27:52.728
Um, you all...
passed.

27:55.163 --> 27:57.433
You did great, Kooky!

27:57.466 --> 27:59.067
Oh, you too, Lippy.

27:59.100 --> 28:00.736
You were wonderful.

28:00.769 --> 28:02.771
Don't say another word.

28:03.772 --> 28:06.041
Just, um, one last recipe,

28:06.074 --> 28:08.510
and I bet you all make it
into Chef Club.

28:10.679 --> 28:13.749
There's got to be something I can
do to get noticed around here.

28:15.183 --> 28:18.153
The last, uh, recipe is, um--

28:18.186 --> 28:19.821
Coming through.

28:19.855 --> 28:24.626
Upside-Down Loopy Hoopy Soup
with real loopy hoops.

28:24.660 --> 28:26.828
One for you, one for you,
one for you.

28:27.929 --> 28:29.765
Huh?

28:29.798 --> 28:32.067
Hmm?

28:48.884 --> 28:51.920
Well, you see, I was thinking
that if we take this,

28:51.953 --> 28:54.556
and then we, uh-- uh-- Huh?

29:19.247 --> 29:20.181
Hmm.

29:20.982 --> 29:22.618
We need an edge.

29:22.651 --> 29:23.819
No way.

29:23.852 --> 29:26.154
I get paper cuts too easily.

29:26.187 --> 29:29.224
No. An edge to do better
than the others.

29:29.257 --> 29:31.226
Like, cheating?

29:31.259 --> 29:33.562
No, no, no, no, no. Sorta.

29:33.595 --> 29:35.697
But not. Just...

29:35.731 --> 29:39.134
something to make sure we do a
better job than the others.

29:39.167 --> 29:42.604
But we want everyone to get
into Chef Club, right?

29:42.638 --> 29:46.174
Yes. I just want us to get
in ahea of everyone

29:46.207 --> 29:48.644
so people notice
and say nice things about me.

29:48.677 --> 29:50.478
Uh, us.

29:51.880 --> 29:55.584
Don't worry. I just need you two
to hold the rope.

30:00.622 --> 30:02.524
Whoa.

30:16.204 --> 30:17.906
Whoa.

30:19.675 --> 30:21.543
Hurry.
Take the recipes.

30:21.577 --> 30:25.313
There. Now we have the right
recipe and they don't.

30:25.346 --> 30:27.816
It's dinner take all.

31:19.635 --> 31:23.238
If only they knew their recipes
had the wrong amounts.

31:25.907 --> 31:28.043
Upside-down...

31:28.076 --> 31:32.648
Peppa says, "Don't forget to put the ingredients
in upside down, or it won't taste right."

31:36.952 --> 31:39.955
Oh, dear. Um, I don't know
how to say this--

31:39.988 --> 31:41.890
I do.
Needs more salt.

31:41.923 --> 31:44.325
I calculate
one single grain more.

31:50.732 --> 31:51.967
Oh, yes.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.603
How'd she do that?
I have no idea.

31:57.072 --> 31:59.641
I see you're making extra
for everyone?

31:59.675 --> 32:01.342
Nope.
It's what the recipe says.

32:01.376 --> 32:02.644
See?

32:02.678 --> 32:04.045
Oh, dear.

32:04.079 --> 32:05.981
This doesn't look right.

32:06.014 --> 32:08.016
No, no.
The amounts aren't right at all.

32:08.049 --> 32:10.351
Oh, dear.
The amounts...

32:10.385 --> 32:12.287
are all wrong?

32:13.454 --> 32:15.390
But how?

32:17.726 --> 32:19.761
Do, do. Da-da-da-da.

32:35.176 --> 32:36.344
Hey.

32:42.183 --> 32:46.387
Well, two can play at that game.

32:50.458 --> 32:52.460
Did I do that?
Huh.

32:52.493 --> 32:55.697
Hey. You almost
got it in my soup!

32:55.731 --> 32:57.799
Food fight!

32:59.935 --> 33:02.103
Whoa!
Hey.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.082
Oh, dear. Ohh, dear.

33:26.061 --> 33:28.096
- Oh.
- Oh.

33:49.918 --> 33:51.152
Ohh.

34:05.466 --> 34:07.002
Whoa!

34:07.035 --> 34:08.503
Oh, no. Kooky!

34:08.536 --> 34:09.971
We have to help her.

34:12.007 --> 34:14.475
Wait for us!
We'll help too!

34:14.509 --> 34:17.478
Come on. Let's hear
those compliments!

34:17.512 --> 34:19.114
"Great mess, Bubbleisha."

34:19.147 --> 34:21.850
"Nice destruction
of the kitchen, Bubbleisha."

34:21.882 --> 34:25.920
"Wonderful way you blew up the soup and
sent Kooky to certain doom, Bubbleisha."

34:25.954 --> 34:28.123
Wait. Kooky?

34:28.156 --> 34:29.824
Kooky!

34:29.858 --> 34:32.060
What did I do?
I'll fix it.

34:32.092 --> 34:33.460
But... how?

34:36.864 --> 34:40.501
Whoa. Whoa. W-Whoa!

34:40.534 --> 34:43.170
Whoa!

34:43.204 --> 34:47.475
Faster. Faster. We have to get ahead
before Kooky smashes or goes under!

34:47.507 --> 34:49.143
Whoa.

34:57.085 --> 34:59.220
Gotta be something.
Gotta be something.

34:59.254 --> 35:01.522
I knew something
was stuck in my hair!

35:01.556 --> 35:02.490
Grab hold.

35:05.226 --> 35:07.562
Oh, this is so not fun.

35:07.595 --> 35:09.898
Green is not my color.

35:11.933 --> 35:14.269
Whoa.

35:14.302 --> 35:15.904
Hi, there.

35:15.937 --> 35:17.572
We're rescuing you, Kooky.

35:17.605 --> 35:18.874
Wait.

35:21.042 --> 35:22.911
But now
who's going to rescue us?

35:27.916 --> 35:29.150
What do we do now?

35:29.184 --> 35:30.585
Get some crackers?

35:30.618 --> 35:32.921
Soup always goes better
with crackers.

35:32.954 --> 35:34.555
We better do it fast.
Look.

35:35.256 --> 35:37.025
Did someone say fast?

35:38.293 --> 35:39.560
Jump in!

35:42.230 --> 35:47.068
Grab a spoon and paddle like Kooky's
life depends on it... 'cause it does!

35:47.102 --> 35:48.836
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!

35:51.206 --> 35:52.941
What can we do?

35:52.974 --> 35:54.575
Try to keep up.

36:08.123 --> 36:10.225
It's now or never ever!

36:10.258 --> 36:11.927
Jump for it!

36:13.094 --> 36:14.963
Whoa.

36:16.631 --> 36:19.534
Can't let anything bad happen
to my teammate.

36:21.669 --> 36:23.338
Paddle the other way
in reverse!

36:28.209 --> 36:31.012
What now?
My paddle's pooping out.

36:31.046 --> 36:32.547
Anything we can do to help?

36:34.215 --> 36:36.985
Oh, thank you. Thank you,
thank you for lending a hand.

36:37.018 --> 36:38.553
Besties help besties.

36:42.090 --> 36:45.126
Hold on tight.
And... one, two, three--

36:45.160 --> 36:47.562
- Pull!
- Hang on!

36:47.595 --> 36:50.565
Whoa!

36:53.701 --> 36:54.970
That scared me there.

36:57.738 --> 36:59.007
Whoa.

37:01.042 --> 37:02.110
Whoo.

37:06.281 --> 37:07.915
Ohh.

37:10.151 --> 37:12.020
What can we do?

37:12.053 --> 37:15.156
Start cleaning up, I guess.

37:15.190 --> 37:17.592
But where do we even begin?

37:31.672 --> 37:33.208
All better.

37:34.342 --> 37:35.376
Huh?

37:35.410 --> 37:37.145
Ohh!

37:52.093 --> 37:53.161
Aaah.

37:55.463 --> 37:57.265
What do we do now?

37:57.298 --> 37:59.367
All our soups are souped.

37:59.400 --> 38:03.171
I guess...
no Chef Club for us.

38:03.204 --> 38:05.640
I'm gonna miss this place.

38:05.673 --> 38:07.708
Oh. Aw.

38:17.485 --> 38:19.087
Thank you.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.022
Thank you.

38:21.056 --> 38:22.423
Thank you very much.

38:26.394 --> 38:28.029
What are they doing?

38:28.063 --> 38:29.664
Having lunch?

38:31.766 --> 38:34.369
But how can anyone tell
whose recipe is whose?

38:34.402 --> 38:36.071
They're all mixed up.

38:37.272 --> 38:39.340
Mmm!

38:39.374 --> 38:43.378
And it's all
so good, you all pass.

38:43.411 --> 38:45.313
Huh?

38:50.751 --> 38:55.156
Congratulations, you're all
official members of the Chef Club.

38:58.426 --> 39:03.498
And, um, all thanks to Bubbleisha for
saving the day and being very brave.

39:03.531 --> 39:06.834
You are so great!
You are so wonderful!

39:06.867 --> 39:08.503
You did such a good job!

39:08.536 --> 39:10.705
Yay, Bubbleisha!

39:12.473 --> 39:14.775
I don't deserve
your compliments.

39:14.809 --> 39:17.245
Even though I wanted them more
than anything in the world.

39:18.446 --> 39:20.248
I wanted them too much.

39:22.817 --> 39:25.386
But you do deserve them.
You saved Kooky.

39:27.255 --> 39:31.259
But I put her in danger, and all
because I wanted a compliment.

39:31.292 --> 39:33.861
Just one,
silly little compliment.

39:33.894 --> 39:36.331
But you get compliments
all the time.

39:36.364 --> 39:39.267
Why just the other day, um--

39:39.300 --> 39:42.203
Uh, didn't she get a compliment
for-- Hmm.

39:43.804 --> 39:45.039
Wow.

39:45.072 --> 39:49.144
Maybe we have been a little short
in the compliments department.

39:49.177 --> 39:50.345
We're sorry.

39:50.378 --> 39:52.513
Sorry.

39:52.547 --> 39:55.850
- I'm serious. No one can shop like you.
- You're pretty fantastic.

39:55.883 --> 39:59.287
Your hair is pretty, and I really
like the way you say Gum Gum.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.556
You're the best cook
I've ever seen!

40:01.589 --> 40:03.358
Your outfits are always
so adorable.

40:03.391 --> 40:05.426
You always give 100 percent.

40:05.460 --> 40:08.263
- You're super funny.
- You make people laugh.

40:08.296 --> 40:11.766
You are so great!
You are so wonderful!

40:11.799 --> 40:15.336
You are so great!
You are so wonderful!

40:15.370 --> 40:17.272
Okay! Okay!

40:17.305 --> 40:19.440
Thanks for the compliments.

40:20.508 --> 40:22.777
You forgive me?
Of course.

40:22.810 --> 40:25.313
'Cause you're the greatest
at getting me into trouble...

40:26.314 --> 40:28.149
and getting me out of it.

40:28.183 --> 40:30.418
Aw.

40:30.451 --> 40:32.587
So, now that's settled,
and we're in,

40:32.620 --> 40:35.223
when do we meet
the other Chef Club members?

40:35.256 --> 40:37.492
- Yeah.
- We want to meet them.

40:37.525 --> 40:40.295
Well, um, you're it.

40:40.328 --> 40:41.496
Us?

40:41.529 --> 40:43.431
There are no other members

40:43.464 --> 40:47.468
because, you see, um,
we kind of, um, ah, well, uh--

40:47.502 --> 40:49.270
Invented Chef Club.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.842
We're new here,

40:54.875 --> 40:57.612
and it was just a way
to-- to make friends.

40:57.645 --> 41:02.250
And you girls are such good
friends, so nice, so caring

41:02.283 --> 41:06.153
and we hope-- really hope--
you'll all be our friends too?

41:14.429 --> 41:15.896
Well, yay.

41:15.930 --> 41:17.932
Who doesn't want more friends?

41:20.568 --> 41:21.869
Party!

41:21.902 --> 41:24.572
Party! Party! Party!

41:24.605 --> 41:26.874
Since we all know
how to cook now,

41:26.907 --> 41:29.510
we can make the biggest
feast ever!

41:29.544 --> 41:31.546
