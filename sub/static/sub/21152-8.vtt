00:12.800 --> 00:14.233
- What are you reading?

00:14.300 --> 00:16.100
- Charles's ex-wife
wrote a book.

00:16.167 --> 00:18.567
It's like a thinly disguised
tell-all of their marriage.

00:18.633 --> 00:20.633
- Are you in it?
- Shh.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.600
- It's supposed to be fiction,

00:24.667 --> 00:27.133
but really it's like
a blow-by-blow account

00:27.200 --> 00:29.033
of their life,
like no holds barred.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.667
- Yeah,
no holes barred either,

00:30.733 --> 00:31.933
judging from the time
she spent in LA.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.900
- You know what?

00:33.967 --> 00:35.867
I'm actually not really supposed
to let you be reading this.

00:35.933 --> 00:38.067
- I'm not reading.
I'm--I'm stretching.

00:38.133 --> 00:39.533
Wait, wait, no, no,
don't turn that page.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.133
It's really good, Kelsey.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.267
- God, it's so well-written.

00:44.333 --> 00:45.767
- Oh, who cares?

00:45.833 --> 00:47.100
I just want to hear
about you and Charles

00:47.167 --> 00:49.100
almost having sex
on his desk.

00:49.167 --> 00:51.567
- Ugh! I don't know
what happened, Maggie.

00:51.633 --> 00:52.900
I just--I, like, went for it.

00:52.967 --> 00:54.433
I wasn't even thinking.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.700
- Well, good.
- No, not good.

00:56.767 --> 00:58.733
I would have had
to have told him my age,

00:58.800 --> 01:01.200
and that would mean breaking
the promise I made with Kelsey.

01:01.267 --> 01:02.600
And then out of nowhere,

01:02.667 --> 01:04.467
Pauline shows up
with this book.

01:04.533 --> 01:06.067
It's like the universe is
slamming the brakes on us.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.500
- Oh, don't blame the universe.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.933
It's a nutjob ex-wife
that caused this.

01:10.067 --> 01:11.600
- Maybe she's not a nutjob.

01:11.667 --> 01:13.467
- She completely lied to you
about who she was.

01:13.533 --> 01:14.733
- Yeah, what kind of nutjob
would do that?

01:14.800 --> 01:15.967
[rooster crows]

01:16.067 --> 01:17.067
- Did you hear that?

01:17.067 --> 01:18.400
- Since 6:00 a.m.

01:18.467 --> 01:20.733
- I think it's coming
from the roof.

01:26.733 --> 01:28.067
- What the hell?

01:28.133 --> 01:30.133
- Oh, good morning.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.067
I'm Dean, and this is
my husband, Joe.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.633
- Hello.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.467
- I think the co-op board
clearly stipulates

01:35.533 --> 01:36.633
no cock on the roof.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.400
- Oh, my God, I love you.

01:38.467 --> 01:40.167
- [laughs]

01:40.233 --> 01:41.600
Ladies, help yourself
to some freshly laid eggs.

01:41.667 --> 01:43.200
- We just opened

01:43.267 --> 01:44.867
our farm-to-table restaurant,
Yarrow.

01:44.933 --> 01:46.400
It's down on Havemeyer.
Have you seen it?

01:46.467 --> 01:47.667
- Hey, I walked by there
the other day.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.300
Yeah, it's a beautiful space.

01:49.367 --> 01:50.467
- Well, now that you've been
to the farm,

01:50.533 --> 01:52.067
you have to come to the table.

01:52.067 --> 01:53.433
- Yes, please;
it's the least we can do

01:53.500 --> 01:54.933
to make up
for all this noise.

01:55.067 --> 01:57.333
- How's tomorrow night?
- Perfect.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.533
- You won't believe your mouth.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.900
[light, upbeat music]

02:01.967 --> 02:08.367
* *

02:09.900 --> 02:11.800
- Okay, okay,
did you read page 58?

02:11.867 --> 02:14.067
- Yes, and I'm trying very hard
to forget I ever did.

02:14.133 --> 02:16.700
- Oh! I mean, who knew
Charles had it in him?

02:16.767 --> 02:18.567
He's so buttoned up.

02:18.633 --> 02:20.567
I mean, how am I ever gonna
look at him the same way again?

02:20.633 --> 02:22.533
- Yeah, but it's not Charles.
It's Carl.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.233
- Did you read page 58?

02:24.300 --> 02:25.700
- I am still sweating.

02:25.767 --> 02:27.467
- Stay professional, Kelsey.

02:27.533 --> 02:29.233
There are so many
salacious details in this book.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.700
It is gonna be huge.

02:30.767 --> 02:32.600
And the prose
is literary grade.

02:32.667 --> 02:33.900
- She really does have
a voice.

02:33.967 --> 02:35.500
- No one is more shocked
than me.

02:35.567 --> 02:36.533
I mean, I knew Pauline
wrote a few articles

02:36.600 --> 02:38.133
for "Allure" and "Elle,"

02:38.200 --> 02:39.700
but I thought
after she had the kids,

02:39.767 --> 02:41.400
she just stopped writing
to join the ranks

02:41.467 --> 02:43.067
of the undernourished
mommy zombies

02:43.067 --> 02:44.500
of the Upper East Side.

02:44.567 --> 02:45.700
- Good morning.

02:45.767 --> 02:47.200
- Charles.
- Morning.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.733
- Hi.
- Diana, can I speak to you?

02:48.800 --> 02:50.067
- - Of course.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.800
Liza, anal--
coffee, coffee, eh--

03:02.933 --> 03:04.333
- You read it?

03:04.400 --> 03:06.633
- I did.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.067
It's good.

03:08.067 --> 03:09.233
- I know.

03:12.867 --> 03:14.400
I honestly have no idea
how to handle this.

03:14.467 --> 03:17.333
- Well, if someone else
publishes it,

03:17.400 --> 03:19.533
then you are cannon fodder
for the New York media.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.933
But if you publish it,
you seem like the bigger person,

03:23.067 --> 03:25.467
and you get to control
the narrative.

03:25.533 --> 03:26.933
- Publish it.
[door opens]

03:27.067 --> 03:28.667
And have my private life
spilled out

03:28.733 --> 03:30.233
for everybody to see?
No, thank you.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.300
I'll have our lawyers
shut her down.

03:32.367 --> 03:34.233
I'll serve her
a cease-and-desist letter.

03:34.300 --> 03:35.933
- I will find out
what our options are.

03:36.067 --> 03:38.200
Liza, get Legal on the phone.

03:38.267 --> 03:39.533
- There's always time
for lawyers.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.133
Why not just talk
to her first?

03:41.200 --> 03:42.867
Look, the reason Pauline
came to PitchFest

03:42.933 --> 03:44.433
and gave me the book

03:44.500 --> 03:47.400
was because she wanted
to get your attention.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.067
- Yeah, well, it's true

03:49.133 --> 03:50.533
I haven't been communicating
with her directly,

03:50.600 --> 03:52.067
but I've been--

03:54.300 --> 03:56.267
Well, it's been difficult.

03:56.333 --> 03:57.667
- Have dinner with her
tonight.

03:57.733 --> 04:00.367
I'd be happy
to stay with the kids.

04:00.433 --> 04:03.267
- That's very kind of you.

04:03.333 --> 04:04.967
I'll think about it.

04:05.067 --> 04:07.167
- Whatever you decide to do,
do it quickly.

04:07.233 --> 04:09.067
I have sources out there
who say

04:09.133 --> 04:11.367
there are other publishers
who've heard about the book

04:11.433 --> 04:12.967
and are circling.

04:13.067 --> 04:15.600
- Yeah.

04:25.133 --> 04:26.333
- You can go now.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.700
- Okay.

04:32.867 --> 04:35.800
[rock music]

04:35.867 --> 04:42.800

04:42.867 --> 04:44.300
- [shrieks]

04:44.367 --> 04:45.933
Who are you?
I have pepper spray.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.200
- No, no, no, no, I'm Ethan.

04:47.267 --> 04:48.200
- I don't care
what your name is!

04:48.267 --> 04:49.200
Get out!

04:49.267 --> 04:50.300
- Whoa, whoa!

04:50.367 --> 04:51.833
Diana, this is my son.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.067
- Your son?

04:54.067 --> 04:55.500
Your son...Ethan.

04:55.567 --> 04:57.133
- Yes, that was
the big surprise.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.867
My little man
is in the house.

04:58.933 --> 05:00.800
[chuckles]

05:00.867 --> 05:02.333
- Your son.
Yeah.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.933
- Hey, can I get
the Wi-Fi code?

05:04.067 --> 05:05.067
- Yeah, of course, buddy.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.200
It's "Middlemarch."

05:06.267 --> 05:07.667
- Oh, and did you remember

05:07.733 --> 05:08.667
the ice cream
and the Reddi-wip?

05:08.733 --> 05:10.200
- You bet.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.533
- Nice one, Dad.

05:13.767 --> 05:15.900
- Richard.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.700
A moment, please?

05:17.767 --> 05:19.100
- Yeah.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.200
- What is going on?

05:25.267 --> 05:28.067
I was expecting champagne
or maybe a double orchid.

05:28.067 --> 05:29.433
- I knew you'd be surprised.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.800
- Please explain.

05:30.867 --> 05:32.600
Isn't Ethan in college?

05:32.667 --> 05:34.800
- He decided to take a pause.

05:34.867 --> 05:36.700
- A pause.

05:36.767 --> 05:38.533
With one semester left.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.600
- That's why his mother
is so upset.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.267
She won't take him in.

05:42.333 --> 05:45.967
Do you mind if he stays here
for a few nights or--

05:47.067 --> 05:50.100
- Do I mind?
Uh...

05:50.167 --> 05:52.100
Of course not.

05:52.167 --> 05:53.133
- Wonderful.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.867
- [laughs]

05:54.933 --> 05:57.533
- Is it "Middlemarch"
with no spaces?

05:57.600 --> 05:59.200
- Yes.
- Obviously.

05:59.267 --> 06:02.200
[upbeat music]

06:02.267 --> 06:06.967
* *

06:07.067 --> 06:08.600
- I shouldn't be long.

06:09.867 --> 06:12.133
Thank you again
for staying with the girls.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.733
- It's no problem at all.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.400
- They don't know anything yet,

06:15.467 --> 06:18.400
and I think that it's important
to contain this.

06:18.467 --> 06:20.100
I mean, who knows;

06:20.167 --> 06:21.800
Pauline could get
on a plane again tomorrow

06:21.867 --> 06:23.933
and be gone for another year.

06:25.133 --> 06:26.967
- I, uh...

06:27.067 --> 06:28.900
Well, I wish you luck.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.667
- Um, would you mind
texting me in an hour

06:34.733 --> 06:36.333
so that I have an excuse
to leave?

06:36.400 --> 06:39.367
And now all I need
is my phone.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.733
Ah.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.800
Thank you...again.

06:45.867 --> 06:48.833
And, Liza, I want you
to know something.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.100
When Pauline walked out,

06:51.167 --> 06:53.833
I never thought that I would
stop feeling angry.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.733
And then I met you,

06:55.800 --> 06:59.500
and it was like a cloud lifted.

06:59.567 --> 07:01.567
And even if we couldn't be
together,

07:01.633 --> 07:05.067
even if you were just working
in the office,

07:05.133 --> 07:08.500
I felt like me again
around you.

07:08.567 --> 07:13.667
And I am just so grateful
that you are in my life.

07:26.733 --> 07:28.667
- Hi.

07:30.233 --> 07:31.833
- Hi.

07:31.900 --> 07:34.067
- Look, we don't have
to do small talk.

07:34.133 --> 07:36.200
I'm sorry.

07:36.267 --> 07:40.533
I'm not the same woman who
walked out on you a year ago.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.833
Can we just start there?

07:42.900 --> 07:46.267
[sprightly music]

07:46.333 --> 07:47.600
- Uh, uh, uh...
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

07:47.667 --> 07:48.933
Can you read me?

07:49.067 --> 07:50.233
- Yes.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.333
- Am I a book?
both: Yes!

07:51.400 --> 07:53.533
- Hey!
Whoo-hoo!

07:53.600 --> 07:55.367
- * Whoo, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh *

07:55.433 --> 07:58.533

08:04.500 --> 08:06.533
* Well, I don't want
to make you wait *

08:06.600 --> 08:10.133
* While I make up my mind *

08:10.200 --> 08:12.433
* No, I don't want
to make you wait *

08:12.500 --> 08:15.433
* While I make up mind *

08:15.500 --> 08:17.867
* I said oh, oh, oh *

08:17.933 --> 08:21.233
* I've got nothing but time *

08:21.300 --> 08:23.633
* Oh, oh, oh *

08:23.700 --> 08:25.933
* I've got nothing but time *

* Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh *

08:37.933 --> 08:39.267
- What time is it?

08:39.333 --> 08:41.067
- It's late.
I'm sorry.

08:41.133 --> 08:44.867
It got--well, there was
just so much...

08:44.933 --> 08:46.433
Can we talk about it
in the morning?

08:46.500 --> 08:49.100
I'm exhausted,
and I'm sure you are too.

08:49.167 --> 08:50.533
- Oh, yeah, of course.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.967
Um, is everything okay?

08:52.067 --> 08:54.467
- I called you a car.
It's arriving now.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.067
- Oh, okay.

08:56.133 --> 08:59.067
Um...
uh, good night.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.067
- Good night.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.333
- * The sky opens wide *

09:05.400 --> 09:08.600
* You close your eyes *

09:08.667 --> 09:11.733
* Now it won't find you *

09:11.800 --> 09:13.633
* *

09:18.833 --> 09:21.867
- [snoring]

09:27.633 --> 09:29.900
- How long will he be...
visiting?

09:29.967 --> 09:32.633
- Just until we get this
school thing figured out.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.433
His mother is really
digging in her heels.

09:35.500 --> 09:39.100
Not everyone has your level
of compassion.

09:39.167 --> 09:42.833
You are incredibly special
that way.

09:42.900 --> 09:46.867
- I suppose I do have
upper-level compassion.

09:50.267 --> 09:51.567
- So?
What happened last night?

09:51.633 --> 09:52.700
I'm dying.

09:52.767 --> 09:53.767
- He got home really late.

09:53.833 --> 09:55.200
He didn't say much.

09:55.267 --> 09:56.800
He was--he was
pretty exhausted.

09:56.867 --> 09:57.833
- Exhausted from what?

09:57.900 --> 09:59.267
- Talking.

09:59.333 --> 10:00.700
- Are you sure
they were just talking?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.200
- Good morning.

10:02.267 --> 10:03.767
- Good morning.

10:03.833 --> 10:05.467
- Uh, Liza, can I see you
in my office?

10:05.533 --> 10:06.733
- Of course.

10:09.033 --> 10:10.933
[whispers]
Oh, my God.

10:24.033 --> 10:26.267
- I'm sorry
I was rude last night.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.300
When things get very emotional,

10:28.367 --> 10:30.100
I have a tendency to shut down.

10:30.167 --> 10:31.167
- I know.

10:31.233 --> 10:33.000
- I suppose you would.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.700
That's one of the major themes
in Pauline's book.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.600
- No, I mean I know you.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.733
And I'm sure last night
was very difficult.

10:41.967 --> 10:44.500
- When you are
in a long marriage,

10:44.567 --> 10:46.267
it's formative.

10:46.333 --> 10:48.500
You go through profound
experiences together,

10:48.567 --> 10:51.800
like having children,
and it makes you who you are.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.767
It's like when two vines
grow together

10:53.833 --> 10:55.300
and they turn into one plant.

10:55.367 --> 10:57.467
Sometimes they grow apart,
you know,

10:57.533 --> 10:59.900
searching for sunlight
in different directions,

11:00.067 --> 11:05.633
but there is still that part
that's all twisted up together.

11:05.700 --> 11:08.067
- I can...

11:08.067 --> 11:09.433
imagine.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.233
- And that's why I have decided

11:11.300 --> 11:12.967
to publish Pauline's book.

11:13.067 --> 11:15.633
Though I take issue
with how I'm portrayed,

11:15.700 --> 11:17.667
there's a fundamental truth
to it,

11:17.733 --> 11:20.900
and I suppose she has a right
to tell her side of the story.

11:20.967 --> 11:23.200
- That's incredibly magnanimous
of you.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.267
- Pauline would still like
the book to be published

11:25.333 --> 11:27.700
by Millennial
if you are receptive to that.

11:27.767 --> 11:29.233
- Of course.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.633
I know Kelsey loves
the chapters she's read.

11:31.700 --> 11:34.433
- Pauline feels like you
in particular

11:34.500 --> 11:36.367
get the material.

11:36.433 --> 11:38.067
In fact, she even asked
if you personally could edit.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.600
But I told her
that's not going to happen.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.067
- Why not?

11:43.133 --> 11:44.233
I could guide her
through the rewrites,

11:44.300 --> 11:46.067
help protect your image.

11:46.067 --> 11:49.367
And, honestly, I really did
connect with the material.

11:49.433 --> 11:52.900
- That wouldn't be too, uh,
uncomfortable?

11:52.967 --> 11:54.400
- I've already read page 58.

11:54.467 --> 11:56.433
How much more uncomfortable
could it get?

12:00.300 --> 12:03.067
[upbeat music]

12:03.100 --> 12:07.200
* *

12:07.267 --> 12:09.400
- This is where Jake Gyllenhaal
sat last week.

12:09.467 --> 12:12.633
He practically creamed
over our parsnip puree.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.200
- He really loves
his root vegetables.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.533
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

12:18.167 --> 12:19.833
- So as our guests,

12:19.900 --> 12:21.733
everything's already been
arranged for you, okay?

12:21.800 --> 12:22.900
No menus necessary.

12:22.967 --> 12:24.200
- Thank you so much.

12:24.267 --> 12:25.500
- You're welcome.
Excuse us.

12:25.567 --> 12:26.800
The chef will look after you.

12:26.867 --> 12:28.400
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.767
- This place is so much nicer
than I expected.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.400
- I know; I can't believe
it used to be the bodega,

12:33.467 --> 12:34.900
which I miss, by the way.

12:34.967 --> 12:36.133
I mean, you can't buy
a lottery ticket

12:36.200 --> 12:37.767
in this neighborhood anymore.

12:37.833 --> 12:39.467
- Okay, I have some news.
- What?

12:39.533 --> 12:41.767
- You know that book
that Charles's wife wrote?

12:41.833 --> 12:43.367
We're gonna publish it.

12:43.433 --> 12:45.067
- You're publishing
the nutjob's book?

12:45.100 --> 12:46.233
- It could be a best-seller.

12:46.300 --> 12:47.633
I mean, and the good news

12:47.700 --> 12:49.367
is that Pauline wants me
to edit it...

12:49.433 --> 12:50.900
- Oh.
- Which is kind of a big deal.

12:50.967 --> 12:52.367
But the bad news is--

12:52.433 --> 12:55.067
- She's Charles's nutjob wife.
- Yeah.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.967
- Well, you have
the gelato and the pube.

12:58.067 --> 12:58.967
- The what?

12:59.067 --> 13:00.700
- My Uncle Frank

13:00.767 --> 13:02.433
used to go to this restaurant
in Bayside.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.667
It's a family business,
if you know what I mean.

13:05.733 --> 13:08.633
So for dessert,
the owner deserves him

13:08.700 --> 13:10.133
this big cup of gelato.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.433
It's beautiful.
It's gorgeous.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.567
But on top
is this crazy black pube

13:15.633 --> 13:16.833
just right there.

13:16.900 --> 13:17.833
So what does he do?

13:17.900 --> 13:19.300
- I do not know.

13:19.367 --> 13:21.200
- He eats it,
'cause he has to.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.300
Otherwise, he'd have a bottle
broken over his head.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.300
- These are not
analogous situations.

13:25.367 --> 13:27.567
- You got a nice thing
with a pube on top.

13:27.633 --> 13:29.467
That's all I'm saying.

13:32.833 --> 13:34.867
[phone chimes]

13:34.933 --> 13:37.467
- Zane again.

13:37.533 --> 13:39.467
I'm ghosting him.

13:39.533 --> 13:40.800
But I zombied last night.

13:40.867 --> 13:41.867
- You ate his brains?

13:41.933 --> 13:43.667
- I was drinking,

13:43.733 --> 13:45.800
and I accidentally liked
one of his Instagram posts.

13:45.867 --> 13:46.967
- Maybe that means
you still like him.

13:47.067 --> 13:48.200
- Are you kidding me?

13:48.267 --> 13:50.067
He's a total asshole.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.833
- All of your ex-boyfriends
are assholes.

13:51.900 --> 13:54.633
It's not your fault;
you got a broken picker.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.867
- That is not true.
- Oh, come on.

13:56.933 --> 13:58.067
Thad? Colin?

13:58.100 --> 13:59.533
Manorexic college boyfriend?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.067
Don't even get me started

14:01.133 --> 14:02.400
about the high school
mullet cheer boy.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.367
- All right.
What about you?

14:04.433 --> 14:05.867
- What about me?

14:05.933 --> 14:08.067
- You have
weird dodgeball girl,

14:08.100 --> 14:10.700
psychopath Amy/Montana.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.600
And I love Liza, but your picker
done you wrong there.

14:13.667 --> 14:16.200
- Okay, okay, okay.

14:16.267 --> 14:17.700
- Maybe we should
switch phones,

14:17.767 --> 14:19.200
pick each other's
Tinder dates.

14:19.267 --> 14:20.900
I bet I could do better
than you.

14:20.967 --> 14:22.567
- I know I could do better
than you.

14:22.633 --> 14:23.767
- Give me your phone.

14:23.833 --> 14:26.100
- I got a better idea.

14:26.167 --> 14:27.200
Live Tinder.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.633
- What is live Tinder?

14:28.700 --> 14:31.133
- It's a bar.
Come on.

14:35.567 --> 14:37.433
- Please tell me
that's the last course,

14:37.500 --> 14:39.167
'cause I don't think
I could take another.

14:39.233 --> 14:41.067
- Then I'll just leave you
with this.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.833
- Oh, actually, we were
invited here by the owners.

14:43.900 --> 14:45.567
- Honey, Pete Wells
just gave us three stars

14:45.633 --> 14:47.167
in "The New York Times."

14:47.233 --> 14:48.733
It's a privilege
just to eat here.

14:53.167 --> 14:55.433
- $500?

14:55.500 --> 14:57.733
- Well, there's our pube.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.100
- Hey, what about him?

15:03.167 --> 15:04.433
- He just fist-bumped
his friend, Kels.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.700
- He's hot.

15:05.767 --> 15:07.133
- You know,
that's your problem.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.567
You go after

15:08.633 --> 15:10.467
these supercompetitive
alpha male types

15:10.533 --> 15:11.900
who are just out
for themselves,

15:11.967 --> 15:13.600
and I want to find you
someone soulful,

15:13.667 --> 15:15.067
someone real.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.433
- Well, no handlebar
mustaches, okay?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.167
I don't want to be hooking up
with the guy on the Pringle can.

15:20.233 --> 15:21.667
Hey, what about her?

15:21.733 --> 15:22.700
- No, high maintenance.

15:22.767 --> 15:24.300
- How do you know?

15:24.367 --> 15:25.633
- Rhinestones
on her cell phone case?

15:25.700 --> 15:26.833
Bad sign.

15:26.900 --> 15:27.900
- How about her?

15:27.967 --> 15:29.567
- Mm.

15:29.633 --> 15:32.167
I--I think
I already slept with her.

15:32.233 --> 15:34.133
- Oh, you think.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.367
- Hey, don't judge,
zombie.

15:37.433 --> 15:39.167
- I can't believe
you paid that bill.

15:39.233 --> 15:40.767
- Well, I don't want to be
on bad terms

15:40.833 --> 15:42.600
with the people who live
directly over my head.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.933
- I should have pulled
their fire alarm on the way out.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.667
- IDs, ladies?

15:46.733 --> 15:49.300
- [laughs]
Look at my neck.

15:49.367 --> 15:52.167
Josh and Kelsey, 12 o'clock.

15:52.233 --> 15:54.933
- Oh, it's okay.
Yeah, we're good.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.300
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:56.367 --> 15:58.167
- Hey.
- You guys here to get stupid?

15:58.233 --> 16:00.067
- We already did that.
We're here for a drink.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.200
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.100
Drinks on me!
What do you guys want?

16:06.167 --> 16:07.667
- Vodka tonic.
- Me too.

16:07.733 --> 16:10.667
- Whiskey, please.
- Okeydokey.

16:11.733 --> 16:13.700
Hi.
- Hey.

16:13.767 --> 16:15.067
What can I get you, miss?

16:15.067 --> 16:16.667
- Your accent, for starters.

16:16.733 --> 16:19.333
- That's only available
in a small village

16:19.400 --> 16:21.733
30 miles outside of Dublin,
I'm afraid.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.667
- Oh, I've always wanted
to go to Ireland.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.500
I did a concentration
in Irish literature in college.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.167
- James Joyce?

16:27.233 --> 16:28.733
- I love James Joyce.
Don't get me wrong.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.333
But I secretly love
Bram Stoker more.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.500
- God love ya
and your dark and populist soul.

16:32.567 --> 16:33.700
- [laughs]

16:33.767 --> 16:35.833
- I'm Clare.
- Liza.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.400
- What are you drinking, Liza?

16:37.467 --> 16:38.833
- Oh, two vodka tonics

16:38.900 --> 16:40.200
and a Widow Jane neat,
please.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.400
- Oh, I know who that's for.

16:42.467 --> 16:44.400
Muscles over there.

16:44.467 --> 16:45.767
- You know him?

16:45.833 --> 16:47.367
- Only from here.

16:47.433 --> 16:48.833
He's in that band, right?

16:48.900 --> 16:50.067
But I can tell.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.300
Those tattoos,
the big smile?

16:52.367 --> 16:54.433
He's a player
if there ever was one.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.100
- Well, you're wrong.

16:56.167 --> 16:59.633
Josh is the kindest,
most genuine,

16:59.700 --> 17:02.367
loyal human being
I've ever met.

17:02.433 --> 17:03.400
- Is he, now?

17:03.467 --> 17:04.467
- All right.

17:04.533 --> 17:05.967
Maggie says, and I quote,

17:06.067 --> 17:07.167
"Where the hell is my drink?"

17:07.233 --> 17:08.933
- Josh, will you tell Clare

17:09.067 --> 17:10.767
what your favorite thing to do
on your birthday is?

17:10.833 --> 17:12.600
You know, the thing
that you do every single year?

17:12.667 --> 17:15.433
- I--I bake about 100 dog treats
in my house,

17:15.500 --> 17:17.067
and I bring them to the pound.

17:17.100 --> 17:18.833
Dogs go crazy for them.
They love it.

17:18.900 --> 17:21.833
- Josh, this is Clare.
Clare, this is Josh.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.700
- [laughs]

17:25.433 --> 17:26.367
Clare?

17:26.433 --> 17:27.900
- [laughs]

17:27.967 --> 17:31.433
You don't really bake
your own dog biscuits.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.933
- Yeah, I do.

17:33.067 --> 17:34.467
They're made of, like,
90% bacon,

17:34.533 --> 17:35.967
and they're delicious.

17:36.067 --> 17:39.567
I--I notice you make
your own bitters.

17:39.633 --> 17:41.500
You pick that up in Ireland
or...

17:41.567 --> 17:42.733
- Is it that obvious?

17:42.800 --> 17:45.833
- Plus the Claddagh ring.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.133
- Well, you're very observant.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.433
- I also notice the heart
is pointing outward.

17:52.500 --> 17:53.967
- And what do you know
about that?

17:54.067 --> 17:58.767
- Well, I think it means
that you are waiting

17:58.833 --> 18:00.667
for your heart to be captured.

18:00.733 --> 18:03.200
- Maybe.

18:06.933 --> 18:07.967
- [sighs]

18:11.200 --> 18:15.367
* *

18:15.433 --> 18:18.233
- Oh, it's bewildering
to Irish people.

18:18.300 --> 18:22.533
I mean, New York, New Jersey,
New Hampshire.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.867
- Wow.

18:23.933 --> 18:25.200
- All named
after English places.

18:25.267 --> 18:26.767
- Yeah.

18:26.833 --> 18:28.100
- I mean, where's your
originality, America?

18:28.167 --> 18:29.333
- Oh!
- [laughs]

18:29.400 --> 18:32.300
How about New Tahiti?

18:32.367 --> 18:34.867
- Ah, look.
Sun's coming up.

18:34.933 --> 18:36.633
- Oh, shite.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.700
- Let's go get breakfast, hmm?

18:39.767 --> 18:41.067
- I'd love to.

18:41.100 --> 18:43.467
But I've got to get
to my day job.

18:43.533 --> 18:44.567
- Ah.

18:44.633 --> 18:45.867
- Well, it's an internship

18:45.933 --> 18:47.533
at a video game
design company.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.567
- Shut up.
You design video games.

18:50.633 --> 18:53.800
- Right now, I'm just coding
a teeny part of one game.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.100
- Ah!

18:55.167 --> 18:56.867
- Which is
absolutely thrilling,

18:56.933 --> 18:59.867
but it's in Chelsea,
so I have to go.

19:02.100 --> 19:09.633
* *

19:09.700 --> 19:11.767
- Chelsea's English too,
isn't it?

19:11.833 --> 19:13.200
- [laughs]

19:14.367 --> 19:15.367
Text me.

19:15.433 --> 19:16.967
- Yeah, I will.

19:17.067 --> 19:19.567
Soon.
Like today soon.

19:19.633 --> 19:20.867
I'm gonna text you right now.

19:20.933 --> 19:23.833
* *

19:23.900 --> 19:26.967
- * You spin me
off the ground *

19:27.067 --> 19:28.733
* *

19:28.800 --> 19:30.567
- Thank you so much
for meeting me

19:30.633 --> 19:32.733
and, well, for everything.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.633
- I haven't really
done anything yet.

19:34.700 --> 19:38.067
- But you are gonna edit
my book, right?

19:38.100 --> 19:39.300
- I thought a lot about it,

19:39.367 --> 19:40.900
and I definitely want to do it,

19:40.967 --> 19:42.833
but let's just start
with the first chapter

19:42.900 --> 19:44.767
and see how we work together.

19:44.833 --> 19:47.567
If either one of us is unhappy,
we can just part ways--

19:47.633 --> 19:48.867
no harm, no foul.

19:48.933 --> 19:50.067
Sound good?

19:50.133 --> 19:51.500
- Yes.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.767
Just don't tiptoe
around my feelings.

19:53.833 --> 19:55.067
I need you to be ruthless.

19:55.133 --> 19:56.733
- Oh, I will be.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.733
- Good, because I am sick
of polite conversation.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.600
I have been drowning in it
for years.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.100
If you're gonna be my editor,

20:04.167 --> 20:06.733
I want to hear
your most brutal criticism.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.300
- Okay, you want me
to be brutal?

20:09.367 --> 20:10.600
- Yup.

20:10.667 --> 20:13.300
- Your book is wonderful.

20:13.367 --> 20:15.233
But women are not going
to understand

20:15.300 --> 20:18.400
how you could leave your kids
for a year to write it.

20:19.667 --> 20:20.700
- Fair.

20:20.767 --> 20:22.433
- Many women, most women

20:22.500 --> 20:24.100
give up a lot to be mothers.

20:24.167 --> 20:26.167
What makes you the exception?

20:26.233 --> 20:29.033
- I'm not the exception.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.533
I'm the norm.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.900
Women do the emotional labor
of the family,

20:33.967 --> 20:35.200
and it's just expected.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.033
And no one would bat an eye

20:37.100 --> 20:38.433
if a man checked out
for a while to write a book.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.600
They do it all the time.

20:40.667 --> 20:44.067
I was so tired
of being a nonperson,

20:44.133 --> 20:47.100
the wife on my
successful husband's arm.

20:47.167 --> 20:48.700
And I didn't want my girls
growing up

20:48.767 --> 20:51.167
thinking that's the norm.

20:51.233 --> 20:53.033
When I started writing again,

20:53.100 --> 20:56.433
I just found this part of myself
I thought was gone forever.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.433
And the stories I wrote
were funny and true,

20:59.500 --> 21:01.333
and they--they gave me insight

21:01.400 --> 21:04.300
into this crazy
New York literary world

21:04.367 --> 21:07.500
that had just swallowed me up.

21:07.567 --> 21:12.133
I did this for my family,
for my girls.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.300
I just hope
Charles realizes that.

21:15.367 --> 21:16.467
- Maybe you shouldn't be
so focused

21:16.533 --> 21:17.700
on what Charles thinks.

21:17.767 --> 21:19.900
- Are you kidding?
I love him.

21:19.967 --> 21:22.933
I am out of my mind for him.
I always have been.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.233
Can you understand that?

21:26.300 --> 21:28.467
- Yeah.

21:28.533 --> 21:30.233
Yeah, I can.

21:30.300 --> 21:33.433
- Look, I know he's gonna
ask you how it's going,

21:33.500 --> 21:35.767
working with me.

21:35.833 --> 21:38.267
And when he does,

21:38.333 --> 21:42.267
please be kind.

21:42.333 --> 21:44.067
- Of course.

21:47.767 --> 21:49.500
- [sighs]

21:49.567 --> 21:51.200
[mutters]

21:53.067 --> 21:54.900
Oh.
Oh.

22:02.967 --> 22:04.433
Richard?

22:04.500 --> 22:06.533
Get in here.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.533
What is this...thing?

22:11.167 --> 22:12.667
- Oh, it's a Fleshlight.

22:12.733 --> 22:14.200
- Excuse me?

22:14.267 --> 22:15.733
- It's like a flashlight
with a vagina on it.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.633
You know, it's a pocket pussy.
- A what?

22:17.700 --> 22:21.767
- Basically,
a man uses it to...

22:21.833 --> 22:23.167
pleasure himself.

22:23.233 --> 22:24.300
- Oh! Oh!

22:24.367 --> 22:27.533
Oh, g--oh, no, no, no, no.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.433
Ugh.

22:29.500 --> 22:33.100
And I assume that this--
this belongs to your son?

22:33.167 --> 22:34.967
- Oh, I'm sure it does.
Where did you find it?

22:35.067 --> 22:37.167
- Right between
my linen cushions.

22:37.233 --> 22:39.200
What are you--
what are you doing?

22:39.267 --> 22:40.733
- Well, I'm putting it back
where you found it.

22:40.800 --> 22:44.333
[laughs] I am not going
to shame my son.

22:46.767 --> 22:49.633
- You are buying me a new couch.

22:50.933 --> 22:52.833
- So how was lunch
with the pube?

22:52.900 --> 22:54.367
- She's a complicated woman.

22:54.433 --> 22:55.700
Evidently, the real reason
she wrote the book

22:55.767 --> 22:57.400
was to win Charles back.

22:57.467 --> 23:00.400
And as her editor, she wants me
to help her do that.

23:00.467 --> 23:02.967
- She is not a pube;
she is a goddamn bush.

23:03.067 --> 23:05.567
[phone chimes]

23:06.533 --> 23:08.867
- Josh.

23:10.433 --> 23:11.433
- What?

23:11.500 --> 23:12.967
- He just thanked me

23:13.067 --> 23:14.500
for setting him up
with that Irish bartender.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.133
- You're helping
both of the men in your life

23:16.200 --> 23:18.100
get with other women?

23:18.167 --> 23:20.067
- Yup, I'm gonna end up
like Jane Austen.

23:20.100 --> 23:22.067
She helped create
all these romantic relationships

23:22.100 --> 23:23.400
and died a spinster.

23:23.467 --> 23:25.067
[knocking at door]

23:25.133 --> 23:26.333
Oh.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.933
Oh.
Hi.

23:31.067 --> 23:32.433
- Don't "oh, hi" me.

23:32.500 --> 23:33.700
What did you do
with our chickens?

23:33.767 --> 23:34.733
- Hey.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.067
Want a bite?

23:36.133 --> 23:37.800
- [gasps]

23:37.867 --> 23:39.433
- You're despicable.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.800
- So is the $500 tab
from last night.

23:41.867 --> 23:44.067
- I'm calling the police.
- Go right ahead.

23:44.100 --> 23:47.100
And FYI, it's illegal to have
chickens in this building.

23:47.167 --> 23:49.100
I mean, I wasn't gonna say
anything,

23:49.167 --> 23:51.133
but as long as you're
on the phone with the police...

23:53.333 --> 23:55.067
- Whaa!
Seriously?

23:55.133 --> 23:56.233
- Nah, I called
the health department.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.433
They came this morning.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.067
This is chicken from the market.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.500
Would you like white meat
or dark meat?

24:00.567 --> 24:02.267
- Oh, my God, I love you.
[laughs]

24:09.067 --> 24:10.967
- Hey, you're in early.

24:11.067 --> 24:15.533
- Richard's son,
Richard's college-age son, it...

24:15.600 --> 24:17.300
is living with us now.

24:17.367 --> 24:18.900
- That's sweet.

24:18.967 --> 24:20.367
- He masturbates
into a rubber vagina

24:20.433 --> 24:23.200
on my linen sofa;
it's adorable.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.800
- Would you like some coffee?

24:25.867 --> 24:27.267
- Immediately.

24:28.833 --> 24:30.433
Black.
No cream!

24:30.500 --> 24:32.067
- Got it.

24:40.833 --> 24:42.567
Do you have a moment?

24:42.633 --> 24:44.433
- Yeah.
Please, come in.

24:48.233 --> 24:51.067
- I, uh--I had lunch
with Pauline yesterday.

24:51.100 --> 24:54.333
She's a lovely, intelligent
woman.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.467
- And we are separated.

24:56.533 --> 24:58.433
- Yes.

24:58.500 --> 25:01.367
But she wrote this book
as a way to reconcile with you.

25:01.433 --> 25:04.067
- Her book is not going
to get us back together.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.767
- You read the book.

25:05.833 --> 25:08.567
It's basically
Eat, Pray, Win My Husband Back.

25:08.633 --> 25:11.933
- Pauline has written
a work of fiction.

25:12.067 --> 25:15.067
My feelings for you
are real.

25:15.133 --> 25:17.400
- But she--
- Wrote a book.

25:17.467 --> 25:19.067
I know.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.233
Pauline may have made
a mess of my life,

25:21.300 --> 25:23.933
but she is not going to make
a mess of us.

25:24.067 --> 25:26.767
* *

25:26.833 --> 25:29.067
- * I can't stand a lie *

25:29.100 --> 25:31.067
* Yeah, pounding in my head *

25:31.133 --> 25:33.933
* I heard you smugly testify *

25:34.067 --> 25:36.500
* Smugly testify *

25:36.567 --> 25:38.967
* Here comes a liar *
