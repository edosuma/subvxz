00:16.684 --> 00:18.786
**

01:00.361 --> 01:02.663
Thank you, everybody! Hello.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.534
JEREMY: Thank you.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.503
Thank you so much!

01:13.441 --> 01:16.144
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you so much.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.811
This is The Grand Tour,

01:17.878 --> 01:19.980
and this week...
we've come home!

01:22.683 --> 01:25.619
We're back!
We're back in Britain.

01:27.721 --> 01:30.224
We're actually in Yorkshire,
which is...

01:30.291 --> 01:32.526
-There you go.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.028
Which is where
all three of us grew up.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.965
-Specifically--
Yeah, specifically...
-MAN: Whitby!

01:38.031 --> 01:41.635
We're in the fishing port
of Whitby. There it is.

01:45.038 --> 01:48.309
Now, Whitby,
of course, is famous
all around the world

01:48.376 --> 01:51.011
for its unbelievable
fish and chips.

01:51.078 --> 01:53.214
JAMES: With scraps.

01:53.281 --> 01:54.748
You what?

01:54.815 --> 01:56.717
Fish and chips with scraps.
You get scraps.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.453
Little bits of batter that
stay in the bottom of
the fryer.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.988
-Yeah, scraps.
-No, they're bits.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.191
-Fish and chips with bits.
-No, it's scraps.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.861
-It is bits! Bits!

02:07.928 --> 02:09.963
Right, hands up for bits.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.765
RICHARD: Wrong!
JEREMY: Scraps?

02:13.601 --> 02:15.636
-See, it's scraps.
-Don't argue with me.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.806
Because I was born
in Yorkshire.

02:18.872 --> 02:22.643
Every single one of my family
back to the 17th century's
from Yorkshire.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.678
I'm the most Yorkshire person
in the world.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.881
You know, it's funny,
cos you can't tell.
You really wouldn't know.

02:27.948 --> 02:31.585
-Yorkshire people are famous
for speaking their mind.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.754
-And when you... We...

02:33.821 --> 02:36.290
We never know
what you're thinking.
It's just...

02:36.357 --> 02:37.958
What am I thinking now?

02:38.025 --> 02:39.493
You're thinking
you're brilliant

02:39.560 --> 02:41.295
and I'm an irritating
little short-arse.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.665
-Yeah, it's just...

02:44.732 --> 02:47.134
-It's incredible!
-Yeah, I'm psychic, mate.

02:47.235 --> 02:50.338
Other things Yorkshire's
famous for: cricket.
That's not interesting.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.874
Ooh, and then there was
a TV show called
Last Of The Summer Wine,

02:53.941 --> 02:57.911
which was about three
very badly dressed old men

02:57.978 --> 02:59.513
who fell over,

02:59.580 --> 03:01.615
and everything
they ever did went wrong.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.252
-It was rubbish.
RICHARD: Yeah, terrible.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.919
I don't know why
that took off.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.488
Erm... Carmaking?

03:07.555 --> 03:08.889
Well, let's put it this way.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.624
It's not exactly the Detroit
of the British Isles.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.460
-No, it's not.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.796
But there is a lot
of motoring-related stuff
here this week,

03:15.863 --> 03:18.098
because we're in town.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.836
So, let's get on
with the show.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.372
Yes, let's.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.509
We begin in Victorian times,

03:28.576 --> 03:30.978
when James May
was a little old lady.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.749
You see, back then,
gentlemen of means--

03:35.816 --> 03:38.586
-Rich people in tweed suits.
-Yes, rich people
in tweed suits

03:38.652 --> 03:41.889
would take what was
known as the Grand Tour.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.891
They'd go off
to France or Italy,

03:43.957 --> 03:47.060
and they'd spend a few months
learning about culture

03:47.127 --> 03:48.729
and wine and music.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.299
Nowadays, of course,
everybody goes to Magaluf

03:51.365 --> 03:53.967
and learns about beer
and vomit and chlamydia.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.303
JAMES: Yeah.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.738
Now, we think
this is a real shame,

03:57.805 --> 03:59.607
so Jeremy and I went off
to Italy

03:59.673 --> 04:03.311
to do our own modern take
on the Grand Tour.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.546
A wonderful,
inspirational journey

04:05.613 --> 04:07.915
that not only gave its name
to this show,

04:07.981 --> 04:11.018
but also to 1,000 GT cars:

04:11.084 --> 04:12.520
grand tourers.

04:17.525 --> 04:21.862
JEREMY: Our start point
was the Tuscan hilltop city
of Siena.

04:24.632 --> 04:29.136
Home to the most exciting
horse race in the world:

04:29.202 --> 04:31.038
the Palio.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.850
Look at that! Wow!

04:44.718 --> 04:47.555
It was the beginning of
what would be a very fabulous

04:47.621 --> 04:49.457
and very cultured journey.

04:51.191 --> 04:54.462
We'd visit the magnificent
cities of Florence

04:54.528 --> 04:56.163
and Bologna and Verona

04:56.229 --> 04:58.131
on our way
to the finishing point

04:58.198 --> 05:01.735
in the most magnificent city
of them all:

05:01.802 --> 05:03.003
Venice.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.873
The cars we'd be driving
were fabulous, too.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.777
James had chosen
the Rolls-Royce Dawn,

05:09.843 --> 05:13.547
a new two-door, drop-head
version of the Ghost.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.385
And I'd be in the DB11,

05:17.451 --> 05:19.086
the latest in a long line

05:19.152 --> 05:23.457
of elegant and beautiful
Aston Martin grand tourers.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.561
Even its door mirrors
are beautiful.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.463
Its wheels are beautiful.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.898
This is...

05:30.964 --> 05:34.402
This is one of the most
beautiful cars I've ever seen.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.703
JAMES: Shame it's brown.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.406
-It isn't brown!
-Yes, it is.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.641
It isn't brown!
It's Sunset Orange.

05:40.708 --> 05:43.411
It's not brown in the way
that my car is green.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.745
It's brown.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.481
Your car is a convertible
BMW 7 Series.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.682
JAMES: No, it isn't.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.651
JEREMY: But is it
a 7 Series underneath?

05:50.718 --> 05:52.620
-Bits of the floor panel.
-There you go.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.789
£265,000
for a convertible 7 Series.

05:55.856 --> 05:56.924
It isn't!

05:56.990 --> 05:58.526
If you're going to drive
across Italy,

05:58.592 --> 06:00.528
which we're going to do,
taking in some culture...

06:00.594 --> 06:02.095
-Mm-hm.
-...that's what you need.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.897
-It isn't brown!

06:03.964 --> 06:07.668
-It's brown!
-Look, let's not bicker.

06:07.735 --> 06:11.271
Actually, on this occasion,
let's get on.

06:11.338 --> 06:12.773
We are both
going to drive across

06:12.840 --> 06:15.809
what is, I think, our
favourite country
in the world,

06:15.876 --> 06:18.646
enjoy some culture,
enjoy some fine wine,

06:18.712 --> 06:20.347
some food, some art, some...

06:27.087 --> 06:29.523
-Sorry I'm late.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.191
We didn't know
you were coming.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.493
We rather hoped you weren't.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.162
Well, I am, and look at
the car I've brought.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.599
Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.801
707 American horsepower,

06:40.868 --> 06:43.671
and enough torque to pull
that old building down.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.006
JAMES: Just...
That "old building" is a...

06:46.073 --> 06:47.274
Oh, well, never mind.

06:47.340 --> 06:50.811
Hammond, Tuscany, not really
the home of the muscle car.

06:50.878 --> 06:55.483
Yeah, you see, I was worried
you two were gonna be all
boring and serious.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.851
And I am here to make sure
this trip is fun

06:57.918 --> 06:59.920
because don't tell me
the original Grand Tour
wasn't fun.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.756
It was like an 18th century
Cannonball Run,

07:02.823 --> 07:05.192
only with old-fashioned
morphine instead of cocaine.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.627
This is gonna be brilliant.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.061
What's with your advertising?

07:08.128 --> 07:10.564
Well, because the Americans
used to do the Grand Tour,

07:10.631 --> 07:12.566
and they used to get sponsors
to help cover the costs,

07:12.633 --> 07:14.034
so I've got myself
some sponsorship.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.169
JEREMY: What, Bobby's...
What is a grit?

07:16.236 --> 07:17.738
That's a... It's a...

07:17.805 --> 07:19.673
a bit left over
after coffee or potatoes?

07:19.740 --> 07:21.509
-I don't know.
-Well, it's there.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.010
"Rodeo Lube 'N' Tune."

07:23.076 --> 07:25.613
RICHARD: "Lube 'N' Tune."
Yep, look at that.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.715
The things is, people will
look at me in that

07:27.781 --> 07:29.717
and know
I am on a Grand Tour.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.952
You, they'll think,
"What are these two
old farts doing?"

07:32.019 --> 07:34.021
JEREMY: Seriously--
-You have made no effort.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.123
You haven't got into
the mood for this.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.759
Art, music, culture.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.327
JAMES: Refinement.
JEREMY: Yes.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.730
JEREMY: Is this something
to do with you?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.231
RICHARD: Yes.
Yes, they're here.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.534
These are my spare tyres.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.368
Because on a trip like this,

07:48.435 --> 07:50.938
in a car with that much power
and that much torque,

07:51.004 --> 07:52.540
I am gonna get through
some tyres.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.807
-Tree.
-Yeah.

07:57.110 --> 08:00.581
That lot was not gonna fit in
the boot, or trunk, was it?

08:01.882 --> 08:03.751
That is luxury!
That is grand touring.

08:03.817 --> 08:08.589
JEREMY: Reluctantly,
we agreed to let our
vulgar colleague tag along.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.077
Ha-ha!

08:30.143 --> 08:33.213
Hammond, you're deliberately
making an irritating noise.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.447
Please stop it.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.083
I am, yeah.

08:39.119 --> 08:45.192
I will freely admit that
Hammond's Dodge Hellcat
is a remarkable car.

08:47.194 --> 08:52.299
It would be perfect
if we were at a tractor pull
in Milwaukee.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.335
But we're not. We're here.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.204
And here in Tuscany...

08:58.471 --> 08:59.840
...you need one of these.

09:12.620 --> 09:17.057
This is the all-new
replacement for the DB9,

09:17.124 --> 09:20.728
and it is the perfect car
for the job.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.497
It even comes with
three running modes.

09:24.632 --> 09:27.300
You've got Sport, Sport Plus,

09:27.367 --> 09:29.102
and the one I'm gonna use.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.139
GT.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.674
Grand Touring.

09:35.442 --> 09:40.648
Up front, there's a 5.2
litre, twin-turbocharged V12

09:40.681 --> 09:44.051
which produces
600 horsepower.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.654
And they are smooth
horsepower.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.658
Dreamy horsepower.

09:54.662 --> 09:58.198
In the fullness of time,
you'll be able to buy
a cheaper version of this car

09:58.265 --> 10:01.101
with an AMG V8.

10:01.168 --> 10:04.037
It's all part of a deal
that Aston have done
with Mercedes,

10:04.104 --> 10:06.139
and you can see evidence
of the deal already.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.876
This has got
Mercedes switchgear,
Mercedes electronics.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.111
It's even got
Mercedes sat-nav.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.948
And I've got to say...

10:15.015 --> 10:16.349
Aston Martin and Mercedes,

10:16.416 --> 10:19.987
that is the best
Anglo-German marriage

10:20.053 --> 10:22.790
since Queen Victoria
married Albert.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.526
James, though, disagreed.

10:26.593 --> 10:29.830
Actually, this is the best
Anglo-German marriage.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.170
It's perfect, in fact,
because it has all the things

10:37.237 --> 10:40.207
that we like to think of as
being Britishness in a car.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.910
The sense that it was made
by men in aprons,

10:42.976 --> 10:46.546
that there are craft skills
and traditional materials
involved.

10:46.613 --> 10:49.116
But then you've got
the Germans there,
with their hi-tech

10:49.182 --> 10:51.752
and their
manufacturing efficiency.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.022
It's absolutely wonderful.

10:56.690 --> 11:00.293
It's... It's very serene.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.830
There are a lot of numbers
I could quote on this car.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.798
You know, the usual:
top speed, power, 0-60.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.734
All that sort of
irrelevant rubbish.

11:06.800 --> 11:11.438
But I'm not going to,
because that would be,
frankly, uncouth.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.308
Oh, talking of uncouth...

11:17.978 --> 11:21.749
I'll admit,
this is not a quiet car.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.590
You've got that big bass
rumble and roar

11:30.657 --> 11:33.393
from the 6.2 litre V8 HEMI.

11:33.460 --> 11:37.330
And over the top,
that shrill, manic whine
of the supercharger.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.434
Neither is it a particularly
economical one.

11:41.501 --> 11:45.873
At full chat,
it'll chew through
its 18.5-gallon fuel tank

11:45.939 --> 11:47.808
in just 13 minutes.

11:49.777 --> 11:53.814
And, in fact, it needs
so much air to mix with all
that petrol it's drinking,

11:53.881 --> 11:56.083
they had to remove
one of the headlights

11:56.149 --> 11:58.351
and replace it
with a ram-air intake

11:58.418 --> 12:00.320
to feed air to the engine.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.956
So they swapped its eye
for a nostril.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.496
The upside of all this,
however,

12:09.562 --> 12:13.333
is that it's extremely fast.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.170
It'll do the standing quarter
faster than
a Porsche 911 GT3,

12:17.237 --> 12:19.306
but it costs, what, £50,000?

12:19.372 --> 12:22.876
You could have five of these
for one of James May's
Rolls-Royces.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.646
Oh, hello. This looks like
a tunnel opportunity.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.518
JAMES: Stop doing that!

12:33.887 --> 12:37.690
JAMES: That is
a genuinely horrible noise
that Hammond's car's making,

12:37.825 --> 12:39.827
and he just keeps doing it.

12:39.860 --> 12:44.898
He keeps stamping one pedal,
then stamping the other one,
in his binary style.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.540
Sadly, the engine noise
wasn't the only irritation.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.545
Is this just going to be
a tour of Italy's
petrol stations?

12:58.611 --> 13:01.281
Well, it depends
how far apart they are,
doesn't it, really?

13:01.348 --> 13:03.851
Look at it this way, think of
the snacking opportunities.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.853
You've come to Italy
for food.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.154
Yeah, but not crisps.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.356
No, not crisps and hideous
sausages from America.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.992
You don't know.
It'll be different
in different petrol stations.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.693
-It won't.
-It will.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.628
Are there any Renaissance
petrol stations we could visit?
Baroque?

13:15.695 --> 13:18.431
No. Nor are there any
Renaissance sausage rolls
in there.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.499
JAMES: For God's sake.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.001
Having filled up his car,

13:21.068 --> 13:24.371
and himself,
we were back on the road.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.877
A quick situation update.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.511
I'm driving through
sunny It--

13:31.578 --> 13:34.181
-Shut up!

13:34.247 --> 13:37.484
Bad news, James. I'm afraid
there's a tunnel coming up.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.186
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

13:39.252 --> 13:41.388
Don't do it, Hammond.
Just relax.
Enjoy a bit of quiet.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.559
JAMES: Stop it!

13:48.661 --> 13:50.063
You have got to love that!

13:52.099 --> 13:55.735
JEREMY: Soon, we arrived
in the Renaissance city
of Florence,

13:55.802 --> 13:59.372
a traditional stopping point
on the Grand Tour of old.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.143
Architecture.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.980
Opera di Firenze.
This is what we're here for.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.049
This is why we're here.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.384
Best of all, though,

14:11.451 --> 14:15.722
James and I
had managed to lose Hammond.

14:15.788 --> 14:19.292
JEREMY:
He's really offending you,
isn't he, with his Dodge?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.361
Honestly,
I wouldn't say this lightly,

14:21.428 --> 14:24.264
but I have developed
a genuine, deep,

14:24.331 --> 14:26.967
deep, heartfelt hatred
for that thing.

14:27.034 --> 14:31.939
I can tell. You're going to
go like Inspector Dreyfus in
the Pink Panther films soon.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.740
You're not wrong.
I've developed a twitch.

14:33.806 --> 14:36.977
When he comes near me
and I'm waiting for
that stupid noise it makes,

14:37.044 --> 14:38.478
my eye starts quivering.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.613
It's like somebody
constantly being sick on you

14:40.680 --> 14:43.316
while you're trying
to read a nice book.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.520
JAMES: As we were on our own,

14:47.587 --> 14:49.356
Jeremy and I
decided to head for

14:49.422 --> 14:51.291
the renowned
Uffizi Gallery...

14:52.559 --> 14:55.028
where we would enjoy
a bit of peace and quiet

14:55.095 --> 14:57.297
as we appreciated
its treasures.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.481
Who's hungry?
Cos it's doughnut time!

15:14.547 --> 15:15.983
Yeah!

15:17.317 --> 15:19.186
You can have that one!

15:19.252 --> 15:21.354
Put sprinkles on that!

15:21.421 --> 15:24.524
Party on the hill in...
wherever we are. Italy.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.993
Ya-ha!

15:27.194 --> 15:29.729
Finally bringing some life
into this place!

15:33.566 --> 15:36.236
JEREMY: After Hammond
had fitted some new tyres...

15:39.306 --> 15:43.176
...James and I abandoned
our visit to the Uffizi...

15:43.243 --> 15:46.113
and escorted him out of town.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.381
Hammond, we could see
the smoke from your tyres

15:48.448 --> 15:51.218
from the other side
of the city.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.619
RICHARD: I know! I know!

15:52.685 --> 15:55.455
Nobody in history has ever,

15:55.522 --> 15:58.291
ever doughnuted
an Aston Martin.

15:58.358 --> 16:01.361
Yeah, they're not
young buyers, are they?

16:01.428 --> 16:04.064
JEREMY: No,
they're refined and cultured.

16:05.498 --> 16:10.037
I envy you, Hammond,
cos you get to look at
my Aston Martin.

16:10.103 --> 16:14.041
-Yeah, but there's a big
problem with it visually.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.842
It's brown!

16:15.908 --> 16:20.047
Sunburst Orange
is what it is.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.715
RICHARD: Jeremy,
I shouldn't worry.
We all know the expression.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.052
Brown sky at night,
shepherd's delight.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.755
That bloke's been done
for that theft, you know?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.157
They caught him brown-handed.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.858
I'm starting to imagine

16:31.924 --> 16:37.064
what Richard Hammond
would look like without
a head... or skin.

16:37.097 --> 16:40.433
Once Hammond
had finished rubbishing
the Aston's colour,

16:40.500 --> 16:43.136
he started to challenge
its performance.

16:45.905 --> 16:49.742
Hammond is driving along
behind me now
like he wants to get past.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.080
Stupid boy.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.817
What is the top speed
of that car of yours?

16:57.884 --> 17:00.320
199 miles an hour.

17:01.588 --> 17:05.392
Exactly. This will do 200,
so back off.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.461
Well, yes,
but it's 100 grand more.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.630
That's a very expensive
mile an hour.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.835
JEREMY: Rather than get into
a pointless war of words,

17:15.902 --> 17:18.771
I decided
to put Hammond in his place

17:18.838 --> 17:21.174
and invited him
to pull over here...

17:22.375 --> 17:24.444
...at the Mugello race track.

17:27.914 --> 17:31.251
Why have you brought me
to this not-at-all
cultural place?

17:31.318 --> 17:35.522
Because I want
to teach him a lesson
about what real speed is.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.657
But he's got
over 700 horsepower.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.426
Yes, I know,
but you remember Jaws:

17:39.492 --> 17:40.860
big metal teeth, huge man?

17:40.927 --> 17:43.563
James Bond simply threw him
through a window,

17:43.630 --> 17:45.732
and that's
what I'm gonna do to him.

17:45.798 --> 17:49.169
-Do you mind
if I don't take part in this?

17:49.236 --> 17:50.470
I'll do it.

17:54.040 --> 17:57.377
JEREMY: So, as Hammond
had some new tyres fitted...

17:57.444 --> 18:01.581
again, I took to the track
for some sighting laps.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.621
Now, let's get one thing
straight from the start.

18:08.688 --> 18:14.694
Aston Martins are not really
designed to do track work.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.830
They're designed
to look good, and that's it.

18:19.499 --> 18:22.369
Yes, the chassis on this,
the DB11,

18:22.435 --> 18:25.071
was developed
by a former Lotus engineer,

18:25.172 --> 18:26.506
but they actually told him

18:26.573 --> 18:29.842
to tune it more for comfort
than handling.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.546
That being said,

18:33.613 --> 18:38.718
this has an aluminium chassis
and some aero trickery.

18:39.919 --> 18:43.390
Air is sucked into holes
behind the rear windows

18:43.456 --> 18:48.195
and then shot out of a vent
on the boot lid,

18:48.195 --> 18:50.230
giving me
a sort of air rear wing.

18:52.599 --> 18:55.735
Giving me grip...
a lot of grip.

18:56.903 --> 19:00.440
And the traction control
is simply astonishing.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.876
In most cars, it's like
somebody hitting you
on the head with a hammer,

19:03.943 --> 19:05.345
but in this, it's just going,

19:05.412 --> 19:08.648
"Erm... Hang on, hang on,
hang on." There you go.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.286
Bloody hellfire!
This is very, very good.

19:15.888 --> 19:20.227
Certainly it's good enough
to be able to totally destroy

19:20.293 --> 19:22.429
Hammond's idiotic Dodge.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.468
This does not have
a magnesium roof,

19:28.535 --> 19:30.603
carbon-fibre prop shaft.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.072
The engine isn't made
from aluminium,
it's made from cast iron.

19:33.139 --> 19:36.243
And you get the impression
they'd have made it
from stone if they could.

19:37.644 --> 19:41.548
What it does have
is vast reserves of power,

19:41.614 --> 19:44.116
and even vaster reserves
of character.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.752
This thing is just hilarious.

19:52.492 --> 19:55.528
Look at him
in his little brown Aston,

19:55.595 --> 19:58.331
being all in control, and
just not having fun, is he?

19:58.398 --> 19:59.832
I mean, what's the point?

20:01.534 --> 20:04.504
JEREMY: Showboating.
Probably thinks I can't.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.640
Well, I'm sorry, Hammond,
this is a 600 horsepower,

20:07.707 --> 20:09.476
rear-wheel drive
Aston Martin.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.280
So I turned
the traction control off,

20:13.346 --> 20:15.382
and all hell broke loose.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.465
It will do this all day.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.236
JEREMY: Meanwhile...

20:39.038 --> 20:41.508
JAMES: One of the purposes
of the original Grand Tour

20:41.574 --> 20:43.876
wasn't just to look at things
and learn about things.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.479
It was also to enhance
your capabilities.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.448
You would learn to do things.

20:48.515 --> 20:51.050
You might do...
I don't know,
writing sonnets,

20:51.117 --> 20:54.421
playing musical instruments,
regional cooking, maybe.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.689
I'm having a go at
watercolour painting.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.925
-It's absolutely delightful.

20:58.991 --> 21:01.328
Apart from my reverie
is occasionally interrupted

21:01.361 --> 21:05.332
by the... disgusting bellow
of Hammond's muscle car.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.970
JEREMY: Mr. Hammond appears
to have organised a helicopter

21:11.037 --> 21:12.472
to record the event.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.577
Ha-ha, Clarkson!
Get past me now!

21:18.578 --> 21:20.813
Smokescreen you.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.719
What a moron you are,
Hammond!

21:28.087 --> 21:29.622
Get out of my way!

21:32.191 --> 21:36.062
This is not a particularly
cultural thing to do...

21:36.128 --> 21:37.664
but it is very good fun.

21:45.738 --> 21:49.776
Even though Hammond and I
were having a big smoky riot,

21:49.842 --> 21:51.544
we'd learned nothing at all.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.881
So we decided
to get scientific

21:54.947 --> 21:58.418
and do a proper
timed flying lap.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.531
This matters.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.833
This is for Britain.
This is for Europe.

22:15.201 --> 22:16.403
RICHARD: No silly business.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.871
Let's just get round this
as fast as we can.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.480
JEREMY: With the flying lap
completed,

22:27.547 --> 22:29.649
we met to compare times.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.053
-Go on, then.
-All right, then. Two...

22:34.120 --> 22:35.822
-Yes.
-Yes.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.024
18 seconds...

22:38.090 --> 22:41.060
What are you?

22:41.127 --> 22:44.296
18. B-But...

22:44.431 --> 22:47.133
-No. Two minutes 18...

22:47.199 --> 22:48.435
Ooh!

22:48.501 --> 22:49.936
...point 79.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.871
Oh, thank God for that.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.873
I'm... It's crushing.
Three-five.

22:54.974 --> 22:57.009
Well, it's hardly crushing,
is it?

22:57.076 --> 22:59.211
-No, cos that's...
-I don't know why
you accepted the challenge.

22:59.278 --> 23:03.149
It's less then half a second
for your extra 100 grand.

23:04.283 --> 23:06.453
Well, hardly a big gloat,
is it?

23:08.254 --> 23:12.859
It's £100,000 for half
a second and 1mph top speed.

23:12.925 --> 23:18.197
240 years of independence and
that's the best they can do.

23:18.264 --> 23:21.534
JEREMY: As Hammond
cheered himself up
with some doughnuts...

23:22.702 --> 23:24.904
...and then
another set of tyres...

23:27.540 --> 23:29.742
...I went to join James.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.914
JEREMY:  Oh, shit.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.626
JEREMY: Agh!

23:46.693 --> 23:49.496
-Did you beat him,
by the way?
-Yeah.

23:49.562 --> 23:50.997
Good man.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.836
JEREMY: As the sun slipped
behind the Tuscan hills,

23:56.903 --> 23:59.972
we spent an enjoyable hour
or so painting.

24:01.307 --> 24:03.109
But then...

24:08.147 --> 24:10.382
Ooh.

24:10.517 --> 24:11.884
What are you doing?

24:11.951 --> 24:14.754
I'm defusing a bomb, Hammond.
What do you think I'm doing?

24:14.821 --> 24:16.188
JAMES: I'm baking a cake.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.925
-It looks like
you're painting.
-We are painting.

24:18.991 --> 24:22.394
JEREMY: Hammond
then decided he'd like
to have a go as well.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.539
RICHARD: Right.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.006
That one.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.143
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.849
JEREMY: Soon,
our art was finished.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.219
I think I've rushed mine.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.890
Still, could be worse.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.060
It was difficult,
before I saw this,

24:54.126 --> 24:57.664
to imagine anything more
hideous than the actual car.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.599
But you've done it, Hammond.

24:59.666 --> 25:04.003
It's the way that you've
managed to eradicate
any sense of place.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.572
Yeah, I know.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.279
Your twitch!
He's twitching!

25:13.345 --> 25:16.148
Even when he looks
at the picture of your car,

25:16.215 --> 25:18.585
he's actually twitching!

25:22.221 --> 25:23.590
All of the work...

25:23.656 --> 25:26.593
All of the work
that Rolls-Royce
put into that Dawn

25:26.659 --> 25:30.429
to make it quiet and refined
and sublime, and all those
things you'd expect,

25:30.496 --> 25:34.500
it all counts for absolutely
nothing if it's anywhere
near your Dodge,

25:34.601 --> 25:36.703
because that's all
you can hear.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.871
Do you know something
about that Hellcat?

25:38.938 --> 25:40.940
OK, I've done
some research into it.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.943
The Hellcat is based on
the old Chrysler 300C.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.377
Underneath,
it's the same car.

25:45.444 --> 25:50.750
And the 300C, underneath,
is a 1990s Mercedes E-Class.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.652
So what Dodge
has done with that thing,

25:52.719 --> 25:57.123
if they put 700 horsepower
in a 20-year-old taxi...

25:57.189 --> 25:58.190
that's what it is.

25:58.257 --> 26:02.795
Anyway, if you want
to listen to two old men

26:02.862 --> 26:07.399
dribble on about music
and opera whilst I have fun,

26:07.466 --> 26:09.501
there'll be more of that
later on.

26:09.636 --> 26:11.971
But now it's time for us
to check our mirrors

26:12.038 --> 26:15.708
and make a smooth left
into Conversation Street.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.351
It is.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.319
Now... I have to say,

26:27.386 --> 26:30.657
James was very, very excited
about coming to Whitby,

26:30.723 --> 26:34.426
because he'd heard
that it's the centre
of the British jet industry.

26:34.493 --> 26:36.428
He was very much
looking forward to spending

26:36.495 --> 26:38.430
a couple of days looking at
old drawings of Concord,

26:38.497 --> 26:42.468
but then he discovered that
Whitby jet is actually this.

26:43.770 --> 26:44.837
It looks like coal.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.038
-It is coal.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.707
Thing is, though,
they've worked out...

26:47.774 --> 26:49.141
Obviouasly, you can't
burn coal any more

26:49.208 --> 26:51.811
because Al Gore goes nuts
and a polar bear falls over,

26:51.878 --> 26:55.948
so they polish it up
and then say it's precious.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.985
That's interesting, this,
cos I've got the blurb here

26:59.051 --> 27:02.922
from Whitby's oldest retailer
of the stuff, and it says,

27:02.989 --> 27:05.725
"Unlike other gemstones,

27:05.792 --> 27:09.161
jet is actually
fossilised wood."

27:09.228 --> 27:12.699
Yes, because unlike
other gemstones, it's coal.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.533
-Yeah, but...

27:14.600 --> 27:16.102
-But it's...

27:16.168 --> 27:18.905
Unlike other gemstones,
Hammond, it's a lot cheaper.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.140
-Well, yes, it would be.

27:21.207 --> 27:24.210
Well, seriously, you
can get a jet ring, look,
for 32 quid.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.612
You get a sack of it
for ten quid. It's coal!

27:26.713 --> 27:27.980
-Thing is, though...

27:28.047 --> 27:29.381
We were thinking
the other day,

27:29.448 --> 27:32.819
you know carmakers now they
use bamboo, ash, walnut

27:32.885 --> 27:34.987
and carbon fibre
to decorate bits of a car?

27:35.054 --> 27:37.323
-Exactly.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.726
Anybody would like to have
some jet in their car.

27:39.726 --> 27:42.228
Actually, we've been
doing a little bit of
experimenting, Hammond.

27:42.294 --> 27:46.733
I've made a prototype.
This is a gearstick
with a jet knob...

27:47.900 --> 27:49.401
...on the top.
It's brilliant.

27:49.468 --> 27:52.071
I mean, it's not polished
yet, but you change gear.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.273
It does make your hand
a bit dirty.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.608
But, no, that's
a handy reminder. It is.

27:56.743 --> 27:58.745
Exactly. No, you're
absolutely right
'cause you know,

27:58.745 --> 28:00.379
sometimes you drive
an unfamiliar car,
you're on the motorway

28:00.446 --> 28:02.782
and you think,
"Oh, did I change into sixth?

28:02.849 --> 28:05.384
-Yeah, I did."

28:05.451 --> 28:08.354
Here's some conversation...
for Conversation Street.

28:08.420 --> 28:11.423
Erm... Bad news.
There is a problem right now
in this country.

28:11.490 --> 28:14.961
Not enough people
are learning to drive.
Seriously.

28:15.027 --> 28:19.999
In 2007, just over 16,000
driving tests were conducted.

28:20.066 --> 28:23.602
Last year,
that had dropped to 4,650.

28:23.669 --> 28:27.774
That is a true fact.
In less than ten years,
16,000 down to 4,000.

28:27.774 --> 28:28.941
And I know why.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.442
It's because kids
leave school these days,

28:30.509 --> 28:33.079
they've no idea who Hitler
was, they can't add up.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.781
They just know cars are bad.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.850
That's all they learn:
cars are bad, cars are bad,
cars are bad.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.819
Then, when they do
get out of school,
after what--

28:39.886 --> 28:41.220
after school's finished,

28:41.287 --> 28:44.290
they go around and see
speed cameras, traffic jams,

28:44.356 --> 28:47.493
signs saying "Please don't
overtake cyclists" and think,
"What's the point?"

28:47.559 --> 28:50.262
"No point learning to drive.
I might as well just use Uber."

28:50.329 --> 28:51.964
Exactly.
If I were a carmaker,

28:52.031 --> 28:54.801
I would be fighting
like a Kilkenny cat

28:54.834 --> 28:57.069
to make sure every car I made

28:57.136 --> 28:59.205
was as interesting
and as amazing as possible.

28:59.271 --> 29:02.041
But instead... Renault,
they give us the KADJAR.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.810
-How many children...

29:03.810 --> 29:06.946
How many children will say,
"If I work really hard
and do my homework,

29:07.013 --> 29:09.515
one day, maybe,
I can have a KADJAR"?

29:09.581 --> 29:11.918
RICHARD: Cos that's the car
they grow up seeing.

29:11.984 --> 29:13.252
Worse still, Nissan Juke.

29:13.319 --> 29:16.155
-You really hate the Juke.
-No, I hate it.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.057
-No, he genuinely hates...
-No, I hate...

29:18.124 --> 29:21.894
I object to it existing.
It shouldn't exist.
I loathe it.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.330
On the motorway, you
see them with their stupid,

29:24.396 --> 29:26.432
like, double bug eyes.

29:26.498 --> 29:27.733
Smug little...

29:27.834 --> 29:29.969
If I see one, I'm mad.
I can't help myself.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.838
And it's cruel, and I'm
sorry if you're in one.

29:31.838 --> 29:32.905
But I do, I see them.

29:32.972 --> 29:33.973
"I hate..."

29:35.842 --> 29:39.011
JEREMY: He does.
I was driving along with him
the other day...

29:39.078 --> 29:40.880
I was busy
telling him a story,

29:40.947 --> 29:41.881
and he was looking out
the window going,

29:41.948 --> 29:43.615
"I hate you! I hate you!"

29:43.682 --> 29:45.017
I hate them.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.853
What's the most boring car
on sale in Britain today?

29:46.886 --> 29:48.054
That's a good question.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.422
MAN: Brown Astons!

29:52.024 --> 29:54.626
RICHARD: Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

29:56.362 --> 29:58.197
Get out. Get out.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.572
Security, kill him.

30:08.074 --> 30:10.142
"Brown Astons" my...

30:10.209 --> 30:12.244
I tell you what, if I were
the boss of Volkswagen,

30:12.311 --> 30:13.812
I'd go and find the
man who did...

30:13.880 --> 30:15.647
What's that tall Golf called?

30:15.714 --> 30:17.383
Oh, the SV.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.886
SV, that's it.
The one that's like a Golf,

30:19.952 --> 30:22.288
but for people who have
stovepipe hats.

30:22.354 --> 30:25.324
And I would bludgeon him
with a tyre iron.

30:25.391 --> 30:28.260
"Why did you do that?
Nobody wants one!"

30:28.327 --> 30:31.964
Just to be fair, I think VW
have bigger concerns
at the moment.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.300
OK, I want to talk about
the Oxford Ring Road.

30:34.366 --> 30:37.136
I know it's miles away
from here and from
anybody watching,

30:37.203 --> 30:40.172
but the thing is, OK,
for the last two years,

30:40.239 --> 30:43.042
they've been
working on shrinking -
slightly shrinking -

30:43.109 --> 30:45.211
two roundabouts and putting
some traffic lights up.

30:45.277 --> 30:48.915
Now, do you know how much
the budget was for that job?

30:48.981 --> 30:52.051
Er... Two roundabouts,
ten grand a roundabout.
I'd say 20 grand overall.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.686
£9 million.

30:54.753 --> 30:57.023
Nine million?
-Nine million.

30:57.089 --> 31:00.626
Can you imagine
the builder's face when
he came out of that meeting?

31:02.228 --> 31:04.931
"They're gonna give me
nine million quid

31:04.997 --> 31:07.066
to shrink a couple
of roundabouts!"

31:07.133 --> 31:08.500
Well, that's why it's
taken him two years.

31:08.567 --> 31:11.137
He had to make it look like
nine million quid's worth.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.471
"Really difficult."

31:12.538 --> 31:13.705
This is not a word of a lie.

31:13.772 --> 31:18.377
£9 million will buy you
a 30,000-square-foot house,

31:18.444 --> 31:19.478
OK, like this.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.248
That is a nine-million-quid
house to build.

31:22.314 --> 31:25.651
You can have that
or two shaved roundabouts...
for your nine million quid.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.286
No. No, actually. No.

31:27.353 --> 31:30.022
Because - and this, again,
is not a word of a lie -

31:30.089 --> 31:32.124
a few months ago,
builder man -

31:32.191 --> 31:34.093
and it must have been a bet -

31:34.160 --> 31:36.963
he went back to the council
and he said,

31:36.963 --> 31:38.230
"I need another
million quid."

31:39.765 --> 31:42.534
And they paid! They paid!

31:42.601 --> 31:45.337
He probably shuffled in.
"I broke me spade."

31:46.538 --> 31:49.308
"Another million?"
"Yes, of course. Happy to."

31:49.375 --> 31:51.477
Can I be cross for a moment
with BMW?

31:51.543 --> 31:53.279
It'll be difficult
to stop you. Yes.

31:53.345 --> 31:56.082
The thing was, last year
they introduced this.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.649
They showed...
They went, "Look at that."

31:57.716 --> 31:59.585
And everybody went,
"That is fantastic!"

31:59.651 --> 32:03.990
It's an homage to the old
CSL Batmobile from '72.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.657
Everyone was going,
"When will you make it?"

32:05.724 --> 32:08.160
"We're not. It's just to show
you what we could make."

32:08.227 --> 32:09.561
RICHARD:
Why did they show us?

32:09.628 --> 32:11.097
JEREMY: Just don't do that!
-Yeah, exactly.

32:11.163 --> 32:12.631
Actually, no,
it doesn't matter,

32:12.698 --> 32:14.233
because they've come up
with something else instead.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.502
This look.
This is actually an homage

32:16.568 --> 32:19.371
to the original 2002, which is
the old car on the left,

32:19.438 --> 32:22.441
and that, I think,
actually looks pretty fab.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.410
-It does. Are they
gonna make it?
-No.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.178
Well, why show it to us,
then?

32:26.245 --> 32:28.014
"Look what we could make
but we're not."

32:28.047 --> 32:30.749
It's a good job BMW don't
run the emergency services,
isn't it?

32:30.816 --> 32:34.520
"Oh, look! You have drifted
a long way from shore there,
haven't you?

32:34.586 --> 32:36.788
We could drag you back
behind our speedboat."

32:36.855 --> 32:40.459
"Will you?"
"No. No, we just wanted you
to know that we could."

32:40.526 --> 32:42.894
What they're being
is prick-teasers.

32:43.029 --> 32:45.031
-Oh, you can't say that.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.498
I don't think
you can say that.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.267
I'm not sure
you can say that.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.036
Can you say "prick

32:50.036 --> 32:51.737
MAN: A cock-tease!

32:51.803 --> 32:54.673
"Cock
That's no different.
You've just changed the name!

32:54.740 --> 32:57.176
It's a different way
of saying "prick" or "dick".

32:57.243 --> 32:59.545
You could have said "penis
tease". It doesn't matter!

32:59.611 --> 33:02.048
Conversation Street's
taken a really bad turn.

33:03.449 --> 33:06.918
The point I'm trying to make
is BMW must stop doing that.

33:08.054 --> 33:09.621
Whatever... Whatever it was.

33:09.688 --> 33:12.891
Now, if we had
a Grand Tour medal,

33:12.958 --> 33:14.493
and we don't, but if we did,

33:14.560 --> 33:17.196
I know who the first
recipient would be.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.365
Cos we heard this amazing
story the other day.

33:19.431 --> 33:20.766
You know speed camera vans?

33:20.832 --> 33:23.169
Sit at the side of the road,
blacked out windows,

33:23.235 --> 33:26.438
civil servant sitting inside
watching YouPorn. OK?

33:26.505 --> 33:29.775
That's what it is.
Waiting for someone
to trip his camera.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.077
Now, someone, the other day,

33:31.143 --> 33:34.946
snuck up
behind the speed-camera van,

33:35.081 --> 33:37.683
quietly undid
its number plates

33:37.749 --> 33:39.585
put them on his own car

33:39.651 --> 33:42.121
and drove past
at 100 miles an hour.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.756
I mean... literally
the funniest thing ever!

33:44.823 --> 33:46.658
Well done, you, sir.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.094
Top work.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.861
-Absolutely...
JEREMY: I love that.

33:49.928 --> 33:51.563
That is top, top work.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.899
Can I talk about
the Alfa Romeo Quadrifoglio?

33:53.965 --> 33:55.167
-No.

33:55.234 --> 33:56.668
Because we've got to get
back to our film.

33:56.735 --> 33:59.171
Tonight we are on
a Grand Tour of Italy.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.839
There's James
in a Rolls-Royce,

34:00.906 --> 34:02.608
Jeremy in an Aston Martin,

34:02.674 --> 34:05.277
and me in a Dodge Hellcat
with two trucks full of tyres

34:05.344 --> 34:07.546
so I can do doughnuts
whenever I want.

34:07.613 --> 34:10.015
Yes, and we pick up
the action on day two

34:10.116 --> 34:12.818
of what was becoming,
thanks to him,

34:12.884 --> 34:15.121
the journey from hell.

34:21.127 --> 34:23.895
JEREMY: As the sun rose
over the silent,

34:23.962 --> 34:26.365
misty Italian countryside...

34:26.432 --> 34:28.634
RICHARD:
OK, let's get these out.

34:30.336 --> 34:32.938
...and Hammond
extricated his entourage

34:33.004 --> 34:34.606
from the hotel car park...

34:38.610 --> 34:41.747
...James lowered the roof
on his Rolls-Royce.

34:45.884 --> 34:47.052
-Morning.
-Morning.

34:47.153 --> 34:49.155
That is the "silent ballet".

34:49.188 --> 34:51.823
-There's nothing silent about
your lorries, Hammond.
-No, not those.

34:51.890 --> 34:54.393
That's how Rolls-Royce
themselves describe the roof

34:54.460 --> 34:56.061
going up and down,
in this, look.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.230
-"Silent ballet",
that's what they say.

34:58.297 --> 35:02.501
They also talk about
"the Dawn provides an
erotic tingle on the skin."

35:02.568 --> 35:04.236
-Whoa!
-This is all their words.

35:04.303 --> 35:07.072
-This is their words.
Yeah, this is their bumf.

35:07.173 --> 35:11.677
They also say,
"The car is a contemporary
take on the casino lifestyle.

35:11.743 --> 35:15.181
It is intended to attract...
people."

35:15.247 --> 35:17.716
-People...

35:17.783 --> 35:19.318
People who put
their seatbelts on?

35:19.385 --> 35:22.087
Exactly, people who put
their seatbelts on and off

35:22.188 --> 35:25.357
and relish both freedom
and sophistication.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.793
-Casino lifestyle.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.329
Can we go?

35:30.396 --> 35:31.797
Have you got
your seatbelt on?

35:37.869 --> 35:39.505
JEREMY: We then set off

35:39.571 --> 35:42.674
and decided to do a bit more
road testing of our cars.

35:42.741 --> 35:46.412
I began by talking about
the Aston Martin's interior.

35:49.348 --> 35:51.317
On the upside,

35:51.383 --> 35:55.221
Aston Martin
have reprogrammed
the Mercedes electronics

35:55.254 --> 36:00.359
so the warning beeps
and buzzers are now less...
Germanic.

36:00.426 --> 36:04.263
If you don't put your
seatbelt on, for example,
you get a discreet cough.

36:04.330 --> 36:07.032
A...
...rather than a klaxon

36:07.098 --> 36:09.268
and somebody shouting,
"Achtung!"

36:10.536 --> 36:12.804
On the downside
is everything else.

36:12.871 --> 36:16.508
Er... The centrepiece
of this dashboard here
looks like a...

36:16.575 --> 36:19.345
How can I put this?
...like a lady part.

36:19.411 --> 36:22.648
And then
the door lining here,
well, it's just hideous.

36:22.714 --> 36:27.353
It look like
a footballer's...
kitchen worktop.

36:27.419 --> 36:31.623
It's annoying, cos Aston
have done such a good job
with the rest of this car.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.259
I was staggered

36:33.325 --> 36:35.661
by how good it was
at the track yesterday.

36:35.727 --> 36:39.265
And yet,
they've let it all down
with this ghastly interior.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.602
In the Hellcat,
Hank J Hammondberger

36:43.669 --> 36:46.438
hadn't noticed the quality
of the fixtures and fittings.

36:46.505 --> 36:50.309
He was too busy
playing with the toys.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.778
Oh, now, look at all of this.

36:52.844 --> 36:55.581
Timers, gauges...

36:56.948 --> 36:58.484
Oh.

36:58.550 --> 37:01.653
In my performance mode
screen,

37:01.720 --> 37:03.889
I can measure G-forces,
braking distance,

37:03.955 --> 37:06.292
reactions times,
quarter-mile timer,

37:06.358 --> 37:08.660
eighth-of-a-mile timer,
lap history.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.297
It's brilliant!

37:11.297 --> 37:12.831
Irrelevant twaddle.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.935
"Irrelevant twaddle."

37:17.002 --> 37:19.405
RICHARD: Oh, I've just seen
my average MPG.

37:20.439 --> 37:21.807
What is it?

37:21.873 --> 37:23.575
6.6.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.679
Six miles to the gallon?

37:27.746 --> 37:30.316
RICHARD: I like to think
of it as a healthy appetite.

37:30.382 --> 37:34.353
How many miles to the gallon
has your Rolls-Royce
been doing, James May?

37:34.420 --> 37:37.723
15.7 in the last 48 hours.

37:37.789 --> 37:41.860
JEREMY: Mine's been doing
21 miles to the gallon.

37:41.927 --> 37:45.030
That's cos it's boring and
that's because it's brown!

37:45.096 --> 37:46.965
Oh, no.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.167
JEREMY: And, with that,
the road test ended

37:49.234 --> 37:52.237
and another day
of Hammond-based irritation
began.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.608
RICHARD:
* There'll be brown birds
over... *

37:57.876 --> 38:00.779
* Don't it make
my brown eyes brown? *

38:00.846 --> 38:02.414
It's orange!

38:03.582 --> 38:06.818
You join us
at another petrol station.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.755
I don't need any,
but guess who does.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.757
This car is excellent
for ornithologists.

38:11.823 --> 38:14.360
It's so quiet going along here,
I can listen to the birdsong.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.531
-Hello, James.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.367
Oh, for God's sake.

38:21.367 --> 38:22.768
Party button!

38:24.903 --> 38:26.605
Stop doing that!

38:27.806 --> 38:29.107
Stop it!

38:30.876 --> 38:33.111
Go away!

38:33.178 --> 38:37.983
I genuinely am worried
about the sanity
of Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.188
Many frustrating miles later,

38:43.254 --> 38:46.024
we reached the next stop
on our Grand Tour:

38:46.091 --> 38:47.793
the region around Modena,

38:47.859 --> 38:51.897
which is home
to three of the world's
greatest carmakers.

38:55.233 --> 38:57.035
And, while Hammond sped off

38:57.102 --> 39:00.839
to give his cultural take
on Lamborghini's history...

39:00.906 --> 39:04.410
Oh, my God.
That is pure filth.

39:04.476 --> 39:05.844
...James and I went off

39:05.911 --> 39:08.714
to buy
a goodbye present for him.

39:08.780 --> 39:12.951
I think scissor doors
actually make me horny.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.987
And when he'd finished
his Brian Sewell routine...

39:17.255 --> 39:18.957
...we met up to hand it over.

39:20.492 --> 39:22.728
We have had it done for you.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.329
-It's brilliant!
-I know.

39:24.430 --> 39:25.997
It's in the style, actually,

39:26.064 --> 39:30.135
of an 18th-century Italian
artist called Pompeo Batoni,

39:30.201 --> 39:31.637
who made a pretty good living

39:31.703 --> 39:35.941
out of painting visiting
Americans on the Grand Tour

39:36.007 --> 39:39.445
and making them
look like refined,

39:39.478 --> 39:41.713
cultured English gentleman.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.149
Yeah. Think of it
as a souvenir of your trip.

39:44.215 --> 39:48.086
Thank you.
Except a souvenir is what
you get at the end of a trip.

39:48.153 --> 39:51.623
-Yeah, exactly.
-Erm...

39:51.690 --> 39:54.693
JEREMY: While Hammond
struggled to get the painting
in his car

39:54.760 --> 39:56.828
for the long trip
back to England...

39:56.895 --> 39:58.530
Er...

39:58.597 --> 40:03.802
...James and I set off alone
into the glory that is Italy.

40:07.939 --> 40:11.209
Oh, my word.
Look at that view.

40:13.311 --> 40:15.947
Holy moley!

40:26.157 --> 40:27.659
That evening in Verona,

40:27.726 --> 40:30.962
we dined well at a
Michelin-starred restaurant,

40:31.029 --> 40:34.099
and then we went to see
something called Carmen,

40:34.165 --> 40:37.335
which wasn't at all
what we were expecting.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.819
He hasn't gone home, has he?

41:03.862 --> 41:06.532
The next morning,
we were up at first light

41:06.565 --> 41:08.600
to attempt another escape.

41:10.001 --> 41:12.904
James... that's his room.

41:20.445 --> 41:24.115
This has a quiet-start
facility on it, but I don't
know how it works.

41:25.350 --> 41:26.818
-Push it.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.555
I could... It's really quiet.

41:29.555 --> 41:31.256
You start...
You'll be all right.

41:33.458 --> 41:35.861
-Don't bong!

41:37.896 --> 41:39.865
That's amazing, isn't it?

41:39.931 --> 41:43.434
That's firing
80 times a second, roughly.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.604
Ah, no noise.

41:45.671 --> 41:47.272
I can just drive out of here.

41:50.942 --> 41:53.311
JEREMY: Yeah.
-Typical Aston, you see!

41:53.378 --> 41:54.479
It's broken down.

41:54.580 --> 41:56.181
You haven't got long
to get it going

41:56.247 --> 41:58.584
cos I'll be down again
in a second, changed
and ready to roll.

41:58.617 --> 41:59.685
Ya-ha!

42:05.824 --> 42:09.394
JEREMY:
Whilst Hammond was upstairs,
chiselling off his sweat...

42:10.662 --> 42:13.498
...James and I
made a run for it.

42:13.599 --> 42:16.602
And, in case he caught up
with us on the motorway,

42:16.668 --> 42:18.604
we took some precautions.

42:20.606 --> 42:24.743
This is the work of a genius.

42:24.810 --> 42:27.312
We are now protected
from Mr Hammond completely.

42:33.885 --> 42:37.789
James's head was a bit of
a problem with this plan,
but we've solved it.

42:41.459 --> 42:44.830
Don't worry if you don't
recognise me, viewers.
It's me.

42:44.896 --> 42:49.000
The question was,
would Richard Hammond
recognise him?

42:49.067 --> 42:51.670
Here comes Richard Hammond.
Just look straight ahead.

42:51.737 --> 42:53.338
Look straight ahead.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.406
And the answer was...

42:55.473 --> 42:56.842
JAMES: Not looking.

42:59.645 --> 43:01.412
Oh, God. He's waving at me!

43:04.549 --> 43:06.517
Well, he's clocked us,
hasn't he?

43:06.652 --> 43:09.988
I think you're better off
getting stone chips
than looking like that.

43:10.989 --> 43:13.659
Mayday. Mayday.
I'm disintegrating.

43:16.294 --> 43:18.263
Whilst James
unwrapped himself

43:18.329 --> 43:21.466
and Richard filled up
through his ruined present,

43:21.532 --> 43:24.469
I had another brainwave.

43:24.535 --> 43:27.405
I'm gonna lead him into
the centre of Vicenza, yeah?

43:27.472 --> 43:28.940
Yes.

43:29.007 --> 43:31.276
I've sent out a tweet,
and I put this on Facebook,

43:31.342 --> 43:35.380
saying that Richard Hammond
will be appearing
in the main square, OK?

43:35.446 --> 43:37.548
-Yes.
-So he gets out.

43:37.683 --> 43:38.717
-He's mobbed.
-Yes.

43:38.784 --> 43:41.753
-Very good. I like it.

43:41.820 --> 43:43.421
-Yes.

43:43.488 --> 43:46.391
Oh, good. Only thing is,
I've made a slight mistake.

43:46.457 --> 43:48.493
I have said here that
Richard Hammond will be -

43:48.559 --> 43:52.698
I wanted to say "appearing"
but I've put
"exhibiting himself".

43:52.698 --> 43:54.165
Well, it'll get a crowd.

43:59.370 --> 44:03.508
Back on the move,
I put my plan into action.

44:03.574 --> 44:06.812
I thought we'd turn off
the motorway here, Hammond.

44:06.878 --> 44:09.380
Vicenza's got
a doughnuting area in it.

44:09.447 --> 44:11.349
Has it?

44:11.416 --> 44:12.918
Yeah, no old statues.

44:12.984 --> 44:17.088
There's Starbucks,
McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts.

44:17.155 --> 44:19.190
I'm right, aren't I, James?

44:19.257 --> 44:22.593
I think they've got
an American football team,
haven't they, in Vicenza?

44:22.728 --> 44:25.964
They have,
the Vicenza Red Bears.

44:26.031 --> 44:27.733
OK.

44:27.733 --> 44:29.300
We'll have
a little mooch about.

44:31.369 --> 44:34.439
Soon, we were approaching
the centre of the town.

44:35.741 --> 44:37.843
I just need a crowd
big enough

44:37.909 --> 44:41.479
to keep him occupied
for 20 minutes.

44:41.546 --> 44:44.182
I don't know how many people
will have read my tweet.

44:45.483 --> 44:46.785
A couple of hundred.

44:48.754 --> 44:51.056
I was nearly right.

44:54.292 --> 44:55.794
Oh, my God.

45:00.766 --> 45:03.034
This has gone really wrong.

45:04.269 --> 45:09.775
-This has gone
so spectacularly wrong.
-Jeremy!

45:16.581 --> 45:18.116
RICHARD: Oh, my word!

45:18.183 --> 45:19.885
Hello. Is there an event on?

45:23.021 --> 45:24.823
It's Mr Hammond
you're looking for.

45:27.525 --> 45:29.394
Mr Hammond is in the Dodge.

45:31.830 --> 45:33.364
Oh, this is unnerving.

45:34.900 --> 45:37.803
Is it always this busy here?
What's going on today?

45:42.340 --> 45:45.811
Look at that, we're free,
and Hammond is stuck.

45:48.814 --> 45:50.681
Yes. Yes.

45:50.816 --> 45:51.883
We're out.

45:51.950 --> 45:54.219
Hammond is doomed!

45:54.285 --> 45:55.486
He's doomed!

45:56.988 --> 45:58.857
Leaving Hammond
in what he thought

45:58.924 --> 46:00.859
was the muscle-car capital
of Italy...

46:03.494 --> 46:06.832
They like a rev.
They do like a rev here.

46:06.898 --> 46:09.835
...James and I
headed out of town.

46:09.901 --> 46:13.004
Right, good.
Venice, 23 miles away.

46:17.708 --> 46:19.644
I think it's fair to say

46:19.710 --> 46:24.449
that this entire trip
has been a total disaster.

46:24.515 --> 46:29.720
But the Aston Martin has been
the complete opposite.

46:29.855 --> 46:33.558
It was much, much better than
I thought it was going to be
on the track.

46:33.624 --> 46:37.863
It's staggeringly civilised
and quiet on the road.

46:37.929 --> 46:41.466
It really is a superb
grand tourer,

46:41.532 --> 46:44.435
and it is achingly pretty.

46:44.502 --> 46:48.273
Especially with this
beautiful orange paintwork.

46:49.875 --> 46:53.544
JAMES: Jeremy may have been
won over by his brown Aston,

46:53.611 --> 46:57.015
but I was truly smitten
with the Rolls-Royce.

46:58.049 --> 46:59.717
What is it about
a Rolls

46:59.784 --> 47:03.955
A lot of people would say
this isn't a car-lover's car.

47:04.022 --> 47:06.357
It's not sporty,
it's not dynamic,

47:06.424 --> 47:07.993
it doesn't have modes
for you to set.

47:08.059 --> 47:09.327
You can't even change
the gears.

47:09.394 --> 47:12.297
You can only put it
in forward or reverse.

47:12.363 --> 47:16.634
And yet, I think this is a
car for people who love cars,

47:16.701 --> 47:20.205
because it gives you
an entirely different
driving experience.

47:20.271 --> 47:23.208
There is no other car that's
quite like a Rolls-Royce,

47:23.274 --> 47:26.011
no other car that cossets you
in the same way.

47:26.077 --> 47:29.714
This is a car
that is kind to you.

47:29.780 --> 47:33.218
I think it is actually
impossible to be unhappy
if you're driving this car.

47:33.284 --> 47:35.020
And look at what
I've had to put up with:

47:35.086 --> 47:36.922
Richard Hammond
and Richard Hammond,

47:36.922 --> 47:38.356
Richard Hammond,
the Dodge Hellcat,

47:38.423 --> 47:41.927
Richard Hammond,
the Dodge Hellcat,
and I'm still happy.

47:44.595 --> 47:48.166
JEREMY:
As we arrived in Venice,
we were in good spirits.

47:50.035 --> 47:51.169
And, the next morning,

47:51.236 --> 47:53.038
we did
what all our predecessors

47:53.104 --> 47:55.573
on the Grand Tour
would have done.

47:55.640 --> 47:58.309
We took in the sights
from the water.

48:01.746 --> 48:03.248
It's so nice without Hammond.

48:04.515 --> 48:05.984
Dinner last night...

48:06.051 --> 48:09.120
Nice to order food
without somebody going,
"Have you got any chips?"

48:09.187 --> 48:12.557
Yeah. "Where's the ketchup?"

48:12.623 --> 48:15.826
JEREMY: He is never,
ever going to get out of
that square. I mean never.

48:15.961 --> 48:18.997
JAMES: I assume he's been
crushed to death by now,
or torn apart.

48:21.132 --> 48:22.600
Have you seen that?

48:22.667 --> 48:24.369
-Yeah.
-What a moron.

48:24.435 --> 48:27.672
JAMES: An inappropriate
brown powerboat.

48:27.738 --> 48:29.074
JEREMY: Orange.

48:29.140 --> 48:31.442
Is that allowed round here?
I'm surprised, actually.

48:33.011 --> 48:35.080
Lads!

48:35.146 --> 48:38.883
JAMES: What a yob.
JEREMY: I thought
his Hellcat was bad.

48:38.984 --> 48:40.618
Hammond, no.

48:43.221 --> 48:45.590
That's really inappropriate,
Hammond. Don't do that.

48:45.656 --> 48:46.824
This is very wobbly.

48:46.891 --> 48:49.494
JEREMY: Don't...
Don't do that, Hammond.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.129
Yeah!

48:51.196 --> 48:53.131
Who's hungry?
Who's for doughnuts?

48:53.198 --> 48:54.699
Hammond, stop it!

48:54.765 --> 48:56.567
-Whoa!

48:56.634 --> 48:59.404
Yah! Water doughnut!

48:59.470 --> 49:00.671
Stop it!

49:07.812 --> 49:10.348
JEREMY: Hammond! Hammond!

49:15.620 --> 49:17.122
What?

49:18.756 --> 49:21.026
Grand Tour. We can
do it again next year.

49:21.092 --> 49:23.228
Next year?
Do it again next year?

49:25.796 --> 49:28.499
Not only
did you knock us into

49:28.566 --> 49:31.602
the sewage-infested waters
of Venice...

49:31.669 --> 49:34.772
you cut the present
we gave you in half.

49:34.839 --> 49:36.841
No, hang on a minute.
No, it was only like

49:36.907 --> 49:39.477
a two-piece jigsaw puzzle, and
I put it back together again.

49:39.544 --> 49:41.946
Look, there it is.
See? Perfect.

49:42.047 --> 49:43.181
-Yes.

49:43.248 --> 49:47.285
Art galleries
do not saw artworks in half

49:47.352 --> 49:49.454
just to get them
up the stairs, you moron.

49:49.520 --> 49:51.422
Anyway, listen,
before we move on,

49:51.489 --> 49:53.458
can I just say something
about that Aston Martin?

49:53.524 --> 49:56.261
Not to wind you two up.
I genuinely mean this.

49:56.327 --> 49:57.495
It's an amazing car.

49:57.562 --> 49:59.497
I know the steering wheel
is square.

49:59.564 --> 50:00.931
-And it was brown.
-Yes.

50:01.066 --> 50:03.068
And I know the interior
wasn't very nice,

50:03.134 --> 50:04.735
but, genuinely,
it's affected me.

50:04.802 --> 50:07.972
It's been living up here
ever since I got back.

50:08.039 --> 50:09.440
And talking of up here,

50:09.507 --> 50:13.544
it's now time to play
Celebrity Brain Crash.

50:20.518 --> 50:23.421
Yes, it's time
for a top celebrity

50:23.488 --> 50:26.991
to try their hand at our
fearsome test of skill,

50:27.058 --> 50:29.294
co-ordination
and observation.

50:29.360 --> 50:32.029
Now, so far,
I should explain,

50:32.097 --> 50:35.333
no celebrity has actually
made it to the tent.

50:35.400 --> 50:36.734
-No, they've all died.

50:36.801 --> 50:40.271
Yes, but our fingers
are crossed for this week,

50:40.338 --> 50:43.274
because our guest
is a huge star.

50:43.341 --> 50:46.344
You'll have seen him
in Mission Impossible,

50:46.411 --> 50:50.515
Star Trek,
Shaun Of The Dead,Hot Fuzz,

50:50.581 --> 50:53.251
and he's here to talk about
his new movie -

50:53.318 --> 50:55.320
Spielberg movie -
Ready Player One .

50:55.386 --> 50:58.456
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've got Simon Pegg!

51:02.026 --> 51:04.329
And there he is.

51:04.395 --> 51:07.365
There he is,
ladies and gentlemen,
with his Cornetto.

51:07.432 --> 51:08.899
RICHARD: Always a Cornetto.

51:08.966 --> 51:12.370
JEREMY: He's battled aliens,
he's battled zombies,

51:12.437 --> 51:14.038
he should have
no problem at all

51:14.139 --> 51:16.474
with a short stroll through
this pretty little town.

51:16.541 --> 51:18.976
Of all his films,
it's Paul that I like best.

51:19.043 --> 51:22.180
-I think that stands out.
- Paul was the forerunner
of Ted, really.

51:22.247 --> 51:24.149
-It was.
-It was first. It came first.

51:24.215 --> 51:27.518
Hot Fuzz .
It's Hot Fuzz for me, just
because of the fight scenes.

51:27.585 --> 51:29.587
RICHARD: There he is.
He's on the bridge.

51:29.654 --> 51:32.423
-It looks like he's being
hassled by seagulls.

51:32.490 --> 51:34.925
They're after his Cornetto,
I think.

51:34.992 --> 51:36.461
Yeah, they're after his...
Oh!

51:38.363 --> 51:40.765
-Oh!

51:40.831 --> 51:42.333
Oh, God.

51:42.400 --> 51:44.169
There's literally
nothing we can do.

51:44.169 --> 51:45.570
We're gonna get a reputation.

51:47.172 --> 51:48.439
Does that mean
he's not coming on then?

51:48.506 --> 51:50.408
-Well, James...

51:50.475 --> 51:54.379
...he fell into the harbour,
and the icy North Sea waters
are now filling his lungs.

51:54.445 --> 51:56.781
It's a no.
He's not coming on.

51:56.847 --> 51:58.416
Oh, God...

52:00.251 --> 52:02.420
Well, look, I...

52:02.487 --> 52:05.190
-Oh.
-I anticipated
something like this.

52:05.256 --> 52:06.757
-Yes.

52:06.824 --> 52:09.960
And so I prepared something else
we can do to fill the time.

52:10.027 --> 52:16.000
It's this. You know Google
have been trying to build
a self

52:16.066 --> 52:17.568
For seven years
they've been at it.

52:17.635 --> 52:20.271
We've got a picture of it.
It's absolutely hideous.

52:20.338 --> 52:22.540
I was thinking,
"Well, how hard can it be?"

52:22.607 --> 52:24.309
RICHARD: Oh, God.

52:24.375 --> 52:26.344
Ten days ago I thought,
"I'll give it a bash," okay?

52:26.411 --> 52:28.045
And I've already finished it.

52:28.112 --> 52:29.414
-Yes, it's here.

52:29.480 --> 52:30.615
-Yes, it's here.

52:30.681 --> 52:32.483
Let's bring it out.
It's phone-operated.

52:32.550 --> 52:34.552
-So, erm...
Hang on. Just set....

52:34.619 --> 52:37.121
No, here it comes.
Right, forwards.

52:37.222 --> 52:38.223
Forwards.

52:38.256 --> 52:39.657
Please try not
to be distracted

52:39.724 --> 52:43.428
by the harrowing scenes...
of...

52:43.494 --> 52:46.397
Left, left. Straight.

52:46.464 --> 52:49.734
...the harrowing scenes
of Simon's lifeless corpse

52:49.800 --> 52:52.102
being fished
from the harbour.

52:52.237 --> 52:54.239
I know that's upsetting
for some people.

52:54.305 --> 52:57.308
Right, we need to make
a bit of a a hole
in the crowd back here,

52:57.375 --> 52:59.477
cos I'm gonna bring it
into the tent studio

52:59.544 --> 53:01.512
so you can see
how brilliant I've been.

53:01.579 --> 53:03.348
-Forwards.

53:03.414 --> 53:06.251
RICHARD: Really?
-That is brilliant!

53:06.284 --> 53:08.253
-It's...
-Cheer, everybody.

53:09.820 --> 53:12.990
Left. Left. Left.

53:13.057 --> 53:15.260
-It's hideous!
-Left. Forwards.

53:16.594 --> 53:20.731
-It's... So, hold on.
-Stop. Stop.

53:20.798 --> 53:22.967
It's not brilliant.
It's hideous, is what it is.

53:23.033 --> 53:24.302
How can you say it's hideous?

53:24.369 --> 53:26.771
I've copied Google's
styling completely.

53:26.837 --> 53:30.275
Is that a septic tank?

53:30.275 --> 53:31.842
-Yes, it is.

53:31.909 --> 53:35.045
Cut in half, and then
I've mounted on the top

53:35.112 --> 53:36.414
this chaise longue,

53:36.481 --> 53:38.783
so the owner can recline
in great comfort.

53:38.849 --> 53:41.619
Yeah, yeah.
How does it actually work?

53:41.686 --> 53:42.587
Brilliantly.

53:42.653 --> 53:44.855
Down here,
a very small little camera.

53:44.922 --> 53:49.294
That feeds a view of the road
ahead to the system inside.

53:49.360 --> 53:51.496
-Well, there's a bonnet here.

53:51.562 --> 53:54.198
Come round, I'll show you
the... the gubbins. Ready?

53:54.299 --> 53:56.501
There it is.

53:56.567 --> 53:58.703
RICHARD:
Well, it's just a man!

53:58.769 --> 54:00.738
-It's just a man in there!
-It isn't.

54:01.939 --> 54:02.740
It is!

54:06.311 --> 54:08.313
No. No.

54:10.681 --> 54:13.684
It's not just a man.
This is a Romanian man.

54:15.019 --> 54:18.323
I am providing employment
for newcomers to our country.

54:18.356 --> 54:20.458
-Oh, God.

54:20.525 --> 54:22.493
Think about it. Google, yes?

54:22.560 --> 54:26.464
Google, they use electronics
to take away the work
of a man.

54:26.531 --> 54:29.567
This gives him a job,
it gives him dignity.

54:29.634 --> 54:32.136
-Yes, dignity.

54:32.202 --> 54:33.738
It's a bit feudal, isn't it?

54:33.804 --> 54:36.574
It's a bit brilliant
is what it is.
Let me close the bonnet.

54:36.641 --> 54:38.343
I'm gonna go for
my first-ever drive.

54:38.376 --> 54:40.177
I'll go to t'foot
of our stairs here,

54:40.244 --> 54:42.146
which is a Yorkshire
expression.

54:42.212 --> 54:45.850
The great thing is,
it's so easy to get in
and out of, you know.

54:45.916 --> 54:47.117
Look, there I am.

54:48.886 --> 54:52.423
-Now I don't need the phone.
I can use my speaking tube.
-Oh, God!

54:53.458 --> 54:54.692
There's a man in there!

54:54.759 --> 54:57.027
What's Romanian
for "backwards"?

54:57.094 --> 54:58.496
Înapoi, I think.

54:58.563 --> 55:01.198
Înapoi. It is, obviously.
It's bilingual.

55:01.265 --> 55:02.700
This is evil!

55:02.767 --> 55:05.603
Google hasn't made it work,
I have.

55:05.670 --> 55:07.938
Îna... Backwards.
I'll just stick to English.

55:08.005 --> 55:09.840
Backwards. Backwards.

55:11.275 --> 55:13.511
Thank you so much.

55:13.578 --> 55:16.947
British engineering,
ladies and gentlemen,

55:17.014 --> 55:19.484
with Romanian parts.

55:19.550 --> 55:22.219
What a combination that is.

55:22.286 --> 55:24.021
Shit! Ah, my head!

55:29.193 --> 55:30.828
Yep. Whatever.

55:32.430 --> 55:36.000
-Anyway, I'm glad he's gone.
-So am I.

55:36.066 --> 55:39.637
No, I'm particularly glad
because of what's
coming up next.

55:39.704 --> 55:42.673
Oh, yes! Yes. Now, right at
the beginning of this series,

55:42.740 --> 55:46.110
Jeremy Clarkson said,
when we were at a race track
in Portugal -

55:46.176 --> 55:48.145
and he said it
on the television -

55:48.212 --> 55:50.948
that if his McLaren P1
wasn't faster

55:51.015 --> 55:54.485
than Hammond's Porsche 918
or my Ferrari The Ferrari,

55:54.552 --> 55:56.320
we could
knock his house down.

55:56.421 --> 55:57.888
Well, it wasn't,

55:57.955 --> 56:01.258
so, one weekend when
Jeremy was away, we...

56:01.325 --> 56:02.893
Well, roll the tape.

56:04.429 --> 56:05.963
JAMES: This is it,

56:06.030 --> 56:10.735
200 years old and built from
beautiful Cotswold stone.

56:10.801 --> 56:12.670
Now, I want to make it
absolutely clear

56:12.737 --> 56:15.873
that this is
Jeremy Clarkson's
actual house.

56:15.940 --> 56:18.776
Yeah, it really is.
I'd swear to my children's
lives on that.

56:18.843 --> 56:21.846
It's Jeremy's house.
He bought it when he
fell in love with the view.

56:21.912 --> 56:23.614
It is a lovely view,
actually.

56:23.681 --> 56:26.684
It is. It'll be even better
soon, without a house in it.

56:29.153 --> 56:31.556
RICHARD: Our plan
was to smash the place down

56:31.622 --> 56:34.324
with some big
demolition equipment.

56:34.459 --> 56:35.760
But there was a problem.

56:40.164 --> 56:43.133
In this country,
you can't knock a house down

56:43.200 --> 56:46.671
if the council find evidence
of bats living in it.

56:46.737 --> 56:48.639
Well, they did,
and now we've been told

56:48.706 --> 56:51.809
we've got to take the roof
off, quietly and by hand,

56:51.876 --> 56:55.379
to give the bats the chance
to go and live elsewhere.

56:55.480 --> 56:58.949
James, I can't help but
notice I am doing
all of the work here.

56:59.016 --> 57:01.619
JAMES: Yeah, you're gonna
have to. I don't like it.

57:01.686 --> 57:05.790
RICHARD: It's just a ladder!
It's a simple enough thing
to operate. Climb it!

57:05.856 --> 57:08.526
Not if you're me, it's not.
How many bats are there?

57:08.593 --> 57:09.594
-One.

57:09.660 --> 57:11.762
-Yes, a bat.
-Just kill it.

57:11.829 --> 57:13.498
We'll go to prison, mate.
We can't.

57:13.531 --> 57:15.800
Just because that little
winged-mouse bastard

57:15.866 --> 57:18.302
is hanging upside down in there,
feeling smug with himself

57:18.368 --> 57:20.705
cos I'm up this ladder, we
can't knock the house down?

57:20.771 --> 57:23.708
We've got to do it,
no choice, so get up here
and get on with it.

57:23.774 --> 57:26.611
Hammond, I hate...
I hate heights.
You know I do.

57:26.677 --> 57:28.713
I hate ladders, I hate bats.

57:30.380 --> 57:31.649
RICHARD: Many hours later,

57:31.716 --> 57:35.019
and with no help at all
from Spider-Man,

57:35.085 --> 57:39.023
the roof was finally off
and the bat was free to move.

57:39.089 --> 57:40.124
But would it?

57:40.190 --> 57:42.059
Why doesn't it go and live
in there?

57:42.126 --> 57:44.394
Because, let's be honest,
that's perfect
if you're a bat.

57:44.529 --> 57:48.833
Yeah, well, it might, but
it's got to decide to do so.

57:48.899 --> 57:51.435
-Yes, James.

57:51.536 --> 57:55.806
Why don't you go and stand
in that barn and squeak in
a sultry and erotic manner?

57:58.609 --> 58:00.911
RICHARD: That night,
Spider-Man stood in the barn,

58:00.978 --> 58:03.748
squeaking in a sultry
and erotic manner...

58:05.750 --> 58:08.919
...and the bat
eventually succumbed.

58:08.986 --> 58:11.722
So, the next morning,
we were ready to go.

58:27.838 --> 58:31.141
This thing really works!
This rocks!

58:31.208 --> 58:32.409
Oh, my word!

58:32.476 --> 58:35.880
At this rate, we'd be done
and dusted in no time.

58:35.946 --> 58:39.283
However, my finickity
colleague had an issue.

58:40.851 --> 58:42.286
-Hammond!

58:42.352 --> 58:43.854
-Stop!

58:43.921 --> 58:44.755
Stop!

58:44.822 --> 58:46.323
You don't just smash it
to pieces.

58:46.390 --> 58:49.059
You're supposed to
dismantle it and leave it
in neat piles.

58:49.126 --> 58:51.729
It's got to be tidied up.
You can't leave it like that.

58:51.796 --> 58:54.431
It's actually quicker
if you do it methodically.

58:54.498 --> 58:56.266
Oh, God.
Only you would say that!

58:56.333 --> 58:58.603
You want neat piles of bits
that can be carted away.

58:58.636 --> 59:01.105
You need to work on that bit
and that bit to start with,

59:01.171 --> 59:02.940
then the rest
falls neatly into a heap.

59:03.007 --> 59:05.109
How can you make
even this boring?

59:05.175 --> 59:07.477
It's not boring. It's the
way... I've watched it done.

59:07.612 --> 59:10.314
That's how you do it.
You don't just smash it.
I'll do it.

59:11.682 --> 59:14.952
James then commandeered
my machine...

59:15.019 --> 59:17.922
so I got another one
and carried on regardless.

59:19.423 --> 59:20.725
And bang!

59:26.263 --> 59:28.498
JAMES: Ah! I've got it!

59:33.470 --> 59:36.340
JAMES: Oh, it's like winning
one of those things
at the fair.

59:36.406 --> 59:40.077
RICHARD:
Thanks to me, at least,
progress was being made.

59:40.144 --> 59:40.945
However...

59:41.011 --> 59:44.148
-I'm stuck on something.

59:47.284 --> 59:53.123
Oh! Oh, I've broken
my digger. Oh, dear.

59:53.190 --> 59:56.961
With me out of action
and James achieving nothing,

59:57.027 --> 59:58.963
a new approach was needed.

59:59.029 --> 1:00:01.131
But first,
we had to clear the site

1:00:01.198 --> 1:00:03.768
of Jeremy's
most treasured possessions.

1:00:05.069 --> 1:00:05.936
Shakira.

1:00:07.171 --> 1:00:08.038
Shakira.

1:00:09.606 --> 1:00:10.675
Shakira.

1:00:14.144 --> 1:00:15.913
Oh!

1:00:15.980 --> 1:00:19.283
That is a... strong image.

1:00:19.349 --> 1:00:23.287
It's a tiny doll with pins
in it, and your face.

1:00:26.691 --> 1:00:30.027
Look, this is his photo
album. It's probably
really precious.

1:00:31.595 --> 1:00:33.363
-Oh, it's a bit disturbing.

1:00:37.935 --> 1:00:40.470
-They're all of me.
-Yep.

1:00:40.537 --> 1:00:45.442
JAMES: At this point, we
decided not to clear the site
of his treasured possessions

1:00:45.509 --> 1:00:47.812
and moved swiftly to plan B.

1:00:48.846 --> 1:00:51.148
Short ceremony,
say a few words?

1:00:51.215 --> 1:00:52.249
Nah.

1:01:12.870 --> 1:01:14.939
RICHARD: That...
JAMES: That got it.

1:01:25.115 --> 1:01:26.383
Done.

1:01:29.219 --> 1:01:30.821
So, let's just get this
straight.

1:01:31.822 --> 1:01:34.091
You blew up...

1:01:34.158 --> 1:01:36.326
that picture of me
on the horse?

1:01:36.393 --> 1:01:37.594
-Yep.
-Yep.

1:01:37.661 --> 1:01:39.764
-Yep.

1:01:39.797 --> 1:01:43.433
And on that terrible
disappointment, it's time to
end. Thanks for watching.

1:01:43.500 --> 1:01:44.634
See you next week.

1:01:44.769 --> 1:01:46.236
-Good night!

1:01:47.772 --> 1:01:49.840
