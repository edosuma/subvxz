11:45 check-in, and Alpha One is secure.

00:08.483 --> 00:11.886
Congratulations. You get to
check on it again in 15 minutes.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.521
I'm going 10-7.

Cameras just crashed.

00:27.502 --> 00:28.869
They're rebooting.

00:28.904 --> 00:30.304
I'm initiating lockdown protocol.

00:30.338 --> 00:31.372
On my way to Alpha One.

00:35.477 --> 00:37.044
Okay.

00:40.982 --> 00:43.284
Alpha One is secure.

00:43.318 --> 00:44.552
Copy.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.420
We're back online.

00:46.454 --> 00:47.988
Points of entry are secure.

00:48.023 --> 00:50.991
I'm gonna run diagnostics
on the power system.

00:59.534 --> 01:00.935
We have a breach.

01:26.161 --> 01:27.995
What is this?

01:28.029 --> 01:29.697
Did somebody die?

01:29.731 --> 01:32.466
Wow, Eddie. Such a hopeless romantic.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.968
Sam's date just sent them.

01:34.002 --> 01:35.936
I'm intrigued by his flower choices.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.205
Did you know gladiolas
symbolize faithfulness?

01:38.240 --> 01:39.357
I didn't even know you were dating.

01:39.392 --> 01:41.141
Well, I wasn't. It just kind of happened.

01:41.176 --> 01:42.776
Really? So, who is he?

01:42.811 --> 01:44.211
His name's Troy. Troy Harper.

01:44.246 --> 01:46.180
I met him while I was jogging
at Lake Hollywood.

01:46.214 --> 01:48.215
Oh. How many times have you gone out?

01:48.250 --> 01:50.451
Just once, last night.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.720
I know. I was nervous. It's the
first time I've been on a date

01:52.754 --> 01:54.221
since I left rehab.

01:54.256 --> 01:56.724
But you know what? I had an amazing time,

01:56.758 --> 01:58.359
and apparently, the feeling was mutual.

01:58.393 --> 02:00.661
So, these flowers after one date?

02:00.695 --> 02:03.330
Isn't that a little, um... stalker-y?

02:03.365 --> 02:04.298
Try thoughtful.

02:04.332 --> 02:05.966
- Considerate.
- Chivalrous?

02:06.001 --> 02:09.303
Okay, look, maybe it's me... cynical.

02:09.336 --> 02:11.205
Cortana, can you remind me
to call Troy Harper

02:11.239 --> 02:12.573
today at 3:00 P.M.?

02:12.607 --> 02:15.542
Okay, Sam. I'll remind you.

02:15.577 --> 02:16.577
Why don't you just call him now?

02:16.611 --> 02:19.913
Oh, well, he said that he was gonna
be tied up until early afternoon,

02:19.948 --> 02:22.216
and also, I don't want to seem overeager.

02:25.353 --> 02:26.520
Hey, uh...

02:26.554 --> 02:28.055
what do you know about this guy,

02:28.089 --> 02:30.157
aside from the fact
that she met him jogging?

02:30.191 --> 02:31.392
I know as much as you do.

02:34.396 --> 02:35.396
Berto.

02:35.430 --> 02:37.998
See what you can find out
about this Troy Harper.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.401
I mean, Sam's a celebrity,
she's vulnerable.

02:40.435 --> 02:42.102
I just want to make sure that he's legit.

02:42.137 --> 02:43.537
- On it.
- Okay.

02:49.744 --> 02:50.844
Paul?

02:52.447 --> 02:54.715
Hi! What are you doing here?

02:54.749 --> 02:56.617
Sam, it's great to see you.

02:56.651 --> 02:58.619
Eddie. Oh, Eddie.

02:58.653 --> 02:59.620
This is Paul Dorsey.

02:59.654 --> 03:01.555
He helped me buy art
when I had money to burn,

03:01.589 --> 03:03.504
and then when I didn't,
he helped me hock my Hockney.

03:03.538 --> 03:04.522
Hey.

03:04.557 --> 03:07.027
What can we do for you, Mr. Dorsey?

03:07.062 --> 03:09.363
I need your help.

03:09.397 --> 03:10.597
Desperately.

03:12.767 --> 03:14.702
My auction house is minor

03:14.736 --> 03:16.403
compared to Sotheby's and Christie's,

03:16.438 --> 03:17.538
but we're growing.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.540
In fact, uh, the Kaminsky estate

03:19.574 --> 03:21.709
chose us to auction

03:21.743 --> 03:23.544
one of Kaminsky's most important works.

03:23.578 --> 03:24.645
Kaminsky?

03:24.679 --> 03:25.750
Even I've heard of him.

03:25.785 --> 03:27.481
Its valued at $50 million.

03:27.515 --> 03:30.484
A sale like this
could take us to the next level.

03:30.518 --> 03:32.119
That's great, Paul.

03:32.153 --> 03:33.987
So, what's the problem?

03:34.022 --> 03:35.856
Kill circuit 47.

03:39.194 --> 03:40.361
It's a projection.

03:40.395 --> 03:43.497
Yep, from a miniature projector
hidden inside that camera.

03:43.531 --> 03:45.132
So, the real painting was stolen?

03:45.166 --> 03:46.232
Last night.

03:46.266 --> 03:48.402
Somebody hacked into our power system

03:48.436 --> 03:49.570
and crashed the cameras.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.572
They were in and out in 30 seconds.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.674
So, they used the projector to buy time

03:53.708 --> 03:55.309
before the theft was discovered?

03:55.343 --> 03:57.511
Exactly, and that painting

03:57.545 --> 03:59.480
is up for auction in three days.

03:59.514 --> 04:01.515
- Oh, my God, Paul.
- Yeah, I know.

04:01.549 --> 04:04.585
And now it's been taken while in my care.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.587
I mean, how do I tell the estate

04:06.621 --> 04:09.156
that their masterpiece was stolen?

04:09.190 --> 04:10.247
This is...

04:10.282 --> 04:11.759
This is everything I've ever worked for.

04:11.793 --> 04:14.194
It's my reputation. This is it for me.

04:14.229 --> 04:15.863
Unless we get the painting back.

04:15.897 --> 04:19.199
In 72 hours without anyone
knowing that it was ever taken.

04:19.233 --> 04:20.934
Do you think that's even possible?

04:20.969 --> 04:22.636
Look, we can't make any promises,

04:22.670 --> 04:24.671
but we'll give it a try.

04:24.706 --> 04:25.636
Thank you.

04:25.670 --> 04:27.174
I mean, as long as all of this

04:27.208 --> 04:28.509
is kept secret.

04:28.543 --> 04:30.511
Of course.

04:30.545 --> 04:32.646
You have any idea how long that
fake camera has been up there?

04:32.680 --> 04:35.816
Probably since I upgraded
the security system

04:35.850 --> 04:37.384
before we installed the painting.

04:37.419 --> 04:38.755
That was about two weeks ago.

04:38.790 --> 04:40.954
So, the thief's been planning it
at least that long.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.656
I'm gonna need names
of everybody involved

04:42.690 --> 04:44.625
- in that upgrade.
- I can get you those.

04:44.659 --> 04:45.692
Do you have surveillance video

04:45.727 --> 04:47.027
from when that work was done?

04:47.061 --> 04:48.896
No. The cameras were disabled

04:48.930 --> 04:50.697
during the security upgrade.

04:50.732 --> 04:52.833
How did the thief get in and out?

04:52.867 --> 04:54.635
They cut the middle of the door out

04:54.669 --> 04:57.155
so they wouldn't trigger the sensors.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.552
The glass. The projector.

05:00.586 --> 05:03.510
Eddie, what if this M.O.
is unique to the thief?

05:03.545 --> 05:04.912
It could help us identify him.

05:04.946 --> 05:06.980
We used an FBI consultant
on "Hot Suspect"

05:07.015 --> 05:08.215
who was an expert in art theft.

05:08.249 --> 05:09.483
I could run it past him.

05:09.517 --> 05:10.451
Talking to an FBI agent

05:10.485 --> 05:12.219
is not the best way
to keep this a secret.

05:12.253 --> 05:13.654
I wholeheartedly agree.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.222
Uh, he can't know about this.

05:15.256 --> 05:17.357
I will make sure that he doesn't.

05:17.392 --> 05:19.193
I got this, Paul. Trust me.

05:26.434 --> 05:29.604
I don't see any fingerprints,
not that I'd expect to.

05:30.071 --> 05:32.673
Has anyone touched this glass?

05:32.707 --> 05:33.740
No.

05:33.775 --> 05:35.609
Good, because the thief handled it,

05:35.643 --> 05:38.245
which means he may have left his scent.

05:38.279 --> 05:39.904
Are you saying you can actually

05:39.938 --> 05:41.849
track the thief off his scent?

05:41.883 --> 05:44.885
Well, I can't, but maybe
my friend Zeus can.

05:47.121 --> 05:48.789
Oh, it don't look like much,

05:48.823 --> 05:50.162
but this here is the latest

05:50.197 --> 05:51.892
in portable electronic scent detection.

05:51.926 --> 05:54.428
It can pick up organic
and chemical compounds

05:54.462 --> 05:55.863
down to two parts per billion.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.532
Just think of it as a digital bloodhound.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.567
You could actually find him with that?

06:00.602 --> 06:04.204
I once tracked a guy through
downtown L.A. with this thing.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.406
So, how are we looking, Zeus?

06:06.441 --> 06:08.642
Not getting enough to go off of here.

06:08.676 --> 06:09.910
Maybe if he had more contact

06:09.944 --> 06:11.745
or if I had some clothes that he wore...

06:11.779 --> 06:13.747
So, it's not gonna work.

06:13.781 --> 06:15.382
You know, we can't track the thief,

06:15.416 --> 06:17.384
but what if we can track the painting?

06:27.529 --> 06:29.229
Is it giving you something
strong enough to follow?

06:29.264 --> 06:30.664
Oh, yeah.

06:30.698 --> 06:31.798
Compounds from the canvas,

06:31.833 --> 06:34.668
aromatics from the paint
transferred to the frame...

06:34.702 --> 06:36.603
it's giving us a unique scent profile.

06:36.638 --> 06:38.173
Now let's see where it takes us.

06:39.140 --> 06:40.677
- I'll keep you posted.
- Okay.

06:43.511 --> 06:45.412
So, your thief used a projector to fake

06:45.446 --> 06:46.813
that a painting was still on a wall?

06:46.848 --> 06:47.814
Exactly.

06:47.849 --> 06:49.583
Well, I know
you're with the art crime unit,

06:49.617 --> 06:52.286
so I figured you would know of
some real cases like that.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.656
Mm, I don't. It actually
sounds kind of far-fetched.

06:55.690 --> 06:56.835
Well, it is a movie script.

06:56.869 --> 06:59.092
I think they're taking
some creative license.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.662
Especially if they're casting
you to play an art thief.

07:01.696 --> 07:03.664
Hey, I played a cop. Come on.

07:03.698 --> 07:05.065
I could play a criminal.

07:05.099 --> 07:07.768
You know, I just... I need to do
some major research, you know?

07:07.802 --> 07:12.139
Study some thieves,
immerse myself in thievery.

07:12.173 --> 07:14.007
Do you know of anyone that
could pull off a job like that,

07:14.042 --> 07:15.943
like the one in the script?

07:15.977 --> 07:17.878
There are maybe a handful of guys.

07:17.912 --> 07:19.846
You think you could
get me some info on them?

07:19.881 --> 07:22.349
You know, their backgrounds, their M.O.s?

07:22.383 --> 07:25.552
Sam, you're not working a case
here, are you?

07:25.587 --> 07:27.621
Mark. Don't you think
if a painting was stolen,

07:27.655 --> 07:29.474
you would've heard about that?

07:30.358 --> 07:31.851
What do you say?

07:32.760 --> 07:34.895
I'll see what I can do.

07:35.930 --> 07:37.898
We're two blocks out now.

07:37.932 --> 07:39.533
Signal's getting weaker,

07:39.567 --> 07:42.569
but your thief definitely took
the painting down this street.

07:42.604 --> 07:43.804
Yeah, well, I can see why...

07:43.838 --> 07:46.740
no security cameras, light traffic.

07:46.774 --> 07:48.141
It's an ideal escape route.

07:51.579 --> 07:54.514
Hey, Berto. Let me guess. Uh, Troy
Harper has a criminal record.

07:54.549 --> 07:55.816
Not even a parking ticket.

07:55.850 --> 07:56.883
Then he's married?

07:56.918 --> 07:58.018
Nope. Single.

07:58.052 --> 07:59.079
What does he do for a living?

07:59.113 --> 08:01.355
- He's a doctor.
- What kind of doctor?

08:01.389 --> 08:03.690
A cancer researcher. Top in his field.

08:03.725 --> 08:05.759
Before that, he was
an Olympic javelin-thrower

08:05.793 --> 08:08.362
and a fashion model in Italy.

08:08.396 --> 08:09.730
I just sent you his picture.

08:14.936 --> 08:16.169
Wow.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.438
This guy's clean, bordering on pure.

08:18.473 --> 08:20.007
Well, you know what? That's good news.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.376
I'm happy for Sam.
We can all rest easy now.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.011
I was resting easy a while ago.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.697
Yeah, okay.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.115
Checking on Sam's men now?

08:28.149 --> 08:29.883
- Just looking out for her.
- Mm-hmm.

08:29.917 --> 08:31.918
Come on, you know there's
some real creeps out there.

08:31.953 --> 08:34.441
Ooh. Especially them doctors.

08:34.475 --> 08:35.789
All right, end of the line.

08:35.823 --> 08:37.289
The scent stops right here.

08:37.325 --> 08:38.457
So, what? The, uh...

08:38.493 --> 08:40.927
the thief got in a car that
was parked here and took off?

08:40.962 --> 08:42.429
Oh, we could bang on some doors,

08:42.462 --> 08:43.929
see if anybody saw him or his car.

08:43.965 --> 08:45.365
Well, we may not have to.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.533
There's no cameras on the street,

08:46.567 --> 08:49.102
but there's definitely one in that ATM.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.171
Free-standing ones
are easier to get into.

08:53.274 --> 08:55.575
Whoever he is,
he was in that parking spot

08:55.610 --> 08:56.777
across the street.

08:59.113 --> 09:00.747
Wait. There. Stop.

09:03.117 --> 09:04.618
That's him!

09:04.652 --> 09:05.686
That's not a him.

09:07.822 --> 09:08.855
It's a her.

09:08.890 --> 09:10.957
Yeah. There's not enough detail
to see her face.

09:10.992 --> 09:11.958
The car doesn't help, either.

09:11.993 --> 09:13.026
Can't see the license plate
from this angle.

09:13.061 --> 09:15.262
Plus it's a Civic.
There's lots of those around.

09:15.296 --> 09:18.298
Wait, a Civic.
I just saw something about that.

09:18.332 --> 09:20.901
My FBI guy, he gave me
M.O.s and profiles on...

09:20.935 --> 09:23.546
on six thieves he thought
could pull off this heist.

09:24.505 --> 09:25.972
Here it is.

09:26.007 --> 09:28.642
"The suspect always used
a Civic as a getaway car

09:28.676 --> 09:30.744
because it's common
and easily blends in."

09:30.778 --> 09:32.179
I'm sure lots of criminals use them.

09:32.213 --> 09:33.980
Yeah, but Garrett Larson,

09:34.015 --> 09:36.349
he also did a heist where
he cut through a glass door.

09:36.384 --> 09:38.667
Well, it seems like we're looking
for a woman now. That's a guy.

09:38.702 --> 09:40.587
It also says he
passed away a few years ago.

09:40.621 --> 09:45.292
But according to this,
Larson had a daughter,

09:45.326 --> 09:48.662
and she was a person of interest
in his last theft.

09:48.696 --> 09:50.831
Maybe she took over the family business.

09:54.406 --> 09:56.092
Melissa Larson. No criminal record,

09:56.127 --> 09:58.573
but it turns out
that the cops suspected her

09:58.598 --> 10:00.225
of taking part in her father's crimes.

10:00.260 --> 10:01.266
They just couldn't prove it.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.935
She also trained as a gymnast

10:02.969 --> 10:04.712
and earned a master's in art history...

10:04.746 --> 10:06.005
ideal skills for an art thief.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.109
Well, if she's like her dad,
then she works freelance.

10:08.110 --> 10:10.111
Which means somebody probably
hired her to steal that painting.

10:10.145 --> 10:11.913
What does she do
for a living, officially?

10:11.947 --> 10:14.081
Occupation... professional gambler.

10:14.116 --> 10:15.983
Well, there you go.
That's the perfect cover.

10:16.018 --> 10:17.020
She gets paid in cash

10:17.054 --> 10:18.753
and launders her money through casinos.

10:18.787 --> 10:20.455
Now I really wish
I was playing an art thief.

10:20.489 --> 10:22.423
I want to play her.
She sounds super cool.

10:22.458 --> 10:24.826
She stole your friend's painting
and wrecked his life.

10:24.860 --> 10:26.828
Well, there is that.

10:26.862 --> 10:28.463
I think we need to talk to this woman.

10:28.497 --> 10:29.997
Wait. And say what?

10:30.032 --> 10:31.866
We can't prove she had anything
to do with the theft.

10:31.900 --> 10:32.948
She doesn't know that.

10:32.982 --> 10:34.936
Let's shake the tree
and see what falls out.

10:38.373 --> 10:39.998
Can I help you?

10:40.409 --> 10:42.810
Special Agent Toren and Stiles.

10:42.845 --> 10:44.979
Can we have a word with you?

10:45.013 --> 10:46.814
Sure.

10:46.849 --> 10:48.349
I have a minute.

10:51.987 --> 10:53.788
Can I get you something?

10:53.822 --> 10:56.324
Um, no, I'm fine.

10:56.358 --> 10:59.293
- Look, Ms. Larson.
- Please. First names.

10:59.328 --> 11:00.461
It's Melissa.

11:00.496 --> 11:02.530
- And you are?
- Vincent.

11:02.564 --> 11:03.998
Can you tell us where you were last night

11:04.032 --> 11:06.834
- around midnight?
- Melissa.

11:06.869 --> 11:08.069
Melissa.

11:08.103 --> 11:10.571
I like the way you say my name.

11:10.606 --> 11:11.739
You know what I'd like?

11:11.773 --> 11:13.875
For you to answer the question.

11:13.909 --> 11:19.514
Vincent, can I just say,
you are incredibly attractive.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.983
Well, that's... that's
awfully kind of you to say.

11:22.017 --> 11:23.985
I say what I feel.

11:24.019 --> 11:25.668
What do you feel?

11:26.522 --> 11:28.990
I'll answer you if you answer me.

11:29.024 --> 11:30.258
What do you know about Paul Dorsey?

11:30.292 --> 11:32.493
Nothing. Your turn.

11:32.528 --> 11:35.930
What are you thinking right now, Vince?

11:35.964 --> 11:38.990
If I weren't FBI
and you weren't an art thief,

11:39.768 --> 11:42.236
I don't know what would happen.

11:42.271 --> 11:43.871
I do.

11:43.906 --> 11:45.606
Can we get back on track here?

11:45.641 --> 11:47.774
Where were you last night, Melissa?

11:48.944 --> 11:52.747
With a friend... or two.

11:52.781 --> 11:56.050
But now I wish I had kept better company.

11:56.084 --> 11:59.202
You know, you...

12:00.789 --> 12:03.456
have the most spectacular eyes.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.032
Thank you?

12:09.998 --> 12:12.133
I'm afraid we have to wrap this up.

12:12.167 --> 12:13.716
I'm getting a massage.

12:14.736 --> 12:16.469
I'll be thinking of you.

12:16.905 --> 12:17.956
Both of you.

12:20.842 --> 12:24.979
You know, we know you stole
the Kaminsky, Melissa.

12:25.013 --> 12:26.047
This isn't over.

12:27.683 --> 12:29.717
Then I can't wait for round two.

12:30.686 --> 12:33.120
Man, she is good. Did you see that?

12:33.155 --> 12:34.494
She totally took control
of the interview.

12:34.519 --> 12:35.561
What interview?

12:35.596 --> 12:37.224
Doesn't "interview" mean
asking questions?

12:37.259 --> 12:38.492
I was working on that.

12:38.527 --> 12:40.161
How? By chatting her up?

12:40.195 --> 12:42.096
What kind of fake FBI agent
flirts that way?

12:42.130 --> 12:43.631
I was only flirting with her

12:43.665 --> 12:45.099
because she was flirting with me.

12:45.133 --> 12:46.133
Oh, so you felt obligated,

12:46.168 --> 12:47.969
like it would be rude
if you didn't reciprocate?

12:48.003 --> 12:49.156
It's a classic technique.

12:49.190 --> 12:51.005
I was building rapport with the suspect

12:51.039 --> 12:52.039
to get her to lower her guard.

12:52.074 --> 12:54.308
Oh, trust me,
her guard cannot get any lower.

12:54.343 --> 12:55.476
It's not like you did any better.

12:55.510 --> 12:57.845
I mean, she hit on you, and you
basically turned to mush.

12:57.879 --> 13:00.014
I was lulling her into thinking
she had the upper hand.

13:00.048 --> 13:01.806
Oh. Congratulations.
That worked like a charm.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.993
You know I heard
your whole conversation, right?

13:12.027 --> 13:14.028
You guys forget you were wired for sound?

13:14.062 --> 13:15.630
Oops.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.465
Anyway, what did, uh,
voice-stress analysis

13:17.499 --> 13:18.466
tell you about Melissa?

13:18.500 --> 13:20.267
That she's one cool customer.

13:20.302 --> 13:21.335
Well, what about when we asked her

13:21.370 --> 13:23.437
where she was or Dorsey
or the stolen painting?

13:23.472 --> 13:26.440
No stress in her voice,
at least not from lying.

13:26.475 --> 13:28.209
What do you mean?

13:28.243 --> 13:29.477
It's not relevant.

13:29.511 --> 13:30.878
W-Wait, how is it not relevant?

13:30.912 --> 13:32.113
Maybe it can help us.

13:32.147 --> 13:33.314
When did she get stressed?

13:33.348 --> 13:34.715
I wouldn't call it stress, exactly.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.384
More like agitation.

13:36.418 --> 13:39.220
Increased heart rate, rapid breathing...

13:39.254 --> 13:40.621
Look at you building a rapport.

13:40.656 --> 13:43.024
Hey, you can't blame me for her reaction.

13:43.058 --> 13:44.291
Yet I do.

13:44.326 --> 13:45.459
I picked up the same thing

13:45.494 --> 13:46.627
when she was talking to you.

13:46.662 --> 13:47.995
Ah, rest my case.

13:48.030 --> 13:50.031
Well, this was just an epic fiasco.

13:50.065 --> 13:51.565
Well, maybe not.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.234
I'm locked on to her cellphone.

13:53.268 --> 13:55.236
Melissa's making a call right now.

13:55.270 --> 13:56.671
Yeah?

13:56.705 --> 13:58.239
Let's do the exchange today,

13:58.273 --> 14:00.141
4:00 P.M. at Broadway and 4th Street.

14:00.175 --> 14:01.575
Got it.

14:01.610 --> 14:03.044
It worked.

14:03.078 --> 14:05.146
We rattled her. Now she's making a move.

14:05.180 --> 14:07.148
The exchange Melissa was talking about

14:07.182 --> 14:08.416
had to be about delivering the painting

14:08.450 --> 14:10.217
and collecting her fee.

14:10.252 --> 14:12.553
Yeah, this could be our chance to
find out who's behind the theft.

14:12.587 --> 14:14.055
Yeah, and get Paul's painting back,

14:14.089 --> 14:15.189
which would be amazing.

14:15.223 --> 14:16.557
We'll stake out Broadway and 4th.

14:16.591 --> 14:18.492
It's our best shot
to intercept that painting.

14:20.529 --> 14:22.163
But before that happens,

14:22.197 --> 14:23.862
time to call Troy Harper.

14:27.402 --> 14:28.436
Troy?

14:28.470 --> 14:30.144
Hi, it's Sam.

14:30.739 --> 14:32.188
Hi.

14:32.741 --> 14:35.676
Seriously, these flowers are incredible.

14:35.711 --> 14:38.112
I mean, it was just so thoughtful,

14:38.146 --> 14:40.915
so considerate, so chivalrous.

14:40.949 --> 14:43.217
Refreshingly uncynical.

14:43.251 --> 14:45.086
Ah.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.188
Yeah, I know. Me too.

14:47.222 --> 14:48.823
I had an incredible time.

14:49.825 --> 14:51.225
Yes.

14:51.259 --> 14:52.893
- Hey.
- We should do it again.

14:52.928 --> 14:55.196
- Zeus.
- I'll take it in my office.

14:57.933 --> 15:00.101
Yeah, no, okay.
That... That sounds great, Troy.

15:00.135 --> 15:01.268
I'll see you then.

15:01.303 --> 15:02.369
Okay, bye.

15:21.490 --> 15:23.390
Zeus intercepted
another phone call from Melissa.

15:23.425 --> 15:24.959
She changed the time and place
of the meet,

15:24.993 --> 15:26.460
so we got to leave here in five minutes.

15:26.495 --> 15:27.695
I can't wait.

15:35.003 --> 15:36.604
Well, no sign of Melissa.

15:39.174 --> 15:40.372
Maybe she knew we were listening

15:40.406 --> 15:42.967
and made that second call
to throw us off.

15:44.412 --> 15:46.113
So...

15:46.148 --> 15:49.917
your instincts were kind of
right about Troy Harper.

15:49.951 --> 15:51.002
How so?

15:51.036 --> 15:52.887
He's actually a convicted murderer.

15:52.921 --> 15:54.121
No, he isn't.

15:54.156 --> 15:57.057
- How do you know?
- What do you mean?

15:57.092 --> 16:00.961
Well, I mean, no, he isn't,
but how would you know that?

16:00.996 --> 16:02.463
I guess I just assumed.

16:02.497 --> 16:03.964
Well, based on all your snooping,

16:03.999 --> 16:06.267
I don't think
you assumed much of anything.

16:06.301 --> 16:07.434
What is that, Eddie?

16:07.469 --> 16:09.069
Like, I can't take care of myself?

16:09.104 --> 16:10.671
Like, I didn't think
to check him out, too?

16:10.705 --> 16:11.806
I'm sorry.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.808
You're my partner, and I was
just looking out for you.

16:13.842 --> 16:16.076
Mm. Is it that,
or are you feeling threatened?

16:16.111 --> 16:17.978
Threatened? What?
Why would I feel threatened?

16:18.013 --> 16:20.948
He is a handsome former model,
an Olympic medalist,

16:20.982 --> 16:24.118
also a doctor
who is literally curing cancer.

16:24.152 --> 16:25.753
No. Still not threatened.

16:29.124 --> 16:31.349
Oh, hey. I think that's her.

16:32.527 --> 16:34.936
That's a very Melissa-ish car.

16:35.697 --> 16:39.523
Yeah, and that must be whoever hired her.

16:40.035 --> 16:41.502
Wait, there it is.

16:41.536 --> 16:44.236
That's the painting, in that tube.

16:49.044 --> 16:50.177
That's her money.

16:50.212 --> 16:52.213
Well, they have the painting.
We can't let them get away.

16:52.247 --> 16:53.214
We're not going to.

17:04.526 --> 17:06.894
Eddie Valetik.
I'm a private investigator.

17:06.928 --> 17:08.127
Who's in the car?

17:08.163 --> 17:09.696
That's none of your business.

17:09.731 --> 17:11.464
Move that piece-of-crap truck.

17:11.499 --> 17:14.001
I believe you have something
that belongs to us.

17:14.035 --> 17:15.236
You mind stepping out of the vehicle?

17:15.270 --> 17:17.003
Or what? You gonna call the cops?

17:17.038 --> 17:18.172
Don't bother. We already did.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.406
You bring in the police,
this only gets worse for you.

17:20.442 --> 17:22.977
Yeah, well, I guess we'll see about that.

17:26.181 --> 17:27.348
That was quick.

17:27.382 --> 17:28.415
What seems to be the problem here?

17:28.450 --> 17:30.217
So glad to see you, gentlemen.

17:30.252 --> 17:31.852
These losers are harassing me.

17:31.887 --> 17:34.255
They cut us off. They won't let us leave.

17:34.289 --> 17:36.023
Sir, we're private investigators,

17:36.057 --> 17:37.491
and we cut him off because he has

17:37.525 --> 17:40.427
a priceless stolen painting.

17:40.461 --> 17:41.495
That's ridiculous.

17:41.529 --> 17:43.163
It's in a tube in his car.

17:43.198 --> 17:44.899
Look, take a look for yourself.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.568
Do you have what she's
talking about in there, sir?

17:47.602 --> 17:49.737
This? This is my personal property.

17:49.771 --> 17:51.538
I'd like to see it.

17:54.542 --> 17:55.643
Gotcha.

17:55.677 --> 17:58.853
Be careful with that, officer.
It's worth a fortune.

18:00.548 --> 18:03.065
See? What'd I tell you?

18:03.818 --> 18:05.219
The painting.

18:09.658 --> 18:11.292
A blueprint.

18:11.326 --> 18:12.860
What? That can't be right.

18:12.894 --> 18:15.195
Plans for my new tower on Wilshire.

18:15.230 --> 18:17.431
Are we, uh... Are we finished here or...?

18:17.465 --> 18:19.533
Unless you want to file charges.

18:19.567 --> 18:21.402
No.

18:21.436 --> 18:24.305
Chalk this up to a misunderstanding.

18:24.339 --> 18:26.140
Now move your truck.

18:29.913 --> 18:31.726
Your guy is Marcus Cutler.

18:31.777 --> 18:32.943
He's a wealthy real-estate magnate,

18:32.978 --> 18:34.156
but the more I looked into him,

18:34.191 --> 18:36.580
- the uglier it got.
- Sounds like stealing art

18:36.615 --> 18:38.849
- isn't the only bad thing he's done.
- Let's put it this way.

18:38.884 --> 18:41.052
He wanted to tear down
a neighborhood to build condos,

18:41.086 --> 18:42.019
so he floated rumors around

18:42.054 --> 18:44.422
that the area
was built on a toxic waste dump.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.924
Home prices plummeted,
enabling him to swoop in

18:46.958 --> 18:48.893
and purchase
all the houses at a discount.

18:48.927 --> 18:50.094
That's disgusting.

18:50.128 --> 18:51.562
Well, he's obviously mega-rich.

18:51.596 --> 18:52.897
Why not just buy the painting?

18:52.931 --> 18:55.266
Here's my in-depth
psychological analysis...

18:55.300 --> 18:56.467
because he's cheap.

18:56.501 --> 18:57.868
He has a rep for stiffing vendors

18:57.903 --> 18:59.270
and then suing them if they complain.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.938
So, what? He wanted the painting,

19:00.972 --> 19:02.540
but decided it was more cost-effective

19:02.574 --> 19:04.041
to just steal it?

19:04.076 --> 19:05.743
We can't let him get away with that.

19:05.777 --> 19:06.841
How are we gonna get it back?

19:06.875 --> 19:08.712
We need to talk that over
with our client.

19:09.981 --> 19:11.816
Marcus Cutler did this?

19:11.850 --> 19:12.883
So, you know him?

19:12.918 --> 19:16.554
Yeah. He's an "art collector"
of the worst kind.

19:16.588 --> 19:18.756
Uh, word is he bought up

19:18.790 --> 19:20.825
looted antiquities from the Middle East,

19:20.859 --> 19:23.094
paintings stolen by the Nazis.

19:23.128 --> 19:24.829
Cutler doesn't care about art.

19:24.863 --> 19:26.464
He isn't moved by it.

19:26.498 --> 19:29.900
He just acquires pieces
for the sake of having them.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.736
And did he ever
show interest in the Kaminsky?

19:32.771 --> 19:34.605
Not the Kaminsky.

19:34.639 --> 19:36.307
My auction house.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.741
That's what this is about.

19:37.776 --> 19:39.047
He wanted to buy you out.

19:39.081 --> 19:42.646
I turned him down, and now
he's gonna destroy me.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.248
That's who he is.

19:44.282 --> 19:46.083
I appreciate everything

19:46.118 --> 19:47.818
that you guys have done so far.

19:47.853 --> 19:48.999
I truly do.

19:49.033 --> 19:50.955
But we're at the point
where I need to just

19:50.989 --> 19:53.324
own up to this mess,

19:53.358 --> 19:54.992
go public with the theft,

19:55.026 --> 19:56.594
cancel the auction.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.129
Paul, don't do that.

19:58.163 --> 20:00.030
This is your whole life.

20:00.065 --> 20:01.532
Just give us a little more time.

20:01.566 --> 20:03.811
Sam, the auction is tomorrow.

20:04.136 --> 20:07.273
You know, we may still have
another move left.

20:07.973 --> 20:10.641
How much are you willing to pay
to get the painting back?

20:10.675 --> 20:12.009
You mean like some kind of ransom?

20:12.043 --> 20:14.044
Something like that.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.847
Well, given the situation,
I'd give everything I have.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.215
I need a number.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.186
Are you kidding?

20:22.220 --> 20:24.388
You want to hire Melissa
to steal the painting back?

20:24.422 --> 20:25.289
That's your plan?

20:25.323 --> 20:26.357
You have a better one?

20:26.391 --> 20:27.658
Any plan is better than that.

20:27.692 --> 20:28.893
Sam, we know she can do it.

20:28.927 --> 20:30.861
Plus, if she earned a lot from
stealing it the first time,

20:30.896 --> 20:32.135
now she can earn even more.

20:32.169 --> 20:33.898
We told Melissa that we were FBI agents.

20:33.932 --> 20:35.104
Now you want to turn around

20:35.139 --> 20:36.233
and convince her to steal for us?

20:36.268 --> 20:38.669
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
she knew we weren't FBI.

20:39.871 --> 20:42.673
Still, how can you possibly
get her to agree to this?

20:42.707 --> 20:44.675
Just through the sheer power
of your charm?

20:44.709 --> 20:46.877
What? You don't think I'm charming?

20:46.912 --> 20:48.913
- Not that charming.
- Mm.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.078
When are we going to see her?

20:50.113 --> 20:51.348
I think it's better if I go alone.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.050
- Do you?
- You said so yourself.

20:53.084 --> 20:54.518
I mean, we do have this rapport.

20:54.553 --> 20:56.096
Hey, she was into me, too.

20:56.131 --> 20:58.055
Yeah, but I have a better chance
at closing the deal.

20:58.089 --> 20:59.156
Huh.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.524
Not that kind of deal.

21:00.559 --> 21:02.059
Fine.

21:02.093 --> 21:03.494
But you are not going alone.

21:07.365 --> 21:08.999
You're wiring me for sound?

21:09.034 --> 21:11.035
Don't you think
that's a little unnecessary?

21:11.069 --> 21:12.269
You're meeting with a known criminal.

21:12.304 --> 21:14.939
I'm just looking out for my partner.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.907
She's not exactly Hannibal Lecter.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.243
Really? 'Cause it sure looked
like she wanted to eat you.

21:26.651 --> 21:28.118
I was hoping it would be you.

21:33.091 --> 21:36.237
Is your friend coming, or
do I have you all to myself?

21:37.062 --> 21:38.929
That depends.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.231
"That depends"? Depends on what?

21:40.265 --> 21:42.132
He's just playing her game, is all.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.101
Yeah, well, it sounds like
he's had a lot of practice.

21:44.135 --> 21:46.372
Melissa, just to be clear,

21:47.072 --> 21:49.073
I'm not FBI.

21:49.107 --> 21:50.584
I know that.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.944
I figured out who you are, Eddie.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.113
Well, then, you figured out who hired me.

21:56.147 --> 21:57.548
And that doesn't worry you?

21:57.582 --> 21:59.316
I felt a spark.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.085
That's rare for me.

22:01.119 --> 22:03.120
I want to see where it goes.

22:03.154 --> 22:05.089
How do you know I'm not wearing a wire?

22:05.123 --> 22:07.224
You probably are.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.593
I'm not sure you will be for long.

22:09.628 --> 22:10.995
I have a proposition for you.

22:11.029 --> 22:11.996
Let's talk about it after.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.764
I think we should
get it out of the way first.

22:13.798 --> 22:16.500
- I don't like waiting.
- I'll make it worth your while.

22:16.534 --> 22:17.768
Do you think he's really into her?

22:17.802 --> 22:19.837
I mean, 'cause that sounds
really real, okay?

22:19.871 --> 22:21.839
And this is coming from a trained actor.

22:21.873 --> 22:23.173
It's supposed to sound real.

22:23.208 --> 22:24.975
Not that real.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.577
This is weird. I can't listen.

22:26.611 --> 22:28.078
No one asked you to listen.

22:28.113 --> 22:30.080
The man didn't want to
get wired in the first place.

22:30.115 --> 22:32.283
He's just in there
trying to get her done.

22:32.317 --> 22:34.118
Well, he's trying to
get her done, all right.

22:43.161 --> 22:47.698
That is a dollar figure, a fee for a job.

22:47.732 --> 22:50.185
Would that fee be acceptable?

22:51.002 --> 22:54.471
The fee is acceptable, but the job isn't.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.106
I haven't even told you
what the job is yet.

22:56.141 --> 22:58.175
You don't need to.

22:58.209 --> 23:00.711
I have a code, Eddie.

23:00.745 --> 23:02.880
You have one, too, so you understand.

23:02.914 --> 23:05.883
Is there anything that I could do

23:05.917 --> 23:07.318
to change your mind?

23:11.356 --> 23:13.957
He's trying to close the deal
to close the deal.

23:20.765 --> 23:23.367
It's no to the job, Eddie,

23:23.401 --> 23:26.597
but my offer still stands.

23:28.340 --> 23:30.074
Another time.

23:37.248 --> 23:39.149
It was a good thing you had my back,

23:39.184 --> 23:41.552
'cause I barely
made it out of there alive.

23:44.022 --> 23:45.089
All right, look. I just...

23:45.123 --> 23:47.257
I just told her what I thought
she wanted to hear.

23:47.292 --> 23:49.059
That was me trying to
get Melissa to help.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.161
Obviously.
Why would I think anything else?

23:51.196 --> 23:52.730
I knew what you were saying wasn't real.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.064
None of that bothered me at all.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.033
Okay. Good.

23:56.067 --> 23:57.434
But you know what does bother me?

23:57.469 --> 23:58.936
Paul's auction is tomorrow,

23:58.970 --> 24:00.275
and the painting won't be there.

24:00.310 --> 24:03.273
Everything he has built
will just go down the drain.

24:03.308 --> 24:05.175
I don't suppose you have a plan "B"?

24:05.210 --> 24:07.012
Melissa was plan "B."

24:08.713 --> 24:10.599
Then I have a plan "C."

24:11.282 --> 24:12.349
Who needs Melissa?

24:12.384 --> 24:14.084
What if we steal the painting?

24:17.643 --> 24:20.017
Let's be clear.
Stealing the painting back

24:20.042 --> 24:21.076
is a Hail Mary plan.

24:21.110 --> 24:22.143
Yeah, but if we pull it off,

24:22.178 --> 24:25.013
we save our client's career.
Plus it'll be awesome.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.414
That dirt bag Cutler has it coming.

24:26.449 --> 24:27.916
For starters, we need to
answer two questions.

24:27.950 --> 24:29.517
First, where is the painting?

24:29.552 --> 24:31.086
I checked. Cutler has 21

24:31.120 --> 24:33.021
commercial and residential
properties in L.A.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.190
He'd probably keep it close,
in one of those buildings.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.458
We'll try to narrow down which one.

24:36.492 --> 24:38.026
Which brings us to question two...

24:38.060 --> 24:39.164
how do we gain entry?

24:39.198 --> 24:40.318
I got intel on that.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.764
All of Cutler's properties
use encrypted key cards.

24:42.798 --> 24:44.766
So, what we need
is an all-access key card.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.101
That way, wherever the painting is,

24:46.135 --> 24:47.969
- we can get at it.
- How do we get one of those?

24:48.004 --> 24:49.004
What we need to do

24:49.038 --> 24:51.406
is clone a key card
from one of these three men.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.741
That's Cutler.

24:52.775 --> 24:54.142
Then there's this dude, Michael Gould,

24:54.176 --> 24:55.276
his security chief.

24:55.311 --> 24:57.212
Yeah, he was driving Cutler.
Look, these guys know us.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.713
We can't get near them.

24:58.748 --> 25:00.715
Well, then, that leaves us
with this guy...

25:00.750 --> 25:03.385
Nick Brennan, facilities manager.

25:03.419 --> 25:07.055
- What do we know about him?
- Nick Brennan.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.991
Lives in Studio City, 35, single.

25:10.026 --> 25:11.960
He has a profile on Matchstrike.com.

25:11.994 --> 25:13.995
How would know...
Wait, are you on Matchstrike?

25:14.030 --> 25:15.120
Maybe.

25:15.155 --> 25:17.916
He says he's looking for
a sensitive woman.

25:18.501 --> 25:21.936
I'm a sensitive woman. No, seriously.

25:21.971 --> 25:24.673
What if I put up a fake profile,
invite him to Zeus' bar,

25:24.707 --> 25:25.740
and take his key card?

25:25.775 --> 25:27.075
It worked in "Sneakers."

25:27.109 --> 25:28.576
- That was a great movie.
- But this is real life.

25:28.611 --> 25:29.911
I mean, we're running out of time.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.179
And besides, what makes you think

25:31.213 --> 25:32.747
that he'd even meet with you?

25:32.782 --> 25:34.983
You're not the only one
who can be charming.

25:39.221 --> 25:42.023
Can't believe she got this guy
to show up in under an hour.

25:42.058 --> 25:44.693
I'm really not sure
why that surprises you.

25:44.727 --> 25:45.927
We pull this off, Eddie,

25:45.961 --> 25:48.163
I get to actually be an art thief.

25:48.197 --> 25:49.197
No, you won't.

25:49.231 --> 25:51.266
If there's gonna be
any stealing, I'm doing it.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.001
You'd face charges if you got caught.

25:53.035 --> 25:54.169
It's too risky.

25:54.203 --> 25:55.603
Excuse me. You don't get to decide

25:55.638 --> 25:57.338
if I can or cannot steal.

25:57.373 --> 25:59.841
For now, why don't you be
a key-card thief?

25:59.875 --> 26:01.976
Sam, you clear on what to do, darling?

26:02.011 --> 26:02.877
Yeah. Get the key card

26:02.912 --> 26:04.612
and put it in the card-scanner thing.

26:04.647 --> 26:06.047
Then you got to get the key card

26:06.082 --> 26:07.148
back into his pocket.

26:07.183 --> 26:09.217
He's got to walk out of here
not knowing we copied it.

26:09.251 --> 26:10.151
Okay.

26:10.186 --> 26:12.053
Well, here he is.

26:12.088 --> 26:15.265
About to meet the sensitive
woman of his dreams.

26:16.025 --> 26:17.425
Hi.

26:18.594 --> 26:22.197
Cutler owns six homes,
four of which he leases out.

26:22.231 --> 26:23.898
Plus three high-rise condos,

26:23.933 --> 26:27.068
seven office towers, five warehouses.

26:27.103 --> 26:28.336
The painting could be in any one of them.

26:28.370 --> 26:31.239
So, let's start with his houses,

26:31.273 --> 26:33.174
and then check tenant lists
to see if he rents space out

26:33.209 --> 26:34.868
in any of the other buildings.

26:35.845 --> 26:39.706
So, uh, what made you decide to
sign up for Matchstrike.com?

26:40.883 --> 26:44.385
It helps me filter out people
that fetishize Asian women.

26:44.420 --> 26:47.088
I connect with cool outliers
I'd probably never meet.

26:47.123 --> 26:48.256
You should try it.

26:48.290 --> 26:50.342
I've read those profiles.

26:51.060 --> 26:54.596
Everyone's so funny and smart,

26:54.630 --> 26:55.764
confident.

26:55.798 --> 26:57.599
I can't compete with that.

26:57.633 --> 26:59.726
I just don't look that good on paper.

27:01.403 --> 27:03.238
Paper!

27:03.272 --> 27:04.305
What?

27:04.340 --> 27:06.875
I think I know which building
the painting is in.

27:06.909 --> 27:09.344
That card emits an RFID signal,

27:09.378 --> 27:11.079
so we should be able to see
where he's got it.

27:14.817 --> 27:16.184
Sam, the key card's

27:16.218 --> 27:18.920
in the inside left pocket of his jacket.

27:18.954 --> 27:21.856
So, tell me about you.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.958
Who is Maggie Wilcox?

27:23.993 --> 27:25.093
Who is she?

27:25.127 --> 27:27.095
That is a great question.

27:27.129 --> 27:28.696
Do you want the real answer?

27:28.731 --> 27:30.231
Well, real is all I've been looking for.

27:31.245 --> 27:33.101
Then the jacket's got to go, Nick.

27:33.135 --> 27:34.269
What do you mean?

27:34.303 --> 27:35.770
It's armor.

27:35.805 --> 27:37.238
It's distancing, you know,

27:37.273 --> 27:39.941
and I'm about to be vulnerable with you.

27:39.975 --> 27:42.744
Of course. Yeah, I totally get that.

27:42.778 --> 27:44.145
I can't believe he fell for that.

27:44.180 --> 27:45.755
Well, look at Nick's face.

27:45.789 --> 27:46.815
She got him.

27:46.849 --> 27:48.550
What she needs to get is the key card.

27:48.584 --> 27:53.388
The truth is, Nick,
I had an awesome career,

27:53.422 --> 27:56.791
but it flamed out because
I couldn't stop drinking

27:56.826 --> 27:59.127
or making a fool of myself.

27:59.161 --> 28:01.229
But I came out on the other side.

28:01.263 --> 28:05.250
I got sober, and in most ways,
my life is better.

28:05.835 --> 28:08.236
I lost some things I may never get back,

28:08.270 --> 28:11.005
but I'm present, and I've realized

28:11.040 --> 28:13.159
that the world doesn't revolve around me.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.636
I didn't know she felt that way.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.181
Or maybe she's just acting.

28:20.216 --> 28:23.751
The only thing missing
is someone to share it with,

28:23.786 --> 28:27.789
someone kind and decent,

28:27.823 --> 28:30.692
someone to laugh with, cry with,

28:30.726 --> 28:35.196
someone to love and protect
who can love and protect me...

28:36.414 --> 28:38.867
a real partner in life.

28:39.826 --> 28:42.303
See, I've never really had that before.

28:42.338 --> 28:44.973
I mean, probably because
I wasn't ready for it,

28:45.007 --> 28:47.918
but now I am.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.212
You know, someone's
that good at pretending,

28:51.247 --> 28:54.115
how do you ever trust
what they're saying is real?

28:54.149 --> 28:55.516
That was real.

28:55.551 --> 28:57.719
It just wasn't meant for him.

28:58.420 --> 29:02.790
First of all, thank you
for sharing that with me.

29:02.825 --> 29:03.992
It is so...

29:08.664 --> 29:10.965
Sorry.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.317
Hello?

29:13.335 --> 29:17.171
Yeah... L-Listen,
I-I-I'm just in a meeting.

29:17.206 --> 29:19.533
She's got the card.

29:20.376 --> 29:22.043
Sam, make sure all the lights turn green.

29:22.077 --> 29:23.411
That's when the card's been cloned.

29:23.445 --> 29:25.213
Yes, sir. I... But I just...

29:25.247 --> 29:27.382
Come on.

29:27.416 --> 29:29.884
Okay. I'll be right there.

29:32.721 --> 29:36.991
Maggie. I am so terribly sorry.

29:37.026 --> 29:39.260
That was my boss. I have to go.

29:39.295 --> 29:40.695
- Uh-oh.
- All right, Sam,

29:40.729 --> 29:43.364
you've got to get the key card
back into his pocket.

29:43.399 --> 29:44.399
Nick, you can't go. I just...

29:44.433 --> 29:46.334
I just bared my soul to you.

29:46.368 --> 29:48.436
I know. I really need to leave.

29:54.076 --> 29:55.743
You can go.

29:55.778 --> 29:57.712
Just go ahead and go.

29:57.746 --> 29:59.698
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

30:08.557 --> 30:10.358
You really are a sensitive woman.

30:12.561 --> 30:15.096
I just told him what he wanted to hear.

30:15.130 --> 30:16.364
I was in the moment.

30:16.398 --> 30:18.271
Barely even remember what I said.

30:18.305 --> 30:19.400
How do you do that,

30:19.435 --> 30:22.036
open yourself up to a complete stranger?

30:22.071 --> 30:23.738
Used a little acting trick...

30:23.772 --> 30:25.406
pretended he was someone else.

30:27.609 --> 30:28.609
Who?

30:31.447 --> 30:32.413
Troy.

30:40.422 --> 30:42.256
Killed it.

30:42.291 --> 30:44.492
We have a key card of our very own.

30:44.526 --> 30:45.927
And we figured out where the painting is.

30:45.961 --> 30:47.462
How?

30:47.496 --> 30:49.230
Paper, paintings...

30:49.264 --> 30:51.466
they need to be protected
from heat and humidity.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.735
So we looked, and only two
of Cutler's buildings

30:53.769 --> 30:56.904
have climate-control systems
specifically designed for art...

30:56.939 --> 30:58.940
a warehouse and one of his mansions.

30:58.974 --> 31:00.341
We think the painting's in that mansion.

31:00.376 --> 31:02.410
Did you just say "one" of his mansions?

31:02.444 --> 31:04.312
Well, he collects real estate
like he collects art

31:04.346 --> 31:06.114
and makes a fortune out of this one

31:06.148 --> 31:07.849
by renting it for high-end functions.

31:07.883 --> 31:10.985
In fact, they're holding
a gala there tonight.

31:14.356 --> 31:15.323
Melissa.

31:15.357 --> 31:16.691
What are you doing here?

31:16.725 --> 31:18.626
If you're up to
what I think you're up to.

31:18.660 --> 31:20.111
You're gonna need my help.

31:22.992 --> 31:24.660
These are blueprints for the mansion.

31:24.694 --> 31:25.827
How'd you get them?

31:25.862 --> 31:28.230
A contact at Building and Safety.

31:28.264 --> 31:30.832
I planned the Kaminsky job
for three months.

31:30.867 --> 31:33.135
I hate the idea of doing this on a clock.

31:33.169 --> 31:34.202
Then why are you doing it at all?

31:34.237 --> 31:36.038
Why should we trust you?

31:36.072 --> 31:40.008
I collected my fee,
and Cutler paid me with these.

31:40.043 --> 31:41.176
Counterfeit bills.

31:41.210 --> 31:42.711
Wow. He really is cheap.

31:42.745 --> 31:44.646
I can't exactly press charges, can I?

31:44.681 --> 31:47.182
He knew I had no recourse.

31:47.216 --> 31:49.057
But now I do.

31:50.353 --> 31:51.720
There.

31:51.754 --> 31:52.753
Check that out.

31:52.787 --> 31:54.089
It says "Utility room."

31:54.123 --> 31:56.224
Not with steel-clad walls and no windows.

31:56.259 --> 31:57.526
It's a vault.

31:57.560 --> 31:58.660
That's where the painting is.

31:58.695 --> 32:01.063
And we need to get it out
of there in the next 12 hours.

32:01.097 --> 32:02.431
We may be able to do that sooner.

32:02.465 --> 32:03.746
I hacked into the RSVP site,

32:03.780 --> 32:05.267
and I got you on the guest list
for the gala.

32:05.301 --> 32:07.169
And I checked... Cutler won't be there.

32:07.203 --> 32:08.570
If you can go in through the front door,

32:08.604 --> 32:10.372
you don't need me for this.

32:10.406 --> 32:12.664
Well, then, I have another job for you.

32:13.309 --> 32:16.745
If it'll help screw over Cutler,
count me in.

32:16.779 --> 32:18.347
I'm your plus-one.

32:18.381 --> 32:19.494
We're in this together.

32:19.528 --> 32:21.249
Then you guys better get rocking.

32:21.284 --> 32:24.086
It starts in an hour, and it's black-tie.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.420
You have something to wear?

32:25.455 --> 32:26.455
Yep. You?

32:26.489 --> 32:27.522
Yep.

32:27.557 --> 32:28.657
Hey.

32:28.691 --> 32:31.293
Tell me what you think about
this Matchstrike profile.

32:31.327 --> 32:33.695
"I'm an L.A. native
who's curious about the world

32:33.730 --> 32:36.098
with a passion for Thai food,
Thai boxing,

32:36.132 --> 32:37.899
and hiking Sycamore Canyon.

32:37.934 --> 32:39.801
I play guitar, but I'm not great at it.

32:39.836 --> 32:41.303
I'm respectful, a devoted friend,

32:41.337 --> 32:44.406
and I try to live life with
an open mind and open heart.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.365
If you want to know more, let's connect."

32:48.111 --> 32:50.579
Yeah? This guy sounds all right.

32:50.613 --> 32:53.281
- It's you.
- What?

32:53.316 --> 32:56.251
See? Not so bad on paper.

32:56.285 --> 32:57.419
How did you know all this?

32:57.453 --> 33:00.255
Because when you talk, I listen.

33:02.025 --> 33:04.059
So...

33:04.093 --> 33:06.928
is this the kind of profile
you'd swipe right on?

33:06.963 --> 33:08.964
Post it on Matchstrike
and see what happens.

33:10.933 --> 33:13.335
You seen Sam? She here yet?

33:13.369 --> 33:15.310
Whoa.

33:16.436 --> 33:18.106
Coming!

33:30.720 --> 33:32.619
Well, you look...

33:33.389 --> 33:34.589
presentable.

33:38.361 --> 33:40.295
I guess I can be seen with you.

33:49.872 --> 33:51.873
First and last time I play chauffeur.

33:51.908 --> 33:54.176
Oh, really? Why don't I play chauffeur
and you steal the painting?

33:54.210 --> 33:56.378
Well, since you put it that way...

33:56.412 --> 33:58.380
I'll keep track of you off the key card,

33:58.414 --> 34:00.605
and I'll be in your ear
to guide you the whole way.

34:01.184 --> 34:02.350
Good luck in there.

34:02.385 --> 34:04.442
Let's get Paul's painting back.

34:23.239 --> 34:24.545
What?

34:26.175 --> 34:27.549
Nothing.

34:28.344 --> 34:31.246
So, Zeus, how we looking?

34:31.280 --> 34:33.721
Stairway should be just up ahead.

34:35.348 --> 34:38.487
Yeah, and I see that
there's a guard there.

34:41.257 --> 34:43.824
There's another stairway
at the north end of the house.

34:43.860 --> 34:45.659
I'm sure there's a guard there, too.

34:45.695 --> 34:48.362
We just have to figure out
how to get past this one.

34:48.397 --> 34:49.598
I know.

34:49.632 --> 34:51.399
Unzip my dress.

34:51.434 --> 34:53.068
What? Here?

34:53.101 --> 34:54.902
Yes. Unzip it now.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.241
I'm not really sure
I have faith in this idea.

34:59.275 --> 35:00.442
All right. Just go halfway down.

35:00.476 --> 35:02.377
Just do it, then follow my lead.

35:10.286 --> 35:12.921
Hey. Psst.

35:12.955 --> 35:14.789
Come here.

35:14.824 --> 35:16.258
Ma'am, I really shouldn't.

35:16.292 --> 35:17.348
Please?

35:21.297 --> 35:22.566
Okay, I just... I need your help.

35:22.601 --> 35:26.234
So, I ran into my ex in the wine cellar.

35:26.269 --> 35:27.903
We got a little carried away.

35:27.937 --> 35:29.903
Can you zip up my dress?

35:31.841 --> 35:33.208
Please?

35:33.242 --> 35:34.526
Zip it up.

35:35.041 --> 35:37.312
Thank you. You're so strong.

35:40.016 --> 35:42.417
All right. I'm on the second floor.

35:42.451 --> 35:44.786
I see you.

35:44.820 --> 35:47.589
Take a right. At the next hall,
go all the way to the end.

35:52.828 --> 35:55.397
Then you'll hang another right,
go through the bar area.

35:55.431 --> 35:56.865
The vault's at the far end.

36:01.470 --> 36:04.906
Oh. Flag on the play.

36:04.941 --> 36:06.608
Remember the three key-card holders?

36:06.642 --> 36:08.310
One of them just walked into the house.

36:08.344 --> 36:10.312
He's approaching the staircase, Sam.

36:21.624 --> 36:23.758
It's Gould. He's seen me.

36:23.793 --> 36:25.927
Sam, stay calm. We'll get this sorted.

36:25.962 --> 36:27.629
What are you doing here?

36:27.663 --> 36:29.598
What are you doing here?

36:29.632 --> 36:30.599
I was invited.

36:30.633 --> 36:31.833
I don't think so.

36:31.867 --> 36:33.301
Detain her.

36:33.336 --> 36:35.036
She's trespassing.

36:35.071 --> 36:37.505
Hey! Come on, get your hands off me.

36:37.540 --> 36:40.308
Now, tell me. What are you
doing in this house?

36:40.343 --> 36:41.599
Let go.

36:42.245 --> 36:43.211
The art vault.

36:43.246 --> 36:45.180
Let's go.

36:45.214 --> 36:47.449
Eddie, they're on to you.

36:47.483 --> 36:50.018
I'm almost there. I can't turn back now.

36:50.052 --> 36:51.519
They're coming, man.

36:51.554 --> 36:53.488
Get out of there. It's trespassing now,

36:53.522 --> 36:55.390
but don't turn it into a felony B&E.

36:57.893 --> 36:59.006
I'm in.

37:05.201 --> 37:06.266
Damn it.

37:06.301 --> 37:08.370
The painting... It's not here.

37:08.404 --> 37:10.572
It's game over, Mr. Valetik.

37:16.808 --> 37:18.776
Well, that could've gone better.

37:18.810 --> 37:20.311
Yeah.

37:20.345 --> 37:21.946
We're going to jail, aren't we?

37:21.980 --> 37:24.115
Well, at least we'll be the
best-dressed people in there.

37:24.149 --> 37:25.883
Aww, you like the way I look.

37:25.917 --> 37:27.518
Well, you're not half bad...

37:27.552 --> 37:29.320
for a felon.

37:29.354 --> 37:31.956
I saw how much you liked unzipping me.

37:31.990 --> 37:33.391
You think this is sexy?

37:33.425 --> 37:35.059
Wait till you see me
in an orange jumpsuit.

37:35.093 --> 37:37.294
Orange is my favorite color.

37:37.329 --> 37:38.329
Thank you, Officer.

37:38.363 --> 37:39.330
Oh.

37:41.700 --> 37:44.468
Did you really think
you could go up against me?

37:44.503 --> 37:45.836
Huh?

37:45.871 --> 37:47.238
Take what's mine?

37:47.272 --> 37:49.840
The bad press,
the lawsuits I'm gonna file...

37:49.875 --> 37:52.128
it's all downhill from here.

37:53.245 --> 37:54.678
Remember this moment.

37:57.416 --> 37:59.350
It can't end like this, can it?

37:59.384 --> 38:01.352
Us in cuffs, the bad guy winning?

38:01.386 --> 38:03.521
It's not over till it's over.

38:06.258 --> 38:09.660
And we come now to lot 17.

38:09.694 --> 38:14.265
This exquisite piece
is from artist Godrick McMains,

38:14.299 --> 38:17.868
a prime example of his work
from the Barcelona period.

38:17.903 --> 38:21.157
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
let's just move on to lot 21.

38:22.450 --> 38:25.076
Sir, would you kindly sit down?

38:25.110 --> 38:28.598
Everybody's here for
the Kaminsky, am I right?

38:29.165 --> 38:31.682
So, let's move on to the main event.

38:32.251 --> 38:33.751
Get this show on the road.

38:33.785 --> 38:36.220
Mr. Cutler, the items are auctioned

38:36.254 --> 38:38.055
in a predetermined order.

38:38.090 --> 38:39.356
Yeah, so you say.

38:39.391 --> 38:41.292
But from what I hear,

38:41.326 --> 38:43.394
you don't even have the painting, Paul.

38:43.428 --> 38:46.263
I know. It's shocking, right?

38:46.298 --> 38:49.433
Rumor is somebody stole it.

38:51.903 --> 38:53.471
I think you need to assure everyone

38:53.505 --> 38:57.108
that what they came for, Paul,
is actually here.

38:59.578 --> 39:01.145
Put up or shut up.

39:08.487 --> 39:10.456
Lot 21.

39:12.491 --> 39:14.592
The Kaminsky.

39:14.626 --> 39:15.793
Happy now?

39:25.937 --> 39:27.304
You're supposed to be in jail.

39:27.339 --> 39:29.006
Oh, we were headed there,

39:29.040 --> 39:32.076
but then the L.A.P.D.
took interest in our story.

39:32.110 --> 39:34.979
Especially when they heard
about your warehouse.

39:35.013 --> 39:36.447
My warehouse?

39:36.481 --> 39:37.748
Well, we knew you had two buildings

39:37.782 --> 39:39.316
equipped to store art.

39:39.351 --> 39:42.019
Did you think we wouldn't hit them both?

39:42.053 --> 39:44.321
So, we did a little exploring,

39:44.356 --> 39:47.024
and we photographed what we found.

39:47.058 --> 39:50.461
Yeah, and a lot of other photos
were taken, too...

39:50.495 --> 39:51.843
paintings, of sculptures,

39:51.878 --> 39:54.165
all that seemed to have
questionable origins.

39:54.199 --> 39:57.868
See, once the L.A.P.D. got interested,

39:57.903 --> 40:01.505
well, then, the FBI
got really interested.

40:09.414 --> 40:11.248
Remember this moment.

40:12.918 --> 40:16.854
Sam, Eddie, I-I don't know
how to ever repay you.

40:16.888 --> 40:18.222
Watching Cutler get led away

40:18.256 --> 40:20.558
was practically payment enough.

40:20.592 --> 40:22.860
Hey, remember that Hockney
you had to give up?

40:22.894 --> 40:24.695
What if that were to show up
on your doorstep?

40:24.729 --> 40:26.564
Paul, you do not have to do that.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.699
But I wouldn't say no.

40:28.733 --> 40:30.334
Consider it done.

40:30.368 --> 40:32.169
Uh, I got to get back to my clients.

40:32.204 --> 40:33.530
Thank you.

40:38.343 --> 40:41.005
A crazy few days, right?

40:42.614 --> 40:44.508
So what now?

40:45.283 --> 40:47.051
I was asking myself the same question.

40:57.562 --> 40:59.231
Melissa?

40:59.731 --> 41:01.565
Yeah, we're gonna grab a bite.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.698
I bet.

41:06.304 --> 41:07.698
Troy.

41:08.740 --> 41:10.441
Yeah, we, uh,

41:10.475 --> 41:13.210
made plans to meet tonight.

41:13.245 --> 41:14.211
Okay.

41:20.485 --> 41:22.004
Till tomorrow, then?

41:23.054 --> 41:24.421
Till tomorrow.
