00:02.103 --> 00:04.372
A POP Original Series

00:06.074 --> 00:07.375
(Birds chirp)

00:09.677 --> 00:11.312
- All right.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.114
(Door opens)

00:13.147 --> 00:15.149
- Morning, David.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.453
- Ew. What are you all doing
here?

00:19.487 --> 00:21.755
- We have a surprise for you.

00:21.789 --> 00:25.093
- Judging from the looks on
your faces, I don't want it.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.128
- Stevie?
- Stevie?

00:27.161 --> 00:30.598
- Something arrived
at the front desk for you.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.068
Ah!

00:35.436 --> 00:39.373
- It appears someone has
something to celebrate.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.409
- Why would Patrick do that?

00:41.442 --> 00:43.344
- That was my first thought.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.113
Celebrating a monthly
anniversary

00:45.146 --> 00:46.580
seems a bit of a reach.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.716
But then Alexis informed us

00:48.749 --> 00:52.586
that this is the longest
relationship you've ever had!

00:52.620 --> 00:55.323
- Four whole months, David.
- How 'bout that?

00:55.356 --> 00:59.860
- Okay, this is not the longest
relationship I've ever had.

00:59.893 --> 01:03.764
I had a... very intimate
connection with Tony,

01:03.797 --> 01:04.765
for several years.

01:04.798 --> 01:05.266
I had a... very intimate
connection with Tony,

01:05.299 --> 01:05.966
for several years.

01:05.999 --> 01:06.033
- She was your pen pal, David.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.569
- She was in a penitentiary,
dear.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.139
- Well, this calls
for a celebration.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.407
- Now Roland just found
a barbecue in the shed,

01:13.441 --> 01:16.810
so I say you invite Patrick
over, we fire it up,

01:16.844 --> 01:18.879
and have a good old fashioned
Rose family barbecue.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.281
- Yes, David.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.815
- I mean, we already have
dessert.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.884
I mean, this would feed
at least 10 people.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.120
- Okay, first of all,
no one's sharing the cookie.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.355
And second of all,

01:27.388 --> 01:29.257
Patrick is not being invited
to a barbecue.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.126
- Is he pulling back?
- No!

01:32.160 --> 01:33.761
- Has he asked you
about an open relationship?

01:33.794 --> 01:36.197
- Not yet. Anyway,
everything is fine,

01:36.230 --> 01:38.832
which is why I would rather
not subject him

01:38.866 --> 01:42.603
to eating charred meat
with this group of carnies.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.338
- Carnies are people too.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.874
- David, could you just once
embrace joy?

01:46.907 --> 01:47.841
- Okay.

01:48.742 --> 01:49.610
- Perhaps it's this nay-saying
reticence

01:50.578 --> 01:51.345
that caused your past
relationships to...

01:52.045 --> 01:53.281
- Fall apart.
-...oxidize.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.848
- Oxidize.
- Okay, you know what?

01:54.882 --> 01:56.350
I think we're good here.
Thanks.

01:56.384 --> 01:57.785
- So you're bringing Patrick?

01:57.818 --> 01:59.553
- Nope, Patrick's still not
coming.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.355
Bye bye.

02:02.590 --> 02:07.228
(Sniffs cookie)
Oh yeah, it's soft.

02:07.728 --> 02:11.532
♪♪♪

02:12.500 --> 02:14.868
(Jazz music plays)

02:14.902 --> 02:17.171
(Door opens and closes)

02:17.905 --> 02:22.176
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

02:22.210 --> 02:24.245
- Take it the cookie
went over well?

02:24.278 --> 02:26.480
- I have told you
for three months now,

02:26.514 --> 02:29.617
that I don't want a monthly
anniversary gift.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.785
And I know you think
it's very funny,

02:31.819 --> 02:34.188
but this time it went too far.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.656
- It's a cookie, David,
what's the big deal?

02:35.689 --> 02:37.658
- First of all, a cookie
is always a big deal,

02:37.691 --> 02:40.728
especially when that cookie
just alerted my entire family

02:40.761 --> 02:42.530
to the fact that this is

02:42.563 --> 02:45.599
officially the longest
relationship I've ever had.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.969
- This is the longest
relationship you've ever had?

02:49.002 --> 02:52.406
Oh, I shoulda got you
more than a cookie.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.508
- Okay, well the cookie
was almost too much.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.410
Figuratively speaking.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.212
I ate half of it
on the way here.

02:58.246 --> 03:01.782
Bottom line, I just don't think
we need to celebrate as much.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.418
You know, we could just go
day-to-day like normal people.

03:04.452 --> 03:08.389
If we throw a... if we throw a
renaissance fair every month,

03:08.422 --> 03:10.724
I just feel like
we might be tempting fate.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.527
- We are not tempting fate,
okay?

03:13.561 --> 03:15.729
I can't speak to your past,

03:15.763 --> 03:17.465
but I think you might
have an easier time of it,

03:17.498 --> 03:18.999
and maybe a little bit
more fun,

03:19.032 --> 03:21.569
if you just learn
to trust people.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.506
- The last time I heard that,
I was dating a birthday clown

03:25.539 --> 03:27.408
who painted my face
in the night,

03:27.441 --> 03:29.977
and was literally never seen
from again.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.912
- Noted.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.249
You have nothing
to worry about, David,

03:35.283 --> 03:38.386
and I can return these tickets
to the Julia Stiles-a-thon

03:38.419 --> 03:39.987
at the drive-in tonight.
- Let me see those.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.922
- I agree, that might have been
a little overboard.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.757
- Okay, first of all,
let it be known

03:43.791 --> 03:45.926
that supporting Julia Stiles
is never going overboard.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.995
- Oh, so you can go?
- Um, not tonight.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.598
Tonight I have a thing,
but tomorrow I could come.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.333
- What's your thing tonight?

03:52.366 --> 03:55.703
- Um, it's just like a family
thing at the motel.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.705
It's like a nothing thing.
You wouldn't...

03:57.738 --> 04:00.508
- Okay, well tomorrow night
it is.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.511
Now I gotta go to town hall
to get some signatures

04:03.544 --> 04:05.546
for our permit renewal,
but don't worry, David,

04:05.579 --> 04:08.682
unlike the birthday clown,
I will be back.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.820
- He was never found.
- Probably dead.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.523
(Bell jingles, door shuts)

04:15.556 --> 04:17.725
- You just fill this out
and I'll get ya checked in.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.593
- Great, thanks.
- Hey girl.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.663
- Oh, you're talkin' to me?

04:22.696 --> 04:25.433
- Yeah, who else would I be
talking to? No offense.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.370
- What's up?

04:29.403 --> 04:31.972
- Okay, so I wanted to get some
advice, like girl-to-girl,

04:32.005 --> 04:34.375
'cause you're always so good
with boy stuff.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.744
- So David's at work and you
had nobody else to talk to?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.412
- What?

04:38.446 --> 04:39.747
That's...

04:39.780 --> 04:41.549
So I got this message from Ted,

04:41.582 --> 04:43.417
and I wanted to get someone's -
your -

04:43.451 --> 04:45.953
- Mhmm.
- your, specific opinion

04:45.986 --> 04:47.555
before I replied.

04:47.588 --> 04:51.359
Okay, so this is what Ted
sent this morning.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.430
- I'm more of a bagel guy,
winky face?

04:56.464 --> 04:58.899
- Keep in mind we haven't seen
each other in weeks.

04:58.932 --> 05:02.336
- Okay, so it was an accident.

05:02.370 --> 05:05.739
- Or, it was made to look like
an accident.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.476
- Okay.
- It's a tactic, Stevie.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.579
You send someone a random text
message to get their attention,

05:11.612 --> 05:13.747
and then the next thing you
know, you're talking again.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.950
- Who would do that?
- I've done that. Like a lot.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.952
- I did it last week.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.522
- This is why I choose not
to be in a relationship.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.526
- Hey... Alexis.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.928
- Rachel, sorry,
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

05:27.961 --> 05:29.630
but that's like the oldest
trick in the book.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.098
Texting a bunch of letters
and saying your phone

05:31.131 --> 05:33.367
was unlocked in your purse.
- Right?

05:33.401 --> 05:35.869
I used to text Zac Efron
just like a question mark

05:35.903 --> 05:37.671
whenever I wanted a booty call.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.707
Poor thing would be like
buzzing my apartment

05:39.740 --> 05:41.409
before I even pressed send.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.110
- That's actually
how my fiancé and I

05:43.143 --> 05:44.812
keep getting back together.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.514
- Okay, Rachel,
you're in Room 9.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.449
- Oh, actually we're
just finishing up.

05:48.482 --> 05:51.485
Um, okay so what do you think
I should write back?

05:51.519 --> 05:53.954
- Honestly, I don't know
anything about your
relationship,

05:53.987 --> 05:56.023
but I do know that games
only get you so far.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.125
Unless you wanna end up
like me, 6 months later,

05:58.158 --> 06:00.561
tryin' to win him back
for the 50th time.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.531
- Mmhm. Having flashbacks
of Zac Efron.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.766
- Isn't it easier to just
be direct?

06:05.799 --> 06:07.601
Either way, you get an answer.

06:07.635 --> 06:11.672
- You're like super smart,
and pretty in like a breezy,

06:11.705 --> 06:13.974
non-threatening sort of way.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.078
- Another successful girl talk.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.581
(Door shuts, footsteps clank)

06:20.614 --> 06:22.550
- You know, Roland, when you
said you found a grill,

06:22.583 --> 06:24.585
this isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

06:24.618 --> 06:28.121
- What'd you expect Johnny,
Benihana? (Laughs)

06:28.155 --> 06:31.792
- No, there's no dials,
no tanks, no side burners.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.728
I mean, I wasn't expecting
a built-in wine fridge,

06:34.762 --> 06:39.433
but this is nothing... like
what I'm used to cooking on.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.868
(Roland scoffs)
- What?

06:40.901 --> 06:43.871
- No, I'm sorry, I just had
an image of you cooking.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.808
Come on, Johnny, you're talking
to a grill master.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.778
Do you know that I've been
given three different aprons

06:50.811 --> 06:52.546
because of my barbecue skills?

06:52.580 --> 06:54.782
Let's see,
I've got License to Grill,

06:54.815 --> 06:56.584
I've got Working Grill,

06:56.617 --> 06:58.752
oh and I have Grills
Just Wanna Have Fun.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.821
- It's gonna take more than
a license to grill

07:00.854 --> 07:02.556
to get this thing back to life.

07:02.590 --> 07:06.226
- Okay look, um, I can smell
your fear, okay?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.829
So why don't you go grab
the meat and the briquettes,

07:08.862 --> 07:10.998
and I'll get this bad boy
up and running for ya?

07:11.031 --> 07:13.233
- Okay well, thank you, Roland.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.968
And just so you're aware,

07:16.369 --> 07:18.639
this has nothing to do
with me not knowing my way
around a grill.

07:18.672 --> 07:22.543
I've watched many a personal
chef flip a burger in my day.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.578
- I've got the perfect apron
for ya,

07:24.612 --> 07:28.782
Poor Little Rich Grill.
(Laughs)

07:29.917 --> 07:32.085
I'll get it made up. (Laughs)

07:33.020 --> 07:36.790
♪♪♪

07:36.824 --> 07:38.592
(Quick footsteps thud)

07:42.195 --> 07:44.632
- I think so.
- I hope so.

07:44.665 --> 07:47.668
It would only be fair.
Please tell me yes.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.737
- Uh, hi.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.239
- David, someone's ears
must be a-flame.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.675
- When you said that you were
coming back,

07:54.708 --> 07:56.910
you just meant that
you weren't coming back,

07:56.944 --> 07:58.979
and that I would have to spend
the afternoon searching for you

07:59.012 --> 08:02.182
on the train tracks, and among
various unmarked vans.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.785
- You did that for me?

08:04.818 --> 08:07.855
- No, but there was a moment
when I thought about doing it.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.223
- David, blame me.
- Oh, I do.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.526
- Patrick was about to slip
away with the signatures

08:12.560 --> 08:14.828
when I corralled him into a
little lunchtime chin wag.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.297
- Yes, which is how I found out
about the barbecue

08:17.330 --> 08:20.601
that I was invited to,
but didn't know about.

08:20.634 --> 08:21.802
- Hmm.

08:23.303 --> 08:26.106
- Why didn't you tell me I was
invited to the barbecue?

08:26.139 --> 08:28.742
- Well, they only wanted to
have the barbecue

08:28.776 --> 08:31.244
after reading what
was on your cookie.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.914
- Yeah, sorry that still
sounds pretty nice to me.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.183
- Thank you, Pat.
- It is nice.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.987
No one's saying it's not nice.
What I'm saying is--

08:40.020 --> 08:42.022
- Yeah, okay.
- (Grunts)

08:42.055 --> 08:45.092
- Pat, do you mind giving us
the room for just a moment?

08:45.125 --> 08:46.293
- Certainly.
- Okay.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.562
- Somebody should probably be
at the store anyway, huh?

08:49.362 --> 08:50.831
Lovely talking to you,
Mrs. Rose.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.000
- You too.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.968
Wow.
(Door creak shut)

08:55.002 --> 08:57.004
- What are you doing?

08:57.037 --> 08:59.873
I told you I didn't want to
make a big deal out of this.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.843
- David you can't blame us
for being excited.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.211
Your father and I,

09:04.244 --> 09:06.647
we weren't involved in your
past relationships,

09:06.680 --> 09:09.650
and from what I understand it
was one bungle after another.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.318
I'm not saying
there's a connection.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.053
- There's no connection,

09:13.086 --> 09:16.156
it's just a long string
of very bad luck,

09:16.189 --> 09:17.925
and I don't know what kind
of carnage

09:17.958 --> 09:20.227
I inflicted in a past life,
to deserve it.

09:20.260 --> 09:24.665
I must've been... Dracula,
or a spin instructor.

09:26.667 --> 09:30.103
- And what if we could finally
tie a sailor's knot

09:30.137 --> 09:32.139
in that string of bad luck?

09:32.172 --> 09:35.175
Because after spending 5
minutes alone with sweet Pat,

09:35.208 --> 09:37.010
- We're not doing Pat.

09:37.044 --> 09:40.714
- He sees you.
For all that you are.

09:44.985 --> 09:49.189
- Well, hopefully not all that
I am, I mean that would be--

09:49.222 --> 09:52.626
- Oh, David, you have the
opportunity to climb out

09:52.660 --> 09:54.294
of the quicksand
that was your past,

09:54.327 --> 09:56.797
and stand firmly
in the present.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.132
Let us celebrate that.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.371
- (Sighs) Fine. He can come.

10:04.404 --> 10:05.338
- Excellent. And he's bringing
- (Sighs) Fine. He can come.
his guitar.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.140
- Excellent. And he's bringing
his guitar.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.976
- What?

10:09.009 --> 10:11.044
- Well, it was mostly his idea,
you know,

10:11.078 --> 10:12.846
in case there's a rousing
fireside sing-along?

10:12.880 --> 10:14.648
- No, I draw the line
at sing-along.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.653
(Birds chirping)

10:22.690 --> 10:24.758
- Whoa, geez, Louise.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.962
(Light taps)

10:28.996 --> 10:30.998
Alexis, hey.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.133
- Hey. I was in
the neighbourhood,

10:33.166 --> 10:36.003
so I thought I'd just pop in
and say hey.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.138
I was gonna send a text but um,

10:38.171 --> 10:40.407
I thought it'd be better
if I just came in.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.342
- I'm glad you did.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.778
- I'm also glad I did.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.981
- It's good to see you.
- It's also good to see you.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.987
Okay, well I just wanted
to say hey,

10:54.021 --> 10:58.258
and I'm here,
and I got your text.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.263
- What text?
- The text.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.766
- Did I send a text?

11:05.799 --> 11:09.002
- Maybe... no?

11:09.036 --> 11:12.439
Maybe you didn't. Did you?
I'm not sure.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.908
- What, uh, what'd it say?

11:14.942 --> 11:17.344
- Nothing. I don't think it
said anything,

11:17.377 --> 11:19.046
now that I think about it.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.414
Um... no something about you
being more of a bagel guy.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.116
- Oh my god,
did I send that to you?

11:23.150 --> 11:25.085
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh my gosh, I did.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.120
- Did you, though?
- I'm sorry,

11:27.154 --> 11:29.022
that wasn't supposed
to be sent to you.

11:29.056 --> 11:32.092
- Hello dummy,
why do you think I'm here?

11:32.125 --> 11:34.227
I'm here to tell you
to be careful

11:34.261 --> 11:37.831
because with those texts, those
texts in the wrong hands...

11:37.865 --> 11:39.767
- Yeah, it was actually
meant for Heather.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.434
- Heather, yes. Yes.

11:41.468 --> 11:44.972
You and Heath and the bagels.
- Yeah, she was just asking

11:45.005 --> 11:46.774
if she should pick up scones
or bagels.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.375
- Anyway, now we know.
Now we know.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.243
- You shoulda just texted.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.945
You didn't have to come
all the way down here.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.381
- Well no... um, as I was
saying, I was in the area.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.984
So, I just wanted to pop in
and see the look on your face

11:57.017 --> 11:58.886
when you realized
that you'd sent the text

11:58.919 --> 12:00.888
to the wrong person.
- Ooh.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.090
- (Fake squeal)
(Laughs)

12:04.191 --> 12:05.926
Um, hmm.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.796
- Um, hey I'm sorry
if I haven't been in touch

12:08.829 --> 12:12.099
as much recently.
- Oh my god, please. Please.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.768
Uh no, I should get outta
your hair.

12:14.802 --> 12:17.971
But it was good to see you,
Mr. Bagel. (Laughs)

12:18.005 --> 12:20.273
That's a you-and-Heather thing,

12:20.307 --> 12:22.142
but now that you texted me,

12:22.175 --> 12:24.244
it's kind of like an all-of-us
thing.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.980
So, have a great afternoon
today.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.983
(Door shuts)

12:30.017 --> 12:31.985
- Looking good, Roland!

12:32.019 --> 12:34.187
What time do you wanna
fire this baby up?

12:34.221 --> 12:37.390
- Uh, I dunno, probably about
an hour before you wanna eat.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.459
- Oh, well I was hoping
to eat around 8.

12:39.492 --> 12:42.429
- Where are we, Barcelona?
(Laughs)

12:42.462 --> 12:45.833
- Uh, well then 7.
- Yeah, 7 sounds better.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.101
- Honey, you ready to go?
- Yeah.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.970
- Wait, wait,
where are you going?

12:50.003 --> 12:51.905
- Oh, Jocelyn and I have
another one of those

12:51.939 --> 12:54.307
birthing rehearsals
we gotta go to.

12:54.341 --> 12:57.177
- I just bought $100
worth of sliders.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.846
- Geez Johnny,
thanks for rubbing it in

12:58.879 --> 13:01.348
when you know I can't come.
- You can't come?

13:01.381 --> 13:03.250
You didn't say you can't come!

13:03.283 --> 13:05.919
You were bragging
about being a grill master.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.355
- He really is. Did you tell
him about the aprons?

13:08.388 --> 13:10.457
- Yes he did!
And I was counting on him

13:10.490 --> 13:12.860
to do the grilling!

13:12.893 --> 13:14.361
- You know, Johnny,
maybe you should consider

13:14.394 --> 13:16.129
calling off the barbecue.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.965
- Well, I'm not calling it off!

13:17.998 --> 13:20.533
I just have to figure
this thing out.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.535
- Right, cut to
(Explosion sound)

13:22.569 --> 13:24.604
- Well, we're not cutting
to (Explosion sound).

13:24.637 --> 13:27.607
- Cut to, I've ruined my
sliders! (Laughs)

13:27.640 --> 13:30.443
Cut to, how does this thing
work? (Laughs)

13:34.147 --> 13:36.183
- See, this wasn't as hard
as you thought it was.

13:36.216 --> 13:39.286
- Mr. Rose, would you mind
taking a few steps back?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.388
- Oh, what you're gonna spray
the briquettes again?

13:41.421 --> 13:43.123
- Nope.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.425
- You guys want me to jump in?

13:45.458 --> 13:47.427
- No, I think we've got it
covered.

13:47.460 --> 13:51.398
- Oh, you do, oh great, 'cause
I'm gonna get another beer.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.333
- Hmm?
- There ya go.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.402
- All right.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.070
Well, finally.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.072
Back at the old grill.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.074
- I'd say that one looks
about perfect.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.443
- I was gonna say the same
thing.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.981
Specifically which one
were you talking about?

14:08.015 --> 14:10.617
- Just this one, here.
- Oh yeah, that's the one.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.020
- Okay, should I save him?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.587
- Oh they'll be fine.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.491
Let's just sit back
and enjoy the sight

14:18.525 --> 14:21.895
of our two strapping men
bonding over an open flame.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.297
Johnny: This one looks good,
is this one cooked?

14:26.033 --> 14:28.001
- Okay, so what else is new?
How's the shop?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.970
- Hmm, thriving.
- Yes.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.105
- Which is shocking because
as you may or may not know,

14:32.139 --> 14:34.107
I've struggled with group work
in the past.

14:34.141 --> 14:37.577
- David, you are living
an exciting new chapter

14:37.610 --> 14:40.013
in the book on tape
of your life.

14:40.047 --> 14:43.350
And you, you did this all
by yourself.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.585
- Okay, just so you know,

14:45.618 --> 14:47.587
that's not really a compliment,

14:47.620 --> 14:49.889
but thank you.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.963
- Oh my god, hey.
- Hi.

14:55.996 --> 14:59.566
- Um, so I took your advice,
which in retrospect is weird

14:59.599 --> 15:02.035
considering we like literally
just met.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.636
- Fair enough. And?

15:03.670 --> 15:06.039
- Turns out that text message
wasn't for me after all.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.340
- Oh.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.076
- His girlfriend was
at a bakery,

15:09.109 --> 15:11.444
hence the whole
"I prefer bagels thing".

15:11.478 --> 15:13.480
- Right.
So that girlfriend detail

15:13.513 --> 15:15.615
woulda been pretty useful
in the conversation

15:15.648 --> 15:18.251
we had earlier,
but still, I'm sorry.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.287
Oh, I feel somewhat
responsible.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.389
- Yeah, I can see that.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.391
It's just weird because like,

15:24.424 --> 15:26.493
I'm always the one being
chased.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.997
- I assumed that,
based on your face, and... body.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.398
- Right?

15:31.431 --> 15:34.001
- At least you got your answer.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.069
- You know what, Rach,
part of me feels like

15:36.103 --> 15:38.005
we were destined to meet today.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.107
- Well, that would make you
the one good thing

15:40.140 --> 15:41.708
to come outta my day.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.410
- Oh no.
- Yeah.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.378
To be honest, I came here
to win someone back,

15:45.412 --> 15:47.280
and it didn't happen.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.283
So, my big grand gesture
ends here.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.486
Sleeping alone
in some roadside motel.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.722
- Listen, it's not over yet.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.557
Why don't you come with me
to the barbecue

15:57.590 --> 15:59.392
that my parents are throwing?

15:59.426 --> 16:02.229
We can be each other's little...
little daties.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.064
- I would love that.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.698
Thank you.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.136
- That's it, watch your step.
- Yeah.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.470
- Okay, right, here. Perfect.

16:10.503 --> 16:14.474
Perfect. There ya go,
we make a good team, Pat.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.576
- No, John, no,
we're not doing Pat.

16:16.609 --> 16:17.577
- No we're not.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.379
- Okay, we're not waiting
for Alexis, are we?

16:20.380 --> 16:22.149
Because honestly,
I could eat this tablecloth.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.484
- Medium rare for David.
- Thank you.

16:24.517 --> 16:28.255
- You know um, this wasn't
actually the first time

16:28.288 --> 16:30.157
that I've been put to work
by the Rose family.

16:30.190 --> 16:35.228
My first job in high school
was actually at a Rose Video.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.299
- Get outta town! What branch?

16:39.332 --> 16:41.668
- 785.
- 785.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.770
Impressive late fees.
- Thank you.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.538
- Can you pass the ketchup,
please?

16:45.572 --> 16:49.142
- Okay, how did I not know that
you worked at a Rose Video?

16:49.176 --> 16:51.278
- Well, let's hope that you
continue

16:51.311 --> 16:52.712
to surprise each other.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.681
It keeps the relationship
titillating.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.683
- Okay, please never say
titillating

16:56.716 --> 16:58.485
when referring
to my relationship.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.387
- Oh, can I though?
- No.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.723
- Well, anyone with a glass,
please raise them.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.560
To relationships...

17:07.594 --> 17:09.429
old and new.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.365
(Approaching footsteps thud)

17:12.399 --> 17:14.801
- Um, thanks for waiting.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.803
- Alexis! Just in time!

17:16.836 --> 17:19.106
- Everybody, this is my new
friend Rachel,

17:19.139 --> 17:21.074
she's having a bit of a day.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.509
- Patrick?

17:22.542 --> 17:24.077
- Rachel, what are you
doing here?

17:25.345 --> 17:27.314
- What are you doing here? I've
been texting you for 2 days.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.417
- Wait, Patrick is your fiancé?

17:30.450 --> 17:33.320
- Uh, I'm sorry you
have a fiancée?

17:33.353 --> 17:36.489
- No I... I mean I don't... now.

17:36.523 --> 17:40.660
But yes, at some point
I mean, we... we were...

17:40.693 --> 17:43.296
- Patrick, what's going on here?

17:43.330 --> 17:45.765
- Okay, um, I just think
I might need a sec.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.500
- (Sighs) David.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.872
- I'm gonna talk to you
in a minute,

17:52.905 --> 17:55.175
we've got a lot to talk about.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.809
- Who is she?

17:56.843 --> 18:00.313
I glanced down at my plate
for two seconds.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.881
- (Sighs)

18:01.914 --> 18:03.683
(Door opens and shuts)

18:03.716 --> 18:05.885
David, I-I need to explain
a couple of things.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.255
- Um, what would be the main
one, do you think?

18:08.288 --> 18:10.323
- Rachel and I were engaged,

18:10.357 --> 18:12.259
but I called it off
before I moved here.

18:12.292 --> 18:15.395
- Okay, you know what, you
don't need to explain yourself.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.530
- I think...I think that I do.
- No, I know you do,

18:17.564 --> 18:19.466
that's just what I'm supposed
to be saying in the moment,

18:19.499 --> 18:21.734
so, please continue.
- Okay um,

18:21.768 --> 18:25.572
we got together when we were
in high school,

18:25.605 --> 18:27.807
and we've been on and off
ever since.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.444
I don't know we always just
sorta fell back into it.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.480
Anyway, she's been reaching out

18:33.513 --> 18:35.215
and expecting us
to get back together

18:35.248 --> 18:37.317
for the past few months.
- Whoa.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.552
Over the past few months?

18:39.586 --> 18:41.621
And you didn't think
to tell me about this?

18:41.654 --> 18:45.192
You stood in front of me
and told me to trust people.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.626
- I know.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.761
- When I was perfectly fine
not trusting people.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.364
Not trusting people
is what I'm used to.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.766
It is my comfort zone.
But next thing I know,

18:53.800 --> 18:56.603
there's an oversized cookie
on my doorstep,

18:56.636 --> 19:00.207
and you are telling me that
I have nothing to worry about.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.710
- I didn't want it to affect
what we have. Okay?

19:04.211 --> 19:06.413
And I mean it when I tell you

19:06.446 --> 19:07.314
that you have nothing
And I mean it when I tell you
to worry about.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.415
that you have nothing
to worry about.

19:09.349 --> 19:09.882
'Cause no matter how hard
I tried with her,

19:10.483 --> 19:12.352
it just never felt right.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.821
And up until recently,
I didn't understand why.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.292
David, I've spent most
of my life

19:19.326 --> 19:21.694
not knowing what right
was supposed to feel like,

19:21.728 --> 19:23.796
and then I met you.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.732
And everything changed.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.736
You make me feel right, David.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.707
- That is quite possibly one
of the most beautiful things

19:34.741 --> 19:37.277
I've ever heard anyone say.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.613
Um... outside of the
"Downton Christmas Special".

19:40.647 --> 19:42.915
- It's the truth.
- I know um...

19:42.949 --> 19:44.917
it's just that my truth

19:45.918 --> 19:49.322
is that I am damaged goods,

19:49.356 --> 19:53.626
and this has really messed
things up for me.

19:53.660 --> 19:57.630
And I think I need
some time with it.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.002
- All right.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.238
(Light receding footsteps)

20:06.406 --> 20:08.608
- Actually um,

20:08.641 --> 20:11.844
I haven't had dinner yet, so...

20:14.547 --> 20:16.449
- I'll grab ya a slider.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.387
- More than one, um,
and some potato salad,

20:20.420 --> 20:21.988
and I think there were some
other sides on the table,

20:22.021 --> 20:23.456
but I couldn't see,

20:23.490 --> 20:25.292
so maybe just a smattering
of everything.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.859
- Okay.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.696
(Emotional) Okay.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.598
(Door opens and closes)

20:35.768 --> 20:37.537
Woman on TV: I talked to Tommy
yesterday,

20:37.570 --> 20:39.539
he seemed very, very upset.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.474
- Okay, how long do you think
before I can go in there?

20:41.508 --> 20:43.910
- Well, I don't know,
he had 6 sliders.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.346
I'm assuming he'll be falling
asleep soon.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.814
- My poor baby.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.717
I told him he was out
of the quicksand,

20:50.750 --> 20:52.852
but he's not, John,
he's sinking.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.988
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.592
- Okay, don't get me wrong,
I feel super bad,

20:59.626 --> 21:01.994
and partially responsible
because I invited Rachel

21:02.028 --> 21:04.331
to the barbecue,
but at the same time,

21:04.364 --> 21:05.932
he's been watching that show
for 3 hours

21:05.965 --> 21:07.367
and my phone's in there.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.702
- Well, you might have to go
one night

21:09.736 --> 21:11.738
without your phone, Alexis.
- Ugh!

21:11.771 --> 21:13.506
(Knocks) David! David!

21:13.540 --> 21:16.008
Woman on TV: I know he will,
but what's gone so wrong

21:16.042 --> 21:18.478
between the two of you?

21:18.511 --> 21:21.013
What's so wrong that
it can't be patched up?

21:21.047 --> 21:22.982
You don't mean--
- Yes, it's true!
