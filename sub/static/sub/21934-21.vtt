WEBVTT

00:01.871 --> 00:03.742
Previously onScorpion...I actually just engineered

00:03.786 --> 00:05.440
this water filter.Tastes like home.

00:05.483 --> 00:07.529
If I can get one of these
to every West Altadenian,

00:07.572 --> 00:10.010
they would choose to use
tap water over bottled

00:10.053 --> 00:11.968
simply because of the taste.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.535
Look at her.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.058
Engaging the constituency
with science.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.539
How about you seize the moment
and ask her out already?

00:17.582 --> 00:18.975
I, uh...

00:19.019 --> 00:20.846
Do you have something
you want to tell me?

00:20.890 --> 00:22.848
You know what, I can't remember.

00:22.892 --> 00:25.416
Well, when you do,
you know where to find me.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.809
Having a baby

00:26.852 --> 00:28.767
means a lot of things
will be out of my control.

00:28.811 --> 00:31.379
That is a hard adjustment
to make, and I feel

00:31.422 --> 00:33.076
like I'm losing
a bit of my identity.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.296
Hey, Patty.
I made this for you.

00:35.339 --> 00:36.601
Cool. Thanks, kiddo.

00:37.341 --> 00:38.647
The UCLA event tonight,

00:38.690 --> 00:40.170
"Trigger Loop
as a Major Determinant

00:40.214 --> 00:41.476
"of Transcriptional Fidelity

00:41.519 --> 00:44.000
and Its Role in DNA Expression."

00:44.044 --> 00:45.828
RALPH:
It doesn't sound so bad.

00:45.871 --> 00:47.786
Yeah, well, I'd rather be at
the swamp with the alligators.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.397
WALTER:
Paige? Uh, bad news.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.007
The lecture was canceled.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.314
It's probably... for the best.

00:53.357 --> 00:54.793
[car door closes]I'm glad you could make it.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.099
I'm psyched.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.927
Well, let's go have
a stimulating evening.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.589
[motorcycle approaching]

01:09.243 --> 01:10.766
[tires screech]

01:10.809 --> 01:11.854
[engine revving]

01:13.464 --> 01:15.249
All right,
you can kill the engine.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.599
I get it,
you're on a motorcycle.

01:21.168 --> 01:22.386
I'm sorry, I missed that.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.345
What were you mumbling about?I said,

01:24.388 --> 01:25.650
you're smoking up my Sanka.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.043
Cool it.Sheesh.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.175
I'm just having some fun.

01:28.218 --> 01:30.002
We both know
that's not true.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.787
Oh, man, here we go.

01:31.830 --> 01:34.703
Now that you're not pregnant,
you are going buck wild

01:34.746 --> 01:36.270
doing all the things
you couldn't do

01:36.313 --> 01:37.532
when you thought
you were pregnant.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.577
You know, the Amish
have a word for this.

01:39.621 --> 01:41.362
It's called "rumspringa."I am not a teen

01:41.405 --> 01:43.103
sowing wild oats.

01:43.146 --> 01:45.540
I built up angst
during the fertility process,

01:45.583 --> 01:47.063
and I am letting off steam.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.021
You're doing wheelies
on the freeway.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.545
You're scuba diving at night.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.677
You're eating street meat
from that truck

01:52.721 --> 01:54.592
under the freeway.
That's just dangerous.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.028
You worry too much.

01:56.072 --> 01:58.074
So did I. Maybe that's
why the pregnancy

01:58.118 --> 01:59.467
didn't take.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.556
Wheelies could help our chances.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.035
We're trying again
in a few months,

02:03.079 --> 02:05.429
and it might help our chances
if you do not die.

02:05.473 --> 02:07.649
WALTER: Speaking
of dying,

02:07.692 --> 02:09.694
I have a diagnosis, Toby.

02:11.957 --> 02:14.482
I'm fatigued. Listless. Anxious.

02:14.525 --> 02:15.918
And according to

02:15.961 --> 02:17.920
Harrison's Principles
of Internal Medicine,

02:17.963 --> 02:20.531
I have Lyme disease.Hmm.

02:20.575 --> 02:23.055
Let's take a look.
Let's see here.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.146
Pupils are normal.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.714
Pulse is regular.

02:29.758 --> 02:31.673
Head's inflated.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.457
Nothing about you has changed.

02:33.501 --> 02:34.806
Then why do I feel so bad?

02:34.850 --> 02:37.157
You don't have Lyme disease.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.246
You got lying disease.

02:39.289 --> 02:40.899
You feel guilty
for lying to Paige

02:40.943 --> 02:43.163
about going
to that lecture with Flo.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.774
Now your psychological pain,
it's manifesting physically.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.515
There are solutions.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.386
A: Tell her the truth.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.953
TOBY:
Yeah.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.607
It would relive your pain,
but that would hurt her.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.696
So then I-I shouldn't tell her.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.654
Well, that's "B,"
which would spare her pain

02:56.698 --> 02:57.568
but prolong yours.

02:57.612 --> 02:59.614
That is quite the conundrum.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.616
See, this is why I never lie.

03:01.659 --> 03:02.747
You just did it right there.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.445
That being said,
you got to game it out

03:04.488 --> 03:05.533
and decide what to do.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.752
An emotional equation?

03:07.796 --> 03:09.667
A decision chart.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.365
Two columns.

03:11.408 --> 03:12.888
Tell her.

03:12.931 --> 03:14.629
Don't tell her.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.805
And the side with
the most entries

03:16.848 --> 03:18.372
dictates which course

03:18.415 --> 03:21.201
I choose.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.811
Whatever, man.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.378
In the meantime,

03:24.421 --> 03:25.814
should I keep sending her gifts?

03:25.857 --> 03:27.207
What gifts?

03:27.250 --> 03:30.253
"Power Ma-Saw-Ger"?

03:30.297 --> 03:31.907
I don't want this thing. How
much more crap is he sending?

03:31.950 --> 03:33.604
Ma'am, like I've explained,

03:33.648 --> 03:35.606
Skyhigh Buys keeps a
limited number of items

03:35.650 --> 03:37.217
on plane for onboard delivery,

03:37.260 --> 03:38.609
but it doesn't allow
for returns.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.524
Enjoy your massager.

03:40.568 --> 03:43.571
Why is Walter sending
me this junk?

03:43.614 --> 03:45.877
Gift-giving releases dopamine,

03:45.921 --> 03:47.618
triggering sensations
of pleasure.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.054
Too bad
I couldn't give Patty one

03:49.098 --> 03:51.274
at her birthday party.Get over it.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.580
And you got to go to Hawaii.

03:52.623 --> 03:54.321
We saw a volcano.

03:54.364 --> 03:55.670
At least I did.

03:55.713 --> 03:56.627
You were on your phone
the whole time

03:56.671 --> 03:57.715
looking at party posts.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.500
Drowning in FOMO.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.197
That's "fear of missing out."

04:01.241 --> 04:03.591
I know what FOMO is.

04:04.766 --> 04:06.681
You shouldn't
have made me miss it.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.596
Look how much fun she had.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.641
Toby says a festive mood

04:10.685 --> 04:12.077
makes people receptive
to new ideas.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.383
Such as?

04:15.429 --> 04:16.647
Asking her out?

04:16.691 --> 04:18.083
You're 13.

04:18.127 --> 04:19.563
Exactly.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.696
It's time we took our
relationship to the next level.

04:21.739 --> 04:23.741
Do what the big kids do.

04:23.785 --> 04:25.874
You don't mean...

04:25.917 --> 04:26.962
Yes.

04:28.224 --> 04:30.226
Movies and go-karting.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.402
Serious stuff.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.754
Look, I know you like Patty,
but there's too big of a gap

04:36.798 --> 04:39.627
between you.I'm willing to overlook her IQ.

04:39.670 --> 04:40.671
Age gap.

04:40.715 --> 04:43.065
I'm sorry. This is
what parents do.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.196
They protect their kids.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.546
This may be tough
for a little bit,

04:45.589 --> 04:46.764
but it'll smooth out.

04:49.027 --> 04:50.420
[passengers gasp, exclaim]

04:50.464 --> 04:52.422
Whoa, hold tight. [chuckles]

04:52.466 --> 04:55.033
So, I was saying
the fish-finder I used

04:55.077 --> 04:56.557
might have located the tuna,

04:56.600 --> 04:58.689
but I hauled her in.

04:58.733 --> 05:01.518
My back is still barking
like a terrier.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.955
You can't imagine
what it's like

05:03.999 --> 05:07.002
to endure something
so long and grueling.

05:07.045 --> 05:09.091
Actually, I can.

05:09.134 --> 05:12.312
Excuse me, Morty.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.792
How you doing, pal?

05:16.446 --> 05:19.188
Grip tight enough
on those armrests?

05:19.231 --> 05:21.451
Thanks to the turbulence,
our odds of crashing

05:21.495 --> 05:23.061
have increased
from one in 1.2 million

05:23.105 --> 05:24.411
to one in one million.

05:24.454 --> 05:25.977
We've already crashed once.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.892
What are the odds
we're gonna crash again?

05:27.936 --> 05:29.198
Oh!

05:29.241 --> 05:30.982
Increasing.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.810
See? Look on the radar.

05:32.854 --> 05:33.855
There's a storm coming up.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.030
A storm that the pilots

05:35.073 --> 05:38.381
are aware of
and are going to avoid.

05:38.425 --> 05:39.687
You got to think positive.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.384
Your pitch went well.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.604
The Navy brass, they like
your water filtration system.

05:43.647 --> 05:45.432
PAIGE: Maybe this
will help you relax.

05:45.475 --> 05:48.609
I was happy to accept Walter's
upgrade to business class,

05:48.652 --> 05:49.914
but these gifts
are getting ridiculous.

05:49.958 --> 05:52.395
Thank you. I will try anything

05:52.439 --> 05:54.571
to help soothe my nerves.

05:54.615 --> 05:55.485
[buzzing loudly]

05:55.529 --> 05:57.357
This is not soothing!

05:57.400 --> 05:58.488
No.

05:58.532 --> 05:59.663
No onboard returns.

05:59.707 --> 06:02.013
And Ralph wants you
to check out page 44

06:02.057 --> 06:04.146
in the in-flight magazine.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.239
"Destination: Her Heart"?

06:10.282 --> 06:12.415
Is the kid counseling you?

06:12.459 --> 06:13.677
[scoffs]

06:13.721 --> 06:15.200
You got a crush?Yeah.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.680
On a woman named Nunya.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.421
Last name, Business.

06:18.465 --> 06:19.553
It's Florence.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.860
I wear bifocals to read menus.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.035
Doesn't mean I'm blind.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.255
I can actually

06:26.298 --> 06:27.996
see you two working out.

06:28.039 --> 06:30.172
I tried to ask her out,
but I fumbled it.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.217
Megan, she was
one in a billion.

06:32.261 --> 06:33.480
She understood me.

06:33.523 --> 06:34.742
She accepted me, loved me.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.787
My anxiety and all.

06:38.180 --> 06:41.618
So the odds
of finding that again are...

06:41.662 --> 06:44.012
astronomical.

06:44.055 --> 06:46.667
I figure it's just futile.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.582
I wouldn't let your head
get in the way of your heart.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.627
Flo's a good egg.

06:50.671 --> 06:53.674
Little tightly wound,
but she's a good kid.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.458
You should ask her out already.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.807
She is intelligent

06:56.851 --> 06:57.895
and kind.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.201
Odd.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.464
Yes, that, too,
but that's part of her charm.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.900
No, the air marshal.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.598
She's acting odd.

07:04.641 --> 07:05.903
How do you know
she's an air marshal?

07:05.947 --> 07:07.165
I'm Homeland.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.558
I made her when we boarded.

07:09.733 --> 07:10.908
She just unbuttoned her coat

07:10.952 --> 07:12.823
to get to her gun faster.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.783
Well, maybe she's just warm.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.785
CABE: Now she's
talking to the pilot.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.569
No, there's
definitely something up.

07:19.613 --> 07:20.831
Let me up.

07:23.355 --> 07:26.054
Just when I thought this flight
couldn't get any worse.

07:26.097 --> 07:28.839
So, did your friend tell you
about my tuna haul?

07:28.883 --> 07:30.537
You know, in Hawaii,

07:30.580 --> 07:34.149
they call them mahi-mahi.
[chuckles]

07:34.192 --> 07:35.585
I'll-I'll start over.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.935
So, I hadn't had
so much as a nibble.

07:37.979 --> 07:40.503
You made me
from back of the plane, huh?

07:40.547 --> 07:42.505
Guess I need to work

07:42.549 --> 07:44.594
on my poker face.
Marshal Kayla Kakua.

07:44.638 --> 07:45.726
This is Captain Dan Drake.

07:45.769 --> 07:47.162
So, what gives?

07:47.205 --> 07:49.860
During takeoff, a brake
warning light turned on.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.515
Now, it went off right away,
so we figured no issue.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.256
But a few minutes ago,
the nav system picked up

07:54.299 --> 07:55.953
a rogue cell phone signal
that just turned on.

07:55.997 --> 07:57.868
Passenger turned on
their cell phone?

07:57.912 --> 07:59.740
KAYLA: The signal's coming
from the cargo hold.

07:59.783 --> 08:01.393
It could be a phone
in someone's luggage

08:01.437 --> 08:03.874
that got jostled by turbulence
and accidentally turned on.

08:03.918 --> 08:06.747
But it could also be
a triggering device.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.836
You think you got a bomb
on this plane?

08:08.879 --> 08:10.098
KAYLA:
Possibly.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.926
I need to go through
every piece of luggage

08:11.969 --> 08:13.405
in that cargo hold fast.

08:13.449 --> 08:14.755
Just not sure how,

08:14.798 --> 08:16.757
given that there's over 400 bags
down there.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.063
I got just the team
that can help you.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.543
There's one of them.

08:20.587 --> 08:23.546
He's a genius.

08:23.590 --> 08:24.939
So sorry.

08:24.982 --> 08:27.768
Most of the time.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.552
Everyone's comm in?

08:29.596 --> 08:31.467
Yeah. Pilot has one, too.
Cabe got us up to speed.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.729
Some flight.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.644
What's next, locusts?

08:34.688 --> 08:36.080
TOBY: Guys, we got
a lot of work to do,

08:36.124 --> 08:37.821
but we need to do it real quiet.

08:37.865 --> 08:40.868
Overall attentiveness
is up over 40% on planes,

08:40.911 --> 08:42.565
'cause even the best fliers
are on alert

08:42.609 --> 08:44.306
when they're 36,000 feet
in the air.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.569
You give off fear markers,
you could get panic,

08:46.613 --> 08:48.571
and things could get real bad
real fast.

08:48.615 --> 08:49.877
To pinpoint the bomb's location,

08:49.920 --> 08:52.575
you'll need to fabricate
a DVT antenna.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.577
All you'll need
is aluminum foil,

08:54.621 --> 08:55.970
cardboard and copper wire.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.145
KAYLA:
From where?

08:57.188 --> 08:58.799
Not like we can stop
and get supplies.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.104
Due to my fear of flying,

09:00.148 --> 09:02.237
I have read every book there is
on airplanes,

09:02.280 --> 09:03.934
and I know that there are miles

09:03.978 --> 09:05.632
of copper wire
in these death traps.

09:05.675 --> 09:07.590
The forward galley's got a panel

09:07.634 --> 09:08.983
for the flight attendant
call buttons

09:09.026 --> 09:09.984
where you can rip some out.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.855
I'll show you.

09:11.899 --> 09:13.074
I can get foil from
the food prep area.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.554
Ralph, go ask the
flight attendant

09:14.597 --> 09:15.946
for one of those coloring
books they give the kids.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.557
It'll have cardboard backing.Sure.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.733
I'll just act like a kid
who enjoys coloring books

09:19.776 --> 09:21.604
instead of quantum physics.

09:21.648 --> 09:24.302
Why don't you just
push me around in a stroller?

09:25.347 --> 09:27.567
HAPPY:
I can walk you through

09:27.610 --> 09:29.960
the defusing process
only if you find the bomb.

09:30.004 --> 09:32.441
Airlines customize
their cargo holds--

09:32.484 --> 09:33.790
they're like
mazes down there.

09:33.834 --> 09:34.965
We'll need more than just
manufacturer schematics.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.881
How about an exact replica
of the plane?

09:37.925 --> 09:40.014
FAA has a real-time
location system

09:40.057 --> 09:42.494
that shows North Island Air

09:42.538 --> 09:43.757
has a twin FL 425 plane

09:43.800 --> 09:46.237
by Hangar 29
that is grounded for repairs.

09:46.281 --> 09:48.588
We could go.
Uh, call Homeland for clearance?

09:48.631 --> 09:49.980
Yeah, I'll monitor everything
from here.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.286
Great.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.468
I'm gathering data.

09:59.511 --> 10:00.774
That plane's not the only thing

10:00.817 --> 10:02.645
that could go down in flames.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.038
What's this for?

10:04.081 --> 10:05.866
It's to protect the empty space
between your ears.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.345
We'll split lanes,
we'll get there faster.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.912
Let's go. Lives are at stake.

10:08.956 --> 10:11.045
I couldn't agree more.
Ourlives.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.483
SYLVESTER:
Clear.

10:14.526 --> 10:17.529
That thing looks like
a fourth grade science project.

10:17.573 --> 10:18.879
You sure it works?

10:18.922 --> 10:20.315
Absolutely.

10:20.358 --> 10:21.925
In 2009, TV stations

10:21.969 --> 10:24.885
stopped broadcasting
analog signals.

10:24.928 --> 10:27.583
DVT antennas
like this one

10:27.627 --> 10:30.020
were invented to pick
up on digital signals.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.109
We're just using this one to
pick up a cell signal instead.

10:32.153 --> 10:33.633
Clear.

10:40.378 --> 10:43.077
[beeping]Whoa...

10:43.120 --> 10:45.035
The signal is spiking.

10:45.079 --> 10:46.820
That must mean
there's a bomb in there.

10:46.863 --> 10:49.126
Step back.

11:01.399 --> 11:02.749
Ugly shirts,

11:02.792 --> 11:04.098
khakis and tube socks.

11:04.141 --> 11:05.708
What is that-- your bag?

11:05.752 --> 11:07.188
Shut it.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.190
Bag's clean. No bomb.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.932
[beeping]

11:11.975 --> 11:13.760
I'm still getting a signal.
Check underneath it.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.943
Nothing.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.596
And the container's flush
with the plane floor.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.555
WALTER:
So the bomb must be
under the plane.

11:26.598 --> 11:29.079
You're directly over the wheel
well. It has to be in there.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.341
But how can we know for sure?

11:30.385 --> 11:32.169
Not like we have X-ray vision.

11:32.213 --> 11:35.303
Actually, we do.

11:37.392 --> 11:38.872
How'd you know
the guy sitting next to you

11:38.915 --> 11:40.090
was carrying a fish finder?

11:40.134 --> 11:43.180
It's a long story. Literally.

11:43.224 --> 11:46.096
SYLVESTER:
I've programmed the sonar
to send us two quick pulses.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.402
The second is
phase inverted,

11:47.445 --> 11:49.839
so we should be able
to see a rough image...

11:49.883 --> 11:52.102
now.

11:52.146 --> 11:54.670
Son of a...
That's not a bomb.

11:54.714 --> 11:58.108
It's a person, and from
the size, I think it's a kid!

12:02.504 --> 12:04.506
♪

12:13.471 --> 12:14.734
A stowaway?

12:14.777 --> 12:16.039
SYLVESTER:
Probably the only person

12:16.083 --> 12:17.780
who's hated this flight
more than I have.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.434
Signal must be coming
from their cell phone.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.610
Probably passed out
from exposure,

12:21.653 --> 12:22.916
turned it on to call for help.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.526
But there's no reception
at this altitude.

12:24.569 --> 12:25.788
CABE:
Look. They're moving.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.398
They're alive.

12:27.442 --> 12:30.271
Out of 113 recorded attempts
of plane stowaways,

12:30.314 --> 12:31.576
86 have died.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.970
That's a 76% fatality rate.

12:34.014 --> 12:36.320
Not to mention the ones that
have gone unreported since,

12:36.364 --> 12:39.410
when the landing gear opens,
stowaways would fall

12:39.454 --> 12:42.065
to their deaths, sometimes
over open water, never found.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.414
Thanks for the pick-me-up.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.764
Start thinking positive!

12:44.807 --> 12:46.069
DRAKE:
How would someone

12:46.113 --> 12:48.419
get into the wheel well
in the first place?

12:48.463 --> 12:49.856
WALTER:
Well, I hacked security footage

12:49.899 --> 12:51.422
of the
Kailua International Airport

12:51.466 --> 12:53.076
just before the flight took off.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.035
And cameras caught a boy
sneaking onto the tarmac

12:55.078 --> 12:56.253
and up to the plane.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.386
Also found
a missing persons report issued

12:58.429 --> 13:01.955
by the Honolulu Police for a
13-year-old named Kenny Layton.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.348
DRAKE:
Scanning passenger manifest.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.177
Right here.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.483
There's a Joseph Layton,

13:08.526 --> 13:11.791
45, in seat 27E.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.401
Probably his dad.
I'll tell him what's happening.

13:13.444 --> 13:15.446
We need to figure out a way
to get Kenny out of there.

13:15.490 --> 13:16.926
Happy, you at
the twin plane yet?

13:16.970 --> 13:18.798
[Toby screaming]

13:18.841 --> 13:20.974
[tires screech]

13:21.017 --> 13:21.975
We're here.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.586
Made it faster
than expected!

13:24.629 --> 13:27.067
Might need to change my pants.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.372
Okay, stop whining

13:28.416 --> 13:30.026
and tell them
what you told me.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.028
Guys, after four
hours of exposure

13:32.072 --> 13:33.943
to the elements at
that high altitude,

13:33.987 --> 13:35.771
Kenny will have hypoxia.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.947
It's also negative 60 degrees
up there,

13:37.991 --> 13:39.601
so he's gonna have hypothermia.

13:39.644 --> 13:43.126
We're gonna need to get him heat
and oxygen, stat, and Sly,

13:43.170 --> 13:44.693
sync your tablet to my phone

13:44.736 --> 13:45.955
so I can keep track of this kid.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.391
Well, there's a simple solution.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.785
Descend to 5,000 feet
where it's 41 degrees

13:49.829 --> 13:51.613
and there's more breathable air.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.528
Kenny will warm up
and get more oxygen.

13:53.571 --> 13:54.834
We've done it before.Yes.

13:54.877 --> 13:57.445
Right before we crashed
into a deserted island!

13:57.488 --> 13:58.881
Well, hopefully,
this will end better.

13:58.925 --> 14:01.710
Okay. At 5,000 feet, the
air pressure inside and outside

14:01.753 --> 14:03.712
of the plane will
be equivalent, so you could

14:03.755 --> 14:06.497
cut through the aluminum floor
into the wheel well

14:06.541 --> 14:08.456
and pull Kenny out
without risking the whole plane

14:08.499 --> 14:11.415
undergoing explosive
decompression and crashing.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.548
We could use the Power
Ma-Saw-Ger that Paige gave me.

14:13.591 --> 14:14.505
Paige, you regifted

14:14.549 --> 14:15.724
my massager?

14:15.767 --> 14:17.465
Um... yeah.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.032
It practically drilled a hole
in my leg.

14:19.075 --> 14:21.077
All we have to do is
attach a blade to it.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.513
You're on a flight
from Hawaii,

14:22.557 --> 14:24.951
one of the most popular
scuba-diving spots on Earth.

14:24.994 --> 14:28.128
Divers keep knives
to cut loose in emergencies.

14:28.171 --> 14:30.913
One of the bags had a "diver
down" symbol. We'll find it.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.480
HAPPY:
And I will call L.A. air traffic

14:32.523 --> 14:36.701
to clear a runway
for a rapid descent.

14:36.745 --> 14:39.052
I can't believe he'd do this.
We have to get him out of there.

14:39.095 --> 14:40.531
No, no, no. I know you are
scared for your son,

14:40.575 --> 14:42.577
but the best thing to do
for him is to stay calm.

14:42.620 --> 14:45.319
Do not alarm the other
passengers, sit tight.

14:45.362 --> 14:48.496
I'm part of an incredible team
that's working to save him.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.541
The wheel well? Why would he do
such a crazy thing?

14:50.585 --> 14:53.457
You said his mom's in Honolulu,
and you live in L.A.?

14:53.501 --> 14:55.068
Yeah. We divorced a-a year ago.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.418
She got a job in the islands
and moved there with Kenny.

14:57.461 --> 14:58.767
I just visited him this week.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.596
He told me he wanted
to move back to L.A. with me,

15:01.639 --> 15:03.467
but I didn't know
he was so determined.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.339
Kids this age often are.

15:05.382 --> 15:06.949
I know all about it.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.778
Yuck!

15:09.821 --> 15:11.214
It's still wet.

15:11.258 --> 15:12.868
Don't scuba divers
know about mold?

15:12.912 --> 15:14.043
Found it!

15:14.087 --> 15:15.958
Okay.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.918
I'll have the power saw built
and ready to cut Kenny out

15:18.961 --> 15:20.963
by the time the plane descends
to 5,000 feet.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.138
DRAKE:
About that...

15:22.182 --> 15:23.270
Storm's getting worse.

15:23.313 --> 15:24.532
We have to fully pass over it

15:24.575 --> 15:26.186
before we can safely descend.

15:26.229 --> 15:27.665
It'll take about a half hour.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.971
TOBY:
No! Kenny could be

15:29.015 --> 15:30.755
dead by then.
His movement is slowing down,

15:30.799 --> 15:32.279
which means
his vitals are slowing down!

15:32.322 --> 15:34.542
I have the greatest sympathy
for the boy's predicament,

15:34.585 --> 15:36.022
but this is a full plane.

15:36.065 --> 15:38.981
We can't lose 200 lives
to save one.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.243
Then we keep Kenny alive

15:40.287 --> 15:42.245
until we can safely descend
and cut him out.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.987
Now, he'll need oxygen and heat,
so how do we get that to him?

15:45.031 --> 15:46.597
SYLVESTER:
Another thing I know

15:46.641 --> 15:49.470
from my crippling, yet clearly
justified, fear of flying--

15:49.513 --> 15:52.864
emergency oxygen on planes
doesn't come from tanks.

15:52.908 --> 15:55.041
Overhead compartments
have chemicals

15:55.084 --> 15:57.739
that create oxygen
via exothermic reaction.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.697
Well, we can use that oxygen
to keep Kenny alive

15:59.741 --> 16:02.091
if we can create a delivery
system to get it to him. Now,

16:02.135 --> 16:04.398
Happy, anything in the wheel
well that could do the trick?

16:04.441 --> 16:06.661
Only one way to find out.Hey. Hey, hey.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.924
Happy, there's lots of sharp
edges in there. It's dangerous.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.666
It's just like the rock climbing
we did the other day.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.973
Yeah,
and that was dangerous, too!

16:15.626 --> 16:17.802
I see built-in
fire extinguishers.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.195
What are those connected to?

16:19.239 --> 16:20.718
[Toby screams]

16:20.762 --> 16:22.807
Halon. There should be tanks
of it in the cargo hold.

16:23.852 --> 16:26.028
All right, got 'em. Now what?

16:26.072 --> 16:28.074
Replace the halon
with the sodium chlorate

16:28.117 --> 16:30.946
and iron powder
from the oxygen-creating systems

16:30.990 --> 16:32.774
to induce
the exothermic reaction.

16:32.817 --> 16:35.211
I understood everything
up to "replace."

16:35.255 --> 16:37.039
Overhead compartments,
green canisters. Go get 'em!

16:37.083 --> 16:39.041
That's more like it.
Marshal, come with me.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.000
All right.I'm disconnecting
the halon tanks.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.131
HAPPY:
So we can use

16:42.175 --> 16:44.351
those fire extinguishers
to pump oxygen

16:44.394 --> 16:47.745
into the wheel well.This space would make
anyone feel claustrophobic.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.791
Guys, we're gonna
need a way

16:49.834 --> 16:52.228
to talk with Kenny
so we can calm his nerves

16:52.272 --> 16:53.795
and stabilize him
once he regains consciousness.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.405
WALTER:
There's no cell service,

16:55.449 --> 16:57.059
but if Ralph can
find a Wi-Fi node...

16:57.103 --> 16:58.191
I'll access the node
and reconfigure it

16:58.234 --> 16:59.801
to connect my phone
with Kenny's.

16:59.844 --> 17:02.412
I'll want my comm connected
to my phone, too, so I'll have

17:02.456 --> 17:04.936
to reboot it and be out of
communication for a few minutes.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.113
I see a node.
Talk to you soon.

17:08.636 --> 17:09.724
[beeps]

17:09.767 --> 17:11.030
TOBY:
Kenny won't be talking to anyone

17:11.073 --> 17:12.683
if we don't find a way
to warm him up fast.

17:12.727 --> 17:13.641
He's freezing to death.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.034
Then de-ice him.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.861
The de-icing system
sends warm air

17:16.905 --> 17:19.603
along the wings to the tires,
so if they freeze,

17:19.647 --> 17:21.562
they can be heated
before landing.

17:21.605 --> 17:22.650
Yeah. That air would
warm up Kenny, too.

17:22.693 --> 17:23.738
DRAKE:
One problem.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.305
De-icing system
has a governor

17:25.348 --> 17:27.089
that shuts off
after eight minutes.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.438
I can't override it.

17:28.482 --> 17:29.831
WALTER:
It can be done manually

17:29.874 --> 17:31.354
from the master panel
above the ceiling

17:31.398 --> 17:32.747
of the portside restroom.

17:32.790 --> 17:33.835
I'm closest. I can do it.

17:33.878 --> 17:35.097
I'll help.
No.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.143
I got this. Trust me.
It's what we do.

17:37.186 --> 17:40.668
Walter, while Ralph's comm is
shut down, and we have a moment,

17:40.711 --> 17:41.625
I need a favor.

17:41.669 --> 17:42.844
Is everything okay?

17:42.887 --> 17:44.585
Ralph's upset
that I made him miss

17:44.628 --> 17:45.716
Patty's party.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.240
He needs someone
to talk to who isn't me.

17:47.283 --> 17:48.719
Besides, I know way too much
about his crush.

17:48.763 --> 17:51.244
Ignorance really would be bliss.

17:51.287 --> 17:54.769
So, you are saying,
if given the choice,

17:54.812 --> 17:57.380
you would prefer
to remain ignorant

17:57.424 --> 17:59.034
of disturbing information?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.731
Yeah, I guess so.
Just take him for a milkshake

18:00.775 --> 18:03.125
and talk to him.
Okay, I need

18:03.169 --> 18:05.171
to find the governor.

18:09.218 --> 18:12.656
I got your sodium chlorate
and iron powder mix.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.789
[grunting]

18:15.790 --> 18:17.139
All right,
help me connect 'em.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.141
[grunts]

18:19.185 --> 18:21.230
Here are the rest!

18:23.232 --> 18:25.408
My cell's connected
to the Wi-Fi node.

18:25.452 --> 18:27.976
I'm ready to call Kenny.
Say the word.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.847
TOBY:
You can't call him.
He's not moving.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.022
Get him the O2 now.

18:31.066 --> 18:33.112
Turning on
the fire extinguishers now.

18:33.155 --> 18:34.461
[whooshing]

18:37.028 --> 18:38.813
He's not moving.
Bring the heat.

18:38.856 --> 18:42.382
Found the governor.
I'm switching it off.

18:42.425 --> 18:43.905
Activating de-icing system.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.431
Okay, hot air is going
to the wheel well.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.912
He's still not moving.
I think we're too late.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.348
Well, it takes a while
for the heat to take effect.

18:52.392 --> 18:53.871
SYLVESTER:
He's got hot air

18:53.915 --> 18:56.135
being blown directly on him
in a very confined space.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.745
He's not reacting to it at all.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.181
TOBY:
Not so fast.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.488
He moved!
We got a live one.

19:01.531 --> 19:02.750
Ralph, ring him up.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.621
Already dialing.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.667
[phone ringing]

19:14.936 --> 19:16.067
Hello?

19:16.111 --> 19:19.201
Kenny, my name's Ralph.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.942
You're looped in
with Team Scorpion,

19:20.985 --> 19:22.552
the geniuses who are
going to save your life.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.206
Huh?

19:24.250 --> 19:25.512
We'll explain later.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.209
The key is, we're gonna
get you out of there.

19:27.253 --> 19:28.732
I just need you
to stay calm and cool.

19:28.776 --> 19:29.951
Can you do that?

19:29.994 --> 19:33.737
Cool? I'm already... freezing.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.435
He's got a sense of humor.
That's a good sign.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.393
Can I talk to my...?RALPH:
Interference.

19:37.437 --> 19:39.961
Spotty reception's inevitable
with a jerry-rigged system.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.441
Hi. Kenny, my name's Walter.

19:41.484 --> 19:42.833
Can you move any higher
in there?

19:42.877 --> 19:44.922
It'll give you
a better connection.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.750
Uh... yeah, I'll try.

19:51.059 --> 19:53.366
Okay, I might have found
a way up.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.891
Ah! No.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.327
What was that?KENNY:
I think

19:58.371 --> 19:59.807
I stepped on a wire.WALTER:
It must have become

19:59.850 --> 20:01.461
dislodged when he crawled
into the wheel well.

20:01.504 --> 20:02.984
We couldn't have known
it was loose,

20:03.027 --> 20:04.246
but now there is
a short circuit.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.030
Oh, not good.
Why?

20:06.074 --> 20:09.251
It's getting smoky in here!
[panting]

20:09.295 --> 20:11.210
That's why.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.821
[coughing]

20:13.864 --> 20:16.389
The short circuits must have
started a fire in the engine.

20:16.432 --> 20:19.435
[loud, panicked chatter]

20:23.091 --> 20:24.788
Oh, boy.

20:26.877 --> 20:29.358
Okay, Captain, cut
the engine's electrical supply.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.795
Can't. System's not responding
due to the short.

20:31.839 --> 20:32.927
CABE:
Is there any other way

20:32.970 --> 20:34.929
to put the fire out?HAPPY: Negative.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.974
And there's
barely any ventilation
in these wheel wells.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.846
Guys, we need
to stop that smoke, or Kenny

20:38.889 --> 20:40.500
won't last another four minutes.[coughing]

20:52.338 --> 20:53.948
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Drake.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.297
You may have spotted some smoke

20:55.341 --> 20:57.212
coming
from the starboard side engine.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.997
We have
a minor mechanical malfunction,

21:00.041 --> 21:01.738
and we'll be shutting it down
now.

21:01.782 --> 21:04.219
But not to worry,
this plane flies very capably

21:04.263 --> 21:05.829
on one engine.

21:05.873 --> 21:08.745
We'll have you on the
ground in L.A. very soon.

21:11.052 --> 21:13.663
Captain, kill the shorted
engine. What's the delay?

21:13.707 --> 21:15.317
I can't shut it off.
The short has made

21:15.361 --> 21:16.927
the starboard engine
unresponsive.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.625
It'll continue to run,
feed the fire

21:18.668 --> 21:20.409
and create smoke
until it runs out of fuel.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.324
I can't...
[coughing]

21:22.368 --> 21:23.760
I can't breathe!

21:23.804 --> 21:25.153
RALPH:
Get as low as possible.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.285
Smoke's lighter
than the surrounding air,

21:26.328 --> 21:27.286
so it'll rise up.

21:27.329 --> 21:28.852
[coughs]
I'll try.

21:28.896 --> 21:30.332
[coughing]

21:30.376 --> 21:31.507
Quick thinking.

21:31.551 --> 21:33.292
You bought us
some extra time.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.424
Well, not a lot!
Kenny's got minutes

21:35.468 --> 21:37.296
before he succumbs
to smoke inhalation.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.993
Can't you dump fuel
or something?

21:39.036 --> 21:40.255
Short's knocked down
all the controls

21:40.299 --> 21:41.952
on the starboard side
of the plane.

21:41.996 --> 21:42.953
We're fenced off.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.433
A fence. That could do it.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.174
We don't have
to dump the fuel.

21:46.217 --> 21:48.045
We need to stop it
from getting to the engine.

21:48.089 --> 21:50.178
We can't do it from
the plane's controls, but...

21:50.221 --> 21:51.353
We can do it manually.

21:51.397 --> 21:54.225
Pulling up
the plane's fuel plans now.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.227
Business class galley.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.968
There's a valve behind
its cabinets that, if turned,

21:58.012 --> 21:59.970
should cut off the fuel
to the engine.

22:00.014 --> 22:01.755
[passengers clamoring]

22:01.798 --> 22:03.409
The passengers
are getting worried.

22:03.452 --> 22:04.410
What should I tell them?

22:04.453 --> 22:05.933
Basic mechanical issues.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.978
Tell 'em we work for
the airlines. Everything's cool.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.286
All right.
Let's find that valve.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.548
Copy that.

22:14.289 --> 22:15.377
Nuts!

22:16.509 --> 22:18.162
Look out.

22:20.469 --> 22:21.905
SYLVESTER:
That's the valve!

22:23.907 --> 22:25.344
[clangs]

22:30.827 --> 22:32.655
WALTER:
It worked. The engine's offline,

22:32.699 --> 22:34.309
which should kill the fire
and the smoke.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.050
I'm running a full diagnostic.

22:36.093 --> 22:38.269
Hopefully the malfunction
was contained.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.271
Yeah, I have some numbers
to run as well.

22:40.315 --> 22:41.621
I just want to check
on something.

22:41.664 --> 22:43.144
I'll be with you in a moment.

22:43.187 --> 22:44.711
Looks better in there.

22:44.754 --> 22:47.366
It's easier to breathe.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.717
I want to talk to my dad.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.545
He's cold and tired.
The smoke's dissipated.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.068
We're gonna get him out soon.Okay.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.809
Hey, I-I thought Hawaii
was better for him,

22:55.852 --> 22:57.027
that I was doing right by him.

22:57.071 --> 22:58.594
My son's 13,
in college,

22:58.638 --> 23:00.596
works on incredibly
dangerous cases

23:00.640 --> 23:01.902
and wants to ask
out a 16-year-old.

23:01.945 --> 23:03.556
They're at
an age where

23:03.599 --> 23:05.035
we want to let them solve
their own problems,

23:05.079 --> 23:06.689
but those problems
have real-life consequences.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.604
It's hard.
All you can do is have

23:08.648 --> 23:11.215
open, honest communication
and hope for the best.

23:18.135 --> 23:20.486
Dad, I'm so sorry.

23:20.529 --> 23:22.139
JOE:
I-It's okay.

23:22.183 --> 23:24.185
We're gonna get you out of this.
You just need to stay calm.

23:24.228 --> 23:25.621
Be brave.

23:25.665 --> 23:28.232
Okay.
[pants]

23:28.276 --> 23:30.060
Do we have to tell Mom?

23:30.104 --> 23:33.150
[chuckles] Yeah, I think we're
gonna have to tell your mom.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.544
But it's gonna be okay.
We'll all talk it out.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.807
Open communication.

23:37.851 --> 23:40.810
There is a scenario
where I could have listened more

23:40.854 --> 23:42.029
when it came
to Patty's birthday.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.378
[sighs]

23:43.422 --> 23:45.032
It's okay.

23:45.075 --> 23:46.250
Thanks.

23:46.294 --> 23:47.817
DRAKE:
Okay.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.123
Just completed the diagnostic,

23:49.166 --> 23:50.341
and we're past the storm.

23:50.385 --> 23:52.256
Anyone nonessential needs
to buckle up.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.563
Joe, you've got
to get back to your seat.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.086
Kenny, hold tight.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.348
I'll see you in a few minutes.

23:57.392 --> 23:58.915
Okay.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.048
Can you give the phone back
to Ralph?

24:02.963 --> 24:04.355
You still with me, Kenny?

24:04.399 --> 24:05.313
Yeah.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.751
Am I gonna be okay?

24:08.795 --> 24:10.100
If your dad's like my mom,

24:10.144 --> 24:12.233
all he cares about
is keeping you safe.

24:12.276 --> 24:14.540
And he trusts us,
so you should, too.

24:14.583 --> 24:17.325
I can't believe
I did something this stupid.

24:17.368 --> 24:18.544
Don't be too hard on yourself.

24:18.587 --> 24:20.850
Adolescence is a bear.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.373
Our reasoning improves,

24:22.417 --> 24:24.288
we can grasp abstract concepts
better,

24:24.332 --> 24:26.377
and we're better at arguing.

24:26.421 --> 24:29.380
But we're also impulsive,
hungry all the time,

24:29.424 --> 24:31.731
and coping
with a lot of new hair.

24:31.774 --> 24:34.777
We're kids who can kind of think
like adults.

24:34.821 --> 24:36.475
It's a confusing time.

24:36.518 --> 24:37.998
Sounds like you have
a handle on it.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.521
[chuckles]
I wish.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.524
The kid ready to come out?

24:42.568 --> 24:43.786
Overripe.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.353
All right,
let's get this show started.

24:45.396 --> 24:46.920
Starting our descent.

24:48.443 --> 24:50.576
WALTER:
No! Stop the descent!

24:50.619 --> 24:51.577
I've run the numbers!

24:51.620 --> 24:52.969
Flying on one engine, you won't

24:53.013 --> 24:54.841
make it to L.A.
if you lower to 5,000 feet.

24:54.884 --> 24:57.278
Of course! The air
is thicker at 5,000 feet.

24:57.321 --> 24:59.280
And the plane works harder,
burns more fuel.

24:59.323 --> 25:00.760
So on one engine,
it'll take, what,

25:00.803 --> 25:02.544
twice as long to L.A.?SYLVESTER: Actually,

25:02.588 --> 25:05.547
on a twin engine plane, you
don't lose 50% of performance--

25:05.591 --> 25:07.288
you lose 75%

25:07.331 --> 25:09.290
due to the weight and drag
of the dead engine.

25:09.333 --> 25:10.204
So three times as long.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.422
TOBY:
That's a problem!

25:11.466 --> 25:12.859
Because the oxygen
and the heat we got Kenny

25:12.902 --> 25:14.600
is just a temporary fix.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.602
You got to get him out
of that wheel well soon!

25:16.645 --> 25:18.342
Then prepare to cut him out.

25:18.386 --> 25:19.735
I thought we couldn't do that

25:19.779 --> 25:21.128
without dropping to 5,000 feet

25:21.171 --> 25:22.564
or we'd cause
a decompression event

25:22.608 --> 25:23.696
that would crash the plane.WALTER: Not if we create

25:23.739 --> 25:26.133
an air lock.
If we make a sealed chamber,

25:26.176 --> 25:28.439
you can cut from it
into the wheel well.

25:28.483 --> 25:30.790
It'll cause only the air lock
to be depressurized.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.400
The rest of the plane
will be fine.

25:32.443 --> 25:33.532
Solid plan, Walt.

25:33.575 --> 25:34.707
Toby and I will head

25:34.750 --> 25:35.838
to the baggage compartment

25:35.882 --> 25:37.231
to figure out
exactly where to cut.

25:37.274 --> 25:39.450
All right, I'll grab our
saw and a scuba light.

25:39.494 --> 25:40.843
I'll look around here
for something

25:40.887 --> 25:42.105
that could be an air lock.

Ralph, there's an open seat
next to Kenny's dad.

25:45.282 --> 25:47.241
I want you to buckle up,
keep him company.

25:47.284 --> 25:49.417
But I know the physics of air
locks almost as well as Sly.

25:49.460 --> 25:50.549
I want you to buckle in.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.463
Why? Is the air lock
too old for me?

25:52.507 --> 25:54.509
Now.
You're making
an irrational decision

25:54.553 --> 25:56.293
based on your insatiable
desire to protect me.

25:56.337 --> 25:58.469
Putting me up in the cabin
instead of down here helping

25:58.513 --> 26:00.820
increases the chances
of this plane going down.

26:00.863 --> 26:02.430
So I'm irrational.
Parents are irrational

26:02.473 --> 26:04.737

Now get your butt in that seat,

26:04.780 --> 26:05.955

is not the only thing

out soon.

26:16.313 --> 26:17.401

Okay, that could work,

34:52.655 --> 34:55.136
today's events unscathed
doesn't mean you always will.

34:55.180 --> 34:56.703
You're one bad spill away

34:56.746 --> 34:58.444
from me trying to
conceive on my own,

34:58.487 --> 35:01.447
and if I remember med school
correctly, that's a tad harder.

35:01.490 --> 35:03.623
Sweetie,

35:03.666 --> 35:05.842
I know that you
feel fenced in

35:05.886 --> 35:07.583
with all the pregnancy
restrictions,

35:07.627 --> 35:09.324
I just don't want
your bucket list

35:09.368 --> 35:10.543
to end with you
kicking the bucket.

35:10.586 --> 35:13.459
I'm not racing motorcycles
and bouldering

35:13.502 --> 35:16.766
because of some pre-pregnancy
bucket list.

35:16.810 --> 35:19.073
I am doing it so
I don't have to think

35:19.117 --> 35:21.641
about the number one thing
on my actual bucket list:

35:21.684 --> 35:24.861
having a baby.

35:26.036 --> 35:28.996
Listen, I get it.
I think it's good

35:29.039 --> 35:30.563
to let off some steam.

35:30.606 --> 35:33.479
Just, how about something that
won't land you in the ER?

35:33.522 --> 35:35.785
Bull riding.

35:38.397 --> 35:41.269
There's a new place
in the arts district

35:41.313 --> 35:44.403
with mechanical bull riding
and a lovely soft cheese plate.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.448
Is that adventurous enough
for you?

35:46.492 --> 35:48.363
Deal.

35:54.935 --> 35:56.632
We're taking a car.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.069
SYLVESTER:
Fantastic.

35:59.113 --> 36:01.071
I'm excited to work with you.

36:02.464 --> 36:05.424
The military ordered my filters.

36:05.467 --> 36:06.425
Well done, kid.

36:06.468 --> 36:08.340
I know that was
a long-shot sale.

36:08.383 --> 36:09.602
The odds weren't great.

36:09.645 --> 36:11.256
Neither were the odds of us

36:11.299 --> 36:12.909
all walking away
from that landing.

36:14.694 --> 36:18.524
You've been beating a lot
of long-shot odds today.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.700
If you can do that,

36:20.743 --> 36:23.877
then surely,
a great fella like you

36:23.920 --> 36:26.227
can meet two special women
in one lifetime.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.490
You owe yourself
that chance.

36:28.534 --> 36:31.014
Hell, you owe Flo that chance.

36:31.058 --> 36:33.234
You're right.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.584
Next time I see her
I'll ask her out.

36:37.630 --> 36:40.720
And Kenny's
completely fine now?

36:40.763 --> 36:42.809
Yeah. My mom got a
call from his dad.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.114
Full recovery.

36:44.158 --> 36:45.986
That's amazing.

36:46.029 --> 36:48.380
Twice as exciting
as my birthday party.

36:48.423 --> 36:50.469
Only thing of note
was that Pat G.

36:50.512 --> 36:53.385
ate so much cake
that he barfed on Allison F.

36:53.428 --> 36:56.170
Sorry I missed it.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.390
'Cause, well...

36:58.433 --> 37:00.261
'Cause I like you, Patty.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.307
And not just as a friend.

37:02.350 --> 37:03.612
You're special to me.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.397
So...

37:05.440 --> 37:08.574
I was wondering...

37:08.617 --> 37:11.533
maybe we could go on a
date or something. Maybe.

37:13.622 --> 37:17.322
Ralph, you are the smartest,

37:17.365 --> 37:21.413
most confident and coolest
13-year-old ever,

37:21.456 --> 37:24.242
but still a 13-year-old.

37:24.285 --> 37:27.201
There's too much of
an age difference between us.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.637
And I'm be heading
off to college

37:28.681 --> 37:30.030
at the end of next year.

37:30.073 --> 37:32.467
But I'm already
in college, kinda.

37:32.511 --> 37:34.861
Another thing
that makes you so amazing.

37:34.904 --> 37:37.037
I've never been
more flattered.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.910
And the fact that someone so
special finds me special...

37:40.954 --> 37:43.348
Thank you, Ralph.

37:43.391 --> 37:45.437
I want us to always be friends.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.134
Forever. Okay?

37:49.571 --> 37:53.053
And I know that you're
gonna meet an amazing girl,

37:53.096 --> 37:55.664
who's gonna be
way cooler than me.

37:55.708 --> 37:58.145
I don't know if
that's possible.

37:58.188 --> 38:00.539
It'll happen.

38:19.732 --> 38:23.213
Hi. How'd it go?

38:26.391 --> 38:28.349
It hurts, Mom.

38:31.047 --> 38:32.527
I know.

38:32.571 --> 38:34.529
But it'll get better.

38:34.573 --> 38:36.792
You were right,
I shouldn't have told her.

38:36.836 --> 38:38.272
No, you were right.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.579
Sometimes I have to let you
do things that'll hurt.

38:40.622 --> 38:42.668
I can't always
try and protect you,

38:42.711 --> 38:44.017
even though I want to.

38:44.060 --> 38:46.280
Okay.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.586
How are your hands?

38:50.415 --> 38:53.113
Hurting, but they'll heal.

38:53.156 --> 38:56.072
How's your heart?

38:56.116 --> 38:58.031
Hurting, but it'll heal.

38:58.074 --> 39:01.121
How about we stop by Vidiots
on the way home

39:01.164 --> 39:03.210
and grab some classic "B" movies
and make a night of it?

39:03.253 --> 39:05.038
Okay.

39:05.081 --> 39:06.648
Meet you at the car.

39:15.396 --> 39:17.529
WALTER:
Hey, ready to go?

39:17.572 --> 39:19.661
I've got a night of astronomy
planned for Ralph.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.837
Rain check?
He's having girl trouble

39:21.881 --> 39:24.666
that I plan to mend with pizza
and bad horror movies.

39:24.710 --> 39:25.711
He must be in pain.

39:25.754 --> 39:28.017
Yeah, me, too.

39:28.061 --> 39:30.237
When he hurts, I hurt.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.674
I just wish I could carry
the pain for him, you know?

39:36.417 --> 39:38.637
Yeah, I understand
what that's like,

39:38.680 --> 39:40.508
not wanting to see
someone you love be hurt.

39:40.552 --> 39:41.857
It's logical to want

39:41.901 --> 39:44.294
to protect them
from unnecessary pain.

39:44.338 --> 39:46.775
Yeah, it is.

39:48.342 --> 39:50.736
Is there something that
you want to say, Walter?

39:50.779 --> 39:52.738
Uh...

39:52.781 --> 39:54.696
No, not at all. Why?

39:54.740 --> 39:56.655
When I was on the plane you said
that there was something

39:56.698 --> 39:58.657
that you wanted to say
that was weighing on you.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.746
And then everything
went haywire.

40:00.789 --> 40:03.313
Well, I was, uh, concerned

40:03.357 --> 40:05.403
that the plane
was gonna crash,

40:05.446 --> 40:06.708
so I felt guilty

40:06.752 --> 40:09.189
that I-I'd never told you

40:09.232 --> 40:10.495
that you're the love of my life.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.366
Thank you.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.628
And you're the
love of my life, too,

40:13.672 --> 40:15.587
but y-you told me
you loved me before.

40:15.630 --> 40:18.067
Yeah, I know. I just...

40:18.111 --> 40:21.593
wanted you to know... how much.

40:21.636 --> 40:23.682
Mmm.

40:24.900 --> 40:27.294
That's very sweet.

40:27.337 --> 40:29.731
Okay.

40:35.084 --> 40:37.260
[sighing]:
Oh, Walter...

40:37.304 --> 40:39.567
What are you lying about?
