00:40.105 --> 00:43.235
The area of manned spaceflight
budget request for Apollo,

00:43.242 --> 00:46.477
Is being reduced
by $42.1 million

00:46.478 --> 00:50.078
To $916.5 million.

00:50.081 --> 00:53.781
This reduction will be achieved
by canceling the Apollo 15

00:53.784 --> 00:56.152
And 19 lunar missions,

00:56.153 --> 00:59.188
Re-designating the
remaining Apollo flights

00:59.189 --> 01:02.289
As Apollo's 14 through 17.

01:12.765 --> 01:14.465
Everything
is going smoothly here

01:14.467 --> 01:17.797
At the Kennedy space center
for the launch of Apollo 17,

01:17.803 --> 01:21.373
Man's last trip to the moon
in the foreseeable future.

01:27.377 --> 01:31.377
Three, two, one ignition.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.122
We're on our way, Houston.

01:52.768 --> 01:55.868
I believe that this
nation should commit itself

01:55.872 --> 01:59.672
To achieving the goal
before this decade is out

01:59.675 --> 02:01.465
Of landing a man on the moon

02:01.476 --> 02:04.436
And returning him
safely to the earth.

02:04.445 --> 02:07.275
No single space project
in this period

02:07.281 --> 02:09.610
Will be more impressive
to mankind,

02:09.616 --> 02:13.676
Or more important for the
long-range exploration of space.

02:13.686 --> 02:17.286
None will be so difficult
or expensive to accomplish.

02:25.662 --> 02:28.398
The average taxpayer
is entitled to ask,

02:28.399 --> 02:30.369
"what's in space for me?"

02:31.834 --> 02:35.237
T minus 15 seconds,
guidance is internal.

02:35.238 --> 02:41.308
12, 11, 10, nine,
ignition sequence start,

02:41.310 --> 02:44.910
Six, five, four, three,

02:44.913 --> 02:50.283
Two, one, zero.
All engine run.

02:50.285 --> 02:54.615
Lift off, we have a lift off,
32 minutes past the hour,

02:54.622 --> 02:56.522
Lift off on Apollo 11.

02:58.290 --> 02:59.760
Roger, we got a roll program.

02:59.761 --> 03:01.189
Tower cleared.

03:01.193 --> 03:02.463
Roger, roll.

03:07.496 --> 03:09.556
What does spaceflight
do for people?

03:09.565 --> 03:11.865
It's a philosophical answer.

03:11.867 --> 03:17.467
It's exploration, it's the
human spirit of going out there.

03:17.471 --> 03:22.171
The great thing we wanna
know is, "where do we fit in?"

03:22.175 --> 03:25.235
There's two questions
that trouble us all

03:25.244 --> 03:27.344
At some point in our life.

03:27.346 --> 03:29.346
Where did we come from?

03:29.348 --> 03:30.848
And are we alone?

03:32.249 --> 03:33.679
Without the space program,

03:33.684 --> 03:37.820
Our economy would be hurled
50 years back into the past.

03:37.821 --> 03:43.521
GPS, weather satellites,
telecommunications, the internet.

03:43.526 --> 03:45.286
By the exploration of the moon,

03:45.294 --> 03:47.334
Or by landing on the moon
and walking around,

03:47.335 --> 03:50.429
That led to a space program,

03:50.432 --> 03:52.302
Which led to global
positioning systems,

03:52.303 --> 03:55.330
Which led to so-called
space assets,

03:55.336 --> 03:58.196
Which have affected everything.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.665
The reason to explore space

03:59.673 --> 04:04.243
Is that it can boost
our economy... Period.

04:04.244 --> 04:08.447
It boosts our economy
as it changes the culture.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.678
People think differently.

04:10.683 --> 04:13.721
Think about the future, think
about inventing things.

04:13.722 --> 04:15.288
Think about making
a better tomorrow,

04:15.289 --> 04:17.387
Rather than just
surviving the day.

04:17.389 --> 04:18.856
You go over the hill,

04:18.857 --> 04:20.716
You don't know what
you're gonna find.

04:20.725 --> 04:22.285
And you're not gonna
go over the hill

04:22.293 --> 04:23.963
Unless you're curious about it.

04:26.429 --> 04:30.366
It transforms the intellectual
outlook of a nation,

04:30.367 --> 04:34.667
When a nation embarks on
something bold and audacious,

04:34.671 --> 04:38.911
Such is going into deep
space, as it did in the 1960s.

04:45.777 --> 04:47.537
Today a new moon is in the sky,

04:47.546 --> 04:51.506
A 23-inch metal sphere placed
in orbit by a Russian rocket.

04:51.516 --> 04:52.746
Here, an artist's conception

04:52.750 --> 04:54.319
Of how the feat
was accomplished.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.878
A three-stage
rocket. Number one,

04:55.886 --> 04:58.846
The booster in the class of
an intercontinental missile.

04:58.855 --> 05:01.315
Its weight estimated at 50 tons.

05:01.324 --> 05:04.693
A smaller second stage took
over at 5,000 miles an hour

05:04.694 --> 05:06.932
And carried on to the
highest point reached,

05:06.933 --> 05:09.629
500 miles up,
the artificial moon is boosted

05:09.631 --> 05:11.301
To a speed counterbalancing

05:11.302 --> 05:13.929
The pull of gravity
and released.

05:15.901 --> 05:18.370
You are hearing the
actual signals transmitted

05:18.371 --> 05:20.401
By the earth circling satellite,

05:20.406 --> 05:23.606
One of the great scientific
feats of the age.

05:23.609 --> 05:27.578
In 1957 sputnik was launched.

05:27.579 --> 05:29.709
And if you ask me what
drove the creation of NASA,

05:29.714 --> 05:31.848
It was the launching of sputnik.

05:31.849 --> 05:33.579
The public often
thinks of sputnik as,

05:33.584 --> 05:36.622
"oh, it's just an innocent little
satellite that went beep."

05:36.623 --> 05:38.750
Let's part the curtains,
and you find out

05:38.755 --> 05:41.515
This was the shell

05:41.524 --> 05:44.324
Of an intercontinental
ballistic missile

05:44.326 --> 05:46.456
That had been hollowed out

05:46.461 --> 05:48.961
And a radio transmitter
put in the head.

05:48.963 --> 05:52.966
That's what was flying
over our heads in America

05:52.967 --> 05:54.767
On October 4th, 1957.

05:56.034 --> 05:58.870
Spooked us to no end.

05:58.871 --> 06:01.871
No one said, "oh, the frontier
of exploration is breached."

06:01.874 --> 06:05.484
No, it was, "the soviet union
has the new high ground."

06:05.485 --> 06:07.707
"They are our sworn enemy.

06:07.712 --> 06:09.952
"We can't look bad
in front of them.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.877
"We've gotta do it too.

06:11.882 --> 06:13.982
We need an agency
to take care of this."

06:13.984 --> 06:16.554
A year later, NASA was founded.

06:17.986 --> 06:20.546
This special report
brought to you by NASA,

06:20.556 --> 06:23.616
The national aeronautics
and space administration.

06:23.625 --> 06:25.385
What we had was something

06:25.393 --> 06:28.793
That had come out
of a very can-do spirit,

06:28.796 --> 06:32.396
That came out of the spirit
of winning world war ii.

06:32.399 --> 06:35.499
It came out
of the technology burst

06:35.502 --> 06:37.972
That was going on around
the world at that time.

06:37.973 --> 06:40.771
It came out
of the imaginations of people

06:40.773 --> 06:44.609
Like Wernher Von Braun,
Willy Ley, and Walt Disney.

06:44.610 --> 06:47.878
In our modern world,
everywhere we look,

06:47.879 --> 06:51.948
We see the influence science
has upon our daily lives.

06:51.949 --> 06:53.919
Now here's a model, my design

06:53.920 --> 06:56.647
For a four-stage
orbital rocket ship.

06:56.653 --> 06:58.353
It came out of the inspiration

06:58.354 --> 07:02.090
Of people like Arthur C. Clarke,
and Robert Heinlein,

07:02.091 --> 07:04.421
And Isaac Asimov,
and Silverberg,

07:04.426 --> 07:06.456
And all the great science
fiction writers of the time,

07:06.461 --> 07:09.061
Who were inspiring children

07:09.063 --> 07:12.031
And all kinds of people
in that realm.

07:12.032 --> 07:16.432
And then we had the spark
that ignited that passion

07:16.436 --> 07:19.136
Into a fire that
was from sputnik.

07:19.138 --> 07:20.868
People said, "what happens"

07:20.873 --> 07:23.443
"if there's a hydrogen
bomb orbiting head?

07:23.444 --> 07:25.142
"If the Russians have
the high ground,

07:25.143 --> 07:29.113
Then we could be
outmaneuvered in the next war."

07:30.045 --> 07:31.475
The United States too,

07:31.480 --> 07:33.480
Promised to launch
an earth satellite,

07:33.482 --> 07:35.649
But in our satellite program,

07:35.650 --> 07:37.880
We Americans got
badly bogged down.

07:37.885 --> 07:39.675
Why? What happened?

07:39.686 --> 07:41.546
We had the money, the resources,

07:41.554 --> 07:43.454
And the scientific know-how.

07:43.455 --> 07:46.455
Unfortunately, a series
of wrong decisions

07:46.458 --> 07:48.888
Led us to frustration
and failure.

07:48.893 --> 07:52.528
This order went out
to the armed services.

07:52.529 --> 07:54.929
Let me read it to you.

07:54.931 --> 07:58.101
"Recent news stories which have
described certain projects

07:58.102 --> 08:00.768
"as space flight projects

08:00.769 --> 08:03.069
"have resulted
in unfavorable reaction

08:03.071 --> 08:06.907
"at department of defense
and congressional levels.

08:06.908 --> 08:09.808
"In any speeches
or public releases

08:09.810 --> 08:11.910
"planned by you or your staff,

08:11.912 --> 08:16.448
"avoid the mention
or the discussion of space,

08:16.449 --> 08:19.979
Space technology,
and space vehicles."

08:21.552 --> 08:24.087
And so, by the summer of 1957,

08:24.088 --> 08:28.018
"space" had become
a forbidden word in Washington.

08:28.025 --> 08:30.525
In totally realistic terms,

08:30.527 --> 08:33.895
Von Braun could've
had us there in 1950.

08:33.897 --> 08:36.027
We need to understand,

08:36.032 --> 08:40.068
We would have launched
a satellite in 1950.

08:40.068 --> 08:43.799
The reason we did not is
because we didn't wish to.

08:43.806 --> 08:47.066
Panic set in, and after
that people said, "okay",

08:47.075 --> 08:49.975
Let's regroup,
let's do something."

08:49.977 --> 08:53.807
It was your patriotic duty
to become a physicist,

08:53.814 --> 08:55.814
A chemist, a mathematician.

08:55.816 --> 08:58.676
It was for America
and for freedom

08:58.685 --> 09:02.015
That people said, "yes, I wanna
to become a cold war hero"

09:02.021 --> 09:04.689
For their freedom
and for liberty."

09:04.690 --> 09:08.590
The history of human reaction...

09:08.593 --> 09:12.763
To the threat of death
knows no bounds...

09:13.895 --> 09:15.925
And knowing no bounds includes

09:15.931 --> 09:19.131
Birthing an entire space program

09:19.134 --> 09:21.174
For the purpose
of showing the world

09:21.175 --> 09:25.469
That we will not be bested
by evil godless communists.

09:25.473 --> 09:29.008
Such was the mood
and the attitude in the 1950s.

09:29.009 --> 09:31.609
Man had his first
great success in space

09:31.611 --> 09:34.111
When the Russians pushed
a man across the threshold.

09:34.113 --> 09:35.746
He was Yuri Gagarin,

09:35.747 --> 09:37.707
The astronaut
the Russians lionized

09:37.715 --> 09:39.545
As the first to orbit the earth.

09:39.550 --> 09:42.650
It was the propaganda coup
of the year.

09:44.588 --> 09:45.648
Thank you.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.625
"But why," some say, "the moon?

09:53.628 --> 09:56.628
Why choose this as our goal?"

09:56.631 --> 10:01.001
And they may well ask,
"why climb the highest mountain?

10:01.002 --> 10:04.738
"Why, 35 years ago,
fly the Atlantic?

10:04.739 --> 10:07.069
Why does rice play Texas?"

10:07.074 --> 10:09.909
We choose to go to the moon.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.510
We choose to go to the moon.

10:17.850 --> 10:20.750
We choose to go
to the moon in this decade

10:20.753 --> 10:24.193
And do the other things,
not because they are easy,

10:24.194 --> 10:26.256
But because they are hard,

10:26.257 --> 10:30.787
Because that goal will serve
to organize and measure

10:30.794 --> 10:33.729
The best of our
energies and skills,

10:33.730 --> 10:35.830
Because that challenge is one

10:35.832 --> 10:37.899
That we're willing to accept,

10:37.900 --> 10:40.830
One we are unwilling
to postpone,

10:40.836 --> 10:42.696
And one we intend to win.

10:42.704 --> 10:46.406
At the time that president
Kennedy made his speech,

10:46.407 --> 10:49.207
We had never been to orbit.

10:49.209 --> 10:53.878
Just a little bit over a week
before the Kennedy speech

10:53.879 --> 10:55.379
To the us congress,

10:55.380 --> 10:57.180
We had launched Alan Shepard.

10:57.181 --> 11:01.217
Ahh, roger, liftoff
and the clock is started.

11:01.218 --> 11:05.718
And we were challenged to beat
the Russians to the moon.

11:05.722 --> 11:07.992
So, to a great extent
that initial challenge

11:07.993 --> 11:10.890
Was one that I believe
was geopolitical,

11:10.892 --> 11:13.392
But it also had
the economic benefit

11:13.394 --> 11:16.194
To basically generate
the enthusiasm

11:16.196 --> 11:19.396
And the passion
within the American public.

11:37.014 --> 11:40.851
The spur to education...
very, very important.

11:40.852 --> 11:43.352
I think that's
almost as significant

11:43.354 --> 11:46.456
As our actual flights
themselves,

11:46.457 --> 11:48.987
Because it gave
all the young people

11:48.992 --> 11:51.992
Something to look forward to,
and excitement,

11:51.995 --> 11:54.695
Something that
they could live up to.

11:54.697 --> 11:57.857
Every day, I meet people
now in their 50s,

11:57.866 --> 12:01.226
Who said, "look, when I was
a little kid, you know",

12:01.236 --> 12:03.436
You inspired me
to become an engineer,"

12:03.438 --> 12:06.238
Or become a scientist,
to becoming a doctor,

12:06.240 --> 12:09.240
And that gives me a sort
of a sense of satisfaction

12:09.243 --> 12:12.878
That I was in a program
that helped other people

12:12.879 --> 12:15.079
Form good careers.

12:36.799 --> 12:41.399
I think one of the greatest
moments of the last century

12:41.404 --> 12:44.274
In the space program was
the flight of Apollo 8.

12:44.275 --> 12:45.443
I was on that flight.

12:47.340 --> 12:49.440
At the time that we did it,

12:49.443 --> 12:53.279
I don't think we fully
understood the significance

12:53.280 --> 12:56.110
Of the very first
flight to the moon,

12:56.116 --> 12:58.916
The whole 240,000 miles.

12:58.918 --> 13:01.388
We were the pathfinders,
we didn't land,

13:01.389 --> 13:04.987
But we checked the navigation,
checked the communication,

13:04.990 --> 13:07.890
Circled the moon
and looked at the far side,

13:07.892 --> 13:10.992
The side that we never
see from the earth.

13:30.379 --> 13:34.416
We brought back
with us a photograph

13:34.417 --> 13:36.517
Of the earth from the moon...

13:37.919 --> 13:40.488
We called "earth-rise,"

13:40.489 --> 13:43.919
Which I think
in just one picture

13:43.925 --> 13:49.255
Told us how insignificant
we all are here on earth.

13:50.996 --> 13:54.826
The earth is merely
a small planet...

13:54.834 --> 13:57.334
That just so happened to
be at the right distance

13:57.336 --> 14:00.236
And the right mass
to sustain life...

14:01.504 --> 14:03.474
Going around
a rather normal star,

14:03.475 --> 14:08.073
And that star is in the
outer edge of a galaxy

14:08.076 --> 14:09.976
Called the milky way,

14:09.977 --> 14:15.307
Just one of millions
of galaxies in our universe.

14:16.415 --> 14:20.015
And maybe, just for a
small amount of time

14:20.019 --> 14:25.319
In December of 1968, everyone
kind of felt a closeness

14:25.324 --> 14:27.994
That we had not felt before.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.059
For the first time
in history today,

14:31.061 --> 14:35.061
Man got a long distance live
view of the planet he lives on,

14:35.065 --> 14:37.995
Transmitted and described
by the first three human beings

14:38.001 --> 14:39.601
To travel to the moon.

14:39.602 --> 14:40.971
The Apollo 8 astronauts

14:40.972 --> 14:43.039
Sent back those pictures
this afternoon,

14:43.040 --> 14:46.968
And we'll have more along with the
full story later in this broadcast.

14:46.975 --> 14:48.505
I think what happened

14:48.509 --> 14:52.609
Was Kennedy wanting
to demonstrate to the soviets

14:52.613 --> 14:55.251
That we were the biggest,
baddest kids on the block,

14:55.252 --> 14:56.848
That our technology will kick

14:56.849 --> 14:59.279
Your technology's ass any time.

14:59.284 --> 15:02.252
And it worked,
and it was glorious,

15:02.253 --> 15:06.122
But it wasn't sustainable
because it was a crisis project.

15:06.123 --> 15:08.591
If it was actually
about exploration

15:08.592 --> 15:12.161
And about the scientific
frontier being pushed outward,

15:12.162 --> 15:14.296
If it were actually about that,

15:14.297 --> 15:16.197
Maybe we would have
had a scientist

15:16.198 --> 15:18.128
On the first mission
to the moon.

15:18.133 --> 15:20.603
But no, there was
no scientist on Apollo 11,

15:20.604 --> 15:23.102
Nor on Apollo 12, or Apollo 13,

15:23.104 --> 15:27.307
Or Apollo 14, or Apollo
15, or Apollo 16.

15:27.308 --> 15:31.408
The first scientist
was on Apollo 17,

15:31.412 --> 15:35.381
And Apollo 17 was
the last mission to the moon.

15:35.382 --> 15:38.317
There was not a statement made

15:38.318 --> 15:40.218
That we're gonna go to the moon

15:40.219 --> 15:42.486
And establish a human community.

15:42.487 --> 15:44.387
We're not gonna go to, you know,

15:44.388 --> 15:46.288
The moon and then on to mars.

15:46.289 --> 15:49.059
We're not gonna go
do this and then that.

15:49.060 --> 15:53.058
It was simply, "we're going to
put a human being on the moon."

15:53.062 --> 15:54.902
And we achieved it.

15:56.130 --> 15:58.060
Do you wish

15:58.066 --> 16:00.666
That the first Apollo mission
hadn't reached the moon?

16:00.668 --> 16:02.028
Or that we hadn't
gone on to mars

16:02.036 --> 16:04.096
And then to the nearest star?

16:04.104 --> 16:05.904
That's like saying you wish

16:05.905 --> 16:08.435
That you still operated
with scalpels,

16:08.440 --> 16:10.970
And sewed your patients
up with catgut,

16:10.975 --> 16:15.135
Like your great-great-great-
great-grandfather used to.

16:15.145 --> 16:18.675
Ever since the time of sputnik
and president Kennedy,

16:18.681 --> 16:21.351
I think our dedication
to the space program

16:21.352 --> 16:23.920
Has been high,
higher than most countries.

16:23.921 --> 16:26.149
And I feel like,
probably over the past decade,

16:26.154 --> 16:28.088
It's waned significantly.

16:28.089 --> 16:30.419
I feel like we should
be doing more in space

16:30.424 --> 16:32.224
'cause I think there's
a lot of learning to be done

16:32.225 --> 16:34.015
As far as vaccines
and a lot of things

16:34.026 --> 16:35.556
That can help
the American people,

16:35.560 --> 16:37.127
Even though it's
not a sexy program

16:37.128 --> 16:38.628
Like it used to be
with the moon landing.

16:38.629 --> 16:41.399
I think it's more important now
than it has been in decades.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.698
I know that it's not
really doing much anymore

16:44.701 --> 16:47.939
Since the space shuttle
program was closed down,

16:47.940 --> 16:50.097
So I don't know
what they're up to.

16:50.105 --> 16:52.165
Be cool if they were
doing something soon.

16:52.173 --> 16:54.411
You know, when I see them
building robots, you know,

16:54.412 --> 16:57.308
To go on mars, or I see
what the rover, curiosity,

16:57.310 --> 17:02.010
Opportunity, and spirits
are doing, we basically just...

17:02.014 --> 17:03.984
It excites me to know
that we're doing that.

17:05.281 --> 17:08.382
To me, a culture that's not
doing that is stagnant,

17:08.386 --> 17:11.016
And a culture that is
doing that is progressive

17:11.021 --> 17:13.491
And moving forward
in a positive direction.

17:13.492 --> 17:15.358
Back in the '60s when
we first, you know,

17:15.359 --> 17:17.558
When the space program
was in full swing,

17:17.560 --> 17:19.429
I fully expected us
to have colonies

17:19.430 --> 17:21.028
On the moon by this time.

17:21.029 --> 17:22.159
Where are they?

17:23.997 --> 17:26.127
I'm disappointed
to see that we're...

17:26.133 --> 17:29.103
That we're not putting more
effort into something like that.

17:29.104 --> 17:31.702
I think it's just
absolutely essential

17:31.704 --> 17:35.544
That we maintain this
program and advance it.

17:36.607 --> 17:38.976
All those who think
it's a problem

17:38.977 --> 17:41.037
That we haven't been
outside of low earth orbit

17:41.045 --> 17:43.745
For four decades can only say so

17:43.747 --> 17:46.577
Because they think
that going to the moon

17:46.583 --> 17:49.283
Was the first step of
this great adventure

17:49.285 --> 17:51.045
Where we explore space,

17:51.053 --> 17:52.423
And somehow we've failed

17:52.424 --> 17:55.689
On the expectations
we had for ourselves.

17:55.690 --> 17:58.320
But once you realize we went
because we were at war...

18:00.059 --> 18:01.527
And then they're not
going to the moon,

18:01.528 --> 18:03.608
They're not going to mars,
and the cold war's over...

18:05.129 --> 18:06.659
What's your motivation?

18:08.231 --> 18:10.766
The moon, a lonely world

18:10.767 --> 18:12.667
In the absence of man.

18:14.168 --> 18:16.998
But here we have left our mark,

18:17.005 --> 18:20.765
A signature attesting a
legacy to future generations.

18:22.441 --> 18:27.011
We stood on the shoulders of
giants and touched the moon.

18:29.546 --> 18:32.676
The decision what
to do after Apollo

18:32.683 --> 18:36.323
Was driven by desire
to limit NASA spending...

18:37.419 --> 18:40.549
To only a fraction
of what it had been

18:40.556 --> 18:43.086
At the height of
the Apollo program.

18:43.091 --> 18:46.726
And in order to reach
that lower budget,

18:46.727 --> 18:50.227
You couldn't continue
to use Saturn V's.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.400
They were too
expensive per launch,

18:52.401 --> 18:54.466
So the program devolved back

18:54.467 --> 18:57.367
Into a low earth orbit program.

18:57.369 --> 18:59.138
Senator Edward
Kennedy urged today

18:59.139 --> 19:01.667
That spending on the space
program be cut back

19:01.672 --> 19:04.342
After the goals set
for exploring the moon

19:04.343 --> 19:05.610
Have been achieved.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.608
Senator Kennedy said
a substantial portion

19:07.610 --> 19:09.910
Of the space budget
should be diverted

19:09.912 --> 19:12.752
To what he called "pressing
problems here at home."

19:12.753 --> 19:16.248
Going into outer space
is very expensive.

19:16.251 --> 19:20.320
It costs $10,000 to put
a pound of anything

19:20.321 --> 19:22.388
Just into near-earth orbit.

19:22.389 --> 19:24.519
That your weight in gold.

19:24.524 --> 19:29.426
Now, to put you on the moon
cost about $100,000 a pound,

19:29.427 --> 19:31.487
And to put you on mars

19:31.495 --> 19:34.825
Would cost over a
million dollars a pound.

19:34.831 --> 19:38.300
That is your weight in diamonds.

19:38.301 --> 19:41.639
Back in a 1960s, the great
superpowers didn't care,

19:41.640 --> 19:44.397
Spending so much money
on the space race,

19:44.406 --> 19:46.736
Because it was a matter
of national pride

19:46.741 --> 19:48.341
And national security.

19:48.342 --> 19:50.280
But now that the
cold war is over,

19:50.281 --> 19:52.607
The great powers are
not willing to spend

19:52.612 --> 19:54.950
So much of their
national treasure,

19:54.951 --> 19:57.877
Because national pride
and national security

19:57.883 --> 20:00.383
Are no longer at stake.

20:00.385 --> 20:04.415
Imagine if you and I
climbed in a plane right now

20:04.422 --> 20:07.757
And wanted to fly to
new york city and back.

20:07.758 --> 20:10.558
And along the way,

20:10.560 --> 20:14.229
All of its pieces are
gonna be thrown away,

20:14.230 --> 20:16.260
So that when you
arrive in new york,

20:16.265 --> 20:18.865
If you make it at all,

20:18.867 --> 20:22.336
You'll arrive in a
little capsule and land.

20:22.337 --> 20:25.297
Now, the only way
you get to come back

20:25.306 --> 20:28.506
Is for them to rebuild
the entire rocket

20:28.509 --> 20:31.409
Upon which that
original capsule stood,

20:31.411 --> 20:32.941
Climb in it and fly
back, and by the way,

20:32.945 --> 20:35.705
You're gonna throw all
the pieces away again.

20:35.714 --> 20:37.854
What that pretty
well assures you

20:37.855 --> 20:41.849
Is that very, very few people
are gonna make that trip.

20:46.656 --> 20:48.286
Stage two, clear.

20:48.291 --> 20:49.791
If all goes according
to schedule,

20:49.792 --> 20:52.562
Scenes like this,
a reusable space shuttle

20:52.563 --> 20:54.830
Making its final
approach to land,

20:54.831 --> 20:57.499
Will be a common sight
beginning next fall.

20:57.500 --> 21:01.367
The space shuttle was
promised to us in the '70s

21:01.368 --> 21:07.306
As a vehicle that would
fly over 50 times a year.

21:07.307 --> 21:09.337
The shuttle was
gonna bring the cost

21:09.342 --> 21:12.977
Of going into orbit
down to $100 a pound.

21:12.978 --> 21:14.678
It looks like a jet plane,

21:14.679 --> 21:16.349
Will lift off like a rocket,

21:16.350 --> 21:18.607
And will return like a glider,

21:18.615 --> 21:22.445
Commuting to space every
two weeks is the plan.

21:22.452 --> 21:24.492
If you measure
it by that metric,

21:24.493 --> 21:27.717
The program was a complete
and utter failure.

21:35.695 --> 21:39.425
The basic drivers were low
cost, reliable, reusable.

21:39.433 --> 21:41.467
Let's call it a space bus.

21:41.468 --> 21:44.868
That was the motivation
in 1969... a bus,

21:44.871 --> 21:47.001
Up and down under
all conditions.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.966
And the shuttle program
did not turn out

21:48.974 --> 21:50.474
The way it was supposed to.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.965
It was supposed to be
$10 million a flight,

21:51.976 --> 21:54.876
And ended up $1.2
billion a flight,

21:54.878 --> 21:58.046
So you know it missed
by 1200 times over.

21:58.047 --> 22:01.747
The shuttle is kind of
all things to all people.

22:01.750 --> 22:04.718
Originally, from
NASA's point of view,

22:04.719 --> 22:06.489
It was going to be
a supply vehicle

22:06.490 --> 22:08.847
To go to a large space station.

22:08.856 --> 22:13.786
And NASA in 1969 proposed
building the space station

22:13.793 --> 22:16.661
And having it supplied
by the shuttle.

22:16.662 --> 22:20.962
The Nixon administration decided
not to approve a station,

22:20.966 --> 22:25.596
And so the rationale for a shuttle
had to become reinvented,

22:25.603 --> 22:28.441
And it became a launch
vehicle for everything.

22:28.442 --> 22:30.469
That's the theory
of Dr. John Logsdon,

22:30.474 --> 22:33.512
A George Washington university
political science professor,

22:33.513 --> 22:35.910
Who has written extensively
on the space program

22:35.912 --> 22:37.579
For the last dozen years.

22:37.580 --> 22:40.380
NASA so get used to the
luxury of the extra money,

22:40.382 --> 22:42.382
The public attention,

22:42.384 --> 22:45.084
The importance to
the general public

22:45.086 --> 22:46.546
That came with Apollo,

22:46.554 --> 22:48.054
And the excitement
and the challenge,

22:48.055 --> 22:49.585
And wanted to do it again.

22:49.589 --> 22:51.459
What do we need a
space shuttle for?

22:51.460 --> 22:52.957
Or a space station?

22:52.958 --> 22:55.788
Well, some people said that
we need a space station

22:55.794 --> 22:58.762
To be the terminus
for the space shuttle.

22:58.763 --> 23:01.063
Well, then why do we
need a space shuttle?

23:01.065 --> 23:03.925
To be the way to reach
the space station.

23:03.934 --> 23:06.804
Now, I think that's a
bit circular, isn't it?

23:06.805 --> 23:08.436
You know, at first, you look

23:08.437 --> 23:09.797
At the space program,
"oh, that's so cool.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.395
The space shuttle,
that's amazing."

23:11.406 --> 23:12.806
Then you know, "this is great,"

23:12.807 --> 23:15.807
And then you really look
at it and you realize,

23:15.810 --> 23:19.040
"hold it, they're
not going anywhere.

23:19.046 --> 23:20.876
They're not doing anything."

23:20.881 --> 23:22.550
john Logsdon says the shuttle

23:22.551 --> 23:24.479
Could turn out to be
a classic mistake.

23:24.484 --> 23:25.984
It's a pretty good space truck

23:25.985 --> 23:27.415
For taking things up and down,

23:27.419 --> 23:29.989
But for doing anything
once you're in orbit,

23:29.990 --> 23:33.088
It's a very inflexible
and underpowered vehicle.

23:33.091 --> 23:34.921
The shuttle is the most
complex space vehicle

23:34.926 --> 23:36.486
Man has ever built.

23:36.494 --> 23:38.964
It is a result of nine
years of compromise,

23:38.965 --> 23:41.563
Negotiation, and cost overruns.

23:41.565 --> 23:44.565
Soon, we'll begin to find
out if it was all worth it.

23:44.568 --> 23:47.468
John Danzing, NBC news,
at Kennedy space center.

23:47.470 --> 23:49.770
So, the shuttle was
designed to be reusable,

23:49.772 --> 23:52.507
And therefore much
less expensive,

23:52.508 --> 23:56.508
And in the end there was no
way to maintain the flight rate

23:56.512 --> 23:58.479
That was projected for it.

23:58.480 --> 24:02.110
It just didn't work out that
way because it was too complex,

24:02.116 --> 24:04.676
Too expensive, and then
we had the accidents.

24:13.458 --> 24:14.758
It is the worst
disaster in the history

24:14.760 --> 24:16.390
Of the American space program,

24:16.394 --> 24:18.534
And president Reagan has
declared a week of mourning

24:18.535 --> 24:22.429
For the seven astronauts,
five men and two women

24:22.432 --> 24:25.532
Who lost their lives on their
way into space this morning.

24:25.535 --> 24:29.495
Yeah, the challenger
really changed everything.

24:29.505 --> 24:32.635
It was one of the... it was
a priority in the nation

24:32.641 --> 24:35.041
To get every payload
onto the shuttle,

24:35.043 --> 24:36.710
To get it's usage up,

24:36.711 --> 24:39.511
To make sure it's utilization
was as high as it could be.

24:39.513 --> 24:41.413
There was a lot of
attention focused on it.

24:41.414 --> 24:43.584
It was a terrible
tragedy replayed over

24:43.585 --> 24:45.782
And over again on television.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.453
And, there had sort
of been a feeling

24:47.454 --> 24:48.752
In the space community

24:48.753 --> 24:51.593
That if there was a tragic
accident with a shuttle,

24:51.594 --> 24:53.489
It would never fly again.

24:53.490 --> 24:55.520
There was 32 months,
I think it was,

24:55.525 --> 24:57.155
Before another
space shuttle flew,

24:57.159 --> 24:59.829
But there were changes,
considerable changes

24:59.830 --> 25:03.098
To the nature of the space
shuttle program after that.

25:03.099 --> 25:05.827
For example, originally the
shuttle was gonna be launching

25:05.833 --> 25:07.202
Just about every satellite

25:07.203 --> 25:09.201
That the United States
wanted to put up.

25:09.203 --> 25:12.772
Instead they said that, "no,
you are only gonna use this"

25:12.773 --> 25:15.508
"for things you really need
to have people involved in.

25:15.509 --> 25:16.879
"If you can just
launch it on a rocket,

25:16.880 --> 25:18.177
"launch it on a rocket.

25:18.178 --> 25:19.978
You don't need to launch
it on the space shuttle."

25:19.979 --> 25:21.946
to take these highly skilled

25:21.947 --> 25:24.607
Amazing people
called astronauts,

25:24.616 --> 25:27.846
And put them in charge
of driving this truck

25:27.852 --> 25:30.820
Around in circles in orbit

25:30.821 --> 25:34.721
Instead of doing something
really exciting and important...

25:34.724 --> 25:36.894
You know, that's where
the problems came from,

25:36.895 --> 25:39.692
And that came from
a lack of leadership

25:39.694 --> 25:41.728
Down the street from NASA,

25:41.729 --> 25:43.859
You know, in congress
and in the white house.

25:48.235 --> 25:53.565
It was so difficult... new
scientists, new technology,

25:53.573 --> 25:55.911
So difficult to operate.
It made us good.

25:55.912 --> 25:58.168
We had to be good to
operate that system,

25:58.176 --> 25:59.906
But at the end of
the shuttle program,

25:59.911 --> 26:02.711
We are a massively good
space-faring nation.

26:02.713 --> 26:06.213
We, the us now, we're fantastic
now, we are good now.

26:06.216 --> 26:09.146
We are excellent in the
space-faring business.

26:10.752 --> 26:14.188
The difficulty of the
shuttle made us good,

26:14.189 --> 26:16.719
But after that,
the space station,

26:16.724 --> 26:19.624
Was a massive strategic error.

26:30.901 --> 26:33.071
Skylab was the first
test of our ability

26:33.072 --> 26:34.700
To endure weightlessness,

26:34.704 --> 26:37.074
And astronauts found that
they could effectively work,

26:37.075 --> 26:41.743
Exercise, eat, and sleep
in their temporary home.

26:41.744 --> 26:43.714
More recently, the space
shuttle has allowed us

26:43.715 --> 26:47.512
To fly into orbit, conduct
our business, and return.

26:47.515 --> 26:49.045
In addition to
providing a laboratory

26:49.049 --> 26:51.749
For carrying out
experiments in microgravity,

26:51.751 --> 26:53.251
The shuttle has
also benefited us

26:53.252 --> 26:55.152
Commercially and scientifically

26:55.153 --> 26:58.223
Through the deployment
and capture of satellites.

27:00.289 --> 27:03.219
But, the shuttle was designed
with a larger goal in mind,

27:03.226 --> 27:05.226
To transport astronauts
and materials

27:05.228 --> 27:09.658
To a proposed base, a
permanent manned space station.

27:11.666 --> 27:16.766
Space station was NASA's
primary objective after Apollo.

27:16.771 --> 27:19.001
What NASA hoped to get approved

27:19.006 --> 27:22.606
Was a 12-person space
station launched by Saturn V,

27:22.609 --> 27:27.939
And supplied by the shuttle
in the '69-'70 period.

27:27.946 --> 27:31.716
The white house did not
approve that program,

27:31.717 --> 27:34.647
And instead we went ahead
with the space shuttle,

27:34.653 --> 27:36.053
But the shuttle was designed

27:36.054 --> 27:38.722
To launch modules of
the space station.

27:38.723 --> 27:41.958
It was clear in 1971 or '72

27:41.959 --> 27:44.228
That, once the shuttle
started flying,

27:44.229 --> 27:46.287
NASA would go back
and ask approval

27:46.295 --> 27:48.695
- To develop the space station.
- we have lift off.

27:48.697 --> 27:51.857
And indeed they did
that in 1983,

27:51.866 --> 27:53.826
And finally president Reagan

27:53.834 --> 27:55.804
Announced approval
of the space station

27:55.805 --> 27:59.437
In the state of the union
address in January of '84.

27:59.438 --> 28:01.838
Tonight I am directing NASA

28:01.840 --> 28:03.770
To develop a permanently
manned space station

28:03.775 --> 28:06.805
And to do it within a decade.

28:06.811 --> 28:08.780
Despite problems
with recent missions,

28:08.781 --> 28:10.148
NASA is still pushing hard

28:10.149 --> 28:12.677
For a permanent space
station someday.

28:12.682 --> 28:14.182
Many scientists and politicians

28:14.183 --> 28:15.683
Say it is not clear what purpose

28:15.684 --> 28:17.784
The space station
is supposed to serve.

28:17.786 --> 28:19.116
We're doing it backwards.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.820
We're saying, "we're
gonna have a station."

28:20.821 --> 28:22.891
And by the way, what can you
do if you have a station?"

28:22.892 --> 28:25.019
yes, it cost $100 billion.

28:25.024 --> 28:27.762
Yes, it's a cooperative
effort of many nations,

28:27.763 --> 28:30.730
But a lot of the space
station I think was wasteful,

28:30.731 --> 28:33.459
Because the science done
on the space station

28:33.465 --> 28:35.125
Was actually minimal.

28:35.133 --> 28:38.902
Skylab, '72 was a
massively successful station.

28:38.903 --> 28:40.941
It already had 200
experiments built in.

28:40.942 --> 28:42.798
All those things matured us,

28:42.806 --> 28:47.706
In terms of on-orbit space ops
and long-term space flight.

28:47.710 --> 28:49.410
We already did that.

28:49.411 --> 28:52.079
See, I'm not criticizing
space station.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.280
What I'm saying is,
what does space station

28:54.282 --> 28:56.416
Do for the man on the street?

28:56.417 --> 28:58.147
They don't know.

28:59.118 --> 29:01.086
Go out and ask them.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.887
I honestly don't know,

29:02.888 --> 29:05.858
And they make no effort
to tell normal people,

29:05.859 --> 29:07.917
So I mean I don't actually...

29:07.925 --> 29:09.755
I don't know what's
going on at all.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.260
Yeah, I really don't
know what they're doing.

29:11.261 --> 29:12.891
They don't really say anything.

29:12.895 --> 29:14.955
All you hear is they bring
supplies back and forth,

29:14.963 --> 29:18.263
So I mean what is
the object of it?

29:18.266 --> 29:21.296
I have no idea what they'd
be doing up there, honestly.

29:21.302 --> 29:23.472
I don't pay that much attention
to this kind of stuff.

29:23.473 --> 29:25.137
Okay.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.138
- Unfortunately, we don't know.
- -not now. Not now.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.840
- Not now, nope.
- Yeah.

29:28.841 --> 29:32.176
If you have a program
which costs $150 billion,

29:32.177 --> 29:33.907
And you ask the
person on the street

29:33.912 --> 29:36.952
What are you getting for
this and they don't know,

29:36.953 --> 29:39.278
You've missed the vision, sir.

29:39.283 --> 29:41.523
We actually didn't finish
building the space station

29:41.524 --> 29:45.318
Until 2010. It was supposed
to be done in 1994.

29:45.321 --> 29:47.791
Well, it did in fact
basically suck the life

29:47.792 --> 29:50.190
Out of the human spaceflight
program for 25 years,

29:50.192 --> 29:52.992
And so it was very
hard to get approval

29:52.994 --> 29:57.530
For new things going forward,
not that people didn't try.

29:57.531 --> 29:59.498
We must commit ourselves anew

29:59.499 --> 30:02.999
To a sustained program
of manned exploration

30:03.002 --> 30:05.336
Of the solar system, and yes,

30:05.337 --> 30:08.906
The permanent
settlement of space.

30:08.907 --> 30:12.407
As George HW Bush came
into the white house,

30:12.410 --> 30:15.040
He indicated he
wanted to do something

30:15.045 --> 30:17.445
To revitalize the space program.

30:17.447 --> 30:22.017
And his advisers prepared
for him an announcement

30:22.018 --> 30:25.518
Called the space
exploration initiative.

30:25.521 --> 30:28.121
Back to the moon, on to
mars, this time to stay.

30:28.123 --> 30:29.892
Great stuff, but NASA came back

30:29.893 --> 30:32.160
With a program to
do it in 30 years

30:32.161 --> 30:34.559
That involved building
floating spaceports

30:34.561 --> 30:37.796
And giant interplanetary
spaceships,

30:37.797 --> 30:40.797
And all kinds of things that
were never gonna happen.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.300
And of course, the
architecture meant

30:42.301 --> 30:43.868
You have to have a launch system

30:43.869 --> 30:45.399
And you have to have
all the other pieces

30:45.403 --> 30:48.443
Of what it would take
to do an entire mission

30:48.444 --> 30:52.169
To the surface of the
moon and go on to mars.

30:52.176 --> 30:54.836
Well, you total up all
those assets necessary

30:54.845 --> 30:59.075
Over a 20-year period, and
the total was $500 billion.

31:00.481 --> 31:04.051
Well, that figure got
leaked to the hill,

31:04.052 --> 31:05.892
And the way the hill
looks at money is

31:05.893 --> 31:10.257
$500 billion dollars with a
B is in like today's money.

31:10.258 --> 31:12.018
And so, it was dead on arrival.

31:12.026 --> 31:14.526
They never even
bothered to look at it.

31:14.528 --> 31:16.328
Let me introduce to you

31:16.329 --> 31:18.359
Our speaker for this afternoon,

31:18.364 --> 31:22.867
Robert Zubrin from
martin Marietta... Astro.

31:22.868 --> 31:25.836
He's a senior engineer there

31:25.837 --> 31:30.267
On the moon and mars
initiative missions work

31:30.274 --> 31:32.244
That martin Marietta is doing.

31:32.245 --> 31:34.042
Robert, come talk to us.

31:34.043 --> 31:39.613
Mars direct is a plan
for sending humans to mars

31:39.615 --> 31:41.575
With present day technology.

31:41.583 --> 31:43.383
It's a plan that
could be implemented

31:43.384 --> 31:45.584
Within eight years
of program start.

31:45.586 --> 31:47.286
This was developed by myself

31:47.287 --> 31:49.487
And another engineer
named David baker

31:49.489 --> 31:51.089
While we were working

31:51.090 --> 31:54.360
At the martin Marietta
astronautics company circa 1990.

31:55.926 --> 31:57.886
What baker and I did
was design a plan

31:57.895 --> 32:00.295
That would allow us to
do a human mars mission

32:00.297 --> 32:03.866
In just two launches of a
Saturn V heavy-lift booster,

32:03.867 --> 32:06.027
Okay, like the one we
used during Apollo.

32:08.036 --> 32:09.936
And before you know it,
you've created the beginning

32:09.938 --> 32:11.998
Of the first human
settlement on a new world.

32:12.006 --> 32:14.936
There's nothing in this that
is beyond our technology.

32:19.078 --> 32:22.448
Around that 1993, mike
griffin was appointed

32:22.449 --> 32:25.079
Associate administrator
for exploration,

32:25.084 --> 32:27.018
And he liked mars direct.

32:27.019 --> 32:29.019
He had us go back to
Johnson space center

32:29.021 --> 32:31.221
And talk to them
again with this time

32:31.223 --> 32:32.493
The people at
headquarters telling you

32:32.494 --> 32:33.990
That they had to listen,

32:33.991 --> 32:35.221
And they listened,

32:35.225 --> 32:36.885
And they came up with a
variant of mars direct

32:36.893 --> 32:38.362
As their new mars mission plan.

32:38.363 --> 32:40.161
And according to their analysis,

32:40.162 --> 32:42.962
It cut the cost of a human
mars exploration program

32:42.964 --> 32:45.999
By a factor of eight. Okay?

32:46.000 --> 32:48.400
Unfortunately by then,
Clinton was in office,

32:48.402 --> 32:51.102
And he wasn't interested, so
he told them to just shut up.

32:53.004 --> 32:56.107
You know, but the problem is,

32:56.108 --> 32:58.638
Is that we've never had a
situation where both NASA

32:58.643 --> 33:01.243
And the administration were
on board at the same time,

33:01.245 --> 33:03.035
Except during Apollo.

33:06.148 --> 33:07.548
My name is Michelle Stellhorn.

33:07.550 --> 33:10.220
I am a teacher in the
gifted education program

33:10.221 --> 33:12.149
Of the rockwood school district,

33:12.154 --> 33:15.289
And I teach a unit
called mission to mars.

33:15.290 --> 33:17.560
And we cover the
congressional space debate

33:17.561 --> 33:21.427
And the importance and
future of space exploration.

33:21.428 --> 33:24.028
Do you wanna be an astronaut?

33:24.030 --> 33:27.399
No, because I like earth,
and I want to stay on it,

33:27.400 --> 33:32.370
But I think that space
exploration is really cool.

33:32.371 --> 33:34.939
It's too expensive.

33:34.940 --> 33:39.376
We have national debt and
we have the job deficit.

33:39.377 --> 33:41.337
Do you think
that we should be spending

33:41.345 --> 33:44.175
More money and effort
in space exploration?

33:46.014 --> 33:48.616
Well, I think...

33:48.617 --> 33:50.077
I personally think we should,

33:50.085 --> 33:52.645
But I think that since
there's so many people

33:52.654 --> 33:54.354
Around the world
who are struggling

33:54.355 --> 33:55.945
To just put food on the table,

33:55.956 --> 33:58.116
I don't see how we can.

33:58.124 --> 34:01.362
I mean, we could, but there's
so many other problems

34:01.363 --> 34:05.029
That are major focuses that the
government should be studying,

34:05.030 --> 34:06.300
That should be working on.

34:06.301 --> 34:10.127
We need to get our
national debt paid off

34:10.134 --> 34:13.402
Before we can go and
play around in space.

34:13.402 --> 34:17.103
If given the opportunity,
if somebody said

34:17.106 --> 34:20.406
Do you wanna go to
space, would you go?

34:21.742 --> 34:25.742
Me, I think that depends
how much they pay me.

34:27.612 --> 34:30.282
Don't wanna be an astronaut,
what are they gonna fly?

34:30.283 --> 34:32.417
There's nothing to fly.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.717
There is no mars program.

34:34.719 --> 34:37.550
There is no astronaut program.

34:37.556 --> 34:39.416
There's casual talk about it.

34:39.424 --> 34:41.358
I know what a program is.

34:41.359 --> 34:43.759
I know when a man says,
"you're going to the moon,

34:43.761 --> 34:45.761
You're coming home
eight years from now,"

34:45.763 --> 34:47.733
I know what that means.

34:50.132 --> 34:52.232
The space
shuttle pulls into port

34:52.235 --> 34:56.094
For the last time,
its voyage at and end.

35:01.242 --> 35:03.580
You know, there's a lot
of people that think that

35:03.581 --> 35:05.238
The end of the shuttle program

35:05.246 --> 35:10.046
Was the end of America
going out into space.

35:11.216 --> 35:14.276
It's absurd, it's ridiculous.

35:14.286 --> 35:18.246
Flying a shuttle in circles around
the earth is not exploring.

35:18.256 --> 35:22.486
It's not pushing forward
the human frontier.

35:22.493 --> 35:24.793
You're simply making work.

35:24.795 --> 35:28.155
You're simply funneling
taxpayer money

35:28.165 --> 35:29.725
Into certain people's pockets

35:29.733 --> 35:32.201
Who are working in
different areas,

35:32.202 --> 35:35.237
Politicians,
aerospace companies,

35:35.238 --> 35:37.268
People who runs space centers.

35:37.273 --> 35:41.609
That's not what
this should be about,

35:41.610 --> 35:46.150
But that's what it's become
because there's no leadership...

35:47.113 --> 35:48.753
Because there's no vision.

35:56.820 --> 35:58.450
And Columbia, Houston,

35:58.456 --> 35:59.716
We see you tire
pressure messages,

35:59.723 --> 36:02.593
And we did not copy your last.

36:12.333 --> 36:14.703
Columbia, Houston, comm check.

36:17.170 --> 36:19.870
Columbia, Houston,
UHF comm check.

36:21.506 --> 36:24.406
Columbia, Houston,
UHF comm check.

36:25.709 --> 36:30.509
February 1st, 2003,
Columbia reenters tragically

36:30.514 --> 36:33.349
And breaks up over Texas.

36:33.350 --> 36:36.320
The notion that we could
continue flying the shuttle...

36:37.951 --> 36:40.521
For a long time went away.

36:50.462 --> 36:53.801
The commission that
investigated that accident said,

36:53.802 --> 36:56.669
"if you're going to be
risking human lives,

36:56.670 --> 36:59.668
"you really need to
explain what it is

36:59.671 --> 37:02.441
That you're trying to accomplish
in human spaceflight."

37:02.442 --> 37:06.676
Consistent with safety
concerns and the recommendations

37:06.677 --> 37:09.507
Of the Columbia accident
investigation board...

37:11.213 --> 37:13.851
The shuttle's chief purpose
of the next several years

37:13.852 --> 37:15.749
Will be to help finish assembly

37:15.750 --> 37:17.720
Of the international
space station.

37:19.618 --> 37:23.248
In 2010, the space shuttle,

37:23.255 --> 37:28.555
After nearly 30 years of duty,
will be retired from service.

37:28.559 --> 37:30.759
The first shuttle
tragedy made everybody stop

37:30.761 --> 37:33.899
And think exactly what it was
we were using the shuttle for,

37:33.900 --> 37:36.697
And did you really need
to have humans aboard

37:36.699 --> 37:39.399
A spacecraft in order
to launch satellites,

37:39.401 --> 37:42.269
And the second
tragedy, Columbia,

37:42.270 --> 37:43.900
Really brought it down
to a real focus on,

37:43.904 --> 37:47.439
"well, why are you doing
human spaceflight at all?"

37:47.440 --> 37:49.240
Using the crew
exploration vehicle,

37:49.241 --> 37:52.311
We will undertake extended
human missions to the moon

37:52.312 --> 37:54.440
As early as 2015,

37:54.445 --> 37:57.905
With the goal of living
and working there

37:57.915 --> 38:01.475
For increasingly
extended periods of time.

38:02.451 --> 38:05.420
See, I was...
I was there,

38:05.421 --> 38:08.691
I was literally in the room
when president bush announced

38:08.692 --> 38:11.358
We were gonna go back to
the moon and on to mars.

38:11.359 --> 38:12.659
And I'm a Texan,
I was close enough

38:12.660 --> 38:14.290
To where I could look at him.

38:14.294 --> 38:17.729
We're fairly good at
spotting BS in each other,

38:17.730 --> 38:19.860
And I think he really meant it.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.795
President bush
to his credit said,

38:22.801 --> 38:24.870
You know we're not gonna
just do this anymore,

38:24.871 --> 38:26.769
We're gonna do
something different,

38:26.770 --> 38:30.339
And we should go back
and we should explore.

38:30.340 --> 38:31.940
A powerful argument was made

38:31.941 --> 38:34.271
That what needed to happen

38:34.276 --> 38:37.336
Was we needed to start
making economic use

38:37.345 --> 38:40.045
Of all of the things
that we had found

38:40.047 --> 38:43.516
By all this taxpayer-funded
space exploration.

38:43.517 --> 38:46.047
If we want to start
going back to the moon,

38:46.052 --> 38:49.621
But this time for
economically useful purposes,

38:49.622 --> 38:51.889
How would we do that?

38:51.890 --> 38:54.990
And they came up with some
really interesting ideas,

38:54.993 --> 38:56.960
All of which were affordable,

38:56.961 --> 38:58.791
All of which were executable,

38:58.796 --> 39:00.726
All of which were
quite reasonable

39:00.731 --> 39:03.499
Paths that we could
have gone forward,

39:03.500 --> 39:06.300
None of which
looked like Apollo.

39:06.302 --> 39:09.402
And then he hired a
new NASA administrator,

39:09.405 --> 39:11.865
Who said he was
absolutely dedicated

39:11.874 --> 39:15.343
To carrying out the
president's vision,

39:15.344 --> 39:17.344
And that was
Dr. Michael griffin.

39:18.512 --> 39:20.447
And griffin came in and said,

39:20.448 --> 39:22.878
"I know how I'm
going to do this."

39:22.883 --> 39:24.350
And he had a plan.

39:24.351 --> 39:27.920
He had a way of getting
America back to the moon

39:27.921 --> 39:29.751
And then on to mars.

39:29.756 --> 39:31.416
It is very Apollo-like.

39:31.424 --> 39:33.462
It may have a different
shaped heat shield.

39:33.463 --> 39:35.728
It may have a different
surface contact system,

39:35.729 --> 39:39.057
But the outer mold line is very
Apollo-like, except larger.

39:39.063 --> 39:41.003
Think of it as
Apollo on steroids.

39:41.964 --> 39:44.499
Everything was tanked.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.570
All of the ideas were
dropped and ditched,

39:46.571 --> 39:51.338
Because mike griffin had his
own plan for "das program."

39:55.041 --> 39:58.011
NASA's new program
for human space exploration

39:58.012 --> 40:00.540
Is called constellation.

40:00.545 --> 40:02.905
For the first time
in a generation

40:02.914 --> 40:05.854
We will be traveling
beyond low earth orbit,

40:05.855 --> 40:07.517
Returning to the moon

40:07.518 --> 40:10.678
And expanding human
presence to mars.

40:12.486 --> 40:15.616
Exploration must
be taken in steps.

40:15.623 --> 40:18.091
Because we learn
from every journey,

40:18.092 --> 40:21.662
There is a link between
every place we go.

40:33.672 --> 40:36.908
Very quickly the
bush administration

40:36.909 --> 40:40.139
Started to cut back
on some of NASA's...

40:41.378 --> 40:43.608
Hoped for budget increases.

40:43.614 --> 40:45.754
That brought you to the
Obama administration

40:45.755 --> 40:47.449
In which they said...

40:47.450 --> 40:49.619
I understand that some
believe that we should attempt

40:49.620 --> 40:52.418
A return to the surface
of the moon first...

40:53.453 --> 40:55.753
As previously planned.

40:55.756 --> 40:59.586
But I just have to say,
pretty bluntly here...

41:00.892 --> 41:02.660
We've been there before.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.931
Will American astronauts
return to the moon

41:04.932 --> 41:06.729
In the foreseeable future?

41:06.730 --> 41:07.930
NBC news has learned

41:07.931 --> 41:09.701
That plans to travel
there and beyond

41:09.702 --> 41:14.169
The white house was
willing to support the vision

41:14.170 --> 41:16.170
Of returning to the moon by 2020

41:16.172 --> 41:19.072
And going on to mars verbally,

41:19.074 --> 41:22.876
But not when it came down
to the nation's pocketbook.

41:22.877 --> 41:25.507
It had been known from the start

41:25.512 --> 41:28.182
That the constellation
could not be executed

41:28.183 --> 41:30.781
On anything like
NASA's current budget.

41:30.783 --> 41:33.751
The assumption
was made that NASA

41:33.752 --> 41:36.590
Would receive a very
substantial budget increase

41:36.591 --> 41:39.518
In order to do something
like constellation.

41:39.524 --> 41:41.624
When president
Obama came into office,

41:41.626 --> 41:43.156
He set up this committee

41:43.160 --> 41:45.590
To take a look at the
constellation program

41:45.595 --> 41:47.895
And that committee
determined that technically

41:47.897 --> 41:50.427
The constellation program
was doing quite well,

41:50.432 --> 41:52.532
But that there
wasn't enough money.

41:52.534 --> 41:55.669
The budget for that
program had been reduced

41:55.670 --> 41:58.200
Substantially every single
year since it started,

41:58.205 --> 42:03.165
And as a result, our look
at the constellation program

42:03.176 --> 42:08.506
That we were then pursuing was
that it was not executable.

42:08.514 --> 42:11.154
The program was on a
trajectory to fail.

42:11.155 --> 42:15.519
We did recommend that either
NASA's budget be increased,

42:15.520 --> 42:16.950
Rather substantially,

42:16.954 --> 42:19.454
Or that they should be
given some other mission

42:19.456 --> 42:21.756
That they can do within
their current budget.

42:21.758 --> 42:26.228
Everyone agrees that
there's a $3 billion shortfall

42:26.229 --> 42:28.729
In what we need to
accomplish our goals.

42:30.131 --> 42:35.501
Of what you have suggested as
alternatives, other options,

42:35.503 --> 42:41.173
Are any of those accomplishable
without that shortfall?

42:42.942 --> 42:45.511
Do you wanna deal with that?

42:45.512 --> 42:47.546
- No.
- Okay, there you go.

42:47.547 --> 42:49.047
The white house was
not willing to invest

42:49.048 --> 42:52.748
Congress was not willing to
invest that kind of money in it,

42:52.751 --> 42:54.781
So the constellation
program was canceled.

42:54.786 --> 43:00.516
The reason we were unable
to sustain humanity in space

43:00.524 --> 43:02.624
Or on the moon after Apollo,

43:02.626 --> 43:04.626
Was there was no
decision to do so...

43:06.095 --> 43:10.695
And there was no technology
that was designed

43:10.700 --> 43:15.537
To allow us to do so because
the decision was not there.

43:15.538 --> 43:17.938
Interestingly, in the
constellation program

43:17.940 --> 43:23.240
And under president bush, he
said, "we're going to establish"

43:23.244 --> 43:25.914
Human permanence
beyond the earth."

43:27.580 --> 43:30.716
Unfortunately, the
people in charge

43:30.717 --> 43:34.047
Were unable to understand
what that meant,

43:34.053 --> 43:37.153
And instead redesigned a bigger,

43:37.156 --> 43:40.816
Badder version of
the Apollo program.

43:40.826 --> 43:44.086
It was doomed to failure
from the beginning.

43:52.734 --> 43:54.569
September of 2011,

43:54.570 --> 43:58.039
NASA proposes a new capability
for human exploration,

43:58.040 --> 44:01.070
A massive rocket, the
largest ever built,

44:01.076 --> 44:04.836
For a variety of missions
beyond low earth orbit.

44:04.846 --> 44:06.806
When president Obama announced

44:06.814 --> 44:08.814
That he was canceling
constellation,

44:08.816 --> 44:12.816
What he wanted to do
was to wait five years

44:12.820 --> 44:16.120
And invest in game-
changing technologies,

44:16.123 --> 44:18.290
And after that period of time

44:18.291 --> 44:20.591
A decision would be made
as to what new rockets

44:20.593 --> 44:21.762
Or spacecraft were needed

44:21.763 --> 44:23.560
To go wherever it is the nation

44:23.561 --> 44:25.401
Was gonna go next in
human spaceflight.

44:25.402 --> 44:27.757
And that presupposed
in five years

44:27.766 --> 44:29.896
You could do something
that essentially

44:29.901 --> 44:32.001
Obsoletes chemical propulsion.

44:32.003 --> 44:35.103
We will increase
investment right away

44:35.106 --> 44:37.106
In other groundbreaking
technologies

44:37.108 --> 44:38.808
That will allow astronauts

44:38.809 --> 44:41.109
To reach space sooner
and more often.

44:41.111 --> 44:42.911
Well, there was
nothing in the pipeline

44:42.912 --> 44:44.281
At all that would do that.

44:44.282 --> 44:46.810
I mean, there was discussion
of what might be.

44:46.815 --> 44:49.775
There was some hypotheses
of what could be done,

44:49.784 --> 44:51.284
But now we're five years later

44:51.285 --> 44:53.075
And there really was
nothing in the pipeline

44:53.086 --> 44:55.046
That was even remotely
mature enough.

44:55.054 --> 44:56.823
And congress hated that idea.

44:56.824 --> 44:59.862
Congress felt it was really
important to have a destination

44:59.863 --> 45:02.926
And a time frame
within which to meet

45:02.927 --> 45:06.257
Specific visionary goals
for human spaceflight

45:06.263 --> 45:08.963
And so congress wrote into law

45:08.965 --> 45:11.895
Directing NASA to
build a new big rocket,

45:11.901 --> 45:14.101
Which they called the
space launch system,

45:14.103 --> 45:17.138
And to build a
multi-purpose crew vehicle,

45:17.139 --> 45:19.206
Which we know as Orion,

45:19.207 --> 45:21.467
In order to provide
the capabilities

45:21.475 --> 45:26.175
To keep a vigorous human
spaceflight program going.

45:26.179 --> 45:28.379
So constellation was canceled

45:28.381 --> 45:31.049
But congress promptly reinstated

45:31.050 --> 45:34.020
The all the expensive parts
of it under new names...

45:35.953 --> 45:38.253
But did not give NASA
the budget increase

45:38.256 --> 45:40.856
That would be necessary
to fly missions with them.

45:40.858 --> 45:41.988
Do you know what the budget

45:41.992 --> 45:44.827
For the SLS launch system is?

45:44.828 --> 45:46.328
Uh, I...

45:46.329 --> 45:48.829
We don't know, so you don't
know either, quite frankly.

45:48.831 --> 45:50.461
- That was a leading question.
- -all right.

45:50.465 --> 45:52.425
And if that money
was gonna be taken

45:52.433 --> 45:56.133
Out of your budget to develop
the SLS launch system,

45:56.136 --> 45:58.166
Rather than go with
the launch systems

45:58.171 --> 46:01.241
That we've already got, would
you be supportive of that?

46:02.240 --> 46:03.940
- No.
- Right.

46:03.942 --> 46:06.080
We really don't have
a lot of momentum

46:06.081 --> 46:07.507
And a lot of vision on what

46:07.511 --> 46:09.111
Space launch system is gonna do.

46:09.112 --> 46:12.180
It's been pegged
"the rocket to nowhere."

46:12.181 --> 46:14.351
When they finally
get it upgraded

46:14.352 --> 46:19.319
To 130 metric tons,
which may be 2025,

46:19.320 --> 46:23.220
It will be equivalent and
almost equal to a Saturn V,

46:23.223 --> 46:27.392
Which we will have
had 60 years earlier.

46:27.393 --> 46:30.363
We're talking about
after proving one flight,

46:30.364 --> 46:33.762
That we might do an
orbit around the moon

46:33.765 --> 46:35.255
Called Apollo 8.

46:37.367 --> 46:39.067
You're keeping
space station alive,

46:39.069 --> 46:41.099
You're supporting the
various NASA centers,

46:41.104 --> 46:43.074
You got two piece of
hardware you're developing,

46:43.075 --> 46:44.972
But they have no destination

46:44.973 --> 46:47.013
And they're like what
we did 60 years ago.

46:49.075 --> 46:51.405
I always call it
a rocket to anywhere

46:51.411 --> 46:54.079
Because it's just
like the shuttle.

46:54.080 --> 46:56.050
When the shuttle was designed,

46:56.051 --> 47:00.148
It was designed to be a
shuttle of capability.

47:00.152 --> 47:03.020
It didn't have
payloads identified.

47:03.021 --> 47:05.921
All those missions
were nonexistent...

47:06.956 --> 47:08.456
On the day the
first shuttle flew.

47:10.559 --> 47:12.359
If space is a frontier...

47:13.894 --> 47:16.563
And I shall hereby
declare it to be so,

47:16.564 --> 47:19.933
And your goal is to
settle the frontier...

47:19.934 --> 47:23.136
In other words, for
people to live there

47:23.137 --> 47:27.467
Like they do here in what
used to be a frontier...

47:29.040 --> 47:31.409
Then you have to create

47:31.410 --> 47:34.010
A means for that to occur.

47:35.245 --> 47:38.505
No frontier has
never been opened

47:38.515 --> 47:41.045
Based on the development
and operation

47:41.050 --> 47:44.220
Of a single giant
government vehicle.

47:46.519 --> 47:48.549
They can launch two to three...

47:48.555 --> 47:52.915
At least two and potentially
three SLS"s per year.

47:52.926 --> 47:55.956
They can build that many and
they can launch that many.

47:55.962 --> 47:58.202
That's the way the design
of the infrastructure

47:58.203 --> 48:02.166
And the vehicle and the
assembly plant is set up to do,

48:02.167 --> 48:05.127
But they need more funding.

48:05.136 --> 48:06.996
To date, unfortunately,

48:07.004 --> 48:08.344
The budget has
not been increased,

48:08.345 --> 48:10.398
And that's a major concern.

48:10.406 --> 48:13.066
It's been a major
concern since day one,

48:13.075 --> 48:16.575
And if there's anything
our commission emphasized,

48:16.578 --> 48:19.846
It was that we have
to have a budget

48:19.847 --> 48:23.216
And a space program that are
consistent with each other.

48:23.217 --> 48:26.447
And unfortunately,
throughout the human

48:26.453 --> 48:30.153
Space flight history,
for a couple of decades,

48:30.156 --> 48:32.416
That's not been the case.

48:32.424 --> 48:34.924
Tonight, NASA
announced further cuts

48:34.926 --> 48:37.086
Have been ordered
in its new budget

48:37.094 --> 48:38.363
And one effect will be a delay

48:38.364 --> 48:40.431
In the timetable for
the space shuttle.

48:40.432 --> 48:43.459
50,000 employees are
not looking forward.

48:43.465 --> 48:45.155
They're looking elsewhere.

48:45.166 --> 48:47.866
If this country really
needs another expensive

48:47.868 --> 48:49.628
Piece of hardware in orbit,

48:49.636 --> 48:51.096
When here on the ground,

48:51.104 --> 48:52.641
We can hardly get
the mail delivered.

48:52.642 --> 48:54.298
Congress
cut the shuttle's budget

48:54.306 --> 48:57.306
By $234 million.

48:57.309 --> 48:59.439
Already there have
been some cutbacks

48:59.444 --> 49:00.981
And there could be others.

49:00.982 --> 49:02.578
It is, without question,

49:02.579 --> 49:04.209
The biggest waste
of money I've seen

49:04.213 --> 49:06.082
Since I've been on the
united state senate.

49:06.083 --> 49:08.611
Today, president Clinton
put in his latest bid.

49:08.616 --> 49:11.146
He outlined $13
billion in savings

49:11.151 --> 49:13.051
At four federal agencies,

49:13.052 --> 49:15.252
More than half the cuts at NASA.

49:15.254 --> 49:17.024
The bailout, the bank bailout,

49:17.025 --> 49:18.956
That sum of money is greater

49:18.957 --> 49:21.457
Than the entire 50 year

49:21.459 --> 49:23.959
- Running budget of NASA.
- -wow.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.091
I think we have to be realistic

49:25.095 --> 49:26.425
When it comes to the budget.

49:26.429 --> 49:28.259
If we need additional funds
for a heavy lift rocket,

49:28.264 --> 49:30.031
We're going to have
to set priorities

49:30.032 --> 49:32.272
And have to shift funds from
other parts of the program.

49:32.273 --> 49:36.467
I don't think that NASA
or our space program

49:36.471 --> 49:40.307
Is somehow going to
defy budget gravity

49:40.308 --> 49:42.638
And be the only agency
to get an increase

49:42.643 --> 49:45.981
When every other agency is
either gonna be flat-lined

49:45.982 --> 49:48.409
Or be subject to the
budgetary constraints.

49:48.414 --> 49:50.614
So I think we're just
gonna have to be smarter.

49:50.616 --> 49:52.276
We're going to have to make sure

49:52.284 --> 49:54.118
We don't have cost overruns

49:54.119 --> 49:56.119
And we're gonna have
to set priorities

49:56.121 --> 49:57.951
And use the money
that we do have better

49:57.956 --> 49:59.256
And then we can get the funds,

49:59.257 --> 50:00.987
Say for a heavy lift rocket.

50:00.992 --> 50:02.422
If we started today,

50:02.426 --> 50:05.186
How long do each of you
estimate it would be

50:05.195 --> 50:08.695
Before we could place
a person on mars?

50:08.698 --> 50:10.958
With the current budget?

50:10.966 --> 50:13.266
Yes. Give me a
date with the current budget

50:13.268 --> 50:15.568
And a date with the
Apollo-era budget.

50:17.337 --> 50:20.637
With the current budget... bear with
me... I would probably say never.

50:20.641 --> 50:22.071
Hey...

50:23.275 --> 50:24.375
China.

50:24.377 --> 50:27.707
Can we borrow some money
to finish our mars trip?

50:31.615 --> 50:34.015
You know, with
constellation, mike griffin,

50:34.018 --> 50:35.548
And now people with the SLS,

50:35.552 --> 50:38.720
Just assume that if
we develop the SLS,

50:38.721 --> 50:40.451
It will fly forever.

50:41.722 --> 50:44.122
We had the Saturn V.

50:45.358 --> 50:47.058
It worked.

50:48.326 --> 50:51.056
It was flying humans
to the moon...

50:52.196 --> 50:54.026
And we canceled it.

51:01.336 --> 51:03.596
When did we last
leave low-earth orbit,

51:03.605 --> 51:05.095
You know, a couple
hundred miles up

51:05.106 --> 51:08.336
Where the space station
space shuttle orbit...

51:09.375 --> 51:11.375
To go somewhere
interesting with humans?

51:11.378 --> 51:14.508
When did we last do it?
1972, Apollo 17.

51:14.514 --> 51:16.714
It's been more than four decades

51:16.716 --> 51:21.476
Since we've left earth
for another destination.

51:21.486 --> 51:23.086
What's the problem?

51:23.087 --> 51:25.617
What are we missing?
Is it political will?

51:25.622 --> 51:27.392
Is it motivation?
Is it money?

51:27.393 --> 51:29.490
Is it... are we distracted?

51:29.492 --> 51:31.162
Are there other issues?

51:32.493 --> 51:34.428
We went to the moon...

51:34.429 --> 51:37.329
In the 1960s!

51:39.031 --> 51:41.671
What, we didn't have
problems in the 1960s?

52:04.588 --> 52:07.118
We were at a hot war
in southeast Asia,

52:07.124 --> 52:09.593
A cold war with
the soviet union,

52:09.594 --> 52:12.364
The civil rights movement
was fully under way,

52:12.365 --> 52:14.197
There was campus unrest,

52:14.198 --> 52:16.428
There were riots in
the urban centers.

52:17.900 --> 52:20.170
It shall be the policy
of this nation

52:20.171 --> 52:22.537
To regard any nuclear missile

52:22.538 --> 52:24.798
Launched from Cuba
against any nation

52:24.806 --> 52:26.666
In the western hemisphere

52:26.674 --> 52:30.281
As an attack by the soviet
union on the United States.

52:30.282 --> 52:32.507
We had the greatest problems
the country has seen

52:32.512 --> 52:34.446
Since the civil war

52:34.447 --> 52:37.247
And in that climate,
on that landscape,

52:37.249 --> 52:38.579
We went to the moon.

52:38.583 --> 52:39.883
So don't turn around and tell me

52:39.884 --> 52:41.353
That these past four decades

52:41.354 --> 52:43.152
We've had challenges
we couldn't overcome.

52:43.153 --> 52:44.722
That's why we're not
going into space.

52:44.723 --> 52:47.391
No, that's not the reason
we're not going into space.

52:59.500 --> 53:04.438
It is the most natural
question in the world to say...

53:04.439 --> 53:06.939
You know, if you're a young
person in this country,

53:06.941 --> 53:09.411
"wait a second, we
were on the moon?

53:10.810 --> 53:13.410
"American citizens
were walking around,

53:13.413 --> 53:15.313
"jumping around on the moon?

53:15.314 --> 53:18.849
"They were driving a
golf cart on the moon?

53:18.850 --> 53:21.250
"They brought back
hundreds of pounds

53:21.252 --> 53:24.352
"of specially
selected rock samples

53:24.355 --> 53:27.485
"to see what the geological
history of the moon was...

53:28.790 --> 53:30.390
"and you stopped?

53:31.358 --> 53:32.858
"Why did you stop?

53:34.227 --> 53:36.287
Are you people nuts?"

53:36.296 --> 53:38.256
My read of history
tells me there's only

53:38.264 --> 53:39.964
Two, maybe three motivations

53:39.965 --> 53:41.755
For ever doing
something so grand

53:41.766 --> 53:42.966
And one of them is war.

53:45.301 --> 53:48.937
The other is money.
Let's do it for money.

53:48.938 --> 53:50.838
If you can do it for
money, it'll happen.

53:50.839 --> 53:54.409
I've never seen anyone
do it to explore.

53:55.509 --> 53:58.539
There is a growing
tendency to think of man

53:58.546 --> 54:02.806
As a rational thinking
being, which is absurd.

54:02.816 --> 54:05.376
There is simply no evidence
of any intelligence

54:05.385 --> 54:06.645
On the earth.

54:06.652 --> 54:09.352
Mm-hmm, wait!

54:23.266 --> 54:27.966
Why did we stop
producing Saturn V rockets?

54:29.570 --> 54:32.906
It's one of the great
mysteries to me.

54:32.907 --> 54:37.377
The Saturn V rocket
can put more mass

54:37.378 --> 54:42.408
Into low-earth orbit
than our shuttle.

54:42.415 --> 54:45.375
It had been a
natural to help build

54:45.384 --> 54:47.424
The international space station.

54:52.421 --> 54:54.421
The Saturn V was a
really unique rocket

54:54.424 --> 54:56.364
In the sense that it was really

54:56.365 --> 54:59.689
The first rocket
designed for exploration.

54:59.695 --> 55:02.355
The mercury project's
launched on a red-stone,

55:02.364 --> 55:04.364
Which was an intermediate-range
ballistic missile.

55:04.366 --> 55:06.426
It was modified.
Then the Gemini

55:06.434 --> 55:08.734
Went up on a titan,
which was an ICBM.

55:08.736 --> 55:11.736
So, the Saturn program was
really the first rocket

55:11.739 --> 55:13.339
That was never designed

55:13.340 --> 55:15.010
To be launching missiles
on other people.

55:15.011 --> 55:17.038
It was actually the first
one that was designed

55:17.043 --> 55:20.011
To launch people to
new destinations.

55:20.012 --> 55:22.712
So the Saturn V was a
leap beyond anything

55:22.714 --> 55:24.384
That had been seen before.

55:25.715 --> 55:29.475
It had five million-and-a-
half-pound thrust engines

55:29.486 --> 55:31.046
On just the first stage.

55:31.054 --> 55:32.721
The second stage had five

55:32.722 --> 55:35.460
Quarter-million-pound thrust
hydrogen engines on it,

55:35.461 --> 55:37.318
And had a third
stage with another

55:37.326 --> 55:38.586
Quarter-million-pound thrust.

55:38.593 --> 55:42.393
It was something that had
never been done before

55:42.396 --> 55:44.556
And it worked very well

55:44.564 --> 55:46.531
And it was able to do things

55:46.532 --> 55:48.372
That nothing could
have been able to do

55:48.373 --> 55:50.397
And nothing can do today.

56:00.376 --> 56:02.676
We have a tendency
in this country,

56:02.679 --> 56:05.409
Like "the tortoise
and the hare."

56:05.415 --> 56:06.845
We are the hare.

56:06.849 --> 56:08.379
We build something,
we do something,

56:08.383 --> 56:10.683
We go back and try
something else.

56:10.685 --> 56:12.945
Look, folks, modern design!

56:12.953 --> 56:14.787
Whoo, whoo, whoo hoo!

56:14.788 --> 56:16.818
The Russians, in the meanwhile,

56:16.823 --> 56:18.557
Are the tortoise.

56:18.558 --> 56:21.358
They build something,
they keep it going.

56:21.360 --> 56:23.490
Do you know that the booster,

56:23.495 --> 56:29.695
The rocket that put Yuri
Krekorian up in space in 1961

56:29.700 --> 56:32.768
Is basically the same vehicle

56:32.769 --> 56:36.338
That's putting our astronauts
and their cosmonauts

56:36.339 --> 56:39.669
Into the international
space station today?

56:39.675 --> 56:41.635
The same vehicle,

56:41.643 --> 56:44.378
And yet, we don't keep ours.

56:44.379 --> 56:46.509
The Saturn V could
have been improved.

56:46.514 --> 56:49.782
That'd been a good
stepping stone towards

56:49.783 --> 56:52.050
Going back to the moon.

56:52.051 --> 56:55.520
We could have improved
the lunar module.

56:55.521 --> 56:57.788
We couldn't done lots of things

56:57.789 --> 57:00.589
To the Saturn V to upgrade it,

57:00.591 --> 57:04.561
And we'd have had, still, a
viable lunar program going.

57:05.727 --> 57:07.357
It's a tragedy,

57:07.362 --> 57:09.432
And I'll mention that every
time that someone tells me.

57:09.433 --> 57:13.670
It's a tragedy that we stopped
building the Saturn V rocket.

57:20.505 --> 57:23.565
The decision to stop
production of the Saturn V

57:23.575 --> 57:27.675
Dates back really to the
Lyndon Johnson administration.

57:27.679 --> 57:30.709
The space agency, facing
severe budget restrictions,

57:30.715 --> 57:33.475
Has decided to cut back
Apollo moon landing missions

57:33.484 --> 57:34.724
To two flights a year.

57:34.725 --> 57:36.618
NASA had stopped ordering

57:36.619 --> 57:40.819
Long lead-time items
for the Saturn V in 1968

57:40.823 --> 57:45.059
And announced suspension
of its production.

57:45.060 --> 57:47.160
There were 15 built,
and then there weren't

57:47.162 --> 57:48.529
Gonna be any more.

57:48.530 --> 57:51.030
Then there were
ambitious recommendations

57:51.032 --> 57:53.400
To Nixon in September of '69

57:53.401 --> 57:56.870
To use mars as a long-term
goal of the program

57:56.871 --> 57:59.101
And build a space station.

58:00.739 --> 58:04.709
Those recommendations were
rejected in the fall of '69,

58:04.710 --> 58:07.810
And then there was no need for

58:07.813 --> 58:11.083
The kind of capability
represented by the Saturn V,

58:11.084 --> 58:15.852
So it was in the budget
cycle in December of 1969

58:15.853 --> 58:19.593
That the decision finally was
made to suspend production,

58:19.594 --> 58:21.960
Basically shut the program down.

58:57.558 --> 58:59.158
We had a president who was

58:59.159 --> 59:03.089
Not particularly interested
in the space program.

59:03.096 --> 59:09.196
We had a... Vietnam war that
was picking up a lot of money

59:09.201 --> 59:15.201
And... So as soon as
the NASA budget

59:15.206 --> 59:19.236
For Apollo began to
drop off a little,

59:19.243 --> 59:21.711
The white house looked at it

59:21.712 --> 59:23.242
Like a big place to get money.

59:48.836 --> 59:51.166
Thomas Paine, administrator
of the space agency,

59:51.171 --> 59:53.541
Said today that 50,000
people will be dropped

59:53.542 --> 59:55.070
And the space
program stretched out

59:55.074 --> 59:59.844
"very stringent budget cuts
ordered by president Nixon."

59:59.845 --> 01:00:01.705
Most of those who
will lose their jobs

01:00:01.713 --> 01:00:03.613
Work for private contractors,

01:00:03.614 --> 01:00:05.584
The rest for the space agency.

01:00:05.585 --> 01:00:09.918
Paine said production of the
Saturn V rocket will be ended.

01:00:09.919 --> 01:00:11.719
The last one will
be used to launch

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.750
An experimental space station.

01:00:13.755 --> 01:00:18.685
At the Marshall space flight
center in Huntsville, Alabama.

01:00:52.657 --> 01:00:55.826
The idea of going to
mars was not selling.

01:00:55.827 --> 01:00:58.627
Putting a base on the
moon was not selling.

01:00:58.629 --> 01:01:01.099
We weren't gonna get
the big space station.

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:03.628
We knew we weren't gonna
get the nuclear rocket.

01:01:03.633 --> 01:01:05.733
With the Apollo
program doing so well,

01:01:05.735 --> 01:01:07.965
We thought we would be
able to at least continue

01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:12.270
With the sort of budget support
that we had had for Apollo,

01:01:12.274 --> 01:01:16.010
Which had been terrific,
and... Didn't happen,

01:01:16.011 --> 01:01:19.611
And so we were pretty
depressed group for a while.

01:01:19.614 --> 01:01:21.914
Saturn V, Saturn IB,

01:01:21.916 --> 01:01:24.746
Command module...
all disappeared.

01:01:26.185 --> 01:01:28.085
And there will be a
mission to mars someday,

01:01:28.087 --> 01:01:30.017
But I don't know when.

01:01:30.022 --> 01:01:32.062
50 years from now maybe.

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:50.839
When I look at
the present direction

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.840
Of our space program today...

01:01:53.875 --> 01:01:55.805
I feel disappointed.

01:01:55.811 --> 01:01:59.711
I feel that our
leaders don't really

01:01:59.714 --> 01:02:03.283
Have a good reason
for continuing it.

01:02:03.284 --> 01:02:08.187
I think that... that it's not
their desire to really have

01:02:08.188 --> 01:02:13.018
A first-class, first-rate program
that they can be proud of

01:02:13.026 --> 01:02:17.496
And we look at ways that we
waste money in this country

01:02:17.497 --> 01:02:20.027
When we could put it to good use

01:02:20.032 --> 01:02:22.967
In a program that
everybody really...

01:02:22.968 --> 01:02:26.038
The average individual...
really wants to see done,

01:02:26.039 --> 01:02:29.097
Then it... it kind of
makes me feel sad.

01:02:29.106 --> 01:02:31.136
Today, we stand on
the shoulders of giants.

01:02:32.141 --> 01:02:34.877
And we have to
honor those people.

01:02:34.878 --> 01:02:37.138
I know a lot of
Apollo astronauts.

01:02:37.146 --> 01:02:39.946
They're pretty pissed off...

01:02:39.948 --> 01:02:41.778
'cause they did their job,

01:02:41.783 --> 01:02:43.420
They did what they
were asked to do,

01:02:43.421 --> 01:02:45.077
They put their
lives on the line.

01:02:45.085 --> 01:02:48.215
They went out and they did
something incredible...

01:02:48.221 --> 01:02:50.889
And then nothing happened.

01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:55.290
Can NASA mount a project?
Can they do a project anymore?

01:02:55.294 --> 01:02:58.362
Or does the project
become so politicized

01:02:58.363 --> 01:03:00.233
And so wrapped up in Washington

01:03:00.234 --> 01:03:03.431
That it gets strangulated
and can't happen?

01:03:03.434 --> 01:03:05.904
Unfortunately, I
come from the '60s.

01:03:07.937 --> 01:03:11.167
I'm not cynical.
I come from the '60s...

01:03:11.174 --> 01:03:14.344
The greatest project management
the world has ever seen

01:03:14.345 --> 01:03:16.283
On any project, and we did it.

01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:20.012
We did it urgently.

01:03:20.014 --> 01:03:22.054
We did it on cost, on schedule,

01:03:22.055 --> 01:03:28.149
Even with 45 years of hindsight
history, we did it right.

01:03:28.155 --> 01:03:31.055
I believe that when we landed

01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:34.826
On the moon in 1969
as a flight tracker,

01:03:34.827 --> 01:03:38.196
My children would see an
American back on the moon.

01:03:38.197 --> 01:03:41.327
I'm starting to
lose that belief.

01:03:41.333 --> 01:03:43.073
I had hoped that I
would see it myself.

01:03:43.074 --> 01:03:45.938
That is now... Impossible.

01:03:47.003 --> 01:03:50.940
Ironically, going to the moon

01:03:50.941 --> 01:03:54.241
Could have been a
natural continuation

01:03:54.244 --> 01:03:57.012
Of the westward migration

01:03:57.013 --> 01:03:59.280
That began with the 13 colonies

01:03:59.281 --> 01:04:04.117
And continued to the
end of the 1800s,

01:04:04.118 --> 01:04:06.418
But we didn't do it that way.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.950
We had a government
planned crisis project

01:04:09.956 --> 01:04:13.356
Instead of opening up
space like a frontier.

01:04:13.359 --> 01:04:14.929
You realized during the entire

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:17.127
Golden age of space exploration

01:04:17.129 --> 01:04:19.129
That we generally
associate with the 1960s

01:04:19.131 --> 01:04:21.098
And the voyage to the moon,

01:04:21.099 --> 01:04:23.369
We remember ourselves
as pioneers in that era,

01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:27.067
But in fact, we were reactive...

01:04:28.236 --> 01:04:31.066
To the statements
made by the soviets

01:04:31.073 --> 01:04:35.576
Rather than proactive in
fulfillment of dreams we had.

01:04:35.577 --> 01:04:38.077
They put up a satellite, we
gotta put up a satellite.

01:04:38.079 --> 01:04:40.179
They put a animal...
non-human animal in orbit,

01:04:40.181 --> 01:04:41.881
We put a non-human animal.

01:04:41.882 --> 01:04:45.517
They put up a first human,
we put up a first human.

01:04:45.518 --> 01:04:47.178
This went on and on and on

01:04:47.186 --> 01:04:50.286
With Russia beating us in
practically everything.

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:54.519
Then we get to the moon before they did.
We said, "we win."

01:04:58.361 --> 01:05:01.861
If that's how we look at it,
we didn't understand...

01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:07.070
Who was pioneering that race.

01:05:10.436 --> 01:05:15.006
So, we are better at
reacting than pro-acting.

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:17.910
Given that fact,
we may have to sink

01:05:17.911 --> 01:05:22.609
Deeper into economic...
Poverty as a nation

01:05:22.613 --> 01:05:24.981
Before we wake up and say,

01:05:24.982 --> 01:05:26.882
"we gotta do
something about this."

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:33.117
It's an unfortunate
fact of how we function.

01:05:33.121 --> 01:05:35.151
You know, there's a
generation out there right now

01:05:35.156 --> 01:05:37.076
That doesn't believe we've
ever been to the moon.

01:05:38.057 --> 01:05:41.257
Now, that's not
because the shadows

01:05:41.261 --> 01:05:43.961
From the flag fall the wrong way

01:05:43.963 --> 01:05:46.197
Or the lens flare is wrong

01:05:46.198 --> 01:05:49.528
Or you can't see the stars
because of the contrast ratio

01:05:49.534 --> 01:05:52.674
Or this or that or the
other or anything like that.

01:05:52.675 --> 01:05:58.370
The real reason that any
of that... Sticks at all...

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:02.009
Is that we're not there now...

01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:03.610
And it's incredibly
hard to believe

01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:05.981
That if we ever did
something that magnificent,

01:06:05.982 --> 01:06:08.410
That exciting,
that inspirational...

01:06:09.915 --> 01:06:12.345
Why did we stop?

01:06:12.351 --> 01:06:15.351
That's the reason there's people
who believe we never went.

01:06:15.354 --> 01:06:18.422
Why aren't we there now?

01:06:18.423 --> 01:06:21.958
It's peace time, Jim. The government isn't
making that kind of appropriations.

01:06:21.959 --> 01:06:23.589
Oh, they'll need the
rocket one of these days

01:06:23.593 --> 01:06:25.633
And if it's not ready, the
government will do the job.

01:06:25.634 --> 01:06:28.997
And they'll turn to you, to
private industry, to do it.

01:06:28.998 --> 01:06:31.228
Government always does
that when it gets in a jam.

01:06:31.233 --> 01:06:37.037
I figured we might be
ready for the government.

01:06:37.038 --> 01:06:41.068
The British government
explored Hudson bay.

01:06:41.075 --> 01:06:44.005
Then, the Hudson bay
company was created.

01:06:44.011 --> 01:06:46.381
The us government
explores the moon,

01:06:46.382 --> 01:06:50.049
Then the lunar,
Gofindlunarrocks. Com

01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:51.980
Company will get created.

01:06:51.985 --> 01:06:55.115
We have companies now,
space-x leading the way,

01:06:55.121 --> 01:06:57.451
Bringing cargo to and
from the space station.

01:06:57.456 --> 01:07:00.186
That should have been
happening decades ago.

01:07:00.192 --> 01:07:02.732
You don't need astronauts
to serve as truck drivers

01:07:02.733 --> 01:07:05.157
Hauling cargo back and forth.

01:07:05.162 --> 01:07:07.100
An unmanned vehicle can do that

01:07:07.101 --> 01:07:09.557
And let the commercial
marketplace take care of it.

01:07:09.566 --> 01:07:11.226
Let them bid for that.

01:07:11.234 --> 01:07:13.034
They can do it faster,
cheaper, better,

01:07:13.035 --> 01:07:16.195
Than any government program
could do it, for sure.

01:07:16.204 --> 01:07:18.574
When airplanes were
first beginning,

01:07:18.575 --> 01:07:21.341
A very smart group
of people decided

01:07:21.342 --> 01:07:23.042
That they were not going to...

01:07:23.043 --> 01:07:25.513
America was not going
to own its own fleet,

01:07:25.514 --> 01:07:26.742
Its own airline.

01:07:26.746 --> 01:07:28.546
It said, "what we're
gonna do is help build"

01:07:28.547 --> 01:07:31.307
The airline industry and
the airplane industry,"

01:07:31.316 --> 01:07:33.316
And they did that by
simply guaranteeing

01:07:33.318 --> 01:07:34.518
A certain amount of mail

01:07:34.519 --> 01:07:37.149
That was gonna be
traveling on airplanes.

01:07:37.154 --> 01:07:39.454
And what happened was
that an industry developed

01:07:39.456 --> 01:07:41.386
Here America became
the leading country

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:44.059
And the leading
technology developer

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:47.260
Of what we now know
as modern aviation.

01:08:00.574 --> 01:08:02.274
People should be able to come up

01:08:02.276 --> 01:08:05.036
With creative, beneficial things

01:08:05.045 --> 01:08:08.175
That they can figure
out how to afford to do

01:08:08.181 --> 01:08:12.281
And if there's science involved
that can benefit the country

01:08:12.285 --> 01:08:14.785
And the federal government
can get involved,

01:08:14.787 --> 01:08:17.386
If there's technology
that needs to be developed

01:08:17.389 --> 01:08:21.019
That can help people, the
government can get involved there.

01:08:21.024 --> 01:08:24.125
We could have partnerships
and we can move out.

01:08:24.127 --> 01:08:26.328
We can have the 21st
century equivalent

01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:28.660
Of the transcontinental
railroad,

01:08:28.665 --> 01:08:31.665
Which by the way, was
built by private companies

01:08:31.667 --> 01:08:34.598
Without a government
department of railroads

01:08:34.604 --> 01:08:36.174
Telling them how to do it.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.768
We did it with land grants.

01:08:38.773 --> 01:08:41.173
Well, we could do the
same thing in space.

01:08:41.175 --> 01:08:43.234
We could do the same sort of

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:45.143
Innovative
partnerships in space.

01:08:45.144 --> 01:08:48.412
From this sort of
bureaucratic mindset

01:08:48.412 --> 01:08:51.451
That it needs to be a government
program to do it for us.

01:08:51.452 --> 01:08:54.749
The vast amount of brains,
talents, special skills,

01:08:54.752 --> 01:08:57.051
And research facilities
necessary for this project

01:08:57.054 --> 01:08:59.794
Are not in the government,
nor can they be mobilized

01:08:59.795 --> 01:09:03.290
By the government in
peacetime without fatal delay.

01:09:03.292 --> 01:09:06.292
Only American industry
can do this job.

01:09:06.296 --> 01:09:09.225
The way frontiers
have been opened,

01:09:09.232 --> 01:09:11.232
And the way that they
should be opened,

01:09:11.234 --> 01:09:15.203
Is by an interaction of the
private and the public sector,

01:09:15.203 --> 01:09:17.804
Working for the good of all

01:09:17.805 --> 01:09:20.636
So that the government
is providing

01:09:20.642 --> 01:09:23.242
A Lewis and Clark function,

01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:26.813
A Magellan function,
a drake function,

01:09:26.814 --> 01:09:30.316
And then those
explorers are returning

01:09:30.317 --> 01:09:32.517
And telling us about
what's over the hill,

01:09:32.519 --> 01:09:35.087
What's across that ocean,

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:39.287
And then the private sector
moves into that realm

01:09:39.292 --> 01:09:43.761
And begins to turn what
it is that's been found

01:09:43.761 --> 01:09:46.261
Into new land, new wealth,

01:09:48.631 --> 01:09:51.501
And that's how you
open a frontier.

01:09:51.502 --> 01:09:53.536
You don't open a frontier

01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:57.667
By sending a few highly-
paid government employees

01:09:57.674 --> 01:10:03.711
Out there in a large and
expensive government vehicle

01:10:03.712 --> 01:10:09.112
And throwing most of it away
on the way there and back.

01:10:13.153 --> 01:10:14.853
Well, I know one thing.

01:10:14.854 --> 01:10:17.654
If they do build a space
station in my lifetime,

01:10:17.656 --> 01:10:19.416
Or send a ship to the moon,

01:10:19.424 --> 01:10:21.324
I'm gonna be ready to go.

01:10:21.325 --> 01:10:23.285
What courses are
you taking next year?

01:10:23.293 --> 01:10:25.493
Oh, my schedule
is already made out.

01:10:25.495 --> 01:10:28.325
In the ninth grade, you
have to take mathematics

01:10:28.331 --> 01:10:30.831
- And English and history...
- no science?

01:10:30.833 --> 01:10:32.433
Well, I had my choice of taking

01:10:32.434 --> 01:10:34.404
General science
this year or next,

01:10:34.405 --> 01:10:36.302
But I've put it off a year.

01:10:36.303 --> 01:10:38.203
Then you put your
trip off a year.

01:10:38.204 --> 01:10:41.372
Science is the
engine of prosperity.

01:10:41.373 --> 01:10:44.343
All the wealth we see around
us comes from science,

01:10:44.344 --> 01:10:48.478
But science is made by
scientists, mainly young people.

01:10:48.479 --> 01:10:51.247
Young people have
to be inspired.

01:10:51.248 --> 01:10:53.178
They have to look
into the sky and say,

01:10:53.183 --> 01:10:55.653
"wow, I wanna be part
of this great endeavor

01:10:55.654 --> 01:10:57.719
To explore the universe."

01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:00.920
The real spin-off that matters

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:03.524
Out of the Apollo program...

01:11:03.526 --> 01:11:08.556
Was a generation that saw that

01:11:08.563 --> 01:11:10.997
And in their mind, they mixed,

01:11:10.998 --> 01:11:15.928
"and people really doing something
cool out there in space,

01:11:15.936 --> 01:11:17.896
"and here's captain kirk

01:11:17.904 --> 01:11:20.604
And these kinds of
shows and movies,"

01:11:20.606 --> 01:11:22.006
"2001 space odyssey,"

01:11:22.007 --> 01:11:23.837
And if you put this all together

01:11:23.842 --> 01:11:27.382
In the mind of a child or a
teenager, what begins to happen

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:30.378
Is a synthesis that
says, "I wanna do that."

01:11:30.381 --> 01:11:31.981
"Somebody's done it.

01:11:31.982 --> 01:11:33.549
"I can do it.

01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:35.619
I'm gonna figure
out how to do it."

01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.918
The biggest spin-off
of the Apollo program

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.720
Was a generation who stayed
in school, who studied,

01:11:41.723 --> 01:11:44.323
And now, they wanna do that.

01:11:44.325 --> 01:11:46.385
They want to give
back to civilization

01:11:46.393 --> 01:11:48.631
In the way that they were
inspired to do as children.

01:11:48.632 --> 01:11:51.528
My son looked up at me
one night and asked me...

01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:54.030
Sorry, it still breaks me up...

01:11:55.532 --> 01:11:57.032
"daddy, is it really true

01:11:57.034 --> 01:12:00.369
That they used to fly to the
moon when you were a boy?"

01:12:00.370 --> 01:12:02.870
I was really disappointed that
we had not sent anyone to mars,

01:12:02.872 --> 01:12:05.542
That we had not
progressed beyond Apollo,

01:12:05.543 --> 01:12:08.309
And I kept waiting
for when we would,

01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:10.610
And it just didn't
happen, year after year.

01:12:10.612 --> 01:12:14.481
I submit that if we engage
in another bold vision

01:12:14.482 --> 01:12:15.951
Like we did in the '60s,

01:12:15.952 --> 01:12:17.620
This time not motivated by war,

01:12:17.621 --> 01:12:20.686
But by an understanding
of the impact

01:12:20.687 --> 01:12:22.617
Of that adventure
on our culture...

01:12:23.822 --> 01:12:25.522
Our culture...

01:12:25.524 --> 01:12:28.424
What people wanted to
be when they grew up.

01:12:28.426 --> 01:12:29.926
I am a child of Apollo.

01:12:31.027 --> 01:12:34.557
The greatest influences
I had growing up

01:12:34.564 --> 01:12:37.999
Were NASA and "star trek."

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.770
I didn't just believe we
were going into space.

01:12:40.771 --> 01:12:42.599
I expected it.

01:12:42.604 --> 01:12:45.404
It stimulates
an entire generation

01:12:45.406 --> 01:12:46.806
Of scientists and technologists.

01:12:46.807 --> 01:12:48.437
It's the 21st century.

01:12:48.441 --> 01:12:50.071
You need them if you care about

01:12:50.075 --> 01:12:52.505
The health of your
economy tomorrow.

01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:54.110
You need folks like
that around you.

01:12:54.111 --> 01:12:56.441
I went to the NASA
website to just see,

01:12:56.446 --> 01:12:57.476
"when are we going to mars?"

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.610
And I couldn't find that out.

01:13:01.717 --> 01:13:03.377
Then I thought, well,

01:13:03.385 --> 01:13:06.115
Perhaps this is a
question of... of will.

01:13:06.121 --> 01:13:09.621
Is there sufficient
will to do this?

01:13:09.624 --> 01:13:13.927
The reason I fight
so hard for this cause

01:13:13.928 --> 01:13:17.497
Is because I believe we are here

01:13:17.498 --> 01:13:19.998
To expand and grow

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.500
And carry the light
of life into space.

01:13:23.503 --> 01:13:26.571
If we don't embrace
space as a frontier,

01:13:26.572 --> 01:13:29.440
What are we as a species?

01:13:29.441 --> 01:13:31.041
We have the power to do it.

01:13:31.042 --> 01:13:32.742
We have the know-how to do it.

01:13:32.743 --> 01:13:34.643
We know what it can bring us...

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:40.114
Culturally, economically,
militaristically.

01:13:40.116 --> 01:13:44.616
To not do it is to simply
not have the foresight.

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:49.620
In these final hours
before Apollo 17,

01:13:49.623 --> 01:13:51.490
Some people are gloomy about

01:13:51.491 --> 01:13:53.560
The future of space exploration.

01:13:53.561 --> 01:13:56.129
Not among them is
Dr. Wernher Von Braun,

01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:58.498
The retired rocket
expert to develop

01:13:58.499 --> 01:14:00.697
The big Saturn launch vehicles

01:14:00.699 --> 01:14:03.429
Used to send men
on their way to the moon.

01:14:03.435 --> 01:14:05.595
I talked with Dr. Von
Braun earlier this evening.

01:14:05.603 --> 01:14:09.138
I think that all good
things have an ending.

01:14:09.139 --> 01:14:12.169
I consider Apollo a
little bit as it were

01:14:12.175 --> 01:14:16.975
As a sailing ship and dog
sled area for the south pole.

01:14:16.979 --> 01:14:19.109
Or next time we go
to the south pole,

01:14:19.114 --> 01:14:21.548
We'll go by turboprop airplane.

01:14:21.549 --> 01:14:24.449
We doubled the number
of science graduates

01:14:24.451 --> 01:14:26.721
In this country during
Apollo at every level:

01:14:26.722 --> 01:14:28.819
High school, college, PHD.

01:14:28.821 --> 01:14:30.190
What force was operating to make

01:14:30.191 --> 01:14:31.689
Everyone want to
become scientists?

01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:34.020
We were going to the moon.

01:14:34.025 --> 01:14:36.755
So, our motivation was
militaristically driven,

01:14:36.761 --> 01:14:38.891
But we benefited
economically from it

01:14:38.896 --> 01:14:41.196
Because scientists
and technologists

01:14:41.198 --> 01:14:44.028
Invent the economies
of tomorrow.

01:14:47.970 --> 01:14:51.109
We used to invent new
things with such frequency

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:53.867
That you didn't fix something
that was about to break.

01:14:53.876 --> 01:14:56.176
You put in something
completely new

01:14:56.178 --> 01:14:59.508
That took you to a new place.

01:14:59.514 --> 01:15:01.214
You didn't have to worry
about the old thing breaking,

01:15:01.215 --> 01:15:04.515
Because you just replaced
the entire structure

01:15:04.518 --> 01:15:06.478
With better materials,
lighter materials,

01:15:06.486 --> 01:15:09.646
More durable materials.

01:15:09.655 --> 01:15:13.885
These are the things that come
out of an innovation nation.

01:15:13.892 --> 01:15:15.692
You know how you get in
an innovation nation?

01:15:15.693 --> 01:15:18.031
You put a bold project
in front of them

01:15:18.032 --> 01:15:20.798
That inspires people to want
to innovate in the first place.

01:15:20.799 --> 01:15:24.227
And I know of no
greater force of nature

01:15:24.233 --> 01:15:27.473
Than what going
into space can do...

01:15:28.836 --> 01:15:30.766
For the next
generation of people

01:15:30.772 --> 01:15:34.841
Who are tasked with taking
us into the 21st century.

01:15:34.842 --> 01:15:38.642
I believe that we
can carry this battle

01:15:38.645 --> 01:15:42.205
And basically address
it, articulate it

01:15:42.215 --> 01:15:44.975
As an economic
challenge to the nation,

01:15:44.984 --> 01:15:46.924
A technological
challenge to the nation,

01:15:46.925 --> 01:15:49.887
A spiritual challenge
to the nation,

01:15:49.888 --> 01:15:54.858
That we have to
believe as a nation...

01:15:54.859 --> 01:15:57.259
We are capable of
doing difficult things

01:15:57.261 --> 01:15:59.228
And move forward and do it.

01:15:59.229 --> 01:16:02.829
We need to bring
America's character

01:16:02.832 --> 01:16:05.602
To bear on America's frontier.

01:16:06.567 --> 01:16:07.927
And if we do that...

01:16:10.037 --> 01:16:13.767
There is no limit to
what we can accomplish.

01:16:14.741 --> 01:16:17.577
We were given the Apollo program

01:16:17.578 --> 01:16:19.508
Because of a set of challenges

01:16:19.513 --> 01:16:22.548
That a very young
president faced.

01:16:22.549 --> 01:16:24.716
We were fortunate at that time

01:16:24.717 --> 01:16:26.577
We had the articulators.

01:16:26.585 --> 01:16:28.815
We had the Von
Brauns and the lows

01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:31.750
And the gurus who were
capable of going up

01:16:31.756 --> 01:16:34.016
And basically talking
to this president

01:16:34.024 --> 01:16:37.993
And talking to the us congress
and selling this program.

01:16:37.994 --> 01:16:42.998
We need the people who have
that fluency, that belief

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:46.568
And are willing to expend
themselves in that cost.

01:16:46.569 --> 01:16:47.899
During the Apollo era,

01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:49.872
You didn't need
government programs

01:16:49.873 --> 01:16:51.137
Trying to convince people

01:16:51.138 --> 01:16:52.538
That doing science
and engineering

01:16:52.539 --> 01:16:54.069
Was good for the country.

01:16:54.073 --> 01:16:56.107
It was self-evident.

01:16:56.108 --> 01:16:59.708
Maybe we need a department
of future thinkers...

01:17:01.211 --> 01:17:04.651
Who aren't thinking, "will I
get reelected this November?"

01:17:04.652 --> 01:17:08.548
Who aren't thinking,
"can we afford this now?

01:17:08.551 --> 01:17:10.921
"Are these other problems
I have to solve?" no.

01:17:10.922 --> 01:17:13.790
We need like a new
presidential cabinet position:

01:17:13.791 --> 01:17:15.919
The futurist.

01:17:15.924 --> 01:17:19.626
They can help set
priorities for how we invest

01:17:19.627 --> 01:17:22.557
Versus the return on
that investment later on.

01:17:24.296 --> 01:17:25.796
That's what we need.

01:17:28.633 --> 01:17:30.633
We don't have that...

01:17:30.636 --> 01:17:32.666
And I've been trying,
but I've been failing,

01:17:32.671 --> 01:17:34.701
So basically, I gave up.

01:17:34.706 --> 01:17:36.706
Just going back to my lab.

01:17:36.708 --> 01:17:39.638
I'm tired of screaming
into people's ears.

01:17:39.644 --> 01:17:40.844
What we got paid back for

01:17:40.845 --> 01:17:43.105
Were million of
scientists, engineers,

01:17:43.113 --> 01:17:45.913
Doctors, medical
researchers, inventors, okay?

01:17:45.915 --> 01:17:47.275
Who are the people who created

01:17:47.283 --> 01:17:49.052
The economic boom of the 1990s?

01:17:49.053 --> 01:17:51.120
These 40-year-old
techno billionaires

01:17:51.121 --> 01:17:52.319
Who built silicon valley.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.220
These are the 12-year-
old of the 1960s.

01:17:54.221 --> 01:17:59.021
Apollo worked because John
F. Kennedy said in 1961,

01:17:59.025 --> 01:18:02.655
"we are going to be on the
moon by the end of the decade,"

01:18:02.661 --> 01:18:05.699
And while administrations
changed in early 1969,

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.597
We were practically to the moon

01:18:07.598 --> 01:18:10.728
And they weren't about to
cancel that at that point.

01:18:10.734 --> 01:18:13.841
If instead, Kennedy had said,
"I think it'd be good idea

01:18:13.842 --> 01:18:16.267
To go to the moon and we
should do it by the year 2000,"

01:18:16.272 --> 01:18:18.872
We never would have
made it to the moon.

01:18:18.874 --> 01:18:20.774
It's not about
the rocket equation.

01:18:20.775 --> 01:18:22.875
It's not about physics.

01:18:22.877 --> 01:18:27.046
We solve those issues
every single day.

01:18:27.047 --> 01:18:29.847
We have built a cage
around our ideas.

01:18:29.849 --> 01:18:33.749
We have built a cage around our
future that says, "you cannot."

01:18:33.752 --> 01:18:36.322
We are telling the
generation that exists today

01:18:36.323 --> 01:18:38.989
That they're going
to have less...

01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:40.659
That they should
give up their dreams,

01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:44.227
That their job is to save a
planet that we've screwed up.

01:18:44.228 --> 01:18:47.728
What really matters
is that someday

01:18:47.731 --> 01:18:49.631
There's a kid
living on the moon,

01:18:49.632 --> 01:18:50.832
There's a kid living
in free space,

01:18:50.833 --> 01:18:52.400
There's a kid living on mars,

01:18:52.401 --> 01:18:53.901
Who looks back at
the earth and says,

01:18:53.902 --> 01:18:55.168
"that's where we came from,"

01:18:55.169 --> 01:18:56.669
Turns their head,
looks the other way,

01:18:56.670 --> 01:18:57.870
And says, "that's
what we're going."

01:18:57.871 --> 01:19:00.301
It will be a human endeavor.

01:19:00.306 --> 01:19:03.006
It will bring out the
best in humankind.

01:19:03.008 --> 01:19:05.776
Space exploration
has changed your life,

01:19:05.777 --> 01:19:08.337
And it's made your life better.

01:19:08.346 --> 01:19:11.846
The food you eat, your
communication systems,

01:19:11.849 --> 01:19:15.849
Your transportation systems
are all made better by space.

01:19:15.853 --> 01:19:19.322
But deeper and bigger
and more importantly,

01:19:19.323 --> 01:19:23.759
Your view of your
relationship to the cosmos,

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.260
Your place in space,

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.996
Is fundamentally
influenced by people

01:19:27.997 --> 01:19:30.427
Who have insisted
that we explore space,

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.300
That we go over the horizon,

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:35.001
That we look beyond
what we can see,

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:36.970
And that is all to the good

01:19:36.971 --> 01:19:39.871
And it is in everyone's
best interest to support it.

01:19:41.773 --> 01:19:44.976
We cannot allow
ourselves to settle

01:19:44.977 --> 01:19:48.377
For the condition and the
state that we are in today.

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:52.380
We have to become the foot
soldiers in the fight for space,

01:19:52.384 --> 01:19:54.784
And it has to apply
to every person

01:19:54.786 --> 01:19:57.986
Who lives, works,
and dreams of space,

01:19:57.989 --> 01:19:59.419
And it's time to do it now.

01:32:37.205 --> 01:32:39.305
- I got fired.
- -really?

01:32:39.308 --> 01:32:41.238
Yes, sir, out the door.

01:32:41.243 --> 01:32:42.543
"We're not gonna fly you again.
