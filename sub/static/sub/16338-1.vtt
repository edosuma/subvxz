03:26.640 --> 03:28.430
When did you notice the lump?

03:28.810 --> 03:30.390
Two months ago,

03:30.480 --> 03:33.270
but it hasn't grown since then,
it's the same.

03:38.150 --> 03:40.950
- You have another, deeper down.
- Another one?

03:42.320 --> 03:43.660
On the chest wall.

03:44.160 --> 03:47.040
Then I didn't check myself right.
I'm sorry.

03:47.540 --> 03:51.160
It's not easy.
Some nodules escape self-examination.

03:51.830 --> 03:53.000
They're a minority.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.250
So what you're touching
is in a minority?

03:57.500 --> 03:59.670
What percentage of women
get breast cancer?

04:00.470 --> 04:02.880
1 in 8 are at risk.

04:06.350 --> 04:10.180
Your face is telling me
that I should, isn't it?

04:10.850 --> 04:13.480
That I'm the weird side
of the statistics?

04:13.560 --> 04:14.940
The bad side?

04:15.690 --> 04:18.860
Why didn't you come two months ago
when you noticed the lump?

04:21.110 --> 04:22.780
Because as I said...

04:22.860 --> 04:25.160
it's small and it hasn't grown.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.620
I don't know.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.240
You can get dressed.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.130
I'm sending you to Radiography
for an X-Ray and a mammogram.

04:36.290 --> 04:39.050
I didn't come before because
I didn't want to be paranoid.

04:39.130 --> 04:43.300
The crisis and unemployment
are affecting my health.

04:44.220 --> 04:46.140
- You're unemployed?
- Yes.

04:46.890 --> 04:51.640
Well, I taught children
until last week.

04:51.730 --> 04:54.560
I won't know what it's like
to be unemployed till after summer.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.730
Can you imagine how lonely
I'm going to feel next year?

04:59.400 --> 05:00.900
I can imagine.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.570
- Have I got something bad?
- It doesn't have to be.

05:06.410 --> 05:08.490
That's why we have to find out
exactly what it is.

05:08.580 --> 05:10.040
- Sure.
- Here.

05:11.330 --> 05:12.830
At the end of the hallway.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.420
<i>It's early so hardly anyone
will be waiting.</i>

05:48.110 --> 05:50.490
- Doctor.
- Hello.

05:53.290 --> 05:55.040
Stage 3.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.460
- What have I got?
- Let's do an ultrasound.

06:06.510 --> 06:08.470
What can you see?

06:09.300 --> 06:12.470
- We have to make two punctures.
- Two?

06:12.560 --> 06:15.480
- The deeper one is the worst.
- Yes...

06:15.560 --> 06:17.310
...on the chest wall.

06:17.390 --> 06:19.480
It's something to worry about,
isn't it?

06:20.520 --> 06:21.770
I can see it on your faces.

06:21.860 --> 06:24.110
The lab will tell us
if there's cause for concern.

06:25.070 --> 06:27.950
- When do the lab results come out?
- In two days.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.570
So what does “stage 3” mean?

06:31.660 --> 06:33.160
I heard you.

06:44.300 --> 06:47.550
Is there a history
of breast cancer in your family?

06:47.630 --> 06:50.260
Yes. My mother died
of breast cancer.

06:50.340 --> 06:52.510
Then why didn't you come before?

06:52.600 --> 06:55.770
I barely remember her.
She died when I was 4.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.850
We're going to ask the lab
for an urgent biopsy.

06:59.940 --> 07:00.810
Yes.

07:01.350 --> 07:05.020
Today at 6,
can you be in my office?

07:05.110 --> 07:06.730
<i>I'll</i> be on duty.

07:06.820 --> 07:09.780
At 6 I had to go
to the hairdresser.

07:09.860 --> 07:11.320
<i>I'll</i> go earlier.

07:14.660 --> 07:16.870
Do I go to the hairdresser or not?

07:18.330 --> 07:19.750
Go.

07:20.830 --> 07:22.960
Could you prescribe
some tranquilizers for me?

07:23.500 --> 07:24.920
I've got some here.

07:35.220 --> 07:39.480
It'd be good if this afternoon
someone came with you.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.310
Are you married? A husband?

07:41.390 --> 07:42.770
I don't know.

07:42.850 --> 07:44.900
That's another problem I've had
for three months,

07:44.980 --> 07:46.480
unemployment and my husband.

07:51.910 --> 07:53.620
- One? Two?
- One.

07:53.700 --> 07:57.410
<i>I'm sorry, Magda,
I'm driving out of Madrid.</i>

07:57.790 --> 08:01.580
<i>I've decided to spend July
out on my own.</i>

08:02.040 --> 08:03.000
Alone?!

08:03.080 --> 08:07.340
<i>I need to think about us,
it's better for both of us</i>

08:07.420 --> 08:09.460
<i>to spend time without in-laws.</i>

08:09.920 --> 08:12.260
<i>A big kiss for you and Dani.</i>

08:13.260 --> 08:16.260
Great!
Some holidays without arguments.

08:20.480 --> 08:21.770
Come in!

08:24.730 --> 08:26.860
- My hair...
- You look very nice.

08:28.070 --> 08:30.070
Thanks. So?

08:31.280 --> 08:32.450
Well...

08:35.620 --> 08:38.740
The lab report says
that both nodules are carcinomas.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.670
I knew it.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.050
I thought about it
while I was brushing my hair,

08:53.130 --> 08:56.430
I'd be told I had cancer
and get a breast amputated, right?

08:57.140 --> 08:59.930
Well, the term “amputate”
usually refers to limbs...

09:00.010 --> 09:01.560
a leg, an arm...

09:01.640 --> 09:04.560
I'd rather lose a breast than a leg.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.570
I don't believe it.

09:12.570 --> 09:15.820
Will you take it all,
or leave me a little?

09:16.160 --> 09:18.870
It has to be a mastectomy,
a complete removal.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.830
But in time you can get
reconstructive surgery.

09:23.500 --> 09:24.500
And my nipple?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.080
You won't even leave me
my nipple as a keepsake?

09:28.170 --> 09:29.170
It's invaded.

09:31.590 --> 09:33.800
I don't want a silicon nipple.

09:36.630 --> 09:40.180
In this hospital we have
psychologists who could help you.

09:47.100 --> 09:50.360
Think that there's still time.
And that your prognosis is good.

09:51.270 --> 09:54.940
And that 70% of breast tumors
at this stage are cured.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.360
They're cured...

09:57.360 --> 09:59.370
Why move over
to the bright side of statistics

09:59.450 --> 10:01.280
when I've already stepped
on the dark side?

10:01.370 --> 10:03.790
Because you've got a better chance
of getting better.

10:03.870 --> 10:04.700
Two against one.

10:15.880 --> 10:16.880
That's my Dani!

10:19.010 --> 10:22.470
MAMA, I LOVE YOU

10:44.240 --> 10:45.410
Excuse me.

10:45.750 --> 10:48.500
Before the operation we have
to give you various chemotherapy cycles

10:48.580 --> 10:50.500
to reduce the size of the tumors.

10:51.170 --> 10:53.000
You have to be here
at 10 am tomorrow.

10:53.090 --> 10:56.760
- Tomorrow?
-10 tomorrow for the first dose.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.430
And what do I do with my son?

11:23.030 --> 11:24.530
Quiet, please!

11:27.370 --> 11:29.290
Good! Yes!

11:30.710 --> 11:32.750
That's how you raise your kids?

11:48.600 --> 11:51.520
When your son approaches
with the ball, he's a danger.

11:53.190 --> 11:56.730
And the way he's sweating.
He put on two shirts today.

11:57.610 --> 11:59.400
He's an extraordinary player.

12:00.070 --> 12:01.780
The kind that makes a difference.

12:01.860 --> 12:04.160
Thanks a lot! I'll tell him!

12:04.660 --> 12:07.910
I never liked soccer,
but since he's so keen...

12:09.870 --> 12:11.580
I work for Real Madrid.

12:13.830 --> 12:16.170
Are you a scout?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.420
I train the Juniors and I'm looking
for kids for next season.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.680
I see a future for your son.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.890
That's his dream,
to play in the pro league.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.270
It could come true.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.640
Really?!

12:34.100 --> 12:35.650
That's great!

12:36.020 --> 12:38.520
I needed some good news today!

12:41.490 --> 12:43.450
He really does play well.

13:37.420 --> 13:39.710
Excuse me.
Hello?

13:40.590 --> 13:42.630
Alejandra Yuste is my wife, yes.

13:43.260 --> 13:45.760
Yes, that's my daughter's name.
What is it?

13:50.890 --> 13:54.480
No, no, I can't, I'm working.
In half an hour...

13:59.310 --> 14:00.770
In which hospital?

14:06.110 --> 14:07.610
What happened?

14:27.130 --> 14:27.970
Sir!

14:28.470 --> 14:30.220
Virgen... Virgen de la Luz...

14:31.510 --> 14:34.100
Virgen de la Luz Hospital.

14:34.180 --> 14:35.810
My wife is alive.

14:39.810 --> 14:41.150
My wife is alive.

14:42.520 --> 14:43.650
Medics!

14:48.450 --> 14:50.620
I'm fine! I have to see my wife.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.990
- We have to take him to her hospital.
- I have to wait until the game's over.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.000
It's about to end. You go, <i>I'll</i> stay.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.580
Please tell my son,
the one who scored...

14:59.670 --> 15:01.080
- From the penalty?
- That's him!

15:01.170 --> 15:04.130
Tell him I've gone to the hospital
to help a man and he's to call me.

15:07.260 --> 15:09.130
Your wife will be alright.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.440
My daughter's been run over!

15:27.490 --> 15:29.950
My daughter... She's been killed!

15:30.450 --> 15:32.160
A bit faster, please.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.370
We'll be right there.

15:39.870 --> 15:44.210
Look, take these,
two tranquilizers will help.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.390
Let's sit down here.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.060
Take another pill.

16:12.660 --> 16:13.820
Mama?

16:15.200 --> 16:17.030
Honey, you didn't call me!

16:17.370 --> 16:19.080
A medic brought me.

16:22.830 --> 16:24.040
We lost.

16:24.130 --> 16:26.710
They scored two goals against us
after you left.

16:27.090 --> 16:28.380
Well...

16:31.300 --> 16:32.840
Who's that?

16:33.430 --> 16:35.090
He's a scout.

16:35.890 --> 16:37.510
- Really?
- Yes.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.600
And he liked you a lot.

16:41.020 --> 16:42.270
It doesn't look like it.

16:45.690 --> 16:47.860
I think I overdid the pills.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.400
- You gave him pills?
- Yes.

16:52.280 --> 16:55.360
- Why?
- I'll tell you later, sweetie.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.500
Mama, I'm tired. Let's go home.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.750
We're going to stay with him
a little longer, okay?

17:05.829 --> 17:08.790
Why, Mama? What's going on?
You're acting weird.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.380
Yes, sweetie. But I've got you.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.260
You're my beautiful boy.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.720
Did you like the way I played?

17:23.890 --> 17:27.020
You can't imagine how much
I loved watching you play.

17:27.770 --> 17:30.190
But Mama, I missed the penalty.
Don't exaggerate.

17:30.570 --> 17:32.780
But I loved that too.

17:42.660 --> 17:44.790
This man has lost his daughter

17:45.370 --> 17:47.370
and his wife is in a coma.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.760
I'm deeply sorry.

17:59.850 --> 18:02.430
I'm sending you all the strength
I've got right now.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.350
In case it helps you overcome this.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.770
Thank you so much.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.700
Where's Dad?

18:20.990 --> 18:23.080
He's in a town on the coast.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.750
He had to go
to teach a summer course.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.920
He didn't say goodbye.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.500
He'll call you later.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.130
<i>You know something?</i>

18:34.210 --> 18:36.840
Aunt Sofia's going to the reservoir
with your cousins tomorrow.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.970
- Would you like to go with them?
- Great!

18:39.050 --> 18:41.720
<i>I'll</i> get to see the Eurocup final
with my cousins.

18:42.260 --> 18:43.310
On Sunday.

18:44.100 --> 18:46.390
Watching soccer with you
and Dad is a bit boring.

18:46.850 --> 18:50.310
- I only like soccer when you play.
- Sure, you've got no idea.

18:53.320 --> 18:56.530
And you can stay there
as long as you want.

18:56.940 --> 19:00.200
Cool! My cousins can show me
how to water-ski!

19:01.950 --> 19:03.530
What are you going to do?

19:05.370 --> 19:07.000
I have to stay.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.830
Are you going to the hospital
to see that man?

19:08.910 --> 19:09.960
Yes.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.920
I want to see if they sign you
to the Real Madrid Juniors.

19:13.590 --> 19:15.340
If that's the reason, <i>I'll</i> let you.

19:22.510 --> 19:26.310
<i>We should help that man,
it's just terrible.</i>

19:27.680 --> 19:30.230
But do you know, this afternoon,
while he was watching you play,

19:30.310 --> 19:31.900
I saw him smile?

19:32.770 --> 19:33.520
I swear.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.450
- A lot of clothes, isn't it?
- Yes.

19:42.870 --> 19:45.080
<i>- Okay, honey, have a good time.
- You too.</i>

19:46.080 --> 19:47.700
- I love you.
- I love you too.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.250
Ciao.

20:12.020 --> 20:13.440
Call me.

20:13.810 --> 20:15.440
'Bye!

20:15.730 --> 20:17.110
<i>C, 1 .</i>

20:44.640 --> 20:47.640
You know this experience
will make you stronger, don't you?

20:48.930 --> 20:50.350
<i>I'll try.</i>

20:52.690 --> 20:55.350
I have to warn you about
the side effects of chemotherapy.

20:56.360 --> 20:59.940
The first symptom will be nausea.
Try not to vomit.

21:00.030 --> 21:02.440
<i>You'll have pain
in your muscles and joints.</i>

21:02.530 --> 21:05.950
<i>Your palms will go numb,
and the soles of your feet.</i>

21:06.490 --> 21:09.290
- You'll have diarrhea.
- A kick in the head, huh?

21:09.370 --> 21:12.330
They're very strong drugs
that destroy cells in mitosis,

21:12.410 --> 21:14.540
or cell division,
the cancerous ones.

21:15.210 --> 21:19.380
<i>But they also destroy healthy cells
that are fast-growing, like the epidermis.</i>

21:19.840 --> 21:22.720
Your skin and mucous membranes
will dry out a lot.

21:23.010 --> 21:24.800
You'll have to use a lot of cream.

21:24.880 --> 21:28.050
And you'll feel fatigue
from the destruction of red blood cells.

21:28.140 --> 21:30.810
- Sweating.
- Well, that's normal in summer.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.470
And your hair will fall out.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.400
But after the treatment
it'll grow back.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.150
When I'm cured.

21:41.860 --> 21:44.190
- That's how you have to see it.
- Of course.

21:44.900 --> 21:47.320
Cured. No boob, but cured.

21:47.410 --> 21:50.450
During the treatment
I want you to stay at home.

21:50.530 --> 21:52.790
Relax. Distract yourself.

21:52.870 --> 21:55.080
Read a lot, watch TV...

21:59.420 --> 22:02.250
- Is that your daughter?
- She will be, I suppose.

22:03.300 --> 22:04.470
You're going to adopt?

22:04.550 --> 22:07.430
My wife and I have been in
the adoption process for a year.

22:07.510 --> 22:10.680
If all goes well, this year
we'll go to Russia and get Natasha.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.350
Natasha...

22:12.430 --> 22:15.230
Wow, that'll be a fabulous trip!

22:15.680 --> 22:18.770
The two of you going so far
to get your daughter.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.230
How nice.

22:23.610 --> 22:24.740
Don't you think?

22:27.110 --> 22:30.120
4,000 kilometers.
In an orphanage in Siberia.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.580
What I'd give to go with my son
to Siberia and find him a sister.

23:34.850 --> 23:36.560
- Hello.
- How are you?

23:38.890 --> 23:40.190
How's your wife?

23:41.480 --> 23:42.480
Stable.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.820
- Thanks for coming.
- That's alright.

23:50.990 --> 23:52.530
Tomorrow we're burying...

23:54.030 --> 23:55.780
burying my daughter.

24:05.250 --> 24:06.960
I'm sorry.

24:21.730 --> 24:23.310
I'm sorry, brother.

24:32.150 --> 24:34.320
<i>The Spanish economy
is still plummeting.</i>

24:34.410 --> 24:37.370
<i>The unemployment rate
is now at 26%.</i>

24:37.450 --> 24:39.120
<i>The worst affected, young people,</i>

24:39.200 --> 24:43.710
<i>with 54% unemployed,
the highest in Europe.</i>

24:43.790 --> 24:45.670
<i>The risk premium is also soaring.</i>

24:45.750 --> 24:49.670
<i>International experts advise Spain
to request a European Union bailout</i>

24:49.760 --> 24:51.760
<i>to stave off economic collapse.</i>

25:36.300 --> 25:39.390
<i>Good pass to Cesc from mid-box,
in the back of the net!</i>

25:39.470 --> 25:41.770
<i>Goal!</i>

25:42.810 --> 25:45.940
<i>Goal by Silva!</i>

25:46.600 --> 25:48.730
<i>The Canary Islander comes from behind,</i>

25:48.810 --> 25:53.400
<i>heads it and Spain head over heels.</i>

25:53.490 --> 25:56.700
<i>In the Eurocup final,
a goal by Silva...</i>

25:56.780 --> 26:00.740
<i>Spain 1 - Italy O.</i>

26:00.830 --> 26:02.740
<i>What a goal by Spain!</i>

26:02.830 --> 26:05.960
<i>Playing on,
playing on- -- to the end.</i>

26:06.040 --> 26:09.420
<i>Xavi looks for support,
Jordi Alba overlaps like mad.</i>

26:09.500 --> 26:11.590
<i>Pass to Jordi Alba. Go, Jordi!</i>

26:11.670 --> 26:13.960
<i>Goal!</i>

26:19.180 --> 26:24.520
<i>Goal to Spain!</i>

26:25.520 --> 26:29.100
<i>Magic goal!
Jordi's got some balls!</i>

26:29.770 --> 26:32.770
<i>Spain 2 - Italy 0.</i>

26:32.860 --> 26:35.280
<i>There's Xavi, Torres...</i>

26:35.360 --> 26:36.950
- Goal!
- Goal!

26:44.120 --> 26:46.790
<i>There's Busquets, pass to Torres,
great position...</i>

26:46.870 --> 26:47.960
<i>Goal by Maia!</i>

26:48.040 --> 26:50.460
<i>Goal to Spain, and that's four!</i>

26:50.540 --> 26:54.670
<i>With you, the champs of Europe</i>

26:54.760 --> 26:55.880
<i>and the world!</i>

26:55.960 --> 26:58.010
Dani! I'm so glad, sweetie!

26:58.090 --> 27:00.720
<i>Spain's got the greatest
soccer players in the world.</i>

27:00.800 --> 27:02.390
<i>There's no soccer like ours.</i>

27:02.470 --> 27:04.100
That's true alright.

27:04.180 --> 27:07.680
<i>I'm going to be a soccer player.
And a great one, I'm sure.</i>

27:07.770 --> 27:10.650
Of course.
I'll see you scoring tons of goals.

27:10.730 --> 27:13.230
<i>Imagine if! became
a world champion, Mama?</i>

27:13.320 --> 27:14.730
You will be. Of course!

27:14.820 --> 27:16.820
<i>You'd better start
understanding soccer, eh?</i>

27:16.900 --> 27:18.400
Yes, I'm working on it.

27:19.070 --> 27:21.030
It was such fun!

27:21.110 --> 27:23.450
<i>I'm going, Mama,
there's a huge party here.</i>

27:23.530 --> 27:24.740
Go on.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.620
Don't be scared.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.620
Don't look.

28:57.590 --> 28:58.840
Hello.

29:04.930 --> 29:06.180
How is she?

29:07.100 --> 29:08.390
The same.

29:09.850 --> 29:11.350
Which in her case

29:12.020 --> 29:14.020
means worse.
Time's going against her.

29:18.360 --> 29:20.230
What's wrong? Are you sick?

29:21.360 --> 29:25.910
I'm on the strange
and bad side of statistics.

29:27.370 --> 29:28.700
I've got breast cancer.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.040
I'm being treated in another hospital,
a public one.

29:42.260 --> 29:45.510
But I've got a 70% chance
of being cured.

29:46.760 --> 29:47.970
Two against one.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.850
Then that bad 30%,

29:52.310 --> 29:53.600
we'll kick it hard...

29:57.060 --> 29:58.360
Goal!

29:59.610 --> 30:02.360
- Let the other team take it.
- That's right.

30:03.860 --> 30:05.280
And are you alone?

30:05.650 --> 30:08.490
In summer everybody's away.
Even my son.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.490
- You don't have a partner?
- Not anymore.

30:12.370 --> 30:14.000
Separated?

30:14.620 --> 30:18.460
Raúl teaches philosophy
at the university...

30:18.540 --> 30:21.340
and now he's spending summer
with a student, a blonde...

30:23.000 --> 30:24.420
Getting a suntan somewhere.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.470
You'll have time for the beach.

30:30.300 --> 30:31.760
With your 70%.

30:37.890 --> 30:39.060
Well...

30:40.440 --> 30:41.610
Good luck.

30:42.270 --> 30:43.440
Thanks.

30:55.700 --> 30:56.710
<i>Hi, Mama!</i>

30:56.790 --> 30:59.460
<i>- Hi, honey!
- I learnt how to mono-ski.</i>

30:59.540 --> 31:01.540
<i>You climbed a tree?</i>

31:01.630 --> 31:04.050
<i>Not “monkey”, silly,
skiing with one ski!</i>

31:04.130 --> 31:06.800
<i>- Oh, right! Of course.
- Dad hasn't called me.</i>

31:08.680 --> 31:10.590
Well, honey...

31:10.680 --> 31:12.930
it's okay, you know what he's like.

31:14.810 --> 31:16.180
<i>And the scout?</i>

31:16.980 --> 31:20.650
Fine. Time's on his side.

32:10.110 --> 32:11.610
Cheer up, Magda!

32:11.700 --> 32:13.660
We're on the last cycle.

32:13.740 --> 32:16.410
What if after this
all the bad side gets burnt off?

32:16.870 --> 32:18.870
Maybe you won't have
to take anything from me.

32:21.710 --> 32:23.330
<i>Get down now and eat something.</i>

32:41.770 --> 32:43.400
Those were her parents.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.020
They've gone to the canteen.

32:47.110 --> 32:48.820
They've been here for hours.

32:54.070 --> 32:56.240
<i>Good, good, good...</i>

32:57.410 --> 33:01.080
<i>but when your lips touch mine,
kissing me, provoking me...</i>

33:01.580 --> 33:03.250
She's getting worse.

33:06.420 --> 33:08.590
Gynecologist, are you singing?

33:09.340 --> 33:12.220
- He sings beautifully.
- Oh, really?

33:15.970 --> 33:17.430
Go on, please.

33:19.100 --> 33:21.520
- And how are you?
- Well, good.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.100
Waiting for the operation.

33:24.390 --> 33:26.190
Maybe they can completely cure me.

33:26.860 --> 33:28.060
I'm so glad.

33:29.070 --> 33:33.530
They're taking off my whole right breast.
They even take the nipple.

33:37.820 --> 33:40.700
- In which hospital?
- General Hospital.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.120
Do you want me to go with you
to the operation?

33:43.830 --> 33:45.710
- Tell me when...
- You can't.

33:45.790 --> 33:49.090
- Yes, I can.
- No. You've got enough here already.

33:52.130 --> 33:53.470
<i>Go on, please.</i>

33:53.550 --> 33:55.220
Come on, a little.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.600
<i>My brown-haired girl...</i>

34:07.310 --> 34:09.480
<i>if this isn't happiness...</i>

34:10.320 --> 34:13.900
<i>let God come down and see,
and if he doesn't believe...</i>

34:13.989 --> 34:15.949
<i>that this is heaven...</i>

34:16.449 --> 34:19.699
<i>and I'll do my damnedest,</i>

34:19.780 --> 34:23.659
<i>whatever you give me,
give it to me, give it good,</i>

34:23.750 --> 34:26.830
<i>a little like this,
a little for the one...</i>

34:32.250 --> 34:35.340
- What's wrong?
- She hasn't long. If you want to go in.

34:36.380 --> 34:38.800
- Her parents are in the canteen.
- I'll tell them.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.469
All the best.

34:49.940 --> 34:51.190
Arturo!

35:19.470 --> 35:20.390
What a sight I am.

35:56.920 --> 36:00.510
<i>You can't just put on anything.</i>

36:00.590 --> 36:02.590
<i>Fashion matters at the beach too,</i>

36:02.680 --> 36:06.930
<i>and there's a new trend
this summer...</i>

36:07.680 --> 36:10.190
<i>- Hi, Mama!
- Hi, son! How are you?</i>

36:10.270 --> 36:12.940
<i>Great.
Dad called me.</i>

36:13.440 --> 36:16.190
<i>- C)h, I'm so</i> glad.
<i>- Bul' he's not' a! the beach.</i>

36:16.270 --> 36:18.860
<i>He said the course he's teaching
is in the mountains.</i>

36:18.940 --> 36:20.570
That's better. Cooler.

36:20.650 --> 36:22.200
<i>He asked about you.</i>

36:22.280 --> 36:25.280
<i>I said you were going
with e scout' from Reel Madrid.</i>

36:26.620 --> 36:27.910
<i>Did I do right?</i>

36:27.990 --> 36:30.040
Yes, son, fine. Wonderful.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.880
<i>Thanks, Mama.
When are you coming for me?</i>

36:33.960 --> 36:36.000
What? Are you missing me?

36:36.090 --> 36:38.920
<i>It's the longest summer
I've had without seeing you.</i>

36:39.010 --> 36:41.010
I do miss you, sweetie.

36:41.090 --> 36:44.300
<i>I'm sick of the reservoir.
I want to go to the beach.</i>

36:44.390 --> 36:46.390
<i>Even if just you and I go.</i>

36:46.470 --> 36:47.890
Well! Hold on a little longer.

36:47.970 --> 36:51.980
Soon we'll go
to the prettiest beach in Spain.

36:52.060 --> 36:53.560
- Okay?
- <i>Okay!</i>

36:55.360 --> 36:56.270
<i>Raúl...</i>

36:57.440 --> 36:59.730
<i>since you Won'! answer,
I'm leaving you a message.</i>

37:00.990 --> 37:04.490
Tomorrow I'm going to the hospital
to have my right breast amputated...

37:04.570 --> 37:06.870
<i>Well, “amputate”
is not the right word, but...</i>

37:06.950 --> 37:08.790
<i>who cares?
What the hell do you care?</i>

37:09.160 --> 37:12.250
You're on vacations with a student,

37:12.330 --> 37:14.290
the one you call “my little blonde”.

37:14.370 --> 37:16.330
I saw her photo on WhatsApp.
Very cute.

37:17.040 --> 37:19.300
<i>All I ask is that
during this time,</i>

37:19.380 --> 37:21.760
<i>call your son more
in case he needs something,</i>

37:21.840 --> 37:23.930
<i>because I won't be able
to call much.</i>

37:24.010 --> 37:26.760
<i>And please don't tell him.
I don't want him to get scared.</i>

37:26.840 --> 37:28.550
<i>I'll tell him when I get out.</i>

37:28.640 --> 37:31.430
<i>Please respect me on this.
That's all.</i>

37:32.600 --> 37:33.940
<i>Goodbye, Raúl.</i>

37:34.020 --> 37:35.600
<i>Big kiss for the blonde.</i>

37:35.690 --> 37:38.440
By the way,
I don't have brown hair anymore.

37:39.190 --> 37:42.190
Now I'm bald. How about that?

37:49.030 --> 37:50.700
Is someone waiting for you?

37:50.790 --> 37:53.120
No. And I prefer it like this.
It gives me strength.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.790
Didn't you call a friend?

37:54.870 --> 37:56.500
Sure, and screw up their summer!

37:57.750 --> 38:01.210
And you? Have you packed
your bag for the trip to Siberia?

38:02.880 --> 38:04.510
- No.
- Why?

38:05.260 --> 38:06.470
There's time.

38:07.550 --> 38:09.140
I know someone who'd be so happy

38:09.220 --> 38:11.890
if he could be going
to get his daughter.

38:12.560 --> 38:13.980
Then he can go in my place.

38:15.890 --> 38:17.560
- What?
- Never mind.

38:17.650 --> 38:19.520
Come on, Julián, tell me.

38:20.110 --> 38:22.440
We've spent a lot trying.

38:23.070 --> 38:25.240
Now I'm not sure I want
a daughter with my wife.

38:28.450 --> 38:29.660
Well...

38:30.070 --> 38:31.700
Poor Natasha.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.410
Maybe no one will go and get her.

38:39.080 --> 38:41.170
You know what to do...

38:41.250 --> 38:44.260
if there's the slightest chance
of saving that nipple of mine.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.340
Okay---...

38:48.430 --> 38:51.800
But at least sing me something
before you operate on me.

38:53.430 --> 38:54.270
Go on.

38:55.520 --> 38:58.440
It relaxes me to know
I'm in the hands of an artist.

39:06.990 --> 39:10.620
<i>I walk the streets</i>

39:10.700 --> 39:13.120
<i>with your name</i>

39:13.620 --> 39:18.620
<i>enclosed in my fist.</i>

39:19.080 --> 39:21.710
<i>And I drag along</i>

39:21.790 --> 39:24.090
<i>a scarf</i>

39:24.170 --> 39:26.380
<i>full of memories</i>

39:26.460 --> 39:28.720
<i>towards oblivion,</i>

39:28.800 --> 39:30.340
<i>my love.</i>

39:30.430 --> 39:32.300
<i>If your pain</i>

39:32.390 --> 39:34.720
<i>were mine,</i>

39:34.810 --> 39:37.390
<i>and mine</i>

39:37.480 --> 39:40.770
<i>were yours,</i>

39:41.310 --> 39:46.070
<i>how beautiful love would be,</i>

39:46.820 --> 39:48.740
<i>love,</i>

39:48.820 --> 39:50.860
<i>to love.</i>

39:52.160 --> 39:57.580
<i>Not today or yesterday,</i>

39:57.660 --> 40:01.500
<i>but I will have...</i>

40:03.460 --> 40:07.170
<i>tomorrow...</i>

40:07.760 --> 40:11.470
<i>so I can fly.</i>

40:13.850 --> 40:15.350
Thank you!

40:17.680 --> 40:20.350
- It looks like mine!
- It doesn't look anything like it.

40:22.190 --> 40:24.230
How do you know? Have you seen it?

40:30.490 --> 40:32.200
You're right,
it looks nothing like it.

40:32.860 --> 40:33.990
Hi, Mama!

40:35.870 --> 40:37.290
Hi, son!

40:37.370 --> 40:39.790
They told me they took
one of your boobs away.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.370
Yes, but I've got another one.

40:57.470 --> 40:59.720
This way you have a souvenir of her.

41:09.730 --> 41:10.740
By the Way,

41:10.820 --> 41:12.490
Dad found out where you were,

41:12.570 --> 41:16.280
picked me up at the lake
and brought me here with him.

41:23.370 --> 41:24.830
Go outside a moment.

41:40.180 --> 41:42.270
Dani! Go find him, hurry!

41:45.230 --> 41:48.690
- What do I say?
- That I don't need his gift, I only want him.

41:48.770 --> 41:49.940
Okay!

41:56.360 --> 41:59.580
Magda, I'm staying with you,
I've decided.

41:59.990 --> 42:02.250
- I'm going to take care of you.
- No, Raúl.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.370
No way. Look...

42:05.460 --> 42:07.630
I'm going with Dani
for what's left of summer...

42:08.080 --> 42:09.290
and winter too.

42:09.380 --> 42:11.210
Make up something so he doesn't worry.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.300
Don't push me away, please.

42:13.970 --> 42:17.390
And get out of my room for good.

42:28.980 --> 42:29.810
Hi, Mama.

42:30.940 --> 42:33.230
- Hi, honey.
- Do you know who's here?

42:33.990 --> 42:35.900
- Who?
- The scout.

42:43.660 --> 42:46.210
Arturo, this is great.

42:47.250 --> 42:49.000
I just had a dream about you.

42:51.500 --> 42:52.670
How are you doing?

42:53.250 --> 42:56.420
A little groggy. Fine. And you?

43:02.180 --> 43:03.680
My wife died last week.

43:07.480 --> 43:09.060
I'm so sorry.

43:22.030 --> 43:23.530
Stay here.

43:47.560 --> 43:49.640
The operation was a success.

43:49.730 --> 43:51.480
Congratulations!

43:51.560 --> 43:53.480
You put me on
the good side of statistics?

43:53.560 --> 43:55.070
You're free of the disease.

43:55.860 --> 43:57.280
I'm free?

44:01.030 --> 44:02.820
When I told you about my friend,

44:02.910 --> 44:05.450
the one who'd go anywhere
for his daughter... that's him.

44:05.530 --> 44:06.910
His name's Arturo.

44:08.580 --> 44:09.750
Hello.

44:13.290 --> 44:15.420
- I'm discharging you tomorrow.
- That's great.

44:26.970 --> 44:28.640
What do you want to do tomorrow?

44:30.350 --> 44:32.440
- Me?
- You.

44:34.230 --> 44:35.900
I'll take you wherever you like.

44:36.650 --> 44:40.440
Well... I promised my son
I'd take him to the beach.

44:40.530 --> 44:42.280
With your 70%.

44:43.950 --> 44:46.280
Are you sure you want to go
to the beach?

44:47.080 --> 44:48.950
To get rid of any complexes,
from the first day.

44:49.040 --> 44:50.620
But you can't sunbathe.

44:52.500 --> 44:55.380
Then we'll buy a beach umbrella
for the three of us.

45:22.490 --> 45:23.780
<i>Let' s gm!</i>

45:31.750 --> 45:33.580
- Hi, Mama!
- Hi.

45:33.660 --> 45:36.210
- We've got a surprise for you.
- Oh, yes?

45:36.290 --> 45:37.540
What?

45:48.260 --> 45:49.510
It's real hair.

45:52.390 --> 45:54.310
It looks like mine.

45:55.060 --> 45:56.190
Wait, wait.

46:22.340 --> 46:24.380
It already smells like the sea!

46:26.680 --> 46:29.260
You can't miss the sea
in summer, right?

46:29.350 --> 46:30.890
Sure, or it wouldn't be summer!

46:39.520 --> 46:40.900
Thanks, Arturo.

47:28.950 --> 47:31.450
You set yourself up here.
<i>I'll</i> sleep on the sofa.

47:32.280 --> 47:33.780
Oh, sure!

47:34.450 --> 47:36.620
We came to be together, didn't we?

47:37.830 --> 47:39.460
To keep each other company.

47:40.120 --> 47:43.460
Yes. But you're the one
who needs company the most.

47:44.880 --> 47:48.840
We sleep in the same bed,
in T-shirt and underwear.

47:48.920 --> 47:50.800
Without touching, nothing.

47:51.930 --> 47:54.140
But we're going to look
into each other's eyes,

47:54.600 --> 47:55.970
up close...

48:25.960 --> 48:29.420
This season Madrid's team
is way better than Barga's, right?

48:29.510 --> 48:31.630
Yes. It's our turn to win the League.

48:33.050 --> 48:34.550
And the Champions.

49:24.310 --> 49:26.190
Who's coming to the water with me?

49:27.190 --> 49:28.230
Let's go.

49:36.410 --> 49:40.450
Dani got a shock when he saw
my prosthetic breast.

49:42.200 --> 49:43.710
It's only natural.

49:45.330 --> 49:47.330
He'll soon see it as normal.

49:48.290 --> 49:49.880
Arturo!

50:07.860 --> 50:09.360
What position did you play?

50:11.440 --> 50:13.860
I rotated a little
in the first years, but...

50:13.940 --> 50:15.530
left back...

50:15.610 --> 50:18.820
and then I started playing midfield,

50:18.910 --> 50:20.700
distributing the ball,
which is my thing.

50:21.450 --> 50:23.200
Why did you stop so young?

50:23.750 --> 50:25.790
<i>I'll</i> tell you later, Dani.
Let's talk to your mother.

50:28.540 --> 50:30.880
It's alright, keep talking.

50:33.460 --> 50:35.220
C'mon, honey, I'll put you to bed.

50:38.180 --> 50:41.100
It's just...
I wanted to talk to Arturo.

50:44.310 --> 50:45.520
Arturo.

50:45.980 --> 50:47.900
He wants you to put him to bed.

50:48.980 --> 50:50.270
Okay.

50:56.150 --> 50:57.530
Arturo,

50:57.610 --> 50:59.990
you still haven't told me
why you left the Madrid squad.

51:00.820 --> 51:03.830
Do you really think
you can leave Madrid just like that?

51:03.910 --> 51:05.660
No. Madrid leaves you.

51:06.330 --> 51:07.710
<i>I got a bad injury.</i>

51:07.790 --> 51:10.500
<i>- How old were you?
-22.</i>

51:11.040 --> 51:12.460
<i>So young--</i>

51:12.750 --> 51:14.510
<i>How did you get hurt?</i>

51:15.550 --> 51:18.340
<i>I went in hard to finish off a goal,</i>

51:18.430 --> 51:21.760
<i>and snapped a ligament in my knee.</i>

51:21.850 --> 51:25.100
<i>And you could never
play soccer again?</i>

51:25.180 --> 51:27.810
<i>No. Not as a professional.</i>

51:28.690 --> 51:32.520
<i>- That's why you became a scout?
- Yeah, my sight was still good.</i>

51:33.860 --> 51:35.110
Arturo...

51:35.190 --> 51:38.360
you don't need to wear the T-shirt,
I've seen you in swimming trunks.

51:58.800 --> 52:01.140
- Feel like a dip up to your knees?
- Yes.

52:01.220 --> 52:02.800
It's so hot...

52:09.180 --> 52:11.150
Dani, are you coming in?

52:11.230 --> 52:12.190
Not now.

53:27.050 --> 53:28.260
Yes, hello?

53:28.720 --> 53:32.230
<i>Magda, I'm Julián,
your gynecologist.</i>

53:32.310 --> 53:33.850
Julián!

53:33.940 --> 53:35.980
Wow, what a surprise!

53:36.480 --> 53:38.230
How are you? Happy New Year!

53:38.320 --> 53:39.730
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

53:39.820 --> 53:41.570
<i>How was your Christmas?</i>

53:41.650 --> 53:45.570
Great, celebrating being together,

53:45.660 --> 53:47.780
being a new family.

53:48.990 --> 53:52.290
Arturo's the best thing
to happen to us.

53:52.370 --> 53:55.170
He's acting like
a real dad for Dani.

53:55.710 --> 53:59.670
<i>- And how are you?
- I'm</i> great. <i>I'm</i> doing <i>the best</i> here.

54:00.500 --> 54:02.340
They've got more to get over.

54:02.420 --> 54:04.340
I help them as best I can.

54:05.050 --> 54:07.220
But I'm fine.
The days get a bit long.

54:07.300 --> 54:09.010
<i>I miss the students,</i>

54:09.680 --> 54:12.180
<i>but I'm in this house, which I like,</i>

54:12.270 --> 54:15.020
<i>and it' helps me to start'
a new life.</i>

54:16.060 --> 54:18.980
-It's Dani that worries me a little.
<i>- Why?</i>

54:20.400 --> 54:23.610
Because he's still affected
by me, poor boy.

54:23.690 --> 54:25.150
<i>What do you mean, affected?</i>

54:25.240 --> 54:27.030
He avoids eye contact.

54:27.860 --> 54:30.780
He can only look at me
for a few seconds.

54:31.870 --> 54:33.870
We're thinking of taking him
to a psychologist.

54:34.960 --> 54:37.620
Raúl, his father, is no help at all.

54:37.710 --> 54:40.840
He has seen him once
since the school year started.

54:40.920 --> 54:43.380
<i>They said you didn't go
for your check-up.</i>

54:43.460 --> 54:45.010
Yes, of course I went,

54:45.670 --> 54:49.300
but they said there was a months-long
waiting list for a mammogram.

54:49.390 --> 54:51.720
<i>You should have come to my office.</i>

54:51.810 --> 54:55.060
Yeah, right. Why would I barge
in front of everyone else?

54:55.430 --> 54:57.350
<i>Because your gynecologist says so.</i>

54:57.770 --> 55:01.980
<i>Come tomorrow at 9:00.
That way I won't be worried.</i>

55:05.570 --> 55:06.740
Come in.

55:08.490 --> 55:09.910
Hello.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.410
- Alright then...
- Look.

55:19.670 --> 55:21.130
Don't I look terrific?

55:21.840 --> 55:23.340
You're an artist, Julián.

55:23.420 --> 55:25.920
-It's healed over well.
- Yes, and it doesn't hurt.

55:26.010 --> 55:29.010
I've got almost total mobility
in my right arm.

55:29.090 --> 55:31.760
And I examine this one
every day and thoroughly.

55:31.850 --> 55:34.180
Since I only have one left,
I can give it full attention.

55:34.260 --> 55:36.020
And Arturo helps me.

55:36.100 --> 55:39.190
I've got nothing,
not the slightest lump.

55:39.270 --> 55:40.560
Alright, let's take a look.

55:44.270 --> 55:46.320
But Arturo can't get it up.

55:47.940 --> 55:49.780
We've never made love, not once.

55:50.160 --> 55:53.950
He caresses me, kisses me, he's nice
and all that, but it stays the same.

55:54.030 --> 55:57.410
So in May I'm getting an operation
to get two monster boobs,

55:57.500 --> 55:59.870
hit the beach, sunbathe
and turn him on!

56:07.460 --> 56:09.590
- And your daughter?
- She's not my daughter.

56:09.970 --> 56:12.550
That means she's still in Siberia.

56:12.640 --> 56:15.350
It must be so cold there now!
Poor thing!

56:22.650 --> 56:24.980
Julián, don't look like that,
I know that face.

56:32.910 --> 56:34.990
You're scaring me.
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

57:30.050 --> 57:31.130
Hello!

57:32.800 --> 57:35.890
Your son was great at training today,
he's amazing.

57:36.510 --> 57:39.310
- Great!
- She doesn't care about soccer.

57:39.390 --> 57:40.640
No, Dani, that's not true.

57:40.720 --> 57:43.560
- You have to respect her tastes.
- She broke her promise.

57:44.440 --> 57:48.060
- What promise?
- You were going to try to understand soccer.

57:48.900 --> 57:51.530
- Oh, did I promise that?
- Yes.

57:51.610 --> 57:53.490
Then I'm sorry.
Give me a kiss.

57:56.450 --> 57:57.660
Dani!

57:58.070 --> 57:59.870
You don't kiss a mother like that.

58:45.120 --> 58:47.210
What is it? You have to take
the other one off too?

59:00.350 --> 59:02.470
That girl's cold.

59:05.930 --> 59:07.440
It's incurable now.

59:26.620 --> 59:28.370
How long do I have left?

59:43.720 --> 59:46.520
Six months, at most.

59:48.270 --> 59:50.980
Six months, just when
my unemployment checks run out.

59:53.230 --> 59:55.320
So I won't make it to summer?

59:55.690 --> 59:59.320
I can't even celebrate
my first anniversary with Arturo?

59:59.950 --> 01:00:01.700
Magda, it's spread.

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:05.040
You couldn't have found it
with self-examination.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:09.210
It's invaded the chest wall
and you have metastasis of the lung.

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:11.880
It's an advanced 4th stage.

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:15.880
That really is on
the fucking far side of statistics!

01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:19.170
I just don't get it.

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:23.300
After the chemo cycles,
after the mastectomy,

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:25.180
it's a very rare relapse.

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:27.560
- Can't anything be done?
- And so malignant.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.560
I'm sure something can be done.

01:00:33.810 --> 01:00:36.650
I can tell you about
a palliative treatment with chemotherapy

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:38.490
to improve your quality of life.

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:40.030
Quality of life!

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:44.740
Vomiting all day,
feeling like shit, bald again...

01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:49.330
If you want to wait until I'm off work,
I can go home with you and tell Arturo.

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:51.920
Arturo...

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:58.000
And who's going to tell my son?

01:00:58.090 --> 01:01:00.590
Who's going to tell my son?

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.840
Dani can't be an orphan!

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:06.220
Not Dani! Not Dani!

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.100
Not Dani!

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.060
Dani can't be alone!

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.400
Dani doesn't have to find out yet.

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:26.240
Do you know the greatest love
in the world,

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.450
and which nothing can surpass?

01:01:29.410 --> 01:01:30.870
I think so.

01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:32.620
But you tell me.

01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:35.540
That of a mother for her son

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.880
and that the son
can return to his mother.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.460
Yes. Just what I thought.

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:45.640
So? What's your problem with her?

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.720
Nothing. I don't think she wants me
to be a soccer player when I grow up.

01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:52.850
No,Dani.
Your mother's very proud of you.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.650
But we can't force her
to like soccer.

01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:58.610
But then, she won't be able
to understand me.

01:01:58.690 --> 01:02:01.440
Or my problems,
or what's wrong with me, nothing.

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:04.150
Think about what she went through
in the summer,

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:06.610
and how she protected you
from suffering.

01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:08.660
And now she's recovered.

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:11.910
When are you giving Mama
her new boob?

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.000
Before the summer,
but don't say anything to her, eh?

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.130
Come on, now let's say
the Lord's Prayer.

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:25.010
“Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...”

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:32.520
I'm glad you haven't
taken away her photo.

01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:38.350
It's not there.

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:40.480
I took it away some time ago.

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:28.910
<i>I'll</i> tell Arturo.
I'd rather he found out from me.

01:03:58.270 --> 01:03:59.480
White.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.690
Like your team.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.160
Don't cry, honey.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.910
No, no, no!
We'll do this without tears.

01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:00.620
We'll do this without tears.
Just help me to be strong.

01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:02.500
My love.

01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:38.010
- Aren't you working today?
- No, I'm staying home today.

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:41.720
That's not good.

01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:44.730
I hope you don't stop working
because of me.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.100
I want to spend the day with you.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.730
I spoke to Julián before.

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.740
He wants us to go see him to...

01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:58.240
...to tell us what it'll be like.

01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:00.240
The path.

01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:02.450
No.

01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:06.250
I'd rather not know.

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:11.130
He has experience,
he could help us.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.470
- He never went.
- To where?

01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:19.260
Siberia.

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:31.480
He knows some specialist psychologists...

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.150
I don't want a psychologist
poking around my head.

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:36.990
I only want you.

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.950
I want you to make love to me
right here.

01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:17.319
I swear to God, if I could,
I'd give my life for you.

01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:41.340
Arturo...

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:45.050
You're inside me.

01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:47.470
Yes, my love!

01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:54.850
Arturo...

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.480
I have to confess something crazy.

01:11:06.150 --> 01:11:07.280
I'm pregnant.

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.710
Well...

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.210
Relax,
I'll settle for lasting 9 months.

01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:27.050
8, 7...

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:29.720
<i>I'll</i> make it to August, for sure.

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:32.560
Could she?

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:39.310
Yes.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.560
Whatever you want.

01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:47.030
I want a girl.

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.080
And one more thing...

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.370
I want...

01:11:58.370 --> 01:12:00.580
to live to see her little face.

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:04.380
It's not much to ask, is it?

01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:08.420
Then <i>I'll</i> say goodbye
to this world.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.390
Go out in style.

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:19.640
So, you're not going
to congratulate me?

01:13:13.570 --> 01:13:14.700
Mama...

01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:16.910
Yes, Dani.

01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:18.740
Dad's girlfriend looks a lot like you.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.910
He's changed already?
So quickly?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.880
I don't know,
she's the only one I've met.

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:26.790
What color's her hair?

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.430
Black.

01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:34.090
Just like yours.

01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.510
- How old is she?
- Around 20 or 30.

01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:40.850
And she's got these boobs...!

01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:10.630
One of your wishes came true.

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:12.210
What?

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.760
It's a girl.

01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:17.300
It's a girl!

01:14:22.730 --> 01:14:23.810
It's a girl.

01:14:25.730 --> 01:14:28.190
It's my gift. For Dani. For you.

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:03.830
What have you got there?

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.170
<i>I'll</i> tell you if you look me
in the eye.

01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:13.920
One, two...

01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:20.510
A ball!

01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:25.850
Three, four, five.

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:30.850
Honey, no!

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:33.560
Remember I promised
I'd get you a little sister?

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.320
She's right here.

01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:43.700
You ordered me a little sister?!

01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:52.920
- When will she be born?
- The end of summer.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.180
Dani, unless you get better
at Language and Math,

01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:11.060
you're going to fail.

01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.150
I can't get my head around them.

01:17:13.230 --> 01:17:16.650
As of tomorrow,
every night after training

01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:18.230
it's dinner and homework with Mama.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.820
Even if you're tired.

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:21.570
Okay.

01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:25.740
Mama.

01:17:33.210 --> 01:17:34.750
How did she get there?

01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:37.170
It's very easy.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.880
Do you know where Siberia is?

01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:44.180
I've got to teach you
Geography too, huh?

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:47.100
-It's in Russia.
- Oh, yes.

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:53.520
A mother once went
to Siberia alone

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.190
and found a little girl who was lost.

01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:59.360
She was called Natasha,
and she had no parents.

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:01.110
- Natasha...
- Do you like that?

01:18:02.650 --> 01:18:05.570
Natasha was terribly cold...

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:07.780
a freezing, freezing wind blew...

01:18:09.450 --> 01:18:11.620
So Mama picked up the girl,

01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:14.790
put her in her tummy
and brought her home.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.770
Look! Look! Look!

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.860
It's incredible.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.820
She does it so well.

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.990
Without even touching your heart.

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:54.080
Every night it's the same,
while I'm dreaming.

01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:57.830
Of course.
Now I understand why you're improving.

01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:00.920
- Of course.
- You'll get on very well.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.140
Hi, Natasha.

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:51.800
I'm your mother, Magda.

01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:53.810
It comes from Magdalena.

01:19:53.890 --> 01:19:57.100
I hope that now you're alive
and watching this video.

01:19:57.180 --> 01:20:00.100
I... I don't know,
they say I won't be around.

01:20:00.190 --> 01:20:02.230
Medical science says so.

01:20:03.690 --> 01:20:05.150
Oh, my girl...

01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:09.360
I want you to know
that thinking about you,

01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:12.240
thinking that
you're taking shape inside me,

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.580
is helping me so much.

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.410
Mama!

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:19.410
When the crisis is over
will you be a teacher again?

01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:24.170
Right now I'm teaching
my only student.

01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:26.300
Which is better,
'cause I love him the most.

01:20:28.010 --> 01:20:31.720
I'm on the home stretch,
there's no going back for me,

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.760
and I can't make
any detours or stops.

01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:37.560
You're looking at me from the future,
and I'm talking to you from here,

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:41.060
but we're moving together,
straight ahead, both of us,

01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:43.730
you with your beginning,
me with my end.

01:20:43.810 --> 01:20:45.110
Together.

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:47.610
Look, you're right here.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:55.280
Arturo said he feels
that God is protecting him.

01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:59.290
- That's great.
- Doesn't he protect you?

01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:02.960
I don't know.

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:06.500
Arturo also says that God helps
to know what's good and bad.

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.090
He thinks that when you die,
God judges you

01:21:09.170 --> 01:21:12.470
and if you followed his advice,
he sends you to Paradise forever.

01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:16.220
My wish is for you
to be born healthy.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.970
And if I could see
your little face as well, then...

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:23.980
I have another wish, I can't help it.

01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:27.900
That as you grow inside me,

01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:29.570
you cure this disease.

01:21:30.490 --> 01:21:34.110
I'd be so grateful to you,
I think I'd go crazy with joy.

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:36.120
Can you imagine?

01:21:36.490 --> 01:21:39.160
Feeding you with my left boob,

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.250
raising you, watching you grow up...

01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:43.330
tolerating your adolescence...

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:44.920
going to your wedding.

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:48.840
Making me a grandma!
And you watching me die.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:54.470
I know I can't ask you
for all of this.

01:21:54.970 --> 01:21:56.260
<i>I think...</i>

01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:59.010
it's time you found out
what your Mama thinks of God.

01:22:04.190 --> 01:22:06.770
In the beginning of time,

01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:09.070
Man was terribly cold

01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:11.190
and created gods
in his imagination.

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.950
- Do you know why?
- To get warm?

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.110
Yes, and for protection.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.740
And to defend himself
from the fear of death.

01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:21.870
- The fear of vanishing.
- So, do you believe in God?

01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:25.580
Since Man has believed in gods,
he's wondered the same thing:

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:29.290
When the body dies,
does the soul die too?

01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.130
No.

01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:32.130
Right now you and I are alive.

01:22:32.210 --> 01:22:34.380
The same as Natasha,
but she isn't born yet.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.640
And we'd like to think
we'll meet in another life.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.140
- After death.
- Sure.

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:43.640
But after thousands of years
believing in gods,

01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.900
Man has no proof
that the soul is immortal.

01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:50.400
<i>What I want to say is that...</i>

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.690
when I found out I might be leaving,

01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.400
my worst fear was Dani.

01:22:55.490 --> 01:23:00.030
What would happen to him,
the one I love most in the world.

01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:05.000
Don't be jealous.
Though it doesn't matter if you are jealous.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.750
It's only natural
among brothers and sisters.

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:10.090
I bet you're laughing, it's so silly!

01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:13.670
But...

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.470
if you don't believe in Heaven,
what do you believe in?

01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:18.930
What do I believe in? In life.

01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:21.260
It's the only thing
we know we've got.

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:24.640
In enjoying it without sacrificing
for the hereafter.

01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:26.440
Though maybe it exists.

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:29.600
We have to be as happy as we can.

01:23:29.690 --> 01:23:31.190
First with ourselves,

01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:34.610
and then by encouraging
those around us.

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:38.360
So, honey, even if I go
you'll have your brother Dani

01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:42.240
and your dad, Arturo,
the best dad you both could have.

01:23:42.330 --> 01:23:44.370
And they'll love you to bits.

01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:47.040
What do you do to live happy?

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:50.830
Try to get close to the things
that give us pleasure

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.050
and stay away from the things
that give us pain.

01:23:53.130 --> 01:23:55.210
- But in good measure.
- What measure?

01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:57.880
Don't hurt or be bad to anyone.

01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:00.090
Or to ourselves.

01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:02.470
I understand you now.

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:05.560
You're a good teacher.

01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.350
But don't just listen to me.

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:10.230
Listen to everyone.

01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:12.730
To Arturo, your father, Julián...

01:24:12.810 --> 01:24:14.650
to Natasha
when she starts to ask questions.

01:24:14.730 --> 01:24:16.570
Listen, as best you can,

01:24:16.650 --> 01:24:18.400
and come to your own conclusions.

01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:21.320
Mama, you're a great teacher.

01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:23.830
Thanks,honey.

01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:27.830
Thanks for telling me that.

01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:32.460
Well, my girl,
I hope you don't forget me.

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:36.250
If at any time
you want to see your mama

01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:38.760
in body and soul,
then put on this video.

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:43.010
I love you, Natasha!
That's why we stay alive.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.530
Would you like to baptize Natasha?

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.950
I'd understand.

01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:05.410
I want to ask you something, honey.

01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:07.620
Whatever you want.

01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:18.760
<i>Call Raúl, Danfs father.</i>

01:25:20.050 --> 01:25:21.840
<i>Ask him to come see us.</i>

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.850
<i>Tell him about my disease,</i>

01:25:24.930 --> 01:25:26.510
<i>then I'll speak to both of you.</i>

01:25:33.230 --> 01:25:34.520
Thank you.

01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:09.220
Hello, Raúl.

01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:15.100
This is Dani's home.

01:26:17.610 --> 01:26:20.480
I want him to keep living here,

01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:22.440
with Arturo

01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:25.070
and his little sister, Natasha.

01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:30.450
You can still see him under
the usual divorced father system.

01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:33.370
My wish is that you two agree

01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:37.380
to take turns,
vacations, weekends

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:39.420
and, of course, education.

01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:44.050
A little philosophy wouldn't hurt
our soccer player.

01:26:47.010 --> 01:26:48.640
<i>I'll</i> comply with your wish, Magda.

01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:50.760
Don't you worry.

01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:01.860
But first I want
to ask you something, Magda.

01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:03.990
Forgive me.

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:06.780
Forgive me.

01:27:07.530 --> 01:27:08.870
Forgive me.

01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:11.660
Of course I forgive you.

01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:15.160
Of course.

01:27:41.770 --> 01:27:43.610
And I want you to know...

01:27:44.730 --> 01:27:49.160
that in those first years
when I was your Aphrodite,

01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:52.700
you made me very happy. Very.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:54.950
Thank you.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.970
The whistle's about to blow!
Come on!

01:28:15.810 --> 01:28:17.680
C'mon, one goal
and we're the champions.

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.190
Go, Dani!

01:28:24.570 --> 01:28:26.820
Dani, go! Go!

01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:29.820
Goal!

01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:49.920
MAMA, ARTURO, NATASHA
I LOVE YOU

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:05.520
Mama!

01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:08.650
I passed everything!

01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:09.530
What?

01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:12.160
I passed everything.
Math and Language too.

01:29:12.490 --> 01:29:13.990
That's great!

01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:17.330
Honey, that makes me so happy.

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:22.210
Next year I want you to get
good grades from the start.

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:24.630
With you as my teacher,
it's a breeze.

01:29:25.170 --> 01:29:26.460
Honey!

01:29:28.710 --> 01:29:31.930
- Hello!
- What are you doing here? Hey!

01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:33.470
I came to see you.

01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:39.680
Look at this.

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:56.830
So you stopped being a singer
so you could cure mothers.

01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:03.040
You're doing great with me.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.920
You should come to my office
to get more tests.

01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:14.430
No!

01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:16.340
The best test is your face.

01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:19.310
It says you don't know how,
but this is going strong.

01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:22.480
I have an extraordinary nature.

01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:24.640
Yes. That's true.

01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:27.770
At this rate we're going
to break a lot of molds.

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:33.490
And has your wife forgiven you
for not going to Siberia?

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.700
We're separating.

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:47.960
Look.

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:50.380
The two men of the house
watching movies.

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:53.510
Which one is it?

01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:55.930
“El Cid”, in the conquest of Valencia.

01:30:56.970 --> 01:31:01.390
He's dead, but tied to a horse
so the soldiers don't find out.

01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:14.570
I want Arturo
to take me to the beach.

01:31:14.650 --> 01:31:17.200
Tell him <i>it'll</i> do me good.

01:31:17.570 --> 01:31:20.120
I've got such good memories
of last year.

01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:23.240
Go on! Just a few days.

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:25.910
To celebrate our anniversary.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.940
It already smells like the sea.

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:55.940
There's nothing better.

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:19.070
Do you know that Arturo
and I are celebrating our first anniversary?

01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:28.790
And I want to tell you
that with you I've had

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:31.460
the best year of my life.

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:44.840
It's a boob.

01:33:46.890 --> 01:33:47.720
Dani!

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:58.400
It has an inscription.

01:34:00.610 --> 01:34:02.530
“You are our life.

01:34:02.610 --> 01:34:06.070
Natasha, Dani and Arturo”.

01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:08.580
Thanks,honey.

01:34:17.710 --> 01:34:19.300
It's lovely, Dani.

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:46.570
One...

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:48.280
Two...

01:34:48.370 --> 01:34:50.450
Three... Four...

01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:52.370
Five...

01:34:52.450 --> 01:34:53.790
Six...

01:34:54.210 --> 01:34:56.210
- Seven...
- Seven, eight, nine...

01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:00.710
- One thousand?
- That's easy.

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:08.180
Have nice dreams.

01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:33.330
Look, a gynecologist
in swimming trunks!

01:35:47.010 --> 01:35:48.510
How do you feel?

01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:50.850
Very tired.

01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:54.890
But I'm 8 months pregnant,
so that's normal.

01:35:54.970 --> 01:35:56.730
You look great.

01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:59.900
Sun and sea really suit me.

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:03.070
May I examine you?

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:05.190
You just got here.

01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:10.030
- Shall we go into the sea?
- Yes.

01:36:33.390 --> 01:36:35.810
I want to dedicate a song to a friend.

01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:39.850
How am I, Doctor?

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.560
Approaching the goal, right?

01:36:44.230 --> 01:36:45.860
This is for you, Magda.

01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:48.400
To your beautiful madness.

01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:51.450
For everything
you've already given us.

01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:54.830
And for everything
you're going to leave us.

01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:04.090
Magda, you have to consider
going back to Madrid.

01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:08.010
- Why? Am I in a bad way?
- You're doing great.

01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:10.680
You're telling me.

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:13.260
But you should be admitted
until you go into labor.

01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:37.120
<i>Cry because you're afflicted
with a great pain.</i>

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:41.960
<i>A great pain.</i>

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:48.050
<i>Fight to fulfill your dream.</i>

01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:52.430
<i>What a dream.</i>

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:58.810
<i>Laugh because happiness
has caught up with you,</i>

01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:03.520
<i>it has caught up with you.</i>

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:08.320
<i>It's living, it's living.</i>

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:12.320
<i>It's living.</i>

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:16.120
<i>Speak, think,</i>

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:19.660
<i>dream,</i>

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:24.000
<i>cry, fight,</i>

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:27.420
<i>laugh,</i>

01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:31.760
<i>feel, love,</i>

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:35.510
<i>suffer,</i>

01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:39.430
<i>That is living!</i>

01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:43.480
<i>It's living.</i>

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:47.310
<i>Speak, think,</i>

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:50.690
<i>dream,</i>

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:54.860
<i>cry, fight,</i>

01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:58.700
<i>laugh,</i>

01:38:59.030 --> 01:39:02.790
<i>feel, love,</i>

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:06.580
<i>suffer,</i>

01:39:06.670 --> 01:39:10.630
<i>dream of that which was ours,</i>

01:39:10.710 --> 01:39:14.220
<i>hold on to your passions,</i>

01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:18.050
<i>always keep walking straight ahead,</i>

01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:22.770
<i>even if you have to suffer...</i>

01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:30.400
<i>That is living!</i>

01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:03.600
Here, it's for you.

01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:07.140
Thank you.

01:40:09.650 --> 01:40:11.060
How old is she here?

01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:13.940
Five.

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:18.570
- Will I see her when she's five?
- Of course.

01:40:18.650 --> 01:40:19.950
Really? it's that easy?

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:22.620
You're not going to bet?

01:40:25.450 --> 01:40:28.210
Come on, Julián,
I'm not in the water now.

01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:31.170
Here, in your medium,
you can tell me the truth.

01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:33.750
What's the plan?

01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:36.300
We have to do the Cesarian now.

01:40:37.210 --> 01:40:38.300
You girl's fine.

01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:41.260
And she won't need an incubator.

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:47.730
Will I see her? I will?

01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:53.520
And then what?
You're going to destroy my cells again

01:40:53.610 --> 01:40:55.440
with the pretty skin I have now?

01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.650
<i>We'll</i> see, you decide.

01:41:00.490 --> 01:41:01.740
Julián,

01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:03.910
you're an artist.

01:41:03.990 --> 01:41:06.120
Give my girl tons and tons of culture.

01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:08.500
Okay?

01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:21.680
- See you soon.
- Okay.

01:41:36.610 --> 01:41:40.650
- He knows you're sick now.
- Well, we'll discuss my illness later.

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:43.660
Now I'm getting Natasha taken out
and I'll be back later, okay?

01:41:47.410 --> 01:41:48.700
Who's she?

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.210
Natasha, when she's five.

01:41:53.330 --> 01:41:56.040
I want her to have brown hair
and look like you.

01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:58.670
Me too.

01:41:59.210 --> 01:42:01.220
Sure! Genes! Fine.

01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:04.220
We'll see when we look in her eyes.

01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:07.890
Then we'll meet up
and decide who she looks like.

01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:09.470
Okay.

01:42:12.730 --> 01:42:13.560
Arturo.

01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:16.150
Thanks.

01:42:17.650 --> 01:42:19.360
Thank you, honey.

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:22.070
For everything you've done for me.

01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:31.700
Leave me alone with Dani for a moment.

01:42:38.250 --> 01:42:40.130
Your children are my children.

01:42:41.090 --> 01:42:42.920
And you're my only God.

01:43:01.230 --> 01:43:03.610
Dani, do you have an idea now

01:43:03.690 --> 01:43:05.700
what happens to the soul
when the body dies?

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:07.870
No.

01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:10.910
- Have you thought it over?
- Not yet.

01:43:12.490 --> 01:43:15.460
Well, never mind.
You'll have time to think it over.

01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:23.630
But I'm sure of one thing.

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:26.380
The soul never dies.

01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:27.970
That's right!

01:43:28.050 --> 01:43:30.050
Mine will go wherever you want it to.

01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:32.890
You're the thing I love most
in the world.

01:43:32.970 --> 01:43:36.640
Your sister knows that,
so if she ever gets jealous,

01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:38.980
you'll have to be understanding.

01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:40.650
Sure, I'm her big brother.

01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:46.280
A kiss for both of you.

01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:56.830
I'll see you later.

01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:00.330
Honey...

01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:24.860
Let's get the girl out.

01:44:53.010 --> 01:44:54.810
<i>My girl...</i>

01:44:54.890 --> 01:44:57.560
<i>Her eyes are open.</i>

01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:01.060
<i>She's looking at me.</i>

01:45:02.150 --> 01:45:03.560
<i>One,</i>

01:45:04.230 --> 01:45:05.610
<i>two,</i>

01:45:06.230 --> 01:45:07.690
<i>three,</i>

01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:10.650
<i>four,</i>

01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:13.700
<i>five,</i>

01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:17.490
<i>six...</i>

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:32.990
Hello! Hello, chubby!

01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:36.740
Look...

01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:40.040
She has her mother's eyes.

01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:47.330
I love you, Mama.

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:03.680
<i>Think, speak,</i>

01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:06.480
<i>dream,</i>

01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:11.690
<i>cry, fight,</i>

01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:13.990
<i>laugh,</i>

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:19.280
<i>feel, love,</i>

01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:21.490
<i>suffer,</i>

01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:26.040
<i>That is living,</i>

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:28.460
<i>living.</i>

01:47:29.170 --> 01:47:33.260
<i>Cry, fight,</i>

01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:35.630
<i>laugh,</i>
