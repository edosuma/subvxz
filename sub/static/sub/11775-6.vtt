00:05.806 --> 00:08.176
( theme music playing )

00:14.182 --> 00:16.750
- Attendant: WELCOME ABOARD.
- THANKS.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.390
I'M HERE.
EXCUSE ME.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.193
Attendant:
WELCOME ABOARD.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.500
PINKBERRY?

00:33.867 --> 00:35.703
NO, THANK YOU.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.493
ARE YOU REALLY
PUSHING MY DRINK BACK?

00:59.593 --> 01:02.062
ENCROACHMENT.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.964
- ENCROACHMENT?
- YES, YOU'RE ENCROACHING.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.635
OH. SORRY.

01:07.735 --> 01:08.902
THAT'S A PENALTY.

01:09.002 --> 01:11.672
PASSAGE OR PENALTY?

01:14.242 --> 01:16.544
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THESE LACES.

01:16.644 --> 01:19.347
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT
THEY'RE MAKING LACES MUCH
LONGER THAN THEY USED TO?

01:19.447 --> 01:23.016
I'M JUST--
I'M ACTUALLY TRYING
TO READ SOMETHING.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.453
OH, YEAH. SORRY.
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.455
OKAY.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.860
I COULD DO BETTER
THAN THIS.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.130
I'LL PICK IT UP.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.214
EXCUSE ME.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.882
DO YOU MIND MY ASKING
WHERE YOU'RE GOING?

01:54.982 --> 01:56.250
I WAS GOING TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.186
THIS BATHROOM IS FOR
COACH PASSENGERS ONLY.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.154
REALLY?
WHO SAID THAT?

02:00.254 --> 02:02.723
UM, EARLIER I TRIED
TO USE THE ONE UP THERE

02:02.823 --> 02:06.294
AND I WAS TOLD THAT,
YOU KNOW, COACH ISN'T ALLOWED
TO USE FIRST CLASS.

02:06.394 --> 02:09.497
- WE HAVE OUR DIFFERENT AREAS.
- I AM SO SORRY THAT
THEY DID THAT.

02:09.597 --> 02:12.233
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.
- THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.668
WELL, I UNDERSTAND
AND I EMPATHIZE WITH YOU

02:14.768 --> 02:16.370
- THAT YOU WEREN'T
ALLOWED TO DO THAT.
- THANK YOU.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.472
BUT I'M STILL GOING
TO USE THE BATHROOM.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.074
- WHY WOULD-- WHY?
- I DIDN'T STOP YOU
FROM USING THAT BATHROOM.

02:21.175 --> 02:24.111
OH, 'CAUSE YOU'RE IN
FIRST CLASS SO YOU GET TO DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.679
- NOT AT ALL.
- YOU GET ON FIRST.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.948
- YOU GET FREE DRINKS.
YOU GET A HOT TOWEL.
- NO NO.

02:28.048 --> 02:31.151
JUST 'CAUSE I'M SITTING
UP THERE YOU'RE MAKING
A GENERALIZATION ABOUT ME.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.654
BUT I'M NOT LIKE
A FIRST-CLASS PERSON.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.690
- I'M COACHY.
- IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE NOT
ACTING COACHY.

02:36.790 --> 02:39.126
- I DIDN'T STOP YOU.
- YOU'RE NOT ACTING COACHY.
YOU'RE ACTING FIRST CLASSY.

02:39.227 --> 02:42.496
- I'M COACHY.
- NO, BUT YOU JUST THINK
YOU GET TO WALK BACK HERE--

02:42.596 --> 02:44.932
- YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG, OKAY?
- OH, I'M SURE THAT I DO.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.100
YOU'D BE UP IN
FIRST CLASS IF SOMEONE
BOUGHT YOU A TICKET.

02:47.201 --> 02:50.438
- POOR
MISUNDERSTOOD FIRST CLASS.
- OH, POOR LITTLE COACHY GIRL.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.140
- I GET EVERYTHING.
- SHE'S SO JEALOUS
'CAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE

02:53.241 --> 02:55.209
IS MORE COMFORTABLE
THAN THE COACHY GIRL.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.110
I JUST WANT TO PEE
SOMEWHERE-- EVERYWHERE.

02:57.211 --> 03:00.648
- I HAVE NOTHING.
- ( both mock crying )

03:03.684 --> 03:05.386
MISS.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.889
MISS.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.358
YES SIR,
CAN I HELP YOU?

03:10.458 --> 03:12.393
YEAH, I'D LIKE
ANOTHER DRINK, PLEASE.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.127
UM, I ACTUALLY THINK YOU
MIGHT HAVE HAD ENOUGH.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.764
( humming )

03:20.968 --> 03:22.436
NO, I DON'T WANT WATER.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.905
I SAID SCOTCH
WITH TWO ICE CUBES.
NO WATER.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.007
- I CANNOT SERVE YOU
ANY MORE ALCOHOL.
- WHAT?

03:27.107 --> 03:29.710
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE,
I'LL GET IT MYSELF.
WHERE'S THE DRINK CART?

03:29.810 --> 03:33.447
( humming )

03:33.547 --> 03:35.683
- SHUT UP!
- SIR, GET OUT OF MY FACE
AND SIT.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.585
YOU GET OUT OF MY FACE.
JUST GET THE FUCKING DRINK.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.487
THAT IS IT.
I'M GOING TO SPEAK
TO THE CAPTAIN.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.722
NO, I AM GOING
TO SPEAK TO THE CAPTAIN.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.224
WHY CAN'T I HAVE
ANOTHER FUCKING DRINK?

03:44.325 --> 03:46.126
- ( passengers gasp )
- ( man shrieking )

03:46.226 --> 03:49.363
OH NO, I'LL STOP.
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.
DON'T HURT ME.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.366
DON'T HURT ME.
I'LL GO BACK TO MY SEAT.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.235
- PLEASE DON'T HIT ME.
- I-- I JUST-- IT WAS--

03:55.336 --> 03:57.605
- DON'T HIT ME ANYMORE.
- I DIDN'T REALLY--

03:57.705 --> 04:01.008
THANK YOU.
SIR, THAT MAN WAS ABUSIVE
AND HE WAS DRUNK.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.944
- THANK YOU.
- ( applauding )

04:06.347 --> 04:08.716
Man:
GOOD JOB.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.821
TRYING TO HELP.
I WAS HELPING OUT.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.789
SOMEBODY HAD TO HELP HER.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.791
OH, PLEASE.

04:17.891 --> 04:20.494
OH MY-- OH.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.897
- THANK YOU.
- Susie: WHAT HAPPENED?

04:23.997 --> 04:26.467
- THAT WAS YOU?
- THAT WAS ME.
I JUMPED ON HIM.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.702
- CRAZY.
WHAT MOTIVATED YOU?
- YEAH.

04:28.802 --> 04:32.740
YOU KNOW, UH, HE WAS
ABUSING THE STEWARDESS

04:32.840 --> 04:34.575
AND I JUST DID IT.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.810
- LOOK AT YOU.
HOW ABOUT THAT?
- SO NOT LIKE YOU.

04:36.910 --> 04:40.481
- I DIDN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT REALLY.
- GOD, YOU'RE VERY BRAVE.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.282
HUH.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.284
YOU ARE.
YOU'RE A HERO.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.954
THAT TOO, I SUPPOSE.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.756
I'M DONNA, BY THE WAY.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.524
OH HEY.
LARRY.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.860
LARRY.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.929
- THANK YOU.
- PFFT.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.793
Larry:
WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH
THESE SHOELACES NOW?

05:25.893 --> 05:27.395
THEY MAKE THEM SO LONG.

05:27.495 --> 05:30.263
I MEAN, I'M TRIPPING OVER
THESE LACES FIVE TIMES A DAY.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.865
BUT YOU GOT
A GIRL OUT OF IT.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.667
SHE THINKS I'M A HERO.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.103
ONLY YOU AND I KNOW YOU
WEREN'T AN INTENTIONAL HERO.

05:36.203 --> 05:39.540
YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY
WAY IN THE WORLD I WOULD HAVE
DONE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT GUY?

05:39.640 --> 05:43.243
IMPOSSIBLE.
RICKY GERVAIS IS SITTING
IN THE BOOTH BEHIND YOU.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.045
- OH, REALLY?
- YUP.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.580
CAN I TURN AROUND
OR IS THAT--

05:46.680 --> 05:48.416
- ALL RIGHT,
ARE WE READY?
- YEAH.

05:48.516 --> 05:51.585
YOU KNOW THEY REPLACED
ALL THE LIGHTING HERE.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.755
- OH YEAH, IT'S VERY NICE.
- AND THEN REALLY WENT WITH
WHAT YOU GOT OVER THERE.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.491
SO IT'S ALL-- AND THEN
I KEEP THIS GOING UNTIL
YOU'VE TURNED AROUND.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.259
- THERE YOU GO.
- OKAY, YEAH.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.495
HE'S IN TOWN DOING A PLAY
RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.031
OH YEAH,
I HEARD ABOUT THAT PLAY.
WHAT'S IT CALLED?

06:04.131 --> 06:06.434
UH, "MR. HIGGINBOTHAM"?

06:06.534 --> 06:08.602
- "MISTER SIMMINGTON." YES.
- "MISTER SIMMINGTON."

06:08.702 --> 06:11.705
I'VE BEEN HOPING TO SIGN HIM.
I JUST-- I LOVE HIM.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.274
- HE'D BE GREAT TO HAVE.
- YEAH, HE'S GREAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:14.374 --> 06:16.644
- I'M GONNA BUY HIM
A BOTTLE OF WINE.
- GREAT MOVE. WHY NOT?

06:16.744 --> 06:19.813
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO GET A BOTTLE OF WINE
FOR MR. GERVAIS?

06:21.415 --> 06:23.617
- SURE.
- HOW DID YOU--

06:23.717 --> 06:26.119
- OKAY.
YEAH, SURE. PLEASE.
- EXCELLENT.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.423
- OKAY.
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT.

06:29.523 --> 06:32.292
SEE, YOU'VE GOT TO BE
CAREFUL WITH THESE WAITERS.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.395
THEY COME OVER TO YOUR TABLE,
THEY EAVESDROP.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.930
I THINK THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
ALWAYS POURING THE WATER.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.066
- YEAH.
- YOU CAN'T SAY
ANYTHING PERSONAL.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.869
I THINK THAT'S ONE
OF THE PERKS OF THE JOB
IS PICKING UP THE TIDBITS.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.437
IT'S A TIDBIT FESTIVAL.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.573
- EXCUSE ME.
- YES?

06:45.673 --> 06:47.941
- DID HE ORDER THE WINE?
- YES, HE GOT A VERY NICE
BOTTLE.

06:48.041 --> 06:51.612
IN FACT, IT WAS A $300 BOTTLE.
SO THE BEST IN THE HOUSE.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.683
ENJOY.

06:55.783 --> 06:59.620
A $300 BOTTLE OF WINE?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

06:59.720 --> 07:02.523
LOOK.

07:02.623 --> 07:06.093
HE LOOKS VERY HAPPY.

07:08.662 --> 07:11.532
I'M SORRY, THAT'S COMPLETELY
INAPPROPRIATE.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.233
- IT IS INAPPROPRIATE.
- IT'S REALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.837
I AGREE WITH YOU.
BUT LISTEN, MAN,
I AM STARVING.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.673
MY BLOOD SUGAR IS JUST
GOING DOWN TO MY FEET.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.209
IF I DON'T EAT SOMETHING--
I FEEL, LIKE, FAINT.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.578
- OUR FOOD'S SITTING UP THERE.
- OUR FOOD'S SITTING UP THERE?

07:24.678 --> 07:26.446
- YEAH.
- WELL, WHAT THE FUCK?

07:26.547 --> 07:29.316
WHAT IS HE DOING?
HE'S JUST SITTING THERE
SCHMOOZING WITH THEM?

07:29.416 --> 07:31.384
YEAH, IT'S LIKE HE FOUND
A NEW BEST FRIEND.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.420
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HOW ABOUT IF I JUST GO GET IT?

07:33.521 --> 07:35.188
- IF YOU DO THAT
YOU'RE A HERO.
- REALLY?

07:35.288 --> 07:36.389
- YOU'RE A HERO.
- YOU GOT IT, PAL.

07:36.490 --> 07:39.459
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

07:42.095 --> 07:45.533
- ( laughing )
- ONE FOR YOU AND ONE FOR ME.

07:45.633 --> 07:49.637
FANTASTIC.
OH YES.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.508
- ENJOYING YOUR MEAL?
- AS A MATTER OF FACT I AM.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.944
UM, WHERE DID
THIS FOOD COME FROM?

07:57.044 --> 07:58.879
I BROUGHT IT HERE.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.182
YOU UNDERSTAND
I'M THE WAITER?

08:02.282 --> 08:04.718
YET WE WERE THE ONES
WHO WERE DOING THE WAITING.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.119
SO WE BECAME THE WAITERS.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.755
THIS MAN IS A HERO.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.190
HE JUST REVOLUTIONIZED THE WAY
RESTAURANTS WORK, MY FRIEND.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.159
NO ONE'S GONNA
GO HUNGRY AGAIN.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.228
- SORRY.
- GENTLEMEN.

08:19.066 --> 08:22.202
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE,
QUITE HONESTLY,

08:22.302 --> 08:25.639
THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
ON THE PLANE, LARRY.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.475
- HONESTLY, IT WAS NOTHING.
- I THINK PEOPLE NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.944
I MEAN, DO YOU REMEMBER
SULLY SULLENBERGER?

08:31.044 --> 08:32.913
- SULLY, YEAH.
- SULLY SULLENBERGER.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.282
WHEN HE LANDED THAT PLANE
IN NEW YORK CITY

08:35.382 --> 08:38.919
RIGHT THERE IN THE WATER,
THAT WAS INSPIRING TO PEOPLE.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.488
THAT'S INTERESTING.
I NEVER MADE THE SULLY
CONNECTION BEFORE.

08:41.589 --> 08:44.491
I WONDER WHAT SULLY WOULD HAVE
DONE IF HE WAS IN MY SHOES?

08:44.592 --> 08:46.594
NOT THAT I'M COMPARING
MYSELF TO SULLY.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.428
PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW
THAT YOU DID THIS.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.331
THIS IS A WHOLE OTHER
SIDE OF YOU THAT PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

08:51.431 --> 08:54.768
YOU KNOW ABOUT IT.
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.

08:56.469 --> 08:59.539
- OKAY.
- IF YOU WANT TO CALL SULLY...

08:59.640 --> 09:02.142
- ( laughs )
- IF WE CAN GET SULLY'S NUMBER

09:02.242 --> 09:05.913
- YOU CAN TELL SULLY, OKAY?
- YOU'RE TOO MODEST.

09:06.013 --> 09:09.282
IT'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW?
I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN
TESTED LIKE THAT BEFORE.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.852
- HMM.
- DIDN'T FIGHT IN A WAR.

09:11.952 --> 09:16.156
ONCE I WENT TO THE SEVENTH GAME
OF A WORLD SERIES

09:16.256 --> 09:19.326
AND CAME HOME ON THE SUBWAY
AND IT WAS VERY CROWDED

09:19.426 --> 09:22.095
AND HOT AND DISGUSTING.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.598
- PEOPLE WERE SWEATING ON ME.
- HMM.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.800
BUT I MAINTAINED
MY COMPOSURE.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.301
I THOUGHT THAT
WAS A GOOD SIGN.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.605
THANK GOD YOU WERE ON THE PLANE.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.542
- YOU COULD SAY MORE.
- I COULD?

09:35.643 --> 09:37.577
- YEAH.
- ( laughs )

09:41.248 --> 09:42.983
KEEP THE CHANGE.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.353
- THIS IS WHERE THEY LIVE?
- THEY LIVE AROUND THE CORNER.

09:46.453 --> 09:49.322
BUT I WANT TO STOP AT
THE BAKERY AND GET SOME BREAD.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.624
NO WINE?

09:50.724 --> 09:53.994
EVERYBODY BRINGS WINE.
I BRING BREAD.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.029
OH.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.236
( doorbell buzzes )

10:03.336 --> 10:05.739
- AH, HELLO.
- HELLO.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.975
- HELLO, DONNA.
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- HI.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.711
- GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.
- THE FOOD'S GONNA BE A LOT
BETTER HERE

10:10.811 --> 10:12.445
THAN ON THE PLANE,
I GUARANTEE.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.182
WHAT IS THAT, LAR?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.685
ENJOY.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.787
THIS IS WHAT YOU BRING?

10:19.887 --> 10:21.454
- IT'S ITALIAN BREAD.
- YEAH.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.323
YEAH, BUT THIS
DOESN'T GO WITH MY MENU.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.758
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SERVING.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.527
DON'T IMPOSE YOUR DESIRES
ON MY WHOLE CUISINE.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.964
- IT'S DELICIOUS.
- EVERYONE BRINGS WINE
OR MAYBE SOME NUTS.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.200
- THAT'S THE POINT.
EVERYBODY BRINGS THAT.
- YOU BRING BREAD.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.569
- IF EVERYBODY'S
BRINGING THAT--
- AH, RICARDO.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.339
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M SO EXCITED
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.874
STAR POWER.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.677
STAR POWER AT
MY DINNER PARTY, HUH?

10:43.777 --> 10:45.312
- THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING.
- A LITTLE GIFT.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.781
OH MY GOD.
OH MY GOD, I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.282
- SIGNED.
- SIGNED.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.819
THE FUNNIEST SHOW IN
THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.620
- IT WAS FUNNY.
- I LOVE THIS SHOW.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.956
I WOULDN'T CALL IT
THE FUNNIEST SHOW IN
THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.125
I WOULD, LAR.
THIS SHOW WAS HILARIOUS.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.227
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, FUNNY SHOW.
BUT THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION?

11:00.327 --> 11:01.862
"SEINFELD," LOVELY SHOW.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.864
WELL, THANK YOU.
IT WAS GOOD.
THERE WAS GOOD.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.466
- OH NO, I LOVE BROAD COMEDY.
- YEAH.

11:06.566 --> 11:09.036
- I WILL TREASURE THIS, RICKY.
- I LOVE THE LAUGH TRACK ON IT.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.805
- I'M SO HAPPY HE'S HERE.
- IT REMINDS YOU WHEN TO LAUGH.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.307
- WE DIDN'T DO ONE.
- IT'S A VERY FUNNY SHOW.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.844
IT'S JUST ODD TO JUST SHOW
UP WITH YOUR OWN DVD.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.212
- YEAH.
- NEVER HEARD OF SOMEBODY

11:19.312 --> 11:22.415
WHO'S IN SOMETHING AND THEN
SHOWING UP WITH IT.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.218
- YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT?
- NO, IT'S AN ODD THING.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.020
WHAT, DO YOU MEAN
IT'S ODD BECAUSE YOU'VE
NEVER HEARD OF IT?

11:27.120 --> 11:29.489
- YOU DON'T KNOW
EVERYTHING, DO YOU?
- WELL, NO.

11:29.589 --> 11:32.592
I'M SURE THERE'S LOADS OF
THINGS THAT GO ON THAT YOU'VE
NEVER HEARD OF THAT AREN'T ODD.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.561
WHAT'S THIS DEAL?
YOU GOT A SCARF?

11:34.661 --> 11:37.898
YEAH, I WANT TO KEEP
MY THROAT WARM 'CAUSE
I'M IN A PLAY AT THE MOMENT.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.734
SO I HAVE TO
PROJECT EVERYTHING.
IT'S NOT LIKE TV.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.235
- IF YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING...
- NOT AT ALL.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.704
IT LOOKS SLIGHTLY AFFECTED.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.139
YEAH, I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT THAT.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.641
BUT ONE PERSON
THINKING IT'S AFFECTED,

11:48.742 --> 11:49.910
1,000 PEOPLE LET DOWN...

11:50.010 --> 11:51.478
- I GET IT.
- YEAH.

11:51.578 --> 11:52.946
SO WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THIS PLAY?

11:53.046 --> 11:55.015
- "MISTER SIMMINGTON."
- WHAT IS IT? IS IT DRAMA?

11:55.115 --> 11:57.217
- YEAH, VERY MUCH SO.
- REALLY?

11:57.317 --> 12:01.088
IT'S ONE MAN'S FEAR OF
THE OUTBREAK OF WORLD WAR I.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.423
AND HE'S WORRIED ABOUT
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO BRITAIN.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.259
IT'S A SORT OF
DOUBLE-EDGED STORY

12:06.359 --> 12:08.695
BECAUSE THE PARALLEL IS
HE'S FIGHTING HIS OWN WAR,
A CLASS WAR.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.131
- IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT.
- YOU SHOULD COME ALONG
AND SEE IT TOMORROW NIGHT.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.732
I'LL GET YOU
A COUPLE OF TICKETS.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.668
JEFF AND SUSIE ARE COMING.
SO JOIN THE PARTY.

12:15.769 --> 12:18.105
OH, UM...

12:18.205 --> 12:20.941
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'D LOVE TO.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.911
DONNA IS WORKING
TOMORROW NIGHT.
SHE CAN'T COME.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.578
BUT YOU COULD
STILL COME THOUGH.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.448
COME ALONG.
YOU CAN'T TALK TO HER ANYWAY
DURING A PLAY, CAN YOU?

12:28.548 --> 12:30.918
SO YOU'RE NOT REALLY
MISSING HER FOR THAT
THREE AND A HALF HOURS.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.886
- THREE AND A HALF?
- YEAH.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.722
- MMM.
- DRINKS IN THE INTERVAL.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.657
- "MISTER SIMMINGTON" IT IS.
- EXCELLENT.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.227
TICKETS WILL BE
AT THE BOX OFFICE.

12:40.327 --> 12:43.063
- LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
- GO ON.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.899
DID YOU ENJOY THE WINE
THE OTHER DAY?

12:45.999 --> 12:47.734
OH, THANK YOU, YES.
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.

12:47.835 --> 12:51.404
- I HOPE SO BECAUSE IT
COST A LOT OF MONEY.
- IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.240
- SO I HOPE IT WAS
GOOD FOR THAT PRICE.
- IT WAS GREAT. REALLY GREAT.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.575
YOU KNOW, IT WAS LIKE
A $300 BOTTLE OF WINE.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.144
WAS IT?
I DIDN'T LOOK AT THE PRICE.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.046
- YOU DIDN'T?
- NO, NOT WHEN IT'S A GIFT.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.780
- THAT'S KIND OF ODD, ISN'T IT?
- NO, NOT WHEN IT'S A GIFT.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.415
- REALLY? DOES IT?
- IT RUINS IT. YEAH.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.051
HUH, INTERESTING.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.053
'CAUSE THEN YOU PUT A MONETARY
VALUE ON SOMEONE'S GESTURE.

13:06.153 --> 13:09.756
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK
THAT YOU MAY HAVE TAKEN
A LITTLE ADVANTAGE.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.724
WHO? WHO?

13:11.825 --> 13:15.095
- WELL, I SUPPOSE
IF YOU TOOK A SURVEY--
- WHY WOULD YOU EVER DO THAT?

13:15.195 --> 13:17.197
- JUST TO SEE.
JUST TO GET AN ANSWER.
- OKAY.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.299
- AND YOU SAY TO THIS PERSON...
- YEAH.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.836
...IF SOMEBODY OFFERED YOU A
BOTTLE OF WINE IN A RESTAURANT,

13:22.936 --> 13:24.905
HOW EXPENSIVE A BOTTLE
OF WINE WOULD YOU ORDER?

13:25.005 --> 13:27.674
I WOULD THINK I'D
BETTER LOOK AT THE PRICE.
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE.

13:27.774 --> 13:29.943
HERE'S MY DVD-- $30.
NO, I'D NEVER SAY IT.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.344
THIS VERY GENEROUS PERSON
BOUGHT ME A BOTTLE OF WINE,

13:31.444 --> 13:33.313
I DON'T THINK I'LL TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF HIM.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.815
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S A GIFT, THAT'S
HOW I LOOK AT IT.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.450
Susie:
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
DINNER IS SERVED.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.888
THERE'S PLACE CARDS
ON THE TABLE.
FIND YOUR NAME.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.090
I'VE DONE SOMETHING A LITTLE
INTERESTING AND DIFFERENT.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.058
- DONNA, YOU'RE OVER THERE
NEXT TO RICKY.
- OKAY.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.694
- I'VE SEPARATED THE COUPLES.
- WHAT?

13:47.794 --> 13:50.230
- I THOUGHT IT'D BE FUN.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
SEPARATING THE COUPLES?

13:50.330 --> 13:52.299
- I SEPARATED THE COUPLES.
- WHY? WHAT'S THE POINT
OF THAT?

13:52.399 --> 13:54.267
- MEET NEW PEOPLE, MINGLE.
- I DON'T WANT TO MEET
NEW PEOPLE.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.870
- I DON'T WANT TO MINGLE.
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO

13:56.970 --> 13:58.906
BECAUSE YOU'RE SITTING
DOWN THERE NEXT TO HANK.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.674
- I HAVE TO SIT NEXT TO SOME
STRANGER FOR THREE HOURS?
- JUST GO DO IT.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.077
- JUST GO, OKAY?
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
RIDICULOUS.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.380
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
BON APPÃ©TIT.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.249
- Ricky: LOOKS AMAZING.
- Susie: DOESN'T IT?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.351
THANK YOU.
TO OUR FIRST DINNER PARTY.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.486
- CHEERS.
- All: CHEERS.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.322
Jeff:
FIRST OF MANY.

14:15.422 --> 14:16.856
Susie:
WE'RE JUST HERE FOR THE SUMME.
WE'RE SUBLETTING.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.292
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- HEY.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.929
OH, YOU'RE MARRIED
TO THE ACTRESS, RIGHT?

14:22.029 --> 14:24.731
I AM. I AM THE HUSBAND
OF THE BRIT.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.866
- I'M HANK.
- YEAH WELL, HI. LARRY.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.003
- HEY, LARRY.
- I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY HAD
TO SEPARATE THE COUPLES.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.739
I MEAN, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU KNOW, TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.807
( people laughing )

14:34.908 --> 14:37.744
TURNED OUT TO BE A DOOR
FOR GOOD SKIN SO HE WASN'T
A PEDOPHILE AT ALL.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.413
- ( laughing )
- OH MY GOD.

14:40.513 --> 14:43.683
Ricky:
THAT'S TRUE.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.953
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU

14:46.053 --> 14:48.721
I GUESSED YOU
FOR A SPANIARD.

14:48.821 --> 14:51.058
YEAH.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.994
- I'M GLAD
YOU'RE NOT SPANISH.
- REALLY?

14:54.094 --> 14:56.363
I'M NOT A FAN OF THE SPANISH.

14:56.463 --> 14:57.764
WHY IS THAT?

14:57.864 --> 15:01.768
IT'S A PERSONAL THING.
I GOT PICKED ON A LOT
BY SOME KIDS.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.203
BY SPANIARDS?

15:03.303 --> 15:06.106
YEAH.
WELL, THEY SPOKE SPANISH.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.141
OH, THEY'RE NOT
FROM SPAIN?

15:08.241 --> 15:09.676
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THEY WERE FROM.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.479
- ( banging )
- OH MY GOD.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.082
- WHAT IS THAT?
- I'M SORRY, I'VE SHATTERED
YOUR BREAD.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.684
WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S NOT MY BREAD.
LARRY BROUGHT IT.

15:17.784 --> 15:20.153
- IT'S HARD, HUH?
- WOW.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.455
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HARD.
- NOT THIS HARD.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.524
YES. YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT BREAD.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.893
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE MEANT
TO BE ABLE TO EAT
IT AT LEAST.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.162
RIGHT. IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE TOASTED, OKAY?

15:29.262 --> 15:31.331
TOASTED WITH SOME BUTTER
AND MAYBE A LITTLE GARLIC.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.266
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS
AND NEIGHBORS

15:33.366 --> 15:36.403
DOWN AT THAT END OF THE TABLE.
ANNOYING EVERYBODY.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.110
I DON'T REALLY EVEN KNOW
HOW TO WRITE CURSIVE ANYMORE.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.018
SO HOW'S YOUR MARRIAGE?

15:51.118 --> 15:53.186
WHAT THE HELL?

15:53.987 --> 15:56.089
WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME THAT?

15:56.189 --> 15:59.892
I'M TRYING TO ELEVATE
SMALL TALK TO MEDIUM TALK.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.594
OKAY, FINE.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.663
UM...

16:03.763 --> 16:05.098
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.834
YOU KNOW, IT'S FINE.
IT'S OKAY.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.769
HOW OFTEN DO YOU HAVE SEX?

16:09.869 --> 16:12.439
- ALMOST NEVER.
- HMM.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.107
( Donna laughing )

16:14.207 --> 16:16.409
WHAT WE DID IS WE MADE
ANOTHER ONE FURTHER DOWN

16:16.509 --> 16:19.946
- AND HIS LITTLE PLUMS
ARE HANGING DOWN.
- Jeff: HIS PLUMS!

16:20.047 --> 16:22.415
WE COVERED THEM
IN BREADCRUMBS

16:22.515 --> 16:25.052
SO THE CARP WOULD SORT OF
JUMP AND NIP AT THEM.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.754
YEAH, IT WAS AMAZING.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.090
- Jeff: YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
- Larry: YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:30.190 --> 16:32.492
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS NOT FAIR
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.094
- THIS IS NOT FAIR.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

16:34.194 --> 16:35.595
YOU SAY YOU'RE SEPARATING
THE COUPLES?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.297
- YOU'RE NOT SEPARATED.
- WE'RE THE HOSTS.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.399
OH, YOU'RE THE HOSTS?
YOU FIXED THIS WHOLE
THING, OKAY?

16:39.499 --> 16:41.634
YOU FIXED IT ALL SO YOU
COULD BE AT THE COOL TABLE.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.604
YOU GOT RICKY GERVAIS,
YOU GOT ALLY, YOU GOT
YOUR BROADWAY STARS.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.806
- GO BACK AND SIT DOWN.
- THE COOL TABLE?

16:46.906 --> 16:48.141
WHAT ARE YOU,
IN THIRD GRADE?

16:48.241 --> 16:49.876
EXCUSE ME, SUSIE.
WHERE IS THE TOILET?

16:49.976 --> 16:51.578
- OOH!
- Susie: OH MY GOSH!

16:51.678 --> 16:55.048
SO SORRY.
RICKY, CAN I PLEASE
PAY YOU FOR THAT?

16:55.148 --> 16:57.350
OH, DON'T.
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.920
- IT'S OKAY, I INSIST.
- IT'S A $500 SCARF.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.123
THAT'S OKAY.
I'M GOOD FOR IT.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.825
- HANK, WHAT HAPPENED?
- I TRIPPED OVER MY SHOELACES.

17:05.925 --> 17:08.761
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW
LARRY FELL INTO THE GUY
ON THE PLANE.

17:08.861 --> 17:12.399
- WHAT?
- ON THE PLANE HE TRIPPED
OVER HIS SHOELACES.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.469
Donna:
LARRY, IS THAT TRUE?

17:23.009 --> 17:25.712
YOU KNOW WHAT, LARRY?
I THINK YOU'RE TAKING THE WRONG
TACTIC WITH THESE WOMEN.

17:25.812 --> 17:29.416
I REALLY DO.
I THINK YOU HAVE TO PRESENT
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.184
- OTHERWISE YOU GET STUCK.
- I DID PRESENT WHO
I REALLY WAS--

17:31.284 --> 17:33.653
A PHONY, A FRAUD,
A PREVARICATOR.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.955
- I PRESENTED WHO I WAS.
- NO, IT'S BETTER SHE KNOWS
WHO YOU ARE.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.290
AND SHE EITHER
ACCEPTS YOU OR NOT.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.691
I TOOK HER HOME
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.927
SHE WAS SO COLD.
SHE'S LOST ALL RESPECT
FOR ME.

17:41.027 --> 17:44.464
HONESTLY, THIS WHOLE THING
NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF
YOU DIDN'T SEPARATE THE COUPLES.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.033
WE BECAME A COUPLE BECAUSE WE
DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEPARATED.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.502
MY DINNER PARTY,
YOU PLAY BY MY RULES.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.571
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T INVITE ME ANYMORE.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

17:51.671 --> 17:55.442
I DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE.
YOU'RE LIKE AN APPENDAGE TO US.

17:55.542 --> 17:59.379
HEY, LARRY DAVID.
RICKY GERVAIS LEFT
A TICKET FOR ME.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.682
HERE YOU GO.
IT'S $200.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.219
THEY'RE CHARGING ME $200
FOR THE TICKET.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.255
I THOUGHT HE WAS GIVING
IT TO ME FOR FREE.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.490
- WHAT CAN YOU DO?
- WHAT IS IT WITH THIS GUY?

18:10.590 --> 18:13.326
- HE'S COSTING ME A FORTUNE.
- JUST PAY. WE'RE HERE.

18:16.663 --> 18:20.099
- AT LEAST THE SEATS ARE GOOD.
- YEAH. THANK YOU.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.369
- NICE FULL HOUSE.
- GOOD SEATS.

18:22.469 --> 18:25.205
YEAH, FULL HOUSE.
OH, HERE.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.275
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I WANT THE AISLE.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.510
THAT'S MY TICKET.
I HAD THE AISLE TICKET.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.313
LARRY, WE HAD THREE SEATS,
THEY WERE THE HOUSE SEATS

18:33.413 --> 18:36.216
AND ANY ONE OF US COULD SIT
IN ANY OF THESE SEATS.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.917
NO, YOU WEREN'T THERE
WHEN I GOT THE ENVELOPES.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.252
I TOOK THEM OUT
AND PUT THEM TOGETHER.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.154
HEY, DON'T FUCK
THINGS UP FOR ME.
SIT DOWN.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.055
GOD DAMN IT.
SIT NEXT TO YOUR HUSBAND.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.757
I DON'T WANT TO SIT
NEXT TO MY HUSBAND.
I'M WITH HIM ALL THE TIME.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.326
HE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND,
YOU SIT NEXT TO HIM.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.727
LAST NIGHT IT WAS OKAY
TO SIT NEXT TO HIM.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.629
THAT WAS FINE, RIGHT?
YOU SEPARATE THE COUPLES

18:49.729 --> 18:51.798
BUT YOU SIT NEXT
TO YOUR HUSBAND.
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.301
- WHAT ARE YOU CONFUSED ABOUT?
- LAST NIGHT'S VERY REGIMENTED.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.102
OKAY? AND TONIGHT IT'S LIKE
A FREE-FOR-ALL, IS THAT IT?

18:56.203 --> 18:57.604
- I WANT THE AISLE.
- KEEP YOUR VOICES DOWN.

18:57.704 --> 19:01.441
- I'M VERY CONFUSED.
- ( applause )

19:01.541 --> 19:04.511
( dramatic music playing )

19:12.319 --> 19:15.822
Ally:
MR. SIMMINGTON!
MR. SIMMINGTON!

19:15.922 --> 19:17.457
Ricky:
YES? YES?

19:17.557 --> 19:19.125
- WHAT?
- HAVE YOU HEARD?

19:19.226 --> 19:22.329
OF COURSE I'VE HEARD.
IT'S IN THE MORNING PAPER.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.431
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
THAT ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND

19:24.531 --> 19:26.098
IS STRUCK DOWN
BY AN ASSASSIN'S BULLET.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.635
I'M SCRUNCHED IN HERE.
I WANT THAT SEAT.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.471
- OH, FUCK YOU, LARRY.
I'M THE GIRL.
- SHUT UP.

19:31.571 --> 19:34.106
YOU'RE A GIRL?
YOU'RE A WITCH.

19:34.207 --> 19:37.043
AND SHOULD IT BE
A LIFE THEY GIVE,

19:37.143 --> 19:39.412
THEN THEY WILL
GIVE IT GLADLY.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.382
- ( arguing )
- THIS UNFORG--

19:44.984 --> 19:46.185
( arguing continues )

19:46.286 --> 19:48.321
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

19:48.421 --> 19:52.124
IF THAT IS SO,
THEN I AM DONE.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.993
- SHALL I LOSE YOU?
- ( arguing continues )

19:54.093 --> 19:56.596
SHALL I LOSE ROBERT?

19:56.696 --> 19:58.998
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

19:59.098 --> 20:02.201
I-- I WILL DO
MY DUTY GLADLY.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.136
HOW AM I GONNA WATCH
THIS FOR THREE HOURS?

20:04.237 --> 20:06.005
IT'S GONNA BE ROUGH
FOR ALL OF US.

20:06.105 --> 20:09.242
SHH.
WATCH THE PLAY.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.580
DID YOU HEAR THE FUCKING
IDIOTS TALKING ALL THE WAY
THROUGH AS WELL?

20:13.680 --> 20:15.748
- JUST LIKE "BIP BIP BIP."
- YOU WERE FANTASTIC.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.518
- REALLY?
- IN FACT, I WAS ABLE
TO OVERHEAR

20:18.618 --> 20:20.687
WHAT THE WHOLE TO-DO
WAS ABOUT.

20:20.787 --> 20:24.457
YEAH, THERE WAS A WOMAN
AND SHE TOOK A SEAT THAT
DIDN'T BELONG TO HER.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.927
SHE WAS A HIDEOUS
HIDEOUS LOOKING PERSON.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.263
Susie:
I DON'T THINK YOU GOT
A GOOD LOOK, LARRY.

20:30.363 --> 20:33.600
- I GOT A GREAT LOOK.
- THE WOMAN WAS QUITE
ATTRACTIVE IF I RECALL.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.935
- MAYBE ON SOME BIZARRO PLANET.
- MM-HMM.

20:36.035 --> 20:39.306
LISTEN, YOU WERE GREAT.
FORGET ABOUT THEM.
YOU WERE GREAT.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.841
NO, HONESTLY, THAT'S
THE WORST I'VE EVER BEEN.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.277
THAT WAS, LIKE--
THAT WAS-- AT MOST THAT
WAS NINE OUT OF 10.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.145
AND USUALLY
I'M 10 OUT OF 10.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.380
- THAT WAS A NINE OUT OF 10?
- A NINE?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.849
- YEAH.
- Larry: SEEMS A BIT HIGH.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.685
- HOW MUCH THEATER DO YOU SEE?
- I SAW "OKLAHOMA."

20:52.785 --> 20:55.622
- FRIVOLOUS NONSENSE
FOR THE MORONIC CLASSES.
- OH REALLY?

20:55.722 --> 20:57.890
ARE YOU KIDDING?
"OKLAHOMA"?

20:57.990 --> 21:00.627
"OH WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MORNING,
OH WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

21:00.727 --> 21:05.565
I'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL FEELING,
EVERYTHING'S GOING MY WAY."

21:05.665 --> 21:07.266
- OH DEAR.
- OH, COME ON.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.637
YOU'RE COMPARING THIS THING
WE SAW TONIGHT

21:10.737 --> 21:12.839
TO A ROGERS
AND HAMMERSTEIN MUSICAL?

21:12.939 --> 21:15.642
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT.
- THIS IS ABOUT LIFE
AND DEATH AND WAR.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.544
- THIS IS ABOUT
THE HUMAN SPIRIT.
- YEAH.

21:17.644 --> 21:20.980
"POOR JUD IS DEAD.
POOR JUD IS DEAD."

21:21.080 --> 21:23.115
- PLEASE.
- BUBBLEGUM.

21:23.215 --> 21:24.951
HOW LONG YOU GOT
TO DO THIS PLAY FOR?

21:25.051 --> 21:28.588
THE RUN'S BEEN EXTENDED,
SO ANOTHER SIX WEEKS.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.723
MUST BE HARD TO DO
ALL THAT FAKE CRYING.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.592
- NO, THEY'RE REAL TEARS.
- THOSE ARE REAL TEARS?

21:32.692 --> 21:34.827
- OF COURSE, REAL TEARS
EVERY NIGHT.
- SERIOUSLY?

21:34.927 --> 21:36.396
( chuckles )
COME ON.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.864
WHERE DO YOU
THINK THEY COME FROM?

21:37.964 --> 21:41.501
HERE'S WHERE THEY CAME FROM.
( mock sobbing )

21:41.601 --> 21:43.703
YOU'RE NOT CRYING.
THERE'S NO TEARS
COMING OUT.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.005
COME ON, WHAT'D YOU DO?
DID YOU SNEAK IN SOME
OF THAT GLYCERIN?

21:46.105 --> 21:48.575
NO, I'M SAYING IF IT MEANS
SOMETHING TO YOU, YOU CAN CRY.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.711
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M LOOKING AT YOUR EYES

21:51.811 --> 21:54.547
AND I SEE NO EVIDENCE AT ALL
THAT ANYBODY WAS CRYING.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.516
USUALLY WHEN SOMEONE
FINISHES CRYING

21:56.616 --> 21:58.918
THEY WIPE THE EVIDENCE
AWAY THERE WAS EVER A TEAR.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.753
AND DID YOU WIPE IT AWAY?

22:00.853 --> 22:02.955
YES I DID.
AND THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT

22:03.055 --> 22:04.190
IS IN THE BIN ON A TISSUE.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.459
- OH, IS THAT SO?
- CHECK IT OUT, COLUMBO.

22:06.559 --> 22:09.896
- ALL RIGHT, WE CAN GET GOING.
- WE CAN GET GOING?

22:09.996 --> 22:12.298
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
- GO ON.

22:12.399 --> 22:15.301
AT THE WILL-CALL WINDOW
I PICKED UP THE TICKET

22:15.402 --> 22:17.303
AND THEY CHARGED ME $200.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.871
YOU THOUGHT IT'D BE MORE?

22:18.971 --> 22:21.508
I THOUGHT-- YOU TOLD ME
YOU WERE GETTING ME A TICKET.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.710
- IT'S A SOLD-OUT SHOW.
- I DID GET YOU A TICKET.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.546
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THAT YOU WERE PICKING UP
THE TICKET,

22:26.646 --> 22:30.182
GIVEN THE FACT THAT I BOUGHT
YOU A BOTTLE OF WINE FOR $300.

22:30.282 --> 22:32.452
THAT WAS A GIFT--
THE GIFT OF WINE.

22:32.552 --> 22:35.622
THANK YOU.
AND I'VE GIVEN YOU
THE GIFT OF ART.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.757
WHETHER YOU GIVE ME A GIFT
OR I GIVE YOU A GIFT,

22:37.857 --> 22:39.426
IT COSTS ME MONEY.

22:39.526 --> 22:42.829
- OKAY, WELL...
- THANKS FOR COMING.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.432
- THANK YOU FOR
A MEANINGFUL EVENING.
- CHEERS. THANK YOU.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.437
JEFF, SUSIE.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.204
- OH, YOU WERE UNBELIEVABLE.
- HEY.

22:52.304 --> 22:53.906
- Jeff: JUST WONDERFUL.
- THANK YOU.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.876
YES, REALLY REALLY GOOD
UNDER VERY DIFFICULT
CIRCUMSTANCES.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.411
WHAT I ESPECIALLY
ENJOYED ABOUT IT--

22:58.511 --> 23:00.046
DO YOU KNOW WHAT, LARRY?

23:00.146 --> 23:02.314
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHAT YOU
ENJOYED ABOUT MY PERFORMANCE.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.751
BUT I REALLY DO GIVE A SHIT
WHAT YOU TALKED TO
MY HUSBAND ABOUT.

23:04.851 --> 23:08.287
THE OTHER NIGHT AT THE TABLE
YOU DECIDED TO TALK ABOUT
MY MARRIAGE.

23:08.387 --> 23:12.925
OH WELL, I WAS JUST REALLY
TRYING TO ELEVATE SMALL TALK
TO MEDIUM TALK.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.527
- THAT'S ALL I WAS DOING.
- WELL, DON'T.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.596
MY MARRIAGE IS MY BUSINESS.

23:16.696 --> 23:19.065
MY MARRIAGE IS FINE.
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

23:19.165 --> 23:22.969
AND ANOTHER THING,
I FUCK MY HUSBAND FOUR
OR FIVE TIMES A WEEK.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.604
FOUR OR FIVE TIMES
A FUCKING WEEK.

23:24.704 --> 23:27.474
SO SHOVE THAT UP YOUR ASS.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.411
Jeff:
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR COMING BACK.

23:32.512 --> 23:35.381
I'M THIS CLOSE TO SIGNING HIM.
THIS CLOSE.

23:35.482 --> 23:38.017
I THINK ONE MORE INTERACTION
I'M GOOD TO GO.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.286
- REALLY?
- I WAS LUCKY

23:40.386 --> 23:43.089
THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE
THAT IT WAS US

23:43.189 --> 23:45.525
- MAKING THE COMMOTION
AT THE THEATER LAST NIGHT.
- OH MY GOD.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.827
- COULD YOU IMAGINE?
- HAVE YOU GENTLEMEN DECIDED?

23:47.927 --> 23:50.296
OH.
HELLO.

23:50.396 --> 23:52.398
HOW'D YOU GET THIS SECTION?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOWN THERE.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.300
WELL, I'LL BE COVERING
THIS SECTION TODAY,

23:54.400 --> 23:56.035
UNLESS OF COURSE
YOU WANT TO HANDLE IT.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.805
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY I GOT UP
AND GOT THE FOOD THE OTHER DAY.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.773
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.842
YEAH?
THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.577
- OF COURSE.
- THERE YOU GO.

24:04.677 --> 24:05.912
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU TODAY?

24:06.012 --> 24:07.580
I'M GOING WITH
THE BISON BURGER.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.448
I'LL GET THE CHOPPED SALAD
WITH THE AVOCADO.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.350
OKAY.
THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.553
THANK YOU.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.956
- WHERE DID HE COME FROM?
- SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

24:17.056 --> 24:20.159
- JUST MATERIALIZES.
- AT VERY PRIVATE MOMENTS.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.094
- YES.
- THERE'S HANK.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.731
- HEY, HANK.
- HEY HANK, COME HERE
FOR A SECOND.

24:24.831 --> 24:27.233
COME HERE.
COME HERE.

24:27.333 --> 24:30.770
- HEY.
- I CAN'T-- I REALLY
CAN'T BE TALKING TO YOU.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.839
- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
- ( sighs )

24:32.939 --> 24:35.775
LISTEN, YOU OWE RICKY GERVAIS
$500 FOR THE SCARF, RIGHT?

24:35.875 --> 24:37.810
- YEAH.
- OKAY WELL, HE OWES ME $500.

24:37.910 --> 24:40.680
SO MY SUGGESTION IS WHY DON'T
YOU JUST GIVE ME THE $500

24:40.780 --> 24:42.448
AND EVERYBODY WILL BE EVEN.

24:42.549 --> 24:44.984
HEY, THERE HE IS.
RICKY.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.418
OH JEEZ.

24:46.519 --> 24:50.156
I OWE YOU $500,
LARRY SAYS YOU OWE HIM $500.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.559
SO HE WANTS ME TO GIVE
THE $500 TO HIM DIRECTLY.

24:52.659 --> 24:53.960
IS THAT COOL?

24:54.060 --> 24:56.095
( laughs )

24:56.195 --> 24:58.731
- NO GOOD?
- NOT REALLY.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.700
NEVER MIND THAT.
JUST ME THE $500.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.969
- NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM.
- I'M JUST GONNA GIVE HIM
THE MONEY.

25:03.069 --> 25:05.237
HE BOUGHT A BOTTLE
OF WINE FOR $300.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.439
NO, YOU BOUGHT ME A BOTTLE
OF WINE AND I GOT YOU
INTO THE THEATER.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.742
AND I PAID $200
FOR HIS TICKET--

25:09.842 --> 25:11.678
THAT I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO
GO THE PLAY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.279
THANK YOU.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

25:13.379 --> 25:15.347
- I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
- WHAT?

25:15.447 --> 25:18.918
I KNOW IT WAS YOU TWO
IDIOTS WHISPERING ALL
THE WAY THROUGH MY SHOW.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.953
- I WASN'T ANYWHERE NEAR HIM.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:21.053 --> 25:23.389
- WHERE DO YOU GET THAT FROM?
- THE WAITER.

25:23.489 --> 25:25.191
Jeff:
THE WAITER?

25:25.291 --> 25:27.894
AND YOU, I WOULDN'T LET
YOU REPRESENT ME NOW.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.328
FORGET IT.

25:29.428 --> 25:31.130
LOOK AT YOU THERE,
TWO IDIOTS.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.266
IT'S LIKE LAUREL AND HARDY.
DONNA WAS RIGHT.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.903
WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

25:37.003 --> 25:39.305
- NOTHING.
- YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO DONNA?

25:39.405 --> 25:41.207
- NO.
- NO, YOU JUST SAID
DONNA WAS RIGHT.

25:41.307 --> 25:45.411
- YEAH, SHE IS.
- SO YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
TO DONNA.

25:45.511 --> 25:47.013
NO.

25:47.113 --> 25:50.016
- HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING DONNA?
- NO.

25:50.116 --> 25:53.552
HUH.
ARE YOU SURE?

26:06.633 --> 26:08.200
OKAY.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.973
I'M REALLY UP
FOR THAT BISON BURGER.

26:14.073 --> 26:17.176
- GOOD CHOICE.
- HEY, THERE'S OUR FOOD.

26:24.817 --> 26:27.086
Ricky:
THE EVENING WAS ALL CHARMING
THE LAST TIME.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.055
OH YEAH.
( laughs )

26:29.155 --> 26:31.523
- YOU WERE TOO MUCH.
- I'M CHARMING, BUT--

26:31.624 --> 26:33.926
- Donna:
IT'S THE ENGLISH THING.
- YEAH YEAH.

26:34.026 --> 26:36.428
- IT'S THE ACCENT.
- EXACTLY, YEAH.

26:36.528 --> 26:39.198
NO NO NO.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.375
( laughing )

26:49.475 --> 26:51.377
( chatting )

26:58.017 --> 27:01.120
THIS IS MY FAVORITE
CARRIAGE HERE.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.627
( bell dings )

27:21.607 --> 27:22.975
Mugger:
GIVE ME YOUR MONEY.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.211
- Mugger: DON'T MOVE!
- Ricky: OKAY OKAY.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.714
- GIVE ME THAT RING!
GIVE ME THAT RING!
- Ricky: GIVE HIM THE RING.

27:27.814 --> 27:30.482
NOW! COME ON!
GIVE ME THAT!

27:30.582 --> 27:31.951
TAKE 'EM--
TAKE 'EM OFF!

27:32.051 --> 27:33.753
Donna:
JUST GIVE HIM YOUR SHOES.

27:33.853 --> 27:37.289
( shouting )
TAKE THEM OFF!

27:37.389 --> 27:40.126
- SHUT UP!
- OKAY, DON'T HIT ME
IN THE FACE THOUGH.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.331
( shouting )

27:46.966 --> 27:48.434
COME ON, FACE THE GROUND.

27:48.534 --> 27:49.668
GIVE IT TO ME.
TAKE IT OFF.

27:49.769 --> 27:52.538
GIVE ME THAT PURSE.
GIVE IT TO ME.

27:52.638 --> 27:55.174
AH!
( groaning )

27:56.743 --> 27:58.845
DROP IT!
DROP IT!

27:58.945 --> 28:00.346
- DROP IT!
- ( mugger grunts )

28:00.446 --> 28:02.148
MORE?

28:04.616 --> 28:07.887
THAT'S IT.
YEAH, GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.356
YEAH, I WAS JUST ABOUT--
WHOA.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.959
YEAH, WELL.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.027
I BELIEVE THIS BELONGS
TO YOU, YOUNG LADY.

28:15.127 --> 28:17.096
- MY GOD, LARRY.
- THERE YOU GO.

28:17.196 --> 28:20.466
- THANK YOU.
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

28:22.468 --> 28:24.470
$500.

28:24.570 --> 28:27.139
- THERE YOU GO.
- THANKS.

28:29.475 --> 28:30.977
SEE YOU AROUND.

28:32.979 --> 28:35.581
OH, AND YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THE BREAD, SIMMINGTON.

28:35.681 --> 28:36.749
IT IS HARD.

28:36.849 --> 28:39.485
( doors ding )

28:40.619 --> 28:43.422
HEY!
HEY!

28:44.456 --> 28:46.725
HEY!

28:46.826 --> 28:48.527
NO NO!
HEY! HEY!

28:48.627 --> 28:51.097
HEY!

28:51.197 --> 28:53.599
HEY!
HEY!

28:53.699 --> 28:55.868
( theme music playing )
