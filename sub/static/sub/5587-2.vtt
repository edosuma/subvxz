00:00.067 --> 00:03.535
ADULT ADAM: <i> Back in the day,</i>
<i> I was a ridiculously cute kid.</i>

00:03.537 --> 00:06.405
Yes! I am literally
the coolest man alive!

00:06.407 --> 00:08.273
<i> I'm not bragging.</i>
<i> It's just pure fact.</i>

00:08.275 --> 00:09.675
My God,
you're so cute!

00:09.677 --> 00:11.810
I just want to scrumple you up
and eat you whole!

00:11.812 --> 00:15.581
<i> But of course,</i>
<i> no one stays a kid forever.</i>

00:15.583 --> 00:17.349
Yeah.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.317
You sure about this?

00:18.319 --> 00:19.518
People are gonna know
I'm covering up a zit.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.489
Don't worry, pal.
I'll just tell everyone in
school I pummeled your face.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.791
You're a good brother.
The best.

00:25.793 --> 00:28.861
Here, you got a giant one
forming on your forehead, too.

00:28.863 --> 00:33.832
<i> Maybe I could hide</i>
<i> the pimples, but the rest</i>
<i> was hard to mask.</i>

00:33.834 --> 00:35.501
Let's go! Hustle!

00:35.503 --> 00:36.668
This is called scooter ball,

00:36.670 --> 00:39.538
not "sit in the corner
and talk to Kevin" ball.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.173
<i> I began to smell different.</i>

00:41.175 --> 00:43.375
Whoa, Goldfarb!

00:43.377 --> 00:44.843
Wheel it in!

00:45.312 --> 00:46.645
Time for a private huddle!

00:46.647 --> 00:48.881
I'm gonna put this
delicately, kid.

00:48.883 --> 00:51.083
You smell like
a gym sock's butt.

00:51.085 --> 00:51.683
Uh, thanks.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.318
You smell like
a garlic diaper.
Thanks?

00:53.320 --> 00:56.121
You smell like egg salad
left in a humidifier.
Thanks.

00:56.123 --> 01:00.225
I assume you don't notice
since you live
with that stink 24/7.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.226
Oh, no, I smell it.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.662
There's half a Speed Stick
in my desk.

01:03.664 --> 01:06.131
It's yours now.
Be liberal with it.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.099
Coach is
on your team here.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.667
That's why
I pulled you aside
to avoid embarrassment.

01:08.669 --> 01:13.639
I guess I wish you would have
pulled me aside
just a little farther.

01:14.208 --> 01:17.276
ADULT ADAM: <i> I was eating</i>
<i> like an animal</i>
<i> and suddenly seeing</i>

01:17.278 --> 01:19.411
<i> every woman I came across</i>
<i> in a new light.</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:23.415
You seen my, uh, TV guide
with Sally Jessy Raphael
on the cover?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.050
Mmm-mmm, nope.

01:25.052 --> 01:26.485
Hmm.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.788
<i> Every woman.</i>

01:29.790 --> 01:30.289
Man, oh, man.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.926
Those looks
and emotional intelligence
to boot?

01:33.928 --> 01:34.426
Whoa.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.963
<i> But worst of all,</i>
<i> it affected my favorite</i>
<i> activity in the world,</i>

01:37.965 --> 01:39.932
<i> the annual school musical.</i>

01:39.934 --> 01:40.966
Welcome, Mr. Goldberg.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.302
I have a feeling
that this might be
the year

01:43.304 --> 01:45.771
that you finally break out
of the chorus.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.673
(PIANO PLAYING)

01:47.675 --> 01:50.709
<i> ¶ I'm watching sis</i>
<i> go pitter pat</i>

01:50.711 --> 01:53.212
<i> ¶ Said, I can do that,</i>
<i> I can do that ¶</i>

01:53.214 --> 01:55.581
ADULT ADAM: <i> Turns out,</i>
<i> I could not do that.</i>

01:55.583 --> 01:59.284
(SIGHS)
Well, you, um...
You really...

01:59.286 --> 02:00.552
Really sang it.

02:00.554 --> 02:01.220
You sang it.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.655
I know in past years
I was upset when you put me
in the chorus.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.724
But I'm thinking this year,
it feels right.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.293
Done.
You're in the chorus.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.428
Oh, thank God.

02:09.430 --> 02:12.698
Chorus line,
which is a lead!

02:12.700 --> 02:13.866
But I'm in the chorus.

02:13.868 --> 02:15.033
Line.
Oh, thank God.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.236
Which means
you have a big solo.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.770
But I'm in the chorus.
Line.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.940
But did you not hear
the sounds I just made?

02:21.942 --> 02:25.344
Adam, every boy your age
sounds like you.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.613
And, honestly,
I don't have that much
to work with here,

02:27.615 --> 02:28.947
so I might as well
just give the leads

02:28.949 --> 02:30.415
to the most
enthusiastic kids.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.618
Balls.
Yeah, balls.

02:32.620 --> 02:36.555
Okay, uh,
let's take it from the top.
Sing it with me.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.958
BOTH:
<i> ¶ I'm watching sis go</i>
<i> pitter pat</i>

02:39.960 --> 02:40.626
Try to stay in the key.

02:40.628 --> 02:43.228
<i> ¶ I'm watching sis</i>
<i> go pitter pat</i>

02:43.230 --> 02:44.930
You're kind of all over
the map. Okay.

02:44.932 --> 02:47.799
<i> ¶ I'm watching sis</i>
<i> go pitter pat</i>

02:47.801 --> 02:48.500
<i> ¶ I can do that ¶</i>

02:48.502 --> 02:50.102
You know,
it's mostly a dance show,

02:50.104 --> 02:51.837
and you bring a lot
of dance energy.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.406
You'll get it.
Balls.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.641
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:55.643 --> 02:59.912
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say"</i>

03:02.249 --> 03:03.048
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

03:03.050 --> 03:07.252
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

03:07.922 --> 03:10.022
ADULT ADAM: <i> It was</i>
<i> September 30, 1980-something,</i>

03:10.024 --> 03:13.258
<i> and my brother</i>
<i> and his idiot posse, the JTP,</i>

03:13.260 --> 03:15.494
<i> were gearing up</i>
<i> for the homecoming dance.</i>

03:15.496 --> 03:16.495
What's happening?
What is this?

03:16.497 --> 03:19.131
Homecoming's in four days,
so it's time to give my boys

03:19.133 --> 03:21.366
a crash-course lesson
on how to groove
like Milli Vanilli.

03:21.368 --> 03:25.337
We all kind of told our dates
that we could dance,
so thank God for Barry.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.739
No.
Thank God for Milli.

03:27.741 --> 03:28.507
Vanilli, not so much.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.809
Wait, wait.
You choose Milli
over Vanilli?

03:30.811 --> 03:31.944
He's got the body
and the moves.

03:31.946 --> 03:34.780
Uh, if he's so great,
then why isn't it
Vanilli Milli?

03:34.782 --> 03:37.349
Milli proceeds Vanilli,
so suck it.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.350
You suck it.
You suck it.

03:38.352 --> 03:42.354
Wow, even you three boneheads
found a date to the dance.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.455
Kind of makes you think,
huh?

03:43.457 --> 03:45.190
Like maybe you need
a date for once?

03:45.192 --> 03:47.459
What are you talking about?
I date.
BARRY: No.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.560
You third-wheel
me and Lainey.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.662
Look, the only reason
why I haven't been on a date

03:50.664 --> 03:52.397
is because there's no one
at our school worth dating.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.566
Well, if you want to go
to homecoming with me,

03:54.568 --> 03:56.001
I'll totally drop
my foxy lady.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.069
Your foxy lady's
your cousin.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.471
Second-cousin.
Totally different
blood line.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.706
Probably not gonna
do stuff, though.

04:00.708 --> 04:01.740
She looks just like me
with a perm.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.943
Erica, you know I love you,
but you're kind of closed off
and way too picky.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.578
I mean, stay away from Geoff,
obviously,

04:06.580 --> 04:07.679
but you got to give
someone a chance.

04:07.681 --> 04:11.350
How is it my fault
that every guy in our school
is an unbearable moron?

04:11.352 --> 04:14.820
That's another thing.
You've got to stop calling
everyone a moron.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.189
Morons!
You're being too loud!

04:17.191 --> 04:19.591
Find another house
to stupid up.

04:19.593 --> 04:23.495
Oh. My. God.
You're just like dad!

04:23.497 --> 04:24.696
Way to go, Mur-man.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.765
Years of calling everyone
on the planet a moron

04:26.767 --> 04:30.035
has poisoned
your daughter's love life
and left her cold and alone.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.770
So you're telling me
that I've raised a daughter

04:31.772 --> 04:35.207
who doesn't want to date
dumbass high-school boys?

04:35.209 --> 04:36.708
I think
I've done my job.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.910
Come on.
Let us help you find someone.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.045
Go on.
Describe your perfect guy.

04:40.047 --> 04:43.548
Well, he'd be
a mysterious
handsome outsider

04:43.550 --> 04:44.716
with a trench coat,
a sexy voice,

04:44.718 --> 04:49.855
and a thriving acting career
where he plays the
thinking girl's heartthrob.

04:49.857 --> 04:53.325
Dude, you're just describing
Christian Slater.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.360
Seriously?
You're a lost cause.

04:55.362 --> 04:56.094
Well, you asked.

04:56.096 --> 04:59.131
Look, if a guy
like Christian Slater
walks through that door,

04:59.133 --> 05:01.767
I promise you I will go
with him to homecoming.

05:01.769 --> 05:02.601
Christian Slater, huh?

05:02.603 --> 05:05.370
You want the coolest guy
in the world?
You got him.

05:05.372 --> 05:06.938
What's that?

05:07.174 --> 05:10.008
Nothing,
I just farted. I...

05:10.010 --> 05:11.777
I farted.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.178
I fart... I gotta go.

05:13.180 --> 05:17.416
ADULT ADAM: <i> While Geoff</i>
<i> was hatching a plan,</i>
<i> I was out of options.</i>

05:17.418 --> 05:19.985
(GASPS)
There's my
tiny snuggle angel.

05:19.987 --> 05:24.289
Stop it!
I'm not tiny
or snuggly or angel-y.

05:24.291 --> 05:25.590
Tough day
at the office, kiddo?

05:25.592 --> 05:28.026
The worst.
I got the lead
in the musical.

05:28.028 --> 05:31.663
Schmoo, that's fantastic.
That's all
you've ever wanted.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.998
Not anymore.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.300
My face is breaking out,
my pits are stinking,

05:35.302 --> 05:39.237
and my voice is very,
very unpredictable.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.173
I finally get
the part of a lifetime,

05:41.175 --> 05:43.008
and I'm gonna just
humiliate myself.

05:43.010 --> 05:46.545
Ah, yes, the wondrous journey
through puberty.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.213
It's not wondrous.
It's awful.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.649
Well, you've come
to the right place.

05:50.651 --> 05:51.249
Oh, no.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.518
It's my duty
to help you out,
baby bro.

05:53.520 --> 05:58.924
Only Big Tasty can guide
you through what many call
"the pubening."

05:58.926 --> 06:00.158
No one calls it that.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.093
First,
stop washing your face.

06:01.095 --> 06:04.429
You'll go through
a very shiny,
greasy couple of months.

06:04.431 --> 06:06.965
But eventually,
your natural oils reach
a healthy balance.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.066
Why does he do this?
I don't know.

06:08.068 --> 06:11.703
Second, always shave dry
and against the grain,

06:11.705 --> 06:15.474
attacking the follicles
in a jerky, zig-zag pattern.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.175
And third,
never use deodorant.

06:17.177 --> 06:20.512
That's just something
that big corporations
made up to take your money.

06:20.514 --> 06:24.216
Simply apply
a healthy layer
of Vaseline to the armpit

06:24.218 --> 06:25.417
and let it seal in
the stink.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.551
He's still going.
He means well.

06:26.553 --> 06:31.022
Think of me as a resource.
I'm here for you, bro.

06:31.425 --> 06:34.926
Thank you, boopie.
So helpful.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.361
Forget everything
you just heard.

06:36.363 --> 06:38.764
If anyone understands
what you're going through,
it's mama.

06:38.766 --> 06:42.934
No offense, Mom,
but you have no idea
how hard this is for me.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.870
Please, I've watched
two children

06:44.872 --> 06:46.605
go through the pubening.
(CHUCKLES)

06:46.607 --> 06:50.342
Heck, I even
went through it myself
at the tender age of 9.

06:50.344 --> 06:51.209
It wasn't ideal.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.644
They used
to call me "Booberly."

06:52.646 --> 06:54.746
But this is
just something all of us

06:54.748 --> 06:57.149
had to suffer through
on our own.

06:57.151 --> 06:57.949
Now you will, too.

06:57.951 --> 07:02.254
Or completely
skip over.

07:02.256 --> 07:02.587
Hmm?

07:02.589 --> 07:05.424
With my guidance,
I'll take this
horrible time

07:05.426 --> 07:08.226
and make it smooth, easy,
and maybe a little bit fun.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.196
Are you actually saying
you could save me
from puberty?

07:11.198 --> 07:11.930
No! She can't.

07:11.932 --> 07:15.333
Yes, that is exactly
what I'm saying.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.803
At this point,
I got nothing to lose.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.737
Show me
what you got, lady.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.539
ADULT ADAM: <i> While I put</i>
<i> my faith in my mother,</i>

07:20.541 --> 07:24.176
<i> Geoff Schwartz</i>
<i> put his in Christian Slater.</i>

07:24.178 --> 07:26.511
Greetings and salutations.

07:26.513 --> 07:27.279
Lovely home
you got here.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.015
What's going on?
Why are you talking
like a jackass?

07:30.017 --> 07:33.118
Erica said she wanted
a Christian Slater,
so here I am.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.987
I know it's a long shot,
but I just think
your daughter's amazing.

07:35.989 --> 07:39.858
And if you approve,
I'd love to take her
to homecoming.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.159
Erica!

07:41.161 --> 07:42.794
You've got
a gentleman suitor.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.330
You're one
of the good ones, Mr. G.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.666
ERICA: A gentleman what?
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

07:49.269 --> 07:51.236
Greetings and salutations.

07:51.238 --> 07:55.507
I was just skateboarding by,
gleaming the cube and whatnot.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.575
Thought we could go
grab a slushie.

07:56.577 --> 08:00.445
Oh, my God, are you trying
to impress me by acting
like Christian slater?

08:00.447 --> 08:02.147
Is it working?
No.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.281
And your clip-on earring
just popped off.

08:03.283 --> 08:06.685
Okay, look, I, I just...
I think you're great,
okay?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.353
I have since, like,
second grade.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.188
Now, I know I made promises
to my cousin,

08:10.190 --> 08:13.191
but maybe we could go
to homecoming together?

08:13.193 --> 08:14.659
Oh, Geoff,
this was sweet,

08:14.661 --> 08:16.828
but I have a pretty firm
"no moron" policy.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.430
Question,
am I in that category?
For sure.

08:18.432 --> 08:23.401
Uh, so, um... Okay,

for a "maybe."

08:32.813 --> 08:36.181

08:36.817 --> 08:38.416
Wow, who knew
so many interesting

08:38.418 --> 08:41.786
and attractive young men
went to this school?

08:41.788 --> 08:42.487
They're okay, I guess.

08:42.489 --> 08:45.423
Yeah, lots of fellas who look
like they'd be worth
getting to know.

08:45.425 --> 08:46.391
I should put myself
out there more.

08:46.393 --> 08:50.896
Oh, look at that one
with the stylish scarf
and the sketchbook...

08:50.898 --> 08:52.597
A poet and an artist,
I bet.

08:52.599 --> 08:53.431
That's Dan.
(CHUCKLES)

08:53.433 --> 08:56.134
He's shy, but I think
I could crack open that nut.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.802
Hey, how about
that hot shot?

08:57.804 --> 09:00.105
Is he a swimmer?
He's built like a swimmer.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.706
Look at those shoulders.
He swims, for sure.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.743
Will you shut up?
I'm not even talking
to you.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.678
Well, I certainly hope
you're not talking to me.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.614
Hey, take it from someone
who doesn't like people.

09:09.616 --> 09:13.285

you're gonna
miss out on a lot.

09:13.287 --> 09:15.587

to date more?

09:15.589 --> 09:16.321
It's homecoming!

09:16.323 --> 09:19.491
There's got to be
a nice guy somewhere
who deserves a chance.

09:19.493 --> 09:19.991
You're right!

09:19.993 --> 09:22.027
I'm gonna go ask Dan
to sit with me at lunch,

09:22.029 --> 09:24.095
see what makes
that guy tick.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.630

Thanks, Dad.

09:25.632 --> 09:26.731
Yes, this is amazing!

09:26.733 --> 09:29.534
Your dad actually
provided you
with real wisdom for once.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.102
Chill, I didn't say
I was going to the dance.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.738
I just said
I would consider it
if an idiot asked me.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.508
Got it.
We'll play it cool
and casually spread the word.

09:36.510 --> 09:39.411
Attention, entire school!

09:39.413 --> 09:40.712
This is Erica Goldberg,

09:40.714 --> 09:44.249
and she will go
to homecoming
with anyone willing to ask.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.817
Barry, sit your ass down
right now.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.886
Uh, to clarify,
she's not a desperate loser.

09:47.888 --> 09:51.756
She's just super closed-off,
and the door's open a crack.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.726
Which reminds me, Dan,
we're hanging out
after school.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.361
I, I have a dentist
appointment, bro.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.464
Cancel it!
We're building
something here!

10:00.067 --> 10:01.499
Get down.

10:01.501 --> 10:02.200
Subtle. Thank you.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.769

now we can just
sit back and wait.

I really appreciate you

12:48.034 --> 12:49.100
agreeing to see me
on such short notice.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.804
Technically, I didn't agree.
You just barged in
during third period

12:52.806 --> 12:53.605
and yelled
"class dismissed."

12:53.607 --> 12:57.809
Point is, I understand
you're putting together a cast
for this year's musical,

12:57.811 --> 13:00.512
and it's presented
some challenges.

13:00.514 --> 13:03.047
It's a real suck show.
Uh, you're gonna be great.

I won't be,
but that's sweet to say.

through this in the past.

You can't be
in the musical.

13:14.060 --> 13:17.095
No, no, I...
I've come to accept that.

13:17.097 --> 13:20.031

approach entirely.

could do the same thing

13:28.708 --> 13:31.042
only without making
the same sloppy mistakes?

13:31.044 --> 13:35.280
Are you actually suggesting
that Adam lip-sync his songs
in the show?

out loud, it really does sound
insane, even for me.

Mom, it's fine.

17:23.476 --> 17:27.512
This recording is gonna blow
the freaking roof
off this place.

17:27.514 --> 17:32.016
And so are you
with your own voices.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.285
Yes, they are creaking
and cracking.

17:34.287 --> 17:37.989
And, yes, your foreheads
are very shiny, all right?

17:37.991 --> 17:40.825
And you take
insanely long showers,

17:40.827 --> 17:41.793
but it doesn't matter

17:41.795 --> 17:45.830
because you're all just
as amazing as you always were.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.665
I don't feel amazing.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.233
You?
What's your problem?

17:49.235 --> 17:52.270
Oh, you heard my voice.
Who cares?

17:52.272 --> 17:54.739
I got bacne, dude.
Crazy bacne.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.041
So? I sweat constantly
for no reason.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.911
I-I'm sweating right now,
and it's like
50 degrees in here.

17:59.913 --> 18:03.281
I've got a weird thing
for Sally Jessy Raphael.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.649
BEVERLY: See?

18:04.651 --> 18:05.583
None of you are alone.

18:05.585 --> 18:10.488
You're all going through
something that everybody
has to suffer through.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.990
Come on.
Who's with me?

18:12.992 --> 18:13.925
Screw it.

18:13.927 --> 18:14.992
Let's go out there
and give them

18:14.994 --> 18:19.530
the best worst musical
the school has ever seen.

18:20.033 --> 18:21.799
ADULT ADAM: <i> And so we sang it.</i>

18:21.801 --> 18:22.800
<i> We really sang it.</i>

18:22.802 --> 18:27.038
<i> And it wasn't pretty,</i>
<i> but it was definitely us.</i>

18:27.107 --> 18:31.442
<i> ¶ Kiss today goodbye</i>

18:34.114 --> 18:39.016
<i> ¶ The sweetness</i>
<i> and the sorrow</i>

18:41.988 --> 18:43.988
ALL:
<i> ¶ Wish me luck</i>

18:43.990 --> 18:45.723
<i> ¶ The same</i>

18:45.725 --> 18:49.393
<i> ¶ To you</i>

18:52.932 --> 18:55.900
<i> Sure, growing up is hard</i>
<i> and awkward and embarrassing.</i>

18:55.902 --> 18:58.903
<i> But if you're lucky,</i>
<i> you just mind find</i>
<i> the courage</i>

18:58.905 --> 19:01.339
<i> to sing</i>
<i> your way through it...</i>

19:01.574 --> 19:05.977
<i> ¶ What I did for love ¶</i>

19:09.115 --> 19:13.417
<i> ...or have someone</i>
<i> talk you through it</i>
<i> when you least expect it.</i>

19:13.419 --> 19:15.386
Hey, peanut.

19:15.622 --> 19:18.489
I, uh, heard
about the kid
with the hair.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.526
So, uh, you're not going
to the dance, huh?

19:21.528 --> 19:23.494
Honestly,
I hate dances.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.562
And the nice thing
about being alone

19:24.564 --> 19:28.399
is that there's
no one here bothering me,
acting like a moron.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.569
Oh, my God,
Barry's right.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.871
God, I'm just like you.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.306
Sorry.

19:35.608 --> 19:36.841
I get it.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.177
But there's hope.
Why?

19:39.179 --> 19:41.579
Well, things work out.

19:41.581 --> 19:42.380
I met your mom.

19:42.382 --> 19:46.751
She sees the best
in everybody,
even a grump like me.

19:46.819 --> 19:49.120
All I'm saying is

19:49.522 --> 19:51.989
just give people
a chance.

19:52.926 --> 19:54.825
Don't be a moron.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.696
ADULT ADAM: <i> 'Cause as hard</i>
<i> as it is to grow up,</i>

19:58.698 --> 20:01.098
<i> it's even harder</i>
<i> to go through it alone.</i>

20:01.668 --> 20:04.202
<i> And when you open up</i>
<i> and put yourself out there,</i>

20:04.204 --> 20:06.871
<i> you'll be surprised</i>
<i> where it leads.</i>

20:06.873 --> 20:08.472
Erica, hi!

20:08.474 --> 20:10.942
Greetings and salutations.

20:11.010 --> 20:11.442
You busy?

20:11.444 --> 20:14.679
Uh, not really.
I was just waiting
for my cousin to call back.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.415
I thought maybe
we could still make
the end of the dance.

20:17.417 --> 20:21.452
Well, I was thinking maybe
we could hang out instead.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.320
No way.
As friends.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.388
Yeah, no.
Let's not put
a label on it.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.990
Let's... Mmm-hmm.

20:25.992 --> 20:29.827
So, what do you say
we go grab a slushie?

20:30.630 --> 20:32.063
(CHUCKLES)

20:32.532 --> 20:34.131
Mmm, check this out.

20:34.133 --> 20:34.765
Gleaming the cube.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.635
What does that even mean?
No one knows.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.371
(GRUNTS)
(LAUGHS)

20:40.373 --> 20:43.541
Oh, my God,
Geoff, are you okay?

20:43.943 --> 20:47.445
No, not a new one.
It's photo day at school.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.379
You came
to the right place.

20:48.381 --> 20:51.082
No, get out!
I don't want any
of your terrible advice.

20:51.084 --> 20:55.052
Dude, I'm a pimple pro.
You got to pop
that thing immediately.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.255
Everyone says
not to pop it.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.523
Look at this
flawless skin.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.459
It's like
baby Italian marble.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.962
Would you rather have
a pizza face
or a Barry face?

21:04.964 --> 21:06.931
Fine.
I'll just pop the thing.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.867
Oh, I gotta get this
on film.

21:10.637 --> 21:11.369
Come on.

21:11.371 --> 21:12.937
Let's get a close-up
of that zit.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.573
Hey, why are you covering it?
Don't feel
so embarrassed.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.942
Let me see that zit.
Come on.
For memories.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.378
BARRY: Let's get a close-up
of that zit.

21:20.380 --> 21:24.949
He's covering his mouth
'cause he doesn't want anyone
to see his zit.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.752
(LAUGHS)
(BELL DINGS)
