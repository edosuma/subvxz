I can help you find answers.

00:07.442 --> 00:09.052
We can make ourselves immune.

Why don't you take this back
to Chad and the rest.

Ha!

00:16.668 --> 00:17.539
Who is she?

00:17.582 --> 00:19.280
My daughter, Violet.

Yah!

00:20.716 --> 00:21.760

00:21.804 --> 00:23.414

to kill a daywalker.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.804

next time.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.723

03:21.766 --> 03:24.552

03:24.595 --> 03:28.033
But there's nothing out there
but vampires and assholes.

03:28.077 --> 03:30.210

03:33.125 --> 03:34.214
Okay, look.

need you.

03:35.432 --> 03:37.521

03:37.565 --> 03:43.179
So just stay
and help us out.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.442
Look, I'm sorry.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.575
I- I can't keep doing that.

03:47.618 --> 03:48.837
Doing what?

03:48.880 --> 03:51.143
Killing.

03:51.187 --> 03:54.538
Because there's
another option?

03:54.582 --> 03:56.148
Look, it's almost sundown.

03:56.192 --> 03:58.325
Uh... stay the night.

03:58.368 --> 03:59.935
Or at least let us give you
something to eat.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.458
Thanks, but I don't need it.

04:01.502 --> 04:02.938
But you can't go.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.809
It's uh, it's karaoke night.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.028

down now?

04:42.543 --> 04:43.631

04:43.674 --> 04:44.980
No hesitation.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.198
Get up.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.809
Is there a point
to all of this?

04:47.852 --> 04:49.114
The training?

04:49.158 --> 04:50.290
You?

04:50.333 --> 04:51.769
What about me?

04:51.813 --> 04:53.989
Well, it's not like you're here
on your own free will.

04:54.032 --> 04:56.383
It's better than
the alternative.

04:56.426 --> 04:57.645
Is it?

04:57.688 --> 04:59.299
I mean, I'm trapped here, too.

04:59.342 --> 05:01.126
All the action is out there
beyond the guards

05:01.170 --> 05:02.650
and the barbed wire.

05:02.693 --> 05:06.349
Yeah, well there's nothing wrong
with being safe.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.785
Plus your dad,
he just probably-

05:07.829 --> 05:11.180
Can we not talk about him
right now?

05:13.400 --> 05:15.097
Fine.

05:18.405 --> 05:21.059
Tell me about this place.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.757

05:22.800 --> 05:25.368
This is one of the last
remaining outposts.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.196
We've been here

05:28.153 --> 05:29.329
What?

05:29.372 --> 05:31.113
All this training?

05:31.156 --> 05:32.897
It's not for
the outside world.

05:32.941 --> 05:35.073
They're teaching you
the wrong stuff.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.466
Really?

05:36.510 --> 05:37.728
Listen, kid.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.469
You got some skills,
and I'll give you that.

05:39.513 --> 05:41.819
But they're schooling you
to fight humans.

05:41.863 --> 05:43.081
The real enemy?

05:43.125 --> 05:44.431
Vampires.

05:44.474 --> 05:47.825
And they do not fight
like us.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.479
Oh yeah?

05:52.134 --> 05:54.484
Then show me.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.360

06:19.988 --> 06:21.555
Vampires are tactical.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.339
They only want your blood.

You're dead.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.615
Daywalkers heal.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.181
You come face to face
with a daywalker

07:23.225 --> 07:25.314
you do not hesitate!

07:25.357 --> 07:27.577

about getting out of here.

Maybe I know more
than you realize.

07:50.426 --> 07:53.908
I'm not a prisoner,

and I'll show you.

about you right now.

You know I don't like needles.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.813
Do you want a four-day
hangover or not?

08:29.857 --> 08:31.554

that leave you like this.

Okay, okay. Can you- can we just
count down from three?

08:35.558 --> 08:36.341

Your body heals alright,
but your nerve endings,

08:52.314 --> 08:55.839
your pain receptors,
are still heightened.

08:55.883 --> 08:59.060
Remember that the next time you
try taking on the whole world.

08:59.103 --> 09:02.106
Well, it wasn't the whole world,
it was just one girl.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.108
And she did this to you?

I like her already.

09:08.591 --> 09:11.246
Look, I don't get why
you're helping Hansen.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.465
He's not wrong.

09:13.509 --> 09:16.860
The guy just loves making
people suffer.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.862
He's a silver-haired asshole,

09:18.906 --> 09:21.299
but Avery, she's after
the same thing we are

09:21.343 --> 09:24.868
so I figure if I can help her
maybe she'll help us.

09:24.912 --> 09:27.610
Are you sure about that?

09:27.654 --> 09:29.438
The answer's in the blood.

09:29.481 --> 09:31.875
What Vanessa has,
what you've got.

09:31.919 --> 09:34.704
The DNA sequence I ran on
that blood from the necklace.

09:34.748 --> 09:40.928
The genome was less than a tenth
of a percent off human.

09:40.971 --> 09:43.408
Look, I flunked seventh grade
in 1903, Doc.

09:43.452 --> 09:44.496
You gotta help me out here.

09:44.540 --> 09:45.672
Right. Right.

09:46.890 --> 09:51.895
Um... Mmm... okay...

09:51.939 --> 09:55.333
Okay, we have the blood
from the necklace

09:55.377 --> 09:57.118
and we have Vanessa's blood.

09:57.161 --> 10:02.993
The two are virtually identical
except something has changed.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.081
Mutated, if you will.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.735
And I don't know why.

10:05.779 --> 10:08.085
But if I can figure that out
we can use that goodwill

10:08.129 --> 10:11.001
to get Jolene and Flesh
out of that prison.

10:11.045 --> 10:13.787
Well, that's great, but what
do we do in the meantime?

10:13.830 --> 10:15.223
In the meantime?

10:15.266 --> 10:18.574
We play along with Hansen,
I cozy up to Avery,

10:18.618 --> 10:21.533

of this chicken coop.
