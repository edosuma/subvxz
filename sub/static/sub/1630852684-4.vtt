This must be

It's a portrait.
You had to sit for that!

Fine. I admit it.

In certain situations, yes,
having a code isn't the worst idea,

as long as you can break it
when it suits you.

pretty badass,

call myself "Horse Cock."

I know she's
the only human you trust,

She probably won't even notice.

when she starts throwing stuff
