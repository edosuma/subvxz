00:04.471 --> 00:06.200
Thank you, Geoffrey.

00:06.272 --> 00:08.433
- Mom.
- It's only a weekend.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.567
Besides, at your age,
you should be able to...

00:10.643 --> 00:12.474
baby-sit your little sister.

00:14.547 --> 00:16.139
Why can't Geoffrey baby-sit her?

00:16.216 --> 00:18.878
Because we're giving him the weekend off.

00:19.052 --> 00:22.180
You mean I'm going to have to
get my own breakfast, too?

00:23.323 --> 00:26.019
Am I being punished for something?

00:26.092 --> 00:28.617
I was just asking myself
that same question.

00:29.629 --> 00:31.460
But, Dad, I'm only nine.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.658
Can't Hilary take care of herself?

00:35.568 --> 00:36.967
Hi, Hilary.

00:38.505 --> 00:41.497
Ashley, you be a good girl
while we're in Palm Springs.

00:41.574 --> 00:45.135
Well, I'm in a bad mood,
and somebody is going to suffer.

00:46.179 --> 00:48.170
Please take me with you.

00:49.849 --> 00:52.010
If I could, sweetie,
I'd put you in my pocket...

00:52.085 --> 00:55.486
but this retreat is just for members
of the law firm and their spouses.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.681
No kids allowed.

00:56.756 --> 00:59.020
Man, this is going to be hype.

01:00.860 --> 01:05.126
Yo, Palm Springs,
the home of the dental floss bikini.

01:06.966 --> 01:09.764
Will, before you get your mojo working...

01:11.037 --> 01:13.062
I think there's something
you should know:

01:13.139 --> 01:14.265
You're not going.

01:14.340 --> 01:18.003
You better tell that to my mojo
because his bags is packed.

01:19.646 --> 01:22.615
That's Henry and Margaret.
Geoffrey, would you get that, please?

01:22.682 --> 01:26.948
Right away, sir.
I shall tend to my hernia a bit later.

01:30.957 --> 01:34.051
Uncle Phil, I don't think
you want to leave me here all weekend...

01:34.127 --> 01:35.617
with no adult supervision.

01:35.695 --> 01:38.129
<i>Did you see that movie House Party?</i>

01:39.299 --> 01:41.767
<i>No. Did you see The Terminator?</i>

01:43.536 --> 01:45.766
Mr. And Mrs. Furth.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.831
Kids, the limo's waiting.
We'll drive right to the helicopter.

01:48.908 --> 01:51.502
- Helicopter?
- I just got my license.

01:53.313 --> 01:54.678
My man, Henry.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.472
Wouldn't it be nice...

01:56.549 --> 01:59.382
if you could have your car
with you in Palm Springs?

01:59.452 --> 02:01.977
What if you could find
a nice, responsible young man...

02:02.055 --> 02:03.283
to drive it there for you?

02:03.356 --> 02:05.586
Will, that's a super idea.

02:05.825 --> 02:08.589
Carlton, you're a nice, responsible
young man.

02:08.661 --> 02:10.856
And you're an eminent,
respected attorney...

02:10.930 --> 02:13.455
and your wife is a dazzling beauty.

02:14.934 --> 02:16.094
Yo, G.

02:16.169 --> 02:19.935
Did you leave a vacuum cleaner on?
I just heard a loud sucking noise.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.503
Carlton, old sport...

02:24.577 --> 02:27.569
would you like to drive my Mercedes
to Palm Springs this weekend?

02:27.647 --> 02:30.047
You could hang around the retreat,
play some golf...

02:30.116 --> 02:33.813
You know, the chicks in Palm Springs
wear the skimpiest of bikinis.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.617
I sure could use a good game of golf.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.325
Good show. See you there.

02:40.393 --> 02:44.022
Okay, everybody.
Last one in the chopper is a rotten egg.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.227
- See you, kiddo.
- Be good.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.662
Okay. Take care.

02:48.735 --> 02:51.260
- See you, Dad. Have a good trip.
- Okay, son.

02:53.239 --> 02:55.207
Why so glum, chum?

02:56.609 --> 03:00.067
It was my idea for me to drive
his car to Palm Springs.

03:00.146 --> 03:02.478
How come he asked you to do it?

03:03.082 --> 03:05.107
This is a Black thing, isn't it?

One: Work on golf swing.

04:36.976 --> 04:39.740
Two: Review SAT practice book.

04:40.079 --> 04:43.640
Three: Ask Mr. Furth
about a summer internship.

04:43.716 --> 04:45.980
Four: Get the stick out of your butt!

04:52.558 --> 04:55.686
Way to go, Will.
You almost made us crash.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.953
What do you think
you're doing here anyway?

04:58.031 --> 05:01.262
Come on, just relax.
Pretend I'm not even here.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.426
Gladly.

05:04.604 --> 05:06.003
What you eating?

05:06.806 --> 05:08.501
For crying out loud.

05:08.574 --> 05:10.041
Can I have some?

05:11.344 --> 05:12.504
All right, Will.

05:12.578 --> 05:14.978
I'll share my snack with you
on one condition.

05:15.048 --> 05:18.313
When we get to Palm Springs,
you'll behave like a proper gentleman...

05:18.384 --> 05:21.319
and try to maintain
some sense of decorum and etiquette.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.548
- Understood?
- Yeah.

05:23.623 --> 05:26.353
Good. What do you say to an Oreo?

05:26.426 --> 05:28.394
I say, "What's up, Carlton?"

05:35.868 --> 05:37.631
I can't believe we're lost.

05:37.704 --> 05:40.969
What's the name of this street?
"Arguello Drive."

05:41.040 --> 05:43.031
Maybe that'll get us back to the freeway.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.872
Here, let me check.

05:46.646 --> 05:50.377
No, man. No freeways.
Carlton, look out! A low bridge!

05:54.887 --> 05:56.821
Look, thanks a lot, man.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.888
Now we got to go back and get my head!

06:00.693 --> 06:02.490
And I really liked that head.

06:04.063 --> 06:05.690
Can the yuck fest, Will.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.630
We're lost. And it's all your fault.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.190
You the one who ain't bring no map.

06:09.268 --> 06:13.227
- You had to go to the bathroom.
- You're the one that gave me that Shasta.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.375
- Is that the police?
- Punch it, man. We're in a Benz.

06:19.445 --> 06:22.312
Are you crazy? I call this a lucky break.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.715
A policeman is our pal.
We can ask him for directions.

06:28.621 --> 06:31.988
Listen to me, when he comes up,
keep your hands on the wheel.

06:33.092 --> 06:36.858
- Good evening, Officer. Carlton Banks.
- Keep your hands on the wheel.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.890
- Where are you headed?
- We're going to Palm Springs. And you?

06:41.968 --> 06:44.334
Where are you headed this fine evening?

06:45.071 --> 06:47.266
Good job.
Now he's gonna want to see your license.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.364
Right.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.432
Can I see your license?

06:50.510 --> 06:52.978
My license? I have to warn you...

06:53.045 --> 06:55.536
this picture was taken
without my contacts.

06:55.615 --> 06:58.516
And the height is a typo,
I'm actually a lot taller.

06:59.318 --> 07:01.616
<i>Fool, this is not The Love Connection.</i>

07:03.055 --> 07:05.853
- Vehicle registration, please.
- Just a sec.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.553
But the thing is, Officer, this isn't my car.

07:11.063 --> 07:13.395
- Get out of the car.
- What?

07:13.466 --> 07:15.400
He's going to tell us to get out of the car.

07:15.468 --> 07:18.301
- You watch too much TV.
- Get out of the car.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.565
Officer, honestly, I don't see the need to...

07:22.642 --> 07:25.304
Hey, out of the car now.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.354
Hey, Carlton.

07:38.424 --> 07:41.552
Thanks to you we're already
an hour late to bikini land.

07:43.429 --> 07:46.523
So when they interrogate us,
which they like to do...

07:46.599 --> 07:49.193
keep all your answers short and sweet.

07:49.268 --> 07:52.101
Will, I know how to handle this.
I'm pre-law.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.372
Okay, fellas, let's start at the beginning.

07:57.443 --> 07:58.774
- Where are you from?
- LA.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.336
- Not exactly...
- Next question, please.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.376
Let's hear what your friend has to say.

08:06.452 --> 08:08.249
Actually we come from Bel-Air.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.653
In fact, we live two houses
away from the Reagans.

08:10.723 --> 08:12.554
We have the same pool man.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.386
And where were you headed to?

08:17.463 --> 08:20.899
- The desert. Next question, please.
- Not just the desert.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.697
Palm Springs.

08:22.768 --> 08:25.669
We're going to a legal retreat
at Henry Furth's villa.

08:25.738 --> 08:28.707
He's my father's partner
and the owner of the car we're driving.

08:28.774 --> 08:29.900
He is, is he?

08:29.976 --> 08:32.443
Then why didn't he drive it himself
to Palm Springs?

08:32.511 --> 08:35.345
Because his wife flew everybody
in her helicopter.

08:38.518 --> 08:42.852
Okay, fellas, we've had a lot of car thefts
in the area lately.

08:42.922 --> 08:46.153
- You want to talk about it?
- Okay, I think it's terrible.

08:48.494 --> 08:50.223
You making fun of me, kid?

08:50.296 --> 08:52.787
You're the one
who wanted to talk about it.

08:53.099 --> 08:56.398
Quite frankly, I think it's a matter
for the police to handle.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.733
Carlton, they're handling it now.

09:01.173 --> 09:03.471
What on earth are you talking about?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.306
They think we stole the Benz.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.404
Officers, let me call Henry Furth.
He's the owner of the car.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.278
He'll straighten everything out.

09:10.349 --> 09:12.647
Sure. And while you're at it...

09:12.718 --> 09:15.846
you might want to give Ron and Nancy
a ring-a-ding-ding.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.917
Come on. It is up! It's up!

09:20.226 --> 09:21.215
Yes!

09:22.228 --> 09:24.890
You bum. You miserable bum!

09:25.698 --> 09:27.097
What a great game.

09:28.834 --> 09:30.699
Would you get that, honey?

09:33.472 --> 09:36.066
- Hello?
- May I speak to Philip Banks?

09:36.742 --> 09:38.676
Thanks? For what?

09:39.712 --> 09:42.237
No, I said, "Philip Banks."
Can I speak to him?

09:42.315 --> 09:45.113
I don't see him. He must have stepped out.

09:45.184 --> 09:46.651
Can you call back later?

09:46.719 --> 09:48.687
No. Is Mr. Furth there?

09:48.754 --> 09:50.688
Yes. This is Mrs. Furth.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.687
Mrs. Furth, this is Carlton Banks.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.888
Carlton, how are you, dear?

09:56.963 --> 10:01.263
You've got to get a message to my father.
It's very important. I'm in jail.

10:01.367 --> 10:04.131
Yale? Marvelous.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.967
I've got to go now. See you soon, dear.

10:09.041 --> 10:12.340
Philip, Vivian, Carlton just called.

10:12.411 --> 10:15.141
- Is everything all right?
- I should say so.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.011
He got into Yale.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.017
Yale? That's my alma mater.

10:22.254 --> 10:25.087
Carlton's only a sophomore.
He's not applying to college yet.

10:25.157 --> 10:27.318
You know Margaret.
I'm sure she got it wrong.

10:27.393 --> 10:31.227
It probably wasn't Yale or Carlton.
It probably wasn't even the phone.

10:32.932 --> 10:35.901
I'm not getting back in that helicopter
with her.

10:36.602 --> 10:39.730
It's all right, man. Chill.
I get a phone call, too.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.534
C, it's all right. Chill.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.043
Get it.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.951
SHE

10:56.355 --> 10:58.823
Hilary, you're sitting
right next to the phone.

10:58.891 --> 11:01.826
I don't care. I'm your babysitter.
I command you.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.125
Phone.

11:11.137 --> 11:13.298
Let me know if it's for me.

11:13.372 --> 11:15.670
But, Miss Hilary, I'm off duty.

11:15.741 --> 11:18.437
And you're sitting right next to the phone.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.638
Yeah, but you're facing the phone.

11:24.717 --> 11:25.843
Lazy House.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.085
G, what up?

11:30.156 --> 11:32.716
This is Will, man. I need a big favor.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.659
I'm tired of doing favors
for you spoilt children.

11:35.728 --> 11:38.720
I'm off duty. I am not an animal.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.699
Yo, man.

11:46.305 --> 11:49.172
I need another phone call.
My butler hung up on me.

11:53.112 --> 11:56.548
Okay, fellas. You want to talk about
those other car thefts?

11:56.615 --> 11:58.913
I don't think you know
who you're talking to.

11:58.984 --> 12:01.612
I have a 3.95 grade point average...

12:01.687 --> 12:05.088
which would have been 4.0,
except I had to take a ceramics class...

12:05.157 --> 12:07.489
and my pot exploded in my kiln.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.393
I'm going to go to Harvard Law School,
graduate with honors...

12:10.463 --> 12:12.260
and then I'm going to sue you blind.

12:12.331 --> 12:14.356
Now give us another phone call.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.280
I think he likes you.

12:40.192 --> 12:42.717
This is terrible. I'm ruined.

12:43.129 --> 12:46.292
I'll be kicked out of the glee club,
I won't get into Princeton.

12:46.365 --> 12:48.162
I won't be admitted to the bar.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.668
Neither will I. The cops took my fake ID.

12:53.472 --> 12:56.441
Come on, man, don't give me
that my-dog-is-dead face.

12:57.042 --> 13:00.170
- Come on, let's sing.
- I'm not singing.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.182
This is just retarded.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.882
Come on, man, let it go. You'll feel better.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.541
Yo, that was dope, Bob.

14:39.111 --> 14:40.271
Take five?

14:42.848 --> 14:44.873
We got to get out of here, man.

14:45.851 --> 14:48.615
- That big dude is making me nervous.
- Why?

14:49.121 --> 14:52.784
Any time you see a White guy in jail,
you know he did something bad.

14:56.395 --> 15:00.161
We got to get a message to Uncle Phil.
He's a lawyer, he'll get us out of here.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.325
But they won't give us
any more phone calls.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.629
Not that it matters.

15:03.702 --> 15:07.001
The game was on so loud,
Mrs. Furth couldn't even hear what I said.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.905
- The game?
- Yeah, the football game on TV.

15:09.975 --> 15:11.670
That's all they do at these retreats.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.178
All right, we out of here. I got an idea.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.511
- Yo!
- Yeah.

15:17.149 --> 15:19.674
My buddy here is ready to confess.

15:22.955 --> 15:25.651
Come on! Look at this!

15:25.724 --> 15:29.353
- He's going for a touchdown!
- Go!

15:29.428 --> 15:31.862
<i>We interrupt this game
for a special report.</i>

15:31.931 --> 15:32.955
You bum!

15:33.732 --> 15:36.428
<i>This is Steve Goddard
of the Minuteman-21 news team...</i>

15:36.502 --> 15:38.060
<i>at the Santa Juanesta police station.</i>

15:38.137 --> 15:40.935
<i>The recent rash of car thefts
in the Palm Springs area...</i>

15:41.006 --> 15:44.498
<i>has been solved, as the perpetrators
were arrested this evening.</i>

15:44.576 --> 15:46.567
<i>The ringleader agreed to confess...</i>

15:46.645 --> 15:49.614
<i>only if a camera crew were present
to broadcast live.</i>

15:49.682 --> 15:53.812
<i>What you are about to see
is a Minuteman-21 news exclusive.</i>

15:54.353 --> 15:55.843
<i>Yeah, we done it.</i>

16:02.261 --> 16:03.785
<i>Word to Big Bird.</i>

16:03.862 --> 16:07.958
<i>We flicked eight Benzitos, 15 Jags,
and a Maserati!</i>

16:08.033 --> 16:11.833
<i>But I didn't like the upholstery
so I took it back, Jack!</i>

16:13.605 --> 16:15.573
<i>Do you have anything to say?</i>

16:16.208 --> 16:17.470
<i>Dad.</i>

16:46.071 --> 16:48.301
- Aunt Viv!
- Dad!

16:48.374 --> 16:49.807
Who's in charge here?

16:49.875 --> 16:52.537
- I am.
- Let those kids out.

16:52.611 --> 16:56.479
- These kids are car thieves.
- You have made a big mistake.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.547
I don't know how you got
that bogus confession out of them...

16:59.618 --> 17:02.348
but those two boys haven't stolen a thing
from anyone.

17:02.421 --> 17:06.482
<i>This is the biggest amateur operation
I have seen since Mayberry R.F.D.</i>

17:10.162 --> 17:13.996
- Could you ask your wife to calm down?
- Calm yourself, Barney Fife.

17:14.266 --> 17:15.563
Vivian, please.

17:15.634 --> 17:18.797
Officers, I'm sure we can clear
this whole matter up quite easily.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.736
Could you please sit down?
We're busy now.

17:20.806 --> 17:23.205
Honey, we're about to get very busy.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.976
- Sit down!
- Hey!

17:30.049 --> 17:31.846
You don't talk to my wife like that.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.215
Who the hell do you think you're talking...

17:34.286 --> 17:36.277
Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

17:36.355 --> 17:38.915
- What's going on?
- May I help you, sir?

17:38.991 --> 17:40.151
I'm Henry Furth.

17:40.225 --> 17:44.286
Good news. Your car is safe and sound.
And we've got the perpetrators.

17:44.363 --> 17:48.094
Those aren't the perpetrators.
Those are my partner's son and nephew.

17:48.167 --> 17:49.191
Partner?

17:49.268 --> 17:50.792
Legal partner.

17:51.837 --> 17:54.237
I've got a few questions for you.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.974
When you got this alleged confession
from them...

17:57.042 --> 17:58.509
did they have a lawyer present?

17:58.577 --> 18:02.343
No. Because I'm their lawyer.
Did you notify their parents?

18:02.514 --> 18:07.008
No. Because we're their parents.
So, Officer, don't tell us to wait.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.610
And don't tell us to sit down.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.212
Just open that damn cell
and let those two boys out...

18:11.290 --> 18:13.622
or I'll tie this place up
with so much litigation...

18:13.692 --> 18:16.388
that your grandchildren
are gonna need lawyers!

18:22.301 --> 18:23.996
Open the cell, Jerry.

18:33.479 --> 18:34.810
Peace out, Bob.

18:50.729 --> 18:55.632
POLICE

19:02.941 --> 19:04.875
Geoffrey, I want a duck salad.

19:05.177 --> 19:06.974
When exactly do you go back on duty?

19:07.045 --> 19:09.479
When your parents
walk through that door...

19:09.548 --> 19:11.379
and not a moment sooner.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.940
Hi. We're home.

19:14.052 --> 19:15.178
Drat.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.623
Hilary, how did everything go with Ashley?

19:18.690 --> 19:20.624
Mother, she was a little angel.

19:20.692 --> 19:23.559
She polished my nails
and cleaned out my closet.

19:23.629 --> 19:27.827
To reward her, we went to this café that's
owned by John Cougar Mellencamp...

19:27.900 --> 19:30.528
Kim Basinger,
and Doogie Howser's business manager.

19:30.602 --> 19:32.968
And we spent the afternoon
drinking espresso.

19:33.038 --> 19:34.835
You let Ashley drink espresso?

19:34.907 --> 19:37.205
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad! Let's go play!

19:37.276 --> 19:39.403
Come on, everybody, let's go play!

19:42.047 --> 19:44.743
Not tonight, sweetie,
we kind of had an exhausting weekend.

19:44.816 --> 19:46.511
- What happened?
- We got arrested.

19:46.585 --> 19:49.452
- Arrested?
- By who? The fashion police?

19:51.557 --> 19:54.924
No. The police thought
we stole Mr. Furth's car.

19:54.993 --> 19:57.393
But they were just trying to do their jobs.

19:57.462 --> 19:58.986
Why did they think you stole it?

19:59.064 --> 20:01.760
Hilary, we've been over that all weekend.
It's late.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.357
I think we all should go to bed.

20:03.435 --> 20:06.131
I don't want to. I want to play Monopoly,
I want to jump up.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.139
Let's go paint my room!

20:09.308 --> 20:11.708
Geoffrey, some warm milk, please.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.535
- Yo, Carlton.
- Yeah?

20:14.680 --> 20:17.649
Those cops
were just trying to do their jobs?

20:17.950 --> 20:19.815
Don't get all bent out of shape.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.716
You didn't learn anything this weekend.

20:21.787 --> 20:24.347
I most certainly did. Always bring a map.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.049
What?

20:26.124 --> 20:27.648
If we would have had a map...

20:27.726 --> 20:31.287
we wouldn't have to drive 2 miles an hour
to find a freeway entrance...

20:31.363 --> 20:33.593
and we wouldn't have been stopped.

20:33.665 --> 20:35.997
Okay. I get it now.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.593
We were stopped
because we were driving too slow.

20:38.670 --> 20:43.471
We were breaking the slowness limit.
Okay, I've never heard of that law before.

20:43.542 --> 20:44.975
But I did hear this other law.

20:45.043 --> 20:48.740
It's the "if you see a Black guy driving
anything but a burned-out Pinto...

20:48.814 --> 20:51.305
"you better stop him
because he stole it" law.

20:51.383 --> 20:52.748
I heard about that one.

20:52.818 --> 20:55.116
But I thought it was "the Black guy law"...

20:55.187 --> 20:58.588
when in actuality,
it was the "slowness limit law."

20:58.657 --> 21:00.750
Thank you for sharing that with me.
Good night.

21:00.826 --> 21:03.761
- They were just doing their job.
- Good night, Carlton.

21:03.829 --> 21:07.094
What's your complaint here?
We were detained for a few hours...

21:07.165 --> 21:10.965
Dad cleared things up,
and we were released. The system works.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.761
I hope you like that system...

21:13.839 --> 21:16.273
'cause you'll be seeing a lot of it
in your lifetime.

21:16.341 --> 21:18.172
Not if I bring a map.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.815
You just don't get it, do you?

21:24.883 --> 21:28.182
No map is going to save you,
and neither is your glee club...

21:28.253 --> 21:31.188
or your fancy Bel-Air address
or who your daddy is.

21:31.256 --> 21:34.089
When you're driving in a nice car
in a strange neighborhood...

21:34.159 --> 21:35.490
none of that matters.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.494
They only see one thing.

21:38.597 --> 21:41.760
Maybe growing up where you did
has made you a little touchy...

21:41.833 --> 21:44.427
but I think you've blown this thing
out of proportion.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.562
If you look at the facts...

21:46.705 --> 21:49.139
Carlton, it's late.

21:49.641 --> 21:53.077
- It's a school day tomorrow, son.
- Yeah, okay, Dad.

21:54.313 --> 21:58.044
It was awfully nice of Mr. Furth
to help us out.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.879
I'll have to write him a thank-you note.

22:00.952 --> 22:03.887
It shouldn't have happened
in the first place, son.

22:03.955 --> 22:05.354
Good night.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.217
Dad.

22:11.730 --> 22:13.755
If you were a policeman...

22:13.899 --> 22:16.925
and you saw a car
driving 2 miles an hour...

22:17.602 --> 22:19.433
wouldn't you stop it?

22:20.405 --> 22:23.897
I asked myself that question
the first time I was stopped.

22:25.310 --> 22:26.937
Good night, son.

22:32.384 --> 22:33.976
I would stop it.

22:34.305 --> 22:40.487
