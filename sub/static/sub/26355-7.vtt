Head out
where the real fun begins.

02:10.016 --> 02:11.191
There was plenty of road left!

02:11.235 --> 02:12.453
Where the paved roads
leave off.

02:12.497 --> 02:13.672
Aah! My balls!
It's too bumpy.

02:13.715 --> 02:15.326
Potholes and bumps and ruts
can come as they will.

Of course, honey.
We wouldn't miss it.

02:34.736 --> 02:37.086
Plus, it's a good excuse
to put on my winter coat

02:37.130 --> 02:39.654
and find items from last year
still in the pocket.

02:39.698 --> 02:43.441
Ooh, sticky pennies,
a rock-hard Starburst,

02:43.484 --> 02:45.573
an appointment card
for my next dental appointment

02:45.617 --> 02:47.227
that's already come and gone,

02:47.271 --> 02:49.490
a ticket stub for a matinee
of Interstellar,

02:49.534 --> 02:51.927
an unwrapped piece of Dentyne,

02:51.971 --> 02:54.234
a yarmulke from when
that Jewish guy died,

now-defunct Clorets corporation,

cross-country skiing

-Yeah.

Well, that doesn't sound
so hard. Can I try?

03:19.303 --> 03:20.608
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

03:20.652 --> 03:22.480
My event starts soon.

03:22.523 --> 03:24.743
Meg, it is my duty
as a bad father to prove

03:24.786 --> 03:26.614
that I can do anything
my kids can do.

03:26.658 --> 03:28.703
Okay, fine.

03:31.184 --> 03:32.359
Here we go.

03:34.535 --> 03:37.408
All right, I think
I'm getting the hang of it.

03:40.193 --> 03:42.282
I have to say,
I'm very proud of Meg.

03:42.326 --> 03:44.371
Who knew she was good
at something?

03:44.415 --> 03:46.460
Yeah, does anybody else in the
family have any secret talents

03:46.504 --> 03:47.722
we don't know about?

03:47.766 --> 03:50.290
I'm the Quahog edging champion.

03:50.334 --> 03:52.161
That's great, Chris.
Now what's that?

03:52.205 --> 03:55.382
It's the practice
of erotic sexual denial.

03:55.426 --> 03:57.428
Go wait in the car.

03:58.559 --> 04:00.735
And no edging!

04:00.779 --> 04:02.520
MAN:
But he did continue edging,

04:02.563 --> 04:04.957
bringing himself to the verge
of sexual pleasure,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.002
only to stop
at the last moment.

04:07.046 --> 04:08.961
I'm Ron Howard,
and I do voice-overs

04:09.004 --> 04:10.484

04:10.528 --> 04:12.530
WOMAN: But that was
the only voice-over

04:12.573 --> 04:13.748
Ron Howard did for the show.

04:13.792 --> 04:15.750
He asked for too much money.

04:15.794 --> 04:19.101
I'm Kristen Bell, and I do
reasonably-priced voice-overs.

04:19.145 --> 04:20.799
MAN:
But her voice-overs

04:20.842 --> 04:23.802
were not reasonably priced,
so they turned to me,

like Morgan Freeman,

are you doing anything later?

grab dinner or something.

Yeah, sure. You seem cool.
That could be fun.
