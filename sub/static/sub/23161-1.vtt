00:00.935 --> 00:01.992
Deirdre!

00:05.906 --> 00:07.874
<i>Now, I'm telling you,</i>
<i>our pal is in trouble.</i>

00:07.942 --> 00:09.466
<i>This lady can be fatal.</i>

00:09.977 --> 00:14.175
<i>It's as if our lives</i>
<i>are to be intermeshed,</i>

00:14.648 --> 00:16.274
<i>and there's nothing</i>
<i>I can do about it.</i>

00:16.350 --> 00:17.874
You're falling in love.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.480
I will!

00:19.920 --> 00:21.319
Higgins, are you
up to something?

00:21.388 --> 00:22.377
I am.

00:24.091 --> 00:25.285
She's in danger.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.719
Nice doggies.
You wanna be friends?

02:39.428 --> 02:41.328
You're not
frightening me, Deirdre.

02:41.397 --> 02:43.456
I'm not trying to,
sister darling.

02:43.532 --> 02:46.000
Yes, you are.
You always are.

02:46.068 --> 02:48.866
From as far back
as I can remember.

02:48.938 --> 02:50.838
Only this time,
I won't let you.

02:55.244 --> 02:56.438
Deirdre!

03:06.722 --> 03:08.019
You're insane.

03:08.591 --> 03:11.185
Oh, that's your bag,
little one, not mine.

03:11.260 --> 03:14.058
Stop calling me that.
Being 15 minutes older than me

03:14.129 --> 03:16.461
doesn't give you the right
to treat me like a child.

03:16.532 --> 03:19.228
Who told you that,
dear Dr. Bernard?

03:19.301 --> 03:20.928
I'll have to set him straight.

03:21.570 --> 03:22.969
You stay away from Ted.

03:24.273 --> 03:25.570
Would if I could.

03:26.141 --> 03:29.975
Please, just this once,
don't interfere.

03:30.179 --> 03:31.578
Someone has to protect you.

03:31.647 --> 03:33.979
You're very naive
where men are concerned.

03:34.049 --> 03:36.711
You tend to believe anything
they whisper in your ear.

03:36.785 --> 03:39.413
I love Ted,
and I believe he loves me.

03:39.488 --> 03:42.855
You see, you're already
confusing love with lust.

03:43.692 --> 03:45.057
I know the difference.

03:45.628 --> 03:47.061
I don't think so.

03:47.930 --> 03:52.333
Otherwise, the dear doctor
would be sleeping with you
instead of with me.

04:12.254 --> 04:14.017
<i>It happened at 0400.</i>

04:15.558 --> 04:18.118
<i>From the middle of a deep,</i>
<i>dreamless sleep,</i>

04:18.192 --> 04:22.527
<i>I sat stark upright in bed</i>
<i>with an overwhelming feeling</i>
<i>of anticipation.</i>

04:23.465 --> 04:26.059
<i>Someone was coming. A woman.</i>

04:26.869 --> 04:28.564
<i>I didn't know who or why.</i>

04:30.272 --> 04:31.762
<i>All I could do was hope.</i>

04:38.180 --> 04:39.306
<i>Michelle?</i>

04:42.985 --> 04:44.247
No.

04:54.930 --> 04:58.195
I'm sorry. You're obviously
expecting someone else.

04:58.267 --> 04:59.393
It's okay.

04:59.902 --> 05:01.062
Are you sure?

05:01.170 --> 05:04.071
If you're waiting for someone,
I can come back another time.

05:04.139 --> 05:07.074
No. No, you're the one
I was waiting for.

05:08.110 --> 05:09.441
Pardon me?

05:09.745 --> 05:14.478
Well, I mean, I was sort
of expecting someone else,
but it's okay, Miss...

05:15.384 --> 05:17.181
Dupres. Diane Dupres.

05:17.252 --> 05:18.742
Thomas Magnum.

05:19.622 --> 05:22.386
But then, you'd know that
if you came here to see me,
wouldn't you?

05:22.458 --> 05:23.584
Yes.

05:26.195 --> 05:28.060
Would you like to talk
in the shade?

05:28.130 --> 05:29.392
Oh, please.

05:35.638 --> 05:38.607
T. C: What's a five-letter
word for "deadly"?

05:38.974 --> 05:40.100
Women.

05:40.175 --> 05:41.642
Come on.

05:42.311 --> 05:45.371
Okay, woman,
especially that one.

05:49.852 --> 05:51.843
T. C: Looks like
a class act to me.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.387
That's what
makes her deadly.

05:53.455 --> 05:55.582
You know how Thomas
falls for class acts.

05:56.525 --> 06:00.222
Yeah, his last date was
that lady mud wrassler
from the swamp.

06:00.295 --> 06:03.890
That was just a date.
This is the type
that he gets in trouble with.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.666
You know what
the funniest part
was, though?

06:07.736 --> 06:09.863
She stood behind
that palm tree
for, like, 30 minutes

06:09.938 --> 06:11.405
and just watched him.

06:11.907 --> 06:15.206
Maybe she's a little
nervous about hiring
a private investigator.

06:15.611 --> 06:17.545
I guess. But she still
gives me the willies.

06:17.613 --> 06:21.049
Now, I'm telling you,
our pal is in trouble.
This lady can be fatal.

06:22.317 --> 06:24.717
Fatal? Hey, thanks!

06:24.820 --> 06:25.844
Sure.

06:26.555 --> 06:27.715
What?

06:27.790 --> 06:29.758
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

06:29.825 --> 06:32.692
People who want to hire
a private investigator

06:32.761 --> 06:35.355
usually feel a little
foolish doing it.

06:35.431 --> 06:37.023
They do?
Mmm-hmm.

06:37.332 --> 06:39.960
Well, obviously not
if they're meeting you.

06:40.035 --> 06:42.526
You have a very nice
bedside manner.

06:44.573 --> 06:47.542
I mean,
you really make...

06:47.609 --> 06:51.204
You really put me at ease
and doctors have to
do the same thing.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.804
God, I'm so embarrassed.

06:52.881 --> 06:55.679
It's okay. I do the same
sort of thing all the time.

06:55.751 --> 06:56.740
You do?

06:56.819 --> 06:58.286
Yeah. Just ask my friends.

06:59.455 --> 07:01.013
Still, what you
must think. I...

07:01.090 --> 07:03.422
I think you're
a very attractive woman

07:04.159 --> 07:06.787
who is a bit nervous
about hiring me.

07:08.764 --> 07:09.924
Thanks, Rosine.

07:13.068 --> 07:16.504
Still, I may not need you.
I may just be paranoid.

07:17.106 --> 07:21.167
Well, people who think
they may just be paranoid
usually aren't.

07:22.778 --> 07:25.042
Well, these things
have been happening.

07:25.447 --> 07:26.505
What things?

07:26.582 --> 07:27.844
Well, little things.

07:28.517 --> 07:31.543
I feel as if
I'm being followed

07:31.720 --> 07:35.019
and I hear footsteps,
but I turn and no one's there.

07:35.991 --> 07:37.049
What else?

07:38.494 --> 07:39.961
I think someone shot at me.

07:41.764 --> 07:44.824
My family has a home
up above Punchbowl,

07:44.900 --> 07:46.390
at the end of Old Pali Road.

07:46.468 --> 07:47.901
The old Burger Estate?

07:47.970 --> 07:49.301
Yes. You know it?

07:50.005 --> 07:51.404
Well, I know of it.

07:51.940 --> 07:53.532
And someone
shot at you there?

07:53.909 --> 07:56.241
Well, I was watching
the sunset one evening,

07:56.311 --> 07:58.472
and a floodlight near me
just shattered.

07:58.580 --> 08:03.347
Well, the gardener said that
that happens sometimes
when the sprinklers are on,

08:04.686 --> 08:07.280
but I really feel
that I heard a shot.

08:09.792 --> 08:12.260
I come from
a very wealthy family.

08:12.594 --> 08:14.221
We own Dupres Fabrics.

08:16.632 --> 08:18.395
Yeah, I've heard
of the company.

08:19.001 --> 08:21.094
Then perhaps you've heard
of my twin sister and I.

08:21.170 --> 08:23.070
We were kidnapped
when we were five

08:23.138 --> 08:25.129
and ransomed
for a million dollars.

08:28.010 --> 08:32.241
Well, yeah, I vaguely recall
hearing something about that.

08:32.313 --> 08:34.043
I mean, it was
a long time ago.

08:36.751 --> 08:38.947
That must have been
very traumatic for you.

08:39.488 --> 08:43.219
I don't remember.
The doctors tell me
I've blocked it out,

08:44.025 --> 08:45.323
but Deirdre remembers.

08:45.394 --> 08:48.454
She's always been
much better at coping than I.

08:48.730 --> 08:52.393
Well, four months ago
we had a rather nasty
auto accident.

08:52.801 --> 08:54.996
It's a miracle
either of us survived.

08:56.538 --> 08:58.665
We were having a row over...

09:00.375 --> 09:02.502
Well, it was all my fault,

09:03.445 --> 09:05.174
and when I was released
from the hospital,

09:05.247 --> 09:07.875
I just didn't want to deal
with Deirdre's accusations,

09:08.584 --> 09:11.052
so I flew out here
for a while

09:11.119 --> 09:13.781
to get some sun
and put some perspective
in my life.

09:14.823 --> 09:17.189
That's when those things
began to happen.

09:17.993 --> 09:19.119
Oh.

09:20.062 --> 09:21.859
I've kept a diary.

09:22.998 --> 09:25.626
Ever since the kidnapping,
Daddy made us write down

09:25.701 --> 09:28.898
anything that was even
remotely suspicious
during the day.

09:29.571 --> 09:32.199
You'll find everything
I've done on the island
in there.

09:36.812 --> 09:38.211
Why'd you come to me?

09:39.147 --> 09:40.876
Well, you're
a private investigator.

09:40.949 --> 09:44.441
Yeah, I know. There are
37 private investigators
in the Honolulu phone book.

09:44.519 --> 09:45.713
Why me?

09:47.122 --> 09:49.955
You're right. I looked
through the phone book

09:50.025 --> 09:52.016
and I just didn't know
who to call.

09:52.928 --> 09:54.725
And then I saw your name

09:56.365 --> 09:58.765
and I just felt you were
meant to help me.

10:03.205 --> 10:04.467
Excuse me.

10:06.041 --> 10:08.441
T. C: Has she set the hook
or is she still trolling?

10:08.510 --> 10:10.034
Lxnay, ixnay.

10:10.412 --> 10:11.436
Amazing.

10:11.513 --> 10:15.609
L-X-N-A-Y. Lxnay.

10:15.984 --> 10:18.578
You are in big,
big trouble.

10:18.720 --> 10:19.880
What?

10:19.955 --> 10:22.685
Orville here seems to think
you're falling madly in love.

10:22.758 --> 10:24.419
Don't be silly.

10:24.493 --> 10:25.755
She is interesting,
though.

10:25.827 --> 10:26.816
I knew it.

10:26.929 --> 10:27.918
Knew what?

10:27.996 --> 10:29.395
That Thomas has
fallen in love.

10:29.464 --> 10:30.522
Wonderful.

10:30.599 --> 10:32.123
Don't pay any attention...

10:32.567 --> 10:33.727
What did you say?

10:33.802 --> 10:35.167
I said wonderful.

10:35.404 --> 10:38.703
Perhaps you can invite
the young lady over
for tea some afternoon.

10:38.774 --> 10:41.072
I'd like to make
her acquaintance.

10:41.143 --> 10:42.735
She must be quite special.

10:45.647 --> 10:47.581
Are you all right,
Higgie baby?

10:47.649 --> 10:49.879
Fit as a fiddle,
as Nero said.

10:54.089 --> 10:55.454
You been
drinking, Higgins?

10:55.524 --> 10:57.253
No, but it's a capital idea.

10:57.326 --> 10:59.260
In fact, I'd like to buy
all of you a drink.

10:59.328 --> 11:00.556
Rosine.

11:01.196 --> 11:02.288
Okay.

11:03.298 --> 11:04.993
Higgins, are you
up to something?

11:05.067 --> 11:08.662
Well, as a matter of fact,
I am.

11:09.438 --> 11:10.735
Aha.

11:12.207 --> 11:13.970
I have decided to marry.

11:16.878 --> 11:18.675
Agatha finally got to you?

11:18.747 --> 11:21.682
Agatha?
Oh, good heavens, no.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.809
I'm betrothed
to Lady Ashley.

11:24.086 --> 11:25.178
Who?

11:25.253 --> 11:26.686
Lady Ashley.

11:26.755 --> 11:28.882
Surely you chaps have
heard me speak of her.

11:28.957 --> 11:32.654
We were engaged
when I shipped off
to North Africa with Monty.

11:32.728 --> 11:36.027
Well, I was gone
a long time.

11:36.098 --> 11:38.089
Four years, actually.

11:38.333 --> 11:42.201
And when I returned,
she had married Lord Ashley.

11:42.671 --> 11:44.935
She's the one built like
the Prince Albert Memorial.

11:45.007 --> 11:48.170
Magnum, please,
we're speaking
of my future wife.

11:49.211 --> 11:50.838
Well, what happened
to Lord Ashley?

11:50.912 --> 11:52.937
A bit of underdone potato.

11:53.615 --> 11:54.809
He choked to death.

11:55.817 --> 11:57.648
Actually, I suppose
it was to be expected.

11:57.719 --> 12:00.779
He always did wolf
his food down like a cretin.

12:00.989 --> 12:05.255
Anyway, when I heard,
I wrote to Lady Ashley
at once to console her.

12:05.994 --> 12:10.590
One letter led to another,
I proposed, and she accepted.

12:10.966 --> 12:12.456
Well, that's great.
Just great.

12:12.534 --> 12:15.059
Yeah, that is great.
That calls for
a bachelor party.

12:15.137 --> 12:17.537
Well, that's terribly
thoughtful of you, Rick.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.870
A bachelor dinner
would be quite delightful.

12:19.941 --> 12:23.138
Good food, a nice claret,
just you chaps

12:23.211 --> 12:25.577
and the lads, of course.

12:26.114 --> 12:28.275
That ain't the kind of party
I had in mind.

12:28.350 --> 12:29.681
Higgins,

12:29.985 --> 12:32.078
let me be the first
to propose a toast.

12:32.154 --> 12:33.746
T. C: Hey, hear, hear.

12:36.224 --> 12:37.521
What is it, Magnum?

12:42.531 --> 12:43.896
She's in danger.

13:41.556 --> 13:43.114
Don't move till I tell you.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.523
I'm gonna distract them

13:46.428 --> 13:47.895
and when I say, "Now,"

13:47.963 --> 13:49.931
you just edge slowly
towards the door.

13:52.634 --> 13:54.602
Hi, guys.
Here, doggies.

13:56.371 --> 13:57.429
Now.

14:01.743 --> 14:03.404
Hi, dogs.

14:03.478 --> 14:05.605
Hey, come on.
No, you wouldn't like me.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.375
Just ask Zeus and Apollo.

14:13.455 --> 14:15.548
Can you hurry up
just a little bit, please?

14:16.658 --> 14:17.852
I'm in.

14:20.428 --> 14:22.191
Nice doggies.
Wanna be friends?

14:52.478 --> 14:53.638
This is nothing.

14:54.113 --> 14:57.173
I was hunting up in Utah,
must've been '68, '69.

14:57.850 --> 15:00.546
A pack of wild dogs
brought down a deer hunter.

15:00.619 --> 15:02.814
His right leg was nearly
chewed off at the knee.

15:02.888 --> 15:04.185
But that wasn't
the worst part.

15:04.256 --> 15:05.416
Doc.
Huh?

15:05.491 --> 15:07.186
Could we change
the subject?

15:07.259 --> 15:08.419
Oh, yeah. Sure.

15:09.395 --> 15:11.590
You're gonna have to stay
out of the water for a while.

15:11.664 --> 15:12.756
Of course.

15:12.831 --> 15:14.696
I don't want you to
get a staph infection.

15:14.767 --> 15:19.033
I had a kid once who got
so infected his leg swelled up
to the size of a ripe melon.

15:19.104 --> 15:20.799
I had to take a probe,
you know, and...

15:20.873 --> 15:22.101
Doc!
Huh?

15:25.110 --> 15:28.568
Just a few more of these
and the worst will be over
until tomorrow.

15:29.181 --> 15:30.205
Tomorrow?

15:30.282 --> 15:32.011
It won't really hurt
until then.

15:32.484 --> 15:34.281
It hurts like hell now.

15:35.020 --> 15:36.282
Wait until tomorrow.

15:42.361 --> 15:44.192
I wasn't sure
of the sizes.

15:50.502 --> 15:52.629
I'm just gonna wait outside.

15:56.909 --> 16:00.106
Funny, isn't it,
how squeamish women can be
about a few stitches?

16:01.046 --> 16:02.775
You say
she shot both dogs?

16:03.549 --> 16:04.743
Saved my life.

16:05.184 --> 16:06.515
Doesn't seem the type.

16:10.656 --> 16:12.954
<i>According to the police,</i>
<i>the dogs attacked a couple</i>

16:13.025 --> 16:16.153
<i>less than a mile from Diane's</i>
<i>earlier in the day.</i>

16:16.395 --> 16:18.454
<i>The attack on us appeared</i>
<i>to be nothing more than</i>

16:18.530 --> 16:21.158
<i>being in the wrong place</i>
<i>at the wrong time.</i>

16:21.233 --> 16:23.133
<i>But something strange</i>
<i>was happening,</i>

16:23.202 --> 16:25.397
<i>something I couldn't explain.</i>

16:26.405 --> 16:28.600
You handled that.38
like a pro today.

16:29.441 --> 16:32.239
Father made us
take shooting lessons
as we grew up.

16:32.611 --> 16:35.079
I haven't fired
a gun in years.

16:35.547 --> 16:38.141
I never really was
much of a marksman.

16:41.019 --> 16:43.453
Deirdre was always
the crack shot.

16:44.790 --> 16:45.950
Not today.

16:47.826 --> 16:50.351
Well, to my latent talents.

16:52.798 --> 16:53.856
Pardon?

16:54.366 --> 16:55.594
Shooting the gun.

16:56.368 --> 16:57.357
Oh.

17:08.881 --> 17:11.509
Do you really think
that attack today
was an accident?

17:14.219 --> 17:15.481
Probably.

17:16.588 --> 17:18.351
Maybe I am paranoid.

17:18.723 --> 17:21.715
Look, no offense,
but kidnapped at five,

17:21.794 --> 17:23.989
a father who makes you
take shooting lessons

17:24.061 --> 17:26.723
and keep a daily diary
of suspicious persons.

17:26.799 --> 17:29.859
Well, I'd say it'd be amazing
if you and your sister
weren't paranoid.

17:30.536 --> 17:32.060
Deirdre's not paranoid.

17:32.938 --> 17:34.303
Tell me more about her.

17:35.874 --> 17:37.307
What do you want
to know?

17:39.578 --> 17:41.705
Well, have things been
happening to her?

17:43.348 --> 17:46.784
I haven't spoken to Deirdre
since I left the hospital.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.651
Is that usual?

17:51.023 --> 17:54.083
We may be identical twins,
but we're not alike.

17:54.927 --> 17:58.294
We never dressed alike,
thought alike

17:58.764 --> 17:59.992
or felt alike.

18:01.433 --> 18:05.096
Deirdre smokes, I don't.
She's left-handed, I'm right.

18:05.838 --> 18:08.272
She's aggressive, outgoing.

18:09.074 --> 18:10.132
Sexy.

18:10.576 --> 18:12.635
Well, being sexy
isn't everything.

18:13.078 --> 18:14.978
Well, not that
you're not sexy.

18:15.514 --> 18:17.345
I mean, I personally
find you very sexy,

18:17.416 --> 18:20.715
but not in
an overt way, just...

18:20.953 --> 18:23.683
You sure know how to put
your foot in it like I do.

18:24.489 --> 18:25.717
I told you.

18:26.792 --> 18:28.783
Look,

18:30.729 --> 18:34.187
I will read
your diary tonight

18:34.466 --> 18:36.491
and I'll call you
in the morning.

18:36.568 --> 18:38.297
Breakfast at the club?

18:38.570 --> 18:40.060
I'd like that.

18:40.539 --> 18:42.439
You know how to reach me
if you need me?

18:42.507 --> 18:43.565
Yes.

18:58.624 --> 18:59.852
Diane.

19:02.995 --> 19:04.656
I knew you were
coming today.

19:05.097 --> 19:06.189
What?

19:06.732 --> 19:09.132
I woke up
in the middle of the night

19:09.201 --> 19:12.170
feeling that someone important
was about to enter my life.

19:13.105 --> 19:14.732
I think it's you.

19:16.842 --> 19:19.470
I just had to tell you that.
Good night.

19:36.261 --> 19:39.162
<i>Rule number one</i>
<i>in the Private</i>
<i>Investigator's Manual.</i>

19:39.231 --> 19:41.756
<i>Never get involved</i>
<i>with female clients.</i>

19:41.833 --> 19:44.893
<i>Rule number two.</i>
<i>Never break rule number one.</i>

19:46.071 --> 19:50.303
<i>I was about to shatter both,</i>
<i>and to be honest,</i>
<i>I couldn't have cared less.</i>

20:22.040 --> 20:24.008
Higgins, I'm in trouble.

20:25.978 --> 20:27.946
Admitting one is
mentally disturbed

20:28.013 --> 20:30.481
is the first step
toward recovery.

20:32.551 --> 20:34.416
Good God, what happened?

20:35.387 --> 20:38.083
I was attacked
by a pair of dogs.

20:39.024 --> 20:40.457
Not the lads?

20:40.759 --> 20:42.124
Not this time.

20:42.260 --> 20:43.318
Hi, guys.

20:46.865 --> 20:50.926
Does this have something to do
with your bizarre behavior
at the club this afternoon?

20:51.703 --> 20:54.069
Higgins, I knew
Diane was in trouble.

20:54.139 --> 20:55.265
Diane?

20:55.340 --> 20:57.740
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's a client.

20:59.811 --> 21:03.440
Well, actually she's more
than just a client.

21:04.816 --> 21:05.976
An old friend?

21:06.051 --> 21:08.042
No, I just met her today.

21:12.057 --> 21:15.151
Higgins, I woke up
this morning

21:15.927 --> 21:19.624
sensing a woman was going to
dramatically affect my life,

21:19.698 --> 21:21.495
and then I met Diane.

21:21.767 --> 21:24.133
Forgive me, Magnum,
but you are always
meeting women

21:24.202 --> 21:26.568
who seem to dramatically
affect your life.

21:26.638 --> 21:29.732
You apparently hold
some attraction for them
that I can't quite fathom,

21:29.808 --> 21:32.208
other than the obvious
primitive, animalistic...

21:32.277 --> 21:34.745
Higgins, I ran
out of the club

21:34.813 --> 21:37.611
because I suddenly felt
she was in danger.

21:37.682 --> 21:39.775
So I drove to her house,
and there she was,

21:39.851 --> 21:42.945
about to be attacked
by a couple of rottweilers.

21:44.289 --> 21:46.416
Rotts can be bloody vicious.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.627
I feel like
John Garfield, Higgins.

21:52.097 --> 21:54.395
You know, in some kind
of '40s movie.

21:54.466 --> 21:58.596
It's as if our lives
are to be intermeshed,

21:59.438 --> 22:01.906
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

22:02.574 --> 22:04.235
You're falling in love.

22:04.309 --> 22:05.833
I just met her.

22:05.911 --> 22:08.971
Well, it happens
that way sometimes
if you're lucky.

22:09.581 --> 22:13.540
I'll never forget
the day I met Elizabeth.
Lady Ashley.

22:16.488 --> 22:17.750
She's very pretty.

22:17.823 --> 22:19.222
Yes, quite.

22:19.858 --> 22:22.656
The regiment had been
posted to London that year,

22:22.727 --> 22:24.524
and even though
I was only a corporal,

22:24.596 --> 22:26.564
I had a magnificent jumper
named Wellington.

22:26.631 --> 22:29.566
Sixteen hands high,
black as Manchester coal.

22:29.701 --> 22:31.828
One morning I was
working him in Hyde Park

22:31.903 --> 22:35.134
when a runaway mare
came charging out
of Kensington Gardens.

22:35.574 --> 22:38.134
I managed to stop her
by the reflecting pond.

22:38.210 --> 22:40.337
You know, where the geese
usually gather.

22:40.412 --> 22:41.572
No.

22:41.646 --> 22:42.840
Well, it doesn't matter.

22:42.914 --> 22:46.680
The point is that when
I reined in the mare and got
my first look at Elizabeth,

22:46.751 --> 22:51.154
I swear to you, Magnum,
that I knew that someday
she'd be my wife.

22:54.860 --> 22:57.727
Higgins, you're a romantic.

22:59.931 --> 23:01.489
Yes, I suppose I am.

23:02.734 --> 23:03.928
But so are you,

23:04.002 --> 23:05.560
which is why
you shouldn't be shocked

23:05.637 --> 23:07.366
that you're falling in love
with someone you've just met.

23:07.439 --> 23:08.963
I am not in love with her,

23:12.711 --> 23:14.235
but I'm afraid I could be.

23:15.614 --> 23:17.946
Why is that so terrifying?

23:18.650 --> 23:20.914
Something tells me
it'll end up like Michelle.

23:21.019 --> 23:22.281
Ah.

23:23.088 --> 23:25.056
Now we come
to the crux of it.

23:26.691 --> 23:29.489
You're afraid of
falling in love with her

23:29.794 --> 23:31.785
because someday
you might lose her.

23:32.597 --> 23:35.191
One Michelle
in a lifetime is enough.

23:35.867 --> 23:38.927
But what if Diane is
not another Michelle?

23:39.638 --> 23:40.969
What if she is?

23:42.641 --> 23:45.075
Magnum,
it's a terribly old cliché,

23:45.744 --> 23:48.178
but it is better
to have loved and lost

23:48.246 --> 23:50.043
than never to have
loved at all.

23:53.218 --> 23:54.685
No, it's not.

24:19.144 --> 24:21.772
<i>I could always count on</i>
<i>Doc Ibold's medical opinions</i>

24:21.847 --> 24:24.543
<i>being pretty close to</i>
<i>right on the nose.</i>

24:25.383 --> 24:26.611
<i>Damn it.</i>

24:32.090 --> 24:34.615
<i>It took me half an hour</i>
<i>just to make it</i>
<i>to the tidal pool,</i>

24:34.693 --> 24:37.924
<i>another half</i>
<i>before the saltwater</i>
<i>began to ease the pain.</i>

24:37.996 --> 24:40.863
<i>I know, I was supposed</i>
<i>to stay out of the water,</i>

24:40.932 --> 24:43.298
<i>but I've always been</i>
<i>able to think clearly</i>
<i>when swimming,</i>

24:43.368 --> 24:46.804
<i>and right now, that was</i>
<i>more important to me</i>
<i>than any risk of infection.</i>

24:47.305 --> 24:51.674
<i>I had to decide if I was</i>
<i>going to walk away from Diane</i>
<i>before it was too late,</i>

24:51.743 --> 24:53.335
<i>before the curve of her neck</i>

24:53.411 --> 24:55.538
<i>or the look in her eyes</i>
<i>hooked me.</i>

24:55.614 --> 24:58.708
<i>And then I realized</i>
<i>it was already too late.</i>

24:59.251 --> 25:02.584
<i>She'd stirred feelings</i>
<i>I thought were dead</i>
<i>and gone forever.</i>

25:02.654 --> 25:05.088
<i>There's only one thing</i>
<i>you can do when that happens.</i>

25:05.157 --> 25:07.216
T.C. ON HEADSET: Go for it.
That's my motto.

25:08.193 --> 25:10.024
<i>That's what chopper flying</i>
<i>is all about.</i>

25:10.095 --> 25:11.187
<i>Getting down and dirty.</i>

25:12.631 --> 25:14.428
<i>Or, in this case,</i>
<i>the water.</i>

25:20.872 --> 25:22.169
<i>T.C.?</i>
<i>Yo.</i>

25:22.240 --> 25:23.730
<i>Can you</i>
<i>take it up a bit?</i>

25:24.643 --> 25:26.975
<i>Oh! Yeah. Sure.</i>

25:27.812 --> 25:29.746
<i>View's better</i>
<i>from higher up anyway.</i>

25:32.217 --> 25:34.276
<i>I didn't mean</i>
<i>to spoil your fun.</i>

25:34.853 --> 25:36.718
<i>What fun?</i>
<i>I was terrified.</i>

25:36.788 --> 25:38.050
<i>Sure you were.</i>

25:38.123 --> 25:41.217
<i>I was. Flying that low</i>
<i>terrifies me. Right, T.C.?</i>

25:41.393 --> 25:45.454
<i>Boy's a flying chicken.</i>
<i>Drop below 50 feet</i>
<i>and he white-knuckles.</i>

25:45.530 --> 25:49.796
<i>I've seen babies in diapers</i>
<i>and old ladies in bifocals</i>
<i>less afraid than he is.</i>

25:51.102 --> 25:53.297
<i>In fact, when we were</i>
<i>back in Vietnam,</i>

25:53.371 --> 25:56.932
<i>we had to blindfold him</i>
<i>when we were going</i>
<i>on the deck.</i>

25:57.008 --> 25:59.738
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>one time outside of Da Nang</i>
<i>when we were flying low...</i>

25:59.811 --> 26:02.644
<i>T.C., I don't think</i>
<i>she's buying it.</i>

26:03.148 --> 26:04.740
<i>Yes, she is.</i>

26:09.387 --> 26:10.513
<i>Look.</i>

26:11.756 --> 26:13.246
<i>How'd he get way out there?</i>

26:13.959 --> 26:15.426
T. C: <i>Walked.</i>

26:15.961 --> 26:17.553
<i>He's a fisherman.</i>

26:17.629 --> 26:22.498
<i>He knows those coral paths</i>
<i>the same way a farmer knows</i>
<i>the mountain trails.</i>

26:23.768 --> 26:27.295
<i>I thought the locals</i>
<i>on this side of the island</i>
<i>were all fishermen.</i>

26:27.806 --> 26:29.034
<i>Nah.</i>

26:29.741 --> 26:31.208
<i>See that road over there?</i>

26:31.943 --> 26:36.710
<i>An old</i> kahuna <i>told me once</i>
<i>that that determines</i>
<i>who or what you are.</i>

26:37.315 --> 26:42.218
<i>He said that if you lived</i>
<i>on the</i> makai <i>or ocean side,</i>
<i>you were a fisherman.</i>

26:42.287 --> 26:46.519
<i>But if you were on</i>
<i>the</i> mauka <i>or mountain side,</i>
<i>you were a farmer.</i>

26:47.592 --> 26:51.392
<i>Your work, social status,</i>
<i>how you think and act</i>

26:51.830 --> 26:55.266
<i>would all be determined</i>
<i>by which side of that road</i>
<i>you lived on.</i>

26:58.136 --> 27:01.071
<i>I sure wish we could all</i>
<i>have roads like that.</i>

27:01.139 --> 27:03.039
<i>Why would you want one?</i>

27:04.042 --> 27:06.237
<i>To know who I was</i>
<i>and what I had to do.</i>

27:35.273 --> 27:36.638
Thank you very much.

27:40.078 --> 27:42.308
Yoo-hoo! Jonathan!

27:44.215 --> 27:45.648
Good morning, Agatha.

27:46.718 --> 27:50.518
What a wonderful idea.
Leis for the finalists.

27:50.989 --> 27:52.149
Finalists?

27:52.223 --> 27:54.191
In the piano competition,

27:54.259 --> 27:57.023
honoring
Queen Victoria's birthday.

27:57.095 --> 27:58.323
Today at 10:00.

27:58.396 --> 28:00.956
Good Lord, Agatha,
it completely
slipped my mind.

28:01.032 --> 28:03.000
Are you feeling
quite all right?

28:03.068 --> 28:07.402
Well, I suppose
I have been a bit
absent-minded lately.

28:07.639 --> 28:10.904
You see, I've made
a rather momentous decision.

28:11.276 --> 28:12.265
Yes?

28:13.511 --> 28:17.470
Agatha, I've reached
a point in my life where...

28:18.116 --> 28:22.075
Well, let's face it,
I thought I was to die
a confirmed bachelor.

28:22.554 --> 28:23.680
I know.

28:23.755 --> 28:25.279
But I won't.

28:25.757 --> 28:30.990
I've concluded that love
only smiles on us once
or twice in our lifetime,

28:31.229 --> 28:34.687
and that we have to go
for the brass ring,
so to speak.

28:35.233 --> 28:36.564
Oh, Jonathan...

28:36.634 --> 28:39.728
Agatha, I have
decided to marry.

28:40.071 --> 28:41.368
I will!

28:41.806 --> 28:43.171
What?

28:44.676 --> 28:48.305
Oh, Jonathan,
you've made me so happy.

28:52.250 --> 28:55.811
I must phone Mother
and tell the girls.

28:56.354 --> 28:59.448
Jonathan, I love you.

29:04.963 --> 29:06.521
Oh, my God.

29:15.540 --> 29:18.008
Lady Ashley,
how delightful to see you.

29:18.076 --> 29:19.976
Did you have
a pleasant flight?

29:20.779 --> 29:22.406
No, no, no.

29:23.248 --> 29:24.647
Too ordinary.

29:28.820 --> 29:31.380
Lady Ashley, you look
positively smashing.

29:31.456 --> 29:35.187
Especially for a woman
your age. Good God, no.

29:40.398 --> 29:42.025
Lady Ashley,

29:42.634 --> 29:45.626
even these orchids
pale beside your beauty.

29:47.038 --> 29:49.632
Yes, quite good.
Agatha would approve.

29:51.476 --> 29:52.534
Agatha.

29:53.411 --> 29:55.538
How could she put me
in this position?

29:55.613 --> 29:59.777
WOMAN ON P.A. SYSTEM:
<i>Flight 119 from New York</i>
<i>is now arriving at Gate 7.</i>

30:05.390 --> 30:07.984
The way she poured my tea,
it was quite disgraceful.

30:08.059 --> 30:10.857
Yes, well,
I dare say the airlines

30:10.929 --> 30:13.830
have as much difficulty
finding decent help today
as we do, Lizzie.

30:13.898 --> 30:15.923
One would think
an English girl
would know better.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.297
Yes. Quite.

30:19.504 --> 30:22.405
Aloha. What, no lei?

30:22.474 --> 30:24.032
Where's my New York
hot dog?

30:24.108 --> 30:25.405
I guess
it's with my lei.

30:27.612 --> 30:30.672
I hope you enjoyed
your flight.

30:30.849 --> 30:33.750
Wouldn't want to be the bird
he's dating tonight.

30:33.818 --> 30:35.183
Bye-bye. Thank you.

30:35.253 --> 30:36.311
Bye.
Bye.

30:36.387 --> 30:37.911
I don't think
I'll need the raincoat.

30:37.989 --> 30:39.923
I hope Your Grace had
an enjoyable flight.

30:39.991 --> 30:41.219
Yes, I'm sure you do.

30:41.593 --> 30:42.582
Thank you.

30:43.361 --> 30:45.420
God, the English can
be pompous asses.

30:45.497 --> 30:46.623
Bye-bye.

30:46.698 --> 30:47.926
Bye.
Bye.

31:02.514 --> 31:03.845
Well, Jonathan?

31:04.482 --> 31:06.746
Aren't you going
to say aloha

31:06.818 --> 31:09.343
or some other quaint
island expression?

31:09.921 --> 31:11.252
Of course.

31:13.324 --> 31:14.484
Aloha.

31:18.830 --> 31:23.358
Lady Agatha,
even these orchids pale
beside your beauty.

31:23.835 --> 31:25.564
Lady Agatha?

31:25.803 --> 31:26.929
Pardon?

31:27.071 --> 31:30.131
You called Her Grace
"Lady Agatha."

31:30.542 --> 31:32.840
I know it's been rather
a long time, Jonathan,

31:32.911 --> 31:36.142
but I had hoped
you'd recall my name.

31:36.481 --> 31:38.972
But of course I do.

31:39.150 --> 31:40.583
Who is Lady Agatha?

31:40.652 --> 31:41.710
No one.

31:41.786 --> 31:45.051
I mean,
of course she's someone,
but not of importance.

31:45.123 --> 31:47.921
It was just a silly
slip of the tongue.

31:48.226 --> 31:50.717
Lady Agatha
isn't even a lady.

31:51.529 --> 31:55.966
Well, of course
she is a lady,
but not of the peerage.

31:57.201 --> 31:59.931
She's just a friend.
An associate.

32:00.171 --> 32:03.197
A fellow British subject
loyal to the Queen.

32:03.541 --> 32:06.305
Well, I suppose out here
in the colonies

32:06.377 --> 32:09.175
one must socialize
beneath one's station.

32:10.648 --> 32:14.414
Excuse me,
but we haven't been
properly introduced.

32:14.819 --> 32:17.310
I'm so sorry, Jonathan.

32:17.422 --> 32:19.720
I thought you knew
David Billingsworth.

32:19.791 --> 32:20.917
An old friend.

32:20.992 --> 32:22.357
How do you do?
How do you do?

32:22.427 --> 32:23.860
And my solicitor.

32:24.596 --> 32:25.824
Solicitor?

32:26.264 --> 32:28.164
Here to draw up
the deed poll, old boy.

32:28.399 --> 32:29.593
Whose deed poll?

32:30.702 --> 32:31.726
Yours.

32:32.036 --> 32:34.231
Ceding your title,
Lord Perth.

32:35.540 --> 32:37.405
Why on earth
would I do that?

32:37.475 --> 32:41.605
Well, surely, Jonathan,
you don't expect me
to give up being

32:41.679 --> 32:44.876
Duchess of Ashley
to become Lady Perth, do you?

32:45.817 --> 32:47.444
You're only a lord.

32:47.919 --> 32:49.682
Winnie was a duke.

32:50.755 --> 32:52.746
Don't worry, Jonathan.

32:52.824 --> 32:55.349
You'll simply become
Lord Higgins-Ashley.

33:08.740 --> 33:10.503
<i>Breathtaking!</i>

33:11.209 --> 33:14.610
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>I like flying off Waikiki</i>
<i>at the end of the day.</i>

33:14.679 --> 33:16.647
<i>Sure beats</i>
<i>the sunset cruises.</i>

33:17.749 --> 33:18.943
<i>Cheaper, too.</i>

34:09.167 --> 34:12.193
I had a wonderful day.
Thank you, Thomas.

34:12.603 --> 34:15.264
Well, rule number three
in the Private Investigator's
handbook

34:15.339 --> 34:17.569
is always see the client
has a nice day.

34:17.641 --> 34:18.630
Oh.

34:19.643 --> 34:22.237
Well, I didn't mean
this was all work.

34:22.413 --> 34:23.937
Oh, no. I understand.

34:24.014 --> 34:26.984
I just forgot for a moment
that you were doing a job.

34:27.318 --> 34:28.978
Well, I wasn't
doing a job.

34:29.053 --> 34:31.214
Well, I mean,
I was doing my job.

34:31.289 --> 34:33.621
I mean... Well,
that doesn't mean
I didn't enjoy it.

34:33.690 --> 34:35.090
You know what I mean?

34:40.130 --> 34:41.291
Well...

34:44.635 --> 34:47.195
Thank you again
for a wonderful day,

34:48.339 --> 34:49.772
for whatever the reason.

34:49.841 --> 34:51.034
You're welcome.

34:52.243 --> 34:53.232
Uh...

34:54.779 --> 34:57.373
I didn't get a chance
to read your diary last night.

34:57.782 --> 34:58.874
Okay.

34:58.950 --> 35:01.111
But I'll read it tonight

35:01.719 --> 35:03.584
and then I'll call you
in the morning.

35:03.654 --> 35:04.678
Okay.

35:04.756 --> 35:09.193
And maybe we could
discuss any questions
I might have over breakfast.

35:10.161 --> 35:11.594
That sounds fine.

35:13.164 --> 35:16.964
Then, maybe we should
spend tomorrow together,

35:18.836 --> 35:20.269
checking clues.

35:20.972 --> 35:22.132
Checking clues?

35:22.206 --> 35:23.298
Something like that.

35:25.710 --> 35:29.669
Thomas, how much of today
was just doing your job?

35:31.048 --> 35:32.310
None of it.

36:54.098 --> 36:56.464
<i>I hadn't realized it</i>
<i>until I left Diane,</i>

36:56.534 --> 36:58.434
<i>but I was so sore</i>
<i>and exhausted,</i>

36:58.503 --> 36:59.902
<i>I could barely drive home.</i>

37:02.273 --> 37:06.004
<i>All I wanted to do was</i>
<i>drop my body into bed</i>
<i>for eight hours,</i>

37:06.478 --> 37:08.241
<i>but it wasn't to be.</i>

37:12.016 --> 37:13.313
Higgins.

37:14.118 --> 37:16.712
What are you doing
sitting alone in the dark?

37:18.790 --> 37:20.883
Magnum, I need
your advice.

37:21.926 --> 37:23.188
My advice?

37:24.929 --> 37:26.829
I hate to admit this,

37:27.065 --> 37:28.692
but you are
a man of the world

37:28.766 --> 37:31.394
when it comes
to understanding females.

37:32.570 --> 37:34.970
Well, yeah.
I do have a certain

37:36.107 --> 37:38.200
experience in the area.

37:39.077 --> 37:40.601
What's the problem?

37:42.814 --> 37:44.179
Everything.

37:45.884 --> 37:49.012
It all began when Agatha
showed up at the estate
this afternoon.

37:54.259 --> 37:57.524
You told her
you were gonna marry
the Prince Albert...

37:59.264 --> 38:00.663
Lady Ashley.

38:02.333 --> 38:03.527
Not exactly.

38:06.237 --> 38:07.534
You didn't tell her?

38:08.973 --> 38:11.999
I told her I decided
to marry and...

38:13.444 --> 38:14.502
And?

38:16.347 --> 38:18.872
Agatha thinks
I'm going to marry her.

38:19.751 --> 38:23.482
Now, Higgins,
how could Agatha
think such a thing?

38:23.555 --> 38:25.386
Because she's
a bloody woman.

38:25.456 --> 38:26.923
I told her
I'd decided to marry.

38:26.991 --> 38:30.392
She said, "I will,"
and drove off before
I could say another word.

38:33.531 --> 38:34.998
What am I to do?

38:37.268 --> 38:38.326
Well,

38:40.338 --> 38:43.171
I think you're just gonna
have to tell her the truth.

38:43.741 --> 38:44.969
I can't.

38:45.610 --> 38:47.134
She was so happy.

38:48.012 --> 38:50.037
Magnum, it will
break her heart.

38:50.548 --> 38:54.314
Well, then I think
you have to marry Agatha
and jilt the Lady Ashley.

38:58.122 --> 38:59.919
Higgins, it was a joke.

39:01.626 --> 39:03.560
She wants me
to give up my title

39:03.628 --> 39:05.596
and become
Lord Higgins-Ashley.

39:06.264 --> 39:07.288
You? A lord?

39:09.467 --> 39:11.094
I'm already a lord, Magnum.

39:12.136 --> 39:14.036
The Baron of Perth.

39:14.639 --> 39:16.231
She wants me
to deed-poll my title

39:16.307 --> 39:18.775
because the duke's title
is more prestigious
in the peerage.

39:18.843 --> 39:20.834
But I won't do it.

39:20.912 --> 39:22.379
Your phone is ringing.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.278
No, that can wait.

39:24.349 --> 39:26.783
You're a lord?
How come you never told me?

39:26.851 --> 39:28.409
I've had my reasons.

39:29.954 --> 39:32.479
I'm the second son
of the Duke of Perth.

39:32.557 --> 39:35.788
If you're a lord,
then how come you weren't
an officer in the army?

39:36.494 --> 39:38.223
One is a matter of birth.

39:38.363 --> 39:40.058
The other is
a matter of choice.

39:44.702 --> 39:46.533
Robin Masters' estate.

39:47.639 --> 39:48.970
Just a moment.

39:49.674 --> 39:50.902
It's Diane Dupres.

40:00.785 --> 40:01.877
Diane?

40:03.421 --> 40:07.221
Thomas,
I think I killed someone.

40:15.566 --> 40:17.329
I'll check the back.

40:21.172 --> 40:22.469
Diane?

40:41.993 --> 40:43.085
It's me.

40:50.201 --> 40:51.634
It's all right.

40:53.871 --> 40:56.203
It's all right.
Come here. Come on.

40:56.541 --> 40:57.769
It's all right.

40:59.143 --> 41:01.134
It's over.

41:09.454 --> 41:12.252
I turned after
closing the door,

41:12.323 --> 41:14.188
and he was standing there.

41:15.626 --> 41:17.025
And then

41:18.296 --> 41:19.786
I can't remember.

41:20.164 --> 41:22.689
Come on. Try.
What did he look like?

41:25.870 --> 41:29.135
He was tall.
Not as tall as you.

41:29.841 --> 41:31.502
He had a mustache,

41:32.343 --> 41:35.278
or a beard.
I can't be sure.

41:36.948 --> 41:38.848
Was he Hawaiian,
haole, Asian?

41:39.283 --> 41:40.750
I don't know.

41:48.559 --> 41:49.719
Did he hurt you?

41:50.895 --> 41:52.021
No.

41:53.131 --> 41:55.565
Do you remember
getting the gun?

41:55.700 --> 41:56.689
No.

41:56.868 --> 41:57.892
Firing it?

41:57.969 --> 41:59.800
No, I can't remember.

42:06.878 --> 42:08.778
I killed him, didn't I?

42:09.113 --> 42:10.341
Look. Come on.

42:11.048 --> 42:12.777
Whatever you did,

42:13.217 --> 42:15.082
you did it
to defend yourself.

42:18.055 --> 42:22.355
I can't find
any signs of blood,
tracks or bullet holes.

42:22.927 --> 42:26.624
However, I did find
these baggage stubs
outside the door there.

42:26.697 --> 42:27.823
Yours?

42:29.534 --> 42:32.765
No. I came in
on another airline.

42:33.838 --> 42:37.399
Well, perhaps the police
can use them to track
the culprit down.

42:37.475 --> 42:39.443
Must we notify the police?

42:39.510 --> 42:41.740
Diane, somebody
broke in here
and attacked you.

42:41.813 --> 42:44.805
But I can't even remember
what he looked like.

42:49.053 --> 42:52.147
Please, Thomas,
I don't want the publicity.

42:55.393 --> 42:58.362
That's why
I came to you for help
instead of the police.

43:00.031 --> 43:03.228
I've been through this
since I was five.

43:05.803 --> 43:08.431
The publicity just
brings out the crazies.

43:09.340 --> 43:13.071
The letters,
begging me for money,

43:13.845 --> 43:16.336
the dreams
foretelling my future,

43:17.381 --> 43:19.781
the offers of matrimony.

43:20.751 --> 43:23.686
Thomas, please don't make me
go through that,

43:26.757 --> 43:30.784
especially when they won't
do anything that you can't.

43:33.097 --> 43:34.394
She has a point.

43:35.066 --> 43:37.534
We can't even prove
anyone broke in here tonight.

43:38.569 --> 43:40.594
They'll simply file
the report away,

43:40.671 --> 43:43.902
but the media will
play it up because
of Miss Dupres' wealth.

43:44.775 --> 43:46.834
I'm not gonna let you
stay here alone.

43:48.045 --> 43:49.706
Then stay with me.

43:54.852 --> 43:58.151
Well, it's almost 1:00
and I still have

43:59.257 --> 44:00.690
things to do.

44:01.492 --> 44:04.427
If you don't mind, Magnum,
I'll take Mr. Masters' Ferrari

44:04.495 --> 44:06.554
and have one of the boys
drop it off in the morning.

44:06.631 --> 44:08.098
That'd be fine, Higgins.

44:09.767 --> 44:12.327
Miss Dupres, I'm quite sure
your shot did nothing more

44:12.403 --> 44:15.395
than give the blighter
a well-deserved fright.

44:16.007 --> 44:17.304
I hope not.

44:18.142 --> 44:19.336
Yes.

44:20.011 --> 44:22.809
Well, good night.

44:23.447 --> 44:24.880
Good night, Mr. Higgins.

44:25.483 --> 44:26.848
I'll walk you out.

44:33.791 --> 44:37.488
She is frightfully attractive,
in a vulnerable sort of way.

44:38.296 --> 44:40.093
I can see why
you're drawn to her.

44:42.266 --> 44:46.225
Look, old boy,
I couldn't find a trace
of forced entry

44:46.304 --> 44:48.272
or any tracks
around the house.

44:49.106 --> 44:51.301
Considering why
Diane hired you,

44:52.777 --> 44:55.041
you think it possible
that she imagined all this?

44:56.681 --> 44:58.148
I don't know.

45:00.351 --> 45:02.114
You look a bit bashed in.

45:02.186 --> 45:03.915
I suggest
a hot bath and toddy.

45:05.323 --> 45:06.950
You don't look
so hot yourself.

45:07.024 --> 45:08.150
I'm fine.

45:08.225 --> 45:10.090
You're going to Agatha's,
aren't you?

45:10.761 --> 45:12.422
It has to be done.

45:14.498 --> 45:17.194
Look, maybe I could
talk to her for you.

45:18.869 --> 45:21.303
That's very decent
of you, Magnum.

45:21.472 --> 45:23.565
But as Winston Churchill said,

45:23.641 --> 45:26.007
"A man must do
what a man must do."

45:27.411 --> 45:29.641
That's funny, I thought
John Wayne said that.

45:31.749 --> 45:33.740
If he did,
he got it from Winnie.

45:37.755 --> 45:39.120
Good night, Magnum.

45:39.790 --> 45:41.052
Good night, Higgins.

46:06.317 --> 46:08.285
<i>I couldn't shake</i>
<i>Higgins' suggestion</i>

46:08.352 --> 46:10.286
<i>that there might not</i>
<i>have been an intruder,</i>

46:10.354 --> 46:13.187
<i>that the whole episode</i>
<i>could have happened</i>
<i>in Diane's mind.</i>

46:13.691 --> 46:15.818
<i>It would explain why</i>
<i>I hadn't sensed anything</i>

46:15.893 --> 46:18.054
<i>while we were kissing</i>
<i>at the front door.</i>

46:19.497 --> 46:23.934
<i>I'd sensed Diane was coming,</i>
<i>that she was in trouble</i>
<i>when the dogs attacked.</i>

46:24.001 --> 46:27.664
<i>Why didn't I sense the danger</i>
<i>when her assailant was</i>
<i>only a few feet from me?</i>
