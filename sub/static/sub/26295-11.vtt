WEBVTT

00:06.310 --> 00:08.530
- Next.
- Yeah, can I get a--

00:08.573 --> 00:11.141
- Hey, there's a line.
- My shift starts in five.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.490
You understand.

00:12.534 --> 00:15.711
- We've all got places to be,
I'm next.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.930
- Cut me a break, all right?

00:17.974 --> 00:19.889
Can I get a double espresso?

00:19.932 --> 00:22.631
- I said I was next.
- What is your problem, man?

00:22.674 --> 00:23.675
- No problem.

00:23.719 --> 00:28.637
- Will, can I talk to you
a second?

00:28.680 --> 00:32.075
- What has gotten into you?
- Guy's a dick.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.338
- I'm concerned about you.

00:34.382 --> 00:35.861
- Why? Because I wouldn't let
him cut in front of me?

00:35.905 --> 00:37.515
- No, because you're not
acting like yourself.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.213
- Yeah, well, maybe
I'm a little upset

00:39.256 --> 00:41.693
about you throwing me out.
- I didn't throw you out.

00:41.737 --> 00:44.740
- Right.
The gun, the gun, the gun.

00:44.783 --> 00:48.831
- Will, I think you should
consider talking to someone.

00:48.874 --> 00:51.660
- I think you're having a hard
time processing all of it.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.270
Anybody would.

00:53.314 --> 00:55.055
- Nat, I don't want
to process it.

00:55.098 --> 00:56.882
I want to forget
it ever happened

00:56.926 --> 00:59.537
and move on with my life.

00:59.581 --> 01:02.801
Our life.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.375
- You were talking
in your sleep last night.

01:11.419 --> 01:13.943
- Really?
I haven't done that in a while.

01:13.986 --> 01:16.467
- Hmm.
- What was I saying?

01:16.511 --> 01:19.644
- Your usual.
Barking orders to subordinates.

01:19.688 --> 01:22.125
Sounds like me.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.345
- Give me the box!

01:24.388 --> 01:26.390
- Hey, get back here,
that's mine!

01:26.434 --> 01:29.828
You don't want that!

01:29.872 --> 01:32.440
- Hey, you okay?

01:36.574 --> 01:38.010
Get off me, man!

01:38.054 --> 01:39.186
- Stay down.

01:40.709 --> 01:41.753
- Ethan!

01:43.842 --> 01:45.757
- Get out of here.

01:47.150 --> 01:48.717
What happened?

01:48.760 --> 01:50.806
- He might be having
a heart attack.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.677
His pulse is through the roof.
I called an ambulance.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.375
- Here, here, here.
Let me do it. Let me do it.

01:54.418 --> 01:57.117
- Take deep breaths.
In and out. In and out.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.771
Petechiaes all over
his chest too.

02:12.306 --> 02:14.134
- Oh, my God.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.180
- Gangrene.

02:30.802 --> 02:33.022
- April, call general surgery
for a consult.

02:33.065 --> 02:34.980
He'll need to have
his leg debrided.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.939
Meantime, start him on fluids,
hang a gram of vanc,

02:36.982 --> 02:39.202
500 metronidazole,
order a CBC, CMP,

02:39.246 --> 02:41.248
blood cultures,
and chest X-ray.

02:41.291 --> 02:45.034
- Add a cardiac panel and EKG.
Need to rule out his heart.

02:45.077 --> 02:47.819
- Dr. Choi, do you want
a cardiac panel and EKG?

02:53.303 --> 02:54.696
- Yeah.

03:00.397 --> 03:01.920
Mags, any luck finding ID?

03:01.964 --> 03:03.966
- Not yet, and there was
nothing in his clothes.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.315
I got some lock cutters.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.361
Figured there might be
something inside.

03:07.404 --> 03:08.840
- Let me try.

03:17.675 --> 03:20.896
- He's a veteran.
- Yeah.

03:22.985 --> 03:26.293
Marks.
- Reginald Marks.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.690
- Oh.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.910
- Silver Star.
- Which one is that?

03:34.953 --> 03:37.434
- It's awarded for heroism
during combat.

03:39.175 --> 03:40.959
- Ah, Dr. Choi, CFD's coming in

03:41.003 --> 03:43.658
with semi-conscious
26-year-old.

03:43.701 --> 03:46.008
- Uh, go. I'll make a call
to the VA.

03:46.051 --> 03:47.792
Find him a housing placement.

03:47.836 --> 03:48.837
- Thanks.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.491
- All right, I got this.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.104
I'm sure it's just
my asthma acting up.

03:55.147 --> 03:58.020
It happened with the last
pregnancy too.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.935
- Is this your second?
- Yep.

03:59.978 --> 04:02.503
Double the fun this time.
Twins.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.200
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.508
But actually, they're not mine.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.423
I'm a surrogate.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.210
- Usually, Nate and Stephanie,
the twins' biological parents,

04:14.254 --> 04:16.212
come with me
to all my doctor's visits,

04:16.256 --> 04:19.041
but I didn't want to panic them
over nothing.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.869
- Yeah, I hear
some scattered wheezes.

04:20.912 --> 04:22.218
I think you're right.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.524
Uterus is compressing
the lungs,

04:23.567 --> 04:25.221
exacerbating your asthma.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.920
Let's get a Med Neb and 40 mg
of IV methylprednisolone.

04:28.964 --> 04:31.967
Well, since you're here...
- Ultrasound?

04:32.010 --> 04:34.143
- This isn't your first rodeo.

04:34.186 --> 04:38.060
- Whoo. Baby boy is doing
somersaults today.

04:38.103 --> 04:40.845
Probably the salsa I had
with my eggs.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.152
Spicy foods always
get 'em moving.

04:43.195 --> 04:46.286
Sister on the other hand,
hardly ever kicks.

04:49.506 --> 04:52.596
- Celine, have you had
your anatomy ultrasound yet?

04:52.640 --> 04:54.424
- No, it's for next week.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.081
Is something wrong?

04:59.124 --> 05:01.866
- The male fetus's
amniotic fluid is elevated.

05:01.910 --> 05:04.565
But that can happen with twins.
I just--

05:04.608 --> 05:06.306
I'd like to get a better
picture of what's going on.

05:06.349 --> 05:08.917
- Well, should I call
Nate and Stephanie?

05:08.960 --> 05:11.354
- I think that'd be
a good idea.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.490
- Just take these three.
- Yep.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.056
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.667
- Will still crashing
at his brother's?

05:19.710 --> 05:21.973
- Mm-hmm.

05:22.017 --> 05:23.279
- How long?

05:23.323 --> 05:24.759
- He can come home
whenever he wants.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.108
Just not with that gun.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.545
- He's been through hell.
- I get that.

05:28.589 --> 05:31.374
- He just needs time to get
reacclimated to his old life.

05:31.418 --> 05:34.943
- I hope so.
I just wish he'd let me in.

05:34.986 --> 05:37.162
- He'll come around.

05:39.861 --> 05:40.862
Mr. Davis.

05:40.905 --> 05:42.342
Hello.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.692
- Hey, Phillip.
- Dr. Manning.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.737
- How's little Sophie doing?

05:46.781 --> 05:50.741
- She's good, she's good, um,
they say that we can, uh--

05:50.785 --> 05:53.353
that I can take her home soon.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.746
I'm so glad to hear that.
- Me too.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.182
- I'm so sorry, Dr. Manning.
Heads up.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.141
Ambo is in, treatment 6.
- Okay.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.143
- Sorry about that.
- I'm sorry, um...

06:01.186 --> 06:03.972
It was good to see you.
- You too. Yeah.

06:06.017 --> 06:08.106
- Get the hell away from me!

06:08.150 --> 06:10.544
- Good Samaritan found her
wandering, called 911.

06:10.587 --> 06:13.547
Fran Mooney, 83-year-old female
with Alzheimer's disease.

06:13.590 --> 06:16.550
BP is 138 over 90.
- I said let me go!

06:16.593 --> 06:18.116
- She was able
to tell you all that?

06:18.160 --> 06:19.466
- Medical alert bracelet.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.032
Called the emergency contact
on the back.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.991
Daughter should be here
any second.

06:23.034 --> 06:25.341
- Okay. Uh, Dr. Charles,
can I grab you?

06:25.385 --> 06:29.998
All right, let's sheet
transfer on my count.

06:30.041 --> 06:34.219
Ready. One, two, three.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.093
Milty? Milty.

06:38.136 --> 06:40.182
Tell these people
to get the hell away from me!

06:40.225 --> 06:42.880
- I'm actually Dr. Charles,
but--but could you tell me

06:42.924 --> 06:44.665
a little bit more
about Milty?

06:44.708 --> 06:47.319
- Milton was her husband.

06:47.363 --> 06:50.410
- Who the hell are you?
- Lungs are clear.

06:50.453 --> 06:53.717
- Mom, it's me.
It's Alana.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.502
- Don't touch me!

06:55.545 --> 06:58.026
- 2.5 haloperidol IM.

06:58.069 --> 06:59.767
Help calm her down
a little bit.

06:59.810 --> 07:02.683
- I'm so sorry, this--this is
the third time this month

07:02.726 --> 07:04.293
she's wandered.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.077
I-I don't know how
she keeps getting out.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.862
I always lock the door.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.603
- You notice any other changes
in her--

07:09.646 --> 07:11.213
her general disposition?

07:11.256 --> 07:15.260
- Uh, she's--she's more
agitated than usual,

07:15.304 --> 07:17.915
and she's--she's lost
some weight too.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.569
- All right, well,
we'll run some labs

07:19.613 --> 07:22.529
and see if there's anything
out of the ordinary, okay?

07:22.572 --> 07:24.182
- Okay.

07:24.226 --> 07:26.707
- Might just have to
adjust her meds a bit.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.317
- Thank you.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.630
- Long night?

07:36.673 --> 07:38.588
- Exceptionally long.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.590
- Why don't you head over
to my place?

07:40.634 --> 07:43.158
The new mattress just got
delivered this morning.

07:43.201 --> 07:44.725
- Ah. Don't you think
that's something

07:44.768 --> 07:47.075
we ought to break in together?

07:47.118 --> 07:49.947
- I like where your head's at.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.558
- So listen, we haven't
really, um,

07:51.601 --> 07:54.648
we haven't talked about
what happened at the gala.

07:54.691 --> 07:55.953
Connor...

07:55.997 --> 07:57.738
What Cornelius told people...

07:57.781 --> 07:59.566
- It was vintage my father.

07:59.609 --> 08:02.525
He's spreading lies and using
you to get under my skin.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.484
Look, he's a prick.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.050
- Bekker. Good.

08:06.094 --> 08:07.748
There was a huge pileup
on the highway near East Mercy.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.314
I had to send two surgeons
over there to assist.

08:09.358 --> 08:10.620
Do you mind sticking around
the ED?

08:10.664 --> 08:12.579
We could really use
the extra hand.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.147
So much for sleep. Sure.

08:16.191 --> 08:18.193
- You hold onto those.

08:20.630 --> 08:24.155
- You two a thing?
- What's it to you?

08:24.199 --> 08:26.897
- Well, give me a heads-up
when she dumps you.

08:26.941 --> 08:29.204
- Rhodes, head vs. auto,
trauma three.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.206
- You got it. Courtney?

08:31.249 --> 08:33.817
- Leslie Taylor,
37-year-old female.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.297
Car struck her
in the crosswalk.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.429
GCS 12, heart rate 130.

08:37.473 --> 08:38.866
BP 86 over palp.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.998
- Leslie, I'm Dr. Rhodes,
do you know where you're at?

08:41.042 --> 08:42.957
- Uh, was there an accident?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.133
- You were hit by a car,
but now you're in the hospital.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.918
- What happened?
Was I in an accident?

08:47.962 --> 08:49.659
- She lose consciousness
at any point?

08:49.703 --> 08:50.965
- Bystander said she was out

08:51.008 --> 08:52.575
for a few minutes
after it happened.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.316
Couldn't get anything coherent
from her in the ambo.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.100
- All right.
Let's get her over on my count.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.841
One, two, three.

08:57.885 --> 09:01.105
- There we go.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.242
Breath sounds clear and present
bilaterally.

09:07.285 --> 09:10.158
- Was I in an accident?
- Maggie filled me in.

09:10.201 --> 09:11.333
I'll clear the C-spine?

09:11.376 --> 09:13.161
- Can't. She's perseverating.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.684
You gotta wait
until she's lucid.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.817
Let's do a fast scan.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.819
- She's jaundiced.
- Yeah.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.516
Maggie!
- Yeah.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.518
Check to see if the patient's
in the system.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.433
Look for anything that would
account for the jaundice.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.348
- Just pulled up her records.

09:26.391 --> 09:28.306
- She's got a lot of blood
in her belly.

09:28.350 --> 09:30.308
- All right, let's give her
a liter of fluid,

09:30.352 --> 09:32.006
2 units of plasma,
2 units of blood.

09:32.049 --> 09:34.661
Once her pressure stabilizes,
we're gonna move her to CT.

09:34.704 --> 09:35.966
- Yes, Doctor.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.141
- Jaundice is from
liver disease.

09:37.185 --> 09:38.752
She's on the list.

09:38.795 --> 09:41.363
- Was I in an accident?
- If her liver took the hit--

09:41.406 --> 09:43.713
- She doesn't have much time.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.062
- Yeah.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.330
- Dr. Halstead.

09:52.374 --> 09:54.681
This is Nate and Stephanie
Addison, the twins' parents.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.378
- Hi.
- Hi there.

09:56.421 --> 09:57.945
- Hi.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.555
- I'm afraid I have
some difficult news.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.644
- What's wrong?

10:01.688 --> 10:03.646
The male fetus has something

10:03.690 --> 10:06.388
called a congenital
diaphragmatic hernia.

10:06.431 --> 10:09.652
His abdominal organs
have migrated into his chest

10:09.696 --> 10:12.612
through a hole
in his diaphragm.

10:12.655 --> 10:15.919
- Oh, my God.
- It's treatable, right?

10:15.963 --> 10:20.576
- There are surgical options
post-birth, but...

10:20.620 --> 10:21.795
due to the severity
of his case,

10:21.838 --> 10:24.406
his prognosis is poor.

10:27.191 --> 10:30.891
And unfortunately,
that is not all.

10:30.934 --> 10:35.417
The increased fluid
is compressing the female twin,

10:35.460 --> 10:36.810
jeopardizing her growth.

10:36.853 --> 10:39.421
- So you're saying
she's in trouble too?

10:39.464 --> 10:42.163
- There has to be something
you can do.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.252
- Yeah.

10:45.819 --> 10:48.735
Selectively reducing
the male fetus

10:48.778 --> 10:51.128
would give her
the best chance of survival.

10:51.172 --> 10:54.218
- You mean--
- Lose him.

10:55.785 --> 10:58.701
- I am so sorry.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.356
- Is there a chance
things could stabilize

11:01.399 --> 11:03.663
on their own if we just wait?

11:03.706 --> 11:07.101
- It's possible,
but in all likelihood,

11:07.144 --> 11:09.407
the fluid will continue
to build,

11:09.451 --> 11:11.453
hindering her lung development.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.498
- Oh! Oh, no.

11:15.457 --> 11:18.416
- But the earlier we intervene,
the better.

11:29.776 --> 11:33.475
- Dr. Charles.
I got Fran Mooney's labs back.

11:33.518 --> 11:36.957
Her TSH is really low,
so I ran some more tests.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.176
It's likely due to an overdose
of her thyroid medication.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.352
- Huh.
- Yeah, so I'm gonna put her

11:41.396 --> 11:44.007
on beta blockers and start
detoxing her with charcoal.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.226
- Let me--let me talk
to the daughter,

11:45.269 --> 11:46.706
find out who's in charge
of the meds.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.185
- Okay.

11:49.883 --> 11:52.494
- Your EKG and labs
were negative.

11:52.537 --> 11:53.887
You didn't have a heart attack.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.803
Have you ever had chest pain
like that before?

11:56.846 --> 11:58.543
- Yeah, I have.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.197
- Panic attacks?

12:00.241 --> 12:01.764
- Yeah.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.810
- When I got back
from my first tour,

12:03.853 --> 12:05.725
I started talking in my sleep.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.163
Shouted out orders, mostly.

12:09.206 --> 12:12.514
It was like every night,
I went back to Afghanistan.

12:12.557 --> 12:14.908
- Army?
- Navy.

12:14.951 --> 12:17.693
Squid.

12:19.390 --> 12:23.003
Reservist now.
Vicki's active duty.

12:23.046 --> 12:25.396
- How long did you serve,
Reginald?

12:25.440 --> 12:27.050
- Reggie, please.

12:27.094 --> 12:29.009
I was 12 years in the Corps.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.706
I made it all the way
up to Gunny.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.360
- Hmm.

12:32.403 --> 12:36.930
- Three tours in Iraq,
two in Afghanistan.

12:36.973 --> 12:39.889
The last tour was the roughest.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.849
I had an IED that took my leg.

12:42.892 --> 12:45.199
Took three of my marines
with it.

12:47.897 --> 12:51.074
- Sorry, man.

12:51.118 --> 12:54.077
- Sorry to interrupt.
Dr. Choi, can I talk to you?

12:54.121 --> 12:55.731
- Yeah.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.385
Be right back.

13:00.344 --> 13:03.043
- Got the rest
of Reggie's labs back.

13:03.086 --> 13:07.569
White count is 18,000.
His platelets...

13:09.440 --> 13:11.529
- His platelets are what?

13:11.573 --> 13:13.705
- I'm sorry, I can't share
test results with someone

13:13.749 --> 13:15.403
who's not on staff
at the hospital.

13:16.883 --> 13:20.234
- Uh, you know, I'll, uh,
I'll head back to the VA.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.845
I'll pick you up at 6:00.
- Yeah.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.326
- Bye, April.
- Bye.

13:25.369 --> 13:29.330
His platelets are really low.
30,000.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.898
- He's got thrombocytopenia.
Guy can't catch a break.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.073
- Puts him at risk
for bleeding.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.335
- Page hematology
for a consult.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.554
- Okay.
- W-w-wait a second.

13:36.598 --> 13:39.253
What's with the attitude?
- What do you mean?

13:39.296 --> 13:41.603
- Why are you giving Vicki
a hard time?

13:41.646 --> 13:43.953
- I was just protecting
patient confidentiality.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.476
Following the rules.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.612
- Dr. Halstead?

13:52.657 --> 13:56.226
- We've decided that, um...

13:56.270 --> 13:59.273
- Celine will have
the procedure.

13:59.316 --> 14:01.623
We've tried for six years
to have a child.

14:01.666 --> 14:05.366
These are our last two embryos.

14:05.409 --> 14:08.717
- We just can't risk
losing both of them.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.459
- I'll let obstetrics know.

14:18.683 --> 14:19.946
- I give my mom her pills,

14:19.989 --> 14:22.296
but I only give her one tablet
every morning.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.080
That's what
the doctor prescribed.

14:24.124 --> 14:26.604
- You mind me asking, where--
where are the meds kept?

14:26.648 --> 14:28.650
Are they locked away, or...

14:28.693 --> 14:31.827
- I came as soon as I could.
Had to leave a client meeting.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.524
- This is my husband, Patrick.

14:33.568 --> 14:36.310
Patrick, this is Dr.,
um, sorry, remind me?

14:36.353 --> 14:38.007
- Dr. Charles.
Nice to meet ya.

14:38.051 --> 14:40.923
- They think Mom overdosed
on her thyroid medication,

14:40.967 --> 14:42.359
but I don't see how.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.144
- Maybe Fran got into
the pills?

14:44.187 --> 14:46.102
- No, of course not.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.669
She can't even button
her own shirt.

14:47.712 --> 14:50.672
There's no way she could
open a pill bottle herself.

14:50.715 --> 14:53.109
- She unlocked the front door.

14:53.153 --> 14:57.809
- You know...
when Fran was first diagnosed,

14:57.853 --> 15:01.509
she begged Alana
to euthanize her.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.728
She couldn't stand the thought
of deteriorating.

15:03.772 --> 15:07.471
- But she's not lucid enough
to attempt suicide.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.693
Is she?

15:11.736 --> 15:14.696
- Periods of lucidity aren't
uncommon with Alzheimer's,

15:14.739 --> 15:18.395
and, you know, the increased
agitation, the weight loss,

15:18.439 --> 15:22.356
I mean, those both, they could
be signs of depression.

15:22.399 --> 15:23.574
- I told you.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.533
Your mother shouldn't
be living with us.

15:25.576 --> 15:28.101
- We are not having
this conversation right now.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.711
- Why don't you two
take a break?

15:29.754 --> 15:33.106
Go grab a cup of coffee.
Let me have a chat with Fran.

15:33.149 --> 15:36.152
Okay?
- You go ahead.

15:36.196 --> 15:39.112
I have to respond
to some client emails.

15:50.427 --> 15:53.256
- Celine, you all right?
- He just kicked.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.042
I know it's him,
he's always on the right.

16:04.789 --> 16:07.967
Wait, wait. Stop.
- What is it?

16:08.010 --> 16:10.665
- I can't do this.
- What?

16:10.708 --> 16:13.668
- You heard Dr. Halstead.
We don't have a choice.

16:13.711 --> 16:16.149
- He said there's a chance
things could stabilize.

16:16.192 --> 16:20.936
- Celine, we can't risk
losing both of our babies.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.677
- How about we talk this out--

16:22.720 --> 16:25.549
- I'm sorry, but I'm not
willing to let him go.

16:28.074 --> 16:32.034
I can't do the procedure.
I just can't.

16:42.218 --> 16:45.047
- Okay, here's the clause
in the surrogacy contract.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.180
The parents have the right to
request a selective reduction

16:47.223 --> 16:48.746
for any medical reason.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.835
- And the surrogate agreed
to defer to their wishes?

16:50.879 --> 16:53.055
- She signed the contract.

16:53.099 --> 16:55.623
- But she has since, very
emphatically, changed her mind.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.668
- Okay, well, that's the funny
thing about contracts.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.540
They don't really care
if you change your mind.

16:59.583 --> 17:00.889
- Well, I don't care if
she signed the thing in blood.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.325
Celine is not
a human incubator.

17:02.369 --> 17:03.457
I won't force a procedure
on her

17:03.500 --> 17:05.067
without her explicit consent.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.069
- You're not gonna do
anything at all, Dr. Halstead.

17:07.113 --> 17:11.073
This is a legal matter now.
Let the lawyers hash it out.

17:15.817 --> 17:18.559
- Waiting room's jumping.
What's going on?

17:18.602 --> 17:20.387
- Mass casualty
over at East Mercy.

17:20.430 --> 17:21.910
They went on bypass
about an hour ago.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.346
Started diverting
patients here.

17:23.390 --> 17:25.044
- Hi.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.697
Uh, I think my sister's here,
Leslie Taylor.

17:26.741 --> 17:27.959
She was hit by a car.

17:28.003 --> 17:29.961
- Yes, I'm the nurse
who left the message

17:30.005 --> 17:32.094
but I'm taking that
you're not Paul Taylor?

17:32.138 --> 17:37.143
- No, that's Leslie's husband.
Ex-husband. He called me.

17:37.186 --> 17:39.449
- Okay, just give me a second.
I'll get her doctor.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.234
- Okay.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.626
- Dr. Choi!

17:42.670 --> 17:44.237
I need you.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.069
- BP's in the toilet.
- Heart rate's 130.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.549
- Must be an upper GI bleed.
- He's got thrombocytopenia.

17:52.593 --> 17:53.855
He won't be able
to make a clot.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.335
- He needs blood
and platelets now.

17:55.378 --> 17:56.814
Trigger the MTP,
I'm gonna intubate.

17:56.858 --> 17:59.861
20 etomidate, 100 of sux,
and grab me an EGD scope.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.558
Gotta find the source
of the bleed.

18:07.782 --> 18:10.698
- The impact from the accident
destroyed the right lobe

18:10.741 --> 18:12.613
of Leslie's liver.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.267
We will be able to fix it
for now,

18:14.310 --> 18:16.660
but she's gonna need
a new liver urgently,

18:16.704 --> 18:19.010
and because of her condition,
she's gonna move up

18:19.054 --> 18:21.274
the transplant list
from her previous status.

18:21.317 --> 18:24.755
- Wait, previous status?
What--what do you mean?

18:24.799 --> 18:26.279
- Leslie's already on
the transplant list.

18:26.322 --> 18:27.845
You didn't know?

18:27.889 --> 18:29.891
- Right, right.
Of course I did.

18:29.934 --> 18:33.155
I'm sorry.
There's just a lot to take in.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.157
You were saying?

18:35.201 --> 18:37.377
- So if Leslie doesn't get
a new liver

18:37.420 --> 18:39.553
in the next few days...

18:39.596 --> 18:42.773
- Oh, God.
- There is another option.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.297
A living donor.

18:44.340 --> 18:47.300
Someone can donate
a lobe of their liver.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.606
- Really?

18:49.650 --> 18:51.304
I'll donate then.
What do I need to do?

18:51.347 --> 18:53.262
- First of all, you should know

18:53.306 --> 18:55.960
that there can be complications
for the donor that--

18:56.004 --> 18:57.527
- I don't care.

18:57.571 --> 19:00.051
- Is there anybody that you
need to talk to about this?

19:00.095 --> 19:03.577
- No. There's no...

19:03.620 --> 19:07.755
I need to do this
for my sister, Dr. Rhodes.

19:07.798 --> 19:11.672
- Okay. We'll get you tested
right away.

19:13.543 --> 19:16.851
- Fran, could you open
this bottle,

19:16.894 --> 19:20.376
take out a pill,
and hand it to me?

19:20.420 --> 19:22.726
Could you do that?

19:32.736 --> 19:34.477
- You do it, Milty.

19:34.521 --> 19:38.220
- Just pull down the tab
and press.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.664
- She's in A-fib with RVR.

19:47.708 --> 19:48.709
Give me 10 of diltiazem.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.319
- Yes, ma'am.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.630
Meds are in.

19:58.936 --> 20:01.809
- She's back in normal
sinus rhythm.

20:01.852 --> 20:03.376
It's odd that she flipped
into A-fib.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.247
We've already treated
her hyperthyroidism.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.728
I'm gonna order an echo,
see what's going on.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.164
- Yeah, good idea.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.383
But, um,

20:10.426 --> 20:11.732
I think we might be dealing

20:11.775 --> 20:14.082
with more than just
an overdose here.

20:19.609 --> 20:20.741
- April, call the blood bank.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.438
We're gonna need
more platelets.

20:22.482 --> 20:24.745
Give the second dose of TXA.

20:24.788 --> 20:26.225
That's it.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.661
That's where
he's bleeding from.

20:27.704 --> 20:28.749
Epinephrine injector.

20:34.885 --> 20:37.323
Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

20:40.151 --> 20:44.112
There we go.
I think we got it.

20:44.155 --> 20:46.070
- Dr. Choi.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.421
- Damn it.
It's not clotting.

20:48.464 --> 20:51.075
- They won't allocate
any more platelets for Reggie.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.294
- What? Why?

20:52.338 --> 20:53.513
- 'Cause of the MCI
at East Mercy.

20:53.556 --> 20:54.949
There's a citywide shortage.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.603
Blood bank's been mandated
to dispense

20:56.646 --> 20:57.952
only to patients
who will benefit.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.127
- Go down there in person
and tell them

20:59.170 --> 21:00.389
the order's coming from me.

21:00.433 --> 21:01.608
Do not take no for an answer.

21:01.651 --> 21:02.957
- We've given him
multiple doses.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.088
It is not working.

21:04.132 --> 21:05.568
- I didn't ask
for your opinion.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.701
Do it now,
or I'll get someone who will.

21:11.618 --> 21:12.880
- There's more.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.185
I want to make sure
you understand

21:14.229 --> 21:16.275
you're in clear breach
of contract.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.842
- I'm sorry but I think we
should just wait and see

21:18.886 --> 21:20.279
if things stabilize
on their own.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.803
- With all due respect,
there is no we.

21:22.846 --> 21:25.806
It's the Addisons' decision
and theirs alone.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.242
- It's her body.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.678
- That doesn't give her
the right

21:28.722 --> 21:30.811
to hold my clients'
fetuses hostage.

21:30.854 --> 21:34.118
- That's not my intention.
- Listen.

21:34.162 --> 21:36.164
I'd hate to have to
bring this to trial

21:36.207 --> 21:38.993
because if I do,
you'll be facing

21:39.036 --> 21:41.691
severe legal and financial
ramifications.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.345
- Let's take it down
a notch, okay?

21:43.389 --> 21:45.347
You're not gonna force her hand
with intimidation

21:45.391 --> 21:46.696
and scare tactics.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.437
- Why don't you stay
in your lane, Doctor?

21:48.481 --> 21:49.482
This doesn't concern you.

21:49.525 --> 21:51.048
- Oh, no, it does concern me,

21:51.092 --> 21:52.485
because you're upsetting
my patient.

21:52.528 --> 21:53.790
You need to leave.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.836
- Our lawyer is not
going anywhere

21:55.879 --> 21:57.446
until we figure this out.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.537
- Celine,
do you want her to leave?

22:01.581 --> 22:03.670
- Excuse me.

22:03.713 --> 22:05.193
I'm Sharon Goodwin,

22:05.236 --> 22:07.064
Director
of Patient Medical Services.

22:07.108 --> 22:09.197
Is there anything
I could help you sort out?

22:09.240 --> 22:10.329
- Yes.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.461
We'd--we'd like
a different doctor.

22:12.505 --> 22:15.508
Dr. Halstead
is clearly biased against us.

22:15.551 --> 22:18.032
- That's not up to you.
I'm Celine's doctor.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.947
Only she can make
that decision.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.862
- Dr. Halstead,
can I speak to you outside?

22:21.905 --> 22:23.516
- Ms. Goodwin--
- Now.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.791
- You're wrong, Dr. Halstead.

22:37.834 --> 22:40.184
You know who else
can make that decision?

22:40.228 --> 22:41.490
Me.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.971
And if the Addisons aren't
comfortable with you--

22:44.014 --> 22:47.278
- You're benching me?
- I'm reassigning the case.

22:47.322 --> 22:49.846
Yes.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.587
- Unbelievable.

22:55.243 --> 22:57.419
- When was
the prescription filled?

22:57.463 --> 22:59.073
- I-I don't remember.

22:59.116 --> 23:01.510
I think Patrick picked up
the last refill.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.817
- It was about a month ago.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.733
- No good?

23:06.776 --> 23:08.430
- A little sweeter than I like.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.867
- Can I get you another cup?
- No, no. It's fine.

23:12.303 --> 23:13.827
Okay, so there's 20 pills left,

23:13.870 --> 23:16.786
and the quantity
of the prescription was 90.

23:17.961 --> 23:20.486
- Sorry, I'm terrible at math.
- It's okay.

23:20.529 --> 23:22.401
Um, there should be
60 pills remaining,

23:22.444 --> 23:25.795
which means there's 40 pills
unaccounted for.

23:25.839 --> 23:28.232
- You think my mom
took 40 pills?

23:28.276 --> 23:29.843
- No, no, if she took
that many pills at once,

23:29.886 --> 23:32.019
she would be in a coma.

23:32.062 --> 23:34.761
- The overdosing has to be
taking place over time,

23:34.804 --> 23:37.111
like, a little bit each day.

23:37.154 --> 23:39.113
And based on my evaluation,

23:39.156 --> 23:40.462
your mom doesn't have
the cognition

23:40.506 --> 23:42.464
to be able to carry out
a repetitive,

23:42.508 --> 23:45.119
multistep task anyway.

23:45.162 --> 23:48.296
- Wait, you think someone's
doing this to her?

23:48.339 --> 23:51.212
- Is there anybody who comes
and goes from your home?

23:51.255 --> 23:53.867
A part-time caregiver or...

23:53.910 --> 23:55.956
- There was for a bit,
but she quit months ago.

23:55.999 --> 24:00.395
And the only people with access
to my mom's pills are me and...

24:00.439 --> 24:02.963
my husband.

24:11.188 --> 24:14.757
- What if... I don't get
a liver in time?

24:14.801 --> 24:20.415
- Well, the good news is that
we found you a donor already.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.895
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

24:21.938 --> 24:23.505
We tested your sister.
Turns out--

24:23.549 --> 24:26.682
- No, no. Wait, my sister?

24:26.726 --> 24:28.945
Denise?
- Yeah.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.991
- How did she know I was here?

24:35.386 --> 24:37.867
- Hi, Leslie.

24:37.911 --> 24:39.913
- What are you doing here?

24:39.956 --> 24:41.523
- Leslie, please.

24:41.567 --> 24:45.701
- No, I told you
to stay away from me.

24:45.745 --> 24:48.487
- I-I just want to help you.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.358
- I don't want your help.

24:50.401 --> 24:52.491
- Leslie, hear me out.
- Get out!

24:52.534 --> 24:54.014
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:55.624 --> 24:57.713
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Here, let's step outside.

24:57.757 --> 24:59.672
- Um, take a deep breath.

24:59.715 --> 25:02.675
- Deep breath, that's it.

25:05.155 --> 25:06.940
Look, Leslie, I don't know
what happened

25:06.983 --> 25:09.769
between you and your sister,
but she...

25:11.858 --> 25:13.860
- I'll tell you what happened.

25:16.079 --> 25:18.908
She killed my little girl.

25:26.916 --> 25:29.397
- Mary was only
three years old.

25:29.440 --> 25:33.270
Denise... put her to bed.

25:34.576 --> 25:37.536
Went downstairs,

25:37.579 --> 25:40.800
lit her bong,

25:40.843 --> 25:44.064
and smoked herself
into oblivion.

25:46.632 --> 25:51.811
When she woke up,
the house was in flames.

25:51.854 --> 25:54.857
She managed to get herself out,

25:54.901 --> 26:01.124
but she was too stoned
to remember...

26:01.168 --> 26:02.865
that Mary...

26:04.867 --> 26:06.565
My Mary...

26:08.479 --> 26:11.091
Was still upstairs.

26:16.705 --> 26:22.276
I won't accept anything
from her.

26:25.714 --> 26:28.412
I'd rather die.

26:35.768 --> 26:38.466
- That's all you can do.

26:40.424 --> 26:41.730
I asked her to stick around,

26:41.774 --> 26:44.646
see if we can get Leslie
to change her mind.

26:44.690 --> 26:47.257
Denise doesn't think
she'll budge.

26:47.301 --> 26:50.086
- Yeah, no,
she was quite adamant.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.393
I mean...

26:52.436 --> 26:54.003
I can understand.

26:54.047 --> 26:57.093
- Oh, Connor, she's cheating
herself out of life to what?

26:57.137 --> 26:58.442
Punish her sister?

26:58.486 --> 27:00.096
Denise has already done that
to herself.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.445
Every day of her life,

27:01.489 --> 27:02.925
she has to reckon
with what happened.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.624
- What do you mean,
with what she did?

27:05.667 --> 27:07.190
- She's not
shirking responsibility.

27:07.234 --> 27:08.670
The opposite.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.280
That's why she's so desperate
to make amends.

27:10.324 --> 27:13.457
- Well, look, regardless,
we can't force Leslie

27:13.501 --> 27:15.938
to accept Denise's liver.

27:15.982 --> 27:18.462
- No. We just have to stand by
and watch her die.

27:18.506 --> 27:19.942
We both know the likelihood

27:19.986 --> 27:22.510
of another liver coming through
in time is slim.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.512
She's got days at most.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.950
- I'm gonna reach out
to the hospital's PR team,

27:27.994 --> 27:31.650
get them to put out an urgent
public appeal for a donor.

27:34.435 --> 27:36.176
What?
- Nothing.

27:36.219 --> 27:38.308
No, that's a good idea.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.147
- Where are the platelets?
- He's not getting any more.

27:51.191 --> 27:52.714
They have to be conserved
for patients

27:52.758 --> 27:54.150
who have an actual shot
at survival.

27:54.194 --> 27:56.109
He has a shot.
Once the meds kick in,

27:56.152 --> 27:58.024
the platelets start holding,
we can get him up to surgery.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.765
- We both know
that is not gonna happen.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.505
We take him up to the OR,
he's gonna bleed out--

28:01.549 --> 28:02.811
- You have no right
to deny him treatment.

28:02.855 --> 28:05.509
- Dr. Choi?

28:07.816 --> 28:09.339
He's bleeding from his IV too.

28:09.383 --> 28:10.776
- He's in V-fib. No pulse.

28:10.819 --> 28:13.126
April, charge to 200.
Doris, start bagging.

28:16.738 --> 28:19.132
- Charging.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.742
Charged.
- Clear.

28:23.049 --> 28:25.616
- Dr. Choi.
- Amp of epi.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.357
Charging to 200.

28:29.011 --> 28:30.056
Clear.

28:31.579 --> 28:32.536
Doris?

28:34.103 --> 28:36.062
- He's asystolic.
- Another amp of epi.

28:36.105 --> 28:38.325
- Dr. Choi, enough!
- Another amp of epi!

28:40.893 --> 28:43.722
Give him an amp of bicarb
and an amp of calcium.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.289
- On it.
- Come on.

28:49.162 --> 28:50.293
Come on.

29:02.958 --> 29:05.308
Time of death, 16:48.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.705
- The Addisons aren't speaking
to me

29:10.749 --> 29:12.533
except through their lawyer.

29:12.576 --> 29:14.230
I don't know what to do.

29:14.274 --> 29:19.235
I can't afford to be in some
long, drawn-out legal battle.

29:19.279 --> 29:22.673
Maybe I should just respect
their wishes.

29:22.717 --> 29:26.025
But I know
they don't want this either.

29:26.068 --> 29:30.246
- That's why I'm here.
I may have found another way.

29:30.290 --> 29:33.206
It's an investigational
procedure called

29:33.249 --> 29:34.860
fetal tracheal occlusion.

29:34.903 --> 29:38.602
If successful, it would allow
the twins to reach viability.

29:38.646 --> 29:39.995
I mean, it could even help
improve

29:40.039 --> 29:43.520
the male fetus' lung function.

29:43.564 --> 29:44.739
Hold on, though.

29:46.306 --> 29:49.831
General anesthesia
always carries risks.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.311
And because of your asthma,

29:51.354 --> 29:53.879
the potential complications
are increased.

29:56.055 --> 29:59.101
You would be putting yourself
on the line.

30:03.932 --> 30:06.413
- I know they're not mine.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.633
And when it's time
to hand them over,

30:09.677 --> 30:11.679
I'll be happy to,
'cause they know

30:11.722 --> 30:13.463
how loved and wanted they are.

30:16.075 --> 30:18.860
But while they're still inside
my body,

30:18.904 --> 30:21.602
while their lives depend on me,

30:21.645 --> 30:24.300
I have to do
what I think is best.

30:29.523 --> 30:31.699
I want to do it, Dr. Halstead.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.486
- This is absurd.

30:36.530 --> 30:39.402
I can't believe that you think
I would do something like this!

30:39.446 --> 30:41.970
- I don't know what to think.

30:42.014 --> 30:44.494
I know you resented my mom
moving in with us.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.888
The imposition on our lives.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.324
- So you think
I'm trying to kill her?

30:48.368 --> 30:49.891
- No one's accusing you
of anything.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.327
- Yes, you are.

30:51.371 --> 30:53.503
- We're just trying to
understand how this happened.

30:57.203 --> 31:02.425
- Too sweet? Your coffee.
Is your coffee too sweet?

31:02.469 --> 31:03.687
- Yeah.

31:05.733 --> 31:07.343
Why?

31:07.387 --> 31:09.868
- Alana, I'd like you
to get an MRI.

31:13.262 --> 31:15.395
- April, that man risked
his life for all of us.

31:15.438 --> 31:17.527
We owed it to him to do
everything we possibly could.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.094
- Yeah, but we did, Ethan.

31:19.138 --> 31:20.879
The situation
had become futile,

31:20.922 --> 31:22.141
you just couldn't see it.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.012
- So you had to go snitch
to Lanik?

31:24.056 --> 31:25.492
- I was following
the chain of command.

31:25.535 --> 31:27.189
- Funny, you're such a stickler
for the rules

31:27.233 --> 31:28.930
when they align
with your agenda.

31:28.974 --> 31:31.585
- My only agenda is the welfare
of my patients.

31:31.628 --> 31:32.891
- Then you wouldn't
have interfered

31:32.934 --> 31:34.762
when I was trying
to save Reggie's life.

31:34.805 --> 31:36.285
Did you go to Lanik
to get back at me?

31:36.329 --> 31:37.721
- Get back at you?

31:37.765 --> 31:39.288
- You made it very clear
you resent Vicki.

31:39.332 --> 31:41.334
- Are you serious?

31:41.377 --> 31:44.641
You think I would jeopardize
a patient to get even with you?

31:47.035 --> 31:50.734
- You two need to take this
outside right now.

31:50.778 --> 31:51.866
You're disturbing my ED.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.216
- Sorry, Maggie.

31:54.260 --> 31:55.217
We're done.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.449
- Alana.

32:09.492 --> 32:11.364
We have the results
of your MRI,

32:11.407 --> 32:13.018
and we were just wondering
if we could discuss--

32:13.061 --> 32:14.410
- Please, just--
just tell me.

32:14.454 --> 32:17.805
- Your MRI shows atrophy
to the hippocampus.

32:17.848 --> 32:21.722
It's the area of your brain
associated with memory.

32:21.765 --> 32:23.854
- Combined with
some of the behaviors

32:23.898 --> 32:25.421
that we observed today--

32:25.465 --> 32:28.207
forgetting that you had already
put sugar in your coffee,

32:28.250 --> 32:29.904
problems with simple math--

32:29.948 --> 32:32.124
the findings are consistent
with the--

32:32.167 --> 32:35.605
with the initial stages
of early-onset Alzheimer's.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.566
- Jesus.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.440
Wait.

32:44.484 --> 32:48.009
You mean I'm gonna end up
like my mom?

32:48.053 --> 32:49.489
- There are
certain medications

32:49.532 --> 32:52.405
that help slow
the disease's progression.

32:52.448 --> 32:55.451
- Not to mention hundreds
of new clinical trials,

32:55.495 --> 32:57.540
some of the results
of which are promising,

32:57.584 --> 33:00.587
especially when started early.

33:00.630 --> 33:05.244
- What--wait, so it was me?

33:05.287 --> 33:07.420
I was...

33:07.463 --> 33:10.075
I was overdosing her?

33:10.118 --> 33:11.250
- Accidentally.

33:11.293 --> 33:12.773
You were forgetting

33:12.816 --> 33:14.514
that you had already given her
the medication.

33:14.557 --> 33:17.256
- Oh, my God.

33:17.299 --> 33:19.258
What--what have I done?

33:21.825 --> 33:22.783
I'm so sorry.

33:22.826 --> 33:26.961
I-I can't believe
I suspected you.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.878
Can you--can you
ever forgive me?

33:30.921 --> 33:32.793
- Honey.

33:32.836 --> 33:35.361
It's okay.

33:35.404 --> 33:38.103
- We'll give you both
some time.

33:38.146 --> 33:39.234
- Thank you.

33:46.502 --> 33:48.113
- Hey. I have great news.

33:48.156 --> 33:49.810
We found a donor for Leslie.

33:49.853 --> 33:51.986
Someone answered the hospital's
public plea.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.467
- Really? That fast?

33:54.510 --> 33:56.251
It just went out
a few hours ago.

33:56.295 --> 33:58.079
- I could hardly
believe it myself.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.560
- Um, is it a living donor,
or did the family

34:00.603 --> 34:02.475
of the deceased request
it go to Leslie?

34:02.518 --> 34:05.521
- Uh... I don't know.

34:05.565 --> 34:07.871
It's all anonymous, so...

34:07.915 --> 34:09.351
- Right.

34:15.488 --> 34:17.533
- Her disease was staring her
in the face.

34:17.577 --> 34:18.969
But she was never gonna see it.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.189
- Well, that's the kicker,
right?

34:21.233 --> 34:22.538
I mean, a primary symptom

34:22.582 --> 34:25.019
of early Alzheimer's
is anosognosia.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.760
- Anosognosia?

34:26.803 --> 34:28.675
- It's when you don't realize
you have the disease.

34:28.718 --> 34:31.939
You can't recognize
anything's wrong.

34:38.206 --> 34:39.686
- Dr. Charles?

34:39.729 --> 34:41.862
Can I talk to you
about something?

34:43.516 --> 34:45.300
- Of course.

34:48.999 --> 34:50.088
- Dr. Halstead.

34:50.131 --> 34:52.525
What part
of "you are off the case"

34:52.568 --> 34:55.180
was unclear to you?

34:55.223 --> 34:56.746
- I felt I had
an ethical obligation

34:56.790 --> 34:58.618
to present Celine
with all the options.

34:58.661 --> 35:01.577
- While you had no qualms
about leaving the Addisons

35:01.621 --> 35:03.797
out of the decision entirely.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.060
You know, this is the kind
of behavior

35:06.104 --> 35:08.584
that almost got you kicked out
of residency.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.978
You're an attending
physician now.

35:11.021 --> 35:12.197
You know better.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.546
- Dr. Halstead.

35:13.589 --> 35:15.548
Are you still planning
to observe?

35:15.591 --> 35:18.072
We're about to start.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.379
- We're not done.

35:20.422 --> 35:22.207
I'll deal with you after.

35:30.258 --> 35:32.086
- Dr. Choi.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.044
I'm doing the nursing schedule
for next month.

35:34.088 --> 35:35.742
Wanted to let you know
that I'm putting you

35:35.785 --> 35:37.744
and Nurse April
on alternate shifts.

35:37.787 --> 35:39.006
- Did April request that?

35:39.049 --> 35:40.790
- No.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.749
But until you two
get your act together,

35:42.792 --> 35:45.752
I'm not gonna risk
another spectacle.

35:45.795 --> 35:47.275
- That won't work for me, Mags.

35:47.319 --> 35:50.409
- Unfortunately, Dr. Choi,
it's not your decision to make.

35:50.452 --> 35:53.368
- I understand.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.370
Unless April objects,

35:55.414 --> 35:57.459
I want her on my shifts.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.682
Excuse me.

36:08.992 --> 36:09.993
April.

36:10.037 --> 36:12.387
- I'm leaving.
- Please don't.

36:12.431 --> 36:13.693
- You know what,
for the record,

36:13.736 --> 36:15.782
I would never let
our personal history

36:15.825 --> 36:17.784
affect my decision-making
when it comes to patients.

36:17.827 --> 36:19.960
- I know.
I shouldn't have accused you.

36:20.003 --> 36:21.875
- I didn't report you to Lanik
out of spite.

36:21.918 --> 36:25.661
You left me no choice.
- I'm sorry.

36:25.705 --> 36:28.577
- And maybe I could be
nicer to Vicki.

36:30.492 --> 36:33.234
But it's hard.

36:33.278 --> 36:36.194
Seeing you together is...

36:36.237 --> 36:38.239
It's hard, Ethan.

36:50.077 --> 36:52.253
- April.

36:52.297 --> 36:53.776
- Don't. No.

36:57.345 --> 36:58.825
- Hey.

37:00.653 --> 37:02.045
You okay?

37:03.656 --> 37:05.048
- What?

37:07.877 --> 37:11.794
- Maggie told me about Reggie.

37:13.535 --> 37:16.059
Sounds like you did
everything you could.

37:17.539 --> 37:19.976
- I wish I could have
done more.

37:22.631 --> 37:25.199
- Come on.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.680
Let's go.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.828
- What the hell
were you thinking?

37:45.872 --> 37:47.917
- If Leslie ever finds out--
- She won't.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.310
That's why it's so perfect.

37:49.354 --> 37:51.443
An anonymous,
self-directed donation.

37:51.486 --> 37:54.489
Denise's identity can never be
revealed without her consent.

37:54.533 --> 37:56.056
- There is no justification

37:56.099 --> 37:57.884
for blatantly disregarding
Leslie's wishes.

37:57.927 --> 37:59.364
- Listen, I tried to keep you
out of it.

37:59.407 --> 38:00.887
- You kept me out of it

38:00.930 --> 38:02.584
because you knew
I wouldn't be on board.

38:02.628 --> 38:05.283
- Okay, so go on.
Tell her the truth.

38:05.326 --> 38:06.675
I can take the hit,

38:06.719 --> 38:09.287
but her death,
that'll be on you.

38:09.330 --> 38:13.378
We're saving her life.
The end justifies the means.

38:24.780 --> 38:27.087
- Oh, hey, Daniel.

38:27.130 --> 38:30.525
You got a minute?
- For you? Maybe.

38:30.569 --> 38:32.397
What's up?

38:32.440 --> 38:34.921
- It's about Will Halstead.

38:34.964 --> 38:37.663
- Popular topic
of conversation today.

38:37.706 --> 38:39.317
- Is that right?

38:44.670 --> 38:46.759
- Did--did our babies make it?

38:46.802 --> 38:49.414
- Dr. Dennis will be out
to speak with you both shortly,

38:49.457 --> 38:52.286
but the surgery was a success.

38:52.330 --> 38:56.159
Yeah, both fetuses
have strong heartbeats.

38:56.203 --> 38:59.380
- Is Celine okay?
- Yeah, she did just fine.

39:09.172 --> 39:10.522
- What, so I don't do
what you want,

39:10.565 --> 39:11.784
and you force it on me?

39:11.827 --> 39:13.307
- What are you talking about?

39:13.351 --> 39:15.396
- Mandatory counseling,
Goodwin's orders.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.877
Or I could take
a leave of absence, my choice.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.400
Tell me this isn't your doing.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.663
- I spoke with Dr. Charles
because I'm worried.

39:21.707 --> 39:23.056
- That's terrific.

39:23.099 --> 39:26.320
You told the Head of Psychiatry
I'm unstable.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.713
- You are the only one

39:27.756 --> 39:29.976
who doesn't see
that there's a problem.

39:30.019 --> 39:33.980
Will, please.
This is not you.

39:34.023 --> 39:35.460
- Or maybe it's not
the Will you want.

39:35.503 --> 39:37.113
- What does that mean?

39:37.157 --> 39:40.726
- I am done
being everyone's puppet.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.597
- How can you put that on me?

39:42.641 --> 39:44.164
I wasn't the one
pulling the strings.

39:44.207 --> 39:45.731
How could I?

39:45.774 --> 39:47.994
You lied to me,
you kept me in the dark.

39:48.037 --> 39:50.475
You're still keeping me
in the dark.

40:06.839 --> 40:08.406
- Well, well.

40:10.233 --> 40:11.844
Young Oedipus.

40:17.850 --> 40:20.113
Come to hit me again?

40:23.116 --> 40:26.293
- What happened
between you and Ava?

40:35.998 --> 40:38.218
Let me get you a drink first.
