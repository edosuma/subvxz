04:15.164 --> 04:16.831
What do you think?

05:08.217 --> 05:10.285
<i>"He wanted to cry.</i>

05:10.319 --> 05:12.755
<i>He wanted to give
himself up to despair.</i>

05:13.888 --> 05:15.557
And when he came
to, he found himself

05:15.591 --> 05:17.526
stretched out on
the bed and a fairy

05:17.559 --> 05:18.960
was sitting next to him.

05:20.295 --> 05:21.929
'Tomorrow, your wish
will come true,'

05:21.963 --> 05:22.997
the fairy said.

05:23.965 --> 05:25.267
'What is it' Pinocchio replied.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.369
'Tomorrow you'll
cease to be a puppet

05:27.403 --> 05:29.571
and you're going to
become a real boy.'

05:30.606 --> 05:33.242
Pinocchio was beside
himself with joy.

05:35.244 --> 05:36.512
But it wasn't meant to be.

05:37.346 --> 05:39.314
Next day, he fell
down on all fours

05:39.348 --> 05:41.884
and began running and
jumping around the room.

05:41.916 --> 05:45.254
His arms turned into legs,
his face became a snout,

05:45.287 --> 05:49.091
his back covered
with long gray hairs.

05:49.124 --> 05:50.958
And the most horrible
moment was the one

05:50.992 --> 05:53.495
in which he felt
his tail appear.

05:54.763 --> 05:58.434
<i>And overcome with shame
and grief, he began to cry.</i>

05:59.468 --> 06:01.870
<i>But what's done
can't be undone."</i>

08:58.981 --> 08:59.982
Dylan?

09:07.356 --> 09:08.190
Dylan?

09:09.524 --> 09:11.660
You okay? I thought I
heard something fall.

09:15.163 --> 09:15.998
Okay.

09:17.165 --> 09:18.000
Food's ready.

09:19.835 --> 09:20.669
Yeah.

09:33.382 --> 09:35.651
You listen to me. Hmm?

09:37.486 --> 09:40.222
We start thinking about
the things we're missing,

09:40.255 --> 09:42.524
we forget about
the things we have.

09:42.557 --> 09:45.128
You're perfect just
the way you are.

09:46.361 --> 09:47.496
Never forget that.

09:48.864 --> 09:49.698
Okay?

09:54.736 --> 09:56.238
All right. Let's eat.

10:33.275 --> 10:35.111
You know, I'm hoping
your grandparents

10:35.144 --> 10:37.080
will be able to come
down for the holidays.

10:38.780 --> 10:39.748
Won't that be nice?

10:45.454 --> 10:47.489
It's pretty good.
Have you tried it?

10:50.992 --> 10:54.296
Dylan, what's wrong?

11:06.274 --> 11:09.778
Yes.

11:12.148 --> 11:14.583
But he was very old. Right?

11:14.616 --> 11:16.485
Don't have to worry about it.

11:18.487 --> 11:19.488
Not for a long time.

11:30.365 --> 11:32.168
Whoo, how'd that happen? Huh?

11:33.702 --> 11:35.337
Oh no, the tiger awaits.

11:35.370 --> 11:37.240
He awakes. Oh, got it.

11:37.272 --> 11:40.209
Oh.

11:41.543 --> 11:42.978
All right, come on,
come on, eat, eat, eat.

11:43.011 --> 11:44.346
You gotta eat
something. All right?

11:47.682 --> 11:50.018
Okay, you sure you're
gonna be okay without me?

11:50.051 --> 11:52.854
I can always pick up a
double another night.

11:52.888 --> 11:54.589
Um, oh!

11:54.623 --> 11:57.359
The number for the pager's
on the fridge. Okay?

11:57.392 --> 11:58.693
If you need me, just call.

12:00.163 --> 12:01.863
Oh, keys, key, keys, uh!

12:03.232 --> 12:04.432
Don't forget to take
a shower before bed.

12:04.466 --> 12:06.001
I'll be home before you get up.

12:07.302 --> 12:10.939
And, hey, tune in around 9:30.

12:10.972 --> 12:12.374
I've got a surprise for you.

12:13.975 --> 12:14.776
Love you.

12:36.232 --> 12:38.733
"At the start of
the final hour of the day,

12:38.767 --> 12:40.802
set a candle aflame.

12:40.836 --> 12:45.006
Place three drops of fresh
blood into the melting wax.

12:45.040 --> 12:48.144
Face your reflection,
speak these words,

12:48.177 --> 12:49.411
and make your wish known.

12:51.180 --> 12:55.550
'Spirit of fire, let the
wheel of fortune turn.

12:55.584 --> 12:57.452
Grant me my desire.'

12:58.553 --> 13:00.256
Should your strength
of will survive

13:00.289 --> 13:02.191
until the stroke of midnight,

13:02.225 --> 13:03.725
extinguish the
flame and the Djinn

13:03.758 --> 13:06.061
will grant your heart's desire.

13:06.095 --> 13:08.130
But beware the Djinn's toll.

13:09.265 --> 13:11.833
For the gift that you seek,

13:11.867 --> 13:13.768
may cost your soul.

13:15.403 --> 13:18.406
Artifacts required, one
clock, one candle, one mirror."

46:42.077 --> 46:44.213
Part man and part
beast in nature,

46:44.247 --> 46:46.548
the Djinn is one of the
five immortal guardians

of the Shadow Realm.

46:48.383 --> 46:51.519
Appearing to those who
conjure the Wish of Desire,

46:51.553 --> 46:53.388
the Djinn will grant one wish

46:53.421 --> 46:55.224

enough to survive

46:55.258 --> 46:57.592
an hour in its presence.

But it will consume the
heart of all those who fail,

47:01.062 --> 47:05.268
damning their soul to the
Shadow Realm for all eternity.

47:05.301 --> 47:07.236
Assuming the form of the dead,

47:07.270 --> 47:09.604
the Djinn will often
grant wishes in such a way

47:09.638 --> 47:12.108
as to thwart the
desires of the summoner.

47:12.141 --> 47:14.143
Their fulfillment
frequently leading

47:14.176 --> 47:16.945
to unintended consequences.

47:16.978 --> 47:18.980
Although immortal, the
Djinn is susceptible

47:19.014 --> 47:21.716
to the laws of men when
in the human realm,

47:21.750 --> 47:25.787
able to regenerate only
upon return to its world.

47:25.820 --> 47:29.292
