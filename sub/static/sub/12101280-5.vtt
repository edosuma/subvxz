WEBVTT

00:11.219 --> 00:13.221
[dramatic music playing]

00:24.441 --> 00:26.901
[bell tolling]

00:48.798 --> 00:50.842
[imperceptible]

01:09.235 --> 01:10.695
[imperceptible]

01:29.923 --> 01:31.633
[indistinct chatter]

01:42.977 --> 01:47.106
That one is our invitation to perform,
signed by the Queen.

01:56.032 --> 01:59.244
This writ allows you access
to the grounds,

01:59.327 --> 02:01.955
the main ballroom and nowhere else.

02:02.038 --> 02:05.875
You are being employed by the Queen.
You are not her guests.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.504
You are to stay together
as a group, at all times.

02:09.587 --> 02:13.967
No guns, no knives,
no weapons of any kind.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.470
Punishment for violation of these rules

02:17.554 --> 02:19.931
ranges from being fired
to being fired upon.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.267
Now, do we all understand these rules?

02:22.350 --> 02:24.602
[man grunting] No!

02:26.646 --> 02:28.189
[continues grunting]

02:28.273 --> 02:29.732
Oh, for Saints' sake.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.152
[man] The Sun Summoner!
I just want to see her!

02:32.861 --> 02:34.195
[groans]

02:34.988 --> 02:36.156
All right, that's enough.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.785
Do we really need
the entire corps for one man?

02:40.869 --> 02:41.703
Come on.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.539
The rest of you, post up now.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.041
[crowd cheering and whistling]

02:49.544 --> 02:51.212
[all laughing]

02:51.296 --> 02:53.965
I panicked. Nobody's ever asked
to spend time with me before.

02:54.048 --> 02:57.093
-So you set him on fire?
-It was an accident.

02:57.176 --> 02:59.721
The Squallers had to launch him
right into the lake.

03:00.221 --> 03:03.725
So, set ablaze, then nearly drowned.

03:03.808 --> 03:06.019
You've made quite a first impression.

03:06.102 --> 03:07.729
-[groans]
-[both laughing]

03:10.064 --> 03:11.357
-Hi, Genya.
-Hi, Genya.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.611
-They need you for the kefta.
-No, I'm so late. Nadia, come on.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.910
-Thank all Saints I got here in time.
-[Alina laughs]

03:21.993 --> 03:25.538
-I think they tried their best, actually.
-That's a terrifying thought.

03:29.751 --> 03:30.919
Still nothing from Mal.

03:33.671 --> 03:37.717
You don't have to update me anymore.
I'm sure you've got enough on your plate.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.222
You have no idea.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.266
The Queen, Her Royal Bossiness, Tatiana,

03:45.350 --> 03:47.227
has absolutely no regard
for my need to sleep.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.646
She woke before dawn
and demanded I touch up her face

03:49.729 --> 03:51.397
before the rest of her team arrived.

03:56.819 --> 03:57.737
Hmm.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.326
I can accidentally blind her
in the demonstration, if you like.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.285
[chuckles]

04:06.204 --> 04:07.997
[Alina] What's that for?

04:08.581 --> 04:10.583
Relax your eyebrows.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.296
I don't mind, actually.

04:16.047 --> 04:19.050
It tends to shift
the King's gaze in her direction.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.511
At least until nightfall.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.473
Hmm.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.023
Let's just say the Fold is gone.
What then?

04:34.649 --> 04:38.403
Ravka will be revived.
The Second Army won't be as necessary.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.405
Grisha will have new opportunities.

04:40.488 --> 04:41.739
[Genya chuckles]

04:41.823 --> 04:45.868
I've always wanted to travel the world.
See the True Sea.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.579
Visit the library
at the University of Ketterdam.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.957
Mal always talked
about retiring to a farm.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.918
I never really liked farms.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.255
But perhaps a dacha in Balakirev.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.465
Assuming Saints get to retire.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.135
-Right. Yeah, there's that.
-[chuckles]

05:03.928 --> 05:04.762
[Alina] Oh.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.601
I know the general insisted
on black for the performance,

05:10.685 --> 05:13.104
but perhaps after,
you could return to blue.

05:13.688 --> 05:17.191
I think I'm going to stick
with the black, moving forward.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.325
I like seeing you this way…

05:26.659 --> 05:31.122
but… I want you to be careful.

05:31.998 --> 05:32.832
Of what?

05:33.916 --> 05:35.126
Powerful men.

05:36.878 --> 05:37.712
[knock on door]

05:38.755 --> 05:39.756
Come in.

05:43.092 --> 05:43.968
Hi.

05:44.052 --> 05:47.930
Uh, this is David Kostyk.
Expert resident Fabrikator.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.100
He created the blue light
we use for crossing the Fold.

05:51.184 --> 05:56.272
Yeah, the general had me make these
for your demonstration this evening.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.776
They're lovely.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.696
What do they do?

06:03.780 --> 06:07.283
They'll make it easier
to split one beam into two.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.412
Your show of power
will determine who remains our ally.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.423
They'll help enhance your performance.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.592
Ingenious.

06:40.399 --> 06:42.443
I think I'll be all right on my own.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.528
[David clears throat]

06:45.363 --> 06:46.280
Of course.

06:49.992 --> 06:50.952
See you at the fete!

07:04.382 --> 07:05.216
What?

07:06.134 --> 07:08.761
You never compliment anyone to their face.

07:09.470 --> 07:10.680
You like him.

07:10.763 --> 07:11.681
Not a word.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.432
[Alina chuckles]

07:13.516 --> 07:15.351
"Ingenious."

07:15.852 --> 07:16.811
[gasps]

07:21.399 --> 07:22.942
[Kaz] Here's the plan.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.570
I'll walk the route
our target will take from the ballroom

07:25.653 --> 07:27.780
to the dinner event
and look for an ambush point.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.365
[breathing heavily]

07:30.700 --> 07:32.535
[Inej] You should have one of us with you.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.413
[Kaz] I'll manage.

07:36.414 --> 07:40.209
You can't blow your cover this early,
and Jesper needs to plot our escape route.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.547
There is a gap
in the schedule between events,

07:44.630 --> 07:46.382
so they may place her in a room here,

07:46.466 --> 07:49.802
away from the crowd, somewhere safe.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.185
This would be where they feel
she's most protected

07:57.268 --> 07:59.520
and therefore, the best place to grab her.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.735
We just need to find a way in.

08:05.818 --> 08:09.238
And have someone ready with a distraction
to give us cover on our way out.

08:20.541 --> 08:21.375
[grunts softly]

08:22.502 --> 08:24.128
[footsteps approaching]

08:25.129 --> 08:26.088
[grunts]

08:44.565 --> 08:45.775
[mechanical creaking]

08:48.152 --> 08:49.904
[Kaz] That's where we grab her.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.748
[Inej] Does this look right?

09:01.499 --> 09:03.876
I haven't done this routine
since I was 14.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.171
[Inej groans]

09:08.339 --> 09:09.715
[indistinct chatter]

09:12.760 --> 09:16.264
[sighs] Jesper, you're not even
paying attention, are you?

09:17.848 --> 09:20.268
-Sorry. What now?
-I said, you're not paying attention.

09:20.935 --> 09:24.897
Oh. I do vaguely remember you
being airborne. Was that recently?

09:24.981 --> 09:26.983
Aren't you supposed
to be scouting our way out?

09:27.066 --> 09:28.234
What do you think I'm doing?

09:28.317 --> 09:30.361
I think you're flirting
with that stable hand.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.571
What stable… Oh, him.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.991
I suppose he's moderately attractive,
but I hadn't really noticed.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.577
This is going to be a lot less amusing

09:37.660 --> 09:40.121
when the carriage you find
isn't fast enough.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.915
Oh. So now you're an acrobat
and a carriage expert?

09:42.999 --> 09:45.167
Tell me, what makes
one carriage faster than another?

09:45.251 --> 09:47.003
Wheels? Weight? The year it was built?

09:47.086 --> 09:48.421
Don't answer, trick question.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.423
The right answer
is there is no right answer.

09:50.506 --> 09:51.632
The carriage doesn't matter.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.467
It's the horse that makes the difference.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.469
The horse determines how far, how fast.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.097
And that determines
whether you get caught or not.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.350
No human being should ever be
as proud as you are right now.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.978
Me? What about your Sun Summoner?

10:05.688 --> 10:09.233
I'm not the one who invited half the world
to see me do a party trick.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.697
You think that's what it is? Just a trick?

10:14.780 --> 10:17.742
Kaz thinks it's a trick.
He's not usually wrong.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.661
I know what Kaz thinks.
I'm asking what you think.

10:23.706 --> 10:24.582
Hey…

10:26.500 --> 10:30.379
I think… that as long as we get paid…

10:32.506 --> 10:34.133
I don't care if she's real or not.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.144
Wait till you see this kefta.
It's a masterpiece.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.605
I can't wait to see Zoya's face
when she sees you.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.649
[indistinct chatter]

10:49.732 --> 10:51.692
We have to go outside.

10:51.776 --> 10:52.860
No.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.071
Oh, come on, it's like Butter Week!

10:55.738 --> 10:57.573
In Keramzin,
noblemen would drive around carts

10:57.657 --> 11:00.451
with all kinds of cheeses and breads.

11:00.534 --> 11:03.913
Then they'd open their estates,
put on carnivals with traveling troupes.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.832
Orphans weren't allowed,
but Mal and I used to sneak out.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.502
It's not safe.
Somebody might recognize you.

11:10.878 --> 11:15.132
I can wear a scarf. Or a hat. Or two hats.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.969
Only the people in the palaces
know who I am.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.430
Can't I have this one thing
before everything changes?

11:25.559 --> 11:26.936
[Genya] And what about them?

11:33.526 --> 11:34.985
[Alina giggling]

11:38.072 --> 11:40.074
Where did you learn to be so commanding?

11:40.157 --> 11:41.909
I was imitating Baghra.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.536
[laughs] Oh!

11:46.497 --> 11:48.582
Okay, that's enough. Let's go back.

11:48.666 --> 11:55.214
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present Alina Starkov!

11:55.923 --> 11:58.217
[dramatic music playing]

12:07.935 --> 12:09.186
Well, this is awkward.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.815
-Should I tell them?
-Alina, no!

12:12.898 --> 12:15.067
Not everyone knows what you look like.
If we get caught here…

12:16.777 --> 12:19.864
[Marko] No! Come here!

12:19.947 --> 12:23.075
Genya! What were you two thinking?

12:23.159 --> 12:24.952
It… it was my fault. I insisted.

12:25.619 --> 12:26.579
[laughs]

12:26.662 --> 12:30.082
I'm sorry, I was just trying
my Ivan impression. How did I do?

12:30.166 --> 12:32.084
-A little too convincing.
-Good.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.502
Intimidation is a useful tool.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.964
Now, let's hurry out of here
because my better half might come looking.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.048
[Alina laughs]

12:50.769 --> 12:51.896
Well, that's news.

12:55.024 --> 12:58.569
Deliver this directly to General Kirigan.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.239
-If anyone…
-[Mal breathing heavily]

13:02.323 --> 13:04.200
You should be resting, soldier.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.784
This is about the Stag, isn't it?

13:06.535 --> 13:08.245
You're riding for Os Alta?

13:08.329 --> 13:11.290
You're in no condition to go. Sir.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.584
[Mal] I'm the one who found the Stag.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.794
I should be the one
to deliver the news to her.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.632
To him. To General Kirigan.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.813
You'll ride together.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.534
[Kaz] You're sure it was her?

13:47.034 --> 13:50.037
I'm telling you, she's part Shu.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.915
When exactly did you see her?

13:52.998 --> 13:54.166
Just after midday.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.834
What's in this room?

13:57.169 --> 13:59.672
[Kaz] Fitting room.
It's where she'll go to change for dinner.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.757
And that's where we'll grab her.

14:01.840 --> 14:06.095
Out of the way, clean lines of sight,
easily controlled space. I like it.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.555
I'd like it, too, if it had a door.

14:07.638 --> 14:10.224
-It doesn't have a door?
-Not one that we can use.

14:11.100 --> 14:15.145
It's some sort of Grisha lock.
It took a Materialnik to open it.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.523
Is there no way to pick the lock?

14:17.606 --> 14:21.277
Actually, there is.
I can get through the door.

14:21.986 --> 14:22.820
How?

14:22.903 --> 14:25.573
The locking mechanisms
are Fabrikator-designed.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.659
Iron cogs that slide into place
without a latch.

14:29.410 --> 14:33.205
But for one of us to open it,
we'll need a lodestone.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.917
With a minimum
2,000 gauss external strength.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.127
Hard to find.

14:38.794 --> 14:42.214
It's not like we're just walking around
with one of those in our pockets.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.009
[Arken sighs]

14:48.178 --> 14:51.932
You don't want to keep it
in your pocket for too long. [chuckles]

14:52.892 --> 14:55.185
Not if you're intending
on having children someday.

14:57.104 --> 15:00.190
All right. Arken grabs the target.

15:01.025 --> 15:04.028
You want the new guy
to grab the million-kruge package?

15:04.111 --> 15:06.655
The new guy knows
his way around Grisha locks.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.366
Our futures depend on this.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.702
The rest of us
will be setting up a lynx flush.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.079
We are?

15:15.456 --> 15:16.665
[Arken] What's a lynx flush?

15:17.958 --> 15:20.920
Lynx are pack hunters. Very smart.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.463
They'll clear a path for the prey.

15:22.546 --> 15:23.380
Oh.

15:24.048 --> 15:27.551
So, I grab the Summoner,
and you clear the path?

15:27.635 --> 15:29.511
That's right. We do it before dinner.

15:30.554 --> 15:35.100
You grab. Inej and I clear, and Jesper,
make sure there's a fast way out.

15:50.699 --> 15:53.243
Ivan! My kefta!

16:04.546 --> 16:05.381
You're not Ivan.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.842
Sorry to disappoint.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.930
Do I sense a little disdain
for my Heartrender?

16:13.931 --> 16:16.558
You know, once you get to know him,
he's actually quite funny.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.686
I bet you find volcra hilarious.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.273
May I?

16:25.484 --> 16:26.318
Thank you.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.574
I hear you were able to focus
and split light without the gloves.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.452
I appreciate the gesture, though.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.123
Well, they were only a safeguard, really.

16:39.206 --> 16:40.457
In case of nerves.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.461
I imagine there are
few gatherings in Keramzin

16:44.545 --> 16:48.048
that involve such… spectacle.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.260
None, in fact.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.806
But I'm actually not that nervous.

16:55.889 --> 16:58.058
I may have considered
throwing myself down the stairs

16:58.142 --> 16:59.727
to get out of it once or twice.

17:00.686 --> 17:04.148
Wouldn't work. I have Healers.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.150
[Alina laughs]

17:12.156 --> 17:14.616
I was nervous at first.

17:16.410 --> 17:20.539
But talking to Genya, I've realized
what this demonstration represents.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.334
I've always felt like an outsider.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.004
Especially when I first got here.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.341
But now I finally feel like I belong.

17:32.760 --> 17:37.139
And not that I just belong here,
but to something greater.

17:38.307 --> 17:43.520
That we can offer Grisha and Ravkans
hope for the future.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.068
That means a lot to me, Alina.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.948
You mean a lot…

17:57.868 --> 17:59.536
to everyone.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.484
Not many people surprise me, Miss Starkov.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.030
[door opens]

18:35.906 --> 18:37.074
[Kirigan clears throat]

18:41.370 --> 18:42.579
[attendant] Excuse me, General.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.457
[neighing]

18:54.758 --> 18:55.884
Can I help you?

18:56.635 --> 18:58.137
Ah! You are here. I…

18:59.763 --> 19:01.515
The ambassador has requested his horses.

19:01.598 --> 19:02.599
What? Now?

19:03.225 --> 19:05.644
-Apparently so.
-You're not going to stay for the Queen?

19:05.727 --> 19:07.229
[chuckles] Have you met the Queen?

19:07.312 --> 19:09.064
I mean,
actually had a conversation with her?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.233
Can't say that I have, no.

19:11.316 --> 19:15.195
Well, if you had, you'd understand
why the ambassador wants his horses.

19:15.279 --> 19:18.073
-Which one, sir?
-Uh, the pair of Percherons.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.034
I mean which ambassador, sir.

19:21.118 --> 19:24.163
Oh. [laughs]
Uh, of course, um, Novyi Zem.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.874
-Novyi Zem? Do you like it there?
-Hmm.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.917
Sometimes.

19:29.960 --> 19:30.794
Just sometimes?

19:31.503 --> 19:33.255
It has its pros and cons.

19:34.214 --> 19:37.009
But, uh, the more I travel…
the more I learn

19:37.092 --> 19:40.304
that where you are doesn't matter
nearly as much as who you're with.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.557
[laughs] I like that.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.269
And what other wisdom
have you learned on the road?

19:48.562 --> 19:50.147
That when there's something you want…

19:51.440 --> 19:54.651
better to act without thinking
than think without acting.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.865
Weren't you part
of that players' troupe earlier?

19:59.948 --> 20:04.161
Oh, no, no, no…
Not me, no. I'm a terrible actor. [laughs]

20:04.244 --> 20:09.124
But, uh… I'm not against
the occasional light role-play.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.349
[indistinct chatter]

20:26.808 --> 20:29.269
I didn't know the Zemeni had such talent.

20:29.811 --> 20:30.771
She's Suli.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.150
[indistinct chatter]

20:47.412 --> 20:48.914
[speaking indistinctly]

20:59.132 --> 21:03.720
I notice a certain West Ravkan general
is conspicuously absent.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.264
Was he invited, do you think?

21:05.347 --> 21:06.181
Zlatan?

21:07.015 --> 21:10.435
[chuckles] I doubt he'd risk
being this far behind enemy lines.

21:11.228 --> 21:14.523
So it's true? West Ravka means to secede?

21:14.606 --> 21:16.149
He has the support.

21:16.817 --> 21:20.028
There were Fjerdan delegates
at his last rally.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.364
Explains his turning a blind eye

21:22.447 --> 21:26.076
to the Drüskelle
raiding his port cities for Grisha.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.371
Well, if tonight's light show
is a success,

21:29.454 --> 21:32.040
we may need to re-examine
our commitments with him.

21:45.554 --> 21:49.057
[laughs nervously] The Kaelish ambassador
is clumsy when he's drunk.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.185
You can't wear that in here.
Get a replacement from laundry.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.146
-My orders are to--
-You heard.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.648
Yes. Sorry.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.448
-Is it my size?
-You have to ask?

22:04.531 --> 22:06.783
Do you remember
what happened last time we did this?

22:06.867 --> 22:09.202
-Got me a man's uniform.
-It worked, didn't it?

22:09.286 --> 22:11.955
Just be happy
I'm eager to get out of this.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.505
See you at the meeting point.

22:29.806 --> 22:31.183
[indistinct chatter]

22:32.851 --> 22:33.685
[King Pyotr] General.

22:34.561 --> 22:37.022
Tsar. Moya tsaritsa.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.859
I do hope
you're both enjoying the festivities.

22:40.942 --> 22:43.945
I must confess, I'm not bored.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.197
I quite like it.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.657
There's always been a certain…

22:48.492 --> 22:51.453
quaintness about the Little Palace.
[chuckles]

22:54.623 --> 22:56.124
It's not time yet. This way.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.835
[indistinct chatter]

23:06.384 --> 23:07.886
[chatter stops]

23:28.615 --> 23:31.618
You were supposed to enter
accompanied by palace guards.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.956
You look lovely, by the way.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.253
You looked like you needed saving.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.963
[fire lighting]

23:43.046 --> 23:44.172
[guests gasping]

23:50.178 --> 23:51.972
[guests exclaiming]

24:07.195 --> 24:10.031
[clapping and cheering]

24:11.575 --> 24:14.744
Come. Let's give them all a good look.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.040
[woman] Well done.

24:23.753 --> 24:25.213
[indistinct chatter]

24:28.175 --> 24:29.342
[Kaz] It's reflective glass.

24:29.926 --> 24:31.094
Bounce the light into that,

24:31.178 --> 24:33.346
and people won't know
whether it's coming or going.

24:43.607 --> 24:44.649
Are you ready?

24:45.650 --> 24:46.484
I think I am.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.446
You know who you are.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.114
I do.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.662
[applause stops]

25:04.002 --> 25:05.629
And now it's time to show the world.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.382
[guests murmuring]

25:12.928 --> 25:14.095
[murmuring stops]

25:16.306 --> 25:18.475
Her name is Alina Starkov.

25:20.101 --> 25:24.105
And she will bring liberation to us all.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.168
[in Ravkan] Sankta Alina.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.003
[guests murmuring]

27:14.299 --> 27:15.717
[guest] Sankta Alina.

27:19.387 --> 27:20.388
Sankta Alina.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.018
[Jesper in English] Saints!

27:25.101 --> 27:26.311
[pants]

27:26.936 --> 27:28.188
[sighs]

27:28.271 --> 27:29.439
[both laugh]

27:30.106 --> 27:32.984
-[breathlessly] That was…
-Yeah.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.152
I mean…

27:34.235 --> 27:35.362
I know.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.072
[both laugh]

27:37.155 --> 27:37.989
[guard] Dima!

27:39.616 --> 27:41.201
-Dima!
-I've got to go.

27:41.785 --> 27:42.869
I understand.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.038
But it was…

27:45.121 --> 27:46.247
I agree.

28:00.845 --> 28:04.516
[guard] I don't know, but for now,
no one leaves. It's the general's orders.

28:04.599 --> 28:05.642
[horse snorting]

28:15.276 --> 28:18.154
[whispers] Twenty-four, twenty-six.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.783
[mechanical creaking]

28:23.952 --> 28:24.994
[creaking stops]

28:39.843 --> 28:41.386
[indistinct chatter]

28:57.318 --> 28:59.112
Doors are closed for the night, gentlemen.

28:59.195 --> 29:00.822
We're here to see General Kirigan.

29:08.621 --> 29:10.039
Is this supposed to be a joke?

29:11.458 --> 29:13.084
Morozova's Stag is a myth.

29:14.294 --> 29:17.380
A living Saint is in your palace right now
and you scoff at a myth?

29:18.381 --> 29:21.217
Do you want to tell your general
that you turned us away?

29:21.301 --> 29:25.638
Fine. Your funeral.
Leave your weapons here.

29:47.994 --> 29:51.873
You have earned the pride you now wear.

29:53.708 --> 29:54.542
Thank you.

29:54.626 --> 29:58.838
I must say, Sol Koroleva,
you are becoming quite dangerous.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.632
I'm sorry?

30:01.174 --> 30:03.802
You will become even more dangerous still.

30:05.136 --> 30:09.474
You have no idea how much larger
a role you have to play, do you?

30:11.142 --> 30:16.564
The people are erecting altars
to Sankta Alina.

30:18.107 --> 30:19.359
Why would they do that?

30:20.109 --> 30:23.905
Because there is something
far greater than armies,

30:23.988 --> 30:27.742
something strong enough
to topple kings and generals,

30:27.826 --> 30:31.704
to crumble nations and birth empires.

30:32.539 --> 30:34.249
Faith, Alina.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.000
[Genya] There you are.

30:36.084 --> 30:39.254
Excuse us, but General Kirigan
needs Alina ready for the dinner.

30:40.547 --> 30:44.467
Faith, Alina Starkov. Remember that.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.819
Tofin, put it down.

31:05.613 --> 31:07.782
These are the two
who claim they found the Stag?

31:08.324 --> 31:10.243
No, sir. He did.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.121
And you are?

31:15.164 --> 31:16.875
Malyen Oretsev.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.086
Tracker with the 36th, sir.

31:22.088 --> 31:22.922
Mal.

31:24.757 --> 31:25.842
What a surprise.

31:28.219 --> 31:29.137
Leave us.

31:32.181 --> 31:33.600
[door opens]

31:37.395 --> 31:38.521
[door closes]

31:42.275 --> 31:43.109
Are you all right?

31:45.028 --> 31:45.862
Yes, sir.

31:49.282 --> 31:53.328
So… there are a lot of deer in the wild.

31:55.288 --> 31:57.373
How do you know you found the right stag?

32:04.464 --> 32:05.298
[Mal] It was this one.

32:09.844 --> 32:11.012
-You're certain?
-I am.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.265
Twice as big as any other. All white.

32:14.974 --> 32:16.684
When it looked at me head on,
its antlers…

32:17.644 --> 32:18.603
they…

32:19.437 --> 32:21.397
-[Mal sighs]
-What?

32:22.148 --> 32:23.149
I think I saw that.

32:27.779 --> 32:31.032
Was it alone? With a herd?

32:31.115 --> 32:34.494
It had traveled with a small herd,
but when I encountered it, it was alone.

32:34.577 --> 32:35.578
Grazing.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.039
Show me where.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.249
North of Chernast.

32:40.333 --> 32:43.294
No, precisely. Mark it for me.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.510
Not until I see Alina.

32:53.054 --> 32:56.766
-I beg your pardon?
-I know her. We're friends.

32:56.849 --> 32:58.977
[breathes deeply]

32:59.060 --> 33:00.061
You let me see her…

33:01.437 --> 33:03.147
I'll tell you where the Stag is.

33:06.192 --> 33:08.778
Do you know how many claim
to know the Sun Summoner?

33:08.861 --> 33:11.781
Try to get a meeting with her
just to be in her presence?

33:13.116 --> 33:14.200
Ask her about me.

33:18.037 --> 33:20.498
Tell me something
only few about her would know.

33:20.581 --> 33:23.209
Something… personal.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.294
Like what?

33:25.378 --> 33:28.172
Like… what's her favorite flower?

33:28.256 --> 33:29.507
-Or what kind of book--
-Iris.

33:31.843 --> 33:35.096
Irises. Blue ones, not the white.

33:38.766 --> 33:39.600
All right.

33:41.352 --> 33:42.895
I'll have you shown to a room here.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.981
And, assuming that she proves you right…

33:46.149 --> 33:47.608
I'll bring her to you later.

33:49.610 --> 33:50.778
Fair?

34:08.129 --> 34:10.173
[door opens and closes]

34:11.049 --> 34:12.592
What? What is it?

34:13.426 --> 34:14.594
Someone has found it.

34:16.763 --> 34:17.889
That's impossible.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.016
Who says so?

34:20.099 --> 34:23.061
A tracker from Chernast.
With another soldier.

34:24.145 --> 34:25.229
Bring him to me.

34:29.108 --> 34:31.694
He's already been taken
to see the general.

34:31.778 --> 34:34.322
Apparently, he'd issued
the order to find the Stag.

34:35.656 --> 34:38.117
We cannot let him obtain
that kind of power.

34:43.122 --> 34:44.415
Listen to me…

34:47.210 --> 34:48.044
carefully.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.224
[door closes]

35:14.195 --> 35:16.322
[grunting]

35:17.365 --> 35:19.200
This is from General Zlatan.

35:21.786 --> 35:22.829
What is…

35:26.165 --> 35:27.750
[grunting]

35:31.587 --> 35:32.505
[yelps]

35:33.881 --> 35:35.133
[groans]

35:37.552 --> 35:38.594
[guard] Gunfire!

35:38.678 --> 35:39.971
Come on, down the stairs!

35:40.054 --> 35:41.514
You two, take that way!

35:42.140 --> 35:43.724
He went this way!

35:46.519 --> 35:47.645
[groans]

35:52.441 --> 35:54.819
[gasping] Genya.

35:55.403 --> 35:56.529
It's okay.

35:56.612 --> 35:58.739
[crying]

36:00.283 --> 36:01.742
I'm here, Marie.

36:03.327 --> 36:07.206
Put me back. I don't want
to die with the wrong face on.

36:08.791 --> 36:09.959
[gasping]

36:16.757 --> 36:18.217
[blood squelching]

36:20.094 --> 36:21.637
[laughing]

36:21.721 --> 36:23.014
[speaking indistinctly]

36:25.433 --> 36:27.894
[Inej] And the lynx flush
was to smoke out Arken.

36:29.395 --> 36:31.731
[Kaz] Like I said,
our futures depend on this.

36:34.066 --> 36:36.027
I saw two identical dresses
in the fitting room.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.029
The target is wearing one,

36:38.112 --> 36:41.449
and an Inferni about the same height
and build was measured for the other.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.492
They need the target
for the demonstration,

36:43.576 --> 36:44.619
but at the reception,

36:44.702 --> 36:46.996
that's when they'll deploy
a double for security reasons.

36:47.663 --> 36:48.789
Alina!

36:48.873 --> 36:52.585
So, I set Arken after the double
while we stay on the target.

36:52.668 --> 36:54.086
Arken will get caught.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.964
He chose his fate in Novokribirsk
when he met with Zlatan.

36:57.840 --> 36:58.883
What if you're wrong?

36:59.675 --> 37:01.510
What if we sandbagged him
with a lynx flush,

37:01.594 --> 37:03.387
and the meeting
had nothing to do with this?

37:03.471 --> 37:06.849
The only two men in the world
who profit off the Fold? Doubtful.

37:10.019 --> 37:10.853
Now.

37:17.652 --> 37:18.903
Miss Starkov!

37:20.321 --> 37:22.990
We are to escort you to dinner.
Could you come with us, please?

37:23.074 --> 37:24.242
I thought, um…

37:26.452 --> 37:28.079
Actually, I am quite hungry.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.467
Thank you. I'll take her from here.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.347
For you.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.274
All right. Plan B.

37:58.567 --> 38:01.487
Scratch that. Plan F. Stay on the target
and meet me at the escape route.

38:01.570 --> 38:03.406
He's an Inferni. Don't take chances.

38:11.455 --> 38:12.999
The general must have been overjoyed

38:13.082 --> 38:15.334
when you told him precisely
where to find the Stag.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.252
Not yet.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.212
So he doesn't yet know?

38:20.298 --> 38:21.549
Where are you taking me?

38:22.091 --> 38:23.551
Exactly where you need to go.

38:36.772 --> 38:38.691
[grunting]

38:50.494 --> 38:52.413
Tofin. Shit.

38:53.622 --> 38:54.665
[gasps]

38:55.833 --> 38:57.084
[groans]

39:05.676 --> 39:06.969
[grunting]

39:07.636 --> 39:09.013
[groans]

39:11.682 --> 39:12.850
[straining]

39:26.030 --> 39:27.073
[grunting]

39:32.161 --> 39:33.329
[rod clatters]

39:33.412 --> 39:34.955
[panting]

39:44.840 --> 39:47.635
I don't recall
this being part of the schedule.

39:51.889 --> 39:52.723
It isn't.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.981
Perhaps you'd prefer to attend the dinner.

40:01.649 --> 40:02.942
Marie can manage.

40:03.567 --> 40:06.028
-By herself?
-She has Genya.

40:06.695 --> 40:07.571
Ah.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.241
Well…

40:12.326 --> 40:13.577
Then, um…

40:16.497 --> 40:20.334
I suppose she'll probably be all right.

40:23.796 --> 40:24.797
Don't you think?

40:52.491 --> 40:53.325
Are you sure?

41:04.044 --> 41:05.546
[knocking on door]

41:06.547 --> 41:07.882
[both laugh]

41:10.468 --> 41:11.844
[knocking on door]

41:15.014 --> 41:16.390
[knocking continues]

41:19.560 --> 41:20.769
[Kirigan sighs]

41:23.814 --> 41:24.773
What is it?

41:24.857 --> 41:26.942
Marie and Genya
were attacked in the fitting room.

41:27.026 --> 41:27.985
Alina was the target.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.363
We have a suspect in custody.

41:32.907 --> 41:33.741
Wait here.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.370
Is something wrong?

41:38.454 --> 41:39.455
It's nothing.

41:40.122 --> 41:42.333
I'll leave my guards outside
until I return.

41:42.416 --> 41:43.375
I'll be waiting.

42:01.060 --> 42:03.979
[door opens and closes]

42:10.528 --> 42:11.362
Come with me.

42:11.445 --> 42:13.489
Baghra! What are you…

42:13.572 --> 42:16.909
Stupid girl! No time to dawdle.

42:17.535 --> 42:18.494
[Alina] No!

42:18.577 --> 42:20.079
You need to leave this place.

42:20.162 --> 42:21.872
What? Why?

42:23.999 --> 42:26.085
-Now, before it's too late.
-But, Baghra--

42:26.168 --> 42:29.213
I'm trying to save you from living
the rest of your life as a slave.

42:31.924 --> 42:34.802
A slave? But… Baghra!

42:35.553 --> 42:39.640
Whatever's wrong, I should go back
and find Alek… General Kirigan.

42:39.723 --> 42:41.100
I'm sure he can help.

42:41.183 --> 42:43.602
I'm trying to save you from Aleksander.

42:47.231 --> 42:50.484
He intends to expand the Fold
and use it as a weapon.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.945
That's what he created it for
in the first place.

42:53.028 --> 42:54.780
The Black Heretic created the Fold.

42:54.863 --> 42:56.782
Hundreds of years ago,
and it was a mistake.

42:56.865 --> 42:59.285
Maybe you're dehydrated
from all the heat in your hut.

42:59.368 --> 43:01.453
He wanted me to train
so I could get stronger.

43:01.537 --> 43:06.250
Did he? Or did he want you distracted
by dreams of your future with him?

43:06.333 --> 43:10.713
Did he want you dependent on him,
on his Fabrikator's tricky little gloves?

43:11.964 --> 43:13.716
No. No!

43:13.799 --> 43:17.469
Child, Aleksander is the Black Heretic.

43:18.721 --> 43:22.057
He chose a nobleman's name
to hide after he made the Fold.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.018
You're lying.

43:24.101 --> 43:24.935
Look at me, girl.

43:30.691 --> 43:33.569
You can… But only Kirigan's bloodline…

43:37.364 --> 43:38.574
You're his mother.

43:38.657 --> 43:42.995
My son tried creating
his own army with merzost.

43:43.078 --> 43:45.331
He didn't think
about the people who lived there,

43:45.414 --> 43:47.124
what such power would do to them.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.502
Turned them into the twisted,
evil things that attacked you.

43:53.047 --> 43:54.089
The volcra were men?

43:54.173 --> 43:56.508
And women. Children.

43:58.093 --> 44:00.179
I warned him there'd be a price.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.562
[Alina] That happened centuries ago!

44:08.646 --> 44:12.274
He's had many names, served many kings,

44:12.941 --> 44:16.028
faked countless deaths, waiting for you.

44:20.157 --> 44:22.826
With you at his command,
he'll be able to enter the Fold

44:22.910 --> 44:24.745
and weaponize it as he always planned.

44:24.828 --> 44:26.872
He'll be unstoppable.

44:26.955 --> 44:29.208
He told me he wanted
to make the country whole again.

44:29.291 --> 44:32.711
He's had centuries
to master lying to naive girls.

44:32.795 --> 44:37.466
Did he tell you how lonely he was?
Give you a glimpse of the wounded boy?

44:38.842 --> 44:42.471
He isn't a boy at all. He is eternal.

44:42.554 --> 44:44.431
And you never stood a chance.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.517
Do you think this was just about you?

44:47.476 --> 44:49.144
He's been obsessed with power…

44:50.479 --> 44:53.232
with hunting all of Morozova's creatures.

44:53.315 --> 44:55.692
You nearly gave him the Stag.

44:58.278 --> 45:01.448
And I'm telling you, you must hide.

45:10.707 --> 45:12.876
I won't help him. I'll fight back.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.837
You're far from strong enough to face him.

45:14.920 --> 45:18.257
I thought I had more time to prepare you,
but it'll have to wait.

45:47.744 --> 45:50.998
[Baghra] Stay on the main path
until the fork.

45:53.125 --> 45:57.671
Take the path to the right.
You'll find food storage. Wait there.

45:58.672 --> 46:01.258
There are some Grisha who are loyal to me.

46:01.341 --> 46:04.845
They will help keep you safe
until I find a plan.

46:38.670 --> 46:43.342
You're not supposed to be here,
are you, limping man?

46:45.177 --> 46:46.470
[shuffling footsteps]

46:54.728 --> 46:57.773
You're like a wounded spider in my house.

46:58.857 --> 47:02.027
You know what
my sister and I do to spiders?

47:05.572 --> 47:06.490
[grunts]

47:07.950 --> 47:09.201
[groaning]

47:09.284 --> 47:12.829
Unlike a spider, I only need one good leg.

47:12.913 --> 47:13.789
However, you…

47:13.872 --> 47:15.332
[screaming]

47:16.542 --> 47:18.001
…look like you need both hands.

47:18.085 --> 47:19.878
-[grunts and groans]
-[bone cracking]

47:24.633 --> 47:25.717
[grunts]

47:31.348 --> 47:32.474
[groans]

47:34.142 --> 47:35.519
Wrong.

48:08.260 --> 48:09.261
[inhales shakily]

48:09.344 --> 48:10.554
[guard] This way!

48:12.014 --> 48:12.848
We need to go.

48:15.309 --> 48:18.604
I… I killed him.

48:19.187 --> 48:20.564
[Kaz] Inej, look at me.

48:21.148 --> 48:22.274
Look at me.

48:24.568 --> 48:25.861
You saved my life.

48:28.363 --> 48:29.906
Get your Saint and let's go.

48:30.907 --> 48:32.326
-[guard] In here!
-[sniffles]

48:37.205 --> 48:40.125
-[guard 1] He's over there!
-[guard 2] Quickly! Get in there!

49:09.655 --> 49:10.489
Alina?

49:19.373 --> 49:20.749
[horses snorting]

49:41.728 --> 49:42.813
He's not here.

49:44.731 --> 49:45.607
Who?

49:46.441 --> 49:49.486
The tracker. Yes, I know about him.

49:50.529 --> 49:52.030
And your little mission.

49:54.658 --> 49:55.826
What have you done with him?

49:56.576 --> 49:57.786
Disposed of.

49:59.121 --> 50:01.373
Along with your hopes
of locating the Stag.

50:01.456 --> 50:06.545
I always have hope, Mother.
Even you can't kill that.

50:09.131 --> 50:12.759
That isn't hope. It's greed.

50:14.219 --> 50:16.847
You would use Alina
against the rest of the world.

50:17.848 --> 50:20.058
You mean against our enemies?

50:22.185 --> 50:24.688
Without me, there's just her.

50:25.397 --> 50:26.398
Standing alone.

50:27.482 --> 50:29.943
She is all that matters now, not me.

50:30.026 --> 50:31.653
She is the future.

50:31.737 --> 50:34.614
-She is the one--
-Yes, but where is she?

50:38.285 --> 50:39.119
Careful.

50:41.204 --> 50:43.373
You don't really matter
now anymore either.

50:45.375 --> 50:47.294
And if you have put her in harm's way…

50:52.299 --> 50:53.967
think about what I might do.

50:58.930 --> 51:01.892
I'd wager you'd need
a skilled tracker to find her now.

51:03.894 --> 51:04.728
Pity.

51:17.032 --> 51:18.116
[sighs]

51:18.200 --> 51:19.743
[door creaking]

51:50.398 --> 51:52.150
[laughing softly]

51:53.151 --> 51:54.528
[footsteps approaching]

52:00.992 --> 52:02.285
What happened? You okay?

52:02.369 --> 52:06.498
She's real, Jesper.
She made the light sing.

52:09.167 --> 52:10.377
We lost her.

52:11.419 --> 52:12.295
Did we?

52:13.505 --> 52:14.840
We don't know where she is.

52:15.882 --> 52:17.551
Don't we? [laughs]

52:18.176 --> 52:19.469
Just ask.

52:19.553 --> 52:20.595
Jesper…

52:20.679 --> 52:22.013
Just ask.

52:34.943 --> 52:35.777
Just ask.

52:37.404 --> 52:41.491
Fine. Do we have a fix
on where the target is?

52:46.621 --> 52:47.956
[horses neigh]
