00:20.284 --> 00:21.524
New bush?
Since when?

00:21.559 --> 00:23.526
Don't mind me, Marlene.

00:23.561 --> 00:25.895
I'm just a happy little shrub.

00:25.930 --> 00:27.965
Private, what are you doing?

00:27.999 --> 00:31.368
Camouflage training.
If I move a single muscle, the

00:31.402 --> 00:35.138
game's up so just pretend I'm
not here, okay?

00:35.173 --> 00:37.906
Okay.
Oh, and Private?

00:37.941 --> 00:40.176
You're selling it.
Good job.

00:40.210 --> 00:42.211
Thanks, Mar--

00:45.715 --> 00:48.317
- Direct hit!
- Booya!

00:52.422 --> 00:53.555
Oops.

00:53.556 --> 00:57.425
Sweet collateral damage!
They touched down in the park.

00:57.460 --> 01:01.530
Private, where are you?
Fall in, soldier.

01:01.564 --> 01:03.298
Ah, there you are.

01:03.332 --> 01:05.701
Yes, but where's Marlene?

01:09.471 --> 01:12.006
Oh, yes.
Because she was born in

01:12.040 --> 01:14.942
captivity, when Marlene leaves
the confines of the zoo, she

01:14.977 --> 01:18.178
goes, and this is a technical
term--

01:19.748 --> 01:21.281
Oh, right, forgot about that.

01:21.316 --> 01:24.485
Hey, Rico, see if you can...
stamble toward the zoo.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.962
Just a few more agonizing
feet, Rico.

01:35.997 --> 01:37.096
What's up, Rico?

01:37.131 --> 01:39.365
Hey, did I go all feral again?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.400
Um... just a bit.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.470
No need to fret, Marlene.

01:45.505 --> 01:48.974
You're back in the safe,
civilizing environs of the zoo.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.475
Wait, how did I get out?

01:50.510 --> 01:53.746
That is a complete and total
mystery, one we intend to

01:53.780 --> 01:55.113
thoroughly investigate.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.114
Mm-hm.
You guys did it, huh?

01:57.149 --> 01:58.149
Marlene, it would be

01:58.183 --> 02:01.285
premature to speculate at this
early phase.

02:02.721 --> 02:04.689
Badgers!

02:04.723 --> 02:07.391
Yep, we've known they were
coming for weeks.

02:07.426 --> 02:09.426
We've been trying to find a
good time to tell you.

02:09.461 --> 02:10.695
I guess now is it.

02:10.729 --> 02:13.964
Request permission to go
hide in my bunk... forever.

02:13.998 --> 02:15.165
Denied.

02:15.199 --> 02:18.001
It's high time you got over
this silly fear, Private.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.241
family Mustelidae.

02:25.276 --> 02:27.778
Exactly, and you're not
afraid of me, are you?

02:27.812 --> 02:29.879
In the zoo
or out of the zoo?

02:29.913 --> 02:31.981
You're funny.
Come on!

02:32.015 --> 02:32.982
No, no!

02:33.016 --> 02:34.984
I don't want to meet the
badgers!

02:35.018 --> 02:36.986
There is nothing to be
afraid of.

02:37.020 --> 02:40.690
Okay, okay, you're right.
Badgers are nice and friendly

02:40.724 --> 02:42.324
and they probably don't even

02:42.358 --> 02:46.294
have 6-inch flesh-rending
incisors. Let me go!

02:46.328 --> 02:49.397
No, no. We are gonna go
through with this.

02:52.802 --> 02:54.535
Is it me or is this badger

02:54.570 --> 02:59.608
habitat surprisingly low on
badgers?

02:59.642 --> 03:01.909
In there.

03:04.980 --> 03:07.948
- Honey, we have visitors!
- Visitors? Sweet!

03:07.983 --> 03:10.350
- Super sweet.
- Super sugary sweet.

03:10.384 --> 03:11.785
Hey, I'm Marlene.

03:11.820 --> 03:13.887
- Marlene, I'm Becky.
- And I'm Stacy.

03:13.922 --> 03:16.923
- Correct me if I'm wrong, but--
- Otter.

03:16.957 --> 03:18.925
- Hey, spoiler alert!
- Sorry, got excited.

03:18.959 --> 03:19.926
Yeah, yeah, I'm an otter.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.928
So, you're practically our
cousin.

03:21.962 --> 03:23.028
- Family!
- Family!

03:23.062 --> 03:24.696
Yeah, family.

03:25.965 --> 03:27.165
And this little cutie?

03:27.199 --> 03:29.167
Becky, I've seen them in
books.

03:29.201 --> 03:31.236
- Glossy magazines.
- TV shows.

03:31.270 --> 03:33.872
- DVDs.
- And TV shows on DVD!

03:33.906 --> 03:35.340
That is a penguin!

03:35.374 --> 03:38.610
Yes, I'm a penguin.
Let's get on with it!

03:38.644 --> 03:41.746
Devour me with your
flesh-rending incisors already!

03:41.780 --> 03:42.747
Devour?

03:43.815 --> 03:45.916
Flesh-rending incisors?

03:45.951 --> 03:51.288
Private is just maybe
a little bit terrified of you guys.

03:51.322 --> 03:54.658
Well, that's a shame because
I've got this peanut butter

03:54.692 --> 03:57.326
winkie here and nobody
to share it with.

03:57.361 --> 04:01.330
Peanut... butter...
winkie?

04:04.434 --> 04:06.002
Mm-mm, good winkie.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.003
Belly up, bud.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.005
There's more where
that came from.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.006
Oh, my!
Winkies everywhere!

04:11.041 --> 04:13.208
Marlene, can you guys stay
for lunch?

04:13.242 --> 04:16.244
Please say yes, please say
yes, please say yes!

04:18.648 --> 04:20.649
Okay, yes.

04:45.539 --> 04:47.074
See you soon, cousin!

04:47.108 --> 04:49.009
Right back at you, cousin.

04:49.043 --> 04:51.011
Okay.

04:51.045 --> 04:54.480
Was I so right and you so wrong
or what?

04:54.515 --> 04:55.749
All right, okay, I admit it.

04:55.783 --> 04:57.617
I was a silly billy dingdong.

04:57.651 --> 04:58.818
Okay, not the words I would

04:58.852 --> 05:02.855
choose but yeah, I embrace the
spirit. Yes, yes.

05:06.693 --> 05:08.861
Hey, cousin.
Late night snack attack?

05:08.895 --> 05:11.430
Caramel corn and boysenberry
smoothies.

05:11.464 --> 05:13.465
- So yum!
- So yum!

05:15.901 --> 05:20.872
Spontaneous slumber party!
Woo!

05:25.277 --> 05:27.145
Let's go hang gliding!

05:27.179 --> 05:29.680
Okay, let me down.
Okay, let me down.

05:29.915 --> 05:31.648
Okay, let me down.
Okay, let me down.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.458
Who's up for a game
of Simon says?

05:41.492 --> 05:42.926
Ooh, ooh, I'm Simon!

05:42.961 --> 05:46.630
No!  I mean, it's late.
I think I'll pass.

05:46.664 --> 05:48.631
I didn't say "Simon says."

05:48.665 --> 05:50.633
- You didn't say anything.
- I know.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.635
I don't think she gets this
game at all.

05:52.669 --> 05:54.637
Seriously, guys, I'm
exhausted.

05:54.671 --> 05:55.638
Okay.

05:55.672 --> 05:57.640
But we'll see you tomorrow,
right, cousin?

05:57.674 --> 05:58.641
We've got a full day planned.

05:58.675 --> 05:59.642
Don't want to give away too

05:59.676 --> 06:01.644
much, but spontaneous
scavenger hunt!

06:01.678 --> 06:03.011
Shh, you didn't hear from us.

06:03.045 --> 06:05.013
Because then it wouldn't be
spontaneous.

06:05.047 --> 06:07.949
Okay, well, we'll see, guys.
Maybe.

06:07.984 --> 06:10.318
Please say yes, please say
yes, please say yes!

06:10.352 --> 06:13.354
Oh my gosh, will you guys
stop "badgering" me?

06:15.091 --> 06:16.724
Badger?

06:16.759 --> 06:18.793
Oh, I wish you hadn't said
that.

06:18.827 --> 06:20.795
Is that what you think
badgers do, Marlene?

06:20.829 --> 06:21.796
Badger?

06:21.830 --> 06:24.131
I so didn't mean it that way.
I'm so sorry.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.633
You said it, Marlene, so you
must have meant it.

06:26.668 --> 06:28.635
Calm, Becky.
Find your happy space.

06:28.670 --> 06:31.105
She didn't mean to spew hateful
badger stereotypes.

06:31.139 --> 06:33.174
You think badgers badger,
Marlene?

06:33.208 --> 06:35.175
Huh, do you?
Do you, do you, do you?

06:35.209 --> 06:37.143
No, no.
I was just saying I don't want

06:37.178 --> 06:39.545
to play anymore silly games,
that's all.

06:39.579 --> 06:40.880
Silly?

06:42.183 --> 06:44.951
I had them all wrong.
I mean, Stacy and Becky are

06:44.985 --> 06:47.386
regular folks just like
you and me.

06:49.489 --> 06:50.856
Well, me.

06:50.890 --> 06:53.625
Anyway, in the end, there's
nothing to fear.

06:53.659 --> 06:55.093
Hide me, hide me!

06:55.128 --> 06:56.094
The badgers are gonna shred me!

06:56.129 --> 06:58.163
They're gonna shred me to
pieces!

06:58.198 --> 07:01.466
I was right!
Never trust a badger!

07:01.500 --> 07:03.802
And then they said when they
were finished, even my own

07:03.837 --> 07:06.038
mother wouldn't recognize what
was left.

07:06.072 --> 07:08.272
Now, now, that won't happen.

07:08.307 --> 07:10.808
Yes, your right foot is very
distinctive.

07:10.843 --> 07:14.511
Your mother would surely
recognize that.

07:14.546 --> 07:18.249
And also, we are going to help
you.

07:18.283 --> 07:20.517
Nice recovery, Kowalski.

07:20.552 --> 07:24.120
Video surveillance, laser
beam barrier, barbed wire.

07:24.155 --> 07:27.023
And an old-fashioned tripline
connected to a bell.

07:28.759 --> 07:29.960
That's a lot of stuff.

07:29.994 --> 07:31.862
Take this garlic clove.

07:31.896 --> 07:34.630
It works off evil badger
spirits.

07:34.665 --> 07:36.532
Now, sleep easy, Marlene.

07:36.567 --> 07:38.701
This security net is
impenetrable.

07:38.736 --> 07:41.436
Thanks.
I feel better already.

07:41.471 --> 07:46.876
Great, then we can knock off
early. Roll out, men.

07:48.144 --> 07:50.812
Garlic.
Those guys.

07:50.847 --> 07:54.250
What's so funny, Marlene?

07:55.351 --> 07:57.451
<i>You hear a joke?</i>

07:57.486 --> 07:58.786
A silly joke?

07:58.820 --> 08:00.855
A silly badger joke?

08:00.890 --> 08:02.023
A silly badger joke about

08:02.057 --> 08:04.759
garlic and how it wards off
evil badger spirits?

08:04.793 --> 08:05.894
You heard that one too?

08:05.928 --> 08:08.129
It's kind of funny, right?

08:08.163 --> 08:09.130
No!

08:09.164 --> 08:11.598
It's just another insulting
badger stereotype.

08:11.632 --> 08:12.966
Insulting and untrue.

08:13.001 --> 08:14.067
You sure?

08:14.102 --> 08:17.070
I don't know, there might be
something to it!

08:20.909 --> 08:21.875
It's the badgers!

08:21.910 --> 08:24.011
Hurry!

08:24.045 --> 08:26.813
Um, you three go ahead.
I've got an idea.

08:26.847 --> 08:29.048
Sure you do, Private.

08:29.082 --> 08:31.183
No, really, I'm working on
something!

08:31.218 --> 08:36.054
Okay, that doesn't sound
chicken-y at all.

08:36.089 --> 08:38.657
Help!

08:38.691 --> 08:41.928
Halt, stubby-legged mam--

08:41.962 --> 08:45.430
Kowalski, Rico!
Sticky situation scenario.

08:58.444 --> 09:00.877
- Uh-oh.
- Out of ammo, Skipper.

09:00.912 --> 09:04.915
- Sorry.
- Blast! Give chase, men!

09:28.973 --> 09:31.507
Nowhere to run now, cousin.

09:31.541 --> 09:33.241
Who's going to save you now?

09:33.276 --> 09:35.845
I don't know but I do have
a question.

09:35.879 --> 09:38.146
What's that bush doing here?

09:38.181 --> 09:41.249
This!

09:44.420 --> 09:46.922
Hm?

09:51.627 --> 09:56.364
Uh-oh.
I'm outside.

09:56.398 --> 09:58.700
Wow, nothing gets past you,
does it?

09:58.734 --> 10:01.652
I'm...

10:01.653 --> 10:03.570
<i>O-outside!</i>

10:07.008 --> 10:08.876
That is so wrong.

10:11.479 --> 10:15.782
Stace, I think maybe we
should... run!

10:15.817 --> 10:17.851
Please don't hurt me, please
don't hurt me!

10:24.958 --> 10:27.660
Nice anti-badger measure,
Private.

10:27.694 --> 10:28.794
Thanks, Skipper.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.197
I didn't quite plan for them to
actually take Marlene.

10:31.232 --> 10:32.932
Well, it's working anyway.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.001
Shouldn't we do something,
Skipper?

10:35.036 --> 10:37.002
It's a family matter,
Kowalski.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.004
There's no way I'm getting in
the middle of that.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.946
Smashing good picnic.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.682
I'm so glad we're all friends
again.

10:50.716 --> 10:52.017
Forgive and forget.

10:52.051 --> 10:54.185
Can't imagine it any other
way.
