WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:04.486
Yes!
Yeah.

00:04.572 --> 00:05.704
Ah!
Ooh.

00:05.789 --> 00:07.456
Thank you.

00:07.491 --> 00:08.740
Are you kidding me?

00:08.826 --> 00:10.409
No, thank <i> you.</i>

00:10.494 --> 00:12.995
Ha, well, I'm a giver.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.080
Yeah, you are.

00:19.169 --> 00:20.836
Wet spot.

00:29.013 --> 00:30.846
Hey!
Hey.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.648
You switched sides?

00:32.683 --> 00:34.566
Uh, you know, my phone charger
only works on this side,

00:34.652 --> 00:36.518
so this is kind of my spot.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.519
Your spot?

00:37.605 --> 00:39.321
Yeah.

00:39.356 --> 00:41.239
You sure you're not trying
to avoid <i> this</i> spot?

00:41.325 --> 00:42.446
I mean, that's cool with me.

00:42.526 --> 00:43.742
I don't have a problem
with, you know, like,

00:43.827 --> 00:46.028
your excretions and stuff.

00:46.113 --> 00:47.914
Wow! You make it sound
like it's a sea urchin!

00:47.915 --> 00:49.114
Wait, oh, okay, um...

00:49.199 --> 00:50.032
juices?

00:50.117 --> 00:51.199
And now it's a breakfast buffet?

00:51.285 --> 00:52.751
What do you want me to say?
I don't know!

00:52.836 --> 00:53.869
That's definitely you.
Hold on a second here.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.704
If we're talking
about the "us cocktail,"

00:55.789 --> 00:57.039
I think we're talking

00:57.091 --> 01:00.425
90% Libby with a ten percent
Pete floater, tops.

01:00.511 --> 01:02.210
A Pete floater?
Oh, yeah.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.129
Okay, well, then, Pete?
Mm-hmm.

01:04.214 --> 01:06.214
Why don't you float
back over here?

01:06.266 --> 01:07.883
I ain't float... I'm not floating on that.
Oh, yeah, you can.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.184
You can do it. Oh, come on.
Why...?

01:09.219 --> 01:10.936
I know you can, I know.
I don't want the wet spot!

01:11.021 --> 01:13.388
You know what?
Oh, you love that juice cocktail.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.057
Oh, man, you're
lucky I like you a ton.

01:16.393 --> 01:18.760
Floating on my floater.

01:18.880 --> 01:23.998
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:24.118 --> 01:26.952
Juices? Oh, no! No!
No, no, no.

01:27.037 --> 01:29.037
What's wrong with that?
What are you gonna call it?

01:29.073 --> 01:30.288
How about bitters?
Or a spritz?

01:30.374 --> 01:32.124
No, those are mixology terms.

01:32.209 --> 01:33.709
That's why
I call it "love foam."

01:34.795 --> 01:35.794
That is horrific.

01:35.879 --> 01:37.379
I'm sticking with juices.

01:37.414 --> 01:38.747
Come on, what is it
with you guys?

01:38.832 --> 01:39.881
Every week is the same thing.

01:39.917 --> 01:41.717
Talk about a bodily function

01:41.752 --> 01:43.085
and try to find a term for it.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.586
It's getting redundant.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.388
Well, Jenny and I don't have
to worry about the wet spot,

01:46.423 --> 01:48.390
because she makes
me wear a condom.

01:48.425 --> 01:49.257
Oh!
What?

01:49.343 --> 01:50.509
You're married.

01:50.594 --> 01:52.427
We wear it for birth
control purposes.

01:52.513 --> 01:53.512
Why doesn't she take the pill?

01:53.597 --> 01:54.763
Because she's allergic to it.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.431
They all say
they're allergic to it.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.197
She's allergic to it.
She's allergic to it.

01:58.268 --> 01:59.317
That's what they say,
"She's allergic to it."

01:59.403 --> 02:00.435
She's "allergic."

02:00.521 --> 02:02.354
All allergic to the pill.

02:02.439 --> 02:03.989
She's allergic
to the pill, Ruxin!

02:04.074 --> 02:05.941
Why don't you just man up, dude?

02:06.026 --> 02:07.466
What do you to clean
up the wet spot?

02:07.528 --> 02:09.244
Sofia makes me put a towel down.

02:09.279 --> 02:10.946
Whoa, you showed her, buddy.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.414
You guys are going
about this all wrong, okay?

02:12.449 --> 02:14.499
You have to embrace
the wet spot.

02:14.585 --> 02:16.118
Do what I do--
I sleep <i> in</i> it.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.036
Like a pig who lives
in his own slop.

02:18.122 --> 02:19.287
In this case, Meegan's slop.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.756
Is the Andre and Meegan thing

02:20.791 --> 02:22.124
gonna replace
the Pete and Kevin thing?

02:22.176 --> 02:24.342
No, I look at it as an addition

02:24.428 --> 02:26.128
to a beautiful house
that I'm building over time.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.630
The real issue for me here is,
no one knows who's responsible

02:28.682 --> 02:30.298
for this and who
should sleep in it.

02:30.350 --> 02:31.633
Like, is it mostly
the guy's juices?

02:31.685 --> 02:32.968
Or is mostly the women's stuff?

02:33.053 --> 02:35.137
Well, are you having
multiple orgasms?

02:35.189 --> 02:36.221
You mean, like,
we have sex multiple times?

02:36.306 --> 02:37.556
No, I mean, how many times

02:37.641 --> 02:39.566
do you come in a row
while you're having sex?

02:39.686 --> 02:41.398
I come once.

02:41.518 --> 02:44.281
Oh, like once for, like 45 minutes?

02:44.333 --> 02:45.749
No, I have sex and
I come for, like,

02:45.784 --> 02:46.917
two seconds, like, in a climax,

02:46.952 --> 02:48.168
like a normal person.

02:48.253 --> 02:49.836
Dude, that's grade school sex.

02:49.922 --> 02:51.621
I'm out of here.

02:51.707 --> 02:54.374
45 minutes-- who has that time?

02:54.460 --> 02:56.380
Oh, guess who came
into the office the other day.

02:56.428 --> 02:57.961
Who?
Frank "The Body" Gibiatti.

02:59.465 --> 03:00.764
Is he finally transitioning?

03:00.799 --> 03:01.848
He's dating this Russian girl

03:01.934 --> 03:03.049
and he wants
to get her boobs done.

03:03.135 --> 03:04.551
He wants them bigger,
like a D cup.

03:04.636 --> 03:07.137
And he wants them to have that
little, like, up-turn thing?

03:07.189 --> 03:08.305
What is that thing? Wha...?

03:08.390 --> 03:09.055
Ski jump?

03:09.141 --> 03:09.973
Like, a scoop.

03:10.058 --> 03:11.441
Oh, like a soup ladle.

03:11.477 --> 03:13.193
He calls it "a Jacksonville
strip club waitress."

03:13.278 --> 03:14.778
It's not bad.

03:14.813 --> 03:15.812
That's pretty good.
Not bad, but that's too vague.

03:15.864 --> 03:17.814
Guys, this game is awesome!

03:17.866 --> 03:19.149
I love it.

03:19.234 --> 03:20.567
What are you guys talking about?

03:20.652 --> 03:23.120
Oh, we were just talking
about that little uptick

03:23.155 --> 03:24.821
on a woman's breast
and how to, uh...

03:24.873 --> 03:26.740
What do you call...?
What to call the...

03:26.825 --> 03:29.209
Come on, it's just pathetic.

03:32.331 --> 03:33.380
Half pipe!

03:33.465 --> 03:34.305
Yes. Yes.
That's good.

03:34.333 --> 03:35.499
'Cause it comes...

03:50.232 --> 03:52.399
<i>Hola, Ruxin.</i>

03:52.484 --> 03:53.984
Taco Tuesday--
how do you like it?

03:54.019 --> 03:55.152
More like Tetanus Tuesday.

03:55.187 --> 03:56.820
I need my own personal meal.

03:56.855 --> 03:58.572
What, you got a problem
with family style?

03:58.657 --> 03:59.778
That's how we do it up here.

03:59.858 --> 04:01.441
I don't want to dig
in the trough

04:01.527 --> 04:03.026
with these hooved
stink sprinklers.

04:03.111 --> 04:04.361
Oh, don't be such a wuss, man.

04:04.413 --> 04:06.163
I spent six years in
a fraternity house, all right?

04:06.198 --> 04:08.365
One time I took one of those
little marshmallow Peeps,

04:08.450 --> 04:10.584
and I crinkled it up
into this tiny little ball,

04:10.669 --> 04:12.169
and I shoved it up
a pledge's butt.

04:12.204 --> 04:14.037
And then I made him
fart it into my mouth.

04:14.122 --> 04:16.373
Taught him a lesson that day.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.791
And they say that frat
guys are secretly gay.

04:18.877 --> 04:20.093
Right?

04:20.178 --> 04:22.179
Look, I need my
own personal lunch.

04:22.214 --> 04:23.763
Well, you can
forget that, amigo.

04:23.849 --> 04:25.249
Because, unless you got
some sort of

04:25.267 --> 04:27.551
no-kidding
dietary restriction,

04:27.603 --> 04:29.469
like a religious problem
or some sort of wussy allergy,

04:29.555 --> 04:30.887
it ain't happening.

04:30.939 --> 04:32.889
Well, I am a...

04:32.941 --> 04:34.524
Jewish kosher person

04:34.560 --> 04:36.193
and I need a kosher meal.

04:36.228 --> 04:38.778
Whoa.
I knew you were Jewish,

04:38.864 --> 04:40.230
but I didn't know you were,
like,<i> Jewish</i> Jewish.

04:40.315 --> 04:41.698
What is that supposed to mean?

04:41.733 --> 04:43.400
You know, like, uh, like, uh,

04:43.485 --> 04:45.202
Jewish-Hanukkah Jewish.

04:45.237 --> 04:47.821
Not like, you know,
Jewish-beard Jewish.

04:47.906 --> 04:49.739
With all the internal
lawsuits that this law firm

04:49.825 --> 04:51.324
has recently dealt with,

04:51.410 --> 04:54.411
I would recommend that
you listen to my needs.

04:54.463 --> 04:57.330
And let's never forget
what happened in Germany.

04:57.416 --> 05:00.166
Oh, right, the company
retreat-- I get it!

05:00.252 --> 05:01.718
Cash bar at the final dinner?

05:01.753 --> 05:03.470
I thought the dollar
was strong against the Euro.

05:03.555 --> 05:04.838
I thought I was doing
everybody a favor!

05:04.923 --> 05:05.672
Well, you weren't.

05:05.757 --> 05:06.673
All right.

05:06.758 --> 05:08.058
You get a kosher meal.

05:08.093 --> 05:09.643
Good.
Then...

05:09.728 --> 05:10.927
let's consider this a shalom.

05:11.013 --> 05:12.929
Shalom.

05:13.015 --> 05:14.231
And super shalom.

05:14.266 --> 05:15.565
Yeah, do it.
Uh, uh...

05:17.769 --> 05:20.270
<i>Wait a second.</i>

05:20.355 --> 05:21.187
Are you forgetting something?

05:21.273 --> 05:22.272
Ah, the clitoris!

05:22.357 --> 05:23.406
Mm, yes.

05:23.442 --> 05:24.941
The jewel of the South.

05:25.027 --> 05:27.527
Yes, yes.
Where are you, my little friend?

05:27.613 --> 05:28.778
And a condom.

05:28.830 --> 05:30.614
Aw, no, babe!
Really?

05:30.699 --> 05:31.948
Seriously, Kevin?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.400
Every time we have
to wear a condom?

05:33.418 --> 05:36.419
Yes, every time
we have to wear a condom.

05:36.455 --> 05:38.288
What if we just saw what
happens, play it by ear?

05:38.340 --> 05:40.373
My ear can't get pregnant.

05:40.459 --> 05:42.626
What if you drank caffeine
the entire pregnancy

05:42.711 --> 05:45.762
and then just had
a very small manageable child?

05:45.797 --> 05:48.298
Oh, my God, you just proved
why you're not father material.

05:48.350 --> 05:49.516
I'm getting a condom.

05:49.601 --> 05:51.551
Oh, really?

05:51.637 --> 05:53.553
Oh, it's our last one.

05:53.639 --> 05:54.888
Gonna have to buy some more.

05:54.973 --> 05:56.273
I do not want to buy condoms.

05:56.308 --> 05:57.807
It is, it is so embarrassing.

05:57.859 --> 05:58.975
You don't feel
weird and embarrassed

05:59.027 --> 05:59.976
when you go down that aisle?

06:00.062 --> 06:01.478
No, I don't feel weird.

06:01.530 --> 06:02.946
I-I buy your clothes.

06:02.981 --> 06:04.864
This is just, like,
clothes for your dick.

06:04.950 --> 06:07.367
So, get dressed.

06:07.452 --> 06:09.119
It's like an itchy Christmas sweater.
Aw.

06:11.823 --> 06:13.156
I just don't want to eat

06:13.208 --> 06:15.158
family-style lunch
with these people.

06:15.243 --> 06:16.923
They're not my family,
so why should I have

06:16.995 --> 06:19.245
a "style" lunch with
a bunch of garbage monsters.

06:19.331 --> 06:20.997
Ruxin, you're
pretending to be kosher.

06:21.049 --> 06:23.083
I'm pretty sure
that sends you to Jewish hell.

06:23.168 --> 06:24.334
No, I looked it up on Wikipedia.

06:24.386 --> 06:25.502
There is no Jewish hell.

06:25.554 --> 06:27.220
He shoots, he scores!
Whoa!

06:27.306 --> 06:28.888
Still undefeated!

06:28.974 --> 06:30.223
Not bad, Taco.

06:30.309 --> 06:31.641
You guys should consider
taking up the sport.

06:31.677 --> 06:33.476
It's about we find something
we can all do together.

06:33.512 --> 06:35.512
Taco, we all play
in a league together.

06:35.564 --> 06:37.125
No, I mean, like,
a real group activity.

06:37.149 --> 06:38.315
Something competitive.

06:38.350 --> 06:39.649
All right, who's up next?

06:39.685 --> 06:41.484
Not me. I'm out.
Nah, I'm good, thanks.

06:41.520 --> 06:42.602
I'll play.

06:42.688 --> 06:44.154
Why?
It's a mitzvah.

06:44.189 --> 06:46.523
Plus, I'm gonna wing it
as hard as I can at his head.

06:46.575 --> 06:47.691
All right, you start.

06:47.776 --> 06:49.909
Whoa!

06:49.995 --> 06:51.194
You're supposed to try
and get it in the hole.

06:51.246 --> 06:52.996
I was--
the one above your shoulders.

06:53.031 --> 06:54.664
Nowzick!
Frank the Body.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.282
Gibiatti.

06:56.368 --> 06:57.667
Oh, oh, hey!

06:57.703 --> 06:58.918
What's going on?
Oh, what's going on?

06:59.004 --> 07:00.203
I'll tell you.
We got some big problems.

07:00.255 --> 07:02.956
You massacred my
girlfriend's titties.

07:03.041 --> 07:05.258
What are you talking about?
<i>Da! Da!</i>

07:05.344 --> 07:06.710
You know what that means?
That's Russian for "yeah."

07:06.795 --> 07:08.345
"You messed up
my tits, dawg."

07:08.380 --> 07:09.546
Look at this.

07:09.631 --> 07:12.015
This one is perfect.

07:12.050 --> 07:13.883
This one is dog shit.

07:13.935 --> 07:16.302
And I'm bringing
this problem to you

07:16.388 --> 07:18.138
because you're the quack

07:18.223 --> 07:20.140
who underinflated her titties.

07:20.225 --> 07:21.558
Oh, I think we have a bit of

07:21.643 --> 07:23.560
a Deflategate scandal on our hands.
Yes.

07:23.645 --> 07:25.228
We do not have
a Deflategate scandal, okay?

07:25.280 --> 07:26.563
- I assure you...
- Well, hold on.

07:26.615 --> 07:28.815
Let's see what kind of PSI
we got going here.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.033
What are the standards?

07:30.068 --> 07:31.317
Three to four pounds
per square inch.

07:31.403 --> 07:32.902
Oh, do you measure them
or you just honk 'em?

07:32.954 --> 07:34.738
I do not "honk" breasts.

07:34.790 --> 07:36.239
I bet you honk dicks, though.

07:36.291 --> 07:37.657
I never have honked a dick.

07:37.743 --> 07:39.242
I don't honk breasts.

07:39.327 --> 07:40.543
I am a professional,

07:40.579 --> 07:42.545
and I can assure you
that her implants--

07:42.581 --> 07:45.081
your implants-- are within
the proper guidelines.

07:45.167 --> 07:47.167
You're a deflator.
<i>Da.</i>

07:47.252 --> 07:49.212
All right?
Okay, maybe you're too rough with them.

07:49.221 --> 07:52.088
Wha-- I am the most
gentle lover, bro,

07:52.140 --> 07:53.673
I caress them...
I find that hard to believe.

07:53.759 --> 07:55.508
How about I show you
a video right now, bro?

07:55.594 --> 07:57.677
No...
Nobody wants to see a video, Frank.

07:57.763 --> 07:58.803
14 seconds, I'm by myself.

07:58.847 --> 07:59.979
Just watch it.

08:00.065 --> 08:01.014
Oh, boy.
Hey, you know what?

08:01.099 --> 08:02.379
People like
different inflations.

08:02.434 --> 08:04.267
That's all. I like
a little under-deflated.

08:04.352 --> 08:05.685
Yeah.
I'm-I'm-I'm like Aaron Rodgers.

08:05.771 --> 08:07.187
I like to go overinflated,
myself.

08:07.272 --> 08:10.156
Look, I apologize if
there's any misunderstanding...

08:10.242 --> 08:11.825
Know what my lawyer's
doing right now?

08:11.910 --> 08:13.109
Studying the Torah.

08:13.161 --> 08:14.482
You know what he's
doing later on?

08:14.529 --> 08:15.662
Suing your ass!

08:15.747 --> 08:17.347
<i>Da!</i>

08:19.826 --> 08:21.686
<i> I don't want to buy the</i>
<i>condoms, babe. I can't do it.</i>

08:21.806 --> 08:23.106
All right, Kevin,

08:23.141 --> 08:24.724
I will get the condoms.
Fine.

08:24.809 --> 08:25.859
I'll get the razors.

08:25.944 --> 08:27.227
Great.
Teamwork!

08:31.233 --> 08:32.232
You're gonna buy
those cheap condoms?

08:33.702 --> 08:35.400
I would go with these
if I were you.

08:35.486 --> 08:36.152
You're Randall Cobb.

08:36.203 --> 08:36.870
I am.

08:36.955 --> 08:37.820
You are on my team.

08:37.905 --> 08:38.821
That's fantasy.

08:38.907 --> 08:40.123
Let's talk real life.

08:40.158 --> 08:41.791
A unplanned baby?
That's real.

08:41.826 --> 08:42.825
Uh, no.

08:42.910 --> 08:43.993
No, my husband and I,

08:44.078 --> 08:45.461
we are very smart
about these things.

08:45.497 --> 08:47.247
That guy?

08:47.332 --> 08:48.665
He doesn't look smart
about anything.

08:48.717 --> 08:50.667
I think you got
a baby daddy on your hands.

08:50.719 --> 08:52.468
You do?
Does he ask for condom cheat days?

08:52.504 --> 08:54.837
- Yeah. - Do you think having a baby
will fill a void for him?

08:54.890 --> 08:57.131
- Yes. - Do you know where
your kitchen turkey baster is?

08:57.142 --> 08:58.675
No.
Wow.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.009
Oh, no!

09:00.095 --> 09:01.394
What do I do?

09:01.479 --> 09:03.429
Don't let him handle
the condoms before sex.

09:03.515 --> 09:05.148
Really?
Yeah.

09:05.183 --> 09:06.599
A lot of people are trying to
poke holes in 'em these days.

09:06.685 --> 09:07.267
No!

09:07.352 --> 09:08.851
Oh... oh!

09:08.904 --> 09:10.436
Now I got you.
Now I got you.

09:10.522 --> 09:12.021
Do you know that
you're my number one

09:12.073 --> 09:13.189
wide receiver on my team?

09:13.241 --> 09:14.073
Oh, really?

09:14.159 --> 09:15.241
All the guys were, like,

09:15.327 --> 09:16.526
totally slot-shaming me.

09:18.530 --> 09:20.196
But it's, like, not fair at all,

09:20.282 --> 09:21.831
'cause when the guys
have all kinds of slots,

09:21.866 --> 09:22.832
they're players.

09:22.867 --> 09:23.866
But when the girls do...

09:23.919 --> 09:25.201
Double standard.
Yeah!

09:25.253 --> 09:26.369
That's all right.
You're a confident woman.

09:26.454 --> 09:28.705
Make your team as slotty
as you can get it.

09:28.757 --> 09:30.423
I'm gonna do that, Randall Cobb.

09:30.508 --> 09:32.091
Be slotty, but remember...

09:32.177 --> 09:33.459
be safe.

09:33.545 --> 09:35.929
Oh, got it!

09:37.766 --> 09:39.933
Ha-ha!
This is our best lunch ever!

09:40.018 --> 09:41.718
Where is my kosher meal?

09:41.803 --> 09:44.687
This is a callous disregard
for my religious beliefs.

09:44.723 --> 09:46.439
I feel like I am
being persecuted

09:46.524 --> 09:47.807
and I'm starving.

09:47.892 --> 09:49.642
I had a regular
breakfast this morning,

09:49.728 --> 09:50.860
but I worked out,

09:50.895 --> 09:52.228
so it feels like
I didn't eat anything.

09:52.280 --> 09:53.563
Take it easy, home team.

09:53.615 --> 09:54.731
Isn't today Yom Kippur?

09:54.783 --> 09:55.982
Aren't you

09:56.067 --> 09:56.988
supposed to be fasting?

09:57.068 --> 09:58.735
Yeah.

09:58.787 --> 10:01.070
That's why I've got
such low blood sugar

10:01.156 --> 10:04.040
and why I've just had
this justified outburst.

10:04.075 --> 10:05.908
Shalom.

10:09.748 --> 10:11.464
I'm so hungry.

10:17.422 --> 10:19.138
Wow.

10:19.224 --> 10:21.057
Cut the crap, Ruxin, all right?

10:21.092 --> 10:22.308
Everybody knows
you're not kosher.

10:22.394 --> 10:23.426
I'm very kosher.

10:23.478 --> 10:24.644
Are you kidding?

10:24.729 --> 10:26.012
I'm giving you the out!
Take the out!

10:26.097 --> 10:27.981
And I appreciate that,
but my religion prohibits...

10:28.066 --> 10:29.432
Oh, you know what?
Enough!

10:29.484 --> 10:31.517
It doesn't matter anyway.
You know why?

10:31.603 --> 10:32.935
This firm is about to land

10:32.988 --> 10:34.487
a major client,
Rabbi Shtotelman.

10:34.572 --> 10:36.939
His family, uh, created
the perforation of matzo.

10:37.025 --> 10:38.608
Anyway, they're suing
to protect their IP.

10:38.660 --> 10:41.828
You are gonna keep being
super Jewish and land this guy.

10:41.913 --> 10:43.112
Well, I will help you,

10:43.164 --> 10:44.447
as a member of this firm,

10:44.532 --> 10:46.499
to land Rabbi Shtotelman.
Yes!

10:46.584 --> 10:48.117
But, as a devout Jew...

10:48.203 --> 10:49.369
Enough.

10:49.454 --> 10:51.287
You got bacon bits
on your face, man.

10:51.373 --> 10:53.790
Give it a rest.

10:55.877 --> 10:57.510
<i>Oh, God!</i>

10:57.595 --> 10:58.961
Good job!

10:59.047 --> 11:00.013
Yeah, you did so good.

11:04.019 --> 11:05.968
That was good.
Yeah.

11:09.474 --> 11:11.274
What are you doing?

11:11.309 --> 11:12.975
Nothing.

11:13.061 --> 11:14.560
Uh, I just want to
be close to you, babe.

11:14.646 --> 11:16.646
Why? We just had sex.

11:16.731 --> 11:18.114
Just move over.
I have no room.

11:18.149 --> 11:19.230
No, babe, I'm...
Go, go, go!

11:19.284 --> 11:20.405
Stop, stop, stop!

11:20.452 --> 11:21.484
Stop it...
Oh!

11:21.569 --> 11:23.119
Kevin...

11:23.154 --> 11:24.120
what is that?

11:24.155 --> 11:25.121
Did you pee?

11:25.156 --> 11:26.155
I didn't pee.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.323
That is a wet spot.

11:27.409 --> 11:28.825
I don't know how that got there.

11:28.877 --> 11:30.326
Randall Cobb was right!

11:30.378 --> 11:32.078
You poked holes in this condom,
didn't you?

11:32.163 --> 11:33.403
What do you mean, Randall Cobb?

11:33.465 --> 11:34.664
When did-- where did
you see Randall Cobb?

11:34.716 --> 11:36.277
I was talking to him
at the drugstore...

11:36.334 --> 11:37.800
Are you kidding me?

11:37.836 --> 11:39.552
You met Randall Cobb
and you didn't introduce me?

11:39.637 --> 11:40.837
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:40.889 --> 11:42.255
You were slightly occupied

11:42.340 --> 11:43.389
when your hand was
trapped in that case

11:43.475 --> 11:44.424
like a bear trap.

11:44.509 --> 11:45.808
Randall Cobb told me

11:45.844 --> 11:47.310
that you had baby daddy drama

11:47.345 --> 11:48.978
written all over you.

11:49.013 --> 11:50.396
Randall Cobb doesn't know

11:50.482 --> 11:52.515
what's written
all over me, okay?

11:52.567 --> 11:54.067
Because I wore a condom.

11:54.152 --> 11:55.985
I did.
I dressed up my dick

11:56.020 --> 11:58.571
and I tied my dick laces
in double knots.

11:58.656 --> 11:59.656
Kevin...
All right? There.

11:59.691 --> 12:01.023
Where did you get these?

12:01.076 --> 12:01.991
I don't know.

12:02.026 --> 12:03.359
My freshman orientation package.

12:03.445 --> 12:05.578
God, how old are these, Kev...

12:05.663 --> 12:07.663
Kevin, these were made
in Yugoslavia.

12:07.699 --> 12:09.115
The good old days.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.450
They were made in a country

12:10.535 --> 12:12.502
that doesn't even
exist anymore, Kevin.

12:12.537 --> 12:14.921
Oh, so now I'm to blame
for the fall of Communism?

12:15.006 --> 12:16.873
What happened to the box
I bought you?

12:16.958 --> 12:18.291
I tried to open them,

12:18.376 --> 12:19.425
but I couldn't get
the cellophane open, babe.

12:19.511 --> 12:21.094
Look at these things.

12:21.179 --> 12:22.628
I was pawing at them, but
then a piece of cellophane

12:22.714 --> 12:23.629
got caught in
the back of my throat

12:23.715 --> 12:25.081
'cause I huffed it in...

12:25.150 --> 12:26.432
You tell me
what's harder, Kevin,

12:26.518 --> 12:28.301
opening a box of condoms

12:28.386 --> 12:29.552
or raising a third child?

12:29.604 --> 12:31.437
Harder for whom?

12:31.523 --> 12:32.972
Unbelievable.

12:33.057 --> 12:34.056
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wet spots!

12:34.142 --> 12:35.302
Wet spots everywhere!

12:35.310 --> 12:36.976
Yeah, Kevin.

12:37.061 --> 12:38.394
Wet spots everywhere!

12:38.446 --> 12:39.612
Oh...
Ew...

12:41.816 --> 12:43.399
I'm fine with not
having any more kids,

12:43.485 --> 12:44.817
I just don't want
to wear condoms.

12:44.903 --> 12:47.120
And I don't want any
baby daddy drama with him,

12:47.205 --> 12:50.289
so we decided we need to come up
with a final solution.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.158
As a Jew,
I don't love that term,

12:52.243 --> 12:54.410
but when in regards
to Kevin's sperm, it works.

12:54.496 --> 12:55.828
If, at the end of the season,

12:55.914 --> 12:57.413
I have a better record,
she's gonna get her tubes tied.

12:57.465 --> 12:59.298
<i>When,</i> at the end of the season,

12:59.384 --> 13:00.583
<i>I</i> have a better record,

13:00.635 --> 13:02.919
ol' Smoke Crotch over here
gets snipped.

13:03.004 --> 13:04.170
Well, I just want
to say thank you

13:04.255 --> 13:05.638
for not bringing any more

13:05.723 --> 13:07.306
of your genetically diminished
children into this world.

13:07.392 --> 13:08.558
Well, that's it.

13:08.593 --> 13:10.393
Gibiatti actually
served me papers.

13:10.428 --> 13:12.011
He's suing me
over these implants.

13:12.096 --> 13:13.429
You know, he may have a case.

13:13.481 --> 13:15.565
I did nothing to tamper
with those implants.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.267
Andre, you've been caught
taping your rivals' surgeries.

13:18.353 --> 13:19.769
Not funny. Shut up for a second.

13:19.854 --> 13:20.937
Yeah. Uh-huh?

13:21.022 --> 13:21.938
Right.

13:21.990 --> 13:23.523
No, I will not...

13:23.608 --> 13:25.024
Andre!
Tell us what's happening!

13:25.109 --> 13:26.192
I'm on the phone with my lawyer.
Please...

13:26.277 --> 13:27.577
Put it on speakerphone!

13:27.612 --> 13:28.744
We're lawyers, too!
Hold on, hold on.

13:28.780 --> 13:30.413
Yeah, yeah.

13:30.448 --> 13:31.747
Go again. What do you got?

13:31.783 --> 13:32.999
Look at the cut-off hoodie.

13:33.084 --> 13:34.784
The scowl?

13:34.836 --> 13:37.870
Andre is G-dash-D
Bill Belichick.

13:37.956 --> 13:38.704
I'm not giving up my phone.

13:38.790 --> 13:40.289
I'll destroy it for you.

13:40.375 --> 13:41.655
'Cause I have pictures on there.

13:41.709 --> 13:43.676
And it also has
all my slam lists.

13:43.761 --> 13:45.428
He look likes Belichick.

13:45.463 --> 13:46.963
But he's talking like Tom Brady.

13:47.048 --> 13:49.215
I think he looks more like the
courtroom sketches of Brady.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.184
Yeah, well, I'm not settling.

13:51.269 --> 13:52.468
What?

13:55.690 --> 13:56.772
What is going on out there?

13:56.808 --> 13:58.975
The neighbors having a party?

13:59.027 --> 14:01.394
Yeah...
Jews don't do the outdoors.

14:01.479 --> 14:02.812
Ah!

14:02.864 --> 14:04.230
Missed!

14:04.315 --> 14:06.156
What are you doing, Taco?
Who are these people?

14:06.201 --> 14:08.401
Started my own
bean bag toss league.

14:08.486 --> 14:09.819
Who needs to play at the bar

14:09.871 --> 14:11.487
when you can play
in a public park?

14:11.539 --> 14:12.822
This is our backyard.

14:12.907 --> 14:14.373
This is so much better.

14:14.459 --> 14:16.075
At the bar, there's always
a lineup for the bathroom.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.160
Here, you just go
wherever you want.

14:18.213 --> 14:19.574
No, you don't go
wherever you want.

14:19.581 --> 14:21.797
No, you don't just go
wherever you want, guys!

14:21.833 --> 14:23.049
Kevin, be a good host.
Let him finish.

14:23.134 --> 14:23.916
Who's next?

14:24.002 --> 14:25.585
Pete...
Oh! Uh...

14:25.670 --> 14:27.720
Wait, wait, wait.
Where did you get this?

14:27.805 --> 14:29.338
Oh, I've been practicing
with those all week.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.390
I got them from the bean bag
closet in your office.

14:31.426 --> 14:32.391
No, no, no, no, no no.

14:32.477 --> 14:33.593
These are breast implants.

14:33.678 --> 14:35.011
I don't care what you do
with your bean bags.

14:35.096 --> 14:37.146
Taco is the deflater!

14:37.181 --> 14:38.731
All right, everyone
in the hot tub!

14:38.816 --> 14:41.126
There hasn't been poop
in there in over a year.

14:42.118 --> 14:43.719
<i>Rabbi Shtotelman, Mrs.
Shtotelman,</i>

14:43.812 --> 14:45.478
thank you so much
for having me over

14:45.530 --> 14:46.529
for Shabbos.

14:46.615 --> 14:47.564
And Mrs. Shtotelman,

14:47.649 --> 14:48.815
what a beautiful meal it is.

14:48.900 --> 14:52.319
What a celebration
of delicious starches

14:52.404 --> 14:53.684
and earth-toned foods.

14:55.457 --> 14:56.406
Oh.

14:56.491 --> 14:57.874
Thank you, Sven, yeah.

14:57.960 --> 14:58.992
Don't mind him.
He's our Shabbos goy.

14:59.077 --> 15:00.910
Shabbos goy, huh?

15:00.996 --> 15:02.379
Yeah. You know,
the lights and the oven.

15:02.464 --> 15:04.164
Turns it off and on.
Of course.

15:04.249 --> 15:05.298
We can't use electricity,

15:05.334 --> 15:07.500
so we have a non-Jew present

15:07.552 --> 15:09.669
to take care of those
responsibilities for us.

15:09.755 --> 15:10.837
You have a Shabbos goy.

15:10.889 --> 15:12.589
Of course I have a Shabbos goy,

15:12.674 --> 15:14.891
but I don't actually use one

15:14.977 --> 15:16.176
unless it's an emergency.

15:16.228 --> 15:17.394
Oh, sweetheart.

15:17.479 --> 15:19.346
Can you pass the applesauce?

15:19.431 --> 15:21.231
Of course.

15:21.316 --> 15:22.766
My QB.

15:22.851 --> 15:23.984
I will get that for you, sir.
What?

15:24.019 --> 15:25.185
Oh.

15:25.270 --> 15:26.686
Oh, thanks, Sven.

15:26.772 --> 15:28.488
Absolutely, sir,
it is my pleasure.

15:28.523 --> 15:30.684
As it was, I'm sure, getting
that Hitler Youth haircut.

15:30.692 --> 15:33.026
You know, I'm going to be honest, Rabbi.
Hmm?

15:33.111 --> 15:35.829
I'm having a little bit
of Shabbos goy envy.

15:35.864 --> 15:38.114
If it's okay, Sven,
would you mind

15:38.200 --> 15:40.500
scrolling through my phone
and calling my Shabbos goy?

15:40.535 --> 15:41.534
Absolutely, sir.

15:41.620 --> 15:43.203
Uh, the name is Taco,

15:43.255 --> 15:46.039
but it will be under
an emoji of an eggplant.

15:46.091 --> 15:48.208
<i>Oh, yeah. Isn't this good?</i>

15:48.293 --> 15:50.377
It's... it's pretty good.

15:50.429 --> 15:51.711
Yeah.
I, uh...

15:51.763 --> 15:54.297
And what about this?

15:54.383 --> 15:56.016
Oh! Okay.
Oh, yes!

15:56.051 --> 15:57.017
You know what?

15:57.052 --> 15:58.518
You cannot always move

15:58.553 --> 16:00.553
all the action
to my side of the bed.

16:00.605 --> 16:01.771
That's encroachment.

16:01.857 --> 16:02.939
What about the
middle of the bed?

16:03.025 --> 16:04.107
Like, neutral zone?
Not your side,

16:04.192 --> 16:05.442
not my side...

16:05.527 --> 16:07.477
Yeah, but then we're both
playing on a sloppy field.

16:07.562 --> 16:09.029
Yeah, that's a good point.
It's like, uh...

16:09.064 --> 16:10.563
Couch?
Ah...

16:10.615 --> 16:11.981
I feel like couch is
harder to clean than

16:12.067 --> 16:13.233
even sheets, you
know what I mean?

16:13.318 --> 16:14.401
This is a tough one.
Mm-hmm.

16:15.737 --> 16:16.820
I got it.

16:16.905 --> 16:19.072
Oh...
Oh, yeah...

16:19.157 --> 16:20.373
The floor!

16:20.409 --> 16:21.741
The answer to all
of our problems.

16:21.793 --> 16:23.376
Right?
You're a genius.

16:23.412 --> 16:24.794
You're like a sexy
Einstein, man.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.413
You know how to get me going.

16:26.498 --> 16:27.747
Uh, who is it?

16:27.833 --> 16:29.249
It's Francis Gibiatti!

16:29.334 --> 16:30.834
Oh, Frank "The Body."

16:30.919 --> 16:32.502
Uh, it's open!
It's open?

16:32.587 --> 16:33.920
Well, I mean, technically,
it's broken, but...

16:33.972 --> 16:35.422
I don't like to announce it.

16:35.507 --> 16:36.973
Hey!

16:37.059 --> 16:38.339
You're in a lot
of trouble, dawg.

16:40.262 --> 16:41.177
Speak English?

16:41.263 --> 16:42.429
Yeah.

16:42.514 --> 16:43.897
Hard pass.

16:43.932 --> 16:46.316
Is Andre using breast
implants to play Cornhole?

16:46.401 --> 16:47.150
Yeah.

16:47.235 --> 16:48.101
That dude is using

16:48.186 --> 16:49.436
underinflated titties.

16:49.521 --> 16:51.988
Okay? And you're gonna testify
on my behalf

16:52.074 --> 16:54.774
against your scumbag friend
Nowzick. Fact!

16:54.860 --> 16:56.359
You are gonna stand
on that bench

16:56.445 --> 16:57.577
and point at your
friend and say,

16:57.612 --> 16:58.661
"Your Honor,
he did it."

16:58.747 --> 17:00.330
Then Andre is going to spend

17:00.415 --> 17:03.032
the next ten to 15 years...

17:03.118 --> 17:04.617
with a lot of dicks in his butt.

17:04.669 --> 17:07.704
That guy is going to be
Old Country Buffet in jail.

17:07.789 --> 17:10.339
He's gonna have a sneeze guard
around his asshole.

17:10.425 --> 17:12.509
I don't understand why
you need me to testify.

17:12.594 --> 17:14.761
Dude, come on, man.
I need you on this one, Pete.

17:14.796 --> 17:16.762
You know, I'm not so sure
I want to do that, honestly.

17:16.798 --> 17:17.558
You're gonna do it!

17:17.632 --> 17:19.549
<i>Da!</i>

17:19.634 --> 17:20.633
Whoa...
Oh!

17:20.685 --> 17:22.185
My angel!

17:22.270 --> 17:23.803
If she broke her back,

17:23.855 --> 17:25.438
I swear to God
I will leave her here.

17:29.060 --> 17:30.860
Did you two have sex
on the floor?

17:30.946 --> 17:32.395
We had sex in the bed, too.

17:32.481 --> 17:33.641
Yeah, okay, well, guess what.

17:33.648 --> 17:35.398
Now you're getting sued, too.

17:35.484 --> 17:37.117
I don't really own that much.

17:37.152 --> 17:38.432
And besides,
that was mostly her.

17:38.487 --> 17:40.487
Excuse me?

17:40.572 --> 17:42.489
Oh, please, buddy.
I was not <i> that</i> excited.

17:42.541 --> 17:43.656
Oh, are you kidding me?

17:43.742 --> 17:44.942
You were juicin' it up, sister.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.400
So now we're back
to the juice thing?

17:46.411 --> 17:47.744
Well, we need a better word.
We haven't found it yet.

17:47.829 --> 17:49.162
Yeah, it's called
"brine."

17:49.214 --> 17:49.963
Ew.
Yeah.

17:49.998 --> 17:50.914
Because it's salty

17:50.999 --> 17:52.298
and it tenderizes meat.

17:52.334 --> 17:54.334
And you are so lucky
that it's Shabbos.

17:54.386 --> 17:56.719
Otherwise, my lawyer
would be here right now,

17:56.805 --> 17:58.004
suing your ass...

17:58.056 --> 17:59.339
Whoa!

18:00.892 --> 18:01.841
We had sex twice.

18:01.910 --> 18:03.320
Yeah.

18:04.175 --> 18:07.178
So my great-grandfather,
he put in these perforations,

18:07.298 --> 18:09.215
and then that is what
was brought back here

18:09.250 --> 18:11.570
- and that is why you know the matzo as...
- Aloha!

18:11.690 --> 18:13.386
I am the Shabbos guy.

18:13.421 --> 18:14.670
Shabbos goy, Taco.

18:14.756 --> 18:16.088
Aloha.

18:16.174 --> 18:17.390
Whoo! Aloha.

18:17.425 --> 18:18.391
Love the tuque, dude.

18:18.426 --> 18:19.925
Whoo!

18:19.977 --> 18:21.477
What a handsome
young Shabbos goy.

18:21.562 --> 18:22.978
All right.

18:23.064 --> 18:25.097
How can I help you Jews out?

18:25.149 --> 18:26.766
Well, Sven is not Jewish,

18:26.818 --> 18:28.601
but, Sven, you can start
by giving Taco my phone.

18:28.686 --> 18:30.352
As you wish, sir.

18:30.438 --> 18:31.737
Actually, we could use some help

18:31.773 --> 18:33.053
with the serving platters, Taco.

18:33.074 --> 18:34.073
Oh.

18:34.108 --> 18:35.658
Well, I was recently surfing

18:35.743 --> 18:37.326
on the Big Island
of the Promised Land

18:37.412 --> 18:38.944
and I learned how to make poi.

18:38.996 --> 18:40.946
Oh, that sounds exciting.

18:41.032 --> 18:42.498
Mm-hmm.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.116
Sven, dishes.
Right away, ma'am.

18:44.202 --> 18:45.835
I will be helping out
with dessert...

18:45.920 --> 18:49.121
in the kitchen.

18:49.207 --> 18:51.874
Hmm.

18:51.959 --> 18:54.376
Rabbi, if you could
excuse me for a moment,

18:54.462 --> 18:57.179
one of my Torah studies scholars
was recently injured

18:57.265 --> 19:00.716
and I need to replace him
on my... team.

19:00.802 --> 19:02.384
Excuse me for a moment.

19:02.470 --> 19:04.053
What can I do for you, Ruspin?

19:04.138 --> 19:05.471
Just get on the waiver wire

19:05.556 --> 19:06.605
and find me a new quarterback.

19:06.641 --> 19:08.140
Let's do this.

19:08.192 --> 19:09.308
Uh... Nick Toon.

19:09.360 --> 19:10.943
He's a wide receiver, Taco.

19:10.978 --> 19:12.728
Dan Carpenter.
He's a kicker.

19:12.814 --> 19:13.974
Are you having another stroke?

19:13.981 --> 19:15.030
I'm about to.

19:15.116 --> 19:17.650
"DraftKings:
free games, huge prizes."

19:17.702 --> 19:18.984
Quit playing around, you idiot.

19:19.036 --> 19:20.903
This is a very
complicated religion.

19:20.988 --> 19:22.822
If you're looking
for a Torah studies scholar,

19:22.907 --> 19:24.206
Benjamin Schlomovitz.

19:24.292 --> 19:25.324
He's the best.

19:25.376 --> 19:26.992
Hmm, I'm looking
at your team, Ruxin,

19:27.078 --> 19:28.828
and I'm not seeing
a Schlomovitz.

19:28.913 --> 19:31.497
But I am seeing a LeSean McCoy.

19:31.549 --> 19:32.915
LeSean McCoy?

19:33.000 --> 19:36.502
LeSean McCoy, actually, uh,
was a very important member

19:36.587 --> 19:38.220
of the Philadelphia
Jewish community

19:38.306 --> 19:39.889
and, then, for some reason,
they let him go,

19:39.974 --> 19:43.476
and now he's part of
the Buffalo Jewish community.

19:43.511 --> 19:45.177
Uh, it's a very important
congregation

19:45.229 --> 19:47.146
led by a new rabbi there,

19:47.181 --> 19:49.231
Rex Ryanstein, who loves feet.

19:49.317 --> 19:51.650
Of Torah study.

19:51.686 --> 19:53.269
McCoy?
Yeah.

19:53.354 --> 19:55.020
That sounds Gentile.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.155
It sounds very Gentile to me.

19:56.190 --> 19:57.323
We should drop him.

19:57.358 --> 19:58.774
Drop him.
No, don't drop him.

19:58.860 --> 20:00.359
Drop him.
Don't drop him, Taco.

20:00.411 --> 20:02.161
We want only Jews on this team.

20:02.196 --> 20:03.445
Dropping him.
No, Taco!

20:03.531 --> 20:04.580
Just go to the kitchen.

20:04.665 --> 20:05.865
Jesus Christ.
Superstar.

20:05.950 --> 20:07.700
Play probably written by a Jew.

20:07.752 --> 20:09.752
Yes, master.

20:09.837 --> 20:10.536
What are you doing
on your phone?

20:10.588 --> 20:11.954
I am fixing

20:12.039 --> 20:13.589
my fantasy football lineup.

20:13.674 --> 20:15.541
That is not allowed
on the Sabbath.

20:15.626 --> 20:17.209
If fantasy football
had been around

20:17.261 --> 20:18.342
when the Torah was written,

20:18.346 --> 20:19.428
it would have been allowed.

20:19.514 --> 20:21.263
Cain and Abel would have
killed each other

20:21.349 --> 20:23.265
on the virtual gridiron.

20:23.351 --> 20:26.802
Abraham and Isaac would've been
on a father-son team together.

20:26.888 --> 20:28.470
I mean, think of
the possibilities

20:28.556 --> 20:30.055
of amazing team names.

20:30.107 --> 20:31.891
"Reggie and the Burning Bush"

20:31.943 --> 20:33.642
would've worked
for biblical reasons

20:33.728 --> 20:36.228
but also because he was dating
Kim Kardashian

20:36.280 --> 20:38.898
and it would have been
an amazing STD joke.

20:38.983 --> 20:41.534
You are a shame to your people
and to your religion.

20:41.569 --> 20:42.701
Fantasy football

20:42.737 --> 20:44.286
is my religion.

20:44.372 --> 20:45.487
Nothing brings me

20:45.573 --> 20:47.623
greater spiritual enlightenment

20:47.708 --> 20:50.626
than picturing me taking
my big, fat donger

20:50.711 --> 20:52.328
that is my team

20:52.413 --> 20:55.047
and slapping it
in my friends' face,

20:55.082 --> 20:58.918
dropping loads on them
like manna from heaven.

20:58.970 --> 21:01.170
Sunday is my Sabbath.

21:01.255 --> 21:03.472
And Mondays and Thursdays

21:03.558 --> 21:06.141
and Saturdays in December, baby.

21:06.227 --> 21:07.927
Get the hell out of my house!

21:07.979 --> 21:10.479
Get the hell out of my house!

21:10.565 --> 21:12.431
Oh... oh...
Taco!

21:12.483 --> 21:13.816
What the hell are you doing?

21:13.901 --> 21:15.818
Well, you can't.
It's the Sabbath.

21:15.903 --> 21:17.603
I'm gonna kill you!

21:17.655 --> 21:18.904
Aloha...

21:18.940 --> 21:21.073
Aloha!

21:21.108 --> 21:22.241
Sven, you got a wet spot
over here.

21:22.276 --> 21:23.609
Oopsie.
