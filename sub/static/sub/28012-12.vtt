WEBVTT

00:03.904 --> 00:06.716
- Are you sure you want to poke the bear?
- I want to rip his heart out.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.743
All-new episodes
of Proven Innocent Fridays.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.545
And check out
our other hit shows...

00:11.579 --> 00:14.315
The Resident, 9-1-1, and Empire.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.916
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.852
Previously on Proven Innocent...

00:18.886 --> 00:20.088
You make me a better person.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.755
I think that I might
even be able to be

00:21.789 --> 00:23.124
a good example for Nathan.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.993
You really think
that Rosemary joined a cult?

00:26.026 --> 00:27.461
- Who else is there?
- Sarah Tawney.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.663
We're trying to figure out
what the "R" stood for.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.965
I'm guessing
your cult leader, Ravi?

00:31.999 --> 00:33.577
If he can give you some
evidence that might help

00:33.601 --> 00:35.136
reopen Rosemary's murder case...

00:35.169 --> 00:37.471
you could find yourself
sitting second chair

00:37.505 --> 00:39.207
in the biggest trial
of the year.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.041
Madeline chased after Rosemary.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.810
She was carrying that lantern.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.313
Madeline Scott, you are
under arrest for the murder

00:45.346 --> 00:46.680
of Rosemary Lynch.

00:51.485 --> 00:52.986
Good morning.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.189
Yesterday my office
executed an arrest warrant

00:55.223 --> 00:57.658
for Madeline Scott
for the murder

00:57.691 --> 01:00.060
of 17-year-old Rosemary Lynch.

01:00.094 --> 01:03.231
Ten years ago, her conviction
was regrettably vacated,

01:03.264 --> 01:04.831
but this office...

01:04.864 --> 01:08.469
My office... has always been
convinced of her guilt.

01:11.038 --> 01:15.176
Right now, Madeline Scott
is in prison, awaiting bail.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.411
As a prosecutor,
it's my job to produce

01:17.445 --> 01:21.549
credible evidence of guilt
beyond any reasonable doubt.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.251
I promise you today,

01:23.284 --> 01:24.652
I will do that.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.496
- What the hell's going on in here?
- Contraband search.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.964
You can rip my room apart
all you want,

01:27.988 --> 01:29.299
but you can't take my personal
belongings, okay?

01:29.323 --> 01:33.093
I'm entitled
papers, pens and my case files.

01:33.127 --> 01:37.398
Because unlike our original
trial, we are now 100% sure

01:37.431 --> 01:40.401
we have the weapon
Madeline Scott used

01:40.434 --> 01:42.436
to murder Rosemary Lynch.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.181
- Please, look... you need to give those back.
- Hey.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.507
You're not going nowhere,
so bitch and moan

01:46.540 --> 01:48.876
to someone who cares.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.745
Justice will finally be served.

01:51.779 --> 01:56.284
The Lynch family
will finally have closure,

01:56.317 --> 01:59.320
because the monster
who murdered their loved one

01:59.353 --> 02:01.322
will spend the rest of her life

02:01.355 --> 02:03.191
behind bars.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:22.676 --> 02:25.646
First off, I want to
thank all the thousands

02:25.679 --> 02:27.481
of Madeline Scott supporters

02:27.515 --> 02:29.717
who have phoned and e-mailed

02:29.750 --> 02:31.151
with their good wishes

02:31.185 --> 02:34.555
and even started
a GoFundMe campaign.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.558
Madeline's bond hearing is set,
so she will be out

02:37.591 --> 02:40.894
and working on her defense
against these baseless charges.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.731
With your help, she will
finally prove her innocence

02:43.764 --> 02:45.966
once and for all.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.210
And speaking of innocence,

02:56.244 --> 02:59.347
the fight against injustice
never stops.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.182
Tomorrow we fight
for Hector Costa,

03:02.216 --> 03:04.184
a 23-year-old Dreamer

03:04.218 --> 03:06.254
whose mother brought him here.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.456
They fled El Salvador
after his father

03:08.489 --> 03:11.825
was hacked to death by MS-13.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.061
After being wrongfully
convicted of murdering

03:14.094 --> 03:15.996
his favorite
high school teacher,

03:16.029 --> 03:19.333
Hector has spent
the last five years in prison.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.535
Looking good, Hector.
How you feeling?

03:21.569 --> 03:24.272
Nervous. But, you know, okay.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.774
- Ready for this to be over.
- I bet.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.742
I spoke to your family.

03:28.776 --> 03:32.079
They all send their prayers,
can't wait to bring you home.

03:32.112 --> 03:35.283
You know, none of this makes
sense, Mr. Boudreau.

03:35.316 --> 03:38.151
Why would I want
to hurt Mrs. Brennan?

03:38.185 --> 03:40.588
She helped me get good grades.
I was going to college.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.022
I know.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.258
Why would anybody
want to hurt her?

03:44.292 --> 03:45.959
Then the police came
and arrested me.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.796
Hey, hey, don't worry.
Their case is weak,

03:48.829 --> 03:50.264
and we've got everything we need

03:50.298 --> 03:51.732
to overturn
the conviction, Hector.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.402
I hope so.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.904
Did Mom bring the suit? She was
supposed to give it to you.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.939
No, she brought it,
but you can't wear it today.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.609
It's a hearing,
and you're still convicted

04:01.642 --> 04:04.578
in the eyes of Judge Gleason.
It's not fair, but...

04:04.612 --> 04:07.247
How am I supposed to convince
the judge I didn't do this if...

04:07.281 --> 04:08.782
all she sees is a convict?

04:08.816 --> 04:11.419
It's not your job to convince
the judge, it's mine.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.854
But what you can do

04:13.887 --> 04:16.023
is sit up straight,
keep your head up,

04:16.055 --> 04:18.492
and look the judge in the eye...

04:18.526 --> 04:21.962
and let her know there's more
to you than just clothes.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.665
Much more, all right?

04:27.401 --> 04:30.404
Dr. Lovatt, according
to the state, Hector Costa

04:30.438 --> 04:33.073
killed Barbara Brennan
in a burglary gone wrong.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.910
The only physical evidence
linking Hector to the burglary

04:36.944 --> 04:39.447
was Mrs. Brennan's
stolen laptop,

04:39.480 --> 04:41.349
which was found
in his possession.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.216
Based on the computer's
Internet history,

04:43.250 --> 04:45.128
he'd been using the device
at his family's apartment

04:45.152 --> 04:47.455
for several weeks
prior to the murder.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.566
And that supports Hector's
contention that Mrs. Brennan

04:49.590 --> 04:51.825
had given him
her old laptop as a gift

04:51.859 --> 04:54.462
to reward his hard work
in her tutoring classes.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.464
Objection, Your Honor.
Lack of foundation.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.632
The computer's hard drive
had been deleted.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.143
There's no way
this witness has any...

05:00.167 --> 05:02.936
You'll get your chance
to cross in a moment, Counsel.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.573
- Continue, Mr. Boudreau.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.075
Now, given that police
accidentally erased

05:08.108 --> 05:10.678
the computer's hard drive,
how can you be sure.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.080
Mrs. Brennan's laptop
was in Hector's possession

05:13.113 --> 05:15.383
- weeks before the burglary?
- Hector set the computer

05:15.416 --> 05:17.751
to send and receive
text messages.

05:17.785 --> 05:20.087
When the computer connected
to the apartment's Wi-Fi,

05:20.120 --> 05:22.289
it operated like
an additional cell phone.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.492
The family's cell phone records
supported that.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.403
If anyone cared about that young
man, they'd have found it.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.628
Objection, Your Honor.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.631
Dr. Lovatt is not an expert
in police investigation.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.965
Sustained.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.734
You people are disgraceful.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.369
You should all be ashamed
of yourselves.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.070
Steve, let me handle this.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.673
This hearing is making
a mockery of my wife's death!

05:39.707 --> 05:42.376
Mr. Brennan,
I understand your anguish,

05:42.410 --> 05:44.244
but if you want to remain
in my courtroom,

05:44.277 --> 05:46.213
you'll compose yourself.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.121
You got to get me out of here.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.524
I'm starting to feel
really useless.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.161
- I should have seen this coming.
- How?

06:01.194 --> 06:03.897
After 16 years,
Bellows finds a murder weapon?

06:03.931 --> 06:05.966
No one could predict that.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.902
I know, I just feel
like I let you down.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.438
Well, you didn't.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.973
I saw his press conference.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.374
It's all just empty bluster.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.810
I actually think the whole thing
is just a campaign stunt.

06:16.844 --> 06:20.147
Why do you think he called Levi
a person of interest?

06:20.180 --> 06:21.949
You sure he's not in lockup?

06:21.982 --> 06:24.885
I went by County. C.O. checked,
they don't have him.

06:24.918 --> 06:28.355
Maybe he freaked and bolted when
he found out I got arrested?

06:40.300 --> 06:42.069
Levi?

06:42.102 --> 06:43.413
You know,
you should really invest

06:43.437 --> 06:45.806
in a more expensive lock, buddy.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.169
Where the hell are you, Levi?

07:17.705 --> 07:19.473
Talk to me about the office.

07:19.507 --> 07:22.209
What's, what's going on
with our cases? Where are we?

07:22.242 --> 07:24.044
We're gonna get
a continuance on most.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.480
The judges understand
the circumstances.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.792
- Most judges?
- I have to attend the Hector Costa hearing.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.151
- We're ready?
- More than ready.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.853
It's Judge Gleason, right?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.254
You don't know her like I do.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.223
She's fair-minded,
but she can have her moods,

07:36.256 --> 07:38.325
- so, you know, if you...
- Hey... hey.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.527
I got this.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.631
The only case you need
to worry about is yours.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.400
Now, the outcome's gonna be
very different this time.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.537
No jury's gonna convict you
once they hear

07:49.570 --> 07:51.805
that the victim was involved
in a sex cult

07:51.839 --> 07:53.974
that was led by a serial rapist
and a pedophile.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.376
An as-yet-identified
serial rapist.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.712
We're gonna need
a lot more than the name Ravi

07:58.746 --> 08:00.914
if we're gonna name him
as an alternative suspect.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.551
- We'll ID him and then we'll find him.
- Okay,

08:03.584 --> 08:05.529
and we're gonna need one of
the girls involved to testify,

08:05.553 --> 08:08.989
- or the...
- Maddie, we're all over it.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.391
Why don't you go back
and get some rest?

08:11.424 --> 08:13.226
I know you.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.538
You're gonna want
to hit the ground running

08:14.562 --> 08:16.029
when you get
out of here tomorrow.

08:18.532 --> 08:21.001
So you were the last one
to speak to Levi.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.469
Did he tell you
where he was going?

08:22.502 --> 08:23.837
No. I haven't heard from him.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.906
I-I thought he got
arrested, too.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.776
No, he's missing.
What did you two talk about?

08:28.809 --> 08:31.111
We were talking about Rosemary.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.280
He was trying to figure out
if this group of girls

08:33.313 --> 08:35.258
from high school had anything
to do with her death.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.051
And by "group of girls,"
you mean the cult?

08:39.452 --> 08:42.722
Levi told Madeline all about
what was happening to you girls.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.292
It was Heather
and some guy named Ravi.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.861
What did you tell Levi?

08:49.462 --> 08:51.565
We've tracked down
more than 20 girls

08:51.599 --> 08:53.967
that this creep abused, and
you're the only one whose life

08:54.001 --> 08:56.303
wasn't completely wrecked
by the trauma.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.338
I have tomorrow off.

08:59.973 --> 09:03.143
Call me and I will meet you
at Sparrow Ridge.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.045
I'll tell you what I know.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.780
Thank you.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.189
Mr. Granados, the morning
Mrs. Brennan was killed,

09:16.223 --> 09:17.701
you were working
at a neighbor's house

09:17.725 --> 09:19.660
across the street, correct?

09:19.693 --> 09:21.494
I was working, yes. I was there.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.664
Did you see Hector Costa
that morning?

09:23.697 --> 09:25.933
Sí... Yes.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.543
The prosecution alleges
that Hector killed.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.569
Mrs. Brennan at 400 a.m.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.305
M and M results determine
that as the time of death.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.142
- Is that when you saw Hector arrive at the house?
- No.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.844
At 400 a.m. I am sleeping.

09:36.877 --> 09:40.347
I arrived at 700, and I see
the boy arrive then, too.

09:40.380 --> 09:44.384
You saw Hector arrive at
the Brennan house at 700 a.m.?

09:44.417 --> 09:47.187
Yes. Not 400 a.m.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.422
No way.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.258
Thank you.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.760
The facts don't add up here.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.696
There are timeline problems,
motive issues.

09:55.729 --> 09:58.231
If the State has overwhelming
evidence of Mr. Costa's guilt,

09:58.265 --> 10:00.267
it should be no problem
to try him again

10:00.300 --> 10:01.902
and win another conviction.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.171
Petitioner's motion
for a new trial is granted.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.173
No. Don't do this.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.717
- He's-he's a murderer!
- Your Honor, we request

10:07.741 --> 10:09.710
a reasonable bond
while awaiting trial.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.112
Agreed.
Bond is set for $100,000.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.385
This is just the beginning,
Mrs. Costa.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.253
We'll prove Hector's innocence
at a new trial.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.454
Immigration. Hector Costa,

10:21.488 --> 10:23.223
you're being detained
pending removal.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.392
Where? El Salvador, ma'am.
Listen, there's no need

10:25.425 --> 10:26.569
- to do that.
- Hey, step aside.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.729
I haven't been there
since I was a baby, man.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.964
What are you doing? You're
treating him like a criminal.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.734
- Sir...
- Hey, listen, stay calm, Hector.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.737
- We'll straighten this out. Don't worry.
- I need you to stay back.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.406
I need you to settle down.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.741
You did this.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.209
Me? What are you talking about?

10:42.242 --> 10:44.745
You lost the hearing
and then you contacted ICE.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.246
I didn't call anyone.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.281
This is the first
I'm hearing about this.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.650
Mr. Boudreau, please.

10:50.684 --> 10:53.754
MS-13 will kill him
in El Salvador.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.790
I won't let them deport him,
and that's a promise.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.734
Deportation order number 3217,

11:06.767 --> 11:09.502
make your appearance.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.777
Everybody settle down.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.345
We'll call you when we need you.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.818
Leonardo Gonzalez,

11:24.852 --> 11:27.220
do you understand
this proceeding?

11:29.156 --> 11:30.767
Leonardo Gonzalez was separated
from his parents.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.993
They're in process to go back
to Guatemala.

11:33.026 --> 11:37.230
Leonardo, have you talked
to an immigration attorney?

11:45.172 --> 11:46.139
Settle down, guys.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.640
Ezekiel Boudreau,

11:47.674 --> 11:49.709
substituting in
for petitioner's counsel.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.146
Aren't you here
on another matter, Mr. Boudreau?

11:53.180 --> 11:54.481
I am, Your Honor,

11:54.514 --> 11:56.474
but I'm stepping in
to add a dose of common sense.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.652
What are we asking
a four-year-old

11:59.686 --> 12:01.488
if he has an attorney,
or if he understands

12:01.521 --> 12:02.721
what's going on in this place?

12:04.024 --> 12:07.160
We move to reunite
the petitioner with his parents.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.129
That's inconsistent with policy.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.630
That policy is nonsense,
Your Honor.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.667
Where are his parents
right now, Ms. Riley?

12:14.701 --> 12:16.436
We're not sure at this time.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.871
Well, find out.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.009
To the next attorney general.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.144
Well... just a second,

12:24.177 --> 12:25.345
let's not get carried away,

12:25.378 --> 12:27.180
we still got a lot
of work to do.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.616
Although... And we have
a murder trial to win,

12:29.649 --> 12:32.319
which I'm feeling
pretty good about.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.686
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.722
Thank you. Thank you all.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.926
Can I talk to you for a moment?

12:38.959 --> 12:42.029
Yes, of course.
Um, everybody, I'm afraid, um...

12:42.062 --> 12:43.931
we need the room.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.801
Thanks for this, and, um,
get back to work.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.843
I'm a little concerned about my
staged intimacy with Levi Scott.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.610
Well, your investigation...

12:57.644 --> 13:00.547
was tangential at best
to this case.

13:00.580 --> 13:04.117
But what you did is
a clear ethics violation.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.618
And if you put Levi
on the stand,

13:05.652 --> 13:06.619
the defense will discover
everything.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.922
- They won't.
- How could they not?

13:08.956 --> 13:10.057
I'm sitting second chair.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.600
He's gonna recognize me
in the courtroom.

13:11.624 --> 13:15.528
About that...
I can't make you second chair.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.065
In fact, I have to let you go.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.732
What?

13:19.766 --> 13:21.577
I'm trying to protect you,
Isabel, and the case.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.570
What you did was helpful
to our efforts,

13:23.603 --> 13:25.605
but it would certainly
cause a problem now.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.240
With you gone,
all hands are clean.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.910
You wanted me to do this.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.345
I don't recall every detail
of our conversation,

13:32.379 --> 13:34.781
but I think it's best
for both of us

13:34.814 --> 13:36.614
if we terminate
our professional relationship.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.586
I will call you soon.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.621
Security will help you
clean out your office.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.756
What makes you think
I'm not just gonna

13:43.790 --> 13:45.158
tell the defense
about everything

13:45.192 --> 13:46.326
and destroy your case?

13:46.359 --> 13:48.828
Because if you do that,
you'll be disbarred.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.463
I will claim no knowledge
of your actions

13:50.497 --> 13:53.000
and leave you to the pathetic
prospects of waitressing

13:53.033 --> 13:55.068
and watching reality TV.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.436
How could you?

13:56.469 --> 13:58.438
Isabel, I pulled you
from obscurity

13:58.471 --> 13:59.606
when you were a child.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.274
I can put you right back in.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.675
Or...

14:02.709 --> 14:05.512
you can go away quietly now,
for a year, and find yourself

14:05.545 --> 14:08.615
in a job
at the attorney general's office

14:08.648 --> 14:10.850
after things have cooled down.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.886
Be smart, Isabel.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.223
It's how you got here.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.795
I have co-counsel
at this hearing, Your Honor.

14:22.829 --> 14:25.032
I'm Gerald Warren,
assistant state's attorney

14:25.065 --> 14:26.466
for Cook County, lead prosecutor

14:26.499 --> 14:28.768
in The State of Illinois
v. Hector Costa.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.147
You sure you're standing at the
right table, Mr. Prosecutor?

14:31.171 --> 14:32.139
Yes, Your Honor.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.716
For the purposes
of today's proceedings,

14:33.740 --> 14:36.143
I will be appearing on behalf
of petitioner.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.611
We both want the petitioner
to stay here and stand trial.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.481
Petitioner's on his way back
to El Salvador, Mr. Warren.

14:41.514 --> 14:42.715
Why not take the easy win?

14:42.749 --> 14:44.517
Well, many in my shoes have,
Your Honor.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.353
In fact, MS-13 as an entity

14:46.386 --> 14:47.887
was created
by California prosecutors

14:47.921 --> 14:50.257
who chose to deport
instead of try

14:50.290 --> 14:52.159
and punish violent aliens.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.995
I have no interest
in continuing this

14:55.028 --> 14:57.497
naive and ignoble tradition.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.275
Mr. Boudreau, your client would
rather face a murder trial

14:59.299 --> 15:00.833
than hop a free plane ride home?

15:00.867 --> 15:02.669
America is Mr. Costa's home,
Your Honor.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.737
It has been since he was
three years old.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.639
He was living here
lawfully as a Dreamer

15:06.673 --> 15:08.675
until he was wrongfully accused
of this crime.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.543
Mr. Costa views this trial
as an opportunity

15:10.577 --> 15:12.012
to prove his innocence.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.047
At which time we will return
to your courtroom

15:14.081 --> 15:16.149
and ask you to reinstate
his docket status.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.684
Ms. Riley, any objections?

15:17.717 --> 15:20.020
It is always in the interest
of public safety

15:20.053 --> 15:23.190
to remove violent criminals
as quickly as possible.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.958
And where is petitioner now?

15:24.992 --> 15:26.859
Cook County
Correctional Facility.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.629
And we are no longer seeking
release on bond, Your Honor.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.532
That pretty much undercuts
your public safety argument,

15:32.565 --> 15:33.633
Ms. Riley.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.669
Petitioner's stay of removal
is hereby granted.

15:36.703 --> 15:40.207
- Game on.
- See you in court.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.389
How's my girl?

15:59.492 --> 16:01.995
Little freaked out, actually.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.299
How's everyone at the office?

16:06.333 --> 16:08.301
The same.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.737
No one's sleeping or eating.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.239
We're all on edge.

16:12.272 --> 16:15.375
But we are using that fear
to work that much harder.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.077
We've gone over the entire case,

16:17.110 --> 16:19.979
and we're waiting for
police investigation reports.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.815
A lot of people
love you, Maddie.

16:22.849 --> 16:25.385
Tell them not to worry.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.487
Tell them I'm making bail,
and...

16:27.520 --> 16:28.921
then we're gonna win this.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.702
- Wren, what if...
- No.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.305
We're not going there.
You know as well as I do,

16:45.338 --> 16:48.275
negative thoughts
cripple people in here.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.277
You are not calling this place
home again.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.280
I won't let you.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.849
Even if I have to Shawshank
you out of here.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.958
Any sign of Levi?

17:05.992 --> 17:08.728
Not yet, but we'll keep looking
until we find him.

17:08.761 --> 17:09.762
Promise.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.742
Don't let him get to you.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.315
The People request
there be no bond in this case.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.183
Defendant is an officer
of the court

17:30.217 --> 17:31.984
and a member of the Illinois Bar

17:32.018 --> 17:33.720
with an extensive professional
and personal

17:33.753 --> 17:35.288
connection to the community.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.090
Mr. Bellows, I take it
you wouldn't be asking

17:37.124 --> 17:40.327
for a no-bond ruling
without significant cause?

17:40.360 --> 17:41.904
As a lawyer, Ms. Scott
is uniquely aware

17:41.928 --> 17:45.064
that she faces
the overwhelming probability

17:45.098 --> 17:46.333
that she will be convicted

17:46.366 --> 17:49.136
and spend the rest
of her natural life in prison.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.470
Mr. Boudreau, that likelihood

17:50.503 --> 17:53.673
of conviction is a key factor
in determining flight risk.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.409
Is there anything you can add
to convince this court

17:56.443 --> 17:58.778
that Ms. Scott
may not face conviction?

18:03.082 --> 18:06.018
At trial, we will not only prove
Ms. Scott's innocence

18:06.052 --> 18:07.387
but also, for the first time,

18:07.420 --> 18:09.489
identify the true killer
or Rosemary Lynch.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.267
In fact, we have identified
alternative suspects,

18:11.291 --> 18:14.994
including the state's star
witness, Heather Dupinski,

18:15.027 --> 18:16.929
now Heather Husband,
and the deranged leader

18:16.963 --> 18:19.065
of a sex cult

18:19.098 --> 18:21.601
that preyed on underage
teenage girls.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.670
Defense counsel's firm

18:23.703 --> 18:25.772
has earned its name
by propagating

18:25.805 --> 18:28.841
ungrounded salacious allegations
that do not belong

18:28.875 --> 18:30.177
in a courtroom.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.346
Well, that's funny,
considering the entire re-arrest

18:33.380 --> 18:34.547
of my client is nothing more

18:34.581 --> 18:36.383
than a campaign-motivated
publicity stunt.

18:36.416 --> 18:39.219
Enough. Counsel approach.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.595
Since you both have displayed
such a fair-minded

18:48.628 --> 18:51.398
and unprejudiced spirit,
I've decided

18:51.431 --> 18:53.533
to split the difference
and give you one each.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.368
Counselor, you'll get your bond.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.246
- Yes, Your Honor, thank you.
- On the other hand,

18:57.270 --> 19:01.241
I share Mr. Bellows' concerns
about these rather sensational

19:01.274 --> 19:02.909
alternative suspects
you plan to present.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.577
At trial we will back
our allegations

19:04.611 --> 19:06.755
with concrete evidence
and firsthand witness testimony.

19:06.779 --> 19:10.217
No. You'll present your evidence
and your witnesses to me

19:10.250 --> 19:11.260
in a pre-trial hearing away

19:11.284 --> 19:13.320
from the prying eyes
of the press.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.455
If you have the goods,
you can proceed

19:15.488 --> 19:16.599
with your stated trial strategy.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.358
I'll need time to prepare
a presentation.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.435
Three weeks would be ideal...

19:19.459 --> 19:21.928
You'll have three days,
Counselor.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.364
Now both of you, go.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.601
What?

19:28.635 --> 19:30.169
Nothing.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.839
We just have three days
to prove our case.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.174
Bond is set for $500,000.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.576
We're done for the day.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.378
Good evening.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.852
When I asked you to testify,

19:45.885 --> 19:48.120
why didn't you tell me
about this cult?

19:48.154 --> 19:51.758
"Cult" is a derogatory word
used by narrow-minded people

19:51.791 --> 19:53.231
who are not open
to the enlightenment

19:53.260 --> 19:54.727
that shines within others.

19:55.795 --> 19:56.929
Okay.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.466
If this cult...
And that's what it was, a cult...

19:59.499 --> 20:00.800
If this cult existed,

20:00.833 --> 20:02.969
then they have
a viable narrative

20:03.002 --> 20:04.237
for an alternative suspect.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.706
A few girls hanging out
and taking drugs isn't a cult.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.140
It's just high school.

20:08.174 --> 20:11.844
There was an older man
hanging around, too.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.646
Correct?

20:13.680 --> 20:17.049
Was he having sex
with the girls?

20:18.785 --> 20:19.952
Listen to me, Heather.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.988
The defense is gonna paint you
as the number two

20:22.021 --> 20:24.324
of this cult, a sex recruiter
for this deranged leader.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.725
If they implicate the leader,

20:25.758 --> 20:27.694
they will implicate you.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.998
Ravi left town

20:32.031 --> 20:34.334
before the night
Rosemary was murdered.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.902
Now you're getting it.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.004
I hadn't seen him in weeks.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.607
He was just some random loser

20:40.640 --> 20:43.876
trying to scam
high school girls.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.012
He had nothing to do
with her death.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.080
None of us did.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.950
If you blame this
on a group of girls hanging out,

20:50.983 --> 20:53.353
that means that literally
any girl in America

20:53.386 --> 20:55.355
could have killed
Rosemary Lynch.

20:55.388 --> 20:58.090
But not any girl did, did they?

20:58.124 --> 21:00.092
No.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.695
It was Madeline Scott.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.734
The defense rests.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.505
Sarah, thanks again
for meeting us here.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.073
No worries.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.744
This place used to be filled
with stuff.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.546
Pillows and beds.

21:19.579 --> 21:22.048
I only got involved
with Ravi and this place

21:22.081 --> 21:25.084
pretty late senior year,
unlike the other girls.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.988
When you say
other girls were involved...

21:30.490 --> 21:32.124
what did that entail?

21:32.158 --> 21:35.061
We had sex with him,
if that's what you're asking.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.065
Both alone
and sometimes together.

21:39.098 --> 21:41.067
I'm sure it's really hard
to talk about.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.102
I've come to terms with it.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.605
We were young, dumb and high.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.073
How about the Adderall?

21:47.106 --> 21:49.409
We used it
to stay skinny for Ravi.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.910
Were there other drugs?

21:50.943 --> 21:52.412
What else were you guys on?

21:52.445 --> 21:54.614
Ravi said he had a degree
in Chinese medicine.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.550
Gave us herbal tea
and supplements all the time.

21:57.584 --> 22:00.620
The tea ceremonies...

22:00.653 --> 22:02.822
made being in this place,

22:02.855 --> 22:06.759
being with Ravi feel...
rapturous.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.463
We worshipped Ravi.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.533
That includes Rosemary.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.301
I remember she was...

22:15.334 --> 22:17.704
so intense.

22:17.737 --> 22:20.172
She quickly became
Ravi's favorite.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.915
Ravi was obviously
a serial rapist.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.583
And possibly a murderer.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.995
But to prove that, we need to
know more about his background.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.454
Starting with his full name.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.789
Ravi... or Prophet Ravi...

22:36.823 --> 22:38.825
Is the only name I ever heard.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.326
That didn't seem strange to you?

22:40.359 --> 22:41.628
No.

22:41.661 --> 22:43.229
It was kind of part
of his allure.

22:43.262 --> 22:45.331
He was a mystic.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.067
Um, one of a kind.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.937
At least to some drugged-up
17-year-olds, he was.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.707
Anything that you can tell us
might help us track him down.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.643
Wh-Where he was from,
where he lived.

22:56.676 --> 22:59.011
If anybody would know this
kind of stuff, it's Heather.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.379
She was like...

23:00.413 --> 23:03.149
his first lieutenant. Yeah,
Heather's the star witness

23:03.182 --> 23:05.518
for the prosecution, so...

23:05.552 --> 23:08.087
I don't think she's gonna be
volunteering to enlighten us.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.022
How did that happen?

23:10.056 --> 23:12.191
How did Heather end up
being the one in charge?

23:12.224 --> 23:13.693
She knew him first.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.995
Heather brought Ravi
to La Grange.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.329
Helped him find this place.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.365
Wait, so, if Heather
brought Ravi here,

23:19.398 --> 23:21.868
then do you know
where Heather met Ravi?

23:21.901 --> 23:23.670
I think at some church
in Downers Grove.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.337
Do you remember the name?

23:25.371 --> 23:26.673
Yeah, um...

23:26.706 --> 23:28.541
Tomorrow or New Day or...

23:28.575 --> 23:30.710
um, wait.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.079
It was called
New Dawn Ministries.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.048
Sarah, I know
this is a lot to ask,

23:36.082 --> 23:39.452
but we're hoping
you'll testify to all of this.

23:42.689 --> 23:45.191
Um... yeah.

23:45.224 --> 23:47.627
Glad I can finally help.

23:51.531 --> 23:52.865
Your Honor, Alberto Granados,

23:52.899 --> 23:54.867
the eyewitness
who provided my client's alibi,

23:54.901 --> 23:56.736
has just been deported.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.038
I'd like to admit
his prior testimony.

23:59.071 --> 24:02.575
- You saw Hector arrive at 700 a.m.?
- Yes.

24:02.609 --> 24:05.244
Let me get this straight.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.047
First your client gets deported,

24:08.080 --> 24:09.516
now your star witness?

24:09.549 --> 24:11.117
Your Honor, under
People v. Hellenbrand,

24:11.150 --> 24:13.419
if a witness
is rendered unavailable

24:13.452 --> 24:16.523
by an opposing party,
his prior testimony can come in.

24:16.556 --> 24:19.325
My witness was intentionally
removed from this jurisdiction.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.369
The prosecution alerted ICE
about his citizenship status...

24:21.393 --> 24:23.696
Okay, there has been
no adjudication of the truth

24:23.730 --> 24:24.931
of Granados' claims,

24:24.964 --> 24:27.800
and Mr. Boudreau's accusations
are just outrageous.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.803
The State had nothing to do
with the deportation

24:30.837 --> 24:33.305
of Mr. Granados
by agents of ICE.

24:33.339 --> 24:35.942
This court denies
Defendant's motion.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.878
I-If you can find Mr. Granados,
he can testify.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.614
But his statement...
Sworn or not, it's out.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.886
Sorry, Boudreau,
but it wasn't me.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.822
Maybe if you weren't so hung up
on your law partner...

24:49.856 --> 24:51.423
You're lying.

24:51.457 --> 24:53.693
But I'll win anyway.

24:56.796 --> 24:59.465
Hector Costa's case went
from slam dunk to disaster.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.067
Granados was deported.

25:01.100 --> 25:04.537
So, if the prosecutor
didn't turn your witness in

25:04.571 --> 25:06.505
- to ICE, who did?
- Good question.

25:06.539 --> 25:08.608
Maybe it was the real killer.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.409
Any idea on where to find him?

25:10.442 --> 25:12.278
Maybe.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.783
Let me do some digging.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.951
Hello. What's up, girl?

25:20.319 --> 25:21.654
I'm working, why?

25:23.455 --> 25:25.858
Yes, Nikki,
I'm committed to you.

25:25.892 --> 25:28.628
Right, right. No, no, no, no.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.472
I'm gonna pick him up
from school. I didn't forget.

25:30.496 --> 25:32.464
Yeah, I'm on my way right now.
I'm almost there.

25:32.498 --> 25:34.266
- Do you like him? Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.035
- What are you gonna name him?
- Hawk.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.771
Hawk? What's his superpower?

25:38.805 --> 25:40.973
- Lasers.
- Lasers?

25:41.007 --> 25:43.109
How you doing?
I've missed you, buddy.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.644
- How's Nikki doing?
- Good.

25:44.677 --> 25:47.513
- Hey, Nathan.
- Hi, Uncle Bodie. This is my mom.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.891
Nathan was just telling me
about you.

25:48.915 --> 25:52.084
I'm Daniella, Nikki's sister.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.421
I'm...

25:55.454 --> 25:58.057
I'm not supposed to be here.

25:58.090 --> 26:00.392
No, no, you're not.

26:00.426 --> 26:01.904
Let's go do something fun
today, yeah?

26:01.928 --> 26:03.162
Okay.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.506
Watch your step,
it's slippery here.

26:04.530 --> 26:05.965
- You got it?
- Yep.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.967
All right, cool.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.336
I'm sure that Nikki hasn't said
the nicest things about me.

26:10.369 --> 26:12.171
Well, I mean, you know.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.173
She's a cop and...

26:14.206 --> 26:15.842
you're a junkie, so, no.

26:15.875 --> 26:18.845
I've been clean
for ten months now.

26:18.878 --> 26:21.280
I think I deserve to see my son.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.884
Well, that's not up to me.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.619
At all. So, good luck.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.421
- Bye, Nathan.
- Bye, Mom.

26:29.455 --> 26:30.857
I'll see you soon, okay?

26:30.890 --> 26:32.024
Okay, bye.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.893
Hey, would you just talk
to Nikki for me?

26:33.926 --> 26:36.095
Please?

26:41.801 --> 26:44.603
I'm getting worried, Gore.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.105
This whole...

26:46.138 --> 26:47.573
cult thing...

26:47.606 --> 26:49.776
is a great story,
people are eating it up.

26:49.809 --> 26:52.544
I spent a fortune on you winning
and I'm eating it up.

26:52.578 --> 26:54.046
This is a serious problem.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.447
I've got it covered.

26:55.481 --> 26:57.884
Is it salacious? Yes.

26:57.917 --> 27:00.386
But it's just an absurd
and desperate attempt

27:00.419 --> 27:01.888
to find an alternative suspect.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.389
You sure about that?

27:03.422 --> 27:05.357
The original trial...
That was all about sex.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.202
The word "cult" fits
right into that narrative.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.661
So does the word "guilty."

27:11.964 --> 27:13.565
I hope so.

27:13.599 --> 27:15.401
The arrest did wonders
for your numbers,

27:15.434 --> 27:18.404
but if she's found not guilty...

27:18.437 --> 27:21.073
it's gonna sink more
than just your campaign.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.374
Excuse me?

27:22.408 --> 27:24.711
You're gonna look
like a lunatic.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.813
Or a monster. You know, to...

27:26.846 --> 27:29.615
to retry her
after all these years

27:29.648 --> 27:31.951
and then get it wrong. Again.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.186
I told you, don't worry.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.255
I've got it under control.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.891
Welcome to Sunshine Church.

27:38.925 --> 27:40.626
I am Reverend Malloy.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.994
Ezekiel Boudreau.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.863
This is my partner
Madeline Scott.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.832
Are you two looking
for a new church?

27:45.865 --> 27:48.500
We have an excellent
pre-marriage counseling program.

27:50.136 --> 27:51.838
No, he actually means
we're law partners.

27:51.871 --> 27:53.840
I see.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.274
So how can I help you?

27:55.307 --> 27:57.844
We wanted to ask you
about Heather Dupinski.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.287
She was a congregant
at New Dawn Ministries.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.347
That's your
former church, right?

28:01.380 --> 28:03.549
Yes. You must've looked me up.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.284
I remember Heather.

28:05.317 --> 28:08.788
Do your questions have anything
to do with Robert Carter?

28:08.821 --> 28:11.457
Um... possibly.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.092
We're looking for a guy
who knew her.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.961
He went by the name Ravi.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.964
The fact that he began using
that name is one of the reasons

28:17.997 --> 28:21.300
that we dissolved our
partnership and closed the doors

28:21.333 --> 28:23.836
on New Dawn Ministries
many years ago.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.413
We think he may have
murdered a teenage girl.

28:25.437 --> 28:28.340
Anything that you can
tell us would help.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.542
At the dissolution
of our partnership,

28:30.576 --> 28:33.112
I signed
a non-disparagement clause.

28:33.145 --> 28:36.415
An NDA is rendered unenforceable
when the protected party dies.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.885
The Devil never dies.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.219
You're saying he's still alive?

28:42.088 --> 28:43.689
Look, if you help us,
we can ensure

28:43.722 --> 28:45.624
you will face
no legal ramifications.

28:45.657 --> 28:49.128
Sunshine Church is a place
of joy and harmony.

28:49.161 --> 28:52.131
Has nothing to do
with New Dawn Ministries.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.767
My association
with Robert Carter...

28:54.801 --> 28:57.069
almost destroyed
everything I built once.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.471
I won't chance that again.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.841
Now, if you'll excuse me.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.283
Where are we
on the Hector Costa case?

29:11.317 --> 29:14.253
I know this guy in Joliet, he's
stacking time for burglaries.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.923
So...

29:16.956 --> 29:18.767
I show him all the pictures
from the crime scene,

29:18.791 --> 29:20.960
and right away he pegs it
as a rank amateur.

29:20.993 --> 29:22.805
- Why?
- No one would ransack a house in the middle of the night.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.330
It's gonna wake up
all the neighbors.

29:24.363 --> 29:25.597
Right?

29:25.631 --> 29:27.299
Wrong. I combed the file.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.634
Not one noise complaint

29:28.667 --> 29:30.169
- from that night.
- Which means?

29:30.202 --> 29:31.603
Which means
it wasn't a burglary.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.806
It was set up to look
like a burglary. Like this.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.007
You see this bedside table?

29:35.041 --> 29:36.351
Looks like it was knocked over
when the burglar

29:36.375 --> 29:37.343
came through the window, right?

29:37.376 --> 29:39.946
But check out the crystal lamp
on the ground.

29:39.979 --> 29:42.348
- Why isn't it broken?
- Because it wasn't knocked over,

29:42.381 --> 29:44.350
it was placed there
carefully and quietly.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.561
All right, so if this wasn't
a random burglary gone wrong,

29:46.585 --> 29:48.988
it wasn't a random killing.
This was personal.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.098
I like the husband for this.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.357
But the cops vetted him.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.425
His alibi checked out.
He was on a business trip.

29:53.459 --> 29:54.760
Come on. You see how hinky

29:54.793 --> 29:56.095
he was acting at the trial?

29:56.128 --> 29:57.864
That's the world's biggest dick.

29:57.897 --> 30:00.599
No, this hearing is making
a mockery of my wife's death.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.435
Yeah, a dick that was 300 miles
away at a trade convention.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.837
280. Last time he was seen

30:04.871 --> 30:06.873
was around midnight
at the hotel.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.540
Let's say he drives
85 miles per hour.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.776
That gives him three hours
to get home,

30:10.809 --> 30:12.855
two hours to kill the missus
and stage the crime scene.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.947
Then three hours
to drive back just in time

30:14.981 --> 30:16.341
to be seen
at the breakfast buffet.

30:17.349 --> 30:18.660
- It's a stretch.
- Yeah, it's a stretch,

30:18.684 --> 30:20.752
but it's possible,
and that's what matters.

30:20.786 --> 30:22.488
No, what matters
is if it's provable.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.656
It's provable.

30:24.690 --> 30:26.225
I'm on it.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.460
Actually, this is gonna
take a while.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.829
I mean, with your sitch
and everything,

30:30.863 --> 30:32.340
maybe I should...
should just stay here.

30:32.364 --> 30:33.866
No, my...

30:33.900 --> 30:36.835
Seriously, go.

30:36.869 --> 30:39.205
Hey, my sitch is totally fine.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.944
Okay, I guess
we're gonna talk about it.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.215
I could go back to jail.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.217
No, that's not gonna happen.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.551
Not a chance.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.162
We don't know what Bellows
has up his sleeve

30:54.186 --> 30:56.355
and we still haven't found Levi.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.033
I'm gonna say this once,
'cause I know that

30:58.057 --> 30:59.868
if I'm convicted,
you guys are gonna fight for me

30:59.892 --> 31:02.328
until the end of time.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.396
I love you for it,
but I don't want that.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.698
What are you talking about?

31:06.732 --> 31:08.134
I'm talking about this place.

31:08.167 --> 31:12.104
The dozens of wrongfully
convicted that we've exonerated,

31:12.138 --> 31:14.173
the hundreds more
that we could help.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.275
I want you to focus on them.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.110
- We can do both.
- Not that we're going

31:18.144 --> 31:20.846
to have to, because you're not
going to jail, Maddie.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.416
Bodie, you have somewhere
to be, right?

31:25.884 --> 31:27.319
Go be there.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.022
Okay.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.562
It's gonna be okay.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.464
What do we got?

31:38.497 --> 31:40.275
Do we have anything more
concrete on Robert Carter?

31:40.299 --> 31:42.101
Didn't turn up much.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.502
He's definitely a con man.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.437
A few arrests
but only one felony,

31:45.471 --> 31:46.939
for possession with intent.

31:46.973 --> 31:49.141
And no connection to Rosemary
or the crime scene?

31:49.175 --> 31:51.910
Not yet. And after
Rosemary's death all evidence,

31:51.944 --> 31:54.746
records of him...
Just basically... vanishes.

31:54.780 --> 31:58.050
Only supporting the theory
that he's dead.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.551
Great.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.420
What about Sarah?

32:01.453 --> 32:04.356
She'll give us an affidavit,
probably even testify,

32:04.390 --> 32:06.258
but her testimony
only gets us so far.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.194
Right. She left early

32:08.227 --> 32:09.771
the night of the campout,
which means she wasn't there

32:09.795 --> 32:11.430
at the time of Rosemary's death

32:11.463 --> 32:15.101
and she never saw Heather
or Ravi Carter be violent.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.437
We need more.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.275
What about the other cult girl?

32:23.309 --> 32:25.044
Linda Barrett?

32:25.077 --> 32:26.945
Let's find her.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.682
Okay.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.208
You own this joint?

32:56.242 --> 32:58.877
You recognize this guy?

32:58.910 --> 33:00.512
He might've stopped
for gas here about,

33:00.546 --> 33:02.214
I don't know, five years ago?

33:09.388 --> 33:11.390
You ever see this guy?
You recognize this guy?

33:11.423 --> 33:12.823
Have you ever seen
this dude before?

33:17.696 --> 33:19.465
Have you ever seen
this guy before?

33:20.766 --> 33:22.068
Can you look again?

33:27.839 --> 33:30.176
Hey, dude. Let me get,
$20 on pump three, yeah?

33:30.209 --> 33:32.211
And I also got this

33:32.244 --> 33:35.381
bladder-buster-sized
cherry Slurpee.

33:35.414 --> 33:38.384
By the way,
have you seen this guy?

33:39.851 --> 33:42.721
I don't know. Have I?

33:44.290 --> 33:46.258
Yep.

33:46.292 --> 33:48.260
I don't blame you.

34:08.980 --> 34:10.081
Hey, Linda.

34:10.116 --> 34:12.551
Funny bumping into you here.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.286
Hysterical.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.554
I need to ask you
a few questions.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.690
We're in the middle
of something.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.060
I can ask you here if you want.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.706
- Know what? I'll be right back, you guys.
- Yeah.

34:28.134 --> 34:29.568
That's my partner Easy.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.543
I already told you guys
everything I know

34:38.577 --> 34:39.710
about Rosemary.

34:39.745 --> 34:40.946
Not everything, Linda.

34:40.978 --> 34:42.781
We got it all.

34:42.813 --> 34:45.317
Ravi, the cult, the drugs.

34:45.351 --> 34:47.453
- We just need a witness.
- And if you don't step up,

34:47.485 --> 34:49.297
Madeline goes back to prison
for the rest of her life

34:49.321 --> 34:52.158
for something we all know
she didn't do.

34:52.190 --> 34:53.301
Did you meet up
with the other girls

34:53.324 --> 34:54.626
the night Rosemary was killed?

34:54.659 --> 34:56.828
Yeah.

34:56.862 --> 34:59.131
At the quarry?

34:59.165 --> 35:01.200
And the guy Ravi was there?

35:02.634 --> 35:04.970
He was supposed to be,
but I never saw him.

35:05.003 --> 35:08.073
Heather told us
that he canceled.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.984
But then, when you and Levi
found Rosemary's body

35:10.008 --> 35:12.444
the next morning, it...

35:12.478 --> 35:14.613
didn't feel like a coincidence,
you know?

35:14.646 --> 35:17.749
Do you think
Ravi killed Rosemary?

35:19.785 --> 35:23.255
I'm so sorry.

35:23.289 --> 35:26.525
Linda, I need you to testify.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.827
If you don't, I...

35:28.860 --> 35:30.896
I know. Okay?

35:32.931 --> 35:35.501
I'll testify.

35:39.405 --> 35:42.073
It was around 500 a.m. The guy
bought a full tank of gas,

35:42.107 --> 35:43.575
paid cash inside.

35:43.609 --> 35:44.976
And do you see the person

35:45.010 --> 35:47.946
you sold gas to that morning
sitting in court today?

35:47.979 --> 35:49.715
I do. Right there.

35:52.184 --> 35:53.552
Your Honor,
let the record reflect

35:53.585 --> 35:54.953
the witness has indicated

35:54.986 --> 35:56.655
the victim's husband,
Stephen Brennan.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.690
So reflected.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.494
How many customers

36:02.528 --> 36:04.496
do you serve
at the counter every day?

36:04.530 --> 36:06.498
- Maybe a hundred?
- Hundred.

36:06.532 --> 36:09.301
Wow. Okay, so,
five shifts a week,

36:09.335 --> 36:10.902
that's 500 people a week.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.872
Over the course of five years,
that's 130,000 people.

36:13.905 --> 36:15.207
If you say so.

36:15.241 --> 36:17.409
Well, they all must
blur together, right?

36:17.443 --> 36:21.012
Sure. But I remember
that guy specifically.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.651
Why is that, Mr. Harkins?

36:25.684 --> 36:28.254
Because he drove off with
the gas pump still in his car.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.688
Dislodged the hose
from the tank.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.690
We had a whole argument
about what a idiot he was.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.859
Turns out he was in a rush

36:33.892 --> 36:35.537
- 'cause he just murdered his wife.
- Objection.

36:35.561 --> 36:38.930
Sustained. Mr. Harkins, please
don't draw any conclusions.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.300
Yep. Definitely him.

36:42.434 --> 36:45.604
Your Honor, defense moves
for a directed verdict.

36:56.081 --> 36:57.549
Your Honor, Stephen Brennan

36:57.583 --> 37:00.619
has just confessed
to murdering his wife.

37:00.652 --> 37:03.689
The State moves to dismiss
all charges against Mr. Costa.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.692
In that case, Mr. Costa,

37:06.725 --> 37:08.994
you are free to go.

37:10.128 --> 37:12.163
Enjoy your freedom.

37:17.369 --> 37:19.638
I'll make sure his DACA status
is reinstated.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.640
Thanks.

37:22.974 --> 37:25.644
Hey, Easy... nice job.

37:27.446 --> 37:30.616
And I hope everything
works out for Madeline.

37:43.962 --> 37:46.197
Mr. Boudreau,
you've had your three days.

37:46.231 --> 37:47.999
Please enlighten us
about Robert Carter,

37:48.033 --> 37:51.437
aka the Prophet Ravi,
and this cult of his.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.939
Your Honor, the alleged facts
in this case do not support

37:53.972 --> 37:56.174
use of the word "cult,"
a word chosen

37:56.207 --> 38:00.078
by counsel solely
for its incendiary value.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.981
Robert Carter cofounded
New Dawn Ministries,

38:03.014 --> 38:05.584
a for-profit religious
organization identified

38:05.617 --> 38:07.486
as a cult by leading experts
in the field.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.187
Tell me, Ms. Scott,

38:09.220 --> 38:10.522
are you present today
in the role

38:10.556 --> 38:11.766
of defendant or pro se counsel?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.692
And if the latter, what role

38:13.725 --> 38:16.027
will the dapper gentleman
at your side be playing?

38:16.061 --> 38:17.696
Apologies, Your Honor.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.297
Old habits.

38:19.331 --> 38:21.266
After being forced
out of New Dawn,

38:21.299 --> 38:23.769
Carter founded
the Emergent Light Temple.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.804
Despite the grandiose name,
the temple amounted

38:25.837 --> 38:27.473
to little more
than a farmhouse basement

38:27.506 --> 38:30.208
where he exploited dozens
of underage girls.

38:30.241 --> 38:32.811
- What's your evidence?
- We have sworn affidavits

38:32.844 --> 38:36.081
of two of Carter's victims...

38:36.114 --> 38:37.816
Sarah Tawney and Linda Barrett,

38:37.849 --> 38:41.319
both classmates
of Rosemary Lynch and Ms. Scott.

38:41.353 --> 38:43.822
Ms. Barrett was present
the night of the murder

38:43.855 --> 38:45.991
and testified
at my client's first trial.

38:46.024 --> 38:48.326
Your Honor,
I'm at a bit of a loss.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.897
We have two witnesses
who are not here

38:51.930 --> 38:54.065
and a nefarious cult leader

38:54.099 --> 38:56.502
who is conveniently deceased,

38:56.535 --> 38:59.571
thus, likewise, unavailable
for a cross-examination.

38:59.605 --> 39:00.906
Mr. Boudreau, can you provide

39:00.939 --> 39:03.241
any independent evidence

39:03.274 --> 39:05.677
that corroborates your
witnesses' written statements?

39:05.711 --> 39:07.913
We can. Reverend Malloy,
the cofounder

39:07.946 --> 39:10.716
of New Dawn Ministries
with Robert Carter,

39:10.749 --> 39:12.651
will testify in open court
that Robert Carter

39:12.684 --> 39:15.220
was forced out of New Dawn
due to allegations

39:15.253 --> 39:18.924
of inappropriate sexual conduct
with underage girls.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.358
Statutory rape
is a serious crime

39:20.392 --> 39:22.394
but not necessarily
a violent one.

39:22.428 --> 39:24.430
Drug-facilitated aggravated rape
is, however,

39:24.463 --> 39:27.198
categorized as a violent felony.

39:27.232 --> 39:28.834
He drugged these girls?

39:28.867 --> 39:32.037
With a notorious date rape drug,
gamma hydroxybutyrate,

39:32.070 --> 39:34.339
aka GHB.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.017
This is nonsense.
How on earth do you propose

39:36.041 --> 39:38.109
to support that claim?

39:38.143 --> 39:40.378
We didn't even screen for GHB
18 years ago.

39:40.412 --> 39:43.449
Well, you may not have,
but La Grange High School did.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.817
Sorry, Your Honor,
it's... last time.

39:45.851 --> 39:47.686
We're still one degree
of separation

39:47.719 --> 39:50.021
from your victim.
Can you connect Robert Carter

39:50.055 --> 39:51.623
with Rosemary Lynch?

39:51.657 --> 39:53.258
Through the crime scene,
Your Honor.

39:53.291 --> 39:55.461
Ms. Barrett's statement
places him in the quarry

39:55.494 --> 39:56.862
the night Ms. Lynch was killed.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.029
Okay, Mr. Boudreau,

39:58.063 --> 39:59.698
I'm satisfied
vis-à-vis Robert Carter.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.901
You may present him as an
alternative suspect to the jury.

40:02.934 --> 40:06.104
How does your second proffered
suspect, Ms. Heather Dupinski,

40:06.137 --> 40:07.639
fit into this?

40:07.673 --> 40:10.375
Ms. Dupinski perjured herself
at my client's first trial,

40:10.408 --> 40:12.478
offering devastating
and false testimony

40:12.511 --> 40:14.713
against Madeline and Levi Scott.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.716
That testimony
was found by a jury

40:17.749 --> 40:19.317
to be highly credible,

40:19.350 --> 40:21.820
as well as Ms. Dupinski's
confirmed alibi.

40:21.853 --> 40:24.422
Her alibi was confirmed
by Linda Barrett,

40:24.456 --> 40:27.392
who now admits it to be
a complete fabrication.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.227
Did you have anything else,
Mr. Bellows,

40:29.260 --> 40:31.997
or are you ready to quit
while you're behind?

40:40.939 --> 40:43.374
You shouldn't have let my sister
get anywhere near him.

40:43.408 --> 40:44.552
What am I supposed
to do, Nikki...

40:44.576 --> 40:46.244
Drag him away
kicking and screaming?

40:46.277 --> 40:48.580
Yes. Yes, that's exactly
what you're supposed to do.

40:48.614 --> 40:50.749
Look, parenting isn't
about letting the kid

40:50.782 --> 40:52.083
just do whatever he wants.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.753
If he could make his own
decisions, he wouldn't need us.

40:54.786 --> 40:57.823
- Okay, I get it, but...
- But what?

40:57.856 --> 41:00.091
She's his mother, Nikki.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.393
Yeah, yeah,
she gave birth to him.

41:02.427 --> 41:03.938
And she screwed up
every single chance she's had

41:03.962 --> 41:07.933
to be his actual mom, which
is why I got to fight like hell

41:07.966 --> 41:09.467
to retain custody.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.438
She filed, Bodie.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.442
- Whoa...
- She wants to take Nathan from me.

41:19.578 --> 41:20.955
I don't know,
maybe you guys can work out

41:20.979 --> 41:22.280
some kind of an arrangement.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.115
No, no, no,
there's nothing we can work out.

41:24.149 --> 41:26.852
No, the second she's...
the second she's got him alone,

41:26.885 --> 41:28.654
she'll kidnap him
and he'll end up

41:28.687 --> 41:30.388
in some crack house
somewhere, okay?

41:30.421 --> 41:32.891
I-I'm not kidding.
I'm never gonna see him again.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.861
She's a lost cause, Bodie,

41:35.894 --> 41:38.105
and you falling for her charms
is the worst thing for Nathan.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.631
I didn't fall for her charms.

41:39.665 --> 41:41.600
I get it now.

41:41.633 --> 41:43.268
Do you?

41:43.301 --> 41:46.137
'Cause I'm...

41:46.171 --> 41:47.839
I don't know,
I'm starting to wonder

41:47.873 --> 41:51.476
whether bringing you into
his life was the right call.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.946
It was the right call, okay?

41:54.980 --> 41:57.583
It was.

41:57.616 --> 41:59.585
I'm gonna prove it to you.

41:59.618 --> 42:01.352
All right? I'm gonna do
everything I can

42:01.386 --> 42:03.889
to make sure that Nathan
stays in your life.

42:04.990 --> 42:06.992
I promise.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.627
I'm trusting you, Bodie.

42:08.660 --> 42:09.895
Good.

42:11.396 --> 42:13.531
Good.

42:13.565 --> 42:14.833
We got this.

42:18.670 --> 42:21.840
I imagine you know
why I've asked you here.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.809
You've decided
to drop all the charges

42:23.842 --> 42:25.977
and resign from your office
in disgrace?

42:32.851 --> 42:35.821
That's your offer?

42:35.854 --> 42:36.988
20 years?

42:37.022 --> 42:38.824
After yesterday's hearing?

42:38.857 --> 42:41.159
With time served,
it's effectively ten.

42:41.192 --> 42:42.260
It's a gift.

42:42.293 --> 42:43.895
It's a joke.

42:43.929 --> 42:46.665
- You're welcome to counter.
- Not guilty.

42:46.698 --> 42:48.175
And a guarantee
against future prosecution

42:48.199 --> 42:49.901
of Madeline and her brother,

42:49.935 --> 42:52.771
and we agree not to sue you
for malicious prosecution.

42:56.207 --> 42:58.176
Let's go.

42:58.209 --> 42:59.911
He's got nothing.

43:01.613 --> 43:03.081
I've got everything.

43:04.515 --> 43:05.884
I've got Levi.

43:06.752 --> 43:07.986
You arrested him?

43:08.019 --> 43:09.655
We filed a habeas writ.

43:09.688 --> 43:11.657
He wasn't arrested.

43:11.690 --> 43:13.959
He's in protective custody.

43:13.992 --> 43:16.232
He doesn't need any guarantees
against future prosecution

43:16.261 --> 43:19.765
because he has already
been granted immunity...

43:22.467 --> 43:24.936
for testifying against you.

44:08.046 --> 44:10.015
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH.

44:12.150 --> 44:14.161
You've seen the fight
for justice on Proven Innocent.

44:14.185 --> 44:16.554
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:19.057 --> 44:21.760
Rule number one
if you want to stay alive.

44:21.793 --> 44:23.661
Don't lie to your doctor.

44:26.865 --> 44:29.935
- Profits over patients, again.
- You save your morality lesson.

44:29.968 --> 44:31.302
You have to save him!

44:31.336 --> 44:33.404
Be careful.

44:33.438 --> 44:35.440
- You tried to kill him.
- I had no choice!

44:39.444 --> 44:40.812
Shall we?

44:43.681 --> 44:46.918
The Resident,
all new, Mondays at 800 on Fox.

44:50.388 --> 44:52.223
As they began
their hours of duty...

44:53.658 --> 44:56.427
it was a bell
that started it off.

44:57.628 --> 45:00.165
Each alarm was sounded
by a bell...

45:00.198 --> 45:02.901
that called them to place
their lives in jeopardy...

45:02.934 --> 45:06.037
for the good
of their fellow man.

45:06.071 --> 45:08.673
When the alarm had come
to an end,

45:08.706 --> 45:11.409
the bell rang,
to signal that end.

45:11.442 --> 45:13.845
9-1-1? What is your emergency?

45:13.879 --> 45:19.117
9-1-1. All new,
Mondays at 900 on Fox.
