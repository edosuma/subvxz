00:39.434 --> 00:41.901
I didn't know anybody was in here.

00:42.534 --> 00:44.366
Are you looking for Rodney?

00:44.401 --> 00:45.501
Because I saw him in the mess hall.

00:45.536 --> 00:47.066
Rodney?

00:47.101 --> 00:48.234
Yup. are you all right?

00:48.269 --> 00:49.565
Yeah.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.101
You just seem a little... confused.

00:56.733 --> 00:58.367
Are you ill?

00:58.402 --> 00:59.799
No.

00:59.834 --> 01:02.134
No, no, no, I just, uh...

01:02.169 --> 01:03.984
I... don't...

01:04.019 --> 01:05.800
Where am I?

01:06.800 --> 01:09.101
You're in one of our auxiliary labs,

01:09.136 --> 01:11.568
East pier, level four?

01:13.867 --> 01:15.334
Here, why don't you sit down?

01:15.369 --> 01:16.732
It's OK...

01:16.767 --> 01:18.568
No, really. I mean, I'll radio
Rodney, I'll just...

01:18.603 --> 01:21.401
No, no, you don't need to do that.

01:22.700 --> 01:25.101
Better yet, let... why don't you lie down?

01:25.136 --> 01:27.034
Walk with me to the infirmary,

01:27.069 --> 01:28.166
And they'll examine you,

01:28.201 --> 01:29.284
They'll... they'll... they'll...

01:29.319 --> 01:30.367
Just see if there's anything...

02:10.967 --> 02:13.684
<b><font color=#38B0DE>STARGATE ATLANTIS

03:17.734 --> 03:20.299
There you are! I've been
looking all over for you.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.533
Is your radio not working?
I called, like, 1,000 times!

03:21.568 --> 03:23.034
Um... I...

03:24.201 --> 03:25.633
I just want to check your earwig.

03:25.668 --> 03:26.917
Here we go.

03:26.952 --> 03:28.132
There we go...

03:28.167 --> 03:29.667
It was probably just a dead battery.

03:29.702 --> 03:31.132
Come on, it's schnitzel day.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.900
We've got to hurry, though,
because it's going fast.

03:33.935 --> 03:34.934
So what happened?

03:34.969 --> 03:35.899
What do you mean?

03:35.934 --> 03:37.232
Well, hello? our lunch date?

03:37.267 --> 03:38.267
You were supposed to meet me, like,

03:38.302 --> 03:39.299
Half an hour ago.

03:39.334 --> 03:40.917
I must have forgotten.

03:40.952 --> 03:42.509
Hey. what's wrong?

03:42.544 --> 03:44.032
You seem distracted.

03:44.067 --> 03:45.633
Is something bothering you?

03:45.668 --> 03:46.966
Did I do something?

03:47.001 --> 03:48.867
Oh... I did, didn't I? what'd I do?

03:48.902 --> 03:50.633
Nothing. I'm just... I'm not...

03:50.668 --> 03:52.732
Dr. Keller?

03:52.767 --> 03:54.600
Dr. Keller! please respond.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.034
Just a second.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.399
It's for you.

03:57.434 --> 03:59.267
Working fine, apparently.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.799
Uh, hello?

04:01.834 --> 04:03.399
Dr. Keller, we have an emergency.

04:03.434 --> 04:05.334
Dr. Zelenka has been seriously injured!

04:05.369 --> 04:06.832
Dr. Zelenka?

04:06.867 --> 04:08.517
What's wrong with Zelenka?

04:08.552 --> 04:10.132
Is he complaining about

04:10.167 --> 04:11.498
Another one of his so-called migraines?

04:11.533 --> 04:12.967
Because, if he is, you can just
send him right down to the...

04:13.002 --> 04:14.632
He's been stabbed!

04:14.667 --> 04:16.434
What? stabbed? what do you mean, stabbed?

04:16.469 --> 04:17.834
Like, with a knife, stabbed?

04:17.869 --> 04:19.132
By whom?

04:19.166 --> 04:20.399
I don't know, an s. o. just radioed us.

04:20.435 --> 04:21.718
They found him on the floor of his lab.

04:21.753 --> 04:23.027
He's unconscious, losing a lot of blood.

04:23.062 --> 04:24.301
They're rushing him to the infirmary.

04:24.336 --> 04:25.633
All right, we're on our way.

04:33.734 --> 04:35.201
His pressure's dropping. 60 over 40.

04:35.236 --> 04:36.884
Pulse rapid, skin diaphoretic.

04:36.919 --> 04:38.533
The scan shows internal bleeding,

04:38.568 --> 04:39.765
Laceration of the liver.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.333
So, what... is he going to die?

04:41.368 --> 04:44.201
He needs immediate surgery.
He's in hypovolemic shock.

04:46.201 --> 04:47.399
Doctor?

04:47.434 --> 04:48.567
Yes. Yes, he needs surgery.

04:48.602 --> 04:49.868
We're prepping the o. r.

04:49.903 --> 04:51.134
Dr. mcbride will assist you.

04:51.169 --> 04:52.166
He's already scrubbing.

04:52.201 --> 04:54.167
We'll be set to go as soon as you're ready.

04:55.301 --> 04:56.751
Jennifer...

04:56.786 --> 04:58.166
Jennifer!

04:58.201 --> 05:00.201
You're acting weird. what's wrong with you?

05:00.236 --> 05:01.433
Nothing.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.600
Nothing. I need to get ready.

05:41.101 --> 05:42.967
Doctor?

05:47.468 --> 05:50.468
I'm not feeling very well.

05:50.503 --> 05:51.999
Take over for me.

05:52.034 --> 05:55.600
I'm going to go lie down.

06:01.301 --> 06:02.966
How'd it go?

06:03.001 --> 06:04.334
They've managed to stop the bleeding,

06:04.369 --> 06:05.368
But he's lost a lot of blood.

06:05.403 --> 06:06.451
Is he awake yet?

06:06.486 --> 06:07.576
No. he's in a coma.

06:07.611 --> 06:08.632
It's a light coma.

06:08.667 --> 06:09.999
They figure he should recover,

06:10.034 --> 06:12.032
Barring any, you know, complications.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.401
I hear dr. Keller didn't
perform the surgery?

06:14.436 --> 06:16.168
No. no, she... excused herself.

06:16.203 --> 06:17.900
She said she wasn't feeling well.

06:17.935 --> 06:18.734
What's wrong with her?

06:18.769 --> 06:19.765
You tell me.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.001
I mean, she's been acting strange all day.

06:21.036 --> 06:22.366
Aloof, distracted.

06:22.401 --> 06:24.167
I found her wandering
Atlantis, looking lost.

06:24.202 --> 06:25.334
Then I got her to the infirmary,

06:25.369 --> 06:26.366
But she just stood there

06:26.401 --> 06:27.567
Like she'd never held a scalpel before.

06:27.602 --> 06:28.865
Where is she now?

06:28.900 --> 06:31.216
In her quarters, resting.

06:31.251 --> 06:33.498
Dr. Beckett is due back soon.

06:33.533 --> 06:36.600
I'll have him examine her
for any possible contagion,

06:36.635 --> 06:39.667
Or, God forbid, another one
of those parasitic organisms.

06:39.702 --> 06:42.999
Better safe than sorry.

06:43.034 --> 06:45.500
Any leads yet as to who might
have done this to dr. Zelenka?

06:45.535 --> 06:47.201
No witnesses, no sign of struggle.

06:47.236 --> 06:48.899
I want a full investigation.

06:48.934 --> 06:51.517
Use every resource, no stone unturned.

06:51.552 --> 06:54.101
One of our people is lying in a coma...

06:54.136 --> 06:55.267
Light coma.

06:57.633 --> 07:00.800
...and I want to know who's responsible.

07:29.468 --> 07:31.800
What the hell's going on here?

07:35.800 --> 07:37.900
Heard you weren't feeling well.

07:37.935 --> 07:40.565
No.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.633
Can I come in?

07:42.668 --> 07:44.667
All right.

07:47.001 --> 07:49.734
So. what's wrong with you?

07:49.769 --> 07:51.032
I don't know.

07:51.067 --> 07:54.532
I'm just... tired.

07:54.567 --> 07:57.934
Been pushing yourself real hard lately.

07:57.969 --> 07:58.966
Yes...

07:59.001 --> 08:00.366
Well, uh, you know me.

08:00.401 --> 08:03.967
I'm always pushing myself real hard.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.401
What?

08:10.034 --> 08:11.500
Nothing.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.299
Anyway,

08:14.334 --> 08:15.333
I'll be fine.

08:15.368 --> 08:16.667
I just need some...

08:18.434 --> 08:20.234
Am I... interrupting?

08:20.269 --> 08:21.765
No.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.433
Good. I mean, um...

08:24.468 --> 08:26.633
I just dropped by to let you know that, uh,

08:26.668 --> 08:29.465
Beckett is on his way back.

08:29.500 --> 08:33.967
He'll be able to fill in for
you while you're, um... ill.

08:34.001 --> 08:35.565
Great.

08:35.600 --> 08:36.565
Yeah, we've, uh,

08:36.600 --> 08:38.533
Sent a puddle jumper for him.

08:38.568 --> 08:39.565
A puddle jumper?

08:39.600 --> 08:40.799
Well, he's in some remote desert village,

08:40.833 --> 08:43.533
And it'll take too long to
walk back to the gate,

08:43.568 --> 08:45.867
So, it's easier to, you know, hitch a ride.

08:45.902 --> 08:49.001
A ride on a puddle jumper.

08:49.036 --> 08:50.533
Yeah.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.465
Maybe we should leave,

08:59.500 --> 09:02.667
You know, let her get some rest?

09:02.702 --> 09:04.834
Yeah.

09:12.034 --> 09:14.967
Call me... if you need anything.

09:15.002 --> 09:16.967
I will.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.266
Nothing out of the usual,

09:36.301 --> 09:38.667
No sign of trauma or any kind of organism.

09:38.702 --> 09:40.034
What about her blood work?

09:40.069 --> 09:41.800
The same.

09:43.867 --> 09:46.134
How long have you been feeling like this?

09:47.368 --> 09:50.066
Um... a day or so?

09:50.101 --> 09:52.266
Have you been sleeping all right?

09:52.301 --> 09:54.284
No. I've been pushing myself real hard.

09:54.319 --> 09:56.267
Aye. well, I'd like to keep you overnight

09:56.302 --> 09:57.399
For observation.

09:57.434 --> 09:59.134
I'll give you something to help you sleep,

09:59.169 --> 10:00.468
And we'll monitor your condition.

10:00.503 --> 10:01.632
Then, hopefully,

10:01.667 --> 10:03.301
You'll wake up in the morning refreshed,

10:03.336 --> 10:05.267
Back to your old self. OK?

10:07.834 --> 10:10.067
You're certain you saw nothing at all?

10:10.102 --> 10:11.598
She's fine...

10:11.633 --> 10:13.899
Physically speaking.

10:13.934 --> 10:16.667
If there's something wrong with her,

10:16.702 --> 10:19.151
I'm afraid it's most likely

10:19.186 --> 10:21.600
Psychological in nature.

10:54.533 --> 10:55.532
Hello...

10:55.567 --> 10:56.799
All these corridors,

10:56.834 --> 10:58.300
I keep getting turned around.

10:58.335 --> 10:59.767
The puddle jumper is... where?

10:59.802 --> 11:00.767
The jumper bay?
186?
00:11:00,802 --> 00:11:01,732
Yes.

11:01.767 --> 11:03.200
Top of the central tower.

11:03.235 --> 11:04.598
Right. yeah, I know that.

11:04.633 --> 11:06.132
I just need to, um... how do I...?

11:06.167 --> 11:08.101
Oh, the transporter's at
the end of the corridor.

11:08.136 --> 11:09.532
It'll take you there.

11:09.567 --> 11:11.234
Transporter. of course. thank you.

11:11.269 --> 11:13.667
You're welcome.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.567
Ah... perfect.

11:47.934 --> 11:50.034
Come on, come on. come on.

11:52.633 --> 11:54.883
What are you doing?

11:54.918 --> 11:57.099
I... couldn't sleep.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.801
What, so you came up to the jumper bay?

11:59.836 --> 12:02.468
Yeah... I thought I'd go for a ride.

12:02.503 --> 12:04.899
In a puddle jumper?

12:04.934 --> 12:06.532
Is there a problem with that?

12:06.567 --> 12:08.500
A few. for starters, you don't
have the ancient gene,

12:08.535 --> 12:09.465
So you can't fly one.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.500
But you already know that.

12:10.535 --> 12:11.932
Can you fly it?

12:11.967 --> 12:13.184
Of course I can, but that's not the point.

12:13.219 --> 12:14.401
Look, you should be back in the infirmary.

12:14.436 --> 12:16.101
But you could take me for a ride.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.132
What, now?

12:17.167 --> 12:19.366
Yeah. it would really help me relax.

12:19.401 --> 12:21.134
Well, I thought Beckett
gave you pills for that?

12:21.169 --> 12:23.334
They didn't work.

12:24.067 --> 12:27.167
Yeah. come on. please?

12:27.202 --> 12:28.301
Just you and me.

12:29.567 --> 12:31.465
Alone...

12:31.500 --> 12:33.700
Oh, you could take me somewhere secluded.

12:33.735 --> 12:36.600
We can... we could make love...

12:36.635 --> 12:38.867
Underneath the stars.

12:38.902 --> 12:40.099
Really?

12:40.134 --> 12:41.734
Would you like that?

12:41.769 --> 12:43.199
Well... yeah!

12:43.234 --> 12:44.867
I mean, I'd have to get a blanket, though,

12:44.902 --> 12:46.001
Because the mainland's groundcover

12:46.036 --> 12:47.351
Is loaded with allergens.

12:47.386 --> 12:48.632
No. let's just go now.

12:48.667 --> 12:49.800
Wait. w-w-wait. no, no, no, no.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.066
Look, you look.

12:51.101 --> 12:52.800
You should go back to the infirmary.

12:52.835 --> 12:54.167
Forget about the infirmary.

12:54.202 --> 12:55.600
I need to be with you.

12:55.635 --> 12:56.966
Jennifer, please.

12:57.001 --> 12:58.767
Come on. just a quick ride.

12:58.802 --> 13:00.533
Don't you want to be with me?

13:00.568 --> 13:02.066
No. no! no, I just...

13:02.101 --> 13:03.832
Yes! I just... will you stop?

13:03.867 --> 13:05.301
Look, I don't know what's wrong with you,

13:05.336 --> 13:06.632
But you are clearly not yourself.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.201
I'm taking you back to the infirmary...

13:08.236 --> 13:09.433
No.

13:09.468 --> 13:10.667
Well, you can argue all you want,

13:10.702 --> 13:12.132
I'm not letting you...

13:12.167 --> 13:13.799
You're not taking me anywhere.

13:13.834 --> 13:17.500
Jennifer... I need you to listen to me.

13:17.535 --> 13:18.399
As soon as you are cured

13:18.434 --> 13:20.800
Of whatever it is that is affecting you,

13:20.835 --> 13:22.434
You're going to thank me for this,

13:23.970 --> 13:25.401
No! don't you...

13:27.700 --> 13:29.232
What're you doing?

13:29.267 --> 13:32.167
You should've taken me on that ride.

13:50.144 --> 13:52.043
I don't care what the scans say...

13:52.078 --> 13:54.476
Either she's suffered

13:54.511 --> 13:56.709
A serious mind-altering brain trauma,

13:56.744 --> 14:00.043
Or some kind of entity
has taken control of her.

14:00.078 --> 14:01.377
Has she been injured recently?

14:01.412 --> 14:02.275
Not that I know of.

14:02.310 --> 14:04.011
I mean, she was perfectly
fine up until yesterday.

14:04.046 --> 14:04.976
I'm telling you,

14:05.011 --> 14:05.744
Her brain scan would have revealed

14:05.779 --> 14:07.311
Any kind of physical trauma,

14:07.346 --> 14:08.809
As well as any foreign organism.

14:08.844 --> 14:10.860
Unless the organism's good at hiding.

14:10.895 --> 14:12.842
Yeah. wouldn't be the first time.

14:12.877 --> 14:15.027
It took days to figure out
Rodney was infected.

14:15.062 --> 14:17.369
I still don't think that we should rule out

14:17.404 --> 14:19.677
The possibility of a psychological event.

14:19.712 --> 14:20.843
We sometimes forget that working

14:20.878 --> 14:22.777
In this environment, in
a whole other galaxy,

14:22.812 --> 14:24.642
Can be emotionally overwhelming.

14:24.677 --> 14:26.344
Such acute stress has often been linked

14:26.379 --> 14:27.961
To various dissociative disorders.

14:27.996 --> 14:29.253
Disorder? she tried to kill me.

14:29.288 --> 14:30.476
Look, Rodney, I don't think

14:30.511 --> 14:31.794
She would have pulled the trigger.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.077
Hey, I saw the look in her eyes.

14:33.112 --> 14:35.542
She... wait a second.

14:35.577 --> 14:37.043
What if she had something
to do with Zelenka?

14:37.078 --> 14:38.711
What if she's the one who stabbed him?

14:38.746 --> 14:40.008
Dr. Keller?

14:40.043 --> 14:42.444
That woman down there
is not Jennifer Keller.

14:42.479 --> 14:44.242
I think woolsey's right.

14:44.277 --> 14:46.344
Something has taken control of her.

14:46.379 --> 14:47.843
How can we be sure of this?

14:47.878 --> 14:51.644
Well, we can start by asking her.

15:08.077 --> 15:10.444
Let's make this simple.

15:10.479 --> 15:12.811
Who the hell are you?

15:12.846 --> 15:13.908
What?

15:13.943 --> 15:16.126
If you are, in fact, Jennifer Keller,

15:16.161 --> 15:18.310
You would know what town you're from,

15:18.345 --> 15:20.244
What your father's name is.

15:20.279 --> 15:21.995
So go ahead, tell us.

15:22.030 --> 15:23.676
All right, look...

15:23.711 --> 15:25.644
I know I've been acting strange...

15:25.679 --> 15:27.042
Strange?

15:27.077 --> 15:29.310
Dr. Keller wouldn't point a gun at me.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.544
And she certainly wouldn't stab Zelenka.

15:36.077 --> 15:38.411
You did it, didn't you?

15:38.446 --> 15:40.110
You stabbed him.

15:46.110 --> 15:47.843
It was self-defense.

15:47.878 --> 15:49.511
I didn't want to hurt anybody,

15:49.546 --> 15:50.328
But he attacked me.

15:50.363 --> 15:51.520
Zelenka attacked you?

15:51.555 --> 15:53.166
He couldn't harm a fly.

15:53.201 --> 15:54.743
He tried to grab me.

15:54.778 --> 15:55.977
I thought he was going to turn me in.
?

15:56.012 --> 15:57.078
I was afraid of being caught.

15:57.113 --> 15:58.144
The fact of the matter is,

15:58.179 --> 15:59.228
You have been caught.

15:59.263 --> 16:00.837
So I would advise you

16:00.872 --> 16:02.411
To tell us exactly who...

16:02.446 --> 16:04.577
Or what you are.

16:10.910 --> 16:13.542
My name is Neeva casol.

16:13.577 --> 16:15.209
I have no idea what I'm doing here,

16:15.244 --> 16:18.943
Or how I came to be in this person's body.

16:20.811 --> 16:22.642
In her body?

16:22.677 --> 16:24.509
Yes. one moment I was myself,

16:24.544 --> 16:26.878
Searching through some
artifacts in a village,

16:26.913 --> 16:28.275
The next moment,

16:28.310 --> 16:30.160
I'm stuck in some strange woman's body,

16:30.195 --> 16:32.010
Standing in the middle of this city.

16:32.045 --> 16:33.209
Every time I look

16:33.244 --> 16:35.411
At my reflection, I see her...

16:35.446 --> 16:37.776
Staring back at me.

16:37.811 --> 16:40.210
How is that even possible?

16:40.245 --> 16:41.944
I wish I knew.

16:41.979 --> 16:43.609
What artifacts?

16:43.644 --> 16:46.042
Me and my associates,

16:46.077 --> 16:48.244
We travel around, planet to planet,

16:48.279 --> 16:50.411
Searching for valuables to acquire.

16:50.446 --> 16:52.278
Oh, you mean "steal. "

16:52.313 --> 16:54.075
We heard about a planet

16:54.110 --> 16:57.893
That supposedly held a trove
of ancestral artifacts...

16:57.928 --> 17:01.677
So we made our way there
and broke into the vault...

17:16.042 --> 17:17.576
You see? I told you.

17:17.611 --> 17:21.277
There is all kinds of treasure in here.

17:21.311 --> 17:22.709
Okay, well, move fast.

17:22.743 --> 17:24.743
Take only what we can carry.

17:34.310 --> 17:35.760
What... is that?

17:35.795 --> 17:37.210
I don't know.

17:39.310 --> 17:42.444
But it's too big to haul out of here.

18:19.511 --> 18:23.409
I have no idea how this happened, or why.

18:23.444 --> 18:27.411
Believe me, I'm just as
confused by it as you are...

18:27.446 --> 18:30.175
But I am telling you the truth.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.043
Look, I'm sorry for hurting
one of your people,

18:33.078 --> 18:34.676
But I felt threatened,

18:34.711 --> 18:37.544
And I only know of one
way to deal with a threat.

18:37.579 --> 18:39.242
I don't want to hurt anybody else.

18:39.277 --> 18:43.910
I just... I just want to get
back into my own body.

18:44.977 --> 18:46.275
What have you got?

18:46.310 --> 18:48.277
Well, I think I've figured out
what happened.

18:48.312 --> 18:49.875
The artifact that woman described

18:49.910 --> 18:52.344
It rang a bell, so I did a little research.

18:52.379 --> 18:53.843
Turns out, a few years ago,

18:53.878 --> 18:55.511
Sg-1 encountered a similar device

18:55.546 --> 18:57.142
In the glastonbury cavern.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.910
The ancient communication terminal?

18:58.945 --> 18:59.975
Exactly.

19:00.010 --> 19:02.878
Of course. the stones, the psychic link...

19:02.913 --> 19:04.677
What terminal? what stones?

19:05.043 --> 19:07.310
ok,look. Sg-1 discovered an ancient device.

19:07.345 --> 19:08.477
These stones... if you place them

19:08.512 --> 19:09.743
In one of several recesses

19:09.778 --> 19:11.244
Around the outside of the device,

19:12.844 --> 19:15.310
And allows you to connect
to someone far... far away,

19:15.345 --> 19:17.161
Across the galaxy, intergalactically, even,

19:17.196 --> 19:19.037
As was the case with
Daniel Jackson and Vala.

19:19.072 --> 19:20.878
So this woman activated
one of these devices?

19:20.913 --> 19:22.376
I think so, yes.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.977
Why'd she connect with Keller?

19:24.012 --> 19:25.778
Ah, my first question as well.

19:25.813 --> 19:27.544
Then I remembered janus's lab...

19:27.579 --> 19:29.776
We have recovered tons

19:29.811 --> 19:31.576
Of ancient technology from there.

19:31.611 --> 19:33.277
We're still in the process
of cataloguing it all.

19:33.312 --> 19:34.875
Anyways, a few weeks ago,

19:34.910 --> 19:37.310
Jennifer visited me while
I was working there.

19:37.345 --> 19:38.611
Rodney, if we don't leave soon,

19:38.646 --> 19:39.878
We're not going to get a good seat.

19:39.913 --> 19:41.110
Yeah. almost... almost there.

19:41.145 --> 19:42.444
Come on, it's dr. no!

19:42.479 --> 19:43.709
The first bond movie.

19:43.744 --> 19:44.977
You don't want to get stuck

19:45.012 --> 19:46.210
Sitting behind Ronon again,

19:46.245 --> 19:47.175
Like last week.

19:47.210 --> 19:48.509
I know, I know, I know.

19:48.544 --> 19:50.511
Not to mention, all the
popcorn's gonna be gone.

19:50.546 --> 19:51.676
God! this is amazing!

19:51.711 --> 19:53.010
These are the initial design concepts

19:53.045 --> 19:54.042
For a personal cloaking device.

19:54.077 --> 19:55.676
Janus never got around to making it,

19:55.711 --> 19:58.110
But I think, given enough
time, I might be able...

19:59.844 --> 20:01.611
We haven't cataloged those yet!

20:01.646 --> 20:03.142
Sorry.

20:03.177 --> 20:04.476
What did we say about that?

20:04.511 --> 20:06.777
These stones must somehow be connected

20:06.812 --> 20:09.008
To the ancient terminal that Neeva found.

20:09.043 --> 20:11.711
But how could Jennifer activate
one of these stones?

20:11.746 --> 20:13.478
He's right, it's ancient technology.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.095
Don't you need to have the a. t. a. gene?

20:15.130 --> 20:16.753
Well, it must've been initialized already.

20:16.788 --> 20:18.377
Maybe janus did it thousands of years ago,

20:18.412 --> 20:19.944
Or maybe a tech initialized it

20:19.979 --> 20:21.478
After we discovered the lab.

20:21.513 --> 20:22.942
Look, the point is that Jennifer

20:22.977 --> 20:24.644
Was obviously the last person to touch this,

20:24.679 --> 20:25.975
Which is why it connected to her.

20:26.010 --> 20:28.577
If I remember the case report correctly,

20:28.612 --> 20:31.109
Disconnecting the device proved difficult.

20:31.144 --> 20:33.210
Yes. I've been going over
the SGC files on that,

20:33.245 --> 20:35.277
And there's still a lot of
unanswered questions

20:35.312 --> 20:36.611
About how it works.

20:36.646 --> 20:37.875
Hold on.

20:37.910 --> 20:40.693
If this woman's mind is in Keller's body,

20:40.728 --> 20:43.477
Does that mean Keller's mind is in her body?

20:43.512 --> 20:44.409
I don't know.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.810
Maybe. I mean... probably.

20:46.845 --> 20:49.561
Then the question is...

20:49.596 --> 20:52.277
Where is dr. Keller?

21:03.477 --> 21:05.344
Did you contact Atlantis?

21:05.379 --> 21:06.342
No.

21:06.377 --> 21:07.843
Why not?

21:07.878 --> 21:10.711
I chose to first contact a few
of my trading partners

21:10.746 --> 21:11.809
On other planets.

21:11.844 --> 21:13.476
It appears you and your accomplices

21:13.511 --> 21:15.142
Have made quite the name for yourselves.

21:15.177 --> 21:17.943
I already told you, I am not
who you think I am...

21:17.978 --> 21:19.908
I suppose I should feel fortunate.

21:19.943 --> 21:22.175
I mean, your crimes elsewhere far exceed

21:22.210 --> 21:24.444
The mere robbery charges
you've been accused of here.

21:24.479 --> 21:27.609
I've counted no less than five murders

21:27.644 --> 21:29.944
Committed on other planets
by your hand alone.

21:29.979 --> 21:32.244
Several more with the aid
of your two accomplices.

21:32.279 --> 21:34.977
Well, they may have eluded capture so far,

21:35.012 --> 21:36.477
But mark my words, we will find them.

21:36.512 --> 21:37.342
Listen to me.

21:37.377 --> 21:39.842
My name is dr. Jennifer Keller.

21:39.877 --> 21:42.611
I am the chief medical
officer from Atlantis.

21:42.646 --> 21:44.476
I don't know what's going on,

21:44.511 --> 21:46.743
Or how my mind ended
up in this woman's body,

21:46.778 --> 21:49.828
But if you contact them,
ask for dr. Rodney McKay...

21:49.863 --> 21:52.878
You are also said to be
a highly effective liar,

21:52.913 --> 21:54.110
Willing to fabricate any story,

21:54.145 --> 21:55.994
Broker any kind of deal,

21:56.029 --> 21:57.844
To get yourself free.

21:57.879 --> 21:59.376
Rest assured,

21:59.411 --> 22:01.360
I will not fall for your tricks.

22:01.395 --> 22:03.275
As magistrate of this village,

22:03.310 --> 22:04.760
I hereby pronounce sentence upon you

22:04.795 --> 22:06.210
For the crimes you've committed,

22:06.245 --> 22:07.676
Not only on this planet,

22:07.711 --> 22:10.744
But on all the other
planets in the coalition.

22:10.779 --> 22:12.342
Tomorrow,

22:12.377 --> 22:14.043
You shall be taken from this cell

22:14.078 --> 22:15.577
And executed.

22:22.021 --> 22:23.254
What are the options?

22:23.289 --> 22:24.404
There's only one option.

22:24.439 --> 22:25.485
We have to go to the planet,

22:25.520 --> 22:26.520
Find the communications terminal,

22:26.555 --> 22:28.119
And shut it off.

22:28.154 --> 22:29.620
It was activated on that end.
It's the initial transmitter.

22:29.655 --> 22:30.904
The only way to sever the connection

22:30.939 --> 22:32.119
Is to shut it down at the source.

22:32.154 --> 22:33.921
And have you figured out
how to safely do that?

22:33.956 --> 22:36.052
No, not yet.

22:36.087 --> 22:37.253
We're not going to know

22:37.288 --> 22:38.654
Until we get a look at this thing.

22:38.689 --> 22:40.152
Well, the sooner, the better.

22:40.187 --> 22:41.952
I've been studying the SG-1 report.

22:41.987 --> 22:45.021
This device connects beyond
merely the psychological.

22:45.056 --> 22:47.620
There's also a physiological
connection as well.

22:47.655 --> 22:48.752
What does that mean?

22:48.787 --> 22:51.954
It means, should Neeva's body be killed,

22:51.989 --> 22:55.121
Jennifer's mind would perish along with her.

22:55.156 --> 22:56.518
A?d we'll be stuck with...

22:56.553 --> 22:58.453
This other woman in Keller's body?

22:58.488 --> 22:59.787
We need to get moving.

22:59.822 --> 23:00.819
Agreed.

23:00.854 --> 23:02.620
Do we know which planet this device is on?

23:02.655 --> 23:03.986
We will.

23:04.021 --> 23:05.770
I would be happy to take you to the planet.

23:05.805 --> 23:07.520
I'll lead you straight to the device...

23:07.555 --> 23:08.819
On one condition.

23:08.854 --> 23:10.987
You're in no position to make any demands...

23:11.022 --> 23:12.485
What is it?

23:12.520 --> 23:13.785
When you sever that connection,

23:13.820 --> 23:15.987
You have to agree not to
pursue me or my accomplices.

23:16.022 --> 23:17.518
Fine.

23:17.553 --> 23:19.520
And I want you to give me
one of those puddle jumpers.

23:19.555 --> 23:21.152
What? forget it!

23:21.187 --> 23:23.487
I know how many you have.
You have more than enough.

23:23.522 --> 23:24.887
You're not getting anything.

23:24.922 --> 23:26.219
Weapons, then.

23:26.254 --> 23:28.321
You take us to the planet,
we agree not to pursue you.

23:28.356 --> 23:30.321
That's it. take it or leave it.

23:32.054 --> 23:34.154
All right, all right. let's go.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.653
Which way?

23:54.688 --> 23:56.552
This way.

23:56.587 --> 23:58.620
It's not far. a few hours' walk.

23:58.655 --> 23:59.585
A few hours?

23:59.620 --> 24:01.652
You could have told us that before!

24:01.687 --> 24:03.454
Wouldn't have made any difference, Rodney.

24:03.489 --> 24:05.221
We couldn't get a jumper into this forest.

24:05.256 --> 24:07.787
And the daedalus is back on earth.

24:07.822 --> 24:09.952
Yeah, but I could've packed

24:09.987 --> 24:11.870
Some extra power bars, some water,

24:11.905 --> 24:13.754
Not to mention proper insoles.

24:13.789 --> 24:14.921
He complains a lot.

24:14.956 --> 24:16.019
Only when he's awake.

24:16.054 --> 24:18.754
Is it true that dr. Keller and he are...

24:18.789 --> 24:21.488
Hard to believe, huh?

24:21.523 --> 24:24.187
Yeah, keep walkin'.

24:30.354 --> 24:32.887
It's time.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.119
That's it.

24:50.154 --> 24:51.353
The vault containing the artifacts

24:51.388 --> 24:52.553
Is near the center of the village,

24:52.588 --> 24:53.919
So we'll have to be quiet.

24:53.954 --> 24:56.321
Maybe only a few of us should go in.

24:56.356 --> 24:57.587
And I'm going to need a weapon,

24:57.622 --> 24:58.685
In case we run into some...

24:58.720 --> 25:00.487
No. we're not breaking into the room.

25:00.522 --> 25:01.485
What?

25:01.520 --> 25:03.087
We're going to go talk to these people

25:03.122 --> 25:04.385
And ask them for help.

25:04.420 --> 25:05.154
Oh, they're not going to help us.

25:05.189 --> 25:06.588
I tried to rob them.

25:06.623 --> 25:07.952
They won't know you.

25:07.987 --> 25:09.820
You're in Jennifer Keller's body, remember?

25:09.855 --> 25:11.271
If you do not say anything,

25:11.306 --> 25:12.652
It should not be a problem.

25:12.687 --> 25:14.620
Okay, but what if they've
captured her... me?

25:14.655 --> 25:16.019
Once we sever the connection,

25:16.054 --> 25:18.121
What's to stop them from
keeping me locked up?

25:18.156 --> 25:19.588
Hmm... nothing.

25:21.021 --> 25:22.204
You said we couldn't pursue you.

25:22.239 --> 25:23.388
Didn't say anything about them.

25:23.423 --> 25:24.385
So you tricked me.

25:24.420 --> 25:25.819
Hey, just take it easy.

25:25.854 --> 25:27.253
I won't let you disarm this device

25:27.288 --> 25:29.420
Without first knowing where my body is.

25:29.455 --> 25:31.219
You don't have a choice.

25:31.254 --> 25:32.620
We're wasting valuable time here, people.

25:32.655 --> 25:33.687
Maybe she should stay here.

25:33.722 --> 25:36.687
No. I'll go.

25:36.722 --> 25:37.919
Ronon?

25:37.954 --> 25:39.720
Yeah, I got her.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.520
Let's go.

25:48.954 --> 25:50.785
Hi.

25:50.820 --> 25:51.986
It's OK, we're friends.

25:52.021 --> 25:53.787
We're, uh, we're from Atlantis.

25:53.822 --> 25:55.687
I'm colonel John Sheppard.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.385
What is it you want?

25:57.420 --> 26:00.453
Well, we have a problem,
and we need some help.

26:00.488 --> 26:02.071
We hear that this village holds

26:02.106 --> 26:03.619
A number of ancient artifacts,

26:03.654 --> 26:04.720
Most notably a communication terminal...

26:04.755 --> 26:06.554
About yea-big, round-ish,

26:06.589 --> 26:08.354
Grooves along the outside...

26:08.389 --> 26:09.852
Yes?

26:09.887 --> 26:13.054
Why do you ask about this device?

26:13.089 --> 26:14.888
So you have it? where is it?

26:14.923 --> 26:16.652
It's hidden, and well-protected,

26:16.687 --> 26:18.687
So if you have any designs on removing it...

26:18.722 --> 26:19.986
No, no, no, no, no. look.

26:20.021 --> 26:21.585
We just want to take a look at it.

26:21.620 --> 26:24.054
We think it may have become
inadvertently activated.

26:24.089 --> 26:25.754
And it's... well, it's causing
some problems

26:25.789 --> 26:27.138
For us on Atlantis.

26:27.173 --> 26:28.452
Long story short,

26:28.487 --> 26:31.321
We're just going to shut it off,
and, well, we'll be on our way.

26:31.356 --> 26:32.487
We're not here to cause any trouble.

26:32.522 --> 26:34.619
We'd just like some assistance.

26:34.654 --> 26:37.319
I do not have the authority
to grant such assistance.

26:37.354 --> 26:40.321
For that, you will need to speak
to the village magistrate.

26:40.356 --> 26:42.921
All right. let's, uh, let's talk to him.

26:42.956 --> 26:43.719
He's not here.

26:43.754 --> 26:44.886
Oh, for god's sake.

26:44.921 --> 26:47.337
How long's he going to be gone?
This is urgent.

26:47.372 --> 26:49.754
He will return when the
execution is completed.

27:03.087 --> 27:05.254
Oh, my god!

27:12.754 --> 27:15.186
Neeva casol...

27:15.221 --> 27:18.787
You have been found guilty
of the crime of murder,

27:18.822 --> 27:20.720
And so you shall be put to death.

27:20.755 --> 27:23.321
I am not Neeva casol!

27:32.954 --> 27:34.319
Don't worry.

27:34.354 --> 27:37.720
The executioner is strong, his blade sharp.

27:37.755 --> 27:40.054
Your death will be far less painful

27:40.089 --> 27:42.286
Than those of your victims.

27:42.321 --> 27:45.553
Please... please! don't do this!

28:05.854 --> 28:07.420
Ambush!

28:44.654 --> 28:46.685
What?

28:46.720 --> 28:50.620
No thank-you for the rescue?

28:50.655 --> 28:52.620
Let's go.

28:57.423 --> 28:58.754
Find her!

28:59.987 --> 29:03.054
Go back to the village, gather more men.

29:03.089 --> 29:06.054
I want that ancestral ring guarded!

29:06.089 --> 29:09.720
No one leaves this planet!

29:18.087 --> 29:20.288
I don't believe this. how did she escape?

29:20.323 --> 29:22.253
My accomplices no doubt intervened.

29:22.288 --> 29:24.388
This is not the first time
we've been in this situation.

29:24.423 --> 29:25.654
How many accomplices do you have?

29:25.689 --> 29:26.452
Two.

29:26.487 --> 29:27.685
That's all?

29:27.720 --> 29:28.652
More than enough. trust me.

29:28.687 --> 29:30.120
You don't want to challenge them.

29:30.155 --> 29:31.771
Yeah? we'll see about that.

29:31.806 --> 29:33.387
Where would they have gone?

29:33.422 --> 29:35.352
I have no idea.

29:35.387 --> 29:37.654
All right, chewie. start trackin'.

29:37.689 --> 29:38.788
Yeah. I'm on it.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.885
You looked frightened out there.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.421
What, you didn't think we'd save you?

29:53.456 --> 29:54.786
What, that... no, I just...

29:54.821 --> 29:56.987
After how many times you saved our hides?

29:57.022 --> 29:59.053
We weren't going to let you down.

30:01.287 --> 30:03.337
You all right?

30:03.372 --> 30:05.196
You look confused.

30:05.231 --> 30:06.985
No, I'm just...

30:07.020 --> 30:09.987
You know, happy to be out of there.

30:10.022 --> 30:12.087
So, what's the plan?

30:12.122 --> 30:13.471
Plan?

30:13.506 --> 30:14.786
Yeah.

30:14.821 --> 30:17.037
What do we do now?

30:17.072 --> 30:19.254
Uh... I don't know.

30:21.354 --> 30:23.854
Yet. yet... I don't know yet.

30:23.889 --> 30:26.071
I... I just need, um...

30:26.106 --> 30:28.146
More time to think.

30:28.181 --> 30:30.152
Well, think faster.

30:30.187 --> 30:31.652
Because, sooner or later,

30:31.687 --> 30:34.270
Those villagers are going to find this cave.

30:34.305 --> 30:36.854
And I don't want to be here when they do.

30:36.889 --> 30:38.719
Right.

30:38.754 --> 30:41.287
Good point.

30:45.287 --> 30:48.287
This way.

30:57.387 --> 30:59.452
That's the third patrol
in the last 10 minutes.

30:59.487 --> 31:01.821
It seems as if the entire village
is out looking for her.

31:01.856 --> 31:05.154
Let's hope we find her before they do.

31:29.920 --> 31:32.521
What the hell happened?

31:32.556 --> 31:34.619
I lost her.

31:34.654 --> 31:37.037
Are there no tracks?

31:37.072 --> 31:39.421
There's nothing.

31:39.456 --> 31:41.087
She's good.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.920
Listen, I think the best plan of action

31:44.955 --> 31:46.853
Is to leave this planet.

31:46.888 --> 31:48.254
Now, I know of another planet.

31:48.289 --> 31:49.519
We'll be safe there.

31:49.554 --> 31:50.854
They'll be guarding the ring.

31:50.889 --> 31:52.252
I know.

31:52.287 --> 31:56.320
Maybe we could create
some kind of diversion?

31:57.721 --> 32:00.120
Well, how do we do that?

32:00.155 --> 32:03.053
I don't know. um...

32:03.088 --> 32:04.252
Maybe...

32:04.287 --> 32:07.185
Maybe we can set an explosion.

32:07.220 --> 32:09.654
And why would they run toward an explosion?

32:09.689 --> 32:12.320
Or someth?ng else.

32:13.987 --> 32:16.254
I say we wait till nightfall...

32:17.320 --> 32:19.888
...then we'll launch an attack on the ring.

32:19.923 --> 32:21.487
Catch them by surprise.

32:21.522 --> 32:22.753
Uh, an attack?

32:22.788 --> 32:23.985
We'll kill the guards,

32:24.020 --> 32:27.454
Activate the ring, and we make our escape.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.720
I agree.

32:29.755 --> 32:31.085
Okay. uh...

32:31.120 --> 32:33.487
But if I think of something
else before then,

32:33.522 --> 32:34.554
Maybe we could...

32:42.154 --> 32:43.654
All right, don't shoot.

32:43.689 --> 32:46.654
Who... are... you?

32:48.154 --> 32:51.320
I'm... Neeva casol.

32:52.354 --> 32:54.554
All right, let me explain.

32:54.589 --> 32:56.638
Back at the artifact vault,

32:56.673 --> 32:58.653
I accidentally activated

32:58.688 --> 33:01.319
Some kind of ancestral communications device

33:01.354 --> 33:04.587
That caused my mind to transfer
into this woman's body,

33:04.622 --> 33:06.687
And hers into mine.

33:07.687 --> 33:09.854
You expect us to believe that?

33:09.889 --> 33:11.319
Yeah, jannik, I do.

33:11.354 --> 33:14.087
I expect you to believe that,
just as you did on vara sol,

33:14.122 --> 33:15.487
When I brokered that deal
with the fish merchant

33:15.522 --> 33:16.520
To save your life.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.152
And you, bordal.

33:20.187 --> 33:21.619
If you didn't trust me

33:21.654 --> 33:23.788
Back when you got caught at that brothel,

33:23.823 --> 33:25.085
Those women would've made sure

33:25.120 --> 33:27.587
The thought of procreating never
again entered your mind.

33:27.622 --> 33:28.754
How do you know about that?

33:28.789 --> 33:30.052
Because I'm Neeva.

33:30.087 --> 33:32.370
There's a link between this woman and me.

33:32.405 --> 33:34.654
Her mind is in my body, and mine is in hers.

33:36.788 --> 33:38.270
Look, whatever's happening here,

33:38.305 --> 33:39.553
I had nothing to do with it.

33:39.588 --> 33:40.519
No, she didn't.

33:40.554 --> 33:43.087
But if we're going to fix this,
we need to move fast.

33:43.122 --> 33:44.619
We need to go back to the village,

33:44.654 --> 33:46.987
Break into the vault,
and turn off that device.

33:47.022 --> 33:48.353
We need to be really careful,

33:48.388 --> 33:50.388
Because not only are the
villagers out looking for us,

33:50.423 --> 33:52.120
But so are the people from Atlantis.

33:52.220 --> 33:53.521
W-w-wait a second. they're here?

33:53.556 --> 33:55.185
Who, colonel Sheppard?

33:55.220 --> 33:57.387
Among others, but they'll
turn us in to the villagers

33:57.422 --> 33:58.519
If they catch us,

33:58.554 --> 33:59.953
So we need no problems from you.

33:59.988 --> 34:02.519
Do you understand me?

34:02.554 --> 34:05.487
All right, we need to find this device...

34:05.522 --> 34:07.187
Stop!

34:08.920 --> 34:11.187
I don't know what's going on here.

34:11.222 --> 34:12.487
I just told you, all right?

34:12.522 --> 34:13.319
I am Neeva.

34:13.353 --> 34:14.786
I've never seen you before!

34:14.822 --> 34:15.853
Jannik, listen to me.

34:15.888 --> 34:18.071
This is not the time to be stupid.

34:18.106 --> 34:19.862
Uh, I wouldn't make him angry...

34:19.898 --> 34:21.386
You're going to put down the gun,
71?
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:22,720
And you're going to
listen to what I say.

34:22.755 --> 34:24.152
No. I'm not.

34:24.187 --> 34:27.320
I'm going to take the both of you with me.

34:27.355 --> 34:30.152
We're going to attack the ring now.

34:30.187 --> 34:33.888
And we'll sort out who's really
who on another planet.

34:34.521 --> 34:38.353
And if you're lying to me,
you're as good as dead.

34:45.320 --> 34:46.737
This dr. McKay...

34:46.772 --> 34:47.963
What about him?

34:47.998 --> 34:49.154
You can do better.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.587
Be quiet.

34:52.286 --> 34:54.303
Jannik, I know this is
difficult to understand...

34:54.338 --> 34:56.320
I was equally confused
by it at the beginning,

34:56.355 --> 34:57.320
But you have to...

35:04.554 --> 35:05.920
How many?

35:05.955 --> 35:07.388
I don't know!

35:07.423 --> 35:08.821
I count four.

35:10.854 --> 35:13.587
We'd be a lot better off
if you'd given us weapons.

35:20.487 --> 35:22.320
He's dead.

35:36.654 --> 35:38.888
Hey! come back here!

35:40.154 --> 35:41.285
Stop!

35:41.320 --> 35:42.953
Jannik, don't! don't!

36:13.187 --> 36:15.319
Is she going to be all right?

36:15.354 --> 36:17.387
Aye, for now, but I need
to stop the bleeding.

36:17.422 --> 36:18.454
Here, hold her steady, Rodney.

36:30.498 --> 36:32.264
You two, give us a hand here, please.

36:33.264 --> 36:34.129
On the table, Rodney.

36:34.164 --> 36:35.730
These are the people from Atlantis

36:35.765 --> 36:36.663
I was telling you about.

36:36.698 --> 36:37.695
What happened?

36:37.730 --> 36:38.897
She was shot by one of your men.

36:38.932 --> 36:40.262
I warned you

36:40.297 --> 36:41.830
It was dangerous to venture out there.

36:41.865 --> 36:42.795
What, is she dead?

36:42.830 --> 36:44.063
No, but she's badly wounded.

36:44.098 --> 36:45.262
Teyla, going to need a hand.

36:45.297 --> 36:46.930
I need to remove the bullet
and stop the bleeding.

36:46.965 --> 36:48.564
And we need access to that
communication terminal.

36:48.599 --> 36:49.864
We need to shut it down right now!

36:49.899 --> 36:50.728
Why? what's it doing?

36:50.763 --> 36:52.763
Well, simply put, it creates a psychic
link between two people.

36:52.798 --> 36:55.097
So dr. Keller and this Neeva casol

36:55.132 --> 36:55.962
Have switched places.

36:55.997 --> 36:57.330
They're in each other's bodies.

36:57.365 --> 36:58.663
You know about Atlantis, right?

36:58.698 --> 36:59.762
Yes.

36:59.797 --> 37:00.947
Then you know you're better off

37:00.982 --> 37:02.306
Being our friend than our enemy.

37:02.341 --> 37:03.595
So why don't you be our friend

37:03.630 --> 37:06.331
And show us where that terminal is?

37:09.630 --> 37:10.331
This way.

37:25.131 --> 37:26.480
It's still on!

37:26.515 --> 37:27.795
Obviously.

37:27.830 --> 37:29.029
So turn it off.

37:29.064 --> 37:30.196
Well, there's no switches.

37:30.231 --> 37:33.397
But it looks almost identical
to the one SG-1 found.

37:41.331 --> 37:43.930
There's the bullet...

37:45.498 --> 37:48.264
Now to stem the bleeding.

37:53.663 --> 37:56.563
I don't know who you are...

37:56.598 --> 38:00.730
But you are definitely not Neeva.

38:00.765 --> 38:02.895
No, I'm not.

38:02.930 --> 38:04.797
?But I'm not your enemy, either,

38:04.832 --> 38:06.097
And if you'd just let me,

38:06.132 --> 38:07.264
I think I can help...

38:09.064 --> 38:11.630
You're not helping anyone.

38:12.664 --> 38:13.629
Come on! hurry up!

38:13.664 --> 38:14.796
Believe me, I'm trying!

38:14.831 --> 38:16.395
There's no way to access
the control crystal.

38:16.430 --> 38:18.430
There doesn't seem to be a
way to shut this thing off!

38:18.465 --> 38:21.131
All right. what if... what if we blow it up?

38:21.166 --> 38:22.829
Well, I don't know. I mean, maybe.

38:22.864 --> 38:25.731
I'm just not sure if the
explosion could cause

38:25.766 --> 38:26.696
A sudden power surge...

38:26.731 --> 38:28.131
What the hell'd the other guys do?

38:28.166 --> 38:29.595
Well, SG-1, dialed the gate,

38:29.630 --> 38:31.195
And tossed the device into the vortex

38:31.230 --> 38:33.330
Of the forming wormhole...
disintegrated instantly.

38:33.365 --> 38:35.363
But it's too far to carry back to the gate.

38:35.398 --> 38:37.529
You got bordal killed.

38:37.564 --> 38:41.097
And you've almost got me killed.

38:41.132 --> 38:43.665
I'm going to return the favor.

38:43.700 --> 38:46.198
We may not have much of a choice,

38:46.233 --> 38:47.495
So give me a hand with this.

38:47.530 --> 38:49.464
I'm not sure we've got the time...

38:49.499 --> 38:51.014
Hold up.

38:51.049 --> 38:52.530
Move!

39:04.297 --> 39:05.297
Dr. Keller?

39:05.332 --> 39:06.595
Teyla.

39:06.630 --> 39:08.047
You're back?

39:08.082 --> 39:09.464
I'm back.

39:11.263 --> 39:13.762
Shh. you've been shot, love.

39:13.797 --> 39:16.064
Don't worry, we removed the bullet.

39:16.099 --> 39:18.330
You'll be just fine.

39:21.164 --> 39:23.047
Wait, jannik.

39:23.082 --> 39:24.896
It's me, Neeva.

39:24.931 --> 39:27.530
They must've turned off the device.

39:27.565 --> 39:30.597
Nice try.

39:32.530 --> 39:35.363
Jannik, no!

39:39.263 --> 39:40.430
I appreciate that, dana.

39:40.465 --> 39:42.495
Say hello for me.

39:42.530 --> 39:44.228
Well, well, well! what's the occasion?

39:44.263 --> 39:46.397
Oh, just visiting a friend in the infirmary.

39:46.432 --> 39:47.731
That's very thoughtful of you, Rodney.

39:47.766 --> 39:48.996
I know.

39:49.031 --> 39:50.597
Major lorne and his team just returned.

39:50.632 --> 39:52.164
They did a full sweep of the planet.

39:52.199 --> 39:53.929
No sign of Neeva casol.

39:53.964 --> 39:55.564
She must've managed to escape.

39:55.599 --> 39:56.865
I don't know about that.

39:56.900 --> 39:58.096
According to Jennifer,

39:58.131 --> 39:59.714
Her accomplice was just about to kill her

39:59.749 --> 40:01.297
When we shut down the
communication terminal.

40:01.332 --> 40:02.462
Well, either he did kill her

40:02.497 --> 40:03.997
And disposed of the body
before escaping himself,

40:04.032 --> 40:05.697
Or she got away from him somehow.

40:05.732 --> 40:07.363
Well, I guess we'll never know.

40:07.398 --> 40:08.514
Well, we may.

40:08.549 --> 40:09.595
Word has gone out

40:09.630 --> 40:11.297
To several planets in the coalition.

40:11.332 --> 40:12.964
If Neeva is alive and roaming free,

40:12.999 --> 40:15.797
She won't be for long.

40:19.064 --> 40:20.263
You'll promise y?u'll take it easy?

40:20.298 --> 40:21.696
Yes, doctor.

40:21.731 --> 40:23.164
Don't worry. I'll make sure of it.

40:23.199 --> 40:24.181
Hey, you.

40:24.216 --> 40:25.129
Hey, you.

40:25.164 --> 40:26.295
Oh, thank you, Rodney.

40:26.330 --> 40:27.764
Flowers and chocolates? I'm impressed.

40:27.799 --> 40:29.096
Right. enough.

40:29.131 --> 40:30.397
She's all alone in the infirmary.

40:30.432 --> 40:31.664
I just thought I would, you know,

40:31.699 --> 40:33.530
Brighten the room up a bit.

40:34.731 --> 40:36.264
Oh. hey, Radek.

40:36.299 --> 40:38.264
How you doing?

40:38.299 --> 40:40.195
Better. thanks.

40:40.230 --> 40:43.430
Again, Radek, I am so sorry
for what happened.

40:43.465 --> 40:44.897
It's not your fault.

40:44.932 --> 40:46.330
I told you, don't worry.

40:46.365 --> 40:48.063
I'm fine.

40:48.098 --> 40:49.063
Yeah, yeah, of course he's fine.

40:49.098 --> 40:51.664
He's perky, rosy-cheeked,
ready to go back to work.

40:51.699 --> 40:53.629
I don't know about that...

40:53.664 --> 40:56.098
He needs to get rest, too, Rodney.

40:56.133 --> 40:57.096
I agree.

40:57.131 --> 40:59.363
His wound was much more serious than mine.

40:59.398 --> 41:00.764
Really? I mean, you were shot.

41:00.799 --> 41:03.362
He was just... stabbed.

41:03.397 --> 41:06.147
Perhaps I should wheel you to another room?

41:06.182 --> 41:08.897
Just until he's gone, please. thank you.

41:08.932 --> 41:10.914
Aye. right.

41:10.949 --> 41:12.897
Rodney.

41:17.831 --> 41:20.430
I completely agree.

41:24.164 --> 41:25.980
Chocolates?

41:26.015 --> 41:27.762
Thank you.

41:27.797 --> 41:30.997
So... I was thinking that, uh...

41:31.032 --> 41:32.597
When you're feeling better,

41:32.632 --> 41:34.064
We could maybe, um...

41:34.099 --> 41:35.497
You know, go for a ride.

41:35.532 --> 41:36.796
A ride?

41:36.831 --> 41:38.129
Yeah, you know,

41:38.164 --> 41:39.897
Take the puddle jumper, go to the mainland,

41:39.932 --> 41:41.597
Maybe have a picnic, maybe...

41:41.632 --> 41:43.330
Lie out under the stars?

41:45.330 --> 41:47.362
What?

41:47.397 --> 41:48.829
You did turn off

41:48.864 --> 41:50.931
That communication terminal, right?

41:50.966 --> 41:52.430
There's no one else in there?

41:52.465 --> 41:53.796
No, it's really me.

41:53.831 --> 41:55.929
Because a puddle jumper ride...

41:55.964 --> 41:57.897
And the picnic under the stars...

41:57.932 --> 41:59.248
I mean, that's just so...

41:59.283 --> 42:00.564
So not me. right, OK.

42:00.599 --> 42:01.997
No, bad idea.

42:02.032 --> 42:03.464
No...

42:04.897 --> 42:07.297
I think it's a great idea.
