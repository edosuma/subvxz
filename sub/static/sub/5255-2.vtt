00:01.770 --> 00:04.003
<i>Previously on Dominion...</i>

00:04.038 --> 00:06.907
In the war, the entire lower rank of angels

00:06.942 --> 00:08.141
joined Gabriel,

00:08.176 --> 00:10.377
and they couldn't visit
earth without a body.

00:10.412 --> 00:11.679
So they stole ours.

00:11.713 --> 00:14.982
Then came whispers of a chosen child.

00:15.016 --> 00:16.250
You need to speak to your dad.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.418
I'll tell him about us,

00:17.452 --> 00:19.386
and I will get his permission to marry.

00:19.421 --> 00:21.388
- Alex?
- Dad?

00:21.423 --> 00:23.057
You basically left me to die.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.526
Gabriel's massing for another war.

00:25.560 --> 00:29.864
And like Gabriel, some of
them have always hated man.

00:29.898 --> 00:31.665
The powers are far more dangerous

00:31.700 --> 00:32.867
than the angels that possessed mankind

00:32.901 --> 00:34.501
during the extermination.

That's the delegation from Helena.

00:45.981 --> 00:47.181
You think that kid's the one?

00:47.215 --> 00:48.749
The chosen one's a myth.

00:48.783 --> 00:51.085
Helena has the only
air force in the cradle.

00:51.119 --> 00:54.588
The cripple Riesen won't
be an obstacle much longer,

00:54.623 --> 00:56.490
once you've been made Lord of the City.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.826
It is my great pleasure to announce

00:58.860 --> 01:02.663
the engagement of Claire
Riesen to William Whele.

01:02.697 --> 01:04.965
[Cheers and applause]

01:05.000 --> 01:06.800
- [Thud]
- Ooh!

01:06.835 --> 01:08.535
Believe me, David...
we had no part in this.

01:08.570 --> 01:09.637
Round up her entourage.

01:09.671 --> 01:12.506
You are the chosen one.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.910
No one here is gonna breathe
a word of this to anyone

01:15.944 --> 01:17.611
until we've figured out what it all means.

01:17.646 --> 01:20.481
Jeep held the tattoos on his
body for when you are ready.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.249
They will lay out the path

01:22.284 --> 01:24.251
through which mankind can be redeemed

01:24.286 --> 01:26.720
and Gabriel and his legions pushed back.

01:27.722 --> 01:30.591
My son.

01:30.625 --> 01:33.060
We found him.

01:35.830 --> 01:38.265
- Oh.
- [Laughs] Hey.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.702
[Grunts] And he shoots!

01:41.736 --> 01:43.837
Next shot wins the game, hotshot.

01:43.872 --> 01:45.339
I know why you don't bring me here more.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.974
Yeah? Why is that?

01:47.008 --> 01:49.209
'Cause you always lose. [Chuckles]

01:49.244 --> 01:50.411
- Oh.
- Yeah!

01:50.445 --> 01:52.413
Damn! Nice shot.

01:52.447 --> 01:54.448
So what do I owe you?

01:54.482 --> 01:57.518
The jerky, the fuzzy dice, and your Glock.

01:57.552 --> 02:01.121
I'll give you the jerky,
and I'll give you the Glock,

02:01.156 --> 02:03.524
but there's no way I'm giving you my dice!

02:03.558 --> 02:05.159
[Laughs]

02:05.193 --> 02:08.429
[Crows cawing]

02:19.040 --> 02:21.909

03:10.925 --> 03:13.961

03:34.916 --> 03:37.384
You're okay. You're okay.

03:37.419 --> 03:39.887
I thought you left me.

03:43.124 --> 03:45.426
I'll never leave you.

03:45.460 --> 03:47.795
Promise.

03:50.298 --> 03:52.266
We pray that our Brother Jeep

03:52.300 --> 03:55.335
may take safe passage in his journey.

03:55.370 --> 03:58.338
We are comforted by the
words of our founder.

03:58.373 --> 04:01.675
The chosen one is near.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.745
His hope will unite us.

04:04.779 --> 04:08.182
His faith will bolster us.

04:08.216 --> 04:12.886
His strength will bring
us our time of peace.

[Gavel banging, chatter quiets down]

04:30.672 --> 04:32.673
Senator Romero, what's
the status of our reactor?

04:32.707 --> 04:34.475
Using all available resources,

04:34.509 --> 04:37.778
I should have the city back
to full power within days.

04:37.812 --> 04:38.779
Not fast enough.

04:38.813 --> 04:40.147
The walls are barely functioning.

04:40.181 --> 04:41.482
The radar is down.

04:41.516 --> 04:43.417
Our first priority should be defense.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.918
Defense?

04:44.953 --> 04:46.887
From the man who brought
an eight-ball into our city?

04:46.921 --> 04:48.288
You have blood on your hands, Consul.

04:48.323 --> 04:50.157
Your recklessness put us all in danger.

04:50.191 --> 04:53.894
Look, I am the first to admit
I had a lapse in judgment,

04:53.928 --> 04:55.863
but I was doing it for Vega.

04:55.897 --> 04:59.199
Yesterday morning that
eight-ball was discovered

04:59.234 --> 05:01.101
inside our city walls.

05:01.136 --> 05:02.569
And when my men captured it,

05:02.604 --> 05:04.404
my first instinct was to destroy it.

05:04.439 --> 05:07.407
But then I decided that
we could use the eight-ball

05:07.442 --> 05:10.077
to remind Vega of the enemy we face.

05:10.111 --> 05:13.714
Tragically, it backfired,
and for that, I am sorry.

05:13.748 --> 05:16.083
But I was doing it to strengthen the city,

05:16.117 --> 05:17.918
not to endanger it.

05:17.952 --> 05:20.921
The consul decided to teach
us all a lesson in secret.

05:20.955 --> 05:23.223
I call for an audit of House Whele.

05:23.258 --> 05:25.225
- I second that.
- I oppose.

05:25.260 --> 05:27.261
It is a waste of precious
time and resources.

05:27.295 --> 05:29.396
It is not a waste of time! It is necessary!

05:29.430 --> 05:30.397
[Gavel banging]

05:30.431 --> 05:32.833
I agree with Senator Romero.

05:32.867 --> 05:34.935
Consul Whele made a mistake

05:34.969 --> 05:36.904
for which he has been admonished.

05:36.938 --> 05:39.806
Good night, Senators.

05:44.379 --> 05:47.047
May the chosen one save us.

06:28.389 --> 06:31.191
Alex, what are you doing here?

06:31.226 --> 06:33.560
- I need to see Claire.
- It's the middle of the night.

06:33.595 --> 06:35.195
It's none of your business, Noma.

06:35.230 --> 06:36.997
It is now. You're drunk.

06:37.031 --> 06:39.199
- And you're jealous.
- Go home. Sober up.

06:39.234 --> 06:41.235
Noma. Aah!

06:41.269 --> 06:44.538
You're about to end up in the infirmary.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.373
Noma, i-it's fine.

06:46.407 --> 06:49.943
Let him in.

06:53.047 --> 06:54.381
Thanks.

06:55.950 --> 06:57.951
[Door closes]

06:57.986 --> 06:59.286
Let's go.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.622
Alex, I looked for you at the funeral.

07:01.656 --> 07:03.590
Let's do it. Let's go right now.

07:03.625 --> 07:07.027
Let's get out of here. Let's
get out of here right now.

07:07.061 --> 07:10.764
- [Sighs]
- You've been drinking.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.267
We'll be in New Delphi
before you know it, Claire.

07:13.301 --> 07:14.735
Let's just go right now.

07:14.769 --> 07:16.703
Alex, we can't leave.

07:16.738 --> 07:19.239
Yesterday you were
dying to get out of here.

07:19.274 --> 07:21.375
Yesterday I had faith
there was a chosen one.

07:21.409 --> 07:23.810
Today I have proof walking
around in front of me.

07:23.845 --> 07:25.712
Claire, the tattoos aren't proof.

07:25.747 --> 07:27.314
Yes, they are, Alex.

07:27.348 --> 07:29.983
I was in that bunker. We
both heard what Michael said.

07:30.018 --> 07:33.053
You... you are gonna unite
all of us and end this war.

07:33.087 --> 07:34.221
Vega needs you.

07:34.255 --> 07:36.156
What about when I needed Vega, huh?

07:36.190 --> 07:38.692
When I was a V-1, struggling
to survive in the tunnels?

07:38.726 --> 07:41.228
A V-1 who became a soldier
to protect the people.

07:41.262 --> 07:42.329
I became a soldier

07:42.363 --> 07:45.098
so I could get three meals a day!

07:49.370 --> 07:51.038
You're afraid.

07:52.607 --> 07:54.608
- [Sighs] I know it.
- No, Alex.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.744
I have never been afraid a day in my life.

07:57.779 --> 08:01.181
Then come with me,
Claire. Let's go right now.

08:01.215 --> 08:03.317
- No.
- Why?

08:03.351 --> 08:05.819
Because we have just been attacked.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.922
The people are terrified. That's why, Alex!

08:08.956 --> 08:10.424
What do you care? You live in a tower!

08:10.458 --> 08:12.592
You go down to the island every two weeks

08:12.627 --> 08:14.127
and pass out sandwiches.

08:14.162 --> 08:15.796
You're a spoiled princess, Claire.

08:15.830 --> 08:18.732
And you're an ugly drunk.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.101
Yeah.

08:21.135 --> 08:23.203
But at least I'm not a hypocrite.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.005
I'm not a fake.

08:25.039 --> 08:26.873
Are you finished?

08:26.908 --> 08:27.941
Yeah.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.776
Good.

08:29.811 --> 08:32.078
Get out.

08:32.113 --> 08:34.414
Get out now, Alex.

08:37.751 --> 08:42.054
[Door opens, closes]

08:52.233 --> 08:55.068
[Door opens]

08:56.337 --> 08:58.138
Quite a performance.

08:58.172 --> 09:02.075
We both know that eight-ball
was caught outside the city.

09:02.110 --> 09:05.245
The creature's location
was not the salient point.

09:05.279 --> 09:07.814
The salient point is that you screwed up.

09:07.849 --> 09:09.383
Damn it, David.

09:09.417 --> 09:12.219
The only thing bigger
than your bank account

09:12.253 --> 09:13.487
is your ego.

09:13.521 --> 09:15.389
I'll take that as a compliment, General.

09:15.423 --> 09:18.692
[Chuckles]

09:18.726 --> 09:21.895
By the way, thank you for
stepping in this afternoon.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.997
I can't have my slick-haired bureaucrat

09:24.031 --> 09:25.532
in jail, can I?

09:25.566 --> 09:27.000
No, you can't,

09:27.034 --> 09:29.202
because this bureaucrat

09:29.237 --> 09:32.205
keeps every department
in the city running...

09:32.240 --> 09:34.408
some I'm sure you've never even heard of.

09:34.442 --> 09:37.177
Yes. You're very talented.

09:37.211 --> 09:39.746
[Slurps] Hmm.

09:39.781 --> 09:43.183
[Swallows] What can I do for you, Edward?

09:43.217 --> 09:45.585
Vega does not need a
religious fervor to break out

09:45.619 --> 09:47.154
over the chosen one.

09:47.188 --> 09:49.122
The city is too unstable.

09:49.157 --> 09:53.226
My thoughts entirely.

09:53.261 --> 09:56.530
There were other people in that bunker.

09:56.564 --> 09:58.665
The techs.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.467
Yes.

10:00.501 --> 10:03.670
They're being spoken to.

10:10.311 --> 10:12.279
[Buttons beeping]

10:12.313 --> 10:14.281
Consul Whele wants to see you.

10:14.315 --> 10:16.249
- Me?
- Yeah.

10:57.058 --> 11:00.927

lives in the attack on Vega.

11:00.962 --> 11:02.963
[Chuckles]

11:02.997 --> 11:07.534
And Brother Janax, you
ballsy son of a bitch!

11:07.568 --> 11:12.138
We preserve you in amber
until Father returns

11:12.173 --> 11:13.640
and the gates reopen!

11:13.674 --> 11:15.642
All: Yeah!

11:15.676 --> 11:18.311
- We drink!

11:36.163 --> 11:37.964
Enjoy your bodies!

11:37.999 --> 11:39.499
All: Yeah!

12:08.496 --> 12:11.898
There's no shame in surrender, Michael.

12:13.334 --> 12:16.236
That's not why I summoned you.

12:16.270 --> 12:18.305
Why attack now?

12:18.339 --> 12:20.240
You already lost the war.

12:20.274 --> 12:23.176
I only lost a battle.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.245
Didn't Father always teach us not to rest

12:25.279 --> 12:27.013
until our work was done?

12:27.048 --> 12:29.115
He would be ashamed of you.

12:29.150 --> 12:32.185
Well, he's not here, is he?

12:32.219 --> 12:33.820
You know why...

12:33.854 --> 12:37.357
Because he realized that
this creation of his,

12:37.391 --> 12:40.226
his pride and joy, was a failure

12:40.261 --> 12:42.762
of epic proportions.

12:42.797 --> 12:44.664
He couldn't stand the sight of them.

12:44.699 --> 12:47.934
He just didn't have the heart

12:47.969 --> 12:49.502
to wipe them out himself.

12:49.537 --> 12:52.105
Are you that jealous
of Father's attention...

12:52.139 --> 12:54.341
his love for them over his angels?

12:54.375 --> 12:55.742
Over you?

12:58.546 --> 13:01.247
I should finish you right now.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.152
Try.

13:06.187 --> 13:09.723
If the humans knew you
were here talking to me,

13:09.757 --> 13:11.825
they'd kill you themselves.

13:16.597 --> 13:19.065
It doesn't make you angry?

13:19.100 --> 13:21.801
They were given our birthright,

13:21.836 --> 13:24.037
gifted a paradise...

13:24.071 --> 13:28.575
this earth, these bodies.

13:28.609 --> 13:31.077
And what did they do?

13:31.112 --> 13:34.347
They turned the planet into a pit.

13:37.118 --> 13:39.719
When they're gone,

13:39.754 --> 13:42.789
the last of them a bad memory...

13:44.692 --> 13:48.128
Maybe then Father will come back.

13:50.231 --> 13:52.432
You're still nothing more
than a frightened child

13:52.466 --> 13:54.734
lashing out.

13:54.769 --> 13:57.937
Your quarrel is with a father who left you,

13:57.972 --> 13:59.606
not with mankind.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.609
My quarrel is with humans
and anyone foolish enough

14:02.643 --> 14:04.377
to stand with them.

14:04.412 --> 14:08.448
I won't allow you to hurt another soul.

14:08.482 --> 14:10.583
Oh.

14:10.618 --> 14:15.088
The humans don't need you
to protect them, Michael.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.990
They have the chosen one now.

14:35.599 --> 14:37.500
If you hadn't acted like a mud woman,

14:37.534 --> 14:39.669
letting Whele have your body,

14:39.703 --> 14:41.938
maybe you would've noticed
that Roan was an infiltrator.

14:41.972 --> 14:44.240
Maybe we could've stopped him
before he killed a hero of Vega.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.976
I'm still Evelyn's consort.

14:47.010 --> 14:49.145
Remember your place, Coral.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.380
I do, and so should you.

14:51.415 --> 14:55.218
The boy fooled Evelyn, and
she's not easily fooled.

14:55.252 --> 14:58.087
She will not react well to this disgrace.

14:58.122 --> 14:59.589
They've humiliated us.

14:59.623 --> 15:02.158
Maybe so. They might have taken our haikas.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.327
But they'll never learn
the secrets of Helena.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.329
[Keys clanging, lock opens]

15:06.363 --> 15:08.631
Arika.

15:30.154 --> 15:32.488
The first time I met you, I thought,

15:32.523 --> 15:35.158
"Now, there's a woman who
will go far in this world."

15:35.192 --> 15:37.326
Really?

15:37.361 --> 15:38.661
Why is that?

15:38.695 --> 15:40.496
It was back when we still did business

15:40.531 --> 15:42.965
with those New Delphi cretins.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.702
I was bidding against you for fuel.

15:50.374 --> 15:52.942
That Delphi oil man... remember him?

15:52.976 --> 15:56.212
Truly repulsive human being.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.481
I figured you must have slept with him

15:58.515 --> 16:01.484
without blinking an eye...

16:01.518 --> 16:03.786
because you got to go
home with the contracts,

16:03.821 --> 16:07.123
and I returned empty-handed,

16:07.157 --> 16:09.558
but with a newfound respect for your will

16:09.593 --> 16:12.628
to do anything to win.

16:12.663 --> 16:16.065
Then two weeks later, he was found dead,

16:16.099 --> 16:20.903
gutted like a tuna, and
I was even more impressed.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.673
Thank you...

16:23.707 --> 16:27.343
though I had nothing to do with that.

16:27.377 --> 16:30.012
[Chuckles]

16:30.047 --> 16:34.050
I trust you and your handmaidens
are being well treated.

16:34.084 --> 16:36.819
Our haikas were removed.

16:36.854 --> 16:38.955
For us, that's cultural savagery.

16:38.989 --> 16:40.256
My apologies,

16:40.290 --> 16:43.025
but after what happened with the boy,

16:43.060 --> 16:45.595
security is our first priority.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.096
Roan fooled us.

16:47.130 --> 16:49.332
Think of it, David.

16:49.366 --> 16:51.667
Gabriel's responsible
for pushing the human race

16:51.702 --> 16:54.003
to the brink of extinction.

16:54.037 --> 16:55.938
Helena will never side with him.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.507
There are black acolytes in this very city

16:58.542 --> 17:00.877
who secretly worship Gabriel as a God.

17:00.911 --> 17:03.846
Who's to say that Evelyn
is not doing the same thing?

17:03.881 --> 17:06.449
Evelyn believes in the divine feminine.

17:06.483 --> 17:10.953
We have no place for a
male deity like Gabriel.

17:12.990 --> 17:17.492
But you didn't bring me
here to discuss culture.

17:17.527 --> 17:20.396
What do you want?

17:20.430 --> 17:22.999
Helena has the only air force left.

17:23.032 --> 17:24.767
I need it.

17:26.904 --> 17:29.171
Evelyn will never enter
a new war with Gabriel

17:29.206 --> 17:31.007
if Helena isn't threatened.

17:31.041 --> 17:33.676
But I have you.

17:33.710 --> 17:35.978
Tell me what she'll think if her consort

17:36.013 --> 17:38.213
is put to death for treason.

17:39.883 --> 17:42.818
She will mourn me,

17:42.853 --> 17:47.023
and then she will bomb Vega into oblivion.

17:52.729 --> 17:54.330
- Good, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.165
- [Chuckles]
- Reminds me of you...

17:56.199 --> 17:57.733
a bottomless pit.

17:57.768 --> 18:01.037
- Thanks, Felicia.
- [Chuckles]

18:01.071 --> 18:04.340
No, she's teasing. Eat as much as you want.

18:04.374 --> 18:07.610
Good morning.

18:07.644 --> 18:09.512
Felicia, can you take Bixby
to get a glass of milk?

18:09.546 --> 18:11.647
Of course.

18:14.918 --> 18:16.953
Is that the little girl from the bunker?

18:16.987 --> 18:20.156
I said she was under our
protection, and I meant it.

18:22.993 --> 18:25.194
I guess it's old-fashioned
to think a bride

18:25.228 --> 18:27.163
should be the first one to
know about her own wedding.

18:27.197 --> 18:28.631
If I went to you first,

18:28.665 --> 18:30.333
you never would've entertained the idea.

18:30.367 --> 18:33.102
Why would I? I don't love William.

18:33.136 --> 18:35.604
In the world we live in,

18:35.639 --> 18:38.040
we have to think about
more than just ourselves.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.977
So wanting to marry a man
that I have feelings for

18:41.011 --> 18:42.478
is selfish?

18:42.512 --> 18:44.981
Claire, when these walls went
up, the city was in a shambles.

18:45.015 --> 18:47.550
- Refugees were pouring...
- Pouring in by the thousands.

18:47.584 --> 18:50.152
We could barely afford to feed ourselves.

18:50.187 --> 18:51.487
Yeah, I know.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.723
You've told me this story a thousand times.

18:53.757 --> 18:57.026
You created the V-system so
that everyone had a job to do.

18:57.060 --> 19:00.162
But what you did...

19:00.197 --> 19:01.330
was you trapped people

19:01.365 --> 19:04.166
into a life that they had no way out of.

19:06.870 --> 19:08.771
You know it was supposed to be temporary.

19:08.805 --> 19:10.740
As soon as we were back on our feet,

19:10.774 --> 19:12.274
we were gonna transition to a republic.

19:12.309 --> 19:15.277
So what are you waiting
for? You're Lord of the City.

19:15.312 --> 19:19.749
If you want things to change, change them.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.751
The senate is stuck on the status quo.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.686
You and William... you'd be new blood.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.788
I'm not a politician,
though. I'm a teacher.

19:25.822 --> 19:27.289
Well, now that we've been attacked,

19:27.324 --> 19:28.657
I can't step down, not now.

19:28.692 --> 19:30.993
But eventually you will inherit my seat,

19:31.028 --> 19:32.962
and when that happens,
David Whele will be on you

19:32.996 --> 19:35.197
like a wolf on a lamb.

19:38.235 --> 19:40.469
I am not marrying William Whele.

19:40.504 --> 19:43.171
Because you're in love with Alex.

19:45.509 --> 19:48.377
Yes. And I know what you're thinking.

19:48.412 --> 19:50.713
He's not just a V-2 soldier.

19:50.747 --> 19:52.381
He's the chosen one.

19:52.416 --> 19:56.452
I have no idea what that
means, nor does anyone.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.721
You and William could run this city.

19:58.755 --> 20:01.724
Oh, stop talking about William.

20:01.758 --> 20:03.159
Claire.

20:03.193 --> 20:05.027
Claire!

20:05.062 --> 20:08.364
[Groans in pain, breathing heavily]

20:25.449 --> 20:26.916
So...

20:26.950 --> 20:29.518
how long you been banging Claire Riesen?

20:31.388 --> 20:33.522
No one knows about this, Noma.

20:33.557 --> 20:35.524
I hope not.

20:35.559 --> 20:37.259
Hey.

20:39.229 --> 20:41.197
You need to keep it quiet.

20:41.231 --> 20:43.699
You know you can trust me.

20:43.733 --> 20:45.201
Lannon?

20:45.235 --> 20:47.036
Yeah.

20:47.070 --> 20:48.904
New orders.

20:51.174 --> 20:52.274
What is it?

20:52.309 --> 20:55.778
Security detail reassignment...

20:55.812 --> 20:58.647
House Whele.

20:58.682 --> 21:00.883
We need to talk.

21:00.917 --> 21:02.418
I'm done talking.

21:02.452 --> 21:04.086
You're in danger. Things have changed.

21:04.121 --> 21:06.755
For you, maybe, not for me.

21:06.790 --> 21:08.562
Leave me alone.

21:13.632 --> 21:16.333
[Groans]

21:16.368 --> 21:19.603
Gabriel knows about you.

21:19.638 --> 21:22.072
What does he know...

21:22.107 --> 21:24.808
that I have the tattoos?

21:24.843 --> 21:26.844
He's more dangerous than you think.

21:26.878 --> 21:28.379
You're a target, Alex.

21:28.413 --> 21:30.548
But I'm the chosen one, right?

21:30.582 --> 21:34.051
If I'm the one that's
gonna save the human race,

21:34.085 --> 21:36.620
I must be pretty damn powerful, right?

21:36.655 --> 21:39.557
If I'm gonna unite mankind,

21:39.591 --> 21:43.127
I'm gonna have to fight angels like you.

21:43.161 --> 21:46.096
I'm not your enemy.

21:46.131 --> 21:49.033
It didn't feel that way
when you were whipping me.

21:49.067 --> 21:50.834
Things are different now.

21:50.869 --> 21:53.337
You're gonna have to trust me, Alex.

21:53.371 --> 21:56.674
Trust you? [Chuckles]

21:56.708 --> 22:00.177
Why would I ever do that?

22:00.212 --> 22:03.681
Everything you ever told me was a lie.

22:05.717 --> 22:09.920
I was able to read one
of the tattoos last night.

22:09.955 --> 22:12.690
You know what it said?

22:12.724 --> 22:15.058
"Beware those closest to you."

22:17.562 --> 22:20.231
You stay away from me.

22:33.230 --> 22:35.798
- What are you doing here?
- I just got reassigned.

22:35.833 --> 22:37.700
Mr. Lannon...

22:37.735 --> 22:39.369
a word.

22:39.403 --> 22:41.637
He knows your name?

22:46.043 --> 22:48.811
You know what I did before the war?

22:48.846 --> 22:49.812
No, sir.

22:49.847 --> 22:53.283
I was a televangelist.

22:53.317 --> 22:57.119
I sold religion on television.

22:59.156 --> 23:02.825
I was very, very good at
it. I was a true believer.

23:04.595 --> 23:06.629
The message would differ
from preacher to preacher,

23:06.664 --> 23:08.931
but the point was always the same.

23:08.966 --> 23:13.469
You need me to connect you...

23:13.504 --> 23:14.904
to him.

23:17.875 --> 23:19.976
Since then, I've learned
the error of my ways.

23:20.010 --> 23:22.311
Everything I believed in was wrong.

23:24.548 --> 23:28.151
But what I do know, better
than anyone in this city,

23:28.185 --> 23:31.587
is the psychology of faith.

23:31.622 --> 23:34.624
I have seen firsthand what true believers

23:34.658 --> 23:36.759
are capable of.

23:36.794 --> 23:39.329
They'll open up their
wallets and bow at your feet.

23:39.363 --> 23:41.731
They'll tear each other
apart just to touch you.

23:41.765 --> 23:43.800
Or they'll nail you to a cross.

23:43.834 --> 23:46.469
But either way...

23:46.503 --> 23:48.805
you could bring ruin to our society.

23:48.839 --> 23:50.073
You don't have to worry.

23:50.107 --> 23:53.343
None of this means anything to me.

23:53.377 --> 23:55.678
I won't say a word.

23:55.713 --> 23:58.348
Smart man.

23:58.382 --> 24:01.718
Consul, I've been with House
Riesen for four years now,

24:01.752 --> 24:03.019
and today of all days,

24:03.053 --> 24:06.155
I get transferred to House Whele.

24:06.190 --> 24:07.790
Why?

24:07.825 --> 24:10.660
I didn't order your transfer.

24:10.694 --> 24:12.628
General Riesen did.

24:17.034 --> 24:20.670
William, please.

24:20.704 --> 24:23.206
- I'm sorry to intrude.
- No intrusion.

24:23.240 --> 24:27.543
Sergeant Lannon has just
been assigned to our detail.

24:32.649 --> 24:36.352
[Indistinct chatter]

24:40.057 --> 24:42.392
I apologize for my father.

24:42.426 --> 24:45.428
He's a narcissist of the highest order.

24:45.462 --> 24:47.330
What did you both talk about?

24:47.364 --> 24:50.600
He warned me about the pitfalls of fame.

24:50.634 --> 24:52.802

24:52.836 --> 24:54.069
Bless you.

24:54.104 --> 24:55.872
And you, Sister.

24:55.906 --> 24:57.940

24:57.975 --> 24:59.575

And you, Brother. Here.

Extra rations, medical
care for those in need.

25:10.821 --> 25:13.089
I didn't know you did that.

25:13.123 --> 25:16.392
Well, uh, House Whele isn't
the big bad wolf Lord Riesen

25:16.427 --> 25:18.961
makes us out to be.

25:18.996 --> 25:20.730
Your father's idea?

25:20.764 --> 25:22.231
No.

25:22.266 --> 25:25.001
Charity's not his strong suit.

25:26.336 --> 25:28.037
Alex, um...

25:28.071 --> 25:30.039
Can I call you Alex?

25:30.073 --> 25:31.607
Sure.

25:31.642 --> 25:33.576
I can only imagine what it must be like

25:33.610 --> 25:34.977
to walk in your shoes...

25:35.012 --> 25:38.915
the, um... the burden
that's been placed upon you.

25:38.949 --> 25:40.616
If you ever want to talk to anyone

25:40.651 --> 25:44.420
about anything at all, I'm here.

25:44.455 --> 25:46.322
And I've always been here,

25:46.356 --> 25:49.659
waiting to be of service to you.

25:53.363 --> 25:56.999
[Door opens, closes]

25:57.034 --> 26:00.470
You can't keep your condition
a secret much longer.

26:02.639 --> 26:05.608
You are the only one I can trust, Becca.

26:05.642 --> 26:07.844
You can trust Claire.

26:07.878 --> 26:10.112
She's your daughter, Edward.

26:10.147 --> 26:11.781
She deserves to know.

26:11.815 --> 26:13.483
So she can worry herself sick?

26:13.517 --> 26:15.485
So she'll know why you
want her to marry William.

26:15.519 --> 26:17.453
I don't want her thinking

26:17.488 --> 26:20.289
that her father's got
one foot in the grave.

26:20.324 --> 26:21.824
You have congestive heart failure.
