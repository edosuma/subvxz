00:13.596 --> 00:16.766
Oh, no. No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.812
Sorry to interrupt your lunch,
but there was another mass shooting.

00:21.563 --> 00:22.731
Oh, God, where?

00:22.814 --> 00:24.482
A town outside Tampa called--

00:24.566 --> 00:27.110
Not geographically, dipshit.
What's the location?

00:27.193 --> 00:29.279
What is it, a pharmacy? A haberdashery?

00:29.362 --> 00:33.074
-It was a shopping mall.
-No!

00:34.617 --> 00:37.287
-<i>Ms. Taken</i> is coming out next month.
-I know, sir.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.372
The whole third act
revolves around Courtney Portnoy

00:39.456 --> 00:40.832
shooting people in a mall.

00:40.915 --> 00:43.543
What are we supposed to do now,
not release the movie?

00:43.626 --> 00:45.211
I hope it doesn't come to that.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.672
I am sick and tired
of real-life gun violence

00:47.756 --> 00:50.759
getting in the way of us telling stories
that glamorize gun violence.

00:50.842 --> 00:54.179
Why does this keep happening?
Has the whole world gone crazy?

00:54.262 --> 00:57.849
No, we've just been conditioned
by a rugged individualist culture

00:57.932 --> 01:00.643
woven into the savage architecture
of our country itself,

01:00.727 --> 01:02.479
birthed as it was
through violent uprising,

01:02.562 --> 01:05.398
but perhaps popularized
in the modern imagination by stories of--

01:05.482 --> 01:07.108
Okay, Chomsky, when I want you to talk,

01:07.192 --> 01:09.194
I'll staple a string to your back
and then yank it.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.487
Why not make yourself useful

01:10.570 --> 01:12.614
and schedule a sit-down
with Courtney Portnoy's team

01:12.697 --> 01:15.533
to talk about how we distance ourselves
from this <i>fakakte mishegoss.</i>

01:15.617 --> 01:18.870
Got it.
Except for the foccacia<i> </i>Michigan part.

01:18.953 --> 01:22.332
<i>Excuse me, could you point me</i>
<i>in the direction of an H&M?</i>

01:22.415 --> 01:26.169
<i>Sure. But when you get there,</i>
<i>you're gonna be DOA.</i>

01:26.252 --> 01:29.380
<i>Uh-uh. You picked the wrong shopaholic</i>
<i>to mess with.</i>

01:29.464 --> 01:32.926

02:34.487 --> 02:38.074
-Wow. Carla Mercedes Benzbrown.
-Yep.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.868
-My mother.
-That's right.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.123
[clears throat]

02:45.206 --> 02:46.291
-I lied!
-What?

02:46.374 --> 02:48.042
There's no Carla Mercedes Benzbrown.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.961
-I have no idea who your mother is.
-What?

02:50.044 --> 02:52.255
I don't want to have a relationship
lying to each other.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.173
Okay, so why did you lie to me?

02:54.257 --> 02:55.842
I meant everything else I said.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.844
I'll do everything I can
to help find your mom.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.013
To be honest, moms aren't all that great.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.098
In fact, in my experience,
they're soulless succubi

03:02.182 --> 03:03.766
born fully formed from the ass of Satan.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.436
Oh, my grandmother
sounds like quite a character.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.812
-Can I meet her?
-Oh, my mom?

03:07.896 --> 03:11.357
No, you cannot meet my mom
because she's... dead.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.650
-Oh.
-Dead mom.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.197
BoJack, what happened
to the fudgesicles I bought?

03:18.281 --> 03:21.326
-I lied again. My mom's not dead.
-Stop lying to me!

03:21.409 --> 03:24.495
That was, like, 15 minutes of lie.
Plus, you don't want to meet my mom.

03:24.579 --> 03:25.997
I do. Where does she live?

03:26.080 --> 03:28.541
Oh, this spectacular elder care facility,

03:28.625 --> 03:30.418
she has her own private room
with a nice view,

03:30.501 --> 03:31.836
'round-the-clock medical care,

03:31.920 --> 03:34.672
and plenty of other seniors
to say casually cruel things to

03:34.756 --> 03:37.050
under a passive-aggressive veil
of plausible deniability.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.259
What's this place called?

03:38.343 --> 03:41.846
I want to say Whispering Pines.
Whistling Pines?

03:41.930 --> 03:43.139
Unbelievable.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.767
Something with a W. Winter's Bone?

03:45.850 --> 03:47.393
-Take me there.
-[groans] Fine!

03:47.477 --> 03:49.812
-For real this time?
-Yes. I promise.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.357
I am not gonna lie to you ever again.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.484
-Did you eat the last fudgesicle?
-No.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.404
I lied. I lied about the fudgesicle.

-[groans] That is not good.
-Okay.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.462
Everybody set a Google Alert
for "mass shooting."

04:14.545 --> 04:16.256
Can't keep getting caught
off guard.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.340
This is so sad.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.718
You always hear about mass shootings
affecting other people's movie openings,

04:20.802 --> 04:24.305
but you never think they're gonna
affect <i>your </i>movie opening. [sobs]

to the victims and their families.

04:26.891 --> 04:29.394
-Of course. Yeah, thoughts and prayers.
-Thoughts and prayers.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.854
Tragedy like this
really puts things in perspective.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.107
Like, what are we doing
sitting in a conference room?

04:34.190 --> 04:37.277
Life is short. We should have
this meeting at a water park.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.488
Whoa! A water park
where people have meetings.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.782
-Maybe that's the movie.
-I'm sorry, who is this schmuck?

04:42.865 --> 04:44.826
I'm Courtney's asexual fake fiancÃ©.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.744
He's a common person/supermodel,

04:46.828 --> 04:49.831
being engaged to him makes me appear
more approachable/glamorous.

04:49.914 --> 04:53.376
Okay-slash-whatever. We still have time
to cut the mall shootout from the film.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.253
That still leaves
the movie theater shootout,

04:55.336 --> 04:58.715
-the shootout at the county fair, the--
-[vibrations and buzzing]

04:58.798 --> 05:01.384
We should probably lose
the movie theater shootout.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.594
Right. Well, we still have
the county fair shootout.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.471
-[vibrations and buzzing]
-Oh, dear.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.598
-This is a sad day.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.309
I gotta take this.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.685
-<i>BoJack?</i>
-Hi.

05:10.768 --> 05:12.270
-Where have you been?
<i>-Listen.</i>

05:12.353 --> 05:14.522
I'm sorry.
I was an awful boyfriend to you.

05:14.605 --> 05:17.066
I was an awful client,
and I was an awful friend.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.235
This last year I spent some time away

05:19.319 --> 05:22.947
and it made me realize
how special the people in my life are.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.491
<i>And you might be</i>
<i>the most special of them all.</i>

05:25.575 --> 05:26.826
Wow, BoJack.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.911
[chuckles]
I-- I appreciate that.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.914
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,

05:31.998 --> 05:35.084
do you remember the name
of that super nice elder care facility

05:35.168 --> 05:37.920
that we both agreed was the best place
for my mom to run out the clock?

05:38.004 --> 05:40.173
Oh, pluck a duck.
It's called Walnut Springs.

05:40.256 --> 05:43.134
Walnut Springs!
I knew there was a W in there. Bye!

05:44.510 --> 05:45.511
What?

05:45.595 --> 05:48.181
I feel like I didn't strike the right tone
in the last phone call.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.433
I really am sorry,
and the most important thing is,

05:50.516 --> 05:52.894
you know how dedicated I am
to making things right again.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.020
Okay. Thank you.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.980
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,

05:56.064 --> 05:58.816
turns out there's a few Walnut Springses
in the SoCal area.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.777
It's the one in Santa Barbara, dummy!

06:00.860 --> 06:04.280

-A lotta people!

Courtney's beloved was outlining his plan
to curtail gun violence.

06:09.869 --> 06:13.790
I'm just saying,
if people have the right pumped-up kicks,

06:13.873 --> 06:16.167
maybe they can outrun the bullets.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.669
All this talk of gun violence
is depressing.

06:18.753 --> 06:22.382
<i>-Ms. Taken </i>is a movie about empowerment.
-That's what I've been saying!

06:22.465 --> 06:24.592
It's <i>Bridget Jones</i>

06:24.675 --> 06:27.178
We just have to keep the story
on Courtney,

06:27.261 --> 06:29.639

unstoppable rise

I think she really doesn't know
who you are.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.585
She knows.
This is just like when she pretended

08:22.668 --> 08:25.755
not to recognize me
after my shaky choir solo in eighth grade.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.798
I had to get a ride home with the pianist

08:27.882 --> 08:30.218
who liked to tickle a lot more
than just the ivories.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.888
When I made it home unscathed, she said,
"Huh. I guess no one wants you."

08:33.971 --> 08:36.933
Henrietta, could I trouble you
for some orange juice, please?

08:37.016 --> 08:39.227

So you see
I'm really quite ordinary and relatable.

09:07.463 --> 09:09.882
Yeah, you put your pants on
one leg at a time.

09:09.966 --> 09:13.010
Well, I step into my pants
one leg at a time,

09:13.094 --> 09:16.347
then my trouser-maidens lift the legs
simultaneously to avoid wrinklage.

09:16.430 --> 09:19.517
Well, right, of course,
why else have trouser-maidens?

09:19.600 --> 09:23.312
-Hey.<i> Konichiwa, </i>Princess Mulan.
-Just leave us alone, okay?

09:23.396 --> 09:24.689
I was giving you a compliment.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.233
First, <i>konichiwa </i>is not a compliment,
it's Japanese for hello.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.526
Second, I'm not Japanese.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.861
Maybe I could put something
in that sweet mouth of yours

09:30.945 --> 09:33.114
-so you don't have to talk so much.
-Whoa!

09:33.197 --> 09:34.865

-What...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:36.158 --> 09:37.827

I don't want any trouble.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.961
Why do you even have a gun?

09:47.044 --> 09:49.714
Well, using it in the movie
was so empowering,

09:49.797 --> 09:52.550
and now I just carry it everywhere.
Do you want to hold it?

09:52.633 --> 09:54.510
No, I am very anti-gun.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.013
In fact, I think the whole idea of guns
is inherently--

09:57.096 --> 10:00.141
Holy shit, I'm holding a gun.
How long has this been in my hand?

10:00.224 --> 10:03.561
-Slides right in, doesn't it?
-It actually feels kind of nice.

10:03.644 --> 10:06.230
Would you like to try shooting it?
We can go to my gun range.

[breathless gasp] Whoa...

10:29.003 --> 10:30.921
[Bea] I can't believe you came back.

10:31.505 --> 10:34.634
-Who, me? Or BoJack?
-You look just like him.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.886
-People tell me that.
-[groans]

10:36.969 --> 10:38.763
Your mother's dementia
is progressing rapidly.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.097
-You came out of nowhere.
-Yes.

10:40.181 --> 10:43.476
I snuck up on you on purpose as a symbol
for the alarming creep of dementia.

10:43.559 --> 10:46.562
-It isn't there, until it is.
-Thank you, very colorful.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.440
We tried to call you,
but the number you gave us

10:49.523 --> 10:52.818
-connected to a sandwich shop in Temecula.
-Is that right?

10:52.902 --> 10:54.945
This is the most responsive
she's been in weeks.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.281
I think with regular visits
from you and your daughter--

10:57.365 --> 10:58.240
That's not happening.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.159
Seeing my mom
is like a Terrence Malick movie.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.577
Every ten years or so is bearable,

11:01.661 --> 11:03.579
but more than that
and it starts to get annoying.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.248
She won't last another ten years.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.250
-Well, I guess that's it, then. Bye, Mom!
-Huh?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.294
Come on, Hollyhock,
let's blow this Jell-O stand.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.254
We're gonna come back though, right?

11:12.338 --> 11:13.798
We can't just leave her like this.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.800
You can do anything
if you believe in yourself.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.551
-We have to come back.
-[Bea] Henrietta?

11:17.635 --> 11:18.719
-Every week.
-Why?

11:18.803 --> 11:21.722
Because she's your mother
and dementia is hereditary.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.433
One day, you're gonna be
in a home like this, and so will I,

11:24.517 --> 11:26.685
and wouldn't you want
someone visiting you?

11:26.769 --> 11:28.979
[groans] Fine.
We'll come back. Happy?

11:29.063 --> 11:31.440
Where's my orange juice, slag?

11:33.776 --> 11:35.528
[gulping]

11:35.611 --> 11:36.695
Ahhh!

11:36.779 --> 11:39.240
[gulping]

11:39.323 --> 11:41.033
Ahhh!
See ya next week.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.246
[humming]

11:45.329 --> 11:47.832
-Hey, are we out of milk?
-I can pick up some after work.

11:47.915 --> 11:51.544
Great. Also, real quick follow-up,
why are you holding a gun?

11:51.627 --> 11:52.628
Oh, my God!

11:52.711 --> 11:55.798
Did I drive all the way home
without realizing I was holding a gun?

11:55.881 --> 11:58.968
No wonder that guy at the gas station
didn't charge me for the Red Vines.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.804
[gasps] Did I rob a gas station?

12:01.887 --> 12:03.806
Classic Diane shenanigans.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.226
Or as I call them, "Diane-igans."
All right, be safe.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.978
-[smooches]
-[sighs]

12:09.937 --> 12:10.855
Hmm.

12:12.648 --> 12:15.151
[Diane] <i>Let's get one thing</i>
<i>out of the way right now.</i>

12:15.234 --> 12:18.446
<i>If you're a man,</i>
<i>you're not gonna get it.</i>

12:18.529 --> 12:20.781
<i>Some of you think you get it.</i>
<i>You want to get it.</i>

12:20.865 --> 12:23.784
<i>You listen, nod</i>
<i>and say all the right things</i>

12:23.868 --> 12:25.202
<i>when we tell you our stories.</i>

12:25.286 --> 12:28.122
<i>But you still can't actually know</i>
<i>what it feels like</i>

12:28.205 --> 12:31.208
<i>-to constantly have your guard up.</i>
-[wolf whistle]

12:31.292 --> 12:34.920
<i>In parking garages,</i>
<i>walking the street, even at work.</i>

12:35.004 --> 12:37.423
<i>I'm tired of trying</i>
<i>to help men understand</i>

12:37.506 --> 12:39.049
<i>how it feels to be a woman.</i>

12:39.133 --> 12:41.093
<i>Starting now,</i>
<i>I'm doing what it takes</i>

12:41.177 --> 12:43.804
<i>to put the power in my own hands.</i>

12:43.888 --> 12:46.056
<i>That's why I own a gun.</i>

12:52.021 --> 12:54.899
-That was our senior picnic.
-Oh.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.985
Oh, here I am. There's Polio Larry.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.196
Yup, she sure remembers
all the important people.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.948
-[Hollyhock] And who's this?
-[Bea] That's my brother, Crackerjack.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.533
That's not Crackerjack, that's me.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.285
Thirty seconds
after that picture was taken

13:06.368 --> 13:08.370
you yelled at me
for getting ice cream on my shorts.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.790
No ice cream for me, Henrietta.
I'm watching my figure.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.460
Yeah, you want to look pretty
for when Death comes to visit.

13:14.543 --> 13:15.711
Beth? No.

13:15.794 --> 13:18.380
We stopped talking
after she wouldn't eat my casserole

13:18.464 --> 13:21.509
and then I told the whole supper club
that her son was a gay.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.093
-Ooh.
-Okay. You two enjoy each other.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.554
I'm gonna go see
if I can seduce a lonely dowager

13:25.638 --> 13:27.097
into giving me her night-night pills.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.682
Wow. Is this you?

13:28.766 --> 13:32.478
-[Bea] This is me at my debutante ball.
-You were so beautiful.

13:32.561 --> 13:36.065
You could be thin, too.
Just go easy on the sweets

13:36.148 --> 13:39.193
and when you go somewhere,
don't walk, gallop.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.237
Ice cold, Grammy-gram.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.865
[both] Morning time, Hollywoo!

13:44.949 --> 13:46.659
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.452
And I'm A Billy Bush Type.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.871
Here's something
I'm just now reading on a cue card.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.499
All the ladies
are getting concealed carry permits.

13:53.582 --> 13:54.750
It's the newest thing.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.710
I wouldn't want to be around
one of those ladies

13:56.794 --> 13:59.171
at a certain time of the month,
if you know what I mean.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.965
[laughs] I don't.

14:01.048 --> 14:04.134
Joking aside, I think it's great
these gals have a hobby.

14:04.218 --> 14:08.681
Oh, and I'm being told by our producers
that we have a breaking news alert--

14:08.764 --> 14:11.225
-there has been another mass shooting.
-[groans]

14:11.308 --> 14:14.395
I am totally unqualified
to cover a news story this important.

14:14.478 --> 14:17.523
But as a straight white male,
I will plow forward with confidence

14:17.606 --> 14:19.942
and assume I'm doing fine.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.280
[groans] Again with the crazy gunmen.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.781
Princess Carolyn, if this keeps up,

14:25.865 --> 14:27.783
we're gonna have to put this movie
on the shelf

14:27.867 --> 14:30.911
next to that wacky vacation comedy we did
about the klutzy babysitter.

14:30.995 --> 14:34.415
-[Todd] <i>Ha! That sounds hilarious!</i>
-What the hell are you doing on this call?

14:34.498 --> 14:36.917
Imagining that funny movie
you just described.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.169
Okay, what do all these shootings
have in common?

14:39.253 --> 14:41.839
Guns? Bullets? Who are you,
Art Linkletter? Just spit it out.

14:41.922 --> 14:45.634
Men! What if we played up
the "Ms." in <i>Ms. Taken</i>?

14:45.718 --> 14:47.386
In a world of increasing terror,

14:47.469 --> 14:50.806
our movie tells women
they don't have to be afraid anymore.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.058
-Yeah, now you're talking.
-When you put it that way,

14:53.142 --> 14:56.437
it almost sounds like these mass shootings
could be a good thing for the movie.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.315
No, no, no, of course not.
They're a terrible tragedy.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.025
Thoughts and prayers
are with the victims.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.693
-Right, thoughts and prayers.
-But...

15:02.776 --> 15:07.489
anything that makes women feel unsafe
might actually help our box office.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.451
But you don't want women to feel unsafe.

15:10.534 --> 15:11.368
Of course not!

15:11.452 --> 15:13.120
Nobody wants that,
nobody's saying that.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.664
But if they already <i>do</i> feel unsafe,

15:15.748 --> 15:17.207
there's no reason not to capitalize.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.293
Right, if they already feel unsafe anyway.

15:19.376 --> 15:22.338
Exactly, we're not making them
feel unsafe.

15:22.421 --> 15:26.634
We're just profiting, albeit indirectly,
from there being more mass shootings.

15:26.717 --> 15:27.968
[cell phone vibrates]

15:28.052 --> 15:30.346
In that case,
I got good news and I got bad news.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.681
Bad news is
you're gonna want to avoid the 405.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.977
-Ta-da!
-Ugh! Keep it down.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.979
Why are you carrying that thin hard book?

15:39.063 --> 15:40.773
It's not a book, it's a DVD case.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.733
We did a special episode about elder care.

15:42.816 --> 15:45.152
Now we're gonna watch it
and learn how to handle this bitch.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.695
When you say "this bitch",

15:46.779 --> 15:49.031
do you mean your mom's dementia
or your mom?

15:49.114 --> 15:50.950
I think you can pick that up
through context.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.368
Season two, episode 12.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.453
"I'm Ready For My Close-Up,
Mr. Dementia."

15:54.536 --> 15:55.955
-I'll go lie down.
-[music plays]

15:56.038 --> 15:59.500
<i>-Hey, Ethan, who's your friend?</i>
-[Olivia] <i>Ethan made a friend?</i>

15:59.583 --> 16:01.710
<i>This old man followed me home</i>
<i>from the park.</i>

16:01.794 --> 16:03.545
<i>-Can I keep him?</i>
-[audience] <i>Aww.</i>

16:03.629 --> 16:07.424

16:07.508 --> 16:08.968
-BoJack?
-Mom?

16:09.051 --> 16:11.470
Hush, Henrietta.
That's my son on the television.

16:11.553 --> 16:14.682
-You know him?
-I think I'd know my own son, wouldn't I?

16:14.765 --> 16:16.016
[Ethan] <i>You heard the boss man.</i>

16:16.100 --> 16:19.895
<i>Guess your daughter, the bikini model,</i>
<i>will have to pick you up at the park.</i>

16:19.979 --> 16:21.188
<i>Daughter, the bikini model?</i>

16:21.271 --> 16:24.316
<i>Whoa, whoa, Ethan,</i>
<i>this man is our guest!</i>

16:24.400 --> 16:27.069
[laughs]

16:27.861 --> 16:28.904
Uh...

16:28.988 --> 16:30.030
Huh.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.702
[clears throat]

16:34.785 --> 16:37.871
-You know I hate guns, right?
-I know.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.124
Although my official stated
political opinion

16:40.207 --> 16:42.960
is I respect the Second Amendment
but I think some gun purchases

16:43.043 --> 16:45.379
should require the barest amount
of background checks.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.923
Mr. Peanutbutter,
you know I hate guns, too.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.342
Or I thought I did. Or I still do, mostly.

16:50.426 --> 16:54.013
But being a gun owner finally makes me
feel as safe walking down the street

16:54.096 --> 16:56.432
as a man gets to feel all the time.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.143
And that's an incredible feeling
I'm not ready to give up yet.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.812
If you can frack under our house,
I should get to have a gun.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.063
All right, that's fair.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.815
I'm really proud we've found a way

17:04.898 --> 17:07.693
to keep our personal lives
and our political lives compartmentalized.

17:07.776 --> 17:08.777
Me, too.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.197
<i>-You have no idea...</i>
<i>-Yes. I have no idea?</i>

17:12.281 --> 17:14.700
<i>-Is your bubble of privilege so thick...</i>
<i>-What's with humans and guns?</i>

17:14.783 --> 17:16.243
<i>You're addicted to these things.</i>

17:16.326 --> 17:19.038
<i>And what is it with men</i>
<i>and not wanting women to feel safe?</i>

17:19.121 --> 17:20.539
<i>-I don't--</i>
<i>-This is a gendered issue...</i>

17:20.622 --> 17:21.874
<i>-Excuse me!</i>
<i>-...make no mistake.</i>

17:21.957 --> 17:23.459
<i>-I don't think women...</i>
<i>-You can't sympathize...</i>

17:23.542 --> 17:25.294
<i>...running around with guns</i>
<i>makes anybody safer.</i>

17:25.377 --> 17:26.795
<i>-Yeah. That's the danger.</i>
<i>-I don't--</i>

17:26.879 --> 17:27.963
<i>-Excuse me.</i>
<i>-Not the men</i>

17:28.047 --> 17:31.884
<i>who commit 90 percent of murders,</i>
<i>it's the crazy hysterical women</i>

17:31.967 --> 17:32.926
<i>you gotta worry about!</i>

17:33.010 --> 17:34.970
[grunting and moaning]

17:35.054 --> 17:38.807
[Diane] Yes, yes! Fill my chamber
with your powerful bullets!

17:41.101 --> 17:42.770
Beatrice, look who's back.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.730
And we brought more<i> Horsin' Around.</i>

17:44.813 --> 17:45.939
Oh? Good.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.233
Because you love that BoJack, right?

17:48.317 --> 17:52.446
Well, he's not much of a son,
but the show can be a comfort sometimes.

17:52.529 --> 17:53.947
[exhales]

17:57.409 --> 18:00.037
They were playing your dumb show
in his hospital room.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.331
Which dumb show? New one or old one?

18:02.414 --> 18:05.751
In the episode I saw, you walked in
on your daughter in the shower.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.795
The old one. That episode got us

18:07.878 --> 18:10.464
into the <i>TV Guide</i>
"Cheers and Jeers" column.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.715
We did not get a "Cheers."

18:11.799 --> 18:14.301
You always could play the fool, BoJack.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.970
We have to have this conversation now,
on the way to Dad's funeral?

18:18.263 --> 18:21.433
[sighs] There was so much more
I wanted to say to him.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.728
Well... you can forget it now.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.358
[laughs]

18:29.441 --> 18:34.321
[Olivia] <i>And since </i>you <i>saw </i>me <i>naked,</i>
<i>that means I get to see </i>you <i>naked!</i>

18:34.404 --> 18:37.282
[The Horse] <i>Something tells me</i>
<i>I'm gonna regret this.</i>

18:37.366 --> 18:38.659
-[audience laughing]
-[groans]

18:38.742 --> 18:41.120
Out of the way, hag,
you're blocking the screen.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.371
Uh-huh.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.671
I know this must be painful for you.

18:50.754 --> 18:53.132
Not painful, boring. This place sucks.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.425
If I'm not getting credit
for coming, what's the point?

18:55.509 --> 18:59.388
If only there was some way for her
to connect the BoJack from the show

18:59.471 --> 19:01.390
with the BoJack who visits her every week.

19:01.473 --> 19:05.853
-Yeah, too bad we can't. Or can we?
-Can we what?

19:05.936 --> 19:08.730
Put on a live episode
of <i>Horsin' Around </i>in the nursing home.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.274
-Good thinking, Hollyhock.
-Uh...

19:10.357 --> 19:12.192
We'll do a <i>Horsin' Around</i>
here at the home.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.069
She'll love it
because it's her son BoJack.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.737
-Okay...
-Then after the show,

19:15.821 --> 19:19.783
I'll come out and say hello.
And she'll say, "BoJack? Is that you?"

19:19.867 --> 19:21.368
When her eyes spark with recognition,

19:21.451 --> 19:23.704
I'm gonna sit down next to her,
I'm gonna squeeze her hand

19:23.787 --> 19:25.914
and get real close and say...

19:25.998 --> 19:28.292
-"Fuck you, Mom."
-What?

19:28.375 --> 19:30.711
I can finally tell her off!
I'm gonna say, "Look at you,

19:30.794 --> 19:33.130
you old piece of shit,
rotting in a nursing home!"

19:33.213 --> 19:35.757
-Now I have the power!
-That's what you want to say to her?

19:35.841 --> 19:39.094
Oh, it's gonna be great!
I can't wait to see the look on her face.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.389
Okay, let's do this. Let's put on a show!

19:46.852 --> 19:48.187
[ringing]

19:48.270 --> 19:49.479
-Hey!
-Bad news.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.231
Hear about the mass shooting
outside Tulsa?

19:51.315 --> 19:53.108
Terrible tragedy.
Thoughts and prayers.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.485
We really have to do something
about these men who go...

19:55.569 --> 19:57.738
No, P.C. This time it was a woman.

19:57.821 --> 20:01.658
A woman mass shooter?
Oh, no, that really <i>is </i>bad news!

20:01.742 --> 20:04.661
I just think this is what happens
when you give women guns.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.288
They start shooting people with them.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.415
I mean, do they even know
what guns are for?

20:08.498 --> 20:11.627
I don't feel safe anymore
walking down my own street alone at night.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.794
Me, a man!

20:12.878 --> 20:15.714
I am convening a series
of congressional hearings

20:15.797 --> 20:17.507
on the matter of women and guns.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.844
Because even one death
from the bullet of a female gun owner

20:20.928 --> 20:22.137
is too many.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.598
What are my constituents supposed to do,

20:24.681 --> 20:27.559
not compliment
random women on the street

20:27.643 --> 20:29.269
because they might be
carrying a gun?

20:29.353 --> 20:33.565
We cannot allow our lives
to be dictated by that kind of fear.

20:33.649 --> 20:38.111
So you see, the trigger was specifically
designed for a man's grip

20:38.195 --> 20:40.155
and a man's temperament.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.657
Look, all I'm saying is

20:41.740 --> 20:44.785
maybe you shouldn't blame women
for wanting guns.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.829
Maybe you should blame
the constant societal messaging

20:47.913 --> 20:52.042
that tells us we are safe only as long
as the men around us allow us to be.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.462
So if you have a problem
with women carrying firearms,

20:55.545 --> 20:58.757
you can roll up your sleeves
and actually work to create a society

20:58.840 --> 21:03.387
where women feel safe and equal,
or you can just ban all guns.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.766
-[gavel banging]
-The ayes have it.

21:07.849 --> 21:11.728
Possession of any firearm is now illegal
in the state of California.

21:11.812 --> 21:12.813
We did it, boys.

21:12.896 --> 21:13.772
-Huzzah!
-Yes!

21:13.855 --> 21:15.774
-Congratulations!
-Fabulous!

21:16.608 --> 21:18.443
I thought that was gonna go the other way.

21:18.527 --> 21:22.030
Wow, Diane.
You just passed sensible gun legislation.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.158
I can't believe this country hates women
more than it loves guns.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.243
No?

21:30.038 --> 21:32.040
BoJack, I don't know about this.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.293
You'll be fine.
Just remember to enunciate.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.420
It helps if you imagine
performing for the back row.

21:36.503 --> 21:39.047
-Not that. I mean...
-Shh! Here they come. Gladys, hit it!

21:39.798 --> 21:44.094
[plays <i>Horsin' Around</i> theme]

21:44.177 --> 21:47.514
Too bad I could never run for president,
'cause I love waffling!

21:47.597 --> 21:48.849
Wha-- What is this?

21:48.932 --> 21:51.351
Olivia, you usually love
my breakfast humor.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.811
Why so glum, sugarplum?

21:52.894 --> 21:56.231
It's this algebra homework
that gives me the blues.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.442
-X-axis? Y-axis?
-[panting and gasping]

21:58.525 --> 22:00.902
Where's the 'Y'-should-I-care axis?

22:00.986 --> 22:02.362
Henrietta, what are you doing?

22:02.446 --> 22:03.989
BoJack, maybe we should stop.

22:04.072 --> 22:06.450
We just started. Let's at least
get through the first act

22:06.533 --> 22:08.660
before we judge ourselves
too harshly, huh?

22:08.744 --> 22:11.163
I wonder if there's a way
to make math fun.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.165
-[Hollyhock] Math will never be fun.
-[clicking]

22:13.248 --> 22:15.876
-The only thing I like is rap music songs.
-[groaning and panting]

22:15.959 --> 22:18.462
Make this stop. How do I turn this off?

22:18.545 --> 22:22.007
Don't change it.
I want to see if this married couple

22:22.090 --> 22:24.176
can work through their differences.

22:24.259 --> 22:25.552
-Gimme the remote!
-This isn't right!

22:25.635 --> 22:27.596
-Guys, sharing is caring!
-[grunts]

22:27.679 --> 22:29.473
Oh, my God. Code red, code red!

22:29.556 --> 22:31.683
What is happening? I don't like this!

22:31.767 --> 22:32.684
No!

22:32.768 --> 22:33.977
-[Bea] Let go of me.
-Oh, God.

22:34.061 --> 22:37.773
I am the heiress
to the Sugarman Sugarcube Company.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.317
You can't do this to me!

22:40.400 --> 22:42.235
[screaming]

22:42.319 --> 22:45.405
I never get to watch what I want.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.951
You think we should
still finish the episode, or...?

22:51.828 --> 22:54.372
Our insurance policy
is very strict and very clear.

22:54.456 --> 22:57.417
Once a resident becomes violent,
we can no longer house them.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.002
Can you recommend another facility?

22:59.086 --> 23:00.962
Frankly, at your mother's rate
of deterioration,

23:01.046 --> 23:02.506
she probably doesn't have much time.

23:02.589 --> 23:05.759
I recommend she spend it surrounded
by the people who care about her.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.636
Okay, who are they?
Do you have their number?

23:07.719 --> 23:10.472
-I was referring to you and your daughter.
-Oh. Uh...

23:10.555 --> 23:12.516
We'll take her.
She can have the guest room,

23:12.599 --> 23:15.268
-and I can sleep on the couch. Right?
-[groans]

23:15.352 --> 23:18.063
Okay. If she really doesn't have
much time left.

23:18.146 --> 23:20.565
But if we get to this time next year,
she's still hanging on,

23:20.649 --> 23:23.610
you will be getting
a very strongly worded letter, mister.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.864
<i>Excuse me, could you point me</i>
<i>in the direction of an H&M?</i>

23:27.948 --> 23:29.157
<i>-Sure.</i>
-[click]

23:29.241 --> 23:31.409
That's all we got,
once we took out all the guns.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.286
Maybe it could work
as an H&M commercial?

23:33.370 --> 23:35.497
It's a shame. It was a great movie.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.874
[sighs] Yeah.
Cut down in the prime of its life.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.210
Well, I'm very sorry for your loss.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.420
Eh, I'll be fine.

23:45.882 --> 23:48.468
Hey, Beatrice, you hungry?
I could make Pop-Tarts.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.512
[Bea] No, thank you.

23:50.595 --> 23:53.140
You want to watch
another <i>Horsin' Around</i> episode?

23:53.223 --> 23:54.432
What's the point?

23:54.516 --> 23:56.351
-Oh.
-[growls]

23:56.434 --> 23:57.686
Oh, God.

24:06.361 --> 24:08.864
I'm sorry you didn't get
to tell your mom off.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.866
I keep thinking
about all the things I never said

24:10.949 --> 24:13.160
because I was so sure
there'd be other days to say them.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.704
-Why don't you tell her now?
-It's not the same.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.789
I should have done it
back when she knew who I was,

24:17.873 --> 24:19.249
back when it would mean something.

24:19.332 --> 24:20.709
But now, she's gonna die

24:20.792 --> 24:22.878
and she's never gonna know
just how much I hate her.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.921
I'm sure she knew, BoJack.

24:25.005 --> 24:28.049
-Yeah? You're not just saying that?
-She read your book, didn't she?

24:28.133 --> 24:31.720
[sighs] Yeah, but I really wanted
to say it to her face.

24:31.803 --> 24:36.766
Well, hey, she's here now, right?
And she has good days and bad days.

24:36.850 --> 24:41.938
Maybe, eventually, she'll recognize you.
And then you can totally rip into her.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.732
-You really think so?
-Mm-hmm.
