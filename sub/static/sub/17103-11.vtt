01:49.843 --> 01:52.380
LET'S GO.
KEEP IT GOIN'!

01:53.447 --> 01:55.183

CLYDE, BURLEY,

01:57.351 --> 01:58.919
Stumpy:
HEY, SAMSON.
SAMSON.

01:59.019 --> 02:01.855
YOU'RE PLAYING YOUR CARDS
CLOSE TO THE VEST ABOUT
OUR NEXT STOP.

02:01.955 --> 02:05.493
- WE'RE GOING TO NEW CANAAN.
- NEW CANAAN? I'VE NEVER
HEARD OF THAT.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.795
BIG CHRISTIAN CAMP

02:07.895 --> 02:10.931
- A COUPLE HOURS FROM HERE.

02:11.031 --> 02:14.235
THAT'S RIGHT.
SOUTH OF SALINAS.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.470
FULL OF HOLY ROLLERS?

02:16.570 --> 02:18.672
17,000 THUMPERS,

02:18.772 --> 02:22.643

RIPE TO BE TRIMMED.

02:22.743 --> 02:26.280
WHAT THE HELL ARE ME

ACT OUT BIBLE STORIES?

02:26.380 --> 02:29.383
NO, YOU'RE
GONNA BE DARK.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.619
DARK?
I CAN'T BE DARK.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.222
I GOT EXPENSES, SAMSON.
I GOT OBLIGATIONS.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.890
STUMPY, THINGS ARE
TOUGH ALL OVER!

02:42.763 --> 02:45.899
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.969
LILA, I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.205
DON'T YOU WALK AWAY
FROM ME.

02:51.305 --> 02:55.443
HAWKINS KILLED LODZ
AND YOU COVERED IT UP.

02:57.345 --> 02:59.747
YOU'RE CRAZY!

03:00.781 --> 03:02.416
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET THIS.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.819
AIN'T HAPPY?
TAKE IT UP WITH MANAGEMENT.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.899
Man:
FOLKS, MAKE SURE
YOUR SATCHELS ARE OPEN.

03:18.999 --> 03:22.102
SUITCASES?
HAND 'EM OVER.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.605
GOTTA CHECK THEM ALL.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.312
HERE YOU GO.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.850
ANY LUCK?

04:09.950 --> 04:13.587
THE PLACE IS BATTENED DOWN
TIGHTER THAN A WORK-FARM.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.523
YEAH.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.725
FOR A FELLA
WHO BELIEVES IN HEAVEN,

04:17.825 --> 04:20.661
THAT PREACHER IS SURE
WORRIED ABOUT DYING.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.300
- YOU HEADING OUT?
- YEAH.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.569
YOU RECKON
YOU'LL FIND 'EM?

04:28.669 --> 04:32.306
BOUND TO BE SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN HERE AND THERE
ON THE LINCOLN HIGHWAY.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.942
BESIDES,
THEY'RE HARD TO MISS.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.482
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
COME WITH ME.

04:44.518 --> 04:48.722
THE WAY THINGS ARE,
IT MIGHT BE NEITHER ONE OF US
CAN GET BACK IN HERE AGAIN.

04:48.822 --> 04:52.059
- THEN WHAT?
- YOU GOT TO PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T DO NOTHING

04:52.159 --> 04:54.294
TILL I COME BACK
WITH THE OTHERS.

04:54.395 --> 04:59.299
IF I GET A CHANCE AT HIM,
I'M TAKING IT.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.991
WELL,
SLEPT IN THIS MORNING?

05:24.091 --> 05:25.659
OOH!

05:25.759 --> 05:27.795
WELL NOW, WHO WOULD
HAVE GUESSED?

05:27.895 --> 05:31.399
DO YOU KNOW WHAT MY BROTHER
WOULD DO TO YOU IF I TOLD HIM
HOW YOU SPOKE TO ME?

05:31.499 --> 05:34.067
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD HIM, HAVE YOU?

05:34.167 --> 05:36.504
( laughing )

05:42.376 --> 05:44.177
HOW LONG
YOU BEEN HERE?

05:44.277 --> 05:45.613
NEW CANAAN?

05:45.713 --> 05:48.449
WE MOVED OVER
WITH BROTHER JUSTIN
FROM MINTERN.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.518
BEFORE THAT,
WE WERE IN TULSA.

05:50.618 --> 05:54.588
- YOU?
- A COUPLE DAYS.
CAME FROM TEXAS.

05:54.688 --> 05:58.191
- THE NAME'S WILLIE.
- HENRY.

05:58.291 --> 06:01.462
HEY THERE, HENRY.

06:01.562 --> 06:04.097
WHAT YOU DO AROUND HERE?

06:04.197 --> 06:06.467
I'M ON SECURITY DETAIL.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.536
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
AT HOW MANY PEOPLE

06:08.636 --> 06:10.704
WOULD LIKE TO SEE
BROTHER JUSTIN DEAD.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.841
- IS THAT SO?
- OH YEAH.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.610
I WAS HOPING TO GET
POSTED UP AT THE HOUSE

06:16.710 --> 06:19.413
BUT I AIN'T BEEN HERE
LONG ENOUGH.

06:19.513 --> 06:23.884
THE FELLAS UP THERE,
THEY GOT SPECIAL TRAINING?

06:23.984 --> 06:27.020
NO, JUST GUNS.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.091
MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

06:35.162 --> 06:36.664
Val:
I'M TELLING YOU,
JUSTIN,

06:36.764 --> 06:39.032
MEN LIKE DEVINE ARE
RUINING THIS COUNTRY!

06:39.132 --> 06:41.469
HE'S A GODDAMN ATHEIST!

06:47.441 --> 06:49.743
THANK YOU, SOFIE.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.315
ARE YOU SURE YOU GENTLEMEN
WON'T JOIN ME?

06:55.415 --> 06:58.886
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.889
HE MADE A SPEECH
AT THE STATE HOUSE GOING ON
ABOUT YOU AND VAL

07:01.989 --> 07:03.857
AND THE SEPARATION
OF CHURCH AND STATE.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.994
THE IDEA THAT RELIGION
AND POLITICS DON'T MIX
WAS INVENTED BY THE DEVIL

07:07.094 --> 07:10.363
TO KEEP CHRISTIANS
FROM RUNNING THEIR
OWN COUNTRY.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.032
( sighs )

07:12.132 --> 07:15.469
SEE HOW SHE CUTS THE CRUST
FROM THE BREAD--

07:15.569 --> 07:18.305
IT'S ALMOST
TOO PERFECT TO EAT.

07:18.405 --> 07:21.842
HE CALLED ME
YOUR "PORCINE PATSY."

07:21.942 --> 07:25.846
DO YOU KNOW WHY THE HEBREWS
DO NOT PARTAKE OF THE PIG?

07:25.946 --> 07:28.248
HE SAID YOU WERE TRYING
TO GERRYMANDER THE ELECTION,

07:28.348 --> 07:32.285
TRYING TO PASS A LAW SAYING
THEM MIGRANTS OF YOURS
AIN'T LEGAL TO VOTE.

07:32.385 --> 07:35.523
AND WITHOUT THEM,
WE'RE IN THE JACKPOT
WITHOUT ANY BLUE CHIPS.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.625
"THOUGH THE SWINE
BE CLOVEN-FOOTED,

07:37.725 --> 07:41.629
YET HE CHEWETH NOT THE CUD;
HE IS UNCLEAN TO YOU."

07:41.729 --> 07:44.264
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
JUSTIN, STAY WITH US.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.500
WE'RE TRYING
TO HELP YOU HERE!

07:54.374 --> 07:56.476
WE DON'T NEED THEM.

07:56.577 --> 07:59.513
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I MEAN WITHOUT THEM OKIES,

07:59.613 --> 08:02.516
DEVINE HAS A-- HAS A--
HAS A FIX ON THE WHOLE
DISTRICT.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.652
ONCE THE VOTERS
OF SAN BENITO COUNTY

08:04.752 --> 08:07.320
UNDERSTAND THE CHOICE
PRESENTED THEM,

08:07.420 --> 08:11.792
THERE WILL BE NO QUESTION
FOR WHOM THEY WILL CAST
THEIR BALLOTS.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.034
THAT'S RIGHT.

08:22.235 --> 08:25.005
FAITH, GENTLEMEN.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.417
( distant thunder
rumbling )

08:37.517 --> 08:39.419
Guard:
I DON'T LIKE IT.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.555
BACK HOME,
A SKY LIKE THAT,

08:41.655 --> 08:43.190
WE'D BE BRINGING IN
THE ANIMALS.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.726
THEY AIN'T GOT TWISTERS
IN CALIFORNIA, STAG NUT.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.862
WELL,
IT DON'T LOOK RIGHT.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.066
HOLD UP.
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

08:53.166 --> 08:54.668
FIREWOOD.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.637
TOLD ME TO BRING IT
ON UP.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.538
WHO TOLD YOU
TO BRING IT ON UP?

08:58.639 --> 09:02.576
A FELLA DOWN THERE,
ACTS LIKE HE'S TOP MAN.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.879
- RED-HAIRED GUY?
- YEAH.

09:05.979 --> 09:09.082
THAT'S ENNIS.
THINKS HE'S BOSS.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.351
TOLD ME TO STACK IT
IN THE WOODBOX.

09:11.451 --> 09:14.187
EVERYONE'S GOT
TO GET CHECKED.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.924
GO ON, CHECK HIM.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.571
ALL RIGHT.
JUST HURRY IT UP.

09:35.743 --> 09:38.612
Sofie:
I WOULD READ TO YOU,
BUT I HAVE TO GET READY.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.214
BROTHER JUSTIN WANTS US
ALL THERE BY NOON.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.585
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D WANT TO BE BAPTIZED...

09:45.686 --> 09:48.221
UNTIL I MET HIM.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.931
I WISH YOU COULD
BE THERE, REVEREND.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.310
MAYBE
IT WOULD HELP YOU.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.917
I HAD BETTER
GO WASH UP.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.398
( door closes )

12:00.620 --> 12:04.958
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN GET FOR YOU
BEFORE I GO?

12:06.860 --> 12:09.196
ALL RIGHT THEN.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.298
PRAY FOR ME.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.734
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
YOUNG MAN?

14:27.834 --> 14:30.503
WHAT IS THAT?

14:32.772 --> 14:35.142
THEY TOLD ME
YOU NEEDED FIREWOOD.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.377
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE
YOU WANTED IT.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.947
PUT THAT DOWN.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.663
THERE'S NO FIREPLACE
UP HERE.

14:56.763 --> 14:59.066
NO, MA'AM.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.438
HAVE YOU BEEN BAPTIZED YET?

15:05.538 --> 15:07.174
NO, MA'AM.

15:07.274 --> 15:10.610
MY BROTHER IS
BAPTIZING CONVERTS
DOWN AT THE POND TODAY.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.517
- ( hatchet clanks )
- LEAVE IT!

15:50.083 --> 15:53.320
THE KID DID IT.
HE KILLED LODZ.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.623
- HAWKINS KILLED HIM?
- YEP.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.958
AW, COME ON.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.532
AND THE LITTLE WORM
HELPED HIM COVER IT UP.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.001
I CAN'T PROVE IT.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.469
BUT I KNOW.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.004
HOW?

16:11.104 --> 16:13.006
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME
IF I TOLD YOU.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.608
JUST TRUST ME.
THERE'S NO DOUBT
ABOUT IT.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.411
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.918
DEAD OR ALIVE,
THAT SON OF A BITCH
DON'T MEAN NOTHING TO ME.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.288
HE AIN'T MY PROBLEM.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.257
WE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS,
FELIX.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.360
SAMSON'S LOST
HIS GODDAMNED MIND.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.695
AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE PUT UP WITH

16:35.795 --> 16:38.331
FROM THAT GREASE POT,
HE'S GOT A LOT OF NERVE

16:38.431 --> 16:41.468
HAVING US SET UP IN
A PACK OF BIBLE THUMPERS!

16:41.568 --> 16:44.003
HOW'RE WE SUPPOSED
TO MAKE A LIVING?

16:44.104 --> 16:45.705
WELL, UM...

16:45.805 --> 16:48.041
STILL GOT A COUPLE BOXES
OF THEM FRENCH POSTCARDS
WE COULD SELL.

16:48.141 --> 16:52.579
FELIX, THEY AIN'T
GONNA LET US SELL NO
DIRTY PICTURES NEITHER.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.585
BUD'S GONNA KILL ME.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.853
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE IS.

17:00.953 --> 17:03.323
YOU REMEMBER
TINY WALKER?

17:03.423 --> 17:04.957
YEAH, TINY.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.260
HE MISSED TWO PAYMENTS.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.829
HIS KID FOUND HIM
NAILED TO A TREE,

17:09.929 --> 17:12.799
SHOT THROUGH
THE LEFT EYE.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.037
WATCH YOUR STEP.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.107
Justin:
I SAY UNTO THEE,
"REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED

17:20.207 --> 17:23.376
SO THAT YE MAY BE FORGIVEN,

UNCLEAN SPIRIT!"

18:47.194 --> 18:49.362
ONE OF THE MOST TREASURED

18:49.462 --> 18:52.732
SHE WAS ASLEEP
AND WE WOKE HER UP!

18:52.832 --> 18:54.066
( muttering )

18:54.167 --> 18:55.868
AMEN.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.640
Man:
BROTHER JUSTIN?

19:11.284 --> 19:15.355
COME ON OUT.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.258
Man 2:
COME ON OUT.
OUT OF THE WATER.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.957
( whispers )
HEY.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.892
( whispers )
IT WAS YOU.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.728
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

19:57.464 --> 19:59.299
I DIDN'T COME FOR YOU.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.972
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

20:06.072 --> 20:09.309
THIS AIN'T A GOOD PLACE
FOR YOU, SOF.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.077
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:11.177 --> 20:14.314
THE PREACHER.

20:14.414 --> 20:17.984
LISTEN, THE PREACHER,
HE'S EVIL.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.720
- EVIL? NO.
- YEAH.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.289
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM, BEN.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.190
I'VE SEEN HIM
IN MY DREAMS.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.926
I KNOW WHO HE IS.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.161
FROM YOUR DREAMS?
THAT'S CRAZY.

20:29.262 --> 20:32.565
BROTHER JUSTIN
IS A GREAT MAN.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.835
HE'S CHANGED MY LIFE.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.871
WHEN I LEFT THE CARNIVAL...

20:38.971 --> 20:40.807
I WAS EMPTY.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.475
I HAD NOTHING.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.912
NOW, BECAUSE OF HIM,
I HAVE SOMETHING TO HOLD ONTO.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.515
HE'S NOT
WHO YOU THINK HE IS.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.954
WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

20:55.054 --> 20:58.358
- LEAVE ME ALONE.
- I CAN'T JUST
LEAVE YOU HERE.

20:58.458 --> 21:02.462
I DON'T NEED YOU TO PROTECT ME
FROM THE BEST THING THAT'S
EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.364
HIS NAME IS
ALEXSEI BELYAKOV.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.865
HE'S A RUSSIAN.

21:05.965 --> 21:10.470
HE KILLED MY FATHER,
AND HE AIMS TO KILL ME TOO.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.842
( sniffing )
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.245
SOFIE.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.748
SOFIE.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.894
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE IT
RIGHT FOR US, SAMSON,

21:34.994 --> 21:36.863
OR WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

21:36.963 --> 21:40.367
- NOW, RITA SUE--
- DON'T GIVE ME
YOUR BULLSHIT!

21:40.467 --> 21:43.403
IF WE'RE GONNA BE DARK,
WE NEED TO BE COMPENSATED.

21:43.503 --> 21:46.406
I WOULD IF I COULD,
BUT I CAN'T.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.375
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THAT, SAMSON.

21:48.475 --> 21:52.078
YOU AND ME, WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER.

21:52.178 --> 21:55.615
YOU WAS THE ONE
THAT TOOK US TO BABYLON.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.116
YOU OWE ME.

21:57.216 --> 22:00.086
YOU OWE THIS FAMILY
SOMETHING.

22:00.186 --> 22:01.888
I'M SORRY.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.757
I REALLY TRULY
AM SORRY,

22:04.857 --> 22:07.394
BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU
WHAT I AIN'T GOT.

22:07.494 --> 22:10.930
WE DOWN TO WIENIES
AND KRAUT AS IT IS.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.366
WELL THEN...

22:13.466 --> 22:15.502
WE'RE LEAVING.

22:15.602 --> 22:19.639
- ( sighs )
- WE'LL GO AS FAR
AS CALIFORNIA WITH YOU,

22:19.739 --> 22:23.209
BUT IF YOU GO
INTO THAT CAMP,

22:23.309 --> 22:25.945
YOU'RE GOING IN THERE
WITHOUT US.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.948
YOU DO
WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.428
OKAY, IT'S SETTLED.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.496
- WE'RE PULLING ANCHOR.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:43.596 --> 22:45.231
I MEAN, WE GO AS FAR
AS CALIFORNIA,

22:45.331 --> 22:48.300
THEN WE'RE ON OUR OWN.
WE DON'T NEED HIS
TWO-BIT OPERATION.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.336
HE SURE AS HELL
NEEDS US, HE'LL SEE.

22:50.437 --> 22:52.572
GUESS YOU'RE FINALLY
GETTING TO HOLLYWOOD, GIRL.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.408
I AIN'T GOING WITH YOU.
I'M STAYING WITH MY HUSBAND.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.276
WHAT HUSBAND?

22:57.376 --> 22:59.178
HE'S COMING BACK, MAMA.

22:59.278 --> 23:02.314
FELIX, YOU'RE A MAN.
WOULD YOU GIVE YOUR DAUGHTER
THE FACTS OF LIFE?

23:02.415 --> 23:04.316
OH, WELL...

23:04.417 --> 23:05.718
WELL...

23:05.818 --> 23:08.455
IT HAS BEEN MORE
THAN A WEEK NOW, LIB.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.890
OH, YOU DON'T
KNOW NOTHING!

23:16.496 --> 23:20.633
I KNOW WHEN MY DAUGHTER'S
BEEN PLAYED A FOOL.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.869
IT'S BREAKING MY HEART
WATCHING HER LIKE THIS.

23:22.969 --> 23:26.038
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.174
THE TRUTH?

23:28.274 --> 23:29.976
WHAT TRUTH
IS THAT, MAMA?

23:30.076 --> 23:32.945
THE TRUTH THAT YOU'VE
BEEN MAD AT JONESY

23:33.045 --> 23:34.847
EVER SINCE HE CHUCKED YOU?

23:34.947 --> 23:37.584
HE DIDN'T CHUCK ME.
I CHUCKED HIM.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.886
- HEY, NOW--
- I WOULDN'T GO
SHOOTING MY MOUTH OFF

23:39.986 --> 23:43.723
- ABOUT SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.
- WE'S HUSBAND AND WIFE.

23:43.823 --> 23:47.760
WE TALK ABOUT
EVERYTHING, MAMA.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.899
YOU BETTER TAKE
YOUR BLINDERS OFF, GIRL.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.934
HE'S GONE.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.169
PROBABLY GOT HIMSELF
SOMEBODY NEW BY NOW,

23:57.269 --> 24:00.873
SOME NICE DECENT GIRL
WHO DOESN'T STRIP
FOR A LIVING.

24:00.973 --> 24:04.110
( scoffs )
I'M RIDING WITH SAMSON!

24:04.210 --> 24:06.713
( whining )
LIB, DON'T--

24:10.617 --> 24:14.153
- WHY'D YOU HAVE TO GO
AND SAY THAT?
- SHUT UP!

24:17.289 --> 24:19.626
( radio playing music )

24:21.093 --> 24:23.229
( door closes )

24:41.781 --> 24:44.083
IT IS A BIT OVERWHELMING.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.052
WHAT?

24:46.152 --> 24:47.253
BEING REBORN,

24:47.353 --> 24:50.557
RECEIVING SALVATION.

24:52.091 --> 24:56.028
A BODY FLOATED UP TO US
AT THE BAPTISM.

24:56.128 --> 24:58.230
A BODY?

24:58.330 --> 25:01.167
THEY SAID
IT WAS ELEANOR.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.036
ELEANOR McGILL?

25:04.136 --> 25:07.073
IT WAS HARD TO TELL.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.649
SOFIE?

25:29.128 --> 25:31.097
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

25:34.601 --> 25:37.236
SHE HAD WEEDS WRAPPED
AROUND HER ANKLES.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.653
SIT DOWN, DEAR.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.392
SHE MUST'VE
DROWNED SOMEHOW,

26:00.492 --> 26:03.229
LOST HER FOOTING
AND SLIPPED ON THE BANK.

26:03.329 --> 26:06.933
HOW AWFUL.

26:07.033 --> 26:10.002
BROTHER JUSTIN SAID
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.141
IT MUST'VE BEEN.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.777
THAT POOR WOMAN,

26:17.877 --> 26:21.047
TO HAVE TAKEN
HER OWN LIFE.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.351
DID JUSTIN
SAY THAT?

26:27.854 --> 26:30.657
HE SAID SHE MUST'VE
ENDURED GREAT SUFFERING

26:30.757 --> 26:34.093
TO HAVE THROWN AWAY
GOD'S GREATEST GIFT--

26:34.193 --> 26:37.797
THAT WE WERE BLIND
NOT TO HAVE SEEN IT.

26:41.567 --> 26:44.036
IT MUST'VE BEEN
SO DIFFICULT FOR HIM.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.874
I'M SURE IT WAS.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.379
HE IS A GOOD MAN.

27:19.038 --> 27:21.107
( sizzling )

27:22.574 --> 27:25.077
( gasps, groaning )

27:26.445 --> 27:28.380
( shouts )
IRIS!

27:30.182 --> 27:32.618
- WHAT IS IT?
- HOW DID THAT GET IN HERE?

27:32.719 --> 27:34.320
I DON'T KNOW!

27:34.420 --> 27:36.322
Justin:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T KNOW?

27:36.422 --> 27:39.391
- WEREN'T YOU HERE ALL DAY?
- YES, BUT I'M NOT A GUARD!

27:39.491 --> 27:41.828
( conversing in russian )

28:11.057 --> 28:14.927
IT MUST BE AWFUL CROWDED
UP IN THAT LEAD TRUCK JUST NOW.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.600
I WOULDN'T TRUST
THAT LITTLE SHRIMP AS FAR
AS I COULD THROW HIM.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.303
THIS JUST DOESN'T
FEEL RIGHT.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.774
TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

28:27.874 --> 28:29.809
NOTHING'S FELT RIGHT
SINCE DAMASCUS.

28:29.909 --> 28:32.812
I MEAN, LOOK AT US,

28:32.912 --> 28:35.915
DRIVING ALL NIGHT
JUST TO GET TO SOME
REVIVAL CAMP,

28:36.015 --> 28:38.918
PRACTICALLY STARVING.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.552
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT ALL THAT?

28:40.652 --> 28:44.056
I THINK IT'S A SHAME
WE CAN'T GET NOTHING
ON THIS RADIO.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.230
( scornfully )
"ASK MANAGEMENT."

28:51.330 --> 28:54.400
Y'ALL EVER SET EYES
ON MANAGEMENT?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.202
I SURE AS HELL NEVER HAVE.

28:56.302 --> 29:00.006
IF YOU ASK ME,
THERE IS NO MANAGEMENT,

29:00.106 --> 29:03.375
JUST A LITTLE MAN
WITH A SWOLLED HEAD.

29:03.475 --> 29:07.947
YOU'VE BEEN
SINGING THE SAME SONG
EVER SINCE LODZ DIED.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.082
THINGS KEEP GOING
THE WAY THEY'RE GOING,

29:10.182 --> 29:11.918
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
NO CARNIVAL

29:12.018 --> 29:15.021
LEFT TO MANAGE BY THE TIME
WE GET TO THE NEXT JUMP.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.292
( sniffing )

29:20.392 --> 29:22.094
RITA? RITA?

29:22.194 --> 29:23.462
RITA, BABY.

29:23.562 --> 29:27.299
SHE'S RIGHT.
IT'S ALL GOING TO SHIT.

29:28.667 --> 29:32.071
AND IT'S ALL THAT
LITTLE FUCKER'S FAULT!

29:34.941 --> 29:37.443
( horn beeping )

29:53.325 --> 29:56.228
YOU CAME BACK!

29:57.163 --> 29:59.866
I SAID I WOULD,
DIDN'T I?

30:21.687 --> 30:23.289
YOU KNOW, BABY,

30:23.389 --> 30:27.226
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
HAVE TO GET OVER HIM
ONE OF THESE DAYS.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.503
WHERE'S HAWKINS?

30:39.571 --> 30:42.174
HE'S AT THAT PREACHER'S CAMP.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.743
IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING
YOU EVER SAW.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.113
THE FELLA'S PRACTICALLY
GOT HIS OWN ARMY.

30:47.213 --> 30:50.917
IF HAWKINS MAKES A MOVE,
HE'LL GET HISSELF
KILLED FOR SURE.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.684
WE GOT TO GET
IN THERE.

30:52.784 --> 30:54.353
WELL, IT AIN'T
GONNA BE EASY.

30:54.453 --> 30:58.390
THEM DEVIL DODGERS
AIN'T GONNA WANT
OUR TYPE THERE.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.326
YOU LEAVE IT TO ME.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.261
I'LL DEAL WITH THAT.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.463
LET'S GET A MOVE ON.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.268
Justin:
EARL, LEROY,

31:09.368 --> 31:12.171
YOU TWO MEN WERE
GUARDING THE HOUSE
YESTERDAY?

31:12.271 --> 31:14.173
YES, SIR.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.175
OPEN THAT.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.892
WHAT IS THAT?

31:33.993 --> 31:36.562
HATCHET.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.931
A HATCHET?

31:39.598 --> 31:41.000
YES, SIR.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.734
ARE YOU SURE?

31:42.834 --> 31:45.204
PICK IT UP.

31:53.980 --> 31:56.949
PUT YOUR HAND DOWN
ON THAT TABLE.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.991
YOU SEE I FOUND THAT
ON MY PILLOW LAST NIGHT.

32:05.091 --> 32:08.827
THAT'S WHY I'M HAVING
SUCH A HARD TIME BELIEVING
THAT IT IS A HATCHET.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.896
PLEASE, UH--

32:10.997 --> 32:12.531
EARL.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.600
IS IT SHARP?

32:20.106 --> 32:23.442
I DIDN'T HEAR.
IS IT SHARP?

32:23.542 --> 32:25.644
IT'S SHARP.

32:25.744 --> 32:30.616
PERHAPS THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF GUARDING THIS HOUSE IS
TOO GREAT FOR YOU BOYS.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.018
NO.

32:32.118 --> 32:34.386
I'M SORRY,
BROTHER JUSTIN.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.255
I'M SORRY!

32:36.355 --> 32:38.224
- I'M SORRY.
- OH MY GOD!

32:38.890 --> 32:40.392
I'M SORR--

32:40.492 --> 32:43.062
( sobbing )

32:48.867 --> 32:51.537
I HAVE GREAT FAITH
IN YOU BOYS.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.373
DON'T DISAPPOINT ME AGAIN.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.608
NO, SIR.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.545
THANK YOU.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.688
THAT'S MINE.

34:16.788 --> 34:20.226
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THIS?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING GOING
THROUGH MY THINGS?

34:20.326 --> 34:21.960
- PUT IT BACK.
- WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

34:22.060 --> 34:23.862
- IT WAS SENT TO ME.
- BY WHOM?

34:23.962 --> 34:26.465
I HAVE NO IDEA.

34:30.836 --> 34:33.305
WAIT.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.108
YOU KNOW HIM,
DON'T YOU?

34:36.208 --> 34:38.977
YOU RECOGNIZE HIM.
WHO IS HE?

34:39.077 --> 34:41.380
TELL ME!

34:44.750 --> 34:47.653
I'M SORRY, SOFIE.

34:50.156 --> 34:53.259
IT'S JUST
THAT THIS BOY--

34:53.359 --> 34:57.796
HE'S A LOST SOUL...

34:57.896 --> 35:00.199
IN NEED OF GUIDANCE.

35:01.467 --> 35:04.670
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT HIM?

35:07.739 --> 35:09.241
HIS NAME IS BEN.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.710
I MET HIM ON THE ROAD.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.712
HE NEEDS MY HELP.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.282
WHERE IS HE NOW?

35:18.950 --> 35:21.253
I DON'T KNOW.

35:25.191 --> 35:27.293
WELL...

35:28.227 --> 35:31.297
IF YOU SEE HIM AGAIN...

35:34.966 --> 35:39.104
TELL HIM
THAT HE IS SAFE HERE,

35:39.205 --> 35:42.441
AND THAT I HAVE PRAYED
FOR HIS SOUL MANY TIMES,

35:42.541 --> 35:46.612
AND THAT THIS IS
WHERE HE BELONGS.

35:51.350 --> 35:54.386
YOU ARE A BLESSING
TO ME...

35:55.821 --> 35:57.823
DEAR SOFIE.

36:16.342 --> 36:19.411
SURE YOU WANT
TO DO THAT?

36:19.511 --> 36:21.447
Lila:
THIS ISN'T
NO CARNY CIRCUIT.

36:21.547 --> 36:24.416
Burley:
WE AIN'T BEEN ON
A CARNY CIRCUIT IN MONTHS.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.218
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

36:26.318 --> 36:27.719
STILL DRAG DOWN
ENOUGH TO EAT.

36:27.819 --> 36:30.256
DIFFERENCE IS,
ONE OF US GOT MURDERED.

36:30.356 --> 36:31.557
WHO KNOWS WHO'S NEXT?

36:31.657 --> 36:33.425
DON'T YOU TALK TO ME
ABOUT LODZ.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.294
HE WEREN'T
EXACTLY A SAINT.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.429
MAYBE HE WASN'T
YOUR BEST FRIEND,

36:37.529 --> 36:39.731
BUT THAT LITTLE BUGGER
HELPED DUST HIM.

36:39.831 --> 36:43.935
NOW HE'S GOT US ROLLING
INTO SOME COME-TO-JESUS
TENT TOWN,

36:44.035 --> 36:45.937
RUN BY A CRAZY
HALLELUJAH PEDDLER!

36:46.037 --> 36:49.174
Burley:
YEAH, AND WE JUST SUPPOSED
TO GO ALONG FOR THE RIDE?

36:49.275 --> 36:51.410
MANAGEMENT GOT
A REASON.

36:51.510 --> 36:56.948
MANAGEMENT?
ASK ME, MANAGEMENT
IS A SON-OF-A-BITCH.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.917
( rousties muttering )

37:00.085 --> 37:03.054
I DON'T THINK
YOU MEAN THAT, LILA.

37:03.154 --> 37:06.325
I MEAN THAT,
AND MORE.

37:06.425 --> 37:09.495
Iris:
MOST OF THE FAMILIES HERE
COME TO US

37:09.595 --> 37:12.564
WITH LITTLE MORE
THAN THE CLOTHES
ON THEIR BACKS.

37:12.664 --> 37:15.801
I WOULD IMAGINE
YOU CHARGE ADMISSION.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.604
WE DO.

37:18.704 --> 37:22.007
BUT WE HAVE
SOME LATITUDE ON THAT.

37:22.107 --> 37:27.346
I THINK IT WLD BE
SUCH A WONDERFUL THING
FOR THE CHILDREN HERE.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.080
BUT YOU HAVE OBLIGATIONS
TO YOUR COMPANY.

37:29.180 --> 37:33.319
YES, BUT WE LIKE
TO THINK OF OURSELVES
AS GOOD CHRISTIANS.

37:33.419 --> 37:36.688
SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE
TO PUT THE LORD FIRST.

37:36.788 --> 37:41.927
WELL, WHAT IF WE COULD
COMPENSATE YOU FOR
YOUR EFFORTS?

37:42.027 --> 37:46.565
UH, WE--
WE WOULDN'T BE ADVERSE
TO THAT, MA'AM.

37:46.665 --> 37:49.568
WE COULD GIVE YOU
AN HONORARIUM OF SORTS.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.236
UH...

37:51.337 --> 37:55.507
CASH MONEY IS WHAT
WE'RE MOSTLY USED TO.

37:55.607 --> 37:59.411
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.
FROM OUR EMERGENCY FUND.

38:02.213 --> 38:04.115
ALL RIGHTY.

38:04.215 --> 38:06.985
YOU GOT YOURSELF
A CARNIVAL, MISS CROWE.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.622
THANK YOU, MA'AM.

38:16.061 --> 38:19.998
HOW MANY OF YOU FOLKS
WANT TO GO ON TO SACRAMENTO?

38:20.098 --> 38:22.868
FORGET THIS MUD HOLE!

38:24.169 --> 38:25.671
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

38:25.771 --> 38:28.774
JONESY AND SAMSON
AIN'T BACK YET.

38:28.874 --> 38:31.443
AND BESIDES, YOU AIN'T
IN CHARGE, LILA.

38:31.543 --> 38:33.812
WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME
FOR A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP.

38:33.912 --> 38:36.281
YOU CAN'T JUST DECIDE THAT
ALL ON YOUR OWN.

38:36.382 --> 38:37.883
LIBBY'S RIGHT.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.686
WHAT THE HECK
DOES SHE KNOW?
SHE'S JUST A DUMB QUIFF.

38:40.786 --> 38:44.556
HEY! WATCH YOUR MOUTH,
YOU COWARDLY PIECE
OF SHIT!

38:44.656 --> 38:46.658
COWARDLY?
I COULD SNAP YOU
LIKE A DRIED TWIG.

38:46.758 --> 38:49.294
- YOU SON OF A BITCH.
- Ruthie: STOP IT,
BOTH OF YOU!

38:49.395 --> 38:51.830
THIS AIN'T SOLVING
ANY PROBLEMS.

38:51.930 --> 38:55.834
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN
BURLEY'S HARD-ON FOR LIBBY.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.437
HER?
I DON'T FUCK WHORES.

38:58.537 --> 39:01.873
THAT'S 'CAUSE THEY
WON'T FUCK YOU, BURLEY.

39:01.973 --> 39:05.977
WELL, LOOK AT WHO'S BACK.

39:29.968 --> 39:31.603
Samson:
GOOD NEWS!

39:31.703 --> 39:36.074
WE MADE A DEAL.
IT'S GONNA ALL WORK OUT.

39:42.113 --> 39:43.782
WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:43.882 --> 39:47.953
Lila:
WHILE YOU WAS GONE, WE ALL
HAD US A MEETING, SAMSON.

39:50.321 --> 39:51.957
YOU DID, HUH?

39:52.057 --> 39:53.559
MM-HMM.

39:53.659 --> 39:55.594
AND YOU'RE NOT
IN CHARGE NO MORE.

39:55.694 --> 39:58.163
Samson:
IT DON'T WORK
THAT WAY, LILA.

39:59.297 --> 40:01.867
MANAGEMENT
CALLS THE SHOTS.

40:01.967 --> 40:04.770
AIN'T NOTHING YOU, ME
OR ANYBODY CAN DO ABOUT IT.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.872
WHY SHOULD WE DO ANYTHING
MANAGEMENT WANTS?

40:06.972 --> 40:09.575
HE DON'T SEEM
TO GIVE TWO SHITS
ABOUT US!

40:09.675 --> 40:12.010
OR IF HE DOES,
WHY DON'T YOU GO
IN THERE,

40:12.110 --> 40:14.312
HAVE HIM COME OUT
AND TELL US THAT
HIMSELF?

40:14.412 --> 40:19.785
I'M SURE WE'D BE ALL
REAL INTERESTED TO HEAR
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

40:19.885 --> 40:23.522
- YEAH.
- ABOUT TIME
WE SAW HIS FACE.

40:23.622 --> 40:27.493
YOU KNOW MANAGEMENT
DON'T COME OUT.

40:27.593 --> 40:31.530
WELL THEN, MAYBE WE
OUGHT TO JUST GO IN.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.533
COME ON!

40:34.633 --> 40:37.503
FINE. LET'S GO.

40:38.904 --> 40:42.974
- SAMSON, WE GOT
TO DO SOMETHING.
- LET THEM GO.

41:03.729 --> 41:05.030
HELLO?

41:05.130 --> 41:07.165
ANYBODY HOME?

41:44.570 --> 41:46.738
THERE'S NOBODY IN THERE!

41:46.838 --> 41:49.608
THERE IS NO MANAGEMENT!

41:49.708 --> 41:51.810
( crowd chattering )

42:03.889 --> 42:07.158
- THERE AIN'T?
- NOT A SOUL.

42:08.093 --> 42:11.697
WELL, I'LL BE GODDAMNED.

42:12.731 --> 42:14.833
HE PASSED ON!

42:14.933 --> 42:17.035
IN DAMASCUS!

42:18.469 --> 42:20.105
ABOUT TIME YOU KNEW.

42:20.205 --> 42:23.174
YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH,
YOU BEEN LYING TO US
THIS WHOLE TIME!

42:23.274 --> 42:27.445
- HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW
THERE WAS A MANAGEMENT?
- YEAH?

42:27.545 --> 42:30.982
YOU JUST GOT
TO TRUST ME ON THIS.

42:31.082 --> 42:33.384
HE WAS A GOOD MAN!

42:33.484 --> 42:35.420
NOW WHAT?

42:35.520 --> 42:38.423
WE'VE GOT TO GET
TO NEW CANAAN.

42:38.523 --> 42:40.325
WE GOT TO SAVE HAWKINS.

42:40.425 --> 42:43.394
HAWKINS?
HE TOOK A POWDER DAYS AGO.

42:43.494 --> 42:46.197
NO, HE'S IN THERE.
AND HE NEEDS OUR HELP.

42:46.297 --> 42:48.867
Stumpy:
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, SAMSON?

42:48.967 --> 42:52.137
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
WE JUST GOT TO HELP HIM.

42:52.237 --> 42:54.740
HAWKINS?
THAT MURDERER?

42:54.840 --> 42:57.342
I'M NOT DOING
NOTHING FOR HIM.

42:57.442 --> 43:00.679
I'M WITH LILA.
HAWKINS AIN'T NEVER
DONE NOTHING FOR ME!

43:00.779 --> 43:03.682
I VOTE WE GO ON
TO SACRAMENTO!

43:03.782 --> 43:06.952
THAT'S IT, THEN.

43:07.052 --> 43:09.220
- SHOW THEM, JONESY.
- I CAN'T.

43:09.320 --> 43:10.789
I PROMISED HIM
I WOULDN'T.

43:10.889 --> 43:13.659
YOU GOT TO,
OR THEY'RE ALL GONNA GO!

43:17.528 --> 43:19.898
OKAY.

43:23.902 --> 43:28.073
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
HAWKINS DONE FOR ME?

44:21.326 --> 44:22.961
COLOSSUS WENT DOWN.

44:23.061 --> 44:26.431
THEM FELLAS FROM DAMASCUS
COME AFTER ME ONE NIGHT,

44:26.531 --> 44:28.800
TARRED AND FEATHERED ME,

44:28.900 --> 44:31.302
LEFT ME FOR DEAD.

44:31.402 --> 44:34.239
HAWKINS SAVED MY LIFE.

44:34.339 --> 44:36.742
BULLSHIT.

44:36.842 --> 44:40.712
WHEN HE HEALED ME,
HE HEALED THIS TOO.

44:48.486 --> 44:51.422
( crowd murmuring )

44:53.491 --> 44:56.661
Jones:
HAWKINS DONE THIS...

44:56.762 --> 44:59.030
FOR ME.

45:04.669 --> 45:08.039
HE AIN'T JUST SOME KID
FROM MILFAY.

45:15.781 --> 45:18.416
ANYBODY GOT ANY QUESTIONS?

45:25.023 --> 45:29.127
Justin:
DON'T.

45:29.227 --> 45:33.564
I DON'T BELIEVE NORMAN
NEEDS YOUR ASSISTANCE
TO EAT ANYMORE.

45:33.664 --> 45:36.167
DO YOU, NORMAN?

45:40.505 --> 45:42.107
ALL RIGHT.

45:42.207 --> 45:46.211
WHY DON'T YOU SIT OVER HERE,
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE?

46:01.326 --> 46:02.928
THERE.

46:03.028 --> 46:05.496
JUST LIKE A REAL FAMILY.

46:13.704 --> 46:17.275
- MORE MEAT?
- NO, THANK YOU.

46:21.112 --> 46:22.680
( telephone ringing )

46:22.780 --> 46:25.216
NOT HUNGRY TONIGHT,
NORMAN?

46:29.054 --> 46:31.289
Justin:
I'LL GET IT.

46:34.692 --> 46:37.228
( ringing continues )

46:49.240 --> 46:51.742
SOFIE,
CLEAR THAT PLATE.

46:51.843 --> 46:55.246
- ARE YOU SURE?
- I'M QUITE SURE.

47:01.152 --> 47:04.022
AND BRING SOME TEA
IN WITH YOU, PLEASE.

47:17.235 --> 47:19.270
NORMAN...

47:21.406 --> 47:25.911
DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT RIDICULOUS
FORTUNE-TELLER

47:26.011 --> 47:29.414
THAT JUSTIN BECAME
SO OBSESSED WITH

47:29.514 --> 47:31.282
IN ST. PAUL?

47:32.383 --> 47:37.022
WELL, UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM,
SHE HAD A BABY--

47:38.589 --> 47:40.858
A BABY GIRL.

47:55.473 --> 47:58.143
Sofie:
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

47:58.243 --> 48:01.312
OH NO, DEAR,
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.

48:04.649 --> 48:07.052
( thunder rumbling )

48:12.157 --> 48:14.492
( horse approaching )

48:17.028 --> 48:18.930
- ( thundering )
- ( whinnies )

48:19.030 --> 48:20.465
Man 3:
EARL! EARL, HELP!

48:20.565 --> 48:23.001
( horse whinnying )

48:47.025 --> 48:49.060
I WAS HOPING I'D FIND YOU
OUT HERE.

48:49.160 --> 48:51.696
Sofie:
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU NEED?

48:51.796 --> 48:54.265
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

48:58.336 --> 49:00.471
SPECTACULAR.

49:08.246 --> 49:10.215
JOIN ME.

49:26.998 --> 49:29.100
Sofie:
WHERE'S SISTER IRIS?

49:29.200 --> 49:31.736
Justin:
SHE'S IN BED.

49:35.340 --> 49:38.876
- I'VE BEEN
WATCHING YOU, SOFIE.
- YOU HAVE?

49:38.976 --> 49:41.746
YES, I HAVE.

49:44.115 --> 49:47.418
THERE'S SOMETHING
VERY SPECIAL ABOUT YOU.

49:47.518 --> 49:50.655
Justin:
INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING.

49:56.194 --> 49:58.563
BUT I--
( sighs )

49:59.264 --> 50:01.566
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

50:08.306 --> 50:10.175
I FEEL THAT YOU HAVEN'T

50:10.275 --> 50:12.710
QUITE SURRENDERED
TO THE CALL.

50:14.079 --> 50:17.248
THERE'S STILL
SOME DOUBT WITHIN YOU.

50:19.050 --> 50:21.452
SOFIE...

50:23.821 --> 50:26.057
YOU ARE SO FULL
OF LIGHT.

50:26.157 --> 50:27.658
IN THE BIBLE,

50:27.758 --> 50:34.031
WOMEN LIKE YOU ARE CALLED
THE HANDMAIDENS OF CHRIST.

50:34.965 --> 50:37.068
"ON MY HANDMAIDENS

50:37.168 --> 50:41.005
I WILL POUR OUT IN THOSE DAYS
OF MY SPIRIT;

50:41.106 --> 50:44.142
AND THEY WILL PROPHESY."

50:46.144 --> 50:49.214
WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT?

50:51.216 --> 50:53.484
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

50:53.584 --> 50:58.689
I WANT YOU TO BE PART
OF OUR FAMILY.

51:00.225 --> 51:02.527
I WANT YOU NEVER AGAIN

51:02.627 --> 51:05.029
TO BE ALONE...

51:05.130 --> 51:07.498
OR AFRAID.

51:11.035 --> 51:13.538
I SEE WHO YOU ARE.

51:26.951 --> 51:29.019
I'M SORRY.

51:29.120 --> 51:31.189
I CAN'T.

51:38.529 --> 51:40.698
( whispers )
DON'T. IT'S SUICIDE.

51:40.798 --> 51:42.200
( whispers )
I DON'T CARE.

51:42.300 --> 51:45.603
Jones:
NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

51:47.572 --> 51:50.341
SOFIE CAN TAKE CARE
OF HERSELF.

51:54.078 --> 51:56.714
OW, YOU'RE HURTING ME.

52:14.265 --> 52:16.301
GOOD EVENING.

52:58.509 --> 53:02.213
( carnival music playing )

53:03.013 --> 53:04.582
DAMN.

53:22.199 --> 53:24.469
Iris:
ISN'T IT LOVELY?

53:34.812 --> 53:36.514
IT WAS MY IDEA.

53:36.614 --> 53:40.451
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
A GREAT MORALE BOOST
FOR THE CHILDREN.

53:40.551 --> 53:44.589
REMEMBER HOW WE
USED TO LOVE IT SO
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG?

53:47.224 --> 53:51.262
OF COURSE YOU'RE RIGHT,
MY DEAR.

53:51.362 --> 53:54.465
Justin:
HOW VERY
THOUGHTFUL OF YOU.

54:12.517 --> 54:15.353
Justin:
"HE GATHERED THEM
TOGETHER INTO A PLACE

54:15.453 --> 54:18.756
CALLED ARMAGEDDON."

54:33.170 --> 54:36.474
( theme music playing )
