WEBVTT

00:16.375 --> 00:17.750
What did Hamish do?

00:17.750 --> 00:20.500
Is he gonna get
a new tractor?

00:20.500 --> 00:22.417
Yeah, well,
he probably shouldn't.

00:22.417 --> 00:23.792
He lives
in the city.

00:23.792 --> 00:25.625
No, it's not
that dangerous here.

00:25.625 --> 00:27.875
- I don't need a gun.
- Tell her it is
a bit dangerous.

00:27.875 --> 00:30.458
- Not all Americans have guns.
- Tell her Dave's got
a paintball gun.

00:30.458 --> 00:32.959
- Dave has a paintball gun.
- It's not a real gun, though.

00:32.959 --> 00:35.083
- Yeah, it's not real.
- Just shoots paint.

00:35.083 --> 00:37.333
I'm not gonna
get a gun, though.
I'm not getting--

00:37.333 --> 00:38.625
I've told you that. No.

00:38.625 --> 00:40.500
Tell her I'm thinking
about getting a gun.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.875
That's Bruce Willis,
though.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.458
Tell her about all
the TV stations here, Bret.

00:43.458 --> 00:45.792
- He's acting.
It's not real.
- Bret, the TV stations.

00:45.792 --> 00:48.166
- Tell her about
all the TV stations.
- Jemaine wants me to tell you

00:48.166 --> 00:50.417
there's a lot
of TV stations.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.709
What'd she say?

00:51.709 --> 00:53.792
- How many?
- I don't know.

00:53.792 --> 00:56.750
There's a lot.
Yeah yeah, no.
More than four.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.458
- Yeah.
- What'd she say?

00:58.458 --> 01:00.417
She says "wow."
Well, I'll talk to you soon.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.458
- Say bye for--
- Jemaine says "bye" as well.

01:02.458 --> 01:04.667
She says "bye."
Do you want to talk to her?

01:04.667 --> 01:06.625
- Nuh-uh.
- No.  Okay.

01:06.625 --> 01:08.792
All right, bye. Bye.

01:11.583 --> 01:14.333
- Who was that?
- It's Mom. She's good.

01:14.333 --> 01:17.291
( theme music
playing )

01:25.083 --> 01:26.875
( blows whistle )

01:48.208 --> 01:50.458
Murray:
Okay, guys,
band meeting.

01:50.458 --> 01:51.834
- Jemaine?
- Yes.

01:51.834 --> 01:53.500
- Yes?
- Yes.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.166
Bret?

01:55.166 --> 01:57.834
Murray, I was wondering
if you could call me by
my rapping name?

01:57.834 --> 01:59.959
- Your rapping name?
- Rhymenoceros.

01:59.959 --> 02:02.417
- Rhinoceros?
- The Rhymenoceros.

02:02.417 --> 02:04.500
Nah, well, that's not
gonna fit in here.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.083
I've got "Bret."
Can't you just have Bret
as your rapping name?

02:08.083 --> 02:10.083
No. It's not
a rapping name.

02:10.083 --> 02:11.750
It's a good
rapping name.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.583
"Hello, everybody,
I am Bret."

02:13.583 --> 02:15.667
- No.
- Rhymes with "wet" and...

02:15.667 --> 02:16.917
No, "Rhymenoceros."

02:16.917 --> 02:18.959
Look, if you're gonna have
some sort of rap name,

02:18.959 --> 02:20.625
just be careful you don't
do a drive-by.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.834
- I won't.
- Well, you'd better not.

02:22.834 --> 02:24.583
You know what
I mean by that?

02:24.583 --> 02:27.083
What about you, Jemaine?
Have you got a rapping name?

02:27.083 --> 02:29.583
Yeah,
"Hiphopopotamus,"

02:29.583 --> 02:31.667
but you can just call me
Jemaine if you want.

02:31.667 --> 02:34.083
Okay. Well,
let's go again.
Jemaine?

02:34.083 --> 02:35.959
- I just said
yes before.
- Yep.

02:35.959 --> 02:39.542
Okay, and what is it?
"Rhymenoceros."

02:40.542 --> 02:41.875
Mm-hmm.

02:41.875 --> 02:44.709
And Murray-- present.

02:44.709 --> 02:46.542
"Band agenda:

02:46.542 --> 02:48.750
item one, haircut."
Bret.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.750
- No, haven't had it done.
- Well, get it cut.

02:50.750 --> 02:53.583
I mean, you don't hear
of professional musicians
with long hair.

02:53.583 --> 02:56.750
- Well, Led Zeppelin?
- I mean a man.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.417
It needs a trim.

02:58.417 --> 02:59.834
Yours is
pretty long, Murray.

02:59.834 --> 03:03.417
"Item 2-A, gig."

03:04.709 --> 03:07.542
Oh, "a gig."
I'm gonna get
you guys another gig.

03:07.542 --> 03:08.917
What do you mean,
"another gig"?

03:08.917 --> 03:11.667
- Remember
the other one?
- Vaguely.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.792
Well, what about
another one?

03:13.792 --> 03:16.458
Murray, I was thinking
perhaps we could
do gigs at night?

03:16.458 --> 03:18.333
- No-- no, come on.
- Yes, most bands...

03:18.333 --> 03:20.125
- Most bands play
at night.
- Not again.

03:20.125 --> 03:21.875
- We've talked about this.
- Most bands play at night.

03:21.875 --> 03:23.375
It's too dangerous
out there at night.

03:23.375 --> 03:25.417
We go around walking around
at night all the time.

03:25.417 --> 03:28.250
Well, you know,
anything could happen.
You could get run over,

03:28.250 --> 03:32.000
pickpocketed, um,
fall down a manhole,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.041
bump into people,

03:34.041 --> 03:36.834
murdered--
imagine that--

03:36.834 --> 03:38.667
or even
just ridiculed.

03:38.667 --> 03:41.375
- We've never been
ridiculed.
- No.

03:41.375 --> 03:43.000
- You haven't?
- No.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.083
Well, that's a surprise.
I get ridiculed
all the time.

03:46.083 --> 03:47.458
- Really?
- Yup.

03:47.458 --> 03:50.917
"Oh hey,
ginger-balls."

03:50.917 --> 03:52.917
you know?

03:52.917 --> 03:55.542
That was Bret.

03:55.542 --> 03:57.625
- He called you that.
- The other night.

03:57.625 --> 03:59.250
Well, it's not
just you, Bret,

03:59.250 --> 04:01.834
it's all the time,
and it's not just
ginger-balls, you know?

04:01.834 --> 04:03.834
- I thought that was
your nickname?
- No.

04:03.834 --> 04:07.000
I get, "Oh, what are
you on your way to--

04:07.000 --> 04:08.458
a dick meeting?"

04:09.667 --> 04:11.542
Murray:
All right, here you are.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.834
You should wear
these T-shirts with
"New York" on them.

04:13.834 --> 04:16.291
All right,
just so you fit in.
Here's a hat.

04:16.291 --> 04:18.834
Put this on, all right?
"Hey, I'm walkin' here!"

04:18.834 --> 04:21.583
That's what they say when...
people get in the way,

04:21.583 --> 04:23.208
so there's the hats.

04:23.208 --> 04:24.917
You'll need a map.

04:24.917 --> 04:26.667
All right, take one
of those each.

04:26.667 --> 04:30.000
These are just
maps of New York.

04:31.250 --> 04:34.542
Keep them open.
Every time you stop
and get lost,

04:34.542 --> 04:36.333
you know where
you are.

04:36.333 --> 04:39.709
And these are
the safety reflective belts.
All right, they light up.

04:39.709 --> 04:41.667
I'm not gonna
wear that.

04:41.667 --> 04:44.834
- Yeah, you should.
- No, I'm not wearing it.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.792
- Well--
- Don't give it to me,
I'm not gonna wear it.

04:46.792 --> 04:48.458
Would you rather
get murdered?

04:49.667 --> 04:51.625
Come on.

04:56.917 --> 04:59.750
( Bret chattering )

04:59.750 --> 05:01.792
...'Cause he's down
in the hole doing nothing.

05:01.792 --> 05:03.709
- Whoa.
- All right, go.

05:03.709 --> 05:05.625
Did they
get him out or...?

05:05.625 --> 05:07.542
- Yeah, they got him out.
- Yeah.

05:07.542 --> 05:10.333
- Yeah, Justin found him.
- You got a cigarette?

05:10.333 --> 05:12.583
- Sorry, we don't smoke.
- Oh, that's too bad.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.750
Because my man Mickey here
wants a cigarette,

05:14.750 --> 05:16.875
so now you're gonna have
to give him some money.

05:16.875 --> 05:18.875
Oh-- We don't
have any money, man.

05:18.875 --> 05:21.709
Listen, you don't
want to mess with him,
because he's crazy, man,

05:21.709 --> 05:23.333
all right?
He's a psycho-killer.

05:23.333 --> 05:26.375
Qu'est-ce que c'est?
Give me some money.

05:26.375 --> 05:28.291
- Well, I've got $15.
- Okay, hand it over.

05:28.291 --> 05:30.625
No, but it's in the bank.
We'd have to go to the bank
to get it out.

05:30.625 --> 05:32.875
No, we don't have time
to go to the bank, dipshit.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.250
We might just
have time.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.959
Empty your pockets,
let's go.

05:35.959 --> 05:38.041
Give me what
you got.

05:38.041 --> 05:40.458
"Go to a bank."
Give me this.

05:40.458 --> 05:42.917
No-- no keys.
What is this?

05:42.917 --> 05:44.250
What the hell?

05:44.250 --> 05:46.166
Why-- why does the phone
have a camera glued to it?

05:46.166 --> 05:49.166
It's a camera phone.
Jemaine wanted one
for his birthday.

05:49.166 --> 05:50.792
Look at this.

05:50.792 --> 05:53.458
- Oh yeah?
Where'd you get it?
- I made it. It's homemade.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.000
Yeah, it's a piece
of shit.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.667
Well, how come Jemaine
likes it so much?

05:56.667 --> 05:58.917
- You can have it.
- No no, he doesn't want it.

05:58.917 --> 06:00.792
Yeah yeah, I'll keep it.
It's kind of interesting.

06:00.792 --> 06:02.417
- You like it?
- Yeah.

06:02.417 --> 06:04.500
- Give us the bike.
- Oh you don't need
the bike, man.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.417
- You got the camera phone.
- You'd better be careful,

06:06.417 --> 06:09.583
- because Bret knows karate.
- Yeah, I got a book
on karate.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.875
I haven't actually read
it yet, but I've got...

06:11.875 --> 06:14.500
Shut up, you English faggots,
and give me the bike!

06:14.500 --> 06:17.417
You'd better watch out.
You don't really know who
you're dealing with.

06:17.417 --> 06:20.625
Oh really?

are we dealing with?

to give us the bikes,

08:23.750 --> 08:25.458
you didn't listen,
so now this is happening.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.792
Mickey, show them
the knife.

08:29.458 --> 08:32.166
- That's not a knife.
- Yeah, that's a knife.

08:32.166 --> 08:34.208
Oh, it is a knife.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.208
Get 'em, get 'em.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.291
Get 'em!

Uh, Bret, my sleeve just--
help me,

09:04.792 --> 09:07.500
my sleeve's just caught
on the fence.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.125
I'm too scared, man.

09:10.125 --> 09:13.625
Bret, the corduroy's caught
on the fence, Bret.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.792
( pants )

09:24.792 --> 09:26.959
Oh, flub.

09:28.792 --> 09:31.083
We'd locked our bikes up,
and then the--

09:31.083 --> 09:33.125
the gang just
surrounded us.

09:33.125 --> 09:34.917
And suddenly, yeah,
they were everywhere--

09:34.917 --> 09:37.667
- We were around
here somewhere.
- Well, how many were there?

09:37.667 --> 09:40.542
- Bret: There was two of them.
- Two?  That's not a gang.

09:40.542 --> 09:42.417
- It was a two-man gang.
- Two-man gang.

09:42.417 --> 09:44.709
- Can you have that, David?
- Well, that's a pretty
small gang.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.000
I mean, technically,
the smallest gang possible.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.166
- Can you put
that gun down?
- Murray,

09:49.166 --> 09:51.166
it's a paint-pellet gun.
( chuckles )

09:51.166 --> 09:54.041
- Murray: Well,
what happened after that?
- Well, then we ran down here,

09:54.041 --> 09:56.834
they chased us
and Jemaine got-- got caught
on the fence.

09:56.834 --> 09:58.834
- What did Jemaine do then?
- Well, he was stuck on a--

09:58.834 --> 10:02.208
and then just going,
"Bret, help me, help me.
I'm stuck on the fence."

10:02.208 --> 10:03.917
- What happened
after that?
- Um...

10:03.917 --> 10:06.500
- I ran away.
- You just left him there

10:06.500 --> 10:07.917
to fight them himself?

10:07.917 --> 10:09.667
Well, I left him on the--
he was on the fence.

10:09.667 --> 10:12.417
- Bret!
- Well, I was--
I was very scared.

10:12.417 --> 10:14.125
- We were being mugged.
- Well, for a start,

10:14.125 --> 10:16.250
you could have told me
this two days ago
when it happened.

10:16.250 --> 10:18.375
Well, I just
thought he would have
come home by now.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.667
I mean, who knows what
could have happened to him?
He could be in hospital.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.834
A lot of New Zealanders
come over here

10:22.834 --> 10:24.250
and they come
into my office,

10:24.250 --> 10:26.208
and I give them the vest,
a map, and I tell them

10:26.208 --> 10:28.917
to stay clear
of crowds by going
through back alleys.

10:28.917 --> 10:31.000
Yet almost every day
a New Zealander is mugged.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.917
You just don't know.
You hear a lot of terrible
things happening.

10:33.917 --> 10:37.000
- He may be dead.
- He maybe did what?

10:37.000 --> 10:40.875
- He may be dead.
- Yeah, I know, but what
did he maybe do?

10:40.875 --> 10:42.125
He may be dead.

10:42.125 --> 10:44.125
Yeah, maybe he did,
maybe he didn't.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.750
- What did he maybe do?
- No, he may be dead.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.041
Are you guys
fucking with me?

10:48.041 --> 10:50.291
- What?
- Not alive.

10:50.291 --> 10:52.417
You know... dead.

10:52.417 --> 10:54.709
Oh. Oh.

10:57.583 --> 11:00.000
I can't believe that
he just ran off like that

11:00.000 --> 11:02.583
when the cops came
and left me there.

11:04.417 --> 11:08.959
Can you-- can you
believe that he would
just abandon me like that?

11:08.959 --> 11:11.917
That kind of thing,
it defines character.

11:11.917 --> 11:15.125
- Yeah.
- Son of a bitch.

11:15.125 --> 11:17.333
Yeah, you know, 'cause
you were deserted too.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.458
Huh? Anything could
have happened to you.

11:19.458 --> 11:20.917
I know.
You could have killed me.

11:20.917 --> 11:22.875
Could have
totally killed you.

11:24.291 --> 11:25.333
Is that what you--

11:25.333 --> 11:27.417
is that the kind
of thing you do?

11:27.417 --> 11:29.959
You... kill people?

11:29.959 --> 11:31.250
Maybe.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.917
Why, you ever
kill somebody?

11:35.166 --> 11:38.166
- Not really.
- No?

11:38.166 --> 11:39.917
Yeah, me neither.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.709
Killed a monkey once.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.333
Mmm. Uh-huh.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.417
Don't tell anybody
about that, okay?

11:51.417 --> 11:52.875
'Cause I'm not
proud of it.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.917
- Oh, I won't tell anyone.
- You'd better not.

11:54.917 --> 11:57.041
I won't.

11:57.041 --> 11:59.000
Define "not."

11:59.000 --> 12:02.625
Hey guys, remember
that time he got his
hand caught in that jar?

12:02.625 --> 12:03.917
What a dick.

12:03.917 --> 12:06.583
I mean, who gets
their hand caught in a jar?

12:06.583 --> 12:09.625
What a big
fucking asshole he was.

12:09.625 --> 12:11.500
- That was--
that was actually me.
- That was Bret.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.542
- Are you sure?
'Cause I thought--
- It was Bret, David.

12:14.542 --> 12:16.458
Jemaine was the one
who helped you out.

12:16.458 --> 12:19.333
And he helped you when
you got your head stuck
in the chair.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.041
- Remember?
- Yeah.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.458
You were there
for hours.

12:22.458 --> 12:25.291
He was just
a helpful guy,
you know?

12:25.291 --> 12:27.792
- Loyal.
- Yeah.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.750
Just hope
he's not dead.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.333
( mutters softly )

12:35.000 --> 12:37.834
There's still a chance
he's not dead.

12:37.834 --> 12:39.583
Hey, what was that
one thing he used to say?

12:39.583 --> 12:42.250
I mean, that
always cracked me up.
He'd be like--

12:42.250 --> 12:43.667
- He'd be like--
- What?

12:43.667 --> 12:46.000
Yeah, that's it.
He'd be like, "What?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.375
What? What?"

12:48.375 --> 12:51.333
You know, I never understood
a fucking word that guy said.

12:51.333 --> 12:53.542
- He did say "what" a lot.
- Bret: He did, he did, yeah.

12:53.542 --> 12:55.500
- "What?  What?"
- Bret: "What's going on?"

12:55.500 --> 12:56.917
- Yeah.
- "What."

12:56.917 --> 12:58.834
He listened,
he was just
always questioning.

12:58.834 --> 13:00.500
- "When? When?"
- "When, when?"

13:00.500 --> 13:03.542
"When are we
getting a gig?"

13:03.542 --> 13:05.500
I mean, so you can picture
the situation, right?

13:05.500 --> 13:07.500
I got Mickey's cousin
tied up in a chair,

13:07.500 --> 13:09.208
supposed to shoot him
in the kneecap,

13:09.208 --> 13:11.250
teach him some lesson,
you know?

13:11.250 --> 13:13.500
- About something.
- What-- what sort of thing?

13:13.500 --> 13:15.000
I don't know,
some family shit, you know?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.875
- Yeah.
- It's between them.
I don't ask.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.709
So anyway...
( imitates gunshot )
I shoot him.

13:18.709 --> 13:21.959
( clears throat )
Then I get a text--
this is 45 minutes later.

13:21.959 --> 13:23.667
Yeah, a text, mind you,
all right?

13:23.667 --> 13:26.208
Not a phone call--
"Oh, hey,

13:26.208 --> 13:28.208
by the way, John,
call it off."

13:28.208 --> 13:30.125
- That's terrible.
- Call the thing off.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.041
- After I--
after I did it.
- A text.

13:32.041 --> 13:34.709
Worst part,
he had known for two days
before he texted me.

13:34.709 --> 13:36.125
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:36.125 --> 13:37.834
So I got to untie
the guy, right?

13:37.834 --> 13:40.041
I got to apologize.
He's bleeding all
over the place,

13:40.041 --> 13:42.875
I got to help him.
It was very awkward shit.
I was very upset about it.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.375
I can imagine, John.
That sounds so--

13:44.375 --> 13:45.959
- That sounds terrible.
- It was horrible.

13:45.959 --> 13:49.000
- Bret did exactly that
same thing, actually.
- Really?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.208
Yeah, one time we were
supposed to go to the movies,

13:51.208 --> 13:54.375
- And-- Uh, "March
of the Penguins."
- Oh, I love that movie.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.125
And, he-- I had
bought the tickets,

13:56.125 --> 13:58.208
and he didn't turn up.
He texted me,

13:58.208 --> 14:00.041
said, "I'm not coming."

14:03.250 --> 14:06.542
Well, that's--
that's not really
the same thing,

14:06.542 --> 14:08.750
is it?
I mean...

14:08.750 --> 14:10.834
I-- I shot a guy,

14:10.834 --> 14:12.125
you know?

14:12.125 --> 14:14.750
Yours is worse.

14:21.291 --> 14:22.959
Excuse me, gentlemen?

14:22.959 --> 14:26.583
Your friend you
reported dead, we think
we might have found him.

14:26.583 --> 14:28.417
Now is he a guy
who wears glasses?

14:28.417 --> 14:29.917
- No.
- Yeah.

14:29.917 --> 14:32.917
- Yes.
- About 6'1,
6'2, Caucasian?

14:32.917 --> 14:34.583
He's from
New Zealand.

14:34.583 --> 14:37.875
Yeah, kind of
talks in a monotone,
sounds like a robot?

14:37.875 --> 14:39.375
Well, that's
the New Zealand accent.

14:39.375 --> 14:43.208
Right. Kind of sounds like,
"What? What, what?

14:43.208 --> 14:45.250
Don't poot me
in there weeth him.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.041
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent"?

14:47.041 --> 14:48.959
- Yes, that's definitely him.
- That's him.

14:48.959 --> 14:51.291
It's a little bit more
sort of South African.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.625
Think we might need
to see him visually.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.166
Sure.

14:56.583 --> 14:57.917
( door closes )

14:57.917 --> 15:00.750
Is she gonna
bring the body out here?

15:12.125 --> 15:14.417
- You okay?
- Yes.

15:14.417 --> 15:17.583
- You're acting
a little bit weird.
- No, I'm not.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.250
- You are.
- No, I'm not.
This is what I'm like.

15:20.250 --> 15:21.834
You're annoyed.

15:21.834 --> 15:24.166
No.

15:24.166 --> 15:26.333
Is it 'cause I ate
the last of your muesli?

15:26.333 --> 15:28.417
No.

15:28.417 --> 15:30.208
Because they took
your camera phone?

15:30.208 --> 15:33.417
No, it's not 'cause
they took the camera phone.

15:33.417 --> 15:35.542
'Cause I rented your half
of the apartment out to Rueben?

15:35.542 --> 15:37.417
Does he have to
stay here still?

15:37.417 --> 15:38.875
Well, he's paid
two weeks' rent,

15:38.875 --> 15:41.000
'cause I didn't think
you were coming back.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.125
No, he's okay.

15:43.125 --> 15:45.709
Is it because I ran away
when we were being mugged

15:45.709 --> 15:46.917
and left you with
guys with a knife?

15:46.917 --> 15:49.417
- Yes, actually. Yes.
- Oh, okay.

15:49.417 --> 15:51.291
I knew it, yeah.

15:52.834 --> 15:55.250
Well, it was a high-pressure
situation, man.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.333
I had to-- you know,
I had to make a decision.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.000
You would have
done the same thing.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.709
I wouldn't have.
You abandoned me.
You left me to die.

16:01.709 --> 16:04.208
I wouldn't have done it
if I'd known you were
gonna hassle me about it.

16:04.208 --> 16:05.625
You shouldn't have
done it anyway.

16:05.625 --> 16:07.250
- Hassling me.
- I'm not hassling you.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.917
- You are hassling me.
- I'm just pointing out

16:08.917 --> 16:11.166
that when you're
in a situation where
you're being mugged,

16:11.166 --> 16:13.709
- you shouldn't leave
your friend to die.
- Hassling me.

16:13.709 --> 16:17.041
- Height of rudeness.
- Okay, David Hassle-hoff.

16:23.542 --> 16:25.917
Oh my God.
Jemaine, are you okay?

16:25.917 --> 16:27.542
- Yeah.
- You're out?

16:27.542 --> 16:30.166
- Mm-hmm.
- Did the cops try
to strip search you?

16:30.166 --> 16:32.750
- No.
- Did they find anything?

16:32.750 --> 16:34.917
No, they didn't
strip search me.

16:34.917 --> 16:36.834
Oh, I-- I thought
you said they did.

16:36.834 --> 16:38.208
- No.
- Oh.

16:38.208 --> 16:40.250
Well, did any
of your cellmates, you know,

16:40.250 --> 16:42.125
- rape you in the--
- No. No no no.

16:42.125 --> 16:45.583
Oh good, good. 'cause if--
if I was a convict,

16:45.583 --> 16:47.625
you know, and I was in a cell
with a pretty boy like you,

16:47.625 --> 16:51.208
I would definitely
wait till lights out, put
my hand over your mouth--

16:51.208 --> 16:52.667
I've gotta--
I've gotta go.

16:52.667 --> 16:55.250
Oh, you're kind of
like a convict now.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.166
Makes you seem
so dangerous,

16:57.166 --> 16:59.250
like you could
just do anything.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.583
He was only in there
for two days.

17:00.583 --> 17:03.709
Bret, I know
what you did. Mmm?

17:03.709 --> 17:07.542
Being in jail just
makes you seem so sexy.

17:07.542 --> 17:10.959
I guess it's
the danger aspect.
( laughs )

17:10.959 --> 17:13.000
What are you
gonna do to me?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.125
Do it!
No, don't, don't.

17:15.125 --> 17:16.750
- See you guys later.
- See ya.

17:16.750 --> 17:19.875
Oh, yeah,
just run, Bret.
Just run.

17:19.875 --> 17:22.750
It's like Bonnie
and Clyde, you know.
They would rob banks,

17:22.750 --> 17:24.375
and then they
would do each other.

17:24.375 --> 17:26.041
Actually, I've-- I've
got to go too.

17:26.041 --> 17:28.250
I've got to go to
the same meeting as Bret.

17:28.250 --> 17:31.000
Oh, okay.
They'd get off on it.

17:32.291 --> 17:34.083
- Murray: Jemaine?
- Yes.

17:34.083 --> 17:36.041
- Bret?
- Um, Rhymenoceros.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.750
- Rhymenoceros, yep.
- Yep, present.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.792
- That's not a real
gangster name.
- What?

17:39.792 --> 17:42.625
- And Murray.
- Well, I've been
on the inside,

17:42.625 --> 17:45.041
I know what sort
of names gangsters have.

17:45.041 --> 17:46.500
Like John.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.917
There was another guy
there-- Ralph.

17:47.917 --> 17:50.041
Well, you were only
in there for two days, man.

17:50.041 --> 17:52.417
Hey, guys,
what's going on here?

17:52.417 --> 17:53.959
Well, Jemaine just
keeps on hassling me

17:53.959 --> 17:55.959
about how I abandoned him
when we got mugged.

17:55.959 --> 17:58.083
And why are you
angry with him?

17:58.083 --> 17:59.375
Well, he left me
to die.

17:59.375 --> 18:02.083
Yeah well,
we all know that.
Old news.

18:02.083 --> 18:03.542
No one likes
a moaner.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.583
Yeah well,
he just keeps on
going on about it.

18:05.583 --> 18:07.834
And having said that,
no one likes an abandoner
either, Bret.

18:07.834 --> 18:11.000
Now you don't
abandon each other in
life-threatening situations.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.125
- Okay.
- What happens is the guy
who's left behind--

18:14.125 --> 18:16.667
Jemaine-- may feel
left behind.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.709
Yeah?
Abandonment issues.

18:18.709 --> 18:21.041
Not only that, but he could
be seriously injured.

18:21.041 --> 18:24.000
- You were just lucky.
- Well, I wasn't that lucky.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.917
Well, they said
you didn't need that.

18:25.917 --> 18:27.458
I don't-- I don't
trust him anymore.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.500
- Oh, you don't mean that.
- Yeah? What do I mean?

18:29.500 --> 18:33.166
- Calm down, Jemaine!
- Sorry, if I can't trust
him on the streets,

18:33.166 --> 18:35.458
I can't trust him
on the stage.

18:35.458 --> 18:37.000
I can't do
another gig with him

18:37.000 --> 18:39.166
without going against
everything I stand for.

18:39.166 --> 18:41.000
Well, what if you
actually had another gig?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.792
- Well, then I would.
- Yeah?

18:42.792 --> 18:45.375
- Mmm.
- I haven't actually
got you one,

18:45.375 --> 18:47.125
but that's good to know.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.709
You know, I'm always
trying to get you gigs.

18:49.709 --> 18:52.250
All right?

18:52.250 --> 18:54.250
What's this meeting
about?

18:54.250 --> 18:57.000
Well, one of
my CDs is missing.

19:00.125 --> 19:04.000
So your friend--
your best friend
in the whole world

19:04.000 --> 19:07.125
just left you
there with a bunch
of crazy-ass muggers?

19:07.125 --> 19:09.750
- Hey. Oh.
- Shh.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.083
Were you scared?

19:11.083 --> 19:14.917
Uh, yeah-- yeah, I guess I was
kind of scared, right?

19:14.917 --> 19:16.291
- Sort of.
- Yeah.

19:16.291 --> 19:18.583
But, then again,

19:18.583 --> 19:20.875
- I wasn't scared.
- Oh wow.

19:20.875 --> 19:23.667
I just can't believe
a friend would do that.
What a douche bag.

19:23.667 --> 19:26.542
I know.
What a douche bag.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.709
John:
Can't believe what
you did, man.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.417
You leave
your best friend

19:30.417 --> 19:32.917
with a couple of hoodlums
who are about to mug him?
That's cold.

19:32.917 --> 19:36.375
But to be fair
to Bret, John, you were
one of those hoodlums

19:36.375 --> 19:38.208
- mugging us, you know?
- Yeah.

19:38.208 --> 19:39.875
Yeah, that's true.

19:39.875 --> 19:42.250
I guess I am somewhat
to blame as well, huh?

19:42.250 --> 19:45.208
- But it's still
shitty, what he  did.
- Yes, I agree with that.

19:45.208 --> 19:47.875
It's still very much
shitty, what you did, Bret.

19:47.875 --> 19:50.333
Okay, because to abandon
someone like that

19:50.333 --> 19:53.166
really sucks, man.
It hurts.

19:53.166 --> 19:55.417
At least I didn't
kill a monkey.

19:57.917 --> 19:59.250
Dawg.

20:03.458 --> 20:06.250
- Okay, this is
gonna work.
- Hey.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.250
He's really sorry.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.834
Brought you
a cup of tea, man.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.250
- No, thank you, Bret.
- Please grab it,
it's hot.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.208
- It's hot.
- Deal with it yourself.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.291
That's what I've learned
to do the hard way.

20:16.291 --> 20:19.458
Oh, ow ow ow-- oh, fuck! Ow.

20:19.458 --> 20:21.959
Ow ow! Ah ah!

20:21.959 --> 20:23.959
I guess
we're even then.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.792
Jemaine, I made you
some pizza.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.917
I'm not hungry!

20:30.125 --> 20:31.583
( ringing )

20:31.583 --> 20:34.458
Hey, man, I met you
the other day when
you mugged me.

20:34.458 --> 20:37.834
Umm, the bike and
the camera phone that
you're talking to me--

20:37.834 --> 20:39.917
Yeah yeah.
The one that ran away.

20:39.917 --> 20:42.125
Yeah. Look,
I'm wondering if
there's a chance

20:42.125 --> 20:43.959
I could get
the phone back.

20:46.125 --> 20:48.667
Hey, Jemaine,
I'll see you later, maybe.

20:48.667 --> 20:51.709
- Bye, Bret.
- If I live, that is,
'cause I might get killed.

20:51.709 --> 20:54.959
Okay, let me know
how that goes. C-10.

20:54.959 --> 20:56.041
Hit.

20:56.041 --> 20:57.875
Yes.
What, sorry?

20:57.875 --> 20:59.500
I'm going to get
your camera phone back.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.500
If I die, I want you
to tell my mom.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.291
Okay. Well, write--
write down her address.

21:04.291 --> 21:07.000
Write it down
on that piece of paper.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.750
B-10.

21:09.750 --> 21:12.500
Well, just phone--
you can just phone her
and tell her.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.250
Oh, okay,
I'll just phone her.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.417
'Cause I might
not come back.

21:16.417 --> 21:18.333
Okay.

21:20.291 --> 21:23.291
So this is it, man.
I'm going to get
your camera phone now.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.625
- You don't need to
go and do that.
- Yes, I do.

21:25.625 --> 21:28.250
- No, you don't.
- Well, you loved
that thing.

21:28.250 --> 21:31.166
Yeah, I didn't really
love that camera phone

21:31.166 --> 21:33.208
as much as you
thought  I loved it.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.834
In fact, I kind of think
you ruined my phone

21:35.834 --> 21:39.500
when you made me
that camera phone.
And my camera.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.834
I see what you're doing.
No way, man.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.875
I'll get it for you.

Hey, you guys.

24:22.667 --> 24:25.542
It's me, one of the guys
who mugged you last week?

24:25.542 --> 24:27.041
The camera phone?
We talked on the phone...?

24:27.041 --> 24:29.000
Oh yeah yeah yeah.
Yeah hey, how's it going?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.125
You know, not good.

24:30.125 --> 24:32.208
Um, do you have
the camera phone?

24:32.208 --> 24:34.208
Yeah.
Here it is.

24:36.125 --> 24:38.709
Here are the photos--
I got 'em developed.

24:38.709 --> 24:40.542
From the camera phone.

24:40.542 --> 24:42.709
You guys had
some really good times, huh?

24:42.709 --> 24:44.041
Ah.

24:44.041 --> 24:46.041
I hope you don't mind,
there's some of me in there.

24:46.041 --> 24:47.709
I had to
finish out the roll.

24:47.709 --> 24:49.709
That's me
on a roller coaster.

24:49.709 --> 24:51.709
What's that one?
It's me with a shopkeeper,

24:51.709 --> 24:54.875
pointing--- pointing a gun.
Actually, I should take that.

24:54.875 --> 24:57.041
- Well, thanks.
- Yeah, thanks, man.

24:57.041 --> 24:58.792
Hey, how's John?

24:58.792 --> 25:00.375
We don't really
talk much anymore.

25:00.375 --> 25:01.834
Oh, yeah.
You don't see him?

25:01.834 --> 25:04.250
Yeah, I've seen him--
he's over there.

25:04.250 --> 25:06.625
We're not really
friends though, anymore.

25:06.625 --> 25:08.542
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, he--

25:08.542 --> 25:11.083
he couldn't really
forgive me for running
out on him like that.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.417
You know?

25:12.417 --> 25:14.583
I should have stuck
with him and saw it through.

25:14.583 --> 25:15.625
Yeah.

25:15.625 --> 25:17.542
We had these really
big plans, you know?

25:17.542 --> 25:20.083
We were
gonna go uptown,

25:20.083 --> 25:21.542
kidnap a rich kid,

25:21.542 --> 25:24.625
and ransom him
and-- yeah.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.625
None of that's
really gonna happen now.

25:26.625 --> 25:29.750
- That's a real shame.
- Yeah, it is.

25:29.750 --> 25:31.500
- We'll probably
see you around, so...
- Yeah.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.709
- Is this where
you usually mug?
- Usually, um...

25:33.709 --> 25:35.583
I've been too depressed
to work recently.

25:35.583 --> 25:38.792
I just wish John was
big enough to accept
my apology, you know?

25:40.083 --> 25:41.792
Well man, we're gonna
get some pizza.

25:41.792 --> 25:44.375
Do you want
to come and get a slice
of pizza or something?

25:44.375 --> 25:47.125
- Yeah? Really?
Oh, I'd love to, man.
- Yeah, okay.

25:47.125 --> 25:50.291
Um, I'm going to
a white supremacist gig.

25:50.291 --> 25:53.000
- It's gonna be awesome.
- Oh yeah?

25:53.000 --> 25:55.667
Well, we'll probably just
get the pizza.

25:55.667 --> 25:58.250
- Mickey?
- Hey, man.

25:58.250 --> 25:59.625
Bret.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.792
Hey, John.

26:01.792 --> 26:04.208
- Jemaine.
- John.

26:04.208 --> 26:06.291
Mickey, uh...

26:06.291 --> 26:08.583
you wanna hang out?

26:09.834 --> 26:11.959
Sure, man.

26:16.125 --> 26:18.125
Man, this whole week's
been terrible.

26:18.125 --> 26:20.625
I haven't felt this bad
since Cheeky died.

26:20.625 --> 26:22.959
Man, I miss that monkey.

26:26.583 --> 26:28.834
