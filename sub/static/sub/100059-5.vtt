WEBVTT

00:04.830 --> 00:07.094
- And while
it is wildly unconventional,

00:07.137 --> 00:08.660
there's nothing in the manual

00:08.704 --> 00:11.011
against wearing
a blue polo with a blue vest.

00:11.054 --> 00:12.447
- It ain't natural.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.275
- Okay, ten minutes
is enough on this.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.798
We still have a lot to do
for our health and safety

00:15.841 --> 00:17.321
inspection on Friday.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.149
Marcus, can you please
make sure your guys

00:19.193 --> 00:21.586
store all the new inventory
according to code?

00:21.630 --> 00:24.024
Could we just have one day

00:24.067 --> 00:25.329
without trucks to unload?

00:25.373 --> 00:27.288
- No--you work in a warehouse.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.377
I'm sorry,
that's your whole job.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.379
- Fake apology--not accepted.
- Okay, that's fine.

00:31.422 --> 00:33.511
Glenn, you're our
emergency captain, so...

00:33.555 --> 00:36.253
- Come on, Glenn--you, too?

00:36.297 --> 00:37.863
- Oh, no, I just have
a really bad headache.

00:37.907 --> 00:40.083
You know, the kind
where your body tingles

00:40.127 --> 00:42.390
all over
and your lungs shrink...

00:42.433 --> 00:45.262
- Oh, my butt tingles
when I sit for too long.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.569
- I'm thirsty.
I'm gonna get some water.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.092
- Glenn, why don't you sit down

00:49.136 --> 00:50.702
and someone else
can get you water?

00:50.746 --> 00:54.271
- No, Glenn, that's not--
you're--that's my phone.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.056
- Stop! Glenn, stop, please.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.535
- What--just go on
with the meeting.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.885
I'm just gonna
have a little fall.

01:09.286 --> 01:12.724
- Glenn--are you okay?
We were so worried.

01:12.768 --> 01:15.423
But then Earl egged
Sarah's car, so a lot of people

01:15.466 --> 01:17.207
kind of moved over to that.

01:17.251 --> 01:19.035
- Oh, yeah, no, I am fine.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.472
In fact, I'm not
pre-diabetic anymore.

01:21.516 --> 01:23.387
- You're cured?
How's that possible?

01:23.431 --> 01:24.649
- Oh, no I'm not cured.

01:24.693 --> 01:26.651
I'm just completely
diabetic now.

01:26.695 --> 01:28.914
I bonked out because
my body thought that I had

01:28.958 --> 01:30.264
too much sugar
in my bloodstream.

01:30.307 --> 01:32.135
Agree to disagree.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.094
But anyway, my doctor says
I can manage it all

01:34.137 --> 01:36.052
with just a few
tweaks to my lifestyle.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.749
- Tweaks?
You face plant

01:37.793 --> 01:40.056
in the break room and your
doctor prescribes tweaks?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.362
- Not bad, huh?

01:41.405 --> 01:43.146
Looks like I picked
the right doctor.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.192
- How could he not
notice your patchy skin,

01:45.235 --> 01:47.107
your weight gain,
how your breath smells

01:47.150 --> 01:49.326
like a Jolly Rancher no matter
what you've just eaten?

01:49.370 --> 01:51.241
- Hey, Jerusha loves that.

01:51.285 --> 01:54.114
Every morning she asks me
to breathe into her car.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.854
- Okay...tweaks
aren't gonna cut it.

01:55.898 --> 01:58.379
You need to do a complete
lifestyle overhaul.

01:58.422 --> 02:00.598
I carried your baby for nine
months and I'm not gonna let

02:00.642 --> 02:02.252
her get abandoned
the way I did.

02:02.296 --> 02:03.949
It's not fun going
to a baseball game

02:03.993 --> 02:05.690
with your principal
or learning how to skip stones

02:05.734 --> 02:07.431
from a pamphlet
you had to send away for.

02:07.475 --> 02:10.086
- I am not going
to abandon Rose.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.002
The Sturgises
all live into their 90s.

02:13.045 --> 02:16.179
We have kind of a deal...

02:16.223 --> 02:19.313
Anyway, I'm gonna be fine.
Hey, Masoud!

02:19.356 --> 02:21.663
Guess who's not
pre-diabetic anymore!

02:23.491 --> 02:25.275
- So they finally got
the sprinklers working

02:25.319 --> 02:27.364
for the inspection,
but I didn't get home

02:27.408 --> 02:29.627
until 3:00 a.m.,
and then Parker was awake...

02:29.671 --> 02:31.629
- I know, I'm so sorry.
I tried to put him back down,

02:31.673 --> 02:34.241
but I think he finds
my stories too stimulating.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.025
- What is this?

02:36.068 --> 02:39.289
I--I asked you to put
up the Halloween decorations.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.204
- You said St. Patrick's Day.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.684
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry guys.

02:42.727 --> 02:45.382
This is my bad.
I'm really tired.

02:45.426 --> 02:47.210
Can you please just
make this into Halloween?

02:47.254 --> 02:49.386
Come on.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.345
I just got all this
stuff out of storage.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.999
I saw a bunch of silverfish.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.958
- You need to get more sleep.

02:56.001 --> 02:59.614
- Oh, my God, did you just come
up with that all by yourself?

02:59.657 --> 03:02.399
Are you a doctor?
'Cause I might just take a nap

03:02.443 --> 03:05.620
right now, Mr. Sleep Doctor.

03:05.663 --> 03:08.797
- I know you said that with
a nuclear level of sarcasm,

03:08.840 --> 03:11.452
but I think you could
actually take a nap.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.280
- Just in the middle
of my work day?

03:13.323 --> 03:15.804
- You're ready for
the inspection tomorrow.

03:15.847 --> 03:18.807
- I can't just take a...
I mean, of course I want to...

03:18.850 --> 03:20.983
Oh, my God, why did you
even say the word nap?

03:21.026 --> 03:23.855
I can now feel my whole
body just shutting down.

03:23.899 --> 03:27.337
No--I am not gonna take a nap.
I'm gonna...

03:27.381 --> 03:29.209
where am I going?

03:30.819 --> 03:32.908
I was probably
going to my office.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.214
I'll just start there.

03:35.824 --> 03:37.739
- So you might be working
with Dan the optometrist?

03:37.782 --> 03:39.784
Weird dude.

03:39.828 --> 03:42.004
- I don't even care.
They can hire me because

03:42.047 --> 03:43.571
it's run by a separate company.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.529
Kind of like with
Dolly Parton and her husband,

03:45.573 --> 03:47.662
who live under the same roof
but never talk to each other.

03:47.705 --> 03:49.881
- Right, like that.
- But it doesn't matter.

03:49.925 --> 03:52.275
These interviews all
go the same way anyway.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.277
I slay with the Q&A,
it's electric...

03:54.321 --> 03:56.584
then they ask for my Social
and I go, "I don't have one."

03:56.627 --> 03:59.021
Then they go, "Thanks,
we'll be in touch."

03:59.064 --> 04:00.762
Guess if they're ever
in touch, Garrett.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.067
- It's pretty clear
from the context.

04:02.111 --> 04:04.113
- They're not!
They're never in touch.

04:11.816 --> 04:14.297
- How did Elias get locked
in the storm shelter?

04:14.341 --> 04:16.299
- Uh, I think he went
in there to sneak beans.

04:16.343 --> 04:19.128
- That's weird--he eats beans
out in the open all the time.

04:19.171 --> 04:21.086
It's not even locked.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.176
- It's a Nap Attack.
- Welcome to the Nap Zone.

04:24.220 --> 04:25.917
Cheyenne,
we agreed on Nap Zone.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.223
- You agreed on it.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.139
- You guys...
- Just a 15 minute power nap.

04:30.182 --> 04:33.098
Look, I've recreated
your ideal sleep scenario.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.709
Okay so warm light,

04:34.752 --> 04:36.624
one pillow for your head,
one pillow to hug.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.887
A laptop cued
to the 11 o'clock news...

04:38.930 --> 04:41.411
- Oh, and here's my night
guard, in case you need it.

04:41.455 --> 04:44.588
- Um...no, thank you.

04:44.632 --> 04:47.548
Guys...I'm the manager
of the store.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.463
I can't take a nap.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.291
- Oh, come on.
You need to recharge a little.

04:51.334 --> 04:52.596
You don't wanna
end up collapsing

04:52.640 --> 04:54.381
in the store like Glenn.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.774
- Yeah, or, like,
falling asleep on the toilet

04:56.818 --> 04:58.646
with your underwear
around your ankles,

04:58.689 --> 05:00.952
so when we find you,
it looks like you passed out

05:00.996 --> 05:03.520
from pooing too hard,
and then every time we look

05:03.564 --> 05:05.305
at you we're gonna think,
"Oh, my God, that's the lady

05:05.348 --> 05:08.177
that pooed so hard
she passed out."

05:08.220 --> 05:10.266
Is that what you want?

05:10.310 --> 05:14.009
- No, I--I honestly can't say
that I want any of that.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.532
- Mm-hmm.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.926
I really do need it.

05:17.969 --> 05:20.232
Okay, I'm gonna take a nap.
- Yes!

05:20.276 --> 05:22.365
- Yes!
You just got nap trapped.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.933
- In--in the Nap Zone, right.
Yeah.

05:28.589 --> 05:31.548
- What the...
Hey!

05:31.592 --> 05:33.507
Grilled chicken
is on the list of approved

05:33.550 --> 05:35.073
foods from my doctor!

05:35.117 --> 05:36.945
- The doctor that
probably gets free vacations

05:36.988 --> 05:38.425
courtesy of Big Chicken.

05:38.468 --> 05:39.948
You're a vegan now.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.776
I got you a kale salad
from the cafÃ©.

05:41.819 --> 05:44.474
- Dina, look,
I appreciate your concern,

05:44.518 --> 05:46.868
but I can take care
of my own health.

06:00.185 --> 06:02.449
There.
Good as new.

06:02.492 --> 06:05.365
- Well you're clearly qualified
and I've always thought

06:05.408 --> 06:06.931
you were one
of the coolest guys here.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.672
You waved at me once,
do you remember?

06:08.716 --> 06:12.154
- Yes, of course.
Yeah.

06:12.197 --> 06:14.896
I was like--
and you were like...

06:14.939 --> 06:17.072
- Yeah, exactly.
Yes, right.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.421
Well, anyway.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.510
You got the job.
Can you start today?

06:20.554 --> 06:22.817
- Yes, definitely!
I'd love to.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.732
- Great,
I'll show you the ropes.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.864
Oh, my God--that's just
a figure of speech,

06:26.908 --> 06:28.823
you know that, right?
There's no ropes.

06:28.866 --> 06:30.781
- Got that.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.566
Uh, don't you need
my info, though?

06:32.609 --> 06:34.785
- Oh, whoops!
How silly of me.

06:34.829 --> 06:37.745
I completely forgot to do
any sort of paperwork.

06:37.788 --> 06:39.529
I didn't really forget.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.966
It's because
you're undocumented.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.316
- Oh.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.840
So, you know.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.537
- Know what?

06:47.581 --> 06:49.670
Did you see
the--the wink I did?

06:49.713 --> 06:52.977
- Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.936
You really are doing
a great thing for me.

06:54.979 --> 06:57.765
- I know.
I read this thing online

06:57.808 --> 07:01.551
about "white savior complex,"
and I guess that's me.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.423
- Did you read the whole thing?
- Wow.

07:03.466 --> 07:06.730
Dan, the White Savior.
Wow.

07:07.557 --> 07:09.429
- Wow, yeah.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.909
- Amy...time to wake-y.
- Hey, hey, hey.

07:11.953 --> 07:15.609
She really needs this and we
can cover for her, right?

07:15.652 --> 07:17.349
Plus, you know,
waking someone up in the middle

07:17.393 --> 07:19.090
of a REM cycle
can be very jarring.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.570
- I get it.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.616
Bo's the same way
with his soup.

07:22.659 --> 07:25.575
He's always like, "I gotta
finish this round of soup!"

07:25.619 --> 07:27.447
- Yeah, yeah.
It's the same thing.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.895
- Pretty good, right?
- I don't know...

07:40.938 --> 07:43.506
I'm not sure how often
Amy stands motionless

07:43.550 --> 07:45.769
with her face against the door.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.510
- Oh.
- No, no, no, no.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.817
- Amy Sosa speaking.
- What are you doing?

07:49.860 --> 07:51.993
- Absolutely.
- Is Amy in?

07:52.036 --> 07:53.821
- Uh, yes,
she just stepped out.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.257
Tell them you'll
call them back.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.867
- She wanted me to put
in a display for some

07:56.911 --> 07:58.521
of our new hot sauces.
Just need you to sign here.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.741
- I have you on
speakerphone in my Volvo.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.264
- Just anything--
an X, a scribble...

08:02.307 --> 08:04.179
- Uh, yeah.
There you go.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.311
- Oh, stock market?
A lot going on there.

08:06.355 --> 08:08.792
- Hang up the phone.
- Oh, hey.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.533
I just need the keys
to the storm shelter.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.709
I like to call Jerry
from somewhere private.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.320
Our conversations
can get a little NSFW.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.410
- Uh...no, you can't--
you can't do that.

08:18.454 --> 08:22.240
First, it's still W
and second, you can't go

08:22.284 --> 08:25.330
to the storm shelter because
there's a surprise there.

08:25.374 --> 08:28.638
- Oh, my God, is it a puppy?
- Uh, yes, it's that.

08:28.682 --> 08:31.119
Uh, Amy got a puppy for
the store and it's sleeping,

08:31.162 --> 08:32.686
so you can't go in there.

08:32.729 --> 08:35.123
- Aw, it'll be so cute!

08:35.166 --> 08:39.257
- I make $109,000 a year.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.564
It is.
It's a thrill.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.740
- So I'm thinking
of moving some of these

08:43.784 --> 08:45.176
uglier frames to the back.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.527
- Wait, those look
like my frames.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.180
Are these ugly?

08:49.224 --> 08:52.357
- No--I just meant
they were, um...

08:52.401 --> 08:55.012
have you ever thought
about something like these?

08:55.056 --> 08:57.188
- I really don't think
about my appearance that much.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.930
I kind of let my
personality speak for itself.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.411
- You should try these on.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.722
- Wow.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.114
Hey...

09:10.158 --> 09:12.203
do something else on me.

09:12.247 --> 09:14.858
- Well, we could
loosen you up a bit.

09:14.902 --> 09:17.948
- All right.
- Okay...

09:17.992 --> 09:19.907
There you go.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.605
- Hey...man.

09:22.649 --> 09:26.130
Hello, Nate Silver.

09:26.174 --> 09:29.046
- It's the best!
I'm not just Dan's assistant,

09:29.090 --> 09:30.874
I'm also his personal stylist.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.746
We spent lunch
shopping for him.

09:32.789 --> 09:35.792
- So you have two jobs,
one paycheck, and no lunch.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.577
- You're missing
the point, okay?

09:37.620 --> 09:40.144
Dan is the only person here
who appreciates the wisdom

09:40.188 --> 09:42.277
I have to offer.
- Oh, really, yeah?

09:42.320 --> 09:44.496
What--what wisdom
is it that I'm missing out on?

09:44.540 --> 09:47.238
- Well, you dress like a kid
from a cereal commercial

09:47.282 --> 09:49.632
and you put way too much
energy into the shoe thing.

09:49.676 --> 09:52.069
But I guess at least you
figured out the beard trick.

09:52.113 --> 09:54.115
- Beard trick?
- I just mean how you use it

09:54.158 --> 09:56.030
to hide your weak chin.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.685
- No, I don't have a weak chin.
I just like having a beard.

09:58.728 --> 10:01.862
- Sorry, Garrett--looks
like our chin secret's out.

10:01.905 --> 10:05.039
- No, we don't
share a chin secret.

10:05.082 --> 10:07.258
- Excuse me.
I'm not the kind of person

10:07.302 --> 10:09.478
who likes to complain
and I am not the kind of person

10:09.521 --> 10:12.220
who's easily offended,
but I have a complaint

10:12.263 --> 10:13.917
about that display.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.571
It's offensive.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.921
- I'm sorry, what display?

10:17.965 --> 10:20.576
- Fire in the hole!

10:20.620 --> 10:23.623
- I can see how it might
not be for everyone.

10:23.666 --> 10:26.669
- Oh, my gosh,
that vendor is always trying

10:26.713 --> 10:28.279
to push that hot sauce on us.

10:28.323 --> 10:30.107
Can't believe Amy fell for it.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.980
- Yeah, she really
dropped the ball.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.852
- Mateo,
you have changed my life.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.549
You're a genius.

10:37.593 --> 10:40.596
- Well, I wouldn't say genius.
Style icon, maybe.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.945
Social influencer?

10:41.989 --> 10:43.773
I mean, yeah,
at the very least.

10:43.817 --> 10:47.559
- Oh, it's my wife.
She's making salmon tonight.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.387
Ah, it's so dry.

10:50.824 --> 10:54.044
- Hang on--you always
know what to do and say.

10:54.088 --> 10:55.916
Maybe you could call her for me

10:55.959 --> 10:57.918
and let her know
I hate her salmon.

10:57.961 --> 11:01.704
- Uh...yeah,
I could--I could do that.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.489
I'm sorry, um...I just--

11:04.533 --> 11:06.709
technically I don't
think it's part of my job.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.190
- Well, technically...

11:09.233 --> 11:11.061
you probably shouldn't
even have the job, you know,

11:11.105 --> 11:13.498
'cause the whole
undocumented thing, so...

11:13.542 --> 11:15.762
we're kind of off
the map here, huh?

11:15.805 --> 11:17.154
We're helping each other out.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.113
Doing each other
a couple of solids.

11:19.156 --> 11:21.289
Two guys, two solids.

11:21.332 --> 11:23.378
And...there we go.

11:26.424 --> 11:30.211
- Hi, this is Mateo.
I--I work with your husband.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.258
Um...what's for dinner?

11:34.302 --> 11:37.479
- That's perfect--
that's perfect.

11:37.522 --> 11:40.047
- So first you say
Glenn is needed in Housewares,

11:40.090 --> 11:41.831
then Softlines,
then the Garden Center.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.311
Shorter intervals each time.

11:43.354 --> 11:44.791
I'm trying to get him
in shape because...

11:44.834 --> 11:46.749
- Got it, messing with Glenn.
I don't care why.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.359
Uh, while I have you here...

11:48.403 --> 11:50.840
you don't think I have
a weak chin, do you?

11:50.884 --> 11:54.104
- No--I assume you have
no chin, hence the beard.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.715
- No, no, no.
I have a chin.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.673
You can come feel it.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.458
- I can't believe Amy would
approve something like this.

12:00.502 --> 12:01.938
- I think she did, though.
I think she signed

12:01.982 --> 12:03.766
for it in her office.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.203
- So we need to take this thing
down and cover butthole

12:06.247 --> 12:08.553
on every single bottle
so we can re-shelve them?

12:08.597 --> 12:10.120
- That's a lot
of buttholes, Jonah.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.166
- I know, Sayid.
It's a ton of buttholes,

12:12.209 --> 12:14.124
but Amy said that the store

12:14.168 --> 12:16.126
is responsible
for the product, now, so...

12:16.170 --> 12:17.737
- Where is Amy, anyway?
- She's busy.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.173
She's very, very busy.

12:19.216 --> 12:22.176
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
Awake and busy.

12:24.395 --> 12:25.527
- Is Amy sleeping?

12:25.570 --> 12:29.400
- No.

12:29.444 --> 12:33.143
- What are you even
saying right now?

12:33.187 --> 12:35.667
That is so random.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.669
- She is--she's sleeping.
- Guys, okay, look.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.367
She's been
working very hard.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.282
- Unlike us?
I haven't stopped working

12:41.325 --> 12:42.849
since my shift started.

12:42.892 --> 12:45.112
- Yeah, that's--that's
kind of the deal.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.462
- You guys, I found
one more butthole.

12:47.505 --> 12:48.550
It's Amy.

12:48.593 --> 12:51.683
This is going so bad.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.777
- Look, guys, I'm sorry.
I--it was supposed

12:57.820 --> 12:59.126
to be a really quick,

12:59.169 --> 13:00.954
15 minute power nap.

13:00.997 --> 13:04.522
But my alarm decided
it knew better than me,

13:04.566 --> 13:07.047
and let me sleep
for four hours.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.614
- It sounds like your alarm
just wanted you to have

13:09.658 --> 13:11.181
a little self care, you know?

13:11.225 --> 13:15.098
- Well, I think self care means
the self is doing the care.

13:15.142 --> 13:18.014
- She's been up late
all week with this inspection

13:18.058 --> 13:19.886
and Parker's been a little
difficult lately, so...

13:19.929 --> 13:21.713
Amy's not the only one

13:21.757 --> 13:23.585
with kids here.
- Marcus, you don't have kids.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.326
- No, but Janet does.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.676
And one of these days,
she's gonna let me watch them.

13:27.719 --> 13:30.157
- No, I'm not.
- What about non-parents?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.855
We need self care, too.
I've been working so hard

13:32.899 --> 13:35.510
I've barely had time
to get frozen custard.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.555
I had to Postmates it.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.209
- Look, guys--
can we just please

13:39.253 --> 13:41.168
move past this
and get back to work?

13:41.211 --> 13:44.824
- Oh, so we have to work while
you lie on a diamond bed

13:44.867 --> 13:47.130
and have unicorns
feed you grapes?

13:47.174 --> 13:49.785
- Yeah, if you can do self care
at work, why can't we?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.874
- Fine--you know what,

13:51.918 --> 13:54.746
if you feel like
you need some self care,

13:54.790 --> 13:57.619
then you should take
a break every now and then.

13:57.662 --> 13:59.577
- Fine, we're doing
it right now.

13:59.621 --> 14:02.667
I'm gonna self care so hard.
Come on.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.800
- Right now is probably
not the best...

14:04.844 --> 14:06.584
'cause we have an inspection...

14:06.628 --> 14:08.978
- I think we'll all feel better
once we cuddle with the puppy.

14:09.022 --> 14:12.939
- Oh, Sandra...
there is no puppy.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.159
- You  us, Amy!

14:18.422 --> 14:20.729
- Wow, this guy's got you
shopping for his wife now?

14:20.772 --> 14:22.470
- Okay, look.
In my situation

14:22.513 --> 14:25.690
you gotta do what you gotta do.
Okay, and sometimes that means

14:25.734 --> 14:28.693
buying shorts for a woman
who gave me no information

14:28.737 --> 14:30.608
about her body type
other than it was quote,

14:30.652 --> 14:32.480
"James Corden in 'Cats.'"

14:32.523 --> 14:35.048
- Buddy, I think
you're working too hard.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.919
Maybe you should start
messing things up and Dan

14:36.963 --> 14:38.616
will stop asking you
to do stuff.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.402
- You don't get it, okay?

14:41.445 --> 14:43.752
Why are you covering your chin?
- I'm not.

14:43.795 --> 14:45.536
I'm just--I'm thinking, dude.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.147
I'm thinking
about your problem.

14:48.278 --> 14:52.239
Quite the conundrum, indeed.

14:59.202 --> 15:01.813
- Attention Cloud Nine
team members,

15:01.857 --> 15:03.598
we need associates
on checkouts

15:03.641 --> 15:05.513
two, three, and four.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.950
If anybody out there feels
like they've made their point,

15:07.994 --> 15:09.430
could you please
get back to work?

15:09.473 --> 15:10.779
Thank you.

15:10.822 --> 15:13.129
- Hey, Amy, this is Wendell,

15:13.173 --> 15:15.392
who you spoke with
over the phone?

15:15.436 --> 15:17.960
Remember, when you were
being super professional

15:18.004 --> 15:20.310
and you agreed to move
the health and safety

15:20.354 --> 15:21.833
inspection to today?

15:23.009 --> 15:26.751
- Yes, hi--how could I forget?

15:26.795 --> 15:28.753
Uh, Wendell,

15:28.797 --> 15:31.800
so nice to put a face
to such a familiar voice.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.845
- Maybe we could
start in the cafÃ©.

15:35.369 --> 15:38.415
- Um...no, no, not the cafÃ©.

15:38.459 --> 15:41.853
Why don't we start somewhere
else, like, um--not jewelry.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.638
The--let's start
in the parking lot.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.683
Yeah, this way.

15:48.121 --> 15:51.167
- I just found
baby carrots in my pockets.

15:51.211 --> 15:52.995
- Weird...
might as well eat 'em.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.737
- Dina, I know what
you're doing and this has

15:55.780 --> 15:58.044
nothing to do with my diabetes.

15:58.087 --> 16:01.917
It's about your unresolved
feelings toward your father.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.398
Which is why
I did a little research

16:04.441 --> 16:09.490
and I tracked down
somebody special.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.708
- Glenn...

16:10.752 --> 16:12.493
- Hang on a second.

16:12.536 --> 16:16.192
He's almost here.

16:16.236 --> 16:19.630
- Oh, no.
- Oh, hey there, Dina.

16:19.674 --> 16:22.329
It's me, your dad.

16:22.372 --> 16:23.983
Mr. Foxx.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.723
- Glenn.
- Glenn Foxx.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.682
- That wasn't his name.
I'm stopping you

16:27.725 --> 16:29.858
because this is dumb.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.078
- Come on, Dina.
Isn't there anything

16:32.121 --> 16:34.906
you wanna say to me?
Your--your dad?

16:36.386 --> 16:39.476
- I guess I've always
wished that you'd been around

16:39.520 --> 16:40.869
to teach me how to ride a bike.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.349
Great.

16:42.392 --> 16:45.178
Well, maybe I can help you
get some closure there.

16:46.266 --> 16:49.704
- Okay, yeah.
That would be nice.

16:49.747 --> 16:52.489
- How is this teaching
you to ride a bike?

16:52.533 --> 16:54.187
- Oh, I'm a visual learner.

16:56.319 --> 17:00.802
- As you can see,
a very healthy, very safe

17:00.845 --> 17:02.847
Housewares section.

17:02.891 --> 17:06.634
So, should we head over
to Sporting Goods?

17:06.677 --> 17:09.115
- Sporting Goods.
- Great.

17:09.158 --> 17:11.639
- So, again, we're on
our way to Sporting Goods.

17:11.682 --> 17:14.903
- Go, go, go, go.
- Sporting Goods.

17:14.946 --> 17:18.820
- Carol is whole.
Carol is beautiful.

17:18.863 --> 17:20.735
Carol is...

17:20.778 --> 17:23.433
- The inspector came early!
You can't have candles in here.

17:23.477 --> 17:26.088
- Okay! Where am I supposed to
put them?

17:26.132 --> 17:27.916
- Who cares? Just get it out of
here.

17:27.959 --> 17:30.875
- Come on, come on.
- I'm going, I'm going.

17:34.923 --> 17:38.579
- Wow, nice work.
- Hmm?

17:38.622 --> 17:41.234
- Uh--nice work, you--

17:41.277 --> 17:44.759
inspecting the hell
out of this store.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.761
- Hot towel?
- You guys need to clean

17:46.804 --> 17:48.458
all of this up.
Amy's on her way with...

17:48.502 --> 17:51.026
- So you wanna see Grocery
instead of Furniture?

17:54.464 --> 17:57.119
Are you sure you don't
wanna see Furniture first?

17:57.163 --> 17:58.990
It really sets
the context for Grocery...

18:00.949 --> 18:03.604
- Fire in the hole.

18:03.647 --> 18:06.998
- Okay, that--that was not
on fire when I approved it.

18:14.789 --> 18:16.704
- I'll start
with the positives.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.358
Most of your store
was not on fire.

18:18.401 --> 18:20.882
Unfortunately,
the part that was on fire

18:20.925 --> 18:23.014
knocked your
score down to a 65.

18:23.058 --> 18:25.191
- Oh, my God.

18:25.234 --> 18:27.018
Look, Wendell, could we maybe

18:27.062 --> 18:28.933
just, please,
schedule a do-over?

18:28.977 --> 18:30.587
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
You passed.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.415
You only needed a 60.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.895
- What?
- We passed?

18:33.938 --> 18:35.723
- Did you see
all the raccoons out...

18:35.766 --> 18:37.855
- Cheyenne,
stop trying to help.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.727
- I use mine all the time.

18:39.770 --> 18:42.556
Soups, stews--
pretty much any wet food.

18:42.599 --> 18:45.254
- Okay, great,
and what is the return policy?

18:45.298 --> 18:47.996
- And this is a linen blend,
so it should have that

18:48.039 --> 18:50.041
"boardroom to boardwalk"
feel she wanted.

18:50.085 --> 18:53.480
- Thank you, Mateo.
Her legs really need the win.

18:53.523 --> 18:56.309
By the way, you know,
you really got in her head

18:56.352 --> 18:57.919
about the salmon thing,

18:57.962 --> 19:00.051
so I was thinking it might
just be easier if you

19:00.095 --> 19:02.315
came over and cooked
dinner for us tonight.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.230
- Oh...

19:04.273 --> 19:06.623
uh...

19:10.323 --> 19:12.238
Whoops!
I'm so clumsy.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.892
God, you probably can't even
trust me with dinner.

19:14.936 --> 19:16.807
I would just drop
it all over the floor.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.114
- Relax, it's fine.
I mean, what am I gonna do?

19:19.158 --> 19:21.899
Ask someone else?
I mean, someone documented

19:21.943 --> 19:24.206
probably wouldn't do any
of this stuff anyway, right?

19:24.250 --> 19:25.816
- I guess not.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.731
- So, anyway--
toward the end of dinner,

19:27.775 --> 19:29.690
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and then you can tell Donna

19:29.733 --> 19:31.344
I'm not ready to have kids.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.084
- What?
I'm supposed to tell

19:33.128 --> 19:34.999
your wife that?
Absolutely not.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.697
- Huh?

19:36.740 --> 19:39.047
- My job is not
to fix your life, okay?

19:39.090 --> 19:41.136
It's to work
in the Vision Center.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.791
And maybe the fun fashion
stuff, but that's it.

19:47.055 --> 19:49.362
- Mateo, you're right.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.973
I've been exploiting you.

19:52.016 --> 19:54.410
I wasn't meaning to, but you--
you're just so cool

19:54.454 --> 19:57.935
and you know so much and I
thought it was just, you know,

19:57.979 --> 20:00.329
a standard exchange of solids.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.940
God, I feel like
a terrible person.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.464
- Well, I wouldn't
say that you're...

20:04.507 --> 20:06.161
- No, I am.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.816
Now let's put our heads
together and figure out

20:08.859 --> 20:10.992
how you're gonna
make me a better one.

20:13.255 --> 20:15.170
- Fine, Dina.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.693
You know what?
Here.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.220
Is that what you wanted?
Hmm?

20:21.263 --> 20:23.222
I'll eat your stupid kale.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.267
- You know what, Glenn?
I don't care.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.356
I'll just go back
to waiting for you to die.

20:27.400 --> 20:30.141
Congratulations, Rose!
Welcome to the Bad Dad club.

20:30.185 --> 20:33.232
- I am not a bad dad.
I am a great dad!

20:36.496 --> 20:38.106
There, you happy?

20:42.719 --> 20:45.200
Is it all gone?

20:45.244 --> 20:48.247
- Your mouth
is entirely full of kale.

20:52.251 --> 20:56.167
- So Dan the Optometrist,
he seems charming?

20:56.211 --> 20:58.213
- He's a giant weirdo,
but the Vision Center's

20:58.257 --> 21:00.868
not too busy and the WiFi
in that corner is super fast.

21:00.911 --> 21:03.305
- Good night, guys.
- Holy...

21:03.349 --> 21:04.915
- Whoa.
- Yeah, I shaved.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.527
- At work?
- Had to do it to 'em.

21:07.570 --> 21:10.225
Some people were
doubting my chin.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.054
- Well...you showed them.

21:13.097 --> 21:16.318
- Hey, man, I can cover
for you till it grows back,

21:16.362 --> 21:17.885
if you want.
- Yeah, I appreciate that.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.103
Should be about
a week and a half.
