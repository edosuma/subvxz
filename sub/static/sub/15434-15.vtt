00:02.200 --> 00:04.700
I slept with mccallister.
So how was he?

00:04.700 --> 00:08.800
What kind of guys do you go for?
Come on, chad, what's his type?

00:08.800 --> 00:11.000
(Sarah) I thought things
were getting better.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.800
(Joe) they are.
Then why did I feel like the other woman

00:13.800 --> 00:15.000
When I walked in here?

00:15.000 --> 00:17.500
There is no one else
that I would rather be with.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.800
Your father was going to buy
the winery.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.600
He died before he could
give you the vineyard.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.400
He wanted you to run it.
Dad had another kid, with holly.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.600
Her name is rebecca.
(Chad) did you sleep with him?

00:29.600 --> 00:33.600
That's all I want to know.
You don't, actually.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.100
I think
the investment is right,

00:35.100 --> 00:36.900
And I think
it's what dad wanted.

00:36.900 --> 00:40.900
I'm voting with holly.

00:41.200 --> 00:45.200
(Rosie thomas' "since you've
been around" playing)

00:45.400 --> 00:48.500
(Heavy breathing)

00:48.500 --> 00:52.200
(Grunts)

00:52.200 --> 00:55.300
Joe? Did you...

00:55.300 --> 00:57.600
It's all right.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.800
(Sighs)

01:00.800 --> 01:02.600
It's fine.

01:02.601 --> 01:04.800
* I'm wandering, I'm crawling *

01:04.800 --> 01:08.100
But, joe, you didn't...
did you?

01:08.100 --> 01:09.600
It's fine, sarah.

01:09.600 --> 01:13.600
* just can't seem
to get around *

01:13.900 --> 01:17.400
* and I'm heavy, I'm weary *

01:17.400 --> 01:19.500
* I'm not thinking clearly *

01:19.500 --> 01:22.400
(Sarah) something's
been happening in bed.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.200
Lately, I haven't been able
to let go.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.200
I just get a wave of...

01:29.500 --> 01:32.000
Yeah, so I'm about to...

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Uh, let go,
and something blocks it.

01:37.300 --> 01:41.300
(Man) blocks it?

01:41.300 --> 01:44.000
Do you think maybe you're
thinking about someone else?

01:44.000 --> 01:47.600
Like... you don'yoreally
wanna be there with me?

01:47.600 --> 01:48.600
Th's not true.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.400
I get tired, thinking of
the kids and teaching and--

01:51.400 --> 01:52.700
Oh, come on, joe.
When we're making love,

01:52.700 --> 01:56.700
I don't think you're thinking about teaching.
Just say it then.

02:00.100 --> 02:03.500
It's jessica's mom, vanessa.

02:03.500 --> 02:04.700
You can't let go with me

02:04.700 --> 02:08.199
Because you're thinking
about her, and you feel guilty.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.300
Vanessa?
The mother of one of paige's friends.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.800
Sarah's convinced I have a thing
for her, which is not true.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.300
I just think that this whole
withholding thing began

02:15.300 --> 02:17.000
When you became friends
with her.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.500
You know, teaching her
how to play "proud mary"

02:19.500 --> 02:21.800
Or whatever it was.
Our kids have playdates.

02:21.800 --> 02:25.800
Yeah, our kids, joe, not us.
We don't get to play.

02:26.300 --> 02:30.300
We have to stop now.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.200
Would you like to have
another session this week?

02:34.200 --> 02:38.200
I think it would be
productive. Hmm?

02:41.400 --> 02:42.700
Hmm, how about thursday
at 4:00?

02:42.700 --> 02:45.700
Um, just...
that's good.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.000
4:00? 4:30?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.700
4:00.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.700
Okay, 00 it is.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.700
So, senator,
the "san jose mercury news"

02:52.700 --> 02:54.500
Wants an interview
about the strategic alliances

02:54.500 --> 02:57.200
Between silicon valley
and the asian markets, senator.

02:57.200 --> 03:01.000
Who's it with?
Uh, who's it with? It's with bruce newman, senator.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.300
He hates me.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.300
In his last editorial,

03:03.300 --> 03:04.800
He said I wasn't as smart
as hillary clinton,

03:04.800 --> 03:08.400
But I was prettier.
Oh. Uh, well, do you want me to cancel it, senator?

03:08.400 --> 03:09.600
Schedule it over the phone.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.100
Maybe he'll
hear my ideas better

03:11.100 --> 03:14.800
If he's not getting lost
in my blue eyes.
(Chuckles)

03:14.800 --> 03:16.400
And by the way,

03:16.400 --> 03:19.100
Stop calling me "senator"
every five seconds.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.700
It's oddly disconcerting.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.900
Well, it seems that
the whole world knows about us.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.000
"People" magazine
ran a photograph.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.700
"Page six" has a paragraph
about us "canoodling."

03:27.700 --> 03:29.000
And I'm expecting
a phone call from

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
The "congressional quarterly"
at any moment.

03:31.000 --> 03:31.700
So therefore,

03:31.700 --> 03:34.000
I now have to reestablish
my professional standing

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
With every single solitary
person in this office, senator.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.200
Kitty, look around.
Nobody cares.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.700
Really? Then why is everybody
looking at me like

03:40.700 --> 03:43.500
I'm the biggest slattern of the pacific rim?
"Slattern"?

03:43.500 --> 03:45.300
While you come off like
some conquering, postmodern,

03:45.300 --> 03:47.500
Latter day kennedy--Not that
I'm angry out that.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.300
Kitty,
this is the field office

03:49.300 --> 03:50.600
Of the junior senator
from california,

03:50.600 --> 03:52.800
Not the lunchroom
at malibu high.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.100
They're all serious-Minded
public servants

03:56.100 --> 03:57.100
Working to end poverty,

03:57.100 --> 03:59.200
Make education
and health care better.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.100
They're legislating,
governing...

04:02.100 --> 04:03.700
We're making
a better america.

04:03.700 --> 04:06.400
Oh, my god, you sound like
a bumper sticker.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.200
A good one? 'Cause that's one of
the slogans we're working on

04:08.200 --> 04:09.500
For the campai.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.200
"We're making a better america." What do you think?
I think it's subronic.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.000
Well, noreen ran a field poll
on it, and america agreed.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.300
It scored in the 80s.
Well,
america is sometimes wrong.

04:19.300 --> 04:23.100
I think the democrats
are already using that one.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.000
Well, i, uh,
i better leave.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.500
Because if I stay in here
any longer,

04:26.500 --> 04:30.000
Everybody's going to assume that
we are going at it like weasels.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.600
Kitty.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.600
No one in this offe is
thinking about sex, just you.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.600
Right.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.700
Wow.

04:41.700 --> 04:45.600
Cute outfit, by the way.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.900
(Sighs)

04:47.900 --> 04:48.900
With no other business,

04:48.900 --> 04:51.400
Thank god this meeting
is adjourned.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.000
I'm sorry, holly. I hope
there are no hard feelings.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.700
(Sighs) hey, I lost this one.
You won.

04:57.700 --> 04:58.700
It's only business, right?

04:58.700 --> 05:01.200
Well, the board agreed it wasn't
the best time to buy a vineyard.

05:01.200 --> 05:05.100
Sorry you two were outvoted.
Tommy, thanks for voting with your gut.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.500
Yeah.
This never should have come to a vote.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.800
We should've
settled this quietly.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.300
The board doesn't need to see
us divided. That's a first.

05:10.300 --> 05:13.100
Oh, two of us voted with the family, saul.
I didn't vote

05:13.100 --> 05:17.100
As some cool rebellion against
you. I studied the numbers.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.600
I wanted to buy it  because it's a good deal.
In your opinion,

05:19.600 --> 05:23.200
Which was not shared by the board.
All right, kids, come on.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.400
Put this one to bed, okay?

05:25.400 --> 05:27.600
(Under breh)
peace in our time.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.400
I studied
the numbers, too, tommy.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.700
You seem to forget that
i actually know what I'm doing.

05:31.700 --> 05:35.700
That's why I'm here.
Remember?

05:36.500 --> 05:38.500
When you're blesd
with a daughter

05:38.500 --> 05:40.000
Who graduated with honors

05:40.000 --> 05:42.800
From the wharton school of business...
(whispers) dad.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.500
Uh, you hope for the day
when you might convince her

05:46.500 --> 05:50.500
To share the benefit
of a rather expensive education.

05:50.500 --> 05:54.600
So after begging her
and cajoling her,

05:54.600 --> 05:55.400
I finally convinced

05:55.400 --> 05:58.100
This wonderful, beautiful
brilliant woman

05:58.100 --> 05:59.600
To take a leave of absence

05:59.600 --> 06:03.100
From her fancy corporate job
at north light coffee,

06:03.100 --> 06:07.100
And temporarily
comend help her old man out.

06:08.400 --> 06:12.400
It's my pleasure, daddy.

06:14.900 --> 06:17.900
(Nora) maybe my paintings
are in the other box upstairs.

06:17.900 --> 06:21.200
Well, I'm not dragging any more
boxes out of the attic, mom.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.500
I just want an opinion

06:22.500 --> 06:25.700
Before I think about
classes or art school.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.000
Why is my opinion

06:27.000 --> 06:28.800
Of your artistic talent
relevant?

06:28.800 --> 06:30.600
Because, kevin,
you have a certain something

06:30.600 --> 06:34.600
That your other siblings lack--  An aesthetic.
You mean 'cause I'm gay.

06:35.300 --> 06:36.800
Oh.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.300
Oh. Here...

06:39.300 --> 06:41.600
Oh. Okay, now st tell me
what you think.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.800
God, I remember
when I did this.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.100
I was about 20,
taking art classes.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.600
I hadn't even
met your dad yet.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.700
I just thought I could
do anything, just be an artist.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.700
It's bad. All right,
i knew it. I just...

06:56.700 --> 07:00.700
(Sighs) I just feel like
i have so much to say.

07:01.700 --> 07:02.700
(Cell phone rings)

07:02.700 --> 07:04.700
Ooh, look at this.

07:04.700 --> 07:07.200
What is it, chad?
Kevin, listen...

07:07.200 --> 07:08.800
I need to talk to you.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.300
(Sighs) I don't think so.
Just meet me. Please?

07:12.300 --> 07:15.300
I broke up with michelle.
Come on, just meet me, please.

07:15.300 --> 07:18.400
North light coffee,
figueroa and 6th. Half an hour.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.600
Listen to this--
I can't. I have to go, mom.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.300
No, listen to this.

07:21.300 --> 07:24.300
It was a short story I was
writing and then abandoned

07:24.300 --> 07:26.100
Right before
your father and I got married.

07:26.100 --> 07:30.100
Short stories? Painting?
Who knew you were so creative?
Just listen.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.600
"She drove up
the coast road, crying.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.900
"Deep down, she knew that love
was a lie she had sold herself

07:35.900 --> 07:37.700
"So she wouldn't
grow old alone,

07:37.700 --> 07:40.900
A lie that would
cost her everything."

07:40.900 --> 07:44.700
Wow, mom. That's...
that's heavy.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.700
I never finished it.
I guess I got too scared.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.500
See you later.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.300
Bye.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.500
(Chad) something's
happening to me.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.000
I just
keep thinking about you.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.300
Look, that--That may be,

07:56.300 --> 07:59.400
But I can't do this whole
push and pull routine.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.100
You know,
it's so retrograde.

08:01.100 --> 08:03.600
And I'm sorry, I'm not slinking
back into some closet for you.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.300
Politilly, it's--
Forget closets. Forget politics.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.400
I was really happy
waking up next to you.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.700
I don't know what it is.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.700
You're an actor.
You're acting.

08:16.700 --> 08:17.900
You're going after
your "goal"

08:17.900 --> 08:18.900
Or whatever the hell
they call it.

08:18.900 --> 08:22.900
They teach you this crap
in acting school.

08:23.900 --> 08:27.800
I didn't go to school,
and I'm not that good an actor.

08:28.500 --> 08:32.500
Just one date.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Hey, noreen, can I get a copy
of the new polling data?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.600
Which poll
are you talking about?

08:41.600 --> 08:43.799
Well, the ones where
you tested the new slogans.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.600
Oh, that one. Yeah.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.100
Why? Is there another one?

08:48.100 --> 08:50.400
Oh, there's always another poll.
It's endless.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.200
I have numbers
on the senator's tie color

08:52.200 --> 08:55.400
If you want to see those.
Actually, I wanna see all the data that you get.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.900
Can you c.C. Me
on everything?

08:57.900 --> 09:01.900
These polling numbers
are giving me heartburn.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.200
Oh, kitty. Hi.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.700
Hi, gary. (Chuckles)

09:07.700 --> 09:09.200
What are those numbers?

09:09.200 --> 09:13.200
It's...

09:13.200 --> 09:17.300
Can I see?

09:17.300 --> 09:21.300
Thank you.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.600
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.600
You did--You did--
You did a poll on me?

09:33.900 --> 09:36.600
Not bad. We got some decent
press coverage.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.200
Not to mention, kitty,
that was fantastic.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.000
You and the kids
and the cooking and everything.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.200
Very warm. Very warm.
I love that.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.400
Okay, I'll get the car.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.700
So that's what this
was all about?

09:48.700 --> 09:50.800
Making me look cuddly
for public consumption?

09:50.800 --> 09:53.300
You're not talking about that stupid poll, are you?
So you did know about it.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.200
Well, senator,

09:54.200 --> 09:56.000
You better tell me right now
that you didn't order it,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.800
Or you will have the world's
first assassinion by spatula.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.800
Look, of course
i didn't order it.

10:00.800 --> 10:04.800
It was a misguided attempt
by a well-Meaning staffer

10:05.000 --> 10:07.300
Who wanted to assess
the public's perception

10:07.300 --> 10:09.900
Of my personal strengths and liabilities.
Oh, except it wasn't about

10:09.900 --> 10:11.300
Your personal strengths
and liabilities.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.200
It was about mine,
and whether or not

10:13.200 --> 10:16.900
America is going to approve of us as a couple.
It was a mistake.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.700
It's been taken care of.
Let's move on.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.100
Well, no, no, no, please,
just tell me who requested it.

10:21.100 --> 10:24.000
It was noreen, wasn't it?
Oh, what does it matter who--

10:24.000 --> 10:25.200
Yes, it was noreen.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.900
Okay, but the numbers are
completely off. I promise you.

10:27.900 --> 10:31.200
Oh. Why? What were they?

10:31.200 --> 10:33.500
You didn't read the poll?
No.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.000
I accidentally crumpled it up
into a tiny, little ball.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.800
Good.
Let's keep it that way.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.000
You coming?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.500
Uh, uh, no.
No, I'm--I'm gonna, um...

10:43.500 --> 10:44.800
You go ahead.
I'll see you there.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.800
I'm gonna ride with gary.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.800
Uh, so, gary, you--You think
i could bring my numbers up

10:53.800 --> 10:55.100
With a few more
of these events?

10:55.100 --> 10:58.400
Well, we're never gonna get you
into positive range,

10:58.400 --> 11:00.700
But maybe we can bump you up
out of the low 30s.

11:00.700 --> 11:01.600
The lows 30s? Wow.

11:01.600 --> 11:05.400
Wow, i-I was in
the low 30s?

11:05.400 --> 11:08.400
Low to mid.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.200
"Low to mid"?

11:11.200 --> 11:12.400
(Knock on door)
tommy?

11:12.400 --> 11:15.700
Hey, saul, listen,
i-I need to ask you something.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.500
Anything. What is it?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.800
You have a relationship
with holly

11:20.800 --> 11:22.500
That nobody else does...

11:22.500 --> 11:23.800
Obviously.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.100
Find something out for me.

11:26.100 --> 11:28.000
Look, I need to know
if she was telling the truth

11:28.000 --> 11:29.800
About dad buying the winery
for me to run,

11:29.800 --> 11:32.400
Or if she just made
the whole thing up

11:32.400 --> 11:35.300
To, you know, get my vote.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.600
Look, she would never
do anything like that.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.600
But I want you
to listen to me.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.600
You have to move on.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.900
No. If my dad died before
he had a chance to tell me

11:43.900 --> 11:47.900
He believed in me,
in my abilities...

11:48.400 --> 11:50.000
I need--I need to know that.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.700
Why would you even
doubt that?

11:53.700 --> 11:56.500
Don't you know?

11:56.500 --> 11:58.000
You are him.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.100
Am i?
Yes.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.600
So why did he take
the company from me, saul?

12:02.600 --> 12:05.800
The union's not gonna stand for
these huge deductibles.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.500
In case of
catastrophic illness,

12:07.500 --> 12:09.300
We'll pay
the employee deductible

12:09.300 --> 12:11.900
And still save 20%.

12:11.900 --> 12:15.900
(Chuckles)
look at you two.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.400
I can't tell you
how much this warms my heart,

12:18.400 --> 12:20.900
To see the two of you guys
working togeth.

12:20.900 --> 12:23.400
And how proud I am to have
two members of my family

12:23.400 --> 12:27.200
Who wanna be a part
of what i've built here.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.900
I'm very grateful.

12:28.900 --> 12:30.700
(Sarah) thanks, daddy.

12:30.700 --> 12:34.200
Tommy, you listen to your sister
now. She knows her stuff.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.800
I know, dad.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.700
Now I think I may have

12:37.700 --> 12:41.000
Talked her into making it
permanent.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.500
Okay, you guys
get back to work.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.500
I'm gonna go home,
hug your mother,

12:45.500 --> 12:48.300
Tell her what a great job
she did with you two.

12:48.300 --> 12:52.300
Good night.
Night, dad.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.100
Look, tommy--

12:54.100 --> 12:56.100
It's okay.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.600
I knew this was coming.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.300
I just wish
you would've told me up front

12:59.300 --> 13:01.400
This is what you wanted.
Nothing's been decided.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.700
It's, um, you know,
it wasn't planned.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.400
It's just kind of...
fallen into place.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.500
Look, i've spent 12 years
learning this business.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.700
In a matter of weeks,

13:12.700 --> 13:15.400
You've turned me
into a-A junior partner.
Oh, come on.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.500
It didn't happen by accident.
It didn't just fall into place.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.700
Look, tommy, all i've done
is come here and work hard.

13:21.700 --> 13:25.000
If there was a plan,
it was dad's, not mine.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Maybe he's the one
you should be mad at.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.900
(Vanessa) it was one of those
friendly divorces.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.400
You know, everyone was betr off.
How do you manage work

13:34.400 --> 13:37.100
And bringing a kid up
by yourself?

13:37.100 --> 13:40.600
(Laughs) I have
a good mom, a nanny,

13:40.600 --> 13:42.400
And I can do graphic design
from home, thank god.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.600
(Door closes)
well, that's good.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.200
Hey. Oh.
Hi.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.100
Hi, vanessa.
Hey.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.100
Hi, hon. Tea?

13:49.100 --> 13:52.400
Tea? Uh, no.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.200
Uh, sarah invited me
for a grown-Up playdate.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.700
Cool. That's great.

13:56.700 --> 13:59.700
The girls are upstairs drawing,
if you wanna say hi.

13:59.700 --> 14:03.700
Yeah.
I'll go check on the girls.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.500
You know what it felt like?

14:07.500 --> 14:08.700
It felt like
i was being sidelined,

14:08.700 --> 14:12.000
Like you were co-Opting my frid and spying on me.
No, I just--

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
I wanted to get to know her,
to--To see what you--

14:15.000 --> 14:19.100
This woman,
i have no interest in her.
Sarah?

14:20.300 --> 14:23.400
With all you've learned recently
about your father

14:23.400 --> 14:26.100
And his infidelities...

14:26.100 --> 14:27.600
That could have
some bearing here, no?

14:27.600 --> 14:30.600
I don't know. Maybe.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.100
I won't pay
for william's crimes.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.500
And I won't pay for the fact
that I am trying

14:34.500 --> 14:36.700
To have a career
and be a wife and mom.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.500
God, I dream of ing at home
to watch those kids grow up!

14:39.500 --> 14:43.500
Sarah, I don't blame you
for working.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.700
I choose to be
a stay-At-Home dad.

14:46.700 --> 14:50.000
(Scoffs) you have no idea
how small the day can be.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.800
I mean, it's...
peanut butter sandwiches

14:52.800 --> 14:55.800
And scrapes
and picking them up,

14:55.800 --> 14:57.300
And... that's fine.

14:57.300 --> 14:58.900
But don't begrudge me

14:58.900 --> 15:00.300
Being hungry for a little bit
of adult company

15:00.300 --> 15:01.100
In the midst of all that.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.900
Oh, I'm not
enough company for you?

15:03.900 --> 15:06.600
You're--You're looking
for something.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.100
I'm not enough for you.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.700
Am I enough for you?

15:10.700 --> 15:14.700
Honestly, am I enough?

15:18.700 --> 15:21.800
God! This is just hell,
coming here.

15:21.800 --> 15:25.000
It's just...

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
Hell.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.500
(Nora) oh, sarah,
you don't really think

15:31.500 --> 15:33.500
Anything happened between
joe and vanessa?

15:33.500 --> 15:36.800
No, but it's brought up
some things from my past

15:36.800 --> 15:37.800
I haven't come to terms with.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.800
Sarah,
tell me what's happening.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.400
Ugh. Okay.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.700
One of the reasons that
i left north light so abruptly

15:47.700 --> 15:51.700
Was that
there was this man there...

15:52.100 --> 15:53.400
Noah.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.400
Nothing happened, but...

15:56.400 --> 15:58.400
It could have.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.900
There was a connection.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.700
He, you know, had passions,

16:03.700 --> 16:07.200
Had made himself
in the world.

16:07.200 --> 16:11.100
I found myself
looking forward to seeing him.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.300
I started to dress for it

16:13.300 --> 16:14.300
And make myself...
beautiful.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.800
Yeah.
Yeah.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.000
Oh, god, we came so close.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.300
It was--Whoa,
it was like vertigo.

16:21.300 --> 16:23.000
And joe, does joe know?

16:23.000 --> 16:26.100
No. No, i've never told him.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.600
Now you're playing
"what if..."

16:27.600 --> 16:29.100
What if you'd
gone through with it?

16:29.100 --> 16:30.400
Have--Have you
seen noah again?

16:30.400 --> 16:34.400
No. No, i-I-I don't think
it's about noah.

16:34.900 --> 16:38.700
No, I don't think so either.
It is about you d joe.

16:38.700 --> 16:42.700
There's this terrible,
bruised silence between us.

16:44.200 --> 16:47.700
Therapy's not helping.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.200
I don't know what to do.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.500
Tell him.

16:51.500 --> 16:55.200
Sarah, tell joe everything.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.500
En I think about
your father, and...

16:58.500 --> 17:00.900
How much torture
he must have gone through,

17:00.900 --> 17:03.500
Holding all those secrets
so close for so long--

17:03.500 --> 17:06.800
Sarah,
just tell joe everything.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.300
What would you have done,

17:08.300 --> 17:12.200
If he'd told you?

17:12.599 --> 17:15.700
Well...

17:15.700 --> 17:19.700
I'll never have the chance
to find out, will i?

17:21.400 --> 17:25.400
Oh, my god.
Tommy, lk at our baby.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.900
I can't believe
i saw our baby's face.

17:27.900 --> 17:29.000
Can you do that again?

17:29.000 --> 17:32.300
I'll try.
He's being a little shy.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.000
He?
Or she.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.500
Because I definitely think I saw
a penis go by a minute ago.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.200
Look, right--Right there.
What's that?

17:39.200 --> 17:42.000
That's a thumb.
A big thumb.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.400
(Laughs) in case you can't tell,
doctor, my husband wants a boy.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.900
That is not true.

17:45.900 --> 17:49.100
I would love a little girl.
Mmm.

17:49.100 --> 17:52.900
Feet! Oh, look at those
adorable little toes.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.700
Look! See? Right there,
that's definitely a penis!

17:54.700 --> 17:56.900
No, that would be a foot.

17:56.900 --> 18:00.200
Doc, I'm about eight years shy
of my medical degree,

18:00.200 --> 18:03.700
T I'm pretty sure
that makes three feet.

18:03.700 --> 18:07.500
Yep, and that right there...

18:07.500 --> 18:09.300
Is the fourth one.

18:09.300 --> 18:11.900
(Laughs)

18:11.900 --> 18:14.000
Oh, my god!

18:14.000 --> 18:14.700
Twins?

18:14.700 --> 18:16.300
Congratulations.

18:16.300 --> 18:18.200
(Laughs)
you okay with at?

18:18.200 --> 18:22.300
Yes! Oh, my god,
i get to be a dad twice.

18:22.500 --> 18:26.300
What could be better than that?
Hey, do it again. I wanna...

18:26.300 --> 18:28.600
(Knock on door)

18:28.600 --> 18:29.800
Hi.

18:29.800 --> 18:30.900
You left the dinner

18:30.900 --> 18:32.300
For concerned women of america
so quickly,

18:32.300 --> 18:34.800
You didn't get dessert,
so I brought you some.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.100
Well, they were looking a little
less concerned there at the end,

18:38.100 --> 18:39.600
So I snuck out.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.900
I pe I'm not coming by
too late.

18:40.900 --> 18:43.100
No, no.
Justin and nora are out.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.900
Good.

18:44.900 --> 18:48.900
Mmm.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.300
I have got to do that
more often.

18:51.300 --> 18:53.800
Oh, well, you may wanna
check with your handlers first.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.700
You're not still upset  about that poll.
Well, of course I'm still upset

18:57.700 --> 19:01.000
I mean, what I don't understand is how come you're not.
Because I don't care

19:01.000 --> 19:03.500
Well,
that's not what I mean.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.000
I--I'm talking about
why isn't--The pson

19:06.000 --> 19:08.800
Who--Who did this
still has a job.
I-I told you

19:08.800 --> 19:10.800
Well--Well, I guess
i don't do what I'm told,

19:10.800 --> 19:12.100
Because look--
Look right here...

19:12.100 --> 19:14.800
I'm "overbearing"
and I'm "opinionated."

19:14.800 --> 19:17.100
Oh, and another thing--
"Aloof."

19:17.100 --> 19:18.900
Now that's a big one.
Apparently, I'm very aloof.
Kitty...

19:18.900 --> 19:20.700
No, no, no,
maybe you're just reacting

19:20.700 --> 19:23.700
To my general
"lack of warmth." Mm-Hmm.

19:23.700 --> 19:26.100
Or maybe it's just my general
appearance is wrong. I'm--

19:26.100 --> 19:28.600
Stop it.
No, my hair is too blonde or my clothes are too expensive.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.900
Or maybe I'm just too damn thin.
Are you done?

19:30.900 --> 19:32.700
No. I wanna know why
noreen the polling witch

19:32.700 --> 19:35.900
Still has a job.
This has nothing to do with  noreen, and you know it.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.300
You know what? I give that
a 5--Strongly disagree.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.000
All right, kitty, listen,
when this fever

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
Of thin-Skinned behavior's passed, we'll talk.
Oh.

19:45.300 --> 19:48.500
Mom, whaare you doing?
Nothing. Nothing. I just gotere

19:48.500 --> 19:51.300
And found justin here lurking at the front door.
I wasn't lurking.

19:51.300 --> 19:53.500
Then why didn't you go in?
Because kitty was
yelling at the senator, mom.

19:53.500 --> 19:56.700
Justin, it really isn't any of our business.
You know, I think this is

19:56.700 --> 19:58.600
No, no. No, really,
you guys go ahead.

19:58.600 --> 20:02.600
We'll just get out of your way.
Oh, look a swan.
Mom.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.100
Nora, kitty, good night.
Justin.

20:05.100 --> 20:09.100
Good night.
We'll talk tomorrow.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.200
(Sighs)
you were yelling at him?

20:10.200 --> 20:13.400
Mmm. Mm-Hmm, and you were right.
It's none of your business.
Yes, yes, of course.

20:13.400 --> 20:17.400
I just hope it was about
funding for the arts. (Laughs)

20:17.900 --> 20:18.800
(Nora) justin, come on!

20:18.800 --> 20:21.000
Come here. Come here.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.700
Do you, um...

20:22.700 --> 20:26.500
Do--Do you think
that I'm aloof?

20:26.500 --> 20:28.800
Yeah.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.600
Are you gonna eat this?

20:31.600 --> 20:33.300
Everybody gives me
the same damn advice

20:33.300 --> 20:35.600
When I say I miss you.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.700
They say, "talk to him..."

20:37.700 --> 20:40.600
Like you'll answer.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.600
I mean, lately, i'd just like
to ask you what the...

20:43.600 --> 20:47.400
What the hell is going on.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.400
You left
so many plans unfinished.

20:52.700 --> 20:56.700
Unfinished.

20:56.700 --> 21:00.700
(Sniffles)

21:03.200 --> 21:07.200
I'm having kids... two...

21:09.100 --> 21:12.300
A boy and a girl.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.400
This is not the way
i imagined

21:14.400 --> 21:18.400
Breaking that bit of news
to you.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.600
Truth is, i...

21:21.600 --> 21:22.900
I hope I'm smart enough

21:22.900 --> 21:26.900
To give 'em the good bits
you gave me and...

21:28.400 --> 21:31.600
I hope to god I can
spare them your other side.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.200
(William)
so what is this, tommy?

21:33.200 --> 21:34.400
You come all the way
out here

21:34.400 --> 21:35.900
Just to spout off
and leave?

21:35.900 --> 21:38.500
There's nothing
left to say, dad.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.800
You tell me to be patient,
to trust you,

21:41.800 --> 21:44.000
And then you--You hand sarah
the business.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I mean,
how--How blind are you?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.200
Do you think that left me
feeling okay?!

21:48.200 --> 21:51.800
I had no idea you were so jealous about your sister.
Oh, you didn't?

21:51.800 --> 21:54.400
I'm human, okay?

21:54.400 --> 21:56.600
I mean, I thought
i was doing a good job for you.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.800
I-I thought you trusted me.
What did I do wrong, dad?

21:59.800 --> 22:01.600
You didn't do--You didn't...
please tell me,
what did I do wrong?

22:01.600 --> 22:04.100
You didn't do anything wrong.

22:04.100 --> 22:06.200
Tommy, i've always
had plans for you.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.700
(Scoffs) that's your mantra,
isn't it?

22:08.700 --> 22:10.200
Well, what are they?
Tell me.

22:10.200 --> 22:13.700
Nothing solid yet.
You've just gotta  patient.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.900
When the time comes, I'm--

22:15.900 --> 22:18.200
(Holly)
william? Where'd you go?

22:18.200 --> 22:22.200
I'm opening another bottle!

22:30.800 --> 22:34.800
What are you gonna do,
tommy?

22:36.500 --> 22:39.800
Nothing, dad. I'm...

22:39.800 --> 22:43.700
I'm just gonna
go back to work, okay?

22:47.400 --> 22:50.300
(Door opens and closes)

22:50.300 --> 22:51.100
Well, this is fun.

22:51.100 --> 22:53.900
Home on a saturday night,
just like the good old days.

22:53.900 --> 22:56.500
You were never home on a saturday night.
I was, too, when I was grounded

22:56.500 --> 22:59.700
So actually, we were home
a lot of saturday nights.

22:59.700 --> 23:03.500
Mmm! God, this is good.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.200
I think that's why
tyler likes me again.

23:05.200 --> 23:05.900
Because I made her one,

23:05.900 --> 23:08.000
And now she's like
my little prisoner of love.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.800
I can't believe you got tyler
back. I mean, it's unbelievable.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.000
You spend your whole life

23:12.000 --> 23:15.900
Being forgiven
and making girls forget.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.800
Don't worry.
It's nonalcoholic.

23:18.800 --> 23:19.800
And that's the point, right?

23:19.800 --> 23:21.800
I mean, you--
You sort of take new paths.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.600
It's, like, the adult thing
to do, I guess.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.900
Oh, god.
They did this poll...

23:26.900 --> 23:28.600
You know,
as if I were an issue--

23:28.600 --> 23:31.100
Which I guess
i probably am--

23:31.100 --> 23:34.000
Like global warming
or, you know, his tan.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.100
But it was--
It was really--

23:35.100 --> 23:37.700
So demeaning
and so unsubstantial.

23:37.700 --> 23:40.100
And do you know that they
actually said I was overbearing?

23:40.100 --> 23:42.800
Will you stop bitching?

23:42.800 --> 23:44.000
Okay, I mean,
it was your dumb-Ass choice

23:44.000 --> 23:45.700
To go into politics
in the first place.

23:45.700 --> 23:47.400
And you spent what, years
writing about other people?

23:47.400 --> 23:49.700
But now you're in it.

23:49.700 --> 23:52.000
It's not like watching anymore.
It's like war.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
Hmm. And what exactly
is your point?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
All right, the senator
is a soldier, right?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.500
A good one,
maybe even a great one,

23:59.500 --> 24:00.800
And he and everyone
who works for him

24:00.800 --> 24:02.600
St want the best intel
for the mission.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.800
And you know what?
You're a factor.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.800
Like, a big factor.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.200
I liked you so much better
when you were stupid.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.100
You're stupid.

24:11.100 --> 24:12.100
You're stupid.
You're stupider.

24:12.100 --> 24:15.000
You're the stupidest.
Aw. Look at you two.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.700
It reminds me
of when you were kids.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.900
Um, would you
listen to something

24:18.900 --> 24:19.900
From my writing class?

24:19.900 --> 24:23.300
Now I really just want  a very honest reaction, okay?
Uh, well,

24:23.300 --> 24:26.800
Because justin is in
one of his truth-Telling moods.
I hate you.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.200
All right, here we go.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.100
"As she drove up the coast road,
she considered her options.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.800
"There was always drugs
or running away

24:33.800 --> 24:35.300
"Or taking on a new identity

24:35.300 --> 24:37.000
"In one of those towns
up the coast

24:37.000 --> 24:38.500
"Where nobody would know her,

24:38.500 --> 24:41.100
"Except it would have to be
very far up the coast,

24:41.100 --> 24:43.500
Because dora was
so well-Known on that coast--"

24:43.500 --> 24:45.000
Dora?
Dora?

24:45.000 --> 24:47.300
It's fiction.

24:47.300 --> 24:48.600
Look at the two ofou.

24:48.600 --> 24:51.900
All right, all right. Here we go.
(Whispers) stop it. Stop.

24:51.900 --> 24:54.100
"Dora sped into the night,
dreaming of freedom...

24:54.100 --> 24:57.100
An impossible freedom
and a new life."

24:57.100 --> 24:58.500
A new life?

24:58.500 --> 25:01.000
(Justin) it's good, mom.
It's really--Dora--
(Kitty) yeah.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.200
Thanks. Thanks,
thanks, thanks.

25:04.200 --> 25:07.000
(Kevin) this is for you.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
(Chad) thanks.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.500
Whoa.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.000
"Letters to a young poet."

25:14.000 --> 25:16.600
Yeah, my mom has suddenly
taken up writing,

25:16.600 --> 25:19.000
So I got her a copy,

25:19.000 --> 25:20.500
And I thought
you might like one, too.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.100
Uh, have you read it?

25:22.100 --> 25:25.500
It's only
my "due north," kevin.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.800
"Love is difficult.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.000
"For one human being
to love another human being--

25:29.000 --> 25:33.100
"That is the most difficult task
that has been entrusted to us,

25:33.400 --> 25:36.200
"The final test and proof,

25:36.200 --> 25:38.200
"The work for which
all other work

25:38.200 --> 25:42.200
Is merely preparation."

25:42.900 --> 25:45.100
Wow. And, um...

25:45.100 --> 25:46.200
Do you believe that?

25:46.200 --> 25:48.800
That love is difficult?

25:48.800 --> 25:52.800
I've never been good at it.
I mean, look at me and you.

25:53.700 --> 25:57.000
Is it easy for you?

25:57.000 --> 26:00.200
Um, I would say
i-I basically screw it up.

26:00.200 --> 26:03.600
Yeah, or become
wildly interested

26:03.600 --> 26:07.300
In the chronically,
hugely, available.

26:07.300 --> 26:11.200
Like you, for instance

26:11.300 --> 26:15.300
Kevin, you really have no idea
how available I am.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.900
You know,
whatever journey i've been on,

26:23.900 --> 26:27.400
I think at age 34, i've...

26:27.400 --> 26:31.300
Finally, maybe found out
who I wanna be,

26:31.800 --> 26:35.800
And where I wanna go.

26:36.700 --> 26:40.700
And who I wanna
go there with.

This is the greatest friggin'
restaurant on earth, isn't it?

27:10.800 --> 27:11.800
Hello?

27:11.800 --> 27:13.000
Kevin?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.700
It's michelle.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.800
Chad's michelle.
Look, you shld know this--

27:17.800 --> 27:21.000
Oh, god.
Um, what--What... (sighs)

27:21.000 --> 27:22.500
Why--Why are you doing this?

27:22.500 --> 27:25.000
'Cause I like you,
that's why.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.800
He's done this before.
It's his thing.

27:28.800 --> 27:32.400
He's gonna get real close to you
and then he's gonna be tortured.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.300
And he's gonna
find some girl...

27:35.300 --> 27:36.900
Like me,

27:36.900 --> 27:40.900
And you're never going
to speak to him again... ever.

27:41.100 --> 27:43.500
(Sighs)
he hurt you, didn't he?

27:43.500 --> 27:44.800
No.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.400
I'll be fine.

27:46.400 --> 27:50.400
It's you I'm worried about.

27:51.100 --> 27:52.100
E?

27:52.100 --> 27:53.400
U've been very quiet.

27:53.400 --> 27:57.400
Your wife has said she almost
had an affair with another man.

27:59.500 --> 28:02.800
Am I supposed
to be relieved she didn't?

28:02.800 --> 28:05.100
Or grateful or frightened?

28:05.100 --> 28:07.200
I just...

28:07.200 --> 28:09.600
When I saw you with vanessa,

28:09.600 --> 28:12.800
I thought
you must have been feeling

28:12.800 --> 28:15.300
What I had been feeling
with noah.

28:15.300 --> 28:17.200
And if I did
have feelings for vanessa,

28:17.200 --> 28:21.200
That would justify you being
angry at me all the time?

28:21.600 --> 28:23.900
I don't know why
she is so angry at me,

28:23.900 --> 28:26.000
At who I am.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.400
I mean, i... (sighs)

28:27.400 --> 28:31.200
I was in a band, I was young,
i was living that life, and...

28:31.200 --> 28:33.700
I settled down,

28:33.700 --> 28:37.200
And now the deal
is changing on me.

28:37.200 --> 28:41.100
I-I thought that was enough.
Why?

28:41.600 --> 28:45.600
It's a good question.

28:46.000 --> 28:46.800
Sarah?

28:46.800 --> 28:50.800
Because I want more.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.800
We're too young
to be freezing each other out,

28:53.800 --> 28:56.000
To not be having
passionate sex,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.400
To--To not have anything
to talk about,

28:58.400 --> 29:01.200
And I can't imagine

29:01.200 --> 29:05.200
Living the rest of my life
like this.

29:05.800 --> 29:09.900
We used to... be something.

29:12.100 --> 29:16.100
And I don't know
what's happened.

29:16.600 --> 29:19.700
I don't know.

29:19.700 --> 29:23.600
Can you tell me?
Can you tell me?

29:25.300 --> 29:28.000
Everybody
used to be something, sarah.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.600
I already have one
failed marriage under my belt.

29:30.600 --> 29:34.600
I'm doing the best
that I can here. I'm--I'm...

29:35.000 --> 29:37.300
Why the hell
can't you help us?!

29:37.300 --> 29:41.300
You sit there doing nothing!
We're drowning!

29:42.300 --> 29:45.900
I assumed you knew it was me
at the ranch that night.

29:45.900 --> 29:48.400
No, I didn't want to know
who it was.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.100
It was easier to convince myself
it hadn't happened.

29:51.100 --> 29:54.600
Your father asked me to go
with him to look at the winery.

29:54.600 --> 29:55.800
He wanted to buy it

29:55.800 --> 29:58.000
For the two of you
to work there together,

29:58.000 --> 30:01.900
But he was gonna
have to go into too much debt.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.200
It was too much of a risk,

30:03.200 --> 30:06.700
And he was afraid
that he would lose everything,

30:06.700 --> 30:09.800
Fail his family.

30:09.800 --> 30:13.800
Broke his heart.

30:14.600 --> 30:17.800
I-I told you
all of this already, tommy.

30:17.800 --> 30:20.500
He wanted you
to run the winery.

30:20.500 --> 30:24.300
Yeah..

30:24.300 --> 30:28.300
But now I believe you.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.900
(Kitty) what's this?
That's the first poll  they ever did

30:36.900 --> 30:39.100
When I ran for congress
a years ago.

30:39.100 --> 30:43.200
You're kidding.
Mm-Hmm.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.100
See?

30:46.100 --> 30:48.500
(Laughs) I was
twice as aloof as you.

30:48.500 --> 30:51.000
I totally kicked your ass
in aloof.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.200
Off the charts
in "inexperienced."

30:53.200 --> 30:56.500
"Callow, a lightweight,
a leftie, a commie,

30:56.500 --> 30:59.800
A right-Wing hawk, a psycho,
a pretty boy, a playboy--"

30:59.800 --> 31:02.100
"A hair candidate"?
(Sighs)

31:02.100 --> 31:03.200
What's that?
I don't know,

31:03.200 --> 31:06.600
But I won that election
with 62% of the vote.

31:06.600 --> 31:09.400
America doesn't know
what it wants, kitty.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.200
That's what the poll
is saying.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.700
They don't even know me yet,

31:12.700 --> 31:15.200
And that's why I hired you--
To cut through the crap

31:15.200 --> 31:17.400
And tell 'em who I am
and what I stand for.

31:17.400 --> 31:18.900
And trust me,

31:18.900 --> 31:22.900
You will never, ever
be a liability.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.100
Hmm.

31:31.100 --> 31:34.600
I hope not, because I really
like doi that a lot.

31:34.600 --> 31:36.500
Of course you do.
You're a strumpet.

31:36.500 --> 31:37.100
A slattern.
Right. Sorry.

31:37.100 --> 31:38.400
You have to go now.
Why?

31:38.400 --> 31:41.600
Because people are gonna think
we're doing it like weasels?

31:41.600 --> 31:44.400
Which is an image I cannot get out of my head, by the way.
Just go, go, go.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.700
I've--I've gotta make hair boy
look presidential.

31:47.700 --> 31:51.700
Senator hair boy. Please.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.400
(Sarah) you're telling me

31:56.400 --> 31:57.900
That you're going
into business with holly harper?

31:57.900 --> 31:59.200
What are you thinking?!

31:59.200 --> 32:01.200
This is like
a bad tommy joke, right?

32:01.200 --> 32:04.300
'Cause I'm really not
in the mood.
Sit down.

32:04.300 --> 32:05.200
I can't believe

32:05.200 --> 32:07.300
That you are seriously
thinking about this vineyard.

32:07.300 --> 32:11.100
Just sit down.

32:11.100 --> 32:15.100
Okay.

32:15.600 --> 32:19.600
Sarah, if I don't
take a risk now, I never will.

32:20.400 --> 32:23.500
I mean, I'll be just another kid
whose dad built a great business

32:23.500 --> 32:26.400
And who walked into it.

32:26.400 --> 32:29.600
I need to fail or succeed
at something on my own terms

32:29.600 --> 32:30.800
Before it's too late.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.100
You have an obligation
to ojai!
I have an obligation

32:34.100 --> 32:38.100
Our father might've created
this great business,

32:38.300 --> 32:40.200
But it doesn't mean
we have to be in lockstep,

32:40.200 --> 32:44.100
Caring for it at the expense
of our own dreams.

32:44.100 --> 32:46.800
I mean, is that what it means
to be family?

32:46.800 --> 32:50.800
Would you want that
for cooper or paige?

32:53.400 --> 32:57.000
Listen...

32:57.000 --> 32:58.800
You're gonnauy
all my interest in ojai foods.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.400
We can't--
Holly and i

33:00.400 --> 33:02.300
Are gonna take the proceeds
from the sale of the stock

33:02.300 --> 33:04.400
And buy greendale winery.

33:04.400 --> 33:07.300
I will stay on
as an employee,

33:07.300 --> 33:11.300
But the company...
it's yours now.

33:14.300 --> 33:18.300
And that's
what's happening, okay?

33:21.400 --> 33:23.200
And you'll stay on here?

33:23.200 --> 33:27.200
Yeah. I mean, if we can
start operations here... sure.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.200
I...

33:32.200 --> 33:36.200
I can't lose you, tommy,
and, um...

33:36.800 --> 33:40.800
I can't fight anymore,
not with anyone.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.200
You okay?

33:49.200 --> 33:50.900
No.

33:50.900 --> 33:54.500
But I don't wanna
talk about it, okay?

33:54.500 --> 33:58.500
I think you're crazy
to go into business with her.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.900
But I'll watch your back,

34:01.900 --> 34:05.900
And I'll drink your wine--
Probably all of it.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.500
And one more thing,
yocan tell her this,

34:08.500 --> 34:09.699
You can tell her

34:09.699 --> 34:12.500
That if she screwsith you,
i will kill her.

34:12.500 --> 34:16.500
I swear to god, I will.

34:16.699 --> 34:19.199
That's what I'm counting on.

34:19.199 --> 34:23.199
(Whispers) come here.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.400
Could we talk
before I go back to work?

34:35.400 --> 34:38.100
I've just had enough talk.

34:38.100 --> 34:41.600
In fact,
i've had enough therapy.

34:41.600 --> 34:45.600
I knew something was up
with noah.

34:46.600 --> 34:50.600
I'm not
going back there anymore.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.500
I promise
i won't let you down.

35:05.500 --> 35:09.500
We are gonna make beautiful wine
together, tommy.

35:10.400 --> 35:14.100
So we have a deal?

35:14.100 --> 35:17.500
(Laughs) is it all right if i
just jump up and down a little?

35:17.500 --> 35:18.900
I think that's allowed.

35:18.900 --> 35:21.500
Oh, your father
would be so proud of you!

35:21.500 --> 35:25.500
He's here with us.
He's watching us. I know it.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.400
I should--I should go.

35:27.400 --> 35:31.400
Oh, I'm sorry.   I-I didn't mean--
No, no, it's fine. It's fine.00:54:47.5:I'll see you at the office
tomorrow and we'll--

35:32.700 --> 35:35.900
(Knock on door)
(woman) it's me! Never mind,
the key's under the mat.

35:35.900 --> 35:39.900
Oh, no.

35:40.100 --> 35:43.000
The prodigal daughter returns...
a day early.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.400
Rebecca, I thought
you were coming tomorrow.

35:46.400 --> 35:46.900
Oh, my god.

35:46.900 --> 35:49.800
Yeah, i-I got a ride. I thought
it'd be a nice surprise.

35:49.800 --> 35:53.800
Oh, it... (laughs)
it--It's a wonderful surprise.

35:58.500 --> 36:01.400
I get the feeling
maybe my timing's a little off.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.400
I'm interrupting something.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.300
(Holly) no, no, no, it's okay.
Uh, this is tom walker.

36:05.300 --> 36:09.300
Hi.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.700
You're a little young
for my mom, aren't you?

36:11.700 --> 36:14.300
Rebecca.
We're business associates.

36:14.300 --> 36:18.300
Oh, of course.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.100
I-I-I should go.

36:22.100 --> 36:23.900
Yeah.
It was nice to meet you,
rebecca.

36:23.900 --> 36:27.900
Nice to meet you.

36:36.300 --> 36:40.300
My god, mom,
he's so cute!

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
(Knock on door)

36:47.000 --> 36:50.100
Five calls to you
unanswered.

36:50.100 --> 36:50.800
What did I do?

36:50.800 --> 36:53.300
I got a call,
and  wigged me out.

36:53.300 --> 36:55.400
Oh, god, michelle.
Yeah.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.500
Look, I thought she might.
She's just going throu--

36:57.500 --> 37:00.000
You'll forgive me
if I'm a little freaked.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.100
I mean, is this gonna be like
"fatal attraction"?

37:02.100 --> 37:06.100
Can I please just come in?
No.

37:07.100 --> 37:10.300
How many michelles
have there been?

37:10.300 --> 37:11.400
How many kevins?

37:11.400 --> 37:13.700
Yeah,
we know I have a history.
Yeah.

37:13.700 --> 37:15.900
I can't change that.
What a club--

37:15.900 --> 37:18.400
Schmucky men and women
who lose their minds around you

37:18.400 --> 37:21.300
And behave like
helpless morons.

37:21.300 --> 37:24.500
You're built to seduce and run,
chad. You can't help it.

37:24.500 --> 37:25.900
I just feel like
whatever I say,

37:25.900 --> 37:29.000
You're just gonna say
I'm an actor acting.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.600
What do I have to do
to prove to you

37:30.600 --> 37:34.100
That I'm trying to be in good faith with you?
Look, hamlet,

37:34.100 --> 37:37.300
I'm prepping a case, oy.
You can't distract me.

37:37.300 --> 37:39.600
I won't talk.

37:39.600 --> 37:42.600
I have lines to learn
for tomorrow.

37:42.600 --> 37:46.600
I save baltimore.

37:48.700 --> 37:51.600
So what's your case about?

37:51.600 --> 37:55.600
What they're all about--
Lies and broken promises.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.400
I hate you.

38:02.400 --> 38:06.400
Come in.

38:15.100 --> 38:16.300
Thank you.

38:16.300 --> 38:18.200
(Tommy) hey, everybody,
we have an announcement. Julia.

38:18.200 --> 38:22.000
Oh, uh, okay.
Well, um, here goes.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.300
We're adding two new walkers
to the lineup.

38:24.300 --> 38:25.600
Oh!
No way!

38:25.600 --> 38:27.500
(Laughs) oh, twins!
(Kevin) twins?!

38:27.500 --> 38:28.900
Yeah.
Oh, my goodness!

38:28.900 --> 38:30.600
(Kitty) oh, my god!

38:30.600 --> 38:32.100
We don't have any other twins
in the family.

38:32.100 --> 38:35.600
Okay, okay. Names, names, names.
We have to do names.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.300
We need both kinds.

38:37.300 --> 38:39.400
(Gasps) oh!
A boy and a girl?!

38:39.400 --> 38:40.300
Oh!

38:40.300 --> 38:41.500
I'm so happy! Yes!

38:41.500 --> 38:45.500
Does anyone think it's too early
for another william?

38:48.100 --> 38:52.100
Well, the world could always use
another william walker.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.500
Why can't you say anything,

38:57.500 --> 39:01.500
One thing
to make this feel better?

39:02.400 --> 39:04.700
There are no shortcuts,
sarah,

39:04.700 --> 39:08.500
In life or in love.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.300
This pain must be felt.

39:11.300 --> 39:13.800
The alternative
is much worse.

39:13.800 --> 39:16.100
It's what makes us special,

39:16.100 --> 39:17.400
What makes us beautiful,

39:17.400 --> 39:20.900
What... what makes us worthy,

39:20.900 --> 39:23.800
The--The pain
of how we love.

39:23.800 --> 39:27.000
But that pain is accompanied
by something else, isn't it?

39:27.000 --> 39:28.400
Hope.

39:28.400 --> 39:32.400
With your pain, there is hope,
and that is where you are...

39:33.800 --> 39:37.800
Somewhere between
agony and optimism and prayer.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.300
So you're human.

39:46.300 --> 39:50.000
You're alive.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.200
And that is what we have.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.100
Yeah.

39:54.100 --> 39:58.100
Come back tomorrow.
We'll go on.
