I expressed to your government or mine.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.444
And what exactly
do you want, Dr. Williams?

11:32.320 --> 11:36.564
Leopold spent the last seven years
getting control of the Congo.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.200
He used up his entire fortune
building that railroad of his,

11:39.360 --> 11:42.204
then shut off access
to 99% of the country.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.327
Why?

11:43.480 --> 11:45.482
Because he wants to be
the first monarch in history

who doesn't want people
to see his good deeds?

11:48.280 --> 11:49.964

the King is yet to pay for them.

How many are there?

53:16.560 --> 53:17.766
Twenty thousand.

They are mercenaries.
