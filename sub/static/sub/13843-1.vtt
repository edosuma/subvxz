WEBVTT

02:09.375 --> 02:13.833
DAYS OF GLORY

02:45.292 --> 02:48.124
We must rid France
of the German occupation!

02:48.375 --> 02:50.749
Come along! Come with me!

02:50.959 --> 02:54.291
We must wash the French flag
with our blood!

02:54.500 --> 02:55.999
Come with me!

02:56.334 --> 02:58.083
Let's have the men out!

02:58.292 --> 03:00.333
We must liberate France.

03:00.667 --> 03:01.958
Liberate her!

03:02.167 --> 03:05.374
We must save France
from this situation.

03:05.584 --> 03:06.583
Come on!

03:19.042 --> 03:20.249
Said!

03:22.042 --> 03:23.458
Come back!

03:28.250 --> 03:29.791
Be reasonable.

03:31.042 --> 03:32.416
Come back inside.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.833
Your grandfather never came back.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.291
Don't worry about me, Mother.

03:50.459 --> 03:52.499
I want to help France.

03:52.709 --> 03:54.833
I can manage.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.708
They'll kill you!

03:57.667 --> 04:00.583
I prefer the worst poverty
to losing you.

04:04.125 --> 04:06.083
You put up with too much.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.624
Please, let me go.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.416
It will be all right, Mother.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.249
Pray for me.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.291
Get in.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.791
Move!

04:38.084 --> 04:39.833
Long live France!

04:43.959 --> 04:45.916
Get in.

05:17.750 --> 05:21.833
MOROCCO - 1943

05:35.084 --> 05:37.041
Left turn!

05:44.167 --> 05:47.499
I know that you Ait Tserouchen,
the mountain men,

05:48.209 --> 05:50.666
are the French army's best fighters,

05:51.167 --> 05:53.291
better than the other Berbers,

05:53.709 --> 05:55.416
and you'll prove it!

05:56.500 --> 05:58.124
Listen carefully now.

05:58.375 --> 06:01.624
We permit raids in enemy territory
for food.

06:01.959 --> 06:04.416
But hands off the women
or you'll be shot.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.291
in France, no raids at all.

06:07.625 --> 06:09.333
We show discipline!

06:09.542 --> 06:11.499
it’s our home, our motherland!

06:15.542 --> 06:17.666
Left turn!

06:20.542 --> 06:23.208
Yassir, they make us
march like mules.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.124
Let's go back home.

06:25.292 --> 06:27.749
Serve France with pride.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.958
Why did you get us enlisted?

06:30.042 --> 06:31.583
Forth money.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.499
So we can marry you off.

06:34.875 --> 06:37.333
Forward... March!

06:42.792 --> 06:46.124
The sergeant communicates
with his men...

06:48.959 --> 06:50.749
through verbal orders...

06:52.375 --> 06:54.874
and through signals...

06:55.792 --> 06:59.041
through verbal orders
and through signals...

06:59.417 --> 07:01.208
used simultaneously.

07:07.792 --> 07:11.208
We're the men of Africa
Come here from afar

07:11.417 --> 07:15.249
We've come from the colonies
To save the fatherland

07:15.375 --> 07:18.124
We've left behind
Our families and homes

07:18.959 --> 07:21.791
And our hearts are full
Of invincible fervour

07:22.334 --> 07:25.791
For we wish to bear high and proud

07:26.084 --> 07:29.416
The cherished flag of sweet France

07:29.959 --> 07:33.291
Should someone try to part us

07:33.750 --> 07:37.249
We're here to die at her feet

07:37.417 --> 07:40.999
Drums roll to mark our love
For our country and I and

07:41.250 --> 07:44.666
We've come from afar to die
We're the men of Africa

07:44.917 --> 07:46.624
At ease!

08:58.834 --> 08:59.833
Company...

09:00.959 --> 09:02.166
Halt!

09:03.125 --> 09:04.416
Left turn!

09:14.625 --> 09:16.208
Don't salute me here.

09:17.709 --> 09:20.541
They always pick officers as targets.

09:21.292 --> 09:26.333
Corporal Abd-el-Kader, 2nd Company,
7th Algerian infantry Regiment,

09:26.917 --> 09:28.458
reporting, sir!

09:30.625 --> 09:32.166
What can your lads do?

09:32.792 --> 09:35.374
No idea, sir, they're my first group.

09:36.334 --> 09:37.874
You got your rank how?

09:38.292 --> 09:40.249
I passed the exam, sir.

09:43.209 --> 09:44.833
I took mine with the Krauts.

09:55.709 --> 09:58.083
Corporal Leroux reporting, sir.

10:16.584 --> 10:18.458
You can go.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.458
Praise be to God.

10:30.667 --> 10:33.999
Take this. it’s a German rifle.
The best.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.083
You'll be the marksman.

10:44.334 --> 10:45.333
Take it.

10:51.542 --> 10:52.749
Hit the ground!

11:24.667 --> 11:25.833
Don't blame him, sir.

11:27.209 --> 11:28.583
They're still green.

11:33.709 --> 11:36.374
I have the power
of life and death over you!

11:40.584 --> 11:42.374
Starting with you.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.791
Yes, sir.

12:00.167 --> 12:02.874
The Germans are dug in up there.
At ease.

12:04.917 --> 12:07.916
Our mission
is to climb up to the Krauts

12:08.084 --> 12:09.958
to flush them out.

12:10.084 --> 12:11.791
We have to do it.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.124
It's a Eight infantry job.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.208
You'll lead the men.

12:22.292 --> 12:25.291
Any trouble, take out a cigarette.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.791
Before you light it,
it'll be over.

12:28.042 --> 12:29.499
Yes, sir.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.916
- it reassures the lads behind.
- Yes, sir.

12:54.459 --> 12:56.833
Hitting a soldier isn't allowed.

12:57.042 --> 12:59.708
I know the sergeant well.
He's a good man.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.208
He knows his job.

13:06.709 --> 13:07.999
Where are you from, Said?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.291
From total poverty.

13:15.084 --> 13:16.458
Listen...

13:16.834 --> 13:18.416
in that uniform

13:18.625 --> 13:20.166
you're like me now,

13:20.459 --> 13:22.416
you're like all of us.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.958
We're the same family.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.333
The army means equality.

13:28.542 --> 13:29.833
Wait a while.

13:30.375 --> 13:33.041
You’ll get
your share of bullets tomorrow.

13:40.750 --> 13:41.916
Corporal,

13:42.750 --> 13:43.749
are you afraid?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.624
Enough talk.

13:56.167 --> 13:57.791
Tomorrow, you’ll know...

13:58.959 --> 14:00.499
if you’re soldiers or not.

14:16.875 --> 14:19.166
Your coffee, sarge.

14:21.417 --> 14:23.208
Thank you, Ali.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.041
Careful, it's hot.

14:33.125 --> 14:35.166
We’ll be in for it tomorrow.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.958
Yes, we'll be in for it.

14:40.959 --> 14:42.124
Inch’ Allah.

15:03.875 --> 15:07.708
O Merciful, Compassionate
Lord of the Worlds,

15:07.959 --> 15:10.958
Merciful, Compassionate King
of Judgement Day,

15:11.167 --> 15:13.624
You alone we worship
and seek help from.

15:13.792 --> 15:15.999
Guide us along the right path...

16:26.959 --> 16:29.416
I declare
there is no deity but God.

16:29.625 --> 16:32.791
I declare
that Mohammad is his prophet.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.708
Move forward!

17:26.167 --> 17:28.541
Abd-el-Kader, move!

17:30.250 --> 17:31.416
Abd-el-Kader!

17:31.667 --> 17:32.666
Corporal!

17:34.250 --> 17:35.416
What do we do?

17:36.292 --> 17:37.499
Shut up!

17:41.625 --> 17:42.791
Move.

17:43.042 --> 17:44.666
We'll die if we stay here.

18:02.750 --> 18:04.708
Messaoud! Ahmed!

18:04.917 --> 18:05.916
Said!

18:06.292 --> 18:08.249
Let's go!

18:41.084 --> 18:42.791
Colonel, the artillery!

18:48.792 --> 18:50.499
Battery number 5.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.999
938-991.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.958
Battery number 5.
Position 938-991.

18:58.334 --> 19:01.416
- Copy.
- 903-940.

19:01.500 --> 19:04.499
Battery number4.
Position 903-940.

19:07.292 --> 19:09.333
Bearing 1 400, order 340.

19:09.584 --> 19:11.458
Charge 5. Loaded.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.874
- First gun ready.
- Second gun ready.

19:13.959 --> 19:15.166
Attention... Fire!

19:25.167 --> 19:26.541
Stay down! That's our side.

20:29.792 --> 20:31.166
Larbi...

20:34.459 --> 20:36.416
Don't be afraid, little brother.

20:37.042 --> 20:39.333
We're not going to die today.

20:59.834 --> 21:01.791
Let's go, Messaoud!

21:03.334 --> 21:05.999
Move forward! Keep going!

21:16.875 --> 21:17.874
Sergeant!

21:18.167 --> 21:19.624
Stay behind me.

21:28.792 --> 21:30.166
Alim are you hurt?

22:17.292 --> 22:18.916
Keep going!

22:47.042 --> 22:48.499
Come out of there!

22:58.792 --> 23:00.249
Open his mouth.

23:04.125 --> 23:05.291
Stop that!

23:05.917 --> 23:06.999
What are you doing?

23:08.209 --> 23:10.416
We're soldiers, not savages.

23:11.167 --> 23:13.541
- Fuck you!
- Scum!

23:19.875 --> 23:22.249
We're pulling out!

23:40.000 --> 23:41.708
Long live France!

25:07.375 --> 25:08.833
Colonel...

25:09.834 --> 25:11.208
How many casualties?

25:12.167 --> 25:13.374
How many dead?

25:14.417 --> 25:16.374
it’s a magnificent victory.

25:16.750 --> 25:19.416
Forth first time
since the 1940 defeat,

25:19.834 --> 25:22.208
our army has defeated the Germans.

25:22.875 --> 25:26.124
France has regained glory
and the Allies' trust.

25:26.209 --> 25:27.291
Write that.

25:28.084 --> 25:29.624
A photo, colonel.

25:32.834 --> 25:34.041
Write what I said.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.124
Let's go.

27:09.334 --> 27:10.791
Lower...

27:14.792 --> 27:16.249
That's it!

27:21.250 --> 27:22.416
Yes?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.208
At ease.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.374
What do you want?

27:35.375 --> 27:38.624
I come to say thank you.

27:39.584 --> 27:41.708
You save my life, sergeant.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.458
You want to thank me?

27:44.167 --> 27:46.708
Make some coffee.
You can replace Ali.

27:47.334 --> 27:49.916
I'll make you a private
if I’m pleased.

28:02.084 --> 28:04.124
Well? What did he say?

28:04.500 --> 28:06.374
Are we going home?

28:06.500 --> 28:08.708
- Soon!
- Is it true?

28:09.209 --> 28:11.624
Thank you, my friend.

28:12.500 --> 28:13.874
Where's my chocolate?

28:16.292 --> 28:17.749
- Here.
- Thank you.

28:30.459 --> 28:31.916
No tomatoes for you.

28:35.042 --> 28:37.083
- Why?
- They're notorious. Move!

28:40.417 --> 28:42.041
What do you mean?

28:43.750 --> 28:45.041
Let go of him!

28:50.542 --> 28:52.916
You're cooking while he fights.

28:53.084 --> 28:54.458
Yes, sir.

28:56.417 --> 28:57.708
Move.

29:02.542 --> 29:05.124
Why aren't the tomatoes for everyone?

29:05.584 --> 29:06.749
He's right.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.374
We want tomatoes too!

29:11.459 --> 29:12.833
He's right!

29:15.084 --> 29:16.624
Shut your mouths!

29:22.375 --> 29:23.999
You're not happy?

29:52.584 --> 29:54.708
No one will have any now...

29:55.209 --> 29:56.833
Sergeant.

30:14.459 --> 30:18.666
They're ready to die for us
but any injustice will cause mutiny.

30:18.917 --> 30:21.041
You know the natives, Martinez...

30:21.209 --> 30:22.374
Avoid that term, sir.

30:22.584 --> 30:24.374
- The Muslims...
- That’s just as bad.

30:24.542 --> 30:26.166
So what do I call them?

30:26.334 --> 30:28.833
The men, sir. The men.

30:43.917 --> 30:45.291
What's going on here?

30:45.459 --> 30:46.999
Sir,

30:47.167 --> 30:50.333
we fight alongside
our French brothers in arms

30:51.209 --> 30:54.541
on the same terrain,
against the same enemy.

30:55.709 --> 30:57.999
We must share the tomatoes too.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.958
German bullets
don't pick and choose, sir.

31:08.084 --> 31:10.458
Sergeant, when we have tomatoes

31:11.209 --> 31:12.874
let everyone have them.

31:13.625 --> 31:14.958
Yes, sir.

31:15.667 --> 31:16.958
Thank you, sir.

31:25.834 --> 31:28.499
My boys... My dear boys!

31:29.417 --> 31:32.249
The dream for which so many have died

31:33.209 --> 31:35.249
is coming true at last!

31:36.667 --> 31:39.833
Your wounds and suffering
all the pain

31:40.375 --> 31:42.249
and bloodshed

31:42.417 --> 31:45.416
are the price to pay
to be on this journey.

31:45.625 --> 31:49.041
We shall soon see France again!
The motherland!

31:49.500 --> 31:50.874
We are going home!

32:38.625 --> 32:43.249
PROVENCE - AUGUST 1944

33:40.209 --> 33:41.499
Smell it.

33:44.125 --> 33:46.249
- it’s not like at home.
- No.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.374
French soil is better.

33:52.459 --> 33:53.749
Look!

33:56.167 --> 33:57.874
Long live France!

34:08.250 --> 34:09.624
France!

34:51.084 --> 34:52.333
Do you speak French?

34:52.584 --> 34:54.208
Yes, I understand it.

34:55.250 --> 34:57.291
- What's your name?
- Messaoud.

34:59.667 --> 35:01.624
And what's your name?

35:02.042 --> 35:03.166
Irene.

35:13.084 --> 35:14.958
The sergeant says,

35:15.209 --> 35:16.624
"Go up the mountain."

35:16.917 --> 35:20.416
I was scared
but I go up the mountain.

35:20.625 --> 35:23.124
I go up the mountain I run and run.

35:23.417 --> 35:26.416
Messaoud to my right,
Abdelkaderto my left.

35:26.584 --> 35:28.541
I’m not scared then.

35:30.542 --> 35:34.333
But Germany shoots at us.
Left, right, everywhere it shoots.

35:34.625 --> 35:37.374
Messaoud says,
"Lie down in the hole."

35:37.875 --> 35:40.708
I don't speak.
The sergeant looks at me,

35:40.792 --> 35:42.333
I look at the sergeant.

35:42.500 --> 35:44.291
I know what he wants.

35:44.917 --> 35:49.041
I take the grenade pull the pin
and throw it at Germany.

35:50.584 --> 35:52.124
All of Germany, they die.

35:59.292 --> 36:02.708
I free a country, it's my country.

36:04.084 --> 36:06.374
Even if I never saw it before.

36:06.542 --> 36:07.999
it’s my country.

36:08.584 --> 36:10.458
Your country's all you like?

36:12.209 --> 36:15.708
Inch'Allahm we'll beat Germany.
Thank you very much.

37:11.375 --> 37:12.374
Look.

37:12.792 --> 37:15.458
Iron Cross. German.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.291
Very beautiful.

37:19.084 --> 37:21.041
Dangerous soldier...

37:22.667 --> 37:24.041
Take this.

37:27.167 --> 37:28.791
Good quality!

37:30.209 --> 37:31.666
iron Cross.

38:29.834 --> 38:31.124
Unlucky

38:35.834 --> 38:37.958
Why unlucky?

38:39.750 --> 38:41.999
I didn't know you.

38:45.709 --> 38:46.874
Sorry.

38:47.042 --> 38:48.333
Good night.

38:51.084 --> 38:52.458
Why were you scared?

38:56.167 --> 38:58.624
The Germans won't be back.

39:00.542 --> 39:02.249
You wiped them out.

39:04.459 --> 39:06.249
it’s not that.

39:07.167 --> 39:08.624
But...

39:10.584 --> 39:14.333
in my country,
we don't go with French women.

40:31.750 --> 40:32.749
Leave it!

40:34.334 --> 40:35.791
Don't touch it!

40:36.334 --> 40:38.041
it’s a sin!

40:38.459 --> 40:39.916
I swear in God's name.

40:40.250 --> 40:41.874
Aren't you ashamed?

40:43.042 --> 40:45.249
Why, Yassir?
is it God's?

40:49.625 --> 40:50.708
Don't touch it.

40:51.542 --> 40:52.916
All right.

41:12.167 --> 41:13.249
Look.

41:16.459 --> 41:19.624
Their God suffered a lot.

41:20.459 --> 41:21.833
A lot.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.624
Tell me, Yassir...

41:28.375 --> 41:30.416
When I was little,

41:30.584 --> 41:33.708
the French soldiers
killed our whole family.

41:35.459 --> 41:37.416
Did they massacre them?

41:39.042 --> 41:40.999
What did they call it?

41:41.834 --> 41:43.374
They called it...

41:44.084 --> 41:45.708
Pacification.

41:47.084 --> 41:48.791
Pacification?

42:14.292 --> 42:16.749
Corporal, can you read?

42:17.125 --> 42:18.583
Yes.

42:22.500 --> 42:24.541
I can't read.

42:25.875 --> 42:27.333
I never went to school.

42:29.042 --> 42:30.499
You can learn.

42:31.334 --> 42:32.499
Listen, Said...

42:47.334 --> 42:49.749
Corporal, come here!

42:58.667 --> 42:59.666
What's that?

43:00.792 --> 43:02.916
it’s a military handbook, sir.

43:03.542 --> 43:05.666
"The Infantry NCOs’ Handbook".

43:06.417 --> 43:08.124
You want to be a colonel?

43:08.250 --> 43:10.708
A sergeant first, sir.

43:14.209 --> 43:16.083
Let me read you an extract.

43:18.500 --> 43:19.708
"in theory,

43:20.167 --> 43:24.208
no soldier should return home
illiterate from the army.

43:26.625 --> 43:29.166
Classes are obligatory for all men

43:29.334 --> 43:31.083
on their enlistment."

43:33.084 --> 43:37.124
Yet none of these African troops
can read or write.

43:41.917 --> 43:43.541
You want to learn to read?

43:49.417 --> 43:51.458
it’s too late, sir.

43:53.792 --> 43:55.249
And to read what?

44:09.250 --> 44:11.124
Give me a clean shirt.

44:23.334 --> 44:24.708
You’ll come back?

44:25.667 --> 44:27.791
Yes, I promise, I come back.

44:28.709 --> 44:29.708
You wait for me?

44:30.667 --> 44:31.666
Yes.

45:00.084 --> 45:05.416
RHONE VALLEY - OCTOBER 1944

45:28.542 --> 45:30.666
I never loved a girl like this.

45:31.917 --> 45:35.666
I want to marry her,
have kids and make a family.

45:36.625 --> 45:38.166
You get worked up fast.

45:38.375 --> 45:40.958
Marseilles is paradise.
Here, corporal,

45:41.167 --> 45:43.916
they respect me. I’m not a wog.

45:44.750 --> 45:47.208
I swear!
I make my life in France.

45:47.417 --> 45:48.708
You’ll always be a wog.

45:48.917 --> 45:51.833
Shut it!
Overslept in sheets before?

45:52.292 --> 45:53.833
Said! Get in!

45:55.834 --> 45:56.999
Get in.

46:09.709 --> 46:11.333
Aicha!

46:46.750 --> 46:48.458
Me and mother 1903

47:01.750 --> 47:03.458
What is this shit?

47:04.459 --> 47:06.499
Only you French guys get leave?

47:06.792 --> 47:09.083
- We've fought since Marseilles.
- Us, Italy.

47:09.417 --> 47:13.166
We're off to Paris.
You need to get back to wog land.

47:14.459 --> 47:16.583
The wog fucks you.

47:33.042 --> 47:35.333
You miss home? Your family?

47:40.792 --> 47:42.166
Why speak Arabic?

47:47.292 --> 47:51.041
Me too, I like to go leave
to see my mother.

47:59.084 --> 48:02.333
- Any mail for me?
- There's no mail for you.

48:02.500 --> 48:05.249
You must look again. it’s not normal.

48:05.459 --> 48:07.666
I wrote three times.
Messaoud Souni.

48:07.834 --> 48:11.166
- Or maybe I’m listed as dead.
- I said no.

48:11.375 --> 48:14.749
- Private!
- There's nothing for you.

48:26.709 --> 48:28.083
Here's Aicha!

48:32.125 --> 48:33.499
How is she?

48:34.500 --> 48:36.874
Has Sergeant Martinez repudiated you?

48:37.084 --> 48:38.958
Marrying a Moroccan?

48:41.625 --> 48:43.249
Why are you getting at me?

48:44.667 --> 48:46.374
Go to your Marseilles girl.

48:46.584 --> 48:49.416
An American's
probably banging her now.

48:50.792 --> 48:52.041
it doesn't matter.

48:52.250 --> 48:53.708
You know why?

48:53.917 --> 48:54.999
Here...

48:55.209 --> 48:57.416
you're the one we want, Aicha.

48:59.250 --> 49:00.583
Our beautiful Aicha.

49:02.667 --> 49:04.041
She takes care of us.

49:07.542 --> 49:09.249
As God is my witness...

49:09.625 --> 49:10.999
Said, calm down!

49:12.167 --> 49:14.624
if ever you call me Aicha again...

49:17.917 --> 49:19.083
If one of you...

49:20.292 --> 49:22.333
No problem, my brother.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.083
Everyone has understood.

49:25.584 --> 49:27.499
Stop it.

49:27.667 --> 49:29.249
Leave him be. Calm down.

49:29.500 --> 49:31.124
if anyone calls me Aicha,

49:31.667 --> 49:32.833
I’ll kill him.

49:35.209 --> 49:36.208
Let go of him.

49:36.625 --> 49:39.208
- I’m not a child!
- Let go of him!

49:39.459 --> 49:40.999
Let go of him!

49:42.709 --> 49:44.166
You're mad!

49:47.167 --> 49:50.166
Are you soldiers,
idiots or what?

49:50.250 --> 49:53.249
Shame on you!

49:55.209 --> 49:57.166
Get out of here!

49:58.334 --> 50:00.374
Get out! Go on!

50:00.834 --> 50:01.916
Hurry it up!

50:03.959 --> 50:05.583
Don’t try that again!

50:05.959 --> 50:07.416
Listen to me, you.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.708
You're not a slave.

50:10.459 --> 50:12.458
There are no slaves here!

50:13.375 --> 50:15.666
No one has bothered about me here.

50:15.875 --> 50:17.833
Except the sergeant.

50:22.209 --> 50:25.958
Learn your book by heart
to become a colonel.

50:27.417 --> 50:29.208
Who's becoming a colonel?

50:29.417 --> 50:31.208
This donkey?

50:31.625 --> 50:33.291
This mule?

50:34.084 --> 50:36.999
Why wouldn’t they become colonels?

50:38.500 --> 50:39.499
Why not him?

50:39.709 --> 50:42.166
And even him?

50:44.750 --> 50:46.083
We can try.

50:50.709 --> 50:51.958
So try!

50:56.417 --> 50:58.041
it’s over!

50:58.209 --> 51:00.333
Get to your bunks!

51:00.459 --> 51:01.999
Do it!

51:03.584 --> 51:06.416
I want no more trouble!

51:13.459 --> 51:18.333
THE VOSGES - NOVEMBER 1944

51:31.209 --> 51:32.999
Yes, it looks ugly!

51:33.167 --> 51:35.124
it’ll be even worse in there!

51:36.667 --> 51:38.791
it’ll be tougher than Italy.

51:39.250 --> 51:40.999
But I have faith in you.

51:42.250 --> 51:45.833
I have faith in you
to liberate your homeland.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.083
The French have placed their fate
in our hands

51:51.250 --> 51:54.499
and are watching us
with eyes full of hope.

51:57.042 --> 51:59.166
We have to be up there by dark!

51:59.334 --> 52:02.666
And, even dead, we shall be!
Even dead!

53:05.542 --> 53:07.166
is it Omar, sir?

53:19.542 --> 53:20.916
Sir...

53:21.084 --> 53:23.374
I've taken the position.

53:25.834 --> 53:27.791
l'm here, sir.

53:30.375 --> 53:31.833
l'm in charge here!

53:32.042 --> 53:35.874
I ordered you to regroup,
not to head off on your own!

53:36.584 --> 53:39.583
I give the orders.
Look where it's got us!

53:40.209 --> 53:42.083
We've lost Omar!

53:48.959 --> 53:52.708
Go to say we’ve taken the position
and request orders.

53:54.084 --> 53:55.541
Yes, sir.

54:26.750 --> 54:27.916
Sir?

54:30.875 --> 54:32.749
I have news for you Said.

54:33.334 --> 54:35.124
You're promoted private.

54:35.334 --> 54:36.874
You're transferred to HQ.

54:37.042 --> 54:38.958
Take your pack and go there.

54:40.834 --> 54:43.666
I don’t want to be private, sarge.

54:45.584 --> 54:48.124
l'm fine like I am now.

54:50.084 --> 54:51.624
I was kidding!

55:07.584 --> 55:09.541
Learn to fend for yourself.

55:10.459 --> 55:12.249
I might die one day.

55:16.584 --> 55:18.874
You're not going to die, sarge.

55:19.375 --> 55:21.166
You not say that ever.

55:23.875 --> 55:26.249
You're going to be alive

55:26.417 --> 55:28.708
to become captain, inch’ Allah.

55:30.500 --> 55:32.624
Captain's too much paperwork.

55:50.625 --> 55:52.749
Are French girls like this, sir?

55:54.042 --> 55:57.708
She says she's with you for life
and then forgets you.

55:58.209 --> 55:59.833
is that how it is here?

56:00.834 --> 56:03.916
When you get promoted,
pick a rich pretty one.

56:05.292 --> 56:07.083
She's beautiful, corporal.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.791
Look at the photo

56:12.209 --> 56:15.208
and tell me what you think.
Tell me the truth.

56:15.375 --> 56:17.416
Is she serious or not serious?

56:18.000 --> 56:20.124
- What's her name?
- Irene.

56:20.584 --> 56:21.958
Irene's a pretty name.

56:25.125 --> 56:29.249
We have to see this war out.
We'll return in honour.

56:29.459 --> 56:31.333
Irene will be proud of you.

56:49.084 --> 56:50.458
Listen to this.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.291
"After the war, I return, Irene.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.458
I send you kisses. I think of you

56:56.792 --> 56:58.833
day and night. Messaoud."

56:59.500 --> 57:01.541
- Pretty, huh?
- it’s like a song.

57:02.959 --> 57:04.041
CENSORED

57:09.500 --> 57:11.624
They're not idiots, sir.

57:12.125 --> 57:15.624
They've been away 20 months,
they're freezing here...

57:15.792 --> 57:16.958
I know, sergeant!

57:17.167 --> 57:19.833
- The French get leave.
- No ships!

57:20.042 --> 57:22.083
There were ships to bring them

57:22.292 --> 57:24.666
but none to send them on leave?

57:25.709 --> 57:27.833
We'd like to see our families,

57:28.000 --> 57:30.583
like the mainland French.
it’s unfair.

57:32.584 --> 57:36.624
And the French get promotion
before anyone from North Africa!

57:36.834 --> 57:40.749
You're doing good work.
I'll put you up for promotion.

57:41.125 --> 57:44.874
I don’t want it.
My men deserve it as much as me.

57:44.959 --> 57:46.999
Corporal Abd-el-Kader, for instance.

58:08.209 --> 58:09.291
Don't sleep.

58:09.542 --> 58:11.249
Wake up! Get up!

58:54.917 --> 58:55.916
God rest his soul.

59:43.209 --> 59:44.833
What's this?

59:45.167 --> 59:47.124
What does it say?

59:47.334 --> 59:49.124
Read it.

59:51.834 --> 59:53.708
"Muslim soldier,

59:54.250 --> 59:58.291
know that you can cross
to the German side

59:58.709 --> 1:00:01.166
where you will be warmly welcomed

1:00:01.917 --> 1:00:03.791
and your life saved.

1:00:04.125 --> 1:00:07.958
Your leaders send you to die
rather than the French.

1:00:10.667 --> 1:00:13.208
Muslim soldier,

1:00:13.417 --> 1:00:15.208
you weren't born into slavery.

1:00:16.625 --> 1:00:19.374
Germany will give you your freedom.

1:00:22.459 --> 1:00:25.374
The day of independence
has come for Africa."

1:00:27.625 --> 1:00:31.041
What would you do without us,
Abd-el-Kader?

1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.041
You have something in mind?

1:00:37.959 --> 1:00:39.166
Out with it,

1:00:39.417 --> 1:00:40.666
man to man.

1:00:42.750 --> 1:00:45.916
De Gaulle said
we're fighting for liberty.

1:00:46.417 --> 1:00:50.624
l'm fighting with France
against Nazism.

1:01:27.917 --> 1:01:29.458
Come out of your holes!

1:01:29.917 --> 1:01:31.791
We have leave!

1:01:34.417 --> 1:01:35.499
Come out!

1:01:35.584 --> 1:01:36.583
We have leave!

1:01:37.167 --> 1:01:38.791
We're going home.

1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.291
These aren’t to go home in.

1:02:22.417 --> 1:02:25.249
There’ll be dancers tonight!

1:02:41.209 --> 1:02:42.999
She hasn’t written back.

1:02:44.792 --> 1:02:46.583
Be patient.

1:02:46.750 --> 1:02:49.416
There's a war on.
The mail hasn't arrived.

1:02:49.625 --> 1:02:52.374
It has. There was nothing for me.

1:02:54.667 --> 1:02:55.999
Leroux! Martinez!

1:02:58.334 --> 1:03:02.208
Martinez, you're promoted
to staff sergeant. Bravo.

1:03:02.834 --> 1:03:03.833
Thank you, sir.

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.333
And you're a sergeant now, Leroux.
Congratulations.

1:03:09.084 --> 1:03:10.249
Try to find stripes.

1:03:12.334 --> 1:03:13.708
Well done, Leroux.

1:03:14.042 --> 1:03:15.999
Thank you, staff sergeant.

1:03:23.250 --> 1:03:24.333
Messaoud!

1:03:25.750 --> 1:03:28.749
The girls will go wild for you
in those boots!

1:03:33.209 --> 1:03:35.499
Do you like your coat, corporal?

1:03:35.834 --> 1:03:37.458
Yes, I suppose.

1:03:46.167 --> 1:03:47.166
God preserve you.

1:03:49.125 --> 1:03:50.624
Amen.

1:04:24.209 --> 1:04:27.291
He's wearing me out!
I have to go.

1:04:30.292 --> 1:04:31.916
Here I am!

1:04:32.459 --> 1:04:33.833
Sit yourself down.

1:04:40.750 --> 1:04:42.208
Whisky?

1:04:42.625 --> 1:04:44.416
Like America.

1:04:53.209 --> 1:04:55.333
Sorry, sarge, it burns!

1:04:59.250 --> 1:05:00.791
Just a second.

1:05:15.375 --> 1:05:16.833
Have a cigar.

1:05:18.125 --> 1:05:20.791
- is it for me?
- Of course it's for you.

1:05:23.750 --> 1:05:25.124
You know,

1:05:26.750 --> 1:05:28.624
I don't usually smoke cigars

1:05:28.875 --> 1:05:30.333
but I will now.

1:05:34.500 --> 1:05:36.124
I like you, Said.

1:05:38.917 --> 1:05:40.208
Me too, sarge.

1:05:41.625 --> 1:05:42.749
I like you.

1:05:43.709 --> 1:05:45.208
You deserve promotion.

1:05:47.667 --> 1:05:50.499
The whole unit does.
But they can't see that.

1:05:51.834 --> 1:05:54.291
They can't tell, they don't know us.

1:05:59.334 --> 1:06:02.416
We'll liberate the country
and go home.

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:10.999
But, sarge...

1:06:11.500 --> 1:06:16.291
Here too is our home.

1:06:16.875 --> 1:06:18.041
it’s France.

1:06:18.542 --> 1:06:21.208
We're fighting for her,
for the motherland.

1:06:21.875 --> 1:06:24.083
Here is our home and I know

1:06:25.500 --> 1:06:27.999
you're like us too...

1:06:30.834 --> 1:06:32.291
An Arab.

1:06:34.334 --> 1:06:35.874
What did you just say?

1:06:37.459 --> 1:06:41.124
I see the photo of your mother
in the shirt.

1:06:44.125 --> 1:06:45.166
it’s incredible.

1:06:45.375 --> 1:06:48.791
Put the photo of your mother

1:06:49.334 --> 1:06:53.166
next to the photo of my mother,
they look like two sisters.

1:06:53.375 --> 1:06:55.749
You searched my things, bastard!

1:07:00.542 --> 1:07:02.833
Shit-stirrer! Scum!

1:07:06.667 --> 1:07:09.999
Never talk about that again
or I’ll kill you.

1:07:11.459 --> 1:07:12.833
Get lost!

1:07:49.125 --> 1:07:50.416
Fall in! Attention!

1:08:04.292 --> 1:08:05.291
At ease!

1:09:41.625 --> 1:09:43.499
What is this shit?

1:09:46.375 --> 1:09:47.583
Sit down!

1:09:55.125 --> 1:09:58.374
l'm taking my leave!
l'm off to Marseilles.

1:10:20.084 --> 1:10:23.499
With her potatoes
And mouldy beans

1:10:23.584 --> 1:10:26.499
France is our mother
She feeds us

1:10:26.792 --> 1:10:28.166
Listen!

1:10:32.209 --> 1:10:34.749
Listen to me, my brothers!

1:10:36.375 --> 1:10:40.041
When I enlisted,
I listened to De Gaulle.

1:10:40.750 --> 1:10:44.666
He said France was fighting
for freedom around the world.

1:10:44.917 --> 1:10:49.874
I thought the war would give us
the rights of our French brothers.

1:10:50.792 --> 1:10:53.541
We're all fighting against Hitler

1:10:53.750 --> 1:10:56.333
for liberty, equality and fraternity.

1:10:58.750 --> 1:11:02.249
it’s high time they gave us
some of that Liberty,

1:11:02.417 --> 1:11:05.666
that equality
and, above all, that fraternity!

1:11:20.917 --> 1:11:23.583
We're changing the destiny of France!

1:11:25.709 --> 1:11:27.749
Things must change for us too!

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:29.374
Stand aside!

1:11:31.709 --> 1:11:33.083
You're asking for it!

1:11:33.292 --> 1:11:35.958
You keep stirring up shit
all the time!

1:11:36.209 --> 1:11:38.166
The French reward themselves,

1:11:38.375 --> 1:11:40.333
then you French North Africans,

1:11:40.542 --> 1:11:42.583
and the Africans are forgotten.

1:11:42.709 --> 1:11:43.708
There are quotas.

1:11:46.500 --> 1:11:48.041
Quotas?

1:11:49.542 --> 1:11:51.249
Why didn't you tell us?

1:11:52.250 --> 1:11:55.666
You can't understand,
so shut up and step down!

1:11:55.875 --> 1:11:59.999
Why can't I understand?
A wog has less of a brain than you?

1:12:00.375 --> 1:12:03.124
Wogs aren't cut out to lead men.

1:12:07.292 --> 1:12:09.416
That day will come, sergeant.

1:12:09.959 --> 1:12:12.874
Sorry, staff sergeant.

1:12:41.209 --> 1:12:42.999
What are you doing here?

1:12:44.375 --> 1:12:46.833
I tried to get to Marseilles.

1:12:48.375 --> 1:12:52.124
The French get leave, we get nothing.
is that normal?

1:12:53.125 --> 1:12:54.499
is it normal?

1:12:54.834 --> 1:12:56.624
You tried to desert.

1:12:57.209 --> 1:12:58.458
Are you crazy?

1:12:59.875 --> 1:13:01.666
I have to see her.

1:13:06.584 --> 1:13:08.791
Why are you here, corporal?

1:13:11.417 --> 1:13:15.874
I had a fight with Martinez,
the staff sergeant.

1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:22.958
- Got a Gauloise?
- Yes.

1:13:29.417 --> 1:13:33.791
They're on the front.
Their position is top secret.

1:13:34.292 --> 1:13:35.666
Write to him.

1:13:37.167 --> 1:13:40.791
I already have, several times.
There's been no reply.

1:13:47.459 --> 1:13:48.749
Tell me...

1:13:50.584 --> 1:13:52.041
is he dead?

1:13:53.834 --> 1:13:56.124
Give me his name. We'll find out.

1:13:57.667 --> 1:14:00.124
Messaoud Souni.

1:14:01.792 --> 1:14:04.958
He's with
the 7th Algerian infantry Regiment.

1:14:08.125 --> 1:14:10.791
if we hear anything,
we'll let you know.

1:14:12.959 --> 1:14:14.416
Thank you.

1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:18.166
Colonel we must be firm
with the Muslims.

1:14:18.834 --> 1:14:21.333
Punish this corporal as a warning.

1:14:22.125 --> 1:14:24.791
Rambert, tell me something.

1:14:25.334 --> 1:14:26.708
Yes, sir?

1:14:27.209 --> 1:14:30.374
Before joining De Gaulle
at the last minute,

1:14:30.500 --> 1:14:31.666
what were you in Vichy?

1:14:38.417 --> 1:14:40.124
- Martinez.
- Yes, sir.

1:14:40.584 --> 1:14:43.583
You know the Muslims.
What do we do with him?

1:14:44.209 --> 1:14:46.583
He's loyal to France, sir.

1:14:46.959 --> 1:14:48.916
All my men are patriots.

1:14:54.834 --> 1:14:56.708
You risk being court-martialled...

1:14:56.834 --> 1:14:58.916
- There's injustice, sir.
- Silence!

1:14:59.875 --> 1:15:03.541
We must strive together
towards one goal: victory.

1:15:03.917 --> 1:15:06.208
France needs us, all of us.

1:15:06.959 --> 1:15:09.708
Do you understand what l'm saying?

1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:12.083
Yes, sir.

1:15:17.292 --> 1:15:20.708
in Alsace, the 37th US Division

1:15:20.792 --> 1:15:22.208
has broken through.

1:15:22.334 --> 1:15:26.624
They're under attack and require
reinforcements and ammunition.

1:15:27.959 --> 1:15:30.333
We must hold this bridgehead

1:15:31.042 --> 1:15:33.624
until the general attack due any day.

1:15:34.209 --> 1:15:37.124
Captain Durieux needs brave men,

1:15:37.209 --> 1:15:39.166
men of experience.

1:15:39.250 --> 1:15:41.208
It's a very dangerous mission.

1:15:44.417 --> 1:15:46.458
I’ll volunteer for it, sir.

1:15:48.125 --> 1:15:51.874
Corporal,
I give you my word of honour.

1:15:52.042 --> 1:15:55.416
The rewards for yourself
and all the brave men

1:15:55.875 --> 1:15:58.083
who contribute to this exploit

1:15:58.292 --> 1:16:00.249
will be worthy of the feat.

1:16:01.167 --> 1:16:03.458
You will be the first
to reach Alsace.

1:16:03.584 --> 1:16:07.666
All of France will watch
and remember you.

1:16:08.959 --> 1:16:11.708
I shall fight with my body and soul,

1:16:12.209 --> 1:16:13.291
as I have always done.

1:16:18.292 --> 1:16:19.999
Corporal Abd-el-Kader.

1:16:20.167 --> 1:16:21.874
He's a man of his word.

1:16:22.875 --> 1:16:26.416
There's no time to lose.
Get your unit's ammunition.

1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:29.624
Sir...

1:16:31.084 --> 1:16:33.124
Private Messaoud is in jail.

1:16:34.125 --> 1:16:36.458
We need our marksman.
I’ll see to it.

1:16:36.542 --> 1:16:37.583
Thank you, sir.

1:16:55.209 --> 1:16:57.124
Tell the men to keep quiet.

1:16:57.625 --> 1:17:00.208
Quiet!
We're nearing the German lines.

1:17:00.375 --> 1:17:03.208
Keep quiet and control the mules.

1:18:18.459 --> 1:18:20.041
Larbi!

1:19:02.750 --> 1:19:03.874
Why?

1:19:04.167 --> 1:19:06.458
Why, God? Why?

1:19:07.417 --> 1:19:08.874
Why?

1:19:44.209 --> 1:19:46.624
The captain and Leroux are dead.

1:19:48.667 --> 1:19:50.499
We've lost five men too.

1:19:53.250 --> 1:19:55.624
You're the one in charge now.

1:19:59.959 --> 1:20:01.833
it’s your decision.

1:20:04.417 --> 1:20:08.124
Either you help the Americans
hold the position...

1:20:12.167 --> 1:20:13.749
or you turn back.

1:20:27.459 --> 1:20:29.958
Fetch the mule, we're carrying on!

1:20:30.042 --> 1:20:32.041
We're out of ammunition!

1:20:32.167 --> 1:20:33.874
- He's right.
- Silence!

1:20:34.792 --> 1:20:37.249
We’ll be the first French in Alsace.

1:20:37.459 --> 1:20:39.458
if we manage to hold

1:20:39.542 --> 1:20:41.999
the American positions, believe me

1:20:43.542 --> 1:20:45.708
we’ll get what we deserve.

1:20:46.042 --> 1:20:47.166
You’ll get nothing.

1:20:47.959 --> 1:20:50.124
Haven't you realized yet?

1:20:50.834 --> 1:20:53.374
I’ve given my brother for France.

1:20:54.042 --> 1:20:56.541
Enough!

1:20:59.500 --> 1:21:00.999
Corporal! Be reasonable!

1:21:02.209 --> 1:21:03.708
Be reasonable!

1:21:03.917 --> 1:21:05.583
You want to kill each other?

1:21:05.792 --> 1:21:07.791
There have been enough dead!

1:21:08.250 --> 1:21:10.166
Corporal, pull yourself together!

1:21:10.334 --> 1:21:12.208
Our comrades are dead.

1:21:13.792 --> 1:21:16.208
Thanks to God,
we’re e still alive.

1:21:18.750 --> 1:21:20.291
God bless your family.

1:21:21.667 --> 1:21:23.208
He's right.

1:21:24.750 --> 1:21:27.791
- It's no use anymore e.
- What's wrong with you?

1:21:28.750 --> 1:21:30.833
You want to be a sergeant?
Too late.

1:21:32.334 --> 1:21:34.333
You don't under stand a thing!

1:21:35.375 --> 1:21:38.374
We’re e doing our duty
by going to Alsace!

1:21:40.417 --> 1:21:43.374
Even if we pay 10 or 100 times more,

1:21:43.500 --> 1:21:45.333
we’ll pay!

1:21:47.959 --> 1:21:50.374
And they'll recognize us for it.

1:21:52.417 --> 1:21:54.249
What's wrong with you?

1:21:55.542 --> 1:21:56.583
Listen.

1:21:58.542 --> 1:22:01.333
You want to go home empty-handed?

1:22:01.959 --> 1:22:04.083
We see it through to the end.

1:22:04.417 --> 1:22:07.291
Larbi, rest his soul,
won't have died in vain.

1:22:12.459 --> 1:22:14.999
Said, please go.

1:22:16.250 --> 1:22:18.041
Bring the mule back!

1:22:18.292 --> 1:22:20.166
Don’t fight anymore.

1:22:20.584 --> 1:22:22.374
it’s over. Hurry!

1:22:49.292 --> 1:22:50.791
Come her e.

1:22:52.084 --> 1:22:53.708
Come her e, beauty!

1:23:06.042 --> 1:23:07.333
Come her e.

1:23:09.250 --> 1:23:11.874
Don't make things worse.

1:23:12.167 --> 1:23:13.666
l'm tired.

1:23:15.875 --> 1:23:17.333
Be good.

1:23:17.834 --> 1:23:19.791
I can't run after you.

1:23:20.750 --> 1:23:22.499
For the love of God!

1:25:47.959 --> 1:25:49.749
Yassir, round the back.

1:27:25.209 --> 1:27:27.124
The French!

1:27:31.709 --> 1:27:34.958
You're alone? Where are the others?

1:29:34.334 --> 1:29:37.166
We'll defend the position, sir.

1:29:39.125 --> 1:29:41.833
We'll hold it
until our troops arrive.

1:29:43.375 --> 1:29:45.374
I would have done the same...

1:29:48.334 --> 1:29:50.374
corporal.

1:29:57.667 --> 1:29:59.541
I have to go and see the men.

1:30:14.042 --> 1:30:16.083
I hope you're going to die.

1:30:21.125 --> 1:30:22.541
Sergeant...

1:30:23.750 --> 1:30:25.458
Staff sergeant.

1:32:45.792 --> 1:32:47.958
it’s as if there was no war on.

1:32:52.542 --> 1:32:54.666
What are we doing here?

1:32:59.125 --> 1:33:02.958
When the war  is over,
you'll stay in the army.

1:33:04.084 --> 1:33:07.416
You'll rise up through the ranks
to sergeant.

1:33:10.292 --> 1:33:12.416
I don't want to be a sergeant!

1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:18.208
Some have the right to it
and other s don't.

1:33:19.584 --> 1:33:21.583
God has forgotten me for now.

1:33:26.667 --> 1:33:29.416
Have you ever  given
an order to anyone?

1:33:32.167 --> 1:33:33.624
Never.

1:33:38.084 --> 1:33:39.833
Tell me frankly.

1:33:40.292 --> 1:33:42.166
Will we get through this?

1:34:10.667 --> 1:34:11.958
Listen, Said...

1:34:13.209 --> 1:34:15.708
We've always got through it...

1:34:15.875 --> 1:34:17.333
together.

1:34:17.875 --> 1:34:19.666
Have you forgotten?

1:34:21.167 --> 1:34:23.333
Everything's in God's hands.

1:34:42.417 --> 1:34:43.624
Thank you, ma'am.

1:34:51.875 --> 1:34:53.708
Enjoy your  meal.

1:34:53.834 --> 1:34:55.458
Thank you, ma'am.

1:34:58.917 --> 1:35:00.833
Who can live in this cold?

1:35:03.292 --> 1:35:04.333
The French.

1:35:56.750 --> 1:35:58.041
Can I fetch milk?

1:36:20.709 --> 1:36:22.874
Does she give a lot of milk?

1:36:25.334 --> 1:36:27.416
Two or three buckets.

1:36:33.709 --> 1:36:34.958
Want to try?

1:36:35.750 --> 1:36:36.833
Yes.

1:37:07.042 --> 1:37:08.458
You're never afraid?

1:37:11.459 --> 1:37:13.249
Sometimes I am...

1:37:15.459 --> 1:37:17.458
but l'm not afraid tonight.

1:44:27.875 --> 1:44:30.249
I don't want to die here.

1:44:36.334 --> 1:44:38.291
Lord...

1:44:38.459 --> 1:44:41.124
I declare there is no deity but God.

1:45:50.209 --> 1:45:53.416
- I’ll fetch Martinez.
- Wait, Said.

1:45:54.125 --> 1:45:56.124
Listen to me...

1:45:56.750 --> 1:45:58.416
Messaoud is dead.

1:46:00.834 --> 1:46:02.749
Be careful, my brother.

1:46:03.500 --> 1:46:04.874
Wait.

1:46:06.625 --> 1:46:07.666
Yassir!

1:46:08.584 --> 1:46:10.041
Cover us!

1:46:13.042 --> 1:46:14.708
One, two...

1:46:14.792 --> 1:46:15.999
Go!

1:46:34.959 --> 1:46:37.249
Sarge, get up!

1:46:47.209 --> 1:46:48.374
Get up, sarge.

1:46:53.625 --> 1:46:55.041
Come on!

1:47:31.959 --> 1:47:33.083
Yassir!

1:47:33.792 --> 1:47:35.791
Cover me! Her e I come!

1:47:51.334 --> 1:47:53.208
Get out! Hurry!

1:47:59.584 --> 1:48:01.208
Come on let's go!

1:48:01.875 --> 1:48:03.208
Move it!

1:48:27.792 --> 1:48:30.083
Get up! Get up, Yassir!

1:48:32.709 --> 1:48:35.166
Get up, for pity's sake!

1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:37.041
My brother's...

1:49:37.834 --> 1:49:39.291
I'm with you!

1:49:39.375 --> 1:49:40.749
Don't shoot!

1:49:40.834 --> 1:49:41.874
Okay.

1:51:55.875 --> 1:51:58.708
Don't stop! Keep going!
Move it!

1:52:01.959 --> 1:52:03.374
Colonel...

1:52:04.750 --> 1:52:05.874
Colonel!

1:52:07.709 --> 1:52:09.624
- Stop!
- Let me see the colonel.

1:52:09.709 --> 1:52:11.583
- What?
- Let me see him.

1:52:11.667 --> 1:52:14.624
- See your sergeant.
- He's dead. Captain too.

1:52:14.709 --> 1:52:16.583
So where's your unit?

1:52:17.625 --> 1:52:20.249
I don't have one. They're all dead.

1:52:21.625 --> 1:52:22.666
Sergeant!

1:52:23.834 --> 1:52:25.874
You needed a corporal? Here's one.

1:52:25.959 --> 1:52:28.499
Get your  pack and follow us.

1:52:50.625 --> 1:52:51.999
Look over her e!

1:52:54.792 --> 1:52:56.958
The French forces free Alsace!

1:53:00.584 --> 1:53:01.916
This way!

1:53:02.250 --> 1:53:03.749
Smile!

1:53:36.375 --> 1:53:39.999
60 year s later

1:58:09.459 --> 1:58:14.041
in 1959m a law was passed to freeze
the pensions of infantrymen

1:58:14.292 --> 1:58:18.291
from former French colonies
about to become independent.

1:58:18.542 --> 1:58:20.916
In 2002, after endless hearings,

1:58:21.209 --> 1:58:23.874
the French government was ordered

1:58:24.209 --> 1:58:26.416
to pay the pensions in full.

1:58:26.875 --> 1:58:29.583
But successive governments

1:58:29.834 --> 1:58:32.333
have pushed back this payment.
