00:03.462 --> 00:06.044
(birds chirping)

00:33.075 --> 00:34.485
Hey!

00:34.660 --> 00:37.242
Hey! Slow down!
Slow down!

00:37.413 --> 00:39.620
Slow--
I'm begging you!

00:41.459 --> 00:44.201
Please!

01:03.022 --> 01:06.014
(walker snarling )

01:23.209 --> 01:26.201
(walker snarling )

01:31.092 --> 01:32.923
(tires spinning)

01:44.563 --> 01:46.895
(snarling )

01:52.738 --> 01:55.354
(walkers snarling )

02:01.789 --> 02:03.745
Cover your ears.

02:12.925 --> 02:15.257
( gunshot echoes)

02:15.428 --> 02:19.262
Yeah, this'll work.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.470
Tell me when.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.730
( car door opens, closes )

02:33.904 --> 02:35.280
Hey.

02:39.952 --> 02:41.943
Put something
under the car like this

02:42.121 --> 02:44.282
with a little gravel
and sticks.

02:44.457 --> 02:46.994
It gives you traction.

02:47.168 --> 02:50.956
Wouldn't have to do it
if she didn't get us stuck.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.212
It was an honest mistake.

02:58.304 --> 02:59.635
Why'd you let her come?

02:59.805 --> 03:01.215
She took you to Woodbury

03:01.390 --> 03:03.005
and you said she
just split on you.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.971
- And Oscar died and you guys--
- It wasn't that simple.

03:06.145 --> 03:07.931
| asked her to come today.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.312
I didn't want to leave her
at the prison if I wasn't there,

03:10.483 --> 03:12.189
not with Merle.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.898
That and we got
common interests.

03:18.449 --> 03:21.282
For right now,
we have the same problems.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.693
So maybe we can work
on them together.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.702
Carl:
Just for right now?

03:25.873 --> 03:28.956
Rick:
Yeah, just for right now.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.287
Man:
Hey!

03:31.462 --> 03:33.373
Help me!

03:33.547 --> 03:36.289
I'm begging you!
Don't leave!

03:36.467 --> 03:39.004
Please!

03:39.178 --> 03:41.885
- Hey!
- ( taps car)

03:42.056 --> 03:44.968
- ( engine starts)
- Don't leave!

03:45.142 --> 03:47.178
Please!

03:47.353 --> 03:49.514
Let's go.

03:49.688 --> 03:52.020
Man:
I'm okay!

03:52.191 --> 03:54.557
Please!

03:54.735 --> 03:57.021
Please!

03:59.573 --> 04:01.859
Help me!

04:02.034 --> 04:04.366
Stop!

04:06.497 --> 04:08.488
(theme music playing )

05:19.320 --> 05:21.936
(sighs)

05:28.662 --> 05:30.698
Damn it!

05:43.802 --> 05:45.758
You got any other
police stations in town?

05:45.930 --> 05:48.967
l was the police here.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.927
Me and a few other guys.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.592
Ain't a big town.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.479
There's other
places to check.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.240
May not have as many guns
as were in here, but--

06:05.407 --> 06:07.568
We need as many guns
as were in here.

06:07.743 --> 06:10.155
- Ammo, too.
- Yeah, we do.

06:10.329 --> 06:13.321
But right now,
| only got a line on a couple.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.786
There's a few places
out on the main street--

06:16.961 --> 06:18.826
bars, a liquor store.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.835
Owners had a gun or two
behind the counter

06:21.006 --> 06:22.337
that people
didn't know about.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.339
I did.
I signed the permits.

06:24.510 --> 06:26.671
They might still be there.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.093
Do you have a problem
with that approach?

06:35.980 --> 06:38.266
No, Rick.
I don't have a problem.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.577
( rope creaking )

07:55.184 --> 07:58.096
- What is it?
- I don't know.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.148
( rats squeaking )

08:42.314 --> 08:45.806
It looks like someone's
already made this theirs.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.475
Doesn't mean they found
what we're looking for.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.320
Couple of the places
are just up ahead.

08:52.491 --> 08:54.527
Let's get in

08:54.702 --> 08:56.693
and get the hell
out of here.

09:04.420 --> 09:06.661
There.

09:06.839 --> 09:08.500
Tyrell's.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.630
A shotgun
and two handguns.

09:10.801 --> 09:14.259
License issued
to Tyrell Debbs.

09:14.430 --> 09:16.341
(snarling )

09:22.646 --> 09:24.147
Rick:
Wait.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.895
She'll get caught.

09:29.862 --> 09:31.648
(gunshot)

09:31.822 --> 09:34.154
Hands!

09:34.324 --> 09:37.816
Now you drop
what you got and you go.

09:37.995 --> 09:41.158
Your guns, your shoes,
and that sword.

09:41.331 --> 09:44.243
All of it.
10 seconds.

09:44.418 --> 09:45.874
- Run for the car now.
- 10...

09:46.044 --> 09:47.659
- Dad.
- We need that rifle.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.454
...nine,

09:50.632 --> 09:52.042
eight...

09:52.217 --> 09:55.300
- I think I can get up there.
- ...seven,

09:55.471 --> 09:57.632
- six...
- Carl, go.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.842
(gunfire)

10:30.172 --> 10:32.003
(gunfire)

10:46.605 --> 10:48.846
- ( gunshot)
- ( groans)

11:02.538 --> 11:04.779
You okay?

11:04.957 --> 11:06.663
Yeah.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.247
I told you to run
for the car.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.958
I didn't want you
to have to do that.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.633
I had to.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.385
(clunking)

11:24.560 --> 11:26.266
He's wearing
body armor.

11:30.858 --> 11:34.316
- He's alive.
- Do we care?

11:56.508 --> 11:59.045
Keep an eye out
for booby traps.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.801
Looks like he's gotten
pretty creative so far.

12:01.972 --> 12:05.009
I thought we were just gonna get in
and get the hell out of here.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.174
I'm not leaving him
on the street.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.343
Look, I know you said
he helped you--

12:09.521 --> 12:12.058
He saved my life.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.854
He wasn't like this then.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.649
Michonne:
Okay.

12:23.702 --> 12:26.694
Jesus, he has a son.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.534
You think he's in there?

12:32.794 --> 12:35.285
( rats squeaking )

12:48.143 --> 12:49.883
Don't.

12:50.062 --> 12:51.893
You said booby traps.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.571
Thank you.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.578
Let's just get him
inside and go.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.330
( Rick and Michonne grunting )

13:19.132 --> 13:20.997
Whoa!

13:41.279 --> 13:43.531
Carl, watch the wire.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.877
I showed him that
weapons locker last year.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.834
And it had
all of this in it?

14:02.009 --> 14:03.795
No, not even half.

14:03.969 --> 14:07.086
He's been busy.
The cot.

15:50.242 --> 15:51.573
No.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.535
We're gonna wait
for him to wake up.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.081
Make sure he's okay.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.739
He tried to kill us.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.953
He told us to go.
He didn't know who we were.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.119
He tried to kill us and we didn't
leave him for the walkers.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.673
He's had a good day.
He doesn't need half of these guns.

16:05.841 --> 16:07.377
We do.

16:07.551 --> 16:10.167
We're waiting for him to wake up.
That's it.

16:10.345 --> 16:12.586
Have you taken a look
around this place?

16:12.764 --> 16:15.801
The axe, the spikes,
the walls.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.512
- You think he's crazy?
- No.

16:17.686 --> 16:20.052
I think he's dangerous.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.596
I know him.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.265
He wasn't
like this then.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.903
We're gonna wait
for him to wake up.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.790
( restraints zip )

17:20.665 --> 17:22.246
What do you see?

17:22.417 --> 17:25.329
Carl:
It's our neighborhood.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.593
It's gone.

17:35.764 --> 17:38.847
Is that why
you wanted to come?

17:39.017 --> 17:41.303
To see the house?

17:42.938 --> 17:44.929
Carl.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.308
ljust wanted to come.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.696
(crunching)

17:54.866 --> 17:57.528
We're eating his food now?

17:58.870 --> 18:01.202
The mat said "Welcome."

18:13.260 --> 18:15.171
I'm going on a run.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.136
Where?

18:18.306 --> 18:22.140
I thought maybe the one thing
people didn't loot was cribs

18:22.310 --> 18:24.801
and there's that baby place
that Mom's friend Sara ran.

18:24.980 --> 18:26.766
- It's just around the corner.
- Carl.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.771
Dad, it's just around
the corner.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.603
And there's all
those walker traps.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.392
You're gonna need some help
carrying the box.

18:32.570 --> 18:33.980
What?

18:34.155 --> 18:36.407
If you're gonna get a crib,
you have to get the box.

18:36.574 --> 18:39.281
It's big and heavy.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.444
You're gonna need help
carrying the box.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.455
You are getting
a crib, right?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.331
That's what I said.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.788
Then I'll go with him.

18:53.216 --> 18:56.003
Right there,
that's the deal.

18:59.431 --> 19:01.638
You get into trouble,
you holler, okay?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.595
- l'll hear it from here.
- Okay.

19:17.324 --> 19:20.737
(walkers snarling )

19:26.624 --> 19:28.831
You don't have
to come with me.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.833
I can handle it.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.995
I told your dad
l'd help you.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.418
Yeah, okay.

19:38.136 --> 19:41.094
(squeaking )

19:41.264 --> 19:43.175
(walker snarling )

19:47.145 --> 19:49.136
Guess we should
take care of that.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.305
Mmm.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.376
Shit.

20:21.638 --> 20:24.721
What the hell was that?

20:24.891 --> 20:27.598
I want to do this
on my own.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.182
You just passed
the baby place.

20:38.196 --> 20:41.359
I'm getting Judith
something else first, okay?

21:23.575 --> 21:25.907
I'm sorry
this happened to you.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.268
(casing clinks)

22:04.199 --> 22:06.941
(shouts)

22:07.118 --> 22:10.451
Do you know who lam?
Do you see who I am?

22:10.622 --> 22:12.112
People wearing
dead people's faces.

22:12.290 --> 22:13.655
- Morgan, listen to me.
- No, I don't know you!

22:13.833 --> 22:16.791
- You do know me.
- I don't know you!

22:16.961 --> 22:19.293
- ( groans )
- You saved my life, Morgan.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.125
You know me.

22:21.299 --> 22:23.381
Look at me.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.462
( groans )

22:25.637 --> 22:28.253
You don't clear, man.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.296
You turn.

22:30.475 --> 22:32.557
You just die.

22:32.727 --> 22:35.309
- You know me.
- I don't know anyone anymore!

22:35.480 --> 22:38.813
You don't clear!

22:38.983 --> 22:41.395
( screams )

22:41.569 --> 22:43.070
( groans )

22:43.238 --> 22:45.570
You know me.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.982
You crazy
son of a bitch.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.991
Please.

22:53.498 --> 22:55.329
Please kill me.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.504
(snarling )

23:15.520 --> 23:18.512
( rat squeaking )

23:22.860 --> 23:25.021
Just kill me.

23:25.196 --> 23:28.609
Just kill me.

23:28.783 --> 23:30.523
Just kill me.
Just--

23:30.702 --> 23:33.193
just kill me.

23:33.371 --> 23:37.489
You found me last year
in my front yard, Morgan.

23:37.667 --> 23:41.205
You and--
you found me.

23:41.379 --> 23:44.792
You fed me. You told me
what's happening.

23:44.966 --> 23:47.173
You saved me.

23:47.343 --> 23:50.130
My name is Rick Grimes.
You know me.

23:50.305 --> 23:52.796
I'm not wearing
a dead man's face.

23:55.727 --> 23:57.263
I gave you this.

23:57.437 --> 24:00.395
I said I'd turn it on
every day at dawn

24:00.565 --> 24:02.851
so you could find me.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.020
Rick?

24:10.575 --> 24:12.987
I know you.

24:13.161 --> 24:16.574
Oh, man.
Damn it, |--

24:16.748 --> 24:19.285
I know you.
I know who you are.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.125
You said you'd turn
yours on at dawn.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.832
That's what you said.

24:25.006 --> 24:28.339
I mean, I hadn't
worked up to it yet, and--

24:29.719 --> 24:31.209
then I did.

24:33.056 --> 24:36.594
On the roof
every morning for days.

24:36.768 --> 24:39.054
For weeks,
me and my boy.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.809
And then...

24:43.316 --> 24:45.102
me.

24:46.486 --> 24:49.102
Just static, though.
Nothing but static.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.362
And then nothing
but nothing.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.115
You weren't there.
You were never there.

24:55.286 --> 24:56.822
- l was.
- No, not when I tried.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.157
I mean, you said you would
turn on your radio

24:59.332 --> 25:00.663
- every day at dawn.
- Morgan, |--

25:00.833 --> 25:02.744
You said that you would
turn on your radio...

25:02.919 --> 25:04.284
- I did.
- ...every day at dawn

25:04.462 --> 25:07.169
and you were not there!

25:11.678 --> 25:15.546
I kept getting--
I kept getting pushed farther out.

25:18.726 --> 25:21.843
I had to.
I didn't have a choice.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.808
I found my wife
and my boy.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.893
I had people.

25:28.361 --> 25:29.897
I had to keep them safe.

25:31.739 --> 25:34.401
We kept getting pushed back
deeper into the country.

25:34.575 --> 25:38.614
I swear to God
I didn't have a choice.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.574
You can have
your radio back

25:40.748 --> 25:43.865
'cause it looks like
I finally found you.

25:44.043 --> 25:47.627
You found your wife
and your son.

25:47.797 --> 25:50.083
That's what happened, right?
You found them.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.011
And did they--

25:58.182 --> 26:00.434
did she--
did your wife--

26:00.601 --> 26:02.512
did she turn?

26:04.439 --> 26:07.101
No, she died.

26:08.860 --> 26:11.852
So you didn't have
to see that, then.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.940
Of course not.

26:14.115 --> 26:16.697
( chuckles )
Not like me.

26:16.868 --> 26:19.325
( laughs )
No.

26:19.495 --> 26:23.033
Not like me.
Not like my wife.

26:23.207 --> 26:25.072
You remember
what happened to her?

26:27.295 --> 26:29.581
You remember
what she was?

26:30.923 --> 26:32.709
Yeah.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.886
Oh.

26:42.143 --> 26:43.929
You gave me the gun.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.389
You tried.

26:46.564 --> 26:48.555
What did I try, Morgan?

26:48.733 --> 26:50.894
- ( laughs )
- What did I try?

26:51.068 --> 26:53.935
You tried to get me to do it
'cause I was supposed to do it.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.729
l was supposed
to kill her, my Jenny.

26:56.908 --> 27:00.241
Knew I was supposed to,
but I let it go.

27:01.621 --> 27:04.328
Let it go like there wasn't
gonna be a reckoning.

27:08.336 --> 27:09.917
We was always
looking for food.

27:10.087 --> 27:12.339
You know, it always
came down to food.

27:12.507 --> 27:14.498
And l was--

27:14.675 --> 27:16.836
l was checking out a cellar

27:17.011 --> 27:19.468
and I didn't want Duane
to come down there with me.

27:19.639 --> 27:22.005
And then when I came up...

27:24.018 --> 27:27.260
she was standing there
right in front of him

27:27.438 --> 27:30.350
and he had his gun up

27:30.525 --> 27:33.107
and he couldn't do it.

27:34.779 --> 27:36.644
So I called to him

27:36.823 --> 27:38.609
and he turned.

27:38.783 --> 27:40.614
And then she was just--

27:40.785 --> 27:43.322
just on him.

27:43.496 --> 27:46.454
And | see red.
I see red.

27:46.624 --> 27:49.957
Everything is red.
Everything I see is red.

27:50.127 --> 27:51.913
And I do it.

27:54.507 --> 27:56.338
Finally.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.842
Finally was too late.

28:03.975 --> 28:05.636
l was supposed to.

28:07.478 --> 28:09.264
l was selfish.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.144
l was weak.

28:16.571 --> 28:19.313
You gave me the gun.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.613
Hey, your boy--

28:25.788 --> 28:27.494
is he dead?

28:30.501 --> 28:32.492
- No.
-No?

28:32.670 --> 28:34.331
He will be.

28:34.505 --> 28:36.291
See, 'cause people
like you,

28:36.465 --> 28:39.127
the good people,
they always die.

28:39.302 --> 28:42.009
And the bad people do, too.

28:42.179 --> 28:45.046
But the weak people,

28:45.224 --> 28:47.510
the people like me...

28:49.061 --> 28:52.269
we have inherited
the earth.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.813
You think l was gonna
let you go in there?

29:45.910 --> 29:47.446
ljust think it's none
of your business.

29:47.620 --> 29:49.281
You don't know me.
You don't know my dad.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.070
I came out here to help.

29:51.248 --> 29:53.500
You came out here
for common interests.

29:53.668 --> 29:55.579
We have the same enemy
and the same problem.

29:55.753 --> 29:57.493
And that's why you're here.
That's it.

29:57.672 --> 29:59.754
This is important.

29:59.924 --> 30:03.087
I'm going to do this.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.761
And I know how I can.

30:04.929 --> 30:07.511
You can't stop me.

30:11.102 --> 30:13.058
Psst

30:15.272 --> 30:17.183
I can't stop you.

30:18.943 --> 30:21.935
But you can't stop me
from helping you.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.279
(belljingles)

30:26.450 --> 30:29.112
(squeaking )

30:31.163 --> 30:33.700
(growling)

31:22.423 --> 31:25.039
( growls )

32:05.883 --> 32:09.091
( rat squeaking )

32:13.057 --> 32:15.594
- ( snarling )
- In the kitchen.

32:18.395 --> 32:19.726
(gunshot)

32:29.073 --> 32:31.564
( gunshots)

32:34.578 --> 32:36.489
No!

32:40.126 --> 32:41.787
- I've got to go back in.
- Where is it?

32:41.961 --> 32:44.748
We have to go back.
We have to. l have to.

32:44.922 --> 32:46.753
It's the only one left!

32:46.924 --> 32:50.212
(walkers pounding)

32:50.386 --> 32:53.093
- Fine.
- Not like this.

32:54.974 --> 32:58.091
I don't know you.
| get that.

32:58.269 --> 33:00.760
But can you do
something for me?

33:00.938 --> 33:02.678
Wait here.

33:02.857 --> 33:05.394
- I can help.
- No. And no more bullshit.

33:05.568 --> 33:07.229
You wait here.

33:07.403 --> 33:09.564
That's how we get it done.

33:37.725 --> 33:39.386
Hey.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.861
| just--

33:53.032 --> 33:55.489
ljust thought
Judith should--

33:55.659 --> 33:57.650
should know what
her mom looked like.

33:59.038 --> 34:00.869
Thank you.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.157
l was gonna go
back in anyway.

34:05.753 --> 34:08.165
ljust couldn't
leave this behind.

34:08.339 --> 34:10.580
It's just
too damn gorgeous.

34:15.596 --> 34:17.382
I'm not going
to kill you.

34:20.184 --> 34:23.142
I don't think that's
what's supposed to happen.

34:23.312 --> 34:26.019
I think you're supposed
to come back with us.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.351
( laughs)

34:28.525 --> 34:30.686
After all that?

34:30.861 --> 34:32.397
After me trying to blow
your head off,

34:32.571 --> 34:35.108
stab your heart out,
happily ever after together?

34:35.282 --> 34:36.738
You couldn't kill me,
I couldn't kill you.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.365
I'll take that as a sign.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.070
Huh.

34:43.707 --> 34:45.959
We found a prison.

34:46.126 --> 34:48.538
The fences
can keep 'em out.

34:51.298 --> 34:53.289
Is that where your wife died?

34:57.513 --> 34:59.128
Just go.

34:59.306 --> 35:00.807
Don't go back.
Don't stop.

35:00.975 --> 35:03.432
Just get yourself
some more time.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.218
Look, I can help you.

35:06.397 --> 35:08.388
You can come back with us.
You can heal.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.146
You're taking a lot
of guns, Rick.

35:10.317 --> 35:14.356
No, I'm just saying that
that all is a lot of guns.

35:14.530 --> 35:17.192
Why do you need
the guns, Rick?

35:17.366 --> 35:19.152
'Cause if you got
something good,

35:19.326 --> 35:21.533
that just means that there's
someone who wants to take it.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.990
And that is what
is happening, right?

35:24.164 --> 35:25.825
- We're gonna win.
- ( chuckles)

35:26.000 --> 35:28.537
You can be there.
You can help.

35:28.711 --> 35:31.919
You will be torn apart
by teeth or bullets.

35:32.089 --> 35:34.205
You and your boy.

35:34.383 --> 35:36.874
Your people, but not me.

35:37.052 --> 35:39.885
Because I am not gonna
watch that happen again.

35:44.768 --> 35:46.349
Man, you take the guns.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.932
You know there's a chance.
That's what you can't square.

35:49.106 --> 35:50.437
That's what hurts.

35:50.607 --> 35:52.734
You know there's a chance.

35:52.901 --> 35:55.187
I don't think you heard
a damn word that I said.

36:01.618 --> 36:04.951
We both started out
in the same place.

36:05.122 --> 36:08.535
Things went bad for you,
things went bad for me.

36:08.709 --> 36:12.327
But you're not
seeing things right.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.460
I don't blame you,
what you've lost,

36:14.631 --> 36:16.087
what you've been through.

36:16.258 --> 36:17.623
You're not
seeing things right,

36:17.801 --> 36:20.213
but you can come back from this,
I know you can.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.966
You have to.

36:24.141 --> 36:26.132
This can't be it.

36:26.310 --> 36:29.097
It can't be.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.478
You got to be able
to come back from this.

36:34.401 --> 36:36.141
- No.
- Morgan, please.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.981
No!

36:39.239 --> 36:40.820
l have to clear.

36:40.991 --> 36:42.902
That's why
I didn't die today.

36:43.077 --> 36:44.408
That's the sign.

36:44.578 --> 36:47.115
l have to, man.
l have to.

36:50.334 --> 36:52.620
l have to clear.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.268
(growling)

37:29.039 --> 37:30.449
Hey.

37:30.624 --> 37:32.535
l was just about
to look for you.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.870
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

37:35.045 --> 37:36.956
You're here now.

37:40.384 --> 37:43.046
Oh, it's nothing.

37:47.099 --> 37:49.055
Thank you.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.904
He's okay?

38:14.668 --> 38:16.954
Wait. Hey.

38:17.129 --> 38:19.495
- Carl.
- Morgan.

38:22.468 --> 38:24.504
I had to shoot you.

38:24.678 --> 38:26.669
You know I had to, right?

38:28.932 --> 38:30.763
I'm sorry.

38:32.853 --> 38:35.265
Hey, son.

38:36.607 --> 38:38.848
Don't ever be sorry.

39:06.637 --> 39:08.628
Everything okay with her?

39:10.140 --> 39:12.096
lthink she might
be one of us.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.974
What?

39:17.981 --> 39:20.063
Everything went okay.

39:20.234 --> 39:22.475
( chuckles )

39:22.653 --> 39:25.645
Hop in. I'll throw this
in the back.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.671
You see something?

39:55.185 --> 39:57.597
I know you see things.

39:57.771 --> 39:59.352
People.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.279
