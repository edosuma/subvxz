-(siren wails)

00:37.037 --> 00:38.455
Sorry. Sorry.

00:38.538 --> 00:39.914
Boy, it's getting
harder and harder

00:39.998 --> 00:40.999
to make it here by 10:00.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.208
(coughing)

00:44.085 --> 00:45.795
We'll start the tour
in a second.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.922
I've just got to check
the answering machine.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.215

00:49.299 --> 00:51.176
Oh, can't anybody in this town

00:51.259 --> 00:52.802
take the law into
their own hands?

00:52.886 --> 00:53.803
(beep)

00:56.306 --> 00:58.016
Gather around, kids.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.726

01:04.647 --> 01:06.900
Now, what I am
about to show you next

01:06.983 --> 01:08.860
may shock and educate you.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.445
Hold on to your values

01:10.528 --> 01:12.530
as we step through
the looking glass

01:12.614 --> 01:14.949
into a hippie pot party.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.243
While Johnny Welfare plays

01:17.327 --> 01:19.579
acid rock on a stolen guitar,

01:19.662 --> 01:22.207
his old lady has a better idea.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.007

01:50.276 --> 01:53.196
Okay, that was the sand movie.

01:53.279 --> 01:56.825
Now, it'll just take me a second
to set up our next movie.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.494
Oh, Miss Hoover,
movies are a nice break,

01:59.577 --> 02:02.455
but couldn't we be doing
something a little more
challenging?

02:02.539 --> 02:04.499
Probably.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.216
<i>NARRATOR:</i>
<i>The moon--</i>

02:13.299 --> 02:15.927
<i>for several years,</i>
<i>she has fascinated many.</i>

02:16.010 --> 02:19.764

03:00.096 --> 03:02.765
Miss Hoover, the movie's over.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.893
Where's Miss Hoover?

03:04.976 --> 03:06.561
Hey, her car's gone.

03:06.644 --> 03:09.147
Maybe she drove to the moon.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.484
It's not my nature to complain,
but so far today,

03:13.568 --> 03:15.570
we've had three movies,
two filmstrips,

03:15.653 --> 03:18.031
and an hour and a half
of magazine time.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.783
I just don't feel challenged.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.161
Of course, we can make things
more challenging, Lisa,

03:23.244 --> 03:25.496
but then the stupider students
would be in here complaining,

03:25.580 --> 03:27.749
furrowing their brows
in a vain attempt

03:27.832 --> 03:29.709
to understand the situation.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.169
(groans)

03:31.252 --> 03:33.213
We're now in
the Communications Room

03:33.296 --> 03:35.256
or the Com Room.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.383
Uh, this is a police radio--

03:37.467 --> 03:41.804
the single most important piece
of equipment in the Com Room.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.390
As you can see,
some of the boys like to put

03:44.474 --> 03:46.100
their banana stickers
all over it.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.353
There's Chiquita.
There's Del Monte.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.104
There's a Banana Co.,

03:50.188 --> 03:51.773
Gorilla's Choice.

03:51.856 --> 03:54.651
Now, everyone follow me
to my chair,

03:54.734 --> 03:58.321
where I just need to get
off my feet for a few minutes.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.865
Ahh!

04:00.949 --> 04:03.159
Ah... I won't be
getting up soon.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.371
Testing.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.291
(louder)
Testing.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.003
Hmm.

04:14.087 --> 04:14.963
Hmm.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.049
Hmm.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.884
Hey.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.267
(devilish laughter)

04:27.350 --> 04:29.018
(buzzing)

04:34.274 --> 04:36.609
Testing!

04:36.693 --> 04:40.238
(voice echoing)
Testing, testing, testing...

04:40.321 --> 04:44.367
-(parrots screeching)
-PARROTS: Testing, testing...

04:46.577 --> 04:47.495
(echoing continues)

04:54.168 --> 04:55.336
(screams)

04:55.420 --> 04:57.171
(loud ringing)

04:57.255 --> 04:59.507
You've really done it this
time, Bart!

04:59.590 --> 05:02.302
You're in for the punishment
of a lifetime!

05:02.385 --> 05:05.346
When do you expect
the ringing will stop?

05:05.430 --> 05:08.224
In about ten to 15 seconds.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.018
I certainly hope so!

05:10.101 --> 05:12.478
-(ringing stops)
-Ooh! That's better.

05:12.562 --> 05:13.896
(pops)

05:13.980 --> 05:16.316
Now, about your punishment,
young man.

05:16.399 --> 05:19.152
I know. I'll go to my room
and think about what I did.

05:19.235 --> 05:22.322
Oh, no. Your room
is full of toys.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.157
You're going
to the, uh, garage.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.367
You're the boss.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.328
I tell you, Chief,

05:28.411 --> 05:29.996
I just don't know what
we're going to do with him.

05:30.079 --> 05:33.291
You know,
you do have options.

05:33.374 --> 05:36.085
For example, there are
behavior-modifying drugs.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.880
How wedded are you
to the Bart you know?

05:38.963 --> 05:42.550
-Not very.
-No. No drugs.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.886
Bart just needs
a little discipline.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.637
Hey, what about military school?

05:46.721 --> 05:48.222
It set my brother straight.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.850
Now he owns and operates
a famous cave.

05:50.933 --> 05:54.020
Hmm. You know,
maybe Chief Wiggum is right.

05:54.103 --> 05:59.650
Military school is a good idea.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.362
-(motor whirring)
-(siren yelps)

06:11.871 --> 06:16.000
Wow! I can't believe
we're going to Disneyland.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.668
Hey, where's all your luggage?

06:19.420 --> 06:21.547
-Hurray!
-Oh, yeah!

06:21.631 --> 06:24.384
You dream about this day
for so long.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.594
Then when it comes,
you don't know
what to say.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.221
Shh, shh, shh.

06:28.304 --> 06:31.891
Edna, your tears say
more than words ever could.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.268
(choking)
Military school?

06:34.352 --> 06:35.895
You lied to me.

06:35.978 --> 06:39.399
Well, I'm sorry
if you heard Disneyland,

06:39.482 --> 06:41.984
but I distinctly said
military school.

06:50.451 --> 06:51.869
And that's how
we'll mold your boy

06:51.953 --> 06:54.038
into a productive
member of society--

06:54.122 --> 06:55.331
through an intensive program

06:55.415 --> 06:57.708
of push-ups
and formation marching.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.669
Well, it certainly
was nice of you

06:59.752 --> 07:02.255
to accept Bart
in the middle
of the semester.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.298
Fortunately, we've had
a couple of recent freak-outs.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.759
So that freed up
a couple of bunks.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.554
-Freak-outs?
-If that happens,

07:09.637 --> 07:11.472
are we still charged
for the entire semester?

07:11.556 --> 07:13.599
Our high standards
challenge students

07:13.683 --> 07:15.435
to reach their full potential.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.562
Look at how disciplined
they are.

07:17.645 --> 07:20.022
They're just like
the terra-cotta
warriors of Xian.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.525
They sure are.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.860
Ow!

07:23.943 --> 07:26.404
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

07:26.487 --> 07:28.030
That's not
so disciplined.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.407
They're just children,
Mr. Simpson.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.325
Pww! I guess.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.619
Truth is beauty,
beauty truth, sir!

07:33.703 --> 07:35.872
(gasps)
They're discussing poetry.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.249
Oh! We never do that
at my school.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.668
But the truth can be
harsh and disturbing.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.753
How can that be
considered beautiful?

07:42.837 --> 07:45.715
Oh, they sure sucked
the fun out of that poem.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.175
Please don't make me stay, Dad.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.676
I'll do anything you say.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.052
I'll find religion;
I'll be good, sometimes.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.138
-Let go of my leg.
-No!

07:52.221 --> 07:55.391
Son, for the last time
you're staying
at military school.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.434
And so am I.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.936
(gasps)

07:59.020 --> 08:01.689
This school has everything
I ever wanted.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.608
Lisa, no!

08:03.691 --> 08:05.568
This place is just
a jail for children.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.320
No jail can hold me.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.459
All right, let's go
over this one more time,

08:21.542 --> 08:23.669
just to make sure
I understand the situation.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.630
(clearing throat)

08:25.713 --> 08:27.673
You're a girl?

08:27.757 --> 08:29.884
-Yes.
-Oh, gosh darn it.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.802
I just don't understand
the situation.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.763
(clearing throat)

08:33.846 --> 08:35.306
You're a girl.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.892
All I want is a chance
to prove myself.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.727
Hmm.

08:39.810 --> 08:44.190
In our 185 years, we have
never had a female cadet.

08:44.273 --> 08:45.691
Oh, but that seems
to be the way

08:45.775 --> 08:47.735
the wind is blowing
these days.

08:47.818 --> 08:51.614
After all,
we have female singers...

08:51.697 --> 08:54.075
female motorists.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.368
Hmm.

08:55.451 --> 08:58.079
Welcome aboard.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.581
Lisa, if you ever want
to quit and come home,

09:00.665 --> 09:02.875
I'll be here in half a jif.

09:02.959 --> 09:03.960
I want to quit and come home.

09:05.503 --> 09:06.879
I want to quit and come home.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.840
Oh, honey,
I heard you the first time.

09:09.924 --> 09:10.883
(kisses)

09:20.393 --> 09:23.271
Atten-hut!

09:23.354 --> 09:26.440
Gentlemen, we now have
a girl cadet among our ranks,

09:26.524 --> 09:29.193
so we're going to have
to make a few changes.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.861
First of all, Franklin,

09:30.945 --> 09:32.488
you are no longer
the girliest cadet here.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.949
Well, we'll see about that.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.285
Second, this is now
the girls' barracks.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.787
So pack your things.
You're moving in
with company "L."

09:39.870 --> 09:42.123
Company "L"?
But they smell.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.416
Yes, we've all
heard the chant.

09:43.499 --> 09:44.959
Now, fall out!

09:45.042 --> 09:46.419
Sorry. Sorry.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.838
I know we'll be friends.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.048
Talk about getting off
on the wrong foot.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.341
(nervous chuckle)

09:53.884 --> 09:55.970
I can't believe
they let a girl in.

09:56.053 --> 09:59.098
Don't worry. We'll drive her
out of the academy.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.809
That is why God created hazing.

10:01.892 --> 10:04.145
(thunder rumbling)

10:04.228 --> 10:05.980
(grunting)

10:11.819 --> 10:13.446
What's the matter?

10:13.529 --> 10:15.531
Don't girls like doing
push-ups in the mud?

10:15.615 --> 10:16.991
Is there any answer
I can give

10:17.074 --> 10:19.577
that won't result
in more push-ups?

10:19.660 --> 10:22.204
(all whispering)

10:22.288 --> 10:23.539
No.

10:26.083 --> 10:29.337
Hey, look,
it's the school motto.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.880
"I'll die before
I surrender, Tim."

10:30.963 --> 10:32.548
Who's Tim?

10:32.632 --> 10:35.718
Apparently, Tim was somebody
who was with the general

10:35.801 --> 10:37.762
moments before he was shot
in the head.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.221
Cleaning graffiti
off a statue

10:39.305 --> 10:42.141
makes a mockery
of everything I stand for.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.684
I don't think I can
survive here, Lise.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.353
That's how they want you
to feel.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.812
But if you just hang
in there,

10:46.896 --> 10:48.230
they'll eventually
accept you.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.982
Get to work!

10:50.066 --> 10:52.693
I want to see my face
in that horse's ass.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.782
Okay, that's long enough.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.116
Let's see how they're doing.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.247
Had enough?

11:05.331 --> 11:08.793
(both groaning)

11:08.876 --> 11:10.252
What's say you, men?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.755
Has this lowly maggot
passed the test?

11:12.838 --> 11:16.384
Congratulations, Bart.
You made it.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.928
Hey, what about me?
I'm a lowly maggot.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.685
(gunfire)

11:25.768 --> 11:27.436
Well, since you attended
public school,

11:27.520 --> 11:29.355
I'm going to assume that

11:29.438 --> 11:31.023
you're already proficient
with small arms.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.650
So we'll start you off
with something

11:32.733 --> 11:36.112
-a little more advanced.
-(nervous chuckle)

11:43.244 --> 11:45.788
Four out of five, Simpson--
impressive.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.289
But you missed your last target.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.499
Did I?

11:51.043 --> 11:52.294
Ha-ha!

11:52.378 --> 11:54.672
You're a born
soldier, Simpson.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.549
Too bad it doesn't run
in your family.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.219
Uh, could someone help me?

12:00.302 --> 12:02.304
It's stuck on "auto fire."

12:02.388 --> 12:06.058
-Brad, you hear anything?!
-No!

12:06.142 --> 12:07.727
(gun clicking)

12:07.810 --> 12:10.104
(panting)

12:10.187 --> 12:12.231
Maybe you should
just learn to use this.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.442
If there's a war,
just blow on it,

12:14.525 --> 12:15.776
and I'll come
help you.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.029
(touch-tones beeping)

12:19.113 --> 12:21.115
I am just calling home.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.242
I am not asking to come home.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.077
(phone ringing)

12:25.161 --> 12:27.413
(ringing)

12:27.496 --> 12:30.416
Marge! You got that?

12:30.499 --> 12:32.334
-Marge!
-(yelps)

12:32.418 --> 12:34.462
Hey, go on, boy.

12:34.545 --> 12:35.463
Go get it.

12:35.546 --> 12:36.464
Answer the phone.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.466
D'oh!

12:38.549 --> 12:39.925
There's got to
be something

12:40.009 --> 12:41.677
on this thing
for that thing.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.637
-(ringing stops)
-Ahh.

12:43.721 --> 12:47.183
-(groans)
-(phone ringing)

12:47.266 --> 12:49.810
-Simpson.
-Hot diggity!

12:49.894 --> 12:51.979
I don't care if it's bad news.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.148
Oh, Grampa,
you're not busy, are you?

12:54.231 --> 12:57.735
Well, you're really asking
two questions there.

12:57.818 --> 13:00.488
The first one takes me
back to 1934.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.531
Admiral Byrd had just
reached the pole

13:02.615 --> 13:05.367
only hours ahead
of the three stooges.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.369
And I guess
he won the argument,

13:07.453 --> 13:09.497
but I walked away
with the turnips.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.956
The following morning,

13:11.040 --> 13:13.542
I resigned my commission
in the Coast Guard.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.587
The next thing I heard,
there was civil war in Spain.

13:16.670 --> 13:20.007
And that's everything
that happened in my life

13:20.090 --> 13:22.718
right up to the time
I got this phone call.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.471
Uh-huh. So, anything else
you wanna talk about?

13:25.554 --> 13:29.350
Oh, I'm afraid I'd just be
repeating myself, honey.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.976
(groans)

13:31.060 --> 13:33.187
Anyway, other people need
to use the phone.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.939
ALL: Mm-mmm.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.273
I've already talked to her
for 20 damn minutes.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.234
(groans)

13:40.027 --> 13:42.321
Hmm? Oh!

13:42.404 --> 13:44.490
(laughing, chattering)

13:44.573 --> 13:45.533
BOY: You're all right.

13:45.616 --> 13:46.575
Shh.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.578
What is it?

13:49.662 --> 13:51.539
Bart, I got a cassette
from Mom and Dad.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.791
I thought we could listen
to it together.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.459
Ah, gee, Lise,
I'd love to

13:55.543 --> 13:57.878
but this really
isn't a good time.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.880
-Bart, who you talking to?
-Uh...

13:59.964 --> 14:02.508
Lisa. You're talking to Lisa.

14:02.591 --> 14:03.843
I'm talking to...

14:03.926 --> 14:06.053
No one.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.309
All right, lights out!

14:12.393 --> 14:13.894
(thud)

14:13.978 --> 14:15.062
Ow! Damn it!

14:15.145 --> 14:16.689
Lights on. Lights on.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.649
Lights out. Lights out.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.776
(door slams)

14:22.945 --> 14:24.530
MARGE:
<i>And don't worry, sweetie.</i>

14:24.613 --> 14:27.616
<i>It's very common</i>
<i>to be homesick</i>

14:27.700 --> 14:30.953
<i>when you're so far away from</i>
<i>the people who love you.</i>

14:31.036 --> 14:33.956
Okay,
I'm not going to give up.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.916
Solitude never hurt anyone.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.793
Emily Dickinson lived alone,

14:37.877 --> 14:40.629
and she wrote some
of the most beautiful poetry

14:40.713 --> 14:43.549
the world has ever known--

14:43.632 --> 14:46.343
hmm-- and went crazy
as a loon.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.387
(tape rewinds)

14:48.470 --> 14:53.100
MARGE:
<i>♪ You are my sunshine,</i>
<i>my only sunshine ♪</i>

14:53.183 --> 14:57.313
<i>♪ You make me happy</i>
<i>when skies are gray ♪</i>

14:57.396 --> 15:02.318
<i>♪ You'll never know, dear,</i>
<i>how much I love you ♪</i>

15:02.401 --> 15:06.488
<i>♪ So don't take</i>
<i>my sunshine away ♪</i>

15:10.951 --> 15:12.286
Sorry I froze you out, Lise.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.246
I just didn't want
the guys to think

15:14.330 --> 15:15.789
I'd gone soft
on the girl issue.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.875
I'm tired of
being an issue, Bart.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.502
Maybe everyone would be
better off if I just quit.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.171
But if you quit,
it'd be like

15:22.254 --> 15:24.757
an expert knot-tier quitting
a knot-tying contest

15:24.840 --> 15:26.342
right in the middle
of tying a knot.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.052
Why'd you say that?

15:28.135 --> 15:30.137
I don't know.
I was looking at my shoelaces.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.889
Look, the point is
you're going to make it, Lise,

15:31.972 --> 15:32.890
and I'm gonna stick by you.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.183
Don't do that.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.018
Why should we both be outcasts?

15:36.101 --> 15:38.187
Then I'll just stick
by you in secret

15:38.270 --> 15:40.648
like a sock-maker secretly
working on a top secret sock--

15:40.731 --> 15:42.274
will you stop looking
at your feet?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.985
Well, cadets,
it's been a great year.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.321
You've all worked
very hard developing

15:47.404 --> 15:49.573
academic skills
and general killing skills.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.492
My killing teacher says
I'm a natural.

15:51.575 --> 15:55.621
But these skills are nothing
without courage and stamina.

15:55.704 --> 15:58.916
Traditionally, the academy
tested these virtues

15:58.999 --> 16:00.751
by pitting you
against each other

16:00.834 --> 16:02.836
in a two-day Battle Royale.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.839
-(all gasp)
-That was prior to 1957.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.509
Thank you very much,
State Supreme Court.

16:08.592 --> 16:11.428
Consequently now, no cadet
can receive a passing grade

16:11.512 --> 16:15.307
for the academic year
without first conquering this.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.267
Meet "The Eliminator."

16:17.351 --> 16:19.770
That's a 150-foot
hand-over-hand crawl

16:19.853 --> 16:23.107
across a 60-gauge hemp-jute line
with a blister factor of 12.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.110
The rope is suspended
a full 40 feet

16:26.193 --> 16:29.863
over a solid British acre
of old-growth Connecticut Valley
thorn bushes.

16:29.947 --> 16:33.242
Gentlemen,
welcome to Flavor Country.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.994
This wasn't in the brochure.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.204
(overlapping chatter)

16:39.164 --> 16:41.583
Hey, Bart, come on over here.
There's plenty of room.

16:44.044 --> 16:47.047
"Meet me at the Eliminator
after lights out.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.757
"P.S.--
The cadets are planning

16:48.841 --> 16:50.801
to throw their meatballs
at you."

16:50.884 --> 16:52.261
Hmm.

16:54.304 --> 16:58.559
(groans)

16:58.642 --> 17:00.811
That's it, Lise.
Now start crawling.

17:00.894 --> 17:05.315
Oh, it's too hard.
My hand is slipping.

17:05.399 --> 17:07.151
(screams)

17:10.112 --> 17:13.532
I can't do this, Bart.
I'm not strong enough.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.951
I thought you came here
looking for a challenge.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.788
Duh. A challenge I could do.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.540
It was worth
sneaking into town.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.417
That was some good corn.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.586
Uh-oh.

17:25.669 --> 17:28.797
Uh, hey, Simpson.
What are you doing out here?

17:28.881 --> 17:31.884
-Nothing.
-Nothing?
Doesn't look like nothing.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.511
Oh, yeah?
Well... um...

17:34.595 --> 17:36.096
What are you doing out here?

17:36.180 --> 17:39.600
Uh... also nothing.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.393
Well.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.603
Okay.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.605
-Okay.
-Then carry on.

17:44.688 --> 17:45.647
All right, we will.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.319
(sighs)
That was close.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.154
Bees.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.906
Bees.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.949
BART: Bees? Aah!

17:56.033 --> 17:57.367
-(screaming)
-(body thuds)

17:57.451 --> 18:00.120
Gentlemen,
I regret to inform you

18:00.204 --> 18:02.581
that the State Supreme Court
has determined

18:02.664 --> 18:05.084
that forcing cadets
to cross the eliminator

18:05.167 --> 18:07.461
is a barbaric
and malicious practice.

18:07.544 --> 18:10.964
-Yes!
-Hence, you will be
the last class

18:11.048 --> 18:12.591
to be subjected to it.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.426
Anderson, you're up.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.594
(yelling)

18:24.812 --> 18:26.063
Son of a...

18:26.146 --> 18:27.648
Jeez.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.317
-(sighs)
-Good job, Simpson.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.486
Although that's more cursing
than I like to hear

18:32.569 --> 18:33.946
from a cadet in peace time.

18:34.029 --> 18:37.032
Last up...

18:37.116 --> 18:39.827
Simpson, Lisa.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.957
(playing "Taps")

18:53.382 --> 18:56.677
(shouting insults)

18:56.760 --> 18:59.429
Well, at least
they're talking to me.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.684
(gasps)

19:03.767 --> 19:05.936
(crow caws)

19:16.488 --> 19:17.573
Oh.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.324
(sighs)

19:19.408 --> 19:21.702
If only I were in Springfield,

19:21.785 --> 19:25.080
all my friends would be
cheering me on.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.875
Oh, God, I'm delirious.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.336
-(screaming)
-(cheering)

19:31.420 --> 19:33.672
-(chanting)
-(straining)

19:33.755 --> 19:35.340
Drop, drop, drop,

19:35.424 --> 19:38.010
drop, drop, drop,
drop, drop, drop...

19:38.093 --> 19:40.637
(chanting continues)

19:44.183 --> 19:46.685
You can make it, Lisa.
I know you can.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.187
Come on,
I know you can do it.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.063
Just get your hands
back on the rope.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.899
It's just a little further.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.526
Come on, just a little bit more.
You're doing great.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.112
That's it. Come on,
just a little bit more.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.574
I know you can do it!
I believe in you!

20:05.913 --> 20:08.498
Yes!

20:08.582 --> 20:10.042
You thought I couldn't,

20:10.125 --> 20:11.835
but I could, I did,
and I could do it again.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.921
Let's do it again!

20:14.004 --> 20:15.756
Lisa, it's over;
you made it.

20:15.839 --> 20:17.257
You can put your arms down.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.426
I can't. They're stuck.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.428
We're going to make
your life a living hell

20:21.511 --> 20:23.263
for the rest of the semester.

20:23.347 --> 20:26.433
But graduation's in three hours.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.477
Oh, we better go change.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.854
-♪♪ (fanfare plays)
-The wars of the future

20:30.938 --> 20:33.941
will not be fought
on a battlefield or at sea.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.443
They will be fought in space--

20:36.526 --> 20:39.321
or possibly on top
of a very tall mountain.

20:39.404 --> 20:42.074
In either case,
most of the actual fighting

20:42.157 --> 20:43.617
will be done by small robots,

20:43.700 --> 20:46.662
and as you go forth today,
remember always,

20:46.745 --> 20:51.541
your duty is clear,
to build and maintain
those robots.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.586
-Thank you.
-(cheering)

20:57.047 --> 20:58.048
Well, Bart...

20:58.131 --> 20:59.508
(nervous chuckle)

20:59.591 --> 21:01.677
Did you make sure
to return all the guns?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.804
Sir, yes, sir.
Luckily I am now trained

21:03.887 --> 21:06.723
in six additional forms
of unarmed combat, sir.

21:06.807 --> 21:11.603
-Well, he's got more confidence.
-Uh, yeah.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.648
I've always said the boy
could use more confidence.

21:14.731 --> 21:17.985
Lisa, before you go,

21:18.068 --> 21:20.320
I want to present you
with this.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.739
A medal?

21:22.823 --> 21:23.949
Thank you, sir.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.826
Hmm.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.454
"For satisfactory
completion

21:29.538 --> 21:31.039
of the second grade."

21:31.123 --> 21:32.916
-Oh.
-Well, kids,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.503
we're so proud of the way
you completed military school,

21:36.586 --> 21:40.674
we thought this time,
we'd take you to Disneyland
for real.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.676
-Yay!
-Yay!

21:47.597 --> 21:49.016
