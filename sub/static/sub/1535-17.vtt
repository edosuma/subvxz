WEBVTT

00:02.084 --> 00:03.879
I was unstoppable.

00:03.881 --> 00:05.241
I mean, I was...
I was on fire.

00:05.243 --> 00:08.933
It was like my mind and my body
were totally connected,

00:08.935 --> 00:12.568
like-like athletes must feel
when they're in the zone.

00:12.571 --> 00:15.931
Again, it was
miniature golf.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.489
Admit it, you're a
little turned on.

00:18.491 --> 00:20.520
You can't be this proud.

00:20.522 --> 00:21.961
Why not?

00:21.963 --> 00:25.923
Because I beat you.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.720
Hey.
Hi.

00:27.722 --> 00:29.089
Oh, good. You're back.

00:29.091 --> 00:33.527
We have some
exciting news.

00:33.529 --> 00:35.195
Okay.

00:35.197 --> 00:38.927
As you know, Amy and I have
been together a long time,

00:38.929 --> 00:40.757
and a lot of things

00:40.759 --> 00:44.717
I never thought possible
now seem possible.

00:44.719 --> 00:47.487
Okay...

00:47.489 --> 00:50.745
After a careful evaluation
of our relationship,

00:50.747 --> 00:55.846
we decided that the time was
right to take a step forward.

01:00.974 --> 01:03.733
Okay.

01:03.735 --> 01:05.664
Do you want to say it?

01:05.666 --> 01:08.735
Let's say
it together.

01:08.737 --> 01:12.035
We're getting a turtle!

01:14.066 --> 01:19.063
This is why I've been saying
we should keep champagne on ice.

01:19.065 --> 01:20.189
Sarcasm?

01:20.191 --> 01:21.459
Yes.
Okay.

01:21.461 --> 01:23.625
That was tricky,
'cause when it comes to alcohol,

01:23.627 --> 01:25.991
she generally means business.

01:25.993 --> 01:27.861
Well, we're-we're
very happy for you.

01:27.863 --> 01:29.029
Yes.

01:29.031 --> 01:30.294
Thank you.

01:30.296 --> 01:33.462
Acquiring a joint pet
is a big step for us.

01:33.464 --> 01:34.670
No. It's true.

01:34.672 --> 01:37.037
It means that we care so much
about each other,

01:37.039 --> 01:39.572
there's enough left over
for an eight-ounce reptile.

01:39.574 --> 01:41.476
Why a turtle?

01:41.478 --> 01:45.512
After much deliberation,
we've determined that a turtle

01:45.514 --> 01:46.713
is the ideal pet.

01:46.715 --> 01:50.213
They don't shed fur,
they don't make noise...

01:50.215 --> 01:52.250
For Halloween, we can dress him
as a cobblestone.

01:52.252 --> 01:53.252
Yeah.

01:54.282 --> 01:57.216
And if he ever goes berserk,
I know I can outrun him.

01:57.218 --> 02:01.917
Coincidentally, that's also
why I chose you as a roommate.

02:01.919 --> 02:03.084
Well, congratulations.

02:03.086 --> 02:05.155
Who would've thought
you two would be the first

02:05.157 --> 02:07.153
in our group to start a family?
Mm-hmm.

02:07.155 --> 02:10.453

02:39.505 --> 02:41.541
So, where's
your roommate tonight?

02:41.543 --> 02:43.478
Well, I thought it
was a little unfair

02:43.480 --> 02:45.279
that she's always here,
and you never

02:45.281 --> 02:49.218
get a chance to stay over,
so... I killed her.

02:49.220 --> 02:52.416
But remember our agreement?

02:52.418 --> 02:54.090
You can joke
about murdering people,

02:54.092 --> 02:57.691
but you have to say,
“Just kidding.”

02:57.693 --> 02:59.795
And the more important
thing to remember is

02:59.797 --> 03:02.236
that I'd never hurt you.

03:07.881 --> 03:09.773
Oh, crap.

03:09.775 --> 03:12.781
I have to run over to the
hospital and check on a patient.

03:12.783 --> 03:15.246
That's okay. I can come back later.
No.

03:15.248 --> 03:16.486
No, don't be silly.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.452
I won't be gone long.
Just stay here.

03:18.454 --> 03:19.651
Okay, cool.

03:19.653 --> 03:21.081
Oh, and you're sure
your roommate's

03:21.083 --> 03:22.720
not gonna come back
while I'm here alone, right?

03:22.722 --> 03:24.488
'Cause that'll be awkward.

03:24.490 --> 03:26.088
Oh, don't worry.
She's in Palm Springs.

03:26.090 --> 03:27.056
Oh, good.

03:27.058 --> 03:29.560
Well, her torso is.

03:30.731 --> 03:32.329
Just kidding.

03:33.267 --> 03:35.528
I put her in a wood chipper.

03:38.498 --> 03:40.834
Oh, dear Lord.
Oh, dear Lord.

03:40.836 --> 03:42.370
It's okay.

03:42.372 --> 03:44.378
You made it.
We're fine.

03:44.380 --> 03:48.944
That was a lot of puppies.

03:48.946 --> 03:51.111
Let's forget about them, and...

03:51.113 --> 03:52.911
pick ourselves out
a nice turtle.

03:52.913 --> 03:55.318
Yeah.
Oh, how about this one up on the log?

03:55.320 --> 03:57.086
Oh, I don't know.

03:57.088 --> 03:59.087
He kind of looks
like a jerk.

04:01.361 --> 04:03.421
How about this one?

04:03.423 --> 04:05.955
Well, he's barely moving.
He looks half dead.

04:05.957 --> 04:08.627
I know. I like him, too.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.360
Hi, little guy.

04:12.362 --> 04:14.834
How'd you like
to come home with us?

04:14.836 --> 04:19.267
You'll be living with me because
we don't live in the same house.

04:19.269 --> 04:20.906
But that's not your fault.

04:20.909 --> 04:24.214
Like you, we're taking it
ridiculously slow.

04:25.712 --> 04:30.252
You'll stay with me when he's
at Comic-Con or away for work.

04:30.254 --> 04:35.384
Or if they accept Daddy's
application to live on Mars.

04:35.386 --> 04:37.183
What are you talking about?

04:37.185 --> 04:38.855
Oh, there's this company

04:38.857 --> 04:41.394
that's attempting
to establish a colony on Mars,

04:41.396 --> 04:43.965
and I applied
to be among the first to go.

04:43.967 --> 04:45.661
What should
we name him?

04:45.663 --> 04:50.373
You know, I came in
thinking “Seth,” but...

04:50.375 --> 04:53.003
he kind of looks Italian.

04:53.005 --> 04:55.305
You applied for a mission

04:55.307 --> 04:57.442
to be a colonist
on another planet,

04:57.444 --> 04:59.674
and couldn't be bothered
to tell me?

05:01.442 --> 05:03.112
Would you have approved?

05:03.114 --> 05:04.449
Of course not.

05:04.451 --> 05:06.513
Well, based on
your reaction,

05:06.515 --> 05:08.683
it looks like I made
the right choice.

05:09.956 --> 05:11.786
Isn't that right, Giuseppe?

05:15.766 --> 05:17.900
Hey, hey.

05:17.902 --> 05:20.871
Listen, I-I have a little
confession to make.

05:20.873 --> 05:23.809
Aw, is this your first time?

05:25.610 --> 05:28.410
No, I got you something
for Valentine's Day,

05:28.412 --> 05:30.587
and I was too embarrassed
to give it to you.

05:30.589 --> 05:31.955
Well, why?

05:31.957 --> 05:36.158
Well, 'cause I got it
at the dirty store.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.359
You went to the dirty store
without me?!

05:39.761 --> 05:43.933
In sunglasses and a hat after
I parked two blocks away.

05:43.935 --> 05:46.163
Well, get it! Get it for me!
Yeah?

05:46.165 --> 05:48.698
Yeah.
Okay, uh, well, I hope it's fun.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.434
I mean, it-it comes
with paints, and-and

05:51.436 --> 05:53.305
it's kind of creative
and artistic.

05:53.307 --> 05:56.875
Okay, did you go to
the dirty store or Michaels?

05:57.709 --> 05:59.515
No, no.

05:59.517 --> 06:01.650
We cover ourselves
in body paint,

06:01.652 --> 06:05.184
and then-then we get on this
big canvas and do our thing.

06:05.186 --> 06:07.888
Whoa, that's kind of
a big step for a guy

06:07.890 --> 06:10.857
who only recently agreed
to take his socks off.

06:10.859 --> 06:13.285
You're making fun of me.
Forget it.

06:13.287 --> 06:15.254
No! No, come on, I want to do it.
Really?

06:15.256 --> 06:17.127
Yeah, let's you, me,

06:17.129 --> 06:19.830
and your very, very pale feet
make some art.

06:21.167 --> 06:23.663
Hey, when you got back to this
store, I want to go with you.

06:23.665 --> 06:27.706
Okay, but it's a drive-- the
one I went to is in San Diego.

06:28.909 --> 06:31.179
How are the taxes going?

06:31.181 --> 06:32.778
Okay.

06:32.780 --> 06:36.347
But you got a lot of receipts
for the Lego store in here.

06:37.853 --> 06:39.221
Those are business expenses.

06:39.223 --> 06:41.758
You can write those off.

06:41.760 --> 06:45.463
A $200 R2-D2 is
a business expense?

06:46.264 --> 06:47.533
Oh, Bernie,

06:47.535 --> 06:49.596
you're gonna have to sound
a lot more confident

06:49.598 --> 06:51.468
when we get audited.

06:55.436 --> 06:58.002
Hey, what's up?

06:58.004 --> 07:00.011
Eh, Emily ran back
to the hospital,

07:00.013 --> 07:01.978
so I'm just hanging out
at her place.

07:01.980 --> 07:03.704
What are you, uh,
what are you doing?

07:03.706 --> 07:07.575
Just playing video games
while Bernie does the taxes.

07:07.577 --> 07:10.215
What are you, a little kid?

07:10.217 --> 07:13.012
Is she gonna cut your dinner
into little pieces, too?

07:13.014 --> 07:17.583
She doesn't have to--
I filled up on jelly beans.

07:17.585 --> 07:20.917
So, uh, what game are you...

07:20.919 --> 07:22.242
Oh.

07:22.244 --> 07:23.912
Crap.

07:23.914 --> 07:24.808
What's wrong?

07:24.832 --> 07:27.102
I can't get Emily's
nightstand to close.

07:27.181 --> 07:28.046
So?

07:28.070 --> 07:30.109
She's gonna know
I was looking in it.

07:30.147 --> 07:32.347
Why were you looking in it?

07:32.349 --> 07:33.589
Well, there's a question

07:33.591 --> 07:36.456
I better have a good answer to
before she gets back.

07:36.458 --> 07:37.695
Okay, calm down.

07:37.697 --> 07:39.191
There's probably something
jammed behind it.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.159
Just, uh, pull it out
and see what's there.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.327
Hang on.

07:46.303 --> 07:48.933
Oh... no. Oh, no.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.468
Oh, God, no!

07:51.902 --> 07:54.140
You know what, you sound busy--
I'm gonna let you go.

07:55.310 --> 07:57.244
Dude, the whole front came off.

07:57.246 --> 07:58.907
Now she's gonna know
I was snooping.

07:58.909 --> 08:00.242
What's happening?

08:00.244 --> 08:03.244
Raj was snooping through
Emily's drawers and broke one.

08:03.246 --> 08:04.579
Aw.

08:04.581 --> 08:07.312
I'm gonna miss her.

08:08.482 --> 08:10.886
So what do you think?

08:12.518 --> 08:16.353
I thought it'd be
a little more... just more.

08:20.457 --> 08:23.358
I'm not even sure
why we were out of breath.

08:25.128 --> 08:28.190
Uh, I mean, d-did
we move at all?

08:28.192 --> 08:30.126
Maybe along the z-axis,

08:30.128 --> 08:32.861
but x and y are looking
pretty sad.

08:33.664 --> 08:34.934
Okay, come on.

08:34.937 --> 08:36.638
We are not old
boring people.

08:36.640 --> 08:37.966
We can do better
than this.

08:37.967 --> 08:38.900
Uh, Th-that's true.

08:38.903 --> 08:40.802
How late did we stay up
last night?

08:40.804 --> 08:43.504
Almost 1:00 a.m.

08:43.506 --> 08:46.776
Damn straight, almost 1:00 a.m.

08:48.578 --> 08:49.809
And we weren't even watching TV.

08:49.811 --> 08:53.177
We were watching Netflix,
like the kids do.

08:53.179 --> 08:54.481
Yeah, is it a comedy?

08:54.483 --> 08:55.817
Is it a drama?

08:55.819 --> 08:57.321
Nobody knows.

08:57.323 --> 08:59.122
Now, come on.

08:59.124 --> 09:00.819
We are gonna do this.
Yeah.

09:00.821 --> 09:02.723
You get the paint,
I'll rest for 30-40 minutes,

09:02.725 --> 09:04.888
and then we do this!

09:05.993 --> 09:08.327
I can't believe you
almost had me bring

09:08.329 --> 09:11.693
a wild animal
into my home.

09:11.695 --> 09:14.459
No one told you to poke
the turtle's face.

09:15.260 --> 09:18.956
I was playing
“Got Your Nose”"

09:18.958 --> 09:21.057
That's how you get
children to like you.

09:22.994 --> 09:24.959
I'm surprised you even care
if he likes you,

09:24.961 --> 09:26.527
since you're planning
on leaving the planet

09:26.529 --> 09:28.167
the first chance you get.

09:28.169 --> 09:29.567
Ugh, this again.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.639
Amy, I've already had one new
hole torn in my body today.

09:32.641 --> 09:35.007
I don't need another one.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.241
Sheldon, I know the odds

09:37.243 --> 09:39.482
of you even going to Mars
are incredibly small,

09:39.484 --> 09:42.149
but it still hurts
that you would volunteer

09:42.151 --> 09:44.886
for something that would
take you away from me forever.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.222
So you're saying you
wouldn't leave me

09:47.224 --> 09:49.389
for the chance to be
one of the first humans

09:49.391 --> 09:51.059
to colonize
another planet?

09:51.061 --> 09:53.025
I would at least mention it

09:53.027 --> 09:54.856
before filling out
the application.

09:54.858 --> 09:58.160
Huh, that's exactly what
Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali,

09:58.162 --> 09:59.561
Bernadette and
Penny said.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.736
And who says
you could even survive

10:02.738 --> 10:04.568
an interplanetary
mission, anyway?

10:04.570 --> 10:06.904
You could barely survive
a tiny turtle bite.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.903
First of all, this...

10:08.905 --> 10:11.608
has only made me stronger.

10:11.610 --> 10:13.608
But beyond that, all I did

10:13.610 --> 10:15.246
was fill out an application.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.245
You know what?

10:17.247 --> 10:19.414
Go to Mars, Sheldon.

10:22.056 --> 10:24.716
Is there anything I can
do to cheer you up?

10:24.718 --> 10:26.283
No. Forget it.

10:27.357 --> 10:29.658
What if I play the <i> Star Trek</i>
theme on my nose?

10:29.660 --> 10:32.829
Please don't.

10:38.770 --> 10:40.536
Yep, you're mad.

10:48.475 --> 10:50.209
Okay, let me see the damage.

10:50.211 --> 10:51.712
Hang on.

10:52.849 --> 10:54.880
Well, I think you
broke the dowels.

10:54.882 --> 10:56.312
You're not gonna
have time to glue it

10:56.314 --> 10:57.617
back on--
you'll have to nail it.

10:57.619 --> 10:58.753
With what?

10:58.755 --> 11:01.423
Does she have any
pillows or wine glasses?

11:01.425 --> 11:02.550
She does.

11:02.552 --> 11:03.589
Great.

11:03.591 --> 11:06.485
Neither of those.
Try a hammer!

11:09.022 --> 11:10.523
Did that feel good?

11:10.525 --> 11:12.627
You feel like a big man now?

11:16.195 --> 11:18.727
I was going to make you
red zinger,

11:18.729 --> 11:21.696
but since Mars
is the red planet,

11:21.698 --> 11:24.471
I went with peppermint.

11:26.809 --> 11:28.671
Why do you even want to do this?

11:28.673 --> 11:30.838
Actually...

11:30.840 --> 11:33.606
as part of the application,

11:33.608 --> 11:36.385
I was required
to make a short video

11:36.387 --> 11:38.819
answering that very question.

11:38.821 --> 11:40.589
You want to see it?

11:40.591 --> 11:41.821
Can't you just tell me?

11:41.823 --> 11:44.029
But I made a video.

11:45.863 --> 11:48.365
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

11:48.367 --> 11:51.603
and I'd like to tell you
why I should be chosen to...

11:53.468 --> 11:55.936
go to Mars!

11:57.073 --> 11:58.534
I'm exceedingly smart.

11:58.536 --> 12:00.702
I graduated college at 14.

12:00.704 --> 12:02.470
While my brother
was getting an STD

12:02.472 --> 12:04.837
I was getting a PhD.

12:07.015 --> 12:10.446
Penicillin can't take this away.

12:10.448 --> 12:14.254
Being in close quarters,
cleanliness is important

12:14.256 --> 12:17.518
and... my hygiene is impeccable.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.621
In fact, animals don't trust me

12:19.623 --> 12:21.663
because I smell like nothing.

12:21.665 --> 12:22.632
Yeah...

12:23.499 --> 12:25.835
Literally nothing.

12:28.606 --> 12:30.173
During the seven-month
space flight,

12:30.175 --> 12:33.812
I can keep up morale
with my wacky sense of humor.

12:35.953 --> 12:37.687
Hey, Leonard...

12:37.689 --> 12:40.425
is there any peanut brittle
left in that can?

12:40.427 --> 12:43.689
You mean this weirdly
suspicious one?

12:43.691 --> 12:46.361
Yes. Open it and check.

12:50.833 --> 12:52.998
I don't get it.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.966
There's actually
peanut brittle in...

13:01.175 --> 13:03.372
Please go to Mars.

13:05.341 --> 13:07.378
But on a more serious note:

13:07.380 --> 13:08.842
The most important reason I want

13:08.844 --> 13:11.881
to go to Mars is that
I believe, as a scientist,

13:11.883 --> 13:14.746
it's my duty
to push the boundaries

13:14.748 --> 13:17.123
of human knowledge forward.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.857
Now, I know that life on Mars
will be difficult.

13:19.859 --> 13:23.022
But life here on Earth
is no picnic.

13:23.024 --> 13:25.523
Also, picnics are no picnic.

13:26.892 --> 13:28.323
Where should we go for lunch?

13:28.325 --> 13:30.596
Oh, I know, the ground.

13:31.631 --> 13:32.888
In conclusion,

13:32.890 --> 13:34.455
thank you for considering me

13:34.457 --> 13:37.327
for this journey of a lifetime.

13:38.666 --> 13:40.897
To Mars!

13:43.004 --> 13:45.643
Afterwards,
Leonard blew his nose,

13:45.645 --> 13:48.110
and pie came out.

13:51.084 --> 13:53.846
Right there, right there,

13:53.848 --> 13:55.677
Oh, God, that's it!

13:58.843 --> 14:00.608
How did you get paint
in your eye?

14:00.610 --> 14:04.513
Because you wouldn't let me
wear safety goggles!

14:07.889 --> 14:10.024
This looks terrible.

14:10.026 --> 14:11.257
She-she's gonna know.

14:11.259 --> 14:12.289
It's fine.

14:12.291 --> 14:13.890
You just need two more nails.

14:13.892 --> 14:14.930
Okay, where should I put them?

14:14.932 --> 14:16.363
In Emily's eyes.

14:19.036 --> 14:20.330
You're not helping.

14:20.332 --> 14:23.033
Well, maybe this is
what you get for snooping.

14:23.035 --> 14:24.472
You know, it-it's bad enough
that I have to deal with this...

14:24.474 --> 14:26.407
Raj? I'm back.

14:26.409 --> 14:28.574
Oh, no.

14:29.007 --> 14:30.708
Hey.
Hi.

14:30.710 --> 14:34.078
How was the hospital?

14:34.080 --> 14:35.615
Fine.

14:35.617 --> 14:37.280
What were you doing in there?

14:38.586 --> 14:40.952
Uh... w-well...

14:41.986 --> 14:43.319
Okay, look, I-I don't
want to lie to you.

14:43.321 --> 14:45.823
I-I got curious,
I was looking around...

14:45.825 --> 14:48.423
and I broke the drawer
on your night stand.

14:48.425 --> 14:50.391
You were looking
in my night stand?

14:50.393 --> 14:51.663
Yeah.

14:51.665 --> 14:53.630
So, the first time
I leave you alone,

14:53.632 --> 14:55.367
you snoop on me?

14:55.369 --> 14:58.241
You've never snooped
around my apartment?

14:58.243 --> 15:01.208
No!
Come on, think back.

15:01.210 --> 15:04.376
It would really help if you had!

15:04.378 --> 15:06.208
I can't believe
you don't trust me!

15:06.210 --> 15:09.217
She sounds really mad.

15:09.219 --> 15:11.250
We should hang up.

15:11.252 --> 15:12.851
Yeah, we should.

15:12.853 --> 15:14.589
But we're not
going to, are we?

15:14.591 --> 15:17.064
Not a chance.

15:17.066 --> 15:19.466
What happened to
“snooping is wrong”?

15:19.468 --> 15:21.508
Howard, you're going
to jail for tax fraud.

15:21.510 --> 15:24.174
Who cares?

15:25.383 --> 15:26.947
Well, we did it.

15:26.949 --> 15:30.715
We sure did.

15:30.717 --> 15:32.016
I mean, I was on fire!

15:32.018 --> 15:34.309
I-I was in the zone,
like an athlete.

15:34.311 --> 15:36.872
Sweetie, I beat
you at this, too.

15:36.874 --> 15:39.141
So, where do we
want to hang it?

15:39.143 --> 15:40.277
What? Are you kidding?

15:40.279 --> 15:41.740
We're not hanging it!

15:41.742 --> 15:43.810
But it's an expression
of our love.

15:43.812 --> 15:46.481
And our butts!
Not hanging it!

15:47.852 --> 15:49.819
Seems a shame to throw it away.

15:49.821 --> 15:51.556
Yeah.

15:52.655 --> 15:53.895
We could give it to Sheldon,

15:53.897 --> 15:56.864
and tell him William
Shatner painted it.

15:58.634 --> 16:01.830
God, I love you.
I love you so much.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.237
I think I'm gonna go home.

16:07.239 --> 16:09.669
Why?

16:09.671 --> 16:12.644
I really don't understand
what's happening here.

16:12.646 --> 16:15.380
You know, Sheldon,
at any other time,

16:15.382 --> 16:17.812
learning that you had plans
to go live on Mars

16:17.814 --> 16:19.547
would be a slow news day.

16:19.549 --> 16:21.546
But a couple of hours ago,

16:21.548 --> 16:23.449
we were getting a turtle.

16:23.451 --> 16:26.016
And silly as it sounds,

16:26.018 --> 16:28.454
I thought that meant something.

16:30.151 --> 16:32.085
Amy!

16:32.087 --> 16:35.058
Oh, why didn't I give her
Sleepy Time tea?

16:37.322 --> 16:38.991
Amy, wait!

16:38.993 --> 16:41.494
Getting a turtle meant
a great deal to me, too.

16:41.496 --> 16:42.959
Sure.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.758
Unless something
better comes along.

16:44.760 --> 16:48.532
Do you want me
to withdraw my application?

16:48.534 --> 16:51.228
What I want is for us

16:51.230 --> 16:54.268
to be planning our
future together.

16:56.176 --> 16:58.917
And in that future,

16:58.918 --> 17:00.900
are we on the same planet?

17:01.744 --> 17:03.278
Yeah, because I've seen people

17:03.280 --> 17:04.981
make the long-distance
thing work.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.915
We're on the same planet!
Okay!

17:09.382 --> 17:13.018
Does that planet have
to be Earth?

17:13.923 --> 17:16.488
Are you asking me to go
to Mars with you?

17:16.490 --> 17:18.089
I am.

17:18.092 --> 17:19.722
Yeah, if I'm going
to a barren,

17:19.723 --> 17:21.657
lifeless environment,

17:21.660 --> 17:25.065
where the chances of survival
are slim to none,

17:25.067 --> 17:28.460
I want you there with me.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.632
Why don't we go back
to the apartment,

17:34.634 --> 17:36.430
and fill out your application?

17:37.263 --> 17:39.994
Okay.

17:39.996 --> 17:42.832
I suppose being
the first people

17:42.834 --> 17:45.133
on a new planet would
be incredibly exciting.

17:45.135 --> 17:46.827
Oh, I know.

17:46.829 --> 17:50.500
We could be the first
to plant a flag on Mars.

17:50.502 --> 17:54.267
We could be the first to
watch <i> Mars Attacks!</i> on Mars.

17:54.269 --> 17:57.043
We could be the first
to say “Good Lord,

17:57.045 --> 17:59.740
what on Mars are
you talking about”"

17:59.742 --> 18:02.043
You know,

18:02.045 --> 18:04.377
we could also be
the first people

18:04.379 --> 18:07.616
to procreate on Mars.

18:07.618 --> 18:11.485
You just can't keep it in
your space pants, can you?

18:13.382 --> 18:14.180
Think about it.

18:14.182 --> 18:15.388
If we had a family there,

18:15.390 --> 18:17.956
our kids would be Martians.

18:18.926 --> 18:22.557
They would, wouldn't they?

18:22.559 --> 18:25.429
We could give them
cool Martian names.

18:25.431 --> 18:28.196
And we could teach them
about Martian history.

18:28.198 --> 18:30.035
Like, who planted those flags?

18:30.037 --> 18:31.531
And, uh, where did that copy

18:31.533 --> 18:34.139
of <i> Mars Attacks!</i> come from?

18:34.141 --> 18:35.475
I guess we'll have to make

18:35.477 --> 18:37.675
a new video together,
as a couple.

18:37.677 --> 18:39.843
Good idea.

18:41.477 --> 18:43.346
And since you've had
such a rough day,

18:43.348 --> 18:46.714
I'm gonna let you throw
the pie in Leonard's face.

18:48.000 --> 18:54.074

18:56.446 --> 18:58.044
Thank you for forgiving me.

18:58.046 --> 18:59.444
It's okay.

18:59.446 --> 19:02.316
At some point, we were bound
to have our first fight.

19:02.318 --> 19:04.316
Well, it almost happened
when you called

19:04.318 --> 19:06.556
my apple pie crust “doughy”"

19:08.358 --> 19:10.354
The truth is
you were right.

19:10.356 --> 19:13.161
And I was just
angry at myself.

19:13.163 --> 19:16.329
Can I ask you one thing?

19:16.331 --> 19:17.696
Of course. What?

19:17.698 --> 19:20.295
Did you look in my closet?

19:20.297 --> 19:22.631
No. Just the drawer.

19:22.633 --> 19:24.335
You promise you didn't
look in the closet?

19:24.337 --> 19:25.366
I promise.

19:25.368 --> 19:26.766
Why, what's in there?

19:26.768 --> 19:28.869
Don't worry about it.

19:28.871 --> 19:30.174
Good night.
