WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:06.505
I don't understand.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.106
I told you.

00:08.109 --> 00:11.176
He's more use alive than dead.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.078
More use to who?

00:13.080 --> 00:14.546
I can't tell you that.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.248
The government
gave Carlos mejia,

00:16.250 --> 00:21.020
the man who gunned me down in
cold blood, a deal?

00:21.022 --> 00:22.721
Yes.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.157
And you let that happen.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.026
I didn't have a choice, Cali.

00:27.028 --> 00:29.461
You didn't have a choice.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.096
That doesn't sound like you.

00:41.274 --> 00:42.307
Mills.

00:42.309 --> 00:43.409
You need to come in.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.510
What's going on?

00:44.512 --> 00:45.744
<i>Tell you when you get here.</i>

00:45.746 --> 00:48.480
- No, now.
- They're moving mejia.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.816
I got to go.

01:14.441 --> 01:16.075
Go.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.485
Patch in NSA, nro, Langley.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.854
Whoever can get us full
satellite cover the quickest.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.289
- What?
- They're telling me

01:30.291 --> 01:31.723
FBI is lead on this now.

01:31.725 --> 01:34.359
Once we deliver mejia to them,
we're relieved.

01:34.361 --> 01:36.395
Says who? No, don't answer that.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.330
The white house.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.845
You're up early today.

01:52.847 --> 01:54.813
Sorry, I didn't mean
to wake you.

01:54.815 --> 01:58.283
You know where the lid is?

01:58.285 --> 02:00.152
Clean.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.720
Thanks.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.689
Got an emergency meeting
at the office.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.458
Some it panic.
Bob landers called.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.860
You want me
to make you something?

02:07.862 --> 02:10.329
I can grab a bagel on the way.
It's okay.

02:10.330 --> 02:15.167
No, take some fruit.

02:15.169 --> 02:16.535
Right.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.537
George salt, did you just roll
your eyes at me?

02:18.539 --> 02:20.539
- No...
- Yeah, you did.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.742
On the inside.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.611
What are you trying to say?

02:25.613 --> 02:29.681
That I love you, and that
I want you to live forever.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.620
Love you too.

02:34.622 --> 02:38.223
One more kiss,
and make it a good one.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.296
Here.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.598
I'll see you tonight.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.175
Drive safe, baby.

02:56.177 --> 02:59.478
<i>We have been ordered to hand
over Carlos mejia to the FBI</i>

02:59.480 --> 03:02.314
because somehow Mexico
has found out we have him,

03:02.316 --> 03:03.649
and now they want him back.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.384
So we're just gonna
hand him over?

03:05.386 --> 03:07.519
Wait a minute, how the hell
did they find out we have him?

03:07.521 --> 03:09.922
- I don't know yet.
- Did anyone else know,

03:09.924 --> 03:12.457
apart from us?
No, no. They did not.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.426
So we've been compromised.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.461
Our security's been breached.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.530
That's a possibility
we have to consider.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.966
Yes, absolutely.
We can't let this happen.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.901
What do you suggest we do,
pop a nine-mil in the back

03:22.903 --> 03:24.570
of mejia's head
while we still got him?

03:24.572 --> 03:25.837
I know, how about we just

03:25.839 --> 03:30.676
send Mexico some more American
jobs instead?

03:30.678 --> 03:32.411
What if the cartel
are behind this?

03:32.413 --> 03:33.979
Pulling the strings...
of the Mexican government?

03:33.981 --> 03:35.647
You don't think that's possible?

03:35.649 --> 03:37.549
I think you're reaching
because you don't want

03:37.551 --> 03:39.518
your sister's murderer slipping
through your grasp.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.453
Which I totally get, by the way.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.288
I feel you, bro.

03:43.290 --> 03:44.856
But our hands are well
and truly tied here.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.892
Where and when are we handing
him over to the feds?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.594
We're still waiting
for the final

03:48.596 --> 03:50.462
instructions from Quantico.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.997
Sometime in the nest 24 hours.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
This has the cartel all over it.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.667
He's not wrong
to think like that.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.936
No. No, he's not.

03:57.938 --> 04:01.974
Okay, I'm gonna ask this once
and only once.

04:01.976 --> 04:05.444
Has anyone in this room, at any
time, for whatever reason,

04:05.446 --> 04:09.481
told anyone else about our
incarceration of Carlos mejia?

04:27.401 --> 04:29.534
- Whoa.
- Come in.

04:29.536 --> 04:31.003
Sorry, I was at
a client breakfast.

04:31.005 --> 04:35.407
I came as quickly as I could.
What's up?

04:35.409 --> 04:37.309
What is it?

04:37.311 --> 04:39.645
Did you tell anyone
about Carlos mejia?

04:39.647 --> 04:41.847
- Excuse me?
- Please, I don't have the time.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.482
I just need to know...
tell anyone what

04:43.484 --> 04:45.417
about Carlos mejia?
Anything I told you.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.752
No, I have not.

04:46.754 --> 04:47.953
You sure?

04:47.955 --> 04:50.956
Yes. Bryan, I'd never...

04:50.958 --> 04:52.958
- Well, they found out somehow.
- Who found out? Found out what?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.726
- Mexican government.
- Okay, wait. Slow down...

04:54.728 --> 04:56.595
probably the cartel too.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.630
And you think that's because
I said something to someone?

04:58.632 --> 04:59.865
Not even accidentally?

04:59.867 --> 05:01.433
Like at the hair salon
or something?

05:01.435 --> 05:03.402
That's not what I meant.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.337
I thought we understood
each other.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.639
Respected...

05:07.641 --> 05:11.076
No.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.578
Actually, I thought it was quite
a bit more than just that.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.981
I am the one person who
understands what you've

05:15.983 --> 05:18.350
gone through at the hands
of this monster mejia.

05:18.352 --> 05:21.386
And now you're accusing me
of betraying you?

05:21.388 --> 05:23.055
- Not betraying me.
- So what, then?

05:23.057 --> 05:26.058
I had to ask, asha,
and I know you know why,

05:26.060 --> 05:28.393
so don't act like you don't...
I'm not confused.

05:28.395 --> 05:31.797
I'm upset.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.532
You immediately suspect me.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.833
People at your job knew too.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.770
They keep secrets for a living.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.573
You trust them more than me.

05:41.575 --> 05:45.677
I trust you enough
to be honest about this.

05:45.679 --> 05:49.014
Look at this place.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.751
Locks, cameras everywhere.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.620
You obviously think someone
is watching you.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.356
But as soon as something
bad happens,

05:57.358 --> 06:00.025
you point the finger at me?

06:00.027 --> 06:02.361
<i>How do you know you haven't
been hacked or broken into?</i>

06:02.363 --> 06:04.429
<i>Have you even considered that?</i>

07:16.770 --> 07:18.737
My god. What is it?

07:18.739 --> 07:20.505
It's a bug.

07:20.507 --> 07:23.708
Probably one of many.

07:23.710 --> 07:26.645
They've been watching us.

07:26.647 --> 07:27.946
Who?

07:27.948 --> 07:29.448
Mejia.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.483
His people.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.021
Okay.

07:36.023 --> 07:39.491
This is getting creepy.

07:39.493 --> 07:42.194
I...

07:42.196 --> 07:44.162
I think I'm just gonna go now.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.664
Asha, no.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.766
Look, I'm sorry I blamed you.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.135
It's gone too far, Bryan.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.571
I don't know what you're doing
or who you are.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.005
Yes, you do. You know me.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.707
No.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.576
I can't do this.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.678
Sorry.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.246
I...

08:01.248 --> 08:04.115
I don't feel safe here.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.884
I don't know you.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.820
You've never really let me in.

08:08.822 --> 08:12.858
I work for a government
intelligence organization.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.894
We report directly
to the president.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.996
The president?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.731
Our mission is to keep
the country and her

08:19.733 --> 08:23.902
safe by any means necessary.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.670
Who else knows this about you?

08:25.672 --> 08:29.107
Just the people at work.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.176
And now you.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.592
Salt.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.761
<i>Marie?</i>

08:49.763 --> 08:51.296
<i>Marie, are you there?</i>

08:51.298 --> 08:52.631
George?

08:52.633 --> 08:54.199
<i>Listen very carefully.</i>

08:54.201 --> 08:56.801
<i>We have your husband.
Do you want him to live?</i>

08:56.803 --> 08:58.036
<i>Do you want him to live?</i>

08:58.038 --> 08:59.838
What? Yes. Yes.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.642
<i>You're gonna do exactly
what we tell you.</i>

09:03.644 --> 09:05.844
<i>Or George will die.</i>

09:11.919 --> 09:15.320
At 0440 hours tomorrow,
FBI and odni

09:15.322 --> 09:17.789
will be leaving this facility
with Carlos mejia

09:17.791 --> 09:20.058
and transporting him
to us prison Lee

09:20.060 --> 09:22.227
in pennington gap, Virginia.

09:49.922 --> 09:54.292
We must assume the treat of
ambush or interception is high.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.695
The move to the prison
is in phases,

09:56.697 --> 09:58.630
the final one being
a ground approach

09:58.632 --> 10:00.031
along a classified route

10:00.033 --> 10:02.100
at a classified time
of departure.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.903
As of right now, FBI will be
taking lead.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.672
The odni will be in support

10:07.674 --> 10:09.074
and will provide backup.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.009
FBI deputy director martello

10:11.011 --> 10:12.978
is now in overall command.

10:12.980 --> 10:16.247
We will be taking local roads
to the destination.

10:16.249 --> 10:19.918
And due to the highly-sensitive
nature of this assignment,

10:19.920 --> 10:22.220
state and local law enforcement
have not been notified.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.789
We're keeping this under
the radar as much as possible.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.891
Lean and mean.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.027
Any questions, feel free to talk

10:29.029 --> 10:31.796
to the special agent in charge
on this operation...

10:31.798 --> 10:34.866
Marie salt.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.391
Hey, partner.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.026
Walt.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.761
- You okay?
- Yeah, why?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.763
I don't know, just seem
uncharacteristically...

11:04.765 --> 11:06.431
just staying frosty,
as should you.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.134
- I'm fine.
- Copy that.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.369
Weapons check in ten.
I'll be there. Thank you.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.405
Agent salt? Bryan mills.
You got a minute?

11:13.407 --> 11:15.373
I know who you are.
I've been briefed.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.942
You also need to know
I think this whole move

11:17.944 --> 11:19.444
is a cartel play to free mejia.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.945
Based on what?

11:20.947 --> 11:22.947
I don't have the link,
but I know mejia.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.349
I think they're gonna try
and take him.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.184
I appreciate your concern,
but we've gone

11:26.186 --> 11:28.319
over this with white gloves...
There's no cartel link here.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.088
Or we haven't found it yet.
They probably got someone

11:30.090 --> 11:31.790
in here right now
with eyes on us.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.291
Mills, I brought in four
of my best agents,

11:33.293 --> 11:34.759
and you brought in yours.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.127
We are prepped for all
eventualities.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.362
I'd also like to see the
convoy configuration

11:37.364 --> 11:39.130
and route maps.
All those will be made

11:39.132 --> 11:40.899
available tomorrow morning...
but if we vet them now,

11:40.901 --> 11:43.234
we can still make changes.
Odni is here to support

11:43.236 --> 11:44.736
the FBI, not
the other way around.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.037
I understand that, ma'am,
but we do have

11:46.039 --> 11:47.839
a history with the detainee.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.974
Which is why you're no longer
responsible for him.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.076
Maybe if you'd followed
protocol,

11:51.078 --> 11:52.277
we wouldn't have to move him.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.478
If we'd followed protocol,
we never

11:53.480 --> 11:55.046
would've captured him
to start with.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.816
Maybe you should just
sit this one out.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.184
I want to be
in the Van with him.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.086
No, no.

12:01.088 --> 12:05.790
See, I understand there's a lot
of personal history here.

12:05.792 --> 12:09.294
Look, you need to trust me,
special agent salt.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.796
No, you need to trust me.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.798
Stay tuned.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.506
You're leaving.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.041
Headed back to the office.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.410
I'll monitor everything
from there.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.011
You got to call this off.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.781
Unless there is a new,
specific threat, there is...

12:29.783 --> 12:31.483
right now, the threat is us.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.151
We're making every mistake
in the book.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.887
Marie salt is
a highly-decorated agent.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.355
Apparently, she's one of
their best.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.390
She is not taking this
seriously enough.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.260
You've been ordered to be here
in a supportive role.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.028
Do you understand
what that means?

12:44.030 --> 12:45.764
I'm not gonna stand by
and keep my mouth shut

12:45.766 --> 12:47.999
when we're doing exactly
what the cartel wants.

12:48.001 --> 12:51.035
You know they want us to move
mejia so they can take him.

12:55.241 --> 12:59.043
You can't win this on a theory,
Bryan.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.880
I have to play the cards
I've been dealt.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.791
Then get me in to see him.

13:12.793 --> 13:17.028
At least let me put
a contingency into play.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.304
Jesus.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.573
Fine, my ass.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.442
This is the women's
bathroom, Walt.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.383
You want to tell me
what's going on?

13:38.385 --> 13:41.152
It must have been
something I ate, I...

13:41.154 --> 13:42.821
Something you ate.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.989
<i>And now I... i feel better.</i>

13:44.991 --> 13:48.226
- I think.
- What'd you eat?

13:48.228 --> 13:49.961
What's gotten into you?

13:49.963 --> 13:51.563
I know you, Marie.

13:51.565 --> 13:53.331
And I know when something's up.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.233
And you know I'm gonna dig it

13:55.235 --> 13:56.501
out of you sooner or later.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.571
Lamb. I ate lamb.

13:59.573 --> 14:01.339
<i>Now, do you mind?</i>

14:01.341 --> 14:03.441
<i>A little privacy, please?</i>

14:11.952 --> 14:13.451
<i>You're gonna do exactly...</i>

14:13.453 --> 14:16.588
<i>You're gonna do exactly
what we tell you.</i>

14:16.590 --> 14:18.890
<i>Or George will die.</i>

14:53.492 --> 14:56.127
How are you, Bryan?

15:07.973 --> 15:11.442
I want you to know,

15:11.444 --> 15:13.945
whatever this is,

15:13.947 --> 15:17.548
whatever you've got going on,

15:17.550 --> 15:19.584
I'll be there to stop it.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.155
Can I tell you something?

15:30.030 --> 15:32.397
Come closer.

15:32.399 --> 15:36.434
This is, personal.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.202
Private.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.716
You know,

15:51.718 --> 15:54.085
this has only been

15:54.087 --> 15:58.189
about you and me.

15:58.191 --> 16:02.226
It's only ever been
about you and me.

16:02.228 --> 16:05.196
And there's one thing
I know for certain:

16:05.198 --> 16:08.232
That I will never rest

16:08.234 --> 16:10.201
until my son,

16:10.203 --> 16:12.303
who you killed,

16:12.305 --> 16:14.205
is avenged.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.442
And you cannot...

16:17.444 --> 16:19.510
You will not...

16:19.512 --> 16:24.248
Let go of the need
to avenge your sister.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.285
You know,

16:27.287 --> 16:30.388
when I fired the first bullet,

16:30.390 --> 16:34.359
she looked at me, confused.

16:34.361 --> 16:38.162
Like I was some random
man with a gun.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.698
So I told her,

16:40.700 --> 16:44.102
"this is for your brother.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.304
And his sins."

16:48.241 --> 16:51.676
and in that moment...

16:51.678 --> 16:54.245
<i>She understood.</i>

16:57.751 --> 16:59.751
I could see it in her eyes.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.521
So then I fired
the second bullet.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.662
You're a coward.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.330
You failed her, Bryan.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.266
How does that feel?

17:21.540 --> 17:25.309
Your life ended
the moment you took hers.

17:27.646 --> 17:32.617
You will always be my prisoner.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.572
- Agent salt.
- Keep your voice down.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.207
Thanks for meeting me.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.208
You found the problem?

17:57.210 --> 18:00.078
Yeah. Me.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.179
What do you mean?

18:01.181 --> 18:03.614
I have vital information
for you.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.554
My husband's been taken.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.489
They want me to divert
mejia to an airstrip.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.124
They're going to fly him out.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.293
If I don't, they're going
to kill my husband.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.161
You know they will.
You got to go to martello-

18:17.163 --> 18:19.097
- no.
They'll be watching for that.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.598
Well, they're gonna be
watching me too.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.533
That's why I put
distance between us.

18:24.571 --> 18:27.605
You could have gone to hart,
or anyone.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.240
Why come to me?

18:29.242 --> 18:31.309
Because you know.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.578
You know who we're dealing with.

18:35.815 --> 18:39.584
Yeah.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.686
I know.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.824
Please get my husband back.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.537
<i>They want salt to divert
mejia to an airstrip.</i>

18:59.539 --> 19:01.539
<i>They're gonna fly him out
at 1400 hours.</i>

19:01.541 --> 19:04.442
<i>If we abort the transport,
salt's husband dies.</i>

19:04.444 --> 19:06.777
Letting it continue,
it's a big risk.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.379
There's not a lot of upside.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.181
She's a decorated agent.

19:10.183 --> 19:11.883
She's dedicated her life
to the bureau.

19:11.885 --> 19:14.218
Mejia's capture cost
hundreds of lives,

19:14.220 --> 19:15.653
and thousands of man hours.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.688
We put him out there,
we risk losing it all.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.491
Okay, no one's personal
situation can justify that.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.193
We know what their plan is.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.728
So we let salt keep going
with it.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.897
We make the cartel believe
everything's going their way.

19:25.899 --> 19:28.499
Escort mejia right up to the
hand-over if we have to.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.234
<i>And in the meantime,
we look for George.</i>

19:30.236 --> 19:32.270
<i>The minute we grab him,
we pull out mejia.</i>

19:32.272 --> 19:34.272
John, you want to chime in here?

19:34.274 --> 19:38.342
<i>I agree with Bryan.
That's why I'm standing here.</i>

19:40.913 --> 19:42.713
You're on mejia
with Dave and rem.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.515
Do not let him
out of your sight.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.485
<i>Bryan and Scott, the two of you
go find George salt.</i>

19:47.487 --> 19:49.320
When does the cartel
plane touch down?

19:49.322 --> 19:51.222
<i>Six hours.</i>

20:17.249 --> 20:19.283
Listen up, everyone.

20:19.285 --> 20:22.286
Our odni friends and I are in
the Van with mejia.

20:22.288 --> 20:23.754
FBI team will be
in the follow vehicle...

20:23.756 --> 20:25.323
whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.325
I thought FBI was taking mejia.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.328
No, I want you guys focused on
possible external threats.

20:30.330 --> 20:33.264
Let them do the babysitting.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.268
You're supposed to be
lead on this.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.803
Don't let them push you around.

20:38.805 --> 20:42.240
They're not.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.674
You ready?

20:49.549 --> 20:50.948
Come on, let's go.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.654
Come on.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.498
apparently George salt
left for work

21:07.500 --> 21:09.533
early yesterday morning
for an emergency meeting,

21:09.535 --> 21:11.736
some kind of technical issue.
We accessed his cell.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.771
Im from Bob landers,
company vice president,

21:13.773 --> 21:15.940
asked to meet him at 7:00 A.M.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.809
Landers and George salt.
Both fellow mit grads.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.845
No priors,
no history of conflict

21:20.847 --> 21:22.380
in their texts or emails.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.581
In other words, nothing there.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.815
What about the kidnappers?

21:24.817 --> 21:26.884
A couple of witnesses
caught a Van

21:26.886 --> 21:29.520
parked in the parking garage
around 6:25.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.989
Security camera caught this,
but that's it.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.425
Zero on the driver,
or the vehicle.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.627
Okay, so this was
a textbook takedown.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.062
They knew exactly where
the security camera was

21:38.064 --> 21:39.497
and where George salt would be.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.998
We traced the call salt got.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.833
- Burner phones.
- This guy Bob.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.636
What time did he get
to the office?

21:45.638 --> 21:47.772
- 7:20.
- 20 minutes late.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.473
For an emergency?

21:49.475 --> 21:51.442
Bob landers set him up.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.589
Hi, I'm here to see Bob landers.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.825
He's in a staff meeting
right now.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.096
He's on the move.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.764
Have a nice day.

22:18.371 --> 22:20.104
We know you set up George salt.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.973
Got him to work early for
a meeting that didn't exist.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.343
Listen, they said if people
start to ask questions,

22:25.345 --> 22:27.812
not to say anything, and if I
did, they would kill me.

22:27.814 --> 22:30.915
And George.
Please, they're watching.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.049
- Who?
- I don't know exactly,

22:32.051 --> 22:33.751
but they are.

22:33.753 --> 22:34.785
No one's seen you here.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.754
Look, you don't understand...

22:36.756 --> 22:39.824
look, we got to move fast
before someone does see you.

22:39.826 --> 22:40.991
Where's your car?

22:40.993 --> 22:43.094
It's in the lot down the street.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.598
Okay.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.500
You're gonna walk there. Calm.

22:49.502 --> 22:50.935
Like you're going to a meeting.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.937
Gonna drive to
1220 summer street.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.672
Park on level four.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.607
We'll be there.

22:56.609 --> 22:59.076
We'd bring you in now, but if
they see you with us,

22:59.078 --> 23:01.779
it'll be bad for George.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.649
Get walking.

23:07.820 --> 23:08.986
Easy.

23:18.563 --> 23:20.030
- Whoa...
- Just come quietly.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.499
I told you not to talk to them.

23:21.501 --> 23:22.781
I didn't say anything, I swear.

23:28.006 --> 23:29.473
Federal agent.

23:29.475 --> 23:30.608
Drop your weapon.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.077
- Back off.
- Let him go.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.521
Zero, this is Victor.
Suspect down.

23:43.523 --> 23:46.824
Shooter is in a black SUV.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.460
<i>Heading west on patton.</i>

23:49.462 --> 23:50.594
<i>And the suspect?</i>

23:52.565 --> 23:53.964
Suspect's dead.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.066
Dead.

24:11.184 --> 24:13.484
<i>- Riley.
- I need you to access a phone.</i>

24:13.486 --> 24:16.487
<i>GPS locate the last
ten numbers called.</i>

24:16.489 --> 24:19.056
<i>Texting the number now.</i>

24:31.838 --> 24:33.037
This is hart.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.139
<i>Any news?</i>

24:35.141 --> 24:37.675
Working on some leads.

24:37.677 --> 24:40.678
Anything else?
Possible location?

24:40.680 --> 24:44.114
No.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.784
<i>Not yet.</i>

24:47.686 --> 24:48.886
You there?

24:48.888 --> 24:51.655
Yeah, yeah.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.257
You'll be approaching
the diversion point

24:53.259 --> 24:56.227
in less than five minutes.

24:56.229 --> 24:58.596
You ready?

25:03.001 --> 25:05.769
Have you...

25:05.771 --> 25:07.738
Have you ever thought about

25:07.740 --> 25:12.510
never seeing the only person
you'd ever really loved again?

25:14.779 --> 25:18.983
<i>Marie, we're playing every
angle here to find George.</i>

25:18.985 --> 25:22.052
We're doing everything we can.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.721
Okay.

25:23.723 --> 25:26.557
<i>Diversion point any minute
now, copy that.</i>

25:47.712 --> 25:49.680
<i>- This is salt.
- You told them.</i>

25:49.682 --> 25:51.916
<i>Your instructions
were to tell no one.</i>

25:51.918 --> 25:53.984
<i>Look at your screen.</i>

26:00.259 --> 26:01.825
<i>Marie, what's happening?</i>

26:01.827 --> 26:03.060
<i>Help me!</i>

26:03.062 --> 26:04.828
<i>You got to help...</i>

26:11.103 --> 26:12.102
mills, you find anything?

26:12.104 --> 26:13.604
<i>I lost a suspect.</i>

26:13.606 --> 26:14.872
<i>They killed him
before we could...</i>

26:14.874 --> 26:16.607
I should never have trusted you.

26:16.609 --> 26:18.909
Salt? What?

26:18.911 --> 26:21.312
About you.
They're gonna kill him.

26:21.314 --> 26:23.280
Not while you have mejia.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.583
<i>You promised, you promised
you wouldn't tell anyone.</i>

26:25.585 --> 26:27.151
What the hell have you done?

26:27.153 --> 26:29.653
We're getting somewhere.
You have to trust me.

26:29.655 --> 26:31.288
He's gonna die, isn't he?

26:31.290 --> 26:33.190
I am the only chance you've got.

26:33.192 --> 26:36.226
If he dies, I...
I don't think I...

26:36.228 --> 26:38.596
I'm not gonna let that happen.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.230
<i>But we don't have a lot of time.</i>

26:40.232 --> 26:42.299
<i>So I got to go now.</i>

26:49.308 --> 26:51.609
Riley GPS-ed the last ten
numbers called

26:51.611 --> 26:53.177
on that dead guy's phone.
Seven of them went

26:53.179 --> 26:54.778
to a phone in a mall
in Arlington.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.647
Never gonna bring him to a mall.

26:56.649 --> 26:58.182
There's too many people.
There's too many cameras.

26:58.184 --> 26:59.817
Not this one.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.619
Never got their zoning
approved by the city.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.087
Still an old warehouse.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.060
They're coming up to
the diversion point now.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.196
Zoom in on the tracker.

27:26.044 --> 27:27.277
<i>Follow vehicle down.</i>

27:27.279 --> 27:28.946
<i>Follow vehicle is down.</i>

27:28.948 --> 27:30.247
<i>Something's not right here.</i>

27:30.249 --> 27:32.149
Go, Dave and I will cover mejia.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.185
Let's go.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.087
You okay?

27:37.089 --> 27:38.856
Yeah. Is anybody hurt?

27:38.858 --> 27:40.724
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.893
The steering locked up.
The thing veered off the road.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.395
- Can you get it started?
- No, it's shut down.

27:44.397 --> 27:46.296
It's not going anywhere.

27:46.298 --> 27:49.166
I'm calling martello.
We're on radio silence-

27:49.168 --> 27:51.435
<i>- he's right, we don't want
to give away our position.</i>

27:51.437 --> 27:53.070
I think you really need
to talk to him.

27:53.072 --> 27:55.172
- Just to play it safe.
- Jenkins.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.408
Let me handle martello.

27:57.410 --> 27:59.410
<i>You come with me.
The rest of you, stay here,</i>

27:59.412 --> 28:01.712
<i>and wait for a recovery vehicle.</i>

28:05.151 --> 28:06.917
Entering suspect location.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.152
<i>Stand by.</i>

28:08.154 --> 28:10.120
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.927
- Whoa.
- Cuff him.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.729
Marie, what are you doing?

28:18.731 --> 28:21.365
I'm sorry.
The cartel has George.

28:21.367 --> 28:24.902
And I need to take you out of
play for your own good.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.037
Make sure those other guys
don't make any calls.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.973
Jenkins is gonna ride
in the Van with us.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.420
Exfil point's up here.

28:43.422 --> 28:46.857
- Plane's 15 minutes out.
- 16.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.192
I just picked up the plane.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.793
You need to see this.

28:49.795 --> 28:51.361
Tail winds pushed up the eta.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.297
The plane will
touch down in six.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.099
Get me bravo.

29:05.111 --> 29:07.010
<i>- Yeah?
- You've got three minutes,</i>

29:07.012 --> 29:08.412
and I'm pulling mejia,

29:08.414 --> 29:10.247
<i>calling the whole thing off...
no.</i>

29:10.249 --> 29:11.915
<i>We're at the location.</i>

29:11.917 --> 29:13.817
Situation just changed.

29:13.819 --> 29:15.786
<i>Three minutes is all you have
left, Bryan.</i>

29:15.788 --> 29:17.387
Okay. Wait out.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.315
Zero, this is Alpha.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.384
<i>Arriving at
the landing strip now.</i>

30:02.801 --> 30:04.334
Roger. Copy.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.570
You love your husband very much.

30:06.572 --> 30:09.139
- Right?
- Don't talk to me.

30:14.046 --> 30:17.948
The only one who can
save him is me.

30:17.950 --> 30:20.818
Get me on the plane,
and you'll see him again.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.253
You can... i give you my word.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.292
Yeah.

30:28.294 --> 30:31.528
Copy that. Stand by.

30:31.530 --> 30:34.164
Hart. She's pulling mejia.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.465
No, no. You can't.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.000
The plane's landing
in four minutes.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.602
Okay, get me hart.
We'll meet them at...

30:38.604 --> 30:41.972
- They'll see through that.
- We've got to try.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.841
They'll negotiate.
We can't lose him.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.976
My husband's a good man.
You can't do this.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.945
George is gonna die.
They see this is a con.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.446
They're gonna kill him.
We got to go.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.915
It's not just him at risk.
It's you too.

30:51.917 --> 30:56.620
And, by the way, the FBI,
so let's get real here.

30:56.622 --> 30:59.356
I'm not going to give up
on my husband.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.491
Salt, at the end of the day,
you're a federal agent.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.560
We do not negotiate with
terrorists,

31:03.562 --> 31:05.863
and I'm sorry,
but you know that.

31:14.405 --> 31:17.507
Aborting now.

31:18.576 --> 31:20.244
Pack it up.

31:35.093 --> 31:38.095
Do not let your husband
die for them.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.345
It's time to move.

31:55.347 --> 31:58.415
Salt, get in the Van now.

32:00.318 --> 32:02.119
I'm going to go get
George myself.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.688
Salt, stop.
Think about what you're doing.

32:10.930 --> 32:13.130
Line her up.

32:23.175 --> 32:24.474
She's a federal agent.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.176
<i>It's salt. She's got mejia.</i>

32:26.178 --> 32:27.511
We have a situation.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.947
I want mejia alive at all costs.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.683
Everyone else is expendable.

32:59.243 --> 33:03.714
Give me back my husband,
or I will take him down.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.576
Give me back my husband!

33:32.578 --> 33:35.045
Or I will take him down.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.448
If you think I won't do it,
I will.

33:54.465 --> 33:58.068
Drop it.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.603
Give us mejia!

33:59.605 --> 34:01.538
Or we'll put a bullet
in your husband's head.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.340
Right now!

34:05.744 --> 34:07.277
I said drop it.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.587
Zero, bravo.
We have the hostage.

34:17.589 --> 34:21.190
We have the hostage.

34:23.262 --> 34:24.694
<i>George. We have him.</i>

34:24.696 --> 34:27.197
He's safe.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.099
- He's alive!
- You believe that?

34:29.101 --> 34:30.500
They always lie.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.235
He's got him. Trust me.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.371
Salt, your husband is safe.

34:34.373 --> 34:37.274
Ask him!

34:37.275 --> 34:40.476
Ask him what we had for dinner
at our wedding.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.484
You didn't have a wedding.
You eloped.

34:48.654 --> 34:51.288
Fried clams at the beach!

35:07.673 --> 35:09.106
Salt.

35:09.108 --> 35:11.241
I got you. I got you.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.347
Mejia. Where is he?

35:24.522 --> 35:26.223
My wife. I want to talk to her.

35:26.225 --> 35:27.624
- Is she okay?
- Yes.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.226
You're a lucky man.

35:34.499 --> 35:36.800
Mills.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.668
Mejia's gone.

35:42.374 --> 35:44.541
Get me a helo.

35:58.157 --> 35:59.589
<i>Doctor says six weeks.</i>

35:59.591 --> 36:01.892
<i>Finally get to spend
some time at home.</i>

36:01.894 --> 36:03.527
Me too.

36:03.529 --> 36:06.663
Yeah, they're probably
gonna suspend me.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.532
<i>- Sorry.
- I'm not.</i>

36:08.534 --> 36:10.734
It's going to be just us now.

36:13.906 --> 36:16.473
<i>I love you. - Love you too.</i>

36:16.475 --> 36:18.341
I got to go.

36:18.343 --> 36:21.278
Mills.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.879
I just wanted... I need a truck.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.648
- What's going on?
- Right now.

36:27.386 --> 36:30.820
Donnie, get me a vehicle.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.289
How do you know where he is?

36:32.291 --> 36:33.757
Tracker.

36:36.595 --> 36:39.796
I want him to die.

36:39.798 --> 36:41.198
I know.

36:49.607 --> 36:52.876
<i>Please be advised,
suspect is armed and dangerous.</i>

36:52.878 --> 36:54.778
<i>Maintain coordinate positions
as key locations</i>

36:54.780 --> 36:57.247
<i>until further notice.</i>

36:57.249 --> 36:59.482
<i>Maintain a state of high alert.</i>

36:59.484 --> 37:01.318
<i>High alert.</i>

37:03.722 --> 37:05.455
Got the results
on that phone record.

37:05.457 --> 37:06.623
Please tell me there's something

37:06.625 --> 37:07.958
that leads us to mejia.

37:07.960 --> 37:08.959
Possibly.

37:08.961 --> 37:10.493
Elena morales.

37:10.495 --> 37:11.928
She grew up in Mexico.

37:11.930 --> 37:16.366
San cristóbal de las casas.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.835
Same town as mejia.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.303
Get me an address.

37:20.305 --> 37:23.340
26 tivoli college park.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.709
Hi. Got your rug.

37:25.711 --> 37:26.977
Where do you want it?

37:26.979 --> 37:29.279
You must have the wrong address.

37:29.281 --> 37:31.281
No, I've got 28 tivoli.

37:31.283 --> 37:34.017
Yes, but that's not my-!

37:52.637 --> 37:53.703
Elena!

38:22.868 --> 38:25.335
Hands.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.907
Get out.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.683
<i>At the residence now...</i>

38:40.752 --> 38:42.018
What's going on, officer?

38:42.020 --> 38:43.453
Neighbors heard
a woman screaming.

38:43.455 --> 38:46.990
Looks like some kind of fight.

38:50.895 --> 38:53.363
My god.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.734
I'm gonna go check out
number 26.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.069
Call this in.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.478
Where are we going?

39:08.480 --> 39:10.947
Federal prison.

39:10.949 --> 39:13.683
Taking you myself.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.785
You ever think about
those who you killed?

39:15.787 --> 39:21.424
Like my son? Or is that too many
for you to remember?

39:21.426 --> 39:23.860
I think about my sister.

39:32.003 --> 39:34.137
You might want to answer that.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.077
Or not.

39:47.718 --> 39:48.818
Mills.

39:48.820 --> 39:49.986
<i>Bryan?</i>

39:49.988 --> 39:51.755
<i>Help me.</i>

39:53.458 --> 39:55.024
<i>Help me...</i>

40:10.475 --> 40:13.476
If she dies, you die.

40:13.478 --> 40:17.714
I die, and I get to see my son.

40:17.716 --> 40:20.150
Call them off.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.632
You...

40:35.634 --> 40:38.067
You really want to see her
die too?

40:39.703 --> 40:42.539
If I let you go,

40:42.541 --> 40:44.073
she dies anyway.

40:44.075 --> 40:46.643
I see how you
could think that way.

40:46.645 --> 40:50.847
How my death means more to you
than her life.

40:50.849 --> 40:53.650
But so long as I live,
she lives.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.885
She's my new insurance policy.

41:10.201 --> 41:13.837
Take your phone back.
You're going to need it.

41:16.574 --> 41:18.007
Talk soon.
