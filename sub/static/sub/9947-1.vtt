00:01.200 --> 00:04.078
Anyone watching
thinking we know fuck all

00:04.080 --> 00:08.079
about knowing fuck all about owt,
needs to watch their back.

00:08.560 --> 00:11.679
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:11.680 --> 00:13.439
sending prices sky-high,

00:13.440 --> 00:17.439
literally, literally
taking the grass from its own roots!

00:18.000 --> 00:20.159
Now you've got your Con-Dem-Nation,

00:20.160 --> 00:23.559
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking DIMPs up!

00:23.560 --> 00:27.399
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:27.400 --> 00:31.319
Is revolution a word
or was it never?

00:31.320 --> 00:33.799
Anybody watching needs to know

00:33.800 --> 00:37.079
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:37.080 --> 00:40.559
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester,

00:40.560 --> 00:43.319
and they charge us for water?

00:43.320 --> 00:47.319
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.839
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.439
Yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak!

00:54.440 --> 00:57.719
It's not theirs any more.

00:57.720 --> 01:00.759
This is our England now!

01:00.760 --> 01:04.759
Paaaarty!

Cogito ergo sum.

01:15.680 --> 01:19.679
Pardon my French,
well Latin, actually.

01:19.800 --> 01:23.679
The English is
"I think therefore I am",

01:23.680 --> 01:27.679
a phrase captured by some
snail-chewer called Rene Descartes.

01:30.440 --> 01:34.439
Essentially, it means that because
you're capable of logical thought,

01:36.240 --> 01:40.239
you are aware of your existence.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.719
But by the same method,

01:42.720 --> 01:46.639
you haven't got the foggiest
what's going on in my head,

01:46.640 --> 01:50.239
so there's no real way
of knowing I definitely exist.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.919
I could be a figment
of your imagination,

01:53.920 --> 01:57.919
me and everything,
y'know, everyone in your world.

What, a stag night?

04:21.959 --> 04:25.599
If I wanted an evening of ritual
humiliation, I'd stay at home.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.479
Are you sure you want to go
through with this wedding?

04:27.480 --> 04:29.799
You won't catch me getting married again.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.519
I'm not going to stay and
have my private life dissected

04:33.520 --> 04:35.199
and judged by the likes of you.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.199
Same again, Jamie. My round, lads.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.399
Cos I don't know how
I can even begin to explain

04:45.960 --> 04:49.679
what it is that
me and Libby have got precisely.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.679
Er... Try.

04:56.120 --> 05:00.119
Well, starters, we're in love.

05:02.240 --> 05:05.479
Just because you've never had
the love of a good man!

05:05.480 --> 05:08.799
The only things Frank loves come
with a Government health warning.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.799
We're soulmates!

05:14.480 --> 05:16.799
Her soul, my soul.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.199
Arseholes!

05:17.200 --> 05:18.359
Arseholes!
Well said, sweet pea.

05:18.360 --> 05:22.359
I don't need a ring on me finger
or a blessing from fuck knows who,

05:22.400 --> 05:25.199
but she does.
She's happy, I'm happy.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.519
OK, he's not perfect,
but who the bloody hell is!?

05:28.520 --> 05:30.799
I'm not far off.
A few minor blemishes but...

05:30.800 --> 05:32.599
This is no time for jokes!

05:32.600 --> 05:33.599
Who's joking?

05:33.600 --> 05:36.639
Any wonder she's been on the shelf as
long as she has with that attitude?

05:36.640 --> 05:37.719
When I were her age,

05:37.720 --> 05:40.319
men were falling over themselves
to get to me.

05:40.320 --> 05:44.319
Falling over their
fuckin' guide dogs.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.279
We were just pulling your leg.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.079
That's what I was just saying.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.919
Frank's altered
since they've been together.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.159
Often hear him in the pub
talking about you.

05:55.160 --> 05:59.159
People saying
they've never seen him so happy.

05:59.160 --> 06:03.159
The cause of all the trouble
in all the world

06:03.680 --> 06:05.639
since the dawn of time,

06:05.640 --> 06:07.679
can be traced right back

06:07.680 --> 06:11.119
via one singular route to...

06:11.120 --> 06:12.719
the moustache!

06:12.720 --> 06:16.519
Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Mandelson...

06:16.520 --> 06:20.519
Down you go!

06:21.040 --> 06:25.039
Freddie Mercury!

06:26.560 --> 06:28.239
I'm not stupid.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.479
I'm aware of his shortcomings

06:30.480 --> 06:34.479
and I'm going into this
with my eyes open.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.999
Well, if only you'd set
your sights a little higher.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.679
And the cupboard was bare.
Right, girls, pub.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.839
I'll be over as soon as Liam shows.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.599
Oh, should've asked Mickey to
keep an eye on her. He's got Cilla.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.319
Just as easy to look
after two kids as it is one.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.799
How the fuck would you know?

06:54.800 --> 06:57.879
You're sticking with the name then?
Cilla. Are you a fan?

06:57.880 --> 07:00.028
Step Inside Love was a great song.

07:00.270 --> 07:01.999
Is it a Liverpoodlian thing?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.879
But I always preferred Lulu.
That thing she did with her accent.

07:05.880 --> 07:09.879
Scottish one minute,
English the next. Such talent.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.679
It's got nothing to do
with being Scouse, Lillian,

07:15.680 --> 07:17.599
and everything to do with the birth

07:17.600 --> 07:19.679
being one fuck
of a Surprise Surprise.

07:19.680 --> 07:20.999
Cilla Maguire, then?

07:21.000 --> 07:21.931
Stop fishing.

07:21.965 --> 07:23.717
Come on, Mimi, who's the daddy?

07:24.360 --> 07:27.079
You really do want
your face rearranging, don't you?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.919
Hm.

07:28.920 --> 07:32.919
Who could blame her? Later, Libs.

07:41.960 --> 07:45.759
Hiya, Avril.

07:45.760 --> 07:49.759
Is everything all right?

07:50.840 --> 07:54.079
Letitia! Letitia!

07:54.080 --> 07:55.799
Your father's here.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.199
He's at football.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.919
Goalie got a groin strain,
match was cancelled.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.959
Why didn't you get changed?

08:01.960 --> 08:04.239
If your father finds out I've sent
you to private school

08:04.240 --> 08:06.159
he'll kill me! I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up!

08:06.160 --> 08:07.799
Once you're in uni, it's all over.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.319
Once you're in uni, it's all over.
I might not even get into uni.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.079
You better bloody had.

08:11.080 --> 08:14.879
The amount I've spent
sending you to that place.

08:14.880 --> 08:20.168
I want the lot. GCSEs, A-levels
and a first class degree.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.228
Liam's asked if she can give him
a hand with his homework again.

08:26.244 --> 08:27.599
Should bring him in here.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.599
He doesn't like anyone
knowing he's struggling.

08:39.400 --> 08:43.399
Put the lock on.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.719
This do ya?

08:50.720 --> 08:54.719
Mm! Yes!

08:57.040 --> 08:58.079
Ah! Ah-ha!

08:58.080 --> 09:02.079
Too soon! Too soon!

09:02.360 --> 09:05.079
You like it like that, eh?

09:05.080 --> 09:09.079
You want a bit of that?

09:10.280 --> 09:14.039
Agh!

09:14.040 --> 09:15.679
Yeah!

09:15.680 --> 09:19.679
Aghh!

09:30.200 --> 09:32.079
Go to mummy.

09:32.080 --> 09:36.079
Look after the baby
a bit longer will you, son?

09:42.080 --> 09:45.159
Hiya, Stevie. I don't know
if you remember me but...

09:45.160 --> 09:46.439
Mimi?

09:46.440 --> 09:50.439
Phil, I know this sounds weird, and
believe me, all I'm after is answers.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.919
Would it be possible to talk inside?

09:52.920 --> 09:54.439
I don't think
the wife'd be too impressed.

09:54.440 --> 09:58.439
What I need to know is
if you can remember when we...

09:58.840 --> 10:00.199
got together.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.661
I need you to take a blood test.

10:01.711 --> 10:02.453
Shit.

10:02.495 --> 10:03.872
You've not got the AIDS, have you?

10:03.922 --> 10:04.999
Definitely August?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.079
Look, I was pissed.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.999
To see if you're me child's father.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.319
No chance of that, Mimi.
I had the snip 20 years ago.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.719
It was a one night stand
and I'm cool with that.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.239
What was a one night stand?

10:15.240 --> 10:16.239
Shit.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.119
It's not what you think!

10:18.120 --> 10:21.319
What the fuck would you know
about what I think?

10:21.320 --> 10:23.319
She's out tonight.

10:23.320 --> 10:25.879
Ooh. Any chance of a rematch?

10:25.880 --> 10:27.199
I took advantage, honest...

10:27.200 --> 10:28.399
Oh!

10:28.400 --> 10:32.399
Agh!

10:32.560 --> 10:35.639
You bitch!
You've ruined everything!

10:35.640 --> 10:39.639
Mimi?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.119
Can I see your dad, please, Andy?

10:42.120 --> 10:46.119
Sure.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.479
I'm off t'pub.
Planning the wedding.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.679
I'm so excited, I can't tell you.

11:08.680 --> 11:12.239
We're having ice sculptures -
famous Mancunians in literature.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.719
I'm sorry to disturb you.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.959
Is it possible to speak
to Mr Gallagher, please?

11:21.960 --> 11:24.959
Vernon Francis Gallagher?

11:24.960 --> 11:27.039
I'm afraid he's not in
at the moment.

11:27.040 --> 11:31.039
I'm his fiancee, can I help you?

11:34.280 --> 11:38.279
It's about his daughter,
Deborah Gallagher.

11:39.450 --> 11:41.689
So what's all this about?

11:41.690 --> 11:46.409
You might be missing Connor.
I know he's been missing you.

11:46.761 --> 11:48.760
Thought you might want to see him.

11:49.327 --> 11:51.526
So you and Joe?

11:51.527 --> 11:53.538
This is about me and you.

11:55.249 --> 11:56.676
Joe told me Connor was his.

11:57.293 --> 11:58.607
Showed me the DNA results.

11:58.727 --> 12:00.046
Well he called your bluff.

12:00.047 --> 12:04.046
And if you'd have opened the envelope
you'd have seen it was a gas bill.

12:04.647 --> 12:08.446
What's going on? I said I'd kill him and I
meant it so why would he agree to this?

12:08.447 --> 12:10.126
I haven't got time for this.

12:10.127 --> 12:11.166
Offer's on the table.

12:11.167 --> 12:15.006
Call me
when you're thinking straight.

12:15.007 --> 12:16.206
You're dumping Connor.

12:16.207 --> 12:17.686
He's found out Connor's mine.

12:17.687 --> 12:20.806
Fucking cuckoo in the nest
and he wants rid.

12:20.807 --> 12:23.246
Wants to play happy families,
have his own kids.

12:23.247 --> 12:25.166
Send you to sweet talk me
so you can offload?

12:25.167 --> 12:29.166
Karen!

12:34.287 --> 12:35.326
Jamie!

12:35.327 --> 12:38.095
I said I'd kill you if I ever saw
you again.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.697
It's not him!

12:39.817 --> 12:42.485
It's not him!

12:49.047 --> 12:52.366
Oh, it's not another fucking
Dr Who convention, is it, Lillian?

12:52.367 --> 12:54.046
No, why?

12:54.047 --> 12:58.046
It's just, after tickets...

13:01.047 --> 13:04.126
Can't get a minute's peace,
what is it?

13:04.127 --> 13:05.326
I'm sorry.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.606
I'm so, so sorry.

13:07.607 --> 13:11.606
All I'm after is a quiet fucking
pint with the lads and in she walks.

13:14.007 --> 13:17.486
It's Debbie.

13:17.487 --> 13:21.486
She's been killed in Afghanistan.

13:47.047 --> 13:49.166
Fucking rag-heads.

13:49.167 --> 13:52.126
If you need anything, Frank.

13:52.127 --> 13:56.126
You could chuck us 40 fags
until the giro hits my account.

13:58.847 --> 14:01.606
Just need to anaesthetise.

14:01.607 --> 14:02.846
Cheers.

14:02.847 --> 14:04.726
No credit.

14:04.727 --> 14:05.806
Leave it!

14:05.807 --> 14:08.126
You're haemorrhaging profit left,
right and centre and this is why.

14:08.127 --> 14:09.886
He's just lost his daughter.

14:09.887 --> 14:12.286
And our family will lose this shop
if you carry on like this.

14:12.287 --> 14:13.446
Name?

14:13.447 --> 14:14.926
Frank Gallagher.

14:14.927 --> 14:17.806
Frank "32.85 outstanding on your
slate" Gallagher.

14:17.807 --> 14:21.206
Frank, "my daughter died defending Queen
and country for the likes of you"

14:21.207 --> 14:24.286
Gallagher's got a better ring
to it. But yeah.

14:24.287 --> 14:25.766
You're bang out of order, Sita.

14:25.767 --> 14:29.766
You know what, don't even worry
about it, mate.

14:33.487 --> 14:35.806
I'll take over here.

14:35.807 --> 14:37.046
I'm fine.

14:37.047 --> 14:39.206
I know for a fact you
haven't slept a wink.

14:39.207 --> 14:42.126
Looking after Liam,
Carl, Frank.

14:42.127 --> 14:46.126
Let me look after you.

14:48.247 --> 14:50.366
Beans on toast do you?

14:50.367 --> 14:51.486
We've nothing in.

14:51.487 --> 14:53.806
I'm not that hungry.

14:53.807 --> 14:55.446
You've not had any breakfast.

14:55.447 --> 14:56.726
You've got to eat something.

14:56.727 --> 14:58.326
I'll go round the shop.

14:58.327 --> 14:59.886
Liam?

15:16.447 --> 15:20.446
It's OK, your mum's here.

15:21.407 --> 15:23.806
Liam. Carl.

15:23.807 --> 15:25.926
Monica?

15:25.927 --> 15:29.926
Oh, oh, oh!

15:31.007 --> 15:33.366
Frank, our little girl.

15:33.367 --> 15:37.366
Don't worry. I'm here now.

15:38.927 --> 15:40.966
I don't know what came over me.

15:40.967 --> 15:42.806
I'm not the fainting type.

15:42.807 --> 15:45.486
It's the shock. You've suffered a
terrible loss.

15:45.487 --> 15:48.326
And you're God knows how many
months up the spout.

15:48.327 --> 15:52.326
My children need me. You need me.

15:55.207 --> 15:59.206
Could you give us...
a few moments in private?

16:02.487 --> 16:06.486
Oh, of course. Sorry.

16:11.647 --> 16:13.366
Have you heard from Carl?

16:13.367 --> 16:17.366
Texted him. Not heard back yet,
I think he's best left.

16:18.607 --> 16:19.726
What are you doing here?

16:19.727 --> 16:22.566
Saving you from yourself.

16:22.567 --> 16:26.566
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
serve him with alcohol again.

16:26.647 --> 16:27.686
Bird?

16:27.687 --> 16:28.886
Cousin.

16:28.887 --> 16:31.766
Sita, I told grandad,
I don't need his help.

16:31.767 --> 16:33.686
So you reject
his help but accept his money?

16:33.687 --> 16:34.886
Back off.

16:34.887 --> 16:38.886
As soon as you prove you can behave like the
good Muslim boy I know you to be, I will.

16:52.527 --> 16:55.686
I'll top and tail with Mum.

16:55.687 --> 16:57.166
Frank can take the couch.

16:57.167 --> 16:59.726
Can't have you
cramped in your condition.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.566
Six weeks to go. I can't wait.

17:01.567 --> 17:03.246
A little bundle of love.

17:03.247 --> 17:06.526
Oh, that big bundle of cash.
I'm a surrogate

17:06.527 --> 17:08.925
for a gay couple in Oldham
who've got everything

17:08.926 --> 17:10.606
they could possibly want, bar kids.

17:10.607 --> 17:12.406
You're going to give it away?

17:12.406 --> 17:15.766
Oh no, I get 18K. For him. Ricky
Martin.

17:15.767 --> 17:19.766
I haven't formed an emotional
attachment. You got kids?

17:20.207 --> 17:21.646
The timing was never right.

17:21.646 --> 17:24.366
You didn't find a man until
Mother Nature withdrew her favours.

17:24.367 --> 17:26.326
Aw! Career woman?

17:26.327 --> 17:27.925
Librarian.

17:27.926 --> 17:30.846
Hardly worth it, was it?

17:30.847 --> 17:32.886
Where did you meet?

17:33.640 --> 17:39.423
It was in the poetry section, reading Byron,
Wordsworth, "I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud".

17:39.543 --> 17:41.173
In a cloud if I know Frank.

17:41.215 --> 17:42.274
We had an immediate attraction.

17:42.299 --> 17:43.510
Oh yeah, we had one of them.

17:43.543 --> 17:46.672
I got knocked up in the gents
in the Wigan Casino all-nighter.

17:46.722 --> 17:50.046
That's where we made little Fifi.
Fiona.

17:50.047 --> 17:51.526
Oh.

17:51.527 --> 17:55.446
It's supposed to be in three weeks.
I really don't see how we can go ahead.

17:55.447 --> 17:58.606
Oh, but it's exactly what
Debbie would have wanted.

17:58.607 --> 18:00.326
New beginnings.

18:00.327 --> 18:03.286
Oh, you must go ahead.

18:03.287 --> 18:04.326
I don't think Frank...

18:04.327 --> 18:08.326
I know how to get around Frank.
You leave him to me.

18:19.207 --> 18:22.446
Usual, Monica?

18:22.447 --> 18:24.846
What, in my State?

18:24.847 --> 18:28.846
Just a single.

18:29.767 --> 18:31.846
Oh.

18:31.847 --> 18:34.566
Debbie would have loved that.

18:34.567 --> 18:37.966
Except for the flowers.
She weren't big on lilies.

18:37.967 --> 18:40.886
On the house. Sorry for your loss.

18:40.887 --> 18:44.886
Thanks, Jamie.

18:51.607 --> 18:55.086
To Debbie.

19:05.167 --> 19:09.166
It's...our little girl.
It's our Debbie.

19:11.647 --> 19:15.646
Please, Frank, don't.

19:16.287 --> 19:20.286
We had a whip-round.
The wake's on us. Food, booze.

19:21.687 --> 19:25.686
Oh, man, that's such a comfort.

19:27.407 --> 19:29.846
Debbie wouldn't have
wanted this.

19:29.847 --> 19:33.846
All these miserable faces.

19:34.687 --> 19:37.526
Let's celebrate her life, eh?

19:40.287 --> 19:41.966
Drinks for everyone.

19:43.087 --> 19:46.206
A toast. For Debbie.

19:46.207 --> 19:48.726
It's not like we can't afford it.

19:48.727 --> 19:52.726
I've got some cash coming my way.

19:58.007 --> 20:02.006
Cilla's out like a light.

20:04.487 --> 20:08.166
OK?

20:08.167 --> 20:09.246
Feel like shit.

20:09.247 --> 20:11.286
Exhausted with it all.

20:11.287 --> 20:13.886
Mam, don't be embarrassed.

20:13.887 --> 20:16.766
When me and your dad separated
I did anything

20:16.767 --> 20:19.566
and everything to get some
sense of self-worth.

20:19.567 --> 20:23.566
To prove to myself that
I was still attractive.

20:23.687 --> 20:27.686
Desirable.

20:29.807 --> 20:32.206
Well I think you're lovely.

20:32.207 --> 20:34.526
Even in the light.

20:34.527 --> 20:37.126
A beauty all your own.

20:37.127 --> 20:40.206
Do you think?
Yeah.

20:40.207 --> 20:44.206
And once you get past the accent
and that you always reminded me

20:44.487 --> 20:45.606
a bit of Dawn French.

20:45.607 --> 20:48.486
Fucking hell, Mickey,
she's twice the size of me.

20:48.487 --> 20:49.886
But gorgeous.

20:49.887 --> 20:53.886
When Cilla asks me who her dad
is I want to be able to tell her.

20:54.847 --> 20:58.846
I want to look her in the eye
and give her his name.

21:00.647 --> 21:03.566
Must think I'm some kind of slut.

21:03.567 --> 21:05.966
Mam.

21:05.967 --> 21:07.966
I'm a 21st century type of guy.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.646
I've probably slept with more
than that on a busy weekend.

21:10.647 --> 21:12.966
You know, birds, obviously.

21:12.967 --> 21:16.966
Tits and stuff. Flange.

21:29.447 --> 21:33.446
Tell her, Dad was the most
handsome man you'd ever met.

21:34.207 --> 21:37.126
That he was here on a fact-finding
trip from the States.

21:37.127 --> 21:41.126
Something to do with housing policy
under a directive from "Baracks Obama".

21:43.047 --> 21:45.886
And you fell for his manly
charms.

21:45.887 --> 21:49.686
The way his muscles strained against
the pure white cotton of his shirt.

21:49.687 --> 21:53.686
You had one night of love
and Cilla was born from that love.

21:54.087 --> 21:56.926
Months later he found out
you was up the spout.

21:56.927 --> 21:59.406
Was on his way back,
died in a plane crash.

21:59.407 --> 22:01.246
Do you reckon she'll buy that?

22:01.247 --> 22:05.246
Yes.

22:14.967 --> 22:18.966
Silver lining for your black cloud.

22:21.407 --> 22:25.406
♪ Will you ever
know that you're my hero?

22:27.887 --> 22:31.886
♪ Everything I would like to be. ♪

22:32.247 --> 22:33.686
This is just a warm-up.

22:33.687 --> 22:37.686
When we have the real wake, we'll give
our Debbie one hell of a send off.

22:40.047 --> 22:44.046
We'll give her a celebration
she'll never forget.

22:44.087 --> 22:45.486
We'll never forget.

22:45.487 --> 22:46.966
♪ Wings. ♪

22:46.967 --> 22:50.126
What are you having?

22:50.127 --> 22:54.126
Jamie, a drink for the future
Mrs Gallagher.

22:54.127 --> 22:55.406
No, I'm fine thanks.

22:55.407 --> 22:56.686
Are you sure?

22:56.687 --> 22:58.646
Don't worry. He's safe.

22:58.647 --> 23:00.686
It's just that we've got a past,
me and him.

23:00.687 --> 23:02.286
Past.

23:02.287 --> 23:03.766
I gave him
the best years of my life.

23:03.767 --> 23:05.206
Twice!

23:05.207 --> 23:09.206
He's all yours, lovey,
my heart belongs to another.

23:10.807 --> 23:13.126
My civil partner.

23:13.127 --> 23:17.126
I'm gay. Got married in a posh tent
in Devon. Are you shocked?

23:17.567 --> 23:19.206
I was just wondering.

23:19.207 --> 23:23.206
I'm so, so sorry. It's terrible when
your children die before you.

23:23.287 --> 23:24.606
Not nature's way.

23:24.607 --> 23:27.686
You have never lost a kid.

23:27.687 --> 23:30.006
I might as well have lost my Rodney.

23:30.007 --> 23:31.526
For all the use he is.

23:34.007 --> 23:37.646
I was just wondering when you'd be
coming back to the house?

23:37.647 --> 23:40.886
It's Liam. He needs his mum,
he needs you there.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.006
So I'm a bad mother now?

23:43.007 --> 23:45.006
No, no.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.486
Someone who can't even produce

23:47.487 --> 23:50.686
a child of their own calling me
a bad mother.

23:50.687 --> 23:51.846
That's not what I said.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.686
Here's me grieving and she's
telling me I'm a bad mother.

23:54.687 --> 23:56.726
I didn't. I didn't say that.

23:56.727 --> 24:00.726
Fuck sake. Show some sensitivity.

24:01.687 --> 24:04.726
You should be helping
instead of hindering.

24:04.727 --> 24:08.726
It's all right. It's OK.

24:14.847 --> 24:16.166
About before.

24:16.167 --> 24:18.326
The less said from you the better.

24:18.327 --> 24:21.006
You need to lie down.

24:21.007 --> 24:22.526
You're exhausted.

24:22.527 --> 24:24.926
That baby will come out
pie-eyed.

24:24.927 --> 24:27.486
She should be ashamed of herself.

24:27.487 --> 24:31.486
Everyone deals with
grief in different ways.

24:31.607 --> 24:35.606
And getting pissed and moving back
in with her ex is hers, I suppose?

24:35.807 --> 24:39.806
I thought you were
cleverer than that.

24:41.807 --> 24:43.766
Your aura's all wrong.

24:43.767 --> 24:46.286
For a soon to be married man.

24:46.287 --> 24:50.286
Oh, that'll be the small
matter of losing our daughter

24:52.247 --> 24:54.326
Don't grieve, Love.

24:54.327 --> 24:57.246
She's on a higher plane.

24:57.247 --> 25:01.246
I studied under a Reiki
Master in Glastonbury.

25:01.247 --> 25:04.446
Three months in a year.

25:04.447 --> 25:08.446
Your kundalini needs raising.

25:09.967 --> 25:13.966
Your chakras can't
function properly.

25:14.527 --> 25:15.766
Oh, I feel for you.

25:15.767 --> 25:19.766
There is nothing wrong with me
other than the obvious.

25:24.927 --> 25:27.206
Spirits battling.

25:27.207 --> 25:30.006
"Am I doing the right thing?"

25:30.007 --> 25:34.006
If you mean Libby,
I am doing the right thing.

25:38.127 --> 25:39.646
Someone needs to tell Fiona.

25:39.647 --> 25:41.086
Then call her.

25:41.087 --> 25:44.406
It's not something you can do over the phone.
She'll be upset. Need family with her.

25:44.407 --> 25:47.526
She's got a husband.

25:47.527 --> 25:48.846
I'll call you when I get there.

25:48.847 --> 25:51.446
And me and Fiona can drive over
and see Lip.

25:51.447 --> 25:53.766
There's no way I can let you leave.

25:53.767 --> 25:55.246
You can't stop me.

25:55.247 --> 25:59.246
Wait there,
I'll fetch your mum and dad.

26:00.047 --> 26:04.046
Liam's...

26:13.576 --> 26:17.575
Lib.

26:17.856 --> 26:19.855
It wasn't how it looked.

26:19.856 --> 26:22.655
Her on her knees? You with your
trousersround your ankles?!

26:22.656 --> 26:24.535
Libby, she was just trying it on.

26:24.536 --> 26:28.015
You know, Indian head massages.
She was trying to raise me diphthong.

26:28.016 --> 26:32.015
You've got cold feet, been having
second thoughts - it's obvious.

26:32.536 --> 26:36.535
I've been having them ever
since we named the day.

26:37.576 --> 26:40.375
Ah, fuck.

26:40.376 --> 26:42.575
Look, I've been thinking about
me track record

26:42.576 --> 26:45.535
and whether I've got the stamina
for another stab at matrimony,

26:45.536 --> 26:48.255
and the fact that I'm still here
says yes...

26:48.256 --> 26:50.575
says I still want to marry you.

26:50.576 --> 26:51.615
Doesn't it?

26:51.616 --> 26:55.615
I don't know.

26:56.936 --> 26:59.175
Nothing happened!

26:59.176 --> 27:03.175
And if you don't believe that,
let's call the whole thing off.

27:16.056 --> 27:17.335
I owe you an apology.

27:17.336 --> 27:20.335
I was rude, insensitive.

27:20.336 --> 27:24.335
Obviously I didn't know and, erm...

27:24.936 --> 27:28.935
I'm sorry.

27:29.016 --> 27:31.055
Cheers.

27:31.056 --> 27:34.615
How about you buy me
a drink some time?

27:34.616 --> 27:35.655
Make up for it.

27:35.656 --> 27:38.695
I don't drink.

27:38.696 --> 27:40.975
I'm Muslim.

27:40.976 --> 27:43.655
You're not supposed to drink?

27:43.656 --> 27:46.215
What about summat to eat, then?

27:46.216 --> 27:48.015
Muslims eat, don't they?

27:48.016 --> 27:49.375
It's been known.

27:49.376 --> 27:53.375
Chinese buffet in town, all you can
eat for a fiver.

27:59.816 --> 28:01.895
Can't blame a man for trying,
can you, Ches?

28:01.896 --> 28:03.255
Do yourself a favour, mate...

28:03.256 --> 28:04.375
Don't go there.

28:04.376 --> 28:06.175
She's more trouble than she's worth.

28:06.176 --> 28:07.295
You'll never change him.

28:07.296 --> 28:09.775
Two previous wives
failed miserably

28:09.776 --> 28:11.735
and you've got nothing
they weren't equipped with.

28:11.736 --> 28:13.775
It's time to admit defeat.

28:13.776 --> 28:15.440
Surrender.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.783
There's no shame in it.

28:20.016 --> 28:23.535
You want to be with me? Say it!

28:24.426 --> 28:26.776
I want to be with you.

28:30.216 --> 28:32.735
Say it again.

28:32.736 --> 28:36.735
I want to be with you.

28:37.056 --> 28:39.015
I want to marry you.

28:39.016 --> 28:40.322
Prove it.

28:45.576 --> 28:46.855
It's a start.

28:46.856 --> 28:49.695
Anyway, as soon as Milly's
here in the morning, I'll be gone.

28:49.696 --> 28:53.695
Good.

28:53.736 --> 28:57.735
That's my house, you old bitch!

28:59.016 --> 29:01.815
It stopped being your house
when you walked out.

29:01.816 --> 29:03.295
For the second time.

29:03.296 --> 29:05.975
Oh, give it a bloody rest, Liam.

29:05.976 --> 29:09.015
I had to go. This place was
killing me and you know it.

29:09.016 --> 29:10.495
Why did you come back?

29:10.496 --> 29:11.935
For you.

29:11.936 --> 29:12.975
And Carl.

29:12.976 --> 29:14.175
Your sister's dead.

29:14.176 --> 29:15.655
Why did you really come back?

29:15.656 --> 29:17.895
I'm your mother.
Isn't that reason enough?

29:17.896 --> 29:19.295
No.

29:19.296 --> 29:23.295
Anyway what's between your dad
and me is above right and wrong.

29:23.776 --> 29:25.095
No, not now!

29:25.096 --> 29:27.215
Someone's trying to get through.

29:27.216 --> 29:29.055
Away! Away!

29:29.056 --> 29:33.055
Get away from me!

29:52.936 --> 29:54.535
She came to me.

29:54.536 --> 29:57.495
Debbie came to me. She can't rest!

29:57.496 --> 29:59.055
She was holding a dress,

29:59.056 --> 30:03.055
a wedding dress
and she was shaking her head.

30:03.576 --> 30:07.575
Came to you in a dream, as opposed
to you just having a dream?

30:08.216 --> 30:11.095
You won't stifle my spirit
with your cynicism.

30:11.096 --> 30:13.215
I've had visitations in the past,
all proved true.

30:13.216 --> 30:14.695
A coalition government,

30:14.696 --> 30:18.135
collapse of the banking system,
Dannii Minogue's pregnancy.

30:18.136 --> 30:20.455
Her spirit's in torment.

30:20.456 --> 30:24.215
She can't pass over
until she's healed.

30:24.216 --> 30:26.655
Only you can heal her, Frank.

30:26.656 --> 30:29.175
You have the power.

30:34.336 --> 30:38.335
We've got to focus, concentrate.
Can you switch your phones off?

30:38.616 --> 30:39.975
What's going on, Mum?

30:39.976 --> 30:43.975
Just clearing the channels.
She's trying to come through!

30:49.816 --> 30:52.215
It's bad spirits.

30:52.216 --> 30:53.255
Out!

30:53.256 --> 30:55.015
Out!

30:55.016 --> 30:57.895
Out!

31:00.096 --> 31:02.935
She says she's been trying to call you but
there's something wrong with your phones.

31:02.936 --> 31:03.935
Who?

31:03.936 --> 31:07.935
Debbie.

31:08.816 --> 31:12.295
She's alive.

31:12.296 --> 31:16.295
Alive!

31:25.616 --> 31:28.695
Don't be waiting for a wedding
invitation - you won't be invited.

31:28.696 --> 31:32.215
He'll let you down.

31:32.216 --> 31:36.215
Might take months,
might take years...

31:36.376 --> 31:38.975
..probably take weeks.

31:38.976 --> 31:42.975
But he'll let you down.

31:49.936 --> 31:53.255
It was just a joke,
that got out of hand.

31:53.256 --> 31:54.775
You knew what you were doing, Mum.

31:54.776 --> 31:58.775
I find out our marriage is over,
in a letter.

31:58.776 --> 31:59.935
A letter?!

31:59.936 --> 32:01.295
Brought it on yourself.

32:01.296 --> 32:02.735
Abandonment?!

32:02.736 --> 32:05.575
I never even had him to abandon -
he always had something

32:05.576 --> 32:09.575
more interesting to occupy himself
with than me or his kids.

32:10.576 --> 32:13.135
I just wanted to hurt him,
like he hurt me.

32:13.136 --> 32:15.175
So you tell him Debbie's dead
to hurt him?

32:15.176 --> 32:18.255
All right, so I was wrong -
naughty Mummy!

32:18.256 --> 32:19.695
You hurt the rest of us too.

32:19.696 --> 32:23.695
How dare he be so fucking happy!

32:27.096 --> 32:29.575
I've got 18 grand
coming my way.

32:29.576 --> 32:30.855
Come with me.

32:30.856 --> 32:32.495
No.

32:32.496 --> 32:35.295
Disneyland?

32:35.296 --> 32:39.255
Florida, not the shit one.

32:39.256 --> 32:40.975
All right.

32:40.976 --> 32:42.255
You'd better be off, then.

32:42.256 --> 32:43.815
I'll wait until the bus comes.

32:43.816 --> 32:46.415
It'll only make it worse.

32:46.416 --> 32:48.295
Anyway, your dad'll need you.

32:48.296 --> 32:49.375
He'll be all right.

32:49.376 --> 32:51.055
Stag night should sort him out.

32:51.056 --> 32:52.135
Stag night?

32:52.136 --> 32:56.135
Tonight. Bye.

33:22.896 --> 33:24.215
Jackson!

33:24.216 --> 33:26.135
Stag do, tonight?

33:26.136 --> 33:28.255
Sorry - I'm busy, Carl.
Relatives coming.

33:28.256 --> 33:29.615
Lockdown!

33:29.616 --> 33:30.775
Forgot to tell you,

33:30.776 --> 33:34.775
They've cancelled. He'll be there.

33:35.376 --> 33:36.735
Fuck d'you do that for?

33:36.736 --> 33:40.655
Because it's the third time you've been
asked and the third time you've said no.

33:40.656 --> 33:42.015
What have I got in common
with any of them?

33:42.016 --> 33:43.255
Football, politics?

33:43.256 --> 33:46.095
I'm sure they might not even have heard
of Martin Luther King

33:46.096 --> 33:48.095
and swung their pants to Bob Marley.

33:48.096 --> 33:50.095
You think this is about colour?

33:50.096 --> 33:53.095
No - I think it's about you
being an uptight,

33:53.096 --> 33:56.215
conceited tosspot with
a superiority complex.

33:56.216 --> 34:00.215
You're a trainee teacher,
not a fucking Nobel Prize winner.

34:00.216 --> 34:02.575
And if we've got any chance
of fitting in round here

34:02.576 --> 34:04.230
you'd do well to remember that.

34:06.350 --> 34:09.554
I am not having a stag do!

34:09.830 --> 34:11.295
Look, we need to celebrate.

34:11.572 --> 34:13.735
Liam's good as well
to keep an eye on him.

34:13.735 --> 34:16.400
Someone's got to make sure he gets home in
one piece and it ain't going to be me.

34:16.601 --> 34:18.962
No, no, no, we need a theme.

34:19.176 --> 34:20.855
Come as your favourite blonde!

34:20.856 --> 34:24.855
Er... Marilyn, er,
Madonna, Hulk Hogan.

34:25.216 --> 34:25.815
Elvis?

34:25.815 --> 34:27.895
Elvis?
Ooh, I am liking that one.

34:27.896 --> 34:29.735
Young Elvis, old Elvis, fat Elvis.

34:29.735 --> 34:33.295
Dead Elvis.I am not fucking
dressing up for anyone.

34:33.295 --> 34:37.295
Which means there's only
one thing for it, then.

34:53.775 --> 34:55.695
Jackson. Voddie chaser?

34:55.696 --> 34:58.015
Bit early, cheers, Jamie.
Half a lager'll do me.

35:13.306 --> 35:17.305
That's more like it, baby!

35:36.066 --> 35:40.065
Open them legs!
Fuckin' have some of that!

35:59.146 --> 36:02.705
Get up, lad! Get up, lad!

36:02.706 --> 36:04.745
Party games!

36:04.746 --> 36:08.745
Oh, fuck that.
How old do you think I am?

36:11.106 --> 36:15.105
Bouncy castle!

36:22.706 --> 36:26.705
Pin the tail on the donkey!

36:56.426 --> 37:00.425
Hey, y'know, to say that I was
not looking forward to tonight

37:01.986 --> 37:03.705
is an understatement.

37:03.706 --> 37:04.905
Obviously!

37:04.906 --> 37:08.905
But it has been
fuckin' monu-fuckin'-mental.

37:14.866 --> 37:18.865
It's times like this when you, you,
you know who your real friends are.

37:21.226 --> 37:25.025
We love you, too, Frank.

37:25.026 --> 37:27.905
Friends,

37:27.906 --> 37:31.065
brothers, in arms, y'know,
who care, y'know,

37:31.066 --> 37:34.585
who's willing to go that extra mile.

37:34.586 --> 37:38.585
I think that's going
a bit too far, actually, mate.

37:46.706 --> 37:50.305
Bastards! You bas...!

37:50.306 --> 37:54.305
Liam! Liam!

37:55.346 --> 37:59.345
Liam, Liam!

38:04.466 --> 38:06.105
You look like shit, Mimi.

38:06.106 --> 38:07.625
And you sell your fanny
for a living,

38:07.626 --> 38:09.425
but do you hear me
going on about that?

38:09.426 --> 38:13.305
What was it exactly
they were arrested for?

38:13.306 --> 38:17.305
♪ Chariots Of Fire: VANGELIS

38:29.186 --> 38:30.545
So did Frank behave himself?

38:30.546 --> 38:31.705
I made sure of it.

38:31.706 --> 38:33.545
Home. Please. Now.

38:33.546 --> 38:34.985
Sorry?!

38:34.986 --> 38:36.625
She's due a feed in an hour.

38:36.626 --> 38:38.585
Good night?

38:38.586 --> 38:41.505
Was all right. Wouldn't have bothered
going if you hadn't pushed me.

38:41.506 --> 38:44.865
Fry up back at home, Carl.

38:44.866 --> 38:48.865
Vitamin C and a darkened room.

38:55.906 --> 38:59.905
Wait!

39:00.226 --> 39:04.225
Where's Frank?

39:06.906 --> 39:09.865
It was a night of revelry,
high spirits.

39:09.866 --> 39:13.865
All I want to know is, where is he?

39:15.666 --> 39:18.825
Will you please take this seriously?
Frank is missing.

39:18.826 --> 39:20.545
The man I intend to marry

39:20.546 --> 39:24.145
has disappeared and
I need to know where he's got to!

39:24.146 --> 39:28.145
Off dipping his wick somewhere
it's not wanted. Spilling his seed.

39:29.546 --> 39:32.705
Look, we're sorry,
we can't really remember much.

39:32.706 --> 39:33.905
Where did you see him last?

39:33.906 --> 39:37.785
Before we proceed,
I think Liam should leave the room.

39:37.786 --> 39:38.905
This could get ugly.

39:38.906 --> 39:40.625
He's fine with ugly.

39:40.626 --> 39:44.625
That brass was a right minger,
weren't she?

39:54.386 --> 39:58.385
A prostitute?! No offence.

39:58.626 --> 40:01.185
None taken.
Even I draw the line at prepubescent.

40:01.186 --> 40:03.105
And whose bright idea was that?

40:03.106 --> 40:04.905
What were you doing in a brothel?

40:04.906 --> 40:07.665
You weren't treating
Frank to anything, were you?

40:07.666 --> 40:09.785
No. He weren't there, then.
He'd left.

40:09.786 --> 40:11.185
Left? You let him go?

40:11.186 --> 40:12.865
On his own?

40:12.866 --> 40:16.345
Libby, we were pissed.

40:16.346 --> 40:18.185
What those men did...

40:18.186 --> 40:20.785
I call them men.

40:20.786 --> 40:24.145
Your first time only happens once and
it shouldn't happen at the age of 12,

40:24.146 --> 40:26.825
shoved into a room with a
woman old enough to be your mother.

40:26.826 --> 40:27.865
She was 18.

40:27.866 --> 40:31.465
I don't know if that's worse.

40:31.466 --> 40:34.025
We didn't do it.

40:34.026 --> 40:38.025
You mean you're...intacto?

40:38.066 --> 40:41.465
I'm not sure that term applies
to the male of the species.

40:41.466 --> 40:43.465
I gave her the money for her time,

40:43.466 --> 40:45.025
won it back in a game
of three-card brag.

40:45.026 --> 40:49.025
Kept enough for
a fish supper and a cab home.

40:49.866 --> 40:52.825
When was the last time you saw him?

40:52.826 --> 40:55.505
Think, Liam, please.

40:55.506 --> 40:59.265
In the cemetery.

40:59.266 --> 41:03.265
He'll be all right.
I know he will be.

41:04.506 --> 41:08.505
Yeah. No.

41:09.266 --> 41:11.225
Yeah, but no.

41:11.226 --> 41:14.225
But it can't be, "Yeah, but no."
You either saw him or you didn't.

41:14.226 --> 41:17.665
It was someone like that, but black.

41:17.666 --> 41:19.985
This guy was dressed like that,
but a dwarf.

41:19.986 --> 41:21.905
No, he was definitely Asian.

41:21.906 --> 41:25.905
He had a terrible problem
with saliva. Kept dribbling.

41:32.266 --> 41:35.625
These are from Mimi. You told her
we were having Libby's hen do here?

41:35.626 --> 41:36.665
Mm-hmm.

41:36.666 --> 41:38.225
Why?

41:38.226 --> 41:41.305
Cos Libby needs cheering up
and I fancy a bit of female company.

41:41.306 --> 41:42.465
Who's invited?

41:42.466 --> 41:45.465
Plenty more where this came from.
Loads left in the kitty, too.

41:45.466 --> 41:47.465
We can splash
what's left on a stripper.

41:47.466 --> 41:51.465
Bit of a busman's holiday
for me, Lillian. No cock, please.

41:51.826 --> 41:54.385
So, lager, cider, vodka, mixers.

41:54.386 --> 41:55.407
And no cock.

41:55.527 --> 41:56.910
I'll have a cock, if it's on offer.

41:57.030 --> 41:58.265
You'll have to bring your own.

41:58.266 --> 41:59.917
Can we not just have a little cock?

42:00.037 --> 42:02.120
A little one's
hardly worth having, is it?

42:07.866 --> 42:11.545
Just off to the pub.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

42:11.546 --> 42:13.625
Don't rush back.

42:13.626 --> 42:14.945
And, ladies!

42:14.946 --> 42:18.625
Sorry. Can I just ask that you don't
touch the vinyl? Collector's items.

42:18.626 --> 42:21.505
Alphabetised, would you believe?

42:21.506 --> 42:23.945
I would, if I knew what it meant.

42:23.946 --> 42:25.625
I should move this, too.

42:26.055 --> 42:27.640
Bloody hell, it looks like
a brewery under here.

42:27.690 --> 42:28.575
Ah, shit!

42:28.791 --> 42:30.519
You've not toasted Libby yet!

42:30.639 --> 42:33.164
And you're not getting out of here
until you do.

42:45.146 --> 42:48.665
Put a smile on your face,
for everyone else's sake,

42:48.666 --> 42:50.425
if not your own.

42:50.426 --> 42:53.025
Something's wrong, Mum.
I can feel it.

42:53.026 --> 42:57.025
Liam said he's done this type of thing a
thousand times when he was with Monica.

42:57.026 --> 42:59.345
But he's never done it once
while he's been with me.

42:59.346 --> 43:01.865
Maybe he's got cold feet.

43:01.866 --> 43:04.745
There's no maybe about it,
the man doesn't want to marry you.

43:04.746 --> 43:07.025
What more does he need
to do to convince you?

43:07.026 --> 43:09.065
You're determined to see me unhappy.

43:09.066 --> 43:10.905
I'm determined
to make you see sense.

43:10.906 --> 43:12.505
You asked him to prove he loved you

43:12.506 --> 43:16.505
and he's failed miserably.
End of story.

43:17.986 --> 43:20.105
All right? Don't mind, do you?

43:20.106 --> 43:21.945
The pub was a bit empty.

43:21.946 --> 43:23.545
Food's that way.
Booze on the table.

43:23.546 --> 43:27.545
Anything could land us in court's in
the backyard and at your own risk.

43:31.426 --> 43:34.065
How many's he had?

43:34.066 --> 43:36.105
One.

43:36.106 --> 43:38.785
Yes, lads! You made it!

43:38.786 --> 43:41.505
I think Mum might be right.

43:41.506 --> 43:43.545
Maybe I pushed him too far,

43:43.546 --> 43:45.745
made too many demands.

43:45.746 --> 43:48.025
Maybe I've frightened him off.

43:48.026 --> 43:52.025
Maybe he's sleeping off
the mother of all hangovers

43:52.266 --> 43:56.265
and you'll see him bright
and bushy-eyed tomorrow morning.

43:57.386 --> 44:00.305
Chill, Libs. Stress is a killer!

44:00.306 --> 44:03.665
Never happier than when she's
got something to complain about.

44:06.426 --> 44:09.905
Will you look at that?

44:09.906 --> 44:12.145
Terrible behaviour.

44:12.146 --> 44:16.145
Off! Off! Off!

44:16.186 --> 44:20.185
Off! Off! Off!

44:20.546 --> 44:24.545
What is it you're on, Mimi?

44:35.426 --> 44:39.425
Holy Mother preserve us!

44:45.746 --> 44:48.225
Come on, Mimi, it's not that big!

44:48.226 --> 44:50.036
Come on, Mum.Mum?

44:50.561 --> 44:52.025
Oh, fuck! Ambulance. Quick!

44:52.026 --> 44:53.569
Mam? Mam!

44:53.689 --> 44:54.846
Give us your phone.
Mam?

45:03.906 --> 45:07.385
Good luck, Mimi!

45:17.826 --> 45:21.825
Frank!

45:23.386 --> 45:27.385
'And even if you do find
that you are indeed

45:27.666 --> 45:34.665
'the only being in existence and that
everyone else, everything else in your world

45:34.666 --> 45:40.065
'is merely a figment
of your imagination, just enjoy it.'

46:00.266 --> 46:01.983
I heard a whisper
that Frank's missing.

46:02.103 --> 46:03.980
Libby! We have to get back to Libby!

46:04.100 --> 46:05.841
You're not up to running
the business, Shane.

46:05.866 --> 46:06.660
Bollocks!

46:06.780 --> 46:08.510
I'm married to the
head of the family now.

46:10.706 --> 46:12.425
If I make a complaint,
you could lose your job?

46:12.426 --> 46:15.665
Liam and Stella are my
babies and they should be with me.

46:15.666 --> 46:18.830
If it carries on like this we'll lose
the business or someone'll get hurt.

46:18.950 --> 46:20.299
Finish it now!

46:20.741 --> 46:22.625
Yeees!

46:22.626 --> 46:23.825
Yes!

46:23.826 --> 46:25.665
You called the council.

46:25.666 --> 46:27.505
You're not taking
Liam and Stella away.

46:27.506 --> 46:31.505
We have got to find your father.

47:12.026 --> 47:15.825
'You hear about
these alien abductions

47:15.826 --> 47:19.825
'and it's all terror and fear.
One-eyed green monsters dragging you

47:20.026 --> 47:24.025
'across the universe
to aid their experiments.

47:24.066 --> 47:28.065
'But that's not been my experience.

47:28.186 --> 47:31.025
'Quite the opposite, in fact.

47:31.026 --> 47:33.945
'No complaints thus far.

47:33.946 --> 47:35.305
'No interference of any sort.

47:35.306 --> 47:38.665
'You know, no temperature taken, no
blood pressure, no blood samples.

47:38.666 --> 47:42.665
'Even managed to escape
the old anal probing.

47:46.426 --> 47:50.425
'I think I spoke too soon.'

47:53.426 --> 47:57.425
Argh!
