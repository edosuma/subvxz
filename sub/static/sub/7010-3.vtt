12:28.998 --> 12:31.249
MAN, THAT'S GREAT.

12:31.292 --> 12:36.045
OH, MICHAEL, YOU ARE THE
BEST DOLL I HAVE EVER HAD.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.213
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:37.256 --> 12:38.465
I HAVE THE PERFECT
GOWN FOR YOU.

12:38.507 --> 12:41.593
A-ALL RIGHT,
JACKIE, SLOW DOWN.

12:41.635 --> 12:43.928
OKAY, WEARING LIPSTICK
IS ONE THING,

12:43.971 --> 12:48.308
BUT A GOWN?
THAT'S KIND OF FRUITY.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.477
NO, NO, IT'S NOT,
MICHAEL.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.103
BOWIE WEARS DRESSES.

12:57.902 --> 13:01.029
JACKIE, I SAID NO.

13:01.822 --> 13:05.575
ALL RIGHT. NOTHING TOO
GIRLY, AND I MEAN IT!

13:14.418 --> 13:17.170
[GRUNTS]

13:18.214 --> 13:22.550
WELL, SO MUCH FOR YOUR "HE

13:22.593 --> 13:24.302
THIS BITES, MAN.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.095
HE CAN'T KEEP US OUT OF
THERE. I MEAN, WHAT?

13:26.138 --> 13:29.098
DID WE WAKE UP IN
RUSSIA THIS MORNING?

13:29.141 --> 13:31.643
NO. WE DID NOT,
IN FACT,

13:31.685 --> 13:34.103
WAKE UP IN RUSSIA
THIS MORNING.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.606
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.733
HEY, LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING, PAL.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.194
YOU'RE PROPPING UP
A DYING SYSTEM, MAN.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.696
YOU SEE, SOMEDAY SOON,
PEOPLE ARE GONNA WAKE UP,

13:43.739 --> 13:46.324
AND THEY'RE GONNA REALIZE THAT
MOST OF US DON'T FIT INTO YOUR

13:46.367 --> 13:48.993
HOLLYWOOD, MADISON AVENUE,
CANDY-COATED IDEAL

13:49.036 --> 13:50.411
OF WHAT'S COOL.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.664
AND WHEN WE DO,
WE'RE GONNA RISE UP,

13:52.706 --> 13:54.457
WE'RE GONNA PUT YOU
ON TRIAL,

13:54.500 --> 13:56.000
THEN PARADE
THROUGH THE STREETS

13:56.043 --> 13:59.879
WITH YOUR HEAD ON A STICK.

14:01.257 --> 14:04.259
RIGHTEOUS POLITICAL
OUTRAGE. YOU'RE IN.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.642
ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU
LATER, FORMAN.

14:17.314 --> 14:23.695
YEAH, WELL, WHEN THE
REVOLUTION COMES, MAN,

14:23.737 --> 14:27.949
YOUR BACKS COULD BE

14:27.992 --> 14:30.994
DAMN IT, LET ME IN! MY
GIRLFRIEND'S IN THERE!

14:31.036 --> 14:32.871
THE FOXY REDHEAD?

14:32.913 --> 14:36.124
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
YOUR SISTER.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.961
WHAT DOES SHE
SEE IN YOU?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.838
YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE SEES, BUDDY?

14:41.881 --> 14:46.217
YOU KNOW WHAT

14:49.388 --> 14:50.889
WELL, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING,

14:50.931 --> 14:52.140
IF SHE WAS

OKAY, WELL, YOU WILL
GET THEM NEXT TIME.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.252
AH, KITTY.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.713
THE WORLD'S CHANGING.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.923
THINGS AREN'T
TURNING OUT

15:24.965 --> 15:29.260
THE WAY I EXPECTED.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.054
WELL, RED,

15:31.096 --> 15:34.974

ON THE THRONE.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.206
"HI, HONEY.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?"

15:58.248 --> 16:01.209
"THEY GAVE ME
ANOTHER RAISE."

16:01.251 --> 16:03.169
"OH, HONEY, WITH ALL
THE MONEY YOU MAKE,

16:03.212 --> 16:06.047
IT'S NO WONDER
I DON'T HAVE TO WORK."

16:06.090 --> 16:08.216
DAUGHTER LAURIE
HAS A QUESTION.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.134
"DADDY, WHY IS
THE AMERICAN ECONOMY

16:10.177 --> 16:12.095
THE ENVY OF THE WORLD?"

16:12.137 --> 16:14.263
"WELL," SAYS DAD,

16:14.306 --> 16:15.807
"IT'S BECAUSE
THE AMERICAN WORKER

16:15.849 --> 16:21.437
IS EXPERIENCED, LOYAL,
AND HARD-WORKING."

16:21.480 --> 16:24.732
LOOKS LIKE JUNIOR
HAS SOME GOOD NEWS.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.527
"SAY, DAD, YOU CAN STOP
GIVING ME MONEY NOW.

16:27.569 --> 16:30.655
I JUST GOT A FOOTBALL
SCHOLARSHIP TO NOTRE DAME."

16:30.698 --> 16:34.283
I GUESS EXPERIENCE,
LOYALTY, AND HARD WORK

16:34.326 --> 16:37.328
REALLY DO PAY OFF."

16:37.371 --> 16:39.580
DAUGHTER LAURIE
HAS ANOTHER QUESTION.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.207
"DADDY, CAN YOU TELL ME

16:41.250 --> 16:44.585
WHY GERMANY AND JAPAN'S
ECONOMIES NEVER RECOVERED?"

16:44.628 --> 16:48.339
"IT'S SIMPLE.
THEY ARE NOT EXPERIENCED,

16:48.382 --> 16:50.425
"THEY ARE
NOT HARD-WORKING,

16:50.467 --> 16:52.427
"THEY ARE NOT LOYAL,

16:52.469 --> 16:55.221
AND THEY DO NOT
SPEAK ENGLISH."

16:55.264 --> 16:58.349
SPEAKING OF WORK, MOM HAS
TO GO GROCERY SHOPPING.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.518
"CAN I HAVE THE KEYS
TO THE CADILLAC?"

17:00.561 --> 17:05.064
"HA HA. FORGET THE CADILLAC.
TAKE THE HOVERCRAFT."

17:05.107 --> 17:12.864
THE HOVERCRAFT?

17:12.906 --> 17:17.869
WHAT? THEY PROMISED US
HOVERCRAFTS.

17:17.911 --> 17:22.206
JUST ANOTHER DAMN
BROKEN PROMISE.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.072
HEY, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.907
I'VE BEEN EXCLUDED
FROM LOTS OF THINGS.

17:55.949 --> 17:59.827
YEAH? LIKE WHAT?

18:02.539 --> 18:04.207
OH, NO, OKAY.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.750

18:05.793 --> 18:08.377
WE USED TO PLAY
DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE,

18:08.420 --> 18:12.882
AND NOBODY EVER PICKED ME
TO BE THE GOOSE.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.844
OH, WOW. THAT MUST
HAVE REALLY HURT.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.806
I DIDN'T CARE.

18:19.848 --> 18:22.350

18:30.150 --> 18:31.692
DUCK. MAYBE
HE'LL PICK ME.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.236
DUCK. MAYBE I'LL GET
TO RUN AND LAUGH

18:33.278 --> 18:34.612
WITH THE JOY OF
BEING THE GOOSE.

18:34.655 --> 18:35.822
AND THEN HE'D
COME TO YOU,

18:35.864 --> 18:37.073
PLACE HIS HAND ON YOUR
HEAD AND SAY "DUCK,"

18:37.116 --> 18:38.699
AND YOU'RE TELLING
