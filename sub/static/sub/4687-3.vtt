WEBVTT

01:16.410 --> 01:18.786
If today

01:18.871 --> 01:21.164
<i>Any shock they would try to stem</i>

01:21.248 --> 01:23.583
<i>'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock</i>

01:23.667 --> 01:27.962
<i>Plymouth Rock would land on them</i>

01:29.590 --> 01:31.674
<i>In olden days a glimpse of stocking</i>

01:31.759 --> 01:33.468
<i>Was looked on as something shocking</i>

01:33.552 --> 01:35.803
<i>But now God knows</i>

01:35.888 --> 01:38.347
<i>Anything goes</i>

01:38.432 --> 01:41.142
<i>Good authors, too, who once</i>
<i>knew better words</i>

01:41.226 --> 01:43.436
<i>Now only use four-letter words writing...</i>

01:43.520 --> 01:45.354
What the fuck is going on?

01:45.981 --> 01:48.274
-They're taking our hard drives.
-Is it Neal's story?

01:48.358 --> 01:49.859
They've got a warrant
to search the hard drives.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.778
- Is this for real?
- What's your name?

01:51.862 --> 01:52.904
-My name?
-Yeah.

01:52.988 --> 01:55.907
It's spelled arrest me or go fuck yourself.
We've been raided.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.201
It's Saturday night
and you got the graveyard shift.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.495
What would I find if I stop
and frisk you, Snoop Dogg?

02:00.579 --> 02:02.497
Unless that warrant says
you can stick your hand in my pockets,

02:02.581 --> 02:05.750
you're gonna find yourself in a conversation
about illegal search and seizure.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.503
All right, back off. Everybody just cooperate.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.632
-My password's N-Y...
-I don't need your password.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.511
-That's a comfort.
-Please stand away from your desks.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.471
Do you know where Neal Sampat is?

02:18.555 --> 02:20.097
What are my rights in this situation?

02:20.182 --> 02:23.559
You don't answer and you don't get
to keep asking that question.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.020
Actually, she does, but nobody has to answer.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.106
-So just turn down the temperature a...
-This is a fucking outrage, Molly.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.275
And this is a fucking warrant
from a federal court, Mac.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.237
And we are the physical manifestation
of the will of that court.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.197
The fuck are you, Marley's ghost?

02:36.281 --> 02:37.865
You kiss your sources with that mouth?

02:37.950 --> 02:39.700
Don, please stay where you are.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.494
I'd like to make sure
my phones aren't being tapped.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.995
They don't have permission
to tap our phones.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.332
Then I guess this would be the first time
the FBI has used a warrantless wiretap.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.834
Can I save you guys some time?

02:47.918 --> 02:49.836
Neal is a smart guy
and there's no way he left a trail

02:49.920 --> 02:52.380
to a government source on something
that can be seized by the government.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.298
I've got privileged stock information
on my computer.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.760
- I see one of you guys buy a speedboat...
- They're just doing their jobs.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.804
And I'm doing mine.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.305
- Charlie.

03:02.474 --> 03:05.601
It's Charlie Skinner.
Give me LA control, please.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.645
Please put the phone down, Mr. Skinner.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.772
Don, Jim, power up our control room.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.440
-Yeah.
-Gary, grab a camera.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.777
-Can you get me wired?
-Guys!

03:14.862 --> 03:16.487
It's Charlie in New York.

03:16.572 --> 03:18.906
We're gonna be breaking in live
in three minutes.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.663
Do you have the first idea
how any of this equipment works?

03:25.747 --> 03:27.748
I don't know how electricity works.
Just start pressing buttons.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.000
We don't know how to broadcast anything.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.710
Charlie was on the phone
with Domino's Pizza.

03:30.794 --> 03:31.794
We're not broadcasting anything.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.421
Just get an in-house feed up on the monitors.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.968
Don't make things harder on yourselves.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.845
I think I'm making things harder for you.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.639
Come on, Mac. We've been friends forever.
I'm coming to your wedding.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.100
Well, I haven't gotten your RSVP yet, Molly.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.768
So how'd you like your name chyroned?

03:47.853 --> 03:49.186
This is now out of control.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.522
It's not hard to promptly RSVP.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.941
-It's a common courtesy.
-90 seconds.

03:55.694 --> 03:56.694
They're bluffing.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.782
Hook me up, quick.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.330
Come on, guys. Find some lights.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.542
See, I don't think there's gonna be
an on-off switch.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.588
-Check it out.
-What did you press?

04:16.924 --> 04:18.007
It's an on-off switch.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.509
What is on our air?

04:20.594 --> 04:22.386
Red Carpet Roundup. We need a studio feed.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.764
Can I just say that this
network's Saturday night programing is...

04:24.848 --> 04:27.099
Maybe now's not the time. But I do agree.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.226
How have neither of you in all this time

04:29.311 --> 04:31.395
absorbed any of the technology involved

04:31.480 --> 04:33.898
with broadcasting the news
you, you know, do?

04:34.024 --> 04:36.025
Well, I can't speak for Don,
but my experience is...

04:36.109 --> 04:37.401
Shut up.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.788
Do we have sound? Can anybody hear me?

04:51.375 --> 04:53.876
We're gonna need your first name
for the banner.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.044
Is it Kip?

04:55.587 --> 04:57.880
Your lack of cooperation
will be noted for our report.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.548
I hope that doesn't leak to the press.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.801
-I'm gonna make sure it does.
-I'm being cooperative.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.303
Can it be noted that some of us
are being downright docile?

05:04.388 --> 05:07.139
-So it's Kip?
-Rodger with a D.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.351
-We're gonna misspell it.
-$210 a plate, Molly.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.561
It's nice to have a head count.
He's not made of money.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.397
I do fine. We can afford it.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.483
- We're up.
- That's nice, Gary.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.276
Yeah, start on the windbreakers

05:19.361 --> 05:21.404
and then come over and frame up

05:21.571 --> 05:23.614
Special Agent Levy for the hero shot.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.286
There's a typo. You left out the R.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.497
-Where?
-It says, "Beaking News."

05:32.249 --> 05:34.834
Calm down. Can she hear you on the IFB?

05:34.918 --> 05:38.004
No. Please, please, pretend you can hear me.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.423
<i>-Copy, I can hear you.</i>
-She did it!

05:40.507 --> 05:43.092
-She felt my vibe.
-I think she can really hear you.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.802
-It says, "Baking News" now.
-Fuck!

05:45.429 --> 05:48.139
-15 seconds.
-Good talking to you, Molly.

05:48.223 --> 05:51.225
You and your men continue your
government raid of an American newsroom.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.185
I'm gonna go executive produce
a special report.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.604
Stand them down.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.241
Stand down.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.039
Everybody stand down.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.588
LA control, keep your air.

06:29.723 --> 06:30.973
They're stopping! Shh.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.060
We did it.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.063
Freedom won and not a bullet was fired.

06:37.147 --> 06:40.316
-Let this day be recorded in the all...
-Your fly is unzipped.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.238
I'm not sure how I feel
about new confident Maggie.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.574
She's looking good.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.076
<i>I can still hear you.</i>

06:52.079 --> 06:53.329
Do you think there's any chance she's, uh...

06:53.413 --> 06:54.914
<i>I'm not pretending.</i>

07:03.507 --> 07:06.801
Seems like lately a lot of people have been
playing fast and loose with the law.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.178
I didn't break any laws.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.764
It was a solid warrant
and they had a solid reason for seeking it.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.265
I'm not at all convinced we're the good guys.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.559
-Where was he supposed to go?
-The source?

07:15.644 --> 07:17.603
Where was he supposed to go? The police?

07:17.687 --> 07:20.940
He's not supposed to go anywhere
with classified information.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.942
That was the Assistant Attorney General,

07:23.026 --> 07:24.485
the US Attorney for the Southern District,

07:24.569 --> 07:26.445
and the Deputy Director
of the FBI on the phone.

07:27.656 --> 07:28.697
And?

07:29.366 --> 07:32.076
We've negotiated a one-week ceasefire.

07:32.536 --> 07:35.121
Friday night we'll all meet up
at Main Justice in DC

07:35.205 --> 07:36.705
and try to dig our way out of this.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.499
I'm not holding this story for a week.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.918
-Holding the story for a week isn't a problem.
-It's a problem for me.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.712
Doesn't it take at least a week
to vet 27,000 documents?

07:43.797 --> 07:46.132
If you put the same scrupulous attention
into vetting this story

07:46.216 --> 07:48.050
as you did with Genoa,
you should be done in no time.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.177
You are sitting at the loser table.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.972
-At your wedding, what else is available?
-There goes your plus one.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.807
All right, look, what I need is an assurance

07:54.891 --> 07:56.600
that it's safe for Neal to come out of the dark.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.103
The government is not going to make a move
on either of you

07:59.187 --> 08:01.480
until Friday, and then hopefully never.

08:01.565 --> 08:03.566
-They're still walking out of here with...
-Shh, shh, shh.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.152
Agents Levy, Hutchinson,
thank you very much.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.695
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.866
You're getting the fish
and the fish is gonna suck!

08:11.950 --> 08:13.492
You're talking about your own wedding.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.327
-She's got a point.
-Where's Neal?

08:15.412 --> 08:16.871
-I don't know.
-Come on.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.165
-I don't know where he is.
-Good.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.792
-You did something right.
-He's safe.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.546
What?

08:27.591 --> 08:30.593
He's safe. That's all I know.
And don't ask me about it again, okay?

08:30.677 --> 08:31.760
Yeah.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.095
Can I speak with you?

08:34.764 --> 08:37.600
-I'm not sure I like the deal you just made.
-I don't care.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.936
-How do you know he's safe?
-It's a premonition.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.480
Did you... Fucking hell.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.149
-Did you tell him where to go?
-No.

08:45.609 --> 08:48.194
-Did you give him money? A bus ticket?
-No.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.448
What happens Friday night?

08:54.743 --> 08:56.452
The investigators are gonna ask you and Neal

08:56.536 --> 08:59.288
to tell them everything you can
without revealing the source.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.625
If they can connect the dots
without the identity of the source, great.

09:02.709 --> 09:03.751
If they can't?

09:04.586 --> 09:07.630
I don't know a district court judge
who's ever let a reporter

09:07.714 --> 09:10.007
keep his source when national security
was involved.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.509
And who decides if national security
is involved?

09:12.594 --> 09:13.928
-The judge.
-You see my problem?

09:14.012 --> 09:15.429
The judge is the one
who's supposed to decide,

09:15.513 --> 09:17.973
not Matthew Broderick in WarGames,
not Neal, and not me.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.892
- That's a prosecutor talking.
- Yes, it is.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.810
And how are we supposed
to be in DC Friday night?

09:21.937 --> 09:24.605
-We do the news here at 8:00.
-The meeting's at midnight.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.815
All right, obviously
we'll talk more before then.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.401
But for now just go drink...
Home. Just go home.

09:30.111 --> 09:34.198
That stunt with the cameras, that wasn't cool.

09:34.908 --> 09:35.950
Neither am I.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.827
All right.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.538
We give them everything they want,

09:41.623 --> 09:43.916
and in exchange we get to not go to jail?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.709
We also get to run the story.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.003
We get the guidance we need to run the story

09:48.088 --> 09:50.673
without risking national security
or anyone's life.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.217
Good night.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.637
I'm only going to ask you once.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.017
Do you really know the identity of the source?

10:03.019 --> 10:04.728
-Yes.
-That was stupid.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.230
That was something I would do.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.232
They're not gonna lock me up.
I'm too big to jail.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.944
Until about half an hour ago,
I thought they wouldn't raid a newsroom.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.195
They've got his hard drive now

10:13.280 --> 10:15.447
and if there's anything on there
that shows he's aided and abetted,

10:15.532 --> 10:18.826
then you and Neal
are in two very different situations.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.869
He used an air-gapped computer, remember?

10:20.996 --> 10:22.663
-And where is he?
-I don't know.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.082
-Are you lying to me?
-No.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.755
You know, since it's not possible

10:31.840 --> 10:33.966
for everyone to like you, I really think...

10:34.050 --> 10:35.801
I wasn't trying to get the FBI to like me.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.553
They just happen to be
the only ones in the room

10:37.637 --> 10:39.138
authorized to do what they're doing.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.098
Why do we have a loser table?

10:41.891 --> 10:43.976
-Your friends.
-All right.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.760
-Hi. I have here an EPA report that's been...
-Hi.

11:19.262 --> 11:22.765
Hi. I have here an EPA report
that's been embargoed.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.476
-How did you get it?
-It doesn't matter.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.312
The Scripps Institution of Oceanography
in San Diego

11:28.396 --> 11:30.105
measured the levels of carbon dioxide

11:30.190 --> 11:32.066
atop Mauna Loa, a volcano in Hawaii,

11:32.150 --> 11:35.694
and found that it's passed
a long-feared milestone, 400 parts per million,

11:35.779 --> 11:38.947
which is a concentration
not seen on Earth in millions of years.

11:39.991 --> 11:41.033
Here's what happened.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.785
You started talking about CO2 levels

11:42.952 --> 11:44.953
and I started thinking about
other things in my head.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.749
CO2 is a gas.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.210
The Scripps Institution of Oceanography,

11:51.294 --> 11:53.212
which is made up of professional scientists,

11:53.296 --> 11:55.672
measured the level of CO2 in the air
and found...

11:55.757 --> 11:58.467
The Mets need speed. The Mets need power.
The Mets need pitching.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.927
That's what I'm thinking about right now.

12:02.305 --> 12:05.391
Living things need oxygen to stay alive.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.767
-I want a hot dog right now.
-Look...

12:06.851 --> 12:08.102
Have you come to me for help?

12:08.186 --> 12:09.395
-Have I...
-Come to me for help?

12:09.479 --> 12:10.646
-No.
-What can I do for you?

12:11.523 --> 12:12.898
I'd like some advice.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.233
-What's another word for advice?
-Look...

12:14.317 --> 12:16.527
You showed a lot of wisdom
coming to me for help.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.070
-I don't need help.
-Great.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.571
-I need help.
-Hit me.

12:19.656 --> 12:20.656
Ooh.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.243
-Yeah, I think you know what I meant.
-Yeah, I think I did.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.453
This is an embargoed EPA report.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.038
-How'd you get it?
-Doesn't matter.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.833
The last time the levels were this high
was three million years ago.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.001
-We survived it then, right?
-No, there were no humans.

12:33.086 --> 12:36.380
-It wiped out all the humans?
-There were no humans before, you moron.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.507
Talking like that is no way
to get me to help you.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.759
The last time the CO2 level was this high,

12:40.844 --> 12:43.554
the climate was far warmer,
the ice caps were smaller,

12:43.638 --> 12:45.305
the sea levels 60-80 feet higher.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.266
Scientists believe that humanity

12:47.350 --> 12:50.102
is precipitating a return to those conditions,
only this time...

12:50.186 --> 12:52.020
-Billions of people are in harm's way.
-Yes.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.773
I would take any one of the three,
speed, power, or pitching.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.359
And this is my problem.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.236
-That environmental stories aren't exciting?
-Right.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.196
I've been doing a dramatic rendering
of that problem.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.866
This report says
the world is coming to an end.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.827
I am preparing an interview
for Will to conduct on Friday

13:06.911 --> 13:09.455
with the Deputy Assistant Administrator
of the EPA.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.874
On Friday, when everybody watches the news.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.042
Mac's put it in the B block.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.961
When I asked her what story

13:16.045 --> 13:18.088
she felt was going to trump
the end of the world,

13:18.173 --> 13:20.883
she said, "I don't know,
but I'm sure something will come up."

13:20.967 --> 13:23.093
So you want this to feel more
like a Jim Harper segment

13:23.178 --> 13:24.595
and less like a Maggie Jordan segment?

13:26.097 --> 13:28.182
-Just say yes.
-Yes.

13:28.266 --> 13:29.766
-Have you marked this up?
-Yeah.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.657
There's nothing unimportant in there.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.284
Then what was the point of highlighting it?

13:47.368 --> 13:48.869
- To amplify its importance.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.455
How much time do we have to tell
our audience about the end of the world?

13:51.539 --> 13:53.832
-Four minutes and 10 seconds.
-Who's the interview with?

13:53.917 --> 13:56.251
The Deputy Assistant Administrator
of the EPA.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.503
We can't get the head of the EPA?

13:57.587 --> 13:58.837
There is no head of the EPA.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.214
Tell me when you're done reading the report

14:00.298 --> 14:02.216
-so I can explain it to you.
-I'll be able to understand it.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.176
-Without Neal here to help?
-I know how to use a dictionary.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.469
Without Neal here to show you?

14:05.803 --> 14:08.430
-Looking forward to working with you.
-I'm dreading it. Have a good day.

14:10.141 --> 14:11.350
How'd you get the report?

14:12.018 --> 14:13.977
CO2 means two parts of oxygen

14:14.062 --> 14:15.270
for every one part of carbon.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.774
- I know that. Wait...
- Yeah, I know that.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.529
Yeah, I'll let him know.

14:27.909 --> 14:30.035
Reese and Mrs. Lansing
are on their way down to see you.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.331
-They're coming down here?
-Yeah.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.124
You sure they didn't
want me to come up there?

14:36.584 --> 14:37.960
No, they're on their way.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.839
Everyone knows something's going on.
We just don't know what.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.384
Yeah, I know.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.679
Just show them in when they get here.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.640
-They're here.
-Thank you.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.317
Leona, I didn't know you knew
where my office was.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.319
I followed Reese.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.154
I'm assuming you didn't come down to tell me

15:06.239 --> 15:08.574
you found $4 billion
in the glove compartment.

15:08.658 --> 15:09.658
Well, I tried.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.578
The glove compartment may be
the only place I haven't looked.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.372
Where do you look for that kind of money,
just out of curiosity?

15:15.456 --> 15:17.082
We offered shares to a special investor

15:17.166 --> 15:20.210
to buy up a portion of the company
and dilute the ownership stake of the twins,

15:20.295 --> 15:23.088
but we hit a roadblock with the board.

15:23.172 --> 15:26.133
We thought about changing the bylaws,
but the lawyer said it wouldn't hold.

15:26.217 --> 15:29.761
We tried banks and hedge funds,
but they know we're already too leveraged.

15:29.846 --> 15:33.348
I have a $58 million Jackson Pollock,
$140 million yacht.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.309
It's not nearly enough collateral.

15:35.393 --> 15:38.228
Boy, listen closely, you can almost hear
someone singing,

15:38.313 --> 15:39.938
<i>Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?</i>

15:40.023 --> 15:42.774
- Yeah, I know.
- I had a perfectly good idea.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.276
-No, you didn't.
-What was it?

15:44.736 --> 15:46.528
Poison them.
Poison my half-brother and sister.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.196
Just go Shakespeare on their ass.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.699
-I know people, you know people.
-I don't know people.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.826
All right, well,
there's no such thing as a bad idea.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.037
Yes, there is such a thing as a bad idea.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.205
Horizontal stripes. That.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.207
I think I know what's coming.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.375
- Charlie.
- Yeah?

16:00.543 --> 16:03.086
Randy and Blair, but especially Blair,
and mostly Blair,

16:03.171 --> 16:05.213
have to be stopped
from selling their shares to Savannah.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.591
The only way to raise the money before they...

16:07.675 --> 16:09.384
Is to spin off ACN.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.684
Yeah.

16:20.438 --> 16:23.190
The buyer is a man named Lucas Pruit.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.816
He's 43 and lives...

16:24.901 --> 16:26.860
In Palo Alto. No wife, no kids.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.195
Stanford '92. Harvard MBA.

16:28.279 --> 16:31.281
Goldman for five years as a tech analyst,
then he left to start his own company.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.449
Yeah, I don't know what they do.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.950
They made a WiFi accelerator.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.453
He's the 1,398th richest person in the world.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.121
Can I ask some questions?

16:38.206 --> 16:40.123
Did they try to dilute
the twins' ownership stake?

16:40.208 --> 16:42.000
-Changing the bylaws?
-Yes. Lawyer said no.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.503
-Offering long-term contracts and platinum...
-They tried everything.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.089
What about selling another division? Why us?

16:47.173 --> 16:49.883
Tax consequences.
We were the right price and...

16:50.593 --> 16:51.927
- It's a trophy sale.
- Yeah.

16:52.929 --> 16:56.890
Owning a news network's cooler than owning
a location detection software company.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.809
Would you coven of knee-jerk, lefty bigots

16:58.893 --> 17:01.103
not condemn the man
until after he's said hello?

17:01.187 --> 17:03.897
I know he's committed the unpardonable
crime of making a lot of money,

17:03.981 --> 17:06.024
but perhaps in spite of his talent, hard work,

17:06.109 --> 17:08.443
and enormous accomplishments,
he's still a decent guy.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.613
Yeah, whose ideas are worth listening to.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.657
Yeah. Wait, what?

17:14.492 --> 17:16.284
-He has ideas?
-Yeah.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.912
So here's what I need us to do.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.373
What you need us to do
or what the Lansings need us to do?

17:21.457 --> 17:24.418
At this moment, what the Lansings want
is what I want.

17:24.502 --> 17:27.170
They spent the last year doing nothing
but standing by us

17:27.255 --> 17:29.381
when it made a lot more sense to not.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.633
Not to. Not to stand by...

17:32.009 --> 17:33.301
To not stand by...

17:34.303 --> 17:36.513
-I'm saying it would have made more sense...
-Find your way home.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.640
-...to dump us.
-I agree.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.977
And since the alternative
to selling ACN to Pruit

17:42.437 --> 17:45.021
is ACN being dissolved by Savannah Capital,

17:45.106 --> 17:46.398
we're gonna love his ideas.

17:46.816 --> 17:47.858
Sure.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.110
Saturday night at the Correspondents' Dinner.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.945
We're not going to
the Correspondents' Dinner.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.321
- We are now.
- I can't.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.490
The Justice Department is Friday night

17:55.742 --> 17:57.451
and the Correspondents' Dinner is Saturday.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.579
We can't go because last year
he railed against the Correspondents' Dinner

18:00.663 --> 18:02.164
and said we'd no longer be going.

18:02.373 --> 18:04.499
-Where?
-To the Correspondents' Dinner.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.335
-Where did you rail against it?
-On TV.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.796
-What network?
-This one. My show.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.715
I think I remember now.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.759
"ACN won't be attending

18:13.843 --> 18:17.262
"the Saturnalia of incestuous ingratiation..."

18:17.346 --> 18:19.222
-Oh, brother.
-..."that does little to instill confidence

18:19.307 --> 18:23.518
"in the public that the press
isn't ensorcelled by the powerful."

18:23.603 --> 18:25.187
I think I was trying to quit smoking that week.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.231
Well, don't do that again, 'cause that was
some huckleberry-bad writing.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.025
-What do you want us to do?
-Go anyway.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.860
- Yeah, you got to eat it.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.446
Hope nobody remembers your on-air

18:34.530 --> 18:36.782
bacchanal of boisterous buffoonery

18:36.866 --> 18:38.575
'cause Pruit wants to meet you.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.036
And Leona says he wants to be charmed.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.413
-What do I do?
-Be the charming one.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.166
-And what do you do?
-Clean up when she goes berserk.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.960
I do not go berserk,

18:49.045 --> 18:52.047
you addle-minded bit of American tripe.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.842
This is a sad day for dignity.

18:55.927 --> 18:57.052
I'll need a dress.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.893
This is the part I keep tripping on.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.354
- What's that?
- I'm still looking at your contract.

19:08.064 --> 19:11.191
45K. 45 large, my young friend.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.360
45 Grover Clevelands.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.070
Grover Cleveland's on the $1,000 bill?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.279
Back when we printed them.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.907
They're not in circulation anymore,
but imagine 45 of them.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.701
That'll give you a sense of
my annual salary beginning Monday.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.079
It's not Jim Harper money,
but it'll pay the rent.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.914
As long as I don't pay any other bills.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.707
It's more than 45 with the incentives.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.042
I know, but I'm not counting my chickens.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.878
-Do you feel like...
-Just my Clevelands.

19:34.590 --> 19:35.632
Okay.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.594
-What were you gonna say?
-Nothing.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.389
-What?
-The incentives.

19:43.266 --> 19:45.809
James, they're not incentives,
they're bonuses.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.269
-For page views.
-Yeah.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.855
The more page views you get,
the more money you're paid.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.774
Welcome to capitalism.
We're happy to have you.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.526
They're bonuses, they're not incentives.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.861
-Hallie, look.
-What?

19:55.945 --> 19:58.280
-If you're okay with it, be okay with it.
-I am.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.574
If you were, then you wouldn't need
to call it something else.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.118
It says bonuses right there.
I'm not the one calling it something else.

20:03.786 --> 20:05.370
If you're writing about a cabinet secretary

20:05.454 --> 20:07.372
who testified in front
of the House Oversight Committee,

20:07.456 --> 20:10.584
are you more likely to write
about the content of the testimony

20:10.668 --> 20:13.545
or "Cabinet Secretary Blasts Darrell Issa"?

20:14.130 --> 20:16.381
-Your hero is Will McAvoy, right?
-He's getting there.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.842
-Your hero is Ed Murrow, right?
-Yeah.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.219
Will is paid millions of dollars a year

20:21.304 --> 20:23.430
and Murrow was paid
the equivalent of millions of dollars a year

20:23.514 --> 20:26.141
for the same reason
anyone in the private sector is paid anything,

20:26.267 --> 20:27.893
their ability to make money for other people.

20:27.977 --> 20:29.895
Will doesn't get paid per view or per story.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.814
That's either heart-stopping naiveté or denial.

20:33.149 --> 20:36.026
Our rundown meetings
don't include a discussion of what's grabby.

20:36.110 --> 20:38.445
And after a week of covering Boston,
you're now in fourth place.

20:38.529 --> 20:41.031
And Charlie makes sure we don't care.
That's my point.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.575
I understand how market forces
work in the news,

20:43.659 --> 20:46.077
but journalists have always been
the people pushing back against them.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.746
And now you're being incentivized to...

20:47.830 --> 20:50.165
My incentives are no different
than a reporter at The New York Times.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.876
If those reporters were being paid
per person reading their story,

20:52.960 --> 20:54.669
the front page of the Times
would look a lot different.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.087
And because it doesn't look a lot different,

20:56.172 --> 20:57.839
there are a lot fewer people
reading their stories.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.175
Who, Hallie, gives a genuine shit

21:00.259 --> 21:03.094
how many people are reading a story
if the story is hyped?

21:03.179 --> 21:05.013
Someone who gets paid per page view.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.142
Your confidence in my integrity

21:09.226 --> 21:11.227
moves me in ways
I don't even know what to do.

21:11.354 --> 21:12.354
Don't take this job.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.522
This is an exciting startup
founded by people...

21:14.649 --> 21:17.192
-Who are self-serving tools.
-That's exactly what they say about you.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.070
And you don't think that has something to do
with why they want to hire you?

21:20.154 --> 21:22.447
Someone who just got fired from ACN

21:22.531 --> 21:23.823
for tweeting a snarky joke?

21:23.908 --> 21:26.159
I think my talent has something to do
with why they want to hire me.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.411
Of course your talent
is why they want to hire you,

21:28.537 --> 21:30.288
but are you the only talented person
that they interviewed?

21:30.373 --> 21:32.207
I'm the most talented person
that they interviewed.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.334
-I believe that.
-You believe they want to hire me

21:34.418 --> 21:36.086
because I have an ax to grind with ACN,

21:36.170 --> 21:38.672
which, for the 100th time, I do not.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.718
You know a lot of things, Hallie,
because of me.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.680
- You know a lot about Genoa.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.807
You know a lot about
private behavior in the newsroom.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.934
-Look...
-And you know some things about Neal.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.271
Not everything, but you know some things.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.525
And it's really dangerous.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.451
You think I'd tell secrets?
Things you've told me in this room?

22:09.370 --> 22:10.578
What's your bonus again?

22:12.581 --> 22:14.332
-Holy shit.
-I was kidding.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.292
The only way for you
to get out of this conversation alive

22:16.377 --> 22:18.920
is to roll over,
turn off the light, and go to sleep.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.798
-I was kidding.
-Do what I said.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.093
We're not supposed to go to bed mad.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.554
Honey, it would take
a Bradley Fighting Vehicle

22:27.638 --> 22:30.015
to move me to mad
from my current level of furious.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.892
So turn off the fucking light, go to sleep,
and we'll try this again tomorrow.

22:34.562 --> 22:35.603
Okay.

22:36.439 --> 22:37.897
Don't go to sleep. We're gonna talk about this.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.274
Okay.

22:58.461 --> 22:59.586
They should be here any second.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.674
You're the first person
I've ever met named Wyatt.

23:04.759 --> 23:05.759
It's a family name.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.764
How'd you like to have Earp as a last name?

23:11.057 --> 23:13.058
That had to be tough
on the playground, hmm?

23:13.893 --> 23:15.185
Maybe that's how he got so tough.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.146
Am I making you nervous?

23:19.315 --> 23:20.356
No.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.358
Sometimes people get nervous around HR.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.819
Mmm, I don't get nervous.
You know who gets nervous?

23:24.987 --> 23:26.321
- Criminals.

23:26.864 --> 23:28.239
Come on in.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.911
Gary Cooper, Alex Thacker,
this is Wyatt Geary

23:32.995 --> 23:35.163
and he is the new VP
of Human Resources for AWM.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.415
-Please have a seat.
-There are no chairs left.

23:37.541 --> 23:40.085
-Alex, HR received a complaint from you.
-That's right.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.253
And it was kicked
down the chain from Charlie to Mac to me.

23:42.338 --> 23:43.797
So why don't you tell us what happened?

23:44.215 --> 23:46.174
It's in the report I wrote that's in front of you.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.511
Yes, I want them to tell me in their own words.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.513
-Don, it's really nothing.
-I have no doubt.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.098
-It's not nothing.
-Okay.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.100
You asked for 20 seconds of copy for Elliot

23:55.184 --> 23:56.935
on Justin Bieber visiting Anne Frank's house.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.979
Why, you know, in the world would I do that?

24:00.064 --> 24:01.815
Because Bieber
signed the guestbook on his way out

24:01.899 --> 24:03.983
and wrote,
"Hopefully, she would have been a Belieber."

24:04.068 --> 24:06.486
And then you and Elliot got drunk
and you told him you'd give him $100

24:06.570 --> 24:08.947
if he could read the story
off the prompter without laughing.

24:09.031 --> 24:11.449
Once again, this is the new HR rep
for our parent company.

24:11.534 --> 24:14.202
The copy should have been assigned to me,
but Gary assigned it to Stacey.

24:14.537 --> 24:16.329
Once I give it to Gary,
Gary gets to make that call.

24:16.413 --> 24:19.916
Based on merit, not based on who he prefers
to sleep with at any particular moment.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.876
I'm not sleeping
and I've never slept with Stacey.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.295
That may or may not be,
but probably is a lie.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.589
What we know for sure is Gary flirted with me,

24:26.674 --> 24:28.883
hit on me, took me out five times,
slept with me twice,

24:28.968 --> 24:29.968
and then dumped me in a pile

24:30.052 --> 24:31.761
with the rest of the staffers
he's used for his pleasure.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.973
I can't emphasize this enough.
This is the new HR rep.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.307
And I'm fine with all of that.

24:36.392 --> 24:37.809
-So we're cool.
-No.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.311
What I am not fine with is being passed over
for an assignment at work

24:40.396 --> 24:42.397
because I exercised
poor judgment in my personal life.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.482
I gave it to her
because she's better at this kind of thing.

24:44.567 --> 24:45.692
What kind of thing?

24:46.485 --> 24:49.070
The intersection
of pop culture and the Holocaust.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.655
-That might sound crazy.
-It did.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.907
Look, I've gone out
with several of the women in this building.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.618
Maybe you don't understand what HR does.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.579
You're saying Stacey
is a better writer than I am?

24:57.663 --> 24:59.455
-She's a different writer than you.
-Different?

24:59.540 --> 25:01.833
Like "I'm tired of this one,
so I'll try a different one?"

25:01.917 --> 25:04.252
I told Gary to give it to Stacey, all right?
He is covering for me.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.005
I told him to give it to her
because she is a better writer than you are.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.966
Well, what am I supposed to do?

25:10.426 --> 25:11.467
Write better.

25:12.094 --> 25:13.928
That's it. Thank you both.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.138
Thank you.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.938
All right. Close the books on that one.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.525
Fraternization between superiors
and subordinates

25:27.610 --> 25:29.944
exposes the company
to all kinds of problems,

25:30.029 --> 25:32.322
-including the one you just saw.
-And we don't tolerate it.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.908
-You're the EP of the 10:00 hour.
-I am.

25:34.992 --> 25:36.868
Which is sometimes anchored
by Sloan Sabbith.

25:37.328 --> 25:38.328
Yes.

25:38.412 --> 25:42.332
So if you and Sloan Sabbith
were in a relationship,

25:42.416 --> 25:44.918
there's a chance we'd have to move
one of you to a different bureau.

25:45.002 --> 25:47.462
-DC or LA.
-Yeah, but we're not.

25:48.172 --> 25:49.589
-Are you sure about that?
-Am I sure?

25:49.673 --> 25:50.715
-Yes.
-Yes.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.134
Because then lying about it
would make it worse.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.056
Mmm-hmm.

25:58.807 --> 25:59.807
Oh, I can see that.

26:00.267 --> 26:03.102
My predecessor was pretty relaxed
about this kind of thing.

26:03.187 --> 26:06.439
And we're already in a tricky spot
with Will McAvoy marrying his EP.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.274
But no one's gonna mess with Will,

26:08.359 --> 26:12.612
so I guess my point is
if you're going to date a subordinate,

26:12.696 --> 26:13.988
you better have stronger ratings.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.700
Oh, I don't see our ratings going up
any time soon,

26:17.785 --> 26:19.953
so I guess I'll just keep
the company directory in the drawer.

26:20.037 --> 26:21.329
-Okay.
-Okay.

26:21.455 --> 26:23.248
Can you tell me how to get
to Sloan Sabbith's office?

26:23.958 --> 26:25.708
Back to the elevators and it's on 22.

26:26.460 --> 26:27.502
Thank you.

26:28.170 --> 26:29.212
Welcome to the company.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.697
We're not dating.

26:57.533 --> 26:58.866
Okay.

27:05.541 --> 27:06.582
Hey.

27:06.667 --> 27:09.836
"What forms
of alternative energy are real options

27:09.920 --> 27:11.129
"to replace coal and gasoline,

27:11.213 --> 27:14.549
"and why are they taking so long
to assume sizable parts of the marketplace?"

27:14.633 --> 27:16.676
-Great question.
-Yeah, you wrote it.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.511
I thought the idea was to figure out a way

27:18.595 --> 27:20.346
to capture people's attention with the report

27:20.431 --> 27:21.973
and the interview with the head of the EPA.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.726
You said he was the Deputy
Assistant Administrator of the EPA.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.562
So let's be sure
we identify him, you know, right.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.398
Yeah, but I think that's
the least of our problems.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.108
No, it's not. It's just the first of our problems.

27:32.192 --> 27:34.944
And I'm saying the guy has a job and a title
and can we not hype it up?

27:35.029 --> 27:37.613
I have confidence in the graphic,
but where I need your help...

27:37.698 --> 27:38.906
Is in hyping it up.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.909
The air has a very dangerous level
of poison gas in it.

27:42.036 --> 27:44.329
Why do we have to write Will
questions like it's a sex test

27:44.413 --> 27:46.998
in Sex, you know, Magazine or something?

27:47.082 --> 27:48.791
-Sex Magazine?
-Yeah, I couldn't think of a real...

27:48.876 --> 27:51.544
We've switched sides.
Yesterday, you told me I was boring you.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.254
I was wrong.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.715
"China's demand for coal is increasing

27:55.799 --> 27:58.092
"as it continues to urbanize and industrialize,

27:58.177 --> 28:01.054
"but so has its demand
for solar power and wind energy."

28:01.138 --> 28:02.680
-That isn't even a question.
-No, look.

28:03.098 --> 28:05.516
- "Your thoughts?"
- I want to hear his thoughts.

28:07.269 --> 28:09.771
I came over and told you
about the EPA report and

28:09.855 --> 28:12.023
-the interview Friday with Richard Westbrook.
-Yeah.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.816
You told me I was boring you.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.943
I asked for help. You gloated.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.904
And then what?

28:19.865 --> 28:21.532
Did you know there are online news outlets

28:21.617 --> 28:24.577
that offer bonuses to
their reporters for page views?

28:25.537 --> 28:27.330
-Yes.
-I didn't know that.

28:27.790 --> 28:29.832
That's because you live
in the time of King Arthur

28:29.958 --> 28:31.292
along with Don, Will, and Charlie.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.460
I don't live in the time of King Arthur.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.711
You live in the time of King Arthur.

28:33.796 --> 28:37.298
You don't see an immediate danger
in offering cash for trash on a news site?

28:38.801 --> 28:40.635
-I understand.
-Thank you.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.553
You were a dick to Hallie.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.139
-No, I wasn't.
-Tiny bit dicky?

28:45.808 --> 28:47.392
What am I supposed to say
when she comes home

28:47.476 --> 28:49.727
with a contract for a job
at a new website called Carnivore?

28:49.812 --> 28:50.978
Congratulations.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.314
I said congratulations.
I supported her ass off.

28:53.399 --> 28:54.899
-And then?
-I saw the contract.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.401
-And you were a dick.
-I wasn't.

28:56.485 --> 28:58.403
A little bit Dickensian in your special way

28:58.487 --> 29:00.947
that says, "I love you, but you suck."

29:01.615 --> 29:04.325
She got fired. She was humiliated.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.868
And I'm sure you were there for her,

29:05.953 --> 29:08.454
but I'm also 100% certain

29:08.539 --> 29:11.666
there was something in your voice
that said, "You deserved it."

29:16.213 --> 29:17.672
I don't want what I'm about to say

29:17.756 --> 29:19.674
to be misconstrued as agreeing with you,

29:19.758 --> 29:23.678
but I'll try to be conscious of that
and do better.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.014
Good.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.225
Who are you bringing to
the Correspondents' Dinner?

29:29.309 --> 29:32.186
I met a really nice guy
on the train back from Boston.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.105
Guess what he teaches
at Fordham Law School?

29:34.189 --> 29:35.857
-What?
-Ethics.

29:37.234 --> 29:38.943
Leave it to you
to find the only person in the world

29:39.027 --> 29:40.486
who can make money being ethical.

29:40.571 --> 29:41.779
I know.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.700
How did you get
the EPA report and the exclusive interview?

30:06.638 --> 30:08.598
This was really the best place to meet?

30:08.682 --> 30:10.641
-Yeah. Were you followed?
-No.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.059
-You were followed.
-By who?

30:12.144 --> 30:14.270
Me, just to show you that I can.

30:14.396 --> 30:15.396
Just stand up a second.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.982
You asked for the meeting.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.275
Please.

30:25.157 --> 30:28.659
We've known each other
since we were too young to rent a car.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.495
That's the only reason I'm here.

30:32.748 --> 30:36.250
If anyone knew I was, I'd be asked
to hand over my badge and my gun

30:36.335 --> 30:38.669
and I would never
in my life be able to get a job

30:38.754 --> 30:40.171
that required trustworthiness.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.632
Can you think of a job that doesn't?

30:43.759 --> 30:45.426
-No.
-So there we are.

30:47.721 --> 30:50.181
We found some
compelling evidence on Neal's hard drive

30:50.265 --> 30:53.184
that he helped his source
transfer the docs from the SIPRNet.

30:57.648 --> 30:58.773
How compelling?

31:00.943 --> 31:02.735
If you're able to contact him...

31:02.819 --> 31:04.237
I don't know if you are.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.281
But if someone is able to contact him,

31:07.366 --> 31:08.866
they should tell him to come in.

31:10.786 --> 31:13.496
He needs a lawyer and he needs to cooperate.

31:14.623 --> 31:16.707
To commit the crime you're suggesting,

31:16.792 --> 31:19.585
Neal would have had to have had
knowledge he was committing a crime,

31:19.670 --> 31:21.629
knowledge he couldn't possibly have had

31:21.713 --> 31:23.089
when the source contacted him.

31:23.173 --> 31:24.715
A reporter you'd be willing to work with

31:24.800 --> 31:27.301
can't tell the difference
between a credible source and a fugazi?

31:27.427 --> 31:30.346
Yes, I'd be willing
to work with Dan Rather and CBS News.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.723
We don't want Neal.

31:32.808 --> 31:35.851
We want... We have to have his source.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.147
This is a bad guy.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.817
And what are you gonna do
to Neal to get his name?

31:43.277 --> 31:45.027
We're not gonna throw a bag over his head.

31:45.112 --> 31:48.364
But you are gonna threaten him
with conspiracy to commit espionage.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.824
It's not gonna be an idle threat.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.827
Our experts were very impressed

31:52.911 --> 31:54.453
with his technical sophistication.

31:55.789 --> 31:57.748
You can bring him in

31:57.833 --> 31:59.208
or we can kick his door down.

32:07.509 --> 32:09.802
Okay.

32:12.848 --> 32:14.098
You know you just revealed to me

32:14.182 --> 32:16.434
that you knew he helped
with the document transfer.

32:16.810 --> 32:17.852
Yeah.

32:19.605 --> 32:20.605
Trust.

32:43.879 --> 32:45.880
Thanks for meeting me so late.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.131
What's going on?

32:49.468 --> 32:52.553
I want to ask you something
and I want you to tell me the truth,

32:52.638 --> 32:55.514
but I don't want you to tell me
any more than you're asked.

32:59.770 --> 33:00.895
All right.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.814
Is anyone in touch with Neal?

33:05.067 --> 33:07.568
Through an uncle who talks to his cousin?
Anything?

33:15.535 --> 33:17.203
Yes, somebody's in touch with Neal.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.914
Get a message to him to come in.

33:22.459 --> 33:24.335
Friday night in DC at Main Justice.

33:24.795 --> 33:26.837
He'll have immunity at the meeting.

33:27.923 --> 33:28.964
What about after the meeting?

33:32.886 --> 33:35.805
No reporter's ever been charged
under the Espionage Act.

33:46.692 --> 33:47.692
All right.

33:51.822 --> 33:52.905
Okay.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.625
Anzor Tsarnaev, the father of...

34:04.710 --> 34:06.460
- Stand by, G7 and 7A.
- Standing.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.130
<i>...will be traveling from Russia</i>
<i>to the US this week.</i>

34:09.214 --> 34:10.881
<i>Meanwhile, Jahar remains hospitalized</i>

34:10.966 --> 34:12.174
<i>and no date yet has been set</i>
<i>for his arraignment.</i>

34:12.259 --> 34:13.300
Go 7.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.387
Today the federal government
released a startling finding

34:16.471 --> 34:19.223
on the level of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere.

34:19.307 --> 34:21.642
<i>We'll have EPA Deputy Assistant</i>
<i>Administrator Richard...</i>

34:21.727 --> 34:23.144
- Ready SOT-4.
- Ready.

34:23.270 --> 34:26.021
<i>- First, ACN's Maggie Jordan filed this report.</i>
Go SOT-4.

34:26.314 --> 34:28.232
A grave warning today
<i>from scientists</i>

34:28.316 --> 34:31.610
<i>at the National Oceanic</i>
<i>and Atmospheric Administration.</i>

34:31.778 --> 34:34.905
<i>The world has passed</i>
<i>a long-feared milestone with the...</i>

34:34.990 --> 34:36.824
-Mr. Westbrook?
-Yeah.

34:37.617 --> 34:39.910
-I'll take you to the studio now.
-Okay.

34:40.078 --> 34:43.789
<i>400 parts per million reaching</i>
<i>a concentration not seen on the Earth</i>

34:43.874 --> 34:45.458
<i>for millions of years.</i>

34:45.584 --> 34:47.960
<i>Scientists took this reading...</i>

34:48.128 --> 34:49.211
Will, we're running light.

34:49.296 --> 34:51.255
Can you tease the interview out
another 40 seconds?

34:51.339 --> 34:52.381
Yeah.

34:54.468 --> 34:55.843
30 seconds.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.221
<i>-How are you? I'm Will.</i>
<i>-Nice to meet you.</i>

34:59.681 --> 35:00.931
So there won't be any hard questions.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.975
I'm just gonna ask you
to expand on the report.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.060
Pretend you're an expert witness
and I'm your lawyer.

35:05.145 --> 35:06.562
-Sounds good.
-In 10.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.856
- Here we go.
- Stand by, camera one.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.817
<i>...the 450 parts per million</i>
<i>will soon be crossed.</i>

35:11.902 --> 35:14.987
<i>The question remains, how will we respond?</i>

35:15.530 --> 35:17.573
<i>And joining us now in studio</i>
<i>is Richard Westbrook,</i>

35:17.657 --> 35:20.117
<i>Deputy Assistant Administrator of the EPA.</i>

35:20.202 --> 35:21.202
<i>-Welcome.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

35:21.286 --> 35:23.913
Mr. Westbrook,
you've spent most of your professional career

35:23.997 --> 35:26.123
as a climate scientist in the public sector.

35:26.208 --> 35:29.335
Yes, 10 years
as a supervisory management analyst

35:29.419 --> 35:31.462
in the Office of Environmental Information.

35:31.546 --> 35:34.089
And before that, I was a program specialist

35:34.216 --> 35:35.966
in the EPA's Resource Management Division.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.552
And you have a PhD in climate science
from Stanford.

35:38.720 --> 35:41.305
Yes, and another in chemistry
with a masters in biology.

35:41.389 --> 35:44.517
Okay. Tell us about the findings
in the report that was just released.

35:44.601 --> 35:48.479
The latest measurements
taken at Mauna Loa in Hawaii

35:48.563 --> 35:51.816
indicate a CO2 level of 400 parts per million.

35:52.192 --> 35:53.818
Just so we know what we're talking about,

35:53.902 --> 35:55.820
if you were a doctor and we were the patient,

35:55.904 --> 35:59.698
what's your prognosis?
A thousand years? Two thousand years?

35:59.783 --> 36:01.700
A person has already been born who will die

36:01.785 --> 36:03.911
due to catastrophic failure of the planet.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.373
What did he just say?

36:09.501 --> 36:11.585
Okay, can you, uh, expand on that?

36:11.920 --> 36:13.087
Sure.

36:13.547 --> 36:16.590
Um, the last time there was
this much CO2 in the air,

36:16.716 --> 36:18.801
the oceans were 80 feet higher
than they are now.

36:19.219 --> 36:20.553
Two things you should know.

36:20.846 --> 36:24.223
Half the world's population
lives within 120 miles of an ocean.

36:25.225 --> 36:27.935
-And the other?
-Humans can't breathe under water.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.688
<i>You're saying the situation's dire?</i>

36:30.772 --> 36:32.439
<i>Not exactly. Um...</i>

36:33.108 --> 36:35.568
<i>Your house is burning to the ground,</i>
<i>the situation's dire.</i>

36:35.652 --> 36:39.446
<i>Your house has already burned to the ground,</i>
<i>the situation's over.</i>

36:39.865 --> 36:42.116
So what can we do to reverse this?

36:42.284 --> 36:43.576
-Oh, there's a lot we could do.
-Good.

36:43.660 --> 36:46.871
If it were 20 years ago or even 10 years ago.

36:46.955 --> 36:49.081
But now, no.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.711
<i>Can you make an analogy</i>
<i>that might help us understand?</i>

36:53.795 --> 36:57.339
Sure. Um, it's as if
you're sitting in your car, uh,

36:57.424 --> 37:00.801
in your garage,
with the engine running and the door closed,

37:00.886 --> 37:03.387
and you've slipped into unconsciousness.

37:03.471 --> 37:06.307
And that... That's it.

37:06.808 --> 37:08.809
What if someone comes and opens the door?

37:08.894 --> 37:11.312
-You're already dead.
-What if the person got there in time?

37:11.897 --> 37:13.105
-You'd be saved.
-Okay.

37:13.189 --> 37:16.525
<i>So now what's the CO2 equivalent</i>
<i>of the getting there on time?</i>

37:17.027 --> 37:19.028
<i>Shutting off the car 20 years ago.</i>

37:21.156 --> 37:22.823
You sound like you're saying it's hopeless.

37:23.491 --> 37:24.575
Yeah.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.494
Is that the, uh,
administration's position or yours?

37:27.787 --> 37:29.955
<i>There isn't a position on this</i>
<i>any more than</i>

37:30.040 --> 37:33.208
<i>there's a position</i>
<i>on the temperature at which water boils.</i>

37:34.002 --> 37:37.046
<i>The administration... Let me try to...</i>
<i>Your administration...</i>

37:37.130 --> 37:39.548
And don't forget I need you to stretch 40.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.550
<i>...clean coal, nuclear power,</i>

37:41.635 --> 37:45.721
<i>raising fuel economy standards</i>
<i>and building a more efficient electrical grid.</i>

37:45.931 --> 37:47.348
-Yes.
-And?

37:47.807 --> 37:49.183
That would have been great.

37:50.352 --> 37:51.977
Let's see if we can't find a better spin.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.687
People are starting their weekends.

37:53.980 --> 37:58.400
The report says we can release
565 more gigatons of CO2

37:58.526 --> 38:00.027
without the effects being calamitous.

38:00.153 --> 38:01.987
It says we can only release 565 gigatons.

38:02.072 --> 38:04.198
So, what if we only release 564?

38:04.658 --> 38:07.284
Well, then we would
have a reasonable shot at some form

38:07.369 --> 38:09.495
of dystopian, post-apocalyptic life.

38:09.579 --> 38:12.206
<i>But the carbon dioxide in the oil</i>

38:12.290 --> 38:16.752
<i>that we've already leased is 2,795 gigatons.</i>

38:17.545 --> 38:18.629
<i>So...</i>

38:21.007 --> 38:22.174
<i>What would all this look like?</i>

38:22.634 --> 38:25.719
Well, mass migrations,
food and water shortages,

38:26.221 --> 38:29.473
<i>spread of deadly disease, endless wildfires.</i>

38:29.557 --> 38:31.892
Way too many to keep under control.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.312
Storms that have the power to level cities,

38:35.397 --> 38:38.357
blacken out the sky,
and create permanent darkness.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.443
Are you gonna get
in trouble for saying this publically?

38:42.153 --> 38:43.153
Who cares?

38:43.238 --> 38:45.656
Mr. Westbrook, we want to inform people,

38:45.740 --> 38:47.366
<i>but we don't want to alarm them.</i>

38:47.450 --> 38:49.743
<i>Can you give us a reason to be optimistic?</i>

38:50.996 --> 38:54.498
Well, that's the thing, Will.
Americans are optimistic by nature.

38:54.916 --> 38:58.252
And if we face this problem head on,

38:58.378 --> 39:00.546
if we listen to our best scientists,

39:00.630 --> 39:03.924
and act decisively and passionately,

39:05.343 --> 39:07.011
I still don't see any way we can survive.

39:07.095 --> 39:10.139
Okay, Richard Westbrook,
Deputy Assistant Administrator of the EPA.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.016
<i>-Thank you for joining us.</i>
<i>-Thanks for having me.</i>

39:12.100 --> 39:14.435
This is News Night.
<i>We'll be back right after this.</i>

39:15.895 --> 39:17.771
- Herb?

39:17.897 --> 39:19.023
Yeah, yeah. We're out.

39:35.123 --> 39:37.332
Is this a tactic, making us wait?

39:38.334 --> 39:39.585
Have you done this?

39:40.712 --> 39:43.756
Look, US, US, US, US.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.924
We're on the same team.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.054
But, yes, it's a tactic.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.973
When we meet Pruit tomorrow night,
let's not mention this.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.558
Oh, he's gonna find out sooner or later.

39:54.642 --> 39:56.560
I want it to be later, after his check clears.

40:07.989 --> 40:09.698
-Maybe he's...
-Don't get up.

40:10.742 --> 40:11.867
I'm Barry Lasenthal,

40:11.951 --> 40:14.328
Assistant Attorney General
for National Security.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.122
-You're Rebecca Halliday?
-Yes, sir.

40:17.207 --> 40:19.458
You've let your clients know
there'll be no record of this meeting?

40:19.542 --> 40:21.001
- Yes.
- I wish there was.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.587
-What's that?
-I said I wish there was.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.756
Do you mind if I ask why
you're sitting so far away?

40:25.882 --> 40:27.925
I do mind.
Would you like to register a complaint?

40:29.594 --> 40:30.969
Reporters having their asses

40:31.054 --> 40:32.638
hauled into the Justice Department
doesn't sit well...

40:32.722 --> 40:35.182
I'll see that your concerns
make it straight to the children

40:35.266 --> 40:38.310
of undercover agents who've been killed
when their identities were made known.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.189
You're bringing out
your queen a little early, aren't you?

40:42.273 --> 40:45.484
Mr. Lasenthal, our intention
is to work with the FBI

40:45.568 --> 40:48.654
or any relevant officials
as we've always done in the past

40:48.780 --> 40:51.448
to ensure the story is responsibly reported.

40:52.325 --> 40:53.617
But it'll be reported.

40:54.702 --> 40:56.036
Not my pig, not my farm.

40:57.664 --> 40:58.789
I don't know that expression.

40:58.873 --> 41:01.083
He's saying someone else
is handling the story.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.336
See, Will is from Nebraska, too.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.964
But I wasn't recruited by Nebraska,

41:07.048 --> 41:09.383
so I played fullback at A&M.

41:10.135 --> 41:13.887
And we lost to Nebraska
all four years I was there.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.892
The story is someone else's concern.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.687
But I can tell you
if you report news that was gathered illegally,

41:21.771 --> 41:24.398
you'll face criminal fines
in an amount that will bankrupt you.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.024
They understand that. Let's begin.

41:26.109 --> 41:28.068
My problem is what's on that flash drive.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.862
-Let's begin.
-Are you running this meeting?

41:29.946 --> 41:32.906
- When I need to.
- How about we cool it, okay?

41:33.449 --> 41:35.492
You want to see
what information we can give you

41:35.577 --> 41:38.245
without us naming the source, and that's fair.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.164
But any conversation has to start

41:40.248 --> 41:43.292
with our knowing that Neal Sampat
is safe from prosecution.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.128
He is safe from prosecution.

41:46.212 --> 41:47.629
We need that in writing.

41:47.714 --> 41:50.174
Neal Sampat is in Maracaibo, Venezuela.

41:54.095 --> 41:55.137
He flew there yesterday

41:55.221 --> 41:57.973
from Calgary International Airport
by way of Cuba.

41:58.308 --> 42:00.601
Not for nothing,
but this is a building full of lawyers

42:00.768 --> 42:03.353
who'd have no problem
making that look an awful lot to a jury

42:03.438 --> 42:05.772
like tradecraft
from a dark-skinned young man.

42:06.608 --> 42:08.025
Now maybe it's just a coincidence,

42:08.109 --> 42:10.068
but in all three of those pictures,

42:10.153 --> 42:11.945
he's looking over his shoulder a little.

42:12.614 --> 42:14.031
He'll be doing that for the rest of his life.

42:14.115 --> 42:15.115
That's his punishment.

42:15.617 --> 42:16.992
Punishment for what?

42:17.076 --> 42:19.620
I don't believe what... His punishment?

42:19.746 --> 42:21.079
Punishment for what?

42:22.207 --> 42:24.041
We're a couple of inches away from being able

42:24.125 --> 42:26.418
to show he induced his source
to commit a felony.

42:26.502 --> 42:28.212
You're a long way off from demonstrating

42:28.296 --> 42:30.172
that he had knowledge
he was committing a crime.

42:30.465 --> 42:33.800
Closer now that he's vacationing
in a country with no extradition treaty.

42:33.885 --> 42:36.261
Jesus Christ,
you scared the shit out of this kid.

42:36.346 --> 42:38.764
I've seen some things, you know?

42:38.848 --> 42:40.557
I have been around,

42:40.642 --> 42:43.810
but we've got to work
on getting him back now.

42:43.895 --> 42:45.479
Counsel, ask your questions.

42:49.943 --> 42:51.985
What time did Mr. Sampat first make contact?

42:52.487 --> 42:55.030
Monday evening, April 15.
A week ago Monday.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.156
Where was he at the time?

42:56.282 --> 42:57.991
His desk at ACN's New York bureau.

42:58.076 --> 43:01.495
The source made contact with Mr. Sampat,
not the other way.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.455
My next question was how was contact made.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.999
The source contacted Neal over ACN.com

43:06.084 --> 43:07.709
and asked for his encryption key.

43:07.794 --> 43:09.795
-And what was his response?
-To give it to him.

43:09.879 --> 43:12.172
And then the source asked for a higher level
of encryption?

43:13.258 --> 43:14.675
I won't answer that at this time.

43:17.053 --> 43:19.096
Did Mr. Sampat tell you
the name of the source?

43:19.180 --> 43:21.265
-Yes.
-He tell you anything else about the source?

43:21.349 --> 43:23.433
-Yes.
-Will you tell us the name of the source?

43:23.518 --> 43:24.518
No, sir.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.103
Will you tell us anything else
about the source?

43:26.187 --> 43:27.187
No.

43:27.772 --> 43:29.189
Well, you've got a problem.

43:30.316 --> 43:32.317
For one thing,
it's a myth that the First Amendment

43:32.402 --> 43:35.362
protects you in situations like this.
Branzburg v. Hayes...

43:35.446 --> 43:37.990
Justice Powell made it clear
the exception exists.

43:38.074 --> 43:39.199
Not clear enough.

43:40.201 --> 43:43.495
A laptop computer was purchased
with your American Express card

43:43.579 --> 43:46.540
at the Best Buy at 44th and 5th in Manhattan,

43:47.125 --> 43:50.669
but the signature on the receipt
doesn't match your handwriting.

43:50.837 --> 43:52.838
You gave your credit card to Neal Sampat

43:52.922 --> 43:54.715
to buy an air-gapped computer, right?

43:54.799 --> 43:56.341
This ends our cooperation.

43:56.426 --> 43:59.970
What I think, is this is exactly
where you were going.

44:00.054 --> 44:04.266
See, what I think is that,
either to protect Neal, or be a hero, or both,

44:04.892 --> 44:07.894
you engineered this whole thing
so that Neal was cleared out

44:08.062 --> 44:09.646
and you were left holding the bag.

44:12.734 --> 44:14.735
But you forgot what else was in the bag.

44:16.529 --> 44:17.821
This receipt.

44:21.034 --> 44:22.075
Who's the source, Will?

44:23.453 --> 44:24.995
No one has to know you gave him up.

44:25.997 --> 44:27.748
No one has to know it was you.

44:32.754 --> 44:34.921
-I'll tell you what, Mr. Lasenthal.
-Yeah?

44:36.174 --> 44:38.675
-You're bad at this.
-Is that right?

44:40.261 --> 44:42.220
You come in here like Brian Dennehy.

44:42.305 --> 44:45.307
You're at the other end of the table
'cause it's some Jedi mind shit

44:45.391 --> 44:47.434
you were taught
at a three-day seminar in Hilton Head.

44:48.019 --> 44:50.228
I was the one most apt to cooperate.

44:50.313 --> 44:51.897
The agents must have reported that to you.

44:51.981 --> 44:53.440
That's the signal I was sending you.

44:53.858 --> 44:56.526
But you insulted our lawyer
and you insulted my producer

44:56.611 --> 44:59.488
who happens to be my fiancée,
which you also know.

44:59.572 --> 45:01.198
And you insulted Charlie Skinner,

45:01.282 --> 45:03.867
which your people would have told you
wasn't gonna make any of us happy.

45:03.951 --> 45:05.243
And you threatened to bankrupt us

45:05.328 --> 45:08.538
and to have the same PR operation
that got 38 people killed

45:08.623 --> 45:09.790
turn Neal into a radical.

45:11.626 --> 45:14.336
Yeah, I moved the pieces
so they'd end up looking like this.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.588
Except Neal's supposed to be in a Super 8

45:16.672 --> 45:19.049
in Bayonne, New Jersey,
and not South America.

45:19.759 --> 45:22.260
And I did it because, while I have no doubt

45:22.345 --> 45:24.846
that you'd shake Neal up and down
until he gave you the source,

45:24.931 --> 45:26.473
which would never happen,

45:27.809 --> 45:29.559
your jaw-dropping government overreach

45:29.644 --> 45:32.729
simply won't extend
to putting a TV star in jail for contempt.

45:34.482 --> 45:37.109
You bungled this,
and I can't help you anymore.

45:41.823 --> 45:42.989
That's it.

45:50.623 --> 45:52.541
I fucking hated losing to Nebraska.

45:53.668 --> 45:55.127
I'd have thought you'd have gotten used to it.

46:03.886 --> 46:06.179
<i>I... Look, I get it.</i>

46:07.140 --> 46:10.642
<i>These days,</i>
<i>I look in the mirror and I have to admit,</i>

46:10.726 --> 46:13.895
<i>I'm not the strapping</i>
<i>young Muslim Socialist that I used to be.</i>

46:19.861 --> 46:21.278
<i>Time passes,</i>

46:22.697 --> 46:24.197
<i>you get a little gray.</i>

46:33.166 --> 46:34.291
Hey.

46:35.376 --> 46:37.627
Uh, Hallie Shea, Jim Harper,

46:37.712 --> 46:39.337
this is Jack Spaniel.

46:39.422 --> 46:41.047
-Nice to meet you.
-It's nice to meet you.

46:41.549 --> 46:42.716
How'd you two meet?

46:42.800 --> 46:45.051
It was on a train coming back from Boston.
Uh...

46:45.470 --> 46:47.095
Maggie overheard a man talking to a reporter,

46:47.180 --> 46:49.264
but passed on the story
because she didn't like

46:49.348 --> 46:51.516
that she slid down in her seat to get it.

46:51.601 --> 46:53.727
The man she overheard was
so impressed by her ethics

46:53.811 --> 46:56.271
- that he gave her an exclusive.

46:56.397 --> 46:57.481
I teach ethics,

46:57.565 --> 46:59.733
so I was vocationally
attracted to the situation.

47:00.735 --> 47:03.487
And the story you got in exchange
was that the world was coming to an end.

47:03.571 --> 47:05.238
Pretty good for a Friday.

47:05.323 --> 47:07.115
It almost sounds
like something you read in a tabloid.

47:07.283 --> 47:09.493
Hey, nothing's wrong with tabloids.

47:09.577 --> 47:10.911
Elvis ever comes back,

47:10.995 --> 47:13.288
you're not gonna read about it
<i>in The Washington Post.</i>

47:13.372 --> 47:14.581
Good point.

47:15.416 --> 47:17.334
We are gonna get something to eat.

47:17.418 --> 47:18.543
Oh, okay.

47:22.173 --> 47:24.299
Was that for me, the ethics parable?

47:24.383 --> 47:26.009
I hadn't heard that story until just now.

47:26.093 --> 47:27.844
Uh, Charlie wants to see
everyone in five minutes

47:27.929 --> 47:29.304
in the kitchen in the west side of the building.

47:29.388 --> 47:30.472
Okay.

47:33.309 --> 47:35.393
You're the one who asked how they met.

47:40.066 --> 47:43.276
I sent in at least three jokes
that would have killed.

47:43.903 --> 47:46.029
Those guys never use my jokes.
You know why?

47:46.447 --> 47:48.156
-I do.
-Speech writer snobbery.

47:48.616 --> 47:49.783
-I think it's something else.
-Mmm.

47:50.409 --> 47:52.285
-Taste this. It's fantastic.
-What is it?

47:53.663 --> 47:54.788
I don't believe it. He's here.

47:55.373 --> 47:57.082
-Sir, you really have to try this.
-Mmm.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.501
-Oh.
-Delicious, right?

48:01.837 --> 48:04.214
-Don, Sloan.
-Mmm.

48:04.632 --> 48:06.883
What a coincidence seeing you together.

48:06.968 --> 48:08.218
Not really. The whole staff is here.

48:08.302 --> 48:09.803
It's a little bit more unusual that you're here.

48:10.263 --> 48:11.263
I'm a vice president

48:11.347 --> 48:13.807
at the seventh largest media company
in the world.

48:13.933 --> 48:15.642
-Wyatt thinks we're dating.
-You and him?

48:15.726 --> 48:17.394
-Me and you.
-Are you serious?

48:17.478 --> 48:19.479
-Yep.
-Don and me?

48:20.314 --> 48:22.399
Have you Googled my romantic history?

48:22.483 --> 48:24.234
I date guys called Mr. Chairman.

48:24.318 --> 48:27.112
I date first round draft picks,
high second round if it's a skill position.

48:27.196 --> 48:29.239
You think I'm dating the EP
of a 10:00 PM newscast

48:29.323 --> 48:31.992
that barely outrates a rerun of Just Shoot Me?

48:33.369 --> 48:36.329
I absolutely do. And I'm gonna nail you.

48:36.664 --> 48:38.039
Charlie wants to see everyone in the kitchen

48:38.124 --> 48:40.542
in the west end
of the building in five minutes.

48:40.626 --> 48:41.668
Okay.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.004
See ya.

48:47.842 --> 48:50.176
-Was that too much before?
-That was way, way too much.

48:52.346 --> 48:53.430
Excuse me.

48:53.848 --> 48:56.057
Excuse me, do you happen to have any
Schweppes Bitter Lemon?

48:56.142 --> 48:57.392
-Yes, ma'am.
-You have Schweppes?

48:57.476 --> 49:00.604
-Uh, it's Canada Dry, I think.
-My boss has to have Schweppes.

49:01.230 --> 49:03.898
Do you happen to know if there's
a nearby liquor store or a grocery store?

49:03.983 --> 49:05.191
I think you'd have to ask someone else.

49:05.568 --> 49:07.110
They can carbonate lemon juice.

49:07.194 --> 49:08.695
Your boss won't know the difference.

49:08.821 --> 49:11.197
-He will.
-He sounds like a dream come true.

49:11.532 --> 49:13.783
-He's actually a...
-Charlie Skinner?

49:13.868 --> 49:15.577
-Mr. Pruit.
-Lucas.

49:16.162 --> 49:18.872
-You're the man I've been waiting for.
-I looked for you in the ballroom.

49:19.373 --> 49:21.249
I had to step out for a while to take a call.

49:21.334 --> 49:22.959
-I knew I'd see you here.
-It's no problem.

49:23.044 --> 49:24.669
I just looked for you in the ballroom.

49:24.754 --> 49:26.212
-I'm sorry about that.
-No, no need.

49:26.380 --> 49:28.632
Like I said, I had to take a call
and I knew I'd see you here.

49:28.716 --> 49:30.592
-Not a problem.
-What are you drinking?

49:31.385 --> 49:34.220
Unflavored Absolut Vodka
with a capful of Schweppes Bitter Lemon

49:34.305 --> 49:35.597
poured over ice in a rocks glass.

49:35.681 --> 49:37.641
They don't have Schweppes Bitter Lemon.

49:37.725 --> 49:40.685
It eludes me why that
should ever be the case, you know?

49:40.770 --> 49:43.521
-It just eludes me.
-I'll go out to a store.

49:43.856 --> 49:44.898
-Gwen.
-Yeah?

49:44.982 --> 49:46.691
I'm not insane. Just enjoy the party.

49:47.401 --> 49:48.610
Thank you.

49:52.031 --> 49:53.323
I don't think she's gonna work out.

49:53.407 --> 49:55.867
We'll make sure our refrigerators are stocked.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.577
Leona told me
I'd be meeting you in the ballroom

49:57.662 --> 49:59.204
and then I'd be talking
to you here at the party.

50:00.706 --> 50:01.790
That was the plan.

50:01.874 --> 50:04.209
But then, unfortunately, I had to take a call...

50:04.293 --> 50:06.211
Work related? The call.

50:08.172 --> 50:09.464
Was the call...

50:10.549 --> 50:12.842
No, it was my daughter, as a matter of fact.

50:12.968 --> 50:14.636
So we've met and now we're here

50:14.720 --> 50:16.137
and I'm looking forward to talking.

50:16.347 --> 50:18.765
As I understand it, you're our last best hope

50:18.849 --> 50:20.308
for the network to stay on the air.

50:21.018 --> 50:23.353
If I was a man with no choices, I'd kill myself.

50:24.271 --> 50:26.564
Well, I guess that means I have a choice, so...

50:26.899 --> 50:28.900
Would you like to talk
about my intentions for the network?

50:29.944 --> 50:31.444
Yes, sir, I would.

51:09.316 --> 51:10.400
My name is Lilly.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.194
-Pleased to meet you.
-You're MacKenzie?

51:13.279 --> 51:14.320
ACN.

51:15.197 --> 51:17.615
You're the one who decides
if and when to air a story?

51:18.659 --> 51:20.910
I'm sorry, can I ask what this is about?

51:20.995 --> 51:22.495
I spoke to someone who works for you.

51:23.330 --> 51:24.456
About what?

51:26.500 --> 51:27.667
I spoke to Neal.

51:35.342 --> 51:37.844
-Are you saying...
-I'm the source.

51:47.855 --> 51:48.897
Prove that.

51:50.775 --> 51:54.027
38 people died in a riot in Kundu
because of disinformation we planted.

51:54.153 --> 51:55.278
-Okay.
-Three of them...

51:56.655 --> 51:58.448
-I sent Neal 27,000...
-Stop talking.

52:00.743 --> 52:03.036
-Let me tell you what we're about.
-Let me tell you what I'm about.

52:04.205 --> 52:05.580
Disruption.

52:06.332 --> 52:07.874
I can see fear in your eyes.

52:07.958 --> 52:09.209
There almost always is.

52:09.376 --> 52:12.670
What's an example of disruption
as it would apply to a news network?

52:12.755 --> 52:15.298
User-generated content.
Crowdsourcing the news.

52:15.841 --> 52:18.176
I'll tell you, Lucas, we just had in Boston...

52:18.260 --> 52:21.095
Boston was a bad instance of crowdsourcing,

52:21.222 --> 52:22.472
but it was still disruption.

52:22.723 --> 52:24.974
Why one channel? Why not 500?

52:25.142 --> 52:26.434
With no cost for content.

52:26.560 --> 52:29.813
No cost for content on the other 499?
I'm just trying...

52:29.897 --> 52:32.315
I'm not talking about guys
with head-cams in Syria.

52:32.399 --> 52:35.652
I don't know. Maybe I am. A disaster channel.

52:35.736 --> 52:37.737
A stalker channel. I just did three. Now you.

52:38.739 --> 52:41.407
A channel where professionals
investigate and report the news.

52:41.492 --> 52:43.993
Danny Glover just came to mind.

52:44.078 --> 52:45.703
We could have a channel

52:45.788 --> 52:48.706
devoted to people
who are stalking Danny Glover.

52:48.791 --> 52:50.375
-You think I'm kidding.
-No, I don't.

52:50.793 --> 52:52.585
-They're gathering.
-Thanks.

52:54.547 --> 52:55.964
I have to step away for a few minutes,

52:56.048 --> 52:57.966
but I'm looking forward
to talking more about this.

52:58.050 --> 52:59.843
No, you're not, but you will anyway.

53:00.970 --> 53:02.095
Yeah.

53:09.103 --> 53:12.522
You're at a party with nothing
but reporters and government officials.

53:12.606 --> 53:14.274
They don't know they're looking for me.

53:14.942 --> 53:16.234
Why hasn't the story aired yet?

53:17.111 --> 53:19.821
You said we. "We planted disinformation."

53:19.905 --> 53:21.614
-You work for BCD?
-Yeah.

53:21.699 --> 53:23.741
They're looking for someone
inside the Pentagon.

53:23.826 --> 53:25.076
When is the story running?

53:25.744 --> 53:27.745
-It's going to be reported.
-It's been a week.

53:28.455 --> 53:30.874
We promised some people
we'd hold a moment.

53:30.958 --> 53:32.375
The government.

53:32.459 --> 53:35.128
We have to work with them
on national security.

53:35.254 --> 53:38.047
They're gonna tell you
everything is national security.

53:39.508 --> 53:42.051
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

53:42.136 --> 53:44.846
If I don't see the story
on your air by Wednesday,

53:44.930 --> 53:46.848
-I'm uploading it myself.
-You can't do that.

53:46.932 --> 53:48.516
I'll just dump it on Gwyneth Paltrow's blog.

53:48.601 --> 53:50.184
We don't know everything that's in it yet.

53:50.269 --> 53:52.437
We have to work with the government.

53:52.521 --> 53:54.314
I don't like that you're working
with the government.

53:56.066 --> 53:57.567
We don't want to get people killed.

53:57.651 --> 53:58.943
What about...

54:09.496 --> 54:10.663
What about them?

54:13.500 --> 54:15.710
A lot of people are sacrificing for you.

54:16.337 --> 54:18.671
I expect your cooperation in return.

54:18.756 --> 54:20.882
You'll have my cooperation for 96 hours.

54:22.301 --> 54:24.260
That should give you the time
to do what you need to do.

54:25.054 --> 54:26.304
-Mac.
-Yeah?

54:26.388 --> 54:27.764
Charlie's gathering everyone in the kitchen

54:27.848 --> 54:29.724
-on the west side of the building.
-Okay.

54:37.024 --> 54:39.484
The man had made his peace
with the end of the world. Hi.

54:39.568 --> 54:41.277
Did you know the interview
was gonna be like that?

54:41.362 --> 54:42.362
Um, Mr. McAvoy.

54:42.446 --> 54:43.821
That's not what we were expecting,
was it, Maggie?

54:43.948 --> 54:46.783
-No.
-After 20 years at the EPA... Hi.

54:46.867 --> 54:49.869
400 parts per million
was about all his sense of logic could handle

54:49.954 --> 54:51.704
- and his mind packed up.
- I saw the interview, too.

54:51.789 --> 54:54.457
When we went to commercial, I asked him
if he'd changed his behavior at all.

54:54.541 --> 54:56.209
-He said he stopped buying lottery tickets.
-Mr. McAvoy.

54:56.293 --> 54:58.086
-I understand his frustration.
-Sir!

55:05.719 --> 55:07.971
Guys, I'm sorry, could you give me
just a second?

55:08.055 --> 55:09.973
I'm here all night. Just a second.

55:19.066 --> 55:20.817
That's a subpoena in your pocket, right?

55:22.277 --> 55:23.653
Sir, my name is Eli Shapiro.

55:23.737 --> 55:25.238
I work for the US Department of Justice.

55:25.322 --> 55:28.032
-They sent an intern.
-I'm Rebecca Halliday.

55:28.117 --> 55:29.575
-You're supposed to give that to me.
-Oh.

55:31.245 --> 55:32.412
Uh, Mr. Mc...

55:34.498 --> 55:36.624
-I'm sorry. Uh...
-Go ahead. Don't be nervous.

55:37.251 --> 55:39.836
Uh, Mr. McAvoy,
this is a subpoena for you to be sworn in

55:39.920 --> 55:43.381
before an investigative grand jury
at 1 St. Andrew's Plaza,

55:43.465 --> 55:45.800
Monday, April 29 at 10:00 AM.

55:57.271 --> 56:00.356
You think it's possible
I'm not as big a TV star as I thought?
