[Ding]

00:10.959 --> 00:12.583
You know what
this is about.

00:12.583 --> 00:15.000
Morning? Oh, my God!

00:15.000 --> 00:17.333
Look, I have no interest
in her at all.

00:17.333 --> 00:20.375
I saw you wanking to her
the other night.

00:20.375 --> 00:23.500
Bev, stop! You're
on the wrong side!

00:23.500 --> 00:25.625
No, Sean!
You're on the wrong side!

00:25.625 --> 00:28.000
That's not what I meant!

00:28.000 --> 00:29.792
[Tires screech]

00:31.667 --> 00:33.375
You want to let it out?
Fine, let it out.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.166
Yeah, let it out!

00:35.166 --> 00:36.667
Aah! Okay,
stop letting it out.

00:36.667 --> 00:37.875
Enough letting it out!

00:37.875 --> 00:39.500
No!

00:39.500 --> 00:41.125
[Panting]

00:43.875 --> 00:46.041
If you want me
to stop...

00:47.875 --> 00:50.041
say stop.

00:52.083 --> 00:53.875
Stop.

[Typewriter clicking]

01:52.542 --> 01:54.083
[Ding]

02:09.959 --> 02:11.625
You smell like cinnamon.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.333
Oh. Heh heh.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.792
It's Joey.
What?

02:15.792 --> 02:18.291
When  Friends
was really hot,

02:18.291 --> 02:21.375
they got me to do
this cologne called Joey.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.959
No.
Yeah.

02:22.959 --> 02:25.041
I even got to pick out
the scent myself.

02:25.041 --> 02:28.750
Turns out I don't have
the most sophisticated nose.

02:28.750 --> 02:32.041
Plus, the day we did it,
I was really hungry.

02:32.041 --> 02:34.792
Which is why you now smell
like a cinnamon bun.

02:34.792 --> 02:36.583
Hey, it is called Joey.

02:36.583 --> 02:37.792
[Laughs]

02:37.792 --> 02:39.750
You know, just
'cause you picked it

02:39.750 --> 02:41.667
doesn't mean
you have to wear it.

02:41.667 --> 02:44.083
I know. I still
kind of like it.

02:45.041 --> 02:46.458
It didn't sell for shit.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.333
Shocking.

02:48.333 --> 02:51.166
I got boxes of it
in the garage if you
ever want some.

02:51.166 --> 02:52.667
My mother uses it
during the holidays

02:52.667 --> 02:53.834
as a bathroom spray.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.083
I thought
you didn't want one.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.959
Yeah, I gave up.

03:04.333 --> 03:05.834
[Sighs]

03:12.667 --> 03:14.458
I have to say,
I have a vague sense

03:14.458 --> 03:16.500
I'm a terrible,
terrible person.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.750
In general,
or because of this?

03:18.750 --> 03:20.709
Because of this.
Okay.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.625
Look...

03:30.625 --> 03:33.583
don't beat yourself up.

03:33.583 --> 03:35.375
Okay?

03:36.583 --> 03:38.208
Stuff happens.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.291
Heh. Stuff happens?

03:40.291 --> 03:43.750
Yeah, stuff happens.
We did it.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.125
We can't undo it.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.667
What, are you gonna
unfuck me?

03:46.667 --> 03:48.041
[Laughs]

03:49.458 --> 03:50.875
So, there you go.

03:52.709 --> 03:55.208
Besides...

03:55.208 --> 03:57.542
why am I feeling bad?

03:57.542 --> 03:59.959
He did it first.
What?

03:59.959 --> 04:01.625
Sean--with Morning.

04:01.625 --> 04:03.250
Oh.

04:04.959 --> 04:06.458
What?

04:06.458 --> 04:07.834
No, no.

04:07.834 --> 04:10.083
Keep not feeling bad.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.875
What are you saying?

04:14.166 --> 04:15.875
Okay.

04:15.875 --> 04:17.709
Seanie never did
a thing with Morning.

04:17.709 --> 04:19.083
Right.

04:19.083 --> 04:20.792
Believe me,
I would know.

04:20.792 --> 04:23.875
I did everything
but unzip him
and take it out.

04:23.875 --> 04:24.917
He wasn't interested.

04:24.917 --> 04:26.583
[Laughs]

04:26.583 --> 04:29.208
I really, really need
for that not to be true.

04:29.208 --> 04:30.875
Hey, I'd be the first
person he'd call

04:30.875 --> 04:32.375
if he made a move
with her.

04:32.375 --> 04:35.458
I'm telling you--
he did nothing.

04:37.083 --> 04:39.291
Oh, Jesus.
You really mean that.

04:39.291 --> 04:42.291
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

04:42.291 --> 04:44.083
Why didn't you tell me?

04:44.083 --> 04:46.458
I tried. You didn't
believe me.

04:46.458 --> 04:49.667
Then you try again!
You try until
you convince me,

04:49.667 --> 04:51.917
anything to stop me
from doing the stupidest
thing in my life!

04:51.917 --> 04:53.834
Let me ask you
something.

04:53.834 --> 04:55.750
If I had convinced you
he didn't do it,

04:55.750 --> 04:58.083
do you think there's
a chance we would've
ended up here?

04:58.083 --> 04:59.458
Are you crazy?
Of course not!

04:59.458 --> 05:03.208
Right. See,
the self-cockblock--

05:03.208 --> 05:05.041
not my kind of move.

05:05.041 --> 05:06.625
Oh, God.

05:06.625 --> 05:08.792
Oh, God.

05:08.792 --> 05:10.709
What have I done?

05:10.709 --> 05:14.417
[Squealing] Oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God.

Front door ajar.

05:42.291 --> 05:43.500
Front door ajar.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.375
Do you know your
front door's ajar?

05:52.542 --> 05:55.000
I assumed you were
somewhere over
Newfoundland right now.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.291
I listened to
your messages.

05:57.291 --> 05:58.750
All 47 of them.

05:58.750 --> 06:00.375
Right.

06:00.375 --> 06:01.959
I was thinking
of making them

06:01.959 --> 06:03.333
into a one-man show.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.125
I'd buy a ticket.

06:07.417 --> 06:10.000
I, um--

06:10.000 --> 06:12.792
I think I may have
overreacted.

06:12.792 --> 06:15.000
Maybe a tad.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.792
I should have trusted you.

06:17.792 --> 06:19.875
It would've been nice.

06:19.875 --> 06:22.208
I'm sorry.

06:22.208 --> 06:24.583
I'm just happy
you're back.

06:29.041 --> 06:31.959
I'm so, so sorry.
Oh, please.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.208
The worst that's happened
is you missed a bizarro
lunch with Merc.

06:34.208 --> 06:37.709
Oh, um, I smashed up
the hire car.

06:37.709 --> 06:39.166
What? Are you
all right?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.458
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

06:40.458 --> 06:42.166
Except the car.
That's definitely not fine.

06:42.166 --> 06:43.375
But that's the worst
that's happened.

06:53.458 --> 06:54.834
You smell like cinnamon.

06:54.834 --> 06:56.834
I had a bun.

06:59.875 --> 07:03.625
All right, I'm only
gonna ask you out once,

07:03.625 --> 07:05.333
and I don't want you
to say yes

07:05.333 --> 07:06.792
because the team is here.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.667
And I don't want you
to say yes because--

07:08.667 --> 07:10.542
No.
Say...what, now?

07:10.542 --> 07:11.625
No.

07:14.417 --> 07:16.667
Okay, I didn't
actually ask you yet.

07:16.667 --> 07:20.250
So, technically,
this doesn't count
as my once.

07:20.250 --> 07:22.500
Well, when you do,
it's still going to be no.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.125
This is punishing.

07:24.125 --> 07:27.083
That's fine. We'll see.

07:27.083 --> 07:29.375
Walk away.
Just walk away.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.083
I'll see you around,
Miss McCutcheon.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.959
Have a good day,
Mr. Lyman.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.542
Children should not
have to see that.

07:37.542 --> 07:38.583
Shut up.

07:40.375 --> 07:42.792
And cut!

07:42.792 --> 07:46.166
And the  Pucks!
pilot
is officially done.

07:55.959 --> 07:58.250
SEAN:
Excuse me. Um, uh--

07:58.250 --> 08:01.000
Bev and I would
like to say,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.083
what a wonderful
couple of weeks
it's been.

08:06.166 --> 08:09.166
Oh. Oh, um,
yes, absolutely.

08:09.166 --> 08:12.458
It really has been
a little bit of heaven.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.375
You've all done
brilliant work,

08:14.375 --> 08:16.792
and may I also say
thank you

08:16.792 --> 08:18.250
for making
two foreigners

08:18.250 --> 08:20.125
feel very welcome.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.667
So, yes,
now we're off to
the editing room

08:23.667 --> 08:25.625
to polish this gem.

08:25.625 --> 08:27.458
And then, hopefully,
the powers that be

08:27.458 --> 08:29.166
will have the wisdom
to let us all come back

08:29.166 --> 08:31.041
and play together for
many years to come.

08:31.041 --> 08:33.667
Hear, hear!
[Cheering]

08:40.709 --> 08:43.542
[Overlapping chatter]

08:49.709 --> 08:53.208
Walk away.
Just walk away.

08:53.208 --> 08:54.500
I'll see you around,
Miss McCutcheon.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.166
Have a good day,
Mr. Lyman.

08:56.166 --> 08:57.834
BOY: Children should
not have to see that.

08:57.834 --> 08:59.542
Shut up.

09:08.291 --> 09:10.542
Is it any better?

09:10.542 --> 09:12.583
I don't know.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.375
It's shorter.

09:14.375 --> 09:18.041
So...there's
less of it.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.375
Yeah.

09:19.375 --> 09:21.250
Do we hand it in?

09:22.625 --> 09:24.959
I suppose.

09:24.959 --> 09:26.542
Maybe we're just
too close to it.

09:26.542 --> 09:28.166
Maybe it's
not so bad.

09:28.166 --> 09:29.583
Peter,
what do you think?

09:29.583 --> 09:31.458
I agree.
Yeah?

09:31.458 --> 09:33.083
It's shorter.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.125
Why do all of
our pilots suck?

09:39.125 --> 09:42.208
I sit there, I watch them,
and it is just--

09:42.208 --> 09:44.792
it's just--
it's incomprehensible.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.959
This is the Hindenburg
of development slates.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.875
These pilots--they make me
wish that I had cancer again,

09:50.875 --> 09:53.250
just so I could tell people,
"You think this is bad?

09:53.250 --> 09:55.542
"I have cancer again!"

09:55.542 --> 09:57.458
How the fuck
did this happen?

09:57.458 --> 09:59.417
Yo, sunshine.

09:59.417 --> 10:01.041
That is not
a rhetorical question.

10:01.041 --> 10:03.875
How the fuck
did this happen?

10:03.875 --> 10:05.667
I don't know.

10:05.667 --> 10:06.792
You're the head
of comedy!

10:06.792 --> 10:08.458
Why isn't any of
your shit funny?

10:08.458 --> 10:10.250
Some of my shit's funny.

10:10.250 --> 10:12.041
No?
No!

10:12.041 --> 10:13.583
Well...

10:13.583 --> 10:15.792
comedy is
very subjective.

10:15.792 --> 10:18.667
Oh, is it? Is it?

10:18.667 --> 10:20.625
So, is it me?

10:20.625 --> 10:22.417
Am I being too negative?

10:22.417 --> 10:24.208
Well, please, someone--

10:24.208 --> 10:25.834
tell me the ones you like.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.875
Can anyone come up
with one goddamn show

10:27.875 --> 10:30.208
that we can put on
in the fall?

10:30.208 --> 10:31.709
Oh, come on.

10:31.709 --> 10:33.542
Somebody have the balls
to say something.

10:33.542 --> 10:36.542
I only have one.
I'm doing all the talking.

10:36.542 --> 10:38.333
Yes. Good. Go.

10:38.333 --> 10:42.333
I kind of liked
the talking dog show.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.625
You're fired.

10:44.625 --> 10:46.000
[Laughs]

10:46.000 --> 10:47.667
Uh...

10:47.667 --> 10:50.291
Are, um--

10:50.291 --> 10:51.792
Are you being funny?

10:51.792 --> 10:53.834
[Laughs]

10:53.834 --> 10:56.041
You see, that's--
that's our problem.

10:56.041 --> 10:58.834
No one here knows
what's funny.

10:58.834 --> 11:00.375
Go. Get out
of here now.

11:00.375 --> 11:02.417
Heh. Really?
Go!

11:37.500 --> 11:38.959
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Good-bye.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.834
Uh, Roger--
pen, please.

11:51.125 --> 11:52.166
Oh.

11:58.208 --> 11:59.375
Anyone else?

11:59.375 --> 12:01.583
Give me one pilot we've got

12:01.583 --> 12:03.166
that isn't totally repellant.

12:03.166 --> 12:05.834
The dog was funny!

12:08.875 --> 12:10.667
All right.

12:10.667 --> 12:11.709
I never thought
the dog was funny.

12:11.709 --> 12:13.709
All right, people.

12:13.709 --> 12:16.041
You spent a year of your
lives on these things.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.542
For Christ's sake,
defend your work.

12:18.542 --> 12:20.959
We all thought the
Debra Winger thing
was pretty funny.

12:20.959 --> 12:24.542
She was funnier dying
in Shirley MacLaine's arms.

12:24.542 --> 12:25.667
Yeah, but that
was a movie.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.583
[Laughs] Ohh.

12:28.583 --> 12:30.375
If I could fire you...

12:32.083 --> 12:34.083
I still like  Pucks!

12:34.083 --> 12:36.250
No, it's not
groundbreaking,

12:36.250 --> 12:37.875
but it's fun.

12:37.875 --> 12:39.166
And the kids
are cute.

12:39.166 --> 12:40.750
And Matt
is really good.

12:40.750 --> 12:43.291
I--I still like it.

12:43.291 --> 12:45.542
I'm not gonna fire you,

12:45.542 --> 12:47.250
but I do think less of you.

12:47.250 --> 12:48.625
[Sighs] Look...

12:48.625 --> 12:51.083
we haven't even tested
any of these things.

12:51.083 --> 12:54.542
You don't know what
people will respond to.

12:54.542 --> 12:57.375
I'll be happy if they don't
tear the fucking dials
off the seats

12:57.375 --> 12:58.959
and throw them at the screen.

13:02.166 --> 13:04.291
What am I supposed
to tell New York?

13:09.792 --> 13:11.417
It's good they
haven't called, right?

13:11.417 --> 13:13.083
If they'd called
and said it was dead,

13:13.083 --> 13:14.959
then, uh, the show
would be dead.

13:14.959 --> 13:17.959
But no call means it's
still alive, right?

13:17.959 --> 13:19.250
Wow.
What?

13:19.250 --> 13:21.166
Only you could see
the positive in nothing.

13:21.166 --> 13:24.834
I'm just saying,
there's still hope.

13:24.834 --> 13:26.834
Darling, don't take this
the wrong way.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.125
I don't care.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.500
Well, you care.
No.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.083
I don't.
We're going home. Home!

13:33.083 --> 13:36.625
To proper tea
and gentle irony.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.125
To a place where
no one says...

13:38.125 --> 13:40.125
[American accent]
"Oh, my God!
I love your accent!"

13:40.125 --> 13:42.458
I truly can't wait.

13:42.458 --> 13:45.458
I hope it's raining.

13:45.458 --> 13:48.458
[Telephone rings]

13:48.458 --> 13:50.083
Hello?
Hey there.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.000
It's Carol.
Hi, Carol!

13:52.000 --> 13:55.166
I'm just calling to wish
you guys a good flight.

13:55.166 --> 13:57.208
Thank you.
And...the show?

13:57.208 --> 13:59.667
The little show?
The television show?
Any word on that?

13:59.667 --> 14:02.500
I liked it.
Oh, bollocks.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.291
No, I really did.
But...

14:05.291 --> 14:07.208
it didn't screen
so great

14:07.208 --> 14:08.792
over here at the network.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.875
Some people liked it
more than others.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.375
What about Merc?

14:12.375 --> 14:14.333
He was one of the others.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.834
[Imitates gunshot]

14:16.834 --> 14:18.500
It's not
totally dead yet.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.250
Heh. Yet.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.166
Right now we're showing it
to test audiences.

14:22.166 --> 14:25.667
Who knows?
Maybe real people
will respond to it.

14:25.667 --> 14:28.166
There are real people
in L.A.?

14:28.166 --> 14:31.875
[Laughs] No.
No, no, no.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.208
We bus them in.

14:33.208 --> 14:35.542
Well, thanks
a lot for the call.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.208
We've still got
a load of packing to do.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.166
[British accent]
Is that Charles
and Camilla?

14:39.166 --> 14:40.917
They're heading back
to London tonight.

14:40.917 --> 14:43.917
Oh, no!
But I made porridge!

14:43.917 --> 14:45.250
Ha ha.
Ha ha.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.500
I'm gonna miss that.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.208
Ha ha ha!
Listen, you guys.

14:49.208 --> 14:51.417
The pilot's terrific.
Great work.

14:51.417 --> 14:53.834
Everyone here
loved it.

14:53.834 --> 14:56.542
So, does that mean
you're picking it up?

14:56.542 --> 14:57.834
We're gonna be on TV?

14:57.834 --> 14:59.834
Oh, well, we're
still deciding,

14:59.834 --> 15:02.041
but you are totally
in the mix.

15:02.041 --> 15:05.750
We just have to see how
everything shakes out.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.333
I wish it were
just up to me.

15:08.542 --> 15:11.333
But, hey,
no matter what--

15:11.333 --> 15:12.875
we're gonna get you
back here.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.709
You guys are too good.

15:14.709 --> 15:16.625
We gotta do
something together.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.542
Why don't we
do this together?

15:18.542 --> 15:20.250
[Chuckles] Fly safe.

15:20.250 --> 15:21.083
[Beep]

15:24.333 --> 15:26.667
Ohh.

15:26.667 --> 15:29.625
I'm sorry.
Oh, it's fine.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.333
Hey, we had fun.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.125
No, you didn't.
No, I didn't.

15:33.125 --> 15:35.458
We should let Matt
know it's dead.

15:35.458 --> 15:38.000
I was gonna run over
there and say good-bye.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.709
I assume you don't want
to be part of that.

15:39.709 --> 15:41.750
That would be no.
Yeah.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.750
[Groans]

15:51.083 --> 15:52.709
I feel like
we let you down.

15:52.709 --> 15:55.083
Nah.
I do.

15:56.417 --> 15:57.917
We should've done
better by you.

15:57.917 --> 16:01.333
Hey. Don't do that.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.792
It's like your wife said--

16:02.792 --> 16:04.458
everything that made
this show worse

16:04.458 --> 16:06.667
was totally my fault.

16:06.667 --> 16:09.709
She told you that?
When?

16:09.709 --> 16:12.125
Uh...

16:12.125 --> 16:14.417
I don't know.
On the stage, I guess.

16:14.417 --> 16:16.291
I didn't realize you two
were even speaking.

16:16.291 --> 16:18.875
Oh, yeah. Now and then.

16:18.875 --> 16:20.375
Just, like, you know,
mean things.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.083
Oh.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.792
Hey, don't you have
a plane to catch?

16:25.792 --> 16:27.041
Oh, yeah, I should
get going.

16:27.041 --> 16:28.625
If we miss this flight,

16:28.625 --> 16:30.625
Bev will literally
kill me,

16:30.625 --> 16:32.583
and I literally mean
"literally".

16:34.125 --> 16:37.125
Well, okay, man.

16:37.125 --> 16:40.125
I really hope we can
keep in touch.
Totally.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.792
I know people always
say that at the end
of these things,

16:41.792 --> 16:43.500
but I mean it.
This was--

16:43.500 --> 16:45.500
This was...

16:45.500 --> 16:47.583
the best part
of all this.

16:47.583 --> 16:49.375
I agree.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.291
I don't have
that many guy friends,
and this was--

16:51.291 --> 16:53.583
Oh, Christ,
I'm making a speech.

16:53.583 --> 16:56.000
Dude, you are.
Yeah, so...

16:56.000 --> 16:58.417
blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.917
Wow. That was
some moving shit.

17:00.917 --> 17:02.834
It was, wasn't it?

17:02.834 --> 17:04.500
Well, me, too.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.625
Come here.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.291
What?

17:12.291 --> 17:14.834
Hug me again.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.208
Okay. This may be why
you don't have many
guy friends.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.750
[Chuckles]
That was weird.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.250
What's that smell--
your cologne,
or whatever it is?

17:24.250 --> 17:26.208
Oh. It's called Joey,

17:26.208 --> 17:28.083
from back when
I was doing  Friends.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.750
It's very...
cinnamony.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.875
I know. My four-year-old
says I smell like a candle.

17:32.875 --> 17:35.250
It's--It's bizarre.
The other day,

17:35.250 --> 17:38.166
Bev had
the same smell.

17:38.166 --> 17:39.500
Huh.

17:40.417 --> 17:42.166
Well, uh...

17:42.166 --> 17:43.875
maybe she went
to a candle shop.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.709
Girls do like
the candles.

17:45.709 --> 17:48.041
Hey, you want some?
I got cases of it.

17:48.041 --> 17:49.583
That's all right.
No, no, no.

17:49.583 --> 17:51.834
Come on.
A going-away present.

17:58.583 --> 18:01.125
You know, I never got
the whole concept

18:01.125 --> 18:03.041
of celebrity scents.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.917
I mean, why would anyone
want to smell like me...

18:04.917 --> 18:07.625
or Britney Spears,
or Elizabeth Taylor?

18:07.625 --> 18:10.750
Have you seen her lately?
That's what you want
to smell like?

18:10.750 --> 18:12.750
Where's the Jag?
It's in the shop.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.000
I had a little accident.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.542
Oh, shit.
What happened?

18:15.542 --> 18:17.583
I, uh--

18:17.583 --> 18:18.792
I hit a deer.

18:18.792 --> 18:20.250
Oh, my God.

18:20.250 --> 18:22.542
That's bloody dangerous.
Tell me about it.

18:22.542 --> 18:24.000
I was just driving along,
talking on the phone,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
and all of a sudden,
I look up,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.625
and there's this
fuckin' deer coming at me
in the wrong lane.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.500
What's the right lane
for a deer?

18:30.500 --> 18:33.500
I meant, like...there's
a deer in my lane.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.250
So, I hit the brakes
and turn,

18:35.250 --> 18:38.041
and the thing smashes
into my side.

18:38.041 --> 18:39.250
Christ.
Yeah.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.583
Were you all right?

18:40.583 --> 18:42.625
I--I was fine.

18:42.625 --> 18:45.709
Yeah, the side of the car
was totally dented in.

18:45.709 --> 18:46.875
And the deer?

18:48.750 --> 18:50.125
It, uh, just...

18:50.125 --> 18:51.625
got up and--

18:52.959 --> 18:54.500
what, loped?

18:54.500 --> 18:56.917
Do deers lope?
They lope, right?

18:56.917 --> 19:00.500
Well, it just loped away.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.625
Lope.

19:02.625 --> 19:03.917
You all right?

19:03.917 --> 19:07.125
Yeah. Why?
Well, you seem--

19:07.125 --> 19:09.041
Well, you know,
I'm just reliving it.

19:09.041 --> 19:11.959
Yeah, right. Sure.

19:11.959 --> 19:14.834
Bev was just
in an accident, too.

19:14.834 --> 19:16.917
Wow. You're--
You're kidding.

19:16.917 --> 19:18.834
What--What happened
in hers?

19:18.834 --> 19:20.166
I don't know. Um...

19:22.041 --> 19:24.333
she never actually
gave me the details.

19:24.333 --> 19:25.959
Huh.

19:25.959 --> 19:27.000
Maybe it was
the same deer.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.625
Maybe.

19:32.875 --> 19:34.792
Here we go.

19:34.792 --> 19:36.792
Joey.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.792
Look at this.
Heh heh!

19:46.792 --> 19:48.500
"How you smellin'?"

19:48.500 --> 19:51.000
Gee, I wonder why
we didn't sell any.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.417
That is some...

19:52.417 --> 19:55.125
bad cologne...

19:56.417 --> 19:58.000
slogan...

19:59.542 --> 20:01.291
writing.

20:04.208 --> 20:06.166
Dude, say something.
You're kind of
freaking me out.

20:06.166 --> 20:08.542
Actually, you're the one
freaking me out.

20:08.542 --> 20:09.792
Why's that?

20:11.041 --> 20:12.208
Did you--

20:13.792 --> 20:16.333
Did you shag my wife?

20:16.333 --> 20:17.917
[Laughs] What?!

20:17.917 --> 20:20.000
Did you shag my wife?

20:20.000 --> 20:23.417
Okay. First of all--
"shag"?

20:23.417 --> 20:26.125
I thought that was
just from those
Austin Powers movies.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.542
Seriously?
That's a real word?

20:28.542 --> 20:30.041
Oh, my God.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.625
I just never know
with you guys,

20:31.625 --> 20:33.291
with your crumpets
and your blimeys.

20:33.291 --> 20:35.750
What--What--
What is a blimey?

20:35.750 --> 20:37.417
Oh, for Christ's sake,
grow some balls,

20:37.417 --> 20:39.250
to go with that
ridiculous cock,

20:39.250 --> 20:40.792
and answer me.

20:40.792 --> 20:43.333
Did you shag...

20:43.333 --> 20:46.083
my wife?

20:48.625 --> 20:50.709
Okay.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.250
All right.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.083
She totally started it.

20:54.083 --> 20:56.375
She was driving on the
wrong side of the street--

20:56.375 --> 20:57.792
So you fucked her?!

20:57.792 --> 21:00.041
No, no, no!

21:00.041 --> 21:01.291
She smashed into me,

21:01.291 --> 21:04.250
and she had a cut
on her head.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.208
So, I brought her back here
to take care of it.

21:06.208 --> 21:07.917
Oh, yeah, you took
care of it, all right.

21:07.917 --> 21:11.250
You son of a bitch.

21:11.250 --> 21:13.250
How did this happen?
She despises you.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.917
You must've had to try
so bloody hard.

21:15.917 --> 21:18.250
What a conquest.
What a triumph.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.917
It wasn't like that.
It wasn't hard.

21:20.917 --> 21:23.959
It wasn't easy.
Jesus!

21:23.959 --> 21:26.917
I don't know what to say.
I want to leave.
But it's my house.

21:26.917 --> 21:28.083
How could you do this?

21:28.083 --> 21:30.458
Uh...stuff happens?

21:30.458 --> 21:31.917
Stuff happens?!

21:31.917 --> 21:33.542
Apparently!

21:33.542 --> 21:35.208
Look, it wasn't like
something we planned.

21:35.208 --> 21:38.959
Believe me, your wife
is the last woman
in the world

21:38.959 --> 21:41.125
I would ever want
to fuck.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.542
Because she's your wife.

21:43.542 --> 21:46.291
I'm not saying
she's unfuckable.

21:46.291 --> 21:50.041
Oh, God. I am trying
to apologize here.

21:50.041 --> 21:51.917
I don't want
your bloody apology!

21:51.917 --> 21:54.959
Too bad.
I'm sorry, okay?

21:54.959 --> 21:58.625
I am so, so sorry.

21:58.625 --> 22:00.917
I did a terrible thing--
I get that.

22:00.917 --> 22:02.583
I never meant to hurt you.

22:04.083 --> 22:06.792
You fucking bastard.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.208
Hey, what are you doing?
Calm down.

22:09.208 --> 22:11.458
Don't get crazy.

22:11.458 --> 22:12.959
Or what? You'll
screw her again?

22:12.959 --> 22:14.667
Hey, it wasn't
just me, you know.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.041
How many were there?!

22:16.041 --> 22:17.709
No, I mean she
was there, too.

22:17.709 --> 22:19.875
And this only happened
because she was so pissed

22:19.875 --> 22:21.375

tell her?!

22:24.834 --> 22:26.166
I tried!
How hard?!

22:26.166 --> 22:28.000
Let's not focus
on that!

22:28.000 --> 22:31.792
Look,
I said I'm sorry.

22:31.792 --> 22:34.667
I don't know
what else to say.

22:34.667 --> 22:35.875
You're right.

22:35.875 --> 22:38.333
That's enough talking.

22:38.333 --> 22:40.125
What are you doing?
Hey, put that down.

22:41.834 --> 22:44.083

24:06.625 --> 24:09.208
It's nearly time to
leave for the airport,

24:09.208 --> 24:11.000
and you're not back yet.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.083
I hope you're not
still there.

Of course
it bloody stings.

24:53.291 --> 24:55.291
Well, we should
go to the hospital.

24:55.291 --> 24:56.959

take me to hospital.

"the hospital",

you've got--

25:40.458 --> 25:42.583
He should be
a fuckin' detective.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.208
He just started
finding out all these
little clues--

25:44.208 --> 25:45.375
that my car was gone,

25:45.375 --> 25:47.250

You're wearing enough.

25:47.250 --> 25:49.125

to your eyes?

Your lover
tried to blind me!

26:06.458 --> 26:07.792
He had a cactus!

26:07.792 --> 26:10.041
He's not my lover.
I swear,

26:10.041 --> 26:12.375
the thought
that I was with him
physically disgusts me.

26:12.375 --> 26:13.917
I'm--I'm actually
nauseated.

26:13.917 --> 26:15.917

to vomit.

So fucking what?!

I told you he was
throwing shit.

26:22.792 --> 26:24.250
I don't care
that you're sorry.

26:24.250 --> 26:27.041
It doesn't undo
what you did.

26:27.041 --> 26:29.875
Which was only because
of the thing between
you and Morning!

26:29.875 --> 26:31.583
There was no thing
between me and Morning!

26:31.583 --> 26:33.333

the two of you.

think there is
a "two of us".

listen to me.

26:40.542 --> 26:41.792

that way now--

26:41.792 --> 26:45.125
You have no idea
how I feel.

26:46.417 --> 26:49.625
Because if you did,
that would imply

26:49.625 --> 26:52.875
you had a grain of
empathy in your body.

And if that were
the case...

for the last eight years.

too melodramatic,
