01:58.147 --> 01:59.632
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, dad.

02:01.055 --> 02:02.893
What’s going on with the unibomber look?

02:03.267 --> 02:04.966
I was going for George Clooney.

02:05.045 --> 02:05.833
Go further.

02:07.744 --> 02:10.553
That’s right, you’re not used to seeing me like this.

02:10.660 --> 02:14.676
See, when I’m on the job I usually let it grow then I shave it off right before I come home.

02:14.721 --> 02:15.929
Kind of a ritual for me.

02:16.001 --> 02:18.202
Well, make sure you find a razor day after tomorrow.

02:18.489 --> 02:21.227
And after that, I’m gonna be shaving a lot more often.

02:21.331 --> 02:21.919
Okay.

02:21.986 --> 02:23.855
Hey Brooke. Hey rake boy.

02:24.531 --> 02:27.014
I see nobody uses the doorbell still.

02:27.132 --> 02:29.890
Papa Peyton, the scruffy thing’s working for you.

02:30.076 --> 02:31.448
What are you guys up to so early?

02:31.530 --> 02:35.405
- I don’t know. Peyton just asked us…
- Oh no, you know what? You’ll find out when you get home.

02:35.590 --> 02:36.619
Not even a little hint?

02:36.686 --> 02:38.837
Uh Uh. Not even. I love you

02:39.308 --> 02:41.565
You better. Love you too, honey.

02:41.635 --> 02:42.307
Bye.

02:44.140 --> 02:45.646
So, what’s the surprise?

02:47.162 --> 02:49.333
I need your help with something. Come on.

02:54.504 --> 02:57.622
Damn, that’s nice. Is this your dads?

02:57.873 --> 03:00.600
Yeah, he hasn’t driven it in like a year though.

03:00.946 --> 03:02.265
Do you think you can get it to run?

03:02.501 --> 03:03.448
Of course he can.

03:03.638 --> 03:06.761
And he’s going to look good doing it too in a tight little wife beater,

03:06.802 --> 03:08.252
maybe some grease smudges.

03:08.631 --> 03:11.789
And I was thinking maybe you could help me wash and wax.

03:11.877 --> 03:12.623
Glad to help.

03:13.591 --> 03:16.724
I just want to do something nice for him. Since he’s coming home.

03:18.625 --> 03:19.350
Alright,

03:20.743 --> 03:21.798
I’ll go get my tools.

03:26.233 --> 03:27.241
Surprise!

03:27.754 --> 03:29.182
You answer the door in your underwear?

03:29.253 --> 03:31.620
Grandma, Grandpa. What are you guys doing here?

03:32.484 --> 03:35.956
Royal, May, oh, what a surprise.

03:36.124 --> 03:39.566
Well, thanks for the warm welcome. I told you this ambush was a bad idea.

03:39.790 --> 03:43.457
- He’s dragging me to another one of those auto conventions.
- Nobody’s dragging anybody anywhere.

03:43.524 --> 03:47.931
I told him that the only way I’d go is if we came by here for Danny’s birthday.

03:48.366 --> 03:50.834
Oh, Dan’s birthday, of course.

03:51.372 --> 03:52.052
Yeah.

03:53.569 --> 03:56.517
Well, you going to leave us standing out here all morning freezing our asses off?

03:56.610 --> 03:57.387
- Oh…
- Come on in.

03:58.786 --> 03:59.564
Kiss Granny.

04:00.318 --> 04:02.779
Looks like you put on a few there, Deb. It looks good on you.

04:06.388 --> 04:07.006
Dan.

04:08.145 --> 04:10.024
You remembered. I’m touched.

04:10.163 --> 04:14.689
Oh I’m not here to wish you a happy birthday. But your parents are.

04:15.493 --> 04:16.088
What?

04:16.240 --> 04:17.562
Yeah, they showed up at the house.

04:17.755 --> 04:20.223
Apparently, you never told them that you’re not living there right now.

04:21.981 --> 04:23.190
How’d they take it?

04:24.074 --> 04:29.174
You think I told them? I’m not going to be on the receiving end of that. That’s your job.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.372
Well, how long are they here?

04:30.940 --> 04:35.953
Just tonight. But it gets better. Your mother is cooking you a big birthday dinner.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.468
Oh perfect.

04:38.267 --> 04:39.568
Alright, so what are we going to do?

04:39.808 --> 04:44.432
We are not going to do anything. You are going to go to the house right now,

04:44.477 --> 04:47.739
- and tell them we’re separated.
- No, we’re doing the counseling.

04:48.013 --> 04:50.181
We can work this thing out, right? Isn’t that the whole point?

04:50.647 --> 04:52.752
- It is.
- Well, you know how they are.

04:52.885 --> 04:55.056
Do you really want them weighing in on the state of our marriage?

04:56.824 --> 04:58.906
Do you remember when we told them we weren’t going to have any more kids?

04:58.975 --> 05:02.433
How many times did my dad call you? And now you don’t even have the option of hanging up on him.

05:03.626 --> 05:05.198
Go on, Dan. Just say it.

05:05.445 --> 05:07.882
We go through the motions tonight. Get it over with.

05:07.937 --> 05:10.113
Send them on their way. Go back to working on us.

05:11.603 --> 05:16.412
Besides, it might do us some good to try and remember what its like to be a normal family.

05:19.273 --> 05:21.853
Fine, just for tonight.

05:22.463 --> 05:23.400
Just for tonight.

05:34.029 --> 05:36.329
Good morning, Sir. Table or counter?

05:36.451 --> 05:38.914
Um, actually, I’m looking for Karen.

05:39.002 --> 05:41.536
Oh you know what? She’s in Italy right now. Cooking school.

05:43.189 --> 05:44.024
Good for her.

05:45.099 --> 05:46.590
How’s that boy of hers doing?

05:47.218 --> 05:48.319
Lucas is great.

05:49.523 --> 05:51.919
She calls in every once and a while. You want me to leave a message?

05:53.298 --> 05:56.491
No, that’s alright. I’ll just catch her the next time I’m passing through.

05:56.557 --> 05:59.742
Okay, can I tell her who stopped by? Mr…

06:00.818 --> 06:02.006
Just an old friend.

06:16.434 --> 06:20.167
Well, it’s not the battery. It’s probably the starter.

06:20.663 --> 06:22.128
Well, you can fix that, right?

06:22.945 --> 06:24.892
Yeah, it shouldn’t be a problem.

06:27.894 --> 06:29.142
It’s an amazing car.

06:30.300 --> 06:31.656
It’s an amazing guy.

06:34.748 --> 06:36.503
Is that what you got me in this thing for?

06:36.892 --> 06:38.127
Yeah…

06:42.853 --> 06:44.747
I was, just getting started.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.749
Sadly, so was I.

06:48.624 --> 06:49.438
What’s wrong?

06:50.482 --> 06:51.629
I’m just worried about my dad.

06:53.809 --> 06:57.434
Okay, I just checked online and now they’re saying it’s a category 3 hurricane.

06:58.035 --> 07:00.025
Alright, and you already checked on the web cam, right?

07:00.138 --> 07:00.902
Yeah, its out.

07:01.138 --> 07:02.238
Well, maybe he turned it off.

07:02.592 --> 07:04.030
Or the storm did it for him.

07:04.198 --> 07:06.472
Yeah, but storms knock that kind of thing out all the time, right?

07:07.081 --> 07:08.832
Anyway, aren’t dredging boats huge?

07:08.950 --> 07:10.123
He wouldn’t be on the dredging boat.

07:10.825 --> 07:13.819
Right now, if there’s a storm headed his way, he’d be on this little tiny transport

07:13.870 --> 07:15.703
heading back to shore and that’s what worries me.

07:16.675 --> 07:19.697
Okay, Peyton, just stop. Don’t do this to yourself, alright?

07:19.795 --> 07:22.355
Just because he hasn’t checked in doesn’t mean something’s happened.

07:23.286 --> 07:24.710
Doesn’t mean it hasn’t either.

07:31.130 --> 07:35.580
So this dinner thing’s gonna be pretty bad, huh?

07:35.714 --> 07:36.603
Massacre.

07:37.407 --> 07:40.839
My Grandma’s okay. It’s just my Grandpa’s pretty intense.

07:42.020 --> 07:45.359
You’ve met my dad. Just imagine where he comes from.

07:45.641 --> 07:47.117
- Scary.
- Yeah.

07:48.673 --> 07:51.616
You should come tonight. Maybe it will make everybody behave.

07:52.859 --> 07:55.062
I’ll come if you want me to.

07:55.476 --> 07:58.523
No, I wasn’t serious. I wouldn’t put you through that.

07:58.580 --> 08:01.804
No I mean, if you’re asking, of course my answer’s yes.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.990
Well, then I’m asking.

08:05.429 --> 08:06.567
Well then I’m coming.

08:09.265 --> 08:12.497
Let me get this right, the charcoal finish, custom leather package,

08:12.628 --> 08:14.713
and what you want is a champaign interior.

08:15.214 --> 08:16.382
I’m here to see the manager.

08:17.027 --> 08:17.784
Excuse me

08:17.892 --> 08:20.354
Hey fellow, you ought to know who you’re doing business with.

08:20.682 --> 08:21.676
Is there a problem?

08:21.773 --> 08:24.968
Well, you’re buying from Dan Scott. Basketball legend.

08:25.106 --> 08:27.912
Still holds the all time scoring record for Tree Hill.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.648
Made all-state his Senior year.

08:29.725 --> 08:31.312
- No kidding.
- No kidding.

08:31.572 --> 08:34.988
- My dad.
- I figured. You play college too?

08:35.110 --> 08:38.388
Would have, but he blew his knee out in his freshman year. He got robbed.

08:38.458 --> 08:39.658
Would have been one of the greats.

08:39.759 --> 08:41.357
Dad, Mr. Miller’s really not interested.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.753
I’ll tell you what, meet me in my office. Okay? I’ll be right in.

08:43.818 --> 08:46.821
- Yeah.
- Champaign interior, right? Alright.

08:47.615 --> 08:49.590
What? Somebody’s got to brag on you.

08:49.693 --> 08:53.088
And you’re not going to close that sale without your old mans help you know that, don’t you?

08:53.308 --> 08:54.858
You know you always were my biggest promoter.

08:55.324 --> 08:57.440
Yeah well.

08:57.808 --> 08:59.744
Hey still in shape. Good for you.

09:05.728 --> 09:10.305
Oh you’re home. Listen, I called Nathan. I told him not to tell Dad that he’s not going to practice.

09:10.403 --> 09:11.725
You mean that he quit the team?

09:11.888 --> 09:12.893
You know what I mean.

09:13.630 --> 09:15.600
I also told Keith to avoid the subject.

09:16.020 --> 09:18.110
Any other lies I should remember to tell?

09:18.493 --> 09:20.740
I’m trying to protect our son from my father, okay?

09:21.063 --> 09:22.819
You don’t even see the irony, do you?

09:23.557 --> 09:25.543
Mom, you look beautiful as ever.

09:25.614 --> 09:27.308
God bless you for a liar.

09:27.765 --> 09:29.419
When I compliment you, you call me a liar.

09:29.496 --> 09:30.391
You look tired.

09:30.581 --> 09:33.274
Hey, son, what’s the deal? No more Charlotte hornets?

09:33.337 --> 09:36.152
Yeah, New Orleans can have them. You think they have playoffs hope?

09:36.229 --> 09:37.253
No, no.

09:37.586 --> 09:39.921
- No sports talk.
- Oh, come on.

09:40.256 --> 09:45.000
Yes ma’am. I just became head of the table then, huh?

09:45.102 --> 09:45.771
- Keith!
- Mom!

09:47.470 --> 09:48.747
You look great.

09:48.952 --> 09:51.384
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

09:51.671 --> 09:53.099
It’s good to see you too, dad.

09:54.512 --> 09:55.987
Happy birthday, Danny.

09:56.730 --> 09:57.722
Yeah, thanks.

09:58.323 --> 10:01.293
Come on, have a seat. Dinner is almost ready.

10:01.379 --> 10:02.135
Hey Deb.

10:02.787 --> 10:04.538
Danny will you pour some wine, please?

10:04.661 --> 10:06.268
- I’m on it.
- Amen to that.

10:06.366 --> 10:10.436
Uh, listen mom, we’re going to need another place setting, I invited a guest.

10:10.881 --> 10:15.181
A date! Oh my goodness, well you get that chair over there…

10:15.335 --> 10:17.261
Grandpa, Grandma, this is Haley.

10:17.368 --> 10:18.889
- Oh Haley.
- Hi.

10:19.232 --> 10:21.439
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

10:26.349 --> 10:28.853
Well, Nathan, you’re looking more and more like your old man every day.

10:28.949 --> 10:31.992
We all know where he gets his good looks, don’t we? Well, come on in.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.806
- You sit right here next to me, hun.
- Thank You.

10:35.140 --> 10:36.087
I’ll get it.

10:37.739 --> 10:39.830
Oh my goodness, Whitey!

10:40.700 --> 10:43.722
- Good to see you.
- Good evening everybody. Sorry I’m late

10:45.645 --> 10:46.902
Glad you came?

10:47.300 --> 10:48.048
Yeah.

10:53.034 --> 10:54.182
Alright, try it again.

10:57.232 --> 10:58.618
We got power!

10:58.840 --> 10:59.552
Whooo.

10:59.635 --> 11:00.875
Peyton, come check it out.

11:05.293 --> 11:06.189
What is it?

11:07.709 --> 11:08.907
I just got a phone call.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.343
Um, it’s the storm.

11:12.287 --> 11:13.941
My dad’s transport is missing.

11:15.297 --> 11:16.419
There were three guys on it.

11:17.085 --> 11:18.307
They recovered a body.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.294
What’d they tell you?

11:22.490 --> 11:24.016
I have to go see if it’s him.

11:34.002 --> 11:36.394
Alright, you sure you shouldn’t call your Grandma?

11:36.476 --> 11:40.074
No she’d freak out. I’d rather not upset her. Besides, its not going to be my dad.

11:40.238 --> 11:41.037
Of course its not.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.436
Let’s go ahead and get this over with. We have a 4 hour drive ahead of us.

11:45.097 --> 11:47.202
A 4 hour drive into a storm?

11:47.843 --> 11:51.384
Well the storms passing through. By the time we get there it should be gone.

11:51.456 --> 11:55.706
Okay, wait a second. Shouldn’t somebody stay here by the phone? I mean, incase your dad calls.

11:55.804 --> 11:57.979
I will. You go with Peyton.

11:58.399 --> 11:59.147
You sure?

11:59.315 --> 12:02.700
Yeah. Lucas you’re good in crisis, not that there’s going to be one.

12:02.750 --> 12:08.311
But I would probably end up falling apart and you’d end up taking care of me which is not the point, so…

12:09.977 --> 12:11.147
I love you.

12:11.890 --> 12:12.976
It’s going to be okay.

12:14.348 --> 12:15.176
You’re the best.

12:19.755 --> 12:21.567
I’ll call you guys if I hear anything.

12:24.143 --> 12:25.827
So, how’s the team doing this year, Whitey?

12:25.990 --> 12:27.798
Oh we’re still undefeated actually.

12:30.220 --> 12:31.847
Dad, you still rooting for the Magic these days?

12:31.921 --> 12:36.886
Please! No talk of sports until after dinner, okay?

12:36.973 --> 12:37.869
Good idea mom.

12:38.426 --> 12:39.165
Sorry.

12:40.517 --> 12:42.769
Well, Nathan, what are you averaging these days?

12:43.006 --> 12:46.246
You know your dad had 27 and a half a game. You beat that yet?

12:46.317 --> 12:49.225
- Royal, we just said…
- I’m asking the boy a question, May.

12:52.511 --> 12:55.288
Uh well maybe you should ask the old man.

12:59.665 --> 13:01.545
24 points a game I think, isn’t it?

13:01.698 --> 13:03.239
So, 24 a game huh?

13:03.485 --> 13:06.076
You’re gonna have to get that up if you’re going to beat the old man.

13:06.842 --> 13:10.684
Yeah, your dads star would have risen through the roof at Carolina

13:10.736 --> 13:13.004
if it wasn’t for that damn knee of his. How’re your knees?

13:14.155 --> 13:16.259
- No worries.
- Oh, he’s got great knees.

13:20.065 --> 13:26.280
Uh huh. Of course Danny takes after his old man. Never let adversity stop him.

13:27.017 --> 13:29.956
Too bad Keith takes after his mothers side of the family.

13:30.413 --> 13:31.589
Lucky for him.

13:31.989 --> 13:34.411
I’d drink to that, but I have to get a refill.

13:37.203 --> 13:38.757
Well, I should see about the cake.

13:38.870 --> 13:40.215
I’ll go do that, Mrs. Scott.

13:41.338 --> 13:43.882
- Want to come help?
- Yeah, the cake, right.

13:49.841 --> 13:51.420
I warned you, it was going to be intense.

13:51.532 --> 13:54.270
Oh, insane is more like it.

13:54.782 --> 13:59.047
You know, there’s a door right there. We could sneak out, nobody would even notice.

13:59.161 --> 13:59.811
Tempting.

14:01.225 --> 14:05.392
Um, so how often do your grandparents come into town?

14:06.145 --> 14:07.599
Couple times a year. Why?

14:10.226 --> 14:11.837
Haley, you’ve got that look.

14:12.848 --> 14:13.506
What look?

14:13.605 --> 14:16.471
The look you get when you want to tell me something but you don’t really want to tell me.

14:16.548 --> 14:18.697
No I don’t, and you shouldn’t know that look yet.

14:18.817 --> 14:19.589
What is it?

14:21.335 --> 14:25.815
Your grandfather came by the café today. And he asked for Karen.

14:26.251 --> 14:27.542
- He did?
- Yeah.

14:27.674 --> 14:29.926
I just kind of got the feeling like they’ve been keeping in touch.

14:31.239 --> 14:32.661
Does Lucas know?

14:32.866 --> 14:36.455
No, they’ve never even met. But your grandfather asked about him.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.775
That doesn’t make any sense.

14:39.306 --> 14:42.790
My grandpa acts like my dad’s a second coming, why would he visit Karen?

14:43.045 --> 14:45.758
I don’t know, I don’t want to start anything, I’m just telling you.

14:46.337 --> 14:48.943
You know what? My family’s so screwed up,

14:49.009 --> 14:51.897
nothing new would make a difference right now. Don’t worry about it.

14:59.320 --> 15:00.570
You warm enough?

15:01.215 --> 15:01.989
I’m okay.

15:02.548 --> 15:04.564
I should probably get the heater fixed in here, huh?

15:05.390 --> 15:09.070
You know, I could have Keith take a look at it for you. I mean he’s really good at that stuff.

15:12.899 --> 15:14.169
You want me to stop and get some coffee?

15:15.019 --> 15:17.247
I’m fine. Thanks.

15:22.340 --> 15:23.764
Thanks for doing this for me, Luke.

15:25.832 --> 15:27.030
It’s what friends are for, right?

15:28.874 --> 15:29.637
Yeah.

15:39.004 --> 15:39.939
Now what?

15:46.891 --> 15:47.916
What’s going on?

15:48.530 --> 15:50.877
Bridge is up cause of the storm. It’ll be open in the morning.

15:51.587 --> 15:54.106
Alright, we have an emergency, we have to get across the bridge.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.445
I’m sorry Miss, but it’s not safe.

15:56.850 --> 15:59.256
Okay, um, is there another way through?

15:59.492 --> 16:02.256
Only the ferries, but the channel’s too rough so they’re not running.

16:02.324 --> 16:03.399
Well, what are we supposed to do?

16:03.522 --> 16:06.803
Hopefully they’ll be able to open the bridge in the morning. 6 a.m.

16:07.505 --> 16:09.685
There’s a motel right down the road.

16:09.774 --> 16:11.805
Might want to grab yourselves a room before they’re all gone.

16:24.550 --> 16:25.339
There you go!

16:28.417 --> 16:30.064
So, Nate. How’s your game this year?

16:30.330 --> 16:31.354
Here we go again.

16:31.446 --> 16:36.187
Just cover your ears, May, I just want to know how my grandson’s doing on the team.

16:36.258 --> 16:39.423
- Well I already told you, dad.
- No you didn’t, you didn’t tell me jack.

16:39.475 --> 16:42.111
And every time I mention it you change the damn subject.

16:43.366 --> 16:45.592
Now will somebody around here tell me what’s going on?

16:47.227 --> 16:48.010
Nathan?

16:49.827 --> 16:51.450
Whitey? Anybody?

16:52.187 --> 16:54.696
Nathan, I think you better take this one.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.329
I quit the team, alright?

17:00.682 --> 17:02.822
You quit the… what do you mean you quit the team?

17:02.945 --> 17:05.469
He didn’t quit the team dad, he’s just taking some time off.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.443
No, he’s not. Please stop lying, Dan.

17:09.349 --> 17:12.970
Were you ever going to tell me this? I mean that’s a hell of a thing to keep to yourself.

17:13.077 --> 17:14.281
Yeah, you’re one to talk.

17:14.352 --> 17:15.402
What’s that supposed to mean?

17:15.479 --> 17:19.278
I know you visit Karen at the café, alright? What’s that about?

17:19.348 --> 17:21.141
- Nathan!
- That’s none of your damn business.

17:21.771 --> 17:24.469
- I guess somebody’s got a big mouth.
- You shut up, Grandpa

17:24.537 --> 17:27.567
- Don’t you talk to me like that.
- Back off, Royal.

17:27.624 --> 17:31.509
I’ve had enough of your crap. Nathan is not the problem.

17:31.915 --> 17:33.901
Would someone please explain?

17:40.109 --> 17:44.488
Dan has been riding Nathan for the past 6 years about that damn game.

17:44.541 --> 17:45.518
Deb stop.

17:45.579 --> 17:49.183
Riding him so hard, that Nathan took drugs so that he could measure up.

17:49.240 --> 17:49.830
Drugs?

17:49.876 --> 17:51.933
Until he had to be rushed to the hospital.

17:52.717 --> 17:57.944
He could have died because of this insane pressure to put a ball through a hoop.

17:59.106 --> 18:01.534
But none of that is my sons fault, Royal.

18:02.752 --> 18:03.864
It’s your sons.

18:07.602 --> 18:13.396
Danny. You of all people. How dare you!

18:13.673 --> 18:17.589
You know how much you hated it when your daddy bullied you to be better.

18:17.646 --> 18:19.009
I never bullied him.

18:20.355 --> 18:23.816
And when you wanted a way out, I gave you one.

18:23.882 --> 18:28.072
All these years. I protected you. I lied for you.

18:28.147 --> 18:30.913
And now you’re doing the same thing to your son?

18:30.960 --> 18:32.454
What lie? What are you talking about?

18:32.520 --> 18:37.707
In college. His knee injury. It wasn’t permanent.

18:39.755 --> 18:42.633
Danny quit. And I helped him.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.523
- What do you mean, he quit?
- It’s not like that, dad.

18:53.594 --> 18:56.498
Oh stop it, Dan. It’s time the truth came out.

18:56.562 --> 18:59.087
Will somebody tell me what in knee hell is going on here?

18:59.150 --> 19:01.951
You were on the road when Danny hurt his knee.

19:02.881 --> 19:04.039
So we lied.

19:04.842 --> 19:08.041
- You told me it was degenerative knee condition…
- It was Dad, it was...

19:08.136 --> 19:10.014
You looked me in the eye and told me that.

19:12.767 --> 19:18.191
Don’t you see, Royal? He was never going to be the star that you wanted him to be.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.147
You just couldn’t see that.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.989
The boy had two choices.

19:23.940 --> 19:27.146
To fail in front of you or to quit.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.794
Either way he lost.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.228
So you just quit.

19:37.858 --> 19:40.541
Without even being man enough to own up to it.

19:40.684 --> 19:41.759
There’s more to the story, dad.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.781
- You don’t know the whole story!
- I’ve had enough.

19:44.611 --> 19:46.771
Me too. Come on, Haley. I’ll take you home.

19:46.832 --> 19:47.815
Thanks for dinner.

19:48.619 --> 19:52.435
Well, I can show myself out. Thank you, May.

19:53.779 --> 19:54.584
Deb.

19:58.011 --> 19:59.991
Happy Birthday, Danny.

20:02.994 --> 20:05.183
- Danny, don’t you…
- Why?

20:11.946 --> 20:14.569
Well, I guess I’ll do the dishes.

20:25.330 --> 20:29.687
Alright, lets just try to get some sleep, then we’ll be at the bridge as soon as it opens up.

20:29.831 --> 20:30.993
What did he say? 6 a.m.?

20:31.812 --> 20:32.860
We’ll be there at 5.

20:38.315 --> 20:39.032
What?

20:40.219 --> 20:42.278
We’re in a hurry to find out if my dad’s dead.

20:43.358 --> 20:44.853
It’s just kind of surreal.

20:49.824 --> 20:51.381
Yeah, it’s pretty messed up.

20:52.733 --> 20:56.055
You know how in dreams, you’re always trying to get to some place you need to be

20:56.156 --> 20:57.653
but you never really get there?

20:58.001 --> 20:58.677
Yeah.

21:05.420 --> 21:06.849
I wish I could wake up.

21:10.105 --> 21:11.717
Maybe we should try to get some sleep.

21:12.532 --> 21:13.664
You think you can?

21:14.712 --> 21:15.686
Okay.

21:19.769 --> 21:21.626
I’ll just sleep on the floor, alright?

21:21.708 --> 21:22.624
Don’t be stupid.

21:42.350 --> 21:43.416
Look, Peyton.

21:46.073 --> 21:50.472
I just wish there was something I could do, or say to help you through this.

21:51.659 --> 21:52.725
You already have.

21:54.461 --> 21:55.659
Thanks Lucas.

22:06.351 --> 22:07.378
Goodnight.

22:20.352 --> 22:21.663
Sorry you had to see that.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.644
Oh, it’s okay.

22:24.479 --> 22:26.091
It helped me understand you.

22:34.309 --> 22:39.582
You know, growing up, there were just certain things that were just carved into stone.

22:40.167 --> 22:44.519
And the main one was that Dan Scott would have been a pro if he didn’t blow out his knee.

22:46.035 --> 22:51.958
So, all this time, he just has been feeding me this line of crap about how great he would have been.

22:53.545 --> 22:55.512
And how I’d never be as good as him.

22:58.668 --> 22:59.627
Bastard.

23:01.236 --> 23:03.438
At least you know the truth though, right?

23:07.405 --> 23:08.926
I just don’t know what to do with it.

23:10.533 --> 23:13.210
Okay, goodnight.

23:13.491 --> 23:14.281
Goodnight.

23:14.973 --> 23:16.273
I’m here if you need me, okay?

23:22.013 --> 23:25.745
Hey, remember how I said “My family’s so screwed up,

23:26.617 --> 23:28.141
nothing new would make a difference”?

23:28.716 --> 23:29.539
Yeah.

23:31.101 --> 23:31.915
I was wrong.

23:51.074 --> 23:53.564
- You want to hear my side of it?
- Why should I believe it?

23:54.874 --> 23:57.960
This whole time you’ve been riding me you’ve known exactly the way I feel.

23:59.016 --> 24:01.791
Now that that’s in my head it just makes it that much worse.

24:07.609 --> 24:09.231
I was a great player, Nathan.

24:10.055 --> 24:10.977
In high school.

24:12.330 --> 24:15.257
But when I got to Carolina, I knew it wasn’t going to be the same.

24:18.263 --> 24:19.815
My dad couldn’t see it though.

24:20.271 --> 24:21.761
It was hard on your grandmother too.

24:23.066 --> 24:27.838
So when I got hurt, she came to me and pleaded with me to walk away.

24:28.611 --> 24:30.418
She said it would be better for all of us.

24:32.789 --> 24:33.726
So I did.

24:36.537 --> 24:38.048
Worst decision of my life.

24:40.433 --> 24:42.448
It felt good to get out from underneath my father.

24:44.940 --> 24:47.222
And after a while I realized I wasn’t playing for him at all.

24:49.224 --> 24:51.103
The game meant the world to me.

24:52.041 --> 24:54.467
I just never took the time to stand back and realize that.

24:55.983 --> 24:59.229
So I tried to get back into it. Rehab, running, weights.

25:00.494 --> 25:01.435
But it was too late.

25:02.571 --> 25:04.062
My knee never responded.

25:06.576 --> 25:07.698
It was over for me.

25:09.565 --> 25:12.412
So you think that somehow gives you the right to hammer me all the time.

25:13.109 --> 25:14.963
I know I push you. I know I’m hard on you.

25:15.649 --> 25:18.940
But I’m trying to save you from a life of regret. And Trust me, you don’t want it.

25:19.007 --> 25:20.964
So then you make me feel like crap all the time.

25:22.816 --> 25:24.077
That really helps, dad.

25:24.265 --> 25:26.918
I could have been stronger. But I push you so you will be.

25:26.980 --> 25:29.068
So things will end up better for you than they did for me.

25:29.140 --> 25:30.276
Then you’re safe, dad.

25:31.992 --> 25:34.214
There’s no way I’m ever going to end up like you.

25:55.343 --> 25:56.297
Hey.

25:56.903 --> 25:57.602
Hey.

25:58.394 --> 25:59.301
What you got?

26:01.383 --> 26:04.360
‘To my heart, love Dad’

26:05.646 --> 26:07.126
He gave it to me on my last birthday.

26:10.923 --> 26:12.379
What if it’s him, Lucas?

26:13.326 --> 26:15.840
- It’s not gonna be.
- Cause I don’t know what I’d do.

26:16.351 --> 26:17.222
It’s going to be okay.

26:19.484 --> 26:23.229
I just keep trying to picture walking into that room and seeing him lying there.

26:24.503 --> 26:25.706
But I hit a wall.

26:28.389 --> 26:33.662
Why does it seem like every time things are finally going to be okay, something terrible happens?

26:33.878 --> 26:35.648
You don’t know that it has.

26:44.803 --> 26:46.672
Keep him close to your heart, Peyton.

26:49.572 --> 26:50.850
Get some sleep, okay?

27:12.400 --> 27:14.532
You can sleep in the bedroom, I’ll stay out here tonight.

27:19.002 --> 27:27.275
Has it ever once bothered your conscience that our entire relationship is based on your lie?

27:27.740 --> 27:34.720
When you were forced to walk away because of your so-called injury, I dropped out too.

27:34.811 --> 27:37.925
We both dropped out to raise Nathan. Don’t rewrite history.

27:38.242 --> 27:40.489
Oh, so you’re the only one who can play that game?

27:41.408 --> 27:44.648
I thought I knew the man I was choosing to spend my life with.

27:44.965 --> 27:46.471
The injury was real, Deb.

27:47.585 --> 27:50.637
And yes, I decided not to rehab it, at first.

27:51.595 --> 27:53.755
By the time I changed my mind it was too late.

27:54.857 --> 27:57.525
I did it in service to you and Nathan.

27:58.743 --> 28:02.106
Now I know how you’d hold it against me for not telling you, but...

28:02.633 --> 28:04.458
did you ever think that maybe I did it...

28:06.118 --> 28:07.503
to protect you from it all?

28:10.677 --> 28:12.464
If that’s what you need to believe.

28:12.966 --> 28:13.940
It’s the truth.

28:15.859 --> 28:16.939
The truth.

28:18.244 --> 28:19.520
In this house?

28:44.183 --> 28:45.126
What’s all this?

28:45.269 --> 28:48.176
Oh, sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you.

28:48.618 --> 28:49.785
I wasn’t asleep.

28:50.912 --> 28:51.935
I hit the vending machines.

28:53.067 --> 28:53.716
Hungry?

28:56.042 --> 28:57.173
You should probably eat something.

29:02.999 --> 29:07.525
After my mom died, my dad couldn’t cook.

29:07.934 --> 29:11.939
So, we lived on frozen pizzas for the longest time.

29:13.035 --> 29:14.391
I could live on pizza.

29:15.400 --> 29:19.784
He’d buy these cheese pizzas, and then put his own toppings on.

29:20.463 --> 29:23.689
Pickles, bologna, pineapple, whatever.

29:23.966 --> 29:24.862
That’s nasty.

29:25.139 --> 29:27.008
No actually they were really good.

29:29.538 --> 29:31.775
I think he did it mostly just to make me laugh.

29:32.966 --> 29:34.902
You know it would help me forget for a little bit.

29:46.226 --> 29:47.098
You ready?

29:49.551 --> 29:50.187
No.

29:55.091 --> 29:55.987
Let’s go.

30:13.933 --> 30:14.882
Morning.

30:14.986 --> 30:15.687
Morning.

30:16.789 --> 30:18.507
Scrambled or fried? What do you think?

30:19.126 --> 30:22.195
I think nobody’s going to be that hungry.

30:23.546 --> 30:26.127
I’m glad you stood up to Royal the way you did, Deb.

30:27.080 --> 30:32.661
I didn’t mean to hurt Dan but, this lying over the years has gotten so tiresome

30:32.712 --> 30:35.405
I did what I thought I had to do to save my son.

30:36.393 --> 30:37.370
That’s what we do.

30:38.877 --> 30:40.448
I’m glad you spoke up.

30:43.920 --> 30:44.524
Dan.

30:46.910 --> 30:50.968
Son, you know, someday you’re going to realize I did you a favor.

30:51.721 --> 30:54.185
Your daddy’s going to get over this eventually.

30:54.655 --> 30:58.486
But if you let history repeat itself, your son may not.

30:59.300 --> 31:00.376
I’m going for a run.

31:04.236 --> 31:06.801
Oh well. I think I’ll scramble the eggs.

31:07.013 --> 31:07.744
Yeah.

31:13.471 --> 31:14.726
Listen, Nathan,

31:17.118 --> 31:18.613
whatever you’re going through,

31:22.085 --> 31:23.477
I’m sorry about your dad.

31:24.828 --> 31:26.421
I understand why he did it, grandpa.

31:29.662 --> 31:31.326
He must have really loved you, you know that?

31:32.421 --> 31:34.587
Cause anything seemed better than disappointing you.

32:01.869 --> 32:02.885
It’s not him.

32:14.703 --> 32:15.706
You did good.

32:15.969 --> 32:17.820
I felt like my chest was going to explode.

32:27.436 --> 32:29.290
- Peyton’s place.
- Hey, its me.

32:29.356 --> 32:31.416
Hey I was just dialing you, that’s freaky.

32:31.686 --> 32:32.843
Well it’s good news.

32:33.028 --> 32:36.662
Yeah I know, I just got off the phone with the coast guard, they made contact with his boat, he’s fine.

32:38.118 --> 32:39.853
They found your dad, he’s okay.

32:43.874 --> 32:45.111
Alright, we’re headed home.

32:45.455 --> 32:47.732
Okay, I’m waiting. Love you.

32:47.814 --> 32:52.688
- Alright you too. Bye.
- Oh my God, that’s… wait.

32:52.765 --> 32:53.329
What?

32:54.620 --> 32:57.532
My bracelet, I must have left it in the motel.

32:57.901 --> 32:59.063
Alright, lets go.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.102
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:04.153 --> 33:07.941
Grandma’s making breakfast. Show starts at 9. You in?

33:08.038 --> 33:11.868
Um, as fun as last night was, I think I’m going to pass.

33:13.927 --> 33:16.559
You know, I’ve been thinking.

33:17.741 --> 33:22.114
Now that you know the truth about your dad, you’re free, right?

33:22.180 --> 33:26.486
I mean, he’s been lying to you all this time. You don’t have to listen to him anymore.

33:27.444 --> 33:28.617
There’s no more pressure.

33:29.722 --> 33:31.832
Yeah, I wish that were true.

33:32.889 --> 33:33.972
What do you mean?

33:36.565 --> 33:40.689
My dad walked away, and his father will never forgive him for that.

33:41.718 --> 33:42.884
I have to go back.

33:43.147 --> 33:45.338
- Nathan, I…
- I have to beat him, Haley.

33:47.313 --> 33:50.023
It’s the only way I’m ever going to be free of my dad.

33:58.225 --> 33:59.311
It has to be in here.

34:06.990 --> 34:07.937
Got it?

34:11.290 --> 34:12.797
Hey, it’s okay.

34:13.594 --> 34:14.978
Everything’s okay now, okay?

35:43.058 --> 35:46.972
- Ow. Ow. My hair.
- Sorry.

35:50.600 --> 35:51.282
There.

35:56.375 --> 35:57.281
Brooke.

35:59.141 --> 35:59.806
What?

36:03.523 --> 36:05.125
Brooke gave me that necklace.

36:11.613 --> 36:12.607
You know, we…

36:15.145 --> 36:16.501
we probably should get going.

36:18.213 --> 36:18.806
Yeah.

36:21.105 --> 36:21.684
Okay.

36:47.801 --> 36:48.989
How’s business, Keith?

36:50.699 --> 36:51.687
It’s pretty steady.

36:52.636 --> 36:53.224
Good.

36:55.681 --> 36:58.825
I know I rib you a lot son, but I hope you know I think you’re a good man.

37:00.393 --> 37:01.498
That’s great, dad.

37:02.644 --> 37:05.358
The first nice thing you say to me and its really just to dig at Dan.

37:05.440 --> 37:09.142
- Now son…
- Please, could we just eat our breakfast?

37:15.754 --> 37:19.059
Dan, you forgot to open your presents.

37:19.710 --> 37:21.533
This is from your dad and me.

37:23.877 --> 37:25.102
Oh, okay.

37:38.618 --> 37:39.647
What’s this?

37:40.457 --> 37:43.928
It’s a quilt. A lady in Orlando made it.

37:44.541 --> 37:50.174
We still had all your old basketball stuff and I just couldn’t bring myself to throw them out.

37:51.198 --> 37:54.659
You see son, you still have a lot to be proud of.

38:06.667 --> 38:08.022
It’s almost over, Deb.

38:08.519 --> 38:09.620
Thank God for that.

38:14.954 --> 38:19.190
Look, after all that has happened I want to thank you for not throwing gas on the fire.

38:22.340 --> 38:23.224
You okay?

38:24.253 --> 38:28.001
No, no, Dan I’m not. And we’re not.

38:29.639 --> 38:33.331
All this pretending and lying, I can’t really hold it against you.

38:33.403 --> 38:35.702
- Deb…
- Because I realized all these years,

38:38.389 --> 38:39.809
I’ve been doing it too.

39:00.674 --> 39:02.464
- Peyton, I…
- Don’t.

39:04.041 --> 39:07.630
It was stupid. Okay? You’re with Brooke now.

39:09.960 --> 39:10.785
Yeah.

39:10.896 --> 39:15.012
We just got carried away. It didn’t mean anything.

39:17.942 --> 39:18.854
It didn’t?

39:21.738 --> 39:22.796
Of course it did.

39:59.380 --> 40:00.409
See you later.

40:41.570 --> 40:42.403
It’s okay.

40:45.590 --> 40:46.893
Hey you.
