IVámanos!

01:14.312 --> 01:15.478
IVámanos!

02:48.734 --> 02:51.201
I can get you to Texas,
California, Florida.

02:51.203 --> 02:53.381
Unless you got family
somewhere, I'd go to California.

02:53.384 --> 02:55.611
Work all year in California.

02:55.614 --> 02:57.841
Orange card.

02:57.843 --> 03:02.217
Going to California.

03:02.220 --> 03:04.438
Next!

03:17.186 --> 03:19.653
Do you speak English?

03:21.223 --> 03:22.569
He speak English?

03:22.572 --> 03:23.791
Hablas inglés?

03:23.793 --> 03:25.759
No.

03:25.761 --> 03:27.661
You have family where you want to go?

03:27.663 --> 03:30.531
I can get you across
Texas, California, Florida.

03:30.533 --> 03:32.707
Quires ir a Texas,
California, Florida...?

03:32.710 --> 03:34.310
No.

03:34.313 --> 03:37.013
Unless you got family
somewhere, I'd go to California.

03:37.015 --> 03:39.549
Work all year in California.

03:39.551 --> 03:42.252
Quiero ir a Carolina del Norte.

03:42.254 --> 03:44.955
He wants to go to North Carolina.

03:44.957 --> 03:47.294
I know a crew chief in Florida.

03:47.297 --> 03:50.685
Get you there and get you
work, get you someplace to live.

03:50.688 --> 03:53.863
Solamente quiero ir
a Carolina del Norte.

03:53.865 --> 03:56.198
He only wants to go to North Carolina.

03:56.201 --> 03:58.238
Does he have family there?

03:58.240 --> 03:59.706
Tienes familia ahí?

03:59.708 --> 04:02.142
Puedo pagarle para que
me llevan hasta allá.

04:02.144 --> 04:04.346
Says he can pay.

04:04.349 --> 04:05.946
Has he got family?

04:05.948 --> 04:08.515
Tienes familia?

04:11.532 --> 04:15.768
I can get you there, but
it's gonna cost... up front.

04:15.771 --> 04:18.858
Vas a tener que pagarle ahorita.

04:18.861 --> 04:21.228
Le pago.

04:21.230 --> 04:22.796
He says he'll pay.

05:50.419 --> 05:52.419
97.

05:53.689 --> 05:55.088
Can I get your name, please?

05:55.090 --> 05:56.323
Kimara Walters.

05:56.325 --> 05:57.575
How can I help you, Kimara?

05:57.578 --> 05:59.326
Um, I need to pay my cable bill.

05:59.328 --> 06:00.827
Okay. Do you have a copy of the bill

06:00.829 --> 06:02.796
or the phone number
associated with the account?

06:02.798 --> 06:04.597
Yes.

06:12.751 --> 06:13.983
99.

06:13.986 --> 06:16.142
Okay, so, this account has been inactive

06:16.144 --> 06:17.444
for more than 30 days,

06:17.446 --> 06:19.079
so we won't be able to reactivate it

06:19.081 --> 06:22.215
at the basic rate you were paying.

06:22.217 --> 06:24.384
What's the new rate?

06:24.386 --> 06:27.487
Our starter premium
package begins at $59.99.

06:27.489 --> 06:29.615
That includes local channels...

06:29.618 --> 06:32.025
That's twice what I was paying before.

06:32.027 --> 06:34.494
Your account has been
inactive for more than 30 days.

06:36.131 --> 06:39.165
Any account that's been
inactive for more than 30 days,

06:39.167 --> 06:41.067
it's considered fully terminated.

06:41.069 --> 06:43.180
Hi, this is Kimara.

06:45.544 --> 06:47.255
Yes.

06:47.258 --> 06:48.157
Yes.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.779
Um, give me one second.

06:55.751 --> 06:58.184
Ishmael?

06:58.186 --> 07:01.388
How are you doing?

07:01.390 --> 07:03.794
My name is Kimara.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.925
I want you to know
you're not in trouble.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.196
I'm not with the police.

07:10.198 --> 07:11.731
Nobody wants to arrest you...

07:11.733 --> 07:14.601
They only want to arrest your pimp.

07:14.603 --> 07:18.171
And if you let me, I'll do
whatever I can to help you.

07:18.173 --> 07:19.806
I work for Project Open Road.

07:19.808 --> 07:21.241
We're a victims' assistance...

07:21.243 --> 07:23.243
I'm not a victim.

07:23.245 --> 07:24.744
Well, we work with the police

07:24.746 --> 07:26.846
when they have cases like yours,

07:26.848 --> 07:28.415
people who are victims of exploi...

07:28.417 --> 07:29.916
I'm not a victim.

07:34.962 --> 07:38.191
I'm going to ask you some questions.

07:38.193 --> 07:40.326
Is that all right?

07:43.665 --> 07:46.332
Are you from around here?

07:46.334 --> 07:48.701
Did you travel here?

07:50.739 --> 07:53.540
Any family you want to talk to?

07:53.542 --> 07:56.309
Anybody you want us to contact for you?

08:00.158 --> 08:01.524
How old are you?

08:05.572 --> 08:06.905
Over 18?

08:08.825 --> 08:10.224
17?

08:11.828 --> 08:13.461
Under 17?

08:16.299 --> 08:18.199
Would you like to talk
to the police about...

08:18.201 --> 08:19.500
I don't want to talk to them.

08:19.502 --> 08:20.959
If you just tell them about your pimp...

08:20.961 --> 08:22.804
I'm not talking to them.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.339
I'm not telling them nothing.

08:31.446 --> 08:33.279
Do you have any place to stay?

08:35.818 --> 08:37.986
No.

08:37.988 --> 08:40.788
Do you want me to see if I
can get you into a shelter?

08:45.218 --> 08:46.995
I just... I just wish you'd got here,

08:46.997 --> 08:47.996
- like, maybe at 5:00.
- I know.

08:47.998 --> 08:49.297
We were at the police station.

08:49.299 --> 08:50.765
I know. Really, I tried, but...

08:50.767 --> 08:52.000
We don't have any beds.
We're completely full.

08:52.002 --> 08:54.235
Abby... underage, a runaway.

08:54.237 --> 08:57.105
No, I had to turn away a
mother and her two kids.

08:57.107 --> 08:59.140
Her boyfriend is
threatening to kill them all.

08:59.142 --> 09:03.344
I-I just... I don't have anything.

09:05.715 --> 09:08.316
Did you try the Angel Fund Shelter?

09:08.318 --> 09:11.452
They don't shelter boys...
They only shelter women,

09:11.454 --> 09:15.123
and nobody else has any beds open.

09:20.563 --> 09:23.398
Bring him back in the morning,
and I'll see what we have.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.834
I mean... we'll try and get him in.

09:28.938 --> 09:30.338
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:34.911 --> 09:38.579
Okay, come on.

09:41.518 --> 09:44.519
I'm gonna check this
church halfway house.

09:44.521 --> 09:48.790
It's in Gibsonville, but
it's a bed for the night.

09:48.792 --> 09:52.677
I'll find you a better
place in the morning.

09:52.680 --> 09:53.928
I don't have a pimp.

09:55.298 --> 09:57.932
You kept calling Marquis my "pimp."

09:57.934 --> 10:00.868
He ain't no stranger. Marquis is my cuz.

10:00.870 --> 10:04.305
He's been looking out
for me since I was like 6.

10:04.307 --> 10:06.841
He runs you.

10:06.843 --> 10:09.310
He doesn't "run" me.

10:09.313 --> 10:11.517
He sends you out to have sex for money.

10:11.519 --> 10:13.013
I go out.

10:14.417 --> 10:17.718
I go out, do things, and get paid.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.288
And most of the time, I
don't have to do nothing

10:20.290 --> 10:22.457
but... some dude off.

10:24.994 --> 10:28.496
You want me to do
what... Flip them burgers?

10:28.498 --> 10:31.299
Be like these fools
hustling for no money?

10:34.804 --> 10:36.871
I do how I do,

10:36.873 --> 10:42.243
and if there's trouble...
Marquis handles it.

10:44.280 --> 10:47.482
He handles your money, too.

10:47.484 --> 10:51.452
And he tells you when
you can come and go.

10:51.454 --> 10:55.656
And sometimes, when he doesn't
like what you have to say...

10:55.658 --> 10:58.626
what does he do?

10:58.628 --> 11:01.195
Does he beat you?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.500
Does he make you do to him

11:05.502 --> 11:08.202
what you do to those paying customers?

11:15.302 --> 11:19.070
What happens if I get
up and walk out of here?

11:21.580 --> 11:23.747
I'm not a cop.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.083
You're not in trouble.

11:25.086 --> 11:29.357
But you're trying to get... whatever...

11:29.359 --> 11:31.726
Get me into a shelter or whatever.

11:31.728 --> 11:34.729
Yes, I'm trying.

11:34.731 --> 11:36.097
But you don't care.

11:37.233 --> 11:40.601
Ishmael, I do care.

11:40.603 --> 11:42.270
I do.

11:43.506 --> 11:48.142
I have sat here...
I-I mean right here...

11:48.144 --> 11:51.269
With kids your age going
through... through...

11:51.272 --> 11:53.981
You name it, they're going through it.

11:53.983 --> 11:57.385
They're going through worse.

11:57.387 --> 12:00.488
But one day, you figure
out that you can do

12:00.490 --> 12:03.791
and you can do and you
can do and do and do,

12:03.793 --> 12:07.649
but you can't make
somebody else do something.

12:11.834 --> 12:15.903
So, yes, I'm trying to help.

12:15.905 --> 12:21.213
But that's all I can do... is try.

12:43.164 --> 12:44.330
How's your father?

12:44.333 --> 12:47.096
He's... He's been better, honestly.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.619
He's... The years are...
Are catching up to him.

12:49.621 --> 12:51.487
Catching up to all of us.

12:51.489 --> 12:52.989
Well, you tell him I said "hello."

12:52.991 --> 12:54.757
Tell him, as much as I
appreciate the three of you,

12:54.759 --> 12:56.839
I wouldn't mind being across
from him doing business.

12:57.829 --> 13:00.330
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

13:01.633 --> 13:06.336
So... I wish I had something
different to tell you.

13:06.338 --> 13:08.471
But... we're running your numbers,

13:08.473 --> 13:11.708
and the bids coming in
from other produce suppliers

13:11.710 --> 13:12.742
are more competitive.

13:12.744 --> 13:14.577
They're not competitive.

13:14.579 --> 13:18.082
We can't compete with
farms in Mexico and China.

13:18.085 --> 13:20.850
Workers getting paid $2 a day?

13:20.852 --> 13:22.452
$1 to pick tomatoes?

13:22.454 --> 13:23.920
We're not Whole Foods.

13:23.922 --> 13:26.556
Our customers demonstrate
price sensitivity.

13:26.558 --> 13:27.957
They're cheap.

13:27.959 --> 13:29.559
They're value-aware.

13:29.561 --> 13:31.828
And guess what... So am I.

13:31.830 --> 13:33.696
And so are most people.

13:33.698 --> 13:35.698
And your family's been
doing this way too long

13:35.700 --> 13:37.084
to start blaming the customer

13:37.087 --> 13:38.421
for wanting to stretch their dollar.

13:38.423 --> 13:40.498
We don't blame the customer.

13:40.501 --> 13:42.971
The problem is there
aren't 15 or 20 chains

13:42.974 --> 13:45.241
the way there was
when it was dad's farm,

13:45.243 --> 13:47.305
when it was his dad's farm.

13:47.308 --> 13:50.039
There are about five buyers,
and you all control the market.

13:50.042 --> 13:50.830
You know what?

13:50.833 --> 13:55.217
And every year, it's about how
you all can get more for less.

13:55.220 --> 13:58.525
JD, we've been doing
business for a long time.

13:58.528 --> 14:00.520
So I'm gonna put some
numbers in front of you,

14:00.523 --> 14:03.926
and if you can hit the numbers, great.

14:03.928 --> 14:06.062
We can keep doing business.

14:06.064 --> 14:07.730
But if you can't hit the numbers,

14:07.732 --> 14:09.432
then all I can tell you is

14:09.434 --> 14:10.767
I've got guys up in Bentonville,

14:10.769 --> 14:12.201
and they're running their P&L's,

14:12.203 --> 14:14.070
and that's generally
all they care about.

14:14.072 --> 14:18.341
So... you know?

14:18.343 --> 14:19.909
I leave it to you.

14:22.647 --> 14:24.013
I...

14:27.277 --> 14:30.445
Thanks, Flemming.

14:33.348 --> 14:34.514
And he sits there

14:34.516 --> 14:38.151
and pretends to give us
his sympathies for Dad.

14:38.153 --> 14:40.086
He and Dad were friends.

14:40.088 --> 14:43.223
Dad and him did business.

14:43.225 --> 14:46.426
That stretches as far
as a dollar... that's it.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.511
Well, we don't have enough
workers this season as it is.

14:48.513 --> 14:49.596
Well, I don't know why not,

14:49.598 --> 14:51.331
since the borders are so out of control.

14:52.668 --> 14:54.279
How we can get more workers

14:54.282 --> 14:55.902
and how we can get more of them

14:55.904 --> 14:58.538
to do more work for less money...

14:58.540 --> 15:00.874
That's what it comes down to.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.880
Are you all right?

15:06.883 --> 15:10.251
Yeah.

15:10.252 --> 15:12.852
Laurie Anne sounded... Well, not good.

15:12.854 --> 15:15.221
She's just... she's
got a lot of stress...

15:15.223 --> 15:17.023
- I know.
- Taking over for Dad.

15:17.025 --> 15:18.658
I know.

15:27.302 --> 15:31.442
I'm gonna go see my sister Thursday.

15:35.877 --> 15:38.311
Want me to come?

15:39.414 --> 15:41.915
No. You don't have to.

15:41.917 --> 15:43.783
I just wanted to let you know.

15:43.785 --> 15:46.386
Tell Raelyn... Tell her I said "hello."

15:53.095 --> 15:56.229
It's a numbers game at this point.

15:56.231 --> 15:58.798
It's volume.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.101
We need people.

16:01.103 --> 16:04.771
And we need people who
can work the fields.

16:04.773 --> 16:08.508
And we need people...

16:08.510 --> 16:12.712
We need them to work at a price.

16:12.714 --> 16:16.049
So, I'm saying...

16:16.051 --> 16:20.120
I'm saying get people in, okay?

16:20.122 --> 16:22.789
Get them in, get them on the farm,

16:22.791 --> 16:24.924
and get them working.

16:25.596 --> 16:27.095
All right, guys,

16:27.098 --> 16:31.398
you need to get me the
trabajadores, the obreros.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.144
I need workers, all right?

16:33.147 --> 16:35.601
Now, I don't give a damn if
they've done it before or not.

16:35.604 --> 16:38.071
If they can stand up and they can pick,

16:38.073 --> 16:40.073
I want you to get them for me.

16:40.075 --> 16:41.307
Let's go!

16:41.309 --> 16:42.609
- And they need to want money...
- You understand?

16:42.611 --> 16:44.277
- Move if you want work!
- Let's go! Let's go!

16:44.279 --> 16:45.545
They got to want to hustle.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.213
Hey, come here for a second.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.581
You bring me in people
who want to hustle.

16:48.583 --> 16:50.817
You looking for work? Buscan jale?

16:50.819 --> 16:52.018
All right?

16:52.020 --> 16:53.219
Now, times are tough.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.155
- You can make like $200 a day.
- A day?

16:55.157 --> 16:56.589
There are a whole lot
of people out there,

16:56.591 --> 16:57.624
and they need money.

16:57.626 --> 16:59.392
You can make like $150.

16:59.394 --> 17:00.760
I thought you said $200.

17:00.762 --> 17:02.262
Those are the people we're looking for.

17:02.264 --> 17:05.064
I-It's just how much you
pick... that... that's it.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.398
All right, you find
them, and you get them in.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.067
Where you headed?

17:09.871 --> 17:11.471
Patterson.

17:11.473 --> 17:13.440
Want a ride?

17:14.776 --> 17:16.742
No.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.310
It's hot out.

17:18.313 --> 17:21.047
You walking all the way to Patterson?

17:23.050 --> 17:25.318
You want a drink?

17:25.319 --> 17:26.653
It's hot out.

17:26.655 --> 17:29.088
You want something to drink?

17:34.162 --> 17:35.695
You walking all the way to Patterson.

17:35.697 --> 17:38.064
It must take you an hour to walk there.

17:39.167 --> 17:41.367
What's going on in Patterson?

17:41.369 --> 17:43.470
I got friends.

17:44.806 --> 17:48.241
Must be some friends...
You walking an hour.

17:48.243 --> 17:50.243
They're good friends?

17:51.980 --> 17:54.614
Not really friends...
It's, um, this dude...

17:54.616 --> 17:58.818
He, he's got some scrips.

17:58.820 --> 17:59.919
Yeah?

18:02.157 --> 18:05.859
A little Roxi, gets them
to me cheap, you know?

18:21.333 --> 18:23.427
Go for it, man.

18:27.115 --> 18:29.393
If you need some helping out,
I could help you out some.

18:31.553 --> 18:34.754
You could earn some money.

18:34.756 --> 18:36.189
Doing what?

18:36.191 --> 18:37.257
Pick tomatoes.

18:38.727 --> 18:40.527
Why are you laughing?

18:42.864 --> 18:46.533
Wait... you sit there, drinking my beer,

18:46.535 --> 18:47.834
talking about how you're gonna walk

18:47.836 --> 18:49.235
all the way to Patterson

18:49.237 --> 18:51.371
to score some drugs
with money you ain't got,

18:51.373 --> 18:54.307
a-and you're gonna laugh?

18:54.309 --> 18:56.676
No, no. I'm...

18:58.046 --> 18:59.445
What's funny?

19:00.916 --> 19:03.416
Just, tomatoes... It sounds dumb.

19:03.418 --> 19:05.018
It's hard work.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.020
It's good work.

19:07.022 --> 19:09.522
See, I started picking,
but I don't pick no more

19:09.524 --> 19:12.959
'cause I made something of myself.

19:12.961 --> 19:16.796
So, you, you got a farm?

19:16.798 --> 19:19.265
No, this family that I work for...

19:19.267 --> 19:22.602
They got a bunch of
farms... A bunch of 'em.

19:22.604 --> 19:24.003
And these farms got crew chiefs

19:24.005 --> 19:27.106
that got all these guys
like me and my brother.

19:27.108 --> 19:28.408
Your brother?

19:28.410 --> 19:30.209
That's cool, working with your brother.

19:30.211 --> 19:32.078
Yeah, we're captains.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.513
So, me and Diego, we got to go out

19:33.515 --> 19:35.815
and get people to work the fields.

19:35.817 --> 19:37.150
It's good work.

19:37.152 --> 19:40.186
You could make like $200 a day picking.

19:40.188 --> 19:41.621
$200?

19:41.623 --> 19:43.489
Depends on how much you pick,

19:43.491 --> 19:46.726
but, yeah, you can make some money.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.969
How 'bout you? Y-You
got family around here?

19:58.018 --> 19:59.005
No.

19:59.007 --> 20:00.506
Nobody?

20:00.508 --> 20:02.375
I-I don't really got people.

20:02.377 --> 20:04.477
I got...

20:04.479 --> 20:07.213
I got a brother, but not like you.

20:07.215 --> 20:11.784
He... He... He don't
want nothing to do with me.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.221
Sorry to hear about that, man.

20:15.223 --> 20:18.091
That's how it is. It's
nothing to be sorry about.

20:19.494 --> 20:23.529
Look... how 'bout you come
work on the farm, get paid?

20:23.531 --> 20:25.365
Got a place to live out there, too.

20:25.367 --> 20:28.167
No rent, just get yourself settled.

20:28.169 --> 20:29.769
You need beer... I got that.

20:29.771 --> 20:33.106
You need other stuff,
I can get that, too.

20:39.581 --> 20:40.947
Look, hit me up.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.548
Pass those around if you know people.

20:42.550 --> 20:45.103
Looking to hire.

20:45.106 --> 20:46.686
Finish those, man.

20:46.688 --> 20:48.132
It's all yours.

21:03.455 --> 21:05.379
I'm gonna give you some rouge, okay?

21:05.381 --> 21:06.513
Y-You like rouge?

21:06.515 --> 21:08.015
Sure.

21:13.289 --> 21:15.088
You have beautiful skin.

21:15.090 --> 21:17.090
Thank you.

21:17.092 --> 21:19.593
You're either born
with it or you're not.

21:19.595 --> 21:22.329
Bet your mother's got great skin, too.

21:22.331 --> 21:24.431
I guess.

21:24.433 --> 21:26.266
What about mascara?

21:26.268 --> 21:27.701
I don't use it much.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.735
You like this?

21:28.737 --> 21:30.037
Yeah, sure.

21:33.142 --> 21:36.009
You about done?

21:36.011 --> 21:38.745
You almost done?

21:38.747 --> 21:40.147
Almost.

21:43.652 --> 21:44.851
Is that your boyfriend?

21:44.853 --> 21:45.978
Yeah.

21:45.981 --> 21:47.452
Everything all right with you?

21:47.455 --> 21:48.755
- Yeah.
- You sure?

21:48.757 --> 21:51.525
I just... we're having
dinner with his sister...

21:51.527 --> 21:53.694
His sister and her fiancé.

21:53.696 --> 21:55.562
And we're going to this, you know...

21:55.564 --> 21:57.064
really nice restaurant.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.198
Special occasion.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.100
He just wants me to look good.

22:00.102 --> 22:02.402
Well, you can learn to do
this yourself, you know?

22:02.404 --> 22:05.339
Not that hard, just a little practice.

22:05.341 --> 22:08.709
It's good to be able to
make yourself look pretty.

22:08.711 --> 22:11.378
Now, what about those lips?

22:28.864 --> 22:30.664
- You're early.
- Is that okay?

22:30.666 --> 22:33.200
Yeah, come on.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.637
It's nice.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.475
"Nice"?

22:41.477 --> 22:44.444
You don't get around much?

22:44.446 --> 22:46.013
I have to make a call.

22:46.015 --> 22:47.214
Yeah.

22:47.216 --> 22:48.849
Whatever you got to do.

22:48.851 --> 22:51.118
- You want a drink or something?
- No, I'm good.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.953
You sure?

22:59.728 --> 23:03.030
Hey. I'm here.

23:03.032 --> 23:04.264
Yeah.

23:05.752 --> 23:06.985
Okay.

23:10.873 --> 23:11.605
We good?

23:11.607 --> 23:13.373
Everything's good.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.075
You care for some music or anything?

23:15.077 --> 23:16.076
You want some music?

23:16.078 --> 23:17.078
Pick something.

23:18.461 --> 23:22.015
It's going kind of old-school.

23:26.255 --> 23:27.921
What's up with your face?

23:27.923 --> 23:29.923
What's all that?

23:29.925 --> 23:32.759
When you answered the ad,
you said you liked makeup.

23:32.761 --> 23:34.327
Never said that.

23:34.329 --> 23:36.530
You look like you're 30.

23:36.532 --> 23:38.298
How old are you?

23:38.300 --> 23:39.300
18.

23:41.437 --> 23:43.070
Good answer.

23:43.072 --> 23:46.073
You look like you're 30.

23:46.075 --> 23:48.308
Hold on.

24:13.417 --> 24:16.636
Wipe all that off, okay?

24:16.638 --> 24:18.071
Take it off.

24:22.010 --> 24:23.376
Don't rush.

24:32.387 --> 24:33.735
Do a good job.

25:12.596 --> 25:14.361
I found this thing on the Internet.

25:14.363 --> 25:15.503
What is it?

25:15.506 --> 25:17.597
It's a list of words, of
things that people feel,

25:17.599 --> 25:19.132
but they can't explain.

25:19.134 --> 25:22.144
Okay...

25:22.147 --> 25:23.970
So...

25:23.972 --> 25:27.207
"Onism... the frustration of being..."

25:27.209 --> 25:28.108
What?

25:28.110 --> 25:29.442
They're made-up words.

25:31.847 --> 25:35.782
"Onism... the frustration
of being trapped in a body

25:35.784 --> 25:38.852
that can only exist in
one place at a time."

25:40.722 --> 25:43.023
"Nodus tollens..."

25:43.025 --> 25:44.724
The realization that
the story of your life

25:44.726 --> 25:46.426
"doesn't make sense to you anymore."

25:46.428 --> 25:48.094
My God.

25:48.096 --> 25:52.432
That's me.

25:52.434 --> 25:55.936
"Énou... énouement."

25:55.938 --> 25:58.133
I think that's how it's pronounced.

25:58.136 --> 26:03.176
"The pleasure and sadness
of arriving in the future,"

26:03.178 --> 26:04.844
but not being able
to tell your past self

26:04.846 --> 26:07.013
"of all the things you've discovered."

26:49.725 --> 26:51.958
Why you glum?

26:55.797 --> 27:00.934
Why... you... glum?

27:02.640 --> 27:03.973
I'm not.

27:07.439 --> 27:08.731
I'm not.

27:36.486 --> 27:38.720
How are you feeling?

27:38.722 --> 27:40.555
I don't know.

27:40.557 --> 27:41.990
How am I feeling?

27:41.992 --> 27:43.858
Well, I hope you're
feeling good, physically.

27:45.095 --> 27:47.462
But I'm sorry... I do
have disappointing news.

27:47.464 --> 27:50.699
The IVF treatment didn't take.

27:50.701 --> 27:51.967
You're not pregnant.

27:55.023 --> 27:56.656
Okay.

27:56.659 --> 27:57.991
There are a number of factors

27:57.994 --> 28:00.709
that may have caused the
cycle to be unsuccessful.

28:00.711 --> 28:04.245
The risk of a chromosomal
abnormality is significant,

28:04.247 --> 28:06.681
so the embryo itself
may have been nonviable.

28:06.683 --> 28:07.816
There may have been

28:07.818 --> 28:09.784
an underlying implantation disfunction.

28:09.786 --> 28:11.987
And, technically, it's not a failure.

28:11.989 --> 28:13.755
Every woman's biology is different

28:13.757 --> 28:15.590
and responds to
medications and protoco...

28:19.329 --> 28:20.628
Come here!

28:20.630 --> 28:21.997
- Give me a kiss.
- Auntie!

28:21.999 --> 28:23.765
Hi.

28:23.767 --> 28:25.033
You can take this.

28:25.035 --> 28:26.568
Hi, love. How are you?

28:26.570 --> 28:27.769
Mwah!

28:35.779 --> 28:38.380
Wow, like Christmas in July.

28:38.382 --> 28:40.148
You girls thank your auntie?

28:40.150 --> 28:42.250
Hi.

28:42.252 --> 28:43.618
Let me get this.

28:54.078 --> 28:56.731
How long has it been?

28:56.733 --> 28:58.366
Three weeks.

28:58.368 --> 28:59.656
And nothing?

28:59.659 --> 29:01.369
He hasn't tried to
get in touch with you?

29:01.371 --> 29:02.504
He hasn't...

29:02.506 --> 29:04.539
He just left.

29:04.542 --> 29:06.335
Why didn't you call me?

29:06.338 --> 29:07.838
And say what?

29:07.840 --> 29:13.480
That your husband... you
don't have to do things alone.

29:13.483 --> 29:14.716
I know.

29:14.718 --> 29:15.683
I can help.

29:15.685 --> 29:17.852
I know you can.

29:20.157 --> 29:21.389
Did he say anything?

29:21.391 --> 29:22.824
Is it... Is...

29:24.261 --> 29:26.127
Was it a woman?

29:32.404 --> 29:34.137
You're better off without him.

29:34.139 --> 29:35.471
You are.

29:35.473 --> 29:37.173
He's got two kids.

29:37.175 --> 29:39.943
If he can't be around
for his own girls...

29:39.945 --> 29:42.812
Well... he was around when I wasn't,

29:42.814 --> 29:45.148
so he's got that.

29:51.256 --> 29:52.722
How's everything with you?

29:52.724 --> 29:55.658
Things are... You know...

29:55.660 --> 29:57.360
They're okay.

29:59.674 --> 30:02.641
You don't got to pretend
they aren't just for me.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.135
Carson's father's not doing too good,

30:06.137 --> 30:10.840
but, otherwise... things are okay.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.658
Nothing to talk about?

30:31.196 --> 30:33.997
You should bring the girls
out to the house sometime.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.199
I'm not doing that to you.

30:36.201 --> 30:37.633
I can get by.

30:37.635 --> 30:39.936
It's not about just getting by.

30:39.938 --> 30:44.607
I want you around
more... Spend more time...

30:46.544 --> 30:47.877
I don't want to drive out here

30:47.879 --> 30:49.212
and listen to how your husband left you

30:49.214 --> 30:50.346
and not know what to say

30:50.348 --> 30:52.281
'cause we don't know each other anymore.

30:53.689 --> 30:54.689
Well, we don't.

31:02.342 --> 31:03.775
It's been three weeks.

31:03.778 --> 31:05.928
You know, he is... He
is a son of a bitch.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.563
That's pretty much what I told her.

31:07.565 --> 31:09.165
Does she... Are...
Are... Are the kids okay?

31:09.167 --> 31:10.366
I guess.

31:10.368 --> 31:13.102
I mean, I don't know how she's gonna...

31:13.104 --> 31:16.773
$7.25 an hour, working part time.

31:18.043 --> 31:21.911
Do you think... Do you think
we could talk to Laurie Ann?

31:21.913 --> 31:24.013
- No.
- Just... Well, just... just listen

31:24.015 --> 31:25.581
before you... Before you answer.

31:25.583 --> 31:27.316
The answer is "no."

31:27.318 --> 31:29.519
The answer you're gonna
get from Laurie Ann is "no."

31:29.521 --> 31:30.620
Raelyn needs help.

31:30.622 --> 31:31.821
Well, I understand that.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.756
She's clean. She...

31:33.758 --> 31:36.392
They... They give her random
drug tests at her work.

31:36.394 --> 31:38.027
That doesn't mean she's clean?

31:38.029 --> 31:40.396
That just means she
hasn't been caught again.

31:40.398 --> 31:41.497
She's my sister.

31:41.499 --> 31:43.066
And we tried to help her once.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.268
How many times does she
have to say she's sorry?

31:45.270 --> 31:46.335
If you want... If you want to,

31:46.337 --> 31:47.970
you know, send her a check.

31:47.972 --> 31:49.772
I want to get her a job.

31:49.774 --> 31:51.707
I-I want to get her a decent job.

31:51.709 --> 31:53.276
Yeah, well, it's not
gonna be on the farm.

31:53.278 --> 31:55.778
Well, if you talk to Laurie Ann
and you could just tell her...

31:55.780 --> 31:58.748
I'm not doing that.
Your sister stole money.

32:00.318 --> 32:04.187
She stole money from my
dad after he gave her work.

32:04.189 --> 32:05.488
She did that to him.

32:05.490 --> 32:06.789
She did that to you.

32:06.791 --> 32:07.990
Raelyn wasn't well.

32:07.992 --> 32:09.926
I mean, she had problems. She... She...

32:09.928 --> 32:10.993
Problems.

32:10.995 --> 32:12.095
She wasn't well.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.463
I meant what I said...

32:13.465 --> 32:16.065
If you want to write her a check.

32:16.067 --> 32:18.935
Just giving her money isn't
the same as helping her.

32:58.643 --> 32:59.876
You speak English?

33:27.839 --> 33:29.038
No, no, no.

34:17.789 --> 34:19.355
Sí.

34:20.958 --> 34:23.125
Tuteo, aquí.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.465
Ustedes dos...

35:25.927 --> 35:28.113
Hey.

35:34.254 --> 35:35.820
I don't... I don't...

35:46.566 --> 35:48.600
Hey.

35:49.970 --> 35:52.871
Hey, doggie. Hey.

35:52.873 --> 35:54.572
- What's his name?
- Bales.

35:54.574 --> 35:55.907
Bales?

35:55.909 --> 35:58.576
Hey, Bales.

35:58.578 --> 35:59.778
What are you doing?

35:59.780 --> 36:01.279
Just hanging.

36:01.281 --> 36:02.947
You want something to eat?

36:02.949 --> 36:04.282
You can have it.

36:04.284 --> 36:06.117
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:06.119 --> 36:07.719
Take it.

36:12.318 --> 36:14.459
You want to come hang
out with me and my guy?

36:14.461 --> 36:16.928
We got an apartment.

36:16.930 --> 36:18.863
He's cool.

36:18.865 --> 36:21.232
I live there with my girlfriends.

36:23.009 --> 36:24.108
We got weed.

36:30.969 --> 36:33.136
Nah.

36:33.139 --> 36:34.712
Just come hang out.

36:36.349 --> 36:37.615
I'm good.

36:41.254 --> 36:43.388
Bye, Bales.

36:43.390 --> 36:45.056
See you.

37:43.756 --> 37:45.717
It's pretty?

37:45.719 --> 37:48.553
What is it?

37:48.555 --> 37:50.922
Just something I found online.

37:52.726 --> 37:54.926
Shae.

37:54.928 --> 37:57.095
Let's go.

37:57.097 --> 37:59.030
Come on, get dressed. Let's go.

38:19.486 --> 38:21.619
Have I been here before?

38:21.621 --> 38:22.587
I don't know.

38:22.589 --> 38:24.155
I guess.

38:25.859 --> 38:28.326
I feel like I've been here.

38:28.328 --> 38:29.861
Okay.

38:31.798 --> 38:33.264
Can you go with me?

38:33.266 --> 38:34.866
With you?

38:34.868 --> 38:37.001
And do what?

38:38.797 --> 38:40.763
Call me when you get in there.

38:43.276 --> 38:44.676
Get your ass up.

38:44.678 --> 38:46.044
Go do some work.

39:28.421 --> 39:30.555
Yeah, you got the money?

39:32.859 --> 39:34.325
Okay.

39:35.695 --> 39:36.694
It's all good?

39:36.696 --> 39:38.529
Yes.

39:45.138 --> 39:47.071
Can I have a drink?

39:48.375 --> 39:50.375
I don't have anything.

39:52.512 --> 39:54.112
Can I just...

39:55.181 --> 39:56.814
Can we go get a beer?

40:01.087 --> 40:03.021
You like that?

40:05.458 --> 40:07.725
Yeah.

40:07.727 --> 40:09.861
Yeah?

40:09.863 --> 40:11.896
You like it?

40:13.266 --> 40:14.799
You like that?

40:24.577 --> 40:28.346
Come on.

40:28.348 --> 40:29.647
Come on.

40:34.921 --> 40:36.220
Freeze!

40:36.222 --> 40:37.188
Get your hands up!

40:37.190 --> 40:38.322
- Dude, what's going on?!
- Freeze!

40:38.324 --> 40:39.257
- Get down!
- Dude, what's going on?!

40:39.259 --> 40:40.658
Get your hands up!

40:40.660 --> 40:42.560
You all right?

40:42.562 --> 40:44.228
Come on, man!

40:44.230 --> 40:45.630
Other hand.

40:45.632 --> 40:47.799
Check to see if the girl's okay.

40:49.235 --> 40:52.770
I got his hands. Going! Come on!

41:00.711 --> 41:02.344
Shae?

41:02.347 --> 41:05.550
My name is Kimara.

41:05.552 --> 41:08.573
I want you to know
you're not in trouble.

41:08.576 --> 41:10.776
I'm not with the police.

41:10.779 --> 41:14.659
Nobody wants to arrest you.

41:14.662 --> 41:17.743
If you let me, I'll do
everything I can to help you.
