00:17.117 --> 00:19.108
Get out of my way.

00:22.555 --> 00:24.989
All right, rich boy, there you go.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.723
Come on.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.138
Next.

01:41.468 --> 01:43.698
Well, look who it is.

01:43.870 --> 01:46.839
-Hiya, freak!
-Van, back off!

01:47.340 --> 01:50.002
You're the one
that should be in here!

01:50.944 --> 01:53.708
You're the one
that should be in here!

01:53.880 --> 01:56.542
They should lock you up, you freak!

01:57.717 --> 02:00.208
Hey, Kent. It's me, Eric.

02:00.386 --> 02:02.320
Been struck by lightning lately?

02:08.627 --> 02:10.425
Good to see you, Clark.

02:10.597 --> 02:13.157
Tell my two favorite ex-girlfriends
I said hello.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.324
Keep moving, lan.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.799
Jeez, kid. You seem to know
a lot of people in here.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.702
Where's Lex?

02:26.980 --> 02:29.312
You got 1 0 minutes.

02:40.793 --> 02:42.021
Lex?

02:43.229 --> 02:46.562
Clark, I was wondering
if I'd ever see you again.

02:46.733 --> 02:50.499
I've been trying to visit you. The doctors
said you weren't ready to see anyone.

02:53.039 --> 02:55.940
-Are you okay?
-I know your secret.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.116
Don't worry.
I haven't said a word to anyone.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.447
I need you to get me out of here.

03:09.622 --> 03:11.852
I've seen what you can do.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.721
That car hit you
at 60 miles an hour...

03:14.894 --> 03:16.794
...and you tossed it like a toy.

03:16.963 --> 03:19.659
Breaking me out's not gonna be
too much of a challenge.

03:19.832 --> 03:22.528
-Lex, I want to--
-Then do it, Clark.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.262
My father's never gonna let me out.

03:27.807 --> 03:29.672
You're my friend.

03:30.009 --> 03:32.034
Please, Clark.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.772
Don't let me rot in this cesspool.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.883
I'm sorry.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.023
-Hey!
-Come on!

03:50.196 --> 03:52.289
Get that bastard out of my sight!

03:54.100 --> 03:57.228
I'll never forgive you
for this, Clark! Never!

03:59.339 --> 04:01.273
Never!

04:03.810 --> 04:05.903
Save me.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.944
Save me.

04:16.154 --> 04:18.180
Get up, Curly.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.449
Time for your 9:00 meds.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.126
Get up.

04:41.414 --> 04:42.642
Oh, God!

05:06.406 --> 05:08.306
Hey, Luthor!

05:09.976 --> 05:12.342
What are you doing here, my friend?

05:16.015 --> 05:18.677
I'm gonna take you back
to your room, okay?

05:18.851 --> 05:20.375
Just relax.

07:26.646 --> 07:30.138
I've never seen Lex so angry with me.
It's like he just went....

07:30.316 --> 07:32.079
Crazy?

07:32.819 --> 07:34.844
Well, you can't take it
personally, Clark.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.756
It was hard not to.
He asked me to break him out.

07:39.358 --> 07:41.223
You said no, didn't you?

07:41.794 --> 07:43.056
Yeah.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.159
-Well, that's good.
-Yeah, it's great.

07:46.332 --> 07:49.790
He just broke himself out,
injured two guards along the way.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.096
He doesn't belong in there.
He's being drugged.

07:52.271 --> 07:56.264
Well, we don't know that for sure.
This isn't his first brush with mental illness.

07:57.276 --> 08:00.177
Well, Lionel's never gonna let him out.
I'm his only chance.

08:00.746 --> 08:03.442
You can't just break somebody
out of a state institution.

08:03.616 --> 08:07.279
Then you'd go to jail, and Lex would be
out there, a fugitive with your secret.

08:07.453 --> 08:10.684
-Pete knows, and that's turned out okay.
-Lex is different.

08:11.624 --> 08:14.889
Look, I'm not saying you should put
your secret above Lex's well-being.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.552
I just think that you should stay out
of this one.

08:17.730 --> 08:18.924
-Dad--
-Clark.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.362
You don't know everything
that's going on here.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.893
Now, if you get involved--

08:24.070 --> 08:26.231
It could just get worse.

08:46.792 --> 08:50.626
You know, you've got another friend
in a hospital that you haven't visited.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.388
Lana doesn't wanna see me
right now.

08:52.565 --> 08:55.090
She was in shock, Clark.
She didn't mean what she said.

08:55.268 --> 08:58.931
Except she's right.
All I've done is put her in danger.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.403
She's better off without me.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.532
What about you?
Are you better off?

09:05.711 --> 09:08.339
You know, you can save
the whole world, Clark...

09:08.514 --> 09:11.449
...but you gotta take care
of your own heart too.

09:11.784 --> 09:13.809
Go see her.

09:23.863 --> 09:27.162
Good, Lana. One more step.

09:30.836 --> 09:34.328
Okay.
Okay, that's enough for today.

09:34.507 --> 09:37.305
It goes for you too, Adam.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.609
I know my limits.

09:39.779 --> 09:42.111
If you overdo it,
you'll undo all your hard work.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.942
If I listened to people like you,
I'd still be in bed.

09:47.119 --> 09:50.145
-Good work today, sweetie.
-Thanks.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.323
Hurts, doesn't it?

09:55.094 --> 09:57.119
Like you wouldn't believe.

09:57.530 --> 10:00.931
I think you're getting off
way too easily.

10:01.100 --> 10:05.002
-Excuse me?
-You have to learn to push through the pain.

10:05.671 --> 10:10.404
If we all sat down every time it hurt,
this country never would've been built.

10:10.576 --> 10:14.512
Well, I doubt the Founding Fathers
broke their legs in four places.

10:14.847 --> 10:17.873
What happened, bad pileup
in cheerleading practice?

10:18.451 --> 10:20.510
No, no, seriously.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.913
How'd you end up in here?

10:24.724 --> 10:27.955
A horse got spooked.
I ended up under its hooves.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.923
I'm guessing that's not
a good place to be.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.961
I'm Adam.

10:36.736 --> 10:38.260
Lana.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.239
All right, Lana.

10:42.742 --> 10:46.337
We both know that you have
one more lap in you in this puppy.

10:46.846 --> 10:49.337
-Let's see it.
-How about not?

10:49.615 --> 10:53.051
I know "struggle" is probably
not in your vocabulary...

10:53.219 --> 10:55.483
...but just to let you know,
here, it's credo.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.021
For your information,
I haven't walked in a month.

10:58.190 --> 11:02.024
Feeling sorry for yourself may work now,
but it won't get you up a flight of stairs.

11:02.194 --> 11:04.822
-Are you always this obnoxious?
-I'm telling you how it is.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.124
No one's ever honest
with girls like you.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.431
I bet you have a boyfriend
that's always protecting you, right?

11:11.737 --> 11:12.795
But he's not here.

11:12.972 --> 11:17.671
No one's gonna fight this battle for you.
You're on your own. See you around.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.891
Hello, Lex.

11:47.006 --> 11:50.533
You were making such good progress, son.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.772
You're the one who taught me:

11:53.612 --> 11:55.910
Attack adversity head-on.

11:58.150 --> 12:02.246
And had you been taking your medication,
you would've done just that.

12:03.189 --> 12:07.626
This institution is not your adversary, Lex.

12:07.793 --> 12:09.590
Your illness is the enemy.

12:10.963 --> 12:13.261
But I'm better now.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.299
I don't need the meds.

12:16.702 --> 12:19.694
That story about
you killing your parents...

12:19.872 --> 12:22.306
...was nothing more than
a paranoid delusion.

12:22.975 --> 12:27.878
See, somewhere along the line,
I veered off into the abyss...

12:28.481 --> 12:30.972
...but I've managed
to claw my way back.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.452
But that's irrelevant now.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.891
What do you mean?

12:41.393 --> 12:45.489
When your attempt to escape failed...

12:45.664 --> 12:49.225
...you sabotaged my efforts
to have you released...

12:49.468 --> 12:51.163
...to be cared for at home.

12:51.704 --> 12:55.265
But I told you, I'm cured.

12:56.008 --> 12:59.000
A cured patient doesn't belong
in a hospital.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.116
Oh, it's painful to see you like this.

13:15.060 --> 13:17.927
You know I have your best interest
at heart, don't you?

13:19.431 --> 13:21.991
The only interest you have...

13:23.736 --> 13:25.533
...is staying out of prison.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.771
I'm not insane, and you know it.

13:30.409 --> 13:33.845
It's sad to see a man
who's lost his mind.

13:34.780 --> 13:38.272
But it's tragic when he's convinced
himself that he's sane.

13:39.251 --> 13:41.378
You son of a bitch.

13:43.956 --> 13:47.824
You did this to me.
You're the one who's insane!

13:50.296 --> 13:52.628
You did this to me!

14:05.878 --> 14:09.370
Well, if it isn't Ku Klux Van.

14:09.548 --> 14:12.711
-Get out of my grill, freaks.
-I'd watch your mouth if I were you.

14:12.885 --> 14:16.218
Yeah, we heard about your little
one-man ethnic-cleansing campaign.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.848
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Come on.

14:20.059 --> 14:21.788
You were picking off meteor freaks...

14:21.961 --> 14:24.759
...Iike ducks on the first day
of hunting season.

14:24.930 --> 14:27.057
And now you're stuck in here
with all us ducks.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.190
Quack, quack.

14:30.669 --> 14:32.068
We don't wanna hurt you, Van.

14:32.238 --> 14:36.038
-The three of us have something in common.
-I seriously doubt that.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.698
Clark Kent put us all in here.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.173
And word on the ward
is you know his weakness.

14:41.347 --> 14:43.577
-Why should I tell you?
-Well, because.

14:43.782 --> 14:46.615
We're looking to sample
the sweet taste of revenge.

14:46.785 --> 14:50.016
If you weaken him, I can leech his powers
and break us out of here.

14:50.589 --> 14:52.454
Wait, you took Clark's powers?

14:52.625 --> 14:54.957
-How?
-It's a lightning strike.

14:55.127 --> 14:57.994
He took them back
with a high-voltage shock.

15:02.001 --> 15:04.128
How do I know I can trust you freaks?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.532
The enemy of your enemy
is your friend.

15:18.550 --> 15:21.314
I don't feel comfortable moving forward
with the procedure.

15:21.487 --> 15:24.786
Comfortable? Your comfort level
is of no concern to me, doctor.

15:24.957 --> 15:28.620
I've indulged you for a month
while you've conducted this drug therapy...

15:28.794 --> 15:31.695
...and not only does Lex's memory
remain completely intact...

15:31.864 --> 15:34.389
...but he attempted to escape.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.329
I can't afford to waste any more time.

15:36.502 --> 15:39.869
Mr. Luthor, the procedure
you're proposing is Draconian.

15:40.039 --> 15:42.473
It's successful in less than 50 percent
of patients.

15:42.641 --> 15:47.010
It leaves the other half with irreparable brain
damage. Are you willing to take that risk?

15:47.179 --> 15:50.273
No risk, no reward.
Isn't that what they say, doctor?

15:50.449 --> 15:54.146
Performing this procedure on a patient
who doesn't require it is unconscionable.

15:54.320 --> 15:58.518
But it's not the first time.
You've experimented with it before.

15:58.924 --> 16:00.585
We had a mutual agreement,
didn't we?

16:00.759 --> 16:03.887
I strongly suggest you keep
your part of the bargain.

16:04.063 --> 16:07.260
So start the procedure immediately.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.574
Clark, turn a light on.
It's bad for your eyes.

16:16.742 --> 16:18.334
Why are you working so late?

16:18.510 --> 16:20.876
Trying to prove Lex doesn't belong
in Belle Reve.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.981
-And what'd you find on Lex?
-Well, I have his medical records.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.447
Dr. Foster's definitely drugging him.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.487
There are millions of reasons
why she could be administering this drug.

16:31.957 --> 16:35.358
Psychotherapy is just trial and error.
This doesn't prove anything.

16:36.261 --> 16:39.321
I know.
But I gotta do something.

16:40.399 --> 16:43.835
Well, why don't we work on this
in the morning. This is just a pit stop.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.836
I have to pick up Lana on my way home.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.107
How is Lana?

16:52.211 --> 16:54.042
It's been really tough.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.711
She could use some moral support.

16:59.218 --> 17:00.810
I sent her a card.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.679
Nothing says, "l love you,"
more than a $1.50 piece of cardboard.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.349
If she wanted me there, Chloe,
I'd be there.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.463
Right now, I'm just trying
to keep my promises for once.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.499
Keep me posted on the 'Free Lex" front.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.105
Chloe, wait.

17:22.708 --> 17:26.769
Dr. Foster has recommended Lex
for radical electroshock therapy.

17:27.346 --> 17:29.906
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

17:30.082 --> 17:31.572
It is.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.308
Memory loss is almost a given...

17:33.485 --> 17:37.546
...and if things don't go exactly as planned,
Lex could turn out a vegetable.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.714
When does this happen?

17:39.958 --> 17:42.085
Twenty-four hours.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.064
Is that my package?

17:50.235 --> 17:53.204
I still don't get what you want
with one of these rocks.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.710
How about we just
forget the whole thing?

18:06.485 --> 18:09.249
Whatever floats your boat, my man.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.962
So did you get
what you were waiting for?

18:25.337 --> 18:27.066
It's in the box.

18:27.473 --> 18:28.804
When Kent comes back...

18:28.974 --> 18:31.943
...he's gonna have a little surprise
waiting for him.

18:58.937 --> 19:01.337
You need a spot?

19:02.174 --> 19:05.143
Look, when Clark shows up,
I'll be ready.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.437
But until then,
don't pretend we're friends.

19:07.613 --> 19:10.173
I just wanted you
to meet my better half.

19:17.923 --> 19:21.450
Well, you should know better
than to trust a meteor freak.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.427
What's the emergency?

19:29.868 --> 19:32.200
Everything's fine here.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.171
Is this what you're planning
on doing to Lex?

19:37.042 --> 19:40.842
There's nothing wrong with Lex. You
drugged him. That's why he's delusional.

19:41.013 --> 19:45.006
If you're here to accuse me of malpractice,
I hope you have the facts to back it up.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.119
I'm sure you could explain
Lex's dubious drug regime...

19:48.287 --> 19:52.087
...but what about the existing lawsuit
for radical electroshock therapy?

19:52.257 --> 19:55.021
What happened to Mr. Watkins
was unfortunate.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.924
But for your information,
that suit was dropped.

19:58.096 --> 20:01.122
-Because Lionel Luthor paid it off.
-I'm very busy.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.564
So if you two will excuse me.

20:04.603 --> 20:09.472
Do you think if you turn Lex into a vegetable,
Lionel Luthor's gonna let you off the hook?

20:09.875 --> 20:14.403
You have all the power here, doctor.
Please, help Lex and yourself.

20:22.654 --> 20:27.114
Newspaper, magazine, crossword puzzle?

20:28.460 --> 20:30.758
What do you think?

20:31.863 --> 20:33.421
Right.

20:33.599 --> 20:36.727
It must be a little bit difficult
to turn the pages.

20:37.102 --> 20:39.866
What do you do
when you have an itch?

20:41.573 --> 20:43.734
Get out of my face.

20:43.909 --> 20:49.040
Boy, I bet you are just itching
to get out of this place.

20:52.050 --> 20:55.110
Mr. Luthor, what would you do
if I told you...

20:55.287 --> 20:59.121
...I'd figured out a way
for certain animals to escape the zoo?

21:00.158 --> 21:04.652
-I'd ask you why you're still here.
-Funding issues.

21:04.830 --> 21:09.028
Once I'm out, I need to disappear.
And a new identity doesn't come cheap.

21:09.201 --> 21:12.500
Oh, I admired your ambition.

21:12.971 --> 21:16.498
But when you tried to murder my friends
to get my money...

21:16.975 --> 21:18.806
...you went a little too far.

21:18.977 --> 21:22.208
I know I've made some mistakes
in the past...

21:23.849 --> 21:27.945
-...but I'm all better now.
-And I'm happy for you.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.951
The both of you.

21:30.589 --> 21:34.855
Now, take your little cart, and go sucker
some other patient with a bank account.

21:35.327 --> 21:37.192
Suit yourself.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.458
Of course...

21:40.632 --> 21:43.100
...if my brain were about to be deep-fried...

21:43.268 --> 21:45.463
...I might have a little bit
different attitude.

21:45.637 --> 21:50.097
It's gonna be hard to get around
when your toes are permanently curled.

21:52.311 --> 21:56.873
Fear's an effective sales tactic,
but it doesn't work on me.

21:57.182 --> 21:59.514
How about facts?

22:02.020 --> 22:03.817
See...

22:06.224 --> 22:08.215
...you're on deck, Mr. Luthor.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.192
Where'd you get this?

22:11.363 --> 22:14.355
I know everything that goes on
in this dump.

22:22.240 --> 22:26.074
If you wanna save your cerebrum,
you know where to find me.

22:47.599 --> 22:51.501
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm just pushing through the pain.

22:55.307 --> 22:59.971
-I see you changed your therapy time.
-Yeah, I wasn't crazy about the company.

23:00.145 --> 23:04.844
Would you believe me if I told you
I was a nice guy once with no issues?

23:05.050 --> 23:08.042
Nice guys normally have the most issues.

23:08.954 --> 23:11.923
That's why I came.
I wanted to apologize.

23:12.090 --> 23:14.558
Sorry for taking it out on you.

23:18.997 --> 23:21.591
I was upset
because you're kind of right.

23:22.033 --> 23:25.002
I haven't really been pushing myself.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.900
I guess it's because I know
when I get back on my feet...

23:28.073 --> 23:30.064
...my life's gonna be different.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.040
I don't really know
if I'm ready to face it.

23:33.845 --> 23:36.746
So you never got around to telling me
why you're in here.

23:36.948 --> 23:41.783
Isn't it obvious?
Fine cuisine, post-modern decor.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.246
No, really, what happened?

23:47.993 --> 23:52.362
Well, I tried to get into a burning building,
and a beam collapsed on me.

23:54.166 --> 23:57.158
My parents were inside.
I thought I could save them.

24:01.406 --> 24:03.169
God, I'm so sorry.

24:03.642 --> 24:06.668
It happened.
Now I have to move on.

24:09.247 --> 24:10.544
See?

24:13.318 --> 24:16.185
I guess I'm a little afraid
of my future too.

24:22.060 --> 24:23.925
I convinced Foster
to stop the procedure.

24:24.095 --> 24:26.689
She's on her way now
to sign the cancellation papers.

24:26.865 --> 24:29.356
And you think this is a good thing?

24:29.668 --> 24:31.067
Clark, he knows your secret.

24:31.236 --> 24:34.569
I can't let him turn Lex
into a vegetable just for that.

24:38.944 --> 24:42.141
-You can't trust him.
-And you've never given him a chance.

24:42.347 --> 24:43.575
And you give him too many.

24:44.549 --> 24:49.851
You think it's easy keeping a lid on your
secret? I've gotta think about it all the time.

24:50.021 --> 24:54.856
I gotta say "meteor rock," not "Kryptonite,"
and I gotta cover your unexplained exits.

24:56.261 --> 24:59.822
-Pete, I'm sorry. You've never said anything.
-Clark, that's not the point.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.626
The point is that I got your back...

25:02.834 --> 25:04.995
...but Lex won't.

25:06.905 --> 25:09.738
Chloe, what's wrong?

25:09.908 --> 25:11.273
Claire Foster's dead.

25:12.844 --> 25:15.836
They found her car wrapped around
a tree off Highway 54.

25:17.382 --> 25:19.748
I feel the invisible hand
of Lionel Luthor.

25:23.622 --> 25:26.716
You two had better back off
before he sets his sights on you.

25:32.797 --> 25:36.198
I know you were just trying to help Lex,
but you've made matters worse.

25:36.368 --> 25:40.702
-There's gotta be another way to stop it.
-Dr. Foster tried and look what happened.

25:41.306 --> 25:44.104
Lionel Luthor is gonna make sure
this procedure happens.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.719
Lex.

26:00.926 --> 26:02.791
Clark, I knew you'd come.

26:03.628 --> 26:04.925
Let's get you out of here.

26:13.638 --> 26:15.606
All this time...

26:15.774 --> 26:17.401
...I was right about you.

26:26.618 --> 26:29.644
What do you know? It worked.

26:35.794 --> 26:37.455
If it weren't for you, Kent...

26:38.597 --> 26:42.465
...I'd be at Harvard right now
with a coed on each arm.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.038
What the hell are you doing to him?

26:53.979 --> 26:56.607
Your buddy's
our first-class ticket out of here.

26:58.850 --> 27:03.219
Is that how you plan to escape?
I'm not giving you a cent. Clark's my friend.

27:03.388 --> 27:08.155
You ought to pick your friends better,
since he didn't tell you his little secret.

27:10.595 --> 27:12.392
Come on, let's get out of here.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.489
No.

27:15.734 --> 27:17.361
Lex.

27:19.270 --> 27:23.206
-Leave him alone!
-Or you'll do what, Mr. Luthor?

27:23.375 --> 27:26.708
Considering they're coming to fry your ass
in about five minutes.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.139
Leave him alone!

27:46.197 --> 27:51.692
Well, here he is. Right on schedule.

27:53.772 --> 27:56.104
-Eric.
-Time to give me those powers back.

27:56.875 --> 27:59.241
It's not like you use them anyway.

27:59.778 --> 28:01.336
This will never work.

28:03.948 --> 28:06.212
Are you kidding?
There's enough voltage in here...

28:06.384 --> 28:09.581
...to power a small,
Third-World country.

28:12.924 --> 28:16.758
Save your strength, Clark.
I'm gonna need it.

28:25.470 --> 28:27.335
Clark!

28:28.640 --> 28:31.302
Clark! Clark!

28:33.144 --> 28:34.668
They've got Clark!

28:34.846 --> 28:38.338
-How the hell did he get out?
-I don't know, but I ain't taking any chances.

28:38.516 --> 28:40.916
No! No!

28:51.262 --> 28:55.289
-There you go. Almost.
-Okay.

28:56.534 --> 28:58.229
Done.

28:58.403 --> 29:01.668
It's not Mount Everest, but it is a start.

29:01.906 --> 29:04.431
A few days ago,
I wouldn't have thought that possible.

29:04.609 --> 29:08.807
Sometimes you just have to look
impossibility straight in the eye.

29:13.151 --> 29:16.086
Mrs. Kent, what a surprise.

29:16.254 --> 29:19.712
Chloe had a late deadline. She asked
if I could give you a ride home.

29:20.458 --> 29:21.755
-I'm gonna go.
-Okay.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.791
-Hello.
-Hello.

29:25.497 --> 29:27.488
Interesting physical therapist.

29:31.770 --> 29:35.866
So how's Clark?
I got his card.

29:36.741 --> 29:43.169
-I'm sorry he hasn't come by to see you.
-To be honest, that was kind of my idea.

29:49.788 --> 29:53.622
Lana, I know that Clark's not always
the easiest person to understand...

29:54.025 --> 29:56.425
...but he never meant
to put you in danger.

29:59.097 --> 30:01.190
Did he send you to argue his case?

30:02.200 --> 30:06.296
He doesn't know I'm here.
I'm sure he'd be upset that I was meddling.

30:06.504 --> 30:08.768
I just want him to be happy.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.472
I know.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.612
But you need to be happy too, Lana.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.310
Thanks, Mrs. Kent.

30:31.930 --> 30:35.866
Please. I'll pay you
whatever you want.

30:36.267 --> 30:39.498
You'll never have to work
another day in your life.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.435
He doesn't want your money, son.

30:47.812 --> 30:49.643
He wants to make you better.

30:50.315 --> 30:51.509
Just like I do.

30:52.750 --> 30:55.617
-You're a liar.
-No. Be strong, Lex.

30:55.787 --> 30:58.085
-Liar!
-I'm sorry, son.

30:58.256 --> 31:00.952
-No, don't do this, Dad. Don't do--
-Be strong. Be strong.

31:01.125 --> 31:07.189
Be strong. Be strong. I'm sorry, son.
I didn't think it would have to come to this.

31:08.967 --> 31:12.664
If it were a gangrenous limb,
we could amputate.

31:12.837 --> 31:18.104
The brain, unfortunately,
is infinitely more complex.

31:18.309 --> 31:19.503
No, don't do this!

31:20.879 --> 31:23.109
-Do it.
-No!

31:28.253 --> 31:31.711
Hey! Come on, let's go!

31:32.156 --> 31:34.021
I'm right here.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.218
What happened to your better half?

31:36.394 --> 31:39.056
It's a lot easier to break one person out
than two.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.027
Let's go.

31:59.918 --> 32:03.513
-What is it? What's happening?
-We don't have any power.

32:03.688 --> 32:06.418
-There must be a short somewhere.
-Well, fix it.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.241
Do you feel any different?

32:34.852 --> 32:36.911
Does that answer your question?

32:49.100 --> 32:52.866
Welcome back to being normal, Clark.
Kind of sucks, doesn't it?

33:00.111 --> 33:03.046
All right, you'll pay for the two
wasted years I spent in here.

33:03.214 --> 33:06.240
-Eric, let's go.
-I'm not through with him yet.

33:06.417 --> 33:09.250
They're gonna realize we're gone.
They'll be here any minute.

33:09.420 --> 33:12.287
-What do I care? It's not my problem.
-No, no, wait a second.

33:12.557 --> 33:17.585
-We're a team. I thought we were friends.
-There's no such thing as friends in here.

33:22.266 --> 33:23.756
Hey!

33:26.104 --> 33:28.129
Is that all you got?

33:28.740 --> 33:32.141
That little jolt make you insane, Clark?

33:37.849 --> 33:39.908
Look who's afraid to use
their powers now.

34:10.313 --> 34:12.509
I don't know what happened.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.706
Again.

34:14.886 --> 34:18.514
But, sir, the way this equipment is working,
we should wait.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.190
Do it.

34:21.359 --> 34:23.554
Again.

34:38.576 --> 34:40.237
Tell me where Lex is.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.379
Now.

35:13.044 --> 35:14.875
Lex.

35:15.980 --> 35:17.675
Son?

35:22.420 --> 35:23.887
It's over.

35:38.002 --> 35:40.402
-Hi.
-Hey.

35:40.671 --> 35:42.798
Am I hallucinating? No crutches.

35:42.974 --> 35:47.343
It's amazing what you can accomplish when
someone's cracking a whip over your head.

35:50.281 --> 35:52.943
-You okay?
-Yeah.

35:53.117 --> 35:58.020
This? Don't let it spook you.
I tend to get dehydrated from time to time.

35:59.457 --> 36:04.121
Well, I know that these probably can't
compare to the desserts in here...

36:04.295 --> 36:09.460
...but I wanted to thank you
for being such a pain in the butt.

36:09.901 --> 36:11.801
Anytime.

36:13.204 --> 36:16.799
So I guess this is goodbye.

36:17.475 --> 36:21.434
Just because I finished physical therapy
doesn't mean I won't come by and visit.

36:21.712 --> 36:23.873
Lana, please.

36:24.148 --> 36:28.551
I'm a memory from a painful moment in your
life. Who wants to be reminded of that?

36:29.120 --> 36:31.054
We all push through the pain, Adam.

36:33.257 --> 36:35.418
Maybe you're not willing to do that.

36:37.361 --> 36:40.888
Lana, I'll be completely honest with you.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.159
I like you.

36:43.434 --> 36:46.335
But I get the feeling that
there's someone else...

36:47.071 --> 36:50.063
...and I don't wanna be caught
in the middle of anything.

36:50.508 --> 36:54.205
There is nothing
to be caught in the middle of.

36:54.745 --> 36:56.337
But...

36:58.149 --> 37:01.607
...I'm not really ready to be jumping
into another relationship right away.

37:01.786 --> 37:04.380
Trust me, I don't wanna be
your rebound boy either...

37:05.790 --> 37:08.020
...but I would like to be your friend.

37:08.826 --> 37:10.794
Oh, I'd like that.

37:12.396 --> 37:13.954
Good.

37:14.632 --> 37:16.691
Then we're friends?

37:18.336 --> 37:19.701
Friends.

37:32.183 --> 37:33.844
Lex.

37:36.654 --> 37:39.282
-Clark.
-How you feeling?

37:39.757 --> 37:41.725
Great, actually.

37:42.994 --> 37:45.087
Never better.

37:48.332 --> 37:53.565
I heard you came to visit me,
and I wasn't a very cordial host.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.640
If that's true, I'm sorry.

37:59.777 --> 38:02.371
Did your dad tell you
why he had you committed?

38:03.914 --> 38:06.610
He said I had a psychotic break.

38:06.884 --> 38:12.754
They think my island trauma precipitated it.
I'm grateful my father recognized it in time.

38:14.525 --> 38:16.152
Me too.

38:18.996 --> 38:21.829
Do you wanna tell me something, Clark?

38:24.135 --> 38:25.762
No.

38:26.103 --> 38:28.469
It's good to have you back, Lex.

38:28.839 --> 38:30.830
Welcome home.

38:32.476 --> 38:35.934
You know, Clark,
there is one thing I'll never forget.

38:39.850 --> 38:41.477
What's that?

38:49.293 --> 38:52.285
How important your friendship is to me.

39:09.146 --> 39:11.637
I'm sorry, Clark.

39:12.717 --> 39:14.810
Lex is okay.

39:15.252 --> 39:17.311
Your secret's safe.

39:17.655 --> 39:20.715
You gotta find some consolation in that.

39:20.958 --> 39:23.222
Lex is right.

39:23.394 --> 39:25.760
Lionel got away with murder.

39:25.930 --> 39:29.127
But you didn't tell him
what really happened.

39:30.234 --> 39:32.600
Well, I figured, what's the point?

39:36.340 --> 39:38.501
Clark.

39:39.810 --> 39:43.075
Clark, I do not want you and Chloe
taking up this charge.

39:45.282 --> 39:47.682
Someone's gonna make Lionel
pay for his crime.

39:48.285 --> 39:50.753
Someday somebody will make
Lionel pay for his crime...

39:50.921 --> 39:52.650
...but that day is not today, Clark.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.819
I know this is very difficult...

39:57.995 --> 40:01.931
...but you have to realize there are people
who are more powerful than you are.

40:06.804 --> 40:08.135
Yeah.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.756
You okay?

40:30.294 --> 40:32.785
In a way, I envy Lex.

40:34.231 --> 40:36.597
He seemed so happy.

40:40.137 --> 40:43.971
I wish I could erase
the last few months of my life.

40:49.680 --> 40:54.208
I heard they're having a welcome-back party
for Lana at the Talon.

40:54.852 --> 40:56.911
Why don't you go.

40:58.856 --> 41:01.120
You never quit, do you?

41:01.992 --> 41:04.392
It's called tough love.

41:04.662 --> 41:07.130
Come on. Go.

41:08.399 --> 41:10.526
I know your secret.

41:14.872 --> 41:17.033
I know your secret.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.735
I haven 't said a word to anyone.

41:22.580 --> 41:25.105
I know your secret.

41:26.617 --> 41:28.744
I haven 't said a word to anyone.

41:30.588 --> 41:33.022
Why didn't you show me this sooner?

41:33.190 --> 41:36.216
-lt took all week to enhance the audio, sir.
-A week?

41:36.393 --> 41:39.055
And this is the best you can do?

41:41.632 --> 41:42.894
I know your secret.

41:45.135 --> 41:47.262
I know your secret.

41:48.572 --> 41:50.631
I know your secret.

41:53.000 --> 41:58.000
