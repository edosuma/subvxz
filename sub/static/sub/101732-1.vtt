14:59.364 --> 15:05.671
Yes, you can.
Come on, yes.

15:17.749 --> 15:23.088
The school needs to encourage

15:25.290 --> 15:27.393
The right solution will come.

15:28.826 --> 15:29.994
What is all this, huh?

15:30.861 --> 15:34.232
Are we supposed to continue

15:52.517 --> 15:58.590

I never gave you anything. Okay?

15:58.623 --> 16:00.358

16:05.162 --> 16:06.597
Yes.

16:06.630 --> 16:08.098
I'm sorry to say, Sir,

16:08.133 --> 16:10.869
that there is no one in the authority
here that supports his wellbeing.

16:19.710 --> 16:23.514
- Sir. Sir. Den is bleeding.
- What?

16:23.547 --> 16:24.682
Oh, my God!

16:26.850 --> 16:28.652
Oh, no!

16:28.686 --> 16:31.824
Oh, my God!

16:33.157 --> 16:37.162
There is an institute
for cerebral palsy in Kolkata.

16:37.195 --> 16:41.532
They have the staff to handle the
disability at the same time teach.

16:43.868 --> 16:48.739
Avik, it's Kolkata
and... and Den is only eleven.

16:49.440 --> 16:55.914
What I'm asking is that we look at all options,
but there maybe something we haven't tried.

17:03.321 --> 17:05.290
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello.

17:08.858 --> 17:10.194
Please.

17:11.529 --> 17:15.934
- Hello, Den. Den, hi.
- Say hello.

17:19.368 --> 17:24.943
See, I have contacted Dr. Claudia,
she was a colleague of mine.

17:24.974 --> 17:30.616
And I have sent all his medical history
and she is ready to do the treatment.

17:32.282 --> 17:35.520
Den will go through a series
of treatment with Dr. Claudia

17:35.552 --> 17:37.922
- almost for 6 to 12 months.
- Oh.

17:37.955 --> 17:41.525
And she is also doing research
in alternative therapies.

17:46.763 --> 17:48.199
Hmm.

18:19.930 --> 18:22.633
These lessons cover
everything he will miss.

18:22.667 --> 18:25.837

before next school year.

24:55.359 --> 24:58.061
Let me tell you a story.

24:58.094 --> 25:01.264
It was a beautiful day
like this, hmm.

25:01.298 --> 25:03.968
Suddenly a tremendous storm
kicked up,

25:04.001 --> 25:07.705
and all the animals started
running here and there,

25:07.737 --> 25:10.207
except the baby rhino

25:10.241 --> 25:14.412
that was waiting for her mother
under their favorite banyan tree.

25:14.445 --> 25:16.013
Den.

25:17.013 --> 25:20.217
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay, Den.

25:21.819 --> 25:26.124
A young elephant
got separated from its herd,

25:26.157 --> 25:30.829
it took cover
under the same banyan tree.

25:32.263 --> 25:35.233
The baby rhino got frightened,

25:36.000 --> 25:41.739
and then the young elephant
brings the branch down

25:41.772 --> 25:44.908
and put it over his head

25:44.942 --> 25:48.847
to give shelter
to the baby rhino.

25:50.046 --> 25:52.816
And thunder broke down

25:54.084 --> 25:56.888
and the tree
was hit by lightning,

25:56.920 --> 25:59.389
it then burst into flames.

25:59.423 --> 26:04.796
Then the elephant pushed the
baby rhino away from the fire.

26:05.929 --> 26:09.266
The mother rhino
then heard their cries,

26:09.300 --> 26:13.238
and she ran over there
to save them. Hmm?

26:14.003 --> 26:20.144
Now it has been said that the
rhino is the last of its kind,

26:20.176 --> 26:24.182
saved from the poachers
by the elephant's herd. Hmm?

26:25.983 --> 26:28.386
Now my point is that,

26:28.418 --> 26:33.323
sometimes the best way to fit in
with others

26:33.357 --> 26:36.994
is to be brave and stand out.

26:41.965 --> 26:44.269
Okay. Let's go.

26:55.812 --> 26:59.350
Okay, I will be right back.
Okay?

27:27.844 --> 27:29.480
What happened?

27:31.282 --> 27:33.216
Hey, na, na.

27:59.275 --> 28:03.547
<i>that they can move beyond the
stigma of somehow being inferior.</i>

28:59.503 --> 29:04.042
Wait. Let him be brave.

29:11.682 --> 29:14.385
That's one way to stand out,
hmm?

29:37.041 --> 29:39.510
Hey guys, great session.
Take a 5 minute, all right?

29:39.542 --> 29:42.446
That was the best. That was
like a pure dopamine rush.

29:42.478 --> 29:45.649
I mean this gives me an entirely
new angle on my music therapy.

29:45.683 --> 29:51.989
You know this is proof positive that music
sets the brain firing on all synapses.

29:52.022 --> 29:53.557
- It's amazing.
- Just stop, okay.

29:53.590 --> 29:55.260
You sound like
a doped-up groupie.

29:55.725 --> 29:57.293
Oh, yeah?

29:57.328 --> 30:01.499
I bet you can teach me about instruments
working together in harmony, maestro.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.469
Seriously, I want you to teach me
about different frequencies and notes.

30:05.502 --> 30:08.272
I mean, they must have taught
you some emotional resonance.

30:08.304 --> 30:09.474
It was Juilliard, right?

30:10.139 --> 30:11.507
All right, you know what?

30:11.542 --> 30:14.544
Stop grasping for straws in some
twisted attempt to understand me.

30:15.378 --> 30:18.315
You are wasting
precious years on a guess.

30:18.349 --> 30:21.152
Your thesis, you're gonna be
a laughing stock.

30:21.185 --> 30:25.322
Oh, my God! You're rehearsing a presentation
that you have no concrete research on.

30:26.122 --> 30:27.357
Grow up.

30:35.465 --> 30:37.734
He is suffering from severe depression.
It will pass with time.

30:37.767 --> 30:39.970
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello, Sir.

30:40.003 --> 30:41.371
Yes.

30:41.405 --> 30:43.407
It should pass with time.

30:43.439 --> 30:46.643
I see no reason not to
continue with the therapies.

30:47.778 --> 30:51.082
Hopefully, his speech will return
as quickly as it disappeared.

30:51.115 --> 30:54.352
But, Doctor, the school here will
do nothing to improve his mood.

30:54.385 --> 30:56.520
Then it may be
time to call Kolkata.

30:56.552 --> 30:57.655
Hmm.

31:10.567 --> 31:13.436
Oh, my God! She's on fire.

31:13.469 --> 31:15.038
Yes, I know.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.176
Doctor.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.984
- Give her some paracetamols. Okay.
- Yes, Doctor.

31:31.588 --> 31:35.192
Take proper care
and take rest at home.

31:35.225 --> 31:37.462
- She will be all right.
- Thank you, Doctor.

32:03.153 --> 32:04.722
- He is Dr. Bhatt.
- Okay.

32:04.754 --> 32:06.157
And she is Dr. Sen.

32:06.189 --> 32:10.027
- She is from Kolkata and she is the director of Hope Institute.
- Hello.

32:14.398 --> 32:18.403
Test scores, exemplary.

32:22.505 --> 32:27.144
Hmm, essays and penmanship,
remarkable.

32:28.512 --> 32:33.150
Oh, drawing of Anil,
the likeness is stunning.

32:33.783 --> 32:35.085
Poor Anil.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.253
- Let's see her performance.
- Sure.

32:37.286 --> 32:42.725
She has problems in mobility but
she is improving with physiotherapy.

32:42.759 --> 32:44.428
Wonderful.

32:48.831 --> 32:50.767
She has problem with hearing,

32:50.801 --> 32:55.172
but with the vibrations of sound
she could play the notes.

32:55.205 --> 32:57.774
I would love to meet her
before I return to Kolkata.

33:04.348 --> 33:05.883
Don't worry.
I'll take care of her.

33:05.916 --> 33:08.252
- She will be all right. Okay.
- Okay, madam.

33:08.284 --> 33:09.753
Not to worry.

33:09.785 --> 33:12.856
I had to cut through
the field to get here in time.

33:21.665 --> 33:23.501
Save your hands.

33:27.170 --> 33:30.273
I know.
I know what you say.

33:30.307 --> 33:32.309
Save your hands.

33:48.958 --> 33:52.562
Harmony will be always with you,
hmm?

33:59.436 --> 34:03.307
Be careful, take care.

34:05.341 --> 34:06.610
Come.

34:08.911 --> 34:11.313
Come, come.

34:15.252 --> 34:19.257
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.
She will be all right.

34:20.324 --> 34:21.592
Okay.

34:24.728 --> 34:27.831
- Bye, Angel.
- Bye.

34:29.366 --> 34:31.601
One, two, three.

34:31.634 --> 34:33.536
One, two, three.

34:34.337 --> 34:36.773
One, two, three.
You do it.

34:36.806 --> 34:38.975
One, two, three.

34:39.009 --> 34:41.179
Good job, Leo.

34:41.777 --> 34:43.746
Maybe it is a waste of time,
huh?

34:44.815 --> 34:48.918
- Uh, I mean my thesis.
- Oh, okay. That's different.

34:48.951 --> 34:51.721
One, two, three.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.958
One, two, three.

34:53.991 --> 34:56.659
- Very good. Good job.
- Good job, Leo.

34:56.692 --> 35:00.697
We're all done for today, okay?
Here, let me just take this off.

35:01.397 --> 35:02.999
Thanks.

35:03.032 --> 35:05.235
Well, Max does
know music if anything.

35:05.268 --> 35:06.636
If anything.

35:06.670 --> 35:08.906
- Easy, he's still my boyfriend.
- Mm-hmm.

35:08.938 --> 35:11.708
Anyhow, if the same habitual
response were to be combined

35:11.741 --> 35:14.244
with say strumming
or beating a bongo,

35:14.277 --> 35:17.313
I just think that you would have
an easier time with your patients.

35:17.346 --> 35:20.650
And that's exactly why your
time isn't wasted here, Raina.

35:20.683 --> 35:23.286
I know,
you are right, of course.

35:23.319 --> 35:24.955
It's just that Neurocon
is in a few weeks,

35:24.987 --> 35:26.790
and even if I used
your facility,

35:26.822 --> 35:29.659
I mean where am I going to get
the patients to study?

35:29.692 --> 35:32.996
Hmm. Good point.
Thank you.

35:33.663 --> 35:36.933
Raina, let me show you
something, very quickly here.

35:39.002 --> 35:40.337
Hmm?

35:40.904 --> 35:44.041
Ah, this is Den.
He is from India.

35:44.074 --> 35:47.578
- He was a patient of mine a long, long time ago.
- Wow.

35:47.610 --> 35:51.648
Look, he is dancing.
He is loving this music. He is so happy.

35:51.681 --> 35:56.587
You know there are tons of advocates
for alternate therapies outside the U.S.

35:56.619 --> 36:00.657
In fact, I know someone,
Dr. Sen.

36:00.690 --> 36:05.995
She and I were college roommates and now she is
the director of the Hope Institute in Kolkata.

36:06.029 --> 36:09.800
- Kolkata.
- Kolkata. - Mm-hmm.

36:09.833 --> 36:13.470
As prophetic as that sounds,
there's no time for me to go to India.

36:13.502 --> 36:17.073
Raina, you can always
reschedule your review cycle.

36:17.107 --> 36:19.643
Research worth
doing is worth doing right.

36:20.377 --> 36:23.413
Okay, India.
Max would freak.

36:23.447 --> 36:24.348
Yeah.

36:30.619 --> 36:31.955
Max, dinner's here.

36:31.987 --> 36:34.324
Were you going to get it?
Well, I suppose I'm buying, too.

36:34.357 --> 36:35.926
Money is on the table.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.835
Really? Indian food?

36:46.737 --> 36:47.738
We need to talk.

36:50.473 --> 36:51.542
I'm getting pizza.

37:08.558 --> 37:11.895
I signed...

37:11.927 --> 37:17.699
signed up for music therapy.

37:17.701 --> 37:23.741
- And you should come, too.
- Hmm.

37:23.773 --> 37:25.109
Please.

37:25.141 --> 37:30.413
Very funny, what next you want
me to sign up for <i>American Idol?</i>

37:30.447 --> 37:36.020
<i>American Idol,</i> very funny.

37:36.953 --> 37:42.726
Doctor is coming from...

37:44.860 --> 37:47.130
America,

37:47.163 --> 37:51.567
for special research.

37:56.873 --> 38:00.476
Here's the address.
The Hope Institute.

38:00.509 --> 38:05.515
- First time here, Madam?
- Yes. It's beautiful.

38:05.549 --> 38:07.717
That was just the airport.

38:08.717 --> 38:13.790
Victoria Memorial, Park Street,
<i>Maidan,</i>

38:19.628 --> 38:21.464
Beautiful colors.

38:21.498 --> 38:23.801
If you are tired of buildings,
Madam,

38:23.833 --> 38:28.906
nightclubs, shopping,
new market, AC Market.

38:29.605 --> 38:31.007
Sounds good.

38:58.802 --> 39:00.504
Thank you.

39:04.808 --> 39:07.878
- Good luck, Madam.
- Thanks.

39:09.980 --> 39:14.083
- Dr. Sen, Raina Wilson.
- Huh, please come.

39:15.051 --> 39:17.487
- Glad to meet you.
- You, too.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.856
- Well, I will show you around.
- Yeah.

39:22.292 --> 39:25.728
It's so wonderful to see a facility
of this size focused on disabilities.

39:25.761 --> 39:30.533
We consider the Hope Institute a
place of possibility not disability.

39:30.567 --> 39:32.770
That's my challenge also.

39:35.672 --> 39:38.175
- I'll show your apartment, come.
- Okay. - Come.

39:40.911 --> 39:43.581
Hopefully you'll find
it before too long.

39:46.049 --> 39:49.920
Well, we have several
students signed up for you.

39:50.853 --> 39:53.823
- Thanks.
- Get some rest, I will see you later.

39:53.857 --> 39:55.092
Okay. Thanks.

40:10.639 --> 40:14.911
Tanya, severe cerebral palsy.
Adite, Down syndrome.

40:14.944 --> 40:20.551
Niladri, acute leukemia, severe
migraines, paralysis of the spine.

40:21.150 --> 40:25.721
Jeeja, Misty, Palek, Brent,
Miguel, Tanya, Adite, Niladri.

40:25.755 --> 40:28.225
Jeeja, Misty, Palek, Brent.

40:31.795 --> 40:35.197
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good Morning.

40:35.230 --> 40:38.301
- My name is Raina.
- Hi. - Hi.

40:38.902 --> 40:41.338
I am your new
teacher from America.

40:41.371 --> 40:43.206
Can everyone say the name Raina?

40:43.239 --> 40:45.074
Raina.

40:45.107 --> 40:47.343
Very good, what is your name?

40:47.377 --> 40:49.980
- Shruti.
- Shruti, that's a beautiful name.

40:50.614 --> 40:52.148
- What is your name?
- Jeeja.

40:52.181 --> 40:54.250
Jeeja. Lovely name.

40:56.085 --> 40:59.089
- Now you guys are all lucky, you know why?
- Why?

40:59.121 --> 41:04.728
Because, all of you only have
to learn one name, Raina,

41:04.761 --> 41:08.264
but I have to learn all of your
names to get to know you, right?

41:08.297 --> 41:10.333
Well, how am I going to do that?

41:11.134 --> 41:14.304
Well, they say you can learn
a lot about someone

41:14.337 --> 41:16.974
by what kind of music they like.

41:17.007 --> 41:20.844
So, I'm going to play some
songs, some different songs,

41:20.877 --> 41:23.147
and see
what you guys respond to.

41:25.681 --> 41:29.285
- Come in.
- She can't hear you.

41:36.692 --> 41:37.860
Come.

41:55.944 --> 41:58.881
- No fighting, no fighting, are you okay?
- Hmm.

41:58.915 --> 42:00.683
- Okay?
- Hmm.

42:00.717 --> 42:02.185
You want to sit down?

42:05.922 --> 42:08.759
Thank you.
You are my new best friend.

42:09.259 --> 42:11.661
Come, come to the class.

42:12.429 --> 42:14.197
Yes, join, join.

42:14.230 --> 42:18.701
It was horrible and all I kept thinking was Max
told me not to use nursery rhymes as music.

42:18.735 --> 42:22.006
Yeah, sounds like you could have
destroyed some eardrums, Raina.

42:23.373 --> 42:25.376
Why don't you come back before
someone actually gets hurt?

42:26.042 --> 42:29.279
Huh, it took me a day to get here.
I couldn't even turnaround if I wanted to.

42:31.047 --> 42:32.215
Well, make it quick.

42:33.215 --> 42:35.685
I had to wash my gig clothes
and I ruined my favorite vest.

42:36.152 --> 42:38.355
Babe, I told you that
needed to be dry-cleaned.

42:38.388 --> 42:42.292
Well, I didn't know that.
I don't do my own laundry, Raina.

42:42.324 --> 42:44.360
So you owe me big.

42:45.261 --> 42:46.697
I do?

42:48.165 --> 42:50.967
Listen, Max, I gotta get to sleep
okay, so I... I'll call you soon?

42:52.802 --> 42:54.071
No, Raina.

42:54.404 --> 42:58.007
Hello?
Unbelievable.

43:11.286 --> 43:13.022
- Hey, Claud.
- <i>Hi, Raina.</i>

43:13.056 --> 43:18.195
Listen, so I just wanted to let
you know, day one, disastrous.

43:18.228 --> 43:20.831
Hang on. I'm just going to
get some tea, one sec.

43:22.799 --> 43:26.103
<i>Wow!</i>

43:26.136 --> 43:28.237
Yeah, may be give
me someone else to talk to.

43:28.270 --> 43:29.973
<i>Hey, don't
forget to look up Den.</i>

43:30.005 --> 43:31.273
<i>I'm sure he'd love to help.</i>

43:31.306 --> 43:34.110
Oh, Claud, I'm so sorry.
I totally forgot.

43:34.143 --> 43:36.078
- I'll look up Den tomorrow, okay?
- <i>Okay.</i>

43:36.112 --> 43:37.748
Bye, Claud.

43:42.786 --> 43:44.088
This is Den.

43:45.455 --> 43:48.991
Den, she is Raina Wilson
from America.

43:49.025 --> 43:53.230
She is researching on
music therapy at Hope Institute.

43:53.263 --> 43:56.098
Nice to meet you.
I'm a colleague of Dr. Claudia.

43:56.132 --> 43:57.868
Oh.

43:57.900 --> 44:00.103
- Den is an avid music fan.
- Yes.

44:00.136 --> 44:02.239
So I've heard.
Maybe you can help me out.

44:02.272 --> 44:03.206
Sure.

44:06.009 --> 44:09.846
<i>In his hospitality,
Den showed me that in India,</i>

44:09.878 --> 44:13.350
<i>there is a musicality
and rhythm, in everyday life.</i>

44:16.985 --> 44:18.821
This is my therapy.

44:18.855 --> 44:23.025
Nature has music
for those that listen.

44:23.826 --> 44:26.962
- I think you are the second best friend I've made in India.
- Okay.

44:26.996 --> 44:30.868
The first better be amazing or I'll be offended.

45:08.871 --> 45:09.973
My first best friend.

45:10.005 --> 45:12.174
Yeah, I'm not offended.

45:14.344 --> 45:16.279
Okay, now that everyone's here,

45:16.311 --> 45:21.150
my friend Den here believes that
you can find music in nature.

45:21.183 --> 45:24.388
So let's see what kind of
sounds nature can make, okay?

45:31.094 --> 45:32.362
Yay!

45:32.395 --> 45:35.931
Let's hear the sound
of the rain. Ready?

45:42.505 --> 45:45.475
Now, lighter rain.

46:40.964 --> 46:44.534
Stop, stop, stop. Okay. No.

46:47.270 --> 46:48.672
Oh, no!

46:52.208 --> 46:54.244
Guys, guys, guys.

46:55.078 --> 47:00.016
Sit down. Sit down. Come on, come on.
Sit down. Sit down.

47:00.049 --> 47:03.052
Sit, sit, sit.
Relax, relax.

47:03.085 --> 47:06.022
- Come, come.
- Oh, God!

47:06.054 --> 47:10.159
- You need more best friends now?
- Yeah, I think so.

47:10.192 --> 47:12.027
<i>Raina, listen to me.</i>

47:12.060 --> 47:14.296
<i>I insist that you come home
as scheduled.</i>

47:14.330 --> 47:16.333
<i>This is my life uprooted, too.</i>

47:18.000 --> 47:20.203
Oh, yes.

47:20.235 --> 47:22.605
What? What?
Is someone there with you?

47:23.306 --> 47:26.042
What? No.

47:26.074 --> 47:27.377
You know you're the one who told
me that if...

47:27.409 --> 47:30.346
I would fail without any
concrete research, right?

47:31.080 --> 47:34.049
You think I'm here having an affair
with an Indian guy in a wheelchair?

47:34.083 --> 47:37.721
<i>I don't know Raina,
put me on a video chat.</i>

47:38.688 --> 47:41.992
Look, I'm going to calling you
when I know my schedule, okay?

47:42.025 --> 47:43.193
Love you.

47:50.366 --> 47:54.471
<i>♪ Twinkle, twinkle Little star ♪</i>

47:54.503 --> 47:59.241
<i>♪ How I wonder what you are ♪</i>

47:59.275 --> 48:03.713
<i>♪ Up above the world so high ♪</i>

48:03.746 --> 48:07.517
<i>♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪</i>

48:25.368 --> 48:29.072
<i>The happy boy Niladri
made friends easily.</i>

48:29.105 --> 48:30.340
<i>He loved to write poems.</i>

48:31.440 --> 48:33.743
I couldn't speak always,
you know.

48:33.775 --> 48:35.344
When I was a kid,

48:35.811 --> 48:40.150
my parents sent me to a doctor,

48:40.850 --> 48:44.121
friend of Raina's in America.

48:45.621 --> 48:49.325
Priya was the first girl
in my life

48:49.357 --> 48:53.462
who never thought
I am different.

48:59.201 --> 49:03.305
Being with you
has changed my life.

49:03.706 --> 49:06.476
Thanks for being my girlfriend.

49:08.610 --> 49:12.815
We? We could never be
boyfriend and girlfriend. Huh.

49:31.833 --> 49:36.739
Den, Den. What happened?
Den, Den, Den.

49:52.788 --> 49:56.359
Hi.
Oh, that sounds wonderful.

49:57.426 --> 49:59.761
I thought I was
in a festival for a minute.

50:04.433 --> 50:06.436
Why not have them put on a show?

50:07.235 --> 50:09.873
Mm-hmm, give them a goal.

50:09.906 --> 50:12.775
Uh, I've already bit off
more than I can chew.

50:13.409 --> 50:16.579
Um, I can help.

50:16.612 --> 50:18.181
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

50:19.214 --> 50:20.549
Hmm, okay.

50:20.583 --> 50:23.453
I have another staff member
helping me organize a small concert

50:23.485 --> 50:25.420
to keep the students
interested in music,

50:25.453 --> 50:28.690
I just can't pinpoint that
measurable goal to reach.

50:28.723 --> 50:30.559
Hey, how's Den?

50:31.493 --> 50:32.594
He's good.

50:32.628 --> 50:36.665
I mean there was some drama,
but he's been a big help.

50:37.299 --> 50:43.205
Remember, it's not always the physicality
of the condition that's most debilitating.

50:43.239 --> 50:46.909
It's the mental condition
that is wrongly imposed.

50:46.942 --> 50:50.946
"It's the mental condition
that is wrongly imposed", right?

50:50.980 --> 50:53.349
Have you done
any sightseeing or anything?

50:53.382 --> 50:56.186
No. I can't... I don't...
I don't have time.

50:56.219 --> 50:58.421
Don't tell me
you don't have the time.

50:58.453 --> 51:01.891
You'll never gauge your progress if you
don't get out for a fresh perspective.

51:02.558 --> 51:05.494
<i>As your mentor, I insist.</i>

51:05.527 --> 51:08.497
- Okay. Okay. Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

51:10.632 --> 51:12.435
- <i>"Thoughts...</i>
- Jeeja.

51:12.467 --> 51:14.803
<i>...the childhood days
of sheer bliss..."</i>

51:18.440 --> 51:19.743
What's wrong?

51:20.442 --> 51:23.446
- Niladri.
- Sorry.

51:26.815 --> 51:30.619
You know when I first met him,
he told me he felt very lucky

51:30.652 --> 51:32.621
because besides his mother,

51:32.654 --> 51:35.557
his two best friends were the
most beautiful girls in the world.

51:35.590 --> 51:37.092
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

51:37.125 --> 51:40.362
- <i>Will I be able to pursue my dreams, my studies?</i>
- Yeah.

51:40.395 --> 51:43.565
<i>The significant
others both young and old,</i>

51:43.598 --> 51:49.471
<i>they cheer me up and cheering,
"Yes, you can. Of course, you can."</i>

51:49.505 --> 51:51.208
He is right about his luck.

51:51.873 --> 51:54.877
You two are his angels on Earth.
You know that.

51:55.578 --> 51:57.679
And now
he gets to be your angel.

51:57.712 --> 51:59.381
That's what friends are for,
right?

51:59.781 --> 52:01.083
Good way to think of it.

52:01.116 --> 52:04.319
<i>As I look into the
vastness of the evening sky</i>

52:04.353 --> 52:06.856
<i>and watch the birds
returning to their nests,</i>

52:06.889 --> 52:10.693
<i>I am once more lost
in the realm of my thoughts.</i>

52:10.726 --> 52:12.028
You know what?

52:12.060 --> 52:13.362
We could really use a diversion,

52:13.395 --> 52:16.531
so how about
you be my travel partners?

52:16.565 --> 52:19.569
<i>Niladri will always be
remembered for his creations.</i>

52:19.601 --> 52:22.638
<i>His disability was brought on
by acute Leukemia.</i>

52:24.806 --> 52:26.575
Surprise.

52:28.476 --> 52:33.750
<i>And for those who cannot articulate
their emotional or physical pain, as a society,</i>

52:33.782 --> 52:36.819
<i>we need to bring other forms of
communication into their lives.</i>

52:36.851 --> 52:38.620
Open. Turn it on. Right.

52:38.654 --> 52:44.027
<i>Oddly enough, text messaging is a big step
towards realizing that we are all connected.</i>

52:45.895 --> 52:49.632
<i>This realization offered me
the opportunity to help Angel</i>

52:49.665 --> 52:52.835
<i>who by being hearing impaired
was my greatest challenge.</i>

52:58.741 --> 53:03.380
- Thank you.
- Welcome, my pleasure, my pleasure.

53:04.880 --> 53:08.685
Okay. Go slow. Go slow.

53:08.717 --> 53:09.752
Oh, oh.

53:11.619 --> 53:13.389
- Wait, wait.
- Okay.

53:28.503 --> 53:31.473
Surely, we will stop by
the temple on our way back.

53:31.507 --> 53:33.376
Absolutely.

53:38.413 --> 53:40.449
It could be hard going home,
you know.

53:40.482 --> 53:42.618
Especially after
you've been gone a long while.

53:42.650 --> 53:44.321
I feel like it's been months
since I left America.

53:45.154 --> 53:47.489
Why did you come
all the way to India?

53:47.522 --> 53:50.459
Simple. I needed
a supportive environment

53:50.493 --> 53:52.895
to, uh, research what I believe
is an important tool

53:52.927 --> 53:54.897
to the functioning
of the human brain.

53:56.031 --> 54:00.636
Raina, wouldn't it be easier

54:00.668 --> 54:05.007
to research normal brains?

54:05.040 --> 54:07.110
Why not research normal brains?

54:07.743 --> 54:10.612
Well, that's the whole point,
what makes a brain normal, right?

54:10.645 --> 54:13.014
What you feel
or what's popular opinion?

54:13.047 --> 54:16.518
People here are more receptive to
not worrying about popular opinion.

54:17.520 --> 54:19.722
Ego's everywhere, huh.

54:19.755 --> 54:24.060
The way I see it when people
think that you're a freak

54:24.092 --> 54:26.596
and you've got nothing to lose,

54:26.628 --> 54:29.031
you can't fall off the floor,
right?

54:29.063 --> 54:32.835
You can't fall off the floor?
Okay. Right.

54:39.074 --> 54:44.813
Raina, what made you
want to be a brain doctor?

54:44.846 --> 54:47.516
- What made me want to be a brain doctor?
- Yeah.

54:47.549 --> 54:49.584
Hmm. Curiosity.

54:49.618 --> 54:51.788
When I found out that this...
this little spongy thing up there

54:51.821 --> 54:54.556
that weighs less than a pound
was responsible for everything,

54:54.589 --> 54:56.758
I guess
I just wanted to know how.

55:07.569 --> 55:13.875
Aren't you curious
about other body parts,

55:13.909 --> 55:17.079
- like the heart?
- The heart? - Yes.

55:17.112 --> 55:18.714
Sure I'm interested
in the heart,

55:18.746 --> 55:21.183
just not in a scientific way.

55:44.706 --> 55:46.942
Oh, my Anil.

55:51.547 --> 55:54.016
Oh, Angel.

56:47.036 --> 56:49.972
- Come, come. You must be Den.
- Yeah.

56:50.005 --> 56:51.807
This is my friend Raina
and Jeeja.

56:51.839 --> 56:53.976
- Nice to meet you.
- <i>Namaskar.</i>

56:54.643 --> 56:55.811
- Thanks.
- Come, come, come.

57:05.688 --> 57:08.958
- These rains can seep to your bones.
- Thank you.

57:12.627 --> 57:13.929
Thank you.

57:15.197 --> 57:16.766
Please, have it.

57:18.032 --> 57:20.904
I have a question.

57:28.143 --> 57:29.279
My son.

57:31.112 --> 57:33.015
They were very close.

57:36.150 --> 57:39.054
I am lucky to have him
as long as I did.

57:40.288 --> 57:42.891
Angel just didn't understand
death.

57:44.025 --> 57:48.096
After that I enrolled her in the
local school for special needs.

57:48.130 --> 57:49.298
Mm-hmm.

57:49.331 --> 57:52.001
- Where she met Dr. Sen.
- Oh.

57:58.940 --> 58:00.676
Thank you.

58:03.811 --> 58:06.114
You are looking beautiful.

58:10.185 --> 58:11.788
Hello.

58:12.388 --> 58:14.757
I heard an Angel is here.

58:24.799 --> 58:25.801
Hmm.

58:29.003 --> 58:32.141
This is good.
I can't. That's it.

58:32.174 --> 58:34.342
Thank you for your hospitality.

58:34.375 --> 58:37.379
I wish we had a doctor
like you sooner.

58:37.413 --> 58:38.581
Oh, thank you.

58:38.614 --> 58:41.984
Who are we to say what the
right time is, she is here now.

58:42.016 --> 58:44.686
Oh, so sweet.

58:45.286 --> 58:49.091
If you don't mind me asking,
how did Angel's mother die?

58:56.364 --> 58:59.132
Complications during childbirth.

59:02.837 --> 59:08.310
Our people thought that
when someone was born,

59:08.342 --> 59:11.946
- not right, they were cursed.
- Hmm.

59:11.980 --> 59:14.717
That's why we named her Angel.

59:14.750 --> 59:15.685
Hmm.

59:15.717 --> 59:19.355
But, uh, her mother
could not take the guilt

59:19.388 --> 59:24.226
and she felt responsible,
so she ended her life.

59:25.893 --> 59:31.066
Thankfully we had
another angel here to help.

59:42.210 --> 59:46.348
Oh, my goodness.
Beautiful tea garden.

59:46.380 --> 59:47.917
Yeah, wow.

59:59.895 --> 01:00:02.230
Mrs. Borah, come here and dance.

01:00:02.264 --> 01:00:07.370
<i>Music unites people of different backgrounds
no matter what the socioeconomic setting is.</i>

01:00:44.172 --> 01:00:47.042
- Just don't bother.
- There's got to be a ramp.

01:00:48.043 --> 01:00:51.547
I doubt wheelchairs were invented
during the time this was built.

01:00:54.148 --> 01:00:56.551
Please move on,
I will join you later.

01:00:56.585 --> 01:00:58.521
- Yeah?
- You sure? - Sure.

01:00:58.554 --> 01:01:00.156
Okay.

01:01:02.023 --> 01:01:04.793
You sure? Okay.

01:01:04.826 --> 01:01:06.194
See you.

01:01:16.938 --> 01:01:19.542
- Beautiful.
- Out there is my temple.

01:01:19.574 --> 01:01:22.177
Seriously?
After that trek?

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:25.480
- Look at this.
- Yeah.

01:01:27.114 --> 01:01:31.186
- What's your ideal world?
- Ramp in every public place.

01:01:31.219 --> 01:01:34.055
- Yeah.
- Roll a mile on my chair.

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:36.458
Actually, I wish I could.

01:01:36.491 --> 01:01:39.195
I guess what I mean is,
I wish everyone had the ability

01:01:39.228 --> 01:01:41.197
to put themselves
in each other's position.

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:43.933
- Think about it, Raina.
- Yeah.

01:01:43.965 --> 01:01:47.569
If a bully could be made to feel
his victim's pain.

01:01:48.502 --> 01:01:51.472
Right, if the physically fit could roll a
mile in the seat of someone who couldn't walk

01:01:51.505 --> 01:01:54.176
then I think there'd be
a lot more support.

01:01:56.177 --> 01:02:00.282
What is your ideal world?

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:08.257
If nothing was in my way,
I'd want to contribute to society.

01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:09.859
You do.

01:02:09.891 --> 01:02:10.960
Hmm.

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:17.498
Yes, we don't need pity.

01:02:17.531 --> 01:02:22.537
- We can contribute to society...
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:22.571 --> 01:02:26.909
- ...like anyone else.
- I agree.

01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:30.378
It's all about respect and trust

01:02:30.411 --> 01:02:33.281
and how big
and open your heart is

01:02:33.315 --> 01:02:38.454
even if you don't have
anything to begin with, hmm.

01:02:44.592 --> 01:02:47.328
We are really very happy
that you are here.

01:02:47.362 --> 01:02:48.764
Oh, thank you.

01:02:48.797 --> 01:02:53.402
Niladri's mother believes that his
love of music extended his life.

01:02:53.435 --> 01:02:56.304
Oh, at least my neonatal studies
proved useful.

01:02:56.337 --> 01:03:00.542
It would be best for all of us
if you made progress.

01:03:00.574 --> 01:03:04.545
There is an expert in Indian
classical raga and philosophy.

01:03:04.578 --> 01:03:06.347
You may like to meet her.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.283
- Yeah, I would love that.
- Yes.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:49.058
Let us all be happy.

01:03:50.192 --> 01:03:54.931
Let us all be free from illness.

01:03:55.563 --> 01:04:00.002
Let all see the auspicious.

01:04:01.536 --> 01:04:07.944
Let us all be free from misery.

01:04:10.277 --> 01:04:16.118
You know, most of the people
who lead a materialistic life

01:04:17.351 --> 01:04:21.022
often feel
they are missing something

01:04:22.223 --> 01:04:25.060
and they look for a purpose
in life.

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.398
All problems in life

01:04:31.366 --> 01:04:37.639
arise from materialistic
longings and desires.

01:04:37.672 --> 01:04:39.976
They are mostly psychological,

01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:46.114
but all solutions are spiritual.

01:04:46.147 --> 01:04:50.285
Um, I need to learn
how music does things like that.

01:04:51.152 --> 01:04:52.721
You know what they say,

01:04:53.388 --> 01:04:59.328
admitting and realizing that you
have a problem is the first step.

01:04:59.795 --> 01:05:02.331
Dr. Sen sent me.

01:05:02.364 --> 01:05:03.432
Okay.

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:08.503
Shanti. come with me.

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:11.273
Thank you.

01:05:11.306 --> 01:05:14.810
You know ragas are designed

01:05:14.842 --> 01:05:18.346
- to activate the chakras.
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:19.114 --> 01:05:22.384
You can feel so happy
that you want to dance...

01:05:23.652 --> 01:05:28.657
...and sometimes it makes you
so sad that you want to cry.

01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:48.209
You know, Raina,
there is a note for every mood.

01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:52.814
- My fiancé is a musician.
- Yeah?

01:05:52.848 --> 01:05:56.118
I remember him ranting about classical
music being at a different frequency

01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:57.786
- than modern recordings...
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:59.487 --> 01:06:03.792
...and, um, in my neonatal work I witnessed
the calming effect, so, you know.

01:06:03.824 --> 01:06:07.128
I have a story,
I will tell you later.

01:06:07.161 --> 01:06:08.596
Okay.

01:06:09.797 --> 01:06:11.500
Come with me.

01:06:42.931 --> 01:06:46.469
Den, Den, what happened?

01:06:47.335 --> 01:06:48.838
My father died.

01:06:49.603 --> 01:06:52.140
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.

01:06:54.875 --> 01:06:58.781
I need to be independent.
I need a job.

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:02.683
Okay. We'll get you a job.
Okay? No worries.

01:07:05.286 --> 01:07:07.288
We are covered.

01:07:07.322 --> 01:07:10.359
- As far as I am concerned the job is yours and I'm just...
- Raina.

01:07:15.897 --> 01:07:19.735
Okay, here we go.
It's okay. Don't worry.

01:07:20.502 --> 01:07:21.603
Thanks.

01:07:21.636 --> 01:07:23.172
6Yes.

01:07:24.772 --> 01:07:27.708
- Oh, you're Den.
- Yes, that's me.

01:07:27.741 --> 01:07:30.778
I am Omar, the station manager.

01:07:30.811 --> 01:07:34.449
- Hi, I am Raina.
- Raina, very nice to meet you.

01:07:34.482 --> 01:07:36.951
- I'm just here for luck.
- Okay. Come on.

01:07:36.985 --> 01:07:38.654
Yeah.

01:07:38.686 --> 01:07:42.723
<i>♪ ...win ♪</i>

01:07:42.757 --> 01:07:47.396
<i>♪ Let me be brave
Let me be strong ♪</i>

01:07:47.429 --> 01:07:48.497
<i>♪ Let me be wrong ♪</i>

01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:50.898
<i>I was so happy
that Den got the job.</i>

01:07:50.931 --> 01:07:52.266
Beautiful.

01:07:52.299 --> 01:07:54.201
<i>♪ Let me be brave ♪</i>

01:07:54.235 --> 01:07:57.906
<i>In many ways Den became my mentor, so
it was important for me to help him anyway.</i>

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:06.248
Oh, nice. I love it. Nice.

01:08:07.514 --> 01:08:09.551
<i>And what are
all these charges on the Amex?</i>

01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:13.422
<i>They called about suspicious activity
from a department store in Calcutta.</i>

01:08:13.455 --> 01:08:15.357
That's where I am.

01:08:15.389 --> 01:08:17.993
<i>Yes, but why are you shopping
in the men's department?</i>

01:08:18.026 --> 01:08:20.395
Max, it's late. Okay?

01:08:20.428 --> 01:08:21.697
I have a little work to do and...

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:23.765
<i>Put me on video chat.</i>

01:09:06.907 --> 01:09:09.910
So today we are going to be listening
to different genres of music

01:09:09.944 --> 01:09:12.580
to see which one you
all respond to.

01:09:12.613 --> 01:09:14.750
The first one is
gonna be country.

01:09:23.624 --> 01:09:25.761
What you think?

01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:49.384
Next, rock and roll.

01:09:55.956 --> 01:09:57.759
Good, Yes.

01:09:59.427 --> 01:10:01.063
Oh, God.

01:10:05.499 --> 01:10:09.337
Hi, Den, slow down.
You are going to take my job.

01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:11.873
Go on.

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:17.946
And now the soothing
sounds of classical music.

01:10:24.052 --> 01:10:27.723
No sleeping. I see you.
Don't fall sleep. Okay.

01:10:37.065 --> 01:10:40.902
Next, we are going to listen to
someone that I know very well.

01:10:40.935 --> 01:10:43.772
My boyfriend from America
has a heavy metal band,

01:10:43.804 --> 01:10:45.740
so let's see
if you guys like this.

01:10:56.817 --> 01:10:58.887
Okay, okay.

01:11:02.856 --> 01:11:05.092
Everybody relax.

01:11:07.195 --> 01:11:12.467
Out, it's out. It's out. Okay.
Relax. Everybody relax.

01:11:22.643 --> 01:11:24.879
<i>The longer I stayed in India,</i>

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:29.118
<i>the more I realized what a perfect
place it was to study music therapy.</i>

01:11:30.084 --> 01:11:32.821
Come,
I will take you to that side.

01:11:35.923 --> 01:11:37.792
You know,

01:11:37.825 --> 01:11:42.530
- raga is not meant to be composed.
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:42.563 --> 01:11:46.601
It's...
it's sort of a generator,

01:11:47.168 --> 01:11:49.204
like the Deepak Raga

01:11:49.236 --> 01:11:53.708
when sung properly
can create fire,

01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:56.545
but that doesn't matter,

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:58.446
there is the Megh Mallar

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:02.651
which brings the rain
down to sooth the Earth.

01:12:09.057 --> 01:12:12.527
<i>Their culture is known
for keeping the body in harmony,</i>

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:17.865
<i>and this mindfulness is made possible
through rhythm, vibration, and music.</i>

01:12:17.898 --> 01:12:19.234
Let's go that side.

01:12:19.267 --> 01:12:22.070
Is that the story
you wanted to tell me?

01:12:25.973 --> 01:12:31.480
I knew a teacher who had
a boy in her class,

01:12:32.112 --> 01:12:34.182
who did not like to study.

01:12:34.214 --> 01:12:39.520
- Never paid attention, never responded to her.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:39.553 --> 01:12:44.926
But one day she was
humming a song and he liked it.

01:12:46.527 --> 01:12:50.965
- He asked her to sing along.
- Right.

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:56.137
- So she said that, yes, I will sing if you study...
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:56.169 --> 01:12:58.873
...and he gladly did so
after that.

01:12:58.906 --> 01:13:00.875
What was the song?

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:04.012
The song was based
on Raga Bhairav,

01:13:05.012 --> 01:13:07.114
it stimulates the heart

01:13:07.882 --> 01:13:13.120
and it made him feel
a sense of security,

01:13:13.954 --> 01:13:18.092
love, and fearlessness.

01:13:19.994 --> 01:13:22.864
It's... it's important
to all of us

01:13:22.896 --> 01:13:27.268
- and it makes us all feel the same way.
- Right.

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:31.806
But it is more important
for an autistic child.

01:13:31.838 --> 01:13:33.774
Hmm. I believe you.

01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:39.548
You know, the whole universe

01:13:39.981 --> 01:13:44.652
- is created by energy.
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:48.723
- Including colors and sounds.
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:50.892 --> 01:13:53.295
It all connects us together,

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:59.868
each one of us
to the sound of <i>Omkara.</i>

01:14:01.201 --> 01:14:02.102
<i>Omkara.</i>

01:14:14.115 --> 01:14:17.352
Excuse me, can you tell me where
I can find Den Roy? Mailroom.

01:14:17.384 --> 01:14:20.088
Uh, do you mean
that wheelchair dude?

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.222
- Yeah.
- That side.

01:14:22.255 --> 01:14:23.691
- Okay. Thank you.
- Welcome.

01:14:23.725 --> 01:14:25.192
Ma'am, please sign here.

01:14:30.164 --> 01:14:31.700
Mm.

01:14:45.879 --> 01:14:47.315
- Hey, Den.
- Yeah.

01:14:47.347 --> 01:14:50.384
Who was that lady here?
She is not your mother.

01:14:50.418 --> 01:14:52.687
Now just don't tell
that she is your girl.

01:14:52.719 --> 01:14:55.624
Raina.
Raina is just a friend of mine.

01:14:55.656 --> 01:14:58.058
- No nothing like that.
- Okay, okay.

01:14:58.092 --> 01:15:00.762
...Oh, Den, I have to scoot.
...Okay.

01:15:00.794 --> 01:15:02.364
- Okay, see you.
- Bye.

01:15:03.196 --> 01:15:04.732
- Hey, Den.
- Yeah.

01:15:04.766 --> 01:15:06.768
- You too come in.
- Okay.

01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:17.712
- So you say her name is Raina, right?
- Yes.

01:15:17.745 --> 01:15:19.247
- She is from America.
- Okay.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:24.219
She is researching on the effect of
music therapy in helping disabled people.

01:15:24.252 --> 01:15:26.321
Wow! That's great.

01:15:26.353 --> 01:15:27.923
Just one minute.

01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:31.926
Hey, Omar.
Can you just come in here?

01:15:37.264 --> 01:15:40.835
Spectacular, isn't it?

01:15:43.471 --> 01:15:47.174
Can you do combined trials
with their academic work?

01:15:47.842 --> 01:15:51.079
Some may need
more attention than others.

01:15:51.111 --> 01:15:52.713
Palek is already calmer.

01:15:54.014 --> 01:15:56.918
Great progress.

01:16:06.427 --> 01:16:09.230
Good evening, friends,
welcome to Radio India.

01:16:09.262 --> 01:16:13.701
This is Renny and we have a special
guest in our studio, Den Roy.

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:18.873
And he is here to tell us about what a friend
of his is up to over at the Hope Institute.

01:16:18.905 --> 01:16:20.274
Welcome, Den.

01:16:20.307 --> 01:16:22.810
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:16:22.843 --> 01:16:26.181
students with a variety
of developmental challenges

01:16:26.213 --> 01:16:32.986
are using music as a tool to facilitate
their physical and academic goals.

01:16:50.137 --> 01:16:53.874
<i>Den quickly moved out
of the mailroom and on the air.</i>

01:16:53.907 --> 01:16:55.776
Hmm, Den is doing a great job.

01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:58.012
Yeah, he is fantastic.

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:03.985
<i>Den inspired Angel
and Jeeja to find work.</i>

01:17:05.119 --> 01:17:08.023
I'm really happy to be
associated with the foundation.

01:17:08.556 --> 01:17:13.895
Any help in social services.

01:17:13.928 --> 01:17:16.264
- You are welcome.
- Happy.

01:17:19.133 --> 01:17:22.203
Hi, you are on air with Ren
and Den, what's your question?

01:17:22.236 --> 01:17:24.405
<i>I just wanted to
say, I think it's great</i>

01:17:24.437 --> 01:17:27.174
<i>that people like you are taking
time out for the disabled.</i>

01:17:27.208 --> 01:17:30.378
Okay, Den will answer this.
Thank you so much for calling.

01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:33.413
Actually, I am an
individual with disabilities.

01:17:33.446 --> 01:17:38.485
I have been blessed with an opportunity
to be the voice of the people.

01:17:38.518 --> 01:17:43.090
You, listeners, can't see,
but Den here is confined to a wheelchair.

01:17:43.124 --> 01:17:44.493
Uh, Renny is right.

01:17:45.159 --> 01:17:49.364
What I have is similar
to cerebral palsy but worse.

01:17:49.396 --> 01:17:52.933
For a long time in my life I
couldn't speak a full sentence.

01:17:52.967 --> 01:17:55.303
Den, Den.

01:17:55.335 --> 01:18:00.407
<i>Den was able to use his platform to
help those who needed it even more than him.</i>

01:18:06.079 --> 01:18:10.184
<i>We all set out to deliver
care packages in the slums.</i>

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.356
Oh, careful.

01:18:15.923 --> 01:18:18.560
Oh, I thought
America had some bad places.

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:21.196
This isn't safe
for you two alone, okay?

01:18:24.432 --> 01:18:26.401
You are back with Den.

01:18:26.433 --> 01:18:32.072
By now you have those images
of your loved ones in your mind.

01:18:33.173 --> 01:18:39.847
Can you imagine those women being
attacked brutally on their way home?

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:45.253
I am here to bring a voice to
the woman of abuse everywhere.

01:18:47.655 --> 01:18:49.324
Who is that?

01:18:51.258 --> 01:18:54.428
Hello. Hello.

01:19:01.168 --> 01:19:03.103
Come.

01:19:04.737 --> 01:19:08.576
<i>What we found was something even more
horrifying than people in poverty.</i>

01:19:11.945 --> 01:19:14.215
Come, come.

01:19:15.316 --> 01:19:17.485
Easy, easy,
easy, easy, easy, easy.

01:19:17.517 --> 01:19:20.187
We are here to help you.
We are here to help you, okay?

01:19:20.987 --> 01:19:22.456
Yeah, here. Here you go.

01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:24.392
- What's your name?
- Sofia.

01:19:24.424 --> 01:19:26.427
Okay,
do you live with your parents?

01:19:26.459 --> 01:19:27.661
Here.

01:19:30.063 --> 01:19:32.366
- Oh, my God!
- Come, come, come.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.070
Jeeja, Angel.

01:19:41.308 --> 01:19:43.110
It's only a matter of time.

01:19:44.011 --> 01:19:46.947
Go, go. Go away.
I will be back.

01:19:48.382 --> 01:19:50.151
We have to get
out of here, okay?

01:19:50.183 --> 01:19:53.922
I want to but they have
my sister. I can't leave her.

01:19:53.954 --> 01:19:56.089
There has to be something
that could be done.

01:19:56.123 --> 01:20:00.361
It's child prostitution, drugs,
she has autism!

01:20:00.393 --> 01:20:02.196
These are the real slum dogs.

01:20:02.963 --> 01:20:05.532
The authorities
are not at all trustworthy.

01:20:06.167 --> 01:20:08.503
One accusation
to the wrong person,

01:20:08.535 --> 01:20:10.637
the institute loses its support.

01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:12.106
Then I'll go to the authorities.

01:20:12.138 --> 01:20:14.174
An American female,

01:20:14.208 --> 01:20:17.344
telling a bunch of corrupt
people how to rule?

01:20:17.378 --> 01:20:22.383
- Yeah.
- If you are not arrested or raped, you will be deported.

01:20:27.454 --> 01:20:29.690
Look, I understand.

01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:32.060
I am a woman, too,

01:20:32.493 --> 01:20:36.230
but I can't risk
this institution.

01:20:36.262 --> 01:20:38.032
I am sorry, Raina.

01:20:38.531 --> 01:20:40.534
I promised Claudia

01:20:40.567 --> 01:20:45.272
I wouldn't let your personal drive
affect your professional focus...

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.511
and pretty soon, chaos.

01:20:50.544 --> 01:20:52.680
Are you speaking
personally or professionally?

01:20:52.713 --> 01:20:54.014
Does it matter?

01:21:02.690 --> 01:21:05.026
We have to do something.

01:21:12.232 --> 01:21:14.401
Sofia?

01:21:15.535 --> 01:21:19.006
This is exactly

01:21:19.373 --> 01:21:23.678
what Den's show is about.

01:21:25.713 --> 01:21:28.349
No way, you can't. You can't.

01:21:28.382 --> 01:21:30.585
As the voice of the people,

01:21:30.618 --> 01:21:33.120
you have to help us help Sofia.

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:35.089
- Help Sofia?
- Hmm.

01:21:35.121 --> 01:21:38.092
Jeeja and you
cannot get into the slum.

01:21:38.124 --> 01:21:39.793
It is too dangerous.

01:21:39.826 --> 01:21:42.696
You have to help me.

01:21:42.730 --> 01:21:45.467
It's a bad idea. No.

01:21:48.602 --> 01:21:49.737
Angel.

01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:53.540
Angel. Angel, please.

01:21:53.574 --> 01:21:55.410
Please.

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:01.548
Angel.

01:22:03.717 --> 01:22:06.054
Angel. Stop, please.

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:08.123
Stop.

01:22:09.222 --> 01:22:11.591
Angel. Angel.

01:22:23.337 --> 01:22:25.507
Thank you.

01:22:38.585 --> 01:22:42.722
They can come any time.
I usually hide here and sleep.

01:22:42.755 --> 01:22:43.792
Okay.

01:22:44.758 --> 01:22:46.394
We need to make a plan.

01:22:48.762 --> 01:22:52.667
Record everything, okay?

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:55.603
Yeah, Sofia will record everything so that
we can get the attention of the people.

01:22:55.636 --> 01:22:56.804
- Okay?
- Yes.

01:22:57.605 --> 01:22:59.107
Let's go.

01:22:59.807 --> 01:23:01.142
Let's go.

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:33.541
Ready to rehearse? Hmm?

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:37.410
Okay everyone, this is the last
rehearsal before the concert,

01:23:37.444 --> 01:23:41.715
if anyone wants to practice their
parts before then, Hiya is available.

01:23:42.415 --> 01:23:44.185
Okay, ready?

01:24:14.847 --> 01:24:16.484
Where is the rest?

01:24:16.517 --> 01:24:19.820
That's all.
That's all I could get for it.

01:24:23.223 --> 01:24:27.561
You lie and steal from me.

01:24:32.232 --> 01:24:38.538
Your sister will wait for you to make
up the difference for your mistake.

01:24:49.782 --> 01:24:51.386
Yes, boss.

01:24:52.719 --> 01:24:54.554
Let them rape.

01:25:02.495 --> 01:25:04.798
Very good. Yes.

01:25:29.522 --> 01:25:34.828
I thought
I was the only one

01:25:34.861 --> 01:25:37.931
who could not sleep.

01:25:39.032 --> 01:25:41.502
I can't rest wondering
what is happening to her.

01:25:57.718 --> 01:25:59.687
We should have

01:26:00.587 --> 01:26:03.991
never put Sofia

01:26:04.758 --> 01:26:11.532
up to take risk all by herself.

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.737
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

01:26:18.938 --> 01:26:21.308
I didn't receive
any messages either.

01:26:23.009 --> 01:26:24.945
- It's locked.
- Hmm.

01:26:26.045 --> 01:26:29.683
- I'm really getting worried.
- No worries, no worries. I'll find them.

01:27:09.889 --> 01:27:12.426
Stop, stop, stop.
Where are you going, Ma'am?

01:27:12.459 --> 01:27:13.660
I need to get
into the slum area.

01:27:13.694 --> 01:27:17.331
The road is blocked. The slum
is not a tourist attraction.

01:27:49.663 --> 01:27:53.500
I'm searching for two, uh, girls,
like this big, uh Indian...

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:55.770
- Long hair, pretty?
- Yes.

01:27:55.803 --> 01:27:58.572
You've just
described every lost girl.

01:27:58.605 --> 01:28:01.008
You're not
allowed to proceed further.

01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:34.507
I'm too late.
My sister is not here.

01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:39.414
Come, come. Let's go.

01:29:09.776 --> 01:29:11.078
Come.

01:29:31.063 --> 01:29:35.835
Give it to the media
and make it public.

01:29:35.869 --> 01:29:37.004
Sure.

01:29:37.737 --> 01:29:43.543
I should have given you girls
more credit,

01:29:43.576 --> 01:29:46.847
if something
had happened to you,

01:29:46.879 --> 01:29:49.782
I wouldn't have forgiven myself.

01:29:49.816 --> 01:29:51.219
Thank you.

01:30:01.227 --> 01:30:03.931
- <i>Namaste, Babaji.</i>
- <i>Namaste.</i>

01:30:03.963 --> 01:30:06.600
- You are leaving too soon.
- Not yet.

01:30:07.066 --> 01:30:08.534
You can't run forever.

01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:11.938
I'm not running. It's just my way of
calming down when things get crazy.

01:30:11.972 --> 01:30:14.108
Hmm, remember,

01:30:14.975 --> 01:30:18.846
what does a monkey know
of the taste of ginger?

01:30:19.612 --> 01:30:22.048
If I meet one, I'll ask him.

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:27.154
<i>Den here,
has the voice of the people.</i>

01:30:27.187 --> 01:30:32.059
Today, I am bringing to you
the story, of life in slums.

01:30:32.758 --> 01:30:35.795
Some brave young ladies
are really hoping

01:30:35.829 --> 01:30:38.732
that you are going to do
something about this.

01:30:38.764 --> 01:30:43.236
<i>But, first, I would like to tell
you a little bit about them.</i>

01:30:44.303 --> 01:30:50.310
Angel's biggest dream at one time was
to help her mother in housekeeping,

01:30:50.343 --> 01:30:53.146
she cannot hear
and cannot speak.

01:30:53.179 --> 01:30:56.282
The difference she wants to make
speaks volume.

01:30:56.316 --> 01:31:01.022
Also with me are her friends,
Jeeja and Sophia.

01:31:24.977 --> 01:31:27.748
Ah, the concert's tomorrow.

01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:31.651
Everyone has come so far. I swear,
I mean even you would be impressed.

01:31:31.685 --> 01:31:34.754
Anyway, you know,
I guess I'll see you soon.

01:31:34.788 --> 01:31:36.924
<i>Don't rush home on my account.</i>

01:31:36.956 --> 01:31:40.393
Heh. No, I'm looking forward
to presenting my findings.

01:31:40.427 --> 01:31:43.297
<i>So was it a waste of time?</i>

01:31:43.329 --> 01:31:45.298
Hmm.

01:31:48.034 --> 01:31:52.172
<i>Namaskar.</i> I welcome you all
to this lovely evening.

01:31:52.204 --> 01:31:58.144
I would like to invite
Raina Wilson to the stage.

01:32:01.248 --> 01:32:03.183
Good evening, everyone.

01:32:03.215 --> 01:32:07.420
I am thrilled to present to you this
extraordinary event this evening.

01:32:07.454 --> 01:32:09.223
Tonight, as she mentioned,

01:32:09.255 --> 01:32:11.859
is the result of a lot of hard
work and dedication

01:32:11.892 --> 01:32:14.028
and I couldn't be prouder.

01:32:15.027 --> 01:32:17.397
When I first came to India
I didn't know what to expect,

01:32:17.431 --> 01:32:19.767
but I was certainly
up for the challenge.

01:32:19.799 --> 01:32:24.871
And these students here tonight
are not people with disabilities.

01:32:24.905 --> 01:32:28.909
They are children
with magical abilities.

01:32:28.941 --> 01:32:32.412
We give you now,
the children of Hope Institute.

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:30.404
Here is my report.

01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:35.176
Don't you want
to review it with me?

01:33:35.842 --> 01:33:38.078
I have seen the results.
Thank you.

01:33:38.111 --> 01:33:41.381
In a short time
you have documented that

01:33:41.414 --> 01:33:45.518
learning music can improve
attention, concentration,

01:33:45.552 --> 01:33:49.156
impulse control, self-esteem,
self-expression,

01:33:49.188 --> 01:33:53.026
- and many more things that we may not have noticed yet.
- Hmm.

01:33:53.058 --> 01:33:58.065
Yes, you have proven that there
is much more work to be done.

01:33:58.531 --> 01:34:01.935
- I am eternally grateful to you.
- Hmm.

01:34:01.968 --> 01:34:06.139
<i>Raina, you know your presentation
is set for next Tuesday.</i>

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:09.143
- <i>I'll see you soon.</i>
- Okay, bye.

01:34:55.955 --> 01:34:58.558
<i>Someone who cannot
understand cannot appreciate.</i>

01:34:59.892 --> 01:35:03.196
<i>People are disabled more by society
than they are their own bodies.</i>

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:06.532
Considering the numbers and
our ever-increasing lifespan,

01:35:06.566 --> 01:35:12.072
disability is a human rights issue
that will eventually affect all of us.

01:35:14.441 --> 01:35:15.509
Thank you.

01:35:15.542 --> 01:35:18.946
Okay, I'm happy to answer any questions.
Go ahead.

01:35:19.411 --> 01:35:22.249
How does music
effect the human brain?

01:35:22.982 --> 01:35:26.119
Well, we know that music
stimulates the entire brain, right?

01:35:26.652 --> 01:35:30.990
Neuroplasticity is a way to help
the brain to reorganize itself

01:35:31.023 --> 01:35:33.561
and in some cases
bypass areas of injury

01:35:34.326 --> 01:35:37.196
and affect the development
of skills in other areas.

01:35:37.230 --> 01:35:40.032
So this is why we see
therapists using singing

01:35:40.066 --> 01:35:44.038
to teach patients with severe
brain injuries how to speak again.

01:35:45.905 --> 01:35:46.806
Okay, in the back.

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.308
So what happened
to Den and Angel?

01:35:49.342 --> 01:35:52.411
These two certainly consumed
and changed your life.

01:35:52.445 --> 01:35:55.249
They changed lives
even of people they never met.

01:35:58.183 --> 01:36:00.454
The day
I was supposed to leave India,

01:36:00.486 --> 01:36:03.590
I went to the airport
but my flight got cancelled.

01:36:05.458 --> 01:36:09.029
Truth be told, I was
looking for a reason to stay.

01:36:13.999 --> 01:36:15.502
Wait here, wait here.

01:36:24.244 --> 01:36:27.179
<i>I knew when I saw them behaving
like a normal couple,</i>

01:36:27.213 --> 01:36:29.950
<i>emotionally in tune
with each other,</i>

01:36:29.982 --> 01:36:34.520
<i>if I stayed, I would only serve as a
reminder of their physical challenges</i>

01:36:34.553 --> 01:36:37.657
<i>and they didn't need any more
of that in their daily lives.</i>

01:36:37.691 --> 01:36:41.629
<i>It was time for them
and me to live normally.</i>
