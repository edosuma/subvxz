00:02.838 --> 00:04.840
My father used to
run things here.

00:04.875 --> 00:07.443
Nucky Thompson's about to
hit seven years of lean.

00:07.477 --> 00:09.437
- ( Handcuffs click )
- Which leaves us the booze.

00:09.461 --> 00:12.316
What we ship comes in.
What Nucky ships doesn't.

00:12.350 --> 00:13.684
Nucky: I've made
inquiries, Harry.

00:13.718 --> 00:15.518
Heard good things about
you from Judge Graves.

00:15.542 --> 00:18.177
- You mean you heard I play ball.
- Well, don't you?

00:19.325 --> 00:20.725
What did he promise you?

00:20.759 --> 00:23.128
- More than you ever did.
- I will ruin you.

00:23.162 --> 00:26.231
- Louis. Louis!
- It's a stroke.

00:26.265 --> 00:29.035
You got liquor, we got money.

00:29.069 --> 00:31.672
- I need cash up front.
- We got a deal.

00:31.706 --> 00:33.266
- You're carrying a child.
- ( Weeping )

00:33.290 --> 00:35.208
That is a sacred
charge from the Lord

00:35.243 --> 00:38.312
and a financial
agreement between us.

00:38.346 --> 00:40.215
I need a port to
land some cargo.

00:40.249 --> 00:43.886
My 20% includes men to
oversee the operation.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.755
This could be an
opportunity, gentlemen.

00:45.789 --> 00:48.191
We meet up and we figure
a way to take it all.

00:48.225 --> 00:50.762
- How do you propose to handle Nucky?
- Just kill him.

00:50.796 --> 00:53.332
( People screaming )

00:53.366 --> 00:56.469
- What are your talents, Mr. Slater?
- Making people stop.

00:56.503 --> 00:58.906
( Choking )

00:58.940 --> 01:00.708
Mr. Slater will be
driving me now.

01:00.743 --> 01:02.444
Margaret: A bit
cheeky, isn't he?

01:02.478 --> 01:04.179
Nucky: He's serving a purpose.

01:04.214 --> 01:05.513
When we're done, you'll leave

01:05.548 --> 01:07.783
and will not speak
a word about it.

01:07.817 --> 01:09.752
That child is for you.

01:09.786 --> 01:11.453
Don't touch me.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.055
- ( Crying )
- Rose, don't!

01:13.090 --> 01:14.824
Have you ever posed
for an artist?

01:15.670 --> 01:16.670
Manny Horvitz.

01:16.694 --> 01:18.595
- Pay him.
- I'll take care of it.

01:22.735 --> 01:24.870
You built this town. Now
you can have it back.

01:24.904 --> 01:27.573
- You're stepping down as treasurer?
- Nucky: I am.

01:27.608 --> 01:29.309
- Ingrid, is it?
- Sigrid.

01:29.343 --> 01:31.478
- Her name is what?
- Abigail.

01:31.512 --> 01:34.014
- Where is Darmody?
- He isn't here.

01:34.048 --> 01:36.150
Your husband did this to you.

01:37.419 --> 01:39.755
My father is dead. ( yells )

01:39.789 --> 01:43.059
The shooting... I never
meant for that to happen.

01:43.093 --> 01:45.928
- Agent Van Alden.
- Hands straight in front of you.

01:45.963 --> 01:48.064
And take this... ah!

01:48.099 --> 01:50.067
I intend to make a
full confession.

01:50.101 --> 01:52.703
Then Father Brennan
will marry us.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.572
The defense motion for
mistrial is granted.

01:54.606 --> 01:56.286
- ( Crowd gasps )
- This case is dismissed.

01:56.310 --> 01:58.710
Mr. and Mrs. Mueller,
welcome to Cicero.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.779
I'm sure we'll be
quite happy here.

02:00.813 --> 02:03.683
Nucky: There's roughly
160,000 acres.

02:03.717 --> 02:05.852
That land will be worth a fortune, Mrs.
Thompson.

02:05.886 --> 02:08.722
I'll need you to sign the deed back
over as soon as you get a chance.

02:08.756 --> 02:11.525
This is the only way we
could have ended, isn't it?

02:11.559 --> 02:14.695
- So who's gonna do it?
- I am.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.798
I don't see how it could
have been a wrench.

08:28.814 --> 08:30.949
how they say they'd never steal.

But you've got a family,
kids to take care of...

08:34.886 --> 08:36.287
you'll do anything,

08:36.321 --> 08:38.489

08:38.524 --> 08:40.224
What's your name again?

08:42.327 --> 08:44.362
- Nate.
- Really, I'm not.

08:44.396 --> 08:46.931
I mean, you're a
thief, right, Nate?

08:46.965 --> 08:49.900
- Mr. Thompson...
- You steal things for a living.

08:49.935 --> 08:51.535
Isn't that correct?

08:54.006 --> 08:56.908
Answer the man when he speaks.

08:57.876 --> 08:59.510
- Yes.
- Nucky: Okay.

08:59.545 --> 09:03.815
So on the one hand we
have you, Nate, a thief;

09:03.849 --> 09:05.684
on the other we have Mr.
Doyle here

09:05.718 --> 09:08.820
who owns a warehouse in
which he stores booze.

09:08.854 --> 09:10.321
One night, Mr. Doyle leaves

09:10.356 --> 09:14.425
the aforementioned
warehouse unattended

09:14.459 --> 09:17.395
while he answers nature's
call in the outhouse.

09:17.429 --> 09:20.598
The thief, spotting an
opportunity to feed his family,

09:20.632 --> 09:23.000
comes in and robs the warehouse

09:23.035 --> 09:25.937
with an unknown accomplice.

09:27.239 --> 09:31.275
Now I ask you, Mr. Doyle,
what do thieves do?

09:33.712 --> 09:36.113
- Beg pardon?
- It's a simple question.

09:36.147 --> 09:38.282
What do thieves do?

09:41.586 --> 09:44.822
- They steal things?
- Correct.

09:44.856 --> 09:47.457
That's their job...
they steal things.

09:47.492 --> 09:49.092
And warehouse owners?

09:49.127 --> 09:51.227
Store things?

09:51.262 --> 09:52.829
- Right again.
- ( Giggles )

09:52.863 --> 09:56.901
Now, who, in this scenario,
wasn't doing their job?

09:56.935 --> 09:59.870
The thief, whose entire
reason for being

09:59.904 --> 10:01.839
is to steal things,

10:01.873 --> 10:05.275
or the fucking imbecile

10:05.310 --> 10:07.879
who left the warehouse
full of liquor unlocked

10:07.913 --> 10:10.781
while he was taking
a goddamn dump?

10:13.318 --> 10:16.320
- The imbecile?
- The imbecile.

10:26.064 --> 10:28.432
I'm not angry, Nate.

10:28.466 --> 10:30.367
You were only doing your job.

10:31.837 --> 10:33.704
Thank you, Mr. Thompson.

10:33.738 --> 10:35.572
Who was your wheelman?

10:35.606 --> 10:38.808
- Rowland Smith.
- Rowland Smith.

10:42.746 --> 10:44.647
Untie him.

10:46.483 --> 10:47.884
Oh, but, before you do,

his fucking head.

"Long, long ago."

- Yes, dear.

strikes midnight.

stay up till 1923.

11:49.912 --> 11:51.113

11:51.147 --> 11:54.015
Well, you'll see him
tonight at the party.

11:54.049 --> 11:55.516
You can give it to him then.

11:55.551 --> 11:57.652
Mama, what's an "aviatrix"?

11:57.686 --> 11:59.587
A female aviator.

12:00.722 --> 12:02.924
A lady who flies an aeroplane?

12:02.958 --> 12:05.794
- Philip: Can you believe it?
- Carrie Duncan.

12:05.828 --> 12:07.896
She'll be the first
person to fly nonstop

12:07.930 --> 12:09.597
across the entire continent.

12:09.632 --> 12:11.312
She takes off from Cape
May in the morning.

12:11.336 --> 12:13.136
Just as soon as she
finishes bobbing her hair.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.370

12:21.511 --> 12:24.046

12:28.853 --> 12:30.553
The ice will be
delivered at 1:00.

12:30.588 --> 12:33.490
Make sure it's clean and
chipped into pieces.

13:02.253 --> 13:03.986
Okay.

13:04.021 --> 13:08.023
Ladies, I'd like to
introduce Evelyn,

13:08.058 --> 13:10.459
who will be joining us
here at the Artemis Club.

13:10.494 --> 13:13.028
- Hello.
- Hi.

13:13.063 --> 13:15.431
That was lovely, dear.

13:15.465 --> 13:18.134
Now, a few points of business.

13:18.168 --> 13:21.670
Given the festive
nature of the holiday,

13:21.705 --> 13:24.006
we can expect more
than the usual amount

13:24.040 --> 13:27.310
of inebriation among our guests,

13:27.344 --> 13:31.380
and requests for you to partake
will increase accordingly.

13:31.415 --> 13:33.817
I urge you to resist
this temptation,

13:33.851 --> 13:37.821
as an infraction will
result in a $25 fine.

13:37.855 --> 13:41.591
Be polite and charming,

13:41.625 --> 13:43.893
and forget what you're here for.

13:43.928 --> 13:48.298
Gentlemen remain gentlemen
only when they must.

13:51.569 --> 13:53.903
Try a darker shade of lip rouge.

13:54.972 --> 13:56.572
The Follies are in town,

13:56.607 --> 13:58.675
so we can expect a visit from Mr.
Ziegfeld.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.744
I read he's back with his wife.

14:00.778 --> 14:05.248
If it weren't for married men,
we'd be out of business, dear.

14:06.150 --> 14:07.717
Can we go to the arcade?

14:07.751 --> 14:10.387
Richard: Come on, now.
Come on. Sorry.

14:10.421 --> 14:13.390
Mr. Harrow is our
caretaker, a war veteran.

14:13.424 --> 14:14.891
Charmed, I'm sure.

14:14.926 --> 14:17.527
Gillian: Run along, darling.

14:17.562 --> 14:20.030
Take him to Heckler's Flea
Circus on the midway.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.101
Come, dear.

14:25.136 --> 14:27.137
See your room.

14:28.673 --> 14:30.941
- ( Music playing )
- ( Chatter )

14:37.014 --> 14:38.848
- What time's your train?
- Not till 6:00.

14:38.883 --> 14:41.985
She's up to 12 trunks already,
two more for my mother.

14:42.019 --> 14:43.153
It's Naples, not the moon.

14:43.187 --> 14:46.456
Naples is the moon...
the dark side.

14:46.491 --> 14:48.158
( Snickering )

14:48.193 --> 14:49.960
He's here.

14:53.832 --> 14:55.365
Dean O'Banion.

14:55.399 --> 14:57.534
I was expecting you to
come down a chimney.

14:57.568 --> 15:00.036
Uh-uh, you've been a
bad boy, Alfonse.

15:00.071 --> 15:01.304
( Chuckles )

15:01.339 --> 15:03.239
For your wife.

15:03.307 --> 15:04.808
Straight from my shop.
Happy holidays.

15:04.842 --> 15:06.243
( Speaks Italian )

15:06.277 --> 15:08.945
Four whiskeys over here. Sit.

15:16.987 --> 15:19.622
So, what brings me
to the South Side

15:19.656 --> 15:21.457
on a cold winter's day?

15:21.491 --> 15:23.793
You don't mind sending
your beer over here.

15:23.827 --> 15:25.961
Whatever could you mean?

15:25.995 --> 15:28.898
It was settled, Dean...
the territories.

15:28.932 --> 15:31.100
Now, Jake says
you're encroaching.

15:31.135 --> 15:33.670
- Is that what Jake says?
- You deny it?

15:33.704 --> 15:35.705
Without equivocation.

15:35.739 --> 15:37.540
Let's drink.

15:39.509 --> 15:42.244
- Salud.
- Sláinte.

15:45.581 --> 15:47.049
Good stuff.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.484
Harder to come by every day.

15:49.518 --> 15:51.453
Another reason you gotta
respect the boundaries.

15:52.488 --> 15:53.955
As I said, Al...

15:53.989 --> 15:56.591
or you have some
mozzarella in your ears?

15:56.625 --> 15:58.726
What's that supposed to mean?

15:58.761 --> 16:00.561
I'm asking you are
you fuckin' deaf?

16:00.596 --> 16:02.997
Hey, his kid's deaf.

16:04.066 --> 16:06.500
But I'm sure he
meant no offense.

16:09.471 --> 16:12.240
Peace on earth, goodwill to men.

16:14.243 --> 16:15.923
Now, the territories,
as I understood them,

16:15.947 --> 16:17.512
was that the north
side belongs to me.

16:17.547 --> 16:18.847
The south is yours,

16:18.882 --> 16:20.349
but my pal Spike O'Donnell

16:20.383 --> 16:22.017
runs the Kerry Patch
south of here.

16:22.051 --> 16:24.653
Up to Cass Avenue.
North of that's ours.

16:25.722 --> 16:27.656
Then I stand corrected.

16:27.690 --> 16:29.157
I believed I was doing business

16:29.192 --> 16:30.993
on Mr. O'Donnell's
turf with his consent.

16:31.027 --> 16:33.462
And I believe you're
full of shit.

16:42.873 --> 16:44.674
Good day, gents.

16:47.444 --> 16:50.212
Oh, and say hello to your boy,

16:50.247 --> 16:52.047
or at least wave.

16:52.081 --> 16:54.683
- Go. Get him out of here!
- You bastard!

16:55.751 --> 16:58.186
( Speaks Italian )

16:58.220 --> 17:00.501
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- My fuckin' kid, John.

17:00.525 --> 17:01.889
( Speaking Italian )

17:01.923 --> 17:03.958
But is it worth a war?

17:05.127 --> 17:07.694
Behave yourself, okay?

17:07.730 --> 17:10.464
I don't want no problem
while I'm gone.

17:10.499 --> 17:12.166
My New Year's resolution.

17:12.201 --> 17:15.002
- I'm serious, Al.
- I know.

17:15.037 --> 17:17.638
A lot of money at stake, huh?

17:23.546 --> 17:26.714
Later on, I'm gonna
see that fuck.

17:26.749 --> 17:29.884
I thought you made a resolution.

17:29.919 --> 17:32.720
Well, New Year's
ain't till midnight.

17:32.755 --> 17:34.522
( laughing )

17:34.557 --> 17:36.157
Get me a drink.

17:44.165 --> 17:46.466
Harry, Jess, how are you?

17:46.501 --> 17:49.569
- Harry: Good to see you, Nuck.
- You've met Mayor Bader,

17:49.604 --> 17:52.972
our County Treasurer
Damien Fleming.

17:53.007 --> 17:54.240
Your old job.

17:54.275 --> 17:56.042
Those two-hour naps
must be grueling.

17:56.077 --> 17:58.378
( laughing )

17:58.412 --> 18:00.180
All settled in at the Blenheim?

18:00.214 --> 18:01.548
Just for the day, I'm afraid.

18:01.582 --> 18:03.250
So you'll miss my shindig.

18:03.284 --> 18:05.118
- Too bad.
- Harry: Duty calls.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.754
Or in our case Secretary Mellon,

18:07.788 --> 18:10.189
the grand poobah of the
Treasury Department.

18:10.224 --> 18:11.824
We're back to Washington
on the express,

18:11.859 --> 18:13.927
and with that gorgeous
view of the ocean.

18:15.229 --> 18:17.630
I'd say you fellas are
getting splashed enough.

18:18.866 --> 18:20.467
That article in the
"New York Times"?

18:22.436 --> 18:24.538
Untermeyer's got
an axe to grind.

18:24.572 --> 18:27.174
If Untermeyer were
the only woodsman.

18:27.208 --> 18:30.210
The Veterans Bureau, this business
with the oil company now...

18:30.245 --> 18:31.655
Sinclair.

18:31.679 --> 18:33.319
You boys are quite
popular with the press.

18:33.343 --> 18:35.182
'23 will be better.

18:35.217 --> 18:37.652
It's '24 I'm worried about.

18:37.686 --> 18:39.787
Harding's got a
snowball's chance.

18:46.996 --> 18:48.830
So I'll see you boys tonight?

18:50.366 --> 18:51.967
Sure thing.

18:54.404 --> 18:56.005
Gentlemen.

18:57.775 --> 19:01.110
Eddie, why don't you show Mr.
Smith here the cigar stand?

19:01.145 --> 19:03.847
The Fatimas are quite nice.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.821
( Door closes )

19:10.856 --> 19:13.191
Let's cut the bullshit,
shall we, Harry?

19:13.225 --> 19:16.027
You fellas are going down, and
you're not taking me with you.

19:16.085 --> 19:17.605
- Come on, Nuck.
- "Come on," your ass.

19:17.629 --> 19:19.363
40 grand a month in protection,

19:19.398 --> 19:20.480
and that's not even
counting the others...

19:20.504 --> 19:21.609
40 grand a month

19:21.633 --> 19:24.073
- is not 5% of what you're making.
- Remus, Rothstein, Torrio.

19:24.097 --> 19:25.369
And every time I open a paper,

19:25.403 --> 19:27.871
there's a new goddamn
investigation.

19:27.905 --> 19:30.240
Maybe it's time you
dismounted that high horse.

19:30.274 --> 19:32.041
I seem to recall a few articles

19:32.076 --> 19:33.843
about your legal
troubles as well.

19:33.878 --> 19:36.512
A year and a half ago. I'm
a philanthropist now.

19:36.547 --> 19:38.648
You're a gangster,
plain and simple.

19:38.683 --> 19:41.818
- I run a tight ship, Harry.
- You run an open-air bazaar...

19:41.853 --> 19:44.354
alcohol to the highest bidder.

19:46.824 --> 19:48.525
Hmm.

19:52.297 --> 19:54.498
People being murdered
on the roads?

19:54.532 --> 19:57.401
Tabor Heights is nearly
60 miles from here.

19:57.436 --> 20:00.271
Well, how long before this
place hits the headlines?

20:00.305 --> 20:02.340
You're telling me how
to conduct my affairs?

20:02.374 --> 20:05.376
All I'm saying is you
live in a glass house.

20:05.410 --> 20:08.579
Then let's leave it
at that, shall we?

20:09.848 --> 20:12.083
Fine.

20:14.253 --> 20:16.688
About the money...

20:16.722 --> 20:19.090
in an effort to keep the
press hounds at bay,

20:19.125 --> 20:21.626
starting soon, I will be
accepting cash directly.

20:21.660 --> 20:24.429
- I'll pay Jess?
- I'm backing Jess off this.

20:24.463 --> 20:26.898
I have a middleman.
He'll be in touch.

20:32.772 --> 20:35.673
- ( Chuckles )
- ( Liquid pours )

20:35.708 --> 20:37.741
What do you make of
this lady flier?

20:37.776 --> 20:39.276
She should spread her legs

20:39.311 --> 20:41.178
and leave spreading the
wings to her husband.

20:41.213 --> 20:42.813
( Chuckles )

20:42.847 --> 20:45.916
While we continue to expand
our surgical capabilities.

20:45.950 --> 20:48.218
Last week a thoracic surgeon
was added to our staff,

20:48.253 --> 20:50.554
and he performed a
revascularization.

20:50.588 --> 20:52.656
I won't pretend to
know what that is.

20:52.691 --> 20:54.331
Dr. Landau: The pericardial
sac is opened,

20:54.355 --> 20:56.861
and upon closure, the
scar tissue that forms

20:56.928 --> 20:59.163
sends oxygenated blood
to the ischemic heart.

20:59.197 --> 21:01.165
And to the left we
have our brand-new

21:01.200 --> 21:04.302
Enoch and Margaret
Thompson Pediatric Annex.

21:04.337 --> 21:06.905
No longer does St.Theresa's
play second fiddle

21:06.939 --> 21:09.074
to the Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia.

21:09.108 --> 21:11.777
Thanks to the Thompsons,
first-rate pediatric care

21:11.812 --> 21:14.013
is now available right
here in Atlantic City.

21:14.047 --> 21:16.042
Well done.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.084
We're quite pleased to
have been able to help.

21:18.118 --> 21:21.320
As we continue to
modernize our facilities,

21:21.355 --> 21:24.890
we plan eventually to affiliate
with a major university.

21:24.925 --> 21:27.394
We envision a day when
Penn Medical students

21:27.428 --> 21:29.429
will have their first
clinical experience here...

21:29.463 --> 21:32.364
- Woman: Someone help.
- At St. Theresa's.

21:32.399 --> 21:34.099
Please.

21:34.134 --> 21:36.335
- A teaching hospital...
- ( Dripping )

21:36.369 --> 21:37.970
( gasps ) Oh!

21:38.005 --> 21:42.076
Oh! Dr. Mason! Nurse!

21:44.780 --> 21:47.849
- We need a gurney.
- Orderly, get a gurney.

21:47.883 --> 21:49.717
I'm very sorry you
had to witness that.

21:49.752 --> 21:51.519
McCaully: Let's adjourn
to the boardroom.

21:51.554 --> 21:53.874
The new landscaping for courtyard...
we're choosing hedges.

21:53.898 --> 21:55.367
- We need a lady's opinion.

21:55.592 --> 21:58.102
- Man: Are you thinking
cypress or boxwood?

21:58.126 --> 21:59.726
Man ♪2: My wife is
partial to hydrangeas.

21:59.750 --> 22:03.152
Dr. Landau: Ah, well, the
lady will know better...

22:16.673 --> 22:18.874
( music playing within )

22:23.679 --> 22:25.747
( knocks )

22:26.715 --> 22:28.850
( music continues )

22:39.660 --> 22:42.428
( knocking )

22:52.738 --> 22:56.073
- Mr. Posner?
- Yes?

22:56.107 --> 22:58.908
Good day, sir. My name
is George Mueller.

22:58.943 --> 23:01.377
I represent the Faraday
Electric Iron Company.

23:01.411 --> 23:03.212
Is the lady of the
house in as well?

23:03.246 --> 23:05.580
What? No.

23:05.615 --> 23:07.181
What is it you're selling?

23:07.215 --> 23:09.083
Your wife requested
some information

23:09.118 --> 23:11.952
on a product that could save
her hours of backbreaking...

23:11.987 --> 23:13.854
It's New Year's Eve, bub.

23:13.888 --> 23:15.589
Yes, sir. If I could
just come in...

23:15.623 --> 23:17.024
What'd I just say?

23:17.058 --> 23:19.092
If you want, come
back next week.

23:19.127 --> 23:22.029
The thing is, sir, the company's
holding a sales contest.

23:22.063 --> 23:24.599
Today is the last...

23:24.633 --> 23:28.136
- Mrs. Posner: Who was that?
- Mr.Posner: Some peddler. I don't know.

23:28.170 --> 23:30.572
A real lummox.

23:30.606 --> 23:32.774
( Music playing )

23:39.181 --> 23:40.548
Barker: Hurry, hurry!

23:40.583 --> 23:43.218
Step right up, boys.
Win a prize.

23:43.252 --> 23:45.687
Ladies, does your man
have a steady hand?

23:45.722 --> 23:48.390
Fellas, are you aiming
to impress your gal?

23:48.424 --> 23:50.264
- ( Pops )
- Well, come on over and take a shot

23:50.288 --> 23:52.061
at the Great Plains
Shooting Gallery.

23:52.096 --> 23:54.130
One dime is all it takes.

23:54.164 --> 23:57.166
Two nickels, 10 pennies.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.601
You like animals?

23:58.635 --> 24:00.870
( Barker continues
indistinctly )

24:09.746 --> 24:12.048
That's enough, pal.

24:12.082 --> 24:14.049
( Mutters )

24:15.252 --> 24:17.453
Here we go.

24:19.023 --> 24:22.025
Did your dad teach you to shoot?

24:22.059 --> 24:25.395
Actually, it was my sister.

24:27.398 --> 24:30.967
Your dad was a good shooter.

24:31.001 --> 24:34.938
- He killed bad guys in the war.
- That's right.

24:34.972 --> 24:37.007
Rudy, the Congo Creep.

24:37.041 --> 24:38.642
Hoppy, the Frog Boy...

24:38.676 --> 24:40.878
been here since he
was just a tadpole.

24:40.912 --> 24:43.714
- ( Trumpets ) - Ladies and
gentlemen, Baby Henry...

24:43.749 --> 24:47.752
One time, his leg got hurt and
he had to go to the hospital.

24:47.786 --> 24:51.088
- Who told you that?
- My mama.

24:52.157 --> 24:56.160
Your mother was a
beautiful woman.

24:57.363 --> 25:00.665
- She painted pictures.
- No, she doesn't.

25:00.699 --> 25:02.099
She did.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.702
She painted the one in my room.

25:06.304 --> 25:09.641
She's taking me to
the movies tomorrow.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.209
- Who is?
- My mother.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.378
You mean Gillian.

25:14.413 --> 25:16.481
That's what I said.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.383
Can we get some cotton candy?

25:20.652 --> 25:23.988
( Elephant trumpets )

25:24.023 --> 25:27.692
Gentlemen, Mrs. Thompson, thank
you for a terrific year.

25:27.726 --> 25:30.028
- Always a pleasure.
- Happy New Year.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.531
- Margaret: And to you as well.
- We'll see you tonight, then?

25:32.565 --> 25:35.233
We'll be looking forward to it.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.275
Dr. Mason?

25:44.310 --> 25:46.077
I'm Margaret Thompson.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.113
We met at the holiday luncheon.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.616
Yes, of course.

25:51.818 --> 25:54.253
I was wondering, the
woman earlier...

25:54.287 --> 25:56.455
how is she?

25:56.490 --> 26:00.726
She's resting, but
unfortunately she miscarried.

26:02.529 --> 26:04.730
I'm so sorry.

26:04.765 --> 26:06.466
It was unnecessary.

26:07.969 --> 26:11.405
Her baby's death, it could
easily have been prevented.

26:11.439 --> 26:15.208
She miscarried most likely
due to an E.Coli infection.

26:15.242 --> 26:17.277
If someone had told her
to avoid raw milk,

26:17.311 --> 26:19.246
her baby would be alive.

26:22.383 --> 26:24.351
You're on the board
of this hospital,

26:24.385 --> 26:26.219
Mrs. Thompson, are you not?

26:26.254 --> 26:28.155
- I am.
- Then you might be interested to know

26:28.189 --> 26:31.391
that we do not provide even the
most elementary prenatal care.

26:31.426 --> 26:34.895
We do not instruct women
in nutrition or hygiene.

26:34.929 --> 26:37.298
They are ignorant
about their bodies,

26:37.332 --> 26:39.800
and what you saw
today is the result.

26:41.236 --> 26:43.971
And what do you expect me to do?

26:47.108 --> 26:49.309
Nothing.

26:53.348 --> 26:56.050
Mickey: Move it along, fellas.

26:56.084 --> 26:59.754
I wanna finish up early,
bid adieu to '22.

26:59.789 --> 27:01.356
( Giggles )

27:01.390 --> 27:04.260
Well, look who's slummin'.

27:04.294 --> 27:08.731
- Where's your partner?
- Eating his lunch. ( Giggles )

27:08.765 --> 27:11.601
Munya, we got company.

27:11.635 --> 27:14.170
You don't tell me when
the boss comes around?

27:14.204 --> 27:17.674
I just did, for Christ's sake.

27:17.708 --> 27:19.876
Nucky. What brings you?

27:19.910 --> 27:22.345
I put some feelers out.

27:22.379 --> 27:26.849
This Rowland Smith... he's
hiding in Willow Grove.

27:26.884 --> 27:28.751
Your old neck of the woods.

27:28.786 --> 27:30.720
Outside Philly.

27:30.755 --> 27:32.522
Spare him the interrogation

27:32.557 --> 27:35.592
and leave the body as a message for
anyone else who'd like to rob us.

27:35.627 --> 27:37.261
These fuckers need
to learn respect.

27:41.266 --> 27:43.033
Is there a problem, Manny?

27:44.736 --> 27:47.071
New Year's Eve.

27:47.105 --> 27:50.808
My wife makes a little party.

27:50.842 --> 27:52.509
( Sighs )

27:52.544 --> 27:54.879
You were destitute
and desperate.

27:54.913 --> 27:57.181
Do you remember
how I helped you?

27:59.451 --> 28:01.452
And I helped you as well.

28:05.791 --> 28:07.892
I do this for you,

28:07.926 --> 28:10.462
but I want my own still,

28:10.496 --> 28:13.231
my own operation.

28:13.265 --> 28:15.633
Friends should not
become partners.

28:15.668 --> 28:19.036
Mickey? He's your friend?

28:19.071 --> 28:22.072
What else to call the putz?

28:25.410 --> 28:28.579
Okay, Manny. You have
yourself a deal.

28:28.613 --> 28:30.281
You won't be sorry.

28:30.315 --> 28:31.882
Three months from now,

28:31.917 --> 28:33.851
I'll be stuffing your
pockets with money.

28:33.885 --> 28:35.619
Rowland Smith...

28:36.755 --> 28:39.256
just make sure he's
dead before tomorrow.

28:45.281 --> 28:47.441
- Girl: No, no, no, no, no!
- Van Alden: Oh, excuse me.

28:47.465 --> 28:51.134
- Excuse me. ( chuckles )
- Ow!

28:51.169 --> 28:53.203
- ( Girl shrieking )
- I'm very... very sorry.

28:53.238 --> 28:55.572
- ( Shrieking continues )
- ( Chattering )

29:00.845 --> 29:04.981
"Every day in every way I am
getting better and better."

29:08.319 --> 29:12.922
"Every day in every way I am
getting better and better."

29:24.968 --> 29:26.803
Good afternoon. My
name's George Mueller.

29:26.837 --> 29:27.981
I'm with the Faraday
Electric Iron...

29:28.005 --> 29:29.472
I thought you were the grocer.

29:29.506 --> 29:31.007
No, ma'am, I'm with
the Faraday...

29:31.041 --> 29:33.009
Take it on the arches.

29:34.445 --> 29:36.846
Happy New Year.

29:38.616 --> 29:40.717
( Music playing )

29:54.664 --> 29:57.099
- Woman: Hi, Nucky!
- Hey, great party, Nucky.

29:57.133 --> 29:59.301
Thanks, Damien.

29:59.335 --> 30:02.003
Man: Hey, Nucky,
great to see you.

30:02.038 --> 30:03.571
Woman: The party's swell.

30:03.606 --> 30:05.106
Nucky: Thank you. Hi.
How are you?

30:05.140 --> 30:07.580
- Woman ♪2: You look lovely, Margaret.
- Woman ♪3: Hey, Nucky.

30:07.604 --> 30:08.743
Nucky: Nice to see you.

30:08.777 --> 30:10.345
- Terrific night, Nucky.
- Thanks.

30:10.379 --> 30:13.615
- You look beautiful, Mrs. Thompson.
- Well, thank you.

30:13.649 --> 30:15.716
Oh!

30:15.751 --> 30:18.952
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear I was in Egypt.

30:18.987 --> 30:23.190
- How did you manage?
- Oh, we simply studied the photographs.

30:23.224 --> 30:25.559
Afraid I'm getting credit
where credit's not due.

30:25.593 --> 30:27.627
My wife is responsible
for all of this.

30:27.662 --> 30:30.964
Imagine it... a worthless
desert far as the eye can see,

30:30.999 --> 30:35.235
but right there underfoot, a
treasure of untold millions.

30:36.237 --> 30:38.538
I can imagine it, actually.

30:38.573 --> 30:40.173
Excuse us.

30:42.843 --> 30:45.912
- Excuse me a moment.
- What is it?

30:49.517 --> 30:51.384
Bring him down.

30:51.419 --> 30:54.187
- Just for a few minutes.
- ( Sighs )

30:54.222 --> 30:56.356
Why not?

30:58.726 --> 31:01.027
There he is...

31:01.062 --> 31:02.662
Pharaoh himself!

31:02.697 --> 31:05.365
Eddie. Glad you could make it.

31:05.399 --> 31:06.900
Make it? I wouldn't miss it.

31:06.934 --> 31:08.568
Easier than a schlep to Egypt.

31:08.603 --> 31:10.370
And better libation,
I'd wager, too.

31:10.404 --> 31:13.774
- Probably a safe bet.
- Only one way to find out.

31:14.743 --> 31:16.244
You must be the Boy King.

31:16.278 --> 31:18.913
My boyish charms went out
with the horse and buggy.

31:18.947 --> 31:22.049
- Now this lad here...
- Mm!

31:22.084 --> 31:24.318
Hello, handsome. And
who would you be?

31:24.352 --> 31:25.719
Theodore Thompson, ma'am.

31:25.754 --> 31:27.554
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

31:27.589 --> 31:31.391
Well, I'm Lillian Kent, but
you can call me Billie.

31:31.426 --> 31:33.126
All my pals do.

31:33.161 --> 31:34.728
He is darling.

31:34.762 --> 31:37.598
Oh, when he chooses to be.

31:37.632 --> 31:40.200
- Is that a real leopard?
- Teddy.

31:40.234 --> 31:43.269
With what that furrier dunked
me for, I should hope so.

31:44.505 --> 31:47.440
All right, then, back
upstairs with you.

31:48.442 --> 31:50.443
Ready to sing for our supper?

31:50.478 --> 31:52.278
One more and I will be.

31:52.313 --> 31:54.480
Oh, make that a double.

31:54.515 --> 31:56.816
Here's how.

31:59.219 --> 32:00.987
Ah.

32:05.359 --> 32:08.027
( Muffled music playing )

32:08.062 --> 32:10.396
You see that?

32:10.431 --> 32:12.198
Look closely.

32:12.233 --> 32:14.801
That's her name.

32:16.738 --> 32:19.740
"Ange"...

32:19.774 --> 32:22.309
"Angela Darmody."

32:22.343 --> 32:25.945
- That's my last name.
- Of course it is.

32:25.980 --> 32:29.615
I want to make a picture.

32:29.650 --> 32:31.483
Okay.

32:39.025 --> 32:42.227
There we go. Hop up.

32:59.948 --> 33:03.150
- What are you drawing?
- A horse.

33:03.185 --> 33:05.486
Very nice.

33:09.358 --> 33:14.262
You know, she drew me
once, your mother.

33:14.296 --> 33:16.464
A long time ago.

33:16.499 --> 33:18.166
Gillian: What was?

33:19.334 --> 33:22.070
- Gillian.
- What was a long time ago?

33:23.072 --> 33:25.907
Mm, the war.

33:25.941 --> 33:28.376
Is that a suitable topic?

33:31.147 --> 33:34.049
- What are you boys doing?
- Making a picture,

33:34.083 --> 33:35.684
like my mother.

33:35.718 --> 33:38.620
She painted that one.

33:38.654 --> 33:41.623
I'm your mother now, remember?

33:41.657 --> 33:44.125
Yeah.

33:45.327 --> 33:48.529
Well, come with Mama.
It's time for bed.

33:55.871 --> 33:57.538
Good night.

34:06.583 --> 34:09.752
( Distant laughter )

34:24.768 --> 34:26.837
- ( bell jingles )
- Dean: We're closed.

34:26.871 --> 34:30.139
- Even for me?
- Al.

34:31.976 --> 34:34.311
I thought Torrio had
you on a leash.

34:35.480 --> 34:38.447
Well, he left town and
I chewed through it.

34:39.985 --> 34:43.085
- ( Vase shatters )
- Whoops.

34:44.589 --> 34:47.157
You really wanna do this?

34:47.190 --> 34:50.193
Sorry, I... I couldn't hear you.

34:50.228 --> 34:52.963
( Door opens, bell jingles )

34:54.965 --> 34:57.367
Hey-o, Tommy! Where
the fuck you been?

34:57.401 --> 34:59.269
- I beg...
- Shut your yap and look smart.

34:59.303 --> 35:01.271
We got company.

35:04.842 --> 35:08.378
Now, what were you saying?

35:08.413 --> 35:11.948
- Watch your step, Deanie.
- This is my joint, Al,

35:11.983 --> 35:13.784
on the north side of town.

35:13.818 --> 35:18.121
Unless you want a taste of
what's in that suitcase there...

35:22.060 --> 35:24.328
I'd watch my own
step, I was you.

35:39.178 --> 35:40.712
Come on.

35:40.746 --> 35:43.315
( Glass crunches )

35:44.918 --> 35:47.018
( bell jingles )

35:52.859 --> 35:55.060
( locks clicking )

35:56.729 --> 35:58.964
Jesus!

35:58.998 --> 36:01.032
That was beautiful!

36:01.066 --> 36:03.468
I don't know who you are, mister,
but you just made a pal.

36:03.502 --> 36:06.270
I'm George Mueller with the
Faraday Electric Iron Company.

36:06.305 --> 36:09.373
- Dean O'Banion. Hey, you married?
- I am.

36:09.407 --> 36:11.508
Yeah? How about this?

36:11.542 --> 36:13.576
I'm gonna make you
a swell bouquet

36:13.611 --> 36:16.179
to take home to Mrs.
Mueller, huh?

36:18.082 --> 36:19.516
( laughs )

36:19.550 --> 36:21.918
- What, is it irons you're selling?
- Yes, sir.

36:21.953 --> 36:25.956
- They'll save you hours of...
- Eh, give me two dozen. How's that?

36:27.025 --> 36:28.693
I...

36:28.727 --> 36:30.094
yes, sir.

36:30.129 --> 36:32.964
- Thank you.
- Well, you're a good man, Mueller.

36:32.999 --> 36:35.367
You got a nice poker face.

36:37.604 --> 36:39.405
Hey, you ever want a real job,

36:39.439 --> 36:42.341
just ask around about
Deanie O'Banion.

36:42.375 --> 36:44.843
- ( Music playing )
- Two dozen?

That Cantor...
luckiest Yid alive.

38:21.775 --> 38:24.276
Miss Kent is no typical chorine.

38:24.310 --> 38:27.045
You speak from experience?

38:27.079 --> 38:29.380
I speak as her landlord, Mr.
Yale.

38:29.415 --> 38:31.349
The second luckiest Yid alive.

38:31.383 --> 38:33.418
Apartment house of
mine on West 57th.

38:33.452 --> 38:34.852
A tenant.

38:34.887 --> 38:37.521
Now Remus has heard everything.

38:37.556 --> 38:40.224
You can tell Remus it
happens to be true.

38:44.296 --> 38:45.897
Gyp, you made it.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.601
How was the trip down?

38:50.636 --> 38:52.637
Flat tire. You believe it?

38:52.671 --> 38:55.173
Near Tabor Heights,
by any chance?

38:55.207 --> 38:57.608
Spent the last eight hours
washing grease off my hands.

38:57.642 --> 38:59.710
Aren't you gonna introduce
us to your date?

38:59.778 --> 39:01.411
Of course. Where are my manners?

39:01.446 --> 39:04.448
Scruffy, meet Charlie Luciano.

39:05.817 --> 39:07.484
What's that?

39:07.519 --> 39:09.119
She says you remind
her of her brother.

39:09.154 --> 39:11.856
- In your case, that's a compliment.
- ( Men chuckle )

39:11.890 --> 39:15.359
Gyp Rosetti, meet George Remus.

39:15.393 --> 39:16.861
A pleasure.

39:16.895 --> 39:18.562
A little whiskey to warm you up?

39:18.597 --> 39:20.798
This one's got ice
water in his veins.

39:20.832 --> 39:22.366
Take a lot more than whiskey.

39:22.401 --> 39:23.935
Take a lot more
than that whiskey.

39:23.969 --> 39:25.469
Remus has the good stuff.

39:25.504 --> 39:27.271
Speaking of which,
we need to talk.

39:27.305 --> 39:29.265
Getting a lot of demand for
rum, and that stuff...

39:29.289 --> 39:30.908
Cleopatra requests
your presence.

39:30.942 --> 39:33.744
That's okay. I wasn't really
interested in finishing my thought.

39:33.778 --> 39:36.046
Relax, Gyp.

39:36.081 --> 39:37.815
It's a party.

39:37.849 --> 39:40.083
( Fanfare plays )

39:42.720 --> 39:45.021
A toast from our host!

39:45.056 --> 39:46.523
( Applause )

39:46.557 --> 39:49.625
Stir the eggnog,
raise the toddy.

39:49.660 --> 39:51.127
Happy New Year, everybody.

39:51.161 --> 39:53.062
- ( All cheering )
- Happy New Year!

39:53.096 --> 39:55.897
To Nucky and Margaret Thompson!

39:55.965 --> 39:59.168
- All: Hear, hear!
- ( Fanfare plays )

40:02.473 --> 40:04.340
Who ate the last
of the sardines?

40:04.375 --> 40:06.009
I saw a stray cat go by.

40:06.043 --> 40:08.178
Oh, there's liverwurst
there as well.

40:08.212 --> 40:11.182
Hank: Say, Georgie boy!
How's tricks?

40:11.216 --> 40:13.117
I made 24 sales.

40:13.151 --> 40:15.253
- You don't say.
- That's quite a haul.

40:15.287 --> 40:17.222
Ralph: Not for a
closer like George.

40:17.256 --> 40:20.659
- Every no is one step closer to a yes.
- Hank: It certainly is.

40:20.693 --> 40:22.694
Ralph: Except you're a day
late and a dollar short.

40:22.728 --> 40:25.229
Yeah, $500 to be precise.

40:25.264 --> 40:27.031
Phil there is the big winner.

40:42.548 --> 40:44.249
I've got the order slips.

40:44.283 --> 40:46.685
Two dozen irons. That
puts me ahead by seven.

40:46.719 --> 40:49.554
That's swell, George, and you'll
certainly get your commission,

40:49.588 --> 40:51.122
but the contest is over.

40:51.157 --> 40:52.857
You missed the tally.

40:54.260 --> 40:55.560
10:00 p.m., you said.

40:55.594 --> 40:57.434
- Phil: You don't know onions.
- Ralph: Onions?

40:57.458 --> 41:01.298
Must be all the sawdust
between those cauliflowers.

41:01.333 --> 41:03.734
Woman: Phil, stop.

41:03.768 --> 41:05.335
The deadline was 9:00, George.

41:05.370 --> 41:07.570
You said 10:00 p.m., Mr.
Gulliver.

41:07.605 --> 41:09.305
It's after hours.
Call me Scotty.

41:09.340 --> 41:11.441
I'm sure it was 10:00.

41:11.475 --> 41:14.410
Now, George, you know
there's a city ordinance

41:14.444 --> 41:16.945
that says you can't
peddle goods after 9:00.

41:16.980 --> 41:19.514
What? No, I wasn't aware.

41:19.549 --> 41:21.817
Well, sure.
Disturbing the peace.

41:21.851 --> 41:24.152
That's why the deadline
was nine bells.

41:26.522 --> 41:30.192
My wife and I were going to use
the prize money to buy a house.

41:30.226 --> 41:32.127
Oh, come on, now. Don't
be shot to pieces.

41:32.161 --> 41:34.629
- Have a drink.
- I don't consume alcohol.

41:34.664 --> 41:38.100
Well, me? I'm gonna get slopped.

41:43.574 --> 41:45.675
( Music playing )

41:48.978 --> 41:51.914
With no sleep and nearly
30 hours in the air.

41:51.948 --> 41:55.617
Can you imagine soaring
through the sky like a bird?

41:55.651 --> 41:57.452
Free?

41:57.487 --> 42:01.022
30 hours to myself is all
the freedom I'd need.

42:01.057 --> 42:03.892
Ma'am, I'm told we're
low on champagne.

42:03.926 --> 42:06.528
Thank you. I'll have
the bar restocked.

42:14.370 --> 42:16.738
Already New Year's back home.

42:16.773 --> 42:19.742
Give my best to Katy.

42:27.485 --> 42:30.588
Oh, Mrs. Thompson, what
a spectacular affair.

42:30.622 --> 42:33.558
As a rule, parties bore
me, but not this one.

42:33.592 --> 42:35.360
I'm so glad you're
enjoying yourselves.

42:35.394 --> 42:37.696
Oh, we are, very much.

42:41.634 --> 42:44.636
Dr. Landau, the woman
who came in today...

42:44.670 --> 42:47.872
As I said, I'm sorry
you had to see that.

42:47.907 --> 42:50.408
Female patient. Very sad.

42:50.443 --> 42:52.277
Yes.

42:55.815 --> 42:57.783
I was speaking with
one of the doctors.

42:57.817 --> 42:59.885
- Oh.
- He thought it might be a good idea

42:59.919 --> 43:04.022
if the hospital offered some
kind of instruction for women...

43:04.056 --> 43:06.891
health instruction,
prenatal care.

43:06.925 --> 43:09.760
Oh, really? Which
doctor was that?

43:10.762 --> 43:14.564
I... I don't recall his name.

43:14.599 --> 43:17.000
Older gentleman.

43:17.034 --> 43:20.270
His point was the entire situation
could have been prevented.

43:20.304 --> 43:21.705
Excuse me?

43:21.739 --> 43:24.274
How's everyone doing?

43:24.309 --> 43:26.878
- Sweeten those for you?
- You might have to.

43:26.912 --> 43:28.579
Your wife's just
been lecturing me

43:28.614 --> 43:31.182
on our hospital's complicity
in a woman's miscarriage.

43:31.216 --> 43:33.784
- No, I...
- Negligent, were we?

43:34.853 --> 43:36.720
That's not what I meant.

43:36.755 --> 43:38.956
I'm sure it wasn't.

43:38.991 --> 43:40.925
Why are we talking shop
on New Year's Eve?

43:40.959 --> 43:43.594
- ( Gong bangs )
- ( Music playing )

43:43.629 --> 43:45.330
Oh, look!

43:45.364 --> 43:46.999
It's Howard Carter himself,

43:47.033 --> 43:49.969
back from the
Valley of the Kings

43:50.003 --> 43:53.705
with New Year's baubles
for all our guests.

43:53.740 --> 43:58.644
Everyone, please come and
partake of King Tut's treasure.

44:00.781 --> 44:03.716
( Guests gasp )

44:03.750 --> 44:06.452
- A scarab brooch for you, Mrs. Landau?
- Oh!

44:06.487 --> 44:08.854
A tiepin for you, Doctor?

44:08.888 --> 44:10.522
Why, it's beautiful.

44:10.557 --> 44:12.458
Nucky: Step on up, everyone.

44:12.493 --> 44:14.160
Please, help yourselves.

44:14.194 --> 44:17.196
- These are real diamonds.
- ( All gasp )

44:36.250 --> 44:38.351
( music playing )

44:39.687 --> 44:45.091
Richard, I was wondering
if I might have a word.

44:45.125 --> 44:46.892
Of course.

44:49.029 --> 44:52.264
Do you like living here?

44:52.298 --> 44:54.033
Yes.

44:56.002 --> 45:00.305
Then I'd appreciate if you'd
stop filling Tommy's head

45:00.340 --> 45:03.443
with stories about the past.

45:03.477 --> 45:05.445
It's all very painful for him.

45:08.215 --> 45:10.150
I understand.

45:11.019 --> 45:12.853
I knew you would.

45:16.458 --> 45:18.426
Are you going out this evening?

45:19.462 --> 45:22.897
Yes. To meet a friend.

45:22.932 --> 45:25.467
Well, enjoy yourself.

45:25.501 --> 45:28.236
And let's look to the future.

45:35.577 --> 45:38.079
Hold it right there.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.721
I understand there's a
game over at the Traymore.

45:46.756 --> 45:48.857
Not if they hear you're coming.

45:48.892 --> 45:51.393
In the mood, George?

45:51.428 --> 45:53.863
Remus shuns gambling.

45:55.198 --> 45:57.333
Look, another mummy.

45:57.367 --> 45:58.902
My apologies, gentlemen.

45:58.936 --> 46:01.071
- I trust you've been enjoying yourselves.
- Mm.

46:01.105 --> 46:03.006
We're getting real friendly.

46:03.041 --> 46:05.508
I promised this Yid I'd
stick it only halfway in.

46:06.410 --> 46:07.610
As I was saying,

46:07.645 --> 46:10.714
I'll do 500 cases a
month of rum, plus...

46:10.748 --> 46:12.282
I need to stop you.

46:12.316 --> 46:14.184
I won't be selling
you alcohol anymore.

46:14.218 --> 46:16.620
- Things have changed.
- How come?

46:16.654 --> 46:18.521
It's not really your concern.

46:18.556 --> 46:21.725
Exactly the kind of high-handed
attitude that makes...

46:21.759 --> 46:24.861
I've got friends in politics,
highly placed friends.

46:24.895 --> 46:27.864
As a favor to them and for
my own peace of mind,

46:27.899 --> 46:29.833
I prefer to simplify things.

46:29.867 --> 46:31.834
Well, I got money,
you got booze.

46:31.869 --> 46:33.269
What could be simpler than that?

46:33.304 --> 46:36.305
That I sell to one buyer only.

46:36.340 --> 46:39.141
Effective immediately, I'll
be exporting exclusively

46:39.176 --> 46:42.578
from Atlantic City to Mr.
Rothstein.

46:42.612 --> 46:44.647
If you'd like, you can
buy directly from him.

46:44.681 --> 46:47.449
At a 50% markup.

46:47.484 --> 46:49.584
You could always
buy from Brooklyn.

46:49.619 --> 46:52.787
Bill Lovett, Peg-Leg Lonergan.

46:52.822 --> 46:54.856
Those Paddies won't
sell to Italians.

46:54.890 --> 46:57.224
Sorry, boys.

46:57.259 --> 46:58.893
New Year, new rules.

47:00.429 --> 47:02.564
See, that makes sense.

47:02.598 --> 47:05.134
Chink I know, runs a laundry...

47:05.168 --> 47:07.536
tells me '23 is the
Year of the Pig.

47:08.672 --> 47:10.773
This is a business decision, Mr.
Rosetti.

47:10.808 --> 47:13.677
I come all the way down here,
put up with car trouble...

47:13.711 --> 47:15.345
We all got the same news.

47:15.379 --> 47:17.981
Yeah, but we ain't all in
the same fuckin' boat.

47:18.015 --> 47:19.749
I'm gettin' squeezed
on all sides here...

47:19.784 --> 47:22.952
- ( speaks Italian )
- No, fuck you, Frank.

47:22.987 --> 47:27.090
Your fuckin' rat-hole bar and
your warehouse in Canarsie?

47:27.125 --> 47:29.159
I don't see you doing
me any favors, amico.

47:29.193 --> 47:33.495
And you... you smug kike midget,

47:33.530 --> 47:36.699
creeping around like a fucking
dentist with the ether.

47:36.733 --> 47:38.293
Why don't you watch
your fuckin' step...

47:38.317 --> 47:40.618
Why don't you go sit in
the corner, short pants?

47:42.706 --> 47:45.908
And then there's you...

47:45.942 --> 47:49.545
a fuckin' breadstick
in a bow tie.

47:49.580 --> 47:51.982
You pasty-faced, cocksucking...

47:52.016 --> 47:53.550
You must be tired, Mr. Rosetti.

47:53.584 --> 47:55.218
That can make a man irritable.

47:55.253 --> 47:58.255
- You need some rest.
- I need 500 cases of rum.

47:58.289 --> 48:01.591
You and your men... my
guests at the Ritz.

48:01.626 --> 48:03.660
What, you think I can't
float my own hotel room?

48:03.728 --> 48:06.830
I'm making a goodwill gesture.

48:06.864 --> 48:08.231
Accept it or not.

48:08.265 --> 48:10.367
- How about I make one, too?
- You'll not do it here.

48:10.401 --> 48:13.637
I'll shit you out like yesterday's
sausage, you bog-trotting prick.

48:15.806 --> 48:18.675
You're making my
decision very easy.

48:22.213 --> 48:24.914
( Guests laughing )

48:31.221 --> 48:33.656
Nobody here can take a joke.

48:34.725 --> 48:37.894
Guests: 10, nine, eight,

48:37.929 --> 48:39.897
seven, six...

48:39.931 --> 48:42.700
- ( dog yelping )
- Five, four, three,

48:42.734 --> 48:44.502
two, one...

48:44.536 --> 48:47.005
- Happy New Year!
- ( Party favors rattling )

48:47.039 --> 48:49.174
( music playing )

48:49.208 --> 48:52.210
Look, it's Father Time!

48:53.346 --> 48:56.248
Here come the New Year's babies!

48:57.317 --> 48:59.418
( Horn squawking )

49:12.599 --> 49:14.366
Thanks for a lovely evening.

49:15.869 --> 49:18.303
For your kids.

49:31.483 --> 49:36.420
- ( Music playing )
- ( Speaking Yiddish )

49:37.288 --> 49:38.989
Champagne.

50:20.630 --> 50:22.765
( Muffled chatter )

50:44.090 --> 50:46.558
I thought he was sleeping
through the night.

50:46.592 --> 50:49.428
Sometimes he's hungry still.

50:55.436 --> 50:57.804
How's Abigail's cold?

50:57.839 --> 50:59.539
Better.

51:13.721 --> 51:15.789
I lost.

51:23.263 --> 51:26.364
This year will be more lucky.

51:41.147 --> 51:44.216
These flowers are for you.

51:48.521 --> 51:49.988
Nucky: Thank you for coming.

51:50.023 --> 51:53.092
Margaret: Always
lovely to see you.

51:53.126 --> 51:55.127
Well...

51:56.629 --> 51:59.598
we made it... 1923.

51:59.633 --> 52:01.033
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

52:01.068 --> 52:03.436
In some ways I wish the
world would slow down.

52:03.470 --> 52:06.840
Hmm, you have the
right attitude, dear.

52:11.645 --> 52:14.447
- Nucky: Good night now.
- Margaret: Good night.

52:15.883 --> 52:18.084
- How dare you?
- I beg your pardon?

52:18.118 --> 52:20.586
Don't ever drag me into a
situation like that again.

52:20.621 --> 52:22.282
What situation?

52:22.306 --> 52:24.106
Your issues, whatever
your cause is this time.

52:24.130 --> 52:26.059
- My name is on that hospital.
- As is mine.

52:26.091 --> 52:27.971
And it's not to provide
you with a bully pulpit.

52:27.995 --> 52:31.096
You come and go as you please and
I do all that's required of me.

52:31.131 --> 52:32.811
Everything you do is
because I paid for it.

52:32.835 --> 52:34.915
Don't pretend you don't enjoy
playing the benefactor.

52:34.939 --> 52:37.104
You made me a benefactor
by giving that land away.

52:37.138 --> 52:38.503
I had no ch...

52:39.672 --> 52:42.740
Is it New Year's yet?

52:44.977 --> 52:46.977
Yes, dear.

52:47.012 --> 52:48.713
Could you not sleep?

52:54.519 --> 52:57.654
Tips for the staff.

53:01.292 --> 53:03.225
The bishop's office called.

53:03.260 --> 53:05.928
They need an answer regarding the St.
Gregory award.

53:05.962 --> 53:09.298
- When is it?
- A week from Tuesday.

53:09.332 --> 53:11.501
I'll think about it.

53:11.535 --> 53:13.670
Happy New Year.

53:25.316 --> 53:27.650
( Speaking Yiddish )

53:39.663 --> 53:42.599
( car approaches )

53:45.103 --> 53:47.037
( car horn honks )

53:51.243 --> 53:53.378
Maybe I come later.

54:02.321 --> 54:05.089
( Emma screaming )

54:05.123 --> 54:07.525
( distant dogs barking )

54:07.559 --> 54:10.861
( screaming continues )

54:18.770 --> 54:21.772
( clock ticking softly )

55:47.291 --> 55:49.225
Why, Miss Kent.

55:51.661 --> 55:55.430
- Surprised?
- I'm shocked.

55:57.500 --> 55:59.668
What happened to Cleopatra?
