01:10.960 --> 01:13.000
You will do all the
necessary preparations.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.920
I received proof, the Gracious
Lord showed me the way.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.760
We will meet the prisoner together.
And free him.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.660
I knew that you would show common sense.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.040
The crew is ready.
I myself take him to the ship.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.120
He must remain in France.

01:47.080 --> 01:50.000
But tell me, for God's sakes,
how can we ensure his freedom?

01:54.160 --> 01:56.480
There is only one
way to end this.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.360
You're out of your mind.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.220
We are talking about our flesh and blood.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.080
And every sigh of his -
our curse.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.400
In that case, say it directly.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.180
You need to call things
by their proper names.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.580
This is murder.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.960
We must protect what
we have created.

02:20.020 --> 02:22.380
While he is alive, the church
has the means to destroy us.

02:22.420 --> 02:24.100
And you call this justice?

02:24.200 --> 02:26.120
He has already sacrificed his life for us.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.160
He fulfilled his duty
and deserved freedom.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.920
The Lord gave his
fate into our hands.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.560
But we must carry
this cross together.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.720
You are much more
alike than you think.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.079
We want to share this moment with you.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.480
As would be done in a real family.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.560
I'm glad to see you both.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.400
We must fulfil this duty together.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.320
In this case...

04:44.040 --> 04:46.200
I drink for my sons.

05:11.880 --> 05:14.120
I thought I would never
see the sunlight again.

05:35.640 --> 05:40.320
The mask was my everyday curse.

05:41.440 --> 05:46.680
And at night I only
prayed that a dream come.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.400
And now...

05:54.200 --> 05:55.440
finally...

05:58.520 --> 06:00.560
I will be free.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.120
I am grateful to you for this.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.360
Thank you, my sons.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.800
There is a time to love

07:23.480 --> 07:25.080
and a time to hate.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
And now it's time

07:27.240 --> 07:29.280
Go ahead without the
burden of the past behind.

07:30.320 --> 07:33.200
The nation is divided, and
our people are disunited.

07:33.360 --> 07:37.000
The time has come to unite our
subjects once and for all.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.560
Royal Wedding

07:38.720 --> 07:40.440
enliven the people.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.400
And France will unite again

07:42.400 --> 07:43.440
and become a family.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.280
At the moment, the most important thing
for me is the security of the people.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.020
I have to think first of all about France.

07:48.060 --> 07:50.140
Does His Majesty want to
strengthen the borders?

07:50.520 --> 07:53.040
Emperor Leopold disposed of with
the Ottomans, as we feared.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.200
And now, no doubt, he will
again aim at Luxembourg.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.800
In that case, we will seize
it before Leopold's arrival.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.560
We will strike at them with all might.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.800
Is there news about our
Protestant forgers?

08:04.120 --> 08:06.680
At the moment we do not have
any exact evidence, sir.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.440
In that case, look for it better.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.920
Meanwhile, I'm going to
cancel the Edict of Nantes.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.080
But...

08:17.440 --> 08:20.920
it was adopted to protect the
beliefs of all citizens.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.660
We have already shown tolerance
for traitors to the Huguenots.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.880
I would like to warn His Majesty
of such radical measures.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.980
I insist on this as far
as my position allows.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.520
France is a Catholic country.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.020
How can you call yourself a family,

08:33.080 --> 08:35.200
if we are not united by one faith?

08:35.600 --> 08:39.360
Religion divides us, but also
thanks to it we will unite again.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.760
Under one faith, one law

08:43.159 --> 08:44.320
and one king.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.680
What the hell is going on here?

08:51.840 --> 08:53.720
Decided to teach a lesson to my brother.

08:55.480 --> 08:56.920
We will not see him here again.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.680
All the better!

08:59.280 --> 09:00.960
So, that's enough! Stop it!

09:02.000 --> 09:04.400
Listen, I'm serious.
I'm ready to fight.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.200
If you want to kindle a fire,
help me to stir up trouble.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.480
So that we all finish, like poor Monsieur Golovin?
- It is not your fault.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.040
Of course, it's to blame.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.280
"And I have to live with this.
"No, stop, people need you.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.720
Did not you say that you need
to unite to protect yourself?

09:20.400 --> 09:22.080
I think I was wrong.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.760
Welcome to the circle of your
elect, Monsieur de Pans.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.800
Now you are a nobleman.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.480
I'm sure you will feel at home.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.480
You are waited here for great
success, my dear Guillaume.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.080
Honestly, I want
to pinch myself.

09:57.260 --> 09:58.900
I can not believe that
this is all true.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.160
I'd like to warn you...

10:00.840 --> 10:04.360
To enjoy life in Versailles, it is
better to forget about your principles.

10:04.520 --> 10:08.520
We all make our sacrifices in
order to become a part of it.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.640
Yes, I hope it's worth it.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.560
It all depends on which
side to look at.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.600
You had to give up your faith.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.440
Is not it?

10:23.080 --> 10:25.760
Before I got here, I was a
soldier and a merchant.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.800
And look where I am now.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.160
Do not you regret anything?

10:32.560 --> 10:34.720
We are doing everything to survive.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.080
Any news about
troublemakers from Paris?

11:07.320 --> 11:09.520
The issue with the printer is settled.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.600
Once and for all.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.200
Good.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.720
Continue to follow the
order in the streets.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.960
I know that you were
there last night.

11:27.360 --> 11:31.040
The prisoner was undoubtedly
very close to the king.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.880
The poor man chose
to settle his life.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.760
And took his story with him.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.200
About him no longer have to say.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.240
Clear?

11:53.240 --> 11:54.240
Jeanne?

11:56.120 --> 11:57.120
You must read it.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.800
"He can not do this.
"What is it?

12:06.480 --> 12:09.280
All Protestants must
renounce their faith,

12:09.720 --> 12:11.640
or to suffer from the
consequences of failure.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.400
Does the king really think that
you can challenge the history?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.720
I'm not sure I understand you, madam.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.880
Nantes edict was a
declaration of humanism.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.480
He wants to return to the Middle Ages?

12:32.140 --> 12:36.220
The king unites France,
making it a Catholic state.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.280
Everyone knows that you
can not make an omelette,

12:38.720 --> 12:40.400
without breaking eggs.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.080
He seeks to dispose not only
of our bodies, but also souls?

12:44.120 --> 12:47.600
The king will do everything necessary.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.780
And the people will be grateful to him.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.680
In this case, I feel sorry for the people.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.520
In the name of tranquillity in the palace

12:56.680 --> 12:58.840
all Protestants from now on

12:59.080 --> 13:01.280
should not leave their quarters.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.400
This is the king's order.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.760
Is it necessary to sneak up like this?

13:17.920 --> 13:20.320
Yes, especially when you track a rat.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.800
Very funny.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.652
Be content with your
rude jokes and leave wit

13:23.677 --> 13:25.364
to those who understand
something about it.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.600
I think you are close to
some noble Protestants.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.720
Maybe.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.880
But I'm a faithful Catholic.

13:33.040 --> 13:36.120
With the reputation of the offender rules.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.960
And, perhaps, with a
talent for falsification.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.320
Absolute nonsense.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.960
Where did your wit go?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.720
And where did your conscience go?

13:52.080 --> 13:54.240
Be kind not to leave the palace.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.400
Princess Isabella...
Welcome, dear cousin.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.680
Good. My father gave me all
the necessary documents.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.320
But I need an exhaustive
list of my duties,

14:54.480 --> 14:57.280
as well as recommendations
regarding the wardrobe.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.920
You will help me, will not you?

15:02.320 --> 15:05.520
I think we will quickly
find a common language.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.640
I have to admit, I'm
a little worried

15:10.240 --> 15:11.960
waiting for a meeting
with the king.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.960
I do not at all doubt,

15:14.520 --> 15:16.960
that you will be a
pleasant surprise for him.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.400
This is the Portuguese Infanta, sir.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.080
Some consider it a successful party.

15:26.240 --> 15:29.520
I'm going to introduce my new
wife without my permission?

15:30.040 --> 15:33.440
I think everyone is in charge
of the Princess Palatine.

15:33.880 --> 15:37.160
Perhaps she understands something in secular
games, but she is far from politics.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.080
No, it's not her doing,

15:40.320 --> 15:42.080
someone else pulls the strings.

15:48.760 --> 15:52.880
I ordered the Bresaola from
Lombardy itself. Try it.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.960
Is it worth drawing a conclusion from
this that you do not like our cuisine?

15:57.840 --> 16:00.280
Too varied for me.
My stomach is better tolerated

16:00.520 --> 16:02.520
more simple dishes.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.040
Your grapes are sweet,

16:05.840 --> 16:08.800
but Roman wine, for my
taste, is too strong.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.400
And what do you say about our proposal?

16:14.080 --> 16:16.320
I think it should
awaken your appetite.

16:16.560 --> 16:20.000
Before signing an agreement with the Vatican,
I would like to discuss the conditions.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.220
You are not in a
position to negotiate.

16:22.920 --> 16:25.480
Now, when my niece is
the queen of Spain,

16:25.720 --> 16:29.760
I want, as you expected, to
expand my empire to Portugal.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.520
The Vatican will be happy.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.160
But I will not marry an infant.

16:37.880 --> 16:42.560
The church would prefer an
alliance based on blood ties,

16:43.160 --> 16:45.240
but not on spilled blood.

16:48.520 --> 16:51.000
I'll take Portugal in my own way.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.200
This marriage -

16:55.280 --> 16:56.640
the only thing,

16:57.360 --> 16:59.120
which will strengthen our treaty.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.680
Unless you want the world
to know who you really are.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.560
I am the son of Louis XIII 
and Anne of Austria.

17:09.079 --> 17:12.079
And no living soul can
prove the opposite.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.200
In that case, I need
to leave immediately.

17:23.160 --> 17:26.720
The pope wishes to confirm your
excommunication as soon as possible.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.360
This is impossible, given that
I suggest you stay longer.

17:37.480 --> 17:40.080
You dare to treat
a servant of Rome

17:40.320 --> 17:41.840
as with a prisoner?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.080
No.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.080
Of course no.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.400
As with my guest.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.000
Congratulations, sire.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.040
Many have already changed their faith.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.020
They demonstrate their
wisdom and faithfulness.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.080
And what about those who refuse?

18:45.200 --> 18:47.840
Make a list to assess the
scale of the problem.

18:48.560 --> 18:52.000
And you are not going to
discuss this on the council?

18:52.240 --> 18:54.640
I do not think that it is necessary.
And you?

19:50.960 --> 19:53.160
When I think about what we
turned into, I get sick.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.260
You are making a serious mistake.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.880
You are cruel to your people, and
I'm talking about all of us.

20:03.040 --> 20:06.080
I just, as I can, do my
duty to the country,

20:06.240 --> 20:07.320
with prayer

20:07.560 --> 20:08.560
and wisdom.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.680
You still consider yourself a god.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.600
"But you're not even a king.
"I know perfectly well who I am.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.920
Ruler, chosen by God.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.760
But whence then the desire to
constantly remind all about it?

20:20.440 --> 20:22.240
Why prove that you
do not obey Rome?

20:22.680 --> 20:25.680
I have nothing to prove.
I do the will of the Lord.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.120
Nonsense!

20:27.280 --> 20:29.240
You improvise on the go.

20:29.400 --> 20:32.240
The Lord did not choose
you as much as me.

20:32.400 --> 20:35.600
We quarrel like
ordinary brothers.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.180
And I no longer
have to obey you.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.120
You will do everything
that you are ordered.

20:39.240 --> 20:40.880
You're an impostor! We both know this.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.000
Come on.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.760
Let's see which of us is nicer to God.

20:52.840 --> 20:56.280
You already killed our father,
what prevents you from killing me?

20:57.040 --> 21:00.680
Let's see which of us Cain,

21:01.240 --> 21:03.320
and who is Abel.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.200
For the beauty of youth!

21:32.480 --> 21:33.880
Oh, good old days...

21:36.280 --> 21:37.880
You were not invited.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.240
I was hoping for your support,

21:40.400 --> 21:42.800
but it seems that
you now need it.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.640
What do you want?

21:44.800 --> 21:47.240
Do you know what's going
on in Versailles?

21:47.400 --> 21:48.880
Or you have too much to do?

21:49.960 --> 21:51.240
Actually, I'm getting drunk.

21:52.120 --> 21:53.160
And I'm having fun.

21:53.320 --> 21:54.960
True? Having fun?

21:55.560 --> 21:57.040
And where is the light in your eyes?

22:02.920 --> 22:05.400
- Well... You took an extra card.
- No, he did not.

22:05.560 --> 22:06.600
Yes, he cheats, I saw.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.360
A dirty rogue.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.260
But I will wean you.

22:20.080 --> 22:23.880
Enough. You've had enough fun
for today, your highness.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.000
Come on.

22:45.760 --> 22:46.760
What?

22:47.320 --> 22:48.520
You owe us an explanation.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.680
There is nothing to explain.

22:50.820 --> 22:53.380
I do not know what happened, but
you became a shadow of yourself.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.400
Do not think that you can so
easily climb into my pants.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.720
But I did not have the
slightest intention.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.600
Then get out and leave me alone.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.600
It's not fair, Philip.

23:03.240 --> 23:04.720
We deserve more.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.240
What is the problem?

23:08.480 --> 23:10.680
I'm the one who wants to see me.

23:10.840 --> 23:13.200
Old Philip, a good soul
and a life-burner,

23:13.360 --> 23:15.200
not thinking about
anything but pleasures.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.840
You are much higher than that.

23:20.520 --> 23:21.760
True?

23:23.680 --> 23:25.560
I do not recognize you anymore.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.040
And I do not recognize myself.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.680
Louis did this to you, right?

23:48.800 --> 23:50.600
He does it with all of us

23:51.080 --> 23:52.560
anyway.

23:54.480 --> 23:56.480
You need to talk to him, Philip.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.240
He does not listen to anyone but you.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.360
You can not drop your hands.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.640
He went too far.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.360
I can not talk to him anymore.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.920
Whatever your brother has
done to you, I'm sorry.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.680
Invitation to an audience -
a great honour for me,

24:46.720 --> 24:47.720
Your Grace.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.480
But I do not know
what could help you.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.200
I was told,

24:55.840 --> 24:57.960
that no one knows the thoughts of the King

24:58.280 --> 24:59.600
better you.

25:00.520 --> 25:04.200
Recently, His Majesty keeps
his thoughts to himself.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.360
We with the king should
discuss the Edict of Nantes,

25:08.960 --> 25:11.240
before taking such
drastic measures.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.520
Do not you approve of his choice?

25:14.240 --> 25:16.120
As a defender of Europe,

25:16.800 --> 25:19.120
the clergy want only one thing -
support

25:19.360 --> 25:20.600
peace at any cost.

25:20.760 --> 25:23.720
What does not prevent you
from supporting the war.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.400
Louis defies the authority of the church.

25:26.560 --> 25:27.560
On the contrary.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.680
He proves his devotion
to the Catholic faith.

25:36.120 --> 25:39.520
I ask myself what he could find in a
lady of such humble origins as you.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.720
If only our princesses

25:43.880 --> 25:46.760
were so pious and clever.

25:50.880 --> 25:54.320
Louis wants to strengthen his empire.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.080
Dad likes it.

25:56.880 --> 25:59.880
But our good relations
can develop,

26:00.120 --> 26:03.000
Only if he marries Isabella.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.640
The king himself decides,

26:05.120 --> 26:06.560
how should he act.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.280
If he refuses to obey,

26:10.040 --> 26:12.880
he will be excommunicated from the church.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.920
Being a devoted Catholic,

26:16.360 --> 26:20.000
you do not want his
soul to be damned...

26:21.080 --> 26:22.920
as well as his empire.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.440
I did not disturb his majesty?

26:39.720 --> 26:41.160
You are always welcome, you know.

26:41.920 --> 26:45.000
But not in the last days,
if I'm allowed to notice.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.800
I was busy.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.640
Business related to the Vatican?

26:55.040 --> 26:56.280
Yes exactly.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.220
They have been bothering me for a
long time, like a pebble in a shoe.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.600
Therefore, you must
marry Isabella.

27:04.360 --> 27:08.060
You will receive the support of the Vatican and
the power in Europe that you have never had.

27:08.120 --> 27:11.960
"But the church will dictate to me its conditions.
"The church needs you the same as you do.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.820
"Let them think they drove me into a corner,
but I do not admit defeat.
"But this is not a battle.

27:15.860 --> 27:17.780
- No, this is war.
- In which you will not win.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.280
You will be excommunicated from the church,

27:21.520 --> 27:22.520
Louis.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.680
You spoke with Cardinal Leto.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.600
You, the only one I trusted.

27:38.160 --> 27:40.560
The Church is a terrible enemy.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.680
Do not challenge her.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.120
How could you deceive me like this...

27:45.280 --> 27:46.300
Think, Louis.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.800
- You could have everything.
- Except you.

27:48.960 --> 27:52.480
I am only a tiny sacrifice, and you
would protect yourself and everything,

27:52.720 --> 27:54.000
about which they always dreamed.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.960
"I will never yield to blackmail.
"You said so yourself...

27:58.120 --> 28:00.640
You must act in
your own interests

28:00.880 --> 28:02.600
and the interests of France.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.400
All this beauty...

28:29.920 --> 28:32.400
And now I do not even have
the right to sunlight.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.680
A real bait.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.200
In that case, it's
time to leave.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.760
I can not even leave the room.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.040
I could break a few hands,

28:44.520 --> 28:46.000
give somebody a bribe.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.760
Would you like me
to admit defeat?

28:51.880 --> 28:54.000
Sometimes I would like to
be born with moral values.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.480
All are born with them.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.880
But few respect them.

29:00.040 --> 29:01.720
Perhaps this is what
I love about you.

29:02.920 --> 29:05.920
Perhaps, that is why our
relations are doomed.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.800
- What are you doing?
- We protest.

29:23.280 --> 29:25.120
We know only one way to do this.

29:31.680 --> 29:32.760
Bye.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.640
Freedom of choice -

29:58.640 --> 30:00.960
that's what distinguishes a person.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.680
Do you agree, Bishop?

30:03.400 --> 30:05.840
Such are the complexities of our being.

30:06.320 --> 30:07.720
Choosing one thing,

30:08.280 --> 30:10.160
we must abandon the other.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.440
I have supported the
Church all my life.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.840
The church is a wise and loving mother.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.640
My mother, too, was wise in her own way.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.560
Even in the face of
an insoluble dilemma

30:27.720 --> 30:30.040
she understood what her duty was.

30:31.640 --> 30:33.720
Nobody can compare with it in this.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.800
The Lord granted us
his Holy Church,

30:37.960 --> 30:40.080
but a man built it in Rome,

30:40.320 --> 30:41.320
is not it?

30:41.640 --> 30:43.240
St. Paul, yes.

30:44.280 --> 30:48.000
But if the interests of Rome
do not coincide with ours,

30:49.600 --> 30:52.160
in your opinion, whose
side will the Lord choose?

30:54.400 --> 30:56.760
I cant answer.

30:56.920 --> 31:00.240
I only know that in kings

31:01.240 --> 31:03.320
you are chosen by God.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.320
And if this king

31:06.480 --> 31:09.320
will lead our church,

31:09.800 --> 31:12.960
He will need a bishop who
has great influence.

31:13.760 --> 31:16.560
Bishop, who will obey one king.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.200
The royal power is sacred.

31:39.360 --> 31:42.200
The Lord created kings to
make them his messengers.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.400
Through them, he rules on this earth.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.360
The Royal Throne

31:58.800 --> 32:00.960
does not belong to man...

32:01.720 --> 32:03.400
It is the throne of the Lord Himself.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.880
The Lord blesses you, Louis,

32:08.680 --> 32:11.520
the head of His Church in France.

33:15.640 --> 33:17.480
You missed the ceremony.

33:21.720 --> 33:24.120
I know why you avoid
your brother.

33:27.040 --> 33:29.400
Because of the prisoner, right?

33:31.640 --> 33:32.800
Now he's dead.

33:33.480 --> 33:34.800
Why talk about it?

33:40.840 --> 33:44.000
All my life I dedicated
to your family.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.800
I want to know the truth.

33:51.120 --> 33:53.600
The king is not who he claims to be.

33:54.840 --> 33:56.000
Admit it.

34:20.320 --> 34:21.480
Cardinal!

34:24.639 --> 34:26.920
I believe you had a good
time at Versailles.

34:27.800 --> 34:31.400
Kindly pass my best
wishes to His Holiness.

34:32.280 --> 34:34.639
I will tell him about
everything that happened here.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.320
I'm sure he will understand,

34:36.480 --> 34:39.560
that it is utterly impossible to be
excommunicated from your own church.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.840
Also give my thanks
for your kind offer,

34:43.360 --> 34:45.239
but I no longer
need his support.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.280
I expect that he will resume

34:47.440 --> 34:50.400
in the near future talks
with Emperor Leopold.

34:51.520 --> 34:55.120
And, by the way, know that I'm going
to assign Portugal no matter what.

34:58.480 --> 35:00.840
You've gone too far, Louis.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.320
You will not return back.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.200
Today you celebrate the victory,

35:25.120 --> 35:26.680
but tomorrow, I'm afraid,

35:27.640 --> 35:29.280
everything can change.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.800
"My hands are shaking.
"It's perfectly normal.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.960
The king is not an ordinary person.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.680
Stay yourself.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.800
I know, he will like you.

36:20.520 --> 36:22.840
Your Majesty,
Isabella de Braganza,

36:23.520 --> 36:25.280
the Portuguese Infanta.

36:26.320 --> 36:28.200
You are gorgeous.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.440
My father sends you

36:31.680 --> 36:33.040
best wishes,

36:33.200 --> 36:35.960
as well as all relevant documents.

36:43.600 --> 36:46.560
Tell me, would you marry
a king who broke ties

36:46.800 --> 36:48.040
with the Vatican?

36:48.920 --> 36:51.400
This tells me about the
strength of character.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.480
I like men with their opinions.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.320
Have you ever been
close with a man?

36:59.640 --> 37:00.700
No, Sire.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.560
Fair?

37:12.520 --> 37:13.520
Well...

37:14.080 --> 37:15.480
Maybe with one. Or two.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.720
I think there were more of them.

37:18.520 --> 37:21.200
This means that I
have valuable skills.

37:21.360 --> 37:22.440
Good.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.920
I wanted our relationship
to start with honesty.

37:27.640 --> 37:30.480
His Majesty plans to keep in
touch with his mistresses?

37:34.120 --> 37:36.000
You said yourself about honesty, sir.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.560
Your sincerity is pleasant,
even if it is inappropriate.

37:41.480 --> 37:43.800
You need instructions
regarding the wedding.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.720
Madame de Maintenon will deal with this.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.600
Yes, Sire.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.280
And, for your information...

38:03.160 --> 38:05.880
the answer to your question is no.

38:28.880 --> 38:31.920
I heard you met the
king in my absence.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.920
It was a normal conversation.

38:35.760 --> 38:38.200
What are your plans
for Protestants?

38:38.880 --> 38:41.600
You are too obtuse
in this matter.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.600
I'm not grumpy.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.960
I have principles, it's
completely different.

38:47.960 --> 38:50.840
The king calls on us
to stand by his side.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.040
I suggest you join.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.080
We did not expect you, Colbert.

38:57.320 --> 38:58.960
I heard you feel bad.

38:59.360 --> 39:03.040
It is my duty to attend
all council meetings.

39:03.200 --> 39:06.640
I updated the list of
Protestant families in Paris.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.840
We need to deal with them.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.680
Busy, sire?

39:11.160 --> 39:13.880
Those who do not renounce
their faith will be arrested.

39:14.040 --> 39:16.360
Their property -
destroyed or confiscated,

39:16.520 --> 39:19.600
and their priests are waiting
for a special punishment.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.840
Monsieur Marchal, you will unite
all the people under your command.

39:23.240 --> 39:25.880
Let them today pass
simultaneously throughout Paris.

39:26.120 --> 39:29.400
Arrest the rich, the
poor and all the rest.

39:29.560 --> 39:32.240
Without warning and mercy.

39:39.560 --> 39:40.920
You do not like something?

39:48.560 --> 39:50.600
Monsieur Marshal, I order you.

40:07.360 --> 40:08.600
No more.

40:40.080 --> 40:41.320
Sorry.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.960
I need to talk to you.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.440
Immediately.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.260
No matter what they accuse
me of, they have no proof.

40:54.120 --> 40:55.200
You are not accused.

40:55.840 --> 40:57.200
But your friends

40:57.800 --> 40:59.560
are in serious danger.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.240
I'm not leaving.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.000
For God's sake, wake up!

41:06.160 --> 41:07.840
You must leave France
as soon as possible.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.320
This is my house!

41:09.480 --> 41:11.880
I am a loyal subject
and a Frenchwoman.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.720
Louis ordered the arrest of
all Protestants tonight.

41:16.360 --> 41:19.700
- Including those who do not live in the palace?
- Their fate worries me even more.

41:19.860 --> 41:21.340
God knows what will be done to them.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.800
"I have to go to my father.
"They'll arrest you!

41:24.040 --> 41:25.640
Try to stop me.

41:26.840 --> 41:27.840
Good.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.680
Monsieur Marshal is nowhere to be found.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.960
I do not need it.
Louvois can take on

41:59.020 --> 42:01.460
command of the operation.
He will have the strength of spirit.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.640
"Are the people ready?
"Yes, Sire.

42:03.800 --> 42:06.360
But it seems your brother
also left the palace.

42:07.480 --> 42:10.000
He left for St. Cloud.

42:11.720 --> 42:14.240
Would you order him
back, your majesty?

42:16.280 --> 42:18.440
The battle is no longer to his teeth.

42:18.920 --> 42:20.000
Let him go.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.480
Already not so brave without
his musketeers, right?

43:18.520 --> 43:19.760
Do I know you?

43:25.120 --> 43:26.640
Where is the shoemaker's sister?

43:30.160 --> 43:31.360
Not here.

43:32.320 --> 43:33.420
I'll give her your message.

43:39.360 --> 43:40.360
"Stop it!

43:45.480 --> 43:48.040
- What do you want?
"I came to warn you.

43:48.680 --> 43:49.740
What happened?

43:49.800 --> 43:52.000
Have you renounced your faith?

43:52.880 --> 43:54.000
Only over my dead body.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.600
So you need to leave
Paris at once.

43:56.080 --> 43:58.640
"You are in danger.
"Do not forget, this is the man of the king.

43:58.880 --> 44:00.960
"Do not listen to him.
"Ignore me if you want.

44:01.120 --> 44:02.600
But know,

44:03.000 --> 44:04.720
the storm is approaching.

44:06.960 --> 44:08.040
And there is.

44:19.160 --> 44:22.200
And you should always ask permission
before turning to the king.

44:22.360 --> 44:23.380
As well as at my place.

44:23.440 --> 44:25.880
The king does not like direct questions.

44:26.040 --> 44:27.120
I already understood this.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.040
But you could become
my maid of honour,

44:30.520 --> 44:32.080
to help avoid mistakes.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.320
Are you okay?

44:47.520 --> 44:48.840
I have a fever.

44:49.840 --> 44:52.000
She must have caught a cold.

44:56.400 --> 44:57.560
You know...

45:00.400 --> 45:02.120
You can talk to me.

45:04.480 --> 45:05.960
I would not be so sure.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.960
The church was involved
from the very beginning.

45:10.120 --> 45:13.080
Please do not try to convince me
that you have nothing to do with it.

45:19.440 --> 45:20.840
But what's the difference.

45:24.720 --> 45:26.800
It was so destined.

45:29.920 --> 45:33.480
A king can not marry a woman
of no parent, like me.

45:38.760 --> 45:41.080
All of us are just goods.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.640
We must do what is
expected of us.

45:51.160 --> 45:53.160
I did nothing else.

45:58.200 --> 46:00.080
That's why I'm suffering right now.

46:03.520 --> 46:07.080
By the will of God, I
lost a man whom I love.

46:11.280 --> 46:13.120
Marriage is like death.

46:15.720 --> 46:18.120
His time is determined,

46:19.920 --> 46:21.680
and it can not be avoided.

46:48.840 --> 46:49.900
I want to enrol

46:50.040 --> 46:51.440
how best for my country.

46:52.760 --> 46:54.240
So you do what you believe.

46:55.200 --> 46:57.520
But in the meantime, I
lost Philip and Fabien.

46:59.080 --> 47:03.040
For the first time in your life, you
are in control of your destiny.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.560
It's right that you doubt it.

47:07.880 --> 47:09.960
But you won, sire.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.240
Not yet.

47:32.400 --> 47:35.040
They ask you, madam.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.160
Sir.

47:50.320 --> 47:53.360
We will not waste time.
I want to get married today.

47:54.880 --> 47:56.480
Yes, of course, sire.

47:57.160 --> 47:59.080
"I'll send for Isabella.
- That is unnecessary.

48:02.520 --> 48:04.000
I do not understand.

48:09.760 --> 48:10.920
Francoise...

48:12.520 --> 48:14.040
Will you marry me?

48:47.440 --> 48:48.760
Open it!

48:57.840 --> 48:58.880
Everybody get out!

48:59.320 --> 49:00.680
Come on!

49:04.000 --> 49:05.720
These bastards are crazy!

49:05.880 --> 49:08.000
It was not worth giving you a chance.

49:08.160 --> 49:10.160
He told the truth.

49:13.240 --> 49:14.260
Forward!

49:15.840 --> 49:16.860
Let her go!

50:15.520 --> 50:17.120
Let's go to!

50:17.280 --> 50:18.300
Back off!

50:19.240 --> 50:20.400
We need her.

50:24.360 --> 50:25.400
Come along.

50:42.320 --> 50:43.440
Father!

50:43.680 --> 50:45.040
Take them away!

50:45.480 --> 50:46.500
Delphine!

50:52.800 --> 50:53.800
This is unforgivable!

50:54.040 --> 50:55.160
This is the law.

51:07.520 --> 51:09.600
And where is your
Protestant God now?

51:15.960 --> 51:17.160
My God

51:17.320 --> 51:19.600
damn your king!

52:31.240 --> 52:32.960
Come on, climb!

52:57.560 --> 52:59.040
The King needs to be stopped.

53:00.640 --> 53:02.320
No matter what.

53:03.305 --> 53:09.431
