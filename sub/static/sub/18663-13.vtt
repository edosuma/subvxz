13:22.440 --> 13:23.715
'cause Captain's
leg is crushed.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.594
Well, I don't need
to run a marathon.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.160
No, but you
crush enough muscle

13:28.240 --> 13:30.311
and it starts leaking
potassium into your blood.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.198
Your suit can only filter out
so much of that,

13:32.280 --> 13:33.430
then your heart stops.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.715
You know a lot
about how people die.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.633
Yeah, I guess I do.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.993
(SIGHS) Fantastic.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.311
Whatever that thing is now,
it used to be human.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.550
It's a living organism,

13:45.640 --> 13:47.438
which means it has to have
some constraints.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.432
What if we electrify the deck,
try to stun it?

13:49.520 --> 13:52.160
Okay, look. This thing rips
through steel like tin foil.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.709
<i>It doesn't need air.
It shrugs through bullets.</i>

13:54.800 --> 13:56.712
<i>You think a little electrical
shock is going to stop it?</i>

13:56.800 --> 13:58.712
Holden's standing
on that same deck.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.234
I'm trying to come up
with an alternative.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.714
- That's the problem!
- AMOS: Listen. Listen!

14:01.800 --> 14:03.120
When I was apprenticing,

14:03.200 --> 14:04.475
I did a tour
on a prospector ship

14:04.560 --> 14:05.914
outside of Pallas Station.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.555
We had a ton
of shitty equipment.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.199
One time, we were on a run

14:10.280 --> 14:12.795
and this guy's O2 regulator
valve got stuck open.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.670
<i>The pressure in his suit
went way up</i>

14:15.760 --> 14:18.036
<i>and he started losing air
out of his relief valve.</i>

14:19.440 --> 14:21.636
He got scared that he was
going to run out of air

14:21.720 --> 14:22.870
before we made it
back to the ship,

14:22.960 --> 14:24.235
so we welded the valve shut.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.640
But that would
eventually take...

14:25.760 --> 14:26.830
Yes, it burst his suit
like a balloon,

14:26.920 --> 14:28.434
and it popped him out
like a missile.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.830
Well, that's a happy story.
But what's your point?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.909
Okay, the <i>Roci's</i>
built for what?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.639
- Twenty, 30 people?
- Yeah.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.552
Well, since it's just us,
we have air to spare.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.394
So we seal off engineering,
the reactor deck,

14:42.480 --> 14:45.075
and the machine shop,
we over-pressurize them all,

14:45.160 --> 14:46.560
we pop the hatch
to the cargo bay,

14:46.640 --> 14:49.519
it'll blow that big door right off,
along with that thing.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.280
Holden's pinned down.

14:51.360 --> 14:54.114
That kind of pressure change
will rip him apart.

14:54.720 --> 14:55.915
Maybe not.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.559
- You gotta do it.
- NAOMI: <i>No!</i>

14:58.800 --> 15:00.314
I'm going to find another way.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.153
HOLDEN: <i>Well, keep on looking</i>

15:02.240 --> 15:04.471
while you prepare to blow that
goddamn thing off my ship.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.676
That's an order!

15:21.840 --> 15:22.956
ITURBI: There. There it is.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.679
Right in the middle
of the crater.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.399
The radiation signature
of those pulses

15:26.480 --> 15:28.790
is the same as what
was recorded on Eros.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.075
The ridge structures
have grown an average

15:30.160 --> 15:32.072
of nine millimeters
since our first scans.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.510
The atmospheric acid levels
above the impact site

15:34.600 --> 15:36.910
are rising while
the temperature is falling.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.753
There's no doubt about it,
that crater is active.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.513
And we're fresh out of probes.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.280
This is where you say
we have to descend,

15:46.360 --> 15:47.919
so we can get close
for our sensors

15:48.000 --> 15:49.400
to get meaningful readings.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.073
And then you point out
that we'd be at the edge

15:51.160 --> 15:52.435
of what our ship is rated for,

15:52.520 --> 15:55.274
and that our Martian shadow's
probably going to shoot at us.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.756
Rig for atmospheric flight.
Take us down.

16:00.840 --> 16:01.830
Aye, aye, sir.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.912
(OVER PA) <i>All hands,
make ready for descent.</i>

16:18.280 --> 16:20.636
I reinforced all the seals
to the machine shop.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.791
Soon as we're done here,
we're onto the next deck.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.274
Okay.

16:26.360 --> 16:30.195
Amos. About what I did to you
on Ganymede. I'm sorry.

16:30.880 --> 16:31.996
I'm sorry.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.390
You're sorry?

16:35.000 --> 16:37.117
Yeah. I am.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.032
You said that you needed
to do something

16:39.120 --> 16:40.520
and I didn't listen.

16:41.240 --> 16:42.913
I made you put me down.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.398
That couldn't have been
easy for you.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.630
Amos.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.154
It's just that I've been...

16:48.240 --> 16:50.709
I've been trying to make
choices on my own lately,

16:50.800 --> 16:52.917
and I can't seem
to make the right ones.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.914
No one's always right.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.919
I'm sorry I hurt you.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.192
When you said
Holden could survive this,

17:08.280 --> 17:09.509
you were lying.

17:12.800 --> 17:13.869
Yeah.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.875
Do not blow the hatch
until I tell you to.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.393
ALEX: <i>Guys,
pick up the pace.</i>

17:31.960 --> 17:33.872
At this rate, that thing's
gonna get to the reactor

17:33.960 --> 17:35.155
before we can seal
everything off.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.316
AMOS: <i>In that case...</i>

17:36.800 --> 17:40.157
Hey, Doc, grab a torch and
come down here and help me.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.710
I don't know how to use one.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.190
AMOS: <i>Well, get your ass down
here and I'll show you how.</i>

17:44.280 --> 17:45.270
I'm on my way.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.192
That ain't gonna cut it.
We gotta slow this thing down.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.950
Guys, I'm gonna shut down
the drive.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.713
Maybe that's gonna
buy us some time.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.320
<i>Stand by for zero G.</i>

18:08.880 --> 18:09.916
(ALEX CHUCKLES)

18:10.000 --> 18:12.674
It's working.
It stopped digging.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.079
(PANTING)

18:27.200 --> 18:28.270
(GRUNTS)

18:42.520 --> 18:43.749
Oh, shit.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.680
It's heading back for Holden.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.511
HOLDEN: <i>If I can get my gun...
We hurt it the first time.</i>

18:49.600 --> 18:50.875
I can hurt it again.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.675
It'll buy us some more time.

19:01.480 --> 19:02.675
Oh, shit!

19:05.400 --> 19:06.720
Hell, no.
Enough of that.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.156
Sorry, Hoss. Powering up!

19:10.240 --> 19:11.230
(GROANS)

19:12.960 --> 19:14.553
(PANTING)

19:22.920 --> 19:24.718
(HOLDEN PANTING)

20:03.480 --> 20:05.517
We're reasonable people
in here.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.552
We know this wasn't your plan.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.518
And you're in
as much trouble as us.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.956
You're in as much trouble
as we are.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.997
Not sure I see it
that way, friend.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.553
This doesn't have to go hard.

20:16.640 --> 20:17.960
There's more than one way
we can do this.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.959
You're losing a lot of blood.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.153
I'll try to bleed slower.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.277
Ask him what
the alternatives are.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.154
I would love to hear
what alternatives you've got.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.230
No one has to get hurt.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.071
What we need to do now
is settle down

20:54.160 --> 20:55.674
until I can talk to Mr. Mao.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.918
So you're not going
to kill anyone?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.229
I don't have to.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.319
- (SCOFFS)
- Bullshit.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.073
They can't let me
walk out of this.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.992
- I know.
- We are only alive

21:05.080 --> 21:08.437
until Mao is sure we aren't
useful to his grand scheme.

21:27.680 --> 21:28.716
GUARD 1: Do we even
know how many?

21:28.800 --> 21:30.120
GUARD 2: Anyone we don't know,
shoot on sight.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.190
GUARD 1: Got it.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.156
Cross wind's over 300 KPH,
watch the shear!

21:48.240 --> 21:49.276
Adjusting trim.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.510
Is this your first time
diving through

21:50.600 --> 21:51.875
hot clouds of sulfuric acid?

21:52.240 --> 21:54.709
Well, there was
that one time at college.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.037
(STEADY BEEPING)

21:57.960 --> 22:00.270
The Martian ship...
It's on an intercept course!

22:00.360 --> 22:01.476
Have they target-locked us?

22:01.560 --> 22:03.119
Can't tell, sir.
There's too much interference.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.320
What the hell was that?

22:10.400 --> 22:11.914
The Martian ship, sir.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.957
God damn it! They're going
to beat us to it.

23:34.600 --> 23:35.829
(DEVICE BEEPING)

23:38.840 --> 23:40.069
What would we do with them?

23:40.160 --> 23:41.674
Blow the damn cargo doors open

23:41.760 --> 23:43.991
so that Alex can spin
that thing out of the ship.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.030
If you're trying
to protect me,

23:46.120 --> 23:48.635
I don't think an explosion
that size

23:48.720 --> 23:49.995
is going to do what you want.

23:50.440 --> 23:53.080
There has to be something.
I just can't see it yet.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.873
<i>- Just stop for a second.</i>
- Not yet.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.111
<i>- I need to talk to you. Please.</i>
- We'll talk after.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.350
No! Now!

24:01.360 --> 24:02.350
<i>It's okay.</i>

24:06.840 --> 24:07.876
Look...

24:09.080 --> 24:12.073
I've been on the other side
of this conversation.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.914
And if the next few minutes is
all we get, we should take it.

24:16.520 --> 24:17.715
Just...

24:18.720 --> 24:22.873
<i>If this is my time,
don't be an idiot like I was.</i>

24:24.600 --> 24:26.398
Don't go looking for revenge.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.712
If I die here, let me go.

24:32.640 --> 24:33.676
What?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.117
Take the ship and the guys

24:37.040 --> 24:39.475
and find someplace safe
to ride all this out.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.557
(HOLDEN GROANING)

24:44.920 --> 24:46.559

since the <i>Canterbury?</i>

24:52.560 --> 24:53.789
No.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.280
Yes. But...

24:56.320 --> 24:58.994
Only because I don't get to
spend more time with you.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.640
Revenge is the last thing
I'm thinking about now.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.149
We're not right.

25:11.480 --> 25:12.960
- We are.
<i>- We're not.</i>

<i>So unless you can see
how to get you out safe,</i>

25:17.240 --> 25:19.516
and get that thing off our ship,
don't talk to me.

on your safety,

25:35.920 --> 25:37.115
what will you take?

25:40.240 --> 25:41.754
Are you thinking about it?

25:42.640 --> 25:44.279

I'd need comm access.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.199
Argh!

25:50.280 --> 25:51.919
Sorry, you cannot
go into shock.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.233
Tell him
I'd need comm access.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.957
She needs comm access.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.360
MALIK: I can't do that.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.079
But, look...

26:01.160 --> 26:02.913
I understand
why you don't trust me.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.394
Let me trust you.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.799
Leave the Undersecretary,
and you can go.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.355
Say that again.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.240
We have Mao's
little racing ship

26:16.320 --> 26:17.800
in our other shuttle dock.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.991
Hand over Avasarala
for us to keep safe.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.832
You and the Martian
can take it and go.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.440
Tell him you need assurance
of my safety.

26:34.120 --> 26:37.431
I take the Martian
and you let us walk out.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.957
MALIK: Look,
we both know how this goes.

26:41.040 --> 26:43.430
Important, powerful people
start fighting each other,

26:44.000 --> 26:45.514
it's people like us that die.

26:46.760 --> 26:48.399
I've got nothing against you.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.359
You've got nothing against me.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.874
I need to keep control of
the Undersecretary. Not you.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.718
We exchange hostages.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.359
One of yours for Avasarala.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.389
So I know you won't shoot
us down after we launch.

27:06.440 --> 27:08.511
MALIK: This is a pleasure yacht,
not a gunship.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.112
But I'll escort you
to the hangar myself.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.040
Good enough?

27:13.280 --> 27:14.350
Give me the gun.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.517
Stop! Stop!
Don't come any closer!

27:28.600 --> 27:29.636
If I take my thumb
off this button,

27:29.720 --> 27:31.677
it'll put the air lock
in full lockdown.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.479
You'll never
get out of here.

27:33.560 --> 27:34.994
If you kill me,
you're trapped.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.678
Hey, how's it...

27:43.760 --> 27:46.320
What the hell? You're supposed
to be down there helping Amos.

27:46.400 --> 27:47.675
We're doing this wrong.

27:47.760 --> 27:48.955
Hear me out.

27:49.040 --> 27:50.997
It's a nutrient gradient.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.309
It's a nutri... What?

27:52.440 --> 27:53.510
- Jesus!
- Look.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.557
Naomi said that
the creature gets energy

27:55.640 --> 27:57.757
- from radiation, right?
- Yeah, sure.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.355
It sucks radiation
the way a tick sucks blood.

28:00.440 --> 28:01.840
First time we found
the protomolecule,

28:01.920 --> 28:04.389
it was wrapped around
a reactor core, so what?

28:04.480 --> 28:06.392
It's following
a nutrient gradient.

28:06.480 --> 28:09.154
Like leaves growing toward
light or roots toward water.

28:09.240 --> 28:11.232
Prax, we are running
out of time here.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.391
How does all this
plant shit help us?

28:13.480 --> 28:14.960
We can change the gradient.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.874
If we give it a better food
source that's easier to reach,

28:17.960 --> 28:20.111
we won't have
to force it out.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.429
We lure it out.

28:23.400 --> 28:24.436
This ship has torpedoes

28:24.520 --> 28:26.113
armed with nuclear warheads,
doesn't it?

28:26.200 --> 28:27.270
Yeah?

28:32.360 --> 28:33.589
Yeah.

28:41.480 --> 28:44.234
I'm warning you.
Do not come any closer.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.800
I swear I'll lock it down
for good.

28:46.200 --> 28:48.396
What makes you think I need
to get in the drop ship?

28:48.480 --> 28:50.153
There's nothing else
down here.

28:52.320 --> 28:55.233
Unless I've dramatically
misjudged this situation.

28:55.840 --> 28:56.990
You're right.

28:57.760 --> 28:58.910
Oh, thank God.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.639
But you haven't
locked me out yet.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.152
- Yeah.
- Because as soon as you do...

29:03.960 --> 29:06.031
There's nothing to keep you
from beating me to death.

29:06.440 --> 29:07.840
You're right about that, too.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.479
So, where do we go from here?

29:11.320 --> 29:13.391
Ask yourself.
Is he worth it?

29:13.520 --> 29:14.749
Who?

29:14.840 --> 29:16.513
The man you serve here.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.592
Does he deserve
your sacrifice?

29:20.800 --> 29:21.995
I'm an electrician.

29:22.080 --> 29:25.118
You're about to lay down your
life for an unworthy master.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.672
That's not an honorable death,
no matter what they tell you.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.679
So, if I let you in,
you'll let me go?

29:35.640 --> 29:37.040
You have my word.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.276
(BEEPS)

29:44.120 --> 29:46.351
Um, do you think that you
could throw me

29:46.440 --> 29:47.590
in one of those cargo lockers?

29:47.720 --> 29:49.234
Maybe rough me up a little?

29:49.320 --> 29:51.073
Just so they don't think,
you know.

29:55.880 --> 29:58.076
You just happened to have a
nuclear warhead lying around?

29:58.160 --> 30:00.117
We took it out of a torpedo
a while back.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.431
A good Belter
never throws anything away.

30:02.520 --> 30:03.920
So we'll carry it out
onto the hull

30:04.000 --> 30:05.832
until we get close
to the cargo bay.

30:05.920 --> 30:06.990
And then
I'll pull the shielding,

30:07.080 --> 30:08.878
and you'll throw it out
away from the ship.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.155
And hopefully,
if you're right,

30:10.240 --> 30:11.833
that creature
will go after it.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.195
I thought patching up
a bullet wound

30:13.280 --> 30:15.590
was gonna be the
strangest thing I did today.

30:15.720 --> 30:16.756
(DOOR BUZZES)

30:19.200 --> 30:21.999
I keep thinking I'll tell Mei
about this when I get home.

Normally, my stories
are about soybeans.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.235
I'm right here, Cap.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.480
If this plan doesn't work...

30:43.920 --> 30:45.195
I'll blow the hatch.

30:45.680 --> 30:48.195
There's no way this ends with
that thing inside this ship.

30:48.960 --> 30:49.996
Thank you.

30:51.040 --> 30:55.239
In case I have to kill you,
I just wanted to say thanks.

30:57.760 --> 30:59.035
You made some pretty
stupid choices

30:59.120 --> 31:00.600
since you've been in charge,
but you were always trying

31:00.680 --> 31:02.319
to do the right thing, so...

31:02.400 --> 31:03.390
Hmm.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.270
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

31:08.480 --> 31:09.675
That came out bad.

31:10.840 --> 31:13.275
I mean, you were always
trying to be a good man.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.918
Not everybody does.
Thank you.

31:17.080 --> 31:18.070
It was nice
not having to worry

31:18.160 --> 31:19.753
about being
on the right team.

31:21.920 --> 31:23.036
You bet.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.120
NAOMI: <i>Alex,
we're ready to go out.</i>

Standing by to shut down
the drive on your mark.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.313
I'm going to need
an answer, friend.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.556
I'm thinking.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.357
If you're going to do it,
take over.

31:41.440 --> 31:42.590
What?

31:43.320 --> 31:44.879
If you're going
to sell me out,

31:44.960 --> 31:46.155
I understand.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.913
It's the rational choice.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.117
But you have
to stop Errinwright

31:50.200 --> 31:52.078
before he can use
the protomolecule

31:52.160 --> 31:54.072
to wage the war
he's always wanted.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.150
You owe me that.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.594
I don't owe you anything.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.911
- My son...
- Yes, your son.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.469
I failed at my job,
and Charanpal died.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.155
I owe him. Not you.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.037
I'm paying him back
by keeping his mother safe.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.554
What the hell are you doing?

32:16.120 --> 32:17.952
If I have any value
as a prisoner,

32:18.080 --> 32:19.594
I may use it
to save your life.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.149
Gambling they haven't decided
to take you out?

32:22.240 --> 32:25.119
That's a bad bet.
I won't let you make it.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.634
I don't answer to you.

no sky, and no horizon.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.229
Eyes down.

33:29.960 --> 33:33.237
All right.
Let's extract the core.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.234
Warhead is open.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.512
Guys... It's working!

33:45.600 --> 33:47.671
NAOMI: Copy that. Prax, when
I disengage the interlock,

33:47.760 --> 33:49.035
the chamber
will try to foul shut,

33:49.120 --> 33:50.998
so I have to hold it
open manually.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.156
Keep it steady.

a little closer.

you waiting for?
