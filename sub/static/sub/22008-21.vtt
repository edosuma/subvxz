00:02.085 --> 00:03.576
<i>Previously on</i> The Blacklist:

00:03.754 --> 00:05.916
Notify security.
Our Jane Doe's been abducted.

00:06.673 --> 00:07.959
Put your hands up.

00:10.093 --> 00:12.005
Delivered as promised.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.421
- Who's she?
- Don't you worry about her.

00:14.598 --> 00:17.932
You contracted for the girl.
I'll take care of this one.

00:18.101 --> 00:22.220
- You heard Mr. Moore. Back away.
- Not without Navabi. You let her go.

00:22.397 --> 00:25.310
- I don't know who that is.
- There's no agent inside.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.262
Where are we?

01:45.772 --> 01:49.061
Wow, you... You're awake.
You startled me.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.897
The girl from the hospital,
where is she?

01:52.195 --> 01:53.686
Yeah.

01:56.742 --> 02:00.076
The taking of a life,
I've only done it a few times...

02:00.245 --> 02:02.737
...and I take no pleasure in it.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.452
Once you're gone...

02:05.667 --> 02:07.124
...we'll make it right.

02:07.336 --> 02:11.922
Send you back to the earth
the way God intended.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.613
I want a name.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.323
I don't know who that is.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.782
He abducted a federal agent
who was working your case.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.454
- I think you know him.
- I don't. I swear.

02:45.624 --> 02:49.584
All I know is that he was under contract.
I don't know his name.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.370
What do you mean, "under contract"?
Contract to do what?

02:52.547 --> 02:55.540
He cleaned up messes.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.838
- You mean people.
<i>- How would I know?</i>

02:58.011 --> 03:00.344
The elders kept us completely isolated.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.598
This guy made sure?
Anyone who found your compound...

03:03.767 --> 03:06.054
- ...he got rid of? Disposed of?
<i>- How's it work?</i>

03:06.269 --> 03:11.264
Someone stumbles upon
your little utopia, becomes a threat.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.433
And this man kills them,
gets rid of them?

03:13.610 --> 03:18.651
The man in the photo simply made sure
that the bodies never turned up.

03:18.824 --> 03:23.034
If this guy does exist, I never met him.
Only Moore would know his name.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.865
You actually think he may talk?

03:25.080 --> 03:27.868
What if I could
remember this man's name...

03:28.041 --> 03:30.158
...help you find your missing agent?

03:30.919 --> 03:33.662
- Would you let me walk away?
- Why would we agree to that?

03:33.839 --> 03:37.583
Because I'm giving you a chance
to save this young woman's life.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.716
Trade my life for hers.

03:39.886 --> 03:43.550
All you have to do is let me go,
and you get her back.

03:43.974 --> 03:47.138
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.146
- Do you know his name?
- I don't.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.567
- But I can get your prisoner to give it to me.
- By torturing him?

03:56.903 --> 04:00.817
In my experience, conventional torture
doesn't yield much truth.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.191
Which is why I employ a man with...

04:03.368 --> 04:06.202
...a more holistic approach
to enhanced interrogation.

04:06.621 --> 04:09.329
If his oxygen tank is full,
he can be here in an hour.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.788
An hour? Navabi's already
been gone for an entire day.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.915
What else do you know
about her abductor?

04:15.088 --> 04:18.627
Well, he's not part of the New Haven cult.
He was contracted.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.962
There's a paper trail,
a proof of payments.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.429
Have the FBI Financial Fraud Unit
locate Moore's accounts.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.130
Boston and Albany
are searching for leads.

04:26.308 --> 04:29.176
While we wait for Red's interrogator?
We don't have time.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.719
That man in our interrogation room
knows something.

04:31.897 --> 04:34.890
And we need to get him to talk,
like, now.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.474
Raymond.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.355
Take advantage of my offer, Harold.

04:39.529 --> 04:43.068
Brimley's an old friend, and I love
him dearly. He's not up for grabs.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.651
If it weren't Samar,
I wouldn't offer his services.

04:46.828 --> 04:50.788
Sir, let me talk to him.
Let me see if I can get him to budge.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.833
What can you possibly
say to him that we haven't?

04:54.377 --> 04:56.164
I don't know, but please...

04:56.338 --> 05:00.173
...just give me two minutes
with the man behind Samar's abduction.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.628
That's all I ask.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.170
- Slow down. Take a breath.
<i>- I tracked down the address...</i>

05:05.347 --> 05:07.964
<i>...where Garvey went
after he landed in San Jose.</i>

05:08.141 --> 05:11.350
It's a custom boat company
guarded six ways to Sunday.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.183
- Supply trucks going in and out.
- Carrying what?

05:14.356 --> 05:16.473
<i>Don't know the "what",
but got the "why."</i>

05:16.650 --> 05:20.143
I drank a couple of drivers
under the table to find out the owner...

05:20.320 --> 05:22.903
...runs some kind of monthly auction.

05:23.114 --> 05:26.983
<i>Some legit items, some black book.
Apparently he's not particular.</i>

05:30.705 --> 05:35.496
It's an auction. And if Garvey came here
with that bag, it's up for auction too.

05:35.669 --> 05:39.663
Given your obsession with getting it back,
that's the last thing you wanna see.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.332
<i>I want you to secure
an invitation to the party.</i>

05:42.509 --> 05:45.001
- This ain't no party.
- Call me when it's confirmed.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.717
I brought you here to find Samar,
not hunt for the duffel bag.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.265
I offered Harold my assistance.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.642
Now I'm just...

05:53.812 --> 05:55.474
...juggling.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.152
Mr. Moore.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.327
I don't know if you remember me.

06:15.917 --> 06:19.706
- My name is Agent Aram Mojtabai.
- I've been waiting for you.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.374
What?

06:21.673 --> 06:23.960
You're the one who...

06:24.634 --> 06:26.216
...begged for her life.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.795
You care about her a great deal,
don't you?

06:28.972 --> 06:30.554
Yes.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.659
There's something
in my personal effects.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.086
I'm sure they've been inventoried.

07:03.882 --> 07:04.918
Get it for me.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.125
I'll tell you what I know.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.762
Yeah, I was sort of thinking of...

07:11.348 --> 07:12.680
...suffocating you.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.928
You know? It's the most natural.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.978
Just put you to sleep with my hand.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.642
How thoughtful.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.315
Do you believe in God?

07:23.526 --> 07:29.318
<i>You know, like, a protector?
Sort of a guardian angel?</i>

07:31.159 --> 07:32.650
Yes, I do.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.494
I don't.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.405
<i>Nature, that's my god.</i>

07:39.042 --> 07:41.534
<i>I suppose
we'll have to agree to disagree.</i>

07:43.171 --> 07:44.503
I have an angel.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.544
<i>Don't matter.</i>

07:47.759 --> 07:53.175
Even if you believe he puts us here,
it's nature that takes us away.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.089
The beasts and the bugs.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.766
The vultures and the nitrogen.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.437
Beautiful process.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.225
The basis of life itself, really.

08:06.403 --> 08:07.439
Without death...

08:08.405 --> 08:10.317
...there is no life.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.367
- Aren't you curious?
- Not even slightly.

08:18.540 --> 08:22.830
Agent Navabi. I need you to tell me what
you know about the man who took her.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.794
Over the years, people have
stumbled onto New Haven.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.629
A couple who were hiking.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.426
A hunter or two.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.587
Even an ex of one of our elders.

08:36.265 --> 08:40.351
Steven is a man I contact
to get rid of their remains.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.554
Steven who? What is his last name?

08:42.772 --> 08:44.434
Feltmeyer.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.896
- It's fake. I don't know his real name.
- Do you know where he is?

08:48.278 --> 08:54.149
All I know is who I call
if I need to hire Feltmeyer for a job.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.865
I'm sorry. They're getting a little impatient.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.831
The problem, you know, isn't so much
their hunger as their teeth.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.203
And why is that?

09:07.422 --> 09:10.005
These are Himalayan field rats.

09:10.175 --> 09:14.294
They have 12 molars each,
and their teeth just keep growing.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.838
Five inches a year,
if you can believe that.

09:17.015 --> 09:20.008
That's why they need
something substantial to chew on...

09:20.185 --> 09:22.222
...to wear down those teeth.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.183
- And that's me today.
- Yeah, that's you.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.227
Damn it!

09:41.873 --> 09:43.239
Stop.

09:50.757 --> 09:54.967
You're absolutely right, Harold.
It is not a weasel. It's a badger.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.674
She's a digger.
She'll go after insects and grubs.

09:57.889 --> 10:01.303
But she really goes nuts
for ground-nesting birds.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.469
- Our prisoner is not a ground-nesting bird.
- He is to Bernice.

10:04.729 --> 10:08.143
Harold, understand.
Bernice is a seasoned professional.

10:08.316 --> 10:12.276
Recently retired after years
in the film and television industries...

10:12.445 --> 10:16.064
...where she had a prolific career
playing a list of heavies.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.654
She's worked
with Eli Wallach, Faye Dunaway.

10:18.827 --> 10:21.695
- Did two pictures with George Kennedy?
- She did.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.488
But don't be fooled by
her offscreen persona.

10:24.666 --> 10:28.205
She is an absolute devil
who has never missed her mark...

10:28.378 --> 10:31.212
...and will perform
whatever the scene calls for.

10:31.381 --> 10:34.124
Ten minutes
with Bernice and Brimley...

10:34.300 --> 10:37.134
...and your prisoner will give
the name of Samar's abductor.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.137
- He already has.
- You got him to talk. How?

10:40.306 --> 10:43.094
With all due respect, sir,
all that matters is that I did.

10:43.268 --> 10:46.306
Turns out Moore goes through
a third party to make contact.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.517
- A guy by the name of Hannelore.
- Julius Hannelore?

10:49.691 --> 10:51.978
- Do you know him?
- He's a broker of sorts.

10:52.193 --> 10:56.813
An associate recommended him to me
after Mr. Kaplan passed.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.899
She did not "pass." She killed herself...

11:00.201 --> 11:04.366
...so I could get the duffel bag. It was
her dying wish. Feel free to honor it.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.665
- Can you reach out to your associate?
- On my way.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.700
I'm going in case you plan on juggling.

11:09.878 --> 11:13.997
Listen, if my bringing Teddy here
suggests a new open-door policy...

11:14.174 --> 11:18.168
...let me set the record straight.
My associates are just that, mine.

11:18.386 --> 11:22.221
And unless otherwise indicated,
my meetings with them are private.

11:22.390 --> 11:26.851
Then Agent Keen will be outside so
you can relay any pertinent information.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.561
Stop!

11:31.107 --> 11:34.441
Look, lady, there's not
much point in running.

11:34.611 --> 11:40.152
I told you I don't like this. But I have
a gun, and I will use it if you make me.

11:41.242 --> 11:44.235
I was nice to you, and you did this.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.911
Get up.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.578
Walk.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.668
Julius.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.052
How do you do it?

12:02.347 --> 12:05.431
How do you make a person
more presentable in death...

12:05.600 --> 12:08.718
- ...than they were in life?
- Family recipe.

12:09.312 --> 12:13.852
Formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde,
humectants, dye, water...

12:14.067 --> 12:17.185
...and a secret sauce
three generations in the making.

12:17.362 --> 12:20.776
Plus the occasional cotton ball.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.070
Mr. Sulzberger is an open casket.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.453
Viewing's in an hour.
So unless it's urgent...

12:27.705 --> 12:30.118
I'm looking for Steven Feltmeyer.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.207
I can reach out.

12:32.377 --> 12:35.211
- Broker an arrangement.
- This is a pressing matter.

12:35.380 --> 12:40.296
- I don't have time to go through channels.
- The channels are the channels.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.882
Everything in its time
and mackerel in August.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.259
I'm going to need my mackerel now.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.808
Or the Sulzbergers
are going to need to close the casket.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.014
You wouldn't.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.395
I'd sooner take a knife
to the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

12:53.564 --> 12:56.853
But Feltmeyer has an associate
of mine, and I'd like her back.

12:57.026 --> 13:00.064
Preferably before she needs
her lips sewn shut.

13:20.842 --> 13:23.209
<i>Feltmeyer's real name
is Lawrence Devlin.</i>

13:23.386 --> 13:26.629
I'll work up a profile to present
as soon as I get back.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.381
Good luck with that.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.050
Where can we drop you?

13:31.227 --> 13:32.718
Wait.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.098
You're leaving?

13:34.272 --> 13:36.389
We still don't have Samar.

13:36.566 --> 13:40.936
If there was more I could contribute,
I would do it gladly.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.811
But there isn't.

13:42.989 --> 13:47.074
- So, yes, I'm leaving.
- Knowing that I can't come with you.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.951
My thoughts and prayers will be
with you in your search.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.827
- I hope that provides some consolation.
- Yeah, I'm sure you do.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.118
Okay, here's what we're gonna do:
we're gonna take you to the farm.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.921
I'm gonna hold you down,
and make one real clean incision...

14:01.132 --> 14:03.124
...in your lower lumbar vertebra.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.801
I'm gonna sever your spinal cord
to immobilize you.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.212
Then we're gonna
let the rats have their way.

14:08.431 --> 14:12.095
And that's just the way it is
because of what you did. Get in.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.514
No, no. Don't.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.096
Get in.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.072
<i>According to Reddington's source...</i>

14:28.242 --> 14:31.280
...Feltmeyer's real name
is Lawrence Dane Devlin.

14:31.454 --> 14:35.494
Devlin is a fixer who specializes
in making problems go away.

14:35.708 --> 14:39.577
Apparently, Devlin's disposal methods
have a scientific flair.

14:39.754 --> 14:43.247
- He considers himself a thanatologist.
- I don't know what that is.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.550
The scientific discipline devoted
to the study of death and decay.

14:46.761 --> 14:49.845
As recent as 2005,
Devlin held a research position...

14:50.014 --> 14:52.552
...at the University of Tennessee's
body farm...

14:52.767 --> 14:54.679
...until he came under investigation.

14:54.852 --> 14:58.311
Apparently several of the cadavers
Devlin requisitioned...

14:58.689 --> 15:01.147
...turned out to have missing limbs
and body parts.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.603
Were charges filed?

15:02.819 --> 15:06.108
Yes, but Devlin and all three witnesses
vanished without a trace.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.819
Since that time, Devlin's been
in the body-disposal business.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.866
While performing experiments.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.446
Which means there are victims
we can chase down as leads.

15:15.665 --> 15:19.579
The list of potential victims
goes on and on and on.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.452
But they're exactly that...

15:21.629 --> 15:25.999
...victims in unsolved crimes
who were never found or recovered.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.541
And this guy has Samar.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.085
Sir, we have a situation.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.223
He just collapsed.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.883
Call an ambulance.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.066
It's getting harder for you to breathe
because your lungs...

15:52.243 --> 15:54.451
...are slowly filling up with blood.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.280
Without a doctor, you'll be starved
of oxygen until you'll be...

15:58.458 --> 16:00.620
...forced to aspirate on your own blood.

16:00.835 --> 16:05.375
But on the bright side,
it's an entirely natural way to go.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.172
Likely what God intended for you.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.298
Hey. Hey.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.425
Pull over. You can't drive. Hey.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.257
Pull over.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.709
This is what you need to get in.

16:44.962 --> 16:48.546
I pinched a couple off the drivers
I snorkled tequila with.

16:49.008 --> 16:54.595
F-Y's-I, we're going out for another round
later. So don't shoot them or anything.

16:54.764 --> 16:55.880
Mercury dime.

16:56.098 --> 17:00.012
Or more accurately, Winged Liberty.
Here's a fun fact:

17:00.228 --> 17:03.141
The image was modeled
on Elsie Stevens...

17:03.356 --> 17:05.564
...the wife of poet Wallace Stevens.

17:05.900 --> 17:10.691
<i>For the listener, who listens in the snow
And, nothing himself, beholds</i>

17:10.905 --> 17:14.740
<i>Nothing that is not there
and the nothing that is.</i>

17:15.701 --> 17:19.866
All right, ladies and gentlemen. Our next
item for bid is this magnificent beast.

17:20.039 --> 17:24.579
Lot number 16. An item any
climate change denier will love.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.711
- This polar bear would make...
- It's not on the list.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.872
Maybe it's not for sale.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.631
Or maybe it already sold.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.419
Do I have 50,000? Fifty-thousand is bid.
Looking for 55.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.174
Fifty-five thousand. New bidder.

17:37.348 --> 17:41.262
"The final item won't be revealed
until just prior to the start of bidding."

17:41.435 --> 17:44.269
- Maybe that's the duffel.
- There may be time.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.556
Excuse me. The person in charge,
where might they be?

17:47.733 --> 17:49.770
Is there any advance over $70,000?

17:50.194 --> 17:51.856
Sold.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.986
Tell him it's Raymond Reddington.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.773
Mr. Gonzalez doesn't see customers.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.781
Please, just tell him
it's Raymond Reddington.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.453
I've heard steroids
make your penis shrink.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.168
Have you found that to be the case?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.341
The answer's no.

18:18.723 --> 18:21.716
He knows I'm number one
on the wanted list, right?

18:21.892 --> 18:25.260
He does. He told me to tell you
the last number one is his driver.

18:25.479 --> 18:28.347
Oh, I mean, obviously, he's joking.

18:28.566 --> 18:32.185
He's not much for jokes.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.397
Move along.

18:34.405 --> 18:37.398
Of course. If you could
direct me to the bathroom.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.192
They got metal detectors, wands...

18:40.411 --> 18:44.451
With a guest list that's a who's who of
scumbags, they ain't taking chances.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.282
No one gets a piece in
once the party starts.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.996
What about before it starts?

18:49.337 --> 18:53.627
After our night on the town,
the drivers were so bent...

18:53.799 --> 18:56.041
...they needed help
off-loading some goodies.

18:56.427 --> 18:59.886
I found a bathroom on the first floor.
Look under the sink.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.624
Moving on. Lot number 17.

19:29.794 --> 19:33.538
An Assyrian relief from Nimrud
dating from the 7th century BCE.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.581
Plunder of the Islamic State.

19:36.759 --> 19:42.300
They insist the antiquity of the idolatry
the Quran demands be destroyed.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.465
Or sold at auction.

19:44.642 --> 19:47.760
The sale of illegal artifacts
is a major source...

19:47.937 --> 19:53.683
...of funding for terrorism in the Middle
East. But for Muslims, this is our history.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.067
A link to our past.

19:56.237 --> 19:58.729
What they are doing
is like cultural genocide.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.440
It's two bidders, 750. Thank you, sir.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.075
The bid is with you at 750.
Looking for 800.

20:04.245 --> 20:07.033
But this is a problem for another day.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.955
Maybe.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.789
- Maybe not.
- Any advance over 800? 850, sir?

20:13.170 --> 20:15.958
Is 850 bid?
Eight hundred fifty thousand.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.465
The bid is at $850,000.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.421
Looking for 900.

20:20.594 --> 20:25.089
I genuinely don't want this
to become unpleasant.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.386
Mr. Gonzalez said no.

20:29.311 --> 20:33.021
You know, it's awful,
but people do tend to associate...

20:33.190 --> 20:35.603
...a thick neck with a low IQ.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.610
How about shattering that clichÃ©...

20:38.779 --> 20:42.489
...by reasonably persuading him
to change his mind?

20:42.783 --> 20:44.240
That's not gonna happen.

20:44.577 --> 20:48.161
And we're at $1.7 million.
Do I have 1.7? Thank you, sir.

20:48.372 --> 20:51.240
One point seven, I have.
Looking for 1.8.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.501
Looking for 1.8 million.
I have 1.8 million. Thank you.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.037
- Point of order.
- Sorry. Are you bidding?

20:57.256 --> 21:00.169
Does it bother either of you,
the terrorism of it all?

21:00.342 --> 21:03.255
- I'm gonna have to ask you to sit.
- Either of you? No?

21:03.429 --> 21:05.637
Good. That makes this so much easier.

21:12.688 --> 21:16.181
- Come with me.
- Ah, I thought you'd never ask.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.900
- We may have something.
- An address on Devlin.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.026
He has a farm in Preston County.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.195
Nicholas Moore is dead.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.366
Toxicology believes
he took his own life.

21:26.577 --> 21:30.696
Had a cyanide pill in his Bible which
had been processed into evidence.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.739
Any idea how he may have gotten it?

21:34.126 --> 21:35.207
I got it for him.

21:36.587 --> 21:40.171
That's how I got him to talk.
He said he'd help find Samar...

21:40.341 --> 21:42.799
...if I stole it for him. And so I did.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.172
I'll accept whatever punishment
is appropriate.

21:45.346 --> 21:49.056
But it got us a name and now
a location where Samar may be.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.684
- You've run the address?
- Not only that. I found a phone registered...

21:52.853 --> 21:56.563
...under one of Devlin's known aliases
registered to that same farm.

21:59.902 --> 22:04.272
The HLR, the Home Location Register,
is updated every time a phone's SIM...

22:04.448 --> 22:06.906
...is transferred
into another location area.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.781
According to the HLR, that phone
was in Grafton County two days ago.

22:10.996 --> 22:14.489
- The hospital where Samar was abducted.
- Can you triangulate its location?

22:21.590 --> 22:24.754
Devlin must be in the middle of nowhere.
He's pinging off one tower.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.793
- Can't triangulate it.
- Not off one tower.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.345
They could be anywhere
within a 45-mile radius.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.389
Not far from his farm.
Maybe he took her there.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.841
If she isn't already dead.

22:33.018 --> 22:37.012
Issue a bulletin. I want all
resources redeployed to West Virginia.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.869
<i>- Leave a message.</i>
- Lawrence Devlin.

23:01.171 --> 23:04.790
<i>This is Special Agent
Aram Mojtabai of the FBI.</i>

23:05.009 --> 23:07.171
We know you have Agent Navabi.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.385
<i>We know where you live.</i>

23:09.847 --> 23:11.588
<i>And we will find you.</i>

23:11.807 --> 23:14.220
And when we do, Samar...

23:15.436 --> 23:17.553
Agent Navabi better be alive.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.806
<i>You may not be aware of this...</i>

23:22.026 --> 23:26.521
...but taking the life of a federal officer
is a capital crime punishable by death.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.814
<i>So if she's...</i>

23:31.076 --> 23:33.033
If you kill her...

23:33.329 --> 23:35.366
...we will kill you.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.583
Where are you going?

23:41.420 --> 23:43.833
You said I should go get a doctor.

23:44.006 --> 23:47.499
So I'm gonna go get myself one.
You, I'm not so sure about.

23:47.718 --> 23:50.210
I suspect you're gonna die here.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.229
- I'll get the house.
- I have the shed.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.492
Stop! Stop!

24:18.666 --> 24:20.498
Stop! I said stop.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.204
I said stop.

24:23.629 --> 24:24.870
Samar, where is she?

24:25.089 --> 24:27.752
Agent Navabi. Lawrence Devlin.
Where'd he take her?

24:27.967 --> 24:29.754
Where'd he take her?

24:33.222 --> 24:36.056
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't have you shot.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.132
How about 4 million?

24:38.352 --> 24:40.594
For the Assyrian relief.

24:40.771 --> 24:44.355
More than twice what
your two highest bidders were offering.

24:44.566 --> 24:47.855
Not how this works. You don't shoot
your way to the front of the line.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.232
You bid your way to it.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.564
I'd respect that,
but I'm pressed for time...

24:52.741 --> 24:58.408
...something a smart businessman such
as yourself should take full advantage of.

24:58.706 --> 25:01.494
- Five million.
- Surely you can do better than that.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.709
- Six million.
- Done. On two conditions:

25:04.878 --> 25:07.461
First, you keep the proceeds.
Terrorists get nothing.

25:07.881 --> 25:12.296
Tell them the shipment was lost,
or stolen, or intercepted by customs.

25:12.469 --> 25:15.337
I'll find a more appropriate
home for the relief.

25:15.681 --> 25:16.842
And the second?

25:18.350 --> 25:20.012
I get the duffel bag.

25:20.227 --> 25:21.468
What duffel bag?

25:22.187 --> 25:23.553
The final item.

25:23.772 --> 25:28.107
Are schematics to Samsung's
next Android operating system.

25:28.944 --> 25:32.483
Ian Garvey came here.
He brought you a duffel bag.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.815
I have no duffel bag.

25:34.992 --> 25:38.156
And I've never met Ian Garvey.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.199
But... But he was here.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.988
Not to meet with me.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.333
Then I have a third condition.

25:46.503 --> 25:49.291
I want to see your surveillance footage.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.998
This isn't true or false.
We know you work for Devlin.

25:52.176 --> 25:55.089
- I don't know where he is.
- You know how to get ahold of him.

25:55.262 --> 25:58.972
No. I'm telling you
I don't anything about your friend.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.262
I just manage the property.

26:01.477 --> 26:05.187
Devlin lets me stay here.
In exchange, I take care of the stock.

26:05.355 --> 26:08.189
"The stock"?
The insects you keep in the shed?

26:08.358 --> 26:11.226
Insects, rodents...

26:12.112 --> 26:13.273
...arthropods.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.396
They need a lot of care.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.531
So, what are the insects for?

26:19.203 --> 26:23.163
Okay, okay, Mr. Hull,
I need to be clear with you.

26:23.332 --> 26:25.699
The FBI is gonna find
Lawrence Devlin.

26:25.876 --> 26:29.085
When they do, they'll prosecute him
to the fullest extent of the law.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.667
When that happens,
you will be an accessory.

26:31.840 --> 26:36.050
Now, whatever you know,
however you can help...

26:37.096 --> 26:42.308
...will be taken into consideration
when charges are brought against you...

26:42.976 --> 26:44.217
...which will happen.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.351
He does experiments...

26:51.068 --> 26:52.980
...with the bodies.

26:53.821 --> 26:55.483
That's what the arthropods are for.

26:55.656 --> 26:59.445
Studying decomposition
under various settings.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.281
You know where he does this?

27:03.956 --> 27:05.492
He calls it "The Lab."

27:06.708 --> 27:09.166
It's on his grandfather's land...

27:09.336 --> 27:12.249
...in Taylor... Taylor County.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.259
Let me in!

28:53.774 --> 28:55.436
I got something over here.

28:56.485 --> 28:58.192
What is it?

29:04.952 --> 29:06.363
It's a body.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.696
What? What body?
What do you mean, "a body"?

29:09.873 --> 29:12.456
It's old. It's not Samar.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.202
This guy's serious.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.959
I don't understand.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.833
How did nobody know
this was out here?

29:22.010 --> 29:24.969
Question is,
"How far does this place go?"

29:30.852 --> 29:33.686
This is from last month's auction.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.355
Yeah.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.311
That man. There.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.696
He's a valued customer.

29:47.077 --> 29:49.069
I know him as Max Birmingham.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.206
What his real name is, I cannot say.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.199
I can.

30:25.615 --> 30:27.231
Oh, God.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.860
- I think I have something.
<i>- What is it?</i>

30:31.621 --> 30:33.908
<i>- Aram, talk to us.
- What do you have?</i>

30:34.124 --> 30:35.740
<i>- Aram.</i>
- No, no.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.291
- No.
<i>- What is it?</i>

30:41.965 --> 30:43.797
- Hello?
- Aram.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.209
Samar?

30:46.428 --> 30:48.215
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

30:48.513 --> 30:49.845
There was an accident.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.549
An accident. Are you hurt?
Where are you?

30:53.143 --> 30:55.305
- The van, it's in the water.
<i>- Water, okay.</i>

30:55.520 --> 30:59.730
What water? Listen, I think we're close,
just tell me where you are.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.899
Samar?

31:02.194 --> 31:03.810
Come on, Samar. Talk to me.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.819
Lawrence Devlin,
the man who took you.

31:05.989 --> 31:08.823
<i>He's dead. There was...
There was a bear.</i>

31:08.992 --> 31:10.574
A bear.

31:10.994 --> 31:12.485
As in a bear?

31:12.704 --> 31:14.787
<i>Okay, listen, now the water.</i>

31:14.998 --> 31:17.240
Is it a lake or a river?

31:18.085 --> 31:20.202
- Yes.
<i>- Yes. Yes.</i>

31:20.420 --> 31:22.082
It's a lake or a river.

31:24.925 --> 31:28.134
If you had asked me
to marry you, my love...

31:29.262 --> 31:31.720
...the answer would've been "yes."

31:36.228 --> 31:37.890
That's...

31:38.897 --> 31:40.513
I...

31:42.984 --> 31:44.600
Samar...

31:44.903 --> 31:45.939
...listen to me.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.192
<i>All that matters
is getting you home safely.</i>

31:49.366 --> 31:51.699
<i>So please just tell me where you are.</i>

31:52.702 --> 31:55.194
Tell me where you are, Samar.
Come on.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.075
<i>Come on. Samar.</i>

31:57.249 --> 31:59.286
<i>Samar, come on.</i>

32:01.044 --> 32:03.707
There was an accident and water.
The van was in water.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.213
The only water nearby
is the Tygart Valley River.

32:06.383 --> 32:09.046
- It runs for miles.
- We don't have to look for all of it.

32:09.219 --> 32:12.462
When I ran a search
for Devlin's cell, it only pinged...

32:12.639 --> 32:15.973
...one tower in the region.
Yeah, here, outside Kingwood.

32:16.143 --> 32:19.261
That limits us to four or five
square miles of river.

32:19.813 --> 32:22.430
- She said there was a bear.
- We have to get moving.

32:22.774 --> 32:28.566
Listen up. We're gonna refocus our search
to a five-mile area along the Tygart River.

32:48.341 --> 32:50.207
Where are you?

33:21.917 --> 33:25.206
Guys. Guys, I found it.
I think I see the van.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.629
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Don't know. I turned north off Kannan.

33:28.798 --> 33:30.881
Less than a quarter mile.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.632
Samar. Samar!

33:39.559 --> 33:41.095
<i>Hold on. We're on our way.</i>

33:41.269 --> 33:44.808
<i>A medevac is en route.
They're looking for a place to land.</i>

33:56.576 --> 33:57.737
Okay.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.655
Hang on. Hang on.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.376
Hang on.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.088
Hang... Hang on.

34:28.775 --> 34:29.891
Come on!

35:00.265 --> 35:02.382
Come on. Come on, Samar.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.967
Come on.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.978
Come on. Come on!

35:30.545 --> 35:35.381
You mind telling me who this...
This Max Birmingham really is?

35:35.842 --> 35:38.129
Sutton Ross.

35:38.345 --> 35:40.632
He died years ago.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.429
Or so I thought.

35:42.641 --> 35:45.679
- That's his connection to Garvey.
- What is?

35:46.436 --> 35:50.521
Garvey was a U.S. Marshal.
He put people in witness protection.

35:50.690 --> 35:53.808
Made them disappear
or appear to be dead.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.898
Garvey must've made that happen
for Sutton Ross.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.691
I came all this way to find...

36:01.868 --> 36:05.828
...the duffel has been handed
from one enemy of mine to another.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.535
And yet neither chose
to make its contents public.

36:08.708 --> 36:13.794
If what you're looking for is so valuable,
why didn't they put it up for auction?

36:15.382 --> 36:17.749
I have no idea.

36:20.970 --> 36:24.429
So I did a little research.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.886
I know. I know. Pathetic, right?

36:27.060 --> 36:29.598
And yet... Hang on.

36:29.771 --> 36:32.889
Maybe... Maybe not so pathetic.

36:33.191 --> 36:37.526
Okay. So I came across
this study from 2014...

36:37.737 --> 36:41.606
...that showed how playing
familiar music to people in...

36:41.783 --> 36:45.652
In minimally conscious states
enhanced recovery.

36:46.287 --> 36:51.078
They found that certain audio cues
improved cerebral plasticity...

36:51.251 --> 36:54.744
...and helped them recover.

36:55.130 --> 36:59.841
So since, at the moment,
you can't get to your favorite playlist...

37:00.510 --> 37:03.127
...I thought that I...

37:03.471 --> 37:07.055
...would bring
your favorite playlist to you.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.793
How is she?

37:37.088 --> 37:38.295
She's alive.

37:38.465 --> 37:41.458
But she went a long time
without oxygen.

37:41.634 --> 37:44.968
That was after
she was somehow impaled.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.388
Did they say how long
she would be on a respirator?

37:48.558 --> 37:53.519
They said she can't breathe on her own,
and they don't know if she ever will.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.560
How's he doing?

37:58.026 --> 38:00.985
How would any of us be doing
if we were him?

38:02.697 --> 38:03.904
Where's Keen?

38:07.660 --> 38:10.152
Agent Elizabeth Keen, FBI.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.798
I spoke to Harold.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.758
He told me about Agent Navabi.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.590
Gonzalez called you.

38:31.851 --> 38:33.262
His guard, actually.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.769
We developed something of a bond.

38:36.064 --> 38:39.102
He showed me the surveillance feeds.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.858
I know Max Birmingham
has the duffel bag.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.024
You follow me
to where you don't belong...

38:45.198 --> 38:48.066
...watch tapes
that are none of your business.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.150
I sent his picture to the Post Office.

38:50.370 --> 38:53.033
You do what you know
I don't want you to do.

38:53.248 --> 38:56.412
By the time I get back,
they'll have his real ID.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.125
You disappoint me.

38:59.963 --> 39:04.924
And yet somehow,
at the same time, you impress me.

39:06.886 --> 39:07.967
You persevere.

39:09.639 --> 39:11.301
Runs in the family, I guess.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.306
I suppose it was inevitable.

39:17.647 --> 39:20.685
- What's that?
- Our sprint to the finish.

39:20.859 --> 39:23.351
The bag is just out of reach now.

39:23.570 --> 39:27.063
After everything we've been through,
won't be long before one of us has it.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.197
Not "one of us."

39:29.951 --> 39:31.658
Me.

39:33.872 --> 39:37.161
What would you say
to flying back with me on my jet?

39:37.375 --> 39:40.664
Enjoying a few hours
of peace and quiet...

39:40.837 --> 39:45.298
...before we repair
to our neutral corners?

39:45.633 --> 39:48.501
I'd say that's a very generous offer.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.804
Yes, it would be if I was to offer that.

39:54.267 --> 39:56.054
Which I'm not.

39:56.561 --> 39:57.677
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

39:58.313 --> 40:01.021
I'll be waiting at the finish line.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.190
Okay, so...

40:11.367 --> 40:14.201
...this one wasn't on your playlist.

40:14.454 --> 40:18.289
Or mine, but I'm kind of hoping
that someday...

40:19.250 --> 40:21.207
...it will be.

40:51.658 --> 40:53.274
Samar.

40:56.245 --> 41:00.034
I've been in love with you
since the first moment I saw you.

41:01.209 --> 41:04.247
Every day since then has...

41:05.880 --> 41:09.624
Has been my best day
because I have spent them with you.

41:13.346 --> 41:16.965
I want to spend all my days with you.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.554
So...

41:27.235 --> 41:28.771
Here we go.

41:32.907 --> 41:35.115
Samar Navabi...

41:36.494 --> 41:38.952
...at long last...

41:42.750 --> 41:44.742
...will you marry me?
