02:00.970 --> 02:03.943
- You remember the place
when you were a child.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.923
That place no on else could inhabit.

02:09.210 --> 02:11.242
It was all yours.

02:12.830 --> 02:14.373
This is my place,

02:15.350 --> 02:16.516
my dream,

02:17.890 --> 02:19.053
my nightmare.

02:21.600 --> 02:25.047
But of the darkest, most dangerous paths,

02:27.360 --> 02:28.871
we are born anew.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.065
But there is no future without sacrifice.

02:38.860 --> 02:41.460
Sometimes,

02:41.510 --> 02:44.130
we must die in order to live.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.643
- You're a very demure girl, Dulcina.

05:09.540 --> 05:10.973
Very controlled.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.093
You remind me of a closed flower.

05:18.301 --> 05:19.588
A rose bud.

05:34.330 --> 05:36.910
I hear you make all your own clothes.

05:36.960 --> 05:37.793
Is that right?

05:40.880 --> 05:41.713
- Yes.

05:44.560 --> 05:47.310
- Well, have you ever thought
about going into fashion?

05:48.900 --> 05:49.733
- Fashion?

05:51.380 --> 05:52.213
No.

05:53.510 --> 05:55.823
- You're not proud of your talent?

05:58.640 --> 05:59.890
- Whatever talent I've been given,

05:59.940 --> 06:02.023
I've been given by the grace of God.

06:14.790 --> 06:15.840
Where'd you get this?

06:20.710 --> 06:22.610
- It was here when I rented the place.

06:24.920 --> 06:25.753
- It's red.

06:27.690 --> 06:29.063
- The color of passion.

06:36.660 --> 06:37.590
- Or despair.

06:43.610 --> 06:44.443
- Shh.

06:49.898 --> 06:51.731
Do not antagonize her.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.122
- Dulcina,

06:56.360 --> 06:59.190
have you had suicidal thoughts
since you've been here?

06:59.240 --> 07:00.710
- No.
- I need to know.

07:00.760 --> 07:01.593
- No.

07:03.270 --> 07:04.683
I told you I never did.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.143
I sleep walk.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.900
- You know you can
speak your mind in here.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.563
No one is judging you.

07:19.590 --> 07:20.893
- God is judging me.

07:24.140 --> 07:25.307
He's watching us all.

07:26.480 --> 07:30.089
- My savior will tell me
what should be done with you.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.343
- What could you think he's
possibly judging you for?

07:39.935 --> 07:40.768
- My sins.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.510
My mother died when I was nine years old.

07:50.772 --> 07:52.185
I want to go to church.

07:52.235 --> 07:53.660
All the other kids

07:53.710 --> 07:55.473
went to the same Baptist church.

07:56.580 --> 07:57.753
I was an outcast.

08:04.220 --> 08:06.970
And, you know, I was an outcast.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.113
- I'd like to try some hypnosis.

08:12.330 --> 08:14.920
Would that be all right with you, Dulcina?

08:14.970 --> 08:16.130
- Okay.
- Great.

08:26.520 --> 08:27.933
So I'm going to count.

08:29.820 --> 08:34.363
Lie down, close your eyes.

08:37.290 --> 08:40.243
One, two,

08:41.410 --> 08:46.410
three, four, five.

08:47.370 --> 08:49.183
See a beautiful place.

08:51.310 --> 08:52.283
What do you see?

08:53.630 --> 08:55.143
- I see the forest.

08:57.350 --> 08:59.500
I see the forest by my
grandmother's house.

09:01.365 --> 09:03.115
- What are you doing in the forest?

09:05.005 --> 09:06.303
- I'm walking.

09:09.475 --> 09:11.517
There are roses.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.983
There are red roses.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.240
- Now imagine that you're an eagle

09:21.155 --> 09:23.510
flying over the forest.

09:23.560 --> 09:27.641
That's it, Dulcina.

09:27.691 --> 09:28.524
Fly.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.870
Find something,

09:31.920 --> 09:34.542
find something there that you've lost.

09:35.988 --> 09:37.985
- Oh God, there's so much blood!

09:39.523 --> 09:40.523
He's coming! He's coming!

09:41.986 --> 09:43.333
He's coming for me!

09:44.890 --> 09:46.392
- You're waking up, Dulcina.

09:47.530 --> 09:49.360
Wake up, Dulcina!

09:49.410 --> 09:50.616
Wake!

10:00.070 --> 10:01.363
How do you feel now?

10:04.023 --> 10:06.131
- I don't feel real.

10:09.250 --> 10:10.857
I don't feel real.

10:18.275 --> 10:19.358
- It's real.

10:21.541 --> 10:23.768
You just aren't used to it.

10:23.818 --> 10:26.590
Don't be afraid of all
your feelings, Dulcina.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.080
I want you to know that you can dream

10:28.130 --> 10:29.973
and sleep and live without fear.

10:32.141 --> 10:33.830
To be good doesn't mean to deny ourselves

10:33.880 --> 10:34.873
who we really are.

10:35.947 --> 10:38.270
Go easier on yourself, sweetheart.

10:45.780 --> 10:47.948
- Life isn't a dream.

10:47.998 --> 10:49.248
- No, it isn't.

10:52.480 --> 10:56.303
But you can create your
life with your dreams.

11:03.660 --> 11:06.413
- I'm going to my grandmother's
house this winter.

11:09.130 --> 11:11.423
I'm gonna watch her house.

11:12.340 --> 11:13.420
It's a bookstore

11:14.553 --> 11:16.000
the rest of the year.

11:16.050 --> 11:16.883
- You are?

11:19.474 --> 11:21.403
Hmm. Nobody told me that.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.043
Well, okay.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.180
Certainly can't keep you here forever.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.600
Dulcina, you know that you need

11:35.650 --> 11:37.990
to check in with me once a week.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.620
- I know.
- Or anytime that you feel

11:39.670 --> 11:41.530
out of the ordinary

11:41.580 --> 11:43.410
or you wake up and you don't know

11:43.460 --> 11:45.350
how you've gotten to where you are.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.233
- I, I know.

11:48.183 --> 11:50.950
- You need to take your
medication every day.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.143
And then I'll see you
back here in a month.

12:27.463 --> 12:30.530
- Can I help you, miss?

12:30.580 --> 12:34.760
- I'm on the way to grandmother's house

12:34.810 --> 12:35.643
up the mountain.

12:36.740 --> 12:38.620
- I wouldn't recommend that.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.070
Storm's coming.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.430
If you go up there now, you won't be able

12:41.480 --> 12:43.330
to come back down till winter's over.

12:44.300 --> 12:47.170
There were three hikers
went up there last winter,

12:47.220 --> 12:49.330
they didn't find 'em till it thawed.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.823
They were unrecognizable.

12:52.490 --> 12:54.067
The animals had gotten to 'em.

12:55.123 --> 12:56.173
- I'll be fine.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.270
I go up every year.

13:00.303 --> 13:01.903
I'm okay.
- All right, hold on.

13:07.610 --> 13:10.753
You're gonna need this for firewood.

13:12.585 --> 13:13.757
Okay?

13:13.807 --> 13:14.640
And here.

13:25.170 --> 13:27.006
I'm gonna give you my number.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.683
All right. This is my card.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.290
That's my number.

13:33.140 --> 13:34.267
And that's my address.

13:34.317 --> 13:35.890
If you need anything,

13:35.940 --> 13:37.323
you give me a call.

13:38.690 --> 13:39.943
All right?
- Okay.

13:41.460 --> 13:43.157
- All right.
- Thank you.

13:43.207 --> 13:44.250
- You take care.

16:51.143 --> 16:53.910
"The Lord is my Shepard.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.940
Yea, though I walk through the valley

16:55.990 --> 16:57.263
of the shadow of death,

16:58.880 --> 17:00.118
I shall fear no evil."

17:13.480 --> 17:15.750
Dulcina, wake up!

17:15.800 --> 17:16.633
Wake up!

17:17.547 --> 17:18.930
Wake up, Dulcina!

18:17.403 --> 18:19.203
No one is judging you.

18:20.656 --> 18:22.720
God is judging me.

18:22.770 --> 18:24.063
He's watching us all.

18:24.942 --> 18:27.100
What
could you think he's possibly

18:27.150 --> 18:28.343
judging you for?

18:29.393 --> 18:30.973
- My sins.

18:59.436 --> 19:01.124
"Yea, though I walk through the valley

19:01.174 --> 19:03.091
of the shadow of death,

19:07.156 --> 19:08.989
I shall fear no evil."

22:30.767 --> 22:32.283
Grandma's Books.

22:35.090 --> 22:36.173
Hi, Grandma.

22:38.147 --> 22:39.233
No, I'm fine.

22:42.010 --> 22:43.983
No, the doctors said it was okay.

22:46.640 --> 22:47.553
Yes.

22:48.399 --> 22:52.263
Yes, Grandma, I'm checking in.

22:56.044 --> 22:58.950
I've, no, I've just had a few bad dreams.

22:59.000 --> 22:59.833
I'm fine.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.513
Please don't worry.

23:06.350 --> 23:07.453
I like it here.

23:09.649 --> 23:12.316
Bye.

24:10.518 --> 24:12.553
- She's dying inside! Don't you get it?

24:12.603 --> 24:13.841
So am I!
- She's not dying inside!

24:13.891 --> 24:15.457
She knows who I am!

24:15.507 --> 24:17.407
She knows who I am!
- Well I hold you-

24:17.457 --> 24:19.455
And she knows I'm not far away.

24:19.505 --> 24:21.074
I hope she doesn't know!

24:21.124 --> 24:22.796
- What,

24:22.846 --> 24:23.999
what does that-
- You're an animal!

24:24.049 --> 24:25.119
You don't care about God!
- Preach about God

24:25.169 --> 24:26.455
again to me!
- Get out of my house!

24:26.505 --> 24:28.586
- You're calling me some-
- Get out of my house!

24:28.636 --> 24:31.620
- You know what?
- Get out of my house!

24:31.670 --> 24:33.375
- Stop it, stop it!
- You can preach all you want!

24:33.425 --> 24:34.618
You've never been down...

25:14.688 --> 25:15.521
Shh.

25:18.774 --> 25:20.774
The wolf is at the door.

25:22.450 --> 25:24.723
He's always at the door.

25:25.930 --> 25:28.093
Every day of your life,

25:29.500 --> 25:30.333
waiting.

25:32.950 --> 25:33.783
Hungry.

25:35.850 --> 25:36.750
Do you understand?

25:38.310 --> 25:40.110
Well you better, okay?

25:40.160 --> 25:43.473
Death comes for every one of us,

25:45.000 --> 25:48.073
taking us into the dark
unknown wilderness.

25:49.820 --> 25:51.093
But that doesn't mean that
you have to wait for it

25:51.143 --> 25:53.163
like a lamb to slaughter.

25:56.278 --> 25:59.743
Fate favors the fighters.

26:02.271 --> 26:03.938
You are my daughter.

26:06.988 --> 26:08.821
Don't you forget that.

26:13.069 --> 26:14.569
I'm proud of you.

26:18.273 --> 26:21.410
I won't be here forever to protect you.

26:25.658 --> 26:27.663
I love you, Dulcina.

26:41.917 --> 26:42.834
I love you.

26:54.167 --> 26:56.651
- Daddy, Daddy! Don't go!

26:56.701 --> 26:58.220
Don't go! Don't leave me!

30:11.246 --> 30:13.345
The wolf is at the door.

32:43.152 --> 32:44.677
- Hello, this is Harlan.

32:44.727 --> 32:46.510
I can't come to the phone right now.

32:46.560 --> 32:47.712
Please leave a message.

32:48.870 --> 32:51.480
- Hi, this is Dulcina.

32:51.530 --> 32:54.158
You gave me your card and said

32:54.208 --> 32:57.833
if I needed you to give you a call.

32:59.040 --> 33:03.620
I've heard some noises
and, uh, I'm afraid.

33:03.670 --> 33:07.160
I just don't know.

33:07.210 --> 33:10.333
So, if you might stop by,

33:12.800 --> 33:13.883
I'd appreciate it.

33:14.930 --> 33:16.250
Thank you.
- There were three hikers

33:16.300 --> 33:17.380
went up there last winter,

33:17.430 --> 33:18.850
they were unrecognizable.

33:18.900 --> 33:20.050
The animals had gotten to 'em.

35:48.114 --> 35:49.697
Who are you?

35:50.700 --> 35:51.850
- I'm Sarah's neighbor.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.890
Sarah Ramadian, the owner of this house,

35:55.940 --> 35:58.550
she asked me to check in on the place.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.250
- She doesn't have any neighbors.

36:02.092 --> 36:04.020
There is nothing around here.

36:04.070 --> 36:06.003
Everything is closed for the winter.

36:07.090 --> 36:08.490
- Where did-
- I come from?

36:09.690 --> 36:10.943
I came from out there.

36:12.150 --> 36:13.799
The other side of the woods.

36:18.390 --> 36:19.473
- Well, I'm Dulcina.

36:21.590 --> 36:22.883
So if you know her,

36:24.370 --> 36:25.303
then you know me.

36:29.036 --> 36:31.684
- Dulcina's a little girl.

36:31.734 --> 36:32.517
- I'm not.

36:34.686 --> 36:35.797
I saw this boy.

36:40.740 --> 36:45.089
He had clear blue eyes.

36:51.665 --> 36:55.740
- It's just when she speaks you,

36:58.300 --> 37:00.543
she speaks of you as if you're a child.

37:07.333 --> 37:09.790
It's just that time...

37:09.840 --> 37:13.507
Time isn't friend of mine and I...

37:16.100 --> 37:18.510
I had in my mind

37:18.560 --> 37:20.330
that you were a little girl.

37:20.380 --> 37:21.763
- I am not a child.

37:24.590 --> 37:25.940
- You're all grown up then.

37:28.190 --> 37:30.353
I would put these away if I were you.

37:33.490 --> 37:35.133
Before you hurt yourself.

37:37.090 --> 37:37.923
- All right.

37:41.580 --> 37:42.523
Go to the front.

37:44.005 --> 37:45.105
I'll let you in there.

37:46.700 --> 37:47.743
- I have a key.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.980
And I'm Ulf, by the way

37:51.980 --> 37:54.793
- Well then go to the front, Ulf.

37:57.120 --> 37:59.513
Unless there's a reason
you are in my bedroom.

38:03.810 --> 38:04.643
Is there

38:08.550 --> 38:09.383
a reason?

38:11.890 --> 38:13.337
- I'll go to the front.

38:15.477 --> 38:16.323
- And knock.

38:20.660 --> 38:22.493
Like a civilized human being.

39:33.706 --> 39:35.234
- Sit up. All right?

39:35.284 --> 39:37.451
You're gonna faint again.

39:43.907 --> 39:44.690
- I'm not one of those,

39:44.740 --> 39:46.260
if that's what you're thinking.

39:47.270 --> 39:50.210
I cut the thorns off the roses.

39:50.260 --> 39:55.260
Sometimes the knife, it slips.

40:00.110 --> 40:01.532
- I knocked.

40:01.582 --> 40:04.135
You must have passed out, hit your head.

40:04.185 --> 40:05.552
- My grandmother didn't tell

40:05.602 --> 40:07.345
you would be stopping by.

40:07.395 --> 40:09.495
- She didn't tell me you'd be here either.

40:10.980 --> 40:13.380
- Well, I would call her
to see if you're lying,

40:14.672 --> 40:18.547
but the phone cord has been cut.

40:18.597 --> 40:20.647
Do you know how that might have happened?

40:21.685 --> 40:22.518
- No.

40:23.379 --> 40:24.483
- Well I didn't do it.

40:25.950 --> 40:27.813
And my grandmother didn't do it.

40:29.770 --> 40:32.693
You're the only other person
with a key to this house.

40:38.100 --> 40:40.961
- Animals, again with
these fucking animals!

40:41.011 --> 40:44.052
Look at this. It's fucking gone.

40:44.102 --> 40:46.273
Mm. It's been chewed straight through.

40:47.350 --> 40:49.080
She takes in these wild animals

40:49.130 --> 40:50.370
and she nurses them back to health

40:50.420 --> 40:52.600
and then this is the thanks she gets.

40:52.650 --> 40:53.800
She should know by now,

40:55.067 --> 40:56.623
a wild animal can't be tamed.

40:57.980 --> 40:59.200
You know, most people, they hurt

40:59.250 --> 41:01.300
or kill themselves with their own weapon.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.710
It's because they can't
go through with it.

41:07.868 --> 41:09.131
You need to wash this.

41:09.181 --> 41:11.376
Let me go!

41:11.426 --> 41:12.816
- We need to get you in bed.
- Let go of me!

41:12.866 --> 41:14.568
- You need your rest.
- Let go of me!

41:22.174 --> 41:23.415
It's all right.

41:51.730 --> 41:52.630
Fly.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.253
You're waking up, Dulcina.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.047
Wake up, Dulcina.

42:15.097 --> 42:16.707
Wake!

42:16.757 --> 42:19.070
Wake!

42:19.120 --> 42:20.808
Wake up, Dulcina!

42:24.640 --> 42:26.290
- I want you to know who you are.

42:27.910 --> 42:29.453
I want you to embrace it.

43:27.816 --> 43:29.420
My savior will tell me

43:29.470 --> 43:31.617
what should be done with you.

43:32.557 --> 43:36.102
And I will carry out his will.

46:57.117 --> 46:58.603
- The days will be dark soon.

47:00.990 --> 47:01.823
- Yes.

47:05.940 --> 47:08.680
- How do they grow? Your roses?

47:08.730 --> 47:09.693
There's no sun.

47:12.953 --> 47:13.883
- I don't know.

47:17.000 --> 47:17.863
They just do.

47:21.320 --> 47:23.643
I'm making some tea,

47:25.090 --> 47:26.040
if you'd like some.

47:28.030 --> 47:29.475
You're welcome to come in.

48:13.561 --> 48:14.644
Thank you for

48:17.065 --> 48:18.065
helping out.

48:20.676 --> 48:22.897
Winter's coming. I have to do it myself.

48:24.810 --> 48:25.643
Anyway,

48:27.730 --> 48:28.563
thank you.

48:33.225 --> 48:36.345
- You really don't remember
last night, do you?

48:36.395 --> 48:37.228
- Um, why?

48:39.262 --> 48:41.336
- You weren't well. I stayed.

48:51.495 --> 48:54.162
- I, I have trouble remembering.

48:57.745 --> 49:00.258
I forget things sometimes.

50:23.836 --> 50:26.419
- I brought you some kindling.

50:28.450 --> 50:29.680
I guess I'll get out of your hair

50:29.730 --> 50:31.880
and leave you to your books

50:33.220 --> 50:34.173
and your roses.

50:36.060 --> 50:37.840
You know you're awful young

50:37.890 --> 50:40.343
to be isolated out here all by yourself.

50:42.230 --> 50:43.063
- I prefer it.

50:46.890 --> 50:47.723
Being alone.

50:51.134 --> 50:52.301
- Yeah, right.

50:55.623 --> 50:56.456
I see.

51:03.729 --> 51:04.746
What happened?

51:09.970 --> 51:11.220
- I don't know.

51:12.783 --> 51:14.124
- Wake up, Dulcina!

52:22.246 --> 52:26.163
- I see the forest from
my grandmother's house.

52:36.938 --> 52:37.819
- Shh.
- My mother died

52:37.869 --> 52:39.280
when I was nine years old.

52:42.473 --> 52:44.010
Have you
had suicidal thoughts

52:44.060 --> 52:46.602
since you've been here, Dulcina?

52:46.652 --> 52:48.908
- I told you I never did.

52:48.958 --> 52:49.958
I sleepwalk.

52:56.608 --> 53:00.134
Walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

53:00.184 --> 53:01.934
I shall fear no evil.

56:38.755 --> 56:40.005
I saw this boy.

56:44.780 --> 56:48.563
He had clear blue eyes.

56:52.620 --> 56:54.137
And he said, "I see you.

56:58.799 --> 57:00.031
I see your soul."

58:14.444 --> 58:15.444
Who are you?

58:20.558 --> 58:22.058
- I'm your mirror.

58:26.464 --> 58:27.797
I'm the only one

58:29.752 --> 58:32.752
that understands your pain, Dulcina.

58:37.188 --> 58:40.590
That emptiness that you wanna rip out

58:40.640 --> 58:42.353
of your chest some nights.

58:43.410 --> 58:44.643
Even if it kills you.

58:48.928 --> 58:50.928
The eternal loneliness.

58:55.584 --> 58:59.585
We're the same.

58:59.635 --> 59:04.635
We were born with the same madness.

59:07.814 --> 59:11.814
Didn't you ever feel like
there was something...

59:13.211 --> 59:16.439
There was something out there
that could fill that void?

59:16.489 --> 59:17.322
- Yes.

59:19.613 --> 59:20.644
Yes.

59:42.030 --> 59:43.784
- What you reading?

59:46.825 --> 59:48.075
- It's a story.

59:51.719 --> 59:53.886
It's a story about a wolf.

59:57.724 --> 59:58.641
And a girl.

1:00:13.583 --> 1:00:16.740
Well the only story
I know like that is, ah...

1:00:16.790 --> 1:00:18.377
- This is a different story.

1:00:23.003 --> 1:00:24.477
I don't know how it ends yet.

1:00:29.835 --> 1:00:30.835
Hey.

1:00:33.710 --> 1:00:34.819
We already have.

1:00:37.170 --> 1:00:38.003
- I am...

1:00:43.908 --> 1:00:45.709
I'm a sinner.

1:00:53.270 --> 1:00:55.020
I don't deserve to live.

1:01:09.175 --> 1:01:10.508
There are roses.

1:01:11.897 --> 1:01:13.564
There are red roses.

1:02:42.570 --> 1:02:46.247
- My savior will tell me
what should be done with you.

1:02:47.217 --> 1:02:50.834
And I will carry out his will.

1:02:52.950 --> 1:02:53.783
- Daddy!

1:02:56.206 --> 1:02:57.039
Daddy!

1:03:02.580 --> 1:03:04.005
Help! Let me out!

1:03:04.055 --> 1:03:05.472
Please!
- Shut up,

1:03:06.570 --> 1:03:09.480
you horrible, wicked girl!

1:03:09.530 --> 1:03:12.153
I should kill you for what you've done!

1:03:15.542 --> 1:03:17.562
She's dying inside! Don't you get it?

1:03:17.612 --> 1:03:18.838
So am I!
- She's not dying inside!

1:03:18.888 --> 1:03:21.184
She knows who I am!

1:03:21.234 --> 1:03:22.387
She knows who I am!
- I hope she doesn't.

1:03:22.437 --> 1:03:24.610
- And she knows I'm not far away.

1:03:26.046 --> 1:03:27.494
- Shh.

1:03:57.648 --> 1:03:58.723
- He's coming!

1:03:58.773 --> 1:03:59.926
He's coming!

1:03:59.976 --> 1:04:01.283
He's coming for me!

1:04:01.333 --> 1:04:03.149
- I want you to know who you are.

1:04:05.740 --> 1:04:07.373
I want you to know who you are.

1:04:09.060 --> 1:04:10.553
I want you to embrace it.

1:04:21.316 --> 1:04:23.733
'Cause at the end of the day,

1:04:26.099 --> 1:04:28.516
fear is all we are left with.

1:04:46.861 --> 1:04:49.840
- You're waking up, Dulcina.

1:04:49.890 --> 1:04:51.778
Wake up, Dulcina.

1:04:51.828 --> 1:04:53.597
Wake! Wake!

1:06:09.576 --> 1:06:10.840
- You're an animal!

1:06:10.890 --> 1:06:12.340
We care about...
- No, go ahead!

1:06:12.390 --> 1:06:13.750
- You don't care about God!

1:06:32.985 --> 1:06:34.318
- You did this!

1:06:36.823 --> 1:06:38.833
- Domestication is a facade.

1:06:40.300 --> 1:06:41.343
It's a mask.

1:06:42.910 --> 1:06:45.253
Okay, we are animals.

1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:49.210
Perfection only exists in nature

1:06:49.260 --> 1:06:51.390
and all the books and all
the roses in the world

1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:53.473
are never gonna change that fact.

1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:57.670
We are here to rip it all apart

1:06:57.720 --> 1:06:59.830
and howl at the moon.

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:03.953
You, nice little girl,

1:07:06.340 --> 1:07:07.269
are a wolf.

1:07:38.233 --> 1:07:41.831
- You are not a wolf from
here anymore, Father!

1:07:43.972 --> 1:07:46.293
- Look at what has become of you two.

1:07:48.047 --> 1:07:51.736
I would have never raised
you children like this.

1:07:54.270 --> 1:07:56.503
I'd rather you be dead
that not being a wolf.

1:08:03.736 --> 1:08:05.986
- I am a true wolf, Father.

1:08:08.310 --> 1:08:10.175
Hunting in the night.

1:08:12.085 --> 1:08:13.752
Hunting in the dark.

1:08:15.430 --> 1:08:19.363
On the fringes of society
for long, long time.

1:08:20.350 --> 1:08:21.183
Banished.

1:08:22.250 --> 1:08:23.700
Lonely.

1:08:23.750 --> 1:08:25.050
Thinking of only this day.

1:08:26.887 --> 1:08:28.493
The day of retribution.

1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:34.940
The day I rip your beating
heart out of your chest

1:08:34.990 --> 1:08:37.124
for making me this way!

1:08:42.250 --> 1:08:43.225
- First,

1:08:45.870 --> 1:08:47.043
I will kill her.

1:08:48.512 --> 1:08:50.762
Your weak, precious sister.

1:08:57.788 --> 1:09:00.538
My boy, my boy, it's all for you.

1:09:02.532 --> 1:09:04.544
My little girl.

1:09:04.594 --> 1:09:06.601
I could see myself in your eyes.

1:09:09.378 --> 1:09:11.045
But you are no wolf!

1:09:24.570 --> 1:09:25.420
- Daddy!

1:09:25.470 --> 1:09:26.637
- Now you see?

1:09:28.056 --> 1:09:30.973
- I love you, Daddy.
- Now you know.

1:09:32.239 --> 1:09:33.072
- Daddy?

1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:35.063
Daddy?

1:09:37.659 --> 1:09:38.492
Daddy!

1:09:43.244 --> 1:09:44.994
- Our father is dead.

1:09:49.104 --> 1:09:50.579
Our father is dead.

1:09:56.898 --> 1:09:59.043
- Dulcina!

1:10:01.328 --> 1:10:02.111
Dulcina!

1:10:08.924 --> 1:10:10.021
Oh, God!

1:10:10.071 --> 1:10:10.904
Oh, God!

1:10:12.846 --> 1:10:13.679
Oh, God!

1:10:18.518 --> 1:10:22.285
What have you done to my sweet girl?

1:10:22.335 --> 1:10:23.918
What have you done?

1:10:25.529 --> 1:10:26.362
Oh, no.

1:10:28.488 --> 1:10:31.344
Wake up.

1:10:31.394 --> 1:10:33.561
Wake up, Dulcina. Wake...

1:10:33.611 --> 1:10:35.278
Oh, wake up. Please.

1:10:36.190 --> 1:10:37.172
Wake up.

1:10:40.442 --> 1:10:41.692
Babe, hi, baby.

1:10:45.028 --> 1:10:46.059
- Mommy.

1:10:46.109 --> 1:10:47.776
- Can, can you walk?

1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:51.782
- I can fly.

1:10:51.832 --> 1:10:53.532
- Oh, Mommy's gonna take you home.

1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:08.553
Have you ever
been to therapy, Carolyn?

1:11:13.340 --> 1:11:14.173
- No.

1:11:16.112 --> 1:11:18.283
I've never been labeled a psycho before.

1:11:21.010 --> 1:11:22.110
- You're not a psycho.

1:11:25.573 --> 1:11:27.323
Well you did try and hurt yourself.

1:11:28.860 --> 1:11:31.060
Your mother found you
on the bathroom floor.

1:11:35.460 --> 1:11:37.453
Why did you wanna hurt yourself, Carolyn?

1:11:40.033 --> 1:11:40.866
- Mm...

1:11:42.350 --> 1:11:43.250
- Why'd you do it?

1:11:45.230 --> 1:11:47.820
- Sometimes you have to
die in order to live.

1:11:52.390 --> 1:11:53.443
- I like your words,

1:11:55.690 --> 1:11:56.740
but I need the truth.

1:12:02.470 --> 1:12:04.004
- People are fucked up.

1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:07.640
I don't know.

1:12:09.931 --> 1:12:11.264
Human condition.

1:12:13.717 --> 1:12:16.090
We're programmed to want
something that we can never have.

1:12:16.140 --> 1:12:16.973
That we...

1:12:19.090 --> 1:12:20.760
We need something that we can never have

1:12:20.810 --> 1:12:22.060
from another human being.

1:12:25.496 --> 1:12:26.746
And then when you get it,

1:12:29.462 --> 1:12:30.545
for a moment,

1:12:32.747 --> 1:12:34.133
for a second,

1:12:36.090 --> 1:12:37.173
you connect.

1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:41.630
Then you're undone.

1:12:48.170 --> 1:12:49.263
My person is dead.

1:12:50.820 --> 1:12:52.193
What I accomplish,

1:12:56.210 --> 1:12:57.043
it will never,

1:12:59.770 --> 1:13:00.940
ever be anything

1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:06.055
compared to one second with him.

1:13:12.380 --> 1:13:14.473
People ask me why I killed myself.

1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:22.653
It's a stupid question.

1:13:25.660 --> 1:13:26.893
It's the wrong question.

1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:35.810
I just finished what was already started.

1:13:41.090 --> 1:13:42.140
I was still breathing

1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:49.053
but I was already dead.

1:13:54.880 --> 1:13:55.930
- So you're a writer?

1:13:58.810 --> 1:14:00.310
I hear you're writing fiction.

1:14:02.120 --> 1:14:04.453
Writing is a great way
to get over our past.

1:14:05.860 --> 1:14:08.493
To understand ourselves psychologically.

1:14:10.060 --> 1:14:12.467
To work it all out.

1:14:16.172 --> 1:14:17.755
- I'm not a writer.

1:14:21.147 --> 1:14:22.314
It's a diary.

1:14:24.550 --> 1:14:28.243
My memories, my memoirs.

1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:34.990
- I'm trying to help
you set yourself free.

1:14:36.170 --> 1:14:37.533
Like your character, Dulcina.

1:14:40.110 --> 1:14:41.313
- I can't be saved.

1:14:47.891 --> 1:14:49.224
I know who I am.

1:14:54.333 --> 1:14:55.750
I know what I am.

1:15:02.059 --> 1:15:03.142
I am Dulcina.

1:15:06.511 --> 1:15:08.011
And I am the wolf.

1:15:57.453 --> 1:15:58.286
- Daddy!

1:16:08.635 --> 1:16:09.468
Mother.

1:16:11.415 --> 1:16:12.356
Mother!

1:16:25.147 --> 1:16:26.147
I am cursed!

1:16:27.244 --> 1:16:29.799
You have cursed me, Father!

1:16:33.403 --> 1:16:34.236
Why?

1:16:37.213 --> 1:16:38.046
Why?

1:16:42.704 --> 1:16:43.537
What am I?

1:16:50.756 --> 1:16:52.339
What have I become?

1:16:58.139 --> 1:16:59.722
What have I become?

1:17:10.052 --> 1:17:11.839
I am the wolf.

1:17:11.889 --> 1:17:12.935
I am the wolf.
