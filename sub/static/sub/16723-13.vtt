LOUISE: <i>Click. Click.</i>
Click, click.

00:23.010 --> 00:24.177
- Louise, stop saying click.
- Click.

00:24.178 --> 00:25.411
Click.
And, Tina,

00:25.412 --> 00:26.880
will you stop typing like that?

00:26.914 --> 00:28.047
I'm refreshing my e-mail.

00:28.048 --> 00:30.155
I'm waiting for an invitation
to Tammy's Bat Mitzvah.

00:30.184 --> 00:31.918
I believe the term is badminton.

00:31.919 --> 00:32.919
Common mistake.

00:32.953 --> 00:34.454
No, Gene. Tammy's Jewish.

00:34.455 --> 00:36.289
It's a ceremony
where she reads from the Torah,

00:36.290 --> 00:37.824
lights a candle
and becomes a woman.

00:37.858 --> 00:40.059
Sounds like my spa night.
Except I read

00:40.060 --> 00:42.262
<i>The Girl with the Dragon
Tattoo.</i> (groans)

00:42.263 --> 00:45.198
You know a lot about Bat Mitzvahs
for someone who thought Chanukah

00:45.199 --> 00:47.214
was Han Solo and Chewbacca's baby.

00:47.234 --> 00:49.402
It's about becoming a woman
and it's a really great party.

00:49.403 --> 00:51.271
Why wouldn't I research that?

00:51.272 --> 00:54.012
Plus, rumor has it this one's
gonna be packed with B-FOS.

00:54.041 --> 00:55.263
What are B-FOS?

00:55.276 --> 00:57.143
B-F-O-S.
Boys From Other Schools.

00:57.178 --> 00:58.545
What's wrong with the boys
from your school?

00:58.546 --> 00:59.679
I need fresh faces.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.103
(quieter): And fresh butts.

01:01.115 --> 01:03.483
You'll take the butts you're
given and you'll like it!

01:03.517 --> 01:05.351
(school bell ringing)

01:05.352 --> 01:07.187
Don't you dare call back
until it's done!

01:07.188 --> 01:08.354
Do you understand me?

01:08.355 --> 01:09.956
Okay, bye, Mom.

01:09.957 --> 01:11.291
Hi, Tammy.
(groans)

01:11.292 --> 01:12.725
Tina, I am up to my pits

01:12.726 --> 01:14.527
in Bat Mitzvah planning.
Mm-hmm.

01:14.528 --> 01:18.064
But I figured out the
theme, which is "Tammy"!

01:18.065 --> 01:19.132
Me, it just makes sense.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.132
Nice.

01:20.134 --> 01:21.134
You get an "O" for original.

01:21.135 --> 01:23.903
And for O-M-G I didn't get an
invite to your Bat Mitzvah.

01:23.938 --> 01:26.072
Mm, that's 'cause
I didn't invite you.

01:26.073 --> 01:27.607
Oh. That "O" doesn't
stand for anything.

01:27.608 --> 01:29.309
It's just me being surprised.

01:29.310 --> 01:31.477
I was really looking
forward to all those B-FOS.

01:31.478 --> 01:33.746
Mm, me too.
Yeah, a lot of B-FOS.

01:33.747 --> 01:34.881
I got Hebrew School B-FOS.
Mm-hmm.

01:34.882 --> 01:35.949
Mm-hmm.
I got Camp B-FOS.

01:35.950 --> 01:37.383
I got B-FOS who are Filipinos.

01:37.418 --> 01:38.585
Fili-B-FOS.

01:38.619 --> 01:39.786
Got your invite, Tammy.

01:39.820 --> 01:41.921
We'll be there.
Bat Mitzvah, baby!

01:41.922 --> 01:43.323
Hava Nagiddiyup!
(laughs)

01:43.324 --> 01:44.457
Giddyap, boy!
Ow!

01:44.458 --> 01:46.159
Get! Giddyap!
Ow! (grunts)

01:46.160 --> 01:47.560
Ow!
Yeah!

01:47.561 --> 01:49.462
Well, if a spot opens up,
keep me in mind.

01:49.496 --> 01:50.830
Spots are for underwear, Tina.

01:50.831 --> 01:52.765
Not my Bat Mitzvah.
Got to run!

01:52.766 --> 01:54.567
(sighs)

01:54.568 --> 01:57.470
Tina, that's the third time
you sighed on my sandwich.

01:57.471 --> 01:58.771
You're heating up the bread.

01:58.772 --> 02:01.441
It just seems like everyone's going
to Tammy's Bat Mitzvah but me.

02:01.442 --> 02:03.610
But you got to go to
Shauna's Bat Mitzvah.

02:03.611 --> 02:05.111
Shauna had a Bat Mitzvah?

02:05.112 --> 02:06.846
Oh! Uh...

02:06.847 --> 02:08.514
No!

02:08.514 --> 02:10.917
Mom! Shauna Glassman
had five caterers

02:10.918 --> 02:13.286
at her Bat Mitzvah and everyone
talked about how great that was.

02:13.287 --> 02:14.954
So, we need <i>six</i> caterers.

02:14.989 --> 02:17.991
Find me another caterer or
I'm gonna find another mom!

02:17.992 --> 02:20.660
Excuse me, Tammy? I couldn't help
overhearing your conversation.

02:20.694 --> 02:23.663
If you need another caterer for
your Bat Mitzvah, my dad can do it.

02:23.664 --> 02:25.832
We help him with catering jobs
all the time.

02:25.833 --> 02:26.866
No, no, we can't do that.

02:26.867 --> 02:27.934
(groans) What does he do again?

02:27.935 --> 02:28.935
Nothing. No...
Burgers.

02:28.936 --> 02:30.003
(groans) Can he do sliders?

02:30.004 --> 02:31.371
'Cause I want slider burgers.

02:31.372 --> 02:32.538
Oh, no, he's terrible at sliders.

02:32.539 --> 02:34.507
He can do sliders.
No, he...

02:34.508 --> 02:36.376
He can make them as small as you
want. Oh... He has a real...

02:36.377 --> 02:37.877
He can make them so small
you can't even see them. No.

02:37.878 --> 02:38.945
I'm eating one right now.

02:38.946 --> 02:39.979
(groans) Fine.
(phone ringing)

02:39.980 --> 02:41.147
He's hired, he's hired.

02:41.148 --> 02:42.148
No!
Oh, okay.

02:42.149 --> 02:43.148
We'll be there!

02:43.150 --> 02:44.450
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:44.451 --> 02:45.718
Just have your parents
call my parents.

02:45.719 --> 02:46.786
I got to take this.

02:46.787 --> 02:48.788
What is it now, Rabbi Rosenberg?

02:48.789 --> 02:50.223
What is it now?

02:50.224 --> 02:51.724
Yes!
Great!

02:51.725 --> 02:53.660
Now we all have to go
to that "Brat" Mitzvah.

02:53.661 --> 02:55.128
Have fun explaining this to Dad!

02:55.129 --> 02:56.496
I'm sure Dad will love it.

02:56.530 --> 02:57.529
No way.

02:57.531 --> 02:58.531
Dad, you have to!

02:58.565 --> 02:59.799
No I don't, Tina.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.867
I-I don't like catering.

03:00.868 --> 03:03.303
You guys always wander off and
leave me with all the work.

03:03.304 --> 03:06.139
Dad, this is the only way I get
to go to Tammy's Bat Mitzvah!

03:06.140 --> 03:08.408
Tina, this isn't going
to Tammy's Bat Mitzvah.

03:08.409 --> 03:09.509
It's working at it.

03:09.510 --> 03:12.645
Won't it be awkward for you with
all your friends there as guests?

03:12.646 --> 03:14.881
You don't understand!
This is my way in!

03:14.882 --> 03:16.683
She's having B-FOS
from all around the world!

03:16.717 --> 03:18.051
(groaning)

03:18.052 --> 03:20.153
All right, calm down.
That's it.

03:20.154 --> 03:22.221
Get all the blood to your head.
Let it flow.

03:22.222 --> 03:23.623
Does it really mean
that much to you?

03:23.657 --> 03:25.792
- Yes! Look at my face!
- Oh, my God.

03:25.793 --> 03:27.527
Aah! One luftballon!

03:27.528 --> 03:29.028
Okay, get her up, get her up!

03:29.029 --> 03:30.964
(all gru.ting)

03:30.998 --> 03:32.165
I don't know.

03:32.199 --> 03:33.232
We won't leave you alone

03:33.233 --> 03:35.301
this time, Bobby. Right, guys?

03:35.302 --> 03:36.502
Eh.
Soft maybe.

03:36.503 --> 03:37.670
Please, Dad?

03:37.705 --> 03:38.938
Fine. We'll do it.

03:38.973 --> 03:40.840
Yay!
All right!

03:40.874 --> 03:42.141
Now can I get circumcised?

03:42.142 --> 03:44.010
Gene.
I know some people.

03:50.353 --> 03:52.821
Look at all this food.

03:52.822 --> 03:55.357
It's like we died and went to
fancy mall food court heaven.

03:55.358 --> 03:58.060
That is the creepiest
thing I've ever seen.

03:58.094 --> 03:59.227
TINA: I think it's nice.

03:59.262 --> 04:00.262
Two mini burgers, please.

04:00.263 --> 04:01.496
Hey, Jimmy Jr.

04:01.531 --> 04:03.432
Zeke.
What's it like out there?

04:03.466 --> 04:05.867
So sweet. They even have
a DJ in the bathroom.

04:05.868 --> 04:08.170
I was dancing so hard I
forgot why I went in there.

04:08.204 --> 04:09.638
Wow.
I've had not one,

04:09.639 --> 04:11.940
not two, but three Tammy-tinis!

04:11.941 --> 04:13.341
I'm waiting for the sugar
to hit me!

04:13.342 --> 04:14.710
Here I go, oh!
Here he goes.

04:14.711 --> 04:16.478
It's gonna happen.
It's coming!

04:16.478 --> 04:17.978
Here we go. Kaboom!

04:17.980 --> 04:19.180
Nice!

04:19.182 --> 04:20.815
I'm hyper. Officially hyper.

04:20.817 --> 04:22.150
Wow, sounds grea...

04:22.151 --> 04:23.318
Hey, can we get those mini burgers?

04:23.319 --> 04:24.619
They're taking a long time.

04:24.620 --> 04:25.620
Oh, right.

04:25.621 --> 04:27.589
Hurry up, T-town.

04:27.623 --> 04:29.858
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

04:29.892 --> 04:31.293
for the star of the evening.

04:31.294 --> 04:33.161
Tammy!

04:35.364 --> 04:37.365

04:47.210 --> 04:49.010
Hey, everyone!

04:49.011 --> 04:50.212
Mazel tov to me!

04:50.246 --> 04:52.047
Mazel tov!

04:52.081 --> 04:55.317
Tina, is this Tammy-tastrophe
everything you dreamed it would be?

04:55.318 --> 04:56.718
I wish I was more in the mix.

04:56.719 --> 04:58.220
From here, I can only
look at the B-FOS,

04:58.221 --> 04:59.755
but not touch.
You could probably touch them.

04:59.756 --> 05:01.323
You think so?
Yeah.

05:01.324 --> 05:02.524
(grunting)

05:02.558 --> 05:03.592
No, I can't.
Aw, I have

05:03.593 --> 05:04.726
bad depth perception, sorry.

05:04.727 --> 05:06.294
What's going on here?

05:06.329 --> 05:08.497
Where are the Tammy toothpicks?
Tammy what?

05:08.531 --> 05:11.500
All of the food is supposed to have
toothpicks with my face on top.

05:11.534 --> 05:13.068
Janet, what's happening?

05:13.069 --> 05:14.870
Here are your toothpicks.

05:14.871 --> 05:16.738
And here's your headset.

05:16.739 --> 05:18.106
You didn't give them
a headset either?

05:18.107 --> 05:20.175
God, Janet!
What's this for?

05:20.209 --> 05:23.044
So Janet can stay in contact
with all the caterers. Duh.

05:23.079 --> 05:24.846
Why would we need
to stay in contact?

05:24.881 --> 05:26.615
Hello?! The toothpicks?

05:26.616 --> 05:27.949
That was almost a major disaster.

05:27.950 --> 05:29.584
Uh, you're kind
of exaggerating, Tammy.

05:29.585 --> 05:30.685
I'm exaggerating?

05:30.686 --> 05:32.020
Yeah, I think so.
A little bit.

05:32.054 --> 05:34.256
That is literally
the stupidest thing

05:34.257 --> 05:36.091
that anyone has ever said
in the history of mankind.

05:36.092 --> 05:37.359
Ever!

05:37.393 --> 05:38.827
You're having a hard day, I think.

05:38.861 --> 05:39.861
I'm having the best day of my life.

05:39.862 --> 05:40.962
It's my Bat Mitzvah.

05:40.963 --> 05:42.230
You're a wonderful little girl.

05:42.231 --> 05:43.231
Thank you.

05:43.266 --> 05:44.299
What a 'tude.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.567
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

05:45.568 --> 05:47.936
During the walk there and back,
it'll be like I'm at the party.

05:47.937 --> 05:49.371
Great, now we lost Tina.

05:49.372 --> 05:50.939
No one else is allowed to leave.

05:50.973 --> 05:52.407
TAMMY (over headset): Janet,
we're out of ranch dressing!

05:52.408 --> 05:54.075
JANET: Um... I-I...
If a chicken tender

05:54.076 --> 05:55.410
touches my lips
without ranch dressing

05:55.411 --> 05:57.078
I am literally
going to kill someone!

05:57.079 --> 05:58.413
I'm not wearing this.

05:58.414 --> 05:59.414
I'll take that.

05:59.415 --> 06:02.384
Bat Zilla.

06:02.385 --> 06:05.020
(roaring)

06:05.054 --> 06:06.621
Oh, no. Who said that?

06:06.622 --> 06:08.156
Janet, are you listening to me?

06:08.157 --> 06:09.891
LOUISE: Bat Zilla's angry, Janet.

06:09.926 --> 06:11.226
What are you gonna do?

06:11.227 --> 06:12.627
JANET:
Uh, please, if this could just,

06:12.628 --> 06:14.396
uh, I've got two and half me hours?

06:14.430 --> 06:17.065
Bat Zilla's gonna kill you
in under two.

06:17.066 --> 06:18.266
(whispering):
You're absolutely right.

06:18.267 --> 06:19.568
You're absolutely right.

06:19.569 --> 06:20.902
Janet, you got to get out of this.

06:20.903 --> 06:21.937
Please help, please help!

06:21.938 --> 06:23.471
You're better than this!

06:23.472 --> 06:25.106
Janet, you know you can do better!

06:25.141 --> 06:28.210
Who are you?
The voice in your head, Janet.

06:28.244 --> 06:30.045
Ah, no big deal.

06:30.079 --> 06:31.379
Just the single greatest collection

06:31.380 --> 06:32.860
of food ever assembled
under one roof.

06:32.882 --> 06:35.417
Not gonna wander off.
Nah, good Linda.

06:35.418 --> 06:36.751
Stay right here.

06:36.752 --> 06:38.920
(sniffs)

06:38.921 --> 06:40.222
The crepes smell good.

06:40.223 --> 06:42.591
The crepes smell real good!

06:42.625 --> 06:43.892
Don't know you, don't know you.

06:43.893 --> 06:45.026
Janet!

06:45.061 --> 06:46.661
What's wrong with Tammy's eye?

06:46.662 --> 06:48.964
Uh, that one's a little
bigger than that one.

06:48.998 --> 06:51.032
Not me! Her!
Uh, uh...

06:51.067 --> 06:53.435
I need someone to fix the
bulb on the Tammy head stat.

06:53.436 --> 06:55.470
Janet, you got to get out of here.

06:55.504 --> 06:58.473
I do, I do. What are you
doing here still, Janet?

06:58.507 --> 07:01.254
What are your dreams?
I know you've got dreams.

07:01.277 --> 07:03.745
I'm gonna... move to New York.

07:03.746 --> 07:06.114
You should go there, Janet.

07:06.115 --> 07:08.149
And I'm gonna sing and dance!

07:08.150 --> 07:09.851
Give me some of that singing.

07:09.852 --> 07:11.253
Give it to me now, Janet.

07:11.254 --> 07:12.821
♪ Start sp... ♪

07:12.822 --> 07:14.456
Wake up, Janet! Wake up.

07:14.457 --> 07:15.957
You wake up, Tammy.

07:15.958 --> 07:17.325
'Cause guess what?

07:17.326 --> 07:19.160
I quit!
What?!

07:19.161 --> 07:23.431
Oh, how the tides
have turned, Tammy!

07:23.432 --> 07:24.933
Janet, don't you dare.

07:24.934 --> 07:26.568
Oh, look at me.

07:26.569 --> 07:28.336
The headset's a-coming
off of the ears!

07:28.337 --> 07:29.604
Janet, don't you take
that ear... headset off!

07:29.605 --> 07:31.406
I can't hear you anymore!
Janet!

07:31.407 --> 07:33.174
Look I respond to nothing, Tammy!

07:33.175 --> 07:35.310
Janet! Janet!

07:35.311 --> 07:38.380
Nothing but my own desire to be
a star!

07:38.414 --> 07:39.447
Janet!

07:39.448 --> 07:40.682
(laughs)

07:40.683 --> 07:42.851
Oh, voice, voice,
you've taught me well.

07:42.852 --> 07:44.489
Janet!

07:44.490 --> 07:45.799
You're welcome, Janet.

07:45.825 --> 07:47.192
Excuse me, Tammy?

07:47.193 --> 07:48.727
This might not be the best time

07:48.728 --> 07:50.228
but can you tell me where
the ladies' room is?

07:50.229 --> 07:51.496
(groans) Not now, Tina!

07:51.497 --> 07:52.731
(panting)

07:52.732 --> 07:54.666
Wait, how good are you
with a clipboard?

07:54.667 --> 07:56.368
I'm okay.

07:56.369 --> 07:58.169
Sometimes I get my fingers
caught in the clip thing.

07:58.170 --> 07:59.604
Here, you're my new coordinator.

07:59.605 --> 08:00.672
I am?
Yeah.

08:00.673 --> 08:02.907
You wanted to be at the party...
now you're running the party.

08:02.908 --> 08:04.342
Okay, I'll do the...

08:04.343 --> 08:06.711
First, the schedule's
on the clipboard.

08:06.712 --> 08:08.213
We have to stick to
it no matter what.

08:08.214 --> 08:09.247
Got it?
Check.

08:09.248 --> 08:10.248
See all those people?

08:10.249 --> 08:11.282
Those are my relatives.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.284
We're not close and they
all have old person face.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.286
So it's your job to
tell me who's who.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.287
How will I know who's...?

08:16.288 --> 08:18.556
There's a Tammy's family cheat
sheet on the clipboard.

08:18.557 --> 08:20.425
Oh, okay.
And that's Justin.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.093
He's the cutest guy
in Hebrew school.

08:22.094 --> 08:23.528
Remember that <i>punim,</i> okay?

08:23.529 --> 08:25.588
That means "face"
in old Jewish language.

08:25.598 --> 08:27.841
Justin.
The ladies choice dance is at 9:30.

08:27.867 --> 08:29.267
And by ladies, I mean me.

08:29.268 --> 08:31.069
I'm choosing Justin
as my dance partner.

08:31.070 --> 08:32.904
That makes sense. And that'll
lead right into the hora,

08:32.905 --> 08:34.405
which is when I get
lifted into a chair

08:34.407 --> 08:36.741
and I feel like a Jewish movie
star, like Whoopi Goldberg.

08:36.741 --> 08:38.876
Would it be okay if I went
to the bathroom really fast?

08:38.878 --> 08:40.445
Never mind, I-I'll hold it.

08:40.446 --> 08:42.514
I'll make it go away.
You do that.

08:42.548 --> 08:44.416
LOUISE:
Tina, did you just get bat-bullied

08:44.417 --> 08:45.917
into being a party planner?

08:45.918 --> 08:47.452
Louise?
This line is for work only.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.820
Why do you want to
be the new Janet?

08:48.821 --> 08:51.256
Well, at least I'm not stuck
behind the burger station.

08:51.290 --> 08:52.757
TAMMY: Tina, I've got a wedgie

08:52.758 --> 08:53.958
and I'm not gonna pick it
at my own party!

08:53.959 --> 08:56.027
Janet had small fingers!
Got to go.

08:56.062 --> 08:57.595
Hmm.

08:58.898 --> 09:00.131
Hello, guac.

09:00.132 --> 09:01.666
Let's take a little walk.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.436
Uh, where's Louise?
Did we lose her, too?

09:04.437 --> 09:06.271
She's on the Mexican food,
Chinese food border.

09:06.272 --> 09:07.439
It's a war zone!

09:07.440 --> 09:08.506
I'll go see if she needs backup.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.075
No.
Oh, boo.

09:10.076 --> 09:12.110
Bobby, I'm getting light-headed,
I need some air.

09:12.144 --> 09:14.112
Lin, you're not light-headed.
You want a crepe.

09:14.113 --> 09:16.147
You've been saying crepe under
your breath for ten minutes.

09:16.148 --> 09:17.148
What?!

09:17.149 --> 09:18.316
Crepe.

09:18.317 --> 09:19.317
There's crepes here?

09:19.318 --> 09:20.351
Crepe.
You're doing it.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.486
I am not!

09:21.487 --> 09:22.787
Don't be ridiculous!

09:22.788 --> 09:23.955
Crepe.
You just did it.

09:23.956 --> 09:25.090
Crepe. What?!
Oh, my God.

09:25.091 --> 09:26.357
I didn't do nothing.
Just go.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.358
I told you, I'm light-headed.

09:27.359 --> 09:28.358
Just go.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.794
Crepe, crepe, crepe.
Go.

09:29.795 --> 09:31.129
Crepe, crepe, crepe, crepe,

09:31.130 --> 09:32.263
cr... I'll be, I'll be right back!

09:32.298 --> 09:33.565
Mm-hmm.
Crepe! Crepe!

09:33.599 --> 09:35.467
Wait for me, Mom!

09:35.468 --> 09:37.102
(grunts) Why aren't I moving?

09:37.103 --> 09:38.503
I will not be left alone.

09:38.504 --> 09:40.004
But Mom said she'd be right back!

09:40.005 --> 09:41.506
Gene, look at me.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.709
You and I both know your mom's not
coming back after just one crepe.

09:44.710 --> 09:45.877
She's not gonna stop, Gene.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.278
She's never gonna stop.

09:47.279 --> 09:48.279
It's who she is.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.447
If she stops, she'll die.

09:49.448 --> 09:50.448
Like a crepe shark.

09:50.449 --> 09:51.449
Gene?
Yes.

09:51.450 --> 09:53.017
We need to stick together.

09:53.018 --> 09:54.619
I'm gonna grill and
you're gonna plate.

09:54.620 --> 09:57.021
Dad, I never realized
how soulful your eyes are.

09:57.022 --> 09:58.223
(groans) Gene.

09:58.224 --> 09:59.524
Wait, really?

10:00.860 --> 10:02.127
Aunt Frida from Florida.

10:02.161 --> 10:04.129
She had hip-replacement
surgery last year.

10:04.130 --> 10:06.030
Aunt Frida!
Your new hip looks hot.

10:06.031 --> 10:09.567
Tammy, I'm so proud
of you on your big day.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.536
(grunting) We got a clinger!

10:11.537 --> 10:13.638
Tina.
Let go of Tammy.

10:13.639 --> 10:14.873
(grunts)

10:14.874 --> 10:16.141
Those are your parents.

10:16.142 --> 10:17.659
I know who my parents are, Tina.

10:17.676 --> 10:19.177
Are you having fun, honey?

10:19.178 --> 10:21.646
Mom, You got
your weird perfume on me!

10:21.647 --> 10:24.082
(groans) I got to go swab this off.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.683
Tina, make sure we
stay on schedule.

10:25.684 --> 10:26.818
Okay.
It's not weird.

10:26.819 --> 10:27.819
You like it, right?

10:27.820 --> 10:28.820
Um, yeah, I like it.

10:28.821 --> 10:30.321
I wear it. It's bisexual.

10:30.322 --> 10:31.322
Do you mean unisex?

10:31.323 --> 10:32.323
It's the same thing.

10:32.324 --> 10:33.691
It is not the same thing.

10:33.692 --> 10:36.494
My swim-aerobics instructor
is bisexual.

10:36.495 --> 10:38.496
Thank you, Frida.

10:38.531 --> 10:39.831
(humming)

10:39.832 --> 10:41.766
What? This shouldn't be open!

10:41.767 --> 10:44.102
Looks like you got
a runny nose, Tammy.

10:44.103 --> 10:45.170
(Tammy gasps)

10:45.171 --> 10:46.688
What are you doing in my head?

10:46.705 --> 10:48.006
(gasps) Whoops.

10:48.007 --> 10:49.908
Hey, Tammy!
Good to see you there.

10:49.909 --> 10:51.910
I thought the tortilla chips
were in here.

10:51.911 --> 10:54.179
Which is like, so creative.

10:54.180 --> 10:55.547
But I guess not.

10:55.581 --> 10:57.382
(gasps) You were going
to pour guacamole

10:57.383 --> 10:59.701
out of my nose like
boogers, weren't you?!

10:59.718 --> 11:02.353

Tammy, that's hilarious.

11:02.354 --> 11:03.555
Let's do it!

11:03.589 --> 11:05.390
Stop it!

11:19.271 --> 11:21.272
The Klezbians are
not a terrible band!

Hi, Other Janet.

13:27.887 --> 13:29.354
Sometimes when Tammy gets like this

13:29.355 --> 13:31.590

13:52.845 --> 13:54.079
Not that low.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.514
Still too low.

13:55.515 --> 13:57.482
Yeah, a little higher.
Mm, one more inch?

13:57.517 --> 13:59.451
Well, you'll walk
right under it now!

13:59.452 --> 14:01.386
Yeah, but just in case,
a little higher.

14:01.387 --> 14:03.322
Okay, everybody, let's limbo!

14:03.356 --> 14:05.591
What the hell is your sister doing?

14:05.592 --> 14:06.825
Looks like the limbo.

14:06.859 --> 14:09.061
Or some awkward version of it.

14:09.062 --> 14:11.129
I was supposed to
lead off the limbo.

14:11.130 --> 14:13.732
I was the one who went
to limbo boot camp!

14:13.766 --> 14:15.200
Limbo, check.

Next on the schedule
is the conga line.

We are not in the same hall
as we were a minute ago.

14:45.398 --> 14:47.566
It's like the end of

Hey, boys.

Oh, hey, okay.

Looks like they're
doing fine without you.
