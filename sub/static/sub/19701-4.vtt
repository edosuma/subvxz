The Solasta women's initiative,

00:02.100 --> 00:05.070
.. it offers a series
of bespoke internships.

00:05.120 --> 00:08.550
- I want in. - So, you're in.
- Any advice for the newbie?

00:08.600 --> 00:10.830
Keep your head.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.430
You don't get it. But you will.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.350
I need to figure out what's going on.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.590
I've always wanted to be
on the Steiner account.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.540
I'm not so good at the other stuff.

00:21.280 --> 00:25.160
Stuff's happening for me, Holly.
Don't fucking ruin it, OK?

00:28.280 --> 00:31.630
Try to have fun. This is
your time too, remember.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.950
Do interns do all your customer checks?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.190
- Sometimes. - So technically
you could fake that report.

00:37.240 --> 00:40.070
She was committing fraud on
your watch, making thousands.

00:40.120 --> 00:43.270
You're right. But for
herself, Holly, not for me.

00:43.320 --> 00:47.590
- And James Buxton?
- He was doing it with her.

- It's morning.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.480
Middle of the night.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.880
I've got a lecture.

01:38.020 --> 01:38.990
Morning!

01:40.240 --> 01:41.950
Jesus!

01:42.000 --> 01:43.990
Off you pop!

01:44.040 --> 01:46.400
That's it. Shower time.

01:52.120 --> 01:55.750
Mmm. Chill, darling. I'm spoken for.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.390
There's a boy in our house.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.520
And he's pretty.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.310
- Lily.
- We're going to be late.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.430
- You're dressed.
- I'm naked.

02:07.480 --> 02:08.880
You ginormous whore!

02:12.480 --> 02:14.880
Excuse me. Sorry.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.350
- I've got a meeting I need to prep for.
- Wing it, babe.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.680
Honestly, that is what I do.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.720
Where is everyone going?

02:29.840 --> 02:31.560
What is going on?

02:32.800 --> 02:34.080
Rachel.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.990
Something's happened.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.760
Come on. I think it's about James.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.480
Jude.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.910
Solasta interns deigned
to come to lectures?

03:07.960 --> 03:10.830
I'm good, thanks, Elizabeth. How are you?

03:10.880 --> 03:14.380
- What did you get on your first essay?
- I haven't picked it up yet.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.590
I actually know your student number,
so I can tell you if you like.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.750
You did quite well.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.470
Although the marks were
low across the board.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.680
- You memorised my student number?
- Stop talking, please.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.760
You two!

03:33.520 --> 03:35.640
Good. Let's begin, shall we?

03:37.400 --> 03:41.230
I have no doubt that you have all
been scrabbling with sticky fingers

03:41.280 --> 03:43.310
to log on for your essay results

03:43.360 --> 03:47.110
and I have no doubt that most
of you will be disappointed.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.310
I have never read such a banal
set of first-year essays.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.790
- Why is she so moody?
- Shush!

03:51.840 --> 03:54.070
You need to have a talk with yourselves.

03:54.120 --> 03:58.110
Since you so clearly need
a kick up the backside,

03:58.160 --> 04:00.590
I'm throwing a little extra test your way.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.030
Because life will fuck you like that.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.670
Over the course of the next
week you will all be required

04:05.720 --> 04:08.110
to come to my office to
complete a ten-minute oral.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.790
A list of questions is
available on the portal,

04:11.840 --> 04:14.940
along with the randomly
selected times of your test.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.589
None of you are working at
the level that I expect,

04:18.640 --> 04:21.070
and that is going to change.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.310
Am I clear?

04:37.840 --> 04:43.470
- Will you turn it up? Will you turn the TV up?
- Yeah, give us a sec.

04:43.520 --> 04:47.190

'Of course.'

06:40.640 --> 06:43.350

07:14.200 --> 07:16.200
Hey.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.120
I tried calling.

07:24.680 --> 07:27.480
- I'm sorry.
- Hey...

07:36.320 --> 07:38.670
I thought he would be OK.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.440
I know.

07:42.280 --> 07:45.040
I told him to go to his
parents' house for a while.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.470
Straighten his head.

07:48.520 --> 07:49.720
He never went.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.960
- Come inside.
- No, I can't.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.160
I just wanted to see you.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.350
Don't judge us. It's a
tequila kind of day.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.390
Pour me a glass.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.160
Good girl.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.240
- What do we do?
- What do you mean "do"?

08:39.280 --> 08:40.950
There's nothing we can do.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.870
It doesn't look good.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.830
If there's an investigation, there
will be a decrease in clients.

08:45.880 --> 08:48.230
If they start letting people
go, we're the easiest cut.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.280
What the hell are you talking about?

08:51.120 --> 08:54.790
- James is dead. - Good.
- Hey. You don't mean that.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.670
I refuse to care.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.510
Fay changed after he got in her head.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.070
You think all this is because of him?

09:00.120 --> 09:03.030
Who else is that fucking stupid?
It was blatantly his fault.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.630
How did they get so deep in shit?

09:05.680 --> 09:07.910
It is Steiner, right?

09:07.960 --> 09:09.430
George is out there with him now.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.630
- Don't worry about George.
- We don't know what she's doing.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.550
Georgia is window-dressing.

09:14.600 --> 09:18.230
Steiner's last pretty
girl ended up dead, Phoebe.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.350
- But whatever.
- Yes, because she was stealing, Holly.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.310
So long as George is
playing the game right,

09:23.360 --> 09:26.070
and keeping her hands out of
the till, you can stop worrying.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.640
Louise? Tell me you can
hear how insane this is?

09:31.960 --> 09:34.990
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm going to get my girlfriend round

09:35.040 --> 09:37.840
and pretend none of this
exists. Is that allowed?

09:38.760 --> 09:42.040
- Can I have one hour?
- We need to prep for Georgia's party.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.470
Why the fuck are we having a party?

09:45.520 --> 09:48.200
Why do you keep making
everyone's shit harder?

09:51.800 --> 09:53.320
Tell me I'm wrong.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.360
You're part of this world too.

11:03.360 --> 11:07.880
'The number you have dialled has not
been recognised. Please try again.'

11:29.960 --> 11:33.230
- I've reviewed the questions.
- OK.

11:33.280 --> 11:36.230
I think our best bet is to
start with the lecture material

11:36.280 --> 11:40.230
and then try to formulate some of our
own opinions on recent developments.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.180
That way we can quiz each
other and practise for it.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.430
Hey.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.750
I don't care about the oral exam.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.710
Well, you should. Because
we said we'd work together,

11:53.760 --> 11:55.560
so you'd be letting me down too.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.550
What book is that?

12:04.600 --> 12:07.390
- What?
- What book is the reference for?

12:07.440 --> 12:09.670
It's not one from my list.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.950
Tell me you understand the Library
of Congress classification system.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.750
- Not every thing is done by
Dewey, you know. - No -- show me.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.630
OK, that's novellas,

12:18.680 --> 12:20.390
that's shelf 56,

12:20.440 --> 12:23.840
and that's the first three
letters of the author's surname.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.000
That's 11 favours you now owe me, Holly.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.830
- 'Who is that?
- That is Lukas Steiner.'

13:36.880 --> 13:38.590
'So Solasta manages his money?'

13:38.640 --> 13:42.280
'He is richer than Bono and
everyone wants his cash.'

13:44.280 --> 13:45.670
'Relationship management.

13:45.720 --> 13:48.480
'I've always wanted to be
on the Steiner account.'

13:52.800 --> 13:55.150
'Is James on the Steiner team?'

13:55.200 --> 13:58.240
- 'Steiner account, yeah.
- Does he know what happened?'

14:47.520 --> 14:50.390
What's going on? You
sounded funny on the phone.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.470
I'm fine.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.430
OK, so, what are you doing down here?

14:55.480 --> 14:56.750
It's where they found his car.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.830
- I know. - Must be where
he went into the water.

15:00.880 --> 15:04.750
- Let me give you a lift
back to my place. - Whatever.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.110
- Holly, wait, what's going on?
- Nothing.

15:07.160 --> 15:08.910
Holly!

15:08.960 --> 15:12.840
- Just leave it. - Please tell
me. let me help. - You can't help.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.310
You're one of them.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.640
What?!

15:19.880 --> 15:22.120
You kissed me and you...

15:23.280 --> 15:26.990
You make me believe that there's
something happening between us.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.990
- Something real.
- There is.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.950
I don't know you.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.030
We don't know each other at all.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.510
What? Holly... Look, just listen to me.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.280
- Just tell me what is going on.
- I don't think James killed himself.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.550
I'm not mad.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.990
- I know you are not mad.
- Someone is sending me things.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.590
- What? - From James's
e-mail, from his phone.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.430
But he is dead, Rory.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.760
- I need to tell the police.
- No, just...

15:55.960 --> 15:58.150
- Just wait.
- The police have got this wrong.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.870
They don't understand what is going on.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.320
- Yes, they do.
- How the fuck do you know?

16:07.720 --> 16:11.400
Because I am the police.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.080
What? What?!

16:38.040 --> 16:40.630
You better start explaining
pretty fucking quickly.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.590
Tom, just hear me out
for a minute, all right?

16:43.640 --> 16:45.710
I don't even know what
I'm doing down here.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.790
I should be upstairs telling the team

16:47.840 --> 16:50.350
that our informant has
completely fucked us.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.950
She worked me out. She interns at Solasta.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.670
She has information she will not
give me without verification.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.550
Then get her in. Set up a debrief.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.470
Don't drive me in a car
and jeopardise my job.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.070
We need this, Tom. We've
been stalled for months.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.750
- Yeah, and whose fault is that?
- I am doing my best.

17:05.800 --> 17:10.640
You're not the one there
risking your fucking skin.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.710
Look, let me keep trying.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.160
You can trust her. We
want the same things.

17:20.839 --> 17:21.880
Please.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.480
I'm Rory's handler.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.880
She can't say or do anything.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.560
Understand?

17:46.840 --> 17:47.960
I'm sorry.

17:56.360 --> 17:59.460
The police have been watching
Solasta for two years.

18:01.440 --> 18:02.790
I don't understand.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.430
They came to me when I was
still working in the City,

18:05.480 --> 18:07.350
made a proposition.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.390
I was flattered. It started off so small,

18:10.440 --> 18:12.830
just passing on things here and there.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.510
But Steiner changed all that.

18:15.560 --> 18:16.750
The man is evil.

18:16.800 --> 18:19.500
He's been exploiting
people all over the world.

18:20.440 --> 18:23.590
If you knew that, then why
wouldn't you get Fay and James out?

18:23.640 --> 18:26.840
Because if you move too soon,
the whole thing comes down.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.760
Don't you think Alistair knows
how to cover his tracks?

18:31.960 --> 18:34.150
This goes beyond me, you, James and Fay.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.710
This is international.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.760
But we have a chance. We have
a chance to get them all.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.320
You've been lying to me this whole time.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.990
This whole thing, everyone is a liar.

18:47.040 --> 18:50.470
Holly, Holly.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.990
Holly, listen to me.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.880
No, no. Listen to me.

18:56.360 --> 18:59.110
It's still me.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.320
It's still me.

19:09.320 --> 19:11.520
I need you. I need you.

20:30.720 --> 20:34.070
Steiner's real name is Florian Helmlinger.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.910
He's a monster.

20:35.960 --> 20:39.060
- I know. - Alistair has been
cleaning his money for him.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.720
Hiding it, investing it. Legitimising him.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.680
Every single transaction, it's all here.

20:52.480 --> 20:55.000
- I need your phone.
- Why?

20:56.520 --> 20:59.420
We need to trace whoever
is sending you this stuff.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.000
Thank you.

21:06.120 --> 21:09.710
Georgia is back tonight
from Vienna with Steiner.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.950
Just give me a few days, please.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.600
And then what?

21:14.680 --> 21:16.550
If we wait and the
police move in on Solasta

21:16.600 --> 21:19.360
- then she'll go down with them.
- I don't think so.

21:21.600 --> 21:25.510
- That is not good enough.
- But you are doing the right thing.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.270
You have helped.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.270
You can stop now. All
of this can stop now.

21:29.320 --> 21:32.230
- Not for her.
- Holly,

21:32.280 --> 21:34.400
you have to stop.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.040
Promise me.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.230
- Have you met Charlie boy?
- No.

22:36.280 --> 22:40.310
You girls going to mingle or stand
looking like an ad campaign?

22:40.360 --> 22:41.680
We will.

22:43.880 --> 22:47.230
- You OK, sweetheart? - Yeah.
- I know things are hard.

22:47.280 --> 22:50.320
- She's just tired.
- No, she's upset. We all are.

22:51.680 --> 22:54.390
So here's what we do. We
pull our shit together,

22:54.440 --> 22:56.750
we don't fall apart when
something hard happens, OK?

22:56.800 --> 22:59.950
You set the tone. Set
the tone for Georgia.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.360
Pom-poms or unicorns, do you reckon?

23:05.360 --> 23:07.310
Look what the cat dragged in.

23:07.360 --> 23:09.630
- Where are they, Ju?
- You going to behave?

23:09.680 --> 23:11.510
- Babes.
- Why?

23:11.560 --> 23:14.470
Me and you can't fake
as well as these two.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.670
Don't worry, Phoebs, I'm a good girl.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.440
You look like shit.

23:25.400 --> 23:29.800
- Lukas, hello.
- Welcome back, babe.

23:36.760 --> 23:40.680
- Welcome home, George.
- Come on, darling.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.200
All right, McStay?

24:04.280 --> 24:09.040
- Babe. Not here.
- Babe, it's fine.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.390
How was Vienna, Georgia?

24:17.440 --> 24:19.940
Amazing. Do you fancy a
pick-me-up, Professor?

24:20.800 --> 24:22.950
Always feisty!

24:23.000 --> 24:25.030
How long are you with us, Lukas?

24:25.080 --> 24:27.190
Just a couple of things to firm up,

24:27.240 --> 24:29.430
thought I would come back
for some Scottish air.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.790
- Have you spoken to Alistair?
- I'm going there next,

24:31.840 --> 24:33.740
just delivering the party girl.

24:36.480 --> 24:40.350
They're talking shop.
Yawn. Come on, darling.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.440
Lou, grab a bottle.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.600
Hey, gorgeous.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.950
Miss me?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.510
How was it?

25:05.560 --> 25:08.560
You know... fine.

25:10.360 --> 25:11.400
Long.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.040
And Georgia?

25:16.280 --> 25:18.190
She did well.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.000
Did well at what, exactly?

25:22.640 --> 25:24.240
She's been trained.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.150
- There's lots to learn.
- Charlie, tell me the fucking truth.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.030
Well, ask her yourself, you daft bitch.

25:30.080 --> 25:31.670
They're keeping her away from me.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.320
Yeah, I'm starting to see why.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.480
She's fucked up.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.990
She's fucked up like Fay. You were
there too. What were you doing?

25:43.040 --> 25:44.240
I looked after her.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.510
All right?

25:48.560 --> 25:50.310
I did my best.

25:50.360 --> 25:52.560
- Wait. - You're getting
on my tits, McStay.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.360
Hi, fuck-face.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.360
What's got into you?

26:19.720 --> 26:21.720
I missed you.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.080
You're losing your edge, Charlie boy.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.200
I'm so tired.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.600
Don't be a pussy.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.200
OK. Thank you.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.440
Are you OK?

27:10.200 --> 27:12.960
- You can't help me.
- Try me.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.760
Holly.

27:52.080 --> 27:55.190
George. George. Listen to me.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.390
- Guess we're going over here.
- Take it easy, Holly!

27:57.440 --> 28:00.710
- Let's leave. - What?
- These people are bad, George.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.430
You know it and I know you know it.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.270
You told me you were going
to stop with all this shit.

28:05.320 --> 28:07.430
We can get on a bus.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.870
We can be home in an hour.
You don't have to do this.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.990
You're ill. I'm gonna call your
dad, you're fucking insane.

28:13.040 --> 28:16.190
What are you doing? Don't do this, Holly.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.030
You're not safe.>

28:18.080 --> 28:20.390
Steiner is a criminal, a
fucking murderer, George.

28:20.440 --> 28:22.270
- Why don't you believe me?
- Get off me.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.990
Holly, you're ruining everyone's night.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.320
Just SHUT THE FUCK UP, Phoebe.

28:29.360 --> 28:31.710
I need you to listen to me.

28:31.760 --> 28:35.120
She's mad. She totally fucking mad.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.030
Georgia, we need to fucking
go. Please, Georgia.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.880
Get off me!

28:50.400 --> 28:52.360
- Take her home.
- Come on.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.360
George.

28:57.760 --> 29:00.070
Georgia, please.

29:00.120 --> 29:01.600
Get out.

29:10.480 --> 29:13.670
- Holly, wait.
- Just leave me alone.

29:13.720 --> 29:15.600
Please, I'm sorry.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.880
Fuck.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.670
Did you forget you don't
live here any more?

29:30.720 --> 29:32.560
Please can I come in?

29:36.320 --> 29:38.000
OK.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.960
I need to stay here tonight, OK?

29:51.280 --> 29:52.960
- In my bed?
- Yeah.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.540
You could have just left them all alone.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.470
You could have just been friends with me.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.640
I know.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.120
Why do you do it?

30:28.920 --> 30:30.960
Why do you find the bad people?

30:34.600 --> 30:37.040
Because I'm like them.

30:52.760 --> 30:55.070
Who did these?

30:55.120 --> 30:56.640
They were my friends.

30:57.960 --> 31:01.800
- But you fell out? - We're not
allowed to see each other any more.

31:03.240 --> 31:05.200
Because of what you did?

31:08.480 --> 31:10.980
Tell me what happened
with the little girl.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.590
'We had a gang.

31:15.640 --> 31:20.800
'My pals and me. Will,
Ellie, Sean and Millie.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.780
'We played tricks and messed
around in the village.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.670
'It was fun,

31:29.720 --> 31:33.430
- 'but then...'
- Holly!

31:33.480 --> 31:35.230
Holly. Where are you?

31:35.280 --> 31:37.360
'Sean's wee sister was called Lisa.

31:38.520 --> 31:40.550
She ruins everything.

31:40.600 --> 31:43.070
She loves you.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.270
'I thought she was such a ninny.'

31:45.320 --> 31:47.350
Sean, send your wee sister home.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.430
She'll tell my mum we're down here.

31:49.480 --> 31:50.990
No, I won't.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.760
'Always following us, trying to join in.'

32:00.040 --> 32:02.120
- 'Annoying me.'
- Wait!

32:03.760 --> 32:06.800
Wait! Wait, guys!

32:08.600 --> 32:10.200
'So I thought up a good trick.'

32:11.280 --> 32:12.800
'It was the best one ever.'

32:16.320 --> 32:19.520
'If she wanted to be in our
gang she had to do something.'

32:38.360 --> 32:40.320
'I never thought she would do it.'

32:43.680 --> 32:45.150
One, two, three!

32:45.200 --> 32:47.720
'But she did. She did.'

33:21.520 --> 33:24.480
She wants you to stay away
from the house for a bit.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.430
Great. Message delivered.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.360
Everyone is really upset.

33:33.560 --> 33:34.600
Is that it?

33:36.440 --> 33:39.230
You're not the only one who's scared.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.360
I want to know what's going on.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.680
I lost my best friend, too.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.400
Just give me a minute.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.870
I was watching Georgia tonight.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.400
- She looked like...
- Fay.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.520
I know.

34:11.520 --> 34:15.480
I let myself believe Alistair
-- that Fay was taking money.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.239
It was easier to think that.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.639
It's not the truth, is it?

34:25.159 --> 34:27.550
Please, Holly, I need to know.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.320
Alistair framed them.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.440
Because they threatened to
out who Steiner really is.

34:42.159 --> 34:45.590
But if Fay didn't do anything wrong
then why didn't she fight back?

34:45.639 --> 34:49.150
Tell someone? Fay was brave, she was...

34:49.199 --> 34:51.429
I don't think she wanted to die and...

34:51.480 --> 34:53.480
don't think James killed himself.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.080
I don't know if I can go there.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.470
I don't know if I can think
about what that means.

35:01.520 --> 35:04.220
It is the truth, Rachel,
you know it is the truth.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.920
I'm scared.

35:11.200 --> 35:12.240
Me too.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.630
But I'm with you.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.680
I'm with you, Holly.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.070
What are you doing here?

35:35.120 --> 35:37.320
I'm here for my oral exam.

35:38.320 --> 35:39.910
I hardly think now is the time.

35:39.960 --> 35:42.310
I was given an allocated slot for my exam.

35:42.360 --> 35:44.760
I have prepared and I'm
here to deliver it.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.720
Fine.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.750
Holly McStay, Introduction
to Macroeconomics.

35:56.800 --> 36:00.000
10:40am, October 31st.

36:01.840 --> 36:04.240
Which topic have you
prepared from my list?

36:05.240 --> 36:06.680
I've chosen my own topic.

36:09.480 --> 36:10.760
Go ahead.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.990
Like many other
high-net-worth individuals,

36:18.040 --> 36:21.520
Florian Helmlinger was born
into a family business.

36:23.560 --> 36:26.230
He took his father's
example and built on it,

36:26.280 --> 36:29.790
expanding and diversifying until
he was making money so fast

36:29.840 --> 36:32.520
that he didn't know what to do with it.

36:35.120 --> 36:38.830
Drugs, extortion, intimidation.

36:38.880 --> 36:43.870
All very lucrative when you
know what you're doing.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.270
But Florian wanted more.

36:45.320 --> 36:49.920
Florian wanted to hang out with the
legitimate boys at the parties.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.790
The bankers,

36:52.840 --> 36:54.910
the entrepreneurs,

36:54.960 --> 36:56.790
the media moguls.

36:56.840 --> 37:01.310
So he needed someone to
wash that lovely money

37:01.360 --> 37:03.440
so it didn't stink of crime any more.

37:05.480 --> 37:06.840
He made a new friend.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.670
A friend with a bank.

37:11.720 --> 37:15.680
A friend who didn't care
how dirty the money was.

37:16.680 --> 37:19.190
Someone who knew how to
fake those all-important

37:19.240 --> 37:22.120
"know your customer"
checks, or, even better...

37:23.920 --> 37:26.640
.. make it seem like a
silly little intern did.

37:30.520 --> 37:34.280
So now all of that lovely
money was squeaky-clean.

37:35.400 --> 37:36.910
The man at the bank was happy

37:36.960 --> 37:40.190
because he got to keep some
of the money for his trouble.

37:40.240 --> 37:43.910
And Florian Helmlinger was happy
because all those big boys

37:43.960 --> 37:46.520
didn't look down their
noses at him any more.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.400
He got legitimacy.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.670
And the shiny new name

37:55.720 --> 37:57.150
Lukas Steiner.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.760
Stop.

38:01.320 --> 38:04.520
Private banks don't care
where their money comes from.

38:05.960 --> 38:08.190
The journalist Roberto
Saviano is quoted as saying

38:08.240 --> 38:10.710
that it's because there
aren't corpses on the streets.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.520
I said stop.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.680
He's wrong, isn't he, professor?

38:20.600 --> 38:23.200
Sometimes there are
corpses in the streets.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.300
Sometimes there are
corpses on top of cars.

38:28.440 --> 38:31.640
Sometimes there are corpses on
the banks of the Firth of Forth.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.080
Al?

38:52.600 --> 38:53.950
Al!

38:54.000 --> 38:55.480
What are you doing here?

38:56.840 --> 38:58.400
Come up here.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.160
I'm just about to go to my bed.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.280
What's the matter?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.950
I need you to tell me about Steiner.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.990
What?

39:20.040 --> 39:23.430
Tell me that you didn't
know that he's a criminal.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.350
Jesus Christ, Jude.

39:25.400 --> 39:29.480
Is this that McStay girl again?

39:31.040 --> 39:33.470
You need to stop letting her wind you up.

39:33.520 --> 39:35.320
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?

39:39.440 --> 39:41.800
We needed his account, Jude.

39:42.800 --> 39:46.790
- It kept us afloat.
- Two young people have died.

39:46.840 --> 39:48.510
They did that to themselves.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.600
Did he threaten them?

39:53.080 --> 39:55.670
- I don't know.
- Fucking hell.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.640
Look, I thought it was nothing.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.670
By the time

40:00.720 --> 40:03.960
I started to realise, it
was too late and we'd...

40:06.440 --> 40:08.310
It was just business.

40:08.360 --> 40:09.760
Don't fucking touch me!

40:16.960 --> 40:18.520
What do I do?

40:20.920 --> 40:22.360
I'll deal with it.

40:28.240 --> 40:29.800
I'm sorry.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.720
- Hi.
- Hey.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.400
I need to check my e-mail.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.840
Help yourself.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.160
Are you OK?

41:26.880 --> 41:28.990
My name is Fay Brookstone.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.990
I'm an intern for Solasta financing.

41:32.040 --> 41:35.750
For the last year I've been
helping one of their clients,

41:35.800 --> 41:39.790
Lukas Steiner, hide millions
of pounds in offshore accounts.

41:39.840 --> 41:42.790
On the request of Alistair McDermott.

41:42.840 --> 41:45.030
What's going on?

41:45.080 --> 41:50.590
It's money Steiner made via arms,
drugs, people, anything that paid.

41:50.640 --> 41:54.070
Things didn't really change
for me until I fell for James.

41:54.120 --> 41:58.150
He wasn't like them. He made
me think maybe I wasn't either.

41:58.200 --> 42:01.680
That I didn't have to do it any
more, but more than that...

42:02.880 --> 42:05.280
.. maybe we could stop them from doing it.

42:06.440 --> 42:09.190
So we started to collect
things, record things.

42:09.240 --> 42:12.870
I had enough to bring down
the whole fucking thing.

42:12.920 --> 42:14.990
But Alistair is clever.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.550
And, like always, he was one step ahead.

42:17.600 --> 42:21.390
Once he knew what we were
planning to do, he acted fast.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.190
Just like that,

42:23.240 --> 42:25.640
the whole thing comes
back to me and James.

42:27.680 --> 42:30.830
James made me think that
I was better than that.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.680
That I was stronger.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.320
But he doesn't know everything.

42:38.680 --> 42:40.380
He doesn't know what I've done.

42:43.160 --> 42:47.190
Jude McDermid offers a
bespoke service for us girls.

42:47.240 --> 42:50.830
Our talents are tested so we can
be placed into the right department.

42:50.880 --> 42:54.960
But there's an extra test for you
if you're after client management.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.160
See, that's the special one.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.800
I fucked it all up.

43:06.240 --> 43:07.480
Just like always.

43:08.480 --> 43:09.880
Now I've had enough.

43:12.280 --> 43:14.000
I'm tired.

43:16.280 --> 43:19.880
I want everything to stop.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.400
But the others should know.

43:28.360 --> 43:32.240
The others should know what being
Alistair's top girl really means...

43:33.360 --> 43:34.640
How they make you...

43:36.080 --> 43:37.240
.. compliant.

43:38.800 --> 43:43.320
How they make you feel just like
them, just as bad, just as dirty.

43:47.360 --> 43:49.150
I never told you, James.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.760
I'm so sorry.

43:52.240 --> 43:55.670
I don't think even you could
have loved me, knowing this,

43:55.720 --> 43:57.920
but the others need to know.

44:00.280 --> 44:02.160
Because he'll do it again.

44:03.680 --> 44:05.160
That's the worst part.

44:07.240 --> 44:10.400
I don't think I'm the first, and
the idea of not being the last...

44:11.560 --> 44:13.430
Maybe I can warn people.

44:13.480 --> 44:15.920
Maybe I can do this one thing.

44:17.920 --> 44:19.400
Get out.

44:21.920 --> 44:23.640
Get out before you're me.
