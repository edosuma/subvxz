WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:05.238

So thats the finalized menu
for the wedding.


00:05.270 --> 00:05.839

Mmm.


00:05.871 --> 00:08.641

And here is a list of who


00:08.675 --> 00:10.776

will be walking with whom
down the aisle.


00:10.810 --> 00:13.512

Isnt she amazing?
She drew tiny bodies,


00:13.545 --> 00:16.082

went on Facebook,
got everybodys picture,


00:16.115 --> 00:18.117

and glued their little faces on.


00:19.786 --> 00:22.722

And yet, somehow,
my fantasy football league


00:22.756 --> 00:25.158

is a big waste of time.


00:26.626 --> 00:28.762

This might be a stupid question


00:28.795 --> 00:30.396

considering
who Nicks friends are,


00:30.429 --> 00:32.698

but is there any chance
Im not walking down the aisle


00:32.731 --> 00:34.334

with a total dork?


00:34.366 --> 00:37.302

Youre, uh, youre with Spence.


00:37.337 --> 00:38.771

So is he at least,
like, a hot dork?


00:38.804 --> 00:41.173

Like, what am I dealing
with here? (chuckles)


00:41.207 --> 00:43.509

Spence is
a very good-looking guy.


00:43.542 --> 00:45.744

What am I talking about?
Youre 16 years old.


00:45.779 --> 00:47.679

Just shut up and walk.


00:49.149 --> 00:52.618

Clem, sweetheart,
I created this special page


00:52.652 --> 00:55.854

of you
in your beautiful gown


00:55.889 --> 00:58.158

walking down the aisle
with your father Freddy.


00:58.191 --> 01:00.359

(laughing):
Oh, yeah.


01:00.393 --> 01:03.362

Thats, uh, not happening.


01:03.396 --> 01:05.397

Sorry, Rose,


01:05.432 --> 01:07.867

but he doesnt get to be
a lousy father my whole life


01:07.900 --> 01:10.503

and then swoop in on my wedding
day and give me away.


01:10.537 --> 01:13.272

Besides, he already tried
to give me away once...


01:13.305 --> 01:17.176

to the upstairs neighbors
when I was eight.


01:17.210 --> 01:20.680

The next time Im in a play
and have to cry on cue,


01:20.712 --> 01:22.781

Im gonna use that.


01:22.816 --> 01:24.484

Well, sweetheart,


01:24.516 --> 01:26.552

you better tell Freddy hes
not walking you down the aisle


01:26.585 --> 01:28.754

because Im pretty sure
hes expecting to.


01:28.787 --> 01:31.156

Fine. Ill call him.


01:31.191 --> 01:32.692

Oh, sweetheart,
this isnt something


01:32.724 --> 01:33.926

you want to do
over the phone.


01:33.960 --> 01:37.729

The man ended two marriages
over the phone; hell be fine.


01:39.299 --> 01:40.900

He didnt actually do that,
did he?


01:40.933 --> 01:44.370

Walt, I know our dad seems
like a horrible guy,


01:44.403 --> 01:48.441

but once you get to know him,
hes even worse.


01:49.776 --> 01:51.944

And dont forget, Shannon,
Sunday the bridesmaids


01:51.978 --> 01:53.746

have their fittings
for their gowns.


01:53.780 --> 01:55.914

Ugh. Sorry, Rose, cant.


01:55.948 --> 01:57.884

Me and my peeps are going
to the Electric Feather


01:57.917 --> 02:00.219

Music Festival in Pennsylvania
this weekend.


02:00.253 --> 02:01.921

Excuse me?


02:01.954 --> 02:03.489

I know what youre gonna say:


02:03.522 --> 02:04.891

I cant miss school
Friday and Monday.


02:04.924 --> 02:08.794

But this festival is
a learning experience.


02:08.828 --> 02:12.699

Do you know whats an even
better learning experience?


02:12.731 --> 02:15.435

Having your ass in school.


02:17.002 --> 02:20.840

There is no way youre going
to a music festival, Shannon.


02:20.873 --> 02:23.776

Its 50 acres
of drugs, drinking,


02:23.810 --> 02:25.578

nudity,
and the Dave Matthews Band.


02:25.611 --> 02:26.712

Oh, my God.


02:26.746 --> 02:29.649

Clem, please.


02:29.681 --> 02:32.451

You can trust me.


02:32.485 --> 02:35.454

I will not see the
Dave Matthews Band.


02:37.356 --> 02:39.359

â™ª


02:45.331 --> 02:46.832

Well, thats done.


02:46.865 --> 02:49.668

I told my dad that hes not
walking me down the aisle.


02:49.701 --> 02:50.870

Howd he take it?


02:50.903 --> 02:52.572

He didnt seem to care.


02:52.604 --> 02:54.406

He just asked if any
of my hot friends


02:54.439 --> 02:55.942

would be sitting at his table.


02:57.911 --> 03:00.879

I wish I had a dad who wanted
to be a part of my life.


03:00.913 --> 03:02.782

Well, if he hooks up with one
of your hot friends,


03:02.814 --> 03:04.217

hell be a part of your life.


03:05.485 --> 03:07.887

(laughs) I was trying
to make you laugh.


03:07.920 --> 03:09.588

You dont want to laugh.


03:10.924 --> 03:12.925

(phone buzzing)


03:10.924 --> 03:12.925

Yo, Shannon, your
phones buzzing.


03:12.959 --> 03:14.661

Yeah, I know.
Its Jolene.


03:14.693 --> 03:17.030

Shes been calling for days,
and I dont want to talk to her.


03:17.062 --> 03:17.864

Who is Jolene?


03:17.896 --> 03:19.966

Her mother.
She lives in Arizona.


03:19.998 --> 03:21.768

You call your mom Jolene?


03:21.800 --> 03:23.402

Shes barely my mom.


03:23.436 --> 03:24.871

Shes just the woman
who squeezed me out


03:24.903 --> 03:27.574

while smoking a cigarette in
the break room of an Applebees.


03:28.775 --> 03:30.409

Well, if shes been calling you
for days,


03:30.443 --> 03:31.777

she might have something
important to tell you.


03:31.811 --> 03:32.812

Oh, yeah.


03:32.844 --> 03:34.881

Like shes dead.


03:32.844 --> 03:34.881

(phone buzzing)


03:36.716 --> 03:38.951

Hello.


03:38.985 --> 03:40.453

Damn it.


03:42.622 --> 03:44.890

Ah, Jolene. (sighs)


03:44.924 --> 03:47.460

You know, she was the reason
why I left home at 16.


03:47.492 --> 03:49.329

Shes always
had it out for me.


03:49.361 --> 03:51.663

She once got drunk and made out
with my boyfriend...


03:51.698 --> 03:52.998

at my prom!


03:54.667 --> 03:57.770

Well, thats that.


03:57.804 --> 03:59.472

What did she want?


03:59.504 --> 04:01.039

To tell me shes downstairs.


04:01.074 --> 04:03.876

Seriously?
I know, right?


04:03.909 --> 04:06.079

What kind of a woman drops
by without calling first?


04:06.111 --> 04:08.814

Shes been calling you for days.


04:08.848 --> 04:10.817

(knocking on door)


04:10.849 --> 04:13.786

All right. Lets see
what the woman wants.


04:15.854 --> 04:17.824

Theres my baby.


04:19.024 --> 04:20.759

(sighs)


04:20.793 --> 04:23.730

Shannon. Look at you.


04:23.762 --> 04:24.896

Oh.


04:24.930 --> 04:28.100

Youve become
such a woman.


04:28.134 --> 04:31.803

My eyes are up here,
Jolene.


04:32.971 --> 04:33.673

Clem.


04:33.706 --> 04:35.774

Jolene.


04:36.776 --> 04:38.076

(gasps) Oh. Okay.


04:38.110 --> 04:40.812

And were hugging now.


04:40.846 --> 04:46.019

Oh. And who is this
stunning creature?


04:46.052 --> 04:48.887

(giggles)
Im Nick.


04:48.920 --> 04:49.889

(laughs)


04:49.922 --> 04:50.822

Clems fiancÃ©.


04:50.856 --> 04:51.757

JOLENE:
Well,


04:51.790 --> 04:54.427

you are a saint for
taking this one in.


04:54.459 --> 04:56.428

Nah. No.
I love Shannon.


04:56.461 --> 04:58.598

(laughs) I was talking
about Clem, silly.


04:58.630 --> 04:59.798

(whoops)


04:59.831 --> 05:01.500

(laughter)


05:01.533 --> 05:05.605

Oh, sweetie, its been forever.


05:05.637 --> 05:06.838

What have I missed?


05:06.872 --> 05:08.908

Oh, nothing. Just
three birthdays,


05:08.940 --> 05:10.410

puberty, adolescence.


05:10.442 --> 05:12.444

No biggie.


05:12.478 --> 05:16.649

Let me guess. Youre still mad
at me for abandoning you.


05:16.682 --> 05:18.651

And you should be.


05:18.685 --> 05:21.721

But Im a different person now,
and its all...


05:21.754 --> 05:23.456

its all because of Harold.


05:23.488 --> 05:24.790

Harold?


05:24.824 --> 05:26.793

I got married again.


05:26.826 --> 05:30.730

And for the first time
in my life, Im in love.


05:30.762 --> 05:32.798

More than with Steve Epstein
from my prom?


05:32.831 --> 05:35.168

Who?


05:35.201 --> 05:38.004

Oh, right.
No, that kid was amazing.


05:39.038 --> 05:41.941

But hes got nothing
on this guy, huh?


05:41.973 --> 05:43.475

Hey-oh! (laughs)


05:43.509 --> 05:46.713

Okay, Im, uh,
Im sensing a pattern here


05:46.745 --> 05:49.749

that Im very uncomfortable
with.


05:49.781 --> 05:52.685

Sweetheart, I cant wait
for you to meet Harold.


05:52.718 --> 05:54.052

Hes such
an incredible person.


05:54.086 --> 05:57.023

Hes so wise and generous.


05:57.055 --> 05:58.957

So hes old and loaded.


06:00.892 --> 06:02.995

Yeah. Little bit.
Little bit.


06:04.197 --> 06:06.531

Okay, cool.
Well, congratulations, Jolene.


06:06.565 --> 06:07.966

Its been great.


06:06.565 --> 06:07.966

Honey, honey, honey.


06:08.000 --> 06:09.435

Im only in town
for the weekend.


06:09.468 --> 06:10.670

Lets do something
fun, huh?


06:10.702 --> 06:12.105

I mean, do-do you
have any plans?


06:12.137 --> 06:14.206

Not anymore.
I was gonna go


06:14.240 --> 06:15.440

to the Electric Feather
Music Festival,


06:15.475 --> 06:16.442

but these two wont let me.


06:16.475 --> 06:18.577

She wanted to drive all the way
to Pennsylvania


06:18.610 --> 06:20.846

with a couple of girlfriends,
completely unsupervised


06:20.879 --> 06:23.014

for four days
doing who knows what.


06:23.048 --> 06:24.951

I know what.
I did what.


06:24.983 --> 06:27.754

Which is why were not gonna
let her do what.


06:29.055 --> 06:31.790

Well, if you ask me, I say
let her have some fun.


06:31.824 --> 06:34.026

I mean, youre only
16 once, right?


06:34.060 --> 06:36.862

Yes, but wed also like her
to be 17 once.


06:36.896 --> 06:40.800

Well, Im her mom,
and I say she can go.


06:40.832 --> 06:42.968

SHANNON:
Wait, what? I can go?


06:43.002 --> 06:44.870

Mm-hmm.
For real.


06:44.903 --> 06:45.737

N-N-N-N-No.


06:45.771 --> 06:48.240

Youre living with us,
we make the rules.


06:48.274 --> 06:50.543

Well, maybe soon shell
be living someplace else.


06:50.576 --> 06:51.810

What is that supposed to mean?


06:51.843 --> 06:52.879

All right, honey,
come here.


06:52.911 --> 06:55.981

Shanny, I wanted to wait
until the end of the weekend


06:56.014 --> 06:57.216

to talk to you about this,


06:57.250 --> 07:00.119

but the reason why
I came to town is,


07:00.153 --> 07:02.521

I want you to come
live with me now.


07:02.555 --> 07:04.891

In Arizona?


07:04.923 --> 07:06.759

Wait a second.
You really think


07:06.793 --> 07:09.528

you can abandon your daughter
and then suddenly waltz


07:09.562 --> 07:12.264

back into her life and expect
her to jump into your arms?


07:12.298 --> 07:14.100

That was the plan, yeah.


07:15.867 --> 07:17.769

Look, you dont need
to live with your sister.


07:17.803 --> 07:19.504

And like this?


07:21.540 --> 07:22.774

Wait till you see
our house.


07:22.809 --> 07:24.810

Oh, my God,
you can ride up and down


07:24.843 --> 07:26.211

in Harolds stair lift.


07:26.245 --> 07:28.581

Its so fun.


07:29.749 --> 07:33.886

Wait. So I wouldnt
have to walk up stairs?


07:33.920 --> 07:36.689

Okay, Shannon, thats not a
reason to move to Arizona.


07:36.721 --> 07:38.824

Yeah, but living
with her mother is.


07:38.858 --> 07:41.593

All right, you know what?
Dont decide now.


07:41.627 --> 07:43.629

You take some time
to think about it


07:43.663 --> 07:46.899

while we go shopping


07:46.932 --> 07:49.802

for a new outfit
for the music festival.


07:49.836 --> 07:52.237

Youre taking me
to Electric Feather?


07:52.271 --> 07:54.040

Yeah, girl.


07:55.274 --> 07:57.810

Oh, dont worry. Clem,
Im gonna hire a driver.


07:57.843 --> 08:00.079

That way we can drink
and not worry about driving.


08:00.112 --> 08:02.014

Its not the driving
that Im worried about,


08:02.048 --> 08:03.149

its the drinking.


08:03.182 --> 08:05.218

Not the driving,
the drinking.


08:05.250 --> 08:08.321

Geez. When did she become
such a worrywart?


08:08.353 --> 08:10.990

(giggles)


08:11.023 --> 08:13.759

Sorry. I thought you were gonna
smack me on my butt.


08:13.793 --> 08:15.961

You thought right.


08:17.362 --> 08:19.098

Come on, Shanny.
Lets go shopping.


08:19.130 --> 08:20.332

Bye.


08:20.365 --> 08:22.134

Wait. Shannon.


08:22.168 --> 08:24.136

Dont let Jolene
talk you into anything.


08:24.170 --> 08:26.805

Of course not. Dude,
that woman is the worst.


08:26.838 --> 08:31.009

But Shanny needs to see
her some Kendrick Lamar.


08:31.043 --> 08:32.544

Bye.


08:40.019 --> 08:42.087

Why isnt Shannon back
from the festival yet?


08:42.120 --> 08:44.056

Every hour that goes by
is another hour


08:44.090 --> 08:46.625

that Jolene can use to talk her
into moving to Arizona.


08:47.860 --> 08:49.061

What up, kids?


08:49.095 --> 08:51.062

Shannon. Hey.


08:51.096 --> 08:53.099

How was
the music festival?


08:53.131 --> 08:55.033

(laughs) So dope.


08:55.067 --> 08:57.903

Dude, Jolene can party.


08:57.937 --> 09:01.374

She said theres another
festival next month in Phoenix,


09:01.407 --> 09:04.243

and we can get
backstage passes.


09:04.277 --> 09:07.812

Wait. I thought you were just
using her for the festival.


09:07.846 --> 09:10.216

Well, I mean,
I was, but...


09:10.249 --> 09:11.884

its the first time
I actually got


09:11.918 --> 09:13.085

to spend quality
time with her.


09:13.119 --> 09:14.820

Well, Im gonna
go to sleep.


09:14.854 --> 09:16.655

I havent slept
in two days.


09:16.688 --> 09:18.823

And, Clem,
dont worry.


09:18.857 --> 09:21.159

I did not see the
Dave Matthews Band.


09:24.397 --> 09:26.197

Shes gonna go live with Jolene.


09:26.231 --> 09:27.365

No way, babe.


09:27.399 --> 09:28.900

We are not gonna let
that happen.


09:28.934 --> 09:29.835

What can we do, Nick?


09:29.869 --> 09:31.836

Jolene is her real mom.


09:31.870 --> 09:33.739

Well, look,
there is someone


09:33.773 --> 09:36.741

who has just as much a say
about the situation as Jolene.


09:36.775 --> 09:38.311

Is it God?


09:40.111 --> 09:42.380

Very much the opposite.


09:42.414 --> 09:44.317

My dad?


09:44.350 --> 09:45.850

Yeah.


09:45.884 --> 09:47.052

(whining): No.


09:54.293 --> 09:55.827

Hey, Dad.
Can I come in?


09:55.860 --> 09:57.296

Sure. Watching hockey.


09:57.330 --> 09:58.764

Grab a beer.


09:58.798 --> 09:59.932

I assume you dont want me


09:59.966 --> 10:02.033

to walk you to the refrigerator.


10:03.068 --> 10:04.836

I thought you didnt care.


10:04.870 --> 10:07.273

I dont.


10:07.306 --> 10:08.874

Wait a second.


10:08.908 --> 10:10.942

Whats that smell?


10:10.976 --> 10:13.678

I dont know
what youre...
Dont move.


10:14.480 --> 10:16.682

(sniffing)


10:18.384 --> 10:20.352

Jolene.


10:20.385 --> 10:22.053

(sighs)


10:22.087 --> 10:24.255

Damn it, I was wearing this
when she hugged me.


10:24.289 --> 10:27.893

I really like this jacket
and now I have to burn it.


10:27.927 --> 10:32.097

So, my least favorite
ex-wife is in town, huh?


10:32.130 --> 10:32.932

That woman is


10:32.965 --> 10:35.033

a monster from hell.


10:35.067 --> 10:37.036

Hows she look?


10:37.068 --> 10:40.306

Disgustingly fantastic.


10:40.338 --> 10:43.308

When she left, she took me
for everything I had,


10:43.341 --> 10:44.976

and I didnt have much.


10:45.010 --> 10:47.013

God, I hate that woman.


10:48.014 --> 10:50.015

Was she wearing boots?


10:51.049 --> 10:53.885

Listen, Ive got
a serious problem.


10:53.918 --> 10:55.721

Shes trying
to take Shannon away from me.


10:55.754 --> 10:57.023

Ooh, power play.


10:57.056 --> 10:59.325

I know, right? She wants
to move her to Arizona.


10:59.357 --> 11:00.192

I meant the game.


11:00.225 --> 11:02.461

The Rangers have a
two-man advantage.


11:02.495 --> 11:05.931

But your thing is also
very interesting.


11:05.965 --> 11:09.134

Jolenes only doing this
because she hates me.


11:09.168 --> 11:11.003

And you know that shes not
a good parent for Shannon.


11:11.037 --> 11:13.405

Please, Dad,
will you talk to her?


11:13.438 --> 11:15.041

Hey, you have to
make up your mind.


11:15.073 --> 11:17.243

Am I a guy that you
come to for help,


11:17.275 --> 11:20.346

or a useless jerk that you
dont want in your life?


11:20.379 --> 11:22.248

Cant you be both?


11:28.120 --> 11:29.321

Freddy.


11:29.355 --> 11:30.889

What are you doing here?


11:30.923 --> 11:33.491

Hello, Red.


11:39.030 --> 11:41.067

(sighs)


11:42.334 --> 11:44.302

Is that a gun
in your pocket?


11:45.336 --> 11:47.306

Oh, yeah.


11:47.338 --> 11:49.975

Sorry.


11:50.009 --> 11:52.278

Look, uh, we need
to talk about Shannon.


11:52.311 --> 11:55.081

I hear you want to move her
to Arizona with you,


11:55.114 --> 11:57.349

and Im here to tell you
that aint gonna happen.


11:57.383 --> 11:58.984

Did Clem send you?


11:59.018 --> 12:01.352

No, Clem didnt send me.
I sent myself.


12:02.922 --> 12:05.124

After briefly speaking with Clem


12:05.157 --> 12:06.558

on an unrelated matter.


12:06.591 --> 12:08.059

Why should she stay here?


12:08.094 --> 12:10.162

I mean, I can buy her
anything she wants.


12:10.196 --> 12:12.197

Freddy, Im loaded now.


12:13.532 --> 12:17.436

I got two jaguars, only
one of which is a car.


12:17.470 --> 12:20.072

Listen.


12:20.105 --> 12:23.042

Im the father,
and you cant move her


12:23.075 --> 12:25.009

to Arizona
without my permission.


12:29.148 --> 12:31.116

What are you doing?


12:31.149 --> 12:33.418

Nothing. Its just
a little warm in here.


12:33.451 --> 12:35.488

No, no, no, no, no.
I know what youre doing,


12:35.520 --> 12:36.855

and it aint gonna work.


12:36.889 --> 12:38.490

You... you put that


12:38.524 --> 12:40.926

milky white shoulder away.


12:42.260 --> 12:44.230

You like that?


12:44.263 --> 12:46.465

Well, say hello to
her little friend.


12:48.334 --> 12:52.337

Oh... the girls look good.


12:52.370 --> 12:54.340

Come on, Freddy.


12:54.373 --> 12:56.609

You know you missed me.


12:56.642 --> 12:59.110

I hate you.


13:03.481 --> 13:05.451

Wait a second.


13:05.484 --> 13:07.186

Didnt you just get married?


13:07.219 --> 13:09.053

Yeah, but Harolds
thing doesnt work.


13:09.087 --> 13:11.090

We cant have that.


13:13.325 --> 13:15.494

My dads here.
I really hope


13:15.528 --> 13:18.129

he stuck it to Jolene.


13:18.163 --> 13:22.301

Oh, I am sure
Freddy gave it to her good.


13:22.333 --> 13:24.937

(knocking)


13:24.970 --> 13:26.004

Hey, Dad.


13:24.970 --> 13:26.004

Hey.


13:26.038 --> 13:28.039

Did you lay down the law?


13:30.341 --> 13:34.513

I mean, we definitely got
something straight between us.


13:34.547 --> 13:37.182

Thank you.
Hey, Shannon!


13:37.216 --> 13:38.484

No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.


13:38.517 --> 13:40.418

Hold on, hold on.


13:38.517 --> 13:40.418

What up?


13:40.451 --> 13:42.488

Oh. Hi, Dad.


13:42.520 --> 13:44.889

Hi.


13:42.520 --> 13:44.889

Dad wants to talk to
you about something.


13:44.923 --> 13:45.957

Go ahead, Dad.


13:45.990 --> 13:47.459

FREDDY:
Uh, look, I just had


13:47.493 --> 13:49.495

an interesting talk
with your mother.


13:49.528 --> 13:52.932

We started off in
different positions.


13:55.167 --> 13:58.169

But in the end,
we came together.


14:02.307 --> 14:04.275

And, uh, we decided


14:04.309 --> 14:07.679

that, uh, if you want to
move, its your choice.


14:07.712 --> 14:09.215

What?!


14:10.481 --> 14:12.418

So youre saying
its totally up to me?


14:12.451 --> 14:14.320

Yup. Yeah, it was
your mothers idea,


14:14.352 --> 14:16.956

but, uh, I got behind
her pretty quick.


14:18.490 --> 14:20.058

Youre not gonna go, are you?


14:21.961 --> 14:23.928

Look, you guys
have been awesome,


14:23.962 --> 14:26.298

and I totally appreciate
everything youve done for me.


14:26.331 --> 14:28.067

You guys,
shes my mom.


14:28.100 --> 14:30.970

And I really feel like
I should give this a shot.


14:31.003 --> 14:33.304

Is that really what you want?


14:33.338 --> 14:38.043

Yeah, I mean, what would you do
if your mom came back for you?


14:39.577 --> 14:42.047

(ringtone plays)


14:42.081 --> 14:44.015

Got to go.
Jolenes here.


14:44.048 --> 14:45.149

Were getting massages.


14:45.183 --> 14:46.585

(laughs)


14:47.586 --> 14:48.988

See you later.


14:49.020 --> 14:51.023

(door closes)


14:51.056 --> 14:53.125

What the hell happened, Dad?!


14:53.158 --> 14:57.328

Look, I know I didnt follow
the plan exactly.


14:57.363 --> 15:00.466

It sounds like you didnt
follow the plan at all.


15:00.499 --> 15:03.402

Clem said go to the hotel
and talk to Jolene.


15:03.434 --> 15:05.169

I did both those things!


15:05.203 --> 15:09.341

But Jolene made
some... compelling points.


15:09.375 --> 15:12.311

Oh, my God.
You slept with her.


15:12.344 --> 15:15.480

Why do you always
assume the worst?


15:17.081 --> 15:20.985

But in this case,
yes, you nailed it.


15:21.019 --> 15:24.123

You dont care what happens
to Shannon, do you?


15:24.155 --> 15:26.991

You dont care about anything
when it comes to your kids.


15:27.025 --> 15:30.028

Well, all right, then, if thats
how you feel, Ill just go.


15:30.062 --> 15:32.530

Yeah, that is
how I feel. Go!


15:37.735 --> 15:40.038

(door closes)


15:42.073 --> 15:44.043

Look, Im sorry, babe.


15:44.076 --> 15:46.110

You did everything
you could.


15:46.144 --> 15:50.115

I cant believe
Shannons gonna leave us.


15:50.149 --> 15:53.686

Oh, look, Nick.


15:53.719 --> 15:55.120

Its her sweater.


15:55.153 --> 15:57.121

(sniffing)


15:57.155 --> 15:59.991

(voice breaking):
It smells like McNuggets
and weed.


16:07.231 --> 16:09.802

I got us a couple
of post-massage mimosas.


16:09.835 --> 16:13.238

I told them
they were both for me. Shh.


16:13.272 --> 16:15.506

Jolene,
how are you still drinking?


16:15.541 --> 16:17.643

Im so hungover
from this weekend.


16:17.676 --> 16:20.312

When you come to Arizona, its
gonna be like this all the time.


16:20.346 --> 16:23.514

Beefy women jamming their elbows
in my ass?


16:23.548 --> 16:25.350

No, I mean the partying.


16:25.384 --> 16:28.153

And the best part--
its gonna be just you and me.


16:28.187 --> 16:29.620

What about Harold?


16:29.654 --> 16:31.623

Mm. Dont worry about him.


16:31.657 --> 16:33.491

His nurse puts him to bed
at 6:30,


16:33.524 --> 16:35.827

so the nights are ours.


16:35.860 --> 16:38.529

FREDDY:
Hey, I dont care


16:38.563 --> 16:41.100

if this is the ladies area.
Im a cop!


16:41.133 --> 16:42.500

Hey there, pumpkin.


16:42.533 --> 16:44.269

Freddy, what the hell
are you doing here?


16:44.302 --> 16:45.770

How did you even know
where we were?


16:45.803 --> 16:47.673

You know that thing
where a cop needs a warrant


16:47.706 --> 16:48.539

to track your cell phone?


16:48.573 --> 16:50.308

Well, I dont care
about that thing.


16:51.677 --> 16:53.144

Shannon, we
need to talk.


16:53.177 --> 16:55.213

If this is about
her moving in with me,


16:55.246 --> 16:56.381

its none of your business.


16:56.414 --> 16:58.716

Hey, shes my daughter
as much as yours.


16:58.750 --> 17:00.119

What do you want, Dad?


17:00.152 --> 17:01.386

Listen to me, Shannon.


17:01.419 --> 17:03.721

Moving in with this
woman is a huge mistake,


17:03.755 --> 17:05.324

and I say that as someone


17:05.356 --> 17:07.759

who made a huge mistake
moving in with this woman.


17:07.792 --> 17:10.828

Freddy, get the hell
out of here, okay?


17:10.863 --> 17:14.098

Your Axe body spray is
drowning out the eucalyptus.


17:15.666 --> 17:19.771

Look, Clem may not always be
the most fun, or any fun at all.


17:21.240 --> 17:23.307

Okay, shes the
death of fun.


17:23.342 --> 17:26.244

But shes a good person
with good judgment.


17:26.278 --> 17:27.779

Unlike this woman,
who is terrible.


17:27.813 --> 17:30.281

Hey, youre also terrible.


17:30.315 --> 17:32.785

No one is arguing with that!


17:32.817 --> 17:35.186

Shannon, if you move in with me,


17:35.220 --> 17:37.789

I promise I wont tell you
how to live your life.


17:37.823 --> 17:39.657

Come on. Its gonna be
one non-stop party.


17:39.691 --> 17:40.826

Well be like sisters.


17:40.858 --> 17:42.461

Shannon, thats
the problem.


17:42.493 --> 17:44.695

You dont need a mom
whos like a sister.


17:44.730 --> 17:46.330

You need a sister
whos like a mom.


17:46.365 --> 17:48.299

And thats what
youve got.


17:48.333 --> 17:50.201

Okay, can somebody please
escort this man


17:50.234 --> 17:52.270

out of the ladies area?


17:52.304 --> 17:55.339

Hey, you didnt mind having me
in


17:52.304 --> 17:55.339

<i>your</i>


17:52.304 --> 17:55.339

ladys area last night.


17:57.608 --> 18:01.313

Ew. I heard that.


18:01.346 --> 18:04.782

And Im going, but
think about what I said.


18:05.917 --> 18:08.319

Some five-star hotel.


18:08.353 --> 18:10.355

Theres salad in the water.


18:12.758 --> 18:14.692

What an idiot, right?


18:14.726 --> 18:16.728

Yeah. (laughs)


18:22.800 --> 18:25.604

Babe, the house is gonna feel
so empty without Shannon.


18:25.636 --> 18:28.874

Whos gonna make fun
of how I dress when shes gone?


18:28.906 --> 18:32.277

Youre sweater is super dumb.


18:33.311 --> 18:34.846

Nah, its not the same.


18:34.880 --> 18:36.914

Its sweet of you to try,
though.


18:39.951 --> 18:41.185

Shannon.
Hey, Clem.


18:41.220 --> 18:43.622

Mr. Rogers.


18:43.654 --> 18:45.523

Yup, there it is.


18:45.557 --> 18:46.858

Im gonna miss that.


18:48.594 --> 18:49.862

Well, you wont have to,
cause Im staying.


18:49.894 --> 18:50.863

CLEM:
You are?!


18:50.895 --> 18:52.263

Really?


18:50.895 --> 18:52.263

What happened?


18:52.297 --> 18:55.467

Well, I realized
you guys need me. (chuckles)


18:57.368 --> 18:58.703

And also, this
might sound crazy,


18:58.737 --> 19:00.806

but I cannot keep
up with Jolene.


19:00.838 --> 19:03.241

I honestly think that
Phoenix would have killed me.


19:03.275 --> 19:06.444

And I really do want
to live to see 17 once.


19:06.478 --> 19:10.348

Oh, were so happy
that youre staying, Shannon.


19:10.382 --> 19:12.617

Cool.


19:12.651 --> 19:15.420

Now, if you dont mind, Im
gonna Postmates some McNuggets


19:15.453 --> 19:16.954

and retire for the evening.


19:16.989 --> 19:18.923

Shannon...


19:16.989 --> 19:18.923

Oh, dont worry.


19:18.957 --> 19:19.991

Ill put a towel under the door


19:20.025 --> 19:23.662

so you dont have to smell
the... the McNuggets.


19:31.636 --> 19:34.940

(knocking)


19:34.972 --> 19:36.942

Geez, twice in one week.


19:36.974 --> 19:39.310

Do I need a restraining order?


19:40.345 --> 19:41.547

Actually, Dad,


19:41.579 --> 19:42.780

in normal families,


19:42.814 --> 19:44.883

people see their parents
on a regular basis.


19:44.916 --> 19:47.653

No.


19:47.685 --> 19:52.257

Look, I just came here
to say three words


19:52.290 --> 19:55.426

that I never thought
I would say before, but...


19:55.460 --> 19:56.929

thank you, Dad.


19:56.961 --> 19:58.297

Thanks for what?


19:58.329 --> 20:00.499

Shannons not gonna live
with Jolene,


20:00.531 --> 20:03.268

and I know its because you went
to the spa and talked to her.


20:03.301 --> 20:05.304

Oh, please.
What gave you that idea?


20:07.940 --> 20:11.309

Well, first of all, you clearly
stole that robe from the spa.


20:11.343 --> 20:13.045

This? No.


20:13.077 --> 20:16.582

I bought it last time I
went in for a seaweed wrap.


20:16.615 --> 20:18.416

Youre getting seaweed wraps?


20:18.450 --> 20:20.484

You cant afford
to pay your phone bill.


20:20.519 --> 20:24.323

Because Im prioritizing
the seaweed wraps.


20:24.355 --> 20:27.593

Okay, look, I know
that you dont care


20:27.625 --> 20:29.461

about this kind of thing,


20:29.493 --> 20:33.832

but if you want to walk me
down the aisle, you can.
