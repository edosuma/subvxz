PHIL: <i>Previously
on The Amazing Race,</i>

00:04.360 --> 00:06.959
<i>Nine teams raced to Geneva,
Switzerland.</i>

00:06.960 --> 00:07.960
<i>Love was in the air.</i>

00:07.961 --> 00:11.439
Blair plus Brodie equals Blodie.
-Blodie.

00:11.440 --> 00:14.599
<i>At the Detour,
teams needed accuracy...</i>

00:14.600 --> 00:16.799
So just remember your numbers, OK?
It's all you've got to worry about.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.159
<i>..or a steady hand.</i>

00:19.160 --> 00:20.999
Cut off the things.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.359
Oh, that's why everything is weird.

00:22.360 --> 00:25.039
<i>Teams partnered up
at a United Nations Road Block...</i>

00:25.040 --> 00:27.319
Slow and steady.
Work together, boys! Work together.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.519
Do you know flags?
-I know flags pretty well.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.319
<i>..leaving Jessica in the cold.</i>

00:31.320 --> 00:32.839
It's not that I think
no-one will work with me,

00:32.840 --> 00:34.399
it's that I know
no-one will work with me.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.159
<i>Taking a train to Chamonix

00:37.160 --> 00:38.789

00:38.790 --> 00:41.959
Whoever runs the fastest
without falling in the snow

00:41.960 --> 00:43.439
is going to get there first.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.279
<i>When the snow settled,
Brodie and Kurt won the leg.</i>

00:46.280 --> 00:47.839
(CHEERING)

00:47.840 --> 00:49.839
<i>And Brittany and Jessica
came in last.</i>

00:49.840 --> 00:51.039
I'm sorry to tell you

00:51.040 --> 00:52.719
that you have been eliminated
from the race.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.839

It's Christmas!
-Oh, my God, yes!

01:58.947 --> 02:00.546
(EXCITEDLY) Ah!

02:00.547 --> 02:03.146
We're going to be so cute
on the mountain.

02:03.147 --> 02:04.346
Wardrobe change!

02:04.347 --> 02:08.306
Let's go!

02:08.306 --> 02:09.586
Excuse me.

02:09.586 --> 02:11.026
We're taking it back
a couple of decades.

02:11.026 --> 02:13.306
I've got Hammer pants,

02:13.307 --> 02:15.146
running man action.

02:15.147 --> 02:16.986
Did I get this big?

02:16.987 --> 02:19.706
Brodie! That ass!

02:19.707 --> 02:21.546
Dude, it is sticking out there.

02:21.547 --> 02:22.936
What's up, ladies?

02:22.937 --> 02:24.377
Ay, ay, ay!

02:25.427 --> 02:27.586
"Get your license to drive."

02:27.587 --> 02:29.816
PHIL: <i>Teams must search
the streets of Chamonix</i>

02:29.817 --> 02:32.146
<i>for a car with one
of these license plates.</i>

02:32.147 --> 02:33.266
<i>And then travel in that car</i>

02:33.267 --> 02:35.586
<i>to Les Grands Montets
Gondola Station</i>

02:35.587 --> 02:36.626

02:36.627 --> 02:38.866
Does it say anything
about what the car is?

02:38.867 --> 02:40.666
No.
-Alright. So we just have to run

02:40.667 --> 02:42.706
and find it?
-Yeah.

02:42.707 --> 02:43.707
We've got to go quick.

02:43.708 --> 02:45.306
We've got to stay number one.

02:45.307 --> 02:46.626
BRODIE: We definitely both know

02:46.627 --> 02:48.346
that Tyler and Korey
are very, very good.

02:48.347 --> 02:49.946
We've been definitely battling
back and forth

02:49.947 --> 02:51.106
the last couple of legs.

02:51.107 --> 02:52.826
KURT: The team that's going
to limit their mistakes

02:52.827 --> 02:54.506
is going to be in the best chance
to win.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.826
These are the licence
plates on these.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.626
They all start with DS.

02:57.627 --> 02:59.306
They went this way.

02:59.307 --> 03:01.506
So they all start in DS.

03:01.507 --> 03:03.746
Wow! This is unbelievable.

03:03.747 --> 03:05.826
Here you go. DS 141 GG.

03:05.827 --> 03:07.666
Boom! There's us.
-Boom. Let's go.

03:07.667 --> 03:09.466
We've got to go to the gondola, sir.

03:09.467 --> 03:10.706
OK. What am I looking for?

03:10.707 --> 03:13.106
DS 23 KR. This is one. This is one.

03:13.107 --> 03:14.107
We're in front right now.

03:14.108 --> 03:16.666
We've got to stay in front
of all the other teams behind us.

03:16.667 --> 03:19.586
We've been going from second place
to first place,

03:19.587 --> 03:21.146
second place, second place.

03:21.147 --> 03:22.866
We are due for another first place.

03:22.867 --> 03:25.026
Brodie and Kurt,
we need to beat them.

03:25.027 --> 03:26.387
That's what we're doing today.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.666
They're all DS start, babe.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.066
DS?
-Look for a DS at the beginning.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.906
DANA: The race is, like,
a completely different animal

03:33.907 --> 03:35.026
than anything we've ever done.

03:35.027 --> 03:37.266
So to see that we are staying
towards the top

03:37.267 --> 03:38.706
and we really are a good team,

03:38.707 --> 03:41.466
aside from what we're comfortable
doing, which is dance,

03:41.467 --> 03:44.746
it's really cool to see,
so we're got to keep that going.

03:44.747 --> 03:49.306
DS, here's something, 526 KR?
-Yeah, that's one, that's one.

03:49.307 --> 03:51.066
Should we go down this way?
Nobody else went this way.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.306
Here?
-Yeah.

03:52.307 --> 03:54.146
Down the main road?
-Yeah, you want to do it?

03:54.147 --> 03:55.586
Sure, let's go.

03:55.587 --> 03:56.946
640 KR, that's us.

03:56.947 --> 03:58.826
Monsieur!
We're going to the gondola.

03:58.827 --> 04:00.187
Yeah.
-Oui. OK.

04:01.827 --> 04:04.306
We've got driver Ben, crushing it!

04:04.307 --> 04:05.946
Whoo-woop!
Oh, right, here, dude, right here.

04:05.947 --> 04:08.426
Oh, yeah! Yeah, Ben!
-You're so good, Ben.

04:08.427 --> 04:10.066
You see it?
-Yeah, yeah.

04:10.067 --> 04:11.866
Route info, route info.

04:11.867 --> 04:14.466
Mont Blanc is known
as the White Mountain

04:14.467 --> 04:16.906
because it's covered in snow
all year round.

04:16.906 --> 04:20.106
At 15,771 feet,

04:20.107 --> 04:23.306
it is the highest mountain
in Central Europe.

04:23.307 --> 04:26.866
<i>Teams must now ascend
nearly 11,000 feet</i>

04:26.867 --> 04:29.986
<i>into the shadow of Mont Blanc
to Les Grands Montets,</i>

04:29.987 --> 04:31.626
<i>where they'll battle the thin air</i>

04:31.627 --> 04:34.746
<i>and sudden weather changes
to get their next clue,</i>

04:34.747 --> 04:37.746
<i>precariously perched on the edge
of this icy mountain.</i>

04:37.747 --> 04:39.826
Alright,
who's the best mountain guide here?

04:39.827 --> 04:41.106
Oh!
-Oh!

04:41.107 --> 04:42.696
(BOTH CHEER)

04:42.697 --> 04:45.786
The chemistry is so real right now!

04:45.787 --> 04:47.266
It's right up there.

04:47.267 --> 04:48.586
Alright, do not eat our baguettes.

04:48.587 --> 04:50.546
Don't eat it?
-Do not eat them. Do not eat them.

04:50.547 --> 04:51.896
Well, I'm hungry, dude.

04:51.897 --> 04:53.306
Hi, boys.
-Hey, Korey.

04:53.307 --> 04:56.696
Tyler and Korey,
right behind us as usual.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.506
We need a guide.
Choose a mountain guide.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.266
I was like, "Oh, my God."

05:01.267 --> 05:04.346
When in France,
find yourself cute mountain guide.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.626
Oh, my God.
-We're with you.

05:06.627 --> 05:08.466
So is this ours?
-This is all ours, right?

05:08.467 --> 05:09.746
We've got our climbing gear.

05:09.747 --> 05:11.466
So we've picked our guide,
we've got our bread.

05:11.467 --> 05:13.427
Let's go.
Whoo!

05:14.467 --> 05:15.696
(LAUGHS)

05:15.697 --> 05:17.426
Oh, yeah, let's get to the top!

05:17.427 --> 05:18.826
Yeah.

05:18.827 --> 05:20.626
Just two teams?
-Only to on this one?

05:20.627 --> 05:22.946
Yeah, just two.
Good thing we were one-two.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.107
So we have to wait for the next one
with Dana and Matt.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.826
Look at that nightmare.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.576
Look at that.
Nightmare, pure nightmare.

05:29.577 --> 05:31.576
Never ever happens to me, I swear.

05:31.577 --> 05:33.506
It's the first time ever
with a baguette doing that.

05:33.507 --> 05:34.507
Yeah, right.

05:36.147 --> 05:37.187
Excuses, excuses.

05:38.467 --> 05:40.906
What's that snow movie
where they eat each other?

05:40.907 --> 05:42.306
"Alive".

05:42.307 --> 05:44.506
We all agree to eat Tyler first,
right?

05:44.507 --> 05:46.026
Why would you eat me?

05:46.027 --> 05:47.586
(LAUGHTER)

05:47.587 --> 05:48.587
Easiest to cook.

05:48.588 --> 05:49.706
Tender.
-Tender?

05:49.707 --> 05:50.826
Yeah, you would take so fast.

05:50.827 --> 05:52.106
Are you calling me tender?

05:52.107 --> 05:54.746
I would take, like, five hours
to cook before you could eat me.

05:54.747 --> 05:55.866
Yeah, but there's so much to eat.

05:55.867 --> 05:56.867
Oh, my God.

05:56.868 --> 05:58.627
Is that where we start from,
down there?

06:00.347 --> 06:02.026
Open it, Momma!

06:02.027 --> 06:05.546
SHERI: Really most of these legs,
Cole has been doing everything.

06:05.547 --> 06:07.746
Oh, crap!
I don't like mountain equipment!

06:07.747 --> 06:10.146
SHERI: So being a stay-at-home mom,
I want to show my family

06:10.147 --> 06:12.906
that I can still go out
and I can still do these things.

06:12.907 --> 06:16.587
So maybe it's time to go ahead
and push myself and just do it.

06:17.587 --> 06:19.866
"Gear up. Pick up mountain equipment
and baguettes." What?!

06:19.867 --> 06:21.826
Wow! Look at that little church.

06:21.827 --> 06:24.307
Oh, my gosh, Daddy!
I could get married there.

06:25.347 --> 06:28.266
If your boyfriend's all squared up,
you'll be set.

06:28.267 --> 06:29.906
Or friend.

06:29.907 --> 06:31.186
(MUMBLES INCOHERENTLY)

06:31.187 --> 06:32.826
I was just saying.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.826
Oh, daddy, the clue!

06:34.827 --> 06:36.386
We've got to gear up.

06:36.387 --> 06:38.386
There's only one other team missing.

06:38.387 --> 06:40.426
Let's see.
-Here.

06:40.427 --> 06:41.506
Oh, there?

06:41.507 --> 06:43.866
(YELPS)
Oh, Erin, are you OK?

06:43.867 --> 06:45.506
Arggh!

06:45.507 --> 06:47.306
ERIN: We want to move up today
for sure.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.786
But seeing the world like this
is just...

06:48.787 --> 06:50.226
..incredible.
-Unreal.

06:50.227 --> 06:52.906
Really, the $1 million is just
like the cherry on top for us.

06:52.907 --> 06:54.626
Oh, is that the Clue Box?
-Right here.

06:54.627 --> 06:56.386
Oh!
-Duh! We're such idiots.

06:56.387 --> 06:57.387
Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my gosh.

06:59.227 --> 07:01.266
This is crazy.

07:01.267 --> 07:02.866
Do we come up as well?

07:02.867 --> 07:04.826
Do you guys have a mountain guide?
-Huh?

07:04.827 --> 07:07.226
Everyone has to pick one individually.
-Oh. Oh, OK. That's great.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.587
We didn't pick our mountain guide.
Oh, man.

07:12.467 --> 07:16.706
MEN: Whoa!

07:16.707 --> 07:19.867
Oh, my God.
-OK. OK.

07:20.987 --> 07:23.066
Just a couple of jocks zip-lining.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.306
Just a couple of jocks.
Just four jocks.

07:25.307 --> 07:27.026
Just dudes being bros.

07:27.027 --> 07:29.106
Bros being dudes.
-Just dudes being bros.

07:29.107 --> 07:30.306
Bros being dudes.

07:30.307 --> 07:32.866
All the way up there,
that's the next stop.

07:32.867 --> 07:34.066
Oh, goodness me.

07:34.067 --> 07:37.186
Tip of the Needle.
-Let's go.

07:37.187 --> 07:40.707
Whoo!
-If you want adrenaline, this is it.

07:41.867 --> 07:43.866
Oh, my God.

07:43.867 --> 07:45.107
Oh, I see it. I see it, Kurt.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.146
Holy moly.
-OK.

07:48.147 --> 07:49.666
Is that the clue?

07:49.667 --> 07:51.466
Yeah.
-What?!

07:51.467 --> 07:55.826
Oh, my gosh! This is unreal!

07:55.827 --> 07:56.906
Are you kidding?

07:56.907 --> 07:59.187
Korey is zip-lining to the clue?

08:00.467 --> 08:02.146
Is this for real?

08:02.147 --> 08:03.626
Oh, my God.

08:03.627 --> 08:05.226
I think Korey is crazy.

08:05.227 --> 08:07.146
Alright, Kurt,
you're doing the freaky stuff today.

08:07.147 --> 08:09.306
You got this, Kor.
Just don't look down.

08:09.307 --> 08:12.066
Oh, my God. (SCREAMS)

08:12.067 --> 08:13.667
What am I doing?

08:15.107 --> 08:16.506
Are you sure?
-Yes, sure.

08:16.507 --> 08:18.106
Are you sure?
-Yes.

08:18.107 --> 08:21.507
Go! Go, Kurt!
Go, Kurt, go! Go, Kurt!

08:22.507 --> 08:23.546
Holy crap.

08:23.547 --> 08:24.586
Yeah, Kor!

08:24.587 --> 08:26.346
Go, Kurt! Pull!

08:26.347 --> 08:27.786
Oh, my gosh.
-Pull!

08:27.787 --> 08:29.746
Pull, Kor.
(GROANS)

08:29.747 --> 08:31.467
Pull!
-I've got the clue.

08:32.746 --> 08:33.826
I got it! I got it!

08:33.827 --> 08:35.986
Yeah, let's go! Nice, Kurt.

08:35.986 --> 08:37.706
Pull me back.
There we go.

08:37.707 --> 08:41.066
You got this, Korey. Do not drop it.

08:41.067 --> 08:42.826
Good job, Korey.

08:42.827 --> 08:44.386
Holy crap.

08:44.387 --> 08:46.416
Brodie and Kurt
have the lead right now

08:46.417 --> 08:48.866
and will pick between two challenges

08:48.867 --> 08:53.266
that are a crucial part of surviving
in these unforgiving mountains.

08:53.267 --> 08:56.586
<i>In order to avoid
deadly avalanches like this,</i>

08:56.587 --> 09:00.986
<i>ski patrol safety teams use dynamite
to set off controlled explosions...</i>

09:00.987 --> 09:01.987
(EXPLOSION)

09:01.988 --> 09:03.866
<i>..preventing
the accumulation of snow.</i>

09:03.867 --> 09:06.416
Traversing
this mountainside, Via Ferrata,

09:06.417 --> 09:09.746
teams must deliver explosives
and lunch

09:09.747 --> 09:11.466
to these hardworking professionals.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.506
<i>Once the dynamite is detonated,</i>

09:14.507 --> 09:18.026
<i>they can make their way back
to safe ground with their next clue.</i>

09:18.027 --> 09:20.656
To survive in these mountains
overnight,

09:20.657 --> 09:24.786
building shelter
is an essential mountaineering skill

09:24.787 --> 09:27.706
teams will now learn
by setting up camp.

09:27.707 --> 09:30.106
<i>Using this finished example
as a reference,</i>

09:30.107 --> 09:34.226
<i>teams must properly pitch their tent
to earn their next clue.</i>

09:34.227 --> 09:35.626
Let's do that.
-Choose 'Dynamite'.

09:35.627 --> 09:37.066
We're doing 'Dynamite'.
-'Dynamite'.

09:37.067 --> 09:38.626
Let's do 'Dynamite'.
-Let's do 'Dynamite'.

09:38.627 --> 09:43.266
We're going up, y'all.
-Wow. That is crazy. Straight up.

09:43.267 --> 09:45.146
Oh, my gosh. I'm so cold already.

09:45.147 --> 09:46.826
I can't lose any toes.

09:46.827 --> 09:48.386
We need our toes.
-We're dancers.

09:48.387 --> 09:49.537
These toes are not for sale.

09:51.027 --> 09:52.346
OK, station's coming up.

09:52.347 --> 09:54.297
Holy cow.
-Here we go. Whoo!

09:55.297 --> 09:58.106
There it is.
-Ho-ho! Oh, that's cool.

09:58.107 --> 09:59.626
We got this, baby.
-Yeah.

09:59.627 --> 10:02.466
So, what am I doing?
-You're... helping.

10:02.467 --> 10:04.656
What?
-I don't know. Taking this.

10:04.657 --> 10:06.146
Keep me safe.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.186
Apparently,
my life is in Dana's hands.

10:08.187 --> 10:09.266
That's all.

10:09.267 --> 10:11.186
My capable hands.

10:11.187 --> 10:14.826
"Pick up two bundles of dynamite

10:14.827 --> 10:16.706
"from the west side
of the gondola station."

10:16.707 --> 10:19.026
Is this dynamite?

10:19.027 --> 10:20.027
Here we go. Dynamite.

10:20.028 --> 10:21.226
There it is.
-There it is. Wow.

10:21.227 --> 10:22.946
Oh, my gosh. This is insane.

10:22.947 --> 10:26.506
This could be really dangerous,
but I'm willing to risk it.

10:26.507 --> 10:29.026
It's right here.
-Right there. Grab it.

10:29.027 --> 10:30.296
Holy crap.
-Careful.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.656
Let's blow some stuff up.

10:31.657 --> 10:33.536
Oh, my God.

10:33.537 --> 10:36.296
Go ahead, babe. You got it.

10:36.297 --> 10:37.986
Yeah, I got him. No worries.

10:37.987 --> 10:40.226
As long as he doesn't fall. (LAUGHS)

10:40.227 --> 10:44.266
Right now, I see a sheer drop.
Like, 150...

10:44.267 --> 10:45.706
This is so super cool.

10:45.707 --> 10:46.707
Baby, you got this.

10:46.708 --> 10:48.226
This is where we're going
to make up some time.

10:48.227 --> 10:50.506
Yeah, babe. Fast.
Kill it, kill it, kill it!

10:50.507 --> 10:51.706
Work, work, work!

10:51.707 --> 10:53.226
Look at him. He's fast as hell.

10:53.227 --> 10:55.746
Go, baby. You got it.

10:55.747 --> 10:57.986
You got it, baby.

10:57.987 --> 11:01.026
Holy cow. This is insane.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.426
Good job, babe.
Pull me in.

11:03.427 --> 11:05.506
Go ahead, babe. You got it.

11:05.507 --> 11:06.706
You're right there.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.066
I got it.

11:08.067 --> 11:10.387
There you go. You got it.

11:11.787 --> 11:12.787
Oh, my God. She did it.

11:13.947 --> 11:15.146
It's a blizzard!

11:15.147 --> 11:16.587
(SCREAMS)
Careful. Careful.

11:17.587 --> 11:19.026
You got it.

11:19.027 --> 11:20.306
My God.

11:20.307 --> 11:22.386
OK, baby.
Whoa!

11:22.387 --> 11:23.507
No!

11:25.947 --> 11:29.102
Uh-oh. That's not good.

11:35.147 --> 11:36.666
Damn! What a nightmare.

11:36.667 --> 11:39.506
My clue fell off,
so I have to go get another one.

11:39.507 --> 11:42.506
I see it. There it is.
I see it down there.

11:42.507 --> 11:44.026
Let's do 'Dynamite'.

11:44.027 --> 11:46.507
Alright, baby. No big deal.
Let's shake it off. We can get it.

11:48.387 --> 11:50.226
She's going faster than I can pull.

11:50.227 --> 11:51.346
She never quits.

11:51.347 --> 11:53.426
Back on a second time
to get the clue

11:53.427 --> 11:55.746
and I was very, very careful
about where I put it this time.

11:55.747 --> 11:59.386
You got it, sweetie.
-I'm coming. OK, got it this time.

11:59.387 --> 12:00.866
What do you want to do?
-Should we set up a camp?

12:00.867 --> 12:02.466
I think we'll set up a camp.
Do you want to do that?

12:02.467 --> 12:04.826
We went into this leg
trying to get to number one,

12:04.827 --> 12:06.946
so the best way for us to do that
would be to take a risk,

12:06.947 --> 12:08.626
so we did the 'Campsite' challenge

12:08.627 --> 12:11.586
because we knew, at that point,
that no other teams were doing it.

12:11.587 --> 12:12.947
We set up tents all the time.

12:13.947 --> 12:15.506
Heights are not my favourite thing

12:15.507 --> 12:16.866
and we're going higher.

12:16.867 --> 12:20.426
Well, just imagine it's like
you're going to be up there

12:20.427 --> 12:22.266
and jump down to the bottom,

12:22.267 --> 12:24.547
but, really, it's just mind magic.

12:26.067 --> 12:27.547
Yeah, that doesn't help.

12:28.587 --> 12:31.347
This is where we go?
-Oh, wow. That's crazy.

12:32.587 --> 12:34.507
Alright, go, big boy.
-OK.

12:36.107 --> 12:37.227
This is unreal!

12:38.987 --> 12:39.987
Oh, my gosh, dude.

12:42.907 --> 12:45.626
I think it's this way, bro.
Let's go up and around this way.

12:45.627 --> 12:46.746
Holy moly.

12:46.747 --> 12:49.026
So, traversing the mountain
was actually a little difficult.

12:49.027 --> 12:52.546
Kurt led the way and he had a rope
that connected to me

12:52.547 --> 12:55.786
and we really struggled
with that rope the entire time.

12:55.787 --> 12:59.066
Slow down, Kurt. Don't pull me.
Hold on, Kurt. Hold on. Kurt!

12:59.067 --> 13:01.306
No! Dude, don't push me off!

13:01.307 --> 13:03.626
God, dude.
-Alright, alright. Shut up.

13:03.627 --> 13:04.987
Do not drop the dynamite.

13:07.227 --> 13:10.226
We're looking for dynamite.
-This isn't it.

13:10.227 --> 13:12.467
Babe, I'm going to be sick, I think.
I'm going to die.

13:13.867 --> 13:15.587
I'm having a major panic attack.

13:16.707 --> 13:18.146
Let me take it down?

13:18.147 --> 13:19.507
Just get this thing off my neck.

13:21.747 --> 13:24.746
I can't breathe.
There's nothing up here.

13:24.747 --> 13:26.386
Alright,
back to the gondola station.

13:26.387 --> 13:27.946
Are you guys doing 'Dynamite'?

13:27.947 --> 13:29.306
Yeah.
-It's down there, isn't it?

13:29.307 --> 13:30.466
Go get your dynamite.

13:30.467 --> 13:31.626
Go down?
-All the way down.

13:31.627 --> 13:34.426
It said the gondola station.
We knew it wasn't up here.

13:34.427 --> 13:37.107
I don't know why we came up here.
So dumb.

13:38.267 --> 13:39.906
Oh, my God.
-You're fine.

13:39.907 --> 13:40.946
I'm right behind you.

13:40.947 --> 13:42.466
Why I freaking out?
-You're good.

13:42.467 --> 13:43.946
Oh, my God.

13:43.947 --> 13:46.226
I was a mess.
I felt like I was going to die.

13:46.227 --> 13:48.626
It didn't seem like a thing
humans should be doing.

13:48.627 --> 13:51.146
We're strong. Just don't panic.

13:51.147 --> 13:52.147
(WHIMPERS)

13:52.148 --> 13:53.946
Ah. (WHIMPERS)

13:53.947 --> 13:56.946
Oh, my God. Holy crap.

13:56.947 --> 13:58.306
(EXHALES)

13:58.307 --> 13:59.426
You got it, Ty.

13:59.427 --> 14:01.546
Keep going. We're still good.

14:01.547 --> 14:02.946
No-one's doing this quicker than us.

14:02.947 --> 14:04.387
And this is faster than building.

14:07.387 --> 14:10.307
OK, so, we are going to a camp site.
We're going to set up a camp site.

14:13.067 --> 14:14.786
OK, we can do this.

14:14.787 --> 14:19.026
We had to set up
a survival camp site in the Alps,

14:19.027 --> 14:21.226
so we had to stake it down
nice and tight,

14:21.227 --> 14:22.786
build a wall of snow around it.

14:22.787 --> 14:25.626
There had to be
about a metre of snow on every side

14:25.627 --> 14:27.866
to protect the camp site
from the wind.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.866
OK, this looks pretty simple.
-Simple, but it's deceptive.

14:30.867 --> 14:32.787
We got this, babe.
Don't worry about it.

14:33.787 --> 14:34.946
Wow. This is spectacular.

14:34.947 --> 14:38.066
Look at this. It's like
you can see the whole Earth.

14:38.067 --> 14:39.426
We're going to conquer the fear,
babe.

14:39.427 --> 14:40.826
You got it, babe. You got it.
-Whoo!

14:40.827 --> 14:42.706
I love you.
-OK, here...

14:42.707 --> 14:43.786
Whoa!

14:43.787 --> 14:45.986
Why is the clue on a cliff?

14:45.987 --> 14:47.106
That is sketchy, babe.

14:47.107 --> 14:49.587
I'm kind of rethinking
this whole thing.

14:51.587 --> 14:53.106
Oh, my gosh!

14:53.107 --> 14:55.306
Look how high up this is.
-This is so high.

14:55.307 --> 14:57.106
This is unbelievable.

14:57.107 --> 15:00.826
From here,
it looks high and white and rocky

15:00.827 --> 15:02.667
and dangerous and scary
and terrifying.

15:03.667 --> 15:04.906
Are you crying?
-No.

15:04.907 --> 15:06.826
Are you scared?
Are you really that scared?

15:06.827 --> 15:08.467
I don't like this.

15:09.627 --> 15:11.386
There's the peak, dude.

15:11.387 --> 15:13.586
So glad we did this one.

15:13.587 --> 15:15.946
This is unbelievable.

15:15.947 --> 15:16.947
Good job, dude.

15:16.947 --> 15:17.947
We're going fast.
-Yeah.

15:17.948 --> 15:19.466
Careful.

15:19.467 --> 15:21.946
Oh, dude,
I see... I see someone up there.

15:21.947 --> 15:23.106
Yeah!

15:23.107 --> 15:25.186
Are you hungry? Here you go.

15:25.187 --> 15:27.186
Here, grab mine. I'll grab yours.

15:27.187 --> 15:29.706
OK, guys, I have this one for you.
-Yes!

15:29.707 --> 15:33.186
"Take your car
to Planpraz Gondola Station

15:33.187 --> 15:34.866
"and search for your next clue."

15:34.867 --> 15:37.106
Oh, my gosh!

15:37.107 --> 15:39.666
(EXPLOSION)

15:39.667 --> 15:42.867
Whoo! Oh, my gosh!

15:44.267 --> 15:46.386
So awesome!
This is what it's all about.

15:46.387 --> 15:49.147
That was impressive.
-That was impressive.

15:51.307 --> 15:52.747
Wow. This is deep snow.

15:54.027 --> 15:55.186
Whoo!

15:55.187 --> 15:58.066
Man, can you imagine
doing this to survive

15:58.067 --> 16:00.186
when you're fighting for your life?

16:00.187 --> 16:02.227
OK, that looks about
the same distance in.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.026
Yeah, let's get the
tent and we'll see. -OK.

16:06.027 --> 16:07.266
We have two boys at home.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.946
This looks like a pup tent

16:08.947 --> 16:11.387
that we've set up
at least two dozen times.

16:14.587 --> 16:15.587
Here we go.

16:15.588 --> 16:18.066
It broke.
-It broke? What do we do?

16:18.067 --> 16:20.867
OK, um... I don't know.

16:22.547 --> 16:23.786
Holy...

16:23.787 --> 16:25.506
You got it, Ty. We're almost there.

16:25.507 --> 16:26.946
It's just that
my glasses are so foggy.

16:26.947 --> 16:27.947
That's OK.

16:27.948 --> 16:30.706
We're going to climb a little bit.
-Yeah, we're good.

16:30.707 --> 16:32.506
Use your feet more than your arms.

16:32.507 --> 16:34.426
Pull.
-Go.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.786
Yeah.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.426
Yeah, we're killing it.

16:37.427 --> 16:38.986
Good job, Kor.

16:38.987 --> 16:42.106
I've got dynamite for you and bread.

16:42.107 --> 16:43.146
Thank you.

16:43.147 --> 16:45.746
This is so cool.

16:45.747 --> 16:48.866
Holy crap. You've really got
to take it slow and steady.

16:48.867 --> 16:51.906
It is a race, but you can only do
what your body lets you do.

16:51.907 --> 16:54.466
Come on.
-Matt, slow down.

16:54.467 --> 16:55.506
OK.

16:55.507 --> 16:57.226
I do not have 6'1" legs.

16:57.227 --> 16:58.546
Alright. You're OK. You're OK.

16:58.547 --> 17:00.186
Walk.
-Alright.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.546
Oh, my gosh.

17:02.547 --> 17:05.026
Babe, I'm afraid.
-I got you.

17:05.027 --> 17:06.425
Come a little closer.
-Is this what you did?

17:06.426 --> 17:07.906
I'll grab your hand.

17:07.906 --> 17:09.146
I'm afraid.
-You're OK.

17:10.426 --> 17:13.266
Seriously, I'm afraid.
-I got you. You're hooked in.

17:13.267 --> 17:14.267
I got you.

17:14.268 --> 17:16.986
Babe!
-I got you. Just be careful.

17:16.987 --> 17:18.146
Babe, slow down.
-I got you.

17:18.146 --> 17:19.146
Please stay closer to me.

17:19.146 --> 17:20.146
I'm afraid.
-Stand up.

17:20.147 --> 17:21.548
Do you hear me?
-Stand up. You're OK.

17:23.467 --> 17:25.826
OK, babe.
-Oh, my gosh!

17:25.827 --> 17:27.826
I got you. Go fast! Go fast!

17:27.827 --> 17:30.787
You got it, Daddy! Pull!

17:32.337 --> 17:33.337
OK, babe?

17:34.507 --> 17:37.906
OK. (LAUGHS)
-That was freaking crazy.

17:37.907 --> 17:39.666
Good job, Daddy!

17:39.667 --> 17:41.146
Don't drop it!

17:41.147 --> 17:42.706
Let's do 'Dynamite', baby.

17:42.707 --> 17:45.907
I think 'Dynamite'.
-You did so well, Daddy.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.746
(CHUCKLES)

17:48.747 --> 17:50.506
God, we're so high.

17:50.507 --> 17:53.267
(SOBS) Oh, my God.

17:55.027 --> 17:56.857
That's not it, is it?

17:57.907 --> 18:00.026
Oh, my God.

18:00.027 --> 18:01.146
I don't think I can do it.

18:01.147 --> 18:03.576
Mom, are you going to be OK?

18:03.577 --> 18:06.666
Oh, my gosh.
-I'm so scared.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.746
I am so ready for this.

18:08.747 --> 18:10.986
You are going to kill it.
-This is amazing!

18:10.987 --> 18:13.096
(SOBS) Oh, my God.

18:13.097 --> 18:15.336
(SOBS)

18:15.337 --> 18:17.426
Slowly.
-Have you got me?

18:17.427 --> 18:19.706
I was trying
to stay calm and cool...

18:19.707 --> 18:21.066
Oh, my God.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.626
..but it's just really high.

18:22.627 --> 18:24.706
I'm just so, so scared of heights.

18:24.707 --> 18:26.336
You've got it, Jos!

18:26.337 --> 18:28.576
Yeah!

18:28.577 --> 18:30.096
No fear. She's got no fear.

18:30.097 --> 18:32.306
Oh, my God!
You're awesome, Ma!

18:32.307 --> 18:34.506
You got it, Jos!
-I'm good.

18:34.507 --> 18:35.856
Joslyn!

18:35.857 --> 18:38.096
Whoo!
-Whoo!

18:38.097 --> 18:39.706
I'm so scared.

18:39.707 --> 18:41.546
Oh, my God.
-You got this, Mom.

18:41.547 --> 18:45.426
Just don't look down.
-(SOBS) Oh, my God, Cole.

18:45.427 --> 18:48.066
Y'all hold me. Please hold me.

18:48.067 --> 18:51.186
(SOBS)

18:51.187 --> 18:53.088
I'm just so scared.

19:00.537 --> 19:01.625
(SOBS)

19:01.702 --> 19:03.101
You got this, Mom!

19:03.102 --> 19:04.901
Oh, my God!

19:04.902 --> 19:06.781
Y'all hold me. Please hold me.

19:06.782 --> 19:08.291
You're doing awesome, Momma.

19:08.292 --> 19:11.291
You're doing good, Mom.
-You're doing good.

19:11.292 --> 19:13.701
(SOBS)

19:13.702 --> 19:16.051
I'm just so scared.
You're doing good, Mom.

19:16.052 --> 19:18.811
You're almost there.
You're almost there.

19:18.812 --> 19:22.021
It was very scary,
but Cole's already done so much

19:22.022 --> 19:25.291
and I just felt that this was
my time to take care of him...

19:25.292 --> 19:27.141
You're doing good, Momma!

19:27.142 --> 19:28.221
Take me home.

19:28.222 --> 19:31.141
..and I was just going
to be a big girl and just do it,

19:31.142 --> 19:33.981
but I was going to do it
with tears in my eyes.

19:33.982 --> 19:36.021
Yeah, I wouldn't
have been able to do it.

19:36.022 --> 19:37.221
We would have been out.

19:37.222 --> 19:39.462
Mom, I swear, if this is anything
height-related...

19:40.462 --> 19:42.101
Oh, my gosh.

19:42.102 --> 19:43.581
I think we should do 'Dynamite'.

19:43.582 --> 19:45.741
What is...? Is that where
we have to go off the edges?

19:45.742 --> 19:46.781
Mm-hm.

19:46.782 --> 19:49.051
Could you do it, Cole?

19:49.052 --> 19:50.221
I can't do it.

19:50.222 --> 19:52.492
I just think
that's going to be longer.

19:56.942 --> 19:58.501
This is harder than I'm used to.

19:58.502 --> 20:02.021
We've done this a thousand times,
but this one is just so difficult.

20:02.022 --> 20:04.661
Yeah, got it. Got it.
-Yeah?

20:04.662 --> 20:06.531
We've got to widen out
at least a foot.

20:06.532 --> 20:09.422
That's a nightmare. (GROANS)

20:10.422 --> 20:13.421
Don't go too fast. Don't pull me.
-I got you.

20:13.422 --> 20:14.422
This is amazing.

20:14.423 --> 20:16.781
Definitely the coolest thing
we've done so far on the race.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.861
Really cool,
but I can't wait for it to be over.

20:18.862 --> 20:21.531
Alright, let the climb begin.

20:21.532 --> 20:24.341
Holy crap. This is crazy.

20:24.342 --> 20:25.902
Come on. Let's keep trucking.

20:26.902 --> 20:27.902
That was so awesome.

20:27.903 --> 20:30.662
Dynamite and bread for you also.

20:31.782 --> 20:33.261
Whoo!
-Thank you.

20:33.262 --> 20:35.262
Whoo! We got it.

20:37.702 --> 20:39.381
The view is incredible.

20:39.382 --> 20:41.941
I'm not even afraid of heights
anymore up here.

20:41.942 --> 20:44.741
It's just breathtaking. Wow.

20:44.742 --> 20:46.532
This is The Amazing Race.

20:49.702 --> 20:53.291
Dynamite. I see it.
-One, two.

20:53.292 --> 20:54.701
We've got to get lunch, right?

20:54.702 --> 20:56.941
No, it did not say to pick up lunch.

20:56.942 --> 20:58.501
It says we have to deliver lunch.

20:58.502 --> 21:01.531
I think people here
eat baguettes for lunch.

21:01.532 --> 21:02.621
Here's the dynamite.

21:02.622 --> 21:04.811
A team just caught up to us now.

21:04.812 --> 21:06.181
Here's one stick.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.101
Make sure you get lunch too!

21:08.102 --> 21:10.421
What?
-Lunch!

21:10.422 --> 21:11.531
Lunch.

21:11.532 --> 21:13.021
Shall I tell them just kidding?

21:13.022 --> 21:14.941
Is lunch in one of these boxes?

21:14.942 --> 21:16.781
Yeah, we've got to get lunch.
I think it's inside.

21:16.782 --> 21:18.621
Is lunch in here?
-Is this lunch?

21:18.622 --> 21:19.901
Hello?

21:19.902 --> 21:22.021
Lunch?
-I mean, there's lunch in here.

21:22.022 --> 21:24.051
I don't know whose lunch it is.
-Is that lunch?

21:24.052 --> 21:26.941
There's lunch in here,
but it's not marked.

21:26.942 --> 21:28.222
Maybe it's Phil's.

21:29.702 --> 21:30.861
This altitude is something.

21:30.862 --> 21:33.461
You got it. Breathe slow.

21:33.462 --> 21:35.181
(SCREAMS)
Oh!

21:35.182 --> 21:37.531
(SCREAMS) Oh, my gosh.

21:37.532 --> 21:38.582
Get back up.

21:39.742 --> 21:41.022
Oh, my God, Dad.

21:42.292 --> 21:44.701
Now we're headed
to Planpraz Gondola,

21:44.702 --> 21:46.381
so another gondola station.

21:46.382 --> 21:48.501
I'm guessing we're going
to be going back up

21:48.502 --> 21:51.741
for some more funky stuff
in the cold.

21:51.742 --> 21:54.781
We're only doing freaky stuff today.
Whoo!

21:54.782 --> 21:55.811
Oh, there it is. I see the clue.

21:55.812 --> 21:57.301
See it?
-Yeah.

21:57.302 --> 21:59.021
"Who feels the wind
beneath their wings?"

21:59.022 --> 22:00.301
Oh, let's go! I'm doing it!
-Let's go!

22:00.302 --> 22:04.581
Paragliding is not much more
than manoeuvring a soft sail

22:04.582 --> 22:06.221
with a few strings attached -

22:06.222 --> 22:10.541
perhaps the closest you can come
to flying on your own.

22:10.542 --> 22:12.941
<i>Launching from more than 7,000 feet,</i>

22:12.942 --> 22:16.061
<i>teams will tandem paraglide
with an experienced pilot.</i>

22:16.062 --> 22:17.381
<i>When they land,</i>

22:17.382 --> 22:20.101
<i>they must correctly answer
the mountain watchman's question</i>

22:20.102 --> 22:22.902
<i>about what they've seen
to receive their next clue.</i>

22:24.502 --> 22:26.061
"Look for the yeti."

22:26.062 --> 22:27.181
BOTH: "When you land,

22:27.182 --> 22:29.901
"answer the mountain watchman's
question about the yeti correctly

22:29.902 --> 22:31.181
"to receive your next clue."

22:31.182 --> 22:34.501
Who's Jose? Who's Jose? You're Jose.
Let's go. Let's go.

22:34.502 --> 22:36.341
Oh, my gosh, dude.

22:36.342 --> 22:38.221
Let's go!
(SCREAMS)

22:38.222 --> 22:39.821
Buddy!

22:39.822 --> 22:41.181
Whoo!

22:41.182 --> 22:43.102
Let's go, Brodie! Let's go!
-Let's go!

22:44.102 --> 22:45.942
(SNIGGERS) This is so sick.

22:49.302 --> 22:51.661
I just... I'm afraid,
if we're setting up a camp site,

22:51.662 --> 22:53.861
it'll take us forever
to set up a tent.

22:53.862 --> 22:55.581
(EXHALES)

22:55.582 --> 22:58.221
Maybe it's up here?

22:58.222 --> 22:59.621
Have you guys seen lunch?

22:59.622 --> 23:00.901
No.
-No?

23:00.902 --> 23:03.261
We haven't made up our mind yet.

23:03.262 --> 23:05.102
It's got to be up here, then.

23:08.102 --> 23:10.222
Let's do it.
-We're going to do 'Dynamite'.

23:12.302 --> 23:14.101
There's nobody coming down
that mountain.

23:14.102 --> 23:15.301
Really?

23:15.302 --> 23:19.221
We seem to be the only team
doing this challenge so far.

23:19.222 --> 23:20.862
This could be a good thing
or a bad thing.

23:23.942 --> 23:27.381
Where's lunch?
-I feel light-headed.

23:27.382 --> 23:28.661
Maybe it's up here.

23:28.662 --> 23:31.181
Is there lunch up here?

23:31.182 --> 23:33.301
We have a baguette.
Does that count as lunch?

23:33.302 --> 23:35.221
Who eats a baguette only for lunch?

23:35.222 --> 23:37.862
OK, that was a trick.
-(GROANS)

23:38.902 --> 23:40.541
Do you want to fly?
It's going to be high.

23:40.542 --> 23:41.581
My glasses are going to fog.

23:41.582 --> 23:42.661
I want you to do it.
-OK, I'll do it.

23:42.662 --> 23:44.621
We're going to paraglide.

23:44.622 --> 23:45.781
Yeah!

23:45.782 --> 23:48.741
Korey! (LAUGHS)

23:48.742 --> 23:50.061
Oh, my God.

23:50.062 --> 23:53.302
I'm so nervous for him. (LAUGHS)

23:54.542 --> 23:55.701
OK, slow and steady.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.941
Don't be scared 'cause this is,
like, going to be freaking awesome.

23:57.942 --> 23:58.942
Oh.

24:00.382 --> 24:01.582
Hold on!

24:03.262 --> 24:05.741
This is freaking crazy.

24:05.742 --> 24:08.142
Definitely don't want to slide off
the side of this thing.

24:10.222 --> 24:12.062
So, we scale across this?

24:14.662 --> 24:16.461
Cole, it's easy. We got this.
-Are we going to be safe?

24:16.462 --> 24:17.462
Yes.
-We're not even...

24:20.102 --> 24:22.502
Cole, I'll be crying too,
but we'll be OK.

24:24.613 --> 24:26.436
Wow. This is unbelievable.

24:26.677 --> 24:27.876
Holy smokes.

24:27.877 --> 24:31.277
Oh, my gosh. We're just going
to run right off this thing?

24:32.877 --> 24:35.316
See, now, winning
a million dollars is great,

24:35.317 --> 24:37.196
but this is what The Amazing Race
is all about -

24:37.197 --> 24:40.236
doing stuff you'd never do
in your entire life.

24:40.237 --> 24:41.916
Oh, my goodness.

24:41.917 --> 24:43.276
Brodie!

24:43.277 --> 24:45.836
Dude! This is so sick!

24:45.837 --> 24:47.636
This is insane.

24:47.637 --> 24:50.356
I'm literally about to run
off a mountain, bro.

24:50.357 --> 24:52.836
Make sure and look
for that yeti, though, huh?

24:52.837 --> 24:53.837
I got it.

24:53.838 --> 24:55.556
I once dated a yeti.

24:55.557 --> 24:57.876
Well... that's interesting.

24:57.877 --> 25:00.156
Oh, my gosh.

25:00.157 --> 25:01.636
Brodie is about to take off.

25:01.637 --> 25:05.276
Oh, my gosh! This is deep.
Look how deep that is.

25:05.277 --> 25:07.756
I don't know how fast
I can run in this snow.

25:07.757 --> 25:08.957
Oh, my goodness.

25:10.957 --> 25:13.037
One, two... OK.

25:14.117 --> 25:16.636
Oh, my gosh. Yes!

25:16.637 --> 25:19.516
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25:19.517 --> 25:20.836
Oh, my...!

25:20.837 --> 25:22.877
Oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh.

25:24.117 --> 25:25.237
Are we doing it?

25:31.357 --> 25:33.396
Well, that didn't work.

25:33.397 --> 25:35.316
Oh, man this is what we need.

25:35.317 --> 25:36.676
Dang it.

25:36.677 --> 25:38.716
Are they going to go in front of us?

25:38.717 --> 25:39.796
Eugh.

25:39.797 --> 25:41.076
We won't be first then.

25:41.077 --> 25:42.916
Tyler and I were ready
for our first,

25:42.917 --> 25:46.317
and maybe that mistake right there
could be our first place.

25:47.717 --> 25:49.317
I didn't plan for this.

25:51.277 --> 25:52.756
Taking off is kind of important

25:52.757 --> 25:55.516
'cause if you don't take off right,
you get passed.

25:55.517 --> 25:58.156
One, two, three. Pull.

25:58.157 --> 26:01.436
Go fast. Go fast. Go fast.

26:01.437 --> 26:03.076
Pull. Pull.

26:03.077 --> 26:04.876
Pull up. Now pull up.

26:04.877 --> 26:06.396
Pull up. Pull up.

26:06.397 --> 26:07.477
Did we make it?

26:09.117 --> 26:11.317
We did it? Oh, my God!

26:13.197 --> 26:14.956
Well, there goes first place.

26:14.957 --> 26:18.116
So frustrating, man. So frustrating.

26:18.117 --> 26:23.476
Oh, my God. This is incredible.

26:23.477 --> 26:25.076
Is that a yeti?

26:25.077 --> 26:26.396
Yes, it is.

26:26.397 --> 26:28.396
That's a yeti with the French flag.

26:28.397 --> 26:29.877
(GRUNTS)

26:30.997 --> 26:34.916
Me and my teammate have got
a lot of second places.

26:34.917 --> 26:36.277
It's our turn for a first.

26:39.877 --> 26:42.396
This is the one. I feel it.
Here we go.

26:42.397 --> 26:44.476
Run, run, run.
-Whoo!

26:44.477 --> 26:47.876
Whoo!
-Run, run, run, run.

26:47.877 --> 26:49.956
Oh, yeah.

26:49.957 --> 26:51.916
Yeah!
-Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

26:51.917 --> 26:54.076
Holy cow.

26:54.077 --> 26:56.516
Yeah!

26:56.517 --> 26:57.916
This is so sick!

26:57.917 --> 26:59.236
Oh, there's the yeti.

26:59.237 --> 27:00.716
Yeah. I see the yeti
with the French flag.

27:00.717 --> 27:02.916
(GRUNTS)

27:02.917 --> 27:04.876
Hey, yeti!

27:04.877 --> 27:07.676
Yeti! Whoo!

27:07.677 --> 27:09.757
Oh, my gosh. Look at this.

27:12.237 --> 27:15.076
Wow.

27:15.077 --> 27:19.317
Holy cow, guys.
This is unbelievable.

27:20.877 --> 27:23.476
We're flying!

27:23.477 --> 27:24.876
Oh!

27:24.877 --> 27:26.717
Oh, my gosh!

27:27.997 --> 27:29.916
I think we're getting close,
sweetie.

27:29.917 --> 27:31.596
This is looking really livable.

27:31.597 --> 27:32.956
We could move in here.

27:32.957 --> 27:34.477
Alright, judge. Judge.

27:39.357 --> 27:41.596
OK.

27:41.597 --> 27:42.636
OK.
-OK.

27:42.637 --> 27:45.716
We don't have enough snow
to provide protection from the wind,

27:45.717 --> 27:47.796
so we're going to have to sit
here and pile up some snow

27:47.797 --> 27:48.797
for a little while.

27:50.477 --> 27:52.277
Yeah. Oh, man.

27:53.597 --> 27:57.636
Oh, wow. This is freaking awesome.

27:57.637 --> 28:00.916
Erin, there's finally
a handsome man to greet us.

28:00.917 --> 28:02.036
Whoo!

28:02.037 --> 28:04.836
He's cute.
-Do you want to date Joslyn?

28:04.837 --> 28:06.237
No, I'm married.
-You're married.

28:06.238 --> 28:07.716
Oh, your lucky wife.

28:07.717 --> 28:10.077
OK, we'll stop flirting with you.

28:11.237 --> 28:12.956
This is one of Cole's biggest fears.

28:12.957 --> 28:14.396
Oh.

28:14.397 --> 28:15.836
Oh, God.

28:15.837 --> 28:17.196
I might cry.

28:17.197 --> 28:18.756
You're doing a good job.

28:18.757 --> 28:20.116
I'm just afraid.

28:20.117 --> 28:21.196
It's OK.

28:21.197 --> 28:23.356
And this is us getting out.

28:23.357 --> 28:26.716
This is like a big, huge,
cool adventure.

28:26.717 --> 28:27.877
Look at where we are.

28:29.117 --> 28:31.316
No. No, I don't want to look.

28:31.317 --> 28:32.557
OK.

28:38.237 --> 28:41.276
Is that Brodie? Let's go, Brodie!

28:41.277 --> 28:44.476
Oh, man, Tyler is going
to be so excited.

28:44.477 --> 28:46.596
I cannot believe we passed the boys.

28:46.597 --> 28:48.156
Oh, my gosh! They're going down!

28:48.157 --> 28:50.037
Look what he's doing!

28:52.317 --> 28:54.596
Oh, my God!

28:54.597 --> 28:55.676
Brodie?

28:55.677 --> 28:57.396
I hope that's Brodie.

28:57.397 --> 29:00.797
Ah! This is incredible.

29:01.797 --> 29:03.716
Brodie?

29:03.717 --> 29:05.916
Is that...? Who is that?

29:05.917 --> 29:07.116
Tyler?

29:07.117 --> 29:08.476
Is that Korey?

29:08.477 --> 29:10.556
We're number one!

29:10.557 --> 29:11.796
Tyler!

29:11.797 --> 29:13.916
Oh, my God. Korey!

29:13.917 --> 29:16.357
How did Korey pass Brodie?
-How did that happen?

29:18.317 --> 29:20.036
A French flag.
-French flag?

29:20.037 --> 29:22.396
Yeah!
-Yeah! Congratulations.

29:22.397 --> 29:23.956
Tyler, let's open it!
-You got it?

29:23.957 --> 29:25.916
Yeah!
-Oh, my God, Korey!

29:25.917 --> 29:27.756
Open it, open it, open it!

29:27.757 --> 29:31.756
PHIL: <i>The summit of Mont Blanc
was first conquered in 1786</i>

29:31.757 --> 29:35.036
by this man,
Michel-Gabriel Paccard -

29:35.037 --> 29:37.516
<i>a 29-year-old doctor from Chamonix.</i>

29:37.517 --> 29:41.596
The last team to find me here
under the watchful eye of Michel

29:41.597 --> 29:43.796
may be eliminated.

29:43.797 --> 29:45.596
Let's go, Brodie!

29:45.597 --> 29:46.916
Oh!

29:46.917 --> 29:48.556
Wow!

29:48.557 --> 29:51.836
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

29:51.837 --> 29:54.076
Oh! 10-point landing.

29:54.077 --> 29:55.436
How did Korey pass you?

29:55.437 --> 29:58.076
I'll tell you in a little bit, man.
I'm sorry.

29:58.077 --> 29:59.796
This thing is, like, a nightmare.

29:59.797 --> 30:01.756
Guess we should have dug
down further, huh?

30:01.757 --> 30:04.836
Yeah, would have been easier
to dig down than to pile up.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.076
OK, I think we got it.
I think we got it.

30:06.077 --> 30:07.597
OK.

30:11.997 --> 30:13.956
OK.
Oh, thank you very much!

30:13.957 --> 30:15.316
Thank you.
-We're all done.

30:15.317 --> 30:16.756
Oh, thank God.

30:16.757 --> 30:18.356
We got to go back up the stairs.

30:18.357 --> 30:21.820
I'm winded.
My legs are just dead.

30:25.476 --> 30:27.671
OK. You OK, Momma?
-Yeah.

30:27.867 --> 30:28.867
Almost there.

30:28.868 --> 30:30.666
Cole, you're doing
such a good job.

30:30.667 --> 30:31.906
Alright. Dynamite.

30:31.907 --> 30:33.186
This one is for you.

30:33.187 --> 30:34.187
Thank you.

30:35.108 --> 30:36.268
It was good that we did this.

30:37.828 --> 30:39.107
I'm afraid we're last.

30:39.108 --> 30:40.227
I think so too.

30:40.228 --> 30:43.387
Maybe we can make up some time
in something else. Who knows?

30:43.388 --> 30:46.107
Whoo! That was a hike.

30:46.108 --> 30:50.987
ASHLEY: We underestimated
the shovelling part of the Detour.

30:50.988 --> 30:52.827
We got to wait for another gondola.
-Yeah.

30:52.828 --> 30:53.868
Sheri and Cole were there.

30:55.588 --> 30:56.707
We're last.

30:56.708 --> 30:59.027
We're last.
-Oh.

30:59.028 --> 31:01.827
We took a risk and
it didn't pay off.

31:01.828 --> 31:04.468
Y'all want to work together
and get in front of people?

31:10.108 --> 31:11.108
Damn.

31:16.948 --> 31:18.827
(LAUGHTER)

31:18.828 --> 31:20.387
Welcome to the French Alps.

31:20.388 --> 31:21.747
Yay!
-Thank you.

31:21.748 --> 31:24.507
Tyler and Korey,
today you are team number one.

31:24.508 --> 31:27.147
Yes!

31:27.148 --> 31:28.507
As the winners
of this leg of the race,

31:28.508 --> 31:30.987
you have won a trip for two
from Travelocity

31:30.988 --> 31:34.787
and you are going to Boracay Island
in the Philippines.

31:34.788 --> 31:36.707
(LAUGHS)

31:36.708 --> 31:39.827
<i>You're going to stay five nights
at the Tree House Villa</i>

31:39.828 --> 31:43.307
<i>at the Shangri-La
Boracay Resort & Spa.</i>

31:43.308 --> 31:47.427
<i>You're going to enjoy a private
barbecue dinner on the beach</i>

31:47.428 --> 31:52.307
<i>and relax with an ancient
Philippine massage at the Chi spa.</i>

31:52.308 --> 31:54.907
We're feeling it.
We've been second a couple of times.

31:54.908 --> 31:57.187
We've been chasing those boys
all over the world

31:57.188 --> 32:00.067
and we were ready to have
one mistake on their part

32:00.068 --> 32:01.107
to get back in front of them.

32:01.108 --> 32:02.787
Here they are!

32:02.788 --> 32:04.227
Get it, boys!

32:04.228 --> 32:05.947
Didn't mean to leave you
on the mountain.

32:05.948 --> 32:08.147
We would have done the same thing.

32:08.148 --> 32:11.947
Korey and Tyler were behind us
all day. They deserve it. It's fine.

32:11.948 --> 32:13.947
KOREY: Tyler and I can do anything,

32:13.948 --> 32:16.267
and I think five legs in
we've proved that.

32:16.268 --> 32:17.907
I'm not as intimidated
by them anymore,

32:17.908 --> 32:20.307
because when it comes down to it,
we can power through.

32:20.308 --> 32:23.028
Continued domination
is in our future.

32:26.628 --> 32:27.747
Wow.

32:27.748 --> 32:30.147
Before I was a professional dancer,
I was a competitive snowboarder.

32:30.148 --> 32:31.867
I lived on the mountains
for 10 years,

32:31.868 --> 32:33.227
and since I moved to LA

32:33.228 --> 32:34.987
I haven't been able to go back
to the mountains,

32:34.988 --> 32:37.547
so this is, like, unbelievable.

32:37.548 --> 32:39.747
Let's go.
-Go.

32:39.748 --> 32:41.507
Oh, my God.

32:41.508 --> 32:45.387
Faster. Run, run, run, run.

32:45.388 --> 32:46.627
Yeah.

32:46.628 --> 32:47.668
Oh, my gosh. We did it.

32:48.908 --> 32:51.307
Perfect take-off, man.
-Yeah.

32:51.308 --> 32:52.667
Look at this view!

32:52.668 --> 32:53.827
This is amazing.

32:53.828 --> 32:55.147
Wow.

32:55.148 --> 32:57.147
A brown yeti monster...

32:57.148 --> 32:58.347
(GRUNTS)

32:58.348 --> 33:00.147
..is waving a French flag.

33:00.148 --> 33:04.387
This is why we came on
The Amazing Race,

33:04.388 --> 33:05.388
for a day like today.

33:05.389 --> 33:08.107
Look at this. Wow.

33:08.108 --> 33:10.067
I would have hated
to have had to go home

33:10.068 --> 33:12.187
before this leg right here.

33:12.188 --> 33:14.147
Guys, this is crazy.

33:14.148 --> 33:15.348
Let's go.
-Let's do it.

33:17.908 --> 33:20.347
Run, run.
-Oh, my goodness.

33:20.348 --> 33:21.988
Oh!

33:23.108 --> 33:24.867
Oh!

33:24.868 --> 33:26.627
Oh, my God.

33:26.628 --> 33:29.228
So, now do we have a chance
to get in front of them?

33:30.748 --> 33:33.907
BOTH: "Who feels the wind
beneath their wings?"

33:33.908 --> 33:34.947
Are you ready?
-I'm ready.

33:34.948 --> 33:37.067
Are you ready to do it?
-I'll do it. -OK.

33:37.068 --> 33:38.707
I'm going to hunt a yeti.

33:38.708 --> 33:40.628
I'm a yeti hunter, really.

33:41.868 --> 33:44.788
Oh, my God! Whoo!

33:46.508 --> 33:48.627
Oh, my God.

33:48.628 --> 33:50.067
Wow.

33:50.068 --> 33:52.187
I think it's Matt. I hope it's Matt.

33:52.188 --> 33:53.307
He was up there third.

33:53.308 --> 33:55.907
Whoo!

33:55.908 --> 33:59.587
Alright, come down! Stop having fun.
We've got stuff to do.

33:59.588 --> 34:01.067
OK, I'm doing it.
-OK.

34:01.068 --> 34:02.547
Alright, you do, it.
-I'm doing it.

34:02.548 --> 34:04.147
This is good that
I'm doing this for you.

34:04.148 --> 34:05.307
OK.
-You'd be scared.

34:05.308 --> 34:07.307
This is definitely
my favourite leg of the race.

34:07.308 --> 34:08.387
I grew up in the mountains,

34:08.388 --> 34:09.587
I grew up snowboarding.

34:09.588 --> 34:11.706
It was really an amazing thing
to come back to today.

34:11.708 --> 34:13.507
It was a great place for him
to do a challenge like this.

34:13.507 --> 34:16.068
This is something I'll remember
for the rest of my life for sure.

34:17.027 --> 34:18.536
Oh, my gosh.

34:18.538 --> 34:20.746
Oh, man. Look at that. Oh!
-Oh!

34:20.748 --> 34:22.306
Oh!

34:22.308 --> 34:23.467
Is that Rachel?

34:23.467 --> 34:24.507
Rachel?

34:25.748 --> 34:27.577
Blair?
-I think that's Rachel.

34:27.578 --> 34:29.827
Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my gosh!

34:29.828 --> 34:32.427
I have a feeling it's not Blair
'cause I think we could hear her.

34:32.428 --> 34:34.027
Daddy!

34:34.027 --> 34:35.947
Hey, Blair!

34:35.947 --> 34:37.627
Good job! Good job!

34:37.628 --> 34:40.266
Whoo! There's my daddy!

34:40.268 --> 34:43.306
Oh, my gosh. What the heck?
Where's Rachel?

34:43.308 --> 34:44.947
Daddy, I did it!

34:44.947 --> 34:46.867
Good job, Blair.
-Thank you.

34:46.868 --> 34:48.746
There's hopefully Rachel.

34:48.748 --> 34:50.507
Hopefully it's my wife.

34:50.507 --> 34:53.097
It's Rachel. Perfect landing, babe.

34:53.098 --> 34:55.266
So, you got to have
a little bit of courage

34:55.268 --> 34:56.536
and some speed to...

34:56.538 --> 34:58.828
Jump off that mountain.
-..get your position. Yeah.

35:01.788 --> 35:03.987
I feel incredible right now.

35:03.988 --> 35:08.867
This is the most magical thing
I've ever seen.

35:08.868 --> 35:10.267
We've got to get moving
pretty quickly.

35:10.268 --> 35:11.668
We've got two teams behind us.

35:12.828 --> 35:15.187
Oh, no. We've got a team coming in.

35:15.188 --> 35:17.267
I think it's the yellow team.

35:17.268 --> 35:19.507
That means there's another team
behind her and that's it.

35:19.508 --> 35:20.508
It's just us.

35:22.948 --> 35:24.057
This is it.

35:24.058 --> 35:27.947
So, I'm going to run like the wind
down this mountain.

35:27.948 --> 35:29.187
This is so cool, though.

35:29.188 --> 35:31.187
I can't believe we get to do this.
-Yeah.

35:31.188 --> 35:34.387
Are you a competitor?
-Yeah, I'm a competitor, buddy.

35:34.388 --> 35:35.667
We got to win.

35:35.668 --> 35:38.427
We got to get this take-off.
The take-off is the most important.

35:38.428 --> 35:40.228
Don't fall down.
-Don't fall down.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.987
This is it.
This is the last three teams here.

35:48.988 --> 35:50.097
We wait for the best wind.

35:50.098 --> 35:51.508
I think we're waiting for wind.

35:53.028 --> 35:54.667
Don't fall down.
Do not fall down.

35:54.668 --> 35:55.707
Don't fall down.

35:55.708 --> 35:58.098
Let's go, quick. Let's go.

36:01.388 --> 36:02.787
Come on.

36:02.788 --> 36:05.387
No! Oh!

36:05.388 --> 36:07.387
Oh!

36:07.388 --> 36:08.578
Oh, my God.

36:17.675 --> 36:21.074
Come on. Come on. Come on.

36:21.075 --> 36:22.475
Oh, man.

36:23.069 --> 36:24.868
ASHLEY: I felt terrible
climbing back up.

36:25.264 --> 36:27.463
I was worried that
I would get us eliminated

36:27.464 --> 36:29.903
and it was all of us girls
there ready to go

36:29.904 --> 36:31.813
and the last one
off that mountain

36:31.814 --> 36:33.743
was going to be the one
to get eliminated.

36:33.744 --> 36:35.423
But we were at the mercy
of the wind.

36:35.424 --> 36:36.903
If it was coming in one way,

36:36.904 --> 36:38.264
we just couldn't take off.

36:40.624 --> 36:42.143
I'm really nervous right now.

36:42.144 --> 36:43.424
Only one shot.
-Yep.

36:45.024 --> 36:46.024
OK.

36:46.025 --> 36:47.583
Oh, gosh.
I'm so afraid I'm going to fall.

36:47.584 --> 36:48.903
Keep standing.
-Keep standing.

36:48.904 --> 36:51.263
One, two, three. Let's go.

36:51.264 --> 36:53.543
Oh, my God.
-Run, run, run.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.773
Run, run, run.
-Argh!

36:55.774 --> 36:59.103
Run, run, run.
-This is crazy!

36:59.104 --> 37:03.063
Run! Run! Whoo-hoo!
-Whoo-hoo!

37:03.064 --> 37:06.544
I did it. Oh, my God. Oh, wow.

37:08.104 --> 37:10.263
Wow.

37:10.264 --> 37:11.503
I can't believe I'm doing this.

37:11.504 --> 37:14.293
Oh, we did it. Wow.

37:14.294 --> 37:15.943
(LAUGHS)

37:15.944 --> 37:18.184
Oh, my gosh. Whoo!

37:20.064 --> 37:21.903
I got to win.
-Let's go.

37:21.904 --> 37:24.183
Whoa. Keep running.

37:24.184 --> 37:25.943
Oh!

37:25.944 --> 37:27.584
Oh, no. No.

37:28.904 --> 37:30.333
No, no, no.

37:30.334 --> 37:33.813
Let's go. Come on, come on, come on.

37:33.814 --> 37:34.984
Oh, man.

37:37.624 --> 37:40.024
Oh, my God.
-Thank God she couldn't take off.

37:41.944 --> 37:43.144
Thank you, Jesus.

37:44.464 --> 37:46.223
Favourite team on the race?

37:46.224 --> 37:48.183
Well...

37:48.184 --> 37:50.463
..I mean, I have a favourite....
-You're not going to say.

37:50.464 --> 37:52.183
Do you have a favourite team
on the race?

37:52.184 --> 37:53.263
I love all of you equally.

37:53.264 --> 37:56.063
Well, I love all of you equally.

37:56.064 --> 37:58.463
Rachel, you've flown
right into fifth place.

37:58.464 --> 38:00.104
(BOTH CHEER)
-Pretty good!

38:06.424 --> 38:08.383
Whoo-hoo!

38:08.384 --> 38:10.183
Oh, my God!

38:10.184 --> 38:11.294
Whoo!

38:12.904 --> 38:16.623
Oh! Look at that. That's just crazy.
-Oh, my gosh.

38:16.624 --> 38:17.903
They're doing those things
right now?

38:17.904 --> 38:19.903
They got...
-Oh, my gosh.

38:19.904 --> 38:22.063
Whoo-hoo!

38:22.064 --> 38:25.463
So, that could potentially be
Ashley or Erin in the air, right?

38:25.464 --> 38:27.023
Or Sheri.
-Or Sheri, sorry.

38:27.024 --> 38:29.183
We don't know.

38:29.184 --> 38:31.183
My son doesn't even know this is me.

38:31.184 --> 38:33.424
Honestly, Cole,
that looks like a red jacket.

38:34.944 --> 38:36.333
If that's my mom
I'm going to cry.

38:36.334 --> 38:37.623
Mom?

38:37.624 --> 38:39.143
Cole!

38:39.144 --> 38:41.293
Yeah! Yeah! Come on!

38:41.294 --> 38:44.813
We did it! I did it! (LAUGHS)

38:44.814 --> 38:46.543
Oh, my God.

38:46.544 --> 38:48.773
Yeah, Momma!
Whoo!

38:48.774 --> 38:49.944
Oh, there's another one.

38:52.624 --> 38:54.064
Erin?

38:55.104 --> 38:57.224
Who is that? Ashley?

38:58.704 --> 39:01.383
Who is it? Who is it?
-I have no idea.

39:01.384 --> 39:03.813
Oh, my gosh, this is insane.

39:03.814 --> 39:05.624
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

39:07.104 --> 39:08.943
Who are you?
-Erin?

39:08.944 --> 39:10.333
Who is that?

39:10.334 --> 39:12.023
Who's up there?

39:12.024 --> 39:13.983
Ashley?

39:13.984 --> 39:15.183
Hi, sweetie!

39:15.184 --> 39:16.583
Oh, my God! It's Ashley.

39:16.584 --> 39:18.023
Yes!

39:18.024 --> 39:19.543
That was so cool.

39:19.544 --> 39:22.063
I love you so much, baby.
I am so proud of you.

39:22.064 --> 39:24.263
So cool.
-Come on. Jump in the car.

39:24.264 --> 39:25.703
We're racing, we're racing.

39:25.704 --> 39:27.813
We're the only people left here.

39:27.814 --> 39:31.063
I'm curious to find out
what happened because not sure.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.903
Not sure what's happening up there.

39:33.904 --> 39:36.383
Alright, I got it. I got it.

39:36.384 --> 39:38.024
Go. Go.

39:39.814 --> 39:42.144
(WHIMPERS)

39:44.664 --> 39:45.944
Argh!

39:47.384 --> 39:48.624
We almost did it.

39:50.264 --> 39:52.743
Almost had it.

39:52.744 --> 39:54.773
Baby, wow. That was incredible.

39:54.774 --> 39:57.143
So what happened with Erin that
she wasn't able to go down?

39:57.144 --> 39:58.423
She fell.

39:58.424 --> 40:01.263
I felt awful for her because
I had just been there. -Wow.

40:01.264 --> 40:03.183
At the same time, it was
a little bit of a relief

40:03.184 --> 40:05.703
that I could do this after all,
and I did.

40:05.704 --> 40:06.743
Whoo!

40:06.744 --> 40:09.023
The other team took off.
We're officially in last place.

40:09.024 --> 40:11.703
I'm kind of worried.
Really worried at this point.

40:11.704 --> 40:13.744
I don't even see her in the sky.

40:15.184 --> 40:16.983
We have to get it.

40:16.984 --> 40:19.333
Yeah, I'm good.
-Go.

40:19.334 --> 40:22.773
(SCREAMS)

40:22.774 --> 40:24.463
Whoo-hoo!

40:24.464 --> 40:26.423
This is so beautiful.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.293
(CRYING) Oh, my gosh.

40:28.294 --> 40:31.333
This is the most incredible thing
I've ever seen.

40:31.334 --> 40:33.184
It is so beautiful.

40:35.624 --> 40:38.063
Burnie and Ashley,
I am pleased to tell you

40:38.064 --> 40:40.103
that you are team number six!

40:40.104 --> 40:42.333
Yay!

40:42.334 --> 40:44.503
Sheri and Cole,
you're team number seven.

40:44.504 --> 40:45.983
Yay!
I'll take it!

40:45.984 --> 40:47.663
Cole, are you proud
of your mom today?

40:47.664 --> 40:49.103
Absolutely, so proud.

40:49.104 --> 40:50.663
It was her fear
just as much as mine,

40:50.664 --> 40:53.813
so she really womaned up to it
more than I ever could have,

40:53.814 --> 40:55.503
so this is all her.

40:55.504 --> 40:56.544
All my momma.

40:58.624 --> 41:01.263
Look at this.

41:01.264 --> 41:04.813
Oh, my gosh. This is so beautiful.

41:04.814 --> 41:07.503
I'm so blessed
to be able to be here.

41:07.504 --> 41:10.333
I wish Joslyn could see this.

41:10.334 --> 41:11.903
Erin, is that you?

41:11.904 --> 41:13.503
Joslyn!

41:13.504 --> 41:14.903
Erin!

41:14.904 --> 41:16.703
Joslyn, I'm sorry it took so long.

41:16.704 --> 41:18.543
It's OK. Don't worry about it.

41:18.544 --> 41:20.183
I'm glad that you got down.

41:20.184 --> 41:21.333
OK, let's go.

41:21.334 --> 41:22.463
We're last.

41:22.464 --> 41:24.294
You never know, Erin.
We might keep racing.

41:27.904 --> 41:29.333
Here we go.
-Phil!

41:29.334 --> 41:31.223
Oh, my gosh.

41:31.224 --> 41:33.263
Erin and Joslyn,
I'm really sorry to tell you

41:33.264 --> 41:37.223
that you are the last team
to arrive and unfortunately,

41:37.224 --> 41:39.544
you have been eliminated
from the race.

41:42.334 --> 41:44.023
It was unreal and breathtaking

41:44.024 --> 41:46.423
and I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
-Yeah.

41:46.424 --> 41:48.983
Erin, do you have a particular
moment where you just went,

41:48.984 --> 41:50.333
"Wow, this is The Amazing Race"?

41:50.334 --> 41:54.423
Yeah, definitely when I was
paragliding over the French Alps,

41:54.424 --> 41:59.293
there was a moment in there
where I was just so grateful

41:59.294 --> 42:02.983
for the opportunity to be here
and to be able to do this.

42:02.984 --> 42:04.813
We're both so blessed.

42:04.814 --> 42:07.383
Blessed to be able to work together,

42:07.384 --> 42:09.943
blessed to be able to do
what we do for our jobs

42:09.944 --> 42:12.263
and really blessed
to be on this race.

42:12.264 --> 42:14.624
You killed it, girl.
-We do. We do.
