WEBVTT

00:02.469 --> 00:03.348
Barney check it:

00:04.311 --> 00:07.365
Three blonde babies drinking
bad decision juice at 8:00.

00:08.818 --> 00:10.123
Nice rack radar.

00:10.752 --> 00:13.391
- That's my wife.
- No, I got to get going.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.050
Seriously?
But they're blonde and drunk.

00:16.175 --> 00:17.365
Isn't that your type?

00:17.817 --> 00:20.420
Maybe I don't have a type, Lily.

00:20.881 --> 00:23.615
God, do you think
the male mind is really

00:23.740 --> 00:25.172
that simplistic,

00:25.297 --> 00:27.727
that we all have one favorite type?

00:27.853 --> 00:28.831
Geez.

00:29.071 --> 00:30.296
Asian with some boob.

00:30.889 --> 00:33.309
I'm gonna hit the bathroom,
then bail.

00:33.903 --> 00:36.782
Okay, have you guys noticed
Barney's been acting weird lately?

00:37.035 --> 00:38.096
Actually, yes.

00:38.222 --> 00:40.276
You know how he always says
never buy a girl flowers,

00:40.401 --> 00:42.430
'cause giving her a living thing
reminds her babies?

00:42.598 --> 00:44.797
- Sure.
- Well, the other day,

00:45.087 --> 00:48.247
I saw him at that flower shop
on 82nd buying roses.

00:48.415 --> 00:50.054
- What?
- Now that you mention it,

00:50.179 --> 00:52.933
Barney did do something kind of odd
at the office yesterday.

00:53.430 --> 00:55.022
Okay, see you Saturday.

00:55.148 --> 00:57.536
I'm thinking brunch,
farmer's market, maybe a hike.

00:58.301 --> 00:59.615
I love you, too.

00:59.741 --> 01:00.549
Bye.

01:02.314 --> 01:05.492
I figured he was just talking
to some girl he was trying to nail.

01:05.618 --> 01:07.575
Or Ted, but now I don't know.

01:08.165 --> 01:11.326
Wait, do you think it's possible
that Barney Stinson

01:11.849 --> 01:13.203
has a girlfriend?

01:14.132 --> 01:15.037
Later.

01:15.163 --> 01:17.287
Wait, Barney, hold on.
Where are you going?

01:17.455 --> 01:18.458
Nowhere.

01:19.015 --> 01:21.302
The beach.
It's winter. Lazer Tag.

01:21.427 --> 01:23.146
Home. Shut up.
You're going somewhere.

01:25.233 --> 01:26.286
Oh, my God.

01:26.618 --> 01:28.000
He's meeting her right now.

01:31.996 --> 01:33.955
- Where is Barney going?
- Yeah.

01:34.081 --> 01:35.824
We're not even in Manhattan anymore.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.498
Where's this girl live?

01:37.667 --> 01:40.761
We're talking about a woman
who's gotten Barney Stinson to commit.

01:40.886 --> 01:42.391
I'm guessing Narnia.

01:43.798 --> 01:45.018
He's stopping.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.777 --> 01:59.701
- What are you guys doing here?
- Where is she?

01:59.827 --> 02:01.558
- Who?
- Your girlfriend.

02:04.382 --> 02:06.790
You really don't have a type,
do you?

02:08.580 --> 02:09.737
These are my friends.

02:12.732 --> 02:13.698
Guys,

02:13.824 --> 02:15.163
this is Loretta.

02:15.456 --> 02:17.920
- My mom.
- It's so nice to meet you.

02:18.247 --> 02:20.095
I feel like I already know you all.

02:20.402 --> 02:23.192
Barney goes on and on about you
every day when we talk.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.870
You call your mom every day?

02:27.309 --> 02:28.313
Mom!

02:29.930 --> 02:32.019
So that's what you were being
all secretive about?

02:32.144 --> 02:35.118
You didn't want us to know
you're a big old mama's boy.

02:35.858 --> 02:38.926
Yep, you got me.
Well, guess you guys can leave.

02:43.615 --> 02:45.328
Who are all these people?

02:48.856 --> 02:50.511
I'd like you to meet Betty...

02:50.636 --> 02:51.688
my wife.

02:54.325 --> 02:56.040
And my son Tyler.

02:57.548 --> 02:59.999
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

03:12.905 --> 03:16.083
Betty and I are gonna get dinner ready.
There'll be plenty for everyone.

03:16.361 --> 03:17.642
But remember you,

03:17.768 --> 03:20.273
only one helping of meatloaf
after what Dr. Grossbard

03:20.398 --> 03:23.132
- said about your cholesterol.
- This one wants me to live forever.

03:23.258 --> 03:23.992
Guilty.

03:25.124 --> 03:26.796
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

03:26.965 --> 03:29.725
- I love you three!
- Get out of here, you little scamp!

03:32.240 --> 03:35.331
- So, I'll see you guys back at the bar?
- What the hell, Barney?

03:35.619 --> 03:37.486
OK, it's a long story.

03:38.302 --> 03:41.107
As you know, my father
had to leave my mom

03:41.233 --> 03:44.245
when I was a baby because he got hired
as the host of The Price is Right.

03:44.631 --> 03:47.258
- It was a very good show.
- Bob Barker is your father.

03:47.426 --> 03:51.244
She had to raise
my brother and me by herself.

03:51.487 --> 03:54.441
And her only wish was for her sons

03:54.567 --> 03:57.132
not to wind up alone, like she was.

03:57.741 --> 04:00.313
Then about seven years ago,
she got really sick.

04:00.994 --> 04:03.590
It looked like
she wasn't going to make it.

04:03.715 --> 04:06.829
So, I decided to make
her wish come true.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.194
Mom.

04:08.570 --> 04:11.015
This is Betty.
We're engaged.

04:11.837 --> 04:15.618
I hired an actress
to play my fiancÃ©e "Betty".

04:16.238 --> 04:17.564
Her real name's Margaret.

04:17.689 --> 04:20.147
She mostly does off-Broadway theater.
Wonderful actress.

04:20.272 --> 04:22.069
This close to a Tony.
It's all who you know.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.212
It's very political.
I shouldn't get into it.

04:24.338 --> 04:26.044
But there's one problem.

04:26.531 --> 04:29.562
Betty has a slight tendency
to go off-book.

04:29.940 --> 04:32.614
You see, Mom?
I found someone who makes me happy.

04:32.884 --> 04:34.082
Just like you wanted.

04:34.332 --> 04:35.686
That's wonderful.

04:36.641 --> 04:40.317
I just wish I could've stuck around
long enough for grandchildren.

04:41.475 --> 04:42.629
I'm pregnant!

04:47.263 --> 04:49.313
And then my mom got better.

04:50.402 --> 04:53.344
Which was miraculous. But it meant
that I had to keep "Betty"

04:53.470 --> 04:56.711
around and cast a kid
to play my son Tyler.

04:57.181 --> 05:00.402
This is crazy.
You actually cast your own son?

05:00.759 --> 05:01.752
For a while,

05:01.878 --> 05:04.587
I got by borrowing/babysitting
my neighbor's baby.

05:04.933 --> 05:08.097
And this one Christmas,
when my mom was plowed on eggnog,

05:08.223 --> 05:10.944
I got away with a bag of flour
and a Chuckie mask.

05:11.307 --> 05:14.252
But eventually,
I had to hold auditions.

05:15.283 --> 05:16.286
Four,

05:16.680 --> 05:17.710
eight...

05:18.673 --> 05:21.952
13, you can stay.
The rest of you may go.

05:24.348 --> 05:27.141
You said that if I slept with you,
my son would get the part.

05:27.430 --> 05:29.693
Apparently,
I'm a better actor than your kid.

05:30.269 --> 05:32.246
Bring in the 11:00's!

05:32.781 --> 05:36.392
And that's how the role of Tyler
eventually went to...

05:37.080 --> 05:38.083
Grant.

05:39.662 --> 05:41.869
- Come on, Grant seems pretty good.
- You think so?

05:43.127 --> 05:44.768
Watch this.
Hey, Tyler.

05:52.709 --> 05:53.921
- Grant.
- Yeah?

05:55.216 --> 05:57.018
See?
It's like amateur hour over here.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.821
Call me crazy, but child actors
were way better back in the'80s.

06:05.844 --> 06:07.415
It looks like your mom kept

06:07.540 --> 06:09.902
your childhood bedroom
just the way you left it.

06:10.367 --> 06:12.868
<i>That sure is a big poster
of The Karate Kid above your bed.</i>

06:12.993 --> 06:14.509
<i>Karate Kid's a great movie.</i>

06:15.165 --> 06:19.133
It's the story of a hopeful young karate
enthusiast whose dreams and moxie

06:19.417 --> 06:21.915
take him all the way
to the All Valley Karate Championship.

06:22.576 --> 06:25.723
Of course, sadly, he loses
in the final round to that nerd kid.

06:26.896 --> 06:29.488
But he learns an important lesson
about gracefully accepting defeat.

06:30.694 --> 06:33.562
<i>Wait.
When you watch The Karate Kid,</i>

06:33.687 --> 06:36.268
you actually root
for that mean blond boy?

06:36.436 --> 06:39.804
No, I root for the scrawny loser
from New Jersey

06:39.930 --> 06:41.582
who barely even knows karate.

06:42.189 --> 06:46.143
<i>When I watch The Karate Kid,
I root for the karate kid:</i>

06:46.312 --> 06:48.645
Johnny Lawrence
from the Cobra Kai dojo.

06:49.003 --> 06:51.080
Get your head out of your ass, Lily.

06:53.658 --> 06:56.270
Okay, I just figured out
where I know you from.

06:57.266 --> 06:59.935
I saw you perform
at the Disorientation Theater

07:00.060 --> 07:04.011
in Bertolt Brecht's Die Heilige
Johanna der Schlachth felast fall.

07:05.351 --> 07:07.149
You were a revelation!

07:08.185 --> 07:09.646
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:09.771 --> 07:10.664
Thanks.

07:10.833 --> 07:14.180
I wasn't sure. I mean, the point
of Brecht's work, of course, is to...

07:14.348 --> 07:16.187
Alienate the audience.
Sure.

07:16.531 --> 07:19.576
Sorry.
Brecht-o-phile right here!

07:21.117 --> 07:22.631
You really know your theater.

07:23.556 --> 07:27.006
Lady Theater grabbed my heart early on
and she never let go.

07:27.651 --> 07:29.019
Every year at Christmas,

07:29.145 --> 07:31.712
I'd put on a little play for the parents
with all the other kids.

07:32.438 --> 07:35.896
Gee whiz, Santa, do you think
we can take off in this kind of snow?

07:36.065 --> 07:37.320
Cut! Cut!

07:37.813 --> 07:39.453
Cut! Ricky!

07:39.621 --> 07:41.713
Grandma and Grandpa
are gonna be here in half an hour,

07:41.839 --> 07:43.831
and you're still butchering
my words.

07:43.957 --> 07:46.399
Looks like I'm gonna have to write,
direct and star in this thing.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.666
Give me your elf hat.
Go sit.

07:49.530 --> 07:51.420
I always secretly wanted
to be an actor.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.308
It's one of those life dreams
that just slipped away, I guess.

07:54.733 --> 07:57.363
Listen, if you want,
I could give you some tips on acting.

07:57.630 --> 07:59.078
- Really?
- I'd love to.

08:01.137 --> 08:03.168
Acting rule number one...

08:03.904 --> 08:06.108
At least someone's still excited
about acting.

08:07.113 --> 08:08.032
I miss that.

08:08.895 --> 08:10.627
So, you don't like playing
Barney's son?

08:10.896 --> 08:13.305
I hate it.
But what can I do?

08:13.717 --> 08:16.438
- The phone just ain't ringing.
- I know what you mean.

08:16.563 --> 08:17.983
I'm a newscaster.

08:18.108 --> 08:20.586
But I just had to take a job
hosting a local morning show

08:20.712 --> 08:22.720
that airs at 4:30 in the morning.

08:24.279 --> 08:27.455
I just thought I'd be so much
further along by this point, you know?

08:27.580 --> 08:28.579
I'm almost 30.

08:28.901 --> 08:30.754
Come on, you still look great.

08:31.910 --> 08:33.432
I love your nose job.

08:34.095 --> 08:35.650
I never had a nose job.

08:36.010 --> 08:37.049
Right.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.631
Me neither.

08:41.198 --> 08:43.601
I can't believe
we haven't met you before.

08:43.770 --> 08:46.028
Who knew Barney
had such a great mom?

08:46.197 --> 08:47.512
Thanks, dear.

08:47.638 --> 08:51.091
Truth is, I wasn't always
the best mother when I was younger.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.936
Don't say that.
I'm sure you were great.

08:54.543 --> 08:56.447
Yeah, I was a bit of a whore.

08:57.197 --> 08:58.330
Excuse me?

08:58.498 --> 09:00.966
A whore, dear.
A dirty whore.

09:02.180 --> 09:03.309
I'm not proud of it.

09:04.566 --> 09:05.581
But...

09:05.858 --> 09:07.326
still, I had some fun.

09:08.764 --> 09:10.970
There is no thrill equal to...

09:11.096 --> 09:13.926
looking into some guy's eyes
and thinking,

09:14.052 --> 09:16.999
"I don't know your name,
you don't know mine, but...

09:18.037 --> 09:19.403
"for the next eight minutes,

09:19.529 --> 09:21.759
"we are gonna rock
this gas station bathroom

09:21.884 --> 09:23.645
"right off its foundation."

09:25.111 --> 09:28.123
And then just drive off
in opposite directions.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.224
Just keep driving.

09:35.186 --> 09:36.370
Barney's mom?

09:36.496 --> 09:37.539
Loretta.

09:39.196 --> 09:42.058
Anyway, that's,
that's all in the past now.

09:42.979 --> 09:44.672
I did the best I could, but...

09:45.637 --> 09:48.919
sometimes I wonder how Barney
turned out to be so perfect.

09:50.763 --> 09:52.775
You have to tell your mom
the truth, okay?

09:52.901 --> 09:54.549
Listen, she is a sweet,

09:54.674 --> 09:58.461
caring, slightly too graphic woman
who deserves better.

09:59.090 --> 10:01.306
No way. The truth would kill her.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.390
I don't feel right

10:03.516 --> 10:06.011
about lying to such
a kindhearted woman, okay?

10:07.126 --> 10:08.671
She reminds me of my own mother.

10:10.542 --> 10:12.520
- What?
- Kindhearted?

10:12.957 --> 10:16.035
Remember in our wedding vows
when I said we'd be together forever?

10:16.999 --> 10:20.620
On our way back up the aisle,
your mother leaned in and she said,

10:20.891 --> 10:24.154
"Not forever, sweetie.
Marshall's going to heaven."

10:24.942 --> 10:27.727
- She was making a joke.
- She hates me, Marshall.

10:27.853 --> 10:29.323
But that's okay because...

10:29.728 --> 10:30.556
Never mind.

10:31.940 --> 10:33.903
What were you gonna say?

10:34.124 --> 10:37.316
Nothing. Do you want to go do it
in Barney's childhood bedroom again?

10:37.779 --> 10:40.305
- On the race car bed?
- Handles great, buddy.

10:41.210 --> 10:44.866
Look, Lily, if today has taught us
nothing else, it's that

10:45.034 --> 10:47.545
honesty is important
when it comes to family.

10:48.592 --> 10:51.201
Now, whatever you're feeling
towards my mother,

10:51.703 --> 10:54.483
we've been together
for 12 years, baby.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.880
- I think that I can handle it.
- Really?

11:01.085 --> 11:02.405
I hate your mom.

11:03.914 --> 11:04.967
Guess what?

11:05.455 --> 11:06.541
I hate you!

11:10.397 --> 11:11.940
Two minute warning for meatloaf!

11:12.321 --> 11:13.278
Meatloaf?

11:14.039 --> 11:15.329
Tyler no likey!

11:18.301 --> 11:20.436
We have been over this
a million times!

11:20.561 --> 11:23.739
- You are not getting a catchphrase!
- But it's funny.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.338
I am not afraid to recast.

11:28.134 --> 11:30.721
Now go memorize your lines
for the big dinner scene.

11:32.821 --> 11:34.912
Wait. So you wrote the dinner
we're about to have?

11:35.087 --> 11:36.716
Just a short script.

11:36.841 --> 11:38.982
Just things that will make
my mom happy to hear.

11:39.108 --> 11:40.226
What kind of things?

11:40.395 --> 11:42.235
And I really thought

11:42.548 --> 11:44.579
Barney had forgotten
our anniversary.

11:44.747 --> 11:49.013
So I storm out to the backyard,
and there's smoke coming out of my ears.

11:49.182 --> 11:51.984
Nostrils flaring. Her nostrils flare
when she gets mad. I love it.

11:52.743 --> 11:54.914
Doing it right now.
Doing it right now!

11:55.498 --> 11:57.289
You better stop, mister!

11:57.415 --> 11:59.976
Sorry, sorry, boo bear. Continue.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.655
This is what you're actually
like in a relationship.

12:03.309 --> 12:05.773
So I storm out
to the backyard and...

12:07.008 --> 12:08.849
candles everywhere...

12:10.021 --> 12:11.191
and a string quartet.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.748
- Can you believe that?
- No, not even slightly.

12:15.698 --> 12:18.263
What about my little Ty-Ty.
What have you been up to?

12:18.828 --> 12:19.891
Funny story:

12:20.016 --> 12:22.908
just the other night,
this little rascal had a nightmare.

12:23.357 --> 12:25.192
When he came in
to tell us what it was about,

12:25.318 --> 12:27.066
do you remember
what you said, champ?

12:31.602 --> 12:32.605
Page four.

12:36.727 --> 12:40.356
The dinosaur bones in the museum
came to life and started chasing me?

12:40.627 --> 12:43.201
Thanks a lot, buddy.
I didn't need to sleep tonight.

12:45.166 --> 12:47.155
Tyler said, "My nightmare was

12:47.280 --> 12:50.135
"that you and Mommy didn't
know how much I loved you.

12:50.260 --> 12:52.701
"So I wanted to come in
and tell you it was this much."

12:55.382 --> 12:56.886
That's so sweet.

12:57.055 --> 12:58.911
We're a sweet happy family.

12:59.037 --> 13:01.632
'm gonna grab some ice cream
from the freezer downstairs

13:01.758 --> 13:04.139
and then we'll all hit
the sundae bar in the kitchen.

13:08.350 --> 13:10.543
Not a weak link in that scene.

13:10.668 --> 13:11.782
Bravo.

13:11.951 --> 13:14.904
Back off, Barney.
You have no idea how hard it is

13:15.030 --> 13:16.553
to do a job that's beneath you.

13:18.257 --> 13:20.987
I really enjoyed your thing
about the dinosaur bones.

13:21.158 --> 13:23.207
Can we please stop talking
about the dinosaur bones?

13:25.461 --> 13:26.846
Just go eat your sundae.

13:27.099 --> 13:29.870
I can't.
I'm lactose-intolerant.

13:31.115 --> 13:33.542
Guess who's not
lactose-intolerant? Tyler.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.381
Tyler is gonna go in there

13:36.506 --> 13:39.038
and enjoy every last bite.

13:39.331 --> 13:40.780
Ice cream time, gang.

13:40.950 --> 13:41.953
Yummers!

13:44.569 --> 13:45.426
My God!

13:48.095 --> 13:49.428
Tyler no likey.

13:49.976 --> 13:52.067
You're not getting a catchphrase.

13:56.765 --> 13:58.062
I don't understand.

13:58.586 --> 13:59.589
I do.

14:02.917 --> 14:04.256
Follow my lead.

14:04.425 --> 14:05.429
I've...

14:06.122 --> 14:07.503
been betrayed

14:07.833 --> 14:09.193
by my best friend.

14:09.362 --> 14:11.076
How could you do this, Ted?

14:12.007 --> 14:13.629
Think about poor Tyler

14:14.337 --> 14:16.642
bravely trying to hold back tears.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.963
It's okay, son, you can cry.

14:22.270 --> 14:23.273
Cry!

14:24.791 --> 14:27.354
I don't want my mommy
and daddy to get divorced!

14:32.187 --> 14:36.100
What could you possibly have
to say for yourself?

14:37.625 --> 14:39.279
Acting rule number one:

14:39.700 --> 14:41.454
"Don't be afraid to improvise."

14:43.052 --> 14:44.908
Was it me who betrayed you,

14:46.064 --> 14:48.091
or you who betrayed me?

14:48.988 --> 14:50.194
I'm sorry. What?

14:51.206 --> 14:52.711
Acting rule number five:

14:53.102 --> 14:56.032
"Invent a rich back story
for your character."

14:56.851 --> 14:58.932
November 14th, 1998.

15:00.225 --> 15:02.637
The overnight train to Monte Carlo.

15:04.012 --> 15:05.766
I was in the billiards car

15:06.332 --> 15:09.030
hustling some Algerians
out of few thousand dinar,

15:09.961 --> 15:13.205
when you seduced my fiancÃ©e!

15:14.296 --> 15:17.442
Who is blind and thought
you were me.

15:19.242 --> 15:21.792
What in God's name
are you talking about?

15:22.398 --> 15:23.718
Acting rule number eight:

15:24.135 --> 15:25.978
Don't be afraid to get physical.

15:28.422 --> 15:30.171
You know damn well
what I'm talking about!

15:30.341 --> 15:31.417
No, I don't!

15:32.966 --> 15:34.377
Yes, you do! And by God,

15:34.502 --> 15:37.044
I'll hear you say it, scoundrel!

15:38.323 --> 15:39.994
Mom, can you give us a sec?

15:42.770 --> 15:45.391
There's chocolate and butterscotch.

15:45.660 --> 15:48.392
There's various kinds
of sprinkles and marshmallows.

15:51.228 --> 15:52.717
Have you lost your mind?!

15:53.445 --> 15:55.603
You were amazing!

15:55.869 --> 15:58.700
You completely just became
that character.

15:58.868 --> 16:00.698
Honestly,
I wasn't so much playing Ted

16:00.823 --> 16:02.925
as I was just trying
to get out of Ted's way.

16:03.598 --> 16:05.563
What is wrong with you people?

16:05.731 --> 16:07.947
How am I ever gonna
explain this to my mother?

16:08.116 --> 16:10.810
Maybe it's time
to tell her the truth.

16:11.339 --> 16:14.018
I don't know, Lily.
Sometimes, honesty leads people

16:14.144 --> 16:17.782
to say mean things about a woman
who always took special care of me

16:17.907 --> 16:19.788
because I was the
runt of the family.

16:20.516 --> 16:23.145
For crying out loud,
I'm only six-four!

16:26.350 --> 16:27.918
How good was my crying?

16:28.044 --> 16:29.875
You nailed it.
See?

16:30.043 --> 16:33.431
Even at a gig you hate,
you still managed to love what you do.

16:34.392 --> 16:36.778
Maybe that's how it will be
for you at your new job.

16:37.203 --> 16:39.328
- You think so?
- I know so.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.377
Thanks, Grant.

16:41.928 --> 16:43.965
You're pretty smart, you know that?

16:49.090 --> 16:50.244
Sorry! Sorry!

16:50.622 --> 16:52.596
Thought I was picking up
on something.

16:54.448 --> 16:55.818
Honey, are you okay?

16:56.238 --> 16:59.040
Look, Mom,
there's something I have to tell you.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.178
Something I should have
told you a long time ago.

17:07.650 --> 17:08.705
Tyler is dying.

17:10.172 --> 17:12.385
And Betty said that when he goes,

17:12.510 --> 17:13.974
she's gonna off herself.

17:14.343 --> 17:16.781
So that's probably
all gonna go down pretty soon.

17:16.951 --> 17:18.079
Oh, my God!

17:20.271 --> 17:21.827
None of that is true!

17:22.640 --> 17:23.896
The truth is, I...

17:27.377 --> 17:30.701
The truth is Betty and Tyler
are actors

17:30.826 --> 17:33.603
that I hired
to pretend to be my family.

17:34.159 --> 17:35.025
What?

17:35.592 --> 17:38.253
I just wanted you to think
I had the life

17:38.378 --> 17:40.717
you wanted for me.
I wanted you to be proud of me.

17:42.368 --> 17:45.027
I know it sounds crazy,
and I am so sorry, Mom.

17:45.584 --> 17:47.705
So Betty is not your wife?

17:49.650 --> 17:51.081
Thank God!

17:51.399 --> 17:53.436
I do not like that woman.

17:54.469 --> 17:56.135
- Really?
- Yes.

17:56.835 --> 17:58.313
And Tyler...

17:59.191 --> 18:02.470
I know I'm his grandma
and I'm supposed to love him,

18:02.937 --> 18:04.129
but I hate that kid.

18:04.255 --> 18:05.573
"Tyler no likey!"

18:05.698 --> 18:07.496
- What the hell is that?
- Right?

18:07.959 --> 18:11.557
Those fake friends of yours out there,
I just wanted to shoot myself.

18:12.910 --> 18:14.978
I know!
Aren't they horrible?

18:16.044 --> 18:18.000
So really, really, you're not mad?

18:18.555 --> 18:21.766
I'm just confused. I don't know
why you thought you had to do this.

18:23.106 --> 18:25.457
Barney, I love you, perfect
family or no perfect family.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.415
I love you no matter what.

18:28.138 --> 18:30.023
- Really?
- Really.

18:36.111 --> 18:38.184
I am so relieved

18:38.756 --> 18:41.705
because the truth is
I am as far from married

18:41.830 --> 18:43.712
as a human being can possibly be.

18:43.837 --> 18:46.663
My history with women
would shock and appall you.

18:47.215 --> 18:48.846
Doesn't matter.
I still love you.

18:49.051 --> 18:51.516
Seriously, you can't imagine
the things I have done.

18:52.045 --> 18:54.619
Barney, when you were three,
I left you with a babysitter

18:54.744 --> 18:57.378
and spent three weeks
with Grand Funk Railroad

18:57.503 --> 18:59.301
being passed around like a bong.

18:59.947 --> 19:00.950
Mommy!

19:02.208 --> 19:03.586
Just do me a favor.

19:03.712 --> 19:05.845
If you ever do meet someone special,

19:05.970 --> 19:08.223
don't run away from it.
Don't be me.

19:08.957 --> 19:10.739
Take a shot at it, will you?

19:12.776 --> 19:13.830
Cab's here.

19:17.393 --> 19:18.396
I'll try.

19:19.775 --> 19:23.363
<i>And so ended one of the strangest
afternoons of our lives.</i>

19:24.576 --> 19:26.761
And I just wanted to say to you,

19:26.996 --> 19:29.078
if I ever seemed cold

19:29.328 --> 19:31.841
or unwelcoming, I'm sorry.

19:32.486 --> 19:33.782
Who's she talking to?

19:33.951 --> 19:34.955
My mom.

19:35.707 --> 19:39.027
It would mean a lot to me
if you and I could be closer.

19:40.290 --> 19:43.686
Now take a deep breath like this next
thing is gonna be hard to say.

19:46.817 --> 19:47.924
I love you.

19:48.094 --> 19:49.248
I love you...

19:50.059 --> 19:50.815
Mom.

19:52.235 --> 19:53.239
... Mom.

19:54.717 --> 19:56.210
Now pretend I said something nice.

19:56.379 --> 19:58.094
Now pretend I said something nice.

19:59.350 --> 20:00.353
I mean,

20:00.599 --> 20:03.909
that's very nice
of you to say, Judy.

20:05.689 --> 20:07.759
You, too.
Speak soon.

20:15.308 --> 20:17.720
Let me get this straight.
You're really telling me

20:17.846 --> 20:19.650
<i>that when you watch The Karate Kid,</i>

20:19.775 --> 20:21.358
you don't root for Daniel-san?

20:23.451 --> 20:26.311
<i>- Who do you root for in Die Hard?
- Hans Gruber,</i>

20:26.460 --> 20:28.339
charming international bandit.

20:28.465 --> 20:30.221
At the end, he died hard.

20:30.412 --> 20:32.007
He's the title character.

20:32.542 --> 20:34.657
<i>Okay, The Breakfast Club?</i>

20:35.867 --> 20:37.874
The teacher running detention.

20:38.251 --> 20:40.314
He's the only guy
in the whole movie wearing a suit.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.955
<i>I got one.
Terminator.</i>

20:43.835 --> 20:45.963
What's the name of the movie, Robin?

20:46.789 --> 20:49.417
Who among us didn't shed a tear

20:49.542 --> 20:51.970
when his little red eye
went out at the end

20:52.096 --> 20:54.331
and he didn't get
to kill those people?

20:56.315 --> 20:58.070
I'm sorry.
That movie...

20:59.423 --> 21:02.031
I am never watching a movie
with you ever again.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.291
They didn't even try to help him!
