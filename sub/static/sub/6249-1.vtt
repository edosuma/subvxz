00:08.453 --> 00:12.287
What I'm saying is, in this world
there's the visceral and the ineffable.

00:12.373 --> 00:16.001
- Nobody's totally un-effable.
- Ha! Virgins are.

00:16.093 --> 00:20.723
- But you're the opposite of un-effable.
- Ineffable. It doesn't mean what you think.

00:20.813 --> 00:24.931
- It means you can't describe it in words.
- Describe what? Like sex?

00:27.493 --> 00:29.563
You two have zero vocab skills.

00:29.653 --> 00:32.850
You're bitter
cos you're the designated driver.

00:32.933 --> 00:36.403
What's that even mean - "degsinated"?

00:36.893 --> 00:39.248
What the hell is that?

00:42.933 --> 00:46.926
Male, mid-30s, attachment sites
suggest he was well-muscled,

00:47.013 --> 00:49.732
probably manual labour,
not weight-training.

00:49.813 --> 00:51.644
OK. What killed him?

00:51.733 --> 00:56.204
The sternal ribs are subluxated
at both the spine and the sternum.

00:56.293 --> 00:58.966
Indicating that he was crushed?

00:59.053 --> 01:01.851
Not crushed. Pinned.

01:02.333 --> 01:06.645
Smothered,
perhaps in an industrial accident.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.566
This the guy Bones is checking out
to replace Zack?

01:09.653 --> 01:13.362
- Clark Edison, Special Agent Seeley Booth.
- Hey, what's up?

01:13.453 --> 01:17.492
Bones - that's funny. That's what
all my friends called me back in college.

01:17.573 --> 01:21.646
Yeah, I like him.
You got a minute? One minute?

01:21.733 --> 01:24.725
Oh, are you going to a crime scene?
Do you need me?

01:24.813 --> 01:27.202
I'll let you know.

01:27.293 --> 01:31.081
- Did I get it right?
- Construction worker foundation collapse.

01:31.173 --> 01:36.042
- But I'm not impressing her.
- I'm still not certain what she thinks of me.

01:38.613 --> 01:40.843
- Why am I here?
- You used to like field work.

01:40.933 --> 01:45.449
- No car fires, no tanker trucks full of acid...
- You were insistent.

01:45.533 --> 01:50.971
- Don't tell me I'm out here for a simple...
- Now I can't get you out of your lab coat.

01:51.053 --> 01:53.647
With Zack gone,
I'm needed at the Jeffersonian.

01:53.733 --> 01:58.488
That kid seemed pretty good
with the sublixicated sternicalum... thing.

01:58.573 --> 02:01.565
- You used to correct me.
- Why am I here, Booth?

02:02.013 --> 02:06.484
Foster, get a backboard.
We got one we gotta stabilise.

02:07.133 --> 02:08.964
<i>- </i> Whoa...
- Mm-hm.

02:09.053 --> 02:13.251
So, it's been three months
since Zack shipped off to Iraq?

02:13.333 --> 02:17.406
- Uh-huh.
- How hard could it be to replace him?

02:18.053 --> 02:20.044
Male, Caucasian...

02:20.133 --> 02:22.693
I'm just saying -
you in the lab, me in the field...

02:22.773 --> 02:25.571
We are not working
at our full symbiotic potential.

02:25.653 --> 02:30.966
Late teens, early 20s,
completely devoid of flesh or odour.

02:31.053 --> 02:34.807
It seems like maybe
you don't wanna work with me any more.

02:34.893 --> 02:38.203
- I work with you.
- You know what I mean, Bones.

02:38.293 --> 02:43.731
- How did this skull get here?
- Ask our eyewitness. Come on.

02:43.813 --> 02:46.088
Let's go, buddy.

02:46.173 --> 02:49.324
- I'm not high.
- Neither am I. Why is he telling me that?

02:49.413 --> 02:52.211
The car reeked of dope.
Tell her what happened.

02:52.293 --> 02:57.048
I was driving behind a dump truck and...
that came flying off the back.

02:57.133 --> 03:00.091
- You think the skeleton is still in the truck?
- No.

03:00.173 --> 03:04.052
- Why?
- It didn't come flying out, it came flying off.

03:04.133 --> 03:06.488
- It bounced.
- Oh, bouncing skull.

03:06.573 --> 03:10.725
Perhaps you were under the influence
of tetrahydrocannabinol.

03:10.813 --> 03:12.212
- What?
- Weed.

03:12.293 --> 03:16.650
I wasn't high. I'm the designated driver.
You can piss-test me if you want.

03:16.733 --> 03:19.042
It's possible.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.727
If the truck were travelling
at a certain speed,

03:21.813 --> 03:27.843
a wind vortex or sheer could occur
capable of flinging the skull like...

03:27.933 --> 03:29.810
What?

03:30.373 --> 03:33.763
- What, Booth?
- Bones.

03:35.053 --> 03:38.932
Why would anyone
throw a skull off an overpass?

03:40.333 --> 03:44.167
So your husband signed his name
to the marriage licence with an X.

03:44.253 --> 03:45.368
Yeah.

03:45.453 --> 03:48.206
So you married a guy
without knowing his name.

03:48.293 --> 03:51.251
It was Fiji. OK?
I was on vacation.

03:51.333 --> 03:56.088
I'm... I'm not being judgmental,
I'm just trying to ascertain the facts.

03:56.173 --> 03:59.848
Did you consummate the marriage?

03:59.933 --> 04:04.449
Full moon, tropics... Yeah,
there was definite consummation activity.

04:04.533 --> 04:09.129
- We already looked into annulment.
- It requires consent from both parties.

04:09.213 --> 04:15.243
Which is why we need a private investigator -
to find the "husband" so we can get married.

04:15.333 --> 04:20.123
I'll need any description you can provide
of your husband - details, dates, photographs,

04:20.213 --> 04:22.681
uh... who else was there.

04:22.773 --> 04:26.163
Tall. Yes.

04:26.253 --> 04:28.244
Muscular.

04:29.173 --> 04:31.926
Black.
That's all I've got.

04:32.013 --> 04:34.402
You know what?
I think his name had a B in it.

04:34.493 --> 04:39.772
Actually, it could've been a K.
You know what? I could make you a sketch.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.522
Well?

04:44.613 --> 04:48.401
Scoring patterns on the forehead,
cheekbones, around the nose.

04:48.493 --> 04:51.246
- I meant Clark Edison.
- Who's Clark Edison?

04:51.333 --> 04:56.487
The brilliant forensic anthropologist who'd
bite off his own arm to be your assistant.

04:56.573 --> 04:59.531
I haven't decided yet.
Is that a problem?

04:59.613 --> 05:03.686
- No. I want you to be certain of your choice.
- Thank you.

05:03.773 --> 05:07.163
It's just that you've turned down
17 applicants already.

05:07.253 --> 05:10.643
It's a rarefied discipline.
There aren't many more candidates.

05:10.733 --> 05:13.566
I'll cover the lab work
until I find the right person.

05:13.653 --> 05:16.451
This is good.
The first time you've called in weeks.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.967
- There's scoring on the skull.
- <i>Scoring?</i>

05:19.053 --> 05:21.886
- Yes. Scrapes.
- Yeah, I know what "scoring" means.

05:21.973 --> 05:26.967
The scraping is uniform in spacing, but not
in depth, which suggests an ungual pattern.

05:27.053 --> 05:32.923
- What's an "uncle" pattern?
- No, ungual. G... Ungual.

05:33.013 --> 05:36.210
How do I say this
in a way that makes sense to Booth?

05:36.293 --> 05:39.729
- Something chewed on the skull.
- Oh. Like a bear or a dog.

05:39.813 --> 05:42.043
Human, Booth.
Dr Brennan is saying human.

05:42.133 --> 05:47.207
In the vernacular, our victim's face
was chewed off by a cannibal.

05:50.613 --> 05:51.602
OK.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.074

06:21.853 --> 06:25.687
The accident was called in by a trucker
who saw it in his rear-view mirror.

06:25.773 --> 06:28.651
- The driver of the reefermobile...
- "Reefermobile"?

06:28.733 --> 06:31.725
...identified said truck
from which the skull rebounded

06:31.813 --> 06:34.452
before said skull
lodged in his windshield.

06:34.533 --> 06:38.242
The truck dumped its contents
at a municipal landfill near Salisbury.

06:38.333 --> 06:42.884
We need a warrant to shut down the landfill
and comb it for body parts.

06:42.973 --> 06:49.924
You think a cannibal is tossing body parts off
of overpasses into passing dump trucks?

06:50.013 --> 06:54.370
Well, we only got a head,
so the rest has got to be somewhere.

06:55.573 --> 06:57.086
OK.

06:58.333 --> 07:00.972
-  What am I looking at?
- It's an osteoma.

07:01.053 --> 07:04.125
A bone spur that grows
from the skull into the sinus cavity.

07:04.213 --> 07:06.852
Clark found it.
I gave him the x-rays to analyse.

07:06.933 --> 07:11.211
An osteoma that size can cause headaches,
infected sinuses, maybe worse.

07:11.293 --> 07:15.252
Osteomas are every bit as distinctive
as fingerprints or retinas.

07:15.333 --> 07:19.326
We'll check with local ear, nose and throat
surgeons, see if he sought help.

07:19.413 --> 07:21.404
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

07:22.053 --> 07:26.126
The FBI forensics team
just delivered, like, a million bone chips.

07:26.213 --> 07:30.809
- From the landfill?
- And Booth says there's more to come.

07:33.413 --> 07:37.486
- You are not gonna hire that one either.
- I haven't made up my mind yet.

07:37.573 --> 07:42.772
It just prolongs this lame excuse for you
not to go out into the field with Booth.

07:42.853 --> 07:44.252
Why would I do that?

07:44.333 --> 07:47.962
Because, when Hodgins and I
ran away from our wedding,

07:48.053 --> 07:50.851
we left you and Booth
standing at the altar.

07:50.933 --> 07:54.289
And that iconic image
totally freaked you out.

07:54.373 --> 07:56.250
No, it didn't.

07:56.333 --> 08:01.009
Sweetie, this is not where you try to
keep a secret and I ferret out the truth.

08:01.093 --> 08:05.564
This is where I tell you something that's true
so you can catch up to your own reality.

08:05.653 --> 08:08.372
Ange, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

08:08.453 --> 08:10.808
Which actually
proves my point.

08:10.893 --> 08:16.889
I love you to pieces, sweetie. I know you love
me back. We'll talk again when you catch up.

08:19.853 --> 08:22.128
Well, most of these
are animal remains.

08:22.213 --> 08:24.249
Some are crockery and plastic.

08:24.333 --> 08:27.882
- We got anything human?
- I'll have to go through it and see.

08:27.973 --> 08:31.204
- I could do that, Dr Brennan.
- Yeah. Clark could do that.

08:31.293 --> 08:35.206
There's too many.
This could take days, even with the two of us.

08:35.293 --> 08:38.205
Oh, come on. Is that true?

08:38.293 --> 08:40.010
Huh?

08:43.053 --> 08:47.046
You're kind of putting me
in an awkward position there.

08:51.413 --> 08:53.404
Zack would've told me.

08:59.693 --> 09:02.491
How hard can it be
to replace one weirdo squint?

09:02.573 --> 09:07.203
- I'd hire Clark, but it's not my call.
- It is. Bones has had enough time. Hire him.

09:07.293 --> 09:11.650
Usually when you get all blustery,
it's cos you think something's your fault.

09:11.733 --> 09:14.930
Yeah, well,
I did arrest her father for murder.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.607
She could be
having trouble with that.

09:17.693 --> 09:21.652
Yeah. Exposing a parent to the death penalty
can chill a partnership.

09:21.733 --> 09:25.009
I asked Bones if that was a problem.
She said no.

09:25.093 --> 09:28.130
I gotta wonder if, deep down,
anybody's that rational.

09:28.213 --> 09:30.408
You're not reassuring me, Camille.

09:30.493 --> 09:34.452
If you want reassurance,
find someone who's not such a good friend.

09:38.053 --> 09:40.009
Booth.

09:40.093 --> 09:42.561
Yeah, OK. On my way.
We got an identity.

09:43.253 --> 09:47.724
This is the skull in the windshield. These are
x-rays from an ear, nose and throat specialist.

09:47.813 --> 09:50.407
OK. Are we sure
this is Gavin Nichols?

09:50.493 --> 09:52.768
The osteoma's a perfect match.

09:52.853 --> 09:57.369
Prodigy violinist disappears. A month later
his skull bounces off a garbage truck?

09:57.453 --> 10:01.207
Obviously we're looking for someone
who really hates classical music.

10:01.293 --> 10:04.524
Look - final performance
was at the Library of Congress.

10:04.613 --> 10:08.526
Didn't show up to meet his girlfriend
for drinks at the Hay-Adams.

10:08.613 --> 10:12.208
- Nobody ever saw him again.
- And a violin worth $3 million.

10:12.293 --> 10:16.650
A 22-year-old willowy kid walking around
with three-million bucks under his arm?

10:16.733 --> 10:22.729
- I'm telling you, easy pickings.
- A cannibalistic violin thief who eats faces?

10:23.213 --> 10:26.125
It's a stretch.

10:26.213 --> 10:29.683
But... see how this is?

10:30.253 --> 10:32.244
Us working together?

10:32.333 --> 10:34.289
Very symbiotic.

10:34.373 --> 10:37.490
You said that already.
What is it? The word of the day?

10:37.573 --> 10:42.010
I'd, uh... like you to be there
when I question the girlfriend.

10:42.093 --> 10:44.687
Can't. I found microscopic grit on the skull.

10:44.773 --> 10:47.128
That's Hodgins' territory.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.886
Hodgins works for me.
That makes it <i>my</i> territory.

10:49.973 --> 10:53.761
Take Angela to do that thing
where she looks at photos and reads minds.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.890
Actually, what she does is
read minute facial indica...

10:56.973 --> 10:59.692
Joke, Dr Brennan.

11:03.653 --> 11:07.646
How did you meet Gavin Nichols,
Miss Trattner?

11:07.733 --> 11:13.091
I'm a cellist with the National Symphony.
He guested as first violinist three years ago.

11:13.173 --> 11:18.327
Check out the photo
of them kissing, huh? Mega tongue action.

11:18.413 --> 11:21.246
<i>How long did you</i>
<i>know him this way?</i>

11:22.373 --> 11:26.366
- Within a couple of weeks of meeting.
-  He was barely shaving then.

11:26.453 --> 11:29.570
Why is she playing squeeze-and-squish
with a 19 year old?

11:29.653 --> 11:32.645
- Squeeze-and-squish?
- I beg your pardon?

11:33.333 --> 11:36.643
- With a 19 year old.
- Gavin pursued me.

11:36.733 --> 11:40.123
His... taste ran to older women.

11:40.213 --> 11:43.523
Miss Trattner, do you think
Gavin was killed for his violin?

11:43.613 --> 11:46.252
No. No one does.

11:46.333 --> 11:49.052
You can't sell it anywhere.

11:49.133 --> 11:52.045
<i>And we'd know by now</i>
<i>if they were trying to ransom it.</i>

11:52.133 --> 11:55.045
Can you think of anyone
who'd want him dead?

11:55.133 --> 11:58.091
- Every violinist in the world.
- Why?

11:58.173 --> 12:02.564
No one had seen left-hand technique
like Gavin's since Franz von Biber.

12:02.653 --> 12:05.565
<i>His little finger</i>
<i>was insured for $10 million.</i>

12:05.653 --> 12:10.932
Great. Thank you, Miss Trattner. Thank you
for your cooperation. You can leave now.

12:11.013 --> 12:14.210
- Wait a minute, Booth.
- Oh, uh... One moment.

12:15.413 --> 12:19.008
Check out her face
in the quartet photo.

12:19.093 --> 12:23.723
Just one more question.
I'm sorry.

12:25.413 --> 12:28.530
What's going on here?

12:28.613 --> 12:31.685
It was impossible
not to watch him when he played.

12:31.773 --> 12:35.288
- You don't look impressed. You look sad.
- Like she lost something.

12:35.373 --> 12:39.082
- Like you've lost him.
- Because she knew he was gonna die.

12:39.173 --> 12:42.688
- Like there was someone else.
- There was?

12:43.133 --> 12:46.443
There was someone else in his life -
someone I need to know about.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.366
Brilliant. You are brilliant.
OK, this time...

12:49.453 --> 12:51.011
- Shh!
- What?

12:51.093 --> 12:56.008
I'm sorry. Nothing.
Just, quietly, who was it, Amelia?

13:06.613 --> 13:09.207
Ask her.

13:13.133 --> 13:15.852
- Rona Sumner?
- Who's Rona Sumner?

13:17.013 --> 13:19.083
Wife of Leo Sumner.

13:21.853 --> 13:25.402
Deputy Director
of the Secret Service.

13:27.893 --> 13:33.013
The particles we found in the skull are
pink syenite. It's the Cadillac of granites.

13:33.093 --> 13:35.653
- How did it get on the skull?
- I don't know.

13:35.733 --> 13:38.531
But pink syenite
is relatively rare.

13:38.613 --> 13:40.569
- How did it get there?
- I don't know.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.645
First I thought it was
a Brazilian stone, sienite balma,

13:43.733 --> 13:48.329
but trace amounts of magnetite and this -
this is crucial - chalcocite

13:48.413 --> 13:54.170
led me to the Omineca Tectonic Belt
in British Columbia, Canada, and voilà.

13:54.253 --> 13:58.087
There's no indication that he was struck,
so how did it get there?

13:58.173 --> 14:03.247
I don't know, but not a lot of pink syenite from
British Columbia has been shipped to DC.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.324
None at all
in the last 100 years.

14:05.413 --> 14:08.007
Perhaps the skull
was dropped on a stone floor?

14:08.093 --> 14:11.972
I don't know.
But I discovered half a dozen sources.

14:12.053 --> 14:15.807
A bridge, some garden walls
on private estates, and one bank building.

14:15.893 --> 14:18.965
- Send the details to Booth.
- Yeah.

14:19.053 --> 14:21.044
Hodgins...

14:21.133 --> 14:25.763
The reason I'm not in the field with Booth
is that I haven't found a replacement for Zack.

14:25.853 --> 14:27.844
There is no replacement for Zack.

14:27.933 --> 14:32.768
He's good with bones,
excellent at math,

14:32.853 --> 14:35.413
he's brilliant
at making contraptions.

14:35.493 --> 14:39.247
And when our experiments blew up,
it was easy to pin the blame on him.

14:39.333 --> 14:42.530
In my book,
all that makes Zack irreplaceable.

14:42.613 --> 14:47.209
Exactly. Which is why I'm stuck in the lab,
not some other reason.

14:48.653 --> 14:52.202
The only thing you can do
is forget about replacing Zack

14:52.293 --> 14:57.083
and find someone who can just...
just help out around here.

14:59.413 --> 15:03.326
Yes, I was intimately involved
with Gavin Nichols.

15:03.413 --> 15:07.929
And, Mr Sumner, I have to ask,
were you aware of your wife's infidelity?

15:08.013 --> 15:12.325
What you really want to ask, Agent Booth,
is if I killed the boy for bedding my wife.

15:12.413 --> 15:15.211
I have a far more interesting question.

15:15.293 --> 15:19.127
Why didn't you come armed with
the biggest, baddest lawyer in town?

15:19.213 --> 15:23.604
- I'm more interested in the killing.
- I did not murder Rona's fiddle player.

15:23.693 --> 15:26.002
Leo and I have no secrets
from each other.

15:26.093 --> 15:30.769
You'd like for us to believe that, because
your husband knew about this dalliance,

15:30.853 --> 15:33.083
there's no motive
for jealousy and murder.

15:33.173 --> 15:37.530
Gavin wasn't my only -
I'll use your word - dalliance.

15:37.613 --> 15:42.448
- And Mr Sumner knew all about them?
- Like Rona said, no secrets.

15:42.533 --> 15:46.765
Would you like names
to see if Leo murdered them as well?

15:46.853 --> 15:50.323
- That'd be peachy.
- Just tell us about Gavin Nichols.

15:50.413 --> 15:52.768
Every salacious detail?

15:52.853 --> 15:55.242
- The highlights, honey.
-  I get it.

15:55.333 --> 15:58.131
That's the part you like, huh?
The play-by-play.

15:58.213 --> 16:01.285
I'm heavily involved in arts patronage.

16:01.373 --> 16:06.447
After I put together the funding
to get Gavin his violin, we slept together.

16:06.533 --> 16:10.492
We met perhaps
once or twice a month after that,

16:10.573 --> 16:13.087
a total of 11 times.

16:13.533 --> 16:15.524
When was the last time you saw him?

16:15.613 --> 16:18.844
The night he disappeared,
at the Library of Congress.

16:18.933 --> 16:21.606
Agent Booth meant sexually.

16:21.693 --> 16:25.971
The night he disappeared,
at the Library of Congress.

16:26.053 --> 16:30.251
Nope. Not buying it. Sorry.
I don't feel them, see?

16:30.333 --> 16:32.324
What Agent Booth means is,

16:32.413 --> 16:37.168
unless you can prove that Mr Sumner
knew about your affair with Gavin Nichols,

16:37.253 --> 16:42.043
this could all have been a story
you cooked up after killing him.

16:48.853 --> 16:52.084
We thought
you might want proof.

16:56.653 --> 17:01.044
Ah. OK. So, the kid and the cougar,
bumping the uglies.

17:11.373 --> 17:15.445
He doesn’t just enjoy hearing about
her sex life, he gets off on watching.

17:15.532 --> 17:17.842
Which explains why
he didn't bring a lawyer.

17:17.933 --> 17:20.163
They didn't murder the kid.

17:25.573 --> 17:29.407
- Where's Bones?
- You arrested Leo Sumner for voyeurism?

17:29.493 --> 17:31.802
- Yeah. She in her office?
- That is awesome.

17:31.893 --> 17:35.329
And really stupid.
I love a self-destructive man with values.

17:35.413 --> 17:37.449
- Where's Bones?
- Right behind you.

17:37.533 --> 17:40.525
Listen, Charlie checked
the places with that red rock.

17:40.613 --> 17:41.648
Pink syenite.

17:41.733 --> 17:45.328
Only one place uses
the pink rock in its foundation -

17:45.413 --> 17:47.563
a deserted bank
on the Anacostia River.

17:47.653 --> 17:50.042
- Bingo, baby.
- Why "Bingo, baby"?

17:50.133 --> 17:52.408
I checked into the ownership
of the place.

17:52.493 --> 17:56.008
- Why "Bingo, baby"?
- Shell companies owning defective titles...

17:56.893 --> 17:59.123
I don't get the significance.

17:59.213 --> 18:02.888
- It's deserted, isolated. It's a fortress.
- Serial-killer heaven.

18:02.973 --> 18:05.362
Look, I want you
to come with me.

18:06.573 --> 18:08.564
I've got work to do here.

18:08.653 --> 18:13.488
Dr Brennan, if this building was used
for some sort of ritual cannibalistic killing -

18:13.573 --> 18:16.724
as indicated by a skull
which has been gnawed upon -

18:16.813 --> 18:21.841
a trained anthropologist's eye
could be crucial to the case.

18:21.933 --> 18:24.572
Rationally speaking.

18:25.693 --> 18:29.766
The bank's been closed for years.
Doors locked. Never a light. Nothing.

18:29.853 --> 18:32.765
- Squatters?
- They made 'em sturdy back then. Look.

18:32.853 --> 18:35.128
It is clean.
No dust, nothing.

18:35.213 --> 18:39.491
DC Building Conservancy is fighting
to keep the place a historical site.

18:39.573 --> 18:42.167
Maybe if you told me
what you were looking for...

18:42.253 --> 18:44.642
Bloodstains,
butcher instruments...

18:44.733 --> 18:48.442
Any place where human remains
would have come in contact with granite.

18:48.533 --> 18:50.683
- Nothing like that up here.
- Up here?

18:50.773 --> 18:52.650
Up here?

18:53.573 --> 18:57.009
Old vault, cut right into
the foundation of the place.

18:57.093 --> 19:01.291
Hermetically sealed,
insectproof, constant humidity...

19:01.373 --> 19:03.933
- It's ideal.
- Yeah, but we gotta get inside.

19:04.013 --> 19:06.004
You want me
to kick down the door?

19:14.213 --> 19:17.046
When I put your old man in jail,
you said you understood.

19:17.133 --> 19:22.253
Don't start again, Booth.
We'll be together as soon as I replace Zack.

19:24.653 --> 19:26.644
How's that going,
by the way?

19:29.733 --> 19:31.963
-  We're in.
- They cracked it.

19:45.973 --> 19:48.362
All right. You got it?

19:49.453 --> 19:51.967
A little bit more. OK.

19:55.053 --> 19:59.524
- Maybe you're mad at me subconsciously.
- What? I don't believe in that.

19:59.613 --> 20:05.210
Something has changed between us.
At least admit that so we could figure it out.

20:05.293 --> 20:09.844
I would, yes, if I actually believed
anything had changed.

20:12.173 --> 20:14.562
Get down!

20:16.013 --> 20:18.402
Why are your eyes closed?

20:19.813 --> 20:22.532
I thought
we were gonna get blown up.

20:23.573 --> 20:26.610
It's just a transmitter.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.730
Now whoever owns this place
knows we're here. Come on.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.963
I'm curious.

20:32.053 --> 20:37.491
In an explosion,
how would shutting your eyes help?

20:37.573 --> 20:39.245
Huh?

20:39.333 --> 20:42.086
It just does, OK, Bones?
It just does.

20:42.173 --> 20:45.529
Now be careful.
We don't know what else is in here.

20:45.613 --> 20:49.891
There's a phrase in Ancient Greek
burned into the back of the vault door.

20:49.973 --> 20:54.091
- What's it say?
- I don't know. It's in Ancient Greek.

20:55.173 --> 20:58.006
Dead languages,
Egyptian art,

20:58.093 --> 21:02.405
Pythagorean mathematics,
Hebrew scriptures,

21:02.493 --> 21:05.212
Gnosticism, cabbala,

21:06.013 --> 21:10.882
alchemy,
druidism, astrology...

21:10.973 --> 21:16.411
Angela can tell us for sure, but I think
these artefacts are museum quality.

21:17.973 --> 21:20.771
Whoa. Bingo, baby.

21:20.853 --> 21:22.969
I found Gavin Nichols' violin.

21:23.053 --> 21:24.247
Bones.

21:25.453 --> 21:28.092
What, Booth?

21:28.173 --> 21:30.164
What did you find?

21:31.053 --> 21:33.442
I... I don't know.

21:44.573 --> 21:47.451
What is it? Silver?

21:51.293 --> 21:54.683
Not all these bones are silver.

22:01.213 --> 22:05.764
It's possible we just found
more of Gavin Nichols.

22:09.133 --> 22:12.045
That's Gavin's violin.
What else you got?

22:12.133 --> 22:16.763
This altar is made of the same pink syenite
we found embedded in Gavin Nichols' skull.

22:16.853 --> 22:21.404
- Where's the rest of him?
- Probably tossed into dump trucks.

22:21.493 --> 22:24.644
All of the bones found here
show teeth marks.

22:24.733 --> 22:27.611
Somebody kidnapped a fiddler
and served him for dinner

22:27.693 --> 22:30.571
in an old bank vault
stuffed with museum pieces?

22:30.653 --> 22:36.046
I think this is high medieval -
Spanish, possibly Calabrian in origin.

22:36.133 --> 22:37.407
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:37.493 --> 22:40.451
12th-century Calabrian?

22:41.853 --> 22:44.492
You know what that means?

22:44.573 --> 22:47.770
The Order of Alcántara?

22:47.853 --> 22:50.447
You have no idea
of the reach of the Illuminati.

22:52.133 --> 22:57.412
Tell you what else. This old bank is an
original vortex point on the triangular grid

22:57.493 --> 23:01.611
designed by the infamous architect of DC,
Pierre Charles L'Enfant.

23:01.693 --> 23:05.322
- The way the skeleton's displayed suggests...
- OK. We get it.

23:05.413 --> 23:08.325
This is the lair
of a cannibalistic secret society.

23:08.413 --> 23:12.008
You don't want my answers?
Don't ask me the questions.

23:12.093 --> 23:16.962
Someone is replacing the silver bones
in this sculpture with human bones.

23:17.053 --> 23:20.523
No way this manubrium and sternum
came from the same person.

23:20.613 --> 23:23.605
- We got a multiple murder?
- Is she pleased?

23:23.693 --> 23:29.165
You could go your whole career without
something this juicy. Who had access?

23:29.253 --> 23:31.926
- The Building Conservancy.
- Run them for priors.

23:32.013 --> 23:34.607
Childhood cat-skinning,
all that.

23:34.693 --> 23:39.483
I'd like permission to move the contents
of this room to the Jeffersonian.

23:39.573 --> 23:42.167
- It's a vault.
- There's room in the basement.

23:42.253 --> 23:48.044
I think this may be one of those "bring
the mountain to Mohammed" situations.

23:51.133 --> 23:53.647
You were married
by John Kakala,

23:53.733 --> 23:58.648
who was the headman of a hamlet
called Nakavala on the island of Vatulolo,

23:58.733 --> 24:03.409
during a feast in honour of
the shark god Dakuwaqa.

24:03.493 --> 24:07.327
- It doesn't sound wrong.
- Can't this man tell you who Angela married?

24:07.413 --> 24:11.292
He's dead. The town was wiped out
by a tsunami, the island is deserted

24:11.373 --> 24:15.332
and no one wants to talk because
the whole place is haunted and cursed.

24:15.413 --> 24:17.404
Of course it is.

24:18.533 --> 24:21.570
Do you happen to remember
any Australians?

24:21.653 --> 24:23.644
OK.

24:23.733 --> 24:29.763
Look, they have this local drink
called kava that is really...

24:30.733 --> 24:34.851
Anyway, when it comes to memory,
no, not so much.

24:34.933 --> 24:38.243
Which is probably why,
when I tried to sketch him...

24:42.133 --> 24:45.011
I only came up with this.

24:47.813 --> 24:50.452
Handsome.
Why Australians?

24:50.933 --> 24:54.448
Well, around the date
of the marriage licence,

24:54.533 --> 24:58.446
there was a tramp steamer out of Adelaide -
the <i>Innocent City-</i>

24:58.533 --> 25:01.366
that may or may not
have been docked in Vatulolo.

25:01.453 --> 25:03.762
Let's track that steamer down.

25:04.213 --> 25:06.886
- It's gonna cost.
- Not an issue.

25:12.573 --> 25:14.564
Thanks.

25:18.053 --> 25:21.409
- You having second thoughts?
- Are you kidding?

25:21.493 --> 25:24.724
Hey. This is great.

25:24.813 --> 25:27.691
Like we're on
some epic adventure.

25:29.053 --> 25:31.044
Adventure?

25:34.453 --> 25:36.728
These are the bones
we found on the altar.

25:36.813 --> 25:41.489
- Can you confirm any are Gavin Nichols'?
- To be positive, we'd have to check DNA.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.962
All right.
Let's get that going.

25:44.053 --> 25:46.613
Bones, you see
what's going on here, right?

25:46.693 --> 25:49.924
- What do you mean?
- You're getting them all to help you now.

25:50.013 --> 25:54.643
- The vault is filled with priceless artefacts.
- Probably stolen from other victims.

25:54.733 --> 25:56.724
It'll take months
to sift through it.

25:56.813 --> 26:00.010
No, you're enabling somebody
with a mental problem.

26:00.093 --> 26:02.288
- Zack.
- No, you! You, Bones.

26:02.373 --> 26:05.763
You're the one
with the mental problem.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.528
Oh, it's Zack!

26:08.613 --> 26:10.126
Oh-ho-ho!

26:13.533 --> 26:17.924
- What are you doing here?
- Can I move back in above your garage?

26:18.013 --> 26:21.722
Are you kidding?
Of course! Come here.

26:23.413 --> 26:27.247
- Welcome home, Zack.
- Did you get wounded or something?

26:27.333 --> 26:29.369
No. They just sent me home.

26:29.453 --> 26:32.331
When can you start work?

26:32.413 --> 26:34.449
Nice meeting you, bub.

26:34.533 --> 26:37.366
If you didn't fill my job,
who's that guy?

26:37.453 --> 26:38.932
Nobody.

26:39.613 --> 26:43.731
- Man! You look like crap.
- Iraq's not a vacation.

26:43.813 --> 26:47.692
I think you look very rakish.
Are you starving?

26:47.773 --> 26:51.288
What I'd like is to get into
whatever you were talking about

26:51.373 --> 26:54.729
before Dr Brennan's
mental problem.

26:58.773 --> 27:03.688
It's hard to concentrate
when you're all staring at me.

27:03.773 --> 27:09.370
- They're happy to see you.
- Depth of scoring suggests it was cooked.

27:09.453 --> 27:11.921
So the victim was dead
when his face was eaten,

27:12.013 --> 27:15.289
which is good, I guess,
given the alternative.

27:15.373 --> 27:18.365
I'm seeing an interesting pattern
in the scoring.

27:18.453 --> 27:20.523
- From the windshield?
- It appears so.

27:20.613 --> 27:26.051
But if you unfocus your eyes and allow
patterns to arise from what looks like chaos...

27:26.133 --> 27:30.092
- Here, here, here.
- I didn't notice that.

27:30.173 --> 27:35.964
This is different from both the gnawing marks
and the damage caused by the windshield.

27:39.173 --> 27:41.368
- What is that?
- I don't know.

27:41.453 --> 27:46.208
- You ran it through the x-ray diffractometer?
- And x-ray microfluorescence.

27:46.293 --> 27:50.525
No trace evidence of anything left in the bone
by whatever etched that groove.

27:50.613 --> 27:52.808
That's our answer, then.

27:52.893 --> 27:55.123
But the answer was nothing.

27:55.453 --> 27:57.842
So our cannibal
has a diamond tooth?

27:57.933 --> 28:02.449
Not the entire tooth.
A diamond inset, left lateral incisor.

28:02.533 --> 28:04.524
It left a distinct mark
on the skull.

28:04.613 --> 28:09.403
So, if someone in the Building Conservancy
or cleaning crew has a diamond in his tooth,

28:09.493 --> 28:13.281
that's our guy.
You got him.

28:13.373 --> 28:17.651
I'd like to be in on it
when you interrogate him.

28:18.333 --> 28:21.006
- What?
- You would?

28:21.093 --> 28:23.971
Why are you surprised?

28:24.053 --> 28:26.851
Are you serious?

28:26.933 --> 28:30.164
I've been trying to get you
out of the lab since Zack left.

28:30.253 --> 28:33.086
- Well, Zack's back, so here I am.
- That simple?

28:33.173 --> 28:36.210
Why? Did Angela
say something to you?

28:36.293 --> 28:39.569
No. Angela?
Why? What?

28:39.653 --> 28:41.962
I told you
this isn't about psychology.

28:42.053 --> 28:44.169
Fine, fine.

28:44.253 --> 28:48.326
Hey, you know what I say?
Welcome home, Zack!

28:48.413 --> 28:51.052
No, it's not just because
you have a diamond tooth.

28:51.133 --> 28:53.601
You don't know
why you're here, Jason?

28:53.693 --> 28:56.844
- That part should be <i>your</i> responsibility.
- Think about it.

28:56.933 --> 28:59.970
You're a smart boy.
You went to a private school.

29:00.053 --> 29:03.250
Six of them.
Got kicked out of every one.

29:03.333 --> 29:06.405
Yeah, for attacking people
in their sleep.

29:06.493 --> 29:09.246
I got counselling.
I'm cured.

29:09.333 --> 29:14.282
You did your little community service
mopping floors for the historical-site people.

29:14.373 --> 29:17.046
- How did you get in the vault?
- At the old bank?

29:17.133 --> 29:22.685
He's not the type to sit beside a vault all night
listening to tumblers through a stethoscope.

29:22.773 --> 29:25.412
He probably found
the combination somewhere.

29:25.493 --> 29:30.089
Nobody can get in the vault.
It's what you call "impregnable".

29:30.173 --> 29:32.164
Not true.

29:33.653 --> 29:37.328
This is the transmitter
we found in the vault.

29:38.653 --> 29:44.523
Normal guy comes across a treasure
in a vault, starts selling it off.

29:44.613 --> 29:46.763
You went a whole different way.

29:54.053 --> 29:56.931
Could you bite this, please?

29:59.013 --> 30:01.766
- No.
- Dr Brennan was only being polite.

30:01.853 --> 30:07.723
We have a warrant for that too, Jason.
So either you bite, or I'll make you.

30:09.573 --> 30:14.363
- What do you need it for?
- The diamond left a mark on the skull.

30:14.453 --> 30:16.887
Yeah, the skull
that you gnawed on.

30:27.373 --> 30:31.048
It's not like chicken or pork,
you know.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.203
People always say that.

30:34.213 --> 30:37.762
It's more like beef.

30:37.853 --> 30:40.048
The face is a little sweeter,

30:40.133 --> 30:42.283
more tender.

30:42.373 --> 30:45.285
The younger the person,
the better.

30:47.533 --> 30:49.524
Except for babies.

30:50.173 --> 30:53.643
Babies taste kind of like fish.

31:00.773 --> 31:03.970
- Have you been to bed yet?
- Iraq is from a different time zone.

31:04.053 --> 31:07.125
I can't seem to sleep right now.

31:07.213 --> 31:10.205
Fibula and tibia of the right leg
are from the same person.

31:10.293 --> 31:12.409
Left femur
from a different person.

31:12.493 --> 31:16.327
Three phalanges and one metacarpal -
essentially a little finger -

31:16.413 --> 31:19.610
are from yet another person,
probably the violinist.

31:19.693 --> 31:23.845
- How can you tell?
- Pressure indicator shows years of practice.

31:23.933 --> 31:27.846
Manubrium and gladiolus originate from
two additional separate people.

31:27.933 --> 31:32.370
And this floating rib -
an anatomically superfluous rib, by the way -

31:32.453 --> 31:34.842
is from yet another human being.

31:34.933 --> 31:37.845
- Ten bones from six separate victims.
- Yes.

31:37.933 --> 31:43.565
Obviously Jason Harkness was collecting
parts from different people to create... What?

31:43.653 --> 31:45.644
I don't know.

31:45.733 --> 31:48.008
There's potential
for a lot of victims.

31:48.093 --> 31:52.166
- But we caught him.
- Yes. <i>We</i> did, Zack.

31:52.253 --> 31:55.529
Dr Brennan says that catching the bad guy
is only part of it.

31:55.613 --> 32:00.926
The rest is knowing absolutely everything
about the evidence.

32:01.013 --> 32:05.484
- Why did they send you back from Iraq?
- I failed to assimilate.

32:05.573 --> 32:10.124
Despite my accomplishments,
I was detrimental to a military team approach.

32:10.213 --> 32:12.408
You're very good
for <i>our</i> team approach.

32:12.493 --> 32:17.089
The army psychiatrist questioned why
the Jeffersonian is the only place I can fit in.

32:17.173 --> 32:19.926
All due respect
to the army psychiatrist,

32:20.013 --> 32:24.564
but that's a hell of a lot more
than some people get.

32:25.333 --> 32:27.642
Go home, Zackaroni.
Get some rest.

32:33.493 --> 32:36.849
Do you recognise
any of these men?

32:37.373 --> 32:40.888
- How is this any better than Angela's sketch?
- That's him.

32:41.813 --> 32:44.930
I mean,
he fits the general silhouette.

32:45.933 --> 32:48.652
You forgot to mention
that he was a giant.

32:48.733 --> 32:54.490
This may be the crew of <i>Innocent City,</i>
scuttled six months after you were married.

32:54.573 --> 32:57.041
His hands are like snow shovels.

32:57.133 --> 33:00.682
The man you're pointing to
is known as Berimbau to his crew mates.

33:00.773 --> 33:03.162
That's it.
His name is Berimbau.

33:03.253 --> 33:07.166
Berimbau is obviously a nickname.
It's a Brazilian flute.

33:07.253 --> 33:11.849
- Did he speak Portuguese, by any chance?
- Yeah, he most definitely had an accent.

33:11.933 --> 33:15.323
I mean,
look at this man!

33:15.413 --> 33:20.806
How hard can it be to find a guy like that?
Probably see him from the space shuttle.

33:20.893 --> 33:23.088
Did Berimbau die
when his ship sank?

33:23.173 --> 33:25.482
Oh, that'd be great.

33:25.573 --> 33:30.408
No! No, what I mean is
we can have him declared dead.

33:30.493 --> 33:31.846
- He didn't die.
- Too bad.

33:31.933 --> 33:36.484
Last time I found him, he was on a Liberian
oil tanker bound for Tierra del Fuego.

33:36.573 --> 33:39.963
Oh. OK.
That narrows it down.

33:40.053 --> 33:44.524
He's a sailor, he's maybe Brazilian
and he's named after a flute.

33:44.613 --> 33:49.607
You know what else narrows it down?
He's a Titan - half man, half god.

33:49.693 --> 33:52.890
I can see why you...

33:52.973 --> 33:56.648
- I mean, I totally... I get it.
- Hodgins, stop it.

33:56.733 --> 34:03.525
Do I keep looking? Because if you just
wait three years, you can declare him dead.

34:03.613 --> 34:06.047
Do you want to wait three years?

34:06.133 --> 34:08.283
Do <i>you?.</i>

34:08.373 --> 34:10.045
Definitely...

34:10.132 --> 34:12.203
absolutely not.

34:13.973 --> 34:17.170
- Me either.
- OK.

34:17.773 --> 34:20.333
Keep searching, Mr Doyley.

34:25.773 --> 34:27.172
Zack! Zack!

34:27.253 --> 34:30.643
- What did he say?
- He had to show us something immediately.

34:30.733 --> 34:33.884
- Show us what?
- He didn't say. That's why we're here.

34:33.973 --> 34:37.010
Look out. Zack! Zack!

34:37.092 --> 34:39.004
Zack!

34:39.092 --> 34:42.802
- Hi. Why are you listening to my chest?
- I thought you were dead.

34:42.893 --> 34:45.965
- Why?
- You're lying on a table for dead people.

34:46.053 --> 34:48.362
- I got tired.
- New rules, OK?

34:48.453 --> 34:51.286
Sleeping is for couches and beds -
stuff like that.

34:51.373 --> 34:54.364
Oh... my... God.

34:54.453 --> 34:56.569
- What?
- I thought you'd wanna know.

34:56.652 --> 35:00.532
- You compared depth and dimension?
- Yes. Three times.

35:00.613 --> 35:04.128
And there's no way that it was
a case of pre- and post-diamond inset?

35:04.213 --> 35:06.169
What? What? What?

35:06.253 --> 35:09.290
The newest bones -
the phalanges and the skull -

35:09.373 --> 35:11.682
bear only the gnaw marks
of Jason Harkness.

35:11.773 --> 35:16.051
One bone - the femur - was gnawed upon
by Jason and a second person.

35:16.133 --> 35:18.283
See the distinct second pattern?

35:18.373 --> 35:22.252
- So Jason invited a guest over for dinner?
- I don't know how to answer that.

35:22.333 --> 35:25.609
- No. Jason was the one invited.
- How do you know?

35:25.693 --> 35:31.006
The oldest bones were gnawed on by another
person with no diamond in his incisor.

35:31.093 --> 35:34.688
Another person?
Not Jason?

35:34.773 --> 35:41.565
There's someone else out there, probably
someone older, who pulled Jason into this.

35:41.653 --> 35:44.326
Good work, Zack.

35:45.093 --> 35:48.051
See why he should never have left?

35:49.453 --> 35:52.445
- Great. Thanks.
- Show them your badge again.

35:52.533 --> 35:57.209
No. They don't see why we have to see Jason
in the middle of the night.

35:57.293 --> 36:00.285
The shift changes in two hours.

36:00.373 --> 36:03.968
Hell, they could make us
wait till morning.

36:09.173 --> 36:10.652
No.

36:10.733 --> 36:13.611
- You weren't upset because Zack was gone.
- Yes, I was.

36:13.693 --> 36:18.847
OK, yeah. But you were more upset that
I didn't stop him from going in the first place.

36:18.933 --> 36:22.209
I could've said to him,
"Iraq is no place for a guy like you."

36:22.293 --> 36:25.922
And he'd never have left.
You could've stopped him.

36:26.013 --> 36:28.322
Why didn't you do that?

36:28.413 --> 36:31.564
Whatever his weirdness,
or whatever you wanna call it...

36:31.653 --> 36:36.044
- I call it genius.
- You know, he's a man.

36:36.133 --> 36:40.888
He's a strange man, but he's a man
who wanted to serve a larger purpose.

36:40.973 --> 36:43.851
- This is some alpha-male rite of passage?
- No.

36:43.933 --> 36:46.049
- You mean go to war?
- Wrong. No.

36:46.133 --> 36:48.249
Zack needed to leave the nest

36:48.333 --> 36:52.645
the way <i>you</i> did when you wanted to leave
the lab and see the world for the first time.

36:52.733 --> 36:58.091
And I helped you do that. How could I stop
Zack doing the same thing in his own way?

36:58.173 --> 37:00.767
Agent Booth.

37:03.453 --> 37:07.731
- We came to wake him, this is what we found.
-  Oh, my God.

37:07.813 --> 37:10.646
We're going to full lockdown.

37:26.373 --> 37:28.170
Booth says you need me.

37:28.253 --> 37:32.326
I noticed that Jason Harkness
arranged his suicide.

37:32.413 --> 37:34.927
If it was a suicide,
someone got him a dagger.

37:35.013 --> 37:39.404
His body is arranged
in the same position as the silver skeleton.

37:39.493 --> 37:42.929
So, Hodgins, you think that's a coincidence?

37:43.013 --> 37:47.882
So suddenly you think
my insane conspiracy ravings are legitimate?

37:47.973 --> 37:49.292
- No.
- Yes.

37:49.373 --> 37:53.685
But obviously there are other insane people
out there who have the same ravings

37:53.773 --> 37:55.764
and we need your insight.

37:55.853 --> 37:57.764
All right.

37:58.773 --> 38:02.448
All right. Both the body
and the silver skeleton

38:02.533 --> 38:05.969
are in the attitude of what
Ancient Greeks called <i>"pharmakos".</i>

38:06.053 --> 38:08.806
It means "scapegoat" or "sacrifice".

38:08.893 --> 38:11.612
So he's being pulled
into the sky against his will?

38:11.693 --> 38:14.207
You mean... aliens?

38:14.293 --> 38:17.365
One definite possibility, yes.

38:17.453 --> 38:21.048
Also, the rapture.
As I tried to tell you before,

38:21.133 --> 38:24.284
most secret societies
have this figure in their origins.

38:24.373 --> 38:26.933
For Freemasons,
it's known as the Widow's Son.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.083
Interesting.

38:29.173 --> 38:31.733
Gavin Nichols lost his father
when he was 12.

38:31.813 --> 38:33.610
A widow's son.

38:33.693 --> 38:37.288
So Jason Harkness killed himself
to keep his secret society secret.

38:37.373 --> 38:40.922
Or was sacrificed.
Hey, all the signs point to it.

38:41.013 --> 38:44.403
The evidence so far
indicates only one other murderer.

38:44.493 --> 38:48.008
This vault's full of evidence.
Who knows where it'll take us?

38:48.093 --> 38:51.642
Deeper than you can imagine.
Probably get us all killed.

38:51.733 --> 38:53.212
Thanks, man.

38:53.293 --> 38:55.807
No, no, Hodgins. Really.

38:56.533 --> 38:59.093
Thanks, man.

38:59.173 --> 39:01.892
Yeah, man.

39:01.973 --> 39:04.168
Be safe.

39:10.773 --> 39:13.651
They translated the motto
on the back of the vault door:

39:13.733 --> 39:16.042
"Will no one help
the Widow's Son?"

39:16.133 --> 39:19.011
- This killer's part of something big.
- Your coffee.

39:19.093 --> 39:23.245
Gavin's violin was in there.
I bet there are belongings from other victims.

39:23.333 --> 39:25.893
- We have to catalogue every item.
- Hot coffee.

39:25.973 --> 39:30.125
After we do a microscopic examination
of each human bone in the skeleton,

39:30.213 --> 39:34.092
we'll take samples and do
an in-depth osteological breakdown.

39:34.173 --> 39:37.882
- We really have a lot to do.
- Yeah, starting with coffee.

39:37.973 --> 39:42.364
An isotope profile will allow us
to narrow down possible geographical...

39:42.453 --> 39:44.842
Hey! It's hot.

39:48.173 --> 39:51.324
You could've burned yourself, Bones.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.362
Thank you.

39:56.773 --> 40:01.005
Listen, this whole serial killer,
it's not gonna be our usual case.

40:01.093 --> 40:03.687
- Why?
- Why? Because it's big and he's bad.

40:03.773 --> 40:08.210
- I don't see what difference that makes.
- You have to slow down, take a breath.

40:08.293 --> 40:11.808
You have to realise this is not a sprint.
It's gonna be a marathon.

40:11.893 --> 40:16.284
"Marathon", Bones, coming from the Greek
meaning really, really, really long run.

40:16.373 --> 40:20.764
That's not how
the word "marathon" originated.

40:20.853 --> 40:24.607
Look, there's something else I gotta know,
and it's important.

40:26.093 --> 40:29.768
- Are we solid?
- You and me? Yeah.

40:29.853 --> 40:33.368
No, not just you and me.
The squints too.

40:33.453 --> 40:38.652
Zack is back. Angela and Hodgins have their
head back in the game. Cam, she's locked in.

40:38.733 --> 40:42.203
- Why are you asking me this?
- Because...

40:42.293 --> 40:45.171
You and me,
we're the centre.

40:46.053 --> 40:48.169
And the centre must hold.

40:48.253 --> 40:51.723
Right.
So, are we gonna hold?

40:52.453 --> 40:54.011
Yeah.

40:55.013 --> 40:56.890
We'll hold.

40:58.573 --> 41:00.882
We're the centre.

41:00.973 --> 41:02.691
The centre.

41:07.373 --> 41:09.568
- What?
- I thought you'd kiss my hand again.

41:09.653 --> 41:13.487
I did not kiss your hand.
You put it over my coffee cup.

41:15.053 --> 41:16.771
- Felt like you kissed it.
- No.

41:16.853 --> 41:19.686
- Felt like it.
- No.

41:56.773 --> 41:58.126
What's that mean?

41:59.453 --> 42:01.444
