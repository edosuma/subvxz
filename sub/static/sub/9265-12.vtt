WEBVTT

00:00.910 --> 00:02.104
I got into Vanderbilt.

00:02.178 --> 00:03.668
Congratulations, baby.

00:03.746 --> 00:05.407
Not that I'll be able to go.

00:05.481 --> 00:06.675
Lyla.
Baby.

00:06.749 --> 00:10.550
The Panthers of Dillon,
Texas, are going to State!

00:10.620 --> 00:11.917
Hey, honey?
Huh?

00:11.989 --> 00:13.183
Look.

00:14.491 --> 00:16.082
Stay here.
No, I'm coming with you.

00:16.158 --> 00:18.354
I don't care what you do, Dad.
All right? Screw you!

00:18.695 --> 00:21.062
No! You don't talk
to me like that!

00:21.132 --> 00:22.656
Joe, stop it!

00:23.368 --> 00:25.802
He hit him. He hit my baby.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:38.183 --> 00:43.143
And here are your soon-to-be State
Champions, the Dillon Panthers.

00:50.563 --> 00:52.121
All right,
I wanna hear you.

00:52.198 --> 00:55.998
State! State! State! State!

00:56.069 --> 00:57.696
State! State!

01:01.275 --> 01:05.108
The problem is, Clint, is that I
just spent the entire weekend

01:05.179 --> 01:08.046
giving support to
J.D. and to Katie.

01:08.416 --> 01:11.909
And now for me to have to turn around
and call Child Protective Services...

01:11.987 --> 01:14.319
You have a mandate,
you're the boss.

01:15.490 --> 01:17.890
Your husband does too,
by the way.

01:22.197 --> 01:24.428
I honestly just don't think
I can do it, Clint.

01:24.500 --> 01:27.230
Tami, you don't know anything.

01:27.303 --> 01:29.362
You think this might've been
the first time it happened,

01:29.439 --> 01:31.202
but you don't really know that.

01:31.274 --> 01:33.538
All you know is that
you and a lot of other people

01:33.609 --> 01:37.011
witnessed this guy beating up his kid.
That's child abuse.

01:37.081 --> 01:39.072
I know, I know, I know.

02:06.345 --> 02:08.245
It's not like
we have a choice.

02:12.284 --> 02:15.014
No, I don't think we do
have a choice.

02:18.258 --> 02:20.249
Do you want me to do it?

02:21.261 --> 02:23.024
No, I should do it.
I'll do it.

02:28.202 --> 02:30.102
I'll do it.

03:19.624 --> 03:20.818
This is it, folks,

03:20.892 --> 03:23.122
three days till
football Christmas.

03:23.195 --> 03:25.493
Yes, it's no secret
that many of us are worried

03:25.564 --> 03:28.294
that the Panthers are about to
get their stockings stuffed.

03:28.366 --> 03:31.996
Now, South Texas is the best high
school football team I have ever seen.

03:32.071 --> 03:35.404
Even the '81 Panthers would have
a tough time beating this squad.

03:35.474 --> 03:39.001
I'm just saying, Coach Taylor's gonna
need help from above to beat these boys.

04:02.804 --> 04:04.931
Oh! Sorry! Billy! Billy, get out!
I'm going to the bathroom!

04:05.006 --> 04:06.735
Hey, I've really gotta pee,
so how long are you gonna be?

04:06.808 --> 04:08.776
Okay, Billy, close the door, please.
I'm going to the bathroom!

04:08.843 --> 04:12.541
Fine!
I'll just piss in the sink!

04:12.615 --> 04:14.344
Tim, wake your ass up!

04:14.416 --> 04:15.474
Seriously, man.

04:15.551 --> 04:18.418
Hey, I got something
to show you. This is big.

04:18.487 --> 04:20.421
Billy, we have school!

04:20.488 --> 04:22.855
Well, you're gonna have to
skip school, Lyla!

04:22.926 --> 04:26.293
Tim, get your ass up.
This is your future.

04:30.233 --> 04:32.224
Stop!
Love it.

04:32.302 --> 04:34.429
No, seriously, check it out.

04:36.007 --> 04:38.339
What do you think? Huh?

04:39.110 --> 04:41.135
It's beautiful, right?
It's perfect, man.

04:41.212 --> 04:42.770
It was either this or Quiznos,

04:42.847 --> 04:44.678
but I couldn't pass this up.
No. No-brainer.

04:44.749 --> 04:46.478
Yeah, I'm gonna name it
Riggins' Rigs.

04:46.550 --> 04:48.542
It's gonna be awesome.
That's perfect, dude.

04:48.620 --> 04:51.350
Put a hydraulic lift there
where that car is. Yeah.

04:51.423 --> 04:54.256
A little refrigerator over in the
corner stocked full of beer...

04:54.326 --> 04:55.554
Well, it's a
must-have, a must-have.

04:55.627 --> 04:57.618
24I7, fixing cars,
drinking beer.

04:57.696 --> 04:59.789
I mean, what more do you need?

05:02.969 --> 05:04.163
It's awesome, man.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.329
Yeah.

05:06.406 --> 05:07.896
It's awesome.
Yeah.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.806
Hahn, you gotta give
our quarterback time to throw.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.573
That's gonna be key
in this game.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.846
Are you seeing that secondary?

05:16.583 --> 05:17.641
I do.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.215
Coach, you're not
worried about them?

05:21.622 --> 05:25.649
Can't afford to be worried.
Doctor's orders. Bad for the ticker.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.355
These fellas are big
and they're fast.

05:28.430 --> 05:30.762
We've never seen anyone
like them yet this year.

05:30.832 --> 05:32.766
But you know what?
That's the one thing.

05:32.834 --> 05:35.166
They've never faced us before,
either, gentlemen.

05:35.236 --> 05:37.636
Keep that in mind.
It's gonna be a good fight.

05:37.706 --> 05:39.971
It'll be a damned good fight.

05:41.777 --> 05:43.301
Look at that!

05:43.379 --> 05:46.348
I'm so impressed
with this portfolio!

05:46.415 --> 05:47.473
Thanks.

05:47.550 --> 05:48.574
Oh, my Lord.

05:48.651 --> 05:49.709
I don't know,
it's kind of crazy thinking

05:49.785 --> 05:51.377
I might actually
go to school in Chicago.

05:51.454 --> 05:53.923
I know, but I think
you could really do it.

05:53.990 --> 05:56.982
The portfolio's the most important
thing, and you've got great grades.

05:57.060 --> 06:00.587
I think your teachers can give
you great recommendations.

06:01.164 --> 06:03.724
I still gotta get in,
though, so...

06:04.868 --> 06:05.927
What do you think,
Jules?

06:06.003 --> 06:09.063
I think it seems like a
really bright possibility.

06:09.140 --> 06:10.573
And it's in a real city,

06:10.641 --> 06:14.441
and so you have coffee
houses and museums and...

06:15.747 --> 06:17.180
Culture.

06:17.248 --> 06:19.479
That's
right, that's for sure.

06:19.551 --> 06:20.848
More than here.

06:23.355 --> 06:24.481
Hey.

06:24.556 --> 06:25.716
Well?

06:26.859 --> 06:28.190
Well, what do you think?

06:28.260 --> 06:31.492
How do you feel the colleges are
going to respond to this essay?

06:31.564 --> 06:34.032
You hate it. No, you hate it.
Yeah, you hate it. No, no.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.068
No, I didn't say that
I hated this paper at all.

06:36.136 --> 06:38.604
I did not say that I hate...
Okay.

06:39.439 --> 06:42.237
Tyra, I really do
hate this paper.

06:42.308 --> 06:45.301
It's because there were a lot of...
There were a lot of...

06:46.414 --> 06:48.814
A lot of things that
weren't correct.

06:48.883 --> 06:50.441
Well, okay, like what?

06:50.518 --> 06:56.583
Would you explain to me why every paragraph
has a tieback into Applebee's...

06:56.658 --> 07:00.094
Because I use it
as a metaphor. It works.

07:00.195 --> 07:03.722
"Sometimes it gets busy, and you
just have to roll with the punches,

07:03.799 --> 07:05.289
"just like in life... ' '"

07:08.904 --> 07:12.739
It reads like a
five-page needlepoint pillow.

07:12.809 --> 07:14.674
And it... And it's painful.

07:14.744 --> 07:16.837
Okay, see, that's not fair.
It's due this weekend.

07:16.913 --> 07:19.882
Okay, well, you just have to dig
a little bit deeper, and fastly.

07:21.617 --> 07:22.778
I hate you.

07:22.853 --> 07:24.582
All right.

07:35.366 --> 07:36.560
Joe McCoy?

07:36.634 --> 07:37.658
Yeah.

07:37.735 --> 07:39.362
I'm Mark Enderland,
this is Jodie Russi.

07:39.437 --> 07:41.302
We're with
Child Protective Services.

07:41.372 --> 07:43.772
We'd like to speak with you
and your family.

07:46.044 --> 07:49.037
I want a lawyer present
for this questioning, okay?

07:49.114 --> 07:50.979
You can't divide us up like
this and play good cop-bad cop.

07:51.050 --> 07:52.540
Okay, Joe, Joe, calm down.

07:52.618 --> 07:54.643
Has your dad
ever hit you before?

07:55.554 --> 07:56.953
No.

07:57.156 --> 07:59.147
Are you afraid of your
father now?

07:59.225 --> 08:03.094
No. No, I'm not.
I just want this whole thing to be over.

08:03.363 --> 08:05.888
Has he ever
hit your mother?

08:06.600 --> 08:07.624
No!

08:11.738 --> 08:14.299
Are you guys gonna
take him away from me or something?

08:14.375 --> 08:17.003
Okay, no.
This is outrageous.

08:17.078 --> 08:18.272
What country do you
think we're living in?

08:18.346 --> 08:21.509
Mr. McCoy,
I need you to calm down.

08:21.582 --> 08:22.879
If you don't cooperate with us,

08:22.950 --> 08:25.646
we can take your boy out of your
custody pending our investigation.

08:25.721 --> 08:29.054
Oh, my God.
Joe, just shut up! Please!

08:36.664 --> 08:39.533
The coolest thing is, of all the
places to study art, I mean...

08:39.602 --> 08:42.571
Art Institute of Chicago, they got, like,
one of the biggest Van Gogh collections

08:42.639 --> 08:43.663
in the country.

08:43.740 --> 08:47.471
And the thing is, Mrs. Taylor seems to
think I can actually, like, get in there.

08:47.544 --> 08:50.104
Of course you can. Matt,
I told you, you're talented.

08:50.179 --> 08:52.080
I know.
But the only thing is, I just...

08:52.149 --> 08:54.413
I mean, even if I get in, I don't
know how I'm gonna pay for it.

08:54.485 --> 08:56.510
Well, I've got a little saved.

08:56.587 --> 08:59.181
And I can send you
some money each month,

08:59.256 --> 09:02.521
and, you know, people always
need haircuts.

09:02.726 --> 09:05.594
Where are you sending
money? Huh?

09:09.501 --> 09:12.595
Where are you thinking about
going, honey? What's that?

09:12.671 --> 09:17.132
There's this art school at the
Art Institute of Chicago.

09:17.209 --> 09:18.733
Mrs. Taylor, Coach's wife,

09:18.811 --> 09:22.178
she thinks I got a really good
chance of getting in there, maybe.

09:22.248 --> 09:23.647
Chicago?

09:24.650 --> 09:28.677
Chicago? That's...
That's way up in Illinois.

09:28.788 --> 09:31.349
That's too far, honey.
I mean...

09:32.326 --> 09:34.055
What would I do here
without you?

09:34.127 --> 09:35.560
I don't know.

09:35.629 --> 09:38.359
Well, Lorraine, you
know, I still could stay here,

09:38.432 --> 09:39.831
and I'd like to do that.

09:39.900 --> 09:44.998
I think I made it perfectly clear.
I'm not living with you.

09:45.073 --> 09:46.597
Grandma, it was just an idea.

09:46.674 --> 09:49.837
And, Matthew, what's this
nonsense about art school?

09:49.911 --> 09:52.744
Ain't that just gonna waste
a whole bunch of money?

09:52.814 --> 09:55.477
Yeah, I mean, it was
just an idea for a minute.

09:55.551 --> 09:58.918
Wasn't a good idea,
was it? Huh?

09:58.988 --> 10:01.183
Yeah, you're probably right.

10:01.490 --> 10:03.253
Come on, guys,
let's get in here!

10:03.325 --> 10:05.623
Now, coaches and I wanna
recognize someone out here today

10:05.694 --> 10:08.255
not just for what they do on the field,
but what they do off the field.

10:08.798 --> 10:11.460
Which is what we expect
from the players out here.

10:13.536 --> 10:14.628
Where's Lance?

10:15.438 --> 10:17.065
85! 85! Step in the middle.
Let's go.

10:21.045 --> 10:24.173
Lance has earned himself a spot
on special teams, gentlemen!

10:24.248 --> 10:25.374
Oh, yeah, baby!

10:26.884 --> 10:28.715
In the State?
Do us proud.

10:28.786 --> 10:30.720
Let's go, Coach.
You wanna bring them in? Let's go!

10:36.795 --> 10:38.319
So what do you think,
Coach Spivey?

10:38.397 --> 10:41.594
I think we need to spike their Gatorade.
Those kids are huge.

10:41.667 --> 10:45.194
Yeah, but we gotta shut down their
penetration, 'cause he is killing that line.

10:45.971 --> 10:47.337
Coach?

10:50.076 --> 10:53.170
Was that you that called
those people from CPS?

10:56.149 --> 10:57.810
Why don't y'all
give us a minute?

11:15.870 --> 11:17.303
Yes, it was.

11:19.340 --> 11:20.398
Why?

11:26.115 --> 11:28.515
Because it's the law,
that's why.

11:29.752 --> 11:32.619
Why would you call
the cops on my dad?

11:34.757 --> 11:36.315
Do you hate him? Huh?
You think I don't know that?

11:36.392 --> 11:37.724
Son, it's not a matter of that.

11:37.794 --> 11:40.228
You didn't have to do anything.
You... You wanted to!

11:40.297 --> 11:43.698
I'm sorry you think that.
That's not the case, though.

11:44.334 --> 11:45.665
Sorry?

11:46.937 --> 11:48.529
That doesn't help me.

11:50.274 --> 11:53.107
I play football for you,
Coach, that's it!

12:01.152 --> 12:02.676
So how are you?

12:03.155 --> 12:06.124
Oh, honey, I've been knocked
down millions of times before,

12:06.191 --> 12:07.522
I can get back up.

12:07.593 --> 12:10.619
When the going gets tough,
the tough keep going.

12:10.696 --> 12:14.029
But that's not... You know, I just
wanna tell you, Lyla, that...

12:15.567 --> 12:17.331
I owe you an apology.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.598
And the only reason
I did what I did

12:19.672 --> 12:21.697
was because I didn't want
to disappoint you.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.774
But I know it was stupid.

12:27.213 --> 12:28.681
Yes, it was.

12:30.484 --> 12:33.078
But, Lyla, I'd really...

12:33.154 --> 12:35.247
I want you to
move back in, honey.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.051
I really want that.

12:37.725 --> 12:38.714
Okay.

12:40.261 --> 12:42.253
Okay?
Yeah, okay.

12:42.330 --> 12:46.858
I mean, the Riggins house
is disgusting. So, sure.

12:46.935 --> 12:49.836
Oh, so the honeymoon's over.

12:49.905 --> 12:51.566
No, the honeymoon is not over.

12:51.673 --> 12:54.142
Tim and I are doing great,
actually.

12:55.478 --> 12:57.708
And, in fact, the reason
I'm not mad at you anymore

12:57.780 --> 13:00.271
is 'cause the whole college
thing actually worked out.

13:01.150 --> 13:02.208
Hmm.

13:02.718 --> 13:05.585
What do you mean? Well, I'm going
to San Antonio State with Tim.

13:05.655 --> 13:08.216
And we're probably gonna get
a place together.

13:09.693 --> 13:13.527
It's kind of like the whole Vanderbilt thing
not working out was like fate, you know?

13:14.998 --> 13:17.262
Well, okay.

13:18.635 --> 13:20.433
San Antonio State.

13:20.972 --> 13:21.961
Hmm.

13:25.243 --> 13:27.234
Tyra!
I'm in here!

13:27.312 --> 13:28.939
Hey, how's it going?

13:29.013 --> 13:31.573
So I'm going to be playing
in the State game.

13:31.649 --> 13:34.244
I'm not gonna be on the bench, I'm
actually gonna be on the field.

13:34.620 --> 13:38.112
So, listen, whatever crappy seats
that you have, throw them away,

13:38.190 --> 13:42.251
because I have some less crappy seats, and
you're gonna wanna be as close as possible

13:42.328 --> 13:43.522
whenever the magic happens.

13:43.596 --> 13:45.360
Landry, I can't go.

13:48.101 --> 13:51.764
I'm sorry, I know that's lame,
but I have to finish this.

13:55.609 --> 13:57.236
No, you're right.

14:13.028 --> 14:15.690
I know that I'm being selfish.
I know I should be happy for her.

14:15.764 --> 14:18.358
She's, you know,
pursuing her dream.

14:18.433 --> 14:20.958
But at the same time,
this is huge for me, and...

14:21.036 --> 14:23.504
You are being selfish, 'cause you're
really starting to bum me out.

14:23.573 --> 14:25.438
You're killing my buzz.
Dude, that's pathetic.

14:25.508 --> 14:29.569
No, look, if a tree falls in the forest
and there's no one there to hear it,

14:31.614 --> 14:34.139
does it actually make a sound?
What the hell are you talking about?

14:34.217 --> 14:35.241
Who cares?

14:35.318 --> 14:37.184
Would you smile?
Stop talking!

14:37.254 --> 14:41.452
Hey, you grab this drink. We're gonna celebrate, okay?
We're gonna take a shot.

14:41.525 --> 14:42.685
I don't really do well
with alcohol.

14:42.760 --> 14:43.818
To your hard work...
You're gonna do fine.

14:43.894 --> 14:44.952
To your hard work and to State.

14:45.029 --> 14:46.087
To State!

14:46.163 --> 14:48.495
Just take your time. Let's go.
Don't taste it until you sip.

14:53.872 --> 14:56.340
Panthers! Panthers!

15:19.900 --> 15:20.992
Joe.

15:22.569 --> 15:25.732
Listen, I hope for you and I to
find some time to get together,

15:27.107 --> 15:29.542
find a way to maybe help J.
D. through some of this.

15:29.610 --> 15:31.976
Trying to put out that fire
you started, Coach?

15:32.714 --> 15:34.739
Joe, I'm not talking about
any kind of blame

15:34.816 --> 15:36.579
and I'm sure you're not either.

15:36.651 --> 15:38.448
I'm just talking about
helping your son out.

15:38.519 --> 15:41.580
Well, I deeply appreciate your
concern, but I tell you what,

15:42.324 --> 15:44.588
I can handle J.D.
He's just fine.

15:50.399 --> 15:51.559
All right, Joe.

15:54.437 --> 15:56.905
All right, gentlemen,
sit back, enjoy the ride.

15:57.941 --> 15:58.999
Hey. Hey.

15:59.075 --> 16:00.133
Yeah?

16:00.410 --> 16:02.640
Have you seen Landry?
You know where Landry is?

16:02.712 --> 16:04.270
No, man.
I haven't seen him all day.

16:04.347 --> 16:06.009
You haven't?
No.

16:06.650 --> 16:07.878
What the hell?

16:11.155 --> 16:12.281
What?

16:15.926 --> 16:17.621
Hello?
Where the hell are you?

16:17.695 --> 16:19.357
Where are you at?

16:19.431 --> 16:21.456
I'm on the bus
on my way to Austin.

16:21.533 --> 16:23.728
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

16:23.802 --> 16:25.997
Well, you better start driving
'cause we already left.

16:26.071 --> 16:28.164
I gotta... I gotta...
Mindy!

16:29.341 --> 16:30.638
Mindy.

16:33.846 --> 16:34.870
Tyra!

16:34.947 --> 16:36.539
Stop yelling.

16:36.616 --> 16:38.743
Oh, yeah, totally gonna puke!

16:38.885 --> 16:40.443
Rough night?
Yeah.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.010
Excuse me, Tyra.
You gotta get all your stuff together.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.353
Aren't you supposed to be on a bus?
Actually, I missed the bus,

16:44.425 --> 16:46.256
and I need you to
take me to Austin.

16:46.326 --> 16:47.315
Well, I can't.

16:47.394 --> 16:50.227
Because I don't... I can't drive
because I'm pretty sure I'm still...

16:50.297 --> 16:52.197
I'm still, like, legally drunk.

16:52.266 --> 16:54.734
So will you please...
Okay, okay, you need to calm down for a second.

16:54.802 --> 16:56.998
Okay. Hey. So, deal?

16:57.072 --> 16:58.096
Deal is...
What?

16:58.173 --> 17:00.334
You help me with this,
and I will drive you.

17:00.408 --> 17:02.706
That's... That's fine.
I'll help you with whatever it is...

17:06.981 --> 17:09.540
Panther,
Panther, Panther Blue and gold

17:09.617 --> 17:10.880
What?

17:10.953 --> 17:12.682
Take the ball off the field
and then we score

17:12.755 --> 17:15.690
What? Hope is number one
Hit squad's the best

17:15.758 --> 17:18.693
What? Panther, Panther,
Panther Say, forget the rest

17:18.761 --> 17:20.661
I said hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

17:20.729 --> 17:22.219
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

17:22.298 --> 17:23.766
I feel all right

17:23.834 --> 17:24.960
I feel all right

17:25.035 --> 17:26.763
I said hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

17:26.837 --> 17:28.304
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

17:28.371 --> 17:29.668
I feel all right

17:29.739 --> 17:30.899
I feel all right

17:30.974 --> 17:32.805
I said
Panther, Panther, Panther

17:32.876 --> 17:34.070
I feel all right

17:39.750 --> 17:42.014
How you all feel
going into the game?

17:42.086 --> 17:44.418
I really do feel like we're
gonna get the W here.

17:44.489 --> 17:46.013
Yeah?
Yeah.

17:46.090 --> 17:47.523
You really think you guys...

17:47.592 --> 17:49.823
Marty Booker used to play
quarterback, now he's a receiver.

17:49.895 --> 17:52.489
Seneca Wallace, you know,
he's the backup on Seattle,

17:52.564 --> 17:55.829
but he plays receiver
when Hasselbeck's in there...

18:00.305 --> 18:04.367
Has Matthew ever said anything to
you about wanting to be an artist?

18:05.478 --> 18:07.241
Well, he's really good
at drawing,

18:07.313 --> 18:10.009
and it's something
that he really loves.

18:10.550 --> 18:12.040
I mean, you've seen his stuff,
haven't you?

18:12.118 --> 18:16.215
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I've seen it, all
that artwork, and it's good,

18:16.290 --> 18:18.155
but I never thought
he was serious.

18:18.225 --> 18:19.783
I mean,
he loves football, honey.

18:19.860 --> 18:22.556
Well, he does
love football, but...

18:23.397 --> 18:25.922
I just don't think it's
a career path he wants.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.492
He's really, really
good at art.

18:28.570 --> 18:32.700
Well, I always encourage him.
Everything he does, I encourage him.

18:33.375 --> 18:34.706
I know.

18:34.776 --> 18:36.209
He knows that, too.

18:36.278 --> 18:37.336
Mmm.

18:39.248 --> 18:42.911
I don't want to be the one to
hold him back from anything.

18:45.188 --> 18:47.383
I know. Me neither.

18:53.797 --> 18:56.527
No, I'm ready to take us
to win the State.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.591
I'm ready to win the
championship, so...

18:59.036 --> 19:00.594
But I'll see y'all later.

19:00.671 --> 19:02.298
Well, thank you so much for your time.
Thanks very much.

19:02.372 --> 19:05.137
Hey. Hey!

19:24.863 --> 19:26.160
I know...

19:26.432 --> 19:30.927
I know this is a difficult situation.
I understand that. It's not lost on me.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.604
This team's depending on you.

19:38.812 --> 19:42.578
That means there's a freedom.
That's not pressure.

19:46.254 --> 19:49.587
I want you to at least
acknowledge what I'm saying.

19:50.224 --> 19:51.282
Yes, sir.

19:51.359 --> 19:52.348
Hey.

19:53.261 --> 19:56.095
Just try to leave it
off the field.

20:08.577 --> 20:09.602
Katie!

20:09.679 --> 20:11.738
Hey, hey, I've been trying to
reach you.

20:11.814 --> 20:13.406
Oh, you know, I was just
heading off to my room.

20:13.483 --> 20:15.246
No, listen, I know,
I know, but...

20:15.318 --> 20:17.843
You know what? I know you must
be furious at me. I just...

20:17.920 --> 20:20.718
I've been thinking about you.
I just want to know how you're doing.

20:21.492 --> 20:24.655
Well...
Let's see.

20:24.728 --> 20:26.218
Two flunkies from the
State of Texas

20:26.297 --> 20:29.266
barge into my house and scare
the hell out of me and my boy.

20:29.333 --> 20:32.325
Joe and I have to take parenting
classes from some 23-year-old

20:32.403 --> 20:33.802
who doesn't even have kids.

20:33.871 --> 20:36.773
And for the next year, CPS can just
drop by whenever they feel like it.

20:36.841 --> 20:40.174
If they don't like what they
see, they can take J.D. away.

20:40.879 --> 20:44.440
Katie, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I... Really, I just...

20:44.849 --> 20:47.910
I just... I want you just
to know I had no choice.

20:47.987 --> 20:50.012
Mmm.
Okay? I had no choice.

20:50.089 --> 20:53.889
I would never do that to you, you
are my friend, and I'm so sorry.

20:54.694 --> 20:57.185
Well, you do
what you had to do.

20:57.263 --> 21:01.394
Now you'll forgive me if I want
nothing to do with you, right?

21:03.236 --> 21:04.362
Yes.

21:11.078 --> 21:13.274
Read back what we have so far.

21:14.048 --> 21:18.246
Okay. "Facing the challenges of
being the student body president

21:18.319 --> 21:23.052
"has helped me to develop skills
and an appreciation... ' '"

21:25.594 --> 21:27.255
When did you become so mean?

21:27.329 --> 21:30.298
You obviously don't believe
any of what you're saying.

21:30.366 --> 21:32.129
Fine, Landry, why don't you
tell me what to write?

21:32.201 --> 21:33.566
I don't...
This is your essay.

21:33.635 --> 21:34.761
Should I write about
my trashy family?

21:34.837 --> 21:36.805
About the fact that
my sister's a stripper,

21:36.872 --> 21:39.068
or my mom is a
high school dropout

21:39.142 --> 21:41.872
who drinks boxes of wine
like it's water?

21:42.545 --> 21:44.911
Or about the fact that I lost
my virginity when I was 13?

21:45.014 --> 21:47.949
Or the fact that my papa
wasn't around? How about that?

21:48.251 --> 21:51.847
Ooh! I know what I should write about!
The fact that up until two years ago,

21:51.922 --> 21:55.824
I had enough hate in my heart
to start a frikking car!

22:03.434 --> 22:04.834
What changed?

22:04.903 --> 22:07.565
What? What changed
from two years ago?

22:07.639 --> 22:12.008
Why did you stop having enough hate in
your heart to start a frikking car?

22:15.847 --> 22:18.112
Jason Street got paralyzed.

22:24.390 --> 22:25.914
I realized that...

22:27.860 --> 22:31.126
He was this great guy.
I mean, like, this hero.

22:31.865 --> 22:33.890
And it happened to him?

22:36.136 --> 22:38.502
And it made me realize that

22:40.073 --> 22:42.338
life isn't fair for anybody,

22:42.911 --> 22:44.435
not just me.

22:47.115 --> 22:48.412
Uh-huh, and what else?

22:49.651 --> 22:52.711
I don't know.
I became friends with Julie,

22:52.787 --> 22:55.621
and Mrs. Taylor started
to take some interest in me.

22:55.691 --> 22:57.921
I started doing my homework.

23:01.464 --> 23:02.863
You.

23:04.867 --> 23:06.562
I met you.

23:09.439 --> 23:13.205
I started to feel like I was on the
inside instead of the outside.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.683
Hey, what are you doing
next year?

23:25.823 --> 23:28.348
Guess I'm going to
San Antonio State.

23:28.759 --> 23:31.387
Okay. Does that mean...
Are you excited about that?

23:32.396 --> 23:34.194
Am I excited?

23:36.969 --> 23:39.164
I guess I'm kind of
focusing on tomorrow

23:39.238 --> 23:41.433
and don't really wanna look
that far ahead, you know?

23:41.507 --> 23:42.633
You know what I mean?

23:42.708 --> 23:44.005
Yeah.

23:47.347 --> 23:49.941
Hey, it's a Frisbee!

23:50.550 --> 23:52.381
You sure you wanna
touch that right now, Seven?

23:52.452 --> 23:53.612
That's probably covered
in dog piss.

23:53.686 --> 23:57.122
It's not covered in dog piss!
It's just a Frisbee.

24:03.664 --> 24:05.131
Last game, Seven!

24:06.800 --> 24:08.233
No regrets.

24:16.344 --> 24:18.471
What are you doing over there?
You running in place or something?

24:18.547 --> 24:19.571
Come on, now.

24:19.648 --> 24:21.377
I can't get comfortable.

24:21.449 --> 24:23.212
Well, I can't either.

24:33.129 --> 24:34.187
Come here.

24:34.263 --> 24:36.197
What are you doing?
Come with me outside. Come on.

24:37.234 --> 24:38.701
Put your shoes on.

24:45.309 --> 24:47.140
It didn't go off.

25:11.670 --> 25:14.366
I have no idea what's gonna
happen tomorrow, babe.

25:17.811 --> 25:20.245
Well, you're gonna win.

25:22.449 --> 25:24.542
Or you're gonna lose.

25:28.255 --> 25:31.656
Either way, the sun's gonna
come up the next morning.

25:39.166 --> 25:43.968
"Two years ago, I was
afraid of wanting anything.

25:44.039 --> 25:46.269
"I figured wanting
would lead to trying,

25:46.341 --> 25:48.901
"and trying would lead
to failure.

25:48.977 --> 25:51.377
"But now I find
I can't stop wanting.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.675
"I wanna fly somewhere
in first class.

25:54.751 --> 25:57.242
"I wanna travel to Europe
on a business trip.

25:57.320 --> 26:00.050
"I wanna get invited
to the White House.

26:00.123 --> 26:04.059
"I wanna learn about the world.
I wanna surprise myself.

26:04.127 --> 26:09.498
"I wanna be important.
I wanna be the best person I can be.

26:09.566 --> 26:12.933
"I wanna define myself instead
of having others define me."

26:13.871 --> 26:14.929
There it is!

26:15.005 --> 26:18.463
"I wanna win and have
people be happy for me.

26:18.976 --> 26:21.445
"I wanna lose and get over it.

26:21.646 --> 26:23.944
"I wanna not be afraid
of the unknown.

26:26.117 --> 26:29.143
"I wanna grow up to be
generous and big-hearted

26:30.255 --> 26:32.986
"the way that people
have been with me.

"I want an interesting
and surprising life.

"It's not that I think I'm
gonna get all these things,

26:46.807 --> 26:49.275
"I just want the possibility
of getting them.

26:51.011 --> 26:53.445
"College represents
possibility,

26:56.216 --> 26:58.708
"the possibility that things
are gonna change.

"I can't wait.' '"

27:14.103 --> 27:15.934
What'd you think?

27:25.482 --> 27:28.474
I thought it was unbelievable.

27:30.854 --> 27:32.446
Mmm. It's great.

27:37.428 --> 27:39.919
I think it's great, too.

28:27.682 --> 28:29.912
Let me just ask you
one question.

28:31.553 --> 28:32.918
Can you play like champions?

28:32.987 --> 28:34.750
Yes, sir!

28:34.823 --> 28:35.881
Let's go get them.

28:38.693 --> 28:41.458
It's the Texas 5A
State Championship.

28:41.530 --> 28:44.226
The Dillon Panthers
facing the South Texas Titans

28:44.300 --> 28:47.167
in what looks like a real
David and Goliath match-up.

28:47.236 --> 28:51.104
The Titans have scored early and often
on their way to an unbeaten season,

28:51.173 --> 28:54.143
and they're as big and as fast
as anyone has ever seen.

28:54.211 --> 28:55.439
Tails!

28:55.512 --> 28:56.877
We called tails.

28:56.947 --> 28:59.848
The Titans have won
the toss, elected to receive,

28:59.916 --> 29:01.645
and Coach Taylor hopes
his defense

29:01.718 --> 29:04.243
can hold the Titans
on this first possession.

29:05.857 --> 29:07.119
Titans on offense.

29:07.658 --> 29:10.786
Quarterback drops back
to pass. He throws deep.

29:12.129 --> 29:13.858
And true to form,

29:13.931 --> 29:17.230
six points on the board
in a hurry.

29:22.207 --> 29:23.265
Come on!

29:25.043 --> 29:27.534
All of the Panthers'
hopes are riding on the shoulders

29:27.613 --> 29:30.480
of the freshman phenom,
J.D. McCoy.

29:31.084 --> 29:32.108
Hut!

29:32.185 --> 29:33.880
He drops back...

29:33.953 --> 29:35.443
Pressure's on.

29:35.688 --> 29:37.588
Oh! And he
gets taken down hard!

29:37.657 --> 29:38.681
All right!

29:38.758 --> 29:39.782
Hut!

29:39.859 --> 29:41.918
McCoy drops back.
McCoy! McCoy!

29:41.995 --> 29:44.487
He looks for a
receiver downfield...

29:45.399 --> 29:49.165
Interception! It's picked up,
and he can walk that one in.

29:49.236 --> 29:50.999
Touchdown number 2!

29:51.071 --> 29:54.336
Damn it!
Come on, guys!

29:54.541 --> 29:56.372
Hey, it's just one play.
Shake it off.

29:56.443 --> 29:58.275
Seriously, just run your
routes, man, all right? Geez!

29:58.346 --> 29:59.904
You gotta look 'em up
before you throw the ball.

29:59.981 --> 30:02.245
I'm not getting no time
out there, Coach!

30:08.089 --> 30:09.078
Hut!

30:09.458 --> 30:11.221
J.D. drops back.

30:11.294 --> 30:12.852
He looks...

30:12.929 --> 30:14.624
He's running out of time.

30:15.131 --> 30:17.292
He just gets that one off.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.424
Ooh! And it's incomplete.

30:19.502 --> 30:20.491
Hut!

30:20.569 --> 30:22.162
Titans on the blitz.

30:23.540 --> 30:24.973
And he goes down again!

30:25.042 --> 30:26.373
Hut!

30:26.810 --> 30:30.177
McCoy back to pass...
He better get rid of it!

30:31.515 --> 30:35.475
And he's sacked for another loss,
as the Titans make J.D. pay

30:35.553 --> 30:37.453
for his inexperience.

30:37.522 --> 30:39.422
Come on, you guys!

30:39.624 --> 30:41.182
Give me the time to throw the ball!
Relax.

30:41.259 --> 30:43.489
Huddle up,
huddle up, right now!

30:43.561 --> 30:45.358
Huddle up!
Come on! J. D!

30:45.430 --> 30:48.093
J.D. come here! What?
What, Coach? What do you want?

30:48.167 --> 30:50.192
You settle down.
Don't you talk to me like that.

30:50.269 --> 30:51.327
Second of all, you settle down.

30:51.403 --> 30:52.495
We've got a lot of game
ahead of us.

30:52.571 --> 30:54.971
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me? Yeah.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.133
Look at me when you say that!
Do you understand me?

30:57.209 --> 30:58.972
Yes, sir!
Let's go.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.743
First half
is almost over,

31:01.815 --> 31:04.443
and Taylor would really love
to get something on the board

31:04.517 --> 31:06.917
and go into the locker room
on a positive note.

31:07.187 --> 31:08.176
Hut!

31:08.288 --> 31:09.949
McCoy drops back...

31:13.361 --> 31:15.488
He's got Riggins
in the end zone.

31:16.263 --> 31:21.098
He's thrown it, and it is intercepted!
The Titans have it!

31:21.168 --> 31:24.069
He has got a ton of room,
one man to beat,

31:24.138 --> 31:26.437
and he is off to the races!
Come on!

31:26.508 --> 31:29.671
That is the
second Titan touchdown

31:29.745 --> 31:31.736
off a Panther turnover.

31:39.288 --> 31:41.654
Aren't you proud?
You did good! You did good!

31:41.724 --> 31:44.557
Hey! You give me no
protection out there. None!

31:44.627 --> 31:46.390
God, guys! Come on!

31:49.298 --> 31:52.462
Defense! Defense!

32:10.455 --> 32:12.218
We need more.

32:12.791 --> 32:15.419
Offensive line, you look like
you're on roller skates.

32:15.493 --> 32:17.553
We have got to stay
in our splits!

32:17.630 --> 32:20.599
Everyone has got to
come off the ball!

32:20.666 --> 32:23.032
Backside, you have got to
pick up the stunts.

32:23.102 --> 32:25.969
Coach Spivey, we're gonna readjust.
Base defense, press coverage.

32:26.038 --> 32:29.941
We are not gonna allow any more
big plays tonight, gentlemen!

32:31.978 --> 32:34.276
What are you looking at?
You wanna be out there on that field so bad?

32:34.347 --> 32:36.212
Yes, sir.
Well, then, show me something!

32:40.153 --> 32:42.645
J.D. you're out.

32:43.658 --> 32:46.422
Matt, change up your pads,
you're in.

32:47.128 --> 32:48.117
No! No!

32:48.196 --> 32:52.530
There's a fight going on out there, gentlemen.
Why don't you get in it?

32:52.600 --> 32:54.898
Clear eyes, full hearts.
Can't lose!

33:07.282 --> 33:10.616
Only 24 minutes of
football left in this season

33:10.720 --> 33:12.984
as the Panthers take the field.

33:13.690 --> 33:17.626
Let's hope they've learned their lessons
from the mistakes of the first half.

33:29.707 --> 33:33.040
And the second half
is underway.

33:34.479 --> 33:36.140
Panthers have it at the five.

33:36.214 --> 33:37.977
He brings it out to the 10...

33:38.483 --> 33:39.643
To the 20...

33:39.718 --> 33:41.879
He's got some room to the 30!

33:41.953 --> 33:43.682
He's got a head of steam!

33:43.755 --> 33:45.279
Go on, baby!
Go, baby!

33:45.357 --> 33:47.019
To the 40...

33:47.093 --> 33:49.721
And Landry Clarke
makes an incredible block,

33:49.795 --> 33:51.558
and the Panthers have it
at the 40, the 30...

33:51.631 --> 33:52.825
Go! Go! Go!

33:52.899 --> 33:55.094
He could go all the way!

33:55.168 --> 33:56.999
Touchdown, Panthers!

34:03.744 --> 34:05.439
We started right,
gentlemen!

34:05.512 --> 34:06.536
Yeah, baby!

34:06.613 --> 34:11.641
In a huge reversal, Coach Taylor has
gone back to veteran QB Matt Saracen,

34:11.717 --> 34:14.552
trying to get his Panthers
back in this game.

34:14.621 --> 34:16.920
He dumps a screen pass
off to Riggins.

34:16.991 --> 34:19.357
Riggins has got some blockers
in front of him...

34:19.427 --> 34:22.089
He breaks one tackle,
he's into the end zone...

34:22.163 --> 34:25.656
Stiff-arm!
And touchdown, Panthers!

34:27.303 --> 34:29.703
And the Panthers have
come out firing

34:29.772 --> 34:33.264
by putting 14 unanswered
points on the board.

34:37.346 --> 34:38.405
Hut!

34:38.481 --> 34:40.949
Saracen with a
play-action pass.

34:41.016 --> 34:42.348
He looks.

34:42.418 --> 34:45.411
Oh, and he takes off...
And look at him go!

34:45.487 --> 34:47.581
He breaks a tackle.

34:47.657 --> 34:49.248
And another.

34:49.326 --> 34:51.295
Touchdown, Panthers!

34:51.362 --> 34:54.592
And Coach Taylor's new,
old offense

34:54.665 --> 34:57.725
has his team a touchdown
from the lead!

34:57.802 --> 35:00.999
We have to do the same thing,
all right? Same thing!

35:01.372 --> 35:02.669
Set, hut!

35:03.675 --> 35:06.041
Vice quarterback
back to pass.

35:06.111 --> 35:08.306
And intercepted
by the Panthers!

35:08.747 --> 35:12.342
With less than two minutes to
play, the Panthers have the ball

35:12.417 --> 35:14.578
on the Titan 30-yard line.

35:14.653 --> 35:17.851
A touchdown and a conversion
gives them the lead.

35:19.525 --> 35:20.685
4-0-8!

35:21.761 --> 35:22.853
Hut!

35:23.229 --> 35:26.027
Saracen takes the snap
and pitches off to Riggins.

35:26.099 --> 35:27.896
Riggins runs right...

35:27.967 --> 35:29.833
And he's looking to pass!

35:29.903 --> 35:31.700
And he throws deep...

35:35.109 --> 35:39.341
And he's got Matt Saracen
on the logo! Touchdown!

35:39.413 --> 35:41.278
Unbelievable, folks!

35:41.348 --> 35:44.045
The Panthers have
taken the lead

35:44.119 --> 35:47.577
with just over a minute
and a half to play!

35:47.656 --> 35:49.055
Here we go.
That's how you go.

35:49.124 --> 35:51.115
That's what I'm talking about.
That's how you go.

35:54.463 --> 35:58.490
The Panther fans are
celebrating like they have the game won,

35:58.567 --> 36:01.502
but as the Titans and
Coach Taylor well know,

36:01.570 --> 36:05.267
the game is not over
until the final whistle blows.

36:05.574 --> 36:07.600
Defense! Defense!

36:07.678 --> 36:09.543
Thirty-seven seconds
left in the game,

36:09.613 --> 36:12.582
and the Titans are
driving down the field.

36:12.649 --> 36:14.116
Davis back to pass,

36:14.184 --> 36:16.379
a quick slant, and he's got it!

36:16.453 --> 36:18.944
The Titans are into
Panther territory.

36:19.022 --> 36:20.786
Inside, play inside!

36:20.858 --> 36:25.591
All on the Panther 45 as the
Titans approach the line.

36:25.663 --> 36:27.358
Bring them inside!

36:27.999 --> 36:29.489
There's the snap.

36:29.567 --> 36:30.659
Go! Get on him! Go!

36:30.735 --> 36:32.032
He is gonna run...

36:32.103 --> 36:33.298
Stay in there!

36:33.372 --> 36:37.240
He picks up a block, and he has
sprung to the 40 and wrestled down

36:37.309 --> 36:40.767
at the Panther 36.
It's a hurry-up offense.

36:40.846 --> 36:42.279
The clock is ticking.

36:43.816 --> 36:46.718
White! White! You have got
to stay in there!

36:47.320 --> 36:49.311
Davis is back to pass...

36:49.389 --> 36:51.789
He's got a man...
Oh, and it is complete

36:51.858 --> 36:54.292
at the Panther 19-yard line!

36:54.361 --> 36:55.828
This is it, folks.

36:55.895 --> 37:00.833
Just six seconds left, and this
game comes down to one last play.

37:00.901 --> 37:03.267
The Titans are going
for the field goal.

37:03.337 --> 37:05.737
Bad news for the Panthers,
the Titans' kicker

37:05.806 --> 37:08.866
hasn't missed from
this range all year.

37:08.943 --> 37:12.710
This has been a valiant effort
by the Dillon Panthers.

39:14.478 --> 39:18.073
I wanted everyone's friends and family
to be in here to hear this, gentlemen.

39:19.317 --> 39:24.380
I have never been more proud
of a team than I am right now.

39:25.190 --> 39:28.819
I am in awe of each and
every one of you gentlemen.

39:35.301 --> 39:37.235
You played great
football tonight.

39:38.638 --> 39:44.771
This is the game that people are
gonna talk about for years to come.

39:48.649 --> 39:51.345
This is the game
you're gonna talk about.

39:54.988 --> 39:57.719
There's not a single person in this
room that's ever gonna be the same.

40:00.595 --> 40:02.563
You be proud of yourselves.

40:05.199 --> 40:06.689
'Cause, gentlemen,

40:08.136 --> 40:09.968
you are champions.

40:30.694 --> 40:32.025
It's okay.

41:18.412 --> 41:19.811
Is that everybody?

41:19.880 --> 41:21.507
No, Riggins hasn't
made it on yet.

41:23.851 --> 41:26.319
Want me to send
somebody out there?

41:27.322 --> 41:29.847
No, let's give him a minute.

41:29.924 --> 41:31.585
He'll be here.
