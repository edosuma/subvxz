WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:04.082
She's coming to!

00:06.134 --> 00:07.765
Let me go.

00:07.765 --> 00:10.117
Let me go!

00:10.117 --> 00:11.685
Kill you.

00:11.685 --> 00:12.304
We're not gonna hurt you.

00:12.304 --> 00:14.353
Liar!

00:14.353 --> 00:18.756
Get away from me! No!

00:20.715 --> 00:24.916
Song: "Faith of the Heart"
It's been a long road,

00:24.916 --> 00:28.390
Getting from there to here,

00:28.390 --> 00:32.185
It's been a long time,

00:32.185 --> 00:36.068
But my time is finally near,

00:36.068 --> 00:40.367
And I will see my dream come alive at last,

00:40.367 --> 00:43.950
I will touch the sky

00:43.950 --> 00:47.867
And they're not gonna hold me down no more,

00:47.867 --> 00:50.859
No they're not gonna change my mind,

00:50.859 --> 00:55.667
Cause I've got faith of the heart,

00:55.667 --> 00:58.500
I'm going where my heart will take me,

00:58.500 --> 01:03.580
I've got faith to believe,

01:03.580 --> 01:06.304
I can do anything,

01:06.304 --> 01:13.981
I've got strength of the soul,
But no one gonna bend or break me,

01:13.981 --> 01:19.882
I can reach, any star,

01:19.882 --> 01:23.608
I've got faith,

01:23.608 --> 01:31.123
I've got faith, faith of the heart.

01:38.770 --> 01:39.897
057 (3x05) Impulse

01:39.897 --> 01:41.598
The damage is more severe than I expected.

01:41.598 --> 01:44.740
- Can you reverse it?
- I'm not certain.

01:44.740 --> 01:45.611
What is he doing?

01:45.611 --> 01:46.765
It's all right. He's trying to help you.

01:46.765 --> 01:50.189
He's trying to kill me... like you killed the others!

01:50.189 --> 01:58.933
Murderers! Get away! No! No! No!

02:14.165 --> 02:18.613
one day earlier

02:23.167 --> 02:25.313
I talked with Chef at dinner.

02:25.313 --> 02:29.589
He's a little worried about the crew.

02:29.589 --> 02:31.632
People are skipping meals.

02:31.632 --> 02:35.416
He figures they're either too busy, or the stress
of this mission is starting to get to them.

02:35.416 --> 02:40.175
I haven't had much of an appetite myself.

02:40.175 --> 02:41.886
Movie night's been on hold since we entered the Expanse.

02:41.886 --> 02:45.556
Maybe we should start if up again.

02:45.556 --> 02:50.329
There'll be plenty of time for movies after we've dealt with the Xindi.

02:50.329 --> 02:53.077
No one hates the Xindi more than I do, Captain,

02:53.077 --> 02:56.496
but I'm telling you, this crew needs a little R&R.

02:56.496 --> 02:58.568
Unless you want Phlox to start medicating people, we gotta...

02:58.568 --> 03:02.725
we gotta find a way to boost morale.

03:02.725 --> 03:05.046
What did you have in mind?

03:05.046 --> 03:07.639
I was thinking about a comedy.

03:07.639 --> 03:11.859
One of the classic Hope and Crosby pictures.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.558
Good choice.

03:15.442 --> 03:16.803
Captain?

03:16.803 --> 03:20.176
We've been reviewing some of these Xindi starcharts.

03:20.176 --> 03:21.851
Trip thought they might be able to help us figure out

03:21.851 --> 03:24.358
if there are any more spatial anomalies in the region.

03:24.358 --> 03:25.930
I would've helped you do that.

03:25.930 --> 03:28.775
It's late. I didn't want to get you out of bed.

03:28.775 --> 03:34.023
Besides, our resident insomniac was looking for something to do.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.951
You have plans Tuesday night?

03:38.951 --> 03:41.293
Not at the moment.

03:41.293 --> 03:44.659
Mess hall, 1900 hours.

03:44.659 --> 03:45.893
Movie night?

03:45.893 --> 03:47.510
Back by popular demand.

03:47.510 --> 03:50.413
- Bridge to Captain Archer.
- Go ahead.

03:50.413 --> 03:54.980
I'm picking up an automated distress call, sir. It's Vulcan.

03:57.052 --> 04:00.212
- Have you tried hailing them?
- Several times.

04:00.212 --> 04:01.515
I'm on my way.

04:05.919 --> 04:07.065
Where are they?

04:07.065 --> 04:13.404
3.2 light years bearing 016 mark 12.

04:13.945 --> 04:16.572
I recognize the transponder frequency.

04:16.572 --> 04:18.089
It's the Seleya.

04:18.089 --> 04:20.682
They entered the Expanse nine months ago.

04:23.245 --> 04:26.958
Keep hailing them.
Set a course.

04:51.515 --> 04:54.395
The asteroids are moving in a chaotic fashion.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.613
Their paths are unpredictable.

04:56.613 --> 04:59.129
It may be the result of spatial anomalies.

04:59.129 --> 05:00.337
Where is the Vulcan ship?

05:00.337 --> 05:03.086
Approximately 2,000 kilometers dead ahead.

05:03.086 --> 05:05.437
I can guess why they were interested in this field--

05:05.437 --> 05:09.374
the asteroids are loaded with trellium ore.

05:10.627 --> 05:13.421
It looks a little too crowded in there for Enterprise.

05:13.421 --> 05:14.967
Wake up Mr. Reed.

05:14.967 --> 05:16.569
Tell him to meet us in the launch bay.

05:16.569 --> 05:18.226
Aye, sir.

05:18.226 --> 05:19.969
Try to get your hands on some of that ore.

05:19.969 --> 05:21.817
T'Pol.

05:33.413 --> 05:35.780
Starboard bow, 340 meters.

05:35.780 --> 05:37.122
I see it.

05:46.885 --> 05:50.568
No damage-- though we may need a fresh coat of paint.

05:50.568 --> 05:55.851
- How much farther?
- 1,200 kilometers.

05:55.851 --> 05:58.555
I could take the helm, if you'd like.

05:58.555 --> 06:01.946
Maybe on the way back.

06:02.586 --> 06:05.488
So what else do you know about the Seleya?

06:05.488 --> 06:06.867
A great deal.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.731
I served on it for over a year.

06:09.731 --> 06:12.967
It was my last assignment before joining the consulate on Earth.

06:12.967 --> 06:15.886
I was the deputy science officer under Captain Voris.

06:15.886 --> 06:18.735
Any idea what they were doing in the Expanse?

06:18.735 --> 06:21.135
They were attempting to chart the thermobaric perimeter.

06:21.135 --> 06:22.742
After several days, they reported

06:22.742 --> 06:26.524
that they'd become caught in some kind of subspace eddy

06:26.524 --> 06:28.998
and were being pulled into the Expanse.

06:28.998 --> 06:33.291
It was their final transmission.

06:33.291 --> 06:35.680
The Vankaara was sent to find them.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.009
You already know what happened to that crew.

06:38.759 --> 06:41.925
Let's hope the Seleya fared a little better.

06:42.647 --> 06:44.261
Directly ahead, 200 meters.

06:44.261 --> 06:45.983
Hang on.

07:03.154 --> 07:04.783
Good isotope density.

07:04.783 --> 07:07.678
We should get at least half a kilo out of this one.

07:09.959 --> 07:12.751
Let's try for something bigger this time.

07:16.716 --> 07:19.421
How 'bout, uh... this one.

07:20.473 --> 07:22.382
I've got a lock.

07:26.353 --> 07:28.006
Travis?

07:30.354 --> 07:31.979
There's an overload in the resequencer.

07:31.979 --> 07:35.077
- Shut it down.
- I can't.

07:50.257 --> 07:54.771
Ah! This thing's useless.
The coils are fused.

07:55.671 --> 07:59.442
What if I could put a shuttlepod down on one of the big ones?

07:59.442 --> 08:01.294
They're pretty unpredictable.

08:01.294 --> 08:02.641
You sure you could land safely?

08:02.641 --> 08:04.256
I can try.

08:07.670 --> 08:10.202
This'll be a new one for the maintenance crew.

08:23.455 --> 08:25.769
Main power's offline.

08:25.769 --> 08:28.175
Their hull's taken quite a beating.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.838
Life support?

08:30.838 --> 08:31.652
Minimal.

08:31.652 --> 08:33.994
Decks 12 and 13 have decompressed.

08:33.994 --> 08:37.688
I'm reading multiple bio-signs.

08:39.381 --> 08:41.794
This is Captain Archer of the starship Enterprise.

08:41.794 --> 08:51.389
Please respond.
Seleya, come in.

08:54.817 --> 08:58.220
The starboard docking port is still intact.

09:45.531 --> 09:47.779
Captain...

09:51.119 --> 09:54.797
They were lining this bulkhead with trellium.

09:54.797 --> 09:56.548
They didn't get very far.

09:56.548 --> 09:59.365
I'm reading bio-signs on this deck.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.831
I can't isolate them.

10:12.461 --> 10:14.038
Take starboard.

10:46.839 --> 10:49.297
Vulcan blood.

11:28.988 --> 11:31.652
One bio-sign.

12:28.438 --> 12:31.101
Are you all right?

12:32.379 --> 12:36.447
- T'Pol?
- I'm fine.

12:40.217 --> 12:43.599
His synaptic pathways have been severely damaged.

12:43.599 --> 12:45.656
Let's get him in the pod.

12:47.639 --> 12:51.919
Captain!

12:51.919 --> 12:54.591
Keep back!

13:02.938 --> 13:04.951
- Archer to Reed.
- Go ahead, sir.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.455
Have you come across anyone?

13:06.455 --> 13:07.771
Not yet.

13:07.771 --> 13:08.992
Watch yourself.

13:08.992 --> 13:12.294
Something's happened to them.
They've become violent.

13:12.294 --> 13:13.867
Aye, sir.

13:58.541 --> 14:01.326
Lieutenant, are you okay?

14:02.001 --> 14:04.385
What happened to them?

14:05.721 --> 14:06.953
Seven more.

14:06.953 --> 14:09.964
That direction-- 30 meters.

14:09.964 --> 14:11.586
Captain.

14:11.586 --> 14:13.675
Let's get out of here!

14:19.333 --> 14:20.368
What are you doing?

14:20.368 --> 14:22.395
Stun isn't working.
We should set our weapons to kill.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.639
These are Vulcan officers, and we're on a rescue mission.

14:24.639 --> 14:27.306
With respect, ma'am, they don't seem to want our help!

14:27.972 --> 14:29.891
You heard me!

14:30.488 --> 14:34.456
- Keep your weapons on stun.
- Yes, sir.

14:40.354 --> 14:42.783
Captain, over here.

14:49.620 --> 14:52.561
What are they doing?

14:58.265 --> 15:04.283
We're from the Starfleet ship Enterprise.

15:05.931 --> 15:08.807
Do you understand me?

15:17.631 --> 15:18.908
Is there another way to the airlock?

15:18.908 --> 15:20.421
No.

15:31.538 --> 15:34.226
- That way!
- Go!

15:46.509 --> 15:48.066
Go on.

16:09.095 --> 16:14.205
Archer to Enterprise.

16:14.205 --> 16:16.937
Enterprise, respond!

16:18.522 --> 16:20.619
If their com system's intact,
we may be able to contact

16:20.619 --> 16:22.039
Enterprise from the bridge.

16:22.039 --> 16:25.766
- Where is it?
- Seven decks above us.

16:25.766 --> 16:26.753
Seven?

16:26.753 --> 16:28.640
How many Vulcans are on board?

16:28.640 --> 16:32.653
Assuming the entire crew is still alive, 147.

16:33.644 --> 16:36.316
If I'm not mistaken, the launch bay's on this level.

16:36.316 --> 16:38.276
Maybe we can use one of their shuttles.

16:38.276 --> 16:41.624
The bay's depressurized, probably from an asteroid impact.

16:41.624 --> 16:44.027
Then we have to get back to our pod.

16:44.027 --> 16:45.125
That'll be difficult.

16:45.125 --> 16:48.450
All four bulkheads leading to the airlock have been sealed.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.377
We should keep moving.

16:51.377 --> 16:53.827
- How's your arm?
- It's fine, sir.

16:53.827 --> 16:55.479
He's losing a lot of blood, Captain.

16:55.479 --> 16:57.344
We've got to treat this wound.

16:57.344 --> 16:58.624
How far to their Sick Bay?

16:58.624 --> 17:02.111
- It's two decks up.
- Let's go!

17:04.239 --> 17:06.500
Are you all right?

17:06.500 --> 17:09.529
Since we've come aboard, I've been experiencing anxiety.

17:09.529 --> 17:13.406
Whatever's happened to this crew may be starting to affect me.

17:13.406 --> 17:16.540
We'll get you out of here as soon as we can.

17:24.567 --> 17:30.096
This one's more isolated, and I'm reading large deposits near the surface.

17:30.096 --> 17:32.450
Can you set us down?

17:32.450 --> 17:35.465
There isn't a flat spot much bigger than my quarters.

17:35.465 --> 17:38.677
Well, you're the pilot.
It's your call.

17:38.677 --> 17:40.356
Let's go.

17:41.724 --> 17:44.210
I'm matching the rotational velocity.

17:44.210 --> 17:45.881
Looking good.

17:45.881 --> 17:48.642
200 meters.

17:48.642 --> 17:50.697
You're drifting to the left.

17:50.697 --> 17:52.688
Got it.

18:01.771 --> 18:04.191
I hope you won't write that landing up in your log.

18:04.191 --> 18:05.194
Are you kidding?

18:05.194 --> 18:07.545
I'm gonna recommend they give you a medal.

18:10.979 --> 18:13.507
Let's try to make this quick.

18:41.742 --> 18:43.499
Any idea what's causing this?

18:43.499 --> 18:46.024
I'm not a doctor.

18:48.151 --> 18:50.665
But you are my Science Officer.

18:50.665 --> 18:53.532
I need to know I can depend on you.

18:53.532 --> 18:55.551
I'll do my best.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.270
His name is Solin.

18:59.270 --> 19:01.949
When I served here, he was the chief engineer.

19:01.949 --> 19:04.907
I knew him.

19:06.834 --> 19:11.422
Can you understand me?

19:11.422 --> 19:14.093
Sub-Commander T'Pol.

19:14.093 --> 19:18.432
We served together.

19:18.432 --> 19:20.856
Don't you recognize me?

19:25.690 --> 19:30.401
We're here to help you,
but we need to know what happened to your crew.

19:30.401 --> 19:34.120
Solin, look at me.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.950
Something has made you very ill.

19:36.950 --> 19:40.722
You've lost control.

19:40.722 --> 19:43.414
Tell me what happened.

19:43.414 --> 19:45.313
Tell me!

19:49.007 --> 19:50.764
This is going to happen to me.

19:50.764 --> 19:52.697
You don't know that.

19:52.697 --> 19:53.767
It's already started!

19:53.767 --> 19:55.711
I can feel my control slipping away.

19:55.711 --> 19:57.225
We're getting you off this ship.

19:57.225 --> 19:58.348
It's too late!

19:58.348 --> 20:00.775
We're going to take the scans you made back to Phlox

20:00.775 --> 20:02.784
and figure out what's going on here.

20:02.784 --> 20:07.159
But first, we have to get to the shuttle.

20:09.199 --> 20:15.066
How do you open those bulkheads?

20:15.066 --> 20:18.092
The bulkheads.

20:20.782 --> 20:24.762
There's an auxiliary control room on the engineering deck.

20:24.762 --> 20:26.555
Okay.

20:34.770 --> 20:36.217
Are you all right?

20:36.217 --> 20:38.246
T'Pol...

20:38.246 --> 20:41.256
We have to keep moving.

20:41.256 --> 20:44.285
I don't need your help.

20:56.612 --> 20:58.281
Two more bio-signs.

20:58.281 --> 21:00.366
50 meters beyond that hatch.

21:00.366 --> 21:02.304
It's the only way to the engineering deck!

21:02.304 --> 21:03.792
We'll go deal with them.

21:03.792 --> 21:06.687
- Stay with her, Hawkins.
- Aye, sir.

21:16.077 --> 21:17.481
Water?

21:18.277 --> 21:22.742
No offense, but you look like you could use some.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.580
Thank you.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.538
I apologize for the way I reacted before.

21:38.538 --> 21:42.287
You were right. This is a rescue mission.

21:42.287 --> 21:44.960
May I ask you a question?

21:44.960 --> 21:47.621
How is it possible that this crew could turn so violent

21:47.621 --> 21:50.876
when Vulcans aren't supposed to have emotions?

21:50.876 --> 21:54.572
A common misconception.
We have emotions.

21:54.572 --> 21:56.927
We simply keep them suppressed.

21:56.927 --> 21:59.368
Under control.

21:59.368 --> 22:03.235
Something has obviously caused them to lose that control.

22:03.235 --> 22:07.876
Why would they want to kill us?

22:07.876 --> 22:10.894
There was a time in the past when...

22:10.894 --> 22:14.891
we were an extremely violent race.

22:14.891 --> 22:18.445
We nearly destroyed ourselves.

22:18.445 --> 22:22.457
Paranoia and homicidal rage were common.

22:30.384 --> 22:33.002
Five meters.

23:08.404 --> 23:11.210
Any more where they came from?

23:11.210 --> 23:15.170
Not at the moment.

23:17.801 --> 23:20.728
- Archer to Hawkins.
- Go ahead, sir.

23:20.728 --> 23:21.841
We're all clear.

23:21.841 --> 23:24.929
Understood.
We're on our way.

23:24.929 --> 23:28.367
I heard about the accident you and T'Pol had in the lab.

23:28.367 --> 23:32.149
Oh, it was minor.

23:32.149 --> 23:34.287
Nothing to write home about.

23:34.287 --> 23:37.225
But you're sure this stuff is safe to bring on board?

23:37.225 --> 23:41.269
Don't worry, it only tends to blow up in its liquid state.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.243
- Enterprise to Commander Tucker.
- Go ahead.

23:50.243 --> 23:53.123
Sir, we've just picked up a spatial anomaly at your coordinates.

23:53.123 --> 23:54.082
We saw it.

23:54.082 --> 23:55.888
It's altered the course of the asteroid.

23:55.888 --> 23:58.578
You're heading into a denser part of the field.

24:06.567 --> 24:08.183
Grab a seat, Commander.

24:08.183 --> 24:09.525
Don't worry about me.

24:09.525 --> 24:11.272
Just get us the hell out of here.

24:21.485 --> 24:23.663
The starboard thruster's failing.

24:23.663 --> 24:26.022
There's debris in the intake manifold.

24:26.022 --> 24:28.128
Can you purge it?

24:38.482 --> 24:41.606
We're clear, but we've only got one thruster left.

24:41.606 --> 24:42.854
Can you get us home?

24:42.854 --> 24:44.457
I think so.

24:44.457 --> 24:47.388
- Shuttlepod Two to Enterprise.
- Go ahead, Commander.

24:47.388 --> 24:49.319
We're on our way back, but we've taken damage.

24:49.319 --> 24:51.680
Alert the launch bay crew to get ready for a rough docking.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.520
Understood.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.729
Secure the door.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.497
The transceiver's been damaged.

25:22.497 --> 25:24.791
Any chance of repairing it?

25:27.387 --> 25:30.814
- T'Pol?
- What?!

25:30.814 --> 25:34.813
Any chance of repairing it?

25:34.813 --> 25:37.875
There's an auxiliary transmitter.

25:37.875 --> 25:41.524
If I can get access to it, we may be able to contact Enterprise.

25:41.524 --> 25:44.704
Sir... I've encrypted the locking codes,

25:44.704 --> 25:48.691
but if they're determined to get in...

25:52.701 --> 25:55.316
Looks like the impulse assembly took a beating.

25:55.316 --> 25:57.519
Open up the engine housings and run a diagnostic.

25:57.519 --> 26:03.630
Bridge to Commander Tucker.

26:03.630 --> 26:06.964
- Tucker here.
- We're receiving a transmission from the captain.

26:06.964 --> 26:08.256
It sounds urgent.

26:08.256 --> 26:09.382
Route it down here.

26:09.382 --> 26:10.698
Go ahead, Captain.

26:10.698 --> 26:13.814
Trip, we're going to need some help getting off this ship.

26:13.814 --> 26:15.112
How fast can you be here?

26:15.112 --> 26:17.582
Pod Two took some damage in the asteroid field, sir.

26:17.582 --> 26:21.755
We're looking at... a couple hours before we can launch again.

26:21.755 --> 26:22.710
What's the problem?

26:22.710 --> 26:25.265
It's the Vulcan crew.

26:25.265 --> 26:27.324
Something's wrong with them.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.424
We're going to transmit some bio-data.

26:29.424 --> 26:32.262
Tell Phlox to start analyzing it.

26:32.262 --> 26:34.718
See if there's anything we can do to help these people.

26:34.718 --> 26:35.726
Acknowledged.

26:35.726 --> 26:36.962
Anything else?

26:36.962 --> 26:38.677
Just get that shuttle flying.

26:38.677 --> 26:41.082
- Aye, sir.
- Archer out.

26:41.082 --> 26:42.135
You heard the captain.

26:42.135 --> 26:44.254
Get a repair team down here.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.634
The bulkhead controls were severed on deck nine.

26:52.634 --> 26:55.470
I've rerouted them through the auxiliary grid.

26:55.470 --> 26:59.475
Mr. Reed, are you finished with those actuator circuits?

26:59.475 --> 27:02.982
They've all been realigned.

27:04.522 --> 27:05.732
Are you okay?

27:05.732 --> 27:07.742
What did you do?

27:07.742 --> 27:10.928
I-I realigned the circuits, just like you asked me.

27:14.068 --> 27:17.326
These aren't sequenced correctly.

27:17.326 --> 27:19.721
You overloaded the locking mechanism!

27:19.721 --> 27:23.350
Then we'll have to try something else.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.051
It's pointless.

27:25.051 --> 27:27.428
The circuits are damaged!

27:28.652 --> 27:34.212
I should've been watching him!

27:35.213 --> 27:42.064
But you didn't want me to see.

27:42.064 --> 27:45.245
Now I know what you were doing in the command center.

27:45.245 --> 27:46.493
What are you talking about?

27:46.493 --> 27:48.933
The Xindi starcharts.

27:48.933 --> 27:54.069
You were analyzing them behind my back, undermining my work.

27:54.069 --> 27:57.256
No one's trying to sabotage your work.

27:57.256 --> 28:01.696
We should all just focus on getting off this ship safely.

28:01.696 --> 28:04.776
There might be another way, sir.

28:04.776 --> 28:09.254
If we overload the power grid... it would disrupt the systems all over the ship,

28:09.254 --> 28:11.051
including the bulkhead mechanisms.

28:11.051 --> 28:12.946
The warp reactor is unstable as it is.

28:12.946 --> 28:16.729
Disrupting main power could shut down the antimatter containment.

28:16.729 --> 28:18.471
You'd cause a reactor breach.

28:18.471 --> 28:21.961
I don't think we have much of a choice.

28:27.229 --> 28:31.090
You want to kill all of us.

28:31.090 --> 28:33.636
You don't trust Vulcans.

28:33.636 --> 28:35.540
You never have.

28:35.540 --> 28:39.676
Sir, that pistol's set to kill.

28:39.676 --> 28:40.994
Give me the weapon.

28:40.994 --> 28:43.674
Don't think I've forgotten.

28:43.674 --> 28:49.513
You blamed us for holding you back, for undermining your father's work.

28:49.513 --> 28:53.261
Now you've decided to take revenge.

28:53.261 --> 28:54.966
I'll fire!

28:54.966 --> 28:56.142
Listen to me.

28:56.142 --> 28:58.894
This is a rescue mission.

28:58.894 --> 29:01.597
We're here to save these people.

29:01.597 --> 29:04.850
You're lying.
You want to kill them.

29:04.850 --> 29:12.100
If that's true... then why would I keep our weapons on "stun"?

29:12.100 --> 29:14.544
It' s not logical.

29:23.330 --> 29:24.956
It doesn't make sense.

29:24.956 --> 29:27.375
T'Pol and I have been working with trellium for weeks.

29:27.375 --> 29:29.249
She hasn't shown any symptoms.

29:29.249 --> 29:31.001
I don't imagine she would have.

29:31.001 --> 29:35.100
Despite your best efforts, you weren't able to synthesize it in any significant quantities.

29:35.100 --> 29:41.032
The crew of the Selaya, however, had the misfortune of
wandering into an asteroid field filled with the compound.

29:41.032 --> 29:44.675
Trellium-D is a potent neurotoxin to the Vulcan nervous system.

29:44.675 --> 29:48.519
It disrupts the synaptic pathways that allow them to control emotions.

29:48.519 --> 29:52.737
Unfortunately, the rate of decay is accelerating.

30:01.538 --> 30:02.575
Is it too late?

30:02.575 --> 30:07.203
I can treat her, but I need to begin synaptic regeneration as soon as possible.

30:07.203 --> 30:10.542
What about the Vulcan crew?

30:10.542 --> 30:12.453
Phlox, do you read me?

30:12.453 --> 30:14.303
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do for the others.

30:14.303 --> 30:15.988
They've been exposed for too long.

30:15.988 --> 30:17.991
The neurological damage is irreversible.

30:17.991 --> 30:20.432
- They're dying, Captain.
- He's lying!

30:20.432 --> 30:22.057
He wants them all to die!

30:22.057 --> 30:24.728
Doctor, there are over 140 people on this ship.

30:24.728 --> 30:27.751
I'm sorry, but they've been ex...

30:27.751 --> 30:31.923
Enterprise! Phlox, do you hear me? Respond!

30:31.923 --> 30:33.819
They've shut the com system down.

30:33.819 --> 30:37.820
Captain... they're flooding the compartment with hexafluorine.

30:47.112 --> 30:48.495
- Shut it off.
- I can't.

30:48.495 --> 30:50.121
They've bypassed the environmental controls.

30:50.121 --> 30:53.015
They won't let you destroy this ship.

30:53.015 --> 30:57.841
After you initiate the overload... ...how long do we have?

30:57.841 --> 31:00.875
15 minutes, maybe less.

31:00.875 --> 31:02.475
No!

31:02.475 --> 31:04.046
You heard what the doctor said.

31:04.046 --> 31:05.606
They can't be saved, but you can.

31:05.606 --> 31:07.202
Murderer!

31:07.202 --> 31:10.291
Help me get her out of here.

31:15.776 --> 31:17.734
- Malcolm...
- Just about there.

31:17.734 --> 31:21.460
Come on.
Climb!

31:27.715 --> 31:29.290
Malcolm...

32:28.415 --> 32:30.097
We don't have much time.

32:30.097 --> 32:35.138
No! No! No!

32:35.138 --> 32:39.529
You can't stay there.

32:50.495 --> 32:52.584
Another 20 meters.

32:57.666 --> 33:00.129
Captain!

33:09.620 --> 33:11.764
How are you at long-jumping?

33:17.902 --> 33:19.289
Watch her.

33:19.289 --> 33:22.616
Reed.

33:47.303 --> 33:49.708
Come on.

33:49.708 --> 33:50.730
You can make it.

33:50.730 --> 33:52.563
Get away from me!

33:52.563 --> 33:54.014
It's okay. I'll help you.

33:54.014 --> 33:56.832
You touch me and I'll kill you.

34:34.306 --> 34:35.639
Go!

34:44.440 --> 34:46.947
I said go!

35:00.004 --> 35:01.658
Give me a hand.

35:46.402 --> 35:47.565
What's wrong?

35:47.565 --> 35:50.514
I can't release the docking clamps.

35:50.514 --> 35:52.887
Full power to thrusters.

35:54.760 --> 35:56.671
We're being hailed.

35:59.739 --> 36:01.136
Are you all right, Captain?

36:01.136 --> 36:02.746
The docking clamps are jammed.

36:02.746 --> 36:03.809
We could use a hand.

36:03.809 --> 36:05.713
Stand by.

36:13.242 --> 36:14.480
You're clear, sir.

36:14.480 --> 36:17.703
The ship's about to blow.
Get the hell out of here.

36:31.862 --> 36:33.887
Archer to Shuttlepod Two.

36:33.887 --> 36:35.442
Are you still in one piece?

36:35.442 --> 36:36.447
We're fine, sir.

36:36.447 --> 36:39.107
See you back on Enterprise.

36:49.892 --> 36:51.991
We've got over 60 kilos.

36:51.991 --> 36:56.362
It should be enough to line the forward hull.

37:01.047 --> 37:05.209
May be awhile before Phlox finds a way to inoculate T'Pol.

37:07.055 --> 37:09.299
Take this to cargo bay one.

37:09.299 --> 37:11.146
Store it in a biohazard locker.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.655
Aye, sir.

37:16.007 --> 37:17.846
How'd it go?

37:17.846 --> 37:19.702
You got her out in time, Captain.

37:19.702 --> 37:22.055
Her synaptic pathways are mending nicely.

37:22.055 --> 37:26.907
But it will be a few days before she fully regains control of her emotions.

37:26.907 --> 37:31.191
I'd like to talk with her.

37:48.914 --> 37:50.875
Phlox was able to help you.

37:50.875 --> 37:53.537
You're going to be okay.

37:53.537 --> 37:58.000
The Seleya?

37:58.000 --> 37:59.675
It was destroyed.

37:59.675 --> 38:02.183
I'm sorry, but I didn't have a choice.

38:02.183 --> 38:03.647
They were beyond help.

38:03.647 --> 38:07.645
Their fate was sealed long before we arrived.

38:07.645 --> 38:10.895
Please don't be long.

38:17.491 --> 38:20.707
Was Commander Tucker successful?

38:20.707 --> 38:23.783
Yes and no.

38:23.783 --> 38:28.207
He collected a good supply of trellium.

38:28.207 --> 38:35.272
But it turns out it was trellium that poisoned the Vulcan crew... and you.

38:41.377 --> 38:46.532
It's essential you protect this ship.

38:46.532 --> 38:49.214
Leave me on the next habitable planet.

38:49.214 --> 38:53.356
I'm not going to do that.

38:53.356 --> 39:00.110
You can't allow your concern for a single crewman to affect your mission.

39:00.110 --> 39:04.490
This Expanse destroyed everyone aboard the Seleya.

39:04.490 --> 39:08.494
Don't let it happen to Enterprise.

39:08.494 --> 39:12.929
We'll find a way through this.

39:12.929 --> 39:15.835
But I won't leave anyone behind.

39:15.835 --> 39:18.226
Not if I can help it.

39:18.226 --> 39:25.926
I can't try to save humanity without holding on to what makes me human.

39:33.493 --> 39:39.347
Something tells me we haven't seen the last of the detective in the bow tie.

39:39.347 --> 39:41.229
He died in a house fire.

39:41.229 --> 39:43.319
Ah, did he, hmm?

39:43.319 --> 39:45.037
The autopsy was inconclusive.

39:45.037 --> 39:48.599
I wouldn't be surprised if the body belonged to the deliveryman, hmm?

39:48.599 --> 39:49.860
With the strange limp.

39:49.860 --> 39:52.664
We never did see him leave the house.

39:52.664 --> 39:54.836
What about the gardener?
He was there, too.

39:54.836 --> 39:56.438
Too tall.

39:56.438 --> 40:00.695
Even the primitive forensics of the mid-20th century would've determined that.

40:00.695 --> 40:05.487
Perhaps we should watch and find out.

40:06.300 --> 40:12.143
Part of the fun of a mystery is trying to solve it before it ends, using logic.

40:12.143 --> 40:14.831
And you, of all people, should appreciate that.

40:14.831 --> 40:18.897
Then use logic more quietly.

40:22.840 --> 40:26.372
All hands, report to stations.
Tactical alert!

41:11.160 --> 41:13.914
T'Pol... T'Pol!

41:13.914 --> 41:16.811
T'Pol!

41:16.811 --> 41:18.546
It's all right.
