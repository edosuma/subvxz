00:34.567 --> 00:37.001
-Yep.
-Yep.

00:37.670 --> 00:38.762
[helicopter whirring]

00:38.872 --> 00:39.839
[exclaims]

00:44.411 --> 00:45.400
Yep.

00:45.512 --> 00:48.538
That's your CH-47D Chinook helicopter.

00:48.748 --> 00:50.579
We're having war games this week.

00:50.683 --> 00:52.913
It's kind of like our team bus.

00:53.019 --> 00:55.385
Yeah? How's your team doing, Bill?

00:55.522 --> 00:57.752
They won't let me play.

00:57.857 --> 00:59.791
I'm just an Army barber.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.622
All I do is cut hair.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.390
I'm doing north of 85 heads a day.

01:04.497 --> 01:07.660
My wrist hurts so much,
I can barely open my beer.

01:08.168 --> 01:09.135
[exclaims]

01:10.804 --> 01:14.001
Oh, give yourself a break, Bill.
You do more than cut hair.

01:14.541 --> 01:17.772
You also straighten out magazines
and empty ashtrays.

01:20.313 --> 01:21.575
Don't listen to him.

01:21.681 --> 01:24.616
You're a very important cog
in the military machine.

01:24.717 --> 01:28.016
Imagine if our boys went into battle
with hair in their eyes.

01:28.121 --> 01:30.749
They'd be at a marked disadvantage,
I tell you what.

01:30.857 --> 01:34.293
Hey, hillbillies, look at my new SUV!

01:34.861 --> 01:36.522
This baby's so huge...

01:36.629 --> 01:40.326
if I crash into your puny pickup,
you get flat like pancake.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.400
[chuckles]

01:43.570 --> 01:44.537
[tires screeching]

01:44.871 --> 01:48.500
Where are you gonna keep it, smart guy?
It doesn't even fit in your garage.

01:49.342 --> 01:51.708
[cackling] Maybe I keep garage in SUV.

01:53.012 --> 01:53.979
Kiss my ass.

01:56.649 --> 01:59.914
Easy on the ice cream, Bobby.
It's sold by weight.

02:00.019 --> 02:01.680
I'm not getting any ice cream.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.416
All toppings. More bang for the buck.

02:06.092 --> 02:09.061
Care to guess the weight of your sundae?
Get it right, it's free.

02:09.162 --> 02:13.861
Okay. I have two scoops of ice cream,
low-fat, not that I need it...

02:14.667 --> 02:16.794
sliced bananas and gummy bears.

02:16.903 --> 02:20.168
That weighs exactly 8.3 ounces.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.333
Close. 4.5 ounces.

02:24.444 --> 02:26.309
Better luck next time.

02:26.946 --> 02:28.937
Eat this. I'm going again.

02:30.483 --> 02:31.507
[helicopter whirring]

02:31.618 --> 02:34.178
So, how are the war games
treating you, Corporal?

02:34.287 --> 02:37.313
I'm dead. Sniper tagged me with his laser.

02:37.423 --> 02:40.358
I think he caught the sun's reflection
off my grenade launcher.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.894
Yeah. Anything shiny is a sure giveaway.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.930
If I got to fight in the war games...

02:45.031 --> 02:48.228
I'd tar my head
just in case my helmet fell off.

02:48.434 --> 02:50.800
Hey, another good way to avoid snipers--

02:50.904 --> 02:54.431
Yeah, with all due respect,
we're talking about blowing things up...

02:54.541 --> 02:56.475
not blowing things dry.

02:56.776 --> 02:57.743
Oh.

02:57.877 --> 02:59.003
Sorry.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.179
[yells]

03:00.280 --> 03:01.542
My wrist.

03:01.648 --> 03:04.173
-Permission to stop clipping, sir.
-Denied.

03:04.450 --> 03:05.712
[patients groaning]

03:05.818 --> 03:08.719
Okay, Sergeant Dauterive,
it's carpal tunnel syndrome.

03:08.821 --> 03:10.789
You'll have to lay off cutting hair
for two weeks.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.154
But that's all the army lets me do.

03:13.259 --> 03:15.887
If you don't mind,
we need the bed for some soldiers.

03:15.995 --> 03:18.293
I mean real soldiers. I mean....

03:18.398 --> 03:19.865
You know what I mean.

03:19.966 --> 03:21.866
Give your chart to the nurse
on the way out.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.002
[groans]

03:31.211 --> 03:34.806
Any of you guys have large portions
of your medical chart blacked out?

03:34.914 --> 03:36.882
Just the stuff I did myself.

03:36.983 --> 03:41.283
On a scale of one to ten,
I'd say eight of my file was crossed out.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.351
Is that something to worry about?

03:43.456 --> 03:47.017
Only if the idea of a massive cover-up
concerns you. Jeez.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.958
Don't get him all jacked up about nothing.

03:50.063 --> 03:54.056
If the United States government did it,
I'm sure they had a good reason.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.965
Based on what I know
about Bill and cover-ups...

03:57.070 --> 03:59.800
I'd say the army used him
in their attempted assassination...

03:59.906 --> 04:02.340
of boxing promoter Bob Arum.

04:03.209 --> 04:06.042
-ls he right, Hank?
-Has he ever been right, Bill?

04:06.145 --> 04:07.635
You don't have to answer that.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.908
If you want to know
what was under that black marker...

04:10.016 --> 04:13.383
you need to get a hold
of your untransmogrified personnel file.

04:13.486 --> 04:14.646
How do I do that?

04:14.754 --> 04:18.747
Well, like any first-rate organization,
I'm sure the Army has a form...

04:18.858 --> 04:21.190
you can request, fill out and submit.

04:21.293 --> 04:23.489
Yeah. Good plan.

04:23.596 --> 04:27.054
Why don't you also ask them for a tour
of the underwater White House?

04:27.166 --> 04:31.034
You know, Dale, sometimes I think
you say things just to hear yourself talk.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.537
What do you want me to do,
ignore myself?

04:37.143 --> 04:38.872
Scoop full of Oreos.

04:39.145 --> 04:40.134
Two ounces.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.844
Half an ounce. Not even close.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.679
Bobby, you just focus
on smashing those cookies.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.310
I did not pull you out of school
to give me lip.

04:50.523 --> 04:51.956
Exterminator.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.212
Exterminator.

05:28.928 --> 05:32.261
Now we'll see who talks out loud
just to hear himself speak.

05:32.865 --> 05:33.832
[exclaims]

05:34.067 --> 05:35.466
I was right.

05:38.571 --> 05:40.596
All right, Dale.
Now that you've got us down here...

05:40.707 --> 05:43.369
where's this top-secret
fishing rod of yours?

05:43.576 --> 05:45.601
The fishing rod was just bait.

05:45.712 --> 05:47.509
What about the fresh-baked cookies?

05:47.613 --> 05:48.739
Almost done.

05:48.981 --> 05:53.350
Now, Hank, what progress have you made
on obtaining Bill's personnel file?

05:53.453 --> 05:55.478
I'll have you know I was right.

05:55.588 --> 05:59.285
The government does have a form
for exactly this type of request.

05:59.392 --> 06:03.021
Yeah. And they're gonna send us that form
in six to eight weeks.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.996
Well, how's six to eight seconds?

06:06.099 --> 06:07.066
[exclaims]

06:08.401 --> 06:12.599
Now, as you will see
from this incontrovertible evidence...

06:12.839 --> 06:15.205
Sergeant, then Private, Bill Dauterive
was given large doses...

06:16.409 --> 06:20.675
of an experimental drug
from 1982 to 1984.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.580
The Army was trying to create
an elite group of Arctic commandos...

06:25.451 --> 06:29.285
stationed in Alaska
and able to withstand frigid temperatures.

06:29.522 --> 06:33.219
They called it ""Operation lnfinite Walrus.""

06:33.893 --> 06:36.623
Their mission, to repel an invasion...

06:36.729 --> 06:40.096
if and when the Communists
came over the polar ice cap.

06:40.199 --> 06:44.033
The drug was designed to promote
accumulation of heat-retaining blubber...

06:44.137 --> 06:48.801
on the torso, foster the growth
of insulating body hair...

06:48.975 --> 06:53.139
and create the ability
to undertake long periods of hibernation.

06:53.379 --> 06:56.507
[stammering] Yeah.
But all those years they told me...

06:56.616 --> 06:59.915
they were giving me super vitamin shots.

07:00.019 --> 07:03.455
Side effects include headaches
and erectile dysfunction.

07:03.556 --> 07:08.050
I gave 20 years of my life to the Army,
and this is what they did to me.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.152
Bill, it was a different time.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.925
It was back when we didn't know
the Russians were incompetent.

07:13.232 --> 07:14.199
[whines]

07:14.734 --> 07:15.701
[grunts]

07:15.835 --> 07:17.894
[sobbing]

07:18.004 --> 07:18.993
[door opens]

07:19.105 --> 07:20.072
[oven timer rings]

07:20.173 --> 07:21.333
Cookies.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.100
Three, four, five....

07:26.813 --> 07:30.374
Mama, look what they did
to your baby boy.

07:30.650 --> 07:31.617
[exclaims]

07:43.129 --> 07:44.096
[Bill mumbling]

07:55.741 --> 07:57.402
Look out, world!

07:57.510 --> 08:01.606
Fat, drunk, hairy, Army guinea pig
coming through!

08:08.354 --> 08:09.981
[crickets chirping]

08:10.089 --> 08:12.819
I saw the Army documents
with my own eyes.

08:12.925 --> 08:14.722
It was all there in black and white.

08:14.827 --> 08:19.389
Is this what my tax dollars are going for?
To put hair on Bill's back?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.761
Poor Bill.

08:20.867 --> 08:24.098
I cannot even fathom what it's like
to have low self-esteem.

08:24.203 --> 08:26.296
And I can fathom just about anything.

08:26.405 --> 08:28.566
Hold on. Let me take a guess.

08:28.908 --> 08:32.707
Okay, magazine with toenail topping...

08:33.312 --> 08:35.871
15.5 ounces.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.075
Yes! It's all coming together, Hank.

08:38.317 --> 08:39.544
[rumbling]

08:39.652 --> 08:40.640
What the....

08:48.761 --> 08:51.628
The Army found out I looked at their files.

08:52.164 --> 08:55.531
I'll be in the safe room.
Don't let them take you alive, dear.

09:01.974 --> 09:05.273
All right. We need some tunes.

09:05.778 --> 09:06.745
[sighs]

09:08.381 --> 09:10.110
[exclaims]

09:10.416 --> 09:11.906
I got the head spins.

09:25.932 --> 09:29.732
This is Hank Hill, block captain.
I know it's the war games...

09:29.835 --> 09:34.135
and I don't want to second-guess
your tactics. But are you in distress?

09:35.741 --> 09:39.074
Good Lord, I think there's some kind
of dead animal in there.

09:39.645 --> 09:42.705
It's Bill. He's soused to the gills.

09:43.482 --> 09:47.816
It's only Bill?
I scalded off my fingerprints for nothing?

09:48.421 --> 09:49.388
[exclaims]

09:49.889 --> 09:52.323
Come on, Bill, wake up. You stole a tank.

09:53.225 --> 09:54.192
[mumbles]

09:54.360 --> 09:57.796
I tell you what, man.
You had better call up somebody, man.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.694
Someone will find out
about the dang old tank, man.

09:59.799 --> 10:02.734
No! We can't tell the Army
Bill stole a tank.

10:02.835 --> 10:06.430
They'll tell their superiors
at America Online and he'll be dead...

10:06.539 --> 10:08.939
as well as everybody on his buddy list.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.167
[exhales]
They won't do that.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.507
But they will throw him in the stockade
for the rest of his life.

10:13.613 --> 10:17.105
We've got to take the tank back ourselves.
It's Bill's only hope.

10:17.316 --> 10:20.376
-Plus, we'll get to ride in a tank.
-I get to drive!

10:20.486 --> 10:23.319
Hey, man! What're you talking about?
I'm gonna drive that tank, man.

10:23.422 --> 10:24.514
It's got 1200 horsepower, man!

10:24.624 --> 10:28.321
It's got too much muscle for your skinny
little old puny old arms of yours, man.

10:28.427 --> 10:30.122
Not so fast, Boomhauer.

10:30.229 --> 10:33.460
I've been driving bobtail trucks
at Strickland for two decades.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.864
[mockingly]
Oh, I am so impressed.

10:35.968 --> 10:39.836
Have you also downloaded the classified
instruction manual for this tank...

10:39.939 --> 10:42.134
from Vladimir Putin's web site...

10:42.241 --> 10:44.573
took a correspondence course in Russian...

10:44.677 --> 10:48.169
translated the manual,
memorized it, and eaten it?

10:48.848 --> 10:52.477
-Have you, Hank? Putin?
-All right, all right.

10:52.918 --> 10:55.409
Peggy, I'm going to return the tank.

10:56.022 --> 10:58.650
[exclaiming] I can't fall asleep
with all this excitement.

10:58.791 --> 11:01.658
What do you say we go
to the Mega Lo Mart for a couple of...

11:01.761 --> 11:03.854
-I'm there!
-...make-your-own sundaes?

11:04.497 --> 11:05.464
[moaning]

11:07.266 --> 11:09.530
All right. First.

11:09.635 --> 11:11.102
[speaking Russian]

11:11.203 --> 11:12.636
Then l....

11:12.738 --> 11:13.898
[speaking Russian]

11:16.542 --> 11:18.908
Straighten it out, Dale.
It feels like you're weaving.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.070
I think I know how to handle a tank.

11:23.149 --> 11:25.811
Now, where's the cigarette lighter?

11:26.352 --> 11:27.842
Hold it, boys! Hold--

11:27.953 --> 11:28.920
[exclaims]

11:32.058 --> 11:34.686
[shouts] My ride! It's so cherry!

11:34.927 --> 11:37.953
Damn it, Dale. I told you.
You just hit a curb.

11:47.139 --> 11:49.164
[car alarm wailing]

11:51.077 --> 11:52.044
[moans]

11:52.178 --> 11:54.646
Open the hatch!

11:57.349 --> 11:58.316
[vomiting]

12:00.252 --> 12:02.777
-Not in the sandbox.
-Relax, Hank.

12:02.888 --> 12:06.949
Studies show that your average sandbox
is only 30%% sand.

12:07.059 --> 12:10.153
The rest is a mélaige of urine, feces...

12:10.262 --> 12:12.730
animal feces and et cetera.

12:12.998 --> 12:15.990
Bill, I want you to stand downwind of me...

12:16.102 --> 12:19.629
and tell me what you hoped
to accomplish by stealing this tank.

12:19.739 --> 12:24.233
I don't know. I was at the base,
I was drunk, I couldn't find my car keys....

12:24.844 --> 12:28.211
And look at me!
Look at what they did to me!

12:28.314 --> 12:29.781
Did they take your clothes?

12:29.882 --> 12:32.316
No. But they took everything else.

12:32.818 --> 12:34.479
When I first enlisted...

12:34.754 --> 12:38.190
I had the body
of ai all-city offeisive liiemai,,,

12:38.290 --> 12:40.588
aid hair like Roger Daltrey,

12:40.693 --> 12:45.323
I sigied up for the armored divisioi
aid I waited to be a taik driver,

12:46.565 --> 12:50.296
Oh, yeah, I had the coifideice of a mai
with a washboard stomach,,,

12:50.402 --> 12:52.063
aid a smooth back,

12:52.471 --> 12:55.668
Aid thei they started giviig me
my super vitamii shots,

12:58.444 --> 12:59.741
Now look at me.

12:59.845 --> 13:03.337
I'm a big fat pant-load
throwing up in the sandbox.

13:03.816 --> 13:07.252
I know you're disappointed
with the way you turned out.

13:07.419 --> 13:08.579
We all are.

13:08.687 --> 13:11.247
But the good news is, it's not your fault.

13:11.390 --> 13:14.188
All those things that were great
about you back in high school...

13:14.293 --> 13:16.853
the confidence, the charm, the pep...

13:16.962 --> 13:18.589
they're still a part of you.

13:18.697 --> 13:22.155
They're just hidden inside
the government's bloated, lazy body.

13:22.268 --> 13:23.326
What?

13:23.435 --> 13:26.927
So it's not my fault
that I'm fat, bald and lazy?

13:27.039 --> 13:30.099
Or that your breath always stinks
like rotting garbage.

13:30.209 --> 13:31.801
My breath smells?

13:33.112 --> 13:36.843
It doesn't smell pleasant most of the time.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.007
Why didn't you guys ever say anything?

13:39.118 --> 13:42.144
Well, we didn't tell you because
it would have hurt your feelings.

13:42.254 --> 13:45.189
But now that we know
it's the government's fault...

13:45.291 --> 13:47.885
well, Bill, your breath stinks.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.620
Yeah, man.
I'll tell you something else, man.

13:49.728 --> 13:52.822
You talking about standing in the alley,
man, that old cooler ain't cold, man.

13:52.932 --> 13:55.196
Paint don't dry
and the sun don't shine, man.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.997
-You know what I'm saying?
-You think I'm boring, too?

13:58.103 --> 13:59.127
Yes!

13:59.238 --> 14:01.229
Yeah. But don't take it personally.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.967
-You see, it's--
-Not my fault!

14:03.075 --> 14:04.599
I'm not a loser.

14:04.710 --> 14:09.340
Deep down under all this
government ape fur, I'm a winner.

14:09.448 --> 14:11.382
Well, I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let the Army...

14:11.483 --> 14:13.212
Iock me away for the rest of my life.

14:13.319 --> 14:17.016
We are taking the tank back to the base
and I'm driving.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.555
-Hi. Would you like to guess the--
-Save your spiel for the rookies.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.025
10.1 ounces.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.596
-I'm so sorry. 10.3.
-What?

14:27.833 --> 14:29.425
Oh, Peggy, you idiot.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.765
The cup. Of course, the cup.

14:32.104 --> 14:33.332
Peggy, you genius.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.705
I always knew I'd be a great tank driver.

14:38.811 --> 14:41.837
Just like I always knew
I'd live close to Hank.

14:41.947 --> 14:43.915
[police siren wailing]

14:44.016 --> 14:45.881
Oh, God! It's the cops.

14:46.085 --> 14:49.020
I wonder how much trouble you get in
for stealing a tank.

14:49.121 --> 14:51.316
And taking three hostages. Help!

14:51.423 --> 14:52.913
No. This isn't over.

14:53.025 --> 14:56.324
Maybe I still have a silver tongue
underneath all the plaque.

14:56.428 --> 14:58.293
What's this tank doing out on the streets?

14:58.397 --> 15:00.922
We were told the war games
would be limited to the base.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.194
Are you questioning my authority?

15:03.302 --> 15:05.736
I am a sergeant
in the United States Army...

15:05.838 --> 15:08.807
and you are impeding a military operation.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.967
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing, Sergeant.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.737
You just seem a little out of uniform.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.712
Have you ever driven
an Abrams M1A2 tank?

15:15.814 --> 15:17.543
-No, sir.
-Do you have any idea...

15:17.650 --> 15:20.585
how hot it gets inside
that heavily armored fighting machine?

15:20.686 --> 15:22.881
-No, sir.
-I did not think so!

15:23.022 --> 15:25.650
Now, I suggest you get back inside
that black-and-white...

15:25.758 --> 15:28.818
and forget everything you've seen here.
Do I make myself clear?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.589
-Yes, sir!
-All right, move out!

15:30.696 --> 15:33.995
And you! I'm gonna need your name
and phone number.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.761
I'm also gonna need you
to keep Saturday night open...

15:36.869 --> 15:38.461
because I'm taking you dancing.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.037
Sir, yes, sir.

15:44.310 --> 15:48.644
Yeah, as soon as we drop this baby off,
my life enters chapter two.

15:48.747 --> 15:49.975
The good years.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.924
Dang it, fella, I'm proud of you.

16:01.026 --> 16:02.789
I'm proud of me, too.

16:03.395 --> 16:05.124
[missile whizzing]

16:08.000 --> 16:08.967
[exclaims]

16:09.101 --> 16:12.229
That's live artillery.
Bill, where the hell are we?

16:12.338 --> 16:15.068
By the looks of all these tanks
being blown up...

16:15.174 --> 16:18.143
I'd say we're on the target range
for the war games.

16:21.547 --> 16:25.916
(Dale) Gentlemen, the crap has literally
been scared out of me.

16:30.189 --> 16:31.178
[Dale screaming]

16:31.290 --> 16:34.191
Stop! We're in here.

16:34.293 --> 16:35.954
[exclaiming]

16:36.061 --> 16:39.656
Oh, God. They must think
we're a target tank. What do we do?

16:39.765 --> 16:43.030
Don't worry. My years of military training
will take over.

16:43.135 --> 16:47.231
Sir, how do you want your sideburns?
No, wait. That doesn't apply.

16:47.473 --> 16:49.566
-Give me a minute.
-Choosing life!

16:52.344 --> 16:55.177
Incoming! Coming back in.

16:55.748 --> 16:59.013
It's safer in here
in my armor-plated womb.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.946
Can I listen to your heartbeat, Hank?

17:03.222 --> 17:07.715
Bill, you spent 20 years on this base.
How do we get off this dang target range?

17:07.826 --> 17:09.656
What are you asking Bill for?

17:09.762 --> 17:13.789
The Army destroyed all his brain cells
with their deadly placebo drug.

17:13.898 --> 17:15.992
No wonder he's an ignoranus.

17:16.101 --> 17:20.401
-What did you say?
-lgnoranus! It means ""stupid,"" you moron!

17:20.506 --> 17:24.339
-Dale, you said ""placebo.""
-Yeah. I read it in Bill's file.

17:24.443 --> 17:27.708
That was the name of the drug
they gave him. ""Placebo.""

17:27.813 --> 17:29.838
I think it's made by Pfizer.

17:29.948 --> 17:31.575
Dale, you're the moron.

17:31.683 --> 17:35.312
A placebo's a fake drug.
They shot Bill full of sugar water.

17:35.421 --> 17:36.718
Sugar water?

17:36.822 --> 17:40.622
They didn't think I was even worthy
enough to be a guinea pig?

17:41.193 --> 17:44.651
Quit pouting, Bill. It means
the government never tested on you.

17:44.763 --> 17:47.561
That's good news for you
and the taxpayers.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.628
Uh-uh. It means everything is my fault.

17:50.736 --> 17:54.934
The fat, the fur, and all those other things
I didn't even know were wrong with me...

17:55.040 --> 17:56.803
until my friends told me.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.876
[weeping]

18:00.279 --> 18:01.712
They're getting close.

18:01.814 --> 18:05.250
I'll flash the high beams
so they know we're all in here.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.482
I might have popped the trunk.

18:15.727 --> 18:18.525
Hey, should those target tanks
be firing live ammo?

18:18.630 --> 18:21.793
It must be a drone.
They said to be ready for anything.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.334
-Let's see if we can hit it.
-Let's do it.

18:25.971 --> 18:27.165
[crashing]

18:27.272 --> 18:29.866
You idiot!
Now they're shooting right at us!

18:29.975 --> 18:31.840
All right. Just calm down.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.639
You guys go out the escape hatch...

18:33.745 --> 18:36.179
and I'll drive the tank away
to draw their fire.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.909
And leave you here to get blown up?
No way.

18:39.017 --> 18:40.382
Don't worry about me.

18:40.486 --> 18:43.114
I'll use my boxer shorts
to tie down the accelerator...

18:43.222 --> 18:44.712
and then I'll jump out, too.

18:44.823 --> 18:48.452
Now, move! Move! Do you hear me?

18:54.933 --> 18:57.902
Two scoops vanilla,
one half-palmful of jimmies...

18:58.003 --> 18:59.971
three medium-sized pecan bits...

19:00.072 --> 19:03.166
and one ltalian maraschino cherry,
no stem.

19:03.408 --> 19:06.070
Exactly 8.4 ounces.

19:06.745 --> 19:09.805
Wrong. Wait, you're right.

19:10.182 --> 19:13.618
-We have a winner.
-I'm sorry. We have a what?

19:13.752 --> 19:14.719
Winner.

19:14.820 --> 19:18.017
That's right, boy! Peggy Hill, winner.

19:18.190 --> 19:20.556
Come on, Bobby. There's free ice cream.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.093
Free at last, free at last!

19:25.330 --> 19:27.730
Let's go! Run for the woods!

19:27.833 --> 19:31.496
We'll be safe from the shells
under the branches and leaves.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.332
Great job, Bill!
Now, come on, get out of there.

19:39.111 --> 19:41.602
[singing "Freebird" by Lynyrd Skynyrd]

19:54.259 --> 19:57.319
Target bearing 408 and closing.

19:57.429 --> 19:58.760
Fire in the hole!

20:04.102 --> 20:06.798
-Bill!
-Bill, man!

20:09.741 --> 20:12.005
He's gone.

20:12.644 --> 20:14.339
Bill's dead.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.141
[sobbing] Dang old Bill, man.

20:16.248 --> 20:20.582
Bill was a good friend.
He gave his life to save ours.

20:20.852 --> 20:24.413
I can safely say I would not have done
the same for him.

20:24.623 --> 20:25.647
[sighs]

20:25.757 --> 20:29.056
The last thing I told him
was he had bad breath.

20:29.761 --> 20:32.594
I wish I would have told him
that he was a brave man...

20:32.698 --> 20:35.098
honest, sweet...

20:35.734 --> 20:39.067
[weeping] like a big old stuffed teddy bear.

20:42.207 --> 20:43.765
I'm gonna miss him.

20:45.544 --> 20:48.308
[all sobbing] Yeah, man, dang old Bill, man.

20:49.314 --> 20:51.077
[Bill sobbing]

20:53.685 --> 20:56.085
Bill? You're alive.

20:56.288 --> 20:58.119
You made it out in time.

20:58.223 --> 21:01.454
Somehow I got blowed out
by the explosion.

21:01.627 --> 21:03.219
That hurt.

21:03.328 --> 21:06.297
Hey, look, my carpal tunnel is gone.

21:06.398 --> 21:07.922
[exclaims] That is gross.

21:08.033 --> 21:10.058
I heard what you guys said, though.

21:10.168 --> 21:12.966
That I was brave and honest
and a good friend.

21:13.071 --> 21:15.835
Do you still think that
now that I'm not dead?

21:15.941 --> 21:18.432
-Yep.
-Yep.

21:20.345 --> 21:22.074
[exclaims]

21:26.518 --> 21:30.386
Sir, you have the honor
of being my first lefty haircut.

21:30.656 --> 21:31.588
How does it look?

21:31.690 --> 21:33.351
It's too short, uneven...

21:33.458 --> 21:35.619
and you totally obliterated
one of my sideburns.

21:35.727 --> 21:37.092
But, on the plus side...

21:37.195 --> 21:40.187
I must say your breath
is unusually minty and inoffensive.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.267
Sir, I'm brushing every day now, sir.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.699
Well, carry on, Sergeant.

21:48.607 --> 21:51.098
[whistling]

22:29.548 --> 22:30.515
[ovei timer riigs]
