01:47.000 --> 01:49.794
Once upon a time,
in the city of Belfast,

01:49.878 --> 01:52.755
there lived a boy named
Terry, with a "Y".

01:57.427 --> 02:00.012
And everything in Terry's
garden was rosy.

02:02.724 --> 02:03.808
Well, nearly everything.

02:03.892 --> 02:05.017
Fenian lovers!

02:05.102 --> 02:06.726
Fuck off back to England!

02:06.811 --> 02:08.144
Commie bastard!

02:08.229 --> 02:09.437
Go on, get him.

02:09.646 --> 02:12.315
My dad's not a communist,
he's a socialist!

02:12.483 --> 02:15.193
And then Terry was Terri with an "I".

02:17.822 --> 02:19.114
Is he gonna be blinded?

02:19.198 --> 02:23.201
He's going to be fine.
I'm afraid it will mean a glass eye.

02:23.286 --> 02:26.162
He's just gonna see
things differently.

03:32.811 --> 03:34.312
What a fucking nightmare!

03:34.396 --> 03:36.064
Mind you your language.

03:36.148 --> 03:38.358
And they call this a revolution?

03:39.568 --> 03:41.361
Meanwhile, there was
another day of rioting

03:41.445 --> 03:43.363
across the city,
with petrol bombs...

03:43.447 --> 03:46.449
Some people did call it a revolution.

03:46.533 --> 03:50.662
Some people called it "The Troubles",
an equally useless word.

03:52.665 --> 03:56.000
I'd been going out in this
town since I was 15.

03:56.085 --> 04:00.588
I saw Roy Orbison at the Ritz.
I saw the Rolling Stones at the Ulster Hall.

04:00.673 --> 04:06.301
I saw Dylan. I saw Hendrix. I saw the Who.
The Animals. I saw the Kinks.

04:12.058 --> 04:16.228
I saw everyone. Everyone
who came to Belfast, that is,

04:16.312 --> 04:18.105
and everyone did come.

04:21.024 --> 04:22.484
Until they stopped coming.

04:25.488 --> 04:26.822
Here.

04:28.783 --> 04:31.243
- I thought we said ten?
- Ten for the whole night.

04:31.327 --> 04:32.494
That's you finished.

04:33.246 --> 04:34.413
Why?

04:34.497 --> 04:36.832
Why? Look around you.

04:37.750 --> 04:39.793
Nobody wants to go out any more.

04:40.294 --> 04:41.461
She does.

05:05.736 --> 05:09.572
A proper record collection should
have a track for every moment,

05:10.782 --> 05:14.201
and this was the moment
for The Shangri-Las.

05:21.835 --> 05:23.918
Are you here on your own?

05:24.754 --> 05:27.005
I was out for a walk
and heard the music.

05:27.089 --> 05:29.257
Thought I'd come in and see
if it was as lively as it sounded.

05:33.554 --> 05:36.347
It wasn't always like this.

05:36.432 --> 05:39.976
There were nights you had to queue
here just to get on the guest list.

05:40.436 --> 05:45.106
I don't mean to be cheeky, but you don't
look like a man with that many friends.

05:45.191 --> 05:46.816
Hmm.

05:46.901 --> 05:51.112
You wanna know the truth of it?
I still have lots of friends.

05:54.825 --> 05:57.827
Lots ofanarchist friends,
and Marxist friends,

05:57.912 --> 06:02.581
and socialist friends, and pacifist friends,
and feminist friends and...

06:02.665 --> 06:04.208
friends who were fuck-all.

06:16.054 --> 06:18.889
And then the first shot was fired,

06:18.973 --> 06:21.266
the first bomb exploded,

06:21.351 --> 06:26.522
and suddenly I didn't have any more
Marxist or feminist or anarchist friends.

06:26.606 --> 06:30.317
I just had Catholic friends
and Protestant friends.

06:35.198 --> 06:38.700
And I don't consider myself either.
So...

06:39.577 --> 06:41.744
So now nobody likes you?

06:42.371 --> 06:46.374
So now I'm just a bit more choosy
about my friends.

06:49.253 --> 06:52.129
Anyway, you're one to talk.
Where's your gang?

06:52.714 --> 06:55.591
They don't like dancing
as much as I do.

06:57.928 --> 06:59.136
Have you a pen?

06:59.221 --> 07:02.640
I'm an English student.
It's compulsory.

07:07.604 --> 07:09.939
Stick your name at the top of that.

07:20.033 --> 07:21.741
Are you Martian?

07:22.410 --> 07:25.453
Stop it, it's Ruth. R-U-T-H.

07:25.955 --> 07:31.001
Well, R-U-T-H, congratulations.

07:32.461 --> 07:34.421
You're the first name
on my new guest list.

07:43.055 --> 07:44.931
D'you wanna come back
to my mum and dad's?

07:45.016 --> 07:47.601
No. D'you wanna go back
to my mum and dad's?

07:47.685 --> 07:48.810
No.

07:53.649 --> 07:57.527
They say when you marry,
you marry your partner's friends, too.

07:57.904 --> 08:01.030
Eric told Ruth she'd get
the arse end of that deal.

08:01.114 --> 08:04.325
She laughed.
I don't think he was joking.

08:04.409 --> 08:07.161
Eric and I had been
comrades since our teens.

08:07.245 --> 08:09.830
It was one of those special bonds.

08:09.915 --> 08:12.082
Part pharmaceutical,
part philosophical.

08:13.376 --> 08:15.377
See, what baffles me...

08:16.254 --> 08:20.132
Jamaica and Belfast have
got so much in common.

08:23.386 --> 08:26.221
Cops and soldiers

08:27.098 --> 08:30.351
giving people grief day in, day out.

08:30.435 --> 08:35.022
Armed gangs wandering the streets,
murdering people for fuck-all.

08:35.106 --> 08:39.610
Only they've got reggae,
and what have we got?

08:40.443 --> 08:41.736
Shite?

08:41.861 --> 08:43.321
Utter shite.

08:44.949 --> 08:48.993
We stood side by side against
the dark forces on our streets,

08:49.078 --> 08:51.663
especially the ones who
used to be our friends.

08:51.747 --> 08:53.289
Marty. Ned.

08:54.041 --> 08:55.959
- Forgotten about those.
- No kiddin'?

08:57.378 --> 09:00.129
Does it not get lonely being
the last man standing?

09:02.967 --> 09:06.970
Do your feet a favour, take 'em
out dancing like you used to.

09:10.307 --> 09:11.766
See you around.

09:13.310 --> 09:14.686
Fucking hope not.

09:17.898 --> 09:21.650
Ruth's friends, now, Dave and Marilyn?
Dead odd people.

09:21.776 --> 09:23.652
People you could talk to.

09:23.736 --> 09:27.739
Tell you another thing I hate,
that word "communities".

09:27.824 --> 09:30.575
Whenever anybody in Northern
Ireland says "community",

09:30.660 --> 09:32.285
what they're really saying is "side".

09:32.370 --> 09:34.871
- You're dead right, it's false
consciousness. - Whereas "collective"...

09:34.956 --> 09:37.749
People of all religions and none
working to a common end.

09:37.834 --> 09:40.419
Er, mind your feet there, Dave.

09:40.503 --> 09:41.670
Turk.

09:44.298 --> 09:46.883
Don't tell me.
It's Hank Williams' birthday?

09:47.468 --> 09:49.803
Roy Rogers'?
Desperate Dan's?

09:49.929 --> 09:51.388
Nice hat, Eric.

09:51.472 --> 09:53.598
Terri. Are these all your clothes?

09:53.766 --> 09:56.059
These are my clothes.
All those are my records.

09:56.144 --> 09:57.477
- Terri.
- Where do you want them?

09:57.562 --> 10:00.396
- Back room for now.
- All of them?

10:00.480 --> 10:01.689
Terri.

10:03.233 --> 10:06.277
Just came round to tell you I'm
clearing off to London for a while.

10:08.405 --> 10:11.782
Don't take it so hard.
You're still special.

10:13.618 --> 10:15.369
Got lifted the other night.

10:19.708 --> 10:23.169
Couple of our old anti-war
pals were there.

10:24.129 --> 10:25.671
That fucker Marty?

10:26.089 --> 10:28.132
No, the other crowd.

10:31.887 --> 10:35.973
Except, of course, they're all
a bit more pro-war these days.

10:39.477 --> 10:40.643
Fuck me!

10:41.312 --> 10:43.313
Told me I was lucky it wasn't a bullet.

10:43.981 --> 10:46.816
- For what? Dealing a bit of blow?
- It's not the drugs.

10:47.485 --> 10:49.402
It was me. It's you, Terri.

10:50.154 --> 10:51.821
They let on like they're rebels.

10:52.198 --> 10:55.533
But we show them up to be
just cops in balaclavas.

11:03.834 --> 11:06.086
They want us off the streets.

11:25.688 --> 11:28.023
You are everything to me.

11:30.401 --> 11:33.362
I'll settle for being the
most important.

11:35.532 --> 11:39.243
And who could argue with that?
It was so simple.

11:39.369 --> 11:43.413
Swap rings, get a mortgage,
normal life.

11:44.082 --> 11:47.584
I forgot, though,
where we were living

11:47.710 --> 11:50.295
and what was passing for normality.

12:04.393 --> 12:05.768
Just leave him.
Get in, will ya?

12:06.895 --> 12:09.063
Terri, you say you knew this fella?

12:09.106 --> 12:10.773
From the '60s.

12:10.899 --> 12:13.401
He was a prick back then
and he's a prick now.

12:13.485 --> 12:15.987
Only now he's a prick with a gun.

12:22.411 --> 12:25.580
D'you think maybe it's time
we got out of here?

12:26.498 --> 12:29.500
That's what they expect!
That's what they want!

12:54.775 --> 12:56.026
Terri?

12:56.444 --> 12:59.613
- Say that again.
- I wanna open a record shop.

12:59.655 --> 13:00.822
On Great Victoria Street?

13:06.454 --> 13:07.996
Bomb Alley?

13:13.127 --> 13:16.295
Aye, you'll have to use
a bit of imagination.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.632
So, wholefood shop down here,

13:19.716 --> 13:21.884
I'll have the People's Printing
Press on the top floor

13:21.968 --> 13:23.844
and your shop here in the middle.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.223
Fucking brilliant!

13:27.390 --> 13:29.725
Do you know how long it's been
since I had someone in here

13:29.809 --> 13:32.019
telling me he wanted
to open something?

13:34.147 --> 13:36.148
I don't suppose you've
any collateral?

13:36.316 --> 13:37.483
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.402
These people won the
Nobel Prize, Dave.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.989
One million pounds to promote
peace and love in Northern Ireland.

13:44.032 --> 13:48.035
I and I is bringing reggae
to the people of Belfast.

13:48.203 --> 13:49.370
Good luck.

13:56.418 --> 13:57.835
One love.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.037
Fucking hippies!

14:39.961 --> 14:42.754
It's thought that these 10
became targets for revenge

14:42.880 --> 14:45.257
following the shooting dead
of three Roman Catholics

14:45.383 --> 14:48.218
from the same area in
a bar on Saturday night.

14:48.303 --> 14:52.306
Following the murders, the mother of one
of the victims appealed for no retaliation,

14:52.390 --> 14:55.434
but despite that appeal,
retaliation was swift.

14:55.560 --> 14:58.603
Politicians across the divide have
expressed their condemnation of...

14:58.771 --> 15:00.731
- What's that?
- I got a job.

15:00.898 --> 15:04.568
...fears of further revenge attacks.
The murders are further evidence...

15:04.736 --> 15:06.611
- Truant officer?
- Don't say anything.

15:06.738 --> 15:09.323
...on either side are far from over.

15:09.407 --> 15:14.076
To date, more than 1,000 people
have been killed in The Troubles,

15:14.119 --> 15:18.080
many in circumstances that should
remind the terrorists' claims

15:18.165 --> 15:20.750
that they have no wish
to harm innocent people.

15:20.834 --> 15:22.084
The question of a...

15:29.760 --> 15:33.137
You haven't anything a
bit more substantial?

15:35.682 --> 15:36.766
You mean like a house?

15:37.267 --> 15:40.770
It was pretty straightforward.
The 40 quid swung it.

15:40.812 --> 15:45.107
But here, I might be home a bit late.
I've a wee problem to sort out first.

15:59.497 --> 16:02.791
- Hello?
- Marty? Terri Hooley.

16:35.073 --> 16:38.826
There were people in our town who
shot people because of their religion.

16:38.868 --> 16:42.496
There were people in our town that
shot people because of their politics,

16:42.580 --> 16:44.748
or because of something they'd said

16:44.833 --> 16:47.668
or something someone
said they'd said.

16:47.710 --> 16:51.046
There were people who shot people to
make sure their guns were working right.

16:51.381 --> 16:53.674
Why doesn't everybody sit down?

16:54.092 --> 16:58.387
Some of those people were sitting
in that bar when I walked in.

16:58.513 --> 17:01.598
And some more of them
had walked in behind me.

17:02.392 --> 17:05.102
You know the old saying about
the devil and the long spoon?

17:13.527 --> 17:18.030
Thought for a bunch of cunts like you
a few LPs ought to do the trick.

17:23.579 --> 17:25.538
Well, don't all dive in at once.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.642
Stick it out.

17:48.395 --> 17:51.314
Right, now, everybody happy?

17:51.939 --> 17:55.484
Okay. Now, can I ask you
something in return?

17:56.611 --> 17:59.404
See, when this shop opens,
there's to be no coming round

17:59.447 --> 18:02.741
looking a donation for the
Republican prisoners

18:03.242 --> 18:05.410
or the Loyal Orange Widows.

18:06.454 --> 18:10.749
Oh, and another thing,
there's to be no trying to kill me.

18:12.168 --> 18:13.460
Anybody.

18:17.757 --> 18:20.425
Now, what about one for the road?

18:32.479 --> 18:35.189
That was some performance there, son.

18:35.774 --> 18:37.608
- I try my best.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:39.152 --> 18:42.488
You see them ones there,
you don't need to worry about them.

18:42.614 --> 18:46.325
Even the crazies remember a time
before it was like this.

18:49.621 --> 18:53.958
It's the ones coming up behind
that you need to look out for.

18:54.834 --> 18:58.128
It'll take more than a few
LPs to buy them off.

18:59.130 --> 19:01.715
- You underestimate my record collection.
- Mmm?

19:04.469 --> 19:06.011
Yeah, right.

19:42.214 --> 19:44.173
Cheers!

19:48.679 --> 19:50.012
Are you actually open?

19:50.346 --> 19:51.430
Aye, we're open.

19:58.896 --> 20:00.689
- What's your name?
- Pugwash.

20:00.773 --> 20:02.441
Pugwash, get that down you.
Cheers.

20:21.085 --> 20:23.754
I was sure there were
people like us around.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.381
They'd just fallen down the cracks.

20:27.425 --> 20:29.508
But we had reggae on our side,

20:29.551 --> 20:33.512
and country, and folk,
and blues, and rockabilly

20:33.555 --> 20:37.850
and every kind of crazy, brave
and beautiful record on our shelves.

20:38.769 --> 20:42.396
It was only a matter of time
before we smoked 'em out.

20:54.743 --> 20:55.910
Great choice!

20:56.870 --> 20:59.205
Too Many Saviours On My Cross.

21:05.712 --> 21:07.254
It'd have been wasted
on him anyhow, Terri.

21:07.547 --> 21:09.089
You're probably right.

21:11.258 --> 21:12.759
That's right, missus.

21:12.885 --> 21:14.410
And if you've got any sense...

21:14.881 --> 21:18.204
I said if you've got any sense,
you'll boycott the place.

21:18.808 --> 21:21.101
Right.

21:23.479 --> 21:25.730
Don't let the name fool you.

21:25.773 --> 21:28.149
"Good Vibrations."

21:28.275 --> 21:31.152
Naked capitalism is what it is!

21:33.781 --> 21:35.490
Fuck's sake, Dad!

21:43.749 --> 21:45.959
Hey. Boys!

21:46.001 --> 21:47.168
Run!

22:28.208 --> 22:30.168
Just the one today, Terri.

22:30.335 --> 22:34.172
Ah, Pugwash, beehives
and teenage suicide.

22:34.298 --> 22:36.632
We obviously share the
same taste in women.

22:36.675 --> 22:38.176
Three pound.

22:40.387 --> 22:41.846
Have you Orgasm Addict?

22:43.891 --> 22:45.641
- I think you've got the wrong shop.
- Buzzcocks?

22:45.684 --> 22:46.851
- Definitely the wrong shop.
- Fuck Off?

22:46.977 --> 22:49.187
- What? - "If you don't
wanna fuck me, fuck off."

22:49.229 --> 22:50.563
The Electric Chairs.

22:58.363 --> 23:01.240
I thought this was supposed
to be a record shop.

23:05.370 --> 23:07.496
- I'll order them.
- Mmm-hmm.

23:08.873 --> 23:11.500
Now, here you go.
Hot off the press.

23:12.043 --> 23:14.169
Here, stick that up for us.

23:14.712 --> 23:16.880
A gig?
Who's putting this on?

23:16.923 --> 23:18.215
Us.

23:18.341 --> 23:21.676
And those records? Where
are you hearing all this stuff?

23:22.261 --> 23:24.221
- Peel.
- John Peel?

23:25.223 --> 23:28.016
Last time I heard,
he was playing Pink Floyd.

23:36.734 --> 23:38.527
Sorry, boys.

23:45.243 --> 23:49.286
If I'd known you were gonna drag me down
here, I'd never have printed that thing.

23:53.250 --> 23:56.043
You know they used The Pound
as a morgue on Bloody Friday?

23:56.378 --> 23:57.753
Fuck's sake, Dave.

23:58.547 --> 23:59.922
There'll be nobody there!

24:49.096 --> 24:51.306
We're The Outcasts.
Thank you very much!

24:59.148 --> 25:00.523
Cops!

25:01.025 --> 25:04.777
Ah, yes, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.

25:04.820 --> 25:07.154
The boys in battle green.

25:09.616 --> 25:11.033
We had a bit of history,
them and me.

25:11.326 --> 25:14.286
You see, if we find so much as two
cigarette papers in the same room,

25:14.329 --> 25:16.288
it will be an ex-record shop.

25:17.123 --> 25:21.376
Of course, they had some serious shit to be
dealing with out on the streets of Belfast.

25:21.502 --> 25:23.128
You'd have thought their hands
would have been full.

25:23.504 --> 25:26.048
Pinkie, that your own hair?
Let's see some ID, love.

25:27.342 --> 25:29.051
- What age are you?
- 18.

25:29.177 --> 25:30.344
Mmm-hmm, and what's your name?

25:30.386 --> 25:34.473
Excuse me, Officer. I'd like
to report a civil war outside.

25:34.682 --> 25:35.849
Step away!

25:36.059 --> 25:39.019
No, no, no, you take your time.

25:39.145 --> 25:42.356
The shootings, the bombings,
the intimidation,

25:42.398 --> 25:45.983
that can all wait while you smell her
breath to see if she's been drinking.

25:46.026 --> 25:47.693
Right, you three,
stay where you are.

25:47.819 --> 25:51.197
As for you, I've warned you
once already. Step away!

25:52.324 --> 25:53.991
Right, so...

25:55.410 --> 25:57.036
We hate the cops.

25:59.247 --> 26:01.040
We hate the cops.

26:13.428 --> 26:19.202
S-S R-U-C! S-S R-U-C!

26:19.648 --> 26:25.018
S-S R-U-C! S-S R-U-C!

26:25.329 --> 26:29.067
S-S R-U-C! S-S R-U-C!
S- S R-U-C!

29:18.900 --> 29:20.943
Rudi! Rudi!
Rudi! Rudi!

29:22.070 --> 29:23.612
You might be needing this.

29:32.205 --> 29:35.249
Boys, where have
you been all my life?

29:36.084 --> 29:37.126
Do we know you?

29:37.252 --> 29:40.212
Terri Hooley. I run a record shop,
and that Big Time song...

29:43.090 --> 29:45.091
I want that in my shop.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.718
- You can want all you like.
- Uh-huh.

29:46.802 --> 29:48.219
You mean you haven't recorded it?

29:48.429 --> 29:50.555
Recorded it, aye.

29:50.598 --> 29:52.932
Who's gonna come to
Belfast to sign us?

29:52.975 --> 29:54.601
Just the way it is.
We don't care.

29:55.269 --> 29:58.563
Fuck's sake!
Raise your expectations!

30:00.357 --> 30:01.691
I'll do it, I'll put it out.

30:01.942 --> 30:03.610
- You're pissed.
- So what?

30:03.694 --> 30:05.945
- I'll put that record out.
- How?

30:06.697 --> 30:08.573
I dunno. How hard can it be?

30:10.034 --> 30:11.367
Whatever you think, mate.

30:11.619 --> 30:15.788
I'll be in touch next week, fellas.
You're making a record!

30:17.124 --> 30:19.626
You can't just go charging
into something like that!

30:19.752 --> 30:21.460
Anyway, we're meant
to be a collective.

30:21.544 --> 30:23.629
We are.
You're printing the sleeves.

30:23.755 --> 30:25.547
Here, will you record us, too?

30:25.632 --> 30:26.965
I'm not that fucking pissed.

30:30.386 --> 30:33.555
You'll never believe
what I've just seen!

30:34.307 --> 30:38.560
These kids, they don't give a shit!

30:39.145 --> 30:40.812
You have to hear them!

30:41.147 --> 30:43.148
Now? What time is it?

30:43.274 --> 30:45.442
I don't know. 4:00.

30:47.111 --> 30:48.487
You have to hear them.

30:52.075 --> 30:54.660
Everybody has to hear them.

30:54.911 --> 30:56.119
Right.

30:58.831 --> 31:01.123
Have you still your shoes on?

31:12.094 --> 31:13.594
Everybody.

31:31.530 --> 31:33.614
I finally understood what
converted Peel

31:33.699 --> 31:36.367
from Pink Floyd and all
that prog rock shit.

31:37.119 --> 31:41.204
John Peel. Greatest
radio DJ of all time.

31:41.289 --> 31:43.373
He got what it was all about.

31:43.499 --> 31:46.960
The revolutionary power
of the 7" single.

31:47.044 --> 31:50.380
That's why all the big companies'll tell
you there's a secret to making 'em.

31:54.051 --> 31:55.385
Come on, it'll be brilliant.

31:55.469 --> 31:57.387
Aye, okay. Christ.

31:59.724 --> 32:01.224
Are you the owner?

32:02.393 --> 32:04.144
He just nipped out.

32:04.228 --> 32:05.895
I phoned earlier. Terri Hooley.

32:06.897 --> 32:08.481
So when can you fit us in?

32:08.566 --> 32:10.025
I don't know, we're pretty busy.

32:10.401 --> 32:12.235
Oh, you're joking me?

32:13.321 --> 32:15.238
We've a couple of flute bands
coming in next week

32:15.364 --> 32:17.407
and a jingle for
cheese-and-onion crisps.

32:18.743 --> 32:21.410
Is that what you had in mind
when you started up?

32:21.494 --> 32:23.662
Flute bands and crisp commercials?

32:23.747 --> 32:25.080
Times we live in.

32:25.206 --> 32:27.082
I have to put the dinner
on the table somehow.

32:34.257 --> 32:37.551
And what about your,
er, rock-and-roll soul?

32:43.350 --> 32:45.225
How do you feed that?

33:09.249 --> 33:11.959
I can give you an hour on Tuesday
after next. 10:00 okay?

33:12.294 --> 33:13.795
In the morning?

33:13.879 --> 33:16.881
Come on, we're music people.

33:17.800 --> 33:21.094
Zoot Sims, Dreams.
This brings back memories.

33:21.136 --> 33:25.473
Amazing, isn't it? Bit of cardboard
and some pressed plastic.

33:27.142 --> 33:28.976
All that magic, 14p.

33:29.061 --> 33:31.771
- 14p to buy?
- 14p to make yourself.

33:34.316 --> 33:36.234
That's recording.

33:38.444 --> 33:40.946
Wall-of-sound production values,

33:45.910 --> 33:48.453
top-of-the-range pressing facilities

33:51.582 --> 33:53.417
and the sleeves are taken care of.

34:00.508 --> 34:02.676
- 14p?
- And we sell 'em for 50p.

34:02.927 --> 34:04.678
How many were you
thinking of doing?

34:04.846 --> 34:06.096
3,000.

34:07.140 --> 34:08.181
Trust me.

34:12.311 --> 34:14.521
Up your hole, EMI.

34:14.688 --> 34:17.356
Oh, I thought you were sending it
to EMI and Polydor?

34:17.774 --> 34:19.817
I know, but up their hole anyway.

34:19.860 --> 34:23.195
We made it. We cracked the code.
We did it without them.

34:25.657 --> 34:26.824
Out of my way!

34:28.034 --> 34:29.702
Look at that!

34:30.203 --> 34:31.495
We'd made the records.

34:31.538 --> 34:35.206
Now all we had to do was convince
3,000 people to buy them.

34:36.001 --> 34:40.045
It was Northern Ireland.
Some resistance was to be expected.

34:41.172 --> 34:43.466
There was still a circuit of sorts.

34:43.550 --> 34:47.136
I know what you're thinking, but don't
be fooled by the collars and the sideburns.

34:48.013 --> 34:50.181
These guys had balls.

34:50.389 --> 34:53.184
This guy ended up in Thin Lizzy.

34:54.351 --> 34:55.393
This guy

34:55.812 --> 34:57.687
ended up in Wings.

34:58.731 --> 35:00.231
These guys...

35:20.252 --> 35:21.419
You're barred.

35:22.254 --> 35:24.547
You can't bar us! We've never
even been in here before.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.883
Well, for giving me lip,
you're definitely barred now.

35:26.926 --> 35:29.177
I know people.
I could have you shot.

35:29.261 --> 35:30.929
I know the same people you know.

35:31.055 --> 35:32.680
I could have you sent to bed
without your supper.

35:40.688 --> 35:42.397
You're laughing now,
but I swear to fuck

35:42.440 --> 35:45.025
sooner or later I'm gonna get you.

35:49.948 --> 35:51.782
Power to the people.

35:53.076 --> 35:54.952
Right, back to business.

36:06.798 --> 36:09.800
What, them squirrely-looking bastards
you see glue-sniffing in Cornmarket?

36:10.718 --> 36:12.803
Doesn't "punk" mean
"fruit", anyway?

36:12.929 --> 36:14.137
I don't want that kind
of carry-on here.

36:14.556 --> 36:17.139
And they all have their own place.
They've got that shite-hole, The Pound.

36:17.224 --> 36:20.268
One night a week.
They need a place to call their own.

36:32.656 --> 36:35.241
Better stage than The Pound, and all.

36:47.337 --> 36:49.171
How many does this place hold
on a good night?

36:49.506 --> 36:51.841
How the fuck would I remember?

36:51.967 --> 36:53.175
I can. About 200.

36:54.428 --> 36:57.012
Some of these kids are only wee.

36:57.179 --> 37:01.850
I'd say 250, once the word spreads.

37:05.187 --> 37:06.688
Three or four nights a week.

37:18.951 --> 37:21.036
D'you know what this place
is starting to remind me of?

37:21.162 --> 37:22.495
What?

37:22.538 --> 37:23.663
Itself.

37:37.469 --> 37:39.303
Pass us the salt there.

37:39.387 --> 37:40.512
Please.

37:41.056 --> 37:43.223
- Please.
- This is lovely.

37:43.516 --> 37:45.059
Oh, the potatoes are George's own.

37:45.185 --> 37:47.811
You should get him to take you
round the garden after dinner.

37:47.896 --> 37:51.231
So you're a shop owner and a
record-company boss now, are you?

37:51.316 --> 37:52.816
How's your work going?

37:52.901 --> 37:55.235
Break your heart,
some of those estates.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.029
There's kids in their teens
have already given up.

37:57.238 --> 38:00.741
This is the same man that used to
march round the town with me, shouting,

38:00.867 --> 38:04.244
"Property is theft!
Property is theft!"

38:04.329 --> 38:06.914
Catch yourself on, Dad.
It's not like you think.

38:07.040 --> 38:09.541
All I've promised these kids
is to get them heard.

38:09.584 --> 38:12.711
I've sent the record out to every
record company in London.

38:12.754 --> 38:13.920
And?

38:15.047 --> 38:16.547
And I'm still waiting on them
getting back to me.

38:16.590 --> 38:17.840
Of course you are.

38:18.217 --> 38:21.177
It's the most rotten
industry there is.

38:21.261 --> 38:24.533
Bribes, payola, cartels.

38:24.847 --> 38:28.587
Get involved in that, you'll either
end up a crook or you'll go broke.

38:28.622 --> 38:30.770
- I'll never be a crook. - It's the
parents need the talking-to, isn't it?

38:30.896 --> 38:33.189
Not the kids. The kids'll only
go as far as they're let.

38:33.273 --> 38:36.776
Actually, I'm taking a couple of groups
out on the road next month.

38:36.902 --> 38:39.028
- What?
- Just a few dates.

38:39.947 --> 38:42.365
It's just to let people see
what's going on here.

38:42.449 --> 38:44.951
Are you sure it's wise driving a
van round this country at night?

38:45.285 --> 38:46.869
Look at those poor fellas
that got murdered.

38:47.079 --> 38:51.089
Oh, don't talk to him.
He's an impresario.

38:51.523 --> 38:54.284
The Lew Grade of
Great Victoria Street.

38:55.128 --> 38:57.963
How many elections is
it you've lost, anyway?

38:58.047 --> 38:59.214
Ten?

39:00.299 --> 39:03.760
Did it ever occur to you there might
be more than one alternative?

39:05.888 --> 39:07.431
More gravy, anyone?

39:11.811 --> 39:13.937
Watch your step, lads.

39:13.980 --> 39:15.313
Are these the Rudi roadies?

39:15.398 --> 39:18.400
- Ha-fucking-ha.
- Meet your new label-mates.

39:18.818 --> 39:20.610
You've changed your tune.

39:20.653 --> 39:22.946
Well, I'll have grown old
waiting on them changing theirs.

39:22.989 --> 39:24.823
Anyone else coming on this tour?

39:24.907 --> 39:26.158
- Tearjerkers.
- Can we come?

39:26.242 --> 39:27.993
- These two.
- Let's go.

39:29.495 --> 39:31.580
- Uncle Terri!
- Yeah!

39:31.664 --> 39:33.164
Cheeky bastards.

39:34.332 --> 39:37.334
Wait. Does anybody know
how to drive this fucking thing?

39:37.836 --> 39:40.796
We're your fucking stars.
You can't ask us to drive.

39:40.922 --> 39:42.256
Yeah!

40:32.681 --> 40:34.349
Where the fuck are we?

40:34.642 --> 40:37.393
We're on the road to Damascus.

40:40.689 --> 40:43.316
Hello, Damascus, we're Rudi.

42:47.730 --> 42:50.648
People keep handing me
these fucking things.

42:50.732 --> 42:53.067
They wouldn't be doing that if they
knew what happened to Big Time.

42:53.151 --> 42:54.401
Or what didn't happen.

42:54.486 --> 42:58.614
Hasn't happened yet. I'm still
waiting on calls from London.

42:58.698 --> 43:00.199
Maybe when we get back.
Wait till you see.

43:01.534 --> 43:03.118
I don't know where half
of them came from.

43:03.620 --> 43:05.204
- Everybody out of the fucking van!
- Ah, Jesus.

43:05.288 --> 43:07.247
- Out, out, out!
- Everybody out!

43:07.415 --> 43:09.333
- I said fucking out!
- Put your hands up!

43:09.626 --> 43:11.210
Whoa!

43:11.294 --> 43:12.670
- Put your hands up!
- Whoa.

43:12.754 --> 43:14.171
Search 'em, lads.

43:14.381 --> 43:15.839
What the fuck have we here, eh?

43:16.341 --> 43:18.384
A fucking scarecrow convention?

43:18.468 --> 43:20.970
Listen, fellas, we've just
been playing a few dates.

43:21.054 --> 43:23.555
- We're on our way back home
to Belfast. - Oh, yeah?

43:23.640 --> 43:25.724
And where are you
all from in Belfast?

43:25.809 --> 43:26.892
- East.
- West.

43:26.977 --> 43:28.268
- East.
- South.

43:28.353 --> 43:29.477
- South.
- North.

43:29.603 --> 43:32.939
Hey, are you taking the mick, Mick?

43:35.442 --> 43:39.529
You're telling me some of these fuckers are
Protestant and some of them are Catholic?

43:40.197 --> 43:41.739
Never occurred to me to ask.

43:44.451 --> 43:46.452
You ever think of setting
up a political party?

43:48.831 --> 43:51.290
You don't wanna know what
I think of political parties.

43:51.750 --> 43:53.376
You don't wanna know
what we do, either.

43:55.796 --> 43:58.715
All right, let 'em back on their bus.

43:59.299 --> 44:01.467
Right, boys, back on board.

44:06.348 --> 44:07.432
Jesus.

44:07.808 --> 44:09.725
We're getting reports on the radio.

44:09.809 --> 44:11.935
You might wanna watch yourselves
going west into Belfast.

44:12.020 --> 44:15.105
And north. Bit of trouble
in the east as well.

44:15.189 --> 44:16.648
What about the south?

44:16.733 --> 44:19.317
You should be okay
if you get going now.

45:18.502 --> 45:20.669
Any calls while I was away?

45:20.921 --> 45:22.254
Nothing.

45:23.840 --> 45:26.592
What's it take to get noticed
by these wankers?

45:35.309 --> 45:37.143
Don't fucking start.

45:56.622 --> 45:57.705
Well?

45:59.250 --> 46:03.878
"Dear Mr Hooley,
go fuck yourself." Again.

46:06.673 --> 46:09.383
I thought making the record
was supposed to be the hard part.

46:09.467 --> 46:12.136
- Ah, that's Belfast.
- No. It's London.

46:12.679 --> 46:14.096
May as well be the moon.

46:14.222 --> 46:17.933
Look, Terri, you've still got the shop.
Maybe it's time to let this go.

46:18.643 --> 46:19.893
Yeah, maybe.

46:27.443 --> 46:29.945
- Youse looking for something?
- Aye, you.

46:30.029 --> 46:32.364
- Billy here sent you a tape ages ago.
- The Undertones.

46:32.448 --> 46:35.075
- And we haven't heard a thing.
- I've a shop to run. I'm a busy man.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.410
Have you listened to it yet?

46:37.579 --> 46:40.873
Great. We trek all the way down here from
Derry and you haven't even listened to it?

46:40.957 --> 46:43.083
I didn't say that.
Jesus, you Derry ones.

46:43.251 --> 46:45.043
So did you like it?

46:46.044 --> 46:47.920
- It wasn't bad.
- Wasn't bad?

46:48.005 --> 46:49.922
Now, there's no way that
you listened to it, then,

46:50.007 --> 46:51.382
because every song
on that tape's a hit.

46:51.466 --> 46:54.760
It's too early in the morning for this shit.
Where's my fags?

46:54.845 --> 46:55.970
Have youse any fags?

46:58.682 --> 47:00.308
Call yourselves punks?

47:00.392 --> 47:02.143
- Have you any fags?
- I smoked 'em all on the bus.

47:03.562 --> 47:05.855
Steer the ship while I'm away, Pugwash.

47:07.649 --> 47:09.150
I still think you're bluffing.

47:09.234 --> 47:10.359
Bluffing?

47:10.986 --> 47:12.737
Does your ma still dress you?

47:13.822 --> 47:15.573
Look, the thing is...
What d'you say your name was?

47:15.657 --> 47:17.325
Feargal. Feargal Sharkey.

47:17.409 --> 47:20.369
Feargal, the thing is, Good Vibrations
isn't really a proper label.

47:20.495 --> 47:22.580
If we don't get a record out soon,
it'll be too late.

47:22.831 --> 47:24.582
We're breaking up.

47:26.167 --> 47:27.751
Oh, now don't lay that on me.

47:27.835 --> 47:30.587
Look, all I wanted was to
open a record shop.

47:30.671 --> 47:31.755
Yeah, but you put out Rudi.

47:31.839 --> 47:33.840
- I know, but that was...
- And The Outcasts.

47:53.653 --> 47:56.112
Stop, stop, stop...

47:56.405 --> 47:59.491
All I'm getting in here
is echo, echo, echo.

48:02.286 --> 48:03.453
Hard going?

48:03.746 --> 48:06.705
Never been in a proper studio
till two hours ago,

48:06.831 --> 48:08.874
and now they're all Phil Spector.

48:09.834 --> 48:11.710
So what do you think?

48:12.087 --> 48:14.380
Are we just gonna cut
our losses here?

48:14.965 --> 48:16.548
Cut our losses?

48:17.008 --> 48:19.093
You didn't hear the
track before this one.

48:29.521 --> 48:32.147
It's the best thing I ever recorded.

48:32.732 --> 48:34.358
The best thing anyone in
this city ever recorded.

49:08.183 --> 49:09.851
Stop staring at us like that.

49:11.270 --> 49:13.354
You mad, one-eyed bastard.

49:15.357 --> 49:17.942
Thank you all for answering the call.

49:18.027 --> 49:20.320
Right, now, are you watching?

49:21.196 --> 49:24.114
You line the record up
with the top edge like this.

49:24.449 --> 49:28.493
Then fold along the
bottom line like this.

49:28.578 --> 49:32.372
Then fold down here
and fold down here.

49:32.457 --> 49:33.540
And there you have it.

49:34.334 --> 49:35.542
Magic.

49:35.835 --> 49:41.256
Again, here. Here.
Here. And here.

49:41.632 --> 49:42.758
Right?

49:42.842 --> 49:44.009
Now, let's get started.

50:21.546 --> 50:23.089
I think you've enough in there.

50:23.173 --> 50:24.840
Just in case.

50:26.093 --> 50:28.928
Calm. You'll be grand.

50:29.388 --> 50:31.347
I'm glad you think so.

50:31.431 --> 50:34.016
They'll never have
met anyone like you.

50:34.101 --> 50:36.018
I know I hadn't.

50:36.103 --> 50:37.728
Still haven't.

50:38.855 --> 50:42.316
- I just don't wanna give them
any excuse. - You won't.

50:45.611 --> 50:47.445
Gotta get in to work.

50:50.491 --> 50:53.076
Ruth was right.
It was only London.

50:57.748 --> 51:00.375
And what's London
ever given us?

51:02.086 --> 51:03.503
Apart from Ray Davies.

51:03.587 --> 51:05.463
And Joe Meek.
And John Lydon.

51:05.589 --> 51:08.216
And The Clash. And, er,
fuck, Abbey Road.

51:27.569 --> 51:29.319
Holy fuck.

51:31.030 --> 51:32.197
I know.

51:32.282 --> 51:35.742
Amazing how far a bit of charm and
labyrinthine narcotics connections

51:35.827 --> 51:37.744
will get a young man.

51:40.498 --> 51:43.292
Have you had a lot of dealings
with the music people?

51:43.460 --> 51:44.626
Fuck's sake, Terri.

51:45.295 --> 51:47.754
That's like asking a vet if he's
had his hand up a cow's arse.

51:57.640 --> 52:00.559
Hey, something to help
you on your way?

52:05.439 --> 52:08.191
Better not. Can't afford
to fuck this up.

52:10.694 --> 52:13.446
You'll fuck it up if
you're too tense.

52:14.198 --> 52:15.907
You need to go in there
like you mean it.

52:16.575 --> 52:17.700
Good point.

52:33.425 --> 52:35.343
- Where are the guns?
- Sorry?

52:35.594 --> 52:38.012
- The guns, the bombs, the tanks.
- Tanks?

52:38.096 --> 52:41.348
And the rage? I get told,
"Here's a punk band from Belfast."

52:41.432 --> 52:43.099
- Derry!
- I think, "Great.

52:43.184 --> 52:45.810
"No more pissing around.
This is gonna be darkness.

52:45.895 --> 52:47.729
"Proper darkness."

52:50.024 --> 52:51.942
And then I get this.

52:52.151 --> 52:53.276
Nihilism.

52:54.278 --> 52:57.656
If anything, sounds like they're
having too good a time.

52:58.908 --> 53:01.618
- They're no oil paintings, are they?
- No.

53:02.870 --> 53:05.288
Do they have any good-looking friends?

53:05.623 --> 53:08.792
And we love it when bands
sing in regional accents.

53:09.168 --> 53:12.254
But could they not pick
another region?

53:15.091 --> 53:16.383
- It's shit.
- Shit?

53:16.801 --> 53:18.760
- Yes, shit.
- It's not shit.

53:18.844 --> 53:20.011
- Yes, it is.
- Isn't.

53:20.096 --> 53:21.387
- Is!
- It's not!

53:21.471 --> 53:24.056
- Is.
- No.

53:24.933 --> 53:29.853
This... This, this is shit!

53:29.938 --> 53:31.981
Cathy, get security up here now!

53:32.107 --> 53:35.484
This, this here...
This one, this is shit!

53:36.069 --> 53:40.823
And this! This one,
this really is fucking shit!

53:41.157 --> 53:43.784
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

53:44.119 --> 53:48.831
Fascist pigs!
Nazi fucking bastards!

53:56.631 --> 53:57.798
Here.

53:59.134 --> 54:00.633
- Take it.
- No, thank you.

54:00.718 --> 54:02.260
Take it!

54:02.803 --> 54:06.055
What is wrong with you people?

54:06.140 --> 54:11.477
Is there not one person in this city who
recognises genius when it's handed to them?

54:22.823 --> 54:24.782
It's just that all packages
have to be signed in.

54:25.326 --> 54:26.659
Security.

54:27.828 --> 54:29.454
It's a piece of vinyl.

54:29.538 --> 54:30.997
New regulations.

54:31.081 --> 54:32.457
Well, can you not just sign for it?

54:32.833 --> 54:33.916
I'm afraid not.

54:34.960 --> 54:37.545
I've come all the way over from Belfast,
and to tell you the truth,

54:38.505 --> 54:40.505
I've fucked up a bit today.

54:41.007 --> 54:42.132
Sorry.

54:43.134 --> 54:44.384
Please.

54:44.510 --> 54:45.594
No.

54:59.817 --> 55:02.903
Terri? Terri Hooley?

55:04.238 --> 55:06.031
I don't believe it.

55:07.533 --> 55:08.950
Me neither.

55:09.035 --> 55:10.410
Is this man a friend of yours?

55:10.495 --> 55:14.498
I was doing a story in Belfast at New Year
and, er, wandered into his record shop.

55:14.624 --> 55:17.834
He had a 13th Floor Elevators album.

55:17.919 --> 55:19.377
Easter Everywhere.

55:19.795 --> 55:22.463
International Artists deleted it
after the year it was released.

55:22.673 --> 55:25.299
I'd searched all over London for it.

55:26.385 --> 55:28.427
What are you doing here?

55:29.012 --> 55:32.473
So, yes, that's one from the
Temple City Kazoo Orchestra,

55:32.557 --> 55:36.477
which I'm dedicating to anyone
with a dog or who is feeling down.

55:36.561 --> 55:39.188
This is BBC Radio 1,
the John Peel Radio Show...

55:39.272 --> 55:40.648
I can't listen to this.

55:41.024 --> 55:42.733
It's only been four nights.

55:42.818 --> 55:44.068
It's my fault.

55:44.486 --> 55:47.196
I should have run up those stairs
and handed it over myself.

55:47.823 --> 55:49.699
Would have been worth
being arrested.

55:51.076 --> 55:53.494
Did it ever occur to you
I might be listening to that?

55:55.497 --> 55:58.415
...get all of this stuff out of the
morning papers, incidentally.

56:03.879 --> 56:05.422
Terri.

56:09.427 --> 56:10.927
Terri!

56:17.893 --> 56:19.436
You missed it.

56:19.812 --> 56:21.521
Isn't that the best thing
you've ever heard?

56:22.189 --> 56:24.899
It's so good I'm gonna do
something I've never done before.

57:03.813 --> 57:05.647
Hello? Dave!

57:05.732 --> 57:09.276
I know, isn't it fantastic?
Twice in a row.

57:11.362 --> 57:15.073
John fucking Peel!

57:58.157 --> 58:02.661
Terri, there's a fella on the phone
says he's from Sire Records in London.

58:04.205 --> 58:06.998
Terri? The fella's hanging on here.

58:08.167 --> 58:11.419
Tell him, if he wants to talk to me,

58:11.546 --> 58:14.256
he can come over here and do it.

58:20.429 --> 58:23.223
Seymour Stein was
knocked out by Kicks.

58:23.850 --> 58:25.267
Kicks?

58:25.768 --> 58:28.520
He turned to me straight away and said,
"I want that band."

58:28.604 --> 58:32.232
That's how he was with the Ramones...
"I want that band."

58:32.275 --> 58:35.277
Well, I tell you, Paul, you don't have
to sell Seymour Stein to me.

58:35.403 --> 58:39.280
This is the man The Shangri-Las phoned
when they wanted to go back into the studio.

58:39.447 --> 58:41.448
You know that all came to nothing.

58:41.575 --> 58:46.036
But still, they called him.
The Shangri-Las!

58:55.463 --> 58:58.465
Seymour!
I've got the band here.

58:58.592 --> 59:00.801
- I'm passing you over to...
- Mickey.

59:00.886 --> 59:02.052
Mickey.

59:03.805 --> 59:06.974
How are you, Mr Stein?

59:07.058 --> 59:09.935
Aye, Paul told us about the offer.

59:10.770 --> 59:13.981
Well, tell you the truth,
we'd be looking at a bit more.

59:14.065 --> 59:16.149
- What? How much more?
- A lot more.

59:16.817 --> 59:19.319
Same as the Rich Kids got from EMI.

59:19.445 --> 59:21.988
Rich Kids, EMI? You know
what I'm offering you...

59:30.664 --> 59:32.624
Hey, we've come all the way
over here to make a deal...

59:32.750 --> 59:35.168
- What are you talking about?
- ... and we want to make a deal.

59:38.172 --> 59:39.839
Should you not be in
there advising us?

59:43.177 --> 59:45.595
You boys should be advising me.

59:47.306 --> 59:49.641
I thought for a moment back there
the whole thing was off.

59:50.851 --> 59:52.936
Never seen him quite so angry.

59:53.020 --> 59:55.020
Well, you got your band,
didn't you?

59:55.939 --> 59:58.523
- What about you, Terri?
- What about me?

59:58.608 --> 01:00:01.318
Well, you recorded Kicks.
It's on your label.

01:00:01.527 --> 01:00:04.529
You've got the wrong
idea about me, Paul.

01:00:04.781 --> 01:00:07.783
People who wouldn't piss on me when
I was hauling the record around London

01:00:07.867 --> 01:00:10.494
have been calling me up,
offering me £20,000 for it.

01:00:10.536 --> 01:00:12.704
Told them all to fuck off.

01:00:12.997 --> 01:00:14.665
Twenty thousand?

01:00:15.375 --> 01:00:17.542
Well, we can talk about this later.

01:00:17.669 --> 01:00:19.211
We can talk about it now.

01:00:19.462 --> 01:00:23.173
Getty's as much a part of
Good Vibrations as I am. They all are.

01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:26.802
How much is that van you
were looking at, Getty?

01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:30.889
550, but I reckon I can
get him down to 500.

01:00:31.724 --> 01:00:35.059
All right then, Paul.
500 quid.

01:00:38.355 --> 01:00:40.648
Are you sure you don't
wanna talk about it later?

01:00:42.901 --> 01:00:47.238
Five hundred quid and a signed
photo of The Shangri-Las.

01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:54.996
Okay.

01:00:57.499 --> 01:00:59.529
It's like my dad used to say,

01:00:59.938 --> 01:01:02.177
"If they can't buy you,
they can't own you."

01:01:02.212 --> 01:01:05.506
And it's not like that song was mine.
Teenage Kicks didn't belong to me.

01:01:05.674 --> 01:01:07.008
It belonged to everybody.

01:01:07.926 --> 01:01:11.429
And anyway, Rudi and The Outcasts
were gonna be even bigger.

01:01:12.389 --> 01:01:13.555
Well, weren't they?

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.686
First time in, Undertones
and Teenage Kicks.

01:01:28.571 --> 01:01:30.697
Does that make you think
a wee bit of the Beach Boys?

01:01:31.615 --> 01:01:34.701
Makes me think of that large
hole in Terri's bank account.

01:01:35.619 --> 01:01:37.787
You're starting to sound
like an accountant.

01:01:38.414 --> 01:01:40.582
You're turning me into one.

01:01:42.293 --> 01:01:45.045
Look at the state
of those trousers.

01:01:46.547 --> 01:01:48.465
How come they're on
TV and we're not?

01:01:48.591 --> 01:01:51.801
You write some new songs
and I'll get you on TV.

01:02:03.313 --> 01:02:04.938
Better be getting on here, anyway.

01:02:04.981 --> 01:02:06.231
Me, too.

01:02:06.316 --> 01:02:07.733
Aye, hold on.

01:02:09.736 --> 01:02:10.986
Terri Hooley?

01:02:11.488 --> 01:02:12.654
Yeah.

01:02:12.989 --> 01:02:14.448
The Godfather of Belfast Punk?

01:02:16.076 --> 01:02:17.993
We would like to make
an interview with you.

01:02:20.121 --> 01:02:23.499
So it all started for
you in 1977-'76?

01:02:23.625 --> 01:02:26.251
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
way before that.

01:02:27.003 --> 01:02:31.256
Here. Wait till I tell you.
It's in the '60s.

01:02:35.511 --> 01:02:37.470
Auf Wiedersehen, guys.

01:02:44.686 --> 01:02:46.187
Brought you your lunch.

01:02:46.647 --> 01:02:47.814
Thanks.

01:02:53.195 --> 01:02:54.862
About last night.

01:02:55.656 --> 01:02:57.865
You know me,
once I get started.

01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:59.700
Why d'you think I never
let you get started?

01:03:10.212 --> 01:03:11.711
I'm pregnant.

01:03:21.514 --> 01:03:22.681
Well?

01:03:23.891 --> 01:03:25.851
I'm gonna be a daddy.

01:03:31.149 --> 01:03:32.315
It's unbelievable.

01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:38.405
That's brilliant.

01:03:38.823 --> 01:03:41.491
D'you remember the day
we moved into the house?

01:03:42.243 --> 01:03:44.661
- You told me I was everything.
- And you didn't want to be.

01:03:44.745 --> 01:03:45.996
That's not what I said.

01:03:46.831 --> 01:03:47.998
I said...

01:03:48.082 --> 01:03:50.542
You'd settle for being the
most important thing.

01:03:53.545 --> 01:03:57.590
From now on, we'll both have to settle
for being the second most important.

01:04:35.794 --> 01:04:38.463
The first time you're told
you're gonna be a father,

01:04:38.589 --> 01:04:42.217
in the middle of all that joy and
excitement and anticipation,

01:04:43.302 --> 01:04:46.054
who doesn't shite themselves, too?

01:04:48.474 --> 01:04:51.601
But it was all gonna be absolutely fine.

01:04:51.644 --> 01:04:54.103
All I had to do was
work twice as hard,

01:04:54.146 --> 01:04:56.981
and make sure nothing
fell through the cracks.

01:05:32.183 --> 01:05:34.351
This is, er, Terri Hooley.

01:05:34.519 --> 01:05:37.145
Yes, that Terri Hooley.

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:41.024
Well, that's very nice
of you to say so.

01:05:42.777 --> 01:05:46.989
I've been watching your show.
Some decent bands on.

01:05:47.031 --> 01:05:49.865
Come on. How about putting
on a really great one?

01:05:52.369 --> 01:05:56.289
Brian, got some great news.

01:06:04.381 --> 01:06:06.382
- Youse over from London?
- Yeah.

01:06:07.718 --> 01:06:09.135
Brilliant. Youse want a drink?

01:06:09.219 --> 01:06:11.721
Hey, couple of pints
of horse piss, please.

01:07:14.074 --> 01:07:15.574
How did you manage that?

01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:19.953
What are you crying about?
Didn't I say I'd get you on TV?

01:07:20.413 --> 01:07:22.915
Aye, to promote the record.

01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:25.125
Where's the fucking record?

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:29.963
Did you phone the pressing plant?
Did they get the master?

01:07:32.634 --> 01:07:34.635
Those useless bastards.

01:07:35.261 --> 01:07:37.471
You knew months ago
we were gonna be on.

01:07:37.555 --> 01:07:39.139
All you had to do was put
the record out on time.

01:07:39.599 --> 01:07:40.641
All?

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.103
I've the shop.

01:07:44.646 --> 01:07:45.771
The Harp.

01:07:45.814 --> 01:07:48.147
You lot.
The Outcasts.

01:07:48.607 --> 01:07:50.066
Bank manager breathing
down my neck.

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:53.152
Oh, oh, and a wife who's about
to have a baby any day now.

01:07:53.237 --> 01:07:55.321
It was our big chance,
and you fucked it up.

01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:08.167
Come on to fuck out of this.

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:20.179
You going after them?

01:08:20.264 --> 01:08:22.014
Am I fuck!
I'm going to the Siouxsie gig.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.349
That's not for another six hours.

01:08:23.475 --> 01:08:25.184
Didn't say I was going straight
to the Siouxsie gig.

01:08:25.227 --> 01:08:27.144
Would you not be better
going home first?

01:08:29.147 --> 01:08:31.857
"My wife about to
have a baby any day."

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:35.026
The prison officer's murder
has been claimed

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:40.031
by the IRA in retaliation for what it calls
the inhuman treatment of their colleagues

01:08:40.073 --> 01:08:41.575
in the Maze Prison.

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:45.578
Loyalist paramilitaries, meantime,
have threatened to step up their attacks

01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:47.330
on the Catholic population.

01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:50.207
Now, two years ago,
troubles sparked

01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:54.671
between police and fans when
London punk rock band, The Clash,

01:08:54.755 --> 01:08:56.381
came to the Ulster Hall.

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:59.885
Tonight, the venue plays host
to another London band...

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:05.515
How are you, Ruth?
Terri?

01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:07.433
No, you just missed him, love.
He was here all afternoon.

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.060
...hostilities between punk-music
fans and the authorities,

01:09:11.188 --> 01:09:13.272
or have things moved
on in the interim?

01:09:13.398 --> 01:09:16.066
Our reporter, David Kappa,
is outside the hall

01:09:16.193 --> 01:09:19.528
with Belfast's own punk godfather,
Terri Hooley.

01:09:20.071 --> 01:09:23.741
I have to laugh at the great and
good when they talk about punks

01:09:23.867 --> 01:09:25.408
being a menace to society.

01:09:25.452 --> 01:09:27.620
We should be thanking 'em,
not hassling them.

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:31.207
These kids aren't the
problem for Belfast.

01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:33.542
These kids are the solution.

01:09:59.985 --> 01:10:01.736
Please pick up.

01:10:07.826 --> 01:10:10.286
Getty?
Are you not at the gig?

01:10:12.122 --> 01:10:14.082
You have to come and get me.

01:10:15.292 --> 01:10:17.835
Getty? This baby's coming.

01:10:34.852 --> 01:10:37.312
Just a couple more minutes, Ruth.
Look, I can see the gates.

01:11:16.727 --> 01:11:18.185
How long have you been here?

01:11:20.022 --> 01:11:21.188
Ten minutes.

01:11:23.025 --> 01:11:24.692
You should have woken me.

01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:27.695
Sleep when the baby sleeps,
that's what my mum says.

01:11:43.837 --> 01:11:45.045
What do you think?

01:11:45.838 --> 01:11:47.505
She looks like her mummy.

01:11:49.425 --> 01:11:52.218
- She's gorgeous.
- This is your daddy.

01:11:53.095 --> 01:11:54.721
He's an old charmer.

01:11:55.389 --> 01:11:56.598
Do you wanna hold her?

01:11:58.059 --> 01:12:00.560
My hands are shaking too much.
Probably drop her.

01:12:02.563 --> 01:12:04.064
It's just nerves.

01:12:10.237 --> 01:12:13.365
I couldn't get the champagne, Terri,
but if you shake this, it'll pop to fuck.

01:12:13.407 --> 01:12:15.617
Right, that's it.
Out, out, all of you.

01:12:15.743 --> 01:12:18.745
Right now. Out. Thank you.
Out, please.

01:12:19.121 --> 01:12:21.081
- Move! - I can't believe you
brought them with you.

01:12:22.083 --> 01:12:23.916
Sure, they're practically family.

01:12:24.751 --> 01:12:26.251
But they're not, Terri.

01:12:27.962 --> 01:12:29.755
We're your family.

01:12:38.056 --> 01:12:40.641
I can't do this any more.
I need to get out of Belfast for a while.

01:12:41.059 --> 01:12:42.142
Out of Belfast?

01:12:43.103 --> 01:12:45.437
A friend of Marilyn's has
a house in Helen's Bay.

01:12:50.568 --> 01:12:51.777
Are you telling me
you're leaving me?

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:54.071
I'm telling you everything's
different now.

01:12:55.448 --> 01:12:56.907
I love being with you.

01:12:59.285 --> 01:13:01.787
But I'm not afraid to do this
on my own if I have to.

01:13:02.414 --> 01:13:03.496
You won't have to.

01:13:04.832 --> 01:13:07.750
Terri! Terri! Terri!

01:13:08.252 --> 01:13:11.838
I need you to get those lads
off my ward this minute!

01:13:16.009 --> 01:13:17.468
I have to go.

01:13:20.013 --> 01:13:21.305
You do.

01:13:42.535 --> 01:13:44.870
...Belfast this afternoon...

01:13:44.996 --> 01:13:46.288
...since 1969.

01:13:46.330 --> 01:13:48.206
...five deaths are confirmed...

01:13:48.332 --> 01:13:51.334
...were blown to pieces.
Others lost limbs...

01:13:57.717 --> 01:14:01.511
...will continue their attacks
against so-called economic...

01:14:01.554 --> 01:14:04.014
...more than five thousand
bomb explosions...

01:14:04.056 --> 01:14:05.640
...the security forces...

01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:03.404
- Hello?
- Ruth?

01:15:10.579 --> 01:15:11.788
Hello?

01:15:12.414 --> 01:15:13.581
Ruth.

01:15:37.439 --> 01:15:39.482
You're drinking too much.

01:15:40.608 --> 01:15:42.234
Dave, I always drink too much.

01:15:42.277 --> 01:15:44.069
Everybody we know
drinks too much.

01:15:44.112 --> 01:15:45.779
Well, this is different.
There's something...

01:15:45.905 --> 01:15:47.447
Something what?

01:15:50.326 --> 01:15:52.619
You're carrying on like
one of Led Zeppelin.

01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:57.165
That's low.

01:16:01.462 --> 01:16:04.089
Anything else you'd like to say
while you're about it?

01:16:05.925 --> 01:16:08.760
I just think we have to try
to hold things together.

01:16:09.846 --> 01:16:11.138
Oh, do we?

01:16:11.848 --> 01:16:14.808
And will you tell us when
we can take a piss, Dave?

01:16:14.851 --> 01:16:17.185
Or scratch our fucking arse?

01:16:19.689 --> 01:16:20.813
Stalinist.

01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:24.317
Stalinist?

01:16:26.486 --> 01:16:27.987
Your dad's right.

01:16:30.532 --> 01:16:32.783
What are you talking about, my dad?

01:16:33.869 --> 01:16:35.995
You take on too much
because you love the glory.

01:16:36.997 --> 01:16:39.832
You're not a socialist at all.
You're a one-man fucking show.

01:16:41.126 --> 01:16:43.169
T - E - R - R capital I.

01:16:52.971 --> 01:16:54.722
Forgot your brandy.

01:16:57.142 --> 01:16:59.517
Your situation is really quite grave.

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.061
It's not just the overdraft.

01:17:01.187 --> 01:17:03.146
It's the accrued interest
on the original loan.

01:17:03.731 --> 01:17:05.190
It's your tax returns.

01:17:05.232 --> 01:17:07.025
I can't stress it enough.

01:17:07.151 --> 01:17:10.528
You are in real danger
of defaulting.

01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:13.865
You risk losing the shop
and your collateral.

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:17.035
Ruth.

01:17:19.038 --> 01:17:20.413
Our house.

01:17:21.916 --> 01:17:23.917
For God's sake, Terri,
why didn't you tell me?

01:17:25.086 --> 01:17:26.711
All those mornings...

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:30.256
Kids running away...
The fucking rain.

01:17:30.383 --> 01:17:32.759
I was telling myself,
"This is all right.

01:17:32.885 --> 01:17:35.387
"This was what allowed
us to open the shop."

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.555
And all the time...

01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:41.058
- It was our house.
- It was one moment.

01:17:43.061 --> 01:17:44.770
I wasn't thinking.

01:17:45.563 --> 01:17:47.231
I never thought.

01:17:47.899 --> 01:17:49.358
I just did it.

01:17:50.944 --> 01:17:53.737
It's the same as with Big Time,
I just did it.

01:17:54.406 --> 01:17:56.573
Same as with the tour,
I just did it.

01:17:57.909 --> 01:18:00.202
Teenage Kicks, the Harp,
I just did it.

01:18:00.578 --> 01:18:03.080
It's how I operate.
It's who I am.

01:18:03.915 --> 01:18:05.749
And you know what?

01:18:06.543 --> 01:18:08.293
I haven't done too badly.

01:18:09.587 --> 01:18:11.463
Open your eye, Terri.

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.701
We saw your light on.

01:18:44.204 --> 01:18:46.289
Thought I told you
you were barred.

01:18:50.127 --> 01:18:52.170
Fuck away off and find some
old ladies to frighten.

01:18:53.213 --> 01:18:56.049
You're very funny.
Isn't he, Hatchett?

01:18:56.133 --> 01:18:57.883
- Isn't he very funny?
- Oh, aye.

01:18:58.134 --> 01:18:59.634
Actually, this is a business call.

01:19:00.344 --> 01:19:01.553
Me and Hatchett's in a band now.

01:19:01.637 --> 01:19:02.804
- Aren't we, Hatchett?
- We are.

01:19:03.139 --> 01:19:04.306
Tight wee unit.

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:07.809
Fuck's sake!
Behave.

01:19:09.645 --> 01:19:11.980
Thought you might be in
interested in our demo tape.

01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:14.816
We were gonna call it The Only
Good Wog's A Dead Wog,

01:19:14.859 --> 01:19:17.194
and then we thought,
The Only Good Taig...

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.322
And then we thought,
The Only Good One's A Dead One.

01:19:20.865 --> 01:19:22.657
Covered pretty much everything.

01:19:24.327 --> 01:19:27.329
I'd sooner sell bog rolls
than Nazi shite like that.

01:19:27.747 --> 01:19:29.915
You'll sell what I tell you to sell.

01:19:30.083 --> 01:19:31.666
I'm used to getting me own way.

01:19:34.837 --> 01:19:37.505
Ask the fellas you used to say
would put me to bed.

01:19:40.092 --> 01:19:42.843
You made such a big deal
about not letting me in here.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.098
And look at it. It's fuck-all.
You're fuck-all.

01:19:47.432 --> 01:19:49.266
You're fucking lost.

01:20:35.896 --> 01:20:37.230
Open your eye.

01:20:38.774 --> 01:20:40.900
Very funny. The other one.

01:20:46.407 --> 01:20:47.740
That must have been some door.

01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:51.411
What was it, a car ferry?

01:20:52.663 --> 01:20:54.789
Don't suppose there's any point
in me mentioning the police?

01:20:55.457 --> 01:20:57.624
They'd probably wanna
buy the door a drink.

01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:01.420
I never knew a wee boy as bad at
keeping his head out of harm's way.

01:21:01.921 --> 01:21:03.964
And what does Ruth
think about all this?

01:21:05.633 --> 01:21:06.800
Here.

01:21:08.094 --> 01:21:09.928
Did your mother send
you out with that?

01:21:10.471 --> 01:21:12.848
Thought I'd better offer
before she put the window in.

01:21:14.267 --> 01:21:16.435
She's getting herself worked up
about me and Ruth.

01:21:16.477 --> 01:21:18.854
She has very strong
views on marriage.

01:21:19.647 --> 01:21:22.441
She wouldn't have stayed with me
all these years otherwise.

01:21:40.375 --> 01:21:43.336
You remember that dig you had at me
about all those elections?

01:21:44.963 --> 01:21:46.631
- Dad, look, I'm...
- It wasn't ten.

01:21:47.633 --> 01:21:49.133
It was 12.

01:21:49.551 --> 01:21:50.718
The Returning Officer used to say

01:21:50.802 --> 01:21:53.221
if I was a horse, they would
have shot me after the sixth.

01:21:54.348 --> 01:21:55.806
But do you know what?

01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:59.727
I have friends and comrades
living all over this city.

01:22:00.479 --> 01:22:01.979
And do you know what else?

01:22:02.856 --> 01:22:05.524
In every election I increased my vote.

01:22:08.862 --> 01:22:12.698
Victory doesn't always look
the way other people imagine it.

01:22:46.732 --> 01:22:48.024
Right.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.361
Couple of apologies are in order.

01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:55.864
- Brian, do you wanna start?
- Who...

01:22:56.032 --> 01:22:57.283
I'm only messing you.

01:22:58.868 --> 01:23:00.035
Dave?

01:23:00.704 --> 01:23:02.121
I hold my hand up.

01:23:02.455 --> 01:23:04.873
I've taken me eye off the ball,
but there's no time to argue.

01:23:05.542 --> 01:23:07.042
It's time to focus.

01:23:07.544 --> 01:23:09.878
We got a gig to organise.

01:23:11.214 --> 01:23:13.465
- A gig?
- A Good Vibrations gig.

01:23:14.050 --> 01:23:15.718
- A fundraiser?
- Yeah, a fundraiser.

01:23:16.636 --> 01:23:18.762
No harm to you, Terri,
but unless you're charging

01:23:18.888 --> 01:23:19.930
a hundred quid a head,

01:23:20.056 --> 01:23:22.224
I don't think a night at the Harp's
gonna save you.

01:23:22.309 --> 01:23:23.726
Who said anything about the Harp?

01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:25.144
At The Pound, then.

01:23:25.979 --> 01:23:27.146
Ooh, the Students' Union.

01:23:28.398 --> 01:23:31.066
Try Ulster Hall.

01:23:33.569 --> 01:23:34.777
Why not?

01:23:34.903 --> 01:23:37.905
Well, because the Ulster Hall
holds 2,000 people.

01:23:38.407 --> 01:23:41.576
I know how many people it holds.
I've been in it often enough.

01:23:46.165 --> 01:23:47.582
Okay, we'll call in favours.

01:23:47.624 --> 01:23:49.584
We'll get Siouxsie back to headline.

01:23:50.085 --> 01:23:52.795
Oh, fuck it, er, we'll call The Clash,
Stiff Little Fingers...

01:23:52.921 --> 01:23:55.340
Fucking show bands.
We don't need them.

01:23:55.966 --> 01:23:59.844
It's a Good Vibrations gig.
It's gonna be Good Vibrations bands.

01:24:00.679 --> 01:24:03.681
Terri, we're talking 2,000 people.
Be realistic.

01:24:04.099 --> 01:24:05.141
What?

01:24:05.267 --> 01:24:08.603
Like you were realistic when you
brought us round this place?

01:24:19.989 --> 01:24:21.990
How many posters do
you think you'll need?

01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:32.125
We're fucking back!

01:25:28.723 --> 01:25:31.392
Northern Ireland, for reasons
best known to itself,

01:25:31.518 --> 01:25:34.394
is the last great stronghold
of the punk world.

01:25:34.687 --> 01:25:37.856
The Ulster Hall bill tonight represents
the largest-ever gathering here

01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:41.067
of homebred punk and
New Wave bands on one stage.

01:25:48.075 --> 01:25:49.868
Where the fuck is everyone?

01:25:50.202 --> 01:25:53.037
It'll be all right. They'll come.

01:25:55.291 --> 01:25:57.542
You know we've
hardly sold a ticket?

01:26:04.884 --> 01:26:08.720
- It's John fucking Peel.
- Always nice to get the full name.

01:26:10.723 --> 01:26:12.890
I can't believe you're here.

01:26:12.932 --> 01:26:15.893
You gave me the best two minutes
and 28 seconds of my life.

01:26:15.935 --> 01:26:17.311
How could I not come?

01:26:17.729 --> 01:26:19.062
I'm just glad I got here in one piece.

01:26:19.731 --> 01:26:22.232
- Rough journey?
- Oh, no, the flight was fine.

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:23.817
I mean getting through the
doors of this place.

01:26:28.615 --> 01:26:30.908
You mean you haven't had a look
out the front?

01:26:37.832 --> 01:26:39.791
Can you not just throw
the doors open?

01:26:40.084 --> 01:26:42.085
I'd be within my rights
to shut them altogether.

01:26:42.128 --> 01:26:43.295
Half of them are full drunk

01:26:43.421 --> 01:26:45.297
and the other half are trying
to run in without paying.

01:26:45.757 --> 01:26:47.007
Terri!

01:26:47.842 --> 01:26:49.009
Hey, he's on the guest list.

01:26:49.802 --> 01:26:51.010
Come on, move your arse!

01:26:51.094 --> 01:26:52.428
What about my mates?

01:26:52.679 --> 01:26:54.096
Hurry up, hurry up.

01:27:24.962 --> 01:27:26.712
- It's too many.
- Ah, don't worry, it'll be fine.

01:27:28.465 --> 01:27:29.632
Jesus Christ.

01:27:49.902 --> 01:27:52.153
Rudi! Rudi! Rudi!

01:28:04.375 --> 01:28:05.875
You're a good audience.

01:28:06.002 --> 01:28:08.920
People always say
Belfast is the best audience.

01:28:09.005 --> 01:28:10.879
And now here's your best band.

01:28:11.006 --> 01:28:12.214
The Outcasts.

01:29:14.818 --> 01:29:16.819
- Cool, Terri, great night.
- All right, Terri? Thanks, mate.

01:29:25.204 --> 01:29:27.497
Isn't it incredible?

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:29.956
It's fucking unbelievable.

01:29:30.041 --> 01:29:33.502
- Best night ever.
- Terri, we've made a loss.

01:29:35.588 --> 01:29:37.297
We have packed out
the Ulster Hall

01:29:37.382 --> 01:29:39.591
and we've somehow
made a fucking loss.

01:29:41.469 --> 01:29:42.928
Your man at the front says

01:29:43.012 --> 01:29:45.681
you had the longest guest list
in the Hall's entire history.

01:29:45.765 --> 01:29:48.183
Longer than all the other
guest lists put together,

01:29:48.267 --> 01:29:50.936
and all of it, apparently,
carried in your head.

01:29:52.647 --> 01:29:53.897
Terri.

01:29:54.982 --> 01:29:58.360
The whole point of tonight
was to raise money for your shop.

01:29:59.362 --> 01:30:00.737
No, Dave.

01:30:01.447 --> 01:30:03.573
No, it wasn't,
not the whole point.

01:30:04.450 --> 01:30:08.244
Money couldn't buy
what we've just done.

01:30:23.468 --> 01:30:25.469
You and your guest lists.

01:30:39.443 --> 01:30:40.818
I'm sorry.

01:30:43.697 --> 01:30:45.239
Sure, it's only bricks.

01:30:48.117 --> 01:30:50.201
Terri! Terri! Terri!

01:30:55.791 --> 01:30:57.208
You're wanted.

01:31:01.756 --> 01:31:03.590
But you still owe me 40 quid.

01:31:16.896 --> 01:31:19.814
I've made some bad
decisions in my life.

01:31:19.899 --> 01:31:22.609
I haven't been on the
winning side very often.

01:31:22.693 --> 01:31:26.070
But there were no winning
sides back then. So...

01:31:26.529 --> 01:31:31.074
Like my dad said, the trick was
to get yourself on the right side.

01:31:31.159 --> 01:31:32.367
The side of the angels.

01:31:32.452 --> 01:31:35.996
Hey, Terri is our leader.
Terri is our...

01:31:36.873 --> 01:31:40.209
No leaders.
No godfathers.

01:31:42.879 --> 01:31:44.922
Thank you for coming.

01:31:49.427 --> 01:31:52.262
When I look out at youse
all gathered here,

01:31:53.389 --> 01:31:56.141
it confirms something
I've always felt.

01:31:57.185 --> 01:31:59.144
When it comes to punk,

01:31:59.854 --> 01:32:03.440
New York has the haircuts,

01:32:04.317 --> 01:32:08.110
London has the trousers,

01:32:08.654 --> 01:32:11.906
but Belfast has the reason!

01:32:17.871 --> 01:32:20.915
Good Vibrations isn't a record shop.

01:32:20.999 --> 01:32:22.500
It's not a label.

01:32:23.210 --> 01:32:25.002
It's a way of life!

01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:37.390
We're gonna do an old
Sonny Bono number...

01:32:37.474 --> 01:32:38.933
because we fucking can.
