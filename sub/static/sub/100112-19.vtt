Friends. Family.

00:06.521 --> 00:07.788
Ed.

00:09.316 --> 00:10.416
Ante in.

00:10.417 --> 00:11.784
I'm your dad's half-brother.

00:11.785 --> 00:13.920
That makes me family. Dork.

00:13.921 --> 00:15.388
Dork says what?

00:15.389 --> 00:17.690
- I'm not falling for that.
- What?

00:19.026 --> 00:20.026
Damn it.

00:21.361 --> 00:22.695
Hold on.

00:22.696 --> 00:25.431
There's some news
emanatin' from this region.

00:26.366 --> 00:28.301
There are no changes in my regions.

00:29.369 --> 00:30.736
No, wait, wait.

00:30.737 --> 00:33.306
Free Bird is onto something here.

00:33.307 --> 00:35.007
Eyebrows. They're darker.

00:35.008 --> 00:36.008
That's right.

00:36.009 --> 00:37.710
Somebody's got a big date tonight.

00:37.711 --> 00:39.412
Do the drapes match the curtains?

00:41.548 --> 00:44.517
Dude, that's not even a thing.

00:44.518 --> 00:46.586
In the interest of ever
playing a hand of poker,

00:46.587 --> 00:48.654
yes, I am seeing Louise tonight,

00:48.655 --> 00:50.823
and the Men's Health magazine
at my barbershop

00:50.824 --> 00:52.492
told me that getting rid of the gray

00:52.493 --> 00:54.927
takes years off
the top part of your face.

00:55.863 --> 00:57.196
Yeah, that'll work.

00:57.197 --> 00:58.898
As long as you hide
the bottom part with a...

00:58.899 --> 01:00.666
fan, like an old-timey Southern belle.

01:00.667 --> 01:03.169
I do declare,
you will never see my mouth.

01:05.772 --> 01:09.275
I kindly ask that you do not
appropriate my culture.

01:13.413 --> 01:14.814
So, big date, huh?

01:14.815 --> 01:17.216
Is tonight the night
you're gonna butter the biscuit?

01:18.986 --> 01:24.891
Yes. It is very likely that tonight,
Louise and I will butter the biscuit.

01:24.892 --> 01:26.759
And I don't want to hear
any more about it.

01:26.760 --> 01:29.262
- Understood.
- Okay.

01:29.263 --> 01:30.530
So, you nervous?

01:31.565 --> 01:34.233
I am nervous as hell.

01:34.234 --> 01:36.369
I was with the same woman for 45 years,

01:36.370 --> 01:38.471
and I never thought I'd be
unlucky enough to lose her.

01:38.472 --> 01:40.406
And I never thought I'd be lucky enough

01:40.407 --> 01:41.574
to find someone else,

01:41.575 --> 01:43.776
and I-I don't want to blow it.

01:43.777 --> 01:46.445
Well, then you better think twice
about the Groucho eyebrows

01:46.446 --> 01:48.147
and that CPAP mask you wear every night.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.449
What's a CPAP mask?

01:50.450 --> 01:52.785
It's a mask attached by a hose to a pump

01:52.786 --> 01:54.186
that forces air down my throat

01:54.187 --> 01:56.589
so I don't stop breathing
in the middle of the night.

01:56.590 --> 01:58.024
So you look like Tom Cruise in "Top Gun"

01:58.025 --> 02:00.726
if he was an old man
who couldn't breathe on his own.

02:02.729 --> 02:04.997
Who else has a date tonight?

02:09.636 --> 02:11.804
But you guys helped me make a decision.

02:11.805 --> 02:14.140
I'm not bringing the CPAP mask over.

02:14.141 --> 02:16.275
Oh. You're rollin' the dice there, Dan.

02:16.276 --> 02:18.411
Not wearing the mask could kill ya.

02:18.412 --> 02:20.012
Oh, would you quit it?

02:20.013 --> 02:23.015
He's not gonna die
from not wearing the mask.

02:23.016 --> 02:25.051
He's gonna die from the sex.

02:52.779 --> 03:00.554
The Conners - S02E19 - SEASON FINALE
CPAPs, Hickeys and Biscuits

03:04.550 --> 03:05.858
"The Conners" is recorded

03:05.859 --> 03:07.660
in front of a live studio audience.

03:10.030 --> 03:12.465
Hey. I have been trying to reach you.

03:12.466 --> 03:13.633
Are you okay?

03:13.634 --> 03:15.067
I'm going to jail.

03:16.370 --> 03:17.470
I'm going to jail, right?

03:17.471 --> 03:18.971
Absolutely.

03:20.207 --> 03:23.175
What did you do?

03:23.176 --> 03:24.644
Do I need to come and bail ya out?

03:24.645 --> 03:26.512
No, no. I don't want to
waste the money,

03:26.513 --> 03:27.880
and honestly, I could use the night off.

03:28.982 --> 03:31.851
I refused to sign the ticket
for texting at a stoplight,

03:31.852 --> 03:33.586
and apparently, there are certain things

03:33.587 --> 03:36.322
you can't say to a cop,
like "You work for me"

03:36.323 --> 03:38.357
or "Maybe if you had
a salad once in a while,

03:38.358 --> 03:39.925
you might've made fireman."

03:41.428 --> 03:44.063
Okay. Well, I can spend
the night here with the kids.

03:44.064 --> 03:45.131
Thank you.

03:45.132 --> 03:49.402
Remember, lights out at 11:00,
and make sure all the stove burners

03:49.403 --> 03:50.770
are in the off position

03:50.771 --> 03:52.905
so the gas doesn't kill
everybody in their sleep.

03:52.906 --> 03:55.574
So don't kill the children
or blow up the house.

03:55.575 --> 03:58.611
Got it. Okay, have fun. Make friends.

03:59.946 --> 04:01.681
Is it okay if Harper spends the night,

04:01.682 --> 04:03.215
or do I have to wait to ask Mom

04:03.216 --> 04:05.584
when the police give her
her one phone call?

04:06.586 --> 04:08.554
- Ya heard that, huh?
- Yeah.

04:08.555 --> 04:09.689
We have a lot to do

04:09.690 --> 04:11.123
to finish our Earth Day
science fair project.

04:11.124 --> 04:13.426
- Oh.
- It's a solar hot dog cooker.

04:14.661 --> 04:15.761
It was Mark's idea.

04:15.762 --> 04:18.329
My mom says global warming is a hoax

04:18.331 --> 04:20.632
because it gets cold at night.

04:22.069 --> 04:23.669
She's an idiot.

04:25.972 --> 04:27.773
And I figured since hot dogs

04:27.774 --> 04:29.909
are our family's main source of food...

04:29.910 --> 04:32.178
...and we regularly have
the power turned off,

04:32.179 --> 04:33.779
this would be worth learning.

04:35.882 --> 04:38.984
Okay, well, I-I think I can make
this decision without your mom.

04:38.985 --> 04:41.454
Harper can stay over,
but where's she gonna sleep?

04:41.455 --> 04:42.621
Uh, my room.

04:42.622 --> 04:45.458
She can use Harris' bed
since she's at Odessa's tonight,

04:45.459 --> 04:47.259
and we probably won't even sleep anyway,

04:47.260 --> 04:48.561
we have so much work to do.

04:48.562 --> 04:49.895
Huh. Okay.

04:49.896 --> 04:52.798
Uh, but you need to call your mom
and make sure it's okay with her.

04:52.799 --> 04:55.067
I already did. She said it's fine.

04:55.068 --> 04:56.669
Oh.

04:59.372 --> 05:01.507
Uh, hey.

05:04.745 --> 05:06.579
You're still gay, right?

05:08.815 --> 05:11.250
Yep. All day, every day.

05:12.686 --> 05:15.821
Good for you. You stay the course.

05:51.725 --> 05:53.726
W-Where are you going?

05:53.727 --> 05:55.861
You're... You're not
going home, are you?

05:55.862 --> 05:57.830
Look, I-I really was gonna go home.

05:57.831 --> 05:59.365
Uh...

05:59.366 --> 06:01.467
If the kids are up and I'm not there,

06:01.468 --> 06:03.035
they're gonna ask a million questions.

06:03.036 --> 06:04.470
Hey.

06:04.471 --> 06:06.839
You're the one who wanted
a committed relationship.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.141
Not running away is a part of that,

06:09.142 --> 06:11.911
so come on, get back in bed.

06:13.847 --> 06:16.849
I wanted a relationship before I
knew how bossy you were gonna be.

06:16.850 --> 06:18.851
Oh.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.754
What are you doing?

06:55.755 --> 06:58.023
Hunting wabbits. Be vewy quiet.

06:58.024 --> 07:00.259
Oh.

07:00.260 --> 07:03.863
I think sex scrambled your brain.

07:03.864 --> 07:05.631
You're acting really weird.

07:06.766 --> 07:08.767
We can talk in the morning.

07:08.768 --> 07:10.536
I hope so.

07:14.108 --> 07:17.342
Hey!

07:17.343 --> 07:19.378
Welcome back to society.

07:19.446 --> 07:21.948
Things have changed
since they put you away.

07:21.949 --> 07:23.483
This is a phone.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.853
You can send words through
the air to other phones.

07:28.455 --> 07:31.524
Yeah, and when you went in,
there was only one "NCIS,"

07:31.525 --> 07:34.594
and now there's one in
every city in the land.

07:36.597 --> 07:38.631
Uh, Harris, can you leave for a moment?

07:38.632 --> 07:39.966
Ben and I need to talk.

07:39.967 --> 07:41.801
Oh. Oh, I'm not Harris.

07:41.802 --> 07:43.770
I'm Harris' daughter.

07:43.771 --> 07:46.372
Are you Nana Darlene?

07:48.342 --> 07:51.010
Hilarious. Get out.
I need to talk to Ben.

07:51.011 --> 07:53.379
I do not like
what prison has done to you.

07:55.616 --> 07:58.184
Okay, I still don't understand.

07:58.185 --> 08:01.287
Why would you let Harper
sleep in Mark's room?

08:01.288 --> 08:02.855
Do you know how embarrassing it was

08:02.856 --> 08:04.557
to get a message from her mother

08:04.558 --> 08:06.292
saying her daughter
came home with a hickey?

08:06.293 --> 08:07.694
Hey.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.796
I asked Mark right
before he went upstairs,

08:09.797 --> 08:12.865
"Are you still gay?" And he said yes.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.603
It doesn't matter if he's gay.

08:16.604 --> 08:18.671
Kids at that age are experimenting.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.173
Well, hey, in my defense,

08:20.174 --> 08:22.976
I took away their caffeinated soda.

08:22.977 --> 08:25.645
Well, apparently,
Mark was still thirsty,

08:25.646 --> 08:27.714
because he was trying
to get liquid from her neck.

08:29.449 --> 08:30.817
It's just a hickey!

08:30.818 --> 08:32.217
Oh, how do you know?

08:32.219 --> 08:34.953
We have no idea what they did
until we talk to Mark.

08:34.955 --> 08:37.256
Well, maybe we should
wait to talk to Mark, then,

08:37.256 --> 08:39.091
before you jump all over my ass.

08:39.092 --> 08:40.760
- Oh, fine.
- Fine.

08:45.399 --> 08:48.034
How long 'til Mark
gets home from school?

08:48.035 --> 08:49.836
About five hours.

08:52.206 --> 08:55.308
That is... a long time.

08:57.945 --> 08:59.779
Sorry I'm late.

08:59.780 --> 09:01.280
Beverly Rose wouldn't let me go

09:01.281 --> 09:03.282
when I went to drop her off
at the tÃ­as'.

09:03.283 --> 09:04.951
I'm not used to being this adored.

09:04.952 --> 09:07.086
It's exhausting!

09:07.087 --> 09:08.621
Yeah, you went through a phase

09:08.622 --> 09:10.323
where I couldn't put you down.

09:10.324 --> 09:12.258
I'd just rub a little
whiskey on your gums.

09:12.259 --> 09:14.026
After some dancing
around in your diaper,

09:14.027 --> 09:16.128
you'd keel right over.

09:16.129 --> 09:19.498
Hey, that's another piece
of my alcoholic puzzle.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.436
Man, the tÃ­as are still
on me to marry Emilio

09:23.437 --> 09:25.037
to help him get back into the country.

09:25.038 --> 09:27.139
Tell me you're not
actually considering this.

09:27.140 --> 09:28.908
I don't know.

09:28.909 --> 09:31.444
He's Beverly Rose's dad,
and he deserves to see her.

09:31.445 --> 09:33.079
The only problem is,

09:33.080 --> 09:34.947
to make it look like a real marriage,

09:34.948 --> 09:37.884
I'd have to live with him
for a least a couple years.

09:37.885 --> 09:40.620
That's gonna make it awkward
to bring home dates.

09:40.621 --> 09:41.988
She's right.

09:41.989 --> 09:45.024
Most guys don't even like it
when you have a cat.

09:45.025 --> 09:46.926
What are you doing?

09:46.927 --> 09:49.762
You'd be committing a federal crime
for a guy you don't even love.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.964
I don't love him.

09:51.965 --> 09:53.165
But the tÃ­as said

09:53.166 --> 09:56.402
lots of people grow to love
the person after they marry.

09:56.403 --> 09:58.838
Well, they don't really
have a dog in this fight,

09:58.839 --> 10:01.274
so I guess they're being
totally objective.

10:01.275 --> 10:02.842
Heeey.

10:02.843 --> 10:05.478
You grew to love Adam Sandler.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.847
When everybody said
after "Billy Madison"

10:07.848 --> 10:10.216
that he was a waste of time,
you hung in there.

10:11.385 --> 10:13.286
And then "Happy Gilmore"
turned you around,

10:13.287 --> 10:15.855
and then "The Waterboy."

10:15.856 --> 10:18.457
Now you got to watch that
every time it comes on.

10:18.458 --> 10:20.359
Okay, okay, okay.

10:20.360 --> 10:23.029
Let's just say Emilio does turn out

10:23.030 --> 10:25.965
to be as great as Mr. Adam Sandler.

10:25.966 --> 10:30.002
When you say live with him,
where exactly would that be?

10:30.003 --> 10:32.371
I'm asking for my friend...

10:32.372 --> 10:33.806
My friend Dan Conner.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.511
- Please?
- Mm.

10:38.512 --> 10:41.547
What is going on with you, huh?

10:41.548 --> 10:44.050
I mean, the coffee isn't even that good.

10:44.051 --> 10:45.985
I ran out of filters this morning.

10:45.986 --> 10:47.887
I had to use an old T-shirt.

10:47.888 --> 10:49.956
Oh. No? Okay.

10:51.491 --> 10:53.025
I was up all night.

10:53.026 --> 10:54.627
I stayed at Louise's,
and I didn't want her

10:54.628 --> 10:56.028
to see me in my CPAP,

10:56.029 --> 10:58.864
so I had to stay awake or die.

10:58.865 --> 11:00.566
Look, she's already heard you

11:00.567 --> 11:02.068
trying to get out of a chair,

11:02.069 --> 11:03.736
and she still wants to be with you.

11:03.737 --> 11:05.571
Trust her a little bit.

11:05.572 --> 11:07.907
She likes you because
you're funny and you're solid

11:07.908 --> 11:10.910
and you have the... the... the wisdom
that comes with experience.

11:10.911 --> 11:12.611
Why don't you try using some of that?

11:12.612 --> 11:14.347
Look, I just think when she rolls over

11:14.348 --> 11:15.881
and sees me in that rig,

11:15.882 --> 11:18.217
it's gonna be like
waking up next to her dad.

11:18.218 --> 11:19.518
Eh.

11:19.519 --> 11:21.287
Some women like that, Dan.

11:25.525 --> 11:27.026
Oh, love the turtleneck.

11:27.027 --> 11:28.894
How's that sculpting class
you're teaching

11:28.895 --> 11:30.997
at the community college going?

11:32.399 --> 11:34.700
I was looking at myself
in the mirror last night,

11:34.701 --> 11:38.004
and I was put off
by my unusually long neck.

11:41.274 --> 11:42.975
Fine.

11:42.976 --> 11:45.111
Oh, God!

11:45.112 --> 11:46.879
You got one, too?!

11:48.048 --> 11:50.483
We had a deal. You were gay!

11:52.085 --> 11:54.120
It's not what you think.

11:54.121 --> 11:57.690
Harper has a new boyfriend
and wanted to practice kissing.

11:57.691 --> 12:00.393
The next thing I knew,
she went all "Twilight" on my neck,

12:00.394 --> 12:02.695
even though she knows I'm Team Jacob.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.234
And then she asked me to give her one.

12:08.235 --> 12:10.002
Well, did anything else happen?

12:10.003 --> 12:11.137
No!

12:11.138 --> 12:12.972
Okay. Go upstairs.

12:12.973 --> 12:15.574
Oh, and when your Aunt Becky gets home,

12:15.575 --> 12:17.209
have her teach you
how to cover that thing up.

12:17.210 --> 12:20.079
By the time she was 15,
she was more hickey than Becky.

12:23.717 --> 12:24.917
See?

12:24.918 --> 12:28.120
It's just a practice hickey.

12:28.121 --> 12:30.089
No harm, no foul.

12:31.058 --> 12:34.160
Hmm? I think I deserve an apology.

12:34.161 --> 12:36.796
I don't owe you an apology at all.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.931
Something much worse could've happened.

12:38.932 --> 12:42.034
But it didn't, so why
are you still pissed off?

12:42.035 --> 12:43.436
You know what? I would just prefer

12:43.437 --> 12:46.272
if you'd run any parenting
decisions by me from now on.

12:46.273 --> 12:49.008
I can usually be reached
when I'm not behind bars.

12:51.078 --> 12:53.813
Uh, you know, we've been
together for a while now,

12:53.814 --> 12:56.449
and at some point,
you are gonna have to trust me

12:56.450 --> 12:59.018
to make some decisions about the kids.

12:59.019 --> 13:02.488
Ben, the kids love and respect you,

13:02.489 --> 13:05.357
which proves that you know
nothing about parenting.

13:07.027 --> 13:09.862
Have you ever even told the kids
that they should listen to me?

13:09.863 --> 13:12.164
Well, I never thought about it,
because you're not their dad.

13:12.165 --> 13:14.700
Yeah, I know that, okay?

13:14.701 --> 13:17.103
Thank you for defining what I am not.

13:17.104 --> 13:18.504
How about defining what I am?

13:18.505 --> 13:20.840
And why stop with the kids?
What am I to you?

13:20.841 --> 13:22.208
W-What are you talking about?

13:22.209 --> 13:23.676
I mean, we're trying to have a baby,

13:23.677 --> 13:25.444
but you don't want to get married,

13:25.445 --> 13:28.614
we don't even live together.
I don't know what this is.

13:28.615 --> 13:30.683
Wait, hang on. Hang on.

13:32.052 --> 13:34.086
Calm down.

13:34.087 --> 13:36.088
Is this something
sex would take care of?

13:39.159 --> 13:40.960
No!

13:49.287 --> 13:50.621
You've been washing that dish

13:50.622 --> 13:51.922
for about three minutes.

13:51.923 --> 13:54.191
The Holiday Inn logo's
starting to come off.

13:55.994 --> 13:57.195
What's going on?

13:57.196 --> 13:58.362
Um...

13:58.363 --> 14:00.031
Can I ask you something?

14:00.032 --> 14:01.399
Yeah, sure.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.869
You raised your kids alone.
You know how hard it is.

14:04.870 --> 14:07.004
Is it nuts for me to marry Emilio

14:07.005 --> 14:09.106
so he can come here
and help me with the baby?

14:09.107 --> 14:11.609
Oh, Ben has been on my ass lately

14:11.610 --> 14:13.744
to be more involved with my kids.

14:13.745 --> 14:15.246
He loves your baby. Put him to work.

14:15.247 --> 14:17.248
Maybe he'll stop driving me crazy.

14:18.217 --> 14:19.550
Me!

14:19.551 --> 14:22.153
We're fixing me, you narcissist!

14:23.055 --> 14:25.389
If I marry him, I have
to live with him for two years

14:25.390 --> 14:26.657
and give up any chance

14:26.658 --> 14:28.926
of meeting someone I might really love.

14:28.927 --> 14:30.895
Oh. I wouldn't do that.

14:30.896 --> 14:33.030
Don't miss your chance
to meet the right person.

14:33.031 --> 14:34.966
It could happen at any time.
I mean, look.

14:34.967 --> 14:37.435
I didn't think I could
fall in love again, and I did.

14:37.436 --> 14:39.470
I just got all the stuff I left here

14:39.471 --> 14:42.557
from the cardboard box you said
was "better than a drawer."

14:43.475 --> 14:44.909
I'm outta here.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.780
What's your secret?
How do I get what you have?

14:51.783 --> 14:53.384
I don't get it.

14:53.385 --> 14:55.052
Why are you pushing him away?

15:03.195 --> 15:06.130
Ben, don't go.

15:06.131 --> 15:08.065
I need a break.

15:08.066 --> 15:09.300
I'm just... I'm tired

15:09.301 --> 15:11.969
of being in this weird, amorphous,

15:11.970 --> 15:14.705
undefined, mid-life relationship.

15:14.706 --> 15:18.042
I think you just defined it
really beautifully.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.877
Look, if we're not moving forward,

15:19.878 --> 15:22.013
then we're just wasting our time.

15:22.014 --> 15:23.547
So give me one good reason

15:23.548 --> 15:24.915
why you don't want to live with me.

15:24.916 --> 15:26.484
No.

15:26.485 --> 15:28.719
I don't not want to live with you.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.088
What?

15:33.358 --> 15:35.893
Look, this is just really hard for me.

15:35.894 --> 15:38.296
I do want to live with you.

15:38.297 --> 15:40.898
I guess I'm scared.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.833
You know, the last time
my life fell apart,

15:42.834 --> 15:43.934
I came back here.

15:43.935 --> 15:45.169
And now I feel safe,

15:45.170 --> 15:47.004
and you want me to go
back out there again.

15:47.005 --> 15:49.040
What, don't you feel safe with me?

15:49.041 --> 15:50.074
Yeah.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.276
But I'm screwed up,

15:52.277 --> 15:55.112
you know, and...

15:55.113 --> 15:58.015
It's just... I feel like
if it doesn't work out,

15:58.016 --> 16:00.484
it might be because of me.

16:00.485 --> 16:02.720
You know, I can't fail again.

16:02.721 --> 16:04.121
Wait.

16:04.122 --> 16:07.024
I know you're screwed up,
and I still want to live with ya.

16:07.025 --> 16:09.060
That makes me more screwed up than you.

16:09.061 --> 16:10.995
So...

16:10.996 --> 16:13.531
If it fails, it'll be my fault.

16:13.532 --> 16:15.800
This shouldn't make me
feel better, but it does.

16:16.802 --> 16:18.703
That's because you're screwed up!

16:20.539 --> 16:22.039
Okay.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.607
That's it. I'm taking the leap.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.276
We should live together.

16:25.277 --> 16:28.012
I don't know.

16:30.949 --> 16:34.285
This is all just... so sudden.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.421
It's gonna take me a while to pack.

16:37.422 --> 16:40.291
Oh, look! I'm all ready to go.

16:44.763 --> 16:45.796
Hi.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.032
Hey.

16:48.033 --> 16:49.567
Wow.

16:49.568 --> 16:51.736
I didn't take you as a toys kind of guy.

16:54.673 --> 16:57.575
Uh, I've done some crazy things,

16:57.576 --> 17:01.545
but, uh, I don't need that much
horsepower to make me happy.

17:03.048 --> 17:05.983
It's a CPAP machine. I have sleep apnea.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.586
That's why I was
trying to leave last night.

17:08.587 --> 17:10.121
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

17:10.122 --> 17:12.123
You can easily make one of these

17:12.124 --> 17:13.457
with a magazine and a fan,

17:13.458 --> 17:14.825
but you really can't.

17:16.595 --> 17:19.163
Why didn't you just
bring it over last night?

17:19.164 --> 17:21.699
Because I didn't want you looking at me

17:21.700 --> 17:26.170
like I was somebody waiting
to get their organs harvested.

17:26.171 --> 17:29.473
Dan, you're being ridiculous.

17:29.474 --> 17:31.942
No, I'm not.

17:31.943 --> 17:33.577
You're perfect.

17:33.578 --> 17:36.013
And I got all kinds of
stuff wrong with me.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.815
Well, I'm a little upset

17:37.816 --> 17:39.083
that you didn't trust me enough

17:39.084 --> 17:42.119
to tell me about
your sleep machine sooner.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.021
If you're gonna keep things from me,

17:44.022 --> 17:47.024
then we're building our
new relationship on lies.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.325
I got to tell ya,

17:48.326 --> 17:50.895
I feel like you're catfishing me.

17:52.631 --> 17:54.632
Just because I'm perfect...

17:56.101 --> 17:57.835
...doesn't mean
that you should be insecure

17:57.836 --> 17:59.870
about your stuff.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.705
I know you're trying to prove a point,

18:01.706 --> 18:04.108
but I got to tell ya, you're still hot.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.445
I'm not near done.

18:10.148 --> 18:12.983
Still sexy now, sailor?

18:16.087 --> 18:17.888
Still hot in my book.

18:20.225 --> 18:23.861
Look, we should not be
ashamed of getting older.

18:23.862 --> 18:26.163
We've earned the right to fall apart.

18:26.164 --> 18:29.233
And the nice thing is,
we can do it together.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.702
Yeah, funny thing is...

18:31.703 --> 18:33.070
until I look at myself in the mirror,

18:33.071 --> 18:34.438
I don't feel old.

18:34.439 --> 18:36.474
Hmm. Me neither.

18:36.475 --> 18:39.376
And you... you have the eyebrows

18:39.377 --> 18:41.979
of a 30-year-old man.

18:43.648 --> 18:46.584
I toned it down, but you still noticed.

18:46.585 --> 18:49.019
I'm told it makes my eyes pop.

18:50.055 --> 18:52.356
Aww. They do.

18:58.129 --> 19:00.064
It's about time you got here.

19:00.065 --> 19:01.866
We got to go to work.

19:01.867 --> 19:05.636
Well, well, well.

19:05.637 --> 19:08.105
Look who's rollin' in
first thing in the morning

19:08.106 --> 19:11.041
wearing the same clothes
he was wearing yesterday.

19:12.110 --> 19:15.646
And the same clothes
I was wearing the day before.

19:16.748 --> 19:20.251
We know what the walk of shame
looks like, Dad.

19:20.252 --> 19:22.052
You got your panties balled up

19:22.053 --> 19:24.321
in your purse here, don't you?

19:25.257 --> 19:27.224
I bet you got your bra on inside out.

19:28.260 --> 19:29.860
I just wanted to be part of it.

19:32.464 --> 19:35.332
Uh, you're gonna tell me
about last night, right?

19:39.771 --> 19:41.071
What's wrong?

19:41.072 --> 19:43.307
It's from the bank.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.142
They're foreclosing on the house.

19:47.646 --> 19:49.780
Y... You're joking, right?

19:49.781 --> 19:52.850
You know how slow business has been.

19:52.851 --> 19:54.285
I have medical bills,

19:54.286 --> 19:56.153
I need a new transmission for the truck,

19:56.154 --> 19:58.389
so I had to take out a second mortgage.

19:58.390 --> 20:00.824
I-I just can't keep up.

20:02.294 --> 20:03.327
Damn.

20:03.328 --> 20:04.795
I'm sorry, man.

20:04.796 --> 20:06.330
If they think
they're gonna take my house,

20:06.331 --> 20:08.332
they got another think coming.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.434
What are you gonna do?

20:10.435 --> 20:11.802
I don't know.

20:11.803 --> 20:13.337
But I should start
by getting me a rifle.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.306
We got the rev'nooers a-comin'.

20:21.462 --> 20:23.630
Hey there, Count Suckula.

20:24.632 --> 20:27.267
Uh, okay, so, your mom
and I have been talking

20:27.268 --> 20:29.469
about my role with you kids,

20:29.470 --> 20:32.238
and, uh, since you're almost a teenager,

20:32.239 --> 20:36.409
she asked me to talk to you about, um...

20:36.410 --> 20:38.812
well, the intimate things that, uh...

20:38.813 --> 20:42.882
happen between two people
who love each other.

20:44.985 --> 20:47.854
So here goes.

20:47.855 --> 20:50.557
You've been to the zoo, right?

20:51.692 --> 20:55.662
Sometimes, uh,
when you look in the cage...

20:58.432 --> 20:59.499
You can stop.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.368
My mom and I already had this talk.

21:02.369 --> 21:05.138
She just wanted me to see
how uncomfortable I could make you.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.406
Mm-hmm.

21:08.175 --> 21:10.677
You did a good job.

21:11.912 --> 21:13.847
You really had me sweating there.

21:13.848 --> 21:15.048
Thanks.

21:15.049 --> 21:17.316
So, how are you gonna get back at her?

21:17.318 --> 21:18.685
Oh, no, no.

21:18.686 --> 21:22.121
That's not the way things work
in a mature relationship.

21:23.557 --> 21:26.959
And I'll let you know
when I think of something good.
