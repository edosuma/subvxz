00:09.790 --> 00:13.620
Eighty years ago,
on a stormy Halloween night,

00:13.620 --> 00:18.000
a lonely girl
named Eliza Crane
was playing on the roof

00:18.000 --> 00:19.960
of our apartment building,

00:19.960 --> 00:22.620
when she was struck
by lightning!

00:22.620 --> 00:26.960
Now, every Halloween
her spirit returns,

00:26.960 --> 00:30.000
haunting all who live there.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.790
(laughing)
That is the fakest ghost story
I've ever heard!

00:34.790 --> 00:39.250
The only thing your building's
haunted by is your farts.

00:39.250 --> 00:41.250
That's just crass.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.920
Look, Travis,
you don't know everything
about ghosts.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.500
Yes, I do.
My dad's a ghost hunter.

00:48.500 --> 00:49.330
He hunts ghosts.

00:49.330 --> 00:52.290
No, your dad's a dentist.
He hunts cavities.

00:52.290 --> 00:54.580
Students:
Whoaaaaaa...

00:54.580 --> 00:56.420
Oh, come on, don't listen
to him.

00:56.420 --> 01:00.290
Booker's just making up
a ridiculous story
to get attention.

01:00.290 --> 01:02.000
Students:
Oooooh.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.500
No, I-- I'm serious,
it's true.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.710
I got it
from a very reliable source.

01:06.710 --> 01:08.460
You know what,
if you don't believe me,

01:08.460 --> 01:10.710
why don't you come over
and check it out yourself?

01:10.710 --> 01:12.380
Unless you're too scared.

01:12.380 --> 01:14.670
Ooooooh--

01:14.670 --> 01:16.420
We're not--
We're not doin' that no more?

01:18.460 --> 01:21.500
Fine!
Maybe I will, Booker.

01:21.500 --> 01:25.000
And I'll bring some
of my dad's ghost hunting
equipment, heh!

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Hope you're ready
to look like a fool.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.580
-Tss!
-I was born ready!

01:29.580 --> 01:35.250
Wait! You told Travis
you were born ready
to look like a fool?

01:35.250 --> 01:38.420
Well-- Well, it didn't
sound like that
when I said it.

01:38.420 --> 01:40.540
Yes, it did.

01:40.540 --> 01:44.500
Well, when Travis sees
that the ghost girl
you told me about

01:44.500 --> 01:46.750
is real, he's gonna
look like an idiot.

01:46.750 --> 01:49.380
Someone's gonna,
'cause I made that up.

01:50.580 --> 01:53.170
What?
Why would you mess
with us like that?

01:53.170 --> 01:54.920
It's how I show love.

01:54.920 --> 01:58.250
When I stop messing with you,
that's when you should worry.

(laughing)

02:53.080 --> 02:55.120
Tess!
This is bad!

02:55.120 --> 02:58.290
Travis is coming over
because I said there's a ghost
in our building.

02:58.290 --> 03:00.460
But there's no ghost!

03:00.460 --> 03:01.580
You have to help me!

03:01.580 --> 03:02.880
I wish I could, B,

03:02.880 --> 03:04.880
but I'm hangin'
with Nia tonight.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.000
Poor girl has chicken pox
on Halloween.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.790
There's nothing worse
than that.

03:08.790 --> 03:11.460
Hah-- Well, except
for your thing.

03:13.540 --> 03:15.830
Great. Travis is never

03:15.830 --> 03:18.500
gonna let me live this down.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.880
He's gonna have the whole school
laughin' at me.

03:20.880 --> 03:24.830
Yeah.
Maybe we should start
walkin' to school separately.

03:29.830 --> 03:33.170
(gasps) Ghost!
Stay away from me!

03:33.170 --> 03:34.500
Help!

03:37.710 --> 03:39.540
That was weird.

03:39.540 --> 03:43.500
I just saw Travis getting scared
by a ghost.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.120
But our building
isn't really haunted.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.710
Well, it is Halloween.

03:46.710 --> 03:49.670
Maybe he saw someone
dressed up like a ghost.

03:49.670 --> 03:53.080
That's it!
One of us can dress up
like the ghost girl

03:53.080 --> 03:54.460
and scare Travis!

03:54.460 --> 03:55.500
Which one of us?

03:55.500 --> 03:57.000
We'll figure it out.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.330
You.

03:59.710 --> 04:03.330
Happy Halloween!

04:03.330 --> 04:06.580
(pirate voice) Argh!
Where be your candy?

04:07.710 --> 04:09.500
Are you gonna talk like that
all night?

04:09.500 --> 04:10.790
(pirate voice)
I was thinkin' about it,

04:10.790 --> 04:15.120
but then I realized
(normal voice) my throat
hurt so bad.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.120
(clears throat)
Why aren't you guys
dressed up?

04:17.120 --> 04:18.960
It's Halloween, it's time
to go trick-or-treating!

04:18.960 --> 04:21.210
-Yeah!
-Sorry. We can't go.

04:21.210 --> 04:22.880
What? Honey, it's our
first Halloween

04:22.880 --> 04:24.620
since we moved in together.

04:24.620 --> 04:25.790
Yeah, but we already have plans.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.170
No, no,
you don't have plans.

04:27.170 --> 04:28.330
You have an idea.

04:28.330 --> 04:30.790
It's not a plan
till you ask me.

04:30.790 --> 04:33.620
But Mom, we have this jerky kid
from school comin' over

04:33.620 --> 04:36.380
so we can trick him
into thinking our building
is haunted.

04:36.380 --> 04:39.380
A Halloween prank?
I love Halloween pranks!

04:39.380 --> 04:40.620
(Raven and Chelsea screaming)

04:40.620 --> 04:43.750
Okay, who we are prankin'
and how are gettin' him?

04:43.750 --> 04:45.040
-Mom.
-Hm?

04:45.040 --> 04:48.040
I'm in sixth grade now.
I'm practically a man.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.830
And a man pulls
his own pranks.

04:50.830 --> 04:53.250
Come on, Levi, let's go
put you in a dress.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.670
Levi in a dress?
That's a good prank.

04:56.670 --> 04:58.540
Yeah. Cute.

04:58.540 --> 05:01.380
Bye, Mom.
Great badger costume,
by the way.

05:03.460 --> 05:06.460
Can you believe
Levi thought I was a badger?

05:06.460 --> 05:10.830
I mean, come on,
I'm a sloth.

05:10.830 --> 05:13.710
Isn't a sloth
just a slow badger?

05:13.710 --> 05:14.670
Yes.

05:20.750 --> 05:21.830
Ugh...

05:24.380 --> 05:26.920
-Hey, it's me.
-No! No, you can't
come in here!

05:26.920 --> 05:28.620
You're gonna catch
my chicken pox!

05:28.620 --> 05:32.540
Chill, I already had 'em
when I was five and nine
and ten.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.920
You can only get them once.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.000
Really?
Then what'd I have
the other two times?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.710
Apparently,
an unidentified rash.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.960
I can't believe
it's Halloween and I'm stuck

05:41.960 --> 05:43.380
in here wearing socks
on my hands

05:43.380 --> 05:44.670
so I don't scratch.

05:44.670 --> 05:47.250
Hey, it's cool.
I'll stay and not scratch
with you.

05:47.250 --> 05:50.750
You know, of course
I don't itch, so it'll
be easier for me.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.290
No, no, you can't
miss Halloween.

05:53.290 --> 05:54.790
It's the best!

05:54.790 --> 05:57.170
You don't wanna be stuck
in here with Dr. Pox-N-Socks.

05:58.210 --> 06:00.830
No.
Wouldn't be any fun
without my girl

06:00.830 --> 06:02.580
to go trick-or-treating with.

06:02.580 --> 06:03.750
Thanks, Tess.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.500
I'm gonna go take
an oatmeal bath.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.880
It's supposed to help
with the itching.

06:06.880 --> 06:07.830
Take some brown sugar.

06:07.830 --> 06:09.040
Does that help
with the itching?

06:09.040 --> 06:11.120
Nah, but it'll help
your bath taste better!

06:18.670 --> 06:21.790
Come on, Levi!
Nobody's even up here,

06:21.790 --> 06:23.210
just come out!

06:27.670 --> 06:30.290
Are you sure it's lightning
that killed Eliza Crane,

06:30.290 --> 06:34.330
or she just die
from looking ridiculous?

06:34.330 --> 06:35.330
Come on.

06:37.380 --> 06:39.920
You hide in there,
and when I say,

06:39.920 --> 06:43.460
"Eliza Crane,
show yourself,"

06:43.460 --> 06:45.500
you jump out,
and this'll happen.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.170
(thunder cracks)

06:48.170 --> 06:49.580
Pretty cool, huh?

06:49.580 --> 06:51.670
Whatever,
let's just get this over with

06:51.670 --> 06:53.710
before my curls drop.

06:58.540 --> 06:59.710
(chuckling)

07:07.460 --> 07:10.880
Aw, man,
my gumdrops melted.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.000
(creaking sound)

07:13.000 --> 07:14.670
What was that?

07:14.670 --> 07:16.170
Aah!

07:23.420 --> 07:26.080
All right, Chels,
I gave Nia all the oatmeal
we had for her bath.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.290
I hope that's enough.

07:27.290 --> 07:29.710
Oh, I think we still
have some grits in the pantry.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.790
It's an anti-itch bath, Chels.
Not a gospel brunch.

07:32.790 --> 07:34.000
(doorbell rings)

07:34.000 --> 07:36.170
Ooh, it's our first
trick-or-treaters
of the night!

07:36.170 --> 07:39.000
(laughs)
Remember, Chels, start
with the candy we don't want.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.960
Raven/Chelsea:
Happy Halloween!

07:45.960 --> 07:49.750
My dad's a dentist,
and he says sugar is bad
for your teeth.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.380
And for the record,
sloths don't have enough
muscle strength

07:52.380 --> 07:53.620
to stand on two legs.

07:53.620 --> 07:55.460
Oh, I think the words
you're looking for, honey,

07:55.460 --> 07:57.880
are "trick-or-treat"
and "thank you."

07:59.750 --> 08:01.580
Why, hello, Travis.

08:01.580 --> 08:02.670
Booker.

08:02.670 --> 08:04.170
Ohhh...

08:04.170 --> 08:05.920
this is the kid
you don't like

08:05.920 --> 08:07.330
but you're still
hangin' out with.

08:07.330 --> 08:08.790
Booker/Travis:
Yep.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.080
I don't like that kid.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.830
Rae... he's your son.

08:20.290 --> 08:24.120
Booker, my dad and I
have a list of every
haunted building in Chicago,

08:24.120 --> 08:25.960
and this isn't one of 'em.

08:25.960 --> 08:29.210
Sshh!
You need to be extremely quiet.

08:29.210 --> 08:32.710
-Why?
-Because I hate
the sound of your voice.

08:33.830 --> 08:36.000
(gasps)

08:36.000 --> 08:37.250
Did you feel that?

08:37.250 --> 08:39.830
I think a spirit is nearby.

08:39.830 --> 08:43.380
Eliza Crane,
show yourself!

08:43.380 --> 08:45.960
(thunder cracks)

08:48.330 --> 08:49.920
Eliza?

08:50.960 --> 08:53.830
Where's your ghost, Booker?

08:53.830 --> 08:55.960
Just one second.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.170
Eliza?

08:57.170 --> 08:58.620
(laughs)

08:58.620 --> 08:59.880
Levi!

08:59.880 --> 09:01.120
Levi?

09:01.120 --> 09:04.330
Um, why are you askin'
for Levi?

09:04.330 --> 09:07.000
I thought we were waitin'
on the ghost girl.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.880
Admit it, Booker,
you made this whole thing up.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.830
No, I didn't, Tess did.

09:11.830 --> 09:14.000
Ha!
Ha ha ha!

09:14.000 --> 09:16.960
I knew this was a fake story.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.120
Wait, were you guys
gonna pull some sort
of trick on me?

09:19.120 --> 09:21.790
Yeah, but only
because you are the worst.

09:23.580 --> 09:25.380
Levi:
Booker!
Help me!

09:25.380 --> 09:26.580
Levi!

09:27.580 --> 09:29.960
Levi, where--

09:29.960 --> 09:30.920
Where are you?

09:30.920 --> 09:34.170
Levi: I don't know.
It's really dark in here.

09:34.170 --> 09:35.880
Did you hear that?

09:35.880 --> 09:39.040
Whoa,
my spectrometer
is going nuts.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.460
(beeping noise)

09:40.460 --> 09:42.000
Wh-- What's that?

09:43.330 --> 09:45.880
Ew, it looks like
alien snot.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.920
There's no such thing
as aliens.

09:48.920 --> 09:53.540
This is ectoplasmic
portal goo.

09:54.830 --> 09:56.880
I'm glad it's not alien snot.

09:57.920 --> 10:00.080
Levi:
Hurry up, I'm scared.

10:00.080 --> 10:03.620
Booker,
I-- I think a dimensional
doorway opened.

10:03.620 --> 10:05.920
Levi must be trapped
in the spirit realm.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.080
Is that possible?

10:07.080 --> 10:08.960
Levi:
Help!

10:08.960 --> 10:11.790
Don't worry, Levi.
We'll get you back!

10:11.790 --> 10:15.040
And if you see
my dead goldfish,
tell him I'm sorry.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.500
I was just tryin'
to pet him.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.380
So!
You like it?

10:28.380 --> 10:31.120
This is amazing!

10:31.120 --> 10:32.830
-You did this?
-Yeah.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.750
I figured since you couldn't
go to Halloween,

10:34.750 --> 10:36.290
I'd bring Halloween to you!

10:36.290 --> 10:40.790
And girl, lemme tell you,
Halloween is heavier
than it looks!

10:40.790 --> 10:42.620
Where did you
get all of this stuff?

10:42.620 --> 10:45.670
The less you know
about how it went down,
the better.

10:45.670 --> 10:49.040
This is crazy.
It's like I'm outside
but inside.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.330
Oh, this is nothin'.
This is just phase one.

10:52.330 --> 10:53.670
Get your costume on.

10:53.670 --> 10:56.080
I've been sick all week.
I never got one.

10:59.670 --> 11:01.500
Why are you
looking at me like that?

11:01.500 --> 11:03.120
I think I have an idea.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.380
It's scary
that your idea face
and your crazy face

11:05.380 --> 11:06.710
are the same face.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.420
What are you doing?

11:09.420 --> 11:10.620
Do you trust me?

11:10.620 --> 11:12.880
Doesn't matter.
This is gonna be cool.

11:17.580 --> 11:19.830
Mom, I'm so glad
you're here.

11:19.830 --> 11:21.710
I need your help.
Levi's missing!

11:21.710 --> 11:24.540
-Levi's missing?
-Yeah, we were on the roof
trying to scare Travis,

11:24.540 --> 11:27.880
and I accidentally sent Levi
to an alternate dimension!

11:27.880 --> 11:29.420
We're kinda freaked out
about it.

11:29.420 --> 11:31.290
Levi's missing--

11:31.290 --> 11:34.040
(playing along)
Lev-- Levi-- Le--
Levi's missing!

11:34.040 --> 11:36.540
(gasps)
Oh, Levi's missing!

11:37.880 --> 11:39.170
(whispering)
Why are you saying it
like that?

11:39.170 --> 11:41.000
Because I'm gonna help you.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.920
(high-pitched voice)
Aaaaaaah...

11:42.920 --> 11:45.670
According to my dad's
Anthology of the Paranormal,

11:45.670 --> 11:47.080
if we're gonna
get Levi back,

11:47.080 --> 11:49.170
we need to contact him
in the spirit realm.

11:49.170 --> 11:53.210
(exaggerated gasp)
The spirit realm!

11:53.210 --> 11:57.040
Ooh, I need to get
my spirit scarf
for that! Aaah!

12:02.540 --> 12:06.460
Levi, we mortals
from the earthly plane

12:06.460 --> 12:09.380
invite you back
to our realm!

12:09.380 --> 12:12.170
Travis?
That's not how you do it.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.170
You have to chant
to the ancestors.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.670
Watch.

12:18.670 --> 12:22.670
(clears throat)
Hey en en en en
ah maya.

12:22.670 --> 12:25.170
Hum na na naya me-yah.

12:25.170 --> 12:27.040
Hi en en na mah yeah.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.670
(chanting noises)

12:29.670 --> 12:30.790
Oh!

12:30.790 --> 12:33.460
-Mom?
-Huh!

12:33.460 --> 12:35.000
-Mom, are you okay?
-Sshh!

12:35.000 --> 12:37.500
I ain't your mama!

12:37.500 --> 12:40.170
I'm a spirit
from the spirit realm.

12:40.170 --> 12:41.880
Have you seen Levi?

12:41.880 --> 12:47.250
Levi?
Is he-- Is he
about four feet tall,

12:47.250 --> 12:51.710
brown hair...
dressed like a girl?

12:51.710 --> 12:55.120
-Yeah, yeah, that's him--
-I've never seen him!

12:55.120 --> 12:56.170
Levi:
Can anyone hear me?

12:56.170 --> 12:57.830
Whoa, what was that?

12:59.420 --> 13:00.460
It's Levi.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.380
You for real?

13:02.380 --> 13:04.080
Levi:
Um, guys?

13:04.080 --> 13:06.380
Levi, where are you?

13:06.380 --> 13:08.920
I don't know.
I'm in this weird place.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.960
It's dark and creepy.

13:10.960 --> 13:14.250
I knew it.
He's in the spirit realm!

13:14.250 --> 13:16.120
Levi, what do you see?

13:16.120 --> 13:18.080
-Levi: Nothing.
-That's good.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.210
We're okay as long
as he doesn't see the light.

13:20.210 --> 13:21.620
Levi:
I see a light!

13:21.620 --> 13:23.710
Travis/Booker:
Nooooo!

13:23.710 --> 13:25.080
Levi:
I'm going toward it!

13:25.080 --> 13:29.000
Levi, not the light!
Stay away from the light!

13:29.000 --> 13:31.250
Levi:
I think there's somethin'
in here with me.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.790
It looks mean,
get me outta here!

13:32.790 --> 13:34.830
Levi, stay exactly
where you are,

13:34.830 --> 13:37.250
okay, sweetheart?
You, take me to the last place
that you saw him,

13:37.250 --> 13:39.580
and you, stay here
in case he comes back.

13:41.710 --> 13:44.170
-Come on.
-(gasps)
Is that alien snot?

13:44.170 --> 13:46.080
That's what I said!

13:47.460 --> 13:49.620
-Mom, we gotta focus. Okay?
-We're focusing!

13:49.620 --> 13:51.170
Watch out, watch out!

13:51.170 --> 13:53.080
What is this?
What is this?

13:53.080 --> 13:55.540
(gasps)
Ooh, it looks like
a maintenance door.

13:55.540 --> 13:57.290
I bet he went down there!

13:57.290 --> 13:59.620
Levi? Levi!

13:59.620 --> 14:01.080
Okay, listen, I'm gonna
go down.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.790
-If anything happens--
-Don't worry.

14:03.790 --> 14:05.830
I'll raise Nia
as if she was my own.

14:07.710 --> 14:09.210
No!

14:09.210 --> 14:11.420
If anything happens,
call for help!

14:11.420 --> 14:13.000
Oh, good.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.080
'Cause that girl
does not take me seriously
as an authority figure.

14:18.540 --> 14:21.120
Uuhh!

14:21.120 --> 14:23.380
Oh... ooh...

14:23.380 --> 14:24.500
Oh...

14:30.710 --> 14:32.500
-Hey, Mom.
-Aaah!

14:32.500 --> 14:34.170
What are you doing?

14:34.170 --> 14:35.710
Got scared up there.

14:35.710 --> 14:38.170
I thought it'd be
less scary down here.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.580
(whispers)
I was wrong.

14:43.710 --> 14:45.210
Are we in another
dimension?

14:45.210 --> 14:47.000
No, sweetheart,
we're just in the walls

14:47.000 --> 14:49.170
of our jinky old building.

14:49.170 --> 14:51.250
Booker?
Auntie Rae!

14:51.250 --> 14:53.330
Raven/Booker:
Levi!

14:53.330 --> 14:54.880
I'm so glad
we found you, buddy.

14:54.880 --> 14:58.920
I'm just happy you're safe.
Oooh, look at you,
you look pretty.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.290
Okay, we need to find a way
to get outta here.

15:02.290 --> 15:05.960
Be careful, Auntie Rae.
I think there's a monster
in here.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.170
Well, don't worry,
sweetheart, I'll protect you
from the monsters.

15:08.170 --> 15:09.960
Just stay close.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.420
Oh-- Okay, all right.
Okay, you gonna be that close?
All right, come on.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.250
(growling noise)

15:25.790 --> 15:27.040
There!

15:27.040 --> 15:29.170
So... what do you think?

15:31.210 --> 15:33.330
Oh my gosh, Tess, I love it!

15:33.330 --> 15:35.620
Yeah!
When I started connecting
your chicken pox,

15:35.620 --> 15:38.830
it was either gonna be
a skull face or a map
of Florida.

15:38.830 --> 15:40.880
I'm really glad
it went this way.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.290
-Time for phase two!
-Okay.

15:44.290 --> 15:45.830
Here's your
trick-or-treat bag!

15:45.830 --> 15:47.000
Well, there's a pillow in it.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.250
What, do I have
to do everything?

15:48.250 --> 15:49.920
Shake the pillow out!

15:52.250 --> 15:55.330
(eerie music playing)

15:55.330 --> 15:57.580
Give me a minute
and then knock.

16:02.290 --> 16:04.040
(knocking)

16:06.120 --> 16:08.710
(laughing)
Tess! What are you doing?

16:08.710 --> 16:11.120
I'm not Tess.
I'm a cranky old lady.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.540
Now what do you say?

16:12.540 --> 16:14.080
Uh, trick or treat, I guess?

16:14.080 --> 16:16.170
Aren't you a little old
to be trick-or-treating?

16:16.170 --> 16:17.500
-Wait, what?
-(door shutting)

16:19.290 --> 16:20.420
(knocking)

16:23.500 --> 16:24.290
Um...

16:25.620 --> 16:26.830
trick or treat?

16:26.830 --> 16:29.750
Well, aren't you
an adorable little skull face.

16:29.750 --> 16:32.460
Here's three pennies
and a toothbrush.

16:34.170 --> 16:35.420
What's happening?

16:35.420 --> 16:37.330
I'm giving you
the full Halloween experience.

16:38.420 --> 16:40.170
Oh-- Knock again.

16:41.830 --> 16:43.040
(knocking)

16:43.040 --> 16:44.330
Trick or treat!

16:45.460 --> 16:46.830
(knocking)

16:46.830 --> 16:48.040
Tess!

16:48.040 --> 16:49.210
(knocking)

16:51.380 --> 16:52.580
(laughs)

16:52.580 --> 16:54.500
Didn't you see
my light was off?

16:54.500 --> 16:56.120
I'm not doing Halloween
this year.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.880
Now get off my lawn
before I turn my hose
on ya!

16:58.880 --> 17:00.920
-But you said--
-I said get!

17:00.920 --> 17:05.580
-(Tess laughing)
-(Nia screaming)

17:05.580 --> 17:07.170
Now you gotta trick me.

17:07.170 --> 17:09.580
It's okay,
I totally deserve it.

17:16.710 --> 17:20.000
Travis?
What are you doin' here,
where is everybody?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.920
Levi disappeared
into an alternate dimension

17:21.920 --> 17:24.080
and then Booker and Mrs. Baxter
went to go find him,

17:24.080 --> 17:26.460
but they never came back
because the building's haunted!

17:26.460 --> 17:29.920
Haunted?
Oh. (laughs)

17:29.920 --> 17:31.420
No no no, Travis,
honey, listen.

17:31.420 --> 17:35.380
I think the boys are playin'
a little prank on ya.

17:35.380 --> 17:37.460
This isn't a prank.

17:37.460 --> 17:40.170
Those guys are not smart enough
to prank me.

17:40.170 --> 17:43.420
Wow.
Sounds like somebody needs
to work on their manners.

17:43.420 --> 17:44.830
You wanna talk
about manners?

17:44.830 --> 17:46.620
I have been here
for over an hour,

17:46.620 --> 17:49.710
and no one's even
offered me a beverage.

17:49.710 --> 17:51.670
Gosh, I'm sorry,
can I get you something
to drink?

17:51.670 --> 17:53.580
How could I be thirsty
at a time like this?

17:53.580 --> 17:55.380
All right, listen,
we're gonna find Rae

17:55.380 --> 17:56.420
and the kids real quick,

17:56.420 --> 17:59.210
before I say somethin'
I'm gonna regret.

17:59.210 --> 18:03.540
Okay, but can you go first?
You're old, I have a future.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.960
Wow!
You really are the worst.

18:12.710 --> 18:14.710
Ooh, this is fun, right?

18:14.710 --> 18:17.290
Ooh, we're ghosts in the walls
of the apartment building.

18:17.290 --> 18:18.500
We should find
our next door neighbors

18:18.500 --> 18:22.380
and say, (ghost voice)
"Stop stealing
Raven's WiFi."

18:22.380 --> 18:23.880
(laughs)

18:23.880 --> 18:25.750
It's a monster!

18:25.750 --> 18:27.830
(growling noise)

18:27.830 --> 18:30.330
(screams)

18:35.710 --> 18:37.170
I think we lost him.

18:37.170 --> 18:38.580
(creaking noises)

18:38.580 --> 18:39.540
Did you hear that?

18:39.540 --> 18:41.920
-(floor collapsing)
-(all screaming)

18:41.920 --> 18:43.120
(hitting floor)

18:43.120 --> 18:44.750
-Aah!
-Oh! Are you guys okay?

18:44.750 --> 18:46.040
-Yeah!
-I'm good!

18:46.040 --> 18:47.080
-(creaking noises)
-Oh, no...

18:47.080 --> 18:49.880
-(floor collapsing)
-(all screaming)

18:49.880 --> 18:51.040
(hitting floor)

18:51.040 --> 18:53.120
Aah!
Nobody move!

18:53.120 --> 18:55.420
-(creaking noises)
-Seriously?

18:55.420 --> 18:58.500
-(all screaming)
-(hitting floor)

19:01.420 --> 19:04.500
(panting)

19:04.500 --> 19:07.290
Three floors?
Are you kidding me?

19:07.290 --> 19:09.670
I'd sue, but I'm behind
on my rent.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.880
Whoa.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.580
What is this place?

19:16.580 --> 19:20.540
It's the laundry room.
You would know that if you
washed your own drawers.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.750
Ew, Mom, I don't wanna
touch those things.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.080
Nia?

19:34.080 --> 19:36.880
Hey, Nia, stop scratching
and knock on the door.

19:36.880 --> 19:39.380
You're not mad, are you?

19:39.380 --> 19:40.460
Come on.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.210
I was just messing around.

19:44.460 --> 19:47.380
Let's just play again.
I'll be a nice neighbor,
I promise.

19:48.580 --> 19:50.580
(screams)

19:50.580 --> 19:51.620
(screaming)

19:51.620 --> 19:52.960
(laughs)

19:52.960 --> 19:56.040
Gotcha.
That's what you get
for coming between a girl...

19:56.040 --> 19:58.290
and her candy.

19:58.290 --> 20:01.670
You scared me so bad!

20:01.670 --> 20:03.620
Thanks for doing this
for me, Tess.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.540
It almost makes me glad
I got chicken pox.

20:05.540 --> 20:07.540
(giggling)
No doubt.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.670
You're my girl.
I couldn't leave
you hanging.

20:10.670 --> 20:11.620
You want some candy?

20:11.620 --> 20:13.830
Of course!

20:13.830 --> 20:15.120
Where'd you get all this?

20:15.120 --> 20:16.380
You've been with me
all night.

20:16.380 --> 20:18.500
I got a secret stash.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.000
This bag says "Booker"
on it.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.710
I didn't say
it was my secret stash.

20:21.710 --> 20:23.460
(giggles)

20:27.830 --> 20:30.580
Lady, you're wasting
your time.

20:30.580 --> 20:31.790
Your kid's not here.

20:31.790 --> 20:35.000
-He's crossed over.
-I know! I know!

20:35.000 --> 20:37.290
To another dimension!

20:37.290 --> 20:38.960
Listen, kid.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.380
They're not in the apartment,
they're not on the rooftop,

20:41.380 --> 20:43.170
so this is the only other place
they could be.

20:43.170 --> 20:44.500
Phhuh.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.040
(gasps)

20:50.960 --> 20:53.250
Ghosts!
Stay away from me!

20:53.250 --> 20:54.620
Help!

21:01.500 --> 21:03.830
I don't want you hangin' out
with that kid anymore.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.540
-Mom!
-What happened to you guys?

21:06.540 --> 21:08.540
Aunt Chelsea, it was crazy.

21:08.540 --> 21:10.580
-Levi got trapped
in the walls--
-What?

21:10.580 --> 21:13.210
-And we fell through the floor!
-And a monster chased us.

21:13.210 --> 21:15.540
A monster?
Rae, come on.

21:15.540 --> 21:16.710
Chels, I'm serious.

21:16.710 --> 21:19.790
I wouldn't have believed it
if I didn't see it
with my own eyes.

21:19.790 --> 21:24.710
-(growling)
-(screaming)

21:25.790 --> 21:27.120
Ohh! Oh, no!

21:27.120 --> 21:32.000
(screaming)

21:35.710 --> 21:37.670
Oouhh, come here!

21:37.670 --> 21:38.580
Rae, stop!

21:38.580 --> 21:42.080
It's not a monster,
it's just an opossum.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.290
(squeaking)

21:43.290 --> 21:45.380
Chelsea:
Look how cute it is.

21:45.380 --> 21:48.120
Oh. Oh, it likes my costume.

21:48.120 --> 21:50.380
Yeah? Yeah, thinks
I'm its mummy?

21:50.380 --> 21:51.580
Yeah, you think I'm your mummy?

21:51.580 --> 21:52.830
(hissing)

21:52.830 --> 21:55.710
Nope. No.
No, opossums are mean.
Opossums are mean!

21:55.710 --> 21:57.750
(all yelling)

22:01.330 --> 22:03.250
Well, it wasn't
what I expected,

22:03.250 --> 22:05.880
but I have to admit,
it's a pretty good
first Halloween together.

22:05.880 --> 22:08.290
Yeah.
I'm just glad you're
out of that wall.

22:08.290 --> 22:11.000
I'm just glad
I'm out of that dress.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.540
What, it was worth it.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.620
We totally owned Travis.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.290
My plan worked perfectly.

22:16.290 --> 22:19.210
Yeah, it really didn't.

22:28.750 --> 22:30.710
(thunder cracks)

22:33.750 --> 22:35.880
(thunder cracks)
