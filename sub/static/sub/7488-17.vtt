00:04.721 --> 00:09.449
Last day of school! I'm
officially on summer vacation!

00:09.450 --> 00:10.739
Woo!

00:10.740 --> 00:12.341
I'm so pumped for summer break.

00:12.342 --> 00:16.454
I'm gonna chill at the beach all day
and rock out all night. Woo-hoo!

00:16.455 --> 00:17.574
I'm pumped too.

00:17.575 --> 00:21.240
I'm gonna chill at the library all day
and teach myself calculus all night.

00:21.241 --> 00:23.276
Woo-hoo!

00:23.277 --> 00:25.998
I have to make a documentary
this summer for my film class.

00:25.999 --> 00:27.685
I just have to figure
out what it's about.

00:27.686 --> 00:29.846
Woo-hoo!

00:29.853 --> 00:32.317
Make it about me. Woo-hoo!

00:32.319 --> 00:35.199
Eh, I don't know.

00:35.218 --> 00:38.071
I'm sorry. I used
the wrong tone.

00:38.072 --> 00:41.552
Make it about me. Woo-hoo!

00:42.429 --> 00:44.808
Austin Moon and Ally Dawson!

00:44.809 --> 00:47.209
Shiny Money.

00:49.269 --> 00:53.337
Hey, we haven't seen you since we performed
together at the Internet Music Awards.

00:53.338 --> 00:58.444
That was so cool, up until your
friends broke my arms and legs.

00:58.445 --> 01:02.798
I'm surprised you remember the
whole us-not-catching-you thing.

01:02.799 --> 01:07.320
You hit your head pretty
hard on that stage.

01:07.321 --> 01:09.288
So, Shiny, what brings you here?

01:09.289 --> 01:12.693
Throwing my annual Swamp Blast party
in the Everglades this weekend.

01:12.694 --> 01:14.359
I want Austin to perform.

01:14.360 --> 01:18.007
Are you kidding? You want me to perform
at the Swamp Blast? That's huge.

01:18.008 --> 01:20.199
- We watch Swamp Blast on TV every year.
- Yeah.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.816
Yeah, this year it's
gonna be popping!

01:22.817 --> 01:27.317
Ooh, I should pop out
a bumping new jam.

01:28.342 --> 01:30.918
Or I could just
write a new song.

01:30.919 --> 01:32.378
You should come to
the houseboat early.

01:32.379 --> 01:35.214
You can write the song there
and get a little vacation too.

01:35.215 --> 01:38.871
And I'll let you use my
shiny solid-gold keyboard.

01:38.872 --> 01:43.190
Awesome! I've always wanted
to go to the Everglades.

01:43.191 --> 01:45.391
And play a shiny gold keyboard.

01:45.392 --> 01:48.327
And now the four of us can finally
have a vacation together!

01:48.328 --> 01:52.331
- You're not invited.
- Ha! In your face, Trish.

01:52.332 --> 01:57.732
- You're not invited either.
- Ha! In my face, Trish.

01:58.338 --> 02:00.790
But Dez and Trish are
a part of our team.

02:00.791 --> 02:04.610
Yeah, it would mean a lot for all of
us to spend our vacation together.

02:04.611 --> 02:06.109
Please let them come.

02:06.110 --> 02:08.270
Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.595
What did I just say?

02:15.596 --> 02:19.976
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:20.997 --> 02:24.099
<i>When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

02:24.100 --> 02:27.234
<i>'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

02:27.235 --> 02:28.766
<i>You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

02:28.767 --> 02:30.385
<i>You're the perfect chord.</i>

02:30.386 --> 02:33.430
<i>And I see our names together
on every billboard.</i>

02:33.431 --> 02:36.489
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock.</i>

02:36.490 --> 02:38.103
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

02:38.104 --> 02:40.426
<i>And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

02:40.427 --> 02:44.564
<i>Oh, there's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

02:44.565 --> 02:47.600
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

02:47.601 --> 02:50.670
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

02:50.671 --> 02:53.993
<i>With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

02:53.994 --> 02:56.643
<i>I own this dream.</i>

02:56.644 --> 03:00.021
<i>'Cause I got you with me.</i>

03:00.022 --> 03:03.139
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:03.140 --> 03:07.460
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:13.551 --> 03:18.322
A group of friends went on vacation,
hoping to have the time of their lives.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.432
How do you feel, Austin?

03:20.433 --> 03:25.562
This place is awesome! I feel like the
weight of the world is off my shoulders.

03:25.563 --> 03:30.334
Yeah, that's because we're
carrying all the bags.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.014
Woo.

03:32.015 --> 03:35.745
I know your dad wanted to get a head start
on fishing, but he could've dropped us off

03:35.746 --> 03:38.325
- a little closer to the boat.
- Mmm.

03:38.326 --> 03:40.885
Now are we sure this
is Shiny Money's boat?

03:40.886 --> 03:43.070
There's a giant dollar
sign on the door

03:43.071 --> 03:47.339
and the name of the boat
is "Shiny Money's boat."

03:47.340 --> 03:51.377
I'm pretty sure we're
at the right place.

03:51.378 --> 03:54.346
Whoa! This place is amazing!

03:54.347 --> 03:56.584
It's so...

03:56.585 --> 03:58.365
Gold.

03:58.366 --> 04:01.653
Yeah, I can already feel my
creative juices flowing.

04:01.654 --> 04:03.278
I'm pretty sure that's sweat.

04:03.279 --> 04:09.179
We just walked a mile through the swamp
and this weather is not good for my hair.

04:10.363 --> 04:14.973
Check out all this gold. A solid-gold
keyboard, a solid-gold lamp...

04:14.974 --> 04:18.094
A solid-gold goldfish.

04:18.438 --> 04:22.274
So now that we're on vacation,
what are we gonna do first?

04:22.275 --> 04:23.609
What can we do?

04:23.610 --> 04:27.746
I didn't know the Everglades was all swamp.
I haven't seen a single shopping mall.

04:27.747 --> 04:29.615
Ally and I need to get to work.

04:29.616 --> 04:33.419
The sooner we finish this song, the
sooner we get to start our vacay.

04:33.420 --> 04:35.651
Then we can partay.

04:35.652 --> 04:39.324
- Put away the calculator.
- Okay.

04:39.325 --> 04:40.853
Fine, we'll get out of your way.

04:40.854 --> 04:43.595
You guys do your thing
and we'll do our thing.

04:43.596 --> 04:45.093
- Perfect.
- Cool.

04:45.094 --> 04:47.433
I have a few ideas for the song.

04:47.434 --> 04:49.868
And so Austin and Ally
began working on a song,

04:49.869 --> 04:51.770
for Austin's big
televised performance.

04:51.771 --> 04:54.588
It's important they
not be disturbed.

04:54.589 --> 04:58.508
Funny you say that, because
you're totally disturbing us.

04:58.509 --> 05:01.380
I'm trying to find something exciting
to make my documentary about.

05:01.381 --> 05:03.049
You can still make it about me.

05:03.050 --> 05:05.243
Uh, I said "something exciting."

05:05.244 --> 05:09.455
You mean exciting like
throwing you off a boat?

05:09.456 --> 05:13.116
What do you think about this?

05:15.528 --> 05:19.331
That chord sounds a
lot like a blender.

05:19.332 --> 05:22.269
Trish, can you not
use the blender?

05:22.270 --> 05:25.145
- Sorry.
- Okay, where were we? Um...

05:25.146 --> 05:27.116
<i>Who wants toast?
Dez wants toast.</i>

05:27.117 --> 05:29.120
<i>Who wants toast?
Dez wants toast.</i>

05:29.121 --> 05:31.610
<i>- Dez wants toast, Dez wants toast!
- Dez!</i>

05:31.611 --> 05:34.513
- Can you go outside?
- Just until we finish the song.

05:34.514 --> 05:36.876
Okay, we'll leave.

05:36.877 --> 05:42.277
Come on, Dez. All they need
is some peace and quiet.

05:42.565 --> 05:44.365
Ah!

05:44.390 --> 05:47.201
Uh, is Shiny Money home? I'm
just returning these tools.

05:47.202 --> 05:51.272
Turns out a solid-gold
chainsaw don't cut too good.

05:51.273 --> 05:54.353
- You know Shiny Money?
- We're neighbors.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.369
Name's Clavis. You've got
a good scream there.

05:57.370 --> 06:00.851
It'll come in handy if you
ever run into Big Momma.

06:00.852 --> 06:02.574
Who is Big Momma?

06:02.575 --> 06:06.411
Only the meanest, baddest
alligator in the Everglades.

06:06.412 --> 06:10.474
Legends has it that she's
got bright fiery eyes...

06:10.475 --> 06:15.426
She can walk on two legs, and
jump clear over a house!

06:15.427 --> 06:18.849
Clavis, I know we just met,
but I find you fascinating.

06:18.850 --> 06:20.928
Tell me more.

06:20.929 --> 06:22.440
Dez, he can't stand there

06:22.441 --> 06:24.630
- and tell us stories all day.
- Thank you.

06:24.631 --> 06:27.622
He should sit on the couch
and tell us stories all day.

06:27.623 --> 06:30.669
Guys, we really need
to get to work.

06:30.670 --> 06:34.373
Oh, don't you worry, ma'am, I'll
tell the story real quick-like.

06:34.374 --> 06:38.744
The legend of Big Momma started
a long, long, long, long...

06:38.745 --> 06:42.765
Can you tell it
more quicker like?

06:46.553 --> 06:50.699
And the only thing they
found of old man Jones...

06:50.700 --> 06:53.700
Was this here tooth.

07:00.300 --> 07:03.540
Whoa, that's his tooth?

07:04.470 --> 07:07.110
Finders keepers.

07:08.341 --> 07:11.543
You know what? I'm gonna do
my documentary on Big Momma.

07:11.544 --> 07:14.739
Clavis, tell that really
really long story again.

07:14.740 --> 07:18.640
- This time I'll film it.
- No!

07:19.086 --> 07:21.353
Ally's right. We need to get
back to writing our song.

07:21.354 --> 07:24.287
Fine, then I'm gonna
go look for Big Momma.

07:24.288 --> 07:28.183
Well, good luck finding her, because
she's never been captured on film.

07:28.184 --> 07:34.084
Is it because she doesn't exist or is it
because she eats everyone holding a camera?

07:34.400 --> 07:38.900
Dez, let's go! Don't
forget your camera.

07:43.146 --> 07:47.226
Try this for the
end of the verse.

07:47.513 --> 07:49.455
<i>So good to get away...</i>

07:49.456 --> 07:53.318
<i>All day in the car,
but that's okay...</i>

07:53.319 --> 07:54.686
Big Momma!

07:54.687 --> 07:57.489
- She's here?
- And cut!

07:57.490 --> 08:00.189
Oh no, we're rehearsing
Trish's reaction.

08:00.190 --> 08:04.696
We want it to seem real when
she runs into Big Momma.

08:04.697 --> 08:06.945
You don't think she's
gonna scream for real,

08:06.946 --> 08:10.235
when she runs into a giant
man-eating alligator?

08:10.236 --> 08:13.082
Hey, you don't know. She might
just do a silent scream,

08:13.083 --> 08:17.017
like Ally does when
she sees a spider.

08:17.018 --> 08:21.098
Ally, calm down.
It's just a leaf.

08:22.715 --> 08:24.650
A leaf with a spider on it!

08:24.651 --> 08:26.251
A leaf with a spider on it!

08:26.252 --> 08:28.712
Oh! Get out!

08:28.825 --> 08:33.451
If you guys are done messing around,
we're gonna get back to work.

08:33.452 --> 08:36.595
Hey! We're the ones
who need to work.

08:36.596 --> 08:40.967
Shiny's Swamp Blast is tomorrow and we're
not even close to finishing the song.

08:40.969 --> 08:44.705
- Fine, we'll leave you alone.
- You won't even know we're here.

08:44.706 --> 08:46.638
I'm gonna go charge my
electric toothbrush.

08:46.639 --> 08:48.607
I'm gonna plug in my
hair straightener.

08:48.608 --> 08:52.477
You guys have too many things plugged in.
You're gonna cause a power outage. Look.

08:52.478 --> 08:54.763
There aren't too many
things plugged in.

08:54.764 --> 08:57.404
It'll be fine.

09:01.034 --> 09:02.947
I guess it won't be fine.

09:02.948 --> 09:04.523
This is terrible.

09:04.524 --> 09:07.459
I know. Now my hair will
never get straight.

09:07.460 --> 09:09.394
No, the keyboard's fried.

09:09.395 --> 09:14.071
Now we can't write our song and I have
to perform on television tomorrow night.

09:14.072 --> 09:17.819
Guys, I think we have
bigger problems.

09:17.820 --> 09:19.740
Look.

09:20.276 --> 09:22.556
Big Momma!

09:24.000 --> 09:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:35.155 --> 09:37.533
- Huh?
- Clavis?

09:37.534 --> 09:40.719
Uh, I'm just returning Shiny
Money's two red flashlights.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.304
Why were you growling?

09:43.305 --> 09:47.175
Well, because I
swallowed a mosquito.

09:47.176 --> 09:49.036
Mmm.

09:49.278 --> 09:52.221
By the way, the power's out.

09:52.222 --> 09:53.732
Thanks, Clavis.

09:53.733 --> 09:56.010
Y'all wanna hear a ghost story?

09:56.011 --> 09:59.170
- Legend has it...
- No!

09:59.171 --> 10:04.543
- It's a really quick story.
- We've heard it already.

10:04.544 --> 10:07.140
How are we supposed to finish
the song without the keyboard?

10:07.141 --> 10:10.376
Let's just get a good night's sleep and
we'll figure it out in the morning.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.751
Oh, it's too hot in here.

10:12.752 --> 10:14.586
That's because we have
no air conditioning

10:14.587 --> 10:17.622
because someone plugged too
many things into the outlet.

10:17.623 --> 10:22.543
Hey, let's go sleep outside.
It'll be cooler.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.637
I barely slept at
all last night.

10:25.638 --> 10:29.120
I was being eaten
alive by mosquitoes.

10:29.121 --> 10:32.321
Yeah, I barely got
any sleep either.

10:32.322 --> 10:35.041
I was up most of the night
watching out for Big Momma.

10:35.042 --> 10:39.244
I feel like the humidity made
my hair poof out even more.

10:39.245 --> 10:42.065
Does it look bad?

10:42.582 --> 10:44.382
No.

10:45.368 --> 10:49.868
Ah! That's the best
I've slept in ages.

10:51.657 --> 10:53.692
Oh, hey, look, my
dad left a note.

10:53.693 --> 10:56.862
"Left early in the
morning, be back tonight.

10:56.863 --> 11:00.763
P.S. What's with Trish's hair?"

11:00.897 --> 11:02.931
It's gorgeous...

11:02.932 --> 11:06.052
And not poofy at all.

11:06.606 --> 11:08.740
I'm gonna go search
for Big Momma.

11:08.741 --> 11:10.397
Wanna come with me, Trish?

11:10.398 --> 11:11.983
Why would I wanna come with you?

11:11.984 --> 11:14.532
Because we're friends
and I don't wanna go...

11:14.533 --> 11:16.399
Alone.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.723
Aw, you think we're friends.

11:19.724 --> 11:22.741
The price of friendship?
Twenty bucks.

11:22.742 --> 11:24.662
Deal!

11:26.631 --> 11:29.767
We gotta finish that song.
The Swamp Blast is tonight.

11:29.768 --> 11:33.618
How are we gonna write music
without any instruments?

11:33.619 --> 11:35.873
Maybe creepy Clavis has
something we can use.

11:35.874 --> 11:38.149
I'll call him. He gave
me his business card.

11:38.150 --> 11:40.544
- He has a business card?
- Mm-hmm.

11:40.545 --> 11:43.848
There's no number. All
it says is "yell."

11:43.849 --> 11:45.709
Hmm.

11:46.245 --> 11:47.751
Clavis!

11:47.752 --> 11:50.994
Can't talk right now. Leave
a message after the beep.

11:50.995 --> 11:52.915
Beep!

11:53.503 --> 11:58.696
We need your help! Yell back
when you get the chance.

11:58.697 --> 12:00.617
Beep.

12:04.870 --> 12:07.205
We've been walking
around for three hours

12:07.206 --> 12:10.073
looking for some creature
that doesn't exist!

12:10.074 --> 12:14.521
And if we're in this humidity any
longer, my hair will be bigger than me!

12:14.522 --> 12:16.680
Fine, let's stop here.

12:16.681 --> 12:20.142
<i>Huh. Wish I had something to drink.
I am... Thirsty!</i>

12:20.143 --> 12:23.323
Oh, I have some water.

12:33.832 --> 12:35.752
Phew.

12:38.441 --> 12:40.604
Here, hold this.

12:40.605 --> 12:42.405
Ah!

12:43.309 --> 12:46.443
I brought some
instruments for y'all.

12:46.444 --> 12:48.292
Awesome! A guitar!

12:48.293 --> 12:50.291
That's just what we need
to finish our song.

12:50.292 --> 12:54.132
Guitar? These are
blowing jugs...

12:54.886 --> 12:58.006
And a thumping bucket.

12:59.358 --> 13:02.320
Blowing jugs and a
thumping bucket?

13:02.321 --> 13:04.781
We're saved!

13:07.661 --> 13:10.040
As I continue my search
for Big Momma...

13:10.041 --> 13:15.941
I must note that no living soul
has ever captured her on film!

13:18.304 --> 13:21.368
Oh hey, there's Big Momma.

13:21.369 --> 13:25.142
She's bigger than I imagine
teeth the size of daggers.

13:25.143 --> 13:30.243
Oh wait, I'm zoomed in. Okay, hold on.
Hold on.

13:30.874 --> 13:33.042
That's a baby alligator, genius.

13:33.043 --> 13:35.143
Oh man!

13:35.795 --> 13:39.107
Let's head back to the boat so I can
get ready for Shiny Money's party.

13:39.108 --> 13:41.107
I hope I have time
to do my hair.

13:41.108 --> 13:47.008
Hey, you know the party's tonight
and not in six months, right?

13:53.787 --> 13:57.207
See you later, baby gator.

14:03.397 --> 14:05.589
<i>Na na na.</i>

14:05.590 --> 14:07.870
<i>Na na na.</i>

14:07.877 --> 14:10.151
<i>Na na na.</i>

14:10.152 --> 14:12.422
<i>Na na na.</i>

14:12.423 --> 14:14.703
<i>Na na na.</i>

14:14.709 --> 14:16.989
<i>Na na na.</i>

14:19.006 --> 14:20.516
That sounded great.

14:20.517 --> 14:23.917
We finally finished our song,
and Clavis fixed the power.

14:23.918 --> 14:25.920
Now we can enjoy our vacation.

14:25.921 --> 14:30.421
It's time to get this
partay star-tayed.

14:33.269 --> 14:37.169
That's right, Ally. Par-tay! Oh!

14:39.868 --> 14:41.968
There's an alligator behind you!

14:41.969 --> 14:44.283
Huh? Oh, that's just baby gator.

14:44.284 --> 14:48.255
He followed us home.
Can't figure out why.

14:48.256 --> 14:49.465
I smell rotting meat.

14:49.466 --> 14:52.947
Oh, that's the steak I pulled out
of the freezer when we lost power.

14:52.948 --> 14:56.488
I wanna keep my pants cool.

14:56.818 --> 14:59.887
That alligator's been following
you because of that steak.

14:59.888 --> 15:01.656
Hey, you don't know that.

15:01.657 --> 15:06.157
It could also be because
of this chicken.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.635
Uh, guys? Guys?

15:14.031 --> 15:16.311
Big Momma!

15:27.771 --> 15:29.927
Big Momma's never been
captured on film!

15:29.928 --> 15:32.688
Now's my chance.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.826
It's also our chance
to get eaten!

15:35.827 --> 15:38.189
Get out of the way!

15:38.190 --> 15:39.882
Keep going! Close the door!

15:39.883 --> 15:42.113
- Close the door!
- Close it, close it, close it!

15:42.114 --> 15:45.093
- Don't let it get us!
- We've gotta block the door!

15:45.094 --> 15:46.624
- Okay!
- Hold it, Ally!

15:46.625 --> 15:48.757
- The couch!
- Yeah, the couch, the couch!

15:48.758 --> 15:51.284
Come on! Come on!

15:51.285 --> 15:54.945
Get the couch! Get the couch!

15:57.135 --> 15:59.535
We're good.

16:01.281 --> 16:04.821
Dez, the window! The window!

16:07.844 --> 16:10.296
Why is Big Momma
attacking the boat?

16:10.297 --> 16:13.649
I know... Baby gator must
be Big Momma's baby.

16:13.650 --> 16:17.271
I knew you were trouble
the second I saw you!

16:17.272 --> 16:22.312
Oh, you are so cute. I
can't stay mad at you.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.172
We've gotta get
rid of Big Momma.

16:30.173 --> 16:32.662
I have an idea, but we need
to distract her first.

16:32.663 --> 16:35.217
I'm on it. Dez, come with me.

16:35.218 --> 16:39.148
Yep, Trish and Dez
back as a team.

16:39.149 --> 16:41.536
Here, Big Momma!
Here, Big Momma!

16:41.537 --> 16:46.937
She's coming right at me!
She's coming right at me!

16:47.190 --> 16:49.364
Come on, baby gator. Come on.

16:49.365 --> 16:51.260
Come on, baby gator. Come on.
Come, baby gator.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.598
Come on. Come on, baby gator.
There you go.

16:53.599 --> 16:55.657
Go go go go go go! Over here, baby gator.
Over here.

16:55.658 --> 16:57.553
Baby gator, go fast. Keep going.

16:57.554 --> 17:02.474
Keep going. Great! Pull that up!
Pull that up!

17:05.738 --> 17:07.746
I think it worked.

17:07.747 --> 17:09.582
How can we be sure she's gone?

17:09.583 --> 17:10.849
Someone look out the window.

17:10.851 --> 17:13.385
No way. That thing
can jump in windows.

17:13.386 --> 17:16.266
I've got an idea.

17:18.724 --> 17:24.605
- Nope, she's not over there.
- Maybe she's under the boat?

17:25.461 --> 17:27.665
Nope, not under here. Uh-oh!

17:27.666 --> 17:29.887
Dez! Dez!

17:30.804 --> 17:34.404
There's a leak in the boat!

17:37.178 --> 17:38.878
Hello?

17:38.879 --> 17:42.648
Oh, hi, Shiny Money. We're
having a great time.

17:42.649 --> 17:45.910
This is the best vacation ever.
Your boat's amazing!

17:45.911 --> 17:49.522
- The boat's sinking!
- No, not sinking.

17:49.523 --> 17:53.844
This boat's stinking...
Stinking awesome.

17:53.845 --> 17:55.604
Gotta go. Bye.

17:55.605 --> 17:58.723
Quick! Find something
to plug the hole!

17:58.724 --> 18:01.784
Dez! Here, Dez, here.

18:06.451 --> 18:09.031
Oh! Go go go!

18:11.037 --> 18:15.717
- I think this is gonna work.
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:17.076 --> 18:18.977
That didn't work.

18:18.978 --> 18:21.258
Wha... Oh!

18:21.781 --> 18:25.633
My houseboat! What
happened to my houseboat?!

18:25.634 --> 18:28.020
There is a perfectly good
explanation as to why...

18:28.021 --> 18:30.639
- You two did this, didn't you?
- It wasn't their fault.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.063
- Big Momma did it.
- Don't lie to me.

18:33.064 --> 18:35.389
- Big Momma is a myth!
- Dez has proof!

18:35.390 --> 18:39.170
- Show him the footage.
- Yeah.

18:41.590 --> 18:43.931
All I see is y'all
messing up my houseboat!

18:43.932 --> 18:45.746
And some big hair!

18:45.747 --> 18:48.567
Oh man! I didn't get any
shots of Big Momma?

18:48.568 --> 18:53.538
Well, in your defense, she was only 20 feet
long and attacking us for half an hour!

18:53.539 --> 18:56.174
You guys are gonna pay for this!
I can't believe you!

18:56.175 --> 18:59.955
Hey, look... Baby gator's back.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.402
If he's back, that means...

19:03.403 --> 19:05.683
Big Momma!

19:06.686 --> 19:10.346
Go, Dez! Go go go go go go!

19:11.148 --> 19:12.865
Oh! Oh!

19:12.866 --> 19:15.760
Okay! I believe you!

19:15.761 --> 19:18.341
I believe you!

19:25.105 --> 19:27.604
It's party time, y'all! So
give it up for the only dude

19:27.605 --> 19:30.831
who brings down the house
before coming out on stage...

19:30.832 --> 19:33.232
Austin Moon!

19:38.551 --> 19:44.451
Hey, everybody! This song's about summer
vacation and having fun with your friends.

19:52.465 --> 19:57.004
<i>Summer love hanging in the air. Hot
sand on my feet, but I don't care.</i>

19:57.005 --> 20:01.815
<i>It's all I ever wanted
I hope it never ends.</i>

20:01.816 --> 20:06.544
<i>So good to get away all day
in the car, but that's okay.</i>

20:06.545 --> 20:10.649
<i>Because I like like like it like that.
Just chilling with my friends.</i>

20:10.650 --> 20:15.115
<i>Because I... Love a
summertime vacation song...</i>

20:15.116 --> 20:19.824
<i>And you know wherever we go,
you'll be singing along.</i>

20:19.825 --> 20:22.229
<i>Like na na na...</i>

20:22.230 --> 20:24.570
<i>Na na na...</i>

20:24.571 --> 20:26.922
<i>Na na na...</i>

20:26.923 --> 20:29.323
<i>Na na na...</i>

20:30.178 --> 20:32.570
<i>It's such a crazy journey,</i>

20:32.571 --> 20:34.672
<i>but I'm not in any hurry.</i>

20:34.673 --> 20:39.364
<i>I'm taking my time.</i>

20:39.365 --> 20:43.936
<i>It's all I ever wanted, to
not know where we're going.</i>

20:43.937 --> 20:46.757
<i>Enjoying the ride.</i>

20:46.758 --> 20:49.158
<i>Yeah yeah...</i>

20:56.546 --> 21:01.287
<i>Because I... Love a
summertime vacation song...</i>

21:01.288 --> 21:05.820
<i>And you know wherever we go,
you'll be singing along.</i>

21:05.821 --> 21:08.338
<i>Like na na na...</i>

21:08.339 --> 21:10.571
<i>Na na na...</i>

21:10.572 --> 21:12.880
<i>Na na na...</i>

21:12.881 --> 21:15.161
<i>Na na na.</i>

21:25.891 --> 21:29.461
You know, our vacation
didn't start out so great.

21:29.462 --> 21:31.763
But it turned out to be the
best one I've ever had.

21:31.764 --> 21:35.424
Yeah, we sunk a boat.
We fought an alligator.

21:35.425 --> 21:37.602
Dez made toast.

21:37.603 --> 21:39.721
That was some good toast.

21:39.722 --> 21:41.806
Thanks, buddy.

21:41.807 --> 21:44.348
And you got to perform on TV.

21:44.349 --> 21:46.001
It was awesome.

21:46.002 --> 21:48.780
Who knew you could have so
much fun without a calculator?

21:48.781 --> 21:50.076
- I did.
- Me too.

21:50.077 --> 21:51.816
Duh.

21:51.817 --> 21:54.273
The only bummer is Dez didn't
get to finish his movie.

21:54.274 --> 21:56.357
Actually, I did.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.626
You finished your
documentary about Big Momma

21:58.627 --> 22:00.528
without getting any
shots of Big Momma?

22:00.529 --> 22:03.498
I just used all the footage and
turned it into a horror movie.

22:03.499 --> 22:06.019
Check it out.

22:14.276 --> 22:19.213
A group of friends went on vacation,
hoping to have the time of their lives.

22:19.214 --> 22:22.334
Then things got hairy.

22:23.319 --> 22:28.419
Doctor Dez's... "Houseboat
of Terror" Coming soon.

22:30.326 --> 22:34.228
You made a monster
movie about me?!

22:34.229 --> 22:36.569
I love it!

22:38.338 --> 22:41.158
Now that's scary.

22:42.204 --> 22:44.004
Ah!
