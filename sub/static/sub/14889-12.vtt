Cousin, hi.

01:26.753 --> 01:30.524
I just hear the greatest joke
at night school.

01:30.557 --> 01:32.726
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Let me decompose myself.

01:36.329 --> 01:38.799
Okay, listen to this.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.235
I just drove in from LA

01:42.268 --> 01:45.506
and, boy, are my arms tired.

01:48.575 --> 01:49.876
No, no, no. I didn’t tell
that right. Wait a minute.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.849
Balki, uh, I’d love to hear
a joke but I’m kinda busy.

01:55.882 --> 01:59.319
Oh, cousin.
What? What you’re doing?

01:59.352 --> 02:00.787
Well, I’m making my selections

02:00.821 --> 02:02.856
for the football pool at work.

02:02.889 --> 02:04.925
‐Football pool?
‐A football pool.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.828
Well, feed me garlic
and call me stinky.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.566
I didn’t even know
they had a pool at work

02:12.599 --> 02:15.268
let alone one large enough
to play football in.

02:16.703 --> 02:20.340
Balki, a football pool
is like a lottery.

02:20.373 --> 02:21.808
For a dollar,
you pick the teams

02:21.842 --> 02:23.343
you think you’re gonna
win on Sunday.

02:23.376 --> 02:25.879
And whoever picks
the most winners, wins.

02:28.615 --> 02:30.517
What does the winner who picks
the most winners

02:30.551 --> 02:31.885
wind up winning?

02:33.319 --> 02:35.522
Well, usually around $65.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.457
Get out of the city!

02:39.392 --> 02:41.628
Sixty five dollars?
I want to play.

02:45.365 --> 02:46.900
‐What do I do next?
‐Well...

02:46.933 --> 02:49.736
Just circle all the teams
you think are gonna win.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.438
Uh, Balki, keep in mind

02:52.472 --> 02:56.309
picking winning football teams
is very complicated.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.311
If you have any
questions at all...

02:58.344 --> 03:00.280

that wasn’t it, that wasn’t it.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.464

I got it.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.002

from Denver

03:22.035 --> 03:25.405

are my arms tired.

the football pool.

the football pool?

Balki won
the football pool?

How much did he win?

would have won $65

04:50.056 --> 04:51.658
I don’t know.

04:51.692 --> 04:54.728
It‐it must have been my‐my
sheepherder’s intuition.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.632
Sheepherder’s intuition?

04:58.665 --> 05:02.335
Yeah, cousin, now that I look
at it, it makes perfect sense.

05:02.368 --> 05:05.305
Obviously, a bronco
can beat a colt.

05:09.042 --> 05:12.513
And a‐a lion
could beat a Bengal.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.582
After all, the lion
is king of the jungle.

05:18.585 --> 05:21.054
And I took the bills
over the chargers

05:21.087 --> 05:24.124
because no matter
how much you keep charging

05:24.157 --> 05:26.927
sooner or later
you have to pay the bill.

05:31.064 --> 05:35.636
Well, Balki, that’s certainly
a cute little system

05:35.669 --> 05:38.371

you being lucky enough

05:38.404 --> 05:40.440
to win
another pool with it.

I won the football pool again

slapping me on the back

on the front.

quit now.

to burn the flag.

the football pool anymore.

to be angry with me.

Well, if you think
they’re angry now

09:44.785 --> 09:46.319
just wait till you tell them
you’re quitting.

09:46.352 --> 09:48.321
Well, cousin, what if
I explain to them that

09:48.354 --> 09:50.724
if I quit they’ll have
a better chance of winning?

09:50.757 --> 09:53.259
Well, Balki, no, they,
they don’t just want to win.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.995
They want
to beat you.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.764
Beat me?

Cousin, it’s just a game.
Don’t let them beat me.

No, no, no, no, no. They don’t
wanna beat you with a stick.

in the pool.

it was complicated

make your, make your picks?

I’ll make my picks later.

I got to...

the hash browns out of my pants.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.898
Balki, what’s wrong?

10:31.932 --> 10:34.835
Well, for the past five weeks

10:34.868 --> 10:37.203
I’ve been playing
the football pool at work.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.705
Yeah?

10:38.739 --> 10:41.341
And for the past
five weeks, I’ve won.

get anybody down.

with me for winning

to play anymore.

you just quit?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.292

but Cousin Larry said

10:59.325 --> 11:01.194
that‐that would only make
people angrier

just want to win

just let them?

11:08.802 --> 11:11.838
Well, well how I do that?

11:11.872 --> 11:13.840
Well, just
pick all the losers.

11:13.874 --> 11:14.941
That way
you’d still be playing

11:14.975 --> 11:17.210

could win.

’And the Chiefs
beat the Jets, 45‐3.’

12:58.111 --> 13:00.080
[cheering]

13:00.113 --> 13:03.183
I did it! I did it.
I lost every game!

13:03.216 --> 13:05.552
‐I’m so proud of you.
‐Oh.

13:05.586 --> 13:08.354
Thank you, Mary Anne, it will be
so nice to go to work tomorrow

13:08.388 --> 13:10.423
and not have
people throw food at me.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.094
Why wasn’t Larry
here to watch the games?

13:14.127 --> 13:16.262
Oh, he went
to the sports grill.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.599
They have ten
television sets there

13:18.632 --> 13:20.901
so you can watch
all the games at one time.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.403
I bet he’s having
the time of his life.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.021
Cousin, are you alright?

13:43.289 --> 13:47.193
Mary Anne, could I talk
to, uh, Balki alone?

13:48.895 --> 13:50.363
I don’t see why not.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.569
Oh, now.

13:55.602 --> 13:56.937
[chuckles]
Sure.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.139
I gotta go anyway.
Bye, Balki.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.273
Bye, Mary Anne.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.383
Balki, do you realize

14:10.416 --> 14:13.654
you‐you didn’t pick
one single winning team?

14:13.687 --> 14:15.355
I know,
isn’t it wonderful?

14:17.624 --> 14:20.460
‐How did you know?
‐I copied your picks.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.529
Cousin, I’m
surprised at you.

14:22.563 --> 14:23.997
You know
cheaters never win.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.966
I know now.

14:29.302 --> 14:33.106
How could you lose
every game?

14:34.407 --> 14:36.309
Well, you know, cousin,
in a way...

14:36.342 --> 14:37.978
...it was your idea.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.346
See, you said that...

14:40.380 --> 14:43.984
You‐you said that people
would be happy if they beat me

14:44.017 --> 14:46.953
so I decided to pick
all the losers

14:46.987 --> 14:48.889
and make
everybody happy.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.625
Not everybody.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.264
Balki...

14:58.298 --> 15:00.433
...I used your picks

15:00.466 --> 15:03.937
and bet $10,000
with a bookie.

15:05.271 --> 15:09.275
You bet $10,000
with a librarian?

15:13.313 --> 15:15.015
A bookie, a bookie...

15:15.048 --> 15:18.418
...a bookie is someone who
takes bets on sporting events

15:18.451 --> 15:22.288
and now I owe
this guy $10,000.

15:23.557 --> 15:25.992
Oh, boy, boy...

15:27.360 --> 15:30.396
Cousin, you know, on Mypos
we have one of them guys

15:30.430 --> 15:32.032
Jimmy, the geek.

15:36.637 --> 15:40.406
When you bet on the sheep races
and you don’t pay up

15:40.440 --> 15:43.009
he shaves your head
and calls you baldy

15:43.043 --> 15:44.444
in front
of your parents.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.517
It’s ugly,
very ugly.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.387
Well, Balki,
this is America.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.723
Things are a little
different here.

15:56.757 --> 15:58.491
When bookies aren’t paid

15:58.525 --> 16:01.662
they have been known
to break legs.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.764
Cousin, we, we can’t
let them do that.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.231
I’m going
to call the police!

16:05.265 --> 16:07.400
No! No, no, no, no.
Balki, Balki, Balki.

16:07.433 --> 16:08.769
You‐you can’t call the police.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.170
Cousin, we have to.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.505
What they’re
going to do is illegal.

16:11.538 --> 16:12.773
So is betting
with a bookie.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.407
Cousin, how could
you do something

16:14.440 --> 16:15.509
you know was illegal?

16:15.542 --> 16:17.678
I don’t know, I did it.
It was stupid. I’m sorry.

16:17.711 --> 16:19.245
But‐but‐but
what am I gonna do?

16:19.279 --> 16:21.615
Balki, he knows my name.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.617
He knows where I live.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.553
He knows where
I keep my knees.

16:31.625 --> 16:33.159
Oh, cousin.

16:35.061 --> 16:37.130
What are you
going to do?

16:37.163 --> 16:40.400
Well, there’s
only one thing I can do.

16:41.535 --> 16:43.403
I’ll bet
another $10,000

16:43.436 --> 16:45.606
on tomorrow night’s game.

16:45.639 --> 16:47.674
Cousin, I don’t know
much about the game

16:47.708 --> 16:51.077
but if they’ll break
your legs for $10,000...

16:52.112 --> 16:54.247
...for 20,000,
they might break

16:54.280 --> 16:56.416
something you really need.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.157
Well, that’s not
gonna happen

17:05.191 --> 17:07.359
because after you pick
tomorrow night’s winner...

17:07.393 --> 17:09.663
...I’ll be even. Alright,
let’s see, who’s playing?

17:09.695 --> 17:11.698
Now, wait just a minute.
Not so fast.

17:11.732 --> 17:12.799
What? What‐what is it?

17:12.833 --> 17:14.200
Cousin, the only way

17:14.233 --> 17:15.836
I’m going
to go along with this

17:15.868 --> 17:18.070
is if you promise to never

17:18.104 --> 17:22.608
and I mean,
never, ever, ever

17:22.643 --> 17:24.778
bet on
a football game again.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.714
Balki, I promise never

17:27.748 --> 17:31.351
and I mean, never,
ever, ever, ever

17:31.384 --> 17:33.353
to bet on
a football game again.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.721
And promise you’ll take me
to Disney World.

17:34.755 --> 17:37.057
And I promise,
I’ll take you to... Balki...

17:39.893 --> 17:41.461
Sorry, it was
worth a shot.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.664
Okay, I’ll help you.

17:43.697 --> 17:45.098
Alright, alright.

17:45.131 --> 17:48.502
Now, do whatever
you need to do

17:48.535 --> 17:51.404
to get your sheepherder’s
intuition to kick in.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.273
Oh, I just need
to relax.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.608
‐You need to relax?
‐Yeah.

17:55.776 --> 17:57.310
Here, put your feet up.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.247
Here. Pillow? Pillow?

18:01.281 --> 18:02.415
Alright.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.585
Anything else?

18:04.618 --> 18:06.587
Uh, could you get me Dmitri?

18:15.261 --> 18:16.763
Could you dim the lights?

18:20.701 --> 18:21.768
Alright.

18:21.802 --> 18:24.771
Alright, here we go.

18:25.906 --> 18:27.140
Ready?

18:28.642 --> 18:29.643
Alright.

18:29.676 --> 18:33.614
The Packers and the Browns.
Who’s gonna win?

18:34.548 --> 18:36.449
Browns, Packers

18:36.482 --> 18:39.152
Browns or Packers,
Browns or Packers...

18:41.421 --> 18:43.156
What are my choices again?

18:45.225 --> 18:46.359
The Browns...

18:46.392 --> 18:47.861
...or the Packers!

18:47.894 --> 18:52.498
The Browns or the Packers!

18:52.533 --> 18:55.301
I don’t know, cousin, I can’t do
it under this much pressure.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.237
Alright, alright.
Relax, relax, relax.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.172
Relax, relax.

18:59.205 --> 19:00.774
There’s no pressure.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.409
There’s no pressure.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.511
It’s just...

19:04.545 --> 19:05.679
...my life!

19:07.581 --> 19:10.717
The Browns
or the Packers?

19:10.751 --> 19:11.918
The Browns.

19:11.952 --> 19:13.219
‐The Browns?
‐Yes.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.287
‐The Browns?
‐The Browns.

winning this game.’

the ball throw on 25.’

’Salos back to pass.’

19:26.700 --> 19:27.968
’Chased out of the pocket.’

19:28.001 --> 19:30.403
’Going long intercepted
by the Browns!’

19:30.436 --> 19:31.705
Yes! Yes!

19:31.738 --> 19:33.940
Balki, all the Browns
have to do to win

19:33.974 --> 19:36.242
is to run out
30 seconds on the clock.

I owe you my legs

19:46.252 --> 19:48.354
and anything else
that might have been broken.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.525
‐You’re welcome, cousin.
‐Hmm.

19:51.558 --> 19:54.995
Boy, after that yelling,
I could use a soda.

‐You want one?
‐Sure. Love one.

He hands off to Taylor.’

the Packers at the 20.’

He’s at the 40.’

20:05.939 --> 20:07.941

‐He’s at the 50.
‐’He’s at the 50.’

‐No.
